1. f4 c5 {This reply to Bird's opening allows Black the option of placing a pawn on d6 to prevent a White knight from reaching e5.  The main line is 1 ... d5, heading for a Dutch Defense Reversed with the main fight over control of e5, a line that can also be reached by way of the more flexible 1 ... g6.  Finally, for those who like immediate fireworks there's From's Gambit, 1 ... e5.} 2. Nf3 {2 e4 g6 transposes to the Sicilian Grand Prix Attack} Nf6 3. c4 {3 e4 would once again transpose to the Grand Prix Attack, but with Black's knight already on f6.} Nc6 4. e3 {Black has the option of a Sicilian Dragon type setup with d7-d6 shutting the Knight out of e5 and g7-g6 and B8-g7 bringing pressure along the a1-h8 diagonal.   White decides to counter by forcing an immediate d2-d4, but Black already has a slight pull because of the awkwardness of White's pawn structure. } g6 5. d4 {White is already falling behind in development, and forcing the issue on d4 adds to his problems by further weakening the central squares.  The less committal 5 Nc3 Bg6 6 Be2 d6 7 0-0 0-0 would probably have been better.} cxd4 {The most logical way to attack White's pawn center.  This exchange and Black's next move remove pawn support for d4, fix White's d pawn as a target on the soon to be hot diagonal, and give Black the half-open c file.  If White then plays cxd5, he's left with an isolated d pawn and the pawn cover for his king has been disrupted on both wings.  For Black, 5 ... cxd4 and 6 ... d5 has the drawback of weakening e5, but White's weak pawns, lagging development and difficulty castling minimize the threat of a knight on e5. } 6. exd4 d5 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. cxd5 {This causes more problems for White than it solves.  On the other hand, after 8 c5 or 8 Be3 the d pawn is still a fixed target, and White is flirting with a new positional problem, a bad dark-square bishop (compare the game jwh1234-eddieleggs, 7-Mar-2008).} Nxd5 9. Qb3 {A reasonable alternative was 9 Bc4 Nb6 10 Bb3 0-0 11 Be3 Bg4 12 h3 Bxf3.} Nb6 10. d5 {Better than 10 Be3 Be6 11 Qa3 0-0 AND 10 bB5 0-0 11 bXC6 BXC6.  On the other hand, White's going to have trouble finding a secure refuge for his king, and the transfer of the Black bishop to the a7-g1 diagonal makes this even more difficult.} Nd4 {There was no point in allowing the knight to be deflected to a5, or to create a traffic jam among Black's pieces on e7.  } 11. Nxd4 {Virtually forced.  Very bad is 11 Qd1 Bg4 12 Be3 Bxf3 13 gxf3 Nf5 14 Bf2  Bxc3 15 bxc3 Qc716 Bb5  Kf8.  Not quite so bad (but not good) is 11 Bb5  Nxb5 12 Qxb5 Bd7 13 Qb3 Qc714 0-0 Nc4 15 Kh1 0-0 16 Ne5 Rac8.} Bxd4 12. Bb5+ {White's first priority should be to get Black's bishop off the a7-g1 diagonal, so the best move here is 12 Nb5.  Black will have at best a minimal edge after the bishop retreats to f6 or g7 (e.g., 12 ... Bf6 13 Be3 0-0 14 Rd1 Bf5 15 Be2 Be4 16 0-0 Nxd5 17 Bc4 e6 18 Bxa7 Rxa7 19 Nxa7), and White gets a bonus if Black falls into 12 ... Bc5? 13 Qc3.  } Bd7 13. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {13 ... Qxd7 is playable, as well, with pressure against d5, but the knight might be needed on the kingside.  The position is reminiscent of the Panov-Botvinnik Attack in the Caro-Kann after 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4 Nf6 5 Nc3 Nc6 6 Nf3 Bg4 7 cxd5 Nxd5 8 Qb3 Bxf3 9 gxf3 Nb6 10 d5 Nd4 11 Bb5  Nd7 12 Qa4 Nxb5 13 Qxb5 g6.  White doesn't have the Panov-Botvinnik's doubled f pawn, but Black is a tempo or two ahead, and his bishop prevents 14 0-0.} 14. Ne2 {Best.  Not so good is 14 Qxb7?! Rb8, when neither 15 Qa6 Nc5 16 Qc6  Kf8 17 d6 Kg7 18 Qd5 Qxd6 19 Qxd6 exd6 nor 15 Qc6 0-0  is satisfactory.  White's king is stuck in the center, and he lags badly in development.} Bc5 {14 ... Bb6 is playable, but this keeps a useful  eye on d6.} 15. Bd2 {This makes 0-0-0 possible, but somewhat better was 15 Be3 Qa5  16 Kf2 Nf6 17 Bxc5 Qxc5 18 Kf3 Qxd5  19 Qxd5 Nxd5 20 Rac1 0-0.} O-O 16. f5 {This is White's eighth pawn move, half of his first sixteen.  The logical follow-through to 15 Bd2 0-0 is 16 0-0-0 Nb6 17 Nc3 Rc8 18 Kb1 Qc7 19 Rhe1.  Black still has an advantage, but a smaller one than in the game.} Nf6 {This is less committal than 16 ... Rc8 and puts pressure on the d pawn.  Black could also try 16 ... Qb6 17 0-0-0 Rac8 18 Kb1 Qxb3 19 axb3Nf6 20 fxg6 fxg6 21 Nc3 Ng4, but I wanted to keep the queens on the board.} 17. fxg6 hxg6 18. Nc3 {The d pawn is now defended, but White's king is still on its original square and his bishop passively posted.   } Qd7 {Once again, this is more flexible than 18 ... Rc8 19 0-0-0 Qc7.  As it turns out, the Black queen's rook can serve very well from a8 by supporting the advance of the a pawn.  } 19. O-O-O {White's alternatives were less attractive:  1) 19 Rf1 Qg4 20 Gb5 Bd6 21 Qe2 Bxh2 or 2) 19 Qa4 Rfd8 20 Qxc7 Rxd7 21 0-0-0 Rad8.} Rfc8 {Why not?  Maximum firepower on the queenside.  Whether White plays  20 Rhf1, 20 Kb1, 20 h3 or 20 Rhe1 (as in the game) the answer will be 20 ... a5.} 20. Rhe1 a5 {Black now has a winning advantage.} 21. Bg5 {Slightly better is 21 a4.  The Black a pawn now advances with gain of tempo, forces a weakening of c3, and becomes a permanent thorn in White's side on a3.} a4 22. Qc2 a3 23. Kb1 {The king needs to find shelter.  No better is 23 Bxf6.} Ra6 {This may not be best, even though it turns out well for Black.  23 ... Bd6 24 Rd3 axb2 25 Bxf6 exf6 26 Qxb2 Be5 27 Qb5 Qxb5 28 Nxb5 Rc5 29 Na3 Rac5 is Black's other try.} 24. Bxf6 Rxf6 25. g3 {It's hard to see any purpose behind this move.  Black is threatening 25 ... Bb4 with a double pin on the White knight.  The logical response would be to move either the queen or the e1 rook.  E.g., White might try 25 Qd3 qxb2 26 Ne4 Ra6 27 Nxc5 Rxc5 or 25 Rf1 Rb6 26 Na4 Rb5 27 b3 Qg4 or 25 Qa4 b5 26 Qb3 Rf2.  } Bb4 26. Re3 Rb6 {Black had at least two other options.  Perhaps best was 26 ... axb2 27 d6 Rxd6 28 Rxd6 Bxd6 29 Rd3 Qc6 30 Kxb2 Be5 31 a3 Qb5 , but 26 ... Qc7 27 Qb3 Rb6 28 Na4 Rb5 29 d6 was also playable.} 27. b3 {With his last few moves White has broken one of the pins on his knight and removed the threat of axb2, but at the cost of depriving the knight of pawn support and leaving Black with a very annoying pawn on a3. } Rb5 {Since 27 b3 temporarily relieves the pressure against b2, Black decides to switch gears.  The objective is no longer an attack but winning the d pawn and wholesale exchanges that lead to a won endgame.} 28. Rd4 {The only try:  28 Rde1 Rbc5 29 Rxe7 Rxc3 30 Rxd7 Rxc2 31 Re8  Rxe8 32 Kxc2 Re2  33 Kd3 Rxa2-+; or 28 d6 exd6 29 Red3 Rbc5 30 Rxd6 Qe8 31 Qe4 Bxc3 32 Qxe8 Rxe8-+.} Bxc3 {Black could have played 28 ... Ba5, but there was no point in getting tangled up in complications such as a possible rook sacrifice on f7 or g6.  Now all the pieces will be exchanged, leaving Black with a won king and pawn endgame.} 29. Rxc3 Rxc3 30. Qxc3 Rxd5 31. Rxd5 {The rooks have to go:  31 Rf4 Rd3 32 Qc1 Rd1.} Qxd5 {Black is a pawn ahead, but what make his advantage decisive are his superior king position, his pawn on a3, and his passed e pawn.  After an exchange of queens Black will win the king and pawn endgame by advancing his e and f pawns supported by his king.  And the queens must go.  White can't defend against Black's mate threats on b2 and d1, as well as threats against his g and h pawns, while handicapped by a king with absolutely no pawn cover.  The immediate threat is 32 ... Qd1 , forcing the exchange of queens.} 32. Qc4 {This obviously fails to prevent the exchange of queens, but the two likeliest alternatives are no better:  32 Qc1 Gf5  33 Qc2 Qf1  33 Qc1 Qxc1  34 Kxc1 f5 and we've transposed to the game; 32 Kc2 e5 33 Qd2 Qxd2  34 Kxd2 f5 and Black wins.  Worse is 32 Qc8  Kg7 33 Qc3  (after 33 Qc4 Qd1  34 Qc1 Qxc1  35 Kxc1 f5 Black has gained a tempo over the game continuation) e5 34 Kc2 Qg2  35 Qd2 Qxd2  36 f5, when Black is a tempo ahead of the 32 Kc2 variation given above.  A final try is 32 b4, opening a path to the Black a pawn:  32 ...Qd1  33 Qc1 Qxc1  (or Black can play ... Qf3 34 Qd2 e5 35 Kd2 e4 and try to jam the e pawn down White' throat) 34 Kxc1 f5 35 Kd2 (there's no time to capture the a pawn:  35 Kc2 e5 36 Kb3 f4) Kf7 36 Ke3 e5 and Black wins as in the game.} Qd1+ 33. Qc1 Qxc1+ 34. Kxc1 f5 35. Kd2 e5 36. h3 Kf7 {The king comes to the center.  White has no chance of counterplay on the queenside because his king can't leave the square of the f pawn (36 b4 Ke6 37 Kc2 f4 and after either 38 g4 g5 or 38 gxf4 exf4 the White king can't go to the b file).} 37. Ke2 Kf6 38. Ke3 g5 {Another road to the win is 38 ... Ke6 39 Kd3 Kd5, but there was no need to move the king any farther toward the center than necessary.  After the text, Black wins easily because White has no way to slow down the e and f pawns:  39 h4 gxh4 40 gxh4 f4  and connected passed pawns rule; 39 g4 e4 40 Kd4 b6 41 Ke3 Ke5 42 gxf5 Kxf5 and wins; 39 b4 f4  40 gxf4 (40 Kf2/3 fxg3 41 Kxg3 e4 42 b5 Ke5 43 Kg2 (43 Kg4 Kd4) Kd4 and wins.  } 39. Kd3 f4 40. g4 {After 40 gxf4 gxf4 41 Ke4 Kg5 the h pawn falls.} f3 {The pawns don't need to be defended by the king, since capturing the laggard pawn allows the remaining pawn to queen.} 41. Ke3 e4 42. Kf2 Ke6 {Triangulation to lose a tempo.} 43. b4 Ke5 44. Ke3 b5 {Zugzwang.} 45. Kd2 f2 {White resigned in light of 46 Ke2 e3 47 Kf1 Kf4 48 Kg2 (48 Ke2 Ke4 49 Kf1 Kf3 50 h4 e2#) Ke4 49 h4 (49 Kf1 Kf3) gxh4 50 Kh3 (50 g5 h3  51 Kf1 f2) f1Q  .}
