1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd8 {the theory usually recomends 3..Qa5} 4. Bc4 e6 5. Nf3 Nd7 6. d4 h6 7. O-O a6 8. Re1 {now, Bd5 or Nd5 is possible} Nb6 9. Bb3 Bb4 10. Ne5 Ne7 11. Qg4 {11..0-0 is not possible because of 12.Bxh6!} Nf5 {Now white can force a queen exchange with 12.Qxf5 exf5 13. Nc6  , but further analysis will find a better move} 12. Nxf7 {the oldest trick in the book, exploiting the weakness of f7} Kxf7 {if not, white will be an exchange and pawn up. Perhaps it would have offered better chances for black} 13. Qxf5+ {exploiting the pin on the a2-g8 diagonal} Ke7 {maybe 13..Kg8 would have offered better chances of survival} 14. Rxe6+ {bringing the artillery into play} Kd7 {if 14..Bxe6, 15.Qxe6 Kf8 15.Qf7# (again, f7)} 15. Rxb6+ {checkmate in two} Ke8 {e7 or e8, Qf7 ends the game} 16. Qf7# {a miniature}
