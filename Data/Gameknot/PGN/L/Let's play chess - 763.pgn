1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 {We have one of the main lines of the french winawer variation here.} cxd4 {considered better is Bxc3, white gets good initiative, even though my pawns are weakened.} 6. axb4 dxc3 7. Qg4 Kf8 8. Nf3 cxb2 {It's dangerous to open lines for my bishop, which usually is bad in french lines.} 9. Bxb2 Qc7 10. Bd3 Nc6 {a poor move - this lets me play b5 with tempo. I aim to play b5 either way, to bring my bishop to the very active a3-f8 diagonal.} 11. b5 Nce7 12. O-O Nh6 13. Qg5 Nhf5 14. Ba3 h6 15. Qd2 {I threaten Bxf5 with Qxd5.} Ke8 16. g4 {the knight is trapped!} Bd7 17. gxf5 exf5 18. Bxe7 Kxe7 19. Qb4+ Ke6 {Much much better is Ke8 or Kd8; however both of those moves run into b6! with me winning more material.} 20. Nd4+ {Now black is just mated.} Kxe5 21. Qe7+ Kxd4 22. Qe3+ Kc3 23. Be2+ Kb4 24. Rfb1# {}
