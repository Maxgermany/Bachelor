1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 Nc6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Bd2 {A trade off between aggression and defence.  The pin is broken but there is not any immediate pressure being placed against black's king side.} d6 6. h3 {Restricting Black's light square bishop and making the way clear for Nf3. } Be6 {Protecting the bishop's pawn and threatening an exchange which will double white pawns and thus weaken the King's pawn. } 7. a3 Ba5 8. b4 Bb6 {This is a questionable maneuver, the black bishop has been driven to a more useful diagonal by a pawn charge which has no sustainable attack.} 9. Nf3 Nd4 10. O-O O-O 11. Bg5 c6 {It would appear that black is preparing to launch an attack aimed as disrupting white’s central pawn structure} 12. Nxd4 {?} Bxd4 {Forces white to tie up either the queen or the bishop or lose material} 13. Qd2 d5 14. exd5 cxd5 15. Bb3 Qd7 {Black now has a very strong king side attack whilst white’s queen is tied to the knight and cannot assist in the defence.} 16. Bxf6 {White has given the only active piece on the king side and allowed black to half open the file in front of the white king.} gxf6 17. Rae1 {? In breaking the knight pin white has trapped his king’s rook } Bxh3 18. gxh3 Qxh3 19. Ne2 Kh8 20. Ng3 Qxg3+ 21. Kh1 Qh3+ 22. Kg1 Rfg8+ 23. Qg5 Rxg5# {}
