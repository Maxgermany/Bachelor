1. e4 { Best by test.} e6 { Introducing the french defense. One of the best answers for 1.e4.} 2. d4 { The most logical answer. Controlling the center.} d5 { challenging  white's center.} 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 { This is  the Winawer, advanced variation.} c5 5. a3 cxd4 {The Rauzer variation. I think better is 5...Bxc3+} 6. axb4 dxc3 7. Qg4 cxb2 8. Bxb2 g6 9. Nf3 Nh6 10. Qf4 Nf5 11. Bd3 { White is down a pawn, but he has the advantage.} Nc6 {11...Nc6? inaccuracy. I think better is 11...Bd7.} 12. b5 {12.b5!} Nce7 { Better was 12...Nb8 though it loses a tempo  because of white next move.} 13. g4 { if black had played 12...Nb8, now he could have played 13...Nh4.} Ng7 { Forced.} 14. Qf6 Kf8 { if 14...0-0? 15.Ba3 Re8 16.Ng5! wins. and if 14...Rf8 15.Ng5  followed by Nxh7 also wins. so, it seems this is black best move.} 15. b6 {15.b6!} a6 {forced as 15...Qxb6? 16.Ng5! wins and if 15...axb6? 16.Rxa8 also wins.} 16. Ba3 Bd7 17. Ng5 { White now have a desicive advantage, i think.} Qe8 { Forced.} 18. h4 {18.h4!! white intends h5 then hxg6 or h6. Now, black has no hope. He can wait till white mates him.} h6 {if 18...h5? 19.Bxg6! What else can black do?} 19. h5 {19.h5! white allows black to capture his knight as he has a forced win.} hxg5 20. h6 {Now, mate is unavoidable. (if the knight on g7 moves, Qxh8#)} Rg8 {Now, it is mate in 5 (puzzle #35234).   20...Rxh6 would last longer 21.Rxh6 Kg8 22.Kd2 followed by Rah1 mates few moves later.  } 21. hxg7+ Rxg7 { Forced.} 22. Rh8+ Rg8 { Forced again.} 23. Bxg6 {23.Bxg6!} Rc8 {anyother move, white still plays 24.Bh7 or 24.Bh5 mate next. (of course if 23...Rxh4 24.Qxh8# as the knight is pinned.)} 24. Bh7 {or 24.Bh5, mate next. Black resigns.}
