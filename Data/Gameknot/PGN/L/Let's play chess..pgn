1. d4 {I must say, this is the best correspondence game I've ever played so far. Though my opponent made a gross error at the end, the outcome would have been in my favour anyway, it seems. So hope you enjoy.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Bg5 Nbd7 {Before chasing away the g5 bishop I reinforce the f6 knight so I can take back with a knight. But this is a mistake or at least makes it possible to force the exchange of dark-squarded bishops with 6. Qd2.} 6. Nf3 {I felt relieved because now I have time to play h6 and castle without being harassed along the c1/h6-diagonal with the queen on d2.} h6 7. Bh4 O-O 8. Bd3 a6 {It's uncertain whether white wants to castle longside or shortside. So I refrain from making a decision in the center. Since the dark-squared bishop is off the c1/h6-diagonal the c3 knight is vulnerable making a queenside pawn storm less likely at this point. So I opted for a6 instead of a5.} 9. Qc2 {White keeps the option of castling either side. Good move. Plus he wants to exert pressure along my g6 pawn. At this point I hoped he'd castle longside, since the black pawn moves ...e5 and ...f5 are very hard to accomplish.} c6 {I stick to my wait and prepare strategy. } 10. O-O-O {This means the game would be way more tactical instead of a gruesome positional grip he could have exerted when castling shortside. In fact from studying my opponents games I just expected this, since he is more into tactical play and often sacrifices pawns and material in general. A positional approach with 10. 0-0 would have been harder to come by.} Qa5 {Before attacking his impressive center with ...c5 I saw that I can keep back his center push e5 by one more move by bringing my queen aggressively to the a-file.} 11. Rhe1 {So he reinforces the e-file in order to make his push.} e5 {I decided that it would be too dangerous to allow that. So I felt more comfortable blocking his cannons on e1, d3 and c2. Alas he can open up the d-file now for his rook on d1.} 12. h3 {He decides to retain the pressure in the center and prepares a kingside pawn storm. I welcome this. It keeps all options regarding center development on the table.} b5 {Fortunately my strike comes first.} 13. b3 {Reinforcing the c-pawn. But this enables black to maximize active piece play.} exd4 {I saw that my dark-squared bishop can play a major role along the a1/h8-diagonal. I must play for most active piece play or white will squeeze me.} 14. Nxd4 Ne5 {Naturally bringing the knight into the game thereby attacking the d3 bishop and defending the c6 pawn.} 15. Nde2 {I was astounded by this mistake. Retreating the knight wasn't necessary at all. I guess, my opponent didn't feel comfortable and wanted to overly secure things. Taming the feeling of unease by a quick "save" move that is abandoning rational, cool calculation is what I see often. I actually prepared for: 15. f5, Nxd3+ 16. Rxd3, bxc4 (opening up the king's position) 17. bxc4, Qc7 (defening the c6 pawn) with a roughly equal game.} Nxd3+ {Now I simply win the a-pawn, because I can chase away the defending knight on c3 by the pawn push b4. } 16. Qxd3 {If white tries to keep the a-pawn doubly defended by  16. Rxd3, I snap the e4 pawn by  16. ... Nxe4 which cannot be taken since that would loose the exchange: 17. Nc3xe4, Qxe1+} Qa3+ {Of course it's mandatory to check the king first, since 16. ...b4 leads to the blocking move 17. Na4} 17. Kd2 {Kb1 would loose the e4 pawn. But that would have been way better than moving towards the center. 17. Kb1, Nxe4.  And it's impossible to take with the knight: 18. Nc3xe4 leads to Qb2 checkmate and 18. Qxe4 allows skewering the queen with Bf5.} b4 18. Na4 Qxa2+ {So I harvest the a-pawn with check.} 19. Ke3 {Since trying to clarify the situation by exchanging queens by 19. Kc1 or 19. Qc2 isn't possible for the then hanging pawn on e4, White goes for another idea: and that is to trap my awkwardly placed queen.} d5 {Of course, I need to open up the board as quickly as possible with the king in the center and my queen about to come under attack.} 20. f3 {Much too quiet. With the king in the center white must simplify as much as possible. For instance: Bxf6 and Nb6. Note that trying to trap the queen isn't working: 20. Ra1, dxe4 (equally attacking the white queen)  } dxe4 {I happily open the tin. } 21. fxe4 Nxe4 {Another move to open up the center. I was preparing for 22. Qxe4 (22. Kxe4 looses to 22. ...Bf5+, winning the queen) 22. ...Qxb3+ forking the king and the knight on a4.} 22. Nc1 {Frankly I didn't see this move. Isn't it giving away yet another pawn and frees my queen? Yes, but it wins the knight on e4. Fortunately the white's king position is so exposed that taking the knight only helps black.} Qxg2 {So I shift to the after side and prepared for: 23. Qxe4, Qxh3+ 24. Kf2, g5 25. Bg3, f5 26. Qg2, f4 27. Qxh3, Bxh3 with 4 pawns for the knight and a good domination of the board. } 23. Reh1 {Puzzled!! Huge mistake which actually ends the game. I guess the idea was to trap my queen with Rdg1.} Ng5 {I simply save my knight and can keep going for the white's king. The knight gives me control over f3.} 24. Bxg5 {To exchange the assumed useless bishop leads to a forced mate. But all other options soon loose, too.} Re8+ 25. Kf4 hxg5# {Checkmate. So 23. Rh1 actually spoiled the game by giving up the fight. But maybe it was fun to watch anyway. Cheers.}
