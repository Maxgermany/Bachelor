[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {Reti, I've not got a lot of experience with this opening so this was a little bit of a gamble for me} e6 2. c4 d5 3. g3 Nf6 4. d4 dxc4 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. O-O Nd5 {This is one of those moves that looks out of place for me as it moves the knight for a second time before black is developed fully and without being forced to. Having said that it is still in the gameknot database so I guess it does have some merit, though quite what I am unsure.} 7. e4 {This is the last move in the gameknot database.} Nf6 8. Bg5 {I preferred this to the possibly more natural Nc3 as it seemed a bit more agressive} Be7 {I'm not sure about the timing of this move, it seems a little uneccessary, I can't help but feel that it could have waited and perhaps black could have looked at getting his lsb into a better position} 9. Nc3 h6 10. d5 {I played this in an attempt to be aggressive and to not be too predictable, though with hindsight I am not sure it was the best} exd5 11. Bxf6 {Again perhaps not the best but I was trying to avoid being too passive.} Bxf6 12. exd5 Ne5 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14. Re1 {Now the dust has finally settled a little I have a reasonable hold on the centre, black's pawn structure is slightly weaker on his kingside where he is most likely to castle and the pin on the bishop is intended to force a reaction from black} O-O {I was suprised by this as I was expecting  something like Qf6} 15. Rxe5 {not only has black thrown away the bishop pair but he seems to have totally conceded the intiative, I need to gather my forces to form an attack} Qd6 16. Qe2 {eyeing up the c4 pawn} Bd7 17. Re1 {At this point I had in mind Ne4 to push the black queen away from the lsb but for that to work I needed to defend my rook on e5} b5 18. f4 b4 {Forces me to do what I want} 19. Ne4 Qb6+ 20. Kh1 Rae8 21. Qxc4 {defending the d5 pawn and also lining up against the black king} a5 22. Nd2 Qf2 {This was a bit of a bolt from the blue as I am not clear that black can make enough of this} 23. Nf3 Bh3 24. Qf1 Qxf1+ {being ahead on material I had no major issue with exchanging queens} 25. Bxf1 Bd7 26. Re5xe8 Bxe8 {Surely Rxe8 is better, I can only think that black wanted to avoid another rook exchange however in this position it will take a little while for the black rook to get into action. I was more interested in the black c pawn and how I might be able to make my d pawn a passer} 27. Rc1 {the c pawn must fall} Bd7 28. Rxc7 Bg4 29. Ne5 {pressuring the f7 pawn in an attempt to divert blacks attention from my newly passed pawn on d. The combination of pieces I have remaining should be enough to ensure promotion for this pawn, if needed I have Nc6 as an option if black tries to prevent promotion with his rook} Bf5 30. Bc4 {indirectly pressures the f pawn even further. This move turns out to be important in the end of the game} Bg6 {This is surely a mistake from black as d6 pins the black pawn, threatening Nxg6} 31. g4 {With hindsight this was probably unneccessary but I was trying to prevent Bf5 and a possible bishop sacrifice, the previously mentioned d6 is surely better} Be4+ 32. Kg1 g5 {I dont really understand this move though blacks options were limited, e.g. Rd8 would lead to Nxf7} 33. d6 {better late than never} gxf4 34. Nxf7 {preventing Rd8 and threatening something like Nxh6+} Bg6 35. Nxh6+ {this is a mistake on my part, much better seems to be Ne5+} Kh8 36. d7 {And now promotion is pretty much unstoppable} f3 37. Rc8 Kg7 38. g5 {Looking to keep blacks king cornered in case I had missed something} f2+ {At this point I was pleased that my bishop was guarding the F1 square or I would have been in trouble} 39. Kf1 Rf4 40. d8=Q {And black resigned.   Thanks for reading please comment.}
