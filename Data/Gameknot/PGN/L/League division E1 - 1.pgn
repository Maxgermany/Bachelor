Rxe7 Kxe7 49. c7 Kxf6 50. c8=Q {~ my defeat is almost certain. No way my poor pawns will be able to promote. But I have sometihng else up my sleeve :)} Kg5 {Vain attempt to guard both pawns.} 51. Qg8+ {Checked in hopes of a skewer.} Kf4 {But moving close to his King will not help me.} 52. Qf7+ {Pushing me further towards the enemy.} Ke3 {Probably not the best place for my King.} 53. Qf3+ {The fork is achieved!} Kd4 {Reunited with another isolated pawn, but the other is no more.} 54. Qxg3 {A satifying capture, I'm sure.} e4 {Okay - can I get a Queen?} 55. Qg4 {A pin - he wants another skewer in order to clear the board of black pawn islands.} Kd3 {I'll resist.} 56. Qf5 {Another pin, another attack on my pawn.} Kd4 {I'll leave a path to advance my pawn.} 57. Qxa5 {Concession.} e3 {Please!} 58. b4 {Oops! King wants another wife?} e2 {I want a wife!} 59. b5 {Bet I'll get a Queen before you get another!} Kd3 {Armed escort!} 60. Qe1 {Oops, there goes my promotion square!} Ke3 {Let's hide where we can.} 61. Qxe2+ {Sacrifice! Nevermind, you'll get her back.} Kxe2 {I accept :)} 62. b6 {I'm too far away.} Kd3 {I'll chase.} 63. b7 {nothing I can do to stop it.} Kc2 {Can I kill the doubled pawn? NO!} 64. b8=Q {Look who is back?} Kb1 {Another place to hide.} 65. b4 {This is ill-advised.} Kb2 {I'll follow.} 66. b5 {I will not be able to stop it. But something else is in mind!} Kb3 {Just be patient.} 67. b6 {I see the possible folly of a Second Queen.} Kb4 {By now someone might be overconfident.} 68. b7 {Just get out of his way, already!} Kb5 {I see the bushes - I'll hide!} 69. Qc7 {Don't some any closer! This is perhaps the biggest mistake in the world - and he does not see it until it's all over!} Ka6 {The bushes at last! Now just promote to Rook and it will be over!} 70. b8=Q {NO! You fool! I can't go anywhere! a 70-move STALEMATE!}
