[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {Classic} e5 {Black responds with a classical opening, I prefer a modern opening: The Sicilian Defense, but to each his own.} 2. Nf3 f6 {?!?!?!?!?!?!  A awful move that not only fails to protect the e5 pawn (See next move) but does not develop any pieces either.} 3. Nxe5 {! A trick opening that leads to no disadvantages for White.  If Black recaptures than White goes on a forceful attack ...fxe5? 4. Qh5+!, Ke7 (...g6 leads to the capture of Black's Rook) 5. Qxe5+, Kf7 6. Bc4+, d5 (...Kg6 leads to 7. Qf5+, Kh6 8. d4+, g5 9. h4, no move can save black now... 10. hxg5+, Kg7 11. Qf7#) back to the main line 7. Bxd5+, Kg6 8. Bxb7!, (Black cannot take back because it is protecting the f5 square and white wins blacks rook.  That was a long-winded way of saying that 2 ..., f6?? is a terrible move and fxe5??????? is a worse one.} d6 {A OK move, but now the dark square bishop is trapped} 4. Nf3 {"Not aggressive but fundamentally sound" is what someone may say, but they're wrong.  4. Qh5+! leads to a rook capture.} c6 {? Black removes the best square for his knight and does not accomplish much} 5. d3 {A bad move by me for obvious reasons, 5. d4 is better.} d5 {Black has not moved a non-pawn piece, he will quickly fall behind in development and center control.} 6. exd5 {The flaws of 5. d3 are becoming well known.} cxd5 {Blacks knight has his square back} 7. Nc3 {White establishes better center control and a development lead.} Nc6 {Black tries to catch up.} 8. d4 {This should have been played immediately at move 5.} f5 {I don't get this move, it grabs little center and nothing else.} 9. Bb5 {3 to 1 in development, and Black's only developed piece is pinned.} Bb4 10. Bg5 {Threatens the Queen} Nf6 {One in a bunch of possible moves} 11. Qe2+ {Claims the e-file} Kd7 {? Kf7 is so much better} 12. Ne5+ {Capitalizes on the center and development advantage} Kd6 13. Bf4 {What terrible mockery of chess is this? A Queen, King, Rook fork is on the table!!!  Nf7+ looks like the best move by far.  But Black has no defense to Bf4.} a6 {??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????  The worst move of the game} 14. Nxc6+ {One would expect Nf7++ but Nxc6+ leads to mate} Kd7 {No other move} 15. Nb8# {A beautiful mate.}
