[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 {This is an OTB game I played recently, which I lost in brutal fashion. In the critical position both players actually thought that Black has the advantage! First words of White player after the game were "I was lost", and Black just kept saying "I totally underestimated the attack". It was pretty funny I guess :) This annotation will show that the position was in fact about even but it was Black who needed to be careful. I am annotating the game partly as a way to fully "digest" this loss and hopefully gain some useful learning points for myself, and partly to amuse GK population, especially those that do not play OTB chess (those who do probably have their own horror stories) :) So, lets have fun!} c5 {My faithful Sicilian :) ---  I was pretty shocked when I achieved only 2,5 points out of 6 Black Sicilian games played during the summer, with zero (!?) wins in open Sicilian (2 wins against Grand Prix Attack, 1 draw, 3 losses) and was saved from negative overall score with Black only by 2 straight wins in QGD at the end of the second tournament... Maybe I am getting old? Should I start playing something safer, like Caro-Kann? Time will tell probably... :)} 2. c3 {The Alapin variation. IMHO, the best way to avoid mainline Sicilian while still keeping good winning chances.} Nf6 {This is what I always play against 2.c3. Alternative is 2...d5, which is slightly less popular but has equal value.} 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nf3 {This move order is the most popular due to possibility 5...dc3??; 6.Qd5, which I never actually saw happen other than in blitz games :) 5.cd4 is equal in value while slightly less fancy.} e6 6. cxd4 Nc6 7. Bd3 {The first move that is out of the mainline theory. Usually White plays straightforward 7.Bc4, sometimes 7.Nc3. I never played against this move, but the idea is very typical and not hard to spot - attack on h7 after Black castles. If White later plays Be4 (intending to take on d5) it can be interpreted as a waste of time compared to normal Bc4. The main problem with 7.Bd3 is that it does not pressure Black at all at this moment, so it can be safely said that Black already has full equality.} d6 {Continuing with normal development while putting some pressure against e5, as usual in this type of position. I didn't yet consider 7...Ndb4; 8.Be4, d5; 9. ed6, Bd6 or 7...Bb4; 8.Bd2, Nf4. Both variations give equality, but Black already has that so I felt that there is no need to be aggressive this early.} 8. a3 {This is needed now if White does not want to allow Ndb4 (or Bb4 in any variation). The reason is that after 8.0-0, Ndb4 White can't play 9.Be4 anymore due to 9...d5. Also it allows White to set up his intended pressure on b1-h7 diagonal.} Be7 {Preparing to castle. I wanted to allow White to take on d6 "with gain of tempi", which would give him an isolated d pawn. This is pretty typical in this kind of positions, and I like playing against the isolani :) the position is equal in any case, this is just personal preference.} 9. O-O {The best move, no need to define the centre yet.} O-O {Same logic.} 10. Qe2 {Continuing with the plan started with 7.Bd3, while clearing d1 for the Rf1 if necessary.} a6 {This is a useful waiting move, again allowing White to take on d6 if he wants to while taking control of b5 in case I want to play b5   Bb7 (  Rc8   Na5   Nc4). I also wanted to allow White to play 11.Qe4 undisturbed :)} 11. Nc3 {I expected 11.Qe4 here, when I would probably play 11...f5; 12.ef6, Nf6 with objective equality but an active game with good prospects for winning (due to the lack of symetry in the position). 11.Nc3 is also a good move, although it does allow Black to decide on the pawn structure in the centre.} dxe5 {Alternative is 11...Nc3; 12.bc3, d5 with blocked centre or 12...de5; 13.Ne5, Ne5; 14.Qe5 with a position that is hard to win due to the solid and easily defended pawn structure.} 12. Nxd5 {Pretty much forced. If White allows 12.de5, Nc3; 13.bc3 then his pawn structure will be vulnerable for the rest of the game.} Qxd5 {Alternative 12...ed5; 13.de5, Bg4 is in fact better than the game continuation (because after 12...Qd5 the Queen is exposed and will have to retreat), but I prefered not to have an isolani. I am biased against them a little, I know :)} 13. dxe5 {The position is slightly better for White now, mainly due to more active Bishop pair and prospects for attack on the kingside. I was not worried, because I played a lot of positions resembling this one so I knew that this advantage is not so easy to exploit.} Rd8 {There is no better place for the Rook than an open file, and it is necessary to allow the Bishop to take defensive position on f8 when needed. } 14. Rd1 {Threatening Bh7 with immediate win for White. } Qa5 {The Queen will transfer to b6 or c7 as needed, while in the meanwhile keeping an eye on e5. Ideally, Black would like to play g6   Bf8   Bg7   Rd5 to put maximum pressure on the e5 pawn, but this takes a lot of time and can't be done without some help from White (a loss of few tempi would help immensely). --- Time remaining: White 1:31 Black 1:47} 15. Qe4 {Finally White plays his main idea, and in doing so creates weaknesses in Black's castling position.} g6 {Forced but not tragic, since the Be7 is close enough to provide cover on weakened black squares. Nevertheless, White has the advantage at the moment.} 16. Bh6 {Prevents Bf8, but I felt that this is not the best move available... the thing is that if Black hurries with Bf8   Bg7 then Bg5 can be unpleasant, taking control of d8 square and threatening Bf6. Simple 16.Be3 with 17.b4 gives White a very solid advantage.} Qb6 {Immediately taking advantage of unprecise 16.Bh6. I wanted to provoke 17.b4 in order to make the queenside pawns more vulnerable to an attack later. This move also allows Black to play 17...Nd4 with 18...Nf5 or exchanges on d4 (which help Black to defend his vulnerable kingside).} 17. b4 {This is objectively better then passive defense (17.Qe2 or 17.Rb1). Black can't play 17...a5 due to 18.Be3, Qc7; 19.b5,  so now White has some space on the queenside. The advantage is not alarming, since it is impossible to press simultaneously on both wings. I made two key judgement calls here: I) My opinion was (and still is) that in this position White should actually press his advantage on the queenside and transfer Bh6 back to e3. II) I estimated that White will not play 18.Be3 but will go for the kingside attack, and in that case 17.b4 push could actually be exploited in a counterattack later.} Bd7 {This move is a little unprincipled (17...Nd4 is the logical continuation of previous play), but I didn't want to oversimplify the position when I figured that White will be pursuing what I considered the wrong plan here. When the Bishop comes to e8 it will reinforce the pawn chain, making it difficult to destroy with sacrifices. } 18. h4 {And here we go. White is trying to break Black kingside position with a frontal assault.} Be8 {Now Black has finished his defensive position and is free to use the 4 "unemployed" pieces to indirectly weaken White's attack by putting pressure on the queenside, while both Bishops actually play 2 roles - defensive on the kingside and offensive on the queenside!} 19. h5 {?! After this Black has an equal game. The correct move is again 19.Be3, which prevents 19...Nd4 and keeps the initiative after 19...Qc7; 20.h5. Precision is important in this position - Black is far from being completely helpless so his counterplay needs to be restricted. Direct attacks on the kingside can't succeed at the moment due to overprotected white squares (Be8 is crucial here) and no immediate mating motives on the black squares.} Nd4 {My thinking at this moment was pretty much like this: "This equalises the position. Black has some very interesting counterplay/counterattack motives connected to Rd4 followed by Rad8 (if White takes the Knight), possible Bc6 and Nf5, and even a5 push (when a3 and b4 become targets to Bf8). This can be stopped only by giving up on the kingside attack and retreating Bh6 to e3. After that the game is probably equal but e5, a3 and b4 can become targets, and if the Queen can infiltrate the queenside then Black should have the advantage."} 20. hxg6 {Not mandatory yet but useful in any case, it forces Black to recapture immediately.} hxg6 {20...Nf3?! is not good here because 21.Qf3, hg6 actually improves the position of White Queen, for example 22.Rac1, Bc6; 23.Qg3 creates threats on g6 that did not exist earlier while not giving Black any compensation for this change. --- Time remaining: White: 0:58 Black 1:41 (!) The reason for this discrepancy is the fact that from my previous experience I just employed the common plan for this kind of position while using mostly my opponent's time for making positional evaluations and plans (and some calculation of variations).} 21. Be3 {After 9 minutes of thinking White finally admits that his kingside attack will not happen and retreats the Bishop. The game is still equal but I thought that Black has better prospects due to potential pressure on exposed White pawns. White offers draw, Black after 5 minutes of evaluating the position refuses (the logic is explained above).} Nxf3+ {My thoughts here: "With Knights gone, there is no need to worry about the kingside attack (Nh2 -> Ng4 -> Nf6), and now the game is in positional waters, where Black should have a slight advantage due to less exposed pawns."} 22. gxf3 {Pretty much in desperation (he assessed his positional chances in the same manner as I did), White decided to try and revive his attack on the kingside. Objectively this is weaker than obvious 22.Qf3, Qc7; 23.Be4, Bc6; 24.Bc6, bc6, but will ultimately win the game for White!} Qc6 {And here it is -  the critical position. There are 2 candidate moves here, with different plans involved: A) aggressive 22...Qc6 with either exchange of Queens and slightly better prospects for Black or queenside infiltration by Black Queen and B) passive but safer 22...Qc7 with 23...Bc6 and probably Bf8-Bg7 with pressure against e5. My greatest mistake was that I played 22...Qc6 after only 1 minute of thinking :I Obviously I did calculate the main variations previously but this move was rushed too much. Maybe it does not lose the game yet (I am still analysing), but now things get really tricky.} 23. Qf4 {The obvious move. White can exchange on c6 - the game is objectively equal, but in this case I think that only Black has any winning chances.} Qc3 {Here I thought I might win, while actually any mistake loses the game quickly (if it isn't already lost). The position is tricky, in analysis not even the mighty computer engines could "see" the truth of the position from here on without human help. Variations I was considering were mostly wrongly assessed: A) 24.Be4, Rd1; 25.Rd1, Rd8; 26.Rc1!, Qa3?? (I don't know if anything else helps here); 27.Kg2! is actually an easy win for White B) 24.Rac1, Qa3; 25.Rc7?! (I completely missed 25.Kg2!, Qb4; 26.Be4! (26.Rc4?!, Rd3; 27.Rb4, Rd1; 28.Rb7 with pretty unclear game) and Black is toast in all variations I looked at so  far.) Qb4; 26.Qb4, Bb4; 27.Rb7 actually gives pretty good winning chances but is far from being White's best. --- Time remaining: White: 0:35 Black: 1:32} 24. Rac1 {Chasing the Queen away from the e5 pawn.} Qb3 {?? Maybe this position is already lost, but the correct move had to be either A) 24...Qb2!? with further 25.Kg2, Bf8; 26.Rh1, Bg7; 27.Qh4, Qe5 when Black is at least not getting mated immediately or B) 24...Qa3, when White has to find the correct continuation (25.Kg2!, Qb4; 26.Be4!). The 24...Qb3?? practically forces White to go for the desperate (and unstoppable) mating attack, since 25.Be2? and 25.Qc4? are both pretty hopeless. --- Time remaining: White: 0:13 Black: 1:16} 25. Kg2 {!! Game over... White is going for the mate and Black (to my astonishment) is powerless to stop it.} Bf8 {Now, as is my custom, I calmly started to calculate all variations in order to find the one that will win the game with the least amount of trouble :)  Unfortunately, after 30 minutes I discovered without a shred of doubt that I am in fact so utterly lost that it is hilariously funny that White is actually sweating and not me :) As Theoden would poetically say: "Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountain, like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow. How did it come to this?" Translation: "Why am I hopelessly lost now, when only 3 moves ago everything was going great?" The answer is quite simple really: White has three pieces that attack on the black squares, while Black has only one to stop it... The Rook on h1 is "the missing link" that I didn't fully appreciate in all my calculations and assessments from move 22 onward. --- The rest of the game is pretty straightforward. 25...Rd3; 26.Rh1, Bc6 (26...Re3; 27.Qh6); 27.Rc6, Rd1; 28.Rc1 is also a simple win.} 26. Rdh1 Bg7 {Defending h8 and trying to create some space for the King.} 27. Qh2 {The first threat is 28.Qh7, Kf8; 29.Bc5#} Rac8 {Defending the c5 square. Unfortunately there is another threat, and that one is unstoppable.} 28. Bg5 {Mate in 6} Bc6 {28...f6 is just too pathetic to be played. Now I decided to play to the end, and of course if White somehow slips... :)} 29. Qh7+ {He didn't slip :I 29.Qh8?? is spectacular but incorrect, since it loses to 29...Bh8; 30.Rh8, Kh8; 31.Rh1, Kg8; 32.Bf6, Bf3 Time remaining: White: 0:06 Black: 0:24} Kf8 30. Qh8+ {Other option is 30.Qg7, with the same result (mate in 3)} Bxh8 31. Rxh8+ Kg7 32. Bf6# {I hope you enjoyed the game. I am really not sure what learning points I can emphasize here, except maybe these: 1. Bishop pair on e7 and e8 can together reinforce the kingside pawn structure while still having some influence on the queenside 2. The mating patterns that appeared in this game are very typical, and should be "seen" rather than calculated 3. If the oponent's best option is a mating attack - make sure it is not unstoppable before you make it his only option :) --- Thank you for looking over this game, I can answer any questions on private.
