1. e4 c5 2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Bc4 Nb6 5. Bb3 d5 6. d4 cxd4 7. cxd4 e6 8. Nf3 Bd7 {I would look for an opportunity to trade light-squared bishops} 9. O-O Bb5 {I doubt this is the most accurate move, but it at least puts my bad bishop on a more active square.} 10. Re1 Bb4 11. Nc3 Bc4 {Hoping to trade bishops and perhaps gain an outpost for my knight.} 12. Bd2 Nc6 {I decided to put pressure on d4 first before making any exchanges. There is possibility I may be able to draw the Queen away from the defense of the pawn by Bxb3 and also a possibility of Bxd2 drawing the Knight away from the defense winning me a central pawn.   I have found that the timing of exchanges is often very important. If you can postpone an exchange while creating threats, it is often beneficial to do so.} 13. Na4 {I imagine he might have been eyeing the possibility of 13. ... Nxa4  14. Bxa4 pinning my knight.} Bxb3 {Forcing either a potential defender away from d4 and d2 or doubling the b pawns.} 14. Qxb3 {Now the Knight on f3 is overworked defending both d2 and d4...} Bxd2 15. Nxd2 Nxd4 {Coming out of the exchange a pawn up. Also, I now have a passed pawn.} 16. Qg3 {Perhaps he didn't realize that his knight is left hanging...} O-O {Maybe I should have taken the knight immediately. However, I am already a pawn up and don't want to give him any counter attacking chances on my Kingside.} 17. Rac1 {He doesn't notice that his Knight is hanging...} Nxa4 18. b3 Nb6 19. Rc3 {Possibly planning to shift to the Kingside for a counter attack.} Nc6 20. a3 Nd7 21. Nf3 f6 {The pawn on e5 is what is holding his position together, so I challenge it. This does, of course, weaken my pawn on e6.} 22. exf6 Qxf6 23. Ng5 {Increasing pressure on e6} e5 {But I just push the pawn :)} 24. Qh4 {Threatening an obvious mate...} h6 {That is easily parried. But what else does he have?} 25. Nf3 e4 {I could have just traded Queens I guess, but I felt this gave my opponent more opportunity to make mistakes. } 26. Qxf6 Rxf6 27. Nd2 {He prepares to challenge my e pawn. } Re6 {I felt that a trade of pawns on e4 would be better for me than on f3. Looking at the position now, it probably have mattered little; however, sliding the Rook over to e6 does allow my Knight to take a supporting position at f6} 28. f3 Nf6 29. fxe4 Nxe4 30. Nxe4 Rxe4 {With Black's passed pawn and unchallenged Knight, White's position does not present much hope. White resigned here. Personally, I would not have resigned just in case my opponent made a blunder. }
