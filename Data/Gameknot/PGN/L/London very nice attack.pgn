1. d4 {A "new" Queen Gambit? :-)} d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bf4 Nf6 4. h3 e6 5. Nbd2 {Wrong move. White has to defend the d4 pawn here, with e3. Because the plan is to answer to black's Bd6 with Ne5, leaving the pawn unattended. This happened here, but...} Bd6 6. Ne5 {So, this was a simple blunder. A little one, of course, but a blunder. Nevertheless...} Nxd4 7. e3 Bxe5 {My plan to take in e5 with a pawn, one of the keys of this opening, fails... } 8. Bxe5 Nf5 {The simple Nf6 is better, but I cannot blame him for not seeing what was coming on...} 9. g4 {Again, Nh4 looks better, but g5 follows, and then the queen goes out... } Nd6 10. g5 {Where does this nasty pawn go?} Nfe4 {Ok, now I had to choose between h4, f4, or Nf3. Neither look bad... but I like to be aggressive, and after some calculation...} 11. Bxg7 Rg8 12. Bh6 Nxg5 {Never allow such a pin!} 13. Rg1 {Now it starts to be really tactic. One of the funniest variations I found was the following.   13. ...        Rg6 14. Qh5	Nd6-e4 15. o-o-o	Nxf2 16. Rxg5	Nxd1 17. Rxg6	h7xg6 18. Qe5	f7-f6 19. Qg3	Kf7 20. Bd3	f6-f5 21. Nf3	Qf6 22. Ne5+	Ke8 23. Bb5+	c7-c6 24. Nc6	Qb2+ 25. Kxd1	Qb5 26. Qxg6+	Kd7 27. Ne5+	Kc7 28. Qxf7+	Kd6 29. Bf4	Qb1+ 30. Kd2	Qb4+ 31. c2-c3	Qb2+ 32. Kd3	Qb1+ 33. Kd4	Qd1+ 34. Nd3+	Kc6 35. Qc7+	Kb5 36. Qc5+	Ka6 37. Qa3+	Kb6 38. Qb4+	Kc6 39. Qc5+	Kd7 40. Qc7+	Ke8 41. Bg5	Qa4+ 42. Ke5	Qe4+ 43. Kf6	Bd7 44. Ne5	Rd8 45. Qd6	and mate the next one, or black loses the queen. } Rg6 14. Qh5 {Here it goes, the dangerous queen. } Nde4 15. O-O-O {Risking again. A quiet way to play was to protect f2 (Rg2... looks weird), or h4 or f4... but I adore tactics, and if a sacrifice is possible, I do it. } Qf6 {Oh, playing hard... now I have to change my bishop, and all seems to stay calm, with a pawn less. Not quite. } 16. Bxg5 Nxg5 {A half blunder, since it allows my bishop to come into the game aggressively.} 17. Bd3 Rg7 18. f4 {This move makes me recover the pawn, but no only this. } Ne4 19. Nxe4 dxe4 20. Bxe4 {It opens the 5ยบ row to my queen's action, and bishop and rook are perfectly placed for a mortal attack. Black worry about his h pawn...} h6 21. Rxg7 Qxg7 22. Qb5+ {A mortal check, due to the combined action of my bishop and rook.} Ke7 23. Bxb7 {Qc4+ was also good. But this one is a little more sadistic, since it seems to give black some chances. } Rb8 24. Qc5+ {Ke8 is followed by Bc6+...} Kf6 25. Qe5+ {...and the game is over. Black can struggle more, and white can allow himself not to take the black's queen, with:   25. ... Ke7  26. Qc7+, Kf6  27. Qd8+, Kf5  28. e3-e4+, Kxf4  29. Rf1+, Ke5  30. Qc7+, Kd4  31. c2-c3+, Ke3  32. Qf4+, Kd3 33. Rf3+, Kc4 34. d5+, any,  35. Qb4#  Sure there are more defences for black, but the game is won if white just gets the black's queen. } Kg6 {The shortest way to lose, but... what else?  To say the truth: my opponent was trapped in a tactics difficult to see, and I got it by chance. One of those games in which a "little" mistake leads to major material loss. } 26. Rg1+ Kh7 27. Qxg7# {}
