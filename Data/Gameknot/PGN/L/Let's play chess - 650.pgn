1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Bb4 3. d3 {White normally plays a light-square game in this opening.} Bxc3+ 4. bxc3 {However, this tactical mistake by my opponent allows me to also control a crucial dark square and it opens a file for my QR.} Nf6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bh4 d6 {Both sides proceed with their development.} 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. e4 {Now I can use Q5 as an outpost, whereas Black cannot use his own Q5 for such a purpose. I may choose not to do so if the game dictates, but I retain the option.} O-O 9. d4 Qe8 10. Be2 Nxe4 {Oops. Well, at this level these things happen, and at this stage in the game a Pawn down isn't fatal.} 11. Qd3 Nef6 12. Bxf6 Nxf6 13. O-O {The opening is complete now: the middle game begins.} b6 14. Nd2 Bb7 15. f3 {Have to cut off the long diagonal and neutralize the Bishop.} exd4 16. cxd4 {This exchange seems kind of silly. It undoubles my Pawns and leaves me with a strong, flexible Pawn center.} Ba6 17. Ne4 d5 {Challenging my central Pawns.} 18. Nxf6+ gxf6 {Now his Pawn advantage is virtually neutralized because of his horrible K-side Pawn structure, if it comes to an endgame.} 19. f4 Bxc4 20. Qg3+ {I willingly have sacrificed a Pawn to get at his exposed King. I figure that if I don't generate a mating attack, i can at the least win back my material.} Kh8 21. Bxc4 dxc4 22. Rf3 Rg8 23. Qh4 {Intending at a minimum QxRP ch followed by QxBP, winning back my two Pawns.} Kh7 24. Qxf6 {Now planning R-R3 and QxRP mate.} Rg6 25. Qe5 Rc8 26. Rc1 Qg8 27. g3 {Stopping his counterattack. An endgame seems to be approaching.} f6 28. Qe7+ Qg7 29. Qxg7+ {With this exchange, a Rook endgame is is the works. The Black Pawn on his QB5 will fall and material will be even.} Rxg7 30. Rxc4 b5 31. Rc5 a6 {The preliminary maneuvers are over, and the position offers chances for both sides. To win a two-Rook ending with Pawns, one needs to keep one's own Rooks mobile and tie the other player's Rooks down to defending Pawns. I will try to utilize that strategy.} 32. Ra3 Rd7 {Attack and riposte.} 33. Rxa6 Rxd4 34. Rxf6 {In the first tactical skirmish, I win a Pawn and now have a protected passed KB pawn. Black's QB pawn is passed as well, and his best chance would seem to lie in advancing it or at least trying to tie down one of my Rooks to prevent its advance.} Kg7 35. Rfc6 b4 {A serious mistake, allowing me to remove Black's lone passed Pawn. The material and positional advantage gained should now decide the game in my favor.} 36. Rc6xc7+ Rxc7 37. Rxc7+ Kg6 {Now with both sides down to one Rook, I just have to remove the Black QNP and the win is technically easy.} 38. Rc2 Rd1+ 39. Kg2 Rb1 {Black attempts to keep the QNP on the board.} 40. Kf3 b3 {Another serious error. Either he didn't see the capture or he didn't realize the significance. But the game is now essentially over.} 41. axb3 Rxb3+ 42. Kg2 h5 {Now I need to remove the Rooks and win the easy King-and-Pawn ending.} 43. Rf2 Kf5 44. Rf3 {I try to draw him into exchanging Rooks.} Rb2+ {Not this time. But I see a haven for my King.} 45. Kh3 {Now there will be no more annoying checks.} Kg6 46. Re3 Rb6 47. Re5 {I try to maneuver my King and Rook to win the Black KRP.} Rb2 {Not just yet.} 48. Re3 Rb4 49. Kh4 {Now I have my King in position.} Rb5 50. Re5 {Offering again to exchange Rooks.} Rb7 51. Rxh5 {The KRP falls.} Rh7 {Throwing in the towel. After the exchange, it's all over but the shouting.} 52. Rxh7 Kxh7 53. Kg5 Kg7 {I just need to get one Pawn through. If I can get my King on the 7th rank, I can guard the Queening square of a Pawn.} 54. g4 Kf7 55. h4 Kg7 {Now I'll stall one more move and pass with my King when he loses the Opposition.} 56. h5 Kh7 57. Kf6 Kh6 {I need to wait again and drive his King to KR2, buying time to move my own King and KBP in position to Queen.} 58. Kf7 Kh7 59. f5 Kh6 {Now I can move my King out of the path of my KBP.} 60. Ke7 Kg5 61. f6 {The KNP and KRP will fall, but I only need 1 Queen.} Kxg4 62. f7 Kxh5 {Black has the consolation of gobbling a couple of Pawns.} 63. f8=Q {Black resigns.}
