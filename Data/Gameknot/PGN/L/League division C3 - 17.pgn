Qd2 g5 {White's h-pawn now has something to attack...} 10. O-O-O {! Black's king side pawns have been lured away from the castled king, leaving Black vulnerable to an early king side pawn storm. Moreover, Black's queen side is hopelessly underdeveloped, leaving White's king untroubled even after 0-0-0. Already Black is lost.} Nc6 11. h4 e5 12. hxg5 hxg5 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14.
