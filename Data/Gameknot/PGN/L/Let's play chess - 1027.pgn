[Opening "Sicilian (B70), dragon variation"]

1. e4 {This was a fairly ordinary Sicilian Dragon which developed into a long but quite interesting endgame win for black, and it is primarily for this that I have decided to annotate it.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {The Dragon, my main defence against 1.e4 if I am allowed to play it.} 6. Be2 {White opts for the classical variation rather than the Yugoslav Attack.} Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. Be3 Nc6 9. Qd2 Bd7 {Ng4 would also have been possible here, taking advantage of white's previous move and threatening to win the bishop pair.} 10. f3 {ruling out ...Ng4 and supporting his centre. This combination of f3 and Be2 has always seemed slightly illogical to me, though I often come up against it.} Rc8 11. Kh1 d5 {Taking advantage of white's relative lack of activity. There are various ways to deter this move, but none of them had been played. Part of the object was to expose f3 as a waste of time.} 12. exd5 Nb4 13. Nb3 {The exchanges here worked in my favour, though I wouln't say that I had calculated all the possible variations.} Bf5 14. Bd3 Bxd3 15. cxd3 {This isolated pawn will be the main theme of the early endgame.} Nbxd5 16. Nxd5 Nxd5 17. Bg1 {Preserving the counterweight to the dragon bishop. The duel between the two will be the other main theme of the endgame.} b6 18. Rac1 Qd6 {I don't mind exchanging rooks, but without conceding the c-file.} 19. Rxc8 Rxc8 20. Rd1 Nb4 21. a3 Nd5 {The knight returns, having provoked a slight weakness, to its central outpost.} 22. Rc1 {White decides to exchange the remaining pair of rooks, probably because he has a space disadvantage and is under a little pressure.} Rxc1 23. Qxc1 Qd7 24. d4 {The pawn is apparently well defended, but has moved to a bad square.} Qc7 {Happy to transpose into an endgame, given white's weak pawn.} 25. Qxc7 Nxc7 26. Be3 {Both sides try to activate their kings, and then we will see some king and knight manoeuvres centred on the d4 pawn.} e6 27. Kg1 Kf8 28. Kf1 Ke7 29. Ke2 Kd7 30. Kd3 Kc6 31. Nd2 {Aiming to redeploy on c3, preventing the black king from staying on d5.} Kd5 {In the meantime, though, that seems a good square.} 32. Nb1 Nb5 {Preempting white's move. The temporary absence of the white knight on its manoeuvres means that the pawn is threatened, and white's reply is forced.} 33. Nc3+ Nxc3 34. bxc3 {I have allowed white to un-isolate his d-pawn, but now proceed to fix his pawns on the wrong colour. This initiates the next stage of the endgame - the battle of the bishops.} b5 {With a clear advantage, I think, despite the material parity.} 35. Bf4 Bf8 {Forcing the white bishop back, into a position where it is in danger of running out of room.} 36. Bc1 Bd6 {Black's strategy is now to probe on the king's side, while keeping the white bishop tied to the a3-c1 diagonal.} 37. h3 Bg3 {To stop the advance of white's pawns, depriving white of tempi. Black's aim is to induce Bb2, occupy the c1-h6 diagonal, forcing Ba1. This direct appoach, however, is rebuffed.} 38. Be3 {No longer pinned down to the defence of a3, white keeps the important diagonal.} Bd6 {...so we try again.} 39. Bc1 Be7 40. Bb2 a6 {The immediate Bb4 can be blocked by white's kingside pawns. I want the bishop back on d6, and this pawn move is primarily to remove the danger of a threefold repetition.} 41. Bc1 {White's bishop no longer has any moves, and he is virtually forced to make kingside pawn moves. Black plans to induce the pawns onto black squares, at the same time using up white's spare tempi.} Bd6 42. f4 h5 {A cramping move to limit white's options.} 43. h4 {Otherwise ...h4 and white is in zugzwang. White's bishop would take too long to get over to the weakened h-pawn.} Be7 44. g3 Bd6 {The bishop comes back to base, having done its job on the kingside. Now white must take the bishop off the c1-h6 diagonal, and in its absence black will break the position open to get at the weakened white pawns.} 45. Bb2 f6 46. a4 {An interesting break, but too late; black now has other targets, and can allow the white a-pawn, having served as a target for so long, to exchange itself off. If this move had been played earlier, then recapturing it would have posed a dilemma.} e5 {Black continues with his plan.} 47. axb5 axb5 {Keeping the c-pawn fixed.} 48. Bc1 {This variation ends up losing, but the alternative, exchanging on e5, would bring the black bishop to e5 winning the g-pawn.} exd4 {Securing the outside passed pawn, so that the pawn ending would be won.} 49. cxd4 Bb4 {The bishop now has space to penetrate behind white's position. Obviously he is heading for e1, and white cannot afford to exchange bishops.} 50. f5 {I thought the alternative last-ditch sacrifice, g4, looked more interesting, but I had analyzed that too as a win.} gxf5 {Black still has the multiple threats of ...Be1 and ...Bd6.} 51. Bf4 {A last attempt to defend the g-pawn.} Bd6 {And 0-1. White cannot exchange bishops, and any other move would lose the g and h pawns.}
