[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D00)"]

1. d4 {Hi, welcome to my second game annotation. I'm not a pro player and I often play intuitively or even shortsighted. So you probably won't see any big schemes played out.} d5 {I don't like the queen's pawn opening as much as the "classic" king's pawn, but I got used to it a little by now since it seems to be popular, at least against me. ;)} 2. h3 {Pretty defensive move at this point, I got nothing out, against what is he defending right now?} c5 {So I turn around the routine of trying to get the pawn out of the centre.} 3. Nf3 c4 {He didn't want and I didn't want a double pawn so I just stepped forward. It opens up a nice line for my black bishop.} 4. Bf4 Nf6 5. b3 b5 6. e3 e6 {By now I thought I stood pretty nicely, solid pawn line, only very little figures out.} 7. a3 Bd6 {So time to get them out aggressively.} 8. Nc3 Ba6 9. Bxd6 Qxd6 10. Be2 Nbd7 {Now I was able to do both rochades, which I like, because I like to think that my opponent doesn't know as to what side to concentrate on. Obviously the king's side is more attractive, so I probably fooled no one here.} 11. O-O e5 {But first let's clear up the centre a little.} 12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Re1 O-O 14. bxc4 bxc4 15. Nd4 Ne4 16. Nxe4 dxe4 {This was probably not so good for me, since I have two helpless baby pawns that I have to take care for} 17. c3 Rab8 {An open line? I like that.} 18. Qc2 {And here goes the pawn attack.} f5 {Had to rip up my kings castle.} 19. Red1 {He didn't like my queen there I think.} Qh6 {So I went on the king's side, because that's where the party would be. } 20. Rab1 {Now he wants the line too....} Rxb1 {So I exchanged...in hindsight maybe not that smart.} 21. Rxb1 {because now it's his line. And he'll use it.} Bc8 {I wanted to get the white bishop to the king's side too, but that was a bad position as we'll see.} 22. Qa4 {He goes at it.} a6 {what else could I do? Little did I know, but this pawn would be my win.} 23. Bxc4+ {That hurt, because after ...Nxc4 Qc4  I would feel very uncomfortable.} Kh8 {So I went into defensive right away. Too bad that I couldn't open the castle with the h pawn because of the queen, it would have saved me a lot of trouble.} 24. Bd5 f4 {I think I wanted to put my rook on the f line to use and tried opening it up.} 25. exf4 Rxf4 {which worked.} 26. Rb8 {Very good move. He practically bound my Bishop and an there was an immediate mate.} Rf8 {So I had to move back to defend my king, but it was getting dangerous now.} 27. Bxe4 {There went the other pawn.} Qg5 {Baaaaaad move. I had to make way for the h pawn, and maybe I dreamed of Nf3 if both his knight and bishop would miraculously disappear, but after 28. Ne6 I would either lose my rook, or after ...Bxe6 29. Rxf8  .} 28. Qb4 {But uuuuh, he missed it. But that's the game for not so experienced players, we win if the other one makes mistakes that we see and we lose if we make mistakes the other one sees.} Qc1+ {I don't remember how I got that move, but this really turned around the game. Or more specifically, it turned it from a one side danger to a thriller for both of us.} 29. Kh2 {No other possibility there.} Qf4+ {I continued to attack him, with my rook, bishop and knight I really saw some possibilities here. I only would have to take care not to get a cheap mate by forgetting about my bad king position.} 30. g3 {Only other way except going down again, and he probably wanted to win so he didn't want a threefold repitition.} Qxf2+ {But now it got very interesting.} 31. Bg2 Nd3 {I needed a bigger army for that so I moved my horse and nicely attacked his queen at the same time, so I wouldn't lose a tempo.} 32. Qc4 Ne1 {Of course ...Qxg2   was right at the door.} 33. Qc6 {But he saw it and cleverly used his queen.} Nxg2 {I saw no other chance but to burn some material.} 34. Qxg2 Qxg2+ 35. Kxg2 {And here I got struck by luck again and saw the possibilities.} Bxh3+ {I sacrificed my bishop to get his rook.} 36. Kxh3 Rxb8 {From here it was just a matter of staying disciplined and watching out for that horrible knight of his.} 37. Kg4 Rc8 38. Ne2 Rc5 {First I drew a line for all white figures. I didn't want one white figure in my half.} 39. Kf4 {Here we can already see that there's really nothing he could do anymore but wait for a mistake made by me.} h6 {Off we go.} 40. Ke3 g5 41. Kd4 Ra5 42. Kc4 Re5 43. Kd3 Kg7 {Of course the king was needed now to help get a pawn through.} 44. c4 Kf6 45. Nd4 g4 46. Nc6 Rh5 47. Ke4 a5 48. a4 Ke6 49. Kf4 Rc5 {I liked this move. The white king was lured away by the g pawn and so I could attack both his c pawn and the knight. One of them would have to go.} 50. Nd4+ {Obviously he chose the pawn to go.} Kf6 51. Ke3 {To late, dear white king, your c pawn is history. And somehow I sensed that the a pawn wouldn't have long to live either.} Rxc4 52. Ne2 Rxa4 {I knew it.} 53. Nf4 Kg5 54. Ne6+ Kf5 55. Nc5 Rc4 56. Nb7 Re4+ 57. Kf2 {He could have given up by now, but I don't know if I would have...Against a >1300 maybe, but there's always a chance of THE big mistake, like right there, if I say did  a4? now, 58. Nd6 ! might have turned around the game or at least given him the draw.} Ra4 {But no way.} 58. Nd6+ Ke5 59. Nf7+ Ke4 60. Nxh6 {I put all my money on the a pawn now, the others were just distraction.} Ra2+ 61. Kg1 {This is where I like my kings.} Kf3 62. Nf5 a4 {Finish line was already visible.} 63. Kh1 a3 64. Kg1 Rb2 65. Kh1 a2 66. Kg1 a1=R# {And that was it. A fine game with some great and suspense moments.}
