1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.} 3. Nc3 {This is a variation I'm not particularly familiar with in the Latvian, standard are 3. Nxe5 or 3. Bc4. Black's main responses here are 4...fxe4 5. Nxe5 Qf6, which can transpose back into the main line after 6. Nc4, or 3. Nf6 4. Bc4 fxe4 5. Nxe5 d5 6. Nxd5 Nxd5 7. Qh5+.} d6 {...But I opt for this move, which transposes instead to the Philidor Counter-Gambit, a line favored by Paul Morphy.} 4. d4 {We have arrived at the Philidor Counter-Gambit; this position would normally be reached via 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 f5?! 4. Nc3.} fxe4 {This can lead to 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Neg5, which is fairly strong for White (though Jim West has suggested that 6...exd4 7. Nxd4 Qe7+ gives Black good chances). Perhaps better is 4...exd4. } 5. Nxe4 d5 {Black continues his aggression.} 6. Nxe5 {This is not a true sacrifice, merely baiting Black's pawn to an extended, isolated spot on e5. White can win the material back after 6...dxe4 7. Qh5+ g6 8. Nxg6.} dxe4 {Declining White's sacrifice would be somewhat ungentlemanly. } 7. Qh5+ g6 8. Nxg6 Nf6 {This is somewhat stronger than 8...hxg6 9. Qxh8 Nf6.} 9. Qe5+ Kf7 {The only reasonable move. For an opening Black chose, his position is not looking so good. He must be extremely careful now that he doesn't get his King trapped by White's pieces.} 10. Nxh8+ Kg8 11. Bg5 {White pins the Knight, threatening either Qxe4 or Bxf6 and the deadly attack will continue.} Be7 {11...Bg7 would put the Bishop in a more comfortable location, but allows an immediate 12. Qxe4. Black is also dearly hoping to be able to develop his Nb8 with tempo by attacking the WQ, but the initiative is still firmly in White's grasp.} 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Qxe4 Kxh8 {White's attack has run out of steam for now, though Black is behind in material, underdeveloped, and must be wary of Bd3 followed by Qxh8#.} 14. O-O-O {White gets his King to safety and reinforces the d-pawn. Black needs to develop his pieces, but the powerful WQ in the center of the board severely limits his choices.} Nc6 {Allowing the Bc8 to move without endangering the b-pawn.} 15. Bd3 {White develops with a critical threat. Another option here was 15. d5, forcing the Black Knight to move again and cramping the Black position further with control of e6.} Qg8 {This seems the only sensible way to defend h7. Black is two pawns down, and can't very well afford to trade off his Queen on e7.} 16. h3 {?! White makes plans to storm the pitiful Black castle, while preparing to further restrict Black's LSB's range with g2-g4. 16. d5 might have been more reliable, denying Black the e6 square and getting the d-pawn out of immediate danger.} Be6 {Black develops while defending against d4-d5 and threatens to grab a free pawn on the queenside. 16...Nxe4 or 16...Bxe4 are probably also possible here, but if Black wants to stand a chance, he needs to get his pieces mobilized as soon as possible.} 17. c4 {? This is either an oversight, or a tactic too deep for me to see the purpose. The Black Bishop is drawn in momentarily, allowing White to repel it while defending his remaining queenside pawns, but it seems to me that 17. b3 followed by 18. c4 would be stronger. Alternately, 17. Rhe1 would be a solid developing move, giving White control of the e-file.} Bxc4 {This pawn is free; if White exchanges, Black takes back with check and subsequently wins the d-pawn as well.} 18. b3 {Shoring up those last two pawns. White's castle is looking messy, but luckily Black has no way in (...Bg5+ is handily refuted by f2-f4) and still has to contend with the threat of mate on h7.} Bd5 {Black retreats his Bishop with tempo, promising to win more pawns as he stares down at g2.} 19. Qf5 {This is one of surprisingly few safe locations for the WQ. White forces the Black Bishop to move, setting up a mild attempt to win it on d4, while critically keeping the pressure on h7. 19. Qf4 might be stronger, letting White keep his material advantage and tying down another Black piece after 19...Bxd4 20. Qxc7 Rb8 21. Rhe1.} Bxd4 {Black threatens various pawns around the board and has finally equalized his material, but his minor pieces are somewhat vulnerable to counterattack in their tenuous circle of protection.} 20. Bb5 {?! White threatens to win one of Black's minor pieces, but the threat is easily parried, and this move by White frees the BQ momentarily from her defense of h7. See my note to White's move 19.} Rf8 {Black brings up his final piece to complete his development with tempo, driving away the White Queen from her powerful center post and looking hungrily at White's second rank.} 21. Qh5 {The White Queen maintains pressure on h7 and d5. This is a stronger choice than 21. Qd7? as the latter does not prevent Black from beginning a dangerous attack of his own with ...Qg5+.} Rxf2 {Black threatens 22...Bb2+ and related violence, which could be fatal if White plays carelessly: 22. Rhf1?? Bb2+ 23. Kb1 Be4+ 24. Bd3 Bxd3+ 25. Rxd3 Rxf1+ 26. Kxb2 Qxg2+ and Black has an easy win.} 22. Bxc6 {?? White's best shot at living through Black's attack here was probably 22. Rdf1, giving his King some breathing room on d1. After 22...Rxa2 23. Bd3 White stands a chance of staving off Black's ravening pieces long enough to find a perpetual check. With 22. Bxc6, however, White dooms himself to a painful death. After 22...Bb2+ 23. Kb1 Bxc6 24. Rd3 Be4 25. Rhd1 Qe6 White cannot prevent the Black Queen from entering the fight decisively, via c6, g6 or e1: 26. Qc5 (to prevent ...Qc6 followed by ...Qc2#) ...Bxd3+ 27. Rxd3 Qe1+ 28. Qc1 Qxc1#, or 26. Qg4 Bf5 27. Qh5 Bxd3+ 28. Rxd3 Qe4 29. Qd1 Re2 and whatever White plays now, Black would have to blunder horrifically to lose the resulting Q vs R endgame. Best would probably be 26. Qb5 a6 27. Qc4 Qxc4 28. bxc4 Rxg2 and the LSB ties down White's Rooks while Black butchers all the pawns on the map.} Bb2+ {The Gameknot computer analysis alternately suggests 22...Qg3 or 22...Qe6, aiming for the weak e3 square.} 23. Kb1 {Forced.} Bxc6 {Now Black threatens ...Be4+ and mate in one.} 24. Qh4 {? White holds out longer with 24. Rd3; see my note to White's twenty-second move. Possibly he was baited by the chance at a royal pin with Rd8, but it's irrelevant now--Black has a mate in three available to him.} Qg6+ {White is done for (25. Qe4 Qxe4+ 26. Rd3 Qxd3#), and he resigns. Black's superior development and open space proved adequate to win back the gambited material and secure victory from all the way across the board.
