1. e4 {I play white, Slowracer plays black} e5 {kings pawn opening.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {standard} 3. Bc4 Bc5 {not so standard. i am not used to this as white, although employ it fairly often as black.} 4. c3 {i decided to play differently to how I normally do, and advanced with the intention of d4 next move.} a6 5. d4 {battle for centre begins!} exd4 6. cxd4 {i am in a strong position now with the bishop having to retreat.} Ba7 {now i saw the reason for a6. A good move by black.} 7. O-O d6 {I protect my king while black develops} 8. Nc3 b5 {i develop knight while black attempts to push back my bishop} 9. Bd5 {THis was the first move i was proud of in this game.  Pinning the knight to the rook. Blacks nxt move ties up 4 of his major pieces on his Queen side} Bb7 {Black has 4 pieces King side, all effectively tied up the pawn structure and my white bishop.} 10. Ng5 {How can he defend it I thought.} Nh6 {Good move by black, but it puts yet another piece in a less than ideal position.} 11. Qf3 {upping the pressure. Black now begins to mount a valient defence, while I mount a conveluted attack!} O-O 12. Qg3 {after black castles I move my Queen over, hoping for something like 13: nxh7, kxh7. 14: bxh6  leaving his pawn structure very week.} Qf6 {Black builds up his defence.} 13. Re1 {I move my rook out for extra pressure. It will take a couple of moves but what can black do with his half his pieces on the other side of the board?} Rab8 {Black here is trying to free up his pieces. If do not take the knight he can play nxd4, freeing up his white squared bishop and putting his knight on the valuable d4.} 14. Bxc6 Bxc6 {Good exchange for black.} 15. Re3 {I continue to develop rook} Bxd4 {Was not sure if Black had an overall game plan here.} 16. Rf3 {attacking the Q} Qe5 17. Rf4 {Blocking the queens attack on my Queen.} Qe7 {Queen retreats.} 18. Rh4 Be5 {swing my rook over and black attacks my queen again.} 19. f4 {i block with pawn} Bxc3 {I think this was one of blacks poorer moves.} 20. bxc3 Bxe4 {Black wins a pawn. I start to get nervous about the exposure of my king!} 21. Rxh6 {Rxh6!! Should have done it 3 moves ago, but i didnt see it. I knew there was an attack somewhere but just saw it.} gxh6 {Black takes, and loses the game with...} 22. Ne6+ {must lose to checkmate or lose the Queen.} Kh8 {Black chooses checkmate. I thoroughly enjoyed the game:D} 23. Qg7# {Checkmate}
