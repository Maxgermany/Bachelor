1. d4 {Time controls were 60minutes plus 30seconds per move} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {Kings Indian defence, black will look to quickly get the king castled then see where they will later seek play} 4. e4 {Taking up the centre with a large 'classical' sort of set up} d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {Black will need to strike at whites large pawn centre, and has the option of either doing so with the c pawn to indicate queen side play or else with the e pawn which is indicative of king side play} e5 {I think this is the more commons pawn break and indicates that black probably wants to attack on the king side } 7. O-O {I think d5 used to be the go however these days castles is considered more accurate, with the idea that black must first make some sort of concession before white clarity's the situation in the centre for example if Re8 now then white plays d5 and the rook is misplaced since the closing of the centre means the rook really belongs on f8. In short castling is the more flexible option and strong players love to play flexibly  } Nc6 8. d5 {Now white closes the centre whilst hitting the knight. And now that the centre has been closed up play will now take place on the wings. White will attack on the queen side whereas black will attack on the kingside which is where he has the most space } Ne7 9. Ne1 {White will put most of his energy into getting in the c5 break and this move plans to bring the knight to d3 where he can assist in facilitating that pawn break, also from d3 the knight can in some cases come back to f2 to slow down blacks pawn storm. Another option is to play Nd2 and look to get in c5 followed by exchanging on d3 and then brining the knight to c4 to grind at d6 } Ne8 {Blacks pawn break is f5 so the knight gets out of the way so that the f pawn can advance} 10. b4 f5 11. f3 Nf6 {The f pawn has now moved forward and the knight was not assisting anything on the back rank so he jumps back to f6} 12. c5 {White has to get this break in at some point or else risk being completely run over on the king side, I decide that I may as well break sooner rather than later. When both sides are attacking on opposite wings it becomes essential that both party's go after there goals with as much speed and energy as possible since reacting to the opponents threats will mean the defending side will quickly go down hill} f4 {Black gains more space on the kingside where he is attacking and prepares for the forthcoming attack, the next pawn break that black will want to get in is g4 since his most advanced pawn is on f4} 13. Nd3 g5 14. a4 {Both sides are still gaining as much space as they can on their sectors of the boards} Ng6 15. Ba3 {My bishop was not doing much on c1 and I wanted to be in a position to play b5 and have the ability to potentially make a recapture on c5 with something other than my knight so that he would still be free to drop back to f2 if needed} Rf7 16. b5 {Still gaining space} h5 {And black does likewise} 17. h3 {Black was ready to get in ...g4 so I put a stop to that} Bf8 18. c6 {I probably was still going to play this however ...Bf8 encouraged me that it was the right thing to do} Rg7 {Black should play ...b6} 19. Nf2 {!? This was done so that it would be harder for black to get in ...g4 however I should have jumped on the chance to exchange on b7 where after black recaptures, he must waste time brining his bishop back into play on the kingside and in the meantime white would look to bring a knight to the c6 square and possibly a rook to the c file and I think white has more than enough play on the queenside to distract black from his play on the kingside } Rb8 {?! Black still should have played ...b6, this just wastes times as the rook will belong on the a file} 20. Na2 {?! I still should have exchanged on b7 and gone with the same plan of brining a knight to c6. By doing it in this move order I allow black to put a stop to my counter play on the queenside} b6 {Black finally wakes up and snuffs out most of whites queenside play. Now although white will probably have good chances in an endgame, black now has a free hand on the kingside to attack since whites queenside play isn't dangerous enough to distract black from matters on the kingside} 21. a5 {I need to open files on the queenside and this is the only way to do it} Nh4 22. axb6 {? This will need to be played at some point if white plans to have any chances, however I should have allowed my rook to see along the a file first. Now black wins the a file shutting out any chances white had since most of the game will now be played on the kingside where black is obviously much better. White has to reach an endgame now if there is any hope, a queen exchange will be very helpful to white} axb6 23. Nc3 Ra8 {Eugh without a queenside rook whites extra queenside space will be meaningless. The game is over on the queenside and now black can concentrate everything he has on the kingside, though on the flip side white can also devote everything he has to the defence of the kingside } 24. Kh2 {I wasn't sure how to really improve my position and thought I might try and let my f1 rook defend better by moving to g1, or perhaps even coming to h1 in order to let my king escape to the centre/queenside. It may have been best however to have allowed the exchange of queenside rooks so that I only have one wing to worry about. But it's hard to make such a move when it simply admits that something has gone seriously wrong with whites plan} g4 {At last} 25. hxg4 {This as it turns out is actually a mistake, it was correct to capture with the f pawn. It never occurred to me or my opponent either during the game or in the post game analysis session we had that capturing away from the centre would be incorrect however it turns out there are tactics based on ...Nxf3! However looking at it now it does seem like fxg4 ought to have preferred anyway} hxg4 26. Nxg4 {Again this is the wrong recapture because of ...Nxf3} Nxg4+ 27. fxg4 Qg5 28. Rf2 Ng6 29. Kg1 Qh4 {Naturally I was quite worried here as it is clear blacks in control} 30. Rf3 {I would have liked to bring my rook to h3 but I didn't notice that the bishop was about to be covering that square. But at the same time I was concerned about being killed on the h file, incidentally it never occurred to me that my rook could come to f1 in the event of danger along the h file since once the queen moves the f2 square would act as an escape route for my king. So possibly I should have used this time to do something with my queenside pieces by either allowing the trade of rooks or reorganising the pieces with Ra2,Nb1 ect allowing my other rook to act as a defender. The main problem for white is that with no active play in any sector of the board, black has all the time in the world organise his pieces for a breakthrough on the kingside } Bxg4 31. Rd3 Bc8 32. Rf3 {This was actually as a result of the touch move rule, for whatever reason I didn't notice that the bishop was covering h3 and I grabbed my rook ready to play Rh3 but suddenly realised that it couldn't be played so I had to move the rook} Qg5 33. Rf2 Nh4 34. Bf3 Nxf3+ 35. Qxf3 Bg4 36. Qd3 f3 37. Kf1 Rxa3 {This allows black to exchange into a winning endgame. I should also point out my opponent has been very low on time for the past few moves and as a result may have easily missed something decisive.} 38. Rxa3 Qc1+ 39. Nd1 {Blocking the check and also protecting the rook } fxg2+ 40. Rxg2 Qxd1+ {?? Luckily for me my opponent had about 9 seconds left at this point and panicked taking with the first piece that came to hand, but this exchanges into a clearly lost endgames, it was essential for black to keep queens on. Correct was 40...Bxd1 41.Rxg7+ Bxg7 and by keeping the queens on the ending is almost certainly winning for black. Though still quite interesting } 41. Qxd1 Bxd1 42. Rxg7+ Bxg7 {Now because of the weakness on c7, white wins easily} 43. Ra7 Bb3 44. Rxc7 Bc4+ 45. Kf2 Bxb5 46. Rb7 Bh6 47. Rxb6 Ba4 48. c7 {I've improved a lot since I played in this tournament last year and my rating was only 1000 or so as well. I might annotate a couple of other games from this tournament as well so look out for more. Hope you enjoyed this instructive though albeit lucky encounter between me and a strong opponent and although there were probably a couple of things both sides missed, it was an over the board encounter and accurate calculation in complex positions can be quite difficult especially with the time factor as well}
