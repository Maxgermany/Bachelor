1. d4 {In this tight game, both made bad mistakes but the situation seemed to me interresting, so that I decided to make anotation public.} d6 2. e4 {logical and agressive} g6 {preparing fiancheto} 3. Nc3 c6 4. Be3 Nf6 {all in books up to now} 5. h3 {to prevent a further Bg4 or Ng4} Bg7 {fianchetoing the bishop} 6. g4 {preparing a pawn storm, as black will probably castle kingside but weakening white's right wing. But it seriously weakens the king if white opts for short castling.} O-O 7. Bg2 {2 pawns on d4 and e4, to occupy the center is strong but easy to attack for black, they have to be protected.} e5 {Here comes the attack, maybe to soon (black has a knight and a bishop still in their garage)} 8. Nge2 {reinforcing the center and developing} exd4 9. Nxd4 {An outposted knight which won't stay long here} d5 {launching a trading sequence} 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 cxd5 {OK, the trade is over ! White's knight can hardly be fired. White has developpement advance but has not castled and his king is weak.} 12. c3 {to reinforce the knight and, more important, to avoid him to move by interposing between the b2 pawn and the fianchetoed bishop} Nc6 13. Nxc6 {Maybe a mistake Nb3 might ahve been better} bxc6 {This reinforces the black central pawn} 14. O-O {Mistake, the first idea of white was to castle long but after 12. c3 I thought it was a bad plan} f5 {Black has the initiative. This move weakens the black king but with the pawns on d5 and c6, black prevents white attack by the a6 f1 diagonal.} 15. f3 {Doubtfull move, it weakens the king, blocks the g2 bishop and the DSB is no longer protected.} Re8 {Obvious move.} 16. Re1 {Blunder ! Bf2 would have been better. Re1 was playable later to challenge the open file.} Rxe3 {Uh uh !} 17. Rxe3 {Dangerous situation for white} Qb6 {pinning the white rook} 18. Qe1 {protecting the rook} Bh6 {the poor rook is under strong attack} 19. Kh1 {Off the queen's fireline } Bxe3 {Obvious move} 20. b4 {White tries to annoy black by opening lines for his pieces and limiting black's possibilities} f4 {Black reinforces his position. Why should he hurry} 21. a4 {White need space} a5 {Good counter} 22. Rb1 {menacing the black queen} axb4 23. Rxb4 {The black king is isolated. If black doesn't pay enough attention, some counter may be possible.} Qa7 24. Bf1 {setting the bishop in an open diagonal, to give it mobility} c5 {One option for black is indeed to get a passed pawn and bring it to promotion, which would force white to sacrifice queen or rook.} 25. Rb5 {Not much choice. It offers the a4 pawn whichh is anyway condemned} Qxa4 26. c4 {Openning a diagonal for the queen (looking for material euality in the exchanges has little point now. All that white can expect is an opportunity to launch a raid toward the black king. More chances to have this opportunity if white's pieces are more mobile. The c4 square is interresting, for, frm there the LSB could menace the king} dxc4 27. Rb6 {The white rook is very mobile now} Ba6 28. Qb1 {Now white has a possibility to force a draw. Will black see it ?} Re8 {Blunder, Ra7 would have been better.} 29. Rxg6+ {rook sacrifice } hxg6 {Black takes ! 29.... Kf8 would have been better.} 30. Qxg6+ {The game is over !} Kh8 31. Qh6+ Kg8 32. Qg6+ Kh8 {Black offers a draw, which white is happy to accept !}
