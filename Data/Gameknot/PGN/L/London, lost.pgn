1. d4 {I miscalculated the situation. I broke my own plan, because I had not seen all its consecuences.} d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. e3 e6 5. c3 Bd6 6. Ne5 Nge7 7. g4 Bxe5 8. dxe5 Bg6 9. h4 Qd7 10. Nd2 h5 11. f3 O-O-O 12. Qa4 {Now is the time to see if he likes tactics. I am doing this move by purpose, and he picked (but I still don't know who is good for, and the game seems to say that I have some bizarre chance. } Nxe5 {So he's playing tactically...} 13. Qxa7 {and me too. I must, now. } Ne5c6 14. Qa8+ {I have to justify my queen's "decoy". I didn't see the weakness of my e3, after e5 (before or after f6). } Nb8 {The only way to justify such thing is a stunning pawn attack over the queenside. But it takes too long to perform.} 15. Nb3 {I took the wrong way, here. a4, and pry to come in time to a6. } Qc6 16. Nd4 Qb6 {Now I blundered, and moved the knight to b5, thinking that it is nice the a7 check, as if it was all can matter... and I lost.   But I have a chance. A very slight chance.  17. b3, f6.  18. a4, and if e5,  19. a5, Qd6 (the only square) 20. a6! threatening Qxb7+ and Bb5, then a7 aimng to a8 (not to the knight). For example:  20. ..., e5xB 21. Qxb7+, Kd7 (forced) 22. a7, Nc6,  23. Nb5, and I think am winning.  or 22. ..., f4xe3!,  23. Rh3, Qc4,  24. a8=Q, Qg3 25. Kd1, Qf2,  26. Ra2, and I think black runs out of steam.  But I didn't see all this, so I lost...} 17. Nb5 e5 18. Bxe5 Qxe3+ 19. Kd1 Qxe5 20. Qa4 Nec6 21. f4 Qe3 22. Be2 Rde8 23. Re1 Bd3 24. Nd4 Nxd4 25. Qxd4 Bxe2+ 26. Kc2 Qxd4 27. cxd4 Bxg4 28. Re5 c6 29.
