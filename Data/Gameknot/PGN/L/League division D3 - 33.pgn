1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bd6 {I'm unfamiliar with 2. Bd6 so it was quickly into the unknown for me} 3. Bc4 Qe7 {3. Qe7 is deeper into new territory for me} 4. Nc3 {I'm just developing normally here} Nf6 5. O-O Nc6 6. d3 a6 {I'm not sure the purpose of this move. I'm not really inclined to place my Knight or Bishop on the b5 square as the king is ready to castle} 7. Nd5 {My pieces are largely developed and I thought my opponent was in a cramped position so started moving forward with aggression} Qd8 {7. ... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb4 9. a3 traps the Knight. 7. ... Nxd5 8. exd5 Na5 9. a3 b5 10. b4 Nb7 and the Knight escapes. White can also capture with the Bishop. 7. ... Nxd5 8. Bxd5 Nb4 is pretty good for black I think} 8. Bg5 {Pinning the Knight so it can't capture and leaving my Knight on d5 in a very strong position. The black Queen is also in very cramped quarters} Bc5 9. Nxf6+ {I thought wrecking the King side position was worth the trade as Black is still a distance from a long side Castle. I do lose that beautifully positioned Knight.} gxf6 10. Bh6 {I love this short little diagonal for the Bishop} d6 {Trying to get more pieces into the game and set up for a long side castle} 11. Nh4 {I wanted to free up my Queen for penetration along the King side and was also peeking the f5 square} Qe7 12. c3 {I don't like the idea of Black putting the Bishop or Knight on the d4 square and this also gives my Queen a path to the Queen side in case black successfully long side castles} Be6 13. Bxe6 {Retreating is not really an option and I'm forced to trade off my light squared Bishop} fxe6 {13. ... Qxe6 14. Nf5 0-0-0 looks better for black to me although it does allow my knight into that f5 square} 14. Qh5+ {Preventing the long side castle makes all my pieces on the King side much more dangerous} Kd7 {14. ... Qf7 15. Qxf7 Kxf7 looks better for black to me} 15. Kh1 {With any hope of getting the black King to safety gone, I now need one more attacking piece and the f pawn followed by the Rook on the f column is the plan here} Rhg8 {Setting up for a King side attack down the g file. This was a threat I took very seriously} 16. f4 Be3 17. f5 Rae8 {This was the blunder that won me the game. 17. ... Bxh6 18. Qxh6 and then starting to line up the Rooks on the King side seems strong to me although my Knight pinched up against the edge of the board has some potential attacks and defends nicely as well} 18. Bxe3 Kc8 {Getting the King to safety} 19. b4 {I want to get my queen side attack rolling as quickly as possible as I'm eyeing that open g file nervously} Qd7 20. a4 Re7 {Moving into position to attack along the g file} 21. fxe6 {I thought this delayed the attack slightly but also opened the f5 square to my knight. The game continuation suggests this was a very good move for me} Qxe6 22. b5 {Rolling rolling rolling} Na5 {22. ... axb5 23. axb5 Nd8 is not good for black but I'm not sure this is so great either} 23. bxa6 Reg7 {Black now martials his forces for the attack I think hoping for 24. axb7 Nxb7} 24. a7 {This move won the game for me. The forward a pawn is a square away from promotion and black is forced into fully defensive posture from here on out} Kd7 {Anything else results in promotion for my a pawn} 25. Nf5 {Now my Knight comes devastatingly into the f5 square with many opportunities} Rg7g6 {25. ... Rf7 26. Nh6 forks the Rooks} 26. Qxh7+ Kc6 27. Ne7+ Kd7 {I missed the mating combination here momentarily and went for material} 28. Nxg8+ Kc6 29. Ne7+ {Now I see the Mating Combination and move on it} Kd7 30. Nd5+ Kc6 {30. ... Kc8 31. a8=R# or 30. Kd8 31. a8=R+ Qc8 32. Qe7#} 31. Nb4# {I thought this was an elegant mate but I wish I had spotted it when Black's other Rook was still on the board. I thought Black wasted a bit of time in the opening but the blunder of losing the Bishop and overlooking 24. a7 ended the game quickly}
