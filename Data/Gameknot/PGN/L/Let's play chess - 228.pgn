1. e4 {For sometime now, favoured opening.....} e5 {Normal reply !} 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 h6 4. c3 c6 5. Nf3 b5 {Interesting, pushing the white bishop back....} 6. Bb3 a5 7. a3 a4 8. Ba2 {Nothing square for the white bishop. In saying that once the pawns move forward, you've left holes, is that a weakness. Then again my opponent is on the move.......Gotta say too, I'm no fan of a long diagonal of pawns, for a few reasons.....} Ng4 {Kg4 ! Red herring, food for thought.....} 9. h3 {Don't like it so get away !!} Nf6 10. Be3 d6 11. b3 axb3 12. Bxb3 {White Bishop cant stay where, this also free's Rook.} Na6 13.
