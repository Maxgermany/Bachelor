[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Lipnitzky attack"]

1. e4 {e4. A standard choice for me which I tend to do better with thn d4.} c5 {Black opts for the Sicilian. A solid choice against e4 which statistically has the best results for wins and draws.} 2. Nf3 {Standard developing move which controls d4 and d5.} d6 {Protecting the pawn and e5.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Clearly the Najdorf Sicilian which works well for black by creating opportunities on the Queen side.} 6. Bc4 {Eying off the vulnerable e7 square.} Qc7 {Attacking the bishop while developing the Queen to a useful square.} 7. Bb3 {Retreating the bishop while maintaining pressure on the e7 square.} b5 {This Queen side pawn push starts an early attack for white while freeing up the b7 square for the light square bishop. } 8. Be3 {Developing the dark square bishop and protecting the knight on d4. If black continues to push his b pawn then I anticipated Nd5. The alternative move I considered was f3, keeping blacks Knight off of g4.} b4 {As anticipated...} 9. Nd5 {Nd4 attacking the Queen and anticipating and exchange of Knights.} Nxd5 10. Bxd5 Bb7 11. Qf3 {Rather than exchange bishops on the d7 square I wanted to maintain development and move toward castling but at this stage not sure which side. I was a bit concerned about the Queenside pawns so will probably castle king side. } e5 {Protecting the pawn on f7 with blacks Queen while attacking the knight on d4.} 12. Bxb7 Qxb7 {Trading off bishops.} 13. O-O {I made this move some time after my previous move and forgot about the knight being attacked on d4. A mistake I often make in correspondence chess. Fingers crossed he misses it.  } Nc6 {Phew. Developing the knight and attacking my knight I decide to trade off.} 14. Nxc6 Qxc6 {Trading knights. At this point in the game the material is even. Advantages for white are that I have castled and development is proceeding. However I have a couple of unprotected pawns. Black has not yet castled but has advances and opportunities on the Queenside.} 15. Rac1 {Protecting the pawn attacked by the black Queen and occupying a semi-open file.} Qa4 {Hmmm. Dilemma. Black attacks my a pawn and I as much as I looked I could not see any way to stop going a pawn down. } 16. Rca1 {I decided to give him the c pawn to open the file up. May come in useful later on to mount an attack on the uncastled king.} Qxc2 17. b3 {Protecting the pawn } Qc8 {Retreating the queen and protecting the Rook. } 18. Rac1 {Devloping the Rook onto the open file while attacking the Queen.} Qd7 19. Qg3 {I played this move to give black some castling problems. If he moves his bishop to e7 I can ttake his g7 pawn, leavins his king in the open.} g6 {Preparing to fianchetto the bishop and castle to safety.} 20. f4 {Time to free up some lines and get my Rook into the action. If he captures the pawn I will take with the bishop, giving me a nice Queen and bishop battery. I didn't think he would because he is in despearate need of castling.} Bg7 {Preparing to castle.} 21. f5 {Pushing the pawn to further my attack.} a5 {? Perhaps was unsure about castling.} 22. f6 {f6!This move really cramps blacks position and makes the black king vulnerable at the same time limits blacksbishop and h Rook.} Bf8 {Retreating to safety.} 23. Rfd1 {Time to put some pressure on and attack down open and semi-open files.} Qe6 {Attacking the f-pawn and unpinning the Queen.} 24. Qf3 {Protecting the important f-pawn} h5 {Looking to make some space and attacking down the king side, bringing the Rook into play. Also gives the bishop an attacking square to get to on h6.} 25. Rc6 {Putting pressure on the d6 pawn. Now if black plays Bh6 the d6 pawn will fall, putting pressure on the Queen to find a safe square to get to.} Kd7 {Attacking the Rook and protecting d6 but brings the king on to a vulnerable square.} 26. Rdc1 {Boubling the Rooks and preparing to give chack on c7. At this point black is in a pretty tight spot. His development is poor, Rooks are not connected and he has some serious threats on the king.} Bh6 {In an attempt to connect Rooks and trade off my attackers.} 27. Rc6c7+ {Rc7! This move, I believe seals the game, and gives black no real options. } Kd8 {Retreating the King.} 28. Re7 {Re7! One of those rare moves that keep me coming back to the game. If black moves the Queen to g4, the only "safe" square the white delivers mate with Bb6#. Taking the Rook is the only option which leaves white in a winning position.} Qg4 29. Bb6# {Bb6#. }
