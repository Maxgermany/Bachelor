[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {White chooses a Queen opening to push aggressively into my territory} d5 {I counter} 2. Nf3 {a knight attack to win the sweet center of the board} e6 {but I start my opening routine unconcerned} 3. Bd2 {white is moving major pieces out, a good strategy, but I must continue to build my house for the king} Nf6 {this move is an example of that strategy} 4. e3 {white improves her position} g6 {my castle building continues} 5. Nc3 {white continues to develop major pieces, a good strategy} Bg7 {my castle is almost complete} 6. Bb5+ {white attacks early...} Nbd7 {I block with my knight} 7. Ng5 {white is pressing the attack. Now she has moved a major piece twice and the opening is still in full swing. This is a premature move and easily foiled.} O-O {I castle} 8. Qf3 {noiw white brings out her queen. This is really early in my opinion given the board. Lots of opportunity to lose the queen under the circumstances. } b6 {Ibegin to lay a trap for the queen} 9. Qh3 {white is thinking "checkmate". but again, not enough development has occurred and this is easily turned back } Re8 {I continue my opening development} 10. Nxd5 {white brings force to the attack - a good strategy} Nxd5 {but unguarded the knight is captured, this is a grevious error} 11. c4 {pawns to the rescue...too late} Qxg5 {now this is a strange move..why not take the knight?} 12. cxd5 {and she does so...} Qxd5 {in exchange for a pawn} 13. a4 {good, an attack in the middle is best arepelled by an attack on the flank} Bb7 {my opening is almost complete} 14. Qh4 {white is positioning her queen for a major assault} Qxg2 {and in so doing, gives up a pawn. } 15. Ke2 {now she has to move defensively to protect her castle} Qf3+ {I am trying to get her to drop back to the first row so I can capture a rook...} 16. Kf1 {Excellent...} Qf5 {but I think I sense danger if I do that...so I drop back } 17. Bxd7 {now why did white not capture a rook here? Because she was trying to ensure a mate with her Bishop and Queen I believe.} Red8 {so instead, I will threaten her} 18. Qe7 {a good move to bring the Queen into the attack, but my King is in his castle, and well protected. } Bxh1 {so I capture her rook} 19. Bb4 {this IS dangerous...but again, as I assess the situation, premature. There is no way for her to mate me in the current allignment as far as I can tell. } Qh3+ {So I try to control the game by keeping her King in check and manouvering him to a certain mate} 20. Ke2 {he escapes for now. } Qf3+ {"hello"} 21. Kd2 {"run away"} Qxf2+ {"hello"} 22. Kd3 {"run away again"} Qxh2 {Hmmm stymied....I have to regroup..actually, this was a wasted move. A move to h4 would have been swifter} 23. Rf1 {here comes more white force} Rdf8 {I better protect myself} 24. Bxe6 {even with all this fire power, I cannot see white achieving mate in this configuration.} fxe6 {and to sacrifice a Bishop for a pawn is another mistake.} 25. Qxe6+ {even with this, I am not concerned. } Kh8 {my King is almost invulnerable in this situation.} 26. Bxf8 {but a good capture leads to...} Bxf8 {a recapture...} 27. Rf7 {so how to capture my King...this move is not a bad move, in that it brings force to the battle, but it is not enough given the nature of my defense} Rd8 {I start to think about mate...} 28. Qf6+ {a good check...forcing my hand} Kg8 {now what?} 29. e4 {Aah the opening I have been waiting for. } Qh3+ {check} 30. Kc4 {the King is forced into trouble} Bxe4 {one move away from mate, white resigns... a good game marked by a couple of mistakes and attacks that occur too early in development with not enough force easily repelled and taken advantage of. }
