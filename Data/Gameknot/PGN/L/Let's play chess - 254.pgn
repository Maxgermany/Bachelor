1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {This variation of the Scandinavian Defence offers everything a good gambit should: a lead in development and lines of attack.  In other words, lots of fun for the aggressive player!} 3. d4 Nxd5 4. c4 Nb6 5. Nf3 g6 {5... Bg4 also has a good attack potential.  } 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. h3 c5 {!? One of the perennial problems with this gambit line for black is white's space advantage in the centre, which is important I think to challenge at every opportunity.  This move of course enhances the pressure already being exerted all along the a1-h8 diagonal by black's g7 bishop.} 8. Be3 O-O {Strikes a hard pace with respect to development without letting up on the pressure!  With the Scandinavian, I always go for tension and complication.  8... cxd4 merely allows white to precipitate a blood bath (9. Bxd4 Bxd4 10. Qxd4 Qxd4 11. Nxd4) that simplifies things to his advantage.} 9. dxc5 {Other moves are possible (e.g. 9. d5), but clearly white wants to relieve some pressure.} Qxd1+ {I decide to exchange queens seeing the opportunity not only to keep his king exposed in the centre a little longer, but also the additional opportunity triple up his queen-side pawns. } 10. Rxd1 {10. Nxd1 and black can strike back with 10... Na4 which forces white to concede his pawn advantage (for example, 11. Rb1 Bf5 12. Rc1 Nxb2).} Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 Na4 {The logical move to make given white's weakness on the queenside, and given how his pawns are lined up like ducks in a shooting gallery!  At this point, I would say that black has achieved equality with white. } 12. Bd4 Nd7 13. c6 bxc6 14. Bd3 c5 15. Bc2 {!? This surprised me as I had thought 15. Be3 the obvious move to make.  } Nb2 16. Rb1 Nxc4 {This is the idea behind 15. Bc2: that I would make this natural-looking, but inferior move.  The best response is 16... Rb8 first aiming to do moves like ... Nxc4 later. } 17. Be4 {! and white deservedly wins himself some momentum.  The battle, as they say, is joined!} cxd4 18. Bxa8 Ndb6 19. Be4 dxc3 20. O-O {14. Rc1 Na4 15. O-O would have been better.} Nd2 {! This of course facilitates the advancement of the pawn to the seventh rank, which would of course worry my opponent!} 21. Nxd2 cxd2 22. Bf3 Nc4 {I am not sure, but 22... Rd8 23. Rfd1 Bf5 might have been better.} 23. Rb4 {23. Be2 is better.} Be6 24. Rb7 {? The black knight (being placed on b2) is the real threat, which 24. Be2 a5 25. Rxc4 Bxc4 26. Bxc4 eliminates.} Rd8 {!} 25. Rxa7 Nb2 26. Rxe7 Bxa2 27. Ra7 Bc4 28. Rb1 d1=Q+ 29. Bxd1 Rxd1+ 30. Rxd1 Nxd1 31. Ra1 Nb2 32. g4 Be6 33. Kh2 Nd3 34. Kg3 g5 35. Ra6 h5 36. f3 h4+ 37. Kg2 Bd5 38. Ra3 Ne1+ 39. Kf2 Nxf3 40. Rd3 Bc6 41. Rxf3 Bxf3 42. Kxf3 Kg7 43. Ke4 Kf6 44. Kd4 Ke6 45. Ke4 f5+ {!? The only way for black to win is to confuse white into making a mistake, which I hoped to surprise him into doing with this move.} 46. gxf5+ Kf6 47. Kf3 Kxf5 48. Kg2 {?? A terrible blunder.  The correct move is 48. Ke3, upon which I would have given up and offered him a draw.} Ke4 {!!} 49. Kf2 Kf4 50. Kg2 Ke3 51. Kh1 Kf3 52. Kh2 Kf2 53. Kh1 Kg3 54. Kg1 Kxh3 {White resigns 0-1.}
