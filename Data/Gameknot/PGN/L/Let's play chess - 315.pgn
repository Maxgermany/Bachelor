[Opening "Modern defence (A40)"]

1. d4 g6 {Queen's pawn opening, black plays "Beefeater" defense. } 2. e3 Bg7 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. c3 O-O {Here black's left side is well developed, while nothing has happened on the right.  This is ok because white has chosen to create a pawn phalanx.  White dominates the center, but largely only with the pawns.} 5. Bd3 d5 6. h4 {White sends out a sentry to attack black's fortress.} Bg4 7. Nbd2 Nc6 8. O-O {? Castling after breaking up the castle pawns seems slightly questionable.} e5 {Oops, white owns e5.} 9. Qc2 {It was a free pawn.  Now white faces a pawn pin, Pe4.  Black trades up two pawns for a knight or bishop, and wreaks havoc on the white castle.} a6 {?  What was wrong with Pe4?  Especially when white dxPe5 is hanging out there.} 10. Nxe5 {...or Nxe5.  Even better for white.} Nxe5 11. f3 Nxd3 {Nice recovery.  fxg4 would be followed by Nxc1, QxN, leaving black still ahead.} 12. Qxd3 Bf5 13. e4 dxe4 14. fxe4 Nxe4 {?  Black tosses his material advantage with this move.} 15. Nxe4 Qxh4 {Sweet move.} 16. Bf4 Rfe8 17. Bg3 {?  This does not prevent QxB, NxQ, BxQ.  Rfd1, then white must move the bishop which ends with white's BxPc7.  Never mind--that chain isn't good.  QxNe4 gives rich pickings.} Bxe4 {Finally there is that.  Probably the best of the possible exchanges.} 18. Bxh4 Bxd3 19. Rf2 Re4 20. Bf6 Bxf6 21. Rxf6 Rae8 22. Rf3 Re4e3 23. Kf2 Rxf3+ 24. Kxf3 Kg7 25. b4 Bc4 26. a4 Re2 27. b5 Rc2 28. bxa6 bxa6 {Bxa6 keeps the pawns from being split, but I like Bd5+ even better.  No, Rxc3+, then deal with white's a pawn.} 29. Ra3 Rb2 {Bd5+ yields white's g pawn.} 30. a5 Rb3 {Yes.} 31. Rxb3 Bxb3 32. g4 h6 33. Kf4 Kf6 34. Ke4 h5 35. gxh5 gxh5 36. d5 Bxd5+ {Kind of expensive, but yes, white won't be able to circumvent the black king.} 37. Kxd5 Kf5 {Right move!} 38. c4 h4 39. c5 h3 40. Kc6 h2 41. Kxc7 h1=Q 42. c6 Ke6 43. Kb6 Qf1 44. c7 Kd7 45. Kb7 Qc4 46. Kb6 {Here the writing is on the wall.  Black has a good end game.} Qxc7+ 47. Kxa6 Qc6+ 48. Ka7 Kc7 49. a6 Qb6+ 50. Ka8 Qxa6# {}
