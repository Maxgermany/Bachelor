1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.} 3. exf5 {This is a less common line, looking somewhat like a King's Gambit with the colors reversed. I don't think it generally fares as well as 3.Nxe5.} e4 {Black kicks the White Knight and aggressively establishes some space on the center. Whether he'll be able to hold it or not is another matter.} 4. Nd4 {Standard is 4.Ne5 Nf6 5.Be2, but this is playable as well. } Qf6 {Threatening the Knight and developing the Queen to a surprisingly safe, effective location. Black intends to make the very most of his half-open f-file.} 5. c3 {I can't find any literature for this move. I think 5.Qh5+ is probably stronger (5...g6 6.fxg6 and now if 6...Qxg6 7.Qe5+ wins the Rook, so 6...Qxd4 7.g7+ Ke7 and White promotes on move 8, winning material and stymieing the potential Black offensive.} d5 {? This seems logical but I think it's actually too defensive-minded. It's intended to release Black's other Bishop, but I think advancing the d-pawn can wait while Black runs the White Knight out of town with 5...c5 6.Nb5 Qc6 7.Qh5+ Kd8. Now Black can play ...d5 and ...c4 at his leisure, driving the Knight almost off the board altogether while securing the whole center for himself and preventing White from developing either of his Bishops.} 6. Qh5+ {White prepares to win a pawn.} g6 {6...Kd8 is probably better here. The text sacrifices quite a bit of material for open lines--much riskier, but certainly in the spirit of the Latvian.} 7. fxg6 hxg6 {If 7...Qxg6? 8.Qe5+ wins the Rook and probably the game.} 8. Qxd5 Ne7 {Black sacrifices another pawn in exchange for developing with tempo.} 9. Qxe4 Bf5 {And another (b7) ...} 10. Nxf5 {Note that White couldn't win the Black Rook immediately with 10.Qxb7 because of ...Qe5+ 11.Be2 Be4. Now, however, Qxb7 followed by Qxa8 is a threat.} gxf5 {?! Black now dumps yet another pawn, as well as his queenside Rook. White has nothing developed but his Queen, but Black is running out of pieces altogether.} 11. Qf3 {White decides his three-pawn lead should be sufficient for now, and declines the Rook that Black was offering in favor of keeping his Queen nearby.} Nbc6 {Black's Knight blocks the vulnerable b-pawn and develops toward the center. With this move Black also prepares to castle long, getting his King to safety and bringing his other Rook into play. Another good-looking option was 11...Bh6, making White's developmental choices even more nightmarish by pinning his d-pawn.} 12. Bb5 {White prepares his own castle and momentarily pressures the Nc6. I think c4 might have been a stronger place to develop this Bishop, in order to prevent a Black Knight from coming to d5 after Black castles.} O-O-O {All of Black's pieces are now in the game. His DSB needs a better square and h6 is still tempting (pinning the d-pawn), but Black also wants to leave the h-file open for pressure against White's upcoming castle.} 13. d4 {White gains some much-needed play for his own QB and QN. He has the makings of a dangerous attack against the Black queenside.} Nxd4 {?! This sacrifice doesn't seem sound at all to me, but it slims down White's queenside pawns and gives Black a big lead in space, at the cost of half-opening the c-file for a White Rook.} 14. cxd4 Qxd4 {Black now has plenty of space and uncontested control of the d-file.} 15. O-O {? The WK skedaddles, which is pretty reasonable. However, this move allows the beautiful and deadly Black Queen to eliminate a critical White piece from the board. Black didn't have any immediate threats; simple queenside development with 15.Nc3 would have been a better choice.} Qe5 {! Black threatens mate on h2, leaving White no time to get his LSB out of danger.} 16. Bf4 {This is a powerful, dangerous diagonal for White's QB to occupy. There are a lot of pieces pointed at the BK.} Qxb5 17. Na3 {Driving the BQ away and offering the pawn on b2-- White's position is very strong after 17...Qxb2 18. Rab1 Qxa2 19.Qxb7+ Kd7 20.Rfd1+ Ke8 21.Rxd8+ Kxd8 22.Qxc7+ Ke8 23.Rb8+ Kf7 24.Nb5. } Qb4 {Black doesn't take the bait, instead positioning his Queen where she can support d4 and prevent the White Knight from charging up to b5 or c4.} 18. Rac1 {White completes his development and bears down on c7.} Nc6 {The Knight finally gets off the a3-f8 diagonal and puts itself between White's attack and the BK, preparing to jump into action with a much more powerful post on d4.} 19. Bg5 {?! I'm not sure about this move. Black's pieces are somewhat disjointed, and cannot defend both the Rook and the f-pawn in one move, but by pulling his Bishop off the h2-b8 diagonal, White relieves some of the pressure on the BK.} Nd4 {! Black's Knight leaps to a very strong centralized position, defending the f-pawn and gaining time to get the Rook out of the way as well.} 20. Qe3 {Basically forced. Somewhere to keep pressure on the Black queenside would be preferable, but 20.Qg3 and 20.Qf4 both lose immediately to ...Ne2+!} Rd7 {Black can now casually lift his Rook out of danger, threatening to swing over to the Kingside for a devastating attack.} 21. Bf6 {!? White threatens the dangerous Rh8, but this attack is easily-parried and White is starting to lose sight of his formerly-strong attack on the Black King.} Bg7 {?! Black eagerly offers a trade for the piece that can best defend White's kingside. If now 22.Bxg7 Rxg7 Black has dangerous-looking attack down his half-open kingside files, but the Nd4's position becomes fairly tenuous and White may have a terrific attack through the center.} 22. Bxg7 Rxg7 23. Rfd1 Nc6 {No attempt to maintain the Knight on d4 is feasible, because of 24.Rc4.} 24. Qd3 {Threatening f5 as well as a mating battery down the d-file, should the Black pieces stop defending d7 and d8.} Qf4 {Black struggles to keep his counterplay alive, threatening to clean up some White pawns with tempo, or otherwise tempt White into weakening his kingside fortress.} 25. h3 {This defends against 25...Qxh2+ 26.Kf1 Qxg2+, but now White needs to keep a careful eye on his weak h3-pawn, as it is only defended by the Queen and allowing a Black Rook to open the h-file would be devastating.} Ne5 {! Black's Knight returns to the center with a multitude of threats. The primary danger is that the threat on the WQ leaves her with very few locations to retreat to from which she can still defend h3. The Queen is also the only defender of f3, where the Knight is looking to deliver a nasty check, so 26.Qd2 and Qd4 (thinking to trade off the powerful BQ) are impossible.} 26. Kf1 {?? Overly concerned about the pin and various checking possibilities for Black, White completely forgets about the immediate threat to his Queen. Best was probably 26.Qe3 Nf3+ 27.Kf1 Nh2+ 28.Ke2 Qxe3+ 29.Kxe3 Rxg2, where White will be a pawn down but with decent positional compensation.} Nxd3 27. Rxd3 {? Not that it matters, but White certainly can't afford to drop a Rook as well.} Qxc1+ {0-1. White's position is completely hopeless, and he resigns.
