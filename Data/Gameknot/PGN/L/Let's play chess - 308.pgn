1. e4 {Book move} e5 {Book move} 2. Nf3 {Book move } Nf6 {Book move  My prefered opening during situations like this. Risky, but if played well I believe it is better than the Nc6 response. } 3. Nc3 {Book Move   More safe play then the exchange, that devolpes another piece. This response is the most common } Nc6 {Book move  Occasionaly I will play Bb4.} 4. Bc4 {Basic response fights for controll of the center. } Bc5 {Symmetrical mimic works fair in this situation.} 5. Ng5 {Aggressive move attacking the king's castle side while threating the f pawn. Also common play.} O-O {Perhaps unsafe, but if the exchange is made on f7 I will sustain more controll then my opponent. Threatens exposing the kingnthough..} 6. Bxf7+ Rxf7 7. Nxf7 Kxf7 8. O-O {Opposition castles into saftey seeing no quick way to exploit my army.} d6 {Provides support for my central pieces a well as devolpes a opening for my bishop.} 9. Nd5 {Creats an central outpost, from the supporting f-pawn. I thought thisbwould occur.} Be6 {Devolps the bishop to a very mobile square while threating the knight.} 10. d3 {Opens up the bishops file, but neglects to counter the threat posed last move. Perhaps c4 would have been better.} Bxd5 {Takes advantage of the mistake, preparing for a material advantage while still maintaining central dominance.} 11. exd5 Nxd5 12.
