1. e4 {3rd Game between blackbaron and myself.  I am down most of this game although only by a single pawn.  I have chosen this game because it shows that an exchange offered is not always an exchange that should be accepted.  } e6 2. Nf3 d5 {Trying to open the center.} 3. e5 {This should let to a closed game.} c5 4. Nc3 d4 5. Ne4 Nc6 6. Bc4 {3 Minor pieces developed as opposed to blacks 1 piece.  Although i am down behind in pawn development and my e pawn is weak.} a6 7. d3 b5 {I didn't really mind this move,  I feel that it weakens the queenside.} 8. Bb3 {if 8...c4 then i open up the queenside.  I was hoping for this but it was not to be.} Nge7 9. Bg5 {Pinning the knight for now.} h6 {Not for long though.} 10. Bh4 Qa5+ {I feel this is a little too early on blacks side.} 11. Nfd2 Nxe5 12. Nd6+ Kd7 {Just a spite check and easily dealt with,  Main goal was to prevent castling.} 13. Nd6e4 Qb6 {Concession by black that Qa5 was incorrect.} 14. a3 Bb7 15. Qe2 Ne7g6 16. Bg3 Be7 17. O-O {Safety first :-)} Bxe4 18. Bxe5 Nxe5 19. Qxe4 Bd6 20. Rab1 Qc6 21. Qe2 f5 22. Rfe1 Rae8 {Blacks king is rather open there at the back. This was the main point of the spite check.  Although i could't plan for this position I was rather happy to find his king hanging in limbo.} 23. c4 {Looking to break up the centre.} bxc4 24. Bxc4 g5 25. b4 Nxc4 26. Nxc4 g4 {I pondered on this position for some time and then decided the best move was to remove his bishop.  His next move is forced to save his queen.} 27. Ne5+ Bxe5 28. Qxe5 Qd6 {Black offers exchange.  I was ok with this but i wanted to make up the pawn defecit first.} 29. bxc5 Qxe5 30. Rxe5 {All square.} Reb8 31. Rb4 {Looking to link up a pawn chain.} Rxb4 32. axb4 Rb8 {Not much i can do to save the pawn.  I need to look at at least equal material.} 33. h3 h5 34. Kh2 Rxb4 35. Kg3 a5 36. c6+ {I wanted to hold on to this pawn but i saw there was no way to safely guard it.  } Kxc6 37. Rxa5 Rb5 {I calculated at this point that should i accept the exchange that black would be able to recapture and get back in time to capture my d pawn and protect his d pawn all the way to promotion.  If this happens then i would lose.  } 38. Ra8 {Exchange declined.} Rb3 39. Ra6+ Rb6 {Exchange once again offered.} 40. Ra4 {Same outcome so exchange declined.} e5 41. hxg4 hxg4 42. Kh4 Kd6 43. Kg5 {Looking to undermine blacks pawns from behind.} Ke6 44. Ra3 Rb2 45. Ra6+ {I am down a pawn and i thought i would end up losing this game but anything can happen here.  Neither of us are top players so it can still swing with a mistake. I played on.} Kd5 46. Kxf5 Rxf2+ 47. Kxg4 Rxg2+ 48. Kf5 Rf2+ 49. Kg5 Rc2 50. Kf6 Rc3 51. Ra5+ {At this point i was in with a chance.  Black has to deal with the check.  He cant immediately capture my pawn and should he move his king i could capture the e5 pawn.  I would happily have accepted a draw here but he played on and so did i.} Rc5 {This sealed blacks fate.  Offering the exchange.  If I accept it would leave his king too far away to protect his pawns.  } 52. Rxc5+ {I accept and its all over for black.} Kxc5 53. Kxe5 Kc6 54. Kxd4 Kd6 {Now just to escort the pawn up for promotion.} 55. Ke4 Ke6 56. d4 Kd6 57. d5 Ke7 58. Ke5 Kd7 59. d6 Ke8 60. Ke6 Kd8 61. d7 Kc7 62. Ke7 {Black resigned.  It was close for sometime blackbaron.  Thanks for the game mate.}
