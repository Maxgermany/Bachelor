1. f4 {Hi everyone. I was challenged to this game by one of my good friends (i played black). His rating was 1175 when we started, and I was at 1492. He tried my opening as white, and i thought i would respond with....} Nc6 {Nc6. I didn't really care for moving any of the center pawns just yet.} 2. e3 d5 3. d4 {I don't like this move, and it's obvious why. White does control e5, but his white squares are weak and he creates a backward pawn on e3. For those of you who don't know what a backward pawn is, it's a pawn that cannot be guarded by another pawn. Thus, he has to commit one of his pieces to defending it if it gets attacked.} Nf6 4. Nf3 Bf5 {Development....wanting to get the bishop out before I close the diagonal off.} 5. Nc3 e6 6. h3 {Don't understand the point of this move... maybe to play g4 next} Bb4 {As you can see now I have all minor pieces developed with no real weaknesses.} 7. Bd2 Ne4 8. a3 {Not a good move either. Reason for that is now I can play Bxc3 and after Bxc3, I have Nxc3.} Bxc3 9. Bxc3 Nxc3 {Now he must take with the b pawn. You generally don't want doubled pawns because they are hard to defend.} 10. bxc3 Be4 11. c4 {Good move, trying to get rid of the double pawn.} O-O 12. c5 {?????? I thought he would take....} Qe7 13. c4 Rad8 {Playing to blast open the middle. I want to do this because I have a more solid position.} 14. Ne5 Nxe5 {Don't want that knight to do anything and my knight on c6 wasn't doing much.} 15. fxe5 f6 {Again playing to open up the center. But I saw this and I wanted to open up the f-file for my rook.} 16. Bd3 {This doesn't do much, he should have castled or done something to keep it closed.} fxe5 17. Bxe4 Qh4+ {Very annoying check for him....} 18. Kd2 {He responds correctly.} Rf2+ {Unfortunately for him, another annoying check.} 19. Kc3 exd4+ 20. Qxd4 Qxe4 21. Qxe4 {He had to do this because I had Qc2 and that would be very inconvenient for him. Also, his g pawn is under alot of pressure.} dxe4 22. g4 {Getting the pawn out of harm's way....} a5 {I played this because rook d3 is checkmate. He really has only 2 choices, either to play King b3 or to get a rook on the d-file. But for now I am hoping he doesn't see it.} 23. h4 {He missed it...} Rd3# {So overall this game goes to show that position is very important. Hopefully you were able to take something from this. }
