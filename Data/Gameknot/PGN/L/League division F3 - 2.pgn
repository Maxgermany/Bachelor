1. g3 {This game I enjoyed playing. I took my time and managed to keep my opponent busy while I improved my position and eventually won the game} e5 {I started with g3 in order to fianchetto.  Black went with e5 and taking the centre space.} 2. e4 {Now I move e4 also taking centre space.  } Qf6 {Black brings out his queen which is attacking my f2 pawn. } 3. Nf3 {Now I moved my knight to f3 attacking black's centre pawn and blocking black queen's line to my f2 pawn.} Bc5 {Black brings out his DB to e5 which is attacking my f2 pawn.  Sorry it is c5.  I do get lost with the files when I am black but as I am white it should be easier.} 4. Qe2 {I move my queen to e2 to avoid black's DB taking my f2 pawn and my king having to recapture.} d6 {Black moves pawn to d6 which allows his LB to access the diagonal to h3 and form a pawn chain with e5.} 5. d3 {I reciprocate with d3 and this allows my DB access to the diagonal to h6 whilst also forming a pawn chain with e4.} Nc6 {Black develops his b knight to c6 which also protects his e5 pawn.} 6. Bg5 {I move my DB to g5 attacking the queen on f6.  My DB is protected by f3 knight.} Qg6 {Black moves his queen to g6 which leaves my DB full access to the diagonals from g5 to d8 and g5 to c1.} 7. Nc3 {I now develop my b knight to c3 which protects my e5 pawn.  My c3 knight has access to d5 and b5 which  gives me the ability to attack the 7th rank.  D5 also allows my knight to protect a lot more squares.} h6 {Black pushes a pawn to h6 attacking my DB at g5.} 8. Bh4 {I move my DB to h4 and it still has control of the d8 diagonal.} Bg4 {Now black moves his LB to g4 pinning my knight to my queen at e2.  Now the path is clear for his king to castle.  Except I have the DB pointing at the d8 square so black is unable to castle.} 9. Bg2 {I move my LB to g2 at last!  Now I have the option to castle either long or short.} Nge7 {Black now develops his last piece, his knight to e7 which protects his queen at g6 and also brings the knight together.  It also prevents my DB from now attacking the d8 square and black could castle either side.} 10. O-O {I castle short.  I think this is the best side as it affords the king a good deal of protection from my pieces} Nd4 {Black does not castle but moves his c6 knight to d4 attacking my queen at e2.  My queen is already in a pin from black's LB at g4.  I could recapture with my f3 knight but this leaves my queen en prise.} 11. Bxe7 {So I attack to distract black and I capture the e7 knight with my DB.} Kxe7 {Black's king captured my DB   I think black may have made the wrong move as he could have taken my queen and come back later for the DB.  Now he cannot castle.} 12. Qd2 {I move my queen out of threat of the pin from black's LB and from the d4 knight.  The queen moves to d2 and is now on a diagonal to h6.} Bxf3 {So black captures my knight at f3 and is now protected by the d4 knight.  My LB at g2 could capture but would be recaptured by the knight so I don't think I want to do this just now.} 13. Nd5+ {I now check the king with Nd5.} Kd8 {Black's king moves to d8 blocking his a8 rook.} 14. Bh3 {Now I bring my LB onto the h3 square and now control the diagonal to c8.} h5 {Black moves his pawn h6 to h5.  I would think black wants to prepare to defend his king as his king is now vulnerable but he is beginning to bring down his pawns.  And with his queen at g6 and his pieces especially his LB on the king's territory at f3 he may feel he has a good attacking position.} 15. Bg2 {I bring my LB back to g2 as I can retake with my king if black decides to capture my LB.  Although the queen is at g6 I am not worried as my pawns are intact and will defend any attack from the queen.} Bxg2 16. Kxg2 {Black captures my LB and I recapture with the king.} h4 {Black now pushes his h5 pawn to h4 and I cannot afford to push my g3 pawn as the queen would take immediately and my king would be in check.  So what to do?  Of course if it takes then this will provide a hiding place for the king or the pawn may push to h3 and check the king.  This will be a nuisance and can be a big problem as black will be looking to queen this pawn in the future.} 17. Ne7 {I decide I need to distract black again and move Ne7 which is very risky.  The king has nothing to lose he won't castle anyway so can capture the knight.  The moves attacks the queen but seems to have no real threat as the queen can move away and leave the knight there as he poses no threat to the king!} Kxe7 {So the king captures as expected.  The king is now on e7 but I am not sure this gives me any chances to attack.  For my attack on the queen I am now down 2 pieces.} 18. f3 {I move pawn f2 to f3 to join up my pawn with e4.} hxg3 {Black captures the pawn at g3 which is what I would have wanted to happen as this now leaves my king sheltered behind the passed pawn.} 19. h3 {I push my h2 pawn to h3 which black cannot take with his h8 rook as the king would recapture.} Qh5 {Now black moves his queen to h5 and it looks like it could all be over for white.  Watch this space!!} 20. Rfh1 {I moved my f rook to h1 and black's attack is thwarted.} Nxf3 {Now black's knight comes to f3 and is attacking my queen again.  But otherwise no threat.} 21. Qc3 {I move my queen to c3.} Nh2 {Black moves his knight to h2.} 22. d4 {I push my d3 pawn to d4 attacking black's DB at c5 and the pawn at e5.  I now have an attack on black's g3 pawn.  Black's queen now has access to e2 and a check on the king.  I think that this was a chance that black missed.  } exd4 {Black captures my d4 pawn with his e5 pawn.  Now my queen is attacked, but what will be my next move, obviously take the g3 pawn which is en prise.  I think that the queen at c3 was a diversion for black which allowed him to miss the important point that my queen was not really a risk as I could not capture without the risk of losing my queen.  So the important thing for black was to protect his g3 pawn which he failed to do.} 23. Qxg3 {The pawn is captured and now the knight is at risk.  I am down 2 pieces and 2 pawns.} Nf3 {Black moved his knight out of danger at h2 to f3 and now enjoys the protection of the queen at h5.} 24. Qxf3 {However this did not stop me taking the knight and should black capture the queen then my king would recapture.} Rae8 {Black leaves the queen at h5 opposite my queen at f3 and moves his 'A' rook to e8 behind the king.  Perhaps a better place for the rook would have been f8 on the same file as my queen which may have forced me to move my queen.} 25. h4 {I push my h3 pawn to h4 protected by my h1 rook.  This allows my rook to move up the h file and also activate my 'A' rook. } Qg6+ {Black moves his queen to check the king at g6.} 26. Kh3 {I move the king over to g3 using my h4 pawn to shield the king.  I think I may have been better moving my king onto the e file.  What I don't see is the fact that my king cannot move onto the g file now and black's rook can come down the h file.  } Qh6 {Black moves his queen to h6 to help with a check attack on the king.  This is where black could have finished the game with instead of Qh6 he should have gone with the move "15. ....Rxh4+, 16. Kxh4, Rh8, 17. Qh4, Rxh4#"} 27. Rag1 {I move my 'A' rook over to g1 and now black's queen cannot move onto files f or g without being captured.} Kd8 {Black moves his king to a safer position with a move to d8.} 28. Qf5 {I move my queen to f5 a move which I do not feel was a very useful move.  I was already protecting my pawn but maybe I thought if black's d6 pawn came to d5 then I could capture this.  A better move would have been f4  protecting both my pawns but the white queen had no protection so that was not possible with the black queen at h6.} d3 {Black pushes his d4 pawn to d3 attacking my c2 pawn.  This move was never going to go anywhere as I could recapture with my c2 pawn.} 29. Rg4 {I am not sure I realised the threat to my king from Qxh4, although the king had an escape route via g2, I decide to move my rook to g4 to protect this pawn.} Qe3+ {Now black checks the king with Qe3+and this also protects his d3 pawn.} 30. Rg3 {I move my rook to g3 to block the check.} Qe2 {Black queen moves to e2.} 31. Qf3 {I move my queen to f3 attacking the queen and the d3 pawn.} Qxc2 {Black captures my c2 pawn.} 32. Qxd3 {I capture the d3 pawn with my queen.} Qf2 {Black moves his queen to f2 protected by the DB at c5.} 33. Rf1 {I move my h1 rook to f1 and attack the queen protected by my queen at g3.} Qd4 {The black queen moves to d4 and my queen is on d3.  The black queen is attacking both my b2 pawn.  Black queen is also attacking my pawn at e4 along with the rook at e8 as well.  I think black's best move would have been to capture my pawn with the rook as this would have brought one of the rooks into play.  This would have caused more problems for me as up till now I only had to respond to the queen's attacks. } 34. Rf4 {So I decide to protect the e4 pawn again by moving the f1 rook to f4.} Qxb2 {Black moves the queen to b2 and captures my pawn.} 35. Rg2 {I attack the queen with Rg2.} Qc1 {Black moves his queen to c1 attacking my f4 rook.} 36. Qg3 {I move my queen to g3 protecting both my rooks on f4 and g2 and the pawn at h4.  Maybe this queen is a bit overloaded.} f6 {Black decides to move another piece besides the queen and moves f7 pawn to f6.} 37. Re2 {I move my g2 rook to e2 to provide further protection to the e4 pawn.} Qh1+ {Black checks my king with Qh1+} 38. Rh2 {I move my e2 rook to h2 and block the check.} Qb1 {Black moves his queen to b1 attacking my a2 pawn.} 39. Qb3 {I move my queen to b3 to prevent the capture of my pawn.} Qe1 {Black moves his queen to e1 and is attacking my e4 pawn with his queen and the rook at e8.} 40. Qf3 {I move my queen to f3 to provide 2nd defence of my pawn.} b6 {Black pushes his b7 pawn to b6.} 41. Rg4 {I move my rook to g4 attacking the pawn at g7.} Bg1 {Black moves his DB to g1 attacking my rook at h2.} 42. Rhg2 {I move my h2 rook to g2 to attack the DB.} Bc5 {Black returns his DB to c5.} 43. Re2 {I move my rook to e2 attacking the queen at e1.} Qa5 {The black queen moves to a5 and is still attacking my pawn at a2.} 44. Rxg7 {I capture the g7 pawn with my rook.} Bd4 {Black moves his DB to d4 and may be planning to move his pawn at f6 which would leave my rook in a vulnerable position at g7.} 45. Qf5 {I move my queen to f5 , blocking the pawn on f6, and I am now looking to checkmate the king on d7 with the rook at g7.} Qa3+ {Black checks the king with Qa3+.} 46. Kg2 {The king moves out of check as I saw this could be fatal if the rook at h8 came down to take the pawn on h4 it would be checkmate.} Rxh4 {Black captures the pawn on h4 with his rook.} 47. Qd7# {I make my final move with Qd7 and its checkmate.}
