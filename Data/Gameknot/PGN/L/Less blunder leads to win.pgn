1. e4 a6 2. d4 b5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bd3 e6 5. Bg5 {White concentrates on developing minor pieces, while Black attempts to push Pawns forward.} Bb4+ 6. c3 Ba5 7. O-O {White misses 7. e5} O-O 8. e5 {But Black did not see e5 either. White earns advantage.} c5 9. exf6 gxf6 10. Be3 Qc7 11. dxc5 Bb7 12. b4 {11. ... Bb7 was a blunder. Now Bishop has nowhere to go.} Nc6 13. bxa5 Kh8 14. Bd4 e5 15. Be3 Qxa5 16. Be4 Qc7 17. Qd6 {White tries to trade Queens, since he has material advantage.} Qxd6 18. cxd6 Rfg8 19. Bd5 Rg6 20. Bxf7 Rg7 21. Be6 {Foolish blunder by White... Why did I miss it?} dxe6 22. Rd1 Na5 {Aiming for 23. ... Bxf3. But white defenses.} 23. Kf1 Bxf3 24. gxf3 Rag8 25. Ke2 {Forced move. Otherwise White have to protect his Rook.} Nc4 26. a4 {Blunder which will loose a Pawn.} Nb2 27. Rd2 Nc4 {I think Black wanted to remove White's passed Pawn rather than taking material advantage.} 28. Rda2 Nxd6 29. axb5 Nxb5 30. Ra2xa6 Nc7 31. Rc6 e4 {I don't know Black's intention, but I think this is not a good move.} 32. fxe4 f5 33. exf5 exf5 34. Bd4 {Black's Rook is pinned.} Re8+ 35. Kf1 Ne6 {Black's blunder. After 36. Rxe6, Black cannot retake White's Rook since 37. Rxa8 will lead to Checkmate.} 36. Rxe6 Reg8 37. Bxg7+ Kxg7 38. Ra7+ Kh8 39. Ree7 Rg7 40. Rexg7 f4 41. Rgb7 f3 42. Rb8# {}
