1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 {Unusual opening with the queen, so to put mine on the field too.} Qf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nc3 g6 5. Qg5 Bg7 {Thought about 5...Qg5 6.Ng5 h6 also. But if 6.Qf6 happens my knight will be positioned near the centre.} 6. Nd5 Qd6 {I did not hope it. Anyway, it had a place to survive except its home square.} 7. d3 Nge7 8. Qh4 Nxd5 {I grabbed a pawn as soon as I saw it.} 9. exd5 Qxd5 10. Bh6 O-O 11. Bxg7 Kxg7 12. Qg5 Qe6 13. O-O-O d6 14. Re1 Qf5 15. Qd2 Qf6 16. Re4 {Thrilling move, I hardly manage my h-file.} Nd4 17. Nxd4 exd4 18. g3 Bd7 19. Rf4 Qe6 20. b3 Bc6 21. Rg1 Rfe8 22. Bg2 {Fantastic move for me!! So many pieces are ready to get off to the pavillion.} Bxg2 23. Rxg2 Qe1+ 24. Qxe1 Rxe1+ 25. Kd2 Ra1 {I wonder why I did not put 25...Rae8 and pick another pawn!! I saw it just after I made the move. What a mess?} 26. a4 c5 27. Re4 Kf8 28. f4 Re8 29. Rxe8+ Kxe8 30. Re2+ Kd7 31. h4 Rg1 {Another pawn is ready to be captured. That made my victory easier.} 32. Re4 Rxg3 33. c3 dxc3+ 34. Kxc3 f5 35. Rc4 Rh3 {Harvesting time!! Here comes my third pawn!!} 36. b4 b6 37. bxc5 bxc5 38. a5 a6 39. Ra4 Rxh4 40. Rc4 h5 41. Kb3 Rg4 42. d4 {Horrible move!! The final major piece goes out from the scene. My pawns are ready to the triumphant ride.......} Rxf4 43. dxc5 Rxc4 44. Kxc4 h4 {It is on the way....... A queen will come quickly, and finish up the game!! So, White resigns at the spot!}
