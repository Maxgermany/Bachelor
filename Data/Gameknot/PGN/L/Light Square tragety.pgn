[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C77), Wormald attack, Gruenfeld variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Main line Roy Lopez. Black harasses the LSB in order to gain space and time on the queen side. However, it comes at the cost of light square weakness and potentially over extended pawns. } 4. Ba4 Nf6 {The Berlin defence Black develops a knight and put immediate impedance on white to defend e4. } 5. Qe2 {Of course the usaully Nc3 is good but this queen move has the advantage that it can assist in the fight for light square dominance on the queen side. It can also act as a superise weapon that can be jsut enough to take your opponent out of book. In this idea black must be careful to not develop as normal with Be7 and d6. Or he will get crushed on f7.} b5 6. Bb3 {There is a lot of debate in Roy Lopez circles as to the usefulness of black's b5. Some contest that ...b5 only serves to drive the LSB to where it really wants to go and exposes black to light square attacks from the queen side. Then there those who contest that ...b5 is a must if black does not want to be crushed in the centre. Also if propertly used b5 can be a powerful wedge into white's position. It also give black the powerful c5 square for either his knight or bishop. } Be7 {This is a modest developing move that is often played in the Berlin defensive system. the idea is that after the captures on e4 and e5 black can drive the e5 knight away by improving the position of his to f6. Of course Be7 is not the only option for the DSB development. If he chooses he can transpose into the tricky Archangel defence system setup of Bc5 and Bb7. In that system black's bishops are very active. } 7. a4 {This is the more spirited move that has the idea of forcing black to play ...b4 at which point the b4 pawn is very vulnerable. In level positions the main task is to create a weakness. Black just can not play 7. ..Bxa4?  8. Rxa4 will give white tremdious power on the A- file. Also good but slower is the powerful deferred centre idea that follows from 7. c3. The idea in the closed centre idea is to push in the centre with d4 and transferr the B knight to g3 or e3 via d2 and f1. } b4 8. d4 {In this game I am clearly aiming to open lines and not giving black time to defend b4 with Rb8} d6 {8. ...d5?? has to be played to prevent the invasion of the queen along light squares. Also bad is 8. ...exd4 9. e5 Ng4 10. Qe4 gives white a winning advantage. } 9. Qc4 {!! wins. Black does not take care to protect his light squares so now he pays the price. If Black had played within well known theory this attack on f7 is childs play to defend.} Qd7 {forced or 9. ...d5  10. Qxf3+ Bd7 11. Qb7 is painful toture. } 10. Qxf7+ Kd8 11. Qxg7 Rf8 12. dxe5 dxe5 13. Bg5 {I am two pawns up and threatening to win the DSB and the knight with 14. Bf7! with Bxf6 to follow} Qe8 {only way to defend f6} 14. O-O {This rook is going on to the nice open d file. } Bd7 {black tries to plug the dike on the d-file} 15. Rd1 {improving my rook and pinning the bishop} Kc8 16. Nbd2 {defending e4} Nh5 {lloking to exchange bishops and put his knight on the outpost on f4} 17. Qh6 Nf4 18. Bc4 {?? played in haste. At the time I had not work out fully the ideas behind Bxf4 so I played a in between move. } Kb8 19. Bxf4 {Now I had worked out that 20. Bd5 wins the rook for a bishop. } exf4 20. Bd5 Qg6 21. Qxg6 hxg6 22. Nc4 {Black can not prevent 23. Nce5 with c3 to fall. } Be8 {avoiding the fork} 23. Nce5 Nxe5 24. Nxe5 Ra7 25. Bc6 {Black resigns}
