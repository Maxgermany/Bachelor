1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 e6 5. b3 c5 6. Bb2 {I have been experimenting with this Colle-Zukertort setup as white.  I don't always get good positions from it, but I rarely get terrible positions.} Nc6 7. a3 cxd4 8. exd4 Bd6 9. Nbd2 O-O 10. O-O {This is often the tabiya White has to work with.  There are several options for the middle game.} Rc8 11. c4 Bb8 12. Rc1 Qc7 13. Ne5 Bf5 {Black declines to trade Bishops.  } 14. Ndf3 Ne4 {Black plants a N on the e file as well.  Now it will get down to which player can make their pieces better.  I like Black's position here slightly better, so I have work to do.} 15. cxd5 exd5 {Both sides have isolated d pawns, but White's is better defended.} 16. b4 a6 {This allows White to sneak a pawn.} 17. Nxc6 bxc6 18. Bxa6 Rcd8 19. g3 Bg4 20. Be2 f5 21. Ne5 Bxe2 22. Qxe2 {Black has traded off White's good B, but White's N will be hard to dislodge after f5 has been played.} Rf6 23. f4 Rh6 24. Rc2 Rdd6 {Black tries to cook up an attack on the h file.} 25. Rfc1 g5 26. fxg5 Nxg5 27. Kg2 Ne4 {Although Black's N has a good outpost here, I expected to see Black try to use the open files to attack my K.} 28. b5 f4 {This allows White to sneak a second pawn, although the idea of cracking open the Kingside is correct.} 29. Qg4+ Kh8 30. Qxf4 {With White two pawns ahead, a win is probable IF I can just survive Black's Kingside attack.} Rdf6 31. Qe3 Qc8 {Black intends Qh3+, but moving the Q off the 7th rank allows White to win the exchange.} 32. Nf7+ Kg7 33. Nxh6 Rxh6 34. Qxh6+ {Surprise!  A rook fork is coming.} Kxh6 35. Rc2xc6+ Qxc6 36. bxc6 {White is now up the exchange + three pawns.  The deep passer should decide the game.} Bc7 37. Rb1 Kg6 38. Bc1 Nd6 39. Bf4 Kf6 40. Bxd6 Bxd6 41. Rb7 {Black will need to sacrifice the B to stop the pawn.} Ke6 42. Rxh7 {An immediate c7 could have been met with Kd7.  Now the pawn is headed home.} Bxa3 43. c7 {Black resigned here in view of the fact that the c7 pawn will promote.  White's advantage would be overwhelming.  I thought Black played this position well, but might have missed the surprising Qxh6+, which allowed White to simplify the position and remove Black's attacking chances.}
