1. e4 {Nice one, where a white's mistake in the beginning leads in a finale nicely won by the black.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 {Prefers the exchange variation} bxc6 5. Nxe5 Qe7 6. d4 f6 7. Qh5+ {?  In his effort to keep the pawn, white makes the mistake} g6 8. Qh4 {Perhaps better was Kxg6, hxg6, Qxg6, with 2 pawns for the lost knight (and black on check)} fxe5 9. Qxe7+ Bxe7 {Black welcomes the exchange, since it helps him develop, while he also has material advantage} 10. dxe5 d6 11. Bf4 dxe5 12. Bxe5 Bf6 13. Bxf6 Nxf6 {More welcome trades, white wins one more pawn, but the field is open now} 14. Nc3 O-O 15. O-O Bb7 {Wants to add pressure on e4} 16. Rad1 Rad8 17. Rxd8 Rxd8 {More exchanges are welcome, black also controls the free column...} 18. f3 Rd2 {Black rook attacks the 2nd line...} 19. Rf2 Rxf2 20. Kxf2 {Even more trades, black is hoping for an advantageous finale} Kf7 21. b4 Ke6 22. g4 Kd6 {Black gets its King into the game, since he lacks 2 pawns and his pawn structure is not that good, in exchange for his Bishop...} 23. h3 c5 24. bxc5+ Kxc5 {Improves his position, but the f3-e4 pawns seem a bit too strong...} 25. e5 Nd5 26. Ne4+ Kd4 27. e6 {Perhaps the white shouldn't have rushed into advancing his pawn, with the rest and his king  staying in the back...} Ne7 {Stops the pawn and hopes for an exchange (bishop for a knight) and maybe a pawn...} 28. c3+ Kc4 29. Ke3 {White manages to protect his pawn structure in the king's side, but black can win a pawn with: Bxe4, Kxe4, Kxc3, which opens the column for his pawn (c7). It has the disadvantage of letting the white king go towards the 6th-7th line, which could be dangerous, but black believes that, by sacrifising his Knight for the advanced pawn at the right moment, he can win the game.} Bxe4 30. Kxe4 Kxc3 31. Ke5 {Everything goes according to the plan...} Kd3 32. Kf6 Nd5+ 33. Kf7 Ke3 {Black wants to first make sure that the white won't be able to get another pawn towards promotion, after the knight x pawn.} 34. e7 Nxe7 35. Kxe7 {According to the plan, Knight takes the advanced pawn and it seems that black will be able to win this...} c5 {White is one move short...} 36. Kf7 c4 37. Kg7 c3 38. Kxh7 c2 39. Kxg6 c1=Q {Black achieved promotion... the game is actually finished now, despite white's further resistance...} 40. g5 Kxf3 41. h4 Qc6+ 42. Kh5 Qe8+ 43. g6 {Black is starting to get a bit worried, but believes he can do it in the end} Kf4 44. a3 Kf5 {And the game is actually over...  Follows   45.   a4   Qxg6 #  0-1 or.. 45.   Kh6 Qxg6 #  0-1} 45. Kh6 Qxg6# {Game finished...   0-1}
