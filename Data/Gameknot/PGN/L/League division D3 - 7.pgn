1. e4 {This is my first attempt at annotation, but it was a fun game with blunders on both sides.  Please feel free to comment if you see areas for potential improvement.  We begin with a King's pawn game.  That's my standard opening defense.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez.} a6 {I tend to try to push the bishop back with the a and b pawns.} 4. Bxc6 {Not an uncommon move.} dxc6 {I like to recapture with the d pawn to open the diagonal for my white bishop and the d file for my Queen.} 5. Nxe5 {First mistake of the game.  A little aggressive here.  Needed another defender on the e pawn before doing this because...} Qd4 {Qd4 threatens both the pawn and knight with no way to defend both.} 6. Nf3 {Sensible move.} Qxe4+ {Naturally.  Only two choices, Kf1 or Qe2.  Either way, white will not be able to castle.} 7. Qe2 Qxe2+ {I couldn't resist.} 8. Kxe2 Bg4 {Now I'm focused on development and castling my King.} 9. d3 Bc5 10. Be3 b6 {Mistake on my part here.  Better options would have been Bb6 or Bx3e.  You'll see why in a minute.} 11. Bxc5 {Capturing here and the subsequent recapture leads to awful...} bxc5 {Tripled pawns!  I'm not too happy right about now.} 12. c4 {Not sure what the goal of this move was.} Nf6 {More development.} 13. Nbd2 O-O 14. h3 {At this point with no material advantage and terrible tripled pawns I'm not willing to trade any material.  I can see the pawn advance coming on the king side, but didn't have much I could do about it.} Bh5 15. g4 Bg6 16. g5 Nd7 17. h4 Rfe8+ {Now I want to apply pressure and claim the center of the board before white can dismantle my Queen side and take a material advantage.} 18. Ne4 {Wasn't expecting this move.  This allows me to gain a pawn.} Bxe4 19. dxe4 Rxe4+ 20. Kd3 Rf4 {Applying pressure.  White can't move Ke3 or Ke2 because of the subsequent Rxc4, gaining more material.} 21. Rh3 Re8 {Again claiming the open e file.} 22. b3 {Not sure what the goal of this move was.} Ne5+ {At this point I have conceded to trading down material and the subsequent end game to follow.  I am making preparations for a favorable pawn set up.  If I can clear the Queen side and capture the white f pawn I think I can win the game.} 23. Nxe5 Rxe5 24. f3 {White sees the value of his King side pawns.} g6 {This move was really to claim the f5 square in case I had to pull back my rook.  I did not see what white intended.} 25. Rg1 Re7 {I'm intending to claim the d file with this rook and then begin applying pressure to the white king.  I would not have the opportunity to do so.} 26. h5 {I'm not sure what this move was for.  I believe it was a mistake.  It allows capture of the pawn.  Even though I potentially surrender an open g file on the king, I gain more material in the process and the white g pawn is still an effective blocker.} gxh5 27. Rxh5 {This subsequent recapture illustrates the mistake of advancing the h pawn.  It allows capture of the defenseless f pawn.} Rxf3+ {Now I have a 2 to 1 pawn advantage on the King side and a 4 to 3 advantage on the Queen side.  I am solely focused on trading down material now.} 28. Kc2 {I think Kd2 would have been better, protecting against Re2.} Re2+ 29. Kb1 Rff2 {Doubling the Rooks on the 2nd rank} 30. g6 {Mistake.  Better would have been Rgh1 doubling the rooks on the h file to apply pressure on the h pawn.} hxg6 {Now I'm feeling better about this.  I have a good pawn structure on the King Side and doubled rooks threatening white's remaining pawns and king.} 31. Rxc5 {It was only a matter of time before white dismantled the extremely weak tripled pawns.  I've resigned to the fact that all my Queen Side Pawns are done for, I just have to make sure that I get all of white's queen side pawns in the process.  Leaving me +2 for the endgame.} Rexa2 {One pawn down.} 32. Rxc6 {Continues the dismantling.} Rab2+ 33. Kc1 {2 pawns down} Rxb3 34. Rxa6 {Mistake.  White should have taken the final c pawn.  By moving the rook to the a file white has surrendered his last pawn.} Rc3+ 35. Kb1 Rxc4 {+3 and a good King side pawn structure makes me feel good about this game.} 36. Ra8+ Kg7 37. Ra6 Rcf4 {I'm not really concerned about my c pawn.  It will not be a factor in the endgame.} 38. Rc6 Rf2f1+ {Eliminating a rook.} 39. Rxf1 Rxf1+ 40. Kc2 f5 {Begin the pawn advance.  Having connected pawns is a huge advantage in this end game.} 41. Rxc7+ Kh6 {The focus for me is to always place my King where the pawns are protected and it is difficult to be placed in check.} 42. Kd2 {A good move.  My focus now is to keep the White King out of the end game.  At this point I'm not sure that I can do it.} Rf4 43. Rc3 {This was the final mistake that allowed me to seal up the win.  Better would have been Ke3.} Re4 {This move shuts the White King out of the rest of the game.  Had white played Ke3 on move 43 the subsequent moves would have been 43...Re4+  44. Kf3 or Kf2 and the White King would have been a major factor in the end game.  It is now isolated on the Queen side and is a bystander for the endgame.  White's only choice here is to trade rooks and hope for a stalemate.  White does not do this and the result is inevitable.} 44. Rh3+ Kg7 45. Kd3 Kf6 46. Rh6 Kg5 47. Rh3 Kg4 48. Rh6 g5 {All pieces protected.  Continue the advance.} 49. Rf6 {Trying to get me to make the blunder f4.} Kf4 50. Rf8 {White has dwindling hopes.} g4 51. Rg8 Kf3 52. Rg5 f4 53. Rh5 g3 54. Rh1 Re3+ 55. Kd2 Kf2 {I now control both Queening squares for the pawns.} 56. Rh3 g2 {Game winning move.  Rook protected by the f pawn and g pawn ready for promotion.  White seeing this resigned.  It was a good game with opportunity for learning on both sides.  Please feel free to comment if you notice any glaring mistakes or blunders.} 57. Rh2 {}
