1. d4 {This game in few words:  - crazy sharp opening,  - fast exchanges in the middle game,  - slow maneuverability on the endgame.   I eventually created a passed and well advanced c pawn, but white had enough counterplay to prevent me from promoting it, even threatened promoting his own pawn with check, so I forced a three fold repetition to end in a safe draw (white could only prevent this by playing a weakening move), and sent a draw offer...} d5 {I was expecting Nf3, and was prepared to play the line 1...h6 2.e4 d6} 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 e5 {the idea behind this is that if white captures, I'll exchange queens and try and endgame with queen side majority, plus those doubled central pawns will certainly impair white's bishops somewhat...} 4. Nf3 exd4 5. Bxc4 {white chooses the main line, I'll reply with Nc6, the best for black in my opinion, develops a piece and protects d4, eventually I'll play Be6 and if white exchanges I'll try to get d4 supported by playing e5} Nc6 {now one of two viable options, Qb3 or 0-0} 6. O-O Be6 {offers the exchange as planed, now white either exchanges or tries Bb5...} 7. Nbd2 {!? interesting rare move} Qf6 {prepares the long castle, develops and defends d4, eventually latter I'll need the prophylactic h6, preventing a future Bg5} 8. Bb5 Nge7 {and I've achieve an equal yet dynamic game, with this move I've added several conditionals... as I believe white will play next, Nb3 (the purpose of playing Nbd2)  a) 9. Nb3 Bg4 10. Nbxd4 O-O-O, I'm hoping for this one, yet I think the other two are more likely to be played... b) 9. Nb3 Bg4 10. Qxd4 Bxf3 11. Qxf6 gxf6 12. gxf3 O-O-O, with almost completed development and open lines on white's king c) 9. Nb3 Bg4 10. Qxd4 Bxf3 11. gxf3 Qxf3 12. Rd1 Qg4+ threatening a draw by repetition} 9. Nb3 Bg4 10. Qxd4 {possible due to the pin on the c6 knight} Bxf3 11. Qxf6 gxf6 12. gxf3 {all expected natural replies until here} O-O-O {castled on opposed wings I can attack white's king with more security of my own king} 13. Kh1 {?! to avoid Rg8? White could have waited, as Kh1 just weakens f2} a6 {forcing a move back} 14. Be2 h5 {controls g4 and allows me to play Bh6 at any point supported by my rook} 15. Bd2 Bh6 {and now I expect Bc3} 16. Be3 {why Bd2?? if Bc3 was not intended...} f5 {offering another pawn in exchange for white's tripled pawns, that will get him a bit cramped} 17. Rad1 Bxe3 {he refused the kind offer, so I'll exchange bishops to deny white the bishop pair and next I'll bring the knight to the center in a conjugated effort to get some material or positional benefict} 18. fxe3 Ne5 19. exf5 {now he decides to exchange pawns} Nxf5 20. Rxd8+ {and rooks} Rxd8 21. e4 {forced or white would lose a pawn} Ne3 {maneuvering to get to c4 with tempo, my knight now can work in tandem to inflict more damage} 22. Re1 Ne3c4 23. f4 {?! now I can force the exchange of white's bishop by one of my knights} Nd3 {now forced is Bxd3 Rxd3, or white will lose one pawn} 24. Bxd3 {forced} Rxd3 25. Nc5 {now I see a mate threat as white's knight controls d7, he probably intend to might play Rg1 sacrificing a pawn to play next Rg8 mate, can I force the exchange of rooks with Rf3-Ne3-Rf1+ at any point} Rd4 {preparing b6} 26. Re2 b6 {setting a trap on white's knight if Nxa6?? he will be isolated and I have a powerful threat of playing Kb7} 27. Na4 Kd7 {centralizing my king to help in the control of white's most dangerous pawns e4 and f4, now I might try to exchange rooks and proceed in an knight endgame with a pawn majority on the distant wing} 28. Nc3 {condition my a pawn advance by the need to defend against Nb5, while defends e4} Nd6 29. Kg2 f5 {fixating the f4 weakness, before bringing the king to the final position in front of white's passed pawn} 30. e5 {forced} Nc4 {so I was able to fixate white's weak f4 pawn and he is a bit cramped now, I'll try to win more space, but this sure looks drawish, or in a long shot a hard win for black} 31. Kg3 Ke6 {the other option is Rd3+ to win a pawn with Kf2 Nxb2 Rxb2 Rxc3, but I'm not sure about the need for white to play either Kf2 or Rxb2} 32. Rf2 b5 {It serve the purpose of denying a4 to white's knight while I start pushing my pawn majority} 33. Ne2 Rd2 {pinning the knight, and tying the king to the defense of the rook if white wants to lift the pin he has to keep his king near the rook} 34. b3 Ne3 {now I threaten to exchange bishops with Bf1+ Rxf1 Rxe2} 35. Ng1 {white is a lot more limited in his action as he has less space to maneuver} Rd1 {again I choose to bother white's knight} 36. Nf3 c5 {pushing another pawn, the idea is eventually get a passed c pawn, plus adds further control to d4} 37. Re2 Rd3 {defends the knight and threatens a discovered check} 38. Ng5+ {now the discovered check is near, after the forced king move white would need to move his king from the 3rd rank or to put his knight back at f3 to block the discovered check} Ke7 {dominating the knight now he needs three moves to give another check} 39. Nf3 {Rc3 preparing c4} Rc3 {preparing c4} 40. Rf2 c4 {I'll now try to create a passed c pawn} 41. Kh4 Nd1 42. Rf1 Ne3 43. Rf2 Ng4 {white is sturdily defending every square...} 44. Rf1 Rd3 {preventing Rd1 and prepares c3} 45. Kg5 Ke6 {I disliked having white play Kxf5, but then it might have been better to just push the c pawn and forget about my week f pawn anyway} 46. bxc4 {! with this white opened another column, so he has some counter-play, the game is fast heading to a draw} bxc4 47. Nh4 {the f pawn is again at risk, only with counterplay on the other wing can I prevent it from being captured} Ne3 48. Rb1 {of course, as was surly intended with bxc4, now white occupies the open column} c3 49. Rb6+ Kd5 {heading to e4 } 50. Rd6+ Ke4 51. Rc6 Kd5 {now I can force the three fold repetition shifting the king between e4 and d5 or have white play a weakening move so I've sent a draw offer}
