1. d4 {This game by me is by no means a perfect game. However I do play an excellent endgame where I have an advantage in space. Normally, having an advantage in space is not enough to win a game between equals. However, this game shows how to exploit a space advantage and convert it into a winning one. Here is the blueprint for doing that. I learned the following from Alec kine and capablanca who were amazing at exploiting the slightest of space advantages  converting an advantage of space into a win  Step 1: you lock your opponent up. play moves that control more space and constrict your opponent even more. In general avoid exchanges, which usually only help your opponent ease his cramped position.  Step 2: then push him into making a move that creates a weakness. you can do this by squeezing him into such a cramped position that he is forced into playing a move that creates space. However, in so he creates an opening for you to breakthrough. Step 3: you breakthrough with a sacrifice. Normally this does involve a sacrifice to breakthrough. However, open lines for your pieces then that is good too.  } d5 2. c4 c6 {Semi-slav has become popular recently because of ...a6} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 a6 {black will try and seek counter chances through b5.} 5. Bd3 Bg4 {...dxc4 is also playable by black. } 6. Nbd2 {defending against the possible capture on f3. I aim to capture back with my knight so that I do not create any pawn weaknesses. Plus I also defend c4.} e6 7. O-O Nbd7 8. b3 {this is quiet move that supports c4. } Bd6 9. Bb2 {playing the immediate c5-c4 would release the tension in the center. Which is to black's favor.} O-O 10. Qc2 {preparing to open things up along the c-file} Qb8 11. Rac1 Re8 12. Rfe1 a5 {takes control of b4 for a possible outpost for the dark bishop.} 13. a3 {a necessary move to prevent ...Bb4. The drawback is that I have a backward B-pawn.} Bh5 14. h3 {taking the opportunity to deny black the use of the g4 square. As you can see black is slowly becoming more and more cramped.} Rf8 {So far black is refusing to commit himself on either side. } 15. Rcb1 {I continue to add support to my plan of opening up the queenside.} Qc7 16. c5 {I make the first committal move of the game. By doing so I deny black the optimal b8-h2 diagonal for his bishop at the price of sealing the c-file. This ensures that I have a enduring space advantage. Now all I have to do is slowly force black into creating a weakness. } Be7 17. Ne5 Kh8 {...Nxe5 is playable but white would have a clear advantage on the kingside.} 18. Ndf3 {Now I am assured that I will have a knight on e5. Which will make black's already cramped position even more unbearable. } Nxe5 19. Nxe5 {Things are looking good for me. I now have a nice outpost for my knight. } Nd7 {Black must challenged the Knight on e5} 20. Rec1 Rad8 {I was excepting ...Nxe5 but black seems to not want to commit to a single plan. Let us see if I can make him pay} 21. b4 {This neutralizes the queen side.} Rda8 22. Bc3 axb4 23. axb4 {I have a mobilized queen side pawns and easily crack things open with a well timed b4-b5.} Bf6 24. f4 {adding support to e5 and grabbing more space on the king side. Playing f2-f4 opens up the possibles of shift my attack to the king side via QF2} Bh4 {Preventing white from shifting his queen to the king side via f2} 25. Bxh7 {taking amount to expose the black king by removing one of his gaurds} f5 26. Ng6+ {Not 26. Bg6 because of  26. ...Nxe5 27. Bxh5 Nc4! 28. Qe2 g5 29. Rf1 Ra3 and black has a good game. } Kxh7 27. Nxh4 {Black has survived the first round of attacks. My knight is kinda out of play on h4. It will take me sometime to build another attack. I have managed to create some serious holes in black's defense and black still remains cramped.} Rfg8 {I would think ...Nf6 is more useful} 28. b5 {opening up the b file for use of my rooks} g5 {The point of Rg8 is to play this move. However, White can safely open the g-file and go up another pawn. Notice how black is not attempting to create space for his pieces. This is a result of my play to force black into a cramped position. Often times when you force your opponent into a cramped position they feel compelled to make drastic moves like this one in order to create breathing space. This however, is a double edge sword as it creates more problems then it solves.  } 29. fxg5 Rxg5 30. Qf2 {the queen is going to F4 to gain an iron grip on the dark sqaures. } Nf6 {This is a move that black should played a long time ago. However, it is now a little too late} 31. Qf4 Qg7 {Because of white's superior piece mobility and space advantage the queen exchange would be to his advantage so black rightly avoids it. } 32. Rc2 {Ensuring that g2 is well defended and prepares to double the rooks on the b- file} cxb5 {another seriously weakening move that hands the game to white on a silver platter. } 33. Rxb5 Ne4 34. Ra5 {a great in between move that defends the bishop in style. White defends the bishop by attacking the undefended a8 rook and gains control of the a-file. } Rc8 35. Be1 {From here the bishop dominates the knight.} Qf6 {Black is completely tied down and is at the mercy of white to end his misery. Lets finish him off. } 36. Rb2 {There is no way black can defend the pawn.} Rg7 37. Rb6 {White has finally broken through Black's defense. Black can not longer plug all the holes.} Rc6 38. Rxc6 bxc6 39. Ra6 {If you have a space advantage heading into the endgame the rule of thumb is to exchange pieces not pawns.} Be8 {black is all tied down again.} 40. Ra8 Ng5 {...Ng5 defends the bishop because of: 41. RxB ...Nxh3 !} 41. Bg3 {This breaks the communication of black's rook and knight so that if Nh3+ white can capture the knight without any worries. } Rg8 42. Qc7+ Qf7 43. Qxf7+ Nxf7 44. Nf3 Kh6 {Black can not play Rxb because with the enemy rook behind his pawns it would over very quickly} 45. Kf2 Kg6 46. Bh4 Kg7 47. Ra7 Rh8 48. Re7 Kf8 49. Rxe6 Bd7 50. Re7 Be8 51. Rc7 Kg8 52. Be7 Kg7 53. Nh4 Nh6 54. Bd6+ Kg8 55. Kg3 Rh7 56. Rc8 Kf7 57. Nf3 Rg7+ 58. Kf4 Rg8 59. Ne5+ Ke6 60. Nxc6 Bd7 61. Rxg8 Nxg8 62. Nd8+ Kf6 63. c6 Bc8 64. g4 fxg4 65. hxg4 Kg6 66. g5 Ba6 67. c7 Nf6 68. gxf6 {black resigns because he can not stop the pawn storm.}
