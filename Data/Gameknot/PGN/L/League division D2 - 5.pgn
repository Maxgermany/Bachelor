1. e4 {This is a league match, when I was challenged my opponent was around 200 points north of my rating so I was expecting a tough match and that is what I got.} e5 2. f4 {I've recently played in a Kings Gambit tournament with mixed results however I really enjoyed it so I thought I would give it a go here. I was hoping it would take my opponent to less secure territory} exf4 3. Bc4 {This is the bishops gambit variation} Nf6 {bishop's gambit, Bogolyubov variation} 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 d6 6. d4 Bg4 7. Bxf4 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. b4 {This is a mistake} Nxb4 10. a3 Nc6 11. Rb1 Na5 12. Ba2 {The bishop limits the options for the black knight which is sidelined for the rest of the game, the white lsb is a little more fortunate.} b6 13. e5 dxe5 14. dxe5 Bc5+ 15. Kh1 Nh5 16. Qd5 {This is a blunder, the computer suggests 16. Qxd8 Raxd8 17. Ng5 Nxf4 18. Rxf4 Bh5} Nxf4 17. Qe4 Bxf3 18. Rxf3 Ng6 {The computer calls this a mistake preferring  … Ne6 19. Qf5 Kh8 20. Rh3 g6 21. Qg4 Ng5  However in compensation the computer calls my next 3 moves mistakes} 19. Nd5 {best is  20. Nf4 Nxf4 21. Qxf4 Qe7 22. Rbf1 Rad8 } c6 20. Nb4 {Around this point I started to feel that I had totally lost any grip I had on the game and that I was just being hounded around the board. I looked again and realise that I had the potential for a lot of pressure on the black king, particularly based around the f7 square so I started to put a plan into action in the hope I could do better than lose.} Qc7 21. Rbf1 {Computer prefers  21. Nd3 Rae8 22. e6 Kh8 23. Rh3 Bxa3 } Rad8 {According the the computer this is the last of a sequence of mistakes on both sides} 22. Nd3 {I need to try to eliminate the black dsb as I am looking to get my queen or a rook onto the 8th rank and it seems to be one defender too many for me to get through. if it's not moved then I will get the added benefit of doubling black pawns and isolating the a pawn which could be useful if we get to an end game} Rd7 23. e6 {The computer says this is an innacuracy preferring 23. Nxc5 Re7 24. e6 f6 25. Nd7 Rd8 26. Rh3 Nb7} Re7 {The computer calls this a blunder, as I see it, it doesn't really achieve much. The threat on my queen is not really there.} 24. exf7+ Rexf7 {This is a blunder as the rook is now pinned which also limits the options for the rook on f8. The computer suggests … Kh8 25. Qxg6 Re3 26. Rxe3 Bxe3 27. Qe6 Bd4} 25. Rf3xf7 {I was not clear on my best option here, I wanted to take with my lsb but in the end I figured that this was more forcing.} Rxf7 {The computer calls this a blunder and proposes mate in 7 which I will leave as an exercise for the reader} 26. Bxf7+ {This is a blunder as it's not part of the mate in 7 routine however I had now regained all the material I had lost earlier and was sure I could gain some more.} Kh8 {the computer prefers … Qxf7 27. Rxf7 Kxf7 28. Nxc5 Nf8 here} 27. Nxc5 {finally it's time to get rid of that pesky bishop, black is in real trouble now, the knight can't be taken due to Qe8+ though the computer declares mate in 12 here} bxc5 28. Qe8+ {and black resigned.  I was delighted with this game but think I had a very lucky escape. I started badly then a series of blunders in the middle game on both sides threw it into some disarray and I was able to improve the co ordination of my pieces to apply a lot of pressure around the black queen}
