1. f3 {this move was very confusing to face. It does not help development and weakens the e1-h4 diagonal} e5 {i take the center} 2. Kf2 {and now this! however the bad king position can not be exploited yet so i develop} d5 3. e3 Nf6 {we can see that black is much better here. He has 2 pawns in the center and a piece in play} 4. g3 Bd6 5. d4 {white seeks to open up the game but this is wrong as he has no pieces in play} O-O {simple development} 6. c3 Be6 7. Bh3 Nc6 8. Qc2 Qd7 {black has nearly finished his development while white has moved 1 piece, his queen and his king!} 9. Kg2 exd4 {now black opens up the game as his rooks can take the e-file} 10. exd4 Rae8 11. Bg5 Bxh3+ 12. Nxh3 Re6 {preparing to double} 13. Nf4 Bxf4 14. Bxf4 Rfe8 {we can now see the problems with white's position. Re2  is the threat and his rook and knight are not helping} 15. Kf2 {If Nd2 then Re2  with a decisive invasion of the 1st and 2nd ranks} Qe7 {Re2  is the threat again} 16. Bd2 {looks like it stops black's attack as it guards e1 however black now has a decisive conbination} Re2+ 17. Kf1 Re1+ {! with this exchange sacrifice black invades the 1st and 2nd ranks} 18. Bxe1 Qxe1+ 19. Kg2 Re2+ {looks like it wins the queen...} 20. Kh3 {however if Rxc2 then Rxe1} Qf2 {but now the white king is forced out into the open. The threats are Rxc2 and Qg2 } 21. Qd1 Qg2+ 22. Kh4 h6 {! the g5 square is taken away from the king. g5# is the threat} 23. f4 {the only move} Qxh2+ {!!} 24. Rxh2 Rxh2# {mate. This game shows how to play against unorthodox openings: develop!!}
