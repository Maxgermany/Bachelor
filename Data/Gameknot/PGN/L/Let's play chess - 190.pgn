1. e4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 {This is a typical position from the Owen Defense.  } 3. d5 {This is not typical.  More often White continues development.} c6 4. c4 cxd5 5. cxd5 Nf6 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bb5+ Nfd7 8. Nf3 a6 9. Ba4 b5 10. Bc2 {Black is now somewhat cramped, or at least has poor piece coordination.} g6 11. O-O Bg7 12. Bf4 O-O 13. Rc1 Nf6 14. Re1 Nbd7 15. b4 Ng4 16. h3 Nxf2 {This was crazy.  Bxc3 was the obvious choice.} 17. Qd2 Rc8 18. Bb3 Nxh3+ 19. gxh3 {Black has given up a piece for two pawns, but has insufficient piece coordination to launch an assault on the exposed White King.} Nf6 20. e5 Nh5 21. Bh2 Qd7 22. e6 fxe6 23. dxe6 Qe8 24. Nd4 {White pieces are wonderfully placed.} Rf6 25. Ne4 Bxe4 26. Rxe4 Rxc1+ 27. Qxc1 Qf8 28. Bxd6 Kh8 {exd6 runs into e7+, losing the Queen.} 29. Be5 Qd8 30. Nc6 Qd3 31. Bxf6 Qxe4 32. Bxg7+ Kxg7 {White is significantly better here and only has to worry about King safety.} 33. Qc3+ Kh6 34. Qd2+ Nf4 35. Bd5 {This is a good move.  Moving the Queen off the second rank might have allowed Black to play Qg2#.} Qf5 36. Nxe7 Qg5+ 37. Kh2 Nxe6 38. Qxg5+ Kxg5 39. Bxe6 Kf6 40. Bc8 {White wins easily by picking off the a- and b-pawns and shepherding one of them to promotion.} Kxe7 41. Bxa6 {}
