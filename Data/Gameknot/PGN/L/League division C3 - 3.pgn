1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 dxe4 5. Nxe4 Nbd7 6. Nf3 h6 7. Bh4 {The world database prefers here Nxf6+} c5 8. Nxc5 {This move does not seem very consistent with white's attacking setup. c3 seems the move to go, and black must go with Be7.} Nxc5 9. dxc5 Qa5+ 10. c3 Qxc5 11. Bd3 Bd6 12. O-O Bd7 13. Qe2 Nh5 14. Rfe1 Nf4 {After a very long series of very logical moves, black has to make a fundamental choice. An interesting plan would be to start a kingside attack with g5 and trading the white's black bishop. Black decides to go for the trading of white's white bishop, which seems inferior, since the white bishop seems to be neutralized in this variant.} 15. Qc2 Nxd3 16. Qxd3 Bb5 17. Qd2 {White dreams of continuing his attacking plan. It would have been better to trade queens.} O-O 18. Qd4 {What he does now.} Qc7 19. Bg3 {It is not clear why white would like to change the black-square bishops for a double pawn.} Bxg3 20. hxg3 Rfd8 21. Qe5 {The arising endgame is good for black, so maybe was not the right time to trade queens.} Qxe5 22. Rxe5 Bc6 {Actually it is more important to protect the e6 pawn to play f6, so Bd7 woulda have been better.} 23. Nd4 Bd5 24. a3 {White does not have a clear plan, so he places pawns on white squares, allowing a good continuation to black.} Kf8 {But black misses it! After 24. ... f6 25. Re2 e5 26. Nf3 Bc6 black dominates the d-file, has an intact pawn structure, and a strong bishop.} 25. Rae1 Rac8 26. g4 a6 27. f4 Ke7 28. Kf2 Kd6 29. g3 g6 30. g5 {Bad move. The endgame should be draw, but white decide to give black the h-file for get rid of the doubled pawns. After R5e2 nothing will happen.} hxg5 31. Rxg5 Rdh8 32. Nf3 Bxf3 {Too early. White has no counterplay at the moment, so black can use some time in playing b5-Rh7. If white want to occupy the e-file again, black can play f6-e5} 33. Kxf3 Rh2 34. Re2 Rxe2 35. Kxe2 Rc5 {Black hopes to win the pawn endgame, but he is wrong. 35. ... Rh8 would have been more testing.} 36. Rxc5 Kxc5 37. Kd3 b5 38. g4 a5 39. b4+ axb4 40. axb4+ Kd5 41. g5 Kc6 {At this point black loses the thread: 41. ... Kc6 is losing (according to SF5 Mate in 31) since black cannot play e5 and make an own free pawn. The game would still have been draw after 41. e5 42. fxe5 Kxe5 43. c4 f5 44. cxb5 Kd6 and now neither of the kings can support the own free pawn.} 42. Ke4 Kd6 43. Kd4 Kc6 44. Ke5 Kd7 45. Kf6 {Now is white's turn to lose the thread. White seems not notice that the threat of making a free pawn with c4 is winning and try to capture black's kingside pawns.} Ke8 46. Kg7 Ke7 {Now the game is still drawn. If black move the f pawn, it loses the g pawn and the game. So white must only have threaten the g pawn...} 47. Kg8 {... but white decides to go with the king to g8 to keep the f-pawn under control.} e5 {This is again a blunder. Consulting nalimov tablebase shows that all resulting pawn endgames are draw. The winning line was: 47. ... f5!! 48. c4 (if Kg7, now e5 can be played since one of the f or e pawn is fast enough) bxc4!! (e5 draws since the resulting free pawn is too late) 49. b5 c3 50. b6 Kd7 and wins.} 48. fxe5 Ke6 49. Kg7 Kxe5 50. Kxf7 Kf5 51. Ke7 Kxg5 52. Kd6 Kf5 53. Kc5 {The final mistake in the endgame is done by white. 53. Kd5 would have drawn since after c4, if black does not capture, white can promote the c-pawn with check, and then chase the black king until queen are exchanged and then win by capturing the b-pawn.} g5 54. Kxb5 g4 55. c4 g3 {}
