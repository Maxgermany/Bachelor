[Opening "KGA (C35), Cunningham, Euwe defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {The King's Gambit, currently my usual opening as white.} exf4 3. Nf3 Be7 {The Cunningham Defence. This happens to be also my favourite defence against the King's Gambit, so we were reading from the same script.} 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. e5 Ng4 6. O-O {The immediate d4 is perhaps more popular.} Nc6 7. d4 d5 8. exd6 e.p. Bxd6 {The most common move, though Gallagher regards Qxd6 as more accurate.} 9. Qe1+ Kf8 {The exchange of queens is said to give white a good endgame, despite his pawn down.} 10. Nc3 Nb4 11. Bb3 g5 {I was expecting Bf5 here; I can't remember what I had prepared against it, but had given it a lot of thought. However, black opts not to pursue the attack on c2. The move he plays is a bit risky given the open centre.} 12. a3 {The black knights will now be driven back with loss of time.} Nc6 13. h3 Nh6 {The retreat to f6 is impossible because of Nxg5.} 14. Ne4 Be7 15. d5 {Driving the knight right back to the back rank.} Nb8 {Black's position is looking very passive, though cracking it open does not prove to be an easy task.} 16. Bd2 {White completes his development.} Rg8 17. Rd1 Nf5 18. Bc1 {Keeping an eye on e3 without getting in the way of the rook. An eventual redeployment to b2 is also contemplated.} h6 19. c4 {While sacrificial ideas such as g3 came into consideration at this point, I decided to continue to develop my positional advantage.} b6 20. Ne5 Qe8 21. Qc3 {Defending the knight from the discovered attack and positioning the queen on the long diagonal.} Qd8 22. Rfe1 f6 23. Ng4 Rg6 {Passive, but not so easy to dislodge.} 24. Ba4 {Pinning the bishop with the threat of Re8 .} Nd6 25. Nxd6 {Forcing an isolated pawn.} cxd6 {Not Bxd6? otherwise Re8 .} 26. Nh2 {The knight will re-emerge at the right moment.} Bd7 27. Bc2 Rg7 28. b3 {The dark-squared bishop can redeploy along the a3-c1 diagonal, now that the black knight has gone from f5..} Qc8 29. Bb2 Bd8 30. Qf3 {Heading for the weak light squares on the king's side.} Bf5 31. Bxf5 Qxf5 32. Re6 Be7 {The bishop is forced into defensive duty again.} 33. Rde1 Nd7 34. Qh5 Ne5 35. Qxh6 Qg6 36. Ng4 {Coaxing the black knight away from e5, as 36. ...Qxh6 37.Nxh6 followed by 38.Nf5 would be awkward for black.} Nxg4 37. Qxg6 Rxg6 38. hxg4 Re8 39. a4 Kf7 40. Ba3 {Keeping the black bishop tied down to a passive position.} Rgg8 {This manouevre was all to defend the e8 rook, thus unpinning the bishop.} 41. Kf2 {White feints to attack down the h-file. In fact he has conceived the surprising plan of swapping off all his active pieces and strong d-pawn for black's passive pieces and weak d-pawn. Reason: the resulting pawn ending should be won for white. The preliminaries include improving the position of the white king, while blackÂ´s cramped position forces him to sit and watch.} Rgh8 42. Kf3 Rhf8 {I think this was to free the king from the defence of the f-pawn, anticipating a white king march.} 43. Re1e4 {A final precaution against the black rook invading down the e-file.} Rfg8 44. Bxd6 {And now here we go.} Bxd6 45. Rxd6 Rxe4 46. Kxe4 Re8+ 47. Re6 {Black was probably not expecting this, but I had recognized that it was necessary to stop the black rook getting to e3. Black now has an unpleasant choice; an equal pawn ending which will be decided by white's c-pawn, or a rook ending where white's strong extra d-pawn will probably prove decisive.} Rxe6+ 48. dxe6+ Kxe6 49. b4 {Mobilizing the queen's side majority.} Kd6 {Letting white's king in among the king's side pawns.} 50. Kf5 Ke7 51. c5 bxc5 52. bxc5 a5 53. c6 Kd6 54. Kxf6 Kxc6 55. Kxg5 Kd6 56. Kxf4 Ke6 57. Kg5 Kf7 58. Kh6 Kg8 59. g5 Kh8 {And immediately 1-0.  There is no chance of a stalemate.}
