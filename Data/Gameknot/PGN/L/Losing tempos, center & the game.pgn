1. e4 {This game is a typical Rui Lopez'game (Ruy Lopez, Closed, Chigorin Defense).  Both players will start a well kown line without any exchange  In the early middle game agmac(Black) will start to lose several tempos using his N. High(White) will therefore increase his influence on the center, strengthening d5 and the whole chess board. Let's see what happened!} e5 {e4 e5 looks like an open game is taking place } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 {Ba4 refuses the straight exchange.} Nf6 {Here we have a couple of good moves for blacks among them: Ne7/ Bc5 (even Bb4)/ b5 was expected / f5 is possible / Nd4 ... they are typical anyway.} 5. O-O Be7 {Nxe4 is still acceptable. Now I guess that agmac didn' t want to open up the game against a 2300  player.  not this way, At least.} 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 Na5 {we follow the line...} 10. Bc2 c5 11. d4 Qc7 {I didn't study the exchange on d4. the thing is d4 is willing to get control of c6 and e6 and hold a firm center.} 12. d5 {(Martin Christoffel vs Laszlo Szabo - 1946 - 0-1. looks similar to this position.)} Nc4 {After the 12th moves, odds are in favor of white: win  -  draw - lost% 37.5 -  41.7 - 20.8 According to me: Nc4 is the first waste of time for blacks towards his central attack.} 13. b3 Nb6 14. a4 {a4 was meant to be played somehow early in the middle game. here a b4 answer would have killed the black.} Bd7 {Bd7 could draw the game in 54.7% of the cases.} 15. a5 {a5 is quite surprising for agmac as he loses tempo again with the same N. He will now look for paths. Besides a5 is  safe and allow c4 later} Nc8 16. c4 {Now c4 reinforces d5. the game is not completely closed. White bishops (Bc1 and Bc2) give nice view on the K's side} Ne8 17. Nc3 Bd8 {Bd8! give place to the N looking for files as we said.} 18. Bd3 Ne7 19. Qc2 Ng6 {Ng6 is the 7th move of this N. more than the 3rd of blaks'move.} 20. Be3 Qc8 {f5 is the target of both players} 21. Ne2 f5 22. exf5 Bxf5 23. Bxf5 Rxf5 24. Nd2 Rf7 25. Ne4 {From now on Ne4 is possible and powerful.} Rb8 26. Qd3 Qd7 27. Reb1 {white have space, squares and many possibilities  b and c files are controled } Qf5 {whereas black create fake threats here} 28. Ne2g3 {an other tempo loss by agmac with a simple Ng3, the Q is back in her quaters.} Qc8 29. Nd2 {Nd2 shows whites intentions to go on the Q's side, scooting c4, b6 and c6 squares. I guess that agmac could have closed the door with a secure b4.} Qd7 30. Nge4 Nf4 31. Bxf4 Rxf4 32. b4 {with b4, High won't let agmac close the Q's side.} cxb4 33. Rxb4 Nc7 34. Nb1 bxc4 35. Rxc4 Nb5 {blacks N normaly in the Rui lopez are really active, as we can see here this N has activity after the 30th move. It will settle in d4} 36. Nbc3 Nd4 37. Ne2 Rb3 {when trying to get ride of this high positioned N (Ne2) balck allow Rb3 threatening the queen which they respond by a calm Nxf4 ...} 38. Nxf4 Rxd3 39. Nxd3 {I was wondering if black have any comb to get a draw.} g5 40. Rb1 {Now the Rs look powerful and N d4 useless...} Kg7 41. Rb8 Be7 42. Ng3 Kf7 43. Nb4 g4 44. Nc6 gxh3 {gxh3 is a last tempo loss by agmac} 45. Nxe7 Qxe7 {Q and K have no place to get safe squares...} 46. gxh3 Qd7 47. Kg2 Qe7 48. Rcc8 e4 49. Rch8 {I think R g8 was better   also even if blacks let Q for the Rs that won't help them in this issue.}
