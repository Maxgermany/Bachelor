1. d4 {I won't anotate the whole game, very classical queen gambit play} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 Bb4+ 5. Bd2 Bxd2+ 6. Nbxd2 O-O 7. Bg2 c6 8. Qc2 Nbd7 9. O-O b6 10. e4 dxe4 11. Nxe4 c5 12. Nxf6+ Qxf6 13. Ne5 Rb8 14. Nc6 Rb7 15. Ne5 Nxe5 16. dxe5 Qxe5 17. Bxb7 Bxb7 18. f3 Qe3+ 19. Qf2 Qg5 20. Rad1 Qf6 21. Rd7 Rb8 22. Rfd1 h6 23. Rd1d3 a5 24. Qe2 Ba6 25. b3 {White has a slight advance but a weak king and all his pieces are on white squares, vulnerable to a LSB attack. White controls the open file but the black pieces on the queen side are dangerous.} b5 {good move, white cannot take} 26. Rd3d1 {Rook of the bishop fireline and preventing a further Qa1} bxc4 {good move If white takes : 27. bxc4 ; 27... Rb2 and white is in serious trouble} 27. Ra7 {So that white decides not to take} Bb7 {menacing to take the f3 pawn.} 28. Kf2 {to protect f3 but the white royal pair is subject to a further Rb2 and the white queen will be lost.} Bd5 {puting pressure on b3 and f3} 29. Rxa5 {A free pawn is not somthing to neglect} cxb3 {Now white is in serious trouble} 30. axb3 {Forced move} Rxb3 {Black has several menaces : Rxf3+  Bxf3 and Rb2 are equally dangerous. But this move is a mistake. White has only one move but it's the beginning of a winning sequence and I was very happy to have found it 2 moves before.} 31. Rxd5 {! This annihilates the attack on f3 and if 31... Rb2 ; 32. Rd2 does the job.} exd5 {Black takes and has now material advantage but not for long.} 32. Ra8+ {! Black has only one move available} Kh7 {only move - the black rook hangs} 33. Qc2+ {fork attack} g6 {33... Qg6 was another option, not better.} 34. Qxb3 {Now white has a material advantage. Black's only hope is to promote one of the passed pawns but white's winning sequence is not finished.} c4 {Only 3 squares before promotion.} 35. Qb8 {Mating menace. Black has only one move.} Qd4+ {Clever, for it forces the white king to go away from  the center where it could block the passed pawns.} 36. Kg2 {king in safety. Not that black cannot hope for permetual chess because the white king can go to h3} Qg7 {only move to avoid the mate} 37. Qf8 {forcing the queen exchange} Qb2+ {to fire the white king further away} 38. Kh3 {King in safety} Qg7 {only movz} 39. Qxg7+ {exchanging the queens} Kxg7 40. Rd8 {It's over.}
