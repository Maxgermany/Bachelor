1. d4 {I played as black in this game. I'm still trying to learn the basics of the Kings Indian, and won this game because of sheer luck. Of course, I'd rather not like to win this way, and would like any input you guys can give.} Nf6 {A flexible response. I can still go d5 and transpose if I wish, as well as do many other things.} 2. c4 {I'm not grabbing the center, so he is.} g6 {Preparing Bg7.} 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {Here, he can't play e5, because after the exchanges, his knight will have had to move backward, losing time. } 5. Nf3 {I debated Bg4 here. However, White could just kick it away with h3, since Bh5 loses the Bishop.} O-O {This seemed more natural to me.} 6. Be2 {I would say Bd3 is better, but my f7 g6 h7 pawn formation seems to make that less appealing. The LSB for white seems a bit useless for the time being.} e5 {While it looks like this loses a pawn, I don't think it does because after dxe5, dxe5, Nxe5, Nxe4! With a discovered attack on the e5 Knight.} 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Bg5 {This came as a shock to me. I think the best move here would have just been to move the rook, seeing what happened.} Nbd7 {Instead, I developed another piece, which seems fine.} 10. O-O-O {And now he's threatening Nxe5, since my knight on d7 is pinned.} Re8 {I thought this fixed the problem, but it invites whites next move.} 11. Nb5 {I didn't see this move, and it benefits white in the end.} Nxe4 12. Nxc7 Rf8 {I didn't want to let him have my more active rook.} 13. Nxa8 Nxf2 14. Nc7 Nxh1 {This will at least slow him down a little.} 15. Rxh1 f6 {My only chance here was to try and push the e pawn. Sadly, I think this position is probably lost for black at this point, with proper play.} 16. Be3 b6 17. Rd1 {A better move here I thought was Ne6, gaining the Bishop pair. Also, his extended Knight could be a liability.} Nc5 {After doing the calculations, white doesn't win a pawn here after Bishop takes.} 18. Bxc5 bxc5 19. Rd5 Rf7 {Now, if Rxc5, I hav Bf8. and if Rc6, I have Bb7, winning a piece.} 20. Rd8+ Rf8 {Forced.} 21. Rxf8+ Kxf8 22. Nd2 {With looks at Ne4 and Nb3. Both look very good, attacking the c5 pawn.} Bh6 {Giving new life to the DSB. This bishop is going to be my savior, since it can't be challenged easily.} 23. Kc2 {Getting out of the pin.} f5 {I need to move as quick as possible.} 24. Nb3 Be3 {And the pawn will hold, at least for now.} 25. Kd3 Bg1 {I didn't plan on taking with Bxh2 here. I don't want that c pawn to become passed. Also, white will have too much activity after Nxc5.} 26. h3 {He played this anyway. I guess he didn't like the tactics or something.} Kf7 {Covering the e6 Square, so my LSB can move.} 27. Nb5 {Threatens Nxa7 and Nd6+} Ke6 28. Nxa7 {I'm down 3 points now... and he has a passed pawn too.} Bb7 29. Bf3 {This was probably the main reason I won. One blunder can cost the game some times.} e4+ 30. Ke2 exf3+ 31. gxf3 {He still is up a pawn, but I have too much activity now.} Ke5 32. Nb5 Kf4 33. Nd2 Be3 34. Nd6 Bc6 35. b3 Bxd2 36. Kxd2 Kxf3 37. a4 Kg3 {He resigned here. Let me know what you guys think, and give me lots of pointers! :D Oh, and if anyone wants to play me as white and play the kings Indian, rated or unrated, message me or challenge me and I'll play. It has to be the Kings Indian though! lol}
