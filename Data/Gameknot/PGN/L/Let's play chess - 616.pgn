[Opening "King's pawn game (C44)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Probably the most commonly seen opening through 2 moves.} 3. a3 {This is an interesting variant.} Nf6 4. Nc3 Bc5 {Both sides continue to develop.} 5. b4 Bd4 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 {The first exchange of the game.} 7. Nb5 Nxb5 8. Bxb5 O-O {My K-side is developed: now I need to activate my Q-side.} 9. d3 d6 10. Bg5 h6 {Immediately "putting the question".} 11. Bh4 {White dodges it for now, and I'm certainly not going to open up my own King's position with P-KN4.} a6 12. Bc4 Be6 {If White captures, I will have a half-open KB file for my KR to use. Of course, I would have to unpin my KN first so I could clear the decks.} 13. O-O Bxc4 14. dxc4 {Instead, I capture and force him to double his Pawns.} b6 15. f4 exf4 16. Rxf4 {A mistake. Apparently White didn't see the Pawn fork.} g5 {This exposes my King in a dangerous manner, but I figure it's worth the gamble to win a piece.} 17. Bxg5 hxg5 18. Rf5 {Now I really have to be alert defensively. The game is getting very tactical.} Nxe4 {Guards the Pawn, preventing RxP ch.} 19. h4 Qd7 {Counterattack on the Rook.} 20. Qg4 {Double attack. The correct response is 20...Q-K2. } Rae8 {Overlooking the fact that after the Rook captures, my Q is unguarded,} 21. Rxg5+ Nxg5 22. Qxd7 {I still have a fighting chance, with a Rook and Knight against a Queen and Pawn. The ending is a technical win for White, but I can put up a lot of resistance.} Ne6 23. Re1 Red8 {Driving the Queen back.} 24. Qa4 Rda8 {Everything is still guarded.} 25. Re4 Kh7 {Preventing the Rook from checking on the KN file.} 26. c3 a5 27. b5 {This tactical error strengthens my position. I was expecting an exchange of Pawns, which would leave both QR Pawns isolated. Now my Pawn at QB2 can support the entirety of my Q-side Pawn structure.} Rae8 {My Rook can now wander, not being confined to guarding the QRP.} 28. Qc2 Kh8 {A little too obvious by White. I don't usually overlook discovered checks.} 29. h5 Nc5 30. Rxe8 Rxe8 {Now White has just 1 piece left. If I can take his passed KRP off the board, I feel my chances of a draw are excellent.} 31. h6 Re6 {Now White must either defend or advance the Pawn.} 32. Qf5 {He chooses instead to exchange Pawns and start over with a passed KNP.} Rxh6 33. Qxf7 {I have to be careful. I must protect the QBP, but 33...R-R2??? is answered by 34 Q-B8 mate. So I defend with my Knight instead, which in turn is guarded by the Rook.} Ne6 {At this point, White's best strategy might well be to try and run me out of moves by stalling with the King for a bit. Instead, he makes a monumental blunder.} 34. Qxc7 {Oops! It's been a very long time since I've been involved in a game where both my opponent and I blundered away our Queens in the same game. Unlike me, however, he gets no material compensation. } Nxc7 {Obvious. White resigns.}
