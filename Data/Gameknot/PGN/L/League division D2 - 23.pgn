[Opening "King's knight opening (C40)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bd6 {A bad move; Black voluntarily blocks his d-pawn to defend his e-pawn.  This makes it hard for him to develop freely (the white sq bishop will have to come to b7 after ...b6 - more lost time).  ...Nc6 is a natural and good move. } 3. Nc3 {Ok; but given Black's lacklustre start, 3.c3, aiming to play d4 with a massive centre looks more ambitious.} c6 {Stops the white knight coming to d5, but at the cost of now blocking the c6 sq for his b8 knight.  Not a great start by Black.  Better would be ...Nc6, hoping for the best.} 4. d3 {A better bet would be 4.d4! Then, if ...exd4 5.Qxd4 (attacking the misplaced bishop on d6) and, if Black protects with 5...Qf6, 6. e5 forks bishop and queen.} h6 {Because White is not challenging the centre (4. d3), Black is allowed to get away with a whole series of inconsequential pawn moves intended to hinder White but at the cost of lots of tempi (moves).} 5. Be2 Bb4 {Realising his earlier error, Black redirects the bishop - abandonning the e5 pawn to its fate (having played d3, White need not worry about ...Qe7 after 6. Nxe5, since his e4-pawn is protected).  Now, if he can get in ...d6, Black may stand ok.} 6. Bd2 {Again, perfectly alright but just Nxe5 is simpler. If Black had replied ...Qa5 (seemingly attacking both the knight on e5 and threatening to take twice on c3) White has the nice interposing move 7. Nc4! attacking the Black Queen.   6. 0-0 would also have been more enterprising, not fearing the doubled pawns after ...Bxc3  7.bxc3 when White could play d4 supported by the new pawn at c3.} b5 {Another curious pawn move.  Hard to see what it's aimed at.  Again, the pawn at e5 is still undefended...} 7. Nxe5 d6 8. Nf3 g5 {Verging on suicide.  Black goes for a k-side pawn storm with only one piece developed.} 9. O-O Nf6 10. a3 {Putting the question to the bishop.  10. a4 would also have been interesting - threatening the b5 pawn  and if 10...bxa4 11.Rxa4 attacking the bishop.} Bxc3 11. Bxc3 {White has a clear advantage now.  He's nearly completed his develpoment and has an akward pin on the f6 knight.} a5 12. b4 {Better was just 12. Re1, aiming for 13. Bf1 and then 14. e5! breaking open the centre.  White had no need to fear the further advance of the b-pawn as the Ra8 is undenfended after 12...b4  13. axb4 ...13 axb4??  Simlarly, if Black is hoping to play ...a4, why not let him?  With Black's king about to get killed there's no need to think about the endgame...} a4 13. d4 {Getting the pawn centre but without first protecting e4.  Re1 followed by Bf1 would have allowed a subsequent d5 without material loss.} Nxe4 14. Bb2 Qf6 15. Bd3 {A good move.  White threatens the knight and also prepares Re1, taking over the e-file.} d5 16. Re1 Bg4 {pinning the knight, but after...} 17. Bxe4 dxe4 18. Rxe4+ Be6 {...the bishop has to retreat to block the check (or be taken).  White has regained the pawn, opened the centre and stands well.} 19. c3 {(?) Horrid move - blocking in that lovely bishop.  The d-pawn was already heavily defended.  Or, why not open up further with 19. d5!? (revealing an attack on the Qf6 from the b2 bishop and simultaneously attacking the bishop on e6).  After 19 ...Qxb2,  20. dxe6 and it's nearly over - so vulnerable is B's king.} O-O {taking the chance to get to (relative) safety.} 20. g3 {(?) Why?  This bad move weakens the white squares around White's king when Black's white-sq bishop is still on the board - hardly ever a good plan.  It also ties W's queen to the defence of the f3 knight (no longer pawn-protected and threatened by B's Qf6).  } Bd5 {Black could now have taken advantage of White's last to force a draw: 20...Bb3 (attacking the queen) 21. Qe2 (White must stay protecting the f3 sq) 21...Bc4  22. Qc2 and 22...Bb3 again etc.} 21. Re3 Nd7 22. Ne5 {Exchanging off the liability.} Nxe5 23. Rxe5 {Having failed to raise an attack, White does - now - need to consider the endgame.  He is a pawn up, but the opposite coloured bishops make a draw probable (since once side will control all the dark sqaures while the other all the light).  White - if he wants to press his negligible advantage, should try to keep the major pieces on the board.  Black though has little to fear now - just look at the difference in the bishops: Black's is posing deadly threats to white's king while White's is hidden behind a mass of his own pawns (that move 19.c3?).} Rfe8 24. Qe2 Rxe5 25. Qxe5 {A bad recapture.  25. dxe5 (leaving the queen back to cover the crucial f3 square) was necessary.} Qf3 {Mate is threatened, so...} 26. Kf1 Qh1+ 27. Ke2 {Suddenly it's White's king that's on the run.  What a turnaround...} Qxh2 {Restoring material equality but now with a big attack.  Black must be careful though.  28...Kf8? (hoping to play ...Re8 and win the white queen) would be bad since it allows Qh8  and White will capture the rook on a8.} 28. Bc1 Kf8 {A mistake - which White misses.  29. Qh8  would give seemingly give White winning chances after ...Ke7 and 30. Qxa8.  But in fact Black is still very much in control after 30....Qh5  (e.g. Kd2 ...Qf3  Qb7  ...Kf6 Bb2 ... Qxf2  and checkmate in 2 moves wherever White goes!)  For this reason, White should play first 30.Bg5 ! (before capturing the rook), with the ability then to get his rook into the game in a move or so's time.  Black can't take on g5 (30...hxg5??) as his Queen would be en pris on h2. } 29. Be3 {Going - perhaps wisely - for safety first.} Re8 30. Qd6+ Re7 {Not the best - Kg7 would have been much better.  Now White could - and probaly should - try for a draw by repetition by 31 Qd8  and, after ...Re8, Qd6  again. } 31. Kd2 {This is more ambitious, but not wrong.  That bishop on e3 is doing an excellent defensive job.} f6 {Bad - the pawn that has advanced can simply be taken - and with check too!} 32. Re1 {Missing the chance to go ahead again.  32. Qxf6  was perfectly playable.} Kf7 {This position is now about level.  Each side's king is a little exposed and so perpetual check leading to a draw is most likely.  However, White has self-destruction in mind...} 33. Bxg5 {(??)  A nice idea, since if ...Rxe1 White plays 34. Qxf6  with at least a draw and more if Black tries to hide with ...Kg8 (instead of ....Ke8), while if 33...hxg5  34. Qxe7  follows and White is doing nicely.  Unfortunately, there is another move Black can play first...} Qxf2+ {(!) Now it really is over.} 34. Kd3 {It's mate whatever White does.} Bc4# {An up and down game:  White failed to capitalise on Black's idiosyncratic opening play, got an advantage despite himself then, whith a couple of innocuous-looking pawn moves (19. c3 and 20. g3) hands complete control to Black.  }
