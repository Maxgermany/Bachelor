1. e4 b6 {I did not have a specific plan with this opening; I just didn't feel like playing standard.} 2. d4 Bb7 {I do like the fact that this allows Black to divert White from King-side development, but of course that comes at the cost of Black's own development.} 3. Nc3 e6 {As I read this opening, it is heavily dependent on bishop threats, so this is the necessary next move.  3. ... d5 could be playable as well but radically changes the feel.  3. ... Nf6 might bring more Alekhine-style concepts into play.} 4. Nf3 {Preparing for e5.} d5 5. e5 Ne7 {On reflection, 5. ... Bb4 would be better, as the black bishop is now cramped and will take work to develop.} 6. Bg5 Nd7 {I thought this looked better than 6. ... Nc6.  Aesthetically, I mean, not chess-wise.  That may or may not be a good reason to make a move.} 7. Bd3 {Clears for castling; why not Bb5 though?  As played the bishop covers f5 against the knight, but the knight can't move.} h6 {Black is already looking to free his position - seven moves in!  Very poor development overall.} 8. Bh4 a6 {Not the best move, but then there isn't one.} 9. O-O b5 10. Ne2 Nb6 {One knight escapes the bind.} 11. b3 {...and has nowhere to go.} Qd7 12. Ne1 Ng6 {The only way to get the bishop out.} 13. Bxg6 fxg6 14. Qd3 Qf7 15. Nf3 Be7 16. Bg3 {The exchange would have favored White: on 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 12. Qxg3 wins a pawn, with check, with minimal damage possible from any counterplay.  On ... Kxe7 Black sacrifices any defensive merit left in his position.} Rc8 17. Nd2 Qf5 18. Qxf5 gxf5 {Both positions now seem about equally bad, but Black's pawn structure is unsound.} 19. Nf4 Kf7 20. h4 c5 21. c3 b4 22. cxb4 cxb4 23. Rac1 a5 24. h5 Bg5 25. Nf3 Ba6 26. Rfe1 Bb5 27. Nh4 Bxf4 28. Bxf4 Rxc1 29. Rxc1 Rc8 30. Ra1 Rc2 31. Be3 Be2 32. f3 a4 {This is really the game-losing error for Black.  Although he does need to get the knight in play, White's knight is almost equally useless.  This throws away the defense of the b-pawn.  A draw might even have been palatable before this move.} 33. bxa4 Nxa4 34. Ng6 Bb5 35. Rb1 Rb2 36. Rxb2 Nxb2 37. Nf4 Na4 38. Bd2 Nc3 39. a3 Ne2+ {Black hopes the bishop will negate the loss of a pawn.} 40. Nxe2 Bxe2 41. axb4 Ke7 42. Kf2 Bc4 43. g4 Bb5 {With a pawn disadvantage on the Queen-side, Black must maintain equality on the other side: 43. fxg4 was necessary.} 44. g5 Kf7 45. gxh6 Kg8 46. hxg7 Kxg7 47. Bg5 Bc4 48. f4 Bb5 49. Kg3 Be8 50. Kh4 Kh7 51. Be7 Kh6 52. Bf8+ Kh7 53. Kg5 Kg8 54. Be7 Kh7 55. h6 Bb5 56. Bf8 Bd7 57. Kf6 Kg8 58. Bg7 Kh7 59. Ke7 Bc8 60. b5 Kg8 61. b6 Kh7 62. b7 Bxb7 63. Kxe6 Kg6 64. Ke7 {Black could have resigned a while ago.}
