1. e4 c6 {I wanted to experiment with the Caro-Kann.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. Nf3 Nd7 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. Qxd3 Ngf6 9. O-O e6 10. Bf4 Be7 11. Rfe1 O-O 12. c4 {I have the typical Caro pawn structure, but I think White is more active here, has more space, and better central control.  I have a lot of work to do.} Nb6 13. b3 Rc8 14. Rad1 c5 {Attempting to break up White's nice center.} 15. Ne4 Nbd7 16. Nd6 Bxd6 17. Bxd6 Re8 18. dxc5 Nxc5 19. Bxc5 Qxd3 {This move has to be played before Rxc5.} 20. Rxd3 Rxc5 21. h3 h6 22. Nd2 Rcc8 23. g3 Rcd8 {The position is a little more even now.} 24. Rxd8 Rxd8 25. Ne4 {Black may even have a slight edge now with control of the d file.} Nxe4 26. Rxe4 Kf8 27. Kg2 Ke7 28. Kf3 Rd2 29. a4 Rd3+ {This is likely to lead to an exchange of Rs.  I need to get my K centralized to fight and also to restrain the White pawns.} 30. Re3 Rxe3+ 31. Kxe3 a5 {Holding back both the a and b pawns.} 32. Kd4 Kd6 33. c5+ Kc6 {Now it's a game of cat and mouse since the Queenside pawns are locked up.  Who can break through on the Kingside?} 34. f3 f6 35. f4 e5+ {This check allow me to snap up the c pawn eventually and then attack the Queenside pawns.} 36. fxe5 fxe5+ 37. Kxe5 Kxc5 {Black has a slight advantage because his K is closer to the opposing pawns.} 38. Kf5 Kb4 39. Kg6 Kxb3 40. Kxg7 Kxa4 41. Kxh6 b5 {4th rank vs. 3rd rank.  I should promote first.} 42. g4 b4 43. g5 b3 44. g6 b2 45. g7 b1=Q 46. g8=Q Qb6+ 47. Kh5 {I think this is a mistake.  White's K needs to be near to promotion square of h8.} Qc5+ 48. Kh4 {I think it's not a good idea for White's K to obstruct the pawn.} Kb4 {My K clears space so the pawn can roll.} 49. Qg4+ {This allows me to exchange Qs.} Qc4 50. Kg3 Qxg4+ 51. hxg4 {4th rank vs. 4th rank.  Both pawns will promote, but I will promote first since I am on the move.} a4 {White resigns.  If both pawns promote to Queens, Black plays Qg1+, skewering K and Q and wins easily.}
