1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bc4 Nc6 5. O-O g6 {A slow system for White.} 6. Bb5 {?! Losing a tempo for a pin over Queenside Knight.} Bg7 7. Re1 O-O 8. Bxc6 {Obviously, if White doesn't take now, it could have no other possibilities since now the Knight isn't pinned anymore.} bxc6 9. e5 Nd5 10. exd6 exd6 11. Nxd5 cxd5 {Personally, I'd prefer Black here. He has a better center and a stronger dark-squared Bishop, along with the Bishop pair. } 12. c3 Bg4 {Weakening White's control of the d4 square.} 13. d4 {Anyway!} cxd4 14. cxd4 Qb6 {Threatening Bxf3 and Qxd4 or Bxd4.} 15. h3 {This move doesn't necessarily lose a pawn, but forces some exchanges that strenghten Black's fianchettoed Bishop.} Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Qxd4 17. Rd1 Qe4 18. Qxe4 dxe4 19. Rxd6 Rfd8 20. Bf4 {? Losing a pawn for no compensation.} Rxd6 21. Bxd6 Bxb2 22. Rb1 Bf6 {With the plan Bf6-d8-b6.} 23. a4 Bd8 24. Kf1 Bb6 25. Ke2 Rd8 26. Bb4 {Threatening a5.} Rd5 27. Rc1 f5 {Eliminating any mating threats against my King.} 28. g3 Rd4 29. Rb1 Rc4 {With the Rc2 threat, gaining decisive material.} 30. a5 Bd4 31. Bd2 {? Allowing a self-pin that is more dangerous than useful.} Rc2 32. Rc1 Ra2 {!? Not allowing White to simplify.} 33. Rc8+ Kg7 34. Rc7+ Kf6 35. Rxh7 {That pawn will turn out to place the Rook too far from the King, but other moves weren't so better for White.} Bc3 36. Rd7 Ke6 37. Rd8 Bxa5 38. Rd4 Rxd2+ 39. Rxd2 Bxd2 40. Kxd2 {Simplifying into a won pawn endgame.} f4 41. h4 fxg3 42. fxg3 Kf5 {}
