1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. d3 e6 {This sort of placid development from White generally leads to positions with easy equality for Black or some slight advantage due to queenside space. There are numerous ways to play them but I've always had a preference to adopt a structure similar to that of a Sicilian Kan} 4. Nf3 a6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Nge7 7. h3 d5 {It looks provocative to expand with d5 before developing either bishop but if there is no clear way for White to punish Black's play he will have instantaneously equalised.} 8. exd5 exd5 {It was a difficult choice between this move and Nxd5. Generally capturing with a piece is the right way to go but I felt that the placement of White's light-squared bishop would require White to spend enough tempi so as to allow Black to untangle his minor pieces and secure a safe place for his king. The mainline I had calculated was a4, Be6, Ng5, Bf5, c3, (the point behind the double bishop move was to play for Nd4) g6. Where White' knight on g5 prevents the bishop from locating there in time to prevent Bg7 and 0-0. } 9. Re1 {Missing the simple tactic oicking up a piece} c4 10. dxc4 dxc4 11. Qxd8+ Nxd8 12. Nd4 {Bxc4 is best where at least Black's queenside pawns are fractured.} cxb3 13. cxb3 Ne6 14. Bg5 {Seemingly a blunder, White starts to throw pieces from this point making most of the game not worth comment to be honest.} Nxd4 15. Bxe7 Bxe7 16. Na3 Be6 17. Rad1 Rd8 18. Re4 {Missing a discovered attack} Nf3+ 19. gxf3 Rxd1+ 20. Kg2 Bxa3 21. Ra4 {Beyond understandable} bxa4 22. bxa3 axb3 23. axb3 Bxb3 24. f4 Ke7 25. f5 Bd5+ 26. f3 Rb8 27. Kg3 Rb3 28. Kg4 Rxf3 29. a4 {Black now has mate in five} Rg1+ 30. Kh4 Rf4+ 31. Kh5 Rxf5+ 32. Kh4 Rf4+ {White resigns in view of Kh5, Bf3#}
