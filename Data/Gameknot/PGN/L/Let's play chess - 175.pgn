[Opening "English opening (A16)"]

1. c4 {Lately I’ve been playing nothing but the English opening.  I’ve found that not only does it offer white good long-term chances in a drawn-out positional battle, but occasionally it offers relatively quick tactical victories if the opponent obliges.} Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. g3 d6 4. Bg2 c6 5. d4 {Opting for a Catalan style of game (but without black’s d5) rather than a more reserved and less ambitious “traditional” English approach with d3.  I like the space advantage and slightly more tactical opportunities presented.} Nbd7 6. Nf3 {Developing, and also trying to keep the tension in the center.  It’s something I’ve been trying harder to do lately, rather than immediately committing in the center and resolving the tension before advantageous or the opponent's plans emerge.} Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. e4 {Since I was allowed to play e4, grabbing even more space and taking even more control of d5, I thought now was the time to do so.} Qc7 9. b3 {Still keeping the tension in the center and also preparing to fianchetto the other bishop.} a6 10. a4 {Maybe this was greedy and perhaps even loosening my queenside, but I wanted to prevent b5 and some queenside counterplay of my opponent.  I really wasn’t sure about this move, but I didn’t think it was horrible.} b6 11. d5 {At this point I thought it was time to begin some sort of “attack”, or at least clarify the center.  I reasoned that if ...cxd, then I would have a very nice center with lots of space there (after exd).  And, if ...c5, I would still have a nice central space advantage with a locked center, allowing me play on the kingside if I wanted it.  I had second thoughts about the placement of my dark-squared bishop and didn't want to commit it yet.  It seemed okay where it was for the moment, exerting some influence on the kingside even though still undeveloped.} cxd5 12. exd5 Bb7 13. Nh4 {Preparing f4 or Nf5, both of which seemed good to me.} Rfe8 14. Nf5 {With the black rook moving to the e-file, I thought the possible opening of the e-file with f4 was no longer quite as attractive, so I went ahead with Nf5, which seemed like a great square for the knight, with multiple possibilities that would create kingside weaknesses to dislodge.} Bf8 15. Re1 {Opposing the black rook and preparing for a possible rook lift and swing to the kingside.} Rad8 16. Qf3 {Preparing for a kingside attack.  I was even considering the possibility of g4 at some point.  I strongly considered the obvious Bg5 but thought it would simply invite h6, putting the question to my bishop and “forcing” the Bishop into taking the Knight, only to be replaced with another Knight (an excellent defender of the kingside).  Since I was really hoping to dislodge any and all kingside knights, I held off, and decided to begin with the queen and perhaps prepare g4-g5.} Nc5 {Although this looks very logical, I think this was a mistake.  I was really hoping for this actually, and was surprised my opponent played it.  Perhaps he just didn’t think there was a lot of danger to his kingside, which does appear well-protected with the knight and bishop, but it turns out that he really isn’t as well-defended as might appear and could have used this knight in the defense.} 17. Bg5 {Now with the knight on d7 no longer supporting it's counterpart, this seemed like a very useful, strong attacking move finally.} Nxb3 {Frankly, I was really shocked by this.  I thought that my opponent would have surely seen the dangers of Bxf6 and might just simply retreat the knight right back to d7 again.  I can’t remember which GM said it, or exactly what he said, but something like “Don’t go looking for baubles on the side of the road when there are more important things going on.”  } 18. Bxf6 {The obvious and most forcing move.  He is now faced with several choices, none of which are all that pleasant.} Nxa1 {I think this was probably the least attractive alternative.  I think maybe gxf6 or even Bc8—to get rid of the knight and at least initiate a double attack—were likely better.} 19. Nxg7 {I first considered Nh6+, but didn’t see it giving enough and eventually found and preferred Nxg7.  Even though it is less forcing, it causes more damage.  Obviously, the bishop can't take the knight because after Qg4 it is mate next move.} Bc8 20. Nf5 {1-0.  Black resigns, as there really is nowhere to hide.  A bad mistake on my part would have been the obvious 20. Nxe8 or 20. Bxd8.  Instead, the attack on the exposed king had to be continued, and bringing the knight back to f5 was the way to do it.  Now, if the black bishop doesn’t take the white knight on f5, it’s mate soon after 21. Qg4+.  And, if 20….BxNf5, then after 21. QxBf5, followed by 22. Be4, it’s either mate on h7 or black has to give up his queen (after 20…Qc4 and 21…Qxe4).  }
