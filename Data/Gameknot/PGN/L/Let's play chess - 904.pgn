1. e4 {This is the first game that I want to annonate about so you may excuse me if it's not made that good. 1. e4 is the most unpleasant move of the white. I don't like it at all. LOL!} e5 {Continuing the King's Pawn game I usually go for Four-Knights game as black so I usually answer by 1. ... e5 and followed by taking out the knights.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. a3 {Hmmm ... Okay ... Preventing my Dark Bishop from a quick development.} Nf6 {I'm just continuing my way ...} 4. Bb5 Bc5 {Looking for some space for my Queen's Pawn ...} 5. Bxc6 {Oh that?! Is he going to ... hmmm ... what?} dxc6 6. h3 {Oh my opnnets looks like that he hates Bishops' quick developments.} Nxe4 {I just wanted to make a start.} 7. Qe2 {Was it really necessary?} Nxf2 {Okay let's take that poor Pawn.} 8. Qxe5+ {Oh! He's checkin' me!} Qe7 {In a hope to make the game simple quickly.} 9. Qxe7+ {Yes... I was looking for this! :-D} Kxe7 {And now the black's king wakes up. I'm not upset about losing my castle. This way I can bring the King to game faster when it[s necessary.} 10. Rf1 {He's trying to push away my Knight and gain F's file control. Attacking my weak King's side.} Ne4 {The only response ...} 11. Ne5 {Oh that brave white Knight!} f6 {White's Knight had come too much close. I've got no better idea. This way I also could defend F's pawn.} 12. d3 {Attacking my Knight and opening the line for his dark Bishop.} Ng3 {I didn't  like to lose my position . g3 square looked safe to me. The other reason was that I hoped WCates to bring out his rook. I thought maybe I could use this tactic to attack his only active Rook.} 13. Rf3 {He did it.} Bd6 {Continuing my idea ...} 14. Rxg3 Bxe5 {Gettin' rid of that Knight and attacking the Rook but ... :-(} 15. Rxg7+ {Oh I didn't see that ... He blew up my Pawns' line.} Kd6 {The King didn't want to go back to his bedroom!} 16. Nc3 {And now white's trying to attack my centre-postioned King.} Bf5 {Preventing Ne4 and the only reasonable move to bring out my Bishop.} 17. Be3 {I belive white did it in order to delay my A's Rook development.} Bg6 {Blocking White's Rook's way ( ... f5)} 18. d4 {The best defence.} Bg3+ 19. Bf2 {My dark Bishop might had ben looked a bit dangerous to WCates.} Rae8+ 20. Ne2 Bxf2+ 21. Kxf2 Bxc2 {More space for my pawns!} 22. Nf4 Rhg8 {I had to get rid of that disturbing Rook somwhow.} 23. Rxh7 {Oh! He just didn't see my light Bishop.} Bxh7 24. Rd1 Be4 {Nothing. Just threatening G's pawn ... But I think it wasn't the right move.} 25. b4 Rgh8 {Planing for the fourth line.} 26. Rd2 Rh4 27. Kg3 Reh8 28. Re2 Bb1 {Why did I do that?!} 29. Re6+ {Oh yes! My last silly move resulted this.} Kd7 30. Rxf6 Rh8h7 {No more checks!} 31. Ne6 Ke8 {Why did I do that?!} 32. Ng5 Rxd4 33. Nxh7 {Now things looks safer. Well maybe that was a silly thing to do ... :-(} Bxh7 34. Re6+ Kd7 35. Rh6 Be4 36. Rh4 Kd6 37. Rh6+ Ke5 38. Rh8 Rd2 {The best chance to push the White's King aside.} 39. Rc8 {What else could he do?!} Rxg2+ 40. Kh4 {Now I had a hope tp perform my favourite (King-Rook-King) checkmate on White.} Bf5 41. Rxc7 {Nothing else to do ... Or maybe h8, huh?!} Kf4 42. Rxb7 Rg8 43. Kh5 Rh8+ {44. Rh7 Rxh7   }
