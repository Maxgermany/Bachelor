1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bd6 {Game begins fairly routinely by both players until my second move which deviated from the world database but not GameKnot.  } 3. Bc4 {Move 3, I counter what I perceive to be a threat to my f7 pawn with my Queen. White castles very quickly.} Qe7 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 h6 {I launch my own attack on whites e4 pawn which is quickly countered by d3. I fear the file now opened for White's black bishop, and advance h6.} 6. a3 {White likes my idea and does the same cross board at a3.} a6 {I figure I might as well defend against whites white bishop too, a6} 7. b4 b5 {I block White's advancing pawn with mine, threatening white bishop.} 8. Bb3 c5 {Seeing an opening I move to c5, prompting a trade.} 9. bxc5 Bxc5 {I end up with my black bishop at c5.  Didn't understand why white moved rook to e1, maybe was unrelated to my move?} 10. Re1 Ng4 {But, I see another opening and advance my knight.} 11. d4 {White must have felt he had d4 adequately covered} exd4 12. Nxd4 {Again another pawn trade.} Qh4 {And again another opening spied with my Queen to h4} 13. Nf3 {White's knight returns to defend} Qxf2+ {but he cannot defend the options open to the Black Queen... who attacks and checks white King... apparently on a suicide mission!  } 14. Kh1 {For it appears that bishop to f2 or knight to f2 would have been the safer and more prudent move for Black.  But this Queen is out for blood!} Qg1+ {At all costs, Black Queen throws caution to the wind and attacks again only  to be taken by White's rook at g1} 15. Rxg1 Nf2# {But then the Black Knight takes vengeance on his Queen's death at the hands of white and exacts his revenge by a surprising strike forking White's King and Queen and checkmating white.  White's king had no where to go. Black, though severely behind in points at -8, nevertheless pulls off a rather quick and unexpected defeat of white.}
