1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Nf3 d6 5. e4 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. Nd2 Ne8 10. b4 f5 11. a4 f4 12. c5 Nf6 13. Ba3 g5 14. b5 {black finaly receives the message from earth that something went wrong with his game.the threath b6 is too strong to be ignored. offering an exchange doesn't seem to be too much of a price given the situation.} dxc5 15. Bxc5 Ng6 16. Bxf8 Bxf8 17. Nc4 {white knew he was winning. but this is a bit too optimistic.} Bc5 {black takes the chance and activates his bishop. with it on d4, things will not look that bleak . } 18. Kh1 {white is on the wrong track. f2-f3 is a bad idea when one doesn't have the means to chase away the black overseer from the a7-g1 diagonal.} Bd4 19. Rc1 g4 {taking a pawn with Bxc3 and Nf3 is shallow. white can exchange the bishops with Bg4, with better position. the only chance for black is to encourage his opponent in going forward with his bad idea of playing f2-f3. honestly, it looks bad for white, so there was some calculation involved. g3 seems like a good idea. Bd3 is also a plan. all in all, black has just a few threats, possibly not enough to equalise and he needs some sort of cooperation to make it happen. white, on the other hand, has played superficial the last couple of moves, and is still unaware of the fact that he has to be precise in defence for a while before claiming the win.} 20. f3 {is it so hard to see that a check would now also mean mate for the white king?} Nh5 {it's simple: put the knight on g3, then search a mate with the queen on the h file with a subsequent Qg5, since there is nothing to interfere. } 21. Qe1 {ich verstehe nur bahnhof. white is still under the impression that he has to defend against Qh4. but, as I said, this was never on the table. The real threat is Ng3. } Ng3+ 22. hxg3 Qg5 {See?} 23. Rf2 Qh6+ 24. Kg1 fxg3 25. Nd1 {suicide. the other option was to sac the queen (and the game) with 25. Bd3. In fact, White knows what's what already.  } Qh2+ {with mate in one, white resigns. }
