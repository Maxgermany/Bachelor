1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 {Highly unusual play. The Queen will be forced out on the next move if material equality is to be maintained.} 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Nc3 {Making the Queen move again.} Qe6 5. Bb5+ c6 6. Ba4 {Inducing him to weaken his Q-side again. Since K-side castling is out of the question for the moment, any Q-side weaknesses will make themselves felt against the King.} b5 7. Bb3 {Making the Quuen move yet again.} Qf6 8. Ne4 {And again.} Qe7 9. d3 h6 {Trying to prevent the B from moving to KN5, with yet another attack on the Queen.} 10. Be3 Bf5 {His first developed piece other than the Queen.} 11. O-O Nf6 12. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {The first tactical skirmish goes nowhere.} 13. Bd2 e4 14. Bc3 {Shielding the QNP and making the wandering Q move again.} Qe7 15. dxe4 Bxe4 16. Re1 {Pinning... and if the Queen moves away it won't help as the Bishop will still be pinned to the King.} f5 17. Ne5 {Threatening N-N6, forking Q and R.} Qg5 18. f3 {The Bishop is in trouble. If it moves, I have N-N6 dis ch winning the KR.} Bc5+ 19. Kh1 b4 {An attempt to complicate. However, my threats are superior.} 20. Nf7 Qh5 21. Nxh8 {Pouncing on the material.} bxc3 {A bad mistake. My opponent overlooked...} 22. Bf7+ {this shot! The wandering Queen is felled.} Qxf7 23. Nxf7 Kxf7 24. fxe4 {The smoke has cleared, and my huge material advantage is decisive.} cxb2 25. Rb1 Bb4 26. Re2 Kf6 27. Rxb2 {Black gives in to the inevitable and resigns.}
