1. d4 d5 2. c4 {I don't feel really comfortable with the Queen's Gambit, I can't help feeling like I'm giving away the piece. But the stats say it's very good so I thought I should give it a try.} e6 {Black declines the gambit.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. a3 Bxc3+ {Aggressive.} 6. bxc3 Nf6 7. e3 O-O 8. Ne5 dxc4 9. Bxc4 {We trade off several pieces, no clear advantage.} Nxe5 10. dxe5 {Another early exchange opens up the board..} Qxd1+ {I really don't like it when people do this :(} 11. Kxd1 Ne4 {This doesn't look particularly good for me.} 12. Rf1 {Preventing ... Nxf2+} Nxc3+ {I still lose a pawn} 13. Kc2 Nd5 14. e4 Nb6 15. Bb3 Bd7 16. a4 c5 17. a5 {Chasing off his knight} Nc8 18. Rd1 Rd8 {I guess this was a bad move for Black, costing him the bishop(?)} 19. Bg5 Rf8 {Would f6 have been a better option?} 20. Rxd7 {Here I gain the advantage.} h6 21. Be7 {I continue the offensive} Nxe7 {While behind, black decides to take my bishop in exchange for his knight.} 22. Rxe7 Rfb8 {Don't know why black does this, it traps his other rook in the corner.} 23. a6 {At this point, I felt my advantage was solid enough to trade a pair of rooks...} bxa6 24. Rxa6 Rb6 25. Raxa7 Rxa7 26. Rxa7 {... even won a pawn in the process.} Rb4 {Black was going for my e pawns here...} 27. Kc3 {I let him...} Rxe4 28. Bc2 {Because it would allow me to block his king's escape with my bishop} Rxe5 {I guess he doesn't see it. F5 might have bought him some time for me to make a mistake?} 29. Ra8# {And checkmate.}
