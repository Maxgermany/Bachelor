Be3 Bg4 12. Nd2 {12. Nd2 = If 12. O-O Bxf3 13. Bxf3 -  Light square bishop not active on offensive. Benoni usually less tactical but more positional piece play.} Bxe2 13. Qxe2 {Light Bishop exchanged} Nd7 14. f4 {due to the fact that at move 3. Nf3, white attacking move is lagging. Thus to minimize the lag, castling need to postponed to the right time. If at move 3.

If both players play accurately, position presume to be drawish.} Qd3 28. Nd1 Nxe4 29. Nxe4 Rxe4 {29. ... Re4?? :O a blunder that cost the game! Psychologically my opponent was too confident when rejecting the draw offer. Starting from that moment, I properly analyst the position. To see this is very pleasing! } 30. Nf2 {30. Nf2!!} Qxe3 31. Qxe4+ Qxe4 32. Nxe4 Be5 33. Rf7+ {33. Rf7 ! d6 pawn already gone.} Kg6 34. Rd7 Nf4 {last resort. } 35. Nxd6 Bd4+ {actually again last resort.} 36. Kh1 {Out of check. d5 pawn is save through zugzwang :)} Kf6 37. Ne8+ {Next 20 moves shown my opponent determination. To look back on the game, I still can't figure out where I'm doing wrong.
