[Opening "King's Indian, 3.Nf3 (E60)"]

1. d4 {(analysis not checked by computer)} Nf6 2. c4 g6 {The King's Indian Defence. Black allows White to build a pawn centre with the intention of a delayed attack. White must show his hand and create weaknesses in order to take advantage of Black's quiet play.} 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Nc3 d5 {It is more usual, and perhaps more in spirit with the King's Indian(?), to castle first.} 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Nxd5 {?! After 6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3, White would have had the perfect pawn centre.} Qxd5 7. e3 O-O 8. b3 {leaving the World (but not Gameknot) database. Black now chooses to apply pressure to White's pawn centre. This dominates the game for the next 9 moves.} c5 9. Bb2 Nc6 {leaving the Gameknot database. 9... cxd5 was previously played. I preferred to develop a piece, keep up the pressure, and prepare Rd8 where a double-pin on d1 and b2 becomes possible.} 10. Bc4 Qh5 {I instinctively disliked this move, putting the queen on the rim in a somewhat confined position. However, it's worth it for the attack on f3 and the pin on the h-pawn. } 11. O-O {?! I believe this loses a pawn. White would be better off breaking the pin by either defending or moving the bishop. Black would still have the initiative, however.} Rd8 12. a4 {This prevents a possible plan plan for Black based around a6 and b5, but the pawn is still there for the taking.} Bg4 13. h3 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Qxf3 15. gxf3 {The damage to White's pawn structure, added to the coming material loss, should be decisive.} cxd4 16. exd4 Nxd4 {White cannot avoid giving up the bishop pair here without further material loss. For example 17. Kg2 Nxf3 18. Bxg7 Nh4+ 19. Kg3 Nf5+. However, the opposite square bishops give White some hope. } 17. Bxd4 Rxd4 18. Rfe1 {?! Thanks to the revealed threat on a1, Black can now exchange the opposite square bishops, damage White's queenside pawn structure, and gain time.} Rxc4 19. bxc4 Bxa1 20. Rxa1 Rc8 21. Rc1 {White might be better off counter-attacking with a move like Rd1. One advantage of this strategy is that rook endgames are usually drawn if there are pawns on only one side of the board.} f5 {? A positional blunder, creating a backward pawn. White must play f4 in the next couple of moves to exploit this, but instead attempts to develop the king.} 22. Kg2 Kf7 23. Kg3 e5 {White's king is now a long way from the action.} 24. c5 b6 25. Rd1 bxc5 26. Rd7+ Ke6 27. Rxh7 c4 28. Rb7 c3 29. Rb1 c2 30. Rc1 Kd5 31. Kg2 Kd4 32. Kf1 Kd3 33. Ke1 a5 34. h4 Rc7 {White is in zugzwang, and is again several times in the remainder of the game. However, 34... f4 would have been more clinical.} 35. Rd1+ cxd1=Q+ 36. Kxd1 Rc2 {Yet again, f4 would have been more clinical.} 37. f4 e4 38. f3 e3 39. h5 gxh5 40. Ke1 Rc1# {}
