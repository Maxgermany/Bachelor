1. e4 {Another game that I think I played well other than a few mistakes, but I have only been playing for 7 months at this time so mistakes are going to happen. Fell free to comment if you see something I did not. I will try to learn all the abbreviations for pieces and moves in the future but I will do my best for now. } e5 2. Nc3 a6 3. Nf3 Bd6 4. Bc4 {This is how I was opening up most of the time for awhile. I grew not  so fond of it because if I move my Q pawn to d3 I end up leaving my bishop open for a pawn attack. } h6 5. d4 {Try to a achieve what I think is the Sicilian defence with a pawn exchange. } Nc6 6. a3 Qf6 7. Be3 Nge7 {We are both loaded up for a big exchange. } 8. d5 {Trying to force something to happen. I feel I have control of the center and want to see his reaction to my push. } Na7 {Don't think that was the best move, but then again I have only been playing for 8 or 9 months. His knight is useless for the time being. } 9. Ne2 Ng6 10. Ng3 {Preparing for a King side attack. } Be7 11. Nf5 d6 12. Nxe7 {Maybe I should not have sacrificed, but I definitely feel more comfortable attacking.} Qxe7 13. Qe2 Bd7 14. a4 {Defending his bishop from advancing to b5. Maybe not a very good move.  } Qf6 15. h3 O-O 16. g4 {After he castles I start to push my pawn attack. I should be able to castle in the next few moves and bring my other rook into the game.} Nf4 17. Bxf4 {I did not like that knight coming down on me. I struggle sometimes with defending the knight attacks. Maybe I have not been playing long enough to fully understand the best ways to defend them. } Qxf4 18. Nd2 Nc8 19. O-O-O Ne7 20. Kb1 Ng6 21. f3 Qf6 22. h4 Nf4 23. Qf2 {I have made him a nice little home for his knight. I am not feeling very comfortable at this point. Even though his knight does not seem to pose a great threat right now.} Ng6 24. Rdg1 Qf4 25. h5 {Now that my rook's are where I want them I will continue my push with the pawns.} Ne7 26. Rh4 {Now I feel a little more comfortable attacking his queen.} Qg5 27. f4 Qxf4 {My atatck is not looking so strong anymore, but I still feel I have the upperhand. } 28. Qxf4 exf4 29. Rf1 b5 30. axb5 axb5 31. Bb3 Ra7 32. Rxf4 c6 33. dxc6 Bxc6 34. g5 Bd7 35. gxh6 gxh6 {Now I have him opened up. } 36. Rf6 Ra6 37. e5 {I will need this pawn to back up my rook. I know he will be moving his King to g7. } Kg7 {There it is. } 38. Rh2 Be6 {This was a big mistake. Now I get  a bishop for free. } 39. Bxe6 fxe6 {Not what I thought he would do. Instead of giving me a bishop for free he gave me his rook in 2 moves.} 40. Rg2+ Kh7 41. Rxf8 Nf5 42. Rg6 dxe5 43. Rgf6 {His next move was the ending. I guess he overlooked what was coming. } Nd4 {Big mistake. } 44. Rf6f7# {}
