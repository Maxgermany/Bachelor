[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 {Just like his game with jegrace1, Joe started things off with the English Opening.} Nf6 {This was also jegrace's response.} 2. d4 {Likewise, Joe answers with the same move.} e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {This is where things change because in the last game jegrace1 played 3...d5, and this was played a move after.  But, albertwall, pinned at this point.  Between the timing of when they occurred, I would've done the same as albertwall, as it looks more aggressive.  As this pin, temporarly blocks in the Nc3 which appears, somewhat dangerous.} 4. e3 {This was played to open up a line for Joe's Bf1.} O-O {Regardless, albert decides to castle, at once.  This is also what I would've done.} 5. Nge2 {At first, I did not know why Joe played this.  It does develop, but as white, I would've played 5.Nf3.  The reason being is that this appears to block his Bf1.  I believed, however, that Joe's plan was to bring that N to f4 which looks stronger then on f3 since it's also about where you place your pieces, as I've learned from Ken and GM Susan Polgar.} d5 {Meanwhile, albertwall breaks right through the center by advancing his d pawn.} 6. a3 {Instead of breaking the pin with 6.Bd2, which I have been known to do, Joe picks this.  I think it's the right choice because commentators, including, kenneth_fiore_3 told me not to just break the pin with a B because Jack Stockel said that it is generally the best option.  The problem is that I did not give that anymore thought until an annotation.  And, nuntar mentioned that in many cases there's a better way to break the pin then just using the B because it is more aggressive.  What Mike was alluding to is attacking with the pawn as TA did.  And, that is also why played 5.Nge2, as opposed to, 5.Nf3.  The idea being is that, instead of the N, had Bd2 been played, albertwall would not have had a problem because Joe's Nc3 is more powerful, in this position.  With that being said, if black were to exchange now, white would just bring the other N to the more powerful.  Not surprisingly, black will have none of that, so he is now forced to lose tempo.  Afterwhich, Joe will get a favorable exchange of pawns because albertwall will wind up with isolated pawns. } Be7 7. cxd5 exd5 8. g3 {What's more is that Joe was also able to use that tempo to fianchetto.  As now, he'll have a very good place to develop his B.} Nbd7 {Meanwhile, Albert developed.  Now it might look like 8...Nc3?! was more favorable.  However, he played advanced the d pawn, and is, therefore, following the general guideline for 1.d4 openings.  You're better off not bringing the N to the c square until the c pawn advanced.  Until this game, I thought that it only applied for 1.d4 openings, or if white plays d4, and black answers ...d5 before advancing the d pawn.  But, after this move, I learned that it even applies after 1.e4, that is when, d4 and ...d5 are played before that N has come into play.} 9. Bg2 {In the meantime, Joe continues with his development by completing the fianchetto.  And, he'll be ready to castle, after albertwall's next move.} Nb6 10. O-O Re8 {And, albertwall goes for it by centralizing his R which is also a good way to develop your game, as I have learned from elyhim.} 11. Qc2 {Joe played this with the idea of completing his development and, thereby, connecting his Rooks.} c6 {I don't know why albertwall played this, as his c7 pawn wasn't in danger.  I would've been inclined to complete my development by moving the Bc8, in this position.} 12. b3 {This is very unusual, and kenneth_fiore_3 told me that it's generally not a good idea to do it since that's what the modern systems show.  But, it works here since Joe played it.  And, it's a doubled fianchetto, which happens when you fianchetto both Bishops.} Bd6 {I don't know why albert played this.  I'd still get the Bc8 into play, but I believe the idea is to allow an eventual ...Qe7 since that's where the B was.} 13. f3 {Joe is starting to create a pawn storm.  Even without a solid pawn chain, the d-h pawns are connected.  What I know is that you want to keep your pawns connected because they work well together.  In fact, that's also the idea behind a pawn chain, as they're also connected that way and help one get a passed pawn that could, and sometimes will, promote.} Be6 {Meanwhile, albertwall completes his development, at once.} 14. Nf4 {Meanwhile, Joe prepares to exchange, and I know why.  As GM Susan Polgar mentioned in one of her lectures, B's are usually favorable over the N's.  That's why even though Susan said don't exchange without a valid reason, as noted, she was, specifically, alluding to, B for N.} Rc8 {I'm not sure why albertwall played, but I would've played 14...Bd7 or 14...Bc8 because Joe will now exchange, and this appears to favor him for the reason mentioned above.} 15. Nxe6 fxe6 16. Bb2 {This is a reason why.  With the completed doubled fianchettoed, the B's are going to be monsters.  At the moment, white's Bg2 only covers 2 squares, and the Bb2 only covers 1.  But, with a pawn move or the N moving, that would all change.  If and when that happens, things will become dangerous for black.} c5 {albertwall tries to stop white from doing anything with his pawns. } 17. Bh3 {But, Joe has other ideas as he puts pressure on the e6 pawn.} a6 {I believe that albertwall is trying to get a solid pawn chain with this move since the a pawn is now symmetrical to the b pawn.} 18. Rfe1 {Meanwhile, Joe centralizes one of his R's in the same way that albertwall centralized his R.} Nbd7 {I don't see the point behind this move because it appears to limit the mobility of black's Queen.  On the other hand, I would not know what to do, in this position, as black.} 19. Rac1 {But, this is what I also would've played as white since Joe's R is directly behind his Q.} b5 {My instinct for albertwall's 17th move was correct.  As I saw this move coming down the road.  And, it is what I was alluding as this is where having a pawn chain becomes powerful, as I have studied with TA in his former forum called, "The Deeper Theory Chess Club."} 20. Kg2 {I'm not sure why Joe activated his K since this is not the endgame, yet.  Combine this with another game, and I also learned that, sometimes, the K can become a powerful weapon, as early as, the middle of the mid game.} Qb6 {Trying to win a pawn.  The idea being is that, if black were to take, and white recaptures, black now has the Q which means that he'd win a pawn.} 21. Qe2 {Joe protects that pawn by adding another defender.} Kh8 {I'm not sure why albertwall played this.  As black, I would've been inclined to play 21...Kf8 where the K is closer to the center.  As centralizing the K is important.  With that being said, I believe that there is a mate threat that I'm not seeing.  As then, you want to put the monarch into the corner, as I have learned from Jack Stockel with the pinning motif.} 22. Qd1 {I'm not sure why Joe played this.  As white, I'd want to exchange on e4 here, as now, white's Re1 looks very dangerous.  On the other hand, I know why Joe would not exchange here because it then becomes the question of what you do you get from exchanging, as kenneth_fiore_3 asked in a previous annotation.} Qb8 {I am not sure why albertwall retreated his Q since it doesn't appear to be in danger.  In fact, even if it were there, and Joe makes the same move that he's about to play being 23.dxc5, black would recapture the same way that he does with 23...Bxc5, and Q is still safe.} 23. dxc5 Bxc5 24. Na2 {Likewise, I don't Joe moved the N here.  It didn't appear en-prise.  For example, 24...b4, would've, obviously, been met with 25.axb4, and the N is still protected.} Bd6 {Likewise, I don't know why albertwall played this.  Perhaps, he was worried about 25.Qc2, but the B would still be protected by the N.  In fact, I find this move to be inferior since Joe will exchange R's.  And, I believe that this exchange will be favorable for white.} 25. Rxc8 Qxc8 26. Nb4 {Similarly, I don't know why Joe the N here.  The a6 pawn is protected by the Q.  My guess is that he was hoping that black would exchange with 26...Bxb4?! since it's N for B.} Qb7 {But, albertwall, doesn't waist anytime and brings his Q into action.} 27. Qd2 {As does Joe.} a5 {And, albertwall goes for Joe's N.} 28. Nd3 a4 {Hoping to get a passed pawn, albertwall advances.  Not surprisingly, Joe stops that by exchanging it.  With that, I felt that the position was level before.  But, I now favor white's position, slightly.} 29. bxa4 bxa4 30. Qc2 {In it's aftermath, Joe goes for a Q side assault against the K.} Qa8 {Of course, albertwall tries to stop it since the plan appears to be 31...Qb8.} 31. Nf4 {But, it might be too little too late.  It's not official.  And, as black, I would think that there's something that could be done about it.} Nf8 {As much as I don't want to exchange N for B, I'd find it necessary, and therefore, would've responded with 31...Bxf4 to prevent 32.Ng6+, followed by 33.Qxg6 where mate is then threatened.  But, albertwall found a move that I would not have seen, and I like it even better.  As this also stops the threat without needing the unfavorable exchange.} 32. Rc1 {Meanwhile, Joe goes back to square 1, by bringing the behind the Q, again.} Qa5 {Trying to bring the Q in action by keeping it in play.  I think that albertwall is trying to bring in another defender since Joe's Q and N are very powerful, despite 31...Nf8 being played.} 33. Nd3 {In fact, Joe is showing that by moving the N back again.  As this blends in with N visualization counts since it shows when and why TA moves the N back and forth, like this.} Qb5 {I believe that albertwall is still trying to prevent Joe launching an attack against black by putting a little pressure on the N.} 34. Ne5 {But, Joe will have none of that.  As white is now threatening to win a piece with a N fork.} Kg8 {But, albertwall stops that.} 35. Bd4 {So, Joe resorts to plan B.  With that being said, I wasn't sure why he played this, until albertwall's next move.  But, white intends to play 36.Ba7  I'm not sure what it does, but I know that it's dangerous, since albertwall is about to stop this with 35...Re7} Re7 36. Qd1 {So, Joe goes to the next phase with this move.  His plan is to pin albertwall's Nf8 with 37.Rc8.} Rc7 {Like before, albertwall stops it with his other R.  But, Joe is ready because he exchanges on the next move.  The reason being is that black's R is also powerful, so white wants to take that power away from albertwall.} 37. Rxc7 Bxc7 38. Kf2 {And, this is where Joe centralizes his K by bringing it closer to the center.} Qe8 {I'm not sure why albertwall played this, but I don't think there was a better move for him.  In fact, like before, I would not know what to do as black, in my opinion.  And, with me favoring white's position, I don't think that black has any more good moves left.  In other words, no move is better or worse, in my opinion.} 39. Qa1 {As now, Joe goes on the offense, big time by aligning his Q with DSB.  By align, I mean that Joe puts his Q on the same diagonal as his Bd4.} Qh5 {Doing whatever he can for counterplay, albertwall attacks Joe's B.  I'd retreat here, but I like Joe's next move better.} 40. Kg2 {As Joe protects with his monarch which is another example of how powerful the K becomes during the endgame.} Ng6 {Still trying to do what he can, albertwall tries to win a piece by bringing in another attacker.  But, it is too little too late, as Joe is going to win a pawn since black will be in check.} 41. Bxe6+ {And, with that albertwall, resigned.  The reason being is that Joe now has a pawn without a compensation with a series of checks.  There is no immediate mate, but I believe that there is nothing that black to do to stop TA from getting a passed pawn.  That would be enough of a reason for me to resign.  That's because, in this case, a passed pawn would almost guarantee Joe a promotion.  And, I think that the only way for black to stop that would be to deal with the loss of an additional piece without compensation, like one of this N's.  With that, I'm pretty sure that albertwall felt like he had nothing left.  In the aftermath of this Joe told me something that kenneth_fiore_3 during our first training game.  During that lesson, I was learning to control myself when it came to exchanges and look at multiple.  As Ken refused to exchange because of the amount of pressure he had which is, eventually the way I started thinking after remaining impulsive.  In it, Ken said, "This type of position is white trading pieces down is the wrong idea sometimes. If you've got pressure on an opponent, trading eases things for the opponent."  And, that amount of pressure is how he won, after a blunder from me.  He also said, "What's important from this game is that you are learning to think about your future moves in regards to multiple threats"...  For me, that's instructive and educational because the similarity is the amount of pressure that Joe had against albertwall.  With that being said, the moral of this story is what Joe said which reads, "Albert I defeated several times,but under different handle names.His  weakness is multiple attacks with added pressure in the mid to endgame."  }
