[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {I chose the Scandinavian defence to be my defence. I wanted to suprise him with an opening he must never have played against before. Also, I have been studying Michael Melts' book: "Scandinavian Defence: the dynamic 3...Qd6" and I wanted to check out the knowledge and ideas I have gained.} 2. e5 {Avoiding mainline Scandinavian. I tried to play the position as a French Defence: advance variation.} c5 {Sticking to the plan.} 3. d3 {A rather poor move. The pawn has less scope on the centre. Rather better was d4.} Nc6 {Attacking the e5 pawn.} 4. f4 {Supporting it with the f-pawn since he hasn't yet developed his king's knight to f3. } f6 {Undermining White's center as it is in every French defence stategy to undermine White's center. Position was only seen 4 times before in Gameknot database.} 5. exf6 {Poor move. It handles Black the centre and space advantage. } Nxf6 {The knight comes out with development.} 6. Nc3 {I don't know the idea behind this move.} e5 {Not afraid to open some lines since you have the better view of the position.} 7. fxe5 Nxe5 8. Bf4 Bd6 {As said before, black get's the center with the d5 and c5 pawn and gets a space advantage too.} 9. Qe2 {Getting ready to castle queenside.} O-O {10.Bxe5 is refuted by 10...Bxe5 where Black gets the two bishops in an open game. 11.Qxe5 will be wrong because 11...Re8 would skewer the White queen to the White king. Black will then be material up. } 10. O-O-O {As mentioned before, but this move is actually a mistake because White looses the exchange by Black's next move. 10.Bxe5 and 11.Qxe5 is surely to be recommended instead of this move.} Bg4 {10...Nxd3+ is also strong gaining a pawn because of the dark square bishop which is undefended at f4. But, it will be my second favourite move in this position.} 11. Qe1 {11.Nf3 will be a mistake because of 11...Nxf3 12.Bxd6 Nd4 13.Qe7 Nf5 14.Qxd8 Rfxd8 16.Bc7 Rd7 where two pieces are under attack. In the least best continuation White looses a bishop and Black will be a piece up. } Bxd1 12. Nxd1 {12.Bxe5 will be wrong because of 12...Re8 or 12..Qe8!. I was counting of the first move 12...Re8 13.Bxf6 Rxe1 14.Bxd8 Rxd8 15.Nxd1 Rxf1. Black will be the exchange up and White pieces will be in a poor position. The rest will be a technique to me.} Nxd3+ {Gaining a pawn because of the undefended dark square bishop.} 13. cxd3 Bxf4+ 14. Kb1 Re8 15. Qf2 Be5 16. Nf3 {I didn't mind giving up a pawn because of the following variation. 16.Qxc5 Rc8 17.Qf2 (17.Qxa7 Qc7) Qc7: very similar to the game. White is having mate issues to deal with while he is still undeveloped.} Qa5 {Getting the queen in an aggressive position which threatens the White king. Also, it defends the c5-pawn just in case.} 17. g3 {Instead developing will be much better.} c4 {Sacrificing a pawn to open up lines to the White king.} 18. dxc4 {White accepts it when he is still undeveloped. Also, it weakens the e4 square which the knight can occupy.} Rac8 {Developing the rook which was still undeveloped to the open c-file.} 19. cxd5 {A blunder that allows Black's next move.} Qc7 {! White's d-pawn could be captured at any time. Black threatens mate on the c1 square or threatens to get a dangerous check at c1 and win the d1 knight. } 20. Qc2 {?? A blunder. But every continuation is favoring Black. 20.Qd2 Ne4! 21.Qe3 Qc2+ 22.Ka1 Qxd1 23.Qc1 Qxc1++. Also, 20.Nc3 is met by 20...Ne4 21.Qc2 Nxc3+ 22.bxc3 Qb6+ 23.Qb3 Qg6+! 24.Qc2 Qxc2+ 25.Kxc2 Rxc3+ with the next move for Black being 26.Rxf3 ( A pretty long variation): Black even gains another piece and White's position is lost.} Qxc2+ {Black is a queen up and mates next move. 0-1 Black resigns. Thanks my opponent for the game.}
