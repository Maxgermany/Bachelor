[Opening "Centre game (C22), Paulsen attack"]

1. e4 e5 {The king's pawn! I like  the king's pawn! Ruy Lopez, shall we?} 2. d4 exd4 {Aww dang...I'm not fond  of this opening. Brutes sending their special lady's out to avenge pawns, and what  not...what's the world coming to? But the world is not fair and white gets to lead the dance.   ..............................................................................................  Blake84120 Wrote: Nf3 is fairly common here, and the Danish Gambit (3. c3) is also playable, as is 3. Bc4. At this point, it's premature to assume white is sending his lady out to avenge pawns.  ..............................................................................................  It's not too early to assume anything, because I wrote this note long after the game was over. But...correct me if I'm wrong this so called Nf3, Bc4, c3 "danish gambit" none of those moves will recover that  lost  pawn, right? Now that he's come this far he gotta bring the queen out here, so far as I can see.} 3. Qxd4 Nc6 {And now I will chase your special lady around a bit. Now you are all on the defensive. You NEVER shoulda came outside this early! Get back in your house!  ..............................................................................................  Blake84120: Even though you can chase his special lady, all you can really gain her is a little tempo.   ..............................................................................................  Actually if you flip forward a little you will see how wrong you are about this.} 4. Qe3 b6 {(She didn't retreat far enough, you'll see.)  ..............................................................................................  blake 84129 (again, sigh): Actually, she did. She's quite safe here. This opening by white is known as the Paulsen Attack (although I'm not quite sure what Paulsen would be attacking from here). While it doesn't seem to exemplify white's best options in the opening, it's far from a foregone conclusion.  ..............................................................................................  It IS a foregone conclusion that patzers shouldn't pull their queens out early. Look on and you will see what  Paulson is attacking/what I am attacking. If this guy was a chessmaster, than maybe he could pull his queen out early, but he ain't one, and he can't. I am trying to help people here. (Keep in mind I wrote all these comments knowing how the game went. It's not like I am talking trash here.)} 5. f4 Bc5 {More queen chasing, you bring the queen out early, and all you can do is make her run all over the place like a chicken with it's head cut off until you block her in again, or she gets herself killed.  } 6. Qc3 Bb4 {Worst possible move. Now the game is basically over. I got her nailed to the king, and there will be no more queen come next turn.  ..............................................................................................  blake84120: White obviously wanted to attack the pawn at g7, a target typical of the Paulsen variation, though for obvious reasons the attack is usually carried out from g3.  .............................................................................................. Good observation, I didn't see that, and had no idea what  white was thinking. Agreed, g3 would have  been much better.  Might even have gotten me...though I doubt it.} 7. Qxb4 Nxb4 {See?} 8. Na3 Bb7 {I am threatening yer pawn now, better guard him. But he is too depressed over his dead lady, and he puts another nail in his coffin.} 9. Be3 Bxe4 {See? I got him.} 10. O-O-O Qe7 11. Nf3 O-O-O 12. Bc4 d5 {Pawn chasing off bishop, to free up my queen (so she dun have to guard f7 from him) for this next gambit. Watch this!} 13. Bb5 Bxf3 {So I took his knight. He can take me back with the pawn, but he might as well not do it, since when I moved my bishop  I opened up a line to attack HIS bishop. All he can do is even trade me, which isn't  to his advantage being ladyless.} 14. gxf3 Qxe3+ {He takes it anyway probably to protect the rook's spot on h1. But he still loses that pawn, and now he's lost the bishop too.} 15. Kb1 Qxf3 {And this is where he resigns.  Good game, bro.  .............................................................................................. gmflash2008: This was completely senseless.  .............................................................................................. Really? It will probably make more sense  to  you when you learn some chess notation. :) GL!}
