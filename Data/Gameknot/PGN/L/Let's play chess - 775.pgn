1. d3 d5 2. f4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. Nf3 e6 6. c3 Bd6 7. O-O Nbd7 8. Qe1 O-O {I like my setup.  My opponent has given me a free hand in the center and I am prepared to attack on the Kingside.  However, my opponent does not give me anything easy.} 9. Nbd2 Qe7 10. Nd4 a6 {I thought here about c5 instead to gain space in the center.  However, it allows the N to jump to b5, forcing the trade of my dark square B.  I decided I wanted to keep the B.} 11. c4 {An excellent move.  I can't play dxc4 because my Bb2 hangs.} Rab8 12. b3 Bc5 {Playing dxc5 and then exchanging Bs might have been better.  I would have a better chance of a Kingside attack.  On the other hand, White would be stronger in the center.  The problem with Bc5 is that is allows White to take more time to develop.} 13. Bb2 Ng4 14. e3 Ngf6 15. h3 Bd6 16. Nd2f3 {White's position was always solid, but with time to develop, White may now be better.} dxc4 17. bxc4 Nc5 18. Rd1 Na4 19. Rb1 Nxb2 20. Rxb2 {Maybe I can now cause some problems on the Queenside for White.} Rfe8 21. e4 Bc5 {Avoiding the e5 pawn fork.} 22. Qc3 Rbd8 23. Kh2 Nd7 24. Ne2 Qf8 {I'm cramped and White is doing a good job exploiting the bind.} 25. Nd2 Be7 26. a4 {a4 is undefended and d3 is poorly defended (Q only).  I see an opportunity.} Nc5 27. Ra1 Nxd3 {Sneaking a pawn.  Plus I have a tempo because the N is hitting White's R.} 28. Rbb1 a5 29. Nd4 {A good move which cuts off my N and heads the N to an outpost at b5.} Nb4 30. Nb5 Rd3 {I need to make space for my R.  I also gain a tempo by hitting White's Q.  Playing c6 to dislodge the N immediately loses the exchange to Nc7.} 31. Qc1 Bc5 32. Rb3 {White avoids the temptation to play Nxc7.  Now that my R has space, his N would be poorly placed on c7.} Red8 33. Rxd3 Nxd3 {Gaining a tempo by hitting the Q again.  White's Queenside pawn structure is a problem and I will keep trying to beat on it.} 34. Qc2 c6 {Now I have time to dislodge the annoying N.} 35. Nc3 {White's center is still better, but I have a slight material edge and better pawn structure.  Overall, I think Black is equal.} Nb4 {Gaining another tempo by hitting the Q.} 36. e5 {In the heat of battle, White somehow missed the attack on the Q.  I think White probably had a good plan to open the e4 square to drop on the the Ns in.  This was a very unfortunate move in a well-played game for White.  I am guessing egill's rating will rise from where it is now!  } Nxc2 {White resigned.  The material deficit is just too much to overcome.}
