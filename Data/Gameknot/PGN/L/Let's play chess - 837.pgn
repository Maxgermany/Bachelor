1. e4 {at one point, i thought i'd probably lose this game. then i thought it was a draw. i went on to win, but only because of a couple of mistakes. i thought i'd put this up, see if anyone has suggestions for my opening moves, which were particularly bad.} e5 2. Nf3 f6 {i don't see this much, i'm used to Nc6 or Nf6 here. so, from here on out, i'm completely winging it. openings may be my biggest problem at the moment...} 3. d4 d6 {i was dismayed to see this -- from the rating, i thought my opponent was probably a weaker player than me, so i wanted to lead the game to open, tactical lines.} 4. Be3 {i have no clue if this move was a good idea or a terrible one for me, but i suspect there was a much better continuation somewhere in there. maybe h3 first?} Bg4 {this pin is really annoying. it's not like i didn't see it coming... i allowed it, thinking he'd be forced to take soon. lunacy!} 5. Bc4 {hoping to take advantage of that open diagonal by not letting black castle.} Nc6 6. Bb5 {moving the piece twice. probably a bad decision. i thought i was saving the pawn and/or preventing my g-pawn from doubling on the f-file, but i think there are other ways forward.} a6 {my last move is looking silly already.} 7. h3 {i think it's better for me if both bishops are off the board. if his pawns are locked on dark squares, his remaining bishop starts to look silly and his light squares should be weak, potentially available for my knights.} Bh5 8. Ba4 {we both try to keep the pins.} b5 {naturally, i'd seen this. i thought my bishop should settle on d5 or e6 to some annoying effect. still, around here, i was starting to feel like black had an advantage.} 9. Bb3 a5 {the bishop can't be trapped yet. seems like wishful thinking.} 10. Bd5 Nge7 11. g4 {weakens the kingside. i was basically hoping to trade off the light-squared bishops with this move.} Bg6 {an annoying move, but i take the chance to try to hem that dark-squared bishop in.} 12. Bxc6+ Nxc6 13. d5 {this was the idea. threaten the piece, make it awkward, lock the pawns a little before protecting my e4 pawn. still, i think black should be giving me a really hard time after moving the knight somewhere safe with the plan of pushing the c-pawn. i think with correct play, black should have an advantage here. his king looks potentially much safer than mine if the center opens.} Nb4 {i was surprised to see this move. i think it's a waste.} 14. c3 Na6 {only square. looks awkward there.} 15. Nbd2 {protecting that pawn finally, but cutting off a little of my queen's mobility.} b4 16. Nh4 {i decided i wasn't too worried about that c-pawn being taken just yet. still, this could have wound up awkward for me. i figured that after recapturing with the b-pawn, my center would be a little stronger. i'm not so sure my thinking was correct on this one, though.} Nc5 {the knight essentially must be captured here. i think this is weakening for my opponent. that dark-squared bishop continues to look silly.} 17. Bxc5 dxc5 18. Nxg6 {that bishop has given me enough trouble for one game.} hxg6 19. c4 {mostly trying to lock things up. i thought i was steering for a draw. even though my knight should be a little better than his bishop, i think this game would be very hard to win for white.} Qc8 {threatening to break through on the kingside soon.} 20. Qa4+ Qd7 {trying to keep that queen from being useful. if he moves the king, i should probably take.} 21. b3 {i figured the doubling of those pawns wouldn't be a real disadvantage if he took on a4. everything should be basically locked down.} f5 22. f3 f4 {this move seems to make his g-pawns totally useless. i can't really think of how he can break out on the kingside now. in his position, i would probably prefer to maintain the tension. i might even try to build up preparing for c6.} 23. Kf2 Be7 24. Kg2 {hoping to free my rook, at least temporarily. here i offered a draw. i still think with correct play, this should probably be drawn.} Bh4 25. Rad1 g5 {i think this was a mistake. that bishop now looks pretty useless. the most useful thing it can do is get out of the way of his rook's pressure on my h-pawn.} 26. Nb1 g6 27. Rd3 c6 {he was probably trying to free his queen up here, but this move starts to become awkward soon...} 28. Rhd1 Rc8 {looks like it protects the pawn, but i think by this point his position may be beyond salvaging. my control of the d-file should be decisive, especially considering that useless bishop of his.} 29. dxc6 {if the queen recaptures, he loses a rook, as we'll see. other moves? if Qc7, hoping to block the pawn, Rd7 will start to make life very unpleasant, and loss of heavy material and/or quick mate is inevitable. but where else can that queen go? i don't see an adequate defense from here.} Qxc6 30. Qxc6+ Rxc6 {removing the defender of the d8 square to recapture.} 31. Rd3d8+ {loses the rook.} Ke7 32. Rxh8 Rd6 {and now the final mistake, trading down. but i don't see how black can hold on much longer regardless.} 33. Rxd6 Kxd6 34. Ra8 {black resigns. funny he turned that draw down, eh! i think i really got lucky in this game, especially given my shaky, awkward opening and middle-game.}
