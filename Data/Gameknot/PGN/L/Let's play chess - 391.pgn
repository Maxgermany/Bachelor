1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 {I think this is the soundest continuation for white. The older 4. Qc2 prematurely activates the queen. 4. Bd2 is too defensive and places the bishop on a poor square. 4. a3 forces a retreat or exchange, but neglects development.} Bxc3+ {This is playable, but I like 4...c5 or 4...O-O. Not many people play 4...Bxc3 any more, but it was fashionable some 50-60 years ago. It seems to prematurely commit black to a plan that may not work out. The plus is that it doubles a pawn, but really that's not much of a weakness for white and may even be a strength, since he gets a big central pawn mass to control the center squares.} 5. bxc3 O-O {Mencik-Golombek, England, 1931, continued: 5...d6, 6. Bd3, c5, 7. e4, e5, 8. Ne2, Nc6, 9. O-O, Qe7, 10. f3, b6, 11. Be3, O-O. White has the advantage, but black's position is not bad. My old ECO gives 5...d6, 6. Bd3, Bb7, 7. f3 (7. Nf3, Ne4 threatens ...f5), d6, 8. Ne2, Nbd7 (8...Nc6, 9. e4, e5, 10. O-O, Qe7, 11. f4 favors white: Ivkov-Lombard, Bath, 1973), 9. O-O, Qe7, 10. e5, a5, 11. Rb1, e5, 12. Ng3, g6, 13. f4, good for white (Farago-Puschmann, Hungary, 1971).} 6. Bd3 c6 {I much prefer something like 6...c5. White wouldn't dream of tripling pawns. Anyway, black could recapture after 7. dxc5, Qa5.} 7. Nf3 {7. Ne2 or 7. f3 could be played.} b6 {Black will miss his chance to challenge the center. 7...d5 was called for.} 8. O-O Bb7 {8...Ba3 is an interesting try. But here, the bishop is practically useless. Now white makes his push:} 9. e4 d5 {Too late.} 10. e5 Ne8 {His best try was 10...Ne4. This loses material.} 11. Bxh7+ {A quieter idea was 11. Ba3, winning the exchange, but this looked like a sound sac.} Kxh7 12. Ng5+ Kg8 {Or 12...Kg6, 13. Qg4, f5 (13...Nf6, 14. exf6, Qxf6, 15. Ne4+, Kh7, 16. Nxf6+, gxf6, 17. Qh4+, Kg6, 18. Qh6+, Kf5, 19. Qh5+, Ke4, 20. Qf3#), 14. Qg3, f4, 15. Bxf4, Rxf4, 16. Nxe6+, Kh7, 17. Nxd8.} 13. Qh5 {Black could resign.} Qxg5 {The only possibility.} 14. Bxg5 f6 15. exf6 Nxf6 16. Bxf6 Rxf6 17. Rfe1 {Gameknot's computer analysis:  Mistake: +5.88 » 17. Rfe1 Na6 18. cxd5 cxd5 19. Re5 Raf8 20. f3 Nc7 21. Rae1 Rf5 22. Rxf5 Rxf5 23. Qg4 Rf7 24. Kf2 a6 25. f4 Best: +7.25 » 17. Qe8+ Rf8 18. Qxe6+ Rf7 19. cxd5 cxd5 20. Qe8+ Rf8 21. Qg6 Nd7 22. Rfe1 Rf6 23. Qd3 Rf7 24. Re6 Raf8 25. f3 Kh8 26. Rae1 a6 27. Re7. I did consider 17. Qe8+, Kh7!, and then what? 18. Rfe1, Na6, 19. Qa5+, Kg8, 20. Qg4, Re8, 21. cxd5, cxd5, 22. Re3, Nc7! Anyone see improvements here?} Nd7 18. cxd5 cxd5 {If 18...exd5, 19. Re7.} 19. Re3 {Black's weaknesses are his h-file and his e-file, especially e6. White eyeballs both.} Rh6 {So far, one rook defends both.} 20. Qe2 {The queen has amazing mobility and range, especially on the white squares. Watch as she swings right and left and penetrates the seventh and eighth ranks.} Re8 21. Re1 Nf8 22. Qb5 Re7 23. f4 {I toyed with the idea of 23. Rg3, but black seems able to defend, for now, the g7 square. The text move obviously threatens 24. f5.} Rf7 {Or 23...g6, 24. g4, Reh7, 25. R1e2, Bc8, 26. f5, gxf5, 27. gxf5, exf5, 28. Qxd5+, Be6, 29. Rxe6, Rxe6, 30. Rxe7, Nxe6, 31. Qxe6+.} 24. Qe8 {Once again threatening the e6-pawn by pinning a defender. The queen incidentally gets into a position where it can wreak havoc on the queenside.} Rff6 25. Qb8 {Winning more material.} Ba6 26. Qxa7 Bc4 27. g3 {Consolidating. White can't play 27. Qxb6, e5!} b5 28. Qa8 {Pinning the knight again. It's really potentially the most dangerous piece, so I want to keep it dormant!} Kh7 29. Re3e5 {Since all the files are at least half-closed, I have to create trouble on the e-file and the fifth rank, where I can move to the g-file.} Rh3 {Black is hallucinating. He won't have time to create a real threat.} 30. Rg5 {Aiming for g7.} Rfh6 {The problem with giving up the knight to attack the h2 pawn is that white's response immediately threatens mate, whereas black's taking of the h-pawn would not be a check and so would not require an immediate response. Gameknot's computer analysis: Blunder: +Mate(7) » … Rfh6 31. Qxf8 Rxg3+ 32. hxg3 Rg6 33. Rh5+ Rh6 34. Rxh6+ Kxh6 35. Qh8+ Kg6 36. Rxe6+ Kf5 37. Qh3#. Best: +7.38 » … Kg8 31. Qe8 g6 32. a3 Kg7 33. Ree5 Rf7 34. Rxe6 Nxe6 35. Qxe6 Rh6 36. f5 Rf6 37. Qe7+ Rf7 38. f6+ Kg8 39. Qe8+ Rf8 40. Rxg6+ Rxg6. } 31. Qxf8 Rg6 32. Rxe6 {This is the most colorful way to win. Of course, 32. Rxg6, Kxg6, 33. Rxe6+ might even be quicker, but I just liked this move! Black can't take it, of course. As I suspected, Gameknot's computer indicates that this move actually delays mate by a move. Though it does not give the moves, I suspect the best continuation is 32. Rxg3, Kxg3, 33. Rxe6+, Kh7, 34. Qf5+, g6, 35. Re7+, Kg8, 36. Qf7+, Kh8, 37. Re8# (or 37. Qg7#).} Rhh6 33. Re7 {Ha! Yes, we could have wiped out all the rooks, but this is quicker. Black's move is forced:} Rxg5 34. fxg5 Rg6 35. Qf5 Bxa2 36. Re6 {Black is officially in zugzwang. So, he resigned.}
