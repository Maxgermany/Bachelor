1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d5 {Let's be frank I planed on playing Benko as always, yet I was a bit drunk when I move and confused pawns} 3. Bg5 {I think whites best reply was cxd5. I would be bound to lose some tempo} c6 {As a caro-kann player I decided to go for a slav defence. After Bxf6 I would get to kinda ideas that I tend to exploit in Bronstein - Larsen variation of caro-kann or just accept doubled pawn for a pair of bishops} 4. e3 {solid move, consolidating pawn chain} Bf5 {Probably I should have moved my knight to e4 . Especially that white black square bishop seems to be a bad one due to placement of black pawns on white squares. } 5. Bxf6 exf6 {I decided it was good to make an e-file a semi open one due to lack of development of white king side } 6. a3 {stoping Bxb1 Rxb1 and Qa5+ winning a a2 pawn. By recapturing with Queen white blocks rook on a1} Bd6 {invitation to close the position and development of last piece on king side, I just couldn't find a better square for bishop for now} 7. Qa4 {pinning c6} O-O 8. cxd5 cxd5 {exchange alas, I end with IQP} 9. Nc3 {attacking IQP and developing} Bg6 {I have no idea why I moved like this, probably I got a good reason just can't recall it. Now it's seems like an inaccuracy and a useless move} 10. Nxd5 {materialistic play } Bxh2 {discovery attack allowing exchange of IQP for h2} 11. Bc4 {I have seen Qb5 with a threat to b7 pawn I was eager to sac this pawn to open lines against queen side and use lack of development of white pieces} Bc7 {probably taking Bxg1 was better, R1 on a semi open file aiming my king is a threat} 12. Ne2 Nc6 13. Nxc7 Qxc7 {connecting the rooks, and getting rid of well placed knight for my bad bishop} 14. Nf4 {f2 is pinned so this move is very good} Bf5 {escaping exchange} 15. Rh5 {probably preparing rooks to double up on h-file, good idea but seems like an inaccuracy } g6 16. Rh4 g5 {a fork} 17. Nd5 Qd6 {protecting f6} 18. Rh5 a6 {preparing and queen side attack and exploiting a fork threat on b5} 19. Qd1 {a bit passive probably some kind of ganging up on f7 seems to be a better idea} b5 {pushing pawns} 20. Bb3 a5 21. f4 {classic approach, when attacked on the wing counter in center, unfortunately it,s creating a massive weakness on e3 } a4 22. Ba2 {bishop find safety behind pawn chain on a very good diagonal} Be4 {forking a knight and a pawn} 23. fxg5 {good idea, due to weakness of e3 it's good to take away defense responsibility form it} Qg3+ 24. Kd2 Qxg2+ {pushing my luck, double attack on d5} 25. Kc3 {better was exchanging the queens} Rac8 {preparing a discovery check} 26. Nf4 {terrible blunder from now on a checkmate in 5 is inevitable} Ne5+ {I missed it, but still it's check mate in 7} 27. Kb4 Qxb2+ 28. Ka5 Qc3+ {opponent resigned, good game : )}
