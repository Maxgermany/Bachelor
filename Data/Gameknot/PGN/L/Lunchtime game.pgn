1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 {Horrible. 2... N-QB3 or 2... P-K3 make much more sense than using the Q.} 3. Bc4 {Looking to attack at once.} Qg6 {Why???} 4. O-O {Activating a Rook immediately.} Qxe4 {Pawn-grabbing, a chess sin.} 5. Bxf7+ {Obviously 5... KxB??? loses at once to 6 N-N5 ch!!! forking the royals.} Ke7 {Now the King becomes a target.} 6. Re1 {Seizing the half-open file with tempo.} Qf4 {Counterattacking the B...} 7. Rxe5+ {...which White willingly sacrifices.} Kxf7 {As good or bad as anything else.} 8. d4 {Looking to bring a new piece intro the attack, and gains another tempo.} Qf6 {Removing a flight square for the K.} 9. Ng5+ {Closing in.} Kg6 {Practically forced.} 10. Qd3+ {A fourth piece joins the hunt.} Kh5 {There is no shelter.} 11. g4+ {Tightening the noose.} Kxg4 {He goes down fighting to the end.} 12. Qh3# {Mercifully ending the torment.}
