[Opening "Sicilian (B23), Grand Prix attack, Schofman variation"]

1. e4 {Hello and welcome to part two of this ongoing team match! Now I have the White pieces, and I've abandoned my current infatuation with wing openings (English, Larsen, etc) in favor of the old standby, 1.e4! I was hoping to get some practice with the Sicilian, and my opponent very kindly gave it to me. The game that followed was about as wild as one might expect from this opening. Enjoy!} c5 {The Sicilian, also known as "That Intimidating Opening With Uncountable Thousands of Pages of Grandmaster Analysis Devoted To It". I'm going to go quickly through the first several moves, as there's no shortage of literature on it, by much better players than I.} 2. Nc3 {I usually play an open sicilian, so already I'm departing here from my more familiar lines.} Nc6 3. f4 {The Grand Prix! I should probably mention here that I actually don't know anything about this attack other than what I've gleaned from a few of l-d-j's OTB annotations.} g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 a6 {This is the first time the GK computer considers us to be "off-book", but there's still lots of precedent for this move.} 6. Bxc6 {White normally makes this exchange, as his LSB will be tough to use otherwise in the closed-in position.} dxc6 7. d3 Nf6 8. O-O {Both sides continue development. White's pawns are a little better, but of course the safety of his King might suffer a bit due to the advanced f-pawn.} Qc7 9. Qe1 {Both players re-position their Queens to be able to access the kingside more effectively. This is still all very standard: the big question for White is now which square--f2, g3, or h4--is best for his Queen. For Black, the question is just how to avoid creating any weaknesses for White to attack.} O-O 10. Be3 {This particular Bishop move was intended basically just to free White's Queen Rook, in preparation for swinging it to the center or all the way to f1. I chose to move to e3 rather than d2 simply because it's a "free" move: Black must respond to my threat on the c5 pawn.} b6 {So he does, but now the c6 pawn is weak.} 11. Ne5 {This is sort of an empty attack, since the c-pawn is defended, but the intention is really just to see what Black will do about this advanced Knight. Chess is as much a psychological game as anything else, and this Knight advance helps to reveal Black's mindset: is he willing to let the Knight stay? Will he just push back directly on the queenside?} Nd7 {Black wants the e5 Knight gone, and I don't blame him. White still gets something out of this, though: he's removed one of the Black King's defenders.} 12. Nxd7 Bxd7 13. a4 {It looks like an attack, but really White just wants to forestall an onslaught on the queenside, since he's about to shift all hands to a kingside attack.} a5 {Black closes off the queenside, which is not a choice I would have made. Perhaps he misinterpreted White's thirteenth move as an aggressive thrust after all!} 14. Rb1 {Getting off the long diagonal and supporting the b-pawn. A quiet, but necessary step before the Nc3 can leave its post. This also has the advantage of looking aggressive (and indeed, it could become aggressive!), which may cause Black to commit more to the queenside than he needs to. The computer evaluates the position as dead even here.} e5 {This seems to be just a space-gaining thrust. Black certainly doesn't have much room to maneuver right now.} 15. Qh4 {The WQ is actually headed for g3, but this is an attempt to first draw the Black Queen out of position. My thought was that on d8, the BQ would obstruct the QR--essentially, removing another potential defender from the Black kingside.} Qd8 {White's plan has worked! It remains to be seen if it was actually worth something, though.} 16. Qg3 Re8 {I like 16...Qe7.} 17. f5 {A thematic element of the Grand Prix attack (again, from what little I understand of it) is this (or another) kingside pawn break.} Qe7 {I still think this would have been better last move. Now the Re8 is serving no purpose at all.} 18. Rf3 {With the pawn on f5 blocking off Black's light Bishop, White has plenty of time to maneuver his pieces into position for an attack.} Kh8 {Getting the King out of the way and making room for ...Rg8.} 19. Rbf1 {As brigadecommander might say, White is making great use of "lines of communication".} gxf5 {?! Black cracks under the tension in front of his King. It certainly complicates the position, but I think it's premature. The computer suggests an incredibly complex line starting with 19...Bf6 (threatening ...Bh4) 20.Qf2 g5 21.Qg3 Rg8 22.Qg4 Rg7 23.Rh3.} 20. exf5 f6 {? This seems to have been the idea behind 19...gxf5. I think it's the right idea (blocking the f-pawn's advance) but the wrong execution. 20...Bf6 looks much stronger to me: that Bishop is really a huge blockage to Black's troops right now.} 21. Ne4 {White finally brings the Queen's Knight into the game, pointing at f6 and preventing any annoying thrusts from the e-pawn.} Reg8 {This seems logical enough, but I'd be worried about the King's ability to escape... More importantly, perhaps, this does not allow more defenders of h7, which is clearly about to come under fire. The DSB is simply in the way of everything. 21...Rf8 (with an eye to ...Rf7) might have been a little stronger.} 22. Qh4 Be8 {This Bishop desperately needs to get involved.} 23. Rh3 {Of course.} h5 {The only real defense.} 24. g4 {The computer doesn't like this, but I stand by it. As far as the computer's concerned, I should be forcing huge, complicated trades to make analysis easier  with 24.Ng3 Bh6 (getting out of the way!) 25.Bxh6 Rg4 26.Qxg4 hxg4 27.Bf8+ gxh3 28.Bxe7 etc.} Kh7 {?!? The plan here must be to play ...Bh6 without hanging the piece, but I really don't think Black has that kind of time. Now White has an interesting opportunity...} 25. g5 {! No need to take on h5 when White can instead just march his pawn along and force the creation of a passer (25...fxg5 makes the f5 pawn passed, and well-supported). Besides that, he's also threatening something bigger...} Bh6 {? Black tries to use the pin on the g-pawn to stop all the threats against f6 and so on, but White has a simple resource. Once more, why capture, when you can simply advance, and save the kill for a better piece?} 26. g6+ {The presence of the Rook on the g-file makes this situation much trickier than it appears at first. Now, Black's best choice is 26...Bxg6! where 27.fxg6+? loses steam against 27...Rxg6+. So White must find the right continuation in 27.Nxf6+! Kh8 and now 28.Bxh6 should win for White eventually, but the position is rife with complex tactical opportunities for Black, based on the open g-file and the possibility for discovered attacks between the two Queens and elsewhere.} Kg7 {?? It's tough to see, but this actually loses outright. It's now mate in 7: try to find it before going on. The line I gave above was the way to keep playing.} 27. Bxh6+ {Clear enough, I think.} Kxh6 {The longer line was 27...Kh8 28.Qxh5 Qh7 29.Bf8 Rxg6+ 30.fxg6 Bxg6 31.Qxg6 Ra7 32.Nxf6 Qxh3 33.Qg8#.} 28. Qxh5+ {Mate in one.} Kg7 29. Qh6# {1-0. Many thanks to my opponent for another great game. I hope those of you reading enjoyed watching this attack; comments are always welcome as I'm sure I've missed things. As always, thanks for reading!}
