1. c4 {an interesting game, because it looked like nothing got wrong from one side or another... just a little bit margin appeared, and it was just enough...} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e4 e5 {symmetrical... not my favorite with the english, but black decides...} 5. d3 h6 6. Be2 Be7 7. Nd5 {i like to open the c-line. I think it is the best way.} d6 8. h3 Nxd5 9. cxd5 {opening c-line} Nd4 10. Nxd4 exd4 {black opens e-line. Planning probably f5 -which i hate...} 11. Bg4 {a little bit provocative} O-O 12. O-O Bg5 {ping-pong?} 13. f4 {take that, buddy} Bh4 {i did not expect this... I think it is dangerous.} 14. Bd2 {preventing the queen to go on queen-side... i didn't think about e1... no. no. no} b6 {so, the queen did not intend to go this way :-)} 15. b4 {i really wanted to open this file...} Ba6 {good play} 16. Rf3 g6 {i see what you mean: my bishop or my d-pawn... you fox} 17. g3 {take that!} Be7 18. h4 {and I save my bishop and my pawn} h5 19. Bh3 Bc8 {this is where i started to figure that, maybe, the c-line was not so interesting... Normally in englis opening, white attacks on queen-side. But, here, my pawns are largely dominating on king-side, so, why not transbord the battle?... that's what I figured here, by...} 20. f5 {yes, he cannot take it without a real prejudice...} Kg7 {preventing the attack on h-pawn in case the exchange is done on f-line.} 21. Qe2 {intending to double the rooks} Bf6 {i said to myself: this is strange: in case of f-line opening, the bishop becomes a target...} 22. Raf1 a6 23. Rf1f2 Ra7 {ah you protect the f7 pawn... good idea} 24. Qf1 Qe7 {this seemed to me overcharged... you'll see why...} 25. Kg2 {preventing an exchange in case i do it first, so my queen can concentrate on f-line, not on the bishop.} Qe5 {well that is definetly a mistake. But it was not decisive, because i already had the idea, and it only gave me a tempo.} 26. fxg6 {my turn} Bxh3+ {you turn} 27. Kxh3 {my turn} fxg6 {you turn... and it seems that everything is all right...} 28. Bf4 {but here is my new weapon!!!!!} Qe8 {of course not Qe7 29. Bg5!} 29. Bh6+ {!!} Kxh6 30. Rf3xf6 Rxf6 31. Rxf6 {threatening the real target: d6!} Kg7 {renounce to defend d6, because any protection would be followed by Qf4+} 32. bxc5 {I had to do it first to prevent a further re-take by him} dxc5 33. Rxb6 {d6, b6, it does not matter, now, my e and d pawns are free!} Rf7 34. Qe2 Qf8 35. Kg2 {blocking any attack} Rf6 {well simplifying was my idea, so, thanks} 36. Rxf6 Qxf6 37. Qb2 {i take the only free coumn} Qd6 38. Qb7+ Kf6 {well that is definitely a mistake... but anyway there was no more escape} 39. Qc6 Qxc6 {maybe Ke7 was better} 40. dxc6 Ke6 41. e5 {and this is the key...} a5 42. Kf3 a4 43. a3 Ke7 {almost zugzwang.} 44. Kf4 Ke6 45. Ke4 {zugzwang... he cannot let me pass on d5... but he has no option. even before the 42nd move, the breakthrough by the c and d-pawns lead to nowhere: my king covered... resigning was a good guess...}
