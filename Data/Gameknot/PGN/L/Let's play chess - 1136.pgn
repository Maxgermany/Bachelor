1. f4 h5 2. Nf3 h4 3. Nc3 e6 4. b3 a5 5. e3 g5 6. Nxg5 e5 7. Bc4 Nh6 {This was a mistake...} 8. Qh5 {He's in some trouble here.} d5 {Useless move... more free pieces for me.} 9. Bxd5 Rh7 {Also a mistake... merely a stall, given the circumstances. He probably should have stepped his queen up. It would have saved him a lot of grief.} 10. Nxh7 Bg4 {Not a terrible move, but not a great one, either.} 11. Qxe5+ {More free pieces.} Be7 {And the pain continues. If that were a knight instead of a bishop, this would have gone a lot slower, given 12.Qh8 ...Kd7 13.Nf6 ...Kc8, at least giving him temporary respite, surrounded by his pieces. But given the eight point advantage, this game is already decided.} 12. Nf6+ {Didn't really think this one through. Useless check.} Kf8 13. Nh7+ {Didn't really think this one through either. Yet another useless check.} Kg8 14. Ng5 Bxg5 {Bad trade on his part.} 15. fxg5 {Here I'm starting the pawn pressure. Standard procedure would have been; I'm ahead, even trades equals good. However, the pivotal part my Queen was playing said that wasn't really an even trade.} Nd7 {Not the best of moves. Yes it gets a piece out, but it further weakens the Queen and allows extra time for my Queen to move to a better position, Qf4, meaning he loses at least one piece.} 16. Qf4 {Viol√°, I get a piece.} c6 {Still wary of the f7 pawn... a little too late, might I add. Still more pieces for me.} 17. gxh6 cxd5 18. Qxg4+ {He should have started to run, and fast.} Kh7 {Here's where he really messed up. Rather than seeing the mate and beginning his run, he stepped into the pawn and cast his death in stone. Might as well have pressed conceed....} 19. Qg7# {}
