1. d4 {Un bel sacrificio, anche se tematico. A nice sacrifice, even if thematic.} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bf4 c6 4. h3 Nbd7 5. c3 e6 6. g4 {A strong set by black...? Yes, but my attack goes just into its weak point. } Be7 7. e3 O-O 8. Qc2 c5 9. Be2 cxd4 10. exd4 Nb6 11. Nbd2 Bd7 12. Ne5 Rc8 13. g5 Ne4 14. Nxe4 dxe4 15. h4 {Everything as predicted. After f6, I don't see any clear advantage but positional. } Bc6 16. Nxc6 Rxc6 17. Qxe4 Qd5 18. Bd3 {The queen's exchange gets a well placed bishop pair... this center fight is interesting. } g6 {I think that exchanging queens black would have stayed with an even position... but with a pawn less for my opponent, and a most well placed bishop pair. But now it is my turn to attack.} 19. h5 Bd6 {I wouldn't exchange queens since I don't want his knight to come into the game. But the position is still too even to set a clear advantage. I thought a lot what to do here. } 20. Bxd6 {My black bishop, in this position, is almost useless, so I exchanged it. I didn't fear too much the threat BxB, QxB, QxRh1, but it must be met, certainly. } Rxd6 {Ok, he doesn't want to exchange queens, so I have to play aggressively and use MY queen to attack. I found a nice move...} 21. Qh4 Rd7 {Now, I feared e5, but I have my own threat over his king, and he retired to d7 thinking that the exchange in g6 allowed his rook to cover h7. But I had already the sacrifice Bxg6 in mind. } 22. O-O-O {So I tempted him, with lots of calculations and shaking because of...} Qxa2 {aha, he did it. Ok, now it is time to see if my calculations were right or not. Note that Nc5 threats badly a mate in b2, and I must lose my rook with Rd2 (or lose my beloved bishop). So, all my strategy was based on one tempo. Very risky. } 23. hxg6 {Threats mate, so he must...} Qa1+ {Mistake! He loses a tempo here, a very important one. } 24. Kc2 {The queen must move} Qa4+ {MUST give check, but I won a tempo here because...} 25. Kb1 {...because he allows my king to block the a1 check, and it will take now TWO tempos to build the mortal threat on b2!} fxg6 {Now, I was tempted to play inmediately Bxg6, but the threat of a future QxR+ prevented me to play it. Because I had really nothing after 26. Bxg6, h7xg6, 27. Qh8+, Kf7, 28. Qf6+, Ke8 (or mate), and the only way to go on is 29. Rh8, but then QxRd1+ and he has a perpetual check or more. So I played the simple, but mortal...} 26. Rde1 {A beauty. Now his queen doesn't threat my rook, and my rook is doing something. All my pieces are active now.} Qb3 {First move of the mortal threat Nb4, since Re2 will be met by Nxf3+ and I lose quality at least... but it takes him another move to build that threat, so I played...} 27. Bxg6 {And now, he has no time: if Na4, 28. Bxh7+, and in any variant I win or I get a good advantage.  28. Bxh7+, Kg7,  29. Qh6+, Kf7,  30. Qf6+, Ke8,  31. Bg6+ and wins,   28. Bxh7+, Kf7,  29. Qf5+!, Ke8, (note that other checks leads to nothing, then allow black to play Nxf3+...) 30. Bg6+, and at least white can stop the Nxf3 threat, but also has advantage and still attack, or, the best for black,  29, ..., Ke7, and white can still play Qd2, protecting everything* and staying with a pawn more (since it will lose one).  * Maybe black can try something like Rf8xf2, but I didn't see anything special about that.   Best move for black? Maybe he can try Rf3, that allows more space to the king, but it doesn't save it anyway.  } hxg6 {Well, now I win a rook, minimum, through a forced combination... can you see it?} 28. Qh8+ Kf7 29. Qf6+ Ke8 30. Rxe6+ {}
