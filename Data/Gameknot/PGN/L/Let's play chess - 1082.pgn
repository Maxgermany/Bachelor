1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {Bishop Opening} Nf6 3. Nf3 {?!} d6 4. d4 {transposed into Petroff Defense} Nc6 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. Qxd8+ Nxd8 7. O-O Bd6 8. Bg5 {Idea behind this move is to capture either f6 knight to double pawn or d8 knight and after KxB, Black cannot castle.} Be6 {Exchanging the bishops for White is useless.} 9. Bb5+ Nd7 {Reason bhind white bishops on b5 and g5 was also to make black move f6 and c6 as then black knights will not find good squars.} 10. Nc3 c6 11. Rfd1 {! if PxB RxB and Black got double pawns.} Bc7 12. Be2 f6 13. Be3 O-O {Although black knights are not on right places however fortunately Black's minor pieces have good control on d-file.} 14. Nh4 {Going to f5. If BxN PxB White got double pawns but Black gave one of his bishop. A dubios decision, however still thinking ... as it worked in future because it cleared the way of f3 pawn.} Nf7 15. Rd3 {White has no hurry to move the knight to f5.} Nb6 16. Rad1 Rad8 {if 16 ... Nc4 Bc1} 17. Rd3xd8 Rxd8 18. Rxd8+ Bxd8 {What a beautiful position, all minor pieces no any major.} 19. Bxb6 {!? this move is actually "future deciding" move.} Bxb6 20. Na4 {White gave up a2 pawn voluntary.} Bxa2 21. Nxb6 axb6 22. b3 {Now Black got double pawn and his bishop is trapped.} g6 23. Kf1 {Someone has to go to prisoned bishop to kill.} Nd6 24. f3 {Bd3 was bad.} b5 {?? This move costed the game to Black, if Black played c5 and c4 direct he could escape his bishop, not only his bishop would be free but also he would get queen side pawn majorty and possilbly win the game. So looking to this positon White's 12. Bxb6 was not good decision, but as you see it is not easy to calculate/predict so further, specially when simple pawn move can cost the game. So lesson is "When you move analyse it as further as you can otherwise you can simply lose even by a simple innocent pawn move."} 25. Ke1 {Due to b5 White got time} c5 26. Kd2 c4 27. Kc3 {King on right time at right place.} cxb3 28. cxb3 Bb1 29. Kb2 {Black has no way except ...} Bxe4 30. fxe4 Nxe4 {As you see b5 not only did a bad job but also this soldier moved to a place from where White's sniper got a clear and easy shot.} 31. Bxb5 {and man down} Nd6 32. Be2 f5 33. g3 {White didn't move the knight as it is not clear yet where to move.} Kf7 34. Kc3 {Look White's only winning chances are on queenside if he wants to win.} Kf6 35. Nf3 g5 {Look black knight on d6 is on good outpost and is the ONLY good outpost for him.} 36. Nd2 g4 37. Kb4 h5 38. Kc5 {Knight has to move now, if he moves then b7 pawn will die if he does not then ...} Ke6 39. Nc4 {Exchaning B for N will be bad.} Nxc4 40. Bxc4+ Kf6 41. Bd5 f4 {b6  may be good as after KxP, king will move more away from black pawns and there could be any ycounterpaly.} 42. Bxb7 Kf5 43. Kd5 {! Black king must not let to go to other side of the board.} fxg3 44. hxg3 h4 45. Bc8+ Kg5 46. gxh4+ Kf4 47. Bxg4 {!!}
