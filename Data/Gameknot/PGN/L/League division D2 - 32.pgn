1. e4 {Was asked to annotate this game for the purpose of improvement by Nathan. He says he GAMBITED a bunch and it paid off. I believe he meant that he countered a bunch. Its always nice to have some contempt towards the opponent. In other words, don't always reply as he wishes. If you do, then he simply controls the entire game with initiative and momentum. } c5 {Sicilian Defense} 2. Bc4 {Bishops Opening for white. The trouble with bringing the bishop to c4 prior to black playing e5 is that now black can play e6 and have the bishop bite on a chain of pawns. } e6 {Guess black knew this!} 3. Nc3 {Continueing with the normal Italian developement.} Nc6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. d4 {White trying to open the game up.} cxd4 6. Nxd4 Bb4 {Pinning the Knight to the king and prepares to castle.} 7. Ndb5 {Getting creative: defending the c3 knight, if black plays BxN then NxN preventing doubling of the pawns if white replied PxN. Also eyeing the juicy square d6 for the knight.} a6 {Shoe horsey!!!  What black could have done here is a tactic common in games with B at c4. That being 7...... Nxe4, 8. Nxe4 oh! wait white can't reply that way due to the pin. The tactic would continue -8.d5 forking white.                                                                                                                  So the best move for black is 7.......Nxe4 defends d6 and 8.Qd3 or 8.Qe2 is met by d5. If 8. Bd3 then black plays Nxc3 and white either replies bxc3 or (Nxc3 then Bxc3 followed by bxc3 anyway). This leaves white with double isolated pawns = a major weakness.   Even 7.....O-O is better for Black on 7.....Nxe4, Qf3 or e2 or g4 is okay for black as the knight capture is again met with the d5 fork.} 8. Nd6+ {If BxN then white plans QxN and black has a cramped position and unable to castle either side. So black forfeits castling by moving the king. Initiative to white still.} Ke7 {Kf8 safer place. } 9. e5 {Guarding the knight but Bf4 was stronger as it gets another piece into the fray.} Ne8 {Why not 9.....Nxe5 its hanging and the initiative goes back to black as the bishop at c4 is under attack. Maybe this is what Nathan meant by gambiting. A true gambit gives up material for either the iniative or position and is usually part of an opening series of moves.} 10. Bg5+ {The best here. Gets another piece into the fray.} f6 {The only move as moving the king is fatal to the queen.} 11. Qf3 {Stopping fxg5 as then Qf6 is mate. } Bxd6 {Trying to simplify things.  Here black missed a strong move (Nxe5) this forces the queen to move and also guard the hanging bishop at c4. After the queen moves to e2 then white still has two pieces in jeopardy, the knight at d6 and the bishop at g5.} 12. exd6+ Nxd6 13. Nd5+ Kf7 {After things simplify more, black decides not to take at d5. This again is a mistake as after the knight capture white will also lose another piece as two are still in peril. Black would have the two knights to block in the open position.} 14. Bf4 {Saving the bishop and attacking the knight but this forces the knight to move or be guarded. What better place then c4, capturing a piece. I liked Bb3 here for move 14. as exd5 is met by Bxd5 and check. getting a pawn at least for the piece and opening the front door for an attack. } Nxc4 15. O-O-O {White could of moved the knight back to c3 or e3 but would be a piece down and black could play R to e/ f 8 and then K to g1 a type of false castling.    Black also had a strong candidate move in 15.....Qa5 starting an attack of his own which requires white to react and give up his attack for the moment. Intiative to Black.   Black must have seen 15....exd5, 16. Qxd5 with check and the loss of the c4 knight.} e5 {A counter to whites attack.} 16. Qb3 {A miscalculation for white. } Nc4a5 {This again puts two pieces in trouble for white.} 17. Qb6 {Offering to trade queens and then gets to back-off the bishop after QxQ,NxQ,rook moves.} Qxb6 {Ouch! black didn't need to give in to whites plan as exf4 is fine due to the rook guarding the queen.} 18. Nxb6 Ra7 19. Be3 {Now white is looking much better. White is down a piece but has the discovered attack on the rook yet to play. Rook to b8 was called for as it would of prevented this. Leaving the rooks on the back rank and able to be connected is usually good. } Nd4 {Blocking the tactic.} 20. c3 {Removing the blocker. } Nf5 21. Nxc8 Nxe3 22. Rxd7+ {An intermezzio (inbetween move) that helps white greatly. Gets the rook out of trouble and allows the capture of the black rook.} Ke6 {Was Ke8 better? } 23. Rd6+ {23.Re7  is stronger as it flushes the king out from behind his pawn wall to f5. Kd5 allows Rd1  and gets another heavy piece into the mix for white.} Kf7 24. Nxa7 {Finally whites plan is done. He is now ahead in material, the difference of a rook vs. knight.} Nxg2 25. Rg1 Nc4 {Offering rook for rook.} 26. Rd7+ {Don't think so!} Ke6 27. Rxb7 Nf4 28. Rgxg7 {Taking the g pawn earlier maybe not such a good idea now. White has two connected rooks on the 7th rank, a real strong battery.} Kf5 29. Nc6 Ng6 30. Rgxh7 {Its free.} Rxh7 {When behind in material and you trade pieces it makes for more of a difference in compareable strenghts. Say 11 vs 13 is better than 8 vs 6. The fewer pieces the least trouble you can generally make for your opponent.} 31. Rxh7 Kg5 32. Ne7 Nxe7 {This gives white a won game. I would prefer Nf4 as the two knights can be troublesome at times. Again trading pieces makes the difference more noticable.} 33. Rxe7 {White is ahead in material and has a simple win ahead. In hindsight: black had several chances to equalize and even pull ahead. Black just missed more things than white did.  Hope I was clear in my annotations and this was instructive.}
