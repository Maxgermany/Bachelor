1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5 {The thematic position.} 3. d4 {The theory prefers 3. exf5 or 3. Bc4} fxe4 4. Nxe5 Nf6 5. Be2 {?! Not very active. 5. Bc4 sounds better.} d6 6. Nc4 Be7 7. Bg5 d5 {? A positional blunder. Now, my knight can go on e5 with safety. White has a positional advantage here. +=} 8. Ne5 O-O 9. O-O {?! 9. c4 !? could be interesting too...} Nbd7 {! Now Black are suppressing my splendid knight. The position is equal now. After 10. c4 dxc4 ==  ==} 10. Nxd7 {?! Not the better. 10. f4 keeps the control of e5.} Bxd7 11. f4 {!? Curious. I think it's not bad, but the control of e5 don't help White, the knight will take too much time to go to. This move "condemns" a bit the bishop too, he must lose two-three tempis  for repositionning correctly.} h6 {Kicks the bishop out of g5.} 12. Bh4 c6 13. Nc3 {!? 13. Nbd2 ! followed by 14. c4 appears better.} Qc8 {?! Doesn't attack anything. The threat 14... c5 15. dxc5 Q or Bxc5+ doesn't give any advantage for black. White gains a tempi. +=} 14. Rb1 {? And loses it immediately. Maybe 14. h3 followed by g4 and f5 would be interesting.} Bb4 {? Frees a piece from the attack. 14... Rf7 !? followed by Bg4 leaves a small advantage to black. '} 15. a3 Bxc3 16. bxc3 Ng4 17. Bxg4 {?! 17. h3! could be better : 17... Nf6 18. Bxf6 Rxf6 19. Bg4 ! +=} Bxg4 18. Qe1 Qd7 19. h3 Bf5 20. Qe3 {!? Maybe 20. g4 !!? is better.} Rae8 21. g4 Be6 {? Poor bishop ! 21... Bh7 is better. } 22. f5 Bf7 23. f6 {!! The attack  begins.} g6 {? If 23... gxf6? 24. Bxf6 ! Attacking and threatening 25. Qxh6 with mate. The only move was 23 ... Be6 +=} 24. Qxh6 Be6 25. Qxg6+ {+-} Kh8 26. f7 {!! The end of the white attack. Black loses material.} Rxf7 {Leaves at least a piece for white. But, if 26... Bxf7 27. Bg6#} 27. Rxf7 {!} Qxf7 28. Bf6+ {Black must give his queen for stop the mate. Marillion resigned here. I hope you enjoyed this game !  Villiers}
