1. e4 {i am curious, what other players critique of this game may be. I find it very interesting to read what someone else might see in the game. especially at move 6.  when the queen comes out and is forced to move about.  thanks} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 Nxd4 6. Qxd4 b6 7. Nc3 Bb7 8. Bf4 Nf6 9. O-O-O Bc5 {i know my queen is under attack and will be a main focus for his army while out in the middle of things, but i do believe i have a much better position. especially after o-o-o; his forces are pointed toward the kings side of the board. My forces are attacking the middle and kingside.  He should castle queenside to equalize.} 10. Qe5+ Be7 11. Bd5 d6 12. Qd4 Nxd5 13. Nxd5 {after taking the bishop here whith the knight o-o-o looks even better.} O-O {i think o-o was ill timed and in the wrong direction. i think he should of focused more on preserving his black bishop and moving his queen off the back row for o-o-o.  with that as the his goal my forces could have been pushed back and delayed.} 14. Nxe7+ Qxe7 15. Rhe1 Qd7 16. Rd3 Qg4 17. Bxh6 gxh6 18. Rg3 Qxg3 19. hxg3 Rae8 20. f3 d5 {he did not realize the danger his king was in is only reason for this move} 21. Rh1 Kh7 22. Qf6 Re6 {this move baffled me at first, I couldn't understand why?} 23. Rxh6+ {}
