1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann is one of my favorite defenses. Black has all the advantages of the french and none of it's weaknesses. The only two weaknesses of the Caro-Kann are that black usually is a little worse in the endgame and white has an enduring space advantage. But in this game I choose to play a risky varation of the Caro-Kann; the Little know Bronstein-Larsen defense. } 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Bc4 {Karpov Classical mainline} Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ {Here White chooses to exchange on f6 immediately Black has three main options  1. 6. ...Ndxf6 with an interesting game. 2.  play exf6 which leads to the Kornchoi defense 3. As I play gxf6 of the bronstien-Larsen Caro-Kann varation. } gxf6 {This is in my opinion an inferior move for black and is not for beginner players. I play it from time to time to spice things up. If black can survive the first wave of attacks by white he can usually get good counter play along the g file. This is known as the Bronstein-Larsen formation.   Black's strategy is simple 1. Place the H rook on the g file where it will eye the weak g2 pawn. 2. Develop the bishops to the King side. 3. Prepare for a f6-f5-f4 pawn break. 3. Castle Queen side. Amass huge pressure on the g file by playing Qg5, or Qh5. Of course that is if he can do all that before white deals a quick blow! However, as seen in this game Black has major weakness , but it is not easy for white to exploit it with accurate play. Thus, after black endure the initial attack he can usually mount a sufficient attack along the G file, or white's weak d5 pawn.   Black can also play exf6 moving into the Kornchoi variation. In that setup black has strong defensive and attacking chances. see this game for an  example: http://gameknot.com/chess.pl?bd=5122032} 7. Qh5 {This move aims at the heart of Black's weakness. White can also try the quiet 7. c3, or Nf3. As strange as it may seem I do not think this is Whties best reply . I played a similar game against a player rated above 2000 which I managed to easily draw. } e6 {The advantage of Black's gxf6 plan is that it creates an open g file from which to launch an attack. As well, Black has an extra pawn in the centre to mount a timely push in the centre if white gets carried away. } 8. Ne2 {better is Nf3, however the threat of Nf4 is sufficient to give black pause. } Nb6 {Gaining tempo on the bishop on route to d5} 9. Bb3 a5 {I could actually do way with this move. I played it with the idea of queen side plans in the future. But thinking about it now it creates more weaknesses that out weigh it strengths. } 10. a4 {A move that is natural and forced. White can not allow a4. } Nd5 {These long knight manovuers are characteristic of the Bronstein-larsen varation.} 11. O-O {White could capture on d5 but would give up the bishop pair. Usually it is not wise to exchange pieces so early especially bishop pairs. You never know if you are going to miss them!} f5 {making room on f6 for the bishop or knight as well as breaking communication between White's bishop and queen on d5. This effectively splits board in half.} 12. Bg5 {it is pretty hard to resist this move with a gapping hole on f6} Nf6 {so far despite Black's inferior 6th move White has not found a real way of exploiting the weakness. Matter of fact, black is slowly consolidating his position. } 13. Qh3 {Qh4 would have been better. } Rg8 {exploiting White's inferior queen move.} 14. Qh4 {and black's point is proven.} Bg7 {The bishop on g7 has two purposes. 1. to defend f6  2. To attack White's weak d5 pawn} 15. Rfd1 {c3 would have been better. This would ensure domination of the centre. As well it would put the b7 bishop out of position. } b6 {this is a waiting move. It also allows the bishop to be developed to b7 or a6 if need be. } 16. Bc4 {prevents the b5 break} h6 {removes the pin and forces White to clarify the position} 17. Bxf6 {Bf4 was clearly stronger. The text move allows Black to equalize. } Qxf6 {The exchange of queens would be in favor of black.   18. Qxf6 Bxf6 and Black's king side comes alive. } 18. Qg3 {avoids the exchange. } Bd7 {prepares queen side castling. Although the king is much safer in the middle. Such positions often defy traditional chess principles. } 19. Qb3 {Threatening Qxb6 and putting pressure on e6} Qg5 {This forces White to create a weakness in front of his king. It also does not give time for White to carry out his plans for e6 or b6. For the next few moves I employ a defensive strategy of Distraction. Meaning I stir up enough trouble that does not allow white to carry out his plans.} 20. g3 {If White plays Qxb6 then 20 ...Bxd4 wins.} Rb8 {defends b6. It also means that my king is stuck in the centre, but for now it is the safest place for him to be. } 21. Rd3 {I think Nf4 is better. It adds to the pressure on e6. } h5 {a risky move that seems to give white pause. The threat is to smash a hole in the king's pawn defense. Black is playing without fear and vigor.} 22. Kg2 {White seeks to add to the defense of g3.} Qd8 {After I played this move I regretted it. I should have tried 22. ...h5. But my worry was that h5 is premature and I wanted to wait and see if White would become impatient and attack e6 prematurely. After which my mobilized king side pawn storm would have some teeth.  Still if others want to take this position where I feared to tread be my guest. I think h5 is playable. A possible continuation may be:  22. ...h5!? 23. Nf4(White's most active defense) Bf8(maneuvering to d6) 24. Rf3 Bd6 and white holds but black has a slight tactical edge. } 23. Re3 {here I was really starting to worry about the increasing pressure on e6. Someone who wants to play this Bronstein-Larsen variation of the Caro-Kann must have nerves of steel. Yet, in this game white still has not exploited Black's weakness!} Kf8 {Dodges any funny business on e6. And waits to see if white will get impatient. All my pieces are coiled and ready to explode. } 24. Qa3+ {White could have played Nf4 which I think is more in keeping of the spirit of his play. This allows black to gain tempo of the queen. } Qe7 {Again the exchange favors black because it blunts White's attack on e6. After the exchange White's attack fizzles to nothing. } 25. Qc3 {Another inaccuracy. Better is Qb3. Which retains pressure on e6. It is clear that Itking really does not have a concrete plan. So it is a prefect opportunity for me to seize control of the game.} c5 {The critical move that signals that white has let his advantage slip away. Black's bishop pair dominate the board and the d5 pawn comes under heavy attack. Ironically if White had choosen to play c3 at the beginning the position would be level.} 26. Qd3 Bc6+ {This bishop enforces alot of influence from here.} 27. f3 {White feels obligated to create a further weakness in his king's pawn defense. I would be very reluctant to make such moves. I think Kg1 is better.} Rd8 {Exploits White's queen position and gains control of the centre. White's weak d5 is done. } 28. Qb3 Rd6 {I was seeking to defend e6 and b6 at the same time. But after I noticed a strong reply by white 29. d5!.} 29. h4 {White has been very careless with his pawns in front of his King. He creates a massive weakness on g3 which is only defended by the Knight! I suppose he was preventing h5, But he can not prevent f4!  29. D5 was a must!} Bxd4 {This regains the pawn with a huge positional advantage. The bishop can not be taken because of 30. ...Cxd4 which removes the only defender of g3. } 30. Rd3 f4 {The breakthrough! At long last this is the point of Black's 6th move. The major motif of Black's game is to aim for this pawn push. If he is allowed to to play it it usually is lights out for white. Black's king pawns become a one man wrecking crew.} 31. Nxf4 Qxh4 {The position is rip for a mating attack. All of my pieces are concentrated in the king's position. White however, only has the knight to aid in the defence of the king. } 32. Ne2 {attempting to defend g3. } Be5 33. Rh1 {White tries to put up a resistance but the end is never in doubt. } Rxg3+ {removing the remaining defence of the king. } 34. Nxg3 Qxg3+ 35. Kf1 Rxd3 36. Qxd3 Bd4 {threatening mate on f2.} 37. Qe2 Bxf3 38. Qh2 Qg5 39. Qd6+ Kg8 40. Qxd4 {otherwise 40. ...Qc8 is mate. } cxd4 41. Rg1 Bg4 42. Bd3 Qf4+ {After 43. Ke8 Qe3  44. Kf1 Qf3  45. Ke8 e5. }
