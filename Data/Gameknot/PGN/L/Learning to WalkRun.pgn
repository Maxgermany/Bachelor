[Opening "Sicilian (B41), Kan variation"]

1. e4 c5 {So, he asked me what defense I wanted.  Before I started the Baseman Defense thread between my club and WTWLR club, I told him that this was the one.  He said, that it wasn't an option and picked the defense.  It's the once that I'm used.} 2. Nf3 {I also told him that I know how to play against it since I've played the Open Variation against Jack Stockel.} e6 {So, it was agreed that he'd play a variation that I wasn't used to, since I only studied the Open Siclian with my coach.  Therefore, he decided to play the closed defense.  I believe this is the Nadjorf, but could be wrong.  Anyway, getting used to something different still means making the most logical move, and in this case, it's the same variations, as though it were the Open Variation.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Be3 Nf6 6. Bd3 e5 7. Nf3 d5 8. exd5 {??In this position, the idea was to exchange right away which is why I played this.  The idea being is that my OTB coach recently emphasized that it's generally a good idea to exchange early when you're up against a much stronger player.  Especially, players like andywm.  And, there's a little bit of theory behind it, as well.  The reason for this is that the really strong players know how to organize their pieces and get an advantage.  By exchanging, you get rid of that obstacle.  However, this is a time and place to do so.  According to the post game analysis, this is an inaccuracy.  And, best was 8.Nbd2. The reason is that black would 8...Nc6 Note, everything is safe.  The idea being is that the e pawn would remain right on the e file, prevent black from attacking my N and B.  Afterwards, we'd wind up with something like 9.0-0, Be7 10.exd5, Nxd5 11.Nc4, Nxe3 12.fxe3, Bg4 13.Be4, f6 14.Bxc6+, bxc6 15.Qe2  And, I like the way that position looks, as it would result in a good and close game between Andy and I with material even, rather then, 2 points down. Having said that, I disagree that this is just an inaccuracy when it comes to this move.  Looks good, but what looks good might be bad.  And, this is a perfect example.  As it turns, what I played here is a blunder because it loses a piece for a pawn, after he forks my N and LSB with 8...e4} e4 9. Bc4 {?! The idea behind this is that I'm going to lose a piece for a pawn.  And, here, I have to decide what that piece is going to be.  Given that it appears to be an open position, I decided to let him have my N, as opposed to, the B.  So, there is a strategy behind.  According to the post computer analysis, however, this is an inaccuracy.  Best was, 9.Bxe4, with the idea of 9...Nxe4 10.0-0, Bf5 11.Qd4, Be7 12.Qe5, Bg6 13.Nbd2, Nxd2 14.Bxd2, f6 15.Qe2, Bxc2  This time, I agree that it's just an inaccuracy, but not for all of the reasons that the computer outlines except for the beginning, as it mentions 10.0-0  From my POV after 9...exf3, it will no longer be safe to castle K side.  And, even with best play, now K exposure is something to worry about.  So, already, black has a noticeable advantage.} exf3 10. gxf3 b5 11. Bd3 {The idea wasn't just a retreat, but to establish a strong bishop pair.  They say when your B's are only one space from each other, whether vertical or horizontal, you have a strong bishop pair.  According to the analysis, however, this is a mistake.  Best was, 11.Bb3, then comes 11...Bb4+ 12.c3, Bd6 13.a4, Bb7 14.axb5, axb5 15.Rxa8, Bxa8 16.Qd3, b4 17.Nd2, bxc3 18.bxc3, 0-0  Unlike before, however, I disagree with this analysis.  In my mind, this move is just as good and effective as Bb3.  First, I looked at the result of this variation compared to what happens here in the 7 moves, and I like the position just as well.  Second, this move establishes the double bishop, I like to call it, whereas, the other move does not, since they would not only be one space from each other.} Nxd5 12. Be4 Nxe3 13. Qxd8+ Kxd8 14. fxe3 Ra7 15. Nc3 Ke8 16. O-O-O f5 17. Bd3 Nc6 18. e4 f4 19. Nd5 Bc5 20. c3 Be6 21. Be2 Ne7 22. c4 bxc4 23. Bxc4 Nxd5 24. exd5 Bf5 25. Rhe1+ {?? Ok, the idea wasn't just to check, as otherwise, I wouldn't have played.  It was to place him in check by bringing those R's together, or as some call it, communicate both R's.  It's said that this kind of check is dangerous.  And, I've won a couple of games with these types of checks.  According to the analysis, however, this is an inaccuracy.  Best was 25.Bd3, followed by 25...Bd7 26.Rhe1+, Be3+ 27.Kb1, Ke7 28.Re2, Kd6 29.h4, Rc7 30.Rh2, Bd4 31.Bxa6, Kxd5 32.Bd3, Be3 33.Bxh7+, Bd4 34.Be4+, Ke5  I agree with the analysis.  I checked the position after the variation, and I like it way better then what's going to happen here.  And, it will take less then 9 moves, to feel the negative consequences of this choice.  In fact, the only thing I disagree with, like before is that this is more then just an inaccuracy.  It's an outright blunder.  In addition to what I've already, this move loses a R, for a B.  However, the game is not lost, until later and as I wind up in trouble, I'm getting more and more confident.  Note: The confidence is good because it prevents me from resigning, and prevents, and/or takes away the, "fight or flight" syndrome.  And, by getting more confident in these kinds of situations, this is actually why I've been able to pull swindles, including a game against Jack Stockel, where I was once a piece down and in at a serious disadvantage.  Yet, I was able I got braver and more confident and by doing so, I was able to pull a win against a my coach, despite a lost position.  } Be3+ 26. Rd2 Kd7 27. Kd1 Bxd2 28. Kxd2 Kd6 29. b3 a5 30. Kc3 Re7 31. Rf1 Re3+ 32. Kd4 Rhe8 33. Rg1 {?? I was not intending to win a pawn, here, as it appears here.  The idea was to give black something to think about and make it easy for him to go wrong.  However, his plan all along was for me to take that pawn, for once I did, he would immidetialy mate me, as I found out. Like I said earlier, I keep getting more and more confident.  Two things.  First, according to the computer analysis, this is a blunder.  Best was 33.a3, Be4 34.Rc1, Bxf3 35.Bd3, Bxd5 36.Rg1, R8e5 37.Rg4, g5 38.h4, h6 39.hxg5, hxg5 40.b4, axb4 41.axb4  Second, according to my opponent, this is the losing blunder because with the move played black has an inevitable mating, which I'm soon going to discover.  I think that 33.a3, was actually the only way to prevent mate, in this position.} Rxf3 {And, at this point, he accurately said, "your options are limited at this point...your last R move was questionable."  So, I said, the idea behind the R move was to put pressure on the g pawn.  And, he responded towards the end by saying, "you never should have moved the R to g1. g pawn is nothing at that point esp with all the pressure on your K. The K needs Help."} 34. Bd3 Rxd3+ 35. Kc4 Rb8 36. a3 {Only now do I learn my fate and start losing confidence.  I realize that the game is lost, but will still give anything, until he has an official mate in one.   Any other move, and he has the immediate 36...Rb4#  So, this is the only way, for now to prevent the mating net.  But, as he Andy accurately said, "too late for that now"} Rdxb3 37. Ra1 Bd3+ 38. Kd4 Rb8b5 {Now, he asked, "do you see anything coming?"  And, at first I said no, but when we arrived at this position, I saw an inevitable mating sequence which he was going to exploit.  It's actually a similar situation to a recent quiz by GM Judit Polgar.  Black has a mate in one, and in order to prevent that, the K would have to move.  Well, it's pinned, so that makes it impossible, at that point to prevent mate.  So, I resigned.  Overall, I enjoyed my game against.  But, the moral is something is that he pm'd me, earlier today.  In it he said, "Here's a synopsis of our game from my perspective: You played the King's pawn opening and I defended with the Sicilian defense, Kan variation (Paulsen) and ended with your 5th move according to book play. I thought you played well until your 8th move w/ pxd5. This started troubles for white since I played pe4 and forked your Kn and B and also lead to doubling of your pawns. From here on, I was trying to gain control of the middle while also having your pieces retreat. Once my B checked you on move 25, I wanted to keep the pressure on your K, weaken your defense while hoping you would make some bad moves defending your K. Once my B captured your R on move 25, your K was pretty much exposed w/o much defense on that rank. You did play reasonably well until move 33 with R g1 that I mentioned during our game. Although you didn't have a good move at that point, you abandoned your K and it made it easier for me to attack your K in the middle of the board since I had also brought my K up. From this point on, it was just of me keeping the pressure on, checking your K and winning pieces and exchanging pieces if necessary. Overall, not a bad game to make it last till move 38 but a few mistakes early hurt your play. I hope something was learned from the game."  BTW, I would like to thank andywm for this amazing game, and brigadecommander for the thread, "Are All the Walker's Sitting".  Without it, this game would not have been feasible.  And, I agree that these WTW games are a great way for people to learn and improve their overall games.}
