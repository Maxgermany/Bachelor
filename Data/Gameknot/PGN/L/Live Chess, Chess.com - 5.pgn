1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 g6 {In a chess.com USCF online rated tournament, I had White against a higher rated opponent.} 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 {We are in a King's Indian Defense.} d6 {Now Stockfish likes the line 5. h3 followed by 6. e4.   I have tried to play this before, but prefer the line in the game because it leads to positions different from the normal King's Indian Defense.} 5. Bg5 {Here Stockfish suggests 5... h6 6.  Bd2} O-O { } 6. e3 Nc6 7. Be2 h6 8. Bh4 a6 9. a3 e5 10. dxe5 {White's goal is to open the D file and play along that, but also to expand on the queenside.} Nxe5 11. Nxe5 dxe5 12. O-O {White should have played 12. Qxd8 Rxd8 13. Nd5 g5 14. Nxc7 Rb8 15. Bg3 which favors White by about half a pawn.  One reason this works is that Black played a6 neglecting his development. } c6 13. Qc2 Qc7 14. Rfd1 Bf5 {Better is 14... Be6 } 15. e4 Be6 {White can get a small advantage with 16. Na4 b6 17. f3 (planning Bf2) Nd7 18. b4} 16. Bg3 {This doesn't do much.  Now Black can equalize with 16... b5 17. Nb1 Rfd8 18. Nd2} Nd7 { } 17. b4 {It makes sense to expand on the queenside.   Slightly better for White is 17. Na4 b6 18. f3 Rfb8 19. Bf2 b5 20. cxb5 axb5 21. Nc5 } f5 18. f3 f4 {Chases the bishop to where f2 where it can be more useful controlling the squares on the queenside.} 19. Bf2 Nb6 20. Bxb6 {White wants to play c5 kicking the queen with tempo, with the idea of Bc4, trading bishops, and then manipulating the knight to c4 and d6.  Instead better is 20.  c5 Nc8 (20... Nd7 21. Rd6) 21. Na4. } Qxb6+ 21. c5 Qc7 22. Na4 g5 {Too slow.  After 22... Rad8 23. Nb2 White is only slightly better. } 23. Nb6 {This give Black time to contest the file.  A much stronger plan would be 23. Rd6 Bf7 24. Rad1   The after 24... Rfd8 White has many good choices, like Bc4, Qc3, Qd3 or Qd2. } Rad8 24. Bc4 Qf7 25. Bxe6 Qxe6 26. Qc4 {White is eyeing trading queens and playing Nc4 and Nd6.  The computer prefers playing Nc4 instead.  White's knight is more useful than Black's "bad" bishop. } Kf7 27. Rac1 {Now white would barely have an advantage after 27... Rd4 28. Qxe6+ Kxe6 29. Kf1 Rfd8 30. Ke2.  So slightly better would have been 27. Qxe6+ Kxe6 28. Nc4.  } Rxd1+ {This helps White so much that he now has a winning advantage. } 28. Rxd1 {Now if 28... Re8 29. Rd7+ Re7 30. Qxe6+ Kxe6 31. Rd6+ Kf7 32.  Nc8 Rc7 33. Rd8 Bf6 34. Nd6+ Ke6 35. Rb8 with a winning advantage.} Qxc4 {Helps White get his knight to the strong outpost on d6.   } 29. Nxc4 {If 29... Kg6 30. Rd6+ Kh7 ( 30... Bf6 31. Nxe5+) 31. Rd7 Rb8 32. Nd6 with threats.  Stronger than Nxe5. } Ke7 30. Nd6 Rb8 31. Nf5+ {The game is probably over now.   Play should continue 31... Kf8 32. Rd7 Bf6 33. Nd6 Be7 34. Nxb7 } Kf6 {Fatal mistake.   } 32. Rd6+ Kf7 33. Rd7+ Kg6 34. Rxg7+ {If 34... Kf6 35. Rh7 a5 36.  Rxh6+ Kf7 37. Nd6+ Kg7 38. Re6} Kh5 35. Rh7 {White missed 35. g4+ fxg3 36. hxg3 a5 37. g4#   Now if 35... Kg6 36. Rxh6+ Kf7 37. Nd6+ Kg7 38. Re6 picking up at least one pawn.} g4 { } 36. Rxh6+ Kg5 37. h4+ gxh3 e.p. 38. gxh3 b6 39. h4# {}
