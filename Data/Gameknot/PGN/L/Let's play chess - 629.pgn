1. Nf3 {for a change} b6 {that's new for me.} 2. e4 Bb7 3. Bc4 {trap} e6 {don't fall into it} 4. d3 Be7 5. O-O Nc6 6. a3 {for my bishop, in case, and to avoid a knight on b4} Bf6 7. Re1 g6 {well this is very strange... Look like he constructed an expensive fianchetto } 8. Nc3 Na5 9. Ba2 c5 {looks like he does not want to castle... his knight on g8 is a weakness now... I think from now how to exploit this.} 10. Bd2 Nc6 11. Rb1 Bg7 {finally fianchetto...} 12. b4 cxb4 13. axb4 Nd4 14. Nxd4 Bxd4 15. Nb5 {do you see this beautiful place on d6?} Be5 {well he does} 16. f4 Bb8 17. Bc3 {and his bishop could not protect that diagonal anymore} f6 18. e5 a6 19. Nd6+ {wow i liked that} Bxd6 20. exd6 {brave soldier in front... shall i lose him?} b5 {well i thought about Qb8, but the result is the same.} 21. Bxe6 {sacrifice! } dxe6 22. Rxe6+ Kd7 23. Qg4 {what a beauty here!} Bc8 24. Rxf6+ {well, the next moves were very clear to me... And it seems that it was obvious to my opponent. He resigned here without a word. I have no news from him. Boris, if you want to talk about, be my guest. }
