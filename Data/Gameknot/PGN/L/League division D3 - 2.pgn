1. e4 e5 {As Black I'm most comfortable answering 1. e4 with 1. ... e5} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Again, 2. ... Nc6 is the move I'm most familiar and comfortable with. My only real alternatives would be: 2. ... d6 (Phildor's Defence) 2. ... Nf6 (Petroff's Defence)} 3. Bc4 Nf6 {After 3. Bc4 I would need a very good reason to play anything other than:  3. ... Nf6 (Two Knights Defence) I've played it at least 252 times before (as Black... at Gameknot)} 4. Ng5 d5 {4. ... d5 a standard move I was expecting: 5. exd5 Na5 6. Bb5+ c6 7. dxc6 bxc6 to follow} 5. Be2 {5. Be2 I don't think I've seen this before; it's not on my Personal Games Database (ca 2015.01.19)} d4 6. d3 h6 7. Nf3 a6 8. c3 dxc3 9. Nxc3 Bb4 10. Bd2 O-O 11. O-O Re8 {I've had numerous bad experiences with having my King attacked after I've castled; both Kingside and Queenside. I want to give my e-Pawn some more protection and also allow my DSB to return to f8 if necessary.} 12. Be3 Bxc3 13. bxc3 Be6 14. d4 exd4 15. cxd4 Bg4 16. Rb1 b5 17. e5 Nd5 18. Bd2 Bxf3 19. Bxf3 Nxd4 {White's Pawn looked like it was free (to me).} 20. Bxh6 Nxf3+ 21. Qxf3 gxh6 22. Qg3+ Qg5 23. Qxg5+ hxg5 {I'm happy to have got an exchange of Queens.} 24. Rfe1 c5 {I don't want to lose my c-Pawn, or for it to become a focus of attack.} 25. Rbc1 c4 26. Re4 f6 27. e6 Ra7 {I don't want White's e-Pawn to advance any further.} 28. e7 Rexe7 {With my material advantage I'd be happy to exchange Rooks...} 29. Rd4 Nf4 {I'd like to put a Triple Knight Fork on White with ... Ne2 I don't have much expectation that White will allow this, but it's got my Knight out of harm's way for the moment.} 30. Rd8+ Kg7 31. Rcd1 c3 {I want to constrain White a bit with the threat of queening my c-Pawn.} 32. Rc8 b4 33. g3 Ne6 {This isn't a great place for my Knight. I was considering: 33. Nh3 but I wasn't sure that I would be able to keep it there... and it would be tying up my Knight when I don't have an attack on the White King to follow up with.} 34. h4 gxh4 35. gxh4 Nc7 {To reduce the scope of White's c-Rook. I might have a chance to push the a-Pawn in support of the b-Pawn, my idea being to make the c-Pawn a bigger threat.} 36. Rc1 a5 37. Kg2 Nb5 38. Kg3 Na3 {Covering c2 for a possible future advance of my c-Pawn.} 39. Kg4 Re2 {I might be able to get rid of either White's a-Pawn or f-Pawn next. Either of these would (potentially) give White a semi-open File but I'm willing to accept that chance.} 40. Kf5 {I wasn't expecting this.} Rxf2+ {I don't like how far White's King is advancing into my territory, but the f-Pawn is a free.} 41. Ke6 Ra6+ {I don't want to find out what would happen if my f-Pawn fell.} 42. Kd5 Rf5+ {Pushes White's King away. Bolsters a5.  May help to prevent White playing ... h5.} 43. Ke4 Re5+ 44. Kf4 Rd6 {I'm planning to (possibly) check White with Rd4+ and then play Rde4.} 45. Rc7+ Kf8 {I wasn't sure about this. I was considering moving my King to the h-File, but was worried about the possibility of White checkmating me on the edge.} 46. Rg1 Nb5 {I want another threat to use against White's King.} 47. Rcg7 Rd4+ 48. Kf3 Rde4 49. Rg7g8+ Ke7 50. Rg1g7+ Ke6 51. Re8+ Kf5 {I'd be happy with an exchange of Rooks.} 52. Rxe5+ Rxe5 53. h5 Rc5 {I want to use the threat of c2, c1=Q to halt the progress of White's h-Pawn, it's been a thorn in my side for a while.} 54. h6 c2 {White can't stop me queening now.} 55. h7 c1=Q 56. h8=Q Qf4+ 57. Ke2 Rc2+ 58. Kd3 Qe4# {}
