1. e4 {This game was quite unpleasant for me at times, and i'm glad i won it in the end... Black is very sharp in this game....} e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. f4 {I think it's called the Vienna Game.... it's pretty old ... but it is extremely aggressive, and some variations include many strangely accurate sacrifices... } exf4 4. Nf3 {Immediately preventing the black queen from coming to the H4 square...} Nf6 5. d4 {Development, Offense,  defense...} Bb6 6. Bxf4 {The black pawn was dead from the moment it took the white pawn...} d6 7. Bc4 {another sharp move...} h6 8. O-O {After castling, notice the line of attack for the white rook on F1...} a6 9. Qe2 {Best place for the queen - supporting everything, but not stuck to anything, free to make sharp attacking moves... while everything is supported by something, and wherever the battle starts, white will be at an advantage....black has to develop faster....} Be6 10. Bxe6 fxe6 11. Kh1 {A key defensive move!! The fight should not start before securing the white king out of the line of attack from the black bishop on b6...} Nbd7 12. Rae1 {This is a questionable move.... my reasoning is that i wanted to free my queen and knight on C3; AND make my opponent make a castling choice....} Qe7 13. e5 {I just wanted to put maximum pressure on the knight on F6, and free another file for my rooks, and possibly trap the black king in the center... just testing really....} dxe5 14. Bxe5 O-O-O {He castles on his queen side.....} 15. Qc4 {Immediately i shift my queen in the vicinity of the black king... from this square: i can come back in defense, or i can move ahead and put pressure with my knight and pawns, supported by my rooks if needed......} Kb8 16. Na4 Nxe5 17. dxe5 {Finally.. the battle for the center is over... (for the moment).... and now i have to focus on clearing some files (A, B, C Files) and putting pressure on the black king with my rooks.....} Nd5 18. a3 Ba7 19. Qe4 {i put the queen here to free some room for my C pawn....} g5 20. b4 {A sharp double-edged sword.....} Qd7 21. c4 {Putting him to the test.... whichever way .... i was quite confident....} Nb6 22. Nc3 {Didn't want to exchange on B6 because that would be AGAINST my goal - which was to clear some lines......} Na4 23. Red1 {Last piece of strategic tweaking....} Bd4 {Lame.... until this point black didn't play too badly... but i guess i intimidated him in some way..... he lost focus, and started a series of mistakes........} 24. Nxa4 {Naturally....} Qxa4 25. Nxd4 Qxa3 {Take them ALL.... serves my purpose..... (clear lines for rooks and queen... with some precise side action with the knight..... } 26. b5 axb5 27. Nxb5 Qb3 {questionable.... but what is the to do really?} 28. Rdb1 Qb2 {No comment.} 29. Rxb2 {thnx...} b6 {Last try to fortify his castle....... } 30. c5 {at this point... pretty obvious....  Yet another lame game where an opponent makes mistakes and i take advantage and eventually win...}
