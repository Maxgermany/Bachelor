1. d4 {I've decided to try to actually learn something about the game through effort rather than osmosis, and the first step is going to be looking at my own games.} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {After 2. ...e7-e6 I am still looking for the gambit rather than playing 3. e2-e3, so this allows for variation later.} h6 {Premature; developing a Knight here instead of guarding a non-existent threat would be better.  Or at least if you're that worried about the Bishop on c1, then 3. ...f8-e7 is maybe better.} 4. e3 {In retrospect I prefer 4. g1-f3 here as it develops the piece while Black was clearly playing to the King's-side and would leave the QBP alone.  However at the time I read the early h7-h6 as securing the King's-side in preparation for a Queen's-side game (which I still think was Black's better option).} c6 {A rather hastily set-up Caro-Kann emerges, with no development to keep it alive.  I was expecting 4. ...f8-b4 first to put pressure on, although it wouldn't damage the position.} 5. Nf3 f6 {With one pawn already guarding g5, this is just superfluous (and again, f8-e7 makes more sense, as would 5. ...g8-f6 to develop pieces).} 6. Bd3 {Preparing to castle while developing.  Given that Black had put up absolutely no threats and was pawn-rolling, I expected to take this one into-the mid game and win easily.} Ne7 {I'm not sure where this Knight was going.  Once again I prefer f8-e7 here, with possible continuation 7. 0-0 f6-f5 8. f3-e5 g8-f6.  As soon as the Knight on f3 moves h5 will be open to White's Queen.} 7. O-O g5 8. Re1 f5 9. Ne5 {I learned at one point that if you can take e5 or d5 with a Knight you should do it.  I'm not sure if that's always true, but with the Queen threat present here thanks to Black's advanced pawns and no development, I was all for it.} Nd7 {Tries to contest e5 but misses the larger threat.} 10. Qh5+ {BLAM.} Ng6 11. Qxg6+ {The rest is cleanup.} Ke7 12. Qf7+ Kd6 13. c5+ Kc7 14. Qxe6 Nf6 15. Qf7+ Be7 16. f3 h5 17. e4 fxe4 18. fxe4 Rh7 19. Qg6 g4 20. exd5 Nxd5 21. Qxh7 h4 22. Ng6 h3 23. Nxd5+ cxd5 24. Nxe7 Qf8 25. Nxd5+ Kb8 26. Qc7# {Game.}
