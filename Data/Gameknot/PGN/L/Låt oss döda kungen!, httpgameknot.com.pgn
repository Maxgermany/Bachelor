[Opening "KGD (C31), Falkbeer counter-gambit"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 {Here we got. Black decides to decline the gambit and moreover offers the countergambit. } 3. exd5 exf4 4. d3 {Black could force a loss of the right to castle right now via Qh4+.  Actually I find this move a bit strange, since it locks the white bishop and perhaps that's the reason why this will be the first game in the gameknot DB with this moveorder. (I'll call it the stack variation ;D) } Qxd5 5. Bxf4 {Both players choose to develop } Nf6 6. Nf3 c5 {The next move that confuses me a bit. It locks the Black bishop partly, looks like black wanted a pawn chain directed towards whites Kingside to support a later attack.  Anyway this enables Nc3 (which imho should have been played already). } 7. Nc3 Qe6+ {In the case of white with gain of tempi } 8. Be2 Be7 9. O-O {Although Nb5 looks fu**in tempting white decides on safety first. White has additional threats with 9 d4 xd4 10 Nxd4 or Ng5 } O-O 10. Kh1 {Another safety first move. Of course this move does no harm, imho it's perhaps a bit to early. The bishop can't check from c5 and it allows black to take the initative. } a6 {Thankfully black rejects this offer and decides that Nb5 is too much of a threat. } 11. Ng5 {White begins an attack. } Qd7 12. Nce4 Nxe4 13. dxe4 {And... well sort of ends it here. Well besindes that it had been unclear what white wanted to attack, 13 Nxe4 would've been probably better: No Isolated pawn and a quite nice outpost for the Knight. This leaves the e pawn open to attacks, even so it frees the lightsquared bishop. } Qxd1 14. Raxd1 h6 15. Nf3 {Well well, back where you belong?! White and black overlooked 15 Nxf7 Rxf7 16 Bc4 Pinning the Rook. Or 15 Nxf7 Kxf7?! } Be6 16. c4 {Closing the Queensside. This does not really help white, unless he really wants to attack, which he is not doing right now.. } Nc6 17. b3 Nb4 {Black builds up one move threats which force white to play somewhat unsound moves. } 18. Rd2 Rfd8 19. Rfd1 Rxd2 20. Rxd2 Rd8 21. Rxd8+ Bxd8 {The exchange happens and the Endgame really starts: The Material is even, both players do have their bishops, white has an isolated pawn on the e file. The Pawnstructure of both players is quite ok, so we should be in a quite even position. } 22. a3 Nc6 23. Bd2 Bf6 {White forces the knight off and is probably planning b4. Black however wants to grab the a pawn. } 24. Bc1 Bg4 {Black tries to exchange it's lightsquared Bishop for whites knight. This would enable him to attack or defend a piece with both minor pieces. Further if white plays gxf, whites Bishop is locked. } 25. Ng1 {? as we will see in move 26 ...  White probably did not want to loose the knight, keeping in mind, that this could lead to a problem } Bxe2 26. Nxe2 Nd4 {And here black could have won by Na5, attack b3 and c4 simultaniously. But this way.... } 27. Nxd4 cxd4 28. Kg1 {Both players have an isolated pawn, the black one is even a passed pawn, however it will be hard to hold onto it, since blacks King has a longer route to go. And this is the part in which I really enjoy white's play. There is only one minor piece left and white instantly moves his King towards the center. } Be5 29. h3 {freeing the pawn so that the King can move. White decides to go for the h pawn to advance, so that the black bishop gets useless. Right now there is only one pawn that black could attack with his Bishop. On the otherside, there are 3 pawns on black's side on dark squares. However this alows a saving move for black: 29 ... Bg3! } g5 {Black on the otherside does not do this } 30. Kf2 {White denies blacks Bishop to move to g3 } Kg7 31. Ke2 Kg6 32. g4 {! and black is lost. This is imho a really beautiful setup.  Blacks Bishop has a more centralised position. Blacks King and it's isolated pawn is further advanced, yet there is nothing black can do: It's King is no longer part of the game, as there is no way to get by and attack an enemy piece. Blacks Bishop has only one piece to attack and on the other hand is supposed to defend the pawn. } h5 {An empty threat, since an exchange won't resolv blacks situation! } 33. Kd3 h4 34. Bb2 Bd6 35. a4 {Perhaps this was not neccessary, but why should one not frustrate the opponent? } b6 36. Kxd4 f6 37. Kd5 {Blacks King gets more and more uncofortable. } Bb4 38. Ke6 {Now there are probably a few ways to end this faster. Kc6 or Bd4 f.i. } Bd2 39. Bxf6 a5 {And a passed pawn has appeared } 40. Bd8 Be3 41. Kd6 Kf7 { } 42. Kc6 {42. Kd7 Bf4 43. Bxb6 Kf6 44. Bd4+ Kf7 45. e5 Kg6 would've been probably faster} Ke6 43. Bxb6 Bxb6 44. Kxb6 Ke5 {And the pawns are marching in} 45. c5 Kxe4 46. c6 Kf3 47. c7 Kg3 48. c8=Q Kxh3 49. Kc5 {?! I don't understand this one, but it's won anyway... If he wants to move with the King, why not grab the a5 Pawn?} Kg2 50. Qf5 h3 51. Qxg5 h2 52. Qd2+ {Well done (imho) :)} Kh3 53. Qxh2+ Kxh2 54. g5 Kh3 55. g6 Kh4 56. g7 {}
