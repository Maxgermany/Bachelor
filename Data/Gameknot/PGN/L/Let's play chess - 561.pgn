1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 5. h3 {Transposed Italian Game. Book ended with 4. ... Bc5.} h6 6. Nc3 a6 7. O-O Ne7 {Small error by Black.  Gives up his pawn on e5 for free. I think that I would have done 7. ... d6 before Ne7.} 8. Nxe5 d5 {Another error by Black.  I think he was attempting to trade off to game control of the center.  Has a lot of pieces pointing at d5.} 9. Nxd5 Nexd5 10. exd5 {Black is now two pawns (center pawns) down.  I was expecting Nxd5 in an attempt to even up the material but...} O-O 11. d4 {Here I am able to attack the dark Bishop and attempt to block the g1-a7 diagonal.} Bd6 12. Bf4 {I continue to fight for the center and now have a bit more material aimed at the center than Black does.} b5 13. Bb3 Bb7 {Now black could even up the material a bit.  with Nxd5 attacking my dark Bishop if I take the knight with my Bishop (b3) Black has two Bishops against my Knight and dark Bishop. } 14. Nc6 {Only thing that I could to stop the trade off.  Attack his Queen and force him to take the Knight or Move the Queen.  If Bxc6 then d5xc6 (followed by d4-d5) and I have protected pawns deep in Blacks territory with pawn attacks on b7-d7-e6. This also blocks his c pawn.} Qd7 {Now to exchange the dark Bishops. } 15. Bxd6 Qxd6 16. Qf3 {Have to have more protection for d5} b4 17. Rae1 {I can't take b4.  This would leave d5 open and give Black a free pawn and almost bring us up even in material.  Best that I can see is to take control of the open file e.} a5 18. Ne7+ {Black is fixated on moving pawns forward and does not watch where the knight can go.  Black can only move the king to get out of check. } Kh8 19. Nf5 {I have to continue to attack the Queen to save my pawn on d5.} Qd7 {And again I must bring some support to the center pawn (d5)} 20. Re5 Rad8 {Black is still fixated on d5 and the d file } 21. Ne3 {Again, Black is fixated on D5 so I will continue to defend while developing my pieces and maintain my two pawn advantage.  I am also looking for any error on Black's part.} Ne8 {And this could be Blacks error.} 22. Re1 {I am attempting to keep control of the open e file while protecting d5.  I am not sure what the Black Knight move did.  Don't see that it gained Black anything except to be able to move f6 and attack my rook.} Nd6 23. Nf5 {Black blocked the Queen - Rook - Bishop attack on d5 so I can bring the Knight back to the f5 outpost and also make Black think about what his Knight is going to do.} f6 {I was looking for this move but I did not think Black would do it.} 24. Re5e7 {My rook move forces the queen away and I can break up some more of the Kings pawn defense. } Qc8 25. Rxg7 {A blunder on my part.  I should have used the Knight to capture g7.} Nxf5 26. Rg4 Rd6 27. Rf4 Ng7 28. Re7 Qd8 29. Rfe4 {Not a good move on my part.  This will let Black take d5 and force a trade of Bishops. Only thing that I can do is threaten a Checkmate.} Bxd5 30. Qg4 {If Bxe4 then Qxg7#. so I have saved my rook for now.} Rg8 31. Bxd5 {By taking his Bishop I attack his Rook on g8.  Black must take the Bishop because if he moves the Rook out of the line of fire then it is Qxg7#. } Rxd5 32. Qg6 {The cat is in among the canaries. } Rh5 33. Qxf6 {Now I can pick off a few more of the Kings defenses although I am down a Knight.} Kh7 {Big blunder by Black.  He thinks that he has my Rook pined but a check by the rook and I get the queen.} 34. Rxg7+ {If 34. ... Kh8 then a forced mate with 35. Re7+ (discovery check) RG7 26. Qxg7# The only move for Black is Rxg7 giving up his queen.} Rxg7 35. Qxd8 Rxh3 36. Qf6 Rh5 37. g3 Rhg5 38. Re5 Rg5g6 39. Qf5 {Blacks Rook is pinned and the other Rook is limited to moving one square (g8) while I have a Rook free to move} Kg8 {Attempt to free up his Rooks but I will stop this and drive the King back to the pinned square.} 40. Re8+ Kh7 41. g4 {Now to move up the pawns to force the issue.} h5 42. Qxh5+ {About the only move that Black has} Rh6 43. Qf5+ {Again back to the pin to hold down both Rooks} Rhg6 44. f4 c6 {Slow but sure.  Push the pawns forward for the finish.} 45. g5 Rd7 {Think that Black was just at wits end with this move.  I could take the Rook and move this game into a number of extra moves but will do a check first. } 46. Qh3+ Rh6 {Black could have moved Kg7 and then Qxd7#} 47. Qxh6# {}
