1. e4 {THE LOST GAMES SERIES: This begins my series of annotations I have been meaning to start for a while now that is inspired by a quote from Mikhail Tal that went -not verbatim- "I never learned anything from a game I won". Also, want to do more annotations as I have been reading a lot of them lately and see them as beneficial to my goal to improve my analysis skills, which I really have little of.  it was a quickly played game for the most part and at 54 moves this game went on much longer than I prefer to play.} e5 2. Nc3 {Been doing the Vienna Game after watching some Youtube videos on it. Like the way it can lead into a sort of King's Gambit game and prefer the way develop as opposed to knight f3 on the second move. Not better than just prefer it is all. } Bc5 {Usually prefer black to move out one of his knights here and actually get annoyed at this move. Why?} 3. Nf3 {It makes me do something other than my preferred line of pawn to E4 and then the Vienna Gambit which is a close cousin of the King's Gambit which I have played many games of and so am not too lost inside its weird little world. But here I just want to end the pressure on F2 ASAP. } Nf6 4. Nxe5 {Usually I would have gone pawn to D54 and regret I did not do it this time as the board got a bit too unfamiliar too fast for me, but I am open to trying new things. So what the heck, right?} d6 {Here I anticipate he is going to move his LS bishop to G4, since that seems to be the only move possible followed by a trade of pieces to players here. I do not think it is a great move and regret I did not just move my knight to D4 for some variation even if it is a bad move in the big picture. } 5. Nf3 {Back to F3 and...} Bg4 {the most popular move in the world, except for...} 6. Be2 Nc6 7. h3 Bxf3 {the trade for equal material on F3. I know trading for equal material can be necessary in a game, but if I had a dollar for every time this has happened within about the first six moves of a game I would have, well, quite a few dollars. I think black just sees killing off the knight as beneficial to himself later in the game. I would imagine if he could at least get an extra pawn out of the trade it would be advantageous. I can only think this is the "clear the board of pieces" strategy, which usually leads into a long boring game. But wherever you find chess you find this move.} 8. Bxf3 {Of course my D4 square is harder to protect now as my F3 knight is gone. But as white I tend to handle it a little better than when as black the F7 is under attack. } Qe7 {A classic move you see in the Vienna and Kings Gambit. The queen comes out to E7 to help gang up on the E4 pawn. It often leads to a loss of the queen for black after white has castled and the rook moves to E1 (often with black not moving his queen as he is so focused on that pawn) or a queen trade, which I do not like.} 9. O-O {Looking to get the rook to E1.} d5 10. exd5 Ne5 {Black sees the threat and takes defensive maneuvers. Sometimes they do not. But my opponent is a crafty one. Perhaps a Romulan? } 11. d6 Qxd6 12. Bxb7 {At this point I feel I am doing okay for 12 moves into the game. I am castled and 2 points ahead and the E-file is a bit vulnerable for black. } Rd8 {Expected him to go to B8. I think this is the better move for black but not exactly sure why. I just don't like it, so that makes it a good move for black.} 13. d3 Bb6 {Here is an example of me not trying to figure out what my opponent is up to with a move that makes little sense to me at first glance, so I hurriedly make my next move without thinking it over much, or at all. } 14. Re1 {Of course the idea here with the Vienna and/or King's Gambit is to make it hard for black to castle earier on, even at the expense of material on white's part. That did not work out and so...} O-O {black castles and is fairly safe. There are now 40 more moves to the game. So lets not dwell on all of them. } 15. Bf4 Qc5 {F2 two again under attack and so I see why the DS bishop moved to B6.While not checkmate I would lose my DS bishop, so...} 16. Be3 {attack queen, and then get drifty in my thinking.} Qd6 17. Bf4 {Why I do this again and not take the black bishop (here a trade of equal material being the way to go) is beyond me. I just am not thinking of the game enough, maybe letting my measly two point lead blind me. } Qc5 {Attacking F2 again. } 18. Rxe5 {And what the hell am I thinking!? This may have been a move I made on my iPad2 at 3 in the morning while watching monster movies at the same time. Looks like it. } Qxf2+ {Sure, and then the logical progression is...} 19. Kh1 {yea, yea...} Qxf4 {bye bye DS bishop and one point in material and weakened castled position. No way to sort it out, just a really bad move on my part and there were better options. Gotta live with it.} 20. Re2 c5 21. Ba6 {Suddenly not confident or happy with the game. Just want my LS bishop back in the action though it wastes time and tempo to do so, and to what ends will it even serve me I know not. } Bc7 22. Kg1 {I regret so much not getting rid of that DS bishop. } Nh5 23. Rf2 Qh2+ 24. Kf1 Ng3+ {I kind of think moving one of his rooks to E8 then doing something like this would have been been better, but this is bad enough for me. } 25. Ke1 Nh1 26. Qf3 {Oh God how I hate this type of situation. A feeling of regret, constantly on the defense. } Nxf2 27. Kxf2 {Finally down in material. At the beginning of the game being down a point or two is not so much an issue as it now as the game goes into the end. To me anyway. In some gambit it is common to be down in material and either get it back or have some positional advantage. Here is lost my lead and in a positional quagmire. } Rd4 28. Ne2 Ra4 {Now he just moves moves around and attacks unguarded pieces. it is an annoying way to be played against -as if I will just leave the piece there for him to take- but it has a negative psychological effect on the person on the defense. Getting tired and bored and frustrated. Losing the fighting spirit and need to do something. } 29. Bc4 a5 {A blunder for black here. But I have to wait. } 30. a3 Be5 {Again that attacking of an unguarded piece. It is okay I guess but better had the piece been totally unguarded or there been a pin involved from which there was no escape. By forcing me to move my pawn to C3 he helps me to insure the eventual death of his rook. } 31. Ra2 Bd4+ {The check. I really feel he could have set things up to be more devastating against me. Some guys can't resist that check. Of course I acknowledge my weaker position based on my blunder earlier. Like so many of my lost games it is not that my opponent seems to play so much better, as it is that I have moments where I play inexcusably bad and deserve what I get. Bad, bad boy!} 32. Nxd4 cxd4 {Didn't want to trade the knight. Now in positions and situations where I have to do things I do not want to do. Hate that.} 33. b3 {But here here is a break. I saw this earlier but had no time to work on it. He actually blocked his rook in a few moves ago by advancing his A-file pawn. He probably saw it and was trying to figure out how to get out of the problem thought there is really no escape. I have my doubts now that he is a Romulan. Maybe a Klingon. } Rxc4 {Sure, best move in this situation.} 34. dxc4 {Now I am back in material lead with a passed pawn. He no doubt feels bad over the rook loss and I get a second wind, a sense that my opponent is not beyond making the same type of blunders I am. Yes he is castled but he cannot stay that way in this situation. He has to move his pawns down to go for a promotion. Which he does effectively as we shall see soon enough. } Qe5 35. Ra1 Re8 36. Rd1 Qe3+ {I think a mistake on his part (though we know the end of the story already don't we) since he is one point down and in a better position to tie me up and keep me from getting my pawns up. See this type of move a lot. Trying to hurry things along or the idea of "getting in the other guy's face" sort of approach. Of course it does advance his pawn and it is protected by the rook, so hard to say it is totally bad in any sense. Damned Klingons!} 37. Qxe3 dxe3+ 38. Ke2 {Here I feel I am in a good position to promote a pawn before he can, but I somehow blow it. Well, somehow like by being a human being with a translated toad's brain in his head.  I end up, like him, getting impatient maybe. But I just make a series of weak and bad moves now from which I can't recover later. } f5 39. Kf3 g5 {Here I think I should have laid back for a couple moves and started advancing my pawns and dealt with his pawns in a few more moves, but I start moving my king around and in the end I lost the advanced squares I needed. } 40. Ke2 {See, I wind up having to go back to E2 anyway, to keep his pawn from advancing. I waste  moves I didn't have. } f4 41. Rd5 {This is a good move but a little too late I think. } h6 42. Rxa5 Kg7 {I needed my pawns up a few more squares. I needed to sit back and think earlier. Look at the bigger pictures rather than having gotten blinded by looking at pieces only. I needed to ponder the board and all the places where there were no pieces, but territory that needed to be crossed quickly. } 43. b4 Kg6 44. c5 Kh5 45. c6 Rc8 46. b5 Kh4 {I am back up 2 points but I obviously have a breechable defense with my weak pawn on G2. I cannot guard with my king and prevent promotion at the same time. } 47. Ra7 Rb8 48. Rb7 {My thinking is not bad here but it is, again, a bit too late. He is a couple moves ahead of me. } Rc8 49. c7 Kg3 50. b6 Kxg2 {There is something wrong here. This move works better with the king on the 8 rank of course. I could move my rook to A7 and then my pawn to B2 guaranteeing a queen but again I do not have time. } 51. Rb8 f3+ {I was hoping of course he would take the rook. But he does not have to. } 52. Kxe3 f2 53. Rxc8 {I still hope for a queen to work with my rook. I fail to see a fatal weakness here and needed to move my king towards someplace like B2. But I am desperate and...} f1=Q 54. b7 {Move my B-file pawn up. End of the world move. } Qf3+ {I lose my B7 pawn on the next move and resign in frustration. Not a game without lessons however. So that is why it is the first of my THE LOST GAMES SERIES. Believe me, many more coming. }
