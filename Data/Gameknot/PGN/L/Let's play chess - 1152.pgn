1. e4 c5 {The sicilian.} 2. Nf3 e6 3. g3 {with this move I announce my intentions to play the KIA vs the sicilian. It is much harder to gain then against the french.} d5 4. e5 {this move is used in the KIA to cut off the black kingside from blacks pieces. } Nc6 5. Bb5 {even though I had prepared the fianchetto, plans change....} Nge7 6. c3 {to prepare d4. } g6 {to advance the dragon bishop. My plan: to exchange the dragon bishop and attack the king on the dark squares.} 7. d4 c4 {now the center is indeed closed. Now to prepare my prey.} 8. Bg5 Bg7 9. h3 {to reroute the knight Nh2 g4 and then f6.} O-O 10. Nh2 Qb6 {ohhhh please dont eat me!} 11. Bxc6 Nxc6 12. Qd2 {to keep an eye on b2 for now and also attacking more dark squares.} a5 13. Ng4 Bd7 {?? not seeing my plan?} 14. Nf6+ {Kh8 would have been possible except for the hanging bishop on d7.} Bxf6 15. Bxf6 a4 16. Qh6 {all over. It was actually nice to play with a plan for a change.}
