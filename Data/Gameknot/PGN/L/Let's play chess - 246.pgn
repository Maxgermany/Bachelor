1. e4 e5 2. d3 b6 3. Be3 Bb7 4. Nf3 d5 5. exd5 Bxd5 6. Nxe5 Bd6 7. h4 {I like Qh5 much better. } Bxe5 8. d4 Bf6 9. Nc3 Bc6 {Bb7 might have been better.} 10. Rh3 a5 {Ooh, BxPh4.  Free pawn!} 11. f3 Ne7 {PxPh4 was still available, but Bd7 would also be nice.} 12. g4 a4 13. a3 Nd5 14. Nxd5 Bxd5 15. c3 Bxh4+ {There it is.} 16. Bf2 Bxf2+ {Qe7+ is also decent.} 17. Kxf2 O-O 18. c4 Bc6 19. d5 Bb7 20. Qc2 {Ok, you are ahead 3 points.  Watch out for QxPh7#.  Like maybe g6.} Nd7 {Oh no!  White can now play QxPh7#.  (That hash mark "#" means "game over").} 21. b3 {Nf6 won't do it, white could push a pawn.  You must move g6 or h6, or you risk losing.} Nc5 {You could have gotten away with f5 too (momentarily), but white is unlikely to pass up checkmate much longer. } 22. Qxh7# {}
