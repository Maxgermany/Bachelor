1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 dxc4 4. e4 {Sacrificing a pawn for centre control and piece activity.} b5 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Be2 g6 {On reflection I would prefer 6.....e6 keeping the position Slav/Semi Slav rather than giving a hybrid Slav/Indian.} 7. O-O Bg7 8. Qc2 {Boris Spassky used to play the white position in a similar fashion in the 60's. The Silicon Monster gives the position as a small plus for black but in the hands of a creative attacker.........} O-O 9. b3 cxb3 {I looked at 9....b4 10.Na4 c3 but after 11.a3 a5 12.Nc5 blacks Q-side pawns are ripe for the plucking.} 10. axb3 Bb7 {My first inaccuracy. Houdini2 gives 10.....Na6 as better} 11. d5 {A mouse error. White meant to play the far superior 11.e5 with a small plus.+0.37. 11.d5 is -1.21 according to Houdini2.} a6 {Both 11.....cxd geniusacamel and 11....Nxe4 were superior.} 12. e5 {Looking to open lines and crash through blacks defences} Nxd5 {Two pawns up Q-side majority a computer assessment of -0.83(after the game) for black. I began to fancy my chances of a Walk the walk victory.} 13. Bb2 Nxc3 {Seeking simplification through material exchanges as I had a two pawn advantage.} 14. Qxc3 c5 {Giving back a pawn to unleash my bishop on b7. 14....Qc7 was much better.} 15. Qxc5 Nd7 16. Qe3 {The best move centralising the Q and eyeing blacks k-side.Houdini2 gives this a -0.39 16.Qb4 a -0.62 and 16.Qc1 a -0.62} Rc8 {Contesting the c-file. Houdini2 gives the position as dead equal. It favoured 16.....Nb6 with -0-26 for black.} 17. Rfd1 Qe8 {One of the main differences between 2100 player and a 1800 player is that the higher rated player defends far better. Given the initiative and a clear plan we 1800 players can do quite well but when it comes to defence we can do quite poorly. Here I start to drift I feel I should have played 17....e6 but didn't as I was worried about a future Nd6} 18. e6 {White begins to press and black panics.} Nf6 {18....Nc5 would have kept whites advantage to a minimum but worried about the coming attack black wanted pieces around the K-side.Houdini2 18.....Nc5 +0.07   18.....Nf6 +0.43} 19. Ng5 {Moving more pieces into the attack} fxe6 {Capitulation. 19......Nd5 still held out chances of putting up a stout defence. 20.Qh3 h5 21.Bxg7 Kxg7 22.exf Rxf7 24.Qf3 which the engine gives as +0.46 compared to the played +0.74} 20. Qxe6+ Kh8 21. Qh3 {Threatening mate} h6 {21......was a little better.} 22. Ne6 Rf7 {22.....Rf7 +2.57. Houdini2 gives both 22....Rc2 +0.78 and 22...Qf7 +1.30 as better.} 23. Bd3 {Black resigns. What can be learnt from this game? When the master got into a bad position he hung tough and remained optimistic and when his chances came he pursued the attack whereas black when things got tough started to play weakly before folding. Lesson: Hang tough and be positive that way you're more open to opportunities that come you're way.}
