1. e4 {This is a game between me and RL friend. Basically it was an unrated game to teach me how to win :)} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 {Pretty standard open game thus far. But then I play g3. It doesn't really give me an advantage, I just saw it in the Game DB and decided to play it.} Bc5 {Preparing for the fork} 4. Nf3 {Maybe I should've played Nh3 to prevent the fork. But he won't make it now anyway, as I plan to play d4 and this is the preparation.} Ng4 5. d4 {Danger of the fork avoided.} Bb6 6. h3 {Attacking the horse, not really developing any pieces. I get the advice not to temper with pawnformation too much in the beginning.} exd4 {Counterattack here} 7. Nxd4 Ne5 {But he has to move his knight anyway} 8. Be3 {Backing up, because his Bishop is in quite a dangerous position.} O-O 9. f4 {Pawnformation was fucked on this side anyway. No use to castle this way anymore, so I decide to threaten his knight} Ng6 10. Nd5 {Considering a trade here} Qe8 11. Qd2 {Trying to avoid Ba5} Qxe4 {Queen is attacking a load of pieces, I thought I had to give up something, but then I saw a nice move...} 12. Bg2 {There it is, his queen can only go to one spot without being attacked.} Qe8 13. O-O-O {Castle so my queen doesn't get pinned} c6 14. Nxb6 axb6 15. Nf5 Qe6 {Here comes the queen again, dangerous diagonal attack Qxa2 is possible} 16. g4 {I decide to backup my knight} Qxa2 {One move away from mate!} 17. Qc3 {Now he can't checkmate me, and I can play Qxg7#} Qa1+ 18. Kd2 Qa5 {He's trying to pin my queen} 19. b4 {He loses his queen now! } Qxf5 {Taking away the possible to play Qxg7#} 20. gxf5 Nh4 {Instead of saving his knight he probably should have played f6 here, to avoid me doing it} 21. f6 g6 {Clever move to avoid fxg6} 22. Rhg1 {Now I have to protect my bishop since he's not in any acute danger anymore} d5 23. f5 {Sacrificing my pawn to play Bh6} Bxf5 24. Bh6 Rd8 {I'd have played Re8, to avoid Qe5} 25. Qe5 Bxh3 {Strange move again, sacrificing his bishop for what purpose? He can (and will) play Nf3  to fork my king and a rook if I play Bxh3. But I chose to play it anyway because having a bishop on h3 is a better position. Here I would have played Nd7, putting my queen and a pawn in a fork, making my plan more difficult } 26. Qe7 {Anyway, I threaten his rook first in a way that if he doesn't do anything about it I can play Qxd8#} Na6 {Maybe I would have played Nd7 here, because now his rook on a8 can't move anymore to put pressure on my rooks/king. It would've come in handy later on} 27. Bxh3 {Could have sacrificed my bishop and played Re1 instead, but the eventual outcome would be the same. } Nf3+ {The fork} 28. Kc1 Nxg1 29. Be6 {He can't play fxe6 because of Qg7#, however there are ways to counter my tactic} Kh8 {Basically it's over here. He should've played Rf8, then it would be a lot harder for me to go for checkmate.} 30. Bg7+ Kg8 31. Qxf7# {}
