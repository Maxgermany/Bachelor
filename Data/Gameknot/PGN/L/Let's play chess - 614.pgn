[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03), four pawns attack, Korchnoi variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 {Alehine's defense, new to me, boy was I about to get a lesson in how this thing works.} 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 5. f4 {four-pawn attack - I went this way because I'd rather die fighting then defending.} dxe5 6. fxe5 Bf5 {Here comes a great illustration of how a misstep when you're this extended results in a complete filet of my centre} 7. Bd3 {Please excuse this move...} Qxd4 {And the obviously crushing response} 8. Bxf5 {an ill-fated attempt at material recovery.  If instead Knf3...QxB and I'll eventually be down 5 pts instead of 3  if Kg2...then Be4 and leads to me having half my pieces pinned} Qxe5+ 9. Qe2 Qxf5 10. Nf3 {I'm surprised this knight didn't fall into the giant black hole in the centre of the board where my four-pawn attack used to be} Nc6 11. O-O Qc5+ {I had I gone first with the bishop to e3 I could have prevented the loss of the P on c4} 12. Be3 Qxc4 13. Nc3 Qxe2 {Might as well start trading down and end this quick} 14. Nxe2 Nc4 {Another example of me missing a developmental weakness and hamstringing myself.  Also caused by not moving the bishop to e3 before castling} 15. Bc1 {And the lackluster result, in hindsight,   If instead Bf4, then e5 and I'm still running} e5 {Opening up the bishop} 16. b3 {Need to move the Knight to effective attack the e pawn, also allows me to capitalize on my poorly placed bishop to make him retreat for once} Bc5+ 17. Kh1 Nd6 18. Bb2 {Opening up development and grabbing a diagonal} e4 {Remind anyone of the opening?} 19. Ng5 {D4 would have been another option but I'm not sure either one gets me anything?} O-O 20. Nc3 {clumsily attacking the pawn} Bd4 21. Rab1 {rudimentary} Bxc3 22. Bxc3 {I don't mind this exchange, I'd prefer to keep the bishop as the board clears} h6 23. Nh3 Nb5 24. Bb2 f5 {At this point I am eyeing f4 as a great spot for my knight if I can support with the g and h pawns} 25. Rbd1 {Grab an open file now that the bishop is strong - looking to infiltrate to the 7th row because of where his knights are placed} Nd6 {blocking} 26. Ba3 {looking to win a pawn} Rf6 {the knight becomes a central piece of his setup.  Right now I believe I have a space advantage but I do not know how to use it?} 27. Rd5 {A decent tactical move I believe to win myself a pawn} Ne7 28. Re5 Re8 29. Nf4 {I think at this point I have done a good job of tying up his pieces but I cannot find a way to capitalize and start winning back material.  At a loss on this point I take up position on f4 as planned.} g5 {He (rightly so) attacks right away to prevent my support from g and h arriving.  Again, another example where I should have setup this positional move with support first (such as h4) before making it} 30. Nh5 {A more limited position for one of my only remaining assets, but providing an effective block here and preventing a pawn storm} Rf7 {The question I begin asking myself here is, is there any way to take advantage of his constricted position to back his king into the corner?} 31. Re6 Nd5 32. Rxh6 Ne3 33. Rf2 {My second terrible mistake - really embarrassing.  } Ng4 34. Rg6+ Kh7 {I knew if he made this move I was toast - at this point all I could hope for was a mistake.  My first game against Alekhine's defense and my first game against a non-novice.  A few key learnings but nothing really inspiring here.  Thanks for reading though!}
