1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Nxe4 {less often played.} 4. Qe2 d6 {Less accurate} 5. Qxe4 dxe5 6. Qxe5+ {Up a pawn. I need to drive home this advantage.} Qe7 7. Qxe7+ Bxe7 {This game is very instructional. We must follow the basic guidelines of chess to win.} 8. d4 {Get a pawn in the center.} O-O 9. Bd3 {Develop.} Re8 10. O-O {Castling not for safety, but to develop the rook.} c6 {This hinders black's development slightly as c6 was a good place for his knight.} 11. Nc3 {Now I want the two bishop advantage. I need to trade this knight for one of his bishops. In the endgame play will be on both sides of the board. A bishop can easily watch both sides of the board whereas a knight cannot. With Bishop over knight and a pawn up the win would be very feasible.} Bb4 {He seems to want to help my plan.} 12. Bd2 Nd7 {Better that the Bishop comes out first here the knight blocks the Bishop.} 13. Rfe1 {Challenging the open file.} Nf6 {Defends his rook.} 14. Rxe8+ {This is to force the knight to a less inactive square, even if for only a move, and to activate my other rook.} Nxe8 15. Re1 Be6 16. a3 {Forcing him to make a decision.} Bxc3 17. Bxc3 {I have achieved the two bishop advantage. The won game is nearing. Now if I could trade a bishop for his bishop. And get the rooks off the board. The win will be much closer.} b5 {Weakens c6.} 18. Be4 {Attacks c6 and centralizes my Bishop.} Bd5 {He seems eager to help my plan.} 19. Bxd5 {Bishops off the board check.} cxd5 {Now his d pawn is isolated. A good pawn to attack.} 20. Bb4 f5 {? This drops a pawn. The game is clearly won.} 21. Re5 Nf6 22. Rxf5 Re8 23. Re5 {Trying to trade rooks as I had planned.} Rxe5 24. dxe5 {Notice this also shift one pawn to the kingside for a 4 to two advantage.} Nh5 {A knight on the rim is dim.} 25. Bd2 {Trying to win the knight with g4 next move.} g6 {Escape square for the knight.} 26. Bh6 {This move might seem strange. I have planned and planned to have this advantage and now I want to trade the Bishop for the knight. However Iam up two pawns now instead of one and the knight serves as counterplay.} Kf7 27. g4 Ng7 28. Bxg7 Kxg7 29. f4 Kf7 30. f5 {Hard to stop these pawns.} h6 31. Kf2 {King activity.} gxf5 32. gxf5 Ke7 33. Ke3 Kd7 34. Kd4 a5 35. Kxd5 {Easily won.} b4 36. e6+ Ke7 37. axb4 axb4 38. b3 h5 39. Ke5 h4 40. f6+ Ke8 41. Kd6 {Slightly more accurate is e7} h3 42. f7+ Kf8 43. Ke5 Ke7 44. Kf5 {Instead of getting a Q and chasing his king around to mate I want to mate him quickly.} Kf8 45. c3 bxc3 46. Kf6 c2 47. e7# {}
