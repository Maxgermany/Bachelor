[Opening "Sicilian (B42), Kan, Polugaievsky variation"]

1. e4 {After a careful opening by black, white played an unexpected passive 14.Bf4, that allowed black to gain initiative, and latter a pawn, black improved his position, and although with the king in the centre of the board, managed to keep white's exposed king under constant threats until the game was finally won} c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Bc5 {Sicilian (B42), Kan, Polugaievsky variation} 6. Nb3 Be7 {I prefer this defensive move rather to the main line Ba7, aimed at f2, here at e7 my bishop ha a better scope on both sides of the board, and can be more effective in defence if white ever plays e5 to difficult Nf6's development} 7. O-O Nc6 8. f4 d6 {I'll enter a Scheveningen pawn formation, John Emms on his book "Sicilian Kan", considers this pawn formation advantageous for black, white has a misplaced knight at b3, and as he already played f4, he could go for one of two possible thematic Scheveningen pawn breaks, f5 aimed to take control of d5 and isolate the d pawn or e5 a disruptive attack break, planed to expel the knight from f6 (when played there, or make it harder to play Nf6) and weaken black's king side, black can launch a queen side minority attack and only has to be constantly observant for white moves like f4-f5 or e4-e5, and respond immediately to them...} 9. Nc3 Nf6 10. Qe2 O-O {inviting white to go for it} 11. e5 {and here he goes... white chose the disruptive attack pawn break, now his pawn will be isolated, and black will have a new attack objective, but first I need to move my knight to d7} dxe5 {11.e5 was a novelty never played before... 11.Bd2 was played only once Ly Moulthun (AUS) - Tulevski Vasil G (AUS), Sydney (Australia), 2007, 1-0} 12. fxe5 Nd7 {needed, now we will see a fight for the e5 pawn, white has to defend it with pieces as it is isolated, and Black can throw virtually every piece against it, so it's a counting exercise...  } 13. Qe4 {white forces g6 to weaken the dark squares around my king threatening mate in the process} g6 {forced in view of mate on h7} 14. Bf4 {a bit passive, I expected Bh6, now I have the initiative, again aimed at d5 I'll play Qc7, It also leaves the open d column leaving it for a possible occupation by one of my rooks} Qc7 {if white played Bf4 he fears to lose the e5 pawn, so I'll get some more heat over it to keep him sweating} 15. Rae1 {again white shows he worries about the e5 pawn's fate} b5 {the position is stable so now I'll play my Scheveningen thematic break pushing b5 to seek some counterplay on the queen's wing, and to free b7 for the bishop} 16. Qe2 Bh4 {to open both diagonals in front of white's king, g3 is in order, as white showed in previous moves he didn't want to lose the e5 pawn, so he would not move the rook away from e1} 17. g3 Be7 {back to the starting point, were he can do more damage} 18. Ne4 {? loses a pawn, as it blocks the e column and allows black to exchange a night for white's light squares bishop, white might have miscalculated Nf6+ wining a piece for the e5 pawn, but then I have Bxf6, defending the piece that captures e5} Ncxe5 19. Bxe5 Nxe5 20. Nf6+ {?! the point of Ne4, but is countered by Bxf6, giving back the dark squares bishop to get white's light squares bishop soon after the expected Rxf6 with Nxd3} Bxf6 {Rxf6 forced, after which I'll play Nxd3, with both diagonals open on white's king I'm headed for at least a draw, and with chances to fight for a win without many worries about losing...} 21. Rxf6 Nxd3 {In advantage exchange pieces is the motto} 22. Qxd3 Bb7 {occupies the long diagonal, and creates several threats on white's very exposed king} 23. Nd4 Qc5 {pins the knight with the idea of playing e5} 24. Qe3 Qd5 {now threatens mate but is also aimed at a2} 25. Nf3 Qxa2 26. Qh6 {the idea must be to try forcing a draw, or even play Ng5 to go for a win, so the knight must go} Bxf3 {again when in advantage forcing exchanges is my best policy  } 27. Rxf3 Qxb2 {one other pawn and the queen will play Qg7 to consolidate the position, then it's a question of pushing my pawns} 28. Rf4 Qg7 {if white wants to exchange it will turn my task a bit easy} 29. Qg5 Qc3 {keeping the queen on the a1-h8 diagonal, but forcing some positional disadvantages on white's camp, Re2 is almost forced in view of losing another pawn} 30. Re5 h6 {White is forced to play Qf6, and the e5 rook is pinned if white doesn't want to exchange, so I'll play Rad8 to force an exchange, or an attack on white's king} 31. Qf6 {forced} Rad8 {with the idea Rd1+} 32. Rxe6 {? loses a rook or the game} Rd1+ {now white has three reasonable choices (any of them loses material or exposes the king to an intensive attack):  a) Rf1 to block the check Rxf1+ Qxf1 fxe6 losing the mentioned rook in the process b) Kf2 to evade the check Qxc2+ Re2 Qc5+ Kg2 Rg1+ Kh3 Qh5+ Rh4 (Qh4) to block the check Qxe2 wins the rook for black c) Kg2 to evade the check Rd2+ Kh3 Qxc2 to play next Rxh2+ Kg4 forced Qd1+ Rf3 forced and remains pinned by the queen, Ra2 to play Ra4+ next} 33. Kg2 Rd2+ 34. Kh3 Qxc2 35. Re7 {!? expected, to play Rxf7, but is countered by my pin after the next sequence Rxh2+ Kg4 Qd1+ Rxf7 Ra4+ Qf4 only move as Kh3 is mated by Qh1++, but then the queen is also pined so black has Rxf7!!} Rxh2+ 36. Kg4 Qd1+ 37. Rf3 Ra2 {to play Ra4+, so I expect Re4, as if white persists with Rxf7 then Ra4+ Qf4 (Kh3 Qh1 is mate) Rxf7 and both the remaining rook and queen are pinned } 38. Re4 Qd7+ {now if Kh4 Rh2++ and Kf4 g5+ Ke3 (Ke5 Re8+ Qe6 Qxe6+ and white is lost) Qd2++  } 39. Kf4 g5+ 40. Ke3 Qd2# {}
