[Opening "Sicilian defence (B32)"]

1. e4 c5 {My opponent plays the Sicilian Defense. This usually leads to an exciting game.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 d5 {Already the action heats up.} 4. e5 {I choose to seize central space rather than exchange.} Bg4 {Pinning the protecting Knight.} 5. dxc5 {Now I have no choice.} Bxf3 6. Qxf3 {I didn't want to double my KB-pawns with PxB.} Nxe5 7. Qg3 Nc6 {Now that the opening flurry is over, both sides need to develop their pieces.} 8. Bb5 e6 9. O-O {My K-side is developed. Now for the Q-side.} Nge7 10. Bg5 Qa5 {Threatening my KB. I counter with...} 11. a4 {...this, seizing Q-side space as well as guarding the B.} a6 {Now I MUST move the B. I choose not to exchange.} 12. Bd2 Qd8 13. Bd3 {If Black castles K-side, my Bishops are now in position to support an attack.} Ng6 14. b4 Be7 {Black is preparing to do just that. Now I need to activate my QN an connect my Rooks.} 15. Na3 O-O 16. c4 {I am hoping my opponent will play PxP, undoubling my QB pawns.} d4 {He does not oblige.} 17. Nc2 {That Black Q-pawn looks like a nice target...} e5 {...so he gives it extra protection.} 18. b5 {If Black captures, I can undouble my Pawns.} axb5 19. cxb5 {he does and I do. Now the Black Knight will be chased from its post.} Nb8 20. f4 {Attack the base of the Pawn chain and it will crumble...} exf4 {Black could have played P-KB3, which would have been better for two reasons. First, it would have kept the K-side more closed. Second, it would supply a flight square for the King.} 21. Bxf4 Nxf4 22. Rxf4 {Now my Rook, Queen and Bishop are ail aimed at the vulnerable K-side, and the defending Knight has vanished.} Bxc5 23. Qg4 {Aiming at the QP, for now.} Nd7 24. Nxd4 Nf6 {Black races his other Knight to the defense.} 25. Qh4 {Now the Knight is the only piece preventing QxRP mate. 25... P-R3 or 25... R-K1 would neutralize this possibility.} Qb6 {He doesn't see the threat.} 26. Rxf6 {Remove the Knight... and the King falls. 26...P-R3, 26...P-N3 or 26...R-K1 stop the immediate mate, but then I can play 27 RxQ. Black resigns.}
