1. e4 {My standard. (I used to experiment but got unfavorable results)} e5 2. Nf3 f6 {An ugly little move that if often disastrous} 3. Nxe5 {A knight sacrifice...} fxe5 {?? Taking the Knight is probably one of the worst moves here.} 4. Qh5+ {Obvious} g6 {Probably the best although it allows a fork} 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8 Nf6 7. d3 {Preparing Bc1-h6 exploiting the pin on the black DSB} d6 8. Bh6 Nbd7 {Adds protection to the DSB} 9. Nc3 {Developing} Ne5 10. Nd5 {Chases the queen} Qe6 {?? This is a very bad move as it hangs a bishop and seriously displaced the Black king. Realizing this black resigned. I probably would have played on}
