1. e4 e5 {Oh boy! King's pawn! My favorite opening! ......................................................................................... ruachessnut2: Do not comment. This game is in progress! ......................................................................................... Are you a mod or something? Because if not...I don't care.} 2. Qh5 Nh6 {Oh right...yer one of these guys. Make a note of this. Whenever you are forced with this brutish opening, always bring yer queen to e7. I did not, and look what happened! ......................................................................................... dmaestro wrote:   Qh5?! followed by Nh6?...when simply Nc6 leave Black with an excellent game. 2...Qe7 is ok, but doesn't really do much to explain why white's second move isn't taken seriously.  .........................................................................................  Thanks  for the suggestion  I will use Nc6 in the future I like that. The reason this move cannot be taken seriously is that he brought queen out early, and he lost it. There is a reason masters are masters, and a reason why they choose not to immediately pull out the bazooka, and start blasting before a single pawn has been dropped.} 3. Qxe5+ Qe7 {I'm flucked.} 4. Qxc7 Nc6 {This hurt. I did not see this one  coming. This opening is not supposed to get me anymore.} 5. Qg3 Qxe4+ {But now he's the one who screwed up. Should have  protected the pawn. Now I get to copy the thing that he did to me, and send it back at him.} 6. Be2 Qxc2 {How do you like it, when it happens to you!?} 7. Na3 Qc5 {He doesn't like it, so I back off a little.} 8. Nh3 Nf5 {When you bring your queen out early, she gets chased. That is all there is to it.} 9. Qb3 Nfd4 {More chase.} 10. Qe3+ Be7 {Look at that beautiful queen/rook/king fork waiting to happen. Stupid knight on a3! Go away! Since he is  not going away...I may as well castle.} 11. Nb5 Nc2+ {And the sucker moves his stupid knight  on a3! Now his queen is  forked and  the game is over. This is WHY you DON'T bring YOUR LADY out EARLY.} 12. Kf1 Nxe3+ {I take his queen, and all the life trickles out of him. I think he will drag this game out as long as possible...which is fine by me. I like winning. ... I sure hope he didn't hang himself... ......................................................................................... gmflash2008: This was stupid. ......................................................................................... Like I said before, you just need to learn more chess notation for this to make sense to you. Please don't call it stupid just because you can't understand it. } 13. dxe3 Qb6 14. a4 a6 15.
