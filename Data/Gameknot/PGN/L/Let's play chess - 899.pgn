1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Bc4 h6 {Prevents Ng5 and also restricts future movement of my black bishop along that diagonal.} 5. b3 {Hence, I prepare to fiancetto the bishop instead. I had to be careful not to over-extend my white bishop here.} Nf6 6. O-O Bg4 {This pin was somewhat problematic. Nd4 could put a lot of pressure on the pinned knight. } 7. Bb5 {So I proceeded to pin his knight. I hadn't intended for this to happen as I really wanted that white bishop controlling the diagonal on his king-side from d3 eventually. However, given my position, I was now prepared to trade the bishop for the knight and get him a doubled-pawn structure on the queen-side.} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Qd7 {Looked like he wanted to castle. Nd4 seemed dangerous, but not yet (and even after O-O-O). I was going to fiancetto, shore up my positions with my rook before withdrawing the bishop to a safer location (or exchange for the knight if forced to do so).} 9. Bb2 Nd4 {Critical blunder. My queen was safe.} 10. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {He could still fight, since my position was cramped. My plan was to get the queen to safety while defending the c pawn, eventually freeing pieces for an attack through Nd5. At this point, the overall plan was to force as many piece exchanges as possible without jeopardizing the queen.} 11. Qd1 {}
