1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.} 3. d3 {Personally, I don't think White can safely decline this gambit, especially with such a passive move. That said, I see this all the time. More widely accepted are 3.Nxe5, 3.Bc4 and 3.exf5.} Nc6 {Essentially a waiting move. Black develops and waits for White to commit to an attack... or not.} 4. Nc3 Bb4 {White is playing passively, so Black goes immediately on the offensive.} 5. Bd2 Nf6 6. Qe2 {Preparing to castle long. White should be looking for a way to develop his KB soon, probably to g2 or maybe h3 at this point.} d6 7. O-O-O Qe7 {Black is also looking to castle queenside, to make use of his kingside spatial advantage.} 8. a3 Bc5 {Black would have nothing to gain by trading off this Bishop on c3 right now.} 9. Bg5 Be6 10. Nd5 {This is an interesting idea, but I still think White should be dealing with his woefully undeveloped kingside.} Qf7 11. Bxf6 {? This gives up the bishop-pair, opens the g-file for Black's Rook, and gives Black doubled f-pawns that are more of a strength than a weakness. I don't see any justification for this move--g2-g3 followed by Bh3 is stronger, I think.} gxf6 12. c4 {Black was technically threatening to win a pawn on d5, but I think retreating the Knight or even giving up the pawn to clear some space would have been better.} O-O-O 13. Qc2 {? I don't know what this is intended to accomplish. Perhaps White is trying to play Be2 and make some action on the kingside? Even if so, I think he would be better served by playing h3 and g4. His position is hopelessly disjointed right now.} Nd4 {Trading off White's kingside protection and opening c6 for a pawn kick.} 14. Nxd4 Bxd4 15. Kb1 {The center is in danger of being blasted wide open, and getting the King off the c-file is good--but putting him on a diagonal with his Queen isn't much better, and White should have other priorities right now!} c6 16. Ne3 {This blocks the Bishop's attack on f2, but I was expecting Nc3 at the time--on e3, it will be easily-harassed. White wants to defend his kingside, but on e3, he will be hard-pressed to defend his actual King!} fxe4 17. Be2 {? Of all the times to move the Bishop...} exd3 18. Qxd3 f5 {White didn't deal with it early when he had the chance, and now Black's pawn center is formidable.} 19. Rhf1 {White is preoccupied with defending his kingside pawns, and they are certainly weak--but Black, for the moment, is not aimed that way.} f4 {After 20.Nc2 Bf5 21.Qd2 Rhg8 White's position is looking fragile indeed.} 20. Ng4 {?? White overlooks the royal pin, and will lose in short order.} Bf5 21. Qxf5+ Qxf5+ 22. Ka2 d5 23. cxd5 Rxd5 24. Bc4 Ra5 {? Here I overlooked the direct route with 24...Qc2 and mate to follow.} 25. f3 Qc2 26. Be6+ Kc7 27. Nxe5 {?? Not that it matters, but White could have dragged it on a bit longer with 27.Rb1 or 27.Rxd4.} Qxb2# {Many thanks to bertinator for the game! Declining the Latvian Gambit can have brutal consequences without some very active play--White's forces were scattered and ineffective throughout the game.  Comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated. If you leave a rating, please also comment to let me know what I did well or how I can improve. Thanks for reading!}
