[Opening "English opening (A21)"]

1. c4 {My usual opening - English, if i'm not mistaken. The idea is still the same as English - controlling the d5 square and focusing on claiming the white squares early.} e5 {A usual retort. Controlling the black squares in the middle, usually followd by either 2.. Nc6 or 2.. Bc5} 2. Nc3 {Still focusing on the white squares. The reason why i love this opening is because its not directly confrontational, but sort of pre-emptive} Bc5 {Black took the 2.. Bc5 approach. Looks like the start of trying to control the centre. Restricts my usual 3.d4 move.} 3. e3 {Backing up for 4.d4 and at the same time supporting the lone pawn on c4 with my white bishop. However, this is a very slow move as it doesn't really develop my position and ultimately restricts the movement of my Black bishop} Nf6 {Black has developed quite well here. He's now ready to castle early, and now has control over the d4 square and challenging control over e4 and d5 squares.} 4. d4 {This move has a few purposes. Firstly, i am now trying to gain control over the e5 square by attacking it and then later on bring forth my knight on f3. Also, i'm now allowing some breathing space for my black bishop if 4.. exd4 5exd4 Bg5} exd4 5. exd4 Qe7+ {Can't protect with the queen cos pawn on d4 is under threat.} 6. Be3 {There's a reason why i picked this move. Right now, the centre is totally controlled by my pieces. d5 and e5 has two pieces controlling it and now i have mobility to a few of my key pieces. And now d4 is not really under too much threat as it has been eliviated by the bishop} Bb6 {I'm not sure if this was a good move, but now i plan on trying to trap the bishop} 7. Rb1 {Trying for b4} Nc6 {d4 is now under threat. I need to protect my king as Be3 is the active pin on my king} 8. Be2 Nxd4 9. Bxd4 O-O {At this point, i like to analyse the position of the board once a party has castled. I usually castle when i've got close to 100% mobility of my pieces. Right now, i have a bishop at optimal point (although c5 would ruin it). My bishops are active and out. And all i need to do is mobilise my knight to Nf3} 10. Nf3 c5 {As expected. But at the end of the day, i have good control over the central squares. I opt for a trade} 11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. O-O Qg6 {12.. Qg6. This is very slow play as black is planning on 13. ..d6 14. .. Bg3, trying to pin the pawn on g2 to my king. But it is an easily preventable attack, with g3 stopping it effectively. So i proceed with attacking the king side.} 13. Nd5 d6 {This was the move that changed the game. i guess it was a silly mistake, but i had to capitalise. This also gave me an opportunity to get Black to weaken his king side defence, introduce a double pawn, ensure that the gap in his king side is a white square (cos i've only got a white bishop) and take his queen.} 14. Ne7+ Kh8 15. Nxg6+ fxg6 16. Qxd6 {It was wishful thinking =D But i knew that he was going to move his white bishop, so i plan on trying to work on his double pawn disadvantage} Bf5 17. Rbd1 {I was soooo hoping that black would play 17.. Rd8. Wishful thinking, yet again...} h5 {I guess this was an ok move, as not to trap his king. But at this point i saw that i was in the most optimal place to finally attack his double pawn (pawn on g6). i needed to try and get rid of the bishop on f5} 18. Nh4 Bc2 19. Bd3 {Ok, now his bishop is out of the way.} Rfd8 {Knew that this was coming. Time to attack the g6 pawn} 20. Nxg6+ Kg8 21. Qe6+ Kh7 {I had a few options here. Do the obvious discovered check with the white bishop, but losing it to the bishop on c2. I decided to take the long way and remove the threat on my bishop on d3} 22. Bxc2 Rde8 {On reflection, i could've just sacrificed my queen and developed my Rf1 to e1. That way, when he does take my queen with Re6, i could move my knight to f8, have the discovered check and be up in material by a rook and a knight. But i didnt, because of the next few moves} 23. Ne7+ Kh8 24. Qf5 {It was a silly thought - "i wonder if he will take my knight...?"...} Rxe7 {He did!} 25. Qh7# {Ok, its a bit of an anti-climax in the end. But the thing I learnt was the real weakness of double pawns and how important it is to control and protect the central squares. I'm still a noob, but this was a game i quite enjoyed. The opponent was good but he made 2 major errors. Well, that's all folks!}
