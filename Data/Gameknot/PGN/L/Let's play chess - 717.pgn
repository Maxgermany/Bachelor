1. e4 {Another long game, won in the endgame. As Black, I just tried to hold off my opponent and counter-punch effectively.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {This weakens White's future development, as the Queen Knight is deprived of its best square.} Nf6 4. h3 {??? This move has no discernable purpose.} Bc5 5. Bb5 O-O 6. Bxc6 bxc6 7. d3 {Now I'll have a central Pawn wedge...} Ba6 8. g4 g6 9. Nxe5 {Oops! I flat-out blundered away a Pawn.} d5 10. Nxc6 Qd6 11. Nd4 dxe4 12. dxe4 Nxe4 {Well, I'm still behind a Pawn, but at least I've centralized my Knight.} 13. Qf3 Rfe8 14. Kd1 Bxd4 15. cxd4 {I have a couple of advantages... White can't castle and his Queen-side is undeveloped... I have to get the material back before White consolidates.} Nf6 16. Qc3 Rad8 17. Be3 Nd5 18. Qd2 Nxe3+ 19. fxe3 {I've gained a minor exchange...} Qg3 20. Nc3 Qxe3 {Material is even again. If White exchanges, I can get at least a draw in the ensuing endgame.} 21. Qxe3 Rxe3 22. Kc2 Rxd4 {Now I'm UP a pawn and a minor exchange. I sense I have some winning possibilities.} 23. Rae1 Rxe1 24. Rxe1 {Every exchange now helps me...} Bd3+ 25. Kc1 Rd7 26. Re8+ Kg7 27. Re3 h5 {I'm going to try and convert my King-side majority into a passed Pawn.} 28. gxh5 gxh5 {Mission accomplished...} 29. Kd2 Bg6+ 30. Kc1 f5 {Now I'm feeling good. I just have to get the f-pawn moving...} 31. Rg3 Kh6 {Can't let myself stay pinned.} 32. Ne2 Rf7 33. Nf4 Rf6 34. Nxg6 Rxg6 {If Black is foolish enough to exchange Rooks, the King ending remaining is an easy win.} 35. Rc3 c6 36. b4 Rf6 {Endgame maxim: Rooks belong behind passed Pawns.} 37. a4 Kg5 38. Rg3+ Kh4 {Now with the attacked h-pawn, I can restrict the mobility of White's Rook.} 39. Rb3 f4 40. Kd2 f3 {The h-pawn will now fall.} 41. Ke1 Kxh3 42. Kf2 Kg4 {With two passed King-side Pawns, the ending is now a technical win. I just have to not screw it up.} 43. Rc3 h4 44. b5 cxb5 {Anything that simplifies the Queen-side makes my task on the King-side easier.} 45. axb5 Rf7 46. Rc4+ Rf4 {Again offering the exchange of Rooks, which would win me the game immediately.} 47. Rc7 Ra4 48. Rg7+ Kf4 49. Rh7 {White's only hope is to lock up the King-side so that I can't make progress, or get a perpetual check.} Ra2+ 50. Kf1 {With White's King driven back, I can advance still further.} Kg3 51. Rg7+ Kh3 52. Re7 Kg3 53. Rg7+ Kh2 {No perpetual check or threefold repetition...} 54. Rh7 h3 {... and White resigns. There's no way to prevent a Black Pawn from Queening.}
