1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. a3 {Unnecessary. If Black plays ...Bb4, you can play Qc2 and you have no problems.} c5 4. g3 b6 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. d3 Bb7 7. Nf3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. e4 {Putting all your centre pawns on white squares means that you have less control over the black squares.} Ng4 10. Ng5 {I think the best option here was to play the simple 10.h3.} Nge5 {It appears that Black is now threatening to win a piece.} 11. Bf4 {White finds an ingenious solution!} h6 {If Black plays 11...Bxg5 White has 12.Bxe5 Nxe5 13.f4, winning the piece back.} 12. Nf3 Nxf3+ 13. Bxf3 Nd4 {The black square weakness that I mentioned earlier now manifests itself.} 14. Be3 Nxf3+ 15. Qxf3 d6 16. Qg4 Bg5 17. Bxg5 {I think I would have preferred 17.f4 here.} Qxg5 18. Nb5 Qxg4 {}
