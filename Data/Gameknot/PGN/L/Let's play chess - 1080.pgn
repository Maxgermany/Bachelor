[Opening "English opening (A21)"]

1. c4 {This is actually a very interesting game, right up until the last move.  The English Opening.  One of my personal favorites.} e5 {The natural response, taking control of the center in response to the flank attack} 2. Nc3 b6 {The fianchetto often occurs in the English from both players, though not usually this early.} 3. d3 {Preparing the e4 push to limit the mobility of the light-squared bishop.} Bb7 4. e4 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4 {I have never been fond of this move.  The c3 knight isn't protecting anything, it isn't exerting a particularly large influence over the center, and black is willing to sacrifice his bishop pair?  Also, it allows white to develop his bishop to a good square that puts lots pressure on the center.} 6. Bd2 Nf6 7. g3 Qe7 {Preparing 0-0-0, which I think leads to very interesting games after 0-0 by white.  } 8. Bg2 Bxc3 {Now black trades the pieces?} 9. Bxc3 d6 10. O-O O-O-O {And here, things get interesting.} 11. b4 {The pawn flank attacking the king is often a good tactic when in a cross-castling situation.  It means that often, the winner is the one who gets there first.} Nb8 {Preparing to defend the potentially weak d7 square, or at least be ready to redeploy his knight where it can't be attacked directly.} 12. Qa4 {A signal that white is selling out everything for this attack.} Qd7 {This move opens up some very enticing options with the bishop being able to attack the queen pinned to the King on the h3-c8 diagonal, though it requires protecting the h3 square first.} 13. Qxa7 Na6 {Trying to trap the Queen} 14. b5 Qe6 {A very good move, sacrificing the Knight in order to severely limit the usefulness of my Queen.} 15. bxa6 {I accept anyway.} Bc6 16. Ng5 {Finally trying to protect the h3 square and skewer the Queen, but I waited to long, because Black sees it coming.} Qe7 17. Bh3+ {I check anyway because it will win me a rook in exchange for the bishop. (Black can't block with the Bishop because Qa8#)} Rd7 18. Rab1 {Setting up the rook sacrifice on b6 in order to free my Queen back up.  I have enough material in hand to be able to afford this sac, even if it doesn't gain me a whole lot in terms of position.} Kd8 {????? I suppose he was trying to break the pin on the rook, but of course, this allows...} 19. Qb8# {checkmate.  I told you that this game was good until the last move... Comments are read and appreciated, or you can PM me at jamesxc. Thanks for reading.}
