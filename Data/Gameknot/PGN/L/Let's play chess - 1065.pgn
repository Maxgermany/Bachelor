[Opening "Four knights (C48), Spanish variation"]

1. e4 {King pawn opening - typically the start of a tactical game.} e5 {Double king pawn opening, which can lead to the Ruy Lopez, Kings Gambit, Petrov, Bishops Opening.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Looking like a Ruy Lopez.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {Four Knights, Spanish Classical Defense.} 4. Bb5 {Last book move.} Bd6 {Bb4, Bc5, d6, Nd4, d4 are a few typical book choices here. The text move has the disadvantage of blocking the d pawn, but has the advantage of enabling castling.} 5. Bc4 {White positions the bishop better to target f7, which will enable a pin after 0-0-0 by black. White can afford some non developing moves because black is positionally bad due to the bishop and knight blocking the c and d pawns which close in the c8 bishop and limit the queen.} Bc5 {Black finds a better position for the bishop. The position is equal.} 6. d3 {Opening a bishop line c1-h6, while closing f1-d3 for the other bishop. The goal appears to keep both bishops good, and developing a bishop outside the pawn chain is a plus.} d6 {Black seeks a similiar and symetrical strategy.} 7. h3 {The text move weakens the pawn structure if castling short, but prevents a pin by Bc8-g4, or Nf6-g4. Future moves will determine the effectiveness of this move.} Be6 {A trade of B x B will result in doubled pawns for black. Perhaps black is willing to sacrifice the pawn structure to gain 0-0-0. Another idea may be to castle short after the exchange which will give the rook the half open f file which can be used to attack by exchange sacrifice later at f3.} 8. Bxe6 fxe6 9. Bg5 {Applying a pin which is hard to refute without creating additional weakness on the kingside.} O-O {Black takes a lead in development.} 10. Bxf6 {This move should be criticized because it offers nothing for the exchange. White just hands over the bishop advantage to black.} Qxf6 {Stronger perhaps was Rf8xf6 with the idea of Qd8-f8 for better use of the f file. The queen gains no real advantage from this position because of a lack of good use of diagonals.} 11. Nb5 {White targets a weak point at c7.} Bb6 {Black covers the weakness while maintaining the useful bishop line.} 12. a4 {Probably with the idea of a4-a5 to dislodge the bishop, which would be bad for white because black owns a5 via N + B vs R for white. Better would be to develop with the intent of castling long, then using all resources for a kingside attack, which should have good chances considering the weak kingside pawns for black.} a6 {Black drives the knight back, which removes the pressure on c7, but helps the knight to centralize more, gaining central control.} 13. Nc3 Nd4 {A nice move!  Nd4! with the idea of Nf3xd4, Qf6xf2# Of course it never works out as planned, so white will respond with a better move.} 14. Rf1 {White sacrifices 0-0 with the idea of preventing the attack against the king.} Nxf3+ {A difficult choice. The text move removes a strong defender, but offers an exchange of queens, and loses the strength of the posted knight - which may have been inevidable. But what else is there? Maybe Rf8-f7 with Ra8-f8 to create a stronger attack?} 15. gxf3 {Qd1xf3 appears better because now Qf6-h4! and black threatens mate or Qh4xh3. The kingside is weak for white.} Qxf3 {Gaining a point, offering an exchange of queens, but Qf6-h4 looks better because more leverage can be had with the queen on the board. It is true that after Qd1xf3, Rf8xf3 both the f2 and h3 pawns are attacked and both can not be saved, so the same +1 is gained, but again no queens after.} 16. Qxf3 Rxf3 17. O-O-O Bxf2 {This move immediately gains a pawn, but has the disadvantage of enabling a pin on the bishop. Of course Ra8-f8 will remedy the situation, but then Rd1-d2 will prevent Rf3xh3.} 18. Rd2 Raf8 19. Nd1 {Now the bishop must move, and there is no advantage over 17.Rxh3.} Be3 {This move results in equal trades resulting in black maintaining the 2 point lead. With accurate play black should win.} 20. Nxe3 Rf3xf1+ 21. Nxf1 Rxf1+ 22. Rd1 Rxd1+ 23. Kxd1 {Both kings will have to race towards the kingside of the board. White to protect the h3 pawn, and black to try and press the advantage using the pawn majority. A plan for black would be to distract the king using operations on the queenside, then sieze the advantage on the queenside.} g5 24. Ke2 Kg7 25. Kf3 h5 26. Kg3 d5 27. b4 dxe4 28. dxe4 Kf7 29. c4 b6 30. h4 g4 31. Kf2 Ke7 32. Kg3 {This move is bad because it is obvious that both kings can not pass on the f file, so the action will take place queenside where both kings should be.} Kd6 33. Kf2 a5 34. bxa5 bxa5 35. Ke3 Kc5 {Good move, traditional !  White can not both protect the c pawn and block the g pawn.} 36. Kd3 {White can only stop the g pawn at the expense of the c pawn.} g3 37. Ke2 Kxc4 38. Kf3 Kd3 {Black has the advantage on this move by blockading the white king and enabling a free path for the c pawn.} 39. Kxg3 c5 40. Kf3 c4 41. Kf2 Kd2 {Keeping the opposition. Note how the black king controls c1, c2, c3, which gives the pawn complete safety on these squares. The white king can not pass and can not achieve a passed pawn in time.} 42. Kf1 c3 43. Kf2 c2 {Resignation to the inevidable. Good game! Looks like someone was reading that Silman endgame book! Nice endgame play!}
