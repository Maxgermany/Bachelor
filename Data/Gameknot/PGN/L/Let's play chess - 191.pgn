1. e4 {Controlling the center} a5 {Countering on the flank} 2. Nf3 {questionable, white should try to gain territory elsewhere instead of in the same area, balance is good} h5 {controlling both flanks now} 3. Bc4 {i do not understand} Nh6 {developing knight} 4. h3 {i do not understand} Na6 {developing other knight} 5. a3 {maybe to get bishop safe later?} c6 {i plan to attack the strangely placed bishop} 6. Nc3 {developing knight} b5 {attack} 7. Nxb5 {why} cxb5 {so just a free knight} 8. Ba2 {i don't get it} Bb7 {developing bishop and attacking pawn} 9. Ne5 {ideas of checkmate} Bxe4 {he did not defend it} 10. d3 Bxg2 {i take another pawn} 11. Rg1 {i was afraid he would play Bxh6, in which case i probably would have resigned} d6 {i want him out} 12. Nxf7 Nxf7 {safe} 13. Rxg2 {i have two knights for the bishop, but i should be careful because he has 5 long vs 4 long} e6 {developing bishop and queen} 14. Bd2 Nc7 {guarding the pawn} 15. Qe2 {attacking the pawn} Qf6 {guarding the pawn and attacking a pawn} 16. O-O-O {guarding the pawn} b4 {going for the attack} 17. b3 {he makes a weird move} Qa1+ 18. Bb1 Qxa3# {ok}
