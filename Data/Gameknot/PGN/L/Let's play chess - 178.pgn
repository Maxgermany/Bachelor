1. d4 {this is my first game ever with a player rating >1800. i was defeated, ofcourse. i learn few things in this game. i thought it is good to share. if you are expert player please comment on my worst moves. so i can learn too.  queen pawn opening, i was playing black. i chose to go for benoni opening.} Nf6 {indian defense opening} 2. c4 {just developing...} c5 {indian defense ...} 3. d5 e6 {contd with indian defense} 4. Nc3 exd5 {contd with indian defense opening....} 5. cxd5 d6 { indian defense benoni variation....} 6. e4 g6 7. Nf3 {indian defense/ benoni defense/ classical variation...} Bg7 8. Bd3 {benoni classical variation....} O-O {all study material advises early castling....so i did that too...} 9. O-O {he also castled....} Re8 {seizing half open file by rook....if you notice my position. my weakness is d6 pawn. my light bishop at c8 and knight at b8 have no good place to be positioned. i was struggling in this game to develop my light bishop and knight. i think, this is a significant problem with benoni defense. experts advise me on how to develop these pieces on the way, pls...} 10. Bf4 {he swiftly attacked my weakness at pawn d6. battle started already.... my queen is defending it. i personally consider that defending with queen as a weakness. i didnt read it anywhere but that is my personal opinion.} a6 {i guessed his next move to be Nb4 to attack my weakness d6 with his second piece, then it is hard for me to defend. so i moved a6 to defend b4 square. computer suggests same move. i do computer analysis only after game. if do while playing it is cheating, i never do that. i never learn anything that way...} 11. h3 {he defended g4 blocking my bishop pinning his knight. } b5 {i moved b5 with a small plan. i want to move my knight at b8 to c4 . that was my plan.  right now, knight has no good square to go. i was focusing on developing...} 12. Re1 {he placed his rook to a good position. not a harm now. but it is indirectly challenging my rook. later in game he took advantage of it. a good move in my opinion.} Nh5 {i moved my knight with the aim to exchange my knight for his bishop. so my weakness at d6 is safe. } 13. Bh2 {he refused my exchange offer..... wise player....} Qc7 {i want knight to move d7, so i moved my queen to c7 so it can continue to defend my weakness d6. } 14. Rc1 {a brillant move in my opinion. when i was playing i didnt notice it. later when i analysed the game i understood his idea. he is making a potential pin. my queen and his rook is on same file. i completely ignored his move when i was playing. i dont have much experience in chess. it is a brillant move, making potential pin. later in the game he could take advantage of it. so it is important to place your piece at strategical position so later in the game you could take advantage. you may not see immediate benefit in such moves.} Nd7 {i moved my knight, focusing on development. i developed my knight before bishop. many study material advise to develop knight before bishop, i still dont know why. i just follow as if i am a robot.} 15. a3 {he thought i am going to attack his knight by b4, so he defended it. but that was not my plan at all. my plan was knight to c5. } c4 {so i executed my plan. just moved my pawn clearing c5 for my knight. } 16. Be2 {i didnt expect this move at all. i thought he would defend his weakness e4. there was 3 defenders for that pawn at e4. now only one defender. so that pawn became my target.} Nc5 {so i placed my knight c5. happy now. i found that it is attacking his weakness as well. i was not planning to attack earlier. i only thought for a good square for my knight. but i am getting an opportunity to attack as well. } 17. Nd2 {he saw that as well. he moved his knight to defend his weakness. (that was my guess). i think that is only reason for this move.  think of this position now. i should have studied this when i was playing.  my pawn d6 is pinned by his bishop and it is defending my knight. it is not good for me.   my dark bishop at g7 could capture his knight at c3. i didnt see that. i could have removed one of his defender(defending his weakness pawn at e4) by capturing his knight with my bishop. i missed that opportunity. i didnt see that while playing.  so studying the position is so important. i will do it hereafter.} Nf6 {so retreated my knight to attack his weakness e4. now, 3 vs 2. my 3 attackers and his 2 defenders.} 18. b3 Ncxe4 {i went for capturing his weakness. my calculation was simple. 3 attackers vs 2 defenders. i am winning in this small battle.  later when i analysed the game, i felt that i should have gone for this battle. i have not developed my light bishop and i have not connected my rooks. because of this i suffered. even though my calculation was right. it was not wise to go for battle when pieces are not developed. a good lesson i learned. you watch the game you will see for yourself. how i suffered because of that...} 19. Ndxe4 {he captured my knight...} Nxe4 {i captured his knight...} 20. Bxc4 {a totally unexpected move. i guess this kind of move you can experience only with high rated players. all of sudden, table turned over. i am in small trouble now because my rooks are not connected. i could have moved away my knight to safety anytime if it was connected.  in this position, my knight is attacked by his 2 pieces and i have only defender. so my knight is gone. so my only option was to capture his light bishop. so my pieces would be even with him.   when i analysed in computer it suggets to capture his knight with by dark bishop. so that means it could have removed one of his attacker. but i didnt see that brillant move. when he made a totally unexpected move and i realised that i am in small trouble. it was not big trouble. i should have taken time to see possible variant moves. never come to a quick conclusion. when i saw i could capture his bishop i was satisified with that move and continued with that plan. always look for the best move. i learned that lesson. } bxc4 {so i just captured his bishop.} 21. Nxe4 {he captured my knight.  see in this position, pawn at c4 is pinned. i cant save it by any means.  also, a knight in my border. red alert. what could be his next move. i saw a good move from his side. he could capture my weak pawn at d6 by his knight, attacking my rook as well. i cant allow that to happen. so i thought for a while. i found a move. } Be5 {i moved my bishop to defend my weakness. } 22. Bxe5 {he went for trading bishop. now, my question is to myself that, should i capture his bishop with my rook or my pawn. i thought for a while. if i capture with my pawn it would create a dangerous passed pawn for him at d5. i may suffer a lot with a passed pawn. i dont want myself in big trouble with his passed pawn. } Rxe5 {so i caputerd his bishop with my rook. } 23. Rxc4 {a good move. attacking my defender, my queen. } Qe7 {i moved my queen to e7, actually not a good move. i creating pin position again. my rook activity gets limited.   one good lesson, activity of the pieces should be your priority. because of this move i reduced the activity of my rook. i should not do this in future.} 24. f4 {alas!, he attacked my rook with his least army. how to defend this? i am in a big trouble.   see, my light square bishop is not developed all this while. and now i am going to lose my rook. i thought for a while. i found a escape route. } Qa7+ {i called a check. my rook is safe now. } 25. Kh2 {my next concern, where to place my rook?   i cant retreat my rook to e8. then his knight can call check by Nf6.  i cant move my rook to h5. then he would attack with his pawn by g4 then my rook would be trapped at h file. only square i found was e7. then he could capture my pawn at d6. but i didnt find any other alternative.} Re7 {so i moved my rook to safety.} 26. Nxd6 {he captured the benoni weakness d6. i may not play benoni again.} Rxe1 {i traded my rook, thought of simplification. many study material doesnt support that kind of move. i am 2 pawn behind then i should not trade. i forgot that. i was under pressure. his knight, rook in my border. so i thought of simplification.  if i could have defended my rook with my king instead of trade....i missed that..anyway...} 27. Qxe1 Bb7 {finally i developed my bishop. another benoni weakness in my opinion. but that was stupid move. my opponent swiftly exploited it.  computer was suggesting bishop sacriface by capturing the pawn at h3. i also thought of it. but i could not find good continuation of it, so i dropped that idea. } 28. Rc7 {a brillant move. i sensed defeat by this move. } Qd4 {i made this move after thinking a lot. a good move or not. i will tell you my idea.  my idea is to capture his pawn at f4 calling check same time attacking his knight or rook. if he captures my bishop with his knight. i can call check and win his rook. or if captures my bishop with his rook, i can call check and capture his knight.  that was my idea.  } 29. Nxb7 {he captured my bishop with his knight. i was happy in my mind. because my plan was to call check at f4 and then capture his rook. } Qxf4+ {i called a check.} 30. Qg3 {alas! he defended it...i felt sorry. i didnt see that variation. i didnt see his queen at all when i was calculating. i lost.} Qxg3+ {nothing much i could do i traded my queen. it is not good idea to trade when you are down in material....} 31. Kxg3 Ra7 {i thought of paralysing his rook. not a good idea. here, his rook has to defend his knight. but he can come out of it by calling check.} 32. d6 {he moved his passed pawn.see, diagonal drawn from his pawn would reach at f8 and my king is behind it. so i cant defend it with my king. that is it. game over. i cant defend that anymore....  still i dont know why i was defeated. any comments from expert. any brains to help me..... i developed my bishop was my serious blunder move. all else was not that bad move in my opinion. }
