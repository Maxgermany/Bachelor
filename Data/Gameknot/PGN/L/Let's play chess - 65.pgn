1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 {steering at the closed version, of the Sicilian...} 3. d4 {the best way to go: contest c5...} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {I understand this: but this move, does not belong in this system...} 6. Be3 {maybe a bit early: Ng4 can contest this Bishop...} e5 7. Nb3 {bold: Nf3 seems sounder...} Be7 8. f3 {cautious: although f4, was already an option...} Be6 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O {probably best...} Qc7 11. g4 {the White Kings' wing is on the move...} b5 12. g5 Nfd7 {weak: b4 might have been an option...} 13. Qf2 Nc6 14. Kb1 b4 {as was to be expected...} 15. Nd5 Bxd5 16. exd5 Ncb8 17. h4 {not mocking around...} Nc5 {why not a5?} 18. Bc4 {best Nxc5...} Nxb3 19. Bxb3 {everything under control...} Nd7 20. h5 a5 21. Ba4 Nc5 22. Bc6 {of course...} Rab8 23. g6 fxg6 {not good: this will open up Black Kings' wing...} 24. hxg6 hxg6 {asking for trouble...} 25. Rdg1 {right...} e4 {a blunder: Rf6 was life saving...} 26. f4 {no sweat: but Qh2 was much stronger here...} Bf6 27. Rxg6 {why not?} a4 {trying to pry open, the White Kings' defense: but White has an evil attack...} 28. Qh2 Kf7 {probably forced...} 29. Qg2 {Qh7 or a direct Rxf6+ was also an option: but this works fine...} b3 {useless: and avoiding the issue at hand...} 30. Rxf6+ {White has many ways, to win this...} Kxf6 {after gxf6, Rh7+, and devastation...} 31. Bd4+ {the beginning, of the end...} Ke7 32. Qxg7+ Rf7 33. Qg5+ {it is over...} Kf8 {only move...} 34. Rh8# {finishing it...}
