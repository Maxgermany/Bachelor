1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bd6 {Everything standard up to here. Blocks the d-pawn, and thus the black lsb, but not completely horrible. } 3. d4 {Opens up the center, especially trying to take advantage with the e5 pawn push due to the weakness of the bishop on d6. } exd4 4. Bc4 {e5 here helps Black by developing his bishop to the more active c5 square though.  More importantly Black cannot play Nf6 because of e5 Qe7 Qe2 losing a piece. Also Black cannot play Ne7 because Ng5 0-0 Qh5 loses material. } h6 {Stops the idea of Ng5, but is also very slow. } 5. O-O {White is in no hurry to take the pawn, Black cannot hold on to it. } c5 {? Positionally this move makes little sense because white can play c3 and win back the pawn if he wants to.   But more importantly Black is wasting development on pawn moves. } 6. c3 {Obviously the pawn cannot be taken due to Qxd6. } Qc7 {Protecting the bishop but leaves Black with other problems. } 7. Qb3 {! Oddly the f7 square cannot be defended because of the misplaced bishop on d6 and the misplaced pawn on h6. } Be5 {? Moving and already developed piece again. } 8. Bxf7+ Kf8 9. cxd4 {White wants to play Na3, but first I solidify my pawn structure and open the c-file. } cxd4 10. Na3 Nf6 {Does not see the simple threat. } 11. Nb5 Qd8 12. Nxe5 {White is completely winning here, but again Black ignores a simple threat. } Qe7 {??} 13. Ng6# {A pretty ending with a mate with bishop and knight. It really was a pretty mating pattern so enjoy!}
