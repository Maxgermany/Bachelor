1. d4 {A nice tactic sacrifice... the strenght of the London attack.} d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bf4 Nf6 4. h4 Bb4+ {A naive move or a plan? } 5. c3 {I plan to develop the b1 knight to d2 anyway. } Bd6 6. Ne5 Nbd7 7. e3 {Still safe. If black exchanges, I have time to defend e5 before black can threat it another time. } c5 {Good. Black "must" play this move sooner or later in this opening. } 8. Qf3 {The white pieces are already pointing to the black's kingside. } Qb6 9. b3 {Black can try some kind of sac here, like c4, 16. b4, Bxb4. White threats Nxf7, KxN, g4... another interesting tactic sac. I can't bet for any of the two sacs, deeper analysis would be necessary. } O-O {Getting into the enemy's play.} 10. Nd2 {I've done this one since black can attack with c4, threating c4xb3 (which is bad for me, and I cannot defend it easily) or Qb2, if I take the pawn. Now, by this move, I'm setting the "trick": Nd2-c4, and he cannot take it because Nxc4, trheatening the queen and the bishop at the same time, recovering my piece and a pawn, along with a good position.  Bd3 was ok, apparently, and if c4, Bc2. But after Ne4, I'm giving him an "attacking" position, I didn't like it.  Be2 sets the threat Qg3 (for Bh6), but it is easily met, and there are a lot of ways the game can go on.  I hoped the trick I am building is too deep for him to see. Anyway, not a bad move as it seems to be.} h6 11. Be2 {This is to avoid Nh4 after Qg3. } Nh7 12. Qg3 Bxe5 13. dxe5 {The anti natural key move of this opening. } Kh8 14. Nf3 {I am already seeing the knight sac on g5.} f6 15. Bd3 f5 {My bishop is blocked, but this allows me to play the sac (Ng5). Black's self blocked pieces are playing in my favour, so I have time for another preparatory move.} 16. Qg6 Qd8 17. Ng5 {I liked it. It is not a "perfect" sac, but it was too nice not to play it. } Nxg5 {The only one.} 18. hxg5 Qe8 {Black thinks all his problems will fade by exchanging queens, but it is not so easy. } 19. Rxh6+ {Second sac...} gxh6 20. Qxh6+ Kg8 21. O-O-O {This simple move is definitory. Black is tied to defend the h column, and this allows me to play freely and eventually recover the piece. } Qe7 {Or Qf7 (the only way to stop the Rh1 threat). } 22. Rh1 Qg7 23. Qxe6+ {At first, I thought about Bxf5 after the black's move. This is not enough to win. I was sweating, since if the sac doesn't bring me to a victory, I will be playing an idiot. } Qf7 24. Qh6 Qg7 {Same as before, but, now my e pawn is free...} 25. Qxg7+ Kxg7 26. e6 {Another simple move that makes the difference. Black cannot move the knight, because it is mate in few moves. He must have returned the piece, but still with a weak position.  c4 gives him a breath, but without avoiding the mate threat. If black lets me take the knight, his king would have had a square to escape... but he, apparently, didn't see it. } Nb6 27. Be5+ {And the forced mate sequence is set. } Kg6 28. Rh6+ {Kxg5, Bf4+, Kg4, Be2#.} Kxg5 29. Bf4+ {}
