[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian defense, i only have started to explore this opening} 2. Bc4 {nout used to seeing this but ok} e6 {wanted to stop the pressure of that bishop} 3. a3 {not developing move} Nc6 4. d3 Nf6 5. h3 {knights out, and i m starting to think that white is doing too many pawn moves} Be7 {developing bishop so i can castle and not give white and option to pin my knight} 6. Nf3 {finally a developing move from white} a6 {thinking about pushing the bishop away} 7. O-O h5 {he castles and i try to set up a fishing pole trap, tho it was a little far fetched} 8. Nh2 {stoping my plan} Qc7 9. f4 {advance in a center, i saw hes gonna slam the door on my queen and push my knight away, but i saw a good home for my knight} h4 {preparing the anchor for my knight} 10. e5 Nh5 {maneuvering my knigth} 11. Qg4 {queen is pressuring my g and h pawn} b5 {pushing his bishop, so i can develop my own} 12. Ba2 Bb7 13. Nf3 {putting more pressure on my h pawn and sectioning the queen} Ng3 {my knight gets in that juicy square, h pawn is defended, and taking the g pawn wouldtn be good} 14. Re1 {moving the rook from the knights reach} O-O-O {i castle queen side, its kinda scary cuz of my pawns on the queenside but i thought i can manage it} 15. c4 {white immediatly lashes out on my pawns} Rdg8 {this move wasnt really necessary, that rook is actually quite stupid there} 16. cxb5 axb5 {he takes away from the centre and i recapture} 17. Nc3 c4 {now if he takes my b pawn i get the knight} 18. dxc4 Bc5+ {i give check cuz i see that white is going to end up in a pin, if he blocks with a bishop} 19. Be3 Bxe3+ 20. Rxe3 Qb6 {now rook is in a pin} 21. Kf2 Ne7 {re-positioning the knight to add an attacker on the rook} 22. Nd2 {hes moving his knight, dunno exctaly why... } Nef5 {rook is ready to be taken} 23. Rae1 {now i can take the rook, but i see a better move} Nh1+ {check with my knight, if Kf1 or Kg1 i ll win both rooks or a rook and queen} 24. Ke2 Qxe3+ {taking the rook with check, if Kf1 its mate} 25. Kd1 Nf2+ {forking the queen and king tho my queen is also free to take} 26. Kc2 {if king went to c1 i can take the rook with check and win in the exchange, tho now i have a check with taking the queen } Qd3+ {and white resigns, i m winning his queen, up a lot of material }
