1. e4 {Our ratings were even at the start of this game. I enjoyed it} c5 {Not my usual play, but quite common obviously} 2. Bc4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Bb5+ Nd7 5. exd5 exd5 6. O-O Bd6 7. Re1+ Ne7 { I feel cramped} 8. c4 Qb6 {Expanding my reach and indirectly defending d5} 9. Nc3 d4 10. Nd5 Qa5 11. d3 Qd8 12. g3 O-O 13. Bd2 Nxd5 {Finally ridding myself of that looming knight} 14. cxd5 Nf6 15. Bg5 Bh3 {Keeping that king in the corner and the knight vulnerable} 16. Kh1 Be7 17. Bc4 h6 18. Bxf6 Bxf6 19. Rg1 {I dont understand this move giving up the e column and containing the king} Qb6 {Threatening b2 and bringing out rook on a8} 20. Qe2 Rae8 21. Qd2 Qb4 {looking to trap white bishop eventually with b5} 22. Qc2 a5 23. a3 Qb6 {I could not manage to do it} 24. g4 {threatening Rb3 (winning bishop)} h5 {giving up the pawn to prevent it} 25. g5 {?} Be5 26. Nxe5 Rxe5 27. f4 Re3 {I was considering Re6 instead ...dxe6... Qc6+ but he had too many pieces guarding g2. I thought of moving Re3 and then moving a pawn up in an attempt to induce Qxa6 which would remove one of the pieces guarding g2 but then I realized that would put his queen in a position take my queen on c6 should I play Qc6 (in fact this capture would be virtually required). } 28. Qf2 Rfe8 29. Rab1 f6 {This was an error. Not because it allows for the revealed check (this actually helped me) but because I didnt see that the g pawn would be pinned after gxf6 which I think is the correct move for white. } 30. d6+ Kf8 {My earlier plan now falls into place with a mate in the picture. I figured he would now play gxf6 or g6 but...} 31. d7 Qc6+ {I figure I have the game now and I set conditional moves to mate W: Rg2 Me: bxg2 W: Qxg2 Me: Re1+ W: Rxe1 Me: Rxe1# } 32. Rg2 Bxg2+ 33. Qxg2 Re3e1+ {White resigned here and sent me a message saying that he couldn't deal with the "discourteous" conditional moves. I tried to send him a message politely asking why conditional moves were rude but found that he had ignored me. If anyone has an explanation of this view of conditional moves I would like to hear it. Thanks}
