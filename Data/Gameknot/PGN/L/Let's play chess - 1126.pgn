1. e4 c6 {Caro-Kann Defence. This game is the first time - and surprisingly the only time to date - I have encountered it in actual play.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The Advance Variation.} Bf5 4. Nc3 e6 5. g4 {The beginning of an aggressive continuation, the bayonette attack.} Bg6 6. Nge2 {The best deployment for the knight in this variation.} Ne7 {Black adopts a quiet formation originating with Karpov, avoiding the wild tactics that can otherwise occur.} 7. Nf4 Nd7 8. h4 h6 9. Nxg6 Nxg6 10. h5 Ne7 {In the last few moves white has gained some space, weakened some light squares on black's king's side, and removed the light-squared bishop which was protecting them.} 11. Ne2 {Now white regroups in the centre, awaiting black's French-style counter-attack.} c5 12. c3 Nc6 13. f4 cxd4 14. cxd4 {A pawn weakness for white, which black will try to exploit.} Qb6 15. a3 {Preventing Bb4 , which would disrupt white's support for his weak pawn.} Be7 {Black's bishop, though technically "good", no longer has many options.} 16. Bg2 {White's king's side formation may look unusual, but the plan is to exert pressure on black's pawn centre. (This eventually happens, though not until the endgame.)} O-O-O 17. b3 {To allow the development of the other bishop, though this move allows black to create a few problems.} Kb8 18. Qd3 {Still protecting the two pawns, but now also pressuring the weakened light squares f5 and g6.} Rdc8 19. Be3 {Extra protection for d4, though this does not last long.} Na5 20. b4 {Allowing black a knight outpost on f4. This was a conscious decision, banking on being able to generate more important play on the other side of the board.} Nc4 21. Bc1 {Preserving the bishop and shackling the black knight.} Qc7 22. f5 {Now it is once again white's turn to go on the attack.} Ndb6 23. O-O {Not the most comfortable castled position, but at least the rooks are nearly connected.} Rcf8 {This gives white a tactical target.} 24. Nf4 {threatening forks on both e6 and g6 after a pawn exchange.} Qd7 25. Re1 {A sidestep to prevent black's rook escaping from the coming fork with Rxf1 .} Bg5 {This will lead to an exchange of dark squared bishops, which should not ultimately be to black's advantage. Better would have been to admit Rcf8 was a mistake and move it away again.} 26. fxe6 fxe6 27. Ng6 {Now white wins the exchange.} Bxc1 28. Rexc1 Rhg8 29. Nxf8 Rxf8 30. Rcf1 {Seizing the f-file for the rooks, as black can keep the c-file blocked.} Rf7 31. Qg6 {Those weak light squares again...} Rxf1+ 32. Rxf1 Ne3 {Black attempts to find counterplay.} 33. Rf8+ Nc8 {Not Kc7?, otherwise Rf7 !} 34. Kf2 {Putting the question to the intruding knight.} Nc4 {Black obviously judges that this knight is stronger than the bishop - which might appear logical, but that is not how things will work out.} 35. Re8 {The big question for me at this point was to stop black큦 queen coming down the c-file and possibly getting a perpetual (or worse). I thought this plan was the best way of tying her down.} Nxa3 36. Qxe6 Qxe6 {Qc6 would have allowed the pleasing tactic 37 Qd6  Qxd6, 38 ed!} 37. Rxe6 Nc2 38. Bxd5 {The bishop joins the action at last.} Nxb4 39. Be4 {Once again shackling the knight.} a5 {Black's remaing trump is of course this pawn.} 40. Rg6 {White insists on going for the g7 pawn, attacking b7 and securing a winning breakthrough for an eventual pawn ending.} a4 41. Rxg7 Nc6 {Black needs to prevent Rxb7 .} 42. Bxc6 {Disconnecting black큦 passed pawns. It might look as if the white rook is cut off from the a-pawn, but in fact it will reach it in time.} bxc6 43. Ke3 {Getting out of the rook큦 way, while also threatening to enter the a-pawn큦 square.} a3 44. Rf7 Nb6 {A last attempt to make trouble with the knight from d5.} 45. Kd3 {Getting the king off the a7-g1 diagonal in the event of a pawn race after g5.} a2 46. Rf1 Nd5 47. Ra1 Kc7 {Hoping for 48 Rxa2? Nb4! (In fact this would probably still have lost - the knight is too far away from the king´s side pawns.)} 48. Kd2 {1-0. Black resigns because of the breakthrough 49 g5!, where neither king nor knight can catch the h-pawn.} Kd7 49. g5 Ne7 50. gxh6 {}
