[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 {A sound opening move by white.} e6 {A good reply from black, making sure that there is no mate on f7 involving a white bishop on c4. Normally, after 2. d4 d5, we have what is called the French Defence, an interesting opening, with chances for both sides. However neither side seems to be using the Gameknot opening databases, and the game soon takes on a unusual character.} 2. Nf3 {This is a sound developing move, although d4 is more usual.} Nf6 {An excellent move by black, developing a piece and attacking the pawn on e4. If white plays e5 the knight must go to d5, not e4, where it will find it hard to find a safe square!} 3. Nc3 {White defends the pawn and develops a piece, although e5 was more aggressive.} d5 {An excellent move, developing, opening up lines for her pieces and putting pressure on the e4 pawn again.} 4. exd5 {White exchanges. I would prefer the more aggressive e5.} exd5 {This is a sound way to recapture, now both black bishops can develop freely. Surprisingly, on the Gameknot opening database, Nxd5 scores better.} 5. Bb5+ {Not really developing with gain of time, as after c6 the bishop must retreat, in this case to e2. So why not play Be2 straight away, rather than freely let black reinforce her pawn on d5?} c6 {So black plays the correct counter.} 6. Be2 {and off the qhite bishop goes. The post-match computer analysis gives this position as equal and I have to agree. Black as already equalised, which is an achievement, and unusual after just 6 moves.} Bb4 {Black develops the bishop to a sensible square.} 7. a3 {White attacks the bishop.} Qa5 {Instead of retreating, Black sets a clever trap. If white takes the bishop, the rook falls to the queen. But if the bishop isn't taken, how will the queen side be developed? b3, d3 or d4 all lose a pawn to black taking twice on c6.} 8. h3 {I'm not sure that this was really necessary. I think just O-O immediately was better.} O-O {Black wisely castles too.} 9. Na2 {So this is how white decides to slove his problem of how to develop the queen's side.} Bd6 {But on d6 the bishop is aiming right at white's king side.} 10. b4 {The queen is driven back too.} Qd8 {Computer gives black a slight edge here.} 11. d3 {White continues to develop.} Bf5 {As does black.} 12. Nd4 {Attacking the bishop.} Qe8 {Which black doesn' seem to notice! White could just go a clear bishop up here, and black would have no compensation at all!} 13. O-O {And perhaps white didn't notice either!} Qe5 {Was black protecting the bishop? Or was there another motive for playing this move?} 14. Bb2 {If it wasn't for the checkmate being on, this would be a good move, protecting the knight. However there wasn't anything much better, as both mate at h2 and the knight on d4 were threatened, and white couldn't play Nf3 as then the rook on a1 goes(and after that the knight on a2)} Qh2# {So black wins! Apart for the one move - the 12th which should have lost black a bishop, and the game, black played well. What do you think dear reader? Please leave comments and rate my annotation!
