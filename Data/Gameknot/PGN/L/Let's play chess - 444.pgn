[Opening "Bird's opening (A03), Lasker variation"]

1. f4 {This was an uncommon Bird's opening, we were out of theory just after move 5, both black and white's light square bishops were exchanged by knights, but white allowed some damage to his pawn structure, white then followed a good plan to fianchetto his remaining bishop queen side, but with a bad timing he wasn't able to change his plan according to black's moves and lost a pawn and allowed further damage to his pawn structure, black was a bit underdeveloped, but white willingness to exchange the queens and the rooks allowed them an superior endgame B + extra pawn vs N, finaly I'll sacrifice a pawn to get the white king out of the fight and to force a promotion of my c pawn and to finally convert the advantage... } d5 2. Nf3 {Bird's opening, Lasker variation, I'm currently playing two games with Lasker's variation of Bird's Opening, this one with black pieces} Bg4 3. e3 Nc6 {Nf6 is also fine for black} 4. Bb5 {and this pin is the best white has...} Qd7 {as black doesn't want to compromise his pawn structure, I chose here a different move from the other game, were white played Qd6, the main purpose is similar to protect the knight, and after exchange, if it ever occurs, the position will be the same...} 5. b3 {fianchetto queen side will help white a better control over key square e5} a6 {I'm the first to deviate from previous games, e6 (1-0) and 0-0-0 (0-1), were the moves already tried in this position, now white has to decide upon Be2, the best in my opinion, or Bxc6 giving up the bishop pair for nothing.} 6. Bxc6 Qxc6 {and now black has successfully prepared the exchange forcing white to decide to double pawns or to lose a pawn...} 7. Bb2 {...but white didn't understood it and keep playing according to the previous plan, better was 0-0, and white could have recaptured with the rook after Bxf3} Bxf3 8. gxf3 {white decided to double pawns if Qxf3 then Qxc2 wins a pawn for black} Nh6 {preparing Nf5 and d4} 9. Nc3 {? again keeping up with the previous plan, better was to postpone the development of the knight, to keep the control of the d4 and e5} Nf5 10. Qe2 {I don't see the point of this move by white, but the important is that it allows for my pawn break to still be on} d4 {the pawn break makes even more sense than before Nc3, now if exd4 Nxd4 recaptures with tempo as it attacks the white queen, and forks c2 and f3 (a triple fork) then Qd1 is the best for white Nxf3+} 11. Ne4 Qxc2 {white forgot c2} 12. Bxd4 Nxd4 13. exd4 {after the sequence of exchanges white is clearly worst as it has two sets of doubled pawns...} Qb2 {black is still underdeveloped but wins one pawn with this double attack by the queen} 14. O-O {connecting the rooks} Qxd4+ 15. Qe3 {? this allows black to simplify his task, the pawn majority on queen's wing might became decisive} Qxe3+ {allows white a slightly better pawn structure, but the lack of queens on the board, represents less worries with defence for black} 16. dxe3 e6 {now black has to develop his last piece and connect the rooks} 17. Rfd1 Ba3 {blocking the queen side pawns} 18. Rd3 {to double rooks} Rd8 {forced so white can't double rooks on the open column} 19. Rad1 Ke7 {connecting rooks} 20. Rd3xd8 Rxd8 21. Rxd8 Kxd8 {and white exchanged (?) rooks, entering a N vs B endgame with a pawn less, is not a good choice} 22. Ng5 Ke7 {the idea is if 23.Nxh7, black can capture the knight with 23...f6 to trap the knight 24.h4 white last chance is to get to h5 to control g6 24...Kf7 25.h5 Kg8 and the knight is lost, and so is the game as is just a matter of technic } 23. Kf2 h6 24. Ne4 f5 {black just improved his pawns with tempo by attacking the knight} 25. Nc3 g5 {now allows white to undouble his pawns, but gains space in the process} 26. fxg5 hxg5 27. Kg3 b5 {to limit knight access to a4} 28. h4 {?? blunder allows Bb4 to gain one tempo and play Be1 to skewer the h4 pawn} Bb4 {... gains one tempo} 29. Ne2 Be1+ {...skewers h4} 30. Kh3 gxh4 {isolating the h pawn to engage the king to it's defence} 31. Nf4 {maybe with the idea Ng6+ but after Kd6, if white plays Nxh5, then Bxh5 wins because white king would be out of the fight far away from the queens wing were my pawn majority is sufficient to promote} a5 {Zugzwang, leaving white with the choice, anyway the fight would be king against knight, with the bishop to win any occasional tempi if needed} 32. Ng6+ Kd6 {Now black will bring the king to the opposite wing and if white decides by the exchange on h4, then white's king will be to far to fight against promotion} 33. Nxh4 Bxh4 {to finish any possible counterplay } 34. Kxh4 Kd5 35. Kg5 c5 {and now pushing the queen's wing pawns I'll promote the c pawn... and win the game} 36. Kf4 c4 {two options here for white: a) e4+ fxe4 fxe4+ (Ke3 to try to get to the queens wing is countered by exf3 and white's king is forced back to the f column) Kd4 gains opposition and achieves the promotion  b) bxc4 bxc4 (creates an isolated pawn) e4+ Kd4 (gains the opposition, also possible is fxe4 similar to the first variation)} 37. bxc4+ bxc4 38. e4+ Kd4 39. exf5 exf5 {and now my c pawn will promote in 3 moves, while white needs 6 moves to promote his f pawn} 40. Kxf5 c3 41. Ke6 c2 42. f4 c1=Q 43. f5 Qc6+ 44. Ke7 Ke5 {}
