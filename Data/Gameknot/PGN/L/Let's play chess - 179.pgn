1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 c5 {This setup can often leave Black with an isolated pawn--which can be good or bad depending on the activity it gives the pieces.} 4. cxd5 exd5 5. dxc5 Bxc5 {Black's d-pawn is now isolated and can become a target.} 6. g3 h6 {It's not clear if h6 is useful since White's dark-square Bishop has good squares besides g5.} 7. Bg2 Nf6 8. O-O O-O 9. Nc3 d4 {This push to d4 loses the pawn.  It's attacked twice and defended twice right now, but one of the defenders can be removed.} 10. Na4 Bb6 11. Nxb6 Qxb6 {Now that the defender has been removed, the pawn is loose.} 12. Qxd4 Qxd4 13. Nxd4 {White is now a pawn up.  In addition, Black's development will be slowed by the centralized N.  Black can't move the B with dropping the b pawn.  And if the N moves to c6, the b pawn also hangs.} Rd8 14. e3 Na6 15. Bd2 Nc5 16. Bc3 {The B on c3 threatens to eventually create another weakness by capturing on f6.} Nce4 17. Rac1 {Recapturing with the pawn on c3 would leave an isolated pawn on an open file to become a target.} Nc5 18. Rfd1 Bg4 19. Nf3 Rxd1+ 20. Rxd1 Nce4 21. Rc1 Bxf3 22. Bxf3 Nxc3 23. Rxc3 Rb8 24. Rc7 {b7 is now a target.  If the b-pawn moves, the a-pawn hangs.} Ne8 25. Rxb7 {Winning a second pawn.} Ra8 {This allows a discovered attack on the a8 R, which wins another pawn.} 26. Rxf7 {If Kxf7, Bxa8.} Rb8 27. Rb7 Rxb7 28. Bxb7 {White is winning here.  There are pawn majorities on both sides of the board.  The e-pawn is now a passed pawn.  And with pawns on both sides, the B should be superior to the N due to its speed.} Nd6 29. Bd5+ Kf8 30. Kf1 {Ideally, one would keep K and B on opposite-colored squares to avoid the possibility of a fork.  Barring that, pay attention!} Ke7 31. Ke2 Nc8 32. b3 Nb6 33. Bc4 {If Nxc4, White has a second passed pawn.} Kf6 34. e4 a5 35. Ke3 Nd7 36. f4 Nb6 37. g4 g5 {The idea to break up the White pawns is a good one, but here White has a check.} 38. e5+ Ke7 39. f5 {Now White has two passed pawns.  Black's h-pawn is also backward and can't move without being captured and creating another passer.} Nd7 40. Kd4 Nb8 {Since b5 is available for White's B, moving to b8 gives White's B the opportunity to dominate the N by covering all of its available squares.  } 41. Bb5 Nd7 42. Bxd7 Kxd7 {White can't lose now.  Black's pawns are frozen.  White already has two passed pawns on the Kingside and can create a third by force on the Queenside.  Black's lone K will not be able to stop them all.} 43. Kc5 {Black correctly resigned here.  The passed pawns will not be able to be stopped.}
