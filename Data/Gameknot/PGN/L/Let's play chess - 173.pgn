1. e4 d6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. d4 Bg7 5. Be3 O-O 6. Be2 c6 7. O-O Nbd7 8. Qd2 b5 {I've been experimenting with this setup for Black, but here White did a good job controlling the center and I felt like Black's position was a little cramped.} 9. a3 Bb7 10. Ng5 a6 11. f4 c5 12. dxc5 {I felt that White had the space advantage and that exchanging helps Black open up the board.} h6 13. e5 dxe5 14. fxe5 Nxe5 15. Nf3 Nxf3+ 16. Bxf3 Qxd2 17. Bxd2 Bxf3 18. Rxf3 {Both players have passed pawns.  It's a matter of how effectively they can be blockaded.} Rac8 19. b4 Rfd8 20. Rd3 Ne4 21. Nd5 Rxd5 22. Rxd5 Bxa1 23. Be3 {Black is now up  a piece.  If everything else gets traded off, this should be winning.} Nf6 24. Rd3 Kg7 25. h3 Be5 26. c3 Ne4 27. Bd4 Bxd4+ 28. cxd4 Nf6 29. Kf2 Nd5 {d5 is a good square for the N, especially since it is difficult to dislodge.} 30. Kf3 e6 31. Ke4 f6 {Now White's K cannot penetrate to e5.} 32. g4 g5 {Freezing the h pawn.} 33. Rf3 Kf7 34. Kd3 Ke7 35. Ke4 Kf7 36. Rd3 Kg6 37. Rf3 h5 38. Rd3 hxg4 39. hxg4 Rh8 {Now the R will penetrate and cause all sorts of problems for White.}
