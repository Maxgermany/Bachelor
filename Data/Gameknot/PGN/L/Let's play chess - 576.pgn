1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {Berlin Defense} 4. O-O a6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 Bb7 7. c3 d6 {? Oops, the correct move-order would be 7 ... Be7 and then 8 ... d6. This allows a position reminiscent of the Two Knights defense.} 8. Ng5 {Here it comes!} d5 {Forced.} 9. exd5 Na5 10. d6 Qxd6 {Now that I annotate this game I see that I should have played 10 ... Nxb3 11. Qxb3 Bd5, and I win the pawn back with approximate equality. But in the game I was only looking for counterplay along the h1-a8 diagonal.} 11. Nxf7 Qc6 {Threatening mate.} 12. f3 {Forced. 12. Qf3 is bad because of 12 ... Qxf3 13. gxf3 Nxb3.} Nxb3 {To remove a defender of the d4-square.} 13. Qxb3 Bc5+ 14. d4 exd4 15. Nxh8 {I'm behind a rook, and with no opportunity to make material equal, I would normally give up, but my bishops-queen force looks dangerous enough to play on for a while.} d3+ {Of course this is much better than 15 ... dxc3+ when I will lose my pawn and rendering it possible for his knight to come to its most natural spot.} 16. Kh1 O-O-O {Before I continue with my attack, I must first remove my king from danger and activate my last piece.} 17. Nf7 Re8 18. Bf4 {While it's hard to criticize such a natural developing move, I've got a feeling that this bishop move, along with his next move, gave me additional possibilities. The bishop should have stayed on the c1-h6 diagonal.} Ng4 {The knight cannot be captured because of mate on g2. The knight eyes some important squares and is threatening to win the exchange or the f4-bishop (after 20 ... Nf2+ 21. Kg1 Nh3++. Note that only his dark-squared bishop and f1-rook are performing defensive duties, while I've more or less got both my bishops, queen, rook and knight in the action. A 2-5 advantage!} 19. Bg3 {Not that good. While it's natural and probably his intention when he played 18, Bf4, this bishop move lets e3 fall completely under my control. A simple h3 would have sufficed, not losing contact with the e3-square.} Ne3 {Winning the exchange. The rook on f1 is attacked, and when it moves, the rook on a1 is lost. See: 20. Re1 Nc2 21. Rxe8+ Qxe8, and the a1-rook is doomed since it hopelessly blocked. I don't even lose my knight since it can comfortably hop back to c2. } 20. Nd2 {The best. White acknowledges the lost exchange but now he's still a knight up while my attacking changes have diminished with the removal of material and accumulation of White's forces nearer his king.} Nxf1 21. Rxf1 Be3 {I should probably give up, but this move has got some sting to it. The knight should not centralize itself, no matter how natural it is.} 22. Ne4 {?} Rxe4 {Returning the exchange!} 23. fxe4 {?? Material was still equal at this point, and White should simply accept the loss of the knight.} Qxe4 {White's is suddenly unable to protect g2. 24. Rf3 fails to 24 ... Qxf3! 25. gxf3 Bxf3# with a nice two-bishop mate. Meanwhile, my advanced pawn is still there...} 24. Nd6+ {Forced in order to prolong the game.} cxd6 25. Rf8+ Kc7 26. Qf7+ Kb6 27. Qf3 {Forced. Notice that if White's bishop would not be on g3, White would have had the option of grabbing the pawn at g7 and protecting g2. This move leads to a lost endgame.} Qxf3 28. gxf3 d2 {And my passed pawn is impossible to stop. White gave up here. An enjoyable game, and a sour end for White. This game shows that one (two!) wrong moves can drastically change the position.}
