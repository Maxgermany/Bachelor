1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bxf6 {The other option is 6. Bh4 usaully leads to sharper lines. In this case I had no desire to play into complications. I prefer 6. Bxf6 because it removes a critical defender of d5 and put the dark bishop on a less active diagonal. The trade off is that I loss the long term advantage of the two bishops. } Bxf6 7. e3 {the most solid move that keeps the position closed and thus favoring knights. 7. e4 leads to open positions where black can enjoy his two bishops. } O-O 8. Qb3 {In the Queen gambit declined whites most pressing problem is where to develop the queen. Expereince bears witness to the fact that black easily equalizes after Qb3, Qc2 and Qe2. } c6 {Black can go with the less stable but very playable semi-tarrasach defence with ...c5. The main idea of c6 is to support d5 and a b7-b5 counterattack} 9. h4 {my intention is to play g4-g5 and create lines to the king. By castling long my rooks are going to enjoy a lot of freedom on the kingside.} dxc4 {Black clears the strong d5 point for use} 10. Bxc4 Nd7 {for black the most difficult problem in the openning is to develop the light bishop. Typically this is acheived through ...b6-Bb7 or a ...e5 break. } 11. g4 {I have a slight lead in development so I want to take advantage of this plus by mounting a quick pawn storm before black has a chance to catch up. This strategy is designed to push and pressure my opponent to make a mistake. However, if black plays calm and strong defence this can prove inadequate } b5 {the correct response! black needs to pace with the game} 12. Be2 Bb7 {black has not taken seriously the threat of g4-g5 and now white will stickit to him. } 13. g5 {forcing the opening of lines to the king. Is the first step in a successful attack. } hxg5 14. hxg5 Bxg5 15. O-O-O {now white has many unplesant threats such as Ne4, Rg1 and e4} Bh6 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 {seizing control of the d file and freezing the centre. Thus black is in serious trouble as he can not marshall forces quickly enough to mount a defend} Qc7 18. Rdg1 Kh8 {If 18. ...Qxe5 then 19. Rxh6! wins material.} 19. Qb4 {adding another attacker. } f5 {the only move that helps because now if white plans to sac on h6 black can save himself with ...Qh7} 20. Rg6 {guaranteed a pawn. } Rf7 21. Rxe6 c5 22. Rhxh6+ gxh6 23. Qf4 {playing 23. Rxh6 is not accurate as it is stronger on this square. 23. Qf4 allows for the queen to take on h6 with all kinds of threats } a6 24. Bd3 {not 24. Qxh6+ Rh7 and white's advantage is slippping away. } Raf8 25. Qxh6+ Kg8 26. Bxf5 Rg7 27. e4 {In truth I do not like this move because my attack has stalled. In order to win I still have to solve the problem of my inactive knight. I had hoped for the manoveur Ne4-Nf6 but the strength of blacks bishop rules this out. Other possiblilies would be Ne2-Nf4, but that would open up ...Bd5 for black which is not good for me. Black for the moment is staying alive and is hoping for a white blunder.   There is no really opportunity for white to press in with the attack so by playing 27. e4 as respite is ok because it frees me to play ne2-Nf4 without fear of ...Bd5. I however could not prevent all of blacks counter chances so...} Rg1+ {before playing 27. e4 I made sure that I could allow black his moment of flurry without harm. } 28. Kc2 {Black's flurry is over and now he has to go back to defense.} Qg7 29. Qh4 Bxe4+ {? this is not as soild as 29. ...Rh1 30. Qxh1 Rxf5 31. Qh2 where black has made some solid progress in defending. } 30. Bxe4 Rg4 31. Qh2 Qh8 {forcing the exchange of queens but now the white pawns become desicive. When you have the advantage of active past pawns then exchanges of pieces usaully increase the strenght of these pawns.} 32. Qxh8+ Kxh8 33. f3 Rg2+ 34. Kb3 c4+ 35. Ka3 Rb8 {black has counterplay with ...B4+ so white has to take that seriously but how?} 36. Nd5 {defending against ...b4+ that allows black a few move but nothing that I cannot handle. Less accurate is 36. Kb4 Rxb2 37. Ka3 Rg2 when black has a chance to make life for the white king difficult.    } b4+ 37. Nxb4 Rb5 38. Re8+ Kg7 39. Nd5 Rd2 {hold back the pawn to f5 because of the threat of capture on d5. } 40. Re7+ Kf8 41. Rd7 {now d5 is well covered and the pawn is free to advance. Black resigns as he had quite enough in defending. }
