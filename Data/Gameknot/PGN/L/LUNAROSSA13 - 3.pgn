[Opening "Beefeater defence (A40)"]

1. d4 {started with a d4 opening} g6 2. c4 {transposed immediately in the english} Bg7 {in my opinion, this defense is the safest. But i recognized that black will soon find problem on the queen side.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {still nothing on the center. It is the plan. This black knight is one of the most important pieces in the game.} 4. e4 {I like to play that with white too. As far as it goes, i'd play the same from the other side.} d6 5. Nf3 Bg4 {This is something I play a lot, as I generally don't know what to do with this clear black bishop, and the knights are dangerous pieces in the closed english} 6. Be2 O-O 7. O-O {and now starts the real position where black goes on f-g columns and white on b-c.} c5 {oups... no... so, did I lie? No: black just tries to block queen side, as you will see. But it won't really work} 8. Be3 {white clearly views queen-side.} b6 9. h3 {...and defend king-side} Bxf3 {exits one knight} 10. Bxf3 {exit my dubious bishop. I won't cry for him. And his white bishop loses a move here. It will be important as we will see.} e5 {trying to open on the center. May be over confident, as I haven't finished my development, unlike white.} 11. d5 {white closes the center. The battle really will be on the flanks.} Na6 {he is a defender. Will not see the ocean on the king side.} 12. a3 {defending b4 and preparing... b4 :-)} Nc7 13. b4 {white is on the move BEFORE black...} Rb8 14. Rb1 h6 {finally a first move on the king side. Looked like I forgot it... But no, i just assured the lemmo "defense first".} 15. Nb5 {forces the next move. Was it really useful? I am not sure as it exchanges a good knight against a bad one. But it will contribute to open b-line.} Nxb5 16. cxb5 {Now, I prefer black position, but it won't last.} Qd7 17. bxc5 bxc5 {I have one big advantage, theoretically: the clear white bishop, which is necessary to the attack, is blocked by the defense of e4. But white could easily poses the queen on c2 and free the bishop. I am surprised he never did that... On the other side...} 18. a4 {... white has a tremendous advantage here: a potential passed pawn!} Rb7 {hesitating on the defense.} 19. Be2 {?!} Nxe4 {I haven't seen the trap, therefore, there is no trap.} 20. Qc2 {a bit late?} f5 {black pawns are on their move. I feel comfortable here. Maybe too optimistic (as frequently)} 21. f3 {strange, to my opinion. I have been surprised by this defense. I really think white has to concentrate on his attack, and it helps me on mine} Ng3 {i think it is better than getting back home, cause I have to attack.} 22. Rfe1 {Maybe I should have taken the clear bishop, here, as it is an important attack piece to a-b attack.} f4 {But i decided to continue my attack} 23. Bf2 Nf5 {and still think that my knight has a big potential.} 24. Bd3 {so does he, maybe. I think he should have concentrated more effort on his nice potential attack on a-b side.} Qc8 {would you believe it? I had no clear idea here... I made some approximations.} 25. a5 Qb8 {confused, really.} 26. Rb2 {?!? really dubious, as the next moves clearly gives me an advantage. Or so i think.} e4 {opening the diagonal and attacking simultaneously the bishop and the rook.} 27. fxe4 {yes, taking the pawn is the best option.saving the rook would loses a bishop for a pawn.} Ne3 {Not Bxb2 immediately, as it is followed by exf and white recuperates a good pawn on g6.} 28. Bxe3 {the only viable option here} Bxb2 {now, white has to make a bad choice: taking my bishop or saving his...} 29. Qxb2 {he takes mine...} fxe3 {... so i take his.} 30. Rxe3 {well, it looks like I still have the same advantage, considering the captured scale. And white still has his fine attack, but there is much more than that. Look weel: white has the diagonal h8-a1, a potential attack on e5 with the pawn, and opening the diagonal for the bishop on g6... so, do I have to be glad of my quality advantage? It is not really clear. I had a lot of doubts, here, after I foud myself very proud of the 26th move...} Kh7 {protecting g6} 31. Rg3 {attacking g6 with potential e4-e5} Qe8 {protecting g6, but also and mostly pointing to e5.} 32. Qe2 {pointing the attack on the same spot: g6} Qe5 {blocking the bishop. This same old bishop i refused to take some moves ago... I open some opportunities here, like Qd4+, Qa1+ and threatening the rook.} 33. Qg4 {this is much more thant just pointing on g6: it is saying to the rooks: stay on your lines! If not, I go on 7th or 8th line. It is a competent move, looking confident, and I thought to myself: this game is going to last... It is strange to feel as the mouse in the game, when I am supposed to have a good advantage.} Rg7 {ok, i stay on my line, but I protect my g6 essential point.} 34. Rf3 {i guess white has no more idea...} Rgf7 {and here white resigns... I have no doubt he could have resisted much more, testing me by going back to g3, for example, moving the pawn h3, h4, h5... My plan was to try to find a way to play g5 or h5, then to play Rf4. So, I guessed white intended here to exchange his rook against the other one and to advance the pawns AFTER having put the bishop under safety (I am potentially threatening Qd4+, remember). I suppose white has no more passion in the game. Too bad, because I wanted to try myself here...}
