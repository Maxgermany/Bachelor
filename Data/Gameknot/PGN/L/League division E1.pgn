[Opening "Greco defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {Let me start with a disclaimer: this is my first annotated game and I have no idea if a game like this one is even interesting for the majority of players here. Still, I enjoyed this game myself as it features a non-standard opening and to me demonstrates the danger of developing your queen too early.} e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 {?! This is the Greco defense (apparently). First time I'm facing this. I find it a curious opening because of the queen potentially becoming a target.} 3. Nc3 {I decide to just develop as usual.} c6 {? Labelled as a mistake by the engine. The idea, I guess, is to take away the d5 square for my knight, but I wasn't planning on going for the queen just yet.} 4. d4 {Going for the center.} h6 {? Another mistake according to the engine - it favors ...d6.} 5. Nxe5 {I need to make a judgement call here: do I grab with the pawn or the knight? In the end I choose the latter because I prefer to keep my pawns in the center intact for now.} d6 {That comes at the cost of having to move my knight a third time, of course.} 6. Nf3 g5 7. e5 {I decide it's time to go after the queen. I don't have hopes of capturing her, but I'm counting on being able to increase my development advantage.} dxe5 8. dxe5 Qg6 9. Bd3 {As I hoped, I'm now able to develop my bishop with tempo.} f5 {?? While the idea doesn't look that bad at first glance, in reality this move does nothing to mitigate the attack on the queen, nor helps with the development disadvantage. Labelled a blunder by the engine.} 10. exf6 e.p. Qxf6 11. O-O {After the pawns are off the board, I remind myself to calmly develop first.} Ne7 12. Re1 {Jumping at the opportunity to pin the knight. This pin will prove to be very useful later down the road.} Nd7 13. Ne4 {While I temporary remove the pin on the king with this move, it does force the queen to move again, which makes this knight advancement come with tempo.} Qg7 14. Rb1 {I'm now eyeing those nicely aligned queen and rook. The attack that I'm preparing is unfortunately slow, but it does give something useful to do for my still undeveloped rook and bishop.} g4 15. Nh4 {I don't really mind having to move my knight here. It is quite safe and is eyeing down the f5 square with an attack on the queen (although I would need to restore the pin on the e2 knight first of course).} h5 16. b4 {Continuing with my very telegraphed attack on the queen and rook. I'm hoping to disguise it by moving the pawn to b4 instead of b3...} Rg8 {... but unfortunately my opponent sees right through it.} 17. Nd6+ {Time, then, for plan B. I'm going to start building pressure on the quite exposed black king.} Kd8 {Forced.} 18. Nhf5 {I'm counting on exchanging knights here, which will remove one of the black king's defenders.} Nxf5 19. Bxf5 Bxd6 20. Qxd6 {Although I still have just a measly pawn in material advantage, the situation is starting to look very menacing for black. He will need to do something about the very immediate threat of the queen, rook and bishop that are aimed at his king.} Re8 {?? ... but this was not how. Black is likely expecting an exchange of rooks, which would reduce a lot of the bite of my attack. But that was not the plan. I have a forced mate in 6 now, which I actually did not see yet at this stage, although I did see the best move to pile on black's misery.} 21. Bf4 {Now threatening 22. Qc7#.} Re7 22. Rbd1 {This is actually not the most efficient move, although I still have a mate in 7. Apparently. Whoever finds it gets a cookie :)} Rxe1+ {This makes things a little easier, actually.} 23. Rxe1 {Black can now really only do silly moves to gain time...} b6 {... which he decides not to.} 24. Qc7# {Checkmate. I always like winning games where I have little to no material advantage. Most noteworthy of this game, for me, is how awkward the early queen development turned out for black. The queen has done absolutely nothing for black, but allowed me to develop my pieces with tempo twice.  This is just my second game I played flawlessly according to the engine, and I'm quite proud of it. Hopefully it was insightful for you as well.}
