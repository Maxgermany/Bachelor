1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 {The fiachetto is probably the best structure against the London attack. This doesn't mean I won't play my favorite plan against it. The first thing to do is to block the action of a future black bishop... on f5! The black squared bishop will aim to a solid pawn wall (c3), and it is not dangerous itself. } 3. Bf4 Bg7 4. h3 {This move is necessary so, in case of Af5, g4. Of course, the side-effect is to provide a square for the bsb in case of an early Nh5. } d6 5. e3 O-O 6. g4 {Af5 prevented. Some play Be6, here... and it is not as bad as it seems. } b6 {But black has the other right plan. } 7. c4 {I decide to sacrify the pawn wall against the bsb by providing a block against the wsb with d5. } Bb7 8. Nc3 Nbd7 9. Be2 {Tempting him to try to exploit the pin over the f3 knight. } Ne4 {My plan should have been h4, here, trying to attack soon his king. This moves allows him to open my future castling on the queenside. } 10. Qc2 Nxc3 {My queen move was bad. I cannot take with the queen, because of e5. } 11. bxc3 e6 {Here, he could have played e5. } 12. Rh2 {So I prevented it. The idea is to castle queenside (or Kd2, also possible) and get my rooks on his king. But it is not a straight-forward plan.} d5 13. h4 dxc4 14. h5 {I was almost forced to attack a bit too soon. } b5 15. hxg6 hxg6 {I though he would have taken with the f7 pawn.  Here, one of the variants I found interesting:    16.	Nh4	Nf6 17.	Nxg6	f7xg6 18.	Qxg6	Qe8 19.	Qxe8	Ra8xe8 20.	g4-g5 Nd5 21.	Be5	Bxe5 22.	dxe5	Nxc3 23.	Bg4	Nxe4 24.	Bg6	Re7 25.

The right move here is Qg8+ and exchanging queens. But I am a piece under!} 25. exd4 Qf6 {I didn't see here the threat Qf4... now, I tried a lot of ways to preserve my attack, but they doesn't work. Qg8+, Ke7, h7 would be a good try, but Qf4+ and then QxRh2 destroys me. } 26. Rf2 Qxg6 {without the queen, my game is technically lost. The pawn itself is not enough to give me compensation. } 27.

Rg2 Kf7 {The advance of the d pawn doesn't lead me to recover the pawn. Again, I have to lose one tempo defending c3, and this gives him the time to go Rh8, and my pawn is lost. I calculated if in this case the d pawn could have brought me something, but it was not so... so I resigned. }
