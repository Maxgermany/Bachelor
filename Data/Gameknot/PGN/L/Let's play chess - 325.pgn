1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 {Ha ha.  He thinks you have never seen the bad four move.  The GOOD four move puts the queen at f3, where the mate is slightly less obvious and harder to defend.} Nf6 {Not quite.  Pd6 would be a better answer.} 3. Qxe5+ Qe7 {Ouch.  Here I would choose Be7.} 4. Qxc7 Qxe4+ 5. Be2 Qxg2 6. Qe5+ Kd8 7. d4 {What?  Bf3 at least protects the rook.} Qxh1 8. Qg3 Ne4 {Should have moved the queen out.  Bf3 traps her in the corner. Nobody puts baby in the corner!} 9. Qe3 {? QxN!} d5 10. f3 Nf6 11. Kd2 Qxh2 12. f4 Ne4+ 13. Kd3 Nf2+ {Yes.} 14. Kc3 Qxg1 15. Nd2 {Ooh, ooh, Nd1+!  Followed by NxQ or QxQ.} Nd1+ {Beautiful!} 16. Kd3 Qxe3# {Yeah, baby!}
