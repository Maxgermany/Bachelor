1. d4 {A short and tought game, in which my opponent probably thinks that he has a strong attack, and in few moves gets in trouble. I like to win, but I won't like to be in his skin. } Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bf4 Bg7 4. c3 d6 5. h3 O-O 6. g4 Nd5 7. Bg3 f5 {I like his plan till far. When I took this pawn, I wasn't sure at all it was a good idea, and prepared myself to defend, trying to expell his white bishop from the strong position it will get.} 8. gxf5 Bxf5 9. Nbd2 Nf6 10. Nh4 {Luckily, I found that the symmetric move for him, Nh5, wouldn't be as good for him as for me. He, apparently, didn't thought the same, and played it. } Nh5 11. Nxf5 Rxf5 12. Bh4 {Now, I spent a lot calculating his Rf4, and my Bg5. You see, it seems that f2 is weak, black has the open f column and two pieces into the attack, and easily the queen can go to f8... nevertheless, the white position is not as weak as it seem, and there is no real danger, if I play with care. The trick is not to take away the bishop from the f2-h4 diagonal. His move would have been g5!, to which I would have played e4...} Qf8 13. Qb3+ {Oooopss...} Kh8 14. e4 {Maybe this one it is not necessary, but I admit I was tempting him to...} Rf4 15. Bg5 Rxf2 {Well, f2 seems very tasteful, but...} 16. Qxb7 {Overloaded black queen...} Nd7 17. Bxe7 {Ok, black loses something here, but... maybe it was early to resign. }
