1. e4 e5 2. f4 {King's Gambit.} d6 3. Nf3 exf4 {Transposed to a Fischer Defense.} 4. d4 {White takes the center.} c5 {Black challenges white's center.} 5. Nc3 {White threatens to move to the coveted d5 square.} Ne7 {Black blocks white's threat.} 6. Bxf4 cxd4 7. Qxd4 {Black's weak queenside poses little threat to an early deployment of the queen. This also opens up white's queenside castle.} Nbc6 8. Qa4 {The knight will remain pinned to the king for the majority of the game.} d5 {Black again challenges white's center.} 9. O-O-O dxe4 {A serious blunder.} 10. Rxd8+ Kxd8 11. Nxe4 Nd5 {Four little knights, all in a row.} 12. g3 {White is looking for opportunities to trade in order to widen his lead.} Nxf4 {Black is eager to oblige.} 13. gxf4 {White has the only remaining center pawn.} Be6 {Black is looking to hem in White's queen, while developing his own pieces.} 14. Bc4 {White is looking for more trading opportunities.} b5 {This doesn't make much sense.} 15. Qxb5 Rc8 16. Bxe6 {White jumps the gun on the bishop trade.} fxe6 17. Nfg5 {White threatens to fork at the f7 square.} e5 {In his zeal for controlling the center, Black fails to prevent the f7 fork.} 18. Nf7+ Ke8 {Possibly not the best square for the Black king, as it re-pins his knight.} 19. Nxh8 exf4 20. Re1 {White is looking for a discovered check.} f3 {Bad move.} 21. Nd6+ Kd7 22. Nxc8 Kxc8 23. Qxc6+ {You have no chance to survive.} Kb8 24. Re8# {All too easy.  Edit: Thanks to everybody who commented on this game, a good point about that Rd1. In defense of black, this was my father and he was buried in work, which is why he didn't have his strongest game out :)}
