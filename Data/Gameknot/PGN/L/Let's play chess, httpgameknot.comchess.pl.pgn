1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. g3 d5 5. d4 dxc4 {better was e6 to consolidate your centre and prevent d5 } 6. d5 Nb4 7. e4 {and now the centre is mine } b5 {there are more important things to do than protect c4. eg Bg4 or Nd3+  } 8. a3 Qa5 9. e5 Nfxd5 {should take with the other N - Nbxd5. gets your N out of trouble and opens a diagonal to the K for your Q } 10. axb4 Qxa1 {correct was Nxc3 offering a Q swap. But taking the R is a really bad move. When a piece is offered for free then you should look for the hook inside it. } 11. Nxd5 Bd7 {better was f6 opening an escape line for the K } 12. Nc7+ Kd8 13. e6 Kxc7 {just sets things up for a check with discovered attack on the Q. Desperation measure was Qxc1 getting rid of my B and forcing the Q off the d-file } 14. Bf4+ Kb6 {better was Kd8 or Kb7 Puts the K in a better place } 15. Qxa1 {and now whatever you play it is soon mate } Bxe6 16. Qa5+ Kc6 17. Qc7+ Kd5 18. Qb7# {}
