[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {Hello everybody! This is a game that i won before few days and i quite liked it! Well i started with e4.} e5 {He played e5. He would have played the Sicilian also!} 2. Nf3 {Open the knight. I don't prefer d4 or Nc3.} f6 {That was a weak move i think as it affects king's defence and the hole kingside anyway.} 3. d4 {I choosed d4, though i had also something else in my mind which i think it was stronger. 3.Ng5 fxg5 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qxe5 Ne7 6.Qxh8! What do you think of that?} Bb4+ {Ok a check then!} 4. c3 {I played c3 to keep the bishop back instead Nc3.} Bd6 {He moved it back.} 5. dxe5 {I took the pawn. I could have played Bc4 instead. What do you think it'll be better?} fxe5 {He took it.} 6. Bc4 {Now i opened the bishop. I wanted to attack in the f7 square.} Nf6 {Logical i think.} 7. Ng5 {I moved on with the knight.} Rf8 {Strange move and bad i think. He should have played 0-0 i guess.} 8. Nxh7 {And now the plan is simple. Exchange at first the knight in order to have a clean and free road for my queen to move on h5 square.} Nxh7 {He took it and that's what i wanted. Maybe he ignored the threat. But the threat was not ignored him at all!} 9. Qh5+ {Check with the queen.} Ke7 {In order to a avoid checkmate.} 10. Qxh7 {I took his knight of course to clean the road.} Ke8 {He played with the king.} 11. Qg6+ {He can't avoid my queen now.} Ke7 {Avoid checkmate.} 12. Bg5+ {Now the other bishop back there was now really useful!} Rf6 {Last hope i think.} 13. Qxg7+ {But the queen is still there and he finally resigned. I hope you like it. Feel free to write any comments or rate the game if you want! Bye and have luck in your games!}
