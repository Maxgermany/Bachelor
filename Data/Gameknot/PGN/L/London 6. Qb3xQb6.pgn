1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bf4 c5 4. c3 Qb6 {This moves "breaks" my attack on the kingside. I am experimenting now how to face it, and by this moment, Qb3 it is almost the only way to consistently develop the game for white. } 5. Qb3 Nc6 {Black thinks that it's ok to leave the queens on the table, and that an exchange started by him is not the better idea.  Black has to discover that letting the exchange to white is dangerous, too...} 6. Qxb6 axb6 7. Bc7 {Ups... an annoying move for black. I have a good training game with this line...} Bg4 8. Bxb6 {I could have chosen not to let him double my pawns, but... for a bishop? Sure I like it!} Bxf3 9. exf3 cxd4 {Much better for black, I think, would have been c4. Now, in an open position, my bishop pair will be stronger. } 10. cxd4 e5 {Why to open further the game?} 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Bb5+ Nfd7 13. O-O Bd6 14. Nc3 O-O 15. Be3 Nf6 16. Rfd1 Ra5 17. a4 Rd8 {Terrible mistake, I'm sorry for him. Until here, my position was good enough to make Bc7 playable in the opening. From now on, it is only a matter of time. } 18. Bb6 Rxb5 19. axb5 Re8 20. Nxd5 Nxd5 21. Rxd5 Nc4 22. Bc5 Bxc5 23. Rxc5 Nxb2 {No way for black to defend the pawn.} 24. Rc7 h6 25. Rxb7 Nd3 26. g3 Re2 27. Rb8+ Kh7 28. Ra7 f6 29. Rbb7 {}
