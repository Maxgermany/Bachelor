1. e3 {My usual opening. As I lived in Amsterdam, I got attracted to the Amsterdam Opening.} g6 {Kind of tricky. A ''good'' waste of time, my opponnent must be very tricky.  Notice: This is my first game, so beware.} 2. b3 {I wanted to waste time, too. But it was THIS move that brought me bad conditions later on.} Bg7 {HA! Am I blind???????????? No WAY!} 3. c3 {The DP defense.} e5 {A ?! move. What the hell is my opponnent DOING???} 4. d4 {The russian attack. Most aggressive move I saw.} d5 {Another ?! move. Well, I know how sad everything will go next.} 5. f4 {I decided to give my opponnent a chance. Which was dumb.} e4 {Of COURSE! I knew that.} 6. c4 {Oooh boy, blackmail! I offer a pawn trade. Notice that at such an aggressive position 6 moves into the game there hasn't been ANY capture.} Nf6 {Still no capture. A protection of the pawn on d5 and a re-offer of the pawn trade.} 7. cxd5 {Although not the best move, I wanted to get 1st prize for 1st attacker. So: Offer accepted (<Did I spell 'accepted' correct? Please tell me if I spelled it right or not by commenting).} Nxd5 {Duh! Well, the knight is going on offensive. Somehow I am a bit shocked.} 8. Bd2 {I try to protect c3. But I am not doing such a good job.} Nc6 {???? What the hell is going on here!} 9. Bb5 {Surprise #1! PIN! Well, kind of good, but I overlooked. Because now my opponnent does...} O-O {...OH, no he doesn't. He gives me a chance to escape.} 10. Nc3 {But I just go for offensive again.} a6 {NOW's the move. Run for your life, BISHOP!!!} 11. Bc4 {Ok, not run, just move a step.} Qh4+ {Surprise for me! Now I have only one ''good'' choice:} 12. g3 {Pg2-g3. And I almost resigned. I am now so afraid.} Qh3 {A ???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????? move. Why? Ask philostrate.} 13. Nxh3 {Duh! I wonder if my opponnent will resign here... I beg you to comment and rate. Feel free to acces our profiles. I am surprised by the moves as my opponnent was 80 points higher than me at that moment.}
