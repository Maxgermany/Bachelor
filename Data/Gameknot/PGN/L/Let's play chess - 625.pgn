[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {A solid starting move. This controls the center and prepares for an early attack. In my experience, I have difficulty attacking the opponent.  } d5 {This is my counter to 1.d4. This opposes the adjacent pawn and takes control of the center. This move also helps me develop my pieces.} 2. e3 {This is not a common move. This readies up for 3.c4.} Nf6 {I continue to develop, controlling e4.} 3. c4 {This enters the game into the Queen's Gambit. My center control is being pressured.} e6 4. c5 {Not common. This loses all pressure, but blockades my bishop.} b6 5. cxb6 axb6 6. Bb5+ c6 7. Ba4 Ba6 {I am winning a little here.} 8. Bc2 {b} c5 {The point of b6 in many queens pawn games is to push c5 before the opponent pushes e4. } 9. Bd3 c4 {I released tension, but now my black bishop can move farther.} 10. Be2 b5 11. Nf3 Bd6 {Protecting e5.} 12. a4 b4 13. b3 {This was an inaccuracy. I can calmly develop further and not be threatened. I can now castle, free my rook on the a-file, and later cramp his queen side up with c3. Best for him was Ne5 following theory to pressure my initiative.} Ne4 {My mistake. White can trade off and then with Qc2, I cannot attack without giving him time to defend. Better for me was O-O, which at least develops more.} 14. O-O {His mistake. He should have traded pawns.} Qc7 15. g3 f5 16. Nbd2 {His mistake. Better would be moving the other knight there.} Nc3 17. Qe1 Nxe2+ 18. Qxe2 c3 {See the queen and the knight both attacked?} 19. Nc4 {Blunder by him. Better would be Qd1 and be more passive.} dxc4 20. Ne1 {Mistake. Better was Qd1 and be more passive.} cxb3 {And so the game progressed. I won his bishop later with b2 and he resigned.} 21. Qf3 Qc4 22. Nd3 Qxd3 23. Rd1 Qe4 24. Qxe4 fxe4 25. d5 b2 26. Bxb2 cxb2 27. Rab1 Bd3 28. Rxb2 e5 29. Rc1 Kd7 {Here he resigned. In the game, there were examples of bad ideas of attacking and how to manipulate the opponents mistakes.}
