1. e4 {Common opening} e5 {Same} 2. Nf3 {Atack e5 expecting Nc6} Nf6 {Never really faced this actual opening.... hmm wat to do} 3. Bc4 {I'll threaten the f7 pawn} Nxe4 {I figured he'd do that} 4. Nxe5 {threatening Nf7 taking rook} Qf6 {threatening checkmate Qf3 also threatening to take Ne5. Looks like im dead} 5. Qh5 {Looks can be decieving. Queen now protects Knight attacks the f7 pawn and now the king has elbow room to move. Plus more pressure on the f pawn.} Qxf2+ {Check. Nice effort.} 6. Kd1 {Run away!} g6 {Am I supposed to be scared of that?} 7. Bxf7+ {Check} Ke7 {Run away} 8. Bxg6 {Now at first sight you would expect him to take it with the h pawn. But then you realize that then the rook will be completely exposed.  Now that I look back I shouldve taken that pawn with the knight attacking the rook. O well.} d6 {He attacks the knight. } 9. Bxe4 {His knight was being problematic anyway. I might as well trade.} dxe5 {End of transaction} 10. Qxe5+ {Check and attack rook} Kd8 {I thought this move was genius until later i realized my mistake.} 11. Qxh8 {Take rook.} Bg4+ {Almost a checkmate. But i still have my bishop.} 12. Bf3 {defending} Bxf3+ {there goes my bishop} 13. gxf3 {there goes his} Qxf3+ {... $#!%} 14. Ke1 {o well} Qxh1+ {drat a free bishop too} 15. Ke2 {then again if he takes i take his bishop so tats good} Ke7 {... guess he doesnt like that deal} 16. Qe5+ {check} Kd7 {run away} 17. Qf5+ {check} Ke8 {king runs to protect bishop} 18. Nc3 {Knight goes out to protect the bishop with rook} Qxh2+ {Check} 19. Kd1 {run away} Nc6 {developing pieces} 20. Qe4+ {check} Ne5 21. d4 {atacking with pawn} Rd8 {pinning pawn... getting scary} 22. Nd5 {blocking with knight} Kf7 {Making it so that his knight isnt pinned} 23. dxe5 {take free knight. But at the cost of pinning my own.} Bb4 {threatening checkmate... or something rather. He wants me to take it with my queen. So that my knight is undefended. so tat i lose the knight.} 24. c3 {no thanks} c6 {i was afraid of that} 25. Qf5+ {After much thought I realized even though it looks like im about to lose. I have a cool move just watch. Its called foresight} Ke8 {ok if he had gone to the right i couldve forced a free rook. O well. Watch this} 26. Qe6+ {Check} Kf8 {running king} 27. Bh6+ {nice isnt it. Bet someone's cursing} Qxh6 {Queen takes} 28. Qxh6+ {Queen takes. There goes that troublesome queen. and i still check him. This is the life} Ke8 {kingt protects the rook. } 29. cxb4 {I take bishop. Heck eventually my knight's dead. Might as well get a good trade out of it} Rxd5+ {right on cue} 30. Kc2 {but you cant checkmate me with just that. Which he will soon find out} Rxe5 {takes a pawn that had control of the center. But this far in the game thats not really that important.} 31. Rd1 {develop rook} Re2+ {? wat does he plan to accomplish with that} 32. Kc1 {Man hopefully ill be able to move Qh5 but he wont fall for that} Kf7 {...} 33. Qh5+ {I stand corrected} Ke6 {Wow it took him 3 days to think that move up?} 34. Qxe2+ {thank you for the free rook. } Kf5 {finally 3 days passed} 35. Rf1+ {But i got u in conditional move}
