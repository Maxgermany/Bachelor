1. e4 {This is my first annotation here on GK.  This particular game was a lot of fun...  a Kieseritsky gambit, a poisoned pawn, and a pretty checkmate (well, pretty for us  hanging around 1450!)  Enjoy...  As white, I'm a fan of e4.} e5 {Standard reply.} 2. f4 {The King's Gambit leads to many sharp lines.} exf4 {Accepting the gambit is generally considered to be the best reply.} 3. Nf3 g5 {Defending the pawn, but weakening the kingside.} 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5 {And we've arrived at the classic position of the Kieseritsky gambit, where White threatens to win back the lost pawn.} g3 {!?  Interesting.  Black doesn't accept the loss of the pawn, and sends the brave soldier to the sixth rank to put pressure on f2.  I'm going to have to be careful not to allow him to exploit it.} 6. d4 {Taking control of the center, and threatening to win the pawn at f4.} Qe7 {?!  Huh?  I would have expected Black to play ..d6 to drive off the knight, or ..d5 to fight for the center.  Instead he brings out his queen to threaten my knight, which has a defender...} 7. Bxf4 {... and now has two.  I can now win the pawn at g3 at my leisure.} Qb4+ {Ahhhhh!  So THAT'S what her majesty decided to come out and play for!  Black has my b2 pawn caught undefended, and has an eye out for more-- indeed, after Qxb2, my rook is trapped and helpless.  But I had a sense at this point that if Black DID gobble my pawn, I would actually be in a stronger position!} 8. Nc3 {Freeing and defending the rook.  Take a look at the position.  White has 3 pieces out, including a centralized knight, while Black has only the lonely queen out pawn-hunting.  Still, good defense might have salvaged the game, at least for a little while...} Qxb2 {... but instead, Black goes for the undefended b-pawn.  OM NOM NOM NOM} 9. Bd2 {Defends the knight.  I can now win the queen with Nc4!} Qb4 {Qa3 serves the same purpose.  Time for her majesty to get outta Dodge...} 10. Nb5 {!  Ouch.  "Your majesty, you don't look well.  Perhaps it was that poisoned pawn  you ate?"} Qe7 {The only safe square.} 11. Nxc7+ {"Hey, fork you, man!"} Kd8 12. Nxa8 {Mmm, rookalicious.} Nc6 {?  Wait, you're down in material, and you want to offer an exchange that gives me a check?!  Weird... though, I can SORTA see the logic behind it, he attacks d4 and if I did exchange, he would threaten e4...} 13. Bf4 {... so I kill two birds with one stone, and add a defender to each.} d6 {Okay, you REALLY want to exchange, huh?} 14. Nxc6+ bxc6 15. Qd3 {I've got e4 covered, for now, but I haven't castled yet, and I'm feeling a little exposed in the middle.  Still, I probably shouldn't be complaining, given how well everything else is going!} Bb7 {Take back the Knight!} 16. Rb1 {Or maybe not.  (If Bxa8, Rb8 ! and utter nastiness to follow.)} h6 {??  I think Black was (understandably!) in panic mode at this point.  He was afraid of the pin on his queen by Bg5... except, I had no intention of playing that, as it could be parried by f6 or Nf6.  A wasted move.} 17. Be2 {And now my center is freed, with the e4 pawn unpinned!} Bg7 {Better late than never.} 18. e5 {Closing the center and blocking the development of the knight... poor guy has no squares to move to!  And to make matters worse, if.. dxe5, dxe5 with a discovered check!} Kc8 {Still with an eye to reclaim the knight.  But the Black king is just inching closer to doom!} 19. exd6 {Run your majesty, run!} Qd7 {Qd8 was more precise.} 20. Nc7 {Escape!  And Black is now officially screwed.  After this move, I did some analysis and found mate in 6, possibly a couple more if Black used his queen to eliminate an attacker.} Nf6 {At least the knight can finally move.} 21. Rxb7 {!  BOOOOOM!  A battering ram knocks down the front door!} Kxb7 {Virtually forced.} 22. Qa6+ {Defended by TWO pieces (because one is never enough!  Okay, sometimes it is.  Shush.), my queen forces Black's king to b8, where he's trapped!} Kb8 {Now all I have to do is put him in check.} 23. O-O {I knew I'd get around to castling eventually, just didn't think it'd be the second-to-last move of the game!  (If the knight hadn't moved, I'd play Kd2, because of complications arising with Bxd4 , etc.)} Ne8 {Nd5 was his only hope, but it would only be prolonging the inevitable.  (if ..Nd5, 24. Rb1  Nb6 25. Rxb6  axb6 26. Qa8#)} 24. Rb1# {And checkmate!  I hope you were both amused and informed by this annotation... thanks to pstultz for the game!}
