1. e4 {All was played according to theory until some surprising 15.Bf4 but even then the game was easily defensible by black, which had no major undefended weaknesses on his structure... white decided not to take any risks and offered a draw, readily accepted.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O {Main line Nxe4} Nxe4 5. d4 Nd6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 Nf5 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. Nc3 Be6 10. Rd1+ Ke8 11. Ng5 Rd8 {until now all was theory, I now choose an obscure sideline with the idea of getting to a slightly worst endgame but holding it, if white wants more from this game he has to take some risks, and I'll be here to try and profit from them latter on...} 12. Rxd8+ Kxd8 13. Nxe6+ fxe6 14. Ne4 {N, in Rogic Davor (CRO) - Dabo-Peranic Robert (CRO), Croatia, 1992 Bg5 was played the game ended in a draw, with this move white diverged, but I can still transpose in to the game by playing Be7} Be7 15. Bf4 {surprised me! I was expecting either Bg5 or the even more probable Ng5, point being of playing 14.Ne4 instead of 14.Bg5} c5 {defends d4 in case white plays g4, also enters a typical Ruy lopez queen side pawn structure, now b6 will follow soon} 16. Rd1+ {Kc8 is maybe the best reply threatening a pawns storm on the queen's wing} Kc8 17. Bg5 {white forces the exchange due to the threats g4 and Nxc4 next} Bxg5 18. Nxg5 b6 {if Nxe6 I have Re8 wining the e4 pawn... this is a common structure for black's queen side majority, leaves c6 for the knight and defends the c5 pawn} 19. g4 {now I have Nd4} Nd4 {now I expect c3 after which I have a strategic choice to make either  a) Ne2+ with tempo, with the idea Ne2-f4 followed by h6 and g5 to block white's king side pawns and exchange rooks... b) Nc6 with the double point of supporting the queen side pawn majority and threatening e4, forcing white to dispensate some forces to its defense and just a move away from defending e6 and f7 with Nd8} 20. c3 {as expected} Nc6 {I'll go for a more traced path with Nc6} 21. f4 Nd8 {now white will pile up his pawns on the king side, and I'm still to worry about a possible quality exchange Rxd8 that allows white to improve his majority after gaining some more space...} 22. Kf2 {yes, here it is the king is inching to the battle front!} a5 {I counter on the opposed wing as the center is blocked} 23. Nf3 {?! I don't get the point of this move... allows me to solve my problems from now on I should easily hold to a draw, and as expected white needs to take some risk to try and win this game...} Nf7 {my knight won some space and the threat Rxd8 is now off} 24. Ke3 {Rd8, g6 or even h5 are in my thoughts...} g6 {to secure f5, I can still play any of the other moves latter, and even h6 is possible} 25. h4 {again gains more space, and my reply is the same as before on the other wing} a4 26. Ng5 Nxg5 27. hxg5 {I've decide to accept the exchange as now I have the interesting Rf8 that holds all together, if Rh1 I'll play Rf7, plus Rf8 attacks f4 and defends f5 also} Rf8 {aimed at f4 defending f5 and with the idea of Rf7 to defend h7 as well, I'll end up with an overcharged rook, but white can't progress on the other wing either, so if needed I can even bring my king to the king's wing} 28. Rh1 {my opponent proposed a draw which I accepted, as the position is easy to defend from both sides point of view}
