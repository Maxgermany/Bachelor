1. Nf3 c5 2. e4 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 d6 5. Nc3 {c4 is an alternative taking play into a Gurgenidze Accelerated Dragon after g6. Nc3 is fine though expecting a Classical Sicilian} g6 {This is quite an odd move order for the dragon but I couldn't find a punishment of any kind} 6. Be3 Bg7 7. Bc4 Nf6 8. f3 {Bb3 isn't necessary due to the early d6. We are now in a normal dragon as opposed to an accelerated} O-O 9. Qd2 Na5 10. Be2 {This is more precise than the usual Bb3. It looks odd to retreat the bishop but the knight doesn't belong on a5 so it will likely transpose to a more mainstream dragon line after Bd7, Rc8 and Nc4.} Nc6 {A surprising move and not one I particularly rate. The bishop itself may not have gained anything by going to e2 but at least the a1 rook can swing into the attack faster if necessary afetr 0-0-0 so I don't see how Black has gained anything. } 11. O-O-O {A surprising move and not one I particularly rate. The bishop itself may not have gained anything by going to e2 but at least the a1 rook can swing into the attack faster if necessary after 0-0-0 so I don't see how Black has gained anything. } Qa5 {This doesn't seem consistent. The only meaningful idea behind Nc6 I thought was to play into a 0-0-0 rather than a Bc4 dragon with d5 where the loss of tempo may be made slightly relevant by the fact that I'm in an opening less consistent with my repertoire.} 12. Nb3 Qc7 13. h4 {The last two moves have resulted in a transposition to mainline Qa5 dragon with an extra tempo spent on Be2. Now after the main move h5 then g4 will come with more force now thanks to the bishop on e2 and the rook on d1 getting to g1 quickly} Nh5 {This is just a weird move. It's very rare that Black can be thinking about positional movement on the kingside in a dragon without the attack breaking through} 14. g4 Ng3 15. Rh2 Be5 {This move is another strange one to look at. It has a few interesting lines though. The main sequence I looked at was f4, Bxc3, bxc3 (Qxc3, Nxe2, Rxe2, Bxg4) Nxe2, Qxe2, where white does have the doubled pawn weakness but this wont be significant because of the dark square weaknesses in Black's kingside and fact that White's queenside is much more developed.} 16. f4 Nxe2+ 17. Qxe2 Bg7 {This makes Black's position inconsolable. The losses of tempo are quite visible with the four pawns on the kingside compared to Black's immobile a and b pawns.} 18. Nd5 Qd7 19. f5 {Nc5 looks nice but sadly doesn't actually do anything after Qd8} Ne5 20. h5 {The attack now breaks through} gxf5 {not helping matters by opening the g file} 21. gxf5 h6 22. Rg2 {White's threats aren't subtle but they force Black's responses. When you're making defensive moves in the dragon without getting initiative it's a good sign that your position is lost.} Kh7 23. Rdg1 Rg8 {And the finish now is the rather good looking:} 24. f6 exf6 25. Rg2xg7+ {With Rxg7, Nxf6+, Kh8, Rxg7, Kxg7, Nxd7, Bxd7, Bd4 being game over. Sorry about a lack of analysis in this game, it was more based on opening themes than concrete variations as the attacking moves are quite easy to find and the position sort of plays itself}
