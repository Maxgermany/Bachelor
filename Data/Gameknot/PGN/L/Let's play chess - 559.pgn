1. e4 {Another game of mine. 1.e4!} e5 2. Nf3 {So...fried liver attack?} d5 {Perhaps not.} 3. exd5 {I gave up the center.} Bg4 {A pin, not so nice.} 4. Be2 {Let's break it.} Bxf3 5. Bxf3 {Thx, i like the bishops more.} Qf6 {Another guy who likes to swing his queen around, well... } 6. d6 {A little trap, which may cost him 3p of material.(considering that i loose my light-squared bishop after)} Nd7 {He saw it, now i can keep my advantage.} 7. dxc7 {There you go!} Rc8 {Another pawn?} 8. Bxb7 Rxc7 9. Be4 {Fine placement for the bishop.} Bc5 {Mate in 1, I won't fall for that.} 10. O-O Nh6 11. Nc3 {Just development.} Ng4 {Stupid?} 12. Qxg4 g6 {What is it's purpose?} 13. Nd5 {FORK!!!} Qd6 14. Nxc7+ {Sweet rook.} Qxc7 15. c3 {With thoughts of b4} Nf6 {Fork for him, well... I am up on material.} 16. Qf3 Nxe4 17. Qxe4 {And now i am ready for b4.} O-O 18. b4 {There you go, kinda late but...} Bd6 19. a4 {4pawns vs 1 pawn, who will win?} Re8 {Maybe with thoughts of opening up the e file.} 20. Re1 {Let's double then.} Re6 {Developing the rook, but now...} 21. Qa8+ {CHECK!, checking is good it wins tempo and sometimes pinned pieces.} Bf8 22. Bb2 {Preparing d4 and connecting the 2 rooks.} h5 {Weakening or expanding, I really don't know.} 23. d4 {Forcing some exchanges. } f5 24. Qd5 {But I saw something nice, a pin and three attackers on e5, I think he will play bg7 because he played like a moron till now, he can't defend both his rook and his pawn.      I really like this game and I want to get better, just tell me what you think and what I've missed.      Thanks for the comments in the previous game BTW, hope you enjoy this one too.                                                                                          (Still in progress *)                  } Qe7 {So I didn't expect that, queen was already protecting the e pawn.} 25. dxe5 {Another pawn plus, isn't that nice?} Kh7 {Walking out of the pin.} 26. Rad1 {Doubling with thoughts of exchanging the queens.} Bg7 {Attacking the pawn, that isn't an issue, let's force the exchange.} 27. Qd7 Bxe5 {He captured as I was sure he would.} 28. Qxe7+ {Exchange.} Rxe7 29. c4 {And now bullet throw the heart, he's next move should be bf6 or bd6 or he is loosing the rook.} Bxb2 30. Rxe7+ {And no he resigned, and for sure reasons, he will lose another pawn and I will be 10+, good game for him.}
