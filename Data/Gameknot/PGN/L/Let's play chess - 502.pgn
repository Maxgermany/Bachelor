[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 {This is the London System, which is extremely popular on GameKnot right now. White's setup is very solid, but there are plenty of opportunities to get aggressive at c7 or at the Kingside.} e6 4. a3 {?! This is unnecessarily slow. Rather than preventing just one of Black's many options for development, White should focus on activating his own pieces — either Nf3 or e3.  Black usually won't want to play …Bb4 in this opening anyway (unless White plays some silly weakening move like b3) because the trade …Bxc3+ just helps White — pair of Bishops, c3-pawn supports the center, open b-file, etc.  White does make the correct decision to avoid Nb5, which is just a waste of time after …Na6.} c5 {! The most aggressive approach to White's slow opening play.} 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Nf3 Nh5 7. Ne5 {This move is OK (the DSB is White's bad Bishop and the doubled f-pawns just help control the center), but I would have considered either Bg5 or Bd3 (why move the Knight twice when the LSB is still waiting?) instead. In particular, Bg5 makes the Knight just look stupid. (…f6?! 8. Bh4 g5? 9. Nxg5!)} Nxf4 8. exf4 cxd4 9. Qxd4 Bc5 10. Qd2 a6 11. Bd3 Nxe5 12. fxe5 Bd7 13. f4 {!? At first, I didn't like this move. The Kingside is weakened and 0-0 is now impossible. But, seeing as White plans to castle Queenside and launch a pawn storm anyways, I now think that this move is fine, if very committal.} O-O 14. h4 Bc6 15. h5 h6 16. O-O-O {! Knife's-edge timing. White castles at the very last moment before it would get dangerous not to, meaning that Black has to wait until now before truly beginning a counter-attack. This feel for when to make "safe" moves and when to push it is absolutely essential if you want to play in an aggressive style, like White does in this game.} a5 {? The wrong pawn. Just pushing pawns does not an attack make — you've got to try and open lines of attack (with pawn breaks, for example). …b5 would instead threaten …b4 to aim at the a-pawn and guarantee Black a half-open file on the Queenside.} 17. g4 {! Now, in contrast, White takes direct aim at the immobile target on h6, guaranteeing that things get opened up.  (Note that …e5 is met adequately by Ne4.)} Be7 {? This move goes completely against the needs of the position. Black cannot win by defending — sooner or later, White's attack WILL get through. Black needs to use this time to counter-attack on the Queenside. Even if Black can't mate first, s/he may be able to trade off/tie down some White pieces to defence to weaken White's attack.} 18. Rdg1 {White wants blood and will not be denied!} f6 {?! Interesting. Black takes aim at White's center — if that was his/her plan, why wait until now? — which does blunt White's attack somewhat but also leaves some serious Kingside weaknesses behind.} 19. exf6 {My first impulse was to want to maintain the pawn on e5 (with Qe2, say), but now I think White's attack is strong enough that this move is correct. Black never has time to get things going in the center, and White's pawns are free to keep storming.} Bxf6 20. g5 hxg5 21. fxg5 Bd4 22. Rge1 {Other Rook moves may be better — Rg4 or Rg2 come to mind — but this move is perfectly adequate. Bh7+ is tempting but I would hate to part with such a lovely attacking piece.} Rf2 23. Re2 Rxe2 24. Nxe2 Be5 25. h6 {And now, the Black King's cover is stripped away.} d4 {This discovery has been available for many moves now, but it's never been a real threat. It still isn't.} 26. Rf1 {I wish there was a way to keep the Rook on the h-file, but I don't see a good square for it where it isn't open to harassment from the Bishops. Maybe h4 — but then the pin on the g-pawn is unpleasant.  The f-file is the next best spot for the Rook.} Qd6 27. Nf4 {This move is probably necessary, but I'd play hxg7! first, opening the h-file for more attacking, and wait to see what Black does.} Bxf4 28. Rxf4 e5 {Now Black's center is starting to look a bit menacing.} 29. Rf1 {?! Now, though, Rh4 is definitely called for — it prepares for attack on the h-file (did you all catch that the h-file is important yet?), prevents …e4, and avoids further exchanges after …Rf8.} a4 {? This move has nothing to do with the needs of the position. If Black wants to move a Queenside pawn, s/he should play …b5 and then …b4. Otherwise, …Bd5, preparing …e4, looks good to me.} 30. Qf2 {This is a good attacking move, and difficult to meet (…Rf8? h7+!) BUT… when are you going to play hxg7!!!!!!???????} Bd5 31. Qf5 {Nice — this is a better move here than hxg7, by the way — now White is clearly better.} e4 {What else?} 32. Bxe4 Bxe4 33. h7+ {?? NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!  NEVER close lines where you're trying to attack.  White should actually still win (an extra pawn makes up for a lot), so the question marks are not really deserved. Still, with one move, White basically gives up any chance of attacking the Black King for no reason at all. Note that, after 33. Qxe4, White couldn't /pay/ Black to take on h6 — …gxh6 34. gxh6 Qxh6 35. Rg1+ is suicide.} Kh8 34. Qxe4 Rf8 35. Rxf8+ Qxf8 36. g6 {? Again, why close lines around the enemy King? Qxd4 is a much nicer way to maintain a pawn advantage, since …Kxh7 just exposes Black's King. Now, Black does a great job exploiting the stalemating possibilities afforded him/her by White's own misguided pawns.} Qf1+ 37. Kd2 Qf2+ 38. Kd3 {! Instead of ducking for cover, the White King bravely ventures out to snatch pawns. Why not? — there's no risk of mate.} Qg3+ 39. Kxd4 Qg1+ 40. Kc4 Qf1+ 41. Kb4 Qf8+ 42. Kxa4 Qa8+ 43. Kb3 Qc8 {Black's checks have only managed to lose 2 more pawns… but they have brought the position much closer to stalemate, which is the only escape left for Black.} 44. Kb4 {I'm not sure what this move is trying to accomplish. Instead, Qd5 looks like a sure win — White will force a Queen trade with Qg8+, sacrificing a pawn to rule out stalemate, and then just push the Queenside pawns. Of course, to see that, you have to see the very real risk of stalemate, which is far from obvious. I'd like to think that I would see this in the heat of a real game, but I'm not sure I would.} b6 {Coyly inviting White to snatch the b-pawn — it's a threat, right?} 45. c4 Qf8+ 46. Kc3 b5 {And now the draw is all but assured. Well played to Black.} 47. b4 {! Good, keeping a sliver of winning chances alive.} Qf6+ 48. Kb3 bxc4+ {With check, now!} 49. Qxc4 {At least White now has Qg8+ if Black misses the stalemate. White can delay taking the pawn for longer, but Black can force the issue with a few checks.} Qf3+ {Aw, c'mon. …Qb2+!! would have ended the game faster, and in much greater style. (Ka4 Qxb4+!)} 50. Qc3 {I assume that White saw the stalemate, but couldn't see a way out of the checks. Good game to both players.} Qxc3+ 51. Kxc3 {}
