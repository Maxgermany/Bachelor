1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 b6 3. Nc3 Bb7 {I've been experimenting with this fianchetto defense for Black.  Sometimes it results in a cramped position, but often results in interesting play.} 4. Bg5 Be7 5. Qd3 {The chess teacher Dan Heisman often talks about counting as an important concept in elementary tactics.  With Qd3, Black missed that the Bishop on g5 is attacked twice (B and Q behind it) and only protected once (N), and therefore isn't safe.} Bxg5 6. Ne4 Be7 {White gains a tempo and has better development, but is down a full piece.} 7. e3 d5 8. Nc3 Nf6 9. O-O-O Ne4 {The N threatens to capture on f2, forking the Rs and Q.  If White plays Nxe4, dxe4 forks the N and Q.} 10. Nxe4 dxe4 11. Qb5+ {White cleverly tries to get out of the pawn fork with a check to gain a tempo, but forgets that the Q can still be attacked with c6 or Bc6.} Bc6 12. Qh5 exf3 13. gxf3 Qd5 {With a significant material plus, Black offers a Q exchange, while also threatening to fork the Rs with Qxf3.} 14. Qh3 Qxf3 15. Rd3 {Either Qxh3 or Qxh1 are possible here.  Black chooses to remove as much material as possible from the board, which usually makes an existing material advantage more telling.} Qxh3 16. Bxh3 Bxh1 {Black is poorly developed, but is up two minor pieces and a R.  Once the position is consolidated, it should be easily won.} 17. Rc3 Na6 18. d5 Bxd5 {White may have forgotten about the B lurking on h1.} 19. f4 {White resigned after moving.  Black can castle and then use the large material advantage to grind White down.}
