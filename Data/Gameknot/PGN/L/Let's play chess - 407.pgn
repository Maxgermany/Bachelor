1. d4 e5 2. d5 Nf6 3. c4 {Protecting the spearhead at d5.} Bb4+ 4. Bd2 Bxd2+ 5. Nxd2 {White is preparing e4 to support the big centre.} Qe7 6. e4 c6 7. Ngf3 {White develops his pieces.} Na6 8. Be2 Nc5 9. Qc2 h6 {I wonder about 9 a5 to try to preserve the knight outpost at c5.} 10. b4 {Attacking the knight at c5.} Na6 11. a3 {Protecting the pawn at b4.} d6 12. Qa4 {Probably premature. White should have preferred castles but was I worried about g5 making sense of blacks ninth move 9 h6?} Bd7 {White saw 13 dc Bxc6 14 b5 but black has Bd7 and the pawn is pinned to whites queen.} 13. Qc2 {The queen excursion was premature due to the above note.} Rc8 {This threatens a double capture against the pinned queen.} 14. Qb2 {Moving out of the pin and the threat.} Nh5 {Aiming for f4.} 15. Nxe5 {Trying to win a pawn.} Nf4 16. Nxd7 Nxe2 17. Qxg7 Kxd7 18. Qg4+ Kc7 19. Qxe2 {Whites manoeuvres have netted two pawns and the king can still castle.} Rce8 {I would prefer a rook on the g file aiming to deter white from kingside castling.} 20. O-O {Castling connects the two rooks and hopefully makes the king safe.} Nb8 21. a4 Nd7 22. dxc6 {Trying to get at the black king.} bxc6 23. b5 {Trying to bare the king.} f5 {Pressure is added to e4.} 24. bxc6 {Trying to removes blacks defenders.} Nc5 {A good outpost for the knight.} 25. Rfb1 {Both rooks are needed on the queen side where the black king is located.} Kxc6 {Not fatal but 25 Reb8 is preferable contesting the b file.25 Nxe4 is losing because of Rb7+ winning the queen.} 26. Nb3 Nxe4 {A terrible move which loses immediately.} 27. Na5+ {Black resigns. One way is mate. The other loses the queen.}
