1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {? Bowlder Attack. Rather weak, but popular among less booked players as it seems good. But it allows Black to take the center with tempo when he plays d5.} e6 3. Nc3 Nc6 {Nf6 inorder to play d5 was better.} 4. Nf3 {I like d3 more inorder to play Bg5 after 4...Nf6} Nf6 5. d4 cxd4 {d5 was much better, this allows a transposition into a more normal Sicilian (Looks like the Four Knight where white played Bc4 instead of Ndb5)} 6. Nxd4 Bb4 {even after the captures in the center, d5 still looks good, desptie the isoltated d pawn, Ne5 also looks better than Bb4.} 7. Ndb5 {Clever and agressive, and possibly consistent. But simply castling seems safer.} a6 {Nxe4 and d5 (yes d5 again, the center is the most important part of the board) both are better.} 8. Nd6+ Ke7 9. e5 {? Bad on a count of Nxe5} Ne8 {? Bad on a count of not being Nxe5} 10. Bg5+ f6 11. Qf3 {??Loses a piece after Nxe5 Nxc8  Qxc8 or Bxd6 exd6 Nxd6 with a duble attack on the 2 bishops.  } Bxd6 {One way to win a piece} 12. exd6+ Nxd6 13. Nd5+ {?? Looks to me to just lose another piece because afterExd5 there is still a double attack on the bioshops.} Kf7 {I prefer the simplest method, of just taking the knight and then a bishop.} 14. Bf4 {I like Nxf6 more because it atleast gets a pawn for the piece as opposed to nothing} Nxc4 15. O-O-O {?? looks good as the knight cant be taken right now (exd5 Qxd5  and white wins a knight. but after N6e5 Bxe5 Nxe5 both queen and knight are attacked and white loses another piece.} e5 {? N6e5 is better.} 16. Qb3 {?? Weak because of N6a5 with another, yes you guessed it, DOUBLE ATTACK!!} Nc4a5 {just as good as N6a5} 17. Qb6 {A nice try} Qxb6 {??Simpler is exf4 which just wins another piece without worrying about complications like the knight attacking the rook.} 18. Nxb6 Ra7 {Rb8 to avoid revealed attacks was better. This allows white to win material after Be3. Actually taking the Bishop was probably better, it would give back a bit of material to halt White's attack. exf5 19. Nxa8 Nc4 (to stop Nb6) 20. b3 Ne5 21. Nb6 and the bishop will fall but the pawn looks strong for now.} 19. Be3 Nd4 {Trying to block everything with his knight (Bishop's diagonal and the rook's file). } 20. c3 {! very good, beats winning the pawn by capturing the knight.} Nf5 {Not a good move, Nb5 was better} 21. Nxc8 {! } Nxe3 {of course not Rxc8 Bxa7} 22. Rxd7+ {The beginning of the end.} Ke6 23. Rd6+ {Re7  is a bit better because it maintains a rook on the 7th rank.} Kf7 24. Nxa7 Nxg2 {?  Allowing white to use the g file.} 25. Rg1 Nc4 {Postpones moving the knight followed by Rd7  and Rxg7} 26. Rd7+ Ke6 27. Rxb7 {And we see the flaw in Nxg2.} Nf4 28. Rgxg7 Kf5 29. Nc6 {Bringing the knight back into the game.} Ng6 30. Rgxh7 {Trading into an easily winning endgame.} Rxh7 31. Rxh7 Kg5 32. Ne7 Nxe7 33. Rxe7 {Black resigns, he hasn't got a chance.}
