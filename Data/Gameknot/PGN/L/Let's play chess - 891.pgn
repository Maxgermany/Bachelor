1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 {I think 2...e6 is the strongest defence with 2...c5.} 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 {I didn't expect this move, even if it's played by many players.} 5. e4 {e4 or Nf3...} Nxc3 6. bxc3 Be7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. Bc4 b6 9. O-O Bb7 10. Qc2 {Qc2, starting to have a look at the castled king...} Nd7 11. Re1 c5 12. Bf4 {Bf4, knowing that if black take white pawn, I can take it quietly.} cxd4 13. Rad1 Rc8 14. Rxd4 Bc5 15. Rd3 Qe7 16. Qa4 Nf6 17. Bb5 Rfd8 {Middle game is becoming interesting.} 18. Rxd8+ Rxd8 19. h3 a6 20. Bf1 b5 21. Qc2 Rc8 22. a4 e5 {e5?} 23. Bxe5 b4 24. c4 Rd8 25. Bd3 a5 26. Bf4 Nh5 27. Bh2 Bd6 28. e5 {e5 to close that dangerous diagonal.} Bxf3 29. Re3 {Re3! Good move by white.} Bc7 30. Bxh7+ Kf8 31. Rxf3 Bxe5 32. c5 {c5?! Maybe Bxe5 was a little better...} Bxh2+ 33. Kxh2 Rc8 34. Qb2 {Qb2?!} Rxc5 35. Bd3 Nf6 36. Re3 Qd7 37. f4 Qxa4 38. Qd4 Rd5 39. Qc4 {Well....White has made some dubious moves and Qc4 is dubious as well...I see Qa6 a little better.} Qd7 40. Bc2 g6 {g6? I don't understand this move. The protection of the knight is almost all on g pawn...} 41. Bb3 Rd4 42. Qa6 Qd6 43. Qc8+ {White wants to "frame" the opponent...} Qd8 44. Qb7 Rd7 45. Qc6 Nd5 46. Rd3 Nb6 47. Rxd7 Nxd7 {Exchanges.} 48. Qd5 Qe7 49. Qxa5 Qd6 50. Qa8+ Kg7 51. Qe4 g5 52. g3 gxf4 53. gxf4 Qd2+ 54. Kg3 {I couldn't risk to have a too-far-king from the centre of the board.} Qc3+ 55. Qf3 Qxf3+ 56. Kxf3 Nc5 {....White should lose the bishop...} 57. Bc2 b3 58. Bf5 b2 59. Ke3 Ne6 60. Be4 Nc7 61. h4 Nb5 {Knight's tour!} 62. Bd3 Na3 63. Kf3 {Now, for what I think, white can't win or draw the game; I believe that black should checkmate white in 15 or 20 moves...But I try to do the crafty, offering a draw 'cause maybe the opponent believes it's gonna be a draw....And he accepted. I didn't wanna to be unfair, believe me, I was waiting for a chance...That's it. Let me know what your opinions are.}
