1. c4 {I won this game with a bishop sac on the kingside and a devastating fork.  I begin with the English Opening trying to get my opponent into unfamiliar lines.} e5 {This is the King's English} 2. g3 {Preparing to fianchetto my bishop to take advantage of the light squares in the center.} Nc6 3. Nc3 {I delay fianchetto to develop my c knight and prevent e4} Bc5 {It is fairly common in the King's English to attack the f2 square early.} 4. Bg2 {Now I have control of d5.} Nf6 {He develops his knight} 5. Nf3 {I develop my f knight for castling. I am not worried about e4 here because Ng5 wins the e4 pawn.} d5 {I have lost control of d5 with the knight move and he takes advantage of this} 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. d3 {Preparing for e4 and attacking the centralized knight.} O-O 8. O-O Be6 {black tries to hold on to d5 with this move, now all of his minor pieces are developed.} 9. Ng5 {attacking the bishop and threatening to double up his pawns on the e file} Nde7 {dont understand this move.} 10. Nxe6 {I take the bishop and double up his pawns on the e-file.} fxe6 11. Bg5 {I develop my dsb and pin his knight to his queen} Rf7 {Better to move the queen than make a risky move with taking the rook off the back rank.} 12. e3 {taking pressure off of f2} h6 {He attacks my bishop and as you can see on the next move I sac it to blow away his kingside.  I know by analysing that I will get equal compensation for the bishop back.} 13. Bxh6 {The bishop sac which defined the character of this game.} gxh6 14. Qg4+ {I immediately exploit his destroyed kingside and win compensation for the bishop.} Rg7 15. Qxe6+ {He forgot about his pawn on e6.} Kh8 16. Qxh6+ {Now we are equal in material and Ive destroyed his kingside, ive just got to get more pieces into the attack.} Rh7 17. Qf6+ Kg8 18. Ne4 {I get my knight into play attacking his bishop while joining the Queen in the attack.} Bb6 19. Ng5 {Attacking his rook now he cant use it to attack my queen.} Rg7 20. Qe6+ Kf8 21. Qf6+ Kg8 {I need another piece in the attack so I decide to use my fianchettoed bishop} 22. Be4 Kh8 {black should not be worried by 23. Bh7+ because RxB NxR KxR and things are evened out.  Instead he makes a whale of a blunder with Kh8 as I fork the Queen and the King} 23. Nf7+ {Black resigned here.}
