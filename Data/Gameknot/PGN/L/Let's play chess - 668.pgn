[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {It's a very common and very easy to be developed through so many variations. Play as white, I usually start with 1. e2 e4 and hope black doesn't perform Sicilian Defense, I hate that ...} e5 {A common and a quite good response to 1. e2 e4 ...} 2. Nf3 {Initiating an attack to black's pawn, I move the knight to f3... (King's Knight Opening, C40)} d6 {Black move his pawn to d6, starting a strong Philidor's Defence, but here come a new problem. It's very hard to develop his king's bishop...} 3. Nc3 {Actually an usual response to break Philidor's Defence is moving white pawn to d4, but I want to try something new: moving queen's knight to c3. } Bg4 {3. ....... Bg4? I don't know why black move the bishop to g4, it's very weak... Actually Nc6 is better.. But as long it doesn't threat my king, I let it stand here.} 4. Bc4 {I move my bishop to c4 to prepare castling, a very common idea for beginner like me.} h6 {Black move his pawn to h6, maybe he want to stop my knight's movements. Here I see a very good chance to attack black... A queen sacrifice! } 5. Nxe5 {5. Nxe5!? I think it's the most interesting move in this game. Giving my queen to black!  } Bxd1 {Actually black must think it deeply, because I won't give my queen without any reasons. But, maybe he thought that I make an error or because I am still beginner (the last is right!)  ANALYSIS= How if black refuse my queen and take my knight at e5? There's no problem. I'll take the g4 bishop and performing a well developed position.} 6. Bxf7+ {My bishop do a starting check 6. Bxf7+ !!  The king has no choices. He just can move to e7 since d7 is guarded by my knight.} Ke7 {And a very beautiful checkmate that can't be avoided since 5. ..... Bxd1 ?? } 7. Nd5# {}
