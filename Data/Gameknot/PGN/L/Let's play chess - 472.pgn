1. e4 {Random game challenge taken up by a higher ranked player.} d5 {I decided to go for the Scandinavian as I have had some success with this especially against higher ranked players} 2. e5 Bf5 3. d4 c5 {Trying to break up his centre pawns} 4. Be3 {he is having none of it} c4 {So I decide to block in his lsb for now} 5. Nc3 g6 6. Bg5 Bg7 7. h3 {I don't understand this move, perhaps its a waiting move} Qb6 {Threatening the b2 pawn and eyeing up the d4 pawn} 8. b3 f6 9. exf6 Nxf6 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 {More pressure on d4.  Although my kingside is looking a little draughty I am thinking about castling there} 11. Nxd5 {Loses material} Qa5+ 12. c3 {Whites queenside is looking even more exposed than my kingside and he can't castle on his kingside for a good few moves yet} Qxd5 13. bxc4 Qe4+ {Staying on the h1 a8 diagonal so that white can't get his lsb out yet} 14. Qe2 Nd7 {I'm under no pressure to exchange so I proceed with my development, to me black looks sligtly better but not really in a position to take advantage} 15. Nf3 Nc5 {The knight is immune to the d4 pawn due to dxc5, Bxc3+ winning a rook} 16. Qxe4 Nxe4 17. Rc1 Rc8 18. Be2 Ng5 19. O-O Be4 20. Ne5 Nf7 21. Nxf7 Kxf7 22. c5 a6 23. Rfe1 Bd5 {limiting whites options for his lsb} 24. a3 Rhd8 25. Bg4 Rc7 26. Rc2 Bc4 27. Be2 Bb3 28. Rb2 Ba4 29. Rb4 Bc6 30. Bc4+ Bd5 31. Bxd5+ Rxd5 32. Rb6 Rcd7 33. Reb1 {At this point I was thinking of some sort of bishop sacrifice to gain a couple of pawns e.g. Bxd4,cxd4 then I realised that if I could get my bishop onto the h2b8 diagonal there was the  threat of a back row mate} e5 34. Rb6xb7 exd4 35. cxd4 Rd5xd4 36. c6 Rxb7 37. Rxb7+ {I had calculated that white would find it tough to promote his newly passed pawn} Ke8 38. Rb8+ Ke7 39. f4 {preventing Be5 and also opening another escape route for his king  At this point I was starting to think I had seriously miscalculated} Bh4 40. c7 Bg3 {Prevents white from promoting due to the threat of mate} 41. Kf1 {Pretty much the only option} Rxf4+ 42. Ke2 {I think this is a mistake, I was worried about Kg1 for which I could see no effective answer.} Rf2+ 43. Ke3 Bxc7 44. Re8+ {I am more than happy to exchange due to my material advantage} Kxe8 45. Kxf2 h5 46. Ke3 Kd7 {White resigned. Though I am not entirely sure that he couldn't have got a draw.  For me this was an enjoyable game with a few mistakes on both sides. Please comment}
