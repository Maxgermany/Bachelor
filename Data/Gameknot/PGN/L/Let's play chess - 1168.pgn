[Opening "English (A34), symmetrical, three knights system"]

1. c4 {English Opening.} c5 {Trying to go into a symetrical english.} 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 d5 4. h3 {The last few moves were main line. However cxd5 Nxd5 g3 is more common than h3. Play would continue: 4:cxd5 Nxd5 5:g3 Nc7 with black building up a big centre with f6 and e5 and white trying to exert pressure with his bishop on g2 and knights.} d4 {Taking on c4 looks ok but white can regain the pawn with Qa4  or even d3 and Bxc4.} 5. Nb5 Nc6 6. d3 e5 {Black can look forward to a good game because of his central control.} 7. Bg5 Be7 8. g3 O-O 9. Bg2 Be6 {Finishing development.} 10. Nh2 Qd7 11. g4 Rab8 {Threatening a quennside pawn push with a6 and b5.} 12. O-O a6 13. Na3 b5 14. b3 b4 {I closed the queenside as I thought I had better prospects of a kingside attack.} 15. Nb1 h6 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 17. Nd2 Be7 18. Ne4 h5 {Maybe f5 was better as it was a little less loosening.} 19. f4 {White attempts to seize the initiative with this move.} hxg4 20. hxg4 Bxg4 21. Nxg4 Qxg4 22. f5 {This threatens f6 opening up the kingside.} Bg5 {I think f6 was better as it dosnt allow f6 which proves awkward for black.} 23. Rf3 Bf4 {Stopping Rg3.} 24. f6 {This pawn becomes a thorn in blacks side.} g6 25. Nxc5 {Material is now level, and I would say that white has an edge.} e4 {I felt if I didnt take some positive action that I would be pushed back and suffocated.This opens e5 for my knight.} 26. Nxe4 Ne5 27. Rh3 Be3+ {This may have been a mistake and I think I should have left this square for the knight. Maybe Qf5 to be followed by Ng4-e3. The knight is a short range piece and needs to be closer to the action than the bishop.} 28. Kh1 {After this white looks fine and a clear pawn up} Rb6 {I was running out of ideas here and I was surprised when my draw offer was accepted. White has a strong knight on e4 that I cant move, a few open files towards my king with attacking prospects and an extra pawn which shouldn't be too hard to win.}
