1. e4 {Certainly no Grandmaster game; but this as an example for the fighting spirit....it ain`t over till it`s over..^^} c5 {I `m the sicilian type o guy. I mean this one black move symbolizes s.th.(among other non-central replies for Black of course) Like James Brown sung in his famous song "Chess machine" :" Don`t worry `bout his `cause i got mine." ;)...Black doesn`t attack the white pawn. It`s been noticed though. But Black does his own thang.} 2. f4 Nc6 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nc3 g6 5. Bb5 Bd7 {nothing exceptional so far, though im not sure if the fianchetto is correct with the white Pawn on f4.} 6. O-O Bg7 7. d3 Nf6 8. Qe1 O-O 9. Qh4 e6 10. e5 dxe5 11. fxe5 Nd5 12. Bg5 Qc7 13. Bh6 Nxe5 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 15. Nxe5 Bxb5 16. Ng4 Bc6 17. Ne4 {obviously strong} f5 {no way out of the threat on f6} 18. Ng5 {here we go..} Kg8 19. Nh6+ Kh8 20. Nxe6 Qe5 21. Nxf8 Rxf8 {that train was not to stop..} 22. Rae1 Qxb2 {but white has no substantial attack which black couldn`t parade} 23. g4 {invitation to jump off the roof by f5xg4 ? i don`t think so..} Qd4+ {the end of white`s attack, now black takes control and the quality advantage won`t help} 24. Qf2 Qg7 {no exchange of course, there will be another weak spot..} 25. c4 Nf6 26. g5 Nd7 27. h4 Ne5 {now it is getting interesting, the counterattack is rolling...lil threat here, lil threat there..} 28. Red1 Ba4 29. Rd2 b6 30. d4 Nxc4 31. Rd3 Nd6 {confusion works^^} 32. dxc5 Ne4 {hellou kitty} 33. Qh2 {i really just wanted to say hello..;) !} Bb5 {the question of quality has been equalized now.} 34. Qe2 {?ur not serious, that wouldn`t have been necessary...} Ng3 {nice, ah ? sweet little package made of nothing but one Knight and one Bishop embracing the complete white court ^^} 35. Qd2 {take one rook? why not, but taking both of them is much more fun!} Nxf1 {this one first of course..the King will pin the second rook} 36. Kxf1 Rd8 {the end of white`s planless steam of joy after some material gain..} 37. Kf2 Rxd3 38. Qb4 bxc5 39. Qxb5 Qd4+ {no need for the bishop any more...that`s it, the rest is silent death in the backyard, both white Knight and Queen cut off...} 40. Ke1 Qe3+ 41. Kf1 Rd1+ 42. Kg2 Rg1+ {How they say? U better kill me when u attack me..^^I like the game for the double rook sack at the end; won many games like that with material loss as incentive...strategic sacrifice..? never heard...Never give up! Unless ur totally screwed..}
