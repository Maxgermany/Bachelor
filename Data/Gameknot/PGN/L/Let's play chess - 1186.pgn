1. e4 {I play terribly in this game, I was ashamed of myself until the last move, then I felt fine.} e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 3. Nc3 a6 4. d4 Bd6 5. dxe5 Bxe5 6. Nxe5 Qxe5 7. Qd5 d6 8. f4 Qxd5 9. exd5 Bf5 10.

Kg5 f3 62. a5 Rxa5+ {Now that I am 19 points down, it is time to resign. With a rook and a queen in play he should force mate within a few moves. But watch carefully and learn what NOT to do when you have a big advantage.} 63. Kg6 Qg4+ 64. Kf7 Rf5+ 65. Ke6 Nc5+ 66. Ke7 Qg5+ 67. Ke8 Re5+ 68. Kf7 Re7+ 69. Kf8 {Nd7  , Ne6  , Qg7   All those moves will mate me. Which one will he pick?} f2 {He goes for another queen when he doesn't need it. A classic draw. The funny factor in this game is that from move 62 to 68 he kept checking me, yet here when he had the kill shot available he did not take it. Learn from this.}
