1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Bb3 {This move is a little out of place. It gives black the initiative.} O-O {I just take time out to castle.} 6. Nxe5 {!? Maybe not the sharpest.} Bxf2+ {I learned this move not long ago.} 7. Kxf2 Nxe5 {Material is even and his king moved. Looking good...} 8. Rf1 Nfg4+ {!? This allows him to artificially castle.} 9. Kg1 Qh4 {Can't lose the initiative...} 10. h3 {The only move.} d6 11. Qe1 {Taking on g4 with the pawn would lose the queen after Nxg4 and white must give up his queen to prevent mate.} Qxe1 {No other options...} 12. Rxe1 Nf6 {Wish there was a better square for the knight.} 13. d4 Nc6 14. Be3 Re8 15. Bf2 Na5 {I didn't have many other options. I am losing.} 16. Re3 c6 17. Rae1 Nxb3 {I trade off my bad knight.} 18. axb3 Nd7 19. Bg3 Re6 {Here I missed c5! and I get myself out of the bind.} 20. e5 c5 {A little late...} 21. d5 {Ouch!} Rg6 22. e6 {? Better to just take the pawn.} fxe6 23. Re3xe6 {?? This allows material equality.} Nf6 {!! I do find these moves every once in a while...} 24. Re6e8+ {?? This loses.} Nxe8 25. Rxe8+ Kf7 26. Rd8 Rxg3 27. Rxd6 Bxh3 {I am up a rook. He resigned.}
