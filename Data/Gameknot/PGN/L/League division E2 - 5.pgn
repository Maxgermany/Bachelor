1. e4 {~ Always 1. e4 ... 2. f4 ... 3. Nf3 ... (gambits by nature are not fundamentally sound, but when I saw someone using it against me in Afghanistan I fell for the novelty of it! Lively play and it can be beaten.)} e5 { 1. ... e5 (the most popular response)} 2. f4 {~ Will he accept? It's too tempting! Also available is the gambit declined and the gambit accepted.} d6 {~ Be advised: Bishops before Knights is a no-no! The c8-g3 diagonal open but easily dismissed.} 3. fxe5 {~  I've decided not concede his Bishop pin on my Knight. This could have been a disastrous decision if he would have caught it (3. ... Qh4+ 4. g2 Qxe4 5. Be2 Qxh1 followed by more self-inlflicted wounds)} dxe5 {~ Advantage declined by Black!} 4. Nf3 {~ Breathing easier now. An experienced player would not have lost to me.} Bd6 {~ It would be much better to guard the King's pawn with 4. ... Nc6 (Bishops should be attacking!)} 5. Bc4 {~ I'm cooking up some fried liver. The f7 pawn is on the grill!} Nf6 {~ "Stop kidding yourself. It's too late to Castle Kingside!"} 6. Bxf7+ {~ Should the King capture? Or just get out of the way!} Kxf7 {~ Again, the bait is taken!} 7. Ng5+ {~ Black is not in bad shape. Not until a fatal decision in the next move.} Kg6 {~ Heaps of trouble in front of your own pawns. Don't play in the traffic if you're the King!} 8. h4 {~ Hunting my Knight would be much easier for the pawns.} Bg4 {~ Threatening my Queen won't work. There is no safe place to hide for Black.} 9. h5+ {~ who would have thought the most important pawns on the Board were at d2, e4, and h5? 8. ... h5 would have prevented this Check!} Kxg5 {~ Does it look hopeless for the Queen? No!} 10. d4# {~ With Black's Queen and Knight sitting on the Back Rank, the King learns a painful lesson in development. Match Over, 1-0 !}
