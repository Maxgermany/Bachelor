1. e4 {This game in my Latvian Gambit series features recognizable lines for a while, switching over to a particularly bloody variation where both sides lose half their pieces by the sixteenth move. After that, it's all about who can remobilize the fastest. Enjoy! } e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development. } 3. Nxe5 {This is the main line. White grabs the free pawn and threatens a dangerous attack with Qh5. } Nc6 {?! This is a questionable move at best, even for an opening of dubious merit. Black offers White a Rook for a Knight, betting that after 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Nxg6 Nf6 6.Qh3 hxg6 7.Qxh8 Qe7 his superior development will allow him to recoup his losses in the midgame. } 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Nxg6 Nf6 6. Qh4 {!? This is an interesting alternative to 6.Qh3, and allows Black the possibility of 6...Rg8 7.Nxf8 Rg4 8.Qh6 Rxe4+, winning White's e-pawn with check and creating a potentially-strong attack down the e-file after 9.Be2 Qe7. Accordingly, it is somewhat less popular than 6.Qh3, though certainly still playable. } Rg8 {Black allows White the advantage of the bishop pair--if he wishes to take it in exchange for one of his only two developed pieces. } 7. Nxf8 {White accepts the proffered Bishop. } Rg4 {Rather than take the Knight immediately and return the initiative to White's hands, Black plays to win the e-pawn and set up a dangerous battery down the e-file. } 8. Qh3 {More popular is 8.Qh6 Rxe4+ 9.Be2 Qe7 10.Nc3 Rxe2+ 11.Nxe2 Nd4 but I can see why White doesn't want to give up his material advantage this way. The text move allows the WQ to interpose along the e-file and defend c2 when needed, making 10...Rxe2 unwise. } Rxe4+ 9. Be2 Qe7 10. Nc3 {Insofar as there is any precedent in this line (there isn't much), this is all standard. Black keeps piling on the e-file and White defends it in the most reasonable ways available. } Nd4 {!? This sharp move has some precedent at least as far back as 1995, but the game here is not between Masters ;) Black keeps the pressure on, as his Rook is not in any serious danger: 11.Nxe4 Qxe4 12.Qd3 Nxc2+ 13.Kd1 Nxa1 and Black will equalize with an eventual ...Kxf8. Skipping the capture doesn't leave White all that much better-off: 11.Qd3 Nxe2 12.Nxe2 (12.Nxe4 Nf4 13.Qf3 Qxe4+ 14.Qxe4+ fxe4 15.Nxh7 Nxh7 and Black is a pawn down but has reasonable compensation) 12...d5 13.Nxh7 Nxh7 and White will struggle to develop his queenside. } 11. Qd3 Nxe2 12. Nxe4 {White decides to go for the Rook instead of playing a bit safer with 12.Nxe2. } Nf4 13. Qf3 Qxe4+ 14. Qxe4+ fxe4 15. Nxh7 Nxh7 {And here we are. Black has the advantage in mobility and development for the moment, but needs to convert it to something more substantial before White can mobilize his unopposed kingside pawn cluster.} 16. g3 {?! White prevents a check on g2 (16...Ng2+? 17.Kf1 and the Knight is lost) and drives this Knight away. I think this move weakens White's pawns unnecessarily though (Black's Bishop is eyeing h3 hungrily), as he has no pieces ready to defend himself. I think 16.O-O was simpler and stronger here.} Nd5 17. c3 d6 18. O-O Bf5 {Black really wants to set up a mate with Bf3 and Nh3, but it's still a few turns away and he's going to need his Rook involved and his King out of the way first. He also has to be careful of ...Ng5 being answered by d3! } 19. a3 {? White intends to drive Black's Knight further back with c3-c4, but he's giving up a lot of time. } O-O-O 20. c4 Nb6 {I considered 20...Nf6 instead, but was wary of giving White any opportunities for a queenside attack (with d3 and Bg5), and the text move also forces White to push another pawn in defense of c4, giving me back the initiative. } 21. b3 Ng5 {With the thought that after 22.d3, Black can play 22...Nf3+ 23.Kh1 (not 23.Kg2? Bh3+!! 24. Kxh3 Rh8+ 25.Kg4 (25.Kg2?? Rxh2#) ...Nxh2+ 26.Kf4 Nxf1 27.Kxe4 Re8+ 28.Kd4 Re1) 23...exd3 24.Be3 Be4 with a strong position. } 22. h4 {! White correctly puts off d2-d3 for another couple moves in order to solidify his position against ...Rh8. } Nf3+ 23. Kg2 Rg8 {Threatening 24...Nxh4+ and a devastating attack. } 24. Rh1 Nd7 25. d3 Nde5 {Obviously not 25...exd3? 26.Kxf3. } 26. dxe4 Bxe4 27. Kh3 {? Avoiding ...Nxh4+, winning material, but Black has an unexpected resource... } Nxh4 {! The discovered attack on the Rook makes recapture impossible: 28.Kxh4 (not 28.gxh4?? Bxh1 with mate in two from the unpreventable 29...Bg2+ 30.Kh2 (or 30.Kh4 if 29.h5) 30...Nf3#) 28...Rh8+ 29.Kg5 Rxh1 and Black should win. } 28. Re1 {White attempts to save his Rook, but this is insufficient, after 28...Bf5+, wherever the WK runs will allow 28...Nef3+, winning at least the Rook. } Bf5+ 29. Kh2 {?? 29.Kxh4 Nf3+ 30.Kh5 Nxe1 doesn't look very tempting for White, but now this is mate in six (I believe) after 29...Nef3+! } Nef3+ {0-1. White sees the upcoming mate after 30.Kh1 (six moves; try to find it before looking below) and surrenders graciously. This game is (I think) a shining example of the kind of tactics characteristic of the Latvian. After the fifteen moves each, White had a small material lead, but not a single piece developed, and it took him too long to get his remaining pieces into the game--the final position says it all, where Black has all four of his pieces engaged in the mating attack, whereas White's Rook and Bishop are barely participating.  Thanks so much to enfuego7 for the game! Any comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated; if you leave a rating please also comment letting me know why you rated the way you did. Thanks for reading! . . . 30.Kh1 Bh3! 31.Rg1 (any other move allows 31...Bg2#) ...Nxg1 32.Kxg1 Nf3+ 33.Kh1 Rh8 34.Bh6 Rxh6 35.Rg1 Bf1#. Several shorter variations are possible. }
