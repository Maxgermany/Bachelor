1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 Be7 4. d4 {Wasn't expecting this move. Bc4 is the book variation. The move played allows the displacement of the white king. Bishop is badly placed on h4 but then again white's king hinders the development of the f1 bishop. Also it has it's uses in some lines of restricting the king's movement to f2, g1.} Bh4+ 5. Ke2 d5 {Developing light squared bishop. If exd5 then c6. White can't exactly afford to be greedy because his king is situated badly and is hindering the smooth development of his pieces.} 6. Nc3 dxe4 7. Nxe4 Nf6 8. Qd3 {? Better I think to play 8. Nxf6 Bxf6 9.Bxf4. Not exactly a position to write home about but it's better than the move played in my opinion.} Qe7 {! Pinning the knight and setting up some tactical tricks on the e-file. } 9. Nxh4 Nxe4 10. Bxf4 {He was counting on this move, although it is forced. Next move black is going to play the knight to g3 or c5 and win material. The king can't move, and the queen can't interpose the check on e3 because of the f4 pawn. Now the queen can get to e3 fine.} g5 {Only move. Moving Nc5 no longer works due to Qe3. And Ng3 fails to Kf3 or Kd2 followed by Re1. Funny how attacking the king with Ng3 in this position, simultaneously gains a tempo for white, while losing a tempo for black and weakening his position by opening up the e-file.} 11. Be5 f6 12. Qxe4 gxh4 {The point of black's play.} 13. Qxh4 fxe5 14. Qh5+ Kd8 15. dxe5 Nc6 16. Rd1+ Bd7 17. Kd2 {Ugly move but how else to develop the rest of white's pieces?} Qxe5 18. Qh4+ Qe7 19. Qxe7+ Nxe7 20. Bc4 b5 21. Be2 Nd5 22. Bf3 {c4 is better maybe. Disrupting black's queenside pawn majority.} Be6 23. Rhe1 Kd7 {Defends e6 and gets rid of the problem of developing the rooks. Only possible because the white king is still hindering the development of his pieces.} 24. Kc1 {Finally he is out of the way! Really is incredible how the king has been such a nuisance to white's game for 20 moves or so. And that the problem is finally rectified on move 24! But white has played good, logical moves in my opinion and really he can't be faulted at all. Very illuminating though to the taxing effects of a displaced king early in the game.} c6 25. b3 {c4 right away looked ok to me. But he's after bigger fish...} b4 26. a3 a5 27. Re4 Rab8 28. a4 {Didn't like this move. Thought it better to keep tension on black's game. This move frees the b8 rook from it's defensive duties.} Rbf8 29. Rc4 Kd6 30. Rh4 Rf6 31. h3 h6 32. Rc4 Rhf8 33. c3 Rf6xf3 34. gxf3 bxc3 35. Rxc3 Bxh3 36. f4 Bg4 37. Rd2 Rxf4 38. Rc4 Rf1+ 39. Kb2 h5 40. b4 axb4 41. Rxb4 Kc5 42. Rb3 Bf5 43. Ka3 Ra1+ 44. Ra2 Rxa2+ 45. Kxa2 Bc2 46. Rh3 Bxa4 47. Rxh5 Bc2 48. Kb2 Be4 49. Kb3 Kd4 50. Rh4 Ne3 51. Rh8 c5 52. Rd8+ Nd5 53. Kb2 c4 54. Kc1 c3 55. Rd7 Kc4 56. Rd8 Nb4 57. Rc8+ Bc6 58. Rc7 Kb3 {Will finish annotating later sometime maybe...}
