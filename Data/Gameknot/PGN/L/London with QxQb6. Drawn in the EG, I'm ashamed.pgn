1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bf4 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. h3 e6 6. Nbd2 Qb6 7. Qb3 Be7 8. e3 O-O 9. Qxb6 {Here start the fireworks. I accept to play against the "pawn wall" because I thought they are weak and black has an uneasy game. It was only half-true.} axb6 10. Bc7 Bd8 11. Bf4 Be7 12. Bb5 Ra5 13. Bxc6 {The idea of losing the bishop pair is to make weak the c6 pawn. } bxc6 14. Ne5 Bb7 15. dxc5 bxc5 {This is a mistake: why not Bxc5? He probably wants to make pressure on the center, and use the a and b columns for attack, but he is making my a pawn free.} 16. O-O Rb5 17. b3 Ra8 18. a4 Rb6 {Now, it follows a headache for me. Ra2, in order to prepare the advance of the a pawn, or g2-g4, in order to get out the knight from f6 and let me get in in d7 (but it is not clear), or c4, trying to block the doubled black pawns but losing a very good square for my both knights... ????} 19. e4 {I made this "not natural" move. The idea is that the situation must be "unblocked", and that it's useless to try to keep blocked his bishop pair if I cannot progress.  Obviously, my advantage lies in the a pawn, but it is not easy to advance it. I must simplify the situation first. } d4 {If he takes my pawn, wins one, but then he has two doubled pawns, and this is no good at all. But I think that to hold, and wait for me to exchange, would have been better for him. Of course I would not. } 20. Nec4 Rba6 21. cxd4 cxd4 {I "freed" him. Normally, it should not be done. But in this case, I think it is better. } 22. Nd6 {Now this is premature. I thought about Be5, c5 first. Anyway, his bishop pair - his only strenght - is lost.} Ra6a7 23. Nd2c4 Ba6 {I didn't considered this one on my previous move. I believed I should have had time to play f3 and save my center pawn. But I know that this will allow him to separate my b pawn from the a, and this can be the difference between a win and a drawn. } 24. Rfc1 Bxc4 25. Rxc4 Bxd6 26. Bxd6 Nxe4 27. Rxd4 Nxd6 28. Rxd6 Rb7 {Relax. My advantage stand still, if I can take the c pawn I win.  } 29. Rb1 {Relax is mortal. This horrible move make me lose my advantage.  I played it because I have a checkmate with my rook, but...} Kf8 {I don't have it anymore. } 30. Rxc6 {And I forgot it. Ok, pawns are still equal, but the PAIR of them was my advantage. } Rxa4 {Half of my advantage is now gone, and I can beg for drawn. Now it is a long and boring final, I doubt I can play very well. } 31. bxa4 Rxb1+ 32. Kh2 Ra1 33. Rc4 Ke7 34. f4 Ra3 35. h4 h5 36. g3 g6 37. Rc7+ Kf6 38. Ra7 e5 39. fxe5+ Kxe5 40. a5 f6 41. Rg7 Kf5 42. Ra7 Kg4 43. Ra6 {Great mistake. But my position is difficult, anyway. His rook is active, mine is defending my pawn. I didn't "see" it planning the final strategy.} Ra2+ 44. Kg1 Kxg3 45. Rxf6 Ra1+ {This way he prevents me to take back the g pawn. } 46. Rf1 Rxa5 47. Rf6 Ra1+ 48. Rf1 Ra6 49. Rf8 Kxh4 50. Kg2 Kg4 51. Rf7 h4 52. Rf1 Ra2+ 53. Rf2 Rxf2+ 54. Kxf2 h3 55. Kg1 Kg3 56. Kh1 g5 57. Kg1 g4 58. Kh1 Kf2 59. Kh2 g3+ 60. Kxh3 g2 {}
