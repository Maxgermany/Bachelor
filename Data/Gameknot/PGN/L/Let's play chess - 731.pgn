[Opening "Vienna game (C26)"]

1. e4 {This is a standard opening for me. i normally play this to try and lead into a vienna and a quick attacking position. sometimes it works and sometimes it can totally back fire. Its normally either this or play it safe. personally I like the risk} e5 {standard, this leads into vienna or ruy lopez which ever I prefer.} 2. Nc3 {Vienna Game!} Nf6 {Standard Viennan protocl counter attack and put pressure on the center squares} 3. Bc4 {this is sadly my normal response, I've played around with this and with Nf3, so far this is what is ingrained in my brain. i haven't heard it's bad yet, but it probably isn't too good either.Attack on f pawn and developement and that's just about it. it is under the lines though,  for good or for worse I'm not sure} Bc5 {?attack on f pawn. can't move Ng4 for attack. this is only a developing move that allows castling sooner.} 4. Nf3 {standard, attack the center pawn and also allow the king to castle into safety shortly following the black king. } d6 {Expected, protects center paawn and activates the white squared bishop. pin on g4 coming, blockable and defendable though. no worries yet} 5. O-O {castle,and get that king out of the center!} Bg4 {pin. irksome but dealable with, another down side to Bc4, you have ot bring your bishop back to deal with pins! or press h3} 6. Be2 {bishop back best not to force a bad position and getting the castle ripped to shreds with a bishop sacrifice on h6.} Nc6 {Developing move potential knight outpost on d4, gets him ahead in development. my black bishop is bad, due to its unmoveablity, he's one step ahead in development} 7. Na4 {good find, bishop will die for a knight. gets rid of piece front in the center, only problem is it it's actually a blunder, Nxe5 as I would shortly realize} Nxe4 {yep. how do you say ow in french, oh ow, aw?} 8. Nxc5 {might as well accomplish my original intent} Nxc5 {yep, doesn't want doubled pawns on the c file. time to get by black bishop into play} 9. d3 {cuts off the knight outpost on e4 as well as opens up my once bad bishop} e4 {irk? I take, he takes and then the center opens up. sweet, he pushed to early and now I've got a chance to play some tactics and with any luck get that pawn back.} 10. dxe4 {bye bye pawnie!} Nxe4 {Yep, as he planned} 11. Nd2 {odd move on my part, accomplishes the surprise attack I guess. if he takes bishop, i take back with Queen and pin knight, he gets f5 and then i win the pwan back, that or he loses a minor pice, whichever he prefers..............or he takes my knight, and i'm bakc where i started with less pieces, a pawn down and ............with an open center!} Nxd2 {Yep, smart chocie, wise man. Take back with the bishop and it gets developed.} 12. Bxd2 {yep, and now if  he isn't smart that bishop is toast or if he does something stupid like protecting even more fun!} Ne5 {??????????????????????? Game over. and it's move 12, bxbishop, knight take back and then queen back I'm up a minor piece and down a pawn. pretty much game over} 13. Bxg4 {!!!!!!!!!!!not what he was expecting, realization dawns.........} Nxg4 {yep, at that point better is to not finish the trade and cut your losses.} 14. Qxg4 {Attacks open up!} O-O {another near blunder, first tihng you see is bh6 next right, one escape and that's qf6, lucky for him shes still on home base} 15. Bh6 {fun time, too bad at this point i didn't see that the rook would be mine} Qf6 {yep, expected now that i look at it, black's best response} 16. Bc1 {ah! protecting and saving the bishop and pawn} Rae8 {yep, take the open file} 17. c3 {no more worries b pawn!} h6 {no more bishop posting i guess} 18. Be3 {block the file attack the pawn!} g5 {irk, death to pawn!} 19. Bd4 {or not, I guess I wanted to attack his queen first? weird. } Qg6 {reasonable manuever, whatever i was thinking was stupid} 20. Rfe1 {challenging for the file} f5 {chasing the queen out} 21. Qf3 {yep, two pawns under threat now and only a temporary defense with b6. {Qb7}following} c5 {ah bishop removal, time to trade down a bit.........} 22. Rxe8 {standard protocol now r or q takes} Rxe8 {R, time for evasive bishop manuevers!} 23. Qd5+ {but first a check...............for old times sake} Kh7 {ah, perfect, I get a pawn and still he must make forced moves!} 24. Be3 {odd, I should of just taken the pawn, i guess I was just a little too worried about that bishop and forgetting him out there with that nasty old c pawn} b6 {one good move revealing a secondary forgotten a pawn} 25. Qb7+ {yep, bye bye Triple A} Kg8 {expectable, doens't really matter where he moves. either that or blcok with the queen and trade more} 26. Qxa7 {1 more point for the taking.} f4 {ew.........good move Sacodia} 27. Bxf4 {now i'm confused, why wouldn't bishop d2 work................oh I see, Re2, bishop either kills itself or its mate, now I now what I was thinking} Qe4 {ow! only problem is he's forgetting my bishop .........he should of taken it and gotten back in life} 28. Be3 {lucky save, it was a good thought, I got lucky there} h5 {now the pawn advance and the tempatation of Bxg5, which I will dufully ignore} 29. Qxb6 {Death of a pawn!} Re6 {expected, keep the remainders alive} 30. Qd8+ {yep, I was wondering if that was next, gets the king out in the open.} Kf7 {yeah, even better! i guess rook blocking wouldn't work, I am out of today. maybe that's why i'm analyzing this.} 31. Qxg5 {yep, fauder of queen} h4 {save the h pawn! all hail Harry Potter!} 32. Qf4+ {wow, ok queens will be gone in half a second} Qxf4 {natural response, makes perfect sense} 33. Bxf4 {yepm keeps the attack pressed hard on the d pawn} Rg6 {treying to get anything and going for everything he's got left} 34. a4 {i don't personally care, i've got a passed pawn on the far side and he's got no nice way to stop it!} h3 {yep finish the plan and i'll block it........} 35. g3 {blockage compartment} Ke6 {going after quadropule A!} 36. a5 {IT's A LIVE ! A PAWN!} Rg8 {stopping now may come at at a price................} 37. a6 {run Forrest run!} Ra8 {Stop HIM!} 38. a7 {put some pressure on him!} Kd7 {we need backup calling in the SWAT king} 39. g4 {haha! George just woke up!} Rf8 {nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!a8=Q, death follows shortly, the castle is caving in and will fall...........} 40. a8=Q {Please take me........oh please take me.........} Rxa8 {bye bye lady..............} 41. Rxa8 {death to the mercanary archer!} Kc6 {run away, we need to get past those two hooligans up there!} 42. Ra6+ {ZAP!} Kd5 {I won't go back alone..................!!!!!!!!!!!!} 43. Rxd6+ {ZAP!.........FLASH! ..........HAHAH king of the impossible or in this case rook of the impossible} Ke4 {bishop in trouble, maverick's in trouble he's heading out to see in a flat spin} 44. Bg3 {safety} c4 {advancing orc} 45. Rd4+ {bye bye orcie.......} Kf3 {now the pathetic part of my game comes in , it takes me hmmmmmmmmmmmmm..........................12 moves to get him and I have to promote.............LOL. The following proves that my endgame and checkmate theory badly needs work} 46. b3 {after all I've got to wipe the board clean .........} cxb3 {yep, only move other than instant and subtonuoes death} 47. Rb4 {jump.....} b2 {I'm almost there !} 48. Rxb2 {snatch, now i've got you!} Kxg4 {run away!} 49. c4 {oh and i forget I'm in need of my lovely lady once again..........don't ask me why?} Kf5 {pawn jumper} 50. c5 {run away} Ke6 {i'm going to cut you off, too bad Maverick over there is providing a long line of back up} 51. c6 {a newborn lady coming this way.} Ke7 {no better choice} 52. c7 {one away} Kd7 {coming up to get her} 53. Rb8 {my sneak quick trick} Ke6 {retreat, from the knights who say NEE! Oh yeah, i mean qqqqueen. just trying to make my slow play more interesting} 54. c8=Q+ {CHECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The end is near 2012} Kd5 {run,run,run,run} 55. Rb5+ {cutting him off.} Ke4 {best choice maybe. i would of tried Kd4 actually} 56. Qc4+ {basic ladder} Kf3 {only move, he'll be trapped beside Maverick} 57. Rb3# {ZAp, good game, Sacodia . i thank you all for seeing my hopeful enteratining annotation and a happy funny good night...........Gator}
