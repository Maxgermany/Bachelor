1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 {The most classical line in the giocco piano} Bc5 5. c3 d6 {I usually play 5. d5 which leads to a more opened situation.} 6. a4 a6 7. O-O O-O 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 Ba7 10. Nbd2 {Joining rooks and queen and developping. } g5 {Pawn storm is launched.} 11. Bg3 g4 {I wanted to try a pawn storm and, as the move is in the world DB and lead to a black win, I supposed it was ok, don't knowing precisely why.} 12. Nh4 {Leaving the DB} Nh5 13. b4 Kg7 {The GK computer says it's an inaccuracy. There was no hurry to set the king out of the fireline of the LSB. 13. Nxg3 would have been better.} 14. Kh1 Ne7 {preparing a trading sequence on f5} 15. f3 Nxg3+ {I should have plaid this move earlier (see comment on move 13)} 16. hxg3 h5 {Protecting the g pawn and trying to open the h file} 17. f4 f5 {The GK computer prefers d5} 18. fxe5 dxe5 {Logical trade} 19. exf5 Nxf5 {Now black has an isolated pawn and white has double isolated pawns both Kings are weak, the material is equal, the center and open files are contested, black controls the long white diagonal. The situation seems even.} 20. Nxf5+ {White has little other choice to prevent both 20. Nxg3 and 20. Nxe3, 2 forks attack.} Bxf5 {Joining the rooks and queen} 21. Qe2 {Attacking black's isolated pawn and joining the rooks} Qe7 {Protecting the isolated pawn and joining the rooks} 22. Ne4 c6 {Taking control of d5. Black's plan is to play a further h4 and if gxh4Qxe4 + mate. but it's not possible now due to : 22... h4 23. Rxf5 Rxf5 24. Qxg4+} 23. b5 Bxe4 24. Qxe4 Qg5 {24. Bf2 would have been better but black sticks to his plan (advancing h4)} 25. d4 {Blocking the a7g1 diagonal} h4 {Now, I estimate that the time comes} 26. gxh4 {White has little other choice} Qxh4+ 27. Kg1 {Forced move} Qg5 {To prevent 28. Qxe5+ and protect g4. GK computer preconises exd4 but I was to afraid of Qxe5+. In such an edged to edged situation and wide open game with many pièces still on board, it's a risky business to be set in chess.} 28. bxc6 {Menacing to promote the c pawn... but the computer estimâtes that 28. b6 would have been better.} exd4 {If 29. cxb7 or 29. c7, 29. ... dxc3+ with mate to follow...} 29. cxd4 {... but white sees the danger.} bxc6 {... So that black  takes. If 30. Qxc6 Qxd4+ with mate to follow by 31. Rh8} 30. Rad1 Rad8 {The d pawn, blocking the dark diagonal is important} 31. g3 a5 {To prepare the endgame, having the pawns on the bishop's colours} 32. Rxf8 Rxf8 {Trade} 33. Be6 {menacing g4 which black cannot protect} Rf3 {So that black menaces g3} 34. Kg2 {protecting g3 and unpinning the d pawn.} Bb8 {increasing the pressure on g3} 35. Rd3 Rxd3 {No choice} 36. Qxd3 Kf6 {Menacing to take the LSB and setting the king on a black square} 37. d5 {Now the draw is sure.} cxd5 38. Qxd5 Qxd5+ 39. Bxd5 Kg5 40. Bc6 {}
