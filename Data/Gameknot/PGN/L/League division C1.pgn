1. d4 {I am annotating this on behalf of my good friend Jeremy (Teardrop34). } Nf6 2. c4 {So it starts conventionally enough.} g6 3. Nc3 {With possibilities of the Gruenfeld or the King's Indian.} d5 4. Nf3 {So it is a Gruenfeld...} Bg7 5. Qb3 {This is The Russian Variation - a well respected variation. It was possible to go back into the exchange variation with 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 c5 8. Rb1 O-O 9. Be2. I tend to think both are good answers to the Gruenfeld.} dxc4 6. Qxc4 {This exchange is normal - black gives up the centre and hopes to then counter-attack it.} O-O 7. e4 {All standard so far.} a6 8. Be2 {I think it looks strange, because it gives up the d5 square but in this position, e5 is the most commonly played move, not Be2 (which looks very natural to me). e5 often leads to the famous queen sacrifice line Be6 9. exf6	Bxc4 10. fxg7 Kxg7 11.	Bxc4	where white has given up a pawn and queen for two bishops and a knight. The verdict is out on this position - but it is considered roughly equal. This is now the Alekhine (Hungarian) variation of the Russian Gruenfeld!} b5 9. Qd3 {The queen retreat to b3 is far more common than to d3.} Bb7 10. d5 {The Gameknot Post Game Computer Analysis (PGCA) gives this as white's first mistake and I tend to agree. (and so does Fritz!)} c6 11. O-O {Fritz seems to think it was time for white to bail out with d5xc6.} cxd5 12. Rd1 {Fritz here likes e4-e5 as well as Rd1.} Nc6 13. Nxd5 {Fritz likes this move.} Nxd5 14. exd5 {and this one...} Nb4 {This fork of the Qd3 and d5 wins back the extra pawn for black. I think without this both white is better.} 15. Qb3 {Fritz thinks this is the best square for the queen.} Nxd5 16. a4 {this seems quite logical, undermining black's queen side.} b4 17. a5 {This too, preventing the black queen-side pawn connecting.} e6 18. Ne1 {Looks a little odd, but quite sensible - the knight is coming to c2 or d3 to attack b4.} Qe7 {Protecting b4 again.} 19. Bd2 {and attacking b4 again.} Rfd8 {as the c and d files are open, they seem the obvious files to put the rooks.} 20. Rac1 {and white has similar thoughts...} Rac8 21. Nd3 {attacking b4 for the 3rd time.} Rcb8 {Indirectly protecting b4 but it does make his previous move look a little odd...} 22. Rc4 {Piling up the pressure on b4} Ba8 {Opening up rook protection of b4} 23. Qc2 {Fritz prefers Qa4, maintaining the pressure on b4.} b3 {Giving white queen the choice of two safe squares.} 24. Qb1 {and white picks the wrong square - c1 was better...} Rdc8 {Contesting the c file.} 25. Rdc1 {White white correctly refuses to concede.} Rxc4 {When a pawn ahead, it is normally a good idea to exchange pieces but not pawns.} 26. Rxc4 {White takes back.} Qd6 {Black re-adjusts his queen.} 27. Qc1 {White corrects the earlier mistake, and takes a firm grip of the c file. Unfortunately his rook hasn't any decent entry squares.} Ne7 {This gives white an entry square on c7} 28. Bf4 {White is fighting back.} e5 {But black is fighting too!} 29. Be3 {The bishop is driven back.} Nc6 {and black blocks the c file.} 30. Bb6 {White blocks the protection of b3 by the black rook.} Qd5 {black now only has to move his Nc6 and he threatens mate on g2.} 31. Bf1 {So white puts paid to that!} e4 {Black advances again.} 32. Nb4 {Attacking queen and knight, virtually forcing the following exchange.} Nxb4 {Black takes.} 33. Rxb4 {White recaptures.} Bb7 {Not sure of the point of this move.} 34. Bc4 {White is working to capture on b3.} Rc8 {But black pins the bishop.} 35. Be3 {Protecting the queen, so threatening Bc4xQd5 again.} Qd7 {So the queen retreats.} 36. Qd2 {White offers an exchange of queens. If accepted b3 is falling, restoring material equality. Here it was agreed a draw, on black's suggestion.}
