1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 4. Nc3 a6 5. d3 b5 {Note to self: if you see an a6 at this stage of the game, it can only mean that a pawn wants your bishop. Act immediately to forestall it. Don't waste your one and only chance.} 6. Bd5 Bc5 7. O-O Nf6 8. Be3 Bxe3 9. fxe3 Ng4 {The way to guard against that is to keep a knight controlling h4.} 10. Re1 O-O 11. d4 exd4 12. exd4 Rb8 13. Qd3 {Not good. It invites the following move, which makes me hustle and waste two moves saving a queen and a knight.} Nb4 14. Qd2 Bb7 15. Qe2 c6 16. Ne5 {Looking at this move from several weeks down the road, I don't think I should have done this.} Nxe5 17. Ref1 {Could have had the knight at e5.} cxd5 18. dxe5 {Now I take the knight. I was probably thinking backing up my pawn when it captures into the f file.} d4 {Good move on Bignoodle's part. Forces me to retreat my knight and wins a pawn.} 19. Nd1 Rc8 20. c3 d3 21. Qf2 Bxe4 {This move puts heaping pressure on my g-pawn, and his queen can double-attack it with 22. ... Qd4.} 22. cxb4 {But like the Material Girl that I am, I do this instead.} Rc2 {This move definitely earns two exclamation points (!!). Bignoodle skewers the g-pawn needed for his mating attack.} 23. Qd4 Qg5 {The pawn is triple-attacked. I go down for the count.}
