1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 {Not the best second move out there. Technically playable, but it tends to block up the K-side.} 3. Nc3 c6 4. d4 {I look to develop quickly and take control of the center.} h6 {I'm guessing this was to prevent 5 B-KN5, but it slows Black's K-side development further.} 5. Bc4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 {The Queens are off the board, but I have central control and a huge edge in development.} Bb4 8. Bd2 {Getting my last minor piece into play.} a5 {Why waste time with another Pawn move? Black should be looking to develop pieces.} 9. O-O Bd6 {I'm confused by this. The Bishop was not threatened and this move threatens nothing.} 10. Rfe1 Be5 11. Nf3 d6 {Black gives me the opportunity to open and seize the Queen file.} 12. Nxe5 dxe5 13. Rad1 {I do so.} Bg4 14. f3 Be6 15. Bxe6 {Now I double and isolate the Black KP. I hope to be able to exploit the weakened Black Pawn structure in the coming end game.} fxe6 16. Be3 {Opening the Q file to my Rook's fire.} Nd7 17. Na4 Ne7 {Wow, Black actually develops two pieces in two moves. However, I've already converted my advantage in time [by its very nature, a temporary thing] into an advantage in Pawn structure, a much more permanent problem for Black.} 18. Nc5 Nxc5 19. Bxc5 Ng6 {We've reached the endgame. I am up a minor exchange and am in position to use the Q-file as an invasion route to the weak Black Pawns. I like my chances.} 20. g3 {Restricting Black's Knight.} h5 21. Kg2 h4 {Black advances the KRP, a maneuver which does little to free his game.} 22. Reh1 h3+ 23. Kf2 Ra6 24. a4 {Preventing K-side expansion and locking in the Black KR.} b6 25. Be3 c5 26. c4 {With the Pawn position on the K-side locked and Black's Q-side Pawns a mess, I just need to invade with my Rooks.} Ne7 27. Rd6 {Here comes a Rook down the Q-file...} Kf7 28. Rhd1 {...and another Rook in support.} Kf6 29. Rd6d7 Nc6 30. Rc7 Nb4 31. Rdd7 {"Pigs on the 7th" -- always dangerous, usually voracious.} Rf8 32. Rdxg7 {One Pawn falls.} Nc2 33. Rgh7 Nxe3 34. Kxe3 {Every simplification helps me now. If the Black KRP falls, my K-side Pawns will decide the game.} Raa8 35. Rcd7 {I make sure to keep control of the Q-file.} Rad8 36. g4 Kg5 37. Kf2 {I intend to win the Black KRP with my King.} Rfg8 38. Kg3 Rxd7 39. Rxd7 {A pair of Rooks fall, and I still control the Q-file. Black can do little that is useful.} Kg6 40. Kxh3 Rg7 {Black's last hope topples with this blunder. After the exchange, the King-and-Pawn ending is easy to win. } 41. Rxg7+ Kxg7 42. Kh4 {I have Pawn moves in reserve if I need to use them. I need to advance my King.} Kg6 43. h3 Kg7 44. Kg5 {Seizing the Opposition.} Kf7 45. Kh6 Kf6 46. h4 {This Pawn move forces the Black King to retreat and lets me seize a position to guard my Pawn's Queening square.} Ke7 47. g5 Kf7 48. Kh7 {Black resigns, as the KNP cannot be stopped from becoming a Queen.}
