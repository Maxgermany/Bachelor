1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 {Queen's Gambit Declined.} 3. Nf3 {QGD Slav.} Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 5. e3 Be7 6. b3 {White usually plays Bd3 here.  But this move seems to work well.  Black usually responds by castling...} b6 {...but not this time.} 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. Bb2 O-O {..and that is out of the database.} 9. O-O Qc7 10. e4 e5 11. cxd5 cxd5 12. dxe5 dxe4 13. Nxe4 Nxe5 {That pawn is going to cost, because white has a knight and bishop on e5, but black has only the queen attacking it.  Maybe Ng4 would have been better.} 14. Nxe5 Nxe4 {BxNe4 threatens the black rook, giving white opportunity to rescue the wayward knight.} 15. Bxe4 Bf6 {White will take the rook.  For a knight?  Any day and twice on Sunday.} 16. Bxa8 Bxe5 17. Bxe5 Qxe5 18. Re1 Qg5 19. Qd5 Qg6 {Black is well advised to avoid even material trades now, down a rook.} 20. Qf3 {}
