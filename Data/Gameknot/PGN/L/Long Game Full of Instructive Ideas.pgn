[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 {This is by far the longest game to annotate, but it has so many instructive points, and is a perfect game between 2 "average" rated players on this site.} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {Black is playing his queen out too early, so white can immediately attack it. The Scandinavian Defense is OK, but 2...Nf6 is more fundamentally sound.} 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 c6 {Typical book line? It is, but in the opening, we should worry ourselves with the development of the pieces, and not play moves like this. Black is simply trying to stall his development but create a sort of position in which white cannot use the development. It is not a fully correct idea, and is very difficult to implement, since the attack is easier to play for white, and black's defense needs to be more carefully played.  3...Nf6 was my best choice.} 5. Nf3 Bg4 {Again, we should have played 5...Nf6, playing a move that MUST be played sooner or later. } 6. Be2 {White breaks the pin. A fine move, but all he needed to do was 6.h3, and followed with 7.g4, kicking the bishop off. Since white has more development, it easily compensates for his weaknesses.} e6 7. a3 {To be honest, although this breaks the principles, it is actually a decent idea that is in many scandinavian lines. The purpose is to control the b4 square, and prevent the black queen and bishop from using it. Also, white may play b4 in some lines. I probably would have just castled.} Nd7 8. O-O Bd6 9. Ne4 {Good move for white, an attacking move, so he should put it on high priority.} Qc7 {This move is definitely a poor one. As we can see, the d6 bishop is the good bishop, and it also controls the black's weak dark squares. So now white should take the opportunity and grab the bishop, getting an even bigger advantage in the line---10.Nxd6 Qxd6 11.b3 followed by a4, and now the black's weak dark squares will be under the attack. White has a clear advantage here.} 10. Ng3 {White fails to take the opportunity, and now his advantage has become very little. One of the best ways to get a good position is to trade your knight for the opponent's bishop, especially in the open and dynamic pawn structures. A bishop's activity is by far the most ranged of the pieces. Sometimes it is a big pawn with a hat, but at others it is almost equaling a rook in power(13B/14R maximum controls). In the open position, bishops are favored, but in dynamic structures, we can now work on creating a favorable pawn structure.} Ngf6 11. c4 {Good idea for white to activate his pawns, and they will give him good space.} O-O-O {This choice is very risky, and I really don't like it too much. It may not be so bad, but white has the c4 and d4 pawns attacking towards the queenside. If white can quickly get his queenside attack in, black is in big trouble. Certainly a kingside castling was much safer.} 12. c5 {This pawn move lets go of the nice square d5. However, it is not bad. White is gaining more space on the queenside, and fixing the b7 pawn. Secondly, he is forcing the dark squared bishop to an exchange, which will weaken the dark squares, or to go backwards, where it is weaker. White intends to follow with b4 and b5.} Bxg3 {Another instructive mistake by black. White gets a clear advantage now.  Black has traded a key bishop for a weaker knight, and his dark squares are so weak after hxg3 and Bf4. White's attack obviously comes first.} 13. fxg3 {Very strange. White's intention is to activate his rook immediately, but in these types of position, it is almost always right to take with the h pawn. Firstly, white would need serious justification to weaken the central squares, and a major endgame disadvantage. Also, white is attacking on the queenside, so this makes no sense. Much better was hxg3. However, at least white takes back the piece, and this mistake is not as serious as the black's last move.} Ne4 {Black immediately takes control of the weak square. There is a major problem--It fails tactically. The black queen has only a5 as a safe square, and after b4 it will be trapped. So after Bf4, black is in big trouble. That is why .,..Nd5 was the best move, with a advantage for white, but a complex position.} 14. Bf4 {Now white is just winning.} e5 15. Nxe5 {Black is losing a lot of material. There is the attack on g4, as well as a discovery.} Bxe2 16. Qxe2 Nxe5 17. Bxe5 Qd7 {Black could not save the piece with 17...Qe7 18.Qxe4 f6 19.Qg4+} 18. Qxe4 f6 19. Bd6 {OK. So white is a full bishop up, and should be winning? Yes, but the technical grind is very instructive.} Rde8 20. Qf5 Re2 21. Qxd7+ Kxd7 22. b4 Rhe8 23. Rf2 Re8e4 24. Kf1 Rxf2+ {This is a huge mistake for sure. When losing, black needed to play R2e3, and that would avoid the trades. Now everything is easy for white. He will lose one pawn, but he has no more problems. By the way, black was losing in either line, but we should still put up max resistance.} 25. Kxf2 Rxd4 26. Re1 Rd2+ 27. Re2 Rxe2+ {Another trade makes things easy.} 28. Kxe2 Ke6 29. Ke3 Kd5 30. Kd3 f5 31. h3 {Black's king is active, but it is not very useful. White's idea now is to fix the black pawns on the dark squares.} b5 32. g4 {White simply needed to take EP, and he has a majority, and pawws pawn. That would be the easiest win. Now things actually get interesting.} fxg4 33. hxg4 g6 {White's pawns are fixed on the dark squares, and black the opposite. This is not what white wants.} 34. g5 Ke6 {And now, if black had the ability to pass and not move, he would have a draw in this posiiton! Black just needs to put the pawn on a6, keep the king on e6 and he automatically draws! However, white can now force the king back with zugswang.} 35. g4 Kf7 36. Ke4 Ke6 37. Bg3 a6 38. Bf4 {White is using the bishop to "pass" in the position. } Kd7 39. Bc7 {!!!??? A very strange idea. White only has to use the king to play 29.Ke5 and the win goes easily. If black takes the bishop, then he loses both pawns on the kingside.} Ke6 {White simply wasted time.} 40. Bd8 Kd7 41. Ke5 Kxd8 42. Kf6 {White finds the right way to win.} Kd7 43. Kg7 Ke6 44. Kxh7 Kd5 45. Kxg6 Kc4 {So now the win is trivial. } 46. Kf7 Kb3 47. g6 Kxa3 48. g7 Kxb4 49. g8=Q a5 50. Ke6 a4 51. Kd6 a3 52. Kxc6 Kc3 53. Kxb5 Kb2 54. c6 a2 55. c7 a1=Q 56. Qh8+ {Black now resigns-A very interesting game.}
