1. e4 {I decided to annotate this game because it has an ending that I like, it shows you need to keep a careful eye on your opponent and not to be distracted by specific areas of the board.} e5 2. f4 {I recently played in a Kings Gambit tournament and really enjoyed it, this is an attempt to continue my experimentation with the various lines.} d6 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. Bc4 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 exf4 6. Qxf4 Qf6 7. O-O Qxf4 8. Rxf4 f6 {This move takes us out of the Gameknot database (where Nc3 is preferred), most likely because it opens a nice line for my lsb and means that black cannot castle kingside.} 9. d4 {Claiming the centre and making room to develop my dsb. My broad plan is to harass blacks attempts to castle and to double my rooks on the half open f file} Nc6 10. d5 Ne5 11. Bb5+ c6 12. dxc6 bxc6 13. Ba4 Nh6 14. Be3 Be7 15. Bb3 Nhf7 16. Nd2 O-O 17. Raf1 Ng6 18. Rf4f3 Kh8 19. a4 {I can't recall why I made this move it seems a bit pointless} Nfe5 {Although black had clearly planned for this move it makes my lsb much more powerful. Also notice that the black king can't move and it won't be easy to make space without creating weaknesses} 20. Rh3 {My new plan is to double rooks on h and if needed, sacrifice a piece to break open the black kings position} a6 21. Rf5 Nf7 22. Rfh5 {The only thorn in my side is black's knight on g6 and I can't see a way of moving it. The threat is Rxh7 of course} h6 23. Bxf7 Rxf7 24. Bxh6 {The sacrifice I mentioned earlier, though with hindsight I am not sure it was sound} gxh6 25. Rh5xh6+ Kg7 26. Rh6h7+ Kg8 27. Rh7h6 Rg7 28. Nf3 {heading for h4} Kf7 29. Rh6h7 Rxh7 30. Rxh7+ Ke6 {black wisely retreats however he is forced to stay behind his pawn wall which my rook is staring down} 31. c4 Rb8 32. Nd4+ Kd7 {is Ke5 better?} 33. b3 c5 34. Nf5 Rxb3 35. h4 {This move served two purposes, firstly the pawn is passed and so should be pushed but also it is threatening h5 to remove the defender of the black dsb} Rb8 36. h5 Nf4 37. Rxe7+ Kc6 38. h6 Rh8 {I'm not sure this move was neccessary, it certainly in no way prevents h7, my only problem is how to extricate the black rook} 39. a5 {The purpose of this move was to keep the black king hemmed in behind his pawns but as we will see it turns out to be more useful than that} Ne2+ {This doesn't really achieve anything other than allowing me to move my king up the board} 40. Kf2 Nc3 41. Ra7 {I had a plan to shuffle my knight about and get it to g8 however it was then I realised that the black king couldn't actually move and therefore the threat was Ne7# } Nxe4+ 42. Ke3 {preventing further checks} Ng5 {d5 seems to me to be called for, Re8 tempts h7} 43. Ne7# {The passed h pawn served as a distraction from the state of the king and so black overlooked the threat to the kings safety  Thanks for reading please comment}
