1. b3 {I hate it when people play moves like this! It means I have to start thinking from move 1!} e5 2. Bb2 d6 {Don't block in your king's bishop unless you are forced to. 2...Nc6 was better.} 3. e3 e4 {It disrupts White's development, but it also increases the power of his bishop. Better was 3...Nf6.} 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. h3 a6 {The second unnecessary pawn move in the opening!} 6. Qe2 Be7 7. O-O-O O-O 8. g4 Nc6 {This is more like it. Black has a good solid position and should be able to cope with anything that White throws at him.} 9. f4 exf3 e.p. {This is what White wanted you to do! It enables him to develop his knight and he also gains an open file for his attack on your king. Better was 9...b5.} 10. Nxf3 Nd7 {Why move it when you don't have to? Again 10...b5 was best. If you had to move the knight, then e8 is a better square. It doesn't obstruct your bishop and it also protects the weak square g7.} 11. h4 f6 {Before this move you had no weaknesses on the kingside, so nothing for White to attack. 11...b5 was still the move.} 12. Qd3 Nce5 {The wrong knight.} 13. Qd5+ Kh8 14. Nd4 Nb6 15. Qe4 Nxg4 {Tempting, but your knight was wonderfully placed on e5 and by capturing with the bishop you develop a piece and threaten his rook.} 16. Bd3 g6 17. Rdf1 f5 {I think it's only safe to play this if you are going to play ...Bf6 next move.} 18. Qf3 d5 {I think a better plan was to reactivate your knight by playing 18...Nd7 followed by ...Ne5.} 19. Nxd5 Bf6 20. c4 {??? The simple Nxf6 followed by h5 should be winning.} Nxd5 21. cxd5 Ne5 22. Qe2 Nxd3+ 23. Qxd3 c5 {What was wrong with 23...Qxd5? 24...c5 is then a real threat.} 24. Nf3 Bxb2+ 25. Kxb2 Qf6+ 26. Kb1 b5 {At last!} 27. Rfc1 Qd6 {You now have the initiative, so press on with the attack with 27...c4!} 28. h5 Kg7 29. Qc3+ Rf6 {You must contest control of the diagonal by playing 29...Qf6.} 30. Rcg1 Qxd5 {I think you had to play 30...Bb7 and hope to survive the attack.} 31. h6+ Kf7 32. Ng5+ Ke7 33. Nxh7 Re6 {33...Rd6 threatening 34...Qd3  looks better.} 34. Qg7+ Kd6 35. Nf6 Qd3+ {Doesn't achieve anything. 35...Qe5, threatening the knight, is better. It keeps the pieces co-ordinated.} 36. Kc1 Re7 37. Qxg6 Be6 38. h7 Rh8 39. Rh6 c4 40. Qg3+ Kc5 41. Qe5+ Kb4 42. Nd5+ Qxd5 43. Qxh8 cxb3 44. Qc3+ Ka4 45. h8=Q bxa2 46. Rh4+ Qc4 47. Rxc4+ {}
