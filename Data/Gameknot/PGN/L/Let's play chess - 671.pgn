1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {The first unusual move of the game. If followed up by P-Q4, White can get a strong center, but the drawback is that it takes away the natural developmental square for the QN.} Nf6 4. Qe2 {Here we see the problem: White cannot guard his KP with his QN, so now his KB is blocked in.} d5 5. exd5 Qxd5 {I have an advantage in development and a better center. Therefore I have to be aggressive or these advantages will dissipate.} 6. c4 Qa5 7. Nc3 Bg4 {Pinning the knight and attempting to convert my extra tempi into a spatial advantage.} 8. g3 {White must use 2 moves to develop his KB, and it accentuates his cramped position.} Bb4 9. Qe3 O-O {I hasten to connect my Rooks and seize the center.} 10. Bg2 Rfe8 11. O-O Qb6 {The Q is White's best-posted piece. if I can exchange it off I can seize the center and split his forces in two.} 12. Qg5 {Naturally, White tries to avoid this.} Bc5 {I double on the diagonal, with ...BxPch a future threat.} 13. Nh4 {White tries to generate a counterattack.} h6 {He overlooks this riposte. The Q has no flight square! This effectively ends the game, although my opponent has the spirit and will to win necessary to become a top player. He gamely fights on another 20 moves.} 14. Qf5 Bxf5 15. Nxf5 Ng4 {Now it's a matter of technique. I need to keep my King safe and trade down.} 16. d4 exd4 17. Nd5 Qa5 18. Bf4 Rac8 19. Rad1 Ne7 20. Nxd4 Nxd5 21. Bxd5 {One minor piece is exchanged.} c6 22. Bf3 h5 23. Bxg4 hxg4 {Another one goes.} 24. Bd2 Qxa2 25. Nf5 Qxc4 {A couple of loose Pawns fall.} 26. Bf4 Rcd8 {Trying to vaporize a pair of Rooks.} 27. Rdc1 Qd5 28. Ne3 Bxe3 29. fxe3 {A third minor piece goes. Now it's just a matter of closing the deal.} Qb3 30. h4 Qxb2 {I see a potential mate. if I can get a Rook onto the 7th rank...} 31. Rfe1 Rd7 32. Kf1 Rd2 {Since my opponent resolutely refuses to exchange Rooks, I decide to close him out with a mate.} 33. e4 Rh2 34. e5 Qf2# {Mission accomplished.}
