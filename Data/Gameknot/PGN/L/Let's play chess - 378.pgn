[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C71), Noah's ark trap"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Spanish game  } a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. d4 {I'm trying to encourage black to try to play the Noah's Ark trap here. (A famous one - worth looking it up if you don't know it). If he tries that line then I can get some good counterplay - white gets a good game with that line as long as he doesn't fall into the trap!  } Bd7 6. O-O {But black didn't take the bait so I castle kingside and we both continue with our development.  } Nf6 7. dxe5 {Black hasn't castled, and I have, so I want to open up the centre quickly before he gets a chance to finish developing his pieces..  } Nxe5 8. Bb3 Be7 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Re1 Bg4 11. Kh1 {Uh oh. Black has pinned my knight and probably plans to capture on f3, forcing me to play gxf3 and opening up my castled position. I shouldn't have let this happen. No take backs on Gameknot though! So I play Kh1, this will allow me to bring my rook to g1 quickly and hopefully exert some control over the g file.  } Nxf3 12. gxf3 Bh3 13. Rg1 Be6 14. Bh6 {Black has wasted time moving his bishop twice - to h3 and then to e6. A spot of luck for me - it allows me to start taking advantage of the open g file. My open position is starting to work in my favour, instead of black's. The g7 square is very weak for Black now and needs to be defended somehow. 14. ...Ne8 may be the best way to do this, but leads to a very cluttered position for Black.  } Nh5 15. f4 Re8 {Black tries to get his rook out of the firing line - he wants to play g6 without losing the exchange. This leaves the knight on h5 hanging. However, it is difficult to see a safe way to defend the knight, the rook and the g7 square..  } 16. Qxh5 g6 17. Bxe6 {Black is two pieces down and in real trouble now. An interesting position - Black can't recapture the Bishop with 17. ...fxe6 since then 18. Rxg6+ will win: [18. ...hxg6 19. Qxg6+ Kh8 20. Qg7#] or [18. ...Kf7 20. Rg7+ [...Kf8 21. Qf7#] or [...Kf6 21. Qg5#]] or [18. ...Kh8 20. Bg7+ Kg8 21. Bf6+ [...Kf7 22. Qh7+ Kf8 23. Rg8#] or [...Kf8 22. Qh6+ Kf7 23. Qh7+, Kf8 24. Rg8#]]  } Kh8 18. Bxf7 {Black sees the problem and moves his king, unpinning the pawn on g6. But it's looking very bad indeed for black now! He is down two minor pieces and a pawn, his rook is trapped, and his king can't budge an inch either! It's difficult to find a good move for black here. I think best may be Bf8 to try to exchange bishops and take some of the sting out of the attack. But with so much material down even that isn't really going to help. You might have spotted that Black can't just capture the queen with 18. ...gxh5 either. } gxh5 19. Bg7# {Black doesn't notice the mate threat and grabs the queen. Checkmate.  }
