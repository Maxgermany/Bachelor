1. e4 {The King's Pawn Game.} c5 {I respond to his the King's Pawn Game with the, "Cornerstone" of the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Qf3 {?  In this position, he is attempting a, "Scholars Mate" but he has used the queen on his second move, instead of 2.Bc4.  Therefore, I do not know how to respond to this threat, but it might cause problems later in the game.} Nf6 {! I am not sure what to do, so I bring out my knight.  Eventhough it does not chase his queen away, it is still a very good move as it prevents the, "Four Move Trick".  } 3. e5 {In this position, he is attacking my knight and threatening to capture it with 4.exf6, and I make a serious blunder.  That will be mentioned shortly.} Qb6 {?? I should have retreated my knight, but Jack Stockel has told me that it is generally not a good idea to move the knight back.  However, he has also mentioned that there are exceptions, and this was one of them.  In this position, he can still take my knight with exf6.  If that happens, I cannot recapture his knight with my queen, or I will also loose my queen.  I overlooked this feasibility.  } 4. Nc3 {This was not his best move.  As I had mentioned earlier, he could have captured my knight, if he had played exf6, instead.} Ng8 {! At this point, I am not going to give him another chance to take my knight, so I retreat it, "once and for all", as they say. } 5. Bc4 {I do not know why he made this move.} Qg6 {In this position, I am attacking and threatening to capture his c2 pawn with my queen.  He, on the other hand, makes more blunders, so I will be able to play Qxc2.  That will be explained later. } 6. Nd5 {I do not know why he chose this candidate. } Na6 {? I do not know why I made this move, but this does not work, on a regular basis.  That is because, "a knight on the rim is grim", in general.  However, there are exceptions, but this was not one of them.} 7. Nf4 {?? I do not know he made this move, but it turns out to be a big mistake.  Instead, 7.b3, or 7.Qb3, would have been better.  Now, I will play 7...Qxc2, winning his free c2 pawn, so I will be a point ahead.  As I had mentioned earlier, he overlooked this possibility.} Qxc2 8. Bd3 {! In this position, he is attacking and threatening to capture my queen, with 9.Bxc2, but I am not going to allow this.} Qa4 {Therefore, this move is forced.  If I had responded with 8...Qc3, or 8...Qb3 he would force an exchange with 9.Bxa6, bxa6, so I would have two weak a pawns.  } 9. Nd5 {I do not why he chose this candidate because I would not have been able to play Qxf4, due to his queen on f3.} Rb8 {I do not know why I made this move because he would not have been able to play a fork with Nc7+, due to my knight on the rim.} 10. b3 {In this position, he is attacking and threatening to capture my queen, with bxa4, but I am not going to allow this.} Qc6 {Therefore, I retreat my queen.} 11. Bc4 {I do not know why he chose this candidate.} e6 {In this position, I am attacking his knight and threatening to force an exchange, and I do not mind exchanging pieces because I am still ahead.  In addition, this will put me at another strategical advantage, and that will be mentioned shortly.} 12. d3 {?? I do not know why he made this move, but it was not a good choice.  It would have been better if he had retreated his knight.  Instead, I will be three points ahead because I will exchange his knight for my pawn when 12...exd5, 13.Bxd5 are played.} exd5 13. Bxd5 Qb5 {In this position, I am forced to retreat my queen, or I will loose my queen for his LSB.} 14. Bg5 {I do not know why he chose this candidate.} f6 {! In this position, I am attacking and threatening to capture his DSB with 15...fxg5.} 15. Bc4 {! I originally thought that he would retreat his queen, but this move is certainly better.  In this position, he wants to exchange my queen for his LSB, but I am not going to allow that.} Qc6 {Therefore, I must retreat my queen, but this was not my best move because he could have forced a queen exchange.  If that had happened, I would have had two bad c pawns, so Qb6 would have been best.} 16. Bd5 {However, it is a little worse then a queen exchange because he is, again, trying to exchange my queen for his LSB.} Qb5 {Therefore, I am, once again, forced to retreat my queen.  However, Qc7 would have been my best response, as it would have attacked his e5 pawn.  Then he would be forced to play 17.e4.  Instead, he will force an exchange, but I do not mind because I am ahead.  This exchange will occur when 17.exf6, gxf6 are played.} 17. exf6 gxf6 18. Bf4 {In this position, he is attacking and threatening to capture my rook with Bxb8.  If this happens, my rook will be exchanged for his knight.} Nb4 {?? I do not know why I made this move, but it is not good because he could have captured my rook, with Bxb8, as I had mentioned earlier.  } 19. a4 {?? In this position, he is attacking and threatening to capture my queen with 20.axb5, but it is not a good choice.  That is because I will win another free pawn because I will respond with 19...Qxd3.  Once again, he could have Bxb8.} Qxd3 20. Rd1 {?? In this position, he is attacking and threatening to capture my queen with 21.Rxd3, but this is the loosing blunder.  This time, however, Bxb8 would not have been better.  20.Qxd3 would have been his best move.  That way his queen would be exchanged for my queen because I would respond with 20...Nxd3.  However, I would not have a mating pattern against him.  At this point, it is a, "Mate in one", because I will play Nc2#.  BTW, this was a move that I had almost overlooked because I was thinking of the queen exchange with 20...Qxd3.  However, I saw this mating pattern, "in the nick of time", as it is said.  For that reason, this will be a last minute mate, as I had mentioned in the introduction.} Nc2# {This game proves that it is very easy to overlook moves.}
