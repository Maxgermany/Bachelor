1. e4 {Hi everyone!  As I recently played the Latvian against Ion, who kindly e-mailed me the following game, I thought it was worth annotating because Ion handled this opening very well and took full advantage of his opponent's innacuracies.  As for the king hunt at the end of the game, well, in my book, king hunts are always worth annotating!  I hope you have some happy reading here.  Cheers everyone - Joanne} e5 2. Nf3 f5 3. exf5 {3.exf5 ...  Ion stated here "- this turns the thing into a King's Gambit with colours reversed. You'd think this would be OK for White, wouldn't you?"  Yes, this seems Ok, Ion but I think it is how white subsequently plays that turns things down south.} e4 {3...e4  - This move will have a cramping effect on white's game and white must either retreat his knight back to his home square, allow it to be chased around, or block in his lsb.  White chooses the third option.} 4. Qe2 {4. Qe2 - pinning the pawn on e4 but blocking in white's lsb.} d5 5. d4 {5. d4 is possible here because black cannot take the pawn ep because it is illegal!  d4 opens up the line for the dsb to move to g5 with a pin should Ion choose to put his knight there.  He does and the knight gets pinned.} Nf6 6. Ne5 Bxf5 {6. ............. Bxf5 - Ion stated that Black already has a fine game...   Yup, agreed here, maybe a possible alternative to 7. Bg5 was g3 followed by a kingside fianchetto either here or instead of 8. Nxd7.  What do you the jury think?} 7. Bg5 Nbd7 8. Nxd7 Qxd7 9. Bxf6 gxf6 {9. .............. gxf6 - white has split the kingside pawns, I would be tempted to do this I think, but it does open up the g file for the king rook, an occupation of it with said rook will contribute to Ion's victory later on.  The plethora of exchanges on d7 has helped black's development.  White still needs to develop his queen knight and lsb - it will take at least 2 moves to develop this bishop.} 10. f3 O-O-O 11. Nd2 Bh6 {11. ..........Bh6 - black is fully developed and the dsb controls a vital diagonal which will ensure a lethal queen check on e3 later on.  White is still to castle and his lsb is still blocked in.  White is also in grave danger of being pinned on the e file.} 12. fxe4 Rhe8 13. O-O-O {13. 0-0-0?? - drops the exchange in broad daylight!} Bg4 {13................... Bg4 - just look at that skewer - there is no way white can block that lsb's line so the WQ must move and the rook drops next move.} 14. Qb5 c6 15. Qa4 {15. Qa4 - tries to counterattack by threatening a7.} Bxd1 16. Kxd1 Qg4+ {16. ................ Qg4  white has a pawn for the exchange but this is a very nasty queen check and the beginning of an attack on the kingside by Ion.} 17. Nf3 Qf4 {17. .............Qf4 - threatening 18. .............. Qc1 , 19. Ke2 Rxe4.} 18. Ke2 Qe3+ {18.............. Qe3 ?  - Ion stated that "It was only a move or so later I realised that this was unnecessary, merely prolonging the game by 2 moves..."  Yes, Ion, I understand, been there myself in a game I am currently playing against a 1200  player.  I don't think it will affect the result but I think it has delayed it.  That game may well appear in the public annotations as it is a rather unusual opening when it is finished.} 19. Kd1 Qc1+ {19. .............. Qc1 - the threat in my note on move 17 materialises.} 20. Ke2 Rxe4+ 21. Kf2 Qe3+ 22. Kg3 Rg8+ 23. Kh3 Rh4+ {23. ............... Rh4 !! - stunning rook sac to draw the white king up the board!  Note, with a high concentration of force around the enemy king, which I talked about in my own Latvian game with Ion, Ion can afford to sacrifice some heavy material to achieve a checkmate.  See how the white king is now confined to the h file.} 24. Kxh4 Qf4+ {24. .............. Qf4  - closing in, if white blocks the check by playing g4 then Qxg4 is mate.  If white plays his king to h3 then again Qh4 is mate.  Kh5 is white's only legal alternative but it prolongs the game for just one more move.} 25. Kh5 Qg4+ 26. Kxh6 {26. Kxh6 - only legal move, but .........} Qg6# {26. .............. Qg6# - the kiss of death.   Ion stated that it was a nice little king hunt.  I do agree 100%!}
