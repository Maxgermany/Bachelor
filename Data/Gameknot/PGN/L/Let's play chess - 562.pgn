1. e4 b6 2. Bc4 Bb7 3. Qf3 {He is definitely aggressive going after f7 quickly.} Nf6 {Taking advantage of the pin on the e4 pawn.} 4. d3 {Defending the doubly attacked pawn.} e6 {Blocking the c4 Bishop from the f7 square.} 5. Bg5 {A pin.} Be7 {A pin undone.} 6. Nh3 O-O 7. Nc3 {Finishing his development.} h6 8. Bf4 d6 9. Qg3 {Threatens Bxh6 but allows the ensuing fork.} Nh5 10. Qg4 Nxf4 {Stops Bxh6 but allows White to make his h3 Knight more involved in the game.} 11. Nxf4 Nd7 {Bringing the Queen's Knight into the fray.} 12. Nh5 Bg5 {Blocking the mating square.  But as I annotate this I am thinking that Bf6 may have been sufficient.  I can only say that when I made that move I was holding f6 open for my Knight.} 13. h4 {The Bishop has no place safe to go. For some reason I seem blind to Bf6.} Ne5 {So the calvary to the rescue. I seem to have developed some inbred reluctance to putting my Bishop on f6.} 14. Qg3 {Maintaining an eye g7.} Bf6 {Maybe I woke up or maybe I just wanted to see what would happen if the Bishop was here.} 15. O-O-O Ng6 {Perhaps going after his King's pawn with Nxc4 was a better alternative.} 16. f4 Nxh4 {Okay I got it, but already I am wondering if I haven't opened a can of worms.} 17. e5 dxe5 {What was wrong with Nf5 first?} 18. fxe5 Bg5+ 19. Kb1 Nf5 {That check let me get my Knight off of the h file for a while.} 20. Qh3 Ne3 {Perhaps I have survived his sandstorm.} 21. Rde1 Bxg2 {I had waited for quite a while for this Bishop to be able to undertake some action on the long diagonal.} 22. Qh2 Bxh1 23. Qxh1 Nf5 {Again I am wondering if taking out his Bishop and doubling his c pawns would not have been better.} 24. Rg1 {He continues to hammer at me on the g file.} a6 25. Ne4 {This was certainly an unwelcomed move.} Kh8 {To eliminate any unfavorable checks occuring on f6.  My Knight is tasked with blocking his Queen on the h file.} 26. Nxg5 hxg5 27. Nf6+ Nh6 28. Rxg5 Rg8 {I would be more than happy to trade Rooks at this point.} 29. c3 b5 30. Bb3 Qxd3+ {Why not?  Anything I can get now may be helpful later.  True it does allow him the b1-h7 diagonal.} 31. Bc2 Qe3 32. Nxg8 Rxg8 {I did not overlook his Rook at g5; I just felt my Knight was more important.} 33. Rh5 c5 34. Rh3 Qg5 35. a3 f5 {I am seeking a means to extricate my King from the pin.} 36. exf6 e.p. Qxf6 {I did not wish to surrender my Knight's double protection.} 37. Qe4 {Preparing to mate at h7.} Qf1+ {I may end up with doubled pawns but I needed to ease the pressure on my King.} 38. Ka2 {Probably hoping for QxR when the game is over, but as indicated I was just trying to simplify things a little and hoping he would exhange Queens on e4.} Qc4+ 39. Qxc4 {No such luck, doubled pawns it is.} bxc4 {Well the threat at h7 is gone but I still need to get my pieces more into the game.} 40. Re3 {Unpinning the Knight for a pawn I can readily protect?} Re8 41. Re5 {I would have thought he would have gone after the c4 pawn first, in any event I had already crossed off the c pawns.} Ng4 {Bringing my Knight back into play.} 42. Rxc5 e5 43. Rxc4 Nf6 44. Bg6 Ra8 45. b4 Kg8 {Finally.  Moving out of the corner toward the action on the board.} 46. Kb3 Kf8 47. Rc7 {Holding the King to the defense of the g7 pawn.} e4 48. Rc5 {Pulling back to go after the e file pawn?} Ra7 {To enable the Rook to get to the e file on a dark square.} 49. Rc8+ {Taking e7 away from my Rook.} Ke7 50. Rh8 Kd6 51. Rd8+ {Angling for a Bishop versus Knight ending perhaps?} Ke5 52. Rc8 e3 53. Bd3 Kf4 54. Be2 {I am looking at the possibility of having a minor piece and pawn versus three connected pawns in the endgame.  The Knight might be able to hold the fort just long enough for help to arrive.} Kg3 55. Rh8 {Again?  He was here before, probably in better circumstances.} Kf2 56. Rh2+ Ke1 57. Bc4 {Opening e2 for his Rook.} Kd1 {Protects the e file pawn for the moment.} 58. Kb2 {I am not sure I understand this move but I am happy he made it.} Rd7 {I am thinking about Rd2 forking King and Rook.} 59. Rh1+ {So much for that idea.} Kd2 60. a4 e2 61. Rh2 Re7 {I call the question.  } 62. Bxa6 {Time enough for a pawn before answering.} Kd1 {Time to answer!!} 63. Bxe2+ {Okay, Knight and pawn versus pawns.} Rxe2+ 64. Rxe2 Kxe2 65. a5 Nd7 66. Kc2 g5 {My turn to throw a hammer on the g file.} 67. a6 Nb6 {Moving into position to hold the fort.} 68. Kb3 Kd3 {This should slow his pawns just long enough.} 69. b5 g4 70. a7 {Tying the Knight to b6 and a8.} g3 {Just two more squares.} 71. c4 {I had time to capture when his a file pawn was on the sixth rank. Now I will just have to go to a8 when the c pawn attacks.} g2 72. c5 Na8 73. b6 g1=Q {Finally, reinforcements are on the board.} 74. b7 Qb1+ {And they give the Knight the assist that wins the day.}
