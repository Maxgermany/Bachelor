1. d4 {Opponent from Belgium 1.d4 Nf6 - NID?  Checking his past games and as white he likes KIA.  As black he likes French and Indian.  Gotta challenge him again after this.  My theme in this game... central control.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 {Game note: 6...g6 gives me time.  Also want to consider lining my own DSB to take out his on h6.} 7. Nf3 {Game note: 7.Nf3 centre = 7 vs 4 but his fianchetto is potentially strong.  My Qc2 could be well positioned.} Bg7 8. Bf4 {Game note: 8.Bf4 interesting (provokes tactics), counter-intuitive (to k-side development), gains another centre control.} a6 {8…a6 …Nh5 starts showing up in the computer analysis.  Very tricky because there’s the discovered fiancheto behind that.  He finally plays it at move 12.} 9. a4 {Game note: 9.a4 put an end to those tactics.} O-O 10. Be2 {Game note: 10.Bd3 controls a centre square but blocks my Q from 2 centre squares.} Re8 11. Qc2 Bg4 12. O-O Nh5 13. Be3 Nd7 {13…f5 in hindsight.  Checked with computer and it prefers the text by a tiny amount.  Either way I’m compelled to play 14.h3 to mobilize my LSB and trade off my weak N for his bad LSB.} 14. h3 Bxf3 15. Bxf3 Ne5 16. Bxh5 {Game note: 16.Bxh5 Even though I didn’t foresee this or want this, I did it in the spirit of controlling the centre.  If I retreat my LSB then it has no control on the centre.  If I let his h5 N back to f6 then it controls 2 centre squares.  Follow up with 17.f4 (even though, in hindsight, the computer prefers something like Qe2… but not by much) and maybe a R to the middle to continue with the central theme and a break with the e-pawn.  In hindsight I won based on his k-side being opened up by this doubled pawn.} gxh5 17. f4 Ng6 18. Rad1 Rc8 {18…Rc8 in hindsight the computer considers this a small error.  I don’t think I doubted it at the time but I was also watching …Bxc3.} 19. e5 dxe5 20. fxe5 {20.fxe5 the computer likes f5 on account of moving the N and then d6 (+2.20 vs text +0.50).} Rxe5 21. Qf2 Qe7 22. d6 {22.d6? why not 22.Bxc5 but I guess I get it anyway on move 24.} Qe6 23. d7 Rd8 24. Bxc5 Rxd7 25. Rxd7 Qxd7 26. Bd4 {Game note: 26.Bd4 because now my Q and K are lined up in a skewer.  Plus his DSB has great central and long range control.} Rg5 {Game note: 26...Rg5 if he's thinking 27...Qxh3 then Qxf7 wins.  I replied 28.Ne4 because that was my focus but maybe computer line of Qf6+ Kh6 then 29.Ne4.  Kinda the same thing I think except Kg8 sets up the fork.} 27. Bxg7 Kxg7 28. Ne4 Re5 29. Qf6+ Kg8 {Game note: 29...Kg8 sets up a N fork on f6} 30. Qxe5 Nxe5 {Game note: And he fell for it but it's pretty much lost anyway.} 31. Nf6+ {1-0}
