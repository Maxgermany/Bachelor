[Opening "KGD (C31), Falkbeer counter-gambit"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {White play king's gambit. It is one from my favourite openings,.. but when I play as white} d5 {In answer I try to play counter-gambit - to give my opponent a pawn too} 3. exd5 {And my opponent takes it} Qxd5 {I take pawn too, by queen, to else to defend my pawn on e5} 4. fxe5 {white beats pawn e5} Nc6 {I attack on white pawn by knight to help a queen and simply to develop figures} 5. Nc3 {White knight attack black queen} Qxe5+ {Queen takes a pawn on e5 with check. In this position I see some advantage of white side, because black hasn't pawns in the center and its queen may to persecute. But from another side, queen gave a check to opponent's king and can't to persecute at this moment, so black wins a time (tempo)} 6. Qe2 {Queen defends a king} Qxe2+ {Black queen beats white queen, check} 7. Bxe2 {Bishop beats a queen. If you catch sight of - a game became develop on: black attacks - white defends, - but not on the contrary - it is a cost of time} Nd4 {Black knight goes in offensive and menaces by fork on c2} 8. Bd1 {White bishop defends point and pawn c2} Bf5 {Black bishop also makes a pressure on c2} 9. d3 {White defends by advance a pawn on d3, to overlap a line of the charge of black bishop f5} O-O-O {Black makes a long castling, to lock up a king and, first of all, quickly put a rook nearer to the theatre of main actions} 10. Be3 {White bishop, what free from defence of point c2, attacks black knight. And not only!  I see, that also bishop e3 trains on the in-sheltered black pawn a7, if a knight on d4 will leave itself place  } Nxc2+ {And I hesitate to sacrifice my knight to win a tempo. Black knight beats a pawn c2 - check with fork - an offer from what not easily to give up } 11. Bxc2 {White bishop beats black knight on c2} Bxd3 {Black bishop beats white pawn on d3 and wipes out last opportunity to capture a center by pawns in this game. After this move we can see two absolutely open verticals - d and e, - one from what controls by black rook - it is a plus for black side. From another side white has material advantage +1} 12. Bxd3 {White bishop beats on d3} Rxd3 {Black rook beats on d3} 13. Bd2 {Bishop overlaps a line of attack of the rook - for, I think, a long castling} Nf6 {Black knight goes to help } 14. Nf3 {White knight also develops on the point f3 - now, it seem, white can castling as in one so in another side...} Bc5 {But at first black bishop does its out of a second opportunity...} 15. Ne5 {White knight attacks on the rook and at the same time menaces to take a pawn on f7 - it is a fork - to increase material advantage} Re8 {But another black rook catches out to help itself figures - from point e8 rook trusses white knight e5 against king - a main figure on the chessboard.  So I liquidate danger from white knight in the center. Else one comment: it can't to be defended by itself pawns, and bishop on d2 too busy by defense on the another flank  } 16. Bf4 {And just the same, white bishop bucks up to help} g5 {If white takes this pawn, knight e5 will stay without defence} 17. Bg3 {White wants to save a knight at all the costs} Ng4 {But black knight attacks it too} 18. Ne4 {Another knight of white closes king by one and at the same time menaces to take a bishop on c5} Nxe5 {And black knight beats white knight on e5.  On my mind black have advantage, as material (+2) so and position, because white king stayed in center of 1st horizontal and already some moves (after 16.Bf4) can't to castling not in any side. These 18 moves my opponent Bernadet and me had made during 20...25 minutes, and to think on every from its we spent very little time.}
