1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 b6 4. e4 Bb7 5. Bd3 Nbd7 {I am looking to play either the freeing e5 or c5.} 6. O-O e6 {I am already feeling cramped. E6 is a flexible move that takes a wait and see approach to the game. If black wants to play more active he can try d5.} 7. Bf4 h6 {preparing to kick the bishop out of f4.} 8. Qe2 g5 {following through with the plan} 9. Bg3 Nh5 {This is a typical attack against the bishop that messes up white's pawns in front of the castled king.} 10. Ba6 Bxa6 11. Qxa6 Bg7 {I am not in a rush to remove that dark bishop. My aim is to finish my development.} 12. Rad1 Nxg3 13. fxg3 {Normally it is better to capture toward the centre.} O-O {Black is completely finished his development is now ready for the attack.  } 14. Qc4 {Attacking c7} g4 {Driving a wedge into White's position and forcing  him into a cramped game.} 15. Ne1 {This is a very uncomfortable square for the knight to be on. } c5 {here I am seeking to activate my peices and create some breathing room. This move is made possible because of the absence of the knight being on f3.} 16. dxc5 bxc5 {I would say that I can improve on this by playing 16. ...Nxc5. Keeping the c file open and creating a nice advanced post for my knight.  The advantage of Nxc5 is that my knight would be able to jump to D5 were it would dominate the board. I also have prepared a positional trap in case of 17. Rxd6. } 17. Rxd6 {Black gets a lot of compensation for the pawn. } Qe7 {The next few moves are forced} 18. Rd1 Ne5 {I clear the last pawn the obstructs the view of my bishop.} 19. Qe2 c4 {in a span of 4 moves it is now white who is suffering from a lack of space. } 20. Rd2 Rab8 {forcing white to back up even further.} 21. Nd1 {This is very nice for black. All of white's peices are behind the  3rd rank} Bf6 {The bishop is headed for g5 were it will be able to exert more influence over the board.} 22. c3 Bg5 23. Rd4 h5 {This move restricts white } 24. Nc2 Qc5 25. Kh1 {Moving the king of the dangerous dark diagonal.} Rfc8 {Supporting the pawn on C4 } 26. Nce3 a6 27. h3 Kg7 28. hxg4 Nxg4 29. Rxc4 Qb5 30. a4 Qb6 31. Rb4 Qc5 32. Rxb8 Rxb8 33. Nxg4 hxg4 34. Nf2 f5 35. Qxa6 Rxb2 36. Nd3 Qf8 37. Nf4 Bxf4 38. Rxf4 e5 39. Rf1 f4 40. Qe6 Qh8+ 41. Kg1 Rxg2+ {This sets up a rarely used tactic called the windmill. } 42. Kxg2 Qh3+ 43. Kf2 Qxg3+ 44. Ke2 Qe3+ 45. Kd1 Qd3+ 46. Ke1 Qxc3+ 47. Kf2 Qe3+ 48. Kg2 Qg3+ 49. Kh1 {resigned}
