[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence, Beverwijk variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez. THE favourite of mine. Flexible for both attack and defense. It "feels" less classical than the other classical openings.} Nf6 4. O-O Bc5 5. c3 O-O 6. d4 Bb6 {Benelux Variation. The last time I encountered this defense I was mercilessly slaughtered. I need to approach this variation with fresh ideas.} 7. Bg5 h6 {Standard moves.} 8. Bh4 exd4 9. Bxc6 {I remembered my light-squared Bishop was rendered nearly useless with no real targets in the previous loss. I decided to at least remove an active piece. } dxc6 10. e5 {Making use of the pinned Knight.} g5 {The crux of the game! Usual play would have me retreat the Bishop once more. Personally, I would prefer to keep the real estate I earned rather than sell it.} 11. Nxg5 {Nxg5?! I have not seen many games continue this way but felt it was worth a shot to keep pressure on the Knight and open lines to the Black King.} dxc3 12. Qxd8 Rxd8 13. Nxc3 Nd5 {The Knight is finally free...} 14. Nge4 {... but now the Rook is under assault. } Rf8 {I think Black was a little too worried about forked checks when he made this move. 14... Nxc3! should have been played instead. 15. Bxd8 Nxe4 wins the exchange. The response would have been either 15. Nxc3 or bxc3 which then gives the Black Rook luft. } 15. Nxd5 {The pesky Knight must be slain. } cxd5 16. Nf6+ {Finally! The f6 outpost becomes available.} Kg7 17. Nxd5 {Going into the endgame N + B vs 2 B's. The extra pawn may be the edge I'll need.} c6 {A dubious move. It probably would have been better to develop the light-squared Bishop and connect the Rooks with a gain in tempo.} 18. Nxb6 {I remove his better Bishop which was aimed at my King AND compromise his Queenside pawn majority.} axb6 19. a3 Be6 20. Bf6+ Kh7 21. Rfd1 {Grabbing the open d-file.} Rfg8 22. Rd2 {Covering the 2nd rank and protecting poorly supported pawns. At this point I was wishing I could get to the 7th rank instead and cause even more mayhem.} Bb3 {A gift move!} 23. Rd7 {7th rank achieved!} Rab8 {Note that 2 pieces are being held hostage by 1 Rook for fear of losing more pawns. Materially, I am up 1 pawn. Functionally, I am up almost a full piece.} 24. g3 Rg4 25. f4 {All Black's pieces are now contained. Also note Black's light-squared Bishop has no meaningful targets.} b5 26. Re1 b6 27. e6 {The push.} Rgg8 {The retreat.} 28. Rxf7+ {The fall.} Kg6 29. Be7 {No checkmate yet but the walls are closing in. Careful moves from here to the end are needed.} Rb7 30. f5+ Kh5 31. Re4 Rg4 {Pesky Rook! Confound it!} 32. Re3 Bd5 {Saves his Bishop.} 33. h3 Rxg3+ {I think Black had lost all hope by now. He probably should have played 33... Rxe7 34.Rxe7 Rg8} 34. Rxg3 Be4 35. Bf6 {The next 3 moves were all conditional, set by Black.} Rxf7 36. exf7 Bxf5 37. f8=Q Bxh3 {Checkmate is obvious.} 38. Qf7# {I hope you were able to take away some useful lessons from this game.}
