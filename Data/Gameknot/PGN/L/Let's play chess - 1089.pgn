1. e4 {FALKBEER COUNTER-GAMBIT  White claims the center and opens lines for the King's Bishop and Queen} e5 {The most popular answer to the King's opening, since this movement keep certain simmetry in the center, which is possitive for the black side} 2. f4 {White  response with a King's Gambit. It sacrificies his f pawn to launch a quick attack on the black king. The problem is that when his attack is over, his defence turns weak.} d5 {Falkbeer Counter-Gambit: I love this response for blacks, because it allows to get out both bishops} 3. exd5 {White accepts the gambit pawn} exf4 {Until this move, things flow as usual} 4. Nf3 {Now, the game has turned into Abbazia defence, modern variation, which (IMAO) it offers a wider range of oportunities for the black side than for the white one} Nf6 {Now, there is several ways to follow the gambit properly, I chose this variant to go on the attack, though perhaps the more logical way of doing it would be e4 or even c6} 5. c4 {White likes to protect his doubled pawn. Besides, he opens a way to get out his Queen and menace blacks' King} c6 {Now black decides follow with Marshall/Nimzowitsch Counter-Gambi offering another pawn and covering the King from the Queen menace } 6. dxc6 {White break his doubled pawn column and opens a wide area in black pawns line} Nxc6 {Of course this is the most natural response, since if bxc6, black leaves a pawn without any effective defence} 7. d4 Bb4+ {The black attack begins...} 8. Bd2 {Bd2! White tried to defence. He could choose among this movement or Nc3. } Qe7+ {Black's attack goes on} 9. Be2 Bg4 {Black's attack III} 10. O-O {0-0! IMAO, This is the best way to get rid of annoying Black pieces.} O-O {Okay, I had a doubt here, I wasn't sure if 0-0 or 0-0-0. I felt more weakness in the other side, so I got the short one. It is true that this one, doesn't allow me to be more agressive on attack...} 11. Bxb4 {Bxb4. Perhaps the white side should have continued with d5} Qxb4 {Now, the final attack is served} 12. Qc2 Bxf3 13. Bxf3 Nxd4 14. Qc1 {Qc1?? } b5 {Ok, this movement is a tricky one, but wheather White realised or not, Black side still has huge chances to punish the white defence} 15. Bxa8 {... He didn't notice anyway} Ne2+ {Game over.  Cute, isn't it?}
