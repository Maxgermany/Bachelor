1. e3 {this was a game played by my older brother ( no im not bias )... i thought this was an interesting game........hope you enjoy my insightful (maybe) comments. } d5 { d4} 2. c3 Nf6 3. Qf3 c5 {standard opening, pawn to e6 is next} 4. h3 {h3} e6 5. d3 {nivk moving pawns one space at a time} Bd6 {this move opens up for kg8 (castle for later on)} 6. e4 {nivk persisting with pawn movement} d4 {this moves aims to open up C file if pawn is taken} 7. h4 e5 {consolidating d4, no attacks planned yet } 8. a3 {more pawn development} Nc6 {move to further develop and maybe consolidate d4} 9. Nd2 {nivk low on options for knight movement as c3 and a3 are both occupied} Qc7 {continueing to release pieces} 10. b4 {nivk thrusting pawns forward. However, c3 is left open... } dxc3 {d4xc3} 11. Nb3 {moving knight away from trouble...nivk is on the backfoot(slightly)} cxb4 {black advancing pawns} 12. Bg5 Be7 {protection move } 13. Qg3 {looking to attack if black castles... not going to happen} Be6 {force knight to retreat to c1 } 14. Nc1 Nd4 {looking for c2 (check) then a1. if white moves king to (d1 in order to not lose rook) then it is pawn c2... forces Ke1 then Qc3 wins the game for black  } 15. f4 {nivk did well to spot the checkmate and again advances pawn.......} Bg4 {Bg4 is a crutial move in this game...tberk1  is looking for Nc2.. forces Kf2 then Qc5.. check, forces Qe3 to cover king..then checkmate} 16. fxe5 {a good move here opening up the bishop defence on e3 } Nc2+ {king forced to f2} 17. Kf2 Qb6+ {hoping for Be3 } 18. Be3 {Ne3 is next..... nivk is scrambling to defend} Nxe4+ {black realises his knight would be eaten later... so he makes a pawn from this } 19. dxe4 Nxe3 {Ne3... i told you.... white must take otherwise next move they have lost by Nc2} 20. Qxe3 {queen is trapped} Bc5 {hard to see a comeback from here} 21. Bb5+ {pointless... i think..but it allows king to take blacks bishop when the queen is taken} Qxb5 22. axb4 Bxe3+ {and now the games pase slows down as white has a long way to come back from} 23. Kxe3 {material value bishop =3 queen=9 you do the math..} Qxe5 {this is where the game is in blacks control and it tapers out from here} 24. Nd3 {attacking the queen } Qg3+ 25. Nf3 O-O {castle for unkwown reason.. should have gone Qg2} 26. Nc5 {hmmm.. Qg2 next move?} Qxg2 {yep} 27. Raf1 {defending their horse at all costs but black can move Bxf3} Bxf3 {its soon over} 28. Rhg1 {good move but Qe2 is open} Qe2+ 29. Kf4 {king is in the open.....on the runaway} Bg2 {impending resignation} 30. Kg3 {this is the 2nd last move before resignation} Bxf1 {a well planned game....... next for black would be Qe3 then if white moves to h2 its over...however if they go to g4 then Bh3 forces Kh5 then a simple Pg6 forces Rg6 then Pg6 again wins black the game.... if you got to this point u r probalby already sick of my un educated comments....thanks for reading}
