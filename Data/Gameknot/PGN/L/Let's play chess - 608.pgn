[Opening "two knights defence (C57), Lolli attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {The Giuoco Piano. I was expecting the Ruy Lopez.} Nf6 4. Ng5 {My opponent chooses an aggressive line. Proper defense will cut the attack off at the pass.} d5 {The Bishop's diagonal has to be cut. This is the best way to do it.} 5. exd5 Nxd5 {The Pawn exchange leaves me with the stronger center, for now.} 6. d3 Be7 {I prepare to castle. But my opponent has a surprise in store.} 7. Nxf7 {I do not think this attack is sound. It does create tricky complications, and in an over-the-board situation, especially in a blitz-type game, it could be a useful line to try. If Black doesn't have time to think, a blunder could emerge.} Kxf7 {Forced.} 8. Qf3+ {I think White was counting on this move winning the Knight on my Q4. } Ke6 {My opponent may have overlooked that this response saves the piece.} 9. Nc3 {Applying more pressure...} Ncb4 {...and I guard the Knight again. White can't drive away the guard with 10 P-QR3?? because 0f 10...NxP ch!, winning a Rook.} 10. O-O {This stops the Knight fork.} c6 {However, with the Pawn now guarding the pinned Knight, I can lose at most a Pawn in the ensuing exchanges, if my opponent forces the issue.} 11. Bb3 Rf8 {I try to drive the Queen.} 12. Qg4+ Kd6 13. Qxg7 {White succeeds in winning a Pawn...} Bf5 {...but allows me to free my position.} 14. a3 Na6 15. d4 {The position has stabilized. Now I need to exchange off as many pieces as possible to prevent tactical complexities rendering my material advantage useless.} Nxc3 16. Qxe5+ {White attempts to keep the game tactical.} Kd7 17. bxc3 Qc7 {I offer the exchange of Queens.} 18. Bf4 Qxe5 {By permitting this exchange, White has allowed me to reach the position I want: an endgame where my extra piece will shine. With more pieces to use, I should be able to win back some of the Pawns.} 19. dxe5 Nc7 {This Knight can now get back into play.} 20. Rad1+ Ke8 21. a4 Rd8 {Offering another exchange.} 22. e6 {This mistake simply costs White a Pawn.} Nxe6 23. Bxe6 Bxe6 {With the game simplifying rapidly and White's weak, isolated Q-side Pawns looking like prime targets, I feel a win is within sight.} 24. Bc7 Rxd1 {Another mistake by White. He should avoid piece exchanges at all costs.} 25. Rxd1 Bf5 26. Rd2 Kf7 {I try to get my King away from White's Rook. White can do little but wait for me to maneuver.} 27. a5 Kg8 28. h3 Bf6 {The power of the two Bishops is felt. White cannot defend both isolated QBP's.} 29. c4 {Temporarily saving the Pawn.} Re8 30. c5 Bc3 {Now I drive the Rook and win the Pawn on White's QB2.} 31. Rd1 Bxc2 32. Rc1 Re1+ {Forcing another piece exchange. White's Rook will vanish.} 33. Rxe1 Bxe1 34. a6 {This speeds White's doom. However, the position is lost for White in any case.} bxa6 {Now the QRP will march to victory.} 35. Bb8 a5 36. Bxa7 a4 37. Bb6 Bc3 {The final blow, guarding QR8 and preventing the Bishop from stopping the Pawn.} 38. Kf1 a3 {White resigns.}
