1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 c5 {This ends up as a Benoni-type pawn structure for Black.} 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 Be7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. h3 a6 9. a4 {Preventing b5, which makes Black's job of getting untangled much more difficult.} Nbd7 10. Bf4 Qb6 11. Qc2 Qd8 {Qb6 just wasted a tempo and helped White develop.} 12. Bd3 b6 13. O-O Bb7 14. Qe2 Re8 15. Rad1 h6 16. Rfe1 Bf8 {Black has very few useful moves.  Quite a few possible moves simply make the position worse.} 17. Qc2 Ne5 18. Nxe5 dxe5 19. Be3 Bd6 20. Ne2 Qc7 21. Ng3 Bc8 22. Be2 Bd7 23. b3 b5 {This move ultimately drops a pawn.} 24. axb5 axb5 25. Rda1 Ra5 26. Rec1 Rea8 27. Rxa5 Qxa5 28. Bxc5 Bxc5 29. Qxc5 Rc8 30. Qe3 Rxc1+ 31. Qxc1 Qb4 32. Qc2 Qe1+ 33. Bf1 b4 {Making the pawn immune from White's light-square Bishop.} 34. Qd3 Qc1 35. Qc4 Qe1 {Exchanging Queens just makes White's endgame easy.} 36. Ne2 Qd2 37. Nc1 Nxe4 38. Qxe4 Qxc1 39. Qxe5 Qc5 40. Bc4 Kf8 {Black is much worse.  White's passed pawn should decide the game.} 41. d6 {A shocking tactical oversight.} Qxe5 {White resigned here, after an otherwise better-played game.}
