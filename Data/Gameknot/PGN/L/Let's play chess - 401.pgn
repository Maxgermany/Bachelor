1. e4 {This is one of my first games in GK  typical e4 starting} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {i usually use italian opening} Qf6 {but playing with Queen? i wasnt expecting that} 4. d3 {opening the way of my bishop} Na5 {i think this is a bad move throwing away your Knight outside of battle area} 5. Bg5 Qb6 6. Nc3 {using Queen in early stage gives me advantage of improving my weapons} f6 7. Be3 Qd6 8. O-O a6 9. Ba4 b5 10. Bb3 {trying to force back my bishop} Bb7 11.
