[Opening "Modern defence (A41)"]

1. d4 {My standard.} d6 {This response isn't all that common and there is very little variation in what you see.} 2. c4 {Sticking to the gambit.} g6 {My opponent decides to go into the modern defense.} 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bg5 {Normally one would play e4 but I wanted to get the bishop outside of the pawn chain so I would have the option of e3.} O-O 6. e4 {Though Bg5 is not often seen in the modern defense, it is a typical position for it. I'm fully willing to play into his book.} Nh5 {? Breaking the pin but taking the knight out of the center. I immediatly see the opporutnity to capture there with the light bishop and after the exchange taking the pawn.} 7. Be2 {I set my idea in motion. Also in my head is to push one of my pawns.} Nd7 {He realizes this and protects c5 and e5. However this blocks in the light bishop.} 8. Be3 {Avoiding a threat on f6 and helping attack c5.} b6 {Defending c5 and planning to fianchetto the bishop.} 9. d5 {Pushing the pawn that the knight doesn't attack.} Nhf6 {Breaking the rule of not moving the same piece twice in the opening. Perhaps he feared an e5 pawn push, this was the last of the three pawns I was going to push.} 10. O-O Ng4 11. Bd4 {I would rather trade off bishops and place my knight on a strong square.} Nge5 12. Nxe5 Nxe5 13. f4 {I normally hate pushing my king pawns but I can control the center this way, restrict the knight, and trade off bishops.} Nd7 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 {I trade off bishops like I wanted to, this opens up his king early and I plan of taking advantage of that. I already envision my queen wreaking havoc in the center on d4.} 15. Bg4 {I launch my kingside attack and place pressure and further restriction on Black's light bishop.} Nf6 16. Bxc8 {? Breaking the rule of not trading a good bishop for a poor one. This will serve me well on my assault of f7.} Qxc8 17. e5 {The assault gains momentum and starts to get dangerous. I plan to remove the knight from protection and free up the f file.} dxe5 18. fxe5 Nd7 19. Qd4 {Threatening a discovered check with e6! and Black loses his knight.} Kg8 20. e6 {I play it anyway, placing pressure on both the knight and f7. This move will be key to my assualt.} Nf6 {Blocking off my assault on f7. Better than fxe6 dxe6 with even more attacking opportunities for White.} 21. Rae1 {I plan to trade off knights.} Qb7 {Connecting the rooks.} 22. Ne4 Nxe4 23. exf7+ {!! The attack comes to fruition and the kingside is destroyed.} Rxf7 24. Rxf7 Kxf7 25. Qxe4 {Threatening e7 and maintaining the option of Rf! .} c5 {Black must sacrifice the c pawn to protect the much more important e pawn. I will use this as insurance later.} 26. dxc6 e.p. Qc7 27. Rf1+ Kg7 28. Qe6 {Threatening Rf7 } Rc8 {Trying to take away my insurance pawn that makes simplifying unappealing to my opponent.} 29. Rf7+ Kh6 {The best move, Kh8 is met by 30.Rxe7 Qxc6 31.Qf7 Rg8 32.Qxh7#} 30. Qe3+ Kh5 31. Rxh7+ Kg4 32. Qf3+ Kg5 {The last three moves for black were forced and the culmination of my attack was to come on the next move.} 33. h4# {I felt that this game was one of my best legitimate attacking games ever and I was never concerned. Completly confortable and satisfying victory.}
