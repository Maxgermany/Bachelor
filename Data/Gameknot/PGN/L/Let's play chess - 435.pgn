[Opening "QGD Slav (D30)"]

1. d4 {A nice game I've exchanged two minor pieces for a rook and a pawn, and achieved some advantage at some points, even captured another pawn, but then black could get a fortress and so do I, I've kept pushing my passed pawn and the game went on naturally until a forced draw by repetition, black's only chance to stop the pawn...So I offered a draw which was accepted. Also remarkable was the novelty 7...Be7! presented by black which consisted in an improvement over the previous game played until then Bogoevski Jani (MKD) - Mitkov Nikola (MKD), Struga (Macedonia), 2007!} d5 2. c4 e6 {QGD Slav (D30)} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. a3 h6 6. e3 a6 7. Qc2 {avoiding the exchange of queen in case the centre gets open, while adding a defender to c4 pawn and to the e4 square} Be7 {N in the game Bogoevski Jani (MKD) - Mitkov Nikola (MKD), Struga (Macedonia), 2007; 0-1 was tried 7...Bd6, but two moves latter black moved the bishop to e7 losing a tempo, so Be7 can be considered an improvement over that game} 8. b3 {to keep my pawn presence in the centre in case black decides to exchange pawns} dxc4 {and he does exchange} 9. bxc4 O-O 10. Bb2 {aimed at the castled king and also improving my defence of d4 when and if black decides to challenge my pawn centre} Na5 {with an eye on b3 and the other on c4} 11. Be2 {developing the final piece and making possible the short castle} c5 {an expected challenge of my pawn centre} 12. Na4 {mimics blacks knight with an eye on c5 and the other on b6, but black still has b5, which I expect to be his next move} b5 {?! after Nxc5 Nxc4 Bxc4 black will retain the bishop pair but has the worst pawn structure with three pawn islands and a hanging pawn} 13. Nxc5 Nxc4 14. Bxc4 {after some exchanges now if Bxc5 I'll have an extra passed pawn after dxc5 and Qxc4} bxc4 {black sacrifices a pawn to deny me of my bishop pair} 15. O-O {connecting rooks and protects my king} Rb8 16. Ne5 {aimed at c4} Bb7 17. f3 {temporarily weakens e3 but then it can also support a pawn push to e4 and blocks the b7 bishop and removes some options from black's knight on f6, namely Ne4 and Ng4} Qc7 {black queen is hanging, so I'll play Rfc1 to support the capture of c4} 18. Rfc1 Bxc5 19. dxc5 {and black facing the loss of his c4 pawn gives back the bishop pair to get the "invested" pawn} Qxc5 20. Bd4 {improving my position with tempo} Qe7 {now I thought a while about Qxc4 with the idea of playing Bc5, but I lack one tempo, due to Rfc1 attacking my queen before I can play Bc5 and would be black improving his position with tempo } 21. Nxc4 Nd7 {maybe with the idea of playing f6-e5....} 22. e4 Ba8 23. Qc3 Rfc8 24. Bxg7 {So I'll exchange two minor pieces for a rook and a pawn, and with my queen on the centre I might get some chances of promoting another pawn} Rxc4 25. Qxc4 Kxg7 26. Qc7 Kh7 27. Rcd1 Rb7 {forced, but black's pieces have bad coordination so maybe I can force some win here} 28. Qc8 Ra7 {forced, because Rb8?? leads to Qxd7 Qxd7 Rxd7 +-} 29. Rab1 Kg7 30. Kh1 {avoiding some check on the g1-a7 diagonal} a5 31. Qc3+ {? bad move (I only realised it a couple of move latter) now white plays e5 and can shift his queen from g5 and e7 and achieves a fortress, the outcome of this game should be a draw now...} e5 {! exactly } 32. h3 {? I was worried about my last rank safety, but this loses a precious tempo, although the result shouldn't vary much without 32.h3} a4 33. Rb4 Nf8 34. Rc4 Qg5 35. Rc5 Re7 {? Ng6 defending e5 and aimed at f4 is better, but black is putting on a defence now, and already has better coordination of his pieces} 36. Ra5 {now the a pawn falls} Bb7 {expected} 37. Rxa4 Ne6 38. Ra7 Nf4 39. Qb2 Kh7 40. Kh2 h5 41. Rb1 Ba6 42. Rxe7 {Rxa6?? loses to Rb7 even if Rb6 then Rxb6 and I can't play Qxb6 as is mate in one} Qxe7 43. a4 Qg5 44. Qf2 h4 45. Kh1 {now black can force a draw... I've placed some conditional moves Nd3 Qa7 Nf4 Qf2... shifting the queen and knight between f2-a7 and d3-f4 respectively } Bc4 46. a5 Nd3 47. Qa7 {aimed at f7, so black can defend it or attack my king's position with Qg3} Qg3 48. Rf1 {now black can again force a draw... I've put some conditionals regarding that chance} Nf4 49. Rf2 Kg7 50. Qe3 Bf1 51. Qd2 {only move to keep the g2 pawn... I've sent a draw offer, let's see if my opponent accepts it, as the game is dead draw, black can't enter my fortress, nor can I enter his, also despite being two pawns up, I can't force a promotion.}
