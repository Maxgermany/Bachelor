1. d4 {hello this is going to be my first annotation and the first time that i played budapest gambit don't know if i followed main line so i'd like a few comments on my play } Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 {i was kinda hoping he'll play Bf4 followed by Qe7 threatening Qb4  and attacking c-pawn and b pawn} Bc5 {developing with tempo} 5. e3 Nc6 {attacking e pawn twice} 6. Be2 O-O {no need to take it yet} 7. O-O Re8 {now i like my position here i developed 3 pieces while my opponent developed 2 of them and my rook is controlling semi-opened file } 8. Nc3 Ncxe5 9. h3 Nxf3+ 10. Bxf3 Ne5 11. a3 {? maybe preparing b4...} Nxf3+ 12. Qxf3 {white has h1-a8 diagonal under control and i'll need a few moves to free my bishop} c6 {couldn't think of anything better...} 13. b4 {here's the b4 i mentioned :)} Bb6 14. Bb2 d6 {and my bishop is free at last} 15. Qg3 {now i have to deal with that g7 pawn if he moves the knight, there's a checkmate threatening} g6 {done :)} 16. Ne4 {well, he moved it but luckily for me in the wrong place blunder that cost him the game } Rxe4 {why not? :)} 17. Qf3 {i'd rather play Rfd1} Rxc4 {free pawn me like :)} 18. Bf6 Qf8 {i didn't want to block my bishop again with Qd7and this way with my queen on f8 no need to worry about potential checkmate} 19. Rfd1 {little late now...} d5 20. Qg3 Be6 21. f4 {weakens his king for no reason and look at that weak pinned e-pawn} Re8 22. Kh2 {freeing the pawn... but i think white is just losing time} Bf5 {attacking e-pawn twice} 23. Qh4 {again - ?} Bxe3 24. Bg5 {defending the pawn} d4 25. Bh6 Qd6 26. Kh1 d3 27. Ra2 d2 {didn't want to exchange bishops and ease the pressure} 28. g4 Qd5+ {and a nice combination leads to resining} 29. Kh2 Bxf4+ 30. Bxf4 Re2+ {he resigns because of: 31. Qg2#  the thing that allowed me to win this game is blunder on move 16  please leave a comment, especially for first few moves thanks ;) have a nice day/week/month  }
