1. d4 {This is a game that i played with a player that had less points than me...Also i don't like d4 for opening but that happened unfortunately so i had to fight for the game...I have won in the past as black games that started with d4, but it's an opening a don't like that much......} d5 {d5 as a reply...} 2. c4 {c4 then...} dxc4 {And i'm taking the pawn..} 3. e4 {Then i expected him play Nc3 but he played e4 instead..} e5 {i replied e5...} 4. d5 {Then he played d5 and he built a strong centre...} Nf6 {Now i'm developing my pieces...} 5. Bg5 {And he's pushing me with his bishop...} h6 {h6 is typical...} 6. Bxf6 {He took it then...} Qxf6 {And i'm taking the bishop with my queen...Also a good position for my queen though i still didn't finish the development...} 7. Bxc4 {He's taking the pawn and equalize...} Bc5 {i'm trying to push the f2 pawn...} 8. f3 {A bad movement i think as he's blocking his knight....} Bg4 {Now i think i'm fine with the my piece's development and i'm pushing f2 and f3 squares as well...At least it's a phenomenal pressure...} 9. h3 {h3 is a logical reply... But the king's side is quite disorganized...} Bd7 {Still his pawns are staying strong in the centre and i'm moving back the bishop..} 10. Nc3 {He's developing the knight but the king's side setting is feeling awkard and the g2 square is weak and unprotected...} Qg5 {So my target is the g2 pawn...} 11. Nge2 {At least to save the rook...} Qxg2 {i'm taking the g2 pawn..The damage of the bad development in the beginning is made and it's clear now his position is weak..} 12. Rf1 {Logical movement...} Qxh3 {i'm taking the pawn...i didn't finish my development or castled as i guess i'm doing quite good attacking job...} 13. Bb5 {He's trying to push the bishop but still his defence is in mess...} Be3 {I've got a plan now, disable the opponent's king...This was a good move that helped me later checkmate...} 14. Bxd7+ {Check but in fact no fear...} Nxd7 {The knight did his job and i can still castle...} 15. Nb5 {That would be nice but my main concern is attack and not the defence...So i'm taking the risk somehow not to castle but to attack in the opponent's king...} Qh4+ {Check...He had two options but the one with the rook would immediately checkmated...So the other one was better...I don't know why but he ignored to organize his defence and his queen was not participating or helping him at all...} 16. Ng3 {Logical reply again...} Qxg3+ {Bye bye knight and check again...} 17. Rf2 {He played the worst movement...} Qxf2# {And then checkmated of course... Hope you enjoyed and liked the game...Wait for comments...}
