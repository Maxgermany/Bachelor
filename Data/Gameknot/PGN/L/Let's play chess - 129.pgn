1. e4 e6 2. d4 c5 {I've been experimenting with this setup for Black.  White expects the French or Pirc and gets something completely different.  It often transposes into an open Sicilian.} 3. d5 exd5 4. exd5 d6 {In this case, it has transposed into a Benoni structure.} 5. Nc3 a6 6. a4 h6 7. Nf3 Nf6 8. h3 Be7 9. Bf4 O-O 10. Be2 Bf5 11. Bd3 Bxd3 12. Qxd3 {The challenge in this structure is to figure out something useful to do with the Nb8.} Nbd7 13. O-O Re8 14. Ne2 Nf8 15. Ng3 Ng6 {The N is happier on g6.} 16. Bd2 Qc7 17. c4 Bf8 18. Bc3 Nd7 19. Nf5 Nde5 20. Nxe5 Nxe5 21. Qg3 {White tries to gang up on g7.} Kh7 {Removing the pin for now.} 22. f4 Ng6 23. h4 {Aggressively trying to push the Ng6 away, making g7 vulnerable again.} Qd7 {White Nf5 is also loose, even though it is on a great square.} 24. Qg4 {White resigned here, I think prematurely.  Black can play Ne7, but White can defend with Ne3, avoiding the loss of a piece.  Black can gain a pawn with Nxh4, but I don't think White's game is lost.  On the contrary, White has more space and better pieces.  Perhaps I am missing something, but I was surprised by the win.}
