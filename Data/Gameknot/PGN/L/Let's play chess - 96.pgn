1. e4 {Opens Diagonals to Queen And Bishop} d5 {immediately challenges White's weak pawn that is not undefended by no pieces.} 2. exd5 {white challenges my intention to take with the queen so white maybe gets lead in development in exchange for weaker center} Nf6 {I am willing to sacrifice an pawn to commit White to weakening the structure of the pawns and I will get a lead in development and take advantage of White's horrible position} 3. Nf3 {white does not want any of that so just develops } Qxd5 {I have a better center and more solid pawn structure, but White can attack my queen with Nc3 or c4 after d4} 4. Be2 {maybe playing for a draw?} Bg4 {I develop aggressively and cause White to struggle, usually it is Black who struggles, not White} 5. O-O {White castles into a devastating attack} Nc6 {getting another re-enforcement to the kingside} 6. d3 {I'm not sure if White can recover, but maybe his dark-squared bishop can help his position in shambles} O-O-O {developing incredibly aggressively, White has no chance.} 7. Bg5 {White tries to get the dark-squared bishop to help the situation but he only loses the valuable re-enforcement} Bxf3 {BRILLIANCY ALERT GENIUS ALERT KING ALERT PROPHET ALERT!!!!! I have captured the defender of the bishop, now White might be scratching his head wondering how he is left with a deficit, not understanding that some people are just on another level} 8. Bxf3 {recaptures but....} Qxg5 {BOOM!!!! now I have extra knight} 9. Bxc6 {takes to weaken my pawn structure, but it does not matter, I win} bxc6 {no pieces to attack exposed king} 10. Nc3 {I have extra dark-squares bishop and I use it to attack the h2 square and win the game} e6 {planning Bd6-h2} 11. a3 {maybe white thought I was going after c3 knight so he stops my move} Bd6 {but he doesn't see that his kingside is lost} 12. g3 {blocks my bishop's path to the strong} h5 {getting another re-enforcement to attack the weak} 13. Ne4 {trades but to no avail I win not complex but obvious} Nxe4 {and takes} 14. dxe4 {and takes} Bxg3 {and reveals the rook to the queen so White does not take my bishop} 15. Qf3 {but I win more easy} Bd6+ {back} 16. Qg2 {block} Qf4 {aim for h2} 17. f3 {do not understand} Rh6 {aiming Rook g6 to win the queen} 18. Kh1 {prevents it} Rg6 {attacks} 19. Qe2 {gets away} Qxh2+ {I was getting really sick tired of white missing my attacks so I just trade queens to make win more obvious} 20. Qxh2 {forced} Bxh2 {queens off board} 21. Kxh2 {I lost the extra bishop but I have pawns to win} Rd2+ {rook to d2 check attacks c2 and x-ray b2} 22. Kh3 {a role} Rgg2 {I win with awfully awesome process} 23. Rfh1 {he blocks} g5 {but i get checkmate} 24. b4 {he moves} Rgf2 {and i plan checkmate} 25. Kg3 {he stops it} Rfg2+ {was not a mistake} 26. Kh3 {same position but no mistake} Rdxc2 {takes I am winning more} 27. a4 {he moves} h4 {now I threaten mate and I win} 28. b5 {he moves} Rg3# {ALERT I JUST PASSED THE BRILLIANCY TEST I HAVE BEEN PROMOTED TO CHANCELLOR}
