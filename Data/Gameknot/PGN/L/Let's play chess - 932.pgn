1. e4 {This is my third attempt at an annotation. It's a short game and I hope quite an interesting one} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {A good spot for the bishop and also allows black to castle} Nf6 4. Ng5 {An early attack threatening to fork my queen and rook} Bc5 {D5 is possibly a better counter.  Gameknot describes this as two knights defence, Wilkes Barre (Traxler) variation} 5. Nxf7 {Gains a rook however there is an interesting counter to the early attack from white as we will see} Bxf2+ 6. Kf1 {If white takes the bishop with his king N e4 could pose some interesting options for black, as blacks queen can come into play} Qe7 {forced} 7. Nxh8 d5 8. Bxd5 {Although this looks strong as the bishop is now difficult to remove from the centre it's a fatal mistake for white} Bg4 {Now the white queen must fall} 9. Kxf2 Bxd1 10. Rxd1 {Although white is ahead in material he has a lot of peices undeveloped and his king is exposed. I also still have the option to castle which will force him to waste a move on the knight} Ng4+ 11. Kg1 {This appears to get the white king into a safer position, however my queen is well placed to apply serious pressure} Qc5+ 12. Kh1 {KF1 loses immediately, I can't help but think that the best option for white here would have been d4} Nf2+ {Forking the rook however I now have some more classic moves lined up} 13. Kg1 Nh3+ 14. Kh1 {forced} Qg1+ 15. Rxg1 Nf2# {Thanks for reading}
