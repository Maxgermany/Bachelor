1. e4 c5 2. c4 g6 3. f4 {Odd opening.  This will be taken advantage of.} d6 4. d3 Bg7 5. h3 e5 6. Qd2 {Bad move by White.  Loses a pawn on the sixth move.} exf4 7. Qxf4 Bh6 {White got greedy, and now has to lose material.} 8. Qf2 Bxc1 9. Qc2 Qh4+ 10. Ke2 Bg4+ 11. Nf3 {His Bishop is hemmed in, his Knight is pinned, and his King is vulnerable.

Qd3 fxe4 {The final push.} 22. fxe4 Nxe4 {He doesn't want a triple fork.  I'm probably going to need one of those for my Porterhouse steak, perhaps he can lend it to me?} 23. Kc2 Nf2 {Where to move the Queen?  There are no good spots.} 24. Qd2 d3+ {White Resigns. If Kc1 Bf4 wins the Queen.  If Kb1 White loses both rooks.}
