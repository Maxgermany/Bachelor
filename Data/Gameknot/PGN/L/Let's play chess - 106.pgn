1. e4 b6 {I've been experimenting with b6.  } 2. d4 Bb7 3. Bd3 e6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Qe2 h6 {Not sure if h6 is best.  On the other hand, Bg5 would be uncomfortable and essentially prevents Black from playing Bxc3.} 7. Bd2 O-O 8. a3 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 {Now Bxc3 and the recapture with the B creates a bad piece.} d6 10. O-O Nbd7 11. e5 dxe5 {I looked at Nd4 which seems preferable to me from a positional point of view.  But it seems to allow Qe4, which might lead to more weaknesses.} 12. dxe5 Ne8 13. Rfd1 Qe7 14. Be4 {By offering the Bishop exchange White gives up their best B and reduces their ability to launch a Kingside attack.} Bxe4 15. Qxe4 Rb8 16. Rd2 Nc5 17. Qe2 Na4 18. Bb4 c5 19. Bc3 Nxc3 20. bxc3 {Now White is saddled with a slight pawn weakness.} Nc7 21. c4 {I thought this was a good move by White, reducing the scope of Black's N.} Rbd8 22. Rad1 Rxd2 23. Rxd2 Rd8 24. Rxd8+ Qxd8 25. Qd3 {This is also, I thought, a smart exchange for White.  Black can avoid the exchange but must give up the open file.  If Black exchanges, White is able to remove the doubled pawns.} Qxd3 26. cxd3 Kf8 {A draw was offered and accepted.}
