[Opening "English (A25), Sicilian reversed"]

1. c4 e5 {I always use this opening. Of course though, c5 may have been better.} 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. a3 {Even though the ratings between the two players are just numbers, my opponent was still quite stronger and more experienced than me, so I had to be ready for moves that made no sense to me, like this one. } d6 {I give more protection to the e5 pawn.} 4. e3 g6 5. Nf3 Bg4 {I constantly do this move.} 6. h3 {I'm sure you all know what happens next.} Bxf3 7. Qxf3 {I wasn't completely expecting the queen.} Bh6 8. b4 f5 {Both sides are moving forward.} 9. Be2 e4 {My pawns have good structure on the king-side.} 10. Qg3 Bg7 {Going for the knight.} 11. Bb2 {He protects it some more, so I hold off for a bit.} a6 12. f3 Bxc3 {Now I attack.} 13. Bxc3 {And a mistake. If I had realized that my move would put my rook in danger, it wouldn't be in danger. Fortunately, my knight is there to protect it.} Nf6 {And my knight is protected by the queen.} 14. Qf2 O-O {I castle king-side.} 15. O-O-O {He castles queen-side. This move made me curious, for he could of castled either way, but generally you would castle king-side. Are his defenses better queen-side? Is he worried about my pawns king-side. Well either way, his king is still well protected. } Qe8 {I already knew the pawns were about to fight.} 16. fxe4 fxe4 17. d3 exd3 18. Bxd3 Ne5 {I'm hoping to get my knight on d3. Not a good idea at this time.} 19. Be2 {Even less of a good idea now.} Qe6 20. Qe1 {My plan is to now converge on c4, hoping for 20. Nxc4 21. Bxc4 Qxc4. This will leave me with a pawn up.} Nxc4 21. Bxc4 Qxc4 {My plan went perfectly.} 22. Rd4 Qe6 23. Rf1 {Not sure what he's planning at the moment.} b6 24. g4 c5 {Hoping to drive back the rook some.} 25. Rd2 {And it worked.} Ne4 {Now I attack the d2 rook more, but I overlooked what was about to happen.} 26. Rxf8+ {I see now my opponent is one who is willing for a even trade between pieces.} Rxf8 {So am I.} 27. Rb2 {The rook and bishop weren't free anymore, so I turned my attention elsewhere. } h5 {Some even trade between the pawns.} 28. gxh5 gxh5 {I'm still a pawn up, but maybe not for long.} 29. Bd2 {Nope, he didn't see it.} Qxh3 {Now I'm two pawns up.} 30. Qg1+ {I could of moved my king, but my knight was gonna help me do something else.} Qg3 {We all knew what was next.} 31. Qxg3+ Nxg3 {I still have an advantage.} 32. bxc5 bxc5 33. Ba5 {Probably going for my d6 pawn.} h4 {Now he's in trouble! I plan to bring back the queen.} 34. Rb6 {I was expecting him to use his bishop, not his rook.} h3 {Instead of protecting it, I decide to worry him with my h pawn.} 35. Rb2 {I worried him.} Nf1 {I see opportunity to take the rook. } 36. e4 {Wasn't really paying attention to that piece.} h2 {What will he do?} 37. Rg2+ {Yet another move I didn't expect.} Kh8 38. Rxh2+ {Now his rook is gone.} Nxh2 39. Bc7 {Now he attacks my d6 pawn.} Rf6 {Of course I protect it. I still want my queen back.} 40. Kd2 Re6 {I knew his e4 pawn would stay...} 41. Kd3 Ng4 42. a4 Nf6 {...but it wouldn't stay for long.} 43. e5 dxe5 44. Bd8 e4+ {My pawn is protected by the rook. I go for the queen now.} 45. Kc4 Nd7 {And I still protect my pieces.  } 46. Bg5 {It won't be that easy for him.} Re5 47. Bd8 e3 {Getting closer.} 48. Kd3 e2 {Even closer.} 49. Kc4 {A bit surprised he didn't get his bishop involved.} e1=Q {Now my advantage is massive! What surprised me though, is that psilure78 continued to play instead of resign. There's really nothing to gain now. Checkmate is near.} 50. Bf6+ {He must of panicked. } Nxf6 {Now there's definitely nothing to gain, but the game continues.} 51. Kd3 Qg3+ {I start lining up for checkmate.} 52. Kc4 Qf4+ {The next moves are inevitable.} 53. Kb3 Re3+ 54. Kc2 Qf2+ 55. Kc1 {No resignation.} Re1# {The game is now over, and the first of two wonderful games was complete. I hope you enjoyed this annotation. I also annotated the other game, which was also pretty good.       }
