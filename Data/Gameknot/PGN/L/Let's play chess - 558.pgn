[Opening "Philidor (C41), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The Philidor defense.  I don't care for it much when I play Black.} 3. Bc4 Bg4 {Black breaks the book but his move, Bg4, does not seem very good to me.  I like playing with my Bishops against his Knights so if he wants to trade I will oblige him.  I will continue to develop my pieces in an attempt to gain space.} 4. Nc3 c6 {Not sure about this pawn structure.  Seems a bit weak to me but, again, I don't play Philidor as Black.} 5. d3 {I will continue to open up space and develop pieces.} b5 {Seems as if Black is not to concerned with his pawn structure.} 6. Bb3 Nf6 7. a3 d5 8. h3 {Now to force him to exchange his Bishop for my Knight or retreat.} Bxf3 {He does the exchange and I am happy.  I have two Bishops and a Knight to his two Knights and a Bishop.} 9. Qxf3 {He wants to trade so now I am gaining space.} d4 10. Ne2 {More odd pawn moves.  This opens the diagonal a2-g7 for my Bishop and my other Bishop is shooting down c1-h6. } Be7 11. Bd2 a5 12. Qg3 {Bit of a threat on g7 but Black can easily counter it. } O-O {Which he does but now my light Bishop is aimed at the King and my Queen aimed at g7.  His pawn structure on the Queen side is very strange to me.  Don't think that I have seen one like this before.   Now to mess with his King side pawn structure.} 13. Bh6 {A new threat of Qxg7#.  Again, keep Black on the defensive so that he can not develop an attack.} g6 {I would have moved Ne8.  g6 gives me a Rook for a Bishop.  } 14. Bxf8 Qxf8 {Seems that Black is blocking his pieces in.  The Queen can only move down the diagonal f8-h6 or along the 8th row.  I would have taken the Bishop with the King and then developed the Knight and moved the Bishop to h4 to attack the White Queen. } 15. f3 {Now to add a bit of strength to my pawn structure.  I think that I can castle to the Kings side and have a good defense, depending on what Black does next.  After this I can start hacking my way through his pawns on the Queen side unless Black does something brilliant. } a4 {Not brilliant.} 16. Ba2 {Keep the Bishop aimed at the King.} b4 {Again with the odd pawn move.  This gives me a pawn and weakens his defense yet again.  I would have moved the Bishop to d6.} 17. Qxe5 c5 {His pawns keep moving forward which gives me the opportunity to get behind them and cause problems. } 18. O-O {But first I need to protect my King a bit.} h6 {Again, Black seems to think that pawns need to play forward.} 19. Nf4 Bd6 {Blunder for Black. Pulls the Bishop off the defense of the knight and give me a piece.} 20. Qxf6 Nd7 21. Ne6 {I am ahead in material and space so will trade off Queens. If I retreat my Queen it just lets him chase her around that side of the board, lets him develop pieces on the Kings side of the board, and could in the long run get my Queen trapped.  I am sure that Black will take my Queen but another line is 21. ... f7xe6 22. Bxe6+ Kh7 (which could be a bit better for Black that what he did)} Nxf6 22. Nxf8 Rxf8 {Now I am only a pawn ahead and a Rook for a Bishop but my pawn structure is strong and his Bishop is dark while my pawns are, for the most part on the light squares.} 23. Bc4 Rb8 24. Rfb1 b3 25. cxb3 axb3 {Black has given me a passed pawn on the a file.  Now I just have to keep it.} 26. a4 Ra8 {Black has his pawns spread out, several on the dark squares which blocks his Bishop, and he has little to defend them with.  Now I can pick off the b pawn and move my pawns down field.} 27. Bxb3 {Cleared a second pawn from the Queen's side of the board.  Now to aim as much as I can down board toward the a and b file. } Nh5 28. Bd5 Ra5 29. b3 Nf4 30. Rb2 {Not sure but Rook to d1 might have been better.  In need to pull out the chess board and see where that move could lead.} Nxd3 31. Rd2 Nb4 32. Bc4 Bf4 33. Rdd1 Nc2 34. Ra2 Ne3 35. Rd3 Nxc4 {Only thing that Black could do.  Every-other move (except not moving the Knight) and the Knight is lost for nothing.} 36. bxc4 {There is now an open file on a and b and Black has nothing to defend them with.} Ra8 37. Rb3 {Trading off even in the end and I am still up a pawn and a Rook for a Bishop.  I also have a passed pawn with a Rook backup, a Rook on an open file, and a still strong pawn structure. Now is just a matter of time and not making any blunders on white's part.} Be3+ 38. Kf1 h5 {Continue to bring the King out and into play.  I am aiming the King at d3 to block the pawn and free the b Rook from its defensive position. Once the king gets to d3 the Rook is free to move about the board and cause problems for Black in the back field. } 39. Ke2 Bg5 {I don't see this as a good move.  I would have Bf4 for a better shot toward the Queen's side.} 40. Rb5 {The Rook is free to make threats and force Black back onto the defensive.  } Be7 {His dark Bishop is almost useless. All my pieces are on light and the only thing he can attack with is the Rook but the Rook is tied up blocking the a pawn which is moving down field.  } 41. Kd3 {Using the King to block his pawn and keep the board tied up.} Kf8 {Now he attempts to bring the King out.  To little, to late I think.} 42. a5 {Bishop is attempting to guard the c pawn and is stuck, Rook is attempting to guard the a file and is stuck.  White is fat, dumb and happy just looking to move the a pawn down the board.} Ke8 {It is now a foot race but the King is a bit far way and the b Rook can move to the attack.} 43. a6 Kd8 44. Rb7 {Use the Rook on the 7th row.  Old chess axiom.  Now to bring the other Rook and pawn into a position that will cause Black more grief.} f5 {Does Black want me to take the pawn?  } 45. e5 {Would have been dumb to take the pawn.  Just move on down the board and let the other pawns block Black's pawns.  The King is in the wrong place to help defend against ether passed pawn.} g5 46. e6 Ke8 47. a7 {Now I am position to trade off even and come out ahead no matter how Black wants to trade.} Bd6 48. Ra6 {Take over the 6th row and have almost free run of the board.} Bg3 49. Rab6 {I am aiming at b8 forcing an exchange and coming out with a piece and two passed pawns.  } g4 {Last desperate attempt to open the Kings side of the board but to no avail. } 50. Rb7b8+ {He could move the King but then Black loses his Rook.  He has to take the Rook.} Bxb8 51. Rxb8+ {Again, the same.  Black must take the Rook or he will lose the rook.  Black sees that it is over and resigns. If this line continues then 51. ... Rxb8 52. a7xb8+ (Queen) and then finish up with a pawn and Queen to do the King in.}
