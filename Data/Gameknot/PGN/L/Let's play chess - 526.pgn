[Opening "Sicilian (B23), Grand Prix attack, Schofman variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 {The opening is called "The Grand Prix Attack." The point of it is to launch a hard-hitting attack on the king side. Black expertly avoids this however.} g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 Nd4 6. O-O Nxb5 7. Nxb5 d5 {This move transfered out of opening book, ending my attack.  It was a great move by black, and transfered the game into a closed posistion.} 8. e5 a6 9. Nc3 Nh6 10. d4 c4 {Not taking the pawn was a wise choice, as it would allow White to get back into an open game with attacking chances.} 11. b3 O-O 12. bxc4 dxc4 13. Rb1 b5 14. a4 Qa5 {A great move! I didn't see this one coming and took a long time to analyze my way out of it.} 15. Qe1 Bf5 16. Nd5 Qd8 17. Ne3 Bd7 18. Qc3 Rb8 {18...bxa5 I think would be better, but 18...Rb8 was still a great move.} 19. axb5 {I do this to relieve some of the tension on the queenside. It may not have been the best move, but it helped me to not have to go into long analysis about how to keep that pawn alive.} axb5 20. d5 Nf5 21. Nd4 {Now, looking back, this may not have been the strongest move, as it just invites liquidation in a posistion where my oppenet has two pawn closing in on my turf.} Nxe3 22. Qxe3 b4 23. Bd2 {A blunder-like move on my part.} c3 24. Be1 Qc7 25. Bh4 Rfe8 26. Rfe1 Qc4 {A great move!} 27. Qe4 Ba4 28. Rba1 Bxc2 {The Bishop sacrifice seals the game as a draw.  White had the small edge until that point, now black has that tiny advantage. However, as you will see, that advantage isn't enough to win it.} 29. Nxc2 Qxe4 30. Rxe4 b3 31. Rc1 {I offer the material back.  If Black accepts it, White gets the edge back. If it is denied, Black maintains the small edge.} f6 32. exf6 b2 33. Rb1 Bxf6 34. Bg5 {I should just have gone with 34. Bxf6, as it may have led to a quicker draw.} Kf7 35. Kf2 Bg7 {A great move! By preserving the Bishop, Black ensures that White will not be able to take the lead from him!} 36. d6 {Here I was just trying for a draw. Other moves would have let Black keep both Rooks, making it easier to Queen a pawn.} exd6 37. Ke3 Rxe4+ 38. Kxe4 Rb5 39. g4 Ke6 40. Bh4 h6 41. Be1 h5 42. h3 Rd5 {A small mismove on Black's part. 42...hxg4 43. hxg4 Rc5 may have gotten Black the win he so desired.} 43. Ke3 Rc5 44. Kd3 {Here neither side can pull out a win, so we agreed to a draw.  It was an amazing game by both sides, and one of the toughest games I've played here on GameKnot. Great game henrycrun!}
