1. d4 d5 {Queen's pawn game} 2. e3 c5 {Here black prefered a variation of the Queen's gambit rather than Nf6} 3. c3 Nc6 4. Bb5 Bd7 5. Bxc6 Bxc6 6. dxc5 {The gambit was finally accepted} e5 {black are trying to control the center} 7. Nf3 e4 8. O-O {perhaps white didnt notice the pawn which is attacking the knight} Bxc5 {apparently a strange move, but it is aiming for positional advantage} 9. Nd4 Nf6 10. Nxc6 {King's knight for a bad bishop... excellent trade for black} bxc6 11. b4 Bd6 12. Bd2 O-O 13.
