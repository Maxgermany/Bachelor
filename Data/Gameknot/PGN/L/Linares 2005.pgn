1. e4 c5 {The opening is relatively common so I'll refrain from annotations till later.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3 Nf6 4. Be2 Bg4 5. d3 e6 6. Nbd2 Nc6 7. Nf1 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. Qa4 Bh5 10. Ng3 Nb6 11. Qd1 Bg6 12. O-O Be7 13. a4 O-O 14. a5 Nd5 15. Qa4 Qc7 16. d4 cxd4 17. Nxd4 Nxd4 18. Qxd4 {Unfamiliar to some, but Anand navigates the position well. White has a queenside majority of pawns, and his central queen dominates the board. However Black threatens with 18...Bf6 or 18...Rd8, even 18...Nb4 is strong.} f5 {(!) Anand prepares for 19...e5 with a dominant centre. At the price of limiting his own g6-bishop, Black limits the g3-knight. Anand saw this as more important.} 19. Qa4 Rad8 20. Rd1 {The potential for counterplay is visible after Anand's 20...e5 21.Bc4...} f4 {(!) Although relinquishing control of e4, note how badly placed the c1-bishop is!} 21. Ne4 Qe5 22. Bf3 b5 {(!) If 23.Qxb5? Then 23...Bxe4. If 23.axb6? Then 23...Nxb6 24.Qc2 Bxe4 25.Bxe4 Qxe4!} 23. Qc2 Nf6 {(!)} 24. Nxf6+ Qxf6 25. Qb3 Rxd1+ 26. Qxd1 Rd8 27. Qe2 Bd3 {White has been forced back into his back three ranks!} 28. Qe1 e5 {White has no source of queenside counterplay, the Black pawns control the centre.} 29. Be2 Bxe2 30. Qxe2 e4 {(!) 31.Qxe4?? Rd1+ 0-1} 31. g3 e3 {(!) Checkmate is near!} 32. fxe3 f3 {(!)} 33. Qxb5 f2+ 34. Kg2 Rf8 {0-1 A lesson by Anand on how to kill off counterplay.... Before it begins!}
