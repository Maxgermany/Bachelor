1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 {I was trying a new opening out against a lower ranked player. A move to e5 would end up with my queen at d1  in a few moves , not allowing a castle. I do not like playing the usual double kings pawn or queen pawn opening. Boring. I like the more unconventional opening. JEREMY} 3. Nc3 g6 4. Bd3 Bg7 {I was looking to get the Fianchetto bishop set. Control the center  without owning it.} 5. Nge2 O-O 6. O-O a6 {Castling was the main goal early, the opponent did right after me. White wasn't pushing hard , especially since it has the advantage with center squares. 6.....a6 wasn't the best move, any comments on a better one?? } 7. d5 c5 8. Nf4 e5 {Some pawn movements... The last move was a little pressure on the horse. } 9. Nfe2 b5 10. b3 b4 {I'm choosing the battle to be at the queen side this game. I will eventually flank all my horses to the queen side.} 11. Na4 Bd7 12. a3 a5 {The exchanges 12....a4 would not be good. Had to back up the b4 pawn and bring in help.} 13. c4 bxa3 14. Bxa3 Bxa4 15. bxa4 {After the exchange, the 2 horse attack starts, and my opp. makes some not good moves.} Na6 16. Nc3 Nb4 17. Be2 Nd7 18. Rc1 Nb6 {Now I have the horses in position for the attack } 19. g3 Bh6 20. f4 f6 {I didn't want to exchange the pawns on f4. I didn't like the outcome.} 21. Qd2 Qd7 22. Kg2 {Not a good move... 22Bd1 would be better...} Nxa4 23. Bd1 Nxc3 24. Qxc3 Na2 {The bishop move came a day late, dollar short. Now the fork is set....} 25. Qc2 Nxc1 26. Qxc1 a4 27. h3 exf4 28. gxf4 Bg7 {Minor pawn movement, not a strong part of the game.I would like comments on better moves here.... Since I am up 3 points, I can wait to get the attacking angles right.} 29. Bg4 f5 30. exf5 gxf5 31. Bh5 {That exchange ended not good for the opp. - was forced to move the bishop to h5, gave me tempo.} Bd4 {Strongest spot in board for my only bishop.} 32. Qe1 Qg7+ 33. Kh2 Qh6 {Pressure on h5} 34. Rg1+ Bxg1+ {Opp. must of forgot of the bishop....???? 34Rg1 ????} 35. Qxg1+ Qg7 {I want the exchange...} 36. Qe3 Rab8 37. Qe6+ {Not falling for 37.Qf7 " Take my pawns... I don't give a damn".} Kh8 38. Qxd6 Rb3 {Checkmate time..... Now the rooks come into play////} 39. Qxc5 Qg3+ 40. Kh1 Rb1+ {Two forced kills, then checkmate.... Till next time... JEREMY} 41. Bc1 Rxc1+ 42. Bd1 Rxd1+ 43. Qg1 Qxg1# {}
