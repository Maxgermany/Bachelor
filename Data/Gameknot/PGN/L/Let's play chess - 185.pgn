1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 {Damiano's Defense. } 3. d4 {NxPe5 is surprisingly popular for white, but the outcomes appear generally bleak for black.} exd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Qg4 d6 6. Ne6 {Black can attack with Qe7.  White could respond with Bc4, but this isn't enough--black parries with Pb5 and white retreats to Bb3...  I guess that works out well for white.} Bxe6 {Or black can simply trade bishop for knight.} 7. Qxe6+ Qe7 8. Qc4 b5 9. Qb4 c6 {Black might have preferred not to move that pawn, but the knight there instead.  This would develop a better piece, and release the rook while pushing the white queen.} 10. Nc3 g6 11. g3 Bh6 12. f4 f5 13. Be2 Nf6 14. O-O fxe4 15. Rd1 O-O {Black leaves Pd6 to the white's rook wolf.} 16. f5 {This pawn sacrifice seems ill advised.  Oh, never mind--BxBh6.  Black might trade bishops instead, and net a free pawn.} Bxc1 17. Raxc1 Rd8 18. Qb3+ Kg7 19. Rdf1 gxf5 20. Rxf5 Re8 21. Rg5+ Kf8 22. Rf1 {Black should be aware of the threat of Rg8#.  Nf6 no longer defends g8.  Black is advised to play Qe6, or perhaps even better--Pd5.} Nbd7 {That wasn't it.} 23. Rg8# {}
