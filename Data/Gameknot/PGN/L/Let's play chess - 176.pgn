1. e4 {White - Alan 76 from UK} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. h3 Na5 {8.h3 Na5 not common.  I'm chasing his good B.} 9. c3 Nxb3 10. Qxb3 {I would have re-captured with the pawn to open my a-file.} Be6 11. Qc2 c5 12. d3 h6 13. Be3 O-O 14. d4 {Seems like 12.d3 was wasted.} cxd4 15. cxd4 Qb8 16. dxe5 {?  This allows me to equalize.} dxe5 17. Bd2 Nh7 {17...b4 quicker except a pawn exchange on b4 could lead to a rook exchange which could displace my Q from protecting e5} 18. Nc3 f6 {18... I thought this plan involved too much shuffling, but it panned out for me.} 19. a3 Rc8 20. Qd3 Bc4 21. Qd7 {21.Qd7 not sure he can capture my DSS on e7 due to ...Ra7, e.g. 21...Nf8 22.Qxe7 (check out 22.Qf5) Ra7 23.Qb4 or 23.Nd5 Bxd5 24.Qb4.  Also watch for his B or N sac on h6.} Nf8 22. Qxe7 Ra7 {}
