1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bf4 Nc6 5. Ne5 Bd7 6. Nxd7 Qxd7 {Trading knights/bishops. Been pretty average up to this point. } 7. h4 Bb4 8. a3 Ba5 9. e4 {White loses a pawn. I capture the pawn with mine on d. Even if white recaptures using the knight, my knight can revenge kill. } dxe4 10. b4 Bb6 11. Bc4 Nxd4 {Helping myself to an extra pawn} 12. O-O O-O-O 13. b5 Qe7 14. a4 e5 15. Bg5 Ba5 16. Nd5 Qd6 17. f4 h6 18. Bxf6 gxf6 {Trading pieces} 19. Qh5 Nxc2 {Helping myself to another pawn } 20. Rad1 Bb6+ {Trying to lure the knight away so my knight can trap the rooks} 21. Kh1 Qc5 22. Kh2 Qxc4 {White leaves the bishop open} 23. Rf2 Bxf2 {For some reason, White moves the knight directly into the path of my bishop? Maybe he forgot my bishop was there. } 24. Nxf6 Rxd1 {Taking the unprotected rook } 25. Kh3 Qd3+ {Moving in for the kill } 26. Kg4 Qg3+ {And the next move sees a checkmate. King moves to f5, queen captures the f pawn. I think white's mistake in this game was letting me just have free reign of the board; I took all the pieces and surreptitiously trapped the king. However, it's more of a case of White just making careless mistakes rather than being able to imagine all the possibilities of a move. }
