1. d4 c6 2. c4 d5 {I went into this game wanting to play the Caro Kann.  I had been reading about the fact that you keep a fairly solid pawn structure throughout which gives you an advantage in the endgame.  I tried to focus on keeping solid kingside structure in the midgame.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 Bf5 5. h3 h6 6. g4 Bh7 7. cxd5 cxd5 8. Bg2 e6 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. O-O Bd6 11. a3 Qc7 12. Nb5 Qd7 13. Nxd6+ Qxd6 14. Qb3 b6 15. Bd2 O-O 16. Rac1 Ne7 17. Bb4 Qd8 18. Ne5 Re8 19. Rc3 Ng6 20. Nc6 Qd7 21. Rfc1 Nh4 22. Ne5 Qb5 {Qb5 was a HUGE blunder.  I was going for something more aggressive, but in hindsight, (and what should have been foresight) Qd8 was the only good move.} 23. Bf1 Nf3+ {The plan here was, 24. Nxf3 Qd7} 24. Kh1 {Kh1 is definitely a blunder.} Be4 25. Bxb5 Nxd4+ 26. Kg1 Nxb3 27. Rxb3 {And I lose my knight for a pawn, as good a save as I could have hoped for.} Rec8 {Maybe trading off is a bad idea, but I can't exploit my good pawn structure in the end game without GETTING to the endgame.} 28. Rxc8+ Rxc8 29. Rc3 Rxc3 30. Bxc3 Nh7 31. Bd3 Bxd3 32. Nxd3 Ng5 33. Kg2 {Nf3 thwarted} Ne4 34. f3 Nd6 {Eyeing the c4 square} 35. Nb4 Nc4 36. Bd4 {Thwarted again} e5 37. Bc3 Nxe3+ 38. Kf2 d4 39. Bd2 Nd1+ 40. Ke2 Nxb2 {Needless to say, I was fairly happy with the last 4 moves} 41. Nd5 f6 42. Nb4 {He wasted tempo with that, what was he trying to do?} Kf7 43. Nc6 {That's a little more direct} a5 44. Bc1 Na4 45. Kd3 Nc5+ 46. Kc4 Ke6 47. Nxa5 {Good move, I should have seen it coming, but I was totally not looking for it.  I HAVE to hold on to my knight.  Can't trade it off yet.} Kd6 48. Nb3 Na4 {I didn't even realize what I had done until after I did it.  Splitting my knight and my pawn away from my king where they aren't protected is bad, mmmkay.} 49. Kb4 {He didn't see Kb5.  49. Kb5 Kc7 50. Kxa4, so I have to play 49. ... Nc3 and he would have won my pawn for free.  } Nc3 50. Bd2 Ne2 {Eyeing the g1 square} 51. Kb5 Kc7 52. h4 {good move} Ng1 53. f4 Nf3 54. fxe5 fxe5 55. g5 {I'm down 1 point, with 3 passed pawns, lets go for it.} Nxd2 56. Nxd2 hxg5 57. hxg5 Kd6 {Ditch the hanging pawn and push right up the middle.} 58. Kxb6 Kd5 59. a4 e4 60. a5 e3 61. Nf3 d3 62. a6 d2 63. a7 d1=Q 64. a8=Q+ {Bad luck I happen to be right where I don't want to be.} Ke6 65. Qe8+ Kf5 66. Qe5+ Kg6 67. Qe4+ Kh5 68. Qh4+ Kg6 69. Qe4+ {I can keep this up forever.} Kh5 70. Qh4+ {Game ended in a draw.}
