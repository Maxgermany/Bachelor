1. e4 {Hi all. This game isn't very "good" in a sense that I managed to win a pawn in the first few moves of the game. However, it may be helpful in identifying what not to do, and it shows how to hold an extra pawn without generating other weaknesses among one's camp. It also shows a little tactical shot available to white when the king is centered, even in the endgame when queens are exchanged. I also need practice annotating. Any comments and suggestions would be great.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {The French Defense. A very solid system for black. Black usually concedes space early in the game, and also voluntarily blocks the c8 bishop. In many games this bishop becomes a problem to develop, but black's plan is usually to initiate a queenside attack, or to trade off into an endgame, when black's pawn structure would grant him an advantage. White opts to keep black cramped and avoid simplification (unless it favors him, of course).} c5 {? This move is statistically bad for black. As long as white doesn't make mistakes, it is a won game. Black chooses to undermine the center without realizing that he will lose material. It may possibly be used as a gambit, but it is one that doesn't offer black any sort of compensation. It could have been just a mistake on the player's part, but given that he must have played this system and has won some games, that may unlikely be the case.} 4. exd5 exd5 5. dxc5 Bxc5 {? another mistake which practically costs black the game. Not only does he lose a pawn, but he loses the queen as well, guaranteeing white a won game. Black has no queen to generate threats as compensation for the pawn. Better was 5..Nf6, protecting the d pawn. There was no rush to take the pawn. } 6. Qxd5 Bb4 7. Qxd8+ {Because of this, black's king remains centered, and the exchange of queens favors White greatly.} Kxd8 8. Bd2 Bc5 9. O-O-O {White will now seek to simplify. an extra pawn is sometimes not enough for a win, but black's king is still centered, allowing white to develop with tempo.} Bd7 {Developing both bishops before both knights is usually bad, and it is a general rule to develop both knights before both bishops. Though Black was in a desperate situation, he had better options. The threat was 10. Be3 , winning a piece.} 10. f3 Ne7 11. Bd3 Nbc6 12. Nge2 Rc8 13. Bb5 {And here, I plan on ceding my two bishops and allowing black the two bishops. In an open game such as this, the extra pawn usually doesn't give an advantage, as the two bishops would equalize the position. However, I was confident that I could force further trades, and the black king is still centered. This, as we will see, becomes a problem for him.} Rg8 {? A strange move on Black's part. It is a waste of time in this case. } 14. Bxc6 Nxc6 15. Ne4 Be7 16. a3 {At this point I was just focusing on solidifying my position.} f5 {The centralized knight was becoming troublesome for Black, but this potentially allows me to fix the pawns on the queenside, or if an eventual ..g5, f4 ..gf, Nxf4 gives white  an outpost, as we will see soon.} 17. Ne4c3 Ke8 {Black wanted to move his king from the potential threat of the rook. Now he can develop his light-squared bishop without the threat of a discovered check.} 18. Be3 g5 19. f4 b6 20. fxg5 {Now Black must cede the two bishops and further simplify into an endgame, stripping him of any sort of counterplay. The knight is given his outpost, and Black's pawn is fixd on a light square.} Bxg5 21. Bxg5 Rxg5 22. Rhe1 {! Black cannot take on g2. 23.Nf4 !! wins the rook.} Rc7 {? And here is where I believe he lost the game. It was a waste of time and gave White opportunities for tactical play, with the potential threat of Nd5 and discovered check with the rook on e1.} 23. Nf4+ Kf7 {At this point Black was lost. Any other move loses material. If 23..Kf8, 24.Rxd7! Rxd7 25.Ne6  and White is ahead a piece. If 23..Kd8, 24.Ne6 ! And if 23..Ne7, 24.N(c3)d5 wins material as well.} 24. Nb5 {And Black loses his rook with a simple knight fork.}
