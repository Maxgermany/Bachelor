1. e4 {King's pawn} e5 {old school} 2. Nf3 {Ok, so what will it be, Roy Lopez, Petroff, Italian Game, etc ...?} Nf6 {Petroff it is} 3. Nxe5 {Standard stuff} Nxe4 {Nxe? Now we're a little out of sorts with the Damiano. } 4. Qe2 {White slugs along with accurate play.} Nf6 {Nf6?? Qe7 probably considered best move. This however was a serious blunder. What was I thinking? Obviously, whatever it was, it wasn't well thought out! This game is for practical purposes over, but I'll plug along and see what comes of it.} 5. Nc6+ Be7 6. Nxd8 Kxd8 {}
