1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Standard Ruy Lopez opening.} a6 {Threatens to capture the bishop.} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {I felt this was better than 4 ... bxc6; this allows my LSB development, but a fianchetto is already blocked by my own c-pawn.} 5. Nxe5 Bc5 6. d4 Bxd4 7. Nf3 Qd6 8. Nbd2 {Did obee consider 8 Nxd4?} Bg4 9. c3 O-O-O 10. cxd4 Qb4 11. a3 {In turn trying to capture my queen.} Qd6 12. O-O c5 13. dxc5 Qxc5 14. Qb3 Nf6 15. Qxf7 Rhf8 {I in turn threaten obee's queen; at worst he exchanges his queen for my rook.} 16. Qxg7 Rd7 {This time, the f6 knight defends.} 17. Qxf6 {? I do not see the point of this move. Better was Qh6 or Qg6.} Rxf6 {Free queen!} 18. Re1 Rd3 {Attacking both knights.} 19. h3 Rfxf3 {A piece sacrifice that prepares checkmate.} 20. gxf3 Bxf3 {The Queen plans to move to g5 next turn.} 21. b4 {This is the move that cost white the game. Nxf3 maybe?} Qg5+ {White has only two options here, namely 22 Kf1, or 22 Kh2, both of which lead to 22 ... Qg2#} 22. Kf1 Qg2# {Mate. Can obee analyze this game?}
