1. d4 f5 {Black chooses the "tight-agressive" Dutch Opening, an opening  not very familiar to black. } 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. h4 d5 5. e3 c6 6. Be2 Be6 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. Ng5 {Naturally... Black should have prevented this by playing H5 - H6.  } Bf7 9. h5 {White doesn't waste a second...} Bg7 {Last call for that exchange...} 10. Nxf7 {Naturally...} Kxf7 {...Placing the king in a very uncomfortable position in the center...} 11. hxg6+ hxg6 12. Rxh8 Qxh8 13. Bd2 Qh1+ {I don't know what black was thinking here... I think that even black doesn't have a clue... testing i guess...} 14. Bf1 Rh8 15. Qe2 e5 16. O-O-O Qh7 {Change of plans... the queen and rook are shooting the wrong way... } 17. cxd5 cxd5 18. dxe5 Nxe5 19. Nb5 Ne4 {!! The decisive move!! Hoping white takes the bait...} 20. Nxa7 {He does?????????????? White totally gives up his initiative, and from this moment on white is on "reactive mode" - black has gained all the initiative....} Ra8 21. Nb5 Rxa2 22. f3 Ng3 23. Qf2 Nxf1 24. Qxf1 Nc4 {The threat is revealed ! Now the lonely b2 pawn is in great danger...} 25. Bc3 Bxc3 26. bxc3 Qh8 {Bull's Eye! (and not g7).} 27. Qd3 {Now white has regained his initiative and is threatening to win a pawn, possibly a knight, and even later pass a pawn.... That white rook has to go!!!} Ra1+ 28. Kc2 Rxd1 29. Nd6+ {A terrible mistake???....... the rest is pretty straightforward...} Nxd6 30. Qxd1 Qe5 31. Qd3 Nc4 32. e4 Nb6 33. exd5 Qxd5 34. Qe3 Nc4 35. Qh6 b5 36. Qh7+ Kf6 37. f4 Qxg2+ 38. Kb3 Qb2# {Not such a bad ending for a game i wanted to resign in a couple of instances :) But let's face it, white played bad moves in key situations, and ultimately lost...}
