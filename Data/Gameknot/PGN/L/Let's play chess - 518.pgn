1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 c6 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 Bd7 {A funny move. Bg4, dxc4 and e6 are the normal moves in this position. I don't really understand what the bishop is supposed to be doing on d7.} 5. O-O dxc4 {Not a good idea at all. the dxc4 lines are the only heavily theoretical lines in the Reti Slav and Bd7 is not a good move, it belongs on e6 in most lines or if not the queen needs access to d5 so white definately has an edge now in a position which can at the best of times need accurate play from Black} 6. a4 {Qc2 is more normal in these lines (e.g. Nf3, d5, c4, c6, g3, Nf6, Bg2, dxc4, 0-0, Nbd7, Qc2 would be mainline) but I felt that now the usual plans of defending the pawn with Be6 and Nd7b6 wont fly then I can afford to secure the position on the queenside, play Na3, Qc2, win the pawn and have the better game.} Qc7 7. Na3 b5 {This is a terrible move. Weakening the h1-a8 diagonal and not even holding the pawn. Things are even worse after a deep think though. The lines get a bit sharp but are worth looking at. The continuation will be axb5, cxb5, Nd4 after which Black can branch:  1. ... Bc6?!, Naxb5, Qd7 (Qb6??, Ra6!) Nxc6, Nxc6, Nd4 with a lost position 2. ... Nc6, Naxb5, Qb7, Nxc6, Bxc6, Rxa7!, Rxa7,  (Bxg2, Rxb7, Bxb7 shouldn't give enough compensation for the queen) Nxa7, Qxa7, Bxc6+ } 8. axb5 cxb5 9. Nd4 Nc6 10. Naxb5 Qb6 {A losing move, as mentioned before, Qb7 was the way to go though it's still not great} 11. Ra6 {There is no defence. Qxa6 obviously runs into Nc7+ Whilst all other queen moves drops the knight.} Nxd4 12. Rxb6 Nxb5 13. Rxb5 {The last tactic to completely finish the game. Bxa8??, axb6 would have given some slight compensation though insufficient but the played move forces resignation.}
