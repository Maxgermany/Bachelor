1. e4 {Hi to all. First, I say "My English is very poor". Sorry if I committed mistakes in the annotation of the game. This is my first annotated game, a very dynamical play in a very sharp variation of the Two Knights defense. I used the StockFish for the postmortem analysis, but I tried to gives  my own calculations in the game and, if I or my opponent did't see a critical variation, estimates with the chess engine. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {I prefer this variation to the alternative 3... Bc5. But, matter of taste!} 4. Ng5 {If I played this position with white, I had moved 4 d4. But, againg, matter of taste, both variation are theoretical.} Bc5 {Two Knights defense, Traxler variation. I played, few years ago, this maneuver. Actually, I am playing the Fritz variation ( 4... d5 5 exd5 Nd4) without bad results. With the 4 ... d5 variation too is possible 5 ... Na5 (normal variation, I think) and 5 ... b5.   Now, white has three principal moves: 5 Bxf7+ (In my juice, the strongest move) 5 d4 and the move of the game, fork queen and rook.} 5. Nxf7 Bxf2+ {Black needs take risks, now.. This move is theoretical. I tried to remember variations of this line} 6. Kxf2 {The main alternative is 6. Kf1, keeping the fork in d8-h8 without gives a strong initiative to the black} Nxe4+ {I didn't remember the main variation, but I think about this natural move with check keep the attack} 7. Ke3 {It's too risky!! May be 7 Kg1 was sure and black had to move the queen (Qe7... if 7 Kg1 Qf6 8 Qf3 and black (minimum)  wasted a tempo)} Qh4 {Qe7 was an alternative not attractive. } 8. g3 {A nice try. I was calculated  about if 8 Nxh8 Qf2+ 9 Kxe4 d5+! 10 Kd3 Bf5+(StockFish gives me a better mate, but i did't see 10... dxc4+ 11 Kxc4 Qd4 and Qb4#) 11 Kc3 Qd4+ 12 Kb3 Qxc4+  13 Qa3 Qb4#, a funny king hunting . Alternatives to the 10th move was 10 Kxd5  Qd4#. 10 Bxd5 Bf5#.  } Nxg3 {Open the 4th file! without wasted of time} 9. hxg3 Qd4+ {This move is strong, better than Qxc4. However, I don't see something in the continuation of the game} 10. Kf3 d5 {Development first!} 11. Nxh8 {This move lost the game, in my opinion. White had Rh4 (I analyzed the postmortem with StockFish and white keep advantage in material). I don't see Rh4 in the game, only analyzes 11 Be2 and I was planned castle in the position. The variation in my mind was 11 Be2 0-0 (the knight is pinned) 12 Kg2 Rxf7 and white's king isn't in a sure place.  The variation gives for SF is 11 Rh4 e4+ 12 Kg2 0-0 13 Bb3 Rxf7  (0.73 for white). The attack vanishes on the lines of the engine!!!} Bg4+ {Capturing the queen and balances the material. Now, the position of the white king (and the development of the black pieces) gives a big advantage.} 12. Kg2 Bxd1 13. d3 {This move looks ugly, but black had the threat Bf3+ and Qe4+ winning the exchange} dxc4 14. Rxd1 O-O-O {I can castle because the knight is trapped!} 15. Nf7 Rf8 {The rook enters in the kingside quickly!} 16. Ng5 Rf2+ 17. Kh3 {If 17 Kh1 Qd5+ and mates in two moves. Equal for Kg1.  } Qd7+ {Not the best move, h5 with mate net (SF gives the move). Now, the best try is 18 g4 (not possible with 17... h5) but I had many variations with advantage (18 ... h5 19 Rg1 hxg4+ 20 Rxg4  Rg2 or 18... Rg2 19 Kxg2 Qxg4+ and Qxd1) but I didn't see a mate attack. } 18. Kh4 {Now, the mate is inevitable.} Rh2+ 19. Nh3 Rxh3+ 20. Kg5 Rxg3+ 21. Kh5 Qh3# {A wild game. Thanks for the future comments!}
