[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor. Seems to me that it must lose to White by force. It does force White to think, however, since it isn't oft played. Or in the least, it isn't oft played against good ol Tipsy. Hopefully, I can show you why! :) } 3. d4 Nc6 4. Bb5 {Virtually transposes to a Ruy Lopez. } Bd7 5. Bxc6 {I don't usually pull the trigger on the knight capture in the Ruy Lopez unless necessary, but with the extra d pawn in play thanks to this being a Philidor-Ruy Lopez hybrid (Philopez? Ruyidor? :P ) I figured I'd go for it. Plus I was kinda drunk. :) } Bxc6 6. d5 {There's that d pawn coming into play which wouldn't happen in the R-L proper. } Bd7 7. Bg5 f6 {Uncharted waters with that move, not on the database. I note Black's dcb is currently tipsy (I term the "bad" bishop as tipsy and the "good" bishop as sober to avoid the prejudicial terms bad and good), nor do I wish to park my dcb on the eventual g3 square. I have possible plans for kingside development, particularly should I decide to castle long. Therefore I avoid the R-Llike (but on the kingside) 8. Bh4 g5 9.Bg3. } 8. Be3 {Instead the bishop is recalled to a central square. Perhaps Black may forget about it's drunken bishop and find itself hampered in the middle? Perhaps not, but the bishop is now better at e3 than g5. } Ne7 {Not quite sure where Black is going with that, they appear to be cramping their own position. Perhaps setting up for Ng6, White could really put dampeners on that plan with 9h4. I did say I was contemplating kingside development and could get off to a flyer with the double pawn movement. Still, sometimes a poor move by an opponent can draw out a poor move on one's own behalf. Looking at this board, with all that Qside space, c4 and the beginnings of a Qside roll seems a much better double pawn movement than h4. Indeed, if coupled with h3, suddenly Black's sober bishop finds it has no place to go. } 9. c4 {If 9..c6 then White has the option of accepting the exchange or allowing the exchange to take place on d5 instead. } Ng6 10. b3 {Completes the pawn chain, sets up for that Qside roll I was talking about earlier, if 10..c6 can elect to exchange on d5 with exd5 and repair the pawn chain. } f5 {Black has designs of it own on building pawn chains, after 11. Nc3 f4 12 Bd2. Instead of being forced to retreat that bishop, it is tempting to go on the offensive and take both bishops off the board. } 11. Nc3 {White decides to prefer further development than the flashy Bg5. Besides, Black may miss 11...f4 and elect to exchange pawns. If not, then it will simply be a case of who uses their pawn chains to greater effect, and ol Tips is not shy of a tactical pawn-off! :) } f4 12. Bd2 Bg4 {No worries here, the exchange is favourable for White as it develops the Queen. } 13. O-O Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Nh4 {Predictable. And now there's the potential for trouble for Black....} 15. Qg4 g6 {That, to me, looks like a bonafide mistake leading to loss of knight. By blocking off the escape square, as soon as a pawn is posted on g3, that Black knight has nowhere to go. All that remains is to evaluate whether 16. g3 or 16. Qe6+ followed, eventually, by g3, is the better move. } 16. g3 {Ahh the value of always analysing before moving; as a rudimentary moving of the pieces revealed that 16.g3! was great, but 16. Qe6+??? was TERRIBLE! 16.Qe6+?? Be7 17.g3??	Nf3+! and White has gone from ahead to firmly behind! With that issue resolved, White posts its pawn on g3 and seals the knight's fate. Black will gain compensation in terms of 1 pawn and White's fortress being opened up. But the positional gain would have to be +2 for Black to break even and I don't rate it as that. Indeed the opening of the kingside will probably actually favour White in the end, with perhaps that f rook set to become devastating, perhaps even doubling up on the f file, whilst White's pawn chain prevents Black from any counterplay on the qside. Overall, it continues to amaze me how asking questions of an opponent, and increasing the pressure, can have such pronounced consequences in correspondence chess! When you've 7 days/move, surely all pressure is an illusion, all questions asked can be answered competently? Yet time and time again, after solid development, as soon as I build a little threat or two, an opponent buckles. I think I need more games against higher opponents.   } fxg3 17. fxg3 h5 {Second to my amazement that opponents would crack under pressure in a correspondence game, is that, once they are set to lose a piece, they go about maximising their loss! From a +2 situation, Black has gone to at least a full officer down in material, if I reply with the straightforward 18.Qxh4. That is my minimum gain. Now all that remains is rudimentary tactical analysis to see if the maxima and minima are the same, or if there isn't an even better line for White. 18. Qe6+ reappears as a reasonable option, one, perhaps, of many. } 18. Qe6+ {Watch this!} Qe7 19. Nb5 Qxe6 {Roll up, roll up, one and all! See the Amazing Tipsy single-handedly ruin castling, dethrone a Queen and capture a pawn, all in one move with his amazing, death-defying 3-way fork with the knight! } 20. Nxc7+ {Abracadbra! } Ke7 {Oh dear. Of all the places to move the king.....that was the worst! } 21. dxe6 {Black is about to haemorrhage material like a lungshot textile factory. } Kd8 {First, White will capture the rook. Then, with Rf7 the most likely move, it will secure the knight's retreat (unlike many a rook capture with the knight, this is not a suicide mission). That will also pin the king on the back rank. After all that, if I'm so inclined, I'll probably then take Black's knight. Or maybe I'll just mate, it will depend on Black's movements of course. } 22. Nxa8 {Faced with an untenable position, Black resigns. Told you the Philidor loses by force! :P }
