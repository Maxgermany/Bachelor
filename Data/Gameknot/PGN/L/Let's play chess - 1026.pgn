1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 3. Nc3 c6 4. Bc4 b5 5. Bb3 {It's clear at this point Black is trying to do all of his work with the pawns. I can't figure out why none of his pieces are still on the bench.} a5 {Black has just about taken away all the safe spaces for my bishop to go.} 6. a4 b4 7. Ne2 {Only safe place for the knight to go.} h5 8. d4 exd4 9. Nexd4 {Now I have a half-open file to his king.} c5 10. Nf5 Ne7 {It is here where Black kills himself. He cuts off a potential escape square for his own king, and most devastatingly, cuts off the bishop's protection of d6.} 11. Nd6# {Smothered mate. I hope this guy learns how important it is to get his minor pieces into the game quickly.}
