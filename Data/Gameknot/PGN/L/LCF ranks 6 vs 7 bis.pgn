1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {A Scotch game.} Bc5 5. Nxc6 Qf6 {Avoids doubled pawns but somewhat exposes the queen.} 6. Qd2 Qxc6 7. Bd3 Nf6 8. O-O O-O {8. ... Nxe4?? 9.  Re1} 9. b4 Bd4 10. c3 Bb6 11. c4 Bd4 {Makes use of the trapped rook and avoids a trapped bishop (a5 or either a6 save the bishop but it would be useless for quite some time).} 12. Bb2 Qd6 13. Bxd4 Qxd4 14. Qc3 Qxc3 {!? Not sure that exchanging the queens is the best option but there we go...} 15. Nxc3 b6 {There I was thinking about a Fianchetto but White would not cooperate.} 16. e5 Ne8 17. Be4 Rb8 18. f4 d6 19. exd6 {According to ChessMaster, 19. Rad1 is better. The text move indeed permits Black to become less cramped and under less pressure.} Nxd6 20. c5 {?! This pawn move is maybe the loosing one for Black for he exchanges his remaining bishop for a Knight. In hindsight, it proves costly in the double sided endgame that follows.} Nxe4 21. Nxe4 Bf5 22. Ng3 Bd3 23. Rfd1 Rfd8 24. cxb6 cxb6 25. a4 a5 26. b5 {Fix White pawns on squares that can be attacked by Black bishop. On the other hand, Black pawns cannot be defended by the same bishop... } Rbc8 27. Rac1 Rxc1 28. Rxc1 Rb8 {There, I became afraid of Rc6. I guess that this move is not rational at this point and Black is reacting to invisible treat. Black should play more dynamically but what?} 29. Nf1 f5 30. Ne3 Be4 {I thought I was being smart by preventing an approach road for the knight. I however forgot about Nc4...} 31. Rd1 Kf7 {Black is still seeing nothing.} 32. g3 {Rd6 was better there.} g6 {Ke6 was better there.} 33. Rd6 {A first piece attack the pawn.} Ke7 {There I again thought being smart by forcing the Rook to retreat.} 34. Nc4 {Et hop... White has a double attack on the pawn and protect the rook at the same time. At this point I stopped and pushed (virtual) wood around. And then I saw it!} Bc2 {! I will put an exclamation mark because I'm quite proud of this move. Now, I wasn't thinking very deep but just at something like: "he takes one of my pawns, I will take one of his. And if he doesn't Bb3 will come in handy." It will prove to be more than that actually...} 35. Rxb6 Rxb6 36. Nxb6 {The only way to get at a4 is to approach the king...} Bb3 {! but there is better at hand: horse trapped!} 37. Kf2 Kd8 38. Ke3 {The post-analysis with ChessMaster just discovered that playing 38. Na8 would have saved the Knight (at the price of two pawns): 38. Na8 Kc8 39. b6! Bxa4 40. Nc7... ChessMaster deems 38. Ke3 to be the main factor behind White demise.} Kc7 39. Na8+ Kb7 40. Kd4 Kxa8 41. Kc5 Bxa4 {ChessMaster considers this as a mistake and proposes b7 as the better alternative. Indeed, it saves Black a-pawn and only delays Bxa4...} 42. Kb6 Bd1 43. Kxa5 Kb7 44. Kb4 Kb6 45. Kc4 h6 46. Kd5 {There, I had to think deeply about how to win. At first, the win seems pretty easy: I'm up  one bishop for a pawn. Yet...} g5 {! I didn't find any other move that wins for sure. In other lines, Black may even ends up on the loosing side!} 47. Ke5 Bc2 48. Kf6 gxf4 49. gxf4 Kxb5 {The key point: bring back the king to protect the f-pawn and free the bishop from this task so that it can be sacrificed.} 50. Kg6 Kc5 51. Kxh6 Kd5 52. Kg5 Ke4 53. h4 Bd1 {And now White loses the f-pawn whatever he does and, in the same stride, ends up in a loosing pawn endgame.} 54. h5 Bxh5 55. Kxh5 Kxf4 56. Kh4 Ke3 57. Kg3 f4+ 58. Kg2 Ke2 {This is the first game I won against jongraft (and hopefully not the last)...}
