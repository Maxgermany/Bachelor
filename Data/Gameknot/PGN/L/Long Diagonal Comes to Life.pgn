1. e4 d6 2. d4 {In this short game, White gets into early trouble on the long diagonal.} Nf6 3. Bd3 e5 4. d5 {Relaxes central tension, in many lines, White tries to maintain central ltension.} c6 5. c4 cxd5 6. exd5 {Usual is cxd5.

Nc3 h6 {Puts the question to the bishop.} 9. Bh4 Qb6 {A bold plan to try and provoke dark square weaknesses.} 10. Qc2 O-O 11. h3 Nbd7 12. b3 {b3? is a miscalculation.

Bxf6 {Desparation.} Nxd3+ {The strongest move. Forces White to move the king.} 15. Kd1 Bxf6 {White resigns. Nxp loses the rook to Bxa1, and ...Nxf7  is threatened as well.}
