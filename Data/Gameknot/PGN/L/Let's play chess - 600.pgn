[Opening "Inverted Hanham (C44)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {The most popular set of opening moves ever played. This opening usually leads to an open game -- or at least has a better chance than 1 P-Q4 P-Q4.} 3. Be2 {An unusual variant, presumably designed to get me out of "book" play and throw me on my own resources. While it's usually true that if you can force your opponent into a variation you like and s/he is unfamiliar with you will have an advantage, I felt as if I should be able to seize the initiative after this passive 3rd move.} Nf6 {I waste no time, developing and attacking the KP.} 4. d3 d5 {White is essentially playing Philidor's defence with an extra move. In that opening, White must be aggressive: therefore, I must play strongly.} 5. exd5 Nxd5 {Now I have a central superiority.} 6. g3 Bb4+ {I press onwards, hoping to induce 7 P-QB3, wich would impede White's development. Of course, White *could* always respond with a Knight or Bishop move, but then at least I'd have a pin.} 7. c3 {He does in fact play P-QB3. Now the square is taken away from his QN.} Bd6 8. Bd2 O-O {Always castle early... especially in what looks like it will be an open game.} 9. c4 {Now White looks to seize some space. I have the K-side, so he needs to take space on the Q-side.} Nf6 10. Bg5 {Pinning, but as the pinned piece also guards the Knight, I'm not worried about the Pawns being disrupted.} Bf5 11. Nh4 Bd7 12. O-O {White gets his own King to safety.} h6 {Driving the Bishop.} 13. Bd2 Re8 14. a3 a5 {I want to prevent my opponent from expanding too much on the Q-side.} 15. Nc3 Nd4 {I take the chance to plant my Knight on a central outpost.} 16. Nf3 Bh3 {I press on, trying to exploit my spatial advantage.} 17. Re1 Nxe2+ {I win a minor exchange.} 18. Rxe2 Bg4 19. Ne4 Nxe4 {Naturally, I don't let my opponent centralize his own Knight.} 20. dxe4 Bc5 {I overlook the fact that 20...BxN simply wins a piece. My opponent must have overlooked it, too, or he would have played 19 K-N2, guarding the horse.} 21. Kg2 {Now he sees it.} b6 22. h3 {Attacking my Bishop. } Bxf3+ {I decide to play aggressively. After the recapture, my Queen will take an active role.} 23. Kxf3 Qf6+ {Now with my Queen on the same side as my opponent's King, I will try to generate a winning attack.} 24. Kg2 Rad8 {Activating my last piece. } 25. Qc2 Rd7 {Preparing to double Rooks.} 26. b4 Bd4 27. Rf1 {Sensibly, my opponent brings his Rook over to defend. But he hasn't given up on his Q-side attack just yet.} Red8 28. bxa5 bxa5 29. Bxa5 {Now he's up a Pawn. I decide to bring my Bishop back to the Q-side for defence.} Bc5 {Now the White QBP is blocked, and I still maintain my position on the diagonal.} 30. Bb4 Bb6 {My Bishop has attacking possibilities, so I preserve it.} 31. c5 Ba7 32. c6 {A mistake, unblocking the diagonal the previous move blocked.} Rd7d3 {I aim to double-attack the White KNP with my Q and R and remove the supporting KBP with my B.} 33. f4 {Well, so much for the supporting KBP. Now I'll exchange Pawns and open up the K-side some more.} exf4 34. Rxf4 Qg5 {Now my Q and R are in the positions I want. I aim to play QxKNP at some point.} 35. Rg4 {A smart defense, adding a defender to the KNP and forcing my Q to  move.} Qe5 {Still targeting the KNP.} 36. Rf4 {Blocking the Q's diagonal. However, 36 B-K1, adding an extra defender to the KNP, was better.} g5 {This move is now dangerous. If White moves his R, he opens the diagonal for my Q. R-N4 and R-B3, guarding the KNP, are the only moves that stop mate.} 37. Rf5 {Still trying to be aggressive. White's own efforts to attack here cause him to be mated in 2!} Qxg3+ {White can decide how he loses.} 38. Kf1 {He chooses the square KB1.} Qg1# {A very exciting game! One of the most fun games I've played on GameKnot.}
