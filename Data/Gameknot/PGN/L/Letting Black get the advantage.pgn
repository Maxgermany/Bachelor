1. Nh3 {This move (1) does not control center squares and allows Black to take the center with pawns and (2) develops the knight to a position that does not control KR4/h4.  The weakness of not developing to KB3/f3 will be seen.} e5 {My opponent allows me to play P-K4 as Black.  Unless White wishes to challenge the square KB4/f4, White's knight will be limited in scope.} 2. e3 d5 {Taking more control over the center with a pawn, while releasing the QB for K-side attack.} 3. Qf3 {An early Queen move that will allow Black to chase it around.  White can not challenge P-KB4/f4 right away because of 3...BxN 4 PxB Q-R4ch forcing the King to move.   White would need to make plans to Q-side castle first.} Nf6 4. Ng5 {An early knight move that has no forces backing it up.  It will be easy to chase it off and gain time developing my own forces.} h6 5. Nh3 Bd6 {Basic development, but also preparing to limit moves for the WQ.} 6. Nc3 {Time for White to retreat the Q to Q1/d1, followed by B-K2/e2.} Bg4 {The first move to trap the Queen. White can not escape loss. P-K5/e4 would also work but moves the pawn a second time w/o developing a piece.} 7. Qxf6 {Black gets one piece for the Queen.} Qxf6 8. Nxd5 Qd8 {Taking time to secure the back rank before embarking on attacks. Q-KN3/g6 or K3/e6 would be ambitious and not needed.} 9. f3 {This opens a dark-squared path against the King.} Be6 {Avoiding BxN, which would trade a good bishop for a Knight on the side of the board.  The WN has no scope unless several moves are used to reposition it.} 10. e4 c6 11. Nc3 {White's forces have all been pushed back now.} O-O {Preparing to open the KB-file for rook usage.} 12. b3 Nd7 13. Bc4 Bxc4 14. bxc4 f5 15. Rf1 {P-Q3, B-Q2, and then O-O-O would keep White solid.  The WK is now firmly set in the center of the board, which will allow for later attack.} Nc5 16. Ba3 fxe4 17. fxe4 Qh4+ {The first consequence of the centered King.   Notice how this Queen move could not be played if White developed his KN to the stronger square KB3/f3.} 18. Ke2 Nxe4 {A neat tactic to win a pawn, owing to the undefended WB.} 19. Bxd6 Nxd6 20. d3 Nxc4 {Black continues to use simple tactics to remove White's pawn protection. If 21 PxN QxBPch 22 K-Q2 QR-Q1ch 23 K any QxN   regaining the Knight and capturing yet another pawn.} 21. Ne4 {Centralizes the Knight, which is good, but also leaves White weak on the dark squares Q2/d2 and K3/e3.  This weakness will be exploited.} Qg4+ 22. Rf3 Qxg2+ 23. Rf2 Qxh3 24. Raf1 Rxf2+ 25. Nxf2 {RxR was needed to prevent mate, and to prevent the knight being pinned against the rook after R-KB1/f8.} Qe3+ {Mate next move, so White resigns.  The dark squares were an invitation.}
