[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 {The Damiano Defence, one of the worst openings for black, in my opinion.} 3. Nxe5 fxe5 {A classic mistake. Better is ( 3...Qe7 4.Nf3 d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxe4+ 7.Be2 And so on. )} 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ {There's no way to prevent the loss of the black rook now, and even trapping the queen afterward is difficult.} Qe7 6. Qxh8 Nf6 {This is the attempt to trap the white queen} 7. d3 d6 8. Bg5 {The knight is now pinned, and as I'm ahead on material I don't mind exchanging pieces.} Qg7 {? Surely Nbd7 is a better move? ( 8...Nbd7 9.Nc3 Kf7 10.Nd5 Now white would be struggling a bit to maintain its advantage. 10...Qe5 11.Nxf6 Nxf6 12.Bxf6 Qxf6 13.Qxf6+ Kxf6 Leaves white with better pawns, and ahead on material, but still a long slog ahead. )} 9. Bxf6 Qxh8 10. Bxh8 Be6 11. Nc3 Nc6 12. d4 Ne7 13. Nb5 {There's a triple fork from Nc7 here, but moving Kd7 now might have helped a little. }
