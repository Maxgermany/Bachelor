I should be developing pieces} 8. Qd2 {Is he castling queen-side??} Nxd4 {I feared Nxe6, either stranding the d-pawn or opening the f-file before I can castle} 9. Bxd4 Be7 {big mistake! } 10. Bxg7 {my rook is a "goner" } Bf6 11. Bxh8 Bxh8 {avenging my rook's demise } 12. O-O-O {Should I grab the f2 pawn?} Bxc3 {no, I'll dispose of the knight (I dislike opponents' knights)} 13. Qxc3 {the e4 pawn looks tastier than the f2 pawn} Qxe4 14. Bf3 {ok, f2 would have been better...} Qf4+ {I'll try nudging the king} 15. Kb1 d5 {I needed to block the diagonal so I could get the bishop out without losing the b7 pawn} 16. g3 {he nudges my queen} Qf5 {she stays nearby} 17.

Bxc6 {he takes the  bishop anyway...} Nxd3 {so I snatch the rook (and threaten the other rook)} 27. cxd3 {he takes my knight...} bxc6 {so I snatch his bishop} 28. Rd1 {he protects his now isolated pawn} Rd4 {I attack a backward pawn} 29. Rh1 {I think he should have just advanced the pawn...} Rxd3 {because now I grab the isolated one and I'm back to even.} 30.

Ke2 {he's persistent!} Rf4 {I back off (just a little)} 34. f3 {I suspect he's trying to link this pawn with the other two} e5 {that would be bad for me!} 35. Ke3 {the Kings get involved} Ke6 36. a4 {a bad move!} Rb4 {I try to take advantage of it} 37. Rc2 {I'm assuming he really meant to go to b2?} Rxb3+ {I grab the pawn} 38. Kf2 fxg5 {with the rook off the h-file, I can trade these pawns now} 39. hxg5 Kf5 {I probably should have went to the d-file to protect the naked pawn} 40. Rxc6 {he took long enough taking it! (I would have taken it 2 moves ago)} Ra3 {he leaves me a way to nab another..} 41. Rc5 {he pins my pawn} Rxa4 {I nab his} 42. Kg3 {he's still trying tro link the backward pawn} Kxg5 {I decide to trade before he can connect them} 43. Rxe5+ {he completes the trade, checking me in the process} Kf6 {I want to stay opposite the opponent's last pawn (and attack the rook)} 44. f4 {he proects with the pawn} Ra3+ {I check him} 45. Kg4 {where I expected him to move} Ra1 {the rook is more mobile and safer far away} 46. Rh5 {attacking both pawns} Kg6 {I protect with my King} 47. f5+ {I expected that (but I have a plan)} Kf6 {I abandon the pawn} 48. Rh6+ {he doesn't want the pawn yet (I would have grabbed it)} Kg7 {I protect my pawn and attack his rook} 49. Kg5 {he moves his King in closer to protect the rook and pawn} Rg1+ {my rook gets in on the action! (and his rook is a goner!)} 50. Kh5 {he tries to protect it, but it can't be saved} Rh1+ {check again, and the rook will die... he see the inevitable and resigns}
