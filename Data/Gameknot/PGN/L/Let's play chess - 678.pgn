1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {Odysseus, eager and young leaps out from his position along the back rank and into the fray. Do not let your eyes stray too far from his manly stature for he plays a vital role in the coming tale.} d6 3. Bc4 h6 4. Nc3 Be6 5. Bxe6 fxe6 6. d3 Nf6 {The prelimaries are now complete and quiescent Oddyseus has watched idly as his great love, Penelope, waits at home still able to discern his knightly form just a few squares away.} 7. Nh4 {Boldly, nay, heroically does Odysseus taste the edge of the world where normally a Knight fears to tread. There is no hesitation and Penelope gasps at the audacity of her young hero.} d5 8. Ng6 {Odysseus tarries not but moves forward yet again into the heart of the enemie's empire. The first to see such a far away place. He looks the opposing ruler in the eye and sneers with terrible confidence. "Here I am," he seems to say. "What will you do about it?"} Rg8 {A bold Rook flees from the awful power of brave Odysseus.} 9. Nxe5 {Undaunted, indefatigable, without remorse our hero moves for the third consecutive time, a right normally eschewed in the opening assays of battle. But he strikes, slays an enemy, and laughs at the impotence of his foes.} Bb4 {The enemy, angered by such an audacious attack lashes back.} 10. O-O {Odysseus rests for a moment and the leader of the war retreats to safety happy in the knowledge that the knight is in and amongst the enemy wreaking havoc.} Bxc3 {Odysseus' brother falls} 11. bxc3 {Vengeance is swift and sure although our hero surely weeps that is not he who brings down the sword of Damocles} Na6 {Emboldened by the foray of his enemy, a knight on the opposing side dares the edge of the world where Knights fear to tread} 12. Re1 Qe7 13. c4 dxc4 14. Nxc4 {He strikes again! Odysseus rested and ready, hesitates not and takes a second cut at the enemy. "Do you dare forget me?" he shouts.} O-O-O 15. Be3 {Penelope, perhaps in fear for her warriors life, sends an ally to help him} Kb8 16. Na5 {Ha! Bold Odysseus dares the opposite side of the world. He has traveled from one side of the earth to the other laughing at those who claim he could never achieve such glory or see such sites. "I am invincible, unstoppable," he cries out and the enemy trembles.} Qd6 17. Rb1 {Faithful allies, inspired by our heroic friend rush to his aid} b6 {Now, death stares Odysseus in the eye. Will he blink? Will he shirk his manly duties?} 18. Qf3 {Nay! Seeing the danger to her hero, Penelope leaps forward into the fray her righteus anger plain} Qa3 19. Nc6+ {Not satisified with visiting three sides of the world Odysseus boldly leaps forward hoping to claim that unheard of honor of touching the fourth and final border. My hand shakes as I write of his daring, his courage, his battle madness. But, dear reader, what is to come is not pleasant. Those of faint heart might well best be served if they turn away for a few moves. Those with a bolder spirit, read on, read on!} Ka8 {Fly, fly oh foul enemy.} 20. Nxd8 {Without hesitation Odysseus claims the final border. He spits in the eye of death. "I may fall," he seems to say, "But I will be remembered!"} Rxd8 {Alas. The terrible shrieks of Penelope wrench the air of Odysseus faces death with a stoic smile. It as if he knows he has done all he can and has no regrets.} 21. e5+ Nd5 22. c4 Qxd3 23. cxd5 exd5 24. Rbd1 Qc4 25. a3 Kb8 26. Qf7 {Grief striken for many days Penelope suddenly sees the movement of the leader of the enemy and is awakened from her mourning. Tears flow down her eyes, her legs are tired and weak but she leaps forward into the heart of the enemy territory ready to seek vengeance. But, the move exhausts her and her legs almost give out. From now on she finds that her movement is like that of the great King, slow, steady, inexorable.} g5 27. Qe7 {She staggers closer to the foe} Rc8 {Flee my wrath!} 28. Qd7 {"You shall not get away," she edges closer still. She can see the enemy head of state not far away. Blood and vengeance will her forward.} c6 29. Rdb1 Nc5 30. Qd6+ {A mere knight, dares threaten Queen Penelope? She slides again to avoid the danger and now looks the fell enemy in the eye and he trembles.} Ka8 31. Rec1 Qh4 32. Bxc5 bxc5 33. Qd7 {Back from whence she came the great Queen's energy is all but spent but she soldiers on} Rb8 34. Qxc6+ {Exhausted and all but finished, the Queen sees the moment of vengeance a single moment ahead but, the fell enemy notes the hell bent Queen, pauses for a moment, and then plunges a dagger into his own breast rather than face the wrath of Penelope who is no mood to spare him or treat his corpse with dignity. Thus ends the epic tale of Odysseus and Penelope. Perhaps, kind reader, there is a lesson for us all.}
