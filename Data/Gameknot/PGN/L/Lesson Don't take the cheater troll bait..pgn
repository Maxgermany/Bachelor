1. Nc3 c5 {So today I let my sensitive nature get in my way after I got fired by a cheating accusation in the midgame. Basically, at around the 45th move, my opponent (who've I've redacted the name in order to avoid the "naming and shaming game", though I'm happy to edit it back if the accuser continues on) accused me of using a computer. I don't have the exact logs, which were deleted by him, but the conversation went something like this: xxx: Your computer is very fast. xxx: That's right, no response. me: Wait what? me: You think I'm cheating? me: Why? xxx: Don't lie, only weak players use computers. me: I'm not cheating. xxx: Liar. me: Can you explain to me why you think I'm cheating.  At this point, my opponent deleted the chat even after I asked him for an explanation, as I wanted to sort it out with him. So there was nothing left to do but block him.  Anyway, I'm commenting this game, and I want to know from people whether my game looks like a computer, cause I sure as hell don't see it.} 2. e4 Nc6 {First two moves resembles the Dunst opening. } 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Qe2 d6 6. O-O Be7 7. d3 O-O {Basic development on my part... don't see any red flags.} 8. Bg5 a6 9. a3 h6 10. Bf4 Nd4 11. Nxd4 cxd4 12. Na2 Re8 13. e5 dxe5 14. Bxe5 b5 {Some exchanges go on, but I have a slight hold in the center.} 15. Qf3 Ra7 16. Bb3 Bd6 17. Rae1 Bxe5 18. Rxe5 Rc7 19. Qg3 Bb7 20. Rfe1 Bd5 21. Bxd5 Nxd5 22. Qf3 Qd7 23. Qxd5 exd5 {Here, my opponent trades his queen for a rook and a knight. This is a high risk exchange, but I could be in quite a bit of trouble if he plays the extra pieces right. So, keeping my cool is imperative here.} 24. Re5xe8+ Kh7 25. Re8e2 Kg6 26. Nc1 b4 {I attempt to push forward here. If white takes my pawn, I believe I can return the favor soon enough. I basically want to weaken the defense here.} 27. Nb3 bxa3 28. bxa3 Qa4 29. Ra1 Qc6 30. Rb1 {Nxd4 would have given him a free pawn.} Qc3 {Getting in towards white's left.} 31. f4 Rb7 32. a4 a5 33. Rf1 Rb4 {Keeping the pressure on, trying not to let the extra rook and knight overwhelm the queen's advantage.} 34. f5+ {He could also get a free pawn by doing Nxf5.} Kf6 35. Nxa5 Rb2 36. Nb3 Rxc2 37. Rxc2 Qxc2 38. Nc1 Qxa4 {Begin to gain more ground.} 39. Ne2 Qc2 40. Nf4 Kxf5 41. Nxd5+ Ke5 {I think it was around here, that I got accused by cheating, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I try to brush it off and move on, but the accusation broke my concentration due to the flustering. Lesson: Don't take the "cheater" troll bait.} 42. Nb4 Qb3 43. Nc6+ Kd6 44. Nxd4 Qb6 45. Rf4 Qc5 46. h3 g5 47. Rxf7 Qxd4+ {At this point, the game should be in the bag for me, but I begin to slip up from the growing weariness.} 48. Kh2 Qxd3 49. Rf6+ Kd5 50. Rxh6 Qd2 51. Rf6 Ke5 52. Rf1 Ke6 53. Kh1 Kd5 54. Kh2 Ke4 55. Rf6 Qc2 {I somehow grew the idea from my stressed mind to isolate the pawns to ensure my victory, but I begin to overlook things.} 56. Rf3 Qc7+ 57. Kg1 Qc5+ 58. Kh1 g4 59. hxg4 Qg5 60. Rb3 Qxg4 {Here is where I made the fatal mistake. I should have just kept checking the king in order to promote isolation.} 61. Rb4+ Kf5 62. Rxg4 Kxg4 63. Kh2 Kh4 64. g3+ Kg4 65. Kg2 Kg5 66. Kf3 Kh5 67. Kf4 Kg6 68. Kg4 Kh6 69. Kf5 Kg7 70. Kg5 Kh7 71. Kf6 Kh6 72. g4 Kh7 73. g5 Kg8 74. Kg6 Kh8 75. Kf7 Kh7 76. g6+ Kh8 77. g7+ {At this point, I vainly try to drag it out before I concede due to the inevitable queen promotion. Lesson: Don't take the "cheater" troll bait. I know that cheater accusations are made to the great players in order to sometimes exploit their sensitive nature, but I let it get to me, which cost me the game. I know this might sound pedantic, but I forgot the two basic rules in correspondence chess: One, never play when you're stressed, and two, it's just a game in the end.  Anyway, what would you have done if you were accused like I was? Should I have ignored him straightaway? Or tried to respond to defuse the situation? I'm open to ideas.}
