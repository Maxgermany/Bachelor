1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {Ideally, I like taking control of the center by advancing my center pawns.  I think that it gives a kind of spatial advantage.} 3. e5 c5 4. c3 {Black attacks my d-pawn so I defend.  I usually do not like moving my c-pawn to c3 because it blocks my knights optimal square, but I liked strengthening my pawn structure.} Nc6 5. Bb5 {He attacks the pawn, so I pin his knight to his king.} Qb6 6. Ba4 {He attacks my bishop so I retreat a little but I keep the knight pinned to the king.} Bd7 7. Nf3 {He defends his king and removes the pin off of his king. I think that Knight to f3 is a really good move because it develops a new piece, adds a defender to my d-pawn, and I am preparing to castle king side. } cxd4 8. cxd4 Bb4+ 9. Nc3 {We exchange pawns, he checks my king and I defend with my knight. So far, I like my position.} Nge7 10. O-O O-O 11. Bc2 {We both castle king side.  I pull back my bishop to c2 because I feel like I will be able to have a great attack on his king side with my two bishops and my queen.  } Rac8 12. Qd3 Nf5 {At this point I think I have a really good advantage, and I believed that the end was going to be near. I had a general Idea of how I was going to attack, so I threatened mate with Qd2, and he guards by moving his knight to f5.} 13. g4 Ncxd4 {I attack his knight with my pawn and he takes my pawn at d4. I felt like he was trying to go 13...Ncxd4 14. Nfxd4 Qxd4 15. Qxd4 Nfxd4 but now that I look back at this position it might have been okay to take his night on d4 because my bishop is guarding my queen so it could have been. 13... Ncxd4 14. Nfxd4 Qxd4 15. gxf5 Qxd3 16. Bxd3, this would have been fine but i did not see this at the time so I took his night on f5 with my pawn.} 14. gxf5 Bxc3 15. f6 {After he took my night with his bishop I pushed my furthest f pawn to f6.  I threatened mate again. I knew that he was either going to take my bishop or push his g pawn up. } Nxc2 16. fxg7 {he took my bishop to stop the threat of mate and I took his pawn and attacked his rook. I had a plan that I thought was full proof. } Kxg7 17. Ng5 {At this point I thought that I had the game won. I thought that I had seen every move that he could make and I thought it was over. No matter what he moved I could easily see a forced mate, if he moves his king anywhere I have forced mate and I thought that no matter what piece he moved he couldn't stop the attack but I was so into the game that I had missed a simple move.} Rfh8 {Rh8 and that guards the pawn so I can't checkmate. I was pretty shocked that I had missed that simple move, after this point the game started to get a little dangerous for me.} 18. Qxc2 {I simply take back material but I do not like my situation here first of all my king isn't very protected, my knight is probably going to be driven back by his pawns, and their is a discovered attack on my queen that can be used.} Bxe5 19. Qe2 {Yup, he takes my pawn opening having the rook attack my queen so I move it out of the way and attack his bishop.} Qd4 {I think that this move was a blunder on for black because it gave me a nice forking opportunity. black should have just guarded his bishop with his f-pawn that would have also driven my knight back.} 20. Nf3 Bxh2+ {I fork his his bishop and Queen, so he takes my pawn and checks my king with his bishop.  } 21. Kxh2 Qe4 {I take his bishop with my king and then he wants to trade Queens, which is fine by me, but first I want to improve my position just a little bit so...} 22. Rg1+ Kf8 {I go Rg1+, putting my rook on the open file and he moves his king away} 23. Qxe4 dxe4 {I felt really pressured in my situation so I was happy to exchange queens to relieve the pressure, I think he was to. } 24. Bh6+ {I wanted to develop my bishop so I could use my Queen rook so I checked his king with it.} Ke8 25. Bg7 Rg8 {I was really worried about my position and it took me along time to figure out what my next move would be. Finally the only sensible move that I saw was Ne5, getting my knight to safety and attacking his bishop.} 26. Ne5 Rc2 {This was the move that i was hoping he would not make the only thing I could do was take his bishop and if he took back with his king I would have a checking opportunity.} 27. Nxd7 Kxd7 28. Rad1+ Kc6 {When we got to this position my position not very good, if I do not do something fast black is going to take up all my pawns with his rook. It took me about 10 minutes to find the only move that could save me for now.} 29. Bd4 {I was really happy with this move, not only did this protect both of my pawns, but I was also offering a trade of rooks, which I really wanted the trade.} Rg6 30. Rxg6 hxg6 {He brings his rook to g6 and I decide to make the rook trade, I just really wanted to simplify the situation as much as I could but I new that I was in trouble because right now I think his position is better than mine.  His pawns are in a better position than mine, and I can tell that once the pawns start to come down it is going to be tough for me to keep him from queening.  I figure that if I can somehow get my king to e5 that I can somehow hold the position.} 31. Kg3 b6 32. Kf4 Re2 33. Ke5 {I was lucky that black did not really have a good way of preventing my king from getting to e5. Now that I look back at this position I realize that I like my position because all of my pieces were protected but at the time I thought that I was barely holding on.  I didn't think that I was losing but I didn't feel like I was winning. } e3 34. fxe3 Rf2 35. e4 Rf3 36. Bc3 g5 37. Rg1 f5 38. Rxg5 fxe4 39. Kxe4 Rf2 40. Re5 Rg2 41. Rxe6+ Kb7 42. a3 Rg4+ 43.
