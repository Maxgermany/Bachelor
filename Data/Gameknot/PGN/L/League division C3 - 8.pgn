1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 e6 4. Bd3 c5 5. b3 Be7 6. Bb2 Nc6 7. a3 a6 {This is an untypical move for the system chosen by black. More promising is probably b6 to complete the development of Bc8. Or cxd4, which must be done now or later.} 8. c4 {This move seem topical for the variant, but it is not found in any GK database. SF5 prefers 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. 00 00 10. c4 probably because of the fact that Qe7 is bound to defend Nf6 for some time.} cxd4 9. exd4 dxc4 10. bxc4 O-O 11. Nc3 b6 { move. The Bc8 will be needed to defend the kingside, so b6 only weakens c6. SF5 suggest Kh8, but white seems to be slightly better anyway.} 12. O-O Bb7 13. d5 {Tempting and topical. Better alternatives was probably 13. Qe2 Na5 14. Rad1 Re8 15. Rfe1 with long lasting initiative for white.} exd5 14. cxd5 {This leads to a very complicated game. Nxd5 is probably better, removing the Nf6 from the defense: 14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. cxd5 Na5 16. Qc2 g6 17. Rad1 Bf6 =} Na7 {Too passive, now white can start a very strong attack. 14. ... Na5 15. Re1 Re8 war more than enough to equalize.} 15. Ng5 {But white overpresses! 15. Ne5 was very active and would have secured a long-lasting advantage. Note that d5 cannot be captured due to the weakening of a6 field (after exchanging everything the Pa6 remains exposed).} h6 {Bad move, which weakens the kingside. After 15. ... Nb5 16. Nxb5 axb5 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 17. Bxh7+ Kh8 18. Ne6 fxe6 19. Qh5 white can get not more than perpetual.} 16. h4 {Unjustified. 16. Nge4 would have been enough to keep the advantage but white did not realize that Pd5 is still untouchable.} Nxd5 17. Nh7 {Error, based on a tactical mistake.} Re8 {Which black does not punish. After Nf4 the game was over since it will come to great simplifications followed by the loss of Nh7.} 18. Nxd5 Qxd5 19. Qg4 Bxh4 {Black blunders the checkmate in g7. It would have had the choice between - 19. ... Qxg2+ 20. Qxg2 Bxg2 21. Kxg2 with a slightly inferior endgame (the piece up of white is the bad Nh7) - 19. ... g6 20. Rae1 Qxd3 21. Rxe7 Rxe7 22. Sf6+  with repetion of moves (Kg8 cannot go to d file because of Rfd1) } 20. Qxg7# {}
