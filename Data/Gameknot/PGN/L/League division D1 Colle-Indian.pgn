If the viewers don't know, I'm a proponent of the Pirc Defense and if you don't believe me look at my Pirc annotated games} 6. O-O Nc6 7. Nbd2 {?! dubious } e5 {common } 8. dxe5 Nxe5 9. Nxe5 dxe5 10.

Qe2 {nope} Rad8 18. a4 {     ! Here is the start of my Queen-side campaign.  a4 prevents ...b5.          I wanted to keep his g7-Bishop inactive.  Also it frees my a1-Rook} a5 19. Ra3 {     !     Rook lift!} Rd7 20. Rc3 h5 {Black goes into the King-side attack} 21. Rc5 Ra8 22. Qe1 {     !     Double attack on the a-Pawn} g5 {Black continues on his attack} 23. Rxa5 Rxa5 24. Qxa5 g4 {?!} 25.

Qf3 {?!  oops Queen f2 was called for to protect the h-Pawn} Qxh4+ 33. Qh3 Qg5 34. a5 {I purse my Queen-side campaign} c5 35. c3 Qd8 36. b4 Qc7 37. Be2 {I notice earlier that I couldn't play Qxh5 due to Rh6 and my Queen is pinned but I could play Qf5 pinning his Rook.  I thought I should have played Be2 & b4 before playing Qf5} cxb4 38. cxb4 {38. Qf5?} Qb7 {A fork.  The pawn on b4 is decoy.  I don't think my opponent seen my tactic.} 39. Qf5 Qxb4 {??} 40. Bxh5 {Black resign}
