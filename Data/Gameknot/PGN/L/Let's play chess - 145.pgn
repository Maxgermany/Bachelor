1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 h6 {This move seems to waste a tempo unnecessarily.} 3. e3 e6 4. b3 Nc6 5. Bb2 Nf6 6. a3 {This was played in order to be able to bring the Bd3 without the harassment of Nb4.} a6 {Another wasted tempo.} 7. Bd3 g6 {This seems ill-advised to me.  There is no reason for Black to compromise the Kingside pawn structure.} 8. Nbd2 g5 9. Qe2 Bb4 {This seems even more ill-advised!  Black gives away a piece for no compensation.} 10. axb4 Nxb4 11. Ba3 Nc6 12. O-O g4 {Black seems to be planning a Kingside attack, but is trailing in development and material.} 13. Ne5 Nxe5 14. dxe5 Nd7 15. Qxg4 Qg5 {This is probably best.  If Black plays Nxe5, they would have to deal with Qg7.} 16. Qxg5 hxg5 {Black now has an open file against White's King, but no development to exploit it.} 17. f4 gxf4 18. exf4 b5 19. c4 {White is content to continue to trade, which will tend to magnify the advantage in the endgame.} b4 20. Bxb4 {Black gives away another pawn without compensation.} dxc4 21. Bxc4 c5 22. Ba3 a5 23. Ne4 {This wins more material, as Black has no way to defend c5 a second time.} Rh4 24. Bxc5 Nxc5 25. Nxc5 Ba6 {Black made a counting error here.  The Ba6 is attacked twice, but only defended once.} 26. Nxa6 Rd8 {This is a good move.  White can fight for the d file, but not easily while the f4 pawn is loosely defended.} 27. g3 {This gains the tempo needed to fight for the d file.} Rh6 28. Rfd1 Ra8 {A blunder.  This drops the Rook.} 29. Nc7+ Ke7 30. Nxa8 a4 31. Rxa4 f5 32. Ra7+ Kf8 33. Rd8# {Even if Black had played Ke8, Bb5+ forces this eventual position.}
