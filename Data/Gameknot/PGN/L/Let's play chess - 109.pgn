1. e4 {Gabor rom Budapest 42.  I enjoyed a material advantage for over 50% of the game but his crafty manoeuvers brought things to a stale B ending where neither side could improve on their positions.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bc4 Bg4 {Game note "Open Sicilian as black 6...Bg4". } 7. Nf3 e6 8. Bf4 Be7 {Game note "Missed the old 8...Nxe4 9.Nxe4 d5 trick".  By move 12 I clued in. } 9. h3 Bh5 10. a3 O-O 11. g4 Bg6 12. Qe2 Nxe4 {Game note "12...Nxe4!? see if this works". } 13. Nxe4 d5 14. O-O-O Bxe4 15. h4 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Na5 {Game note "16...Bxh4 so tempting". } 17. Bd3 Rc8 18. h5 Nc4 19. Rdg1 {h6 would have been annoying.  I've got a good advantage here just gotta survive his pawn advance.} Bf6 20. g5 Bxb2+ 21. Kd1 Qa5 {Game note "21...Qa5 similar move in a similar game except here I'm facing K-side pressure ...e5 would also threaten ...e4 fork of his Q and LSB".  Computer prefers 21...e5 by quite a bit (-5.83 vs -2.98). } 22. g6 h6 {...e5 still better here.} 23. Bxh6 {Computer says OK but I should have played ...Ne5 fork.  Let my advantage slip a bit so I retreated with 25...Qd2+.} gxh6 24. gxf7+ Kh8 25. Qf4 Qd2+ 26. Qxd2 Nxd2 27. Kxd2 Rxf7 {Game note "27...Rxf7 he's gonna try to get his R down to my 2nd or 3rd rank.  I gotta try to block out his LSB or trade R or use the ...Rxf2+.  Also looking at ...Bxa3"} 28. Rg6 Rxf2+ 29. Ke1 Rf6 30. Rhg1 Rxg6 {Too quick.  Should have strengthened my position with ...Re8 or ...e5.} 31. Rxg6 Bxa3 32. Rxe6 Rg8 33. Rxh6+ Kg7 34. Rh7+ Kf8 35. Rxb7 {I let him run wild.  I'm lucky to get a draw.} Rh8 36. Rxa7 Bb4+ 37. Kd1 d4 38. Ra8+ Kg7 39. Rxh8 Kxh8 40. Ke2 {He offered a draw and I accepted.}
