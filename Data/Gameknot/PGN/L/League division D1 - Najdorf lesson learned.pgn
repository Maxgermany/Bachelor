1. e4 {This game was soon after my game against darknessvisible.  I took his comment that I'd vacated the c-file too late to heart and lo!  I won, though I think I was lucky :-)} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 {The start of the English Attack, currently the most fashionable response to the Najdorf.} Ng4 {Black immediately reacts, aiming to disturb White's plans.  Because of this, Be3 is often prefaced by 6. f3.} 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 Nc6 9. Qd2 Bd7 {This was in the Gameknot database as a fairly successful move.  I'm not sure why it should be; but I thought it worth trying anyway.  I usually develop my QB to b7 in the Najdorf but I'm willing to be flexible.} 10. h3 Nge5 11. O-O-O Qc7 12. f4 {To my eye, this is now looking more like a Richter-Rauzer than an English Attack but I may have missed a key feature...} Nxd4 13. Qxd4 Nc6 14. Qf2 O-O-O {Development is numerically equal (ie 3 pieces out and castled) but White's position looks much less cramped, so I'd assess this in White's favour.} 15. g4 Kb8 {Taking darknessvisible's comment (about getting my Q off the c-file too late) to heart, I move to b8 ASAP, preparing a battery on the c-file.} 16. Bc4 {This square is frequently a good one for White against various Sicilian variations.  In this case, it immediately threatens to win the undefended f-pawn.  On the other hand, it is hanging and Black can reveal an attack on it at any time.} Rc8 {Battery now ready.  I felt that preparing attacking options was more important than defending the relatively useless f-pawn.} 17. Bxf7 e6 {Blocks the B in on the kingside, cutting it off from the defence of White queenside castled King.} 18. Bg6 Nb4 {Gesturing at White's king's position.  This didn't actually threaten anything concrete as far as I was concerned (though perhaps one of you analysers could contradict me here!), unless White cooperated.} 19. Kb1 {White, too, moves off the dangerous c-file.} Bc6 {? Black fails to see how vulnerable the Nb4 is.  In the lead-up to playing this move I had played with the idea of sacrificing the knight on c7 but concluded that it didn't work.  This was supposed to be a more conservative build up move.} 20. a3 {!  White has spotted that the N has nowhere to go.} Nxc2 {!  So Black plays the move he'd previously rejected, making the best of a bad job.} 21. Qxc2 d5 {This move releases the black-squared bishop to join the attack on White's castled position.} 22. exd5 Bxd5 {Now both bishops slant across the board at White's king.  Compare the relative powerlessness of White's prelates, stuck on the kingside with no targets, though they do control some squares that Black would like to use.} 23. Rhe1 {White centralises his KR, attacking Black's backward, isolated, but not undefended, e-pawn.} Qb6 {Black gives up hope of establishing an over-powering attack on the c-file and seeks alternative lines of attack.  The immediate threat is ...Bxa3} 24. f5 {White develops counter-chances, opening up the h2-b8 diagonal for his B and simultaneously attacking the weakling on e6.} Bxa3 25. b3 {?  White cracks under the pressure.} Bxb3 26. Qh2+ Ka8 {and White resigned, faced with multiple threats such as ... Rxc3, ...Bxd1+ and ...Bc2+ followed by Qb2#}
