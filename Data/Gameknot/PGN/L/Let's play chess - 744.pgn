[Opening "Grob's attack (A00)"]

1. g4 {I open with Grob's Attack, one of my favorite openigs. It leads to a complicated, tactical game.} e5 2. Bg2 d5 {Black counters by forming a "classical center".} 3. h3 e4 {This aggressive move means Black is trying to win quickly, and willing to leave himself exposed to a counterattack if he does not.} 4. d3 exd3 5. exd3 {Now Black's central advantage is much less -- but he has opened the King file as an attacking avenue.} Nf6 6. Bg5 {I have to develop aggressively to slow Black's attacking potential, until I can get my King off the open file.} h6 7. Bh4 g5 {This drives the Bishop, but now Black's own King-side is weakened. Perhaps he should look to castle Queen-side.} 8. Bg3 Nc6 9. Qe2+ {I hope to induce the exchange of Queens.} Be6 {Black does not cooperate, and the Queens remain. If I could have induced the exchange, I would have played for an end-game.} 10. Nd2 Bc5 11. O-O-O {With the Pawn position on the King-side, I deem it safer to put my King on the opposite flank.} O-O {Black feels differently. He places his King in a somewhat vulnerable position. However, I haven't worked up much of an attack.} 12. Kb1 b5 {Now that the Kings have taken their residence, Black begins a Queen-side assault.} 13. Ngf3 a6 14. Rhf1 b4 {I have to do something, or my protecting Pawns will be disrupted...} 15. Nb3 {...and I do.} Bb6 {Black elects to preserve his Bishop. With 15...Nd7, he could have chosen to plant a Knight on c5 after the exchange.} 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. Bxe5 {The first piece exchange leaves my pieces in a more aggressive position. My Bishop is beautifully centralized.} Nd7 {Black, naturally, wants it gone...} 18. Bd4 {I move it to a square where I won't lose the minor exchange.} Rc8 19. Bxb6 Nxb6 {Now I make the exchange. I still want to play for an endgame.} 20. Nc5 Re8 21. b3 {This finally, permanently blocks the Pawn-storming attack Black was threatening.} d4 22. Nxe6 Rxe6 {Now I win the minor exchange. Next goal: remove the heavy artillery.} 23. Qd2 a5 24. Rfe1 Qd7 25. Rxe6 {A pair of Rooks will be vaporized.} Qxe6 26. Qe1 Re8 27. Qxe6 {Now the Queens come off...} Rxe6 28. Rd2 c6 29. Bf3 Re1+ {Black himself sets up the Rooks coming off the board...} 30. Rd1 Rxd1+ 31. Bxd1 {Now I have at least a draw. Ahead a Bishop to a Knight, I just have to not blunder.} c5 32. Bf3 Nd7 33. Be4 {I centralize the Bishop.} Kf8 34. f3 Ke7 35. Kc1 {The Kings get involved, as they should. I need to centralize my King, too.} Ke6 36. Kd2 Ke5 37. Ke2 {Both Kings are centralized. Black has played the ending properly and squeezed out my winning chances. A draw is inevitable.} f6 38. Bf5 {This seals it. The Pawn position is locked and neither side can break through. If Black's King retreats with 38...Kd6, I follow with 39 Bxd7 Kxd7 40 Kf1 Ke6 41 Kg2 Ke5 42 Kf1 Kf4 43 Kf2 with the Opposition.} Nb6 39. Be4 {Black bows to the inevitable. A draw is agreed.}
