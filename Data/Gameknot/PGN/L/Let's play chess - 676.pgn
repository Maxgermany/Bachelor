1. f4 {This game i played "Birds Opening" A reversal of the "Dutch" for black. Although f4 is not necessarily whites strongest opening move, And rarely seen at the top level, I feel as though it leads to an exciting game and a very enjoyable game at that.} e6 2. Nf3 b6 3. e3 Bb7 4. b3 {Preparing to fianchetto my dark squared bishop to further my control of the e5. Eventually the bishop will also be targeting the king if my opponent decides to continue with a king side castle.} Bxf3 {This move came as quite a surprise, My opponent developed his light squared bishop only to trade it at first chance. Better would of been to continue with normal developing principles such as Nf6 or Nc6 . Also Castling king side is whites idea. So blacks light squared bishop would of been perfectly placed.} 5. Qxf3 Nc6 6. Bb2 {Continuing with my original plan of fianchettoing my dark squared bishop.} Nb4 {Threatening Nxc2+ winning the rook, This was an unnecessary move by black, Once again breaking the "Opening Principle Rules" } 7. Na3 {Protecting against Nxc2} Nd5 8. Be2 Bxa3 {My bishop is perfectly placed at the moment, Here i can win the g7 pawn, And blacks dark squared bishop, While keeping my dark squared bishop perfectly placed.} 9. Bxg7 Bb2 10. Bxb2 Ngf6 11. O-O Rg8 12. c4 {I missed this tactical maneuver. Attacking the d5 Knight, f6 Knight, And the rook. } Nb4 13. Bxf6 {Winning a piece. If 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 14. Qxa8+ Qd8 15. Qxd8+ kxd8. And white would be up a rook.} Qc8 14. Bc3 a5 15. Bxb4 {When you are up in material. You should trade of pieces and simplify the ending.} axb4 16. d4 Qa6 {I decided since my opponent can no longer castle, And i am up in material i would push and sacrifice some pawns to open up the board.} 17. f5 O-O-O 18. c5 Qa7 19. cxb6 cxb6 20. fxe6 fxe6 21. Rfc1+ Kb8 22. Qf4+ d6 23. Rc6 Qe7 24. Rac1 Rgf8 25. Qe4 d5 26. Qd3 Rdc8 27. Rxb6+ Ka8 28. Qa6+ {My opponent resigns at this point. Checkmate is now forced. 28. Qa6+ Qa7 29. Rxc8+ Rxc8 30. Qxc8 Qb8 31.Qxb8# As you can see f4 lead to quite an enjoyable game. }
