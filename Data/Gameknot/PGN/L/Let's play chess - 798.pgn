1. d4 Nf6 2. b3 d5 3. Bb2 Bf5 {This is the first time I have had someone play a London-type system against my opening.} 4. e3 Nbd7 5. Nf3 e6 6. Nbd2 c6 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. cxd3 {I am not unhappy about this position.  With good pawn play, I might have a chance to bulldoze the center.} Bd6 9. O-O O-O 10. Ne5 c5 11. f4 {Planting the Ne5 is a good step.} Rc8 12. Rc1 b6 13. Ndf3 h6 14. Qe1 Re8 15. h3 Be7 16. Kh1 Nb8 {Undeveloping might not be best.  Black may be thinking about planting the N on b4, but it could take a while, and a3 might be able to stop it anyway.} 17. dxc5 Bxc5 18. b4 {d4 also drives the B away, but allows Ne4.} Bd6 19. Qd2 Qe7 20. a3 Rc7 21. Rxc7 {I didn't want to allow the R's to double.} Bxc7 22. g4 {After some delay, I got my pawns rolling.} Nh7 23. Qc3 Rc8 {Rc8 gives me an idea.  My B-Q battery can threaten checkmate on g7, so...} 24. Nc6 {Black can't take the N because of Qxg7#.} Qf8 {This stops the checkmate, but it loses significant material.} 25. Ne7+ {After Kh8, Black loses a full R and still can't recapture because of the checkmate threat on g7.}
