1. e3 {For the record, I do not know the names of many positions. So I'll just write out my thoughts on the game..  Decent opening. Granted, it's a little hard to make a bad opening. (No insult to Gsani)} d5 {Also a decent opening.. I believe I have the French Defense in mind, but I could be wrong.} 2. d4 {So does he.} e6 3. Nc3 {He attacks my pawn, not really gaining anything, as he wouldn't sacrifice a Knight for a pawn. It could also be that he's developing it and it happens to be attacking the pawn.} Nf6 {I protect it once more all the same, at the same time developing my Knight so I have room to castle.} 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 {I forgot what this is  called. I think it had an Italian name. We both do it.} 6. Nf3 {He does it too, and we both castle.} O-O 7. O-O Nc6 {I attack his pawn, developing my Knight.} 8. a3 b6 9. b4 Ba6 {I'm trying to make him move his Rook for some reason. Nothing gained.} 10. Re1 {He does, though, instead of blocking. He intends to move his e pawn, and open up that file.} b5 11. Bb2 Ng4 {I move my Knight, making way for the Bishop. I plan to move the e pawn to attack his d pawn again, then use the bishop to assist in the take.} 12. e4 {He sees my plan and attacks d5 a second time, forcing me to keep the e pawn where it is.} f5 {12. ... Ne7 would have been a better move, but I play f5 to respond to his attack.} 13. exd5 {He attacks anyway, clearing the file for his Rook.} exd5 {I make that easy for him} 14. Nd2 {He moves his knight to make way for the Bishop. He plans to capture the pawn, protected only by my Queen.} Ne7 {I respond by moving my knight to e7, to protect the pawn, failing to see the attack I've left myself open to. I'm not talking about the Rook, either.} 15. Rxe7 {As I expected, he takes my Knight...} Qxe7 {... forcing me to take back. It is at this point I see his devious plan. IT IS...} 16. Bxd5+ {... To take d5, forking my King and my Rook. I have no way to block without losing more than I should.} Kh8 {So I move my King.} 17. Bxa8 {He takes the rook.} Rxa8 {Taking it back, I notice his King is open to attack.} 18. Nd5 {He does too perhaps but I believe he intended to take my Bishop or Queen.} Qe6 19. Nxc7 {He goes for the pawn, forking my Queen and Rook instead.} Qc6 {I move my Queen to a position where I could not only take his Knight, but get into a good attacking position.} 20. Nxa8 Qxa8 {My mistake is taking his Knight. Although this could help in the long run, it would have been simpler to move the Bishop to b7, and attack his King.} 21. Qf3 {He tries to trade Queens, and I refuse, attacking his Queen in such a way that I could gain material.} Bb7 22. Qe2 {He retreats} Qc8 {I begin moving my own Queen around to attack the King again.} 23. Qxb5 {He takes my b pawn, threatening to check my King. It wouldn't be checkmate at this point, but I protect the King anyway.} Nf6 24. Re1 {He brings in another attacker.} h5 {I open up an escape route, and take it next move.} 25. c4 {Meanwhile he's protecting his Queen.} Kh7 26. Re7 Ba8 {I move my Bishop to prepare for the attack.} 27. d5 {He moves his Bishop to a similar purpose.} a6 {I attack his Queen to get it out of the way. This is a bad move as it allows him to advance it down the board, attacking my Knight.} 28. Qb6 Nd7 {I attack his Queen, making it possible for him to checkmate.} 29. Rxg7+ {Check, forces me to move my King. I move my king to h6, allowing checkmate in the next move.} Kh6 30. Qxg6# {}
