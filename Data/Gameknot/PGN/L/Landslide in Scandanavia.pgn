1. e4 {Here White uses unusual move orders to beat the Scandanavian Defense.} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. a3 {This begins a strategy of slowly constricting Black and limiting options with flexible moves that offer transpositional possibilities to favorable positions, according to the DB.} c6 5. h3 {Here White prevents Bg4 but also lays the groundwork for an attack on the kingside.} Nf6 6. b4 {Drives away the queen and prepares for an attack on the other wing as well as possibly fianchettoing the bishop. } Qc7 7. d4 {Contests the center. Note that although Black appears to be ahead in development, White is better prepared to use the open lines.} Bf5 8. g4 {Drives the bishop away with tempo, and prepares a wing attack if Black castles kingside.} Bg6 9. Bg2 h6 10. Nf3 Be4 {Be4?! loses a tempo and the bishop pair. } 11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12. Ne5 Nf6 13. c4 e6 {At this point White is in good shape. Wherever Black puts the king, White is prepared to attack with powerful bishops.} 14. O-O Be7 15. f4 Nbd7 16. Nd3 {White decides to retreat the Knight. He wants to save it for the attack once Black decides which side to castle on.} O-O-O {...0-0-0?! While 0-0 is risky and this is common in the Scandanavian Defense main line, here White can rapidly bring every piece and a pawn storm to bear on the Black king.} 17. Be3 Rdg8 18. Qa4 Qb8 19. b5 cxb5 20. Qxb5 Bd6 21. c5 Bc7 22. c6 bxc6 23. Qxc6 {White has opened up the King. } Nb6 24. a4 {To weaken the Knight. } a5 25. Ne5 Rgf8 26. Rab1 Qa7 27. d5 {Black resigns, the attack is too strong to defend against and a piece is lost.}
