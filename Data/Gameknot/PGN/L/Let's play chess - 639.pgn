1. Nf3 {what a strange game, with Svetlana (who, btw, won very nicely the second game we played). Not really the opening, nor the middle game, but most of all the endgame. I passed by moments of rejoice and total depression about my necessity of winning the game. Please go and check the key moments of this game} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 b6 5. Bg5 Bb7 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 Bd6 8. cxd5 exd5 9. Bb5 c6 10. Ba4 O-O 11. h3 b5 12. Bc2 b4 13. Na4 Rc8 14. O-O Ba6 15. Re1 Nb6 {I am pretty sure this is a mistake by Svetlana} 16. Nxb6 axb6 17. Bf5 {because of this move} Ra8 18. Ne5 {and thanks to this double threat} Bb5 19. Nxc6 Bxc6 20. Rxc6 {+1} h6 21. Bf4 Bxf4 22. exf4 Rxa2 {0 here, but not for long of course} 23. Qb3 Qa8 24. Rxb6 {+1 again... and soon +2} Ne4 25. Bxe4 dxe4 26. Rxb4 Ra1 27. Rd1 Rxd1+ 28. Qxd1 {at this point, it should be over... I just need to maintain my two pawns ahead. This really mean that I have a problem between middle game and endgame. I fall in my own traps, and this is very difficult...} Rd8 29. Qa4 {why did I do that???? this is absurd!} Qd5 30. Kf1 {and more, why did I do this??} Qf5 31. Rb5 Qxf4 32. d5 Qc1+ 33. Ke2 Rc8 {should I be scared? No, i saw the key to get out of here} 34. Qxe4 {absolutely not! On the contrary, I'll end up with +2} Rc2+ {looks like a mate situation, or at least losing many things, but no: I have a check that will free me} 35. Kf3 Rxb2 36. Qe8+ {and this is why} Kh7 37. Rxb2 Qxb2 38. Qxf7 {again two pawns ahead. Come on, I said to myself, resign! But we still have more than hald the game to do...} Qc3+ {so now, my point is: endgame with two more points... One on the 5th line... I should win, shouldn't I??} 39. Kg4 Qd4+ 40. f4 {yeah, proud of this} Qd1+ 41. Kg3 Qd3+ 42. Kh2 Qd4 43. Qf5+ Kg8 44. Qe5 Qd3 45. d6 Qd2 46. f5 Kh7 47. f6 {i could not allow him to check on the h2-b8 line...  there are risks of perpetual check} gxf6 48. Qxf6 h5 49. Qe7+ Kh6 50. Qf6+ Kh7 {i was hesitating} 51. Qf5+ Kg7 52. d7 {ouf! finally there... but now what?} Qd6+ 53. Kg1 Qd4+ {I said to my self, the king has to join his soldier... there I'll be able to use pawn and queen to hide and go on 8th line...} 54. Kf1 Qc4+ 55. Kf2 Qh4+ 56. Ke3 Qg3+ 57. Qf3 Qe1+ 58. Kd3 Qb1+ 59. Kc4 Qa2+ 60. Kb5 Qb2+ 61. Kc6 {So, here I am, soldier!} Qc2+ 62. Kb7 Qb2+ 63. Kc7 Qe5+ {but he couldn't let me join the queen to make a cover...} 64. Kb6 Qd4+ 65. Kc6 Qc4+ 66. Kd6 Qb4+ 67. Ke5 Qe7+ 68. Kf4 Qxd7 69. Qxh5 {so impossible to join the queen... I decided to go back and join my other troops... what a job...} Qd4+ 70. Kg3 Qe3+ 71. Kh4 Qf2+ 72. g3 {first step} Qc2 73. Qg5+ Kh7 74. Qe7+ Kh6 75. Qf7 Qb2 76. Qf4+ Kg6 77. g4 {second} Qa1 78. Qf5+ Kg7 79. Kh5 Qc3 80. h4 {third...} Qd4 81. Qg6+ Kf8 82. g5 {4th...} Qa4 83. Qf6+ Kg8 84. Kg6 Qc2+ 85. Kh5 Qh7+ {there were still threats,,, dangerous ones... but I think here he missed 85. ... Qh2.} 86. Qh6 Qb7 87. Qg6+ Kh8 88. Kh6 Qd7 {difficult now for him to prevent both mate on 8th line, exchange on f6 and mate on g7 or h7... The only move to prevent mate was to exchange dramatically on f6... but then what?} 89. h5 {zugzwang...} Qc7 {Qe7 was the only move to prevent mate... but, once again, no solution...} 90. Qe8# {}
