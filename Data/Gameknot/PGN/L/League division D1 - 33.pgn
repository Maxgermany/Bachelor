1. d4 {An interesting league game, that moved swiftly to a rook endgame. My opponent played it well and some positional mistakes ended the fight prematurely. Recently I have been trying to improve my endgame, so any comments on the final third of the game are welcomed} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {Often Nf3 is played here, to avoid the Nimzo-Indian.} Bb4 4. Bd2 O-O 5. e3 Nc6 6. Nf3 d6 7. Be2 {All very standard opening moves up to now. Hardly main line variations, but no errors} e5 8. dxe5 Nxe5 9. O-O Re8 10. Qc2 Be6 11. b3 Bg4 12. Qd1 {A slow move, Nxe5 is more dynamic} Qd7 13. Nxe5 Rxe5 14. Rc1 {A slow solid move. The computer suggests Nd5} Bxe2 15. Qxe2 d5 {A weaker move. Opens my position by freeing the rook and queen with no noticeable positional gain for black. Better is Rae8 with the rook on a good open file} 16. cxd5 Nxd5 {At this point there is nothing to choose between the 2 sides, Black perhaps slightly better} 17. Nxd5 Bxd2 18. Qxd2 Rxd5 {Following the exchanges black comes out considerably better. He has complete control of the only completely open file on the board, a well placed rook and a good line of pawns.} 19. Qc2 c6 {Better than protecting with a rook} 20. Rcd1 {I decided I need to fight for the central file else I will be crushed.} Rd8 {Taking complete control, I have few good options as I cannot allow this domination to continue} 21. Rxd5 Qxd5 22. Re1 {My normal reaction to this sort of pressure is to find something dynamic to respond with. In this case I plan to push the pawn to push the queen around.} h6 23. e4 {The pawn push i planned, however looking back I can see that passive moves would be better such as h3, giving me an escape for the king.} Qd2 {Black uses his d-file domination to good effect. Following the pretty much forced trade of queens his rook sits on my second rank causing me problems} 24. Qxd2 Rxd2 25. Ra1 {I am forced to go defensive with the rook. I have to get my king into the centre, before he gets his there} Kf8 26. g3 {A slow start, Kf1 easily better} Ke7 {He continues to ease into the centre} 27. Kg2 Rd3 28. f3 {With the rook no longer needing to protect the a-pawn, I should have moved it towards the centre with Rc1} b5 {Difficult to know the intent of this move, other than maybe to make a push down that side of the board, better would be Ke6} 29. g4 {Trying to open a passage for the king to continue moving into the centre} c5 30. Rc1 {Bringing the rook back out with a tempo, attacking the c-pawn} Kd6 {Easy enough to defend however, and bringing his king towards the action} 31. Kf2 {The first bad move, I had the chance to secure the second rank with Rc2, but instead handed him a pawn on a plate} Rd2+ 32. Ke3 Rxa2 {The obvious choice of pawn to take. His majority on queenside is very worrying} 33. h4 {Moving the pawn out of the attack from the rook. Better is the Rook check Rd1 giving me a chance of moving in behind his pawns} Rb2 {Natural move} 34. Rc3 {Forced to defend the pawn} a5 35. Rd3+ {Very little else to do} Ke6 36. Rc3 Kd6 37. Rd3+ Kc6 {Ready to push the pawns forward} 38. g5 {Another poor move according to the computer. Better is e5} Rh2 {A return weak move. The rook is far better placed on the other side to help the pawns push forward. Black could simply play hxg4 then having stopped any problems can push forward the a or c pawn} 39. gxh6 {Little else to do} gxh6 40. e5 {Should have taken the opportunity to move to the 8th rank} Rxh4 {Cleaning up my pawn, leaving black with a passed pawn on the h-file to add to my headaches from the queenside} 41. Rd6+ Kc7 42. Rd5 a4 {Apparently a weak move, although the logic is good, surrendering 2 pawns for a passed pawn} 43. bxa4 bxa4 44. Rxc5+ Kb6 45. Rc8 {Forced to move behind the pawn} Kb5 46. Rf8 {The losin move, I thought I could push my pawns forward after removing the f- pawn. However this plan will leave me unable to stop his a pawn} a3 47. Rxf7 {The end is near, only possible play is to move to the b-file and attempt to force the king in front of the pawn} a2 {Calmly moving towards my back rank} 48. Ra7 Ra4 {Concluding the win, pushing on further is just delaying the inevitable}
