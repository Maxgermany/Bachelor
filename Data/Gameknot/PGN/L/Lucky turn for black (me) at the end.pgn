1. e4 {This common, monotonous, mundane, nullifying almost reprehensible move lacked the innovation i desired for an entertaining game... oh well} e5 {i countered it with the favourite of the cowards and minds of those where the kindling of a brain had never begun in the first place- i sort of just insulted myself} 2. Nf3 {he was not hampered by my decision and adhered to enhancing his control over the center of the board} d6 {unique in the sense it isn't played often but cowering in the depths and allowing the cold war style tension to bring is my cup of tea.} 3. Bc4 {shame... it appears he has plans for my pieces- a fate which isn't ideal in my opinion} h6 {enforcing my defense and playing along with my own creation of a pawn jig.} 4. d4 {oh no- now i had to make the deadly decision of allowing him to draw blood first or be taken array with this extremely tempting bait...} exd4 {couldn't resist- not really my style but through this game i do develop a ruthless personality in an urge for greater power and control!} 5. Qxd4 {rough- atleast it saVED me the burden of dutifully caRING for that measley pawn and i did expect that to happen} Nc6 {bring on my own strikem whilst simultaneously advancing my superiority in this game} 6. Qd1 {retreat- cowering among his own barracks} Bg4 {a nice pin to disable that threatening peice- but it is probably only going to be a temporary thing} 7. h3 {this person appears to have a penchant of being attacking and generally a nuisance} Bh5 {that allows me to retain the pin, unless white is foolishly willing to play g4, weakening his right hand side of the board} 8. Nc3 {there he goes, taking advantage of my undeveloped side and thus trundling on in his own fight for control in the board} Nf6 {im not to be left behind} 9. Bf4 {uh? looking at it briefly it appears to do little to my impermeable defence structure though i must grudgingly accept allows his queen and rook to connect, which can engender further threat in the approaching, daunting future of this so thrilling a game!} Be7 {an attempt to get a placid castling done to put my king away in the realms of safety} 10. g4 {this opponent is really pestering and tenacious. Atleast the advancing foolishly of these pawns reduces any chance of his king castling on this side- unless he is feeling extremely ambitious and optimistic!} Bg6 {not much choice there for me} 11. Nd2 {what's he attempting now? what can he obtain from such a move?} O-O {finally, my king tucked away relieves me of the mounting stress of a quick loss in the game.} 12. g5 {now that it is forcing me into an ugly position} Bh5 {atleast it allows my bishop to regain lost land- though im really just procastinating the following moves} 13. Qc1 {that appears to be putting white in an even stronger position unfortunately for me, as his queen and bishop, as well as his g5 pawn are neatly lined up. intimidating my h6 innnocent pawn...} hxg5 {i decided that i would rather have the swap off than the loss of a pawn} 14. Bxg5 {quite expected and the blatant correct move} Nd4 {perhaps this would permit me to get bolder on my own attack, as i do have the motives for avenging my weakened pawn structure by that bilk of a prior g6 pawn!} 15. Rg1 {that is certainly not looking good for me} Nf3+ {maybe i could last it out a little longer with a few cheeky moves} 16. Nxf3 {unfortunately it only seems to be a swap off for me and in fact aids white in the sense that it leaves the queen a free line to join in the abundant attack.} Bxf3 {the pressure on me now is almost so intense that it is almost palpable if not tangible.} 17. Bh6 {i was getting a bit conceited and pretentious by those swap offs, as i am now really stuck by the harangue engendering move of white.} Nh5 {however, it seems that i can sustain my precious defence a little longer} 18. Qe3 {that is unfortunate for my bishop} Bh1 {maybe i could tempt that rook to a side to offer myself some breathing space} 19. Bf4 {maybe not yet it appears} Nxf4 {an adequete and sufficient ecxhange in my opinion} 20. Qxf4 {we are still level in points if not in board position, giving me that fleeting hope of a victory} Re8 {pressure on the e4 pawn does seem to ideal for my advance} 21. Rxh1 {oh well, 3 points can be gained by a few enigmatic moves, summed up by a ferocious, violent attack on whites pieces!} Bg5 {2 birds with one stone.  i've opened up my rook line, as well as cojoling the queen out of my precious land} 22. Qxf7+ {here i was mislead, as this quite obvious move seemed to be omitted in my though process, preceding this move} Kh8 {not really much choice there} 23. h4 {white wants to further install and flash its strength with  the potential of a pawn and perhaps a rook threat coming through} Bh6 {an attempt to aid the security of my now extremely vulnerable king} 24. f3 {an irritating little defence, limiting the use of my rook now if the rook had emotions, they would be of lachrymose} Rf8 {though i can utilise my rook after all} 25. Qh5 {i predicted that move but we can't cry over spilt milk} Qd7 {i was no longer beating aroung the bush and was ready for my own action, instead of this infinite cowering and futile sacrifice} 26. Rd1 {at this point, the elation of white must really have reached the apex} Qc6 {a little more exercise for white's bishop appears to be the aim in black's mind} 27. Bd5 {oh great, it really did achieve very little in employing my move eralier and has given white the oppurtunity to get even more aggressive, throwing me in the state that i was begging for mercy, prepared to withdraw from this dynamic battle (losing battle for black-me-)} Qb6 {i hold my breath, awaiting whites move will he notice this forcing of obtaining whites queen if white plays the incorreect move} 28. b3 {at this point i screamed for joy- i now had the potential to win sweetly} Qe3+ {here is how it goesssss...} 29. Kf1 {white really should have blocked with his useless knight} Rxf3+ {white has now lost its queen - whoop for me} 30. Qxf3 {not much choice for white- i'm just trembling with sadistic pleasure- revenge is soooo sweet} Qxf3+ {it seems silly how im only a point up} 31. Kg1 {no i can involve my bishop and awaiting rook} Be3+ {keeping whites moves cencored and restricted is my goal} 32. Kh2 {there is whites fate} Bf4+ {i'm now preparing the guillotine} 33. Kg1 {he steps into the noose} Qg3+ {a call for the executioner by the queen} 34. Kf1 {a futile attempted flight for free freedom by the desperate prisoner} Rf8 {the executioner prevents this evasive action} 35. Ke2 {the prisoner flinches from the remedy of a glinting axe} Qe3+ {the queen asks for the prisoners last wishes} 36. Kf1 {he is petrified of the inevitable out come} Bh2+ {ruthlessly, the final wishes are forgotten and the curtains are slowly being brought down} 37. Kg2 {as white pleads for a final time for mercy, weeping for its initial foolish mistakes} Qg3# {haha- i won with an extremely enticing finish in my opinion. I treated white the way it threatened to treat me- revenge!}
