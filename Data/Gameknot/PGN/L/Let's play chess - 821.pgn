1. e4 {I started two games with ekkieandrosie simulataneously.  In this one I play black.} c5 {I used to avoid this play but I am growing fonder of it.} 2. Nf3 {This is how I respond to c4 so I've seen the resulting situations a lot.} e6 3. e5 Nc6 4. Nc3 d5 {I feel as though at this pace its going to be hard for white to regain the center.} 5. exd6 e.p. Bxd6 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. O-O Nge7 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 {I like the bishops both targeting the king. And I didn't recapture with the knight because I want it on the kingside.} 9. d4 {Now he wants to battle...} Qc7 {Threatening bxf6...bxh2+} 10. Re1 cxd4 {If knight recaptures then bxh2+ and if queen takes then bxf3 forcing gxf3 which would weaken the defense of his king.} 11. Qxd4 Bxf3 12. Ne4 {I don't understand this move. Maybe he didn't figure the bishop was worth weakening his king position but why let me just trade away pieces when I am already up.} Bxe4 13. Rxe4 {He now was big guns in the center but they are subject to harassment because of their high value.} Bxh2+ {Now comes that...} 14. Kh1 Rd8 {watch rd1+...checkmate} 15. Qa4+ {Interrupts it} Nc6 16. Be3 {Now his a-rook is defending against the mating attack} O-O {take a step back to defend and get the development of my other rook going.} 17. f4 Bg3 18. b4 Rd5 {two things. first this allows the rook to check by moving to d1 or h5. and it allows the f rook to move in behind it on the d column. } 19. b5 Rfd8 {threatening the mating attack again} 20. c4 {now queen defends against it. } Rh5+ 21. Kg1 Ne7 22. Bxa7 Bxf4 23. Rf1 {at this point he has trapped his king too much to escape without damage} Bh2+ 24. Kf2 Qg3+ 25. Ke2 Qxg2+ 26. Ke1 Qxe4+ 27. Kf2 Rd2# {and there it is. with his queen trapped uselessly behind those pawns}
