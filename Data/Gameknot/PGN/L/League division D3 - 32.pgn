1. d4 e6 2. c4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 dxc4 {This is not the usual move order at which I arrive at the accepted position and I think slightly better for white because it allows development and capture in the same move with the light squared Bishop} 5. e4 h6 6. Bh4 g5 7. Bg3 h5 {This threatens 8. ... h4 but 9. Be5 is available and a good position for white so I thought this was not only a bad use of tempo but also weakened the black g pawn.} 8. Bxc4 Nfd7 {The fear here is 9. e5 Ng4 10. h3 Nh6 leaving the black knight in a bad spot and allowing white further development. I'm not sure that simply retreating the Knight to d7 when the threat is made is better using this move as 8. ... Nc6} 9. h4 g4 {9. ... gxh4 10. Rxh4 is a double attack on the black h pawn that is difficult to counter although 10. ... Qg5 is possible with some interesting lines} 10. a3 {I wanted to avoid 10. ... Bb4 pinning my Knight for the moment} Nb6 11. Bb3 a5 12. Nb5 c6 {12. ... Bd6 13. Nxd6 cxd6 avoids the game continuation although trades the black Bishop for the white Knight} 13. Nc7+ Ke7 14. Nxa8 Nxa8 15. Bxb8 b5 {Freeing up the light squared Bishop and also setting up to push my light squared Bishop off the long diagonal} 16. Bf4 a4 17. e5 {Threatening 17. ... axb3 18. Bg5+ Ke8 19. Bxd8} Ke8 18. Bc2 Nb6 19. Be4 Bb7 20. Ne2 {My knight has been languishing for far too long and needs to get into the game} Nc4 21. Qc2 {Protecting the b pawn} Bh6 22. Bxh6 {Moderately forced as I'm in no mood to give black control of all those squares by retreating my Bishop} Rxh6 23. O-O-O {Not exactly an early castle here but I liked my Rook lined up on the d column} f6 24. Bd3 {Black's knight is the only real threatening piece at this stage and I wanted it gone} f5 {I'm not sure this was a particularly good move as it further blocks off any potential for black's light square Bishop. I thought better was 24. ... fxe5 25. Bxc4 bxc4 26. dxe5} 25. Bxc4 bxc4 26. Qxa4 {I thought leaving the pawns doubled and getting the Queen to the a4 square was far preferable to 26. Qxc4} f4 {Pushing forward with an attack I'm guessing but allowing my knight back into the game with a free capture} 27. Nxf4 Qg5 {Pinning the Knight but overlooking the capture} 28. hxg5 Rh8 29. Rxh5 Rf8 30. Qa7 {I'm always a fan of getting my Rook or Queen to the seventh rank although my material advantage is now overwhelming} Bc8 31. Qb8 Rxf4 32. Qxc8+ Kf7 33. Rh6 {Now the mate is forced} Rxf2 34. Qxe6+ Kg7 35. Rg6+ {35. ... Kh8 36. Rh1# or 35. ... Kf8 36. Rg8#. I thought the odd way we got into the Queen's Gambit Accepted was favorable to White and I was able to use my developmental advantage to force the issue on Black for most of the game. The overlooked fork which gave me an exchange advantage plus a Knight was turned into a game winner by the blunder of the Queen.  }
