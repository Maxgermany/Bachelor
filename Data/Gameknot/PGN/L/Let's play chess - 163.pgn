1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. e3 a6 {This limits the squares for White's B.} 4. b3 Bf5 5. a3 {Necessary to stop Nb4, with a double attack on the vulnerable c2 pawn.} Nf6 6. Bb2 e6 7. Be2 Bg4 {The B had a good square already at f5, so moving it twice in the opening loses a tempo.} 8. Nbd2 Bd6 9. O-O Ne4 {Another piece is moved twice in the opening before full development is achieved.} 10. Ne5 Bxe2 11. Qxe2 {White has castled and the Rooks are linked.  Black is a couple of tempos behind.} O-O 12. f4 f6 13. Nef3 f5 14. Ne5 {The point of Black's f6 to kick the N is unclear if it is going to be followed immediately by f5--which simply allows the N to come right back to a good square.} Bxe5 {Now Black exchanges the strong N anyway.} 15. fxe5 Qh4 {If Black is intending a Kingside attack, perhaps repositioning the c6 N and leading with g5 might have been an alternative.  It's not clear what the Q can do on h4.} 16. Rf4 Qh6 17. Re1 g5 18. Rff1 f4 {Loses a pawn, which might be okay if a strong attack resulted.  But the e4 N is easily exchanged and the Q is not very dangerous on its own.} 19. Nxe4 dxe4 20. exf4 Ne7 {gxf4 might have been stronger here.  It still loses a pawn after White's Qxe4, but the f4 pawn could still be dangerous.  Repositioning the c6 N would have been better before the attack was launched, not after it is losing steam.} 21. fxg5 Rxf1+ {The attacker is usually better keeping pieces on the board.  It's usually the defender who wants to exchange them.} 22. Rxf1 Nf5 {Qxg5 is mandatory--or at least something that saves the Q.  } 23. gxh6 {I think Black simply overlooked the hanging Q.  This can happen when you are too focused on your plan and don't carefully examine your opponent's counterplay.  The move isn't really representative of how well Black has played so far.}
