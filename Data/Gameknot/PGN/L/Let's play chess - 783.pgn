1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Qxd4 {Nothing uncommon.} Nc6 5. Qe3 a6 6. Be2 Nf6 7. O-O Qe7 8. c3 {A small blunder.} Qxe4 9. Qxe4+ Nxe4 10. Bd3 {The mad dance of the bishops.} Nc5 11. Bc2 h6 12. Nbd2 Be7 13. Nc4 Nd8 14. b4 d5 15. Nce5 {Black's pawns are underdeveloped.} Nce6 16. Bb3 c6 17. Be3 Bf6 18. Rac1 Bxe5 19. Nxe5 f6 {A move that achieves nothing. The white knight thrives on the black king's flank.} 20. Ng6 Rg8 21. Bb6 Kf7 22. Bc2 Bd7 23. Rfe1 Be8 24. Nh4 {A subtle move that openes g6 for the white bishop. Black does not see the danger.} Nf4 {Black defends g6 without intention...} 25. g3 Nh3+ 26. Kg2 {Now the black knight loses g6 from it's grasp.} Ng5 27. Bg6+ {27. ...Kf8  28.Bc5 checkmate. A win against a stronger opponent. I think the pair of white bishops won the day, but the white knight gave it's toll aswell. An unexpected and fortuitous victory.}
