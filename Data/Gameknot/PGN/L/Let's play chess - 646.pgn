1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 {So far so book.} 4. Ng5 {Here's where things start to get weird. This two-piece "berserker" attack is doomed to fail against proper defense. Why not simply continue developing?} d5 {Obvious.} 5. exd5 {Unwilling to admit he made a mistake.} Na5 6. Qe2 {Prematurely developing the Queen.} Nxc4 7. Qxc4 Qxd5 {At this point, he has a chance to make up for his mistake. QxQ followed by O-O and development of the Q-side is indicated for White.} 8. Qxc7 Qxg2 {Now his Rook is threatened and his King will never be able to find safety. The K-side is shattered and the Q-side is undeveloped.} 9. Qxe5+ Be7 10. Rf1 h6 {The Knight has no flight square! Now in addition to his positional disadvatages, he will face a material one as well.} 11. Nxf7 Kxf7 {My King would normally be called "exposed", but because White's Q-side pieces are undeveloped, he cannot exploit this.} 12. f3 Bh3 {Threatening QxR mate.} 13. Qe2 {Forced. But now he loses the Exchange after the Queens vanish from the board.} Qxe2+ 14. Kxe2 Bxf1+ 15. Kxf1 {I have a Rook for two Pawns, my opponent has no developed pieces, and my King is more centralized in the endgame that has arisen. White's best move here is "resigns".} Rac8 16. c3 Nd5 {Since he wants to play it out, I will simplify and simplify again. The more wood comes off the board, the bigger my material advantage looms.} 17. d3 Bg5 {The Bishops go first.} 18. Bxg5 hxg5 {Now I'd like to remove the Knights.} 19. Nd2 Rxh2 {Grabbing a loose Pawn is always good. Now a potential back-rank mate is forming up. His King is trapped on the first row.} 20. Ke1 Re8+ {If 21 K-Q1, 21...R-K7 doubles the Rooks on the 7th rank. Victory would be short and swift from there.} 21. Ne4 {This self-pin enables me to vaporize the Knights.} Nf6 22. b4 Nxe4 {Mission accomplished. Now I just have to find a way to get the back-rank mate, since my opponent refuses to resign.} 23. dxe4 Rc2 {Clearing the KR file for my Rook on K1. Intended is R-R1 and R-R8 mate.} 24. Rd1 Ke7 {Prevents the White Rook from entering on the Q file.} 25. Rd5 Rh8 {Mate is now forced, unless White gives up his Rook with 26 R-Q2.} 26. Kd1 {This just pushes everything backwards 1 move. } Rxa2 {Again, R-Q2 is the only move that prolongs the game.} 27. Rxg5 Rh1+ 28. Rg1 Rxg1# {Closing the book on this one.}
