[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {The start of "the open" game. I prefer this move, it leads to many times an exciting tactical open fight it out game.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {philidors defence.} 3. d4 {the best reply. opens up the game for lots of fun!} Bg4 {I love when an opponent makes this move. It seems to pin the knight from protecting the pawn on e5 after the capture. This is also the start of my favorite game Morphy vs the Count, made while watching the barber of saville opera sometime in the late 18 hundreds I think... Look it up.} 4. dxe5 {of course I capture anyway.} Bxf3 {the knight is taken.} 5. Qxf3 dxe5 6. Bc4 f6 {this deviates from the morphy game. here the count made the more normal move Nf6.} 7. Qb3 {this was the reply to the counts 6...Nf6 move, it still works here attacking both b7 and f7.} Nh6 {this seems to protect f7, but...} 8. Bxh6 {if black recaptures, it is mate in two....} gxh6 9. Bf7+ {One} Kd7 10. Qe6# {Two.}
