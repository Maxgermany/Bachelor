1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {thinking of fried liver attack} f6 {breaks fried liver attack totally} 3. d4 {so I bring up extra d4 pawn which is always good} d6 {extra defender} 4. Nc3 {don't really know what to do, so I do the knight which doesn't block anything} c6 {thinks of pinning my knight down with queen} 5. dxe5 {I realize I can take e5 now, het takes back left or right, either queens trade or new fried liver attempt} dxe5 {becomes queens trade} 6. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {so no balck castle possible anymore} 7. Be3 {remove black bishop for castle + check} Bd7 {anticipates that} 8. O-O-O {though he responds well, I can still pin down white bisshop, go freely to e6 and his two knights are quite blocked, so I castle} Be7 9. Bc4 Kc7 {avoiding pin} 10. Na4 {would like to get knight c5 before pawn b6 and rook on line a, losing black bishop for rook} b5 {damn didn't see} 11. Bxb5 {having the max out of this trade} cxb5 12. Nc3 a5 13. Nd5+ Kd8 14. Bb6+ {that rook becomes mine 100% sure, left or right?} Kc8 {chose Kc8, best option since he wins a move now} 15. Nc7 Kb7 16. Nxa8 Kxa8 17. Bc7 {now chasing white bishop} Bg4 {chooses to run, quite best option} 18. Bxa5 {take pawn then} Nc6 {attacking pinned down knight at f3} 19. h3 {so let's defend him from doing that} Bxf3 {wow that's really bad ... I had better done Bb6} 20. gxf3 Nxa5 21. Rd3 {don't exactly know how I'm going to configure my rooks...} Nh6 22. Rc3 f5 23. f4 {I think I have better chances then to promote a pawn once...} exf4 24. e5 {I leave that pawn for better position} f3 {???} 25. Rxf3 Bg5+ {why that?} 26. Kb1 {still believe I'm safe} Nc4 27. Rb3 Nd2+ 28. Ka1 {ok it's over. I'm bad at the end game...} Nxb3+ 29. axb3 Re8 30. Rg1 Nf7 31. h4 Bf4 32. Rxg7 Nxe5 33. Rxh7 Nc6 34. h5 Nb4 35. c4 Re1# {congrats!!!}
