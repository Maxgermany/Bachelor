1. d4 f5 {I wanted to try the Dutch.  (I wasn't too happy with how it turned out.)} 2. Bg5 h6 3. Bf4 d6 4. h4 Nf6 {I'm not very happy with this position.  I haven't been able to fianchetto my dark square B or to castle.  White has done a nice job creating a bind.} 5. Nc3 e6 6. Nf3 Bd7 7. Qd2 Nc6 8. O-O-O Qe7 9. e3 O-O-O {This is not ideal, but at least we've castled on the same side.} 10. Nb5 Nd5 11. Bg3 g6 12. a3 Bg7 13. Bc4 Nb6 14. Bb3 a6 15. Nxc7 {I was a little surprised by this, but I can see the attraction for White.  Black has a difficult job of defense.} Kxc7 16. Qc3 Kb8 17. Rd3 Ka8 {I've got to get unpinned as soon as possible.  Now I have to see if I can exchange away some of the attacking pieces.} 18. Qd2 Nd5 19. Bxd5 exd5 {I'm not happy with doubled isolated pawns, but at least one piece is now exchanged.} 20. Rb3 g5 21. hxg5 hxg5 22. Rxh8 Rxh8 23. Kb1 g4 24. Ne1 {Now most of the attacking pieces have been removed, although the B is still a bother.} Rh1 25. f4 gxf3 e.p. 26. gxf3 Bf6 27. Ka2 Bh4 28. Bxh4 Qxh4 {Bishop accomplished.  The White Q is a powerful attacking piece, but doesn't have any good squares.} 29. Ng2 Qg3 30. Nf4 Qxf3 31. a4 Qd1 {Forces the exchange of Qs, or else 32...Qa1#.} 32. Qxd1 Rxd1 {Now I am a clear piece up.  White's attack is largely defused.} 33. Nxd5 Kb8 34. c4 Rg1 35. Nf6 Bc8 36. Ne8 Rg6 {White's N is trapped and has no safe squares.} 37. c5 dxc5 38. dxc5 {Attempting to create a safe square on d6.  But it has another problem.} Be6 {This is the problem.  White will now be down a R.} 39. Nd6 Bxb3+ {White resigns, now down significant material.}
