1. c4 e5 2. g3 Nc6 3. Bg2 d6 4. Nc3 g6 5. Rb1 Bg7 6. e3 f5 7. d3 Nf6 8. Nge2 O-O 9. b4 {Advancing the b pawn to gain space on the queenside. } Rb8 {? a slight error: the best way to deal with a flank attack is to attack in the centre. Better is e5-e4. } 10. b5 Ne7 11. O-O g5 {? another positional blunder that does not quite give up the game but seriously weakens the squares in front of the castled king. The aim of this move is to play a supported f5-f4 which results in a open g file. However, I am not afraid to open the g file because I see that I can make great use of the file.} 12. f4 gxf4 13. gxf4 Ng6 {a good move that breaths some life into a dying horse. } 14. Qa4 {Not 14...Nd5 which leads to a draw by allowing black to exchange pieces to lessen black's cramped position. I played 14. ...Qa4 because I wanted to give myself a chance to win.} Ng4 {A big blunder that makes black's life very hard. The knight has abandoned d5 and does nothing to stop ...Qxa7. Both Be6 and Ra8 keep the game semi-equal. } 15. Qxa7 Be6 {Black can not afford to allow white to invade with Nd5} 16. h3 {evicting the knight before knocking of the the pawn. Which is important because if: 16. Bxb7 then 16. ...Qh4 gives black the advantage. The pawn on h3 prevents black from creating mating threats on h2.} Nh6 17. Bxb7 Qh4 {e5-e4 is better because it cuts whites forces in half.} 18. Bg2 exf4 {?? a huge error that gives up all hope for black to make a defense. } 19. exf4 {The pawn on f4 creates a massive bind in black's position. It is amazing that one pawn can render 5 pieces absolutely useless. } Rbc8 20. a4 {Because black has the vast majority of his pieces on the king side white can pretty much march a pawn to victory} Bd7 21. a5 Rfe8 22. Qf2 {Offering to remove the queens. The exchange would be in whites favor because the absence of the queens increases the strength of the past pawn.} Qf6 23. Nd5 Qf7 24. a6 Ne7 25. Nxc7 Rxc7 26. b6 Rc5 27. b7 Nc6 28. Bxc6 Bxc6 29. b8=Q Rxb8 30. Rxb8+ Bf8 31. Qg3+ Kh8 {}
