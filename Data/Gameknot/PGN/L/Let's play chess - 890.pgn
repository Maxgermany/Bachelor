1. d4 d5 2. b3 e6 3. Bb2 Nf6 4. Nf3 Bd6 5. e3 a6 {This move might be unnecessary.  Otherwise, Black's plan of development is good so far.} 6. Bd3 Ne4 {It is often useful to post a N on e4, but it may be premature if development is not completed.} 7. O-O c5 {A good pawn break.} 8. Nbd2 f5 9. Ne5 {All of White's minor pieces are now posted, while two of Black's minor pieces are still undeveloped.} cxd4 10. Bxd4 Nc6 {Black's f5 left open the d1-h5 diagonal, which can cause problems if Black has not castled.} 11. Qh5+ g6 12. Nxg6 Rg8 13. Ne5+ {Discovered check.} Kf8 {Either Kf8 or Ke7 leads now to checkmate.} 14. Qf7# {}
