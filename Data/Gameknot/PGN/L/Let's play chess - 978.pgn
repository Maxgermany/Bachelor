1. e4 {starting the gambit} e5 2. f4 f6 {this i believe is the worse way to not accept the gambit.} 3. Bc4 {continue develpoement} c6 4. Nc3 a5 {4 pawn moves for black, and this one does nothing but hurt his structure, what piece of mine is going to b4?} 5. f5 {i end the gambit and decide to launch a attack threating Qh4 } Bb4 6. d3 {i let the pin happen hoping to keep the bishop station here and away from the king} Ne7 7. Qh5+ {time to attack.} g6 {trying to slvage a castling right} 8. fxg6 Nxg6 {pins the knight for a looooong time} 9. Bh6 {not allowing black to castel, i doubt he would have but alas} Qe7 10. O-O-O {castling into it maybe but i want to pull this rook into the action} b5 11. Nxb5 {i would rather keep the bishop, so ill throw away the knight} cxb5 12. Bxb5 Qe6 {the quuen is walking awfully slow} 13. Bc4 {get back at my out post and harass the queen} Qe7 {back where it was giving white a tempo} 14. Nf3 {making room} Rg8 15. d4 {trying to pressure the middle and open it up.  (did not relize the free rook on g7 either, i just now noticed it)} Rh8 {appartly he did notice it.} 16. dxe5 {opening the rook file} Ba3 {he is hoping ill break up my pawns.} 17. Rd3 Bxb2+ {insisting i step out.} 18. Kxb2 Qb4+ {winning a bishop} 19. Bb3 {or not.} a4 {or so.} 20. Rd4 {not without a fight} Qb5 21. exf6 {you can have it now.

Qc3 {this will do it.} Rf8 {apposing me but not notiing the discoverd} 34. Rxd7+ Kg8 {only move he had} 35. Qg7# {finally, after some blunders by both players the game ends, a great case of preferal vison. }
