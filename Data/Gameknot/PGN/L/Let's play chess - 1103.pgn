1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian Defense. It's the best scoring response to 1. e4 at master level. Here, Black fights for victory. Normally, White focuses in the Kingside and Black looks for counterplay in the Queenside.} 2. Nc3 {A natural but uncommon move. Other choices are 2. d4 or 2. Nf3, that lead to extensively studied positions.} Nc6 3. Nd5 {A very weak move. There is one opening principle that is almost always true : one should never move the same piece in the opening twice in a row. It would be better 2.g3, the Closed Sicilian ( in wich White can consider fianchettoing his Bishop in g2), or 3. Nf3, wich transposes to the Open Sicilian.} e6 {Black devellops one pawn and White loses one tempo, because he's forced to move awy his Knight.} 4. Nf4 d5 {Black fights for the center. Another important opening principle : in the opening, the players must focus on occupying the center or undermine it. But fighting for the center is rather important.} 5. exd5 exd5 {By move 5, Black is better, because he has opened the lines for both Bishops and the Queen and has develloped a Knight, not mencionning the two hanging pawns. White only has one develloped Knight that is hanging in the centre.} 6. Qe2+ {Another weak move, that reminds us another chess principle : only give check if it gives you some advantage.} Be7 {Black covers the check, prepares castling and devellops one minor piece.} 7. Nh5 {Another weak move. The Knights are stronger in the centre of the board ; in the a or h files, they are weak because they only cover 4 squares, instead of the usual eight.} g6 {A move that makes White lose another tempo.} 8. Nf4 Nf6 {Black prepares castling, but with a small positional disadvantage: the a1-h8 diagonal is open.} 9. Qd3 {Another weak and time-wasting move. White should be focusing on devellopment, instead of fooling around with his queen.} Bf5 {A development move that forces White to lose another tempo ( the third one).} 10. Qc3 O-O {Natural.} 11. d3 {Finally, White shows some timid action.} Re8 {The rooks are better in open files. It also prepares a discovered check.} 12. Be3 {? A move that prevents 12. ... Bd6 !, a discovered check that would possibly win the Knight in f4 and protect that Knight.} d4 {! A strong move. The d-pawn forks the Queen and the Bishop ; White starts to lose material.} 13. Bxd4 cxd4 14. Qc4 Bd6+ {With the white Bishop gone, the discovered check is now possible. It is also a double attack, since the bishop threatens to smash the white horse.} 15. Be2 {?? A terrible blunder that loses more material. The correct move would have been 15. Nge2, that would protect the white Knight in f4, or as Heizkat suggests, 15. Nfe2.} Bxf4 16. g3 Bh6 17. f4 {A move that opens new lines, wich is good for black, but leaves the black Bishop in h6 inactive.} Rc8 {A move that prepares a discovered atack in the queen.} 18. O-O-O {White castles in the queenside - but he's already two minor pieces down.} Bg4 {A move that forces the exchange.} 19. Qb5 {A weak move. White loses time in threatening a pawn.} Bxe2 20. Nxe2 Rxe2 {Black keeps winning material. Instead of eating pawns, White should have focused in defense, with 19. Re1.} 21. Rd2 {White proposes one rook exchange, wich is a terrible move, because Black has a huge material lead.} Rxd2 22. Kxd2 {The white King is now exposed.} Bf8 {The black bishop suddenly becomes active again.} 23. c3 dxc3+ 24. bxc3 {The white king protects himself from the Bishop of the dark squares.} Ne4+ {A great move ! White can't smash the Knight because his d-pawn is pinned by the Queen.} 25. Ke2 {A gigantic blunder, but White hasn't got much choice. At this point, the game is lost for White.} Nxc3+ {A nice Royal Fork that wins the white queen.} 26. Kd2 Nxb5 27. Rb1 Na3 28. Rxb7 Nc4+ 29. Kc3 Qd4+ 30. Kb3 Nc6a5+ {Another fork that kills even the wildest dreams of White.} 31. Ka4 Nxb7 32. Kb5 Na3+ 33. Ka6 {A forced move.} Qb6# {A somewhat unpretty checkmate.}
