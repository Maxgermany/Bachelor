1. f4 {I love this one... it's one of those obvious checkmates that you would love to be able to give to someone, but any decent player today would not let you do it to them.... } d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 {at this point everything is quiet.....but if black castles on his king-side he might face a strong attack...} Bd6 {Exactly what i thought - he wants to castle fast......} 4. Bd3 {A questionable move... but i wanted to put pressure on H7...} Nf6 {he goes on with his plan to castle asap....} 5. b3 {now i reveal my intentions...... i wanted a double bishop attack on both pawns protecting the king (H7 & G7 pawns).} Nc6 6. Bb2 {following my plans.....} O-O {he castles anyway... } 7. O-O {I do so too... and clear the E1 square for the queen, so that it can later go to H4....} Qe7 8. Qe1 {sticking to the plan......} Nh5 {I think he hoped the i would let him keep that knight there just until he can open up with F7 pawn to F5... Nonsense... } 9. g4 {thanks for the tempo....} Nf6 {I was here just a minute ago...} 10. Qh4 {!! sharp move} e5 {hoping it will save him....} 11. g5 {putting the heat on....} Ne4 {he blocks my bishop....} 12. Nc3 {I attack... } Nxc3 {he takes it......} 13. Qxh7# {obviously he didn't see it coming .... otherwise he wouldn't have moved the knight on E4... }
