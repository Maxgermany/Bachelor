1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 {So here have we the petroff (petrov's) defence.} Nxe4 {A common mistake for unfamiliar or unwary players of the petrov.} 4. Qe2 Qe7 {This is black's best move.. obviously moving the knight fails to Nc6 double check, winning the black queen.} 5. Qxe4 d6 6. d4 Nc6 {Black's trying to save a pawn.. clearly white dominates the initiative.} 7. Bb5 Bd7 8. Bg5 {!} f6 {Obviously Qxg5 loses to discovered checks.} 9. Nc3 {Another shocking move! The threat of Nd5 is quite strong!} dxe5 {Black's best try was Nxe5. } 10. Nd5 Qd6 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. O-O-O O-O-O 13. Nxf6 Qe7 14. Nxh7 Qe6 15. Bxd7+ Rxd7 16. Rxd7 Kxd7 17. Nxf8+ Rxf8 18.
