1. e4 {Tried and true.} e5 {One of the most common responses.} 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Here both knights are attacking their respective pawns, white has the slight upper hand of the first move.} 3. Nxe5 {He takes that initiative.} d6 {My counter was simple, force him to return...} 4. Nxf7 {Unless of course he does that.  I can't afford to allow him to take a rook or queen so I must take with my King.  } Kxf7 {I have lost my right to castle and my King is more than a little vulnerable} 5. d4 {Opens up his bishop for attack and strengthens his center.} Be7 {A plan to set up something that looks like I castled and get my king a little out of danger (quite hopeful am I not?).} 6. Bc4+ {I expected this move as it makes sense that he would like to take advantage of his prior moves.} Be6 {I counter with an attack with my bishop.} 7. Bxe6+ {I did not suspect this move.  Perhaps better would be to lay off this move and either  Qd3 or Bb3.  Either could cause some future problems for black.} Kxe6 {Still this can be called some serious problems.} 8. Qf3 {I have to find a way to get my King out of the unprotected center of the board.} g6 {Hmmm.. I seem confused.} 9. d5+ {Yuck.  } Kf7 {I started returning to my previous plan.} 10. b3 {This could spell trouble as all of his attackers will soon be pointed in the only real direction that my King may have a little protection at this point.} Re8 {My continuation.  Similar to a castling.  Normally I would have preferred Rf8, but then Bh6 would have caused me to waste time, and I am already behind in time and position.  In this case both E and F files are half open so E is best.} 11. O-O Kg8 {Unfortunately, my king is most safe here.  Not one of my ideas of a fun situation.} 12. Bh6 {I expected him to take advantage of the b2 Diagonal... This is effective though.} Bf8 {I offer the trade giving my rook my preferred postion afterwards.} 13. Bg5 {He recognized the perils of the trade, and he has pinned my knight to my queen and he was already attacking the knight with the queen.  I must supply support.} Nbd7 {I was not sure what to expect but I figured I could later use my bishop for support later if needed.} 14. Nd2 Bg7 {This give me the option to use the D7 knight; however, it does not releas my knight from the pin persay.} 15. Rfe1 {Trying to work his rook around all of his pesky pawns.} Ne5 {Attack of the queen.  I need him moved just a hair at least.} 16. Qg3 Nf7 {I attack the bishop.} 17. f3 {Here taking the bishop does not quite get the desired results.  } Nh5 {I attack his queen with the knight that was pinned to my queen. } 18. Bxd8 Nxg3 {Now I finally have the tempo in my favor.  He is playing catch up.} 19. Rab1 Bc3 {Pinning the knight.} 20. Red1 Bxd2 {Fairly important to capitalize on this specific pin.} 21. Rxd2 Nxe4 {Wasted.  Not really.  If I simply move my knight off I lose the tempo.  Here I force him to move his rook once again} 22. fxe4 {Okay so not the rook but you get the idea.} Raxd8 {not taken until it was time.  Note that all this puts me ahead 2 in points, but look at the position at this point.  very workable for black finally.} 23. Re2 Ng5 {Atacking the pawn 2 times he must supply support or take the loss of the pawn.} 24. Rbe1 {I hoped he would supply support.  I have a little extra opportunity.} Re7 25. h4 {This is a little cumbersome to my plan... Perhaps I should have taken the F file when I had the chance a play ago.  } Nf7 {knight is right back where he was before.  Sigh.} 26. g4 {Advancing his pawns.} Ne5 27. g5 {The pawn was what I was hoping he would see.} Nf3+ {He resigns.  Behind by 4 could present problems given the board situation.}
