1. e4 c5 2. d4 {Starts out as the Scisillian.. Lets see what happens} cxd4 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bd7 {Bd7? I am beginning to like my position} 6. Bc4 g6 7. Bg5 {Lets put some pressure on that king side. } Bg7 {Black opts for the sniper game, but lacks any coordinated attack. I feel no threat at this point in the game, and opt to castle while considering my plan of attack} 8. O-O O-O 9. a4 {I was a little out of good moves here. Maybe start an attack on the queen side can open things up?} Nc6 10. Nxc6 {Black tries to reconquer the middle, i won't allow it, and removes his Knight that could support his bishop at g7. } Bxc6 11. f3 a6 12. b4 {As soon as I made this move, i thought that Black might go for the Rook at a1. Looking at how my pieces all where lined up for the king side assault, i thought this is the time to strike, let this be a trap. With the queen at a1 and a bishop at h6 it would be a short game.} Nxe4 {The plot thickens..} 13. Nxe4 Bxa1 {From this point on, it is a loosing battle for black..} 14. Qxa1 {Notice how the queen has access to the king, just need the bishop on h6} Bxe4 {Great move (for me). Now the pressure can be increased by moving the f-pawn out of the way} 15. fxe4 {Notice all the attack lines toward the king side, just need to move that bishop to h6} Qb6+ {That was the only move left for black} 16. Kh1 e5 {Without this move, he would have been mate really fast. Block the queens path to the king.} 17. Bh6 {Now the focus of the attack is moved to the black f-pawn} Rfe8 18. Rxf7 {From here it is a mate by moving Rf8} d5 19. Bxd5 {Keep the pressure from the bishop} Re6 20. Qf1 {This move brings the queen back in play with an additional mate opportunity} Qd6 21. Bxe6 {Black resigns. The next moves would be 21: .. Qxe6 22: Rh8+ Rxh8 23: Qxh8++}
