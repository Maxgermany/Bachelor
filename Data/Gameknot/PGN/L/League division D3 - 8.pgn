[Opening "Two knights defence (C57)"]

1. e4 {Said to be "The best by test" I'm actually not that great against it so maybe it's true.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {All standard so far (and boring, I need to learn the Sicilian properly someday).} 3. Bc4 {Well this is new to me. I'm used to Bb5 or Nc3 which probably explains my mistakes in the next few moves.} Nf6 {At the time I was unhappy with this move. I still am, but according to the 'book' (which I didn't consult until after the game) it was entirely correct.} 4. Ng5 {Ugh! Knights forking pieces is one of my pet peeves, you'd think all my mucking around in the Chess Tactics section would have taught me to watch out for them but noooo...} Qe7 {The 'book' response is d5 which leads to a very tricky game, I considered it but didn't like my initial read so this was the only other option to defend the fork.} 5. d3 {Opening up the dark-squared bishop to protect the knight. My gut feeling says this is a wasted move at this point - better to press the attack with Bxf7+ forcing Kd8 and threatening to fork with Nf7+} d6 {Looking to get the light-squared bishop in on the action. Without the Queen on d8, d5 is no longer an option} 6. Bxf7+ Kd8 7. Bb3 {Setting up for Nf7+} Bg4 {The best form of defence. However White defends this, I get to cover f7 with my Bishop and I can breathe easier.} 8. f3 Bh5 9. Nc3 Na5 {At this point, I'm still not happy with the position but we're now past the early crisis and I want to kill this bishop. I'm always happy to exchange knights for bishops and if I can make an opponent double his pawns into the bargain then so much the better.} 10. g4 Bg6 {I'll admit to having mentally flipped a coin here. In hindsight, I should have gone Nxb3 and if either axb3 or cxb3 used the tempo to get my bishop clear or if my bishop was taken, capture the rook on a1. Either way is good.} 11. h4 {I'm honestly not sure where this move came from. I presume my opponent was looking for h5 to pressure my light-squared bishop but I still have the initiative to deny it. Watch this space though, that pawn will be critical shortly.} Nxb3 12. axb3 h6 {The only escape is Nh3, effectively trapping the knight out of the way.} 13. Nd5 {??? Not only will this cost White a knight for nothing but as we'll see, in combination with his pawn on h4 the position is now extremely precarious.} Nxd5 14. exd5 hxg5 15. Bxg5 {This is the move that unlocks the deadly potential of h4. On a surface reading, this play wins my queen for a bishop. In truth however, the opened h-file will be fatal to White's position.} Qxg5 16. hxg5 {Disaster strikes! I'd had something like this in mind since 12. ...h6 but it didn't become inevitable until 15. Bxg5.} Rxh1+ 17. Kd2 Rxd1+ 18. Rxd1 {At this point, while the points difference isn't so massive, initiative and position favour me entirely, resignation is a matter of time.} Be7 19. b4 Bxg5+ 20. Kc3 Kd7 21. b3 Rf8 22. Rf1 e4 {One final forcing exchange to settle the issue.} 23. dxe4 Bxe4 {White resigns. As you can see this was neither my, nor my opponent's finest game. It is however interesting to see how a seemingly innocuous move (h4) can open you up to sudden disaster in the game of chess. Certainly one to remember and beware.}
