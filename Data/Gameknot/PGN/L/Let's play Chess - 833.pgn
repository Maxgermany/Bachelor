[Opening "Petrov (C42), French attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Nc6 {This is a line of the Petroff that, while unsound from Black's perspective, contains a number of tactical traps for white to fall into, e.g. 4.Nxc6 dxc6 5.e5 Ne4 6.d3? Bc5!} 4. Nxc6 dxc6 5. Nc3 Bc5 6. Be2 {This is important: while black can often regain the pawn, white is left with a good position. 6.Bc4? Bxf2+ (or ...Qd4) is another trap.} O-O 7. O-O Re8 8. d3 b5 {There is alomst nowhere for the c8 bishop to go, since ...Be6 cedes control of e5.} 9. a3 Bb7 10. Be3 {While exchanging off the good bishop is generally a poor idea, this provides central reinforcements and opens up the f-file.} Bxe3 11. fxe3 Qd7 {Preparing ...c5 and ...Rd8. Black has real problems finding any activity.} 12. Bf3 Rad8 13. Qe2 {Both players are focusing on bringing peices to useful squares, but for black this is difficult due to the lack of squares.} a6 {I (as black) had definately messed up this opening, and I didn't really go about helping this in the next few moves.} 14. a4 b4 15. Nd1 c5 {Black has the beginning of a central blockade, but white is clearly better; he should currently be planning an attack.} 16. b3 Re7 17. Nb2 {The knight will re-enter the game with an excellent outpost on c4.} Qe6 18. Nc4 h6 {A waiting move: there is little else black can do.} 19. Rae1 {Presumably, my opponent was planning a breakthrough in the centre, commencing with Pe5.} Nd7 {Due to the better positioning of white's peices, this mistake costs black the exchange.} 20. Bg4 Qg6 21. Bxd7 Rexd7 {Black's peices are poorly co-ordinated and outnumbered.} 22. Ne5 Qe6 23. Nxd7 Rxd7 {I contemplated resignation at this point, but black has drawing chances and white could easily become weak on e4.} 24. Rf5 Qb6 25. Ref1 {White is quickly piling on the pressure. Nevertheless, by virtue of accurate defense and counterattack, black is able to blockade the position.} f6 26. Kh1 {The rationale for this move is to prevent a counterattack in the centre when the queen moves, but it is too slow. Black gains a free tempo, and in fact this move makes white weaker later when he is defending.} Re7 {Aiming for e4 and preventing white advancing the e4-pawn.} 27. Qh5 Kh7 {Threatening ...g6.} 28. a5 {Now if 28...Qxa5?, 29.Rxf6! gxf6 30.Rxf6 and white is unstoppable. Although the pawn on c5 is tempting, 28.Rxc5?? g6! leaves black actually winning!} Qd6 29. Rf5f2 {This retreat seems rather weak; 29.Qh4 would carry the potent threat of 30.Rxf6!} Bc8 {Bringing the bishop to an ideal diagonal, ironically where it was originally, and preparing a counterattack with the pawns.} 30. Qf3 Rf7 31. Qf4 {Exchanging is sensible, but there is no obligation on black.} Qe7 32. e5 {This move, more than anything, costs white the win, because it allows black to create a complete blockade.} f5 {Black now has excellent drawing chances in view of the barrier he can form across the board.} 33. e4 g5 34. Qd2 f4 {White now has minimal space to maneuvre, and doesn't really help himself.} 35. g3 Bh3 36. Rg1 f3 {The king is trapped in the corner, and black can breathe freely. } 37. Re1 {...Bg2+ was threatened, although it would not really have been a good idea: it could have opened up the game again.} Qxe5 38. Re3 g4 {The f2 is the worst peice: completely unable to move. Black now begins planning an attack.} 39. Re1 Rd7 40. Qe3 Rf7 {Black has wasted two moves, and it has not cost him anything; this is a mark of how claustrophobic white's position is.} 41. Kg1 h5 42. Rd1 h4 {The attack is unstoppable: black aims to get his queen to g3, whereupon white is mated easily.} 43. gxh4 g3 {44.hxg3 Qxg3+ 45.Kh1 Bg2+ 46.Kg1 Qh3 47.Re2 f2+ 48.Qxf2 Qh1#} 44. Rxf3 {I hadn't planned for this, but it didn't take long to see:} Rxf3 {Distracting the queen.} 45. Qxf3 Qd4+ 46. Kh1 g2+ {The queen must give herself up to avoid mate.} 47. Qxg2 Bxg2+ 48. Kxg2 Qc3 {Although, in terms of material, white is not all that far down, he will be quickly, since the c2 and d3 pawns will inevitably and immediately fall, with more to come. Therefore, white resigned.}
