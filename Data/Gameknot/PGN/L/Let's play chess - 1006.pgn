[Opening "Queen's pawn game, Chigorin variation (D02)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bf4 {The London System.  One of my standards from the white side.  A very versitle opening that tends to focus on solidifying the center and seeking out opprotunites to lauch flank attacks (at least the way I play it).  White still maintians the option of transposing to a queens gambit by playing c4 although the bishop will be misplaced for some QG variations and white should be very careful in making that decision.  I did state Saturday, after the tournament, that I'm begining to become frustrated with the sometimes stagnant and frankly uninspired games I've been getting out of this system lately.  I'm starting to favor sharper, more tactical opernings and that has reflected in my email chess paterns as I shift back and forth from 1d4 to 1e4} e6 4. e3 Bd6 5. Bg3 {There are 2 primary schools of thought among London players here.  My play of Bg3 invites a trade where I would recapture with the h pawn putting early pressure on the king side.  The other option would be to pin the night on f6 (in this position after I play Bg5, black would most likely transpose into that via Nf6).} Nf6 6. c3 {long term, if I decide to play in the center, I will push on the e file, not the c file.  c3 helps prepare for that.} O-O 7. Bd3 Ne4 {this push into the center is premature and quite frankly, I think the knight is better served helping to defend the king side.  Unless things change soon, I will begin advancing on the kingside} 8. Qc2 f5 {His best attempt to maintain the current position.  He has transposed to the Dutch defence, but has some problems.  Primarily, his night needs to be on d7 not c6 with the idea that it swings over to f6 to support the posted night (it is also preventing the c-pawn from reaching c6 where it needs to be).} 9. Nbd2 Nxg3 {bad!  very bad!  As mentioned before, this knight probably was better served staying home and defending the queenside.  Even still.....in the current position, his knight is posted nicely in the center and is essentially unmoveable while my bishop isn't really doing much at all.  If you're going to trade here, do it with the bishop.} 10. hxg3 Qf6 11. O-O-O h6 {premature and weakens the light squares.  A pawn sacrifice on g4 later on to open up the light squares now becomes a very dangerous and viable option for me.  It's almost like he's trying to defend against my attack before I even make it.} 12. Rh5 Kf7 {why run so early?  Actually the King comes in handy in helping to hold things together.  Black should continue development and prepare to attack on the queenside.} 13. Rdh1 Ke7 {....at least from the castled position, he was safe behind the pawns.  Here, he's waisted valuable time and is right out in the open.} 14. Nh4 {preparing to take advantage of the light square weakness.} Rh8 {Bd7 was almost a MUST here, he's got to get those squares covered!  The point of this move was to play g6 believing my rook would be trapped.} 15. g4 {the obvious tactic is fxe5 16. Ng6  wins the rook clean.  If the pawn is not taken, it will be pushed to g5 attacking the queen and h pawn with the pawn pinned to the rook.} g6 16. g5 {this was an increadibly sharp combination and one of those positions I looked over about an hour at work one night to make sure I didn't miss anything.  Blacks only option here is Qf7 or Qg7 and both aren't really that great.  If the queen does go to g7 with the idea of recapturing the pawn after Rxh6 Rxh6 gxh6 he would fall into a discovered attack after recapturing (Nxf5  and the rook wins the queen)} Qg7 17. Rxh6 Rxh6 18. gxh6 Qf6 {As stated before if 18. ... Qxf6 19. Nxf5  wins the queen.  Guess he realized it at the last moment.} 19. h7 {another very sharp tactic!  if the Q gets directed to h8, Nxg6 forks king and queen} Kf7 {Best attempt would be Bd7 although you still fall victim to the same theme dropping a rook for a knight and pawn.  Black does get a little counter play from that variation though.....  20. Nxg6 ! Qxg6 21. h8=Q (could be really mean an underpromote to a knight forking the Q and K but it still get's traded off) Rxh8 22. Rxh8 Qxg2} 20. Nxg6 {Nxg6!!  Now the rook is guarding the queening square along with the knight preventing Kxg6.  Also if Qxg6 21. h8=N  forks the king and queen.} Bd7 {too little, too late} 21. h8=Q Rxh8 22. Nxh8+ Ke8 23. f4 {wanting to close off the center for good and prevent any counterplay} Bf8 24. Qd1 Kd8 {Once again, my opponent seems to have a stong aversion just to being checked.  Why run so early?  Continuing with Bg7 (even though it fails to Qh5  and either Nf7  or Ng6  followed by the knight escaping to e5) or even begining an attack on the queenside would be better.} 25. g4 {oh well....if I don't have to worry about defending the knight now, I'll just make more room for myself....} Be8 26. gxf5 exf5 {I gave some thought to advancing instead of trading, but I'd have a tough time getting through those bishops.  I'll just continue to consolidate material.  Getting rid of the e-pawn has now opened several targets for me (especially the now isolated f pawn).} 27. Qb3 {forking the 2 pawns at b7 and d5....} Bg7 {things are getting out of hand for black to the point that I'm not sure what to recomend.  I would have likely resigned after the loss of the rook on h8.....} 28. Qxd5+ Ke7 29. Qg8 {saves the knight...} Bf7 {oooops...drops another pawn} 30. Qxf7+ Qxf7 31. Nxf7 Kxf7 32. Bxf5 Ne7 33. Be4 c6 34. Nf3 Kf6 35. Ne5 Ke6 36. Rh7 Bf6 37. Kd2 {black resigns}
