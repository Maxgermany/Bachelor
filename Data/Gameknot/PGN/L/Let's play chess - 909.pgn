1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 {English Opening} b6 {Black is out of book here. He clearly plans to fianchetto his bishop, perhaps as attempt to discourage White from a Bg2 fianchetto, which is common in the English.} 3. g3 Bb7 4. Nd5 {Nd5 allows time to develop Bg2.} Bc5 {Bc5 threatens a Bxf2 sacrifice which would prevent a future Castle.} 5. e3 {e3 protects against possible Bxf2 sacrifice or threat from Qf6 after Bxd5.} Nf6 {Threatens Knight on d5.} 6. Bg2 {Protects Night on d5.} c6 7. Nxf6+ Qxf6 8. Qf3 Qxf3 9. Bxf3 {Material even after exchanges.} O-O 10. b3 {b3 offers the option of playing Bb2 later.} Re8 {Re8 protecting e5.} 11. e4 {11.e4 prevents 11...e4} Bd4 12. Rb1 Na6 {The only option to develop the Queen side Knight.} 13. Ba3 {Preemptive move to protect b4 and c5 from Knight occupation.} Nc5 14. Bxc5 Bxc5 {Material even after exchange.} 15. Bg4 {Allow for Knight development, make the Bishop more useful and threaten d7 pawn.} d6 16. Nf3 {Develop Knight for Castle.} a6 {a6 is in preparation of a future 17...b5. } 17. O-O b5 {There is no advantage for White to trade pawns here with 18.cxb5 because it frees up the a-file for the Black Rook.} 18. Rfd1 {Preparing for d4.} a5 19. Kg2 g6 20. a4 {a4 was an attempt to allow Black to either exchange pawns in order to open up the b-file for my Rook, or lock up that side of the board which is what he later chose to do with 20...b4. If he would have left the b5 Pawn alone I would have left it alone also for fear that cxb5 would free up his Bishop to attack.} b4 21. Rb2 Kg7 22. d3 {Avoided d4 because the prospect of trading a Knight for a Bishop in a game with locked Pawns was not in my favor. I also expected ...d5 eventually and wanted the opportunity to open up the e-file for my Rook in a Pawn exchange if dxc4 or dxe4.} h5 23. Bh3 {Bh3 is the only safe place for my Bishop. I did not want to exchange Bishops because my Bishop had more attaching potential but if challenged I would have had no choice but to exchange them.} Kh6 {Kh6 shows the plan to push his g and h Pawns.} 24. Nh4 {This move was important because it supported my plan to eventually move my King to f3 and later give my Bishop the option for escape if attacked. } g5 25. Nf5+ Kg6 26. f3 {f3 protects against 26...g4. } d5 {Black is possibly hoping for a cxd5 or exd5 but it is to my advantage that he would dxc4 or dxe4 so I wait.} 27. g4 {Offer exchange to free up my Bishop. I worried about 27...h4 which would have made my Bishop worthless, but perhaps Black was not interested in locking up Pawns on both sides of the board and wanted to open the game up a bit.} hxg4 28. Bxg4 f6 29. Kg3 {Kg3 is in preparation of h4.} Rad8 30. Rbd2 {Double up d-file Rooks in anticipation of an eventual ...dxc4 or dxe4.} dxc4 31. dxc4 Rxd2 32. Rxd2 {Material still even after exchanges but White has a slight positional advantage.} Bb6 {Bb6 seems to be protecting d8 in anticipation of a Rook exchange.} 33. h4 {Push h Pawn for exchange in an effort to give my King more breathing room.} gxh4+ 34. Kxh4 Rf8 {Black recognizes 35.Bh5  and moves the Rook that would have been captured otherwise. What is missed is the potential for a fork on the 7th Rank when the King is forced to retreat. The option of exchanging Rooks with 34...Rd8 was available but possibly even better was 34...Rh8  which would have forced 35.Kg3 } 35. Bh5+ Kh7 36. Rd7+ Kh8 37. Rxb7 {White is finally ahead in material with plenty of opportunities available.} Bf2+ 38. Kh3 Rd8 39. Rc7 {The plan is to pick off some pawns and free up the 6th Rank.} c5 40. Rc6 Rd3 {40...Rd3?  The plan to advance the b Pawn is understandable, but considering the current situation it would have been better to forgo attacking the b3 Pawn and instead attack with 40...Rd1 and later 41...Rh1 or 41...Rg1.} 41. Rxf6 Rxb3 42. Kg4 {Protect against Rxf3} Rd3 43. Bf7 {Finally, an opportunity for a forced checkmate with 44. Rh6. Black Resigns.}
