[Opening "KGA (C34), Fischer defence"]

1. e4 {In this game I applied Bobby Fischer's bust to the king's gambit. Gambit accepted and pawn defended. As Fischer puts it "Thank you, Weaver Adams!"} e5 2. f4 exf4 {Gambit accepted.} 3. Nf3 d6 {This is the variation promoted by Fischer. Not exactly his invention but he studied it well.} 4. d4 {According to the variation white should have played 4. h4.} g5 {and since he hasn't done so black can defend the pawn.} 5. h4 {At this point this move is a bit too late.} f6 {I left the king quite open but there was really nothing threatening in the next few moves.} 6. d5 {6. d5 was good as it opens up the right side of black but the next moves by white force him into defense.} Bg4 {Black is forced into the defense from the very first few moves.} 7. Be2 Qe7 8. Nc3 Nd7 {The knight move opens up for castling and prepares for Nc5 which is a good strategic position.} 9. Nd4 {A good move by white attacking the white bishop and preparing for Nf5 and the more formidable Nb5 which would be hard to defend.} Bxe2 10. Qxe2 a6 11. hxg5 fxg5 12. Qh5+ Kd8 {I don't mind not castling. Just my way of playing. So this move didn't hurt me much.} 13. Nf3 {White regains the white lost pawn and creates a good attack which could lead to Kf7+.} Bg7 14. Qxg5 {Not the best move in my opinion. I thought NXg5 would have been better.} Bxc3+ {Fewer knights are easier to play against in such an open game and trying to reduce the defense of white's e pawn.} 15. bxc3 Nc5 16. Qxe7+ Nxe7 17. Ng5 Rg8 18. Bxf4 Kd7 {I didn't rush into defending my pawns because I felt I could recover them while gaining more ground as can be seen the next few moves.} 19. Rxh7 Rae8 20. O-O-O Kc8 21. c4 Ng6 22. Rf7 {With this move white game was basically over. Moving back the bishop would have left the game more even.} Nxf4 23. Rxf4 Rxg5 24. g4 Rxe4 25. Rf7 Rgxg4 26. Rh1 Re8 27. Rhh7 Rxc4 28. Rfxc7+ Kb8 29. Rcf7 Rd4 30. Rh5 Na4 31. Rf1 Nb6 32. Rd1 Ra4 33. Kb1 Nc4 34. Rh3 Rc8 35. Rb3 Na3+ 36. Ka1 Nxc2+ 37. Kb2 Nd4 38. Rb6 Nb5 {The rook here is trapped.} 39. Kb3 Re4 40. a4 Rc3+ 41. Kb2 Rb4+ {So whether this is what Fischer meant by saying by 'the king's Gambit loses by force' or not I'm not sure but 3. ... d6 is a powerful move.}
