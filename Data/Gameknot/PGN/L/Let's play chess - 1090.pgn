O-O-O {Blacks' pieces are all defensive. The Bishop on b7 is useless because of 0-0-0, and the Knight on d5 has no place to go. But the position is equal. If I want to catch the Knight, I must first take away the sqare b4, and then I can push the deadly c4.} a5 17. a3 c6 18. c4 Rc8 {After Nc7 I have an attack with Bxg6 Qc8 Bxh7  Kh8 Bf6  Bg7 Nh5...} 19. Kb1 {To get away from the pin.} b5 20. cxd5 cxd5 21. Qe2 b4 22. Bb5 {I have a piece more, so I go on exchanges.} Bc6 23. Bxc6 Rxc6 24. Bxe7 Rxe7 25. Rdc1 Rb6 26. a4 {To keep closed the lines.} b3 27. Nd4 Reb7 28. Nb5 Qd7 29. Rc3 Rb6xb5 30. axb5 Rxb5 31. Rd1 {Make a pin, otherwise getting back the Knight into the game is too long.} a4 32. Ne4 Qb7 33. Nf6+ Kg7 34. Ne8+ {I missed a very good chance. I wanted for the first look, changing the pieces - now the Knight on d6.} Kg8 35. Nf6+ Kg7 {It is just my luck, that black repeats. Maybe he thought, I go for the three-repetition.} 36. Qh5 {Now everything is over.} gxh5 37. Rg3+ Kh6 38. Ng8# {}
