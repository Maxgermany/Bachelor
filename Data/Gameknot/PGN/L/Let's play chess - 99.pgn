[Opening "Petrov (C43), modern (Steinitz) attack"]

1. e4 e5 {I explained that this was one of the most common response to 1.e4.  Of course, I said that to keep her away from the Sicilian Defense.  Jack's logic behind it was because it's most analyzed by Masters and Grandmasters.  But, GM Susan Polgar said, in one of her lecture, that it's not a good reason to play the opening.  Instead, you should play the opening that you have the most experience, and this is what Erika has the most experience with.  I wanted to start off with simple things when I started mentoring her. } 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Now, it becomes interesting as this is the Petrov Defense.} 3. d4 {? This is a mistake from white, as it ought to lose a pawn.  Best was 3.Nxe5, and after 3...Nxe5 4.Qe2, despite black being forced to retreat, it's still even.} d6 {With that being said, best was 3...Nxe4, picking up a pawn, at once.} 4. Nc3 {Meanwhile, woelfman continues with his development.} Nc6 {As does Erika.  But, white has a surprise for black.} 5. d5 {And, it's with this move.  Although things are even, this is going to cost Erika a tempo, and white has a solid pawn chain, or as Erika calls it, a pawn wall, in return.  With that being said, white now has a very small advantage.  As that's what GM Susan Polgar pointed out in the French Defense, in a variation where you also attack the N with d5, with a pawn right behind it, being on e4.} Nb4 6. Bb5+ {?! But, this check is uncessary and should throw that tiny edge away.  I think that white delivered the check just because it's possible.  But, black can force the Bishop back and gain tempo.  Ok, how should black proceed, Erika?} Bd7 {Well, this is one way, but it's passive.  Best was 6...c6 forcing it back.  In the aftermath, black could still bring this Bishop into play.  } 7. Bg5 {And, woelfman starts getting aggressive by pinning the Knight.  Of course, it's not bad, yet.} h6 {Trying to break the pin as the idea here 8.Bh4 g5 9.Bg3.  However, this was not the best way to go, as white will get an exchange that benefits him.  In general, a Bishop is favorable over a Knight.  I know this because of more lessons from Susan Polgar of when and where to exchange.  And, she mentioned that a B should not be exchanged for a N without a good reason.  In this case, it could have been avoided.  So, best was to break the pin with 7...Be7.  Not only does black Erika prevent white from exchanging, but black is also continuing with her development and preparing to castle, which she mentioned in one of her recent annotations.  } 8. Bxf6 gxf6 {!? Much better was to use the Queen by recapturing with 8...Qxf6.  As this move not only limits the mobility of her Bf8 and Queen, but it also destroys her King side pawn structure which leaves her King vulnerable to exposure.  In a lecture, Susan mentioned that when you have the option of how to capture, you're much better off taking back with a piece or the Queen, then the pawn in front of where you castle short.  As this is also where the doubled pawns can become quite dangerous for the reason that I mentioned in my second sentence.} 9. a3 {Hitting, and pretty much, trapping the Knight.} Nxc2+ {?? Erika didn't just play this to place her opponent in check, but black thought that she was winning a pawn.  However, this is her first big blunder, as this will lose a piece in return.  Even though I don't like exchanging, best 9...Na6, and after exchanging, things are still even.} 10. Qxc2 h5 {Opening up another square for her Rh8.} 11. g3 {Stopping Erika's h pawn from advancing any further.} Bxb5 {But, I would not have exchanged here.  As this is liquidation.  It's important to remember that it's not a good idea to liquidate when behind.  As you saw with charleshiggie's most recent annotation, the idea is that when behind, "exchange pawns, not pieces".  This favors white since you'll have less to defend with later on.  Believe it or not, this is something that elyhim also stressed to me in a mentoring game.  That is, before I even reached an 1100 rating.} 12. Nxb5 c6 {? Going after the Knight.  But, it's a mistake that will cost Erika another pawn.  Better was 12...Bg7 or 12...Be7 which also continues with her development and still allows her to castle.   Not only does this move lose a pawn, but black will lose her right to castle, when all is said and done. } 13. dxc6 bxc6 14. Qxc6+ Ke7 15. Rd1 {With that being said, woelfman goes after another pawn.} Rc8 {? And, this is how she protects it.  But, it is, yet, another mistake, as this will cost Erika a pawn.  Best was 15...Ke6, and that pawn is protected by her Bishop.  Not only that, but black could later protect a7 with ...Qb6.  Of course, white would liquidate, but it's better then losing more material which is about to happen.} 16. Qb7+ Ke6 17. Qxa7 Bh6 {?? Doing what she can to stay in black develops.  Although black was lost, this ends the game even faster and is the worst blunder.  Of course, there are no good moves left, anyway, but this move is going to lose an additional Queen+Pawn for a Rook+Knight leaving black at a greater disadvantage.  Although it loses another pawn, 17...d5 was essential.} 18. Rxd6+ Qxd6 19. Nxd6 Kxd6 20. O-O {In fact, didn't just castle to bring his monarch to safety which is the general reason for doing so.  Instead, woelfman now has a devastating attack which he will take advantage of.} h4 21. Rd1+ Bd2 {21...Ke6 or 21...Kc6 would've kept Erika in this game a little longer.  But, black is still lost, as then white would be able to pick up, yet, another pawn with 22.gxh4.  But, with this move, it's mate in 2.} 22. Rxd2+ Ke6 23. Qd7# {Overall, Erika played better then usual.  But, destroying her King side pawn structures was not so good.  Then, she took a pawn on her 9th move, but overlooked 10.Qxc2 which lost another piece.  From then on, it was gonna go downhill for black, and after losing another pawn or two, black was busted.  The important lesson to be learned is to not, voluntarily, exchange on the King side where you're about to castle, and to ask yourself if what you're about to take is defended by another piece, Erika.  If it is, then it's not a good idea to take, unless you have another attacker.  But, counting how many attackers you have against how many defenders he or she or visa versa; so how many attackers they have against how many defenders you have is an important part of becoming a better player.  This is something that my coach has stressed to me. }
