1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 4. Qa4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 {This gives you a backward pawn on an open file. It's not a problem at the moment, but it could be later. An alternative was 5...d6, followed by ...g6.} 6. Nf3 {Threatening 7.e5.} Bb4 {An excellent move. As well as developing a piece, it threatens 7...Nxe4. If White plays 7.e5, then 7...Nd5 looks good for Black.} 7. Bd3 d6 8. O-O Bd7 {Now was the time to play 8...Bxc3. White is forced to recapture with the pawn, ruining his pawn structure and giving you something to attack.} 9. Be3 a6 10. a3 b5 11. Qb3 Bxc3 {11...Bc5 looks better.} 12. Qxc3 O-O 13. b4 a5 {A faulty plan, since White ends up with a much more active rook. 13...Rc8 aiming at the queen and the backward pawn on c2 was best.} 14. Bxb5 axb4 15. axb4 Rxa1 16. Rxa1 Nxe4 17. Qd3 Nf6 {This is your first bad move. 17...d5 was the obvious move, but 17...Nxb4 may also be playable.} 18. Qxd6 {White now has a winning advantage.} Ne4 19. Qd3 f5 20. Qc4 Ne7 21. Bxd7 Qxd7 22. Ne5 Qd6 23. Bf4 {23.Nd3 would have closed off Black's access to d1 and enabled the White rook to get into the game.} Rd8 24. g3 {Nd3 was again the best move.} g5 25. Nf7 Qd7 26. Nxd8 gxf4 27. Nxe6 {27.Qxe6  would have given White an easy win.} Kh8 28. Nxf4 {I think 99% of the chess-playing population would have played 28.Ra8  first.} Nd2 29. Qe2 Qd4 30. Qxe7 Qxa1+ 31. Kg2 Qf1# {}
