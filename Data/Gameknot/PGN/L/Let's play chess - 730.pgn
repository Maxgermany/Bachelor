1. e4 {standard and most popular opening probably in the world, caro kann,sicillian or match it now?????????} e5 {i match it, now this gets intersting, will I be thrown into the ruy or a bishop's or what?} 2. Qh5 {Ah, basic scholar's mate attack} d6 {Protect the pawn, standard works fairly decently} 3. Bc4 {yep, going in for the traditional scholar kill} Qe7 {only problem is that ruddy black piece with horns on its head blocked it} 4. d3 {ow........this all of a sudden has a potential to get very ansty very fast. Bg5, is striking down the alley} Nf6 {good save especially since when I was playing this game I didn't even see the potential of Bg5, i just want that queen out of there now} 5. Qh4 {hooray,she went away!} Nc6 {time to develop, should be more focused on castling kingside at this point or possible queenside. i'm not sure quite which is better.} 6. Nf3 {in coming knight errant and a castle is about to pop out of the earth} Nb4 {fork attempt. Keyword attempt, why he doesn't respond with Na3 I'm not sure. Hey, it's attack, i should probably be more worried about my safety what witha bishop and queen aiming for my jugular.} 7. Kd1 {ah, but counterattack leads to counterdefense and thus a balance in play. why not Na3 to protect the square and save castling rights here I'm still not sure.} a6 {protecting against bishop check on b5, probably just a waste of time.} 8. a3 {chasing the bab bad scar scary knight away. After all everyone is afraid of the big bad knight} Nc6 {run away it's a scary peasant with a pitchfork!} 9. Ng5 {twang. I'm shot. trouble strikes with a capital T} b5 {urk........apparently the words bishop and check haven't sunk into my vocabulary yet.} 10. Bxf7+ {yep, darn tooten!} Kd8 {drive by Burger king} 11. Bh5 {ok, now I'm going to be real mean and set up a nasty forky for all you good little boys and girls!} Nxh5 {One way to stop an attack kill the protector!} 12. Qxh5 {Only problem is there's a new one. let's see if we can take care of that shall we.........!} g6 {tada, super beaverpawn to the rescue!} 13. Qf3 {ah, another supprt angle........hmmm......} Be6 {Protect the church!} 14. Nc3 {developing an attack which I'll probably totally miss} Nd4 {ah, the power of counterattack!} 15. Qg3 {Save the emperoress!} h6 {oh yeah and horseman get lost!} 16. Be3 {Develop, the bishop for another counterattack!} hxg5 {The horseman just become an headless hooligan ,oh yeah and in doing so brough about the demise of the army of shadow} 17. Bxg5 {Twang. game over. Or is it. My number one chess philopshy: NEVER RESIGN!} Qxg5 {Cutting losses into mincemeat} 18. Qxg5+ {The Butcheress!} Be7 {Blocking the knives of steel} 19. Qxg6 {George just became a goose sandwich for the tyrant!} Rg8 {Burning into the danger zone!} 20. Qh5 {3 strikes and your out in the old ball game!!!!!!!!!1} Kd7 {you have got to be joking BBBBGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG44!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!} 21. Re1 {now I'm laughing, this is one of those cases where the first person who finds the play actually wins!} Bg4+ {yep, bout time to, I could of thrown away a total win there!} 22. Qxg4+ {cutting losses and evening it out in the bottom of the 9th!} Rxg4 {strike !!!!!!!!!!1} 23. f3 {march pawns , march!} Rxg2 {die pawns die!} 24. Nb1 {nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My knight is facing an invisible attacker! Best move here is to block the fork.} Nxc2 {yep, right on schedule, and your,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,out!!!!!!!!!!1} 25. Re2 {oh yeah now It's time to block} Rxe2 {sweet.........I'll trade more of them!} 26. Kxe2 {Oh yeah, I forgot about that poor boy in the corner........whom nobody loves} Nxa1 {THUNDERBOLTS AND LIGHTNING VERY VERY FRIGHTENING!} 27. Nc3 {Save yourselves!!!!!!!!!!!!} Nb3 {I can't wait to be on the road again!} 28. Ke3 {You can run but you can't hide.............!} Bg5+ {The Killer Preists!} 29. Ke2 {Run Away! The clergyman has gone mad!} Rh8 {Speed rook, speed!} 30. Nd1 {I'm going to block this little check here with my little furry pack animal} Rxh2+ {CHECKDA CHECK!} 31. Nf2 {Drink the water.........drink I say!} Nd4+ {Z Knight is in the house.ya!} 32. Kf1 {Hide and seek time} Nxf3 {That's what I call a pawn sandwitch!} 33.
