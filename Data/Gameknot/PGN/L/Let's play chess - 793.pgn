[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian.} 2. e5 {This was a surprise. I can't say I've seen it before and I didn't know how to react.} d5 {I think I had a pretty good solution. White's choice is whether or not to take d5 by en passant. If he does, his center pawns will be weak, and this is what I was gambling on.} 3. d4 b6 {In retrospect I should have taken d4, forced his queen out for risk of losing a pawn, and then developed Kc6, putting black ahead in development and with initiative.} 4. Nf3 Bf5 5. c4 {c4 indicates that he is planning to attack my d4 pawn.} e6 {Into the damned French Defense. I use it only sparingly, since I always feel claustrophobic. Thankfully I freed my Queenside bishop first. Still regretting not taking d4 earlier. It becomes my primary target in the moves to come.} 6. Nc3 {Still planning to attack my d4 pawn.} Ne7 {This move seemed safest. I considered living dangerously with dxc4, but it left too many question marks.} 7. Bd3 dxc4 {Black's main goal here is to open up the board. The French Defense is feeling a little constrained, and I'm tired of being on the defense and not having initiative.} 8. Bxc4 Nbc6 {Another carefully deliberated move, and part of a larger plan to take d4.} 9. Bb5 a6 10. Bxc6+ Nxc6 {This exchange was engineered to give me dominance over the d4 pawn. It's been my primary target almost since it was put there. } 11. O-O {11. Be3 would have saved the d4 pawn.} cxd4 {Success! I'm able to take d4, I free my Kingside Bishop to develop, and now I'm up a pawn, and it's a passed pawn to boot.} 12. Na4 {A mistake. This loses the knight.} b5 13. Nb6 Qxb6 14. Bg5 {This development doesn't betray White's new goals, should he have any. I wonder what he plans to do? He doesn't seem to have many avenues for attack.} g6 {I have an open banquet here. My new goal is to trade off the f3 knight. I'd like to keep the bishop pair, but it looks like I'm going to have to use a bishop to do the trade. Even so it looks like my best option for doing that is to fianchetto. That will also free up the king so I can finally castle, which I've put off so I could accomplish my previous goals.} 15. Bf6 {... but it turns out to be a mistake.} Rg8 16. Nxd4 {Clearly a blunder. I don't mind losing the passed pawn so much, since I get his last knight in return. It also makes my goal of trading the Knight kinda moot.} Nxd4 17. Re1 {Another blunder, sets himself up for a fork.} Nc2 18. a4 Nxa1 {A1 rook is taken so that the White queen gets stuck in a corner behind his own pawn.} 19. Qxa1 g5 {Trap the White bishop in. He can't move it lest it be captured. Now I have to figure out a mating scenario.} 20. a5 Qd4 21. Rd1 Qb4 22. Qa3 {Exactly what I wanted. I couldn't figure out any way to force a queen trade. And this way I get a pawn out of it.} Qxa3 23. bxa3 Bxa3 24. h3 Be7 {I can't figure out any way of getting at the King with the pieces I have. I've got to free up my other rook, and that means trading off the black square Bishop. It removes my bishop pair advantage, but I have a passed pawn to make up for that, and perhaps soon I'll have two.} 25. g4 Bg6 {I analyzed this carefully to make sure it can't get trapped back there behind a white pawn attack.} 26. h4 {f4 instead could have won a pawn.} Bxf6 {Finally I can free my g8 rook. It's been held there so that it could keep White's bishop in place, which doesn't make sense that a Rook is tied up pinning a Bishop. Now I can move in with it by clearing up the g and h pawn.} 27. exf6 Rd8 {He seemed to have no problem trading when he is nine points behind, so I figured I'd make it a bit easier for him.} 28. Rxd8+ Kxd8 {Having traded all of his pieces, he is left with no offensive material and he resigns. Good game, quite enjoyable.}
