1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d5 {Without e6 being played, this advance is possible.  It puts Black on the defensive immediately, although White also has to pay attention to development.} Na5 4. e3 d6 {Black neglected to counterpunch in the center, or to create an escape square for the misplaced N.} 5. b4 Nc6 6. dxc6 bxc6 7. Bb2 Bf5 8. Be2 e5 9. O-O d5 {Black has a healthy center, but let an important center pawn hang.} 10. Nxe5 Bxb4 11. Nxc6 Qd6 12. Nxb4 Qxb4 13. Bxf6 Be6 {Black feared that gxf6 runs into Qxd5, but this simply surrenders another piece.} 14. Bd4 O-O 15. Nd2 {White is now fully developed, but has two extra pieces.} c5 16. a3 Qb6 17. Rb1 Qd6 18. Bc3 d4 {Taking aggressive action in the center when at a significant disadvantage seems optimistic.  } 19. exd4 cxd4 {Black resigned here, possibly seeing that Bb4 wins more material.}
