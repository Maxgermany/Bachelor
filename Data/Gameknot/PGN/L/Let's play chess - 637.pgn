1. e3 {Hello, this is my first annotation and I've decided to annotate this game because after an absolute howler, involving me gifting my queen away to my opponent (i really wasn't thinking) with no consequence for him, i proceed to win the game...somehow. This will not be an in-depth analysis, as i only really play chess for a bit of fun and never bother putting too much thought into my moves, but instead just my thoughts on the game, feel free to comment...} e5 2. a3 d5 3. Qh5 Bd6 4. Qd1 {Not quite sure what his plan was with his queen, but oh well, I'll gladly accept the extra tempo. As it turns out his lack of development of all of his minor pieces at these early stages probably proves his undoing in the end.} Nf6 5. b4 Nc6 {i think I'm ahead here as i have three developed pieces to none, and I'm ready to castle} 6. Bb5 {this move is now less powerful than usual, as i was about to castle anyway} O-O 7. Nc3 b6 {WHAT AM I THINKING? as i said i tend to play instinctively rather than bother to put much thought in, but this is the first of my two big mistakes, and it really cripples my early position, and i waste a lot of moves trying to rectify that} 8. Bxc6 {my opponent capitalises} Rb8 {the only way to protect my rook} 9. Bxd5 {i decide i don't like that bishop in this menacing position, so it's time to get rid of it before it does any more damage!} Nxd5 10. Nxd5 c6 {perhaps not the best move, not sure?} 11. Nc3 Qg5 {now that I've freed up my position it's time to develop some more} 12. Qf3 h6 13. Qxc6 {this sets alarm bells ringing, as my opponent's queen infiltrates my ranks, leading to...} Qxg2 {BOOM the mistake that should have cost me the game, in my defense, i was thinking, fight fire with fire, he may take my bishop but i can get at least a rook, of course that would only be true if he couldn't take my queen, and just as i pressed submit, i noticed 'oh yeah WHOOPS his queen can take mine!'} 14. Qxg2 Bb7 {aiming to get some compensation for my losses} 15. f3 {the only way to save his rook} f5 {from now on i just try to develop my pieces and see where that gets me, the one good thing is that he may have a +13 material advantage, but his development's currently a bit static} 16. Bb2 a6 {following here are a series of what i believe to be lots of small mistakes from my opponent that...eventually let me back into the game} 17. Na4 {mistake #1 leaving the knight unprotected} Bc6 18. Qg6 {mistake #2 i guess he thought he could put pressure on my bishops?} Rf6 {this drives his queen away losing him a few tempos and gains an extra tempo for me as it allows me to double my rooks eventually} 19. Qg2 {and of course this allows me to regain some of that material i lost} Bxa4 20. Qe2 {putting pressure on my pawns, but again wasting time by him, we've reached twenty moves and he hasn't developed three of his pieces nor castled} b5 21. O-O-O {mistake #3 although it develops a piece, he doesn't use it to good effect and it brings his king into a potential line of fire} Rc8 {immediately applying pressure on the king} 22. Bc3 Be7 {the plan was to get to f6 with my bishop} 23. Kb2 Rfc6 24. Qd3 Bf6 25. Kb1 {not sure what he was trying to do by moving his king around? seems like he's just wasted a move? and allowed me to put pressure on his queen/bishop} e4 26. fxe4 Bxc3 27. exf5 {i think he would have been better off taking my bishop? at least it would have linked his queen and rook} Bf6 28. Qd7 {this enables me to put serious pressure on his king, winning me at least a rook, or as it turned out, the game!} Bxc2+ 29. Kc1 {in attempt to save material loss, he hands me my mate in 2! i'm not sure if perhaps it still would have been mate had he played Ka2?} Bd3+ {BOOM...checkmate} 30. Qxc6 Rxc6# {WOW, not entirely sure how i managed to win that game, but basically i think it shows how important development is, his knight and rook still haven't moved, and had they been developed properly, they probably would've helped him see off my attack. but after losing my queen i was ready to give up, and it goes to show that chess can still be fun even when you're down a massive material amount, thanks to mcr1973 for a fun game!}
