[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D00)"]

1. d4 {Hello, today I will annotate a game between two 1300s players. This game was a long one, but black came out much better in the end. Beginner players should look at this annotation, because it highlights some of the most important mistakes and misconceptions made by them.   White begins d4, the queen pawn game.} d5 {double d pawn opening. One important rule in these double d pawn opening is:  Don't block the c pawn with a knight unless necessary. Why? Because the c pawn's advance to c4(c5 for black) will ensure a breakdown of the opponent's d pawn, and thus breaking down or at least pressuring the pawn. Also, if it is possible in dd openings, the knight behind the c pawn will give that side more space and an easier game. The c-pawn gains central space.} 2. h3 {a waste of time. Inexperienced players do not know when to play this move. a3,a6,h3,h6 should only be played when there is a reason to play it.Reasons include:  1.A piece may go there with a THREAT  2.The king needs an escape square. 3.it may be necessary to support other moves in some positions. 4.it restricts a piece's only good square  here, none of these apply. One more thing is, don't play that just to stop a bishop from pinning a knight. If the bishop has no more good squares,  or the pin is a threat, then the move may be necessary. } Nc6 {Playable, but black may have a space shortage if white plays well.} 3. Nf3 {perfectly ok.} Nf6 4. Bf4 {white's setup can be something like  e3,c4,Nc3.. with good play} Bf5 {this is a good square for the bishop, and now h3 is looking completely useless.} 5. e3 e6 6. c4 {now black may be having a space shortage, or at least his center is under pressure.} Bxb1 {Not good. Bb4ch can be met by Nd2 and a3. Black has given up the bishop pair, generally worth half a pawn.} 7. Rxb1 Ne4 8. a3 {yes. Now Black is really threatening to play Bb4ch, forcing Ke2, where his pieces may have trouble getting his pieces out. good.also, the space gaining b4 is an idea.} h6 {But this is useless.} 9. Be2 {just developing} g5 {a weakening move, but it seems ok, because now the bishop can fianchetto, and black can castle queenside.} 10. Be5 {this gives the bishop pair without being forced to.} Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Qd6 12. c5 {not good. The d pawn is overloaded, trying to support c5 and the e5 knight. This is an important point. When looking at a position, ask yourself:  What are all the seeds of tactical destruction? these are:  1.pieces or pawns that must multitask.  2.loose pieces(unguarded)   think about if you can exploit any of this.} Nxc5 13. dxc5 Qxe5 14. b4 {black stands reasonably better} Qc3+ 15. Qd2 Qxa3 16. O-O Bg7 {black is up 2 pawns, and is winning.} 17. Bf3 Bc3 {When up in material, it is not important to make threats. The correct move is maybe castling. Also, attacking with 2 pieces against an army spells disaster.} 18. Qd3 {the pawn is immune, and there are no good discoveries moving the bishop. } Bxb4 {blunder!!!!!! after Qb4+ black's bishop, which is attacked once and guarded once, is loose, because one more attack with a piece with tempo will win, and I see Qb5ch almost immediately, and black has 3 pawns for the bishop but better development, and after Qb5ch, white has the advantage. If black had just guarded his position, he would still be winning.} 19. Qxa3 {double blunder. Now White lets black escape.} Bxa3 20. Rxb7 Bxc5 21. Rxc7 Bb6 22. Rc6 O-O {black is clearly better. he has 2 extra pawns.} 23. Rd6 {unfortunately for black the rook cannot be trapped. } Rfd8 24. Rxd8+ Rxd8 {white is completely losing.} 25. Rb1 Rc8 26. Bg4 Rc4 27. Be2 Ra4 28. g4 e5 {black must do 2 things:  1.get his king (worth 4 points of attacking power) into the game instead of advancing the pawns immediately  2.then get the a pawn rolling.} 29. Rb5 Ra5 30. Rb1 Ra2 31. Bf3 d4 {get that king out!  I'm getting dizzy from this. I might make some calculation mistakes.} 32. exd4 Bxd4 {fine. Both captures are good. Now black has a strong bishop, and he can activate the king and advance the a pawn, but he must watch out for 7th rank checks. He can develop the king to f6-e6-d6-c5} 33. Rb8+ Kg7 34. Rb7 Ra5 {take the pawn!} 35. Be2 {white is losing, and should get his own king out.} Ra2 {it will be tough for white to get his king out now, because of the rook. } 36. Kf1 a5 37. Bc4 {bad. The b} Rxf2+ 38. Ke1 e4 39. Rd7 {the} Be3 {the pawn on e4 can be won} 40. Re7 Rf4 41. Ba2 {No Bd4. But white is losing to badly and needs a miracle.} Bc5 42. Rc7 Bb4+ 43. Ke2 Rf3 44. Bd5 {now black will lose the pawn} Rf4 {the pawn will fall} 45. Ke3 Rf3+ 46. Kxe4 Rxh3 47. Rxf7+ Kg6 48. Rb7 Rh2 49. Bf7+ Kf6 50. Bh5 Rb2 51. Rb6+ Kg7 52. Kf5 Rf2+ 53. Ke4 Rf4+ 54. Ke5 a4 55. Rg6+ Kh7 56. Ra6 a3 57. Bg6+ Kg7 58. Bh5 Bc3+ 59. Ke6 Rf6+ 60. Kd5 Rxa6 {I will give the rest without comments}
