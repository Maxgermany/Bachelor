1. e4 {Kings pawn opening.} e5 2. Qf3 {Scholars mate? White should be careful not to under develop.} Nc6 3. Bc4 {Now it's mate in one if black doesn't respond correctly. } Nf6 {Stops scholars mate. White can't play Qxf6 because blacks queen is prepared.} 4. d3 d6 {Black might need this pawn here later to bring out his light squared bishop.} 5. Bg5 Be7 {Backing up blacks knight. Now the knight is attacked twice and defended 3 times.} 6. Nc3 O-O {Getting the king to a safer place.} 7. Bxf6 Bxf6 8. Nd5 {Attacking the bishop but not seeing the danger that awaits.} Nd4 {Attacking the queen. This is why they tell you not to bring out your queen early on in the game. The knight has a good outpost here.} 9. Qg3 {The queen tries to run but runs the wrong way.} Bh4 {The dark square bishop chases.} 10. Qe3 Bg5 {A blunder by black but the queen still has no where to run.} 11. Qg3 Bh4 12. Qe3 Nxc2+ {A royal fork. Black is actually forking three pieces. } 13. Ke2 Nxe3 14. Kxe3 Bg5+ 15. Ke2 Bg4+ 16.

Nb6 {White should look twice before crossing the street.} Qxb6 {Now the queen is lined up with the b pawn and can check the king.} 23. b3 {White notices this and creates a pawn chain.} Rad8 24. f4 Bxf4 25. f3 {The move that leads to distruction.} Qd4 {Poor move. Black is attacking the rook but needs to be attacking the king.} 26. Rhg1 Qe3+ {Now the correct move!} 27. Kd1 {If he had have played Kf1 here then his life would have been prolonged for a few more moves. Qd2#} Qd2# {I wonder why they say focus on the endgame instead of opening traps?}
