[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 {King pawn opening, very popular and solid.} c5 {The Sicilian defence, an opening I enjoy playing as black.} 2. c3 {Alapin's variation.  The pawn on c3 supports an eventual pawn on d4.} Nf6 {This move develops the knight with the tempo of attacking the e4 pawn.} 3. e5 {Attacks the knight and removes the pawn from danger.} Nd5 {Removes the knight from danger and moves to a central location.} 4. d4 {The pawn thrust that was supported by 2) c3.} cxd4 {Trading of central pawns to open up the c-file.} 5. cxd4 {Completely opens the c-file.  The battle for this file will come into play later on in the game.} e6 {I was still going off the database at this point.  The top two options for black were d6 and e6.  I prefered e6 because d6 seemed to temporarily lock in my black bishop.  I had plans of developing my white bishop to b7, so I didn't view e6 as locking in my white bishop.} 6. Nf3 {Standard developing move.} b5 {This was the point where the game left the database.  As I mentioned before, the plan is to develop the bishop to b7 and take control of the long diagonal.  The move b6 was also a possibility, but b5 was a nice little trap.  If white plays spontaneously 7) Bxb5, he loses the bishop to 7) ... Qa5 , forking the king and bishop.  The only way to defend both threats is 8) Nc3, after which black wins a piece with 8) ... Nxc3.  This trap is a good one to watch out for.  Besides setting a trap, b5 also takes up more space on the queenside after being eventually backed up by a pawn on a6.  This is an example of a good trap: one that improves your position while giving your opponent an opportunity to make a blunder.  The only potential downside to this move is that it weakens the c5 square, and this will come to show later in the game.} 7. a3 {Of course, my opponent was too good to fall for the trap.  Instead, he stops a possible bishop check at b4.} Bb7 {Developing the bishop.  The other option was to immediately play a6 (which is the intended pawn set-up) and to play Bb7 next move, but I figured it would be better to leave the trap still in the air, just in case.} 8. Bd3 {It's now clear that white is definitely not going to fall for the trap.  Instead, he clears the way to castle kingside.} a6 {If white castles, the trap no longer exists.  This move supports the b6 pawn and moves into the structure I had planned.} 9. O-O Nc6 {Develops the knight and puts pressure on d4.} 10. b4 {Solidifies the pawn structure and provides an excellent knight outpost at c5.  This move also limits the mobility of my black bishop, whose only developing move is on e7.  A good, solid move.} Qb6 {I was a bit torn between Qb6 and Nb6 at this point.  Qb6 has the immediate threat of winning the d4 pawn, but Nd6 is a much more strategical move.  Nd6 would prepare my knight to infiltrate at either c4 or a4 (probably c4), which would put it at a good outpost.  Nd4 would also start to clear up the long diagonal for my white bishop.  I ended up going with Qd6, which may have been a small mistake.} 11. Be3 {Defends the pawn on e4 while developing the bishop.} Rc8 {Putting my rook on the open c-file (putting a rook on an open file is almost always a good idea)} 12. Qd2 {Prepares the move Rc1 in order to challenge the c-file.} Nce7 {My knight as it sat on c6 was doing nothing but getting in the way of my bishop and my rook.  Since that knight had no squares to go to on the queenside, I decided to shuttle it over to the kingside by placing it on g6.} 13. Rc1 {Challenging the open file.} Rxc1+ {Normally it isn't a good idea to give up control of the open file.  In this case, though, I was concerned about the possibility of him playing Rxc8.  This would force my to take back with either my bishop or my knight, and that would put the bishop or knight in an inactive spot and waste time.  I decided instead to temporarily let his queen have the c-file, since I control all squares along that file from c4 to c8 with my pieces.} 14. Qxc1 Ng6 {Finishing the knight maneuver.  This move also allows the bishop to come to e7 so I can castle away and bring my other rook to the c-file.} 15. Nbd2 {At this point the weakness of c5 starts to become clear.  White's plan is to move the knight to b3 and then to c5, where it would be supported by two pawns.  I also wouldn't be able to take the knight on c5 without giving him a strong pawn on c5 that would become a protected passed pawn if my d-pawn ever left the board.} Be7 {There's nothing I can do about white moving the knight to b3, so I continue my plan to castle away and bring my rook into the game.} 16. Nb3 O-O 17. Qd2 {Once again, we have a battle for the c-file.  He now plans to play Rc1.} Nxe3 {This move may have been a bit forcing.  My main plan was to finally clear the long diagonal for my bishop.  Another idea was to win the two bishops (a very small win, but still something).  One final idea was hopes of white's kingside being weakened if 18) fxe3.  Although all these ideas are good, it may have been better to stick with the plan of Rc8.} 18. fxe3 {A questionable move.  I thought he would take back with the queen, since that would keep his kingside more intact.  This move also doubles his pawns on the e-file, although the pawns are still pretty strong.} Rc8 {Going back to the plan of controlling the c-file.} 19. Rc1 {Challenging the c-file.  Nc5 would have probably been a bit better, since white has a spacial advantage.  When you have more space than your opponent, it's usually a good idea to not trade down and try to cramp your opponent.  This move allows me to clear the board of rooks, which I did.} Rxc1+ 20. Qxc1 d6 {This move temporarily stops his knight from moving into c5.  More importantly, however, it opens up the game a bit.  This allows my bishops to be much more effective, particularly my black bishop.} 21. exd6 {Accepting the trade of pawns.  By getting rid of my d-pawn, he makes the c5 square an even better square for his knight.  Now if it ever goes there, I can't take it with my bishop without giving him a protected passed pawn.} Bxd6 {Improves the placement of my black bishop and eyes the h6 square.  Suddenly there's a sense of my pieces aiming toward a kingside attack.  Note that even though his queen controls the c-file, my pawn and two bishops control all squares along the c-file from c4 to c8, therefore not allowing his queen into my position.} 22. Nc5 {Moves the knight to the beloved c5 square white attacking the white bishop and the a-pawn.  White now has a solid structure on the queenside.  The only way I can try to undermine his position is with a pawn break at a5.} Bxf3 {I wasn't looking at trying to make a pawn break.  Instead, I got my bishop out of attack.  This move also had a bit of wishful thinking.  After the pawn recaptures the bishop, white's king will be open to attack.  The fact that I have only three pieces left afterward makes it a bit obscure, but his open king position proves to be a big weakness later in the game.  Also, this move changes the nature of the game a bit.  After the bishop is recaptured, we will have a bishops of opposite color scenario.  I have a black bishop while white has a white bishop.  If the bishops stay on the board and the queens and knights get traded off, the resulting endgame will almost definitely be a draw.  I won't go into too much detail on bishops of opposite color here, but it's useful to know that the endgame of bishops of opposite colors tends to be very, very drawish.} 23. gxf3 Qc7 {This move is twofold.  First and foremost, my queen and bishop align to attack h2.  Second, his strong knight on c5 is now pinned to his queen.} 24. f4 {Blocks the attack on h2, but potentially weakens the e3 pawn, which cannot move because of the queen-bishop battery attacking the pawn on f4.} Qb6 {Looking back, I seriously question this move.  There was no reason for it.  All I did was lose the positional advantages I gained from moving the queen to c7.  Fortuanately for me, I didn't lose the game because of this move, but I think I should have played Ne7 instead.  This would prepare the knight to move to d5 and attack the weak e3 pawn.} 25. Qf1 {White is preparing a kingside attack of his own, as well as temporarily making a pawn break at a5 impossible for me.} Ne7 {Preparing to move to d5, as mentioned before.  At this point white should stop this plan by playing 26) e4.  With my queen no longer on c7, I no longer have the option of taking the pawn on f4.} 26. Qh3 {Instead, white continues his attack.  The threat is simple: to take the pawn on h7.} h6 {A good defensive move, and much better than the alternative of g6.  If 26) ... g6, then white has the option of 27) Qh6, putting the queen on a powerful square near my king.} 27. Qh5 {To be honest, I'm not sure what the point of this move was.  It has a similar feel to my 24th move: a queen move that doesn't really do anything specific and lets the opponent continue on with their plans.} Nd5 {Finishing the knight maneuver and attacking the weak pawn on e3.} 28. Qh3 {Defending the pawn on e3.} a5 {A possible mistake on my part, as it allows him a tactical shot.  Immediately after I played this move I saw the possible move for him and started getting a bit nervous.  White's possibility was this: 29) Nxe6!.  If I play 29) ... fxe6, then he plays 30) Qxe6 , forking my king and my knight, ultimately winning two pawns with the combination.  A possible continuation I looked at was 30) ... Kf8 (Kh8 loses by force) 31) QxNd5 axb4 32) axb4 Bxb4 33) Qxb5 Qxb5 34) Bxb5.  I didn't look into many quirks in the position, but I relaxed a hair when I realized that it would become an endgame with bishops of opposite color, so I would stand a good chance at a draw.  In any case, the position after white's 28th move was a sort-of static one.  I knew that I wanted to undermine his powerful knight, and a5 was the only move I saw that had a chance at doing so.} 29. bxa5 {Fortunately for me, my opponent didn't see the tactical shot that I did.  This move was probably a bit of a mistake on white's part, as it does exactly what I wanted to do: lessen white's control of the c5 square.  The line that follows was calculated out by both of us and was the turning point of the game.  Unfortunately for him, he didn't see a small nuiance in the position that allowed me to grab an insurmountable advantage on move 31.  To be honest, I didn't see the move either until the position arrived.} Qxa5 {I was still worried about the white knight capturing on e6, but I had no real alternative.} 30. Nb7 {Forks the queen and bishop.  The entire line played by white puts white in a worse position, but this isn't made clear until move 31.} Qxa3 {The only move.  Now I have a potentially powerful passed pawn on b5.  Also, if white plays 31) NxBd6, I will play 31) ... QxBd3, getting rid of the bishops of opposite color and preparing to push my b-pawn while attacking his weak pawn on e3.} 31. Bxb5 {The only alternative for white is to get rid of my passed pawn and even the material.  Unfortunately for white, my next move proves decisive.} Bxf4 {! Taking the free pawn and preparing to take on e3.  White cannot take back because his pawn on e3 is pinned to his queen!  Now both of white's minor pieces are shuttled to the side of the board, allowing me to pick off his central pawns and move into a winning endgame.  Note that I could have taken the pawn with the knight to attack his queen, but the attack of the pawn on e3 by the bishop is much stronger.} 32. Bc4 {The only idea I see behind this move is to remove a piece attacking e3, but it's a little too late.} Bxe3+ {Continuing to win material.} 33. Kh1 {The only move.  If 33) Kg2, then 33) ... Nf4  wins the queen.  If 33) Kf1, then 33) ... Qc1  [or Qc3 ] 34) Kg2 [or Ke2] ... Kf4 , winning the queen.} Qa1+ {I was looking for some way to fork one of his minor pieces, but couldn't find one.  So I went with forking the final central pawn instead.} 34. Bf1 Qxd4 {While taking the pawn, this also has ideas of trapping the white's knight with Qb6.} 35. Nd8 {Possibly preparing one last shot of taking on e6 with the knight and then the queen.} Nf4 {Attacks the queen and defends e6.  There's a bit of irony in that my pieces are all exactly where all his central pawns used to be.} 36. Nxe6 {Taking a pawn with hopes of exchanging queens, but the position is basically lost by now anyway.  I could simply take back on e6 and win a piece.  However, when you find a good move, look for a better one.} Qe4+ {Qd5  works just as effectively.  If 37) Qf3 then 37) ... Qxf3  and black wins the queen.  If 37) Qg2 then 37) ... Nxg2 and black wins the queen.  That leaves one legal move left for white.} 37. Bg2 {Now my queen is under attack as well.  One final (and relatively simple) move wins the game.} Qb1+ {And white resigned.  After 38) Bf1 (the only legal move), I play the simple 38) ... Nxh3 and win the queen.  }
