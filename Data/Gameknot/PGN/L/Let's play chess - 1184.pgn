1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. e4 g6 4. d3 Nc6 5. g3 Bg7 6. Bg2 d6 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Qd2 Nxe3 9. Qxe3 {fxe3 would have been a better option here, providing coverage against Nd4.  Once lodged in there with the black bishop gone, that knight is a nuissance and a half.} Nd4 10. Qd2 h5 11. Nge2 Bh6 12. f4 Bg4 13. O-O-O c5 14. h3 Bxe2 15. Nxe2 b5 16. g4 {This would be an example of why we don't decimate the pawn infrastructure and pin our queen.  Trading knights and going down one pawn would have been the better option.  Followed immediately by Kb1 and then Qf2.  Much, much better.} exf4 17. Nxf4 {18.  Qf4  made this look safe, but ...Ne2 makes it not exactly safe.  Oops.} Bxf4 18. Rhe1 Bxd2+ 19. Rxd2 b4 20. e5 {}
