1. g3 {This makes slightly more sense than h3.  Not that I know how to exploit it, but this opening immediately tells me I'm playing someone who has studied some and is trying to fox me with unusual play.} e5 {No point playing d5 and giving White something to attack right away.} 2. e3 {This is very pretty, but leaves me unsure of the real point of the opening.} d5 {Sure, I'll play White with the Black pieces.} 3. b3 {Oh goody, double fiancetto.} e4 {I don't understand White's opening; what I do know is that this move messes with the normal flow of the game.  After 3. b3 I needed something to give me space to figure the position out.  Looking at it now, perhaps 3. ... Bb4 or 3. ... Nc6 was in order.  Apparently Nf6 is "standard".} 4. Ne2 {A minor victory for Black.  The immediate response 4. Nc3 causes all kinds of problems.  Issues.  Complications.} Nf6 5. Bb2 Be7 6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O Nc6 8. Nd4 Bg4 9. Qc1 Qd7 10. d3 Rfe8 11. Nd2 Bc5 12. Nb5 {Despite White's odd opening favoring his bishops, this is the first piece he's put across the board in the game.} d4 {Possibly a mistake by Black? 13. Nxe4 dxe3 14. fxe3 Nxe4 15. Bxe4 and Black is down a pawn.  15. ... a6 drives back the knight but the situation is unclear.} 13. exd4 Nxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxd4 15. Nc4 Bf3 16. dxe4 Bxe4 17. Rd1 Bxg2 18. Kxg2 Qc6+ 19. Kg1 Bxb2 20. Nxb2 Ne4 21. Re1 Qc5 22. Nd3 Qg5 23. Qe3 Qxe3 24. Rxe3 Nd2 25. Rae1 Rxe3 {Giving White the column is unconscionable; leaving the two Rooks in place is recipe for mate; White could always isolate the pawn with a boneheaded 26. fxe3.} 26. Rxe3 b6 27. Nb4 Kf8 28. Nd5 c5 {Trying to regain position against White's slightly advanced pawns.  White should try to drive off the Black knight.} 29. h4 Re8 30. Rxe8+ Kxe8 {Black's King is now centered with nothing but a knight to contest the middle; White's pawn structure leaves his King forced to the side of the board.} 31. Nc7+ Kd7 32. Nb5 a6 33. Nc3 Kc6 34. Kg2 b5 35. Kh3 f5 36. g4 fxg4+ 37. Kxg4 {The exchange has isolated White's King-side pawns, although his King is finally free.} Kd6 38. f3 Ke5 {Black moves to cut off White's King-play; White contests with the KBP.} 39. f4+ Kd4 40. Ne2+ Kd5 41. f5 Ke5 42. Nf4 Nf1 43. Nh5 Ne3+ 44. Kg5 Nxf5 45. c4 Ke4 46. cxb5 axb5 47. a4 bxa4 48. bxa4 c4 {Black has the tempo - barely - and White has no counterplay.} 49. a5 c3 50. a6 c2 51. a7 c1=Q+ 52. Kg4 Qg1+ 53. Kh3 Qh1+ {Game.}
