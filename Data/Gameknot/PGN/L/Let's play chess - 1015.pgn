[Opening "French (C02), advance, Paulsen attack"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 {Typical Structure of French Defence in Advance variation: White has a strong p chain in the center, & black consistently will attack the base d4 of the p-chain. White will try to reinforce the base.} Nc6 5. Nf3 cxd4 {Here we also see 5....,Qb6!?} 6. cxd4 Bb4+ {The check doesnt disturb white but anyway...} 7. Nc3 Nge7 {This N will either go to f5 or g6} 8. Bd3 {Clears the path for castling on the k-side} Qb6 {Brings pressure on d4-p} 9. O-O {Unfazed with the threat white plays as per the plan.} O-O {Better was 9...,Bd7!? reinforcing the threat on d4-p. Immediate 9...,Nxd4? due to 10.Nxd4,Qxd4; 11.Bb5  picks the Q on discovered attack.} 10. Bxh7+ {with black pieces all piled on q-side this sac work like a butter} Kxh7 {forced else he simply drops a p for no reason. But neverthless 10...,Kh8 was called for. Now after the text whites attack accelerates} 11. Ng5+ {check clears the path for whites Q to join the attack} Kg8 {What else? eg: if 11...,Kg6 stopping the Qh5 thrust is met with 12.Qd3 ,f5; 13.Qh3! swing for the final blow via h7 #} 12. Qh5 {Threatens 13.Qh7 #, so there is} Rd8 {Idea is if 13.Qh7 ,Kf8; 14.Qh8 ,Ne8 blocks the check when black K escapes via e7; but text weakens f7, so white strikes first there } 13. Qxf7+ {forcing} Kh8 {Now how should the attack move?} 14. Rd1 {Prepares for the swing on k-side via d3.} Bd7 {It seems black didnt consider whites last move else he should had played 14...,Qa6!? but then whites prepares the swing from e-file; 15.Re1,Qd3; 16Re3 - & black is forced to part with his Q in order to save the #} 15. Rd3 {black resigns as # is inevitable}
