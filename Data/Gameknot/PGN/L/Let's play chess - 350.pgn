[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 {standard kings pawn opening} e5 2. g3 {I love this opening it allows a quick castle and creates attacking and defensive power on the board} Qf6 {here comes the cavalry} 3. Bg2 {no pressure} Bc5 {lining up for a quick mate} 4. f3 {not today} d6 {Bishop on C5 is now out on a limb} 5. Ne2 {sticking with the game plan to get my knight and bishop out early} Bg4 {no need to take it but it needs re-enforced so rook over to f1} 6. Rf1 Be6 {knight sensibly backs away} 7. c3 {here comes my counter} Bb6 {bishop under threat from the pawn so withdrawn to b6} 8. a4 {I can have that bishop!} a5 {not anymore!!} 9. b3 {still working to get my counter attack in play} Qe7 {lack of options means the queen retreats to a strengthen the defence and leave it less vunerable} 10. d4 {right this is the start of my counter-attack} exd4 11. cxd4 f6 {I am now holding the centre, choices choices} 12. d5 {ok attack the bishop it has to retreat} Bf7 {bishop retreats to f7} 13. f4 {not sure if this was quite necessary in the grand scheme of the game but ok no harm done} h6 {again the black is waiting for my attack tries to create a better defensive formation } 14. Bb2 {B to b2 to open up a line of fire to h8} Nd7 {sensible move by black getting the knight into play} 15. Nd2 {2 can play that game} Bc5 {there that black bishop again still out on a limb} 16. Bd4 {time to resume the attack} Bb4 {should he have taken the bishop perhaps but it now prevents me moving my knight on d2} 17. Bc3 {well not for long} Bxc3 {quick exchange} 18. Nxc3 c6 19. Qe2 {anticipating the pawn taking d5 and then leaving e5 unable to counter take as the queen would have me in check, so move my white queen to e2} g6 20. O-O-O {now I have power down the middle on d e and f} Rc8 {anticipating a weak point in my defence with the knight on c3 and king on c1} 21. Nc4 {second knight moves into attacking role as the pawn on a5 is now unsupported } c5 22. Nb5 {building the knight attack this becomes clearer shortly} h5 {black is all bunged up so resorts to moving the pawn to h5 to try and create more manoeuvring space} 23. Na7 {knight attacks rook} Ra8 {rook defends} 24. Nb5 {bit of a wasted journey that} Nf8 {knight moves to f8 lots of congestion on blacks back row} 25. Ncxd6+ {what I should have done 2 moves ago} Kd8 {the black knight is a problem to the forthcoming attack so it needs to get dealt with kxbf7} 26. Nxf7+ {queen takes bishop f7} Qxf7 27. e5 {sneaky pawn advance} Rb8 {black decides not to defend pawn for pawn} 28. e6 {further advancement from the pawn} Qe8 {queen gets out of dodge} 29. Nd6 {knight then attacks, was that why he positioned his rook behind the pawn on b7?} Qe7 {unhappy queen moves to the only safe spot} 30. Nf7+ {nice check supported by the pawn} Kc8 {bye bye rook} 31. Nxh8 Qg7 {queen still not happy want to kill the knight} 32. d6 {tactically it helps me if the queen takes the knight at this point as I want the queen on row 8 not row 7} Qxh8 {the bait has been taken} 33. e7 {still charging ahead with the brave pawn } Nxe7 {knight has enough and kills the brave pawn} 34. Qxe7 {big lunge forward by the queen to e7} Qh7 {please trade?} 35. Qxf8+ {not today} Kd7 {queen kills the second rook } 36. Qxb8 {king moves to save the queen} Ke6 37. Rfe1+ {but there is no escape} Kf5 {king in a desperate hope flees but his own pawns are blocking an escape} 38. Qc8+ {a resignation, no point in losing both the queen and king, they are captured to fight another day  Well I do hope you enjoyed my annotation.  I tried to make it as humorous as possible.  I will also try to get better with my shorthand chess although I almost prefer the full narrative }
