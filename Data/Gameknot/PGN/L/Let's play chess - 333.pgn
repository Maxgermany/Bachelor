[Opening "QGD (D09), Albin counter-gambit, 5.g3"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 d4 {Classic move to create a passed pawn that suffocates the White center (See 2 games with biokovo, 1 which I won and 1 which I lost where this was very effective). } 4. Nf3 Nc6 {Defend the advanced pawn. Game will revolve around protecting and advancing the d pawn. } 5. g3 {This I think is a mistake. Better was e3. Forcing an exchange dxe3 and Bxe3. That would neutralize the tension in the center and black has little compensation for the pawn sacrifice. } Be6 {Attack the c pawn. Protecting it is not easy. Only the Queen or b pawn can protect it. Neither option is very good. } 6. Qb3 {This was not the best move. Among the 2 options b2-b3 was better. Queen gets squeezed in the corner limiting its ability to participate in the game. } Bb4+ {Basic idea is to prevent Qxb7. Do not want to move b67-b6 because the b pawn is defending the knight on c6. Another advantage is that it is attacking the king reducing Queen side pieces that can counter the pawn on d5. Yet another advantage is it helps the development on the King side. Goal is to castle quickly and the preference was to castle on the King side.  } 7. Bd2 {Recently in the candidates matches this move was often played to try and create an open file for the rook. So instead of BxB which would force black to defend the b pawn after the exchange, best to let the Q be blocked and hence a5.} a5 {I think this was one of the better moves in the game. If 8. BxB, respond with NxB shutting out the queen further and forcing the queen to defend the c2 square from the Knight. I was worried a bit with a2-a3 but then responding with a5 is strong forcing the Queen away to either d1 or d3. Then the N can safely retreat to c6 to defend the d pawn without any worries of protecting the b pawn from the Queen. } 8. Bg2 {White is preparing to castle on the King side.} Nge7 {Black preparing to castle on the King side. } 9. O-O O-O 10. Ng5 {Not a very good move in my opinion setting the Night up to be discover attacked by the Queen. However protecting the Bishop on e6 is important and it allows the Bishop to move to f5. An excellent square for the Bishop. Because it blocks off a large number of squares along the b1 to h7 diagonal. } Bf5 11. a3 {This is a bad move and one which I was hoping would be made. Standard a5 to a4 is great. Pawn has reached the 5th rank, and is pushing the queen off. } a4 {Awesome move. Used recently by Ivanchuk.} 12. Qa2 {Again a big mistake by White here. The queen is now out of the game. Better was Q to d1 or Q f3. } Bxd2 {b7 pawn no longer attacked. Safe to move the block out.} 13. Nxd2 Ng6 {This is a good move.  Attacking the pawn on e5 as well as a discovered attack on N on g5. Expecting f4 to defend both pieces. But then f4 would have double duty which could be exploited. However I missed a better move here which would be N to b4 which traps the Queen. I do not know why I missed that because I kept thinking that the white Queen has no square to go to since B is cutting off the b1 escape route. If I had not rushed I would have surely found it. I got excited about the discovered attack on the N on g5.  Clearly Nb4 was the best move here. } 14. Bxc6 {ok. this was expected. and I missed the N to b4 move. Ruins my pawn structure. So a slight loss but given that the queen side white is messed up anyway probably not too much of a loss. } bxc6 15. f4 {Aah. the expected move is made. The double duty on f4 to be exploited. } Nxe5 16. Nxh7 {Smart move to reclaim the pawn. } Bxh7 17. fxe5 Qg5 {Basically enough space for the Queen on the King side. Eyeing the e3 square for the Queen to check from. } 18. Nf3 {Not sure if this is good. Because the Queen was planning to attack through e3 anyway. Better perhaps was b3 giving the queen some space to move on the 2nd rank and defend the e2 pawn which is weak.} Qe3+ 19. Rf2 Be4 {Now the goal is to put pressure on white and advance the d pawn. To get the defending e2 pawn out of the way BxN would force that creating the passed pawn. Now victory is within sight. Very hard to stop the passed d pawn.  Or the 2nd option is d3. If exd3, the N night is lost since the rook is pinned. } 20. Rd1 {I could smell a win here. this is not enough to prevent d3. } d3 21. Rd2 {Nice move. } Rfd8 {Additional defense for the d pawn. This was probably a mistake. better was Ra to Rd8.  I debated on this and was not sure which is better and I thought perhaps it does not matter. } 22. Qa1 {too late.} Bxf3 {Clean up before the queen can get in to help. } 23. exf3 Qxe5 24. Qc1 Qd4 {Very hard now for white to have a second piece to attack the d pawn. So it is safe. Now somehow advance the passed pawn is the goal. } 25. Kg2 {Getting the rook out of the pin. } Rde8 {Basic idea. The e2 square is weak.  Setup so black can double up rooks on the e file. } 26. Rd1 {Possibly preparing for Queen to get into action? Perhaps better was Q to d1 adding a guard to e7. } Re3 {Preparing for doubling up while also protecting d3. } 27. Rfd2 {Possibly a bad move. The king is not very safe. } Rae8 28. h4 {Bad move. } Re3e2+ {Hoping for RxR, RxR and then d2 sqaure is available for the pawn advance. } 29. Rxe2 Rxe2+ 30. Kh3 {Now this is a blunder. White cannot escape now. I debated Q to f2.  but there is an escape square g4. SO goal was to first block that off. } Qd7+ {forcing g4 to g4. Now the king is trapped. } 31. g4 Qd4 {Basic plan is forcing Q to f2 which does not have a good defense. If R to f1 then d2, Qd1, Qf4 threatening either Qxf3 or Qxh2 for mate. But perhaps there is a better move in Q to d6 which threatens Qh2 mate.  But I knew that the game was won at this point for sure. } 32. Qg5 Qf2 {There is no escape. } 33. Qd8+ {Just delaying the inevitable. } Kh7 34. Qxd3+ g6 {good game.  }
