[Opening "QGD Slav defence, Alekhine variation (D10)"]

1. d4 {After learning 1. e4 opening, Now a day i am practicing queens Pawn opening with several variation. So 1. d4} d5 {He stuck directly in the center that is ok but little bit unusual for me because when i open with d4 the usual response of maximum player here is Nf6.  } 2. c4 {So i play queens Gambit.} c6 {gambit decline and a perfect response with c6. The other option may be defend d5 with Nf6. } 3. Nc3 {I continue developing and putting pressure on d5. } Nf6 {So the he continue developing and defending d5 with Nf6.} 4. Bg5 {whenever opportunity comes I am always happy to pin the knight (BTW it is still not pinned against black queen due to e7 pawn) rather than develop any of bishop on f4 or c4. } e6 {So he add another defender to d5 if in case his knight at f6 fall. Although, I never want an exchange of bishop with Knight at f6 or c6 unless it is forced or make opponent position week after exchange. } 5. e3 {With e3 i an now able to develop my lsb but i will be very cautious to loss of tempo in this variation. Particularly, after development of bishop at d3 black just take c4 pawn to force me to regain material equality but lose tempo.  } Nbd7 {He continues developing. This is another move i like to play if opportunity comes as connected knight are very good combo. } 6. Qc2 {Qc2!!!!. at the time of making this move my main purpose to confuse my opponent and guessing his intent of attack. See, not a single piece of king side out from the hut. They are still sleeping. } Qa5 {after black response of Qa5,  i realize Qc2 is an inaccuracy because black intent is clear to use pin of my knight at c3 and exploit my queen side. } 7. a3 {oops!!! another inaccuracy as suggest by post game computer analysis at chess.com. Analysis suggest a better line as  (7. Nf3 7... Bb4 8. Bxf6 8... Nxf6 9. Bd3 9... dxc4 10. Bxc4 10... Nd5 11. Bxd5 11... exd5) } Ne4 {of course wtih Ne4 black start to multi threaten me as i also do something to my dsb at d5.   } 8. Bf4 {SO i just move to a safer place. } Be7 {Analysis suggest this is first inaccuracy from black side. The better one he suggest is immediate g5.  } 9. Bd3 {So i am going to take this knight???} Ndf6 {Black combination is good here he keep active his most favorite position e4. } 10. f3 {Where my common sense goes and why not my favorite Ne2. Computer analysis rated this as a mistake. } Nxc3 {he takes} 11. bxc3 {i Take back} dxc4 {So he another loss of tempo as i am not too aware for this. He takes } 12. Bxc4 {i taken back} Nd5 {after some nice play with Knight by black i feel very irritated and take the knight without considering any damage.  So i take} 13. Bxd5 cxd5 {he taken back. } 14. Ne2 {Finally Ne2.} b6 15. O-O {i } Ba6 {This is another excellent move by black. Threaten to take my knight at e2 and weakening c3 paw. } 16. Rf2 {Instead of Re1 i made Rf2. Looking any chance of doubling the rook.} Rc8 {oops black decided to come out with all resources and now my queen feel uncomfortable} 17. e4 {So i counter attack in the center. I don't know why black waiting to exchange knight at e2, coz knight exchange at e2 give him a clear advantage } O-O {He prefer to secure his king before commencing a tough fight} 18. Bd2 {meanwhile, I found this better move, The idea was forcing the queen to retreat after c3-c4} Rc4 {But he guess my plan and so Rc4 to block pawn push also threatening me to double the rook.  } 19. exd5 {Again computer rate this as inaccuracy but i consider this as a pretty good exchange. } exd5 20. Qf5 {So queen in main battle field but for how much time } Bc8 {no no not for much time. I also activate his dull bishop at C4 but somehow i avoid the chance of doubling the rook . } 21. Qc2 {unable to find a good square so queen back to his position and play defender role only.  Dear reader please suggest a best square for queen here} Ra4 {so he now going to take material advantage .} 22. Nf4 {any way i am looking for some counter play opportunity} Rxa3 {he takes} 23. Rxa3 Bxa3 24. c4 {after this move i am more than happy to keep myself in the game see how} Bb4 25. Bxb4 Qxb4 26. Nxd5 {That knight is at right time at right place} Qe1+ 27. Rf1 Qe6 28. Qe4 {I thought queen exchange here and three central pawn is very good for me in endgame} Qd7 {he decline and now i am start capitalizing see how } 29. Qe5 Bb7 {No way i do not want to exchange this very active knight} 30. Ne7+ Kh8 {gain a tempo and make very good move Re1. why i first deny Re1 earlier and made Rf2} 31. Re1 a5 {His free pawn start rolling over} 32. c5 {but i never allowed this pawn to reach his destination, and play some beautiful move till end and force opponent to resign. } bxc5 33. Qxc5 Ra8 34. Nf5 Qd5 35. Qe7 {Till this move game is pretty balanced as suggested by chess.com computer analysis.} h6 36. Qe4 a4 37. Qg4 g6 38. Nxh6 Kg7 39. Re5 a3 {Chess computer analysis rate this game costing blunder. } 40. Nf5+ Kf8 41. Qh4 Qxe5 42. dxe5 gxf5 43. Qb4+ Kg7 44. Qxb7 Ra4 45. e6 a2 46. Qxf7+ Kh6 47. Qf6+ {Thanks for reading.
