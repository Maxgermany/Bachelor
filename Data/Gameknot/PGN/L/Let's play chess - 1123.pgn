1. c4 {The English Opening.  A personal favorite of mine that I enjoy because it is sound and avoids some of the tactical traps of more common openings.} e6 {A strange response, though not outside the realm of playability.} 2. Nc3 d5 3. e3 {Protecting c4 with the bishop and preparing a counter with ...d4} c5 {Preventing d4 from white and supporting a d4 push from black} 4. Nf3 d4 {Black takes the initiative on d4, gaining tempo after the exchange.} 5. exd4 cxd4 6. Nb5 {Ne4 loses even more tempo to ...f5, and Nc5 puts extra pressure on d4.} Bc5 {The only viable way to protect the pawn.} 7. b4 Bxb4 8. Nbxd4 {White is now winning with superior development and better opportunities for well-positioned bishops on b2 and d3} Nc6 {Challenging White's lead in development.} 9. Nc2 {Bb2 loses badly to ...e5 since black would be forced to retreat the knight, leaving d2 undefended for Bxd2 , preventing white from castling.} Nf6 {Preparing 0-0 and fighting for control of the still-contested center.} 10. Bd3 {Positioning the bishop and setting up 0-0} O-O 11. O-O b6 {? ... A wasted move that doesn't seem to accomplish anything except restricting his own dark-squared bishop after white plays a3.} 12. a3 Bc5 13. Qe2 {Setting up an attack down the center after Bb2 and Ra-e1} Re8 14. Bb2 Bb7 15. Rad1 {? ... puts the rook in a position that is no more useful than the one it moved from.} Qc7 {Setting up an attack on White's King side with the all four minor pieces and the Queen} 16. Be5 {Gaining tempo and blunting the attack through exchange} Nxe5 17. Nxe5 Bd6 18. Rfe1 Bxe5 19. Qxe5 Qc6 {Threatening mate on g2, with only passive defense possible for White.} 20. f3 Rad8 21. Be4 {Forcing another exchange, hoping for white to further blunt the attack.} Nxe4 22. Rxe4 f6 23. Qg3 Qc5+ {A good move by black, discovering the attack on the rook.} 24. d4 {Losing the pawn on c4, but regaining at least a little center control in exchange.} Qxc4 25. Ne3 Qb3 {Winning another pawn for Black} 26. Re1 {? Allowing not only the free pawn on a3, but also the rook on e4.  Black's best strategy seems to be 26...Bxe4 27. fxe4  Qxa3, but black follows another plan.} Qxa3 27. Nc4 Qd3 28. Nb2 Qb5 29. Re4xe6 {winning back one of the two pawns for White.} Rxe6 30. Rxe6 Qxb2 {White's defense of e1 is just enough to prevent the back rank mate, at least for now.} 31. Re7 {Threatening mate on g7} Qxd4+ 32. Kh1 {White appears to be in dire straits now, but keeps fighting on.} f5 {Protecting the critical g7 square with the queen} 33. h4 {White continues to scramble, hoping to storm the king at the expense of the last of his defenses} Rd7 {Down significantly in material, white should not even consider trading here} 34. Qg5 {Black cannot accept the trade because of 35. Qe8  } Qd6 35. Re8+ {A desperation check, White is simply hoping to buy time and hopefully allow Black to make a mistake} Kf7 36. Re3 g6 37. Qh6 Kf6 {?...Giving White a free tempo is the wrong play from Black} 38. Qg5+ Kg7 39. h5 a5 {?  Another tempo for White} 40. h6+ Kf8 41. Rc3 {White tries to use the open file to his advantage.} Rc7 {Black offers another trade.  Traditional thinking implies that when you are significantly ahead in material, you should try to trade off all of the pieces still on the board in order to maximize the advantage.  However, without proper analysis, trading material, even when you are ahead, can be disastrous.} 42. Rxc7 {White accepts, seeing a few moves down the road a disastrous turn of events for black.} Qxc7 43. Qf6+ {!!  The key move that the rook trade allowed for white, because...} Ke8 {???... A horrible mistake which will cost black the game.  Playing Kg8 prevents mate, although white then has continuous checks for a draw.  The rook trade, which was a sound move at first glance, has now cost Black the game.} 44. Qh8+ Ke7 45. Qxh7+ {Skewering the Queen} Kd8 46. Qxc7+ Kxc7 {and the pawn will queen, giving white a winning endgame} 47. h7 g5 48. h8=Q g4 49. Qh7+ Kb8 50. Qxf5 gxf3 51. gxf3 Ka7 {Black tries to hide behind the pawns, but to no avail} 52. Kh2 {allowing the pawn to move} Bxf3 {I can only imagine that Black is trying to get a stalemate by sacrificing all of his pieces} 53. Qxf3 a4 {Overexposing the a-pawn} 54. Qd3 {winning the a-pawn after 55. Qb5} Kb7 55. Qb5 {Black resigns.    Even though black was significantly ahead in both development and positioning entering the endgame, by using a timely trade, White was able to create a winning conclusion.  Remember, there are exceptions to every rule, especially in Chess.}
