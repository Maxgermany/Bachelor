1. e4 {Apa khabar? Another interesting game of mine. } e6 {1. e4 e6 Leads to French Defence. with normal continuation 2. d4 d5 which lead to early fight of center square and pursuation of flank attack between two wielder. Usually, the outcome of the game can be an interesting feature of a closed game. } 2. d3 {2. d3 ;) King Indian Attack against French Defence is nice. Among user of this repertoire including Fischer, Kasparov and many others in their early years. Some say nuisance of playing this move as it not directly motivating on controlling the centre but they need to know, white motive here is to strengthen e4 and to pursue pawns march toward kingside.   } d5 3. Nd2 Bb4 {3. ... Bb4?! Wow. My opponent is a Winawer Variation wielder. In normal french (Advance), winawer is a quite a weapon for black. But in this game I don't think it was appropriate as it lost tempo. It seem to be a dubious move.} 4. c3 {4. c3!} Bc5 {4. ... Bc5?! Another dubious move. My opponent try to trick into closing the center by force. I'm gladly doing that. } 5. d4 {5. d4!} Bb6 6. Qg4 {6. Qg4! Holding advancement of e-pawn for an attack.} Qf6 7. e5 Qg6 8. Qxg6 fxg6 {8. ... fxg6?! My opponent feeling good on 3 pawn island as result of immediate attack on f-file but I don't see an advantage either. } 9. f4 {9. f4! As on previous game (Annotated game http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/team-match-http-gameknot-com.pl?gm=20238)  I play tactically. But in this game, I try to demonstrate my positional understanding. 9. f4 is simply to gain the space advantage and in case black having to castling kingside, kingside pawns march is nice way of attack.} Ne7 10. g4 {10. g4 :) Avoiding the knight to march to appetizing f5 square. Meantime g4 put pressure on black kingside.} O-O 11. Ndf3 c5 12. Ne2 Nbc6 13. Be3 cxd4 14. Nexd4 Nxd4 15. cxd4 {SOP in French!} Bd7 16. Bd3 Ba5+ 17. Kf2 a6 18. h4 {18. h4. Here I saw white to play 18. ... Bb4, thus it take me time to play either a4 or h4. At the end, I feel that a4 is nuisance. I should concentrate on Kingside attack as the position persist.} Nc6 19. a3 {Hold the potential interruption.} Rf7 {19 . ... Rf7 Preparing for organizing attack via c-file or f-file.} 20. Kg3 Bb6 {6. ... Bb6 Giving way for Knight to b3 via a5.} 21. Rh2 {:D Preparing Attack} Ne7 {My opponent thinking twice on trying to attack via c-file and prefer to defence. but Ne7 seem to be dubious as black should try to attack.} 22. h5 {;) 22. h5!  If 22. ... gxh5 23 Rxh5 h6 24. Rh1   } Bb5 {Bb5!? Nice interruption and trying to confuse the position.} 23. hxg6 {23. hxg6! If now 23. ... Nxg6 24. Bxg6 hxg6 25. Ng5!  } hxg6 24. Bxb5 axb5 25. Ng5 {;) Rook already gone.} Kf8 26. Rh8+ Ng8 27. Nxf7 {Overlooked strong move 27. Bd2!} Kxf7 28. Rc1 {1-0 after here is SOP of ending play which is tremendously a winning for white.} Ke7 29. Rc3 Kd7 30. Rh7 Ke8 31. Rxg7 Ne7 32. Rh7 Kd7 33. Rb3 Ra5 34. Bd2 Ra4 35. Bb4 Bd8 36. Kf3 {36. Bxe7! Bxe7 37. Rxb5 Rxd4 38. Rb7  taking another piece. In which I accidently overlook. :(  Anyway, still black is already losing in this position. The rook was not active at a4, Knight cannot move due to pin, Bishop is defending the e5 square, King can only move to e8, pawns already scattered and not active. What can be worse? White is winning here.  36. Kf3 just buying time. :p } b6 37. Ke3 Ke8 38. Bxe7 Bxe7 39. Rxb5 Bd8 40. Rg7 Rc4 41. Rxg6 Ke7 42. Rg8 Rc1 43. Ke2 Rc2+ 44. Kd1 Rf2 45. f5 exf5 46. gxf5 Rxf5 47. Rxd5 Rf1+ {47. ...  Rf1 ??} 48. Ke2 Rc1 49. Rgxd8 Rc2+ 50. Kd3 {50. Ke3 Rxb2 51. Kc3 Rxx 52. R8d7  Kxx   }
