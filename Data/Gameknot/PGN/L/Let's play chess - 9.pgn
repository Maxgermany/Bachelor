1. e4 {I have only just started playing this opposed to my normal d4, but am really starting to enjoy the positions that arrise.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez} a6 {The most played move, making the bishop decide what it will do.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 {counter-attacking against the sometimes weak e4 pawn} 5. O-O b5 {Maintaining his ability to go into the Open lines with ...Nxe4} 6. Bb3 Bc5 {The classical lines} 7. c3 O-O {Not the best move, allowing white a strong iniative and the center} 8. d4 exd4 9. cxd4 {The classical two-pawn center} Bb6 10. e5 {driving the knight back} Ne8 11. Bg5 {continuing to develop with tempo} Ne7 {moving yet another knight into a passive position} 12. Nc3 {Some would try to force things, with something like d5.  But I don't think this is right in this position. I am now fully developed other than my rooks} h6 {A wasted tempo but what else is he to do?} 13. Qd3 {The bishop is poison.  See if you can find it. (it's pretty obvious)} hxg5 {yet he takes it anyways, now the game is over.} 14. Nxg5 {He can't play Ng6 because I just take it and mate on the move} g6 15. Qh3 {Mate can not be avoided.  Here he graciously resigned, as he sees he can't do anything.  Hope you liked this minature. }
