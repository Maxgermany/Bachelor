1. e4 e6 2. e5 {This is an unusual line.  Rather than developing, White makes an additional pawn move.} d6 3. exd6 Bxd6 {As a result of the exchange, Black has now equalized in development.} 4. d4 Nf6 5. h3 O-O {Black has now extended the lead in development.  White still has no pieces developed.} 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 b6 8. Nf3 Bb7 9. Bd3 Nbd7 10. O-O c5 {Because of the lead in development, Black is able to strive for the initiative first.} 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Nc3 Qc8 13. Qe2 Re8 14. Ne5 Be7 15. Nxd7 Nxd7 16. Bxe7 Rxe7 17. Be4 Nf6 18. Bxb7 Qxb7 {Black now probably has a slight disadvantage.  The attempt to seize the initiative has fizzled.  The pawn structure, if left unchanged, will favor White in an endgame.} 19. Rad1 Ree8 20. Rd3 Rad8 21. Rfd1 Rxd3 22. Qxd3 a6 23. Qg3 {White is imagining some kind of direct Kingside attack perhaps.  This is unlikely to succeed with so few pieces on the board.  Black also has ample time to prepare for it.} b5 24. Ne2 Rc8 {Black hits a hanging pawn, regaining the initiative.} 25. c3 Qe4 {Black hits another hanging piece.} 26. Nd4 Qd5 {Black attacks the a2 pawn.} 27. a3 e5 {This should win material, as White's N is pinned to the unprotected R on d1.} 28. Nf5 {White threatens Qxg7#, but Black can wait to deal with this because of the priority of check.} Qxd1+ {This move must be played first; otherwise the Q is lost.} 29. Kh2 {Only move.} Nh5 {Now Black protects g7--and attacks the White Q.} 30. Nxh6+ {White uses priority of check to grab a pawn.} Kf8 31. Qxe5 Nf6 {This seems boring, but bxa6 allows Qh8+.} 32. Nf5 Qd8 {Black consolidates the position, bringing the offside Q back.  g7 is still a target, but Black has an extra R for a couple of pawns.} 33. g4 Qc7 {Forcing the exchange of Qs.} 34. Qxc7 Rxc7 35. Kg3 Rd7 {Black's R threatens to penetrate.} 36. Nd4 Ne4+ 37. Kf3 Nd2+ 38. Ke3 Nc4+ {This check will win another pawn.  After Nxb2, Nc4 or Na4 will threaten another pawn.  White's N is on a central square, but not very active.  Black's N will fly around and eat pawns.  White resigned here.}
