1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 {As a Caro-Kann player, I do not like facing the Panov Attack, as Black often has to find some very accurate moves just to make it to the middlegame. However, if he can survive, the endgame should be better for him.} 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. cxd5 {An unusual move; Bg5 or Nf3 are usually played here.} Nxd5 7. Bb5 e6 {I think that 7...Nxc3 8.bxc3 Qd5, which led to a Black victory in Shamkovich-Adianto 1994, would have eased my defensive task significantly and made my next few moves easier. White would no longer have an isolated pawn, but the weakness would simply be transferred from d4 to c3.} 8. Nf3 {White now gains firm control of the e5 square, and this clamp makes it very difficult for Black to complete his development naturally.} Bd7 9. O-O Be7 {Given time, I would have liked to have played ...Qc7, which is often thematic in the Caro-Kann, to keep the White bishop off of f4, but I needed to get my king out of the center ASAP.} 10. Nxd5 {Now White's bishop can come to f4 whenever it wants to control the important h2-b8 diagonal.} exd5 11. Re1 {Hitting e5 again.} O-O 12. Bxc6 Bxc6 13. Qe2 Bf6 {In additional to clearing the e file for the rook to push the queen off, this move had another point - it was obvious that White was playing for Ne5. From this square, the bishop could snap off the knight if it became intolerable.} 14. Bf4 Re8 15. Qd2 Qb6 16. Ne5 {Taking the knight now would be a mistake because the bishop would bear down on g7, and my dark squared bishop is currently the only piece defending my kingside since the other bishop is shutting my queen out.} a5 17. a3 h6 18. b4 {I fully expected White to play 18.Bxh6 here, with two pawns and a raging attack on my king. This move gives me some play on the queenside and a little breathing room.} axb4 19. axb4 Qb5 20. Rxa8 {Although wanting my rook off of the e-file is understandable, there was no reason to hand me the a-file on a platter.} Rxa8 21. Qc3 Ra6 {A rook is not the most ideal piece to use as a defender. } 22. Ng4 Bd7 23. Nxf6+ {Ne5 might have kept the pressure on, but at this point, White has fewer targets in my kingside, and I can play for pressure against White's pawns with ...Ra5. I was happy to see this move, as the more pieces off the board, the better.} Rxf6 24. Bd2 Rc6 25. Qg3 Rg6 26. Qe5 {This move more or less forces the rooks off the board, but by this point, White cannot idly maneuver and hope for slow pressure - Black is starting to develop a few threats of his own, such as fishing for holes in the kingside with ...Bh3.} Re6 27. Qb8+ Kh7 28. Rxe6 Bxe6 29. Qc7 {Perhaps this is technically an endgame, but it takes on the character of a late middlegame because the opposite colored bishops each aiming at the enemy's king keep things sharp.} Qe2 {This move doesn't set up any specific threats other than the obvious one move attack on the bishop, but I felt that it could be useful to have my queen as close to the White king as possible in case I could set up threats later.} 30. Qc2+ g6 {Clearly, this was a risky policy, as my kingside is weaker than his. } 31. Qc1 h5 {I'm not sure about this move, which really weakens my dark squares - not what I want! I wanted to block in his bishop with 31...g5, but then 32.h4 looks strong. How else to defend the h pawn, though? Defending it with the Queen invites 32.Qc7. However, in such a case I could have simply brought my Queen back to e2, and followed this up with ...b5. This probably would have been the best choice for me.} 32. Bh6 b5 33. Bf8 g5 {The only move to avoid mate.} 34. h4 Qg4 {I'm going to lose a pawn, but material doesn't matter that much in an opposite colored bishop endgame.} 35. hxg5 h4 {I have a moment's respite, and all of my pieces are optimally placed, so there is no reason not to push this pawn forward and see what happens.} 36. Qe3 h3 37. g3 {White probably should have taken the draw with Qxh3.} Qd1+ 38. Kh2 Qf1 39. Qf3 Kg8 {Setting up a threat which my opponent misses. White had to try g4 here.} 40. Bc5 Bg4 {If Qh1, Qxf2  mates in two.}
