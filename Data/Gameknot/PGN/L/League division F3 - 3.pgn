1. g3 {A game to look at and see what went wrong.  Or can someone tell me how to get rid of a bishop at h3.  Probably the answer is to avoid allowing the bishop to get there in the first place.} e5 {I began with g3 ready to bring my LB to g7 and black went with e5.} 2. e4 Be7 {I moved my pawn to e4 and black developed his DB to e7.} 3. d3 Nf6 {Now I supported my e4 pawn with d3 and black developed his knight to d6 and he is ready to castle.  I on the other hand have not developed any pieces but I do have my DB and my queen on 2 open diagonals.} 4. Be2 O-O {Now I develop my LB to e2 and black castles.} 5. Nh3 d6 {I develop my knight to h3 which allows me to castle but I do not have any protection for my knight.  Black then pushes his pawn out to d6 so his LB is pointing at my knight on h3.} 6. O-O Bxh3 {I castled but probably should have redirected my h knight to g5 as black captured my h knight with the LB.} 7. Re1 Qd7 {I move my rook out of the LB's reach to e1 and black now moves his queen down to d7 supporting the LB at h3.} 8. Bf3 Ng4 {I develop my LB to f3 and black moves his f knight to g4.} 9. Re2 Qd8 {I move my rook to e2 to support my f2 pawn to avoid black's knight capturing it and then harassing my queen.  Black's queen moves back to d8.} 10. Rd2 Qd7 {I move my rook to d2 to allow the queen to move up better positioned to assist and get involved in the game. Black moves the queen back down to d7.} 11. Qe2 Nc6 {Now I move my queen up to e2 supporting my pawns and pieces around the queen.  Black develops his knight to f6.} 12. d4 f5 {I push my d3 pawn to d4 and black moves f pawn to f5.} 13. c3 fxe4 {I move my pawn to d3 supporting my d4 pawn and black captures my pawn at e4 and attacking my LB.} 14. Qxe4 Nf6 {I capture black's pawn at e4 with my queen and black moves his knight to f6 attacking my queen at e4.} 15. Qe3 Na5 {I move my queen down to e3 out of reach of the knight and black moves his c knight to a5.} 16. b3 Rae8 {I move pawn to b3 which allows the rook to protect more squares on the 3rd row.  Black moves his a8 rook to e8.} 17. Na3 d5 {I move my knight to a3 protected by DB at c1.  Black pushes d pawn to d5.} 18. b4 Nc6 {I push my b pawn to b4 kicking the knight at a5 which moves to c6.} 19. Nb5 exd4 {I move my knight to b5 and black captures my pawn at d4 and attacks my queen.} 20. Nxd4 Bxb4 {I capture the pawn with my knight and black captures my pawn at b4 with his DB.  The DB was at e7 with the rook at e8 and the rook is now attacking my queen at e3.  } 21. Bg2 Rxe3 {I now decide to exchange LB's so move my LB to g2 with black's LB at h3.  I do not want the queen to come down so would hope that black may take my LB but probably not likely.  I should instead have moved my queen and can't really say why I didn't.  And now the rook at e8 captures my queen at e3.} 22. Bb2 Ne4 {Needless to say I still have my LB and will not take black's as I don't want the queen coming down and attacking my king.  So I now develop my DB and allow my a1 rook to access the rest of the 1st row.  Black moves his f rook to d4 attacking my d2 rook.} 23. fxe3 Nxd2 {I take black's rook at e3 and black captures my rook at d2.} 24. Rc1 Bd6 {I move my rook along where I can protect a pawn at c3 and be protected by the DB at b2.} 25. Re1 Nc4 {My pieces are not easy to move into good positions.  The rook has the knight at e2 so i have to watch where I place the rook.  There is a rook at f8 so I don't want to place the rook at f1.  My DB is at b2 blocked by its own pawn at c3 and if it goes to a3 then black's DB is at d6.  I want my LB to stay at g2 because there is a pawn at d5 which I want to check the king with however there has never been a time when I can take it without black's knight being at f6 and the queen at d6.  My knight at d4 can go to f5 but the LB and queen are on that diagonal so its limited.  So I move my rook across to e1 and black knight goes up to c4 as there is nothing for him to capture from d2.  Now he can capture my DB at b2.} 26. Bc1 Nc6e5 {I now move my DB onto c1 and hope to find a better position for this piece.  Black moves his c6 knight to e4 attacking the f3 square and g4 square.} 27. Bf1 Qa4 {I now move my bishop down to f1 protected by my rook at e1.  Black moves his queen to a4.} 28. Bxc4 dxc4 {My pawns are all isolated and my pieces are not helping each other.  I now decide to move my LB to c4 to capture the knight at least there is only one knight now so they can't work together.  I think I see the LB at h3 as not doing anything useful so not worth capturing.  Black captures my LB at c4.  This is really funny because this is the pawn I was hoping to capture with my LB.} 29. e4 Nd3 {I push my pawn to e4 and black moves his knight to d3 attacking both my DB and rook.} 30. Ne6 Bxe6 {I decide to move my knight to e6 nearer to the king although I have nothing to support an attack as yet.  I forgot about the LB at h3 which now proceeds to capture my knight.} 31. Bd2 Nxe1 {In expectation of capture of one of the pieces at c1 and e1 by the knight I move my DB to d2 so as to recapture the knight.} 32. Bxe1 Bh3 {I capture the knight and black's LB annoyingly returns to his guarding duties!} 33. Bd2 Qd1+ {I move my only piece, the DB. to d2 to get on the diagonal and black's queen comes to d1 to check the king and with the rook at f8 I know that the game is up and its time to give in to black's unquestionable superiority.}
