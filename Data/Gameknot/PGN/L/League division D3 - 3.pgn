[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 {White starts with a standard e4, simple move but nicely effective.  He challenges the vital center squares, and opens up nice diagonals for his Queen and LSB.} c5 {The sicilian defense! the move ideally prevents white from 2. d4 (taking good control of the center) and gets the game started for the Queen.} 2. Nf3 {Nice development of White's g-knight! It gets the knight off the back rank and attacks the center at the same time, plus at a later stage it will allow for a very effective defense when the king is castled.} Nc6 {Black decides not to waste time and develops his knight, attacking the center. The d4 square is now attacked twice by black.} 3. Bb5 {Ahh, Ruy Lopez. Once black's d-pawn advances, the knight will be effectively pinned to the king, and therefore unable to attack or defend. Strong move! Trying to scare white's LSB away with 3. ... a6 will only cause 4. Ba4 ; the pin will still stand, and both players will have used up a move, while Black would also be left with a weak queenside.... } e5 {...Therefore Black decides to advance his e-pawn, as so far it is still protected by the knight.} 4. O-O {Ruy Lopez allows White to be highly aggressive, disputing the center, attacking on the queenside and protecting his king very early. Excellent opening really! the pawn structure in front of White's king, along with the presence of his rook and knight, makes for a very tight defense, as long as the pawns aren't moved.} Bd6 {Black gets his DSB off the back rank, developing a minor piece. It now protects both e and c-pawns, so it is a little overworked. The move is not too bad, although in hindsight, a better square for the DSB at this stage could have been e7 instead, choosing 4. ... d6 before. Now the d-pawn is stuck behind  the DSB, and the LSB is also therefore stuck! However, this way the knight isn't pinned yet, and is one of three attackers of the d4 square; not too shabby! } 5. c3 {This move sets up many things at once: White's Queen has now an additional diagonal to act in, LSB has the c2 square to run off to in case Black decides to chase it away from its position, and finally, 5. c3 supports the advance of White's d-pawn to the d4 square, which is defended thrice. } b6 {Black decides to move his b-pawn in order to give his LSB some breathing space, while also defending better the c-pawn} 6. Na3 {White develops his b-knight. In general, moving a knight to the side of the board means giving up half of its attacking power. In this case it defends the LSB and prepares to move to c4, a very nice square to be controlled by a knight.} Nf6 {Gets the knight out and prepares to castle.} 7. Re1 {The rook comes into play! it defends the e-pawn, which was attacked with the previous move.} Bb7 {Black gets his last minor piece off the back rank, in the only other safe square available to his LSB. this position is very cramped for him, so all he can do his park it behind the knight in order to eventually unleash a possible discovered attack.} 8. Nc4 {....And the knight comes into action! occupying this square, a lot of options are available to him. The one that catches White's eye is to attack Black's DSB, which is currently undefended. Black's gonna have to do something about that...} Qe7 {...And he does so by developing his queen! Bishop is now well defended enough, and actually Black has a choice of which side to castle to.} 9. d3 {White is a little bit behind with his development, having moved a couple of his pieces twice, so he decides to continue.  This pawn advance protects the e-pawn and allows his DSB, up till now doing nothing in the back rank, a long diagonal to get into play.} Bc7 {At this point, castling on the kingside would have probably been better for Black. It seems though he wanted to get that d-pawn into the game, while employing the DSB elsewhere. Both of Black's bishops, although off the back rank, aren't really being used to their maximum potential, while White's are much better placed!} 10. Bxc6 {White goes for an exchange, perhaps hoping Black will cripple himself with a doubled pawn on the C-file, and a semi open D-file.} Bxc6 {But black takes the offering with his LSB, which now has more breathing space than before. In hindisight, it seems like because of black's cramped position and misuse of his bishops as a result, white wanted to cripple him further by taking out 1-2 knights, the best piece when it comes to navigating similar positions.} 11. Bg5 {This strong move confirms that idea: black's remaining knight is now pinned to the queen, rendering it useless. black starts to feel the pressure, as white's more open position allows for more long-ranged attacks.} O-O {Castling is finally done, although it probably should have come a little earlier.} 12. h3 {And here is the move that will prove to be a bit of a problem for White. This pawn advance helps to protect against an enemy bishop or knight parking on the g4 square. Unfortunately none of the opponent's minor pieces are in a position to do so at the moment, they will be able to do so in 2 moves minimum. This is therefore a bit of a loss in tempo, a move which could have been used instead to get white's queen into position for example at b3 and allowing the rooks to get in touch with each other. Moreover, changing the pawn structure in front of a castled king, creates an immediate and irremediable weakness in the kingside's defense, one that black will take advantage of.} Rad8 {Puts his a-rook to work, protecting the advance of the d-pawn. Black plans to disturb the position in the center, aiming to at least dislodge the knight from its excellent c4 square, and perhaps to take hold of the d4 square.} 13. Bxf6 {And white goes for another exchange, taking both black knights off the board.} Qxf6 {The only answer. The good news is that black's position is now slightly less cramped than before.} 14. Qc2 {White queen makes space for the two rooks to talk. But why this square? surely taking b3 or even taking the diagonal passing from d2 would have been better?} Rfe8 {Second rook is moved into position. Black wants to get the d-pawn out into the center, disturbing the current position, probably cause an exchange or two, which will hopefully prove distracting enough to white. at the same time though, an attack is being setup on the kingside, which the LSB will lead, and the queen supported by one or two rooks will continue. essentially both rooks on this position are meant to distract but also to prepare for the real attack.} 15. Rad1 {So far black's plan seems to be working, as white is fully expecting an attack in the center, for which he is prepared with his second rook.} d5 {And here comes the attack! the pawn attacks two targets at the same time, one of them being a knight! it also is defended twice.} 16. Ncd2 {16. exd5 Bxd5 leaves black's LSB in a central, well defended position, which would put white at a disadvantage, so he decides to save his knight, hoping that black will 16. ... dxe4 giving him doubled pawns on e-file.} d4 {But black doesnt bite and advances one more square! the center is now much better controlled by black, and the important squares e3 and c3 are attacked!} 17. c4 {17. cxd4 would have given white doubled pawns on d-file. he was also perhaps in fear of a followup 17. ... Rxd4. he decided then to settle for this move, sealing the pawn structure as it is for the foreseeable future.} Rd6 {The second part of black's plan is set in motion. The rook is now ready to spring into action as soon as the queen gets out of the way; the two key squares of d7 and d8 are also freed up for the bishops' convenience.} 18. b3 {It seems like this move is meant to reinforce white's pawn structure. However, this has a huge drawback: white's queen is now relegated to a handful of squares, and will not be of any help at all in the coming attack.} Bd7 {Setup is complete. LSB is ready to spearhead the attack.} 19. Nf1 {White understands what's up, and rectifies by bringing a minor piece to the defense of its king, and freeing up some space for the queen. Unfortunately, because of the presence of black's pawn at d4, the queen is still somewhat limited in movement options.} Bxh3 {And the kamikaze attack starts! LSB sacrifices its life to breach the king's already weak defense!} 20. gxh3 {the only possible response, as allowing LSB to live would have only made the situation worse.} Qxf3 {Black eliminates the now undefended knight, while at the same time giving space to his d-rook to enter the fray! the followup is is 21. ... Rg6+ ...} 21. Ng3 {... which white predicts and blocks off with his knight, gaining a little bit of time to regroup!} Rg6 {Black moves the rook anyway, pinning the knight.} 22. Qe2 {Tries to scare black's queen away!} Qf4 {Luckily a pawn is there to save the day! black queen's position is slightly changed but the attack can continue.} 23. Kh2 {Protects the h-pawn, which has been until now undefended.} Rh6 {The Rook now pins the h-pawn to the king, and black threatens mate in 2.} 24. Reg1 {added defense to the knight.} Qh4 {Threatening mate in 1 unless 25.Kg2 Qxh3 26. Kf3 Qh5+} 25. Qg4 {In a last attempt, white tries to scare black's queen off, or at least to force an exchange...} Qxg4 {...But white's h-pawn is pinned, and therefore cannot defend the Queen, which is then taken as spoils of war!  at this point White gracefully resigns, giving the game to Black! }
