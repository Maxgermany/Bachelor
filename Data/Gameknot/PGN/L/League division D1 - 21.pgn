[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {This game is interesting if only for the queen sacrifice that forces checkmate.  Most comments are useful for non-experts and there are no comments about opening strategies.} Nf6 {Prevents white getting control of the centre of the board with e4} 2. a3 {This seems like a pointless move at this stage.  Neither important for defence nor does it develop any pieces} g6 {Enables development of bishop and black to castle quickly} 3. b4 {Still white has not developed any pieces and seems to be weakening his defence} Bg7 {Develops bishop and is now ready to castle} 4. Bb2 {This move protects white’s rook from the potential threat of black’s g7 bishop.  (It would only take black to force a move from the a4 pawn to leave a knight move uncovering an attack with possibility that the knight could simultaneously attack or take another piece.)} d5 {Allows the c8 bishop to develop and prevents the a4 pawn advancing which would have prevented black’s b8 knight from moving to c6.} 5. e3 {Defends the a4 pawn and allows white to develop f1 bishop} O-O {Usually a good idea to castle early without letting the opposition gain control of the centre of the board.} 6. g3 {Although this gives the bishop options it seems a slightly wasteful move – is it not better to develop the knights or at least pieces of value (i.e. the other bishop) – so far out of 6 moves 5 have been pawns!} a6 {This allows the night to move to c6 without getting attacked by the bishop} 7. h3 {Yet another pawn move without developing any pieces!  This is really weakening white’s defence without showing any signs of an attack} Bf5 {Bold if not pointless move!  Why didn’t black just develop the knight?  Black thinks if the white pawn attacks the bishop it doesn’t matter because he can then attack the white rook on h1} 8. g4 {As expected} Be4 {as planned} 9. f3 {Black had not planned for this as there’s no way of preventing loss of the bishop.  On the plus side, white’s defence and pawn formation is a shambles with the king wide open and nowhere to develop pieces! This is whites 9th move and the 8th pawn move!} Qd6 {Not worried about losing the bishop - this puts the queen within 1 move of forcing the white king to move without castling.  Also Nxe4 would be a big threat.  The only way black could prevent this with Ne2 but this would mean black could do Bxf3} 10. Qe2 {useful move because it enables fxe4 without leaving too much of a threat from Nxe4 after Qg3+} Qg3+ 11. Kd1 Nbd7 {white still wants 12 fxe4 followed by Nxe4 so develops the final knight which is better placed back up the knight on e4} 12. Nd2 {white makes a well judged choice not to take the bishop with the pawn for reasons previously explained and instead attacks the bishop with the knight. A better move was Nc3 because it means that after 12... Bxc2 13 Qxc2 is possible} Bxc2+ {black is best off taking the pawn forcing the white king to move and preventing both develoment of the g file knight if Bxf3} 13. Kxc2 {only move} Qd6 {queen moves back in order to enable an attack on the king} 14. Qd3 Nb6 {an attempt to move the knight to a4 - a threatening position} 15. Ne2 {finally moves the second knight in an attempt to help defend the king} Na4 {as planned} 16. Nb3 c6 17. Nc3 {this forces the black knight to either retreat or take a piece.} Nxb2 {black opts to take the bishop because it forces the king to move into a position that could potentially be attacked by the g7 bishop - a tactic that paid off - wait and see!} 18. Kxb2 b6 {this prevents the knight from moving to a5 and enables either the a or c pawn to advance} 19. Na4 Rfb8 {needed to protect the b6 pawn - black chose not to advance the b pawn because he wanted to move the a or c pawn forward} 20. Rc1 {this puts the rook in a powerful position and prevents the c pawn from advancing successfully, the pawn is defended by the black queen} a5 {as planned} 21. b5 {taking the pawn would have left the white king in trouble so the best move under the circumstances} c5 {Very good move - it may leave black a pawn down but remember the bishop on g6 and the position of the black king} 22. dxc5 {this is exactly what black wanted} bxc5 23. Nbxc5 {may have been better to use the rook to take the pawn and certainly would have been better to move the king to safety but white was worried about the c pawn advancing again and attacking the queen} Nxg4+ {white in serious trouble and about to lose a rook for nothing and probably wishes the f1 bishop had moved} 24. Ka2 Nf2 {the knight simultaneously attacks the queen and the rook and the queen is unable to protect the unprotected rook} 25. Qc2 {probably the best possible move under the circumstances - attacking the black knight (who isn't bothered)} Nxh1 {why wait?} 26. f4 {white needs to bring the bishop into the game but first decides to move a pawn... who knows why?} Ng3 {time to bring the knight back into the game and into safety} 27. Bg2 {bad move! the bishop was protecting the pawn on b5} Rxb5 {the b5 pawn is gone} 28. Qd1 {attacks the d5 pawn with bishop and queen which is only protected by the black queen} Rab8 {black hopes white takes the d5 pawn so that 29... Rb2+, 30 Nxb2, Rxb2+, 31 Ka1, Rd2+ wins black the white queen for a rook} 29. Nd3 {good move! white is wise to the threat of Rb2} Nf5 {attacks e3 pawn and hopes white moves e4 so that he can move the knight to d4} 30. e4 {hooray white did what black wanted} dxe4 31. Bxe4 Nd4 {as planned - enables Rb3 to be followed by Qxa3 checkmate.  Rb3 previously would enable white to swap queen for 2 rooks (2 rooks are worth more than a queen)} 32. Nac5 {Excellent defensive move.  Puts a stop to blacks plan... now how can black go back to the original plan of Rb2?} Qxf4 {This is not a blunder - black wants white to take the queen with the knight and it's game over!} 33. Nxf4 {Woohoo!} Rb5b2+ 34. Ka1 {only possible move} Nc2+ {whatever piece white chooses to take the knight with loses the game}
