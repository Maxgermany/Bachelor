1. d4 {This game shows the importance of queen at the end game against crowd of other pieces when opponents king is not protected well} e6 2. e4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 {this variation of french defence yields an open game on general. white conqueres center temporarily. on this variation white should attack.. and if he fails black might enter into the end game with a better position in the center.} Nfd7 {black is leaving his king side to his opponent. although seems passive Ng8 then f6 would be better.} 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. a3 {white is preparing to locate his bishop to b5. but first should prevent Qb4.} a6 {now white bishop's position should be at the square d3. but c5-c6 seems to yield position advantage to black. black should be thinking to which direction he should castle. a short castle might yield and unbearable attack of white, but black will conquer the queen side of the board. a long castling might be safer for black, but the initiative will still belong to white as the preparation of castling will take time. white on the other hand decides to initiate an early attack on blacks king side.} 8. Qg4 O-O {black accepts the challange. he is thinking that he has enough power to defence the king there.} 9. Bd3 c5 10. Nf3 {now whites development has been completed and the attack will start with Bxh7. but black has a surprise.} cxd4 {i was waiting 10...c4  and 11.Bxh7 would give an early win in that case. but my opponent saw this and will stop the attack taking both of my knights and my bishop against his queen. his automatic movements started after my 11th move.} 11. Bxh7+ Kxh7 12. Qh5+ Kg8 13. Ng5 Qxg5 14. Qxg5 dxc3 15. bxc3 {now the water gets calm. Whites attack seems to be stopped. his queens side pawns were detoriated. and the existence of 2 knights and a bishop against a queen gives black good chance for a win in the long term.} Nc6 16. f4 f6 17. exf6 Nxf6 {white has no obvious plan anymore. but the black has nothing as well. blacks queen side equipments the rook, bishop, and the poorly developed knight stand on the board aimlessly. white decides to continue to attack.. otherwise it is obvious that the black will take the initiative soon.} 18. h4 Ne4 {knight found herself a nice location. but 18...e5, 19.f5 (19.fxe5 Nxe5 20.Qxe5 Re8) Ne4 then Bxf5 would help black develop his bishop and take the initiative} 19. Qg6 Rf6 20. Qe8+ {having no sound attack plan, white is playing for draw and black rejects it} Rf8 21. Qg6 Rxf4 22. h5 Rf6 23. Qe8+ Kh7 {now the picture is clear. black has a material advantage after Nxc3, whites pawns are easy targets for the attacks, queen has not much movement capability. on the other hand, blacks underdevelopment on his queen side and his king being an easy target for the checks give white some chances.} 24. h6 gxh6 25. Rxh6+ {opposite to 11th move, this time sacriface was unexpected} Kxh6 {this rook sacrifice gives the total initiative to white. black has to lose time to develop his pieces.} 26. O-O-O Kg7 {good move to decrease the movement capability of whites queen.} 27. Rh1 Rh6 28. Rxh6 Kxh6 {there is one queen against 2 knights, bishop and a rook. but none of them is able to protect their king.} 29. Qf7 Na5 30. g4 Nc4 31. Qh5+ Kg7 32. g5 Bd7 {now black should have taken that pawn at g5, with his knight. then should move his king outside the queens checking range.} 33. Qh6+ Kg8 34. Qg6+ {34.g6? Nf6 35.g7 Nh7} Kf8 35. Qh7 {threating both with Qxd7 and Qh8 then Qxa8} Nb6 {protecting both rook and bishop} 36. g6 Ng5 {now blacks thinks that with giving the knight he could stop the attack. but as we will see in few moves, it was wrong. 36...Kf8 was the last escaping chance of black.} 37. Qh6+ Kg8 38. Qxg5 Kg7 39. Qh5 Rh8 {black was planning this move while giving his knight on 36th move, hoping to get the initiative.but there is a surprise waiting for him.} 40. Qe5+ Kg8 41. Qf6 Rh1+ 42. Kb2 Nc4+ {nice manevour to defend f7 square. Queen's support on c3 pawn is preventing blacks 42...Na4+ 43.Kb3 (Kb2 44...Nc3 45.Kb2 Rb1) Rb1 44.Ka2 Nc3} 43. Ka2 Nd6 44. Qd8+ Be8 45. Qxd6 Bxg6 {now white should decide on which of the two pawns of the black to take} 46. Qb8+ Kg7 47. Qxb7+ Kf6 48. c4 Rh2 49. cxd5 Rxc2+ 50. Kb3 exd5 51. Qxa6+ Kf7 52. a4 Be4 53. Qd6 Rc4 54. a5 Ke8 55. a6 Bc2+ 56. Kb2 Bd3 57. a7 Rc2+ 58. Ka3 {black resigned here}
