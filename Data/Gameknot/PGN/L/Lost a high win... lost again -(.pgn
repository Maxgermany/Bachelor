1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Bf5 3. Nd2 e6 4. Ngf3 Nd7 {Better than Nc6, in my opinion.} 5. h3 {The tricky loss of time.} c5 6. g4 Bg6 7. e3 {Black can block me in with c5, but I'll take care of it when they'll play it.} cxd4 8. exd4 Ngf6 9. Bb5 {I adventured this move, being sure black will go a6 or Qa5. But...} Ne4 {Wonderful! Let's see what can I get from this!} 10. Ne5 {Qh4 is not possibe or BxNd7+, of course.} Nxd2 {Even better! Now, a "noticeable" in-between move:} 11. Bxd7+ {Bam! No black Q in h4 anymore.} Ke7 12. Qxd2 Be4 {...and here, the "hurry blunder". I should have played 13. f3, and when Bxf3, 14. Rf1 (controlling the black's K escape square f6, threatening Qb4#). Instead, I hurried a bit too much.} 13. Qb4+ Kf6 {...and both my Q and Rh1 are threatened. } 14. g5+ Kf5 {Here, I thought that a tempo could have given me the upperhand.} 15. Qd2 Bxh1 {The obvious 16 Nxf7, QxB, NxR was not enough to save the game. Another try could have been 16. Qd3+, Be4 (if KxB, 17. Qg3+, and mate the next one), then 17. Qg3, and black has only h5 to avoid Qg4#. But then, 18. Be3, and I can see no escape to 19. Qf4#. Am I right? But I blundered again. } 16. Bg3 {?? Losing the advantage and the game. I didn't see...} Qxg5 {Now, there are no more tricks, I have no mate at all. I saved the day with...} 17. Qxg5+ Kxg5 18. Nxf7+ Kf6 19. Nxh8 {I assume my N is lost, but the material is still even.} Bf3 20. Be5+ Ke7 21. Bb5 {...aiiming to d3.} Rc8 22. c3 a6 23. Bd3 g6 {...and here, I blundered again. My N is protected by the B, and black needs some moves to grab it (a lot of them, actually: Bh6, Kf8, Bg7, exchange B and take the N. I could have tried something in the meanwhile (maybe a4, in order to activate the R on the b column). Instead,  I thought that I could get two pawns for a minor piece, staying with the edge. I failed to see the "residual advantage" black would get. } 24. Nxg6+ hxg6 25. Bxg6 Bh6 {...and my K is miserably closed in! } 26. h4 {?? Not the right manouver to stop his R to penetrate! Kf1 was necessary, and Bg3 would have held with advantage.} Rg8 {So simple... now, h5 (my first though) fails due to Bxh5, and if BxB, Rg1+ skewers my Ra1. } 27. Bd3 Rg1+ 28. Bf1 {Still thinkins I can hold: If Bg2, Ke2 and I can move. } Kf7 {...but now, I can't move any piece, at all!} 29. Bg3 {Again, not the right manouver... if any. I thought that at least I'll keep his R "trapped", but the trapped one, actually, is me. } Kg6 30. a4 Kf5 31. b4 Ke4 32. Ra2 {Desperation. I thought that the check will help, but it doesn't. } Bg2 33. Re2+ Kf3 {Nothing to do. Thanks for reading and... not laughing at me. I lost the chance to play a high win. Still, I think I managed pretty well the opening. Maybe.} 34. Bh2 Rxf1# {}
