1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bd6 {Yeah... That's strange that right there} 3. Bc4 h6 4. Nc3 a6 5. a4 f6 {I don't really understand Black's thinking with any of the moves after e5 to be honest. he's just happy doing his own thing so I just contented myself with doing mine.} 6. d4 c6 {Black has been a bit too care free just pushing his pawns to observe the tactics of the position I think it's fair to say} 7. dxe5 Bxe5 8. Nxe5 fxe5 9. Qh5+ {Note that a similar position could also have been reached by 7. dxe5, fxe5, Nxe5, Bxe5, Qh5+ in which White's queen picks up the bishop on e5, ruins the king position remaining a clear pawn up.} Ke7 10. Bg5+ {There is nothing 'wrong' with Qxe5+ and will probably also lead to a won position but I felt as if I'd like to bag more than a pawn even if some of the pressure on Black's position is alleviated in this line} hxg5 11. Qxh8 Nf6 12. Qxg7+ Kd6 13. O-O-O+ Kc7 {Although Black has avoided any mating threats it doesn't take a master to tell you that this isn't the greatest of positions} 14. g3 {With the idea of creating an outside passed pawn that Black's undeveloped pieces will struggle to slow} g4 15. h4 b5 {gxh3 was to be prefered. From this point on all White need do is push the h pawn to victory} 16. Be6 b4 17. Ne2 {With Nxe4 losing a piece to Qxe5+} a5 18. h5 Kb6 19. Bxg4 Nxe4 20. Qxe5 d5 {Sadly no variations can punish the pin of the d pawn to the Queen as Bxc8 breaks the pin after Qxc8 and Qxe4, dxe4, Rxd8, Bxg4 wins no more material. That said, White doesn't need to win any more material to claim the game} 21. Bxc8 Qxc8 22. h6 Nxf2 {Blundering Black's only outposted / developed minor piece} 23. Qe3+ Kb7 24. Qxf2 Nd7 25. h7 Qh8 26. Qf7 Rd8 {And now none of Black's pieces can move for a while} 27. Nf4 Kc8 28. Ng6 Nf6 29. Nxh8 Rxh8 30. Qxf6 {At this point Black understandably decides to call an end to the match}
