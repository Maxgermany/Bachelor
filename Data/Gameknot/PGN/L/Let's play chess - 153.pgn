1. c4 {Please feel free to comment on this game, I would like to see other points of view especially as this game was not won on a straight forward material advantage due to a blunder or sharp winning tactic and my comments may be way off base throughout.  English opening} c6 {heading for the slav or semi slav openings to avoid the English} 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 d5 4. e3 dxc4 5. Bxc4 b5 {transposition into a semi slav type position} 6. Be2 {this seems passive to me} Bb7 7. O-O e6 8. Bd3 Be7 {Moving the bishop again, (3 times in White's first 8 moves), due to it's passive placement, and into a position where it is directly attacked by black's queen, however, I completely missed the free bishop in this position.} 9. Bb1 {By this move white allows his Queen to connect with his lsb and eye a potential mate on h7 at a later time, but he also blocks his rooks development and leads to black developing with ease. This move leads to much of white's woes throughout the game however, I do not believe it was capitalized on as well as it should have been by black.} Nbd7 10. Qc2 {at this point the game looks to favor black who has more space and his pieces are mobilized whereas white has his two bishops locked in on the back rank. } a6 {this move frees black to advance his c pawn without losing the pawn, but may be a bit slow.} 11. a3 c5 {taking more space, freeing his bishop, and denying d4 to the white knight.} 12. d4 {normally a sensible move but this will lead to a weakened white king and an isolani} Bxf3 {exchanging the bishop for the knight to weaken the white king and double white's pawns.} 13. gxf3 Qc7 {favoring the development of the queen over creating an isolated queen pawn for white, in retrospect I think I should have taken the pawn} 14. dxc5 Qxc5 {this was probably not the most accurate move in this position but was played in order to give black's queen more scope.} 15. Ne4 Qxc2 16. Bxc2 Rc8 17. Nxf6+ Bxf6 {BxN exerts pressure along the long diagonal and pins white's DSB momentarily, while black's rook still threatens white's LSB} 18. Bd1 {Be4 would have been met by Nc5 threatening to exchange white's bishop and defending b7.} Ne5 {harassing white's weakened double pawn and threatening to invade with the knight.} 19. Be2 {defending d3} Rc2 {white's pieces get chased around as black's rook invades the second rank} 20. Re1 Nc4 {21.Bd1 loses a pawn to, ....Bxb2 22 BxR, BxR and white has lost a pawn.} 21. Bxc4 {Bd3 loses a pawn to Bxb2, BxR BxR} bxc4 {an odd looking recapture & position but black believes his superior pieces coupled with White's lack of development, which stems from the bishop retreat on move 9, will carry the day. White's king cannot get to d1 fast enough to pose a threat.} 22. Rb1 {protecting the pawn} Ke7 {centralizing the king seems more sensible than castling as it will bring Black's kind closer to the queen side for the endgame.} 23. b4 Rb8 {pinning the pawn} 24. e4 Bd4 {avoiding the bishop becoming passive after e5.} 25. Be3 e5 {the bishop is practically untouchable due to the connected passed pawns.} 26. a4 c3 {moving the pawn closer to queening, and leaving white with few if any viable options.} 27. Rb3 Rb2 28. Ra3 Rb8xb4 {losing the pawn and doubling black's rooks, the position is bleak.} 29. Rea1 c2 30. Kg2 Rb2b1 {white resigns, the white rook is being attacked by the black bishop, he cannot take the rook on b1 and taking the black bishop will not deny blacks pawn from queening.}
