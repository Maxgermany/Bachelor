1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 {huh are you serious?} Nc6 {best option to defend this opening trap is to go on with normal moves and ignore his attack} 3. Bc4 g6 4. Qf3 Nf6 {Looks solid but black has to watch out for his black squares} 5. Nh3 Nd4 {Queen move number 300 out of 6 moves.. nice :P} 6. Qd3 d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. Bxd5 {buh bye strong bisschop} Qxd5 9. f3 Bf5 {well playd by black} 10. c4 Nc2+ {hmm now black is waisting material. White can take the black queen on d5. To do so he has to take the knight on c2 with his queen, and pick up the queen after.} 11. Ke2 {Sorry to say it but, black gaved away his winning position. One move later white blunders the queen.   } Bxd3+ 12. Kf2 Qd4+ 13. Kg3 Be7 14. Nc3 Bh4# {:) I do like the way black took advantage of white using an opening trap. Black playd aggresive and earned the win :)}
