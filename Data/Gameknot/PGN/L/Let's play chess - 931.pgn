1. Nc3 {Never seen this before in my life. A weak opening, in my opinion,} d5 2. d4 c5 {I play a sort of Reversed Queen's Gambit} 3. dxc5 e5 4. Nxd5 Be6 5. Ne3 Qxd1+ 6. Nxd1 Bxc5 7. Nc3 Bb6 8. Bd2 Nf6 9. O-O-O Ng4 {A bold sortie by me! There is no possible defence for my opponent!} 10. Ne4 {He does his best though...} Bd5 {His best isn't good enough!} 11. Nd6+ Kf8 12. Re1 Nxf2 13. Nh3 Nxh1 {Now the game looks easy...} 14. e3 Bc5 15. Nf5 Be6 16. Ng3 Bxh3 17. Nxh1 {The knight was trapped anyway. And I am still ahead} Be6 18. b4 Bb6 19. Bc3 Nd7 20. Ng3 Bxa2 21. Bb5 Rd8 22.
