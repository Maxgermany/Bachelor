[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian defense is really my weak defense so i decided to try it for once. Usualy i would use the French, Pirc, Modern or Caro-Kann defense.} 2. Bc4 e6 {Blocking off the Bishop attack to the weak f7 square.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. d3 {I Should've thrusted my d pawn to d5 but my instincts otld me not to} d6 5. Bb5 {My knight is being pin ned down and i may lose my vauluable knight} Bd7 {Only way toavoid doubled pawns} 6. Nc3 a6 {Trying to fend off this bishop} 7. Ba4 h6 {Just preventing the future move of ng5} 8. Be3 Be7 9. h4 b5 {Finally The bishop harrassed me too much i rage} 10. Bb3 Rb8 11. a3 {At the moment it looks like he is going to castle on the queenside. Also creates a outpost for the bishop if i ever try to trap it} Nf6 {Getting ready to castle} 12. Qd2 {Ok now i really think he's going to castle on the queenside} e5 {Nothing to do. Waiting for him to castle. IF i was to castle He would castle on the oppposite side and he already has a strong attack on my kingside. He could sack ( Or howeer you spell it) his bishop on h6 and then he could push his pawns forwrds with the 2 rooks at the back providing support.} 13. Nd5 {Weakness of pushing pawns} Nxd5 14. Bxd5 Rb6 15. O-O Rb8 {I moved back because i saw his bishop on E3. I thought i would lose a rook if he tried to counter} 16. c4 {I spot the free pawn and go for it} Bxh4 17. g3 {Why doesn't he exchange  the knight for bishop} Bf6 18.
