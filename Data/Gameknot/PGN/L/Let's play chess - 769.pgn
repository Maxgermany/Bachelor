1. d4 c5 2. e3 e6 3. c4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Be7 {personally i dont like the last move for black but is playable.} 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Bd3 b6 7. O-O Bb7 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e4 {so far its been an equal game more or less. maybe slight advantage for white. when i analysed this position after this game i was certain that blacks next move is not that good. My iron friend confirmed it.} d5 {9....d6 was better.Now white has an advantage. this inaccurasy gives white an edge but still hes a long way from winning.After 9...d6 i would have played probably 10.Re1 or 10.a3.} 10. cxd5 exd5 11. e5 Ne4 12. Qc2 {White with the initiative here. Now i threaten to take a pawn.Will black try to keep it or play for development and counterattack?} f5 {this looks like a good choice and during the game i thought it was best too.however in the analysis later fritz suggested 12...Nc6. heading towards development and not material.Looking closely at the conclusion of the game i agree because whites initiative is getting bigger.} 13. exf6 e.p. Nxf6 14. Ng5 {Going for the attack.Now white creates various threats on blacks position.Ne6 for example or Bxh7+ winning a pawn.Black must react but in what way?} Ng4 {Black is trying to defend actively here and counterattack. The problem here though is he hasn't got time for it!!Fritz suggests again 14....Nc6, giving up a pawn for development.Sometimes you got to give something to avoid losing a lot!!} 15. Bxh7+ Kh8 16. Bg8 {The key move. Now white threatens checkmate!There's only one defence here for black!!} g6 {Unfortunately for him thats not it!16...Nf6 is best even though white has a big advantage in this position as well. for example 16...Nf6 17.Nf7+ Rxf7 18.Bxf7 with more material as i had seen during the game. And the variation that fritz gave in the analysis 17.Be6 d4 18.Qd3 Qe8 19.Nd5 Bxd5 20.Bxd5 Nbd7 21.Bxa8 Qxa8.} 17. Qxg6 Qc7 {Black was counting on this response, defending and also threatening checkmate on h2. at first glance looks good. However........} 18. Bf4 {If black makes another mistake here its over!If 18...Qxf4 19.Qh7#. The only chance is 18.Qg7 19.Qxg7 Kxg7 20.Bxd5 winning another pawn (20...Rxf4 21.Ne6+).Black is still in trouble but not mated!And if he takes on f4 with the rook then....} Rxf4 19. Bf7 {Its all over.White threatens mate in h7 and the only response is black to give his queen and rook for the knight. for example 19..RXf7 20.Nxf7+ Qxf7 21.Qxf7. If he tries 19...Nf6 then 20. Qh6+ Nh7 21.Qxh7#.Here black resigned.   So if we see the game here black made three errors that cost him the game real quickly. First of all a slight error of playing 9.d5 instead of d6, then another inaccuracy of 12...f5 instead of Nc6 and finally the most important error 14...Ng4 instead of Nc6. One error led to another and finally blacks position collapsed. He could have put up more of  resistance later but in the end it was that small mistakes in the opening that led the position to get worse and worse until it was too late. In blacks defence i think that 16...g6 and 17.Qc7 were very  nice defencive ideas but they simply didn't work.}
