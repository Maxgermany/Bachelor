1. d4 e5 2. dxe5 Nc6 3. Nf3 {White develops a piece and defends the extra pawn. 3. f4 allows black a lead in development after 3..f6! 4 exf6 Nxf6 5 Nc3 d5 6 e3 Bb4 paving the way for black to castle kingside  and having reasonable chances.} Qe7 {The start of the rather disreputable Englund Gambit.} 4. Qd5 {Better was to keep developing with Nc3} Qb4+ 5. Bd2 {Bd2? Again Nc3 is better or Nbd2} Qxb2 {White is in trouble,Bc3 looks the best reply} 6. Bc3 Bb4 {Bb4! pinning White's black squared bishop. Black is winning after 6 moves.} 7. Qc4 {Qc4?? presumably hoping for the exchange. Not noticing.....} Qc1# {}
