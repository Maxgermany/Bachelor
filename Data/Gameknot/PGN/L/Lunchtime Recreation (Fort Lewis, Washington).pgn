1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {We both enjoyed a good over the board battle, so fighting varations were the norm for our games.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 h6 8. Bh4 Be7 9. f5 exf5 10. exf5 {Although I have an isolated pawn, I still liked this position. (We were here many times.)} Qa5 11. Bd3 Nd5 12. Bxe7 Nxc3 13. bxc3 Qxc3+ 14. Kf1 Kxe7 {All that for a pawn!!  However, a pawn is a pawn.} 15. Qe2+ Kf6 16. Re1 {Threatens Qe7 mate.} Qc7 17. g4 Nc6 18. Nxc6 bxc6 {Not Qxc6 allowing Qe7 mate.} 19. Rg1 Bb7 20. g5+ hxg5 21. Be4 {A questionable continuation as it allows me to activate my pieces while temporarily pinning the Bishop.} Rae8 22. c4 d5 23. Qb2+ {Breaking the pin very nicely!!} Ke7 24. Bg2+ {I'm not sure, but I think I might have grabbed the d5 pawn in the process.} Kd7 25. Rxe8 Rxe8 26. cxd5 Qf4+ {Surprise!!  Charles thought the Queen was tied to protecting the b7 Bishop and wouldn't move because of Qxb7 ch.  Don't you just hate those unexpected checks?  ( I mean the kind you can't cash!!)} 27. Qf2 {No other good option is available.  Actually, that would have been a good time to resign and move on to the next game.} Qc1+ {And White resigned.}
