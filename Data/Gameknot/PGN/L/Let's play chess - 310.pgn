1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Is this the center game?} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 {?! I know this is a mistake, it brings white's queen out and it can't be easily attacked.} 5. Qxd4 Nf6 {?! Probably not great since he can just chase it with his pawn.} 6. Bd3 {Not the best square to develop the bishop too, it's blocked in by the pawn.} Be7 7. O-O d6 8. Bb5+ {?! this just lets me chase the bishop with tempo.} c6 {So I do} 9. Bc4 Bg4 10. f3 {Would the h pawn have been better? This lines up the king and queen for a possible pin, but if I retreat my bishop to h5 it doesn't have much scope.} Be6 {Will he exchange?} 11. Bxe6 {yup.} fxe6 12. e5 dxe5 13. Qxe5 O-O {?! hangs a pawn. At least my my rook has a half open file.} 14. Qxe6+ Rf7 {probably Kg8-h8 was better, this pins the rook.} 15. Nc3 {Finally he's catching up on development.} Bc5+ {Trying to get my bishop more active. Although it might not by so good because he can develop his bishop while blocking it.} 16. Be3 {And he does} Bxe3+ {So I trade.} 17. Qxe3 Nd5 {Moving my knight to the center of the board and if he decides to trade then I can centralize my queen.} 18. Qd4 Nxc3 {So I initiate it.} 19. Qxc3 Rc8 {I probably should have developed my queen.} 20. Qb3 Qd4+ 21. Kh1 Rd8 22. Rfd1 Qf6 23. Rd2 {?? Loses a rook for no reason.} Rxd2 {So I take it.} 24. Re1 Qe5 {He could just move his rook, but if he takes my queen my rook will deliver back rank mate.} 25. h3 {?? loses his other rook.} Qxe1+ {And he resigns. Please comment.}
