1. e4 {Hello everyone, you are about to see a nice chess game I played.} c5 2. Bc4 d6 3. Nf3 {This is simply opening with Sicilian defence.} Bd7 4. Nc3 e6 5. O-O a6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Be7 8. Re1 Nc6 9. Be3 b5 {It seems that the Bishop in the square c4 is somewhat trouble for the opposite side. I can move back the Bishop but I thought first better exchange the Knights at d4 and c6 and then think about the Bishop or getting back the Knight if he still wants to take the Bishop.} 10. Nxc6 Bxc6 11. Bd3 {See, a pair of Knights are gone.} Rc8 12. a3 Nf6 13. b4 O-O 14. f4 Qc7 15. Bd2 e5 16. h3 {Both sides are trying to attack the other side. Who will succeed? You may better watch..,} Ne8 17. Ne2 h6 18. Ng3 Bd7 19. Rc1 f5 20. exf5 {Now pawn to pawn attack. Just an exchange though white pawn advancing and white side got a plus.} Nf6 21. c3 Bc6 22. Ne4 d5 23. Nxf6+ Bxf6 {Battle is going and Knights fought bravely so now it is hard to find any.} 24. fxe5 {Now pawns start to crawl and...} Bxe5 25. Be3 Bh2+ {After the pawns, Bishops thought that would be their time to move... } 26. Kh1 Bg3 27. Rf1 d4 28. Bxd4 {Further I plucked another pawn and also attacking his pawn at g7.} Qb7 {See some attack that to my pawn at g2,  making by moving the Queen.} 29. Qb3+ {Now, I think better move the Queen and attack the King. White side has better choices of moving their Bishop or the King. I thought he would move the King. Then I would advance the pawn at f5 and get another exchange/s and I would lessen his defenses.} Bd5 {See, Bishop... I have to start my other plans. The first thing is nothing but the movement of the Queen remember that my pawn at g2 is in danger.} 30. Qc2 Rc7 31. f6 {Now it would be time for some harvest.} gxf6 32. Rxf6 Rcf7 {Here I could get rid of the Rook but better give some company to the Rook at f6.} 33. Rcf1 Rf7xf6 34. Rxf6 Rxf6 35. Bxf6 {So, got exchanges of the Rooks, leaving the battle for the Queens and Bishops.} Bd6 36. c4 bxc4 37. Bxc4 Bf7 {Now I earned an attacking position. So, then why not go with the Queen. But how? } 38. Qg6+ Kf8 39. Qxh6+ Ke8 40. Qh8+ {It is time to earn a Bishop. You see how...} Kd7 41. Bxf7 Qb5 {What a move... I think he gave up and he just made a move. Do you see why it is a very bad move?} 42. Be8+ {You got it. It is the end of the Queen as well as the game. He resigned and exactly that is what I do when I have such situation.  I enjoyed this game and I wish better luck for his future games. Thanks for viewing.                                                      End. }
