1. g4 {Hmmm....} d5 {I don't know how to play the opening, so i played with tempo.} 2. Bg2 {Leaving the pawn unprotected, but with a rick up his sleeves.} Bxg4 {Taking and not knowing the trick.} 3. c4 {BOOM!} e6 {Defending but sadly, my position started getting worse.} 4. Qb3 {He just keeps on attacking me!} Qc8 {My only defence with a good purpose.} 5. cxd5 {If i take the pawn, it  would be terrible.} c6 {So i decided that if he takes the c pawn, i would develop my knight with tempo, if he takes the e pawn, i would attack the queen with Bxe6.} 6. e4 {Not seeing my move.} cxd5 {Now i'm winning! I'm going to win a pawn or mate on c1} 7. exd5 {And he esinged because i will put mate on c1 now.}
