Bd2 O-O 8. e5 Bxd2+ 9. Nbxd2 Ne8 10. d5 {Instead of castling, I tried to attack...even risking myself by over extending my pawn. Post game analysis recommends that I should have castled} Ne7 11. Qb3 {Post game analysis again tells me that I should have castled. But then, his position is already cramped and this was the perfect time for me to launch an attack} d6 12. e6 fxe6 13. dxe6 Nf6 14. Ng5 d5 15. Bd3 Qd6 16. O-O c5 17. Qc2 Bxe6 {Indeed I over extended my e pawn. } 18. Nxh7 {but his greediness gives me an opportunity to attack his kingside} Rf7 19. Ng5 Rff8 20. Bh7+ Kh8 21. Rfe1 Bg8 {By this time, it took me a day to calculate my next move} 22. Bxg8 Kxg8 23. Re6 Qc7 24. Rae1 {I was pretending to attack the knight} Rae8 {and he responded by protecting it} 25.
