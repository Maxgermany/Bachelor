1. d4 f5 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bf4 {I do not have much experience playing against the dutch. I played Bf4 cuz it seems natural and aims at a weak point in blacks defense(c7). I also did not like the prospect that my bishop would be blocked by it's own pawns so I developed it out side the pawn chain. } Nf6 {The heart of black's counter attacks are through e4.} 4. e3 {The disadvantage of playing e3 is that it becomes an attacking point for black via f5-f4. } Bg7 5. Bc4 {Developing the bishop to it's optimal spot and slowing down black's development by preventing the immediate castling} d5 {I had planned for this so I was not surprised that Biggie played it. From my prespective it makes the center more static leading to a more quiet game.} 6. Be2 O-O 7. c4 {This is a typical move by me where I put immediate pressure on the centre. } Nh5 {I am not sure exactly what black was thinking here but it is too aggressive. I am a guy that like to keep a clean pawn chain so  I will not allow an exchange on f4. } 8. Be5 {This is a good reply to black's last move as it leaves white with greater control of the centre. } Nd7 {black rightly avoids the exchange of bishops because he gets no real advantage from it. White however, achieves that positional advantage of a nicely central knight. } 9. cxd5 {With this capture white completely owns the centre. As well it give white space to create attacking chances along the b2-g8 diagonal.} Nxe5 10. dxe5 {very nice pawns!} f4 {?? a clear blunder that weakens the king side for very little in return. I am not quite sure what black had in mind with this move. } 11. Nc3 {? An OK move but perhaps too risky in the fact that it allows black to open the f file for his rook. Much better is 11.E4 and it will be hard for black to draw. I am guilty of playing too passively. } Bg4 {Black increases his control of the  f file. } 12. O-O {?? This was my last chance to play the advantageous e4. I wanted to hold a semi balance on the f file and feared that my king would get stuck in the centre. playing e4 is clearly better after which black has his work cut out for himself to open the f file. } fxe3 13. fxe3 Bxf3 14. Rxf3 {! this forces the exchange of rooks and black losses any hopes of controlling the f file. } Bxe5 15. Rxf8+ Qxf8 16. Bxh5 {with black's chances of controlling the f file neutralized and with a clearly superior position I had straight into the endgame. } gxh5 17. Qxh5 Qg7 {However, because white allowed black to play fxe3 he does have the draw. The rest of the game is an exercise it frustration for me.} 18. Rf1 Rf8 19. Rxf8+ Kxf8 20. Ne4 Bxb2 21. Qf5+ Qf7 22. Qc8+ Kg7 23. Qxb7 Be5 24. Nd2 Qg6 25. Qb4 Kf8 26. Qb3 Qa6 27. Nc4 Bf6 28. h3 Ke8 29. Kh2 c6 30. Qb8+ Kd7 31. Ne5+ Bxe5+ 32. Qxe5 c5 33. Qf5+ Kd8 34. Qxh7 Qd6+ 35. Kg1 Qxd5 36. Qc2 c4 37. Kf2 c3 38. Qxc3 {1/2 1/2}
