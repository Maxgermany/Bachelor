1. e4 {Here is a recent league game I just completed. With the black pieces, I foolishly isolate my king with very little cover - throwing all of my resources towards a queenside attack. My opponent punishes me severely for this, and ultimately threatens mate in quick order. As I joked with him during the game, I was prepared to throw everything - including the kitchen sink:) - into an effort for a draw! Lo and behold it worked! This game reinforced an old chess adage to me, which is NEVER GIVE UP! Here we go.....my opponent opens with the very standard and solid 1.e4.} d5 {OK - no more jokes about me playing the Scandi. For those that know me, this is no surprise. I think my good friend blackbaron could write the scouting report on me - he has seen it enough:) My opponent in this game, vegiemite, handles my attempt to rip open the center quite well by playing....} 2. e5 {2.e5 - declining the "gambit" pawn and the dangers associated with it. In this version, white pushes e5 and plans for a BIG center.} c5 {The logical reply. Black clamps down on the d4 square and clears space on c6 for roomy development of his Nb8.} 3. d4 {White claims the big center, which makes sense. The danger here for white, however, is the possibility of black having two center pawns should exchanges occur - not deadly for him, but tricky to manage if not played correctly.} cxd4 {Black attempts to claim the central pawn advantage - albeit on his own side of the board.} 4. Qxd4 {White obviously maintains material equality. Again, this move is somewhat dangerous as his queen is now open to a developmental attack should black respond 4...Nb6.} a6 {! Having seen this position numerous times, black is well aware that 4...Nb6 is weak due to the vulnerability of the light colored squares. White stands better after 4...Nb6 5. Bb4, delivering a pin that is extremely strong.} 5. Nc3 {Interesting - a more usual response is 5. Nf3. I began to wonder if a sac on b5 was in my future......} e6 {Because of paranoia brought on by the many hundreds of times I have seen this, I intentionally "block in" my light squared bishop and hope to exchange it as quickly as possible. I have every intention of using it in a defensive role along the a4-e8 diagonal.} 6. f4 {Wow - white makes a big commitment. He intends to push hard on the kingside. I remember thinking that this move was a bit premature, perhaps, as any move that develops a piece was probably stronger.} Nc6 {Sufficiently satisfied that any attack on the light squares could be repelled, black develops with tempo.} 7. Qd3 {Not a whole lot of better alternatives here. This move does contain a latent weakness though, as it somewhat limits the scope of whites light squared bishop (which should be very powerful in this position).} Bb4 {This move accomplishes several things - it develops (with a pin), it clears a square for the Ng8 to develop to, and it hastens 0-0.} 8. Bd2 {Interposing the pin and preparing 0-0-0.} Nge7 {As planned.} 9. O-O-O {White takes the opportunity to secure his king. Now his main objective has GOT to be kingside development.} Bd7 {Last piece developed. This bishop is very weak, however, and is screaming to be exchanged at the first available opportunity.} 10. a3 {?! Not too sure about this one - kingside development makes more sense. Has white changed his mind and opted for a queenside attack? or has he just weakened his castled position? I must say I was confused. In this war of psychology I am definitely being toyed with:) If you are scoring at home, award vegiemite 10 style points:)} Bxc3 {Thinking that white's dark squared bishop won't be too dangerous on c3 because of his pawn on e5, black takes out the Nc3.  I remember thinking that the early 6.f4 by white may have just been a feint, as a big push on the queenside would be painful for me should I eventually play 0-0 - which could be very cramped indeed. Then I started counting pawns and swearing that he started the game with more than I did! It seems that white is poised to push on EITHER side of the board, and my so called "advantage" of central pawns was strictly an illusion. 10 more style points to vegiemite:)!} 11. Bxc3 {Of course.} Qc7 {A subtle X ray on the enemy king allowing the possibility of 0-0-0. I am really playing off of my heels at this point, as I have NO IDEA as to where the attack is going to come from, and I'll need as many defensive resources as I can get. White is in control, even with his lack of kingside development.} 12. Nf3 {Logical, albeit a little late development.} O-O {!? Always keep a quarter next to your mouse for situations such as this. Sometimes a coin flip is all you have:) While that is HORRIBLE technical advice, that is precisely the situation I found myself in. I simply could not wait any longer for white to reveal his plan to me. I had to make a commitment to get some sort of idea as to what MY plan was going to be. As it turned out, I probably chose incorrectly, as my commitment to attacking on the queenside is easily rebuffed. Give vegiemite another 10 points for forcing me into an ugly decision:)} 13. Nd4 {White continues to confound me. I would have bet the farm that he would get moving on the kingside. Perhaps he saw something that I didn't. What I see in this position is the opportunity to clear pieces - which makes sense to me as I'm the one with the cramped position.} Nxd4 {I oblige, hoping to open up the scope of my light squared bishop.} 14. Bxd4 {Again, I'm tortured....I really counted on 14.QxN because of two things - 1) the white queen is vulnerable to a pin after 14...Bb5 2) black can load up on the c file with a wicked attack on c2 after 14...(either) Rc8. My opponent is in my head big time.} Rfc8 {Black is committed to play along the queenside. White can go either way. Advantage white.} 15. Rd2 {A nice rook lift that protects the potentially vulnerable c2. This rook can now slide along the 2nd rank if need be in support of a kingside push.} Nc6 {As solid as white is on both sides, he still has not commited himself one way or the other. Black decides to rev things up, and hopes to exchange knight for bishop.} 16. c3 {Yet another move that left me scratching my head. I was sure that his light squared bishop was going to develop. The choice of whether or not to remove the bishop was a tough one. I decided not to, as.....} Na5 {....there was a nice hole on b3 that my knight would love to reach - checking and throwing a mean fork on his Rd2 and Bd4.} 17. Kc2 {White denies my knight access to b6, so a very pleasing.......} Nc4 {....Nc4 post is achieved. Since white must cede back a little tempo to protect his Rd2, black begins toying with some sacrificing ideas to take advantage of the fact that white has still not developed his Bf1 (which by definition still blocks in his Rh1). If played correctly, black now has the opportunity to start being the aggressor.} 18. Rd1 {Obviously seeing the potentail dangers ahead, white retreats to the 1st rank to get some support behind his pawns.} a5 {As black is sure that a pawn push to b4 will fail to Nxa , the b4 square is hit again in preparation for b5!, which should cause white some valuable time to defend against.} 19. g4 {White follows an old chess axiom - when your opponent pushes on one side, you push on the other! White evidently sees (or did he see all along?) how vulnerable the black king is all alone in the corner.} b5 {Let's take a moment to analyze the whole board - the battle lines have finally been drawn 100%. White is going to attack on the kingside, black on the queenside. Space is roughly equal. Pawn structure favors white. Piece placement favors black. White is behind in development, but black has some serious worries regarding the safety of his king. This is going to very painful for SOMEBODY!} 20. Qh3 {! I failed to see how powerful this move is, and paid for it big time.} Ra6 {? An utter waste of a move. The intent was to triple up on the c file after 21...Rc6. That idea was just wishful thinking because of.....} 21. Bd3 {! h7 is now in a world of hurt. White masterfully decimates blacks castled position over the next few moves.} g6 {Sensing that this was better than 21...h6 to prevent the mate, as black's dark squared bishop is nicely restrained from entering the fray for now.} 22. f5 {White starts salivating. He knows that black MUST re-take to prevent 23. f6! which is brutal because Qh6 followed by mate on g7 cannot be stopped.} Nxe5 {!? Whoa...black preserves his pawn shield for the moment and is prepared to play Nxg after white plays f6. This move also opens the door to other sac opportunities if there is time to play b4! If white captures on e5 then black will have won a pawn after QxB. This is a very complex position, no doubt. I remember thinking that one of us was surely going to have a story to tell after this game. I am extending an open invitation to all to comment and critique this position. I am especially interested in a critique of my 22...Nxe5.} 23. Qh6 {! Another strong move! White sees that 23...Nxg fails because of 24. Qg7 checkmate!} exf5 {As I have now pinned my knight to his own tombstone on e5, I attempt to clear space for both my Ra6 and Bd7 to manuever over towards a defense of my king.} 24. gxf5 {White re-takes and keeps up the pressure. It is as this point that I realize that my Ra6 is totally weak on the sixth rank because my g pawn cannot move! Any action on f5 will favor white. Black appears to be busted.} Bxf5 {Black is forced to sac his light squared bishop.} 25. Bxf5 {White happily gains the material and continues to maintain all threats, with a nice attack on blacks Rc8 to boot.} Re8 {Black is forced to move this rook to preserve it, and the "logical" place to put it defends a piece that CANNOT be moved! 10 more style points to vegiemite!} 26. h4 {White shows good patience, and hurries yet ANOTHER threat to the dismally weak pawn on g6. He can continue to build overwhelming threats (such as a rook to g1) while black desperately tries to defend.} b4 {26...gxB not only loses the Ra6 but hastens a white attack down the g file. Black is firing into the dark, hoping to hit SOMETHING.} 27. h5 {! More pain for the g pawn.} Rc6 {Protecting the rook with the queen, and realizing that this is probably going to be the last move white will allow before going in for the kill. Black has been reduced to kamakazi tactics for survival.} 28. Rdg1 {And the table is set.  White tucks his napkin into his collar, gets the salt and pepper ready, and prepares to dig in.} b3+ {BONSAI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Black prays white will take so that a life saving check can be delivered.} 29. Kxb3 {?? White gets greedy. 29.Kb1 wins.} Rb8+ {All ideas of defense are forgotten about. Black must check or die.} 30. Kc2 {? Ka4 was actually stronger, as a check threat from b4 could be eliminated by a pawn.} Rxb2+ {! I took some time with this move, seeing that it may just be possible to draw this game if I could deliver a check somehow with my knight.} 31. Kxb2 {? Feeling confident that he could withstand my last ditch effort, vegiemite eliminates that particular threat. However......} Nc4+ {Keep moving king.....I'll sac again on c3 if I have to. I felt like David loading one lowly little rock into his slingshot at this point, just praying for the chance to sling it.} 32. Kc1 {! Getting to a square which cannot be safely checked (32...Qf4  loses the queen and the game immediately). So....} Ne5 {The knight returns to e5, which has been incredibly weak the whole game. However, it is a jumping off point to d3, which has possibilities if it can be played. Black is committed to yet another sac on c3 next.} 33. hxg6 {White has mate in one. Any move that black makes MUST deliver check or the game is over.} Rxc3+ {! not Nd3 , as the white king can move to d2 and there are no more checks available for black.} 34. Bxc3 {White still has an overwhelming material advantage, so he removes the threat.} Qxc3+ {Of course. Black must now keep the white king on the QUEENSIDE to prevent him from getting any help from his other pieces. } 35. Kd1 {White moves towards his protective pieces.} Qf3+ {! With the chance to pick off the white bishop.} 36. Kc2 {? black picks up the free bishop with a check. Ke1 was the better play, as the assault could have been withstood after 37. Nd3  BxN.} Qxf5+ {Black's persistence is about to pay off.} 37. Kc1 {? White is obviously playing on tilt and not making the best decisions. This move allows black the luxury of utilizing his knight.} Nd3+ {Black has no illusions of winning here. A draw is the goal. The knight MUST be sacrificed to get the white king away from the c1-h8 diagonal.} 38. Kc2 {? Black now thinks a draw is a lock, and a win may even be possible. White walks right into a discovered check.} Nf4+ {Black checks again with the discovered check that (temporarily) blocks the white queen from getting back to help defend.} 39. Kb3 {And the long sought after draw is assured. White probably saw this as well, and didn't want to risk losing the full point.} Qd3+ {Of course.} 40. Ka4 {Kb2 could allow the black knight back into the hunt in two moves.} Qc4+ {Of course.} 41. Kxa5 {Forced.} Qc5+ {And the draw is in the bag. } 42. Ka6 {Forced again.} Qc6+ {That's 14 checks in the last 15 moves.} 43. Ka7 {And draw agreed on. Many thanks to my new friend vegiemite for  a very challenging game! I'm sure that we both learned some valuable lessons from it:)  Cheers:)  Thomas}
