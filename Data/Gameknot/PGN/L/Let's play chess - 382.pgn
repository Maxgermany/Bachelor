1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 {hmmm, not the best continuation. It opens up the king, and locks up the knight on g8.} 3. Nc3 {Not the best move for me either. I think I should have played d4.} c6 4. d3 {Again, I think it would be better to play d4} d5 5. b3 Bb4 {This stopped me from going Bb2.} 6. Bd2 Qb6 {Not so sure why he played this.} 7. g4 {I think I blacked out or something. What a bad move!} Bc5 {A blunder, and I punished him badly.} 8. Na4 {Na4, and he resigned. His bishop is lost. The game would be on like this: 8...Bxf2, 9.Ke2, Qc7, 10.Kxf2. He would lose later on. Thank you for watching!}
