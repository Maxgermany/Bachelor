1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {4... e5 is a mistake in this opening.} 5. Nf3 Bg4 {This Bishop is needed to drive pieces away from the hole at d5. 5...Be6 was what the doctor ordered!} 6. Bc4 Qc7 {Queen needed to move here on move 5, in order to prevent the Bishop going to c4.} 7. Bb3 Nf6 {Although this simple developing move prevents the Maroczy Bind, (c4 preventing d5) Black's grip of the d5 square was lost long ago.} 8. Nc3 Be7 9. O-O Nc6 10. Bg5 {White should play a3, incase of Na5, preserving his Bishop for the a2-g8 diagonal. Removing a potential defender of the d5 square is not a bad idea though.} Nd4 {This highlights the inaccuracy of White's last move. If he was to move his dark squared Bishop, he should have moved it to e3 in anticipation of this move. White has no control over whether he keeps his King's Bishop. In this position, Black needs to take b3, and then retreat his Bishop to c6 via d7.} 11. h3 {A waste of time, which forces the issue. Here White should play Bxf6.} Bxf3 {Although this cripples White's Kingside Pawns, after the exchanges, Black will not have sufficient means to attack the scattered Pawns; this cannot compensate for the "chasm" on d5.} 12. gxf3 O-O {Black squanders his last chance to preserve a defender for the crucial d5 square.} 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Nd5 {White fears the Bishop using f4 or h4 as an outpost and the weakness of the f Pawns.} Qd8 15. Nxf6+ Qxf6 16. Kg2 Qg5+ 17. Kh2 Qf4+ 18. Kg2 Kh8 {A waiting move? Is Black intending to play f5? The Black King feels safer on this square, but where is the threat from White? Black desperately needed to take the Bishop, which is lucky to still be on the board. In going all out for his stategy of fixing d5 as a weakness, White's development has been slow and inaccurate. Black, on the other hand, despite dreaming of winning the f3 Pawn, cannot drive the King away from guard duty at the same time as threatening the Pawn. Here, Black may have played for a draw by three-fold repitition, with Qg5-f4-g5-f4 etc.} 19. Bd5 {The move we've all been waiting for; the Bishop goes to its best square at the first opportunity.} Rab8 20. c3 Qg5+ 21. Kh2 Ne6 22. Rg1 Qf4+ 23. Rg3 b6 {Weakening the light squares on the Queenside, making the Bishop more powerful than either of Black's Rooks. } 24. Bb3 Rbd8 {White forces Black to defend passively, in order to complete his development.} 25. Qe2 h5 26. Qe3 h4 {Playing into White's hands, who, albeit rather slowly, is at least able to transfer his Rooks to the Queenside.} 27. Qxf4 Nxf4 28. Rg4 Ng6 29. Rd1 Kh7 {Another King move?} 30. Rgg1 f5 {Black eyes the f2 Pawn as a target.} 31. Rd2 Nf4 32. Rgd1 fxe4 33. fxe4 Rf6 34. a4 {A multi-purpose move. White intends to fix Blacks Pawns for the mobility of his own pieces. The d8 Rook is en prise; White can use his Queenside Pawn majority to secure a passed Pawn.} g5 {A risky move. White cannot attack the h4 Pawn, so it needs no defence; Blacks Pawn structure enables the Bishop to have the freedom of the whole board! Has there ever been a more powerful Bishop in the History of Chess?} 35. Ba2 {Preparing to throw Pwans forward.} Rdf8 {A blunder! Poor Black is targeting f2 again; the Knight has to move and this allows White's King to defend the f2 Pawn.} 36. Rd2xd6 Ne6 {How often in Chess is a blunder followed by an even bigger one? White will be a piece to two Pawns up. Sacrificing the Knight does not allow Black to get perpetual check.} 37. Rxe6 Rf6xf2+ 38. Kg1 Rxb2 {Committing suicide! Had Black's Rook been on f6, his game was still lost. White's scattered Pawns would not have been difficult to defend with an extra piece.} 39. Rd7+ Kh8 40. Rh6# {Mate would not have been possible if the Bishop wasn't able to own this diagonal - it wins the game for White without making a check of its own!! A fine example of the Bishop's latent power, more typically seen in the Fianccheto Bishop.}
