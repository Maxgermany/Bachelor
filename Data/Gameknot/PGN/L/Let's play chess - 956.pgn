1. e4 {This was a standard game between two low-ranked players.} e5 2. Bc4 Qh4 {An unusual (and doubtful) move. The only threat is Qxe4, which I easily blocked.} 3. d3 {A better defence might have been Nc3, developing a piece.} c6 {Another eclectic move, which opens up no more space for black. If it was meant in a long-term defensive way, guarding against a push through the centre at d5, why play the queen so strangely?} 4. Nc3 Bc5 5. Nf3 {This, of course, allows Qxf2#. I had prepared Be3 as a response to Bc5, but forgot to play it! I would deserved to lose here, but luckily for me black missed the opportunity.} Qg4 6. O-O {Avoids the threat of mate.} b5 {A reasonable move, pushing forwards and forcing me to defend.} 7. Bb3 a5 {Threatens 8... a4, trapping the bishop.} 8. a4 {My intention was to continue 8... bxa4 9 Nxa4, attacking c5 and preserving good development. At all costs I wanted to prevent 8... a4, trapping my bishop.} b4 {A clever move, keeping up pressure on white's queen-side and forcing the knight to retreat.} 9. Ne2 d5 10. exd5 {Black's pawn storm was pushing me further and further back. I chose this moment to blunt his advance without sacrificing material.} Qg6 {Black had been playing better since a strange first few moves, but here he slipped again, allowing me to win a pawn.} 11. dxc6 Nxc6 12. Bd5 Bb7 13. Nxe5 {13... Nxe5 14 Bxb7, winning another pawn. Of course, the Ne5 also threatens the black queen.} Nxe5 14. Bxb7 Rb8 15. Nf4 Qf5 16. Be4 Qd7 17. Re1 {Building up towards a pin or discovered check along the e-file.} Ng4 {?? Completely missing white's plan.} 18. Bc6+ {This was exactly the move I had hoped to be able to play. The black queen is now lost.} Kd8 19. Bxd7 Kxd7 20. Qxg4+ {Forking g7, threatening to win the rook on h8.} Kc7 21. Nd5+ {21... Kc6/d6 22 Qxg7, and black cannot take the knight without losing a rook.} Kd6 22. Qxg7 Ne7 23. Qe5+ Kd7 24. Nxe7 Rhe8 25. Qxc5 Rbc8 {25... Rxe7 26 Rxe7 } 26. Qd5+ Kc7 27. Bf4+ {At this point, I had a clear lead in both material and position. In the rest of the game I simply forced black's king further and further back to try and mate him.} Kb6 28. Nxc8+ {28... Ka6 29 Qa8#} Rxc8 29. Qb5+ Ka7 30. Re7+ {30... Rc7 31 Rxc7  Ka8 32 Qb7#} Ka8 31. Qa6# {Thank you for reading my annotation. Comments are welcome.}
