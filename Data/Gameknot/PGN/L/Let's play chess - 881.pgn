1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 Bb4+ 4. Bd2 {E11 : bogo indian defense, nimzovitch variation} c5 5. Bxb4 {Best move according to GK database. It reinforced white center. } cxb4 6. g3 {To put the bishop in fianchetto.} b6 {Black hurry to put his own bishop in fianchetto too, contesting white the h1-a8 diagonal} 7. Bg2 Bb7 8. O-O O-O 9. Nbd2 {May be a3 to develop the knigh on c3 and play on the queenside.} d6 10. Re1 Nc6 {Both player almost finished the development. White as more space, black can operate on the c file. b4 pawn is not really weak as it can be reinforced by a5. I consider game even.} 11. e4 e5 {Preventing e5, and giving white choices :  - pushing d5, with fixed center (weak,ess on c4, hole on c5 : beurk)  - taking dxe with an open game  - protect d4 and keep pressure} 12. Nb3 {Nf1 is better, to "rebounce" on e3, then d5 or f5. On b3, the poor beast has nowhere to go.} a5 {Threatening a4, then white pieces are messed. I was not tempted by Rc1 a4, Na1, so I choose the other evil.} 13. d5 Ne7 14. Nbd2 Qd7 15. a4 {Played to avoid Rfc8 followed by b5 and Qxb5. If black do not take, b3 lock the queenside, then action will switch to the kingside ans white can breath a bit.} bxa3 e.p. 16. Rxa3 a4 {Prevent b3. Here I considered my position ugly. The bishop is bad, knights have no good square, except b5 (a bit far), c4 and c5 are weak square, no prospect on the kingside, Rooks are disconnected. No harmony. } 17. Qe2 {Protect c4 and e4 to free d2 knight for the trip Nb1-c3-b5. Qa1-a2 Ra1 b3 might have been another stupid plan. But...} Ba6 18. Rc1 b5 { ! If c5, then b4 win. So,} 19. cxb5 {or Qd1 bxc, Rxa4 with still an edge for black} Bxb5 20. Qe3 Rac8 {To exchange white active rook, as I cannot give him the column.} 21. Rac3 Rxc3 22. Rxc3 Nfxd5 {! Well played : exd Nxd, Qe1 Nxc3, bxc and  1) the a3 pawn becomes dangerous, 2) Black center will run forward with the help of Q B R, 3) c3 pawn is weak. } 23. exd5 Nxd5 24. Nxe5 {Counter sacrifice ! Aiming for a draw after the following exchange. } dxe5 {Better than Q and N exchanged that would lead to a draw} 25. Bxd5 Qxd5 26. Rc5 Qd7 27. Rxe5 {But now that white bishop has gone, the king castle is unsafe...} Bc6 28. Nf3 {Qd1 , Ne1 does not seem dangerous.} Rb8 29. Nd4 {Intending to push the bishop, and follow with Re7 but ...} a3 {!! White is lost (what ? I was already lost for more than 10 moves so nothing new ? Nevermind) A) bxa3 ?? Rb1# B) b3 a2 -  C) Nxc6 axb, Nxb8 b1Q  Qe1 and black can choose to win with 1 or 3Q on the board. D) Re7 axb !!, Rxd7 b1Q  and mate follow. I tried to resist without the knight.} 30. Qxa3 Qxd4 31. Qe7 Qd1+ 32. Re1 Qf3 33. Kf1 {Conditional moves up to mate} Qg2+ 34. Ke2 Rxb2+ 35. Kd3 Qd5+ {A) Ke3 mate in 1 B) Kc3 mate in 3 so resign.
