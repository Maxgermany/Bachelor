1. e3 d5 2. h4 e5 3. g3 f5 {This defence worked once before, but I suspect it is inherently weak?} 4. b3 Be6 {Part of the weakness.  the three pawns need suport of the big guns.} 5. Bb2 Bd6 {See?} 6. Nh3 h6 7. a4 Nf6 {Interesting pawn structures here.  } 8. Nc3 Ne4 {Looks cool, but do I have a good attack platform?} 9. Qh5+ {Outflanked! Can't pull the white Bishop to block as that would leave f5 open to his Queen.} Kd7 {So I must flee.} 10. Bb5+ {This works for me, as I} c6 {can reinforce d5 and repel the Bishop with c6.} 11. d3 {Retreat?} Nxc3 {Not an option...  He must have blundered...} 12. Bxc3 cxb5 {Nice lunch!  But,} 13. axb5 {His pawn now traps my Knight and Rook.} a6 {If I had moved to a5, he might have captured in passant.  allowing my rook to escape.} 14. Qg6 Qf6 {Not welcome here.} 15. Qh5 {I don't like my defences.  The three pawns have my power pieces tied up.} Rc8 {I could get a pawn here.} 16. f4 {?} Rxc3 {That will hurt.} 17. O-O {!!??!!} Rxc2 {OK, thanks!} 18. Ng5 Rc5 19. d4 exd4 20. Nf7 Qxf7 {I regretted this capture, wishing I had used the bishop.  I had to return the Queen later.} 21. Qe2 {He's loath to trade.....} Qf6 22. b4 Rxb5 23. Ra4 {!?! I'm glad he didn't see he could trade his Queen for 2 Rooks.  (QxR, PxQ, RxR.  I would have been tempted....)} Rxb4 {But protected his pawn instead.} 24. Rfa1 {Which I took anyway.} Nc6 {Free at last!} 25. Qd1 Rxa4 26. Rxa4 b5 27. Rxd4 Nxd4 {This will be over soon.} 28. exd4 Qg6 29. Qe1 Bxf4 30. Kg2 Qxg3+ 31. Kf1 a5 32. Qe2 Qh3+ 33. Ke1 Qe3 34.
