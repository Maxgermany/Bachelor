1. d4 {My favorite move of all time. Most likely when people play against me, you'll see me play this move at all times. I don't like playing e4 because I don't like seeing main openings that usually involve way too much theory such as Sicilian Defence or Ruy Lopez, and much more.} c6 {When my opponent played this move, I thought about two openings that I could play against. If I play e4, we could go into a Caro Kann, which is a very boring opening to play against to me or we could play against the Slav Defence, which is something I'm more prepare of playing against since I know mostly all moves after d4} 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Trying to pin my knight down so it wont get any play during the game} 4. Qc2 Nf6 {When my opponent play this move now, for some reason I thought about the Nimzo Indian but the only difference is that c5 haven't been played until later on during the game. So I said to myself "why not play into a Nimzo Indian game" type of step up.} 5. e3 O-O 6. Bd3 g6 7. Nge2 {At this point of the game, I was happy with my position because if you notice that my pieces at developing smoothly into the game. I really don't have to worry about the pin anymore because of Nge2 and I'm pretty much ready to castle. For my opponent, things are not looking so good. The fact that his knight and bishop have no places to go that are on b8 and c8, it slows down his development. Also, by playing g6 it creates a weakness, which you'll see later on during the game on how I took advantage of that move.} Bxc3+ 8. Nxc3 d5 9. b3 {This move right here indicates that I don't want my opponent to have control over the center. Also, I could look into playing Ba3 at some point later on if I really need to play that move. Since g6 was play, my dark square bishop belongs on the a1-h8 diagonal } dxc4 10. bxc4 Na6 {Now he wants to get his pieces into the game, but of course I want to make it extremely hard for my opponent to get no play at all} 11. a3 c5 12. Ne2 b6 13. O-O Bb7 14. Bb2 {Finally my development is complete. I got all my pieces where I want them to be. At this point of the game I knew there should be no reason why I can't win this game. The knight on a6 does not belong there at all. Knights belong in the middle of the board. By the time he gets it into action, I would've been looking for checkmate} Qd6 15. Qc3 Qc6 {I was in no fear of this move. In fact I didn't even pay it no attention. I only saw one thing in mind and that was CHECKMATE along the a1-h8 diagonal} 16. f3 Qd6 17. dxc5 Qe7 18. Qxf6 Qxf6 19. Bxf6 {After taking on f6, I dont ever have to worry about this piece being attack at all} Nxc5 20. Bc2 Ba6 {When my opponent made this move, I started to think for a bit here. After looking and thinking for about 15 minutes or so, I saw checkmate in 3, so I really didn't care if he took the pawn.} 21. Nd4 Bxc4 22. Nc6 h5 {very good move. My opponent obviously saw checkmate coming when he realize where my knight was going. Now its time to move my rook. By the way ladies and gentlemen, I NEVER move the rook on a1 at all. Its all about the this rook I'm about to move next} 23. Rfd1 b5 {I instantly saw checkmate again after this move and I was happy. My plan is to move the rook to d4, follow by Rh4....Ne7  and finish it off with Rxh5 mate.} 24. Rd4 a5 25. Rh4 Kh7 {To be honest, I wasn't really looking forward to this move. I thought he would attact my knight at least with Rfc8 to by some time in the game. There might not be much play for him, but at least checkmate is not that easy anymore. From this move on, there's only checkmate in two. Of course after Rxh5 check, the pawn can't take because its being pin down to my bishop on c2. But I would like to say that my opponent is a good chess player and hope to play against him again later on.} 26. Rxh5+ Kg8 27. Rh8# {}
