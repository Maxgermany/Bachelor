1. e4 {I am pleased with this game.  I don't understand why white never castled maybe he underestimated me.  I think he had plenty of time.  He must have thought he had an advantage on the king side but I was not worried about his pawns coming down as I could still castle and get away. } e6 {White opened with e4 and I responded with e6 preparing to move pawn to d5} 2. Nf3 d5 {White's knight came to f3 and I moved pawn to d5} 3. Nc3 c5 {White's knight came to c3 and I moved c pawn out to c5 protected by DB at f8.  I have allowed the pawns to protect themselves but must now start to move the pieces out.} 4. d4 a6 {Still more pawns moved with white moving to d4 and I moved to a6.} 5. h4 Nf6 {White moved pawn to h4 and I now moved knight to f6.} 6. Bg5 Be7 {White moved to attack knight at f3 and I moved DB to protect the knight.} 7. Bxf6 Bxf6 {White took the knight and I took back.} 8. g4 Qa5 {White moved another pawn out to g4 and I moved queen to a5.  Allowing me to castle next move.} 9. g5 Be7 {Now white pushed g pawn forcing me to move DB back to e6.} 10. Bh3 g6 {White's LB moved to h3 and I pushed g pawn to stop progress of g5 pawn.} 11. exd5 Bd7 {White took my pawn on d5 and I developed LB to d7 knowing that white will take on e6 and my bishop will recapture.  } 12. dxe6 Bxe6 {As predicted I took pawn with my LB following the capture of my pawn.} 13. Bxe6 fxe6 {White's LB took my pawn at e6 and I captured it with pawn at f7.  This has now left a gap and may not be so easy to castle kingside.} 14. Ne5 Rf8 {After white's f knight moves to e5 rook comes to f8 alongside king to take control of the f file which only has a pawn at f2.} 15. h5 Nc6 {White continues to push his pawns on the kingside with pawn to h5 and I develop my b knight to c6.  Attacking the knight at e5.} 16. Nxc6 bxc6 {White captures my knight at c6 and I recapture with my pawn doubling my pawns on the c file.} 17. hxg6 O-O-O {White takes my pawn at g6 and I now castle queenside.} 18. Rxh7 Bxg5 {My last kingside pawn is captured by rook at h7 and I move my DB  out to g5.} 19. Qg4 c4 {Now white moves his queen to g4 threatening my bishop at g5 and I push my c pawn which allows my queen to protect the bishop.} 20. Qxg5 Qxg5 {White captures my bishop and I recapture with my queen.} 21. Rh1 Rfh8 {White decides to remove his rook now since my castling brought my rooks together and the rook would have been in trouble.  I move my f rook across to h8 attacking the h1 rook.} 22. Ne4 Rxh1+ {White left his rook at h1 and instead brought his knight to e4.  So I captured the h1 rook and put his king in check.} 23. Ke2 Qg4+ {White moved his king to e2 and I checked the king again with my queen also attacking the knight at the same time.} 24. f3 Qg2+ {Whited moved pawn to f3 and I moved my queen to g2 again checking the king.  I still have white's rook at a8 which I have not forgotten about.} 25. Nf2 Rxa1 {White brings his knight back to halt my check and I take white's rook at a1.} 26. a3 Qf1+ 27. Ke3 {I aim to take the knight so will remove the king and then take it.  So I move my queen to f1 and check the king which moves out to e3.} Re1+ 28. Kf4 {Next I bring the rook back across to check the king and he now moves out to f4 leaving the knight at the queen's mercy.} Qxf2 {At this stage once I had taken his last piece white resigned.}
