1. c4 c5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 e6 4. Bg2 d5 {I try to play active with black - because I much higher then my opponent.} 5. cxd5 exd5 6. d4 cxd4 {I develop the knight with tempo.} 7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd1 d4 {maybe the only way to defend my pawn. After Be6 Bg5 makes problems.} 9. Ne4 Nxe4 10. Bxe4 Bb4+ 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12. Qxd2 Qe7 13. Bxc6+ {I have oversee this. Instead Qe7 a Be6 could be good enough.} bxc6 {my pieces are active, I loose a pawn, but then I castle and all my pieces can attack - anyway, white can be better after Qxd4 0-0 Nf3} 14. Qxd4 O-O 15. Nf3 Rd8 16. Qc4 Bh3 {to prevent 0-0, so I get a quality - I give a bishop for the rook stay out of game... That's good for my pawn. If Qxc6 now, I play Qb4  if Nd2, Qxd2#, if Qc3 after Qxc3 bxc3 and Rd8, then Rg1 is a must for white and after Bg4 the king must go to f1 and black's position is good enough.} 17. Qh4 Qd7 {Rg1 Bg4 and after the exchange Qd2  with winning the b2 and the a2 pawn, because he cannot defend the rook on a1.} 18. e3 {Rg1!!!} Bg2 19. Ke2 Qd3+ {it is over...} 20. Ke1 {Bxf3 and the mate on e2 is unstoppable.}
