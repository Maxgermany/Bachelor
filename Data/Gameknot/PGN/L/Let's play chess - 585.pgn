1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {The Four Knights' Game, usually considered quite drawish.} 4. a3 {I'm not sure why this was played. The situation seems to call for continued development.} Bc5 {I exploit the time-wasting Pawn move by seizing an advantage in development.} 5. b4 {Another wasted move. The rule in the opening is ironclad: move your pieces out quickly and only make necessary Pawn moves, or else your middle-game will be inferior.} Bb6 6. Bb2 {If White wants to fianchetto the Bishop, 4 P-QN3 and 5 B-N2 accomplish the task a move quicker.} d6 7. Bc4 {Preparing to castle.} O-O {I secure my King...} 8. O-O {...as does my opponent.} Bg4 {Clearing the last minor piece off the back rank.} 9. Be2 {Breaking the pin.} Qd7 {My development is complete now, as my Rooks are connected. White still must move his Q off the back rank, so I have a slight advantage in time. Time advantages, however, must be converted before they evaporate.} 10. h3 Be6 {I see no reason to exchange Bishop for Knight at this stage.} 11. Bb5 a6 {Now I'm the one putting the question.} 12. Ba4 {Maintaining the pin.} Ba7 {I clear my Bishop out of the way and prepare to lock the Q-side with ...P-QN4.} 13. Bxc6 {It is not necessary for White to concede the minor exchange here. 13 B-N3 would be acceptable, although I could choose to respond with 13...BxB, doubling the White QNP's.} Qxc6 {I complete the exchange.} 14. d3 b5 {The Pawn structure on the Q-side is now virtually locked, meaning that the game will proceed at a more sedate pace. Instead of wild attacks, positional maneuvers will be the order of the day.} 15. Bc1 {A mistake, although I miss the fact I can respond 15...QxN.} h6 16. Be3 {Apparently White wanted to reposition his Bishop on this diagonal. I'm not sure why, since it allows me to trade off my less mobile KB and preserve my well-positioned, quite mobile QB.} Bxe3 {I seize the chance to get rid of his last Bishop and swap off my KB.} 17. fxe3 {White completes the exchange...} Qxc3 {...but this time I don't miss the chance to capture the loose Knight.} 18. Nh4 Qc6 {Having seized a material advantage, I get my Queen back into my lines.} 19. Nf5 {An error in judgment. Down a full piece, White should avoid giving me opportunities to simplify the game.} Bxf5 {Off comes White's last minor piece.} 20. exf5 {A minor consolation for White is that the KP is undoubled.} e4 {I need to exchange at least one Pawn to ensure that White can't lock the Pawn position into a drawing fortress.} 21. d4 {White does not oblige.} Nd5 {White overlooked a Queen capture earlier. Could I possibly be so lucky as to have him overlook a Knight fork?} 22. Qh5 {In a word, no. But I'm still up a piece and the White KP is hanging.} Kh7 {Time for the K to seek shelter. White's only real chance is an attack that either mates or wins back the material. With good defense, I should be able to prevent this.} 23. g4 g6 {If White exchanges Pawns, I could possibly get rid of a pair of Rooks...} 24. fxg6+ fxg6 {Exchange complete, and the Queen must now retreat.} 25. Qh4 Nxe3 {Might as well get a passed Pawn while I have a chance.} 26. Rf6 {White tries to gin up an attack.} Rxf6 {I naturally take the opportunity to swap down.} 27. Qxf6 Qe8 {As long as I can keep White's QR from coordinating with the Queen, I should be able to repulse the attack.} 28. c3 Qf8 {If he exchanges off the Queens, the game is won for me.} 29. Qe6 Re8 {Another swipe at the Queen.} 30. Qa2 {White could easily have resigned here. With the Queen forced to retreat, the attack is over and the ending is lost. However, White continues on.} d5 {Sealing the diagonal.} 31. Re1 Nc4 {Planting the Knight where it can't be removed.} 32. Rf1 Qe7 {Lining up a battery behind the passed KP.} 33. Rf2 e3 {Pushing forwards.} 34. Re2 {Blockading...} c6 {Taking the time to solidify my Pawns.} 35. Qb1 {Switching to a new diagonal.} Qe4 36. Qf1 Qe7 {At this point, White resigns. His position isn't any worse than it was 5-10 moves ago... but he gives up the fight now.}
