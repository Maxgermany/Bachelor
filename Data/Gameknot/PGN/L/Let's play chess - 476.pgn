1. e4 {I'm not good in openings and go for instinct rather than the book ' this time i chose the king side.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {take it or leave it !} Nf6 4. Nc3 {interesting symmetry, I also chose not to take} exd4 {breaking the ice !} 5. Nxd4 {I chose the knight an leave the queen later ...} c5 6. Bb5+ {develop for future O-O, protect knight by attacking the king} Bd7 {there were both knights and the bishop to protect} 7. Nf5 {I chose to triple attack d6 pawn in a future exchange of bishops while i will lose e4 pawn} Bxb5 {as predicted} 8. Nxb5 Nxe4 9. Qd5 {so far as predicted but didn't expect next oponent move ...} Qa5+ {yep' good one, in case i put the knight on c3 or the bishop on d2 his knight would certainly go for an exchange because is hanging there with no defense ad it will win material !} 10. c3 {so I chose pawn c3} Qxb5 11. Qxe4+ Kd7 12. Qd5 {i have to win back material so d6 is mine :) "it was in my mind" and maybe my thoughts were received by the opponent because of his next move} Ke8 13. Nxd6+ Bxd6 14. Qxd6 Nd7 15. a4 {this move i didn't understand why i made it, his queen was ok there not on the battlefield } Qc6 {g2 pawn is ok for me as long as my plans are on the go} 16. Bf4 {protect queen, prepare castling leading to double attack on d column and another diagonal for the bishop !} Qxg2 {taking bait, an exchange of queens would have led the game into overtime} 17. O-O-O Qc6 {too late, mate in 4 from this point !!} 18. Rhe1+ Kd8 19. Qe7+ Kc8 20. Qe8+ {sweet sacrifice} Rxe8 21. Rxe8# {the end !! hope you enjoyed }
