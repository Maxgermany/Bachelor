1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 {Sicilian, Najdorf Variation, English Attack} 7. Nde2 {An uncommon reply, blocking the light bishop. Usually played is Nb3 or Nf3 here.} Be6 {Always being cautious to guard the hole on d5 in this opening. } 8. f4 {Probably best, attacking my weak center pawns, and maybe aiming to exploit the hole on d5 by removing the defender (playing f5)} Nc6 {An aggressive, rather untested move. } 9. f5 {Probably best, still pressuring the center, harassing the bishop, and working towards exploiting the hole.} Bc4 10. Qd2 {Definately not white's best move here.. probably best is Ng3, forcing Bxf1 Rxf1, where white will castle long. } d5 {Taking control of the center, given the opportunity!} 11. exd5 Nxd5 12. O-O-O {A disaster.. White needed to play Nxd5 before castling!} Bb4 {Now the pin is devastating, as more pieces swarm around the white king.} 13. a3 Qa5 {Bringing my queen into the growing attack, and exploiting the weakness of the white king.} 14. axb4 {It's difficult to find the best move, probably Kb1 or even Qxd5 is best here.. white is in material trouble though.} Ncxb4 {Now the threats are everywhere and cannot be stopped.} 15. Qe1 Nxe3 16. Rd2 {Allowing a quick ending.} Qa1+ 17. Nb1 Na2# {}
