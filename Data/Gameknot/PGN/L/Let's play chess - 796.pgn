1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 {Main line Caro-Kann.} 5. Nc3 e6 6. Nf3 Nf6 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. Qxd3 Be7 9. Bd2 O-O 10. O-O-O {This unbalanced position could become dangerous for either castled K.} Nbd7 11. Ne5 {This gives me a chance to sneak a pawn in a couple of moves.} Nxe5 12. dxe5 Qxd3 13. cxd3 Ng4 {Fork.} 14. Be3 Nxe5 {I feel better snagging a central pawn.} 15. f4 Ng4 16. Rde1 Nxe3 17. Rxe3 Rad8 18. g4 h6 19. Rd1 Rd4 20. Re4 Rfd8 21. Kc2 {I can exchange toward an endgame while a pawn ahead.} Rxe4 22. dxe4 f6 23. h4 Rxd1 24. Kxd1 f5 25. g5 hxg5 26. hxg5 Bc5 27. Ke2 Bd4 28. Kd3 Bxc3 29. bxc3 {Now I am a pawn ahead.  With my lack of endgame technique, there is no obvious win, but I guess that my best chances are on the Q side where I have a majority.} Kf7 30. a4 b5 {Putting the question to the pawn immediately.} 31. axb5 {I think this is a mistake because now my a-pawn is a passer.} cxb5 32. e5 a5 33. c4 {Another mistake.  If I play bxc4, it might be a draw because his K can clearly get to my a-pawn.} b4 {! But now he can't--I have two connected passed pawns.} 34. c5 Ke7 35. Kc4 Kd7 {And I have time to get to his c=pawn.} 36. Kd4 a4 {}
