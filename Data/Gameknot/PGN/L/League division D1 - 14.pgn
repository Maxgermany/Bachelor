[Opening "Evans gambit (C52), compromised defence"]

1. e4 {Evans Gambit. This is a tricky opening to play  - I've had mixed success. It's an aggressive opening  - white needs to establish a mating attack or win pieces before the endgame. Black's challenge is to try to get to the endgame with a pawn advantage.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {The gambit move} Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 6. d4 exd4 7. O-O Bb6 8. cxd4 d6 9. d5 Ne5 {This may not have been the best move - perhaps Nf6 is better?} 10. Nxe5 dxe5 11. Bb2 Qd6 12. Nd2 Nf6 13. h3 Ba5 14. Bd3 Bxd2 15. Qxd2 Nd7 16. f4 {Keeping an aggressive line} Qc5+ {this doesn't really help black - perhaps castling or Nb3 would be better} 17. Kh1 f6 18. a4 {Preventing black from castling (Ba3!)} exf4 19. Qxf4 Qd6 20. Qh4 {Can't afford to swap Qs - need to stay attacking. This moves sets up an interesting exchange on f6 later} Ne5 21. Be2 {again - don't want to swap pieces - need to stay attacking} Bd7 22. Bh5+ {this starts the real trouble for black. g6 creates problems, Nf7 is also trouble - so perhaps black did the best thing by moving the K} Kd8 {I can now see an interesting move - Rxf6. Just need to move the black Q away.} 23. Ba3 Qa6 24. d6 {....or block the Q from defending f6} cxd6 {I can't make the move yet - the K would escape to c7} 25. Rac1 Rc8 26. Rcd1 Qxa4 {?? this pawn swap is trouble for black} 27. Bxd6 Nc6 28. Rxf6 {and finally I can make the play - hard to see how black defends this now} Ne7 {black agreed.}
