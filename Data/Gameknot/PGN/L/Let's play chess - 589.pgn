[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C61), Bird's defence, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez, one of my favorite openings.} Nd4 {Bird's Defense, a playable but unusual variant.} 4. Nxd4 {I, of course, capture. I was expecting a response of PxN.} a6 {Very surprising. It does win back the piece, as I have two pieces attacked by Black Pawns, but it enables me to gain a Pawn in the process. I could also have won a Pawn by 5 BxP ch, as opposed to my actual line.} 5. Nf3 axb5 6. Nxe5 {I choose to win the KP instead of the QP.} Qe7 7. d4 d6 8. Nf3 {Technically, Black could now win back the pawn with 8..QxP ch, but he would be behind in development and his Q would be highly exposed.} Bg4 9. h3 Bxf3 {This exchange helps me, as I now secure my Pawn plus with the completion of it.} 10. Qxf3 Qd7 {Now my strategy will be to develop, secure my King and swap down, playing for the endgame. } 11. Bg5 {Since my Knight will have to go to Q2, I move the Bishop out first to avoid blocking it in.} f6 {Unnecessary, and impedes the development of Black's Knight.} 12. Be3 {Now both my advanced central Pawns are secure.} Qc6 13. c3 {Solidifying my position further.} Qc4 {Falling in love with the Q rather than developing the K-side pieces, although the position is closed enough that the advantage I gain in time will be difficult to turn to account.} 14. Nd2 {My development is now almost complete. I just need to connect my Rooks.} Qd3 {This move exposes the Q to danger and threatens nothing. 14...Q-B3 or 14..Q-K3 would be better.} 15. Qe2 {Being ahead one Pawn, I gladly offer the exchange of Queens.} Qxe2+ {My opponent accepts.} 16. Kxe2 {We've reached the endgame phase. I'm a Pawn up with better-developed pieces, a central space advantage, better Pawn structure and a centralized King. I'm feeling quite ebullient about my chances.} Ne7 17. g3 Ng6 18. b3 {I'm steadily pushing my Pawns forward. There's no hurry, since with the Queens gone Black can do little of consequence.} Be7 {This Bishop is severely restricted by its own Pawns.} 19. a4 {I offer a Pawn exchange to open the file and remove a pair of Rooks. Every simplification helps me now.} b6 20. axb5 {Okay, forget "exchange": I'll just win the Pawn outright.} Rxa1 21. Rxa1 {My opponent does me a favor. Now the game is simplified more, and I'm up two Pawns instead of one and control the only open file.} O-O 22. f4 {Slowly, but inexorably, my Pawns grind onward.} Nh8 {A maneuver to reposition the Knight, but Black's position will remain cramped.} 23. c4 Nf7 {Maneuver completed. It didn't help much.} 24. b4 {I'm aiming to create a passed Pawn.} c5 25. bxc5 dxc5 {I could create one here with P-Q5, but I see a possibility of more exchanging down.} 26. dxc5 Bxc5 27. Bxc5 bxc5 {Now I have a protected passed Pawn on QN5 and another set of pieces has come off.} 28. Nb3 {Pressuring Black's Q-side and tying down his remaining pieces.} Rc8 29. Rd1 Nd8 {Now if I play 30 R-Q5, 30...N-N2 defends the Pawn. } 30. Ke3 {I see that I cannot yet win the black QBP, which would give me two connected passed pawns and be decisive, so I elect to strengthen my position by centralizing and advancing my King.} Nb7 31. g4 {With Black tied down on the Q-side, I attempt to divert the defenders with a K-side demonstration.} g6 32. e5 Re8 {I get his Rook to move. However, as the move pins my KP, I have to be a little bit careful.} 33. Rd7 {Black's Rook is overburdened. He must now defend his Knight, but in the process he lets my KP become a second passed Pawn.} Rb8 {Forced, to avoid losing either the Knight or the QBP.} 34. e6 {Planning a classic maneuver.} Re8 35. e7 {With the Pawn now on K7, I have too many threats. I can now capture the Knight with my Rook and still keep the Pawn guarded. Black moves his Rook, enabling me to simplify the position to a winning endgame.} Ra8 36. Rd8+ {Black now has no choice. The Rooks come off the board.} Rxd8 37. exd8=Q+ Nxd8 38. Nxc5 {Now the two connected passed Pawns, which was the long-term goal I had been aiming at for many moves, will decide the issue.} Kf7 39. Ke4 Ke7 40. Na6 Kd7 41. Kd5 {With my King now in a supporting position, the Pawns can begin their advance.} Kc8 42. c5 Kd7 43. c6+ {This Pawn defends QN7 and the Knight guards QN8, allowing the QNP to sweep towards the finish line.} Ke7 44. b6 Ne6 {Black can only watch.} 45. b7 Nxf4+ {Delays coronation by a move.} 46. Ke4 h5 47. b8=Q {At long last.} h4 48. Qxf4 Ke6 {And Black resigns. A hard-fought game.}
