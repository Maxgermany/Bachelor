1. d4 {This is an interesting game that transposes to a Sicilian game. In this game I use a textbook way of neutralizing black;s queen side and then convert my enduring space advantage to a win. } c5 2. Nf3 cxd4 3. Nxd4 Nf6 4. Nc3 e5 5. Ndb5 d6 6. e4 a6 {It is necessary to drive away the advanced knight before proceeding with the rest of my development.} 7. Na3 {This is a bad square for a Knight. This highlights the drawbacks of the early Nb5. In my opinion I think white has better options than Nb5. } b5 {heems in the knight on A3. } 8. Nd5 {This is a dangerous move that allows black too much. Better is Be3 or Bg5} Nxe4 9. g3 {With the removal of the pawn on e4 the h1-a8 diagonal is open for business. I aim to make use of the open diagonal} Bb7 10. Bg2 Nc5 11. b4 {This is a good move. It kick the knight out the good c5 post and neutralizes blacks counter chances on the queen side. } Ncd7 12. O-O {wisking the king to safety.} Nc6 13. Be3 {This strenghtens my influence over the weak b3 square.} Rc8 14. Qd3 {This threatens c4 and Qf4. } g6 15. c4 {a decisive blow that leaves black crippled on the queen side. } a5 16. bxa5 bxc4 17. Nxc4 {White has a powerful passed pawn. } Nxa5 18. Ncb6 {Who let the dogs out...} Bxd5 19. Nxd5 Nc4 20. Rab1 Nxe3 21. fxe3 {opens the f file for the rook now f7 is weakness} Rb8 22. Rbc1 Nc5 23. Rxc5 {a scarifce that leads to a mating attack. } dxc5 24. Nf6+ Ke7 25. Qc4 Qd6 26. Ne4 {threatening Qxf7} Qe6 27. Qxc5+ Ke8 28. Nf6+ Qxf6 29. Bc6+ Kd8 30. Qa5+ Kc8 31. Rxf6 Bc5 32. Rxf7 Bxe3+ 33.
