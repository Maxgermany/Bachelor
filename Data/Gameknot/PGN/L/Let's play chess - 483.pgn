1. e4 d6 {Pirc Attack!     As noted it's actually a defence that focueses around the four black moves: d6 Nf6 g6 and usually Bg7, and on White's side d4 e4 (or in a different order) Nc3. White has a lot of options and kind of controls what will be the style of the game with the following moves (e.g. 4 f4, 4Nf3 4Be3 or 4 g3).  I'm trying to get into this with the book Pirc Alert by Albert and Chernin :)} 2. d4 {Natural reaction from White, occupying the centre} Nf6 {develops, attacks e4, most common move here in the Pirc I guess} 3. Nc3 {defends e4 the natural way} g6 {preparing to give the dark-squared bishop a home on the long diagonal} 4. Bc4 {uncommon variation?} Bg7 5. Qe2 {overdefending e4, developing the queen  As noted by Chesscentral there would have been the possibility of: 4 ... Sxe4 5 Sxe4 d4 :) thx for the comment} O-O {maybe developing to Nc6 was attractive here, which also guards the critical point e5?} 6. Nf3 {developing, preparing to king-side castle} Bg4 {pins the knight, attractive for a later Nc6xe4 threat} 7. e5 {cracking up the centre, preparing a deadly king attack ;-)} dxe5 8. dxe5 {up to this point the game is equal I guess, however the knight needs to find a new home...} Ne8 {? a bad decision, as the knight has no future here (only c7 which is not free yet). It would have been happier on h5, even it's on the dim.   Comment: My fear was that after Nd7 e6 woud follow. Of course fxe6 would yield Bxe6 Bxe6 Qxe6+. I did not feel that comfortable with that thought... Kh8 would have to follow since white could do Ng5! well... :) } 9. h3 {asks the bishop for a decision} Bxf3 {! kills the defender of e5 and weakens White's king side.} 10. gxf3 {?! interesting idea, White seems to plan queens-side castling and have an open g-file now.} Nc6 {develops, attacks e5. However, the poor knight on e8 is definitely entombed now for a while...} 11. f4 {fixes the pawn on e5} Kh8 {? for enabling f6, however it will soon be in a deadly bind...} 12. h4 {... prepared by this pawn storm.} f6 13. h5 {threatens the deadly hxg6} fxe5 {? gxh5 would have saved a bit longer I guess, however, after Qxh5 it's lost soon anyway} 14. hxg6 {threatens mate in one} exf4 {only move was Nf6, defending h7, however the game was already lost anyway} 15. Rxh7# {pretty!}
