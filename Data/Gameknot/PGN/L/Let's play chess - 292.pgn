1. f4 d5 {White camp is attacking on the King side. I answer by 1. ... d5, right in the center, because that is what is important in early game. } 2. h3 {2. h3? Playing Nf3 is better. h3 is totally a bet, because I can play Bg4 or Ng4, but not before a long time. More important, it loses time, and Black camp can attack by 2. c5! which controls the center. In this game, that's the plan.} c5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. a3 {4. a3? Same as 2. h3. It is a bet, and, my knight has nothing to do there. Its place is more in the center. } g6 5. g4 Bg7 6. a4 {6. a4 ? White are making a lot of mistakes. After 5. g5?! I thought that the would push against my castle and control f6, which would have forced my knight to go to e7, which is not really a good place.} Nf6 7. d3 O-O 8. e3 {8. g5! to continue the plan. Control the center is not the plan for White here. And their bishops don't play. Black definitely have the initiative.} Re8 {e3 is weak, and I need to open the game by e5, after playing 9. ... Qc7} 9. c3 Qc7 10. Bg2 e5 11. b3 {White have a great pawn structure here. But in fact, that does not serve their game: it definitely breaks their Knights and Bishops. 11. ... exf4 is very dangerous too.} exf4 12. Qe2 fxe3 {12. ... Rxe3 is not possible (even very tempting) because of the Bishop in c1.} 13. Bxe3 Qg3+ {Black want to gain something. As all the White pieces are on the King, it is time to attack.} 14. Kd1 d4 15. Qf2 Qxf2 16. Bxf2 {With the opening of the center, I prefer the exchange of the queens. Next step, continue to exchange and maybe win some material. } Nd5 17. Nfd2 Nxc3+ 18. Kc2 Nxb1 19. Raxb1 Be6 20. g5 Bf5 21. Bxc6 bxc6 22. Bg3 Re3 23. Bf4 Rxd3 {With a very dangerous rook in d3, the b column wide open, I concentrate my forces on the queen size where the white king hides. } 24. Kd1 f6 25. Kc1 fxg5 26. Bxg5 Be6 27. h4 Rb8 28. Kc2 {Looking to obtain the b pawn. 28. Kc2 remebered me that it is not a pawn, it is the king that I want. } Rc3+ 29. Kb2 d3 {29. ... d3 prepares Rc2. Bxb3 is interesting too, but the Bishops pair is too precious. } 30. Ka3 {Even better! I need just to play c4, and then, the white position is crushing itself. } c4 31. Ka2 cxb3+ {There is only one square where the king is safe. I did not found a checkmate for this continuation, but the advantage of the Black camp is too strong to do something great.   After 31. Kb2, we have: 31. Kb2 Rc2+ 32. Ka3 Bf8+ 33. Be7 Bxe7#  If they play 32. Ka1, 32. ... b2+ may give you everything white camp has. } 32. Ka3 b2+ 33. Nb3 Rbxb3+ 34. Ka2 Rb4# {Thanks for reading this annotation (sorry for the bad English, I'm french and it's late :)) and see you later for another analysis.}
