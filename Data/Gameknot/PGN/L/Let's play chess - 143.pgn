1. c4 b6 {I've been experimenting with this defense as it can be played against anything.  That's the plus side.  The downside is that sometimes the positions are too passive for my taste.} 2. d4 Bb7 {Better here might be e6 right away.} 3. Nc3 e6 4. e4 {White goes for the big center and will have an advantage in space.  Black has to try to knock it down.} Bb4 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. Qc2 Nc6 7. Nf3 d6 8. O-O Bxc3 {Black must take here when the pin is broken by castling--the Bishop can be trapped otherwise.} 9. Qxc3 Qe7 10. b4 e5 {This should blunt the activity of the light-square Bishop.} 11. d5 Nb8 12. a4 O-O 13. c5 bxc5 14. bxc5 Ba6 15. Bb5 {This hangs the e4 pawn.} Nxe4 16. Qa5 {This hangs the c4 pawn.} Nxc5 17. Rb1 Nb7 18. Qb4 Bxb5 19. Qxb5 Nc5 20. Be3 Nba6 21. Qc6 Rab8 22. Bxc5 Nxc5 23. Nd2 Rb6 24. Rxb6 axb6 {I'm not sure taking with the a pawn was best.  It's easier to liquidate pawns and create a passer by taking cxb6 maybe.} 25. Qb5 Qe8 26. Ra1 Qa8 27. Qc4 {Now there is no easy way for Black to make progress.  The c7 pawn is backward and very weak.} Rc8 28. Nb3 Nxb3 29. Qxb3 Qa5 30. Rc1 g6 31. g3 Qd2 32. Rd1 Qg5 33. h4 Qd8 {Black, although up two pawns, is very passive.  c7 has to be protected all the time.  I could maneuver for another 40 moves to try to realize a slight advantage or I could just offer my opponent a draw.} 34. Rc1 Qd7 {Draw offered and accepted.  }
