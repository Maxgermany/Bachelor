1. e4 {alrighty, So, this is Me after being kicked out of Southern Chess trying to build up my rating again. Dude probably doesn't know that I'm actually stronger than my rating shows.} g6 {I intended to get out one of the fancy schmancy modern openings out, so I began to ready the flanchetto.} 2. Qf3 {The 4-move opening again? pah!} Bg7 3. Bc4 {I wonder how many people actually fall for that...} e6 {That stops that.} 4. d3 c6 {intent to move ##. ... d5 eventually, forcing his bishop into a useless corner.} 5. Nh3 {This move always confuses me. Aren't knights supposed to be used near the middle, where they have the most manuverability?} d5 6. exd5 {And so it begins...} cxd5 {*clomp!*} 7. Bb5+ Bd7 8. Bxd7+ {If you can't tell, I forced that out of him... I contemplated 7. ... Nc6 8. ... a6 but I'm satisfied with the overall result.} Nxd7 9. O-O Ne7 10. Bg5 {I was SO waiting for that. With that, I can score 6 points at least! *in an unenthusiastic cheer* yaaaaay.} Bxb2 11. Nf4 {Y'know... wouldn't most people have moved the OTHER knight out of the way? for, like, avenging the rook?} Qa5 {I did that to:    Free up my knight from the psuedo-pin he was in.    Add a defender to the d5 pawn    Prepare to jack up his bishop (by moving up my pawn)} 12. Nxe6 {This baffels me... Why would he give up a knight for a pawn if it doesn't really get him an advantage} fxe6 {Meh, *recapture*} 13. Na3 {'bout time he moved the knight! Sheesh!} Bxa1 14. Rxa1 Qxa3 {... and that puts me 8 up!} 15. Re1 {This worried me slightly, but then I saw an opening that would blow him to shreds if he took that pawn...} Rc8 {this made that situation unstable for white. moving the rook away from the back row would cause it pain. MUCH pain.} 16. Qe3 {lining up for an e-file push?} Rc6 {the take-over had to be put on hold for e-pawn defense} 17. h4 {the next few moves on his part confuzzled me! @.@;;} Nc5 {extra e-pawn defense.} 18. h5 {... confuzzled me...} Qxa2 {free pawn! I guess I over looked that one...} 19. hxg6 {??? A better move woulda been h6, no? because...} hxg6 {It just relocked the h-file again for the white king...} 20. f4 Nf5 {like HECK I'm letting him do that again!} 21. Qe5 {oh, yeah... that whole queen thing... it was so useless through the game that I forgot about it.} O-O {That was to stop a rather annoying Qf6 move, which would've resulted in a checkmate for me or at the very least a loss of my pawn defense} 22. Bh6 {Qg7 maybe? Bf8? what was this guy thinking?!?} Rf7 23. Qb8+ {and he takes his pot-shot.} Kh7 {but his bishop is defenseless...} 24. Bg5 a6 {it took me the longest to figure out why he didn't take a pawn. Then I realized that they were both defended. I wanted to be able to move my queen, so that's why I bumped up this pawn.} 25. d4 {I was waiting for that. I knew it would happen eventually.} Nxd4 {and there's my responce. My defense, planned 5 moves ahead.} 26. Qe5 {did he think he would nab my knight?} Nxc2 {Ya-Ha!! I had just noticed that free pawn there...} 27. Rd1 Nb4 {I was planning on Nb-c4, forcinf his Queen away, then Qf2 } 28. Qe3 {Tricky Punk. He saw it coming and avoided it!} Ne4 29. Qh3+ {}
