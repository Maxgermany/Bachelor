1. d4 {I'm a 1. d4 player. Always have been. Lately, I've been studying the Queen's and Nimzo Indian systems - and I ran across this game. I've never heard of this Sashin fellow, but the name Korchnoi cetainly caught my eye. I have come of the opinion that the strong GM types consider the Queen's and Nimzo Indian systems a little slow and boring (and most often drawish), but if it's good enough for Korchnoi it's good enough for me. Or so I thought......This is a wild game. Sashin plays solidly, and delivers an extremely subtle, but beautiful 23rd move which starts the fireworks. Korchnoi gets through the opening in solid position, and then goes totally nuts with a brutal attack during the middlegame (at one point delivering 11 consecutive checks!) which marches the white king all the way across the board. Then, just like THAT! - all of his initiative is gone, and Sashin's awesome 23rd move gem tells the tale of victory. Was it brilliant insight into the position? or was it just dumb luck? I don't know....but this IS a pretty game! As always, my meager analysis will be limited. I hope you enjoy:)} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O {So far, standard Nimzo Indian play. White is most likely interested in kingside play, and black is looking to push on the queenside.} 5. Bd3 c5 {! A very natural move in this position, but I give it the "!" all the same - it hits the center, clears c6 for the Nb8, and loudly announces to white that Korchnoi is ready to fight!} 6. Nf3 d5 {Another natural move which, although it creates TONS of tactical possibilities, is very comfortable for black.} 7. O-O Nc6 {And the "status quo" is achieved by both sides. } 8. a3 {?! White forces black to make the first real commitment. The reason I give 8. a3 a "?!" is that although black's dark squared bishop is strong, it currently is only exerting influence on c3. Perhaps 8. Bd2 was better? It would develop and hit c3 as well.} cxd4 {!? Black aims for complications. It's about to get ugly.} 9. exd4 {White doesn't panic, and makes the correct re-capture. All of his defenses are still in play.} Bxc3 {Black forgoes the bishop pair and continues to disrupt the queenside.} 10. bxc3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 {And the smoke clears a bit. Both sides have roughly equal control of the center. White has the bishop pair and better developing space, but three pawn islands. Black is slightly weaker in development, but has good pawn structure and quicker access to the half open c and d files.} Qa5 {Forcing white to protect his backward c pawn.} 12. Bb2 e5 {Korchnoi maintains the initiative, and strives to further punish white's backward c pawn by trying to make it isolated via an exchange on e5.} 13. Re1 {Solid....prepares to own the e file while simultaneously threatening 14. dxe5.} Bg4 {Black develops his last piece with a nice little pin to boot.} 14. h3 {! White correctly assesses that black's light squared bishop is just too powerful to be freely roaming about on all of those empty light squares, and aims to remove it - which will further enhance the power of his bishop pair.} Bxf3 15. Qxf3 Rad8 {While down the bishop pair, black has maintained initiative and now brings his heavy pieces into the action with a solid threat on d4.} 16. Ba2 {As this bishop was unprotected, Shashin retreats it to safety while maintaining it's influence on f7.} Rd7 {Preparing to double up on the d file.} 17. Re2 {Preparing to double up on the e file.} Rfd8 18. Rae1 exd4 {Once again, black strives to maintain the initiative he has grown to love. He is solidly positioned to start mixing it up.} 19. cxd4 {Equalizing.} Qb6 {! That's four hits on d4! Korchnoi now threatens to win a pawn!} 20. Qc3 {I don't know what else could be played, as the threat of 20...Nxd4 with an ugly fork could not be tolerated.} Nxd4 {Black claims his prize!} 21. Re2e7 {Here is where it gets interesting. White has been pushed around for far too long, and delivers a threat of his own at f7. Black must eliminate this threat.} Rxe7 22. Rxe7 Nf5 {! And now for the REAL fight. White has a ton of ammo directed at black's king, and at f7 in particular. Black plays 22...Nf5 to attack the white Re7, but more importantly to clear the d file for his rook. } 23. Rxf7 {!! This move is so subtle, yet extroidinarily strong. White threatens 24. Rxb7  winning the black queen. This move ends up being white's saving grace at the end of the game.} Rd1+ {Of course, black sees the danger regarding his own monarch, but CONTINUES TO ATTACK! In this position, the board appears to be total offense by both sides. Defense? What is defense?} 24. Kh2 {White has been a step behind the whole game. If he can just hang on and weather the storm he will have a very explosive powerful counter punch. But can he hang on?????????} Qd6+ {?!?!?!?! This move just looks and feels so right, but according to Fritz loses the game for black! I won't bore you with a thousand lines of Fritz variations, just watch as it plays out:)} 25. g3 Ng4+ {! White can't take because 26. hxN is followed by 26...Qh6  27. Kg2 Qh1#.} 26. Kg2 Nh4+ {! Korchnoi continues to go all out by sacking a knight to strip away white's defenses.} 27. gxh4 Qh2+ 28. Kf3 {Forced.} Qxf2+ 29. Ke4 {A very ugly move, but it had to be made. If 29. KxN, then forced mate in 3....(29...Rg1  30. Kh5 g6  31. Kh6 Qxh#).} Qe2+ {Man, black MUST have a mate in here somewhere! This is the 7th check in a row!} 30. Kf4 {White is DYING for just ONE TEMPO!!!!!!!!!!!!!} Rf1+ {BRUTAL! Black is just hammering the white king! That's eight consecutive checks!} 31. Kg5 {Run, Forrest.....RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!} h6+ {Check number NINE!} 32. Kg6 {White is now hanging on by his fingernails! He has FOUR hits on the dismal g7 square but he just can't catch his breath to do anything about it.} Ne5+ {Black as well is hanging on for dear life! He must check or die! This move is not only a life saving check/knight sac, it also clears the file a rook check!} 33. Qxe5 {White snags the offending rook and maintains the heat on f7.} Rg1+ {WHY WON"T YOU DIE???????? Korchnoi delivers his 11th check.} 34. Qg5 {! WOW.  White sees the danger of 34. Kf5 which loses his rook. What a complicated position! My brain is hurting just trying to figure out both sides! Where is Ion when you need him?} Qxb2 {Supposedly, Korchnoi ran into some time trouble and made this last move rather quickly. I'm not sure that really mattered though. His brilliant attacking sequence just ran out of gas. While 34...QxB does remove some heat from g7, it just can't deal with..........} 35. Rxg7+ {.........! this gorgeous discovered/double check which is the dagger through the heart. Black resigned at this point, as 35...Kf8 loses to 36. Rg8# and 35...Kh8 loses to 36. Rh7#. What a truly wonderful game! I have gone back and played through it several times, and each time I am convinced that white is busted. I just know that Korchnoi has an irresistable attack. Then I just revel in Sashin's 23rd move and his dogged stubborness as he just waits for his chance to deliver his one and only shot at victory, and succeeds. Man, I love chess:) - Thomas}
