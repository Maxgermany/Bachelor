1. d4 e6 2. a3 {Not sure why white played this. It gives away a tempo.} g6 3. e4 d5 4. e5 Nc6 5. Nf3 Nge7 6. Bg5 Bg7 7. Nc3 O-O {This was probably premature. And possibly queenside would have been better. I already feel a bit cramped.} 8. Qd2 {Lining up with the bishop on g5.} a6 {Intended to keep white out of b5.} 9. Bd3 Qe8 {Freeing my knight.} 10. Bh6 Nf5 11. Bxf5 exf5 12. Qf4 Qe7 {? a very poorly thought out move. Accompishes nothing and gives away a pawn.} 13. Nxd5 Qe8 {Like I said Qe7 was a mistake.} 14. Nf6+ {Luckily my opponent hasn't his thinking cap on either and gives me a free knight. That pawn is pinned.} Bxf6 15. Bxf8 {Oops. guess it was me who wasn't thinking, again. At this point I started thinking. The board is opening up in the center. And I really would like to save that dark squared bishop. And I spot a way to do that. } Nxd4 {The immidiate threat here is Nxc2, forking king and rook. I was thinking he'd take the knight Nxd4 then Bxe5 forks knight and queen. Note that I had missed that Qe3 then would have made me loose material (2 pawns for a knight.) since I can't take the knight because I would have lost my queen. Actually here he can take my knight with his queen straight away. And I would have lost a knight for only one pawn. This is a really silly move. More to come.} 16. Kd1 {My opponent is no more awake than I am.} Ne6 {Trying to save face. Threatens his queen and delays the bishop exchange.} 17. Qh6 {Seems my opponent doesnt want the bishop exchange either. Maybe he is also thinking about having bishops in a fairly open game.} Bh8 18. Bb4 {Bishop trade averted. But badly. :-)} a5 {Go back from whence you came devil bishop.} 19. Bc3 {This makes the white pawn on e5 extra important. I need it to stay where it is. And keeping it there becomes a major headache. It also locks down my king since I cannot move that f7 pawn.} Bd7 20. a4 {this is a free pawn, but...} c5 {I need to keep his knight away from d4. I really don't want that pawn to move.} 21. Ke2 {I think this was just to link his rooks.} Bc6 {This is the proof. I hadn't spotted the fact that the a4 pawn is loose.} 22. Qe3 {Here I finally saw the free pawn, but now...} b6 {I needed to protect my own pawn. I had no Lightsquared bishop to fear.} 23. Rhd1 {Grabbing the opened file. Will prove important.} Bxa4 {Finally that pawn is mine.} 24. b3 Bb5+ 25. Ke1 {This position feels fairly ok. I just need to extract my bishop from h4 and activate my queen a bit, and I should have an almost equal game.} Qc6 {Activating my queen along the long diagonal.} 26. Rd6 {I didn't really understan this move since it doesnt make much difference.} Qb7 {Queen is still on her diagonal.} 27. Rad1 {doubling up the rooks. But my knight is already locked in place. this only pins it harder.} Bg7 {working the bishop out.} 28. Ng5 Bh6 {again I have to concetrate to keep my knight in place.} 29. h4 Qxg2 {This is a fairly brutal move. Forces white to set up a queen exchange.  Anything else is mate. (or serious material loss)} 30. Qg3 {he chooses g3 for the exchange.} Qxg3 31. fxg3 Bf8 {Here is another bad call on my part. I looked only at moves where his rook escapes along the d-file...} 32. Rxb6 {...and overlooked this.} Nd4 {?? This is where I lost all chances of a draw. For some dark reason I thought Bxd4 cxd4 Rxd4?? Bc5 forking his rooks. Off course...} 33. Bxd4 cxd4 34. Rxb5 {Rxb5.. Sometimes I just don't believe how truly blind one can be. But I liked this game. Very much because it had some very nice possibilities, and it flowed so nice. Mistakes were made on both sides, but the better player won in the end i think :-)} Bb4+ 35. Ke2 Re8 36. Nf3 f6 37. Rxd4 Bc3 38. Rdd5 Kf7 39. Kd3 {}
