1. c4 c5 2. e4 Qa5 3. Nc3 g6 4. a4 {I kind of like Pd3 better.} Qb4 {Ok, Nd5 looks really good.  Classic king/rook fork.} 5. Nf3 Bh6 6. d3 {I still like Nd5 better.  Can't now.} Bg7 7. Bg5 {What does black want to do?  BxN.  PxB.  QxP+.  White keeps the rook but is down a pawn and cannot castle. } Qxb2 {Free pawn.} 8. Nb5 {QxR, QxQ, BxQ, Nc7+, white gets the rook back.  Black defends against the white fork first with Na6.} Na6 9. Rb1 Qa2 10. Be2 d6 11. O-O Nb4 {Ok, white should fork the rook.  Nc7+} 12. Ra1 {No, BxR.} Qb2 {Black passes taking the rook?} 13. Rb1 {But so does white.  Nc7+ is still good.} Qa2 14. Ra1 {White offers black the rook again.} Qb2 15. Rb1 Qa2 16. Ra1 Qc2 {Black avoids three fold draw.} 17. Qe1 {Why?  Black can still nab the rook, though maybe still does not see it.} Qb2 {Yep.  Wrong again.} 18. Rb1 Nc2 19. Qd2 Qa2 20. Nh4 {Nc7+, for the sake of Pete!} f6 21. Bf4 {Nope.  Pg5 pawn forks the bishop and knight.  Nf5 does not help because BxN, PxB, PxBf4, QxP. } a6 {Ok, black wants to force white to take the rook.  Nice.} 22. Nc3 {No!} Qa3 23. Qxc2 {Well, the rook was worth more.  } b5 24. axb5 axb5 25. cxb5 {NxP is better.  Even RxP keeps white's pawns from being split, but NxP repositions the night for forking that rook.} Rb8 {Black also still has that pawn fork, Pg5.} 26. Rba1 Qb4 27. Rab1 Qa3 28. Nd5 Qa7 {Pb6 looks fun.} 29. b6 {Yay!} Qa3 {White is up a knight, but ought to move either the knight or bishop on the 4 rank.  Maybe Bg3.} 30. Nc7+ Kd8 31. Rba1 Qb4 32. Rab1 Qd4 33. Be3 Qe5 {Oh, Qa4!  } 34. d4 {Hey, not bad also.} cxd4 {Nf3 looks fun.} 35. Bd2 g5 36. Nf5 {That works too.} Bf8 37. Ba6 {Pressure builds.  Yay!} Bd7 {Time to push the pawn, maybe.} 38. Ba5 {Nothing protecting that bishop.  Qa2 might have been better.} Qxa5 39. Rba1 {No, now Pb6 is lost.} Qxb6 {Rfc1.} 40. Rfb1 {...too far.  The knight falls.} Qxc7 41. Qd3 e6 {Black dares white to NxPd3.} 42. Nxd4 e5 43. Nf3 Bg4 44. Rbc1 Qb6 45. Rcb1 Qc7 46. Rb7 {Rook and bishop for rook.  Not so good.} Rxb7 47. h3 Be6 {Uh, the rook is worth more.  Should have moved it instead.} 48. Rb1 {Black is ahead nine points.  Every trade now favors black.} Ra7 {Black should have taken the rook.} 49. Rb7 {This did not work last time.  White loses another rook.} Rxb7 50. Bxb7 Qxb7 51. Qa3 Qb1+ 52. Kh2 Qd1 {Be7 would help get that rook out.} 53. Qa8+ Bc8 54. Qa5+ Ke8 55. Qc7 Ne7 56. h4 {Bad idea.} h6 57. hxg5 {Worse idea.  Now the rook is open.} hxg5+ 58. Kg3 g4 59. Nh4 Qd3+ 60. Kh2 {Pf3 saves the knight, temporarily.  This is force mate.  RxN+, Kg1, Qd1#.}
