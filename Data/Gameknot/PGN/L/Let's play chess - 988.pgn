1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {so far so good ;) I almost always play this part with white.} d6 {bad move of black, it blocks his bishop on the black line. Nc6 would have been better.} 3. d4 {I don't mind getting more control in the center, therefore I push my pawn forward to d4.} Bg4 {ow how cute he attacks my knight.} 4. d5 {well I don't want to be forced to strike back with the g-pawn so I move my pawn to d5 to prevent it from being taken.} Bxf3 5. Qxf3 {well I didn't expect this trade so soon, but my queen is now active and I'll leave it standing here untill I find the need to move it again. It is in no danger of being attacked on the first 3 moves.} Nf6 6. Nc3 Na6 7. Bb5+ {hmmm his knight left the back squares leaving the field c6 undefended. I can win a pawn if black moves as I hope.} Nd7 {he didn't play c6 as I was hoping, but at least my queen got more movement freedom. I might save that movement for later.} 8. h4 {planning to play Bg5, but not certain if this is such a good idea.} Nb4 {strong move. black's knight is finally becoming active.} 9. Ba4 {I need to defend c2 but I don't want to move my queen away from the f-line.} b5 {black tries to lure me into Bxb5 after which he takes c2 with his knight and wins my rock.} 10. Nxb5 {thankfully my knight was also protecting b5.} Nc5 {after this move black never got a chance to avoid checkmate.} 11. Nxd6+ {check with both my knight and my bisschop so he has to move his king.} Ke7 12. Nf5+ {again check with my knight, his king is forced to move along.} Kf6 13. Nh6+ {and another check in the sequence leading to checkmate.} Ke7 {black probably thought that I would move my knight to f5 again.} 14. Qxf7+ {I took his pawn at f7 with check, black has only 1 move remaining: Kd6. after which I planned to move my knight to f5 with checkmate.}
