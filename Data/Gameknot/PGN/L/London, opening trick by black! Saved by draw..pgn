1. d4 {I save the game with a piece less than my opponent... nice tactics. } Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 3. Nf3 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {This is a mistake, as you will see...} e5 5. Bxe5 Qa5+ {Of course. I learned something here. } 6. Nc3 Qxe5 {I could have resigned, but come on, let's fight a little! Paul Morphy could do it... :-))))} 7. Qd3 a6 8. O-O-O Be7 9. g3 O-O 10. f4 Qc7 11. Bh3 {The obvious one was Bg2, but it didn't give me any attack. The game is lost, so I have to surprise my opponent. I am without any hope, of course. } Nc6 12. Nf5 Re8 13. e4 d6 14. a3 b5 15. b4 Bxf5 {A piece exchange was unavoidable, sooner or later. Now, he is completely saved if he does the simple g6, since I have no power on the black squares. } 16. Bxf5 Red8 17. Nd5 {Ok, I exchange one more piece, but something is getting into shape...} Nxd5 {I am sure he expects me to take back his knight, either with pawn or queen, and then play g6 and it's over. But I had another idea in mind. } 18. Bxh7+ Kf8 19. exd5 Nb8 {He has to take back the knight! Now, it looks a little more fun for me, I am not ok, but at least it is some fun. He, of course, wants to trap my bishop with g6, and expects my bishop to retire. } 20. Qf5 Bf6 {Now my bishop is really trapped, but look...} 21. g4 Qc3 {I know. But there is no point in defending, I will lose sooner or later, so go on with the "banzai attack". I analyzed that I had a chance to survive to the subsequent checks, losing a lot of pawns, but maybe I have still "something" up there. } 22. g5 {Now, if black plays g6 I recover my piece, with an inferior position. } Qxa3+ 23. Kd2 Qxb4+ 24. Ke2 Bc3 {Black wants to free his bishop, but it would have been more advisable to get the rook into the game inmediately with e8 , or to place the bishop in d4, restricting my king's possilbe moves.} 25. Bg6 {As if nothing was happening! Of course, if f6, it follows Qe6, and black has to defend a mate with Ra7, then I am resourceless. } Rd7 26. Bxf7 {He couldn't expect that me, with only a queen attacking, and a piece less, will be so crazy as to sacrifice!} Rxf7 27. Qc8+ {Oh-oh. This is the interesting position. Now, Ke7, Qe6  can lead to drawn.  Ok, should black try to avoid drawn, by playing Kd8? This is the interesting part. White must take the rook in f7, and then it's black turn to go: Qe4 , Kf2 (forced, otherwise I lose a rook or more), Bd4  (if Qxc2  it leads more or less to the same, but with less danger for white - I think). White can release the danger with RxB, but it is not necessary, believe me: Kg3, Qe3 , Kh4! (it seems bad, but it is the good one. If Kg4, Qe2 , Kf4 - forced - and, via c2, the black queen goes to c8 and it leads to mate. Try if you don't believe me)  Kh4, ok, then the only way for black to go on is Qf2 , Kh5. Now, black can try to defend or go on with the checks. Anyway, the material is equal, and white reached his objective, to be back in the game.  Let's go a little further, it is fun: black goes Qe2 . Again, Kg6 is forced, otherwise is checkmate. Qxc2  and white goes f5! Now, black has to care for the bishop AND for the checks that can give the white queen... drawn is assured for white (for example: Be5, Qf8 , and the black king cannot escape to the c column because of the white rook in c1. If Qb2, instead of moving the bishop, Rh-c1 is even more dangerous for black. If Ra7 instead, Qg8 , Kd7, Qe6 , Kd8 and Qxd6  is really bad for black...)  Must WHITE try to take advantage before all this? No. Observe that after 27. ... Ke7, Qb7  wins a rook, but loses the game.   So, apparently black must either stay with drawn, or face the loss of the f7 rook and get into a check labyrinth without being sure to get out of it...   } Ke7 28. Qe6+ Kf8 29. Qc8+ Ke7 30. Qe6+ Kf8 31. Qc8+ {}
