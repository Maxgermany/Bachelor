[White "Robert James Fischer "]
[Black "Mikhail Tal "]
[Opening "French (C17), Winawer, advance, 5.a3"]

1. e4 {Fischer and Tal played eleven games against each other. Tal won four, Fischer two, and five games were drawn.} e6 {Tal plays the French Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence} 2. d4 {In this game Fischer plays the main line.} d5 {As does Tal.} 3. Nc3 {This is the most common move although the Tarrasch Variation: 3.Nd2, Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 exd5 and Advance Variation: 3.e5 are all quite playable.} Bb4 {And this is the Winawer Variation. As White Nc3 is now pinned, black is threatening to take on e4.} 4. e5 {So Fischer deals with that threat.} c5 {Further attacking the white centre.} 5. a3 {White hits the bishop.} Ba5 {This is slightly unusual. Exchanging on c3 is more usually played. This is called the Armenian Variation, as its theory and practice have been much enriched by players from that country, the most notable of whom is Rafael Vaganian. Black maintains the pin on the knight.} 6. b4 {This is the most commonly played reply. In some variations white sacrifices a pawn in return for the attack.} cxd4 {Tal takes this way. Also playable is 6...cxb4 7. Nb5 Nc6 8. Nf3 a6 9. Nd6+ Kf8 10. Bd3 b3+ 11. Kf1 Bc7.} 7. Qg4 {Fischer hits g7. If white had an extra move he could take on g7 and then on h8.} Ne7 {Tal sacrifices a pawn for development and the open g file.} 8. bxa5 {Fischer takes the bishop. In the French Defence, often the position in closed, with long interlocking pawn chains, and knights are better than bishops, but in this case the position is opening and the white bishops are better than the black knights.} dxc3 {Tal takes the offered knight.} 9. Qxg7 {Fischer regains the pawn, hitting the rook on h8.} Rg8 {The rook counter-attacks.} 10. Qxh7 {Another pawn goes.} Nbc6 {Theory says White stands better on 10...Nd7 11. Nf3 Nf8 12. Qd3 Qxa5 13. h4! (Smyslov-Botvinnik, 9th match game 1954.) } 11. Nf3 {White protects e5.} Qc7 {There's nothing wrong with 11...Qxa5 12. Rb1 Qc7 13. Bf4 Bd7 14. Bg3 O-O-O (Damjanovich-Udovcich, Yugoslavia 1963). Qc7 is also fine, attacking e5 for a second time.} 12. Bb5 {Developing the Bf1 at last, and indirectly protecting e5 by pinning the Nc6.} Bd7 {White's h-pawn heads for a touchdown on h8 after 12...Rxg2 13. Kf1! Rg8 14. Rg1! Rxg1+ 15. Kxg1.} 13. O-O {White finally castles.} O-O-O {And so does black. The position is most imbalanced, with the kings castled on opposite sides - and both sides have open files in direction of each other's king. An exciting middle game is in prospect!} 14. Bg5 {Underestimating Black's reply. Fischer claims he missed a win with 14. Bxc6! Bxc6 15. Qxf7 d4 16. Qxe6+ Bd7 17. Qxe7 Rxg2+ 18. Kxg2 Bh3+ 19. Kxh3 Qxe7 20. Bg5 with a decisive material advantage as soon as White can consolidate. } Nxe5 {Black recaptures the pawn he was down.} 15. Nxe5 {White takes.} Bxb5 {Instead of recapturing the knight on e5, Tal cleverly recaptures on b5 instead, threatening the Rf1.} 16. Nxf7 {This leads to an exciting draw. White could maintain some tension with 16. Bxe7 Qxe7 17. Rfe1. } Bxf1 {So the rook goes.} 17. Nxd8 {And does a black rook.} Rxg5 {Now a white bishop.} 18. Nxe6 {But now white forks queen and rook.} Rxg2+ {But black has this check.} 19. Kh1 {But not the hasty 19. Kxf1? Rxh2 20. Qf7 Rh1+ 21. Kg2 Qh2+ 22. Kf3 Qh3+ and wins. } Qe5 {Black's queen was attacked, so it had to be moved.} 20. Rxf1 {And now the black bishop goes.} Qxe6 {And so does the white knight.} 21. Kxg2 {And the other black rook.} Qg4+ {In view of his material deficit Black must take the perpetual check after 22. Kh1 Qf3+ etc.  Thank you for reading this annotation, please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system to let me know how I am doing! Until next time dear reader!}
