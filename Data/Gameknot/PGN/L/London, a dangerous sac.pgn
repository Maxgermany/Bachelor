1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. h3 e6 5. g4 Be4 6. Nbd2 Bd6 7. Nxe4 {A dangerous move. I expected BxB, with advantage by black. } dxe4 {Not BxB, because cxd6 conquers the center and deprives my knight of a good escape route. } 8. Ne5 Nfd7 9. e3 O-O {Passive, but not bad. I expected f6, with a slight advantage by black. } 10. g5 {A typical London set. Early advance of the kingside pawns to concentrate the game on the black's castling. } Nxe5 11. dxe5 {As always, an unexpected move. My dsb is self.trapped, but it holds a cramped position for black. } Be7 12. h4 Nd7 13. Qd4 {Also interesting Qg4. It's a boring fight for the pawn, now...} Nc5 {I thought b4, but then there is a solid attack from black on the black diagonal, after Na5, QXe4, c3, and the black queen can go to a5... } 14. O-O-O {Dangerous, but the key of the position is to have the kingside free for the rooks, in sight of a pawnstorm.} a5 {Preventing b4, I won't play anyway.} 15. Bg2 {...and the pawn is won, but I will exchange my best bishop. Hmmm...} Qc8 {QxQ would have been bad for black, but... this one... well, maybe...} 16. Qc4 {I am not in a hurry to take the pawn. It is better to prevent b5, that can gives black some countergame. } c6 {Now, c6 is not so important, because the queen is far from the black diagonal.  Black expects me to take the pawn, exchange the bishop and play b5.  I decided that the game would have been really boring this way, and I launched a challenge. } 17. Rd6 {!? I am crazy, no doubt. } Bxd6 18. exd6 {And black takes the bite. Now, my only advantage is positional. It won't be clear in few moves. } Na6 {I bet black now would have played b6 instead... and he would have been right. } 19. Bxe4 {Now my bishops are mortal weapons.} Qd7 {Maybe g6 was better, just to prevent what follows, but if so, h5, inmediately. } 20. Qd3 {Threat on h7. Nothing special. } g6 21. Qd4 {Threating Be5, Bh8. Nothing special. } f5 {Big mistake, but what else?} 22. gxf6 e.p. Nb4 {It looks good, but black should have thought about defending, instead. But the danger isn't so clear, yet. } 23. h5 {Threats to open the files. } Qf7 24. hxg6 hxg6 {Now, Bh6, Rd8, Bg7 looks ok. But not enough.  I set conditional moves, here, but I was wrong. } 25. Bxg6 Qxg6 26. f7+ {I simply didn't see the following move. Incredible. I thought that after Q or R x pawn, it would have been mate. No way. } Kxf7 {I started to sweat. Was I wrong? Black has a dangerous threat on the first row. Not to speak about Qxc2#.} 27. e4 Ke8 {Who cares about the bishop? :-)} 28. Rh6 {Who cares about Qg1+? Or Nxa2+?} Qf7 {He correctly saw that the checks would have lead to nothing, but my quick win. So he defended.  Now, QxB+ is something I cannot allow. So it's my turn to defend. } 29. Bg5 {Who cares about Qxf2? Of course he cannot do it. } Kd7 {The normal answer, e5, is just holds the position for white. It is not bad, but I wanted to make him worry. He didn't bring his other rook into the game. } 30. f4 {Also possible Be7, but with the result to allow his f8 rook to bothe mine with Rh8. So I played this aggressive move.  No inmediate threat now, though. Qb6 at once is not enough to win. Once again, I have to stop my attack in order to defend. But you'll see what a nice pawn is this... :-)} Nxa2+ {Mistake. But he thinks about the trap: if my king takes the knight, e5+ will make him win the game. } 31. Kb1 {I have no intention to take the knight, but you have to be sadistic at chess :-D} Nb4 {So, another defending tempo is lost for black! I've been very lucky. } 32. Qb6 {What? I give away my very strong pawn in d6?} Kxd6 {There is a reason. Now, e5 is pinned!} 33. f5 {Yummy!} Rfe8 {It would have been better to move the other rook. } 34. Bf4+ {The f pawn move had another nice consecuence: the bishop is now free to take part in the attack again. } Ke7 {Oh oh, b7 is lost. But, as correctly seen by black, to take it is not enough.  Rxe6 looks natural, but it is not the best. Can you find out the best one?} 35. f6+ {Qc5+ was not bad, but this one is too nice. Of course. I am sure I will win, and I am still -5! The sac was in move 17, and we are in move 35. A personal record.  Of course, had black played well, I would have lost. My sac wan't "correct".  But it was in this game. } Qxf6 {Can you guess what, don't you...} 36. Qxb7+ {I'm sorry to be proud. This would be my last good game on GK, I am retiring. So I can allow indulgence to myself. }
