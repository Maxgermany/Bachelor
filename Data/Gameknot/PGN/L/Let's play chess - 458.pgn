1. d4 {.} e6 2. e4 c5 {Lets try to transpose to a Sicilian} 3. Nf3 {dxc6 is I think better, but rare} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Be3 {This Bd3 and Be3 set-up is not common...} d5 {so let's challange the center exd5 Nxd5 and white's position is structural miserable} 7. Nxc6 {?! exchanging knights on c6 is worst for white as my pawn centre will became overwhelming} bxc6 8. Bg5 h6 {forces defenition} 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 {threatens the Rook on a1} 10. Nc3 d4 {gaining space and two pawns on account of white's misplacements} 11. Ne2 {needed as both Nb1 pr Na4 are worst} Bb4+ 12. c3 dxc3 13. O-O {forced} cxb2 {now this pawn will be a central strategic focal point, as white's need to defend it will cramp their pieces} 14. Rb1 {tying the rook to the defence of the promotion threat} Bd6 {two ideas here h2 and Be5 controlling the long diagonal} 15. f4 {! to support e5, but even the black has Bc5+ to remove from the threat with tempo, I only need to be careful after Kh1} Rb8 {better than Ba3 were it can be contested by Qa4 double attack on c6 and Ba3} 16. e5 {expected but inconsequent} Bc5+ {the open g1-a7 diagonal gives me an escape route removing the bishop from the fork with tempo...} 17. Kh1 {maybe better was 16.Kh1 to set black a trap and then 17.e5 } Qe7 {... to remove also the queen} 18. Qa4 O-O {Setting a trap as Qxc6 leads to Bb7 aimed against g2, and b2 is tactically protected} 19. Rfd1 Rd8 20. Qxc6 {?? the sacrifice of the pawn is beneficial to black as the h1-a8 diagonal is now open} Bb7 {and both my bishops are now aimed against the opponents king} 21. Qa4 Qh4 {bringing the queen to the fight near white's king} 22. Qc2 Qf2 {the threat is Qxg2++} 23. Rdg1 {only move} Qe3 {tying the knight to the defence of f4} 24. Rgd1 {I need to have caution against some tactics such as 1.Rxb2 Rxb2 2.Bh7+ ... 3.Rxd8 wining the b pawn, but I will play Bf3 as for now the threat Qf2-Qxg2++ is sufficient to prevent it} Bf3 {a new trap gxf3 Qxf3++, and the threat Bxe2 to Qxf4} 25. Rxb2 {expected, as mentioned before} Rxb2 {conscientiously leaving the back rank week to deflect the d rook} 26. Bh7+ Kf8 {only move Kh8 is mate after Rxd8++, now if Rxd8+ Ke7 leaves three white pieces en prise the queen the knight and the rook } 27. Rxd8+ Ke7 28. Qa4 {White's threat of Qd7++ lacks one tempo} Qg1+ {a nice sacrifice, to finish, to deflect the knight from the 2nd rank and achieve Bxg2++ a smothered mate with a bishop!} 29. Nxg1 Bxg2# {A nice finish to a nice game, during the game some inaccuracies from white allowed black to achieve a two pawn advantage and create a strong passed pawn, that focalized white's defensive efforts, and abled black to develop an attack on the king.  }
