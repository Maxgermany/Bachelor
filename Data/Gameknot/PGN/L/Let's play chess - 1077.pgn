1. d4 {This is my first try to annotate a game.  So, if my analysis is bad, you can cop it up to little experience.  But I'll try my best.  ;)} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 c6 4. Bd3 g6 {Not the most common line in this position, but not unheard of.  Black chooses to play a Grunfeld like structure, but he's played d5 first.  White has played the opening with several commitments.  By playing a Colle like structure, he's blocked in his dark squared bishop.  White likes to bring the bishop out to f4 or g5 BEFORE playing e3 when Black declares early intentions to play an Indian with Nf6 and g6.} 5. Nbd2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 {Perhaps too passive.  It does strenthen the d4 pawn, but why not go for e4 right away?} Bg4 8. h3 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 {Nxf3 was better.  White intends to get his e4 break, the main idea of the Colle, but black has a refutation here that challenges this.} Nbd7 10. e4 {It looks like white has quickly declared war and the open lines will be in his favour, but....} e5 {Black gets his e5 break in!  If white had played Nxf3 instead of Qxf3, such a problem would not be there.} 11. Re1 {White is likely to end up with an isolated pawn, so he tries to get the e-file.  After exd4, cxd4, dxe4, Nxe4, Nxe4 and Rxe4, white has an isolated pawn, but he has plenty of open lines to use, plus the two bishops.  After completing development with Bf4 and Rd1, white has good chances.  The same position will arise after dxe4.} Re8 12. exd5 Nxd5 {If after cxd5, white should probably continue with Nb3, defending his d pawn, leading to a similar position as seen in the game.} 13. Nb3 exd4 14. Rxe8+ Qxe8 15. cxd4 Qe1+ 16. Bf1 Re8 17. Bd2 Qe7 18. Re1 {White wishes to force black's queen away. } Qd8 19. Rxe8+ {Only move.  Anything else would surrender the e-file without a fight.} Qxe8 20. Qe2 {Probably the only move.  With the isolated pawn, endgames are almost always unfavourable for the side possessing one, but black's control of the e-file with his queen gives him good chances.  White's pieces are controlling the penetration squares on the e-file, but they are unfortunately passive.  Take a look at the f1 and d2 bishops!  White is practically wasting his bishop pair.} Qxe2 21. Bxe2 f5 22. Bf3 Nd5f6 {Not the best.  Why not N7f6?  The two knights are working in harmony and are firmly blockading the d-pawn.  } 23. Nc5 {Not the best move.  Na5! would have decided things immediately since black can't defend his pawns.} Nxc5 24. dxc5 Nd5 25. b3 Bd4 26. Bxd5+ cxd5 27. Be3 Bxe3 28. fxe3 {Time to evaluate this endgame.  It's quite complex, actually.  Both sides have isolated pawns.  The kings are preparing to advance to the center.  Black has a pawn majority on the kingside, while white has one on the queenside.  The queenside majority gives white dangerous chances, though.  The majority has a lust to quickly expand with b4 and a4, with moves like b5 and then c6 coming in, probably creating a strong passed pawn.  This may not happen, but it is a threat.  It at least keeps the black king somewhat tied down to this area to prevent a passed pawn from becoming a deadly threat.} Kf7 29. Kf2 Ke6 30. Ke2 {Kf3 looks better, but it is not.  Kf3 leads to no better chances for white.  He can't advance further after Ke5.  Hence, Ke2, getting a more active position on the queenside with Kd3.  This stops black from playing something like Ke5, with d4 and Kxd4, getting the king close on the queenside.  White is pinning his chances to the queenside, so it is best to prevent black from getting to that side.  } Ke5 31. Kd3 f4 {A losing blunder.  This takes the black king far too far away from the queenside.} 32. exf4+ Kxf4 33. Kd4 {Now, the black king can't get to the queenside.  His idea of Kg3, Kxg2, Kxh3 and then advancing his g-pawn is far too slow.  White simply plays b4, along with b5 and c6, forcing a passed pawn.  If black's g-pawn was more advanced, things might have been different.} Kg3 34. b4 a6 35. a4 {}
