1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {Grunfeld Defense} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. e3 {I personally think that 4.Nf3 and 5.e3 are a mistake. White may play 4. e3 and 5. Ne2, because in this position the Bishop can't attack  the white in g4 (6. f3).} Bg4 6. Be2 O-O 7. O-O Re8 8. Ne5 Bxe2 9. Qxe2 Nbd7 10. Nxd7 Qxd7 11. Re1 c6 12. c5 {This is a mistake. White must remove the pawn in d5} e5 13. e4 Nxe4 {Black gains a pawn. In case of 14. Nxe4 black have to play exd4, attacking the Knight in e4} 14. Nxe4 exd4 15. Qd3 Qf5 16. Nf6+ Bxf6 17. Qxf5 Rxe1# {}
