1. d4 d5 2. b3 Nf6 3. Bb2 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. e3 {This is an opening setup I have been experimenting with.} Bg4 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nbd2 Nc6 8. a3 {a3 usually turns out to be important to prevent a B or N from landing on b4.} Re8 9. O-O e5 {A good pawn break by my opponent.} 10. dxe5 Nxe5 {My opponent exploits the pinned N on f3.} 11. Be2 Bxf3 12. Nxf3 Qd6 {This may be a mistake--it loses the exchange.} 13. Nxe5 Rxe5 14. Bxe5 Qxe5 15. Qd4 Qd6 16. Qb4 {I'm not sure if this was best.} Qc6 17. Rac1 a5 18. Qd2 {Maybe not best because it allows my opponent to gain a tempo and centralize his N.} Ne4 19. Qd3 Rd8 20. c4 {Attacking the pinned pawn on d5.} Nc5 21. Qb1 d4 22. Bf3 Qf6 23. exd4 Qxd4 {This capture is a problem because of the undefended R on d8.} 24. Rcd1 Qc3 25. Rxd8+ {Black is in serious difficulty here and down a lot of material.} Bf8 26. Rc1 Qf6 27. Rcd1 {Although Black could carry on, it would be difficult to even draw this game down so much material.}
