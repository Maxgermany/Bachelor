1. e4 {Hello everyone welcome to new annotation this is a short game.But i hope it helps someone and possibly help me.Okay here we go.He opens with e4} e5 {Standard answer by me e5} 2. Qh5 {WAY to early to bring out the Queen.} Nf6 {Nf6 to put pressure on early queen and e4} 3. Qxe5+ {This move does gain pawn and does put me in check but with so little development it is uneffectual} Be7 {Block check} 4. Bc4 {I believe he trying to develop and put pressure on kingside.Not sure??????} Nc6 {Pressure on Qe5} 5. Qg3 {RETREAT} O-O {Standard castle} 6. Bd3 {Negative move i believe continuing to stunt development} Bc5 {More development} 7. Nf3 d6 {RELEASING Qd8 and Bc8} 8. e5 {Here i believe e5 is used as bait so i will lose N if i went Nxe6 therefore destroying my center .Because i believe he would have went Qxe5 thus forcing move of Nf6 so i just went d6xe5} dxe5 {take pawm} 9. Ng5 {Now i see his plan?I think now he is trying to move in on my kingside} Be6 {Bliuding up kingside} 10. Qh4 {HERE WE GO} Qd4 {Alittle dangerous but thinking trade} 11. Bxh7+ {Iwas wrong about trade or he was focusing in on one part of board i unfornately have done this lost games as result} Kh8 {He should have took queen next.h7 was cover by his knight and mine,but he would have sacked his queen} 12. Bg6+ {This always happens when you forget about "rifle" in longshot and you charge in without looking around} Qxh4 {After this move opponent resigns i  was about to take Bg6 or Ng5.I hope you enjoyed.postive input taken negative tolerated GOOD CHESS GOOD DAY!!!}
