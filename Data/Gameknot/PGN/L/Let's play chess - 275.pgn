1. e4 {This time I will annotate a lost game of mine! Will try to analyze what it was that gone wrong! I heard that Bobby Fischer once published a book about 50 games that he had lost. The name of the book was, if I remember it right: " 50 bad games". } c5 2. Nf3 d6 {Sicilian Opening.} 3. d4 cxd4 {Theory so far.} 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 {I nowadays avoid this type of move! Makes a nasty hole in my pawn structure on e6. But this game I played two years ago and then I obviously believed it was a decent move. } 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3 {f3 looks a little bit unsound for me? Better was maybe Be2 or Bd3?} Be7 9. Qd2 Nc6 10. O-O-O {0-0-0! Now f3 looks like a perfectly fine move, preparing a pawn push against Black`s King!} O-O 11. g4 {The natural follow-up move after f3. Starting a pawn push against Black´s King side.} b5 12. Nd5 Ne8 13. h4 {The logical continuation. A pawn push against Blacks King side. } Bxh4 {A free pawn or maybe some kind of clever trap?} 14. g5 Bg3 15. Qg2 Bf4 16. Nxf4 exf4 17. Qh2 {Instead of taking back the pawn immediately, White threatens checkmate on h7. Black must defend against this threat in the next move!} f6 18. Qxh7+ {Getting the pawn back with tempo and also ruins Blacks King camp.} Kf7 19. g6+ Ke7 {I tried to escape with my King.} 20. Bxf4 {Now is White one pawn up and have also destroyed the defense around Black´s King!} Rg8 21. Qh2 {Ties up Blacks pieces in the defense of the d6-pawn. Black´s position have become a little bit cramped.} Bxb3 {Not good of me. The light-squared Bishop has more utlity in the defense of my King. Makes my white squares weak, because Black has still his light-square Bishop left.} 22. cxb3 Ne5 23. Bxe5 fxe5 24. Qd2 Rc8+ 25. Kb1 Nf6 26. Bh3 Rc6 27. Rdc1 Rxc1+ 28. Rxc1 {Some exchanges have occured! White is clearly better positionally!} Nd7 29. Qg5+ Ke8 30. Qf5 {Threatens checkmate at f7. Black resigned, can´t defend properly against this threat. If Black tries ...Qe7, then Rc8+ must lead to ...Qd8 (only move) and then it´s still checkmate on f7 with the White Queen!} Qe7 {Analyze!!!} 31. Rc8+ Qd8 32. Qf7# {}
