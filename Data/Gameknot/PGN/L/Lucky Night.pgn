1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 Bd6 4. Bg3 Bxg3 5. hxg3 {I feel confortable with this. My lsb is better than his.} Nf6 6. Qd2 {? I overlooked Nd5 at once.} Nc6 {He helped a lot. But let's see...} 7. Qg5 {Threatening a poisoned pawn.} Rg8 {Castling rights lost.} 8. Nbd2 {? My Q is awakwardly placed, ready for a trap.} Bd7 {Spared.} 9. e3 {? I bet he can't trap it.} h6 10. Qh4 Qe7 {If g5, Qxh6.} 11. g4 {...providing my Q for a more active square and a refuge, just in case. Also controlling this Kside.} O-O-O {Yes. My target is there. How can I get to it? Not easy! I would have gone for Qb4 at once!} 12. c3 Rgh8 13. Qg3 Kb8 14. Bd3 Rde8 {He plans to liberate his position by playing e5. I can't allow it.} 15. Ne5 Ne4 {Sacs a pawn. If NxN, dxN.} 16. Bxe4 {I liked a N more than a B there. } dxe4 17. Nxe4 {Here, looking at Nc5.} Nxe5 {Ok, how to retake? } 18. dxe5 {Probably a mistake, but I didn't like the Q's hunt after Qxe4.} Bb5 {Clever, now I can't castle. I can't move my c pawn, or Qb4+.} 19. O-O-O {...with all my... priers.} Red8 20. Nd2 {Defening without exchanging or moving pawns. Be3 looks scary, but there is no inmediate threat.} Qg5 {? Thank you black!} 21. f4 Qe7 22. Nb3 {The idea is Nd4. It can be kicked by the c pawn, though. No, no c4.} Ba4 23. Qf3 {Maybe was too easy: I threat Na5...} Bxb3 24. axb3 {Now I am a pawn up, with more space. } Qc5 25. Kc2 Rd5 26. Rd4 c6 27. g5 Qb5 {?? c4 is a valid fork! I thought it was impossible, I just thought about subtle manouvers on the K side... :-)} 28. gxh6 gxh6 29. Rh3 {...with the idea to play Rg3-Rg7... after the move, realizing the fork...} Rxd4 30. exd4 {Now my Q is dued to the defence of e2 and f1.} Kc7 31. Rg3 Rh7 32. Rg8 a5 33. f5 {This was my plan. My Q wil leave his post, but only when it would be too late... (or so I thought!)} exf5 34. Qxf5 {...and Rh7 is lost. Can you believe I didn't take it? But let's see why!} Qe2+ 35. Kb1 Qd1+ 36. Ka2 {I though I was shielded, but...} a4 {! Very clever! He will force a draw or a Q's exchange, saving the R! How can I save from a drawn?} 37. Qc8+ Kb6 38. Qd8+ Kb5 39. c4+ Ka6 40. Qa8+ Kb6 41. c5+ Kb5 42. Qxa4# {A good, nice, old-style mate net! :-)}
