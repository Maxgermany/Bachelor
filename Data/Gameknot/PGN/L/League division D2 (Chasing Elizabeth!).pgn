1. e4 {The old lady is going to need some oxygen after this affair.  This ends in a nice bishop sacrifice, enabling my queen to make her presence felt in the kings backside. :)} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 {Here's where the chase for her royal highness begins. } Qd6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. d4 Nc6 6. Bb5 Bd7 {He just trapped his queen with that move, time to set up an attack.} 7. O-O a6 8. Bc4 Ng4 9. Ne4 {subtle, but if you notice only has 2 spaces she can go!! b4, which sucks, and g6 not much better! } Qg6 10. Bd3 Qh5 {moves to avoid being discovered, and a chance on h2} 11. Ng3 {royal steed forcing another 2 square option for the queen, she can now only go to d5 or a5,  I like chasing her.} Qd5 12. c4 Qd6 13. Nf5 Bxf5 {He decided it was time to end this charade.  But it's already too late, it's 13 moves into the game and he's spent 3/4's of it running his queen around. } 14. Bxf5 Nf6 15. Ng5 Nd8 16. g3 e6 17. Bf4 {blatant attack on she-woman.} Qb4 18. Re1 {sealing the deal on the e6 pawn.} Qxc4 {here I believe he senses an exchange, so Queenie guards e6 as well} 19. Rc1 {This move is multi-purpose, it rids the queen of the central area, and gains my rook access to the C file (which comes in quite handy later)} Qxa2 20. Qc2 {Another multi purpose move.  Attacking c7 and H7, but he's not suspecting h7 I'm sure.} Bd6 {i was right, immediate threat is c7} 21. Bxd6 {I take to control the c file} cxd6 22. Bxh7 g6 {He traps, in retrospect I think he should've taken with the N} 23. Bxg6 {begging for him to take my bishop} fxg6 24. Qxg6+ {now he's in a hurt lock, and there's no escape } Kd7 25. Qg7+ {He can't move onto the C file because of my trusty rook on c1} Nf7 26. Qxf7+ Kd8 {forced this move} 27. Nxe6+ {He resigns here, his next option, by force, was Qxe6.  Followed by my QxQ. Then it's just a matter of a couple moves. #}
