1. e4 c5 {[All criticism is welcomed. If there is something I missed or did wrong, let me know!] Cicilian Defence.} 2. Bc4 e6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. b3 d5 {White employs Bowlder Attack. I respond accordingly with e6, then later d5, clearing the center and giving me a tempo. Bc6 is played before d5 to keep the king from being exposed to Bb5+.} 5. exd5 exd5 {I exchange pawns with him, clearing up the e-file and leaving his king somewhat exposed.} 6. Nxd5 {He eats my pawn, but I'm not too concerned with losing it...} Bd6 {...since his knight isn't putting any of my pieces in danger, I'm planning on a kingside castle (O-O). The reason for this is because a check can possibly be made (Re8+) if white doesn't close up the hole. This also means white can't castle until it leaves check, stalling a good defensive position for at least a turn.} 7. d3 Nf6 8. Nf3 O-O {I develop my knight and white mirrors, allowing me my kingside castle as planned.} 9. a4 {White advances his pawn, perhaps engaging the right as most of my pieces are developed leftwards. White is still open to check however...} Re8+ {...as such. White can't castle out of check, his only moves being Ne5, Ne3/Ne7+, Qe2, or Be3; most of which either wastes a piece, a turn, or both. The best choice here would be Be3, as it is the only move that wastes neither, and it develops his bishop.} 10. Be3 {White is almost forced to make Be3 as it is the best decision. This allows me a turn to make a tactical play...} Nb4 {...by placing my knight in between his pieces, I can trade it for white's knight and possibly his bishop (such as in c3 Nbxd5, Bxd5, Nxd5). White must take at least the knight trade or it will happen for him. } 11. c3 Nbxd5 {As} 12. d4 {White takes the trade, but is reluctant to give up more material...} Nxc3 {...I take more anyway. In its new position, my knight is now forcing his queen to develop or die.} 13. Qc2 Nce4 {I move my knight to safety, protected by the bishop on f6 and the rook on e8, while keeping within the king's reach. White can now be shoved into mainly defensive play with Qa5+.} 14. d5 Qa5+ {White is once again left with limited options: b4, Qc3/Qd2, Bd2, or Nd2. b4 would simply waste a pawn, while Qc3/Qd2 would waste his queen. Bd2 isn't much better as that undevelops the e-file blockade i made him carry out earlier. Nd2 is the best move in this position.} 15. Nd2 b5 {I can no longer keep him from castling, as there are too many pieces in the way. However, Castling at this point will only leave white trapped in his own defense. I set up to exchange more pieces to clear the way.} 16. b4 cxb4 {Queen may look trapped from b4 but I don't need her for the next few exchanges. } 17. Nxe4 Nxe4 {Knights are traded, though it favors my side because it gives me the more clear playing field that I was looking for.} 18. O-O {White inevitably castles, though it'll prove his downfall...} bxc4 {...his bishop is mine.} 19. Qxc4 {White moves his queen outward, though I don't see what he's trying to accomplish. My remaining knight still has ampoule protection, as well as any pieces he would hope to take on the 8-rank. His own pawn blocks access to the left side of the table, and my bishop on d6 keeps it that way.} Nc3 {My knight can now force white's king into the corner. Ponder Ne2+. White's only move in that case would be Kh1. This is a bad place for the king to be in because it's smothered behind its own pieces; any pieces capturing on h2 or g2 will render a checkmate if backed up by a single piece.} 20. Qc6 Ne2+ 21. Kh1 {The scenario previously mentioned has been fulfilled.} Qd8 {I chose Qd8 in this situation because I'm going to focus my aggression on White's self-trapped king, and I need the queen in a decent position for the tactic to work properly. White has few choices at this point, and movement of either rook to attack my knight will only make things worse, as Bg4 easily protects its position. White can't afford to lose any more material. Opening up his pawns might delay his downfall, but not for long.} 22. Rfe1 Bg4 {Though the bishop can be attacked by a pawn, it's no longer a good move. h3 would only allow for Qh4, which puts white in a very bad position, and an immediate mate is possible if white plays g3 right after (Qxh3#). f3/f4 isn't good either because it lets the rook on the e-file take white's remaining bishop without consequence (Rxe3). Regardless, the bishop can be force-taken (Rxe3) resulting in some nasty checkmate possibilities.} 23. f3 Rxe3 {White chose f3, which was probably not the best idea. Though white can take my bishop, The next few moves are downhill from here.} 24. fxg4 Qh4 {My queen moves into position to mate the king. I just need to get my rook in the right spot.} 25. h3 {Though white could have stayed in for a bit longer, this move sealed his fate. Ponder Rxh3+, gxh3 Qxh3#.} Rxh3+ {White's only move is to take my rook.} 26. gxh3 Qxh3# {Taking his pawn makes the checkmate.  [Thank you for reading!
