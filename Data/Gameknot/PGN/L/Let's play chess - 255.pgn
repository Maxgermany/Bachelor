1. e4 c5 2. b3 d5 {For some reason I wanted to fianchetto my bishop.} 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Bb5+ {I wanted to exchange queens early, because I could.  So I exchanged my King side bishop to open up the board.} Nc6 5. Bxc6+ Qxc6 6. Qf3 Qf6 7. Nc3 a6 8. Bb2 Qxf3 9. Nxf3 e6 10. O-O Nf6 {This is the position I wanted.  It's not often everything goes to plan on a chessboard.  At this point my play was put at ease.} 11. d4 cxd4 12. Nxd4 Bc5 13. Rad1 {Reminding myself to make strong moves instead of passive moves.} O-O 14. Rfe1 b5 15. Ne4 Nxe4 16. Rxe4 Bb7 17. Re5 {Instead of retreating.  I'm in the mood for a fight, and so is my opponent, it seems.} Rac8 18. Nf3 Rcd8 19. Rde1 Bd6 20. Rg5 f6 21. Rg4 Kf7 22. c4 {This is the winning move.  It opened up the left side of the board for me to have fun.  However, I had to be wary of my opponent's dual rooks and bishops.} Bc7 23. cxb5 axb5 24. Nd4 Be5 {He thinks he's slick.  I'll show him.} 25. Nxe6 {Bam.  If Bxb2 then Rxg7+ Ke8 Nc7#.  And if Rg8 then Nxd8+ and I'm up lots of material.} Kxe6 26. f4 g6 27. fxe5 f5 28. Rf4 Rd2 29. Rf2 {And I'm prepared.} Rfd8 30. Bc3 Rd2d1 31. Rfe2 Be4 32. Kf2 {This is a funny looking position.  If my bishop wasn't there, he could play Rd8d2 and it would look HELL-AIR-REE-YUS.} Rd1d3 33. Rc1 Ra8 34. Bb4 Kxe5 35. Rc5+ Rd5 {All this political maneuvering, and he still won't budge.  Well, I'll show him.  And another funny position.  Or its funny to me, anyway.} 36. Rc7 {HOW RUDE!!} h5 37. Rc6 g5 {BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  You have fallen right into my trap.  Now face the wrath of Khan! (Khan is Star Trek, right?)  Sultan Mir Khan is a much better player than I am.  Even though he's dead.} 38. Bc3+ Kf4 39. h3 {The Black King has nowhere to go.  His rook is mine.} Rd3 40. Rc5 g4 41. Bd2+ Rxd2 42. g3+ Kg5 43. h4+ Kf6 44. Rxd2 Rb8 45. Rd6+ Ke7 46. Rh6 {Black Resigns.}
