[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed"]

1. e4 {The most popular opening of all time chess playing. From the known history, the most played response to 1.e4 is 1...e5 and by a recent time there was an emerging initiative opening move to conduct robust games and may change the statistics, and that is...} c5 {The Sicilian Defense, an aggressive choice by black where white is discouraged to push immediate 2.d4 (other than KP openings, of course)!} 2. Nc3 {The second 'best' move to respond to 1...c5. The Closed Sicilian, probably it might transpose to the Open Sicilian as per mutual interest, but not necessarily. The replies would be more or less similar if played 2.Nf3.} d6 {Playing a second pawn to the center, White controls the two light squares in the center and the rest is in the domain of Black so far.} 3. f4 {An interesting move to take partial control over e4.} Nc6 4. Nf3 e6 {In the current position, both players have four pieces in total near the center.} 5. g4 {White is about to launch a king side pawn thrust. A typical intention in Grand Prix Attack.} Be7 6. h4 {All king-side pawns are on the 4th rank. IMO, it was too immediate to launch the attack. I'd prefer advancing the h-pawn further than rank 3 if Black castles in the king-side, a typical line being Bb5 (or more aggressive Bc4)/O-O/Qe1/Qg3 etc. to proceed with the 'steamroller' scenario.} d5 {A straightforward move where White has immediately decide about the e4 pawn. Along on the way to the war on the center, Qc7 would be preferably played before d5 which would create alternative threats on the pawn structure where White has to be really cautious.} 7. Bb5 {On the contrary, a threat to destruct the queen-side pawn structure with Bxc6 check where bxc6 is anticipated unless it is defended with bishop (or queen). If Black proceeds with dxe4, there would be isolated pawns and doubled c-pawns with another unstable pawn on e4.} Bd7 8. exd5 {The best of the available decisions regarding to the e-pawn. e5 push would continue as 8...d4! 9.Ne2/Ne4 f5 which makes development for Black pieces much clearer and easier than before (9.Na4 Qa5 -+).} exd5 9. g5 d4 10. Ne4 a6 {There is no immediate need to force the bishop to make some movement, 10...f5! was playable instead. En passant would create two isolated pawns on f and h files where the 'passive' horse finds an easy and good looking spot. En route, Black could play Qc7! (threatening Qxf4) which clears the way for O-O-O which makes White's plans severely off course.} 11. Bc4 Bg4 {Refer to the description at the move 10 by Black.} 12. d3 Qd7 13. Bd2 {One of those best diagonals this bishop is searching for is definitely a5-d8 but there is a horse staring at the a5 entrance.} Bd6 {Black is gradually getting comfortable and obtaining advanced squares to take out the pieces in the homeland.} 14. Qe2 Nge7 {He/she misses sharp f5! again, as the en passant capture ruins White's king side pawns or any other alternatives can be responded with g6 to 'lock the pawns' reliably.} 15. Qg2 {A nice tactical move, threatening Nxd6+. Notice that both of the black bishops are protected only by the queen.} Be6 16. Bxe6 Qxe6 17. Qh3 Qd5 {This seems to be a careless move where it allows the White queen to sneak at the Black king's 'safer area' (d7 and especially c8 which restricts queen-side castling). 17...Qxh3 18.Rxh3 O-O-O 19.O-O-O Nf5!! where the horse occupies a great outpost where it is immediately unchallengeable and reinforces the control on d4 and e3 squares. } 18. h5 Kd8 {With the current position, the leader should flee to the aforementioned safe zone regardless of the consumption of extra moves. Otherwise the oncoming cannonballs would be overwhelming! The trade of queens in the last move would make Black's game relatively easier.} 19. Kf2 Kc7 20. h6 g6 {Well, well! Finally there is a shield with some problems! The squares from e5 to h8 are been weakened, and White with still equipped with the DSB. One can argue that black DSB is also available, but from where it can enter the flawed diagonal?} 21. Nf6 {A multi-purpose move! A main threat lies at Qd7+ and it prevents a black rook to be placed on e8. And obviously, the next move should be done by the queen, the best alternative been...} Qf5 22. Qxf5 Nxf5 23. Nd5+ {Three great swinging places to the knight, you thought it correct, they are b6, d5 (where it currently is) and f6 (where it just was).} Kd8 24. Rhe1 {And now, is the time to get prepared to find adequate defenses against the ballistic 'rook' missiles. They could easily penetrate through the tunnel named 'e-file'.} Nce7 {With the increasing pressure, well, there's another overlooked move. It is essential to provide some barriers before the rooks penetrate. With this move, Black simply allows the White DSB dominating the a1-h8 diagonal, which was intended since about ten moves ago.} 25. Ba5+ Ke8 {Now the Black king has to creep into the king-side again (26...Kc8/Kd7 27.Nb6+ +-).} 26. Nf6+ {Forcing the king onto f8. Let's see at the armies, in comparison to the rook on e1, what does that on h8 doing? Black is coming up with major problems.} Kf8 27. Ne5 {A very good move. Nothing but to trade with the bishop, otherwise checkmate by Ned7.} Bxe5 28. Rxe5 {Look at the last four white moves, all of them being very aggressive responses and dealt within the opposing territory.} Rc8 29. Bb6 {A classic move! Neutralizes a and b pawns on the spot. Meanwhile the pressure on c5 also means the instability of the d pawn making a total of four weak pawns.} c4 {A desperate attempt to create something on the White's queen-side.} 30. Rae1 {Too much strain from the e-file. An interesting fact is both black horses were being restricted to move. If the knight on f3 moved, say Nd3, can be violently responded by Bxd4. I'll let you assume about the movement of the other knight.} cxd3 31. cxd3 Rc2+ 32. Kf3 Rh2 {In this position, the chess analysis provided by Gameknot reveals that this is a puzzle as; 'White to move and mate in 11'. Well, we'll discuss a little part of it.} 33. Bc5 Rh3+ 34. Kg2 Re3 {After some irrelevant moves, here comes to this board. The mate is not to complex to figure out. White declared the victory after Black hoisted their white flag.
