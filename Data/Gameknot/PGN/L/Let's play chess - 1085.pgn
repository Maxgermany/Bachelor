1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 {Against d4 try to play c5 later. The Nc6 blokades this push. This Knight stands better on d7!, after Nf6 example. d4 is an opening, which against You need patience, the counterattack cannot be so good, as against an e4 opening!} 3. e3 {Now if You had the knight on f6, You could play Nh5, too, after g6 example.  And Your defence on the kingside would be not worse, because of Nbd7-f6. It needs 2 tempos, but Your opponent lost his bishop-pair.} a6 4. Nf3 h6 {Too defensive now.  If Your opponent plays now Bd3, then he would have 3 pieces developed, and you just one. But not so bad, if You want to play Bf5, but h6 is too passive.} 5. h3 Bf5 6. c3 b5 {I think it weakens the pawnstructure, and You arenot developed enough for a counter attack. After a position like e6, Bd6, Nf6, 0-0, Qe7, Rfb8 would be it's o.k. - but now it is too fast. So d4 need patience!!} 7. b4 e6 8. Nbd2 Bd6 9. g4 Bh7 10. Bxd6 Qxd6 11. Nb3 {If Your Knight on d7 stands, now would be enogh a push on b6 and against b5 an a5.} Nf6 12. Bd3 {You must change Your bishop, because otherwise he will, and You cannot 0-0, and Your rooks will be not connected!!!} e5 13. Bxh7 Rxh7 14. dxe5 Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Qxe5 16. Qd3 O-O-O {Maybe better was a Qe4, to change the Queens. If he donot want the exchange, You win some territory and time for R7h8. Maybe You stands better after the exchange, because You can doubling Your rooks on the d-file, and place Your King on b6 and then the knight on e4 and the King on b6 enough defence for the push c5. - These are just plans. The opponent will move inbetween, too, but after Qe4 Qxe4 Nxe4 Rc1 is a must, and then R7h8, and I think You have the better position.} 17. Nc5 Qd6 18. a4 bxa4 {Insteed of this, You can play Ne4! Your N is a worse piece, then his N. Ne4 Nxe4 dxe4 Qxe4 R7h8 axb5 axb5 Ra8 Kd7 seems not so bad. White is better, but without his Knight not so good.} 19. Rxa4 Nd7 {Your Rook is hanging, too. It is over.} 20. Rxa6 Qe5 21. Ra8+ Nb8 22. Qa6# {}
