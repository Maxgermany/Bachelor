1. d4 {A lost game... A Londod attack, failed. } Nf6 2. Nf3 b6 3. Bf4 Bb7 4. Nbd2 e6 5. c3 {Not really necessary. The London attack must be played without any time loss, and this move is not really necessary. I must have played the g/h pawns inmediately. } d6 6. h3 Be7 7. e3 Nbd7 8. Qc2 O-O {Anyway, due to the passive play from black, the position have been reached.  Now, more aggressive for white is g4, but sooner or later Qc2 must be played in order to give some threat to the kingside, so it's ok. } 9. Bd3 Re8 10. Rg1 {Of course, more to take out the rook from the diagonal than really to support the pawn. } Bf8 {A very nice defensive move, aiming to support the center break e5. } 11. g4 {No excuse for playing the London attack and not... be attacking.} e5 12. Ng5 {This is the strong point. Black cannot play exB because of Bxh7+.} Qe7 13. dxe5 {Smartly defending f7, and indirectly threatening my king. I explored sac variants, but I didn't find a better following than this, that prevents the column to be opened. } dxe5 14. Bxh7+ {This was the mistake. I tried a combination, taking in c7 anyway, but it just doesn't work. } Kh8 15. Nxf7+ Qxf7 16. Bg6 Qe6 17. Bxe8 Rxe8 18. Bg3 {I have +1 material, but in fact my attack has vanished. I need some tempoes in order to reasset my pieces, and this gives time to black to get the best from his active pieces.} Nc5 {I must have castled, here, but Qxa2 was very annoying. } 19. f3 Nd5 20. Nf1 Ba6 {I didn't see c4. This was a great mistake. } 21. Bf2 Nd3+ 22. Kd1 Rd8 23. Bh4 Nd3b4 {Good move!} 24. Qb3 Nxe3+ 25. Ke1 Nd3+ 26. Ke2 Nc1+ {All forced, he wins my queen.} 27. Kf2 {I cannot take the knight, because of a nice mate in 3. Can you see it?} Nxb3 {If I go BxR, just NxR gives him a stounding advantage. } 28. axb3 Nxf1 29. Bxd8 Bc5+ 30. Kg2 Qd5 31. Rxa6 {Another mistake. But RgxN just will allow me to resist some more moves.} Qd2+ 32. Kh1 Qh2# {}
