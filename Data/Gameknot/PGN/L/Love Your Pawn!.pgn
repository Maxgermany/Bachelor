1. e4 {[Fun bit of trivia; the title of this annotation was inspired by this short song; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzy1MQPErOs - it was supposed to encourage graciousness with Singaporeans on the public transport system - Singapore's really big on that kind of stuff!] } e5 {[Also, as you'll discover very quickly, White is definitely not a beginner! He is at the 1500+ range at the very least - probably even higher!] } 2. f4 {It has been a long time since I've seen the King's Gambit played against me as Black, and from what I can tell about White's ongoing and past games, he plays the King's Gambit often. } exf4 3. Nf3 {Bc4!? is also playable here. } d5 {!? Other options here are 3...g5 [possibly leading to the Muzio gambit - after a crushing loss once in that line, I wasn't keen to try it again!] and 3...d6 [the Fischer Defence] but I wanted to play a move that perhaps White had rarely seen before, though to be honest, I didn't know this line either! A quick look at the Gameknot Database calls this Abbazia Defence } 4. exd5 {White accepts the pawn, and should Black recapture with the queen White can chase it with Nc3 } Nf6 {Instead, Black develops a piece and attacks the pawn again - I would much rather prefer the knight capture! } 5. Bc4 {Nope! If Black wants to win the pawn, his queen must come out! } Nxd5 {After a bit of thought, I decided that that was fine with me - I can acquire the bishop pair, even if my queen does get chased off! } 6. Bxd5 Qxd5 7. Nc3 {Naturally... } Qe6+ {...but I get to throw in a check with my retreat! } 8. Ne2 {!? I was fully expecting Qe2 here [developing another piece - White would be up three pieces to Black's one] but I'll take a guess that White wasn't willing to see the queens exchanged so early [I wasn't either, but White didn't know that! ;)] There's nothing wrong with this move, however. } Be7 {Bishop development. Bb4 doesn't really threaten anything, Bc5 is instantly rebuffed by d4 and Bd6 means that my own f4 pawn blocks its scope. That left the option Be7, and though I was thinking about a future Bh4+ at the time [with the f3 knight, that wasn't likely to happen!] it does help me with my next move... } 9. d4 {! good move - pawn thrust into the centre while discovering an attack on my f4 pawn, and now my Be7 helps... } g5 {...by supporting this pawn thrust to g5! } 10. O-O {Though there is no f-pawn to protect the king now, this castled position has proved to be very stable many times! [to my amateur mind, at least :)] Plus, White prepares Re1, threatening a discovered attack! } Bd7 {Black can't play g4 just yet because of the tempo attack White can get on the queen, but I was also concerned that White might try a Muzio-type sacrifice to get a big lead in development. Here's an example; 10...g4 11.Nxf4 Qa6 12.Bd2!? gxf3 13.Qxf3 and White has a scary lead in development! [Diagram can be found in comments] Would that have been sufficient compensation? I don't know... } 11. b3 {! White starts setting up a trap -if Black fails to see it, then 12.Bb2 followed by 13.d5! wins material. Of course, this also sets up a fianchetto, though it never happens in this game! } Rg8 {Pre-empting the threat early, while supporting the g5 pawn. I didn't know it yet, but this proves to be extremely helpful later on! } 12. Re1 {! White keeps the initiative, threatening a discovered check on the queen. } Qf5 {Moving away from the line of fire } 13. a4 {Correctly guessing that Black intends to castle queenside, White starts early operations on that side... But any future attack there is quickly forgotten as action picks up kingside... } g4 {Here is when the game starts to get interesting! I make this thrust, not so worried about a Muzio-style sacrifice because I'd have sufficient counter-pressure on g2, and am well developed. There are only two places where the knight can go to; e5 [aggressive] and d2 [? seems cramping, and limits the scope of White's bishop]. On h4, the knight hangs... } 14. Nh4 {...but it is, however, immune! 14...Bxh4? would lead to 15.Ng3+! Qe6 16.Rxe6+ fxe6 17.Bxf4 and White gains the advantage. } Qf6 {Seeing this, I decline the exchange and pile up on the knight on h4... and it does seem like White has dug himself into a hole here! White can't defend the knight as Black will win material anyway - 15.g3? f3! 16.[N moves] f2+, forking king and rook. } 15. Nxf4 {! However, this isn't a 'make the worst out of it' move - a far cry from it! Black has his own weaknesses that White fully exploits with this move! } Qxh4 {?! This move loses material, but allows me to execute my attack a bit later. You could call it an 'unintentional sacrifice'... or are those simply blunders? :) } 16. Nd5 {! The knight shows its true forking strength - of e7 and c7! One of them has to go! } Nc6 {Though I overlooked the king/rook fork [when trying to deal with the threat on my bishop, I saw this as the only move to protect it and played it immediately!] I would have played this regardless of whether I knew about it or not - allowing the rook to penetrate the position like it was threatening to didn't seem too appealing to me. Ironically, though, deciding to sacrifice queen for rook [had I let e7 fall] wouldn't have lost as much material as the line I chose } 17. Nxc7+ Kd8 {?! wrong king move? - The knight would have taken the rook anyway, and the king was a lot safer on f8, but it does prevent the knight from retreating back to c7. } 18. Nxa8 g3 {Despite the loss of material, I continue on with my plan. Qxh2 does not look at all appealing to White... } 19. h3 {so naturally, White prevents that with an attempt to lock up the position. This seems to be the best way to do things, since 19.hxg3 Qxg3 20.Qd2 Bh3 21.Re2 doesn't look at all good for White! Still, is it a solid defence? } Bxh3 {! As it turns out- no it isn't! Should White accept the sacrifice and capture the bishop, then Black's g3 pawn proves deadly; 20.gxh3 Qxh3 21.Qd2 g2 and the g-pawn (supported by Black's rook and queen) really puts the cramp into White's game! As for declining this sacrifice... } 20. d5 {...can anyone find anything better than this? I was fully prepared to play 21.Bxg2 to further chase the king, despite 20...dxc6+, but then found a simpler, and much more effective way of consolidating my advantage. If anyone can spot anything, comments are welcome! } Bg4 {!! Crushing! Right now, Black threatens both the queen and a mate in two - 21...Qh2+ 22.Kf1 Qh1#. As with most forks, White can't save 'em both! I should mention, it is the g-pawn that makes this combination possible! } 21. dxc6+ {The best move for White - Black had nothing to fear anymore from the discovered check because he can capture the attacking piece - this oversight has cost me more than a few games! } Bxd1 22. Rxd1+ Kc8 {This time, I make the correct king move, impeding the advance of White's pawn. } 23. c7 {All the hope that White has left now is on his own pawn, now passed and on the seventh rank. Unfortunately for him, Black won't allow him to capitalise on the passed pawn. White's next moves are pretty much forced } Bc5+ 24. Kf1 Qh1+ 25. Ke2 Qxg2+ 26. Kd3 {26.Ke1 Qf2# } Qd5+ {In this position, White will lose the rook after Kc3, but if he tries to protect it, he walks into a mate in 3. White chooses the latter option, but the position after 27.Kc3 Qxd1 would have been resignable anyway. } 27. Ke2 Re8+ 28. Be3 Rxe3+ 29. Kf1 Qh1# {Checkmate - aided by my rook, queen, bishop and my trusty g-pawn! :) }
