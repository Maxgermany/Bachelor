1. d4 {This game involves me playing a horrible opening and a terrific endgame.  I have a habit of bizzare opening . But I like to experiment with new stuff. It sometimes throws off better players. Even playing white I am the underdog.} d5 2. g3 {Went with a hyper modern opening- controling the center with less pawns.} Nf6 3. Bg5 {3.Bg5?     Horrible move!!!} Ne4 4. Bd2 Nc6 5. e3 {Now you see why... moving the same piece twice.... trapped on one side by pawns....} Bf5 6. Bg2 e6 7. Nc3 Bd6 {Good development by black, about to fix my bad opening.} 8. Nxe4 dxe4 9. f3 exf3 10. Bxf3 {Now I got some room to work with.  Need to finish the development.} Qe7 {10......Qe7?    Causes a double pawn. No good for black.} 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. c4 {Now the more traditional c4 to match the d4 pawn move... just the 12th move instead of the 2nd.} Be4 13. Nf3 Bb4 14. O-O {14.O-O! Brilliant. Got out of two pins in 1 move. Now to go on the offensive at last.} O-O 15. a3 Bxd2 16. Qxd2 Rab8 17. b4 Rfd8 18. c5 {Notice that black controls two half rows- but is countered by my  superior pawn structure. Do you see the three way fork?} h6 19. Ne5 {19.Ne5!  The c6 square is ohhh so dangerous for black. I will use that pressure to trap black's bishop - then do my dirty work.} Rdf8 20. Rf4 Bd5 21. e4 {In this position he is forced to sacrifice to save the queen/rook.} Bxe4 22. Rxe4 Qe8 23. Rg4 {Play on 24.Qh6 next move.} g5 24. h4 f6 25. hxg5 {25. hxg5!! My best play of the game. Horse sacrifice to lead to mate in 9. I will be truthful and say that I didn't see the exact mate , but I knew opening the f-h files would lead to a mate, just not exactly how yet.} fxe5 26. gxh6+ Kh8 27. Rg7 {This move sets up bringing in my queen then other rook to take advantage of the open rows and that critical h6 pawn.} Rg8 28. Qg5 Qd8 {I think 28.....Qf8 would be better...} 29. Qxe5 Qf8 30. Rf1 {The last straw . Blacks position is over!!!} Qxg7 31. hxg7+ Rxg7 32. Rf7 {32.Rf7! Another good pin.} Rbg8 33. Qh5+ Rh7 34. Qxh7# {One of my best game endgames against a better player, Jeremy Ross}
