1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. h3 e6 4. a3 b6 5. Bf4 a6 6. Nf3 Bb7 7. e3 Bd6 {I've been experimenting with this setup.} 8. Ne5 O-O 9. Bd3 {White is well-developed and probably has an edge.} Ne4 10. Bxe4 dxe4 11. Qg4 {White correctly targets my Kingside, now that the Knight is no longer protecting it.} f5 {I need the tempo from hitting the Q to organize my pieces for defense.} 12. Qg3 Bxe5 13. Bxe5 Rf7 {With a couple of the attackers traded off, my position is now awkward, but not worse if I have a little more time to get it organized.} 14. Ne2 Nc6 15. Bf4 Rc8 16. Bh6 {This is aggressive, but not really scary since g7 is well covered.} Qd6 17. Qg5 Kf8 {This removes the pin on g7, trapping the Bh6.} 18. Nf4 gxh6 19. Qxh6+ Ke7 20. c4 e5 {This hits the Nf4, but also the Q on h6.} 21. Qh4+ Kd7 22. Nd5 exd4 {I sneak another pawn.} 23. Rd1 d3 {This passed pawn is going to be a worry for White the rest of the game.} 24. O-O Ne5 25. f3 {This is possibly the right course of action.  White is down material, so he is doing everything possible to open up the position and get to my vulnerable King.  If I can solidify my position, my material advantage should win in the end.} Bxd5 26. cxd5 Qxd5 27. f4 {It may be that fxe4 creates more problems.} Nc4 {Threatening Nxe3.} 28. Qf2 Rg8 29. Rdc1 {I'm not sure what the deal was with this move, but White is very constrained in any case.} Rfg7 {White's position is about to fall apart.} 30. Rfd1 Rg7xg2+ 31. Qxg2 {White resigned in view of Rxg2+ 32. Kxg2 Nxe3+ winning even more material.}
