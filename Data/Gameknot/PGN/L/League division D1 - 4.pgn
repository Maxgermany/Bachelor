1. d4 {these last months i try to fight my own fear of offensives. I like the clean attacks, which always come to late against average or strong players. On gameknot, I try to find some places for sacrifices, to fight myself against that pressure; this is an example } d6 2. e4 {white decided to occupy the center: a strong ambition} g6 3. Bd3 Bg7 {my first moves are defensive: i remember i am black.} 4. Be3 {white is not really offensive either.} e5 {proposing to open} 5. c3 {closing back} Nf6 6. Ne2 O-O 7. f3 Nc6 8. Nd2 {looks like he like symmetry} Ne8 9. O-O f5 {i decided on the last move to compensate white lack of offensive senses by mine.} 10. Qb1 {first time i see that kind of defense on that kind of black attack; would be curious to have someone opinion on the quality of it.} f4 {preparing g and h to come and join the party.} 11. Bf2 {forced.} h5 12. Kh1 g5 {black is gaining space on king side} 13. Ng1 {and white seems decided to think there is nothing to do on the queen side.} Bf6 14. Bc4+ {this move kind of helped me= i had the intention to move my king to let my rook pass.} Kg7 15. Nb3 g4 16. dxe5 {i think this move also helped me...} Nxe5 {my knight is so able to participate to the party...} 17. Be2 g3 {digging holes: i know i sacrifice a pawn here} 18. hxg3 fxg3 19. Bxg3 Bh4 {trying to eliminate an important defensive piece} 20. Bh2 Qf6 {bringing more material} 21. g3 {oho! i am losing a piece here... if Bg5, then f4 takes knight or bishop and destroy my attack, so...} Bxg3 {... i decided to keep the attack} 22. Bxg3 h4 {i guess this was a little surprise for white} 23. Bh2 Qg5 {dangerous of course to align king and queen...} 24. Qc1 {an exchange would lead to an easy winning for white} Qg6 25. Nd4 {excellent position for thins knight} Kh8 {avoiding a potential check} 26. Qe3 Rg8 {threatening direct mate} 27. Qf2 {Rf2 may have been more inspired? No, because h3 was threatening another mate witht the pawn... but though... I think Rf2 was better} Rg7 {No, i am not losing a time; i am avoiding the powerful Qxh4 (or Qh4 in case i play h3) and check followed by exchange or loss of hpawn} 28. Rad1 {not sure this move was useful, but white is on a passive zugzwang on king side} h3 {aha!} 29. Bxe5 {this could have been played sooner; ok, it had to be done} dxe5 30. Nf5 {interesting defense, but point less} Qg2+ {hello!} 31. Qxg2 hxg2+ 32. Kh2 gxf1=Q 33. Rxf1 {black has recuperate the disadvantage and is now on a winning position} Bxf5 {doubling the enemy pawns and installing the knight + liberating the second rook; i think this is an excellent move} 34. exf5 Nf6 35. Nh3 Kg8 {the white king has to be liberated, because the black king is going to the center and threatening Rh8 if able to pass on seventh line } 36. Bc4+ Kf8 37. Rd1 Ke7 {seventh line... threatening directly the king, and forcing the rooks exchange} 38. Rg1 {here we are} Rxg1 39. Kxg1 Rd8 {threatening Rd1 or Rd2} 40. Nf2 c6 {i have my time now... i decided to anticipate a potential counterattack} 41. Bb3 Rd2 {here i anticipated Nd1 followed by Nd7-Nc5 threatening the bishop, but also Kf6 and white is soon in a new zugzwang} 42. Nd3 {probable dismotivation mistake} Rxd3 {and resigned...}
