1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd2 a6 8. O-O-O Bd7 {The main alternative is 8 ... h6.  A typical continuation is 8 ... h6 9 Be3 Be7 10 f4 Nxd4 11 Bxd4 b5 12 Qe3 Qc7 13 e5 dxe5 14 fxe5 Nd7 15 Ne4 Bb7 16 Nd6  Qxd6 17 exd6 Bg5 18 Qxg5 hxg5 19 Bxg7 Rh4 (Short-Anand, Dos Hermanas 1997).} 9. f4 Be7 10. Nf3 b5 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Kb1 {So far, nothing new.  White has disrupted Black's kingside pawns, and Black's counter will be ... 0-0-0, evacuating the king to the wide open spaces of the queenside.  As it turns out, this has consequences in the endgame.  We're following Leko-Timman, Wijk aan Zee 1995.} Qb6 13. f5 O-O-O 14. g3 {The route to e6 lies through h3, not c4.} Kb8 15. fxe6 fxe6 16. Bh3 Bc8 {This prepares ... d5.} 17. Qe1 {Still following Leko-Timman.  White has a slight pull because of Black's airy king position and his loose central pawns.  Black's next two moves try to turn these pawns into a weapon with a thematic ... d5 counter.} Qc5 18. Ne2 d5 {Black's last two moves have created tension in the center, and White should release it immediately with 18 exd5 Rxd5 19 Rxd5 exd5 20 Bxc8 Rxc8 21 Nf4, maintaining a small advantage because of Black's fragmented pawn structure and exposed king.  Instead, he takes aim at e6 and his pull evaporates.} 19. Nf4 dxe4 20. Qxe4 {White appears to have pressure against e6, but it's an illusion since 20 Nxe6 Rxd1  loses a piece.} f5 21. Qe2 {The only move.  It's necessary to restrain the Black pawns, so the queen can't leave the e file.  The position is dead equal} Rxd1+ {Black's choice was between exchanging rooks or queens first.  The main alternative was 21 ... Qd4 22 Qxd4 bxd4 23 Bg2 e5 24 Nd5 Bc5 25 Nd2 Na5 26 Nf3 Nc6.} 22. Rxd1 Rd8 {Probably better than a) 22 ... Bf6 23 Nxe6 Qb4 24 c3 Bxc3 25 a3 Qxb2  26 Qxb2 Bxb2 27 Kxb2 Bxe6 28 Rd6, b) 22 ... Qc4 23 Qxc4 bxc4 24 Re1  Rd8 25 c3 Rd6 26 Bf1 Bf6, or c) 23 ... Re8 24 Nxe6 Bf8 25 Nxc5 Rce2 26 Nd7  Bxd7 27 Rxd7 Ne5 28 Rd8  Kc7.  On the other hand, this is another step toward an endgame where Black must play very accurately to avoid serious trouble.} 23. Rxd8 {The logical continuation, which forces Black's reply since  23 ... Bxd8 24 Nxe6 Qd5 25 Nxd8 Qxd8 26 Bg2 hands White a solid plus.  The second pair of rooks disappears, and Black's control of e5 is weakened.  After the following exchanges Black's weakness on the dark square complex b6, c5, d4, e5, f4, f6 and g7 will become apparent.} Nxd8 24. Nd3 {Gaining a tempo and increasing White's influence over e5.} Qc7 25. Nfe5 {Since it's pointless to attack the e pawn, White decides to neutralize Black's bishop pair by blockading his central pawns and occupying the long diagonal with his bishop.  Lifting the blockade will mean more exchanges, which favors White.} Bd6 26. Bg2 Bb7 {White can't be allowed to dominate the diagonal.} 27. Bf3 {This move may seem odd, but it has a clear objective:  controlling e5 without giving Black control of the a8-h1 diagonal.  Allowing Black to capture on g2 would deflect the queen from the e file; but capturing on b7 would bring Black's queen to the long diagonal, threatening an unpleasant check on h1.  The solution is to place the bishop on a square protected by the knight on e5, so that 27 ... Bxf3 can be met with 28 Nxf3, retaining control of the key central square.  White has no advantage, and his first priority must be to restrain Black's passed e pawn.} Bxe5 28. Nxe5 Nc6 29. Nxc6+ Bxc6 30. Bxc6 Qxc6 31. Qe5+ {Only the queens are left and the White queen has arrived on e5 with check.  After 31 ... Kb7 the game will still be dead even, with Black's central passed pawn balanced against White's secure king position, the exposed position of Black's king, and the possibility that White may create a passed pawn of his own on the either wing.   White, thinking he'd frittered away his advantage with 19 Nf4, offered a draw that Black refused.} Kb7 32. b3 {There was, after all, the threat of 32 ... Qh1  33 Qe1 Qxe1#.} Qd7 {Already, the geometry of the position is making itself felt.  The Black h pawn is a potential target, but even more important is the a1-h8 diagonal, particularly g7.  White's queen plays an important defensive role on the hot diagonal by covering b2, c3 and d4, and if she can arrive at g7 with check the Black h pawn will be lost unless Black can interpose his queen.  This limits the Black queen's mobility  On the queenside there is nothing but open space around the Black king, and if White can force a pawn to a5 then b6 will become dangerously weak.  Black could prevent this with 32 ... b4, which may have been a better option than the move played.   Or he could force a draw with 32 ... Qh1   33 Kb2 Qxh2 34 Qxe6 Qxg3 35 Qxf5 Qg7 , but he seems to have overestimated the strength of the passed  e pawn.} 33. a3 {Other possibilities are 33 Qc5 and 33 Kc1, neither of which holds out the slightest hope for a White advantage.} Qc6 {This "threatens" 33 ... Qh1  34 Kb2 Qxh2, but Black would have been safer after either 33 ... Kc6 34 Qc3  Kd5 35 Qa5 Qc6 or 33 ... Qd1  34 Kb2.} 34. Qd4 {White's queen now covers a4, b4 and b6 as well as the a1-h8 diagonal.  White can play this because 34 ... Qh1  is met by 35 Kb2 Qxh2 36 Qd7+  Kb8 37 Qxe6.  Now 37 ... Qxg3 walks into 38 Qb6  Kc8 39 Qxa6  Kd7 40 Qxb5 .  This invasion of b6 followed by a series of checks will recur later in the game and in a number of possible variations.  Black is still not in trouble, but White has a small edge.} Qc7 35. a4 {Since Black has chosen passive defence, White begins a series of pawn advances that increase the pressure on the Black position.} Qe7 {Black avoids 35 ... bxa4 36 Qb4+  Qb6 37 Qxa4, but he doesn't find the best alternative:  35 ... Kc6 36 g4 Qxh2 37 gxf5 exf5 36 Qf6  Qd6 39 Qxf5 Qd1  40 Kb2 Qd4  41 c3 Qd2 .  Now the White pawn reaches a5, from which it supports the queen's invasion of b6 and sits only 3 moves from the queening square should the a6 pawn fall.  } 36. a5 {Even so, it's hard to say if this was the best move.   36 g4 Qf7 (36 ... fxg4 37 Qxg4 e5 38 Qe4  Kc7 39 Qe3 bxa4 40 Qa7  Kd8 41 Qa8  kc7 42 Qxa6 axb3 43 Qa7 ) 37 g5 bxa4 38 Qb4  Ka7  39 Qxa4 e5 40 Qc6 f4 41 Qf6 Qc7 42 Kb2 also appears strong; but fixing the Black a pawn and controlling b6 seemed more appealing, especially since the advantage obtained by 36 g4 doesn't appear to be decisive.  The real trick for White will be to advance his g pawn to g5, creating a fast-moving pawn majority on the g and h files.  That threat cuts both ways, because it also means Black has to be very cautious about pushing his f pawn.} Qc7 {Black can't concede b6.  Both 36 ... Ka8 and 36 ... Kc8 drop the a pawn.} 37. Qe3 {This is stronger than 37 Qf6 because it keeps an eye on b6.  White rightly avoids 37 b4, which would cripple his queenside pawn majority and weaken his king position.  Should Black later attempt (or be forced) to exchange queens, variations might arise in which White's ability to force a passed c pawn would be decisive.  And, once the g pawn reaches g5, Black could only exchange queens if it meant the immediate queening of one of his central pawns, since White could then force passed pawns on the c and g or c and h files, against which the Black king would have no defence.} Qd6 {37 ... Qc6 was also playable.  37 ... Qxa5 loses material but would probably have resulted in a draw after  37 ... Qxa5 38 Qxe6 Qd2 39 Qf7  Kc6 40 Qxh7 Qd1  41 Kb2 Qd4  42 Ka2 Qf2 43 Qh6  Kb7 44 Kb3 Qd4  45 c3 Qf2  46 Kb1 a5.  Black has liquidated the threat on a5, broken up the White king's pawn cover, and threatens to create his own passed a pawn--all at the expense of a single pawn.} 38. h4 {This maintains White's tiny edge and sets Black some problems, since now after 39 g4 there's no pawn on h2 for the queen to capture, as in 38 g4 fxg4 39 Qe4  Kc7 40 Qxg4 Qxh2 41 Qxe6.  } Kc8 {Or 38 ... Qd1  39 Kb2 Qd6 40 h5 Qc6 41 Qd4 Qc7 42 g4 fxg4 43 Qxg4 Qe5  44 Ka2 Qf5.   Black has no real counter play because of his weak pawns on a6 and h7 and his unwillingness to exchange his e pawn.  If his queen strays too far, White either captures the e pawn or invades b6.  If Black pushes the f pawn, White's g pawn reaches g5.} 39. Qf3 Kb8 {Black meets the imaginary threat of 40 Qa8  by moving his king onto a less favorable square.  Now, when the White queen finally penetrates to b6 it will arrive with check and the a pawn will fall, also with check.  It's probably worth noting that it's been 9 moves since White's queen arrived at e5, and Black's central pawns are still on e6 and f5.} 40. g4 {This push had to be made sooner or later, and it's more effective now than it would have been a move or so ago because after 40 ... fxg4 41 Qxg4 White's queen is preventing a check on d1 and threatening to win Black's h pawn (42 Qg8  and 43 Qxh7 ).  Black is forced to either defend the seventh rank with his queen (41 ... Qd7, 41 ... Qe7) or, slightly better, bring his king to c7; but after 41 ... Kc7 42 Qg7  Qd7 43 Qg1 Kd6 44 Qb6  White has a strong, although perhaps not a winning, advantage.  } f4 {Black finally manages to advance one of his central pawns, and it immediately lands him in a lost position because White's g and h pawns will advance much faster than Black's e and f pawns.  The best defence was 40 ... Qe5, forcing the exchange of either the g or h  pawn:  41 g5 (best) Qe1  42 Kb2 Qxh4 43 Qe3 Qe4 44 Qb6  Qb7 45 Qxe6 f4 46 Qd6  Qc7, with an advantage for White; or 41 Qd1 fxg4 42 Qxg4 Qe1  43 Kb2 Qe5  44Ka2 h6 45 Qb4 h5 46 Qf8  Kb7 with a slight edge for White.  } 41. g5 {White's kingside pawns must advance, but which one should take the lead?  41 h5 Qd2 leads to an instructive variation in which the White queen creates havoc by first seizing the a1-h8 diagonal, then visiting g7 and b6 (with check):  42 h6 Qe1  43 Kb2 Qe5  44 Qc3 Qe4 (the White king catches the f pawn after 44 ... Qxc3  45 Kxc3 Kc7 46 Kd2 Kd6 47 g5 f3 48 g6 hxg6 49 h7 f2 50 Ke2) 45 g5 f3 46 Qg7 f2 47 Qf8  Kc748 Qxf2 Qe5  49 Kb1 Qxg5 50 Qb6  Kd7 51 Qxa6 Qg1  52 Ka2 Qc5 53 Qb7  Qc7 (53 ... Kd6 54 Qxh7, and the White c pawn is defended) 54 Qxb5  Kc8 55 Kb1 Qc3 56 a6 and White wins easily.  Black does a little, but not enough,  better with 41 ... Qd4:  42 Qc6 Qd1  43 Kb2 Qd4  44 Qc3 Qe4 45 g5 f3 46 Qf6 Qe3 (46 ... f2 ) 47 g6 hxg6 48 hxg6 g2 49 g7 Qg4 50 Qd8  Kb7 51 Qb6  Ka8 52 Qxa6  Kb8  53 Qxb5  Kc7 54 Qb6  Kd7 55 g8Q Qxg8 56 Qxf2 Qg7  57 Kb1 Qg4 58 Qa7  Kc8 59 Qb6 Qe2 60 a5 and White wins.  On the other hand, 41 g5 Qd2 42 Qe4 might have led to a wild and woolly four queens shootout (See note to Black's next move.).} Qe5 {Black can offer more resistance with 41 ... Qd2, since from d2 the queen threatens White's a pawn, defends the pawn on f4, and is ready to give check on e1.  Now 42 h5 can be met with 42 ...Qe1  43 Ka2 ( 43 Kb2 Qe5 ) Qxa5 , so White's best try seems to be 42 Qe4, attacking  the e6 and h7 pawns and preventing 42 ... Qe1 .  Since 42 ... Qxa5 43 Qxf4  is obviously bad for Black, he should once again opt for active counterplay with 42 ... Qd1  43 Kb2 f3.  The f pawn is now too far advanced for the White king to stop, so White is no longer able to seize control of the a1-h8 diagonal by interposing his queen on c3, and after an exchange of queens he'll lose the race to the queening square unless he can force h4-h5 without allowing the f pawn to advance.  White's best try is 44 Qf4  Kb7 45 Qf7 , when at least one of Black's pawns must fall with check:  45 ... Kb8 (45 ... Kc8 (or 45 ... Kc6) 46 Qex6  Kc7 47 Qb6  Kd7 48 Qa7  Ke6 49 Qxa6 ) 46 Qg8  Kc7 47 Qxh7  with a clear advantage.  Black now has two main choices, interposing the queen by 47 ... Qd7, or fleeing to d6.   After 47 ... Qd7 48 g6 f2  (other moves are too slow) 49 g7 f1Q 50 g8Q Qf6  51 Kb1 Qxh7 52 Qxh7  Kd6 53 h5 we have a position that illustrates the true nature of White's enduring superiority:  even after the "exchange" of passed pawns White's secure king position and outside passed pawn give him a winning advantage.  Black can't achieve perpetual check and he can't play 53 ... e5 because then 54 Qg6 forces the exchange of queens and 54 c4 forces a second passed pawn against which Black has no defence.  After 47 ... Kd6 48 Qa7 (Qh8 Kd7 49 Qf6) Qe2 49 Qd4  Ke7 50 Gf6  Kd7 51 g6 f2 52 g7 Qg4 53 Qf7  Kd6 54 g8Q Qxg8 55 Qxg8 f1Q Black has once again queened his f pawn only to find that White has a winning advantage because of his secure king and outside passed pawn.  } 42. Qf2 {The ideal square for the queen.  White prevents 42 ... Qe1 , defends c2 and h4, obstructs Black's f pawn, prevents a check from d4 (after ... Qd6 and --- Qd1 ), and takes aim at b6.} Qd6 {Black's other option is 42 ... Kc8, when White does best with 43 Qa7 Qe1  44 Kb2 Qe5  45 Ka2 b4 46 Qxa6  Kb8 47 Qb6  Ka8 (47 ... Kc8 48 Qxb4) 48 a6 Qe4 49 Qc7 f3 50 h5 f2 51 Qc8  Ka7 52 Qc5  Kxa6 53 Qxf2.  Once again, Black has traded his f pawn only to find himself in losing position:  53 ... Kb5 54 Qf1  Kb6 55 Qc4 Qa8  56 Kb2 Qh8  57 Kb1 Qe5 58 g6 hxg6 59 h6 Ka5 60 h7 Qh8 61 Qc5  Ka6 62 Qd6  Qb5 63 Qd7  Ka5 64 Qf7 Qe5 65 Qa7  Kb5 66 Qb7  Kc5 66 Qc8  and the h pawn gueens.  } 43. h5 {Now Black has no defence against 44 Qb6  and 44 g6.  43 ... Qd1+  loses to 44 Kb2 Qxh5 45 Qb6  Kc8 46 Qxa6  Kb8 47 Qd6  Kb7 48 Qe7  Kb8.  And 43 ... Qe5 fails against 44 g6 hxg6 45 hxg6 Kc8 46 Qg2 Qe1  47 Kb2 Qe5  48 Ka2 f3 49 Qxf3 Kc7.} e5 {This appears to be designed to hold back the g pawn.  43 ... Qd1  44 Kb2 Qxh5 45 Qb6  Kc8 46 Qxa6  Kb8 47 Qd6  and Black's busted.} 44. g6 {Anyway.  As advertised, the White kingside pawns advance much faster than the Black pawns on the central files.  After 44 ... hxg6 the threat of Qb6  and a passed pawn on h6 will be too much for Black to overcome.  The Black queen can't keep the White queen out of b6 because an exchange of queens leads to a new White queen on h8, and once the White queen reaches b6 with check the game's as good as over.} hxg6 45. h6 {The h pawn can't be stopped, and Black's extra pawn wouldn't matter even if he could hold it.} Qd1+ {There's nothing better.} 46. Kb2 Qd7 {There are no more checks.  Once again, Black can't offer an exchange of queens by 46 ... Qd4  because after 47 Qxd4 exd4 48 h7 f3 49 h8Q  the f pawn will soon be lost.} 47. Qb6+ {Black could resign here.  The queen will win the a and g pawns, after which Black has no meaningful counterplay and no way to stop the h pawn.  47 ... Qb7 48 h7 is hopeless:  48 ... Qxb6 (48 ... f2 49 h8Q#) 49 axb6 f3 50 h8Q  Kb7 51 Qf6 f2 52 Qd6 f1Q 53 Qc7  Ka8 54 Qa7#; 48 ... Kb7 49 h8Q Kxb6 50 Qxe5 and the pawns have no chance against the queen.} Kc8 48. Qxa6+ Kb8 49. Qxg6 Qd4+ 50. Ka2 Qf2 51. h7 Qh2 52. Kb2 {This position says it all.  White's king is safely nestled among his queenside pawns, his h pawn is ready to queen, and his a pawn is poised to create mating threats against the exposed Black king.  On the other hand, the Black e and f pawns that once appeared to offer chances for a win have managed to advance one rank--to squares where they prevent the Black queen from giving check.} Kc7 53. Qg7+ Kc6 54. h8=Q Qxh8 55. Qxh8 f3 56. a6 {The fastest way.  Now when the queen arrives on f6 Black will either have to allow the a pawn to gueen or let his king fall into a mating net.} Kb6 {It looks like Black wants to be mated.} 57. Qf6+ {The Black king can't block the a pawn:  57 ... Ka6 58 Qc6 and mate next move.  If the King escapes to a5 or c5, it can no longer catch the a pawn.  The last try is 57 ... Kc7 58 Qe7+  and the a pawn queens or Black gets mated.} Ka7 {If you're going to play on a queen down, and take a couple of long postponements into the bargain, then the least you should do is have the courtesy to put up a fight.  Instead, Black makes the weakest move available.  It's mate in 2.} 58. Qc6 {Faced with mate in one, Black took another postponement.   After a day or so he resigned.  }
