1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {Decided to try the Moscow variation against the Semi-Slav defense.} Bd7 4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 5. c4 e5 {I believe this denies me the Marcozy bind.} 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. d3 a6 {prevents Nb5 from targeting his d pawn. I wasn't really looking at that though, was eyeing the nice d5 perch for my knight.} 8. Bg5 {And so I try to drive that knight of his away.} Be7 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 {took the exchange because it allows me that perch.} 10. Nd5 Bd8 {A good position for his bishop to be ... for a long time, this bishop would prove to be a key factor keeping my knight at d5.} 11. a3 {I think this was to attempt b4 to dislodge his annoying c pawn.} b5 12. b3 {b3 instead of b4 because I did not wish to break my pawn structure in the center and because if the exchange took place, my rook was in a better position to control the b file.} O-O 13. O-O {I castled as well as a "wait and see" option.} Nc6 14. Nd2 {I think my intention was to push f4 to force the e pawn off and control the f file using my rook.} h6 15. f4 Nd4 {This was what I was afraid of when I moved my knight from f3. While my queen currently prevents that knight (in the same way his bishop is placed) from causing any trouble, I do not want the queen to be inactive because of that.} 16. fxe5 {Sticking to the plan.} dxe5 17. Nf3 {Aiming to remove that possibly dangerous knight from play.} f6 {While it was true I threatened the e pawn, that was not really my main goal.} 18. Nxd4 cxd4 {probably superior to exd4, as it does not expose his king-side to a possible pass-pawn.} 19. c5 {I had to remove the danger of bxc4 as that gives him sufficient tempo to bring his rook to control the c file.} Rc8 20. b4 {that seals up the queen-side for a while. a5 simply buys me a tempo for it is far to my advantage for me to move axb4 than bxa5. Now my attention (and worries) have to be directed at the f file. f5 followed by fxe4 would sink my knight.} f5 21. Qf3 {My only reasonable defense I believe. 21. ... fxe4,  22. Qxe4 exposes his weaker rook to my stronger doubled rook. At the same time my knight is kept alive by the queen, but just barely. I believe my plan was to do Nb6 for the bishop-knight exchange if it looked like he could pressure my queen. 22. Qxe4, Rf4 would force a rook exchange that probably gives me a stronger positional advantage.} f4 {This was troubling. 22. ..., Rf5 could mean penetration of my defenses.} 22. Qh5 {Not sure why I did this ... I think it was to attack the pawn on the e file (helping to secure the f pawn) but it almost got my queen trapped without hope. I believe 22. g4, ... 23. h3 would have served me better.} Qe6 {Notice my queen is almost trapped.} 23. Rf3 {I certainly did not notice that at the time. My obsession was to double the rook on the f file for the attack.} Rc6 24. Raf1 {Still oblivious to the danger my queen was in.} Bg5 {This move woke me up. 24 ..., g6 loses me the game. My original plan of 24. g3 to force an advantages pawn exchange would have trapped my queen beyond rescue. For now, the queen is safe if my g pawn stayed where it was, but I had very little room for error and very few options if I kept the g pawn in place.} 25. g4 {Which led to this. The plan was to pull the queen to the safety of h3 in response to g6 and then back-off to g2 so I could push h3 to shore up my defenses. This, of course, leaves me vulnerable to h5 which could lead to an exchange where I have a rather weak pawn on the g file.} Kh7 26. Rh3 {moving his king gave me an opportunity for an attack. Qxg5 wins a free bishop if he does nothing about it.} Qg6 27. Kg2 {This was starting to get uncomfortably dangerous.} Qxh5 28. Rxh5 {The queen exchange might have been a blunder on his part. Made things somewhat safer for me. The h rook is still in the same danger of g6 though, which wins him a tempo since i would have to withdraw.} Rcc8 {not sure I understood the intent of this move.} 29. Kf3 {I prefered Kf3 instead of Rf3 because I sensed that if he did Ra8, I could respond with Ra1 in order to support the a pawn in the event of a5 ... axb4 ... Nxb4 (axb4 would be a terrible move on my part).} g6 30. Rh3 Bd8 {Back to the annoying position for his bishop.} 31. Ke2 {This is to allow Rhf3, continuing to block the pawn while freeing both my h rook and the h pawn.} g5 32. Rhf3 Ra8 {He takes advantage of my rush to clear my congested position to pursue an attack on the a file.} 33. c6 {I looked at my options and this was the only good one, imho. I threaten Rc1 which supports a very dangerous pass-pawn while opening squares for a possible rook attack on his rear pawn structure.} Rf7 {He recognizes the need to prevent my pawn from going further.} 34. Rc1 Rc8 {At this point, I noticed how I can tie 3 of his pieces up using just 2 of my pieces. If I could move my other rook into play, that c pawn would be devastating.} 35. Rf2 {Rf1 would take too long. Rf2 followed by Kf3 is the desired shortcut that simultaneously allows my king to physically block his f pawn.} a5 36. Kf3 axb4 37. axb4 {After I made the exchange thinking it was safe, I realized a sequence which could have caused me potentially serious problems in my rear - 37. axb4, Ra7 38. Rfc2, Ra3.} Be7 {Possibly his first blunder. Nxe7 would not be good for me, but this move simply gives me the extra time for Rfc2 (which was what I intended in the first place). At the same time, the bishop now blocks his f rook from doing anything useful in that constricted position.} 38. Rfc2 Bd6 {Not sure this move buys him much, other than freeing the 7th rank for his rook.} 39. c7 {The goal is to allow Rc6. In this cramped position dominated by my knight, he has few means of preventing the rook from penetrating his defenses. My goal was to get rid of his extremely weak and indefensible b pawn. Of course, because his bishop will be forced away from d6 by this move, my c pawn remains secure even after I move the rook off the file to attack his b pawn.} Kg6 {His 2nd and most critical blunder i believe. He just walked his king into a position where his bishop would be pinned by my rook (where I wanted to go in the first place).} 40. Rc2c6 Rd7 {His only option of holding everything together. Unfortunately, it opens his rooks up for a fork by the knight.} 41. Nb6 Rdxc7 {I believe this is his final blunder.  41. Nb6, Rcxc7 would have been a far better move. It would still have resulted in pretty much a lost position though.} 42. Nxc8 Rxc6 43. Rxc6 {}
