1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bd2 {The text move breaks the pin, but is considered a less ambitious plan for white. It does offer the advantage of a better pawn structure.} O-O {Nimzo-Indian, last book move.} 5. e3 {Another alternative is Nf3, but e3 appears okay, it safeguards d4, and provides clearance for the f1 bishop, while protecting c4.} b6 {The beginning of a interesting idea to put pressure on g2 by Bc8-b7, which aims to create an advantage based on the lack of development for white and with the idea that white expects to castle short. However, white can play Bf1-e2, then Ng1-f3, where after ...Bxf3, then Bxf3 ...Nc6 to protect the rook - blocks in the c pawn which is usually pushed to c5.} 6. f4 {White loses the thread and forsakes development, but has little to gain from this move which creates a weakness at e4.} c5 {Black continues with a correct move typical of this opening.} 7. a3 {White over reacts to the bishop, better is to develop in preparation for castling.} Ba5 8. Bd3 Bb7 {Now a real threat appears at g2, and next h1.} 9. Nf3 {Develops and controls e5 while protecting the rook from attack.} d5 {Black complicates the position some.} 10. Ne5 {White applies some Nimzowitsch blockading with the knight which reinforces c4.} dxc4 {Creating two attacks (d3, g2).} 11. Nxc4 {White threatens to gain the bishop pair advantage after Nxa5, but overlooks the weakness at g2.} cxd4 {Black creates another threat while opening up the center. A good plan since the white king is still in the center.} 12. Nxa5 {The text move is stronger than 12.exd4 because it threatens the unprotected bishop at b7 while capturing the a5 bishop.} bxa5 {Maintaining the bishop at the expense of the pawn structure - a necessary choice.} 13. exd4 Qxd4 {There are two threats (Qxd3 and Bxg2).} 14. Qe2 {White observes both threats and provides a counter.} Rd8 {Renewing the threat (Qxd3).} 15. Bxh7+ {Desperation - the piece could not be saved.} Nxh7 16. O-O-O {A quick save of the bishop.} Nc6 17. Rhf1 f5 {A questionable move which creates a weakness at e6.} 18. Qxe6+ {White takes immediate advantage of the weakness to gain two points.} Kh8 19. Qxf5 Ne7 {Creates two attacks (f5, g2).} 20. Qh3 {Pins the h7 knight. Both players have a lack of coordination of pieces. Black has 2 hanging pieces.} Bc8 {Disrupts the coordination of the rooks for a cheap shot at the queen.} 21. f5 {The text move (?!) could lose R P to B N, with slight favor to black.} Qf6 {Threatens to take the pawn.} 22. Ne4 {Leaves an open line for black.} Qc6+ 23. Bc3 {Blocks the check, but also targets g7.} Bxf5 {--/ } 24. Rxd8+ Rxd8 25. Rxf5 {A questionable move.} Qxe4 {The best choice. Not (25...Nxf5?  26.Qxf5) with 2 pieces for the rook.} 26. Rxa5 Rf8 27. g4 {Prevents (27...Rf1 ).} Qh1+ {Maybe (27...Nc6) to bring another piece into the attack would be better.} 28. Kc2 Rf2+ 29. Kb3 Qb7+ {With the idea of bringing the knight into the attack to take the bishop.} 30. Ka2 Nd5 31. g5 Nxc3+ 32. Qxc3 Qf7+ 33. Kb1 Qg6+ 34. Ka2 Nxg5 35. Qe3 Qe6+ {Black feels confident that a forced queen trade will provide a favorable endgame because of the extra piece.} 36. Qxe6 Nxe6 37. Rxa7 Rxh2 {There is some danger of a pawn promotion for white due to the connected passed pawns, but black has a chance to promote first.} 38. a4 g5 39. a5 Rh7 40. Ra6 {White can not lose the rook because the knight will stop the a pawn, and the rook is needed to block the g pawn.} Re7 41. Rc6 g4 42. Rc3 Rg7 43. Rg3 Kh7 {The knight can not participate in attacking the rook because of the a pawn.} 44. b4 Nc7 45. Ka3 Kh6 {Black makes a bold decision to chase the rook by using the king. Nice.} 46. Ka4 Kh5 47. b5 Kh4 48. Rg1 g3 49. b6 Rg4+ 50. Kb3 Na6 {A nice blockading move.} 51. Kc3 Kh3 {The rook will be forced out.} 52. Rh1+ Kg2 53. Rh8 Kf3 54. Rf8+ Rf4 {White forfeits on time, but the pawn promotion can not be stopped and black would get a queen and win. White does not have time to eliminate the knight and promote pawns. A nice game with interesting play.}
