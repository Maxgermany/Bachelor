1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Bc5 {Often 4... Nxe4 5. Nxe4 d5 is played. For this reason d3 is usually played before Nc3. But I opted for the quieter Bc5 this time.} 5. d3 {The Giuoco Pianissimo.} h6 {A prophylaxes against Bg5 or Ng5- I have immediately played d6 in the past, but I prefer this line.} 6. O-O O-O 7. a3 d6 8. b4 {This puts us out of book- the computer recommends 7...a6 to give the dark squared bishop a cubby-hole.} Bb6 9. Bb2 Bg4 10. Na4 Re8 11. Nxb6 axb6 12. h3 Bh5 13. g4 Nxg4 {! Black is only -.5 here, but the play gets sharp from here and white must tread carefully. A similar game was played between MVL and Aronian at the St. Louis Blitz and Rapid tournament this year, only with the roles reversed.} 14. Bxf7+ {?? An outright blunder. I suppose the expected response was 14... Bxf7. Better is 14.hxg4 Bxg4 15.Kg2 Qf6 16.Rh1 -0.8 -+} Kxf7 15. hxg4 {Allowing black to follow through with his attack. b5 is the correct salvaging move, at least for the time being.} Bxg4 16. Kg2 Qf6 17. Qe2 Nd4 18. Bxd4 exd4 19. Rfh1 Kg8 {With Rf8 to come, white has climbed too deep into black's attack. -6.6} 20. Rag1 {? Sac-ing the exchange with Rh3 is the best hope here.} Ref8 {And white resigns. Continuation is likely 21. Rh3 Bxh3+ 22. Kxh3 Qxf3+ 23. Qxf3 Rxf3+ 24. Kg2 Raf8 -9.7 with black up a rook and a passed h-pawn.}
