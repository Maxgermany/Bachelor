1. e4 {My traditional opening.} d5 {As pointed out in my other annotation, although the ratings between the two players are just numbers, my opponent was still more skilled and had more experience than me, so I had to be ready for moves I didn't expect or usually see, like this one.} 2. d3 {f3 would of been better.} dxe4 3. dxe4 {I get myself in a bad position early.} Qxd1+ {The queens are gone early. As pointed out in the other annotation, we both like to do even trades.} 4. Kxd1 {The problem is now I can't castle.} e6 5. Bb5+ {Worth a shot.} c6 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. g3 f6 8. Bf4 Bxf4 {Some more trading.} 9. gxf4 Ne7 {And he gets ready to castle. } 10. f3 {There's nothing I can do about it.} O-O 11. f5 e5 {Wasn't expecting that. I was expecting him to attack like in this game and the other game. This was the first time he basically countered.} 12. Bc4+ {Again worth a shot.} Kh8 {That time it was forced pretty much. Any other move to protect the king would of resulted in a disadvantage for him.} 13. Na3 b5 14. Bb3 Ba6 15. c4 {More trading I hope.} b4 {Again a counter, but of course this time my knight is in danger, so this made sense.} 16. Nc2 {I go for that pawn.} Rd8+ {I knew that was gonna happen sooner or later.} 17. Kc1 Nd7 {What? His b4 pawn has no protection. Alas, I'm a rookie.} 18. Ne2 {I saw stuff like that in our other game, but I missed that opportunity.} Nf8 19. Rd1 {I'm ready to take the rooks out of play.} Rxd1+ 20. Kxd1 Rd8+ {I knew that would happen.} 21. Ke1 {I prepare to do it all over again.} c5 {Now he protects the b4 pawn.} 22. Rd1 Rxd1+ 23. Kxd1 {All the really strong pieces are now gone.} g6 {I'm willing to trade.} 24. fxg6 Nexg6 25. Ne3 {I'm not sure what to do at this time. We're pretty evenly matched, but I rarely offer a draw, so the game continues.} Nd7 26. Ba4 Nb6 27. b3 Nxa4 {Some more trading.} 28. bxa4 Nf4 {As you can see, we are both willing to trade off our pieces, but black's structure was better than white's.} 29. Nxf4 exf4 30. Ng2 Bxc4 {I'm starting to lose now.} 31. Nxf4 Bxa2 32. Nh5 {It only got worse.} Bb3+ 33. Kc1 Bxa4 34. Nxf6 {I'm still behind a pawn. The big problem is black's a b and c pawns.} b3 35. Kb2 c4 {Mainly b and c.} 36. Nd5 Kg7 {It would of been better if I had engaged my e f and h pawns earlier.} 37. Ka3 Bb5 38. Kb4 a6 {My options are limited right now.} 39. Nc3 {I go for the bishop.} Kf6 {He's going for my pawns.} 40. Nxb5 {I take his bishop.} axb5 {All strong pieces are gone now. All that's left are the kings and pawns.} 41. Kc3 {I need to try to keep the two b pawns and a pawn from reaching the other side.} Ke5 {But I can't protect my pawns at the same time.} 42. h4 h5 43. Kd2 b4 44. Kd1 c3 {I really have no idea what to do, but I was going to keep trying.} 45. Kc1 b2+ {Now I had a plan.} 46. Kc2 b3+ 47. Kb1 {I knew black would use his king to take my pawns, but this move immobilized my king. I worked for this sequence 47. Kf4 48. e5 Kxe5 49. f4+ Kxf4. If this happens, the game will end in a draw, a stalemate, for my king and h4 pawn could not move. Winning was impossible, but losing was not inevitable. } Kf4 48. e5 Kxe5 {So far it is working.} 49. f4+ Kf6 {And fail. Dealing with someone experienced, psilure78 must of realized what would happen if the pawn was taken. He knew he could win still.} 50. f5 {No other move I could make.} c2+ {Now a draw is impossible and the f5 pawn is gone.} 51. Kxb2 {Well, so is that pawn.} Kxf5 52. Kc1 Kg4 {Now losing is inevitable. It would be impossible to stop all three black pawns with my lonesome king. Thus I resigned and this wonderful game was over. I hope you enjoyed both annotations. }
