1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Bf5 3. Nc3 c6 4. Bf4 Nf6 5. Ne5 Nbd7 {Up to this point these are just standard opening moves. } 6. Nxd7 Qxd7 7. f3 e6 8. e4 {the first real mistake of the game, black can now force the win of a pawn  } dxe4 9. Be5 {another bad move by white, this allows black to further develop his pieces towards the center} Nd5 10. fxe4 {with this move black can go up a pawn and make whites pawns awkward } Nxc3 11. bxc3 Bxe4 12. Qe2 Bg6 13. g3 {the only real problem black has is moving his king into saftey } f6 14. Bf4 Bd6 15. Bh3 Bf7 16. O-O {white allows the trade of bishops which should be avoided, because he is down material  } Bxf4 17. Rxf4 O-O-O {black finally moves his king to safety but has to survive one last assult} 18. Rd1 Rhe8 19. d5 cxd5 20. c4 Qc6 21. cxd5 Rxd5 22. Bg2 {black had already seen this move and saw that there was a defense for it with the inbetween move.} Rxd1+ 23. Qxd1 Qc7 24. Rb4 {here white has dropped an entire rook and can resign with a clear concius but continues to plot on in a hopeless situation} Qc5+ 25. Rd4 e5 26. Qf3 {white becomes the victim of a relntless assult after this move} Qxd4+ 27. Kf1 Bc4+ 28. Ke1 Qg1+ 29. Kd2 Rd8+ 30. Kc3 Qd4+ {white resigns here because there is no way to prevent the loss of his queen}
