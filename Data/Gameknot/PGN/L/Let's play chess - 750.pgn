1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 d6 3. Qf3 {I have never understood this move except for the novice players.} Nf6 4. d3 Nc6 {I am developing my pieces faster...} 5. c3 Qa5 {Trying to decide between this move and Ne5. Probably should have gone with the latter.} 6. a3 Nd4 7. Qd1 {I recognized a problem if he moved b4 if I didn't move my knight, so a full retreat.} Nc6 8. Nf3 b5 9. Bd5 Nxd5 10. exd5 Nd8 {I became very uncomfortable with the pawn in the advanced e5 position. I began looking for a way to eliminate him.} 11. Nbd2 c4 12. b4 cxb3 e.p. 13. Qxb3 Nb7 14. d4 e6 15. Ne4 e5 {I moved e5 because I didn't want to give his queen an advanced position in the event of exd5...Qxd5.} 16. Bd2 Qb6 17. O-O {My opponent has managed to create a far superior spacial advantage. She has had me on the retreat several times.} Na5 18. Qb4 Bf5 19. Ng3 Bd3 20. Rfe1 Nc4 21. a4 Nxd2 22. Nxd2 a5 23. Qb3 g6 {Panicking by now because I haven't castled yet.} 24. dxe5 dxe5 25. Rxe5+ Be7 {I was contemplating resigning. It looks positionally grim but I decided to stick it out.} 26. Rae1 Ra7 27. axb5 Qxb5 {I decided I wanted to take out her queen as that could seriously compromise my king's bad position.} 28. c4 {I believe her first mistake. Qxb5 is much better I think.} Qxb3 29. Nxb3 Bxc4 {Allowed me to get my pawn back.} 30. Nd4 f6 31. Re5e6 Bxd5 {Finally, I take the lead as well as get that advanced pawn out of the way.} 32. Re6e3 Kf7 {In this case, with an open board and 2 bishops compared to 2 knights, I have retaken positional lead in the game.} 33. f3 Bc5 {I love skewers.} 34. Rd1 Rd8 {Setting up for a major play.} 35. Ne4 {What keeps the play alive is that her king is still in line with my bishop.} Bxe4 36. fxe4 {Rxe4 is much better.} Bxd4 37. e5 Bxe3+ {Its over.} 38. Kf1 Rxd1+ 39. Ke2 Rd4 40. Kxe3 fxe5 41. g3 Rc7 42. h4 Rc3+ 43. Ke2 e4 44. g4 Rh3 45. g5 e3 46. h5 Rd2+ 47. Ke1 Rh1# {}
