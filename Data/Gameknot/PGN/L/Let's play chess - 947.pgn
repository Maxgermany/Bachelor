1. d4 {Hi all. I think you'll enjoy this game, it has beautiful maneuvers and combinations. This game was very exciting for because proves me I have an even little tactic knowledge. I have to admit my opponent made that easier because of his weird playing in the opening} d5 2. h3 {I'm weak in theory and don't know what kind of opening that move is. And I suppose my opponent wanted to try something new} Nf6 3. a3 {The same as previous post} c5 {I think the best playing vs this passive opening is the aggressive playing} 4. dxc5 e5 5. b4 Be7 {Maybe Nc6 is better} 6. c3 {Maybe to prevent d4 } O-O 7. g4 {Another move that surprised me. Maybe it is too early to attack} Nc6 8. e3 Ne4 {While all White minor and major pieces are at 1st rank, Black is almost finished with its' development. Knight at e4 is good placed and at the same time opens line for f5 later} 9. Bg2 Nxf2 {Destroying White defence} 10. Kxf2 e4 {To unfold e5 and to block white pole bishop} 11. Ne2 {White has to develop, anyhow} Bh4+ 12. Kf1 b6 13. cxb6 Ba6 14. Kg1 Ne5 {Threatening Nd3, then Nf2 or Nd3, then Bf2+ } 15. a4 Nd3 16. Rh2 Qd6 {The other line (which I missed) is Bf2+,...Kf1; Qd6,...Rh8; Be1,...Nf4; Nb2+,...Kxe1 etc with good advantage} 17. b5 Bb7 18. Ba3 Qh6 {The other variant is Qxb6 but then ...Nd4 and the rook is lost} 19. Bc1 f5 20. Nf4 Bg3 21. Nxd3 exd3 22. e4 Qxb6+ 23. Kh1 fxe4 {Now the Black advantage is huge} 24. Nd2 e3 25. Nf3 e2 26. Qxd3 Rxf3 27. Qxe2 {Forced} Rf2 28. Qd3 Bxh2 29. Be3 Rxg2 {!} 30. Bxb6 d4 31. Qc4+ Kh8 32. Qc6 {Forced} Bxc6 33. bxc6 Rc2 34. Bxd4 h6 35. Rf1 Rc8 36. Rf7 Rg8 37. c7 Bxc7 38. Rxc7 {Black tried almost all but now it looks chances are even... but Black holds 2-rank and puts in the battle a little expecting weapon... } Kh7 39. Rxa7 h5 {good move - opens white poles for the King} 40. g5 Kg6 41. h4 Kf5 42. Rxg7 Rb8 43. Rf7+ Kg4 44. g6 Kh3 45. a5 Rb1+ 46. Bg1 Rh2# {Thanks for watching}
