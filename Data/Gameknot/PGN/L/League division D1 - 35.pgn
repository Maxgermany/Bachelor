1. e4 {My typical opening.} c5 2. Bc4 {developing my bishop early.} e6 3. Nc3 {contesting d5.} Nc6 4. Nf3 d6 5. d3 Nf6 6. O-O Be7 7. Re1 a6 8. d4 cxd4 9. Nxd4 O-O 10. h3 Bd7 11. Bg5 Rc8 12. Nf3 b5 13. Bb3 {I try to keep my bishop pointing towards the king. Who knows? It might come in handy sometime.} b4 14. Nb1 a5 15. c3 bxc3 16. Nxc3 Nb4 17. a3 Na6 18. Qd3 Nc5 19. Qc2 Bc6 20. e5 dxe5 21. Nxe5 Bb7 22. Rad1 {Moving my rook here threatens his queen while controlling the middle} Qb6 23. Ba2 h6 24. Ng6 {I'm not sure what I was thinking here. I thought I could get my queen up close and even out points with exchanges.} fxg6 25. Qxg6 hxg5 {Not what I had in mind obviously. I'm now down 5 points.} 26. Na4 Qc6 {Good move. He threatens my knight and a checkmate.} 27. f3 Qxa4 28. Rxe6 {This is the climax of the game. If he takes the bait (Qxd1) I have his queen. I'm down 7 points.} Qxd1+ {He takes it! I have his queen now moving my rook to e1 both checking his king with the bishop (the one that came in handy) and threatening his queen with my rook.} 29. Re1+ Qb3 30. Bxb3+ Nxb3 31. Rxe7 {I gaining material back, but I'm still behind. I now pose a checkmate which can easily be thwarted.} Rc1+ 32. Kh2 Ne8 {I can take the knight and gain even more material, but I feel I need to keep my rook. I ignore the knight and go for the bishop instead.} 33. Rxb7 Nd2 {Here's where I get into trouble. I didn't see it coming.} 34. Qxg5 {Thinking I have his rook if he moves his knight, he does something I never expected.} Nf1+ {I have his rook! But I'm in check. D'OH! Looks like this might be a stalemate.} 35. Kg1 Nd2+ {If I move my king to f2, he can take my queen by forking on e4. I can't defend against that 'cause of the rook.} 36. Kh2 Rxf3 {Lucky me. He tries going for a checkmate somehow, but it's my move.} 37. Qxd2 {I guess he forgot about my queen.} Rff1 38. Rb8 {I pin his knight.} Kf7 39. Qd7+ Kf6 40. Rxe8 Rfh1+ 41. Kg3 Rhf1 42. Rf8+ Kg6 {I now check with my queen on d3 and take both rooks, thus ending the game!} 43. Qd3+ Kh6 44. Rxf1 Rxf1 45. Qxf1 {}
