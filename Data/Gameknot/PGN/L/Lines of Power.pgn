[Opening "Latvian counter-gambit (C40)"]

1. e4 {Hi all! Just a quick, spirited blitz game. As usual, open files and energetic piece deployment are the order of the day. Enjoy!} e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The Latvian Gambit. Black trades material (sometimes quite a lot of it) for open lines on the kingside. It's quite dubious and basically never seen in master play, but can be strong against unprepared opponents--and in blitz, everyone considers everyone else unprepared!} 3. exf5 {Not going to give a lot of analysis on the opening except to say that 3.Nxe5 is more popular. I have a big series of annotated games in this opening, so check those out if you're curious about it.} Nc6 {3...e4 is more common.} 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. O-O d5 {Gaining space for development with tempo.} 6. Bb5 Bd6 {The e-file, and the e-pawn in general, will be vulnerable until the BK can vacate it, usually to the queenside. Opposite-flank castling tends to favor whichever side has more midgame attacking possibilities, and with the half-open f file, the situation looks like it would favor Black at the moment (as it very often does in this opening).} 7. d3 {I think 7.d4!? is worth a look as well. 7...e4 is not much of a threat in response since White can parry with 8.Re1, which he wants to play anyway.} Bxf5 8. Bg5 {More pins on the Black Knights. Development is just about even, though White is playing more aggressively whereas Black has a better central presence, but more threats to respond to. I think 8.Bxc6 was worth a look though; opening up Black's queenside.} Qd7 {Unpinning one Knight momentarily, though it still can't really go anywhere if Black wants to castle queenside. This move also has the advantage of defending the Knight that needs defending--now White can no longer break open the BK's fortress with Bxc6.} 9. Re1 O-O-O {Allowing White to win the e5 pawn if he desires and setting up the desirable opposite-wings castling situation.} 10. Nc3 {Wisely (I believe) choosing to continue his development instead of 10.Nxe5 etc.} Rde8 {?! Sacrificing the d-pawn for development and general center control. This also unpins the Nf6, and leaves the Rh8 free to relocate to the f file or whatever other file needs its presence in the forthcoming attack on the WK.} 11. Bxf6 {White accepts the proffered pawn.} d4 {!? Choosing to hold tight to the center, this move doesn't prevent Black from losing a pawn, but it critically ensures that if White wants to win material, he must open another line against his King.} 12. Bxg7 {I think it would have been better to just move the Bishop back to g5, rather than opening the g-file for Black's heavy pieces.} Qxg7 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Ne4 {Let's take a second to analyze. Black has the bishop-pair (though his DSB is pretty worthless at the moment) and some beautiful open lines against the WK. His center is decent and he has better activity, but he'll have trouble in an endgame due to his worse pawns. White, on the other hand, lags in development but has a solid position and a very strong Knight at e4. His other, more lackluster pieces can also be quickly activated by initiating a queenside attack. I'd give Black a very slight edge here, but only if he can convert his activity quickly.} Bh3 {? A few moments after this move, I decided it was probably a mistake. It's intended to provoke 15.g3, but 15.Ng3 is a far superior way to eliminate the threat; forcing Black to move the Bishop again and clearing e4 for a Queen or Rook. I'm not sure what the correct move for Black was in this situation--14...Rhg8 15.Ng3 e4 looks interesting--but I'm pretty sure the text is inferior.} 15. Nxd6+ {? Not only trading a good Knight for a bad Bishop, but also forcing his own hand as to the response to the Kingside threat. As I said above, 15.Ng3 was much better, allowing pressure on the backwards e5 pawn and gaining tempo. This move is where it all goes south for White.} cxd6 16. g3 Ref8 {Tying the Queen to the defense of the Knight, and putting indirect pressure on the very weak f2 pawn. This also threatens to win material outright with ...Bg4! White's choice to trade off his Knight has left him struggling to find enough material to defend against Black's onslaught down the open files.} 17. Nh4 {Basically forced, although 17.Nd2 was worth a look, aiming for the e4 outpost.} Rf4 {?! Trying to be clever and gain time to play ...Rhf8, but this aggressive move isn't particularly sound; 18.Ng2 or 18.Re4 are both effective counters. Probably 17...d5 or 17...Rf6 were better ideas.} 18. Re4 Rhf8 {This was the planned move, and now additionally Black is hoping for an exchange on f4 followed by Qh5, giving him a chance to set a nasty trap for the WQ. Ng2 is no longer an option right away, but 19.Qe2 or 19.f3 are both fine.} 19. Rxf4 Rxf4 20. Qh5 {Critically, clearing the way for the Ra1 to get into action, but this Queen is actually on really thin ice--she must be exceptionally careful not to get stuck on Black's side of the board with nowhere to go.} Bg4 {! Closing the trap. The WQ has exactly one place she can run to.} 21. Qe8+ Kc7 {Look carefully. At this moment, White has exactly one way to save his Queen from the carefully-prepared snare. Of course he can't play 22.gxf4?? since 22...Bd7+! wins the Queen. The only way to save her is 22.Qa8, where after 22...Kb6 23.Qb8+ Ka6 she can escape through d6. Obviously at no point in this line does gxf4 become an option, since if it's played without the WQ guarding g6, gxf4?? Bh3+ is mate in two.} 22. Kf1 {?? Not good enough. White avoids the various discovered-check lines and flees from the mating threat, but leaves his Queen in the lurch.} Rf8 {0-1. With Q+B vs R+N, Black will have an easy time cleaning up the remaining White defenders, so White resigns. Many thanks for a great game, grandpoobah! Comments are much appreciated; thanks for reading!}
