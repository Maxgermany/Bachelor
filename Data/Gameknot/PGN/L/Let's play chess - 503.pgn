1. e4 {my usual, somewhat agressive oppening. } e5 2. Nc3 {vienna game} Nf6 3. Bc4 d6 {?closing path of black bishop} 4. f4 {I do this quite often, bring my pieces to center then sacrifice f pawn, to open it for my rook after castling. In past I had good results with it, also want to hear your opinions about it...but now I was kinda playing bindly and did moves uncarefully} Bg4 {and he starts attack} 5. Nf3 {the other option was bringing back my bishop to e2, which maybe wasa better move, but I wanted to develop while defending} exf4 6. d3 {still not really aware of tactical potential of black pieces} Nh5 7. h3 {I'm really annoyed by this bishop} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Qh4+ 9. Kd1 {now I can't castle} Ng3 10. Bxf4 Nxh1 {and I lose my rook.} 11. Kd2 Qf2+ 12. Qxf2 Nxf2 13. Rf1 Nxe4+ 14. Nxe4 {so...so far I'm one whole piece down, but have some active pieces. which I need to convert to winning advantage.the black king is in the centre and has weak defence} a6 {stopping Bb5} 15. Ng5 {targeting weak f7} Be7 {mistake} 16. Bxf7+ {check, besides winning a pawn, more importnantly this move makes sure that black king will stay in the centre which is crucial...} Kf8 17. Bd5 {attacking b7} Bxg5 18. Bxg5+ Ke8 {I can take b7, but I have better option} 19. Re1+ {rook check} Kd7 20. Re7+ {one more check, my rook will make some real trouble to 7th rank} Kd8 21. Rxg7+ {check again} Ke8 22. Rxc7 Rf8 {desperately trying to actviate pieces} 23. Re7+ Kd8 24. Rxb7+ Kc8 25. Rxh7 Nc6 {giving free night is of course better than whole free rook} 26. Bxc6 Rb8 27. b3 {not allowing any attacking chances to my opponent} Rg8 {this is mistake, which allows me to do little tactical operation} 28. Bd7+ {check} Kc7 29. Be6+ {check again, now black can't save g rook. here black resigned.}
