1. d4 {Because I know the e4 and d4 open I know the proper response according to what I learned from the 1960's when Fischer and Spassky were at it...} Nf6 {I like the Nimzo Attack by you know who. I also like King's Indian Defense. } 2. c4 {The usual for White. } e6 {I go for the NIMZO ATTACK instead of the King's Indian. Either will do. } 3. Nc3 {The usual. } Bb4 {The Nimzo Attack. I learned this as an attack and not a defense. I learned it in the 60's against White. Today they call it a Defense; however, in my days it was an attack. } 4. e3 {White is willing to suffer stacked pawns on "c" rank for the trade.  However, my bishop is still attacking and I can develop a pawn to the front to apply extra pressure without mercy. } d5 {This does not alleviate the NIMZO ATTACK. It can develop rapidly to complicate White. } 5. Bd3 {I want c7 to c5 anyway. It is the NIMZO ATTACK. Nothing here is changing this. } c5 {Now the Classical NIMZO ATTACK is in operation with my c5. } 6. Nge2 {He is clearing and defending house here; but the NIMZO ATTACK is on schedule. } cxd4 {His knight at c3 is useless. } 7. exd4 {A forthright pawn trade to diminish the NIMZO ATTACK. } dxc4 {It results in an isolated pawn for white} 8. Bxc4 {He should get his king 0-0'd. } O-O {I do mine first. } 9. O-O {He follows. } Nc6 {I am developing whilst seeing I may have to move my knight that just JUMPED out. } 10. a3 {Pressuring my bishop to another place....} Bd6 {If he wants to continue pushing my bishop let him do so...} 11. Bg5 {A good pin. } Bxh2+ {However....} 12. Kxh2 {His King......} Ng4+ {under attack by an unlikely piece while his bishop is out for grab. } 13. Kg3 {So I am ready to grab it. } Qxg5 {Disclosed check is here...} 14. f4 {Separating my Queen necessarily for now...} Qg6 {But still under disclosed check....} 15. f5 {An advance I can handle with a pawn...} exf5 {I have to use it...and defend the posted knight. } 16. Nf4 {I am thinking another pin is in the make...} Qd6 {So I do it. } 17. Nb5 {White is trying to unpin the pin...} Qb8 {The pin remains. } 18. d5 {White pushes a "passed pawn" to threaten...} Nce5 {I move my knight forward with my forward deployed knight. Together they are a lock. } 19. Be2 {In the lock the knights are fine. This move entices me to do what knights are famous for....} Ne3 {A fork between two more valuable pieces. } 20. Qc1 {He doesn't want to lose his queen for the rook. Should I take the rook?} Nxf1+ {No better thing to do no better move to make....} 21. Bxf1 {Recovering material for White. } g5 {I am doing the King Side attack now...} 22. d6 {That pawn isn't going anywhere.} gxf4+ {This pawn is. } 23. Qxf4 {My King has an open next window to White's Queen but my pawn has served to block that next move before} Ng6 {I close the window and attack while my bishop on c1 is still there to defend. } 24. Qh6 {An aggressive move made by a piece not in a position to really do much. } a6 {Time to push forward...} 25. Nc7 {He wants that rook I never moved...} Bd7 {He can have it if he wants. } 26. Be2 {?} f4+ {Continuing.} 27. Kf3 {His knight is still hesitating from the Book of Second Hesitations....} Qa7 {This should clear up hesitations....}
