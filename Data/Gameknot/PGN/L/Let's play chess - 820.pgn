Bd2 {...so his bishop contests the diagonal...} Bxd2 18. Rxd2 {...and we swap...} Rhe8 {...so I double up on the open file...} 19.

Rb1 {His rook attacks my b-pawn, meaning it can no longer be saved...} Nh5 {...so I move up my knight to line up an assault on the higher ranks...} 35. Rxb7+ {...and the rook removes my pawn, checking...} Kd6 {...forcing my king to expose my rook, so I move him on to a square next to it...} 36. Rxe7 Kxe7 {...allowing an exchange...} 37. Re2+ {...and his remaining rook attacks...} Kf6 {...so my king hides behind mine.} 38. Kg1 {He moves his king to avoid a knight fork...} Nf4 {...so I fork his rook and bishop...} 39.

Five consecutive knight moves, three of which checked, did eventually pressure him into a mistake, which allowed me to trap him.}
