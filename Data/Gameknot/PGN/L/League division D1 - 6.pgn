[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed"]

1. e4 {This game was very exciting. At each move I was looking forward to what my opponent would have done. I don't know if it is tactically brilliant; but it was exciting to explore the different tales which the chessboard could tell, depending on each move.} c5 2. Nc3 {The closed Sicilian is somehow not very popular. The Black can be comfortable, and probably the best line is 2. Nf3, or 2. c3; but it's a very sharp and extremely entertaining opening.} d6 3. d3 g6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. f4 e6 7. Nf3 Nge7 8. O-O O-O 9. Be3 {Classic position.} b6 {I was more used to 9. Nd4, 9. ... a6 and 9. ... Rb8. The point is probably to defend c5 in order to advance in d5, but the black must be careful with that diagonal. Seemingly this is a book move, so I won't protest about that.} 10. Qe1 {The queen might choose d2, however if the Black plays d5, he threatens d4, and one must think of a good position for the bishop. This might be d2. Moreover, I can choose to play: 10. ... d5 11. exd5 exd5 12. Bd2 Re8 13. Rf2 Nf5 14. Re2.} Ba6 {Unexpected. The bishop leaves the diagonal unguarded to pin the d-pawn. I would have played 10. ... d5.} 11. g4 {This might come somewhat unprepared, especially because the Black is about to play d5, and then there will be less chances to attack on the side. However, I needed a bit more space to maneuver, and I played Qe1 to use the e1-h4 diagonal, after all!} f5 {Is that fear I see in 11. ... f5? 11. ... d5 was to prefer.} 12. Ng5 Qd7 13. exf5 {Usually one takes with g. In this particular case, however, I couldn't wait to boast my bishop with a longer diagonal. The Nc6 is pinned.} gxf5 {I think that taking by e eliminates one weakness.} 14. Bd2 {I have no interest in taking in f5 at the moment. e6 is a more attractive target. It has become *the* target.} Nd4 {Well, this was truly unexpected. I thought the Nc6 was pinned.} 15. Bxa8 {The White shouts his skepticism to the Black's chances to checkmate before entering the endgame.} Rxa8 {15. ... Nxc2 16. Qxe6+ Qxe6 17. Nxe6 Rxa8 18. Rc1 is just about the same, but with some pieces swapping (not good for the Black).} 16. Rc1 Bb7 {Yes, the 10th move wasn't that great.} 17. Qg3 {The situation is getting complicated. It may be hard to believe, but the square e1 must be available for the KING! The big threat of the Black now is Dc6-g2#. From g3 the Queen controls g2. However, Qf2, which also controls g2, cannot be played, since the Black would threaten mate in h1.} b5 {The Black spotted another weakness: the e2 square, where the knight might fork the royal couple.} 18. Kf2 {Kf2! I thought this move deserved an exclamation mark when I played. The computer does not agree and proposes:  18. gxf5 Ndxf5 19. Qg4 Bd4+ 20. Rf2 Ng6 21. Re1 Re8 22. Nce4 Rf8 23. a4 Bxf2+ 24. Nxf2 e5 25. axb5 exf4 26. Bxf4 Nxf4 27. Qxf4 Qxb5  I don't know. For the moment Kf2 solves the problem of the fork, but even more importantly, it prepares Rg1. Without a counterattack, the Black is bound to open the lines and slaughter the white soldiers!} e5 {The computer is unhappy again: … h6 19. Nh3 Nf3 20. g5 hxg5 21. Be3 b4 22. Nd1 g4 23. Ng5 Nxg5 24. fxg5 Kf7 25. Bd2  The point of e5 is opening new lines. However, this might have been more effectively prepared with Rf8. You have to think that at each move the threats b4, Qc6, e5, d5, Rf8, must be accurately calculated... the risk is terribly high!} 19. gxf5 Nexf5 20. Qh3 {Pins the knight and poses an immediate threat to h7.} h6 21. Nge4 {The knight has found a strong square. The most important feature of the e4 outpost is that the Black must fear Nxc5, threatening the Queen.} Rf8 22. Rfg1 {Activity! The white king is boldly walking around, but two black pieces are pinned!} b4 23. Nd1 {The computer suggests 23. Nb1 exf4 24. c3 bxc3 25. Bxc3 Kh8 26. Qg4 Be5 27. Na3 Qe6 28. Qg6 Qxa2 29. Bxd4 Bxd4+  but I don't see the advantage of pointing to a3...} exf4 24. Bxf4 {Mabe this was too bold... 24. c3 was more precise -- but much less fun!! The white looks forward to freedom, but now it will be hard...} Qe6 {I had only considered 24. ... d5 and 24. ... Be4 (which I thought the best for the Black). Anyway, the Nf5 is free now. The threat is very simple: 24. ... Be4.} 25. Qg4 {Nf5 blocked once again!} Rf7 {The Black feared the worst. However, this was the time to open the lines with Bxe4. Now he will have to defend himself.} 26. c3 {Better late than never.} Nc6 {This is retreat. Bxe4 was still better, after all.} 27. Ne3 Nce7 {I actually feared 27. ... Ne5, to which I thought to reply 28. Bxe5 Nxe3+ (but also Qxe5) 29. Kxe3 Qxe5 threatening 30. ... d5.} 28. Nxd6 {All is lost for the Black.} h5 29. Qh3 Nd5 {After 29. … Nd4 30. Qxe6 Nxe6 31. Nxf7 Nxf4 the White is two qualities up anyway.} 30. Nxf7 Ndxe3 31. Nh6+ Kf8 32. Rxg7 {The White calls the last forces to arms.} Kxg7 {32. ... Nxg7 33. Qxe3 Qxe3+ 34. Kxe3 was probably better.} 33. Rg1+ Kf8 34. Bxe3 {The Black resigned. For me, it was a very beautiful and rewarding game.}
