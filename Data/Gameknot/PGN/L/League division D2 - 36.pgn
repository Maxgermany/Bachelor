1. Nf3 {I'm playing white, and this is my preferred opening at present.} d5 {This is the standard response} 2. c4 {Rather than D4, this immediately threatens to disrupt his centre.} dxc4 3. e3 b5 {He seems keen to hold onto his slim material advantage.} 4. b3 cxb3 5. Bxb5+ {No need to worry about the other pawn yet.} c6 6. Bc4 bxa2 7. Nc3 {There's no way he can save the pawn really, so there's no hurry to take it.} Nf6 8. Qb3 {Attacking f7.} e6 9. Rxa2 Qc7 10. O-O Nbd7 {I was hoping he'd do this as he's weakened his e pawn.} 11. Ng5 {I need back-up for my attack.} h6 {I could have backed off here, but thought it was worth going all out.} 12. Bxe6 fxe6 {He should have taken the knight there, now he's in trouble.} 13. Qxe6+ Be7 {King d8 loses, but then so does this!} 14. Qf7+ Kd8 15. Ne6# {very satisfying.}
