1. d4 {I play the Colle-system long ago. This is passive, but has poison if black makes a blunder.} Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. b3 Bg7 4. Bb2 d6 5. e3 O-O {Black played passiv and safe the opening.} 6. Bd3 Bg4 7. Nbd2 c5 8. dxc5 dxc5 9. O-O {The opening has ended. If black played g6, then after h3 has black no Bh5 and lost the pressure on the knight on f3.} Nc6 10. h3 Be6 {I think, the exchange is better. Now the pawn is blockade, too - so the center is mine and black has only control of it.} 11. a3 {Against a simple Nb4.} Qc7 12. Rb1 Rad8 13. Qe2 a6 14. Rfe1 Rd7 15. Nc4 Bxc4 16. bxc4 {This is a move, what I would never play, if I would no interested on adventures ways. Double pawn, my bishop is only a pawn now... So this cannot be a good move - strategical. But the b-file is mine.} Rfd8 17. Red1 e5 18. e4 {My bishop stands as a pawn. But the position is very safe.} Nd4 19. Nxd4 exd4 20. Bc1 Re7 21. Bg5 Rde8 22. f4 {This must be bad... I found only later. The rooks and the queen stand on the same colored place! Nxe4!!! And my position is ended. This was a blunder.} h6 23. Bxf6 Bxf6 24. e5 {I get more space and the bishop comes out to play. Now I must be better.} Bg7 25. Qf3 Rb8 26. Rde1 Qa5 27. Be4 b5 28. Bd5 {This bishop now the strongest piece on the board - not so was 3-4 moves ago :-)} Rc8 29. g4 Rb8 30. Ref1 b4 31. axb4 Rxb4 32. Rxb4 Qxb4 33. f5 {Now gxf5 would be better. But white is still better.} Bxe5 34. fxg6 Kg7 35. gxf7 Kf8 {Now black is over.} 36. Qf5 Qb8 37. Qh7 Bh2+ 38. Kh1 Be5 39. Qg8# {So I won - but I made a blunder. Anyway, this was a good game - and would be good, too, if I lost.  Thank You for the game v3kick! I will care much of the Knights in my next games.}
