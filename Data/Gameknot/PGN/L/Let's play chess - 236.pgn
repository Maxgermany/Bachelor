1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3 b5 7. Bb3 Bb7 8. a3 O-O 9. Nc3 d6 10. Re1 h6 11. Ne2 Re8 12. Ng3 Bf8 13. Nf5 {Rafael and I are off the database now.} Na5 {I wanted to see how much White wanted his Bishop.} 14. Ba2 c5 {Not having any better idea I decided to make some space for myself. I also don't like White's Bishop aimed at f7.} 15. b3 Bc8 {I'm thinking of putting my Bishop on e6. I also want to move my Knight back to b7.} 16. Nf3h4 Be6 17. b4 Bxa2 {I'm guessing that White will prefer to take my Bishop to my Knight, but if he takes my Knight... all the better.} 18. Rxa2 Nb7 19. c3 cxb4 {I'm not sure this was the best move, I was thinking of opening the c-File for my Rook...} 20. axb4 {...but now White has got a semi-open a-File and my Rook is stuck on guard duty.} d5 {I think I was hoping to weaken White's Pawns on b4, c3, d3 and e4 here. I also really don't like White's Knights on the Kingside. I am not good at defending a castled King, and White might be willing to take some damage to open up some lines of attack.} 21. f3 dxe4 22. fxe4 Kh7 {As Black I have had too many games where White was able to snatch my h-Pawn because my g-Pawn was pinned to my King on g8.} 23. Nf3 a5 {I'm hoping to reduce White's influence on the a-File.} 24. Be3 axb4 {I have no idea why I played this move, if I was playing this game over I would play 24. ... a4 instead, ten White would have to defend the a-File. Perhaps I wanted to exchange Rooks. I still think 24. ... a4 would have been better though.} 25. Qa1 bxc3 {This looks like another mistake by me. If I'd initiated an exchange of Rooks, White would at least have had to work harder to capture c3.} 26. Rxa8 Qxa8 27. Qxc3 Nd6 28. Ra1 Qc8 {I'd b happy to exchange Queens here...} 29. Qxc8 Rxc8 30. Nxe5 Rc7 {I've miscalculated somewhere, I don't want to lose f7 and having to defend it is a pain.} 31. Rb1 Nxf5 {This gives me a bit of breathing space, and I'm glad to get rid of one of White's Knights.} 32. exf5 b4 {Now my b-Pawn is covered by my Bishop, this won't be enough of course. White is likely to bring his own Bishop to bear on it.} 33. Bd2 Nd5 {This gives my b-Pawn another defender, and also allows me to play f6 at some point relieving my Rook from the need to defend it.} 34. g4 Nc3 {I wasn't sure how White would respond to this, but if he took my Knight my Pawn would just get closer to queening.} 35. Rc1 f6 {I'm not sure what I'd have done if White had played 36. Nc4} 36. Bxc3 Rxc3 {I'd be perfectly happy to exchange Rooks.} 37. Rb1 fxe5 38. Kf2 Rxd3 {}
