1. e4 d5 {Elephant Gambit? f3 is a move i hate because capturing the e pawn and recapturing creats a hole in kingside} 2. Bb5+ c6 3. Ba4 b5 {Queen side castling is bad for black} 4. Bb3 a5 {a4 makes the bishop trapped. i know that} 5. exd5 cxd5 6. Qh5 Nf6 {Queen attacked} 7. Qf3 Bg4 8. Qc3 a4 {forgot that threat, need to defend bishop, but i cant, best move i think is capturing the pawn to lose 2 points instead of 3} 9. Bxa4 Rxa4 10. d4 {Bishop has an open line} Ne4 11. Qb3 Qa5+ 12. Bd2 {Queen attacked} b4 13. Nf3 g5 {This is what i call a complicated position. Castling would be nice.} 14. Ne5 Bf5 15. O-O Qb5 {Even more complicated. Rook is defended by king} 16. f3 Nxd2 17. Nxd2 Bg7 {Black repaired the king side hole} 18. Ng4 Bxd4+ 19. Nf2 Be3 {Fork, but ones defended so its safe} 20. Qxe3 {oh ya and that too} Bxc2 21. Rfc1 Bf5 22. Qxg5 {Free pawn, fork if 22. Rc8} e6 23. Rc8+ Kd7 24. Rxh8 {Free rook, king is exposed, nearing the beginning of the endgame} Nc6 25. Qg8 Kd6 26. Qxf7 Ra7 {Rook defended} 27. Qf8+ Ke5 28. Ng4+ Kd4 29. Nb3+ {Checking spree is starting} Kd3 30. Nc1+ Kc2 31. Ne3+ Kxb2 {Fork!} 32. Nxf5 {Capturing the bishop is what i wanted to do the whole time!!!! I should win, but it was timed out.}
