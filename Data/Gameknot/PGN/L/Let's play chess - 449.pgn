[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Sicilian Rossolimo variation, the best thing about this variation from white’s point of view is that it tend not to be as forcing as some other Sicilian lines, so white can decide upon piece placement and long term positional plans.} Nf6 {from black's point of view the pressure over d4 is reduces by Bb5, as white can even exchange the bishop for the knight,  so we have a few possible choices here: a) 3...g6 so black can fiancheto the bishop and regain some pressure over d4 b) 3...e6 with the idea Nge7, if possible before the exchange of white's bishop, then Bb5 would lack it's point c) 3...d6 preparation of Bd7, after exchange Bxc6 Bxc6, black would exert pressure over e4 d) 3...a6 in my opinion a bad choice, as it loses one tempo so white can exchange and black could have developed a piece or opened some lines with a pawn advance, in this case just lost that oportunity e) 3...Qc7, also losing tempos with the queen not my first choice also f) 3...Nf6, is at the same time a solid choice but also a very fighting one, Richard Palliser, in His book "The Bb5 Sicilian" called this 3...Nf6 the fashionable line, due to several recent successful games with it, so this will be my choice for this game...} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {and now a bit of unusual play dxc6 instead of bxc6 (we all hear to capture towards the centre), but dxc6 allow an immediate release of the light squares bishop, plus with the alternative recapture bxc6 and the knight on f6 white can threaten it to gain some edge as was seen in Vescovi-Milos, São Paulo, 2002, black king would be vulnerable and white would get a great advantage} 5. d3 Qc7 {the queen controls the key square e5, Qc7 can also be done before 4.Bxc6, but then the capture would also be dxc6! as I said the purpose of Qc7 is to control e5...} 6. Bg5 {now this was a surprise, although limited in scope, white wanted to exchange both his bishops, as there was no pin behind Bg5} h6 {forces decision... although questionable, I have some doubts about this move... as if it wasn't for this move 7.Bxf6 gxf6 would have allowed Bh6, I also had some doubts about 7...gxf6 were would I castle after it?} 7. Bxf6 exf6 {with 6...h6 there is no point in gxf6, gxf6 would have weakened black king's wing for nothing, so now I need to castle and place my rooks on the semi open columns} 8. a4 {to prepare Nbd2-c4} Bd6 9. Nbd2 Be6 {now both castle options are open, and the bishops are centralized} 10. h3 {prevents Bg4... but there wasn't that option in my mind... I have the bishop pair and I'll stick to it, and playing Bg4 without at least the slight possibility of Bxf3 has no point...} O-O 11. O-O Rfe8 {here it is the first rook on a semi open column} 12. b3 {? this is a bad move it unnecessarily weakens the dark squares in white's field} f5 {no I'll grab the initiative an try to create some tension in the centre, my doubled pawns worth close to nothing will now be put to some gain, if exf5 would have allowed me a more open game for my bishops} 13. Re1 {nicely done to counter my rook} Rad8 {so now my second rook in a semi open column} 14. e5 Bf8 {now a new idea arises, from the need to relocate the bishop, lets try the main diagonal, and profit some from whites weakened dark squares on the queen's wing} 15. Qc1 {white has the same idea, to use the open dark square holes on his camp, but he is one tempo down} g5 {opened the diagonal for the bishop and controls f4} 16. Nc4 {now over protecting the e5 pawn and the idea Nd6 might be present} b6 {preventing any try against a5} 17. g3 {it balances control over f4 but the h3 pawn is now another weak spot in white's camp} Bg7 {now some tactics against the a1 rook can have place} 18. Qb2 {?? moving the queen in to the line of fire, is not a good idea, Nd6 is no longer possible, plus it loses a precious tempo in defence, several ideas to exploit here: a) 18...g4, to remove the defender Nf3, but 19.Nfd2 would call for 19...b5 20.axb5 cxb5, to remove yet other defender... b) 18...b4, better than the previous, as Ncd2 is a possibility removing an escape square for the f3 knight c) 18...Bxc4, I dislike the possibility if bxc4 opening a column for white's rooks d) 18...Bd5, is the best, because it attacks Nf3 at the same time opens the column for an attack by the rook on e5} Bd5 {and now the e pawn is lost for white} 19. Nd6 {late} Qxd6 {a temporary sacrifice to open the diagonal and recapture the queen a piece up, 19...Rxd6?? loses the rook and the queen and give white a pawn in the 7th  This was a nice little game, I was a bit surprised by 6.Bg5, and end up with a bit cramped position, with a bishop pair but seeing white manoeuvring his knights, finally the possibility to open some lines put white in trouble and forced a blunder, and thus my win.}
