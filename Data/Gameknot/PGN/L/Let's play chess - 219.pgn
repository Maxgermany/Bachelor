1. Nf3 {This game is annotated in an entertaining way, from white's point of view. Some remarks could be interesting to beginners / intermediate players.  Striking opening: 1. Nf3! Called the Reti opening in honor of chess player Richard Reti. Usually the plan is that whatever your opponent does, you push the g pawn, fianchetto the light square bishop, then castle. In this way your king is well protected from the beginning. It is considered defensive and not much used at top level. } d5 {1 ...d5 Classic reply to the Reti opening.} 2. g3 {Pushing the g pawn as scheduled.} Nc6 {Standard reply too.} 3. Bg2 {Fianchettoing the light square bishop as scheduled.} e5 {Oh, black is controlling the center now.} 4. d4 {Time to get dirty and go too!} e4 {Oh, he has a pawn on my side, and is threatening the knight.} 5. Ne5 {Let's escape to e5! What do you think of this outpost?} Bd6 {What? Help, he's chasing my knight! I can protect him with the dark square bishop, or... } 6. Nxc6 {That's it, let's take the knight. OK mine moved three times and his only one, but...} bxc6 {He has to alter his pawn structure to recapture. So, in terms of imbalances, so far I lost some tempos and he has an altered pawn structure.} 7. c4 {OK now let's advance the c pawn to go to c5, if he captures, he will have a very bad pawn structure (three pawns on the same file, that can be good in some situations but here I'm not too sure), plus I can take the e pawn with the bishop.} Be6 {OK he doesn't take and develops his bishop, defending the d pawn.} 8. c5 {So let's advance inside his side too, and attack his other bishop at the same time!} Be7 {He has to retreat.} 9. Qa4 {The c6 pawn is vulnerable, so let's threaten it. It's also interesting to have a diagonal targeting the adverse king.} Qd7 {He choses to defend with the queen.} 10. f3 {It would be good to get rid of this e4 pawn, who has already well walked. If he takes I recapture with the e pawn, creating a semi open e file for a future rook. Otherwise I just take with the f pawn, creating a semi open f file for a future rook.} Nf6 {Hmmm he choses to defend the e pawn by developing the knight. The problem is now, if I take, he will have a powerful knight on e4, defended by the d pawn.} 11. Bg5 {I think it's worth sacrificing the bishop to kill the knight. He's defending d5 and e4, and he's well positioned if black decides to castle kingside.} O-O {Well, black just castles kingside.} 12. Bxf6 {So... so long for keeping the bishop pair, bye bye Mr Knight. Say hello to Keat.} Bxf6 {Wisely, he recaptures with his bishop and not with the g pawn.} 13. fxe4 {Now I can go with the initial idea and take the e pawn. } dxe4 {He recaptures, and I will be able to take with the bishop. But wait! Now he has two attackers targeting my d pawn, who is only protected by my queen! If he takes the d pawn, he will furthermore take the c pawn and destroy my center.} 14. e3 {I prefer to build a solid diagonal spine of three pawns. The e pawn is not defended, but it's not threatened so far.} Bd5 {Of course he defends the e4 pawn, and now he also has a strong diagonal spine, with the bishop defending both extreme pawns.} 15. Nc3 {His e pawn is still here, invading my side. My turn to develop a second piece threatening him.} Qe6 {He moves his queen to defend e4. At this point my impression is that the game is a bit stuck. The opening is over, we're in the midgame. Someone has to take the initiative.} 16. h4 {This move is probably not very good. The plan is to move on towards the black g and h pawns defending the king. On the other hand, my queen is a bit isolated on the a4 square, I should think of a way to put her back in the game... maybe Qd1? Trading my knight against his bishop is tempting, but the drawback is that it would reorganize his pawn structure.} Qg4 {Damn, the black queen has taken advantage of the previous move. She threatens the g pawn now. Too late to bring back the white queen. } 17. Ne2 {So far, I have no real plan to attack, and the only thing I see to defend the pawn is to bring the knight to e2. I have considered Kf2 too, but after something like Qf5 I wouldn't know what to do. } a5 {Now he plays on the queen side. It's likely I won't castle kingside, and he has a semi open file (b). On the other hand, I notice that his queen is a bit constrained, can we trap her somehow? If Bh3, her only free squares are h5 and g6. How to control them?} 18. Kf2 {Commiting move, as I cannot castle anymore. The idea is that now it is the king who will protect g3, so I can bring the knight to f4 and control g6 and h5!} Rfb8 {He attacks the b2 pawn, threatening to arrive on the second rank.} 19. Qc2 {Opportunity to move the queen towards the active side of the game, defending the b pawn.} Rb4 {He goes in. This is unpleasant, the rook is threatening to attack the queen by going to c4, I have to do something.} 20. b3 {Defending a4 and c4.} Rab8 {He doubles the rooks, threatening the poor b3 even more. I decide not to care and go on with the trapping plan. } 21. Nf4 {OK knight moved to b4, good. But... the super plan doesn't work! If Bh3 then Qf3+. } a4 {So black has now 4 attackers targeting b3. One can see that if the b8 rook ever leaves its rank, I may be able to backrank-checkmate him. } 22. Rhb1 {So let's play Rhb1 with the strange idea: axb3 axb3 Bxb3 Rxb3 Qxb3. If Rxb3 then Ra8+ Qc8 Rxc8+ Bd8 Rxd8++!} h6 {Ooooooh he saw that and created an escape square for his king. No way! But wait, something appears: his e4 square is not defended anymore by the queen because the knight is now blocking the path. So...} 23. Bxe4 {This move attacks the h7 square blocking the king's exit... At the same time there is still a b-plan to trap the queen with Bf5! It didn't work from the front, let's try from the back (sentence not to take out of context).} axb3 {OK he takes the b3 pawn. He could have taken the bishop as well.} 24. axb3 {I recapture, the a file is now open! Ready to sacrifice the queen for a backrank mate.} Bxb3 {He still decides not to take the bishop and takes the pawn instead, threatening the queen. But it is a free bishop for me since after Rxb3, if Rxb3 then Qxb3.} 25. Rxb3 {OK I capture the free bishop with the rook.} Rb4xb3 {And he recaptures. Here I have also considered Bf5 as mentioned earlier, but the problem is: Rb2 Qxb2 Rxb2+ checks the white king, so no time to bring the remaining white rook to a8...} 26. Qxb3 {This leaves us with Qxb3, not so bad. If Rxb3 then Ra8+ leading to mate, and if he doesn't retreat the queen Bf5 is still trapping her. And I'm up materialwise.} Qc8 {This is probably the best move he could have played, at the same time defending the rook and saving the queen from being trapped.} 27. Bf5 {Let's carry on attacking the queen.} Qd8 {He retreats. Now his rook is a threat to my queen as my rook can't go to the 8th rank anymore. } 28. Qc4 {So let's move away.} Rb2+ {The rook finally leaves the 8th rank, protected by the queen, to check my king. Not a big issue. } 29. Kg1 {King is pretty safe here.} g5 {He attacks my knight with his g pawn. I think this is a mistake, as g7 is now empty.} 30. Bh7+ {Let's go closer to the adverse king. If Kxh7 then Qxf7+ (taking advantage of the empty g7 pawn) which puts the king in a very uncomfortable situation.} Kg7 {He doesn't take and goes to g8. f8 was a better square, as I can now advance the knight and check him at the same time.} 31. Nh5+ {Threats are too strong now, and I think that he doesn't have any real plan. He resigns.}
