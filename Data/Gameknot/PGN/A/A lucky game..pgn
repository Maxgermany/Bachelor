Nc3 a6 {All my pieces are developed.} 10. a3 c5 11. Bd3 Bxd3 12. Qxd3 c4 {Now I got a good chain.} 13. Qe2 Qa5 {A trick if he castles to the queen side.} 14. O-O-O {I guess he did not see the move, here it is.} Bxa3 {I win a pawn with a mate attack.} 15. bxa3 Qxc3 16. Qf3 Qxa3+ {2 pawns actually.} 17.

Kb1 {Te same blunder.} c3 {And he resinged with no defence for the upcoming mate next move. Thank you for watching! }
