1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez.  An opening I often choose as White, with normally plenty of tactical goings-on.} a6 {Not my usual choice of reply as I prefer to push my own development first with something like Nf6 (Berlin Defence) or Bc6 (Cordel or Classical Defence).  But 3. ... a6 is a popular choice, and while it seems a little slow and often-seen continuation Ba4 b5 Bb3 isn't very good for Black in my experience, a6 on its own is fine. } 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {Ordinarily I'd capture towards the centre with bxc6.  This option gives Black the opportunity to more quickly develop, at the expense of a decent pawn centre.  Perhaps not worth it.} 5. d3 f6 6. a3 {? White is making some slow pawn moves that aren't doing much.} Bg4 {A sort of reverse Ruy Lopez (I don't know if this has a real name).  Black can easily be chased away into obscurity by h3, but for now the knight is pinned.} 7. Be3 g6 {Prepares f5 to supposrt the bishop, which would force the exchange if White plays h3.  Perhaps this whole idea is weak.} 8. Nc3 {A fairly limited square for the knight, who is dominated by the c6 pawn.  I think Nfd2 might have been better, with castling, central pawn pushes and support from the Queen to follow.} Bc5 {??} 9. Bxc5 f5 {I don't think I like this too much either.  I suppose after Bxf3 Qxf3 f4 the White queen is a little trapped, but the king's castle will be very exposed (assuming he gets rid of that dsb long enough to make one).} 10. O-O Nf6 {I don't really know where he thinks he's going.} 11. exf5 gxf5 12. Qe2 b6 {An empty threat: Qxe5+ buys enough time for the bishop to move away. } 13. Be3 Rg8 {Black eyes a sneaky checkmate should the queen leave her defence of the knight.  Seems a vain hope now, though.  Might have been better to get the Queen out in preparation for castling long.} 14. h3 {Drops the pawn.} Bxh3 15. Bg5 Bg4 16. Bxf6 Qxf6 {Black survives a short tactical storm with a one-pawn advantage, but how long can he hold it? } 17. Rae1 {Qxe5 probably recovers the pawn (continuing Qxe5 18. Nxe5.  18. ... Bh3 appears to win it back until 19. Kh2 Bxg2 20. Rg1 and Black is in trouble). } Bh3 {I don't know, really.  It looks like Black hopes to win something back by exploiting pins and discovered attacks, but he hasn't enough material or power in the attack to really make it stick and White has many defenders around. } 18. Qxe5+ Qxe5 19. Rxe5+ {White trades Queens and picks up a pawn into the bargain.  His position looks good if he can turn his minor piece advantage into a workable pawn majority. } Kd7 20. Nh4 Rg4 {?! Doesn't really improve Black's position, but it doesn't appear to drop a pawn either (which I thought it might).  Might work out well if Black gets the time to bring his other rook over, or if White plays Nxf5} 21. Re3 Rxh4 {Anything else for Black is worse.} 22. Rxh3 Rxh3 23. gxh3 {Black is hanging on but isn't improving his position and isn't likely to be happy if pieces keep getting traded down.} Rg8+ 24. Kh2 Re8 {Looking to dominate an open file and sneak onto the seventh, from where he should win a pawn, but only if the knight shifts first, which he probably will have to given the lack of other options.} 25. Kg3 Rg8+ {Black must move his rook before he can move his king across the e-file.  Perhaps he should abandon that pawn to distract White while he works on moving over to the Queenside?} 26. Kf4 Ke6 27. Ne2 {Heading for a fork on d4} c5 28. c4 c6 29. b4 cxb4 30. axb4 {White now cannot prevent Black from making an outside passed pawn, but will Black be able to turn it into something useful?  It seems likely White's defenders will be equal to the task of containing it.} a5 31. bxa5 bxa5 32. Nc3 Rb8 {Black hopes to pick up other pawns while the Knight goes after the passed pawn, using the open file to penetrate White's position. } 33. Ra1 Rb2 34. Rxa5 Rxf2+ {Black has traded his passed pawn for a pawn of White's.  Not a great position for Black, but he does now have a passed pawn he might be able to support with his king.} 35. Kg3 Rd2 {The d-pawn must fall as well - the h-pawn would have fallen had the king tried to protect the d-pawn. } 36. Na4 Rxd3+ 37. Kg2 {The White king chooses to move backwards rather than be pushed to the edge of the board.  Instead Kf4 would have kept him in the central fight.  He is now entombed behind the third rank and will need his other pieces to get active to hold off the advancing e-pawn. } Ra3 38. h4 {As mentioned, Nc5+ and White has won.} Kf6 39. Ra6 {? White's rook's control of the sixth rank was vital.  This is a potentially huge mistake.  On the other hand, it may allow White to pull a win out of a drawn position. } Ke5 40. Ra7 h5 {Robs the White rook, if it does go after the pawn, of valuable checking distance.  If White wants that pawn, he has to give up tempi that allow Black to further threaten promotion.} 41. Re7+ Kd4 {Black opts not to block his pawn.  He can protect it from where he is, and can potentially snap up the c-pawn and make another passed pawn for himself.  Black isn't too worried about facing a flurry of White checks and should eventually penetrate the White position.} 42. Nb6 {White saves his knight and protects his c-pawn, but gives Black the chance to push his f-pawn a little harder.  The position still looks quite drawn, but the major winning chances are with Black.} f4 43. Rh7 f3+ 44. Kf2 Ke4 {The White king gets himself in front of the pawn, which is good, but the pawn is now protected by its king, which will allow Black to use his rook to push the king back.  43. Rh7 was not a particularly good move as it gave too much freedom to the Black king.  White has slipped a little out of the drawn position, and must accept that the game is very locked down (unless he can trade rooks and win the advanced pawn, when his knight might allow him to free one of the remaining pawns).} 45. Rxh5 {? Not good.  Checking distance is gone and the White rook has wasted a move.  The position really does still look very drawn to me, but White is making problems for himself rather than playing simply and containing the threat.} Ra2+ {Perhaps not.  White still has good defences here if he plays well, and good chances to perhaps sneak a win if he can trade rooks and then use his knight.  Black should perhaps play for the draw with Ra3-Rb3-Ra3 and so on. 46} 46. Kf1 {Kg3 instead kept the king active and competitive.  Here he is massively trapped. } Ke3 {Black creates a mate in one, but in this position the king is exposed to checks from the rook which can easily keep him immobile or drive him from the mating squares.  After Re5+, Black will have to give up his advanced pawn to keep the White hoards at bay, and the game should probably still be a draw, but with the chances now mostly with White.} 47. Rf5 {?? Concedes mate in one.  The intention isn't obvious either since the rook can't win the pawn without giving itself up} Ra1# {}
