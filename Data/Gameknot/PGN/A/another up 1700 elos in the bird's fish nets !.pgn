1. f4 {bird} e5 {most aggressive defence against bird (according to my experience me) , most often plaid by hight elo players} 2. fxe5 {the best solution in my opinion, but then the situation is not comfortable for white. This is the risk with e4 ...} d6 {what you should not play is exd6 ! then he take back with the dsb and the way for a killer attack with the queen on h5 is done ...} 3. Nf3 {this is the best answer, but the situation is still very uncomfortable ..} Bg4 4. e4 {to develop lsb on e2} Nc6 5. Be2 {the e5 pawn is anyway sacrificed} Bxf3 6. Bxf3 {now an attack on h5 could be refuted} Qh4+ 7. g3 {that ' s all, no more danger. this attack is too early and give me a chance to castle (even if the castle is now weak} Qd8 {ouf ! i have a free tempo} 8. O-O Nxe5 9. c3 {knight take lsb, i retake with the rook and place my queen on b3 threatening mate on f7...} Nf6 10. d4 {forcing the exchange even if my plans are are no longer current} Nxf3+ 11. Rxf3 Be7 12. Bg5 {if knight x e4, my dsb x e7 threatening the black queen, then i place my rook in e3 and intent to win the back knight} Nxe4 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. Re3 {that was the plan, but you know, this is a 3mn blitz, so i had to think quickly and i'm not sure about the suitability of it} d5 {that was expected, i will play Nd2} 15. Nd2 O-O {so the result of my plan is that i'm 1 pawn less, and a very weak situation in king side. great ! at this moment i'm not expecting any victory ...} 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Qe2 {wining the pawn ?} f5 {of course not !} 18. Rf1 Rae8 {i will intent my last plan's chance : attacking black castle placing my rook in h4, but i don't believe it will win ..} 19. Rf4 Kh8 20. Rh4 {i didnt saw the dangerous advancing g pawn ...} Qf7 {preventing Qh5} 21. Qg2 g5 {surprise ! am i going to loose my rook ? not !} 22. Rh3 {that's all. if g pawn advance, i go back to h4 and there is no thing more to kill my rook apart another rook, what would be just an exchange.} Rfg8 23. Qe2 {in case of f pawn advance} f4 {very tight game} 24. Rxe4 f3 25. Qe3 {so dangerous pawn, most of the time i loose with good player is a question of pawns !} Rxe4 26. Qxe4 {i have a secret weapon for what follows...} f2+ {of course, } 27. Kf1 {the only response} Re8 {so this is the black plan ! Ans i had found the emergency exit : Rxh7!} 28. Rxh7+ {here we are, that was the wining white move. so what would you play there if you where blacks ?} Kg8 29. Rxf7 Rxe4 30. Rxc7 {and i win at least 2 pawns. then the situation will be clearly in my advantage, see it ....} Re1+ 31. Kxf2 {the dangerous pawn is dead} Ra1 32. Rxb7 Rxa2 {so now i'm +3 and my king can come into the fight easily while black king is blocked on 8th line. so black resign.}
