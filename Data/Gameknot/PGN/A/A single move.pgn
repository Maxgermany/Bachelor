1. e4 {E4 is a strong but common move.} Nf6 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 {A lot of the time your board will look like this} e5 4. Bb5 {A not-so great move} Bb4 {He mirrors him, trying to distract him} 5. a3 Bxc3 {Now the pawn is defenceless} 6. dxc3 Nxe4 7. g4 {He tries to capture one side of the board} Qg5 {Why on earth would you make that move!!!!!!???????} 8. Bxg5 Nxg5 {The match has turned around completely } 9. Nxg5 Nd4 {A clumsy attempt to capture the bishop} 10. cxd4 exd4 11. Qxd4 {Now the board is owned by white} c6 {Black sees the danger his king is in} 12. Qxg7 {Bang! But he would of had time for that later} Rf8 {? Well I guess it was an ideal move} 13. Nxh7 {White sees no danger in this move} cxb5 {A blind and stupid move which cost him the match} 14. Qxf8# {Checkmate. That is how a match can be turned around in a single, dumb move. Never underestimate anyone. I made that mistake against someone 200 rating points below me but he beat me quite easily. This wasn't a real match.}
