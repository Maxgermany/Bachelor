1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - this pawn trade is almost always standard in the Sicilian.} Nf6 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3 - defends e4 pawn.} a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nf3 {7. Nf3 - I have usually played Nb3 here but for a change I decided to move my steed back to f3.} Qc7 8. a4 Be7 {8. .... Be7 - good, sound development by Paul.} 9. a5 Nc6 10. Bb6 {10.  Bb6 - a good placement for Fou Lenoir but alas it doesn't achieve much here.} Qd7 11. Nd2 {11. Nd2 - bolsters e4.} d5 12. exd5 Nxd5 13. Nxd5 Qxd5 {13. ...... Qxd5 - after a plethora of exchanges, the Wicked Witch of the West is handily placed in the centre.} 14. Nc4 Qxd1+ 15. Rxd1 {15. Rxd1 - queen trade.} Be6 16. c3 O-O 17. Be2 {17. Be2 - clearing the way for kingside castling.} e4 18. O-O {18. 0-0 - although Henry does castle kingside he will soon find himself over to the queenside.} Bd8 19. Bxd8 Raxd8 {20. b4 - in anticipation of a rook trade I back up my advanced a5 pawn.} 20. b4 Rxd1 21. Rxd1 Rd8 22. Rxd8+ Nxd8 {22. ...... Nxd8 - another plethora of exchanges ensues and we are now in an endgame.  Black is not badly placed here and I am in for a long hard haul and the possibility of a Low Draw looms on the horizon.} 23. Nb6 {23. Nb6 - this knight replaces Fou Lenoir on b6 but how effective is this placement gonna be only time will tell.} Nc6 24. Kf1 {24. Kf1 - Henry begins his trek over to the queenside.} Ne5 25. Ke1 f5 {25. ...... f5 - Paul's kingside pawn majority is beginning to look ominous.} 26. h3 Kf7 27. Kd2 Ke7 28. Ke3 {28. Ke3 - both King Henry and King Paul wend their way to the centre of the board.} Kd6 29. h4 {29. h4 - holding back g5.} g6 30. g3 h6 31. Kf4 Nf7 {31. ...... Nf7 - both sides scratch around.} 32. f3 exf3 33. Bxf3 {33. Bxf3 - Fou Leblanc hits at the b7 pawn.} Nd8 34. Ke3 {34. Ke3 - Paul defends the pawn so I am still scratching around!} Nc6 35. Na4 Bd5 36. Nc5 {36. Nc5 - still scratching around but at least I am keeping up the pressure on b7.} Ne5 {36. ...... Ne5? Paul makes his first error here, this move is gonna cost him a pawn.  I decided to trade bishops before taking off the b pawn.} 37. Bxd5 Kxd5 38. Nxb7 {38. Nxb7 - b7 pawn extinct but not his kingside pawn majority alas!} Kc4 39. Kd2 {39. Kd2 - Henry must back-peddle to defend c3.} f4 40. gxf4 Nf3+ 41. Kc2 Nxh4 {41. ..... Nxh4 - still a pawn up but now Paul has an outside passed pawn.  This is certainly a Battle of the Wings Part 2.  I now have a counter-attack however and that black a6 pawn will soon be white horse-fodder!} 42. Nc5 Kb5 43. Kb3 Nf5 {43. ..... Nf5 - clearing the line for his h pawn to advance.  I now play the only move that keeps me in the game .......} 44. c4+ {44. c4+! - this move forces King Paul away from the protection of his a6 pawn.} Kc6 45. Nxa6 {45. Nxa6 - suddenly I now have 3 connected passers on the queenside with the a5 pawn just 3 squares away from Glendadom once my knight shifts himself out of the way.} h5 46. b5+ Kb7 47. c5 {47. c5 - the wall advances.} Nd4+ 48. Kc4 {48. Kc4 - Henry keeps in touch with his footmen.} Nc6 49. bxc6+ Kxa6 {49. ...... Kxa6 - now we are in a K & P ending and Henry now makes the winning move to d5.} 50. Kd5 h4 51. c7 {51. c7 - here Paul resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  I say Unavoidable Mate because if Paul now plays Kb7 I will play Kd6.  If now h3 I will play a6+ and if Kxa6 then c8/Q with mate to follow shortly.  If Paul does not play Kxa6 but plays Kc8 then I will play a7 and my pawn will crown one move before his and deliver mate.  At one point I thought I was gonna have to kiss 19 rating points goodbye but thankfully I survived.  Paul, you gave me more than a run for my money - you went into an endgame with even material and an even position (so that will be good endgame experience for you against much higher rated oppo) and at one stage you looked like you might steal a win so you can hold your head up high here.}
