1. e4 {I am actually not going to annotate this entire game. I am a bit sick lately and more sick because I just lost a game I should have won had it not been for my lack of seriousness at the end, and my telling myself "don't worry there is not checkmate he can pull on you for now". I do not think the game is necessarily eventful in any particular way until about move 25 or so. Both my opponent and I make decent moves as well as mistakes and blunders along the way. It is my big blunder at the end that I hope offers some lessons to some poor soul out there. } b6 2. Nc3 {Vienna game. } Bb7 3. Nf3 e6 4. d4 Bb4 5. Bd2 Nf6 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. a3 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 {At this point I see nothing special about the set up and do not feel black is anything for me to worry about. I do not feel reckless or fool hardy either, just feel the game is about even. } d5 9. e5 Ng4 {I always chase of knights or bishops poised in this position. } 10. h3 Nh6 11. O-O O-O {Both castled. Inching long. } 12. Bd2 Nf5 13. Bg5 Qd7 14. c3 h6 15. Bf4 a6 16. b4 b5 17. Bxf5 {Seems we both make a mistake here. I take his knight... } a5 {and he does not take my bishop. Yet I neglect to move it. } 18. Qd2 {I move my queen instead. I notice my blunder and figure that is it. } Ne7 {But instead of taking with his pawn (maybe he did not want to) he attacks with his knight, and finally I move my bishop. } 19. Bd3 {So it is to be a slightly spacey game on both our parts it seems. } Nf5 20. Bxf5 exf5 {Finally takes it with the pawn. } 21. Bxh6 gxh6 22. Qxh6 {I feel things move into my favor a bit with this reckless play. } Ra6 23. Qh5 f6 24. Qg6+ Kh8 25. Nh4 Qh7 {I do the queen trade off at this point. } 26. Qxh7+ Kxh7 {Sometime prefer to leave pawns doubled up but I take the pawn on F5. } 27. Nxf5 Bc8 28. Ne3 fxe5 29. dxe5 Re6 30. Ng4 Rg6 31. Rad1 Rfg8 32. Nf6+ { A decent play here on my part wins me a rook. And here is where I just assume I have the game eventually. I have found that at times when I am playing "better" I rarely consider any game as had. } Rxf6 33. exf6 Kg6 34. Rxd5 Kxf6 35. Rxb5 {Here is where I blow it. I know he is going to take my pawn on H3. But I feel like I am in one of those games on Youtube now, and the commenter goes "But Courtney dismisses the pawn and allows the foolish Bobby Fischer to fall into his trap." I figure I will be okay, that him checkmating me is all but impossible. Really, that is my thinking at this point. I will take the other pawn and advance my pawns and promote one or maybe two of them. I feel I have the advantage of a soon to be promoted pawn on my side. } Bxh3 36. bxa5 Rxg2+ {Saw this coming (or the bishop to G2) but am not concerned. Figure I will move my rook out. But a some time goes by before the enxt move and I sort of forget about the game in away. After unchecking my king I forget about how good repositioning my rook seemed earlier in the day, or the day before. } 37. Kh1 Rg7 38. Rg1 Rh7 {My thinking here here is to get my rook off of the white square so he cannot take it during hidden check. But I am facing mate on the very next move. } 39. Rb8 Ke7 {He must have missed the mate here too for one move. } 40. a6 {I sure did, and begin my pawn promotion plans. But... } Bf1# {BA-BOOM! So sweet and simple really. Sweeter had I been the doer rather than the doee. All I had to do earlier was either move my king to H2 (maybe resulting in a draw by repetition) or moved my rook to any of the dark squares to the left. I was even given a one move reprieve and still missed it. A lesson here in letting our paranoia and sense of danger get neglected. You could say "well as long as you learned something it was worth it" but I feel I will probably do stupider things in the future. In my defense I have the flu and am playing on cold medicine despite telling myself to take some time off from games and methinks therein lies the roots of my true folly. GG to sanjip. }
