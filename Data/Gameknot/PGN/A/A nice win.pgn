1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 f5 3. Bf4 Nf6 4. h3 d5 5. e3 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Nbd2 Be7 8. Ne5 O-O 9. g4 fxg4 10. hxg4 Nxe5 11. dxe5 Nd7 12. Qc2 g6 {Bd3 threats at once a deadly Bxg6.} 13. Nf3 Qc7 14. Bd3 Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Bd6 {Ah, looking to recovering some material... but...} 16. Bxg6 Rf6 {Well played.} 17. Bxh7+ Kf8 18. Ng6+ Ke8 19. Bg5 {It seems incredible that with that amount of pieces I have no mate... but it is the truth.} Rxf2 {VERY smart. If QxR, Bg3 loses the queen. It could have been a possibility, though.} 20. Qd3 {If c4, Qd4, e5... Qxd5. } Bg3 {Scaring, isn't it? but...} 21. O-O-O {Oooops. Now what can do black?} Kd7 {Nf8+ doesn't seem deadly, so I tried...} 22. Bg8 Kc6 {Here, Rh7 leads to Qa5... } 23. Nf4 Qb6 {Threatening mate. b3, Rxa2, so...} 24. Rd2 Rxd2 25. Qxd2 {Pityfully, I have to take it with the queen, or Qxb2+. } Bxf4 {The simple choice was exB, joining the pawns, but... } 26. Bxf4 {Pressure around the king, and e4 to get to the center. } Bd7 {The wise one is Bf7, but I didn't want to lose the attack. } 27. c4 {Inviting to...} Rxg8 28. cxd5+ {Ah, but now he cannot take exd, because of Rh6+...} Kb5 {The less worse one. Again, the pawn gives me nothing, so...} 29. Qd3+ {If c4, a4+, Kxa4, Qa3+, Kb4... not deadly, but wild. But black half-blundered.} Ka5 30. e4 {Opened the way to my bishop, the game is over. The queen must have retired to give some air to the king: Qd8, Bd2+, Kg6, Qb3+, Kc7. But...} Bb5 31. Bd2+ Ka6 32. Qa3+ {And mate the next one. After so many silly defeats, a nice win, at last (with a good opponent)...}
