1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Bb6 5. d4 {Book play through here, standard Giuoco Piano.} Qe7 {A variant.} 6. d5 {Not good. It closes the diagonal of the White KB and opens the diagonal of Black's.} Nd8 {Pretty much forced.} 7. Be2 {7 O-O is much better. The B was fine where it was and White needed to think about finding shelter for the K.} d6 {Opening a line for the QB.} 8. h3 {Losing more time. Again 8 O-O was the right move.} f5 {Looking to exploit White's nerveless play by opening the game up.} 9. Bg5 {A wasted move, as Black has...} Nf6 {...this natural developing move in response.} 10. Nbd2 {Guarding the KP.} O-O {Notice that Black *immediately* castles as soon as he gets the opportunity. Now he can go on the attack safely.} 11. Nh4 {Missing his last chance to castkle.} fxe4 {Initiating a powerful attack.} 12. Nxe4 {The natural recapture. But...} Nxe4 {White can lose quickly or slowly. If he does not take the Q he is behind 2 pieces [after 13... QxB or ...QxN]. If he does...} 13. Bxe7 {...like so...} Bxf2+ {...he is mated at once.} 14. Kf1 {Forced.} Ng3# {And a wonderful finish!}
