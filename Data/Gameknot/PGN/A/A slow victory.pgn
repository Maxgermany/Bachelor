1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Bf5 3. Nd2 c6 4. c3 h6 5. Ngf3 e6 6. e3 Nf6 {This looks boringly symmetrical. Let's see.} 7. h3 Bd6 8. Ne5 O-O 9. g4 {Here I go with a "normal" London attack.} Be4 {This gives me the opportunity to exchange his good bishop. Bh7 could have been better.} 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. h4 {Necessary move to avoid his Q's incursion on h4. This is all theory in "my" book.} Nd7 {If f6, I won't be sure about Ng6.  } 12. Bd3 {I plan to exchange this N and then try to support g5, while his response h5 won't be possible due to Qxh5.} Nxe5 13. dxe5 {He didn't expect this move, since he spent more than one minute on his response.} Be7 {The move is correct, since I can't protect my h4 pawn but moving it to h5. But this meant to forget about the possibility of a future g5 break, so I decided to counterattack.} 14. Bxe4 dxe4 15. Qc2 {Now e4 is hanging. If f5, exf6 (ep) and my dsb comes alive.} Qd3 {Oh, well, this means this will be a slow endgame. But his advanced pawn will make him suffer. He won't be able to retain it. } 16. Qxd3 exd3 17. Kd2 Rfd8 {Of course I won't be able to take it soon, but he will lose it eventually.} 18. Rag1 {Pressing on the kingside, planning g5. The attack has no sense, since now it is not dangerous. This move is not good, since he will be able to attack my queenside very soon.} c5 {Trying to consolidate his d3 pawn, but...} 19. c4 {This is what I have planned. Now his dsb is as blind as mine.} a6 {b5 was more straight. If I defend c4 with b3, after the exchange he can grab the semiopen column, to his good. b3 is not an optimal response for the same reason. } 20. g5 {Let's push it.} hxg5 21. hxg5 {Now you see my dsb as a "big pawn". But his is no better. His best plan was to play Rd7, Bd8 in view of Ba5+, and I would have a hard time defending it. But he didn't.} b5 22. Rgc1 {It is better to leave the phantom of an attack on the h column (I have no time to double the rooks on the h column... do I?)} Rab8 23. b3 bxc4 24. Rxc4 {My R has good prospects here, e.g. Ra4. of course, bxc4 would have been a mistake due to Rb2+.} Rb4 {This was probably the losing move. } 25. Rxb4 cxb4 {His dsb is still blocked by his own pawn (now, more than before, since a5 is useless for it).} 26. Rc1 {...and I grab the c column. Right now, I threat Rc7, followed by Ra7, winning a pawn. Which, in this kind of positions, is very important.} Rd5 {Now the Rc7 plan fails: Bc8, Ra7, a5 and his pawn is defended. I am considering e4 at some point, but I kept it for later. I can go after the f7 pawn.} 27. Rc8+ Kh7 28. Rc7 Bd8 29. Rxf7 {First pawn to fall. As you can see, this is a slow game, just the kind of game I have to play to improve my chess (if it would still be possible!).} Kg6 {Now he threats in return the g5 pawn, which I can't defend because I have to take care of my R. But...} 30. Ra7 {Well, now if Bxg5, BxB, KxB, and Rxg7. So...} a5 {This is ok, but leaves another weak pawn into black camp.} 31. Ra6 Kf7 {Now I repeated the position to grab some seconds. } 32. Ra7+ Kg6 33. Ra6 Kf7 34. Rd6 {g6+, Kxg6 and Rxd6+ was probably good, but I said I would have won the d3 pawn, and this is the way.} g6 {Black can't avoid the following sequence.} 35. Rxd5 exd5 36. Kxd3 Ke6 37. Kd4 Bb6+ {I have now two pawns, but it is still a technical job to do in order to win. My K has no way of getting into his side of the board.} 38. Kd3 Bc7 {Kd4 leads a repetition, so I have to risk something. A pawn. } 39. Bg3 Bd8 {Bxe4 should have been his best choice. I have no idea about the right manouver to win this, but I sensed that without a pawn sacrifice it would have been a dead drawn. Not with 2 pawns!} 40. f4 Bb6 41. e4 {Do you remember the e4 strike? Well, now is the moment. If d4, Bf2 and I win the pawn. } dxe4+ 42. Kxe4 Bc5 {Still hard to break in. } 43. Be1 {The plan is Bd2-e3 and exchange it. } Bb6 44. Bd2 Ba7 45. Kd3 {...but now I changed my mind. The key is to grab the a and the b pawns, with my K, while my central pawns are defended.} Kf5 46. Kc4 Bb6 47. Kb5 Bd8 48. Kc6 {...and now the idea is to advance the e pawn. } Ke6 49. Be3 {...forbidding him the acces to the a7/g1 diagonal.} Be7 50. Ba7 {Giving away the f4 pawn, but...} Kf5 51. Kd7 Bf8 {Ready for the kill, but for a little detail.} 52. Bb8 Kxf4 53. e6+ Kxg5 54. e7 Bxe7 55. Kxe7 Kh4 {...and now it's done. The rest is not interesting. Thank you for reading and for your comments. Did I manage ok the game?} 56. Kd6 g5 57. Kc5 g4 58. Kb5 g3 59. Bxg3+ Kxg3 60. Kxa5 Kf4 61. Kxb4 {}
