1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {I know, I know. My choice. I know this system won't hold against good players, but I have worked a lot on it. } 3. Nc3 Qe5+ {Yes, because the queen must aim to c7, the right place. } 4. Qe2 {But ok, this is the other good white move I often face. Nc6 is not an option, since after QxQ, QxQ, Nd5 creates problems. The queen can go to a5, but I read and article called "The Qa5 phallcy", and I play it only on a determined line, as a way to c7 anyway.} Qxe2+ {Said that, the only other option (Qc5 is an ugly place to go) is this, I normally play. } 5. Bxe2 c6 {Ok, now black is underdeveloped, and it is sadly necessary to play this to control the white knight. But black has no weaknesses, no inmediate threat on him, and should manage.} 6. Bf3 {weird. } Bf5 {Developement with tempo taken, thank you!} 7. d3 {...and, more important, white lost the chance to play d4!, with a good space control on the centre. Now, I normally go on with e5. White attacks it, but my developement movements help defending it, and f6 is possible.  But this time I wanted to try a new idea. } Nf6 {He cannot do d4, right? So I prefer developing a piece than creating an outpost (e5) to be attacked by white.} 8. Nge2 {It worked. Of course, he is near castling and Re1, now. } e5 {Throwing away all my nice thoughts. A wise e6 would have been better. Let's say that I wanted to go in troubles by purpose, intending that if white played 9. d4, I would have repied with e4. White must then go 10. g4, Bg6 (mocking at him :-), and white must lose the bishop for a pawn the most.  It does sound nice, doesn't it?} 9. Ng3 Bg6 {Stable again. He can save his bishop, but he cannot play d4 because he plainly loses it. } 10. O-O {Ok, normal. I am two moves away from castling, so let's play for it. } Nbd7 {Queenside castling? Why not? Because or the lsb? Nooooo... impossible. :-)} 11. Re1 Bd6 {Two developement moves that defend e4. Will it be enough? In two moves, a rook will be on e8.} 12. Nce4 {This helps me, because I can exchange and eventually play f6, giving a strong support to e5.} Nxe4 13. Nxe4 {Even BxN would have worked, but I didn't want to risk against a bishop pair. } Bc7 14. d4 {Oh, yes, he caught me. Oh, well...} f6 15. dxe5 Nxe5 {Holding like a hero. I know I could play this because the Bf3 blocks the f pawn.  The other option, fxe5, leaves a bad hole on g5 white can exploit.  It comes that the best move is Bxe5, I realize now. } 16. Nc5 {Oh yes, I know. } O-O-O {and I got castling. Good. His c2 is under fire, and the Bc3 too. } 17. Be4 {Ok, the good one. I realized that I had to prevent Ne6 from white. But I didn't see the trick: Ba5!. Now, white has to defend the rook, but he can't because of the mate threat on d1. So, 18. c3 is needed. Then, BxB, 19. NxB, Nd3!, and the last white's bishop is gone, while we keep the dsb, a valuable piece in this position. But no, I didn't. I went...} Rhe8 18. Bxg6 {My initial though was hxg6, opening the h column. But I though this to be a too much "naive" plan, and I decided to play conservatively. } Nxg6 {Of course it is impossible Ne6 (RxN). White has to exchange rooks or play the bishop. They did both. } 19. Rxe8 Rxe8 20. Be3 {Well, this is an interesting game. Who has the advantage? White because of his pieces? Well, let's exchange them. } Bb6 21. b4 {I like this guy. He finds the right one. } Ne5 {My turn to spread my wings. } 22. a4 {Let's see, this is just a matter of technique. This comes to nothing, I just have to remember the right way to do it. :-)} a6 {If b5, a5, bxc6, Nxc6, and white has separated pawns... ok, it's not such a big deal, since I am the one under attack.} 23. a5 {...and to this, that blocks somewhat the attack, } Bc7 {This one. Now, the threat BxB, fxB and Rxe3 is not "on", because the knight is in beetween, and it is not my interest to have a hanging bishop there anymore. A plan was growing slowly in my mind, if only he doesn't see it coming. } 24. Rd1 {He didn't!} Ng4 {Nice, uh? A pawn seems won, the least, and much more if white is careles. } 25. Rd7 {And it was his original plan I didn't see! This guy is really nice, he always finds the right one. This means that I won't win a pawn, I will exchange it. } Nxe3 26. fxe3 Rxe3 27. Rxg7 {It's not over. My other pawns are about to die. } Re1+ 28. Kf2 Rc1 {I will recover the tempo with the check. } 29. Ne6 {Uh - oh! I didn't see it!} Rxc2+ {This can't harm. } 30. Ke3 Bxh2 {It would be more exchanges, or drawn, mister...} 31. Rg8+ {Ah, this one... it's ok. } Kd7 {A tempo.} 32. Nc5+ {And NOW, I made the worst of choices. I "saw" Bg1+, but I had to move the king. To c7. And he can take b7, etc... let's be "brilliant". } Rxc5 33. bxc5 Bg1+ 34. Ke4 Bxc5 {I estimate that I will take a5 too, even if losing h and f pawns. It would be a race. } 35. Rg7+ Kc8 {b7 is vital, it should be kept at al costs. } 36. Rxh7 Bb4 37. Rh5 {Defending the pawn, eh? The right one, to be true, must have been Bc3. But again, I wanted to be... well, forget it. Please :-)} c5 38. Rf5 Kd7 {You must take first, mister, so I can take too.} 39. Rxf6 Bxa5 40. Kd5 {Aha. Now, what? } Bb4 {This opens the way for the a pawn. } 41. g4 {Unifortunately, an enemy's pawn disagree...} a5 {And I went for the race. Losing. } 42. g5 a4 {?? Bc3 was the only one. } 43. g6 a3 44. g7 a2 45. Rf1 {Bleah. I fell in the trap like a bird. Well, played, white. As for me, someway I should have lost the game's perpective and I misundertood the position. Not about the last blunder, but for the RxN sac, and before.  }
