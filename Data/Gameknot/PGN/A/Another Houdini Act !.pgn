1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  Here is another match with Mike.  This time I become more active in the middlegame but Mike rebuffs my mating attack before it really gets started.  I drop material but does it result in a loss or will it be yet another Houdini Act from Yours Truly?  You can either find out from the GA below or you can simply read on.} Nf6 {1. ….. Nf6 - Mike responds to my Reti Opening by also bringing out his king knight.} 2. c4 d6 3. d4 Nbd7 4. Nc3 {4. Nc3 - out comes the other knight.  White's pawn centre looks good but can it be maintained?} e5 5. e4 {5. e4 - and now I add to it.} Be7 6. Be2 O-O 7. O-O c6 8. Be3 {8. Be3 - well, black looks more cramped than white - will I just this once avoid passivitis against Mike?} a6 9. d5 cxd5 10. cxd5 {10. cxd5 - pawn trade.} Ne8 11. Qd2 g6 12. Bh6 Ng7 13. Qe3 b5 14. a3 f5 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 {15. …… Kxg7 - knight trade.} 16. exf5 gxf5 {16. …… gxf5 - another pawn trade.} 17. Bd1 {17. Bd1 - King Mike is really exposed here, but can I take full advantage of this?} Rf6 18. Ng5 Nf8 19. Qg3 {19. Qg3? - and according to GA this is where I over-reach myself, it looks as though I have a nasty double check planned but Mike foils this with …...} Rg6 {17. ….. Rg6! - like this, my knight is now pinned against Glenda.} 20. h4 Bxg5 21. hxg5 Qxg5 22. Qxg5 Rxg5 {22. …… Rxg5 - after a plethora of exchanges including the queens I am now a pawn down.  Sigh!} 23. Bc2 Ra7 24. Rad1 Kh8 25. g3 Rag7 {25. …… Rag7 - a nasty rook pile on the g column will yield Mike a second pawn, double sigh!} 26. Ne2 f4 27. Rfe1 Bg4 {27. ……. Bg4 - pin and a threat of removal of the guard on the g3 pawn.  I can do zilch about this and if Henry moves to g2 then I will be hit with g3+ losing the knight on e2.} 28. Rd2 {28. Rd2 - pin breaker but here comes another stinger.} Bxe2 29. Rexe2 fxg3 30. fxg3 Rg5xg3+ 31. Reg2 Rg3xg2+ 32. Rxg2 Rxg2+ 33. Kxg2 {33. Kxg2 - after another plethora of exchanges after Mike pins my knight to my rook I have a BvN endgame two pawns down.  Does Henry have a prayer?  Well, so long as I keep my mitts off the resign button he does because there may be some divine intervention on the way.} a5 34. b4 axb4 35. axb4 {25. axb4 - pawn trade.  I may now have the chance of picking off the isolani on b5 and winning back one of my pawns.} Ng6 36. Kf3 {36. Kf3 - Henry gets to the action as quickly as he can.} Kg7 37. Bd3 Ne7 38. Ke4 h5 39. Bxb5 {39. Bxb5 - one pawn regained.} Nc8 40. Bd7 {40. Bd7 - to cut the h pawn off.} Nb6 41. Be6 Kf6 42. b5 {42. b5 - passers must be pushed!} Kg5 43. Kf3 {43. Kf3 - incredibly it looks as though there is a Joblock operating here, on a chessboard with hardly any pieces on it.  It is King Mike who is being blocked from helping his pawn through to g8!  Fou Leblanc and my isolated d5 pawn protect each other.} h4 44. Ke4 {44. Ke4 and draw offer.  On the previous turn Mike told me he thought this game was heading for a draw.  Mike's knight is tied down to preventing my b pawn from reaching Glendadom, Fou Leblanc cuts off the h pawn and Henry still cuts off King Mike from assisting it down to h8 so that was why Mike and I considered the game drawn at this point.  So, divine intervention from Fou Leblanc and another Operation Joblock means that Houdini Jo escapes again!  More triple wheew!}
