1. d4 {This was a game in an annotation tournament, and it turned into something of a marathon! Although it is "only a draw" is not without interest!} d5 2. c4 {and continue with the Queen's Gambit} c6 {Which he declines withe the Slav variation} 3. Nf3 {This is best, Nc3 allows an interesting gambit 3.....e5?!} Nf6 4. Nc3 {Now I get the other knight out} dxc4 5. a4 {I play this to prevent him hanging on to the pawn with b7-b5} Bf5 6. e3 {Played to open up a diagonal for my Bf1. I am now threatening to recapture the pawn and there is no good way for him to hold onto it} e6 7. Bxc4 {So I get my pawn back} Nbd7 8. O-O {I castle. With the a2 pawn on a4, there just isn't enough pawn cover on the queen side. As my king has to go to g1, I may as well put it there now.} Bb4 9. Nh4 {Hitting the bishop. We are still in the opening database.} Bg4 10. f3 {played with the idea of playing e3-e4 at some stage.} Bh5 11. e4 {Like now! Post-match gameknot computer analysis says we are out of the books and black is 0.15 ahead. I am not convinced, looks pretty level to me. It was played in Portisch, Lajos (2650) vs. Smyslov, Vassily (2545) in 1981 and Black won in 41, http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x69837&mv=21&rnd=0.6795143269890982 but I think one can improve on White's play, for instance instead of 13. g3 perhaps White can try g4. A couple of Gameknot games continued with 11. e4 O-O 12. g4 Ne8 13. Ng2 Bg6 14. Qb3 a5, both draws.} h6 12. g4 {Hitting the bishop again, as hinted at in the previous note} g5 13. Ng2 {He is relunctant to give up the two bishops, but this weakens his king side.} Bg6 14. Qb3 {I hit the other bishop, as in the Gameknot games just referred to} Qb6 15. Kh1 {His Qb6 attacked along the b6-g1 diagonal. As my king lies at the end of that diagonal, I decided to move it out of the way, and unpin my d pawn.} O-O-O 16. a5 {With kings castled on opposite sides, and queens still on the board, I have to attack his king before he attacks mine} Bxa5 17. Qa3 {I am threatening Qxa5 now} Bb4 {So he moves the bishop} 18. Qxa7 {I take the pawn back} Qxa7 19. Rxa7 {and I recpature, with level material restored} Kb8 20. Ra2 {This seemed best, in case I wanted to play Rf1-a1} e5 21. Be3 {I finally develop my Bc1 and perhaps prepare Rf1-a1} Nb6 22. dxe5 {I have opened up an attack on his Nb6} Nxc4 23. exf6 {So I take the piece back. He has two bishops now, but his Bg6 seems permanently out of the game} Nxe3 24. Nxe3 {and now he has two bishop against my two knights. Normally this would favour the bishops in an open position, but as I said, his Bg6 is dead wood for the time being. Although at the time I was confident of my position, post-match Gameknot computer analysis gives this as +0.41 to Black.} Rd3 25. Nc4 {But where else to move the knight? f5 allows him to exchange his dreadful bishop} Re8 26. Rd1 {I need to try and exchange off his active rook.} Rxd1+ 27. Nxd1 {So I take back} b5 28. Nce3 {My knight is forced back} Rd8 29. Ra1 {Although White is a pawn up, it is clear he is defending. Computer gives this 1.29 to Black} Rd3 30. Kg2 {I need to centralise and activate that king!} Bc5 {He hits my knight again} 31. Kf2 {I defend} Rd2+ 32. Ke1 {Offering him a pawn back, but virtually the only move, for instance 32. Kg3? Bd6! and wins or 32. Kg1? Re2! and wins} Bb4 33. Kf1 {He was threatening nasty discovered checks with his rook.} Rxh2 34. Rc1 {Attacking c6 and maybe I can neutralise his Rh2 with Rc2. Computer gives Black 1.27 ahead.} Kb7 35. Nf2 {Maybe I can trap his rook in the corner. The problem is he can get mine too.} Bd2 36. Rc3 {Better to lose rook for bishop than knight for nothing.} Bxc3 37. bxc3 {I have to recapture} Kb6 38. Kg1 {So now I go after his rook} Rxf2 39. Kxf2 {I take back. Computer says +0.92 to Black. I would have a fine position, except now he can free his bishop with a timely h6-h5 and I can no longer meet it with h2-h3. He is also threatening K-c5-d6-e6, takes on f6, moves the king, plays f7-f6 and his bishop is free again. I can't keep it locked in, best to let it out and avoid material lose.} Kc5 40. e5 {So I block his king march} b4 {so he plays this queen side thrust} 41. cxb4+ {I take, expecting him to recapture and push his c pawn} Kd4 {But he plays this instead, and now I have to try to prevent him taking on e5 and then f6} 42. Ke2 {So my king comes across} Kxe5 {He takes} 43. Nc4+ {I check} Kd5 {King comes } 44. Na5 {Knight hits the c pawn} Bc2 {Bishop mobilises} 45. Ke3 {King centralises} Ba4 46. Nb7 {Heading for c5} Ke5 47. Nc5 {Completing the manoeuvre and hitting his bishop} Bb5 48. Ne4 {Finally finding a way to protect f6. Computer says +0.78 to Black} Bf1 49. Nd2 {Hitting his bishop} Ba6 50. Nb3 {The knight and the bishop continue their merry dance} Bc4 51. Na5 {He attacks me, I attack him. My knight finds itself back on a5} Bd5 52. Nb7 {Maybe heading for c5 or d6} Kxf6 {he finally takes} 53. f4 {I advance} Ke7 54. f5 {I block the position a little. Knights like blocked positions, bishops like open positions.} f6 55. Na5 {Kinght dances again} Kd7 56. Nb7 {and back...} Bf7 57. Nc5+ {I check him} Ke7 58. Ne4 {and I hit his weak spot on f6} h5 59. gxh5 {I may as well take, he has successfully rid himself of the backward h pawn} Bxh5 60. Nf2 {Keeping an eye on the g pawn} Bf7 61. Ne4 {re-centralising the knight} Bb3 62. Kd3 {Centralising the king} Bd5 63. Ng3 {The pawn ending is lost, if I allow him to exchange on e4, whereas it seems hard for him to win this.} Kd6 64. Kd4 {I have to stop his king entering my position. Computer says +1.72 to Black} Bg2 65. Nh5 {I'm in the mood for dancing.... hitting f6. The knight almost seems determined to make as many moves as possible.} Bh3 66. Ng3 {He counter-attacks, I protect} Kd7 67. Kc5 {My king seems to be better than his now} Bg2 68. Nh5 {Hitting the f6 pawn again} Ke7 69. Ng3 {Protecting f5 and stopping his g pawn advancing too much} Bf3 70. Nf1 {More dancing} Be4 71. Ng3 {repeating and hitting his bishop} Bg2 72. Ne2 {Hoping for a draw by repetition} Bf3 73. Ng3 {keeping up the osculations} Kf8 74. Kd6 {My king gets deeper into the position. Computer gives Black only 0.62 up now} Kf7 75. Kc5 {This may be a mistake, although computer doesn't think so!} g4 76. Nh5 {Computer thinks both g4 and 76. Nh5 are mistakes. Computer prefers 76. Kd6 Kg7 77. Ke7 Bd1 78. Ke6 Bb3+ 79. Kd7 Ba4 80. Ke7 Bc2 81. Kd7 Kh6 82. Kxc6 Kg5 83. b5 Kh4 84. Ne2 Bxf5 85. b6 Be4+ 86. Kd6 and Black is only +0.84 and thinks that Black is up 1.45 in the game. I am not convinced.   } Ke7 77. Ng3 {I am still protecting f5 and the g pawn seems blocked} Kd7 78. Nh5 {back and forth...} Kc7 79. Ng3 {returning again} Bd1 80. Kd4 {King centralises} Kb6 81. Ke4 {and again} Kb5 82. Nh5 {My b pawn will drop, but I will get the f pawn in return} Bc2+ 83. Kf4 {and now my king is in a position to take the g pawn} Kxb4 84. Kxg4 {A curious exchange of pawns} Bd1+ {He finally forces off the minor pieces} 85. Kh4 {I have to keep on the knight of course} Bxh5 86. Kxh5 {I take back} c5 87. Kg6 {I have to take this pawn and puch my pawn} c4 88. Kxf6 {I take} c3 89. Kg7 {I move out of the way of my pawn which has to advance. He agrees a draw, it is a book draw. He will queen, but I will get my pawn to the 7th. See http://www.chess.com/article/view/queen-vs-pawn-on-7th Also run the position past a few endgame database, which will prove that it is drawn. As to why I didn't win it, and where I went wrong, I honestly don't know!
