1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 f5 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nbd2 h6 5. h4 {Opening a square for the black N on g4. } Bd6 6. Ne5 Nd7 7. e3 {Nd2-f3 was the "normal" one. } Bxe5 8. Qh5+ {...bt who can resist this?} Kf8 9. dxe5 Qe8 {Well, nothing is perfect. So let's try to keep on developement...} 10. Be2 {...with this move. But it has a flaw: } g6 {...of course. } 11. Qf3 h5 {!? Black's weak point: e6. Difficult to threat. } 12. c4 {No threat on b4... yet. } c6 13. cxd5 cxd5 {Bb5 is useless, because it is easily kicked with a6, etc. On b3, my lsb is almost useless.} 14. Nb3 {Nd4 threatens e6. Not so easy, but still there. } Qe7 {Now Qb4+ is annoying, and note that o-o is not good after Qxh4. } 15. a3 {Obvious, but this is not the "finesse". } a6 {Planning Bb7, but I won't let time for it. } 16. Rc1 {c7 is a very good square for my R, specially if supported.} Nb6 {Nice, since it prevents Rc7, but leaves e5 unattacked, so my dsb is free to move. } 17. Nd4 {Not the best. Qg3 attacks g6.} Bd7 {Now, Rc7 is useless because of Rc8. } 18. Bg5 Qf7 19. O-O {I can castle now, because now Rc7 is possible. Rf1 will support the other one. } Nh6 {Ng4 is harmless, so...} 20. Rc7 Ng4 {I simply didn't see Rxb7... very strong!} 21. Qg3 {Since black didn't play Rc8, I have no reason to put mine on c1, while the black K's position can be exploited if I manage to get the f column open. } Rb8 {I can say it was on purpose. Black defends b7, but leaves me a tempo to play...} 22. Rfc1 {? f3 was the move. Nh6, e4...} Kg8 {Wisely. } 23. f3 Nh6 24. Bf6 Rh7 {The BQ is dued to the defence of g6. If black moves Nb6, RxB can be considered. } 25. Qg5 {Not sure. I just wanted to press the position. } Kf8 {Here I overlooked Nxe6, QxN, Qxg6. Not sure about it, though...} 26. e4 {Shall we open the position a little? There is a piece congestion over there...} dxe4 {Black should have held, and played Ng8, exchanging the B (I was considering Bd8 as a defence).} 27. fxe4 fxe4 28. Rf1 {This demonstrate that Rf-c1 was a loss of time. } Nf5 {g4 is not advisable, due to Nxh4 to follow, or Rxh4, planning Qh7 and nasty threats on my K. No way.} 29. Nxe6+ {I played the sac now, not sure it was properly timed, but anyway...} Qxe6 30. Qxg6 {Black has Qf7, true. But then, QxNf5, BxQ, RxQ+, RxR, RxN.} Rf7 31. Bxh5 {Now I already thought about RxN.} Nd5 {RxB, QxR, RxN is possible, but...} 32. Rxf5 Rxf6 {Trying to mix up things! Nice try, but here comes the obvious "finesse". Can you see the mate in... few?} 33. Qh6+ Kg8 34. Rg5+ Rg6 {If Kf7, Qg7#.} 35. Rxg6+ Qxg6 {Which is the right take?} 36. Qxg6+ {?? I thinh that after Bxg6, mate was unavoidable. } Kh8 37. Rxd7 {... but this was winning all the same!} Ne7 38. Rxe7 {That's all folks... :-) I hope you spent a while similing...}
