1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. h3 h6 5. g4 e6 6. c3 Bd6 7. Ne5 Bxe5 8. dxe5 Ne4 9. h4 {All normal so far. } Ne7 {Ok, interesting try from black. } 10. f3 {I should avoid to block the white diagonal, but I didn't think there will be much action in it without my central knight. } Nc5 11. Qd4 {A move to free my queen. } b6 12. b4 {Bad move. Here I had to open the way for my bishop or knignt. To develop. } Nb7 {this is like a spring: now black can free his position with c5. } 13. e3 {I had to develop my lsb aiming to the queenside. } Ng6 14. Bg3 {No problem, man...} Qe7 {Further supporting c5? } 15. Nd2 {No point in checking him. I develop. } c5 16. bxc5 Qxc5 {I was waiting for the knight, but black hopes in an even endgame. } 17. Bd3 {The best thing I can do is let him exchange.} Qxd4 18. exd4 {Which he does. Now I have a weakness in c3, but a strong central pawn chain. Let's see if I can defend it. } Ne7 {A wasted tempo for the attack: Bd7 - Rc8. } 19. a4 {Not wise. Just to make more space for Ra3 and the other rook in c1. } O-O 20. Nb3 {Black is not in a hurry, so I even think about a break in a5. } f6 {Logical try by black. } 21. Kd2 {I moved the king the wrong square. It was an oversight. } fxe5 22. Bxe5 Rxf3 23. Ke2 {At least, he can't support the rook with the other. } Rf8 24. g5 {It's my turn to attack. His tangled pieces on the queenside give me an excellent opportunity I don't have to waste. } Nc6 25. Bg3 {I cannot allow my dsb to be exchanged, it's too strong a piece. } h5 26. Bg6 {Mistake by black, because of this move. On the other side, to let the pawn's exchange would have been lethal, too. } Nba5 {It is impossible to avoid the penetration of a knight in c4. } 27. Nxa5 Nxa5 28. Bxh5 {The way is now open. Will I be on time?} Nc4 {Not harmful. Apparently. } 29. Bg6 a5 {Black has his plan, involving his bishop in a6, supported by the rook, } 30. h5 Ba6 {Now, this is very nasty. I can't allow the knight to exchange my bishop or something weird. } 31. Ke1 {Sigh, a tempo lost for the other rook to join. } Ne3 {Dangerous? Well, yes: Rf1+, RxR, NxR and my attack vanishes. } 32. h6 {Let's pretend he won't see it. } Ng2+ 33. Kd2 Nf4 {Now, I want both my bishops, here, but I suffered from a mirage. } 34. hxg7 Nxg6 35. gxf8=Q+ Rxf8 {So I have a rook for a knight. } 36. Rh6 {But I have to press.} Nf4 37. Rah1 Kg7 38. Rh6h7+ Kg6 39. Rh1h6+ Kf5 {The game was far from won after Kxg5. But this position gave me a sadistic idea: } 40. Rf6+ Rxf6 {Black must take, or RxR. } 41. gxf6 {And black has to take the pawn (losing the knight), because I bet if it goes Ng3 white will be able to win a piece the least. What do you think?}
