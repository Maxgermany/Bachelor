[Opening "Scandinavian (B01), Icelandic gambit"]

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 {White can go e5, entering an interesting game for black that is very difficult to break if you don't know it very well. Not advisable for beginners (my opinion, of course). } Nf6 {The second "surprise" move leading to the Icelandic gambit. } 3. c4 {This "natural" answer by white, opens some holes in white's position black can exploit, based on Bb4 followed by Ne4, under some circumstances. } e6 {The Icelandic gambit itself. This gambit loses a pawn for developement, opening lines to the white king, as strange as it may seem. } 4. dxe6 {White bites it. It's not bad, provided you know what to to next. } Bxe6 {Nothing dangerous. Now, can white play d4 safely? No. Bb4+, and how ever white defends, black starts an attack based on Qe7, Ne4, and Bxc4+ (disc.) moves (in different order, depending on white's moves), and white will lose the initiative, if not more. Good responsed by white are many, starting with d3 (the problem of the lsb developement is handled with Be2, it's not aggressive but it is not bad. In some scenarios, even g3 - Bg2 is thinkable. } 5. b3 {This was a surprise, but it is not bad. Unfortunately, looking into theory shows that is also one of the well-analyzed lines. My oppenent didn't know it., and I can't blame him. } Qe7 {This fourth odd-looking moves opens a treat of a discovered check that allows black to grab c4. Even at the cost of a queen's exchange. It isolates the d pawn, and white's game will be very hard to play. Please note the subtlety of black's threat on c4: white doesn't have to defend it, it has to shield the check. He can do it with the knight or the bishop. In both cases, black can reinforce the pressure with Bg4, or Nc6-d4. White has to play carefully, here. Once the check is shielded, c4 is not more in danger. This is the essential point. } 6. f4 {White goes for this "novelty", that happens to be just a bad move, because of the previous note. } Bxc4+ 7. Kf2 {White can shield with a minor piece, that's right, but at the cost of Bxe2, neutralizing the threat on the bishop and finally consolidate the pawn's advantage. White thinks that by gettin the king out of danger, he will escape such a fate. And it was not a bad idea, but it fails. } Ne4+ {One of the first reasons f4 was bad was because it left my knight the possibility to do this! White couldn't easily spot the importance of this some moves ago. Still, you have to know.} 8. Kf3 {Here, my opponent blundered with 8. Ke3, allowing Nc3+(disc.), and I win the queen (but I can mate or very near even if I don't take it quickly). } Bd5 {This has white in a hell of a trouble. The first threat is the WQeen, that can be taken by the knight once it leaves, checking the king. And the king can't be easily moved (Kg4, h5+, and back). So the queen must be moved away from the knight's two-moves action. Note that no piece can threat the black bishop, except Bc4. Plese explore the following lines, after 9. Bc4, Nxd2++!, 10. Kf2... and remember that once the d2 pawn is out, black threats to have a Q or a B on the great diagonal (a1-h8) and win the Ra1, trapped by the knight. } 9. Qc2 {A safe square for the queen, holding c3. A good move, IMO.} Nxd2+ {The double check was unavoidable. The king has to move. } 10. Kf2 {Please explore the was in which black wins after Kg3, starting with Qe1+...} Qc5+ {It is not wise to exchange queens in the attack, but just to show black's powerful position, and exploiting the "residual" threat on the white Ra1, I allowed myself to exchange. This is was because I didn't see a more aggressive move in the position. I may be wrong. Maybe Ne4+ was not so a dull try as it seemed.  The exchange has also the advantage to bring out my undeveloped dsb, which will form a powerful pair against white.  I have changed from a doubious heckmate threat to a very sure "ruinous loss of material". My opponent will be temporarily relieved from the queen's exchange, but he is already doomed. } 11. Qxc5 Bxc5+ 12. Ke1 {What else? But now... can you see? c3 has no defence, and the rook is trapped by the knight, and a bishop can go to d4. This means white will lose a piece, as a minimum. But I have the knight's problem to solve. How?} Nxf1 {White has to retake. A good try is 13. Bb2, but by retreating to Ne3, black saves a piece for the g7 pawn (after Bb2xg7). Black is a piece up, then. And don't forget that black can also play Nxh2, because if RxN, BxN and black is still up a piece!} 13. Kxf1 Bd4 {This is how it works. White can't save the rook other than interposing the knight, and losing it. There are no other moves I can see to get him out of this. } 14. Nc3 {White interposes the knight, in the believe that he will create space for the rook on b1, but...} Bxc3 15. Rb1 Be4 {...this is the strenght of a well placed bishop's pair. White can safely resign, here. A good show about how NOT to play against the Icelandic Gambit. }
