1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 {A strategic mistake. Black loses a tempo and allows the White Queen to come to the center very early making the K-side development a little tricky.} 5. Qxd4 e6 6. Nc3 {I was thinking of playing 6.c4 but for blitz games it's better to play actively.} Nf6 {An interesting plan would have been 6...Ne7 followed by 7...Nc6 driving the Queen from her lovely outpost.} 7. Bg5 {Putting immediate pressure on the Nf6 and preparing to castle long. Due to Black's 4th I have a very easy plan of development and the initiative.} Be7 8. O-O-O O-O {Now that both sides have castled it's time to start the attack.} 9. h4 {Tempting Black to play ...} h6 {Since the h4 square is no longer available to the Bishop, Black thought he could either force White to exchange on f6 or break the annoying pin. It's still very hard to suggest something good for Black. 9...d6 weakens the d-pawn and apart from the looming threat of Bxf6, White could play 10.e5 immediately. Trying to develop with 9...b6 still leaves the d-pawn weak and again 10.e5 is possible.} 10. e5 {Maybe not 100% correct but it certainly makes it difficult for Black to keep the balance. If the King was on b1, Black wouldn't have the Bg5+ resource to complicate matters. Still White gets a strong attack in case Black takes the piece. For example 10...hxg5 11.hxg5 Nd5 12.Nxd5 exd5 13.f4 leaves Black paralyzed. In case 11...Nh7 12.f4 opens the f2-h4 route for the Queen to come to the h-file. In both lines, Black is forced to counter sacrifice on g5 if he wants to stay alive, but then White still keeps the advantage.} Nd5 {Refusing the piece sacrifice, Black wants to exchange Bishops and/or Knights to reduce some of the pressure.} 11. Nxd5 {11.Bxe7 allows Nxe7 and Black is still alive. } Bxg5+ {This loses by force. The safest reply was 11...exd5 but after 12.Bxe7 Qxe7 13.Qxd5, White is a solid pawn up and has a lot of pressure on the d-file.} 12. hxg5 Qxg5+ {Trying to keep the h-file closed at all costs.} 13. f4 {Blocking the check with tempo and winning a piece.} Qd8 {More safe would have been 13...Qg4 or Qg3. This loses outright to White's next move.} 14. Nf6+ {Giving the piece back to obtain a huge attack. White almost has a forced mate here.} gxf6 15. exf6 {Black is hopelessly lost here.} d5 16. Rxh6 {16.Qc3 was even stronger but this move still wraps things up nicely for White.} e5 {Trying to bring the Bishop into the defense of the King.} 17. fxe5 {17.Qxe5 was stronger but White is still mating after this.} Bf5 18. Bd3 {Now 18.Qh4 would have quickly mated but I wanted to attack with all my pieces.} Bxd3 19. Rxd3 Qd7 20. Rg3+ {With mate on the next move. Clearly White's best piece was his Queen which hasn't moved from White's 5th but nonetheless instilled terror into the Black monarch from the d4 square.}
