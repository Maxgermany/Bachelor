1. e4 d5 2. e5 {Less often played than exd, leads to a well-known game in which one of main black concerns is how to develop the dsb. } Bf5 3. d4 e6 4. c3 {I would try c4 instead, but this move makes black play following a known scheme. } a6 {I'm not in a hurry, and I just don't like the game after Bb5+.} 5. Nf3 h6 {Clamly, making room for my lsb to h2. This move is not recommended in my own personal line, since it takes the h6 square, often the knight's way out. } 6. a3 {This is a loss of tempo, since b4 is already guarded. And it weakens b3.} c5 7. Be3 {True is that the dsb's way would be closed for a long time. And with it, with two more pieces, the knight and the rook. } Qb6 8. Qc1 {It's true my kingside is blocked, but I have plenty of play on the queenside. } Nc6 9. h3 {Pointless, the bishop's diagonal is mine. } cxd4 {Trying to free my dsb, even though for an exchange. } 10. cxd4 {He holds me in, but in doing so, he is trapping his own pieces, now completely inactive. } Na5 11. Nbd2 {Guarding b3, naturally. } Kd8 {Can you believe this? Black's best move, and it is losing castling right, making his way toward the center... etc. etc. } 12. g4 {I can play Rf8 right now, but I started to "spin" (toward disaster). } Be4 {NxB, Nb3!, Qb1, NxR} 13. Bg2 {White tries to castle, but overlooks....} Rc8 14. Qd1 {Nothing clear comes out from Bc2, Qe2, so...} Bd3 {Preventing castling, but the bishop is undefended. } 15. b4 {Inmediately I thought about Bxb4. A piece for two pawns, AND the freedom of the kingside, finally. But what can whte do, really?} Nc4 16. Nb3 {NxN, BxN, and black doesn't have problems. But this is mortal for white. } Nb2 17. Qd2 Rc2 {Wow! I never thought I could reach this queenbind in a real game...} 18. Qxc2 Bxc2 19. O-O {White probably calculates that after BxN, Rb1 will recover the piece. He was in an urgo to castle.} Bxb3 20. Rab1 Bc4 {...but he didn't see this one. Here, the exchange lines fail. } 21. Rfc1 Na4 {Or Nd3. But I didn't see much future there. Here blocks completely any white's plan...} 22. Nd2 Bd3 23. Rb3 {To keep the good diagonal is important. Here, white can exchange the bishop with Bf1, but in that case it's ok.} Qb5 24. f4 {As you can see, despite being +7 material advantage, black has a long job to do prior to prevale. Note that at move 24 my kingside is still unmoved!} Ne7 25. h4 Nc8 26. h5 Ncb6 27. f5 {White can even have some attack!} Nc4 {Exchanging some more piece would have given my the victory, for sure. }
