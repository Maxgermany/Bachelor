1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {This is named Russian Defence or Petrov's Defence.Played by grandmasters like Kramnik and Mamedyarov. Attacking the white's pawn rather than defending his own pawn is the main charachter of this opening.} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Be2 {We changed pawns normally,d6 was a common move and i wanted to play less dangerously and placed the bishop to e2.} Be7 {The bishop whose diagonal goes till a3 closed is a candidate to make good defensive work at e7.} 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 d5 {Both sides play symetrical.} 8. Re1 Nc6 9. c4 Bb4 {An ambitous effort by using the free diagonal and attacks the rook.} 10. Nbd2 {Makes him cannot capture the rook.  } Kh8 {After the game i asked him why he had done this move i couldn't understand it.Here are  braveart's opinions:  it was an untimely move and playing it at the point that I did contributed to the loss , but the idea was sound . My queen was definding d5 . In the event that your c4 pawn takes (and it did) my dpawn the queen would be brought the same diagonal as my king , with that diagonal open to my king , your light squared bishop could ( if the bishop were defended then win my queen .... but the move was definitely premature and wasted time in this particular game} 11. a3 Be7 {Try to make the knight unpinned.} 12. b4 b6 13. cxd5 Qxd5 14. Bc4 Qh5 15. Nxe4 {He loses his knight after several moves.} Bb7 16. d5 {I tried to close the bishops diagonal by attacking the knight. } Rad8 {He cleverly pins my pawn and makes his knight uncapturable.} 17. Ng3 Qg6 18. Qb3 {Here he has resigned.Cause both threatens knight and bishop and he will lose one of them and i have chance to found dangerous attack.I thank him so much,he is probably better than me what his rating and my brain says,however there is no unbeaten person.}
