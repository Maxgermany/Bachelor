[Opening "Sicilian (B72), dragon, classical attack"]

1. e4 {I've been holding off on this one, but might as well give it a go. Black's attack never really gets off the ground (as he goes in for a dubious variation on the 20th move) and the position flirts with disaster for a long time and eventually he solves his immediate problems at the cost of simplifying into an excruciating endgame. White's handling of the position leaves a very strong impression.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. Qd2 Nc6 8. f3 O-O 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Rb8 {Again, the 'Chinese' Dragon. } 11. Bb3 {The main move, and the most flexible choice. White anticipates ...b5, when the bishop will want to retreat anyway. Of course b3 is a great defensive square for the bishop, but it is double-edged as the coming pawn storm on the queenside often targets this piece's lack of outpost squares. There are many alternatives. Alternative variation: [ An interesting sideline is] 11. h4 [ (obviously not 11.g4? as examined previously)] b5 12. Bb3 a5 [ When White has to suck it up and play] 13. Ndxb5 [ (or else the b3 bishop is in serious trouble)] a4 14. Bxa4 [ with 2 pawns and a very sharp position, e.g.] Qa5 15. h5 Ne5 16. hxg6 Bxb5 17. Bxb5 Rxb5 18. Nxb5 Qxa2 19. Nc3 Qa1  20. Nb1 Nc4 21. gxf7  Kh8 22. Qb4 Nd5 [ when White's head has exploded! Of course not all of that is forced, and even in this position it is rather unclear, but certainly White has to solve a lot of problems just to dispel Black's initiative and that is rarely fun for the first player. Unexplored and excessively complicated positions like these are one of the perks of the 'Chinese Dragon.' These sidelines have not been reduced to endgames and forced draws as in more mainstream systems.] } Na5 {An improved version of the more typical ...Ne5 plan. Black can still play ... b5 and ..Nc4, but now he has other options that White must consider. For instance, ...Nxb3 might be useful at some point, and even ...e5 has some merit (after trading off the Dragon bishop). Alternative variation: [ Black can also continue more actively with] 11... b5 [but lately] 12. Nxc6 Bxc6 13. Bxa7 [has garnered much attention. It's hard to believe in this for White, but it's basically a favorable variation of the 11. Nxc6?! idea. Concrete analysis seems to show that White can hold the pawn and not suffer too badly for it, and it's not so obvious how Black will generate activity when his pieces have no means to quickly contest the b3 bishop.] Ra8 14. Bd4 b4 15. Nd5 Bxd5 16. exd5 Qa5 [and Black's "normal" counterplay looks insufficient. Clearly Black needs some new ideas in earlier moves if he wants to enter this variation.] } 12. Bh6 {Surely the most active move for White, but not the main move. Alternative variation: [Often seen is ] 12. Kb1 [which is common prophylaxis against Black's queenside ambitions in the Dragon (the king is basically safer on the light square b1, but it's complicated). A lot of White players are starting to omit this move in this specific line, as in the game, but it's not so clear if they are right.] Alternative variation: [ Also typical is] 12. h4 b5 13. h5 Nc4 14. Bxc4 bxc4 [ with a sharp game in typical Dragon style.] } Bxh6 13. Qxh6 b5 {This is pretty much forced, but it feels empty. Black's ...Nc4 isn't so threatening without the Qd2/Be3 combo, and Black would be much better off if the typical .. .Rxc3 were a possibility. Indeed, Black has to make some strange concessions just to generate play and survive White's attack. } 14. h4 e5 {Absolutely necessary, but a little strange-looking. Closing off the Dragon diagonal isn't a concern any more, but the backwards d-pawn certainly is. The first point is that Black will play ...Nxb3 in the future (what else to do with the a5 knight?) and allowing the White knight to recapture on b3 isn't so great. The second is simply that the knight is simply not well placed on e2, and the third - ... e5 comes with tempo. Since it's hard for White to pressure the d-pawn with his heavy pieces aimed at the kingside, Black reasons that this weakness is less important than the 'here-and-now' considerations of generating active counterplay. Alternative variation: [Absolutely no fun is] 14... b4 15. Nd5 Nxb3  16. Nxb3 Nxd5 17. exd5 f6 [when White can play out his kingside attack and then switch to dominating the center with a strong bind.] 18. f4 Bg4 19. Rd3 ( 19. h5 gxh5 20. Rd3 Rf7 [is fine for Black]) 19... Bf5 20. Nd4 Qd7 ([Not] 20... Bxd3 21. Ne6) ([Also losing is] 20... Bd7 21. h5 g5 22. fxg5 fxg5 23. Qxg5 ) 21. Re3 Rbc8 22. Rhe1 } 15. Nde2 b4 16. Nd5 Nxb3+ 17. axb3 Nxd5 18. Rxd5 {...e5 forces this entire sequence of moves. From here, Black needs a new plan. The text initiates a sort of blockade along the dark squares, which has been seen in a previous game. } Rb6 19. h5 g5 20. f4 {The only way to generate immediate activity on the kingside. White plans Nxf4, when the knight is basically poison. } gxf4 {This is a pretty serious lapse in judgment. It was my first time 'over-the-board' against 20.f4!? and I underestimated the strength of White's attack and also the potency of 20... Bg4 (which really seems to refute White's idea). I still think Black can hold after the text, but the game becomes razor sharp in favor of the attacker and I wouldn't enter this line again. During the game I figured that I could force perpetual (or something deadlier) if things got too dicey. In those lines I didn't realize how deadly a rook lift to g3 is. I guess now I know..! Alternative variation: [ The best move is clearly] 20... Bg4 [exploiting the Ne2's loose position. Then the most vigorous response from White is to just sac the knight, but Black seems to hold, e.g.] 21. fxg5 Bxe2 22. g6 fxg6 23. hxg6 Qe7 24. gxh7  Kh8 [and after a series of 'only' moves Black is basically winning, but it's complicated.] } 21. Nxf4 f6 {Alternative variation: [Of course] 21... exf4 22. Rg5  [leads to mate] } 22. Ng6 {Of course the knight is immune on g6 too. } Rf7 {Obvious, but certainly effective. 7th rank defense is very convenient here for Black's rook, which can swing across to the queenside if need be. } 23. Nh4 Ra6 {Alternative variation: [ Another option, which may be objectively better, is] 23... Qf8 [ trying to fend off White's attack by threatening exchanges.] 24. Qe3 f5 [ Rather remarkable, but basically sound. Black has strong f-file pressure and might as well force the issue and gain a passed pawn in the process.] 25. Nxf5 Bxf5 26. exf5 Rxf5 [and the game will probably end in a draw, as White's back rank issues seem too great for him to assemble pressure against the backwards d-pawn.] 27. h6 Kh8 28. Rhd1 Rf6 29. Ra5 Qxh6 $11 } 24. Kb1 {This is forced, as ...Ra1  is annoying for White is not completely devastating.  } Be6 {This move is a little artificial. The bishop move doesn't gain time, as White wants to reorganize via Rd3 in any case. Black basically loses a tempo here, given the reality that c-file pressure (which ...Be6 supports via ... Bxb3 and freeing the 7th rank) isn't coming fast enough. This game appears to be a case of Black playing too strongly for winning chances in a position that should just draw. Alternative variation: 24... Rg7 25. Rhd1 ([Of course not] 25. Rd3 Qa5 [ and Black is winning, given the loose h1 piece.]) 25... Rg4 26. Qd2 (26. Nf3 Bc8 $1 [and Black looks very solid.] ([The natural] 26... Be6 $2 [ fails in high style to] 27. Nxe5 $1 [ when either recapture reveals something bad!])) 26... Rxh4 27. Rxd6 Rxd6 28. Qxd6 Rxh5 29. Qd5  [and Black has real winning chances after ...Rh1  and ... Rg1 (planning to march the h-pawn down the board). Objectively, however, the game should probably draw.] Kf8 30. Qxd7 Qxd7 31. Rxd7 } 25. Rd3 {A very strong square for the rook. White can use the g-file from g3 while remaining coordinated on all areas of the board! At the same time it isn't clear what Black should be doing to stem the tide, except for his next move. } Rg7 {Something has to be done about the looming Rg3 , and this seems most natural. Unfortunately, it also limits Black's ability to play things like ...Rc7 in the future. It is worth noting that even given Black's (small!) inaccuracies, this position is still razor sharp and probably equal. Alternative variation: [After] 25... Qf8 26. Qd2 [is very strong. White shows off his superior coordination by probing Black's weaknesses on other parts of the board.] } 26. Rf3 {The only real move. White pressures the stranded f-pawn, which can't really be defended. But should it be captured? } Bf7 {This move anticipates the rather tame 27.Qxf6. Here, Black misses a chance to try ...d5!? and open up the game. Given the preponderance of heavy pieces on the board, it's likely offers good drawing chances. After the text, White finds a very strong continuation. } 27. Rhh3 {A very dangerous idea. White intends to force the issue on g3 rather than play for simplification. Black can probably hold, but he is in great danger. This is all possible without the bishop on e6 or d7 to cover h3. Alternative variation: [Also good is]  27. Qxf6 Qxf6 28. Rxf6 Bxh5 29. Rg1 Rf7 ([Interesting is] 29... Bg4 [which atte mpts to hold the superior bishop and push for a win. Nonetheless, after] 30. Rgf1 h5 31. R1f2 [White looks dangerously coordinated and should be better.]) 30. Rxf7 Kxf7 31. g4 Bg6 32. Nxg6 Kxg6 [and the game soon draws] } Qa5 {...Be6 seems like a sorry concession, and in that line Blacks defense is not at all obvious! Instead, Black tries to play actively and exploit White's weak back rank. Alternative variation: [After] 27... Be6 [there follows the forced sequence] 28. Rhg3 Bg4 29. Nf5 Rg5 30. Ne3 (30. c4 [with all sorts of complications.]) 30... Bxf3 31. Rxg5  fxg5 32. Nf5 Qf8 33. Qxg5  Kf7 34. gxf3 [when Black probably can't play or a win given White's coordination and his open king.] } 28. Kc1 Qb6 {Threatening ...Ra1  and ...Qd4 , which is devastating if allowed unchecked. } 29. Qxf6 {This move is basically forced, but it is not immediately obvious. It defends against Black's mating net by covering f2 with the queen in a critical variation. } d5 {Also forced. Black has to defend somehow! Unfortunately, the endgame looks rather bleak with the obvious impotency of the e-pawn and White's clear threats on both flanks. Alternative variation: 29... Ra1  30. Kd2 Qd4  31. Rd3 [ and Qf2 is no longer on the menu, and Black is lost.] } 30. Qxb6 Rxb6 31. exd5 Bxd5 {and Black has simplified into an endgame that is objectively losing, but not completely hopeless if played against a human opponent, as his bishop is very active in defense. } 32. Rfd3 Be6 33. Rhe3 Rg5 34. h6 {The beginning of White's infiltration of g7, which is hard to stop. There are plenty of variations to consider in the following moves, but there aren't so compelling as Black doesn't have the resources to save himself after his next move. } Kf7 {The final blow. I was rather demoralized at this point, as White had played the game with brutal accuracy (I don't see a single slip in his entire attack) and Black basically defended just OK and reached an awful-looking endgame. Nonetheless, this move loses rather simply to Rg3, as Rg7  is clearly devastating and Black must use a tempo to defend. Alternative variation: [More tenacious is] 34... Kf8 35. Rg3 Rxg3 36. Rxg3 e4 [when the obvious] 37. Rg7 [draws, since] ([Of course] 37. Re3 Bd5 38. Nf5 [is more testing, among other options.]) 37... Rd6 38. Rxh7 Bg4 [threatens mate on d1 and also ...e3-e2-e1Q, which is just enough to hold.] 39. Rh8  (39. Rxa7 $4 Rd1#) 39... Ke7 40. Ng6  Kf6 41. c4 e3 42. Nf4 Rd1  43. Kc2 Rd2  [with perpetual] } 35. Reg3 Rxg3 36. Rxg3 Kf6 37. Rg7 Rc6 38. Kd2 {...Bxb3 was a threat. } Rd6+ {The only way to save the 7th rank pawns, as the rook will shift to d7 } 39. Ke3 Rd7 40. Rxd7 Bxd7 {Now we've reached a "pure" endgame, and Black is dead lost. Even with the active bishop and White's seemingly impotent extra pawn, White has a very simple winning plan. White can play on both flanks for passers, while his king occupies the unshakable blockade square e3. } 41. c4 {The first passer, on the queenside. } a5 42. Nf3 Bf5 {What else? } 43. Nd2 Bc2 {Trying to brew up tactical complications after an a-pawn march, and also tying the knight to b3 for a little. } 44. c5 {A little provocative, but Black can't catch this pawn with his king and also defend against the kingside pawns. He tries though! } Ke6 45. g4 Kd5 46. g5 Bf5 47. Nc4 a4 {The last gasp, but it's a decent try. Black gets a passed pawn for a millisecond, and White has to avoid a couple drawing traps. } 48. c6 {Alternative variation: [Much trickier is] 48. Nd6 Kxc5 [when White has to worry about snatching the bishop on f5 and allowing Black to gain a queen. It turns out that 49.Nxf5 is just fine, but anything else is simply a draw and certainly it is tempting to decline this sort of sacrifice!] 49. Nxf5 a3 50. bxa3 bxa3 51. g6 a2 52. gxh7 a1=Q 53. h8=Q } a3 49. bxa3 bxa3 50. Nxa3 Kxc6 51. b4 Kd5 52. b5 Kc5 53. Nc4 {1-0. Black resigned, as White's winning plan is bluntly obvious and of course ...Kxb5 runs into Ne6 . I am deeply impressed (shocked, frankly) by White's handling of this sort of Dragon position, as he himself is a Najdorf player. He constantly pushed for activity and attack, not slipping even a little bit at any point in the game. Not even a tiny miscalculation! Even though Black could have likely drawn a few ways, I played for activity (at the cost of sharpening the game and introducing the risk of losing) and basically ran into a brick wall. Very stressful! }
