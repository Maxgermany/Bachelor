1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {I consider this move to be weak (Philidor's Defence).} 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 b6 7. Bc4 Qe7 {The purpose of this Queen sortie I do not know.} 8. Qd2 Nf6 9. f3 O-O 10. O-O-O c5 {A pawn push, often made by weak players. Here, it's definitely a blunder.} 11. Ndb5 {Here's why.} d5 12. exd5 a6 13. d6 {Counterattacking is almost always better than retreating.} Qd7 14. Nc7 Ra7 15. g4 Ne8 {Black exchanges the annoying white knight.} 16. Nxe8 Rxe8 17. h4 Nc6 18. h5 Ne5 19. Bd5 Bb7 20. hxg6 {The h-file is open. That means trouble for Black.} hxg6 21. Qh2 Bxd5 22. Qh7+ Kf8 23. Nxd5 Nxf3 {Another gross blunder, capturing a hanging pawn. Black should be worrying about how to avoid getting mated.} 24. Bh6 {Black is busted.} f5 {A good try, but resistance is futile.} 25. Qh8+ {Taking advantage of the pin.} Kf7 26. Qxg7+ {Black resigns instead of 26. ... Ke6 27. Qf6#}
