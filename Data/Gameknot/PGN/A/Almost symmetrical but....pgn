1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. d4 {One of the classics answers to the Icelandic: ignore it. } exd5 {I do my job, and we are in a symmetric position. } 5. Bd3 {Grabbing f5. } Bg4 {Going to g6. } 6. Bg5 {Mimicyng me. I'm looking for something to unbalace the game. } Nbd7 {Leaving th dsb for c5. } 7. O-O {Threatening, of course, Re1. No problem. } Be7 {Lsb is fine here. In the future will come c5. } 8. Qd2 {That gave me an idea. I can take advantage of BxN inmediately, but maybe he is planning to take advantage of this column. Not so easy. I have another trick in my sleeve. } Ne4 {BxN, dxB, and Ne5 is not possible due to NxN (d4 is pinned to the WQ).} 9. Bxe4 dxe4 10. Bxe7 {White saw it, and counterattacks. To keep the previous threat, I should play NxB, but then, Re1 is very strong. If f5?, Qg5+} Qxe7 {Still not bad. } 11. Ne5 {Ng5 looks bad after f5 (now possible) or h6. True white still has Re1. } Nxe5 {I'll take the pawn. } 12. Qf4 {Interesting! White is winning back his piece with subtleties. Here, Nf3+, gxN, Bxc3 assures black a strong bind on the white king. g5 is not enough against Qg3, and nothing changes. Be2, Re1 just helps my opponent, so...} f5 {QxN was advisable, but black will have a better position. } 13. dxe5 {I am fearing h3, followed by Qxf5.} g5 {Infantry attack. It must get something!} 14. Qd2 {I can take the pawn, but... I still can, later. } f4 {Probably I must have played Rd8 at once. } 15. f3 {Interesting!!!! Of } Qc5+ 16. Kh1 exf3 17. gxf3 Bf5 {Not really to threathen c2, but to try to open the g column. } 18. Nc3 Rd8 {No way to castle. } 19. Qg2 Rg8 {Very risky. } 20. Qe2 {Rg1 was called for. This was a loss of tempo, but the position is already complicated. } g4 {Decisive move? Rg1 is on its way, but also is Kf7 (strenghtening Rg8).} 21. fxg4 {Big mistake, to open the white diagonal!} Rxg4 {If Bxg5, the WQ just slips away. } 22. Ne4 {? BxN+, QxB, true, but...} Qc6 {White should try to exchange pieces, but now he has to unpin the N. Rf3 was ok. } 23. h3 {This is the "problem-like" position. What would you have played?} Rd2 {If QxR, Qxe5+ and mate. } 24. Qxd2 Qxe4+ 25. Kh2 {Where's the mate? Ejem...} Rg3 {Here! Very interesting and nice secondary key. } 26. Rf2 {f2 will become the safest square for the K... What else can one suggest to white?} Rxh3+ {...and my opponent resigns, in sight of R/Qh1#. Nevertheless, a good fight. }
