1. e4 {I like this game - a) my opponent was my highest rating victory on GK b) It pushed my rating to over 1200 c) Well, it was a great game! :) I play as Black} c5 {Silican defence} 2. d4 {White immediately issues a challenge to the center } cxd4 {I accept the exchange, reasoning that I can gain tempo when White plays...} 3. Qxd4 {this! I immediately chase it away with...} Nc6 {Nc6 - development with tempo} 4. Qe3 {I prefer Qc3 here, as it keeps both bishops open - Other moves include retreating the Queen back, but with Q d3, the light square bishop is blocked, with Qd2, the dark square bishop is blocked (well, it is here too, but at least there's Bd2) and with Qd1, it's just a complete waste of tempo!} Nf6 {maybe 4...e5 would have been better here...} 5. Bd3 {?! I can't see the purpose of this move - it opens up some if White decides to play e5, but Bc4 or Bb5 seems better here} e5 {I make my claim to the centre} 6. Nc3 {developing the knight and possibly eyeing that d5 square} Bb4 {so I pin the knight to its king} 7. Bd2 {This is the usual response I get from White, and this can lead to a strong double attack from White if I'm not careful (a good example is my annotation, 'the f7 knight')} O-O {castling - simple enough} 8. Nge2 {Looking at this as I played this game, I saw White's defence as strong, and with more active pieces it had the lead in development. I had to do something....} d5 {so I do. White has to retake because of the pawn fork} 9. Nxd5 {I was expecting exd5 here} Bxd2+ 10. Qxd2 {Logical; White has free choice of where to castle, and wouldn't want to give that up} Nxd5 11. exd5 Qxd5 {and after that trade, the position looks a lot better for Black} 12. O-O {Castling queenside might have been better for White, but it was probably looking at the queenside knight when he made the decision Now, both sides have castled, White has a bishop, queen and knight developed, while Black has a knight, queen and pawn. Since I'm on the offensive, I decide to attack, but which one should I use?} e4 {I choose the pawn to attack with - I can push it forward and disrupt White's defence (though I don't see a chance to promote it, so I wasn't going to try)} 13. c4 {a counter-attack on my queen...} Qe5 {so I move it to protect the pawn, though I was planning to do that with Re8 anyway} 14. Bb1 {White moves his bishop away from danger...} Re8 {and I put more pressure on the e-file - soon Black's going to have good control of that e-file} 15. a3 {planning for b4 next move, I'd suspect - a pawn advancement to threaten my knight} e3 {pawn-and-queen fork - White has the option of exchanging queens with 16.fxe3 Qxe3+ 17.Qxe3 Rxe3, which slightly weakens the defence around the queen (though I'd have no piece to take advantage of the open diagonal to the king)} 16. Qc2 {I thought initially that this was just to keep the protection of the knight active, but there's another purpose which I don't see at this point...} exf2+ {as I annotate this, I considered Bg4 as a possibility, but that would be a mistake due to 17.f3} 17. Rxf2 {?! this move puts the rook in a bad place, but then again, Kxf2 seems bad as well, exposing the king} Nd4 {I keep up my attack on White, but I don't notice the counter-attack...} 18. Qxh7+ {nets a pawn for White, and gives White some of the initiative} Kf8 19. Nxd4 {? This would be White's losing move here - White needed to do something about that knight, because of 20...Nxe2+!, and White is going to lose material no matter what it does - if White doesn't take the exchange straight away, then 21. Kf1 Ng3+ 22.hxg3 Qe1+ 23. Kh2 Qxf2 and it's a knight-for-rook trade. If Kg1, then Qxb2 wins material as well (it's true you can do that with Kh1 as well, but the moves above also severely weaken the king's defence) best move here would have been Nc3, but accepting the exchange... (though it is customary to exchange when you're ahead in material)} Qxd4 {leads to the White rook being pinned. Black now threatens mate with Re1 (it all goes downhill for White here)} 20. Ba2 {The White bishop's only safe squares are a2 and c2 - everything else is an attacked square (though maybe White should have provoked an exchange with Bf5 - had Black chosen to accept White's queen comes to the aid of the rook) Kf1 loses to 20...Qd3 21.Kg1 Re1#. stops the mate in one but...} Re2 {! threatens mate AGAIN (21...Qf2+ 22.Kf1 Re1+ 23.Rxe1 Qxe1#) and White is really struggling to stay in this } 21. Raf1 {a forced move...} Rxb2 {and the rook grabs the extra pawn - with both rooks pinned to their respective positions, White doesn't have a lot of options...} 22. Qh8+ {!? except to counter-attack! I panicked when I saw the moves that followed....} Ke7 {I'd thought that White had managed to find a potentially genius counter-attack to an otherwise hopeless situation...} 23. Re1+ {all I saw at first was Kd7 and Kd6 at first, and the dangerous situation it puts my queen in - the Queen pinning the rook would be in danger of being pinned herself! ( 24. Bb3! would be very dangerous indeed) It took me a bit of panicking before I saw the other move...} Be6 {and now pressure's back on White with another threat of mate!} 24. Rxe6+ {?? I guess White must have been pretty damn desperate at this point - my guess would be that White wanted to keep up its attack on the King, but White needed the rook for defence around the king!} Kxe6 25. c5+ {A discovered attack...} Ke7 {and I return my king to its original square. The only move left to stop immediate mate now...} 26. Qh4+ {loses the queen!} Qxh4 {I was expecting g3 here (again, the only way to stop mate...)} 27. Rxb2 {But White doesn't do it! Maybe this was a way of resigning - a last strike...} Qe1# {before the inevitable mate! A very enjoyable game for me :)}
