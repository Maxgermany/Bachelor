[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {My favorite Scandinavian, that is not good. } 2. exd5 Qxd5 {Other moves are possible and possibly better. But the whole point for me is to "demostrate" that the principle of not to get out the queen so early is not always true... if you know what to do with it. } 3. Nc3 {The good move for white here involves d4 and c4, but most people plays this one, in the sensible principle that developing with tempo can't be bad. } Qe5+ {This check is done mostly because I want to retreat the queen in c7, after c6. Still, white has to think which defence is better. I think Ne2 is slightly better, since it support a near-to-come Bf4, but any move is good, here. } 4. Qe2 {This implies an early queen's exchange. I can retreat the queen, but it will be "hanging around", chased by white's minor pieces, all the game. And the "logic" Nc6 fails to QxQ, NxQ, Nb5, that threats Nc7+. The fork can be avoided only by Na6, that gives an unconfortable square (and game) for black. } Qxe2+ 5. Bxe2 c6 {This profilactic move is half-forced. The other way is e4 and after Nb5, Bd3, NxB, cxN. This can be playable, but I don't like to play without the bishop in a most likely endgame. Still, I have to find the right way to develop my pieces here, and it is still dubious black can make it to an equal position. } 6. d3 {d4 only helps me, because of Bf5, threatening c2. White tried (in countless previous games) either Bd1 or Bd3. The latter allows BxB and cxB. Incredibly enough, the doubled central pawns are not easy to attack, and I am not satisfied with the resulting game. Probably better is Bg6, where BxB, hxB provides me with a semi open column that whorts something - not much, to be true. } Bf5 {Anyway, just to bring out the piece so Nd2 doesn't jail the bishop. But e5 can be an option, trying to keep white's dsb out of the f4 outpost.} 7. g4 {Interesting and good. } Bg6 8. f4 {! First time (normal is h4, to which h5 leads to g5 and, even if I have to resolve the developement of the kingside minor pieces, tends to be pretty stable. Here, e6 is ok, but I kind of "panicked".} f5 9. h4 {!! Again, h5 is the wise choice, I simply blundered...} fxg4 10. Bxg4 h5 11. Be6 {...because of this strong outpost. Now, Bf7 - losing castling rights in an open position seemed dangerous to me, so I tried to untangle the position another way... but sweating cold.} Nf6 12. Be3 {Why not f5 at once? Of course, he wants to keep the tension, but this move just helps me: } Ng4 {I cannot see any reason against Bd4, and I am VERY cramped. Fortunately, he played...} 13. Bxg4 hxg4 {So I have two isolated pawns, not easily defendable... what a mess! :-(} 14. O-O-O Nd7 {Probably better e6. I wanted to counter a possible Bd4 with c5, but this is a bad plan, since it leaves the white knight very good squares. } 15. Ne4 {I can castle queenside, here. The motiv is after Bxa7, b6 closes the bishop in, and I can win it in a couple of moves... but this motiv, common in "my" Scandinavian, is not completely sure. What can white do in the meanwhile?} e5 {Trying to fight. } 16. Ng5 {From here, the knight can go to e6 for free. } Bd6 {Developing with threat. If Ne6, Kf7 should help. } 17. Ne2 {Defending f5. It is not wise for me to open the game, so...} O-O-O {If Ne6, I have to play the "sad" Rd-g8. But it appears to hold. The Bxa6 motiv is still "on". } 18. f5 {...but, in the hurry to settle my position by castling, I overlooked this. I cannot take because of Nf7, forking my rooks. } Bh5 19. Ng3 {g3 is impossible. I had to calculate quickly that maybe Be8 was better, the previous move. Oh, well...} Nf6 {By this, I make of Bxa7 a present for white. Another bad move...} 20. Nxh5 Rxh5 {My intention never was to take it with the knight. I only wanted to reach a kind of controlled position. } 21. Nf7 Rd7 22. Nxd6+ Rxd6 23. Bxa7 {And white cashes in, as I deserve. } Rxf5 {It was wiser for white to keep this pawn... anyway, white is still ahead, positionally.} 24. Bc5 Rd7 {Rd8 Be7 Re8 could be ok, but the threat of a free and advanced h pawn still hangs on my position. } 25. Rdf1 Rf4 {Well, if he wants to exchange, I will get two joined passed pawns. } 26. Be3 {Rf3, RxR, gxR is deadly. It undoubles the pawns, ok, but the f3 pawn is undefendable, and g2 becomes a target. } Ra4 27. a3 b5 {One never know... keep the opponent busy, so he distracts from finish you :-)} 28. Bg5 {Rf7 works, but he doesn't exchange, and my knight becomes pinned. So...} Nd5 {Fuzzing around (pointlessly) his king. } 29. Rf8+ Kb7 {Steel nerves. He "won't" get anything from this.} 30. Kb1 b4 31. Ka2 {Kb3, with the idea of Rd-a7 was an option, since the bishop check is shielded by Nc7. But it meant the fall of my g pawns, and the free ride of the h one. } bxa3 32. bxa3 {A knight check was a disaster, the king wins one of my pieces.} g3 {Last try. The rook can go to g4, defending it. } 33. Rb1+ {Here, not Nb6 because after Bd8 I have to defend with the rook (Ra6), and the pawn in g will be taken. } Ka7 {Steel nerves. I forsee in a glance (we had few seconds left) that it won't be checkmate. } 34. Rbb8 {The white's fatal blunder. Now, g2 is ok because after Ra8+, Kmoves, RxR is met by g1=Q. Still, I wanted to be sure, and played profilacticly.} Rg4 35. Rba8+ Kb7 36. Rfb8+ Kc7 {My rook move was a blunder, since now white has time to stop the pawn with a rook. Still, Nf4 would have been a win for black. But he played, with few seconds left...} 37. c4 {A blunder, since after Nb6 white loses material. Bd8+, RxB, RxR, NxRa8, RxN. } Ne7 {Counter-blunder, omitting the previous following. } 38. Bxe7 Rxe7 39. Rbc8+ Kd7 40. Rcd8+ Ke6 41. Ra6 g2 {The two rooks can chase the king, but they will go nowhere.} 42. Rxc6+ Kf7 43. Rcc8 g1=Q 44. Rdf8+ Kg6 45. Rc6+ Kh7 {End of checks and the game, one I deserved to lose but... it was funny to walk over the edge all the time just to see the king walk all over the board... to win. A last note: when you play RTC (real time chess), don't trust ratings such as "500" or so... they are normally not "true". }
