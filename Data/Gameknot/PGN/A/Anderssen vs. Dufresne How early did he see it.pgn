[White "Anderssen "]
[Black "Dufresne "]
[Opening "Evans gambit (C52), compromised defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {The Evans Gambit, sacrifice for stronger development and fierce attack on the center.} Bxb4 {Dufresne accepts the gambit, and takes the pawn with his bishop.  Taking with knight may cause amateur players, like myself, to take black's pawn on e5 with the next move, but this leads to disaster as black can play Qf6.  With that move, black threatens mate, but almost always wins a knight and pawn in the following moves.} 5. c3 {Anderssen continues to pressure black's bishop.  Standard Evans gambit moves so far.} Ba5 {Dufresne retreats his bishop to a5, a fine move, but more popular in today's play is Be7.} 6. d4 {Naturally, Anderssen begins his assault on the center, otherwise what's the point of sacrificing the pawn.} exd4 {exd4, the most common response.  Alternately, black could've played d6 for the Alapin Variation.} 7. O-O {Anderssen castles kingside, again part of the main line of the Evans Gambit.} d3 {d3!?, this is where Dufresne varied into what is now called The "Evergreen Game."  Anderssen had studied extensively pxp and the corresponding lines just one year earlier.  Perhaps Dufresne knew this and decided to throw a "kink" into his system.  Other moves popular in the Evans Gambit are d6, pxp, Nge7 or Bb6.} 8. Qb3 {Qb3, and White attacks Blacks King's Bishop Pawn.} Qf6 {Dufresne brings his Queen to f6 to defend the weak pawn.} 9. e5 {e5!, this move doesn't seem all that great, but I've read before that it is a trap} Qg6 {Qg6, again amateurs, if we could possibly ever make it this far, could incorrectly take the pawn leading to all sorts of problems.} 10. Re1 Nge7 11. Ba3 b5 {b5?!, here Dufresne offers his own sacrifice while attacking White's light-squared bishop.} 12. Qxb5 Rb8 13. Qa4 Bb6 {Black's bishop is almost back where it started... almost.} 14. Nbd2 Bb7 {Bb7, now Dufresne has to be feeling pretty confident by now, he hasn't castled, but his Queen is staring at White's King, and his bishops are looking great.} 15. Ne4 {Ne4, this is where I think Anderssen knows he is winning.  I believe he knows Dufresne's next move will be Qf5.  What I don't understand is, how?} Qf5 {Qf5, this is the move that confuses me.} 16. Bxd3 Qh5 {It seems like Dufresne wasted move on 14 with Qf5, perhaps someone can explain to me why.} 17. Nf6+ {I believe Anderssen knows he has won now.} gxf6 {Practically forced, Dufresne now has an open file for his rook, but it's too little too late.} 18. exf6 Rg8 {This is the final costly move for Dufresne.  It appears natural, but with Anderssen's next move, there is nothing he can do to stop the onslaught.  I don't know what would be better though, perhaps castling.} 19. Rad1 {The key move to the mating sequence, although I don't believe this is the point where Anderssen knew he had won, I think that was at least two moves earlier.  Unfortunately, he is dead and I couldn't call and ask him.} Qxf3 {Naturally, Dufresne is licking his chops!  He is saying to himself, "self, you have played masterfully and we are about to destroy this guy." ..........} 20. Rxe7+ Nxe7 21. Qxd7+ Kxd7 22. Bf5+ {Now we get to see the importance of the Rad1 move, not so much for the discovered check, but if it was not there, then Black could escape to c6 without the threat of checkmate, and Black would ultimately win.  Perhaps Dufresne saw this combination earlier too, but just assumed Bb5 , which would have led to victory for Black also.} Ke8 {Forced.} 23. Bd7+ Kf8 {Either way black goes here, the result is the same...} 24. Bxe7# {Checkmate.  I love games where the opponent is only one move away from mate, but then has to endure a drawn out mating process.  Going back to my original question: How early did Anderssen see the mate?  }
