1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. Nf3 c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. c3 Qb6 6. Qc2 e6 7. Nbd2 Nh5 8. Bg3 Nxg3 9. hxg3 Bd7 10. Rxh7 {A blunder, since I cannot relye on my queen's protection. You'll see why,} Rxh7 11. Qxh7 Qxb2 12. Rb1 Qxc3 13. Rxb7 {I though maybe there will be some compensation, but no way.} cxd4 14. Nxd4 Nxd4 15. exd4 Qxd4 16. Qb1 {Maybe Qh8 would have stopped him for a while. } Bc5 {I calculated up to Qf4. Not enough.} 17. Rb8+ Rxb8 18. Qxb8+ Ke7 19. Qf4 Qa1+ 20. Ke2 {The best defence was Nb1. After QxN, the mate is farther. } Bb5+ 21. Kf3 {I was dreaming of BxB, Qc7+, recovering it with QxBc5. But my opponent saw the right one. Almost for a puzzle. } Qd1+ 22. Be2 Qxe2# {Very nice, and deserved. }
