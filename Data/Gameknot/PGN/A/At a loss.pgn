1. d4 c5 2. d5 e5 3. e4 {Played irreflexively. It is better to take e.p.} d6 4. Nf3 {I am completely out of my known lines, so I am prepared to suffer in the opening. I sense this move is not the most accurate. } Be7 5. h3 {Losing time.} Nd7 6. c4 {Blocking in my lsb. } Ngf6 7. Qc2 {I sensed it was better to defend it with the Q, and leave the N to be more flexible.} Nf8 8. Be2 Ng6 9. g3 {Preventing Nf4, but debilitating my castling pawns. } Bd7 10. Nc3 Qc8 {I overlooked the theat to h6, but I think it is not all that bad to let him take it. } 11. a4 {To support a future N entry in b5, if ever Be7 moves... which is not likely to happen! I'm at a loss!} Bxh3 12. Ng5 Bd7 13. f4 {My king is wide open, but I can't allow myself into passivity. I have to create some play.} exf4 {I didn't want my dsb to be exchanged by the Ng6. } 14. gxf4 {He gets g4, true, but is it really useful for him?} h6 15. e5 {Time to open up the game. I don't have time to get my K saved. } dxe5 16. fxe5 Nxe5 17. Bf4 Ng6 18. d6 {Now, a curious tactic situation happens. If black takes my B, he can't take anymore the N or RxR+. } hxg5 19. Rxh8+ Nxh8 20. Nd5 {I want to bring my Q to h7. In order to do that, I have to get rid of Nf6.} Nxd5 21. Bxg5 {I can't hope to recover all the material, and I don't want a B to be able to land in f8. (This whole plan has a flaw: can you see it?).} Bxg5 22. Qh7 {...and I thought black had no escape from QxN# or Qg8#. But he has!} Ng6 23. Qg8+ Nf8 {Here, Qxg7 was the needed move in order to play Bh5 and go on with the attack. But I can't allow black a single move to activate, or to free his K position. If Qxg7 ...Qd8, Bh5 and black can play ...Qf6.} 24. cxd5 Bh6 {Ouch! My Q is trapped!} 25. Bh5 {Just a tempo to bring Ra1 in, please... :-)} Be6 {?? Thank you, black! g6, and I'm busted. } 26. Kf2 {The needed tempo to bring the R in!!!! } Bxd5 27. Re1+ Be6 28. Qxf7+ Kd8 29. Qe7# {Incredibly... lucky! Thanks for reading!}
