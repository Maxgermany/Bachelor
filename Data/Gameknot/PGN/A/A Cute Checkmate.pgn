[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 {Normal} e5 {Again normal.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Nothing odd so far.} d6 {Perhaps not the best move, but certainly not terrible.} 4. Nc3 {Standard development.} Bg4 {A perfectly plausible position to be in. Now its time for an epic queen sac to get mate.} 5. Nxe5 {?? Seems to just sac the queen as the knight was pinned.} Bxd1 {Gobble. Thanks for the free queen.} 6. Bxf7+ {Check. Oh dear black, it seems you have just fallen for my trap.} Ke7 {The only move.} 7. Nd5# {And checkmate. It is quite nice to see the minor pieces get a mate while the queen is sacked, when normally it is the other way round. To avoid this position, instead of taking the queen, black should take the knight on e5 with his knight.}
