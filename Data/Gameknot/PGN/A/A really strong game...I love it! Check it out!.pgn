1. e4 {This is a great game that i played few weeks....I started with e4.} e5 {He played e5...} 2. Nf3 {Typical.} Nc6 3. Bc4 {I like to play the bishop in that square..} f6 {f6? A weak move i think....Better would be Nf6..} 4. O-O {I castled....} g5 {And then g5? I don't think that's a great move...It makes king's side weaker...} 5. b3 {b3? I don't know what i was thinking really...I usually play d3 or c3...} g4 {g4? He continues to play with pawns and attack....} 6. Nh4 {I moved it in that square...I usually play with more defensive players...} Nh6 {Awkard move i guess....What do you think?} 7. d3 {To open the line for my bishop...} d6 {He does the same...} 8. Bxh6 Bxh6 {I decided to exchange our pieces to weaken more his king's side...} 9. Nf5 {This is the best place for my knight...} Bxf5 10. exf5 {So we exchanged them...} d5 {To push my bishop...b3 was a bad move in the beginning...} 11. Bb5 {Only place to go...} Rg8 {For pawn protection...} 12. Re1 {I guess that was a fine move but know i'm thinking of f3 as a better one....What is your opinion?} Qd7 {A fine move i think...} 13. d4 {Now d4 is coming...I was quite confused with that game, and didn't  have a clear plan in my mind...But so far i believe i'm doing quite good...} e4 {e4 then...He has a nice centre but his defence is not the greatest...} 14. c4 {Time to attack to that pawn...} Qxf5 {That was a logical move cause the pawn was exposed...But i found a nice plan in my mind!} 15. cxd5 {I took the pawn hoping to take it back...} Qxd5 {And he did that!!!} 16. Bc4 {Bc4! A nice move tha will give me advantage!} Qxd4 {The best think to do!} 17. Qxd4 Nxd4 {We exchanged our queens...} 18. Rxe4+ {But now the rook will do a great job!} Kd8 {Better would be Kf8...} 19. Rxd4+ {Nice move! Check and take a piece too!} Ke7 {He moved there...} 20. Bxg8 {I exchange my bishop for his rook...What do you think of that?} Rxg8 21. Nc3 {Now i open the knight releasing the other rook as well!} c5 {c5 will not help much!} 22. Re1+ {Check with the other rook!} Kf7 {That's better than Kf8...} 23. Rd7+ {Another check to push his king in the corner...} Kg6 {Nice!} 24. Re4 {I move my rook....His bishop is totally outplayed here....} f5 {For protection...} 25. Re6+ {Not a very nice move...} Kg5 {Better than Kh5...} 26. h4+ {Oups silly move!} gxh3 e.p. {I lost that pawn!} 27. g3 {g3 is better than gxh3 i guess!} Bg7 {Just a move...} 28. Nd1 {Now i have a plan for checkmate...} h6 {h6...} 29. Ne3 {Nice square for my knight...He blocks the g4 square...} f4 {f4??? i was expecting that move desperately!} 30. Rd5+ {Check and the game is over!!! I hope you liked it! It was a strange game for me but i think i responded and played pretty well... What do you think? Wait for comments and rating!}
