[Opening "French (C16), Winawer, advance variation"]

1. e4 e6 {Not often do I face the French, neither in correspondence play nor in OTB tournaments.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {My first official game with this variation, earlier I played 3.exd5 exd5 4.c4 but I switched to this variation because I often had trouble keeping my isolated d4 pawn and didn't think it offered much opening advantage to White.} Bb4 {The Winawer, which can get quite sharp and complicated in some main lines...} 4. e5 Ne7 {4...c5 is played more often here, I'm not sure wif it makes a lot of difference because the two often transpose.} 5. a3 {Forcing either a retreat or an exchange which yields me the bishop pair, but at the cost of a weakened queenside pawn structure and a tempo for development. In this case the exchange is by far the most often played, in the 4...c5 line Black has the option of choosing the sideline 5...cxd4!? 6.axb4 dxc3 and now not 7.bxc3?! but 7.Nf3! with good play for the pawn.} Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 b6 {!? A rare line, far more common is 6...c5, striking immediately at white's center. After some research I found out that the idea of this line is probably to play ...Ba6, exchanging White's strong Bishop for the 'French bishop' which is often a problem for Black, but considering the continuation of this game I'm not quite sure if Black was aware of the plan in this opening.} 7. Qg4 {I was out of book, but I decided to continue with what is considered the main line in the normal ...c5 variation and which is the most principled move in the position. According to the DB's this is also the main line here. It strikes at Black's g7 pawn and sets up an attack against the Black kingside.} Ng6 {The most played move in this position, but according to my coach this is a bad place for the knight, because it does nothing except for blocking off the Queen's way to g7. But probably Black can't let go the g7 pawn in this variation, because he doesn't have the quick counterplay like in the main line Winawer. Other moves would not be very good: 7...O-O is just castling into the storm, 7...Nf5 invites 8.Bd3 attacking the knight and threatening to remove the protection of the g7 pawn with 9.Bxf5 exf5, 7...Kf8 takes away Black's castling opportunity so the rook won't get into the game very soon and 7...g6 is just a weakening move. All in all I think this was the best move in the position.} 8. Bd3 {!? A logical move, but rare in this position. Far more common is 8.h4, immediately striking at the kingside and threatening 9.h5, removing the guard of the g7 pawn.} Nc6 {?! A new move, and probably bad. Black should really seek counterplay with ...c5 at some point and this blocks off that option, so Black would need at least one other move to make it possible. Here 8...Ba6 was played 9 times and 8...Qh4 twice, according to the 365chess.com database.} 9. f4 {Starting some action on the kingside.} Qh4+ {Probably Black tried to relieve the pressure by exchanging queens, but a strong attack is also possible without queens, as is shown in this game...} 10. Qxh4 Nxh4 11. g3 Ng6 {11...Nf5 puts some more pressure on the center and blocks of the f4-f5 advance. The disadvantage is that it can be chased with g4 at some point, but Fritz gives it as best.} 12. Nf3 Bb7 {This does not achieve much, the bishop is still as passive as it was on c8. Black should really be looking for some counterplay by now.} 13. f5 {Made possible by Black's last move. I had spent 7 minutes and 30 seconds here, my opponent had only spent 4 of his 20 minutes.} Nge7 {?! Allows me to create a huge weakness in the Black camp, which can be exploited immediately afterwards. Far better was 13...exf5 14.Bxf5 Nce7.} 14. fxe6 fxe6 15. Ng5 {! The Black kingside is under huge pressure and White is already winning either the h7 pawn or the e6 pawn.} Kd7 {Probably Black has to defend e6, it seems the most important of the two pawns that were attacked. Still I (and Fritz) think 15...Nd8 was a tad more accurate. That would also allow ...c5 to finally get some counterplay going.} 16. O-O {?! My only inaccuracy of the game, according to the computer. I realized just after I made this move that I could have taken on h7. Still this move maintains pressure and adds an extra piece to the attack, so it's not disastrous or anything...} Na5 {? Somehow Black seems not to realize his h7 pawn is hanging or is thinking he can get enough counterplay for it, but 16...h6 was really the only good move in this position.} 17. Nxh7 Nc4 {?! Way too slow. Black should take defensive action immediately with 17...Ba6! 18.Bxa6 Rxh7.} 18. Rf7 {! A very energetic and strong move. Black is virtually lost now.} Rag8 {?! Wrong rook, as we will see.} 19. Bg5 {! Of course. The rook can't defend both the e7 knight and g7 pawn at once. If 18...Rhg8 had been played, Black had been able to play 19...Rae8 now.} Rge8 20. Rxg7 c5 {Finally, but it allows a simple fork. However that could not be prevented anymore, because 20...Rhf8 simply runs into 21.Nxf8 and the knight is pinned so 20...Ng8 is not possible.} 21. Nf6+ Kd8 22. Nxe8 Rxe8 23. Bg6 {Another tactical blow which also wins the knight on e7 as the rook has to go away. After this Black resigned. I do think Black played below his rating, but nevertheless this was a very pleasing win, especially given my inexperience in this opening. I scored 3.5/8 in the tournament, with 1.5/5 against the 1700+ opposition (which could also have been 3 points) so I was very happy with my performance overall and my play. This was the highest rated opponent that I have ever beaten (excluding a simul in which I beat an IM, see another annotation of mine). Thanks for reading, feel free to leave some comments.}
