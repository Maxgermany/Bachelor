[Opening "Caro-Kann (B10), Hillbilly attack"]

1. e4 {Parsian had just beaten me on the white side of a Queen's Gambit Declined.  What followed was our second game, where the initiative in critical positions passed back and forth, and black was finally able to prosecute a classy win.} c6 {I often enjoy playing the Caro-Kann with the early bishop development, and which sometimes transposes to pawn structures reminiscent of the French defense. } 2. Bc4 {I know this isn't the book line, and it seems to develop a piece that is later going to lose tempo.} d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bb5+ Nc6 5. d4 e6 6. Nf3 Bd7 7. a4 {Looking a bit controversial.  The move has ideas of opening the a file if black moves the knight and takes on b5.  But b4 and potentially b3 are looking weak for white.} a6 8. Bd3 Nf6 9. c3 {Perhaps a second inaccuracy?  The move is shoring up the d5 pawn, but black is not threatening e5 at the moment.} Be7 10. Be3 {I'm not sure how good the bishop is here.  Maybe white should have tried to exchange off his bad bishop instead.} O-O 11. Qc2 Qc7 {And black has a very comfortable position out of the opening.} 12. Ng5 {So h7 is under a lot of pressure.  I considered this line, but it seemed black could defend.} g6 13. Nd2 Ng4 {The black side is under a lot of pressure here, and I wanted to get some pieces off the board to reduce pressure on my king position.} 14. h4 Nxe3 15. fxe3 Bxg5 16. hxg5 Qg3+ {And here it seems black has regained the initiative.  This was a fast game, and there was not very much time to calculate lines, so I think the white player may not have seen the end of the previous tactical sequence.} 17. Kd1 Qxg2 18. Re1 e5 {I played this move after some consideration, and I think it is a very classy move from black.  Black finally playes e5, with threats of e4 or exd, or the menacing bg4+.} 19. Bf1 Qxg5 20. Nf3 Qe7 21. Qh2 Bg4 {Black is two pawns up and appears to be maintaining the pressure.} 22. Be2 Bxf3 23. Bxf3 Qc7 {A controversial moves that introduces a lot of tactics into the position, with black's pinned e5 pawn.} 24. Rh1 Rfe8 {I thought that the black king was not going to get trapped here.} 25. Qxh7+ Kf8 26. Rh6 exd4 {Another classy move.  Just opening the center in an attempt to expose the white king, and opening the diagonal for the queen.} 27. Qh8+ Ke7 28. Qh7 dxc3 {White is in an uncomfortable position, since his attack seems to be slowing down.} 29. bxc3 {Trying to stop black's counterplay.} Kd8 30. Bxd5 {And this move allowed black into the game.} Qg3 {White has no useful checks here, and black has threats of Rxe3 or Rc8.} 31. Kc2 Nb4+ {A nice move from black.  This piece sac opening the c-file is black accepts.} 32. cxb4 Rc8+ 33. Kb2 Qf2+ 34. Kb3 {Allowing the crushing Rxe3#.} Rxe3# {}
