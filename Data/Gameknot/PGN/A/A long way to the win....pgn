1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 {I know you know I'lll go for this one. I'm not facing opponents strong enough to play correctly against it, so it kind of works. } 3. d5 {The second choice, leading to a completely different game from the Budapest I usually face (dxe, Ng4).} Bb4+ {Black must be careful not to be squeezed in, so I get the B into the game with tempo, prepared to exchange it, even for a N, for developement tempos. In my experience, I kind of "have to" play this way, giving my B pair for castling and d6, if don't want to go for a slow and squeezed game as black. Not my style (not on blitz, anyway!).} 4. Bd2 {Standard...} Qe7 {Getting my pieces out. Now, if BxB, QxB+, white has to play Qe2, and black is fine after, say, a lot of possible moves including a5, QxQ+, or Qc5 (heading for Ng4)} 5. a3 {Ok, you want the exchange, and I know that is nothing better than...} Bxd2+ 6. Nxd2 {He developed the N, I couldn't help it, but I am ahead in developement now, despite the nasty pawn chain. } e4 {! Sorry for the undeserved exclamation, but this is important. White can't attack trice the pawn, defenden twice. Black has it easy to play d6-Bf5. f3 is not playable, or e3. The Ng can't go to c3. Black is not any bad, isn't he?} 7. e3 {What else?} d6 8. Ne2 {White is not in zugzwang, either. He will develop slowly, and I have no quick attack to perform... do I? What would you say?} c5 {Controlling d4 (if Nf4, g5). If dxc6ep, Nxc6 helps me in developing. I don't fear Qa4+ or Qb3 while my lsb is ready to go to d7. White's supporting forces are too far. } 9. Ng3 {Controlling f5, right. Now, it is still a bit delicate to develop the Q side for black, dued to Qa4/Qb3. Not a real danger, but say Nd7, Qa4, o-o, b4, Nb6, Qa5... and maybe white has something to bother me for a while. } Bg4 {I can manage Qa4+ now with no major problems, since on the worst, my B can still come back to d7. And I can castle, for sure. (secretely, I DON'T want to castle, here: I want to attack! My pawn in e5 has now the power to make f3 unthinkable for white, so a bit vulnerable. I have to exploit those weaknesses, this is all chess's about, after all! :-)} 10. Be2 h5 {This is a doubled edged move. The principle of attack is met: instead of retreating, I "use" the exchange to bring another open line for my pieces, some kind of "keeping white busy". I foresaw Nxh5 wouldn't save white after BxB...} 11. Bxg4 {N or pawn? White has a Nf5 move that is strong because it attacks g7. The h4 "threat" doesn't help me much. } hxg4 {I can't avoid Nf5 (Qf8 is ugly, but the best). At least this keeps the WQ far from the Kside. } 12. Qc2 {e5 is attacked now trice, and it will fall. Too bad. I can live with it, and use the tempo in order to improve my position. I spotted that if Ng3 was out, maybe my pawn could sac in g3. Nothing more...} Nbd7 {Take e5, but now I'm developed, and you won't go for Qa5, since it is not his aim, obiously. If he does, I'll manage, I'm confident. He doesn't seem to have even though about that.} 13. Ndxe4 Nxe4 14. Qxe4 {Exchanging Q with a pawn less in such a position was a mistake, but I've spotted that....} Ne5 {..., thanks to g4 pawn, was safe. Now I still have to unravel myself, but I swear I can play it even after Nf5-Qf8. Maybe. Was I right?} 15. Nf5 Qf6 {Aha! Surprise! This moves sets a threat for the near future, after say castling... can you see it?} 16. b4 {Correctly, white attacks my weak side, and it's only matter of time it will be defeated. If the game opens on the Qside, I feel I'll be lost. I have to use the h column for the R, or I'm doomed. } g6 {This was my "save the say" move. } 17. Ng3 {Too bad for the "g3 plan", but hey, now I have a stunning and crushing move to play, but for my damn K is on the way. But if I take it away, I just allow the very, very dangerous bxc4, that threats cxd3, which will make my Ne5 a goner. I have a very short time to get out of this. Can you figure out how I did it?} O-O-O {...casting into the enemy's fire. But Kd7 left my K exposed to pawn's checks in a couple of moves, and this would have been very dangerous. Plus, I had a plan to slowen white's attack for some more moves. I have plans for his K...} 18. O-O {OH, dearest, I love you!!!! You gave a purpose to my Life on this game! You's tiying yourself just into the fire, and you just "follow principles"! (I'm not against principles alltogether, just pretend to make beginners think in it as in any other move: good or bad, a waste or a needed one, depending on the board, not to "principles"... ;-) Said that: to castle is normally good, and it's still to be recommended many, many times. In order to see someone that rarely castles, look into my games! :-D. Now: Black has a "straight away killer move" that seals white's fate in few moves. It's a "tactic-problem-like" situation: what is THE move? I missed it in the game.} Qh4 {No, it wasn't this one. It was Nf3+. White must take it with the pawn, then gxf3. Black threats Qh4, with Qxh2# to follow if, for example, Qxf3, Qh2#. Can white save himself? Rf-b1, for example, to make room for the K... So, I missed the "Tallish move NÂº1". I'm not Tal not even by far, just an admirer. But now, hey, Qxh2# is a threat, and white has only one move.} 19. h3 {Now, be careful: NOT gxh3, or QxQ and my attack vanishes. } Qh6 {Think, dear beginner, that g4 is safe: I threaten mate if the column is open. But I will be able to play gxh3 next move, opening up your K. } 20. bxc5 {You prefer to attack. Ok. My clock is running, but I'm not resourceless. Here, is gxh3 the best way to contiue? Can you tell?} Nf3+ {Ok. This was crushing before. Is it now? Can you tell me? Remember your answer for the very last move. I played it just out of instinct, or desperation (it was a blitz, unfortunately). I coudn't calculate everything. But I sensed that h2 would have been mine sooner or later. Not TOO late, I hoped... } 21. gxf3 {White can defend. If gxf3, Qxf3 and after Qxh3, Qg2 and white is saved. And if...} Qxh3 {? white has Qxg4+ (which I missed!), so the Q's will be exhanged, and my sac would have been in vain. I played an UNSOUND sacrifice. But if I'm not Tal, my opponent isn't Fisher either! :-)} 22. Rfb1 {He made room for his K, and correctly saw that my Qh2+ just went into nothing. I saw it, too. Here, a much better move for black would have been f5, but still it didn't go to anything concrete, as far as I saw, so I played...} gxf3 23. Qxf3 f5 {I'm not doing anything, really. In fact I helped him, since his Q is much more powerful there than in its previous position. Anyway, after Qf4, d3 was doomed, and with it, the game. This is the reason I played this one: I can't allow the white d5 pawn to move by ANY mean, or I'm lost. No Rd7 can help me against the coming c5 etc.} 24. c6 {I can't play bxc6 for the same reason I explained before. But I had (from the moment I castled long, in a way) that may strategy would have been to delay this attack as long as I could. I played...} b6 {He needs more moves now to break into my defences. It's up to me to find the way to win. Can I? What would you say?} 25. Qg2 {White knows that I'm down, and if I exchange Q's, all my hopes are gone. } Qh4 {I keep the threat on the h column, and I look to c4. } 26. Kf1 {?? Happy to release himself from the "h column latent threat", white makes a fatal mistake, overlooking...} Qxc4+ {I'm still -3, but now I feel the game is mine. Is it? What would you say?} 27. Ne2 {If Ke1 instead, Qc3+ keeps the checks game on. } Rh6 {No, I'm NOT defending the g6 pawn. I'm doubling R's on the h column, since you can see I can easily threat to make him sac his Q for a R, forcedly... of course you can see how!} 28. Rbc1 {"please note how black is ignoring the power or the two white pawns..."} Qa6 {...and drives his Q in an awakward place... but a R-safe one! d5 is still blocked, and if c7, Rd-h8 is my intention anyway!} 29. e4 {?? Ok, but... can white unravel himself and come out "alive" from this position? I bet "no", but I'm not sure. } Rdh8 {Still allowing his pawn's attack to proceed... but now the threat is concrete, and forces white into...} 30. Ke1 {only one, otherwise Rh1+ is crushing. } Rh6h1+ {Anyway. I have to do something "more" than Qa5+, or Nc3 could be the end of the story for me. I still have to be accurate, and on pressure... you know.} 31. Kd2 {Which is my "real" target? Which is the square that will decide the game in my favour? Where the war will be won or lost? White's weakest spot?} Qa5+ 32. Nc3 {Yes! Just what I wanted. Now...} Rh1h2 33. Qf3 Qc5 {...threatening Rxf2+, winning...} 34. Rcf1 Rh8h3 {...the "winner". Not easy to find, but probably more crushing that is seems at first sight until you note Nc3's weakness...} 35. Qe2 {What else?} Qxc3+ 36. Kd1 Rd3+ {Another "slam" move. White must give material back, but it's not finished yet. From here on is a "slaunt the rabbit" story.} 37. Qxd3 Qxd3+ 38. Ke1 {From now, the correct way to follow was...} Qxe4+ {Not this one. Qc3+ instead is more precise: white's K is forced out of the 1st rank, then Qb2+ forces is still farther, on 3rd, and from there my Rh7 could check... and so on. But I had no time left, and I went for him slowly but... mercisleely :-)} 39. Kd2 Qxd5+ 40. Ke3 {He helped himself out by himself, anyway...} Rh3+ 41. Ke2 Qe4+ 42. Kd2 Rd3+ 43. Kc2 Qc4+ 44. Kb2 Qc3+ {Rd2+, Qc2# worked too... Now, please come back and answer: was, ultimately, Nxf3+ a soudn sac, or wasn't it? Answer: if white hadn't blundered c4, probably the answer would have been "no". } 45. Ka2 Qc2# {}
