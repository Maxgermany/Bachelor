1. e4 e5 2. f4 {sets up the gambit} f6 {declines in what i must say seems like the worst way.} 3. Bc4 Nh6 {i must mark this move with a ? where is the knight going? it had no future on h6.} 4. f5 {i force the declination of the gambit now to lay in an attack on the king side.} d6 5. Qh5+ {a very powerful check.} Kd7 6. d3 {i want the check at f7 and the knight guards it so i must eliminate the knight. i also considerd nc3.} c5 {giving his king running room i think.} 7. Bxh6 {breaking the door down.} gxh6 8. Qf7+ Be7 {the queen was a better blocker.} 9. Nc3 {hoping for d5} Qe8 {proposing a trade in which i have no desire in.} 10. Qe6+ Kc6 11. Bd5+ Kc7 12. Nb5+ {this is actually a bad move, but black does not notice it and i got lucky, if he moves the king back to d8 i am alomst forced to proceed with nxd6,bxd6, qxf6 and my queen is safe.} Qxb5 {he took the free knight which was not free at all.} 13. Qxe7+ Nd7 {once again the queen is a better interposer.} 14. b3 {stopping any interference into my territory} Qb4+ 15. Ke2 Rb8 16. Nf3 {my knight sees a square he wants and has enough time to get there as black is busy falling over his own pieces, my knight wants c4.} b6 17. Nd2 Qc3 18. Rhc1 {gotta keep her out of my house} Ba6 19. Be6 {now that the bishop is gone attack the pinned piece} Bb5 {he guards it} 20. Nc4 {multiple threats. the only answer i see is qd4?? which results in c3!! and the black queen is lost.} Rbe8 {finally trying to push the queen out.} 21. Qxd6+ Kb7 22. Bd5+ Ka6 23. a4 {this move plays itself almost literaly, the bishop must now die the question is where to put the grave} Bxc4 24. Bxc4+ {notice that black's queen, the most powerful piece on the board is reduced to a lowly bishop.} Ka5 25. Ra3 {better was qxd7 as the threat of mate is unanswerable. i made this move because i wanted to do the b3 check and was trying to foresee the reulst of that check, my plan included next going qd5, then laying the check on and the queen would have to take then the rook goes to b3 and the queen and knig ar dead meat with mate on the move.} Nb8 26. Kd1 {after all of the previous notes go down someone needs to guard c3, in case of qb2} Red8 {another push} 27. Qc7 {this is another blunder because if rd7 white is forced to desperado his queen and prays to win her back with the check} Qb4 {black blunders here and gives the game away} 28. Qxa7+ {forced mate} Na6 29. Qxa6# {but all in all i think answering the king's gambit with f6 is even far worse then just accepting te gambit.}
