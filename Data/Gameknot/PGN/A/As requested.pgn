[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Torre attack"]

1. d4 {1.d4 opens lines for whites bishop on c1 and the pawn on d4 now keeps a eye on e5 advance, so a standard developing move. This move limits blacks strongest responses in the opening. eg 1.e4-c5.} Nf6 2. Nf3 {2.Nf3 gives support to the d4 pawn and keeps a eye on the e5 advance square.Places an extra hold on the g5 square which is been monitored by the bishop on c1.It is a good developing move.} e6 3. Bf4 {I wanted to play 3.Bf4 in order to develop it before i close the return home with a later possible e3.} c5 4. e3 Qb6 {I would of played 4...d5 4...or even 4...Nc6 are better developing moves. I do not like 4...Qb6 move played may be threatening a capture on b2 or a check on b4 or on a5 later to maybe create pawn structure weaknesses but this move is easily parried.} 5. Na3 cxd4 6. Nb5 { If black where to play 6...Nd5 then white been a pawn down and black attacking the bishop on f4 and possible doubling of pawns on the f file if white where to recapture the knight would be a bad choice of move and would weaken whites pawn structure and game so a plan of action needs to be formed for white here.Like recapturing the pawn on d4 with the Queen and entering the possibility of queen swaps and planting the b5 knight at some point on c7 and forking king and Rook to gain the exchange.} Nd5 7. Qxd4 {7.Qxd4 here regains the pawn and protects against blacks plan of taking the bishop on f4 leading to white doubling his pawns! so sort of makes black think of 7...Qxd4 swap offs to continue with the plan of taking the bishop on f4.} Qa5+ { This is a bad mistake by black of 7..Qa5+ the check is of no real gain.And the plan of blacks next move of possibly playing 8...Nxf4 9.Qxf4 is to prevent the possible Knight on b5 landing on c7 to fork the king and rook safe in the knowledge that the black queen on a5 cannot capture because of the defence from the bishop on f4 so a good idea to get rid of this threat and loose the black d5 knight for the bishop on f4!.However the plan is flawed due to the queen taking the bishops place and reinforcing the threat.} 8. c3 Nc6 { Black's game is now falling apart due to faulty logic and not having a clear plan of development! the move played 8...Nc6 is another nail in the coffin. } 9. Nd6+ { Let's take stock of the position now,White has 4 pieces developed open lines for the Bishop on f1 and if black attempts to take the Knight on d6 then rather than bishop takes back on d6 black can capture the g pawn attacking the rook on h8 and picking the bishop up later.One possible line could be 9...Bxd6 10.Qxg7-Nxf4 11.Qxh8-Ke7 12.exf4 doubling whites pawns.But here white has an easy game of it!.So best for Black would be to avoid thouse pit falls and play the best move for him with 9...Ke7 making the best of a bad job as the saying goes.And thus reminding white that his queen is hanging on d4 with the now attack from the knight on c6} Ke7 10. Qd2 {Black may now play 10...Nxf4 11.exf4 and succeeds with doubling whites pawns on the f file this normally would be thought of as a good plan as it creates known weaknesses like this in an end game scenario but at what cost here to black?.I think that exchanging an active Knight for a now spent Bishop is folly as the White queen again takes up the role of defence on the knight on d6 not that i would want a valuable piece taking this role on for long been tied to that would be folly also.  If black could offer exchange of queens at some point then it may help his cause!  If a queen exchange was offered after 10..Nxf4 11.exf4-Qd5 12.Qxd5-exd5 then after some Knight moving i would gain the pawn on d5 and taking me a pawn up.  } Nxf4 {And all this in the first 10 moves of the opening due to Blacks lack of development thought.One needs to understand the theory behind the well tied opening lines and build a Knowledge based on the style of play that suites the player.  Black's king is now stuck in the center and will soon loose tempo with subsequent checks forming a king hunt for white.  } 11. exf4 {So what is white's plan now? to hope for a queen exchange gain the upper hand of capturing a pawn chasing the king to the g file and castling queen side and storming the the black king on the king side classical chess plan.For eg. 11...Qd5 12.Qxd5-exd5 13.Nf5+-Kf6 14.Ne3-g6 15.Nxd5+-Kg7 16.h4-h5 17.0-0-0} f6 {11...Qd5 was the only way for black here the game now will be heavy in whites favour.} 12. O-O-O {The pawn is safe on a2 due to 12...Qxa2 13.Bc4 would be unlucky 13th move for black.  If we take stock of blacks game so far, the bishops have not been developed the rooks are still in there starting positions and the Queen due to the early ascent into the game with 7...Qa5+ is left isolated on the Queen side far from her kings defence.Black has a slight weakness in his king side pawn structure which is begging to be exploited by white.And the king is stuck in the center with no chance of ever castling.  So the point to the start of the game! Never make to many pawn moves in the opening unless forced or you have a concrete understanding of the opening employed develop fast with a view of where the pawns and pieces will be best placed for an endgame ie no doubling of pawns avoid isolated pawns and avoid to many exchanges leading to to many pawn islands.} a6 {12...a6 leads to the point where you shake my hand and say i resign good game,better was 12...Qd5 or 13..Qc7} 13. Nxc8+ {}
