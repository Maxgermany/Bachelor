1. e4 {In this light game both me and my opponent blundered, but the win was mine because of a psychological effect: I went on playing trying to create as many difficulties as I could for my opponent, and he wasn't accurate enough to properly defend / counterattack. So it went:} d5 2. e5 Bf5 3. d3 e6 4. d4 {? White gives me a free tempo. If he wanted to unbalance me, he's wrong, since I will go on just like planned, but with an extra tempo. } a6 {I "lose" it preventing Bb4+. Not dangerous, but the idea is to restrict white. } 5. c3 {A strong pawn chain I think I can attack. All this is calculated by experience through a number of games. } c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Qb6 {Attacking b7.} 8. Qb3 {The best.} Qxb3 9. axb3 {Now the game is all of it owns. A new situation for me. I am undeveloped, but I have to find the way to get meaningful developement. Be7 won't do. I have to be very aware of b5, since the a6's weakness will hurt me in the endgame. } cxd4 10. cxd4 {? Self-blocking himself, and isolating the doubled pawns (true they are safe, for now). } Nb4 {Not the Bishop. Because this move is much more threatening for white. I can't allow him to play his way. Bg4+ was just covered and my B would have been doing almost nothing, in this situation. I have other tricks in my sleeve. } 11. Kd2 {! Sensible. No good way to defend. Ra5 loses it, sooner or later. } Rc8 {This is "meaningful developement" :-)} 12. Nc3 Bc2 {!? I expected Ra3.} 13. Ne1 Bxb3 {If Ra3, Bc4 and the exchange is ok to me.} 14. Nd3 {A good idea is force white to exchange, but I didn't get my developement target, so I have to play aggressively and hope for the right moment to develop. } Nc2 {NxBe6 could be a good idea, intending to use h6 as a dev square for my minors. } 15. Be2 {??} Nxe3 {?? I was so sure he would have defended the R that I didn't consider he actually did not!} 16. fxe3 Nh6 {Now the N is safely developed here, with a good position (Nf5...) and my B is safe on b3. I was now so glad I didn't play b5!} 17. g4 {Fantastic. If g5, Nf5 threats Ng3 (if the h pawn is moved). } Be7 {Now this move is sensible. I have to remember, though, that this bishop is condemned to take the WN should it jump to c5. } 18. h4 {Wow! :-) I still don't fear g5, but I got "scared" and played...} g5 {? Sigh! Now I lose the posibility of a developement of my Kside, and my N is awakwardly placed. Nevertheless, he will save me later!} 19. h5 {Castling is possible, but f6-f5 are on the agenda...} Kd7 20. Rhc1 {Sensible: he doesn't want to allow a free b5 from my side. } Rc7 {Doubling R.} 21. Nc5+ {Just loses a pawn. Now, my B is free of duties on the Kside.} Bxc5 22. dxc5 Rxc5 23. Ra3 Bc4 24. Na4 {Creating complications. } Rc6 {I have weak darksquares...} 25. Bf3 {! Avoiding the B's exchange, thus the Nxg4 feared move!} Rhc8 26. Rac3 b5 27. b3 {Creating complications... and I fell like a goose. } Bxb3 {?? Loses the exchange with mate threat after...} 28. Nb6+ {!! Well spotted, White!} Rxb6 29. Rc3xc8 Bc4 {Only move to stop the mate, threatening the R at the same time. Unfortunately, it has plenty of room to go to. } 30. Ra8 {Rh8 was much better. I can't defend the Kside...} b4 {This is my last hope: promotion or its threat.} 31. Ra7+ {He can dance me around, but I will find shelter on g7.} Ke8 32. Ra8+ Ke7 33. Ra7+ Kf8 34. Ra8+ Kg7 35. Rc8 {White's journey was bad. Rh8 inmediately would have won. } b3 {Run, baby, run!} 36. Rb1 a5 {Some technique: now black can't advance the pawn or Kc3 wins it for free. } 37. Ra8 Rb5 38. Kc3 {It won't be easy to further advance my pawns, but they restricts white's movements a lot. It's time to bring in the cavalry.} Ng8 39. e4 {! The right attack.} Ne7 {! Just in time! (to support d5)} 40. Ra7 Nc6 {Yahoo, Silver! I adore Ns...} 41. Rc7 Nxe5 42. exd5 exd5 43. Bd1 {R far from a?} a4 {Another step!} 44. Re7 {? Ra7 would have been better.} Nd3 {Threatening b2.} 45. Be2 Nc5 {?? A blunder! a3 was better. } 46. Bxc4 dxc4 47. Kxc4 Ra5 48. Kb4 a3 {I know I'm lost. I can save the R, and it was probably better, but I thought the two joined pawns and the Nb3+ will do. } 49. Kxa5 {?} a2 50. Ra1 {Rf1, and he threats to annoy me a lot, but for I promote with check.} b2 51. Ree1 {They will!} Nb3+ {Nice ending, isn't it? My opponent resigned here.} 52. Kb4 Nxa1 53. Ka3 {}
