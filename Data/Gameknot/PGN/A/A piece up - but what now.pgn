1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It is one thing to win a piece and think that you are winning.  However, if your opponent chooses to keep his king upright you have work to do.  You may even start wondering, where do I go from here?  If your opponent has a higher rating from you you may even be tempted to hit that Offer Draw button, particularly if you have lost a "won" position three material points up (I am still haunted by that loss against Expert Charleshiggie!) against that opponent in the past.  However, before you get your mits on that Offer Draw button, it may well pay to take a deep breath, count to ten and start coming up with some kind of strategy, to perhaps make a move which you think will strengthen your position further so that you may force greater material gains, or even return some of the won material to simplify into a won endgame.  This is what Yours Truly ended up doing in this endgame.  The opening is, for the record, The Ruy Lopez.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. d4 exd4 5. Qxd4 {5. Qxd4 - after a pawn trade, out comes Glenda.  She cannot be taken due to the pin on the c6 knight by Fou Leblanc.} Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 {6. ..... Bxc6 - B for N trade.} 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Bg5 {8. Bg5 - pin.} Be7 9. O-O-O O-O {9. ..... 0-0 - both sides castle on the opposite side.  It looks as though there is gonna be a cut-throat battle but it doesn't happen that way in this game.} 10. Rhe1 Nd7 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 12. Nd5 Bxd5 13. Qxd5 {13. Qxd5 - after two further minor pieces are traded off, Glenda becomes further centralised and has her eye on the pawn on b7.} Qe6 14. e5 Qxd5 15. Rxd5 {15. Rxd5 - queen trade.} Nf6 {15. ..... Nf6?? - What's this, black walks his knight into the path of my e5 pawn which now perishes for the black steed, but I don't mind.} 16. exf6 gxf6 {16. .... gxf6 - black gets a pawn for his piece but his kingside pawn structure is absolutely busted.} 17. Re7 {17. Re7 - I had spent several moves wondering, where do I go from here?  Well, maybe giving my opponent a "Bone in the Throat" isn't a bad place to start.} Rac8 18. Rd4 a6 19. Rg4+ Kh8 20. Nh4 {20. Nh4 - with the idea of moving it onto f5 supporting the rooks on e7 and g7.} b5 21. Nf5 Rfg8 22. Rxg8+ Kxg8 {22. .... Kxg8 - I am very happy to trade off a pair of rooks as I am in front.  My rook remains on e7 tying down it's counterpart to the black pawn on c7.  If it moves then the rook can menace the other queenside pawns.} 23. Kd2 Kf8 24. Ke3 {24. Ke3 - time Henry took a bit of exercise.  As the BR is tied down to c8 then Henry is free to walk up the board where there are a lot of juicy p(r)awns on display.} Re8 25. Rxe8+ Kxe8 {25. ..... Kxe8 - the remaining rooks are traded off and now Henry marches into the centre.} 26. Kd4 Kd7 27. Kd5 c6+ {27. ..... c6+ - a natural move, driving Henry back but .....} 28. Ke4 d5+ 29. Kd4 Ke6 30. Kc5 {30. Kc5 - ..... Henry can be very persistent at times and where there is a will there is a way.  He even lets his counterpart devour some horsemeat so that he can tuck into those juicy p(r)awns.} Kxf5 31. Kxc6 Ke4 32. Kb6 d4 33. Kxa6 {33. Kxa6 - yum, yum!} d3 34. cxd3+ Kxd3 {34. ..... Kxd3 - Henry's counterpart is gonna feast on my kingside pawns but I have worked it all out.  Glenda will have made her appearance by then! } 35. Kxb5 Ke2 36. a4 {36. a4 - I now set up a series of conditional moves to illustrate the point of my last note.} Kxf2 37. a5 Kxg2 38. a6 f5 {38. ..... f5 - but he doesn't take the h pawn at once.  He is sending down his frontal f passer.  Thankfully the Wicked Witch of the West will not have time to make an appearance on the board, but it is a close run thing.} 39. a7 f4 40. a8=Q+ {40. a8/Q+ - and now Glenda does appear in a combo of smoke and a huge fanfare of trumpets.  She fixes her glare on the BK.  Black blocks the check with his f pawn but now Glenda moves to g8 on her broomstick and glares at the BK from there.} f3 41. Qg8+ Kxh2 42. Qxh7+ Kg1 43. Qxf7 {43. Qxf7 - two down one to go.} f2 {43. .... f2 - now then.  Interestingly enough, if it hadn't been for my passer on b2 the game would have been a draw due to the fact that I would have to either allow that pawn to crown or stalemate the BK.  Thankfully as I have that b pawn I can now sacrifice Glenda for the f2 pawn and then crown the b2 pawn.} 44. Qxf2+ Kxf2 45. b4 Ke3 46. Kc6 {46. Kc6 - up we go!} Kd4 47. b5 Kc4 {47. ...... Kc4 - the BK will not catch my passer!} 48. b6 Kb4 49. b7 Ka5 {49. ..... Ka5 - black is voluntarily putting his king on the side of the board hoping for a stalemate.  No chance.  Henry and Glenda know how to nail the BK.} 50. b8=Q Ka4 51. Kc5 Ka3 {51. ..... Ka3 - the BK tries to escape but Henry is in hot pursuit.  Henry will catch him and the BK will receive the kiss of death from Glenda.  Just before this can happen, black waves the white flag.  A good handy win which pushes me towards passing my previous best rating of 1858.  More to come but bye for now.  Joanne} 52. Kc4 Ka2 53. Kc3 {}
