1. e4 {Hi everyone!  GM Cyrano (Afro) asked me to annotate this game and another against his opponent, Akjoltoy who needs just one rating point to get to 2700 - wow!  I will give the commentary and hopefully somebody can provide a little deeper analysis, so here goes.   Afro opens with 1. e4 and his opponent responds with e6 which is the French Defense.} e6 2. d4 {3. d4 - pretty standard follow up.} d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 {4. e5.  This pawn advance is often played by white in the French Defense to exert a cramp on black's game.  However, black does find some ingenious ways of getting round the cramp!} c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 {6. bxc3 - B for N trade which busts up white's queenside pawns.} Ne7 {6. .... Ne7 - this is the way black usually develops the knight.  It then sometimes goes to g6.} 7. Qg4 {7. Qg4 - with a black bishop not defending g7 white usually attacks it with his queen to try and provoke a weakness in black's castled position by an impromptu g6.} cxd4 8. Qxg7 Rg8 9. Qxh7 {9. Qxh7 - black has neither played g6 or castled and allowed the WQ to inflict mayhem on his position.  It will be interesting to see what counterplay black has to this.} Qc7 10. Ne2 {10. Ne2 - Afro develops his knight to this square to prevent a nasty queen check on c3.} Nbc6 11. f4 dxc3 {11. .... dxc3 - recovers pawn loss and puts a crimp on Afro's queenside.} 12. Qd3 {12. Qd3 - back comes his queen and now that c3 pawn is starting to look vulnerable.} d4 13. Ng3 {13. Ng3 - clears the way for Afro's white square bishop to develop.} Bd7 14. Rb1 O-O-O 15. Be2 Nf5 16. Nxf5 exf5 17. Bf3 {17. Bf3- Afro has still not yet castled.  Instead, after a knight trade he elects to improve the position of his lsb.} Be6 18. Kf2 {18. Kf2 - hmm, with the queens still on he keeps his king in the centre.  Interesting.} Qd7 19. g3 Bd5 20. Bxd5 Qxd5 21. Re1 Rd7 22. h4 {22. h4 - Afro advances his h pawn in order to avoid a rook attack.} Qa2 {22. .... Qa2 - invasion!} 23. Rb3 Na5 24. Rb4 b6 25. h5 {25. h5 - Afro pushes on his passed pawn, but he could be leaving it vulnerable to attack.} Kb8 26. h6 Nb7 27. h7 Rgd8 {27. ...... Rgd8 - instead of tying his KR down to preventing pawn promotion, black elects to double his rooks on the queenside.} 28. Rc4 Rh8 29. Qxf5 {29. Qxf5 - Black's foremost f pawn drops off and now his rook is en prise.  Afro's passer is now defended by his queen.  Hmm, Glenda is often pressed into defending the peonage during my own games!} Rdd8 30. Qd3 Rxh7 31. Qxh7 Qxc4 {31. ..... Qxc4 - an interesting trade off and Afro loses his passer.} 32. f5 d3 {32. ..... d3 and a draw offer.  Hmm, at the moment, those two advanced black pawns on d3 and c3 are suddenly beginning to look a bit more menacing than Afro's passers.  However, I may be missing something.  I hope the Inquest Jury will enlighten me.}
