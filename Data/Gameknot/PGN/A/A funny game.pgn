[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 {At last someone that goes more or less like me!} c6 {I decided to play the "weirdest" move I could concieve, just for fun. } 3. e3 {Ok, no punishment, good new. } Nd5 {Second "weirdest". The idea is to control c3 to let my queen out. } 4. Bg3 Qa5+ 5. c3 {Now, I started to look for more "funny" moves. } b6 {...and, doing so, I almost trapped my queen!!!! If b4, I had to play Nxb4 in order to save it! A piece for two pawns... well... I am completely undeveloped, you know....} 6. Ne2 {He either doesn't see it, or he is so sure I am so crazy that I "must" have a winning plan, that plays very conservatively. This saves my queen to become trapped. Thank you, serg...} e6 {Again, this doesn't save me, but it looks as I have a plan on the dark squares. :-D} 7. Be5 {Develop, buddy, don't play foolish moves like this one...} f6 8. Bg3 Ba6 {What else to do with he lsb?} 9. Nf4 Bxf1 {Lose castling rights! (and make my queen much safer!)} 10. Nxd5 {Ah, you want to fork me! Well, YOUR knight will be trapped after, my bishop won't!} Bxg2 11. Nc7+ Kd8 {Maybe Kf7 was better.} 12. Nxa8 Bxh1 {¡Ñam! (read as: "gnam" :-). A little excercise: not to leave the knight escape!} 13. f3 {He is doing his homeworks, too... Now, Qf5 seemed interesting, but not enough to save the bishop, so...} d6 {First of all. 5 lined pawns in the 6th row. All my 8 pawns connected...!} 14. Kf2 Qb5 {Here the game loses interest for a while, due to a lot of oversight by white.} 15. Qxh1 Qxb2+ 16. Nd2 Qxd2+ 17. Kf1 Qxc3 {Or Qxe3, even better. } 18. Re1 Qc4+ 19. Kg2 Qxa2+ 20. Bf2 {Ok, the typical "won game" that I manage to lose. So think twice. The next move, white will go Ra1, and then Rxa7. The situation CAN become even dangerous - so be smart. } Qc2 21. Ra1 Qg6+ 22. Bg3 h5 {Now take the pawn, if you dare...} 23. h4 Qf7 {Ok, now I defend adequately the a pawn (a5 was not possible due to Nxb6, dear beginner, I trust you saw it before). } 24. Qb1 Qb7 {Can I take the knight the next move? QxN, Qxb6+, and if axQb6, RxQa8, so... yes, but I must know what will happen next. } 25. Nxb6 {The wise one is QxQ. In position like this, you have to take with the intention to simplify. So I played the "wrong" one, because I play for fun, and I bet it would have held. } axb6 26. Qa2 {Now, again, be careful. White is threatening Qxe6, so, what I have to defend? Is this more or less dangerous than a queen's exchange on a7 or a8?} d5 {This is the right one (not the only one, of course), no matter the black bishop can penetrate now.} 27. Bxb8 {Anyway, this is not good for white. But what else? Yes, Qc2, looking to get in via g6! If I Rh6, Bf4 and I am in a little big trouble. } Qxb8 28. Qa8 {I can avoid the exchange, but I think the result would have been the same, only more complicated. } Qxa8 29. Rxa8+ Kc7 30. Ra7+ Kb8 31. Rf7 {So he gets me cramped. But I have nothing to fear. Can you see the trick to get out of the cramped position? I'll show you later. But you have to keep in mind that the important piece is my king, preventing the white rook to get some of my pawns. } b5 {Wrong. The pawn won't reach the 8th before the white king.} 32. Kf2 {I already made my mistake. Now, let's do another.} e5 {If ever he dxe5, my c and b pawns will be free to go ahead and promote. } 33. Ke2 e4 {Oh, what the hell, I already know how to get free, so no problem in closing the rest. } 34. f4 Rg8 {This is the key move. } 35. Kd2 c5 {Now, the bishop can fly, g7 is defended. } 36. Kc2 c4 37. Kc3 b4+ 38. Kb2 c3+ 39. Kb3 {Ok, and we are at another standpoint. How can I make some progress? } g5 {The ONLY move (I can see) to break white! With +6!} 40. Rxf6 g4 {Or gxh, it is more or less the same thing. } 41. Rb6+ Kc7 42. Rb5 Kc6 43. Ra5 g3 44. Ra6+ Kb5 45. Ra1 g2 46. Rg1 Be7 47. Kc2 Bxh4 48. Kd1 Bf2 {No hope for white. } 49. Rxg2 Rxg2 50. Ke2 h4 {I decided to be a little sadistic here. } 51. f5 h3 52. f6 {I can stop the pawn, losing the rook, and win with the b and c pawns, but I like to be sadistic when possible. } h2 53. f7 h1=Q 54. f8=Q Qe1# {A funny game until the end, I think. }
