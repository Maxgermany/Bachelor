1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. c3 {attempting to strengthen the center against future punches at it, the main drawback is neglecting my development.} d6 4. Nf3 {Prefering to take a more solid approach than the more aggressive f4} Nf6 5. Bd3 {leaving me with the option as to what to do with my dark square bishop and my queens knight. Na3 is interesting in some positions} O-O 6. O-O {Na3 or Nbd2 also seem playable. I decided that i should wait and see how black would respond. With a mobile centre i prefer to castle early.} Nbd7 {preparing e5 to contest my centre.} 7. Re1 {in reply to threatened e5. after a possible exd4 by black the rook will be well positioned} a6 {black decides to march on the queen side, if he does not this might be regarded as a loss of tempo. It seems a bit dubious to march on the queenside without clarifying the center.} 8. Nbd2 {What to do here? i was thinking about a4 in respons to the threatened b5, but there again i welcomed blacks flank play. Also my dark square bishop is a bit of a problem. Bf4 e5 doesnt seem to good for white. Nor did i feel like Bg5 was accomplishing anything significant. Nbd2 seemed my best bet. with possibilities of moving it to f1,b3 or c4 depending on the demands of the position} b5 {black should strike in the centre. c5 looks better putting pressure on my centre, b5 allows the annoying reply a4} 9. a4 c6 {a blunder, but what to do here? taking on a4 doesnt look any good. Rb8 gives black the a file, and a awquard queenside pawn formation} 10. axb5 cxb5 11. Bxb5 {black looses an important pawn that he wanted to use to break open the queenside} Bb7 12. Bd3 Re8 {getting ready to blast open the center. blacks bishops have more potential in this position if he can open the center to activate them.} 13. Nf1 e6 {not quite sure why black didnt play e5 here. He might have disliked the reply Ne3 eyeing the weakened white squares c4 d5} 14. Ng3 e5 15. h4 {wanting to get a kingside attack going. I wonder if piece play with Qb3 isnt objectively stronger. It is probably better to clarify the center before attacking on the kingside} Qb6 {i think d5 was better. following the old axiom about countering flank play with center play.} 16. h5 Nxh5 17. Nxh5 gxh5 18. Be3 {proving the poor placement of the black queen. Qxb2?? Rb1 wins a piece.} Qc7 19. Nh4 Nf6 20. Nf5 Nxe4 21. Qxh5 {threatening Bh6 and Ngx7 Kxg7..Qg4 } Re6 {defends against Nxg7 but doesnt solve Bh6} 22. Bh6 {Rxh6 23. Nxh6  Bxh6 24 Rxe4 looks decisive. either the rook joins in the attack or white gets a massive attack with opposite colored bishops. }
