1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This game started off as a Dutch Defense in a thematic mini-tournament.  This resulted in closed positional play right until the latter part of the middlegame where I managed to win a pawn and go into an endgame with a pawn up.  You would think this ought to have been a straightforward win, wouldn't you?  Well, not quite - let's throw some opposite coloured bishops into the mix and things were not as straightforward as they seemed, even when I increased the advantage to that of two pawns the graffiti on my wall was reading "Low Draw".  However, before hitting that Offer Draw button, I decided to have one last throw of the dice but did it pay off?  Well, in order to find out you will have to read on ......} f5 {1. ..... f5 - this is the Dutch Defense and I have had mixed results with this opening.  It looks as though I will be leaving Henry exposed on the Fool's Mate diagonal, but in order for my opponent to plonk the Wicked Witch of the West on the h5 square, it is not as simple as it first seems.} 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 c6 4. e3 g6 {4. ..... g6 - this position is getting to be a little stonewallesque.  It sometimes leaves me really stuck for ideas and this is how I end up getting bogged down in the middle game.} 5. Nf3 Nd7 6. Bd3 Bg7 {6. ...... Bg7 - I complete the kingside fianchetto and the Fool's Mate diagonal is firmly closed off.} 7. O-O Nh6 8. h3 Nf7 {8. ..... Nf7 - not much happening.} 9. b4 e5 {9. ..... e5 - so I try and liven things up a little with a pawn break.} 10. dxe5 Ndxe5 11. Nxe5 Nxe5 {11. ...... Nxe5 - followed by a plethora of exchanges.} 12. Be2 O-O {12. ...... 0-0 - finally Henry is tucked away on the kingside.} 13. Rb1 Be6 14. Qd2 Nf7 15. Na4 b6 {15. ..... b6 - even with those exchanges I seem to be in a defensive mode.} 16. c3 Re8 17. a3 Ne5 {17. ...... Ne5 - I return my knight to its outpost.} 18. Rfd1 Qe7 19. Nb2 Rad8 {19. ..... Rad8 - lining my rook on the same file as the Witch.} 20. Bxe5 Bxe5 {20. ..... Bxe5 - B for N exchange.  Nice to keep the bishop pair.} 21. f4 Bg7 22. Qe1 Bf7 {22. ..... Bf7 - one move ago, white played the seemingly strong f4.  However, this has left Roger with a backward e pawn and now I sneakily discover an attack on it.  Glenda is getting her broomstick ready ......} 23. Rd3 Rd6 24. Bf3 Re6 {24. ..... Re6 - pile on.} 25. Nd1 Bh6 {25. ...... Bh6 - threatening Bxf4 as the e3 pawn is pinned to the Witch.} 26. g3 Bg7 27. Rb2 Rf8 {27. ..... Rf8 - I have a very subtle plan here to win that e3 pawn.  Where there's a will there's a way.} 28. Re2 Be8 29. Kg2 Bd7 {29. ..... Bd7 - step 2.} 30. Nf2 Bc8 {30. .... Bc8 - now I am threatening the rooks on the a6-f1 diagonal.} 31. Rd1 Ba6 {31. .... Ba6 - I play it anyway.} 32. Nd3 Re8 {32. ..... Re8 - pile on renewed.} 33. Qd2 {33. Qd2 - now I can start the exchanges which will alter the course of the game.  By taking off the knight on d3 I ensure I get the e3 pawn but the price I will pay is that I end up with opposite colour bishops.} Bxd3 34. Qxd3 Rxe3 35. Rxe3 Qxe3 36. Qd2 {36. Qd2 - there is a lull but there is one further set of exchanges to go.} Qxd2+ 37. Rxd2 {37. Bd2 - the queens.} b5 38. Kf2 Bxc3 {38. ..... Bxc3 - I take a pawn and end up with a material plus of two points but this is in no way a gimmie!} 39. Rc2 Bd4+ 40. Kf1 Re6 {40. ..... Re6 - protecting the vulnerable c6 pawn, but for how long?} 41. Be2 Kf7 {41. ..... Kf7 - Henry marches to the c6 pawn's aid but alas he doesn't get very far.} 42. g4 Ke7 43. gxf5 gxf5 44. Bd3 {44. Bd3 - Oh dear, now my f5 pawn is vulnerable.} Kf6 45. Kg2 Be3 46. Kf3 d4 {46. ..... d4 - protecting Fou Lenoir and blocking off the e file but I am still saddled with vulnerable pawns!} 47. Rc5 Bc1 {47. ..... Bc1 - my poor little f5 pawn is now a gonner.  However, Fou Lenoir goes for the white queenside pawns.} 48. Rxf5+ Ke7 49. Re5 Rxe5 50. fxe5 {50. fxe5 - now the rooks have been traded off and it really is an opposite colour bishop ending.  I decided to let the pawn on a7 go for the pawns on a3 and b4 and regain my two pawn advantage.  However, it does allow white to get a passed pawn.  The alternative was to play a6 but then Roger could always play Be4 and then my queenside pawns could fall.  So I decided Bxa3 to be the lesser of the two evils.} Bxa3 51. Bxh7 Bxb4 {51. .... Bxb4 - at least I have no less than FOUR passers on the queenside.  However, will any of them reach Glendadom?  We shall see!} 52. h4 a5 {52. ..... a5 - I can only try.} 53. h5 Bd2 54. Ke4 {54. Ke4 - centralising his king and going for the d5 pawn.  Fou Lenoir tries to protect it but finds himself on the next turn overloaded.} Be3 55. h6 a4 56. Bf5 Bxh6 {56. ..... Bxh6 - forced.} 57. Kxd4 a3 {57. .... a3 - just two more squares.} 58. Bb1 Bg7 {58. ... Bg7 - my last throw of the dice - a pin!} 59. Ba2 Kd7 60. Ke4 {60. Ke4?? - I think this is the loser.  Next move I play my winner - c5!} c5 61. e6+ Ke7 62. Kd5 c4 {62. ..... c4 - the vital a2-g8 diagonal is now blocked.} 63. Ke4 Kxe6 {63. .... Kxe6 - Henry snaps off Roger's final pawn and now three pawns down Roger decides to hit the resign button.  Here are his post game comments: "In my white game, disregarding the computer analysis, the move I thought lost it for me was #53. Instead of h5, I should have moved my K to Ke2. This would have stopped you B from guarding the diagonal including h6 for my advancing pawn. Of course, being several pawns down was a killer in end game". He will not be able to stop Glenda from appearing on either c1 or a1.  That's all for now folks but I will be back with another endgame where I have had to deal with stubborn resistance in a rook ending from a Class C Player by the name of Dan.  Until then have a good read and a nice weekend - Kind regards - Joanne}
