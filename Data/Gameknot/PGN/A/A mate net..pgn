1. b3 d5 2. Bb2 {Ok. This is nothing bad for white, he just looks for a transposition. But I decided to test his center...} d4 {Completely "out of principles": two pawn moves of the same pawn in the opening. Let's see if he can grab advantage from it. } 3. e3 e5 4. exd4 exd4 {Again at the same point. } 5. d3 {Of course, black can't hold this pawn for too long, but if Nf3, B or pawn c5. } Bb4+ {I'm glad if he plays c3: I will not have to protect anymore the pawn, and a piece will be pinned as a result. } 6. Nd2 {Ok. Now let's get rid of that pawn.} Bc3 {White will be very surprised. I will lose that pawn, but I think that the tempoes will be enough for me to compensate. } 7. Bxc3 dxc3 8. Nc4 {Ne4, and I would have been glad if he takes the pawn, and Qf6. Just to force him to play defensively. (Do not try this at home :-)} Qe7+ 9. Qe2 Be6 10. Nf3 {White has no easy way to take this pawn. } b5 {Crazy, crazy and crazy. If Qd4, f6. } 11. Ne3 {Well: crazy means crazy. } Qa3 {Another bad move. White can play Ng5, and I'll be in troubles. } 12. g3 {? He wants my Q to get apart from the game. } Qb2 {I accept. Do not do this: my Q is just off from the game. } 13. Qd1 {... W is defending again. } Nc6 14. Qc1 {Now it's my turn to get tempos. } Nf6 15. Bg2 O-O-O {Q will be exchanged, so this way I get rid of the dangerous diagonal, controlled by his N. } 16. Nd1 {Ok, now I have to exchange Q!} Qxc1 17. Rxc1 b4 {...and now, my brave pawn is solidly placed!} 18. O-O {...but I gave him the tempo to castle in a good position.} Rhe8 {Let's try to get something from the open column. } 19. Ne3 {This N has almost no squares to go...} h6 {Useless move, but I have no plan. Rd6, looking for Ra6, is just too slow. } 20. Rfe1 g5 {??? } 21. Nxg5 {Well spotted, white!} hxg5 22. Bxc6 {Nevertheless, his K is now more open. } Reh8 23. Nc4 {My Be6 is a solid shield, for now. } Rh6 {Doubling R...} 24. Bg2 {Not the best. } Rdh8 {Now, h2 it's very difficult for white to defend} 25. h3 {Well...} Bxh3 26. Bxh3+ Rh6xh3 {Ok. Now, the "old" thematic attack. g4, and the WK will be on a mate net. } 27. Kg2 Rh3h2+ {? ...but if g4, Rh1 will kill my attack. } 28. Kf3 g4+ 29. Ke3 Nd5+ 30. Kd4 c6 {Ok, he can play Nd6+ and Nxf7, but...} 31. Re2 {I saw Rh8-h3, for Rxg3. But this will allow his R to check... nope. } Rd8 {Threatening a discovered check with Nf4, taking his R. } 32. Kc5 Kc7 {! Everything holds in the black cage!} 33. Ne5 {Another fly square for his king. } a5 {! Closing the mate net. Now I can move my N. } 34. Nxg4 {Yes, take it, come on. } Rh5 {Another discovered check threatened...} 35. Re5 Rxe5 36. Nxe5 f6 37. Nf3 {...and now the great "finale": } Nb6 {...and nothing can prevent Rd5#. Simple, but kind of elegant. Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed it. }
