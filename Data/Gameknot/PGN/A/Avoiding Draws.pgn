1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 b6 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 O-O 7. Be2 Nc6 {The opening is fairly basic - Queen Pawn's game. Both sides strive to mobilize their pieces for future combat.  } 8. O-O Ba6 {Developing the bishop to an active diagonal. It also forces a resolution with the pawn on c4. } 9. cxd5 Nxd5 {A horrible miscalculation - black puts his hopes on the bishop on g5, but white has more tactics. } 10. Bxa6 Bxg5 11. Nxg5 Qxg5 12. Bb7 {Forking the knight and rook, which gives white the exchange. Notice black's light squared weakness. } Nce7 13. Bxa8 Rxa8 14. Nxd5 {Trading pieces when ahead in material. } Nxd5 {Now, a very technical part of the game has arisen. The position is equal and stable, except for a material advantage of white. White first starts with the mobilization of his rooks. } 15. Qf3 Qd8 16. Rac1 Rc8 17. a3 {Blocking the b4 square for black's strong knight. } Qd7 18. Rc4 {Doubling rooks on the only open semi-file for white. } Qb5 19. Qe2 Rf8 {This simply wastes a tempo for black. Note that the c4 rook is pinned by the black queen. } 20. Rfc1 a5 21. e4 {Finally removing the knight from its strong post. } Nf4 22. Qd2 {Freeing the rook and attacking the knight. } Ng6 23. Rc4xc7 {White now owns an open file, and has a positional and material advantage. However, there is still a whole game to win. } Qh5 24. Rc7c8 {Trading rooks. } Nh4 {Black obviously is attempting counter-play - the only chance in such a position. } 25. Rxf8+ Kxf8 26. f3 {This is a strong move by white - it supports e4, protects g2, and takes the g4 square away from black's queen. } g6 {Creating an escape hole. } 27. Qf4 {Black is now basically blockaded in, and white dominates the position. } g5 {Attempting a breakthrough, but weakening black's king-side.} 28. Qd6+ {Assault!} Kg7 29. Qe5+ Kh6 {Black is fully blockaded, but white needs to add the rook to the battle. And this can only be accomplished by opening lines.} 30. d5 Nxf3+ {A desperate sacrifice, but an excellent move by my opponent. The f3 pawn now becomes the target of the sacrifice, and white's king-side becomes exposed. White is forced to take.} 31. gxf3 Qxf3 {Threatening Qe3+. The best move is probably a movement of the rook, but I blunder, and simply defend e3, leaving me with the probability of endless check.} 32. Qd4 Qg4+ {The checks begin. } 33. Kh1 Qf3+ 34. Kg1 Qg4+ {By now, I realize that Kh1 leads to a certain draw, so my only way to keep fighting for a win is to give up the hard-fought rook. } 35. Kf2 Qf4+ 36. Kg2 Qxc1 {But now, white gains multiple attacking chances, and the initiative with that. Chances are roughly equal. } 37. Qf6+ Kh5 38. Qxf7+ {The material is back to 0.} Kh6 39. Qxe6+ {White gains a pawn and gets passed connected central pawns. Now, chances benefit white once again. } Kh5 40. Qf7+ Kh6 41. Qf6+ Kh5 42. Qf3+ {Preventing three-fold repetitions, and preparing for the march of pawns forward. White's queen also timely defends from the black queen's threats. } Kg6 43. Qe2 h5 44. e5 {Charge!} h4 45. e6 Qc8 46. e7 Kf7 {The pawns were barely stopped by black. However, I realize that by giving up the e pawn, I can win the pawn endgame. The rest of the game does not need much annotation. } 47. e8=Q+ Qxe8 48. Qxe8+ Kxe8 49. Kf3 Kd7 50. Kg4 Kd6 51. Kxg5 Kxd5 52. Kxh4 Kc4 53. Kg5 Kb3 54. h4 {The pawn charges into queens. } Kxb2 55. h5 Kxa3 56. h6 b5 57. h7 b4 58. h8=Q b3 59. Qa1+ {Timely stopping black's pawns, while moving the king closer.} Kb4 60. Kf4 a4 61. Ke3 a3 62. Qd4+ {Now, black is lost. } Ka5 63. Qc3+ Ka4 64. Qc4+ {Black resigns, 1-0. An excellent game, showing that to win games, possible draws can be avoided in favor of a risky, dynamic situation, which gives chances to both sides. }
