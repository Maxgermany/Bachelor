1. e4 {Hello everybody!!! I'm annotating this game bacause i liked it very much...It was from a tournament i'm still playing! So it started with e4.} c5 {I used to play e5 but now i'm playing my favourite Sicilian defence...} 2. d4 {He choosed that variation playing d4. Not bad but i think Nf3 would be better...} cxd4 {I took the pawn...} 3. Qxd4 {And he took it with his queen...} Nc6 {That seems logical...I actually never played this variation before, expept playing it in blitz games...} 4. Qe3 {He played that move but i think Qd1 would be more safe for his queen...} Nf6 {I opened the other knight...} 5. Nc3 {That move seems good..} e6 {I think this is the greatest move to play...What do  you think?} 6. Bd2 {Better would be Nf3 i guess...} d5 {And now i was between that move and Be7....My thought was to attack and play more aggresive than playing Be7 which seems more pathetic (i know it is a good move too)...} 7. e5 {And now he made the first mistake....e5 showed me i took the right decision before...he might ignored the threat that was coming from d4....} d4 {d4! That was a good move that will give an advantage early in the game being with a knight up for the rest...} 8. Qg5 {He's protecting his queen for sure!} dxc3 {And i took his knight...} 9. Bxc3 {He took the pawn...Now he wants my knight but i know if i'm gonna play logicaly i won't find some trouble...} h6 {So i played h6 which i think was the best move to do...} 10. Qg3 {He had to protect his queen..} Nd5 {And i move my knight in a safe place...} 11. O-O-O {That looks good...i was expecting something like this as his king's side seems still disorganized!} Qc7 {Looks good..} 12. Bb5 {I wanted to exchange our pieces but firstly wanted to play a6 which seems more defencing...He might moving his bishop away...} a6 {So a6} 13. Bxc6+ {And he accepted the exchange of pieces...} Qxc6 {I took that bishop...} 14. Ne2 {He played with his knight that move...What do you think? I knew he's goona move then in d4 square...} b5 {b5 looks fine to me...Now i cant move the black bishop to e7 as his queen is pushing the g7 square...} 15. Nd4 {I knew he's gonna play that move...} Qc4 {And i though that would be the greatest reply...} 16. b3 {That was his second big mistake..I really don't have any problem to exchange our queens, plus i would be up two pieces...} Qxc3 {So i took the bishop with no fear understanding that this game could be mine with two more pieces...} 17. Qxc3 {He accepted of course the exchange..} Nxc3 {and my brave knight took his queen and now was threatening both his rook and the a2 pawn...} 18. Rd2 {That was his third and biggest mistake...He simply ignored the checkmate that will come...Playing that move he just blocked his King and maked him die as soon as possible!!!!!!} Ba3# {And checkmate with my bishop that during the whole game was sleeping piecefully....That was the game! I hope you like it!!!! Wait for your comments and your rating and please if it's something to ask write it down or sent me a message....I also have to notice in my game that i did not play 0-0 in the whole game, something that is rare for me playing as black...Thanks for reading my annotation...}
