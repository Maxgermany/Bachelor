1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 {Standard first 4 moves of the accelerated dragon.} 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Nxc6 bxc6 {This exchange should benefit black. White spent three tempi to blacks one and brought the 'b' pawn toward the center where it can support a d5 advance.} 7. Bd2 {By blocking the queen d5 looks easier all the time and this is the natural break for black in this opening.} Qc7 {To focus on e5 and to make Nf6 possible without the reply e5.} 8. Bc4 Nf6 9. Qe2 d6 {With some thoughts about preventing e5 and perhaps posting a piece on g4.} 10. O-O-O O-O 11. h4 {With development complete white starts the normal attack down the rook file.} Rd8 {Black wants to play d5.} 12. f3 {I don't think the 'e' pawn needed supporting here.  Be3 would have prevented d5 and perhaps have allowed white to play Qd2 and use ideas from the Yugoslav attack.} d5 13. Bb3 dxe4 14. Nxe4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4 {If white takes with the 'f' pawn the black will play h5 and perhaps play Bg4 which will chase the rook off d1. Still this leaves the queen exposed and black has the only center pawn.} Bf5 16. Qf4 {If we exchange queens here I thought it would be drawish and I wasn't sure who had any advantage.} Be5 17. Qc4 Be6 18. Qe4 Bxb3 19. axb3 {Seems like white's attack should hit first but black tries to catch up.} a5 20. Rhe1 {I thought h5 would be better - you open the h file and swing the Queen to h4} Bf6 {Protect the e pawn and keep the queen off h4 maybe} 21. g4 {White wants the pawn on e7 and black will let him have it!  It would have been possible to take the pawn on h4 but 22. Rh1, Bf6 23. Qe3 and white's attack along the h file looks very dangerous.} a4 22. g5 axb3 {The threat is mate on a1.  There is really only one move.} 23. cxb3 {So now White get the e pawn.} Bg7 24. Qxe7 Qb6 {But black wants to attack and so keeps the queens} 25. Qe3 {Defending the pawn on b3 and again trying to trade queens.} Qa6 {Again mate is threatened. 26.  ..., Qa1ch, 27. Kc2, Qxb2 mate} 26. Bc3 Bxc3 27. Qxc3 {27. Rxd8 was better in order to eliminate the mate threat. Without the exchange of rooks the Queen had to capture otherwise black gets to mate in two.} Rxd1+ {Best is probably 28. Kxd1 after any check by black the king will be reasonably safe on c2.  At least I couldn't find any mate. BUT...} 28. Rxd1 Qe2 {Black gets to threaten mate again and there is really only one answer.} 29. Rd2 Qe1+ 30. Kc2 {With the White Queen on c3 the black rook must stay on the back rank.  } Qxh4 31. Qxc6 Rf8 {White is a pawn up but his king is still a long way from safe and capturing the c6 pawn actually can work in black's favor.} 32. Qf6 {White seems to guard his pawns and keep a critical diagonal.} Rc8+ {Black gets to use the open c file. 33. Kd1 may lead to a perpetual ( we were both short on time ) I couldn't find anything better although it looks like there should be.  33. Kb1 allows mate in four with white giving up the rook and queen. } 33. Kd3 Qh3 34. Ke3 {Ke2 was better allowing a retreat to d1.} Re8+ 35. Kd3 Qd7+ 36. Qd4 Qf5+ 37. Kc3 Rc8+ 38. Kb4 Rb8+ 39. Ka3 Ra8+ 40. Kb4 Qa5+ 41. Kc4 Rc8+ 42. Kd3 Rd8 {White resigns.  I hope you enjoyed the game please rate and help me out with comments.}
