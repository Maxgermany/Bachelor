1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. f4 Nf6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Bd3 Bg4 7. h3 Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Nc6 9. Be3 e5 10. dxe5 dxe5 11. f5 gxf5 {This game was played in the USA championship (1963-64) where Bobby Fischer-at the ago of 20-has won by winning all of his matches,which is a unique performance in the history of chess. The writer never annotates the opening-parts so the quote starts here:) "The opening is Pirc defense. For black,this last move gave the most opportunities."} 12. Qxf5 {"12.exf5 would give black chanses to fight back with 12...e4"} Nd4 13. Qf2 {"Fischer said that he was thinking about 13.Qxe5 Hg4 14.Qxg7!? Kxg7 moves which where a lot promising."} Ne8 14. O-O Nd6 {"Black is planning the move f5 which would free his position."} 15. Qg3 {"This blocks blacks planned move 15...f5 because 16.Bh6 starts a strong attack."} Kh8 16. Qg4 {"Again,blocks f5 move."} c6 {"16...c5 would have been a better defense."} 17. Qh5 {"Threatening 18.Bxd4 exd4 19.e5"} Qe8 {"Tricky move but not good. The best would have been 17...Ne6"} 18. Bxd4 exd4 19. Rf6 {"19.e5 wouldn't be good because of 19...f5. This is what black was waiting for but white's move was like lightning out of the blue. On the dinner held at the end of the competition a cake was served having this position in it."} Kg8 {"If 19...dxc3 than 20.e5 h6 20.Rxh6+ Kg8 22.Rh8+ Bxh8 23.Qh7#} 20. e5 h6 21. Ne2 {"Black resigned here,his position is hopeless." End of the quote. The annotation might be a bit boring but consider it my weak translation:) In hungarian it would sound a bit better but there is no big difference I think The goal was to show you an nice match,hope you like it.
