[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 {This game is slightly unusual in that it all ends with a pawn} d5 {I've had some success with the Scandinavian and I fancied another try this time} 2. e5 c5 3. f4 Nc6 4. c3 Qb6 {Adds more defence to d4.} 5. Qf3 {This is the move that diverges from the gameknot database. Alternatives there are d3, Nf3 which would be my preference and b3} Bf5 {Giving me the opportunity to castle} 6. Nh3 {I have some doubts about this move I was expecting a d pawn advance} e6 7. a3 {This move opens up a nice hole at b3 for my queen to aim at} c4 {Opening up the a7-g1 diagonal} 8. d3 O-O-O 9. Ng5 {Threatens a fork on f7 but this is easily parried} Bg6 10. d4 {Closes the centre which often makes knights more significant but here I am happy with my lsb, white's bishops on the other hand are more restricted} Nge7 {intending to go to f5} 11. h4 h5 {Keeps h6 as an option for my knight if it gets to f5} 12. Nd2 Na5 {Aiming at b3} 13. Be2 Nf5 14. Bd1 Be7 {links the rooks} 15. g4 Nxd4 {A knight sac to open the centre up} 16. cxd4 hxg4 {If white takes with his queen then I have Qxd4 and a chance to attack the exposed white king with my queen and lsb} 17. Qxg4 Qxd4 18. Nxe6 {Loses the knight as we will see} Qe3+ 19. Be2 Bh5 {I'm not sure here if Bf5 would be better as it leaves the way open for bxh4+} 20. Qg2 fxe6 21. Qf2 Qxe2+ 22. Qxe2 Bxe2 23. Kxe2 {I now have one passed pawn and whites a rook is going to take a couple of moves to get free. If I need to try to apply some pressure} g5 24. fxg5 Bxg5 {The bishop is immune due to hxg5 Rxh1 pinning the bishop to the rook} 25. Nf3 Be7 {Not wanting to exchange bishops as white will then be able to get his a rook free} 26. Bg5 Rde8 27. Nd4 Bc5 28. Nb5 Nc6 29. b4 {This is a mistake as it gives me two passed pawns} cxb3 e.p. 30. Rac1 b6 31. Bf6 Rh5 {better is h7 as this permits the rook to be blocked in with Bg5} 32. Rcb1 {The pawn is immune due to the fork on d4} a6 33. Nd6+ Bxd6 34. exd6 {This pawn is now going to be very difficult to defend} e5 {Limits the bishops options} 35. Rhc1 Kd7 36. Kd3 Rf5 {aiming at f3 to push the white king back} 37. Rcf1 Rxf1 {relieves the pressure on my advanced b pawn} 38. Rxf1 Rf8 39. Ke2 Ke6 40. Rb1 {Loses the bishop and makes whites previous move rather pointless} Nd4+ 41. Kd3 Rxf6 42. Kc3 Rf3+ {whites chances are dwindling rapidly} 43. Kb2 Rh3 {This was a wasted move as it achieves nothing} 44. d7 Kxd7 45. Re1 Kd6 46. Rf1 Rh2+ 47. Kb1 {Now I'm looking to get my knight to c2 so that I can advance my pawn} Nb5 48. a4 {mate is now inevitable} Nc3+ 49. Ka1 b2# {Checkmate with a pawn is not something I have often seen but I was quite pleased with this one.  Thanks for reading please comment and suggest improvements}
