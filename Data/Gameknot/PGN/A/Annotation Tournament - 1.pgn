1. d4 {In this game I get a good position, but I let it slide, but I think my opponent played very well - well above his rating!} Nf6 {This is a usual reply, preventing e2-e4} 2. c4 {and so it this, preparing Nb1-c3} g6 {He prepares to put his bishop on g7} 3. Nc3 {I prepare e2-e4} Bg7 {He plays the King's Indian Defence, c7-c5 or d7-d5 are usual here too} 4. e4 {So I seize the centre. } d6 {He prevents e4-e5, although Bobby Fischer showed that 0-0 was quite playable} 5. f3 {This is the Sämisch Variation, It is named after Friedrich Sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s.} O-O {This is usual} 6. Be3 {As is this} Nc6 {He develops} 7. Nge2 {and so do I} a6 {This is most common in this position, prehaps preparing b7-b5 should white play 0-0-0} 8. Qd2 {I develop my queen} Rb8 {and he further prepares b7-b5. This is the Panno Variation of the Sämisch. Black prepares to respond appropriately depending on White's choice of plan. If White plays 0-0-0 and goes for a kingside attack, then 7...a6 prepares ...b7–b5 with a counterattack against White's castled position. If instead White plays more cautiously, then Black challenges White's centre with ...e5.} 9. h4 {So I try an aggressive strike against his king-side.} b5 {and he strikes back aggressively on the queen-side. We have a very double-edged position.} 10. cxb5 {so I take} axb5 {He has to take this way, Rxb5 allows Nxb5} 11. Bh6 {and I go back to my king-side attack, hoping for, as Bobby Fischer said, sac, sac, mate. This position was reached in Vonthron, Horst (2335) vs. Heinl, Thomas (2250), which white won.} b4 {Black cannot afford to just wait for white's attack to break through. In the above-mentioned game, black tried e7-e5} 12. Bxg7 {I am thinking for myself now. Exchanging bishops seemed thematic, weakening his king-side.} bxc3 {This came as a surprise. Can't he see I can hang onto my bishop now?} 13. Qh6 {Qh6 is the only move not to lose a piece.} Rxb2 {This is given as a mistake in the post-game computer analysis (pmca), which gives the position as plus 1.4 for white now, compared with level after Nc6-b4} 14. h5 {I was playing for mate - and I thought I would mate him. Although not given as a mistake in the pmca, it gives as the best line for both sides as Rxb2 14. Bxf8 Qxf8 15. Qc1 Bd7 16. Nxc3 Qb8 17. d5 Nd4 18. Rb1 Rxb1 19. Qxb1 Qxb1+ 20. Nxb1 c5 21. Nc3, so maybe I should have grabbed the exchange} Nxh5 {This is also given as a mistake, pmca gives Nc6-b4 again} 15. g4 {Again, not given as a mistake 15. Nf4 Nb4 16. Nxh5 f5 17. Nf6+ Kf7 18. Bc4+ e6 19. Nxh7 Nc2+ 20. Kf1 Nxa1 21. Bxf8 Rb1+ 22. Kf2 Rxh1 23. Qxh1 is given as best for both sides, with plus 3.92 for white, as opposed to plus 2.53 after g4, so maybe g4 is a mistake? What do you think dear reader? } Nb4 {He finally plays it, threatening Nb4-c2 picking up my Ra1!} 16. Kf2 {So I step out of the way} f5 {With threats of f takes on g4 oe e4, and his Rf8 comes to life. I decide to pick up the exchange at last} 17. Bxf8 {So I take} Qxf8 {He takes} 18. Qxf8+ {I take} Kxf8 {he takes} 19. gxh5 {I take. I am three points up. He hasn't really got compensation for his material has he?} Ba6 {A difficult pin on my knight on e2. My Bf1 is now stuck protecting it, so uniting my rooks is impossible} 20. hxg6 {So I exchange, with a view to opening the h file for my Rh1} hxg6 {He takes back.} 21. a3 {I was afraid of his knight coming into c2, my rook moves, he plays Rb2xa2.} Nc2 {But the knight comes in anyway.} 22. Rc1 {This is where I start to lose it. Rd1 is needed. I was thinking, he takes on a3, I take on c3, and everything is fine for me.} Nxd4 {But this capture is much better. He has three units attacking Ne2.} 23. Re1 {So this is forced. Pmca give this as 0.75 to me, instead of plus 2.32 if I had played this one move earlier.} Rd2 {This looked very dangerous to me - how the heck can I stop the c pawn?} 24. exf5 {So I exchange} gxf5 {He takes back} 25. Rh8+ {I finally activate this rook, but pmca gives this as an error, giving this position as plus 1.74 to black. Instead Ke3 is only plus 1.} Kg7 {So he hits my rook} 26. Re8 {I hit his e pawn} Kf7 {He hits my rook again.} 27. Ra8 {Pmca gives this as my final mistake, and the position as plus 6.31 to black now. Instead the pmca is given as "only" 3.07 for Rh8. In reality, black is winning in both lines.} Bxe2 {So he takes} 28. Bxe2 {I take back} c2 {He advances} 29. Rc1 {I give up the bishop to try and stop the c pawn.} Rxe2+ {So he takes it} 30. Kf1 {Kf2-g3 would be equally hopeless, as he has Nb3} Rd2 {Threatening Rd2-d1+ and if 31. Kf1-e1 Nd4xf3+ wins. Time to resign I think. Pmca agrees, plus 8.71 to black now. Interesting how quickly I went from a plus position to a negative position. Many thanks for reading this, comments would be very much appreciated.
