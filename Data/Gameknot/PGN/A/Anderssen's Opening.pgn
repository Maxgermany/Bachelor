1. a3 {First move for the Anderssen Opening.} d5 2. d4 {I went for the center to try and gain center control.} Nc6 3. Nf3 {Reinforced my control of the center, protecting my pawn.} Bg4 4. Nbd2 {Moved my knight here because I am guessing he is going to try and take my knight on f3, so instead of moving a pawn and giving more advantage to him with gaps in my pawn structure, I set my knight on d2 to protect it.} Bxf3 5. Nxf3 {I was right, he took my knight, so I take his. :) } Nf6 6. e3 {Reinforcing the center once more.} a6 7. c4 {I am challenging his control on the center, hoping he takes my pawn and lets me take center.} e6 8. Qc2 {Instead he reinforces his pawn, so I reinforce mine with the queen.} Ne4 9. Bd3 {This is a good move I noticed afterward. Not only does this piece reinforce c4, it challenges his knight on e4.} f5 10. b4 {Not sure what I was doing here, but I feel like I was giving myself some room to breathe in my defense and reclaiming more tiles.} Be7 11. O-O {Castled.} O-O 12. Bb2 {Protecting d4.} Bf6 13. Rfc1 {Protecting the queen just in case. :)} Rc8 14. cxd5 {At this point I went ahead and took his center pawn because he had no idea what was going on, so I am now trying to secure the center.} exd5 15. Bxa6 {Trying to open some holes for possible future checkmate. (I had enough advantage already I could sacrifice some pieces because I knew he had no idea what to do against this opening.)} bxa6 16. Qxc6 {I saw a free knight, so I took it. :D} Rf7 17. Ne5 {Went to challenge his rook.} Bxe5 18. dxe5 {Again, he wasn't sure what to do, so he instinctively took my knight, so I took his bishop with my pawn.} Nd2 19. Rcd1 {Again, I have no idea what he was thinking here, so I just kept challenging his pieces and moving in for the kill (checkmate.) } Nb3 20. Rab1 {He tried to take my rook, so I moved it over.} a5 21. Bc3 {As Anderssen's Opening is not commonly played, it is considered an irregular opening. The move is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings. But lets get down to business. First and foremost, I would not recommend using this opening in serious chess play for three reasons: It doesn't develop any pieces for white, it doesn't develop the center for white, and it gives away your opening advantage. Luckily for me, I played this game in live chess, and I encountered a lower ranked player and if you look back I won in 21 moves only because they didn't know how to react to this opening, I am guessing because of how rare it is. But this is how you would play this opening, and again, I would not recommend this opening for tournament play as it gives away all of your advantage if you are playing a veteran chess player.}
