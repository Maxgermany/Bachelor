1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nxe4 {Of course white can't just take a knight for free here because of the subsequent fork.  4. Qh5 is the sharpest response, and leads to the so-called "Frankenstein/Dracula" variation, about which much has been written.} 4. Qf3 {4. Qf3 is not as sharp and not well-explored; the computer doesn't give it a terrific evaluation but I think it's pretty reasonable since it takes the game into unexplored territory, develops the queen early but to a reasonably stable place where it won't be harassed much, and pretty much forces black to accept a distinct lag in development in exchange for that pawn.  A typical and plausible gambit idea.} Nf6 {Black is thinking: Get as strong as possible in the center, since white's given up a central pawn, don't fall any further behind in development, and don't start any conflicts or exchanges until the center is strong and king is safe.  And of course don't allow the game to end with an ignominious 5.  Qxf7.} 5. Nge2 Nc6 {Safe, gets a piece out, controls central squares.  This and Be7 were the only plausible piece-developing moves.} 6. d3 {Opens a line for his remaining undeveloped minor piece and gets the best center influence possible from the queen's pawn.} d6 {Opens a line for queen's bishop and supporting the king's pawn.  Black's king's bishop was most likely to go to e7 anyway so it doesn't matter too much that it's closed in by the pawn.} 7. Be3 Bg4 {With the white queen on f3 and bishop on c4, black's knight is tethered to its f6 square, and not available to do any work, since the f7 square is exposed if it moves away.  7...Bg4 forces the white queen off the f file, and allows black to catch up one step in development.  The computer likes the odd-looking Na5 at this point, which seems strategically hard to explain.} 8. Qg3 Qd7 {8...Qd7 doesn't seem so great, but I think the ideas here were: (1) it makes O-O-O possible and (2) since the bishop on g4 can get forced to retreat in a variety of ways, an exchange of bishops on e6 is a possibility and if that happens, I'd like to make the recapture with the queen.  At least it's not demonstrably bad and consistent with black's strategic goals, and I don't see anything really better.  I think black has to be patient here.} 9. f3 Be6 10. O-O-O {10. O-O-O was the first really unexpected thing.  My instinct was to reply with 10...d5 and the computer says that's tactically the best thing here.  But the variations are complicated (well, to me they are!) and I found a lot of pits that I could fall into; probably one of the reasons for O-O-O was that it does put the white rook on the same file as the black queen, which has little room to move, and pawn exchanges in the center could lead to a discovered attack.  Since I couldn't calculate the effect of ...d5 with certainty...} Be7 {I played quieter and stuck to my plan of avoiding conflicts until I had more security.  Black's pieces are cramped for the moment, but there's the option of castling on either side and with good pawn advances, the pieces should come alive. } 11. Bb5 {Pins the knight, but more bark than bite to this move.} Nh5 {I thought a long time about the order of operations here.  The bishop on b5 can be pushed back with ...a6 and ...b5, which is clearly the right thing to do to it.  That means castling short is most attractive to black.  However, 10...Be7 did leave the black g-pawn vulnerable to capture by the queen.  By itself, that isn't a too-serious problem because it would be offset by a subsequent time-wasting (for white) retreat of the queen.  But pushing pawns on the queenside (hemming in the white bishop and advancing on white's castled position) means I would rather keep my pawns on the kingside intact.  Nh5 seemed the best way to get both a good kingside castled position and the queenside pawn advance.} 12. Qf2 a6 13. Ba4 b5 14. Bb3 O-O {This seems to realize black's strategic goals for the initial part of the game.  The position feels good, especially the black rooks' access to the queenside.  Black can claim strength in the center and a queenside space advantage.  The worst thing is that knight on the h-file which is the most obvious thing to attack.} 15. g4 {Yeah.} Bxb3 {The exchange disrupts the pawns in front of white's king; black is beginning to conceive of a real attack on that side.  Black is also procrastinating the annoying question of what to do with his misplaced knight on the other side, to be honest.} 16. cxb3 Nf6 {The only place to go!} 17. h4 {I was expecting 17. g5, which would have led to either ...Ne8 (pretty unpleasant, making both it and the f8 rook useless, although it would probably be able to reemerge onto d6 eventually) or ...Nh5 then maybe 18.  Qh4 ... g6 after which the knight is safe but useless.  So h4 was a gift! } d5 {I'm tempted to mark this d5! just because it's long awaited and makes absolutely everything easier, even though it doesn't start anything brilliant immediately.  It's well supported, controls the center, opens a line for the bishop, opens d6 for the knight if it needs to find a place, and will generally be a useful part of the planned queenside pawn advance.} 18. Bd2 {Presumably worried about ...d4 forking the white knight and bishop, but blocking the pawn advance with 18. d4 would be a tougher counter.} Nb4 {Threatens the white d-pawn - which can't save itself by advancing, due to the threat of ...Nd3, forking the white royalty.} 19. Bg5 {Allowing the rook to protect the d3 square is the only good idea.} d4 20. Ne4 {White's replies were limited.  The best thing might be countering with 20. a3 since the black knight on b4 is a pretty influential piece at the moment and exchanging it or forcing it to retreat might be the best white could get here.  The actual 20. Ne4 loses material and you can pause to think through the tactical possibilities here if you like.} Nxe4 21. dxe4 f6 {It's 21...f6 that really punishes 20. Ne4.  The bishop can't retreat to d2, since that would once again allow the lethal ...Nd3 fork.  But there's no good option, really, and not much point hashing out which is the least worst alternative.} 22. Nxd4 {This is arguably a good response in the situation because it creates a decision for black instead of an easy reply.} exd4 {...and that worked, because I didn't choose the best reply, tactically.  Capturing the bishop, fxg5, wins more material than capturing the knight.  On the other hand, the white bishop is not going to accomplish much even if it stays on the board, and this move creates an advanced passed pawn which is going to be well-supported and gives black a straightforward plan for the rest of the game.  (That plan is:  Pawns.  Advance them.  And don't do anything stupid.)} 23. Bf4 c5 {Space and protection of the passed pawn.} 24. Kb1 Bd6 {Attempted simplification, but white declines the exchange (which might have been good for him, actually; I'm not really clear about that, but I do like simplifying at this point.)} 25. Bc1 a5 {This is the part of the game where we push pawns.} 26. h5 a4 27. h6 axb3 {Black REALLY REALLY wants the a-file open now.  } 28. a3 {Note that 28. axb3 would lose; it would be mate in 2 beginning with ...Qa7.} g6 {Blocks up the h-file, holding up white's best line of attack.  White can't reply axb4 because of the still-present mate threat (...Qa7).} 29. f4 Nc6 30. Qg2 c4 31. g5 {It's just a race, now.} c3 32. Rdg1 b4 33. gxf6 bxa3 {...and from here black can play steadily to a win; simple safe moves will suffice and I didn't try to look for anything dazzling.  White does have a lot of heavy pieces and advanced pawns aimed at the black king, so playing safe still requires caution!  An oversight could have reversed the position quickly. } 34. f5 axb2 35. Bxb2 c2+ 36. Kc1 Bf4+ 37. Qd2 Bxd2+ 38. Kxd2 Rxf6 39. fxg6 Rxg6 40. Rxg6+ hxg6 41. Rg1 Kh7 {The computer says it's forced mate in 7 at this point; I couldn't calculate that far, but obviously it's a won game.   It was a very satisfying win.  Commentary in hindsight makes it feel easy (especially at this point!) but white posed a lot of problems throughout the opening and middle, and much of the play was guided by strategic concerns rather than tactical ones, which are "fuzzier" and more difficult to evaluate (or so I find it).  I liked white's choice of 4. Qf3, and I think 17. g5 would have made black's game quite difficult, so there's a lot of territory still to explore around this game.  }
