1. e4 {It is a long time ago I haven't annotated a game. I wish to do it here, because I tryed once again to play against my own style. Many times, I lose, this time, I won, but this was not the important thing. I think my opponent tryed special things too, especially around move 23 and followings. For this, I found this game interesting.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {these were the imposed moves. I must admit I would never play this as black. Neither as white as I never play e4...} 4. e5 Bf8 {I found this move in a database, I have to admit, and I really liked it, so I decided to try it. Isn't it why these tournaments are for? } 5. Nf3 c5 6. Bg5 f6 {From now, I am on freewheel. It is very interesting to enter into games where you never entered before. I  would nevere have dared to try this kind of configuration in another situation, too afraid to be trapped after 10 moves... or less...} 7. exf6 Nxf6 {Already planned to rook as fast as possible, with the f column open. Remarking my e-pawn is as weak as a lamb in front of the wolf.} 8. Bb5+ {this made me rethink my idea to put bKnight on d7.} Bd7 9. Ne5 Nc6 {the big fight already. The kind of thing we average players play chess for... and usually don't find...} 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Ba4 {I loved my pawns structure, though I must recognize it looks dreadfull.} Be7 12. O-O O-O {f-column, here i am.} 13. Ne2 {He didn't want to open the diagonal for my bishop for free I guess.} h6 {I decided to keep f-g-h for me alone. As you will see, it does not work.} 14. Be3 c4 {closing white clear bishop moves.} 15. Nf4 Qe8 {furious knight already looking for g6. Only need a little help to get there. I was afraid of the idea c3-Bc2.} 16. b3 {looks like he didn't see it.} g5 {so I put his knight out of the possibility to reach g6 ever.} 17. Ne2 cxb3 18. axb3 Ne4 {I thought it could be my turn to attack} 19. f3 Nd6 {I like this place too. The knight "sees" more than it controls many white squares around, and let the f column opened.} 20. Qe1 {g3 on sight.} Nb5 21. Bxb5 {i am not sure this is the best move. Maybe c4?} cxb5 22. Qg3 Rf7 23. Nf4 {woups, nice shot.Viewing again g6 and h5.} Bd6 {You go, I eat.} 24. h4 {this is saucy! ... but miscalculated.} Bxf4 25. Bxf4 Rxf4 {a piece up} 26. hxg5 {a pawn down} Rf7 {very indispensable} 27. gxh6+ {two pawns down! And what pawns! now white has a f-g-h pawns line to progress. Maybe it worths the knight after all!} Kh7 28. Qg5 {may be unnecessary as my next move is predictable. Better, I am sure, was Kf2 to make the rooks progress on 1-line.} Qg8 {I am open to liquid exchanges, baby :--)} 29. Qh4 {Of course, he is not, but have you seen now how many possibilities black has, with the initiative? f3 is weak, c2 is weak, h6 is viewable...} Qg6 {I am pointing now c2 -maybe better was to point on f3 with Raf8. But now, or I take c2, or i thrat the king.} 30. c3 Rg8 {So be it, it is the king.} 31. g4 {White prefers the counter-attack to prudent defense with the queen. I think the attack is better.} Bc8 {As i have nothing in threats right now, I have to protect my a-pawn.} 32. Rae1 {white seems a bit out of solution. I had some for him, but kept them for me, like Ra2-g2} Qd3 {this is becomint harsh to retain... I guess now black is clearly up.} 33. f4 {of course, white has to use their only strenghts: the pawns structure. But I am pretty sure white didn't use them as well as they could. Thought it was not that easy.} Qxc3 {destroying the other side. Is it risky?} 34. g5 {Looks safety, but it is very fragile, as h6 is falsely defended, for example.} Qxd4+ {and now f4 is pinned.} 35. Kh1 Rg6 {i didn't like very much the idea of Rgf8 followed by g6...} 36. Red1 { I guess the idea was to maintain black on its side.} Qe4+ 37. Kg1 a5 {i had to put the pressure on the other side, as there is nobody there...} 38. Rdc1 Bb7 {c-column temporarily secured.} 39. Rce1 Qb4 {I was wondering what was more important, and I decided: to maintain f4 on f4.} 40. Qg3 {White had the same idea: they want to move f5.} Qc5+ 41. Re3 {unexpected and potentially dangerous. rook auto-pinned} d4 42. Re5 {maybe one of white best ideas in the game. } Bd5 {and I liked mine too!} 43. Qe1 {finally attacking a column.} d3+ {But now the improbable d5 is on its way to queen.} 44. Kh2 Qd4 {testing f4 again. a5 is forbidden as then the rest of structure would crumble.} 45. Kg3 {the king at work!} d2 {nearly got it!} 46. Qb1 {pinning my rook... But poorly replied. Though, I must say I wouldn't have found anything to forbid the next moves now.} Qc3+ 47. Kg4 Qxb3 {hello!} 48. Qa1 a4 {securing the idea of an attack on a-column.} 49. Qd4 {as we'll see, this ends black hopes. Looks like it forbids d pawn to progress and threats it to be taken. But now the f1-rook is overwhelmed!} Bf3+ {the bishop is sacrificed to allow d1=Q. There is nothing much to be done. Maybe I would have played, personnaly, Kh4.} 50. Rxf3 d1=Q {another pin!} 51. Qf2 Qbd3 {a safetyness move; Maybe unnecessary, but I lost so many games by being unprudent.} 52. Ree3 {oh, this gave me the idea to the ending story.} Qf5+ 53. Kg3 Rxg5+ {opening by falsely sacrificing a rook.} 54. fxg5 Qxg5+ 55. Kh2 {Kh3 was worse, as Qh1 was lethal.} Qh5+ 56. Kg2 {To continue a little bit, Kg3 was necessary. Now, it is clearly over.} Qdh1+ {followed by 57. Kg3 Q5h4x}
