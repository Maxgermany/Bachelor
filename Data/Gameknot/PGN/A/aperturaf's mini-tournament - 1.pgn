1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 {French Winawer- Main line} Qc7 7. Nf3 b6 {The usual move here 7.. Ne7} 8. a4 Ba6 {Looking to exchange his usually poor "french bishop"} 9. Bxa6 Nxa6 10. Qd3 Nb8 11. O-O Nd7 12. c4 {Trying to crack open black's weak pawn structure, and centralized king.} dxc4 13. Qe4 Rc8 14. dxc5 Qxc5 {Much better is Nxc5 with tempo.} 15. Ba3 {Now I play this move, making black's developement difficult, with tempo.} Qc7 16. Bd6 {Another move with tempo...} Qc6 17. Qg4 Ne7 18. Nd4 Qb7 {Moving the queen away from the action.. tsk tsk} 19. Nxe6 {!} fxe6 20. Bxe7 {A nice tactical shot! Kxe7, Qxg7+ wins the game} g6 21. Qxe6 Nf8 22. Bxf8+ Kxf8 23. Rad1 {Threatening Rd7 with strong mate threats.} Re8 24. Qf6+ Kg8 25. Rd8 {Black resigns; he will lose a queen for a rook. Notice his h8 rook, and how useless it is. By not castling, this is what happened.  The game would likely end with Rxd8 Qxd8+ Kg7 Qf6+ Kg8 Rd1 with Rd8+ winning.}
