1. e4 d6 2. d4 c6 3. c4 Qc7 {What exactly the point is in moving the queen is beyond me. Perhaps Black is trying to get some diagonal action going.} 4. b4 Nf6 5. Bd3 Be6 6. Nc3 {Some major battles look to be ready to occur on the queenside 5th rank.} Bg4 7. f3 Bh5 8. Bb2 {White has a nicely built-up position, while Black's position is awkward, with that bishop hanging awkwardly. He is already paying for not having moved it back to e6 or d7.} Bg6 {He has already moved the bishop four times in eight moves - and more importantly, four times in a row. Black is wasting precious development time.} 9. d5 {Time now, finally, for some action.} c5 10. b5 Nbd7 11. Nge2 {Black's queen looks awfully squeezed, with only a retreat or a move to a5 to really save her if there is trouble to come.} e5 12. dxe6 e.p. fxe6 {White got a bit greedy here to open up what looked like a truly locked position. My rationale was that the stonewall was strong but didn't offer me many chances at victory. There's a bit of a vacuum that might be exploited by Black with some solid moves, although White generally controls the increasingly critical d5.} 13. O-O a6 14. Qc2 {Mostly a waiting move - White is reluctant to open up the a-file on his own volition.} a5 15. a4 {14...a5 was an absolutely calamitous move. The queen is completely strangled and not well coordinated with her pieces, and now White has effectively closed off any chances for Black to make a queenside advance. White's pieces are better situated for an attack on the kingside.} b6 16. h3 e5 17. g4 h5 18. g5 Nh7 19. Nd5 {Note the corresponding stonewalls - and see how many pieces White has on the fifth rank, as opposed to Black's lack of any from the fourth to first ranks. White has decided to leave the g5 pawn en prise to establish control over much of Black's soft underbelly.} Qc8 20. h4 {Note White's capitalization on Black's mistake - a simple move to d8 instead of c8 might have truly pressured White's position on the kingside.} Ra7 21. f4 Be7 {FINALLY an extra attacker on the g5 square, but not the more ideal queen, and the floodgates have already opened. The f-file, and with it the kingside, is ready to open up.} 22. f5 {22. Nxe7 Kxe7 23. f5 was also a possibility, removing a key defender without a convenient avenue to allow other Black pieces toward the field of battle, but White has chosen to prompt defensive dithering with his dominant knight on d5.} Nxg5 23. hxg5 Bxg5 24. fxg6 {The bishop on g5 looks rather weak here, while White's advanced pawn has future potential.} Bh4 {Suddenly White sees his position in a different light - a vulnerable king with his escape route suddenly gone. } 25. Rf3 Qd8 26. Ng3 Qg5 27. Kg2 {Nice save from White to salvage the position somewhat.} Bxg3 {Annnnnnnnnd no. Bad. 27...Nf6 opening the file up to the rook is much more helpful, or even 27...Qxg6.} 28. Rxg3 Qh6 {Also a wonder, as opposed to a move back to d8 to try to regroup.} 29. Bc1 Qxc1 30. Rxc1 h4 31. Rh3 {Black is in a major mess, with one of his rooks taken out of the game and his knight out of effective moves. Worse still, NONE of his pawns can move. To be fair, none of White's can move either, but his major pieces are positioned well to attack the f-file, with a modified Alekhine's gun possible.} Rh5 {Also a poor choice as opposed to a move to threaten the g6 pawn, which White has no effective defense for. As long as the rook's going to get into the open, why not open up a bunch more squares and get that pawn off the board?} 32. Kh2 Rg5 33. Rg1 Rxg1 34. Kxg1 {Black resigned here - and indeed must have made the decision to resign three or four moves before. What really condemned Black here was his dithering in the opening and White's aggressiveness, taking the fight to the fifth rank and cramping the Black formation. From there, Black's defeat just went down an inevitable road. White left the knight on d5 since move 19, the queen on c2 since move 14, and the bishop on d3 since move 5! They weren't needed - not enough to move them, anyway - as Black really beat himself.}
