[Opening "King's Indian (A48), Torre attack"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Until some three months ago I played the Slav against 1.d4, but I felt uncomfortable in the resulting middlegame positions so I decided to switch to 1...Nf6.} 2. Nf3 {The Budapest Gambit is now my main weapon against 1.d4, because it results in open positions, in which I feel more comfortable than in closed ones. But to get into the Budapest my opponent has to play 2.c4. Now I have to come up with something else.} g6 {I decide to play a Grunfeld defence... If my opponent allows this.} 3. Bg5 {!? Interesting move. White doesn't decide to play c4 and instead develops another piece. It's hard to reach a Grunfeld position now.} Bg7 {This had to be played anytime, because otherwise 2...g6 wouldn't make sense.} 4. e3 {Still no c4. Note that after 4.c4 I wouldn't be able to play 4...d5 to try to reach a Grunfeld because 5.Bxf6 Bxf6 6.cxd5 would win a pawn. I would probably have played 4...O-O and only play ...d5 after Nc3.} c5 {Now that my opponent refuses to play c4, I decide to move up my own c pawn. I'm suspecting my opponent won't play c4 at all and will instead go for a system with c3.} 5. Nbd2 cxd4 {Trying to open up the position a bit.} 6. exd4 O-O 7. Bd3 {This is the normal position for the bishop in this set-up.} Nc6 8. c3 {As expected.} d5 {I'm trying to get some play in the centre of the board as soon as possible, to try and punish White for his somewhat passive opening play. This will be hard though, because this system is very solid and White has no weaknesses.} 9. Qc2 {!? Interestingly, this has never been played before. All games we were following continued 9.O-O. The queen and the bishop are lined up on the same diagonal, but they're biting on granite now because there's only the well-defended g6 pawn to attack.} Re8 {Meanwhile I'm preparing my third thrust in the centre, ...e5.} 10. O-O-O {?! This is dubious in my opinion. the pawns on the other flank seem to form a better shield for the king. But there are four pieces around to help defending the king, so it can't be that dangerous, can it?} e5 {?! I'm a minor piece behind in development, but my center control is greater and my rooks both have a nice file to control (once the c8 bishop has moved, the a8 rook can go to c8). So I thought this break was reasonable, but the computers don't really like it as after 11.dxe5 Nxe5 12.Nxe5 Rxe5, White can chase my rook with 13.Nf3 Re8 and I'm also left with an isolated d pawn. Probably White has a small plus there.} 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Rhe1 {? This can't be good. White is voluntarily giving up the bishop pair in an open position? A strange decision.} Nxd3+ 13. Qxd3 Bf5 {Developing with tempo. White's king is starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. The computers don't like this move and suggest 13...Qa5 instead.. I'm not sure why.} 14. Qb5 Rxe1 {?! I was feeling a bit uncomfortable about the possibility of checks on the back row, that could slow down my attack.. probably that's why I exchanged.  Another reason was that I didn't want to lose a tempo if I'd play 14...Rc8 and my opponent exchanged twice on e8 with 15.Rxe8+ Qxe8 16.Qxe8 Rxe8 (this would make 14...Rc8 a loss of tempo). It seems illogical though, because I'm the attacking side and would want to keep as many pieces on the board as possible.} 15. Rxe1 Qc7 {This is a pawn sac, but in fact I'm already planning to sac more than just the isolated d pawn..} 16. Bxf6 {?! This is not the losing mistake, but a step in the wrong direction. It's obvious my opponent is planning to grab the d5 pawn (otherwise he'd never exchange this bishop for my knight), but that would be a blunder as we'll see later.} Bxf6 17. Qxd5 {? And there it is. It was even set as a conditional move, for the first time in this game.} Bxc3 {! My opponent had obviously overlooked this sac, or thought it was not dangerous. I can imagine this because it seems so strange to sac the fianchetto bishop. But in this case it wins and is by far the best move in the position. I knew I couldn't calculate all the variations, but it just felt right. In this case my intuition didn't let me down.} 18. bxc3 Qxc3+ 19. Kd1 {All forced. Now this is a critical position which deserves a diagram. Now there are three moves that seem to continue the attack: 19...Bc2+, 19...Bd3 and 19...Qc2+. Two lead to a draw, one wins.} Bc2+ {? The wrong one. This only leads to a draw. 19...Qc2+? also leads to a draw, similar to the game: 20.Ke2 Re8+ 21.Kf1 Bd3+ 22.Kg1 Rxe1+ 23.Nxe1 Qxd2 and this is a transposition to the game. Winning was the silent and beautiful move 19...Bd3! (well, I don't know if silent is the right term but we call a move that's not check and doesn't capture a piece a silent move in . Now there's the mating threat on c2 as well as the threat of 20...Qa1+.  I'm sure I'vDutch)e also looked at this move, but probably I thought that 20.Nd4 would be good. But then Black can also follow up with 20...Qa1+ 21.Nb1 Qxb1+ 22.Kd2. Relatively best here is 20.Qb3, but this also loses to 20...Qa1+.} 20. Ke2 Re8+ 21. Kf1 Bd3+ 22. Kg1 Rxe1+ 23. Nxe1 Qxd2 {These moves were, again, forced. This is another critical position. It seems as if White is in bad shape: his knight is under attack and there's also the back rank mate threat (e.g. 23...Qxd2 24.Nxd3?? Qd1+ 25.Ne1 Qxe1#). But this is not true.} 24. Qe5 {? It's only this move that lost the game for White. Right here, he could have forced a perpetual check. The first steps are logical: 24.Qd8+ Kg7 25.Qd4+. Now There are roughly three variations. Firstly, the king can go back to the 8th row, but then White follows up with another check on d8 etc. Secondly, Black can play 25...Kh6 but now the checks on d4 and h4 will force a perpetual. Thirdly, there's 25...f6. Now White follows up with 26.Qd7+ and Black can again go back to the back rank (when checks on d8 and d7 will do the job) or play 26...Kh6. On this move White can play 27.Qh3+ and here's probably what White missed: it would be absolutely horrible to play for a win with 27...Kg5?? because of the rooyal fork 28.Nf3+. This is why Black has to accept perpetual check here, too.} Qe2 {Forcing another exchange to go into either a queen ending or a bishop vs knight ending.} 25. Qxe2 {My opponent chose the latter. I suppose he didn't like the mating threats in the queen ending.} Bxe2 26. Nc2 Bd3 {Somehow I played this instead of my first plan, 26...Bc4.. Note that if I'd played 26...Bc4, White cannot defend the pawn with 27.Nb4? because of 27...a5 when the knight has to leave the pawn undefended.} 27. Nb4 Bc4 28. a3 {Releasing the knight, which was defending the pawn.} a5 {Starting to push my queenside majority.} 29. Nc2 b5 30. Ne3 {White should be starting to activate his king very soon, if he wants to keep any drawing chances.} Bd3 31. g3 Kg7 32. f4 Kf6 33. Nd5+ Ke6 {My king is coming closer and closer to the queenside to help its pawns to promote.} 34. Nc3 b4 35. axb4 axb4 36. Na4 Kd5 37. Kf2 {Finally the White king is approaching the queenside too, but Black is still winning.} b3 38. Ke3 Bf5 39. Nb2 {Blocking the pawn.} Kc5 40. Kd2 Kb4 41. h4 Ka3 42. Kc1 Bc2 43. Nc4+ Kb4 44. Nb2 Kc3 {Now that White needs all its forces to stop the b pawn, my king starts its journey to the kingside to grab all the pawns there. I had calculated that I'd be able to take the three kingside pawns before White can defend them.} 45. Na4+ Kd3 46. Nc5+ Ke3 47. f5 {Not much else to do... Maybe he was hoping I'd voluntarily mess up my pawn structure by taking 47...fxg5, but of course I won't.} Bxf5 48. Nxb3 Kf3 49. Nd4+ Kxg3 50. Nxf5+ {White chooses to exchange down into the pawn ending, which is easily winning for me (especially as I know the theory on pawn endings quite well), but the ending with minor pieces was hopeless as well.} gxf5 51. h5 f4 52. Kd1 f3 53. Ke1 f2+ 54. Kf1 {Blocking my pawn, but not for long.} Kf3 {! Precision 'till the end. This is the fastest way to mate. Also easy was 54...h6, but after 55.Ke2 Kg2 the White king can flee to the queenside and postpone the inevitable. Now White is in zugzwang.} 55. h6 Ke3 {But now the king is forced to the side of the board. White decided to resign here. Mate can follow like this: 56.Kg2 Ke2 57.Kg3 f1=Q 58.Kh2 Qf3 59.Kg1 Qg4+ 60.Kh2 Kf2 and ...Qg2# or ...Qh5# to follow. It was an enjoyable game to play, hope you also enjoyed my annotation.
