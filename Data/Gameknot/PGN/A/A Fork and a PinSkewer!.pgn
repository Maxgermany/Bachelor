1. c4 {This is a good example of how a chess game can suddenly change course mid-game. In this game I make two critical mistakes, the second of which quickly lost me the match} e5 {Reverse Silican} 2. Nc3 {my usual development....} Qf6 {and black brings out its queen?!?! a basic rule of chess is to never bring out the queen too early.} 3. g3 {preparing to bring my bishop to the long diagonal (I know there's a proper name for this but I forgot how to spell it)} Bc5 {Black's plan is clear now; Scholar's Mate. Not a potent attack if the opponent can recognise the danger...} 4. Nf3 {as it is easily countered } Nh6 {? that's not usually a good place for a knight... If Black wanted to develop it then Ne7 would be far more preferable} 5. Nd5 {attacking, putting my knight onto a good square and threatening a fork! (though maybe I should have moved my bishop first?)} Qd6 {this,Qd8 and Qc6 both work to stop the fork, but I prefer this because it keeps the queen active, whereas Qd8 wastes a lot of tempo for Black (and Qc6? threatens a discovered attack after Bf2, with the added danger of the knight playing Nf6 after that)} 6. Bg2 b6 {? bad move considering the position of Fou Leblanc... 6...c6 would be far better} 7. Ne3 {setting the attack up (I love the position of my knights here, btw :) )} a5 {Black also had the option of 7...Bb7 8. Nh4 Bxg2 9.Nxg2} 8. Ng5 {discovered attack....} Ra7 {but Black easily sidesteps} 9. O-O {protecting my king...} Qg6 {while Black goes for the attack, though I think it should have gone for more development} 10. h4 {protection for the knight...} f6 {but Black just launches a fresh attack!} 11. Ne4 {Nh3?? d6! (my knights are in a nice adjacent line again - something about this position looks really cool to me!)} Bb7 {threatening to win a piece...} 12. Nd5 {denied!} b5 {Black missed the...} 13. Nxc7+ {King fork! (do I keep saying that in my games? I'm thinking of making it into my own personal catchphrase! :P)} Kd8 14. Nxb5 Bxe4 {?? what was once a dangerous move is nullified by the obvious threat on the rook} 15. Bxe4 {I decide to exchange first} Qxe4 16. Nxa7 Qxc4 {Black grabs the pawn, but ultimately White has gained a rook and pawn for a knight (cancelling out the similar pieces on both sides - and that is how I use Maths in chess!)} 17. d3 {chasing the queen away....} Qa6 {(!) ouch! Black reclaims his lost material points (if I had forseen this move, then 17. e3 Qa6 18. Qf3)} 18. g4 {there's no way to save the knight, so there's no point trying.} Qxa7 19. g5 {an attack on the knight (I can aim to double the pawns on the h-file with 19...fxg5 20.Bxg5+, then...21.Bxh6 gxh6) } Ng4 {? a move which looks powerful on the outside, with a lot of pressure on the f2 pawn, but he should have played Nf5, because...} 20. e3 {(!) the pressure is immediately revoked, and a discovered attack that the knight has no escape from} Qb7 {no hope, no point trying} 21. Qxg4 Rf8 22. gxf6 {an exchange of pawns, benefiting White} Rxf6 23. Qxg7 {?? White is about to lose that material advantage - again!} Rg6+ {(!)} 24. Qxg6 hxg6 {equality is now reached once more - it's anyone's game right now} 25. Bd2 {connecting my rooks...} Qa6 26. Rfc1 {with hopes of doubling my rooks; the threat on Black's bishop forces it to move (26...Qxd3 loses to 27. Bd5+, then 28. Rxc5} Be7 27. Rc3 {?? this was with the idea of protecting the d-pawn, but...} Bb4 {Pin! or is it a skewer! I need someone to clarify me on that - I'm not too sure on the difference between the two} 28. Rc2 {best move, but...} Qxd3 {(!) I was expecting a bishop trade, but this was a nasty surprise - White's gonna be losing material no matter what it does! } 29. Bxb4 Qxc2 30. Bxa5+ Kc8 31. b4 {and now, after spending the game simply catching up with lost material, Black has pulled ahead} Nc6 32. h5 {a last desperate attack, hoping Black will play Nxa5, giving me a chance of promotion...} gxh5 {Denied! And now, with my bishop and pawn stuck in their positions and the queen in such a powerful position (Qb2) I resigned.}
