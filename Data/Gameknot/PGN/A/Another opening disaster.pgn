[Black "rjacobs (1618)"]
[Opening "English (A22), Bremen, Smyslov system"]

1. c4 {dmaestro opens with one of the most reliable and, usually, solid openings, the English Opening.} e5 {After reading an impressive game here on Gameknot, I decided to adopt the same approach, a Sicilian with colours reversed.  This abandons my habitual King's Indian response, so I'm in new territory here.  My recent opening experiments have been unsuccessful, so fingers are well and truly crossed.} 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 {The most successful Black move in this position, according to the database, not that I have much faith in the statistics therein.  Too often I choose what looks like the most successful line only to discover that my opponent chooses a continuation that gives him a much higher winning percentage...} 4. Bg2 O-O {Black has castled in only four moves.  Now he cna concentrate on attacking White's relatively undeveloped position.} 5. Qc2 {Avoids doubled pawns if Black decides to swap on c3 and develops the Q, which eyes h7, but does nothing to help the King castle.} Re8 {Lining up behind the e-pawn with a longer-term view at hitting the King or the KN if it comes to f3 in a normal developing move.} 6. Nf3 Nc6 {deprives White's KN of the d4 square} 7. O-O h6 {and now deprives it of the g5 square} 8. Rd1 e4 {forcing the N either to retreat to d1 or to the rim on h4} 9. Ne1 Bxc3 {The pawn on e4 was attacked by three pieces and only defended by two, so this move removes one of the attackers and diverts one of the others.} 10. Qxc3 d5 11. cxd5 Nxd5 12. Qc2 Nd4 {Forks the Q and the pawn on e2, which cannot be defended.  White's back row is in disarray and Black's knights are dominating the whole board.} 13. Qb1 Nxe2+ 14. Kh1 Qf6 {and White had had enough.}
