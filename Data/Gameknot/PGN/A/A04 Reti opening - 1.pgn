[Opening "Reti v Dutch (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {Trying out Reti as white, a closed opening, against a stronger opponent.} f5 {Not a common response, called "A04: Reti v Dutch."} 2. g3 {I respond with g3.  Apparently, the stronger responses are b3 or b4.} Nf6 3. Bg2 d5 4. d3 e6 5. O-O Bd6 6. Nbd2 O-O {Through a roundabout way, we wound up coming back to a more "standard" looking Reti opening, i.e. 1. Nf3 e6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 Bd6 4. d3 f5 5. O-O Nf6 6. Nb-d2 O-O (A04: Reti opening).} 7. c4 {My logic here is that I gain a slight advantage if he takes the c pawn with his d pawn.  He can't advance to d4 because of my knight at f3.} c6 8. cxd5 {Although this amounts to a trade of pawns (no advantage), I take it anyway, probably out of a sense that I'm playing a stronger player.} Nxd5 {I feel this weakens the castle unnecessarily, particularly when cxd5 is just as good if not better.  As a result, I gain a slight advantage in that I retain a pawn in the d file.} 9. a3 {Buying time and countering the presence of the bishop.} e5 {Seems like a logical move as it sets up pressure on the knight at f3.} 10. Nc4 {Sometimes, I like to trade my knight for a bishop.} Re8 {He doesn't object to the trade.} 11. Nxd6 {So I take the trade.} Qxd6 12. e4 {Offering what looks to be a more powerful pawn (fxe4 dxe4), but this sets up a trap in that his Queen is unprotected.} Ne7 {He avoids the trap.} 13. b4 {Buying time, developing some space.} fxe4 14. dxe4 Qxd1 15. Rxd1 {Queen trade accepted, and I gain control of the d file.} Bg4 {Good pressure move.} 16. h3 {Go away or trade!} Bxf3 {He opts to trade.} 17. Bxf3 {17 moves in and I have two bishops against two knights.  As long as I watch for forks, I feel I'm in a good position.} Na6 18. Bb2 {Pressuring the solo pawn.} Ng6 19. Bh5 {Similar to his earlier move, only in reverse.} Kf7 {I can see why he did this, because he avoids stacked pawns, at least at this point.  But ...} 20. Rd7+ {Hello!} Re7 {His best move.  No slouch here.} 21. Bxg6+ {So, at this point, I figure I'll take what I can get, which is stacked pawns.  Here were my notes from this point, which came true up to his response in move 23. 21.	... 	hxg6 22.	Rxe7  	Kxe7 23.	Bxe5 	Kf7 24.	Rd1 	Rg8 25.	Rd7  	Ke6 26.	Rxg7 	Rxg7 27.	Bxg7 ( 2)} hxg6 22. Rxe7+ Kxe7 23. Bxe5 {Finally, a pawn advantage!} Re8 {I expected a move to protect his g pawn, but he apparently overlooked it.} 24. Bxg7 {Easy pawn.} Kf7 {Ahead 2, I'm happy to trade, even if it's a stronger pawn for a weaker one.  So, I set up to take the a7 pawn.} 25. Bd4 Rxe4 26. Bxa7 {I don't know that I had a clear win, but he probably wasn't too happy about giving up that second pawn.  If we had continued, I would have tried to get the bishop and rook to work together on a weak pawn.  Good game kansaspatzer!}
