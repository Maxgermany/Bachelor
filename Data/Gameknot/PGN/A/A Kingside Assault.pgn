1. f4 e6 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. e4 {From a fairly unorthodox sequence of moves, next I take the center.} a6 4. d4 d6 5. c4 g6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. e5 {This move blocks off the black bishop's activity completely, and leaves me with a very strong central pawn.} d5 {Not giving up the e4 square.} 8. cxd5 exd5 9. Bd3 {With black's pawn on e6 missing, a future P-f5 seems like the best and most obvious plan for white.} Nge7 {Preparing Bf5.} 10. O-O O-O {This was probably a mistake, since black's king will fall under heavy attack on the kingside.} 11. Be3 Bf5 12. a3 {Preventing Nb4.} Bxd3 13. Qxd3 Nf5 14. Rac1 Re8 15. Na4 {Advancing on the queenside. Notice that black has virtually no counterplay because of my strong,supported e5 pawn.} Bf8 {Preventing Nc5. But the knight will come into play later...} 16. Bf2 {I want to play P-g4, but it is first necessary to prevent the knight from moving to h4. } Kg7 17. g4 {Now, a direct, effective assault ensures.} Nfe7 18. f5 {Forward!} gxf5 19. gxf5 Kh8 20. Ng5 {A natural continuation: while the pawn on f7 is undefended, the knight is activated without the loss of initiative.} Kg8 {The king is forced to return. Now, the g-file seems promising, but it will take some time to fully exploit. Another idea is P-f6, but the problem is that black's knight returns to g6 and my attack is ruined. So I choose...} 21. Nxf7 {...this powerful sacrifice! It turns out that my central pawns will keep rolling forward, while black's pieces are too unwieldy to help.} Kxf7 22. e6+ Kg7 23. f6+ {Sacrificing the pawn, to keep the momentum and open the f-file for the rook. Retreating with the king will lead to P-f7, which should eventually win for white. So black takes the pawn, but the end is even quicker.} Kxf6 24. Bh4+ {Now, both the bishop and rook are in play!} Kg7 {24. ... Kxe6 leads to 25. Nc5+  (here is where the knight comes in!) Kd6 26. Rf6#. But this move also loses. Notice how the black pieces are passively watching on, while the black king is struggling beneath the white pieces. } 25. Rf7+ {Now, white will checkmate the black king with Qxh7# next move. So, black resigned. 1-0 An effective game that shows the progression from a positional advantage to a mating sacrifice.}
