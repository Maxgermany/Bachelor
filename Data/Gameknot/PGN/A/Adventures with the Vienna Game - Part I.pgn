[Opening "Vienna gambit (C29)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {The fact alone that I live in Vienna myself makes that opening very attractive for me ;-)} Nf6 3. f4 {Alright, let's experiment, this is called the "Vienna gambit (C29)".} exf4 {Instead of taking, more common is 3... d5.} 4. Nf3 Qe7 {My pawn on e4 is attacked...} 5. e5 {... so let's go for a counter-attack on his knight.} Nd5 {?} 6. Nxd5 {Of course, I take the free knight and attack the opponent's queen at the same time.} Qe6 7. Nxf4 {Again taking material and attacking the queen.} Qf5 8. d4 {Defending the knight and occupying the center.} Qe4+ 9. Qe2 {Being ahead of material, I don't have anything against a queen exchange.} Qxf4 {??} 10. Bxf4 {There falls the queen.} d5 11. O-O-O {11. exd6 e.p.+ would also have been a very nice move.} Bf5 12. Qb5+ {Now that the point b7 is undefended, I exploit that.} Nc6 13. Qxb7 Rd8 14. Qxc7 {Qxc6 would have been better, but the game is not very interesting any more anyway.} Bxc2 {?} 15. Qxc6+ Rd7 16. Qxc2 {At this point my opponent resigned. This is a first success with the Vienna Game. It is clear that my win doesn't have anything to do with the opening - my opponent just blundered, but hey, this encourages me to try out the Vienna Game (or Vienna Gambit) more often in the future anyway!}
