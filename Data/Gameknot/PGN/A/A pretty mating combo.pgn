1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {My standard reply.} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Bd6 {I have had good success with this, although after this game I may have to consider switching to 6... Be7} 7. O-O O-O 8. c4 c6 9. cxd5 {I had not faced this before} cxd5 10. Nc3 Nxc3 {10... Re8 is also possible} 11. bxc3 Bg4 12. Rb1 Nd7 {With the idea that after Rxb7 Nb6 White will have trouble extricating his rook} 13. h3 Bh5 14. Rb5 Nb6 15. c4 Bxf3 {Of course, not 15... dxc4 16. Rxh5} 16. Qxf3 dxc4 17. Bc2 Qd7 18. a4 Rab8 {18... an immediate g6 is also possible to prevent White from moving his Rook or Queen to h5} 19. Bg5 Nc8 {Trying too hard to hold on to the b pawn! I did not see White's threat. After 19. Rfe8 20.Rfb1 Black is ok although White will eventually win back his pawn with a5} 20. Rfb1 {White could have tried an immediate Qh5, after which ...g6 falls to the same combo as in the game.} b6 21. Qh5 g6 {Still not seeing the danger. The ugly ... f5 was necessary.} 22. Bf6 {And White wins! The point is that if Black takes the Queen, Rg5 is mate. In the meantime, White has the dual threat of Qh6 and 23. Qxh7+ Kxh7 24. Rh5+ Kg8 25. Rh8#}
