1. e4 {My opponent resigned on move 26 with a scathing note accusing me of playing like a computer.  He put me on ignore, not allowing any discussion on the subject whatsoever.  What is fascinating to me, is how he came to this conclusion as to me it seems like a very straightforward game.  So here are my thoughts on the game.  } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 {There doesn't seem to be any mystery about what is going on.  I am playing against one of the most popular openings that black has (sicilian) and the most popular variation of that opening (najorf)  The gamedatabase alone at gameknot is full of this line } e6 7. f3 b5 8. g4 h6 9. Qd2 b4 10. Na4 Nbd7 11. Bd3 Ne5 {now i don't know if it is good to allow him to take my bishop, but I will get strong center pawns and an open c file.  } 12. O-O Nxd3 13. cxd3 Qa5 {i move the pawn to give a space for my knight to move and to protect my knight, also to block the pawn} 14. b3 Bd7 15. Nb2 Rb8 {i am not sure what he is thinkingwith this move} 16. Rfc1 {rooks on open file, no mystery here} Be7 17. Rc2 {doubling up rooks, these are key ingredients to my play, not just in the game but whenever i can} O-O 18. Rac1 Qd8 19. Rc2c7 {rook on the seventh rank, a good idea} a5 20. Ra7 {getting ready for the other rook to get on the seventh} Rc8 21. Nc4 {why exchange rooks?  No it is better to centralize the knight} Ra8 {nope, no exhange for me} 22. Rb7 Nh7 {now he is moving his knight back from the center?  } 23. Nb6 {a knight on the 6th rank I have been told can be as valuable as a rook.  } Bc8 {so I take the bishop with my knight.  To me, it is pretty easy to calculate that if he takes back he will lose his other dark squared bishop after my rook on c1 takes rook queen takes rook, then rook takes bishop on e7)} 24. Nxc8 {my oppponent has the same calculations as me and in fact doesn't even bother to take back the knight.  Instead moves his bishop.  } Bf6 {so i move my knight.  really not much time spent on this move.  } 25. Nb6 {Perhaps my opponent so angry because he is higher rated then me and expects that he should win on his higher rating alone.  } Ra6 {he attacks my knight...} 26. Rc8 {I attack his queen and he quits with the afore mentioned scathing note.  Now, I have played quite a few games on gameknot, my ratings graph alone will show that there is a very close match with the rating of the player vs the win or loss.  I had greatly enjoyed this game as I was losing quite a few games around then.  Saddened me that this player was such a poor sport.  I don't use computers to play my games, of course there is no way for me to prove it; but if you agree with me, can you let my opponent know?  His name is goffredob.  Thanks}
