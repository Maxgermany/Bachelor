1. d4 {A "casual" game that went to a nice final combination, even with many mistakes in the middle. } d5 2. Bf4 h6 {Sensible but poor answer. Not without a plan behind. } 3. Nf3 Nf6 {Logical was g5, following with the plan. Anyway, it is still possible. } 4. h3 {Returning the loss of tempo. This move, nevertheless, prepares g4...} e6 {Closing in his own lsb. Ok. Better for me. } 5. c3 {This formation has a name we recently learned, but I couldn't remind its name. } Be7 6. g4 {Black can answer g5, with a tense game based on h4 by White. } Nh7 {! Good. } 7. h4 {Blocking h4 for the Bdsb. } O-O {? Castling just under my firepower!} 8. Nbd2 {Giving black a last chance to play c5. } e5 {?! concedes a pawn in order to free his B. It's not that bad.} 9. Nxe5 Nd7 {After the N's Exchange, g4 will fall, but is this a disadvantage for me or for my opponent?} 10. Nxd7 Bxd7 11. e3 Bxh4 {Ah, h4, of course, became undefended in the process. But again, it can reverse to my benefit. } 12. Nf3 {? Mistake. } Bxg4 13. Bh3 {Desperate try. I'm not sure black anything sacrifying the B on f2+. } Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Ng5 {Well, I regret this, but it was the only way to keep active. } 15. Bxg5 Qxg5 16. O-O-O {Now, I am -1 and defending my weak pawn's chain. } Qf6 17. Qg4 {?! Offering f2 for a tempo to align R and Q. } Bg5 {f4 was called for, but blitz...} 18. Rh2 Qe7 {Now f4 is not possible anymore. } 19. Kd2 {The K has to help with the defence. } f5 {! Ouch! } 20. Qg2 {Threatening d5. } c6 {Defending. This will be tough. } 21. f4 {Last chance to play this. If Bh4, Bxf5, RxB, RxB leaves the black King unguarded. } Bf6 22. Bxf5 Bxd4 {! Delicate moment! } 23. Rxh6 {?? Getting into complications, but now Qxe3+ is deadly: Kc2, Qxc3+....} Rxf5 {?? My opponent misses it!} 24. cxd4 {Everything is ok now. } Re8 25. Rh3 {No point in leaving this R hanging. } Qb4+ {Ah, this was foreseen. } 26. Kc2 {! No prob. } Qc4+ 27. Kb1 {Well, a castled King, after all. } b5 {! My opponent won't leave me win in peace!:-)} 28. Rg3 Re7 {Nothing happened, and I can't allow Qd3+, Rxe3, so...} 29. Rc1 {?? I went for the countergame. } Qd3+ {Yes, now, which countergame am I talking about? Rxc6, Qd1+. } 30. Qc2 {More realistic, and preferring a drawish position than a lost one. I threat Rf5 (x-rays).} Qxc2+ 31. Rxc2 {Balance is even. I made mistakes, but I managed to came out of the danger without mayor losses. My opponent is really tough. } Rc7 32. Rc5 Rf6 {Better was Kf7, so my R had forbidden both places. } 33. Rg5 {This forces Rd6, since Rc7 is undefended. } Kf7 {?? This move costs black a wonderful game. } 34. Rgxd5 a6 {? Re5 was called for, even if not enough. } 35. Rde5 Re6 36. f5 Rxe5 37. dxe5 {!? I thought this was more restrictive for black. } Ke7 38. e4 Rc8 39. e6 {? Probably throwing away the advantage! Kc2 was to be considered. } Kd6 40. Rc2 c5 {Black achieved a free c5. } 41. Rg2 Rc7 42. Re2 {Threatening e5, forcing black to...} Ke5 43. Kc2 {Finally bringing the K into the fry. } c4 44. Kd2 {Until I can Exchange the pawns, I am secure. So I thought. } Kf6 {Now, if e5, Kxf5. But...} 45. Ke3 g5 {!? fxg6 scrambles my pawns and my advantage. } 46. a3 {? It seems good, stopping b4. The g pawn can't advance too much. But this move is a mistake, as now...} c3 {...threatens to retake with check, so a3 will fall!!!! Emergency plan ready: } 47. Kd3 {! Whew, I went out of this!} cxb2 48. Rxb2 Rc4 {Ok, accepting the good R position. } 49. Re2 {Still keeping e5 in mind. } a5 50. e5+ {Now or never. it seems bad, but a pawn in the 7th ranks whorths a lot. } Kxf5 51. e7 Rc8 {Now, it is a Little tactic problema to solve. If e6, Kf6, and nothing will stop Kxe7, blocking the other pawn. But...} 52. Rf2+ {!! Another pawn, that will cost black a R if taken! (Kxe5, Re2+, Kd6, e8=Q, RxQ, RxR...)} Ke6 53. Rf8 {! Black is now lost... } Kd7 {Forced, or the R is lost, and RxR gives W a Q. } 54. e6+ {!! The only move. This forces black to lose a R for the two pawns, after which black has no hopes. } Kxe7 55. Rxc8 Kxe6 56. Rc5 g4 57. Rxb5 Kf6 58. Rxa5 g3 59. Ke3 g2 60. Kf2 {And sensibly, black resigned. }
