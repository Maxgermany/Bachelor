1. e4 {When I first started this game I was weary.. although I had been on a healthy winning streak, I looked at my opponent, and so had he..} e5 {The standard opposition} 2. Bc4 {One of my favs, hate having bishops stuck behind pawns.. better in front} Nf6 {standard} 3. d3 {again wanted to give my bishop some breathing room, knights are more easily played later in the game as they can jump pawns} d5 {Offensive move, I could tell he really wanted the center of the board} 4. exd5 Nxd5 {As expected} 5. Qf3 {I now move my queen out for two reasons one is to get it out, he cant really attack the queen anytime soon as his knight is in the middle of the board and cant protect that crucial g4 tile for the bishop.  I also attack his knight and put a little but of pressure on the f7 pawn} Be6 {He covered both} 6. Nc3 {At this point he is in danger of losing his b7 pawn if he moves his knight, that is why I attacked hi knight on d5} Bb4 {He obviously did not like that} 7. Bd2 {Everytime an opponent does that bishop move I find it is a perfect opportunity to play your own bishop and get his out, sort of creates a stalemate on that piece now..} c6 {He realizes he need more support for that knight and also wants to protect the b7 pawn} 8. Nge2 {At this point I really wanted to get all of my pieces into the middle of the board.. it seems like it was gonna be a stalemate type of game in the middle, having more pieces is always good} O-O 9. O-O {We both castle} f5 {This was a big move for him, it showed me that he is attacking with everythign he is got, giving up that protection of his king.. in my opinion, with my white bishop where he was, this move was too dangerous and a mistake..} 10. a3 {I attacked bishop, because now my black bishop on d2 is not protected and hence my knight on c3 is pinned down.. I dont like that} b5 {Again.. showing me that he is very offensive, and he potentially realizes what threat the bishop of mine has, it is infact pinning down his knight.. I actually focused on exploiting that weakness for most of the game} 11. Bb3 {So I retreat, keeping the pressure on} Bxc3 {He takes me.. I have 2 options now..take with my bishop or take with my knight, if I take it with my bishop I put pressure on the e5 pawn, however as I thought about this, this would just give him reason and opportunity to get his other knight into play, so I did not want to do that} 12. Nxc3 {This way I also open up the e file and have 2 unused rooks that can attack it} a5 {He REALLY does not like my bishop over there.. and if you look at his pawn structure, he is really pushing forward trying to squeeze me... soon something was gonna explode} 13. Rfe1 {I realized that if he moves his a5 pawn up I can just retreat again, so there would be no harm, instead now I exploit that weak e6 pawn.  Normally he could of moved his knight to protect it, but that would mean he would blokc his queen from protecting the d5 knight and I had a lot of firepower aiming at that spot} Qd6 {So instead he moves his queen forward.  This was not a bad move, put his queen more into play, gave more room for his rooks, etc.  I was also starting to feel the pressure of the pawns and all of his pieces at this point...} 14. Nxd5 {So I decided to give myself some more breathing room, and more importantly I got a bishop pair, knowing that his pawn defence around his king was weak, I thought I might in the far future be able to exploit it} cxd5 {He could of also take it with the bishop, but I think he now like that his bishop was protecting a lot of pawns in the middle of the board.. quite powerful..  NOW... this is the move I thought about for 2 days (obviously off and on) and I decided to sacrifice my rook by taking the e5 pawn, the reasoning behind this was that I could then move my a1 rook which was doing jack squat and attack his queen} 15. Rxe5 {Once I did this the he took it} Qxe5 {I now move my rook} 16. Re1 {and now, although he could move back and protect his bishop again I could that take his bishop anyways with my rook and if he took my rook then I could take the d5 pawn with my bishop and trap his queen behind the king.. and he woudl lose the king.  Now.. my opponent saw this, and could of taken my rook (so in the end by the numbers it would have been an even trade.. however... I knew I had the bishop pair and a queen and with his king exposed like that, even if he did this.. I think I could pull of the win.. so in the end he decided to instead take my weak pawn on b2} Qxb2 {I took his bishop anyways, and now there is a lot of pressure on his king } 17. Rxe6 Ra6 {He now realizes something important.. and that is that that rook is actually my only lifeline... cause he can checkmate me in one move with his queen if my rook moves off of that file} 18. Qxd5 {I now took his pawn cause my queen could also be traded to protect my king} Kh8 {He moves his king out of the way.. relieving a LOT of pressure} 19. g3 {I also relieve the pressure on me.. now at this point if you look at the board, his queen is doing much much less than my queen and is kind of trapped in a sad little corner} Rxe6 20. Qxe6 {we trade pieces} Qxa3 {and now his is up 2 pawns.. looked kinda bleak.. BUT I still have my bishop pair, and you can see that there is a lot of potential pressure on his king.. and his knight, which hasnt moved all game is pinned by my queen} 21. Bf4 {Now, this was a very important move, at this point I know that his bishop cant move much cause If it take him, its mate, by moving my bishop here, I can attack the queen and rook at the same time next move, and also put some pressure on the knight (which isnt that important, but a good distraction nonethelss)} Qc5 {He realizes that he NEEDS to get his queen back into the action, other wise I could eventually move my queen to f7, forcing his rook to c8 and then I could play by bishop to e5 whcih would results in checkmate} 22. Bd6 {I now want my points back and want to kill his rook} Qc8 {his only move} 23. Bxf8 {I take} Qxf8 {he takes.. now if you look at the positioning.. his king is trapped his knight cant move.. I defintely have the upper hand} 24. Qb6 {I now want to get rid of those pawns so that mine can start to move up} a4 {he attacks my bishop.. now this was gonna be a tough move for me.. but I decided to move by bishop to e6, and start to push up my d file pawn up to d5, so that I would get a strong protected centre there} 25. Be6 {Now what I expected was he push his pawn up to b4, which I would have then responed with moving my pawn to d4, I would of then suspect he move his other pawn to a3, giving him a good run for  a queen and since both pawns would be on black tiles I couldnt use my bishop against them, I would have responed with moving my pawn to d5.  This would have played out to me winning in the end I think as I could keep pushing my pawn up.. however none of this happened} g6 {He made a mistake.. and now he dies} 26. Qd4+ {boom} Qg7 {boom} 27. Qd8+ {BOOM and he resigns}
