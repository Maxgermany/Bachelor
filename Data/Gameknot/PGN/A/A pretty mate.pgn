1. e4 {This is a team game.  I've recently had a dreadful record on Gameknot, and in team games in particular, but this game goes some way to restore my equilibrium.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 b5 {Archangelsk again} 5. Bb3 Nf6 6. O-O Nxe4 7. d4 {the game develops quickly and sharply} d6 {?! The white squares look vulnerable} 8. Bd5 {Forking the 2 Ns} Nxf2 {Making the best of a bad job, I suspect} 9. Bxc6+ {White wins a piece} Bd7 10. Bxd7+ {This may seem less profitable than taking the R on a8 but it gives check, so I also pick up the N on f2, without giving Black the chance to take my Q on d1 } Qxd7 11. Rxf2 {and another} exd4 12. Qxd4 f6 {Black defends g7} 13. Bf4 {White now proceeds to complete development as quickly as possible} Be7 14. Nc3 c6 {depriving White of the d5 square for his N} 15. Re1 O-O 16. Rfe2 {White's centralised pieces are ideal} Bd8 17. Qxd6 Bb6+ 18. Kh1 Qf5 {Black sensibly avoids the Q swap at this stage} 19. Nh4 Qh5 20. Qe6+ Kh8 21. Nf5 b4 22. Ne4 {Everything is now ready to aim at Black's K} Rae8 {unfortunately, this doesn't work} 23. Nxf6 Rxe6 24. Nxh5 Rxe2 25. Rxe2 g6 {25...Rxf5 26. Re8  Rf8 27. Rxf8   so Black had no choice.} 26.
