1. f4 {This is a strange opening. Perhaps white wants to move the pawn before he brings out his knight, but his king already feeling a breeze.} d5 {A logical pawn thrust to gain central control.} 2. d4 {If white wanted a queen pawn opening, he surely should have done this on his first move.} Bg4 {Pins the king pawn in an attempt to restrict developement.} 3. h3 {Now I must acknowledge that my last move was a mistake, because after 3. ... Bh5 4. g4 Bg6 5. f5 ... my bishop is trapped.} Bf5 {The only move other than a full retreat or the quiet Bd7.} 4. e3 Nf6 {I see the hole a e4, and get ready to occupy it if I wish.} 5. Bd3 Be4 6. Bxe4 Nxe4 {I have now occupied the outpost, but...} 7. Nd2 {white can easily challenge my knight.} e6 8. Nxe4 dxe4 9. Ne2 Bb4+ {This move is too aggressive, and accomplishes nothing.} 10. c3 Ba5 11. O-O {Now my bishop looks silly, with nothing to do.} Qh4 {Hoping for a kingside attack.} 12. a4 {This doesn't seem to do anything.} Nd7 {A terrible blunder, which costs me a piece.} 13. b4 {Now I see the purpose of a4, white was hoping to trap my bishop, which I unfortunately overlooked. Now I just have to decide how to lose the piece.} Bb6 14. a5 a6 15. axb6 Nxb6 {It seems like the best way to let the bishop go.} 16. Qc2 {Attacks the pawn.} f5 {Defending.} 17. Qb3 {Over the next few moves, white gains a dangerous attack.} Kf7 18. Kh2 g5 {A very bad move, only helping white. I wanted to open lines for my own rook.} 19. fxg5 Qxg5 20. Ng3 Nd5 {Trying to block the queen.} 21. Nxf5 {Now taking back would be devastating, I feel my position falling apart.} Nf6 {blocking all the discovered checks.} 22. Ng3 Rhg8 {One final effort to make something happen.} 23. Rxf6+ {If I take with the king, he has Ne4+} Qxf6 {So I must take with the queen.} 24. Nxe4 {A blunder, can you find the winning combination?} Rxg2+ {Suddenly I can turn the tables.} 25. Kxg2 Rg8+ 26. Ng3 Qg6 27. Kf1 Qxg3 28. Ke2 Qg2+ 29. Kd3 Qf1+ 30. Kc2 Rg2+ 31. Bd2 {White has played perfectly since his mistake, most or all other lines would have ended with checkmate. For example, 31. Kb1 Qd3+ 32. Qc2 Qxc2#} Qxa1 {I'm finally winning.} 32. Kd3 {White steps into force mate. He would have had chances if not for this.} Qf1+ 33. Ke4 {Kc2 would have held out longer. But this move allows mate in one.} Qf5# {Checkmate. I was able to save a losing game with a great combination.}
