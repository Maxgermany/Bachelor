1. e4 {Hi everyone!  In Master Freddy's annotation tournament I now have 4 points out of 7 games and have chalked up my third win.  I take the black side of this Sicilian Grand Prix Mini Tournament.  I get into my usual bind in the middle game but somehow get out of it into a won endgame.  Anyhow.  Let's start the action on move 8 where I play Kc6.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 {8. ....... Kc6 - this move is better than Kc7 so Master Freddy says, therefore I play it.} 9. Bxg4 e6 {9. ....... e6 - here I decide on e6 and see how that pans out.} 10. Nc3 Na6 {10. ...... Na6 - development and heading for b4.} 11. g3 Nb4 12. O-O Nxc2 {12. ....... Nxc2 - Bob prevents the fork by castling kingside but I decide to whip off the c2 pawn anyway, especially as my e4 pawn is about to drop.} 13. Rb1 Qd4+ {13. ....... Qd4+ - I thought long and hard over this move, still Glenda has been far too passive for my liking, let her at least get a taste of aggro I say!} 14. Kh1 Re8 {14. ..... Re8 - centralises rook and adds protection to my e6 pawn.} 15. Be2 a6 16. Ngxe4 {16. Ngxe4 - the e4 pawn predictably drops.} Nb4 17. Bf3 Kc7 {17. ..... Kc7 - Henry steps out of the concealed line of Bob's lsb on f3.} 18. b3 Kb8 {18. ...... Kb8 - you could say I have castled by hand here.} 19. Bb2 Qd7 20. Na4 Nd3 21. Bc3 {21. Bc3 - avoiding a B for N trade.} b5 22. Nb6 {22. Nb6 - this looks nasty but somehow I wriggle out of the mess.} Qd8 23. Ba5 Nb4 {23. ..... Nb4 - took 3 days before I took the plunge with this move.  A series of trades will follow after Bob teases the knight with a3.} 24. a3 Nc6 25. b4 cxb4 26. axb4 {26. axb4 - first a pawn trade.} Bxb4 27. Bxb4 Nxb4 {27. ....... Nxb4 - now a bishop trade.} 28. Rxb4 Qxb6 {28. ...... Qxb6 - now a knight trade.} 29. Ng5 Re7 {29. ......... Re7 - a prophylactic move here, defends the vulnerable e6 pawn and also prevents that horsie from coming in to f7.  Next move I play my pawn to h6 to kick Bob's knight away.} 30. d4 h6 31. Ne4 Rc8 {31. ..... Rc8 - my king rook moves for the first time in the game.} 32. Nc5 Rxc5 33. dxc5 Qxc5 {33. ....... Qxc5 - I decide to get rid of that white horsie at a cost of my rook, though I do get a pawn thrown in to the bargain too!} 34. Re4 {34. Re4 - hmm, I think Bob is gonna pile up on that e6 pawn, what shall I do?  I know, in the endgame I will follow the maxim, passed pawns must be pushed!!   So b4 it is.} b4 35. Rb1 a5 {35. ...... a5 - I decide to give my b passer some reinforcement.} 36. Rbe1 Qb6 {36. ....... Qb6 - Glenda does some more valuable defensive duties here, but they are very valuable indeed!  One of those pawns may well become her clone!} 37. Bg4 b3 {37. ....... b3 - I ignore the attack on my e6 pawn, it will fall next move but never mind, my b pawn is only 2 squares away from Glendadom!} 38. Re4xe6 Rxe6 39. Rxe6 Qb7+ {39. .......... Qb7+ - after the e6 pawn has duly disappeared, Glenda steals a tempo-gaining check on b7.} 40. Kg1 b2 41. Re8+ {41. Re8+ - a spite check but Henry cooly moves to a7.  At least white has no dsb!} Ka7 42. Bf5 b1=Q+ {42. ........ b1/Q+ - Glenda 2 appears for just one moment, but Bob's lsb must give up his life for Glenda's clone.  It's Q against R + P now folks!} 43. Bxb1 Qxb1+ 44. Kf2 a4 {44. ...... a4 - I now decide to push my a pawn towards Glendadom.} 45. Re5 Qb2+ 46. Re2 {46. Re2 - Bob blocks Glenda's check with his rook but Glenda has a little spell up her sleeve here.} Qxe2+ 47. Kxe2 {47. Kxe2 - Glenda disappears for now, but wait, a few moves down the line ........} a3 48. Kd2 a2 49. Kc2 a1=Q {49. ........ a1/Q - ......... but in a puff of smoke she reappears on a1!} 50. Kd3 {50. Kd3 - Bob decides to play on so I must do some clean up work here then proceed to force mate.} Qb2 51. Ke4 Qxh2 {51. ........ Qxh2 - stage 1 - one of the kingside pawns drops.} 52. g4 Qh4 {52. ...... Qh4! - Bob cannot avoid losing his remaining pawns, you will see how in a minute!} 53. Kf5 g6+ {53. ........ g6+! - a decoy!} 54. Kxg6 Qxg4+ {54. ........ Qxg4+ - fork.} 55. Kxh6 Qxf4+ {55. ...... Qxf4+ - well, there is no way I can lose this and now Bob waves the white flag.  True he can bring his king to the g column, but Henry will wend his way to the f column forcing the WK to the edge.  Glenda will then move to the g column as far away as possible from the WK to avoid stalemate.  Henry will then move opposite the WK with 1 square separating the kings.  After that, there is no way Bob can prevent Glenda from giving his king the Kiss of Death!  Whew, what a game!}
