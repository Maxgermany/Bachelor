1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  This is the game that I promised to show you which starts off as another Reti Opening.  In the middlegame one player sees the opportunity to attack, firstly by a pawn storm, then sacrificing a piece for two pawns and then a queen joins in the fun, but which queen, is it the black queen or is it Glenda?  To find out you will just have to read on.  Here is the GA analysis. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=27160383&rnd=0.5152885048607565} Nc6 2. d4 g6 3. e4 b6 4. Be3 Bb7 5. c4 {5. c4 - over the past few moves I have been establishing a strong pawn centre.  If I had a pawn on f4 this would transpose into the Pirc Defense/Austrian Attack.} a6 6. Nc3 e6 7. a3 {7. a3 - discouraging either Bb4 or Nb4.} Nf6 8. h3 {8. h3 - I now prevent Ng4.} Bg7 9. Qd2 {9. Qd2 - should the BK go kingside then I will exchange Fou Lenoir for black's dark square bishop leaving black vulnerable on the black squares and Glenda taking full advantage of this.} Qe7 10. Bd3 {10. Bd3 - for now though I continue to develop and watch where black puts his king.} h6 11. b4 {11. b4 - goodness gracious, great wall of pawns!} Na7 12. Qe2 d6 13. O-O {13. 0-0 - I finally choose the kingside and black chooses the queenside.  Suddenly I unleash a pawn storm.} O-O-O 14. c5 b5 15. a4 {15. a4 - like this!} c6 16. cxd6 Qd7 {16. ..... Qd7 - first blood to Yours Truly.  If the BQ should recapture on d6 then the BQ and the knight on f6 will be caught in a pawn fork.  As a result I go a pawn up and a passer at that!} 17. e5 {17. e5 - and I now back it up and put the question to the knight on f6.} Nd5 18. Nxd5 exd5 19. axb5 cxb5 20. Rfc1+ {20. Rfc1+ - after a knight trade and a pawn trade the c file has been opened.  I seize on this immediately and use my king rook as I feel that the other rook will be needed to rake down the a column.} Nc6 {20. ..... Nc6 - black defends by interposition but now, here comes ........ wait for it .........} 21. Bxb5 {21. Bxb5 ...... wait for it .......} axb5 22. Qxb5 {22. Qxb5 - NOW!! - that was the bishop sac!  The BK has been denuded of pawn cover and just look at whose come to boogie!  GLENDA!!} Kb8 {22. .... Kb8 - pinbreaker and here comes a deathly quiet move just one square from Glenda - to b6.  Black's light square bishop is now horribly pinned.} 23. Qb6 f6 24. b5 {24. b5 - attacking the knight.  This knight is doomed because if it moves then Qa7+ is mate due to the fact that the c file will be open to my rook on c1.} Rdc8 {24. ....Rc8 - stops the mate but black will now lose heavy material.} 25. bxc6 Rxc6 26. Rxc6 Qxc6 27. Qa7+ Kc8 28. Rc1 {28. Rc1 - the BQ is pinned and lost.} fxe5 29. Rxc6+ Bxc6 {29. ..... Bxc6 - trying to get as much material back for his queen as possible.  However, after gatecrashing black's party and doing a lot of boogie boogie in black's position, Glenda is feeling HOT, HOT, HOT!} 30. Qc7# {30. Qc7 MATE!! - Yup, the BK now feels the deadly white heat of Glenda and is given The Kiss of Death (this is what this type of support mate is sometimes known as). This is Glenda's dream role, to be delivering checkmate at close range (I can think of nothing more empowering than that) and not defending pawns, vital though that role is, and getting bogged down by passivitis into the bargain.  Sadly, Glenda will never now be able to do that to Freddy the Master Mater (Easy 19) as he has now quit gameknot to pursue a walking career.  Still, there are lots of other big fish in Gameknot's sea that Glenda may prevail against and I must hold on to that belief as I continue my career of being Club Founder of Walking the Walk and Learning to Run.  In every game, no matter how passive I may get, I will always be on the lookout for ways to go for the jugular and nail my opponent's king.  Kind regards - Joanne}
