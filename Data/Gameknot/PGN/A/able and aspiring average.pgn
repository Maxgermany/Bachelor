[Opening "Sicilian defence (B30)"]

1. e4 {Freeing the queen and dark-squared bishop.} c5 {1 ... c5 Currently the most popular response to 1 e4 - known as the sicilian defence. Immediately stakes a claim in the centre by attacking d4.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {Preparing for d4.} d5 4. Bd3 e6 5. O-O {Castling the King into safety before proceeding with queenside development.} Nf6 {The pressure on the e4 pawn mounts.} 6. e5 Nd7 7. Bb5 a6 8. Bxc6 bxc6 9. d4 cxd4 {At this stage Black already has the upper-hand with a far superior pawn chain and a strong foothold in the centre. White's loss of control in the centre will limit the activity of the pieces in the later stages of middle-game.} 10. cxd4 c5 11. b3 cxd4 {Leaves the e-file pawn unprotected.} 12. Nxd4 Nxe5 {And white has no pawns in the centre; on reflection this is, probably, the end of the start of white's downfall. } 13. Be3 Bd6 14. Nc3 O-O 15. Nce2 Ng4 {Attacking the h3 pawn.} 16. Bf4 {By attempting to protect the h-file pawn I neglected to see the fork 16 ... e5. A fatal error which leaves me a minor piece down. g3 would have been a far better move, or  Ng3.} e5 {Forking the bishop and knight.} 17. Nc6 Qc7 18. Nxe5 Bxe5 19. Bxe5 Qxe5 {A pawn for a minor piece leaves white down in material and black is threatening      20 ... Qxh2 mate.                   } 20. Ng3 h5 21. Re1 Qd6 22. Qd4 h4 {Attempting to force the knight away for 23 ... Qxh2 } 23. Nf1 h3 24. g3 Bf5 25. Rac1 Be4 {Leaves the knight on g4 hanging.} 26. Nd2 Bg2 27. Qxg4 {Material is even again, though black has a distinct positional advantage with the queen, bishop and h-pawn in threatening positions whilst the black king remains in safety.} Rfe8 28. Nf3 Re7 29. Nh4 Rae8 {Doubles the rook on the e-file. White will have to be extremely careful to survive.} 30. Re3 Re7xe3 31. fxe3 Qb6 {Pins the pawn on e3. The white king already looking trapped by the bishop and queen.} 32. Nf5 {Threatening 33 Qxg7 mate.} g6 33. Nd4 {A mistake; the pawn is unpinned but is undefended against the black rook.} Rxe3 {Both material and position in blacks favour now.} 34. Rc8+ {I now launch a counter-attack on black's king in the hopes of relieving some pressure on my own king by distracting some of black's attacking pieces with defensive duties.} Kg7 35. Nf5+ Kf6 36. Qd4+ {Offering to exchange queens, which in light of the positional advantage black has was a mistake. I should have maintained an attacking position without exchanging any pieces.} Qxd4 37. Nxd4 Re1+ {Immediately white is back on the back-foot. Black is drawing in for the kill.} 38. Kf2 Rh1 {Attempting to free the h3 pawn.} 39. Ne2 Rxh2 40. Ng1 {Attacks the h3 pawn in hopes of exchanging, or driving away, the menacingly placed white-sqaured bishop.} Be4+ 41. Kf1 {Loses a knight for a pawn. The game is almost over for white at this stage.} Rh1 {Pins the knight.} 42. Kf2 h2 43. Rc1 hxg1=Q+ 44. Rxg1 Rxg1 45. Kxg1 {Wins a knight for a pawn leaving black ahead a bishop and a pawn ahead.} Bb1 46. a3 a5 47. Kf2 Ke5 48. Ke2 Ke4 49. b4 axb4 50. axb4 d4 51. Kd2 Bd3 52. g4 f6 53. Ke1 Ke3 54. Kd1 Bb5 55.
