[Opening "Sicilian (B28), O'Kelly variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 a6 {I'm assuming this is to restrict the Bishop, but it seems a wasted move at this stage.} 3. Bc4 e6 {Black is falling behind in development at an alarming pace.} 4. d3 d5 {Gaining back a tempo by attacking the B. Whether White exchanges Pawns first or not, the B must retreat.} 5. exd5 {White does opt for the exchange, opening the King file and potentially subjecting both Kings to a quick attack. Now it could be whoever either reaches safety first or forces their attack home "fustest with the mostest."} exd5 6. Bb3 {This Bishop is now rather out of play. White's advantage in time has been cut into and Black has the stronger center.} Nf6 7. Bg5 {The pin is tempting, but this move is badly timed. White should take the opportunity to castle here.} Be7 8. Nbd2 O-O {In an ironic twist, despite White's initial gain of time it is *Black* whose King reaches safety. White never does get his King out of the danger zone!} 9. h4 {Missing yet another chance to reach a safe haven. White has forgotten the basic principle of never embarking on complications without castling.} Re8 {With a looming threat.} 10. Nf1 {This move gets a "???" for sure. Black now has a simple tactical finesse that either wins quickly or slowly.} c4 {Threatens PxB, which White sees... and something else, which White doesn't see.} 11. dxc4 {11 N(1)-Q2 loses slowly, as after 11...PxB 12 NxP Black has a winning material advantage. The move actually played...} Bb4# {...loses at once.}
