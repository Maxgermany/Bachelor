1. d4 {Hi everyone, when playing an unrated game against my buddy rjacobs (he has an optimum rating of 1688) I decided to try out the Albin.  The match was to end in a drawn K & P endgame - you the jury decide how successful this choice was.} d5 2. c4 e5 {2. .......... e5 - the Albin Counter-Gambit - can lead to interesting play.} 3. dxe5 d4 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. e4 dxe3 e.p. 6. Qxd8+ Nxd8 7. Bxe3 Bb4+ {7. ................ after a plethora of exchanges including an early queen trade I now try to get my pieces out and get some play for my pawn minus.} 8. Nbd2 Bg4 9. Be2 Nc6 10. O-O Bxd2 11. Bxd2 h6 {11. ........... h6 - to prevent a knight incursion on g5.} 12. Bc3 Be6 {12. .......... Be6 - to blockade the e5 pawn uncovering an attack from white's dsb onto my g pawn.} 13. Rad1 Nge7 14. Rfe1 O-O {14. ........ 0-0 - finally I have completed my development.  Although white controls the d file white cannot invade on the 7th rank because it is covered by Frere Leblanc.  On my next move, however, I decide to challenge the d file.} 15. h3 Rfd8 16. b4 Rxd1 17. Rxd1 Rd8 18. b5 Rxd1+ 19. Bxd1 Nb8 {19. .............. Nb8 - the knight is forced to retreat to its home square but it emerges onto d7 and this will eventually lead to me obtaining material equality.} 20. Bb3 Nd7 21. Nd4 Ng6 22. Nxe6 fxe6 23. a4 Ngxe5 24. Bxe5 Nxe5 {24. .......... Nxe5 - material equality is restored.  Mission accomplished.  White has a slight edge here due to me having an isolani and white's pawns being more advanced.  However, things can change.} 25. c5 Kf7 26. Kf1 Ke7 27. Ke2 b6 {27. .......... b6 - challenging white's imposing pawn roll on the queenside and preventing the standard pawn breakthrough which could occur should white play a5.  The queenside pawn structure will soon be locked - this is a good thing to me as the white king will not be able to get through - Henry can therefore handle what is to come on the kingside.} 28. c6 Kd6 29. Ke3 Nf7 30. f4 Nd8 31. Kd4 Ke7 32. g4 Nf7 33. h4 Nd8 34. Ke5 Nf7+ 35. Kd4 Nd8 36. f5 {36. f5?! - after spending the last few moves aimlessly moving Henry and my knight around white pushes his f pawn - not too sure this is a good plan as I get rid of my isolani and leave white with two!} exf5 37. gxf5 Kf6 38. Ke4 Nf7 39. Bxf7 Kxf7 {39. ......... Kxf7 - now down to a K & P ending.} 40. Ke5 Ke7 41. h5 Kf7 42. Kf4 Ke7 {42. .......... Ke7.  After this move we agreed a draw.  I think white's next move would be Ke6 holding back my king.  Interesting game.}
