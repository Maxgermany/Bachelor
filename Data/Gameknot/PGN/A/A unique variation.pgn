1. e4 {The usual...} f5 {... and the deviation. No P-K4 for T.M. today!} 2. exf5 {Natural...} b6 {I guess he's planning a fianchetto... my KP HAS been diverted, so...} 3. f4 {I'm going to try and take some central control myself...} g5 {T. M. counters with a flank assault...} 4. Qh5+ {I was going to capture the KNP en passant, when I looked again and found this!
