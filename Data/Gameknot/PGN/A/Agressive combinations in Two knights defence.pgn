1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {That's the key possition. Here white usually play 4. Ng5 followed by 4... Bc5 or 4...d5. That's why people more often play 3... Bc5 rather than 3... Nf6. So I rarely get a chance to play my favourite variation and that's not an oportunity to miss. } 4. d4 {Early center attack. } exd4 5. O-O {The line that I tried to follow here was 5... Nxe4 6. Re1 d5 7.Bxd5 Qxd5 8. Nc3! with better center for white, but equal game. My opponent decided to evade that. } Bc5 6. e5 {Needed, cause after a while I won't have a chance to place my pawn there. In such positionsq computers usually propose moves like 6... Ng4. In my opinion it leads to nothing extraordinary. My rook anyway would go to e1. But people decide to play else. } d5 {Few times I've played that with black and the center happens to be a good advantage. A short research in megadatabase showed that a precise game might lead to some interesting continuations. } 7. exf6 dxc4 8. fxg7 Rg8 9. Bg5 {A key move. Develops a piece with tempo and more... } Be7 {9... Qd5 10. Nc3 and also the f6 square is left unsafe.  9... Qd6 10. Nbd2 and I attack on c4 and more dangerous Ne4  In that position black had moved their bishop back and that weakens the d4 pawn. } 10. Bxe7 {Other continuation was Re1. I chosed that cause it certainly leads to losing d4 pawn or the chance to castle. } Kxe7 {Decided to let the castle go. } 11. Re1+ Be6 {Expected. That's the next key position, cause of the many possible plans here. There are moves such as Ng5, Nbd2, Na3, Qe2, Re4. I decided to try one of the rarest plans. } 12. b4 {Treats b5 and returning the pawn on d4. 12... a6 might just do the work, but my opponent decided not to lose a tempo. } cxb3 e.p. 13. axb3 Rxg7 {I thought of that and I liked the position cause I can join my other rook in the game. } 14. Ra4 {Interesting to note is the following 14... b5 15. Nxd4 axb 16. Nxc6+ } Qg8 {That might be the move  that decides the game. It places blacks queen in very inactive position. } 15. g3 {And the attack here is kinda dull. } Kf8 {What I guess my oponent thought of is that now after 16. Nxd4 he can play Rd8 and there is no Nxc6 with check. But Kf8 blaces the g8 queen in even more closed position. } 16. Na3 {I decided to end my development, keep my rook from the b5 treat and direct myself to many targets a7, c7 and d4. } h5 {Consistent in his plans. } 17. Nb5 Bg4 {At first, that seemed to be a problem. Then I thought of a way to avade all exchanges and gain a big advantage. } 18. Qc1 {If 18... Bxf3 19. Qa3 Ne7 20. Qxe7# } Qh7 {Tries to make his queen more active. } 19. Nxc7 Rc8 {After 19... Rd8 there is Nxd4 again, 20... Nxd4 21. Rxd4! } 20. Nxd4 h4 21. Qa3+ Kg8 22. Ne8 {That move leads to material advantage at last. Now I attack the rook on g7 and treat to play Nf6+ at the same time. } Rg6 {Only possible defence. } 23. Nxc6 {Black could not take 23... Rgxc6 cause then I take the bishop on g4. } Rcxc6 {If 23... bxc 24. Rxg4 but here I have even better move. } 24. Nf6+ {Black lose their queen cause otherwise there is Re8+ and Qf8# }
