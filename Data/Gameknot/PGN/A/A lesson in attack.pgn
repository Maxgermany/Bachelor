[Opening "Sicilian (B31), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (with ...g6, without ...d6)"]

1. e4 {White is a little known player from Azerbaijan, he seems very fond of the line in the game. I have no idea who Black is, couldn't find this particular game on two game databases I looked, originally I saw it in an older book of mine. Perhaps it was removed from newer databases because the line in question is no longer relevant.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Rossolimo variation. White doesn't want to enter the Sveshnikov and as such, postpones playing d4 for the time being.} g6 {The most enterprising move for Black but at the same time riskier than the main alternatives, 3...e6 and 3...d6.} 4. c3 {A main idea behind 3. Bb5, just like the Ruy Lopez, White wants to establish a strong pawn center.} Bg7 {A slow reaction, better is 4...Nf6, unhinging the White central pawns.} 5. d4 cxd4 {Another inaccuracy, better is 5...Qb6 at once.} 6. cxd4 Qb6 {A double attack on d4 and b5, but material gain with Black so early on cannot be undertaken without great risks.} 7. Nc3 {The reason why the pawn exchange was a mistake. Now both White's Knights are perfectly developed.} Nxd4 8. Nd5 {The Bishop is immune due to the fork on c7.} Nxf3+ 9. Qxf3 Qd6 10. Bd2 {Preparing to chase the Queen around some more.} e6 {The Knight is too advanced to be tolerated anymore.} 11. Bb4 Qb8 12. O-O {Not budging an inch.} a6 {The Knight is to big to swallow. After 12...exd5 13. exd5 f6 (forced, to make room for the King) 14. Rfe1+ Kf7 15. d6 Bf8 (again forced, or else Black gets mated) 16. Rac1 and Black is caged in the back two rows of the board. Black just wants to push the intruding White pieces back.} 13. Rac1 {And White completely ignores the fact that two of his pieces are en-prise and just carries on developing.} exd5 {Black blinks first and snatches up material. All of this at the expense of more time. The truth is that the White pieces were putting too much pressure on Black's position and preventing the Black army from joining the battle.} 14. exd5 axb5 {Taking the second piece is just too much. A more cautious approach was to continue development.} 15. Rfe1+ Be5 {Forced. If 15...Kd8 then 16. Qxf7 mates in a few moves while 15...Qe5 obviously loses the Queen without stopping the attack.} 16. d6 {Not the best move, but very instructive. More to the point was 16. Rxc8 Qxc8 17. Rxe5+ Kd8 18. Qe3 and White just wins more than enough material to easily secure the full point.} Kf8 17. Rxe5 b6 18. Rc7 {Again more concrete was 18. Rce1.} Rxa2 {Threatens mate in one.} 19. h3 Qa8 {Black wants to exchange White's main weapon in the attack, the Queen.} 20. Qe3 Bb7 {Black is trying to develop some counter-pressure but does nothing about the safety of his King.} 21. Rxb7 {A brilliant sacrifice that needed either very thorough calculation or just sheer bravery. Sometimes, intuition is the best tool in an attack.} Qxb7 {After this, White has a forced mate.} 22. Re8+ Kg7 23. Bc3+ f6 24. Rxg8+ Rxg8 25. Bxf6+ Kxf6 26. Qe7+ Kf5 27. g4+ {And despite the huge material deficit, Black resigned because after 27...Kf4 28. Qe3 is mate. Summing up, I'd say this was one of the most direct and brave attacking games I've seen. I hope it will inspire you to create masterpieces like this one.}
