[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange, Alekhine variation"]

1. e4 {Hi everyone.  This game is one of my favorites so far on GK.  Whenever I have my choice as white, I play for the Ruy Lopez exchange variation.  One of my favorite things as black is when white plays it!!  When playing as black, the best way to avoid the inevitable losing endgame is to attack.  This game demonstrates that.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5 {This is inferior to the standard O-O.} Qd4 6. Ng4 Qxe4+ {Standard tactic to get the pawn back} 7. Ne3 Be6 {Black's intent in the lopez exchange is to castle Queenside and launch a pawn storm on the Kingside.} 8. O-O O-O-O 9. d3 Qg6 {The Queen comes to the Kingside for future use} 10. Nc3 Bd6 {notice both bishops aiming toward the K-side} 11. g3 h5 {After White plays g3, the standard way of disrupting the pawns is by pushing the Rook pawn} 12. b3 h4 13. g4 {this pawn is far too extended} f5 {using the pin on the G file} 14. f3 Nf6 {the knight that broke the camel's back (or something like that)} 15. Kh1 fxg4 16. Rg1 {This move looks intimidating, but I found a few tactics to make it harmless} g3 17. Ne4 Nxe4 18. dxe4 Be5 {discovery, attacking both Q and R} 19. Bd2 Bxa1 {Q cannot take because of 20...Rxd2} 20. Qe2 Bd4 {using the B to pin the N to the R on g2} 21. a4 Qf6 {I'm not quite sure the reasoning behind this move.  I think I wanted to be able to push the pawn on g2.  also, I wanted to alleviate the pin on me queen} 22. h3 Rhf8 {After white closes the h file, I turn my attention to the weak pawn on f3} 23. Rf1 {?? this gives me the opening I need.  The one piece that hasn't contributed so far suddenly comes to life} Bxh3 24. Ng4 {Here I had a choice.  I could have played 24...Bxf1 25.Nxf6 Bxe2.  I decided to keep things a little more interesting...} g2+ {and White resigns}
