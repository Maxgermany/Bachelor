1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is my situation.  I normally have less than 20 games on my active games list but after I came back from my Cornish holiday I found I had 27.  How did that happen?  Well, firstly, I took part in another mini-tournament which involved some buddies who I had not played with for quite a while, so I thought, why not?  Then my team captain gave me some team games, well it is about time I played some for my team as I had not played team games for quite a while.  Then a couple of people reinstated their timed out games and I thought it was unsportsmanlike to refuse.  So it all added up - and found myself with 15-20 new games.  I found myself relying on the database more than ever, so much so that it was a complete blur of black and white bars and facts and figures.  Sadly I became more focussed on that than on the actual position and so I felt on auto-pilot.  I chose a bad option and paid dearly for it.  Anyhow, on with the game.  This opening starts off as a double king pawn opening and turns into the Ruy Lopez.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {3. Bb5 - This move is the Ruy Lopez/Spanish Torture.} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 {4. ...... Nf6 - the most popular response to Bb5.} 5. O-O Be7 {5. ..... 0-0 - This starts off the Closed Ruy Lopez.  Funnily enough in another game against an Expert I decided to try the Open Lopez which is Nxe4.  That game is in progress so I may annotate that one at its conclusion, but here I choose the conservative Be7.} 6. Re1 {6. Re1 - prevents Nxe4 for good.} b5 7. Bb3 Na5 {7. ...... Na5?? - Dave gave this move 2 question marks in his post match pm to me.  This move was played in the World DB and had a black bar against it.  It should have a skull and cross bones painted on it!  Still, I suppose it has some merit.  It busts up white's queenside pawn structure slightly and black has the bishop pair.  But is this sufficient compo for the pawn minus?} 8. Nxe5 Nxb3 9. axb3 Bb7 10. d3 d5 {10. ...... d5 - now following the Gameknot DB.  This move is the best of the bad rubbish according to the bars.} 11. exd5 Qxd5 {11. ...... Qxd5 - threatens mate on g2 but this is easily parried.} 12. Nf3 Kf8 {12. ..... Kf8 - I didn't feel too comfortable with this king move but the expert who played it managed to draw the game.} 13. Bf4 Qd7 14. Nc3 {14. Nc3 - Dave deviates from the database at this move playing Nc3 instead of Nd2.  This throws me off the beaten track and into open play.} Bb4 {14. ...... Bb4 - a pin, but not a very effective one as you will see.} 15. d4 Nd5 16. Nxd5 {16. Nxd5 - I did not expect him to take the knight in response to the pin/pile up but he does.} Bxe1 {16. ....... Bxe1?? - should have cut my losses with B or Qxd5 retaining the bishop pair.  Now that horsie is gonna give me knightmares.} 17. Nxc7 {17. Nxc7 - a worthy intermezzo.} Bxf2+ {17. ........ Bxf2+ - Fou Lenoir tries to sell his life as dearly as possible.  This is called a desperado and boy that matches my mood perfectly here!} 18. Kxf2 Ra7 19. d5 {19. d5 - that d pawn is gonna be a major menace soon.} Bc8 20. d6 {20. d6 - Veni, Vidi, Vici says that humble foot soldier, and poor Glenda is reduced to blocking him!} Qf5 21. Qd4 {21. Qd4 - defending his bishop and menacing my a7 rook.  Glenda now gives Dave a spite check.} Qxc2+ 22. Kg1 Rb7 23. d7 {23. d7 - after my rook took evasive action this little pawn move sealed mine and poor Fou Leblanc's doom so I waved the white flag.  The fact that I drew against Dave just a few days back makes this performance look even more pathetic than it was.}
