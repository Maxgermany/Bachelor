[Opening "Gruenfeld (D86), exchange, classical variation"]

1. d4 {Hi all! I think this is an interesting game. White (me!) ends up with a far favourable endgame, with a pair of connected passed pawns on the sixth rank. However, disaster strikes, and a badly planned sacrifice leaves me with a two-pawn deficit and a lost endgame. But then, a clever resource by, yes, me again leads to a drawn endgame position. And so...as usual, I open with my queen pawn.} Nf6 {Black points the way to main line Queen Pawn "Indian" Openings with the flexible move 1...Nf6.} 2. c4 {White continues in the normal way, occupying the centre and controlling the d5-square.} g6 {Preparing to fianchetto the bishop.} 3. Nc3 d5 {Stamping this opening as a Gruenfeld Defence. Black offers White the chance to grab a big pawn centre in the sharp Exchange Variation4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3, but then puts heavy pressure on this centre. If White can hold on to this powerful centre, however, he can expect to hold a middlegame advantage. It is also possible to bypass this sharp line with 4.Nf3, the Three Knights Variation, or 4.Bf4, but, being myself, I decide to go for the sharp lines with all guns blazing!} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 {White's centre is now a thing of great beauty, but, watch out! Black will pile on as much pressure as he can! However, I must say that I am optimistic. In preparation for a team match, in which I knew that I was going to meet my arch-rival A.B. (no, not jelly939, my OTHER arch-rival!). A.B.'s favourite opening for Black against the queen pawn is the Gruenfeld, so I carried out extensive research on the Gruenfeld Exchange Variation in order to beat him, as it were, at his own game! I was relying on A.B.'s laziness in researching openings to give me a win in that game. Thankfully, laziness did its part, and I won in about 16 moves. So, the long and short of that long story is, that now I am happy about playing the sharp Gruenfeld Exchange Variation as White.} Bg7 {Starting to pile on the pressure.} 7. Bc4 {The logic behind this move, which apparently does nothing to shore up White's centre? It is really quite simple. White's centre, in particular the d-pawn, is going to need as much protection as possible. Putting White's knight on f3 is not going to work: it can then be pinned, and its defence negated. So, it must go to e2. And, therefore, the light-squared bishop must be developed first, in order to not be blocked in by the knight on e2. 7.Bc4 is the main line way of doing this.} c5 {Now the pressure gets serious. 7...c5 is an important move in challenging White's centre.} 8. Ne2 Nc6 9. Be3 O-O {For now, there is nothing Black can do against White's strong centre, so both sides go in for some developing moves.} 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 {An attempt to weaken the d-pawn's defence is thwarted - now you see the importance of Ne2 rather than Nf3! - and the silly bishop is chased away again.} cxd4 12. cxd4 Bd7 {Well, OK, after a brief interlude of pawn exchanges.} 13. Rc1 {Rook onto the open c-file, an important positional asset.} Nb4 14. a3 b5 15. Bb3 {Now, this is unexpected. Black has suddenly lost interest in the centre, and is visibly playing for a queenside expansion. Clearly, this needs to be stymied as quickly as possible.} Nc6 16. d5 {Attacked on the wing? Counterattack in the centre. This is followed religiously by defenders and feared by attacking players. The drawback in this case is that it gives Black's dark-squared bishop a brilliant diagonal to power down!!! Straight from h8 to a1!!!} Na5 17. Ba2 Rc8 {Challenging my open file. How irritating. Black's queenside expansion is really beginning to worry me now. Oh, yes, and, before I forget, the drawback to this move...} 18. Bxa7 {...is that White gets a free pawn. This puts pressure on Black's attack to work, otherwise he will be left with a material deficit.} Bb2 {OK, Black is eliminating the material deficit more quickly than I expected. This, unfortunately, will leave him with a passed b-pawn. Never mind, hopefully my strong centre will choke him up...somehow...} 19. Rxc8 Bxc8 20. Bd4 {WHY didn't I play 20.Bc5 --- ????? Silly of me to have missed that. I was rather concentrating on getting my bishop and queen to power down the long diagonal into Black's kingside, which has massive holes in it due to the little outing of Black's dark-squared bishop.} Bxa3 21. Qa1 f6 22. g4 {Black blocks my powerful diagonal, so I play for g2-g4-g5 to try to dislodge that pesky f6-pawn.} Qd6 23. g5 Bc5 {How irritating!!! However, if I exchange bishops, then exchange pawns on f6, I have a protected passed d-pawn, and I think can win the subsequent endgame.} 24. Bxc5 Qxc5+ 25. Qd4 Qxd4+ 26. Nxd4 {Queen exchanges? Bring them on! As I detailed above, I am optimistic about an endgame resulting from this position. (How wrong I was...)} Kg7 27. gxf6+ exf6 28. Rc1 {Planning to annoy Black with 29.Rc7+, and to try to pick up some material.} b4 29. Nc6 {Forcing a knight exchange.} Nxc6 30. Rxc6 {I wanted to keep my pawns connected, so I chose 30.Rxc6 over 30.dxc6.} f5 31. e5 {Yay!!!!!! TWO connected passed pawns on the fifth rank. How could I possibly lose (or draw) this??? (That's a rhetorical question by the way)} Re8 32. e6 Kf6 33. d6 {This move gets a ?? Here, I foresaw 33...Bxe6 34.Bxe6 Rxe6 35.d7! and White's pawn cannot be stopped from queening. What I had NOT seen, however, was} Bxe6 34. Bxe6 Kxe6 {34...Kxe6! Now, White has lost that lovely e-pawn, which will soon be followed by the d-pawn. The best White can do is pick up the b-pawn and settle for a 3-for-2 pawn deficit.} 35. Rb6 Rc8 36. Rxb4 Kxd6 37. Rb7 Rc7 {Exchange rooks in THIS position? When I'm down by a pawn??? Not likely. My king will not be able to reach Black's pawn structure in time to kill those pesky kingside pawns.} 38. Rb8 Ke5 39. Re8+ Kf4 40. Kf2 {Too late, I realise that the f-pawn will go. I had definitely reached the "Lost" stage by now :(} h5 41. Rg8 Rc2+ 42. Kg1 Kxf3 43. h3 Rg2+ 44. Kh1 g5 45. h4 {Hoping for 45...gxh4?? 46.Rxg2. Hope Chess. But then, what else could I have done?} g4 46. Rf8 f4 {OK all, now it's time for a stunning drawing resource. Really stunning. Yes, really. Really really. OK, fine, just wait and see then!} 47. Rxf4+ {47...Kxf4 48.Kxg3 g3 49.Kh3! and Black cannot advance: 49...Kf3 is stalemate.} Kg3 48. Rf3+ {ANOTHER stunning drawing resource ----> OK, fine, it is part of the first one. 48...Kxf3 or 48...gxf3 is stalemate. Black's only other option is the following, which results in a king-and-wing-pawn drawn endgame:} Kxh4 49. Kxg2 gxf3+ 50. Kxf3 {Try as Black might, this position is always, always, always a draw. Either White's king sits in front of the pawn unstoppably, or Black's king gets trapped in front of the pawn.} Kh3 51. Kf4 h4 52. Kf3 Kh2 53. Kf2 Kh1 54. Kf1 Kh2 55. Kf2 h3 56. Kf1 Kh1 57. Kf2 Kh2 58. Kf1 Kh1 59. Kf2 h2 60. Kf1 {We got there eventually. Black realised that it was a draw. This, I think, is a very interesting game to look at. I eagerly await your opinions!!!!!}
