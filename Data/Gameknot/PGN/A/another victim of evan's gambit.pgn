[Opening "Evans gambit (C52), compromised defence, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 {It starts with the Italian opening, or guioco piano.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {There are a few things black can do here. 3... Bc5, which was played, 3...Nf6 which follows by 4 Ng5 which is another aggresive opening worth for a study, 3...Be7 and some players play 3...h6 because they really don't like 4Ng5 but still want to play Nf6. Usually after those moves, I play 4d4 and open up the board.} Bc5 {This is a normal reply.} 4. b4 {This is the start of the Evan's gambit.} Bxb4 {Black accepts the gambit. It is the most common reply. White will make up for the lost pawn for rapid expansion and a strong attack which we'll see later.} 5. c3 {c3 with tempo. There are usually 3 moves that people play here. Ba5, which is the most common, Bc5 and Be7. All have its pro's and con's.} Ba5 {Ba5 is the most common in this position.} 6. d4 {This opens up the board. But if you never played the Evan's gambit and look at the board, you will see that the c-pawn is pinned and that the d-pawn is attacked two times. So black usually grabs it.} exd4 {White is now down 2 pawns. But he will not retake this pawn.} 7. O-O {Black must feel really comfortable here. 70-0 almost looks like a desperation move. Black feels very well about this position. Black sees that he can take another free pawn.} dxc3 {White takes the third free pawn and white is down 3 points and the queenside is wide open. But this move dxc3 is actually not that good. Nge7 is a lot better. I would advise to play that if you ever play this opening as black.} 8. Qb3 {8Qb3 this looks like another desperate move to retake the pawn. However if you take a longer look there is a valid threat. Qe7 or Qf6 is called for. But black will just try to develop more.} d6 {8...d6 This move is a very bad move. It looks like a normal developing move and it would be a good move in different circumstances.} 9. Bxf7+ {9Bxf7 check} Kf8 {Ke7 was probably better, though it has the threat Bg5+ pinning the queen. But the knight can move in front of it.} 10. Bxg8 {If black want to take back the bishop, he has to do it with the rook. } Rxg8 {Rxg8} 11. Ng5 {Ng5 a devastating move. Now if black doesn't do anything he will get Qf7 checkmate.} Ne5 {One of the ways to stop the mate.} 12. Nxh7+ {Nxh7+ and black resigned! the black rook is lost, because the king cannot move to f7 to protect it. If he plays Ke7 there is another surprise Bg5+ losing the queen. If you ever come across this opening as black then I would advise to play differently but try to find the better moves for black.}
