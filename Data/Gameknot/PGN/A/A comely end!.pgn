1. e4 {Standard move.} e5 {Also, usual.} 2. Nf3 {I think this is the best response; it develops a piece.} Nc6 {Also good!} 3. Bc4 {I prefer Bb5 via Ruy Lopez.} Nd4 {OK, I don't like this move very much. It must be sorta common} 4. Nxe5 {I think this is OK.} Qg5 {! Probably good.} 5. Ng4 {Blocking Qxg2. I wonder what would happen if White went Nxf7?} d5 {! Attacking the Bishop and Knight!} 6. Bxd5 {Probably OK.} Bxg4 {! Forcing f3.} 7. f3 {Practically forced.} Bxf3 {! Very nice! Forces...} 8. gxf3 {Now, Black can penetrate White's Kingdom.} Qg2 {Attacking the Rook and f3-pawn!} 9. Rf1 {Now, after Blacks next move, there is a mate in 4. Please find it!} Be7 {!! White resigns!}
