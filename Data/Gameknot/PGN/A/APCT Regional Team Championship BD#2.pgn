1. c4 {This game is from APCT's Regional Team Championship which it held every 2 years; The USA being divided into 7 regions. The southern Dixie team won this one, and another; tho Pacific always made strong showings too. In this event, I play 2nd Board for the midwestern "Plains" team under 1st BD Jim Davies (M), a strong Master from Missouri. My opponent Brad Jenison is a strong and well known player from "Dixie" , who simply has a moment of inattention during the opening. I think we have probably all committed a similar mistake that has cost us a game, or a narrow & harrowing escape if not. I can honestly say, at this point on my way up to the Master title from here, no one got any narrow escapes . . . But I think That can be said of most All players in the 2180 - 2210 area for the first time ~! Even after crossing the 2100 mark, players become Much More HUNGRY than before! Look for it, and Beware, Ye who face their wrathful appetites. lol    } f5 2. d4 {We are in a Dutch Defense. I have often called it my "Lucky Opening" vs Queen Pawn type openings by White. (VS 1.e4 my Luck is with the black side of the Ruy Lopez, and I think even my GK games may bear that out to some extent.) An opening where I cannot dismiss the feeling of receiving better than I deserve, at times. Other examples being my Draw with CGM Ian Brooks while at APCT (which is online at some d-bases) and an exchange-sac Win at APCT also, vs Expert player Hal Stone ... who was involved in the programming of one of the very first mainframe computers! In 2001 A Space Oddyssey; "How about a nice game of Chess, Dave?" asks their spaceship's computer, "HAL". Hmmm. Makes you wonder ... I guess I should have Asked about that~! You really Do meet the most interesting people while playing Corr. Chess~ (Which is of course the very purpose of my 'Name-dropping', to say to everyone, 'Keep playing, and you will meet many great players & personalities too!')  . . . This game continues in proper Dutch fashion for a bit.  } e6 {I have sometimes wondered if it matters whether 2...Nf6 is played instead. That may be a bit more flexible, leaving WT to wonder if BL will play ...e6 at all, or go without it into Lenningrad Dutch lines where ...d6 & ...g6 may be played without it & perhaps save a tempo when/if ...e5 is played. Or BL might also play ...b6 & may transpose to Dory Defense lines with Bb7 & Ne4 against Nf3.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {A most common Dutch Defense position. From here BL will have many options to select from. He might seek to play ...d5 and enter a Stonewall formation, perhaps the best known form of Dutch. Also well known and very popular is a Leningrad formation where BL will fianchetto his Bg7. And yet another, the Modern Dutch is typified by the move ...d6 being played, and has two main themes. The first attempts to create and hold a strong point at e4, which he will likely occupy with the piece as well, such as the Nf6, after fianchetto of the Bc8 to Bb7. This may easily be transpositional to or from the Dory Defense. [Also similar to positions from the ...b6 lines of the Nimzo-Indian, advocated by R.J. Fischer tho the KB there is usually exchanged on c3 after playing Bb4, making that the major difference and perhaps the pawn structure if WT recaptures by bxc3, but if not then even that aspect is quite similar. I feel this holds advantage over the ...b6 and play of the Queens Indian, and  perhaps RJF had a like preference since he did play and advocate the Nimzo line.] Finally, a Modern Dutch with ...d6 may forsake the ...b6 finachetto and instead play to attempt enforcement of an ...e5 push as the basis of his play. Or may opt to keep the center reactive while trying to gather pieces for K-side attack. Tho one should expect a Center strike to occur in response to any wing attack initiated without center play being first resolved ... BL can hope to react to that in such way that the Center does resolve from being a fluid pawn situation into one that becomes closed, or more likely becomes fixed while becoming only semi-open, rather than fully open or remaining as a fluid instrument of attack for the WT player. Admittedly, two very different approaches. However if one is familiar with the Bird's Opening, it has been noted as being such that the WT side there, with his Dutch-like position often CAN initiate and prosecute K-side attack effectively Without first resolving the center. And there, BL often finds that a Q's wing attack is too slow in reply. And even his center strike that opens the d-file or plays ...d4 with a closed but restrictive center, will be insufficient and ineffective against the WT player. This is a peculiarity common to Dutch type pawn formations, which I do not know to exist in others. At least not from any openings that I have played & attained great familiarity with. I welcome you the readers to post any comments to the contrary, if you believe you have seen another opening with such a feature commonly present.  }8-)  } 4. Nf3 Ne4 {BL moves the same N, the only developed piece, twice; what is he Doing?! Well, he knows that this will ease future  pressure on d5 and the difference in development does not reach significant difference (he hopes!) between the two players for a d4 opening ... where it is usually most important Where a piece can/does go than how quickly they come out. In no way is BL playing for the trap that the game goes into. Just to try for a more simplified unbook position and try for equality in a bit. Wt can react energetically here with d5, BL hopes will be only transpositional. Or he can play his Q to touch the Nc3 square. Or e3. Or as he does. All should be playable to various degrees .... which I never got to investigate fullly before retirement from Postal. It is likely there will be little to recommend the BL treatment unless he were willing to draw a game. [And might have to "work" for that if WT plays on stubbornly, aka is a "dixie" player! But BL knows his success was always from working a bit harder and more hours than some. So nothing is new there.  This is what I must do, not a "natural" Chess player ... and even then if you wish to master the game, superior execution will take you only so far. You must know more at some point. So that you can present inferior options to an opponent, give him difficult decisions, that you know the answers to. Don't take this as a note to the game. Just some advice for those with Chess hunger. When you work hard and learn, some "luck" follows.] Btw, Bf4 here could get quite "interesting" and I'm no longer sure for whom. Maybe someone will let me know :)} 5. Nxe4 fxe4 6. Bg5 {"Zwishen-Zugs win games!", ccmcacollister.  But not this zwishen-zug ... (This is a perfect example why we must always look Beyond simple moves or captures to see what comes Next; rather than telling ourselves the opponent "Must do" what we think is obvious~! ALWAYS looks beyond captures, and beyond the final capture of your combinations. Always~)} exf3 {which BL can answer with this Zwishen-Zwishen-Zug~! ... or Counter-ZZ if you prefer. (This shows why we must also "Always check for Checks", per FM Mike Blankenau, USA Top-Ten-Juniors' trainer. Or also an example of my own Mate Avoidance Technique; to look for every piece that could capture your King in two moves, or move within 2 squares of it. If you do this, you will NEVER be Checkmated unexpectedly ... if it is unstoppable you at least have the option to Resign before Mate) } 7. Bxd8 Bb4+ {...and this Zwishy too. Is 7...fxg2 also playable? Analyze that move ... the answer is on the next page. } 8. Qd2 {How about BL trying to play 7...fxg2 before ...Bb4+ ?  . . .    NO~! You must not play 7...fxg2 due to 8.Bxg2! Bb4+ 9.Kf1 and BL does not regain a Queen nor take WT's Queen. It may have appeared playable if you looked only at 7...fxg2 8.Bg5 Bb4+ 9.Bd2 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 gxRh1/Q or even 7 ...fxg2 8.Rg1 Bb4+ 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Kxd2 gxBf1/Q 11.Rxf1 Kxd8. However, this is why you must Always look at every combination sequence Forward, Backwards & Sideways. FBS ... meaning Every response move & every move Order too. And did you also Remember; To Look Beyond the final capture as well~?   Yes?!   Very Good~! ... you are on your way to playing like Tal ! .... Or at least like a minor Postal Chess Master from Iowa :) } Bxd2+ 9. Kxd2 fxg2 {And this Zwishy.  ( Zwishen-zugs win games, btw )} 10. Bxg2 Kxd8 {And thanks to WT for letting it play out, an obvious courtesy on his part. Being a strong player there is no doubt he saw all this as soon as exf3 was played ... more likely while waiting for my post card with that move. I've been in that situation as well. Which gives me the chance to take a Pepcid, realize it is my turn to err,  & accept the inevitable. At this level, no one would bother to do any Wishful thinking in such a case; and it would not have been uncommon either to have gotten a Resignation before ever sending off the winning move.  Just a moment of inattention in the opening, before really putting mind to a young, safe-feeling position. I have witnessed this type error happen to Master, IM & even a GM. But Not Very Often!! The moral of the story; we must come ready to play Every move. You all know, it only takes O N E  . . .  ;)   * * * * * * *  To the up and coming tactician, I hope you were able to learn something from my annotation; or enjoy my miniature if you are already beyond the advice herein ...
