1. c4 {Very rarely seen in blitz. I don't know how to play against it, so I tried to transform it in my Icelandic gambit, by transposition. } d5 2. cxd5 Nf6 3. d3 {A passive outcome. White now has to be careful about fianchettoing the lsb. } e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 5. Bg5 {Aggressive, but wiser would have been to open the way for the powerful lsb on g2.} Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Qd4 {Threatening a nasty fork check. } 7. Bxf6 Qxf6 {Still threatening it. } 8. Qa4+ Nc6 {Only one to save the bishop. Now white misses his lsb a lot. } 9. Qb5 {Attacking but overseeing...} Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Qxc3+ 11. Kd1 Qxa1+ 12. Kc2 Qxa2+ 13. Kc3 {I sensed a mate somewhere, but my knight is pinned. So, probably, the best move is just...} O-O {! IF Qxb7, it just opens columns for my rooks. Note that white is extremely undeveloped, and -6 in material. Enough for resigning. I didn't expect such a result when I felt somewhat unsecure in the opening. }
