1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {Both 1. ... e5 and 2. Nf3 have been the classical response.} f6 {A mistake by Black. White may take the pawn with 3. Nxe5 because retaking with 3. ... fxe5 would result in 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8 or an attack after 4. ... Ke7 5. Qxe5+ Kf7 6. Bc4+, with the rest of White's pieces coming out over time. 2. ... d5 is the best move. There are quite a few other moves, but, in the end, the only chance for Black after White plays 3. Nxe5 that does not lose instantly is 3. ... Qe7, but White has a big advantage after 4. Nf3 Qxe4+ 5. Be2 because of his huge lead in development. } 3. d4 {Perhaps it was White who made the bigger mistake.} d5 {Both players are pushing their pawns for control of the center. Ultimately, though, this is not the best move for Black. White can now play 4. dxe5.} 4. dxe5 dxe4 5. Qxd8+ {A good move by White. Note that Black's king cannot castle after 5. ... Kxd8.} Kxd8 6. Bc4 {A blunder, as White has left his knight on f3 open to capture by Black's pawn. However, Black, too, fails to see it.} Be7 7. Be3 {White again making no attempt to do anything about the knight.} Bg4 8. exf6 {While it may appear to be a simple pawn exchange, after 8. ... Bxf6 Black's kingside structure is not very strong.} Bxf6 9. Bg5 Bxf3 {Both White and Black have been making very large mistakes here. Black, now, could have taken with the pawn. Perhaps White was simply employing what Robin Shaw coined as 'blufftics,' and Black thought that there was a trap set for him in case he took with the pawn. In the end, one can only look at the board and wonder what was going on.} 10. Bxf6+ {If White had played 10. gxf3 Black could have captured the bishop on g5 and won a piece.} Nxf6 11. gxf3 exf3 {White is down a pawn, but his bishop on c4 is very strong compared to Black's knight on f6. Note that both players have weak kingside structures.} 12. Nd2 {White now prepares to slaughter the pawn on f3. Black can't defend it.} Nc6 13. Nxf3 Ke7 14. O-O-O Rad8 15. Rhe1+ {White's two rooks are now a very formidable fighting force down on the first rank, with two open files before them.} Kf8 16. Bb5 {White is aiming to win the knight. If the pawn on b7 recaptures, White can take the rook on d8, check the Black king, and then win the second Black rook.} Rxd1+ {Black is not so keen on such an eventuation.} 17. Rxd1 Kf7 18. Ng5+ Kg6 19. h4 Kh5 {It may be a bit foolish of Black to be moving his king so much around the board, seeing that White has the advantage and might encircle him with his very active pieces.} 20. Rh1 Ne5 {Note that by this time, the area around the Black king is very tight, and White takes advantage of that.} 21. Be2+ Kg6 {Black could also move either knight to g4 to defend against the check.} 22. Rg1 h6 23. Ne6+ Kf7 24. Nxc7 Ne4 25. Bh5+ {A desperate move by White. He doesn't really seem to have a plan, and goes for a simple check.} g6 26. Bd1 Nxf2 {A big mistake by Black. For now White can win his knight.} 27. Rf1 {The rook pins the knight to the king, and, just like with the pawn on f3 earlier, Black is powerless to do anything about it.} Ke7 28. Rxf2 Rd8 29. Rd2 Rxd2 {Black ignores the general principle that says you shouldn't trade pieces when you are down on material. It is especially important here as all Black has is a very weak knight on e5.} 30. Kxd2 Nc4+ 31. Kc3 Ne3 32. Be2 Kd7 33. Kd3 {Not the best move by White. Black can now play 33. ... Ng2 and capture the pawn on h4.} Ng2 34. Nd5 Nxh4 35. Ke4 h5 36. Kf4 Kd6 37. Ne3 a6 38. Kg5 Nf5 39. Nxf5+ gxf5 {White, obviously, is now winning, as the two Black pawns next to the king will disappear shortly, but he still has to promote a pawn as checkmating with just a king, bishop and three pawns versus two pawns and the Black king could prove pretty tricky.} 40. Kxf5 h4 41. Bf3 {For most of the succeeding moves, White simply shows how powerful his bishop really is.} h3 42. Bxb7 a5 43. c3 Kc5 44. Kg4 h2 45. Kg3 Kc4 46. Ba6+ Kc5 47. Kxh2 Kb6 48. Bf1 a4 49. Kg2 Ka5 50. Kf3 a3 51. b3 Kb6 52. Ke4 Kc5 53. Be2 Kb6 54. Kd4 Ka5 55. Kd5 Kb6 56. Kd6 Ka5 57. c4 {Black now has little hope. The best he can hope for is for White to blunder or a stalemate.} Kb6 58. c5+ Kb7 59. c6+ Kc8 60. Bg4+ Kd8 61. c7+ Ke8 62. c8=Q+ Kf7 63. Qe6+ Kg7 64. Ke7 Kh7 65. Bf5+ Kg7 66. Qg6+ Kh8 67. Qh7# {A good display of creating a winning position, this game probably would have been a lot shorter if White had originally played 3. Nxe5, but the whole adventure was aesthetically pleasing all the same. If you wish to leave me a suggestion for an annotated game, or want to leave me feedback, please drop me a message. Your help is appreciated.}
