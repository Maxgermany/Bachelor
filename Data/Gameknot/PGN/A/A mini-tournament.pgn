[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence, Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 {"Best by test" Bobby Fischer} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The spanish its popular even at patzer levels.} d6 {Entering into the old Steinitz Variation of the Ruy Lopez.} 4. d4 {The most popular continuation.} Bd7 5. O-O {5.-Nc3 was also possible, while  5.-Bxc6 Bxc5 6.-dxe5 Bxe4 its out of question nothing but equality.} exd4 {The tension should have been mantained.} 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 {Allows the centralization of white's queen.} 7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 8. Qxd4 Nf6 9. c4 {Establishing an academic Maroczy Bind formation.} c5 {A clear mistake, weakening d5 and d6. Now white has a clear plan: Double rooks on the d file and press the backward pawn.} 10. Qd3 g6 {Continuing with the mistakes. Be7 was needed in order to defend the weak d6 pawn.  10.-...a6 in order to obtain counterplay by b5 and mine the maroczy bind should have been triyed instead. But what can black do after white's 11.-a4?} 11. Rd1 Rd8 12. Nc3 Bg7 13. Bf4 Bf8 {Accepting the mistake that g6 was...but it is too late.} 14. Rd2 {Nd5 was very strong as well, to ocupy the weak square d5 with a piece.} Qg4 15. Qg3 Qxg3 {The exchange of queens only increases white's positional advantage.} 16. Bxg3 Be7 17. Rad1 O-O {The pawn was lost.} 18. Bxd6 Bxd6 19. Rd2xd6 Rxd6 20. Rxd6 Ng4 {a move without a purpose. Kg7 was indicated.} 21. Rd7 b6 {Pasive defense should have been triyed, this was the moment for Rb8.} 22. Rxa7 Rd8 23. Nd5 Nf6 {A blunder, the rest require no comments.} 24. Nxf6+ Kg7 25. Nd5 Re8 26. f3 h5 27. Rb7 Ra8 28. a3 Ra4 29. Nxb6 Rb4 {A positional sacrifice. Black gives the rook with no apparent compensation in order to give white a whole piece up (psychologycal pressure) and a passed pawn. Sarcasm its welcome.} 30. axb4 cxb4 31. Nd5 b3 32. c5 {Black resigned.}
