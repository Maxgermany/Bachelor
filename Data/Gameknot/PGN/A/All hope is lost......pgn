[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Scandinavian variation"]

1. e4 {A usual move.} Nf6 {Alekhine's defense.} 2. Nc3 {Not too bad. I like e5.} h6 {? A poor move in the Opening. I think best is e5 or d6.} 3. d4 {Smooth.} d6 {Probably best. To stop 3.e5.} 4. Nf3 Bg4 5. Bb5+ {I believe that this is a waste of time; all black can do is c6 (which kinda improves his game) and white must retreat.} c6 6. Ba4 {See what I mean?!} Qd7 7. h3 Bxf3 {Probably best.} 8. Qxf3 h5 {Really, why do this?} 9. Bf4 a6 {Again, the same question....?} 10. d5 {I prefer 0-0-0 or 0-0} a5 {? Not really doing anything, right?} 11. O-O e5 12. Bg5 {Threatening Bxf6 gxf6 Qxf6 winning a pawn!} Ng8 {I prefer Be7.} 13. Ne2 {Hmm, not really best, as you'll see!} b5 {! After Bb3, a4 winning the Bishop!} 14. Bxb5 cxb5 {Now, I think, whites in trouble...} 15. b3 Na6 {NOW black develops....} 16. a3 Rc8 17. Rfc1 {I think Rac1 was better...} f6 18. Bd2 Rb8 {? Losses a pawn....} 19. Bxa5 {Now white is down by 1 pawn.} g6 {Not really a *helpful* move.} 20. Qe3 Nh6 21. c4 Nf7 22. Nc3 {Attacking b5.} Rc8 {? A really really BAD move.} 23. Nxb5 {Now the material is equal, but the position is not! White has 2 pass pawns!!} g5 {It doesn't seem black cares, yet....} 24. Qb6 Nc5 25. Rc3 {? Hmmm, why do this? It just losses a pawn (on e4) Why not Nc3?} Nxe4 {See! See!} 26. Re3 Nc5 27. Qa7 {Trade...?} Rg8 {Um, why?} 28. Qxd7+ Kxd7 29. Na7 Re8 30. b4 Na4 31. b5 {Always PUSH a pass pawn.} Ra8 32. Nc6 {This is called a "Monster"} Nc5 33. b6 Bh6 34. b7 {! Bye bye rookie!} Rgb8 35. bxa8=Q Rxa8 36. Rb1 {I think that white has an advantage, don't you?} Ke8 37. Bb4 g4 {I think black's wasting time....} 38. Rg3 {? Not really wise.} f5 39. Bxc5 e4 {?? Huh? Why not just take this Bishop.} 40. Bd4 f4 41. Rgb3 Kd7 42. Rb3b7+ Kc8 43. Rb7b8+ {It's all down hill from here...} Rxb8 44. Rxb8+ {White has an easy win, I think.} Kd7 45. a4 {Just push the a-pawn in.} f3 46. g3 e3 47. Bxe3 Ne5 48. Nxe5+ Kc7 {? Why not dxe5?} 49. Rh8 {This works, so does Nc6!} Bg7 50. Rh7 dxe5 51. Rxg7+ {Resigns. Happy New Year!}
