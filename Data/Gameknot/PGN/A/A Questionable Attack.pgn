1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {This was a mini-tournament where this was the starting position for all the games.} 4. e5 Ne7 {Usually transposes to the mainline.} 5. Bd2 {The main line response here is 5. a3. } c5 {Black's main freeing move.} 6. dxc5 {6. a3 is usual.} Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 {Defending against the knight going to b5.} 8. Bd3 Nd7 9. O-O Nc6 10. Re1 h6 {Black seems to be making too many pawn moves in the opening. But I wanted to castle on the king-side so I wanted to prevent Ng5.} 11. Nxd5 {Here begins the questionable attack. My higher-rated opponent throws caution to the wind.} exd5 {I could not allow the destruction of my pawn-center without compensation.} 12. e6 Nf6 {12. ... fxe6 13. Rxe6+ Ne7 14. Bg6+ and Black's attack looked fierce.} 13. exf7+ Kxf7 14. Nh4 Rf8 {14. ... Re8 15. Bg6+. } 15. Bxh6 {I'm not sure how he intended to follow this up, but my king without a pawn shield worried me.} Bxf2+ {Surprise! My own pieces are developed enough to counter-attack.} 16. Kxf2 {16. He couldn't afford to lose too much material.} Ng4+ 17. Kg1 Qxh4 {White's pieces are loose. i'm up a minor piece for two pawns, the bishop is hanging and I have a mate threat.} 18. Qf3+ Kg8 19. Qxd5+ Kh8 20. Bf4 {The piece is lost.} Qf2+ 21. Kh1 Qxf4 22. Qh5+ Qh6 {22. ... Nh6 23. Rf1 Qd6 24. Rxf1 Qxf1 25. Rf1 Qd8 and although I might be able to stem the attack, I'd rather simplify immediately.} 23. Re8 Bd7 {23. ... Rxe8 24. Qxe8 #. } 24. Rxa8 Rxa8 25. Qxh6+ gxh6 {This is won. 25. ... Nxh6 is slower in allowing the king out.} 26. Kg1 Rf8 27. Re1 Re8 28. Rf1 Kg7 29. Bc4 Nce5 30. Bd5 Ne3 {}
