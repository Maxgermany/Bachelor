1. e4 c5 {The sicilian defence. I think this is the best response to 1.e4 but that's just my personal opinion} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 {Hmm this isn't so popular. Common alternatives are 2.e6, d6 or Nf6 } 5. Qxd4 b6 {This isn't commom either. I expected d6 or e6 } 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. Be3 e6 8. f3 {Logical development so far. I have a yugoslav kinda setup. I planned to castle queenside and pawn storm my opponent kingside if he castled there} Bc5 9. Qd2 Bxe3 10. Qxe3 {... } Ne7 11. h4 O-O 12. g4 {And the pawn march begins! } d5 13. O-O-O {While I attack my opponent's kingside, he begins a central counter attack. This is usually a good idea if one wants to have counterplay whatsoever} Qc7 14. e5 {It was from here I began to drift a little. This losses a pawn I think } Nc6 15. Qg1 {?! Like I said earlier, my play began to dwindle. The queen supports a g-pawn push but the rook would have been better suited for the job} Qxe5 16. g5 Rad8 17. Bd3 {I would need all my pieces in the attack if I want it to be successful } Nb4 18. a3 Nxd3+ {That bishop was just too powerful on that diagonal to ignore. Besides retreating the knight would have lost valuable tempo} 19. Rxd3 Qf4+ 20. Kb1 Ba6 {White tries to force the rook to leave the defence of the f-pawn. Retreating to e3 only encourages white to play d4 which would win a piece } 21. Ne2 Qf5 22. Rd2 Bxe2 23. Rxe2 Qxf3 {White nabs a second pawn... Its now do or die for me because if this game reaches an end-game, white's two extra pawns should be decisive..} 24. Rg2 {I had a hard time deciding whether to put this rook on g2 or h2. It turned out this rook would be the brave soldier that would save the black nation} Rdc8 25. h5 {Like I said, its do or die} d4 26. g6 fxg6 27. h6 {! A pawn sacrifice to fully open the g and h files for me.} gxh6 28. Rxh6 {It was immediately after I played this move I realised that Rxg6+! Was far better. If he played Kh8 then Qxd4+ puts black in serious trouble. Playing hxg6 fails to Qxg6 Kh8 Rxh6#} d3 {This turned out to be blacks losing move. He should have payed more attention to his defence. Now I breakthrough by force } 29. Rgxg6+ {! Solid. My opponent can't take the rook as Qxg6 would be checkmate } Kh8 {The best place for the king as Kf7 losses to (30. Kf7 31. Rxh7+ Ke8 32. Rxe6+ Kd8 33. Qd4+ Qd5 34. Qxd5# } 30. Qd4+ {Now black must lose a piece} Rf6 31. Rgxf6 {! Gaining tempo on the queen while threatening Rf8# if black is careless. I was tempted to trade queens but it would have led to Qxf6 Qxf6 Rxf6 d2.... Where I would have been forced to give up my extra rook to prevent black from queening} dxc2+ {My opponent finds the best complication on board! Now where would the king go???} 32. Kc1 {The best place for the king as 32. Ka1 leads to (c1=Q+ 33 ka2 Qc4+) where black trades queen while he still has an extra queen on board. 32. Ka2 leads to [c1=N+ (33. Ka1 Nb3+) (33. Kb2 Qd3+ and he is down the exchange but he has a passed pawn on e6 and still has fighting chances.} Qd1+ 33. Qxd1 cxd1=Q+ 34. Kxd1 Kg7 {This move would have put a bind on my two rooks if the e6-pawn wasn't hanging} 35. Rfxe6 Rc7 36. Rec6 Rd7+ 37. Rhd6 Rf7 {Now I just have to find a way to double rooks on the d-file and play Rd7 to force an exchange of rooks } 38. Rc8 h5 39. Rcd8 h4 40. Rd8d7 {Now the trade is forced.} h3 41. Rxf7+ {Now my opponent resigns as after he recaptures, 42. Rh8 wins the passed pawn. The game was a well fought from both sides but I think black would have won had he payed a little more attention to his kingside... }
