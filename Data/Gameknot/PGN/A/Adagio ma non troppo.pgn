[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. Nf3 f6 {A very questionable move, but not easy to see at once. White is in no position to have action on f7... still!} 4. c3 {I don't have to be aggressive all the time! Bf5 and Nb4 are a nasty combination, so I better avoid it. Plus, I have a pawn guarding d4 if exchanges remove the d4 pawn. e3 is on the agenda very soon. } e6 {e5 would have been aggressive... and risky. } 5. Nbd2 {Black's quiet developement provides me with a plus on e4. This is the consecuence of the Ng8 not being on f6, and the lsb being closed in behind his own pawns. Very long ago, I used to consider this a good setting for black, because it seems solid. Actually, it is cramped, and black has to know very well the few possible ways of developement he has. } Bd7 {Why not?} 6. e4 {...anyway this would have come, except in case of the ugly f5. } Bd6 {I can, of course, go e5 and I will win the exchange. But I saw the shadow of a weakness on e6 I could exploit with a risky and apparently weird sac. } 7. exd5 Bxf4 {...depriving me of my best piece, but...} 8. dxc6 Bxc6 {Here, I can create a little pressure on e6. Will it be enough?} 9. Qe2 {Closing in my lsb, true, but quickness is all. } Qd7 {? First mistake. He wanted his N to be able to go e7, but...} 10. g3 {If BxN+, KxB, so I can win a tempo for the R to go to e1. Of course, I feared e5 by black, since my d4 pawn will be pinned to the king, so it was a long line to calculate. I had my bet on...} Bd6 {? BxN would have been better, so to divert my Q from the attack on e6, now more dangerous due to the pinning Bh3 (g3 causing black to lose a tempo was the key idea behind the whole thing). This seems fine, again, but...} 11. Bh3 {The only way to defend the e6 pawn and prepare Re8 is Kf7. } Bd5 {This seems a "gimme", because of...} 12. c4 {But...} Bxc4 {Black has plans!} 13. Nxc4 Bb4+ 14. Ncd2 {I love the "zen defence". e6 is still defendable by Kf7, but...} Nh6 {?? Overlooking the danger. } 15. Bxe6 Qe7 {Qb5+ is not useful after c6, since b7 is protected. So...} 16. d5 {This places solidly the B on e6, and interferes with a future possible c6. } Qd6 {Black can't castle eithe ways, and his minor pieces are in no position to threat me inmediately ... but for c6. Which is weakening. Plus, the discovered check is now possible. But the nice discovered check is not enough to win, so...} 17. O-O {Save the king, and open the way for the Rooks play!} Kd8 {From when black unfortunately played Qe6, Qb5 became a threat, since after c6, the b7 pawn is undefended, and Qxb7 threats Ra8... I realized it now. } 18. Qb5 Bxd2 {Well. I see. I have my chance to feel a little about the way Paul Morphy felt in his wonderful games... if you forgive me!:-)} 19. Qxb7 Ke7 {This seems to save black, and if I go NxB, Rhb8 kicks my Q with no place to go except c6, losing the B after the Q's exchange. So I went for a kamikaze, tactic moves that sometimes you have to find in tactic's excercises... except that it can not be there at all!} 20. Nd4 {!? Even now, I am still +1.} Rab8 {Oh, Lord, can't you see why I moved the N precisely there and not into your juicy bishop? Do you think I am a fool? ... :-)} 21. Nc6+ Qxc6 {What else? Well, Kf1 allowed QxRb8+, but black has Qe8 to shield, and Ke7 to follow for some more moves. Now it's too late. } 22. Qxc6 Rxb2 23. Qd7+ {...and Qd8# follows. Not a great game, but with some prospects to give a couple of ideas. }
