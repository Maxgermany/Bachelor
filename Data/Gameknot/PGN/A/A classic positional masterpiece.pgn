[Opening "French (C11), Steinitz, Bradford attack"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {Selman decides on a French Defense, hoping to play a slow, positional game. Beware what you wish for -- you might get it.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 {Steinitz takes the opportunity to gain a tempo.} Nfd7 5. f4 c5 {Selman tries to break Steinitz's center. But even though he removes the QP, Steinitz's KP on K5 is the real monster, cramping Selman's position fiercely.} 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 {Adding more support to the powerful KP.} a6 8. Bd3 {Slowly but surely, Steinitz's development proceeds. Selman has much less room to maneuver than Steinitz.} Nc6 9. Qe2 {Steinitz adds further support to the KP, which Selman is trying to attack.} Nb4 {A few piece exchanges could ease Selman's congested position.} 10. Bd2 b5 {Trying to gain some space on the Q-side.} 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 {With this exchange, Steinitz creates an open QB file. If he can plant a Rook on it, it can be a potential invasion route.} Qb6 13. b4 {Driving the Bishop off the diagonal.} Be7 14. a3 {Locking the Q-side Pawns and freeing his QR.} f5 {P-KB3 instead would have turned up the heat on the White Pawn at K5. Now this white Pawn is a powerfullly posted cramping force.} 15. Rc1 {Seizing the open file.} Bb7 16. Be3 {Now he forces Selman's Queen to retreat.} Qd8 17. Nd4 {Knights belong in the center! Now the horse pressures Selman's KP and controls several useful squares.} Nf8 18. O-O h5 {Selman, cramped in the center, is trying to gain space on both wings to ease his position.} 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 {This Knight is being repositioned to invade the Q-side.} g6 {Black's QB now has no scope, as every single one of Selman's Pawns are on a white square.} 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. Nd2b3 Rc8 {Selman challenges Steinitz's control of the QB file.} 23. Na5 {Attacking the B and threatening to plant the Knight on QB6.} Ba8 24. Rxc8 Qxc8 25. Rc1 {Steinitz reestablishes control of the QB file.} Qb8 26. Qc2 {Doubling on the file and threatening to invade.} Bd8 27. Nac6 Qb7 28. Nxd8+ {Weakening Selman's dark squares.} Rxd8 29. Qc7 Qb8 {Guarding his Rook, which in turn must guard the Knight on Q2.} 30. Bf2 {Threatening B-R4, attacking the Rook. Selman would then lose material, as if the Rook moves the Knight would fall.} Qb6 31. Nf3 {Selman is now forced to trade Queens in order to avoid material loss.} Qxc7 32. Rxc7 Ke8 {Now the Rook can move safely, neutralizing the threat of B-R4.} 33. Ng5 Nf8 34. Bc5 {Wins the KP.} Nd7 {Hoping to trade his Knight for Steinitz's Bishop in return for losing his KP.} 35. Bd6 {Selman resigns. The KP will fall and he has no good moves left.}
