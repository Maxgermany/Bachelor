[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 Nf6 2. g3 d5 {Black chooses a Scandanavian Defence out of his Anglo-Indian beginning. This somewhat-unconventional variation (more standard is 2...g6) has the advantage of delaying Bg2 if White takes on d5 (3.cxd5 Qxd5 and now 4.Nf3 is basically forced), and preparing for a strong attack on the kingside between ...Qh5 and ...Bh3.} 3. cxd5 Qxd5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bg2 Qh5 6. h4 {?! 6.h3 is more easily defensible and prevents ...Bg4. The text indicates that White is hoping to castle kingside in short order (whereupon a pawn on h3 would be easily picked off).} Bg4 7. Nc3 O-O-O {Both players continue development. Black has a nasty attack and lots of space, whereas White feels very cramped and now his d-pawn is pinned, as well. Kingside castling is looking more and more dangerous, but on the other hand his queenside is almost entirely undeveloped.} 8. d3 {Letting out the Bishop and offering a modicum of defense for the d-pawn--though e2 is not exactly the most reliable defender.} e5 {Black marches forward, making more space for himself, letting his own DSB into play and threatening to march on the WK.} 9. Be3 {White defends against ...Bc5 and attempts to relegate Black's QN to defense of a7.} e4 {!? This pawn, of course, cannot be won, since White's d-pawn is pinned. However, I think this move is stronger after 9...Bb4, developing, connecting the Rooks and preventing White from touching that pawn at all.} 10. Ng5 {Another option was 10.Nh2, but I decided to keep the BQ from shifting over to the queenside, while threatening to win e4.} exd3 {This pawn is still untouchable, but Black must be careful not to get too greedy too fast.} 11. Bxc6 {There are three big things to notice. First, once on e2, Black's pawn will have no clear path to the last rank; it will act as a bit of a shield for the WK, and it will be more easily won than it would be on the d-file, backed by the Black Rook. Secondly, the b7 pawn and d8 Rook are only defended by the Black King, and are therefore weak. Thirdly, after ...dxe2, the WQ will be fighting the BR for control of the d-file. Armed with this knowledge, White sets a trap with 11.Bxc6.} dxe2 {?? Black misses White's trick, thinking that he must respond to the attack on his Queen, and preoccupied with his dangerous pileup on d1. Correct was 11...bxc6 12.f3 dxe2 13.Qxe2 Bd7 14.O-O-O with an unclear, but probably equal, position.} 12. Bxb7+ {! The word 'intermezzo' means "something nasty that your opponent missed, which you can do before dealing with their threat." In this particular case, it means White picks up a free Rook.} Kxb7 13. Qxd8 {Black's cohesion is significantly better than White's, but White is up a lot of material--if he can make it count. Unfortunately his KR is trapped in a tiny, useless box, and his QN is indirectly pinned by virtue of his Queen on d8--if White moves the Nc3, Black has ...Bb4+! followed by ...Rxd8.} Bf3 14. Rh2 {Hoping to bait Black into a very favorable exchange with 14...Ng4 15.Nxf3 Nxh2 16.Nxh2.} h6 {? Black needs to be avoiding exchanges, not encouraging them. He should be focusing on getting his KB and KR into the fight.} 15. Nxf3 Qxf3 16. Qd4 {White breaks the "pin" on his Knight, freeing it to capture on e2, as well as defending b4 against any future Bishop aggression.} Ng4 {?! This is okay, but activating the Bishop would be far better. Now the BQ is tied to this Knight's defense, and Black's kingside pieces are no closer to helping the cause than they were before.} 17. Rh3 Kc8 {Black attempts to dodge the incoming artillery. I think 17...Bd6 would have been much better; he desperately needs to get his last two pieces out.} 18. Nxe2 {Finally, this pawn can be collected. The White pieces breathe a collective sigh of relief.} a5 {? ...Bb4+ doesn't accomplish anything anymore. 18...Bd3 would be a vastly superior move.} 19. a3 Bd6 {Finally, but this comes several moves too late. White's forces are finally joining up and eliminating the last of Black's most dangerous threats, and a storm is coming.} 20. Qd3 {White shores up his last weak piece and takes aim at a6. I considered 20.Qxg7?? at the time, until I realized that it hangs the WQ after 20...Be5!} Ne5 {Black brings his Knight back towards the center, but too late, and without much effect--the WQ was going to move next turn anyway. Better was 20...Rd8, I think.} 21. Qa6+ Kd8 22. O-O-O {With the WQ still defending the Ne2, White finally gets a chance to castle! It does little-to-nothing for his King's safety, but it brings a Rook over to d1 and gets the WK out of the way, allowing the White Rooks to finally connect on the back rank.} Qg2 {? This move is also so late that it no longer accomplishes anything at all, except to deny the BQ some of her mobility and invite White to activate his KR. Looking back, this is the last time Black has a tempo to get something accomplished--by throwing it away, this is probably the move that loses him the game completely. 22...Re8 looks like the best alternative to me.} 23. Rhh1 {23.Nf4 was probably more accurate.} Ke7 {Black breaks the pin, frees the Rook and makes a run for the kingside, but this square is dangerous--the White Knight can finally hop into the fray with a lot of tempo.} 24. Nf4 Qe4 {Basically forced.} 25. Nd5+ Ke6 {Black hangs another piece by walking back into this pin. His other options aren't much better, though: 25...Ke8 or ...Kf8 are met by 26.Qc8#, 25...Kd7 or ...Kd8 by 26.Nxc7 and the loss of the Bishop soon after.} 26. Nxc7+ {1-0. Black will now lose the Bishop as well, and the game shortly thereafter. His continued delaying of developing his kingside pieces and some wasted tempo in the midgame gave White all the time needed to consolidate his far-flung position and put together a winning attack.
