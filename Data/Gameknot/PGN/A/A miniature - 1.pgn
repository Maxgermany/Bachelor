1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 a6 {Weak move. } 3. Nf3 e6 {Closing the lsb in. } 4. Nbd2 Bd6 {First thematic move. } 5. Ne5 {Thematic answer. The fact to have preferred Nd2 instead of e3 causes black now can play f6. } Nf6 {Which he did not. } 6. e3 {It could have been a transposition. } O-O 7. g4 {The first attacking move. } Bxe5 8. dxe5 Ne4 {Not NxN, which leads to a Q's exchange!} 9. h4 {...in order to prevent Qh4 by Black, but allowing d4!} f6 {Black didn't go for d4, but preferred this one. I reacted too quickly with...} 10. c3 {...reinforcing my center, fearing d4. This allowed...} fxe5 {...and now Bxe5 allows Nxf2. } 11. Nxe4 exf4 {Right, leaving my N with few places to go...} 12. Ng5 {...but a very good one over here was found!} fxe3 {Oh, yes, very dangerous, but...} 13. Qd3 {...threatening mate. } g6 14. Qxe3 {Removing the offender, defending f2, and defending the in sight of h5. } Qf6 {Pressing f2. } 15. h5 {Pressing g6.} Nc6 {Prevents future WQ checks on d4 and e5.} 16. hxg6 {hxg6 allows the fork Nh7...} Qxg6 17. Bd3 {...but this is even worse!} d4 {Desperation, but nice try. } 18. Qh3 {Unfortunately, the WQ can even leave the N... and here, my opponent resigned. A possible continuation was...} Rf5 19. gxf5 exf5 20. Bxf5 Qg7 21. Bxh7+ Kf8 22. Qxc8+ Rxc8 23. Ne6+ Kf7 24. Nxg7 Kxg7 25. Bf5 Re8+ 26. Kd2 {...and black is out of resources. }
