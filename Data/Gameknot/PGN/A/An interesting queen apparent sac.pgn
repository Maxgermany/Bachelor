1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bf4 e6 4. e3 Bd6 5. Ne5 {The London basics: if f6, Qh5+, and if g6, Nxg6. } Nxe5 6. dxe5 {Another basic: it seems that I am trapping my own bishop, but in fact I am who cramp his developement. } Bc5 7. c3 {Pretty necessary, to permanently shield against d4 by black. Now black has no attack plan. } Bd7 {Just slow and plain developement. } 8. Qg4 {But I do: this attacks the kingside. } g6 9. h4 {Nothing special, but still promising, specially if black doesn't castle queenside very soon.} f6 {If I exchange, black can defend, so...} 10. h5 {...let's see what happens now.} f5 {yeah, the stonewall. Now the position seems blocked and safe.} 11. hxg6 {This had surprised my opponent, for sure. But it is simple: 11... fxQ, 12. g6 wins a (trapped) rook and restores my queen. Black can do nothing to avoid it. And if hxg, Qxg6+ is not inmediate mate, but I will win the rook in h8: Kf8 (not Ke7, Bg5+), RxRh8 and I win. } Ne7 {Even more interesting, my opponent sees it, so he plays this move. Ok, now: 1) I can play g7, with the same theme (fxQ, gxR=Q), OR 2) Qh5, and if Nxg6, Qxh7 wins material. 3) the one I played: Rxh7. } 12. Rxh7 {Now, if RxR, gxR, and again, fxQ, h8=Q. If he takes the queen inmediately, RxR+, Ng8, RxN, Bf8 (if Ke7, RxQ), g7, Qe7, g8=Q... and I still have Bh6 to press more. } Rg8 {Ok, trick over. } 13. Qh5 {Threatening g7+ (disc).} Nxg6 14. Rh6 {Very simple. The knight cannot be defended. Bg5 only leads to Be7, BxB, and black loses. Say QxB, RxQ+, KxR, Qh7+, Kf8, QxB. Or Qc8, but is a lost position for black. I could have played Rh8, and if RxR, QxN+, and I win the black queen with the bishop checks. But it was blitz, and I just went for the simple one. } Qe7 15. Rxg6 Rxg6 16. Qxg6+ {the rest of the game is without interest. I made some risky moves, and almost lost the game. } Qf7 17. Qf6 {I bet that the pawn in f6 could be defended, of which I am not sure.} Be7 {Qh8+ gives me nothing relevant, I believe. } 18. Qxf7+ Kxf7 19. Nd2 {To ensure castling, foreseeing Rh1. } Rg8 20. O-O-O Bg5 21. g3 Bxf4 22. gxf4 {I used the wrong pawn to recapture, but it's not "tragic". } a5 23. Be2 {If Rg2, Rf1. My knight can move freely. } b6 {But he gave me the chance to use the other open column. } 24. Rh1 Ke7 {Worse than worse. } 25. Rh7+ Kd8 26. Nf3 {I knew f2 was lost, but I wanted the game spicy.} Rg2 27. Ng5 Rxf2 28. Ba6 {Or Bh5. I am trying to build a mate net, or at least to go pawns grabbing myself, since my pawns are more advanced. I am accepting to lose e3, too.} c5 {Opening space for the king. Now, Nf7+ is possible due to Nd6, but I cannot cover c7 so no mate anymore. } 29. Rh6 {let's take the pawns, then. } Kc7 {or Ke7, better, and my plan slows down. Having my opponent played stronger, I would have had my work to win, due to the loss of e3 (eventually), but he didn't.} 30. Nxe6+ Bxe6 31. Rxe6 Kd7 32. Rd6+ Kc7 33. Rxd5 Rf3 34. Rd3 Rh3 35. e6 Rh8 36. Bc4 Re8 37. Rd7+ Kc6 38. Rf7 Kd6 39. Rxf5 b5 40. Rd5+ Kc7 41. Rxc5+ Kb6 42. Rxb5+ Kc6 43. Rxa5 {}
