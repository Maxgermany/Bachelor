1. d4 {Hi all; just going to do a quick runthrough of this game. As it is the mirror game to 'Activity vs. Aggression' from the same tournament, I'll focus on the same themes, as they apply to a very different game. The basics: Activity is the ability to which a player can move and threaten different squares. Aggression is the actual production of threats which the opponent must answer. Generally speaking, the player with more activity gets to make the threats. } c6 2. e4 d5 {We've transposed to a Caro-Kann, which I'm generally more comfortable with than the QGD. } 3. e5 Na6 {?! Not unseen, but not common either. The thought is to eventually bring the Knight back to c7 where it's not in the way as much as it could be on d7, or possibly advance to b4--a maneuver not usually possible in this opening because of the pawn on c6. Standard play is 3...Bf5, and honestly the biggest appeal of this move is probably that it gets off-book quickly. } 4. Bxa6 {?! This Bishop is normally quite strong in this opening, so exchanging it for a marginalized Knight right away is suspect. This is an immediate example of the game title: White trades his potential midgame activity (from the Bishop) for simple aggression. He perhaps feels that Black's broken queenside will make up for the loss of his Bishop-pair, but Black doesn't actually have to retake with the pawn... } Qa5+ 5. Nc3 Qxa6 6. Nge2 {This awkward-looking move is necessary if White is to castle kingside--now that his KB is gone, he needs another way of blocking his light squares. } Bf5 7. Be3 e6 {Let's take stock of the situation at this point. White has a slight edge in development, though he lacks his good Bishop and I'm not sure if e3 is the best place for the Queen's Bishop, but White presumably wants to leave d2 open for the Queen herself. Black retains his good Bishop, but it has few prospects as its natural spot on d6 is unavailable. Black's kingside looks difficult to develop in any case, and his Queen is somewhat trapped on the queenside all alone--not in any particular danger, but Black must beware of any nets being woven around her. With his development and space advantages, as well as the initiative, I'd give White a very slight edge here. } 8. O-O Nh6 {!? Black prepares the same maneuver again, with a twist--rather than play ...f6 and open the center with his King still vulnerable, he holds g4 against the WQ (after Ng3 Bg5), and also threatens to play ...Ng4 and ...h5 with a decent attack against the White King (especially after ...O-O-O). If White wants to get rid of the Knight, he'll have to cope with an open g-file staring right at his King--and no LSB to defend weaknesses if he's forced to play g2-g3. } 9. Bxh6 {? I don't think this is the best choice. e3 wasn't a great square for the Bishop, the worst Black does after ...Ng4 is force White to relocate the Bishop to a better spot. I think 9.Ng3 Bg6 10.Bg5 was better, as the text gives up--once more--a decent White piece for a passive Black one, for the sake of playing for aggression rather than activity. It is worth noting, however, that White has the Knights against Black's Bishops in a solidly-closed center, so White should still have an advantage there unless Black can open the position. } gxh6 10. Ng3 Bg6 11. f4 c5 12. Nce2 c4 {? The kingside is pretty well locked up for the moment on account of the threat of f4-f5, so Black moved for queenside counterplay, but the tension generated last move between d4-c5 was very beneficial to Black! Now this advance just guarantees that his DSB will be harder to develop. Better was 12...O-O-O in preparation for White's f4-f5. } 13. Nc3 O-O-O 14. b4 {? White seeks to strike at the Black castle, but this oversight just hangs a pawn and lets Black develop his Bishop with tempo. Better was 14.f5! (the computer seems to agree with me, suggesting f4-f5 pretty much every move in this area). The closed center favors White's Knights, so he should be using them to their maximum potential and abusing Black's difficult position, not pushing pawns. } Bxb4 15. Nce2 Rdf8 {Better was 15...f5! where if White takes 16.exf6 e.p. he won't be able to defend the overextended pawn and Black will have two half-open files for his Rooks. This is not bad though; Black clearly plans to push to f6 and force the center open--with the goal of freeing his Bishops, which are not so good in closed positions. } 16. c3 {Perhaps a look at why White's f4-f5 is so important is in order, since he's still refusing to play it. Consider the position as a whole: Black has the bishop-pair and an extra pawn, but the position is closed and the BQ is stuck on the queenside. Clearly queenside aggression will be difficult to manage in this situation, with only Knights to work with, and those on the kingside--so work with what's already looking strong. White has a good Rook on f1, which will be lifted by force to an extremely strong outpost on f5 after (say) 16.f5! exf5 17.a3 Be7 18.Nxf5 Bxf5 19.Rxf5. This sets White up to double on the half-open f-file in front of an isolated Black pawn--a good recipe for success. It also brings the action to the kingside, where all the White pieces already are, and gives the Ne2 a place to go (namely f4 or g3). } Be7 {It's clear in this situation that White's timely f4-f5 would activate his Knights nicely and give him very good chances despite the slight material defecit. It's also worth noting that White can essentially force Black to give up his bishop-pair, which is certainly a tempting proposition if the center ever opens up (and it will somewhat after f4-f5). } 17. a4 {? I just went over the reasons why a direct queenside attack is not going to work: namely that Black has pieces stuck over there, and White has pieces that can't get there. White should be maximizing the advantages he has, not trying to find some where there aren't any! On the other hand, Black has been playing consistently with a clear goal--he will push f7-f6 and release himself from his cramped position. } f6 18. Qd2 {Accomplishing nothing except putting the Queen in a more vulnerable location. This is probably intended to prepare Rfb1 and Qb2, but that entire plan hinges on getting rid of the Bg6--so why hasn't White played f4-f5 yet??? } fxe5 19. dxe5 Bc5+ 20. Nd4 h5 {Suddenly, Black's pieces look much more mobile than they did a few moves ago. White had an advantage in time and activity, but instead of using it to better his positioning and pose threats to Black (f4-f5! could have been played almost any time, and in fact is still good), he made pawn moves and touched his Queen just a bit--with no real plan, his advantage has simply dissipated. In the meantime, Black worked toward a single, simple goal: push f7-f6 to increase the scope of his Bishops. Now those Bishops are looking much better and White has little to show for the time he spent. } 21. Kh1 h4 22. Nge2 {22.f5! is *still* good here! It leads to a lot of variations, most resulting in most or all of the minor pieces being taken off the board (eg. 22...Bxd4 23.Qxd4 hxg3 24.fxg6 hxg6 25.h3 etc), and an 'endgame' with both Queens and two-four Rooks is still anybody's game, one pawn difference or no. } Be4 23. Nf3 h3 {The last useful thing this pawn can do is open the g-file for a Black Rook. 24.g3?! might be worth a look, though. } 24. gxh3 Qb6 {Twenty moves later, the BQ prepares to enter the game for real. The situation is still complex, with lots of pieces crammed into the center, but now it seems Black has a clear advantage. } 25. Ned4 {?? This seemingly-strong move actually fails badly to a tactical play: 25...Bxd4! 26.Qxd4 Rxf4 27.Qxb6 axb6 28.Kg2 Rhf8 and Black wins the Knight as well. 25.Ng3 was much better, though certainly White is still in a world of hurt (25...Be3 26.a5 Qc5 27.Qb2).} Rhg8 {? Black misses the tactical opportunity, and now White has 26.a5! forcing the BQ off the diagonal and giving White time to fix his mistake. However, this is still a fine positional move: Black is following his plan carefully, occupying the open lines and preparing to push in. While in this case there was a stronger, aggressive option, good, solid positional play nevertheless strengthens the Black position, just by looking for more activity on every move. } 26. Rf2 {? This has the same problem as before, though not as severe since now the Ra1 can get to the kingside in one move. } Bxd4 {Now White is completely lost. } 27. Qxd4 Qxd4 28. cxd4 Rxf4 29. Rg1 Rxg1+ {? Black can actually force the c-pawn through here with 29...Bxf3+ 30.Rxf3 Rxg1+ 31.Kxg1 Rxf3 but this is perfectly effective as well, and follows the theme of Black's play: he continually passes up tactical shots in preference to the guaranteed positional victory. Now Black just trades off the rest of White's pieces and finishes the game. } 30. Kxg1 Rxf3 31. Rxf3 Bxf3 32. Kf2 Bh5 {If the WK now goes kingside, the c-pawn promotes unchecked, and if he goes queenside, Black has 33...a5 followed by 34...Be8 and nothing will stop Black's three queenside passers. } 33. Ke3 Kc7 {0-1. White resigns, seeing there is nothing he can do. There's no way to break through on either side, and a queenside Black pawn will be promoted in short order. Many thanks to rcachero for the games; comments are much appreciated. Hope you enjoyed it! }
