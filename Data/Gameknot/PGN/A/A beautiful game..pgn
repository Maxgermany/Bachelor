1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 h6 {I always play this move, don't know if it's a good move.} 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. f4 Bb4 6. Bd2 d6 7. f5 Bd7 8. g4 {I don't know why he did this, i'm not going to caste there any way.} Qe7 9. h3 O-O-O {I'm ahead in development and castled while white is moving pawns.} 10. Qe2 {A mistake.} Nd4 {Now he lost a tempo and he can't castle because of the c2 threat.} 11. Qd1 {Only way to protect the queen and the c2} Bc6 {I see a combination that can win easily, if i take away the knight on c3, i can take Nxe4.} 12. a3 {Thank you, i even wanted to take the knight.} Bxc3 13. bxc3 Nxe4 {Here it is, cool isn't it? If he takes the knight on d4, i can go Qh4+ and checkmate next move. If he takes the knight on e4, i take the pawn with Bxe4 and threaten on c2 and on h1.} 14. dxe4 Bxe4 {He did the same...} 15. Rh2 {Except better was cxd4.} Nxc2+ 16. Ke2 Nxa1 17. Bd3 {I would take the knight on a1 first.} Bxd3+ 18. Kxd3 Qh4 {Qg3+ and a loss of a rook.} 19. Ne2 d5 20. Qxa1 e4+ 21. Kc2 Rhe8 22. Qg1 {Attacking the a7 pawn.} b6 23. Bf4 c5 24. Qb1 Qf6 25. Qb5 Kb7 {Qa6+ Kd7 Qb7++ checkmate.} 26. a4 {Wanting to go a5 and mess up my pawn structure.} a6 27. Qb3 Qc6 {If a5 then b5 is the right move.} 28. Rh1 {Wanting to double up on the b file.} Rd7 {I want to go d4, but that would leave the f7 pawn undefended.} 29. Rb1 a5 {I don't want the move a5 by black.} 30. Be3 {Losing a tempo and a bad blunder.} d4 31. Bg1 d3+ 32. Kd2 dxe2+ 33. Kxe2 e3 {A poisonous pawn.} 34. Rb2 {A loss.} Qg2+ {And he resigned, thanks for watching. :)}
