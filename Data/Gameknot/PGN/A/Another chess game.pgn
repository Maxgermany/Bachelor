[Opening "Queen's gambit declined (D30)"]

1. d4 {Arash starts with the queen's pawn opening.} d5 {Queens pawn game.} 2. c4 {Queens pawn gambit. A rather safe gambit, in my opinion.} e6 {I respond with the Queen's gambit declined. I'll also be honest with you here: I don't know anything about openings beyond this move. From here out I'm going with my best judgement.} 3. a3 {My guess is he played this to prevent Bb4.} Nf6 {"Develop the least developed piece to the best possible square"} 4. Nc3 {He develops his knight as well.} Nc6 {I develop my second knight.} 5. Nf3 {Knights royal!} Be7 {I do this to castle, as well as defend against Bg5.} 6. Bf4 {I'm pretty sure this is a good move...} Nh5 {Knight: Go away or die.} 7. cxd5 {Or trade off first...} exd5 {I was very happy to do this move because, until now, my LSB was completely trapped. I think the trade favored me...} 8. Be5 {He's trying to invade, but I think this is pointless, and a wast of time. After I press the f pawn, not only will white's DSB be forced to die, but whites f6 knight won't be able to go to e5 or g5. } f6 {Naturally, I push.} 9. Bg3 {He retreats...} Nxg3 {And I trade an inactive knight for an active bishop.} 10. hxg3 {Gotta take back with something...} O-O {King safety.} 11. e4 {He attacks the center.} dxe4 {I'm not sure if this is the best move...there's alot of variations here. Reguardless, this is what I went with. What do you think of it?} 12. Nxe4 {Material is still equal... but when I look at this, white seems to have a bit of an advantage.} Bg4 {Trying to get the bishop involved.} 13. d5 {Pressing the pawn, forcing me to move the knight.} Ne5 {I can't let it die, and this looks like a good square.} 14. Be2 {A good move.} Nxf3+ {"When pieces make contact, it is generally not a good idea to trade off, but instead, build pressure on the pieces" ...yeah, I didn't do that. Probably shouldn't have traded...} 15. gxf3 {He takes with the pawn, forcing me to move my bishop.} Bf5 {I don't like this square, but I didn't like most of the other squares either.} 16. Qb3 {Attacking the b7 square, while indirectly attacking my king (Which I didn't see).} Qc8 {I go to defend the b7 square.} 17. d6+ {And there it is. The move that killed me.} Be6 {Trying to stay alive} 18. Bc4 {And the game ends here. Feel free to comment.}
