[Opening "King's knight opening (C40)"]

1. e4 {Common opening} e5 {I often follow that same opening also} 2. Nf3 {he moves his knight...} b6 {and I follow with a stupid (soon to be proven) move} 3. Nxe5 {what I expected...} f6 {just about the only good thing that the pawns can be used for, except for resurrecting captured pieces} 4. Nf3 {he moves back...} Nh6 {also move my knight... could have chosen better moves, but felt the need to get the knight out of hiding} 5. Bc4 {no idea why he moved his bishop there...} c6 {another hopeless move by me} 6. d4 {this move exposed my knight, though the g7 pawn is defending it} Ba6 {I insist on swapping bishops... a little fight that in the end I win... you'll see} 7. Bxa6 {the predicted move, and......} Nxa6 {I win the 'quarrel...'. I often think whether or not I should get myself into that 'argument,' as bishops are worth more than knights, but how else do I get one of his good pieces near the beginning of the game?} 8. Nc3 {a response with a knight...} f5 {completely hopeless, superfluous move... of course, made by me...} 9. e5 {an excellent responding move...} Bb4 {a good move I finally saw I could do...} 10. Bg5 {a response full of intimidation... I would take the life of his bishop if his f3 knight wasn't in the way...} Qc7 {the only reasonable move to do, really...} 11. Qd3 {another forceful move aimed at taking my knight obviously} Bxc3+ {a pathetic move, just to try and get him to move his queen...} 12. bxc3 {though I'm proven wrong...} b5 {in complete dismay, I decide to use a pawn, again, for defense...} 13. c4 {well thought out move mate!} Nb4 {I see a chance here, so move my knight, in it's valour, to change the game around...} 14. Qa3 {not so good a move, but exactly fits in with my plan...} Nxc2+ {double trouble for mario... a win for me... haha!} 15. Kd2 {his superiority doesn't look as though it will hold much longer, so....} Nxa3 {A nice plan, that was...} 16. Rae1 {After losing his Queen, he must start the game next to all over again...} Qa5+ {I decide to put him in Check...} 17. Kd1 {Hhmmm... what move next?} bxc4 {may as well take one of his pawns...} 18. e6 {very well thought-out move} c3 {but I decide to not move, so move to the other side of the board again...} 19. exd7+ {Oohhh... excellent move by mariodag... I can't castle now...} Kxd7 {Ah well, not much I can do about it, so I take his pawn...} 20. Re7+ {Oh no... it seems he's up to something...} Kd6 {I'd better move....} 21. Rhe1 {Ah oh... trouble?} c2+ {I decide to put him in Check... just to get him back...} 22. Kc1 {the only move he can make...} Rab8 {I have to use that castle for something...} 23. Re1e6+ {Once again, a marvellous check made by mario...} Kd5 {I have less places to move...} 24. Re6e5+ {good move...} Kc4 {the only place I could really move...} 25. Rxa5 {Wow.... it seems that mario's beginning to turn the game around....} Kc3 {one of the only places left to move to, but good move at that...} 26. Rxa3+ {or so I thought.... what's happening?} Kc4 {There goes my game... turned around from my advantage to his advantage...} 27. Kxc2 {Just knew he'd take that... one of my last hopes...} Rb4 {I have to do my best, so start off with getting my castle out...} 28. Rc3+ {Oh no...} Kb5 {This game looks a bit risky...} 29. Rc5+ {Oh please... this shows there's no mercy in Chess, haha!} Kb6 {I have to watch where I'm moving...} 30. Kc3 {that doesn't look very good...} a5 {I have to bring in my pawn to defend my castle...} 31. Re6 {Ah oh... excellent move by mariodag...} Rc8 {I have defense though, using another castle...} 32. Ne5 {Ah oh... I can see where this is leading to...} Ng8 {I have to use my knight for something...} 33. Be3 {well, I wasn't really thinking that mariodag would move his bishop to e3...} Nf6 {To tell the truth, it helped me pick out where to move my knight...} 34. Nc4+ {Ah oh... more trouble...} Ka6 {the game is focusing around that side and section of the board...} 35. Rxa5+ {excellent move by mariodag...} Kb7 {one of the last places I can move...} 36. Kxb4 {Ah well, my castle put up a good fight.. haha.} Ng4 {hhmmm... a nice selection of pieces to take, though it won't really change the game.. haha.} 37. Re7+ {oh bother... my selection of places to move my King are becoming shorter...} Rc7 {so I'll make that move...} 38. Nd6+ {Ah oh... a mixture of good pieces like that means a lose for me, for sure...} Kb6 {I decide to play around a bit...} 39. d5+ {Hhmmm... seems nothing wrong with that move, except that it put me in check...} c5+ {I decide to 'fight back' lightly with a check of my own...} 40. Bxc5+ {another check... very well thought out move...} Rxc5 {but I do a stupid move to get rid of that annoying bishop...} 41. Rxc5 {and mariodag takes my castle with no worry of getting taken...} f4 {I decide to move one of my last pawns to f4...} 42. Rb7+ {so, now, where do I move? I can see it coming to an end..} Ka6 {Yes... a definite end...} 43. Ra5# {and there you have it... An excellent game, turned from my advantage to mario's advantage... please feel free to comment- :)}
