[Opening "French (C13), Albin-Alekhine-Chatard attack, Breyer variation"]

1. e4 {This game is taken from a themed mini-tournament and real play starts with blacks sixth move. My proper comments will start at move six.  Since publication lighttotheright have commented on a few occasions where my analysis haven't been correct. I have introduced these corrections to the annotation and marked which are lighttotherights.} e6 {The french defence. Not my favorite but it was the theme... } 2. d4 {Standard response. Grab the center while you can...} d5 {Challenge the center.} 3. Nc3 {Bolstering the center.} Nf6 {Giving White the choice to defend och stretch...} 4. Bg5 {Choosing to first pin the knight.} Be7 {Promptly unpinning the knight as well as clearing for castling.} 5. e5 {Stretching the pawn chain...} Nfd7 {Retreating.} 6. h4 {... and here the opening gets the name Alekhine-Chatard version of the French defence. The general idea is to sacrifice the h-pawn to get a swift attack going on the king side. White is hoping for BxB, pxB, Qxp and then either Nh3 or Nf3 forcing the queen to retreat. White now have a half open h-file and can play either Bd3 or Qg4 as a continuation of the attack.} c5 {But Black has other ideas. Challenge the center! This is my first move, but it's still a book move.} 7. Nf3 {White defends the pawn.} Qb6 {Black has no plan (at this point) of taking d4 with the pawn. Black instead put more pressure on d4 hoping to intice white to the exchange pxp, Nxp putting the the Black knight on a good square (c5) near the center as well as clearing d7 for the White bishop.} 8. Rb1 {White wastes a move. Black has no intention taking on b2. I was surprised to see White react to this phantom threat. In this opening White usually castles queen side as he has more or less committed to a king side attack. Although not a bad move (lighttotheright analysis), moving the rook takes queen side castling away.} Nc6 {Developing a piece and putting more pressure on d4 (and e5 mind you :-) . I feel confident at this point knowing I will have a good game. White have reacted to my moves and have forgot about his king side attack.} 9. b3 {White looses another tempo. If he wanted to protect the pawn he should have played this move directly. Better might have been 9. Bxe7 or 9. Na4 (lighttotherights analysis). The king still have two sides on his coffin...} cxd4 {BAM! I see that I can remove a pawn for free and gladly take it. [Annotation corrected after lighttotherights comment].} 10. Ne2 {The coffin now has three sides... Better would have been 10. Bxe7, Na4 or Nb5 (lighttotheright analysis)} Bc5 {The black bishop was marked for destruction, only waiting to be taken on e7 (usually the case in the french defence), forcing the king to guard duty and preventing him from castling. Now the bishop guards d4 AND forms a deadly battery along the g1-a7 diagonal.} 11. h5 {The king side thrust is too little and too late. I rebuff it with...} h6 {... a pawn stab that forces the bishop to retreat...} 12. Bh4 {... to the wrong square. e5 is under-protected.} Ndxe5 {The knight strikes the free pawn and I proclaim the center as black territory! :-)} 13. Nd2 {The lid is on the coffin... And I have a knight and a bishop ready for Nd3# or Bxf2# if the opportunity arises!} O-O {I wanted to play d3 trying to force the issue, but could not find a good continuation (if you can see one, please comment and help me improve my game).  I choose a waiting move wishing White to move either c och g-pawn but expecting 14. Nf4. Any move by the c-pawn allows me to play Nd3#. Playing 14. g3 allows me to win a piece with 14...d3!. With the threat of a smothered mate with Bxf2# White is forced to drop the knight.} 14. c4 {Remind me to use my power of wishing more often :-) d3 is unguarded!} Nd3# {The knight nails the coffin shut!   Hope you enjoyed the game.}
