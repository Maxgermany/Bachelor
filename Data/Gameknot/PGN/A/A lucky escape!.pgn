1. Nf3 c5 {In this game I was 12 minutes late, as I couldn't find the venue and then had problems parking. I was playing for Penyffordd against Formby, at The Conservative Club, Wallasey. Typical of damn Tories! In this game, I seem to be cruising to an easy win, but, perhaps suffering from what Alexander Kotov describes as "Dizziness due to success", my concentration lapses and I missed a clever tactic which would have given him a slightly better ending. Thankfully he misses it too. See if you can find it! Anywya, he opens with Nf3, The Reti. I invite a transposition to either the Sicilian Defence, with 2. e4 or an English with 2. c4} 2. g3 Nc6 {Nc6 is the logical follow-up} 3. Bg2 e5 {I am aiming for a reversed King's Indian Defence, but if I play 3....d5 then he may play 4. d4 and a reversed Gruenfeld. The Gruenfeld is a sharper opening than the King's Indian Defence and the extra tempo is more use to White.} 4. d3 d5 {So here we have it, the reversed King's Indian.} 5. O-O Bd6 {I quite like putting my bishop on this square - see Charles Higgie vs. Mike Williams annotation.} 6. Nbd2 Be6 {Normally one would expect f6 first, to prevent N(f3)-g5, but his knight on d7 has blocked the influence of his Bc1 on the g5 square. Interestingly I cannot find this Bishop move on any of the opening databases, but I can't believe it can really be bad.} 7. e4 d4 {I was pleased that he decided on e4 rather than c4. If he had played c4, I would have been tempted to exchange, as after N(g8) to either f6 or e7 he can play Ng5. Also I didn't really fancy the sharp lines of the Benoni or Benko Gambit reversed after 7. c4 d5.} 8. Nc4 f6 {After 8. Nc4 he really can play Ng5 again, so I stop it with f6. So now he can exchange on d6, but hey, what of it. The Bd6 is my bad bishop, blocked in by pawns, I don't mind exchanging it! Now my Be3, that is another question, I am going to hang on to that. I could have doubled his pawns with Be3xNc4 here, but it would have been a huge mistake to give up my good bishop, just to double his pawns.} 9. Nh4 Nge7 {I wanted to stop his knight coming in to f5, although in some positions it is worthwhile for White to give up the pawn with N(h4)-f5, in order to open the long diagonal for his bishop on g2.} 10. f4 Bc7 {So now I retreat the Bd6, to prevent him from exchanging on d6. Now he should continue with f5, continuing his king's side play. I thought a4, preventing b5 was quite a sound move too. Instead he increases pressure on e5} 11. Nf3 b5 {So I immediately reduce the number of pieces he has attacking e5. I want to always have enough pieces to recapture in e5 with a knight or bishop, rather than the pawn.} 12. Na3 a6 {So I cement my queen side space advantage. Black stands slightly better. White's plan should be to continue advancing on the king side with f5, but instead he makes a big mistake.} 13. fxe5 Nxe5 {e5 is just such a lovely square for a knight or bishop, unable to be driven away by any White pawn.} 14. Nxe5 Bxe5 {White now has a little tactic. He can get rid of his bad bishop on g2 with 15. Bh3! If Bxh3 16. Qh5! regains the Bishop. Instead he seeks to exchange my other bishop.} 15. Bf4 Ng6 {I had a choice of moving the Knight to g6 or c6. The advantages of having it on g6 is that White no longer has the queen check on h5 and in some variations I may be able to play my knight to h4. The disadvantage is that in some variations I would like to play g7-g5 to force the hand of his Bishop on f4. On balance g6 is better.} 16. Nb1 O-O {White seeks to bring his knight into play via d2 and maybe f3. I finally get round to castling!} 17. Nd2 Qd6 {I up the pressure on f4, preventing his from playing an immediate Nf3.} 18. Qf3 c4 {So he protects f4 again. Now with his queen and Rf1 tied down to the protection of f4, it is time to open another front!} 19. h4 Bxf4 {19. h4 was a blunder that leads to the loss of a pawn, but White's position was bad anyway.} 20. gxf4 Nxh4 {As well as being a pawn up, Black's bishop will be better than the White knight.} 21. Qf2 Nxg2 {It may have been better for White to play the queen to g3 and then have the option of recapturing on d3 with the queen, rather than the pawn.} 22. Qxg2 cxd3 {Black still has pressure on f4, which will make it hard for White to contest the c file.} 23. cxd3 Rac8 {Now to confuse the issue, White plays a daring pawn sacrifice, and I fell into a trap. Thankfully he failed to spot the tactic which would have saved the game for him!} 24. e5 fxe5 {So may as well take it!} 25. Ne4 Qd5 {Qd5 is actually a dreadful mistake. Find White's best move!} 26. Qg5 exf4 {As I had seen - but after I had moved Qd5, 26. f5! would have given White a good game. The points being is the White would love to play Nf6+ and either fork my king or queen, or win my queen with a discovered attack on my queen with his queen. Now for that to work either my protection of f6 by my rook on f8 has to be broken, or my bishop's protection of my queen needs be ended. So I cannot retreat my bishop to f7 because of the former, nor to d7 because of the latter. Likewise I cannot safely take on f5 without losing my queen. So I would have had to lose my bishop for a pawn, and with Knight v 3 pawns, White would have a slightly better ending.} 27. Rxf4 Qxg5+ {White now resigns, as after 28. Nxg5, Rxf4 29. Nxe6 he is an exchange and 2 pawns down. Thanks for reading my annotation, please leave a comment and rate my annotation. Many thanks!}
