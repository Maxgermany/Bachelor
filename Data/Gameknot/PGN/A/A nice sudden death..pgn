1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 {NOt recommended in this defence.} 4. e3 Bf5 5. c3 e6 6. Nbd2 Bd6 7. Ne5 Ne4 8. Qh5 {The first outburst.} g6 {Of course. } 9. Qf3 {Not Qh6, Bf8.} Nxd2 10. Kxd2 {NO prob. My king is safe in the center right now. } h5 {It's ok...} 11. Bb5 Bxe5 12. Bxe5 Rf8 {Maybe f6 was better after all. Now it starts an interesting battle for the winning of the bishops, with a delicate equilibrium between threats that make the bishop's issue untargetable... probably I should have lost the bishop, but it was very fun to play. } 13. Qf4 {Forcing into defence, but setting the f6 bishop's self trapping. } Rc8 14. h3 {If now f6, I will follow with g4. My real target is just to open columns for my rooks. } a6 15. Bxc6+ bxc6 {This makes my b pawn weak. I'm aware, but I have to attack. } 16. g4 hxg4 {I still see f6 here for black. } 17. hxg4 g5 18. Qg3 {Who will win the bishop?} Bg6 {I don't have a square to retire, so I have to improvise. Fortunately, I have a lot of ways to attack. } 19. f4 f6 {At this point, it seems my bishop will fall. But I wanted to experiment with...} 20. f5 exf5 21. Rh6 fxe5 {Qxe was easy, then I recover the bishop. But it didn't satisfied me. } 22. Rxg6 f4 23. exf4 {First obstacle against the enemy's king removed. } exf4 {? The wrong pawn! A pity. The obvious Re1 doesn't provide the win, but... (can you see that? :-). Having black played the correct one, gxf, my answer would have been Qh3, or d3. } 24. Qe1+ {To avoid mate, black has to lose the queen for a rook, as a minimum. } Kf7 25. Qe6# {}
