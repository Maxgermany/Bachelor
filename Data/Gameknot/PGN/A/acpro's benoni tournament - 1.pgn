1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. f4 Bg7 8. Bb5+ Nfd7 {Nbd7 leads a practically forced draw. If black is going to fight for a win then this is the only move he can play.} 9. a4 {Taking time out to prevent b7-b5 before the bishop is booted} O-O {more popular is a6 booting the bishop off of b5. } 10. Nf3 Na6 {A good move that deprives white the ideal square for his queen} 11. O-O Nb4 {This is nicely placed here but is not worth exchanging my bishop for so I allowed it happen. } 12. Be3 a6 13. Bc4 Re8 {preventing the e4-e5 break and adding pressure on e4. } 14. Qd2 {With e4-e5 out of the picture for now I shift my focus on to a less well known break for white. Namely the f4-f5 break. } Qa5 {Black continues to pile up his forces on the queen side. } 15. Rad1 {This is a waiting move that sets up a trap for black. At first glance it looks as though a4 is a sitting duck. However, the benoni is about punches and counter punches. } Nb6 {black is falling for it. I am sure he see that taking a4 will give him a pawn to the good. } 16. Be2 Bd7 17. f5 Nxa4 18. Bh6 Bf6 19. fxg6 hxg6 20. Qf4 {Black has focused much of his forces on the queen side and has almost abandoned the kingside} Qd8 21. Ng5 Nxb2 22. Qxf6 {}
