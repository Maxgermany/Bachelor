[Opening "Pirc (B09), Austrian attack, 6.Be3"]

1. e4 d6 {The Pirc. I had played against this opening only once in a long game. As a consequence, I only knew 5 moves of theory (at least in this variation).} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {Black is planning to fianchetto the bishop and then attack the white centre from the flanks.} 4. f4 {Meanwhile, White has a number of set-ups available, the most common are the classical variation (4.Nf3) and the sharp Austrian Attack (4.f4), which I play in this game.} Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O {The other main move is 5...c5, after which I would surely have gone for the famous drawing line 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.e5 Ng4 8.e6 fxe6 9.Ng5 Bxb5 10.Nxe6 Bxd4 11.Nxd8 Bf2+ 12.Kd2 Be3+ 13.Ke1 Bf2+ with perpetual check (there are ways to deviate for Black, but then White has a better position). I would've been very content with a draw against such a strong player, but now I'm glad it didn't end this way. After the text move I had to think on my own.} 6. Be3 {!? The main move is 6.Bd3. However, this move is the second most played move on the DB and it does prevent the normal ...c5 break. I was unaware of the theory at the time, so just tried to develop.} Ng4 {?! Played almost instantly, as if he knew that this was the refutation of my previous move. Not knowing the theory, I thought he knew what he was doing and came to the conclusion that 6.Be3!? was not so strong a move. But when I showed the game to someone at my club who plays the Pirc himself, he said that this was too early. The normal moves here are 6...b6 and 6...Nc6.} 7. Bc1 {!? Not quite what I wanted to play, but I thought it  was not a big problem because I can chase back the Knight with h3 and then put my bishop back on e3. I have then lost a tempo by playing h3, but maybe that's not a lost tempo after all as it does prepare a pawn storm on the kingside. Normal here is 7.Bg1.} c5 {And there we have it, the usual Pirc break.} 8. h3 cxd4 9. Nxd4 Nh6 {?! A strange decision. This knight is very badly placed at h6, as we'll see later in the game. Maybe he thought my opening play was bad and tried to refute it, but didn't think he'd refute it by just playing normal Pirc moves such as 9...Nf6. Or maybe he wanted to keep ...f5 as an option.} 10. Be3 Nc6 11. Qd2 {Setting up a battery. Now the threat is 12.f5, winning the knight which has no squares.} f5 {!? Natural, but according to Fritz, 11...Qa5!? is also possible. The immediate 12.f5!? is then answered by 12...Nxd4! 13.Bxd4 Bxd4 14.Qxd4 gxf5 but White still keeps a good position. The try to prepare it with 12.Nxc6?! bxc6 and then 13.f5 can now be answered by 13...Qb4! when 14.Bxh6? fails to 14...Qxb2!.} 12. Bc4+ Nf7 {?! I don't like this move. Now Black will get very cramped. I think the normal 12...Kh8 would be better.} 13. exf5 Nxd4 14. Bxd4 {Probably even better is 14.fxg6!? hxg6 15.Bxd4. I missed this during the game.} Bxf5 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 {But now the king is unsafe at g7, so a check by the White queen on d4 can be nasty.} 16. g4 {Starting a pawn storm on the kingside.} Bd7 17. O-O-O Rc8 {Black has nearly completed his development, though the knight on f7 and the bishop on d7 are very passive. Meanwhile, all White's pieces are very strong and active except for the rook on h1.} 18. Bd5 b5 {!? Trying to create counterplay, but this loses a pawn. Better is probably 18...Bc6, though the move played is not criticized by the computer.} 19. Qd4+ {Double attack from the queen. Also good is 19.Rhe1!? with a strong attack.} e5 20. fxe5 Nxe5 {I think 20...dxe5 is slightly better as the d pawn now remains vulnerable to attacks from the half-open d file. The pawn on e5 denises White the d4 square and is also somewhat easier to defend, it seems.} 21. Qxa7 {Again 21.Rhe1 was worth considering. But now there's also the threat of 22.Nxb5.} Kh8 {Stopping 22.Nxb5.} 22. Qd4 Qg5+ {In my view Black should have waited for a better moment to give check. Now it achieves nothing. The computer wants to play 22...b4!?, sacrificing another pawn, which apparently creates some counterplay. Here Black had more than an hour against some 40 minutes for me, but from this moment on he started to think very deeply at every move.} 23. Kb1 Rf4 {I suppose this was the idea of the previous check, but I don't see what Black is trying to do. Maybe he just wants to complicate matters as I was lower rated and so it would be more likely that I'd make a tactical error.} 24. Qd2 Qf6 25. Ne4 Qf8 {? This is, or rather should have been, the losing blunder. It drops another pawn. The only way to stay in the game was 25...Nc4 26.Bxc4 Rxe4.} 26. Nxd6 {! The knight is immune due to the threat on the rook. Now that the d6 pawn has fallen, Black's position collapses.} Rc7 27. Nf7+ {?? I have a tendency to overlook obvious things, especially if I have calculated some moves ahead. This move is an example. I had already seen this when I played 25.Ne4. I thought: "It's check and he can't take with the Queen as it's protected by the bishop, he can't take with the knight or move his king as the rook is attacked, so this move wins." However, I overlooked Black's obvious reply. A week before this game, a very similar blunder (but in an materially equal position) cost me a full piece. Fortunately for me, things are not so bad this time.} Rxf7 28. Bxf7 Qxf7 {?? And now I'm winning again. The correct move was 28...Nxf7, when I can't win the knight: 29.Qf4 Rb7 30.Rhf1 Kg8. The position remains better for me (and I'd have had a time advantage of about 15 versus 10 minutes) but winning this would be far from simple.} 29. Qd6 {! It's all over now.} Qg7 {!? Objectively a blunder, but Black is trying one last trick...} 30. Qxc7 Nc4 {Now I have to be careful. Black threatens mate and there are two wasys to avoid this, of which one is correct. 31.c3?? loses to 31...Bf5+! 32.gxf5 Qxc7. But I make the correct move.} 31. Qb8+ {Actually 31.Qd8+ was mate in 10, but this is more than enough for the win. Black can only interpose with his queen (or with his bishop but that doesn't make any sense at all), after which I trade queens and take the bishop, leaving black a rook and an exchange down. Black resigned here as there's no hope left, and I got my first victory over a 1700 player. Next Tuesday the second round will be played. I'm the only one of the lower-rated half who has won the first round, so I'll probably have a very strong opponent. Let's see what the next game will bring.}
