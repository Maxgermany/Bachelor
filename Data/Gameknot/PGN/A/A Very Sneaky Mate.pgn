1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {A little less common -- but in my opinion, often a little stronger -- than Qxd5.} 3. d4 {White can try to hang on to the extra pawn for a while with 3. c4, but this opens lines and aims for development over material.} Nxd5 4. c4 {Now, c4 grabs a good amount of space in the center, and allows white to continue with a little initiative in the opening.} Nb6 {This is fine, as is Nf6, or even Nb4.} 5. Nc3 Nb8d7 {?! I don't love this move, as it blocks the light-squared bishop and the queen in, and basically commits black to moving this knight a second time in short order. But there's an even bigger problem, that white overlooks.} 6. Nf3 {? Missing the way to capitalize on black's mistake last move. c5! traps the Nb6, winning a piece. Those of you who ever have a chance to play me at blitz chess will notice that my quality of play plummets precipitously; this is one small example.} c5 {Perhaps seeing the danger before white does; this move saves the knight.} 7. dxc5 {White still has a little edge, though.} Nxc5 8. Qxd8+ {Played immediately. In a non-blitz situation, I would've looked to see if moves like Be3 or Bf4 were better; in blitz I jump on the chance to move the king to a slightly worse square. Lasker's old saying, “When you see a good move, look for a better one” wasn't meant for games this fast!} Kxd8 9. Be3 {Threatening to simply win the Nc5.} Ne6 {?! A little surprising. I was expecting a move like e6, defending the knight while opening a line for the Bf8. Now the e-pawn is blocked, and the bishop will take some time to resuscitate. In the meantime...} 10. O-O-O+ {An easily parried threat, but in faster games, it's a LOT easier to be on the offensive than on the defensive. Black's options don't look great at this point: Nd7 blocks in the other bishop, too, Bd7 loses a piece (and maybe more) to c5, and King moves have their own problems (e.g., 10. ...Kf8 11. c5 Nd7 12. Bf5, with Ne5 looming).} Kc7 {?! Also not good. There isn't a lot of safety to be found on the queenside. White has some pretty strong continuations.} 11. Nb5+ {The best way to attack! Black has only two options, and one (11. ...Kc6 12. Ne5#) is out of the question.} Kb8 {White would love to play Bf4+ as a follow-up, but currently the Ne6 guards the f4 square.} 12. Ng5 {So why not play a diverting sacrifice? Black isn't obligated to take, of course, but a move like this sure is tempting!} Nxg5 {? The final mistake. Something like Nxc4 offered much more resistance. Now the house comes down.} 13. Bf4+ e5 14. Bxe5+ Bd6 15. Bxd6# {I've got a looooong way to go before I'm at all passable at faster games, but I have a feeling that with games like this, I'm on the right track!}
