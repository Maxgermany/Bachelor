1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {I initiate Petrov's defense. He thought for about a minute after I made this move. Maybe wasn't familiar with it? His game showed that.} 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Bc4 Nxe4 {I sac a knight to win back a bishop.} 5. Bxf7+ {This move caught me by surprise. I thought I was on the road to defeat with my king exposed.} Kxf7 6. Nxe4 d5 {I build a classical pawn center and give the impudent horse a boot.} 7. Neg5+ Kg6 {I make plans to pin the f3 knight and then reap the bounty. But was this good to place my king out in the open? This is often my response when it is forced to move like that. Turn it into a attacking piece!} 8. d3 {Defending the knight.} Bg4 9. h3 Bxf3 10. Nxf3 {The attack is exchanged off. I start worrying about my king so I trade queens.} e4 11. dxe4 dxe4 12. Qxd8 Rxd8 13. Nh2 {Now look for my best move.} Nd4 {!! I win a pawn and sink a knight deep into the enemy camp.} 14. Kd2 {?? A bad error. This loses a rook instead of a pawn.} Nb3+ {A painful discovered attack.} 15. Kc3 Nxa1 16. Be3 Bb4+ {Since my knight is gone I simply arrange to exchange off the bishops.} 17. Kxb4 Nxc2+ 18. Kc3 Nxe3 19. fxe3 Rd3+ {And another pawn. He resigned.}
