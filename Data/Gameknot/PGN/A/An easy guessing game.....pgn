1. e4 {Hello to everybody...This is a game that i played with a lower rated player and i actually won no points...I just did it for fun..So feel free to make any comments or rate the game... i started with e4...} e5 {He replied e5...} 2. Nf3 {Nf3 is typical...} d6 {Then he played d6 instead of other more useful movements..} 3. Bc4 {I was playing typical...} Bd7 {Again worthless move instead of developing some pieces..} 4. d3 {d3 to open th black bishop and to protect the e4 pawn...} Be7 {He was blocking his queen...An unsafe movement i think....} 5. Nc3 {I'm still playing typical...} c6 {c6? I don't know why....} 6. d4 {So i challenge d4 in order to opn the game...} exd4 {He took it...} 7. Nxd4 {Now i have two ways, take the pawn with the knight or the queen... I chose the knight in order to open the queen for the f3 square...} c5 {c5? He's still back in development and he played c5! So I had an easy plan in my mind. The plan is simple...i'd let him took the knight and i'll win the game...Of course he should have prevented that but as i said before he's a low rating player so he might took the chance and risk it...} 8. Qf3 {I played the queen in order to checkmated him then...} cxd4 {And as i guessed before he took the knight and ignored the checkmate...} 9. Qxf7# {So simple...He forgot to see at his back and at his king's defence...Hope you like it.. Bye and Dag...Haha}
