1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch is an opening in my resume } exd4 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 5. Qxd4 Nf6 6. e5 c5 7. Qd3 Ng4 8. Be3 {??? bad move on my part} Nxe5 9. Qe2 d6 {??? bad move for him as well} 10. Bxc5 {!! regaing the lost pawn } dxc5 11. Qxe5+ Qe7 12. Qxe7+ Bxe7 13. Bb5+ Bd7 14. Bxd7+ Kxd7 {I enjoy playing the Scotch because it reduces the pieces on the board and I end up playing games like this. Ending the middle game and going into the endgame with only 14 moves!} 15. Na3 {?? bad move? Not sure myself} f5 {Black is claiming more territory } 16. Rd1+ Kc8 17. Rd5 {Bad move?? } g6 18. O-O {?? At this far into the game, my king could have been turned into a fighting piece.} b6 19. Nb5 Re8 20. Nd6+ Bxd6 21. Rxd6 Re2 22. Rc1 Kc7 23. Rf6 Rd8 {!!! Black was sure playing better for the endgame. Here he had a chance to double his rooks on his 7th rank, A fatal tactic I might add.} 24. g4 {A desperate move but sound} fxg4 25. Kg2 Kb8 26. Kg3 Re4 27. Rf4 Rxf4 28. Kxf4 Rd2 29. Ke3 Rd5 30. c4 Rf5 31. Rg1 Rf3+ 32. Ke2 h5 33. Rg3 Rf6 34. h3 Rf4 35. b3 g5 36. hxg4 h4 37. Rg1 Kc7 {This is where I got scared His king is advancing into my side} 38. f3 Kd6 39. Kf2 Ke5 40. Re1+ Kd4 41. Re3 {     !! His king is now stuck. This lucky plan started when I moved my f pawn and my king} Rf6 42. Ke2 Rh6 43. Kd2 h3 44. Re4# { A quaint checkmate}
