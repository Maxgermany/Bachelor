1. Nf3 {i played this game at a mini tournament where i was about to regain rating after severe timeout losses. out of an unorthodox reti opening developed the biggest avalanche i ever experienced in chess.  also note that (despite a handful of bishop moves) all blacks pieces only move towards ONE direction ^^} g6 {yeah, why not try something new (speaking for myself only)} 2. d4 Nf6 3. d5 {this brave scout seems to loose contact with his own forces. (this move makes the diagonal for my fianchettoed bishop even juicier)} Bg7 4. Qd3 d6 5. e4 Na6 {black's working the flanks while white does some staging in the center} 6. Bd2 Nc5 {oh my, the infantry ddidnt get enough support and with blacks cavalry in sight, white's officer in command leaves the poor men on prey} 7. Qc4 Nfxe4 8. Bd3 {the first brawl in the center draws white's attention away from its army's flank...} Bxb2 {with severe consequences! white's artillery gets captured!} 9. Bxe4 Nxe4 10. Qxe4 {... but  black's cavalry gets routed and completely annihilated in melee} Bxa1 11. c3 Bf5 12. Qd4 f6 13. O-O c5 14. Qc4 Qb6 15. Na3 Bb2 16. Qb5+ Qxb5 17. Nxb5 Kd7 18. c4 Bd3 19. Rd1 Bxc4 20. Nc3 Bxc3 21. Bxc3 Bxa2 22. Nd2 Bxd5 {now here: due to the uncoordinated movement of white, blavck's officers succeeded in routing allready half of white's forces. none of blacks pawn yet was in combat they're all rested and fresh... and they just put on bajonettes and will march the enemy off the field! watch!} 23. h4 h5 24. Nf3 Bc6 25. Ne1 b5 26. g3 b4 27. Bd2 a5 28. Nc2 Ba4 29. Rc1 Bxc2 {further simplification. i know that i could have played it more straight but i was so stunned by this pawns i just wanted to let them have fun. (thats the least we can do for our pawns. give them a reason to enjoy theirselves every once in a while. too often they get sacrificed, left alone treated as if they were not worth a dime)} 30. Rxc2 e5 31. Kg2 Kc6 {yeah this is surfing a wave!} 32. f4 e4 33. Kf2 f5 34. Ke3 d5 35. Ke2 d4 36. Kf2 {of course i could have played e3...} Kd5 37. Ke2 {or here, d3 would be crushing of course... but i decided to toy} c4 38. Ra2 c3 39. Bc1 Kc4 40. Rxa5 {ok, my opponent resinged here, and i want to apologize that i showed no respect by toying around. although its not often you get such strong story telling situations on the board. and its clearly not every day that you have your 8 pawns and just march the opponent over and dont have to fear a thing. ofcourse id loved to play it down to the 1st rank but chess is a 2player game, if its not for any reason, its about to be over. like here ^^}
