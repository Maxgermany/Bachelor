1. e4 g6 {We've played so many openings, I often don't have a firm plan. Here I am simply intending to quickly castle.} 2. d4 Bg7 3. c4 {Here my opponent chooses an aggressive continuation, hoping to take advantage of black's somewhat passive play. I don't really plan to attack the center from the wings as this setup may imply. I will get my king to safety, and then see where things stand before making any plans.} c6 {Because of his aggressive pawn moves, I deviate from my plan to castle immediately.} 4. Nc3 d5 {Not the most accurate move, as it pretty much cedes a pawn and white retains a good initiative too, if white chooses to go down that path. But rather than do this, white has ideas of gaining a space advantage, restricting black, and making that positional advantage pay off later.} 5. e5 {So white chooses e5. While less forcing initially, he hopes for a long term advantage while limiting the black counterplay. After a short think, I decide on a plan at this point.} Bf5 {I will try to disrupt white's pawn structure where he intends to castle, or just trade off the 'bad' bishop, and then go from there. So it's a little plan, not a long one. Often I enjoy positions that are even not best just because it avoids known book lines. } 6. c5 {Well it's a blitz game. The last white move, c5, was not the best move but it was in keeping with his overall strategy of trying to bottle up black before attacking on one of the wings. After another short think, I decide to allow my light-squared bishop to become trapped. Several moves from now you'll see why. But in evaluating this position, which by the way, is quite horrible for black, that bishop is not worth much. I have allowed White to reduce the value of this bishop, so I will trade it off, even if it's for a couple kingside pawns. But this isn't the evaluating part of the game I wish to speak about, just an incidental part of how the game went. Looks like very poor prospects for black here, doesn't it.} e6 {Finally have a chess engine I can check accuracy of moves on, and according to Fritz, this is a very bad move. And Fritz is right. But stay tuned.} 7. g4 {I expected that. ;) Really did. And I had decided to take this position on. Learning from what the Grandmasters play is well and good of course; and I do that too. But sometimes I just like seeing the dynamics of positions that won't be found in theory.} Be4 {Fritz is still loving white. In this position, there are really only two choices that make sense. My opponent chooses the best move, as he has done most of the game so far...} 8. f3 Qh4+ {I love unbalanced positions like these. Things are being forced a certain way now; the white king must move Ke2, otherwise black gets an edge.} 9. Ke2 Bxf3+ 10. Nxf3 Qxg4 {Now this position in a regular long game I would not have allowed as black. But this is a Blitz 'for fun' game, and my opponent does not really think this position out, instead deciding to simply chase the queen with the h pawn. There were better moves, were it not a blitz game, that white could calculate out that would simply destroy black, and many of our stronger players here would find them in a blitz game as well.} 11. h3 Qh5 {Still an overwhelming advantage for white. What would you do in a blitz game here, where you aren't thinking the continuations all the way through? Perhaps develop a piece? That is what white chooses to do. He is thinking not incorrectly, that he wishes to get his king out of the pin. But he chooses a move that Fritz does not like much.} 12. Bg2 {This is the first real white mistake, because it gives me a tempo to do something besides allow my position to get worse and worse.} Ne7 {Still an overwhelming advantage for white.} 13. Kf1 {Now white has gotten away from the pin. } Nf5 {White knows he's winning, and has allowed his attention to stay around his King in an attempt to consolidate his advantage. In accordance with that idea, Ne2 would be a very good move for white in this position. However, for some inexplicable reason, white decides he has to do more to take the pressure off of his king, even if it means giving a little something back. In actuality, his king is not in as much danger as he thinks, as black does not have much firepower compared to the available white defenders. As a result, he makes a very poor move here on move 14, essentially equalizing the game for black.} 14. Nh2 {Talk about a blunder. You think you see it? Many of you might overlook it. Here is where our evaluation of a chess position must be as dynamic as the position is. Do you see that Ng3 might look tempting? And in the game it was. Most of you would first trade the queens. And so as could be expected, I did that.} Qxd1+ 15. Nxd1 {Here is the pivotal position of the game, and the one I alluded at the beginning of the game. White has a minor piece and a great center for two pawns. Look how inviting that g3 square is for the black knight. This is one of those positions, however, that without a lot of calculating, the right move should instantly be apparent, and it isn't Ng3. Consider the position. How valuable is that knight right now? Wouldn't it be apparent that it is easily more valuable than a white rook right now? Both white rooks are doing nothing. No white pieces are doing anything after white's move. The black knight right now is worth far more than the rook. Despite the temptation of the fork, I instinctively dismiss it and instead choose Nxd4, without looking more than a very few moves ahead. Fritz very much agrees. Nxd4 is the best move, and a distinct advantage, rather than Ng3+, forking the rook and king.} Nxd4 {I admit, I was rather proud, if such a word should be used, to have made the evaluation I made, and choose this continuation over the board in a Blitz game, as obvious as it might appear to our stronger players here. Material is even now, but with this move, black's position is far superior to white's. Had I traded the knight for the rook, I would have obtained a material plus, but no real advantage in my eyes. So when we evaluate a game, the dynamics and relative piece-worth of a position really help us decide as we also calculate what's really important because such things affect the actual piece value for what's on the board... or, in other words, a knight is only worth three points and a rook  five, when there are no other considerations. Before this move, that black knight was worth more than any white rook, and this is why.} 16. Bf4 Nd7 {White attempts to protect his pawns. Right now, the only counterplay he has is a pawn push on the queenside, which he does do in a bit. I have the luxury of nothing urgent to deal with, so continue with developing my other knight, threatening e5 and c5. The black knight has done it's work, fracturing white's plans to pieces. In this position, the white rooks remain worthless for a long time. With care, I think black should already have a won game.} 17. Nf3 {The best move for white, but now black begins to gain an advantage that won't be relinquished. That white knight - in my eyes - is worth more than the white rooks. And it could give white counterplay. So I take it off the board.} Nxf3 18. Bxf3 Bxe5 {Despite how useful that black dark-squared bishop is, with so many black pawns on the board, I want the flexibility of the black knight  for it's ability to both attack and defend my pieces. So I take with the Bishop. Fritz also agreed with Bxe5, although taking with the knight was it's second choice.} 19. Bxe5 Nxe5 {White could resign here, but my opponent never quits until it really is hopeless. So the game goes on another 30 moves.} 20. Kg2 Nd3 {I am trying to get out of the way of my own pawns. I have no grandiose ideas of winning the b pawn or anything else here. And I don't retreat the knight behind the pawns. I want to maintain some tactical threats down here if I can, just to hinder white while I push those central pawns.} 21. b4 {A clever move. The b pawn is immune to the black knight because of the white rook incursion that could soon follow.  I don't want to take that pawn and possibly the a pawn in exchange for losing my own b pawn, and allowing white counterplay. Note that black still has not castled, and using a tempo to do so with a white incursion going on would not be ideal! In this game, I never castle; there are not enough threats on the board to warrant the usual protecting the king, and soon those central pawns will become a major headache, supported by the black king. SO it is I who will restrict white, and push him until his back is against the wall!} Rb8 {Now the threat to the white b pawn is very real.} 22. Rb1 {And now it's not so real. ;)  I decide to ignore white's attempts for counterplay as much as I can, and continue now with the obvious black plan: the central pawn push.} e5 23. Nf2 {White cannot tolerate the black night. I view the rooks as impotent, and readily agree: I can't tolerate the white knight! I'd rather take away that defender from hindering the black pawn push than try to save the black knight. Besides, this way I keep a far greater 'tempo' or initiative going. Although the white bishop has greater scope, there are so many black pawns on the board that the bishop, with careful play, will remain ineffective, blocked at nearly every turn when things matter.} Nxf2 24. Kxf2 e4 25. Bg4 {As an aside, this was done intentionally by my opponent, but really just wastes time. I plan on f5 anyways, so this out of character move of my opponent was a little perplexing.} f5 26. Be2 {This is where the white bishop belonged, for any attempt at counter play on the queenside. But the valuable waste of the tempo by Bg4 just makes it harder to stop the pawns, no matter what path white chooses.} Ke7 {Although not one of the top two Fritz choices, in the game this move really blunts queenside counter play, and the king march behind the pawns proves too powerful for white to effectively stop. This is something that pays dividends too far ahead for Fritz to see clearly, an endgame weakness of computers. Well, programs are getting better all the time of course...} 27. a4 Ke6 28. a5 {Here my opponent chooses a move I would not have. I have no interest in opening the queenside, and so his effort now to create a position where I need not worry about the queenside just suits me fine. Well, he didn't want to have to worry about it either, because of the obvious tactics that would occur because of the lack of white king protection.} Ke5 {White really should resign. In fact, I start playing very lazily, because I know it's won for black. As such, I don't choose the best winning moves, and the game drags on another 20 moves.} 29. h4 f4 30. h5 g5 31. h6 f3 {I rather was not thinking for a bit here. Before the f3 push, it might have been better to reposition the rooks. White can try Bxf3 according to Fritz, but is still lost.} 32. Bf1 Rhg8 {Protecting the last important piece of the puzzle: the g pawn.} 33. Rh5 a6 {Tidying up the loose queenside before continuing.} 34. Bh3 {Here I did think a little. I knew what white was looking at. I decided I didn't care. I would let the g pawn fall to take a rook off the board and let him see if he could do anything with his h pawn. This was not the most accurate play by me, but I had made my decision; I thought that white would not have time to do much... and I am proven right.} Rbf8 35. Rg1 {The obvious. I was tired of this game now; I could have put my king on f6, maybe eventually g6 depending, but I knew how well my opponent could fight back. I just wanted to get pieces off the board.} Kd4 {Gauging my opponent's intentions. Had he checked me, I would probably have retreated and chose a different plan. But once he had decided on his own efforts, he pursued his original course of action.} 36. Rhxg5 Rxg5 37. Rxg5 {Repositioning the rook or an immediate e3 were best now for black.} Kc4 {This is a bit of a blunder, allowing white the opportunity to play Rf5. With the rooks off, the black h pawn would fall and the white h pawn would be a real threat. I really should have played better here. This was probably the last real white opportunity. } 38. Rg7 {Instead of Rf5, white chooses the obvious but incorrect Rg7.} Kxb4 {This is what a beginning chess player would do: grab pawns, instead of forcing the advantage home. What not to do! No excuse; I shut down my brain for a few moves, until I decided I needed to pay attention.} 39. Rxb7+ Kxc5 40. Rxh7 d4 {So I decided I better start playing seriously again. Never should have allowed that h pawn to even think of queening.} 41. Rg7 {Not the most correct move. The white pawn just won't be able to take those final two steps.} e3+ {e3! Well, no exclamation necessary. They need to invent a new notation for chess moves that are just obvious. White must be careful now not to misstep into a mate. Even though that will be unavoidable eventually.} 42. Kf1 {Oops. The evaluation now is more than -+26. Better was Ke1 or Kg1. Worst was Kg3. I choose the strongest continuation...} d3 {Now here we have the pawn steamroller, ready to crush anything in it's path... including a white king. Again, a comment. Material is 'even' supposedly. But anyone here I think would choose those three pawns over that one white bishop. And even in the midst of the tactics-filled middlegame, such opportunities exist in the imbalance of a position, to have a piece or pieces become worth much more than usual. Here it's obvious: those pawns might become queens. In the middle game, not so obvious, but watch for opportunities to pass up or give up the exchange for a different kind of winning advantage, such as what I chose on move 15, nearly 30 moves ago. Yeah, 30 moves ago. Those kind of decisions, when we get them right, really make a difference.} 43. Rg5+ Kb4 {Avoiding the white bishop, threatening the a pawn, and positioning for further supporting those central pawns. The best king move in this position. Often finding the best position is not always a matter of calculation (although that is most often a big part of it) as it is in getting the most out of one's piece each move.} 44. Bf5 {Although I don't see it yet, with this white move there is a forced mate now in no more than 15 moves; white is indeed lost.} d2 {And this move, which Fritz did not choose as any of it's top two moves (well, in less than five minutes of number crunching by it to be fair) leads to mate in at least 11 if not sooner. Over the board, I've seen the gist of the mate here a couple of moves ago, although I have not calculated it out. It's amazing to me the number of moves my opponent has made that was either the number one or two choice of Fritz. Here he makes the number two move; it's rather obvious anyways. Meanwhile, my rook stands stoicly by, enjoying it's long break from combat. } 45. Bc2 {Mate in seven now, if I play e2. During the game, e2 occured to me, after which e1Q follows. Very easy sequence there. But instead of choosing that, I move Rd8. I thought to force the white king away from the pawns, but overlooked the likely and actual Bd1.} Rd8 {Still a forced mate. But it's a while away. } 46. Rg4+ {The poor h pawn has not been able to move a step. Kc3 or Ka3 would be more direct now...} Kxa5 {I annoy my opponent. I don't need the king down there to win after all.} 47. Bd1 {White still fosters slim hopes of somehow ridding the black central pawns off the board along with both rooks, and queening. Hence this move, although it is to no avail. I choose the best move here...} e2+ 48. Bxe2 fxe2+ 49. Kxe2 {And my opponent resigns in this position, as he did not forsee the loss of his white rook. Yeah, it's not fun playing without a shred of hope unless one wants to see what the opponent does to finish the game. I've played a bit longer against good opponents than I should just to see how they finish me off. It's a learning experience, after all. I hope you enjoyed this game and got something out of it!}
