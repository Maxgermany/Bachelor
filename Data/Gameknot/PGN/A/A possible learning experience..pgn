1. e4 {A typical open, takes the center of the board and offers future development of the Queen and the Kings Bishop.} Nf6 {Not so typical, but a fairly common response. This was my move to both threaten the pawn and make an attempt at Center field control. You will find most of my early moves are set up around control of the center field, as I was taught that this is a key element.} 2. Nc3 {My opponent responds by covering his pawn with the Queens knight, thereby developing the knight as well.} e5 {Seeing my glaring error in my first move, I now advance Kings pawn to both take more center field control and to prevent an advance by my opponents pawn into my territory.} 3. Nf3 {This I was told was to 1) Threaten my pawn, 2) develop a second knight, and 3) begin opening the king side for possible castle later.} Nc6 {So many things to do, not enough time.. We need to develop pieces, to allow later use, while at the same time protecting the kings pawn from the obvious attack. I considered queens pawn here, but I have other plans for it. I considered kings bishop, but to use this would be to block my later advance of Queens pawn, so I used the queens knight, developing it and protecting the pawn.} 4. Bb5 {Comment: (bigglestw) Use of the kings bishop to threaten the enemy queens knight. The purpose of this is mainly to harrass the enemy, and to force them into making a move that they might perhaps rather not do just yet, which typically is moving the a7 pawn up to attack the bishop. This move has also developed the bishop, and has now cleared the way for a castle should it be desired. On another level, the enemy king is now starting to come under indirect threat. Moves like this can panic your opponent into making mistakes, simply because you are making decisive moves that are doing something positive. You are taking control of the situation, and forcing your opponent to react to your mvoes as opposed to the other way around.  (I ordinarily would agree %100 percent with his perceptions here. However, in this particular case i was considering the semi forced move next anyhow.)} a6 {Well, as my esteemed opponent pointed out, this was almost a forced move. However, my other option was to advance Queens pawn to d5, and i really was considering this move first. The only hitch is it would normally be followed by b7-b5, however his Bishop now resides on b5. We shall see how that ends up shortly!} 5. Bc4 {(bigglestw) The reasoning for moving the bishop here is to avoid it getting trapped. Had I moved it to a4, then I ran the risk of b7 - b5 which would attack the bishop again, and force it back down to b3. That becomes a little tight in that corner, so by moving it to c4, I can use the space I have available to me to maneuver. I can be attacked by a pawn to d5, but at least in this case, I have a greater scope of escape for the bishop. (Adui) The expected response, now how best to use it against him?} d6 {I see no immediate way to use his bishop move against him without developing at least one other structure first. So I move to an obvious attempt to bolster my pawns defense at e5, by placing Queens pawn on e6. Other moves considered were Pe5, Pb5, Na5, and Rb8, for various reasons involved in attacking his bishop, or mounting further defensive positions. } 6. Ng5 {(bigglestw) knight to g5. This now threatens the immediate area surrounding the opposing king. Not only that, but the pawn on f7 is being attacked by the bishop as well. This focuses on having more attacking than defending. Were the pawn to be taken, there is nothing to stop the attacking piece just yet. If the bishop took the pawn, that would be check, with no real option to do anything other than move the king out of check, which in turn would block something else off. If the knight were to make the attack, then that would allow a later move to either take the queen or the rook. When it comes to a situation of which to take, it is best to remember which is tactically better to be taken with as little loss as possible. For Example, if it came to the bit, yes, the queen could be taken at the loss of the knight. However, the rook could be taken for essentially free. We shall have to see what my opponent does in response to this before we can speculate any further. (Adui) A brilliant thrust that I overlooked in my last move! Bravo my friend!} Be6 {Well, Obviously I missed an important possibility for him. Now I am forced to choose from several basically defensive moves to prevent the possible loss of my Queen and or Rook. As my opponent points out, a knight attack on f7 would be disastrous for me, as I cant even take the knight with my king, so I would definitely lose at least one piece. This maneuver may still result in forfeiture of the castling ability, but at the very least allows me to prevent the loss of my queen or rook to his attack. I considered advancing my Queens pawn, but it would be moving into a three pronged attack with only two pieces backing it up.} 7. Qe2 {(bigglestw) Here we are again, with things being a case of 2 defense, 2 attack on his bishop on e6. However, he also has 1 attack, no defense on my own. In this case, I believe I can get away with holding my ground with the other pieces, and use this as a perfect opportunity to develop my queen, as this was in my plan to begin with. In some cases, it can be hard to tell who is playing to who's plan, and it is vital to keep yours as fluid as possible. Otherwise you run the risk of getting tied in to something that is no longer appropriate. (Adui) Hmmm, under the circumstances, I believe I may have gone on the attack here, with an Bxe6 attack. My obvious answer is Pxe6, which would be followed by his Nxe6 giving him a two for one trade, and a tactical edge with my queen threatened, and the possibility my move dependent of Nxc7  with my rook threatened.} Qe7 {I originally was going to advance my other bishop to clear the way for a king side castle, but the precarious position my king side defense is in made me re-evaluate. This both doubles the coverage on f7 and e6, and opens up a possible Queen side castle.} 8. Nd5 {(Bigglestw)The reasoning behind this move it a little skewed. There are other moves that I could have made, but they would have given away the initiative to my opponent. As I said earlier in the game, it is better to have your opponent reacting to your moves, rather than you reacting to his. This move by the knight is a highly risky one, and could feasibly turn the centre of the board into a blood-bath. The knight attacks the enemy queen, necessitating either the queen moving, or the threat destroyed. There are 2 options available in taking the knight. There is the knight on f6 and the bishop on e6. The knight on d5 is protected by the pawn on e4 and the bishop on c4, so in the long run, white would technically come out of the exchange with a better position.   (Adui) Im not doing so well this game, I keep overlooking little things like this.. } Qd7 {Hmmm, why did I not put here there to begin with? Ahh well. I tend to play a bit more defensively when playing black. Therefore I chose to move my queen out of harms way rather than initiating what my opponent so accurately described as a blood bath. I really had no other viable moves to review, so it was this or the knight takes knight and battle begins.. In retrospect, I see I could have offered a queen-swap that I may have come out on top over, but I wasn't sure of that and got side tracked, then did this without reevaluating. I really need to stop doing that!} 9. Qf3 {(bigglestw) By putting my queen here, I am increasing the pressure on blacks defensive position in the centre. It is becoming a very tight game, with both players trying to make sure they aren't the first to lose pieces. What I have now created is a 2 vs 1 attack on the knight at f6. What happens now is up to my opponent. You can see how I try to use that simple rule as much as possible when I begin to plan an attack. (Adui) This is perhaps the finest game my friend Biggles has ever played me, and I am finding it VERY difficult to counter him successfully. You may take this one my friend!} Nd4 {Again my opponent pressures me to take, and lose pieces. Again, I chose a move to pressure him to withdraw, as my holdings would come out on the losing side of an engagement currently. (I define it a loss unless I take more in trade than I lose, the current scenario makes it at best an even trade if I make the first attack) } 10. Nxf6+ {(Bigglestw)It is true that my queen has now been threatened, however, I have kept my advantage over the knight at f6, and can now carry out my attack. By moving my knight in, I not only complete the check, but I also threaten the queen (Didn't see this originally). This forces my opponent to take the knight, or lose the queen. At this point, I am happy to lose the knight, as I know that I can bring in my queen to provide a very strong attacking force. I run the risk later of losing my rook as a result of his knight moving in to check me, but I will have the option with my queen to take his rook, and then rampage through his lines.  (Adui) An interesting thrust that I miss the significance of till later.} gxf6 {A forced move} 11. Qxf6 {Should have been expected, I have fallen victim to a well thought out trap it seems.} Rg8 { It would appear I have allowed myself to be drawn into a well lain trap.  Another pretty much forced move here. Save the rook attack later.} 12. Bd5 {(bigglestw) By pushing the bishop up to d5, it brings it under the protection of the pawn at e4 and also allows me a point of entry at b7, which puts pressure on the rook at a8. (Adui)Getting cramped here. } Nxc2+ {This move is design to take advantage of the check gets a rook advantage here, and to take some focus off the center board so I can hopefully get out of the bind I am in..} 13. Kf1 {(bigglestw) This was always going to happen, t was just a question of when. I will let him have his fun taking my rook, and concentrate on how best to disrupt his defenses some more in order to gain a greater advantage (Adui) his first real mistake! by moving his king to that place, he boxes in his rook, making it that much harder to get it into play. I would have played Ke2} Nxa1 {Completes the attack} 14. Bxb7 {(bigglestw) This is a direct threat on the a8 rook. Depending on where this is moved to will determine my next move. The wrong place will lose more pieces, otherwise the bishop may just return to where it was having completed a successful strike.} Rb8 {Another pretty muched forced move, his move destroyed my castling ability.} 15. Bxa6 {(bigglestw) This has left the pawn open to an easy take, essentially for nothing. Now the left hand side of the board is free (from a white perspective)} Nc2 {Bringing my knight out for his next planned caper. If all goes well, (which it probably won't) I predict checkmate in 4 moves, plus whatever I need to dodge his attacks on my left.} 16. d3 {(bigglestw) The pawn will allow me to bring my bishop that is sitting on a6 back into play in the centre of the board. It also provides a limited protection against a checking move from the bishop on e6. My trap is being set, and it almost poised to spring. (Yes, I got a little excited over the past couple of moves, and let one or two things go unchecked. I hope I can recover the initiative again.) (Adui) Well played, it could spell disaster for my plan!} Nd4 {Well this is now a gamble. This move brings my knight back down the board a bit, and carries thru with his part in my diabolical plan.  Depending on what my esteemed opponent does next, victory or disaster awaits me!} 17. g3 {It would appear my opponent smells my trap, and is being wary. This gives his king running room should I check his back row.} Qc6 {This move puts my queen in a better position to attack, threatening both unprotected bishops.} 18. Bc4 {This limits it to 1 bishop that is now protected by a pawn. With any luck, I can still get my opponent to make a move that is less than desirable on his part, even though he will think it is the correct move.} Rg6 {My "Checkmate in 4 moves" prediction was thwarted by a variation my opponent saw and I didn't. (I really expected this to be honest, I was being hopeful that he would slip.) I choose this move to hopefully chase his Queen out of my very embattled corner, before I slip and give him a check plus take my pieces advantage. Upon closer inspection, it would seem I have given his queen no safe moves, (Well there is one) so I fully expect to lose my rook.} 19. Qxf7+ {Seeing his queens dilemma my opponent attacks. I personally would have taken the rook instead, However following this through the next few moves, i see where I make my next mistake already.} Bxf7 {This seemed like a good move at the time. However, after reviewing my opponents last move and comments in game, I see my colossal blunder will cost me a rook AND a bishop if Biggles does what I would do next.} 20. Bxf7+ {(BigglesTW)Certainly, the Bishop is gone. The rook, I shall see how you play it, and take it from there.} Kd8 {Seemed like a good place at the time.} 21. Nxh7 {Well, he wants my pieces without paying for them.. Not happening, Im going to get one or the other anyhow, and now I keep my rook!} Rg7 22. Bg5+ {(bigglestw) Technically, you don't really get to save your rook. One way or another, it'll go. (Adui) This appears to be a case of tunnel vision, he forgot about my bishop being able to block his check! Lets see if he sacrifices it or saves it and gives the other (two)} Be7 23. Bd5 {(bigglestw) That was another perfect example of getting carried away, and not reading the board. It is so easy for it to happen to any player, at any time. It is the worlds hardest thing to do, not make a sudden decision just because it seems right. Again, I have a feeling I have thrown this game away after playing so well throughout. (Adui) Well my opponent seems to have found a way out of the pit he fell in, lets see if i can stop being victim to his observation here.  	} Qc2 {And here I attempt to save myself from the same sort of blunder that nearly cost Biggles. Not reviewing the whole picture well enough!} 24. Bb3 {(bigglestw) Queen chasing. It is the games favourite past-time. It keeps my opponent thinking about how to save his queen, and stops him (hopefully) thinking about the rest of the board. Of course, he may just give up his queen for positional play, as I did, but then again, maybe not. We shall see. (Adui) An interesting philosophy; lets hope i dont make that mistake!} Qxb2 {Saves my queen and (hopefully) gives me a good position for her.} 25. Kg2 {(bigglestw) I've had that rook sitting there the whole game. Its about time I dug it out, and put it to work. Its more use to me doing something rather than sitting there. (Adui) And as has been typical this whole game, he makes the one move that ends my checkmate strategy of Rf7 then Qxf2#. } Rxh7 {So now I am going to stop trying to end the game quickly and whittle his army down a bit before I blunder into HIS checkmate plot.} 26. h4 {(bigglestw) wait, I have a checkmate plot? :P Having pretty much figured that it will take a stroke of genius and lots and lots of luck to pull a win out of this now, I've decided to take down as much as possible, and make life as uncomfortable as I can for my opponent. This pawn move bolsters my bishop's defense a bit, and also gives things more space to do stuff before it all gets taken. Adui) Not a bad move, a bit defensive but not bad.} Nxb3 {(adui) Well that bishop has been a thorn for a while, so I'm going to sacrifice the knight and eliminate the Bishop. } 27. axb3 {Expected response, and OK I suppose.} Bxg5 28. b4 {He does NOT fall into the trap..} Be3 {This is to get that pawn covered so I can Check him next move with Qxf2. Of course, if he covers the pawn I will have to regroup but I already have an idea for that.} 29. Kf3 {Well, My opinion this was not his best move.  I would likely have moved my rook to e1.} Qxf2+ {He has one move here, if I get lucky I can mate him in two more.} 30. Kg4 Kd7 {He makes his only move, I move my king up to allow for the Rook to come play} 31. Rc1 {This surprised me, I don't think he saw the reality of the danger his king was in. Not to mention the fact that my Bishop covers that square.  I Could be wrong but I would have played Kh3 here.} Bxc1 {Probably unnecessary, but I didn't like the possibilities that rook had for me. Since its free piece and only one wasted move, I took it.} 32. h5 Rg8+ 33. Kh4 Bg5+ 34. Kh3 Bf4 35. d4 Qxg3# {The rest was basic cat and mouse, me moving in for the kill, him trying unsuccessfully to stop me}
