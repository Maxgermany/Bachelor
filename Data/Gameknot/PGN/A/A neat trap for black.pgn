1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {A very common opening move.} Nc6 3. Nf3 Nd4 {Try this if you are sure you are not playing someone who would be suspicious of a trap.} 4. Nxe5 {White takes the poisoned pawn.} Qg5 {Queen comes to feint an attack on the knight.} 5. Nxf7 {White think they have a fork.} Qxg2 {Black starts to make trouble.} 6. Rf1 Qxe4+ {End game.} 7. Be2 {White has nothing to offer.} Nf3# {Sweet. Good to use on kids learning the game to make them aware at all times of traps and a good lesson to never take the poisoned pawn. Do not feel the need to leave negative comments. xx}
