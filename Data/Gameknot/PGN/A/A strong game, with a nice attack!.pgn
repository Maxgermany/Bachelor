[Opening "King's Indian (E70), 4.e4"]

1. d4 {I am starting with d4. I like that kind of games. } Nf6 {Nf6 the most popular move.} 2. c4 {c4 follows. I do not like Nf3 right now.} g6 {And g6 the second most popular after e6. As black i play e6.} 3. Nc3 {Nc3 is logical. And now we will play the Kings Indian Defence or the Gruenfeld Defence.} Bg7 {And here is the Kings Indian Defence, an open that i dont like that much playing against it.} 4. e4 {e4 continuing the main line.} c5 {And then c5. That not usual reply here and i was quite surprised as i found it unexpected. Here d6 or 0-0 were the main replies.} 5. d5 {So my d5 here is logical. What do you think?} d6 {So d6 here.} 6. Nf3 {Nf3 is the best move here continuing the delopment.} Bg4 {Another unexpected move here i think. Maybe better was 0-0.} 7. Be2 {Be2 is a fine move, unpinning the queen too.} Qb6 {And Qb6 gets us out any theory i guess (according to my knowledge).} 8. O-O {0-0 is fine here, maybe Qc2 or Bf4 would be fine too.} Nbd7 {Flexible move, helps the f6 square, pressing on e5 and also maybe he'll play 0-0-0 later (who knows).} 9. Na4 {Maybe that was a blunder, i do not know, what do you think? Qc2 may be better or Bg5??} Qc7 {He puts it back.} 10. h3 {h3 , i wanted to get rid of his bishop on g4.} Bxf3 {Takes it.} 11. Bxf3 {Take it too.} O-O {And 0-0. At least he didnt play 0-0-0.} 12. Re1 {The pawns on the centre are closed but i wanted to pressure on the e-file.} a6 {A blunder for me, maybe Ne5 is better here.} 13. Nc3 {I move it back to help the e4 pawn after a forecoming Ne5.} Ne5 {And so the predictable Ne5.} 14. Be2 {And Bishop back to e2. He has a good position and a flexible defence. He may pressure the d and e files with his rooks.} h5 {I think thats a mistake, weakens his kings side defence.} 15. f4 {f4 is good here, threatens his knight and his only square is one d7.} Ned7 {So he played it.} 16. Bd3 {It may look like a waste of time, but i wanted to place my Queen on f3, and at tha same time it protects both c4 and e4.} Rfe8 {Logical move.} 17. Bd2 {Be3 would be an akward move as its blocking the rook's power. A waiting move that helps the rook to connect and after Qf3 i think my position would be fine.} b6 {b6 is silly and waste of time. He loses tempo without a reason. Maybe e6 is better, what do you think?} 18. Qf3 {Good move.} a5 {Another waste of time.} 19. Re2 {Organize my attack step by step.} e6 {After b6 and a5 i think is too late.} 20. Rae1 {Now my rooks are well placed.} e5 {e5. Maybe Re7 is better. Now the plan is quite simple and has two parts: First isolate his queen and get her out of the game and then attack on his king.} 21. Nb5 {So Nb5 finishes the first part. The only move is Qb8, an it will be really outplaced there. Any another reply loses the d6 pawn and then the whole centre collapses.} Qb8 {So Qb8 otherwise Nxd6 and then a whole attack will come.} 22. f5 {I wouldnt take on e5 for any reason and f5 is the beginning of the attack that follows.} Kf8 {He realises that his King is isolated on g8 and also h5 weakened his king side. Now the only fact is if he's going to escape or not. If he manages to go on d8 then my plans have to change direction. So i found out that the only winning move here g4!, a move that doenst let him espape.} 23. g4 {So g4!} Ke7 {He's trying to escape but he didnt calculate correctly.} 24. g5 {g5! Now i have a clear advantage of the position.} Nh7 {Nh7 is not helping his defence.} 25. f6+ {f6+! A strong move, and he has not many choices.} Bxf6 {He takes it.} 26. gxf6+ {I take it.} Ndxf6 {The attack is not finished yet.} 27. Rf1 {Rf1 is correct and not Rf2 here.} g5 {g5 is not doing much.} 28. Bxg5 {The best move here to break his defence.} Nxg5 {He takes it.} 29. Qxf6+ {Now his knight is gone.} Kf8 {Either Kd7 is bad.} 30. Qh6+ {Taking his knight with check.} Ke7 {Ke7 or Kg8 alternatively.} 31. Qxg5+ {Another check} Kd7 {Kd7} 32. Rxf7+ {And the final hit with the rook. He resigned after that, a reasonable decision i guess. So i hope you like the game and my annotation is fearly good. Please feel free to comment and rate. Through comment and advices i am improving my game step by step. Have good games and luck! Bye bye!}
