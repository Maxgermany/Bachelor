1. e4 {This game is me vs my father on the chessclub. I was very lucky in this game. My dad could have won a lot of different ways, but he didn't. When I play chess against my dad at home, whether its blitz or not, I mostly win. Even this time, but with a lot of luck.   I start with e4, thats how I mostly start.} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe6+ {These move are played within a minute.  Because I like playing f4 after 0-0, (I learned f4 on gameknot) I used the knight to block the check.} 4. Nge2 Nc6 5. d3 {getting my bishop out} Nd4 {This is a wasted move. I told him so when we analysed.} 6. Be3 Nf5 {See? lost a tempo.} 7. g3 {Note black can do Nxe3 already. But we both didn't see it just yet. I did g3 to get my bishop out.} Nf6 8. Bg2 {I still didn't see Nxe3.} Nxe3 {But he does. } 9. fxe3 Qxe3 {black wins a pawn and has a queen on e3! seems very serious. White has deployed his pieces a little more though.} 10. Qd2 {I had to get his queen out of there right now.} Qxd2+ 11. Kxd2 {I cannot castle anymore.} e6 {For getting his bishop out.} 12. Rad1 Bd6 13. Kc1 {And look, I've castled long! :P} O-O 14. Bf3 {This was because I thought Ng4 is a thread} c6 {He did this to save b7 (he wanted to move his white bishop) I dont know if I would have done that. Getting the b-file for a pawn isn't such a bad deal. Rb8 is also possible.} 15. h4 {Well, my idea was to push my g and h pawns forward to destroy the kingside pawns and win the game. } Re8 {Why Re8? Because I think a lot of chess players play Re1/Rd8 after castle-kingside of Rd1/Re8 after castle queen-side. D & E files are important files in the game.} 16. g4 {Pushing my pawns forward to continue the idea} Kf8 {I think this is just a wasted move.} 17. Ne4 {black had two choices; taking my knight, and having my bishop on e4 having a good thread on the pawns, or Be7, having a good knight on e4.   } Nxe4 18. Bxe4 g6 {trying to back off my pawns.} 19. Rdf1 {This was for f5. after f5, black cant hit with his f-pawn.} Ke7 {Creating more space for the rook, and it is needed. But I don't know if it is worth two moves (kf8 & Ke7)} 20. h5 {If he hits, Rxh5 if he plays g5 then Bxh7} e5 {Threathening my pawn on g4. I forgot all about that.} 21. Rfg1 {protecting the g pawn} Bc5 {threathening my rook and Be3 } 22. Rg2 {If I played Rg3, it would probably go like Bf2.} Rh8 {protecting the pawns. If you look at this first, you can see that this is maybe just a move to protect the pawns  If you look at it at the second time, you can see that black loses a pawn} 23. hxg6 fxg6 24. Bxg6 {See? If hxg6, Rxh8.} Be3+ {A very important move.} 25. Kb1 Be6 {Connecting the rooks. I should've played b3 or c3.} 26. Rxh7+ {a blunder.} Rxh7 27. Bxh7 Rh8 {Now look at this. If I move my bishop its Rh1 mate.} 28. Rh2 {Protecting the bishop. I don't have any other option} Bxg4 {attacking my knight.} 29. c3 {creating more space for my king. If Bxe2, Rxe2 and it would be just a trade. But the next move is absolutely winnable for black;} Bf5 {White is powerless} 30. Rh5 {A useless idea to attack the bishop or the pawn (and after taking the pawn the black bishop) but I dont have any choice. Black is gonna win anyway. At least it was what I thought.} Bxd3+ {White's king is forced to move to a1. Rh1 is completely over.} 31. Ka1 {Now let's have a look at this. Black wins if he plays Bxe2 or Rxh7.    Ka1 Bxe2 Rxe5 ? Kd6 Rxe3 Rxh7 Can't get away of mate on h1  If Black plays Rxh7 then Black wins because he always wins a piece at least. (  he got a pawn more) } Kd6 {Now I can't even hit e5. } 32. Rh3 {I played this for the small hope black wouldn't hit my bishop because he would think its a trade. Which is obviously not.  But then something happened. Black picks up his black bishop on e3 and hits my bishop of h7! That move is absolutely illegal... And because of the rules on our chessclub, black is now forced to move that bishop! (because taking a piece and put it back on its place and picking up another piece is not allowed)} Bg5 {Well read the previous move why he did it.} 33. Rxd3+ Ke7 34. Be4 {The bishop prevents Rh1} Rg8 35. a3 {I should've done ths on move 25, 10 moves earlier.} Bh4 36. c4 {With the idea of Rb3, if b6 then Rxc6 if b5 then cxb5, cxb5 Rxb5} Rg4 {Forgot this one, but it doesn't matter. Black has lost a piece and the further moves are kind of unimportant} 37. Nc3 Bg5 38. Ka2 Rf4 39. Rh3 {Black gives up. I don't think I ever had so much luck as I did on this game.}
