1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  In the early part of the middlegame I got too tempted to leave my knight on a "strong" outpost that could be attacked by an enemy pawn.  Glenda inadvertently trapped her own steed by cutting off the only escape square it could have had.  This was brought home to me when Fou Lenoir was attacked.  I then decided that the best way out of this was to sac Fou Lenoir for two kingside pawns which left King Bookie rather draughty.  Can Glenda make amends and save the day?  If you do not wish to see the GA spoiler below you can just read on .......} Nf6 {1. .... Nf6 - a symmetrical response to Nf3 (Reti Opening).} 2. d3 {2. d3 - making e4 and c4 possible.} g6 3. e4 Bg7 4. Bg5 h6 5. Bh4 {5. Bh4 - maintaining a potential pin on the f3 knight should the e7 pawn move.} O-O 6. c3 c5 7. Nbd2 Nc6 8. Be2 {8. Be2 - development.} Nh5 9. O-O Nf4 10. Re1 Nxe2+ 11. Qxe2 {11. Qxe2 - Fou Leblanc is traded off for one of black's knights.} d6 12. Nc4 Bg4 13. Ne3 {13. Ne3 - an attempt to force a trade of minor pieces or to make the black light square bishop retreat.} Bxf3 14. Qxf3 {14. Qxf3 - black makes the trade.} Qd7 15. Nd5 {15. Nd5 - eyeing up a potential fork on f6.} b5 16. Rad1 Kh7 17. Qe3 {17. Qe3? - this is the move that will block off my knight's retreat.} g5 {17. ..... g5! Black exploits this and this move cleverly blocks off Fou Lenoir's defense of f6.  Now if Fou Lenoir moves to g3 then e6 makes my d5 knight into horsemeat!} 18. Bxg5 hxg5 19. Qxg5 {19. Qxg5 - a piece for 2 pawns down.  I will not hit the resign button yet as black's king is exposed.  I am therefore gonna go for the jugular.} f6 20. Qh5+ Bh6 21. Re3 {21. Re3 - a rook lift.  As the black bishop is pinned it is possible for me to swing the rook over to the kingside.} Qe8 22. Qh4 Rg8 23. Nc7 {23. Nc7 - fork.  Black tries to get out of it by threatening mate on g2 but my rook will then attack the BQ.  When she moves out of the way then the rook on a8 will be demolished by my knight's huge mace!} Qg6 24. Rg3 Qf7 25. Nxa8 Rxa8 26. Rh3 Qg7 27. Rg3 Qf7 28. Rh3 {28. Rh3 and DRAW OFFER of which my opponent accepts.  It is draw by perpetual threat - what a relief!}
