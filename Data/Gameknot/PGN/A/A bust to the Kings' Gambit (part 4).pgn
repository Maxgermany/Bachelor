1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6 4. Bc4 h6 5. d4 g5 6. O-O Bg7 7. c3 Nc6 8. Qb3 {we already learned in part I, that Qa4 is a much better option, after - let's say - Kf8 (d5 is a real killer), Bb5, Nge7 (what Fischer wanted earlier), Nbd2, and Black is in a lot of trouble: we will see this moves again...} Qe7 {the original - meanwhile corrected - analysis continues, 9. h4 Nf6 10. hxg5 hxg5 11. Nxg5 Nxd4!, and White loses... let's see, if there is room for any improvement...} 9. Bb5 {Fischer's 9. ... g4, and also Nf6, goes terribly wrong here due to d5; } a6 10. Bxc6+ bxc6 11. Nbd2 Nf6 {clearly not, what Fischer had in mind; he wanted Ne7...} 12. Qa4 Bd7 13. Qa5 g4 {finally, Fischers' g4 comes into play...} 14. Nh4 g3 15. h3 {and here it stops...} Ng4 16. Nc4 Qxh4 17. Qxc7 {seems, like White is taking over control...} Bf8 {pawn c5, needs to be covered...} 18. Nb6 Rd8 19. Rxf4 h5 20. Nxd7 Rxd7 21. Qxc6 Qe7 22. hxg4 Qh4 {certainly, not what Fischer must have meant...} 23. Rxf7 {Kxf7?, Qxd7+...} Be7 24. Be3 hxg4 25. Kf1 Kxf7 26. Qxd7 Qh1+ 27. Bg1 Rh2 28. Qf5+ {White has at least reached equality, in eternal checks...} Ke8 {forced...} 29. Qc8+ Kf7 30. Qc4+ Kf8 31. Qc8+ {not good is Qe2??, Bg5!, threatening, the lethal Be3...} Kf7 {}
