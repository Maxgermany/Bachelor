[Opening "Budapest defence declined (A51)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. d5 {This took me a little by surprise. I am experimenting difficultied "defending" the Budapest (my personal cruzade), but I face often dxe, that is not at all bad for white, despite some tricks he must be aware of. } Bc5 {A classic approach is to check, intentind to exchange the bishop, to "direct" white's developement and avoid surprises. Unfortunately black's developement is not so quick as it would be desirable, and this is the weak side of this defence. } 4. e3 {Better than e4, in my opinion, since black can try to find some sac on the black squares, eventually, like Bxf2+. } Ne4 {...Based on: f3, Qh5+ and g3 is not wise because of Nxg3. } 5. Qf3 {Good defence, I guess. Now I have to prove that the following is good for me... Ng5 gets a tempo, but the knight has no future on this square and will become a headache and more loss of tempo. So I tried...} Bb4+ {Whichever he interposes, N takes it. Then... the Unknown :-)} 6. Bd2 {Wonderful! I lose my good knight for a strong piece. for the engame!} Nxd2 7. Nxd2 O-O {Underestimating my lack of developement. } 8. a3 Be7 {Let's see if a bishop can be useful later. BxN kept me on the race for developement, with a white king in the middle of the board, but not easily attackable for black...} 9. Bd3 {I lost a race to occupy the white squares. I'll have to handle a kingside attack... I have to be careful. } d6 {With cool blood, knowing very well the attack I will be under soon.} 10. e4 {?? White locked the game, having the advantage (now lost!)} Nd7 {I am reborn. My problems are not solved, but I have resources now. } 11. Nb3 {Good, if you don't want to go for b4 at once, that would have been better, IMO.} b6 {This side is not really schielded, but it must be able to hold. c5 the key square. } 12. Ne2 {White seems not in a hurry to attack. Good for me. } Nc5 13. Nxc5 {White must have let me take the bishop, based on the fact that this lsb is completely useless for white. He would have had to check what after Na4.} bxc5 {a good column to fight for. } 14. O-O Rb8 15. Rab1 Ba6 {Better a5 before. My hurry, my fault. } 16. b3 {...and my attack is blocked, so I have to look elsewhere. } Bg5 {Intending vaguely Bd2 - but then?} 17. Rfd1 {My opponent must have feared something in this line, since played this to prevent it. } g6 {Now that white is not all that dangerous on the kingside, I can try a risky (as always) plan. } 18. g3 h5 {My lsb will return to the battlefield on a wonderful outpost. } 19. h4 Bh6 20. b4 {Of course. I knew that a bacteria that is not properly killed eventually returns, so here it is (no offence intended, I am referring to my failed attack on the queenside :-)} Bc8 {I have to be lucky if my opponent doesn't go for bxc, scrambling my pawns, but...} 21. b5 {...he didn't! It seems that white is happy with the "lock" and a drawn. } Bg4 22. Qg2 Qf6 {But now, look: white is almost with no moves and no possible plan! I am squeezing him, now...} 23. a4 Bf3 24. Qh2 {But, to be sincere, my position doesn't offer many libertes either. The only way to progress for black is to open the g column. OF course, it means to open my own's king position dangerously. I tried. } Kh8 25. a5 {White can bother me a little, but, with luck, I will get some tempoes from it, and I will be able to materialize my plan before white's attack on the queenside becomes really dangerous. } g5 {Rg8 was first, but I was a little nervous.} 26. hxg5 Bxg5 {Semi column opened, but now it must be occupied in an intelligent way, so to justify this way of taking the pawn back. The reason is this piece has to support... h4! or to be offered for sacrifice on e3. } 27. a6 {Thank you again, white. You think I cannot progress, but it is not true. } Rfg8 28. Kf1 Rg7 29. Qh3 Be3 {Nice little tactis here. White cannot take the bishop because of Bg4+, losing the queen. But black didn't accomplish such a big deal from this. } 30. Qh2 {Nothing but exchanges comes to me, so I have to go backwards. } Bg5 31. Ng1 {? Ok, white, thank you for showing me the way. I don't know which way is it, but I will trust you. } Bxd1 32. Rxd1 h4 {Shocking, isn't it? But in a move more, this will be very strong. } 33. Ne2 {Maybe white should have tried to refugee his king on the dead queenside... Ke2, Rmoves, Kd1, etc. } Rh7 {Now what, dear white?} 34. Qg2 {As good as any, I guess. This one prevents Qf3, thaw was one of black's agenda's moves. } hxg3 {MCTC} 35. Nxg3 {MCTC} Rg8 {Adding pressure and hiddens threats. } 36. Be2 {It is not easy to defend, but again, this is not the right strategy. The king must go to e1, to free the pawn for the knight's defence. } Bf4 {Overlooking the much better Be3!, threatening, if white goes Ke1, Bxf7+, Qxf7, QxQ+, KxQ, Rh2+, and if the white king goes to g1, RxB since the knight is pinned (!), and if Kf1, RxN. So it is a big think for white to try to defend from it. Of course the played move has its own threats (BxN!)} 37. Qf3 {A good way to defend, if you asked yourself if Bf4 was really deadly. } Rh3 {Adding pressure, just that, but without a concrete plan, I confess. Maybe Rh6, defending the queen, was better, but I wanted to crash in, not to provoke exchanges and go to an endgame. } 38. Kg2 {Incredibly enough, this seems to be a good move that reinforces white's position, and makes come into account the otherwise useless Rd1.} Qh4 {Unfortunately, my opponent resigned here. I can play with a possible following. The threat is BxN, and white cannot retake because of Rxg3+, winning the queen for a rook the least, OR, Rh2+, Kg1, BxN. White can try to add a defence to g3, and the best way seems to be Rd3, x-raying its own queen. It works, IMO. Would someone check, please? Qh5+, QxQ, BxQ, RxQ is not good for now, but is one of white's resource to release the pressure black has to be aware of. } 39. Rd3 {As far as I understand, it DOESN'T work. Let's see why. } Bxg3 {Anything but reatking is playable, but I can be wrong. } 40. fxg3 Rhxg3+ {I speculated with Rh2+ but, surprisingly, I couldn't find nothing more than to recover the piece with a pawn. Rg8xg6 I have to analyze yet. } 41. Qxg3 Rxg3+ 42. Rxg3 Qxe4+ 43. Kf2 {...and this should be a victory for black. }
