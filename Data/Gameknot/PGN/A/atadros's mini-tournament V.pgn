[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C78), Wing attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez Opening } a6 {Mostly I will meet 1e4 with 1...e6 as I know the French Defence quite well.} 4. Ba4 {A friend and team member suggested giving the Marshall a try as Black against this..... Thanks Jim)} Nf6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Be7 7. Re1 O-O 8. c3 d5 {Marshall Attack - Black sacrifices a pawn in return for a lead in development and good chances for a king-side attack.} 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxe5 {White accepts the offered pawn...} Nxe5 11. Rxe5 c6 12. d4 Bd6 13. Re1 Qh4 {Forcing g3 (h3 may be met with Bxh3!?)} 14. g3 Qh3 15. Qd3 {Not sure about this as it helps Black to build up the attack.... perhaps Nd2 was better.} Bf5 16. Qf3 Rfe8 {Seems logical to claim the e file (especially as white's Queen-side is so undeveloped) (Although, Shredder score it about even here)} 17. Qd1 {Position is lost after 17. Qd1, Maybe 17.Bd2 was best and equal according to Shredder?} Bg4 {Attacking the Queen....} 18. Rxe8+ {White exchanges his best developed piece.} Rxe8 19. Qf1 {A blunder but White is lost anyway... White defends aginst the threat of Bf3 but in doing so walks into another mate...} Qxf1+ {I take his Queen and he resigns..... (if 20. Kxf1 then Black wins with Bh3+, 21. Kg1 Re1 ++)  Thanks for looking...... enough encouragement for me to give the Marshall another try.}
