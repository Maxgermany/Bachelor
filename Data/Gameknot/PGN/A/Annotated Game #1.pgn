[Opening "Petrov (C42), Italian variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bc4 {This is my favorite opening to play. 3. Bc4 puts pressure on f7 pawn, which only the king defends. I also play this when black does 2... Nc6 just to be different and not do the Ruy Lopez that everyone expects when I reach for the bishop.} Nxe4 4. d3 Nc5 5. Nxe5 Be7 {??? At this point, he had lost the game. I had won his queen, and I offered to let him resign the game now, although he felt he could continue and at least try to get something done with the rest of the game.} 6. Nxf7 O-O {?? Castling is a good idea... as long as it doesn't result in a discovered check when I take 7. Nxd8. Four minutes on the clock.} 7. Nxd8+ Kh8 8. Nf7+ Kg8 9. Ne5+ Kh8 10. Qh5 {It's usually not a good idea to start moving your queen out on move 10, especially before castling, but I wanted to see if I could finish the game in the next ten moves and this was the easiest way I could see to do it. Three minutes on the clock.} g6 {?? Not only does this move does nothing useful, as I could just as easily respond 11. Qh6, but I could force a relatively fast mate after this. 2 Minutes on the clock.} 11. Nf7+ {I did this move to taunt him with the possibility of winning my queen, but knowing he couldn't. I'm mean that way. I later found out that at this point in the game I have a forced mate in 6 if he plays perfectly, which he didn't. } Kg7 {11...Rxf7 would have prolonged his imminent death at this point, but not for long - as I would respond Bxf7 winning two points.} 12. Qh6+ Kf6 13. Qh4+ Kf5 14. Qf4# {Checkmate with two minutes on the clock. Black had one minute. }
