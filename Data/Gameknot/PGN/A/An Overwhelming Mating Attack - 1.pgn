1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Most of my wins involving mating attacks have involved Class C or Class D players.  Just for once my opponent was just 30 points shy of being a fellow Class A Player at the start of our game.  Yet he resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate on move 21.  You are no doubt wondering, how in the heck did I manage to overcome passivitis in this game!  Well, read on.  This game starts as a 3 knights opening, the fireworks begin on move 4.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Bc5 4. Nxe5 {4. Nxe5 - first a black pawn on e5 drops.} Bxf2+ {4. ....... Bxf2+ - if NxN we get the fork trick with d4.  However, black decides to pseudo-sac his dsb on f2 and drawing Henry out in the open.} 5. Kxf2 Nxe5 {5. ....... Nxe5 - nacht.} 6. Be2 Qh4+ {6. ....... Qh4+ - aggressive stuff but I have a Witch Ejection Plan up my sleeve with 7.g3.} 7. g3 Qf6+ 8. Kg2 {8. Kg2 - Henry moves off the f file and I am one step away from castling by hand if I move my rook to f1 or e1.} c6 9. d4 {9. d4 - I decided to have a stab at the knight on e5 and open up a line for Fou Lenoir at the same time.} Ng6 10. Rf1 {10. Rf1 - now comes the Castle by Hand which also gains a tempo by harrassing the Witch.} Qe6 11. Bg4 Qe7 12. d5 Nf6 13. Bg5 {13. Bg5 - pin.} h6 14. Bxf6 gxf6 {14. ..... gxf6 - this B for N trade busts up black's kingside pawn structure, he must be careful.  I now play a move which I thought was a little chancy at the time but it worked out OK in the end - 15. d6.} 15. d6 Qd8 {15. ..... Qd8 - the Witch retreats to her home square and there she stays for the rest of the game.  That pawn on d6 reminds me of this game - http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/barmy-army-mini-tournament-pawn-stab?gm=18890 in which I went on to win.} 16. Qf3 Ne5 {16. ..... Ne5 - that move is very annoying, but I thought that I would have the beginnings of a mating attack by first putting Glenda on f4 and then doing a knight tour!  This little Tour de France involves Nd1-e3-f5 should black decide to castle kingside and defend his f6 pawn with his king.} 17. Qf4 Nxg4 18. Qxg4 {18. Qxg4 - that pesky knight swipes off Fou Leblanc.  However, it does mean that Glenda controls the g column.} b5 19. Qg7 {19. Qg7!! - this move is not only threatening the rook on h8.  If that rook drops then it's m8!} Rf8 {19. ..... Rf8 - the only move to avoid immediate mate.  However, black is in Old Matey's shadow and although he does not know it yet, there is no escape!} 20. Rxf6 Bb7 21. Raf1 {21. Raf1 - even if black manages to get the Witch off the back row and castle queenside, Old Matey will catch up with him on the back row thanks to the pawn on d6.  Black acknowledges this and waves the white flag and I found myself 9 rating points the richer - nice!}
