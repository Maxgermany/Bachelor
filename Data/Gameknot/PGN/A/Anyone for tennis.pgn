1. e4 {In my opinion, the hardest chess games to play, from the psychological standpoint, are those where you've already missed a clear-cut chance to win the game. You feel that you must win now in order to expunge the earlier mistake, but putting yourself under extra pressure only makes it easier to make further mistakes. I've chosen a tennis theme for this annotation because the 2010 Wimbledon Championships were played while the game was in progress, and this made me reflect on how the game was not unlike a tennis match, with "break points" being missed by both sides.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {I do vary my openings a little, but I'm most comfortable with good old ...Nc6, and that's especially what I'm most likely to play when my opponent's rating is lower than mine, as here.} 3. Bb5 {So it's going to be a Spanish Game. The next few moves are very well-known, so I won't comment on each one. In essence, it's a rally in which both sides are making sure the other never has the opportunity to grab the e-pawn, or at least, can't take much advantage by doing so.} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O {The main line is 7... d6 8. c3 0-0, but playing the moves in the other order keeps White on his toes, as he doesn't know whether Black intends to play the Marshall Gambit (8... d5). If White does think Black intends this, he may prefer to avoid this line with 8. a4 instead of c3. In this game, however, my opponent was not fooled by this little ruse, so we immediately return to normal lines.} 8. c3 d6 9. h3 {White plays this move to avoid ...Bg4. This is still the main line.} Bb7 {Zaitsev Variation. A logically motivated move, as the bishop is denied g4 and so seeks development on the other diagonal, putting pressure on White's currently underdefended pawn on e4. Of course, White can defend this pawn with d3, but usually he does not play this as it would slow down the intended d4 break.} 10. d4 Re8 11. Be3 {This seems a little strange. More common is 11. Nbd2, defending the targeted e4 square; d4 is already overprotected and the bishop is cutting the rook's defence of e4.} Bf8 {Since White's move doesn't seem to have any particular threat, I go ahead with the "book" move anyway. Though now that I come to analyse the game, perhaps 11... Na5 was a better response to White's unorthodoxy?} 12. Ng5 {White catches me wrong-footed and makes a deep drive into the back of my court. Now, 11. Ng5 is known to the book, but the normal response of ...Rf8 has been made impossible. I found out afterwards that I should simply have responded with 12... Re7, but I didn't think of this at the time.} d5 {Instead I borrow the idea of blocking the attack with ...d5 from the Two Knights Defence. This seems sound, as everything remains defended, but it does block the bishop and it does allow White to exchange off the whole centre if he chooses.} 13. Nd2 {White drops a point here, since after 13... h6 14. Nf3 the e4 pawn is no longer adequately defended. Best seems to take the exchange, although...} h6 14. Qf3 {...maybe White had this sacrifice in mind all along? Black's court is certainly about to come under intense pressure.} hxg5 15. Bxg5 Qd6 {Logical defensive strategy: get into the centre! Unpinning the knight is not sufficient to save the d5 pawn, but Black hopes to weather the storm and finish still a piece for two pawns up. To achieve this, Black's pieces must be activated. Black could also be more daring and play 15... dxe4 to avoid losing the pawn, but since this helps White bring his knight into play, I wasn't keen on the idea.} 16. exd5 Nd8 17. Qg3 {Naturally... White wants to exploit the potential pin on the g-pawn.} exd4 {That will keep White's knight off e4 for the moment, though the downside is opening a file that I immediately have to cede. It's a pity that my knight on d8 has no squares, since it keeps the rook out of play as well. Anyhow, White certainly won't want to exchange queens.} 18. Bf4 Rxe1+ 19. Rxe1 Qd7 20. Nf3 {White comes right up to the net to press the attack; he's not interested in recapturing on d4 or in taking the c7 pawn.} dxc3 {Let's make White prove that his attack is worth the material deficit....} 21. bxc3 Bxd5 22. Ne5 {White volleys...} Qf5 {...and Black's queen comes up to the net and smashes the ball past White. Translated into chess terms, I now felt confident I had seen off the attack, since various exchanges are threatened and the d8 knight is now free to come back into play.} 23. Bxd5 Nxd5 24. Bd2 {And White indeed retreats to avoid a further exchange...} Bd6 {...but this pin forces off another pair of pieces.} 25. Qh4 {Looking at this now, I can't remember why I didn't just play 25... Bxe5, winning a piece.} Qh7 26. Qg4 Bxe5 27. Rxe5 {At least I still get the exchange... but White has a threat of Re8#.} Nf6 {The threat is easily countered, but I still have to be careful...} 28. Bg5 {...since 28... Nxg4?? would be answered by the same move, Re8#. This is the game's first "break point"; do you see it?} Qg6 {I didn't either, and believe me, I was kicking myself when, very soon after, I noticed what I'd missed. After 28... Qb1+ there is no back rank mate and Black can take the queen!} 29. Qf3 {White now sees this and GETS OUT FAST!} Rb8 30. g4 {Still hoping for a kingside attack, perhaps? I was almost expecting White to play 30. Bxf6 Qxf6 31. Re8+ to pin my knight and make it difficult for me to activate my pieces, but presumably White felt he couldn't afford any further exchanges.} Ne6 {I naturally activate the knight and seal off the e-file. (And this seems as good a point as any to clarify the situation surrounding this game. After player "gringo67" timed out all six of his games, the group winner would depend entirely on the results of the games between the other three players, always a tense situation. I lost one to greg_johnstone, meaning that by the time only my two games with vladimir38 remained unfinished, I had to get 1.5 points from the two games to win the group. In the other game, I thought I had winning chances for a while, but my opponent successfully defused them and got a passed pawn, which I blockaded and then offered a draw on the grounds of opposite-coloured bishops. This was accepted, leaving this game as an absolute must-win.)} 31. Be3 Qd3 {I decide to make my queen more active and -- for now at least -- tie down White's bishop.} 32. g5 Nd7 33. Rd5 {White serves up a lovely ace that gets him right back in the match. Note that I can't save both pieces by 33... Qb1+ because after 34. Rd1 both are still attacked.} Qxc3 {So I choose to take c3 rather than a2, both because it's more central and because I'm defending c7 (and g7, for that matter).} 34. Rxd7 Rf8 {This passive placement of the rook now seems necessary to defend f7; I certainly don't want to move it and allow White to open up my king.} 35. h4 {Inevitable... White is still going for the attack, especially now that I have one fewer knight to defend with.} c5 {Nevertheless, I still decide to make White show me what he can do, and meanwhile advance my passed pawn to give him something to think about if his attack doesn't come off!} 36. Qg4 {White gets the queen back in position, pinning my g-pawn so that a pawn getting to h6 would be awkward...} Qc4 {...and I counter this with a volley from my own queen...} 37. Qg3 Qxa2 {...and drive the ball deep into the opposite corner of White's court. Now it looks as though White must succeed in his attack or else my pawns will give me an endgame win, but it's not as simple as that, this match has some distance to go yet!} 38. h5 c4 {I calmly advance the pawn; what else can I do? I want White to make the first move to the sixth rank so that I can block him...} 39. h6 g6 {...which I do. The disadvantage is, of course, that my long diagonal is now open and could prove a serious weakness. At least for now the knight covers the d4 square.} 40. Qe5 {White's thinking about the long diagonal too...} Qb1+ 41. Kg2 Qf5 {...but I knew that I had this means of getting back to defend, if White tried that.} 42. Qxf5 gxf5 {Now I felt I had excellent winning chances, with the queens off...} 43. Bd2 {...but White still isn't giving up! This move is clearly aiming to get onto the long diagonal...} Kh7 {...and this hasty sidestep is necessary to prevent 44. g6!} 44. Ra7 Nc5 {I move to defend the threatened a-pawn, but this turns out to be another blunder...} 45. Bb4 {...since although this pin doesn't win material, it does force my rook away from defending the f-pawn.} Rc8 46. f4 {Another break point missed! 46. Bxc5 Rxc5 47. Rxf7+ Kg6 48. Rg7+ Kh5 49. h7 wins.} Nd3 {Now I felt I had a fighting chance... White has actually helped me get my rook behind my furthest advanced pawn, and I'm willing to let the f7 pawn go. Overconfident, because in a few moves from now I'll allow White to play the exact same winning line again.} 47. Bd2 c3 {This move forces the issue...} 48. Rxf7+ Kg6 {...and I had a very sleepless night after playing this move! I'd only considered 49. Rg7+ Kh5 50. h7 cxd2 51. Rg8, when both sides promote and I keep the extra knight, but instead the simple decoy 49. Rg7+ Kh5 50. Bxc3!! wins on the spot.} 49. Rf6+ {White misses it!} Kh7 50. Rd6 {And, after neither of us has succeeded in winning a break point, this good move forces the exchange of minor pieces (at least, I can't see that Black has much alternative) thus taking the match to a tie-break.} cxd2 51. Rxd3 Rc4 {First point to Black. This is a more promising move than the more obvious ...Rc2, since the d-pawn is dead anyway, and the tempo gained on White's f-pawn allows Black to advance the pawns and get the roo} 52. Kf3 b4 53. Rxd2 b3 {Now material is level, and I was expecting that the game would probably be drawn. My outside passed pawn couple is nice, but my king can't get away to help them. However, it turns out...} 54. Ke3 Rb4 55. Rb2 a5 {...that the passed pawns are stronger than I realised! White can't move the king across to threaten them without letting the f-pawn go, but certainly if this pawn reaches a3 Black has won.} 56. Kd3 a4 57. Kc3 Rxf4 {Another point to Black. White will have to come up with a good serve now...} 58. Rg2 {...and this isn't it! Black was going to play Rg4 anyway, and this move doesn't prevent it!} Rg4 59. Rf2 Rxg5 60. Rf4 {This seems to be all White can do; if 60. Rh2 then 60... f4 61. Kb4 f3 62. Kxa4 Rg2 wins.} Kxh6 {Another point to Black. At first sight 60... Rg4 might seem superior as it keeps the connected pawn pair, but in fact the far-apart pawns give Black a stronger advantage. White's king can't easily keep both under control, and Black's king is close to the f-pawn.} 61. Rxa4 Rg3+ {Black doesn't want to let the b-pawn go if he can help it!} 62. Kb2 Kg5 {I wouldn't have thought it, but 62... Rd3 is actually the best move here, though the move played is not far behind. At any rate the intention behind the move played is clear, to support the advance of the pawn.} 63. Ra3 {White commits a fault with this move; there is no threat to win the b-pawn, since if he takes, Black exchanges rooks with an easy win. More enterprising is 63... Ra8.} Rg2+ {Black capitalises (though it's unnecessarily flashy; 63... f4 wins faster). White still can't take the b-pawn because of Rg3+. Match point.} 64. Kb1 b2 65. Rb3 f4 {A key move: Black advances the pawn before the king, so that if White exchanges on b2, the pawn is within range to promote unaided.} 66. Rxb2 {But White realises he now has no way to stop Black promoting one or other pawn, and gracefully makes a final exhibition shot, allowing Black to smash home the winner. What an exciting game it was!} Rxb2+ {}
