[Opening "Sicilian defence (B30)"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 g6 {The most flexible move against White's irreverent move order. The standard move is 3...e5, but it's too ugly for my taste. I should note that 3.Nc3 was played to avoid the Sveshnikov, so why not play the Dragon instead of a weaker version of aforementioned defense? } 4. d4 {Back to the open Sicilian.} cxd4 5. Nxd4 Bg7 6. Be3 {I should say that I don't usually play the Dragon, let alone the accelerated version, except against my opponents precise order of moves and for quite a few reasons. First of all, I avoid the Maroczy bind, since White has already played Nc3 and I also avoid the very critical lines with 9.0-0-0 in the main line of the Dragon, since not having played d6, I could play d5 in one go and save a very important tempo.} Nf6 7. Bc4 {A very active line for White and scoring quite well, but bellow the average Maroczy or 9.0-0-0 lines.} O-O 8. Bb3 {This is the main drawback of playing with Bc4. Because of the threat of Nxe4, White must waste another move to secure this Bishop.} a5 {9...d6 would have lead to a Yugoslav variation of the Dragon in case White would have replied with 10.f3} 9. O-O a4 {A very debated exchange of pawns. Black exchanges a side pawn for a central one, but in doing so weakens the Q-side and gives White some initiative. My opinion is that the position is roughly equal.} 10. Nxa4 Nxe4 11. Nb5 d6 {The most recommended move is 11...Ra6, but I feel that that just exposes the Rook unnecessarily. Another suggestion in this position is the exchange sacrifice 11...Rxa4.} 12. Qe2 {A more forcing line would have been 12.Bb6 Qd7 13.Re1 Nf6 14.Nc7 Rb8 15.Nc3 Qf5 16.Qd2 and White is slightly better, but Black has no real problems.} Nf6 {The theoretical move but maybe 12...Ra6 was worth considering} 13. c4 {After this, Black is out of the proverbial woods. 13.Nb6 was the only try for an advantage.} Bg4 {Asking White if he wants to misplace the Queen or weaken the a7-g1 diagonal.} 14. f3 {He chooses the latter.} Be6 15. Bb6 {This move has considerable less sting now.} Qd7 16. Bf2 Qd8 {Offering a discrete draw.} 17. Rfd1 {White doesn't want the draw.} Nd7 {No more tolerance for b6 infiltration.} 18. Rac1 Na5 {Highlighting the drawback of White's 13th move.} 19. Nd4 {A very natural move, but Black now gets the opportunity the seize the initiative.} Bxd4 {A risky decision but I wanted to win the game as well.} 20. Bxd4 b5 {The Bb3 is a real liability and White must now surrender a pawn.} 21. Nc3 {The Knight had no more prospects on a4.} bxc4 {Perhaps 21...Bxc4 was slightly better.} 22. Bc2 {22.Ba4 was more active.} Nc6 {Black's turn to rearrange his pieces.} 23. Be3 Nb4 {Not only has Black gained a pawn but he has the initiative as well.} 24. Bb1 {White must really love this Bishop if he's so adamant not to surrender it.} Ne5 {d3 here I come!} 25. a3 {Getting rid of the a2 weakness with tempo.} Nbd3 26. Bxd3 {After his long and difficult journey, the Bishop is finally put to sleep.} cxd3 {Again capturing with the piece was favorable. I must have thought I was going to queen this pawn.} 27. Qf2 Qd7 28. Bf4 Bc4 {Now I have to defend my weak pawn and White gets good chances to even the game.} 29. Qh4 {Black's King is without his trusted Bishop so White goes for the attack.} Rfc8 {The threat was Bxe5 and Qxc4.} 30. Ne4 {Going for a full blown assault.} Bb3 {Suddenly, I start having wild fantasies about queening my pawn again.} 31. Bh6 {A crude move but with a genuine threat, namely Nf6+.} Qa7+ {First getting rid of the potential fork and making White's first rank a little less secure.} 32. Kh1 f5 {Now to dismantle the illusory attack.} 33. Nf6+ {This just gives a piece for nothing.} exf6 34. Qxf6 d2 {Kamikaze style.} 35. Rxc8+ {35.Rxd2 is bad because of Rxc1 and 35.Bxd2 is also bad because of Nd3. Black's 13th move payed for itself in gold.} Rxc8 36. h3 {Tempting Black to err with the greedy 36...Bxd1, after which White completely turns the tables with 37.Qe6+ Nf7 38.Qxc8+ Nd8 39.Qxd8+ Kf7 40.Qxd6, White has taken all the material back and the d2 pawn is a goner because of glutton Bd1 that blocks his square with a belly full of Rook.} Re8 {Not allowing any more tricks.} 37. Rxd2 Nxf3 38. Rf2 Re1+ {With mate on the next move.}
