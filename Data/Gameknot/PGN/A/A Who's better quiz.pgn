1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 e6 4. Bg5 {A good and original (for me) answer to the Icelandic. Black can't play Nbd7 because of dxe. Black doesn't have to, but has to think about how to develop properly. } Qxd5 {I went for an experiment. It should be bad, but I plan to USE the g column. Let's see...} 5. Bxf6 gxf6 6. Nc3 Bb4 {The standard answer, with the surprising intention to take the N, then e5...} 7. Nge2 c5 {Let's take advantage and attack! It was not a plan, it was instinct. Generally speaking, often it comes out than to exploit pins is the way to break the opponent. I am well aware of Nb5, now...} 8. Qd3 c4 {Harassing the Q, based on the fact that white will better be cramped that favoured in his developement by a pawn's exchange. But I overlooked...} 9. Qg3 {Forking g7 and c7. Which is worse? What kind of play do I try to build around this "tragical" choice? Maybe, g7 is worst. Intuition. c7 is rounded by pieces. } Qg5 10. Qc7 O-O {!? True, castling on an opened column, but I bet white is in no position to exploit. } 11. f4 {Not the futile check Qh5+, but...} Qd5 {defending d4, that white overlooked or didn't want to take with the Q. } 12. O-O-O {Here, I blundered! A pity. I "forgot" that the N was not pinned anymore, and played...} Na6 {A fanastic move, since the WQ is trapped, if not for... :-)} 13. Nxd5 Nxc7 {NO choice. } 14. Nxc7 Rb8 15. g3 {"Well done". How can I save this game? Nevertheless, the position is still very rich of nuances. } a6 {It cames out that I will play for trapping the WN. } 16. d5 {Smelling the danger. He has no B to support d8, so I bet I will be able to stop it. } b5 {Solidifying the trap. If d6, Ba5... I'm in danger!} 17. dxe6 fxe6 {Now, WN is trapped. How will he get out of this one? It wil cost me two tempos!} 18. Bg2 {Ok. } Ba5 {One. } 19. Nxa6 {...of course. better to dye for something. But better was the e pawn. Black could have thought that the following move will compensate. } Bxa6 20. Rd6 {A good plan. } Rb6 {The only defence. } 21. Rhd1 Rfb8 {Again, the only defence. I'm really hanging...} 22. Rd6d7 {Good, trying to force me to leave him the 7th rank. } Bc8 {This is needed. I defend e6. } 23. Rd7d8+ {That's ok. } Kg7 24. Nd4 {White threats Nc6.} Ra6 {I was exploiting the discovered attack to the WR, coupled with a threat of Rxa2, but now was his turn to blunder. } 25. Nxe6+ {I don't need to retake with the B...} Rxe6 26. Bd5 {That's almost a mate net, but not comple. } Re1 {...and I force a R exchange. Not sure if good or not, but I knew I had to stand for a check. } 27. Rg8+ Kh6 28. c3 {Now, I have a bishop, but white has pawns. My R is pinned. My advantage is almost a disadvantage! :-)} Rxd1+ 29. Kxd1 {Unfortunately, there was no way to threat Bg4+ (for RxR), because te R would be the B's killer. } Bc7 {Step one: unpin my lsb. } 30. Kd2 Bf5 {Get a strong position, and forcing white to exchange the rook. } 31. Rxb8 Bxb8 32. Bf3 {? Overlooks Bc6, winning a pawn. Me too. } Kg6 {I was thinking in managing his pawns. } 33. a3 {So to prevent b4. } h5 {...so to prevent g4! I felt very released, forgetting that...} 34. Bc6 {Oh, My, the last blunder. } h4 {A sac to destroy his pawn's chain. This will be risky, but will cause him to worry. } 35. Bxb5 Bd3 {I can't lose this pawn, too!} 36. Ke3 Kh5 {I dreamed to go into... white squares. And my lsb's duty was pretty limited by then...} 37. Kf3 f5 {? I have to support my lsb... but it was a mistake, since...} 38. Be8+ Kh6 39. gxh4 {...and I can't retake. } Be4+ 40. Kg3 Bd3 {Now, dear reader: who's dead? Can black survive? } 41. Bc6 Ba7 42. Kf3 Bg1 43. h3 {I timeoutted here. I'm very sorry, so I annotate the game because it was very tense, despite the blunders. }
