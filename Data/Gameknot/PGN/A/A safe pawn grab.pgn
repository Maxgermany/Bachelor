[Opening "Sicilian (B52), Canal-Sokolsky attack, Sokolsky variation"]

1. e4 {Don't mind the conflicting title with the result, I think Black's pawn grab was pretty good and if he had played a little more cautious, he could have held on to the pawn with a good position. Instead he played a little passively and got himself in real trouble very fast.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {The only anti-Sicilian I consider worth playing. Ivanchuck used this line to end a non-losing streak of Kasparov's. The point of this move is to delay the central break and either exchange a pair of Bishops or force Black to develop his pieces on slightly awkward squares.} Bd7 {The most solid line. 3...Nd7 is more risky but offers more winning chances for Black, provided he survives the middlegame.} 4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {Again the most solid recapture. Black wants to develop the Nb8 to c6 to control d4. Capturing with the Queen has another point in case White tries the following setup.} 5. c4 {Aiming for an improved Maroczy bind. Since White has exchanged his light squared Bishop, he should be a little better if Black allows White to play d4.} Qg4 {A more radical approach against White's plan is 5...e5, which is solid albeit slightly passive. This Queen sortie wins a pawn but at a significant risk. White will get a lead in development, open the central lines and exert quite a bit of pressure. I'd also like to mention that Black gets adequate play in the main lines, so I think this will be my last outing with this line.} 6. O-O {The e-pawn is the pawn that must be sacrificed, since the e-file will provide good tactical chances against the uncastled King.} Qxe4 7. d4 {Another pawn was under attack so this was the only move to keep the initiative going.} cxd4 8. Re1 Qg4 9. h3 Qd7 10. Nxd4 {For his pawn, White gained a lead in development and a semi-open file bearing on the black monarch. But like in all gambits, he has to play actively or else he'll end up just a pawn short.} Nc6 {Contesting the centralized Knight. An interesting line here would have been 10...e5 11.Nc3 Be7 12.Ndb5 a6 13.Qa4 Nc6 14.Nd5 Rb8 15.Nb6 axb5 16.cxb5 Qc7 17.Be3, with a very complicated position.} 11. Nb5 {Avoiding any piece exchanges and threatening Nxd6+.} Rd8 {Slightly better was 11...e6, but after 12.Bf4 e5 13.Qd3 Nf6 14.Bg5 a6 15.N5c3 Be7 16.Na4! (the only move to keep the initiative going) Qe6 17.Nbc3 0-0 18.Nd5 Rab8 19.Nab6 and White has some pressure for the minus pawn.} 12. Bf4 {Attacking d6 once more.} e5 {If Black had played 12...e6 here, I would have replied with 13.c5 dxc5 14.Nc7+ Qxc7 15.Bxc7 Rxd1 16.Rxd1.} 13. Be3 {Now a7 is threatened.} b6 {Safer was 13...a6, now the Nb5 cannot be removed in good conditions because the Q-side pawns will be left very weak.} 14. Nb1c3 Nf6 {Since White didn't threaten anything, Black continues development hoping he will be able to castle to safety.} 15. Nd5 {Threatening Nc7+.} Nxd5 {Removing the over-active centralized Knight immediately but now after...} 16. cxd5 {Where does the Knight go?} Nb4 {I think 16...Ne7 was safer, even if it tangles the K-side pieces temporarily. Now White gets a tempo to bring the Queen into play.} 17. Qa4 {Protecting the Nb5 and tempting Black to grab another pawn.} Nxd5 {Virtually forced, the Knight doesn't have any other good retreat square.} 18. Rad1 {The pawn was saced to reopen the d-file and get more tempos into the attack. It also forces Black to exchange his only developed piece.} Nxe3 19. Rxe3 {The e5 pawn is again under attack.} f6 {A losing move. But even after the best move, White gets an edge. Here is a long winded but almost forced line 17...Nxd5  19... Be7 20.Nc7+ Kf8 21.Qxa7 (winning back some material but with tempo) Rc8 22.Rc3 Bd8 23.Rdc1 Kg8 (trying to connect the Rooks) 24.Qxb6 (winning back the second pawn) h5 (creating a breather for the King) 25.a4 (simply trying to Queen the passed pawn) d5 (Black tries the same) 26.Qb5 (now that material is even but White has positional advantage, he offers a Queen swap) Qxb5 (the only alternative is Rxc7, giving up the exchange since after...) 27.Nxb5 Rxc3 28.Rxc3 d4 29.Rc8 Black is in a miserable position.} 20. Rc3 {Now not only Nc7+ is threatened but Rc7 as well. } a6 21. Nc7+ Ke7 {21...Kf7 was better but after 22.Qc4+ Kg6 23.Rg3+ Kh5 24.Nd5, White's attack is crushing.} 22. Nd5+ Ke8 23. Qxa6 {Black resigned since there is no defense against Rc7.}
