1. e4 c5 {My favourite move to 1.e4 is now 1...c5.} 2. a3 {Unusual manoeuvre...} g6 {I try to control a1-h8 diagonal.} 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d4 {d4? } cxd4 {I take it!    Maybe it was an inattention.} 5. Qf3 {hahaha he tries to end the game at move 6.} Nf6 {IT'S TOO EARLY, MY DEAR!!} 6. Bg5 Bg7 7. Bf4 e6 8. g4 d5 {In Sicilian I often push d5.} 9. exd5 exd5 10. Bb5 Bxg4 11. Qg3 a6 {a6 is not a mistake but I could move Qa5  and I take the Bishop.} 12. Be2 Qe7 13. f3 Bf5 14. Kd2 {Move the uncastled king to protect a pawn when it can be protected with other moves, sounds like a mistake.....} Be4 {Be4! Maybe the ! is too much but it's a good trap.} 15. Nh3 Qd7 {Well, it's a bad tactic......I mean: maybe white thinks if he takes the bishop, the queen would take the pawn and then the Q is very close to the K (even if there's no possibility to attack him in that way), so I moved the Q........I know it's a li'l crazy, but, you know, I'm not Tal's son.} 16. Ng5 Qe7 {It didn't work...like I was afraid.} 17. Bd6 Qd7 18. Be5 Nh5 {Nh5! to attack Q and Bishop and protect my B.} 19. Bxg7 {B:g7??        Maybe it was an inattention.} Nxg3 20. fxe4 {f:e4?         Maybe it was an inattention.} Nxh1 21. Bxh8 O-O-O 22. Bf6 Re8 23. exd5 Rxe2+ {R:e2!?} 24. Kxe2 Qg4+ {This time the inattention is mine. I would take the N  ing the K, but I didn't see B} 25. Kd2 Qf4+ {Luckily.......I'm LUCKY!} 26. Kd3 Qxf6 27. Nxh7 Qf1+ 28. Ke4 Qf5# {Qf5#. My opponent is not new on this kind of mistakes [(except 19.B:g7) (see the first game against him)]. Maybe I would win without mistake on move 19......Anyway, thanks for reading and comment! Bye!}
