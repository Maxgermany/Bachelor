1. e4 {Me and my opponent, Mattcarr, play each other regularly both on Gameknot and with a proper board and pieces. Due to Mattcarr's greater experience playing, the games usually go his way (such as, out of the 10 games we have played on Gameknot, he was won 8 of those), but recently, due to my own abilities improving and some teaching/training that he gave me, some of those games have become harder for him to win and 2 have gone my way. On the morning of December 25th, we decided upon a Christmas Game. This is the result of that game, and how I approached the game, which includes many swap offs, and a little fierce battle for center control near the end.} e5 2. Nf3 {Here, I saw this layout and believed myself to be heading towards a Scotch opening. Though I like the Scotch personally when I'm playing as White, as Black I do not, as I believe it can give White an advantage having their Queen on D5. So I chose to counter, and take my Queen onto D5 instead by offering White the D file pawn.} d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Nc3 {The use of the knight of course forces my Queen to retreat or be lost. At this stage of the game, I was not willing to lose my Queen for a Knight, so I of course chose to retreat, allowing White to control the center squares from afar.} Qd6 5. d4 {Here I believe White to be offering his pawn for a later Queen exchange (exd4, 6. Qxd4 Qxd4, 7. Nxd4), but something I've learnt from my regular games with Mattcarr is that he won't offer a pawn without expecting to gain a greater reward a few moves in. So I chose not to take the bait, playing Nc6 instead to defend the e5 pawn and pose a faint attack on the d4 pawn.} Nc6 6. Bb5 a6 7. Bxc6+ {Here the first of only four checks in the game (including mate), a point piece swap off. My normal retaliation to this attack by Mattcarr is to take back with a pawn, which results in me having doubled up pawns. Today I had the Queen available to ensure the pawns didn't become doubled up unless absolutely necessary, which I did.} Qxc6 {This also allows for an attack on both Knights if I want to get reckless.} 8. Nxe5 {I don't understand this move. The Knight now poses a threat to the Black Queen, but the Queen has an obvious escape route to take the pawn back on G2, as well as further attacking Whites back ranks.} Qxg2 9. Qf3 {Black's attack of White's back ranks is stopped with offering Queen Ultimatum. Again, a common theme in the games between myself and Mattcarr is the offering of Queens early in the game. Here, I would rather like to keep my Queen in an attacking mode, however, any square my Queen goes on will result in its loss. G file is covered by White's Queen, black squared bishop and the Knight on e5. Taking the Rook results in a Queen loss for Black, as does taking either of the two pawns. Moving to h3 would only prolong the maneuver, as White is clearly happy to do a Queen exchange. So with retreat out of the option, I chose to take White's offer of Queen swap.} Qxf3 {White loses his Queen, Black goes 9 points up...} 10. Nxf3 {And back again with the immediate recapture.} Nf6 {I chose this move as I wished to begin developing my pieces, having lost the only two pieces I had developed. I chose the Knight above the Bishops because the Knight could be kept safer on the 6th rank. It gave me a chance to see Whites next move and allow me to plan from there.} 11. Bf4 {The bringing out of this Bishop made me consider a Bishop swap off with (Bd6, 12. Bxd6 cxd6) but I decided against it as the endgame may require more piece than just pawns, so I opted for attacking Whites Knight instead with Bg4.} Bg4 12. Ne5 {The Knight moves from danger, and immediately threatens the Bishop in return. A strong move, forcing me to either retreat the Bishop or do the swap off for a Knight that I hadn't wished to do.} Bh5 {I wanted to keep coverage of that diagonal, so chose to retreat the Bishop to safety on h5. This also stops Whites King from moving onto the d1 or e2 squares.} 13. O-O {This castle would prove to be fatal to White due to the lack of a King pawn defence due to my Queens earlier attack. However, White is now in the strong position of having connected Rooks, ready to launch an attack if he so wished.} O-O-O {In retaliation, I chose to castle Queen side, which put me one move away from connecting my own Rooks, in direct retaliation to White's castling.} 14. Be3 Bd6 {To finalise my moves of connecting my Rooks I moved my Bishop into an area attack Whites Knight. Luckily, my earlier choice of retreating the white squared Bishop to the H file provided defence to the f7 pawn. This helped as otherwise both my Rooks could be forked by Nxf7. Thankfully, I was able to attack the Knight without worry of this happening, or safe in the knowledge that if White did try it, I gained a free Knight out of it.} 15. Nc4 {The Knight retreats....} Bb4 {The Bishop follows, adding continued pressure to White to make decisions about his Knights.} 16. Ne5 {A swap appears to have been offered, however I wished to now remove the possibility of my Rooks being forked, so chose to move the h8 Rook to e8, allowing it to see further up the field towards the center of play.} Rhe8 {The e8 Rook can now easily attack, instead of being hidden behind pawns.} 17. a3 {White makes the message clear. Swap pieces, retreat, or lose the Bishop.} Bxc3 {The swap is taken.} 18. bxc3 {Though the swap is now complete and both players are points equal, White must now contend with doubled pawns, a weakness that Black could later target if they so chose.} Ne4 {I decided to move the Knight to attack the c3 pawn and place a little bit of pressure on White.} 19. c4 {The pawn moves to safety, naturally.} c5 {Now, I was hungry for a bit of action to occur on the board. I was preparing for the battle for center to begin by placing the attacking pawn on c5.} 20. Rfe1 {I don't know why White chose to move his Rook here. I can only assume that they didn't wish to do (dxc5) and give Black the open file for their Rooks. Either way, this to would prove costly very soon.} f6 {Upping the attack and pressure on White. I expected the response that followed.} 21. f3 {Naturally, place Black's Knight under the same pressure as White's. Now, if Black takes the Knight, White takes back and points and piece equal again. The advantage however would be Blacks, who would have access to the resultant open file first if they chose.} cxd4 {Time to begin the battle for the center. Black goes 1 up and White has no real option but to retreat the Bishop. If White takes back the pawn, then Rxd4, White goes 3 points down and loses their second Bishop.} 22. Bc1 {The Bishop sensible and dutifully retreats.} fxe5 {So Black takes advantage to go 4 points up and remove Whites last Knight.} 23. fxe4 {White responds with the obvious move to take Black's Knight. However this now creates the open F file, which Black can access first if they wish.} Rd6 {However, I saw an opportunity to place real pressure on White by checking the King, so chose to move a Rook up ready to go round the stationary pawns on g7 and h7.} 24. Rb1 {Another questionable move by White in my opinion. That Rook is at best joining the fight on the 6th rank, but the move to the B file itself does not assist White.} Rg6+ {So comes the Second check of the game. White has only 4 moves available here, being: Kh1 - response = Bf3# Kf1 - response = Rf1+ Kf2 - response = Rf1+ Bg5 - response = Rxg5+  White's days have suddenly become very short indeed.} 25. Kf2 Rf8+ {Black checks again. This now leaves White with only one move before the game is over anyhow.} 26. Bf4 {The only move available at this point, but White knows the game is over.} Rxf4# {Checkmate is issued and White loses the Christmas game. How this came about, I am still to ascertain, as the moves I made leading up to this would normally have been picked up and stopped long before by Mattcarr.  This was definately one of my stronger games against Mattcarr, both on Gameknot and offline.  Thanks for reading my annotations, I hope you enjoyed them, they are my first so any constructive critism is welcome. I tried to provide an insight into my moves and decisions though rather than provide a teaching or instructive insight. Happy Christmas.}
