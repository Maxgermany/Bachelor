1. d4 {Grdelica's rating of 1907 is probably high than my own.} Nf6 2. Bg5 Ne4 3. Bf4 g6 {Already I was a little uncomfortable out of the opening, since I thought it might be good for black if the position were to open.} 4. e3 Bg7 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Nbd2 c5 8. c3 {Eight moves in, the tension remains.  I would rather have black take cxd.} b6 {This move looked like it significantly weakened the long diagonal.  However, I could see no practical ways of exploiting the possible weakness.} 9. Qe2 Bb7 10. O-O d6 {My idea here is to weaken black on the light squares.} 11. h3 Nbd7 12. Rac1 Rc8 13. Bg5 {I considered the bishop not very good in f4, while black has a useful knight.} Qc7 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. Rfd1 {I played this move after a lot of consideration.  I have consolidated my pieces defensively. I am waiting for the black attack to begin. } Bg7 16. Be4 Nf6 17. Bxb7 Qxb7 18. Qd3 cxd4 19. cxd4 Rxc1 20. Rxc1 Rc8 21. Rxc8+ Qxc8 {After the long sequence of forcing moves, pawn structure remains symmetrical in a simplified position.} 22. Kh2 Qc6 23. Nf1 {An awkward, bad move.  } Qc1 24. Ng3 Qxb2 {I thought, OK, maybe black is winning this.} 25. Ng5 Qxf2 26. Qc4 {White threatens Qxf7#.} Ne8 {This move turns out to lose the game, as the black queen will be trapped after N3e4.} 27. Ng3e4 Qf5 28. g4 d5 29. Qc6 {And where is black's queen going?  White's knights dominate the position.} Be5+ {A desperate attempt.} 30. Kg2 {And black just resigned here.  How is black saving the queen?  The black position is under tremendous pressure; Qxe8+ is also a threat.}
