1. c4 {Hi again everyone,  It is time for round two.  In the red corner is our WTW&LR Champion, GM Cyrano.  In the blue corner is the Gameknot Champion akjoltoy who starts off with an English Opening.  1. c4.} Nf6 2. Nc3 {2. Nc3 - one pair of knights is developed.} g6 3. e4 d6 4. d4 {4. d4 - in response to Afro's hypermodern style of defense (putting pawns on g6 and d6 and preparing to fianchetto his KB at g7), The Champ puts up an impressive pawn wall on d4,d4 and c4.  Will Afro be cramped for style?  We shall see.} Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 {6. ..... e5 - After fianchettoing his bishop and then castling kingside he now tries to puncture the pawn wall with e5.} 7. O-O {7. 0-0 - The Champ eschews dxe5 and also brings his king to safety.} Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 {8. .... Ne7 - starting to get a little bit like a jstevens1 midgame position (cramped for style) but can Afro find a way round this and prevent passivitis seeping in?  We shall see.} 9. Ne1 {9. Ne1 - interesting retreat - preparing an eventual f4 perhaps.} Nd7 10. Be3 f5 {10. ...... f5 - but it is Afro who suddenly finds a way to break out.  If exf5 then Afro's previous move (Ne7) enables Afro to recapture the pawn with a knight and not weaken his castling position to avoid being a pawn down.} 11. f3 f4 {11. ...... f4 - now Afro tries to drive back The Champ's dsb.} 12. Bf2 g5 13. Rc1 Ng6 14. Nb5 {14. Nb5 - pressure on c7.} b6 15. b4 a6 16. Nc3 Rf7 {16. ..... Rf7 - The Champ's knight has been driven back and Afro is now able to develop his lsb onto b7 and clear the back row decks.  Over the next few moves Afro appears to weaken his castled position by moving pawns up the board but on the other hand he does bring his pieces over to defend his king from a white counter-attack.} 17. Nd3 h5 18. c5 Bf8 19. Kh1 Rg7 20. cxb6 cxb6 {20. ..... cxb6 - an opening of the c column.} 21. Nb2 Rb8 22. Nc4 Nf6 {22. .... Nf6 - continuing to move pieces over to the kingside and over-protecting d6.} 23. Qa4 g4 24. Nxb6 g3 {24. ..... g3 - Afro cannot recapture on b6 but he does have a way out and that is to deflect The Champ's dsb off the f1-a7 diagonal so that the recapture is possible.} 25. Nxc8 gxf2 26. Bxa6 Ng4 {26. .... Ng4 - allo, allo, allo, a knight sac after being two pawns down, whatever is going on here?} 27. fxg4 hxg4 28. Rxf2 Rh7 29. g3 {29. g3 - after being 5 material points up, The Champ offers Afro a draw!  Afro accepts.  Afro can get one material point back by playing fxg3 forking rook and pawn on h2 (which is pinned) and he can also bring his queen to h4 and suddenly Old Matey hangs over the champ so he may need to bring his pieces back and defend against it so it is High Draw honours to Afro - well played there!}
