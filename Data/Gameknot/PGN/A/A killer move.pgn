1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 f6 {Interesting option, but it provides me with a clear target: Qh5+, sac and mate.} 4. Nbd2 Bd6 5. e3 Bxf4 6. exf4 Nc6 7. Nh4 {Here it goes. I don't care if he takes the d4 pawn. } Nge7 {He doesn't, so I protect my d4 pawn. } 8. c3 a6 {Not the best. } 9. Bd3 {I add another piece to be sacced on g6.} b6 {This time he doesn't see it. } 10. Qh5+ Kd7 {Still, it's not so easy to break in. } 11. Qg4 {...threatening g7, if f5.} g6 12. O-O-O {Bringing more material to attack the e6 pawn with rooks. } Bb7 13. Rhe1 f5 14. Qf3 {? Qe2 was more straight-forward. If he defends with Qg8, his pieces are completely tangled.} Qg8 15. Re2 {Re3 was better: when creating an Alekine's gun, the queen needs to be in the last place, ideally.} Kc8 16. Rde1 Nd8 17. Qe3 Kb8 18. Nhf3 {Aiming to g5.} Nec6 19. Ng5 Bc8 {Well, so this is "the unbreakable defence" against "the most powerful attack". If c4, Nb4... so I probably should have played a3.} 20. Nb3 {Just a bad move: he can expand with a5-a4.} h6 21. Nf3 Qf7 22. Ne5 Nxe5 23. Qxe5 {With tempo on the rook, but this is not very useful...} Re8 24. h4 {Containing any g5 idea.} Nc6 25. Qe3 Kb7 26. a4 {Trying something with a5...} a5 {...which he prevents. I'm coductig this attack very badly, being my idea to create a sort of zugswang for black at some point. } 27. Bb5 Re7 28. Qd3 {Rebuilding my Alekine's gun with the Q in the middle.} Bd7 {BxN+ at some point will force him to take with the K, after which I could bring my  Q to b5... but even this is not a clear plan. I have to push c4, this is the break that will give me the game. } 29. Re2e3 Qf6 30. Qe2 Qxh4 {Well, his Q is not defending, so I can go on with my plan.} 31. Bxc6+ Kxc6 32. c4 {? g3 must have been played first.} Qxf4 33. cxd5+ exd5 {...now my R is pinned. But I'll attack the other way.} 34. Qb5+ Kb7 35. Nc5+ {Finally a good move: once the B is removed, the game is mine.} Kc8 36. Nxd7 Rxd7 37. Kb1 {Now it's over. } Qxd4 {Now, Re8+ can be answered with Kb7. Still, after that, RxR, KxR, Re8+ wins. But I found...} 38. Qc6 {...and NOW this is over. There is no defence against Re8+. Thanks for reading .}
