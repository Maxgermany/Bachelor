[Opening "KP (B00), Nimzovich defence, Marshall gambit"]

1. e4 {I was paired with Jeff Lowther in the last round of the same tournament four  years earlier.  I lost quickly in an old stodgy Italian Game position.  Here again, in the 6th and final round, I am about to lose to Jeff a second time in pretty much the same fashion.  I do, however, last a little longer, choking in 20 moves instead of 19.  Only this time I come much closer to victory with correct strategy!} Nc6 {The Nimzowitsch Defense} 2. d4 {Controlling the center with two pawns is natural, and is really the acid test of 1.e4 Nc6.  The alternate 2.Nf3 is played frequently by strong players, intending to either switch back into known Double KP theory or simply get a slightly better position with more space after 2...d6 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3, followed by White developing naturally behind his pawn center.  After 2.d4, Black must decide immediately on a central pawn break: 2...d5 or 2...e5.} d5 {Although Black is fine in the locked center positions resulting from 2...e5 3.d5, White can transpose into Scotch territory after 2...e5 3.Nf3.  Recalling Jeff's splendid play in a normal Double KP position from our previous encounter in 2002, I did not wish to give him that option and instead chose Nimzowitsch's original idea of 2...d5.} 3. e5 {Grabbing space and denying Black the f6 square for his Knight.  So far so good for White.  Other theoretical choices include the critical 3.Nc3 and 3.exd5.} Bf5 {Black can play 3...f6, another strong choice.  But I prefer good old fashion development, leaving the ...f6 break in reserve.} 4. c3 {Obviously concerned about a possible ...Nb4 at some point, White chooses to blunt the Queen Knight and at the same time nail down the d4 pawn, creating a cramping pawn chain.  The c3 pawn can later be used to launch a queenside pawn storm with b2-b4, if Black castles long.} Qd7 {Although we're still in theory, there is something aesthetically pleasing when, after only 4 moves, you have 3 pieces developed and your opponent has zero!} 5. Nf3 f6 {Hitting at the front of the pawn chain, since the base is unassailable.  Here it's even more effective, since the early Nf3 blocks the f-pawn.  Ideally White would like to support e5 with f2-f4, but often White makes this concession for the sake of rapid kingside development.  Black's 5...f6 is well-timed here.} 6. exf6 {Giving up the space-gaining e5 pawn, which cramps Black's kingside, is a strategic error and a serious loss of time in a now semi-open position.  6.Bf4 and 6.Bb5 are theoretically acceptable continuations that maintain tension and concentrate on development.} exf6 {Exclam!  Black does not recapture toward the center with 6...gxf6, nor with the KN, leaving a hole on e5.  Instead Black captures away from the center, opens the e-file and leaves the kingside pawns connected.  White has already lost the opening battle, stumbling into a French Exchange position where Black is up two tempi.} 7. Bf4 {Black wants to play 7...Bd6, so White will swap dark-squared Bishops if that happens.  The down side of 7.Bf4 is the coming ...g5 (with tempo), followed by the rolling of the kingside pawn mass.} O-O-O 8. Be2 {White does not allow the menacing ...Re8 check.} Re8 9. O-O {White's King is safe for the moment, but Black has a super-charged kingside attack that is difficult for White to thwart due to the accelerated nature of the position.} g5 10. Bg3 h5 {One can already feel the speed of Black's kingside pawn storm.  In a normal French Exchange opposite-side castling position, White counters with standard queenside expansion via the pawn pushes b2-b4 and a2-a4, keeping Black on his toes.  Here, instead of counterattacking, White must play careful defense as a consequence of his mistake on Move 6.} 11. h4 {Attempting to slow down Black's onslaught of pawns.  This move buys White some precious time.} Bg4 {Black's second exclam move of the game!  It took me some time to find it over the board, as it moves a piece twice before finishing development.  But the Bishop now creates an annoying pin on the f3 Knight and sets up potential tactics, so its second movement is fully justified.} 12. hxg5 {A horrible blunder!  White was obviously anticipating 12...fxg5, so he could mount his Knight on e5, trade some pieces, and try to neutralize the attack.  But this capture only fuels the fire, allowing the h-pawn to roll.  Resistance is NOT futile after 12.Re1, which unpins the Knight and aids development.  Now the attack is unstoppable.  Realizing his mistake, White sighed and shook his head as I played...} h4 {Exclam number three!  The second tempo hit on the Bishop is costly for White.  The attack is coming full speed and White still has pieces sitting on the bench.  Black has a winning game at this point.} 13. Bf4 {Trying to keep the Bishop active is natural.  If the Bishop retreats to h2, then 13...h3!  White will then need to decide whether to allow his King's position to be ripped open, or to entomb his dark-squared Bishop with 14.g3.  Both choices seem undesirable.} h3 {In the actual game I played 13...Re4?, which puts the Rook on a vulnerable square and does not assist in opening up White's King.  In a few moves I went ape with an unsound exchange sacrifice, along with dropping two pawns.  Black was left with dust in the wind and was forced to resign on Move 20.  But what if the text move (13...h3!) had actually been played?  It seems like such a natural way to continue the attack.  In opposite-side castling positions, use your pawns!  How many times have I heard that?  The only reason I did not play ...h3 immediately was because I visualized White bypassing with the g-pawn and sliding his King under the h-pawn for defense.  But the text is definitely Black's strongest continuation.  Let's see what could have happened.} 14. g3 {Another plausible move, keeping the h-file closed, if only by definition.  I don't think White would even consider signing his own death warrant with the move 14.gxh3.} h2+ {Black tries to sink the h-pawn in the corner pocket!  Objectively White's best here is 15.Kg2, allowing the 15...Bh3  skewer.  15.Nxh2 is obviously worse on account of 15...Bxe2, winning the house.  But the move that most players would probably choose here is the natural 15.Kh1, blocking and using the h-pawn as a shield.  And now...} 15. Kh1 {The moment of truth has arrived.  Black has a nice triple-sac combination which essentially ends the game.  The combination involves 6 key players, all of which are perfectly aligned: 1) The c6 Knight, 2) The g4 Bishop, 3) The Black Queen, 4) The Rook on e8, 5) The Rook on h8, and 6) The macho h2 Pawn.  Black will now show White the true meaning of the Dark Side of The Force!} Rxe2 {Sac 1: The Exchange!} 16. Qxe2 Nxd4 {Sac 2: The Knight!!} 17. cxd4 Qb5 {Sac 3: The Queen!!!  The quiet Queen pseudo-sacrifice ends it all, as White cannot accept due to 18...Bxf3#.  The White Queen is overworked and skewered!  For the record, 18.Qd1 fails to 18...Bxf3  19.Qxf3 Qxf1#, as does 18.Re1 because of 18...Qxe2 19.Rxe2 Bxf3#.  White must lose the Queen or get checkmated.  Anyway, this is how it should have ended.  8-)  0-1}
