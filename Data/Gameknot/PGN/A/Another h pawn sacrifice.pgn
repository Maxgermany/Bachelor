1. e4 {So I got in the habit of playing this, ONLY because it was said to be Bobby Fischer's favorite 1st move.} c5 {And the Sicilian...} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Now there are better moves than what I do as white next. Yeah, yeah, I know I could move Nc3...} 5. Nxc6 bxc6 {At this point, black has what he wants; a superior center, with excellent counter-attacking chances. So black ought to just pursue playing that way, or so I would think.} 6. Bd3 {Because I don't know all the continuations now as many of you know them, I make this quiet move, causing black to think, as this surely isn't the best white response.} e5 {Black makes a decent reply, and threatens to crash down in the center. I for one am glad his bishop isn't going down that diagonal. Not yet, anyways!} 7. c4 {I play c4, indicating that I hope to play in the fashion of the Maroczy bind, trying to tie up the center, but black is positioned so that this should not occur. I've found that in these kinds of positions, black often underestimates the strength of kingside attacks, which will be my goal here. This much I do know: black can thwart this in one of two ways; a break involving ...f5 or ...d5. Which will he choose?} Bc5 {He chooses to develop, preparing to first castle before committing.} 8. O-O O-O {This position is slightly favorable to black, but at least white has the initiative for the moment.} 9. Kh1 {Prophylactic move; black will not have time for Ng4; the best thing for black now may be that central push, which will immediately cause white problems since ...d5 is very good here.} d6 {However, black chooses ...d6, when d5 was much better. Still playable, along with Rb8 or even Re8, however. But not as strong as ...d5.} 10. Bg5 {I choose the best response; Bg5.} h6 {Will he or won't he? Yes, he will. Black asks the question. Rb8 was slightly better here, however.} 11. Bh4 {Far and away the best move for white now.} Rb8 {Here white chooses Rb8, after moving the white bishop off of the c1-h6 diagonal. ...Bd4 was also playable.} 12. Qe2 {And here I make an inaccuracy. Better was Qc2. This eventually costs me a tempo, and could (should?) have cost the game. Perhaps Nc3 was the best move in this position but perhaps not.} Bd4 {What else? ...g5 was a good choice too, depending on black's long-term strategies.} 13. Nc3 {Only one move now for white, Nc3. All other moves and black will be much better than white. As things are now, black is definitely better.} a5 {Inexplicably, however, black now chooses a5, which is not a bad move, but where is the fit with the position here? ...g5 or ...Bg4 or even ...Be6 were both good choices. Bd7 is playable, but a bit passive. a5 will be useful, but... I think it's a bit early here, allowing white some time. Which I need. Lucky me...} 14. Rab1 {Other than moving one of the rooks, f3 was possible. Fritz considered Na4 too, but I did not; it's generally not good to position knights out of the action of course, because with careful play, an opponent can capitalize on the tempos it would take to bring that knight back into the board. And I did not feel like calculating a zillion or so moves to see if Na4 would be okay or not.} Ba6 {This was one of the crucial positions of the game. As tempting as it might be for some to think taking on c3 would be good for black, a closer look reveals it may not be. My opponent saw this, but unfortunately did not see the best move here. Ba6 seemed kind of awkward to me, and to Fritz. Fritz much preferred Be6 or g5; Qe7 is also playable.} 15. Qd2 {And I made a blunder here, but my opponent did not see the combination that would have won him a pawn. Can you spot it? Stop and look for it. Not too hard to spot but this was blitz after all. Anyways, Qc2 was the correct move for white. Also playable was Nd1. Rfc1 was one of Fritz's other choices, but my desire was to play f4 at some point soon, so I did not even look at that. This was also why I missed the possible loss of the pawn. To win a pawn, black responds simply 15...Bxc3 Qxc3 Nxe4 Bxe4 Qxh4 Rfe1 (due to the bishop xray) Qxf2 Bxc6 and things are looking difficult for white.} Qe7 {Lucky for me, black did not wish to part with his bishop pair, and did not even consider looking further. Nxe4 was also possible.} 16. b3 {So I choose the best response here, and the opportunity for black to win a pawn evaporates.} Qe6 {All of this positioning to fight over d5 causes black to lose what could have been had. White's move now is rather obvious, and I waste no time in moving my knight. Other moves are not nearly as good.} 17. Ne2 Bb6 {Provided I make no more blunders, I finally have a small advantage now.} 18. f3 {F4 was better. I played a bit too cautiously here.} Nd7 19. f4 {With the knight gone, now I move f4, effectively wasting another tempo. But, the pressure on my king is more palatable with that knight gone, so... bleh. At least I'm trying to make my plan work.} f6 {Better was ...exf4, after which black is better. But with this move, white has an opportunity to have a lasting advantage. I take it...} 20. f5 Qf7 21. Ng3 Nc5 22. Be2 Rbd8 {Possibly the wrong rook to move by black in this position. The last few moves were all good moves, as we maneuver. I can force the black queen to move, but eschew that for the moment; I am going to obfuscate. That is, I will create a plan on the queenside that black will counter, then pursue my real plan on the kingside, and hope black cannot react quickly enough. Yeah, that's right. I thought this stuff up all right, but I could not see far enough ahead in the time I had to think to know if things would work out or not. As it turns out, it does, but not by much.} 23. a3 Bb7 {...d5 or ...a4 were good choices. This choice I'm not so sure about. } 24. Bh5 {b4 was also good here, but this is the best continuation at this point.} Qe7 25. b4 axb4 26. axb4 Na6 {White maintains a good space advantage at this point. } 27. Ne2 d5 {And now it is my turn to miss a combination, beginning with exd5! after that, we could have ...c5 Qe3 Qc7 Bf2 Rd6 b5 Nb4 and black is really cramped, or perhaps ...cxd5 c5 and black will lose a piece. Other continuations all seem even better for white! But instead of any of that, we get...} 28. c5 {c5. Way to go, idiot me. ;) White is still standing very well now, but I'm really wanting to assault the king, and black is threatening to bust open the middle. Not much I can do about it now, after my last move.} Bc7 {Fortunately, black chooses a response that gives me the smallest chance of keeping the middle from opening up.} 29. Qe3 {And black responds of course correctly... well according to Fritz. But I think taking here would have been better, opening up the middle; black needs counterplay...} d4 {So no taking here either.} 30. Qd3 {Any of the queen moves are rather similar. I choose this move to stop the pawns from advancing while I reposition for my kingside push, cleverly disguised (if I must say so myself, lol) as defending the queenside.} Bb8 31. Rb2 Nc7 32. Rfb1 Nb5 {And has black stymied the queenside? Sure looks like it. Undeterred, I continue...} 33. Be1 Bc7 34. Bd2 {The first real indication that I might have something else planned besides the queenside. However, my opponent doesn't realize the significance of the bishop move. Yet.} Rda8 35. Ng3 Ra3 {And here, I am about to show my real intentions. I had to think, and realized that I would not easily get to the kingside if I allowed c3 to become occupied, so had to make this ungainly rook move...} 36. Rb2b3 Rxb3 {Better for black was doubling his rooks up on the a file.} 37. Rxb3 Ra8 38. Qb1 {Now after this move, black became suspicious, realizing that my moves were really doing nothing over on the queenside. What was I really up to? It's easy to spot, so he tries to prevent it, although Qf8 was a much better way to try...} Kh7 {This I could not stand for!} 39. Bg6+ Kh8 40. Qc1 {So... rather obvious now...} Ra2 41. h3 {I figured I had time to give my King an out.} Bc8 {Qf8 was much better than this blunder. Black has sealed off his queen from pressuring the queenside, and failed to protect the h6 pawn, thinking instead to rid himself of the white bishop, but doing so is much much too slow for this position.} 42. Kh2 {So slow, in fact, that I decide to hide my king altogether before proceeding. In actuality, I'm just lucky he did not move Qf8 here. How can my opponent fail to see the imminent danger, in retrospect, is hard to understand. } Bd7 {The ill-fated black defense.} 43. Bxh6 {Bxh6! How many times must we see a sacrifice on the h pawn to know how bad things can get over there?} gxh6 {There are many defensive tries here, all resulting in 'ruinous' loss of material. This one is the worst choice, alas. Mate will be forced soon now, there is not much for black to do.} 44. Qxh6+ Kg8 45. Nh5 Be8 {Alas, 45...Nc3 was black's last try to defend, with a plus 7.5 score for white. Mate in four, two ways to get there. I choose the easiest.} 46. Rg3 Bxg6 {And now I carelessly move. Qxg6+ followed by Qg8# was correct.} 47. Rxg6+ Kf7 48. Rg7+ {THIS time I gave thought to the mate; ...Ke8 Qh8+ and with the knight coming to f6, it's all over. Black resigned here. So, some simple misdirection, all along planning to sacrifice on h6 if I could. I had a lot of help of course by my opponent in this blitz game. Unless I'm mistaken, most proper Sicilian black moves try to get white castled on the queenside, since black hopes to attack down that side. With my King untroubled over on the kingside, black's remaining pieces are very much unprepared to help defend his own king, directly or indirectly.}
