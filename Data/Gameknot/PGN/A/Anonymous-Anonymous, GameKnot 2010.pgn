1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {Everything is standard so far.} d6 {Interesting. I was hoping that it would end quickly just like Legall's famous game, but my hopes were futile.} 3. Nc3 h6 {A bit of a poor move by Black. I already have two knights developed and Black should instead focus on a move like 3. ... Nf6 or 3. ... Nc6.} 4. Bc4 c6 {Sure, Black's pawn on h6 was helping to stop my knight coming to g5, but I sensed that I had an advantage here.} 5. d4 {This is an alright move, as I wanted to open up the position. 5. d3 might have been better.} exd4 6. Qxd4 {I decide to recapture using the queen instead of the knight. Black is very open to attack and so has to be careful.} Be7 {A mistake. I can now capture the pawn on g7.} 7. e5 {Unfortunately, I didn't see it. Instead, I block the possibility. After 7. Qxg7, Black can only defend the rook with 7. ... Bf6, after which I can play Qxf7#.} c5 8. Qd5 Nc6 {Now Black is in serious trouble.} 9. Qxf7+ {This is similar to Scholar's Mate, but with one vital difference. Black's king can run to d7.} Kd7 10. exd6 Kxd6 {Black gets greedy. Not something you want to do when you're in this type of situation.} 11. Bf4+ Kd7 12. Be6# {Stunning. I never would have expected myself to pull something like this off. If you wish to leave me a suggestion for an annotated game, or want to leave me feedback, please drop me a message. Your help is appreciated.}
