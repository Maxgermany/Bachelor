1. d4 {An irregular opening played by myself. I usually play 1.e4, to create a game where sacrifices and beutiful combonations are aplenty. When I played 1.d4, I created a slow positional game, which most masters prefer.  I however, wanted to try something new, and played 1.d4.} Nf6 {A popular reply by black. This offers blacks best chances at a defense to the queen pawn. Other moves, such as 1.. g6 or 1... d5, would allow a positional downside, where white wins on position. Examples are white taking control of the centre, or black lacking mobility.} 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 g6 {?! Black should play Bb4 to get good centre control, then play c5, the Nimzo-Indian Defense. With the text move, white takes control of the centre (for now).} 4. Nf3 {4.e5 would of given white better chances because of his early takeover of the centre. After 4.e5, white should then fianchetto the king bishop, then castle.} Bg7 5. Bg5 d6 6. e3 O-O 7. Ne4 Nbd7 8. Bd3 b6 9. Nxf6+ Bxf6 10. Bh6 Re8 11. O-O Bb7 12. e4 e5 13. d5 Nc5 14. Rc1 c6 15. h3 {White has completed his development and now plans to swing the knight to h2 and then to g4 (An importand part of the game later on).} Qe7 16. Nh2 Bg5 17. Bxg5 Qxg5 18. Be2 {? I overlooked Nxe4, because of my plan to win the exchange. However, I have a reputation of my swindling, which actually gave the material advantage to me in this game.} Nxe4 19. f4 {An attempted trap that actually worked. After exf4, I would place the bishop on the f3 diagonal, then retake the pawn on c6. If 19... cxd5. I would follow through on my plan to win the exchange.} exf4 20. Bf3 {attempting to recover the pawn with a positional plus, because of the passed pawn on c6 after 21 dxc6 } cxd5 21. Ng4 {Setting up a game winning swindle} Ng3 22. Qd4 {! When the Knight comes to f6, the king can not go to f8, because of Nxh7  This move should draw with correct play.  Doing otherwise would allow a prepetual, drawing the game} dxc4 {Nxf1 is better.} 23. Nf6+ Kg7 24. Nxe8+ {A prepetual attack} Kf8 25. Qh8+ {The King of black is now in jeopardy. Before, he was up three pawns. Now he is down one point. Unfortunately, with proper attack by white, the king of black will be vagrant for the rest of his days.} Ke7 26. Rfe1+ {Winning a piece after Kd7 followed by Bxb7.} Kd7 27. Bxb7 Qc5+ {This defers the attack. I personally was intiminated by the check because black may have a decent attack.} 28. Kh2 Rd8 {White mates in four.} 29. Nf6+ Kc7 30. Re7+ {Now the King can't avoid a mate. This game is a decent example on how to win a lost game. 1. Get the initiative. This is the first move. Always importand when starting an attack. You may have to sacrifice a pawn or  two. 2. Attack. Threaten material. It may make him intiminated. 3. Win. I can't explain how a swindle actually works. This is the general idea.}
