1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 cxb2 5. Bxb2 {I am in my much loved Danish Gambit.} Nf6 6. Qf3 {Maybe this is wrong. But as the bishops dominate diagonals in the Danish game. The queen needs to help.} d5 7. exd5 Bb4+ {? This doesn't bail black out.} 8. Nd2 Bxd2+ 9. Kxd2 {Moving my king isn't a big deal. Actually, instead of moving my knight to block I should have played Kf1.} Bg4 {This looks like one of those great moves that prove decisive.} 10. Re1+ Kf8 11. Qa3+ {I get out with a tempo.} Kg8 12. Bxf6 {!! The queen can't leave the back rank and the pawn needs to remain.} Qc8 13. Bd4 {I have learned there is a time to retreat.} Nd7 {?? The losing move. Now his bishop isn't defended.} 14. Qg3 {! It is over.} h5 15. h3 Nf6 16. hxg4 Nxg4 17. f3 {He resigned. A second piece would go and he still wouldn't be out of the attack.}
