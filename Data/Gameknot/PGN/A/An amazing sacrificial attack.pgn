[Opening "English (A34), symmetrical variation"]

1. c4 {The English Opening, fairly well-known. This can lead to a "Reversed Sicilian" and a lot more besides.} c5 2. Nc3 e5 {This reply can't be common.} 3. Nf3 d6 4. Ne4 Nf6 5. Ng3 {I am preparing my kingside to castle into. This kind of castled position, with the knights in front, fulfils my ideals of a safe kingside and also comes in handy when attacking the opponent's kingside.} Be7 6. e4 O-O 7. Be2 Bg4 8. O-O {Now my king looks very safe...and that's not all! I am already planning an attack!} Nc6 9. d3 a6 {I'm not sure about this move...it looks pretty pointless...} 10. Nf5 {In my notation I gave this move an !-mark, but it is so long ago that I have forgotten why. Can anyone help me?} Rb8 11. Bg5 h6 12. b3 {This move sacrifices my bishop, obviously. I gave it a !? in my notation. I did not need to play that particular move; I just needed to "pass" a move so that my opponent could take my bishop and allow my attack to start.} hxg5 {He takes the bait.} 13. Nxg5 Bxe2 14. Qxe2 {I now have my knights in an excellent attacking position. All that remains now is to bring up my queen...} Nh5 {This has to be a blunder. Perhaps my opponent was after 15.Qxh5 Bxg5, neutralising my attack. But he must have overlooked this continuation:} 15. Nxe7+ Qxe7 16. Qxh5 {1-0. Black resigned. His only way of preventing checkmate was to sacrifice his queen for my knight. In retrospect I now believe that if he had not played 14...Nh5?? my opponent could have prevented my queen from entering the action and neutralised my attack.}
