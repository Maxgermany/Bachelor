[Opening "Giuoco Piano (C53)"]

1. e4 {standard opening... i dont know the names of them but this one is common} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {I want to control d4 and weaken blacks active bishop as with this opening i like to use Ng5 if black castles king side} 4. c3 Nf6 5. Ng5 {with black blocking the queens cover of g5, i jump in with the knight on g5, i choose this as it is clear black is looking to castle king side} O-O {and theres the castle} 6. d3 {i would have preferred d4, but with the early movement of the knight to g5 i like strength to hold the d4 square. So, d3 is strengthening the lead pawn at e5 and also opening the bishop to protect my knight at g5} d6 {black wants to launch a king side attack} 7. h3 {one of the drawbacks to the d3 pawn move was it locked out my white bishop, i make h3 here to prevent my queen from being pestered which would result in my pawn structure reducing mobility.} a6 {black is some what locked down  here, making the move a6 then looking to go for b5 lacks any immediate threat... this was a turning point in the game, black should have played h8 kicking my knight on g5} 8. O-O {mentioning that black was locked down, white here too doesn't have any decisive moves so seemed like a great time to complete development and castle kingside} Bd7 {i dont quite know what blacks plan is here, perhaps to sacrifice the bishop on a4 setting up a fork of the queen and white bishop... again this would have been a good point to kick my g5 knight.} 9. Nd2 {i don't see any holes to aim for quite yet, I just want to get some more peices over king side to be ready to capitalize when I see something} b5 {i guess black was trying to open up the a file for his rook here or perhaps undermine my strong white bishop with a follow up move of Be6 which could also open the f file for blacks rook} 10. Bd5 {here i see that blacks failure to kick my g5 knight could cause black problems now, instead of moving my bishop back to b3 i move up to d5 offering a trade for the black knight on f6 which would cause issues for black after Qh5. I think black wasted a couple of moves back with the a and b pawns and the Bd7 move. This has left his development a bit cluttered and allowed for my d5 bishop and g5 knight to build up some early pressure on black's kingside} b4 {this was another wasted move, the attack does not develop any major threats and does not reduces blacks building kingside pressure} 11. Nc4 {the hole left by the questionable b4 pawn advance provides my knight with a good post at c4. I am now looking to move my queen out to the open king side, i dont know exactly what the knight on c4 can to to help me know but blacks lack of meaningful attack means i can use it for my offense} bxc3 {again, no major threat} 12. bxc3 Rb8 13. d4 {I want to remove the defender at f6 to allow my queen to attack the h7 pawn, the attack is beginning to take shape now} exd4 14. cxd4 {i am happy to weaken my queen side in exchange for more room to attack on blacks the center and king side with my more developed peices} Bxd4 {now i finally see blacks attack,  he has my h1 rook here... i could make it an exchange by moving my c1 bishop.... but my kingside attack will be more potent, so I decide to allow black to have his way with my queenside while I finalize kingside attack} 15. Bxc6 {i want to weaken the e5 square so i can kick the f6 knight of defense} Bxa1 {again, my attack is more potent so i am happy to see the black bishop head off to the corner} 16. Bxd7 {blacks kingside is getting much weaker, I have lost a rook and bishop  for a knight and bishop... but at this stage in the game blacks knight and bishop where more important} Qxd7 17. Qc2 {no comes the good part. the move Qc2 makes for a discovered checkmate threat if i move my pawn to e5 attacking the knight. So after pawn to e5 black must take with the d6 pawn, after which i will take back with the c4 knight (knew it would be useful for something) which would attack the black queen forcing it to move allowing for the knight to then jump to g4 attacking the f6 defender.   (first i have to get the black away from defense of the e5 square.  At this point i am significantly down in material but that material was sacrificed to open up opportunities for checkmating attacks. From here black needs to defend well to avoid checkmate} Bd4 {it is to late for black to move the attack to kingside, he should have defended with h6... a move which would have really made this game much different.  The attempt to put pressure on my king side is coming at the wrong time and also gifts me the trade of dark squared bishops and opening the f file for my rook.  It may have made sense to trade down material because black was well up on material here, but this move was definitely a blunder as it opened the most important defensive piece to and open file rook.  Once again f6 would have solve problems for black} 18. Be3 Bxe3 19. fxe3 {... thanks for that trade, see the rook is now aimed squarely at the piece holding up blacks defense.} Qc6 {another poor move by black, and once again f6 gos begging. mate is close to forces from here} 20. e5 {the final chance for f6 from black to save his game} dxe5 {boh} 21. Rxf6 {i was happy with the game because it would have been easy to try to rush the attack or stop it to try and prevent material loss but it was timed well and helped out by a couple of slight errors from black got a nice forced mate.}
