1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {All according to the book.} e5 6. Ndb5 {Dare to be different. I wanted to play this game like the Kalashnikov Variation.} d6 7. Be2 {Not sure about this move. I wanted to castle but did not want to spend tempo protecting the Knights either.} a6 8. Na3 {The drawback to the plan is that Black has the Knight placed on c6 with tempo. I will still spend more time using the Knights. Reminds me a bit of Alekhine's Defense with all that hopping around and whatnot.} b5 {Black's plan is simple. Push the pawn to b4 and capture Knight. I can retreat one and reposition the other but the e4 pawn is left en prise a la Nc6.} 9. Naxb5 {My counter is equally simple. Gambit the Knight. If I am to go down in material, at least it should be in exchange for position. I can strive for play on the Queenside.} axb5 10. Bxb5 Bd7 11. Bg5 {Pin the problem Knight. Mobility is essential for me now. My other pieces and pawns need to be repositioned with minimum interference.} Be7 12. Bxf6 {I decide to make good on my threat. I give up the Bishop pair but I relieve pressure from my e4 pawn and open an outpost on d5.} Bxf6 13. O-O O-O {Black gets the King to safety and further reduces the impact of my Bishop.} 14. Nd5 Bg5 15. c4 {I consolidate the centre of the board and plan to dominate the light squares.} Rb8 16. a4 Nd4 {Black's Knight grabs a strong outpost.} 17. Qd3 Bxb5 18. axb5 {I want to make the opened a-file Black's Achilles' Heel. The b- and c- pawns can gain much honour in the battle ahead.} f5 {Black counterattacks on the Kingside with the intent to destabilize my centre and open lines to my King.} 19. f3 f4 {Any number of siege plans can follow. I did not analyze the Kingside in detail but pawns + Bishop + Knight + Queen/Rook just felt bad for me. I needed to hurry up.} 20. b4 {No use having backward pawns. This move allows me to push c5. It also restricts Black from getting to a5.} Bh4 21. Ra6 g5 22. b6 {We both surge onward.} h5 23. c5 g4 24. Ra7 gxf3 25. Rxf3 {We both ignore the other's plans and hope our own attack is better. The ultimate game of "Chicken." I loved it!} Nxf3+ {Who cares about a silly Rook anyway?} 26. Qxf3 Qg5 27. c6 Rba8 28. Nc7 {Lancelot makes his presence known!} Rac8 29. Ne6 {A fork comes in handy every so often.} Rxc6 {Planning one last assault with Rc1. I suppose that I should spend a move to protect the King (Ra1 Qg6, Nxf8 Kxf8, b7 Rb6) which knocks some wind out of my sails.} 30. Nxg5 {We've ignored each other thus far. Why ruin a good thing? I had faith in my plan. I wonder if my opponent was still confident with his?} Rc1+ 31. Qf1 Rxf1+ 32. Kxf1 Bxg5 {Still down materially...} 33. b7 {... but man! what a great position.} f3 34. Ra8 fxg2+ 35. Kxg2 {Black resigns.}
