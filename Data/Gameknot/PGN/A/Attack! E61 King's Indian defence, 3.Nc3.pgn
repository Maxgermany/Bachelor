1. d4 {I played this game at my local chessclub. My opponent needed a win for promotion and actually I thought I was lost allready since I'd had only four hours of decent sleep the previous night! } Nf6 2. c4 g6 {With the kingside fianchetto black aims his bishop on the central squares e5 and d4, where the pressure on d4 can soon be increased by playing   ...e5 or ...c5.} 3. Nc3 {Forcing black to make a commitment, as to wether to play the Gruenfeld, or to play 3..Bg7, allowing white to play the move e4, wich would stop the Gruenfeld.} Bg7 {3..d5 would have entered the Gruenfeld defence.} 4. e4 {The King's Indian defence is a very tricky opening wich can lead to some nice chances for black when handled improperly by white. This is often based on the strength of the bishop along the diagonal.} d6 {It's not easy for white to find the right defence against black's setup, mostly because this opening has so many variations, wich can only be compared to the Sicilian defence.} 5. Nf3 {5.f3 is also very common, planning on castling queenside and using the kingside pawns for the attack. At the post-mortem my opponent told me he always plays 5.f3 when playing white in this opening. } O-O {The most common continuation.} 6. Be2 {Straight from the book.} c5 {...e5 is played more often.} 7. d5 {The 'best' move here.} Nfd7 { ?! Black is not wasting time and wants to play ...f5 as soon as possible and open the c-file for attacking chances. Still, 7...e6 would have been much stronger.} 8. Bd2 {8. O-O was also playable, but eventually I decided to develop my bishop first and avoid the doubled pawns after 8....Bxc3 9.bxc3.} f5 {As expected.} 9. Qc1 {? I must admit this is a strange move and this shows I was rather tired. I was looking for something like 10.Bh6 Bxh6 11.Qxh6. Better would have been simply 9.exf5 } Ne5 {Black must move the knight on d7 again in order to develop his bishop.} 10. O-O {I now think 10.Nxe5 followed by 11.exf5 would have been stronger, but I was looking to complicate things a little.} fxe4 11. Nxe4 Bf5 12. Neg5 {With the treat of a possible fork on e6.} Nbd7 {My opponent spent 15 minutes before making this move! I then spent quite some time myself before making my next move since I immediately saw he was either trying to provoke 13.Nh4 or he had just missed it and now 'just' developed his knight.} 13. Nh4 {I decided to go for it...} Bd3 {!?This came as an unpleasant surprise to me..I had completely missed this move, wich leads to a nice combination!} 14. Ne6 {Black must still move his queen first.} Qb6 {And does so very effectively!} 15. Nxf8 Bxe2 {The point of 13...Bd3: 16.Re1 Nd3! wins for black.} 16. Nxd7 Nxd7 {These moves are almost forced...} 17. Qe1 {? Here I missed a win, because after 17.Re1!? Bxb2 18.Qb1 Bxa1 19.Qxa1 Bxc4 20.Bh6! black is lost! } Bxf1 18. Qe6+ {Much stronger than 18.Qxf1. White can now regain some initiative. Somehow the previous moves of my opponent served as a wake up call for me, since I slowly felt my position slip away..} Kh8 19. Rxf1 Ne5 {? 19...Qxb2 20.Bc1 Qf6 21.Qxd7 Qxh4 22.Qxb7 Rf8 is ok for black, with a more or less equal position.} 20. Bc3 {Finally, the bishop becomes more active. Let the attack begin!} Qc7 {?? A blunder in a bad position. Black should have tried 20...Nxc4 21.Bxg7  Kxg7 22.Qxe7  Kg8 though white is still better.} 21. Re1 {The rook is on its way to h3! } Re8 {? 21...Qc8 was the best move here I think. Blacks play is becoming increasingly more passive.} 22. Re3 {Here I was trying to provoke 22....Nxc4?? 23.Nxg6 ! followed by 24.Rh3  and mate follows.} Rf8 {?? A fatal blunder from my opponent! 22...Qc8 would have saved him as we'll see after my next move..} 23. Bxe5 {Taking away the defender of g6!} dxe5 {23...Bxe5 24.Nxg6  hxg6 25.Qxg6! ( not 25.Rh3  Kg7 )  threatening mate with Rh3 , 25...Qc8! 26.Kf1!! and black is also lost.  ( again not 26.Rh3 ? Qxh3! 27.gxh3 Rg8 and black comes out a bishop ahead. )    Regarding the note at move 22: if black had played 22...Qc8 then after 23.Bxe5 Bxe5! 24.Nxg6 ? hxg6 25.Qxg6 the position is uncertain. I tried analysing some lines but the postion is full of pitfalls. Here is one line I liked: after 25.Qxg6  25...Rf8 26.Kf1! Rxf2 ? 27.Kxf2 Bd4 28.Ke2 Bxe3 29.Kxe3  This was all hard to see and I doubt I would not have played 23.Bxe5 and 24.Nxg6  because it was simply to deep to calculate for me at that time...} 24. Nxg6+ {And so after waiting patiently for ten moves, the knight on h4 makes his  third move of the game and my opponent simply resigned because of: 24...hxg6 25.Rh3  Bh6 26.Rxh6  Kg7 27.Qxg6 mate.  Needless to say, that night I had some sweet dreams ;) Hope you enjoyed,  Sarasani  PS. If you have suggestions or corrections please message me!}
