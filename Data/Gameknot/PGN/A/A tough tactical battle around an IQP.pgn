1. d4 {I think I initiated this challenge against a higher-rated player with a higher score in D1. I adopted a suitably conservative opening move.} Nf6 2. c4 d5 {An interesting move order.  I have vague memories of having been stuffed by White after playing this after 3. cxd5 Nxd5 but I can't believe it's actually wrong.  As White, I continue to take a conservative approach.} 3. Nc3 {Develops a piece and piles pressure on d5.} e6 4. Bg5 {Now we're in QGD Orthodox territory.} Be7 5. Nf3 c6 {a sound continuation, leading to a typical Slav-type position.  I'm not sure exactly which one... nuntar to the rescue?} 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Bd3 h6 {I'd expected 7.....dxc4 8. Bxc4 which seeks to prove that White has wasted a tempo with 7. Bd3 but this is a perfectly acceptable continuation for Black.} 8. Bh4 {White prefers to keep the 2 bishops, if possible.  He needn't worry about Black's KN exposing an attack on the Bh4 because Black can't take any White pieces in the process of revealing the attack and White can merely swap on e7.} b6 {Black prepares to fianchetto his q-side B.  His pawn structure already restricts this B.  White's Bishops are much better because of their greater freedom of movement and influence on the position.} 9. O-O {With castling, White's development is nearly complete (Rc1 and Qc2 will complete his development), whereas Black still needs to make at least four moves to complete his development (...Bb7, ...0-0, ....Rc8 and ... Qc7 for example)} Bb7 10. Rc1 Rc8 11. cxd5 {White engages Black in tactical exchanges before he has completed his development.} exd5 12. Re1 {exerting pressure on the potentially open e-file...} O-O 13. Qc2 c5 {Black counter-attacks on the centre.} 14. dxc5 {White prefers not to have an IQP ...} Nxc5 15. Bf5 {I also prefer not to allow my B to be swapped off and instead attack Black's Rc8} Ne6 16. Bxf6 {Removing one of Black's defenders of his IQP at the expense of giving up my beloved Bishop pair.  They say that chess is often about choosing the right moment to convert one sort of advantage into another and I think I just about got this right, though Black's Bishops do now look strong.} Bxf6 17. Red1 {and adding pressure to the isolani by occupying the half-open d-file and preparing to blockade on d4 with the Nf3} Qe7 {removing the Q from the same file as White's R and apparently ceding the d-pawn, until White notices that his Nc3 is pinned against his Q} 18. Qb3 {...releasing the pin and increasing the pressure on d5.  There are now 3 attackers on d5 but only one defender.  On the other hand, White still can't use both Nc3 and Rd1 to take on d5, as the Rc1 would be vulnerable...} Bxc3 {removing one of the attackers} 19. Rxc3 {Now the R on the c-file is properly defended by a pawn but the d-pawn is only attacked by major pieces while it's still defended by a minor piece, so still OK} Rxc3 20. Qxc3 {White preserves his pawn structure and maintains the pressure on Black's position} Rd8 {For now the pawn is safe and Black can even think about using it as a battering ram to attack White's position} 21. Nd4 {so White blockades it with his N} Nc5 {Black avoids the swap and threatens to take control of e4} 22. Rc1 {White cannot prevent Black from occupying e4 except by playing f3, which would weaken e3 and his King's position, so he threatens instead to invade on c7} g6 {pushing the annoying B away} 23. Bg4 Ne4 24. Qc7 Qxc7 25. Rxc7 {White's rook is dominant now} Rb8 26. Bf3 {White piles the pressure onto d5 again, pinning the N against it} Nd6 27. Nc6 {cutting off the B's defence of the d5 pawn.  The alternative tactic was the skewer of N an p with Rd7 but this path swaps off another pair of minor pieces at the same time} Bxc6 28. Rxc6 Ne4 {still preserving the pawn!} 29. Rc7 {the pawn on d5 survives, the N is back on its great outpost but White can now attack the weak a-pawn with his dominant rook} a6 30. Be2 {attacking the a-pawn again and preparing to push the N away from e4} a5 31. Rd7 {getting behind the IQP, not so much with a view to taking it immediately but to tying Black up in its defence} Nf6 32. Rd6 {forking pawn and N, so Black has to defend the N with his K} Kg7 {Now Black's pieces are all tied up and White still has a free agent in his B...} 33. Bf3 {which attacks the pawn again} Rc8 {threatening a back row mate} 34. h3 Rc1+ 35. Kh2 b5 {Black could have saved his d-pawn instead with ...Rc5 but that would have tied the rook awkwardly to a defensive task, or he could have counter-attacked White's pawns with ...Rc2.  Advancing the backward pawn seems OK though.} 36. Bxd5 {Finally the d-pawn falls!} Rd1 {creating a double attack on the B which is pinned against the R.  Was that a "hot" pawn?} 37. e4 Nxe4 38. Rd7 {counter-attacking f7, where giving check will allow White time to regroup} Ng5 39. f4 {to force the defender of f7 to move} Ne6 {?? The N blocks the attack on f7 but its defender, the pawn on f7, is pinned against his K, so} 40. Bxe6 Rxd7 41. Bxd7 b4 {Now, as commentators say, it should be "a matter of technique" for White to win} 42. g4 {First I set up a barrage along the fourth rank and then plan to march my K across the board to the q-side pawns, mop those up and then queen my own} Kf6 43. Kg3 Ke7 44. Ba4 {Preventing the q-side pawns from moving} f6 45. Kf3 {and, as he was winning the other game mrloca suggested we called a halt at this point and shared the points, so I resigned the other game and he resigned this.  I was quite glad, as there was still some hard work to be done here.}
