[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 c6 {I've been playing the Caro-Kann for more than thirty years. Wow. It's mostly a conservative defense to e4, though I often try to spice it up a little.} 2. d4 {White achieves his goal of dominating the center with two pawns.} d5 {And Black says no way, you can't have the whole center like that. But the reason I like the Caro-Kann more than the French (which would look the same except the back pawn is on e6 instead of c6) is that it doesn't block Black's bishops as badly.} 3. e5 {Almost everyone either plays e5 or Nc3 against me. Less often, White trades the pawns. What made me laugh is I just started a practice game with a team member where I'm giving him advice/lessons while we play, and this is the variation he chose, too.} Bf5 {I get my bishop developed before I play e6 and block it.} 4. Nf3 {Big difference between the two games. In my practice game, White played Nc3 here (an extremely unusual move). In this game, White plays the most common move. You've got to develop your pieces! And White puts his knight on its natural and best square.} e6 5. Be2 Nd7 6. O-O Qc7 7. Nh4 {There's a new and unexpected move. I really don't mind trading away that bishop -- it's kind of in the way, but I don't want to have to capture back exf5 and mess up my pawn center. So my choices seem to be Ne7, Bg6, and Be4.  I like that Ne7 develops a piece, but I'm not ready to block in my bishop yet and get in the way of my c5 plans.} Be4 8. Nc3 {Well, I can see I'm going to have to move my bishop back to g6, but I won't do it with his knight sitting on h4. Once it goes back home, then I can retreat my bishop.} Be7 9. Nf3 Bg6 10. a4 Bb4 {I'm threatening to mess up his pawns. I had to get the bishop off of e7 so I can develop my knight. It doesn't have any hope of getting out on f6.} 11. Bd2 Ne7 {Now I can castle either direction.  If he plays Na2, I'm happy to trade bishops. I'm curious if he'll threaten my other bishop with Nh4 again. I don't think he would, because I'll just recapture with the knight. In this closed position, the knights are probably stronger than the bishops. But I'm not sure what other threat he's going to work on. Maybe I can start looking at some counter-attacks. I'd like to play c5. It's guarded three times. I'd probably recapture with the bishop so it is attacking f2 and so my knight on d7 then attacks the pawn on e5. That's if he trades. But before I can do that I'll want to play a6 so his knight can't come up to b5. I like it that his knight doesn't have any strong squares to move to right now.} 12. Nb5 {I sure didn't expect this. No use doing lots of analysis to see what's up, because I really only have move I can make. He's attacking the queen and the knight. The only place i can put the queen without losting the bishop is a5, but after he takes the bishop and I play Qxb4, he gets to play Nc7+ and wins the rook.    So I have to take the knight. When you play, don't get caught up trying to always figure out what your opponent's plan is -- what you need to do is find your best move.} cxb5 13. Bxb4 bxa4 14. c3 Nb6 15. Bb5+ Nc6 16. Bd6 Qd7 {A hard decision for me. I feel that I want to move Qd8 or Qd7 so my Q can keep an attack on d6 (after I play Nc4 at some point). The problem with Qd7 is my knight remains pinned. The problem with Qd8 is if he plays Bxc6, I don't want to have to recapture with the b-pawn, I feel.} 17. Bc5 a6 {Those two bishops are killing me. Did he give me a way to get rid of one of them?} 18. Bxa4 Nxa4 {Good riddance to one of those bishops. I imagine the Q will recapture and take its place, but at least my knight won't be pinned then.} 19. Qxa4 Na7 {I think the reason my rating got so high was that I did very well in a couple of endgames against two 2200 rated players. So let's see if that plan works for me again, here.} 20. Qa5 Nc6 {If he retreats to a4, I'll play Na7 again. I'd be happy with a draw when I'm playing Black against someone rated 150 points above me.} 21. Qa3 Ne7 {I'm thinking that there absolutely nothing for me on the queenside. Maybe I can swing my knight around and start up something on the kingside. I don't see how to get my rooks into the game with his bishop on c5. Even after this move, though, I still can't castle because he's attacking the knight twice, and it would only be guarded once.} 22. Rfe1 Bd3 {Looks like White is getting ready in case I play f6. No, I'm not comfortable opening this up. I'm just trying to find ways to improve my pieces. Do I see any threats on the horizon? Maybe b4 and b5 would be difficult to deal with.  Now that I've made the move, I'm wondering if I need to take a look at h5 -- but I don't see it leading anywhere unless I put both rooks over there, and I'm not thrilled with castling queenside.} 23. b3 Ng6 24. Re3 Qb5 {I'd like to go for a draw here, but I just took a look at our match standings. We're down 0-2 with my two games remaining. That means I have to win this one to keep from losing the match. That makes things tougher.} 25. g3 Bf5 26. c4 {Well, in a way, that's a scary move. I figured that White couldn't make that move because I had the square covered twice. Now I need to look deeper and see what I missed. After I trade on c5, I'm expecting Rc3. Or, maybe he'll let me capture on c4 and then on b3 and play Rxb3, aiming at my pawn on b7. It's not like my king can get out of the center. I gotta think about this. My other choice is to retreat the queen, like to c6 so he can't use the b-file for his attack. I think/hope I'll be playing Kd7 eventually to link my rooks. } Qc6 27. Rc1 Bg4 {Threatening to win the knight after dxc4. The problem is that the threat's easily thwarted.} 28. cxd5 Qxd5 29. Nd2 Bh3 {Qg2# is an obvious threat and easily blocked. I really don't have anything left unless White makes a serious blunder. Not likely from a 2200-rated player. I think it's time to resign.} 30. Ne4 Kd7 31. f3 {}
