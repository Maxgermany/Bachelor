1. e4 c5 {Team match started so long ago on Jan 25, 2009. I won the first game and annotated it as Short and Sweet on Feb 7, 2009. This game took more effort. I'm playing black and resort to the Sicilian. Nothing really clever here to talk about. This one's just a slow, inexorable rout.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {Normal up to now, and black tries the Sveshnikov Variation.} 6. Ndb5 d6 {White wants to play 7. Nd6 so black takes away the square by occupying it with a twice-defended pawn.} 7. Bc4 a6 {7. Bg4 was recommended. 7. Bc4? loses material.} 8. Na3 b5 {Threatens white's bishop and threatens 9. ... b4 forking the two knights.} 9. Naxb5 axb5 10. Bxb5 Bd7 {The knight was pinned and must be defended. Black has won a knight for two pawns, but has given white a pair of passed pawns on a2 and b2, which might be adequate compensation.} 11. Nd5 Nxe4 {But not if white persists in discarding pawns.} 12. Be3 Rb8 13. c4 Qa5+ {Ahead in material, black decides to get rid of some of it.} 14. Bd2 Nxd2 15. Qxd2 Qxd2+ 16. Kxd2 Nd4 {And get rid of more of it.} 17. Bxd7+ Kxd7 {OK, material has been largely liquidated, time to turn this little advantage (bishop for pawn) into a big advantage.} 18. Rab1 Nc6 19. a3 Rb3 20. f4 Be7 {Maybe he'll trade, maybe he won't. The bishop isn't going anywhere useful, but hopefully the rook will get off of h8, maybe even occupy a half-open file.} 21. g3 Rhb8 22. Nb4 Nxb4 23. axb4 Rb8xb4 {Trading, with a bonus pawn. Now black is up a clear bishop.} 24. Kc2 exf4 {Isolating white's pawns.} 25. gxf4 Bf6 {Sure, black can scoop up the pawn on c4. But black can do that any time. Why not chase one that's actually harder to get?} 26. Rhd1 Rb3xb2+ {With the added bonus of forking a rook and liquidating even more material.} 27. Rxb2 Rxb2+ 28. Kc1 Rxh2 {And another bonus pawn.} 29. c5 Be7 30. f5 Rf2 31. cxd6 Bxd6 32. Rh1 Bh2 {I thought this was rather clever of me. Blocking white so he can't threaten any black pawns.} 33. Rd1+ Ke7 34. Re1+ Kf6 35. Rh1 Kxf5 {After clever move 32, this one is a tactical blunder. The last white pawn could wait; it certainly wasn't going anywhere. 35. ... Rg2! forces a rook trade after 36. ... Rb1. Getting rid of white's last piece (even at an even trade) would have been preferable to chasing a mere pawn.} 36. Kd1 Ke4 {Now if 37. Re1+ then 37. ... Kd3 puts an end to white. If 38. Re7 threatening pawns, black simply plays 38. ... Rf1+ 39. Re1 Rxe1 40. Kxe1 and white is done - black promotes a pawn and checkmates soon after. But at this point my opponent timed out, so the game remains unfinished. After 84 days for 36 moves, I can't say I'm too disappointed - the outcome was already decided anyway.}
