1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d6 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. Nbd2 {Black lsb early outcome is not to worry me.   } Nbd7 5. h3 {I plan a pawn storm anyway, so this is just tempo gained. } Bxf3 {This is kind of wise. I had may doubts about how to retake. gxf was too early - he can easily castle Qside - exf3 gets me control of e4, but allows e5 from black. } 6. Nxf3 {e5 control is of primary importance if I want to control black's developement. True is that now I can't play e4.} g6 {If e5 is now allowable, let's get the B on a good diagonal. Very good, this guy knows how to play.} 7. Qd3 {Surprise! Now I will play e4 all the same, unless he plays d5, losing a tempo.} Bg7 8. e4 O-O 9. c3 {Qc4 can't be played at once, so I wanted to be patient, and kind of solid.} Re8 {Now e5 is a threat, and I don't want to go for the "exchange all" line e5. } 10. O-O-O {Now e5 will set a discovered attack on black's Q. Let's see if he dares.} e6 {No, he didn't, but he did shield f7, my next target. Nxf7 is my move, but I can't play it right now.} 11. g4 h6 {Space grabbing, and weakening. I already see an e5 to come, with threat on h7. How to force it?} 12. Be2 {Preparing. I feel I need to build a little more. } g5 {? I know this kind of defence, and in some moves it will turn in my favour.} 13. Bg3 Qc8 {Preparing c5. I can't distract defending, or I'll lose my attack chance.} 14. h4 gxh4 {Again, three ways to retake. With the R, it wins a move in doubling R and defends g4. Nx threatened the sac Ng6 (fxN, e5 and wins). Bxh4 threatened BxN, BxB, e5.} 15. Rxh4 {? Probably the worst. } d5 {Better than I saw.} 16. e5 {? I can't give his N a post on e4!} Ne4 {...but I did! Now, what? g5 is my point, I just have to be sure Bg7 is going somewhere.} 17. Rdh1 c5 {Here he comes. } 18. g5 {He can't use the N to take it so easily. } hxg5 {One more tempo, just one...} 19. Rh4h5 {Now Nxg5 should win, but he is coming strong, too!} cxd4 {I have no mate in h7: I have to think about tomorrow. Too bad for my attack: I can retake it later.} 20. Nxd4 {It seems a mistake, but it has some sense. } Nxe5 21. Bxe5 Bxe5 22. f3 {...and the black N can't retire or Rxg5+. I was kind of proud of having spotted the combination in a blitz!} Bf4+ 23. Kb1 {Nd2+, Ka1, and black loses the N all the same. N has a lot of forks, but he can't give  them or Qh7+} Kf8 24. fxe4 {No point in check him, I better cash the win.} dxe4 25. Qxe4 {...with another idea in mind. Let's see if he falls for it. } Ke7 {He does. } 26. Nf5+ Kd7 {Now, now, now: how to proceed? I can't solve the Bf4 coverage of the dark squares, so his K will find shield. Rd1+ is ok, but...} 27. Bb5+ {...gives me the exchange.} Kc7 {Here, I played a move for the posterity, for good or for bad.} 28. Rh5h7 {??} exf5 29. Rxf7+ Kb8 30. Qxe8 Qxe8 31. Bxe8 {...but after all I'm still up a R for two pawns. How can I lose this?} a6 32. Rxf5 Ka7 33. Ba4 Rd8 34. Rh7 Rd6 35. Rff7 Rb6 36. Bc2 Be5 37. Kc1 {Normal manouvering. I plan to play my B to e4, and break in b7.} Bf4+ 38. Kd1 Rd6+ {HERE I blundered. } 39. Ke2 {?? No comment. Blitzes.} Rd2+ 40. Kf3 Rxc2 41. Rfxb7+ Ka8 42. Rbd7 Rxb2 43. Rd8+ Rb8 44. Rhh8 Rxd8 45. Rxd8+ Kb7 46. a4 a5 47. c4 {...and from here, despite my R, I was not able to win.} Kc6 48. Ra8 Bd2 49. Ke4 Kc5 50. Rc8+ Kb4 51. Kd3 Bf4 52. c5 Kxa4 53. c6 Kb5 54. Kd4 a4 55. Kd5 a3 56. Ra8 Kb4 57. Rg8 a2 58. Ra8 {Trying a way to win, I got myself in troubles. Serious ones. } Kb3 59. Ra6 Kb2 60. Rb6+ Kc2 61. Ra6 Kb1 62. Rb6+ Kc2 63. Ra6 Kb2 64. Rb6+ Kc2 65. Ra6 Kb2 {Draw was agreed. }
