1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This is the penultimate game of The Annotation Project Part 1.  Freddy has just started Part 2 and he is currently one of my opponents.  Can I redeem myself this time? Ah well, that is the future.  This game is the here and the now and this game pushed my rating back into the 1830s.  We pick up the action on move 9. where e6 seems the most popular choice in this opening now.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6 {9. ...... e6 - see my intro note.} 10. Nc3 Na6 {10. ...... Na6 - development and looking at Nb4 next move which is indeed played.} 11. Bxe6 Nb4 12. Bb3 {12. Bb3 - to prevent Nc2+.} c4 13. Ba4+ b5 14. Bxb5+ Kb7 {14. ...... Kb7 - a few black pawns have dropped off - now has Henry found a safe haven?} 15. O-O Bc5+ {15. ...... Bc5+ - develops with a time gaining check.} 16. Kh1 Nxc2 {16. ....... Nxc2 - I get one of the pawns back.} 17. Rb1 Qd3 {17. ........ Qd3 - time for Glenda to mount that Nimbus 2000 and program her Satnav to take her into the enemy camp where I hope she will not get trapped.  She is safe on d3 for now and she prevents the d2 pawn from moving and tries to hem in white's dsb for as long as possible.} 18. Rd1 a6 19. Ngxe4 {19. Ngxe4 - my e pawn falls but this capture will open up the e column.  I would like to bag it first but I must a. move Fou Lenoir out of that horsie's range and b. prevent a royal fork on c5.  Bb6 kills these 2 birds with one stone.} Bb6 20. Ba4 Raf8 {20. ....... Raf8.  Moves rook out of the Jack Horner and puts pressure on the f column.  Firstly white trades off his lsb for my knight on c2.} 21. Bxc2 Qxc2 22. Nd6+ Kc6 {22. ....... Kc6 - takes evasive action and now two pawns are traded off, the most important one is the one on f4.  You will see why very soon.} 23. Nxc4 Rxf4 24. Ne5+ Kb7 {24. ...... Kb7 - more evasive action from Henry.} 25. Nf3 Qd3 {25. ....... Qd3 - I do not wish to get Glenda trapped by d3 or d4.} 26. b4 {26. b4?? - desperate to get his bishop out but this move allows a sac on f3.  If accepted it will be curtains for the WK, do you see how?} Rxf3 27. Ba3 {27.  Ba3 - at last this bishop develops but now I develop my final piece to deadly effect ......} Rhf8 28. h3 {28. h3 - creating luft for his king but I have a nasty surprise up my sleeve.} Rxh3+ {28. ...... Rxh3+!! - another sacrifice which cannot be declined.  I now announce mate next move on Dave and he decided to allow it.  So the WK avoids being mated on the back row only to be caught in the corridor!  After those two dismal recent Expert and Master defeats this really does give me something to smile about!} 29. gxh3 Qxh3# {}
