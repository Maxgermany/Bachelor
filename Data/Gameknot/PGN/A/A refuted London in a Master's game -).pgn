[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation (D00)"]

1. d4 {In blitz you see players with "ridicolous" ratings. Be aware of them: some are very good, and I have no idea why have those ratings. The nick is not the real one, of course, but the rating is about the same. It was a very intense and (for my standards) interesting game. The nature of the endgame remembered me so much of a tennis game, with all its emotion, game after game, with the one to check as the "server" of the "game"... it was very funny, I hope you like it. } d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3 Nbd7 5. c3 {Waiting for Bd6 - Ne5. } Be7 {More accurate, in my view, than Bd6, but it must be said that Bd6, BxB, cxB is not necessarily bad for black - the pawns in the center are very strong. Passive but not weak position. } 6. h3 {Preparing g4 and the thematic assault. } b6 {This is a slow plan, which gives me tempo to...} 7. g4 {I have to be very aware of any assistance of the d4 pawn to an exchange in e5, now, since it will allow d4 by black, opening the weak white diagonal. } Bb7 8. Ne5 {All the same. My queen must be able to avoid Nh4 and go to g4-h5 herself in order to attack. } Bd6 {I'd prefer c5, but probably black is already planning to castle queenside. } 9. g5 {The attack starts here. } Ne4 {Only one. I'm not in a hurry to kick this N, I just seized...} 10. Qh5 g6 {Now I can make him worry a bit with...} 11. Qh6 {I calculated I had no risk of a trapped queen, here. If Bf8, Qh5, Bf8... I'll have to figure aout an alternate plan! :-). But in doing that, I went distracted from the hidden threat of d4 I spoke you to before.} Bxe5 {No use to go Bxe4, due to NxB, and we are at the same point. } 12. dxe5 {This keeps the dsb closed and useless for a good while. Black is managing very well the position. } Qe7 {Making room for o-o-o and leaving very few of my Queen's sortie. I fell in my own trick, now it will be very hard to survive. I'll have to improve my attack schemes with the London in sight of this game. } 13. f3 {A little barrier against Blsb. } Nec5 14. Bb5 {? I spotted something about pinning his N, but it was a fantasy. I hoped in c6, further blocking his own bishop, but black didn't fall for that line. Of course. } a6 {Well: Getting back the B was as to admit my mistake. Let's see what about...} 15. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {Good, since now black threats Qb5, and Nd2, which means I lost the b2 pawn and not in a good way. I played "hope chess", and found myself really compromised. } 16. Qg7 {This was the only downside of black's move: I can try to "do something" with my queen. } O-O-O {Ok, too late, it can't be avoided, but...} 17. Nd2 {...if the BQ leaves to attack me, I'll take some revenge on f7 and then e6. Better than nothing!} Nd3+ {After Nxb2, it's very hard to survive. I'm lost!} 18. Ke2 Nxf4+ {? White made me a favour, but it has its venom: now the Q can get in. } 19. exf4 d4 {?! Interesting! I expected Qb5+, winning b2, but this can be even worse!} 20. Rhd1 {I kind of welcome d3+!} dxc3 {This is one of those situations in which you want your game NOT to be a blitz! } 21. bxc3 {Everything falls, but I couldn't see clearly trough Nb3, cxb2, RxQ, b2xR=Q... can you?} Qd3+ 22. Ke1 {Bxf6 and it's over...} Qxc3 {?! Again interesting and unexpected. Bxf6 was now even worse, with the N being pinned against the king. Ke7 was called for, and Ra-c1 could be interesting, too, but I wanted to defend my game scheme, and then, "banzai like", returned him the tempo to play Bxf3 (ta-taaaan! coup de scene :-) and played...} 23. Qxf7 {Now, may Gods spare me...} Rxd2 {!? Again: was I spared or not? Note than now, Ra-c1 is met by RxRd1++, KxRd1, Bxf3+, and mate in few moves. } 24. Qxe6+ {Throwing in an useless check. } Kb8 25. Rxd2 {Accepting to play with a round piece less, but with a strong passed pawn. } Qxa1+ 26. Ke2 Qc3 27. Rd3 {Probably, black just can't believe he can force nothing in this position, and thinks he sees a trick in...} Bxf3+ {...KxB, QxR+. But...} 28. Rxf3 {Ops! Black jus blundered his advantage for a doubled pawn! It happens. The position was not easy, the game was full of tension, and our clocks began to press us (yellow zone). } Qc2+ 29. Ke3 Rd8 {The correct waw to threaten and grab squares. Black is still with the edge (material is now 0!)} 30. Qb3 {It won't be easy, but after a Q swap, the engame is still interesting (for my limited endgame experience!).} Qc5+ {Black tries to make me go wrong, based on time pressure. } 31. Ke2 Qg1 32. Rf1 Qg2+ 33. Rf2 Rd2+ {I accept the R swap. My Q is still eyeing g7, and soon it will be my turn. } 34. Kxd2 Qxf2+ 35. Kd1 {Only thing: I must be careful he cannot fork K and f4 unles my Q can interpose safely. I don't know if it was possible at all, but surely not with this move!} Qd4+ {Gloam. } 36. Ke2 Qxf4 {Ok, down again. My turn, now.} 37. Qg8+ Kb7 38. Qd5+ Ka7 39. e6 {,,,pushing a pawn and defending two others, plus promotion minus two... this reminds me of Federer-Wawrinka, in the las Masters...} Qh2+ 40. Ke1 {Qxh3+ must be avoided. A tempo is more important than a pawn, here!} Qg1+ 41. Ke2 Qh2+ 42. Ke1 Qg1+ 43. Ke2 Qh2+ 44. Kd1 {It was too tempting to go on playing. I'll swap Q and see what will happen. } Qg1+ 45. Kc2 Qf2+ 46. Kb3 Qe3+ 47. Kb2 {I wanted my K in a3, in order to block the check with Qb3. It was the safest way for my pawns. } Qe2+ 48. Ka3 Qe3+ 49. Qb3 {Accomplished! Now black can't swap Q or e6 reaches e8.} Qc5+ 50. Kb2 Qe5+ {Black can now take g5 and stop my pawn to go further. I'm still one step to death!} 51. Kc2 Qe4+ 52. Kc1 Qf4+ 53. Kc2 Qxg5 {It was unavoidable. Now, it's my turn again. Another game starts, I'm serving :-)} 54. Qc3 {I threaten c2, offering e6. I was kind of desperate, you know, and with no time to think. } Qf5+ {Here he goes. I will be able to draw the game, in case of emergency. } 55. Kb2 Qxe6 56. Qxc7+ Ka8 57. Qxh7 {One less. Black can't take any other pawn from me, now. I am -1. It could be worse, but it's all about technique!} Qe5+ 58. Kb3 Qd5+ 59. Kb2 Qd4+ 60. Kb3 Qd3+ 61. Kb2 {I would accept a draw, here, but I wanted to play the "technical" part of the game. } a5 62. Qg8+ Kb7 63. Qf7+ Ka6 64. Qe6 {?Qf6 would have prevented g5, a step forward for black. } Qd2+ 65. Kb1 g5 {My serve again, a game down. } 66. Qc4+ Ka7 67. Qc7+ Ka6 68. Qc4+ Kb7 69. Qe4+ Kc7 70. Qe5+ Kc6 71. Qe6+ {I wouldn't have swapped Q, but I wanted him to dance to my music. } Kc5 72. Qe7+ Kd4 {... and hope for a mistake. Here it is?} 73. Qd6+ {K must protect Q. } Ke3 74. Qxb6+ {...and I can grab another pawn! Now we are ! 0 again ! Tie break!} Kf3 75. Qf6+ Kg3 76. Qe6 {If he goes for h3, almos sure I can get a5. } Qd3+ 77. Kb2 Qb5+ 78. Kc1 {??? My turn to blunder and return the courtesy "UNFORCED MISTAKE" , they would say! :-)} Qf1+ {Forking my poor h3. } 79. Kc2 Qxh3 80. Qe3+ Kh4 81. Qd4+ Qg4 82. Qh8+ Qh5 83. Qd8 {No point in trying a perpetual. I have now to return the serve to him, and my plan will be to threat a5 wih my king the same way he did with h3. } Qe2+ 84. Kb3 Qe3+ 85. Ka4 Qc5 {Black returns the serve to my field, having secured a mate threat on b4. } 86. Qd1 {...and it slipped here, and it was the last "unforced error", except that it was in the match point ball! Otherwise, black would have won anyway, in the end... with correct play! What do you think?} Qb4# {}
