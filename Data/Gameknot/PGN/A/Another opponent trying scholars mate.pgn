1. e4 {I seen that and thought he's probably going to try scholars mate} c5 {I did that just in case he tries D4} 2. Bc4 {just as expected Bc4to attack the F7 square} Nc6 {so I brought my knight out so if he tried move Queen to F3 I would go Ne5 to attack both queen and bishop and protect the mating square} 3. Qh5 {but instead moves his Queen to H5 and then try and mate me on the F7 square} e6 {I went to E6 to protect the C5 Pawn but also stop checkmate} 4. Nc3 Nf6 {I then thought whilst his queen is out I would start attacking it} 5. Qf3 Ne5 {I attack it with the other Knight} 6. Qd3 {I was suprised with this as I thought he would probably move it to E2} Nxd3+ {I then took the Queen which then my opponent resigned}
