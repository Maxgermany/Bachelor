1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Bd3 {The French Defense, which I hate thoroughly. As noted, by the way I handle this. I turn it into Queens Gambit with 4. c4...} O-O 7. Nf3 {Daring, but I preferred it over 7. Nge2 dxc4 8. Bxc4 Nbd7 9. 0-0...} Qe7+ {After 7. ... Re8+ 9. Be3 Nbd7 10. c5...} 8. Qe2 Qxe2+ 9. Kxe2 {9. Bxe2 Be6 10. Ng5 Bf5 11. a3 releases tensions too early... Against Re8+, always Be3...} dxc4 10. Bxc4 Bf5 {Inaccurate. 10. ... c6, or Re8+ is correct...} 11. a3 Bxc3 12. bxc3 Nbd7 {12. ... Ne4 13. Bd2 Nd7, is obviously much stronger...} 13. Be3 Rfe8 14. Rhe1 {Better then 14. Bd3 Be4 15. Rhe1...} Rad8 15. Bd3 Bxd3+ {15. ... Be4 is safer, this is helping white to a better position...} 16. Kxd3 h6 17. Bf4 Nc5+ 18. Kc2 Ne6 19. Be5 Ng4 20. Bg3 {White has reached a fair position, with a slight advantage...} c5 {This comes too early, maybe 20. ... Nf6 21. Rb1 b6 22. Ne5 c5 is probably better...} 21. Rad1 cxd4 22. Nxd4 Nf6 {Right move, wrong timing. First 22. ... Nxd4 23. Rxd4 Nf6 24. f3 b6, is in order for black...} 23. Nb5 {A rock, in the pond... We start an attack against blacks queenside...} Rxd1 24. Rxd1 a6 25. Nd6 Re7 26. f3 {This took me a while. 26. Bh4 g5 is leading nowhere, so does 26. Be5 Ng4 27. Nf5 Re8 28. Bg3 Nc5...} Nc5 {26. ... b5 27. Be5 Ne8 28. Nf5 Rb7 29. g4...} 27. Rd2 {We do not need Re2+, now...} b6 28. Bf2 Nfd7 29. f4 {All black pieces on the queenside now. Before the dust settles, we whip up a new attack...} g6 30. g4 {Had I known now, what I will in a couple of moves, I would have played 30. f5 b5, 31. g4...} Kh7 {Probably too sharp... 30. ... Kf8, or b5 looks more solid...} 31. h4 {I regretted this, the moment I played it. Much stronger is the silent tempo 31. h3! b5 (Nc8! threatens) 32. f5!, and h4, or c4...} f6 {What after 31. ... Nf6! I overlooked this strong reply. Most problems for black are solved, since 32. g5 Nh5 holds... After 31. ... f6? (what I hoped for), it is a different ballgame... Lesson? Never speculate... } 32. h5 gxh5 33. gxh5 Re6 {Not best. The threat Nf5 can also be met by 33. ... Kg8/Kh8 34. Nf5 Re8/Re4...} 34. Kd1 {True beauty. White is preparing Rd5, by eliminating Re2 once again...} a5 {Black is losing control. 34. ... Nb3 35. Rd5 Ndc5 36. f5 (that is why 33. ... Re6 was weak) Re7 is to prefer over this...} 35. Rd5 {We keep c4 at hand, for now... Never spoil a good threat...} Na4 {Attacking c3 seems the only option... After 35. ... a4, also Bd4...} 36. Bd4 {Nice forcing move...} Ndc5 {Perhaps 36. ... Nb2+ 37. Kc2 Re2+ 38. Kb1...} 37. c4 {Not bad, but winning was 37. f5! Nb2+ 38. Kc1 Nd3+ (which ever) 32. Kd2, and probably Rxd6, Rxd6... Stupid me...} Ne4 {38. f5? Rxd6...} 38. Nxe4 Rxe4 39. Kc2 {39. f5 Rh4, doesn't look so hot now... We play no holds barred...} Rxf4 {Otherwise, surely f5... What follows, is forced...} 40. Kb3 Nc5+ 41. Bxc5 Rf3+ {41. ... bxc5 42. Rxc5 Rf3+} 42. Ka4 bxc5 43. Rxc5 Rc3 44. Kxa5 Rxa3+ 45. Kb6 Rc3 46. Rc7+ Kg8 47. c5 Rb3+ 48. Ka7 {All is tidied up. Now for the closure, 48. Kc6 f5, leads to complications...} Rc3 {More checks, will drive whites King to c8, and black is lost...} 49. c6 f5 50. Kb7 Kf8 {Black cracks, finally. More resliant, is 50. ... Rb3+ 51. Kc8 Rc3 52. Kd7 Kf7} 51. Rh7 {No doubt, in my mind...} Rb3+ 52. Ka6 Ra3+ 53. Kb6 Rb3+ 54. Kc5 Rc3+ 55. Kd5 Rd3+ {After 55. ... f4, of course c7, ..., c8Q+, Rxc8, Rh8+... But this accelerates whites attack again...} 56. Ke6 Kg8 {Spitefull. 56. ... Rc3 57. c7 Kg8...} 57. Ra7 {We can even play 57. c7 Kxh7 58. c8Q, but that is not efficient...} Re3+ {All else, leads to c6-c7-c8, and loss of blacks rook...} 58. Kxf5 Re8 {Blacks light goes dim here. Obviously, more checks will drive whites King to pawn h6, and quick mate... 58. ... Rc3 59. c7 Rc5+, is a fighting chance... White has little room for error...} 59. Kf6 {59. Rd7, probably provides a quicker win, but this is more clear... 59. ... Rf8+ 60. Kg6...} Re4 {Black gets too close to the King for comfort. After 59. ... Re1 60. c7 Rc1, white might run into eternal check... You never know...} 60. c7 Rc4 {No choice left. After 60. ... Re8 61. Rb7, snuffs out all of blacks resistance...} 61. Ke6 {White is invulnarable to checks, now. 61. ... Rc6+ 62. Kd7, followed by 63. c8Q+ Rxc8, or 61. ... Re4+ 62. Kd5, and same... Black resigns...}
