1. d4 {Since I always open this way, I did not really mind participating in a tournament called 'Queen`s Pawn'. It is not over yet, but at least one game was pretty interesting. } Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {The opening, the King`s Indian Defence, usually leads to sharp games. While White plays on the queenside, Black tries to attack the king`s flank after playing f5. I used to play this as Black for some time, but was not really glad with the outcome. Perhaps I should try it again, I am still looking for a good defence against d4...} Ne8 {I am not so sure about this move. It fits to Black`s plan, he can play f5 now, but I think he should have developed at least one more piece, played Nbd7 or 6...a5 7...Na6, planning to go to b4 and slowing down White`s attack.} 7. O-O f5 8. e5 {I decided to try to take his last active piece out of play. } Nc6 {Of course, he can`t just allow me that.} 9. Bf4 h6 10. h4 {Apparently, he wants to play g5, followed by f4 and perhaps Bg4. For some reason, I did not like that.} e6 11. a3 {Already planning a pawn storme on the Queenside.} dxe5 12. dxe5 {After 12.Bxe5 I might still have an advantage, but I decided to get Black a really bad bishop.} Bd7 13. b4 {According to my plan. I have come to the conclusion that this move was not the best one. I should have played 13.Qd2 Kg7 14.Rad1 Rf7 which leads to an even bigger advantage, considering that I would always have the possibility to play b4. However, this move is not really bad.} a5 {This was a mistake. It weakens b5, which should be pretty useful to me.} 14. b5 {And of course, I try to use this.} Ne7 {Nb8 or Na7 was better. Now Qd2 was really strong: 15.Qd2 Kh7 16.Rd1 and he can`t protect his bishop without losing another piece.} 15. c5 {Not the best one, but not bad. (Qd2...)} c6 {Of course he can`t allow my pawns just to wait here with an evil grin on their face.} 16. b6 {Actually, I think this was not the best move. I played b6 because I saw that his pieces don`t really have any good squares any more, but it closes the Queenside, which means I can`t really attack here anymore. So the game will move to the king`s flank, and who plays on the king`s flank in the King`s Indian Defense? Black. I think 16.a4 was better, since he can`t take on b5 (16...cxb5 17.axb5 and I can either attack a5 or just hope to create a free pawn. And, of course, 16.Qd2 was good, although after 16...Kh7 Rad1 he could play Nd5.} Nd5 {Of course, he moves the knight to the only good square.} 17. Qd4 {Take a look at the position. I do not have any pawn breaks, although his pieces are just terribly bad positioned. So bad, in fact, that I thought he could not really harm me any more and decided I had time. A terribly bad mistake, actually.} Rf7 {His only possibility, he has to play his bishop to e7 and g5-g4. } 18. Rfe1 {I assumed that after trading the knight I would probably get a free pawn on the e-file. But I think I should have played 18.Nxd5, because my pieces still are better and I would have got either the free pawn or could have tried to create one on the b-file.} Bf8 19. Bc4 {19.Nxd5 was much better. As far as I remember I thought I could perhaps sacrifice a piece on d5 and either play e6 or get at least a second free pawn on b6. But this won`t work, and now I will lose a tempo after taking on d5. Therefore, Bd3 was probably better, too, because it uwould have undermined his pawn structure after Nxd5 exd5 e6 and prevents g4. If he plays cxd5 I could still try to push my pawn to b5.} Rh7 {Of course he has to move his rook, because otherwise I play 20.Nxd5 cxd5 21.Bxd5 exd5 22.e5 and get the piece back. This move protects h6, too, so that he can play Be7, finally.} 20. Rab1 {Most probably I didn`t think long enough at this point, just thinking on a perhaps occuring free pawn on b6 (which wouldn`t have mattered due to Rb8) and just losing a tempo, in fact. I probably thought: 'He can`t harm me, anyway.' Actually, he could. Therefore, 20.Nxd5 followed by 21.Bd3 was much better.} Ng7 {Defending e6 against a possible e6-push, and preventing Nxd5. } 21. Nxd5 {I made the right decision, finally, to get rid of his annoying Nd5, but just as I wrote, he prevented this move by 20...Ng7. Therefore, 21.Nxd5 was a blunder, just got him an extra pawn.} exd5 22. Bd3 {Of course, I don`t want to lose my bishop, but now he has a  fork.} Ne6 23. Qe3 Nxf4 24. Qxf4 Bxc5 {At this point, I have to confess I was pretty angry with myself. In the beginning my position was much better, and it ended just being a pawn down.} 25. e6 {Of course, the loss of the pawn was just a brilliant sacrifice, because now I have got the free pawn on e6, which is only prevented from promoting by... two bishops, two rooks and a Queen. Yes, really brilliant. But I was a pawn down, I had to attack, and his bishop is less dangerous on e8 or c8.} Be8 26. h5 {Finally, I got a possibility to break up the position, but I would have needed it earlier... } Bd6 {I`m not sure if this was a good idea. Of course, he is getting my Queen away, but she still has a good place on d4. I assume 26...Bxa3 was better, although it looks strange to place the bishop on the a-file while I am attacking. But after 26...Bxa3 27.hxg6 Bxg6 28.Bxf5 Bxf5 he is still a pawn up and I don`t think I have much compensation... 26...Bxb6 loses due to 27.hxg6 Bxg6 28.e7 Rxe7 29.Rxe7 Qxe7 30.Rxb6  -} 27. Qd4 Qe7 {I have to admit, I do not really get this one. I assume he just wanted to prevent e7, which would be a bad idea, anyway.} 28. hxg6 Bxg6 29. Nh4 {Now I get the pawn back.} Rg7 30. Bxf5 {I thought quite a long time about how to take, but I decided to play Bxf5 because I win a tempo (he can`t retake due to the fork on f5). } c5 {This move is a bad mistake, the decisive mistake, in fact. His position would still be pretty good after 30...Bh5. But he is attacking my queen, and, of course, I will move it?} 31. Nxg6 {Take my queen and I`ll take yours. At this point, it`s already me who has the better position.} Qg5 {Preventing Qxd5, due to Rxg6, right?} 32. Qxd5 {In fact, it doesn`t.} Rxg6 {It`s only natural to take the knight, but, unfortunately, it leads to a quick loss.} 33. e7+ Kg7 {There is no better move. If 33...Kh8 then e8R   -, if 33...Kh7 then 34.Qf7  Kh8 35.Qxg6.} 34. e8=Q {Finally, the pawn is promoted.} Rxe8 35. Rxe8 {At this point he resigned. He can`t prevent 36.Rg8  Kh7 37.Qf7# without massive losses of material, and he is a rook down, anyway.  This game was interesting, I think, because of many opportunities to win a very good position, and a desperate try to attack after missing them and even getting into trouble.  Anyway, thanks for reading :)}
