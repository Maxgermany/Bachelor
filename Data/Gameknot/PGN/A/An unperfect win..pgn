1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 5. Be2 Bc5 {First move out of schemes. I tried this some times, well knowing that d4 comes, and then Bb6 makes me lose a tempo... but I solve the dsb's dev problem, and if ever white wants to play d5, my B would be looking at f7. He can take it, true, but that implies white to exchange Nc3...} 6. Nf3 {Premature is ...Ng4, after o-o white seems fine. But this is the kind of position Tal could win by sactifying two queens... (say, after h3, h5! and this kind of things).} c6 {Much better than Nc6, in my view. Opens squares for my dsb and Q, blocksa any N or Bb5 attempt, and prepares to support Nf6 with Nd7. } 7. O-O Nbd7 8. d4 {Finally. I was waiting for it. } Bb6 {...or Bb4, being prepared to exchange it. But it is a bad plan. } 9. Bg5 {Expected, also. Not dangerous now to move the Q. } Qc7 10. Ne5 {Now I have a chance to castle either Q or K side. I play for fun, and I don't like "even looking positions", if I can avoid them. I have to be smarter. Now, I thought a long time before playing...} O-O-O {Probably not holdable against a good player. But... } 11. Na4 {An innocent plan. I can leave him the B and play for the reason I castled Q side: NxN. And this would have been good enough. But I figured a crazy plan to get something more from the situation, as the pawn d4. I realized that I coud take it, since after QxB, NxN would have got the same result, but with white dislocated, wide opened in the center, ect. etc. I didn't want to allow NxB+ plainly. } Bxd4 12. Bxf6 {White interposes a move, and I dont' want to add the exchange to the bargain, so I took... what do you think is the right take?} gxf6 {...maybe, opening a valuable column against white!} 13. Qxd4 {Finally, white decides to take.} Nxe5 {? I take back winning a tempo and grabbing control of the white squares white's lsb can reach. But I lost of sight of a simple but dangerous fact. } 14. Qxa7 {Uh-oh. I have to cope with... Nb6! How?} Nd7 {Only saving move!} 15. Rad1 {After RxN, the threat is still "on"!} b5 {I calculated that I had to force the situation before white does. If Qa8+, Nb8 and all I can see for white are exchanges. At least, I hoped so!} 16. Rxd7 Rxd7 {Bxd7, Qa8+, ...Qb8, Nb6+ black is dead, so I preferred to give up the exchange...   } 17. Nb6+ Kd8 {...which I am not doing, actually! Can you see why?} 18. Nxd7 {Uh-oh! Had to perform the Qa8+...Qb8, QxQ+...KxQ, NxR sequence before, and this small step meant the loss of the game for him. } Qxa7 19. Nxf6 Ke7 20. Ne4 Rg8 {I didn't even look at the a1 pawn. } 21. a3 Bh3 22. Bf3 Bg4 {Forcing a B's exchange in my favour. But I wanted more fun. } 23. Nd2 Qc5 {I wanted to take the B for free, or playing trying to achieve it. Like this. Or Qd4 (but it allows the white's dsb to land on c6...). This allows...} 24. Re1+ Kf8 {...and my bet is that square will be safe enough!} 25. c3 Qd6 {Not wanting to leave c6 unguarded.} 26. Re2 {Ne4 seemed more natural, but it will be played later.} Qf6 {Now I am threatening the white B. He doesn't want to exchange, knowing the game will be even worse...} 27. Ne4 Qf5 {Keeping the pressure and preventing Nd6 because of Qb1+ and mate! Be aware of Nd6 threatens Re8#! I can still lose, and in an humilliating way!} 28. Kf1 {That leaves me almost no choice. } Bxf3 29. gxf3 Qxf3 {Now, again, if Nd6, Qh1#...} 30. Ng3 {How to finish white the best possible way?} Qd3 31. Ke1 Qb1+ 32. Kd2 Qxb2+ 33. Kd3 Qxa3 34. Nf5 {I went for a slow way, pretty sure I could keep control of everything while I keep control of Ne6.} f6 {...so I released me from that chain... it was enough!} 35. h3 Rg5 36. Nd4 b4 {Still trying to go faster, I oversee...} 37. Ne6+ Kg8 {I have to prevent another check!} 38. Nxg5 Qxc3+ {The honour was saved, at least! :-D} 39. Ke4 {No point in keeping fooling aroud with checks. The Q with a pawn, alone, can't do much, but helping white to eventually save the N. Better is to keep the pawns together and seal white's fate...} fxg5 {never better, because the white R is closed in.} 40. Re3 Qc4+ 41. Kf3 Qf4+ 42. Kg2 c5 {Now is a piece of cacke.} 43. h4 Qxh4 44. Rg3 Qe4+ 45. f3 Qe2+ 46. Kh3 h6 47. Kg4 Qe6+ 48. Kh5 Kh7 49. f4 Qe2+ 50. Rg4 Qh2+ 51. Rh4 Qxh4# {Some tricks (like satemate) were still possible if I played carelessly!}
