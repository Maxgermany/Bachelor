[Opening "QGD Slav (D11), 3.Nf3"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 dxc4 4. e3 Bg4 {Strange decision to play this move. For instance, all white has to do is to capture on c4 with the bishop, and he has already the threat Qb3. The light squared bishop is poorly placed. In this opening, we will see that simply following the fundamental(and mistakenly called "beginner" or "basic") principles, we can find the BEST move in each of the positions quickly. Here, black should have played ...Nf6, getting the least active piece. I should also note that without any calculation, this move is not best The bishop was already active, so we shouldn't move it again.} 5. Bxc4 e6 {It's a necessary move to make. Now white should simply castle or play Nc3, but we can also do the move h3, which should be best, putting the question to the bishop. } 6. O-O {Perhaps castling will put white under an annoying pin, but it is only annoying. White probably will not even care if ...Bxf3 ruins the structure, since he will be getting bishop pair, open file for the rook, and a boost in center control. It will suit him fine.} Bd6 {Once again, we should have simply played with the least active piece Nf6. Really, we can find the best moves in one second if we just use the base principles. Who knows, maybe this bishop would like to go to e7. In that case, there is an issue of flexibility as well.} 7. Nbd2 {Once again, the most active forward move is Nc3, so we should simply do it. } Nf6 {Black has played a good opening, but his pieces are not the best in placement, and are a bit vulnerable. However, we have seen a simple, modest development of forces, so we cannot make a real criticism.} 8. b3 {White now needed to play the move of 8.e4 with a good position. If the move of e5 gets to happen, a piece will be lost, and white will have a permanent space advantage in the kingside(at least for the whole middlegame, good for an attack). Not only that, black could not even have played move of 8...e5 9.dxe5 Bxe5 10.Bxf7+ and white is simply winning. I should also mention that the move e4 would free the dark squares bishop.} Qc7 {Now black has a great game, since white has not taken the key moment. He already has a threat.} 9. g3 {I would not have played this move. It weakens the kingside light squares, and is just making too great of a concession on the kingside. At least, if a kingside weakening is called for, play h3 instead, and Bh2+ gives black nothing.} O-O {Good idea, and black already has snatched opening edge, at the very least equality.} 10. Bd3 {We should not move the pieces twice when we should develop. In fact, white should still sieze the chance of e4, with a good game still. Here black can safely answer with e5.} Bb4 {Not the best move. It has a clear idea to stop the white development of his dark squared bishop, but white can easily stop the idea. He should have simply played Nbd7, then considered a choice break move, of e5 probably, but c5 could also be possible in some lines.} 11. Ne4 {White needs to move his piece again to free himself, and the move is actually not so bad.} Nxe4 {When there is a contact between the pieces, we should keep it up unless it gives us a real tactic. Usually, releasing the tension gives the opponent activity. Now black has lost his defensive knight on the kingside, while white has freed himself nicely. Black should have played Nbd7.} 12. Bxe4 Bh3 {It fails to a tactical shot, which to white's credit, he finds. Many players rated in that area would not be able to find the move.} 13. Bxh7+ {The only move, and black is now having a major disadvantage in both lines. } Kxh7 {Even worse for black would have been 13...Kh8 14.Ng5} 14. Ng5+ Kg8 15. Qh5 {And now we get a very important lesson. If you have a good winning move that gives you great advantage and an unclear line(Of course the unclear line is just losing), that simply take the great advantage. I suppose that white expected the move ...Rc8. If white checks, it is actually not so clear anymore, and white needs to do a SERIOUS calculation. White should simply capture the bishop.} Bf5 {Of course there is the defense} 16. e4 Bg6 17. Qh4 Rd8 18. Bb2 c5 19. dxc5 Rd2 20. Rab1 Bxc5 21. Kg2 Qc6 22. a3 f6 23. Nf3 Rd3 24. b4 Bb6 25. Rfc1 Qxe4 26. Qxe4 Bxe4 27. Kh3 Nc6 28. Ne1 Rd2 29. Bc3 Rxf2 30. Rb2 Bf5+ 31. g4 Rxb2 32. Bxb2 Be3 33. Rd1 Be4 34. Rd6 e5 35. Ng2 Bxg2+ 36. Kxg2 e4 37. h4 Bf4 38. Rd7 e3 39. Kf3 Ne5+ 40. Bxe5 fxe5 41. Rxb7 Rd8 42. Rxa7 e4+ 43. Kg2 Rd2+ 44. Kf1 e2+ 45. Ke1 e3 46. Ra8+ Kh7 47. b5 Bg3# {I don't think the rest of the game needed an annotation-Black slowly converted his advantage.}
