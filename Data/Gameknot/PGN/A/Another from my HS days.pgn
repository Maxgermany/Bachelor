[White "Miss L. "]
[Black "J. B. "]
[Opening "Caro-Kann (B17), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 {She always used this move as White. We tried many counters, none of them worked.} c6 {J. B. had never played this, but he'd read in a book it was a good move, so he decided to try it.} 2. d4 {Miss L. of course formed an ideal center.} d5 {This was as much of the book as J. B. remembered. We weren't professionals and didn't try to memorize the first 10 moves of every opening variation.} 3. Nc3 {The game starts here, with the first actual piece being developed.} dxe4 {J. B. wanted to dissipate Miss L.'s center quickly.} 4. Nxe4 {Miss L. now centralizes her Knight and regains the Pawn.} Nd7 {J. B. decides to get his pieces out as well.} 5. Qe2 {Miss L. prepares for castling Q-side. But J. B. didn't see the tactical fine point this move also holds.} Ngf6 {J. B. tries to continue his development. However, it was necessary to play 5... P-K3 to prevent...} 6. Nd6# {...this! The game ends with a lightning-bolt move.}
