1. e4 {Regular standard king pawn opening } e5 {Black replies normally } 2. Qh5 {What in the world have I done.} Nc6 {Very standard development guarding the e5 pawn } 3. Bc4 {Threatening mate hopefully not though} g6 {Stopped the mate} 4. Qf3 {Threatening mate yet again and the next move is quite surprising. A mate on f7 is a Scholars Mate. I did not think of winning my 1st team match with a slightly delayed scholars mate!!!!} Nd4 {???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? I have gone crazy after this. I checked for a trick, but nope.} 5. Qxf7# {Sorry archangel_777. Delayed scholars mate}
