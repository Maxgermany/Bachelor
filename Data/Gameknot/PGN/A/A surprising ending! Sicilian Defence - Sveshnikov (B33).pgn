[Opening "Sicilian (B33), Sveshnikov variation"]

1. e4 {This is the first time I annotate one of my games. I guess it might be an interesting game, at least for someone who's rating is lower than mine. It might as well sound ridiculous for a very experienced player.} c5 {This game was part of a mini-tournament with the title: Play your favourite variation of the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nf3 {I must not forget to say that this game was my second one against "gastanf "(Larry, the team captain of Atlanta House) and that he had won the first one brilliantly. Forgive me if I choose to annotate the game I've won rather than the lost one...} Nc6 {Larry is a strong player even if his rating might be a few points lower than mine. Also, after my first defeat I already would have been happy to achieve a draw in the second one.} 3. d4 {I'm heading for the Sveshnikov which is my favorite variation of the Sicilian when playing black. The characteristic move is  5.) ...e5. I won't tell you more about this opening as you can find better explanations in books.} cxd4 {Also, I will leave you alone till move 19, when I finally deviate from the Gameknot data base.} 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 {If you think Qxf6 is better, look at the results shown in the Gameknot data base (in this case white wins 79% of the games).} 10. Nd5 f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Nc2 Be6 14. Nce3 Ne7 15. Be2 Nxd5 16. Nxd5 O-O 17. O-O Rb8 18. a4 bxa4 19. Rxa4 {Here my predecessor (the only one left at this point and always according to the gameknot data base) played 19.) ...Rxb2,  20.) Bxa6, which did not show very good results. So I decide to keep my a pawn for a while and try to keep the a file closed.} a5 {My first own move in this game!} 20. b4 axb4 21. Rxb4 Kh8 {Makes place - eventually - for Rg8 and prevents the risk of check when the white queen eventually comes to d5 (after ...Bxf5, Qxd5).} 22. Qd3 f5 {Because I plan to push forward my f pawn anyway. Whites move aimed at h7 and} 23. Rfb1 {gave way for 23.) Rf-b1 which doubles the rooks on the b-file.} Rxb4 24. cxb4 {Now white has a very dangerous passed pawn supported by his rook. At this point, my reasoning was: Should I try to attack the passed pawn? I guess I would have ended up with a very defensive play. So I opted for a kingside attack, hoping it would be strong enough before white's b-pawn arrives on the b8 square.} e4 {Makes way for the bishop winning the tempo. Maybe white's 22.) Qd3 wasn't so good after all.} 25. Qd1 Be5 26. b5 {The b-pawn on his way, like the sword of Damocles (for those who know the ancient Greek legend or at least The Rocky Horror Picture Show...)} Qg5 {But the kingside attack is also on her way.} 27. g3 f4 28. Bf1 {I guess Larry defends rather well.} fxg3 29. hxg3 Bxg3 {In such situations I guess you simply HAVE to sacrifice a piece, if it allows to destroy the king's defense .} 30. fxg3 {Now I had planned 30. ...Qxg3 , 31. Kh1 Rf2 and black wins. Only in the very last moment, I have realized that unfortunately, after 30. ...Qxg3, white has Bg2 and Larry is only waiting for it!} Bxd5 {Happily, I can grab the knight and now I'm one pawn up.} 31. Qd4+ {Tears the king out of his corner. Bye bye the hope of doubling on the g file with ...Rg8.} Kg8 32. Bg2 {Attacks the pawn on e4, the Bd5 (indirectly),  protects the kings position and finally this is the best diagonal for white's Bishop.} Rb8 {I want to bring my king in the game which is impossible with the rook on f8, because after 32. ...Kf7, 33. Rf1  and the exchange of the rooks, I guess the passed pawn would win the game.} 33. b6 {Which is still on his way anyway.} Kf7 {The only piece I have to make my position stronger. Dangerous, because my king gets exposed. But at least one piece more.} 34. Rf1+ {ok, ok...} Ke6 35. Qf2 Ke5 {very well centralized isn't it?} 36. Qb2+ {Not for very long. } Ke6 {This is the only move.} 37. Qd4 {Now white has centralized his queen.} h5 {I was hoping for white to grab the e pawn with 38. Bxe4, after which black can play ...Qxf3 , 39. Kh1 Qh4  winning the bishop with 40. Kg1 Bxe4. But of couse Larry is too clever. Still, the h pawn moving up might be a threat for the white's king position later on.} 38. Bh3+ {Larry has his own attack in mind. One should always look out for possible checks that the opposant has in hand. I had totally missed this one.} Ke7 {The only move if I don't want to loose my queen.} 39. Qc3 {Simply threatening Qc7 , winning black's rook and, I guess, mating soon afterwards. } Rb7 {What else could I do?} 40. Bc8 {Now the rook has no place to go and white seems to have won the game, but...} e3 {this move threatens Qxg3  (the pawn is no longer protected by the queen), it also opens the diagonal for black's Bishop (finally! and only because white's bishop has given up this diagonal for the purpose of his own attack). And of course: threatens mate.   } 41. Qe1 {Protects pawn g3, but now black can take the pawn on b6, which once was white's greatest pride.} Rxb6 {At this moment I thought: Ok, not only I am 2 pawns up, but also one of them has reached the third rank, white's king is still in danger and I have all my time to advance my pawns. I had not at all foreseen Larry's next move:} 42. Rf5 {the rook is protected by the bishop on c8. After chasing the queen he threatens to win the bishop, and if black defends with  42. ...Qg8, white can take the pawn on e3 with check keeping his own pawn protected and threatening to take black's rook on b6. So after 43. Qxe3  Be6, black still might have an advantage, but is only 1 pawn up. But black has a better solution:} Rb1 {Now ironically none of black's pieces is protected and white can simply take the rook on b1, keeping his own rook protected by both the bishop and the queen. But: After 43. Qxb1 follows 43. ...Qxg3 , 44. Kf1 (the only move), and white has no defense against 44. ...Bc4 , 45. Qd3 Bxd3 mate. Whereas after 43. Rxg5 follows 43. ...Rxe1 , 44. Kh2(only move) Rh1 mate. A surprising end, isn't it? Hope you enjoyed it a little and you don't mind my bad english... Good luck wherever you are! }
