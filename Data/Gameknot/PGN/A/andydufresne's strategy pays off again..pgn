1. d4 {Hello,  If you read my other annotation "Willingness to change tactics..." then you will recognize this as a sort of continuation on that same theme.  This game embodies a strategy that was brought to my attention through the annotations of andydufresne.  I'm sure that he isn't the first to describe or think of this, but I feel the need to give him props for turning me onto it as it has helped me in many games since.  This game is just one of the more successful examples of turning initial won material into an actual win.  Disclaimer: There were many irrational moves made on the part of my opponent (and on my part also), which made this win a little easier then it could have been, but that's part of chess isn't it?  Taking advantage of your opponents blunders or lacks in judgement.  So please, no comments about how these tactics would not have worked on someone who knew what they were doing.  Amazingly enough there are people out there that actually know less about chess than I do.  This is mainly for those people who are  at my level or below.  My hope is that due to my stated lack of technical knowhow about the game I might be able to offer some sort of understanding in a language that they can understand if for no other reason that I am working within the same scope of understanding as they are.  This is more of an excercise for me and also it may help someone of equal or lesser skill than I realize something they have never thought of before about chess strategy. Hopefully, it will help me understand mine and my oppents play a little better also. :)} d5 2. e3 {I thought this was a fairly weak opening, for the fact that there are a lot other recognized moves that will give White more initiative.  moving the King's Pawn up 2 spaces instead of 1 would be the obvious choice if you're going to move that particular pawn.} Nf6 {I moved this Kt because it's a standard developing move and it doubled my attack on e4, which becomes one of the central squares of the game.} 3. b4 {?? This seems like a wasted move to me, it puts a hanging pawn out there and doesn't do anything to attack the center squares.  The only possible move I could see following this would be a bishop move.. but he shouldn't have pushed it out so far.   It's as if he confused his 2nd and 3rd pawn move.  The e pawn should have been pushed out 2 spaces, while the b pawn only should have gone out 1, if he was in fact planning a fiancetto.} Bf5 {I chose to move my bishop to f5 for the reason of   1) developing another piece and 2)tripling the pressure on the e4 square  Admittedly I didn't really know what was going on at this point, I was just trying to establish a firm hold on the center while my oppenent was giving me free moves.} 4. Bd3 {Finally an move that offers some sort of purpose...} e6 {This is the point when I began thinking, once again, about andydufresne's strategy of turning an extra pawn into a win.   By moving my pawn here, I protect my Bishop and also open up an oppurtunity to  capture his hanging b pawn with my black squared bishop.} 5. g4 {This is one of those moves that made winning with andy's strategy fairly easy...} Nxg4 {Free pawn for me!  And as a bonus, not only was I able to get some free material, but now I had some pressure on his weak f2 square.} 6. h3 Qh4 {this is probably one of my favorite moves of the game... All it took was one wrong move from White and he would be mated with Qxf2.  Alas the game was not to be won so easily (which is good because what fun is an easy win right?) ;)  Also White can not take my Kt without losing his rook:  PxKt QxRk  Which would put him in a world of hurt.} 7. Qe2 {I believe that this was a solid move and was the catalyst for changing the game into something else entirely.  At this point, I was still entertaining the idea that I might be able to still make some sort of devestating blow to white's defence, and it's very likely that I missed some great replies on my part.} g6 {I had never taken my eyes off of White's hanging b pawn which would allow me to also put White in check.  But at this point I was trying to set up an exchange of Queens.  I was willing to trade Queens (or anything) at this point as long as I kept my  1 lead in material, however with this move I was hoping to set up a situation whereby I might actually gain additional material over white.   My basic plan was this:  ..p a6  planning... ..Kt c6 ..p e5  The p a6 is a protective measure for my Kt move.  while white's hanging b Pawn is a weakness for him right now, if I move my Kt to c6 he could move his pawn to b5 ruining all my plans.  the Kt c6 is move is designed to put coverage on the e5 square (to protect my future pawn move)  The pawn is then moved to e5 in order to initate more piece exchanging, while the current move you're looking at continues to provide protection for my bishop.  Additionaly I was thinking that with everything else it accomplished, moving my Kt would give me the ability to 0-0-0.  } 8. Nf3 {However, this move changed all of those plans (perhaps only temporarily).    I figured this would happen very soon, but I was hoping that he would overlook it a few more moves.} Bxb4+ {Here I decided to go ahead and take his hanging pawn, known that he would probably either move his pawn to c3.} 9. c3 {as expected.  Now I'm up  2 in material, but my bishop and Queen are under attack.  Perhaps the old me would have moved my Queen to e7 in order to retake the pawn and put white in check again.    However, thanks to Andy I was now thinking of other things besides saving material or putting my opponent in check.} Bxd3 {I the oppurtunity here to snag his bishop.  This is a sort of strange tactic for me, and probably for a lot of you watching because now I have put 3 pieces in danger!  Am I crazy!?  I don't think so.  Keep in mind that White is still one move away from being mated.  With this move, I continue to postpone his plans to take my Queen unless he would like to trade Queens, which most players that I play (read: of my ranking) are unwilling to do unless they have no other choice.  I'm remember White's first few moves and so it's not a far stretch to assume that maybe he will take the bait and recapture with his Queen, allowing me to checkmate.    His only other options are to take my Queen with his Knight allowing me to take his Q with my bishop.. he would take back with his King (regaining his bishop and I would still be up my 2 points in material.  This move also put his b1 Kt in danger of being captured, which would allow me to gain a Bishop and a Knight for the price of 1 bishop.  Not a bad deal eh?  His only other viable option would be to move to d2..} 10. Qd2 {Being that I was pretty sure he was fully aware of the mate threat at f2 I guessed correctly that he would move here, which still allows him to protect the f2 square and at the same time get his Queen out of danger.} Qxf2+ {I saw no other option at this point that would postpone the inevitable and if I wasn't careful I was going to start losing pieces for no good reason (I have 3 under attack).  This forces him into a Queen exchange, which I'm sure he hated.} 11. Qxf2 Nxf2 12. Kxf2 {He regains his 3 points for the bishop he lost, but he ended up trading a Pawn and a Queen for Queen, meaning that I gained an additional pawn.  Ideally I think I would want to trade Knights for Knights and Bishops for Bishops, but at this point I'm just experimenting with raw points (this is more clearly demonstrated later in the game).} Bd6 {Now, I'm able to get my Black bishop out of danger.  I chose this square to move to only after some debate.  I still had a pretty good control over e4 and I decided my best plan of action was to try and secure some kind of control over the other diagnal.  At the moment I'm not able to wrest control of the longest black diagnal (a1-h8), but the h1-b3 was free so I opted for that one.  I had some plans here that involved p f6, but I don't remember what point that served.. my apologies.} 13. Rg1 {This was a bright move on the part of white as my next move was going to be to pin his Kt to his Rk.  I would have liked to done that and then trade (again) bishop for Kt only this time the other way around, so that the world was right again.  But he saw through this obvious ploy, although I'm not sure that he was onto my actual motives yet.  } Bxb1 {However, Moving his rook couldn't protect the still threatened b1 Kt and I captured} 14. Rxb1 {Now, I'm up  3 in material.   This is where those pawns really start to add up!} b6 {I have to move my pawn out here in order to avoid losing one of my own pawns to Rkxb7, which would bring my material lead down to  2 and that would just be silly.} 15. Bd2 {? connecting his rooks?  I'm not sure what his plan was here...} f6 {I do know that he has a pawn at d4 however that is incapable of moving.  My plan is to move ...pe5 so as to initate an even pawn trade.  Whether I take first or he does is inconsequential.        ... pd5 pxp ... pxp  and I'm in pretty good position to then move ...pe4 and put some pressure on his Kt and also start getting my pawn into uncomftorable territory.  The more serious implication of this is that now the f file is opened up and  simple rook move will pin his Kt to his King, very unpleasent.  And if I take first then he'll just retake} 16. Rge1 {?  again.. I have no idea.. I guess he's probably sensing that I'm about to attack his d pawn and wants to have some sort of support on the e file?  I really don't know at this point.} Nc6 {This may have been a wasted move on my part as I could have easily moved p e5 at this point to initiate the exchange.   I made this move on the chance that White would continue to give me free moves.  If so, then I could move pe5 on my next move while giving it triple support and also attacking the d4 square.} 17. e4 {Now I see what he was up to.  He wants to take my d pawn which forks my Knight and e Pawn, and I can't recapture because my e pawn will be pinned to my King.} O-O-O {Thankfully I moved my Knight ;) which meant I cectould 0-0-0 to my still reasonably protected Queen side.  This unpinned my King which meant I retake his pawn in the event of pxd5 which would be fine with me because it would be an equal exchange.} 18. e5 fxe5 {I have no problem taking this..   Mainly because I misread the board.  For some reason I thought that if:  pxp I could reply with bxP  and after Ktxb .. KtxKt I would come out on top, but I forgot about his Rook up there at e1.} 19. dxe5 Be7 {I retreat, just happy not to have followed this horrible line any farther and also get out with a pawn for pawn even trade.  Also, I saw the oppurtunity here to disguise a tactical move as a retreating move.  I had noticed a few moves back that he had put his King on the same Dark diagnal as his Rook, which screamed "Pin ME!!", so here I have the chance to move bh4 and trade a bishop for a Rook.  I'll have to figure out how to get rid of the Kt at f3 first though because it is protecting the h4 square that I would need to move my bishop to in order to get the pin.} 20. Ke2 {Busted..  For all the weird moves white made towards the beginning of this game, he suddenly has become very observant.  This move removes the threat of me pinning his King to his rook.} d4 {I'm still trying to trade pieces off the board.  If he captures my pawn with his I can capture his pawn my Kt putting White's King in Check.  pxp .. Ktxd4   At that point white is left with the choice of Taking back with his Kt which I in turn take with my rook even exchanges all around.  Or, he can move his King out of the way and I will take his Knight.. still even. (well.. me  3)  The other main choice he has is to do something else totally unrelated, at which point I can move my pawn up to d3 to put him in check (my pawn is protected by my rook).  Ideally this will have the effect of chasing him right back onto that Dark diagnal where my bishop can go after the pin (after I get rid of the Kt of course).} 21. c4 {Not the choice I thought he would make, but maybe he's wise to my plan.} d3+ {Not one of the choices I thought he would make, but it allows me to excute my contengiency plan of moving my pawn up to check.  } 22. Kf2 {I really thought he would put his King at d1 so as to avoid this situation again of having his rook pinned.  Although moving to d1 presents a lot of problems in and of itself because from d1 as long as my pawn stays at d3 he can not move anywhere except for c1 which could probalby be comprimised a number of ways.  I don't know them, nor do I care to figure them out at this point.  Needless to say, white was on the run at this point and I was still up on material.} Rdf8 {this of course Pins his Knight to his King meaning that if given the chance I can now move to b4 and he can not capture with his Kt.  I should have moved my h8 Kt to this position however, as we will see in the next move.} 23. Ke3 {Problem solved eloquently by White.  This unpins both his Kt and his Rk and attacks my now undefended d pawn (doh!)} Rfd8 {Now I have to waste a move in order to reprotect my d pawn.} 24. Rbd1 {?  Maybe thinking he could move his bishop out of the way and trade a rook for a rook and a pawn.. good for me if he chooses to do that.  I could see no other dubious motives behind this move so I ignored it.} Bc5+ {this is an attempt to get him to move his King around and hopefully put it in front of something again since I screwed up the last attempt.} 25. Kf4 {It works..} h5 {here I have a couple of mean ideas.  1) restrict the number of squares his King can move to.  I assumed that he would probably try to start getting his King out of the way of trouble and I would be able to bring my bishop down to e7 and start giving him a headache.  2)A more evil plan and trap was to try and bait him into Ktg5 which has the potential of Ktf7 to fork my two rooks.. unfortunantly, if he took the bait a simple Rk(h8)f8 would pin his Kt to his King letting me get a free Kt  2a) in the even that he saw the trap (and probably would) there was also the possibility that from Ktg5 he would move Kte6 which forks my bishop and D rook and also prevents me from moving to f1 in order to check.  If he chooses that path all sorts of heartache awaits him.} 26. Ng5 {surprisingly, it appears as if he has taken the bait.} Bf2 {this is a sort of long way around to protect the h4-e8 diag.  I know that he will probably move his Rook to f1, but regardless this was just a way to postpone his Kt move and give me some initative.  also, after thinking about it I had decided that he would probably take the safer looking of the two choices with his Kt.. that being Kte6.  Being that I had a good plan for that, I wanted to get my bishop out of the fork situation.} 27. Ref1 {as expected.} Bh4 {this was my real intention with the bishop.} 28. Nxe6 {With my bishop there to help him, he chooses the better looking of the two moves... Unfortunantly for him, this was not a surprise to me.} Rde8 {This Pins his Kt to his Pawn meaning that he will either lose his pawn or his Kt.  Thanks to my h5 pawn he can not get into any position where he can  protect  c6his pawn and once he moves out of the way I can move ... Rkxe5 which puts my rook in the center of the board gaurded by my Kt at c6.  Out of the squares that he can move his Kt only 7 are available to him:  f4 is occupied by his King, so he can't move there g5 leads to bxKt Kxb.. an even exchange d4 leads to Ktxkt c5 leads to PxKt7 capture the pawn on c7 will lead to KxKt d8 and f8 lead to the obvious RkxKt and g7 lets him attack my e rook (temporarily)  This leads me to assume that he will move to g4 in order to avoid trading his Kt for anything whether it's equal or not.  One of the advantages I've noticed about this strategy is that it sort of has a nice momentum that can be built from it in the sense that the move pieces that you trade off, the more and more reluctant your oppenent becomes when it comes to trading meaning that often they spend more time trying to save their few remaining pieces then they do attacking.} 29. Be1 {Strangely he chooses none of his options and instead elects to move his bishop to e1 which attacks my bishop and  exposes my pawn to attack from his rook.  Another interesting thing I find about this strategy is that often your opponent will not realize what you are doing and think that you are in the same mindset as he (trying to save what few pieces you have left).  This move obviously says that he has no idea what it is I'm doing.} Rxe6 {I sih I had some idea why I did this.  I think at the time I was thinking I could trade a Kt for a bishop, but obviously my better move would have been Bxe1 followed by White's Rook capture of e1 and then I could have taken the Kt and been up by three more points.   This was a dumb move on my part and it made the rest of the game a little more difficult.} 30. Bxh4 {he of course takes my bishop.. and I suceed in getting my kt for bishop trade, but it cost me a quicker win because I could have had a Bishop for a Bishop and a Kt trade.} Rxe5 {and now I take his pawn putting me back at my  3 advantage.} 31. Rfg1 {attacking my weak g6 pawn.} Rg8 {protecting my weak pawn} 32. Rxd3 {and he gets my pawn.. now I'm down to  2, but I had already figured out a way to get his bishop and rook.} Rf8+ {Check.  thanks to my h5 pawn (which was moved to restrict the King's movement he can only move to g3.} 33. Kg3 g5 {This gets me his bishop as he can not run away and will probably capture my pawn just get something and I will retake with my e5 rook which will put him in check meaning he will have to move out of the way and I can take his rook.  White resigned at this point.  In the last annotation I did involving this strategy I was not actively pursuing the win this way, I was only *willing* to do it if I had to.  This game is closer to the original annotated game by andydufresne that has inspired me to look at chess from this angle in that from early on in the game my main focus was to trade off material in order to turn my intial material lead into a win.  Comments are appreciated! :)}
