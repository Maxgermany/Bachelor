1. e4 {Normal opening for me here} e5 {Normal opening for black and everyone is happy} 2. Nf3 {Carrying on with development} f6 {I prefer the queenside pawn defense } 3. Bc4 {Still carrying on unfazed. } c6 {I guess he's hoping for a d5 move next.} 4. Nc3 {Still carrying on} Na6 {Only move for that knight} 5. Nxe5 {I know this is a risky move that could easily go wrong but i was curious} fxe5 {Expected and now im thinking if that was a good idea. Surely he won't fall for it. Or will he?} 6. Qh5+ {hahaha i checked you. It now depends on his move.} Ke7 {WHAT?} 7. Qxe5# {HAHAHAHAHAHAHA what a checkmate within 7 moves. g6 would have made him live slightly longer}
