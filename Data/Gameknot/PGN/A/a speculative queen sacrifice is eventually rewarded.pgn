1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O d6 5. d3 {guioco pianissimo.. so far so boring} h6 6. a3 Nf6 7. b4 Bb6 8. b5 Nd4 9. c3 Nxf3+ 10. Qxf3 O-O {plenty of threats down black's king side but nothing to worry, let's calmly castle} 11. Qg3 {here they come the threat is Bxh6 but the best form of defence is attack.} Nh5 12. Qf3 c6 {my blunder.. can't even remember why i chose this move.} 13. Qxh5 Be6 14. Bxe6 fxe6 {that exchange suited me nicely.. but I'm still a whole piece down.. at this point I've decided that the game is pretty much lost} 15. Qg4 Qf6 16. bxc6 bxc6 17. a4 Qxf2+ {here we go, nothing to lose really. I can't see a complete way through but after Rxf2 Rxf2 ... Ra-f8 is a  strong attack. } 18. Rxf2 Rxf2 19. Qxe6+ {white must guard against discovered check with the rook attacking the queen.} Kh8 20. d4 Raf8 {white is not out of danger yet. (not by a long way!) } 21. Nd2 exd4 22. h3 {if cxd4 Bxd4 probably wins white's rook whilst h3 seems to diffuse the danger from blacks rooks.} dxc3 23. Kh2 cxd2 24. Ba3 {I think Bxd2 would probably better, giving up material but handing back the initiative to white.} Bd4 25. Rd1 Be5+ 26. Kg1 {oh dear.. only other choice here is 26. Qxe5 dxe5 27. Bxf8 Rxf8 28. Rxd2 swapping queen and bishop for bishop and rook and getting rid of that pesky seventh rank pawn} Rf2f1+ {I can exchange rooks because of Bd4 } 27. Rxf1 Bd4+ 28. Kh2 Rxf1 29. Qxd6 d1=Q {now it's pretty much all over for white} 30. Bc5 Bxc5 31. Qxc5 Qxa4 32. e5 Qf4+ 33. g3 Qd2+ {phew.. no idea how i pulled that one off. }
