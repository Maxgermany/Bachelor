[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 Nc6 {Bishop's Opening.  I'm quite fond of playing it with the White pieces, too, but here, I'm Black.} 4. Nc3 Na5 {Quite a popular line, this.  Black sacrifices a little time to bring about the exchange of the White's King's bishop for a knight.} 5. Bb3 {A 'obvious' move, if White doesn't like the pawn structure after ...Nxc4; dxc4.  Yet 5.Qf3 and 5.Nge2 are both more popular alternatives.} Nxb3 {5...Bb4 seems a reasonable alternative, but as Black set up the exchange, Black might as well go through with it.} 6. axb3 Bb4 {Alternatives are 6...d5 or 6...Bc5.  The purpose is really to facilitate ...d5 shortly.} 7. Nge2 {Played presumably, to retake on c3 with a knight (and by so doing, discouraging Black from exchanging at all).  But I had no special desire to exchange: the pin was serving its purpose.  Better might have been 7.Nf3.} d5 {In my view the position here is even.  Black threatens ...d4, so White isn't left with much option.} 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. O-O O-O {There was little point in ...Nxc3, but now White can exchange on d5.} 10. Bd2 Be7 {No point in exchanging, so the bishop departs the scene.  As ...Bd6 or ...Bc5 were likely to be met by Ne4, the bishop retreats as far as it will go.} 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 12. Nc3 Qc6 {A good sanctuary for the Queen.  It was later to prove a handy jumping off place for a counter-offensive to meet White's K-side attack.  At this point, there is little to choose between the sides.  Black has the bishop pair, and White has doubled pawns.  Yet White's game is solid, and has no real weaknesses except maybe at c2, and that is well masked.  But, having seen that Black's K-side is lacking defenders, White judges the time propitious to begin K-side operations.  } 13. Qh5 {In the game Laszlo Kiss vs Heinrich Rolletschek, White played 13.Qe2, and went on to lose in the end game.  Here White chooses a more aggressive line.  Who's to say he was wrong?} f6 {Partly to protect the attacked e-pawn (as Rolletschek did in his game) but also to strengthen the centre AND the dark squares on the K-side.  Lacking a light-square bishop, White won't find it easy to exploit the weakened light squares.  Having said that, the g7 and h7 squares have been weakened slightly - something for White to aim at, and something of which Black has to be aware - and beware!} 14. f4 {Very good: a direct strike at  Black's centre.  } Bd6 {Exchanging on f4 looked most unappealing - giving up much of Black's central presence.  Hence the choice to defend.} 15. Rae1 {Adding pressure against Black's centre, but really to reinforce the developing K-side operation.  White's game is looking fairly promising, but, even though the Black Queen's bishop has yet to move, Black is solidly placed.  Game on. } b6 {Although the light square bishop covers h3 - a square that White might find useful - there are few prospects for it in the c8-h3 diagonal otherwise.  So the bishop looks to greener fields.} 16. f5 {[!?] Not really surprising, though I was more expecting the exchange on e5.  But the exchange didn't offer White much, not to mention that opening up the centre would have compromised White's planned flank attack.  The centre isn't fully closed, but is sufficiently rigid to encourage White to continue with his plan.} Bb7 {Threatens an immediate checkmate!  Black's bishop pair is looking very powerful, though not enough to present yet a serious challenge to White's position.} 17. Re2 {Covering g2.  White wants to play Rf3, and might have done here, but then he might want to continue with Rh3.  Hence the choice, for the time being, of using one rook for defence and the other for attack.} Bc5+ 18. Kh1 {Only move.  Were Black's queen not on the long diagonal, those Black bishops would be a considerable constraint upon White's K-side ambitions.  But the queen is handily placed on c6, as will be seen.} Bd4 {A very nice spot for the bishop.  Pinned against c2, the knight can not move to make way for the c-pawn to drive the bishop away.} 19. Qg4 {Switching his aim from h7 to g7 as the more vulnerable target.  Among other things, this makes Bh6 a threat.} Rf7 {This could probably have waited a move, but it would simply have meant a reversal of move order, as the alternative would have been 19...a5.} 20. Rf3 {heading for the g- or h-file as seems most convenient.  White's attack is developing slowly, but is progressing.  The defensive counter-measures Black has undertaken seem to be now pretty much in place, not to be improved upon.  Can Black undertake something positive?} a5 {[!] Yes, he can!  This is the small beginning of Black's counter-action.  Whilst White attempts to batter down White's K-side defences, Black throws everything into counter-attack, leaving the King, rook and his pawn wall to hold on.} 21. Rg3 {Now g2 is very well protected indeed, whilst Bh6 is a threat.} a4 {[!] Already threatening to open up the a-file. } 22. bxa4 {Best.  22.Nxa4 was unplayable on account of 22...Qxc2; and 22.b4 would have been met by 22...a3.  } Bxc3 {[!]  This turned out to be a bit of a find.  The exchange might look counter-intuitive: giving up a powerful bishop for a knight that isn't doing all that much and is pinned, into the bargain.  But the idea is to weaken White along the back two ranks.  It was the discovery that 23.Bxc3 was unplayable that determined this decision.  Can you see why?  } 23. bxc3 {[!] Absolutely essential.  So why could White not have played 23.Bxc3?  This is the 'hidden' queen 'sacrifice': 23.Bxc3 Rxa5 24.Qh5 Qxc3!! 25.bxc3 Ra1ch and mates.  After 23...Rxa5, whatever White plays, he loses a bishop at least, and the game with it.  } Rxa4 24. c4 {White wanted to keep the Queen on the g-file, so he blocks the rook's threat.  A good alternative might have been 24.d4!?} Ra2 {It was very tempting to play 24...Ra1ch, here, but a follow-up seemed to be lacking.  24...b5 was another idea, though I don't recall considering it.  The second rank was my target.} 25. Be1 {Uncovering a defence for the rear c-pawn.  After 25.Bc1 Ra1 26.Re1 Qa4 27.Qe2 or Qd1, and White is thrown upon the defensive.  Attack is what he's after.} Qa4 26. h4 {White is prepared to abandon his Q-side in the interests of attack.  Here comes his infantry assault column.} Rxc2 27. h5 {27.Rxc2 Qxc2 and it is hard to see how White can reinforce his attack.  White plans to lever open at least one of the g- or h-files.} h6 {Circumspect; holding off the pawn, and apparently localising the attack to the g-file only.  But White still has his dark-square bishop!} 28. Kh2 {Obviating nuisance checks or pins along the back rank.} Rc1 29. Bd2 {Black seems to have walked into this:  the bishop vacates the back rank with a gain of tempo.  Appearances are deceiving:  Black has his own plan to pursue!} Rd1 {I very nearly played 29...Rf1, here, and that might even have been the better option.  I don't think there is all that much in it, though.  The Queen has a1 available.} 30. Bxh6 {At last, White seems to be threatening a breakthrough.  The threat, Bxg7, is impossible to meet with the K-side defensive resources available.  Black has to hurry forward his own attack.} Qa1 {Threatens an immediate checkmate.  How often so far has White been forced to interrupt his programme to stave off imminent threats?} 31. Rh3 {There was no real choice.  For the moment, White K-side assault has stalled.  But Black now has no checkmate.  } Rf1 {The intent behind this was that after the likely 32.Be3 Qd1 33.h6 ... Black would win with 33...Re1!  It didn't quite work out that way!} 32. Be3 Qd1 {Per spec.  At this point, though still half expecting 33.h6, I began looking around at alternatives.  At first moves like 33.Rh4 or 33.Kg3 seemed to rule ...Re1 out of court.  What to play instead?  Then I lit upon the remarkable 33...Bf3!! in reply to both.  Pleased with this, I awaited White's 33rd move...} 33. h6 {The move I half-expected, and it is probably better than anything else White could have played.  After, say, 33.Kg3 Bf3!! completely disrupts White's position: The queen is threatened, and so is the e2 rook.  White best seems then to give up the queen: 34.Qxf3 Rxf3ch 35.Kxf3 Qxd3 and Black should win comfortably.  The same recipe can be applied to 33.Rh4 Bf3!  It is moves like this bishop move that reaches the heights of beauty in chess.} Bf3 {[?!]  Completely forgetting that I had already planned the decisive 33...Re1!  Now comes a tactical flurry as White still tries to finish off the Black king.} 34. h7+ Kh8 {Forced.} 35. Ra2 {[!] I had completely overlooked this move!  Note that White is offering his queen, but Black dare not accept: 35...Bxg4?? 36.Ra8ch Rf8 37.Rxf8#!  So the bishop simply had to stay on the long diagonal.   But against that, White is also threatening 36.Qxf3!! } Qb1 {Maybe 35...Bc6 ought to have been examined more closely... But at least 36.Qxf3! is answered decisively by 36....Rh1ch 37.Kg3 Rxh3ch 38. Kxh3 Qxa2!, and the a8-square is adequately covered.} 36. Ra7 {The threat is once again Qxf3 followed by Ra8ch.} Bc6 {[!] That brings to a halt White's counter-counter-attack.  He makes one more direct try...} 37. Qg6 {There is no good defence against 38.Qxf7 ... 39.Qf8#.  But does Black need a defence?} Qe1 {No.  Black threatens mate in one; White has no effective defence against this last assault by Black; and White's own attack is simply not quick enough.} 38. Bf2 {Hoping, no doubt, for 38...Rxf2??} Qxf2 {The win of the bishop is nothing:  Black threatens 39...Qg1ch 40.Kg3 Qxg2ch 41.Kh4 Rf4ch etc. White can slow it down, but not stop it.  White timed out at this point, but he could equally well have resigned.  But what a game!}
