1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This is the first time I have annotated a game since suffering the Big Slump Part 2 which robbed me of my Class A Status.  Still, I got there once and I could get there again - there are still a couple of games in my active list that I could lose, however, after that, depending on my other positions it will be start from scratch.  Anyhow, at least this won game game and another win against a 1400+ player gave me some respite from the slump.  Anyhow, here is a game where I quickly got into difficulties but my opponent adopted the wrong plan to take full advantage.  He failed and eventually took a pawn which led to him losing his king.  We start with a double king pawn opening and then my opponent plays the Philidor with 2. d6.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - the Exchange Variation of the Philidor.} c5 {4. ...... c5 - an unusual move but it does have a healthy percentage in black's favour in the database.} 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Nc3 {6. Nc3 - development.} a6 {6. ..... a6 - preventing Nb5 and possibly preparing b5.  I did contemplate Nd5 but then decided to develop Fou Leblanc.} 7. Bc4 Nc6 8. Be2 {8. Be2 - this retreat breaks a pin.} Nf6 9. Bg5 Be7 {9. ...... Be7 - black returns the compliment.} 10. Nd2 Bxe2 11. Qxe2 {11. Qxe2 - bishop trade.} Nd4 {11. ...... Nd4! - strong move, attacks Glenda and hits at c2 preparing a very nasty fork on Henry and my Queen Rook.  Glenda must retreat to d1 to do some more serious defending!} 12. Qd1 h6 13. Be3 Qb6 {13. ..... Qb6 - now the b7 pawn comes under the hammer from the Wicked Witch of the West.} 14. Rb1 O-O-O 15. f3 {15. f3 - I decided to bolster my e4 pawn.} g5 16. Bxd4 cxd4 {16. ..... cxd4 - a B for N trade.  I decided to remove the annoying d4 knight but I think I have opened up a new can of worms.  After Ne2 I cannot now castle because of a nasty discovered check by d3.  Spot the piece that will be giving the check.} 17. Ne2 d5 18. a3 {18. a3 - to prevent Bb4.} dxe4 19. fxe4 Ng4 {19. ..... Ng4! - eek this is getting very nasty, black now has a very strong attack.} 20. Nf1 Nf2 21. Kxf2 {21. Kxf2 - forced as Glenda and my king rook were forked.} d3+ {21. ..... d3+ - here is the discovery that I referred to in a previous note though if black regains the knight then at least Qxe2 does win a pawn.  My position will still be very shaky though.} 22. Ke1 d2+ {22. .... d2+ - but he does not regain his piece.  I now swipe off his pawn with my sleeping knight on f1, walking it into a pin but at least I will be a piece and a pawn up.  Henry is stuck in the centre and my knights are gonna get pinned, so how does Houdini Jo get out of this one.} 23. Nxd2 Qe3 24. b4 {24. b4! - preventing Bc5 and preparing Rb3 ejecting the Witch from my third rank.  I am prepared to give up my a3 pawn to stymie black's attack.} Bf6 25. Rb3 Qb6 26. c4 {26. c4 - preparing c5 to shut off the Witch's power down the g1-a7 diagonal.} Qe6 27. Rf1 {27. Rf1 - if QxP then RxB.  I also bring my rook into play.} Rd7 28. Qc2 {28. Qc2 - She moves! She moves!  After being totally pedestrian since Move 12, Glenda awakens, only for that Sleeping Beauty to be given the task of defending the e4 pawn.} Rhd8 29. Rff3 {29. Rff3 - a rook swinger to prepare to counter black's heavies which control the d column.} g4 30. Rfd3 {30. Rfd3 - mission accomplished.} Bg5 31. Rxd7 Rxd7 {31. ...... Rxd7 - one pair of rooks is traded on the d column.  Tip, when up in material, trade pieces not pawns and preferably heavies.} 32. Rd3 {32. Rd3 - I attempt another such trade off .....} Re7 {32. ..... Re7 - but black eschews it and decides to pile up on my e4 pawn instead.} 33. Rd5 {33. .... Rd5 - I think this could be a useful placement for my rook which could be prepared to swing to the c file.} Bxd2+ 34. Qxd2 {34. Qxd2 - taking back with the queen sets a trap.  Now the e4 pawn is highly toxic.} Qxe4 {34 ....... Qxe4?? - He eats it, he eats it, now here it comes ......} 35. Rd8+ {35. ...... Rd8+ ...... wait for it ......} Kc7 {35. ...... Kc7 (forced) ...... wait for it .....} 36. Qd6# {36. Qd6 MATE!! - Here it is - just look at Glenda now, not so defensive here is she?  Underestimate her at your peril.  Just look at the final position - the d column was controlled by black heavies and Henry and Glenda were under siege on their home squares.  Now the d column is controlled by white heavies.  Note that here Henry is in Old Matey's shadow - although it is black's turn to move he cannot execute the mate because his own king is in check and cannot get out of it so it is black that cops Old Matey.  Whew, what a relief!}
