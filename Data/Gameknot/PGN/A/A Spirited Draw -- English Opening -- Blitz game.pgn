1. c4 g6 2. Nc3 Bg7 3. Nf3 d6 4. g3 c6 {Oh, Black's trying to be clever by masking his plans for the coming defense by playing Hedgehog-type moves while waiting for White to commit to something besides normal development. } 5. Qc2 {The text is a bit of a departure for me. Typically I'd just play d3-Bg2 and castles, letting subsequent events decide where my Queen is best posted.} Nf6 6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O Na6 8. d3 e6 {Black's still determined to hide his cards, though ...d5 seems an imminent reality.} 9. Bd2 d5 10. cxd5 exd5 11. e4 dxe4 {The other option, 11. ...d4?!, strikes me as ultimately antipositional and therefore inferior because after 12. Ne2 Black's DSB will remain blocked for a while, nothing but an onlooker as each sides other pieces seek activity. So in my opinion Black made the right move.} 12. dxe4 Qe7 13. Rfe1 Nb4 14. Qb1 Qc7 {? -- 14. ...Rd8 was much better, exerting pressure on the center and threatening to stick a dagger in the heart of White's game with 15. ...Nd3.} 15. a3 {No second chances!} Na6 16. Qc1 {?! -- Better was 16. b4, gaining space and hemming in the a6 Knight.} Nc5 {With a renewed threat of ...Nd3.} 17. Qc2 Be6 18. Nd4 {Black is aiming at b3 with either N or B.} Nfd7 19. e5 {?! -- Sometimes the obvious move is the right one. The simple 19. Nce2! is correct in all variations because the discovered attack on c5 forces Black to spend a tempo to defend either with ...b6 or ...Na6 the steed's 3rd trip (!) to that square, allowing White to gain both time and a better postion with moves like 20. b4 or 20. Rac1. This "clever" pawn sac nearly costs White the game.} Bxe5 20. Nxe6 Nxe6 21. Bh6 Bg7 22. Bxg7 Kxg7 23. Rad1 Nf6 24. Rd2 {Virtually compels simplification, but being a pawn down exchanges can only help White.} Rad8 25. Red1 Rxd2 26. Rxd2 Rd8 27. Rxd8 Qxd8 28. Qd1 Qb6 {Black knows that if the Queens come off his chances of winning nearly vanish, especially when White has the only Bishop.} 29. Qc2 Nd4 30. Qd3 Nf5 31. Na4 Qa5 32. Nc3 Qc5 33. h3 {...Ng4 was the threat.} Qe5 34. g4 Nh4 35. Qd2 {Defending both the b and f pawns. White is very much on the defensive now.} Nxg2 36. Kxg2 h5 37. g5 {! -- Forces the Black Knight to retreat, giving White some much-needed breathing space.} Nh7 38. f4 {Because Black has no checks, this move is strong.} Qf5 39. Qd4+ Kg8 40. Ne4 {! -- poisoning the f-pawn just about as much as a pawn can be poisoned. If 40. ...Qf4??  41. Nf6+ wins.} Qb5 41. Qd8+ {Now White forces a draw by perpetual.} Nf8 42. Nf6+ Kg7 43. Ne8+ Kg8 44. Nf6+ Kg7 45. Ne8+ Kg8 {And drawn. White dare not play for more because of the weaknesses of his pawns in relation to the exposed position of his King.}
