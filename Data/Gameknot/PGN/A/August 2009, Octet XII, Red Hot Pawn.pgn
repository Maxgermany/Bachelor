[Opening "French (C05), Tarrasch, Botvinnik variation"]

1. e4 e6 {Ah, the French Defence! That most reprehensible of opening systems. If Wilhelm Steinitz, one of the most solid world champions ever, was moved to say "I have never in my life played the French Defence, which is he dullest of openings" then it must indeed be tedious! } 2. d4 d5 {Unfortunately, the simple fact of the matter is that the French is a perfectly sound opening. Black can even have some fun counter attacking if white goes all in for an attack and gets over ambitious. When I first started playing 1.e4 I used to hate playing against the French Defence as I always felt out gunned and unfamiliar with the thematic ideas. } 3. Nd2 {In the end I decided that I would "just have to learn some theory" and I settled on the Tarrasch Variation (3.Nd2) as my weapon of choice. All in all I have to say that it hasn't let me down. In particular the long forcing line that you are about to see has served me very well indeed both over the board and in correspondence games. } Nf6 {This is the Closed System of the Tarrasch which seems to be the most popular at club level. 3.... c5 is the other main line. } 4. e5 Nfd7 {Black lures white's central pawns forward in the hope of undermining them later by playing c5, Nc6 and Qb6 or f6. White must be careful not to over exert himself or neglect his development too much. } 5. c3 c5 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Ne2 {This move may look strange but it is important. White doesn't develop his king's knight to f3 as he may wish to play f4 later on, or have the need to protect his d-pawn again with the other knight going to f3. } cxd4 8. cxd4 f6 {Black is ready to strike back in the centre. Now that the c-pawns have been exchanged off the white d-pawn can start to look very weak in some lines. Unfortunately, by playing 8....f6 right now, black gives white the chance to initiate some tactics that are very double -edged. Many players of the black pieces believe they will be better off playing 8....Qb6 in order to force 9.Nf3 before committing to 9...f6. } 9. Nf4 {This is the move that initiates all the fun and games as white takes advantage of black's temporary weakness on the h5-e8 diagonal. } Nxd4 10. Qh5+ {Of course this wouldn't have been possible were white's other knight on f3. } Ke7 11. exf6+ Nxf6 12. Ng6+ hxg6 13. Qxh8 Kf7 {The last few moves have all been pretty much forced. Now white must decide how to proceed. He has a rook for knight and pawn, he has displaced the black king and created structural weaknesses in the enemy position. On the negative side, black has mobile central pawns, one of which is passed and he will be able to develop more harmoniously in the short term. This position is wonderfully imbalanced, unclear and dynamic with chances for both sides. Just how I like them! } 14. Qh4 {Opting to continue with the direct threats and bringing her majesty back into play. } e5 15. Nf3 {This is a crucial move. Until this move was found this line had been considered to favour black. Now suddenly things are not so clear. White offers black the chance to equalise the structural weaknesses in exchange for speeding up his development and opening lines of attack. So far I have yet to lose a game after this position has been reached, although I've come damn close a couple of times it must be said! } Nxf3+ {Alternative variation: 15... e4 [Is possibl e and leads to play that is at least as unclear as the mainline. For example] 16. Nxd4 Bb4+ 17. Bd2 Bxd2+ 18. Kxd2 Qa5+ 19. Kd1 exd3 20. Nb3 Qc7 21. Rc1 } 16. gxf3 Bf5 {Now it is black's turn to force the play. } 17. Bxf5 gxf5 18. Bg5 {This then is the crucial position from which numerous variations can arise. Every time I've played this line over the board this position has been reached in about 10 minutes or so and at this point my opponent has stopped for a lenghty think. Before we look at the possible continuations it is worth assessing the situation. By exchanging the knights on f3 and the bishops on f5 black has managed to improve his pawn structure and weaken white's. The central pawn phalanx could be very threatening indeed in the end game and so black has every reason to be optimistic. White on the other hand must base his play around getting control of the c and or g files and infiltrating his queen into black's position. The game is on a knife edge. } Qa5+ {This is considere d to be best. Black kicks the enemy king and prepares to complete his development with Be7 and Rc8. Almost as important however, he denies white's queen the a4 square from where she may be able to infiltate the black camp. For the moment the white queen is fairly immobile. Alternative variation: 18... Bc5 [ looks fairly logical but allows white to play] 19. O-O-O [ when white can get his king to safety on b1 and start marauding with his rooks. ] Alternative variation: 18... Be7 19. O-O Qd6 20. Rac1 d4 21. Rfd1 [was played in one of my over the board games. White is well placed but I managed to go astry from here and was lucky to escape with a draw in the end.] Alternative variation: 18... Rc8 [ has also been tried before and play continued] 19. O-O Rc4 20. Qh3 Qd7 21. Rad1 Qe6 22. Rfe1 } 19. Kf1 Rc8 {This was the first move that was new to me. I had previously seen Alternative variation: 19... g6 [this practically forces the exchange of bishop for knight as otherwise the knight will go to h5 and then possibly to f4 from where it will be very well placed. So now] 20. Bxf6 Qa6+ $1 [an imporotant intermezzo this allowing black to capture on f6 with the queen and thereby retain control of the h8 square.] 21. Kg2 Qxf6 22. Qa4 $1 [and white avoids an endgame that will not be pleasant for him. The game remains in the balance as white will now aim to get his rooks on the open c-file and his queen to d7.] } 20. Kg2 Be7 {Black is preparing the advance of the g-pawn again. White must fight for the open c-file at once. } 21. Rac1 Rc6 {I thought this move looked dangerous. Black avoids surrendering the c-file via and exchange of rooks and gives himself the option to play Qc7 doubling the heavy pieces. Now if white plays 22.Rxc6 bxc6 23.Rc1 then simply 23....c5 closes the file permanently and leaves white struggling. On this basis I decided that the best course would be to maintain the tension and try and get my queen back into the picture. } 22. Qh3 {This move is thematic in this variation. White wants to play f4 at some point in order to give his queen access to the third rank. } g6 23. Bxf6 {This exchange is just as forced now as it was in the variation given a couple of moves ago. The black knight must not be allowed to go to h5. } Bxf6 24. f4 e4 {There was little point in taking the f4 pawn. } 25. Qb3 {The point of white's play. With the e-pawn pinned, white hopes to exert pressure on it with 28.Rhd1.  } Rb6 26. Rc7+ {This was what I'd been hoping for. The tempo gained from this move I was hoping to get a foothold on the c-file and switch my queen back to the h-file to exert pressure down there. } Be7 {This turns out to be a critical error. Black moves his bishop into a pin and removes pressure from white's b2 pawn. The correct way to play was Alternative variation: 26... Ke6 27. Qh3 [of course 27. Qc2 is no good as the bishop also hits b2 so white must take his chances with the h-file] Rxb2 28. Rhc1 Qd2 29. Rf1 Qxf4 30. Qh7 Qf3+ [and now, unless white can conjure something up against the black king he is busted.] } 27. Qh3 {Now the threat of 28.Qh7+ is very grave. } Qb4 {He has to defend the bishop, giving white the chance to double on the c-file. Alternative variation: [Not much of an alternative was] 27... Re6 28. Qh7+ Kf6 29. Rc8 Rc6 30. Rg8 Ke6 31. Qxg6+ Kd7 32. Qe8+ Kd6 33. Rg6+ Kc7 34. Qxe7+ Kb6 35. Rg7 Kb5 36. Rd1 [ and white is clearly winning.] } 28. Rhc1 {In fact this is uneccessary as 28.Qh7+ Kf6 29.h4! was even stronger and more forcing. Unfortunately, I hadn't realised quite how good my position was. } Qd6 {28....e3! with the threat of 29....Qe4+ shows how fragile white's advantage is and would have made the game double edged again. } 29. Qh7+ Kf6 30. Qh8+ {I knew that I had a draw here if I wanted one. I simply hadn't appreciated that 30.Kh3 vacating the g-file for the rook was a winning line. Possibly I was guilty of giving my opponent too much respect based on his higher grading. } Kf7 31. Qh7+ Kf6 32. h4 {Eventually I decided that this was worth a try with the threat of 33.h5. Of course 33.Kh3 was still best. } Qe6 {Black is manouevring to get his queen to g8. } 33. h5 gxh5 34. Qxh5 Qg8+ 35. Kh2 {Finally, I felt like I was going to get over the line. } Ke6 36. Rg1 {With the rook coming to the g-file it is all over bar the shouting. } Qf8 {Now all the lines lead to mate. } 37. Rg6+ Bf6 38. Rxf6+ {This wouldn't have been so easy to find over the board but in a correspondence game where you can try out all the ideas in a position before selecting your move, this return of the exchange was fairly elementary to figure out to check mate. } Kxf6 { Alternative variation: [If] 38... Qxf6 [then] 39. Qe8+ [leads to mate next move on d7 or e7.] } 39. Qg5+ {After this move my opponent resigned because check mate is coming after 39....Ke6 40.Qg6+ Qf6 41. Qe8+ Kd6 42.Qd7++ }
