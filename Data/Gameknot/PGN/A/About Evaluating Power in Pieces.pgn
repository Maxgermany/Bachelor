[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {This technically should be "Blitz Series 5" of my usual set of games involving my blitz games, but frankly, I felt the overall chess concepts explored in this match were much better suited for a general annotation. That said, keep in mind that both players have a 5:00 clock, where 15 seconds are added for each move.} c5 {Anyway, we begin with the Sicilian. I might play 1 ...e5 when I've decided shenanigans from classical King's Pawn games don't bother me anymore. That probably won't be for years, frankly.} 2. Bc4 {This variation of the Sicilian is considered inferior to most lines, most popular being the Open variation (2. Nf3) or the Closed (2. Nc3). The idea is, Black wants to plan a strong d5 push, and without a pawn on c4 for White, that bishop will go under fire the moment he plays this, and White will lose tempo in preparing against it. White still has ample opportunity, but not as much as other lines in my opinion.} e6 {Like I said, Black's idea is wanting a strong grip on a d5 pawn push. Also, the DSB is ready to protect the pawn on c5. This is the main line.} 3. d3 {Rather passive for White. Protecting e4, but Black isn't gearing to seize that square yet. Meanwhile, the LSB is blocked out from the rest of the board entirely. Maybe planning to play Bg5 one day without needing to worry about the center, but this move gives Black a lot of breathing space.} Nc6 {Gripping the d4-e5 squares before White can get there. If White wants to push further ahead down the board, he will have to start reacting to my development now.} 4. c3 {This keeps the knight out of the 4th rank. Perhaps White doesn't like getting harassed by minor pieces so early on in the game.} Nf6 {Putting more support on d5 while preparing for Bg5 from White.} 5. Nf3 {But instead, White enables castling and continues trying to build his defenses.} d5 {So I begin the first attack.} 6. exd5 exd5 {White has little reason to decline the exchange. Black has little reason to play Knight takes.} 7. Bb5 {White did have a few other options here, however. Qe2+ probably would be a bad idea as Be7 would just accelerate Black's castling. Then Bb3 was there, which could have been a good alternative in order to bring the bishop to c2, pairing the bishops as you would in the Ruy Lopez. But frankly, White's LSB is rather cramped by the d3 pawn, and isn't very good in this game than if it could retreat to e2. Is it worth it for White to consider preserving his bishop here?} Be7 {I'm not worried if White captures, and if he doesn't, the knight will free itself very soon.} 8. O-O {Instead, he moves to hide the kings.} O-O {I oblige. Again, I don't care enough about the knight to play ...Bd7, undermining the d5 pawn once the Queen no longer protects it.} 9. Bxc6 bxc6 {Instead, I'm happier to give d5 an extra defender, and putting Bb7 on the cards.} 10. Nbd2 {White continues to develop, clearly behind Black's part.} d4 {I thought Black might be overreaching a little with this move, but on the other hand, I believed White gets hurt with the pawn stuck on d3. It blocks the White Queen from the center, and should White exchange pawns, then my pawns no longer double and d3 is forever stranded.} 11. Qa4 {The Queen couldn't attack d4 from d1 very effectively, but I neglected this fork. With c6 left hanging and d4 attacked a third time, I needed to figure out how to cut my losses.} Bb7 {I decide to defend the weakest pawn. I'm not as sure anymore what would have happened if I went with ...dxc3, but I guess I wanted to leave White's d pawn stranded without having to worry about White's Queen being relatively safe in the Black camp. It doesn't look like White has any winning moves down that way, but why get so nervous with a Queen being so close in the first place?} 12. cxd4 {So, I lose the exchange. I'm down that pawn, so there's no sense trading further.} a6 {Looking at this further, I guess I'd mark this move with a (?). This would have been more effective if I still had a b-pawn, but I guess this pawn is better off with the bishop guarding it as well?} 13. Qb3 {I was more concerned about White having a plan to bring the knight in to c4 to harass my pieces on b6, but I guess he had other ideas.} Qc7 {My Queen defends, eyeing h2 and joining the rooks.} 14. dxc5 Bxc5 {White then forces this exchange. At first, I thought it was rather pointless, because the pawn was fairly well posted on c5. } 15. Ne4 {But no, this happens. This is the first exchange I have to seriously consider. White is giving up a knight, opening his bishop, attacking a loose piece, and a piece linked to the king guarded only by Pawn in front of it. It's clearly being given up here, and I'm being forced to choose which piece I'd rather keep.} Nxe4 {And in the end, the board is very open right down the middle. My bishop is on the right diagonal to harass, and if I let the bishop be captured on c5, my ability to defend the Queenside looks scary at best, so I force the pair of knights off. The DSB is clearly better for Black to want to keep.} 16. dxe4 {Meanwhile, this pawn just might end up uniting with the f pawn some day. My pieces might be slightly more active for the time being, but White's gaining more space, and I need to make sure I have enough counterplay to make the material disadvantage worth having on my part.} Ba7 {So, I hide away the bishop pair. White's King is in an unfortunate corner now; it definitely looks like my bishops are going to be stronger than his uncoordinated Bishop/Knight team.} 17. Be3 {White notices this too, and begins trying to force one of the bishops off. Black must figure a way to keep White at bay and develop more grip on the board, or simple exchanges will force me to get defensive after the board clears up some more.} c5 {And to my fortune, the White LSB's sacrifice seems to be in complete vain at this point.} 18. Qc2 {White's really wanting to exchange those pieces now.} Rac8 {And I defend.} 19. g3 {A mistake. White has a certain idea in mind, but I think it misses the mark entirely.} Rfe8 {Black now has total control of e4, and after g3, the light squares around the White King are weak. e5 is no longer an option.} 20. Bf4 {White still tries to help matters by going through with the plan of harrassing the Queen.} Bxe4 {And I could have declined by placing the Queen on c6, but I felt I gained more by hitting the other Queen back with equal material. With tempo- the White bishop must retreat after the Black Queen is captured. Black's bishop is safe on c2.} 21. Bxc7 Bxc2 {And after some time, White accepts the queen trade. Black must accept as well.} 22. Bf4 {Also on the cards was Bd6 and Ba5, but I'm not entirely convinced either are better for White. Bd6 is easily harassed by a rook on d8, and the posting isn't as great for the piece on a5.} h6 {I took about a minute to carefully consider how Black should proceed. Frankly, none of my minor pieces need to move at this time, and with my kingside pawns more free after the Queen no longer pins f7, I felt now was a good time to start gaining more ground on my pawn structure.} 23. Ne5 {I believe White was trying to restrict Black's LSB options, or allow a rook on e1, but...} Bb8 {...now the Knight is a weakness. c5 is no longer attacked, and if the Knight moves, White's King safety becomes compromised after the bishop exchange.} 24. Rfc1 {A fair idea, except I'd prefer both Rac1 and Ree1 more than this. Both Rfc1 and Rae1 make the White rook team a little awkward and cramped. Now comes a tough call for Black. Which bishop must be kept?} Bf5 {And I picked the Light bishop- a key turning point decision this match. It's true that most opposite color Bishops result in easy draw outcomes, but this is where reading the board becomes highly important. If my dark bishop can always trade down with White's, I don't need to worry too much about battling the dark squares as much, except most of White's pieces dominate the dark squares. There is a much higher degree of vulnerability on the light squares- especially those around White's King. With the material more equal, and my pawns typically farther along than White's, I need to consider what the endgame exchanges are going to look like, but if I can control all this light-square exposure using the LSB, it has a higher value to Black than the dark one. } 25. Rce1 {Black's next target is clear, so the Knight is defended.} Bxe5 {At any rate, even had I let the LSB fall on c2, what would have likely happened is another exchange on f4, and I wasn't keen on that. I wanted to keep a Bishop for now, especially one that could irritate White's control of the board. Sure, I could double White's pawns on the f file, but my pawns are also uncoordinated on the Queenside. All and all, it'd be rather equal, so I believed Black's game to be better with the opposite bishops.} 26. Rxe5 {White's rook captures here, offering more exchanges, kicking the bishop, and pressuring c5.} Bh3 {This was always the intended home of the bishop.} 27. Rh5 {White thinks he should chase the bishop off h3...} Bg4 28. Re5 {...and only manages to waste a tempo on it.} g5 {Hitting the DSB and blocking the Rook's path to h5, making my bishop even stronger.} 29. Rxe8+ Rxe8 {White continues to simplify.} 30. Bd6 {He hits the pawn.} Rc8 {I defend it.} 31. Rc1 {White starts taking advantage of the dark diagonal, so...} c4 {Now the bishop is pointless.} 32. b3 {Another mistake. Better first would have been Be5.} c3 {The pawn continues to walk. And at this point, a certain idea is born into my mind...} 33. Kg2 {White's King tries to cut my bishop off, with f3 in mind.} Be2 {I'm too developed- his King still has nowhere good to go, and now I threaten ...g4.} 34. b4 {White tries to cut my path off to the pawn again.} c2 35. Bc5 {And he pushes ahead with the idea, thinking he's done it, except...} Bd1 {In reality, White's now playing an endgame with a Pawn and Bishop against my rook.} 36. f3 {So the King starts trying to get into the game.} Rb8 37. Kf2 Rb5 {This was a little unfortunate, though. The idea was to remove the pawn on b4, and promote after placing the rook on b1, but simply pushing ...a5 instead of this would have forced it.} 38. a4 {So White plays this, forever pushing my rook out of the Queenside. } Rb7 39. a5 {Now the a6 pawn is pretty much out of the game, but White can't ever advance ground on b5 without more help, and without the White King, it's just not going to happen.} f5 {Now I decide I need to get my King into the game.} 40. Ke3 Rd7 {-just in enough time to stop the White King from going where he's needed.} 41. Bd4 {That extra flight square is given, but it's too late to stop my King from arriving to the center.} Kf7 42. h3 {I think this was the final nail in the coffin. Kd3 looks much better to me for drawing chances, and I was surprised not seeing it.} Ke6 {White can no longer stop my King from advancing.} 43. Bc3 {Perhaps worried about me winning the bishop on d4, but it wasn't really all that likely to happen.} Rd5 {Reinforcing my position, and refusing to allow the White King any more ground.} 44. Kf2 {He retreats, and sends a Draw offer... thinking I can't advance any further?} Kd7 45. Ke3 {And now he sees the problem.} Kc6 {It's curtains for White after ...Kc4.} 46. Ra1 {So the Rook comes out to stop me from going around the pawns.} Kb5 47. Ra3 {Now he notices c4 is a square, and overlooks one GIANT blunder.} c1=Q+ {And White resigns here. Funny enough, we both had strong clocks at the end of this match! I had over 9 minutes, and he had a bit over 7. Still, it was a great match, and the decision that carried Black's win through to the end was definitely in going to the opposite bishop game! Lesson learned- material is not the only advantage worth considering in exchanges! Thanks for reading! }
