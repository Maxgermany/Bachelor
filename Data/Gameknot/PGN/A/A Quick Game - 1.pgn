1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Bc5 4. Bc4 d6 5. Bd5 {All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible.} Bg4 {I continue normally.} 6. O-O {A mistake. My knight can now position itself on d4, attacking the pinned piece where I can then destroy his kingside pawn structure. If I were white, I might have kicked out the bishop with h3 and g4, then attempt a long castle.} Nd4 {This seems to be a common attack (pinned king knight being attacked by a knight on d4, not this exact variation). I've been crushed by it a few times.} 7. Bxb7 {Thinking he can safely take the pawn, it's hard to come up with anything better though. Surely 7. Kh1 Nxf3 8. gxf3 Bh3 9. Rg1 ... would have been better.} Nxf3+ 8. Kh1 {8. Kh1? That was unexpected.} Nxh2 {The crushing move.} 9. Bc6+ {Didn't even consider an attempted counter, but it is easily handled.} Kf8 {9. ... Ke7 10. Nd5+ Ke6 would be slightly dangerous.} 10. Ne2 {Another mistake.} Qh4 {The rook must not be taken yet, let's not get hasty.} 11. Kg1 {The final mistake allowing mate. The best option was 11. Ng1 Nxf1+ 12. Nh3 Bxd1 which is also devastating.} Nf3+ 12. gxf3 {Forced.} Bxf3 {White resigns with mate in one. He could try 13. Ng3, but then Qxg3#. Anything else allows Qh1#}
