[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Andreaschek gambit"]

1. e4 {Here's the description from my mini-tournament, which starts with the moves 1. e4 c5 2. d4!?  Ken Smith played this opening a lot... 1. e4 c5 2. d4!?, which has a lot of interesting variations that aren't normally seen here on gameknot or anywhere, for that matter. One time Bent Larsen was annotating a game where Smith's opponent played the French Defense, and the annotations went: 1. e4 e6? (Better is 1... c5!, which wins a pawn)} c5 2. d4 cxd4 {The first move actually made in the game -- an obvious and natural one, too.  This is a regular sicilian thus far, with just a different move order.} 3. Nf3 {White has the option of recapturing right away (3. Qxd4), developing with 3. Nf3 and daring white to try to hold onto the pawn with 3. ...e5 (as in this game), or going into the Smith-Morra gambit proper (3. c3), which looks a lot like the danish gambit (for those familiar with 1. e4 e5 2. d4!? exd4 3. c3).} Nc6 {Black decides against e5, and gives me the option to turn this into a standard sicilian game with 4. Nxd4.} 4. c3 {...but how boring would that be?  4. c3!? isn't the soundest gambit, to be sure, since it appears white is offering a pawn for just one tempo, but if I can develop quickly and efficiently, maybe I can turn this into an effective attack.  (That's the goal, anyway!)} dxc3 {I approve of this move, since allowing 5. cxd4 allows white to hit back in the center and regain his pawn -- this is black's best shot for an edge.} 5. Bc4 {!?  Very speculative -- offering a second pawn for one more tempo.  If black bites and plays cxb2, the white bishops will be extremely powerful, but will they be worth two pawns?} e6 {Black isn't biting, and in fact looks to be trying to reduce the influence of white's Bc4 with this move, which gives him a paulsen-like setup.} 6. O-O {Castling seems like a normal developing move here.  Now, I'm still willing to allow cxb2, because my bishop will become very powerful on that long diagonal, especially if black plays Bc5 or the like, which e6 seemed to prepare.} a6 {I didn't understand this move initially, until I realized that black was preparing to play b5, driving my bishop off of c4.  Well, if he's going to be pushing pawns...} 7. Nxc3 {Then I'm going to keep developing pieces!  My goal is to use my edge in development and slight space advantage to launch an attack down the open c- and half-open d-files.} Bc5 {Of course, this is going to require a balance of defending as well, as black is not without his own resources.} 8. a3 {Black may not like the looks of my bishop on c4, and I don't like the looks of his on c5.  This move prepares to knock the Bc5 into the corner.} d6 {?!  Now, this move is perfectly fine, and even makes it into the gameknot game DB (with a win for white), but it is not a good move here.  Why?  First, it prevents the bishop from retreating to e7.  Second, the new moves it allows, Bd7 and Qd7, are not moves black is going to make!  Nge7 was my preferred move here, as if I were black, I'd want to neutralize white's developmental edge as soon as possible!} 9. b4 {Forcing the bishop to a7, as Bb6 would block the b-pawn, hampering the light-squared bishop, and allow further harassment by either a5-a6 or Na5, or even a future Nd5.} Ba7 {The best move, given the circumstances.} 10. Bg5 {Bf4 is probably going to be preferred by many of you reading this, but what I was thinking is that it was going to be most beneficial to provoke weaknesses in black's kingside, since that's clearly where he's going to castle.  } Nge7 {This is probably the best and safest move, as Nf6 would leave black exposed to a dangerous future e5 thrust, and f6 weakens the light squares around black's king.} 11. Rc1 {Putting a rook on this open file can't be a bad idea, can it?  As it turns out, this move never does much, but I was happy to develop this piece to a good square for now.} O-O {Totally consistent.  Black is nearly caught up in development, and I can see that after b5 and Bb7, he'll have his development nearly completed, and all I'll have to show for my pawn is a space advantage.  At this point, I realized I was going to have to turn up the pressure if I wanted to get a (hopefully winning) attack going!} 12. Qe2 {Preparing to give the black queen some uncomfortable opposition with Rfd1!} b5 {Of course this was coming...} 13. Bb3 {And of course I'm going to keep the 2nd rank free for the heavy pieces to maneuver.} Bb7 {...and now black, although cramped, has a good, solid game, and it looks like I don't have enough for the pawn.} 14. Rfd1 {Nonetheless, let's go ahead and continue with loading up on the open and half-open files, and see if an attack develops!} Qb8 {Quite reasonably, black's queen isn't going to stick around and find out what happens if the d-file gets opened!} 15. Rd3 {And this is where I come up with a plan on how to break through -- build an Alekhine's gun on the d-file!  Get an Rd3, Rd2, and Qd1, and just ram it down black's throat!  Is this a good, sound plan?  I'm not sure, even now.  But I'm better developed and more maneuverable, and it's better to have a speculative plan than no plan at all!} Kh8 {Black's clearly thinking about f6, which is impossible at the moment, due to Bxe6 .} 16. Rcd1 {In hindsight, the Rc1 move earlier did keep the black queen off of c7, so maybe it did serve a purpose.  Still, had I known, I could've achieved this configuration a move earlier.  It's silly to harp on it now, but the reason I'm critical of it is that when you're ahead in development, you want to make every move count!  If black catches up in development, then I've got nothing to show for the pawn.  At least I have more space.} Rd8 {...I see he's not going to give me the pawn back so freely and easily.} 17. Rd1d2 {Of course, now he sees I'm planning Qd1, and does he have a good way to defend the pawn a third time?} Ng6 {I guess not.  So, when I first saw this move, I said "ooh, free rook!"  And then I said, no, no, look, if you play 18. Bxd8, he plays Nf4, and then what?  Well, it looks like the complications favor white after 18. Bxd8 Nf4 19. Qd1 Nxd3 20. Rxd3, but I thought I could get a better position by reducing the effectiveness of a possible Nf4.} 18. Qd1 {And in hindsight, maybe Bxd8 was indeed better.  But this isn't terrible, either.} f6 {Of course, black's not going to let me get a free rook out of it!} 19. Be3 {This is the best square I could find, although Bh5 may not have been awful either.  Still, exchanging the dark-squared bishops aren't so important when I'm going to be able to get away with Rxd6 shortly.} Bxe3 {Of course.} 20. fxe3 {A tough move to find, but much better than Rxe3, which disrupts the gun and doesn't prevent Nf4 like the text does.  I'm not worried about the isolated, doubled pawns, because I'm counting on having a successful attack!  So now the lines are drawn; I'm going to try to blow open the center and win material, while black's going to defend and try to make it to a won endgame.} Nge5 {There's a lot to consider here, but this move forces the action.  If I can't do something positive, I'm just going to wind up in an endgame down a pawn.} 21. Rd3xd6 {So let's go for it!} Ng4 {An interesting try!  This threatens Nxe3, but also threatens the cheap Qxh2 if the Rd6 and Nf3 both move!} 22. Rd6xd8+ {Forcing black to recapture with the knight, giving me uncontested ownership of the d-file.} Nxd8 {Of course Qxd8 loses the queen for insufficient compensation.} 23. Rd3 {The best way to defend e3 and still maintain all of my influence down the d-file.} Qc7 {Increasing the queen's scope and freeing the rook, this maintains the threat on h2 if the knight on f3 moves.} 24. h3 {...and I finally can't stand it any more, and I expel the knight.} Nh6 {Black doesn't want me to make his pawn structure suffer the same fate as mine after 24. ...Ne5 25. Nxe5 fxe5, so he retreats to h6.  Note that in some variations, black can avoid a back-rank mate with Ng8 now.} 25. Rd7 {Forcing the queen to move.} Qb6 {This square keeps her as active as possible, and threatens Qxe3 } 26. Qd3 {Parries the threat while keeping the battery on the d-file.} Bc6 {This excellent move forces white to commit to sacrificing the rook for knight and pawn at most.  So, I decide to choose the path which gives me the most activity for it!} 27. Rd6 {Basically forcing Nhf7 (as any other move leaves me ok), which puts me down an exchange.} Nhf7 {...and of course he finds the proper defense.} 28. Bxe6 {This grabs me another pawn, and after Nxd6 Qxd6, I'll have a knight and pawn for my rook, plus a very threatening position.} Nxd6 {...as expected...} 29. Qxd6 {And this is as planned.  Now, I was hoping for Qxe3  here, which looks good for black, but after, say, 30. Kh1 Qxc3, 31. Qf8 is checkmate!  So, there's a lot going on in this position, despite the exchange of some pieces.} Nxe6 {Black chooses the safest route, which is to simplify by exchanging pieces towards a won endgame.} 30. Nd5 {This is a nice in-between move, as it forces the queen to move before I play Qxe6.} Qb7 {Keeping the queen as active as possible.} 31. Qxe6 {I don't know whether to hope for Bxd5 or not!  While exchanges will help black in an endgame, I'm not sure he wants to grant me a passed pawn on d5, especially with his king all the way in the corner.} Qd7 {Instead, he looks for an exchange on more favorable ground.} 32. Nd4 {The sad reality here -- there's nothing I can do to force the queens to stay on the board.  Absolutely nothing.  The best I can do is put my pieces in a more aggressive position if he does exchange.} Rc8 {?  Black doesn't want the exchange?  I realize there are a lot of complications here, but after Qxe6 33. Nxe6, I don't really have a great feeling about my endgame chances with two knights vs. rook and bishop.  The c-file is a nice place for the rook to roost, but I see now that a knight on e7 would be pretty for me!} 33. Qe7 {Will he let me put one there?} Qe8 {Smart man... to say no to that.  But now my position has become very threatening, and my knights are getting closer and closer to his boxed in king!} 34. Nf5 {Now Qxe7 is met by Nfxe7, clearly worse for black.} Qd7 {Black is just repeating moves, and with good reason (Qxg7 was threatening mate)!  I'm going to try and go in for the kill!} 35. Nd6 {Threatening the rook and Nf7 , among other things.  Additionally, if black plays Qxe7, Nxe7 is still very strong for white (maybe even stronger than before!)} Qxe7 {???  Whoa, after all of black's great defense, this move is suicide.} 36. Nxe7 {Very smart.  Forks the knight and bishop, but also threatens Nf7 checkmate!  Black must play Rf8 to save the rook and avoid checkmate, hanging the bishop.  Even so, the ensuing endgame of rook vs. two knights and an extra pawn doesn't leave black with much hope.} Rc7 {?  But this allows a very pretty and very unusual mate...} 37. Nf7# {1-0.  Thanks to bleddy71 for one of the most fun games I've played in a long time.  I realize the game wasn't played perfectly by either of us, but it was a lot of fun and it had an amazing ending for me!}
