1. e4 d6 2. d4 {Quickly forming an "ideal center".} Nf6 {Without time to think, this must have been the defense he had planned to use before the game began.} 3. Nc3 g6 {Planning the fianchetto...} 4. Bg5 Bg7 {...and completing it.} 5. Qd2 {Doubling on the diagonal and clearing the way for castling.} c6 {I'm unclear as to why Black didn't just castle. He never does move his King into safety!} 6. O-O-O {White does take the opportunity to castle.} Qa5 {Black is being "aggressive" when he should instead be concentrating on castling and developing.} 7. Nf3 {White, by contrast, is steadily building an attacking force.} b5 {Seemingly wasting another tempo. The Q-side pieces are still completely undeveloped!} 8. e5 {White, ahead in development, tries to open up the position.} b4 {A bad mistake. Black should not be engaged in a tactical war in his undeveloped state. N/3-Q2 or N-R4 were much better choices.} 9. exf6 {Now Black is down a piece and his KB is en prise.} bxc3 {Recapturing, but it won't help.} 10. Qxc3 {White is up a Pawn and Black has no good options. With his Q and KB both en prise, he's in a world of hurt.} Qxc3 {An attempt to swindle his way out of trouble. If White falls for 11 PxQ?, 11...B-B1! saves the piece. 12 PxP BxP 13 BxB KxB 14 R-K1 ch would still leave White with a strong game, but Black would be able to drag out his resistance for a while.} 11. fxg7 {White wins a piece. If Black moves his Q on B6 out of danger, White will play 12 PxR (Q) ch with a winning material advantage. Black resigns.}
