1. e4 {Team Match, I am playing white and go with the Open Game.} e6 2. d4 {The French Defense, to which white plays the standard response.} d5 3. Nc3 {Main Line. Apparently, this is played in over 40% of all games involving the French Defense.} Bb4 4. e5 {3. ... Bb4 is the Winawer Variation, 4. e5 is the main line response, saving the threatened pawn on e5.} Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 {Main line says to play 4. ... c5 before 5. ... Bxc3+.} Ne7 6. Qg4 c5 7. Qxg7 {The move order was rearranged a bit, but black eventually found his way back to the normal first 6 moves of the Winawer Variation with 6. ... c5?, but with one critical difference. By jumping the gun on 4. ... Bxc3 without waiting for white's standard 4. a3, white has had a chance to play 6. Qg4 one move earlier than the main line (where this move is normally white's 7th move). Result: black's pawn on g7 is undefended and thanks to white's gain in tempo, black doesn't have time for 7. ... 0-0 to defend it.} Rg8 8. Qxh7 {Two free pawns. } Nbc6 9. Nf3 {Not 9. dxc5? leaving white with isolated and doubled pawns on the c-file.} Bd7 10. Bh6 {I had a sneaky plan (well, not very sneaky, really) to play 11. Ng5 threatening the black pawn on f7. I couldn't reverse the move order and play 10. Ng5 and 11. Ba6 because the knight on g5 would block the bishop from reaching a6. However, black's next move invalidates white's 10th move entirely and forces a waste of tempo.} Qa5 11. Bd2 {Back we go, sneaky plan unfulfilled.} O-O-O 12. Qd3 {I struggled with the idea of 12. Qxf7. It's not defended, and a material advantage of three pawns with two passed pawns is much more appealing than an advantage of two pawns with only one passed pawn. But I feared the white queen would be too exposed to attacks by black's rooks, and even if she escaped, black would have even more attacking lanes at white's kingside. So I opted to retreat the queen back for defense. I'm still not sure if this was white's best move here (it felt cowardly when I played it).} c4 13. Qe2 {More retreating, and now white has blocked in his kingside bishop. But 13. Qe3 would block in the queenside bishop instead, and the DSB has more range in this position, so it made more sense to trap the least mobile of the two bishops.} Nf5 14. g3 Rdf8 15. Bg2 {Getting some room for the LSB, and preparing to castle. Black has two half-open files aimed at white's castle, but black's LSB is no help and his queen is far from white's kingside (even Qd8 doesn't help black much since f6, g5, and h4 are well covered by white's pawns and knight). So the castle looks reasonably safe, and it connects whites rooks and allows for white to get a rook on the half-open b-file.} f6 16. O-O {Upon further consideration, 16. exf6 may have been wiser. It allows black to double his rooks, perhaps on the h-file, but with his pawn removed from f7, he could do that anyway. But not capturing on f6 allows black to play fxe5 forcing white to recapture (before or after exchanging knights) with dxe5, isolating the doubled white pawns on the c-file). So, positionally, I think 16. exf6 might have been a better move.} Qd8 17. Rab1 {Well, that was nice of black, taking the pressure off the whtie queenside pawns and allowing white to play Rab1 instead of Rfb1, saving the kingside rook for better things, like support on the e-file if needed.} fxe5 18. Nxe5 Qf6 19. Rxb7 {18. ... Qf6? is a bit of a blunder for black (do you see it without reading ahead?), allowing white to gain material and a strong queenside attack against the black king. I believe his intent was for his queen to support, 19. ... Nxe5 which will do a lot of damage to white's pawn structure. As for 19. Rxb7?!, I don't know how to score this move, so I think I'll give it the old "strange move" notation. White could have played 19. Nxd7 forking black's queen and rook and forcing black to recapture with 19. ... Kxd7 after which 20. Rxb7+ wins a pawn and gets white a rook on the 7th rank. Then I realized I could reverse the order and win a rook, bishop, and pawn for a rook and knight. As played, it exchanges more material, which is good when white is ahead by two, soon to be three, pawns. But it loses the advantage of a rook on the 7th rank. Still, it felt more fun, more "shock and awe", which I needed after my earlier cowardly queen retreat.} Nxe5 20. dxe5 {Black scared me with 19. Nxe5 which, frankly, I had not considered. At first I thought I had blown it since without the knight, there is no Nxe7 to fork the queen and rook, and I will lose my rook for just a pawn, or retreat the rook and lose the knight for nothing. Then I realized that 20. dxe5 threatens black's queen and gives white's rook a chance to escape.} Qg6 21. Rxa7 {So, up four pawns instead of three. All white needs to do now is weather the upcoming black storm on white's castle.} Kd8 22. Rb1 {Thinking about getting one or two rooks on the 8th rank and exchanging with the black rooks.} Ke7 23. Bc1 {Headed for a3 skewing the black king to his rook on f8.} Rfd8 24. Rb6 {I was tempted to play 24. Rb1b7, but the black bishop is fairly safe. White cannot drive black's king farther away than e8 which still defends the black bishop, and allows for black to play Rg7 defending the bishop even more. So 24. Rb1b7 wouldn't get me what I want. What I need is to get the LSB from g2 all the way over to where it can attack the black bishop. If only the black pawn on d5 would go away... Then I realized I could just hunt the d5 pawn instead; make it go away rather than just wish it would.} Nh4 25. Ba3+ {Black does a little hunting of his own. Not 25. gxh4??? allowing 25. ... Qxg2#. However, 25. Ba3+ serves very little purpose and just wastes time, but it doesn't hurt, either, and it adds an extra piece to white's mounting attack against the black king.} Kf7 26. Bxd5 {The black pawn at e6 is pinned: 26. ... exd5? allows 27. Rxg6 and white gains a queen and pawn for a bishop and rook. But if black doesn't capture, the pressure with white's bishop and rook attacking the pawn on e6 is difficult to defend against, and white always has Qxc4 and Bc6. Faced with multiple threats and an overwhelming material deficit, black resigns.}
