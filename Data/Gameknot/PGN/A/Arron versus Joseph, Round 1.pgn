1. e4 {~ A friendly between myself and another fellow community theatre player. Our First Round of three games, which saw me winning two-out-of-three.} g6 {Surprised he would concede the Centre so naively! Fianchetto soon?} 2. f4 {King's Gambit, my all-time favorite.} Bg7 {Cutting across the major diagonal, but the Knights are still back.} 3. Nf3 {King's Knight's Gambit.} Nf6 {Horse will be harassed there.} 4. e5 Nd5 {Black's losing tempo.} 5. d4 {Perhaps my Pawns are too far forward, but I like the domination of space I have here.} O-O {An early decision to Castle, but poorly developed in my honest opinion.} 6. Bc4 {It will be interesting to see how Black deals with pressure on this Knight.} Nb6 {So now both Knights are pushed into the perimeter. I'll maintain my Bishop.} 7. Bb3 d5 {No desire to take the d-Pawn, here. I prefer the flood technique in the Middle.} 8. Nc3 {Finally I get to push out another Horse.} Bg4 {The desire to clear out Pawns Kingside makes me feel comfortable with the Bishop pin. Black is not a threat to me right now.} 9. Be3 {Getting the second Priest out of my way. But I don't have a role for him in this game.} Nc4 {Forked! I knew it was not a sound decision to move the Bishop that far. I will not exchange the Bishop for a Knight.} 10. Bf2 Nc6 {I think I still have the advantage, but what I'm about to do with my light-squared Bishop is maddening!} 11. Ba4 Nxb2 {Forked, Part II! What was I thinking?} 12. Qb1 Nxa4 13. Nxa4 {I am down in material one Pawn. Yet I feel that I will be compensated.} Bxf3 {Doubling my Pawns, Black is so predictable!} 14. gxf3 f6 {This next one could be a poison Pawn if Black plays it right.} 15. Qxb7 Na5 {Perhaps the only choice? But it takes the Knight out of the fight. A Knight on the rim is grim.} 16. Qa6 {e6's Square is tempting me! This could be the break I am looking for.} c5 {Blunder! I can finally cause chaos. 16 ... c6 would not have afforded me this chance.} 17. Qe6+ {Black should retreat the King to h8!} Rf7 {Pin! Now my Knight is back in the battle.} 18. Nxc5 {Will Black offer a exchange of Queens?} Qc8 19. Qxd5 {The d-Pawn suffers for this!} fxe5 {Trying to get compensation for the lost material, but it allows me to break up my Doubled-Pawns along the f-File.} 20. fxe5 Qf8 {Black's Queen is sliding laterally along the Back Rank.} 21. Ne6 {Now Black is finally forked, obvious choice is to spare the Queen.} Qc8 22. Nxg7 {With a pinned-Rook, only the King can capture.} Kxg7 23. Qxa5 {And the forgotten Knight pays the price.} Qxc2 {At this point I stand to lose some Pawns.} 24. O-O {Perhaps I am Castling to early. Or too late.} Rxf3 {I should have managed my Bishops better in this match.} 25. Rac1 Qf5 26. Rc7 {A decision to attack aggressively almost cost me in this game. I have chosen the f7 Square to focus my power, and Black chooses f1.} Rf8 27. Qd5 {Both Kings are unsafe.} Rxf2 {A kind of Alekhine's gun. We'll call it Joseph's gun. He almost makes a thrilling comeback, seizing my Bishop and threatening Mate.} 28. Rxe7+ {My one move left! I hope he blocks with the Rook. If Kh8, then it's over. I would be trapped.} Rf7 {Blunder!} 29. Rxf7+ {An obvious choice for me!} Qxf7 {Of course we'll exchange! I have more Pawns!} 30. Qxf7+ Rxf7 {And my Rooks have X-Ray Eyes! :P} 31. Rxf7+ Kxf7 32. Kf2 Ke6 33. Ke3 {I win the footrace to my back Pawn!} h5 34. h4 {Locking up the Kingside.} a5 35. a4 {Locking up the Queenside, to complete the Zugzwang.} Kd5 {Combinational Chess Theory. I don't see a way for Black to win. I can kill off Pawns on either side of the Board with my King, while promoting to Queen before Joseph.} 36. Kd3 {What a game!}
