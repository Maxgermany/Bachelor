1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {The Classic of Classical openings:  The Giuoco Piano.  It is probably the most 'natural' opening of them all. } Nf6 {The Two Knights' Defence - a most exciting, if risky, response to White's opening.  It practically guarantees a fun game for both sides.} 4. Ng5 {(!?) For a long time this move was the subject of a fierce debate.  GM S. Tarrasch thought it a 'beginner's move', yet the thing packs a powerful punch.  The main alternative was considered to be 4.d4, but in more recent years, 4.d3 has been preferred, transposing into the Bishop's Opening.  I have an uneasy feeling some of the fun might have been taken out of the Two Knights' thereby.} Bc5 {(!?) This crazy-looking response is the signature move of the Traxler (Wilkes-Barre) Variation.  Black flatly ignores the threats against f7.  More usual is 4...d5, but 4...Nxe4 is an old move that might be worth a try sometime.  Of course, the move played was compulsory for this thematic tournament. } 5. Bxf7+ {White has three choices here: to take with the bishop, take with the knight, or temporise and hope for a more favorable moment to take on f7.  Less ambitious than taking with the Knight, the Bishop capture is considered safer, as the White King doesn't come under quite the vicious attack as in the other line.  Rather unambitious is the general verdict upon 5.d4.} Kf8 {For me, an unexpected move - so unexpected, I didn't even notice that he had played it for a couple of moves.  As a result I'm not sure my response was the best.  The fact is, I've never encountered any theory on this move at all.  Yet it does make some kind of sense.  Instead of using the f-file, Black opts to free the Queen's diagonal to h4.} 6. Bb3 {Although it isn't often played against 5...Ke7, 6.Bc4 might be OK in this line.} Qe7 {White was still 'threatening' 7.Nf7, but this Q move seems the logical follow-up to Black's 5th.} 7. d3 {Bolstering the e-pawn against the likely retreat of the g5-knight.  Also opens a line for the c1-bishop.} Nd4 {Black has plans that involve White's bishop at b3...} 8. Nc3 {(?!)  Developing, yet I was almost at once dissatisfied with this move.  I even commented to Freddy that this move seemed misplaced, theough he allowed he might well have played it himself.  Shortly after this I felt that I really needed the c-pawn free to strike at the centre.  Preferable, then, seems the move I seriously considered playing instead: 8.Nd2.} a5 {Part of Black's plan.  Also good was 8...d6.} 9. O-O {Worth a look might have been 9.Bc4, but it isn't the sort of move that leaps to the eye exactly, having moved it 3 times to its present location.  I didn't like advancing the a-pawn, either,  on account of having to recapture 'away from the centre' after 9.a3 Nxb3.} d6 {Freeing up the c8-bishop.  Black is developing a very lively game.} 10. Be3 {(!?) A developing move to strike at Black's imposing centre.  Yet maybe 10.Nd5 ought to have been preferred, to keep up the pressure on f7: 10.Nd5 Nxd5 11.Bxd5 c6 12.c3 cxd5 13.cxd4 Bxd4 14.exd5 and White's game is looking good.  Such a line would seem to vindicate White's 8th move.} Bg4 {(!) Inducing the advanced knight to retreat.  Very annoying, but not unexpected.  Black has about an even game despite the pawn minus.} 11. Nf3 {I could find nothing better than this.  I didn't like the thought of 11...Bxf3 12.gxf3 Qd7 or 11...Nxf3+ 12.gxf3 Bh3, even though such situations sometimes turn out rather well for the open g-file.  I just didn't fancy it at all.  As it turned out, Black had something else altogether in mind.} Qe8 {(!?) Quite unexpected.  What dastardly scheme had Black in mind?  You can rely on it that the was some malice aforethought in this retrograde step.} 12. Bxd4 {Deciding to relieve some of the tension in the centre.  At least now the K-side pawns won't be weakened.  All this rather worried me though.  What made Black decline to capture at f3?} exd4 {All of a sudden I didn't like my game at all.  That bishop at b3 was becoming something of a problem - standing like the condemned, in front of a wall with the firing squad loading their rifles.} 13. Nd5 {The fork threat is incidental.  I'm looking for exchanges.} Nxd5 14. exd5 {Either recapture led to the b3-bishop's entrapment.  However, by taking with the pawn I hoped to buy a tempo with which to effect some kind of counter action.} a4 {Incoming! } 15. Re1 {(!) The beginning of the tactical defence of the bishop.  No use was 15.Bc4 that I could see (15...b5) except maybe as a transposition.} Qd7 16. h3 Bh5 {Would ...Bf5 have been an improvement?  It seems tempting, though, to maintain the pin on the f3-knight...} 17. Bc4 b5 {White is fighting hard.  The point of White's play in the last 3 moves involves the looseness of the protection of the Black's b-pawn after this move.  Somehow Black has to be induced to reliquishing this.  } 18. Ne5 {(!) Desperate, White finds more tactical means to keep the game in flux. } Qf5 {(!?) Instead 18...dxe5 19.Qxh5 bxc4 20.Rxe5 gave White active play for the bishop.  But it seems after all Black can retain an advantage: 20...g6! 21.Qh6+ Qg7 22.Qf4+ Qf7 23.Qh6+ Kg8! 24.dxc4 d3!  White's nominal equality (3 rather weak pawns for the bishop) can not be maintained.  Whether Black looked at this line and preferred the one played, I'm not sure.} 19. g4 {There are a lot of pieces 'en prise'!} dxe5 {(!) Not 19...bxc4? 20.Qc1 and the Black Q is trapped!  20...Qf6 21.Nd7+  or 20...Qc8 21.Qf4+ and wins.} 20. Bxb5 {Now surely the fork at g4 recovers the piece?  What if Black pins the pawn by 20...Qg5, then?  White would play 21.Qf3+! and if 21...Kg8 22.d6! threatening 23.Bc4+; or if 21...Ke7 22.Qg3 attacks the e5-pawn.  Man, I was so hoping Black would play ...Qg5 here!} Rb8 {(!!) Very well played.  White still has a fight on his hands to keep his bishop.} 21. Bc4 {(!) My first thought was the obvious 21.Bxa4, and it's hard to see that there is anything wrong with the capture at all.  However, after 21.Bxa4 it's kiss my hand to any chance of getting a piece back.  For example: 21.Bxa4 Qg5 22.Qf3+ Bf7 and although White would have had 3 pawns for the bishop, I didn't fancy my chances one bit (Understand, I usually prefer the pawns, but not when they are scatttered and weak).} Qg5 22. Qf3+ {(!) Hoping for 22...Bf7 23.d6! or, better yet, 22...Kg8?? 23.d6+ and a quick mate.  Even 22...Ke7 23.Qg3 looked promising.  Will Black oblige?} Qf6 {(!) Black prefers to give back the piece.  The game is about to enter a whole new phase.} 23. Qxf6+ gxf6 24. gxh5 Rxb2 {(!?) Creating new problems elsewhere.  I'm beginning to appreciate that this is the way Freddy plays: continually confronting his opponent with fresh problems to overcome.  } 25. Reb1 {(!) All the same, the exchange of rooks at b1 would suit me more than it would Black.  Of course, the c-pawn is as safe as a babe in its crib: 25...Rxc2?? 26.Rb8+ Kg7 27.h6 and White wins a rook.} a3 {Not a particularly desirable move from Black's point of view, should White get the chance to envelop the rook by Bb3.  He doesn't particularly want to do that now, as Black would certainly exchange at b1, at a moment that is not so favorable to White.} 26. Kh1 {It was this square or h2, but as Black has a dark-square bishop, the corner seemed a healthier spot.  Note, by the way, that though the 'bishop of opposite colour' situation exists, in this game it tends to add to the respective sides' strengths on the light and dark squares, rather than lead to drawish situations.  Meanwhile, Black still mislikes the exchange on b1.} Kg7 {I was expecting the h8-rook to move, here, but Black clearly wanted to get his K to the h-file whilst the 'getting' was good.  } 27. Rbg1+ {All the same, I was happy to occupy the g-file with a gain of tempo, even though Black was now able to bring the material situation to exactly even.} Kh6 28. Bb3 {The irony of it!  This bishop, which a short while ago was fighting for its life in what looked like a fatal trap, slams shut the door to the prison for the rook on b2.  The game now takes on something of the deadlock aspects of the entrenched warfare of the First World War's Western Front.  At the moment, Black has one rook completely immobilsed, and his King shut in on the h-file.  White's pieces are slightly the freer, but he has no counterpart to Black's semi-mobile pawn centre.  Both sides look for an opening, still looking to impose themselves upon the game.} Bd6 {Also coming into consideration were 28...Rb8, with some idea of a jailbreak by ...Rb8xb3; or 28...f5, with a general advance in the centre.  Black chooses something of a temporising move, blockading White's leading d-pawn, and leaving the bishop better placed to support the infantry advance.  White dare not bring the K to h2, which in turn means the h-pawn may not advance.} 29. Rae1 Kxh5 {Again, ...Rb8 and ...f5 were worth considering.  But White can't really stop them anyhow, so Black can afford to tie off a few loose strings before beginning his main attack} 30. Rg2 {Probably the obvious 30.Rg7 was better, but I wasn't yet so prepared to commit myself.  } Rf8 {I was expecting 30...Kh6 here.} 31. Rg7 {Now that the h7-pawn momentarily lacks protection, I bring the rook to the 7th rank.  } Kh6 32. Rd7 {The rook turns out to be quite snug in this sanctuary, but it lacks useful targets.} Rg8 {Black, meanwhile, was happy to take charge of the g-file.  But ingress to White's position isn't so easily won.} 33. Rf7 Kg6 {At this point, I thought the game would be drawn.  The rook would go back to d7, the K to h6 (otherwise White recovers the g-file for good). But Black still had some dry powder left to burn...} 34. Rd7 Kf5 {(!?) Playing to make the best of any winning chances available.  But White is no less ambitious.  } 35. Rxh7 {The passed h-pawn might yet have something to say to the matter.} Kf4 36. Rf7 {Now: the K comes back to save the f-pawn, or the pawn advances to the protection of the King.  36...Rg6 hardly comes into consideration.} f5 37. Re4+ {(!) Chasing off the King.  Unplayable is 38...Kf3?? so the first probing attack is repulsed.} Kg5 38. Re1 {(!) Returning to keep watch and ward over the b2-rook's prison.} Kg6 39. Rd7 Kh6 {Getting off the file before White checks at g1.  The rook at d7 is proving to be a fine guerilla behind enemy lines, striking hard at a vulnerable point, then scuttling back into hiding when rescue arrives.} 40. Rf7 f4 {Plan B.  What will the pawn advance achieve?  From White's point of view, this looked rather harder to deal with.} 41. Kh2 {However, the upside was that this move was safe for the moment.  It would take Black 2 moves to clear the bishop's diagonal to give check, by which time the king would have cleared the obstruction to h3.} Kg6 {To free the f-pawn to advance.  The immediate forward thrust would have been risky: 41....f3 42.h4 e4+ 43.Kh3 and now, if 43...exd3?? 44.Re6+ Kh5 45.Rh7#} 42. Rd7 Kf6 {Avoiding the draw, and the check and keeping the White rook off f7.} 43. h4 f3 44. Kh3 {Just in time to avoid ...e4 check.  But Black's rook can at last penetrate to the second rank.} Rg2 {Black would very much like to have played the e-pawn forward, even without a check.  But for the moment it was completely unplayable owing to 44...e4?? 45.Rxe4 Kf5 (45...Rg2 46.Re6 would have mated in 2) 46.Rf7+ (or 46.Re6) ...Kg6 47.Rxf3 with a powerful attack.} 45. h5 {Pinning my hopes on this advance.  There were quite reasonable prospects this pawn might go all the way, the saucy fellow...} e4 {(!) But reality crashed the party.  No win.  Seeing my way clear to a forced draw, I decided to take no more risks.  } 46. Rxe4 Rb1 {Free at last!  And about to visit retribution upon its jailers!! Black threatens mate on the move.  But White has things under control.} 47. Re6+ Kg5 48. Rg7+ Kxh5 49. Rh7+ {There's no escaping the checks.} Kg5 50. Rg7+ Kh5 {Black declines to mess about with ...Kf4 of ...Kf5 which serve only to prolong the game unecessarily.  Sooner or later the position will recur 3 times.} 51. Rh7+ Kg5 52. Rg7+ Kh5 53. Rh7+ Kg5 {At this point I claimed the draw using GK's threefold repetition protocols.  The claim was upheld.  An interesting game, and my first non-negative result against id=easy19 :)}
