1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This is going back nearly two years when I was a Class C player.  I feel that the Dentist (who has a current Class D rating of 1363) ought to be a Class C player too and this game illustrates the facts.  He gave me nothing in this game and made no obvious mistakes and I ended up having to tread carefully to avoid an ignominious defeat.  In the end I ended up conceding a Low Draw, luckily the game was unrated so I did not incur any penalty points with that result.  Just as well because Gameknot Analysis told me I had a won position, aargh and double aargh.  Here is the link to gameknot analysis:-  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=9023239&fb=1&rnd=0.09381839335531355.  White kicks off with 1. d4.} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 {3. ...... e6 - this opening transposes into a QGD Orthodox Defense (what an appropriate word for a player called jstevens1).  The Dentist becomes very bold and decides to anchor his king knight on e5.} 4. Ne5 c5 {4. ...... c5 - don't wanna get completely bogged down so I hit out at the pawn supporting that potentially annoying steed.} 5. e3 Nc6 6. Bb5 {6. Bb5 - pin.} Qc7 7. f4 {7. f4 - The Dentist just lurves to roll those pawns - just ask the Master Mater!} cxd4 8. exd4 {8. exd4 - pawn trade - I traded pawns to try and break up white's centre.  I must be very patient here.} Bb4 {8. ...... Bb4 - Fou Lenoir now decides to do some pinning.} 9. Be3 Ne4 10. Bd2 {10. Bd2 - white decided to break the pin.  This now triggers off a couple of trades.} Bxc3 11. bxc3 Nxd2 12. Qxd2 {12. Qxd2 - this trade has weakened white's queenside pawn structure but can I take advantage of this?} Bd7 13. a4 Nxe5 14. dxe5 Bxb5 15. axb5 {15. axb5 - this series of trades clears the air.} O-O 16. Rf1 {16. Rf1 - interesting, white decides to keep his king in the centre.} Rfc8 17. Ra3 {17. Ra3 - defending his c3 pawn.} Qb6 18. Qd3 {18. Qd3 - now he defends his b5 pawn. } a6 19. Rb3 axb5 20. Ke2 {20. Ke2 - strange, I expected a move like Rxb5.  Maybe he wants to improve his king's position for the endgame first.} Qc6 21. g4 Qc4 22. h3 Qxd3+ 23. Kxd3 {23. Kxd3 - queen trade.} Rc5 24. f5 Ra4 25. fxe6 fxe6 {25. ..... fxe6 - pawn trade.  White now has pawn islands but alas so do I.  It will be very hard to convert my advantage into a win.} 26. Rb4 Rxb4 27. cxb4 {27. cxb4 - this rook trade re-unites white's queenside pawns.} Rc4 28. c3 Re4 {28. ..... Re4 - trying to corral the isolated e5 pawn.  White threatens to invade with his rook and win my queenside pawns via a1.} 29. Ra1 Rc4 30. Ra5 Rc7 31. Rxb5 Kf7 {31. Rxb5 - my extra pawn drops off and now Henry comes into play.} 32. Rc5 Rxc5 33. bxc5 {33. bxc5 - this rook trade brings me and the Dentist into a K & P ending with even material!} Ke7 34. c4 g5 35. Kd4 dxc4 36. Kxc4 {36. Kxc4 - another set of pawns is swapped off.} Kd7 37. Kb5 Kc7 {37. ..... Kc7 Henry comes to the defense of the b7 pawn.} 38. Kc4 Kc6 39. Kb4 b6 {39. ...... b6 - gameknot analysis (please refer to the link in my intro notes for further detail) told me this was an innacuracy - I should have played Henry to d5 here.  I wanted to make sure that white could not get a passed pawn on the queenside though.} 40. cxb6 Kxb6 {40. .... Kxb6 - now, now, I got a shock when I ran gameknot analysis - for the computer told me that I was winning this game hands down - only I did not see it at the time.  White's king really looks as though he is running the show but looks can be very deceptive.  I, the Class C player I was at the time was certainly deceived, so much so I conceded an unnecessary Low Draw, my only consolation is is that the game was unrated.}
