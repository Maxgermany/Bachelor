1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Dieharder (Chris), a Class D player, wanted somebody to annotate one of his games.  Well, I will do my best to step up to the plate here.  I thought I would choose a hard earned victory over a Class C 1400 player as this can potentially be a lot of meat for the Inquest Jury to feast on.  The game starts with 1. e4, of which black responds c5.  This is the Sicilian Defense, folks!  Also, here is the gameknot analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22951308&rnd=0.8785890754382095} c5 2. Nf3 e6 {2. .... e6 - so far so book!} 3. Bc4 {3. Bc4 - a rarer Sicilian bird here, usually d4 is played and pawns are exchanged on this square.} Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxd5 exd5 {5. ..... exd5 - an interesting piece exchange here.  Black now has doubled pawns.} 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 {7. Nxd4 - now there is that pawn trade.} Nc6 8. f4 Bc5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 {9. ...... bxc6 - a knight trade which keeps black's pawns doubled on the d column and in addition black is left with an isolani on a7.  However, white must be careful as a check on h4 could still potentially cause a few problems.} 10. c3 Qb6 11. Qe2 O-O {11. ..... 0-0 -  potential pressure on f2.  Already white cannot castle kingside due to the g1 square being commanded by the BQ and black's dsb.  Chris frees himself from it on the next turn, however, with 12. b4.} 12. b4 Be7 13. Be3 {13. Be3 - after black retreats his bishop to the only available square, e7, Chris now develops his own bishop and attacks the BQ.} Qa6 14. Qxa6 Bxa6 {14. ..... Bxa6 - queen trade.} 15. Nd2 {15. Nd2 - development.} d6 16. exd6 Bxd6 {16. ...... Bxd6 - pawn trade.} 17. O-O-O {17. 0-0-0 - with queens off the board and approaching an endgame it seems better to either castle long or leave your king in the centre.} f5 18. Bc5 Bxc5 19. bxc5 {19. bxc5 - interesting - after that piece trade it is white who is left with doubled pawns and black can potentially make great use of the b column and e column to cause problems for white.} Rab8 20. Kc2 Rb5 21. Nb3 {21. Nb3 - momentarily closes off the b column and protects the weak foremost doubleton.} Re8 {21. ...... Re8 - Just as I thought.  Black does occupy the b and e column with rooks but Chris does find some counterplay.} 22. Nd4 Rxc5 23. Nxf5 Re2+ 24. Rd2 Rxg2 {24. ..... Rxg2?? - Blunder costing a rook for a pawn - better Rxd2+.} 25. Rxg2 g6 26. Ng3 d4 {26. ...... d4 - trying to use the pin on the c3 pawn to win back a second pawn for the rook.} 27. Ne4 {27. Ne4 - protects pawn and attacks rook.} Ra5 28. cxd4 {28. cxd4 - oh dear, white now returns the compliment.} Rxa2+ 29. Kc3 Rxg2 {29. ..... Rxg2 - nacht.} 30. Ra1 Bb5 31. Rxa7 Rxh2 {31. ...... Rxh2 - pawn trade.} 32. Nf6+ Kf8 33. d5 cxd5 34. Nxd5 {34. Nxd5 - another pawn trade.} Rh3+ 35. Kb4 Bc6 36. Nc7 Re3 37. Kc5 {37. Kc5 - with a rook on the 7th rank and a king on the 8th rank, if a king can oppose it on the 6th rank, then it is curtains for the king on the 8th rank - Old Matey, our chessic grim reaper will have a field day!} Rc3+ {37. .... Rc3+ - checks the WK and protects lsb x-ray fashion.} 38. Kd6 {38. Kd6 - closer and closer to the BK.} h5 39. Ne6+ Kg8 40. Rg7+ {40. Rg7+ - fork - now material will be even.} Kh8 41. Rxg6 Be4 42. Rh6+ {42 - Rh6+ - another fork.} Kg8 43. Rxh5 Rc6+ 44. Ke5 Bf3 45. Rg5+ Kf7 {45. .... Kf7?? - the losing blunder but such a tempting move.} 46. Nd8+ {46. Nd8+ - a knight fork leaving white permanently up an exchange and a pawn.} Ke7 47. Nxc6+ Bxc6 48. f5 {48. f5 - this pawn will be hard to stop so black resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material leading to Unavoidable Mate.  It really was a tale of a rook winning skewer and a rook winning knight fork.  The lesson here is to watch out for your king being checked on the rank or file by an enemy rook and if that is the case, make sure that there is nothing of value behind it that cannot be defended.  Secondly, watch out for enemy knights that are close to your king on a rank and file with just one space between them.  That knight can check your king and anything else on the end of its l' shape.  Also, if the knight is on an adjacent diagonal square with no spaces between king and enemy knight then you can also get checked.  Your king is safe from knight checks if the enemy knight is just one square adjacent to your king on rank and file and one square apart on the diagonal.  It is worth knowing this to avoid losing heavy material.  I hope you have all had a good read.  Kind regards - Joanne}
