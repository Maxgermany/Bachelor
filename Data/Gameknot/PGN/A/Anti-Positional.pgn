[Opening "Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 {I don't know anything other than the name of Trompovsky's attack. I had just gotten crushed by this same opponent in this same opening so I was eager to get out of the book. } e6 3. Bxf6 gxf6 {This is I suppose anti-positional but I'm thinking I can castle queenside and he will have to since the open file would be dangerous.  It had to be better than the previous crush.} 4. e3 d5 {The e3 is solid but not aggressive.} 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Bb5 Bd7 {Both sides continue to develop.  The f6 pawn prevents Ne5 and may support an e5 push at some time. } 7. Qe2 Qe7 8. Nc3 O-O-O 9. O-O-O {So both sides have castled and now we need to find plans. } a6 10. Bxc6 Bxc6 {I think retreating the bishop would have been better but Nb4 would still allow black the two bishops.  I was a little worried by 10. Bxa6, b7xa6, 11.Qxa6ch, Kb8, 12. Nb5  but I think 12. ..., Qb4 and 13. ..., Qa5 should hold. } 11. Nd2 {Aiming for c5 } e5 12. Nb3 Qe6 {If Nc5 then BxN and black's control of the center should give him a slight advantage.} 13. Rhe1 Bb4 {This pins the knight on c3 and gives Black a threat to double the c pawns and weaken the King position.    } 14. Nc5 {White probably expects BxNc5 since he seems to have a threat on a6, but black can allow it! } Qe7 15. Nxa6 {Black can capture that knight but his castled position is ruined and white's queen may be hard to dislodge so... } Bxc3 {White can save the knight but he will lose the exchange. So... } 16. bxc3 Qa3+ {Black resigns - The knight falls but white's compensation is minimal. }
