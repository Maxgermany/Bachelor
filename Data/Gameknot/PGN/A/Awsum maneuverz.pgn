1. a3 {Classic first move... subtle yet deadly. } d5 {Very bad mistake here. Just asking for trouble. } 2. b3 {This here opens up my right flank for the e2 pawn. } b5 {He falls into my trap. } 3. f4 {Good move here, I am such a genius.} e6 {Ooh, daring but useless. Will produce little fruition. } 4. c3 {A brutal move... their seventh rank is under attack. } Qh4+ {Looks clever but utterly predictable. } 5. g3 {Easy. } Qd8 {He has no choice but to retreat from my onslaught. } 6. g4 {Feeling sorry for the old chap, I give him an easy chance for a checkmate. Queen to h4. } Bb7 {Silly, silly, silly. } 7. b4 {Another daring and tactical move. } d4 {Oooh! A mistake! And to think he still has the chance to checkmate me!} 8. cxd4 {Too easy, once again. } Qxd4 {An anticipated move. Now... watch this. } 9. Nf3 {Ah-ha. Perfect. } Qxa1 {Just as I predicted. He is now vulnerable on the mid-flank with the double rook. } 10. e3 {Moving into position...} Qxb1 {Another silly move. Predictable. } 11. Bxb5+ {Very good - all going to plan. } c6 {... wait for it. } 12. Ne5 {Ah ha! Deadly. } cxb5 {Once again, a bad move. He has underestimated the threat of my right wing pin. } 13. h4 {A staple but ultimately killer advancement. } Bxh1 {Another mistake! } 14. Kf2 {My king moves into the attack...} Na6 {?} 15. Kg1 {Pwned. } Qe4 {Silly, very silly. The threat of my right hook pin left middle is unmistakable. } 16. Qf1 {Great move preventing mate, and setting up my final strike...} Rc8 {Just as I predicted...} 17. Qxb5+ {Tactical prowess. Unpredictable and deadly. } Kd8 {The final mistake of a sad game. } 18. Qd7# {I strike beautifully and the game is over. A well-deserved win against a hard opponent. }
