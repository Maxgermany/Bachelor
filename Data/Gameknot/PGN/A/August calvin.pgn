1. d4 d5 2. e3 {I thought this was intresting. I had never seen it before, but I didn't doubt the skills of a 1350.} Nc6 {More common is Nf3} 3. f4 Nf6 4. Nf3 {This is close to a stonewall position. After the tournament I studied this opening, because It can work quite effectively} Bg4 5. Be2 {And he is already ready to castle} e6 6. O-O Bd6 7. c3 O-O 8. Bd2 {Somehow I could sense a strong kingside attack was coming soon. His pieces looked angled there} g6 {An opponent of mine was studying the game with me after the seccond round and questioned that move. I think the reason was it weakens the knight} 9. Be1 {I knew after 8.Bd2 he would go to e1 then h4.} Qd7 {I didn't want the pin on my knight so if bh4 I could play ne4, even though I end up playing be7 to get pieces on the kingside If he did a tradeoff.} 10. Bh4 Be7 11. Nbd2 Ne8 {I was hoping for a trade off and also be able to replace my knight on g7} 12. Bf2 {Apparently he didn't want to trade off} Ng7 13. h3 Bxf3 {I kinda trapped in my bishop so that's forced} 14. Nxf3 f5 15. Bb5 {Commonly with the stonewall, he wanted to play ne5 and that knight would be kind of irritating} Bf6 {Stopping the knight} 16. Bh4 Bxh4 17. Nxh4 Qe7 18. Nf3 Rab8 19. Ng5 h6 {That was a mistake. Weakening the pawn on g6, but I just really want that knight out of there! But now he is just going to go on e5} 20. Nf3 Rf6 {That was to avoid 21.bxc6 pxc6 22.ne5} 21. Rb1 {A waste of time} a6 22. Bxc6 bxc6 23. Ne5 Qd6 24. Rf3 {That rook lift was good. He is obviously aiming at the weakened g6 pawn} Kh7 25. Qa4 Rb6 {I dont really like the "power pieces on the sixth rank" thing, so i'm trying to re organize my pieces } 26. Qd1 {?} Rf8 {That was a bad move. After rg3, I would need to move back, and wold lose some tempo.} 27. Qe2 Ne8 {That was for puting my rook on g8 to protect in a better spot.} 28. Rg3 Rg8 {Soon I pull ahead after a blunder from him. The only downside, I only have about 25 minutes on my clock. } 29. Qf2 Nf6 {I saw my chance- ne4.} 30. h4 {h4? I'm so glad he missed Ne4!} Ne4 31. Qe1 Nxg3 32. Qxg3 Rg7 {I moved my rook there so c5 would be an option, and I could break his stonewall} 33. Qh3 h5 {That whole plan of his was good he was trying to break my king's defense, or atleast make a hole in it.} 34. Qg3 c5 35. Nf3 c4 {I decided not to capture, and to soon play c5... again. Don't you hate doubled pawns?} 36. Ng5+ Kh6 37. Nf3 Qd8 {I was down to about 10 minutes left on my clock, and was thinking a trade off of queens would be nice to slim the game down to an endgame sooner} 38. Ne5 a5 39. a3 a4 {Don't really know what that was all about accept for trying to play a3 with my pawn} 40. Kh1 {I had only 5-7 minutes left at this point, I figured the reason he did that is to just drain my time until I lose.} Rb5 {Qb8 might have been better, and then rb5. wrong move order} 41. Qf2 c5 42. Kg1 Kh7 43. g3 Qc7 44. Qc2 cxd4 45. exd4 {That exchange was probably good for him because now e6 is a weak spot} Qb7 {better is Qb6} 46. Nf3 {He was lookin' at playing ng5+ and win the pawn} Kh6 47. Ng5 Qb6 {Qa6 is better by far. I was in deep trouble right now. Had only 6 minutes left. I was moving fast, that's probably why I missed it.} 48. Qxa4 Rxb2 {49.rxb2 qxb2 50.nxe6 re7 51.ng5 re1# is a line that I was dreaming would happen} 49. Re1 Rb1 {I am now happy with my positin, but I was down really low on time} 50. Rd1 Rxd1+ 51. Qxd1 {I was hoping for 3-move repetition sometime soon} Qb3 {He was smart enough to not fall for that} 52. Qe1 Qxa3 53. Kh2 Qb2+ 54. Kh3 Re7 55. Nf3 Qc2 {I wanted to play qe4} 56. Ng5 Ra7 57. Qe5 {Threatening mate} Ra8 58. Nf7+ Kh7 59. Qf6 {That is the mistake that threw the game for him. I was relieved.} Qf2 {After that move we agreed to a draw. Ther was no way to stop the 3-move repetition. He could hold it off for a few moves, or do it himself, but it was game over. I was shakin' after that game. This was my first tournament game against an adult and I got a draw. Thank you for watching. Please leave comments. }
