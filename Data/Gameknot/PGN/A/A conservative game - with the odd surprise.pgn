1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 {I decide to remove the pawn...} 3. Qxd4 {...to force the queen out...} Nc6 {...and develop my knight to pressurise her...} 4.

Qe4 Ngxe5 {...so I remove the pawn...} 7. Bb5 Qe7 {...and bring up the queen to free up the e5 knight...} 8. Nc3 Ng6 {...and keep the queen pinned to her file, although I don't know what I was thinking here...} 9. Qxe7+ Ngxe7 {...but I do get the queen-for-queen swap I was loking for...} 10. Bxc6 {...then my opponent removes my knight...} Nxc6 {...but using its twin to remove the queen allowed me to maintain a resonable pawn structure.} 11. Nd5 {The knight eyes up the c7 square...} Bd6 {...so I use the bishop as cover.} 12. Bd2 O-O {Castling gives the king more of a shield...} 13. O-O-O a5 {...so I move up this pawn to contest the b4 square even further...} 14. Nf3 Nb4 {...and I move my knight onto that square, eyeing up a potential check...} 15. Nc3 {...but my opponent spots the danger to cover the target a2 square.} b6 {I move up this pawn to give my other bishop more freedom...} 16.

Ref1 {...but the rook moves out of the way.} Bd5 {Now I pressurise the a2 square further...} 19. a3 {...but the pawn moves up to do so to my knight...} g5 {...but I can't understand why I did this, other than to pressurise my opponent's knight...} 20. Nf5 Na2+ {...so I check the king and also attack the knight...} 21. Nxa2 Bxa2 {...and get the swap, keeping the king stuck thanks to the bishop...} 22. b3 {...but this exposes him...} Bxa3# {...and to my surprise, I move in for the kill, using the other bishop.}
