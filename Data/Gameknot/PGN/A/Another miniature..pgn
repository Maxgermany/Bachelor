[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 c6 2. c3 {This is not a slip. I didn't want to get into the well-known lines, and I play with a scheme in mind. 1. c6 is the only move that makes me think. When playin "my" line, I have to play c3 to be able to defend b2 after Qb6 with Qc2, that is a kind of developing move. Black will try to play Bf5, and there it comes a well-known battle white can win. So, I tried to play the "countermove" as early as black opened the way for the queen to b6. Of course, white has other good ways to defend the pawn, but they lead the game outside of the boundaries I feel confortable with. } d5 {Yes, symmetry is one of the black strategies, but I know I will get the better of it, in the long run. } 3. Bf4 {The London bishop, I'd call it. A target, but...} Bg4 {Better was, in this case, Bf5, so white has to think how to respond to Qb6. I have to make black "pay" for his mistake, but... how?} 4. Nd2 {The usual move. I'm not in a real hurry to throw away the bishop, and of course, f3 is dangerous, despite the push on d4 to follow. } e6 {Very funny. } 5. h3 {Normal was Ng-f3, but let's see where does it leads. Anyway, this is an "agenda move" on my scheme. } Bf5 6. Ngf3 {Nothing had happened. h3 could be a loss of tempo, but it does actually prepares g4. I am planning to castle queenside and pawnstorm black's kingside. Quite obvious...} c5 {This opens further possibilities on the queenside. Now I miss e3...} 7. e3 cxd4 8. exd4 {The "standard" reply. This keeps white's queenside very solid while avoiding ideas like e5 to black. But now I'm thinking that Nxd4 was not bad either. } Nc6 9. g4 {Kingside pawnstorm. As planned. } Bg6 {If Be4, I'd be glad to exchange. } 10. h4 {Necessary. Ne5 is in sight, but I have to keep the black queen out of h4. } h6 {Making room for the bishop. This "so powerful" bishop is, in this kind of position, almost useless. White knows how to play against it (or it seems so far). } 11. g5 {? Mistake. I have to push h5 first, so he can't play h5, here (I remembered a minute later). } hxg5 {Black, fortunately, doesn't see it as the best option, and went on with this. } 12. Nxg5 {If f6, Nxe6, Qe7, Bh3, and white can shield the king and defend the knight - or so it seems to me!} Be7 13. Ndf3 {Qg4 was the move. If Bf5, Qg3. } Qa5 {Black counterattacks on the queenside. This is a great moment. } 14. Ne5 {Plan: h5. Of course, if f6, forking the knights, NxBg6. } Nxe5 15. dxe5 {Maybe a mistake. This is the standard move in this line. The purpose is to block black's kinside developement. I'm not sure this has any meaning now, but Nf6 is impossible for black now. } f6 {I'll explain: } 16. Nxe6 {This is the reason. And can you see what? White is threatening Bb5+. Because if QxB, Nc7+, winning the queen. But black can answer Kf7. The position would be very similar to the game's. } d4 {Black throws in a desperate attack. And now black is right: in two tempos, black will check me and I'll lose. So I have to think it twice. Nxd4, Re8, and I am defending. No good. Qxd4 seems ok. But I wanted to be nastier. } 17. Qg4 Kf7 {Wisely. Black could have played dxc, but after QxB+...} 18. Bc4 {Now this is getting a real grimp. } f5 {B somewhere, instead, could have been better, so to leave some room to the king after the double check that is coming. } 19. Nc7+ Kf8 20. Qxg6 {I still have a spare move after black's check, and I use it this way. Black has mate in one, and there is nothing he can do to avoid it. My opponene resigned here, I show the continuation. } Nh6 21. Bxh6 Rxh6 22. Qf7# {}
