1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I think I will leave the title for you readers to try and suss out, I can't and I need your help!  Anyhow, this was my 50th game against the Master Mater and I hate to say it but I played loads better against him in my first game and that was when I had a Class C rating!  Here I made the mistake of using the analyse board feature but not analysing it far enough!  Anyhow, on with the game where I kick off with e4.} h6 {1. ..... h6 - Freddy just lurves these unusual openings!} 2. d4 a6 3. Nc3 {3. Nc3 - so far, so sensible development.} e6 4. Nf3 d5 5. e5 {5. e5 - I try and cramp the Master Mater for style.....} Ne7 6. Bd3 Nd7 7. Be3 b6 8. Qd2 c5 {8. ...... c5 - but it ain't gonna last cos Freddy now undermines my pawn structure.} 9. Be2 Nc6 10. Na4 cxd4 11. Bxd4 {11. Bxd4 - now Freddy has a knight on a decent square and in fact, Freddy's two horsies are ganging up on that e5 pawn.} Qc7 12. Qe3 b5 13. Nb6 {13. Nb6??? - eeek, eeek and treble eeek!  I will have knightmares about this for years to come.  Now, the move looked OK at first.  I did spot 13...... Nxd4 and the family fork on c2 after I play 14. NxR but I thought that I could get away with it by moving Henry to d2 and if 15......NxQ, 16.  NxQ+.  But I bally would have to overlook 15...... Bb4+ wouldn't I?  Doh and Double Doh!} Nxd4 14. Qxd4 Qxb6 15. Qxb6 Nxb6 {15. ..... Nxb6 - voila, now I am a whole piece to the bad against the Master Mater.  But, I do take his advice this time and play on until I am facing further ruinous loss of material.  The rest is an exercise in how to polish off a player who is a piece down.} 16. O-O-O Nd7 17. Rhe1 {17. Rhe1 - I try and put my remaining army on the best squares possible but I am still mad at myself for falling for such a tactical shot!} Bc5 18. Ref1 b4 19. Bd3 O-O 20. Rde1 f6 21. exf6 Rxf6 {21. ....... Rxf6 - I decided to exchange off my weak e5 pawn.  When you are a piece down, try and exchange as many pawns as possible.  Remember K and B alone cannot deliver mate against bare king.} 22. Re2 Bb7 23. Nd2 Bd6 24. g3 {24. g3 - still feel like I am going through the motions.} e5 25. Ree1 Raf8 26. f3 a5 27. Kd1 Nc5 28. Be2 {28. Be2 - trying to prevent piece exchanges but Freddy has ways of making me bend to his will!} a4 29. Kc1 Bc6 30. Kb1 {30. Kb1 - Henry shuffles around in his castle, at least he is safe (as safe as he can be against Freddy) for the moment.  I do prolong the game beyond 30 moves which is what Freddy is encouraging us U1900s to do.  Boy it is torture!} Ne6 31. Bd1 e4 32. fxe4 {32. fxe4 - another set of pawns is exchanged but, oh dear, so are some pieces.} Rf6xf1 33. Rxf1 dxe4 34. Rxf8+ {34. Rxf8+ - it was either exchange rooks or allow Freddy's rook to dominate the f column.} Bxf8 35. Be2 e3 36. Nf1 Bc5 37. Bc4 {37. Bc4 - inching towards the 40 move mark .....} Kf7 {37. ......Kf7 - hmm, Freddy, I wonder if Bf3 would have finished off the game a bit quicker?} 38. Be2 Kf6 {38. ...... Kf6 - Freddy could have played Nd4 here.} 39. Kc1 Nd4 {39. ...... Nd4 - he does here.} 40. Kd1 Nxe2 41. Kxe2 Bb5+ 42. Ke1 b3 {42. ...... b3 - Freddy invites the exchange of another pair of pawns but the idea behind this will soon become apparent.} 43. axb3 Bb4+ 44. c3 a3 {44. ...... a3 - I can capture Freddy's dsb but I will not be able to prevent the Wicked Witch of the West making an appearance and carting off Henry to the Hospitality Quarters of her castle and subjecting him to goodness knows what every night ....  I decided to spare Henry those horrors and waved the white flag.  I am now playing my 51st game against him and I am hoping to fine tune Operation Joblock!}
