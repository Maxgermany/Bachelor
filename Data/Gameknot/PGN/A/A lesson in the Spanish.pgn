1. e4 {This was Freddy's proof that 7...Bd6 is not such a bad move really.  I still think it sucks but I have to admit that he makes it work in this game!  He played "conditional moves" up to that point, then we got down to business.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Bb7 7. d3 Bd6 8. c3 O-O 9. Bg5 h6 10. Bh4 {so far as in my Oxford and District League game against Heather Lang.  Now Freddy varies, not allowing my sac on g5} Be7 11. Nbd2 {so I continue with my standard development} Nh5 {and Freddy puts the question to my B, heading for a powerful outpost on f4} 12. Bxe7 {naturally, I swap it off as it has no other useful moves.} Qxe7 13. Re1 Nf4 14. Nf1 {? Freddy commented during that game that 14. d4 was much better at this point.  My N soon completes its journey to g3 but then swaps off on e4, which it could have done from d2, so I'd wasted two tempi on that manoeuvre.} Na5 {as anticipated in my game against Heather (but it didn't materialise in that game)} 15. Bc2 f5 {! vigorously played.  He doesn't only play "rope-a-dope"!} 16. Ng3 fxe4 17. Nxe4 Qe6 {Now I spot an "opportunity", that in retrospect was nothing like one, and quickly go down in ignominy.  Instead, I should have looked carefully at what Freddy was planning and considered how to avoid mate on g2!} 18. b4 {?? hoping to skewer K and Q on the diagonal but Black is way ahead of me here} Qg4 {!!} 19. Ng3 {?  19.g3 was better according to Freddy} Bxf3 20. gxf3 {? 20. Qxf3 was not much better because of 20...Nh3  followed by 21. ... Rxf3 but now Freddy announced Mate in 3} Qh3 21. Bb3+ Kh8 {and now there is nothing to prevent ...Qg2#, so I play a token move to allow him the satisfaction.} 22. Rxe5 Qg2# {}
