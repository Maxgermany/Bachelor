1. d4 {I usally do the king's pawn but I wanted to do something diffrent.} c5 {!? I have never faced this before.} 2. dxc5 {So I try to accept it unsure what is going to happen next.} Qa5+ {I see. An opening trap. But the queen is out early.} 3. Nc3 {Maybe a little too early.} Qxc5 4. Qd5 {I didn't think of this first but it seems Ok.} d6 {?! Strange.} 5. Be3 {Attacking the queen, again. } Qxd5 {Black does an exchange of queens very early. Once again, mabye a little too early.} 6. Nxd5 {THreatening a fork on c7.} Nf6 {Black falls into the trap. Barley noticed that was going to happen.} 7. Nc7+ {Any person would've noticed this fork so it is surprising that my opponent did not.} Kd8 8. Nxa8 {I won't be able to get my knight out now.} Nd5 {Just as I expected.} 9. Bxa7 {Black didn't notice that.} Nb4 {It's the Nifty Nxc2+ he's aiming at now. He thinks he can pay me back after the Nc7+ and Nxa8. But I'm not falling for it.} 10. O-O-O {Now O-O-O might seem plain, but it creates a pin on the d-file.} Nb8c6 {Now black is starting to think, but not after my next bit.} 11. Bc5 {Ooops! I made a mistake here. The missing key was Nxa2+, and I think he would make that next move.} Nxa2+ {Yes for sure.} 12. Kb1 {Now the knight is stuck, but never mind.} Ncb4 {A dogey move.} 13. Bb6+ {I like playing checks.} Kd7 {A standard square. And oh, I wish my white-squared bishop was out.} 14. Nc7 {Getting my knight out.} e5 {!? I don't see the point.} 15. e4 {e4 was simply perfect if black would let me play my next move. Also makes Nf3 more intresting and normal.} f6 {Now that's a pretty fine move, but it doesn't stop my next move.} 16. Bb5+ {Great. Now hopefully I will be able to mate with 3 minor pieces working together, just like Legall's Mate.} Ke7 17. c3 {The knight's stuck, and the threat is cxb4, Kxa2 or Nd5+} Nc6 {Now I can do what I planned.} 18. Nd5+ {Here comes the dogey check.} Ke6 19. Bc4 {Here is a double threat and a fork.} Nxc3+ {Now I can make a check followed by a check.} 20. Nxc3+ {Amazing.} Kd7 21. Nf3 {I add one more piece.} d5 {?? A blunder.} 22. Rxd5+ {I ought to do it with my rook.And Check.} Bd6 {Forced. But Nb5 wins.} 23. Nb5 {Exactly.} Ke7 {The first thing to do is if a piece is pinned (for example, the bishop on d6), and there are 2 pieces controlling it (like the rook and the knight), and the oppisite side only has 1 ( the king), usally the target has best to run (like to e7).} 24. Nxd6 {Now I am 11 points up, but Be6 saves the game, for a bit.} Be6 {I cannot help that to happen. And there is no defence.} 25. Nf5+ {Or maybe there is, a little brain could work out some clever exuses. } Kf7 {A very bad sqaure.} 26. Rd7+ {Now the bishop on e6 is pinned, so it cannot take my rook. Whichever way black escapes from check, I will capture next move with Bxe6.} Ke8 {Bxe6 protects my rook.} 27. Bxe6 {I have now got 3 minor pieces and 1 majoir pieces working together, but I've got 1 minor and major piece snozzling in the cornes. But never mind. Black has to deal with the Rd8*.} g6 {Uh-oh, that spoils my plan for a bit. But it does allow something else.} 28. Ng7+ {I think that's proper.} Kf8 {Forced. But there comes another sparkling spectacular mate...} 29. Bc5+ {Bc5...which coudl've been mate without that knight on c6, but that makes no diffrence,} Ne7 30. Bxe7+ {A wonderful check using a rook, a knight and two bishops.} Kxg7 {Planning a discovered check.} 31. Bd8+ {That was my only square that came in mind. D8.} Kh6 {He had a choice there. E8 or H6.} 32. Bxf6 {The two bishops look very strong.} Rc8 {Are you sure that is a good square?} 33. Bg5+ {Aha. Here comes the mate in 2. A fine bishop check.} Kh5 {Forced. Shame g5 was blocked.} 34. g4# {A very high-standard mate by 2 bishops, a knight and a pawn.}
