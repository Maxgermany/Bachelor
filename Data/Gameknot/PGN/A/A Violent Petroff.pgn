1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {I rarely ever see the Petroff, and I don't really know what to do against it.} 3. Nxe5 d6 {3...Nxe4 doesn't work.  4.Qe2 wins a pawn.} 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. dxc3 {Opening it up for the bishops.  Capturing towards the center is also logical, but I wanted fast development.} h6 {Kinda passive, but prevents some future threats against h7.} 7. Be3 Be7 8. Qd2 {Threatening in some cases to sac the bishop on h6.} Be6 9. Be2 a6 10. Nd4 Bd7 11. Bc4 {Increasing my central control and aiming at f7.} O-O 12. Bd3 {Threatening Bxh6 and then, if he recaptures, I take with the queen threatening mate on h7.  Of course, this is an obvious threat, but the bishop is well placed in any case.} c5 {Aggressive, but my attack should be faster.} 13. Nf3 f5 {Defending against the aforementioned threat.  This move does carry weaknesses with it, though.  I think 13...h5 might have been better, though white still has good resources.} 14. Bc4+ {Leaving black with only one reasonable option, because 14...Kh8 loses to 15.Bxh6.} Kh7 15. Bf4 Bc6 {Threatening to double my pawns with Bxf3 while defending d6 at the same time.} 16. Bd5 Bf6 17. Qd3 {Avoiding the tempting 17.Bxh6, because 17...Bxd5 loses material for white.} g6 18. Bxc6 Nxc6 19. O-O-O {Loading up on the d-pawn.  Black is on the defensive.  } Be5 20. Qe3 Bxf4 21. Qxf4 {Maintaining pressure, forcing black to respond to threats.  } Rf6 22. Rhe1 {Seizing control of an important file.  In some lines I can make threats on the 7th rank because black's king is hemmed in be pawns in front.} Qa5 {Now it gets complicated.  Can white get away with taking the pawn on d6?  He attacks the rook after Rxd6 and forces ...Rxd6, after which Qxd6, but is it worth letting black take the a-pawn?} 23. Rxd6 Rxd6 24. Qxd6 Rd8 {Creating some glaring threats based on the mate on a-1.  It doesn't work, though.} 25. Re7+ Nxe7 26. Qxe7+ Kg8 {At this point I was thinking draw, but can I get more?} 27. Qe6+ Kf8 28. Qf6+ Ke8 29. Qe6+ Kf8 30. Ne5 {I'll try for the win.} Qc7 31. Qf6+ Ke8 {Now here's the critical part.} 32. Qh8+ Ke7 33. Qg7+ {I can sense some sort of win ahead, but I'm not sure of it yet.  I've got to keep the initiative and make forcing moves so he can't coordinate his queen and rook.} Kd6 {Or else the queen is gone.} 34. Qf6+ {Continuing with my theme of forcing moves.} Kd5 35. c4+ Ke4 {I had to make a tough decision here.  Check with the pawn or reposition? } 36. Qe6 Qd6 {The idea is that Qxd5 loses to pawn checks that force the king away from the queen.  However, I now have a forced win.} 37. f3+ {Black is lost. } Ke3 {If 37...Kf4, then 38.Nxg6+ mates in a couple of moves.} 38. Ng4+ {Only forced moves for the rest of the game.} Kd4 39. c3+ Kd3 40.
