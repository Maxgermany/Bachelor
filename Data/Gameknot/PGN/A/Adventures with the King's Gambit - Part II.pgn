1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Offering the beloved king's gambit, hoping that my opponent will accept it. } d6 {According to the opening books this seems to be quite a rare move to decline the gambit, however one that I encounter quite often here on GameKnot, especially when playing blitz games. The most common alternatives to 2... exf4 are the Falkbeer countergambit (2... d5) or the classical king's gambit declined (2... Bc5). } 3. Nf3 {Playing just like the opponent would have taken the pawn. If he does now, it transposes to the king's gambit accepted with the well-known Fischer defence (normal move-order: 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6), so this is one more offer to accept the gambit. } Nc6 {Okay, it seems my opponent doesn't like the KGA. } 4. Bb5 {Doesn't really do anything good besides pinning the knight, which won't hurt my opponent. Being greedy, I guess the idea behind this move was winning the pawn e5 (idea: 4... some dummy move like h6, 5. fxe5 dxe5 6. Nxe5). However, d4 or Nc3 would have been much better. } Nf6 {Attacking e4... } 5. Nc3 {... so I have to defend it. fxe4 would also have been an attractive option, which may continues: 5... dxe5 6. Nxe5 Qd4 7. Nxc6 Qxe4+ 8. Qe2 Qxe2+ 9. Kxe2 a6 10. Ba4 Bd7 with a small advantage for White. } Be7 {Prepares castling king's side. } 6. d4 {Probably not a bad move, but this time I *really* could have taken the pawn to gain advantage: 6. fxe5 dxe5 7. Nxe5 and the pawn is won this time. } O-O {Time to open the center! } 7. dxe5 dxe5 {Instead of freeing up the d-File, Fritz suggests 7... Ng4. } 8. O-O {? I could have won a pawn with 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. fxe5 Ng4 10. Bxc6 bxc6 11. h3 Nh6 etc. } Ng4 9. h3 {? Overlooking the fork on f2. } Bc5+ 10. Kh1 {The only sane choice. } Nf2+ {And now I resigned, assuming that my queen is lost. I thought taking back with the rook is no option, as Black would take my queen on d1 then - not noticing that it is defended by my knight on c3! So I should have kept on playing! After 11. Rxf2 Bxf2 (Qxd1? 12. Nxd1 Bxf2 13. Nxf2 and White is up in material) black is better - Fritz rates the position as -0.91 - but it isn't completely lost so far for White. Conclusion: I shouldn't react that impulsively to opponent's moves, no single game has ever been won by resigning. }
