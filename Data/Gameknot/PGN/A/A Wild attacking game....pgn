[Opening "Vienna game (C25)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {I love the Vienna game, specifically the vienna gambit when black responds Nf6, as it's like the King's gambit, but without the possibility of Qh4  for black...} Bc5 {Oh well.  Looks like a vanilla vienna game, then.} 3. Bc4 {I'm still hoping to play f4 in this position, as the extra pressure on black's kingside is something I'm hopeful for.} Nc6 4. d3 d6 5. f4 {?!  Here it is.  Nf3 would have been solid, albeit boring, but f4 is not optimal here.  rt4sm demonstrates why with a quite lively move:} Bxg1 {!  This wins a pawn.  While it looks like it may be rough, exchanging an active bishop for a knight at home, this is, I believe the best move in the position.  Observe why.} 6. Rxg1 {This is forced -- I considered Qh5 here, but black can defend against any of white's threats, and can save the bishop to boot.  White must take.} Qh4+ {And so, black wins a pawn.  White would love to just play g3, but with the rook no longer protecting the pawn on h2, black is going to win it.} 7. Kf1 {Of course, Ke2 would have been a disaster, and Kd2 blocks the bishop in.} Bg4 {A nice in-between move that forces the queen to move.} 8. Qe1 {The best square for the queen, offering a trade.} Qxh2 {!?  Trading would give black a solid game.  Instead, the pawn grabbing allows white a large amount of counterplay, but black has a strong attack as well!} 9. Nd5 {Here it comes!  The first threat: Nxc7 } O-O-O {!  The best move, as this gets the king out of the center.  Castling on opposite sides often foreshadows attacks on opposite sides of the board.} 10. Be3 {Pointing the bishop at the enemy's king.  Maybe Qc3 is worth considering here, but it runs into the tactical problem of Be2 , which looks pretty strong for black.} exf4 {One of those moves that players around my level LOVE to make -- wait until an opponent moves a piece, then immediately force it to move again.  But this doesn't get an exclam, because after the recapture...} 11. Bxf4 {White tempos the queen.} Qh5 {The best square, allowing the queen scope along the 5th rank.} 12. Qc3 {! Aggressive!  Threatening Qxg7 and also pressuring the black king.} f6 {Mandatory, as Nf6 allows white to win his pawn back.} 13. b4 {Again, very aggressive.  This is maybe the critical point in the game, where white is trying to make something happen.  My idea is to kick out the knight on c6 and try to mate black down the c-file.} Nge7 {Very good.  Threatening to swap knights and blunt white's attack.} 14. Nxc7 {!?  Very aggressive, but very good!  Black will be under a lot of pressure once he recaptures with his king.} Kxc7 15. b5 {Yes!  This has the fantastic threat of N-moves, Bf7 , winning the queen!  This is a critical point in this game for white and black both.} Ng6 {Defending against the threat, and hitting the Bf4, forcing white to address that counterthreat.  Both sides have a great attack, and it's a question of whose will get there first.} 16. Bd5 {???????  Augh!  No!  No no no no no!  This was one of the worst moves I could've made.  I just gave up a bishop for free, with no compensation.  The Bf4 was very important, as it helped hold down defense of the kingside.  How could I just ignore it?  I mistakenly thought that after I played Bxc6 on my 17th, black would play bxc6 and I would terrorize him with my queen, advanced pawn, and possibly the rook down the b-file, forcing a victory.  It's amazing what even good players can overlook.} Nxf4 {Winning the bishop, and hence the game.} 17. Bxc6 {I continue with my unsound plan, completely unaware of the defense made possible by black's 11th move...} Qc5 {!  Stopping any threat that white has, and effectively ending the game.  White has nothing better than to exchange queens and simply go to a piece-down endgame.  I played on for a few more moves, but I could have resigned here.} 18. Qa5+ {Desperately trying to keep the firepower on the board, and hoping for a horrid mistake like b6.} Kb8 {With his king in a safe place, black suddenly has the horrible threat of Be2 !, winning two rooks.} 19. d4 {Aaah, I think, if I can play b6, I can play for a sneaky sneaky mate...} Qxd4 {Renewing the old threat.  Unfortunately, now I see that 20. b6 runs into Be2  21. Ke2 Qxg1  22. Kd2 Qxb6, nullifying the threat and winning a rook.} 20. Re1 {Defending the e2 square...} Be2+ {! But simply not enough times.  After Rxe2, black simply had an overwhelming material advantage, plus the queen will still defend the a7-g1 diagonal.  White has a huge disadvantage and no threats, so I resigned.  Still, it was an incredible attacking game by both sides until the disastrous miscalculation on my part at move 16.  Now Rob is #2 and I am #3, but I plan on changing that soon!  Look out for the rematch, buddy!}
