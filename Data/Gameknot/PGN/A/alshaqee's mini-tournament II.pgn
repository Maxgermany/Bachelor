1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Bd7 4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 5. c4 Nc6 6. O-O g6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bg7 9. Nc2 Nf6 10. Nc3 O-O 11. f3 Rac8 {hereabouts things get a little boring with a lot of manuevering, especially with the knights.} 12. Ne3 Rfe8 13. Bd2 Qd8 14. Rc1 Nd7 15. Ne2 Nc5 16. b4 Ne6 17. Bc3 {what is interesting is that the computer does not consider this a mistake!  Truthfully, white can regain the pawn.} Bxc3 18. Rxc3 Nxb4 {19 Qb3 would have regained the pawn since the white queen can nab the b7 pawn and get out of there alive.} 19. Qa4 Nc6 20. Rb1 Nc5 {more manuevering occurrs now as black makes an effort to make something out of his extra pawn.} 21. Qc2 b6 22. Rd1 Qc7 23. Nd5 Qb7 24. Ng3 Kg7 25. f4 {white gears up for a kingside attack.} e6 26. Ne3 {the knights and their possible tactic f5+ must be respected} Red8 27. Ra3 a5 {not falling for the cheapo 27 ... Nb4?? 28 Qb2+} 28. f5 Nb4 29. Qf2 Qe7 {the computer would have played 29 ... Nxe4 but I judged the position too dangerous to dare to do that.} 30. Ng4 Qg5 31. h3 h5 32. fxg6 fxg6 33. Qb2+ e5 34. Ne3 {I thought he might go in for 34 Nf2 so as to protect the "e" pawn.   After that I was thinking in terms of playing ... Nc5-e6-f4} h4 35. Ngf5+ {white has to smash that kingside or die doing so.} gxf5 36. Nxf5+ Kh7 37. Qe2 Ne6 {this required some thought and woodshifting on my big board!  the main idea was 38 g3 Nd4! (a hard move to find!) 39 Nxd4 exd4 40 gxh4 Qe5+ 41 Kh1 Re8! which is the key to winning.  g3 by white had to be reckoned with and an answer found to it.} 38. Rxd6 Nf4 39. Qf2 Rxd6 40. Nxd6 Rg8 {the queens are coming off the board and black will be able to hang onto enough pawns to win.}
