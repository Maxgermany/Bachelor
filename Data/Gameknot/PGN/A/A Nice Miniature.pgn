[Opening "Benko gambit half accepted (A57)"]

1. d4 {In my younger days I never opened with this move. It has the reputation of being less aggressive than 1. e4, probably undeservedly.} Nf6 {The most common reply. It is my usual reply as well, although I am tossing around the idea of switching to the Slav, as I have been having trouble against it recently.} 2. c4 {I've also played 2. Bg5, although my results with it have been less than wonderful, to say the least.} c5 3. d5 b5 {I used to find this scary, but my recent results against it have been encouraging.} 4. cxb5 a6 5. e3 {Personally I think accepting the gambit here is too dangerous. In this line White is willing to give back the pawn, but wants to make Black work for it.} e6 {Much to my surprise, the Gameknot analyzer considers this to be not merely an inaccuracy, but a mistake. The machine prefers 5. … ab5 and calls it even.} 6. dxe6 fxe6 {I don't think Black's position is that terrible here. He has eliminated White's central pawn and has a majority of pawns in the center, although at the cost of weakening the King side. IF Black is careful, this shouldn't be a big problem. But as this game demonstrates, that's a big if.} 7. Nc3 d5 {This is a natural enough move, although other moves, such as 7. … Bb7 and 7. … Be7 have been tried with success.} 8. Nf3 Bd6 {In view of White's next move, 8. … Be7 probably would have been a better try.} 9. e4 {Not a move I would have considered except for when I stumbled across the games Tatai vs. Bellon Lopez and Solonzhenkin vs Bistrikova, both of which led to victories for White.} Nxe4 {The point of White's last move is that capturing the e pawn is too dangerous. Best is probably 9. … Bc7 as in Tatai vs. Bellon Lopez or the ignominious retreat 9. … as recommended by the Gameknot analyzer. 9. … Nbd7 was tried in Solozhenkin vs. Bistrikova, but this simply drops a pawn without much compensation.} 10. Nxe4 dxe4 11. Ng5 O-O 12. Qh5 {I thought this move was natural enough, but 12. Bc4 was stronger. My Smallfish analyzer evaluates the position as +1.1 after that, as opposed to +0.5 after 12. Qh5.} h6 {Forced.} 13. Nxe4 Be7 {Finally the Bishop retreats to where it should have been all along.} 14. Be3 {It would have been nice to be able to play 14. Nxc5, but White is embarrassed after 14. … Rf5. At any rate, White's knight already has designs on Black's King and is not to be distracted by the pickin's on the Queen side. Smallfish prefers here 14. Qg6 Qe8 15. Qxe8 Rxe8 16. Be3.} Qa5+ {The Gameknot analyzer passed this over without comment, but Smallfish says it is much worse than 14. … ab5. After Black's move in the game, Smallfish puts White at +1.5 as opposed to +0.2 after 14. … ab5.} 15. Bd2 Qb6 {The problem with this move is that now White has d3 for his Bishop. Best was the ignominious retreat 15. … Qd8} 16. Qg6 {Strong enough, one would think, but Smallfish found 16. Bxh6! The point is that on 16. … gh6, then 17. Qg6+ Kh8, 18. Qxh6+ Kg8, 19. Qg6+ Kh8, 20. O-O-O and Black is helpless against the dual threats of Rd5! and Rd3} Kh8 {A bad blunder which loses immediately. Black has to give up a pawn with 16. … Nd7} 17. Bd3 {Strong enough, one would think, but again I missed a stronger move: 17. … Bc3! I was fixated on the possible Bishop sac on h6.} c4 18. Nf6 {I gotta say, it felt pretty good to play this move. I haven't played anything so pretty in a long time!}
