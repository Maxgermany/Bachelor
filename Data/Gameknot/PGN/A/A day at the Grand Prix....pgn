[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. f4 {Another way to control the center; to me this system is the only way, to justify Nf3... I like to call this the Grand Prix attack, because it savours all the good things from several sytems for white... Of course, a prompt 2. ... d5 will be met with 3. e5... After 2. Nc3, I would play g6, and Bg7... Being black, of course...} d6 3. Nf3 e6 4. g3 Nf6 5. d3 Nc6 6. c3 Be7 7. Bg2 O-O 8. O-O {Let us not argue about the play so far. Both players have reached some form of development, white having slightly more space; black's action should lie on the queens wing, and try and disrupt the center from there...} e5 {It is true, that white might consider e5 in the near future... But this will not break up the center very soon...} 9. f5 {Opening a diagonal, whilst disrupting Bc8... It will take black some time to untangle this...} h6 {Of course, the best way to handle this is 9. ... d5 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Qe2 etc... Whites f-pawn, however, is invulnarable for now...} 10. h4 {Sheer bluff... The plan is, after Kf2, Be3, Rh1, fire up some attack against a cramped Kings wing, sac some piece, and break it open...} Qc7 {Black clearly doesn't know, what to think of it... But why still not d5, exd5, Nxd5 etc.? Or at least Qb6?} 11. Nh2 {Opening up another diagonal, and cover g4 in the process... I've played this a million times...} Rd8 {Still struggling with d5...} 12. g4 Nh7 13. g5 {This would have been a great time for white, to pause and take a look at things... My clock was at some seven minutes, my opponent was already some three minutes behind in time... Had I done so, I surely would have found 13. Qe1! Qb6 14. Kh1! followed by Qg3, and pick it up from there... But I wanted to beat him to g5...} hxg5 14. hxg5 Bxg5 15. Bxg5 Nxg5 16. Qh5 Nh7 {All pretty much forced...} 17. Ng4 Qe7 {The position is dead equal... Black is going for the exchange on g5...} 18. Nd2 Qg5 {There we have it... After 19. Qxg5 Nxg5 20. Kf2 f6! white's attack grinds to a halt... We do not want that...} 19. Nf6+ {Desperate situations call for desperate measures... Figuring, that four of black's pieces are idle, plus I was way ahead in time - black had some two minutes left - made me justify this sacrifice... Sadly, it is incorrect... But I can at least keep the Queens on the board... To me, this has Mikael Tal written all over it...} Qxf6 {Had he played 19. ... gxf6, I would have resigned, probably, or try 20. Qxg5 fxg5 21. Kf2, and attack along the h-file...} 20. Nf3 {Blocking g5, step one...} g6 {Black starts wandering, 20. ... Qh6 is more then sufficient... But black was running out of time...} 21. fxg6 Qxg6 22. Qh4 {So far, so good... We are attacking Rd8, and blocking Ne7... Now Kf2, Rh1...} Be6 {Connecting rooks, development done... After 22. ... Kg7! (threatens Rh8) white can stop hoping...} 23. Kf2 {Forced, and what I wanted...} Kh8 {Black has a lot of ways to win this, Kg7 for starters... But this is not one of them...} 24. Rfh1 {Again, forced... But still playing my plan...} Rdg8 {The best way, to win this is 24. ... f6! (after Rag1, Qf7!) 25. Bh3 Bxh3 26. Rxh3 Rd7 27. Rah1 Rg8, and white is out of moves... Black thinks, he can win time by playing Rg8 up front...} 25. Rag1 {Sadly not, and all of a sudden black's Queen gets in the way... Black's only hope lies in 25. ... Rg7! 26. Bh3 Qf6 27. Qxf6 Nxf6 28. Bxe6+ Kg8 29. Bb3, and we're back at equal...} f6 {Right move, wrong time... One move ago, this was winning... Now it loses immediately...} 26. Bh3 {Relentless...} Qe8 {Fallen in greed... Giving up the Queen could have saved black, after 26. ... Qxg1 (with check) 27. Nxg1 with lots of fighting chances, and two qualities for the Queen, in a complex position...} 27. Qxh7+ {Bam!!! White finishes in great champion style... A Queen sac, like Tal made in his early days...} Kxh7 28. Bxe6+ {I figured this would be enough for now; I thought I had him, forgetting Bf5 double check and mate... Of course, he gave up... It is still mate after Qh5, Rxh5... A nearly perfect execution...}
