1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This draw seems a bit of a let down after the high one against Expert dynamic_dv.  But in life you sometimes have to take the rough with the smooth.  I have to say that my opponent did once have a gameknot rating of 1883 so he was a former Class A player before he suffered from timeoutitis which brought his rating down to what it is now.  I got into trouble in the middle game and lost a pawn.  Luckily I somehow got it back but unfortunately Henry found himself in perpetual thrall to the Wicked Witch of the West so there seemed nothing better than to concede a low draw and as a result a 7.8 point rating penalty.  Anyhow my opponent kicks off with a d4 opening.} d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bf4 {3. Bf4 - a Trompo methinks.} Bg4 4. h3 Bxf3 5. exf3 {5. exf3 - a B for N trade trying to bust up my opponent's kingside.} e6 6. Bb5 {6. Bb5 - pin.} Nge7 7. c3 a6 8. Bd3 {8. Bd3 - white's lsb retreats after my a pawn puts the question to him.} Ng6 9. Bxg6 fxg6 {9. ........ fxg6? - in retrospect i think it would have been much better to have taken with the other pawn as Henry will soon find life very hot for him.} 10. O-O Bd6 11. Bxd6 Qxd6 {11. ....... Qxd6 - bishop trade.} 12. Nd2 O-O {12. .... Henry moves towards the kingside but is he safe?} 13. Qb3 Rab8 {13. ....... Rab8 - to defend hanging b pawn.} 14. Rfe1 Rfe8 15. Re3 {15. Re3 - preparing to double rooks and bear down on that weak backward e6 pawn - you will only need one guess as to who is one of the defenders?  Yet again Glenda is not a very happy bunny.} e5 {15. ..... e5 - a bid for liquidation of this weakness.} 16. Rae1 Kf8 {16. ...... Kf8 - Henry helps in the defense of e8 to prepare a e5/d4 pawn trade.} 17. dxe5 Rxe5 18. Re3xe5 Nxe5 {18. ....... Nxe5 - I feel a little better after getting rid of my weakie e pawn, but my opponent has a shock in store for me.} 19. c4 {19. c4 - a very nasty pawn break which will lead to me losing a pawn and having an inferior position to boot.} c6 20. cxd5 cxd5 {20. ...... cxd5 - on the plus side a passer on the d file, on the minus side an isolani on the d file which is now defended solely by Glenda - poor gal.} 21. Rd1 Qc6 {21. ....... Qc6 - Glenda is reduced to being a mere pawn, eek!} 22. Nf1 Rd8 {22. ..... Rd8 - Glenda at least relieves the b8 rook of defensive duty of b7 and so the rook wisely lines up behind the passed pawn.  The nearer that passer gets to Glendadom the more passive that white rook is gonna be, that thought does cheer me up a bit!} 23. Qb4+ Kf7 {23. ..... Kf7 - brave Henry stays near the centre.} 24. Ne3 b5 {24. ...... b5 - the humble foot soldier relieves Glenda of defending him!} 25. Qh4 {25. Qh4!! - Nasty nasty fork,  I must avoid losing my rook on d8 so the h7 pawn is doomed.  Still it does take that bally Witch out of play for a bit - can I take advantage of it?  We shall see.} Rd7 26. Qxh7 d4 {26. ...... d4 - I must try and do something positive or I can kiss 18 rating points goodbye.} 27. Nf1 {27. Nf1 - guarding d2.} Qc2 {27. ....... Qc2 - would you believe it?  Glenda the Defender has had enough of being on the first three ranks, she gets on that broomstick of hers, that Nimbus 2000 which has been further modernised to include a Satnav.  Arriving on the square of her choice, c2, an automated female voice states "You have reached your destination!"  That destination is in the ENEMY CAMP, a terrain as hostile as the Expert's Playing Field (a Safari).  The WR however moves to d2 and so she must move again, but no problem, she reprograms the square c4 into that precious contraption and hits out at the h2 pawn.} 28. Rd2 Qc4 29. f4 Nc6 {29. ...... Nc6 - in response to the pawn stab my horse defends the d4 pawn.} 30. f5 Rd6 {30. ..... Rd6 - As my horsie and Glenda are defending the d5 pawn my rook decides to go to Henry's aid.  Only the g7 pawn comes between Henry and the Witch.} 31. fxg6+ Rxg6 32. Qh5 {32. Qxh5 - pin.} Qxa2 {32. ....... Qxa2 - I decide that Glenda can safely whip off the a2 pawn restoring material equality.  However, this gives my opponent the opportunity of a perpetual.  Starting ......} 33. Qf5+ Rf6 {33. .... Rf6 - my rook gallantly shields Henry but that Witch can attack him from the side.  Henry goes back to g6 and I decide that I do not think Henry can escape the checks from the Witch, so I bite the bullet and hold out the olive branch.} 34. Qd7+ Kg6 {}
