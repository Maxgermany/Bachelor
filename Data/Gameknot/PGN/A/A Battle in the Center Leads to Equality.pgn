1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {Entering the Grunfeld Defense. More suiting my style of late is 3.Nf3, making sure Black gets in the King's Indian Defense. } 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 {Bg7 is more common, but this is an active response that works well.} 7. Nf3 {Bc4 is just as good, but I take after the old masters who said to develop the knights before bishops :)} Bg7 8. Be3 {I like this direct response, but Rb1 is most played.} Qa5 {Usually you don't want to bring out your queen this early on and this far, but it has a strong purpose on a5. } 9. Qd2 Nc6 10. Rc1 cxd4 11. cxd4 {I have a pawn majority in the center but it is under attack at the moment. I also have a semi-open file that I need to find out how I can put it to use. } Qxd2+ 12. Kxd2 {Without queens on the board and the lack of black's development, I don't have to worry so much about attacks against my king. } O-O 13. d5 {Opening a line for my bishop and gaining more space. } Rd8 14. Ke1 Na5 {Nb4 leaves a strong possibility of the knight being trapped.} 15. Bg5 {Restricting counterplay from black. } Bd7 16. Bd3 f5 {A key moment in the game: advance my pawns and possibly overextend, or ease into the crux of black's counterplay. Bxe7 is met simply with Re8 and a fork comes on e4. } 17. e5 {I decide to have faith in my pawns.} Be8 18. d6 Rdc8 19. dxe7 {I've won a pawn, but can I hold on to it?} h6 20. Bd2 Rxc1+ 21. Bxc1 Rc8 22. Be3 Nc4 {A key move from black the creates the draw. Bd4 and black will slowly win the pawns on e7 and e5 with the advance of the king.  } 23. Bxa7 Nxe5 24. Nxe5 Bxe5 25. Ke2 {I offered a draw based on us both having dark/light square bishops and equal material without any sight of an endgame advantage for each side. The pawn on e7 falls in no time after Kf7 and Rc7. A solid game from both players. Black seemed to play with more purpose, but came up short on an advantage.  }
