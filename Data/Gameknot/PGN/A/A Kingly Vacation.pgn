1. e4 c5 {Team match, I'm playing black, and opt for the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {All by the book. 5. ... a6 is the Najdorf Variation, the most popular line in the Sicilian. The move prepares 6. ... e5. If black plays 5. ... e5 then white replies 6. Bb5+ which causes weaknesses in black's position. Hence, 5. ... a6 prevents that, as well as keeping the two white knights away from b5.} 6. Be2 e5 {6. Be2 is a little timid, much quieter than 6. Be3 or 6. Bg5. Black just follows the main premise of the Najdorf, playing 6. ... e5 without fear of the 7. Bb5 reprisal.} 7. Nb3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Be3 Be6 {By the book.} 10. f4 exf4 {White commits to some fireworks in the center and now both sides have an isolated center pawn.} 11. Bxf4 Nc6 12. Nd4 Qb6 13. Be3 Nxd4 {White threatened a discovered attack by his bishop at e3 against the black queen at b6.} 14. Bxd4 Qc7 15. Bd3 Qa5 {I played this move nearly a month ago and right now I am not sure why. It puts two attackers on the white pawn at a2, but he has two defenders and can easily be pushed forward to a3. From a5 the black queen can quickly reach the kingside. She covers e5, but she did that from c7 as well. It opens the half-open c-file for a rook, but there is little for that rook to do. I think the main thing that motivated this move was fear of white playing Nd5 which would fork the black queen on c7 and black knight on f6 and almost force black to reply with Nxd5 allowing white to play exd5 freeing him from an isolated pawn. White only needs one more piece to make it work, such as with Qf3.} 16. a3 Rac8 17. Qf3 Bd8 {To move to the queenside.} 18. Qg3 Bb6 {Threatening the white bishop on d4 and pinning it to the white king. Black's pawn at d6 is undefended but black will lose material if he takes it. 19. Qxd6? is met with 19. ... Rc6! and now black's queen has nowhere to run that still defends the white bishop on d4. Not 20. Qe5?? because that bishop on d4 is pinned, so it cannot recapture after black plays 20. ... Qxe5. And counterattacking with 20. Bxb6?? fails to 20. ... Qxb6+, giving check which gives time for 21. ... Rxd6 and white loses his queen.} 19. Qf2 Bxd4 {White was threatening 20. Bxf6 gxf6 21. Qxf6 gaining a pawn and a strong kingside attack. The bishop exchange puts an end to this threat.} 20. Qxd4 Ng4 21. Rf3 Ne5 {Forking rook and bishop.} 22. Rg3 Kh8 {The black knight at e5 is pinned; if it moves then white plays Qxg7#. The pawn at g2 is only defended by the black king. If white gets a second attacker on g7, bad things will happen. 22. ... Kh8 opens the space at g8 for a rook to assist with the defense of g7. Meanwhile, the isolated pawn on d6 is still undefended and en prise.} 23. Qxd6 Rfd8 {This move, 23. Qxd6?, gets a ? for removing a defender of the knight at f3 which lets black win material. Now the black queen wants to fork then fork again, but white's queen is in the way. I think during the game I had a plan to handle 24. Qb4, but now looking at it, I have no idea what that plan was, and this looks like white's saving move here. Maybe I'll re-analyze it later, but right now, I think I'm glad white didn't find this move.} 24. Qe7 Qb6+ {There we go. Fork number 1, king and pawn.} 25. Kf1 Qxb2 {Fork number 2, the winning fork. The rook on a1 and knight on c3 are both en prise, and white can only save one of them.} 26. Rb1 Qxc3 27. Qg5 Nxd3 {27. Qg5 threatens mate in 1 with Qxg7#. Black needs to defend, so why not defend with an attack that wins more material?} 28. cxd3 Rxd3 {Black has gained a pawn and now threatens to exchange more material.} 29. Re1 Rxg3 30. hxg3 Bc4+ {Now white's in trouble. The king cannot run to the corner, or black plays 31. ... Qxe1. So 31. Kf2 is forced, and it begins a little sightseeing vacation for the white king.} 31. Kf2 Qd4+ {Black is looking for angles to trade queens. This would leave him with a bishop+pawn material advantage, and white's pawn structure in total disarray.  If white blocks with his queen, 32. Qe3 Qxe3 and black trades queens and gains an easy endgame. If white blocks with his rook, 32. Re3 Qd2+ 33. Kf3 Be2+ 34. Kf4 Rc3 wins the white rook. } 32. Kf3 Rc6 {32. Rc6! seals black's doom. The threat is that black can move the rook around the 6th rank, checking the white king and eventually pinning the queen to the king and winning white's queen. Black doesn't have any way out. If he runs, with 33. Qc1, then 33. ... Rf6+ 34. Kg4 Be6+ 35. Kh4 Rh6+ wins white's queen by forcing 36. Qxh6 (36. Kg5 Qe5#). White could try to make a bolt-hole with 33. g4 , but 33. ... Rf6+ 34. Kg3 Qe5+ 35. Kh4 Rh6+ wins white's queen for a rook. Black entered the conditional moves from this point until the capture of the white queen or to checkmate, depending on white's choices.   } 33. Qe3 Rf6+ {White tried to offer the queen exchange, but black isn't interested. Why trade queen for queen when you can trade rook for queen instead?} 34. Kg4 Be6+ 35. Kh4 Rh6+ {And now white must play 36. Qxh6 to avoid mate.} 36. Kg5 Qe5# {Final position.}
