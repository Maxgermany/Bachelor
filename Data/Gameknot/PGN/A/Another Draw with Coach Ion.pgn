1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This is my return game with Coach Ion as black in the King's Indian 4 Pawns Attack.  In this game I achieved only my second High Draw against him.  Between the two draws I have had some really bad games, including the King's Indian 4 Pawns Attack as White in which I blundered a piece after walking into a pin and never recovered.  Also, that game Pipped at the Post was only a pretence of a contest, although Ion got his checkmate in first I was never really in that game.  Then there was this shocker - I think Be6 was the loser - I followed the database and I think that that move should be given the skull and crossbones http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13392792&fb=1&rnd=0.7322375019235583 - do you the Jury agree on that one?  Anyhow, I will take you to move 6 in this game ......} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f4 O-O 6. Nf3 c5 {6. ...... c5 - a first attempt at breaching the wall after some standard King's Indian 4 Pawn Attack moves.} 7. d5 e6 {7. ...... e6 - attempt No.2.} 8. Be2 exd5 9. cxd5 {9. cxd5 - pawn trade.} Bg4 10. e5 Bxf3 11. Bxf3 dxe5 12. fxe5 {12. fxe5 - now only 2 pawns are left after the breach in the wall.} Nfd7 13. e6 Ne5 {13. ..... Ne5 - handy how my horsie can jump on a good square where he does not have to worry about pawn molestation!} 14. exf7+ Rxf7 {14. ...... Rxf7 - another pawn trade - only 1 pawn standing but, ssss, it is a passer!} 15. O-O Nbd7 {15. .... Nbd7 - out comes my other knight, to support my king knight and to clear the decks on that back row!} 16. Kh1 Nxf3 17. Rxf3 Rxf3 18. Qxf3 Qf8 {18. ...... Qf8 - a lot has been going on over the last few moves, one pair of minor pieces has been traded and I now offer a queen trade.  Ion chooses to put his bishop in the way.} 19. Bf4 Qf5 {19. ..... Qf5 - puts Glenda in a more active spot with ideas of Qc2.  I also have Rf8 in mind but I got impatient and played Be5 first.  Maybe I should have played Rf8 and traded off all the major pieces, after all, Henry is closer to that d5 pawn that Ion's king.} 20. Rf1 Be5 21. Bxe5 Qxf3 22. Rxf3 {22. Rxf3 - the queens have been traded off and now I must take Ion's bishop to avoid remaining a piece down.} Nxe5 23. Re3 Rf8 {23. ..... Rf8 - the knight on e5 is temporarily protected by the rook on f8.  Ion is more than welcome to take the knight because if he does he will lose his king!} 24. Kg1 {24. Kg1 - naturally evading Old Matey's shadow by moving his king towards the centre now that we are in an endgame.} Nd7 {24. ...... Nd7 - here this steed remains for the rest of the game.  I bet you are all  wondering, how on earth do I avoid losing this one when I am playing effectively a piece down against such a strong Expert?} 25. d6 {25. d6 - that passer advances, only my steed stands between the pawn on d6 and promotion.  Thankfully that is as far as that pawn ever gets.  I did think Ion would play Re7 but then I can play Rf7 because Henry can recapture towards the passed pawn and if I get checked on the back rank back goes my rook.} Rf6 26. Re8+ Rf8 27. Re2 {27. Re2 - Ion eschews the trade because he does not want Henry to consume a p(r)awn cracker for his supper (that p(r)awn on d6 is particularly juicy - truly fit for a king!)} Rf6 28. Rd2 Re6 29. Kf2 a6 {29. ..... a6 - I do not wish Ion's horsie to hop onto b5.} 30. Kf3 Re5 {30. ..... Re5 - keeping my rook as active as I can.} 31. Ne4 Rf5+ 32. Ke3 h5 {32. ...... h5 - trying to hold back g4.} 33. h3 b6 34. Rd1 Kg7 {34. ...... Kg7 - now Henry must enter the fray!} 35. g4 hxg4 36. hxg4 Rf7 {36. ..... Rf7 - my rook retreats to a safe square.} 37. Ng5 {37. Ng5 - I anticipated this move but never mind my rook can go to f6 and if Ion puts his knight back on e4 then I can always put my rook back on f7 and do this dance again!} Rf6 38. b3 Kh6 {38. ..... Kh6 - Henry bravely steps onto the h column to put the question to Ion's horsie which shies off to e4.} 39. Ne4 Rf8 {39. ..... Rf8 - rather a passive square but I am thinking about protecting the back row just in case my knight is compelled to move away from d7.} 40. Rd5 Re8 {40. ...... Re8 - Ion's last rook move to d5 has permitted my own rook to move off the f file for now thanks to my pawn on g6.  I now decide to pin that pesky knight.} 41. g5+ Kg7 42. Rd2 Rf8 {42. ...... Rf8 - back goes my rook onto the f column to avoid letting Ion take control of the f column.  Should Ion put his rook on the h column, my rook is also gonna go there.} 43. Nc3 {43. Nc3 - a retreat, does Ion have something up his sleeve?} Rf5 {43. ..... Rf5 - my rook assumes a relatively active position and attacks Ion's isolani on g5.  It feels good when I can combine attack with defense.} 44. Rd5 {44. Rd5! - Ion knows just how much I lurve exchanges.  Luckily I smell a rat.  If Rxd5 then 45. Nxd5 Kf7, 46. Kd5 Ke6 and now 47. Nf4+.  Either Henry must defend the pawn on g6 allowing Ion's king to make a decisive penetration on my queenside or I must take the d6 pawn and allow a passer on the g column.  Either way I will be letting Ion's king become a bull in a china shop on my queenside.  So, I play the seemingly passive Rf8 and hold out the olive branch.  I half expected a refusal given the rating differential and the fact that I have played badly against him in the matches between the two draws against him.  Ion did not refuse and so at least I only had to wait five matches before getting my second draw against him - the first one took 14 games to achieve so maybe some encouraging signs are just around the corner as I strive to regain my Class A status.  Well, I will worry about that later and toast the here and the now!} Rf8 {44. ..... Rf8 - Ion, you played really well and you did nothing wrong.  I think, though, that I have been threatening to do this to you and Master Freddy for a long, long time but not quite succeeded.  Thankfully I allowed no silly tactics in this game and so I gave you nothing and you had to settle for a Low Draw.  Better luck next time - Joanne.  }
