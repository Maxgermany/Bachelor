[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Here I'm playing white on a Philidor defense.} 3. d4 Bg4 {? Bad move, forcing the lost of a pawn or the Bishop. Black entering into a risky game.} 4. dxe5 {If Black does 4.dxe5 then 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Nxe5 and black lose a pawn. Blackburne played a gambit on this variation with good results: 4.Nc6 5.exd6 Bxd6. Giving him some tempo for a lost of the pawn. } Bxf3 {Black chose to lose his Bishop. Bishops are better than knight in most of the end games that's why Larsker said to play knights before to play bishops.} 5. Qxf3 dxe5 6. Bc4 {Well right now I play the same opening that Morphy used in his well-known Opera game. The position of white is pretty nice, threatening Qf7, and is better developed than black. } Qe7 {I think the best position for black is Qf6, asking for an exchange of queens. The queen is bad placed here because he blocks the way of his bishop; black will have to lose tempo if he wants to castle on the king side or develop his rook. It's quite obvious now that black gonna try to castle on his queen side.} 7. O-O {Well here I had a lot of choice. I didn't want to go to Qb3 because white could have done Qb4+ and forcing the trade of queens. Nc3 would have been fine but it would have blocked the way for my queen if I wanted to attack on the queen side. Bg5 would have been too slow, I think. My main concern right now was to block the castling of white on the queen side, that's why I have castled right now. If black does Nc6 instead of Nd7, I would get a great advantage.} Nf6 8. Bg5 {Pinning the knight and forcing the queen to stay at e7.} Nbd7 {! Well done. Now my rook can't take possession of the d line.} 9. Qb3 {If black castle, then I can take the f pawn. Now my queen gonna be ready to enter in the battlefield.  Computer analysis: Best: +1.58 » 9. Nc3 O-O-O 10. Rfd1 h6 11. Be3 Qb4 12. Qe2 Kb8 13. a3 Qe7 14. b4 Qe8 15. Nb5 c5 16. Bd3 } b6 {This move was almost forced if Black doesn't wanted to lose a pawn or the d line.} 10. Nc3 {Now my position is pretty nice! } a6 {?? Huge lost of tempo. Black was probably thinking about to do b5 after that.} 11. Rfd1 {?! I don't remember why I have done this move loll. I think it was to have a more accurate attack and to force the queen to not go on the d line.  Computer analysis:Mistake: +1.84 » 11. Rfd1 c6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Na4 Rb8 14. Qh3 Nc5 15. Nxb6 Bd6 16.

Bxf8 Nxf8 } Rd8 {Not sure if it was the best move here.} 12. Nd5 {Now I'm ready to enter the battlefield! Threatening both the queen and c7.} Nc5 {! Best move to do! If 12.Qc5 then 13.Nc7+ Qxc7 14.Bf7+ Ke7 15.Qe6#.} 13. Bb5+ {!! Qf3 and Qh3 could have been fine, but it would have given the option to black to do Rxd5. My goal was to take the queen or the king! If black take the Bishop in his next move, it will mean the lost of his queen. The sac is sound if white play accurately.} axb5 {The best defense here was 13.Rd7! then 14.Bxf6!, entering into wild variations, with advantage to white. - Ex1:14.Bxf6 Nxb3 15.Nxc7+ Kd8 16.Bxe7+ Bxe7 17.Rxd7+ Kc8 18.axb3 axb5 19.Rxe7 Kd8 20.Rxf7 then Ra8#  - Ex2:14.Bxf6 axb5 15.Qa3!

Rd1 {Thinking to do b4 on next move.} Rg6 19. Bxe5 {If 19.b4 Rxf6 20.bxc5 c6 21.Qe2 and black have a better position. 19.Rxd7 Nxd7 lead to nothing.} c6 {! Well done. The queen must retreat.} 20. Qe2 Bd6 {Not sure if it was the best move here but anyway, I don't see how black find a win in this situation.} 21. Bxd6 Rgxd6 22. Rxd6 {No choice to take.} Rxd6 23. e5 {! Getting out of the reach of the knight and advancing.} Rd7 {Maybe Re6 would have been more accurate, but the rook would have lost some mobility.} 24. f4 Ne6 25. g3 c5 26. c3 {Now I've got a nice pawn structure. Moved to c3 to protect it from the rook and to avoid Nd4.} Ke7 {Thinking to do f6.} 27. Qb5 {27.Rd1+ 28.Kg2 Rd2+ 29Kh3 would have only helped me to win faster! } f6 {? Bad move. Black can't take it back because I will take his rook.} 28. exf6+ Kd8 {? Bad move again. Ke8 was the only good solution.} 29. Qxb6+ {Black have now the choice to lose his knight or to be mated.} Nc7 30. Qb8# {He decide to be mated! :P Well it was a nice game.}
