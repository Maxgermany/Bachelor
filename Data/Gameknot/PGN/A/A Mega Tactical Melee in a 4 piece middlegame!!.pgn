[Opening "Dutch with c4 & Nc3 (A85)"]

1. d4 f5 {1. .......... f5 - the Dutch Defense, hits out at the centre and controls e4.  This move is playable but do watch that Fool's Mate diagonal.} 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 d6 4. Nf3 g6 5. Bf4 Bg7 {5. .......... Bg7 - black continues to develop on the flank.  I am now ready to castle kingside and I do so next move.} 6. g3 O-O 7. Bg2 c6 {7. .......... c6 - white also develops on the flank and castles next move, the purpose of this move is to try and negate the white lsb's path to a8 and perhaps prepare d5.} 8. O-O Qe8 9. Re1 Nh5 10. Bd2 e5 11. dxe5 dxe5 12. e4 f4 {12. ......... f4 - my opponent and I have been following the main line of the database, but we go into unchartered waters next move when my opponent plays his queen to b3.} 13. Qb3 Nd7 14. c5+ Qf7 15. Qxf7+ Rxf7 {15. .......... In response to the queen move to d3 I bring out my knight to d7.  This knight will move to f8 to make room for my lsb to come out as I am lagging behind a bit in development.  This allows a discovered check but all that happens is that the queens get swapped off.} 16. b4 {16. b4 - backs up his c pawn.} Re7 17. Rad1 Nf8 18. Na4 Be6 19. Nc3 {19. Nc3 - knight had to backtrack because of the black lsb's threat to the white pawn on a2.} Rd8 20. Bc1 Rxd1 21. Rxd1 Rd7 22. Rd6 {22. Rd6?  - White overreaches himself here with this move.  An aggressive placement for the rook but this will lead to white losing a pawn.} Rxd6 23. cxd6 Nd7 {23. ......... Nd7 - first the passer is blockaded.} 24. a4 Bf8 25. Nd1 Bxd6 {25 ........ Bxd6 - and is now rounded up and eaten up!} 26. Bd2 h6 {26. ....... h6 - I have a very weak pawn on e4 which is backward and under a bit of strain, so is the f pawn, so reinforcements are being brought up.  Over the next few moves a plan to liquidate the weak e and f pawns brews up and ebervesces into an astounding tactical melee!} 27. Nb2 {27. Nb2 - threatens to win the e pawn but as in my previous note I have other ideas.} g5 28. Nd3 Nhf6 {28. ......... Nhf6!! - attacks the white pawn on e4 - hopefully I will be able to exchange it for my own e pawn.  I do and get a lot more than what I bargained for.  Are you ready ............} 29. Bc3 Nxe4 {29. ............ Nxe4 ............. here it comes!!!} 30. Bxe5 fxg3 {30. ............. fxg3 - first a little zwizchenzug!} 31. Bxd6 gxf2+ 32. Nxf2 Nxd6 33. Nd4 Kf7 {33.  ....... Kf7 - there, I hope you have managed to keep up with that special plethora of exchanges.  Now the black king emerges to take part in the endgame, which is going to be a long one!} 34. Bf3 Ne5 35. Bh5+ Ke7 36. Kf1 Bc4+ 37. Kg2 Kf6 38. Kg3 Nf5+ {38. ........ Nf5  I now succeed in removing more wood from the board without compromising my pawn structure.} 39. Nxf5 Kxf5 40. Bd1 Kf6 41. Ne4+ Ke7 42. Kf2 {42. Kf2? - loses yet another pawn to a knight fork.} Nd3+ 43. Kf3 Nxb4 44. Kg4 Bf7 45. Kf5 Nd5 46. Bf3 {46. Bf3 - this allows the exchange of another pair of pieces without compromising my pawn structure.} Ne3+ 47. Ke5 Bd5 48. Kd4 Bxe4 49. Bxe4 Ng4 50. h3 Nf6 51. Bf3 {51. Bf3 - keeping one set of minor pieces on the board - if you are a pawn down or more in a king and pawn endgame it is a lost endgame (assuming no doubletons or isolanis)} Kd6 {51. ......... Kd6!! - now we get another tactic, the knight and the king are both on dark squares, white has a lsb.  This king move keeps out the white king.  I call this tactic the Joblock - it is very effective here.} 52. Kc4 b5+ 53. axb5 cxb5+ 54. Kxb5 Ke5 {54. .......... Ke5 - over the last few moves I decided to liquidate my queenside pawns to get my king over to the kingside and try and crown one or both of my kingside pawns.  It will be the g pawn that will spell checkmate for my opponent.  My a pawn is a handy decoy for the white king, forcing him to waste 2 vital tempi in capturing the pawn.  Thankfully this decision paid off.} 55. Ka6 Kf4 56. Bb7 Kg3 57. Bc8 {57. Bc8 - defends the h pawn but the knight will soon round it up and eat it up.} Nh5 58. Kxa7 Nf4 59. Kb6 Nxh3 60. Kc5 {60 . Kc5 - the white king is approaching fast?  Will he get to g1 on time?  I now guard the queening square with Nf2 which will force white to give up his bishop.  Notice that I cannot lose this game with the fall of the h pawn whatever happens now.} Nf2 61. Kd4 h5 62. Ke3 h4 63. Ke2 h3 64. Kf1 h2 {64. ........ h2 - prevents the wk from reaching g1.} 65. Bb7 h1=Q+ 66. Bxh1 Nxh1 67. Kg1 Nf2 {67. ........... Nf2 - the knight moves and forces Kf1 - it is white's only legal move.  Must be careful, must not allow the wrong kind of mate!} 68. Kf1 Kh2 {68. ....... Kh2 - my king feels bad about giving up his beloved steed, but soon he is about to get a new wife (not sure it is a good thing - marriages were not always made in heaven in medieval times!!).  It was midnight on Sunday 18 May 2008.  I set my alarm clock for 645 am BST and at the same time set up 69 ......... g4 as a conditional move, just in case white takes the knight.} 69. Kxf2 g4 70. Kf1 {70. Kf1 then resigns - my alarm clock goes off, I log in at about 645 BST on Monday morning.  I am greeted by a white flag from my opponent as he cannot stop the g pawn from crowning and then proceeding to play a deadly game of kiss chase with the white king!   Wheeew, what a relief!!}
