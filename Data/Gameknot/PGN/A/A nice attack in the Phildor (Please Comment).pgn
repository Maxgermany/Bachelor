1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {This is the Phildor Defense} 3. d4 {Staking my claim in the center, easily the best continuation} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {Defending the pawn, as well as developing} Be7 6. Bc4 O-O 7. O-O {This is all standard theory I  believe, maybe Nc6 before Be7. } c5 {!? This isn't really recommended in the Phildor, as black's DSB becomes infinitely worse, as well as making a potential hole on d5. } 8. Nf5 {!? Usually I play Nf3, but I was feeling in an adventurous mood. I like this move because is places the knight close to the king in case of a potential attack, and if black chooses to exchange, it gets rid of their bishop pair and puts a nice attacking pawn on f5.} Bxf5 9. exf5 Nc6 10. g4 {At this point, it was all or nothing. I was really interested to see if this plan of mine would work.} Re8 {? Best here was probably h6, as this allowed g5.} 11. g5 {Continuing with my plan} Nd7 12. Qh5 {! Bringing more pieces into the attack, and creating a multitude of threats, the most obvious being Bxf7+} Rf8 {? Better was probably either Nce5 or Nde5. Both those moves bring another defender to black's king.} 13. f6 {! Black is completely lost here.} gxf6 {?? Much better was Bxf6, but my materialistic opponent missed the nice combination that comes next} 14. g6 {! And black's position is resignable. The computer actually gives a better continuation for white, which is a mate in 5 starting with 14. Bd3 f5 15. Bxf5 Nf6 16. gxf6 Re8 17. Qxh7+ Kf8 18. Qg7#} hxg6 15. Qxg6+ Kh8 16. Qh6+ Kg8 17. Kh1 {An important move, allowing my rook to access the G-file. Bd3 is also possible here I think} f5 {Allowing his bishop to come to g5} 18. Rg1+ Bg5 19. Bxg5 {Here my opponent graciously allowed me to mate.} Qc8 20. Bd8# {This move was a bit cheeky to mate, since any bishop move mates. Thanks for looking at the game, I hope you enjoyed it!}
