[Opening "Queen's pawn game (E00)"]

1. d4 {I open with my usual d4. I use the queen's gambit and find it to be a very powerful opening.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Bf4 {I like to get my dark squared bishop out early so that its not blocked in when I play e3.} Bb4+ 4. Nc3 Ne4 {He was playing awfully aggressive for black, especially considering his passive pawn structure. He is already able to castle, but if he were to trade off pieces he would fall way behind in development.} 5. Qd3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 {Having to capture with the pawn meant that I would not be able to castle for a while, but it does not appear that I am in any immediate danger.} Nd6 7. Nf3 O-O 8. Ng5 {He castled early with most of his pieces still undeveloped. I jumped at the chance for a quick kingside attack.} f5 9. d5 {I was hoping that if I broke up the centre, the presence of my pieces would pose a threat to the vunerable king.} Ne4 10. Nxe4 fxe4 11. Qxe4 exd5 12. Qxd5+ Kh8 13. e3 {The centre is broken but it leaves them a chance to chase my queen to regain some tempo and catch up in development.} c6 14. Qe4 d5 15. cxd5 cxd5 16. Qf3 Bf5 17. Rd1 Be4 18. Qg4 Nc6 19. Bd3 {Hoping to centralize my rook and I'm finally able to castle.} Bxd3 20. Rxd3 Qa5 21. O-O Qxa2 {My defence was strong so the rouge queen did not threaten me, but if I were to start an attack of my own I would need to do something about the powerful black knight.  The pawns and bishop are unable to attack him and I was not planning on trading a rook or queen so my target had to be the pawn on b7.} 22. Qd7 d4 23. Qxb7 Qc4 24. Rfd1 {Here is where the game gets interesting. with so much tension in the centre pawns and both kings in vulnerable positions, a swift attack could break out at any minute.} Rab8 {Careless..} 25. Bxb8 Rxb8 26. Qc7 {A very good square for my queen, virtually paralyzing all of blacks pieces.} h6 {Now that checkmate became much more difficult, my next target would be the pinned knight.} 27. Rd3xd4 Qxc3 28. Rd4d6 Rb6 {What would you play as white in this position? I played as aggressive as possible so that I could stay in control of the game.} 29. Rxh6+ {Rh6?! Sacrificing one rook..} gxh6 30. Rd8+ {.. and a second rook..} Nxd8 31. Qxc3+ {.. in exchange for the queen. It is important that the opponent is in check in this position or else Rb1 would have led to checkmate.} Kh7 32. f4 Rb7 33. Qd3+ {Black moves to defend Qc7 but fails to see the second possible fork between the king and knight. Black promptly resigns.}
