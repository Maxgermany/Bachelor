[Opening "Sicilian (B32), Labourdonnais-Loewenthal (Kalashnikov) variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {Standard Sicilian so far.} e5 {e5, we move into the Labourdonnais-Loewenthal variation... cool name for sure!} 5. Nb5 {and this move adds (Kalashnikov) to the variation name... I wonder what the longest variation name in Chess Database of openings is.  Anyone know?} Nf6 {Nf6, attack my king pawn, naturally.} 6. Nb1c3 {Nb1c3, and I have an awkward position to say the least.} Bb4 {Bb4, logical move, pin my knight.} 7. a3 Ba5 {This was an interesting play.  I think Bxc3 might have been better, but let's see how it plays out.} 8. Nd6+ {Nd6 , this was simply played to prevent black from castling.} Ke7 9. Be3 {My dark square bishop is eyeing c5...} Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Ne8 {Black has to boot my Knight out, but I'm looking at two good diagonals for my bishops on c4 and c5} 11. Bc5 Nxd6 12. Bxd6+ {One bishop attacking...} Ke8 13. Bc4 {...two bishops attacking...} Qa5 {Qa5, a nice threat, but this move takes Blacks queen away from the main action of my attack and doesn't offer enough of a counter attack.  I think better was b5.} 14. Qd2 {I looked at Qf3 also, but for some reason chose this instead.  I don't know why anymore, can anyone else tell me?} h5 {Black now is showing his intentions of getting his king side rook involved, maybe this is why I didn't move Qf3 on the previous move... } 15. O-O Rh6 {as expected} 16. f4 {This was the key move for me.  It exposes my king to an easy check, but that's what I want.  Then Black can move his knight to a5 and double attack my bishops, but he didn't look any further than that...} Qb6+ {Just as I had hoped...} 17. Kh1 Na5 {... and the trap is set.  Black is thinking he is going to end up with a bishop advantage, but I had sacrifice planned from the time f4 was played.} 18. Bxf7+ {and it begins} Kxf7 19. fxe5+ {my pawns also provide a nice barrier to seal off Black's Queen from coming to the defense.} Kg6 {Only play to avoind mate or tremendous loss of material} 20. Qf4 {threatening mate still} Kh7 {again only move to fight of mate} 21. Qf5+ {time to chip away at Black's weakened king side defenses and maintain heavy pressure... notice also how Black's light square bishop is locked in and consequently keeps his other Rook locked in.} Rg6 {yeah, free pawn!} 22. Qxh5+ Rh6 23. Qf5+ Rg6 {hoping for a draw perhaps} 24. Rf4 {Rf4?, a nearly complete blunder... Rf3 was the play.} Qd8 {See, if I had played Rf3, then this move would not have mattered.} 25. Rf3 {Now I played Rf3, and fortunately it didn't affect the outcome, but it could've been over sooner than it did.} Qg5 26. Rh3+ {Bye-bye queen!} Kg8 {Kg8????, a total blunder, but like I stated earlier it should have been over by move 26 anyway!} 27. Qf8# {and mate!  }
