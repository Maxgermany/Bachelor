1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 d5 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. Nbd2 c5 7. e3 Nc6 8. c3 c4 {the pawn push temporarily gains black additional space.} 9. Re1 b5 10. a3 a5 11. h3 Bb7 12. e4 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 dxe4 14. Rxe4 Nb4 {white cannot play 15.PxN since his R would then be lost to black's wB found on b7 after the discovered attack.} 15. Re2 Nd3 {black plants his N firmly in white's backfield.} 16. Ne5 Bxg2 {black initiates the trade to remove his challenged and unprotected wB.} 17. Kxg2 Nxe5 18. Rxe5 Qd7 19. Bd2 f6 20. Re1 Qd5+ 21. Qf3 Qxf3+ 22. Kxf3 {with both Qs off the board, the question becomes - who can promote a pawn first!} Kf7 23. Re2 Ra6 24. Rae1 h6 25. h4 Re8 26. Bf4 Bd6 27. Bxd6 Rxd6 28. Kg4 g6 29. f4 h5+ 30. Kf3 f5 31. Re2e5 Rd5 32. Re1e2 Re7 33. Kf2 Kf6 34. Ke1 a4 {from this position black cannot move his K or e7-R away from the current files, or else white breaks through with the R battery. black's d5-R is trapped on its current rank, or else white picks off the b-pawn.    white, meanwhile, could have continued to scoot his K over to Q-side of the board, playing b3, forcing a trade and forcing a win.   instead, white chose to accept black's draw offer.}
