1. e4 {I am endeavoring to improve in chess and therefore, I have decided to annotate some of my losses.  I have been trying to focus more on tactics in my limited study time and avoided studying openings.  I have good self-esteem--feel free to point out my multitude of errors.} d6 {I'm going with the Pirc defense.  It seemed simple enough but I'm slowly learning that it is a defense that is somewhat more complicated.} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 {Standard development, in my estimation, thus far.} 5. Be2 O-O 6. O-O c6 {Here is where I was unsure of what I should do (see, I really haven't been studying openings).  My thought was c6 would help contest the middle while at the same time prevent N3 from landing on b3.} 7. Be3 Nbd7 {I needed to develop my N and d2 seemed like a reasonable square.} 8. Qd2 {In hindsight, I should have paid much more attention to the attack forming in the center.} b5 {But I blissfully decide to create space on the Queen side, happily unaware of what is about to take place.} 9. a3 {Well, guess I'm not threatening the Nc3 after all.} Bb7 {I didn't know what to do so I did the fianchetto with my Bishop.} 10. Bh6 {I didn't like that move very much but I didn't want to waste any tempo (or is it tempi) on taking the Bishop.} e5 11. Bxg7 Kxg7 12. Rfd1 a6 {I wish I could describe my thought process behind a6.  Perhaps in the darkest recesses in my psyche, I wanted to lose.} 13. dxe5 dxe5 {Bad things are about to happen.} 14. Qd6 Nb6 {I thought to trade Queens to alleviate the threat.  No such luck.  } 15. Qxe5 Qb8 16. Rd6 {It only gets worse from here on out.} Kg8 17. Qxf6 Qc7 18. Ne5 Rae8 19. Ng4 h5 20. Nh6+ Kh7 21. Nf5 gxf5 22. Qxf5+ Kg8 23. Qg5+ {}
