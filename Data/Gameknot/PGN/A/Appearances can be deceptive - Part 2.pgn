1. c3 {Hi everyone!  If you have read about my unnecessary concession of a Low Draw against my Class D buddy The Dentist due to some optical illusions then spare a thought for my former Class B opponent dmaestro.  In this game, Glenda scared him into waving the white flag with her imposing presence on the h column.   At least I only gave away half a point - at least dmaestro also has the consolation of the game being unrated however.   But gameknot analysis will show that he did have a defense to my mating attack.  Here is the link to the Gameknot Analysis version:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14125809&rnd=0.0035182255284116892.  Anyway, on with the game in which I decided to experiment with the Sargossa opening which is 1. c3.} Nf6 2. Nf3 {2. Nf3 - out come the horsies!} g6 3. d4 Bg7 4. Bg5 {4. Bg5 - an unusual early emergence of Fou Lenoir - he is usually one of the last to get out of the starting blocks in a jstevens1 game!} O-O 5. Nbd2 h6 6. Bxf6 Bxf6 {6. ........ Bxf6 - B for N trade.} 7. e4 {7. e4 - trying to expand in the centre while I can and rid myself of the passivitis demon that has dogged my mid-game play!  Although I have not yet castled black still needs to develop his queenside.} d6 8. Bc4 e5 9. dxe5 dxe5 {9. ....... dxe5 - pawn trade.} 10. Qe2 {10. Qe2 - Glenda clears the way so that I can keep my options open as to what to do with Henry.  As it so happens, he stays put!} c6 11. h4 {11. h4 - here I try and emulate the Master Mater with a push down the h column.  However, Fou Leblanc now finds himself having to dodge a black footman or two on the queenside.} b5 12. Bb3 a5 13. a3 {13. a3 - trying to keep my options open as to where to put Fou Leblanc.} Nd7 14. g4 {14. g4? - this move should have cost me a pawn but dmaestro appears to have overlooked the hanging pawn and decided to attack Fou Leblanc instead.} Nc5 15. Bc2 {15. Bc2?! - here Gameknot stated my move was an innacuracy and suggested g5 - please see the link for further detail.  Dmaestro now notices my hanging pawn and it really looks as if I have dropped a pawn but for .......} Bxg4 {15. ...... Bxg4 - here dmaestro stated in his resignation note that he thought that Ne6 was better here, do you the Inquest Jury agree?} 16. Qe3 {16. Qe3! ...... GLENDA! - Sometimes, passive though she can be, she is learning to be very sneaky, can you guys spot a queen fork here?  If so, what is she forking?} Ne6 17. Qxh6 Nf4 18. Ng5 {18. Ng5 - here dmaestro waves the white flag.  Do you think that Glenda looks like a defender here? If you look at Gameknot Analysis black still has a clear edge over me, so I have won a lost position - isn't Jo a lucky so and so!  Do you the jury agree?}
