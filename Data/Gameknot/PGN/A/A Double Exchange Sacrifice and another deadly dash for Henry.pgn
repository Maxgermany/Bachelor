1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I decided to take part in Concordborn's MT because I would be playing against players within 200 rating points of my own rating.  In this game I was matched up against a Class B player.  This is a themed MT which explores a certain branch of the Sicilian Defense.  I get into a good position in the middlegame only to be floored by a double exchange sacrifice.  Henry is then subjected to a Deadly Dash from the Wicked Witch of the West and is driven to the h column where he does manage to stay out of Old Matey's shadow.  Unfortunately Henry could not dodge Ye Olde Perpetualle and I had to concede a Low Draw.  How did this happen?  Where here is the Gameknot Analysis.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17374759&rnd=0.411434717519163} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 {6.  Ndb5 - this is where the forced moves end and the MT starts.  A knight comes to b5 and would like to plant itself on d6 should black's dsb move off the f8-a3 diagonal.  The knight also puts pressure on c7 threatening a standard K and R fork.} d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 {8. Na3 - this knight is forced back but there is the possiblity of it relocating to c4 later on.} Be7 9. Nc4 b5 10. Bxf6 gxf6 {10. .... gxf6 - the white knight does go to c4 where it is targeted by the b5 pawn.  Rather than move the knight away immediately a B for N trade appears on the kingside.  This is in the World DB - I still cannot resist exchanging a B for N to break up an opponent's pawn structure!} 11. Ne3 Bb7 12. Nf5 {12. Nf5 - a good outpost for my king knight.} Na7 13. Nd5 {13. Nd5 - another knight finds an outpost but this steed will be exchanged for a black prelate.} Bxd5 14. Qxd5 {14. Qxd5 - now Glenda occupies that outpost!  I eye up the possibility of Nh6 threatening Qxf7+.  My opponent distracts me with a threat to my c2 pawn next move however.} Rc8 15. c3 Qb6 16. Be2 {16. Be2 - I decided to develop Fou Leblanc to pave the way for castling.  However, Henry is destined to stay in the centre of the board.  Bit dangerous when the queens are on the board.} Rc5 17. Qb3 {17. Qb3 - Glenda stays on the a2-f7 diagonal.} Qc6 18. f3 Qb6 {18. ...... Qb6 - the Wicked Witch of the West prevents castling because if I play 0-0?? now then Glenda drops to Rxc3+.} 19. a4 Rg8 20. g4 Rg5 21. h4 {21. h4 - I try to drive back the black KR but my opponent has other ideas .....} Rxf5 {21. ..... Rxf5 - an exchange sac!} 22. gxf5 {22. gxf5 - might as well accept.} Bf8 23. Qa2 {23. Qa2 - putting pressure on the a column.} b4 24. Qb3 a5 25. Bc4 {25. Bc4?? - this move condemns me to a Low Draw.  Gameknot Analysis recommended cxb4.  My opponent then threatens, after a rook retreat to defend f7, a nasty check on e3 from the Wicked Witch of the West.} Rc7 26. Ke2 {26. Ke2 - Henry tries to prevent this and it also connects the rooks but now black moves his bishoph to h6 and renews the deadly threat of Qe3+.} Bh6 27. cxb4 {27. cxb4 - at last I play this move, recommended two moves back.  It does open up a protective line from Glenda to e3 but Glenda is overloaded and black exploits this with a second exchange sacrifice.  I accept and the Witch moves in, Henry must now experience another deadly dash - thank god his seafood diet has kept him nimble despite his dotage!} Rxc4 28. Qxc4 Qe3+ 29. Kf1 Qxf3+ {29. ..... Qxf3+ - black gets a pawn back with check.  Henry must move to g1 because if Ke1?? then both rooks drop.} 30. Kg1 Be3+ {30. .... Be3+ - in comes black's dsb to join in the attack?  Can Henry survive?  If he does then I do have a 4 point material advantage to play with which could be decisive.} 31. Kh2 Qf4+ 32. Kh3 {32. Kh3 - not Kg2 as it will lead to Henry copping Old Matey, starting with the move 32. .... Qg4+.} Qf3+ 33. Kh2 Qf2+ 34. Kh3 Qf3+ 35. Kh2 Qf2+ 36. Kh3 Qf3+ {36. ...... Qf3+ - after the hypnotic last few moves, I break the trance by declaring the game drawn on the grounds of Threefold Repetition because my opponent set up conditional moves.  Even though I am still four material points to the good and am more than 100 points north of my opponent's rating there is nothing better than to settle for the perpetual.  My opponent extracts a 3.8 rating point tariff off me taking me below 1850.  Thankfully, a dour high draw against a Class B 1900+ player cancelled out the lost points here.  There will soon be another annotation posted.  In that game, Henry will get the fright of his life again from the Wicked Witch of the West, this time against a Class D player.  Thankfully that game will end in victory for Yours Truly but not without some heavy weather.  Anyhow, hope you have a good read and are enjoying this beautiful English spring weather!  Bye for now - Joanne}
