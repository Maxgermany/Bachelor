1. e4 e5 {this is the perfect set up  for the goring gambit} 2. d4 f6 {declined is still fun} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Bb5 a6 5. Bxc6 {this was a mistake I believe on black's part, but what's even more of a mistake is the following move...} dxc6 {!?!?} 6. d5 {I debated between this and Nc3 for awhile... comments on my move/missed oppurtunities?} cxd5 7. Qxd5 Qxd5 8. exd5 {This game is even... but I still think I'm ahead as far as development goes. } e4 9. Nd4 {I knew with the queen trade that this was going to happen.  a minor inconvenience. } Ne7 10. Nc3 {this is the perfect oppurtunity for the N because Ne7 blocked Bb4!} c6 11. Nxe4 {this was a great oppurtunity for me. by getting my N to d6 I could force the king to d8 which means Nf7+ for the free rook, all at the cost of a pawn(trade)} cxd5 12. Nd6+ Kd8 13. Nf7+ Kc7 14. Nxh8 Ng6 {he is now down a rook, if I were him, I'd try to hold on to my pieces instead of trading but whatever...} 15. Nxg6 hxg6 {that is one UGLY pawn structure. } 16. Bf4+ Bd6 {... does he value pieces at all?} 17. g3 g5 {g3 is to prevent a back row mate when I kingside castle} 18. Be3 b5 {I thought this was to get Bb7... but that doesn't seem right to me, besides obvioust pawn block. } 19. O-O Bc5 20. Ne6+ {a complicated trade...} Bxe6 21. Bxc5 Re8 22. Rfe1 {All of my main pieces are now off of white squares.} Kc6 23. b4 a5 24. a3 f5 25. Be3 axb4 26. axb4 f4 27. gxf4 gxf4 28. Ra6+ Kb7 {I probably should have gone Rb6 instead of my next move to take the pawn... oh well, maybe next time} 29. Ra7+ Kc6 30. Bxf4 Bd7 {ok...ok... I can deal with some more trading. } 31. Rc7+ Kb6 32. Rxe8 Bxe8 33. Rxg7 d4 34. Rg5 {this was to protect my next move...} Ka6 35. h4 {when that pawn gets to h5 it will be vulnerable, hence rook g5} Kb7 36. h5 Bxh5 {this seems like it shouts: "I'm going for stale mate!"} 37. Rxh5 Kc6 38. Be5 Kd5 39. Bf6+ Kc4 {I accidently let him slip through the ranks... I am just now seeing how much fun the move Rc5 would have been....} 40. Rh2 {this is going to do 2 things for me when he moves his king } Kc3 {I think he didn't take b4 because he knows that d is his best shot at a queen. } 41. f4 {protect and advance. } Kxb4 42. Bxd4 Kc4 43. c3 {THAT is a super structure. } Kd3 44. f5 b4 45. cxb4 Kxd4 {I sac'd my bishop for his last pawn... not a bad trade all things considered. } 46. f6 Kc4 47. f7 Kxb4 48. f8=Q+ Kc4 49. Rd2 Kc3 50. Qd8 Kc4 51. Qd4+ Kb5 52. Rc2 Ka5 53. Qa1+ Kb4 54. Qb1+ Ka3 55. Ra2# {and that's that. }
