1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bf4 {My favorite.} f5 {Interesting enough, I have to play carefully. } 4. Nbd2 Nf6 5. h3 {A loss of time, but I want to provide a square for my bishop on h2. } c6 {c5 would have been better, but not crushing... yet. } 6. e3 Be7 7. c4 {I assumed he won't play Bb4 now, but without his Be7 I wouldn't have played c4, leaving him Bb4. I'm not sure it would have been good for him even now. } Nbd7 8. c5 {I expected here b6, etc, but...} O-O {Now, I have a very good move. I had it the move before, but now it is better, because black is closed on the queenside, except for... let's see...} 9. Ng5 {Attacking e6. Now, it is funny to see that the only way for black to defend is Nb8. Nobody wants to play it, so he tries a costly adventure.} Ne4 10. Nxe6 {I will suffer from the exchange, but he has to save his queen first. } Qa5 {Qe8 and it is a plain exchange down. Better to attack. He's right. } 11. Bc7 {I started a queen chase. NxN is not possible. } Qb4 {The queen is already unconfortable here. Note that retreat was not possible. But, under normal conditions, the queen is not trapped: it threats b2, and the knight is pinned. NxN, if I leave him, will exchange it, and he will save the rook. But...} 12. a3 Qxb2 {A poisoned pawn. Qc3 maybe was better, since it doesn't unpin the knight (the key). If Rc1, Qxa3, and otherwise, I must offer a queen's exchange, giving him tempo to save the rook. } 13. Nxe4 fxe4 14. Nxf8 {Ok, the rook is mine. } Qc3+ {Very good, he takes my castling and cramps me. } 15. Ke2 {I still cannot play Rc1, but now I am not worried: a queen's exchange is in my favour, so Qc1 will work. If Qd3+, Ke1 and... what? Black has no other pieces to support his attack. } Qc4+ {A deadly overlook. } 16. Kd2 {Really, really unusual. The king helps trapping a queen! No way to save it. QxB, RxQ, KxN leaves white with overwhelming material advantage. I cannot blame him for not seeing this. All started with Nd7, that left e6 unprotected. } Qb3 17. Qxb3 {}
