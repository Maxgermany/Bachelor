1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. O-O O-O 5. d3 d5 6. Nbd2 c5 7. e4 Nc6 8. Re1 e5 {I've made all book moves so far. Now I need to decide what's next. I won't trade on d5 because I don't want to give up my only presence in the center.} 9. c3 {Instead, I use the c3 move again to keep his knight on his side of the board and give my queen access to b3.} h6 {I don't believe that he's preparing g5, so it must be to keep my knight off of g5. Not sure why that's a concern. Does he think I wanted to play Ng5-h3 and then use it there to support f4? Maybe if my rook were still on f1.} 10. exd5 {After not wanting to give up my center pawn a couple of moves earlier, I feel ready to do it now. It's because I want to give my knight a more aggressive square.} Nxd5 11. Nc4 Re8 12. Qb3 {I also have Ne3 in the back of my head. The thing about Qb3 is I think it anchors his bishop to c8 for now, and I have an interesting queen and bishop attack on d5 once both of my knights have made trades on e5. The queen also stops b5, which would chase away my nice knight.} Nc7 {He sees it, of course, and retreats.} 13. Be3 {I liked e3 for the knight and the bishop. I ultimately decided on the bishop because my knight already has a good square, and I need to get the bishop out. And now that his knight's been chased away, I don't have to worry about a trade. I do have to wonder what I'll do if he plays b5, because now it's guarded by the knight. If he doesn't make that move, I may want to play a4 to help keep my knight on c4.} b6 14. Ng5 {I kept looking at Nfxe5, but after Black plays Nxe5, all I see are a whole bunch of trades, and everything ends up kind of even. But Ng5 looks like it works out okay because instead of Black being able to get his knight on c6 out of the way, I can take it and fork the rooks. And if he ignores the knight, I'm capturing on f7 with all kinds of discovered threats.} hxg5 15. Bxc6 Be6 16. Bxe8 Nxe8 17. Qc2 {I need to unpin my knight. Also, I've got a hole on my kingside, so I've got to get my queen back to help protect g2.} Bd5 18. Qe2 Nc7 19. Bd2 {I would've loved to play Qg4. If I thought he would play f6, then I would sacrifice my bishop on g4. (That black bishop is more of an obstruction than a help right now.) Then, I'd also get the pawn on e4 with my knight and have some open spaces for my rooks.  The great thing about being ahead by two pawns is that I can give one or two back and still not be losing! But I'm worried about Ne6 which seems to tie everything up even more. So in the end, I decided on Bd2 to attack the pawn on e5. But I worry that my queen is guarding the pawn on d3 and the bishop on d2, and if the knight captures on e5, she'll be guarding it, too. That's an overworked piece and something he'll take advantage of.} Bb7 {Okay, Korchnoi, what are you trying to pull, here? He's rated higher than I am; I know that he's not leaving a pawn for me to take. Let's see. after Nxe5, what do I do against Qd5 (threatening Qg2# and Qh1#)? I guess I have to do Qe4, and we trade, and I lost my N on e5 to his bishop. I feel like it's a choice between to Rad1, and then I might be more willing to trade queens and give my knight for two pawns. Or the other choice is a4 so his knight can't go to c5.} 20. Rad1 f6 {It says I'm up by two pawns, but it's hard to see it. My bishop on d2 can't go anywhere, and he has all of the threats along the b7-h1 diagonal. He's got the most credible threat, which is Qd5, threatening Qg2# and Qh1#. About all I see for now is f3. I think I'd like to get my knight over to e4 to block that bishop.} 21. f3 Qd7 {Okay, I'm tired of having my pieces all bottled up and the extra rook I have being less valuable than the extra bishop he has.} 22. Bxg5 fxg5 23. Nxe5 Bxe5 {So he took the knight. Okay, I'm ready to drive to the endgame and see what happens. I just submitted a sequence of five conditional moves to trade down to R+7P vs R+N+3P ending.} 24. Qxe5 Bxf3 25. Qxg5 Bxd1 26. Qxg6+ Qg7 27. Qxg7+ Kxg7 28. Rxd1 Re8 {He offers a draw. I need the practice with my endgame, but I kind of feel fortunate to be in a position to get a draw against him. Looking at our team score, we're down 0-2 already with 4 games left. My other teammate's games are early, but they look split, but I feel like I'm worse off in my other game.  So everything points to continuing except for my confidence. :(}
