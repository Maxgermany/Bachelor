1. c4 {I very seldom face the English opening. } Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. e4 Bc5 4. d3 {White goes for a closed game.} d6 {I am one step to have my dsb trapped.} 5. h3 {Understandable, otherwise Ng4 is strong on f2.} c6 6. f4 {To get something, you have to concede something else. So...} Qa5 7. f5 {...I accept a strong kingside attack. while developing a dubious attack on the queenside. } Na6 8. a3 {White misses to move his dsb to make this a threat.} d5 {Bd4 would have been natural, but Bd2 just balances it. } 9. b4 {?} Nxb4 {? better was Bx, because...} 10. axb4 Qxa1 11. bxc5 {...I'll lose my dsb anyway. } Qxc3+ {I am +3, but...} 12. Bd2 Qa3 {...my Q is a little useless, while white can develop his kingside attack now. } 13. cxd5 {I didn't know what to play, here, but I thought that...} Qxc5 {...gives my Q better prospects, while...} 14. dxc6 bxc6 {...helps my lsb to come into the game quickly. This was a very questionable way of thinking!} 15. g4 {Why I didn't take on d5 before? Now I'm in great danger. } Ba6 {The alternate plan, a5-a4 etc. was too slow!} 16. g5 Nd7 17. Nf3 {White had better moves, like Qa1, threatening my B and then Nf3, threatening e5. } Qa3 {Threatening d6, and making white...} 18. Qc2 {c6 will be a permanent weakness, so...} Rc8 {Sigh!} 19. Kf2 {Securing the king, instead of developing. It was not a good choice. } Nc5 {? I was so obsessed by d3 that I couldn't see the obvious...} 20. Nxe5 {Fortunately, his Q is not on the right spot to come into my kinside, so I can do...} f6 21. gxf6 gxf6 22. Nc4 {This N threats a fork on d6, and Kd2 blocks the d column for my R to help in the attack, so, sadly...} Bxc4 23. dxc4 {? Qx was much better, in my view!} Rd8 {? Bc3 was a strong move for white, but he played...} 24. Be2 {Rg8 was very strong, but I needed to make something of my position.} Nd3+ 25. Kg2 {? White had it better to exchange, but he wanted to keep the B for a kingside attack. } Rg8+ {Of course...} 26. Kf1 {Bg4 wouldn't have worked due to h5. } Qa1+ {This is played in order to have my Q on d4. It's only matter of tempos, here... Qc5 wouldn't work because of QxN} 27. Bd1 Qd4 {Threatening mate AND Qg1. Bc3 allows Qxc4, but it was still better. } 28. Bh5+ {If Kf8, Bh6+, recovering material with advantage. } Ke7 {White's only defence was Be1, but then Qxe4. But...} 29. Rh2 {?? ... is even worse. White lost the game here. } Qg1+ 30. Ke2 Qxh2+ 31. Ke3 Rg3+ 32. Bf3 Qf2# {A light game, which demonstrate the power of a N on the 3rd enemy's rank!}
