1. e4 e6 {The French, to which White's automatic reply is 2. d4} 2. Nf3 {but for some reason I improvised with this...} d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. d4 Bd6 {A good aggressive posting for Black's B.} 5. c4 Qe7+ 6. Be3 {Seems to avoid over-burdening the KB} Nf6 {threatens to attack the pinned B} 7. h3 {? prevents ...Ng4 but creates a hole at g3.  The pawn on f2 can't protect both g3 and e3 at the same time.} O-O 8. Qd2 {? failing to notice Black's obvious response} Ne4 9. Qe2 dxc4 10. Qxc4 Re8 11. Nbd2 Nxf2 {and in disgust I resigned.  I'd spent ages obsessing about g3 and missed the danger to f2.  If 12. Kxf2 Qxe3#  12. Ne5 is probably best but leaves White's position looking ruined after 12... Bxe5 13. dxe5 Qxe5 with both Be3 and Rh1 still threatened, the Be3 pinned and mate threatened if I allow the Be3 to be captured.}
