1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I bet you are asking yourselves, disaster for whom?  Well, you only need one guess.  This performance was as bad as the Fried Fox Pork Chop Affair.  I am taking part in a mini-tournament organised by the Master Mater called The Annotations Project.  This is where we will be brainstorming an opening which involves a Q for 2 piece sacrifice arising out of the Sicilian Grand Prix Attack.  The first seven moves were set up as forced moves.  The action therefore starts on move 8 after Henry was forced to go to d7.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 {8. ....... Kc6.  If you look at this link - http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/speculate-to-accumulate.pl?gm=21163 I played Henry to c7 that time.  Here I decided to deviate with Kc6.} 9. Bxg4 Qd6 {9. ....... Qd6 - has a fairly reasonable record in the Gameknot db.  Master Freddy played this move against someone else in the same tournament and won with it so I thought that the move was OK here.  Glenda does actually attack the pawn on f5.  Alas, that is about the only thing she attacks in this game I do think!} 10. d3 exd3 {10. ...... exd3 - In retrospect, although Master Freddy also took the pawn on d6 in his game I now think that it was probably an unnecessary waste of tempo.  Perhaps Na3 or g6 were better here.} 11. Nc3 Kb6 12. Be3 {12. Be3! - here Freddy's opponent castled.  Freddy played a very strong move here, developing a piece and exerting pressure on c5, in fact also lining up on the same diagonal as Henry!} Na6 13. Nf7 Qg6 {13. ...... Qg6?? - here Freddy said that this was a bad move.  I did not see why until the following sequence.  I thought my rook was going to be lost so I thought it was a good idea for Glenda to strike out at the white lsb.  Alas, Freddy is not interested in the rook.  His knight goes to e5 with check!} 14. Nd5+ Ka5 {14. ...... Ka5 - Henry seems safe here but an attack on Glenda - the white knight simultaneously defends the lsb, gains Freddy a vital attacking tempo.} 15. Ne5 Qe4 16. Bf3 Qa4 {16. ........ Qa4 - Glenda must move again.} 17. Bd2+ Nb4 18. Nc4+ {18. Nc4+ - Freddy's horsies give me knightmares!!!!} Kb5 {18. ....... Kb5 - if Ka6 then Nc7 is mate!} 19. Nc7+ Kxc4 {19. ...... Kxc4 - forced.} 20. b3+ {20. b3+ - a nasty royal pawn fork.  It is also mate next move.} Kd4 21. Ne6# {21. Ne6# - a pretty knight mate.  Freddy could have also played c3 here - that would have also resulted in me getting Freddied yet again!  Anyhow, all credit to Freddy for taking full advantage of my mistakes!}
