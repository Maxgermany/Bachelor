[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 {Hey all! Here's part two of my contribution to this team match. This time I have the White pieces, and rather than the aggressive tactical slugfest of the previous game, this time a complex positional duel is the order of the day. Enjoy!} Nf6 2. b3 e6 3. Bb2 c6 {I won't comment much on the opening; it's a very reserved Anglo-Indian setup. Unbeknownst to me at the time, we stay on-book for the first ten moves or so.} 4. Nc3 d5 5. e3 Bd6 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. d4 O-O 8. Bd3 Re8 {Black is prepared to bust through the center and bring the position to life.} 9. O-O e5 {The thematic break arrives, not that White tried particularly hard to stifle it. In hindsight I probably would have tried to make this a little more difficult for Black, though it's not immediately clear how.} 10. dxe5 Nxe5 11. Be2 {? My first concrete mistake. I need to be looking at cxd5, because right now, Black can give me a weak, isolated c-pawn with 11...Nxf3 12.Bxf3 dxc4 13.bxc4. It's not huge; I don't lose material, but it's a weakness to be exploited as the game goes on, and there's no reason to allow it.} Nxf3+ 12. Bxf3 Qc7 {Gunning at h2, though with the Bf3, there's not a lot of oomph behind the threat. White doesn't have to--indeed, he shouldn't--respond to it at all! Check it out: 13.cxd5! Bxh2+ 14.Kh1 Bd6 (or else I trap and win the Bishop) 15.dxc6 bxc6 and White may have a slight advantage despite his King being open to the air. Of course, I missed this at the time.} 13. g3 {? See above; 13.cxd5 was better.} Bh3 14. Re1 dxc4 15. bxc4 {Now I'm stuck with the weak c-pawn I should have been worried about.} Bb4 16. Qb3 a5 17. a3 Bc5 {Let's take stock of the position briefly. Material is equal and the center is contested. Black's Queen is tied to the defense of b7, while White's Queen has only limited mobility. Black's King is a bit safer, and his overall pawn structure is more stable. Black has more active pieces at a glance, but they don't actually have many immediate prospects. White has the move. Long story short, the position is very nearly equal, probably with a slight advantage to Black.} 18. Rad1 Red8 19. Ne4 {The computer considers this inaccurate, and I'm inclined to agree. The intent is to kick the Black DSB and free the White one, but mostly what this accomplishes is letting Black trade off his somewhat weak Knight. If I had it to do again, I'd play 19.Na4 here.} Nxe4 20. Bxe4 Be6 {Pinning the weak pawn to the WQ, and she to its defense. How undignified.} 21. f4 {I was struggling, at the time, to get my pieces working together. This move was intended to allow my King to move up to f2 and generally free up my kingside, but mostly it just gives Black a bunch of weak light squares to jump around on. The other move I was considering at the time was 21.Bd4, and I think now that that was the right choice. If I could convince Black to exchange there, it would largely remove the weakness of my c-pawn (by placing a pawn on the d-file next to it).} Bg4 {Only logical, now that I can't block it with the pawn anymore.} 22. Rd3 {Perhaps 22.Rxd8 Qxd8 23.Qc2 would have been better, to forestall Black's next move, which severely cramps White's game.} f5 {This is very strong. Thanks in part to the Rook, White's Bishop has a really not-so-good outlook.} 23. Bg2 Rxd3 24. Qxd3 Rd8 25. Qc3 {Time to evaluate the board again. Material is still even; the center still contested. White has noticeable pawn weaknesses; Black not so much. Both sides have a good Bishop and a bad one, but Black's are more effective overall, and Black's Rook is far superior. White's King is a bit safer than Black's, thanks in large part to the threat of Qxg7#, currently being defended by the BQ. Everything is developed, but Black has better overall activity and a little more space. I'd definitely give Black a small advantage here, but it's still anybody's game.} b6 {? Scroll back up a second, to the previous move. Black had a definite, if small, advantage. This one pawn move turns it all around. Thanks to the one single threat on the board for White, there is now a move that tips the scales back the other way.} 26. Bxc6 {! White snaps up the c6 pawn, winning the material but more importantly gaining space in the center and activating his good Bishop because now d5 is available. Of course Black must not play 26...Qxc6?? because of 27.Qxg7#} Bxa3 {?! This is a tricky play to try to regain material equality. Of course if White captures on a3, he no longer has a mating threat and the BQ is free to recoup the Bc6, with the advantage. But White has no need to take the Bishop right away--he has a zwischenzug available!} 27. Bd5+ {The Bishop no longer en prise, White will be free to capture on a3 after the BK moves, and he'll be up a full piece.} Rxd5 {! The best move. Black can reduce and attempt to draw by the power of his queenside pawns, even behind a Rook to a Bishop.} 28. cxd5 Bc5 {? I think 28...Qxc3 29.Bxc3 Bf3 was certainly better. Black is going to be hard-pressed to play for a win at this point, and he'll have a much better time drawing with the Queens off the board.} 29. Rc1 Qe7 {Getting out of the pin and threatening to win back the lost material with ...Bxe3+ and an easy draw with Bishops of opposite colors.} 30. Kf2 Kf8 31. Qe5 {White finally offers the Queen trade--but on extremely favorable terms. There is little Black can do at this point but accept.} Qxe5 32. fxe5 Ke7 {With connected passed pawns and a Rook to Black's Bishop (nearly a whole Rook anyway, considering how useless Black's LSB is now that there's nothing for it to support), White's victory from here is straightforward.} 33. Bd4 Ba3 34. Rc7+ Kf8 35. e6 {The net is closing.} Bd6 36. Bxg7+ Ke8 {or 36...Kg8 37.Rd7. The text sets up a prettier combination for the finish.} 37. Rc8+ Ke7 38. Bf8+ {Winning the Bishop, and with it any hopes Black might have been harboring of saving the game.} Kf6 39. Bxd6 {1-0. Faced with a ruinous material deficit and an imminent promotion, Black resigns. There were really only a couple of very small errors--inaccuracies on both sides, for sure. Any comments that you better players might have, things I've missed--they'd all be much appreciated; I know I don't understand these positions as well as I might. Many thanks to toughplaya for a great match, and thank you for reading!}
