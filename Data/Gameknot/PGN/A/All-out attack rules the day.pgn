[Opening "KGA (C36), Abbazia defence, modern variation"]

1. e4 {I start most of my games with e4 or d4, with both moves claiming the center for white.} e5 {My opponent responds with e5, a move with the same purpose as white's first.} 2. f4 {I decided to go with the king gambit. It immediately attacks the e5 pawn, but it weakens the e1-h4 diagonal, which can be used by black with a timely Qh4+. This opening sacrifices a pawn for fast developpement.} exf4 {Black accepts. Other moves included d6 and Bc4.} 3. Nf3 {The main follow up for white. It develops a piece, prevents Qh4+ and protects some central squares.} d5 {!? This is new to me. It attacks my currently unprotected e4 pawn, and it allows to develop the light squared bishop. This is called the Abbazia defense.} 4. exd5 {I take his pawn.} Qxd5 {I believe that Nf6, attacking the d pawn once more, is slightly better. It avoids the following move by white.} 5. Nc3 {I develop my queenside knight while gaining a tempi on his queen.} Qa5 {The best square for the queen. It can't be attacked soon, and it doesn't hinder black's developpement. The idea is similar to the scandinavian defense. (1. e4 d5!? 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5)} 6. d4 {Logical. It frees my dark squared bishop and controls some important central squares. It also pins my own knight to the king though.} Bd6 {simple developpement, and protecting black's f4 pawn.} 7. Bd2 {I unpin my knight while threatening a discovered attack on his queen.} Qb6 {My opponent retreats his queen while attacking my b2 and d4 pawns.} 8. Bc4 {I ignore my b2 pawn, and opt to develop my other bishop while aiming at the weak f7 square. It also prepare kingside castling. My b2 pawn is somewhat poisonous after 8. Bc4 Qxb2?! 9. Rb1 Qa3. (The black queen is misplaced)} Bg4 {?! Although this move seems good, it is not. GK thinks this is a mistake. It pins my knight, which could be annoying. However, some pins can be converted into discovered attack... Mistake: +2.13 » … Bg4 8. Na4 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 Qxd4 10. Qxb7 Qxc4 11. Qxa8 c6 12. Qxa7 Qxc2 13. Rf1 Best: +0.91 » … Be6 8. Qe2 Ne7 9. Bxe6 fxe6 10. O-O-O Nbc6 11. Rhe1 Nd8 12. Ng5 O-O 13. Nxe6 Nxe6 14. Qxe6+ } 9. Bxf7+ {?! This move is a blunder, but it is hard to find the correct moves for black in order to refute this sacrifice. Anyway, it forces the black king to move, which prevents black from castling. } Kxf7 {Black takes.} 10. Ng5+ {The only logical follow-up. I check the black king while attacking his bishop with my queen.} Ke8 {? The king retreats to his original square. However, this is a mistake. The counter-intuitive Kg6 was better for black. GK recommend this line:  Best: -2.21 » … Kg6 10. Qxg4 Nf6 11. Qh4 Re8+ 12. Kd1 Nc6 13. Kc1 Nxd4 14. Nf3 Nxf3 15. gxf3 Rad8 16. Bxf4 Bxf4+ 17. Qxf4} 11. Qxg4 {Material is now equal, but I have 4 piece developped against 2 for black and the black king can't castle anymore. I definitely have an advantage here.} Ne7 {My opponent develops a piece while protecting his king; not a bad choice.} 12. O-O-O {I castle queenside in order to put my king to safety and to put a rook on the promising central files.} Nbc6 {Simple developpement} 13. Rhe1 {I place my king's rook onto the e file, as it pins the knight to the king.} Qxd4 {My opponent takes my unprotected d pawn. However, all my pieces are pointing the enemy king, which is stuck in the middle...} 14. Ne6 {! With every pieces ready to attack, it's time to take on black's central fortress. This is the beginning of a great all-out attack. For now, this knight is going to be real pain to black. It forks the queen, the g7 pawn and the c7 pawn.} Qf6 {My opponent secures his queen. How to proceed?} 15. Nd5 {!? Although this is objectively not the best move, it sure packs a punch. I now fork the queen, the e7 knight and the c7 pawn. 15. ... Nxd5?! is met by 16. Nxc7+! (double check) any K move 17. Nxd5, which would furthermore open the black king position.} Rc8 {?? Black misses the attack on the queen.} 16. Nxf6+ {I gladly take the material advantage, as the black king is STILL under heavy pressure.} gxf6 {Black retakes.} 17. Bxf4 {! I get my bishop into play as well as my rook while I take the f4 pawn.} Rg8 {? Black attacks my queen, but missed...} 18. Nxc7+ {Nxd7+!! This move checks the black king, pins the black knight, forks both rooks AND is a sacrifice. I don't see these moves everyday! The knight is immune. If black plays 18. ... Bxc7, I respond with 19.Qxg8# (The e7 knight is pinned). The same applies for 18. ... Rxc7 19. Qxg8+ Kd7 20. Rxd6#. The king has to move. 18. ... Kd8 is met by 19. Rxd6 Kxc7 20. Qd7+ Kb6 (20. ... Kb8 21. Rxc6+! Ka8 22. Rxe7! and mate is unstoppable) 21. Rxe7 and white is crushing. Black must play either Kf8 or Kf7.} Kf8 {? Unfortunately, Kf7 was better for black.} 19. Bh6+ {I gain a tempo on 18. ... Kf7.} Kf7 {Forced (19. ... Rg7 20. Qxg7#)} 20. Qe6+ {I continue my deadly assault on the black king with my queen, supported by my handy rooks.} Kg6 {Forced} 21. Rxd6 {! I capture his bishop and treaten his f6 pawn while leaving my bishop and knight hanging.} Kxh6 {Blacks takes my hanging bishop, but his king is in a mating net...} 22. Qxf6+ {! (obviously) Logical follow up} Rg6 {Only move (24. ... Kh5 25. g4+! Kxg4 (25... Rxg4 26. Qxh6#) 26. Rg1+ any K move 27. Qh6#)} 23. Qh4+ {Forcing the black king to go to g7} Kg7 {Forced} 24. Rxe7+ {! The best way to continue the attack} Nxe7 {Obviously} 25. Qxe7+ {I capture the knight, with check.} Kh6 {Black tries to escape.} 26. Qh4+ {"No way, sir. You are not allowed to escape this way!" } Kg7 {Forced, yet again.} 27. Rd7+ {! The black king must now go into the 8th file.} Kg8 {This and 27. ... Kf8 is met by the same move, which is...} 28. Qxh7+ {1-0  The black king must go to f8, where white would play 29.Qf7#.  I hope you liked this great game as I did.
