1. e4 {Hello. Here is an interesting and enjoyable game that I recently played. I am playing with the black pieces, and again I respond to 1.e4 with my favourite defence: The Sicilian. I manage to gain an advantage of 1 pawn in the middle game, which eventually converted to a win, after a hard-fought endgame. Here is a link to the Gameknot anaylsis if you are interested: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17509783&fb=1&rnd=0.2053531357087195.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 {Black exchanges the pawn, trading his c pawn for whites d pawn. Black hopes for a strong centre later in the game.} 4. Nxd4 {In this position, neither player wants to take the knight, as doing so would benefit the opponent, regardless of which player initiates the exchange.} Nf6 {All book moves so far. Black attacks the undefended e pawn.} 5. Nc3 {And white obliges to defend it, whilst developing a minor piece.} d6 {I used to play 5...e5 in this position, but I feel that this move allows more flexibility in the centre. e5 leads to a closed centre, and potential weaknesses on the Queenside dark squares, which white may be able to exploit later in the game. With this move, I make room for my LSB, and wait to see what my opponent plays before deciding how to contest the centre of the board.} 6. Bb5 {Pins my knight and threatens to win a pawn.} Bd7 {Neutralising the threat with development.} 7. O-O g6 {I plan to put my DSB on the long diagonal, where it will have plenty of targets. This is also another reason why I prefer not to play 5...e4.} 8. Bg5 {According to the gameknot anaylsis, this is the first non-book move, although perfectly playable IMO. Alternatives may have been Bd2.} Bg7 {Development and preventing damage to my pawn structure if BxN.} 9. Nxc6 {Nxc6, Knight exchange.} bxc6 {I retake with tempo. I didn't want to swap pieces at this point, and I was not worried about having an isolated pawn on the a file.} 10. Be2 Rb8 {My Queens Rook takes control of the half-open b file.} 11. Rb1 {b3 is not advisable due to the DSB on g7, so white has to defend with the rook. Here blacks Queen's Rook has much more power than whites.} Qa5 {Attacking the bishop on g5 and trying to complicate the position. Moving the Queen tends to alter the position significantly, making mistakes more likely.} 12. Bd2 {Enables a discovered attack on the black Queen, but blocks whites Queen for a few moves.} Qe5 {Escaping the potential discovered attack, and increasing the pressure on the e pawn. The pawn is looking a bit lonely there in the middle of the board!} 13. f3 {I was expecting black to defend with the LSB here, as this move exposes the King. However, in hindsight, this move is probably better, as it also prevents my knight from landing on g4. Now I must move my LSB before I can move my Knight on f6, releasing the power of the DSB. Black is significantly more cramped than white, but it's not a problem yet. Gameknot gives white a very slight at this stage.} O-O {Here I considered Qc5+ to gain control of the open g1-a7 diagonal, but I could not see it leading to anything useful, so I just decided to play it safe and castle.} 14. Be3 {A good move, as it attacks my undefended and isolated a pawn, takes full control of the nice diagonal, and frees up the Queen.} Qa5 {I also considered playing c5 to close off the diagonal, but it would have restricted my Queen too much, I decided this was a better way to proceed.} 15. Qd2 {I thought white was looking to play Rfd8, but it seemed he had other intentions.} Be6 {Creating space to play Nd7, and threatening the pawn on a2.} 16. a3 Rb7 {Defends my a pawn and creates the possibility to double my rooks on the important b file.} 17. b4 {Qxa3 looks like a trap. At the time, I didn't fully understand why, but I didn't want to risk it. I assumed the my opponent would not leave a pawn hanging without adequate compensation, so I played it safe...} Qc7 18. Kh1 Rfb8 {Rfb8? This move is a mistake which allows white to win the exchange with 19. Ba6! Rb6 20. Bxb6 axb6. Which may well have been a decisive advantage in this game. Luckily for me my opponent also missed this.} 19. Bh6 {?!} Bxh6 {Although I was hesitant to exchange my DSB on the long diagonal, I saw that by dragging his Queen over to h6 where it would not be doing much, I should be able to cause my opponent some problems on the Queenside, maybe winning a pawn in the process.} 20. Qxh6 a5 21. bxa5 {Gameknot flags bxa5 as an inaccuracy, suggesting that Qd2 was a better move. bxa5 allows my Queen to quickly become more active.} Qxa5 22. Rxb7 {White exchanges presumably to try and save the a pawn; but at this point it is already impossible.} Rxb7 23. Nb1 Ba2 24. Qd2 Ra7 {Rb2 was perhaps a better move here.} 25. Qc3 {An inaccuracy. Gameknot suggests that Qd4 was better. I was about to be a pawn up, and white has an isolated c pawn, whilst my pawn structure is solid, so I did not have to think too much about exchanging Queens here!} Qxc3 26. Nxc3 Rxa3 {Finally I win the pawn, and protect the bishop.} 27. Nxa2 {Another set of minor pieces is exchanged, and we start to enter the endgame. In this kind of position, I felt that a bishop really has no advantage over a knight. I was happy with the exchange.} Rxa2 {Also the rook gains a good position on the 7th rank, which seriously locks down whites position. The rook stays here for 13 moves! As well as attacking and pinning the c pawn, it later prevents whites King from getting to the centre which is highly significant.} 28. Bd3 {The bishop tries to disguise himself as a pawn.} Nd7 {The knight had no good squares to move to on f6. Now it can move towards the centre, attacking the bishop, and also the f pawn is now mobile.} 29. Rc1 {Anticipating Ne5 or Nc5; Rc1 enables the bishop to move, but the rook is the most powerful piece in the game now, and all he is doing is defending a lonely pawn on the second rank. Black has a good advantage here. Around this time my opponent said to me that he would be happy with a draw. Whilst I was certainly playing to win, I was well aware that it would only take a small mistake for me to lose the advantage.} Ne5 {Threatening to exchange the N for B. perhaps Nc5 was a better move here.} 30. Be2 {Prevents the exchange, but the c pawn is again pinned. Blacks position is much more active.} e6 {Preparing f5. I did not want to leave the h pawn isolated.} 31. Kg1 f5 {Gameknot says my advantage goes from +1.55 to +0.80 with this move; but I do not understand why. The bad thing about the Gameknot analysis is that you have to make quite a serious inaccuracy for it to be flagged.} 32. Kf1 {Gameknot prefers f4, followed by exf5, and white's position suddenly looks much better. (See analysis)} fxe4 {Pawn exchange.} 33. fxe4 {Now white has 2 isolated pawns.} Kf7 {It's time for my King to get into the action!} 34. c4 {I think white should have followed suit with Kf2.} Kf6 35. Rd1 Nf7 {Defends d6 and makes space for my King to cause problems for white in the centre.} 36. h3 Ke5 37. Bd3 {Defends e4.} Ng5 {There was probably a better move here...} 38. h4 {As white points out...} Nf7 39. Be2 h5 {Preventing any thoughts about Bg4.} 40. Bf3 {Achieves nothing; Kxe4 was not a good idea anyway.} Rc2 41. Be2 {White's bishop is tied down to defence, and it seems both players do not have a good idea about how to proceed.} Nh6 {But I thought I must get my Knight into the centre.} 42. Bd3 Ra2 43. Be2 {White seems to be totally locked down. If he wants to protect both pawns his rook must be on the d file. Anything else and white will lose a pawn, probably giving black a decisive advantage.} Ng4 44. Bxg4 {Bxg4?1 Although not flagged as a mistake by GK, after exchanging the minor pieces it is difficult to see how white can prevent his material deficit from growing. I suppose white was hoping for counter play on the h-file.} hxg4 45. Rb1 Rc2 46. Rb4 {An immediate Rb8 was probably better.} c5 {Now the c pawn is defended.} 47. Rb8 g3 {Allows my rook access to the f-file, with tempo, but perhaps simply Rxc4 was better. } 48. Rg8 Rf2+ 49. Ke1 Rf6 {I preferred to defend my g-pawn. I didn't want to calculate the possibilities of whites h pawn becoming passed.} 50. h5 gxh5 51. Rxg3 h4 52. Rg4 Rf4 {The final mistake by white, which leads him to resign, as black will end up taking both the e and c pawns for free! I would like to thank my opponent Michael putting up a great fight, and allowing such an enjoyable and interesting game. Comments and ratings are very welcome. Ciao for now!} 53. Rxf4 {}
