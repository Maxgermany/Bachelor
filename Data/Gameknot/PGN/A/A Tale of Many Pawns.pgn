[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {The Bishop's Game. Not the most popular anymore, but theoretically equal, and with some good chances for White if Black is unprepared.} Nf6 {This is the Berlin Defence, probably the most standard modern reply.} 3. Nc3 {Transposing to the Vienna Game.} Bb4 {3...Bc5 or 3...Nc6 are more standard here. The text move leads to exciting, probably-equal play, falling somewhere between those calmer lines and the wild Frankenstein-Dracula variation (3...Nxe5!? 4.Qh5+ Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5 g6 7.Qf3 f5 8.Qd5 Qe7 9.Nxc7+ Kd8 10.Nxa8 b6).} 4. d3 {4.f4 is the book move here, not that we're at all off the GK database yet. The main intent of the Vienna Game, though, is generally for White to transpose into a favorable line of the King's Gambit. There's no danger of Black winning the e-pawn for free, because 4.f4 Bxc3 is met with 5.dxc3 Nxe4 6.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qd5+ and White wins the Knight back with a strong position.} O-O 5. a3 {?! Now we're off the GK database; this move just begs Black to inflict some doubled pawns on the White queenside.} Bxc3+ {Black accepts the offer.} 6. bxc3 a6 7. Nf3 d6 8. h4 {?! White proposes a nasty kingside attack, but forfeits the ability to drive a Black Bishop away from g4.} Bg4 9. Bg5 Nbd7 10. Qd2 {It's hard to say what the right thing to do here is. The text allows Black to further mangle White's pawn structure, but there's no way to drive off the Bishop, either. Maybe Qe2-e3??} Bxf3 11. gxf3 c6 {Preparing ...b5.} 12. O-O-O {White connects his Rooks for a kingside assault.} b5 13. Bb3 Qb6 {!? Black unpins his Queen, threatens f2, and begins an attempt to restrict White from playing d3-d4. She's now far from being able to defend the kingside, though, so Black will need active counterplay to avoid being run over.} 14. Rdg1 {Game on. Everything White has is aimed at the BK.} Nh5 {Black adds a defender for g7 momentarily, but this Knight is destined for f4, in an attempt to shut the WQ out of the attack or force a trade to lessen the pressure.} 15. Be7 {Not only the Rook is in danger here--moving that Rook invites 16.Bxf7+ or 16.Qh6!, with a huge attack.} Nf4 {! This sacrifice shuts down White's attack entirely, for if 16.Bxf8 Rxf8, White has exchanged a powerful, aggressive piece for an entirely passive one of his opponent's. 15...Nf4! also shuts the WQ out of the attack, and thanks to the doubled pawns it is completely untouchable without at least an even exchange--which is to say, a favorable exchange for Black.} 16. Bxf8 {? I think 16.Bxd6 or 16.Bg5 followed by Bxf4 would have been much better. White wins the exchange, but effectively forfeits his aggressive options, and can no longer do anything at all about Black's Nf4.} Nxf8 {Leaving the Rook on the queenside to create problems for White, and relocating the Knight to a more useful spot where it can reach g6 or e6.} 17. h5 {White continues to press, but he doesn't really have any way to proceed.} Nf8e6 18. Bxe6 {?! This Bishop was a critical piece of White's remaining kingside aggression. White is perhaps hoping for 18...Nxe6?? 19.Qh6, but he's not that lucky.} fxe6 19. d4 {Trying to remove the e5 pawn defending the Black Knight.} Rd8 {If 20.dxe4 dxe4 and there's no way for White to get rid of the pawn defending Black's bothersome Knight.} 20. Rg3 {Preparing to double Rooks on the g-file and thunder down on the BK.} Kh8 21. Rg4 {?! White seems prepared to take the Knight by force, giving back his material advantage if he has to--he simply has no way to make headway against the BK without his Queen in the picture. Look at that pretty white cage she's trapped in.} Qa5 {With the obvious threat of ...Qxa3+ and suddenly Black will have an attack that White can neither ignore, nor properly defend.} 22. Kb2 {The only way for White to shore up a3 and c3.} c5 {Black threatens to win at least a pawn with ...cxd4, as White cannot retake; his c-pawn is pinned to his undefended Queen. Additionally, the weak c3 pawn itself is coming under fire.} 23. Rhg1 {I think 23.Qe3 might have been stronger here, to prevent Black's onrushing queenside incursion, but now White's battery is prepared, and he invites Black to play ...Nxh5?, defending g7 and winning a pawn--anything to get that Knight off of f4, because if that happens, White's forces spring back to life in an instant.} cxd4 {! This pawn is worth much more than the h-pawn (especially since 23...Nxh5? is met by 24.Qg5! g6 25.Rh1 with a winning attack (thanks to tiger_lilov for the continuation)). Black is also looking to force a trade of Queens, and with the WQ gone and no more reason to block that diagonal, Black's heroic Knight will have one final blow to deal to the White forces--24.Rxg7?? dxc3+! 25.Qxc3 Qxc3+ 26.Kxc3 Ne2+!} 24. Kb3 {The only way to avoid Black forcing the Queens off the board.} dxc3 25. Qxc3 {?? I debated rating this only a mistake, but I really think this is the blunder that costs White the game. After this exchange he will be behind in material and have a vastly inferior pawn structure. 25.Qe3 would have been a far better choice, threatening to get behind the Black lines to deadly effect with Qa7.} Qxc3+ 26. Kxc3 Ne2+ 27. Kb4 Nxg1 28. Rxg1 Rc8 {Now it's down to a Rook-and-Pawn endgame--White has an advantage in superior King placement, but his pawns are tremendously vulnerable, and Black has the initiative.} 29. c3 Kg8 30. Rc1 {Threatening c3-c4 and Rc3, trading off a weak White pawn for a strong Black one.} d5 {Black invites White to further cripple himself by undoubling the Black e-pawns and isolating the already-weak White f-pawns. This move also forestalls c3-c4.} 31. Rd1 Rc4+ {Defending the d-pawn with style.} 32. Kb3 {32.Ka5 Ra4+ 33.Kb6 d4 isn't much better.} d4 33. cxd4 {White doesn't have much choice in the matter.} exd4 34. Rd3 e5 35. a4 {?? White overlooks that the Rook can capture without any detriment to Black's position. He was already lost, but this clinches it, as now Black will have passed pawns on both sides of the board.} Rxa4 36. f4 {A good try, isolating the d-pawn and setting White's e-pawn free.} exf4 37. Rf3 Rc4 {Black prevents the WK from coming near the d-pawn.} 38. Rxf4 d3 {Advancing with a pin on e4. } 39. Rf5 {If now 39...Rxe4 40.Rd5 and the passed pawns are traded off--still a winning endgame for Black, but he has a simpler resource...} Rd4 {This forces White to exchange Rooks in order to stop Black from promoting. Once there are only Kings left, Black will have an easy time queening on one flank or the other.} 40. Rd5 Rxd5 41. exd5 d2 42. Kc2 Kf7 {Black leaves the WK tied down at the edge of the board while he mobilizes his own.} 43. Kxd2 Ke7 44. Kd3 Kd6 45. Kd4 {White has the opposition, but Black has a huge advantage--two connected, passed pawns just out of reach.} a5 46. f4 a4 47. h6 {Desperation sets in. Even if Black foolishly plays 47...gxh6, White still loses the race to promote: 48.f5 a3 49.f6 a2 50.a7 a1=Q+ and Black cleans up the game in short order.} g6 {0-1. It's over for White; he loses either the d- or f-pawn next turn (with 48.Kc3 or 48.f5 respectively), and Black's queenside pawns will tie up the White King with perfect immunity (if the King takes the rear pawn, he cannot catch the other one) while the BK escorts the g-pawn to the queening square. Thanks very much to sieni01 for the excellent game, and I hope you all enjoyed seeing it.
