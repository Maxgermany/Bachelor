[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Byrne (English) attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Sicilian Najdorf which is a very robust defensive system that is a very tough nut to crack. } 6. Be3 {The English-Bryne attack which is white's most active and most popular system against the Najdorf} Qc7 7. f3 {Defending e4 and preparing for a quick attack via g4-g5} e5 8. Nb3 {White is doing well so far he has a lead in development, a superior DSB and nice knights on the queen side. } Be6 {One of the nice features of the Najdorf is the simplicity of formation. Black aims to setup a flexible defensive structure with bishops on e7 and e6, knights on d7 and f6 and Queen on c7 with rooks on c8 and d8. After that he plans to play b7-b5-b4 or d6-d5 for counter play. } 9. g4 {Not everyone is a fan of this move as it is double edged. In the Sicilian, if you can not find the right balance between structure and activity you end up losing.  } h6 10. Qd2 {opens up queen side castling and supports further expansion via g4-g5. } Nbd7 {I do think Nc6 is better but Nbd7 does give black the option of placing a knight on b6 or c5. } 11. h4 {continuing with the simple plan of overrunning on kingside. } Be7 {develops a piece and prevents g4-g5. } 12. Rh2 {I suspect that black wants to play d5 so I prepare to make it easy to double rooks on the d-file. So when it does open the d-file is mine} O-O-O 13. O-O-O {I am now prepared for ...d5} d5 {As I expected!} 14. exd5 {Black can not capture the pawn because of the weak pawn on f7. Not only that, the deflection of the e-pawn away from the king side considerably weakens the advancing of the king pawns.  } Nf8 15. dxe6 Rxd2 16. Rhxd2 {double pad stack. White stands well here his king pawns are still in play, doubled rooks on the d-file and two open bishops! Theoretically black is already busted. } fxe6 {?! ...Nxe6 is met with the powerful 17.g5! I think conde7 had plans of attacking f3 via Rf8 and Qc6. } 17. Kb1 Ng6 {I think this is the decisive mistake as black thinks that attacking the h4 pawn is a good idea. Instead he pokes a sleeping bear.  } 18. g5 {! This liquidates the h4 weakness and creates a powerful g5 pawn. } hxg5 19. hxg5 {Black is forced to exchange knights and creates a two pawn wall in the center. However, the pawns are weak and are easy targets. for the rook and bishop pairs!} Nd5 20. Nxd5 exd5 21. Rd2xd5 Rh1 {only move as black can not allow the bishop pair to roam free as well} 22. Rd5d3 {Threatening Rc3} Kb8 23. a3 {limits the scope of black's bishop and creates an escape hatch. } Qc8 {The point of Kb8 besides side stepping the Rc3 is that black can now reroute his queen to the more central e6. } 24. Rc3 {I am in lawn cutting mode now! My aim is to take away as much of conde7's space as I can and squeeze him into undefendable position. } Qe6 {?! I would have played the more active 24...Qf5 hitting at f3} 25. Ka2 {I have a small problem that all my pieces are tied up doing something. The only useful move I have is this one which allows black to go on the offensive. } b5 {I like this move. } 26. Kb1 b4 27. Rcd3 Nf4 {forces the exchange of the bishop pair. } 28. Bxf4 exf4 {The exchange has one glaring defect for black. In that it opens the e-file!} 29. axb4 {A bit of a messy pawn structure but I am up a pawn! With complete control of the centre} Rg1 {Despite the messy pawn structure white's advantage is clear. } 30. Na5 {The only way to retain the pawn advantage. } Bxg5 31. Rd3d4 {Threatening Re4 to dominate the board. } Bf6 32. Re4 {I give up the pawn advantage for a even bigger plus-central dominance. Though in a few short moves I regain the pawn advantage. } Qf7 33. Nb3 Bh4 34. Nc5 Bf2 35. Nxa6+ {now I am winning. } Kb7 36. Nc5+ Bxc5 37. bxc5 Kc7 38. b4 {The storm is coming and black's remaining pieces are hopelessly out of place. } g5 39. Rde1 Kd8 40. Kb2 {The game ends as white has finally unpinned his bishop and will easily out match black. }
