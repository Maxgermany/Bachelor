[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 {A usual opening from my friend.} c6 {My reaction is Caro-Kann. I don't really know how to play it, or I can play it well, but I don't use this very often.} 2. Qf3 {Whoa! That made me a bit confused. Did he really want to win with Scholar's mate? Did he think it seriously?} e5 {Hm... I just didn't want him to play d4. In case he had just wanted to confuse me a move driving into Scholar's mate, but wanted to have his queen in the battlefield.} 3. Bc4 {Sholar's mate??? Are you serious??? :D} Nf6 {He can't play Qxf7# :D} 4. d3 {It was good to open the way for his DSB. If he plays Bg5, I will have doubled pawns. I must play something against it!} d5 {I played this in order to avoid having troubles with the f7 pawn.} 5. exd5 {He exchanges!} cxd5 {I complete the exchange, again attacking his bishop.} 6. Bb5+ {Now, he played this. I have some choices, but I chose to bring the knight out. In my opinion, it was a time losing move, he didn't develop any pieces, but I could, on the other hand, he didn't have any choices, just to save the bishop.} Nc6 {So, I blocked with the knight. Later on, it will turn out that it was a good choice.} 7. Qe2 {As you can see, my knight is pinned, so my e5 pawn has no defender.} Bd6 {Bd6 seemed to me the best to play.} 8. Bxc6+ {Now, he excanges, again.} bxc6 {Only option: I'm not in check, I have an e and a d pawn, both of them are defended, so I can say I control the centre.} 9. Bf4 {Now, my pawn is pinned! I cannot take his bishop. I ought to move something which defends my e5 pawn and also make an end of the pin.} Qe7 {I could easily play this, because he puts no pressure on my queenside and not either on my kingside. I don't have to take care of that.} 10. Nf3 {Blunder. This is why I wanted to make an end of the pin. I think he played this because he din't notice that the pin has been abolished.} exf4 {So, I took his bishop, and I also opened the e file. It's good for me because if he takes my queen, I can recapture withmy bishop (later on, I had te take care due to I had to keep my bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal), but if I manage to capture his queen, his only possible move to capture it with his king. And the a6-c8 diagonal is opened, that can be important, because if I move my bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, my pawn would be out of defender and that can elicit his king to capture it.} 11. Nd4 {It will make my job easier because of the undefended c6 pawn.} Bc5 {Just take my pawn, I am not defending it, free meat :D} 12. Nxc6 {Haha! You made a wrong move! } Qxe2+ {No, I didn't.} 13. Kxe2 {Only option.} O-O {Preparing Re8+} 14. d4 {Ahha!} Ba6+ {Yeey! Check!} 15. Kf3 {Here starts the big problem: Where can his king go if I defend the pawn on f4??? (After the game I told him that Kd1 may have been the best, or maybe Kd2 have been another better choice)} Bd6 {Of course, he should be annoyed from now. I also had a great plan, as it will turn out.} 16. Nc3 {Whuh! I will have some problems with my plan.} Rfe8 {If that knight weren't there...} 17. a3 {Tempo-losing move! If I had tried to take his knight with my DSB, my f4 pawn would become undefended, there wouldn't be mate for a long time.} Rac8 {Lose your knight, or lose the game! But he may not have realised the move Ne5. He would lose a pawn, but not a knight and not a game!} 18. Nxa7 {With this move he lost! He could save his knight, he could take a pawn of mine, but now...} Rxc3+ {He has no choice. bxc3} 19. bxc3 {Wh... Where is your knight? Nowhere? Run, bishop, run!} Be2# {And it's checkmate! Do you remember that I said I played correctly after 6. Bb5+ ??? If I had chosen the other way (Bd7), I wouldn't have this "bad" bishop which was the most useful piece! It made the king to move out to f3 by checking it, it took the e2 square when I defended the f4 pawn, and it's the bishop with which I gave my friend a checkmate! Please, rate my second (THIS!:D) annotation, and write comments. Thank you. }
