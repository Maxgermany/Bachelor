1. g3 {A surprise: Benko's opening. I didn't expect my opponent to play a rare opening, because it was a youth tournament and nearly everyone played 1.e4. The point of this opening move is to put the king's bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal, so it controls some key squares in the centre (e4 and d5). I didn't know the opening theory, so I decided to just follow the rules of the opening: put your pawns in the centre, develop as fast as possible and finally bring your king to safety. } e5 2. Bg2 d5 {Now I've built up a full pawn centre.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. O-O {?! Maybe he wanted to castle too soon... } Nf6 {Here I could have played 4...e4, forcing the knight to retreat to e1 as 5.Nh4?? loses a piece to 5...g5.} 5. Nc3 Bd6 {This is the novelty according to the GameKnot database. 5...Bb4 and 5...Be7 have been played before. This bishop looks a bit passive on d6.} 6. d4 {Finally also putting a pawn in the centre, so he can also develop his queen's bishop. } exd4 {Maybe 6...e4 was still better because my move gives White's bishop on g2 an open diagonal and his knight is better placed on d4 than it was on f3.} 7. Nxd4 Bd7 {?! White wants to open the centre with e4. Therefore, I have to castle as soon as possible so my king will not come under attack. Moreover, this bishop is a bit passive on d7. My coach suggests 7...O-O as an improvement, while the computer gives 7...Be5 (I don't like the computer's move since it would be the second move of that bishop in the opening while other pieces are still waiting to be developed).} 8. Nxc6 Bxc6 {?! This was why I wanted to put my bishop on d7. However, this loses a pawn. After 8...bxc6, 9.Nxd5?? is off course not possible because that just loses a piece. 8...bxc6 also opens the b-file for the rook on a8, which will compensate for the doubled pawns.} 9. Nxd5 O-O 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Bxc6 bxc6 {White has won a pawn in the opening and black has isolated doubled pawns on the c-file. However, these pawns can give him an open b-file and moreover Black is leading in development. Black is worse, but definitely not losing. } 12. Be3 {?! Developing, but removing the defence of the b2 pawn. Better was 12.c3 so the bishop doesn't have to defend the pawn and can develop next move. } Qxb2 13. Bd4 Qb4 {Better was 13...Qa3, preventing 14.Rb1? because of 14...Qxa2. } 14. e3 c5 {Chasing the bishop from its central square. } 15. Rb1 {Off course, 15...cxd4?? now loses to 16.Rxb4. I first have to move my queen. } Qc4 16. Bb2 Rad8 {I could have won the a2 pawn here (I just missed that). This is also not the best place for this rook. The f8 rook should go to d8 so the a8 rook can control the other open file (the b-file). } 17. Qf3 {?! Ignoring the hanging pawn on a2, removing the defence from the c2 pawn and losing a tempo (combined with the next move). } Qxc2 18. Qg4 {Threatening mate on g7. } g6 {More or less forced, the other option was 18...f6. } 19. Qh3 Rfe8 {A good move with multiple purposes. If now 20.Qh6, I can prevent the mate by putting my bishop on e5 (so the b2-bishop isn't attacking g7 anymore). Moreover, this rook is very well placed on the open e-file. But Fritz suggests 19...Rb8!, double-attacking the bishop on b2, which is actually even stronger. } 20. Qh6 Be5 {As I said before. } 21. Bxe5 {If he avoids the exchange, his bishop won't be on an active square. } Rxe5 {Here I offered a draw, although I knew my position was very pleasant. I was expecting some time trouble because I was a few minutes behind on the clock (I think I had 8 minutes left, against 15 for my opponent). } 22. Qf4 Red5 {Doubling the rooks. } 23. Qf3 Qxa2 24. Rba1 Qc4 25. e4 {?! Why not just take the pawn on a7? } Rd5d4 26. e5 Qd5 27. Qxd5 Rd8xd5 {With another draw offer, which was declined again. I was now really getting into time trouble, with less than 5 minutes left against some 13 minutes for my opponent. I didn't think I could win this with so little time on the clock. } 28. Rfe1 {Putting his rook behind the passed pawn. } Kg7 {After 28...c4, White has to watch out for the c-pawn. } 29. Rxa7 {This pawn was lost anyway. } c6 {? A mistaake, caused by time trouble. I should have defended this pawn (29...Rd7) instead of replacing it. Now the f7 pawn is pinned to the king on g7, so my opponent can play a nice move. } 30. e6 {! This was what I missed. } Kf8 {?? This move looks logical: I try to stop the pawn from promoting by going to e8 with my king. I knew that there would probably be a way to get my king off the e8 square, but I didn't see it yet. And indeed, it's the decisive error. Instead 30...Rd1! would have saved the game: 31.Rxf7+ Kg8 and the fight goes on.} 31. e7+ Ke8 32. Ra8+ Kd7 33. e8=Q+ Kd6 {? Missing mate in one. After 33...Kc7 it's mate in two: 34.Re7+ Kb6 35.Qb8#. } 34. Qd8# {And so I lost this hard-fought game in time trouble. I was a bit disappointed, off course, but I knew I had played well for the greatest part of the game. This is still one of my best games at this time control, but still there's a lot to learn for me.
