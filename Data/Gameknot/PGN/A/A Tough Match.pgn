[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 {My typical opening style. I find this to accomplish the same goals as a e4 or d4 opening, and it has been quite successful for me.} Nf6 2. g3 e6 3. Bg2 d5 4. Nf3 {Probably not best but I choose to develop rather than protect the pawn. Besides it is not like I cannot win the pawn back.} dxc4 5. Qa4+ {Again, I been told it is bad practice to bring the queen out this early, but I deemed the risk worth it.} c6 6. Qxc4 Bd6 7. O-O O-O 8. d4 b6 9. Qc2 h6 10. Nc3 Nbd7 {By this point, I feel White is slightly more developed and better protected. My pawn structure is stable, I have pieces influencing the center, and the King is protected. Very important points heading to the next game phase.} 11. Rd1 Qc7 12. e4 e5 {e5 is the only playable option I think to avoid the fork. Be7 does not really work because White can force more of Black's pieces from the center.} 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Nxe5 Bxe5 15. f4 {Weakening my king defense to make the bishop retreat} Bd6 16. h3 Bc5+ 17. Kh2 Nh7 {GK says this is a mistake and says Rd8 was better. I guess Black was still thinking about the threat of e5.} 18. Be3 {GK says b4 is better here, but I felt like I could win this exchange with a nice combination.} Bxe3 {Qe7 is a playable option for Black as well.} 19. Nd5 {Notice that Black cannot take the knight without losing the queen.} Qb8 20. Nxe3 Bb7 {I was expecting a c5 response here to open the line for the bishop and extend the chain on the queens side.} 21. Nf5 Nf6 22. e5 Nd5 23. Bxd5 {I been told that bishops are stronger than knights. However I feel as though this is a situation where the trade would benefit White more so than Black.} cxd5 24. Rac1 {Fully controlling the c-file. Notice that c8 cannot be used as a defense square due to the threat of a fork.} Qd8 25. Nd6 Qd7 26. Qc7 {At the time I felt the queen trade was necessary, but now I am not so sure. } Qxc7 27. Rxc7 Bc8 28. Rxd5 {GK says advancing the f-pawn is better. I thought about both options and had a hard time deciding which one was truly better. I did unnecessarily give up a pawn possibly explaining why I got a draw instead of a win. } Be6 29. Rd2 Bxa2 30. Nb5 a6 31. Nd6 g6 32. g4 a5 33. f5 Rad8 34. f6 Be6 35. Kg3 Rda8 36. Rb7 Rfb8 37. Re7 Rbd8 38. Rc2 {A draw is a fine result for such a strong player. I did not see a way to pull out the win so I agreed to a draw.}
