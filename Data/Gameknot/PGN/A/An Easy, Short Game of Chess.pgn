1. e4 {My opponent uses a popular opening: King's pawn opening.} e6 {I reply, almost mirroring my opponent.} 2. a4 {? This does nothing at all.} Bc5 {I open up my bishop quickly.} 3. Bc4 {He copies.} Qe7 {Now my queen, I see that my opponent is not very strong after a4, I attempt a fast checkmate.

Bb3 {He retreats.} Qh4+ {Now for the checkmate.} 10. Ke2 {He could of played g3 (mate in two) but he decides there's no point.} Qf2# {Checkmate. Too easy.}
