1. e4 d5 2. e5 Bf5 3. d4 e6 4. a3 c5 5. Be3 Qb6 6. Qc1 {Weird queen move... just to defend the pawn, but it's ok, b3 has its counters, too. } Nc6 7. dxc5 {A capture white should avoid. It frees black's position a lot, and loses a pawn.} Bxc5 8. Bxc5 Qxc5 {Now white cannot defend both c2 and e5.} 9. Nf3 {Black can explioit more the position, but it was complicated to figure out. So...} Qxc2 10. Qxc2 Bxc2 11. Nbd2 Nge7 12. Bb5 {Black should have avoided this move, with a6, since I was in no hurry to develop. But it was hard to see at a glance. } a6 {Silly. But I was hoping for the bishop to retire, so to put my knight on g6 and win the central pawn. } 13. Bxc6+ {Nxc6 was the right one, but it seemed sooo boring...} bxc6 {I thought I could get something advancing the free d pawn supported with the c one. But white wins a precious tempo using my bishop. } 14. O-O {The right one would have been Kd7, and leave the pawns advance for later. } O-O {Chess is tempo...} 15. Rfc1 Bd3 {Ba4 was deadly, of course. b3, and the bishop is lost. But now I lack a tempo to defend c6.} 16. Nd4 Rfc8 17. Rc3 Bb5 {I just didn't see a4 at once. The right one was c5, losing a pawn. } 18. Rac1 {Fortunately for me, my opponent didn't see it. } a5 {Only way to keep the pawn. } 19. b3 a4 {If followed by this one. It's amazing how cramped I became, in just two careless moves.  } 20. b4 {The situation on the queenside is controlled, for the moment. } Kf8 {Now, I have time to get my king where it belongs. } 21. Rc3c5 Ke8 22. Nxb5 cxb5 23. Rc5xc8+ Rxc8 24. Rxc8+ {White should have kept the pressure. Now, I win (?!)} Nxc8 {You see: I can attack the a3 pawn, and this is all that counts. Hard to believe, eh?} 25. Nf3 {Looking for b5, but it is less important than...} Nb6 26. Nd4 {Nc5, Nxb5, the king approaches and it is more or less the same. } Kd7 27. Nxb5 Nc4 {Now the knight is blocked defending a3, and nothing can prevent my king to approach.} 28. Nd6 Nxa3 {If b5, black can choose among f6 or even Nxb5, sac the knight. The white king cannot approach on time to avoid white to have to give back the knight for the pawn. But there is no need to do that.  } 29. Nxf7 Nb5 30. Nd6 Nxd6 31. exd6 a3 {Curtains. A surprising quick endgame. }
