1. e4 c5 {A mini-tournament game, I'm playing black and opt for the Sicilian. My third annotation today, in a row in fact, where I play the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Najdorf. Big surprise?} 6. Be3 e6 7. f3 b5 8. g4 h6 {Pawns, pawns, pawns.} 9. Qd2 b4 10. Nce2 e5 {The black pawn on b4 is en prise, but now white's knight on d4 is also en prise.} 11. Nb3 a5 12. Ng3 a4 13. Nc1 d5 {If anyone is counting, black has played 12 of his first 13 moves as pawn moves. Call Guiness, it might be some kind of record...} 14. Bb5+ Bd7 15. Bxd7+ Qxd7 16. exd5 Nxd5 {A couple exchanges liven things up a bit.} 17. Nd3 a3 {Black has moved those pawns this far...} 18. bxa3 Rxa3 {What an odd position. We're hardly out of the opening and black is already posting advanced rooks in enemy territory, before either side has even castled. Not that white's position looks to be a good candidate for castling...} 19. O-O Nc6 {... or, maybe it is a good candidate for castling after all.} 20. Bf2 Nc3 {To win the pawn on a2.} 21. Rfe1 f6 {To defend the pawn on e5.} 22. h3 Be7 {To shield the black king from the white rook, unpinning the pawn on e4, and to prepare to castle.} 23. Nf5 O-O 24. Nxe7+ Nxe7 25. Bc5 Rb8 {Defending the advanced, but isolated and weak black pawn on b4.} 26. Qf2 Ned5 {At this point I was beginning to feel like the position might be locking up. While black seems to have the better of it, there doesn't seem to be much he can do to further his positional advantage. That endangered pawn on a2 still looks like a target, but one black can take any time. Of course, if black captures on a2 right now, white will capture on b4, so first the defenses are secured.} 27. Kh1 Rb5 {To chase away the white bishop.} 28. Nb2 Qc6 29. Nd3 e4 {Look at what a mess this move makes. If white's knight retreats, the bishop on c4 falls. If white captures with 30. Rxe4?, black simply recaptures with 30. ... Nxe4 and gains the exchange for a pawn. This might be white's best alternative though.} 30. fxe4 Nxe4 {Now if 31. Rxe4?, then 31. Nc3 pins and wins the white rook on e4. A discovered pin (or at least the threat of one). Don't see many of those. Meanwhile, black's knight forks the white queen on f2 and bishop on c4.} 31. Qg2 Nxc5 {White saved his queen, preventing a discovered check from the black queen in the process, but now the white bishop falls. The cat's in the bag, and white chooses to resign.}
