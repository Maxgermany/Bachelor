1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 5. Nf3 c6 6. Be2 Nbd7 7. O-O Qc7 {If white Re1, o-o-o, all pretty normal so far. } 8. d4 {White's best move was Ng5, threatening NxB, weakening my pawns badly.} h6 9. Be3 g5 {First attacking move. White is not in a hurry.} 10. Ne5 {! A very nice trap! If NxN, dxN, Qxe5, Bd4 comes and I lose a piece! Spotted!} O-O-O {Now the NxN threat is very real.} 11. Nxd7 Rxd7 {Keeping the presure on the d column, preparing doubling Rs...} 12. Qe1 {"Just" getting away from the pin. Who would you prefer?} Bd6 13. g3 {Any pawn's move would have allowed a different plan of attack. It is not so simple to destroy that fortress, because if h5?, Bxg5!, so...} g4 {If white tries to free himself with f3, Re8 will punish him sooner or later. Anyway, a weakening I'm glad to provoke.} 14. Na4 {Nc5 does give him some counterplay, I estimated (against my standards! :-), so...} b6 {If Ba6+, I can even play Kb8 with no inmediate threat.} 15. Rd1 {He can push and sac the pawn for activity.} h5 {...I gave him the last chance to press me on the center. If I play any piece to d5, blocking his pawn, c4! will be bad for me, and NxBe3, fxN, opening for him the c column did not appeal me at all.} 16. c4 {Last chance, the storm is coming. But if he thinks, as I suspect, to play c5... } h4 {? White can still play Bg5 here. I would have gone for hxg3 anyway.} 17. d5 {The bad one. Even if more passive, c5 would have been better. I would have answered with Bxg3, but with no certain victory.} Bf5 18. dxc6 {? It just gives more action to my Q.} Qxc6 19. Nc3 {Wisely. I can play Ne4, threatening to exchange the N and play the deadly Be4-Bh1-Qg2# sequence...} h3 {...but this, even giving up the opening of the column, seems much quicker! Would white find a defence?} 20. f3 {My pawn is untouchable. He can play Rf7 now, and I need another attacker for the sac in g3.} Nh5 {This guy!} 21. Nb5 {? Ne4 could have been better.} Bxg3 {White is "tallishly" doomed, isn't he?} 22. Nxa7+ Rxa7 23. hxg3 {Last chance to go wrong: gxf3, Bxf3 and all my advantage vanishes. He thinks he's safe because of the Q, but...} h2+ {He should play Kh1, but I think Be4 wins: if fxB, Qxe+, Bf3, gxB. } 24. Kxh2 Nf4+ 25. Kg1 {Nh3+ just keeps the tension, but..} Qh6 {...and how can white escape the mate? Well, he can. } 26. Rd8+ Kxd8 27. Qd2+ Rd7 28. Bxb6+ Kc8 {If white now moves Be3 covering with the Q the mate in h2, Nh3+ wins the white Q. White resigned.}
