1. e3 {Hi. This is a game which i played with  black against only1soldier. at the end of this game i manage to turn a losing game into a draw with a radical decision. This is how it went down} e5 2. c3 d5 {Odd opening by white} 3. d4 e4 4. b3 Nf6 5. a4 a5 6. Ba3 Bxa3 {I decided to take because my dsb wasn't doing much.} 7. Nxa3 c6 8. h3 Be6 9. Nc2 Nbd7 10. b4 b6 11. b5 {Here he decides to kinnd of make his own lsb worse} c5 12. Ne2 cxd4 {i didnt mind whites knight on d4 because i would get a nice knight outpost myself also on e5 or c5} 13. Nexd4 Nc5 14. Nc6 {i really hadn't though about this move alot. here it starts to look a bit dangerous} Qc7 15. Nc2d4 Ng8 {Trying to reroute my knight to challenge the knight on c6} 16. Be2 Bd7 17. Bg4 Bxc6 {Here i though the knight was a bigger threat than the bishop and decided to take it instead} 18. bxc6 {Bad side of this was that it created a dangerous looking past pawn for white. good side is that its rather easy to get rid of considering all the pressure black can build up on it.} Ne7 19. Bd7+ {this just loses the pawn} Nxd7 20. cxd7+ Qxd7 21. Nb5 {this knight isn't really doing alot besides threatening a fork on c7 if my queen stops watching over it.} Rc8 {i decided to release my queen and watch over c7 with my rook} 22. O-O O-O 23. Qd4 {Nice central square for the queen, although its easy to harass} Rcb8 {I had to do something i hate, admit i made a mistake.} 24. Rfc1 Rfc8 25. c4 {Here black cant take the pawn because the pawn on d5 is pinned to the hanging queen} Nc6 {Black loses the pawn} 26. Qxd5 Qxd5 27. cxd5 Nb4 28. Rxc8+ Rxc8 {After a pair of rooks come off, the game starts to look a bit drawish, though white has a passed pawn on d5.} 29. d6 Rd8 30. Rd1 Kf8 {I decided that my king needs to step in and help deal with the pawn.} 31. Rd4 f5 32. Nc7 {this move threatens a nasty fork on e6 and so gains a tempo} Kf7 33. f3 Nc2 {Black wins a pawn here. Maybe white could have considered rd5 and after 35 g6 maybe 35... rb5 attacking the weak pawn on b6} 34. Rd2 Nxe3 35. fxe4 fxe4 {This crates a rather dangerous past pawn for black} 36. Re2 Nf5 {i though getting rid of our passed pawns would favor black considering his majority on the queen side} 37. Rxe4 Nxd6 38. Rf4+ Kg6 39. Rg4+ Kf7 40. Rf4+ {Here i offered a draw but white decided to continue on playing} Kg6 41. Ne6 Re8 42. Rg4+ {Apparently for a good reason. hes going to win the pawn on g7, while creating 2 dangerous looking pawns on h3 and g2.} Kf6 43. Nxg7 Rg8 44. Nh5+ Kf7 45. Rf4+ Ke7 46. Rf6 Nc4 {Here i noticed that ill lose the pawn on h7 anyway so i though ill try and get something back also} 47. Rh6 Ne3 {Perhaps the wrong move. Better would've probably been nb2} 48. Rxh7+ Kd6 49. Rh6+ Kc5 {White is just helping black to make his king more active while his king is still on the back row.} 50. g4 Kb4 51. Rxb6+ Kxa4 52. Rb7 Ka3 53. Rd7 {Threatening rd3+ winning the loose Knight on e3} Nc2 54. Nf6 Rc8 55. Nd5 a4 56. g5 Kb2 57. Nb6 {Here, i was getting a bit desperate. I decided to try a crazy idea and it turned out to be an amazing idea.} a3 {57.a3!! Its brilliant. it basically forces white to draw the game if he accepts the rook sac.} 58. Nxc8 {And he does!} a2 59. Rd1 Na3 {Preparing to block the rook off with Nb1} 60. Rd2+ Nc2 {Only move to hold the draw} 61. Rd1 Na3 62. Rd2+ Nc2 63. Rd1 Na3 64. Rd2+ Nc2 {And here the game was drawn by threefold repetition. I got rather excited after i realized my idea of saccing the rook had worked. Hope you enjoyed:)}
