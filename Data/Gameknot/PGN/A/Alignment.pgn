[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D04)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 Nc6 4. Bd3 {Looks like white is getting ready to castle early.} Bg4 {Black sees an opportunity to pin the knight.} 5. Nbd2 Qd6 {The intent here is to push the e pawn forward until it can fork white's bishop and knight. With the knight pinned, the fork can prove quite devastating.} 6. b3 e5 {If white takes with the d4 pawn, then black takes back with the c6 knight - again forking white's bishop and knight.} 7. Bb2 e4 {The fork is in place.} 8. h3 {White tries to scare the bishop away.} Bxf3 {White just takes the knight anyway.} 9. gxf3 exd3 {And the white grabs the bishop.} 10. cxd3 O-O-O 11. Qc2 Nd7 12. O-O-O g6 {Push pawn to allow the bishop to develop.} 13. Kb1 Nb6 {Since white castled on the queenside and to avoid the block of white pawns in the center, black brings minor pieces over to the queenside.} 14. e4 Bg7 {Black decides not to exchange pawns in the middle. If an exchange happens, let white do it. That would triple-up the white pawns and make them an easy target later in the game. If black exchanged, then white could undouble the pawns on the d file and open the main diagonal for white's bishop. It's better to let white do the exchange.} 15. e5 {But white is not interested in the exchange but in blocking black's bishop and in pushing the queen out of the d6 square.} Qe6 16. a4 {I see this move as weak. It leaves the b3 pawn more vulnerable. A queen and knight are looking after it right now, but if those two pieces are captured or forced to move, then the pawn in front of the king is left unprotected.} f6 {Time to disrupt white's pawn line along the main diagonal.} 17. f4 {And white brings in reinforcements.} fxe5 18. fxe5 Rhf8 {Black moves to take the unprotected f2 pawn - and move the rook to where it can later threaten the poorly supported d4 pawn.} 19. Rh2 Rf4 20. Qc5 {White brings queen to protect the d4 pawn.} Bf8 21. Qc1 {Queen retreats for safety and the d4 pawn is at the mercy of the c6 knight.} Nxd4 22. Bxd4 Rxd4 {From here, black can threaten two more pawns.} 23. f4 {That was a blunder. White just offers up a pawn for free.} Rxf4 24. Nf1 {Maybe not for free since now the queen has her sights on the rook.} Qxe5 25. Rc2 Rd7 {White moves to threaten the king and black moves to protect. I had considered moving the bishop to g7 in order to threaten mate along the main diagonal, but I would not be able to do that if white checked the king with a rook on c7.} 26. Nh2 Bg7 {Now the mate threat becomes obvious.} 27. Ra2 {White moves to protect the a1 square from the black queen.} Rf2 {Black's rook moves in as an apparent sacrifice. If white's rook takes the black rook then checkmate follows in one move. White could move the d1 rook to d2, but black would exchange in response.} 28. Rxf2 Qa1+ {Check but not quite mate. The king can escape to c2.} 29. Kc2 Qa2+ 30. Qb2 {White's only move is to block with the queen.} Qxb2# {And then checkmate!}
