1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 Nh5 {Strange. I am used to play with the dsb exchanged with this N. Bg5, h6, Bh4, is not an option, if black really wants to exchange the B. Bd2 would be entering a scheme that I don't know well, so...} 3. Bg3 {Go for it! Come on!} Nxg3 4. hxg3 g6 {I am used to play c3 against the fianchetto. } 5. e4 Bg7 6. Nf3 {Developing pieces is better, and the N is not pinned. } d6 7. Nbd2 {in order to be able to play c3. Ng5, threatening Rxa7 is a "naive" plan that is easily countered by h6 and h5.} Bg4 8. c3 {The N is still pinned, but black has nothing.} Nd7 {Here, I } 9. Bd3 {? Losing an important Bc4, pressuring f7, which can be important later. } c5 {Black's best move in all lines. I can block the position with d5, conceding e5 to the black N, or...} 10. Rh4 {Threat the B. Just a crazy move, because of the logical answer...} h5 {...which, in return, weakens g6. Now, Qc2 made for a e5-Bxg6 trhust, but I didn't spot it at the right moment. I just saw my N jumping to g4, and now, if f6, Ne6!} 11. Bc4 {Pressure on the diag with the weakest piece. Be careful with the black N in d7 (it can ride to b6, threatening the B to exchange.)} cxd4 {!? Black is right. Among all the attack, I lost te eye on the defence. Any move I do leads to another threat, unless I threat first...} 12. Qb3 {...defending c3. True is that black can play dxc3, Bxf7+, Kc8, and white has to take good care of the black's pawn, or cxb2... a tactic mess!} O-O {This fortifies f7 but leaves e6 in reach of a white pesky N (now unpinned, thanks to the Q's movement).} 13. Ng5 {This move makes several threats. Look at black's f7, and where the lsb will go after f3...} e6 {At this point, now I realize, I have in my hands the B g4 with f3. } 14. Rxg4 {I sac the exchange thinking that I will recover it, but I was wrong. } hxg4 15. Nxf7 {?? Bxd6 was the right move. If fxe6, Nxe6, forking Q and R and threatening to take with check. I just blundered here!} Nc5 {Black comes on with this coup-de-scene! I just tried to calculate the lines here, but when I realized that I will lose material, I felt that I had to go for the exchange. } 16. Nxd8 {When NxQ, I won't be able to save the N because of the white's threat NxRa1, but I would have had Bxe6 - an important pawn. } Nxb3 17. Bxe6+ {It's a pity I can't have the N here, but then there is g4 awaiting me. } Kh7 {I was worried about c3, but now I have to take the N, no way. How? a2, N or B? The threat is dxc3, and I can't retake without having the black B on c3, which should be avoided. } 18. Nxb3 {?? the worst way. This N is going nowhere, and kind of "forces" black's dxc3. I can't retake, of course, or Bxc3+ forking the R, BUT I have a tempo that means a N for me, (Nxb7 or Nf7 are possible). And the g4 pawn, of course! Was it enough for you? Well, if so, I'll wait to show you another thing about the position. } Raxd8 {This was the bad part of Nxb3: if axb3, a7 would have been threatened, and black must have used the other R instead. } 19. Nxd4 {...but the N costed black all the threats he had on c3! Dear reader: was black right, of could he have broken my defences and won somewhere?} Rde8 {Good move. My B can't leave the e4 pawn unprotected by any means. If Bxg4?? Rxe4+ and a minor piece is gone. } 20. Bd5 {Fortunately, this is a very nice post, that will force black to sac a R to do some progress..} Re7 {Defending b7, of course. Now, Ng5! wins anothe pawn, while white has no weaknesses.} 21. Ke2 {This move heads for Rh1. I preferred it to any other because of Bh6+, which would have lost all the open column advantage. I am an exchange for two pawns down. I have to play aggressively. } Rfe8 {I could have defended this with f3, but I felt that I wanted black to return me the exchange for a pawn. } 22. Rh1+ {...for this. } Bh6 {Now the Bh6 is pinned. } 23. Nb5 {Threatening two distant pawns (the move I missed before), kind of forcing...} Re7xe4+ 24. Bxe4 Rxe4+ {Now the fork is still active.Black can defend with Ra4, a3, Ra6. } 25. Kd3 {I would suggest d5 to black, but Nc7...} Re6 {Overseeing or desestimating Ra4. } 26. Nxa7 {From its current position, the BR can't threat my N.} Kg7 {Freeing the B from the pin. Sensible. } 27. Rh4 {Black can't save this pawn, but...} Rf6 {This won't stop my threat, so I just have to defend.} 28. Ke2 Bc1 {Another counterattack, my threat on g4 is still "on".} 29. b3 Bb2 30. c4 {ok, now what? d5?} Bd4 {OUCH! :-) Well, I have to minimize the damage.} 31. Nb5 Bxf2 {If Rxf2+, Kd3, threatening the B. g4 is lost, and g3 is defended!} 32. Rxg4 Bg1 {Now it's a matter of technique! How to proceed?} 33. Rf4 {Exchanging R's will undouble my pawns, and left b and d pawns weak. I'm not sure.} Re6+ {Embarassing. } 34. Kd1 {The only "free of danger" square I found. } Bc5 {? A bad plan, because black wouldn't be able to hold the B in this position!} 35. a3 Re3 {One or two of my pawns will fall, but...} 36. b4 {He has to save the B first. White e6 is untouchable (Rd3+ will win it). } Rxg3 {?? Either black blundered or he tried to think in conceding a piece for pawn, this was a blunder and the game loses insterest. Still something about the win: } 37. bxc5 dxc5 {...otherwise, the white's d pawn will become very strong. } 38. Rf2 {Now, I will demostrate black he has nothing to do, and he will resign. } Rg4 39. Rc2 {Black has nothing. } Kf6 40. Nd6 b6 41. Nc8 Rg3 {I can exchange pawns, but I preferred...} 42. a4 {Nxb6 will defend both pawns. } Rb3 {The other way to threat b6 is with the R.} 43. Rd2 {If the BR moves from b, I'll take the pawn. } Ke5 44. Rd6 {b6 is lost.} Rg3 45. Rxb6 Rxg2 46. a5 {.,, and now, this little soldier threats heavily to win.} Kd4 {Good of bad? Black has a last resource in mind, I overlooked to.} 47. a6 Kd3 {Mate threat!} 48. Re6 Kxc4 {Now I am two pawns down, and he can sac one of them for my N... a drawn is still possible! Or not? Here it comes the last strike:} 49. a7 Ra2 50. a8=Q {! Can you see why?} Rxa8 51. Nb6+ {...and the game is definitely lost for black! Thank you for reading and sorry for the bad quality of game and comments! Feel free to correct me, I will appreciate it!}
