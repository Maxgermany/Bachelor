1. d3 {I don't suppose this happens with actual, physical pieces. This was a mouse slip. I intended to play d4.} b6 2. e4 {This should reveal how narrow my book knowledge is. I'm going purely on whatever general precepts there are. Here, I'm just trying to control as much of the center as possible. My opponent, I imagine, was suspicious of d3 and was playing it coy.} Bb7 3. Nc3 c6 {This is a terrible move, any way you cut it. The game is won for me here.} 4. f4 e6 5. Be3 d5 6. exd5 exd5 7. Nce2 {This is a blitz game, and I clearly didn't want to be skewered by the d pawn's advance. But Qe2 is surely stronger for me.} Be7 8. Qd2 Nf6 9. O-O-O O-O 10. Nf3 Nbd7 11. Ng3 h6 12. h4 c5 13. Ne5 Nxe5 14. fxe5 Nd7 15. Bxh6 gxh6 16. Qxh6 Nxe5 17. Nf5 Bf6 18. g4 Nxg4 {A very tempting move is an obvious blunder.} 19. Rg1 {Doh.} Bg7 {And to make matters worse....} 20. Qxg7# {}
