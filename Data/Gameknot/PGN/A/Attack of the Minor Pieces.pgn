[Opening "English (A30), symmetrical variation"]

1. c4 {Hey all! This game is from a GK tournament a couple months ago (94th tournament, expert section, round two). I thought it was a very interesting game that shows the sheer power of an early space advantage. Enjoy!} c5 {Symmetrical English, probably my least comfortable variation.} 2. g3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e6 4. Bg2 Nf6 {Both sides strongly contest d5.} 5. Nf3 {An alternative is 5.e4, cementing a bind on d5. I choose a more reserved approach, though.} Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 {d2-d3 is also possible, but I prefer to create a little tension to liven the game up.} cxd4 {Not really necessary, I think. White wouldn't play dxc5 anytime soon, so this capture really just elevates the White Knight and lets the Bishop free on the long diagonal again. I think 7...d5 would have been interesting.} 8. Nxd4 a6 9. b3 {Reinforcing the c-pawn and preparing to fianchetto if need be.} h6 {Practically forcing White's next move.} 10. Bb2 {This is now the best place for the Bishop, though possibilities of sacrificial tactics on h6 later on do exist.} Qc7 {Likewise, this is probably the best place for the Queen in the long run, but now she can't support a d5 push, which I think should have happened by now to free up Black's game.} 11. e4 {White takes the moment to shut down d5 for the forseeable future. There's no clear way to break through, but White's space advantage is getting more pronounced.} Ne5 {I think ...Nb4 is sassier, though the text does give Black the opportunity to transfer the Knight to the kingside if he chooses.} 12. f4 {?! This is pretty dangerous with the Black dark-square Bishop still in play, but White has completed his core development and now seeks to occupy space and restrict his opponent's play as much as possible.} Nc6 {Black now has to prove that the weakness he induced in White's kingside was worth conceding the center.} 13. Na4 {White prevents ...Bc5, which could cause trouble by pinning the Knight, and sets his eye on the weak b6 square.} Nxd4 {I'm not a big fan of this move. It eliminates White's central Knight, but Black's position is very cramped and he cannot replace the developed piece as easily as White can.} 14. Bxd4 d6 {Finally releasing the LSB, fourteen moves into the game. By playing this move rather than ...b5, Black also signals a change in direction: he will now break on e5 rather than d5, giving him some much-needed space.} 15. Kh1 {I strongly considered 15.e5! here, and I think it may well be stronger than the text. It creates a weakness on f5 and a potential one on d5, but it also further compresses the Black forces, especially the LSB. The main reasons I decided against it were the light-squared weaknesses it creates and the fact that it drives the Black Knight to d7, from which it can defend b6 (and indeed has little else to do). The text move has the advantage of completely forestalling any aggression against the White King for the foreseeable future.} e5 {Black finally breaks, but I don't know that this is the right time. His d-pawn is now horribly backwards and an easy target for the White forces. Perhaps 15...Rb8 followed by ...b5 would have been stronger.} 16. Bb6 {Blocking the b7 pawn, getting the Bishop out of harm's way, and harassing the BQ. Any time you can respond to a threat at the same time as you create one of your own, it's a gain of tempo.} Qc6 {Here Black does the same thing: the BQ is no longer threatened and White's e-pawn is now hanging.} 17. Qe2 {Probably 17.Qc2 was better, but the text shows that the WQ is headed for e3, to provide support for the f-pawn.} Bg4 {Of course.} 18. Qe3 Nd7 {Threatening the Bb6 as well as a possible ...f5, as well as setting up a rather complex combination. What started out as a somewhat flavorless game is only going to get more twisted from here on out.} 19. Rac1 {White lines up on the c-file with the BQ, getting his Rook out of the corner, and inviting Black's next move, for better or for worse...} exf4 {Black tears the game wide open. Now White either sacrifices the integrity of his kingside even further with 20.gxf4, or accepts an isolated d-pawn and the loss of an exchange by retaking some other way. Take a broad look at the position here: White has a definite spatial advantage but Black should have decent counterplay against the White King. Remember this feeling for a few moves.} 20. Rxf4 {??! I looked at this move for a long time trying to work out all the variations, and then decided to simply go for it. Take a few minutes reviewing this position: White is sacrificing material for positional gains, in theory, but the situation is very complex. The main things to notice are: Black has a three-piece shishkabob lined up for him along the c1-g5 diagonal; White has a discovered attack ready to go against the Black Queen, and Black's LSB is unguarded. What happens now?} Bg5 {I actually think 20...Bh5 was better. Since White has three major pieces on the vulnerable diagonal, Black can win an exchange even if he plays ...Bg5 a move later. So, he might as well get his LSB to safety.} 21. e5 {White unleashes an attack on the BQ. Note that Black could delay his response to it with 21...Bxf4 22.Qxf4 Qc8, since White would be unwise to attempt to double-down: 21...Bxf4 22.Bxc6?? Bxe3 23.Bxb7 Bxc1 24.Bxa8 Rxa8 25.exd6 leaves White with far too little for his material.} Qc8 {The only safe square! Suddenly b7 looks vulnerable, and d6 is undefended.} 22. exd6 {White ties up a loose end and gives himself a powerful pawn spike in Black's territory.} Re8 {! Gaining a tempo to reposition the Rook.} 23. Qd4 {White's Queen must not stop defending f4.} Bxf4 24. Qxf4 {Remember how you felt a few moves ago, that White had a small spatial advantage but Black should have counterplay? Compare that with the position now. White has only a Bishop and a pawn for his Rook, but his positional advantages are now huge.} Ne5 {Black brings his Knight up to a more useful position and defends his LSB--guarding the critical d1 square. Of course ...Nxb6 wouldn't get anything useful done, since it just invites White to fork the Black Queen and Rook.} 25. Bd5 {White can't get his Rook on the d-file easily, so he picks an easier target: f7. First he pins the pawn so it can't escape.} Bh5 26. Rf1 {Not yet an overwhelming attack, but White is keeping the initiative by forcing Black to defend himself.} Qg4 {!? I think this might be Black's best shot in the position. White has a massive attack rolling down the board, spearheaded by the passed d-pawn. A Queen exchange could lessen Black's defensive burdens. However, he does give up another pawn, making White's center that much stronger...} 27. Bxb7 {! Of course there's no reason to take the Queen right away.} Rab8 {The only safe square!} 28. Bd5 {I strongly considered the riskier 28.Nc5, with the idea of following it up with Bc7 to win back an exchange and probably the game. The problem is that 28...Nd3! seems to me almost equal for Black.} Qxf4 {Black takes the initiative while he has a chance.} 29. Rxf4 Nd3 {This is a great spot: White's Knight is largely cut off from the world and cannot jump to c5 to support a d6-d7 advance. Black's problem is that he has only Rooks to defend the storm of pawns and minor pieces pressing down on him.} 30. Rf1 {This seems best, to prevent checking tactics on the back rank with which Black could equalize.} Ne5 {Unfortunately for Black, this is probably his only good move. He cannot stay on d3, much as he might like to, because he has no way at all to defend d7 thanks to White's powerful Bishops. } 31. Bc7 {The beginning of the end. Of course Black's Rook can't flee to c8, because then Bb7 wins it.} Rb4 32. Nc5 {! The White Knight makes his triumphant return, and what a return it is. Not only does he now threaten to win the Black Rb4 (and Black is powerless to stop it without losing *some* material), but he also threatens to simply push through with his passed d-pawn. Black cannot meet all the threats posed by the swarm of White minor pieces, and the pawn they escort.} Ng4 {This is a last-ditch effort to distract White from his goals: Black threatend ...Ne3 with a fork, but White has other plans.} 33. d7 {1-0. Black's threats hold no weight; his pieces are uncoordinated and he's about to lose at least a Rook, so he resigns, and rightly so. Many thanks to mgwili for a fantastic game! Any comments anyone has on this game, or on my analysis, would be greatly appreciated. I'm sure I've missed things in my analysis and I'd very much like to know what those things are. I hope you enjoyed, and thanks for reading!}
