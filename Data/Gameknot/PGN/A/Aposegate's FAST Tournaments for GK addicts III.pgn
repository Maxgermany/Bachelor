1. e4 {he opens the way i usually do} e5 {so i naturally match} 2. Bc4 {nothing surprising} Nc6 {defend the pawn and get the knight out} 3. Nc3 {the same} Bc5 {we're mirroring each other fine for now} 4. Nd5 {there's a more daring move. no immediate attack but it does trap my queen till i can either get rid of that knight or castle, otherwise he'll have a king/rook forked check} Nf6 {so i set up a sacrifice} 5. f4 {that complicates matters quite a bit, plenty of options here} Nxe4 {he probably expected me to either take f4 or trade the knights, this move obviously threw him for a bit of a loop, and his obvious next move might be to take e5 and trade pawns, but that would clearly give me a positional advantage with my two knights controlling the middle and my king still ready to castle} 6. Ne3 {the alternatives might not have been pretty, but i don't get this move at all. i would've guessed d2 to d3 to chase off my knight and delay the pawn exchange} exf4 {instead, i take his pawn, and now he's moved his knight right into its attack path so he's going to have to waste another move defending it} 7. d4 {now he finally moves that d pawn, but this still doesn't make much sense, as my bishop is obviously not in real danger here and that d pawn is now doomed - it does force me to delay taking his knight though} Nxd4 {so i take the pawn, and i'm back out of danger} 8. Nf3 {not bad, he's setting up a lot of options here. if i just take the knight at e3, he takes the one at d4 and he'll have the definite positional advantage. if i instead take the knight at f3, that enables his queen to come into play pretty decisively and make a real mess of things over there. so time for creative thinking} Nd6 {so that's creative thinking, and not looking so hot now that i see it - no better than the other options already mentioned. now this is basically just looking like a mess of piece exchanges} 9. Nxd4 {and it begins} Bxd4 {now this was kind of silly - it would seem to be exchanging my knight and bishop for just his knight. i clearly should have sent the knight at d6 to take the bishop at c4, and then there'd at least be an even exchange. as it is, it would seem like i'd only come even out of this because i'd already decimated a bunch of his pawns} 10. O-O {but, much to my surprise, he doesn't take the ridiculous bait and castles instead, leaving me some room to redeem myself} fxe3 {i decide i might as well see what i can get here. again, a bad move. i should have used the bishop to take the knight, putting his king in check and thereby assuring that he'd have to trade his bishop for mine, so i'd get a bishop & a knight for just one bishop. a couple of big tactical errors early on here, and the middle of the board is almost cleared out already. } 11. Qxd4 {so now his queen wakes up and, delayed, takes the bishop} O-O {time to get my king to relative safety before it's too late, but white has a massive position of power at this point and it's starting to look like i'm screwed} 12. Bxe3 {yup, there goes that floating, lonely pawn, and white's position is looking better and better, while almost all my living pieces are trapped back row} b6 {my first step to correct that, creating an alley for the bishop to attack through} 13. Rf3 {he's clearly moving the rook out for the mate, while i'm still mostly trapped. i can't even move my knight anywhere without getting him killed} Bb7 {seemingly innocuous, but this is the crucial move as it turns out. protects my rook, attacks his rook, and sets up future assaults on the white king} 14. Rg3 {there's the mate attempt, of course} Nf5 {fortunately, this move frees up my knight, finally, attacking simultaneously all 4 points of interest on the enemy side -- the three attackers and the spot they're all gunning for.} 15. Rxg7+ {white decides to sacrifice his rook in the interest of clearly up the opening} Nxg7 {and there's nothing i can do but grab him, although things are still looking pretty grim for poor old black} 16. Bh6 {and even more so now - move and he's got my rook, stay and he's got mate} Nf5 {so of course i move, basically the only viable option there or it would've all been over} 17. Qg4+ {but he's got a great move, really devastating} Kh8 {my only option is to tuck up in the corner and hide, and i'm feeling really penned in now} 18. Bxf8 {he grabs the rook as predicted, and there's not much to do but take his bishop and sacrifice the knight. if i move the knight instead, he's got mate, and this is a very precarious balance} Qxf8 {so there's my only real option, eliminating the mate threat for the moment} 19. Qxf5 {but the exchange wasn't too fair and i say goodbye to my knight, which served me well. still, his attack seems to have faltered at this point - he drove on aggressively, boldly, sacrificing a lot, but things have wound up pretty even. he seems to have given up a massive positional advantage here and we're back to an even fight} Qg7 {it looks to him, i assume, like i'm setting up to attack that b2 pawn and make a play on his second rook, but does anybody else remember that little bishop hiding out at b7? i do, but obviously he doesn't} 20. Bd3 {even if he missed the obvious mate, this is puzzling, the best he could hope for here is to exchange his queen and bishop for my queen, thus turning his former advantage into a disadvantage -- i guess he figured i'd be stupid enough to go off chasing his b2 pawn and the rook in the back, and leave him to mate me on the next turn} Qxg2# {no such luck, though, and the bishop tucked in the corner proves its decisive power, as i pull out a rough victory from what seemed like certain defeat}
