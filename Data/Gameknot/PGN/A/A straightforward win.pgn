[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. h3 {One of those "offrecords" moves that gives me a good game, if I don't play it against high rated opponents (HRO :-)} e6 {Stronger, IMO, is to get the dsb out of the pawn chain, with Bf5. It gives a ready-made pawn storm for white, but manageable. } 5. e3 {Tempting black to Bb4+, which is bad for him.} Be7 6. c3 {A kind of a loss of tempo. Indicated was Nd2 or Bd3, or even g5 (with g5 in mind, after Ne5).} O-O {Just what black should be aware to avoid. Better for black is to castle queenside. } 7. Bd3 {Preparing. } b6 {A logical outcome, but black isn't aware he must take care of his kingside urgently... already. } 8. g4 Nd7 9. h4 e5 {This is made to free a little black's lsb. Black realizes what's coming on, and tries to mix up things a little. } 10. dxe5 Re8 {Too slow, but the idea is not bad. My king is still far from the safety of the queenside. } 11. Qc2 g6 12. h5 {Now, the white bishop plans to be sacrificated in g6.} Nc5 {Trying to get rid of it. } 13. hxg6 Nxd3+ {Right, in a way. } 14. Qxd3 {But the queen is no less threat. Black, nevertheless, correctly calculates that} fxg6 15. Nbd2 {Without the other rook, white's attack is stalled. } a5 {This is "the" mistake: black tries to get an attack on his own on the queenside, but doesn't see his kingside is still in danger. Apparently, black thinks that the g pawn is poisoned... and he's right. } 16. O-O-O Ba6 17. Qc2 {No problem, folks. } Bb5 {Purposeless move, I fear. Black trusts the kingside lock, but...} 18. Rxh7 Kxh7 19. Rh1+ Kg7 20. Rh6 {...not Bh6+. My aim is to get the queen into the fray, and this is unstoppable. Maybe Rg8, but then Rxg6+, Kf8, Qf5+. Black resigns.}
