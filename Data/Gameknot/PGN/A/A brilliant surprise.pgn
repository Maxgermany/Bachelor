1. d4 {Wanting to slow the game down.} Nf6 {The young lady has been brushing up on her game and is confident enough to try a non-Classical line.} 2. c4 {Natrural.} e6 {Heading for...} 3. Nc3 {..after this move...} Bb4 {...a Nimzo-Indian.} 4. Qb3 {Aggresive play. 4 Q-B2 also guards the N but doesn't put the B en prise.} Nc6 {Guarding.} 5. e3 {Opening the line for the KB to guard the QBP.} d5 {Challenging the center.} 6. c5 {6 N-B3 was the right move. Now White falls behind in development.} e5 {The girl smartly opens up the board with this temporary sacrifice.} 7. dxe5 {Her boyfriend takes up the challenge.} Ne4 {Adding pressure to the pinned Knight.} 8. Bb5 {White goes in for the counterpin.} Nxc5 {Winning back the material and provoking White into a fatal trap.} 9. Qxb4 {White *thinks* he has just won a piece. Obviously NxQ is impossible, as the Knight is pinned to the King... right?} Nd3+ {Brilliant! The pin vanishes like smoke in a sirocco wind!} 10. Bxd3 {Forced...} Nxb4 {...but now the Queen falls. White had the dignity to resign and congratulate his girlfriend on her brilliant play.}
