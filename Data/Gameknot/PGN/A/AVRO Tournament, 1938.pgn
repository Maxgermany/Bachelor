1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {To allow in the simplest manner the support of the Pawn skeleton by P-QB3.} Nf6 {Permitting White his intended development. 3... P-QB4 provides much more resistance.} 4. e5 Nfd7 5. Bd3 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ne2 Qb6 8. Nf3 {Black must now decide on a course of action. } cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf1 {An example of Alekhine's blending of Classical and Hypermodern ideas. The Classical school did not like foregoing castling in this manner, but they did believe in denying exchanges to the more cramped opponent. Alekhine prefers the second consideration.} Be7 11. a3 Nf8 {Castling would invite an immediate attack by P-KR4, where White would develop threats faster than Black could summon defenses to meet them.} 12. b4 Bd7 13. Be3 Nd8 {If 13... N-N3, 14 P-KR4 at once enforces a retreat or a weakness.} 14. Nc3 a5 15. Na4 Qa7 16. b5 {After this move the whole of Black's Q side is tied up.} b6 {Denying White the outpost square on QB5.} 17. g3 f5 18. Kg2 Nf7 19. Qd2 h6 {Starting a fight for the black squares on the K side, but the weakening of the white squares offers White an alternative target.} 20. h4 Nh7 21. h5 {Giving up control of KN5 to Black to secure KN6 for himself. Black cannot make full use of the black squares, however, as ...P-N4 would be answered with PxP e.p.} Nfg5 22. Nh4 Ne4 23. Qb2 {Persistently denying exchanges to a cramped opponent. 23... BxN is not feasible, as after 24 PxB Black's advanced Knight is trapped and won by 25 P-B3.} Kf7 24. f3 Neg5 25. g4 {White begins to strengthen his operations on the white squares.} fxg4 26. Bg6+ Kg8 27. f4 Nf3 {If 27... N-K5, 28 BxN PxB 29 N-N6 wins the Exchange.} 28. Bxh7+ Rxh7 {If instead KxB, 29 Q-B2 ch K-N1 30 N-N6 wins the Exchange.} 29. Ng6 Bd8 30. Rac1 Be8 31. Kg3 {Now the material begins to fall, first the KNP and then the Knight which has no escape.} Qf7 32. Kxg4 Nh4 33. Nxh4 Qxh5+ 34. Kg3 Qf7 35. Nf3 {Black lost on time, but he has no compensation for the lost material, and White threatens Q-QB2 followed by N-N5.}
