[White "maglicianer (1495)"]
[Black "lord_shiva (1663)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B33), Pelikan, Bird variation"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian Defense.  I chose this opening because a quick review of Maglicianer's games showed she tended to lose more often with this.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {I chose Nf6 because every move made by white except NC3 favors black in the database.} 5. Nc3 {Naturally white plays NC3.  Pelikan variation.} e5 6. Ndb5 Nxe4 {This was an early morning blunder.  For some reason I thought I could answer 7 NxNe4 with Qa5+, and then QxNb5--completely overlooking the fact Nb5 was defended by Bf1.  I even programmed it.} 7. Nxe4 Qa5+ 8. c3 {Now I notice Bf1.  (At least I didn't program THAT!)} a6 {Pushing the knight is pretty weak when white WANTS to play Nd6+.  But white might be better off playing 9 Pb4.  The black queen is all that is protecting against the infamous Nc7+ rook fork.  Black could respond with Qb6, but white would answer with Be3, forcing the black queen back to Qd8.} 9. Nbd6+ {If black plays Kd8 white answers NxPf7+ and forks the h rook.} Bxd6 10. Nxd6+ {Now the king must move.  Kf8 blocks the h rook.} Ke7 11. Nf5+ Kf6 12. Bd3 d5 13. O-O Bxf5 14. Bxf5 Kxf5 15. Qf3+ Ke6 16. Qg4+ f5 17. Qxg7 h5 18. Qg6+ Kd7 19. Qxf5+ Kd6 20. Qg6+ Kc7 21. Qg7+ Kd6 22. Qg6+ Kc7 23. Qg7+ {}
