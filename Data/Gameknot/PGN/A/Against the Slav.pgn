1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 {Unfortunately he plays the Slav. I never was very good against it because I hadn't yet learned about it in my 1. d4 opening book. } 3. Nf3 Nf6 {Standard of the Slav } 4. Bg5 {I got this idea from a friend of mine while analysing one of his games. He continuously pinned his opponent's bishops which led him to a good game and a win. } Bf5 {"Good developmental move. Takes control of the b1-h7 diagonal and prepares to play e6." } 5. e3 e6 6. a3 {Aimed at preventing Bb4+ and the possible pins he could put on my pieces. } Qa5+ {A move that sets a trap for white. If b4 then Bxb4+ and white cannot take back with the a pawn because of the unprotected a1 rook. } 7. Qd2 Qxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 Be7 9. Be2 Nbd7 10. O-O O-O 11. c5 h6 12. Bh4 Rfe8 { Planning for a future e5. } 13. Bg3 {Protecting the e5 square and taking control of the h2-b8 diagonal. Now white has control of the dark squares. } Bg4 {In my opinion this is not a great move because although it pins the white knight and threatens to exchange the ""bad"" bishop, it had a nice position of f5 and now the white bishop can be developed to d3." } 14. Bd3 b6 {Attempting to break through on the queenside and create a weak c5 pawn. } 15. b4 a5 16. b5 { This is the key move because it allows the bishop to be developed to a nice square. } cxb5 17. Bxb5 {According to Chess King, c6 followed by Bxb5 is better.  } bxc5 18. Ne5 {Utilizing the pin on the knight and the attack on black's light squared bishop.  } Red8 19. Bxd7 Bd6 20. Nxg4 Bxg3 21. Nxf6+ gxf6 22. hxg3 Rxd7 {After this lengthy exchange of pieces I end up with an extra piece. } 23. dxc5 {Creating a passed pawn. } Rc8 24. Rac1 d4 { According to chess king, better is Rdc7 to win the c pawn. } 25. Nb3 {Better is Ne4. } d3 26. Rfd1 a4 27. c6 Rd5 28. Nd4 e5 29. Nf5 Kf8 30. Nxh6 Ke7 31. Nf5+ Ke6 32. Ng7+ Ke7 33. Nf5+ Ke6 34. e4 Rdd8 35. Rc5 {Preparing to play Rd5. } Rc7 36. Rd5 Rxd5 { Allows the following combination. } 37. Ng7+ Kd6 38. Ne8+ Ke7 39. Nxc7 Rd8 { Of course getting behind the pawn by playing Rc5 is better but at this point he is lost no matter what. } 40. Nd5+ Ke6 41. Rxd3 Rd6 42. Rc3 { Supporting my pawn. } Rxd5 { I don't understand why he played this move because now he has no chance of winning or drawing. } 43. exd5+ {}
