[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Black opened with a Norwegian Defense.  Nothing fancy, just wondering if he would fall for it.  White didn't. } 2. Qf3 {White responded by bringing his Queen out early.  This is his fairly standard opening in all of the games I played against Shane Hill.  He brings out his Queen after moving one of his pawns.  It's week, but effective if played right.  } Nf6 3. c4 dxe4 4. Qe3 Bf5 5. h3 Nc6 6. c5 Qd5 {As Black, I centralized my Queen at this point.  To prepare the way for an Alekhine Gun. } 7. b3 {He pushes his pawn.  Not too shabby this early in the game. it kind of makes me sweat, actually because he can Fianchetto his bishop.  However, I continue with my plan.} O-O-O {By Castling Queenside.  By castling queenside, I gain the open file with my rook -- after all, another amateur stresses -- "Put your rooks on open files!"  It also tucks my king away in a secure location.  I was confident about this move.  Usually, I castle king side because I feel better about castling King side.  However, this particular game requires the Rook to be on the d file to own this file.  The quickest way to move it to where I need it is to Castle. } 8. Nc3 {He moves his knight to challenge my queen, which is a very good move on his part!  But I planned to dodge anyhow.  But not to the right square, I dodge to . . .} Qe5 {... e5.  My King was in the way before I could complete an Alekhine Gun.  Note though, I could never form an Alekhine Gun in any of my games, even though I try too.  The formation is two rooks on one file with the queen backing them up.  However, my games always results differently against this opponent.  However, I am using my rook effectively by castling Queen side.} 9. Nb5 e6 10. Qg3 {Here, Shane moves his queen to g3.  I should have taken the Queen or his rook, I didn't.  I wanted to make sure my rook is centralized. Talk about a missed opportunity. } Rd5 {But I centralized my Rook.  At this point, White should have taken my Queen.  Free Queen, sitting there.  My queen is a sitting duck, a fair exchange.  Even though I was up a pawn, if White took my queen by Qxe5; then I have to respond with Rxe5 and be down a Queen (7 points).  I would be a pawn up, but still, I would have lost my queen which would make this game longer and much more exciting.} 11. f4 {Instead he challenges my Queen.  Well, I don't have to take his bait so . . .} Qxa1 {I finally ate his Rook. He has deployed only two power pieces on the board, and now I've pinned his bishop to the King.  He could have moved his bishop, but . . . he moved his King. } 12. Kf2 Bxc5+ 13. Ke2 {After getting him in check, he moved his King out of danger. I can have a free knight if I want it, but no.  I want to punish him a little.  I did think that Qxc1 is the better move. } Qxc1 14. Qxg7 {Okay, he knows that it's checkmate in 1 move so he takes a pawn with his queen to distract me.  I panicked!} Qxd2# {Here, I moved my queen to take his pawn.  Covered by the rook, I made an accidental checkmate. }
