1. c4 {Very rarely faced by me, the English is unknown territory for me. Actively, I mean. } Nf6 {A neutral answer, a "can't be bad" move. A more aggressive approach, like d5, istoo risky if not prepared. } 2. Nc3 e6 {Still uncompromising, and aiming for my favourite plan.} 3. e4 {Still farther from my known ground. I tried c6, so to stop Nce's jumps, but it blocked too much my own pieces. } Nc6 {I'll have to live being careful about Nb5. I can live with it. } 4. d4 Bb4 {Now! I'm prepared to exchange this B is needed.} 5. e5 Ne4 {A risky move, but the way to interrupt ideal white's developement. } 6. Nge2 {The correct move. Now, white can't play f3 to kick my N or Qh4+, followed by Nxg3.} d5 {This can only help me freeing my pieces, and surely makes white think a lot. } 7. exd6 e.p. {Now it's my turn to think. I've already decided the move before this one.} Qxd6 {Nxd4 is threatened. I'm taking advance of white's slight delay in developement to press him as much as I can. On a blitz. An opponent stronger than me, who had defeated me several times before. I felt excited, and very scared of making a fatal mistake. So the "be wise and patient, and don't risk foolishly" and the "get the most from you edge, or you'll throw it away" were on their more conflictive moment...} 8. Be3 {Still unreleasing the pin! So I can go on, but how? I need power on the d column, since he is far from castling. And Bd7 was just too passive and slow. } O-O {Against my principles, but it's the shortest way to Rd8 and contest again the weak d4. } 9. a3 {I thought a lot about a sac on b4 (Ba5, b4, Nxb4...) but on a blitz it was too long to calculate, and it "smelled" as a faliure. I couldn't risk to be "vulgar" and throw away a potentially nice game. } Nxc3 {Sigh... needed. I can't reach the pawn c3 / Ne4 situation.} 10. Nxc3 Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 Rd8 {...but now I have some pressure on the colum, and I can start thinking in e5.} 12. Bd3 {? Wonderful! My opponent just gave me the chance to get rid of his very dangerous B pair!} Ne5 {Do you think just because I'm a patzer I'm not able to see combinations? :-)} 13. O-O Nxd3 14. Qxd3 e5 {Now my lsb is finally free to move. But I have to be sure his movement makes a threat for white. } 15. Rfd1 c5 {Still taking advantage from the pin (white underestimated the dangers of his Q's position), threatening to transform a strong mobile center in an isolated pawn or... a closed center. } 16. d5 {Ok. Of course, I have to be lifeling careful about a possible d pawn's push, but essentially white's position is not much better than mine. I'd like to play Bf5, but I won't be wise playing g6 to support it, since my dark square would be fatally weakened. } f5 {...but this makes the most of my position. By playing this, I'm tempting him into his next move, sensing that it will come to my advantage, not his. } 17. Bg5 Rf8 {Pressure on the d column is not needed anymore. My Q is blocking the pawn, but the plan is to move it with a strong threat on white. } 18. f3 {Designed to prevent e4. But I'm not in a hurry. I want to play Bf5 with a threat, and now my dream is near to be true. } f4 {His dsb is now far from action, and the WQ can't penetrate the white squares. Can I say it was a good strategical play by me, and that the underdevelopement was justified?} 19. Qb1 {Very clever attemp to make me fall for Bf5, Qxb7. I don't want to play b6 straight away, but I could: b6, Qb5, a6... and I can still move my lsb without weakesness, but...} Rf7 {This was more in the spirit. A tempo for doubling rooks, later. } 20. Bh4 {White knew he had to spend two moves to make his B active. The sac Be7, QxB, d6, Qd8, d7, Bxd7, Qxb7, Rf7 is a risky continuation for white. But my opponent was not in a "tallish mode".} Bf5 {My dream came true. } 21. Qb2 e4 {The white central pawns are more an annoyance than an advantage for white... or is he just playing too bad?} 22. fxe4 Bxe4 23. Bf2 {? Useless move, that gives me the chance I was waiting for: to take away my Q from d6 with a stronger threat. But I have to be wise, and be sure he is not tempting me into something. He can still play g3... well, not really!} b6 {? Too wise? But in fact: what can white do to prevent the threats? I can allow myself to seal the position. } 24. Rd2 {He knows what's coming, and plans Be1.} Qg6 {Ok. Actually, now I am seriously considering Bxg2 instead. You see this sort of things in Gm's games. But was it sound in this position? Hard to tell. 24... Bxg2, 25. KxB, but after f4+ or Qg4+, Kh1, and white can play Rg1. I well could have told about how I threw away the game for this choice, just pretending to be a GM. I can't see how white can defend. But I see how to attack. } 25. Be1 Rf5 {Now I can choose the column I want to pressure. Of course, not f3 or g3 will help white. } 26. Qb5 {The idea is Qc6, threatening the R and forcing the Q's exchange. But I "forgot" about it during the game. Seriously. So I played.. the righ move!} Rg5 {No time for Qc6, due to Rxg2+!} 27. g3 {Desperado move.} fxg3 {White resigned in view of coutless threats everywhere... :-) I hope I did a fairily nice job this time! :-)}
