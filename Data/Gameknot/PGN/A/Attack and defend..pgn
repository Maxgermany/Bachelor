1. d4 {A very fine first move.} d5 {A fine move, as well.} 2. Nc3 {Hmm, not too bad; I'd have gone Nf3. I don't really like blocking my c-pawn in this type of White-setup.} c6 {This could turn into the Caro-Cann. Via e4.} 3. e4 {And it did!} e6 {Not one of the best responses. I prefer dxe4.} 4. Nf3 {Still getting piece's out.} g6 {Not sure why Black did this? You?} 5. Bf4 {Nice place for a Bishop, don't you agree?} h6 {OK, this is just unbelievable!} 6. Bd3 g5 {Attacking White's DSB. No big deal.} 7. Be5 {Not what I'd call the best place for it. I like Be3/Bg3 best.} Nd7 {?? The losing mistake!} 8. O-O {??? Even worse! White could have won a free rook!} f6 9. Bg3 h5 {Black sure has pushed his pawns - alot!} 10. h4 {?! Not really the best decision. I prefer h3, you?} g4 11. Nd2 {Best square, I think.} c5 12. dxc5 Nxc5 13. Bb5+ {Not too bad.} Bd7 14. b4 {Hmm, White seems to be attacking a lot!} Nxe4 15. Ndxe4 dxe4 16. Qe2 {OK, not entirely bad. I like Bxd7+ Qxd7 Qxd7+ Kxd7 Nxe4.} f5 17. Rad1 {! Forces...} Rh7 {If Nf6?! Be5 with an advantage! I think.} 18. Qc4 {! Planning Qxe6+!} Re7 19. Bxd7+ {! Still going to win a pawn!} Rxd7 20. Qxe6+ {The best move.} Ne7 {Best} 21. Be5 {Maybe Nb5 was best so he could go Nc7+/Nd6+} Rc8 22. Nd5 {?This just lost a piece. I believe that Nb5! was still okay to do even here.} Rxd5 23. Bf6 {? Now he losses the Game :(} Rxd1 24. Rxd1 Qxd1+ 25. Kh2 Qd5 {White's Queen has to take.} 26. Qe5 {Or this!} Qxe5+ 27. Bxe5 {It's all over :(} Rxc2 28. Bd4 Rxa2 29. Bc5 b6 30. Be3 Nd5 31. Bd4 Bxb4 {Resigns. I believe that White could have won with the proper play. Please Comment and rate it on the Star system, thanks!}
