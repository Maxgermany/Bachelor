1. d4 f5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 d6 4. e3 e6 {I was bored of dull games, and I went for something new (and bad). } 5. Nh4 {? Not because "N on the rim is grim" (I hate that rhyme!), but because the WQ can't go to h5 and check. If so, this N assures g6 can't be played to stop the check, on behalf of Nxg6, being a7 pinned to the R. But not now, since the Nf6 is there. } Be7 6. Be2 {Expecting a defeat, I go on (never backwards! :-)} O-O {Well, just where he shouldn't castle! My attack (if any at all!) is aiming there!} 7. g4 {Nxg4, BxN, fxB, Qg4, defending the Na4 with Rg1, and hoping in some black mistake... } g5 {? Just opens the way for my R to his king. No fork, since BxN, but then } 8. Bxg5 {Now the exchange situation is becoming better: I can interpose, after Nxg4, BxBe7, QxB, BxN, fxB, Qxg4 and the N is defended. } fxg4 {I'm not forced to exchange pieces. } 9. Rg1 {This is more subtle, but the column will become free soon. If h5, f3. } e5 {...good!, adding a defender to g4. But...} 10. Bxf6 {I remove one of them. } Bxf6 11. Bxg4 {The N doesn't "hangs" anymore, thanks to Rg1, since after BxN, BxB+ and we are on even terms (any move to shield the check and my B retires). } Bxg4 {This was losing, but it was hard to see it. } 12. Qxg4+ {True, my Q has not a mate right now, but...} Kh8 {? Better was Kf7. Why? It's hard to see. Black is based on the fact that the next move he can play Rg8 and kick my Q away. No matter if it goes Qh5, since Qe8 can follow, stopping Ng6+. But white (take into account, learners!) seems to have a shocking way to end the game. } 13. Ng6+ {After hxN, black seems to be lost, due to a well-known mate pattern. } hxg6 14. Qxg6 {That's all? Yes! Because the Q is threatening mate on h6 (or h5). Rf7 is losing the R for nothing, and...} Qe7 {Seems to save the day, but it's not true, because the Rf8 will become undefended. } 15. Qh6+ {My opponent resigned here, on the basis of the following sequence: } Qh7 16. Qxf8+ Qg8 17. Qxg8# {So, as black, be aware of this kind of attack (you will face, probably, sooner or later), and as white, "be nastier than normal", when attacking: don't stick to the more obvious moves, always look for more moves. You will find some useful surprise, like this one I found on the way. }
