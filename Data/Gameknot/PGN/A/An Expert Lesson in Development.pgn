1. d4 f5 {1. ............. f5 - The Dutch Defense.  This move controls e4, so deterring white from putting a pawn on e4 and getting total control of the centre.} 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 e6 4. c4 {4. c4 - white decides to expand on the queenside and black decides to counterthrust with d5 clearing a square for either the black lsb or the knight to get to it.} d5 5. Qc2 c6 {5. ............ c6 - bolsters the pawn on d5.} 6. Nh3 {6. Nh3 - this move gives the white lsb control over the d5 square and the white knight is eyeing up f4 or g5 which will hit out at e6 and it will need black to open up the kingside with g5 (if Nf4) or h6 (if Ng5), rather risky if I want to castle short.} Bd6 7. Bf4 O-O 8. O-O Bxf4 9. Nxf4 Qe7 10. Nd3 Nbd7 {This is what Ion had to say about my knight move to d7.  I wanted to know whether this was the wrong decision here.  He replied - "Would 10...Bd7 be an improvement over 10...Nbd7? I don't think so, unless you were planning some kind of switch to the K-side (11...Be8-h5, say, which might actually be quite good). But you could equally well have tried, after 13.Nf3 Nf6 14.Ne5 Be6. The WN posting at e5 is an asset, but Black isn't too badly placed, it seems to me." } 11. cxd5 exd5 12. Nd2 {12. Nd2 - completes development and next move that knight will go to f3 and doubly control e5.  I try to exchange off my king knight for white's queen knight but Ion just won't buy into it.} Ne4 13. Nf3 Nd6 14. e3 Nf7 {14. .......... Nf7 - I think due to Ion's earlier note this was the loser.  Although it contests control of e5 it ensures my lsb is blocked in and it hinders the completion of my development.  If I had played Nf3 - although that would have allowed one of Ion's knights to come to e5, that would have allowed e6 and then one of the knights could have then gone to f7 or e7 and perhaps forced an exchange of one or both of the knights.} 15. b4 Qd6 {15. ..... Qd6 - Glenda lends support to the c6 pawn preparing b6 allowing the lsb to come out via b7 or a6 connecting my rooks.} 16. a4 b6 17. Rfc1 Bb7 18. a5 bxa5 19. Rxa5 {19. Rxa5 - I did manage to complete my development, but white has developed much pressure on my queenside.  The queenside pawns are now busted and white will eventually win my a pawn.} a6 20. Nc5 Nxc5 21. bxc5 Qd7 {21. ............. Qd7 - this move was necessary because the f pawn is hanging.  However it wastes a vital tempo.  If Glenda had gone straight to c7 then I would have had time to back off my bishop to c8 and swap off one pair of rooks on the b file.  In a pressure situation like this time is of the essence!  If I had perhaps got in an earlier g6 then Glenda could have gone straight to c7 and all may have been well.} 22. Rb1 Rfb8 23. Qb3 Qc7 24. Qb6 Qxb6 25. Rxb6 {25. Rxb6 - the queen swap does not ease the pressure on black's position.  Taking back with the rook is sooo much better than the pawn as there is a chance that the white pawn could drop off.} Kf8 {25. ........... Kf8 - Henry makes for d7 to support the c6 pawn, but he is stopped in his tracks by ...........} 26. Bf1 Ke7 27. Bxa6 Bxa6 28. Rbxa6 Rxa6 29. Rxa6 Rc8 {29. .............. Rc8 - after a plethora of exchanges, black is not only a pawn minus but my rook is reduced to utter passivity defending the backward pawn on c6.  The only white pawns on Ion's second rank are the f pawn and the h pawn.  They are defended by the white king so no counter targets here.} 30. Ne1 {30. Ne1 - makes for e5 or b5, either way striking out at the c6 pawn.  Ion chooses to plonk it on e5 after I back my knight off to d8 to defend the stricken c pawn.  Note that with the knight on e5, Henry is prevented from defending c6 which would have released the black rook for action down the open b file.} Kf6 31. Nd3 Nd8 32. Ne5 Rc7 33. f4 h6 34. Ra8 Ne6 35. Rg8 {Ion - I don't know whether 35...Rg8 was best but it did seem to mean that if Black wanted to get play, she would have to give up her c-pawn... } Ke7 36. h3 Kf6 37. Kf2 Ke7 38. g4 Kf6 {38. ........... Kf6 - while Ion is consolidating I am reduced to shunting Henry from e7 to f6 to avoid further loss of material.} 39. Kg3 fxg4 40. hxg4 Ke7 {40. .......... Ke7.  The king goes back to e7 for the last time.} 41. f5 {41. f5 - the killer -  for example:- 41. f5 Ng5  42. Rxg7  Kd8  43. Rg6  - white could also force an exchange of rooks with Rxc7 which still wins but more slowly but I think this is the best move here (I will be a second pawn down and about to lose a third - the g and f pawns will become passed and the c pawn continues to be a target - this pawn will fall if I try to counter with my rook.  I do not think that my rook will be able to mop up Ion's pawns in time - therefore time to resign!)  So ends the lesson on how retarded development can be severely punished by the strong player.  Have a nice day everyone!  Joanne }
