1. e4 {Hi everyone!  My brave opponent decided to try out the Allgaier Gambit against me.  This involved sacrificing a piece to get Henry out into the open and then get at him.  Unfortunately for him, Henry was able to run for cover and I was able to run away with my extra piece in the endgame.  My opponent thought this was too much and decided to wave the white flag.  So, how did this happen?  Firstly I will provide the link that Gameknot Analysis has given to help you through this game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17272114&fb=1&rnd=0.2644588537214342.  We start with a double KP opening 1.e4 and I respond with e5 and he gives me the KG with 2.f4 of which I accept.} e5 2. f4 {2. f4 - King's Gambit.} exf4 {2. ..... exf4 - I accept.} 3. Nf3 {3. Nf3 - development and stops Glenda from going to h4.} g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ng5 {5. Ng5!? - interesting move - this move allows the knight to be trapped but this also turns the KGA into the Allgaier Gambit of which I must accept because as you will see .....} h6 6. Nxf7 {6. Nxf7 - ..... Glenda and my KR are forked so in order too avoid losing a rook, Henry must take the knight and face the big, wide world.} Kxf7 7. Nc3 Nc6 {7. ..... Nc6 - with Henry exposed I must get my pieces out asap.} 8. Bc4+ d5 {8. ..... d5 - I must return a pawn or two in order to get my pieces out and to give Henry some cover - he's shivering, poor old guy and is in dire need of some really thick medieval stockings!} 9. Bxd5+ Kg7 {9. .... Kg7 - Henry does find a modicum of refuge but with the advanced kingside pawns the cover is very flimsy indeed!  I think he needs an extra cloak as well as those stockings so Glenda must still get those knitting needles going!  } 10. d4 {10. d4 - trying to establish a formidable pawn centre.} Bd6 11. e5 Bb4 {11. ..... Bb4 - pin.} 12. Bxc6 Bxc3+ 13. bxc3 bxc6 {13. ...... bxc6 - both of us trade bishops and end up with identical pawn structures on the queenside.} 14. h5 Qg5 {14. .... Qg5 - aha, by express delivery we get those medieval stockings and that cloak for out comes Glenda to g4 on her broomstick to deliver them.  Should white castle kingside, Glenda also eagerly awaits the WK.} 15. g3 Ne7 {15. .... Ne7 - I cannot save the f4 pawn so I decided to clear the back decks by bringing out my knight to help cover Henry and to also lend a hand to attack the WK.} 16. Bxf4 Qf5 {17. ..... Qf5 - Glenda still hovers over the WK.} 17. O-O {17. 0-0 - So, white castles kingside.  Glenda now evades the threat of a discovered attack (Bxh6+) by swiping the undefended white pawn on h5.} Qxh5 18. Qe2 Be6 {18. ..... Be6 - now Fou Leblanc finally emerges and clears the decks.  Once my KR gets east of the g column I will have castled by hand.  Fou Leblanc also supports a possible knight move to d5 or f5.} 19. c4 Nf5 {19. .... Nf5 - my knight chooses f5 as it bears down onto g3.  If it were not for white's dsb then the Wicked Witch of the West and the white KR would be forked.} 20. c3 Qh3 {20. ..... Qh3 - Glenda moves very close to the WK and I now threaten to win the g3 pawn.} 21. Rad1 Nxg3 22. Bxg3 Qxg3+ {22. ...... Qxg3+ - and I duly win that pawn and am now a full piece up.} 23. Kh1 Qh3+ {23. ..... Qh3+ - no I am not planning a perpetual check.  This queen check is to clear the path for g3 putting even more pressure on the WK.} 24. Kg1 g3 {24. .... g3 - I duly play this move.  Amazingly Gameknot Analysis flagged this as a mistake.  The move did prove good enough, however, to force resignation.  I will be interested to hear your views on the Allgaier Gambit.  Anyhow, I hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne}
