1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Qd4 {A new (for me) way to play the Budapest for white.} Bb4+ 5. Bd2 Bxd2+ 6. Nxd2 Qg5 {Now I can move my queen to the best square.} 7. h3 {A possibility was Qh5, pinning the rook. But I wasn't sure.} Nxe5 {If f4, Qg3+.} 8. Ngf3 Nxf3+ 9. Nxf3 Qa5+ {Always pushing...} 10. Qd2 {But now I realized I had nothing more to do.} Qxd2+ 11. Nxd2 d6 {So it is a slow developement game.} 12. e3 b6 {It seemed good for me to try to control the black squares with pawns, and the light ones with the bishop.} 13. a3 Bb7 {Now white is uneasy.} 14. f3 {The only way. His lsb is not healthy} Nd7 15. b4 O-O {e3 is somelike weak. Let's try to exploit it. } 16. e4 Rae8 {Threatening f5. } 17. Bd3 f5 18. O-O f4 {An outpost. Nothing clear is coming up.} 19. Rfe1 Ne5 {Blocks forever the pawn. } 20. Be2 Rf6 21. Nb3 Ng6 {Trying to reach h4, but still not a real plan. } 22. Kh2 Re5 {Let's try using the space I have. } 23. Nd4 Ne7 {Blunder. Now, Nb5 wins a pawn. } 24. Bd3 a6 {Fortunately for me, he doesn't see it. } 25. a4 c5 26. Nc2 Rfe6 {Purposeless move, but it was difficult to find a plan. } 27. b5 a5 {The kingside is my future.} 28. Re2 g5 29. Rae1 {Useless moves by white, too...} h5 30. g3 fxg3+ 31. Kxg3 Ng6 {Blocking f4, and threatening Nf4.} 32. Re2e3 h4+ {Blocking again this side. But the king has to go back, unless he wants to be mated with the bishop on c8.} 33. Kh2 Nf4 34. Bf1 {Correct, defending h3. My idea is not to exchange the bishop, since my knight whorts more.} Bc8 {Anyway, my bishop is useless on b7. } 35. Bg2 Rf6 36. Rg1 Nh5 {A knight on g3 can't be bad...} 37. Bf1 Ng3 38. Ne1 Kh7 {My king will help... maybe.} 39. Bg2 Kh6 40. Nd3 {Ouch!} Re7 41. e5 dxe5 42. Rxe5 Rxe5 43. Nxe5 Rf4 {Bad plan. } 44. Rd1 Nf5 {Fortunately (this word should be cause of shame), the knight covers d6, but I am losing the bishop, and I didn't realize it. } 45. Rd8 Bb7 46. Rb8 Nd6 {Fortunately again, the knight saves me. } 47. Bf1 Rf5 48. Ng4+ Kg7 49. Be2 {Probably a stalled position. I tried something, but it was a blunder. } Bxf3 50. Bxf3 Rxf3 51. Rxb6 Nxc4 52. Rc6 Rf5 53. b6 {...because of this move. } Nxb6 {What the hell...} 54. Rxb6 c4 55. Rc6 Rf4 56. Ne3 Rf2+ 57. Kg1 Rf3 58. Nxc4 Rxh3 {Now, he has a piece (and a soon-to-be-free pawn), but I have two joined and passed pawns... let's see.} 59. Nxa5 Ra3 60. Rc4 Ra2 {Retaining the king on the 1st row.} 61. Nb3 h3 62. Rg4 Kh6 63. a5 Kh5 64. Rd4 g4 {Better, now. } 65. Rd2 Ra3 66. Rd5+ Kh4 67. Nd2 Kg3 {Blunder. But it was not easy to find the right way to act.} 68. Ne4+ Kf3 69. Ng5+ Kg3 70. Ne4+ Kf4 {I didn't want to play for draw, even risking to lose. } 71. Nf2 Rg3+ 72. Kh1 Rf3 73. Kg1 Kg3 74. Ne4+ Kf4 75. Nf2 {Not Ke3 because of Rd3+. But my move was a blunder. } Ra3 76. Rd4+ Kf5 77. Rxg4 Ra1+ 78. Kh2 Ra2 79. Kxh3 Rxf2 {I swear I have time to stop the pawn, but this is a draw. } 80. Ra4 Rd2 81. a6 Rd8 82. Rb4 Ra8 83. Rb6 Kf4 84. Kg2 Ke5 85. Kf2 Kd5 86. Ke3 Kc5 87. Re6 Kb5 88.
