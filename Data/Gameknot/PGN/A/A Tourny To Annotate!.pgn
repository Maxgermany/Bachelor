1. Nf3 {This is the other game between tag1153 and me that I've been slow about annotating, but here it is.  Again, as always tell me about any logical errors or typos.  This is probably the most flexible way for White to start the game. It forces Black to choose what to do without wasting a tempo.} c5 {Black decides to play for a Sicilian or English set up.} 2. d4 {White immediately challenges Black's center. It should be noted that White has so far done an excellent job of remaining flexible. This game could transition into QGD or QGA territory, or into Sicilian lines still. This game remains very open ended.} cxd4 {I try hard not to do this when I annotate, but I'm going to step into my personal feelings about the game from behind the Black pieces rather than be objective for just a second.  I am a fairly conservative player who likes to keep opening lines fairly fixed. The way White has played until now was driving me absolutely crazy because there was no guarantee as to which opening the game would move into.  So, Black decides to eliminate the QG lines and the English lines. Of course, White still has the option of guiding the game into tons of other openings, and things that resemble other openings. White is still very flexible.} 3. Nxd4 {Recapturing with the Queen would have simply wasted a tempo after 3. ...Nc6.} g6 {Black is trying to get rid of the flexibility of the position still.} 4. c4 {Finally, White commits to something. Now that he's decided what he wants to play, Black can start to form a plan of attack (or defense).} Bg7 {Black begins his development by giving his Bishop access to the long diagonal.} 5. e4 {Now White has really committed to an opening. This is called the Maroczy Bind for White. Black's specific line of the Sicilian here is the Accelerated Dragon.  White's control of the light squares will cause Black a lot of trouble trying to get his light-squared Bishop into an effective position. Normally, in the Accelerated Dragon, Black has enough trouble with that, but with a Maroczy Bind, it becomes and absolute nightmare.} Nc6 {This is now book Accelerated Dragon against the Maroczy Bind.} 6. Nxc6 {This however, is not. The capture of the Knight on c6 is normally characteristic of very sharp games. Normally, in the Maroczy Bind, White wants to keep Black's play to a minimum, but by doing this, he removes his Knight from its powerful post on d4 and releases tension in the center. He also increases the Bishop on g7's power tremendously.} bxc6 7. Qc2 {I would assume that this move stems from the pressure coming from the g7 Bishop.  However, it should also serve as a clue to Black that White could be planning to castle long. Of course, Black can't know absolutely yet, but this move hints at it.} Nf6 {Black simply continues developing. He's ready to castle now and adding pressure to the center.} 8. Nc3 {White has to develop too of course! This placement on his Knight relieves a bit of the pressure that Black is applying to the center. } Qa5 {This was a wasted move. The Black Queen ends up going straight back to c7.} 9. Bd2 Qc7 {Now there is a slight tension between the Queens. It's nothing large yet, but it affects both players' central plans. If Black ever tries to open the center with ...d5, the resulting trades would open the c-file for the Queens to have at each other.  This isn't to say that both players should try to put as much pressure on the c-file as possible yet, only that they should consider this small tension in their plans and calculations.} 10. Bd3 {Both of White's Bishop's are activated and gunning for the kingside. If the Queen on c2 weren't a good enough hint, this is a clear indication that White plans to castle queenside. The only reason this can be so readily determined is that the light-squared Bishop has no entry into Black's position unless White launches a kingside pawn storm, and usually, you don't storm with pawns in front of the King.} d6 {Black is now committing to playing with the Bind in place, meaning that he doesn't intend to challenge it. Black needs to be very careful when he does this because it commits him to carefully watching White's powerful attacking ideas for the duration of the Bind.  Black's idea here isn't to develop the Bishop (it's fairly useless everywhere, that's the nature of the Maroczy Bind), but to connect the Rooks in a couple of moves. He will put his Bishop on e6 (which blocks the pawn, but it's safe) so that it can apply the infinitesimal amount of pressure it's capable of applying.   I think though, that Black would have been better off if he had just played ...Ba6 at some point and left his Queen's scope untouched.} 11. O-O-O {There's the castle that White's been flagging since move 7! It's only too bad that Black hasn't done much to prepare for it.  Also, it should be noted that by placing his King on the c-file, White has created more tension (negative tension for him) there.} Be6 {The Bishop adds its small bit of tension to the c-file.} 12. h4 {And the pawn storm that we had forecasted is now raining down on Black's kingside.} h5 {Black attempts to create a figurative umbrella by moving the key point of attack of the pawn storm to g4, a square that he has marked several times, and has the ability to add support to.} 13. f3 {White prepares to advance to g4.} O-O {Black feels safe enough to castle, and it would seem that he is. However, he needs to be constantly ready to defend against any possible attacks that White can initiate on the kingside, which means that Black's minor pieces are basically stuck defending.} 14. Be3 {White is now beginning to take advantage of Black's tethered pieces by placing his on its optimum square. It is often said that when there are no threats to you, or you have time to spare that you should place all of your pieces on their optimum squares before launching your attack, and that is exactly what White did.} Rab8 {Black decides to begin to do the same for his pieces. However, his minor pieces are chained to the defense of the kingside, so the effect of his optimally placed pieces will be considerably less than White's pieces' effect. This is one of the key elements of the Maroczy Bind if Black doesn't manage to break it down (or in this case Black doesn't even try to break it down).} 15. Be2 {White continues to increase the value of his pieces. If this were a video I would make all of the arrows from White's pieces into Black's kingside, but since I can't you'll have to imagine them. The Rook on h1 influences the entire h-file. The two Bishops and the Queen pressure virtually every diagonal leading into the Black camp (notice that the light-squared Bishop is going to facilitate g4 after Rg1 (after Rg1 notice the new imaginary arrow pointing directly at the Black King)). White's attack is swelling to unbelievable strength.} Rb7 {Black ignores White's threat. He prepares to double his Rooks on the b-file and create an invasion of his own. However, I think that it would come just too late. If 16. Rdg1 Rgb8 17. b3! and Black's attack is stopped for long enough for White to start his own.} 16. Kd2 {White has not only wasted that precious tempo, but he has made his King critically weak! Suddenly, the pressure on the c and b-files seems stronger, and now Black has a reason to blow the center wide open!} d5 {Although Black has been happy to play in the cramped, time-critical Maroczy Bind, he has been nicely prompted by White to shatter the center and start a vicious counterattack.} 17. exd5 {This sequence of moves is kind of cool to me because you can watch the center loosen brick by brick. You can also watch Black's pieces become tremendously powerful. White's pieces will go from well-placed for attack to terribly placed as White needs to defend quickly (and they won't even have to move!).} cxd5 18. cxd5 Nxd5 {Now we can see the tension between the Queens that I mentioned at the beginning. Though it would have been possible for the game to finish without this tension ever having been exploited, it was one of the subtleties of the position.} 19. Nxd5 {Black sees an interesting tactic where he at least wins a piece after 19. ...Qxc2  20. Kxc2 Rxb2  21. Kd3 (21. Kc1 is what happened in the game) Bf5  22. Kc4 Rc8  23. Bc5 Rc2 } Qxc2+ 20. Kxc2 Rxb2+ 21. Kc1 {White plays the wrong move here. This allows Black to deliver the coup de gras.} Rc8+ {Now White can only sacrifice minor pieces to postpone his execution, so he resigned. 0-1}
