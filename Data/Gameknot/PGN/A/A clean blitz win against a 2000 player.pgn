[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian, my favourite. } 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nf3 {As is expected from higher-rated players, my opp doesn't go for the naive Nc3 - which is good, but I am used to play against it. } Bg4 4. Be2 Nf6 5. c4 {A good one for white in this scheme. } Qa5 {Preventing white to move d4 for a moment, and a step toward Qc2.} 6. Nc3 c6 {Necessary to control knight's jumps to the 5th rank. } 7. O-O Nbd7 8. d4 {Strong and normally enough to win.} e6 {At this point, white's moves are d5 or Bf4.} 9. Bd2 Qc7 {At last. Now the black diagonal is covered. } 10. h3 {Natural, but...} h5 {This is the best part of a "my" Scandinavian. } 11. hxg4 {White takes the bait!} hxg4 {Black recovers the piece because of Qh2#} 12. Ne5 {Only defence. } Nxe5 13. dxe5 Qxe5 {Renewing the threat. } 14. f4 Qh5 {Renewing the threat. I think it is better than c5+ at once. } 15. Kf2 {The only move. } Bc5+ {Now it is lethal. } 16. Be3 Qh4+ {Not g3+, since after Ke1 the white king is almost shielded. } 17. g3 Qh2+ 18. Ke1 {Black can recover the piece here, but I like to attack. Chess is about it. } Qxg3+ 19. Bf2 Bxf2+ 20. Rxf2 Rh1+ 21. Bf1 {White is struggling to shield his king. } Rd8 22. Qe2 Rd3 {I think it was the right way to go on with the attack, threatening Re3. } 23. Qxd3 {I think white gave up the game here, in a certain way. } Qxd3 {Or it was a simple overlook that the bishop is pinned. Anyway, black was even in material (now with a huge advantage) even before the queen's sac. } 24. Rd1 Qe3+ 25. Ne2 Ne4 {Or g3. } 26. Rg2 g3 {What can white do?} 27. Rd4 {Nice, white wants to further exchange material in order to free his position. } c5 {Giving him a push, just to be sure. } 28. Rxe4 Qxe4 {White can take the g3 pawn, now. } 29. Rxg3 {But it doesn't work. } Qb1+ 30. Kd2 Rxf1 {Or Qxb2+. But black is confident the game is won. } 31. Rb3 Qe1+ {After Kmoves, black has plenty of ways to further exchange material and win, so my opponent resigned. }
