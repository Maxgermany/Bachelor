[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nd2 c5 4. e3 Qb6 {Starting the known game of the poisoned pawn (b2).} 5. c3 {He allows it. I decided to take, even knowing I'm risking my Q to become trapped.} Qxb2 6. Ne2 d5 {I did this in order to prevent Nc4, but it is hard for me to decide for another move. Nd5 could have been more precise.} 7. Bxb8 {Strange decision, but ok.} Rxb8 8. Nb3 {Not the way to trap my Q, if even possible.} c4 9. Nd2 Bd7 10. a4 {...this looks much more straight into the point.} Qb6 11. g3 Bd6 12. Bh3 g5 {White's hyppopotamus setup is passive, so why not grabbing some space on the Kside?} 13. f3 h5 14. Bg2 {Another weak move. Now, which pawn to advance?} e5 15. O-O {Even better! Castling under he fire!} exd4 16. cxd4 g4 {The engine gives h4 as better and this as a mistake. I don't understand it very well. } 17. f4 h4 18. Nc3 {...pressing my central pawn.} hxg3 {As long as I can leave the Wlsb on the d square, but go on with the attack it's all ok. } 19. hxg3 Bc6 {I won't break that fortress in two moves, so I better defend my side.} 20. Qc2 {Threatens Qf5, but it's not dangerous.} Nh5 {I played this provocative move. If Qf5, Nxg3 forks Q and R. If Nxd4 now...} 21. Kf2 Qd8 {This was my pure intuition: I saw a nice mate if white takes the N in g3, and I went for it.} 22. Qf5 {Fortunately, my opponent didn't see it and didn't play Rh1. This allows me to finish in stlyle.} Nxg3 {The situation is far from clear after white gives up the exchange with Qxg4, NxRf1, followed by Qg7. But we'll never know it for sure. } 23. Kxg3 Qh4# {}
