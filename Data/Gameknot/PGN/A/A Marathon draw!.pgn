1. e4 {This game I am annotating on behalf of my team captain, Dynamic Dave. It is a 117 move marathon draw! Did either side miss a win? Please let us know!} c6 {The Caro-Kann Defence} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {This is the advance variation. Other moves are playable.} Bf5 {Black takes the chance to develop the bishop outside the pawn chain} 4. Nf3 e6 5. Be2 {This is standard development for this variation.} c5 6. Be3 cxd4 7. Nxd4 {White has better development so tries to open up the position.} Ne7 8. c4 Nd7 {8.....Nd7 seems a departure from the opening databases. Nbc6, dxc4 or Bxb1 are the usual moves} 9. cxd5 Qa5+ 10. Bd2 Qxd5 {Threatening the knight and the pg2} 11. Nb5 {Threatening the fork on c7 and the check on d6} Kd8 12. O-O {Having lost the right to castle I would have thought white had an edge now} Nc6 13. Bc3 Ndxe5 14. Qxd5+ exd5 15. Rd1 f6 {With the queens off, losing the right to castle is less important} 16. Rxd5+ Kc8 17. Rd1 {I am not sure why white retreated here. Why not just N(b)-a3?} Bc5 18. Rd5 {Particularly if you are going to return to the same square!} Be7 19. Nb1a3 {white has now lost a tempo} Be6 20. Rdd1 Rd8 21. Rxd8+ Kxd8 22. Rd1+ Kc8 {white may still have a slight edge as the black rook doesn't have many prospects} 23. Nd6+ Bxd6 24. Rxd6 Bxa2 25. f4 Nf7 26. Rd3 Kc7 27. Rg3 Rg8 28. Bd3 g6 29. Rh3 h5 30. Bxf6 {and so material balance is again restored. The fact that white has a king side majority and black a queen side majority means there are some chances of one side winning} Nb4 31. Bf1 Be6 32. Rc3+ Kb8 33. Re3 Bd5 34. Bc3 Nc6 35. b4 a6 36. b5 axb5 37. Nxb5 Rc8 38. Rg3 Be4 39. Bc4 Ncd8 {white has the two bishops, but only a minimal advantage} 40. Na3 Rc6 41. Re3 Bf5 42. h4 {I am not convince by 42. h4. It makes it even harder for white to generate a passed pawn on the king side.} Nd6 43. Be5 Kc8 44. Bf1 Nd8f7 45. Bb2 Rb6 46. Bc1 Bd7 47. Rf3 {A draw could have been agreed here. The players show good fighting spirit playing on.} Nf5 48. Rh3 Nf7d6 49. Bd2 Ne4 50. Be1 Nfg3 {It gets interesting around here. 50. Nfg3 discovered an attack on the Rh3 with the bishop. If 51. RxN, NxR 52. BxN then Rb3 attacks the Bg3 and Nh3, so white attacks the black rook first.} 51. Nc4 Rb1 52. Rxg3 Nxg3 53. Bxg3 {The white bishop and knight are slightly stronger than the black rook, but turning it into a win is very hard.} Rb3 54. Kh2 Kd8 55. Ne5 Bf5 56. Bc4 Ra3 57. Bf2 Kc7 58. Bf7 {Round about here, white stated to decline a number of draw offers} Ra6 59. Bd4 Be4 60. Kg3 Rd6 61. Bc3 Ra6 62. Kf2 Bf5 63. Ke3 Ra3 64. Kd2 {I prefer Kd4, although I guess the king is less exposed to rook checks here.} Ra6 65. g3 Kd8 66. Bb4 Kc7 67. Kc3 Kc8 {black is just marking time, but can white do anything?} 68. Bc5 Kc7 69. Kb4 Be4 70. Kb5 Bf5 71. Kb4 Be4 72. Kc4 Kc8 73. Be7 Kc7 74. Bb4 Bf5 75. Kc3 Kc8 76. Be7 Kc7 77. Bc5 Kc8 78. Kb4 Kc7 79. Kb5 Rf6 80. Bd5 Ra6 81. Nf7 Be6 {I find this move rather strange. Normally the defending side should exchange pawns, but not pieces. White didn't seem to be making any progress.} 82. Bxe6 Rxe6 83. Ne5 Ra6 84. Bb4 Re6 85. Bc5 Ra6 86. Kc4 Kd8 87. Bb4 Kc8 88. Kd5 Kc7 89. Nc4 Kd7 90. Bd6 b5 91. Ne5+ Ke8 92. Nxg6 {Aha! It is getting interesting again. Black is pushing his passed pawn, but white has captured a pawn and has his own king side pawn.} b4 93. Ne5 b3 94. Nc4 Ra2 95. Be5 Rg2 96. f5 Ke7 97. f6+ Kf7 98. Kd6 Re2 99. Kd7 Rf2 100. Bd4 Rf1 101. Nd6+ Kf8 102. f7 {This looks very good for white, to me.} Re1 103. Bf6 Rf1 104. Be7+ Kg7 105. f8=B+ {I'm not sure why he promoted to a bishop!} Rxf8 106. Bxf8+ Kxf8 107. Nc4 Kf7 {but now white has to keep his knight on the queen side to stop the pawn queening, and he cannot save his king side pawns.} 108. Kd6 Kf6 109. Kd7 Kf7 110. Ne5+ Kf6 111. Nc4 Kf7 112. Nb2 Kf6 113. Nd3 Kf5 114. Ke7 Ke4 115. Nb2 Ke5 116. Na4 Kd5 117. Kd7 Ke5 {An interesting struggle! Well played both players.}
