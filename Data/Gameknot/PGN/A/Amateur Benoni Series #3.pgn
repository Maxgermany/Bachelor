1. d4 {Here's a game in a relatively modern variation of the Modern Benoni. Black gets in a quick ...b5 and ultimately creates enough threats on the queenside to convert his initiative into a winning passed pawn.} Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nf3 e6 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nc3 g6 7. e4 a6 {This move is a recent invention, and a rather brilliant one. Black wants to avoid a situation where White has played both h3 (preventing ...Bg4) and  a4 (tying up ...a6/...b5 counterplay), so he delays ...Bg7 to do it. Alternative variation: [ Specifically, Black sidesteps this situation:] 7... Bg7 8. h3 a6 9. a4 [ which isn't objectively better or worse for him (it is a main line of the Modern Classical, though ...0-0 and Bd3 often occur before ...a6), but it does allow White a lasting bind that is difficult to break. Not much fun for a Black player seeking immediate complications.] } 8. h3 {White chooses to prevent ...Bg4. I prefer 8.a4 here, as a Benoni player is basically satisfied with his position after getting away with an early ...b5, when his queenside counterplay is obvious. It's also true that Black's ...Bg4 idea (trading off an awkward piece for the f3 knight who threatens d2-c4 as well as supporting e4-e5) is double-edged (Black's light squares become quite weak), while ...b5 really isn't. Still, this is very much a main line with 8.h3 and Black has many challenges to equality. Alternative variation: 8. a4 Bg4 9. Be2 Bxf3 10. Bxf3 [is, I think, a bit more testing for Black. Unfortunately I tend to write these things and then have to face the "most testing" variations over the board several days later. I'm beginning to see why so many chess writers in the past have been accused of 'shady' evaluations of certain critical lines they happen to face in serious games!] Alternative variation: [ Attempting to exploit Black's lack of space and development is] 8. Qe2 [ aiming to force an early e4-e5 before Black can develop.] Bg4 9. e5 dxe5 10. Qxe5  Be7 11. Bh6 [looks rather miserable for Black, who should probably looks for a better plan than ...Bg4 here.] } b5 9. Bd3 Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. a3 {Crudely discouraging ...b5-b4 and even suggesting b2-b4 in a few lines. Probably the best move here. It is worth noting that White's main ideas in this variation involve first snuffing out Black's chances for counterplay. This is basically sufficient for an advantage, as Black is perpetually cramped if his queenside play doesn't work out and he fails to trade off pieces. Fortunately, White does not have enough time to stop all of Black's active plans in the Benoni. } Re8 {The struggle turns to development and the threatened e4-e5 for a moment, given the queenside bottleneck. } 12. Re1 Nbd7 {Not really the main move, as it allows White to pressure the d6 weakness with tempo. Still, Black's plan revolves around creating an outpost square on c5 and generating queenside counterplay. Alternative variation: 12... Ra7 [is often preferred. The rook proves very flexible on a7 and often swings to e7 to pressure e4. I've had a few bad experiences in this line, which probably says more about me than the line itself, but nowadays I prefer the ...Nbd7 plan.] 13. Bf4 Rae7 14. Qd2 Qb6 15. b4 Nbd7 [looks OK (White is probably a little better), but Black doesn't have much active play.] } 13. Bf4 c4 {The point. The knight may now occupy c5 and Black is a bit less cramped. The light-squared pawn chain is still fairly mobile given Black's dark square support and ...a5 and ...b4 possibilities. This does allow Bxd6, which works out tactically but leads to exchanges that Black doesn't really mind. } 14. Bc2 {Clearly the main move. Be2 is ridiculous and Bf1 looks passive. Alternative variation: [After] 14. Bxd6 cxd3 15. Qxd3 Nb6 16. e5 Bf5 17. Qd4 [Black may as well give back the piece, but he has basically defused White's pressure and should be equal.] Nc4 18. exf6 Qxf6 19. Qxf6 Bxf6 [and Black's bishop pair and c4 outpost is enough to claim winning chances, though objectively the game should draw.] 20. Bc5 Nxb2 21. Bd4 Bxd4 22. Nxd4 Kg7 } Nc5 15. Qd2 {We're still in theory, and this is the main move, planning Bh6 to trade off the dangerous g7 bishop. Alternative variation: [The thematic] 15. e5 [is now possible, and it is typically sharp. ] dxe5 16. Rxe5 Bb7 17. Qd2 Qb6 [gives Black plenty of activity.] } Bb7 {The only serious reply. It seems to clog up Black's b-file ambitions, but the long diagonal pressure discourages e4-e5 and now Black can develop his queen without stranding the Re8. } 16. Bh6 {Alternative variation: [The 'obvious'] 16. Rad1 [ allows Black to preserve his strong bishop, e.g.] Nh5 17. Bh6 Bh8 18. Bg5 Qb6 [ and Black is doing well. White should probably try for a passer with e5 and d6, but it looks like Black can blockade for equality.] 19. e5 dxe5 20. d6 Bxf3 21. gxf3 Rad8 22. Bxd8 Qxd8 [leaves White up the Exchange but completely lacking active ideas. If he pushes too hard, Black's active pieces should tell - f4 in particular is a serious weakness. I actually prefer Black.] } Bxh6 17. Qxh6 a5 {This is where the complications begin. White can simply snatch the pawn, but then his e-pawn drops, the d5 pawn is weak, and Black relieves some tension via exchanges. Of course Black is mustering a queenside initiative, threatening ...b4, and it is not at all obvious what White should do. } 18. Ng5 {A very annoying move, and incredibly double-edged. White's pressure on h7 is permanent, which ties down the f6 knight to defense. White will try to dislodge the knight, but meanwhile the queen knight are rather offside and Black can use his superior numbers on the queenside to gain a serious initiative. Alternative variation: 18. Nxb5 Ncxe4 19. Bxe4 Rxe4 20. Rxe4 Nxe4 21. Re1 f5 22. Nc3 Qf8 [is pretty forcing and probably White's best try to carry some winning chances into the endgame, but it is not clear.] 23. Qf4 Nxc3 24. bxc3 Bxd5 25. Rd1 Bf7 26. Rxd6 Rd8 [and Black seems to have defended. He has a bad bishop vs. White's queen knight combo, but he is very solid in defense and it looks like a draw.] } b4 19. Na4 {A very strong reply. White challenges the strong c5 knight without resolving the queenside tension. Alternative variation: 19. axb4 axb4 20. Rxa8 Bxa8 [is great for Black, who will play for a passed c-pawn while White struggles to find a plan.] } Nd3 {A common (albeit strange-looking) Benoni maneuver. Clearly a knight on d3 is very strong, and it can easily hop onward to e5 or back to c5 as necessary. At first it seems like White can just take it and pick up a loose pawn, but things aren't so simple. } 20. Re3 {Alternative variation: 20. Bxd3 cxd3 21. Rad1 Ba6 [and Black has activated his bishop and opened up queenside lines. He should be better.] } Ba6 {Aiding the d3 knight. } 21. b3 {Another active move from White, challenging the d3 knight further. } Rc8 {A tricky move that may not be best, even though the resulting complications essentially win the game for Black. The text encourages White to capture on c4 and open up lines on the queenside. White gains at least a pawn temporarily and Black gets active play. Alternative variation: [More solid is] 21... Ne5 22. f4 Ned7 [ but it's hardly an inspiring continuation, especially over the board.] 23. e5 dxe5 24. f5 Qe7 25. Nxh7 Nxh7 26. fxg6 fxg6 27. Rg3 [ and the computer thinks Black is fine, but this looks miserable.] } 22. bxc4 Ne5 23. Nb2 Qb6 {The key idea of Black's ...Rc8. He will finally activate the queen via b6-d4 (which comes with tempo) and highlight the weak dark squares in White's camp. This continuation involves the sacrifice of at least one pawn, but Black's rooks have easy activation and of course White's queen knight are stuck offside on h7. The computer still likes White at this point, but the game is getting very sharp as it is difficult for White to defend against Black's ideas without slipping into passivity or dropping a piece - he has very little coordination. } 24. axb4 Qd4 {The queen is actually well placed here. Rd1 is not a real threat because the b2 knight is pinned to the a1 rook and will take several moves to extract. This buys Black time in attack. } 25. Rb1 Bxc4 {The only move. The c8 rook now enters the game along an open file, and the knight on c4 is quite strong. Alternative variation: [Much weaker is] 25... axb4 [ because it allows White to coordinate quickly and keep material, e.g.] 26. Ba4 Re7 27. Rb3 Rb7 [and now] 28. Rd1 Qc5 [ and the c4 pawn is poison with the rooks threatening all manner of pins.] } 26. Nxc4 Rxc4 {The most vigorous recapture, threatening ...Rxc2 and ...Rxb4 while allowing the e8 rook to swing into the game unimpeded. Black has been running the show thus far, but White's position remains basically solid and Black has no obvious advantage beyond activity and a favorable sharpness of play. If he is not careful, White will regroup and play the natural f4 and e5 with devastating effect. Black needs more ideas. } 27. Rd1 Qb2 {Further infiltration! White is simply not coordinated enough to scare her off, and now she controls some very dangerous squares. } 28. Ba4 {Countering with tempo. } Rc1 {The simplest way to hold the pawn. White cannot play 29.bxa5 without some suffering. } 29. Ree1 {Alternative variation: [The point is that] 29. bxa5 Qd2 [is very strong, e.g.] 30. Rxc1 ([ Also] 30. Ree1 Qxe1  31. Rxe1 Rxe1  32. Kh2 Neg4  33. hxg4 Nxg4  34. Kg3 Nxh6 35. Bxe8 Ra1 [leads to a won endgame for Black.]) 30... Qxc1  31. Kh2 Neg4  [ and Black wins the queen.] } Rxd1 30. Rxd1 Rb8 31. f4 {What else? White needs to find some activity, and now he finally threatens the pawn roller on e5 and removes the annoying threat of ...Neg4 . Alternative variation: [Still impossible is] 31. bxa5 [because] Qa2 [is very strong, e.g.] 32. Bc6 Rb1 [ and again the king doesn't really have an escape square given ...Neg4 ] 33. Rf1 Rxf1  34. Kxf1 Qc4  35. Ke1 Qc1  36. Ke2 Qc2  37. Ke3 [and now] Neg4  } Nc4 {Forced, but happily so. The knight is very strong here. Alternative variation: [Not] 31... Ned7 [since] 32. Bxd7 [wins] } 32. Kh1 {Essentially forced also. The looming ...Ne3 threatens mate on g2, and White has to defend somehow. There is still no time to pick up the a-pawn! Alternative variation: 32. bxa5 Ne3 [is forced mate] } Ne3 33. Rg1 {The point of Kh1 } Qxb4 {Finally Black has realized the long-term goal of the Benoni - the creation of a passed pawn on the queenside. With White's pieces tied up all over the board and the a4 bishop struggling for squares, Black has a very clear path to victory. The queen capture is most accurate, as the longer march down the a-file meshes much better with Black's pieces, and especially the queen who continues to ride the dark squares unopposed. } 34. Bd1 Qd4 {Surprisingly enough, this is a huge move. If Black is careless, White will actually crash through on h7. This move defends h8/g7, a1, and attacks the bishop on d1. The centralized Black queen is a sharp contrast to White's virtually entombed piece. Alternative variation: [The careless] 34... a4 35. f5 a3 [ (an obvious blunder, as ...Qd4 is still possible)] 36. fxg6 hxg6 37. Ne6 [ is now winning for White!] fxe6 38. Qxg6  Kh8 39. Qxf6  Kh7 40. Qf7  Kh8 41. Qh5  Kg7 42. Qg5  Kh7 43. Qxe3 [and its all over.] } 35. Be2 {Or else ...Nxd1 is decisive. } a4 36. f5 a3 37. fxg6 hxg6 {White resigned here, as the a-pawn is unstoppable and his kingside attack is going nowhere. Alternative variation: [ Significantly weaker is] 37... fxg6 [as White now has easy play with] 38. Ne6 [ threatening mate on g7 (or f8 if the rook leaves its post)] Qa7 39. Qf4 [ and the game is basically a draw.] }
