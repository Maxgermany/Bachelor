1. Nf3 {Flexible opening move.} d5 {Book.} 2. g3 {Aiming for the KIA (King's Indian Attack).} c6 {Aiming for a Caro-Kann setup against the King's Indian formation: [See comment]} 3. Bg2 Nd7 4. d3 e5 5. O-O Ngf6 {Completing the setup} 6. Na3 {? The knight is out of play here and can't return easily because b5 and c4 are guarded. Better would be 6.Nbd2 to prepare 7.e4.} Bd6 {This is my setup.} 7. c4 {I'd like a strong player to comment on whether the e4 break is a better plan here.} d4 {7...dxc4 would open up the center when behind in development, and allowing 8.cxd5 would do the same thing and make the central pawns weak. Now my plan is to castle kingside, play ...Re8, and prepare ...e4.} 8. Nc2 {8.Nb1 is better. The knight is dead here.} a5 {This move was played to take b4 away from the c2 knight and prepare a safe square on c5 for the d7 knight. ...Nc5 will allow development of the c8-bishop and support an ...e4 break.} 9. Bd2 Nc5 {Here I was thinking about 10.b4 and concluded that the open files after 10. b4 axb4 N/Bxb4 would favor me.} 10. e3 {?! This leaves the d3 pawn en prise, but it also threatens exd4, which in turn threatens dxe5 fork. I spent 15 minutes on this move. I was looking at 10...Nxd3 11. exd4 Nxb2 12. Qc1 (12. Qe2 e4) Nxc4 13. dxe5, and it didn't look good. Then I found 10...Nxd3 11. exd4 e4!? which is unclear. NM Heisman teaches "always choose unclear over equal so you can learn something." I chose unclear and won.} Nxd3 11. exd4 e4 {!} 12. Nfe1 {I was expecting Re1 or Ng5 here. The text move looks passive.} Bg4 {Developing with tempo.} 13. Qb1 {? I think 13. f3 was best, then after some trades, white's d4 pawn is weak, but the game is equal.} Be2 {Wins the exchange.} 14. Nxd3 exd3 {? I overlooked White's next move. I thought the attack on c2 would win the exchange.} 15. Re1 O-O {With the threat of 16...dxc2.} 16. Ne3 Re8 {Planning ...Ng4 or ...Ne4 in combination with ...Qf6. I have to take advantage of white's weak f2 pawn before the advanced pawn on d3 becomes a liability.} 17. c5 {? After my next move, the position is the same, except that now the d4-pawn is en prise.} Bc7 18. Nc4 {? Unsafe and, when 18...Qxd4 is played, there is also an attack on the f2 pawn.} Qxd4 19. Nb6 {? This allows ...Ng4 with a strong attack. 19.Ne3 is much better to block the attack on the f2-pawn.} Bxb6 20. cxb6 Ng4 {! There is no good way to meet the threat of ...Qxf2+.} 21. Be3 {? This move loses a piece. Better was to lose a pawn.} Rxe3 {! The rook cannot be taken. If it is, I win immediately.} 22. fxe3 {?? White is already down a piece if fxe3 is not played, but this ends the game.} Qxe3+ { } 23. Kh1 { } Nf2+ { } 24. Kg1 { } Nh3+ { } 25. Kh1 { } Qg1+ {! Queen sacrifice.} 26. Rxg1 Nf2# {Checkmate. I hope you liked the sacrifices.}
