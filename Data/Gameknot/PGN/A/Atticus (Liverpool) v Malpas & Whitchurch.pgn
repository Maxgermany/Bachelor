[Opening "Nimzo-Indian (E47), 4.e3 O-O, 5.Bd3"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {So it starts as a Nimzo-Indian. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence} 4. e3 {I enter the Rubinstein system. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence#Rubinstein_System:_4.e3} O-O {He continues with the Main Line.} 5. Bd3 {Preparing to bring my Ng1 to e2.} c5 {He strikes at my centre.} 6. Nge2 {I continue with my plan.} d5 {He makes another central advance. This is similar to another recent game I played, against the lovely penelope80, but in that game she played d5 earlier, so I didn't have to worry about black doubling my c pawns with BxNc3 as I could always undouble the pawns by exchanging on d5, and so I was able to develop my Ng1 to the more active square of f3. For this reason, I think the move order played by Mike Williams is better. http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/real-time-game?gm=61234} 7. a3 {So I hit his bishop.} Bxc3+ {He takes with check. I thought long and hard about which piece to recapture with here. Eventually I played......} 8. Nxc3 {This seemed better as to not have doubled pawns. In fact I found out later that taking back with the b pawn is more popular. I may well try that if I reach this position again.} Nc6 {He is now threatening exchanges ending up with him winning a pawn on d4. This seems to me to be a strong developing move, but in fact in the opening databases I have, black has played 8....cxd4 here.} 9. dxc5 {So I take.} dxc4 {He exchanges.} 10. Bxc4 {I take back.} Qa5 {I did now consider an exchange sacrifice. 11. b4 Nxb4 12. axb4 Qxa1 13. Qc2 and I am threatening to trap his queen with 0-0 and Bb2. Unfortunately he has 13.....Nd5! with advantage to black. So instead I played a more obvious move....} 11. O-O {This of course!} Qxc5 {He takes back.} 12. Qe2 {I protect the bishop.} Ne5 {He attacks it again.} 13. Ba2 {Bishop drops back. Although white is now confined to the back three ranks, white can now develop with tempo, attacking the black queen, and black's advanced knight can also be driven back with gain of time, if necessary. I think white has a small edge.} Rd8 {This looks good, but doesn't lead to much.} 14. e4 {Preparing to develop Bc1. If now 14....Nd3? 15. Rd1 and the Nd3 is pinned and lost (I have Bb1 attacking the knight again if necessary).} Bd7 {So he develops his bishop.} 15. Be3 {I attack the queen, as per my plan.} Qc7 {Queen drops back.} 16. Bf4 {I pin the knight.} Bc6 {Bishop moves to a more active square.} 17. Rac1 {With a half-pin on the c file.} Rac8 {He also completes his development. OK stop. Bearing in mind white wants to win this game, what do you think is the best move for white?} 18. Nd5 {Did you consider this move? I don't think it leads to advantage for white, but it causes black problems, which thankfully my opponent did not meet in the best way. I also considered 18. Nb5, but realised it is easily met by Bxb5 19. Qxb5 Nf3+ 20. gxf3 Qxf4 with advantage to Black. Computer seems to prefer 18. b4.} exd5 {So he takes.} 19. exd5 {I take back, threatening the Ne5 and the Bc6.} Nxd5 {He takes the pawn. OK, I can take the Ne5 with Bishop or Queen. Which would you chose and why?} 20. Bxe5 {Of course! Qxe5 loses to Nxf4! At the time, and during the post match post mortem, I liked Re8 here - I thought it drew for black after, say Re8 21.	Bxc7	Rxe2 22. Bxd5 Bxd5 23. Be5 and black can't take the Be5 as his own back rank is weak, and this seems a very drawish opposite coloured bishop ending. However, computer prefers the move Black actually played, and prefers White after 20.....Re8 21. Re1!} Qe7 {So, as I said, this may be the best move for Black. } 21. Rfe1 {I support my bishop, preparing a queen move.} Nb6 {I think this is a terrible move, decentralising his knight.} 22. Qg4 {Threatening both the queen, but also a discovered attack on the queen, for instance if g6 then 23. Bb8 wins the a pawn. } Qf8 {So this is more or less forced.} 23. Bb1 {With the threat of 24. Qf5, forcing g6, when 25. Qf6 mates.} g6 {Stopping that threat.} 24. h4 {Played to weaken up the Black king side. For instance if I can play h4-h5 I am threatening to exchange on g6 and then play a winning bishop sacrifice on g6. If now 24.....h5 then 25. Qg5 and again, I am threatening a winning bishop sacrifice on g6. I think his best defence now is Qh6, but thankfully for me, that was not forthcoming. } Bd7 {He attacked my queen. This is probably a losing mistake.} 25. Qg5 {Now I am also threatening Qf6 and mates. Qf3 was also strong. Nd5 had to be played, but white is much better.} f5 {And this is a major error. What should white play now?} 26. Ba2+ {Did you find it?} Nc4 {What is best now?} 27. Rxc4 {Bxc4 also wins of course, but this is quicker.} Be6 {What else?} 28. Rxc8 {And Black resigns.
