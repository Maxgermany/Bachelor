[Opening "Bird's opening (A03), Lasker variation"]

1. f4 {(game info on previous page) Bird's opening (A03) named after the 19th century English master Henry Bird, probably just comes outside the bracket of the most popular opening moves: e4, d4, c4, Nf3 and g3.  They all try and contribute to control of the Centre (Nf3 and g2 in a more hyper-modern way), but Bird is less popular than The English (c4) because it weakens WT's King-Side and WT has to watch that fools mate diagonal (e1-h4).  Bent Larsen however used it to good effect. Comment from yanov (1817):  if you look to statistics, black won more games than white, in all variations Comment from me:  Yes, I don't particularly like it.  } d5 {Standard kind of reversed dutch defence (1. d4 f5), controls 2 central squares and releases my LSB.  Another interesting option in the database was e5: The From Gambit, where White will have to play accurately to put out the flame in blacks attack. Comment from charleshiggie (1937):  Perhaps, in case anyone is wondering, I should point out LSB = Light Squared Bishop and DSB = Dark Squared Bishop. The author also uses WT = white Comment from me:  OK, sorry I thought it was pretty self explanatory. I'll explain that in any future annotations.} 2. Nf3 {Also standard.  Develops, clears K-Side for castling and takes part in the fight for control of the centre.} Nf6 {Ditto.. } 3. e3 {Releases his LSB, however his DSB is now cramped because of the dark square pawn chain on d2, e3 and f4.  This shouldn't be a problem however should he choose to play a fianchetto with b3 and Bb2.  However with me planning to fianchetto my Bishop along the same diagonal, I heard somewhere that the K-Side Bishop usually gains control of the diagonal when opposed by a Q-Side Bishop along the same diagonal.  Not sure if that's true though. Comment from yanov (1817):  anyway, this construction is very passive -- white must play b3 rapidly Comment from me:  I don't see this as too bad.  } g6 4. Be2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O {Even Stevens.. Comment from just_some_guy (1303):  i actually think black is a tiny bit better here he has more open pieces his dsb is only blocked at the moment his lsd has a 5 square attack d=radius at the moment his queen has a 3 square, but white's q and lsd have 1 and 0 squares respectablly. Comment from me:  True, hard to make anything from these minuscule advantages yet though. } 6. d3 {Using a hedgehog-type system, aiming to strike out at the centre after careful preparation.  Which is solid, but as you can see at this moment his Bishops are slightly cramped. } c5 {All moves which aim to gain control of the centre (the centre being the most important area of the the board, because that's usually where all the action will take place).} 7. c3 {Dubious?  To me slightly passive, and takes away c3: the best development square for the Knight.  But the Knight is good on d2 as well, as it prepares both e4 and c4 advances.  I was encouraged at this point by my opponents arguably tentative moves.} Nc6 8. h3 {Logical, prevents intrusion onto g4.  chess_o must complete development quickly though, he hasn't kept the initiative well given to White on the 1st move IMHO. Comment from just_some_guy (1303):  yes but while black is developing pieces white is moving pawns, 4 in a row at the moment. Comment from me:  Good observation, I hadn't noticed it.} Qc7 {Preparing e5. Comment from yanov (1817):  yes this is a good move, even if white have not developped fully. Comment from me:  Thanks, but not really, pretty simple logic behind it.} 9. Nbd2 e5 {A problem with K-Side fianchettos is that such pawns as f4 can advance eventually to f5 and cause problems.  e5 gains space and gets rid of the problem. Comment from yanov (1817):  this is not a problem there, as black fully controls f5 Comment from me:  Yes, it can become a pest in the future however. } 10. fxe5 {Position about = Comment from bobdoleeatsfood (1144): I would disagree. White is cramped and black controls the center ad is more developed. I'd give a slight edge to black here. Comment from me: Yes, I was probably wrong in that statement. You are right, I am better here.} Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Qxe5 12. Nf3 Qg3 {Threatens Bxh3 and WT cannot take because of the pin.  Maybe I have the slight edge here.} 13. Qe1 {Best move available.} Nh5 {So I can recapture on g3 with my Knight, forking f1 and e2 and getting the trade Bishop for Knight (Bishops considered more mobile on a fairly open board such as this 1).} 14. Qxg3 {Seems like the only option, but Fritz 9 recommends Bd1!?- Keeping hold of the Bishop pair and allowing it to become more active by coming to b3 (14. Bd1 Bxh3 15. Qxg3 Nxg3 16. gxh3 Nxf1 17. Kxf1etc..)} Nxg3 15. Rf2 Nxe2+ 16. Rxe2 Bf5 17. e4 {Best.  d4 creates a backward e-pawn and allows my B domination of the WT central squares. Comment from yanov (1817):  i agree but from the beginning, white are strategically lost} Rfe8 {Pinning e4.} 18. g4 {Trying to shift my Bishop, however I have other ideas..  Fritz 9 recommends the line: 18. Bf4 dxe4 19. R(a)e1 Rd8 20. dxe4 Be6etc..} dxe4 19. Ng5 {? 19. Kf2 exf3 20. Rxe8  Rxe8  21. gxf5 Re2  22. Kxf3etc..  Or even simpler Nd2, which achieves the same thing as Ng5, but prophylactically blocks the advance of my pawn on d3 once I've played exd3, hence stopping the following combination..   } exd3 {!!} 20. Rxe8+ {20. Re3 Rxe3 21. Bxe3etc..} Rxe8 21. gxf5 {Spells the end if it wasn't already.. Bf4 is the best from a bad bunch (21. Bf4 Bd7 22. Nf3 Re2etc..)} Re1+ {Making use of the pin, with a tempo check.} 22. Kf2 d2 {!It's all over!} 23. Bxd2 {Nothing else.} Rxa1 24. fxg6 hxg6 {Take with h7 to preserve my passed pawn.} 25. a3 {Ne4 is better for what it's worth (25. Ne4 Rxa2 26. Nxc5 Rxb2etc..) Comment from charleshiggie (1937):  Is Ne4 really better? The position is lost for White, but surely to give Black a passed a pawn is equivalent to resignation? Comment from me:  U are arguing with Fritz here not me! lol} Ra2 26. Ne4 Rxb2 27. Ke2 {Ke1 achieves the same thing, but moves out of the pin.  Comment from Charleshiggie (1937):  Surely Ke3 is the most stubborn defence? moving the king to a more active square, but avoiding the pin which forces resignation soon. Comment from me:  No 27. Ke3 Bh6  and that's my simplification done, I can get rid of Knight & Bishop.} f5 {(28. Nxc5 Bxc3 or 28. Ng3 Bxc3 29. Nf1 Bxd2 (although because of the pin there's no hurry) 30. Nxd2 Rxd2 31. Kxd2 and I have a won ending with 2 passed pawns to the good) Hope you enjoyed the game.}
