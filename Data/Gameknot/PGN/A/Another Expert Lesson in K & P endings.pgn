1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Just finished this little unrated game against my Expert buddy Dave.  I first got to play Dave in IM Beafyness's mini-tournament.  I got canned by him as black but managed to make a battle of it in "A Mating Attack Gone Wrong" as white.  Well, things went quite a bit wrong here.  In trying to undouble my pawns I overlooked a rook fork and lost a pawn.  In order to avoid further damage I had to exchange down to a K & P ending which I have stressed over and over again is SCUICIDE!  However, in this case I decided to play on because I had a queenside pawn majority.  My plan nearly worked but guess what, I blundered again and got taught yet another lesson, anyhow, back to the beginning - Dave decides to give me the Caro-Kann Defense after I kicked off with 1. e4.  } c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 {4. c4 - the Panov-Botvinik attack of the Caro-Kann Exchange Variation.} Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Nf3 {6. Nf3 - development.} Bg4 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Qb3 {8. Qb3 - the main line.} Bxf3 9. gxf3 {9. gxf3 - this knight for bishop trade has resulted in my kingside pawns being busted.} e6 10. Qxb7 Nxd4 11. Bb5+ Nxb5 12. Qc6+ Ke7 13. Qxb5 {13. Qxb5 - regaining my piece.} Qd7 14. Nxd5+ Qxd5 15. Bg5+ {15. Bg5+ - still in the main line database, I chose this move because it develops Fou Lenoir with a tempo.} f6 16. Qxd5 exd5 {16. ........ Qxd5 - this leaves black with two queenside isolanis to compensate for my kingside pawn islands.} 17. Be3 Ke6 18. O-O-O {18. 0-0-0 - Dave and I thought that this was the best way forward.  Queenside castling in the endgame keeps Henry fairly close to the centre and centralises a rook.} Bb4 19. a3 Rac8+ 20. Kb1 Bc5 21. b4 {21. b4 - the error - this allows a bishop trade to straighten out my pawns but allows a rook fork on c3.  Dave had this to say: - "Yes, I wondered if you would fall into that one it was a bit sneaky of me, Re1 would have been better earlier with a pin on the bishop".   } Bxe3 22. fxe3 Rc3 23. Kb2 {23. Kb2 - I choose this move to keep my queenside pawns together.} Rxe3 24. Rde1 {24. Rde1 - allowing a rook trade which Dave said he was very happy with but I was concerned with damage limitation.} Rxe1 25. Rxe1+ Kd7 26. Re3 Re8 27. Rxe8 {27. Rxe8 - after a thought I decided to swap off the rooks and make use of my queenside pawn majority.  It would have worked but ......} Kxe8 28. Kc3 Kd7 29. Kd4 {29. Kd4?? - question mark and double question mark.  Dave pointed out in the post-match pm that I should have played b5 here to have prevented Kc6.  My plan may well have worked if I had got my move order right.  Automatic centralisation of your king does not always work.} Kc6 30. a4 h5 31. b5+ {31. b5+ - two moves too late.} Kb6 32. Kxd5 Ka5 33. Kc6 Kxa4 34. b6 axb6 35. Kxb6 {35. Kxb6 - the queenside pawns have been liquidated but I am lost - you will see just how over the next few moves.} Kb4 36. Kc6 Kc4 37. Kd6 Kd4 38. Ke6 {38. Ke6 - Henry tries to get over to the kingside as quickly as possible, but his opposite number will pip him at the post!} Ke3 39. Kf5 Kxf3 40. Kg6 Kg4 41. Kxg7 {41. Kxg7 - I give myself the satisfaction of removing the g7 pawn before waving the white flag!  There is no way I will be able to stop the f pawn from crowning.  A dismal end.} f5 {}
