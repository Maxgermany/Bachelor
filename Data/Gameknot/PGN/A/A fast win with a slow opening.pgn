[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C77), Anderssen variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez, an opening that can lead to very complicated positions. There's a lot of theory on it. It's known for its positional character, but there are also some tactical lines.} a6 {Black has lots of possibilities here, but this is by far the most played line.} 4. Ba4 {White also has the possibility of playing 4.Bxc6 dxc6, going into the exchange variation. (Note that 5.Nxe5?! is not very strong because Black wins his pawn back with 5...Qd4 and has a comfortable position)} Nf6 5. d3 {I hoped for 5.O-O so I could play the Open Ruy Lopez with 5...Nxe4 but unfortunately my opponent didn't allow that and instead wentfor a slow, positional approach.} b5 {I had to deal with the threat 6.Bxc6 dxc6 7.Nxe5 winning the e5 pawn, because I can't win back the pawn on e4 anymore. The other possibility is 5...d6 but I didn't like the idea of closing in my dark-squared bishop that way.} 6. Bb3 Bc5 {An active approach from Black.} 7. h3 {A new move in this position, but not an entirely new idea in this variation. It seems slow, but surely it has its merits. White can now play 8.Be3 without having to worry about 8...Ng4. White also has the long-term plan of an attack on the kingside and this pawn move gives white the possibility of moving the f3 Knight via h2 to g4.} O-O 8. O-O {Now we're back in the database.} d6 9. c3 {Preparing d4, providing the bishop with another diagonal on which it can maybe prove useful (the b1-h7 diagonal) and stopping any Black piece from moving to d4.} Bb7 10. Bg5 {A nasty pin. I don't know when to play ...h6. Any thoughts, should I play this as soon as possible or is this not necessary?} Na5 {Threatening to gain the bishop pair. White gets the open a file in return if he lets me exchange, but that's probably not what he wants as he seeks action on the other side of the board.} 11. Bc2 Bb6 {I saw that this move occurred in many games in this opening but was not sure what the exact idea was. I suppose it's played to provide Black with te option of playing ...c5 but I'm not sure if there are also other ideas behind this move. Does anyone have any suggestions? Anyway, I copied the idea from those other games because I was not sure what to do.} 12. Nbd2 {White brings his last minor piece into the game, although it doesn't have a great influence on the board at this moment. In many Ruy Lopez games, the b1 Knight goes to d2 and f1 to take part in the kingside attack via e3 or g3 and, if possible, f5.} h6 {I decided it was time to somewhat release the tension, but of course White doesn't exchange (he would give up the bishop pair and allow my Queen to get into the game).} 13. Bh4 c5 {I saw this move in other games but was not sure if it was good in this case. It does prevent d4 but on the other side it gives White the strong d5 square (he can't use it right now, but this may become a factor in the future) and also prevents Black from playing ...d5 himself. Maybe 13...c6 was preferable, to prepare ...d5. It does close in the light-square bishop for the moment, but that piece is biting on granite anyway.} 14. Nh2 {White starts serious action on the kingside. He now has an edge as Black doesn't have a clear plan.} Qe7 {? The first serious mistake. Black had to weaken his King's position by playing 14...g5 15.Bg3 to release the pin on his Knight because now White gets a large, probably even winning, advantage by playing 15.Ng4!, winning at least a pawn and weakening the Black King's position anyway.} 15. Ng4 {! There it is. Only now it became clear to me that I was in serious trouble.} Rac8 {? The last error, but it was already over. I was seeking for counterplay but I had to do something to defend, such as 15...Qe6.} 16. Bxf6 gxf6 {? Another mistake, I had to accept that I would be a piece down. Now White finishes it....} 17. Nxh6+ Kh8 {17...Kh7 makes no difference.} 18. Nf5 {! And I resigned. White threatens 19.Qg4! and mate on g7 (if I play ...Rg8 White can play Qh5#). There's nothing I can do but to give up my Queen to avoid this. A strong game by White who got a strong attack going when I didn't pay attention. I hope you enjoyed the annotation. Any comments would be appreciated.}
