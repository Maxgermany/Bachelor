1. e4 c5 2. c3 {Alapin's Variation.  The most popular responses  are 2... Nf6 and 2... d5 since it strikes at the undefended e-pawn, to which white cannot respond with the natural Nc3 as defense.} Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 Nc6 {Black delays cxd4.  In sound lines, black eventually gets the opportunity to play it, but I decide to deviate in order to take advantage of black's non-committal 4th move.} 5. c4 {Here's where my position could start to crumble; however, there are only two games in the world database and one game in the Gameknot database with this position, so my opponent is pretty much on his own when it comes to opening theory.  5... Qa5  and 5... Ndb4 are both good responses to this speculative pawn push.} Ndb4 {Well, so far so good for black.} 6. d5 Nxe5 {Looks like black can't continue on the best path.  The intentional pawn sacrifice will allow white large amounts of space, which provide free development and a half-open e-file to play with, which provides full compensation for the pawn.  A better response for black was 6... Nd4 taking the positional advantage instead of the material one.} 7. f4 Ng6 8. a3 {Trying to send both knights into uncomfortable positions.} Na6 {8... Qa5 is worth a try, forcing white to complete development on the queen side before the knight gets kicked.} 9. Nf3 d6 {Necessary before being able to attack white's center with the e6 push.  It also has the nice benefit of giving the light-square bishop some potential square to develop.} 10. Bd3 {Threatening to ruin black's king side with a capture on g6.  At this point, you can see how white's compensation is realized.  Black's pieces are tied down, struggling to develop, and his knights are more of liabilities than assets.} e6 11. dxe6 Qf6 {Giving the pawn back in order to keep a relatively stable king side.} 12. exf7+ Qxf7 13. O-O {More of an attacking move than a defensive one in this situation, and Ng5 becomes a real threat.  If (13... Be7 14. Ng5), capturing the knight seems like suicide with open e- and f-files against the uncastled king.  Better is to leave the Ng5 alone in this situation, but forget ideas about castling king side.  13... h6 with the idea of preventing Ng5 will eventually leave the black king stuck in the center after the simple 14. Re1 .  Possible continuations involve (14.... Be7 15. Qe2 Nf8 16. Nc3 Nc7) with a strong attack or (14... Ne7 15. Be4) simply restraining black's king and queen sides.} Be7 14. Ng5 Qf6 {Probably the correct plan.} 15. Nc3 {Surprisingly, this move prevents black from king-side castling, as the text will show.  } O-O {??  15...  Bf5 with the idea of queen-side castling holds better for black.  Castling into where all of white's pieces are directed loses on the spot.} 16. Nd5 {The queen-side knight springs into action.} Qd4+ {The only spot for the black queen... with tempo!} 17. Be3 {...sort of.  This move forces black to waste one very valuable tempo.} Qxb2 18. Nxe7+ {Black resigns.  (18... Nxe7 19. Bxh7  Kh8 20. Qh5) is overwhelming.}
