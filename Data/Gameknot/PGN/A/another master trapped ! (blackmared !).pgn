1. d4 {queen pawn in order to play blackmar gambit} d5 2. e4 {here we go !} dxe4 {blackmar accepted} 3. f3 {main line in order to develop g knight} exf3 4. Nxf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 {maine line in order to castle an and develop h rook on f colon for later} h6 {preventing Kg5, i could play Ke5, but this whould be to early and to easy for master ADA45} 6. O-O {let's be prudent better} e6 {anoiding treath on f7 and develop DSB} 7. Nc3 {developing but no plan } c6 {this looks strange because it blocks the b knight, some body help about his plan at this moment ?...} 8. b3 {in order to fianchetto my DSB and put pressure on king side} Be7 {just casteling. I was worried about a terrible plan but I see nothing coming ...} 9. Bb2 {fianchetto} b5 {ok this is not so serious, my LSB was useless anyway on c4 !} 10. Bd3 O-O 11. a4 {1 chance on 2 that he will advance on b4...} b4 {is not a problem i will bring my knight to the  king side in order to attack black castle} 12. Ne2 Bb7 {dangerous fianchetto, we are in similar situation !} 13. Nf4 {i feel that  i have something interesting to do in this way, but i still dont know what ! sorry for poor annotation, it was just to show the game} Nbd7 14. Qe1 {i tough  lot of time to do this move with is maybe not so good, the truth is that i was not able to find a way to attack honorably the black position. What would you do if you where me ? } Qc7 {little attack,i now know that Ada doesnt have much more plan against me, considering his level it's already a victory for me !} 15. Ne5 {now i'm about to have a plan : something like sacrifice the  e5 knight on f7 or g6 and then use the  f4 knight resting to fork some rook and queen, i must find the way, the good combination...} Bd6 16. Rd1 {i case of} Rad8 {Ada must think the same kind of philosophy ("in case of ...") !} 17. Nxf7 {fearless attack ! i should be more prudent playing with hight elo ...} Rxf7 {maybe would be better D8 E8 to prevent the fork on e5 ?} 18. Bg6 {LSB entering in the game} Re7 {now the fork comes anyway threatening the d8 rook and the queen!} 19. Nxe6 {great ! with this one I saved the honor !} Rxe6 20. Qxe6+ {i get back my points} Kh8 {now i have to find the mate } 21. Bc1 {i know the treat on h2, but there is nothing so serious coming after, and i need more power to attack the king castle resting} Bxh2+ 22. Kh1 {that all risk for the moment} Nf8 {now the better answer is to exchange the queen, it's becoming to dangerous} 23. Qf7 Qxf7 24. Bxf7 {here we are} Bd6 {now boring ending is coming. And this is not my strongest point...} 25. Rde1 {occupy the e colon, maybe i will have the opportunity to bring the rook on e8 with is protected with the LSB (of course not for the moment there is a black rook and the knight...)} Nf8h7 26. Bd2 {i dont remember why this, maybe just because i didn't knew what to do, sorry for poor comments !} Ng5 {good opportunity to occupyg6 with my LSB,and blocking the king which is a good first step to mate} 27. Bxg5 {I did not know what to do with this bishop ! o good opportunity to give him some job ! and it will open the h colon, it could help if i can bring a rook there } hxg5 {and there is 2 black pawns blocked by one white !} 28. Bg6 {king blocked} Ba6 {opportunity to move to the h colon} 29. Rf3 Bf4 30. g3 {this was a mistake from me considering my plan to bring the rook to the h colon !} Bd2 {another opportunity to go on playing MY game !} 31. Re7 {and sorry guys, that's all folks for to day, Ada45 loose because TIMEOUT ! he should be very worried to forget time ! I hope you had enjoyed this game and you will give it a good rate !}
