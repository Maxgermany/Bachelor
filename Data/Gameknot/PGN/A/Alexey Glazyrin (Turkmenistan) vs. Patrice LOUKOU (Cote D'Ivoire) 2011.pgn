1. e4 {So we get on the way! and as usually i started by moving my King's pawn froward to the middle ;)} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Be7 {I think it's a not good move, if 4... , Nf6    Black's black bishop can only control it's right hand side, which is not so important at the moment.} 4. d3 {Development ...} h6 {this move i think is just a waste, he'd better develop his Queen's pawn, couldn't he?} 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Be3 {Now i think i have more advantage in the middle} d6 7. O-O b6 8. d4 {I'm trying to start an attack} exd4 9. Nxd4 Nxd4 10. Bxd4 c5 {i'm losing my advantage move after move} 11. Bxf6 Bxf6 {now his bishop is active! :( } 12. Qh5 O-O {that was predictable } 13. Nd5 {i don't want to see his black bishop } Bb7 {my "e4" pawn is undefended...} 14. Nxf6+ {but i have one more move to solve the problem of undefended pawn, so Check it is} Qxf6 15. Bd5 {again exchange! } Bxd5 16. Qxd5 a5 17. Rfe1 Rab8 18. e5 {looking for some space} dxe5 19. Rxe5 Rbd8 {and the counterattack } 20. Qe4 Rd4 21. Qe2 Rfd8 {he doubles his rook! } 22. h3 {i think i had nothing to do else} Rd4d2 23. Qe4 Qxf2+ {after this move it took me a lot of time to think, and i found my opponents weakness, i need to get my rook to "e8", but how? let's first run out of checkmate} 24. Kh2 Qf6 25. c3 {"b2" pawn for free, in order to single his rooks} Rxb2 {he got it, that's what i wanted} 26. Rd1 {get it and you will lose!} Rxd1 {Yep! } 27. Re8# {Beautiful checkmate! isn't it?}
