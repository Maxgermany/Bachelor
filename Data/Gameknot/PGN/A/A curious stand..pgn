[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Torre attack"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bf4 c5 {This is my testing scheme against such white's asset. No theory behind, just the feeling (and some experience with the same asset with white pieces!)} 4. e3 cxd4 {Not sure it is recommendable, but I tried it. I'm sure it's pretty covered by theory.} 5. exd4 Qb6 {Asking questions (ah, the club jergon!) to b2.} 6. Qc1 {One of the less recommendable answers, because it makes me easy to develop and reach equality. No real threa on the black diagonal (not while the c pawn is mobile), but I have space to manouver. Now, if I lose time by freeing my lsb, maybe - just maybe - I miss the chance to cause him some problems. } Nc6 {Of course, if Be3, d5 and this B has to move again to become useful. } 7. c3 Nd5 {? I'm still dreaming of an attack on the black diag, so I make this lsb going out of the d2 coverage. But it was just a bad idea, since white can easily answer c4 - I'm giving him the occasion by allowing my N to be threatened. True is that in order to play it he has to play a3 first, and I can try the Qa5 attack where if b4, Nxb4, etc, since a3 is pinned to the R. } 8. Bg3 h6 {I didn't dare to play the Qa4-b4-Nxb4-cxb4-Bxb4+, not while d2 is still all that covered. } 9. Bd3 g5 {...so this is my "plan": to attack on the kingside (the original purpose of black's asset), but with the disadvantage of having the Q almost useless on b6, and my own Qside far from being able to develop. On the other side, white has more or less the same problem: he has to castle just under my advancing pawns, and his minor pieces can be harassed - soon or later. If I play d6, Bd7, o-o-o... he will do whatever he wants (like c4. Fortunately for me, he assumes that Nb4 is still very powerful, but he can easily move his lsb from d3, or play a3 and make c4 a threat.)} 10. O-O {Now, it was my chance. Unfortunately, g4-Nh4 kind of blocks my attack, and h4 was not possible due to Nxg5 (h4 but the lsb can move. I can get rid of it, yes, but not much more (I could see!). But now it's my chance to play the "wonderful"...} f5 {Noah's Ark in sight. If h3, f4, I'm not scared by Bg6+, Kd8.} 11. Be5 {I can exchange this B, sure, but I'll have in e5 a N, threatening to come to g6... I wasn't sure. These were time-consuming moments for both of us. } Rh7 {This pins my own f pawn, but I dont' have to move it necessarily. I'm doing this because I want to keep my R on th h column, in sight of a possible sacrifice (Nxg5). Moreover: I can play on this lsb by harassing it with d6, and It will be lost for white. In return, I'll have to waken my e6 pawn, which is very dangerous in this asset. The advantage of doing that: white, as far as I can see, is in no position to cause a serious threat on e6 in few moves. My lsb will become active without even having moved from his home square. My R is trapped, as his. A R on the 7Âºth will always help my K...} 12. Re1 d6 {No risk, no win. I think I can hold e6. But I was wrong: now white has Bxf4, and if exB... Nxg5, hxN, Qxg4!?...} 13. Nxg5 {The sac! More time-consuming decisions...} hxg5 {No basis for the sac. He just helped me. I hope so, at least! True is that I will have to play carefully - not like my usual!} 14. Qxg5 {You have to be careful with things like Be7??, Qg8+, winning the R. } dxe5 {Here, white realizes that he has 1) b2 threatened, 2) if dxe5, it just opens a future line for my lsb and give action to my Q. 3) Rxe5 was just losing the exchange... so he thought it was smart to play...} 15. Be2 {...instead. He hopes in Bh5+, but I have a better move to play. } Nf4 {White is +4, but he is just too underdeveloped. His sacs were not well timed. The interesting part of this clumsy game is the center situation. Look at it... but now, black has serious threats, for example, Nxg2 (followed by Rg7)} 16. d5 {A desperado - and useless move. At this point, you may say black is just winning, and that the game is over. But another thing is to play it with less-than one minute on the clock (5 sec increment, but still...)} Rg7 17. Qh4 {I have to be careful. If Rxg2+, Kh1, Rxf7 (say), white has Bh5+, etc. If pieces are exchanged, my own caged pieces and exposed K may become a factor...} Nxg2 18. Bh5+ Kd7 {My escape route, as planned. My K will become exposed, but he has an escape route...} 19. dxc6+ Kc7 {! If Kxc6, Bf3+ and the game is over! But thanks to my R on g7, my K is safe for the moment. OF course, a direct cxb7, Bxb7 is winning. } 20. Qf6 {The best for the white Q. Now, with few seconds on the clock, I was so confused about how to take the best advantage of the position, that I made a fatal mistake. } Nxe1+ 21. Kf1 {...and now what? I feel I have missed the right combination. Here, Qxb2 seems decisive, since if KxN, Rg1#. BUT white has Qxe4+, and I can't play Bd6 or QxR... and if Kxc6, Be8+... AAAghh!!!} Qb5+ {I sacced the N, but defending e5, just in case. I didn't see Be2, but if played, Rg1+, KxR, QxBe2, threatening mate on g2, and with Nc2 as a "plus" in case all goes wrong...} 22. Kxe1 Rg1+ 23. Kd2 Qd5+ {?? It was very few time, and I missed the winner. Anyway, this should be winning... if I keep my mind together!} 24. Kc2 Qe4+ 25. Kb3 {...and now I can't see how to continue the attack. True, I can take the Nb1, I can risk something like a5, but he can now give me check on f7, and he can take my Bf8... too risky! I can still lose this!} Rg8 {?? It was so simple to play Bc4... :-(} 26. Qf7+ Kxc6 27. Qxg8 Qd5+ {Sob! Material is even again - but the position is still thrilling. Now I tried to win some time with silly checks.} 28. Kc2 Qe4+ 29. Kd2 Qf4+ 30. Ke1 {? My plan is to make him land on a black square, or something, so to save my B and prevent him to harass my K. Yes, I can win the Ra1 (Qc1+, Ke2, Qxb2+, K moves, QxR), but this leaves my B and my K in a very difficult position - or, at least, I assumed it was! So...} Bc5 {I can see no mate, and he has to take care of f2.} 31. Qg3 {Curiousely, if I exchange Q, he will have the same chances as me. I have lost too much, I have to accept my fail, and get to recover the material while I can. } Qc1+ 32. Bd1 Qxb2 33. Nd2 Qxa1 {Now: I am a R up, but my pieces are still pinned in its initial squares... so my extra R is not really playing. And both K so exposed... is this a crazy game?} 34. Qxe5 {Seconds on the clock. I can't lose this by time. Bd6 was easy, but I needed simplification...} Bxf2+ 35. Kxf2 Qxd1 36. Nc4 {My wonderful lsb holds all my position... from his initial square!} Qc2+ 37. Kg3 {? He was with seconds, too...} Qd3+ 38. Kf4 Qxc4+ 39. Kg5 Qg4+ 40. Kf6 Qh4+ 41. Kf7 Qh7+ {...hoping in..} 42. Kf6 {?? } Qh8+ {It was not a great game, from both sides. But I kept on and managed to save a difficult game (after a sound blunder!), and stressed him too much to the end. }
