[Opening "Vienna game, Max Lange defence (C25)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {The Vienna Game -- a quiet opening, whose strength often lies in the very fact that it attacks nothing -- quite often black will go for too much in an opening like this.} Nc6 {2. ...Nf6 is more common, but this is good as well, and has the bonus that if white plays 3. f4, there is no cumbersome knight on f6 to prevent black from playing exf4 followed by Qh4 .} 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 Na5 {?!  This is an unusual move here.  While it's good to win the bishop pair, this is a slow move for black.  White will continue to develop while it costs black three knight moves to exchange white's "bad" bishop.  In return, black gets the bishop pair and doubles white's pawns.} 5. Nge2 {Continuing to develop, aiming for an f4 push.} g6 {An interesting move here.  I don't think it's very good, as the pawn on e5 will certainly hamper the Bg7.  Perhaps d6 was the move to be made here, giving the Bc8 some scope, or possibly h6, preventing Bg5.} 6. Bg5 {!  This is an excellent response to g6, as this pin is even stronger than it would've been with a pawn on g7.} Bg7 {Consistent, and it allows the queen to move away from the knight's protection.} 7. f4 {If white can play fxe5 unhindered, he'll win a piece with Bxf6.} Nxc4 {Of course.} 8. dxc4 {An important recapture -- not only is white still threatening fxe5, but he now has commanding control of d5 as well as a half-open d-file to wreak havoc upon.  fxe5 here would have been premature.} d6 {Necessary in order to recapture after fxe5.  Qe7 fails to Nd5!, where black loses a piece.} 9. O-O {Good development, plus it adds another attacker to f6 after fxe5.} O-O {?  Black simply can't afford this; he had to try h6 immediately, as the buildup on the knight is too strong.  Now white embarks on a combination that wins a piece.} 10. fxe5 dxe5 11. Nd5 {!  The key move of the combination, as now the Nf6 is attacked three times and cannot be defended a third.  Capturing on d5 or e4 is impossible due to Bxd8, and so black has no choice but to play a piece down.} h6 {I suppose black was hoping for 12. Nxh6  Kh8 13. Bh4 g5 14. Bg3 Bxf6, but there would have to be a few dubious (i.e., ?) moves by white to allow that.} 12. Bxf6 {The simplest way to win a piece.} Bxf6 13. Nxf6+ Kg7 {I prefer Kh8 here, for reasons that will become apparent later.  Black is lost here, but the way white wins the game is a lot of fun.} 14. Nc3 {No need to exchange queens -- black can do it if he likes and give white the open file.  This centralizing move gives white the ability to play Ncd5.} Qe7 {Aiming for Rd8, but again, this is simply too slow.} 15. Ncd5 {Hitting the queen; perhaps c6 or Be6 would have been better for black last move, keeping the knight out of d5 for a little while.} Qd6 {The queen was forced to move, and black chose the d6 square, which appears to be reasonable.  Note something, though.  If there were no Rf8, white could play Ne8 , winning the queen.  There is a rook on f8, but that doesn't mean everything...} 16. Qf3 {...because if there were no knight on f6, and the rook were on e8 instead of f8, well, couldn't the queen-rook battery down the f-file win the game for white?} c6 {??  Loses immediately.  Black needed to connect his rooks with a move like Bd7 or Be6 (relatively the best move).  Now white gets to play the tactic I just told you about:} 17. Ne8+ {!  Rxe8 loses the game; K-moves loses the queen.} Rxe8 {Allowing the pretty combination.} 18. Qxf7+ {Forcing the king to h8.} Kh8 {The only legal move.} 19. Qxe8+ {Black can delay mate by another move by giving up his queen on f8, but either way, he gets mated in his kingside corner.} Kh7 {or Kg7 20. Rf7#} 20. Rf7# {1-0.  Thanks to bayshoremarauder for playing this one out -- and damn, what a pretty tactic Ne8  turned out to be!  Hope you enjoyed it!}
