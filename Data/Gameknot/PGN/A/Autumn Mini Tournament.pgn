1. e4 {By creating this, I am hoping to learn some better moves from the veteren players and showing off a mediocre win against a player under 1000. It's been a while since I last played on gameknot....} d5 {I don't like these openings. I am not comfortable with this opening. } 2. Qe2 {My method for chess at the moment is to try to get as many pieces as I can. This may not work so well in higher chess matches, but it tends to work decently in the lower leagues. This move is an attempt to save my pawn, if he chooses to take it. } c6 {What is he trying to do here? Does he have a simular tactic as me? } 3. d3 {I knew that the right side of my board was covered by a row of pawns...it would be hard to try to attack in that situation. } g6 {This move eventually costed him dearly when he had the momentum. I assume he is trying to take out his bishop, but I like the e4 move better. } 4. h3 {I've seen this used many times, and I thought I'd give it a try. This makes it hard for bishops (mostly) and other pieces to get close to the main part of my "fleet". } Bg7 {I saw this one coming. } 5. Nc3 {This was a multi purpose move. It prevented that bishop from ever coming near my rook, and protected the pawn above the queen. } d4 {Things went downhill from here. } 6. Na4 {I didn't think it would be wise to move my knight back to where it came from. The only other logical choice was here. Unfortunatly, my lack of vision cost me. } Qa5+ {I don't like falling behind with pieces in chess matches. This made me very upset at myself. } 7. c3 {Was this the right thing to do? I wanted to try to gain a pawn after losing a knight to try to make the "score" more even. But I'm not sure if I saw that bishop. } Qxa4 {Anticipated move. } 8. b3 {I wanted to be on the offensive. I wanted vengence in the form of chess pieces...} Qa6 {An expected move. } 9. cxd4 {As I said before, I wanted to gain back some pieces to even our score. } Bxd4 {This is where I actually started thinking. You see now that the bishop is not protected. If I move my bishop to the spot diagnal to the rook, I could scare it off and take down the rook. That would easily make up the loss. } 10. Bb2 {Done. } Bxb2 {It just depended on weather or not he cared about leaving his bishop alive, or saw my tactic.} 11. Qxb2 {Only logical move that I can see in the situation.} b5 {I don't understand this. He appeared to have seen my tactic before, but now he seems oblivous to the fact I can still take it down. Perhaps he didn't see my move before, or wasn't paying attention this time around? } 12. Qxh8 {I clap my hands. } Kf8 {A good move in the circumstance. That knight is saved. } 13. Qxh7 {I am a player for pieces. Pawns count too. } c5 {Is it a good time to develop after major blows have been struck? } 14. Nf3 {It's a easy mate I'm trying to build up to, as the knight will support the queen in checkmate. I was fairly sure he would see it, but he had been oblivious in the past. } Qf6 {If I wasn't paying attention, I may have had to take a taste of my own medicine. } 15. e5 {The pawn stops the queens attack, and further brings more pieces on my attack on the king. This pawn actually helped me get the mate.} Qf5 {Would you have moved here?} 16. Be2 {I was planning to move that pawn (diagnal to the rook) to scare of the queen from the area of my king. I needed something to protect the knight though. I liked this because I made him think I was castleing when in reality I was not. } Nc6 {The pawn is safe as long as the queen is in trouble. } 17. g4 {My move I was planning for...} Qf4 {This is a tough spot. I have no pieces able to threaten the queen. } 18. O-O {Well well...I castled after all. My king is now much safer. } Nxe5 {I did a poor job preparing for this. } 19. Nxe5 {I didn't want a knight helping the queen get a mate. He was too close. I had to destroy it. } Qxe5 {I think this was easy to predict. } 20. Rae1 {I could use my strategy from earlier in the game and take another rook. } Qd5 {He sees it. He finally learned his lesson. But, I would have moved that bishop instead. That queen situated in front of a rook is not a good idea. } 21. f4 {All I need to do is move the bishop (with the rook protecting) and I've got a rook. } e6 {He is defending his queen. Why would he do this? Why would his queen need protection? } 22. Bf3 {I have him again. I've used this tactic many times throughout the game, sometimes failing and other times succeeding. My opponent is very inconsistent.} Qxd3 {He made the best decision given the time. A pawn is a gain. } 23. Bxa8 {Success. } Ba6 {I assume he wants to move the pawn diagnal the bishop, move the queen, put my king in check and take the rook. When one uses a move very often, they aren't likely to be fooled by it. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me, especially at this stage. } 24. Red1 {I'm not scared of the queen putting me in check if it moves directly vertical to the king.. All I need to do is move one space to the right and the bishop (at the other side of the board) will support my position. Too bad black was too late to move his pawn out of the way for his bishop to take my rook. And look! I can get his king in check once the queen moves out of the way! } Qe3+ {The expected check. } 25. Rf2 {This was the form of check I was not expecting. I suppose I should have been more prepared for this move. This puts the rook out of the black bishop's danger. } b4 {Too bad he is too late to make a legitamite attack on my bishop. At the very least, it gives black's queen some support. } 26. Rd8+ {I smell a checkmate. } Ke7 {I thought this over a bit, and the best move was to take the knight. } 27. Qxg8 {By doing this, the rook is protected and I've taken down yet another value piece. } Kf6 {Thinking back on it, was this the correct time to move his king, or should he try attempt a last chance attempt on my king? } 28. g5+ {Do you not remember the pawn I talked about? It forms support for the other pawn to strike. And the king can only move to two spaces...both checkmate. } Kf5 {He chooses the path through the pawns. This is not as ovious a mate if he were to move toward my rook. There was nothing else he could do. } 29. Qxf7# {Checkmate. My opponent was good at times, but he was inconsistent in his defenses. I will have to play him again this mini tournament, and I know what moves I'll be maing. Please tell me your opinions on the game, and better moves to make in the future. Thanks for your help.  }
