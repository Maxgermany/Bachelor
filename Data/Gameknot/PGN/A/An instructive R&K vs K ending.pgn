[Opening "Scandinavian defence (B01)"]

1. e4 {My opponent played well, but in the end played for a draw when a win was inevitable for White in a R&K vs. K ending.  The strategy will be explained when we get down to R&K vs. K. As a B/C player, I stick to a few openings, only experimenting when playing against players that I know I dominate.  Here, I chose my standard Scandinavian.  The idea is to challenge White from the very first move.  } d5 2. exd5 {Black is a pawn down, but gets a little lead in development.  The gambit of the pawn is temporary.} Nf6 {The Modern Variation.  Jack Peters, the IM and LA Times Chess columnist, taught me this opening in a series of private lessons.  } 3. Bb5+ {White develops with check.  It is a book move.} Bd7 4. Bxd7+ {This, though, is bad.  White has made two moves with a piece that is now about to vanish from play.  A waste of time.  After Black retakes, he'll have two pieces developed to White's none.} Nbxd7 5. Nc3 Nb6 6. d3 {I'm pretty sure a master would find fault with these moves.  But Black is wanting to recapture the piece and control the center.  Black also worries a bit about getting castled.} Nbxd5 7. Nf3 Nxc3 {Black makes this move to give his opponent an ugly pawn formation.  The isolated a pawn and the doubled c pawns are liabilities that can provide dividends in the end game.} 8. bxc3 e6 9. O-O Bd6 10. h3 {This looks like a wasted move.  "Every tempi counts!" Jack Peters would say.  Black had no threat to occupy g4.} O-O {And Black is comfortable with a lead in development and a better pawn structure.  } 11. Re1 Nd5 {Nice spot for the Knight, if he can rest there a while.} 12. Bd2 Rc8 13. c4 Nf6 {Now maybe it is Black who has wasted a few moves.} 14. Bg5 Be7 {I like this move.  Comments anyone?} 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 {I didn't like White's move.} 16. Rb1 b6 17. Qd2 c5 {Black fixes the White pawns.} 18. Re4 Rc7 19. Rbe1 Rd7 20. Ne5 Bxe5 21. Re4xe5 Rd4 22. Re1e3 Rxc4 {Black takes advantage of White's mistake, and grabs a pawn.} 23. Rg3 Rh4 {I don't remember my thinking here.  Maybe it was to add a defender to the Kside?} 24. Reg5 g6 25. Qc3 Rd4 26. Qd2 Rd5 {Black is happy to exchange to an endgame.} 27. Rg3g4 h5 28. Rxd5 Qxd5 29. Rh4 Qxa2 30. Qg5 Qa1+ 31. Kh2 Qg7 32. Qe7 Qe5+ 33. g3 Qe2 34. Kg2 Qxc2 {White is playing poorly.} 35. Rxh5 Qxd3 {Black sees that if 35...gxh (PxR), White plays Qg5 and might draw by perpetual check.} 36. Rh4 Qd5+ 37. Kh2 Qd8 38. Qxa7 Qb8 39. Qa1 {White threatens mate at h8.} f6 40. Qb1 Kg7 41. Qb5 Rd8 42. Qb1 Qd6 43. Rg4 f5 44. Qb2+ e5 45. Ra4 Rd7 46. Ra8 Rb7 47. Qa2 {It's never easy.} Rf7 48. Qa4 f4 49. Qe4 fxg3+ 50. Kxg3 Qf6 51. f3 Qg5+ 52. Kf2 Qd2+ 53. Qe2 Qxe2+ 54. Kxe2 {It's an easy endgame.  } Rb7 55. Rc8 Kf7 56. Rc6 g5 57. Ke3 b5 58. Rxc5 Ke6 59. Ke4 b4 60. Rxe5+ Kf6 61. Rc5 b3 62. Rc6+ Kg7 63. Rc1 b2 64. Rb1 Kf6 65. Ke3 Rb3+ 66. Kf2 Ke5 67. Kg3 Kf5 68. h4 gxh4+ 69. Kxh4 Kf4 70. Kh3 Kxf3 71. Kh4 Ke2 72. Kg4 Kd2 73. Kf4 Kc2 74. Rf1 b1=Q 75. Rxb1 Rxb1 {Here White should have resigned.  But he thought he could get a draw by perpetual check or the 50 move rule.  Knowing how to close out an ending like this is chess 201.  (Chess goes all the way to infinity.)  The idea is to close off the King's squares, push him to the edge, get your own King in opposition.  As follows.} 76. Ke5 Rb4 {White can no longer move to ranks 1-4.  Important to note:  Black did not try for a check.} 77. Kd5 Kd3 {The Black King takes "the opposition" against the White King.  When the Kings are one rank apart, and on squares of the same color, as above, we have "Opposition."  The King that now has to move is at a big disadvantage, because retreat is the only move.} 78. Ke5 Rd4 {This remands the White King to 1/4 of the board.} 79. Kf5 Re4 80. Kf6 Kd4 81. Kf5 Kd5 82. Kf6 Re5 {Squeezing.} 83. Kf7 Re6 84. Kf8 Kd6 85. Kf7 Kd7 86. Kf8 Re7 {The desired position.  The White King is pinned against the edge of the board.  Any edge will do.  Now the finish is very easy.} 87. Kg8 Ke6 88. Kf8 Kf6 89. Kg8 Rf7 90. Kh8 Kg6 91. Kg8 Rf6 {and mate next move.}
