[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {The usual King's Pawn opening.  I am used to seeing this because 1.e4 is also my favorite opening.} c5 {This is the, "cornerstone" of the Sicilian Defense, and I like it better then the King's Pawn Game.  First, it prevents some of white's pieces from breaking through.  Second, it is more aggressive then 1...e5.  In other words, the Siclian Defense is more of an attack then a defense.  However, the King's Pawn Game is more of a defense then an attack.  Most importantly, white cannot get away with violating Opening General Principles if 1...c5 is played.  As Bobby Fisher would say, "Best by Test", but I do not know if that statement applies to opening principles.   } 2. Bc4 {?  This is his first blunder.  In this position, he is trying to get a, "Scholars Mate", but I am not going to let him mate me in four moves.  In addition, he has violated an opening principle because this does not give him a tactical advantage.  Therefore, he is supposed to develop his knight before the bishop.  To top it off, the game is unofficially lost.  This was not his loosing blunder, but I will be as aggressive as I can.  In other words, I will show no mercy, when he makes more blunders.  I generally defeat my opponents with their own mistakes, but that is especially true, in this game.  That is because I feel insulted when people attempt this dirty trick, especially a team game, even though I am not angry.  This attitude, however, is a blunder as it causes stubbornness and inflexibility.  On the other hand, it does not cost me, in this game.      } e6 {! At this point, I decide to transpose the Sicilian Defense into the French Defense, as a result, of his last move.  This is the proper response to an attempted, "Four Move Trick" because it reduces the bishops diagonal.  In addition, I am not going to show amnesty, as I had mentioned earlier.  } 3. Qh5 {? I am surprised that he made this move.  That is because it is no longer feasible to get a, "Scholars Mate", in this position, due to my last move.  BTW, I am referring to 2...e6.  However, this is also a blunder and another violation of Opening General Principles.  That is because you are not supposed to bring the queen out early, and this mistake will cause him problems, later in the game.  } Nf6 {! I decided to chase his queen, due to his last move.  Therefore, he has just wasted a tempo.} 4. Qf3 {That is because he is forced to retreat his queen immediately after he brings it out.} d5 {I made this move to chase his bishop away.  Therefore, he will be forced to retreat, "or so I thought", as they say.} 5. Bb5+ {However, that does not happen.  Instead, he places me in check, but I do not mind because it is a mere nuisance.} Bd7 {? In my opinion, 5...Nc7 might have been my best move.  If I had responded with my knight, I might not have been able to force an exchange, but it would have protected my LSB.  Afterall, I believe that this is an open position, if I am correct.  Therefore, the bishop is more powerful then the knight.  On the other hand, this was not my worst move because he will also loose a bishop.  As a result, the score will be even, when 6.Bxd7+, Nbxd7 are played.   } 6. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 7. Nc3 {I do not know why he chose this candidate because he cannot play 8.Nxd5, due to my e6 pawn.  In addition, he is not going to Fianchetto his DSB or castle queenside.  } Ne5 {! I made this move to chase his queen, again. } 8. Nb5 {?? I do not know why he chose this candidate, but this is his loosing blunder.  That is because I will exchange my knight for his queen, when 8...Nxf3+ 9.gxf3 are played.  Therefore, he will be six points behind and have two weak f pawns.  } Nxf3+ 9. gxf3 a6 {! I made this move to chase his knight.} 10. Nc3 {Therefore, he is forced to retreat it.   } d4 {! I chose this candidate to chase his knight, again.} 11. Nce2 {Therefore, he just lost a tempo because I force this retreat, and that was part of my strategy.  In other words, I wanted to take moves away from my opponent.  Once again, I do not have sympathy for him. } Bd6 {I made this move so that I can castle, and that will happen shortly.} 12. Nh3 {? I do not know why he chose this candidate, but, "a knight on the rim is grim", in general.  This was not an exception, so this will not benefit him.  In addition, I will castle on the Kingside with 12...0-0.} O-O 13. Nef4 {?? He made this move to exchange his knight with my bishop.  In most cases, the positions are open.  I am, btw, referring to open positions.  Therefore, bishops are generally worth more then knights.  This time, however, I will accept that exchange with 13...Bxf4 14.Nxf4.  I do not mind because I am still ahead.} Bxf4 14. Nxf4 Qd6 {! I chose this candidate to chase his knight away, but that will not happen, this time.  I originally thought that I had made a bad choice, but I was wrong.  That will be explained shortly.} 15. e5 {?? This is the reason that I thought 14...Qd6 was a blunder.  However, I forgot that this is a bigger blunder.  He chose this candidate to chase my queen away, but that will not happen.  Instead, I will win another free pawn with Qxe5+, so I will be seven points ahead, instead of, six.} Qxe5+ 16. Ne2 {! This was his best move.  In this position, he still has the chance to castle Kings side.  If 16.Kd1 or 16.Kf1, that chance would have been gone.} Qd5 {! I made this move for two important reasons.  First, I wanted to win his f3 pawn and play a powerful fork between his knight and rook.  Second, he would then be forced to castle or retreat his rook.  What will really happen?  That will be explained during the next couple of moves.   } 17. Nf4 {He chose this candidate to chase my queen away, but it does not matter what he plays.  That is because I will win his f3 pawn with 17.Qxf3, wherever he moves.  Therefore, I will be eight points ahead, as opposed to, seven. } Qxf3 18. Nxe6 {?? He made this move because he thought that he would win my e6 pawn.  In addition, he wanted to chase f8 rook away, but this turns out to be a very serious blunder.  That is because I will play 18...Qxh1+.  Therefore, I will win his h1 rook, and he will officially loose the chance to castle as he will be forced to play 19.Ke2.  Then, I will win his e6 knight, with 19...fxe6, so he will be 15 points behind.} Qxh1+ 19. Ke2 fxe6 20. b3 {He chose this candidate because he wanted to fianchetto his DSB and this brings him one step closer to doing that.} Ne4 {! This is solid, but I was not sure why I moved there, at first.  However, I made this move because it will bring me one step closer to a mating sequence with my knight, f8 rook, and queen.  This will be explained shortly.} 21. Bb2 {?? He chose this candidate to form the fianchetto, as I had mentioned earlier.  However, 21.Kd3 would have been his best move, as it would have avoided a mating threat.  At this point, however, I now have an inevitable mating pattern, and it is a mate in 3.  In other words, I will mate him in three moves with 21...Rxf2+ 22.Kd3 (forced), Rxd2+ 23.Kc4 (forced), b5#.  In fact, I created a chess puzzle, based on this game, and it was, btw, my last puzzle.  In the puzzle, I mentioned that I would annotate this game, at some point.} Rxf2+ 22. Kd3 Rxd2+ 23. Kc4 b5# {This opponent went on my, "bad list" when he attempted the, "Four Move Trick".  That is because I took offense when he attempted this dirty trick.  This is the reason that I showed my, "true color".  In addition, I-d-j would say, "If your opponent knows this trick, you will be worse after you have tried it". }
