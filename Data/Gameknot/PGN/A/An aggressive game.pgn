1. e4 {A standard opening, and I had a standard reply} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {here it seems like he wants to try the Ponziani opening I wasn't particulary too worried, about d4 because I could change the game into a guico piano} Nf6 {attacking e4} 4. d3 {defending the pawn and according to me, threathing to pin the knight} h6 {I didn't want the bishop to pin the knight} 5. Bd2 {I'm not sure what the objective of this move was, to me it seemed lke it blocked in the knight} a6 {I wanted to bring out my bishop to c5, and didn't want b4 followed by b3. I would have to move the knight, and it gave him a good start on a queenside attack} 6. Be2 {developing as well as preparing for a castle} Bc5 {My earlier plan} 7. Qc1 {I'm not sure why he did this move perhaps to sack his bishop once i castled and attack my king} d6 {I didn't want to risk a forthcoming attack, so i played a safe move} 8. h3 Be6 {Developing the bishop here i was starting to thionk about castling queenside} 9. Be3 Bxe3 10. Qxe3 d5 {I developed my plan here, I wanted to exchange pieces, move out my queen, and castle queenside } 11. Qc1 {Not sure why he did this move In the end he would lose a pawn} dxe4 12. dxe4 Nxe4 {Now I had an extra pawn} 13. O-O Nd6 {I don't believe this was the best move, but it isn't to shabby} 14. Nbd2 {developing pieces} Qf6 {opening up for a queenside castle I wanted to do a queenside castle, to  protect my king and to use the pawns on the kingside to attack the king } 15. Re1 {developing his rook to a powerful column, as well as setting up an attack on e5} e4 {I pushed the pawn forward to make the knight move Here I started getting aggressive} 16. Nh2 Qg5 {Attacking h3, and winning a second pawn This move started my attack} 17. Bg4 {a smart defensive move It blocked my attack, as well as attacking e4} f5 {bringing out my pawn in defense, as well as starting a pawn attack on the king} 18. Bd1 O-O-O {Finally! now my king is safe, and i can use both rooks to attack, and move out my knights} 19. Ba4 {not a very smart move he cant use Bg4 again...  Also it gives me the oppurtunity to bring my c6 knight into action} Ne5 {threathening the fork} 20. Re3 {this i also believe, wasn't the best move } f4 {Attacking the rook, and attacking h3.... I wasn't particulary worried about the attack on e4} 21. Rxe4 {A strange move I can see the defensive properties of this move, but he could have done a lot better I definitly believe this was the blunder that won me the game} Bxh3 {I ignored the rook for the moment  and threathened mate} 22. Qf1 {His best and safest method to stop the mate} Nxe4 {taking the rook} 23. Ndf3 {not sure whe he didn't take the knight but i believe he wanted to bring out the knight that was stuck on h2} Nxf3+ 24. Nxf3 Qa5 {hoping to exchange pieces} 25. Qc4 {protecting as well as starting a queenside attack} Bf5 {saving the bishop, protecting the knight, and threatheing the fork on b5} 26. Nd4 Qd5 {hoping to exchange queens, and stop his attack} 27. Qe2 c5 {making him move his knight } 28. Bb3 {Threatheing the queen} Qe5 {again hoping to exchange queens, } 29. Nxf5 Qxf5 30. f3 Rd2 {I realize now that this wasn't the best move  But i guess i wanted to get rid of the queen and use my rooks to try to win} 31. Qxe4 Qxe4 32. fxe4 Rxb2 33. Re1 {Hoping to promote.. } b5 {this was an atempt to block in the bishop and promote with my queenside pawns} 34. c4 {instead he blocked himself in} b4 {blocking the bishop in for the time being} 35. e5 {Pushing his pawn down} Kd7 {I was hoping to put my king on the e file, and block the advancing pawn, as well as bringing my king into the game} 36. e6+ Ke7 37. Re5 Rf8 {I agree, this was definitly not the best move In fact it nearly lost me the game} 38. Rxc5 Kxe6 39. Rc6+ Kd7 40. Rxa6 f3 {I wanted to bring my rook to the other side of the board and possibly promote this was definitly a foolhardy plan} 41. gxf3 Rxf3 42. Ra7+ {losing me another pawn} Kc6 43. Rxg7 Rf6 {Protecting another fork} 44. Rg8 {hoping to make me move my king, and do b5, to free his bishop as well as trying to promote the pawn} Kc5 {moving my king foward, blocking the c pawn from advancing} 45. Rc8+ Rc6 {protecting and hoping to exchange } 46. Rb8 {a good move} Rb6 {Here he could have tried to perpetual check me, but instead tried to go for the win} 47. Ra8 Rxb3 {The move that turned the game into my favor I spent nearly 30 minutes debating this move This move took care of his bishop, and gave me the chance to move my king and attack his vulnerable b3 pawn  Also, i had a pawn on h6 which i could easily use to make him move his pieces} 48. axb3 Kd4 {Carrying out my plan I wasn't particulary worried about the c pawn advancing, because i could position my rook so it would always attack it Also if he attempted protecting the b pawn with Ra1 and to b1, Kc2 would take care of that Also his king was to far away to help on the queenside attack, and i could always use the pawn on the h file to try to promote} 49. c5 Rb5 {threathing the pawn, as well prepearing to move my rook onto the c file  Also if the rook decided to attack the undefened h pawn, and then try to protect the white b pawn, then moving the rook to c3 would take care of that} 50. c6 {A useless attempt} Rc5 {Now I prevented the pawn from promoting, as well as stopping the king from getting past the c file} 51. Rc8 {Protecting} Kc3 {And now I can finally take the advantage} 52. c7 Kxb3 53. Kf2 {Another useless attempt to try to reach the pawn in time} Kc3 {I couldn't move the king to the a file, because then after a rook check, I would end up losing a rook, and possibly the game} 54. Ke2 b3 55. Kd1 b2 {Now the king couldn't move forward to attack the pawn he only had one option} 56. Rb8 Rxc7 {Now I could easily check the king, make him move, advance my king, and then promote it would be taken, and i would still have a second pawn, which would win me the game Realizing this he resigned.  I hope you have enjoyed this game, and i hope you will comment Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions or comments }
