1. e4 {At this point (looking at my opponents grade in comparison to mine) i was confident of a loss but i still took the challenge!} c5 {quite common- though i don't remember what this opening is called} 2. d4 {straight into the attack i decided, as i felt in a rather agressive mood that game} e6 {pretty defensive i would say} 3. d5 {i decided to push!} Nf6 {now black threatens the pawn which i'm using to defend my other pawn- what to do now??} 4. dxe6 {simply take the swap off} Nxe4 {that i thought was not that good a move on black's part, as it put the knight in a weak position} 5. exf7+ {now i can play my pawn in black's defences} Ke7 {now the king  has to move and black can no longer castle} 6. Qe2 {pinning that knight!} d5 {i thought he had saved the knight but...} 7. f3 {it was still pinned, so i could play f3} Kxf7 {poor king} 8. fxe4 {more agressive play and a top heavy swap off!} Qh4+ {ooh?} 9. g3 {obviously} Qxe4 {why would black want a queen swap when it is losing!!????????} 10. Qxe4 {I gratefully accepted } dxe4 {what else could you expect?} 11. Nc3 {Now i play out (developing my pieces)} Nc6 {black also wants to develop} 12. Nxe4 {but that was a bit of a blunder!} Be7 {is black trying to do an artificial castling} 13. Bc4+ {i'm not allowing that!} Kg6 {king in the open} 14. h4 {more attack!} h5 {blocked off my advancing pawns!:(} 15. Bd3 {Going for a hidden check! - probably not going to work} Kf7 {king went back to where it was earlier forced out of} 16. Nf3 {still developing} Bg4 {black wants to gain more points now} 17. Nfg5+ {but i prefer swap offs to keep my lead!} Ke8 {He didn't take} 18. Bf4 {still; i can bring more pieces into the jumble of knights and bishops!} Nd4 {What is black trying?} 19. c3 {back you go!} Nf3+ {maybe not} 20. Nxf3 {but i prefer swap offs as mentioned} Bxf3 21. O-O {ah! i took the oppurtunity to make my rook more useful} Bg4 {bishop retreats} 22. Bg5 {i keep offering exchanges} Rd8 {black is determine to be obstinate!!} 23. Bb5+ {i decide to try something out!} Bd7 {i think i now got a forced mate} 24. Nd6+ {here it goes} Bxd6 {only option (remember i could also take the rook now with that knight sacrifice!} 25. Rae1+ {but no: i have other things in mind!} Be7 {only option} 26. Rxe7# {Yay- the anticipated mate- god i was so happy when i had seen that knight sacrifice for the inevitable CHECKMATE!:)}
