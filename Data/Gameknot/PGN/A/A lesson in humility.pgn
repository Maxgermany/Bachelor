[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. c3 {Not what I was expecting from my opponent, but I was secretly glad. I knew that my opponent had played a delayed alapin ( 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c3 )and the grand prix attack ( 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 )  back in 2013 and thus had prepared a lot for those openings. Some lines I had looked at went all the way up to 11 moves or so. A direct alapin isn't what I prepared for, but I do have a friend who plays the alapin and thus I knew some theory of it. At this point I had no idea what was in store for me.} Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 cxd4 5. cxd4 Nc6 6. Nc3 {This is as far as I know how the theory goes. Here my friend would usually just play Bc4 which I'd meet with Nb6 after which he retreats his bishop to b3. Bc4 is not the main line, but it's interesting in its own rights although I think that black equalises a tad too easily in that variation. Nc3 isn't the main line for as far as I know as I believe Nf3 is more often played in which both sides have their chances. Here I was a little clueless as to how to handle the situation.} Nb6 {I decide to play Nb6 rather then trade with Nxc3, which is probably a mistake. I was a little frightened of the pawn chain that follows since the plan of 6. Nxc3 7. bxc3 d6, immediately targeting that very pawn chain doesn't really work because of Maybe 8. exd6 Qxd6 9. Qxd6 exd6 that follows. d6 isn't a requirement, but it's one of the moves I'm used to when it comes to breaking the alapin pawnchain. I'm wasn't sure how to resolve that position and thus opted for Nb6. This is the last time these knights will get action in this game.} 7. f4 {Too aggressive in my opinion, but I didn't manage to punish him for it so I'm not sure if I can even criticize this move. It's clear that White is coming for Black's head.} d5 {I looked at all kinds of moves here, but opted for d5. e6 is great and all, but my dark squared bishop will be rather weak due to his pawns being on the dark squares and if I ever want to play f6 then I might want to keep the e-pawn there. d6 was also an option with the intention of taking his pawn on e5, but it feels rather pointless after he recaptures fxe5. The logic behind d5 is essentially to develop my light squared bishop, play e6 and close the position. Not the most ambitious plan, but I said beforehand that I would be satisfied with a draw today against a much stronger opponent. Maybe that attitude is exactly what cost me the game. In chess it's often far better to be overconfident as your play gets more ambitious. Today I learned that you should never go into a game with the thought that a draw is fine.} 8. Nf3 Bg4 {Bg4 felt stronger then Bf5. if Bf5 was played then I had some concerns regarding Bd3 which could follow. Looking back to it I should have been content with trading off our strong pieces.} 9. Be3 {Defending the d4 square so that he can recapture with his queen were Bxf3 to be played. This bishop looks bad, but f5 is bound to be played sooner or later and it'll get new opportunities there.} e6 {Closing it off. So far my logic has been pretty decent I'd say. Sadly logic doesn't necessarily win you a game. I think maybe the move f6 could have been interesting here or Rc8.} 10. h3 {He doesn't like my bishop so h3 is logical. I start thinking about 10. h3 Bh5 11. g4 Bg6 and realised I didn't like that position at all. White has so much space and it seems inevitable that he'll come crashing through in that position. Afterwards he told me he would never have played g4 since it seriously weakens his king safety, but I'm pretty convinced that he could get away with it.} Bxf3 11. Qxf3 a6 {I noticed that his light squared bishop still isn't developed and would rather not have it pester my knight. This move doesn't exactly do much aside from keeping the knight and bishop away from b5.} 12. a3 {My opponent decided that my plan of a6 isn't completely horrible and with this move tries to keep my dark squared bishop out of the game.} Be7 {Probably a grave mistake looking back on it. It doesn't seem like a mistake at first, but I think it's clear that all the action will happen on the kingside. Better would probably have been Ne7 preparing for the knight to either get to g6 of f5 and then after that play Be7. The problem with Be7 is that my knights now have no way of helping in the onslaught that is about to happen. White will play things like Bd3, castle kingside, f5 and there's just too much pieces of him attacking that side of the board to hold. The logic behind Be7 was simple.  My bishop has to go to e7 or it will never develop. The logic is sound, but there were bigger priorities in the position. Even on just move 12 a mistake like this can easily be made, it's why I always try and play incredibly slow as to not overlook the dangers in a position and alter my play accordingly. Sadly I missed it entirely this time around.} 13. Bd3 g6 {At this point I had noticed the danger. That being said g6 seriously weakens the positions. Yes it stops f5, but f5 wasn't a big threat at this point yet. Better would probably have been f6, trying to create room for black or f5 after which g6 follows and the position is not too easy to break for White.} 14. O-O {With his 2 pieces on the f-file it's about time to put on some serious pressure.} f6 {Now I finalise my idea. If he takes then my position has hope again. If I have to take then I can maybe try to castle afterwards and my rook on the f-file could create some issues for white. I was also looking at f5, but underestimated the strength of that move.} 15. f5 {Explosive! White supposedly offers a pawn, but it breaks open the position which can quickly turn vicious. I start to calculate.} exf5 {I first take the offered material since I figured that I'd be fine with him taking on f6. I however hadn't seen his next move.} 16. Bxf5 {!! I hadn't seen it coming, but it's bad. Real bad. Black can obviously win the bishop here but against what price... gxe5 Qxg5. With future threats of Qh5+, Bh8, e6, etc. I couldn't find a way out for Black if I took the bishop. If I play some random move then Bxg6+ follows after which he'll take the pawn on f6 after hxg6 and I might as well resign at that point. fxe5 isn't exactly good either since it has the same idea of Bxg6+} Rg8 {! confusing my opponent. The idea was to stop Bxg6 at all costs. if he plays exf6 then I recapture, material is even and I'll find a way out somehow. I hadn't foreseen his next move though, which is an obvious one.} 17. Be6 {White wins at least 1 pawn here.} Rf8 {Now that Bg6+ isn't a thing anymore I thought I could maybe get rid of the f-pawn and open some kind of counterplay via the f-file.} 18. Nxd5 {His knight is less important then his bishop so it's a good choice to trade it first. I probably could have traded  everything off here and go into an endgame with a pawn down, but the position would still be rather hopeless.} fxe5 {Trying the counterplay I sought after. I knew Bf7+ would follow, however I thought I had a way out of it. Apparantly I did not.} 19. Bf7+ Kd7 20. Nxb6+ {Mistake! Glad to know my opponent isn't unfailable either. He actually had a forced mate in 2 here after 20.Qg4+ Kc6 21.Qe6+ it's over and out. He had a hard time believing that he had actually missed a simple mate like this when I showed it to him in the analysisroom afterwards.} Qxb6 {The position looks even in material, but White's position is far better. The play from here is all very logical, but there's little Black can do here.} 21. dxe5 {Threatening the queen. I was looking at Nxe5 but that fails to Qd5+ or similar moves.} Qxb2 {The material is still even, but position proves far more important.} 22. Rab1 Qxe5 {The e5 pawn was more dangerous then the pawn on a3 so I choose to capture that one.} 23. Rxb7+ {Black has 2 choices here, both fall to forced checkmate. Kc8 gets met by Qxc6+ which is a checkmate in 1 after that. Kd8 is a little more tenacious but is also all forced.} Kd8 24. Bb6+ {And I resign here as after 24. Kc8 25. Qxc6+ Qc7 26. Qxc7+ it's checkmate. The game was badly played by myself ( I can do much better ), but valuable. I'm not the least bit upset about this loss. If I had won then my next opponent would probably have been a 2000 elo player regardless which probably would have meant my first loss anyway. My next opponent is someone of 1778 elo with over 1800 official matches played. That being said he's already a little older ( 78 years old if I'm not mistaking ) and from as far as I've been able to tell, looking at his past games, he always replies with the Chigorin indian defense. He either always transposes into it or plays a sideline of it and his 8 moves are more or less the same every single time. ( granted that's based of his games played in 2013, but still. After so many games I expect him to have a stable opening repertoire by now. ) I'll be ready for his opening and this time with the White pieces I'll be hunting for blood. Hopefully it'll be an enjoyable game.}
