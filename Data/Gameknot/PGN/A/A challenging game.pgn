1. d4 b6 2. Bf4 {I sometimes play the London System, which sometimes leads to uninteresting positions, but the lines are very simple.} d6 3. e3 Bb7 4. Nf3 g6 {Black is going to fianchetto both bishops.  I want to keep the board closed.} 5. Nbd2 Bg7 6. Be2 e6 {An immediate e5 from black would have opened some lines for black's bishops.} 7. c4 Ne7 8. O-O Nd7 9. Qc2 O-O 10. Rac1 h6 11. h3 e5 {Black has finally prepared e5.} 12. dxe5 dxe5 13. Bg3 Nf5 14. Bh2 Re8 15. Ne4 {A logical blockading move.} Qe7 16. Rfd1 Nc5 {I thought about this position for a while.  After the knights come off, I would be able to play e4.  } 17. Nxc5 Qxc5 18. e4 Nd4 19. Nxd4 exd4 {Black is probably better now, with a dangerous passed pawn.} 20. Bd3 {Seemingly utilitarian use of the bishop, but in the game it was a strong piece.} Qe7 21. f3 c5 {The position seems closed, with little prospect of black's d-pawn advancing.  White has limited the scope of the black bishops, and has a strong bishop on h2.} 22. Qf2 {Ideas of coming to the kingside and pressuring e6.} Qg5 {A good defense.  My next move will introduce some dynamism into the position.} 23. h4 Qe7 24. Bf4 Kh7 25. g4 {Both of white's bishops are pointing at the black king, which has come forward to support the weak h6 pawn.  White is threatening to open lines around the black king.  His own king is exposed, but he is able to keep the center closed, and minimize the scope of black's bishops.} Be5 26. Bxe5 Qxe5 27. h5 {Maybe not the best.  Maybe kf1 and ke2 was better.} gxh5 28. gxh5 Reg8+ 29. Kf1 Qxh5 30. Ke2 Rae8 31. Rdh1 Qe5 32. Qh4 Rg6 33. Rcg1 Reg8 34. f4 Qg7 {When should white play e5?} 35. Rxg6 fxg6 36. Rg1 Bc8 37. e5 Qf7 38. Rh1 Qg7 39. Rg1 Qf7 40. Rh1 Qf8 {Black declined a draw offer.  It is looking like black will defend this.} 41. Rg1 Bf5 {A crushing move.  The continuation I played, while under time pressure, frees black d-pawn and loses the game for white.} 42. Bxf5 Qxf5 43. Qe7+ Rg7 44. Qh4 Qc2+ 45. Kf3 Qd3+ 46. Kf2 Qe3+ 47. Kf1 d3 48. Rxg6 Rxg6 49.
