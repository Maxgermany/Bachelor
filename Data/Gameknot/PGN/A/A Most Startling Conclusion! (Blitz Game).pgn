1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. c4 e6 {Al is a long-time chess buddy of mine (long time - read: decades), and our games can become pretty entertaining because we're so familiar with each other's styles (which are very different) that it's almost become necessary for us to play a little "I'll ignore you if you ignore me" in the opening to end up with a game that doesn't peter out in a draw. What we've achieved here is a rare sidelight in the Queens Gambit Declined.} 5. e3 Bd6 6. Be5 Nbd7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Be2 a6 9. O-O Re8 10. h3 Bf8 11. c5 {So far this is turning into exactly the sort of game Al likes best - closed, featuring incremental positional maneuvering with a slow, deliberate build-up to the final attack. Fischer remarked about this style (speaking specifically of the late German GM Wolfgang Unzicker, as I recall, although he could have as easily mentioned Tigran Petrosian and, later, Anatoly Karpov) that if this patient constricting style doesn't produce a win then it almost always has the not necessarily unhappy consequence of producing a draw.} Ne4 12. Bh2 g5 {Black begins to lose patience with all the stodgy maneuvering, expressed by opening this self-inflicted but not completely unjustifiable wound in front of his King. Oddly, I played this more as a defensive resource (albeit aggressive defense), to give g6 to my QB and, obviously, preparing g7 for my KB.} 13. Ne5 Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Bg6 15. Nxe4 Bxe4 16. b4 {White calmly continues to improve his spatial advantage.} Bg7 17. Bxg7 Kxg7 18. f4 Qe7 {Opening communication between the Rooks and preparing a likely exit for the Black King to the center or Queenside.} 19. Bh5 h6 20. fxg5 Qxg5 {Black replies to White's threat of check with a mate threat.} 21. Rxf7+ Kh8 22. Rf2 Reg8 {Now the game is beginning to look more like the sort I enjoy playing - open, with attacking lines and tactical nuances around every corner. Here I passed on taking the e-pawn in order to gain greater pressure against White's King. After 23. ...Qe3  24. Qd2 lets the steam out.} 23. Qe2 Raf8 24. Bf3 Rxf3 25. Rxf3 Bxf3 26. Qxf3 Rg7 27. Rf1 {White is winning, but as long as the e-pawn hangs, especially with a check, the situation isn't entirely clear nor the game in the bag.} Kh7 28. Rf2 Qg6 29. Qf6 Qb1+ 30. Kh2 Qxb4 31. Qxe6 Qe1 32. Qf5+ Kh8 33. Qf4 Kh7 34. a4 c6 35. Rf1 Qd2 36. Qf5+ Rg6 37. Qf2 Qd3 38. Qf4 Qd2 39. Rf2 Qe1 40. Qc7+ Rg7 41. Rf7 Rxf7 42. Qxf7+ Kh8 43. Qf4 Kh7 44. Qe5 Qf2 45. e4 dxe4 46. Qxe4+ Kh8 47. Qe5+ Kh7 48. Qd6 Qf7 49. a5 Qg7 50. d5 cxd5 51. Qxd5 Qc7+ 52. Kh1 Kg7 53. Kg1 Qe7 {Black is obviously playing not to lose at this point, with the vulnerability of White's King giving him reason to hope for a draw.} 54. Qd4+ Kg8 55. Kf2 Qf7+ 56. Kg3 Qb3+ 57. Kh4 Qf7 58. Qd6 Kg7 59. g4 Kh7 60. Qd3+ Kg8 61. Qf5 Qe8 {A decisive mistake! 61. ...Qg7 may have been marginally better. Certainly the Black Queen must stay on squares that either check or guard the pawn at h6.} 62. Qd5+ Kh7 63. Qxb7+ Kh8 64. Qd5 {Not the horrible 64. Qa6?? when Black gets a draw by perpetual check beginning with 64. ...Qe7.} Qg6 65. Qf5 Qc6 66. Kh5 {And suddenly the faintest glimmer of hope flares anew ...all I need is one move, one move ....} Qe8+ 67. Qg6 Qe5+ 68. Kxh6 {??? Sometimes I think there really might be a god ...at least a god of chess, who watches over fish and fools like me.} Qg5+ {!!! Absolutely no credit for any other move!! White's only legal move is to take the Black Queen - and it doesn't matter whether he captures with Queen or King, creating a stalemate. And so Black snatches the proverbial kiss from his sister from the jaws of sure defeat. ...Pretty cute.}
