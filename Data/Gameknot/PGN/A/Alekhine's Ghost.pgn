[Opening "English, Nimzovich, Flohr variation (A20)"]

1. c4 e5 2. Nf3 {The flexible Nimzovich Variation, which can give rise to both standard variations or, for the more adventurous, highly independent play.} e4 {Black's most ambitious continuation.} 3. Nd4 Nf6 {Not quite in the spirit of 2. ...e4. More positionally challenging is 3. ...d5 (or even 3. ...c6, with ...d5 to follow), while an immediate 3. ...c5 sharpens the blade for a tactical fight.} 4. Nc3 c5 5. Nc2 {Playing the Knight to b3 is also possible; but after many, many moons of playing the Nimzovich variation, I've come to appreciate having the steed that extra step closer to the inevitable storm brewing in the center.} Nc6 6. g3 d6 7. Bg2 Bf5 8. d4 exd3 e.p. 9. exd3 Be7 10. O-O O-O 11. Re1 h6 12. Ne3 Be6 13. Ned5 Nd4 {Black wants a dominating Knight in the center too!} 14. Be3 Nxd5 15. Bxd5 Bxd5 16. Nxd5 Bf6 17. Qg4 {A provocative sortie!} Nc2 18. Bxh6 {Alexander Alekhine had a well-deserved reputation for conjuring up stunning combinations from seemingly innocuous positions, a devastating gift which Bobby Fischer also possessed. And while I would never seriously compare myself to either of those great world champions, the following combination unfolds as if their spirits were guiding my hand.} Nxa1 {And so Black wins an important Exchange ...right? Mmm ...maybe not.} 19. Bxg7 {Like lightning from a clear sky! Black has little choice except to play ...} Bxg7 20. Ne7+ {The next hammer-shot!} Kh7 {Objectively best is 20. ...Qe7!, with probably no worse than a draw. But who wants to float their Queen when at this point it just looks like White's giving away pieces?} 21. Qh5+ Bh6 22. Re6 {An absolute thunderbolt! This is the resource White had to see as he played 18. Bh6.  In the position the immediate threat is 23. Qh6 mate. After 22. ...f6 (or 22. ...fe6), White still mates with 23. Qg6 Kh8  24. Qh6. And finally after 22. ...Qe7 comes the prosaic 23. Qh6 Kg8  24. Re7, following which White's material advantage should carry the endgame with correct play.  And so, Black resigns.}
