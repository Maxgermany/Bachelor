1. e4 {King's pawn opening.  Nothing unusual here.} e5 {King's pawn game.} 2. d3 {Here is a move that's somewhat unusual for me.  I usually like to play 2.Nc3 to get my knight out there, but it didn't wind up making much of a difference in this game.} Nc6 {Possibly the most common move I've seen from black in the King's pawn game.} 3. Nf3 {My standard third move.  Good for development, attacks the center, forces black to keep protecting his pawn.  Sometimes I set up for 4.d4 and trade pawn and knights, but that can wait.} d6 {Shoring up the protection on his pawn.  Also opens up the diagonal for his light bishop.  Pretty common move.} 4. Bg5 {This is a move with very little upside.  I've done it a few times to try to catch someone off guard and take their queen, but no one has ever fallen for it.  The most common defense is 4...f6, which usually sends my bishop scampering back to e3 and gives black the tempo advantage.  The only thing my move does is discourage a king side castle, but really nothing else.} Be7 {He protects his queen with his bishop.  I think that he was trying to force my bishop back while developing his, but I think that this move just encourages a trade that doesn't have any real benefit for black.  4...f6 was the better move.} 5. Bxe7 {I take the trade.  Maybe not the best move in this situation, but I decided to play it aggressive.} Ngxe7 {He finishes the trade with his knight.  This is probably his best move in this situation, and gives him an advantage in tempo.  I really haven't done much so far.} 6. d4 {Now I set up for the pawn and knight trade.  the major benefit is that if he accepts, I can take control of the a1-g8 diagonal with my queen, but I also leave my queen out in the center unprotected.  Bit of a double-edged sword.} exd4 {He accepts, and starts a bloodbath for the next few moves.} 7. Nxd4 {Continuing the trade.} Nxd4 {He keeps it going.  This is the most common move, but I have seen black play 7...Ne5, or just leave his knights as is and move a knight or light bishop.} 8. Qxd4 {I finish the trade.  Phew.  That will be the last capture for a while now.} O-O {I'm not sure if I like the castle in this situation.  My queen is threatening g7, which could spell doom for black if he makes some very wrong moves.  I would've tried to drive the queen back first, but honestly, this seems like a harmless move.} 9. Nc3 {Now I start to actually develop my pieces, starting with my knight.} c6 {He prevents what I would've liked to do next (10.Nd5) and opens up a diagonal for his queen.} 10. Bd3 {Now I start my king side attack. Also opens up the king side castle in case I want to get my rook involved.} c5 {I'm not sure why he took two moves to do this.  9...c5 would've forced the same dilemma for me and would've likely either knocked my queen further back or blocked my bishop.  Instead he sets me up for some nice attacking position.} 11. Qe3 {I put my queen in the only place to save it from further harassment.} a6 {He's setting up a pawn charge, but I would've developed my bishop in this situation.} 12. O-O-O {I'm a fan of both the queen side castle and castling later in the game.  Waiting allows me to see how the board is developing, and the queen side castle often gets the rooks involved faster.} b5 {Here come the pawns.} 13. e5 {I try to halt his pawn onslaught.  } Bb7 {Now he takes control of the a8-h1 diagonal, threatening my unprotected g2 pawn.} 14. Rhg1 {I protect my pawn and keep his bishop off my 2nd rank.} b4 {He continues to march his pawns, and threatens my knight.} 15. Ne4 {I save my knight and keep it developed.  All my pieces are very concentrated in the center, but I think that I have a definite advantage in my position right now.} d5 {I don't like this move.  While he keeps marching his pawns, it gives me a prime opportunity to attack with my knight.} 16. Nf6+ {Naturally, I attack. I liked this move because it wrecked his defenses while opening up my light bishop.} gxf6 {He takes my bishop, which was the best play in this scenario.  If he had played 16...Kh8, mate would have come fairly quickly.} 17. exf6 {Now his king is trapped, and he can't take my pawn for at least two moves.} Ng6 {Now he saves his knight, attacks my pawn, and protects his king.  Definitely the best move in this situation.} 18. Qg5 {Now I launch my final assault.  I protect my pawn, keeping the king trapped, and put my queen into a very forward position.  Now it was only a matter of time until mate.} c4 {Here he threatens my bishop, which is really all that he could do in this situation.  Now he's seriously getting hurt by his pawns, which are blocking most of his other pieces.} 19. Bxg6 {Now he's pretty screwed.} Kh8 {Here he made the wrong move.  Had he played 19...Qxf6 (20. Qxf6 hxg6), I would've had a much tougher time getting to the mate.} 20. Qh6 {Now I've got mate in 1, no matter what he plays.} fxg6 {He strikes one final time, but it's not quite enough.} 21. Qg7# {And mate.  I hope this was helpful to anyone reading it, and please, give me some feedback!}
