[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Katalimov variation"]

1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian} 2. Nf3 b6 {Katilimov Variation, with plans to fianchetto the light bishop.} 3. d4 e6 4. Nc3 Bb7 5. d5 {this breaks open the position and positions one of my pieces on the nice d5 square.  } exd5 {This opens the e file, which becomes important later.} 6. exd5 Bd6 7. Bg5 {Goading black into pushing the f pawn and weakening the kingside} f6 8. Be3 Ne7 9. Nb5 Nc8 10. Bd3 {Notice how white is very developed while black has most of its forces crammed into the queenside while the king is not very protected} a6 {removing the powerful knight} 11. Nxd6+ Nxd6 12. O-O O-O {This was the wrong side to castle on since most of my pieces are already pointed that way and black's pieces are stuck on the queenside.  } 13. c4 {solidifying d5 and severly binding black's queenside pieces.  } Qc7 {This was a blunder to remove the queen from the already defenceless kingside. } 14. Qc2 {attacking h6} f5 15. Nh4 {attacking the pawn again} g6 16. Bh6 Rf7 {The king is now also immobile and the only piece to defend it was the rook.  But this temporarily prevents a possible mate on g7} 17. Rfe1 {seizing the open lane and eyeing e8} a5 {This was probably a blunder since the king is under heavy attack, yet black is not responding to the threat.  Better might have been Qd8.} 18. Nxf5 {Sacking is so fun!} gxf5 19. Bxf5 Rxf5 {This loses immediately.  Nxf5 is met with Re8 forced mate.  The only moderate continuation was Na6, opening up the A rook to defend the back rank.  } 20. Qc3 Rf7 {Rg5 might have lasted longer, but then Qf6 still leads to mate. } 21. Qg3+ Kh8 22. Qe5+ {My opponent resigned here, but after Kg8, a queen sack on e8 leads to 23. Qe8   Nxe8 24. Rxd8  Rf8 25. Rxf8# Consider the final position again.  Almost all of the black pieces were crammed into the 4*4 corner on the queen side with no immediate plans to return to the king's side.  The only defender remained was the rook.  In this game, black had castled to the wrong side and ended up with his king defenceless as his other pieces were tied to the queenside while white's attacking pieces demolished black defence.  Thanks for the nice game fenril!}
