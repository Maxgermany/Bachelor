1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. d4 {The good one. This guy will be interesting to fight. } Qa5 6. f4 {The second strongest one (the first, in my opinion, is to press on e5 directly). } Nf6 {Not Bf5, because I will have to destroy my position to defend it against g4-f5.} 7. Nf3 Bg4 {Decided to exchange it with no regrets. Now, I could have moved it on f4, because I would have had time to shield it in a7, but I went for this one instead. } 8. O-O e6 {e6 would be my weak point, but I have to move it. g6 leaves the centre in white's hands...} 9. Bd2 {The standard move here is Qc7, and it is better than the one I played. Just trying new things. This one went to be a bad one. } Qh5 10. h3 {The queen on h5 deprives black from h5 for the pawn, that is often the key of the bishop's sac. But not with the white pawn in f4! Good for white. Now, I must take the knight. I was looking for sacs, but I couldn't see any! Sigh!} Bxf3 11. Bxf3 Qh4 {At least this can seem I have a purpose for exposing my queen so much...} 12. Be1 Qh6 {Wonderful square, isn't it? ;-/} 13. Bd2 {...and I have nothing able to block f5. Oy, my, this is almost a refutation of "My Scandivian". } Qg6 {What else? } 14. Qe2 {Probably not the strongest move for white, thank's God!} Bd6 {The worst part is that I can't do anything, just going on with developement and pray...} 15. Ne4 { I don't want to lose my dsb. I can retire it on c7, but then Nc5, threatening b7... and the knight has a lot of squares. } Nxe4 16. Bxe4 {I was almost so desperate about the ridicolus role my queen was doing in this game, that I was tempted very seriously to go f5, and try to hold e6 with the help of my king and rook. But the Wise Man told me that you never have to weaken e6 in this line of the Scandinavian... terrible sacs will take place, and the whrat of white will penetrate lethally his sword into my army.} Qf6 17. c3 {Again, not the strongest one. Bc3, and I won't take on f5, probabl, due to g3.} Nd7 {I know some white pawn's advance is in schedule, but he seems in no hurry.} 18. f5 {Ah, here it comes. } O-O-O {Zen defence is a wonderful defence. } 19. fxe6 Qxe6 {Zen like. } 20. Qd3 {Releasing the pin on the queen, and aiming clearly to f5. } g6 21. Bg5 {Normal. The bishop pair is good for good reasons :-). But now I had an idea.} Nc5 {Nice, isn't it? If exN, Bxc5+, followed by RxQ. } 22. Qc2 {Now: this is nice tactics, and I don't know if I took the best decision.  If NxB, Re1, for sure, and my knight is pinned and probably lost. At the same time, I have to defend my rook from the bishop.  Rd-e8 is probably ok, exN, Bxc5+, followed by QxB.  So...} Qxe4 23. Qxe4 Nxe4 24. Bxd8 {I lose this exchange, but I have two pieces for a rook. Now let's see what the pawns say...} Rxd8 {Not with the king. The white rook will penetrate anyway.} 25. Rxf7 {Ah, yes, "collateral damage".} Rd7 26. Raf1 Ng5 {A stupid move. } 27. Rxd7 Kxd7 28. h4 {And anothe pawn is lost. My fault. } Ne4 29. Rf7+ {Here he goes. } Kc8 30. Rxh7 Bg3 31. h5 gxh5 32. Rxh5 Nd2 {The trick is to be able to avoid a fork by the rook. } 33. Rg5 Bf4 34. Rg8+ Kc7 35. g3 Bh6 36. g4 {Ok, now I hoped for him to fall for g5, when a knight fork makes him lose the pawn, overlooking...} Kb6 37. g5 Nf3+ 38. Kg2 Nxg5 {...that now, Rg6 means I lose a piece, and probably the gam. } 39. c4 {Saved!} Ne4 40. b4 Nc3 41. a3 Be3 {I have little plan, to say the truth.} 42. Rd8 Nb1 43. a4 Kc7 44. Ra8 Bxd4 45. c5 a6 {...and here, he resigned. I cannot understand why, there was a lot of game to be played...}
