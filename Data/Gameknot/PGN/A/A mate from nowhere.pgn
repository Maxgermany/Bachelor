1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Bf5 3. Nf3 Nd7 4. h3 h6 5. g4 Be4 6. Nbd2 e6 7. e3 f5 {Interesting, well known but not much played, for a reason. } 8. gxf5 exf5 9. h4 {or Rg1 at once. It is intended to prevent g5. } Ngf6 {This deprives white's queen of the h5 square. Avoiding g5 had this price. } 10. Rg1 {Freeing my knight from the pin, and eyeing g7.} Ng4 11. Bh3 {This black pieces are less dangerous then it seems, and I keep on threatening things. Now, of course, black has the edge, and after h5 clamps me very badly... but so does himself. It would be another game. } Bd6 {This black bishop is one of my best pieces, but true is that actually it is not doing much. } 12. Bxd6 cxd6 {A doubled central pawn, maybe not good for me. } 13. Bxg4 {...but now I can cash my pawn. Too bad I lose my second bishop. } fxg4 14. Rxg4 Qf6 {I want to jump with the knight with a plan, not just taking it off there. } 15. Rf4 Qg6 16. Rc1 {I mantain it was better than NxB. Qg1+ looks ugly. } O-O-O {This gives me an idea. But I saw it late, after I moved...} 17. Ke2 {I thought that after Qg1 I would have ran out of the pressure. THis kind of strange defence can work, sometimes, but I overlooked the obvious...} Rdf8 {No choice. h5, Qxh5, Rh4 doesn't look appealing. } 18. Rxf8+ Rxf8 19. c4 Bxf3+ {Ok, this was acceptable. } 20. Nxf3 Qg4 {I saw this, and my defence is...} 21. cxd5+ Kb8 22. Qh1 {Ugly, but it somehow stops the inmediate threats. Now black has to find a way to break in. } Nf6 23. Rg1 Qh5 24. Rxg7 Nxd5 {This knight, in this square, is well far from threatening mine, so...} 25. Rd7 {I started a ball, here, shocked that I wasn't mated yet. } Nf6 26. Rxd6 Ne4 {Not even this worries me... can it be possible?} 27. Re6 Qg4 28. Rxh6 {My defence holds, against all odds, and my rook is free to fly here and there. } Nd2 {A good attempt, white, but...} 29. Kxd2 Rxf3 {A mate is in sight for white, but, very, very surprisingly...} 30. Qh2+ {White wins (or gets an overwhelming advantage). } Kc8 {Only move. } 31. Rh8+ {What's the game? It will be back and forth. } Kd7 32. Rh7+ {...and here, white has drawn game, since black can't affort to move the king away from squares d7 or c8, or it will be mated. Don't believe me?} Kc6 {If Ke6, Qe5#. If K in the 8 row, other than c8, Qb8#.} 33. Qc7+ Kb5 34. Qxb7+ Kc4 35. b3# {Poor black. It was hard to foresee!}
