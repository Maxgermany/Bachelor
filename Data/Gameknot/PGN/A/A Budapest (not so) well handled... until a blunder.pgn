[Opening "Budapest defence declined (A51)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 {I'm exploring the Budapest, I must say with no luck. } 3. d5 Bb4+ 4. Nc3 {The weaker defence. It allows...} Ne4 5. Qc2 f5 6. Nf3 {Wisely avoiding Qh4.} d6 {Or o-o. If Nxe5, Qh4, g3, Qd4.} 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 {Now black has to think about developing safely, with the semiopen b column. b6 was simple and wise, but it seemed not enough to me, so...} c6 {If white exchanges, my knight can go out with tempo. On the other side, the d6 pawn becomes weak, but... maybe I can handle that. } 9. Nd2 {Qh4, g3 is not any good. But I can indirectly defend the pawn with...} cxd5 10. cxd5 Qa5 {This one. If NxN, fxN, white cannot go Qxe4 because of Qxc3+.} 11. Nxe4 fxe4 12. Bd2 {And this gives me the chance to play...} Qxd5 {So black is not cramped anymore: a good center control, even without the e4 pawn, ready to castle... if c4, Qd4, threatening the rook, Rb1 still presents problems for black to develop, but it seems playable. If Qa4+, Nc6 controls the threat.} 13. e3 {Avoiding Qd4. The e4 pawn is a goner, but it gives me tempoes to...} O-O 14. c4 Qf7 {Pressing f2. } 15. Bb4 Qf6 16. Ra2 {Defending f2. } Nc6 {At least I can get rid from the nasty dsb.} 17. Qxe4 Nxb4 18. axb4 Be6 {I calculated that the b7 pawn will open the column for my rook.} 19. Qxb7 Rab8 {With a rook on b and another on c8, I felt confortable. g7 is a weak point, but the queen controls it.} 20. Qc7 Rxb4 {If Qxd6, Rb1+ proves to be deadly. } 21. Bd3 {Wise. Now, how to go on? I could have tried Ra4, since after RxR, Qxf2+ and Bg4+. But I didn't see it. } d5 {"This can't be bad"...} 22. O-O {Rc8! was the move. Or e4.} dxc4 23. Qc5 {This forces me to...} Rfb8 24. Be4 {A big mistake by white.} c3 25. Rxa7 {Now, the simple RxB wins. But I DIDN'T SEE IT! My fault. It seems so easy, but I was so focused on the possibilities of that pawn in c3 that I overlooked it. } Bc4 {I calculated that bringing the rook out of f1, my threats on f2 would be renewed, overlooking, again...} 26. Bd5+ Bxd5 27. Qxd5+ Kf8 28. Qc5+ Kg8 29. Qxc3 {A pawn less and a cramped position is the deserved result of my blindness. } Rb4b1 30. Rc1 e4 {Playing the back rank tunnel whites' king is in. } 31. Qc2 {Out of time, I wasn't able to calculate adecuately. Qb6 is playable.} Rxc1+ 32. Qxc1 {Now Qb6 is still good. } Qe6 33. g3 {Tunnel opened, the game is without interest.} Qb6 34. Rc7 Rf8 35. Qc4+ Kh8 36. Rc8 Qf6 37. Rxf8+ Qxf8 38. Qxe4 {And now a sure loss... no worth trying. } g6 39. Qe5+ {I lost, but the opening was good. }
