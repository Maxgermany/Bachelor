1. g3 {Benko, let me be far away from typical openings, and let me often make a fianchetto. Defensive style? may be} e5 2. Bg2 d5 {It's just what I use to make in this situation a strong pawn center, I don't want to give this chance without fight } 3. d4 {3. c3, is an interesting option, because avoid the threat Bb4 , and let the Queen constitute a threat, but I prefer develop my Knight} e4 {A pass e-pawn close the door for fianchetto structure, and it becomes so annoying, an interesting challenge} 4. c4 {pressure on center is one of my preferred themes} Bb4+ 5. Bd2 {Change the Bishops is not often my choice, but avoid the possibility of a c3-c4 Pawns after the change of B-Bishop for W-Knight} Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2 c6 7. cxd5 cxd5 {The open c-file shows too early where the battle will be developed, or not?} 8. Nc3 Nc6 9. f3 {Everything could happen now} f5 10. Nh3 {The Knight may be an fickle resourse in this Pawn's structure, most of all if can be placed on f4, f2 or g5 but many things must happen first} Nf6 11. O-O O-O {More than protection, castles point to develop Rooks, a main resourse with the c-file open} 12. Rac1 Qe7 13. e3 {Originally I hope to free my Bishop, but the castle becomes too weak if a change of f-pawns on e4 occurs} Nb4 14. a3 {Black pieces have more freedom of maneuver, by now, White must repeal it patiently} Nd3 15. Rc2 Be6 16. b4 Rac8 17. Nf4 {Perhaps a good change for White, giving the circumstances, this Knight protecting c-file is a nightmare for the Rook on c2} Nxf4 18. exf4 {It's very risky considering the pass pawn and a half-open-e-file supported by the B-Queen. In the other hand, the change of Black e-pawn could give value to the Bishop on both the a2-g8 or h3-c8 diagonals and to the Black Knight if placed on e4} Rc6 19. Re1 {White seems to forget c-file thinking on not-yet-open e-file, but perhaps the following positional dialogue is interesting} Rfc8 20. Qe3 Kf7 21. h3 a6 22. Rcc1 {A Queen based structure} b5 23. Ne2 exf3 {Ups! a two flanks war} 24. Bxf3 {As said, a hand to hand fight for c-file more the opening of e-file, in addition e4 becomes a dynamic battle field, Black has the choice} Ne4 25. Bxe4 dxe4 {25. ..., fxe4 is interesting too, if then follow 26. ..., Qd7} 26. Rc5 {! Changing the environment} Rc6xc5 27. dxc5 {... in fact, Three Pawns vs Two in the Q-side is a nice compensation for White, and surprise! the new open d-file. Bishop or Knight? Who's more powerful? By chance, the exchange free me from the responsibility of an isolated d4 Pawn} Rd8 28. Nd4 Qf6 {Black is preparing to use the big field a1-d4 by making pressure on the Knight, the Bishop becomes a headache, for the freedom of move, protected by his own Pawns, the route: c4-d3, compromising the defense of the Knight} 29. Rd1 Bc4 30. Qf2 {! White Queen has many work, She must to protect the K-pawn structure from a possible Qg6, Knight will need protection after it backs down because of the Bishop, but at the same time after c6, if possible, Qa7 is a good counterattack, for this reason Kg2 or Kh2 is not good because could compromise the plan} Bd3 31. Nc2 Qb2 {? Weak move, perhaps Qc3 may be better, I think, most of all, because avoid c6} 32. c6 {holding up and waiting for a little chance} Rc8 33. Qa7+ {Let's go} Kg6 34. Qd7 {! A little strong h3-c8 diagonal for Queen, let her threat the Rook, the f5 Pawn, and the check on e6} Qxc2 {?? Too late by one tempo} 35. Qe6+ Kh5 36. Qxf5+ Kh6 {37. Qg5#}
