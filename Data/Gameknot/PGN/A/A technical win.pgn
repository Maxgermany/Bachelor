1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. d5 {Not the most usual.} Bc5 {? Bh4 presses and threats Ne4.} 4. h3 d6 5. e4 Bd4 {The idea is to "force" Ne2, or I'll win e4. } 6. Bd2 {? Without seeing the danger. } Bxc3 7. Bxc3 Nxe4 8. Qd3 Bf5 {I threat Ng3.} 9. Qb5+ {Threatening b7. I'll leave him take it.} c6 10. Qxb7 {Here, the tactic shot is Qh4, g3, Nxg3} Qb6 {This heads for a lvely game, but throws away black's advantage. } 11. Qxb6 axb6 12. dxc6 {Now Ne4 has only one scope...} Nxc3 13. bxc3 Nxc6 {No problem if...} 14. Bb5 Kd7 {...because of this. I can live with the pin, with care.} 15. Nf3 Bxc2 {Ng5 is not a worry... unless a WR is on d1.} 16. a4 h6 {Securing g5 so to be able to play f5. } 17. O-O Be4 {Threatening to exchange the B but shattering white's pawns even more. } 18. Nd2 Bd5 19. c4 Be6 {White's lsb is closed in, my lsb is safe, and I can go pushing my pawns. } 20. Rfd1 {Only thing to worry about: d6.} Kc7 21. Bxc6 Kxc6 22. Ne4 Rhd8 {It should be solid.} 23. Rdc1 f5 {Winning space and ridding out of the threat on d6.} 24. Nd2 e4 {? conceding d4. Very bad. } 25. Nb3 Bd7 {Taking measures against Nd4.} 26. Nd4+ Kc5 {Let's see this K.} 27. Nb3+ Kb4 {Despite whie's heavy pieces, my K (I bet) is safe!} 28. Nd2 Rxa4 {Maybe Bxa4 would have been better. } 29. Rcb1+ Kc3 {! White is cramped, and b6 is just not enough compensation.} 30. Rxa4 Bxa4 31. Ra1 Be8 {Shielding the B against further attacks. } 32. Nf1 Kxc4 {And I got a third pawn without losing mines! I felt proud.} 33. Ra7 {Now the delicate defence of all my brave soldiers...} g6 34. Rh7 h5 35. Ne3+ Kc5 36. Rc7+ Kb5 37. Nd5 Bc6 {Necessary to prevent Rb7 and Rxb6.} 38. Ne7 Be8 {Necessary to defend g6. White can draw by repetition, maybe.} 39. Ng8 {He went otherwise, giving me the chance to prove my win.} Rd7 {I win by exchanging R.} 40. Rc8 Bf7 41. Nf6 Ra7 {Counterattacking.} 42. Rd8 Kc6 {! The key move} 43. Rf8 b5 {Nothing can stop my pawn now. } 44. Nh7 b4 45. Ng5 Bd5 46. Rb8 Rb7 47. Rc8+ Kb5 48. Rc1 b3 49. Rb1 Kb4 50. h4 {White's only hope is f3, but e3!} Bc4 51. Nh3 Bd3 52. Rb2 Kc3 {The R is squareless.} 53. Nf4 {The last blunder, but white was lost anyway.} Kxb2 54. Nxd3+ exd3 {An unusual "technical" win for me. Thank you for reading. }
