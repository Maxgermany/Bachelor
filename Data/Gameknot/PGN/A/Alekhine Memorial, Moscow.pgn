1. c4 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 e5 4. Nc3 Ne7 5. d3 c6 6. e4 {Blocking the diagonal of the fianchettoed bishop, as Keene points out in "Flank Openings" the whole concept of erecting the structure c4-d3-e4 "is based on one of Nimzowitsch's ideas:  White holds the centre under restraint and prepares the flank advances f4 and b4"  However, unlike positions with the queen's knight developed on c6, when the choice of White's central pawn formation would be merely a matter of taste, Botvinnik is practically forced to adopt his customary set-up here, as Black was threatening to ply  ...d5 under favorable conditions.  Kotronias } d6 7. Nge2 a6 8. a4 a5 9. Be3 Be6 10. O-O Qd7 11. b3 h5 12. h4 Bh3 {Szabo has played methodically enough to restrain White's ambitons on the wings and now proceeds to exchange light-squared bishops, a decision strategically justified if one takes into account tht d3-d4 always renders the position of the bishop on e6 problematic.  His plan is not lacking in finesees and would have been almost perfect, were it not for the loss of time involved and the passive position of the knight on e7.   Kotronias} 13. d4 O-O 14. Ra2 {A fine move, highlighting Black's weaknesses along the d-file.  At the same moment it reveals a fascinating aspect of flank openings, namely the ability to cause Black distress through "indoor manoeuvring".  The psychological impact on Szabo becomes evident after a couple of moves.   Kotronias } Bxg2 15. Kxg2 d5 {An unsound attempt to break free.  The Hungarian had t live with the idea of defending a backward pawn and to this end the best continuation was 15...exd4 16Bxd4!? (16 Nxd4 Na6 17 Rd2 Rad8  looks playable for Black) 16...Na6 17 Bxg7 Kxg7  18 Qd4+ Kh7 (it is important to put the king here in order to be able to repel the queen invasions on f6 with ...Ng8) 19 Rd2 Rfd8! (19...Rad8? (19...Rad8?  20 Qb6)  with chances to defend successfully, White can improve on this line by means of 18 Rd2! Rad8 19 e5 but Black's resources are not exhausted:  19...Nf5! (not 19...d5? 20 Qa1! with an attack)  20...Nc5 and it is not easy for White to win a pawn without allowing some counterplay.   Kotronias} 16. dxe5 dxc4 17. bxc4 Bxe5 18. Qxd7 Nxd7 19. Rd2 {Black's pseudo-activity has back-fired, but considering the undeveloped state of his queenside this was a rather inevitable conclusion.  The remainder was undoubtedly sheer torture for Szabo, as he could only sit back and watch his position collapse, in order to reach a respectable number of moves.} Bxc3 20. Rxd7 Bb4 21. c5 Rfe8 22. Rfd1 f5 23. Rxb7 fxe4 24. Rd6 Kf7 25. Nf4 Reb8 26. Rbd7 Ke8 27. Ne6 {}
