1. d4 {standard} d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {hmmm... i think that Nf6 is better} 3. Bg5 h6 4. Bh4 f6 {? this is a pointless move! or at least i think that it is! better is Nf6.} 5. e3 Bg4 6. Nbd2 e5 {not bad} 7. h3 Bxf3 8. Nxf3 {now white can go, dxe5 Nxe5 and Nxe5 winning} Qd6 {best move} 9. c3 g5 {again, not bad} 10. Bg3 Qe6 11. Bb5 a6 {? now this looses a pawn as you will see, better is e4!} 12. Bd3 {? well, i was wrong!! white should have gone, Bxc6+! Qxc6 (or pawn) dxe5 winning a pawn} e4 {! wins a piece} 13. Bc2 Bd6 {?? a terrible move! best is exf3} 14. Nd2 Bxg3 15. Qh5+ Qf7 16. Qxf7+ Kxf7 17. fxg3 {i think that the game is about equal!

Nxe4 {? better is cxd5! then Bxe4+ and that was how could have won a pawn!} dxe4 29. Bxe4+ f5 30. d5 Ref6 {! threatening, fxe4} 31. Bc2 Ne5 {now black is up!!} 32. b3 c5 33. e4 Kh6 {? better is fxe4.} 34. exf5 Nxf5 {?? this just looses a piece!} 35. Bxf5 Ng6 36. Bxg6 {best} Kxg6 37. Rf4xf6+ Rxf6 38.
