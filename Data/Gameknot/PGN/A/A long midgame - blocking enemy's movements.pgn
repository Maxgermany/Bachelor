1. e4 d5 {My usual. } 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ {My usual, again. } 4. Nge2 {They don't play it anymore, normally. It is not bad, since it supports an early bishop outcome to f4, occupying the good diagonal for white's dsb. } c6 5. d3 {The normal white move is e4, then Qa5, and the games proceeds as usual. Black is uneasy, but holds. Now, the played move makes things quieter and easier for black. } Bf5 {g5 is an alternative, maybe better, just to fight against black's Bf4. } 6. h3 {This is ugly. White could have taken at once Bf4. Maybe he is letting it for later, knowing that it will always be there. } e6 {I have no choice but to go on developing. Now g5 is not possilble anymore. } 7. a3 {Another loss of tempo, even if white is not in a hurry. Since I plan to castle queenside, Bb4 is not a wise move for me, and there is no need for white to prevent it. } Bd6 {This is the right spot for the bishop. But in this moment, it is a huge mistake: Bf4 now, Qc5, b4, and I have to lose the bishop. } 8. d4 {Now it is bad: it could have been played before. } Qa5 9. Bd2 Qc7 {Black loses tempoes relocating his queen. But this is now in the right square. } 10. g4 {Foreseen, and no problem. } Bg6 11. f4 {This time white's attack is ok. } Ne7 {Not the best. I have to shield the king queenside ASAP, so Nd7 was indicated. This move doesn't prevent white to break the black center with f5. Now, if he does, black has countergame with Bg3+, NxB, QxN+, Ke7, exf56.} 12. Bg2 {This doesn't change too much the situation. By now, white's lsb bites granite. } Nd7 {Fixed: now I can castle wherever I want. But I'll delay castling the more I can, since white has ready-made pawns' storm on both sides.} 13. h4 {Here he goes. } h5 {The recommended defence (if a6, h5, Bh7, g5 provides white with attack).} 14. g5 {As spine in my chest, but it blocks white's attack. I can even think about castling behind white's pawns.  } Bf5 {I considered Nf5, but I'm not in a hurry, and maybe Bg4 - Ng6 etc. provides me with better perspective. Note white's pieces are stuck to the defence of f4, and white can't use his queen at all, nor castling queenside. } 15. Bf3 {Good. } Ng6 {Attacking again f4 and h4, preventing o-o and blocking the rook from moving from the h column. White allowed me an even game, and I don't feel inferior by any mean. } 16. Qc1 {Only one to save f4. now the problem is mine: how to go on? } Nb6 {Trying to reach Bd2, but of course...} 17. b3 Nd5 {Not other choice to progress. } 18. Nxd5 {If cxd, c4 would be good for white. And now it is very doubious to castle kingside due to Bxh5. } exd5 {I am a move ahead in occupying the e column. He cannot move the knight!} 19. Be3 {Qa5+ doesn't give me anything after c3.} Bg4 {A blunder, since I thought the h pawn would be exposed after the exchange. I know, just a blunder. But if I want to castle, I have to do someting about the bishop looking at d4. I have to prevent c4 at any cost. } 20. Bxg4 hxg4 21. h5 {Ouch!} Ne7 {The knight cannot go elsewhere...} 22. Ng3 {...and whites finally can move his knight. I start sweating. } O-O-O 23. O-O {! white feels secure after this... the midgame is becoming very interesting and long. } g6 {I have to support f5, even at the cost of...} 24. h6 {White can't play f5... still. } Nf5 25. Nxf5 gxf5 {Now this is interesting. My g4 pawn is now strongly supported, and can be a tactical resource to strangle white's king at any time. } 26. c4 {Of course. I have to survive this, now. } Kb8 {Time was running out, so I had to play the more logical one, without thinking too much about consecuences. I saw that Be7 was good: Bxg5, and if fxB, Qg3+ was lethal for white. But I had to be really sure before playing this, and I had no time. If the queens are exchanged, the Bxg5 plan falls, and my bishop stays in a bad square.  } 27. cxd5 cxd5 {QxQ is not bad for me. My bishop would be better on c7, in fact. } 28. Qd2 {Now the Be7-Bxg4 plan is whorthless. I have to think about Rc1 by white... Qe7 was a logical plan, but after Re1, I don't make any progress. Bxa3 is just a poisoned pawn, that opens white's lines to my king. } Qb6 29. b4 {Affordable. The pawns are threatening, but I have time before they become a real danger. } Rde8 {Rc8, and exchanges, are not good for me. White has a bad bishop, and I have to exploit it. With an eye on the threatening h white's pawn. } 30. Rab1 {Maybe it was better to use the other rook for this square. } Re4 {Just to make some pressure, but nothing serious. } 31. a4 {Here they come. } Rhe8 {I am not really threatening the bishop if white plays h7... but I am not compelled to take it. } 32. Rfe1 {White loses a tempo defending the bishop. } Qd8 {This prevents the h7 threat, and again white has to defend the bishop to free his queen. } 33. Rb3 {...which he does. } Qe7 {Renewing the threats, if white wants to move any of his pieces from defence of the dsb. } 34. Qh2 {Preparing h's advance. Of course I cannot take the bishop. } Bxb4 {But I can take this. It opens the files against my king, so it is risky. } 35. Re2 a5 {...and with this one, the threats are covered for the moment. White cannot move the bishop, again... this is very interesting. } 36. h7 Rh8 37. Qh6 {oh oh, I didn't see it. But be calm. } Qf8 {Since white's dsb is bad, I can afford a queen's exchange and the fight for the h8 spot. } 38. Qf6 {If I have to choose, I prefer f7 than f4 to be taken. You'll see why. } Qc8 {I free him the way for the lethal g6, but I have some threat on c1, too...} 39. Qxf7 Rxe3 {The end of the midgame, the crisis... was it good?} 40. Rbxe3 Qc1+ {No, it wasnt. If white goes Kg2, I just lost a tempo, and I will lose (or near to) after g6. But it white's turn to blunder. } 41. Re2e1 Bxe1 {Re8+, RxR, QxR+, Ka7, h8=Q but I win with Bh4+, and subsequent mate (or I guessed so!)} 42. Qg8+ {No point in losing the rook now or later... apparently. But I had the feeling the tempo used by white in taking the rook would be decisive. And it was. } Ka7 {Now, the good thing is if Qxd5, I can win with the checks helped with Rxh7!, even if I am under a perpetual threat...} 43. Qxh8 {A losing move, but what else?} Qxe3+ {White cannot give check inmediately, so I'm pretty sure I'll win. Even if mate cannot be given right now, I have the g3 threat waiting... } 44. Kh1 Qf3+ {he resigned here. After Kg1, Qf2+, Kh1, g3, white can't stop the mate in h2. } 45. Kg1 Qf2+ 46. Kh1 {}
