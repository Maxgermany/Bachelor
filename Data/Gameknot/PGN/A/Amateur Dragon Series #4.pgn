1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. Qd2 O-O 8. f3 Re8 {Yet another game featuring the bizarre ..Re8 idea. In some corner of the world, is someone recommending this? If chess is a dance, this move is like your date pulling you aside to whisper, "I'm not wearing any panties." } 9. O-O-O Nc6 10. g4 Nxd4 {A standard Dragon idea, clearing the c-file and readying ..Be6. Of course, Black has other options too. } 11. Bxd4 Be6 12. h4 {The 2-pawn attack (rather than h4-h5, sac, sac, mate, in Fischer style) is slower and stronger (in general - if it is too slow, it's simply lost). It is a general principle in chess that pawn attacks are slow and strong (often irresistible if there are enough pawns), but their lack of speed is the point. Black must create activity on the queenside or White will break through. } Qa5 13. a3 {Black threatened a2, and this is the best way to meet it. Kb1 is actually weaker in this specific position, as the b2 pawn is often pinned to the king and Black's ..b5 plan will be more dangerous then. Alternative variation: 13. Kb1 } Rac8 {...Rab8 may have been more accurate, as the c-file is well defended at the moment and the b-pawn must move in any event. } 14. h5 gxh5 {Not the best defense, but the position is hopeless. Black's best idea is ..a6 followed by .. b5, counterattacking in thematic fashion. At this point, though, Black's attack is likely to be too slow. } 15. gxh5 Nxh5 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. Bb5 {Winning on the spot. White's move blocks the queen from the 5th rank, and specifically the g5 square. White has a devastating advantage. } Rxc3 {A strong practical reply. White has a won game, but if he falls in for Black's threats here, Black may emerge with a savable game. The reader can probably see, however, that White's mating attack simply "gets there first." } 18. Qg5+ Kf8 19. Qxh5 Rxc2+ 20. Kxc2 Rc8+ 21. Kb1 {}
