1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {A general Sicilian defense} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {The Kalashnikov variation} 5. Nb5 d6 6. Nb1c3 a6 7. Na3 Nf6 8. Bg5 {It is thematic for White to play b5 with the threat of b4 and so it is necessary to protect the e4 pawn with this Bishop move} Be7 9. Bxf6 {8. ... Be7 broke the pin and so Black gives up the bishop for the knight.  A favourable exchange for Black in this position as the Black knight was excerting pressure on the e4 square.  Furthermore, Black's bishop on f6 is looking into its own pawn chain} Bxf6 10. Be2 b5 11. Nd5 {A good outpost square for the knight} Nd4 12. O-O Nxe2+ {I'm not sure how this exchange helps Blacks position.  The bishop was doing very little.} 13. Qxe2 O-O 14. c3 {Preparing to re-position the a3 knight to a better square} Bg5 15. Rad1 {Developing a piece and strengthening the d5 square} f5 16. exf5 {The most principled move} Bxf5 17. Nc2 Qa5 {Seemingly going after the a3 pawn - surely there is something better for Black} 18. a3 Be6 19. Nce3 Bxe3 20. Qxe3 Bxd5 21. Rxd5 {Black exchanges off the remaining minor pieces.  Black's main weakness is the backward d6 pawn.  He also has 3 pawn islands to White's two but with all major pieces still on the board a draw is likely} Rad8 22. Rfd1 Rf6 23. h3 {Using a lull in the game to create a luft for the King} Qa4 24. Qb6 {Although at first glance it looks like White will win the d6 pawn, the drawback of this move is that it allows Black to generate his own counter-play} Rdf8 25. Rd1d2 {? - A better move would have been 25. Rxd6} Qe4 26. Rd2d1 Rf6xf2 27. Qxf2 Rxf2 28. Kxf2 {And so the game enters to new phase with a material inbalance of two Rook's v.'s a Queen.  White is also a pawn down} Qc2+ 29. Kg1 Qxb2 30. Rd5xd6 Qxa3 {White is now two pawns down.  This position may be theoretically lost for White although as the game played out a draw did look the most likely outcome.} 31. Rc6 a5 32. Rc7 {With the simple threat of 33. Rd8#} h6 33. Rdd7 {Black must generate counter-play against the White King so as to stall the advance of the Black pawns} Qc1+ 34. Kh2 Qf4+ 35. Kg1 {Black could have forced a draw by repetition here but chose to play on} Qf6 36. Rca7 {? - Better was 36. Rb7} a4 37. Rdb7 e4 {Not a particularly good move but then the position is such it's difficult to see the best plan for Black} 38. Rxb5 Qxc3 39. Rxa4 {A draw still seems the most likely outcome - the two Rook's can easily stop Black's passed pawn} e3 40. Ra8+ Kh7 41. Re8 Qe1+ 42. Kh2 e2 43. Rbe5 Qb4 44. Re5xe2 {The remainder of the game is Black playing for on only to blunder and lose his Queen for a Rook} h5 45. Re8e7 h4 46. Re7e4 Qd6+ 47. Kh1 Qf6 48. Re4e6 Qf1+ 49. Kh2 g5 50. Re2e1 Qf4+ 51. Kh1 g4 52. hxg4 Qxg4 53. Re6e4 Qg3 54. Re1e3 Qg5 55. Re4e5 Qg4 56. Re5e4 Qg5 57. Re4e7+ Kg6 {?? } 58. Re3e6+ Kf5 {Or 58. ... Kh5 with the same end} 59. Re6e5+ Kf6 60. Rxg5 Kxg5 {Black resigns}
