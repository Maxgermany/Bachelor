1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7 {This is the Cozio Defense.} 4. c3 d6 {The usual move here is 4. ...d5. The text is solid enough, but passive.} 5. d4 a6 6. Ba4 {I thought for almost a minute over this obvious move, calculating variations beginning with 6. d5 before finally rejecting them all.} exd4 7. cxd4 b5 8. Bb3 g6 9. Ng5 {Pretty blunt, but why not? Although it occurs to me as I write this that 9. Bf7 was a shot: 9. Bf7 Kf7  10. Qf3+ and ...Bf5 regains the piece while 10. ...Ke8  11. Qf7 Kd7  12. Nh7 with the threat of Nf6 mate. Combinations like this make a lot of C-players blanch.  ;-) ---- Whoops: it was pointed out to me that I got my analysis wrong, and the reader is correct. Disregard all of the above. Thanks.} d5 10. Qf3 Be6 11. Nxe6 fxe6 12. Be3 Bg7 13. e5 Qd7 14. O-O Nf5 15. Nc3 {? - Should drop the d-pawn.} O-O 16. Qg4 Nh6 17. Qh3 Qf7 {?? -- Instead, it's Black who drops a piece.} 18. Bxh6 Nxd4 19. Bxg7 Qxg7 20. Rad1 {There's no way to save the Bishop except the awkward 20. Bd1, so now I braced for ...Nxb3.} Qxe5 21. Rfe1 Qf6 {Taking stock: Black is two pawns up for his piece, and has an unbroken chain from the a- to e-files, against which White has only his a-, b-, and and f-pawns. Right about now I was actually a little worried I might not have enough endgame compensation with all the heavy hitters still on the board.} 22. Qe3 Nxb3 23. axb3 Rae8 24. Qd2 {Steady nerves are, of course, not all a player needs in an extremely unbalanced position like this, but they certainly help. What White really needs is open lines and penetration into Black's position, and the exchange of at least one pair of Rooks to keep Black from tripling on the f-file. How to get it?} c5 25. Re3 d4 {? -- Too tempting, I guess. In my opinion the right continuation here was 25. ...Qg5  26. Qe2 Rf6} 26. Rf3 Qe5 27. Rxf8+ Rxf8 {One pair of Rooks bites the dust. Mission accomplished.} 28. Ne2 Qf6 29. Ng3 h5 30. f3 h4 31. Nf1 {?! -- Naturally e4 is a much better square for the Knight.} e5 32. Rc1 {But White has targets, and begins to pick at them as a feint. The real goal is Queen penetration, to get behind Black's pawns.} Qd6 33. Ne3 {! -- Now the Knight's heading toward another good square, g4.} Rf4 34. Ng4 Kg7 35. h3 {The text simply closes the K-side and makes it difficult if not impossible for Black to whip up a mating attack. White knows that now every pawn move by Black will either open lines or create avenues for penetration. Patience is the magic word in this position.} g5 36. Re1 Rf5 37. Qd3 Kg6 {?? -- Overlooking ...} 38. Rxe5 {! -- Regaining material. Now if 38. ...Qf8  39. Rd5! c4  40. bc4 bc4  41. Qe5 liquidates Black's pawn advantage and leaves White in a piece-up endgame. Black resigns.}
