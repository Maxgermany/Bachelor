1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 {The Kings Indian, Sämisch ... I love to play this with both White and Black, because it has a great offer of different strategies. And as always in a Kings Indian, initiative is paramount.} O-O 6. Be3 Nc6 7. Nge2 a6 8. Qb3 {So far we have followed theory, but this move I can´t find anywhere in the books or databases. And in combination with long castling it doesn´t look sound. The Queen will come under fire, giving Black some valuable tempi, as we shall see.} Rb8 9. O-O-O Bd7 10. Kb1 b5 11. cxb5 axb5 12. Ng3 {Of course it is too dangerous to grab the pawn on b5.} b4 13. Nce2 Na5 14. Qc2 b3 15. axb3 Nxb3 16. Rd3 {The White Rook comes into action for the defence, but look a the positions of the two Kings. White´s only have one pawn for cover, while Black´s can sleep peacefully.} Na5 17. Ra3 c5 {Defending the Knight, and threatening Qb6-Qb4 with more power in the attack.} 18. h4 Qb6 19. Ra2 Be6 20. d5 {A very natural response, but this is a crucial moment. White´s Bishop on f1 is out of the game, and so is Rh1. The two Knights are more or less away from where the action is, so it wasn´t too dificult to find the sacrifice of a piece to open the lines for Black´s Bishops.} Nxd5 21. exd5 Bxd5 22. Nc3 Bb3 {A "zwischenzug" to put the White Queen on a less favorable square, since the Black Knight on a5 wins a tempo going to b3 later.} 23. Qd2 Bxa2+ 24. Kxa2 {24. Nxa2, Qxb2  25. Qxb2, Rxb2  and Black wins decisive material after either 26. Ka1 or 26. Kc1.} Nb3 25. Qe2 Bxc3 26. Qb5 {Only move. 26. bxc3 is mate after Nc1  and Qb1  followed by Qb3 mate.} Qxb5 27. Bxb5 Rxb5 28. Rc1 {?? - but 28. bxc3 is no better: 28 -, Nd4! (threatening Ra8#) 29. Bc1 (only move), Ra8  30. Ba3, Nc2 and curtains.} Nxc1+ 29. Bxc1 {Of course White should just resign, but even chess-players believe in miracles ...} Bxb2 30. Bxb2 Ra8+ 31. Kb1 {Everything wins, but I had hoped for the cute alternative: 31. Ba3, c4! - when White can´t do anything against 32. -, Rb3 and 33. -, Raxa3 mate.} Rab8 {White resigns, but I would like to thank my opponent for many great games during the time on GameKnot - and thanks to the inventor of the Kings Indian!}
