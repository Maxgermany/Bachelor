1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {3. Bb5 - this is the start of the Ruy Lopez (known as the Spanish Torture).  This move puts pressure on black's e5, although after the bishop captures the knight and black recaptures with the d pawn, the e pawn cannot be taken immediately because of a queen fork on d4.} a6 {3....... a6 - this is the standard defence to this called the Morphy Defence, puts the question to the lsb.} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {4. .......... dxc6 - the Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation.  Now here's a lesson for you, just don't do what I do later on, exchange down to a king and pawn ending with the pawn structure as it is now.  As you will see, you will lose!  You will lose!  I got suckered into playing into the K & P ending because I have never been in a K & P ending with an Expert, 500 points north of my rating with material even before and I though I would be OK because my king was more centralised than my opponent's.  My opponent quashed this illusion and gave me a thorough lesson in how to exploit this type of K & P ending!} 5. O-O f6 {5. ....... f6 - the Gligoric variation - this is considered the most solid response to 5. 0-0.  A more aggressive choice in the DB is Bg5, but f6 is more my style - f6 backs up the e pawn.  My knight will go to e7 on move 12 after castling queenside.} 6. d4 exd4 7. Nxd4 {7. Nxd4 - one pair of pawns has been exchanged and relieves pressure on e5.  I now advance my pawn to c5 to drive back the knight.} c5 8. Ne2 Qxd1 9. Rxd1 Be6 {9. ........ Be6 - the queens have been exchanged and I now start to move wood off my back rank beginning with Be6.} 10. Nbc3 Bd6 {10. ........... Bd6 - develops another piece, maintains protection of the frontal c pawn and screens off the d file to allow queenside castling.} 11. Bf4 {11. Bf4 - doubly attacks dsb so I castle queenside, getting my queen rook into play, protecting dsb and challenging the d file.} O-O-O 12. Rd2 Ne7 {12. ........ Ne7 - white is preparing to double rooks on the d file so I now develop my queen knight and connect my rooks.} 13. Rad1 Bxf4 {13. .......... Bxf4.  I decide to deviate from the game: ½-½, invincible1 (1890) vs. gnezz (2144).  Gnezz played Be5.  I rejected this move because I did not want an isolani as well as my doubleton on the c file.  I admit to following the database but I did assess each move very carefully before making the decision to play it and I chose the line which I felt best suited my style which I mentioned in an earlier note.  In hindsight though, would Be5 have been a better move than the one I chose?} 14. Nxf4 Bf7 {14. ............ Bf7 - after white recaptured on f4 I backed my bishop off to f7, moving it out of range of the knight on f5 and contesting control of the d5 square.} 15. Nfd5 Nxd5 16. Nxd5 Bxd5 17. Rd2xd5 Rxd5 18. Rxd5 Rd8 19. Rxd8+ Kxd8 {19. ............... Kxd8.  After I moved my bishop off to f7, white replied with 15. Nfd5.  This triggered off a plethora of exchanges ending in the position I have now.  The king and pawn ending that I mentioned in an earlier note.  My position is about to go way down south!  I am just wondering whether, instead of contesting the d file with my rook I would have been better served by playing b6 to back up my frontal c pawn and then playing my rook to e8 putting pressure on e5.  You the jury decide!} 20. c4 {20.  c4 - stopping my king from advancing too far up the board to counter-attack.} Ke7 21. f4 Kf7 {21. ............ Kf7 - letting my opponent come to me - but I wonder if there was anything better.} 22. Kf2 g6 23. Kf3 h6 24. Kg4 c6 {24. .......... c6 - in hindsight I am wondering whether it would have been better to have left the pawn where it was, on c7 it was stopping a wk incursion on d6.} 25. f5 Kg7 {25. ......... Kg7?  - would h4  have been a better plan here?} 26. h4 {26. h4 - not expecting this.  I was expecting 26. fxg6 Kxg6, 27. Kf5 b6 28. e5 - then after the exchange of pawns the white king cannot be prevented from gobbling up my queenside pawns!} g5 27. hxg5 hxg5 {27. .......... hxg5 - getting rid of the side pawns.} 28. Kh5 {28. Kh5 - strong move, planning to get at the f pawn via g6.  I try to prevent this with Kh7.} Kh7 29. g4 Kg7 {29. ............. Kg7 - maintaining the guard on f6 and h6.} 30. e5 fxe5 {30. .......... fxe5 - was Kf7 any better?} 31. Kxg5 Kf7 32. b3 b5 33. a4 bxa4 34. bxa4 a5 35. Kh4 {35. Kh4 - here I was expecting f6 - WK could catch up with the e pawn and snaffle it.  Although the f and g (the g pawn could be used to decoy the black king onto the g file) pawns may fall the WK could get to the queenside before the BK and gobble up all my queenside pawns.} Kf6 36. Kg3 Kg5 37. Kf3 Kf6 {37. ..... Kf6 - stopping the f pawn's advance and guarding the e5 pawn, but for how long?} 38. Ke4 {38. Ke4 - here I resigned due to impending ruinous loss of material.  I am now in Zugzwang - any move I make now will result in the e pawn dropping off.  If I play Kg5 I will be able to take Paolo's g pawn in exchange but he will then crown his f pawn.  So there ends the lesson.  }
