1. e4 {We all used this move, back then...} e5 {...and almost always replied with this.} 2. f4 {This wasn't at all uncommon among us. We'd usually accept on the Black side.} Bc5 {I decided to vary from the norm, just for the hell of it.} 3. fxe5 {T. M. seizes the unprotected KP.} Qh4+ {Anytime I could safely play Q-R5 ch, I figured good things would follow.} 4. g3 {Blocking off the check...} Qxe4+ {...but now he's in trouble.} 5. Ne2 {It hardly matters at this point...} Qxh1 {This gives me a winning material advantage, if the game gets far enough for it to matter.} 6. b3 {Playing out the string.} Qxh2 {Taking the free Pawn.} 7. Bb2 {Completing his fianchetto and guarding the advanced Pawn.} Bf2# {Finishing the game elegantly.}
