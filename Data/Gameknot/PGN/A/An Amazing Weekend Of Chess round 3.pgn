1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bd3 Be7 5. e5 Nfd7 6. f4 c5 {Returning to an opening I really like. I have a huge feeling that my opponent wasn't familiar with this opening considering the way he played this game} 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. Be3 a6 {Now here's where the twist comes in. So far this game has been very even. Only a strange stupid move could change everything. But of course.....} 9. Nb1 {(??) I understand he was thinking of c3 and Nd2, but definitely wrong time. The game fell apart for him because of this move.} Qb6 {Wins either the d4 pawn or the b2 pawn.} 10. Qc1 {I guess it's going to be the d4 pawn. Now I want to count how many times his pieces have to move back.} cxd4 {Taking with the knight was definitely not as good.} 11. Bf2 {Bd2 seems much better (move back counter: 1)} Nc5 {Now I have a huge attack, and this is only the oppening. Taking the free pawn loses a piece after Nxd3.} 12. Nbd2 {Trying to develop in this horrible situation.} Nb4 {Attacking d3 and keeping a huge offense.} 13. Be2 {Moving away from the coming attack (move back counter: 2)} d3 {(!) An excellent move the pawn can't be taken or the queen will be lost. After the long combo, you may wonder if after Kd1 that both queens will be gone after Bxb6. The correct move there is not to take the queen, but play Nxf2, and black wins.} 14. Bd1 {White has been playing horribly, now everything is stuck. (move back counter: 3)} dxc2 {(!) Wins the queen no matter what. At this point he resigned and now I had a score of 3/3. Later, 2 other guys won and also had 3/3. One was a little kid rated 3rd in my section, and the other an old man who I played when I was very little, who beat me by playing extremely slow knowing that I would fall asleep since it was midnight. Ever since then, I've been dying to get my revenge (hint hint).}
