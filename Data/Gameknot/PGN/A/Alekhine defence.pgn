1. e4 Nf6 {Hi all again. This game shows how not to play Alekhine defence. I'm not good in it but my opponent makes some mistakes which help me to beat him for 10 moves only} 2. e5 Nd5 3. Bc4 {More popular continuations I think are 2.c4 or 2.d4} Nb6 4. Bb3 {The bishop threaten on f7 is one of my favourites } Nc6 {Already mistake I think. ...d6 is better} 5. Nf3 d6 6. Bxf7+ {Maybe the most popular sacrifice in the openings} Kxf7 7. Ng5+ Ke8 {are g6 or g8 better?} 8. e6 {On that pole the pawn is very strong. Actually Black has not useful move already. If Ne5 then d4 } Nd5 9. Nf7 Bxe6 10. Nxd8 {Black did many mistakes in this game. }
