1. e4 {As usual, the King's Pawn Opening.} c5 {And, my response to the last opening.} 2. Nf3 {Of course, he decides to respond with the cornerstone of the Open Sicilian.  I understand that because I also would have responded with this move, if my opponent had played 2...c5.} d6 {The continuation of the Sicilian Defense.  Of course, I do not know other variations of this Defense.} 3. Bc4 {I understand why he played this.  In this position, he is developing.  However, 3.d4 was best as it is the continuation of the Open Siclian.  This, however, will not become an Open or Closed Siclian.} a6 {This is still a continuation of the Siclian.  I like this version this is best because it prevents him from playing 4.Bb5+} 4. d4 {Now, he is trying to enter the Open Sicilian Variation, but this should have been played sooner.  As I had mentioned earlier, this is not an Open Sicilian.} Bg4 {That does not bother me because I am still going to develop.  However, this is not best.  Instead, I should have played 4...Nf6, or 4...Nc6 because it is said that you are supposed to develop Knights before Bishops.  That is because you know where the K is placed but not the B.} 5. dxc5 {This is often played with the Open Siclian, so this is very similar to that variation.  However, it is still not an Open Siclian.  Note: timing is critical, and playing something by move 2 or 4, determines what kind of opening it is called.  At least, that is what I think but could be wrong.} Nd7 {? I should have thought better then this.  I am clearly trying to develop.  However, this is a mistake because I placed my knight in a bad spot, and it is the wrong knight.  As I always demonstrate, it is not a good idea to block your own pieces.  Therefore, 2...Nc6, or 2...Nf6 were better.  However, 2...Nf6 is better then 2...Nc6 because I want to be able to castle on the right wing, as opposed to the left wing (Kingside Castling, instead of, Queenside Castling.)  However, 5...dxc5 was best because it gets back a pawn.  As a result, I inadvertently gave away a free pawn, and it is not a gambit or a deflective sacrifice.  Note: Jack Stockel would say, "Don't give things away".} 6. c3 {!? I do not know why he played this, but it is risky.  Why?  In this position, he will have trouble developing his b1 Knight, unless he places it on the rim (plays Na3).  Having said that, I am also not in very good shape, due to lack of developing.  Note: My right wing (Kingside) is completely undeveloped.  Now, he has an edge because he has the opportunity to castle, but I do not, yet.  However, this move will delay some of his development.} dxc5 {In the meantime, I decide to take advantage by doing what I had missed a move ago, as I had mentioned earlier.  What am I talking about?  I decide to take back his pawn.  Now, I am very lucky that he did not see mistake.  Why?  In this position, he could have played 6.cxd6, and then I am down a pawn.  Instead, he makes a bigger mistake by cramming his b1 Knight, as I had mentioned earlier.  } 7. Qd5 {He decides to bring his Queen out because of his attempt to mate in one.  This is very similar to and reminds me of SM (Scholars Mate).  Now, I am not going to be intimated.  Like my second game against blitzkov, I am going to kick his Queen, with my Knight.  This move, however, is a mistake that I am not going to make.  Therefore, what am I going to do?  That will be explained in a little while.} Nb6 8. Qg5 Bxf3 {As he runs back, I decide to take his Knight.  I am hoping for an exchange because I want to exchange my Knight, for his LSB, for some reason.  I know, once again, I am still obsessed with trying to get a Knight Fork, somehow.  It could take a very long time, but that will not happen.  Instead, he is going to make a very big mistake, that will cost him the game, momentarily.} 9. Qf5 {?? As they say, "THIS IS IT!  The moment that you've been waiting for."  This is his loosing blunder.  Instead, 9.gxf3 would have saved the game, but, "This looses immediately", as Mr. Stockel would say.  He is still trying to mate me in one, but I am going to do that, myself.  How?  With a B&Q mate, and it is the most common type of mate, in chess.  In fact, these are the most dangerous pieces when combined.  BTW, my last two sentences are based on what Jack Stockel has taught me.  Because of this move, I will mate him with 9...Qd1#, and I was not planning on this mate in one.  That is why this annotation is called an Unplanned Mate in One.    } Qd1# {In general, I would rather mate in one by not planning on it, and even miss on mating opportunities, then plan on mating someone.  That is because you usually loose when you plan to mate in one because it often comes in the form of unsound aggression or cheap tricks.  Or, you are forced to work to win a game, that you should really loose.  However, the other way does not force you to struggle.  For example, I mated my opponent very easily, this time.}
