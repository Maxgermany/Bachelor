1. e4 {This is a brilliant game which arises after a the wild Danish Gambit which is rapidly becoming a favourite of mine. 1.e4 The best opening move in my opinion. This was the most common opening move in the 19th century and still is today according to the GK Database. As Bobby Fischer once said "best by test." Another great exponent of 1.e4 was the best player of all time in my opinion Paul Morphy.} e5 2. d4 {This is the center game. This attempts to rip open the centre by exchanging pawns. However white opts not to make the more 'sound' move 3. Qxd4. He decideds to play a romantic gambit instead. } exd4 {This is the best move. 2...d6 is posible which transposes into a philidor which is a fairly average defence in my opinion and is now not seen at GM level.} 3. c3 {The Danish Gambit is to follow. However this move signifies the start of the Goering Gambit. White will sacrifice one or two pawns for the sake of rapid development and the attack. With care, Black can accept one or both pawns but I express with great care. Black can decline the gambit safely but that's just boring In my opinion, so accept and test your defensive skills I say.} dxc3 {Day is no spoil sport he accepts the second pawn.} 4. Bc4 {The Danish Gambit. White will sacrifice one or two pawns for the sake of rapid development and the attack. With care, Black can accept one or both pawns but I can't express enough WITH GREAT CARE! Black can decline the gambit safely but that's just boring In my opinion, so accept and test your defensive skills I say.} cxb2 {He accepts the exchange. You can tell this game is going to get fun now!} 5. Bxb2 {Already you can see that here whites position is much better. He is nearly fully developed and is almost ready to launch an attack. Another thing that you can see is that the majority of whites Queenside pawns have been eliminated. This is the main weakness in the DG because if it gets into an endgame black has the advantage because of the Q-side majority. However it is a rather double edged sword because the pawns have been sacrificed white starts setting a very powerful attack. Black on the other hand has not developed a single piece.} Bb4+ {This is a common move which aims to pin the knight so he can attack the e4-pawn. However the best move would have been 5... d5 6. Bxd5 Nf6 7. Bxf7  Kxf7 8. Qxd8 Bb4  9. Qd2 Bxd2  10. Nxd2. With a balanced endgame with maybe a slight edge to black in the endgame.} 6. Nc3 d6 {This opens a diagonal for his light squared bishop. It also sets black to play Nf6 at some point, without d6 Nf6 would be weak because of the e4-e5 push of the pawn.} 7. Qb3 {This is a fairly thematic move in the DG aiming at the f7 pawn while also attacking the bishop.} Bxc3+ {Black decides to exchange which is probably his only option as if he retreats he loses a tempo. He could however of played 7...Nc6.} 8. Bxc3 {Another possitive effect 7.Qb3 has done it has locked the light squared bishop to the back rank defending the b7 pawn. The key aim for white is to gain a massive advantage in development and then involve all hi pieces in a final mating attack.} Qg5 {?! This is meant to be some type of counter attack on the g2 pawn. A better move would have been to develop one of his pieces, or playing his queen to d7.} 9. Bxf7+ {The pawn is hanging so Blackburne may as well take it and shorten his material disadvantage.} Kf8 10. Nf3 {This develops a piece, prepares to castle kingisde and threatens black's queen gaining another precious tempo. } Qg4 {This move aims to attack the e4 pawn but white's next move deems the attack useless. Better would have been 10...Qe7. If he took the g2 pawn then blacks queen might become fairly passive, which is not very good as it is one of the only developed pieces black can use to defend.} 11. O-O {! I like this move because it contains a positional trap which defends the capture of the e4 pawn without moving a piece to defend it. If you have not already spotted it, if 11...Qxe4 12. Rf-e1 and White has a very powerful attack which will either result in mate or at the expense of material for black.} Nh6 {This move attacks the bishop and therefore forces it to move. Black feels this is important because or the threat of mate on the back rank.} 12. Bc4 {Black achieves this for now but the bishop is still in a powerful attacking position.} Nc6 {This is amazing. Black is still developing his pieces while white is already fully developed with a safe king and a powerful attack.} 13. e5 {White pushes a pawn trying to open one of the central files.} dxe5 14. Nxe5 Nxe5 15. Bxe5 Qg5 {Black tries to fend of white's bishop again.} 16. Rfe1 {White defends with the rook while putting his rook on an incredibly powerful square.} Nf5 {?! Black tries to get his knight involved but completely forgets his hanging pawn on c7.} 17. Bxc7 {White is now equal in material and is in a won position.} Bd7 18. Qb4+ {! This starts white on a combination which is almost entirely forced.} Ne7 {Only possible move.} 19. Rxe7 {! This sets up the skewer with the bisho when black takes with his queen, which by the way is forced the only other option which is very respectable in a such a position is 19... 1-0!} Qxe7 20. Bd6 {!} Qxd6 21. Qxd6+ Ke8 22. Re1+ Kd8 {Forced} 23. Re7 {Threatens 23.Qxd7  mate.} Kc8 {Forced} 24. Qxd7+ Kb8 25. Qxb7# {I think you will agree with me when i say this is a wonderful game which shows the importance of rapid development of pieces even at the expense of a couple of pawns. I wish Paul Morphy had played this openings as white because he would have created games just as good as this if not even better because he truly understood the power of development.. I hope you liked this game as much as I did. If you have any feed back or any complaints on mistakes you've spotted please PM me. Oh yes one more thing if you enjoyed this game then I recommend you look at my annotated game called 'Naval intelligence' which involves the Evan's Gambit which is a lot similar to the DG. It offers a good intro to the opening. Cheers Tom}
