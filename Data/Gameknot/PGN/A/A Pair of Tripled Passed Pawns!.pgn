1. e4 {[Oh yeah... this is an idea borrowed from Joanne/jstevens1, but if you want to follow GK analysis of this game, here's the link; http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14707612&rnd=0.3184220970356586 - As a bonus, I'll throw in the second game I had with starforce49, which I lost; http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14707613&fb=1&rnd=0.3867511537905609] } e5 {[This game is also about a week old - real life and some tough games in the 'Traxler with Nxf7' mini-tournament delayed its release] } 2. Nf3 d6 {Philador's Defence - not one I really like to go up against as White (personal preference) but then again, I do know that the infamous Legal's Mate can also arise from this position. With this in mind, my next developing  moves were obvious to me } 3. Bc4 h6 4. Nc3 c6 {Well, it looks like that that will never happen, especially with Black's 4...c6. However, Black needs to be careful - he has no developed pieces against White's three. Furthermore, what was the purpose of 3...h6? } 5. d4 {! an open board favours the more developed side in the opening, so I had no qualms with this move! } exd4 {Black decides to exchange... though I don't think this was the right move to play - Black is still behind in development! Nf6, Be7 or Bg4 would have been better. } 6. Qxd4 {Meanwhile, White is able to develop another piece off the back rank, and has no fear of being chased away by the knight because of Black's own pawn on c6. } Qe7 {?! Black develops his own queen, though to a strange square. I still like Nf6 or Bg4 for Black. } 7. Bf4 {I develop my last minor piece... and already has ideas for an attack. My last move was a big clue, but can you guess where the attack will come? } Be6 {This must have been the intention behind Black's last move... } 8. O-O-O {! Already, Black's in trouble - with all the pressure on the weak d6 pawn, something's got to give! Black's only option is to give up the pawn, because it cannot be defended no matter how hard Black tries! } Bxc4 {?! Trading pieces in view of a powerful attack is understandable, but I'm not so sure about this move. After White recaptures with his queen, there would be two Black pieces defending d6, and two White pieces attacking it... but since Black's first defender is the queen, that fact doesn't matter. Furthermore, it allows me to keep my queen, which could be useful for an attack on the exposed king. } 9. Qxc4 Na6 {Nothing much Black can do in this situation really, but perhaps Nf6 would have been better? (sorry to sound like a broken record with the Nf6 move :P) } 10. Bxd6 {!? Of course... well, it seemed obvious at the time. The GK analysis machine prefers the rook capture, which would allow Rhd1 next move, and I did consider that, but I chose this move due to the tempo attack on the queen } Qe6 {Black wants to exchange queens... Normally, I would avoid an exchange like that, but here I saw that the exchange could actually benefit me... and not just the queen exchange! } 11. Qxe6+ fxe6 12. Bxf8 Kxf8 13. Rd7 {With those two exchanges, White has now established a rook on the seventh rank and enjoys a positional, as well as a material advantage. Needless to say, I was feeling optimistic at this point } Nc5 {The best move in this position - not only does it defend the b7 pawn, it also chases away the rook! } 14. Rc7 {Forced if White wants to keep his influence on the seventh rank... } Nf6 {...but has he pushed too far? I thought so at first too, when I saw what Black was threatening (15...Ne8! wins the c7 rook) but it didn't take me long to find... } 15. Ne5 {! Forced, but powerful all the same! Now if 15...Ne8 then 16.Ng6+ Kg8 17.Re7 Rh7 18.b4 works out great for White! Black ends up trying a different approach instead...  } Na6 {? but perhaps he forgot about the pawn on b7? White is actually forced to capture it now... } 16. Rxb7 {...and now that the b7 pawn has fallen, the pawn on c6 is also up for grabs! However, Ng6+ is still threatened! } Rh7 {?! I like the idea of moving the king better - all this seems to do is restrict Black's rook } 17. Nxc6 {yum-yum! :) But White isn't full yet - he's had the main course, and now eyes the a7 pawn for dessert - there is nothing that Black can do to save it! (17...g5 18.Rxh7 Nxh7 19.Nb5) } Nc5 {A counter-attack on the e4 pawn seems like a reasonable idea for Black, but as I'll show later on, there's a catch! } 18. Rxa7 Rxa7 {Interesting... usually, it is advisable for the losing side to not exchange pieces like this, but I guess that Black just wanted to get rid of the menace that was the seventh-rank rook! } 19. Nxa7 Nfxe4 {Black manages to get back a pawn... } 20. Nxe4 Nxe4 21. Re1 Nc5 {...but only temporarily! [Nxf2?? Rf1!] It's true that the knight is defending the pawn right now, but it can't keep that defence! } 22. b4 {! } Na4 23. Rxe6 {+4 in material, I should have no problem winning at this point, especially with the tripled passed pawns that I have queenside... but I didn't give my advancement of my pawns justice - I could have done it much better, and later, Black misses a chance to eliminate my passed pawns! How? You'll see... ;) } g5 {A discovered attack on my knight... } 24. Nc6 {...so I retreat it } h5 {What else does Black have? there isn't even a pawn majority kingside! White, however, has his queenside pawns... } 25. c4 Nb6 26. c5 Nd5 27. b5 {? White ends up over stretching himself here. Better would have either been 27.a4 or 27.Kb2 [because believe me, I sorely missed having my king for defence later on!] } Nc7 {! A knight fork on my rook and pawn, and White loses a point in material no matter what he does (28.Rf6+ Kg7 doesn't work) Once the rook moves, Black snatches the b5 pawn, disconnecting my two remaining queenside pawns. Despite still having a sizeable advantage, I started to get nervous, mainly because I would hate to lose a game with +4 in material and tripled passed pawns! } 28. Nd4 {!? I was going to lose a point anyway, so I do it on my own terms! I chose to lose a rook for a knight and pawn instead of just losing a pawn in order to keep my queenside pawns intact, but it'd be interesting to hear what readers think of this move... comments are welcome :) } Nxe6 29. Nxe6+ {This fork nets me the pawn on g5 } Ke8 {The best move - the king will be needed to halt the flow of the queenside pawns! } 30. Nxg5 Re7 {I was hoping that Black might try 30...Rg7, where I could set up a trap with 31.b6 [if Black takes the knight,  the b-pawn will promote] This move proves useful to Black later on } 31. b6 Kd8 32. c6 Kc8 {My b and c pawns have both advanced a square, and are both only two squares away from promotion. The king stops promotion for now, but once my a-pawn gets into the action, Black will be powerless surely? } 33. a4 {? Logical, it seemed to me, but the GK database labels this a 'mistake.' My advantage goes from a +5 to a +2... ouch! 33.f4 was preferred here, which prevents Black's next move... } Re5 {! Both attacking the knight and preparing the fork Rc5+ - one of White's passed pawns will be lost! } 34. Nf7 Rc5+ 35. Kd2 {White wishes to avoid any similar forks in the future - Black's rook will have no reason to check White's king } Rxc6 36. a5 {Those passed pawns are still White's biggest asset, so naturally, White will be using them... } Rc5 {? Black realises that too, but ironically, him trying to attack them has just pushed up White's advantage once again! The right move was 36...Rf6! - the knight must retreat, meaning it can't help with the queenside pawn's advancement. Meanwhile, the Black king can hold off the passed pawns, while Black's rook starts attacking the pawns kingside } 37. a6 {Onward! } Ra5 {Rb5?? runs straight into the knight fork Nd6+!, so Black goes after the other pawn... } 38. a7 {? but Nd6+ should still have been played here! 38.Nd6+ Kb8 39.a7+ Ka8 40.Ne8, pretty much what happened in this game. I had been expecting Ra6, where 39.Nd6+, followed by b7 would settle matters... } Kb7 {? Black plays this move instead, which doesn't fare much better. What he should have played first was 38...Ra2+!, as if he had played that... } 39. Nd6+ {...the Black king could take the pawn on b6! here, Kxb6+ falls to the fork Nc4+, which Ra2+ would have prevented. Of course, the a7 pawn would have fallen as well, along with my self-esteem! Now White wins... } Ka8 40. Ne8 {! Like this - Black can do nothing to stop Nc6+ } Rc5 {Quite a few other people may have resigned at this point, but Black is willing to fight on! Still, I would have played Rd5+, followed by Rc5+, and once the king reaches the rook [Obviously White doesn't want to draw] it would go to d2 or c2 where it attacks the kingside pawns. } 41. Nc7+ {Now White recovers his queen! } Kb7 42. a8=Q+ Kxb6 43. Ne6 {Now that White has an easy win, the question is; how best to do this? White still has a pawn and rook which could prove to make things difficult for White, but thanks to my three remaining pawns I can take care of both of these pieces easily... } Rc6 44. Nd8 Rd6+ 45. Kc3 Kc7 46. Qa5+ {First, White gives up his knight to take the pawn... } Kd7 47. Qxh5 Kxd8 {Although I've never encountered a 'Rook vs Queen' endgame, it is my understanding that it's a difficult one to win, especially when the king and rook are close together like this. However, like I've already mentioned my three pawns means that I don't have to deal with this... } 48. Qh4+ {With this move, I can force the rook off the board no matter what Black does! } Ke8 49. Qe4+ Kf7 50. Qf4+ Rf6 51. Qxf6+ {! And now Black has no hope - his king will not be able to stop my new set of three connected passed pawns!  } Kxf6 {The rest is simple } 52. h4 Kf5 53. h5 Kg5 54. g4 Kh6 55. f4 Kg7 56. g5 Kf7 57. f5 Kg7 58. f6+ Kh7 59. f7 Kg7 60. g6 Kf8 61. h6 Ke7 62. h7 Kf6 63. f8=Q+ {Say hello to Queen #1... } Ke5 64. h8=Q+ {...and Queen #2... } Ke6 65. g7 {and now I'm going for Queen #3 - I've never been able to do that before! At this point, Black resigned, and a couple of days later timeouts gave me my 1600+ rating! :) 1-0 }
