1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 Nd5 {New (for me). I shouldn't be good, but the truth it gets me away from known paths! Nice!} 3. Bg3 g6 4. e4 {Of course. } Nb6 {Now: can I take some advantage right now from the absence of the Kside N? Qf3? The problem is that the c5 square, where my lsb belongs, is now covered by that N. I didn't see anything valuable, so I developed normally.} 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. c3 {I can play c4, but this gives black counterplay on the diagonal I don't want to face. It's unknown territory, so I went for the scheme I play normally.} O-O 7. Nbd2 {I'm not in a hurry to castle. I'll save my lsb move for when it threats something. Just Be2 is possible and not bad, but... } d6 {Black plays for the minimum committement, so I have tempoes to use to press. How can I press him from this position?} 8. a4 {The idea is a5, kicking the N, so I can play Bc4 and try something using Ng4. I'm trying to prevent typical developement moves from black, that shield the white diagonal to f7.} a5 {Wisely, black uses a tempo to block me. The most aggressive move is...} 9. Nc4 {e4 is not attacked right now, so no harm in using this N to threat him. Of course, he can play Nb8-d7, so I won't exchange (the exchange would just have helped him to develop his N). } Nxc4 {...but he helped me a lot with this move, giving me a hand in developing on the square I need.} 10. Bxc4 Nd7 {He plans to exchange my lsb anyway.} 11. Qb3 Nb6 {Here I thought for a while on Bxf7, RxB, Ng4. This means two pieces for a R and pawn, and his K is opened and weak. Yes. BUT: can I bring into the attack other pieces, quickly, after the sac? I couldn't see it, so, for once, I didn't go for the more aggressive option. Was I right?} 12. Bd3 {Losing a tempo, but keeping my wonderful piece. } c6 {Supporting d5 if ever I threat to play e5. His Q is now dued to the defence of the Nb6, but this is hard to exploit for me at the moment. } 13. O-O {To castle "just to castle" is not good. But I needed more preparation. I didn't consider deeply enough Bh5. It pins the e pawn. f7 is pinned, too. The threat is Bxe7, QxB, QxN. What do you say? Was it sound? // If Ng4 now, he just plays h6. Nxf7, RxN leaves the R pinned, true, but I can't get it fast enough, and black can always play d5. So no good sacs, as far as I can see. } Be6 14. c4 {I can play this because of the Nf3. No matter my Q is where it is, as far as black is unable to get more firepower on c4... and he can't. Now I'm on to play d5, and b2 (that gets weak in return, but this is the cost of my c4 move) is defended. } Bg4 {He can't prevent d5, so thinks that BxN, doubling my pawns, will make me retreat the N (not to g4, but to d2. Nh5 looks weird, but maybe it has some points: f3-f4-f5 could be a plan for white. What do you think?} 15. c5 {I went for this one instead. I'm not concerned about doubling my pawns in front of the K. Black has no quick attack on it, and I don't want to play for an endgame. } dxc5 16. dxc5 {Finally, the N is away from b6!} Nd7 {The cost is that now it threats c5. I want to play the R on d1, but now it is not possible. } 17. Rac1 {I bring a R into play, and Rf will go to d1 or e1.} Be6 {Again! I'm not coordinating well enough my pieces, and I don't see any advantage from the opening. Now the real threat is on the pawn b2. My best move was 1) of course, not taking the b7 pawn, looking for c6. I sensed that Rb8 and Rxb2 would be enough compensation for black (was I right?). 2) Bc4, the natural move, is not playable due to Nxc5. I have to move the Q in a way it keeps all defended and is not easily kickable from. The right spot would have been Qa3. But I skipped step 2!!!!!} 18. Bc4 {??} Bxc4 {??? I am exaggerating, of course, but this means black has not kept in control my weaknesses. } 19. Rxc4 {Now I am frankly better. Everything is defended, and Rd1 is coming. } b6 {Only try black has. Unfortunately, Rd1, bxc5, and I can't use the pin right now, as if Rxc5, Nxc5, RxQ, NxQ... and I just have lost a R!} 20. cxb6 Qxb6 {Now I am going to lose a pawn, if I am not very careful. Now: a rated player (or myself in a non-blitz game) would have had to be able to calculate this position, and evaluate whether white is able to keep his pawns or not. Given "yes", white would have reached an equal endgame... not much!} 21. Qxb6 Nxb6 {If I defend a pawn, I lose another. So I went for revenge, instead. } 22. Rxc6 Nxa4 23. b3 {Pawn saved, material even. The black's N is not trapped. Sigh. (Or was it?)} Nc3 {Now black has Ne2+, I saw but underestimated. Not Rc1, of course, because of the fork, but... } 24. e5 {? this meant to lose the dsb. Not a good exchange, in an open endgame. Kh1 would have been a try.} Ne2+ 25. Kh1 Nxg3+ {Now: the principles say I had to retake with the h pawn: it opens an escape way for the K, it keeps f2 as a future supporter of e5... but I was looking for blood.} 26. fxg3 {I risked, in order to have the faint shadow of "something" against f7. I know, just a shot in the dark.} Rfb8 27. Rc7 {If I play for attack, I have to do it consequently. Ng4 right now could have been better, but I wanted the R on the 7th rank first. I sweared my opponent would have gone for the pawn instead, and after that I have still 4 moves before he can queen the a pawn... my attack will go faster (!?). Are you able to tell me if I was right?} Rxb3 28. Ng5 Rf8 29. Rxe7 {I think you should have been able to "see" this situation some moves before, and you should have been able to decide if and how white wins from here. Does he? Can you tell now? What's concrete white's threat, and does it work? Now it is very easy for black to spot the back rank mate that happens if I ever move Rf1 away from the 1st rank... without check. } a4 {Here he goes. } 30. Nxf7 {?? ...but what else? Maybe e6, but after fxe6, I have to play RxR+, and after KxR... I can't save my R and prevent Rb1#. // If now 30. RxN, I have no Re8+ (f8 is defended by the B) and I have no RxBg7+ helping me, so I have to play 31. Rexf7, Bxe5... and I have a losing endgame! // Thinking it twice, after all e6 was good if I retire my R (say a7), so to threat e7. // Of course, I thought I had "something" with the N, but I haven't: Nh6+ just provokes BxN, nothing more. Then I can play Ra1, trying to stop the pawn. Depressing... :-)} a3 {! Still better: what can I do? e6? Then how can I stop the a pawn? I'm already thinking in how to get to a drawn game with a minor piece less. My task is to be sure it will be just the N and the e pawn, nothing else. } 31. h4 {I opens an escape route for my K. } a2 {Black has almost won. Rb1 is the threat. And then, RxN. And then, Bxe5. } 32. Ra7 {The plan was: 32...RxN?, 33. Ra8+, Rf8, 34. Rf1xR+, and now I can take the a2 pawn and save myself. And if... } Rb1 {! I'm just lost. My move was...} 33. Rg1 {Nh6+, BxN, Rg1 (if Rxa2, RxR+ and I still have lost N and R). How could I have fallen for this with a lower rated player? Shame of me! Sill, let's go on. Now, how black wins, precisely?} Rxg1+ {? I counted on this one!} 34. Kxg1 Rxf7 {I've lost the N (and the e5 pawn) for the dangerous pawn. But I have a pawn, and, as they say: remove pawns and equal pieces: what's left? A draw!} 35. Ra8+ {Just to gain some extra seconds. } Rf8 36. Rxa2 Bxe5 {g3 is threatened. } 37. Kh2 {My K belongs to h3, looking for g4 under some circunstances. But more than that: my ONLY strenght can spread from the combined force of my K and pawns against his. I have to be aware of nasty Rh1# situations in the future, but th only other option is to be slowly squeezed to death. } Kg7 38. Ra7+ {This was really "strategy". I know that he thinks that his K will become a supporter for his pawns, and he wants to go into the game. So I though he will take this as a mistake, and wouldn't go for Rf7 (I think that with a B, Black will win the engame by double-threating g3 with some manouver). } Kh6 {Yes. Now his K has few squares to move on, and black is far to double the attack on g3. Those are my advantages. My plan is to get black into a mate net. Can you see it? It happened in the game, so I' won't tell you! :-)} 39. Kh3 Rd8 {Threats to double the threat on g3, and I haveno inmediate counterplay for it, as it would be check. If g4, Rd3+ and I have to play g3, Rxg3+, and I'm lost. } 40. Re7 {Desperately: I will hunt his B on every square of the diagonal from where it threats g3. He will have to break the draw! Was I right? } Bb8 41. Rb7 {The R can't threat g3... and I doubt it will ever can! The only way was for white to have Re3 and Be1. But can black force me to allow it? This is a question for high-rated players, for once! :-)} Be5 42. Re7 Bd6 {This allows a free move, since black can't double the threat on g3 in one move. What to do with this tempo? Just go on for a drawn? } 43. Rf7 {I played this because from this square my R can block a check or a threat on g3 with R, and if black exchanged, with the undoubled pawns, I believed a draw could be achieved. Was I right?} Rf8 {He wants to exchange R. But in doing so, he puts his R on a bad column, because now it can't threat g3 in a move. This gives me more freedom. } 44. Rd7 Be5 45. Re7 Bg7 {Black is desperate: in advantage, and unable to materialize a win. After such a successful game against a higer-rated player! So he tried this. I played... guess the move I wanted to play for so many moves and I couldn't because of R3+ would have lost me? Now not the B nor the R are in position to double attack or check anything in a move. And this is all what I need to set a...} 46. g4 {...mate net on the BK. Can you see it? Can you even believe it? For a beginner, this can be a bit of a lesson as how to get the most even of a seemengly lost position. I dreamt of this position form the moment I played Kh3, and played based on it for the moves since then. Accordingly, even if you are in advantage, still be aware of possible own's weaknesses. I black plays, say, g4, he is saved and can still win or draw. But with...} Rf1 {...this move (do you remember I warned you white will be have to be aware of Rh1 checks or mate nets? I was. Here, black just has no time!). This is the last chance for the beginner to spot the mate, if he/she hasn't yet. :-)} 47. g5+ Kh5 48. g4# {Did you dream to play this well known mate pattern sometimes in your life? :-D}
