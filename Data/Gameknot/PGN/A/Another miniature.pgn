[Opening "KGA (C34), Fischer defence"]

1. e4 {I kick off with 1.e4, my favorite first move as it may leads to wild and tactical play.} e5 2. f4 {King's Gambit. I sacrifice a pawn for faster development.} exf4 {King gambit accepted.} 3. Nf3 {Main line so far.} d6 {Black responds with the Fisher Defense.} 4. d4 {I grab the the center with my queen's pawn. I also attack Black's f4 pawn.} Bg4 {Black creates an annoying pin on my knight.} 5. Bxf4 {I take the free pawn.} Nd7 6. Bc4 {I aim for f7, the weak square in Black's camp.} Bxf3 {? This is a mistake, as it exchanges a piece that has moved twice for a piece that has moved only once. Such notions are essential in sharp game like these! } 7. Qxf3 {Here is the consequence of Black's last move: I have 3 developed pieces for Black's knight. My queen also aims for the f7 square. } Ne7 {Another mistake. The king suffocates behind his pieces.} 8. O-O {!? I missed the following tactical shot: 8.Bxd6! f6 (8...cxd6 9.Bxf7#) 9.Qb3 Qb7, with a superior position. However, Castling here is not a mistake, as it doesn't compromise my game in any way.} g6 {?? This is just too slow. Black completely ignores the threat on f7. Although mate is NOT forced from here, can you find the winning solution for white?} 9. Bxf7+ {! Step 1: The sac!} Kxf7 {Forced.} 10. Bg5+ {! Step 2: The discovery! Black has no viable answers to this attack.} Ke6 {?? The best move was 10...Nf6 11.Qxf6+ Ke8 12.Qxh8. 10...Nf5 fails to 11.Bxg8. However, any king move leads to...} 11. Qf7# {11.Qf7#  1-0}
