1. e4 {Annotations by Philidor from Black's perspective. } e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 f5 {It is always advantageous to change your king's bishop's pawn for his king's pawn, because, by that means, your king's and queen's pawns may place may place themselves in the centre of the chess-board; besides, in castling on the right wing, your castle finds itself free and able to act from the very beginning of the game, as will be shown by a back-game on the same play. } 4. d3 c6 5. exf5 {If your adversary refuse taking your bishop's pawn, you are still to leave it exposed, and not move it till he has castled; you must afterwards, with your pawns on the right wing; form your attack upon the pawns which cover his king, as is explained in a back-game on that move. You are to observe, as a general rule, not to determine easily to push on the pawns on either wing before your adversary's king has castled, because he will otherwise retire on the side where your pawns are less advanced, and consequently less able to annoy him. } Bxf5 6. Bg5 Nf6 7. Nbd2 {Should he take your knight with his bishop, you must take his with your pawn, in order to bring the strength of your pawns towards the centre. } d5 8. Bb3 Bd6 {This is the best square your king's bishop can choose, except the fourth of your queen's bishop: in that place he may be of use in forming your attack upon the king's castle's pawn, in case he should castle on his left side. } 9. Qe2 Qe7 10. O-O {If he had castled on his queen's side, it would then have been your play to castle on your king's side, in order to attack him afterwards more easily with the pawns on your left. Again, it being necessary to observe, as a general rule, that, as it is often dangerous to attack the adversary too soon, here likewise you must be reminded not to be too hasty in your attack, until your pawns are previously sustained by one another, and also by your pieces, otherwise those premature attacks will be unsuccessful, as will be shown by a back-game on this play. } Nbd7 11. Nh4 {He plays the knight to make room for his king's bishop's pawn, with a design next to advance it two squares to try to break the line of your pawns. } Qe6 12. Nxf5 {If he had pushed his king's bishop's pawn two squares, instead of taking your bishop, you should then have attacked his queen with your queen's bishop, and then pushed your king's castle's pawn upon his bishop, to force him to take your knight; in this case, your best way would be to take his bishop with your pawn, in order the better to support your king's pawn, and replace it in case it be taken. } Qxf5 13. Bxf6 {If he did not take this knight, his bishop would remain imprisoned by your pawns, or he would lose three moves, which loss would entirely ruin his game. } gxf6 14. f4 Qg6 15. fxe5 fxe5 16. Rf3 {He plays this castle with the design either to attack and remove your queen or to double it, if necessary, with his other castle. } h5 {You play this pawn two squares, to give room to your queen, in case your adversary attack her with his king's castle. } 17. Raf1 O-O-O 18. c4 e4 {Here is a move as difficult to comprehend as to be well explained; in the first place you are to observe, that when you find yourself with a string of pawns following one another, the pawn which is at the head of them must strive to preserve its post; your king's pawn not being upon the same coloured squares, or in an oblique line with the others, your adversary has pushed his queen's bishop's pawn, for two reasons: the first, to induce you to advance your queen's pawn, which would then be stopped by that of his queen, and, by that means, to render useless your king's pawn thus left behind: the second is, to prevent, at the same time, your king's bishop from battering upon his king's castle's pawn. You ought, therefore, to push your king's pawn upon his castle, and even sacrifice it, because your adversary, by taking it, opens a free passage to the pawn of your queen, which you are to advance immediately, and sustain, in case of need, with your others, in order order to try to make a queen with it, or draw some other considerable advantage from it, to win the game. It is true, that his queen's pawn being now on the same line with its king, appears to have the same advantage of having no opposition from your pawns to make a queen; however, the difference is great, because his pawn being entirely separated and incapable of being joined to, or sustained by, any of the others, will always be in danger of being seized on is road by your pieces continually warring against it. This move, as has been before observed, is very difficult; and one must be already a good player to judge well of it. } 19. dxe4 d4 20. Bc2 Ne5 {It was necessary to play this knight, in order to stop his king's pawn; the more so, because this very pawn, in its present situation, stops the passage of its own bishop, and even of its knight. } 21. Rf3f6 Qg7 22. Qf2 {He plays his queen, in order afterwards to give check, but, if, instead of playing her, he had pushed his king's castle's pawn, to hinder the attack of your knight, you must have pushed your queen's pawn one square, which would have insured you the game. } Ng4 23. Qf5+ Kb8 24. Rxd6 {He takes this bishop to save his king's castle's pawn; besides, that bishop proves more incommodious to him than all your other pieces, and by this play he keeps your queen's castle in check with his queen. } Rxd6 25. Qf4 Qe5 {Having the advantage of a castle against a bishop, towards the end of a party, you will gain by exchanging queens; because his queen is troublesome to you in her present situation, and to avoid the check-mate, he finds himself under the necessity of taking her. } 26. Qxe5 Nxe5 27. Rf5 Ng4 28. c5 Rg6 29. Nc4 Ne3 30. Nxe3 dxe3 31. Rf3 Rd8 {You must make yourself master of the openings, to bring the castles into play, especially at the latter end of the game. } 32. Rxe3 Rd2 {Whatever else he had played, he could not prevent you from doubling your castles, without losing his bishop, or suffering you to make a queen with your pawn. }
