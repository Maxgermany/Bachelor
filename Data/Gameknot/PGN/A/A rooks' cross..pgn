[Opening "Bird's opening (A02)"]

1. f4 b6 {An uncompromising answer to an uncommon opening. } 2. d4 Bb7 3. e3 e6 4. Nf3 {The cleared long diagonal is always interesting to play with. } c5 {Important, to make some space for my pieces. } 5. c3 {So, no space allowed. } Nf6 6. Bd3 Nc6 {Just developement. I was not sure about where to go with the d pawn, so better to develop and wait. } 7. Nbd2 {White's dsb is trapped in, but I couldn't see how to make something of it. } cxd4 {No space? Well, let's take some. } 8. exd4 Qc7 9. g3 {Er... wonderful! All the white diagonal to me! } d6 {I want to prepare a center break, taking advatage of the pinned knight on f3. } 10. Qe2 {Interesting... let's solve this pin first. } O-O-O 11. O-O {So no pin anymore on the knight. Of course. But still a good diagonal. } Re8 {My rook is undefended, there, but soon it will be. In any case, a piece would stay on e5 no matter what the exchanges are, so why not. } 12. Ba6 {I loved my bishop, but sigh, I cannot take care of everything. } e5 {Let's go with my plan, then. } 13. fxe5 dxe5 14. Bxb7+ Kxb7 {I needm my queen to guard e5. } 15. dxe5 Bc5+ {Just developing the dsb...} 16. Kh1 Ng4 {Remembering the Budapest. } 17. Ne4 Ngxe5 {Better was Nc6xe5, in sight of the following move} 18. Nxc5+ bxc5 19. Qb5+ Qb6 {No kiddning and no joking. I'll leave white out of steam. } 20. Qxb6+ axb6 {So, this is acceptable with black against a 1800+} 21. Nxe5 Nxe5 {Necessary to defend f7. } 22. Bf4 f6 {Mistake! Nd3 wins a pawn, and forces the white bishop to retire. } 23. Rad1 {Even better. If I remove my knight, white's rook penetrates. } Re7 {Just to avoid Rd7+, but without exchanging too many rooks, just for the sake of an interesting game. } 24. Rd5 Nc4 {Necessary, since otherwise I cannot stop white to double rooks on d. } 25. b3 g5 {Too late, and it leaves me with the f7 pawn undefended. } 26. Bc1 {A bishop is better than a knight in this kind of endgame. } Ne3 27. Bxe3 Rxe3 {Let's see if I can survive the white's rooks penetration. } 28. Rxf6 Rxc3 29. Rd7+ {If Rd-d6, I could not have protected the b6's pawn. } Ka6 30. Rdd6 Rb8 31. Rfh6 {Right, but I have my revenge too. } Rc1+ 32. Kg2 Rc2+ 33. Kh3 Rxa2 34. Rxh7 Rb2 {This is almost a "study" position. } 35. Rg7 Rxb3 36. Rxg5 c4 {I'll go first...} 37. Rc6 c3 {Two moves are better than nothing. } 38. Rd5 {? overlooking...} Rh8+ 39. Kg4 Rxh2 40. Rd3 Rc2 { A rooks' cross. } 41. Kf4 Kb5 42. Rc8 Ka4 43. g4 Rb4+ 44. Kf3 Kb3 45. g5 Rb5 46. g6 Rf5+ 47. Ke4 {I'd say ?: Kg5 was better, IMO. } Rg5 48. Rc6 b5 49. Kd4 Rg4+ 50. Ke5 b4 {With all this manouvering, I have managed to connect my pawn so my other pieces are free. } 51. Kf6 Rcg2 52. Kf7 {Now, this is the interesting part: white cannot push further the pawn!} Kc2 53. Rd5 b3 {Unfortunateli, my opponent lost because of the timer... Are black winning, here?}
