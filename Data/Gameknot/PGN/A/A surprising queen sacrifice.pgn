[Opening "Polish (Sokolsky) opening (A00)"]

1. b4 {The Sokolsky, an opening I employ occasionally with rather good results; nobody seems to know how to play against it, and the mix of positional play and tactical tension suits me fine. It's also basically asymmetrical in nature, leading to dynamic, fluid positions with little chance of ending ending in a draw.} e5 2. Bb2 Bxb4 {The most common continuation, usually leading to sharp positions where White may have to play carefully. Longer-term he may find a positional bonus in the exchange, as he now has a surplus of center pawns, but his kingside is often a bit soft for a long while.} 3. Bxe5 Nf6 4. c4 {We're still deep in opening theory here, and White has several good options. 4.Nf3 is also good.} O-O 5. e3 d5 6. Nf3 {White is in no hurry to exhange in the center; if Black captures on c4 White will recapture and develop his bishop in one move. Also, White is now in a real hurry to get his king safely tucked away before Black can start operations for real.} Re8 7. a3 {A small, but very important move. White's bishop on e5 is on the verge of being forced off e5, and when that happens Black would like nothing better than to post his bishop on d6. With his dsb on d6, Black will be in position to exert potentially fatal levels of pressure against White's underdeveloped kingside. But by forcing the bishop to move now, White prevents this. Black will either have to move his bishop off-line to a5, or waste a tempo in tucking it away on f8; if it moves to d6 immediately, White will simply exchange it.} Ba5 8. Be2 {White cannot put off moving his bishop any longer. White considered capturing on d5 first, but rejected that line because the black knight on d5 (after recapture) would make development of his knight on b1 more difficult.} dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nc6 10. Bb2 {Retreating to b2 is preferable here, as the bishop preserves his influence on the long diagonal. On 10.Bg3 Black may consider exchanging his knight on f6 for it (after Nf6-h5xg3), which would immobilize White's kingside and weaken his center pawns.} Bg4 11. O-O Ne5 {The automatic move in this position would be Be2, moving the lsb out of danger and protecting the knight on f3. But... this would cost White the bishop pair and exchange a rather powerful, freeranging piece for a bishop of mediocre influence. Are there any alternatives? Turns out there is one...} 12. Nxe5 {!! White simply ignores the pin on the knight, sacrificing his queen for ... what, exactly? Turns out there are fascinating combinations against Black's king, queen, and rook based on the weakness of f7 and the relative placement of the pieces.} Bxd1 13. Nxf7 {This may look a little insane, but consider for a moment: where is the Black queen to go? There are only two squares where it won't be immediately lost once White moves his knight off f7 (with a discovered check): e7 and b8. Of these, b8 may actually be the best choice, but it's a real dreadful place for the queen to be.} Qe7 14. Ng5+ Kf8 {Or Black could try Kh8 with an implicit draw offer. White would reject that, of course, the whole point of this line being that White believes his pieces to be more powerful united than Black's more mobile but single queen.} 15. Ne6+ Kf7 16. Nxc7+ Kg6 17. Nxe8 {And White is at plus 1, with two passed, protected center pawns, a well-protected king vs. Black's out-in-the-open majesty, and the bishop pair.} Rxe8 18. Rxd1 Ng4 19. Be2 {Safer than trying to force the knight away by means of f3 or h3. For instance 19.h3 opens the door for Bxd2!? with dangerous complications. White is dangerously weak on e3, as shown by this line: 19.h3 Bxd2!? 20.hxg4 Bxe3 21.Bd4 Bxd4 22.Rxd4 Qe1+ 23.Kh2 Qxf2 24.Rd2 Qh4+ 25.Kg1 Re1+ 26.Bf1 Qf6 27.Rf2 Qxa1 -/+ White looks able to hold if he plays 20.Nxd2 instead, but why give Black such counterplay at all in the first place?} Ne5 20. Nc3 Qh4 {Aiming for play against White's kingside, while keeping an eye on the center. Both f2 and h2 are weak and Black aims to follow up by moving his knight back to g4, threatening them both at the same time. But now White is sufficiently developed to take advantage of his piece superiority and Black's exposed king.} 21. Nd5 Ng4 22. Nf4+ Kh6 {Winning a tempo, which gives White the option of doing a lightning-transfer of the knight to h3, from where it will shield all of his weaknesses.} 23. Nh3 Rf8 24. f3 Nf6 25. Be5 {The d-pawn is slated for advance, and White wants the bishop out in front of the pawn chain and on the kingside first, from where it will be able to operate more freely.} Nh5 {Potentially a grave mistake. White cannot take advantage of it now - his knight on h3 would hang - but maybe later... and if not, then Black will for sure have to spend extra time moving the knight out of danger again.} 26. d4 {Anchors the bishop on e5 and prepares to race off to the finishing line...} Qe7 {Ah! It happened! Black has now lost the knight on h5.} 27. g4 {The black knight on h5 has nowhere to retreat.} Qh4 {A desperate waste of time. With the pawn already on g4, White now can protect the knight on h3 without problems.} 28. Kg2 Qe7 29. Bd3 {The knight is doomed, but White's in no hurry to pick it off. The bishop move aims at restricting the freedom of Black's king even further - and also threatens mate or loss of queen by means of g5+.} Nf6 30. g5+ Kh5 31. gxf6 gxf6 {The threat against the bishop on e5 is illusory; again Black's exposed king allows White to speed-move the knight to the rescue.} 32. Nf4+ Kh6 33. Nd5 Qg7+ 34. Bg3 {And the bishop moves out of danger while shielding the king at the same time.} Rd8 35. Nf4 {Not 35.e4 on which Black can destroy White's pawns by means of 35...f5! 36.Nf4 fxe4 37.Bxe4 Bc3! 38.Rac1 Rxd4.} Re8 36. Kf2 {White's setup afforts Black little possibility of counterplay. The White king has now vacated the g-file and the rook is poised to take over there.} Qe7 37. Nd5 {Once again the knight springs into action, gluing White's position position together while forcing Black to respond.} Qe6 38. Rdg1 {But this time White ignores the threat against the knight. Black cannot touch it - it's toxic: 38...Qxd5 39.Bf4+ Kh5 40.Rg7! and Black is lost. 40...Rh8 41.Rc1 Bb6 42.Rc8! Qa2+ 43.Kg3 and mates.} Kg7 {The only move.} 39. Be5+ {The discovered check means the pawn on f6 is lost as well.} Kf7 40. Nxf6 Rc8 41. Nxh7 {This is not mere greed; the knight needs to vacate f6 in order to let the bishop control g7.} Qb3 42. Rg7+ Ke8 {And Black resigns in the face of 43.Bg6+ Kd8 44.Bf6++. Nor would 42...Ke6 be any better: 43.Ng5+ Kd5 44.Rd7+ Kc6 45.Rd6+ Kc7 46.Ne6+ Kb8 47.Rd8+ Bc7 48.Bxc7+ Ka8 49.Rxc8++}
