1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {The typical first two moves for me. As I play more games, the Ruy Lopez is becoming a bit less common than before.} 3. Bc4 {Pretty good control of the centre for white.} d6 {Is this OK? I don't play Nf6 right away in case White does Ng5.} 4. h3 {I understand that white was trying to prevent Bg4, but this seems like a bit of a wasted move.} Nf6 {I decided that I should just develop my knight, even if it does allow Ng5.} 5. Ng5 {As expected.} Be6 {I didn't want to block any of my bishops with my queen to defend f7, but 6. Bxe6 fxe6 seems like it weakens my kingside a bit.} 6. Bb5 {Threatening to double my pawns.} a6 {I decide to threaten the bishop, because Bxc6 opens up the b-file for my rook.} 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 {I now have an open file and good control of the centre.} 8. O-O Qd7 {I line up for a bishop sacrifice on h3, but the knight of g5 must move first to ensure success.} 9. c3 {Why this move?} h6 {I apply the pressure onto the g5 knight so I can strike at h3.} 10. d4 {?? I don't know why this move was done. It just seems to give away a knight.} hxg5 11. f3 {With rook, bishop and queen all pointed at h3, as well as this weakening move, a successful sacrifice may be easier than I thought!} Bxh3 {My sacrifice begins.} 12. gxh3 Qxh3 {I think I have successfully weakened white's kingside.} 13. Kf2 {Avoiding Qg3#.} Qh2+ {Chasing the king.} 14. Ke1 {White's king is now on its original square, with no living pieces effectively developed.} exd4 {I decide to take the pawn.} 15. cxd4 Rb8 {Exploiting the open b-file.} 16. b3 d5 {Asking for an exchange.} 17. e5 Nh5 {I'm trying to bring my knight closer to the action.} 18. Bxg5 {Taking the pawn.} Nf4 {Forcing the exchange.} 19. Bxf4 Qxf4 20. Nc3 Bb4 {Pinning the knight.} 21. Qd3 Bxc3+ {I decide to take anyway.} 22. Qxc3 Rb6 {Defending c6.} 23. Rd1 Rh2 {Cutting off all of the king's escape squares.} 24. a4 {?? I guess white thought that I was trying to get his a-pawn. However, this allows a mate in two.} Qg3+ {Check.} 25. Rf2 {The only legal move.} Qxf2# {Checkmate! Feel free to comment and give lots of constructive criticism, for this was my 100th game and I wish for the next 100 to be better than the first!}
