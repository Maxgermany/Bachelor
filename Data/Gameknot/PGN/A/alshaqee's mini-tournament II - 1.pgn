1. d4 f5 2. Bg5 Nf6 3. Bxf6 exf6 4. e3 d5 5. Bd3 Bd6 6. Nc3 c6 7. Nge2 O-O 8. h4 b5 9. a3 Re8 10. Qd2 a5 {a lot of jockeying is going on with an eye to an attack upon the white king as it is undecided as to where he will live.} 11. h5 Na6 12. h6 g6 13. g3 b4 14. axb4 Bxb4 15. Kf1 Bb7 {this is played with an eye to setting up operations on the longest diagonal.} 16. Nf4 Bd6 17. Nce2 c5 18. c3 Nc7 19. Kg2 Bc6 20. Rh2 a4 21. Rah1 Kf7 {the threat on a sac on g6 followed by h7 must be respected.} 22. dxc5 {I'm inclined to believe that white overlooked the discovered check.  Now things become very complicated.} Bxf4 23. Nxf4 g5 24. Nh5 d4+ 25. f3 dxe3 {this leads to an ending where black has an advantage.} 26. Bc4+ Bd5 27. Qd3 Bxc4 28. Qxc4+ Qd5 29. Qxd5+ Nxd5 30. Ng7 {this is probably the best considering that the horse can not get into play otherwise and black is playing with an extra horse in effect.} Re5 31. Re1 Rb8 32. Kh3 Kg6 {threatening ... Kxh6 followed by ... Kxg7} 33. c6 {an unexpected reply.  I had expected 33 g4 to which I would replied 33 ... fxg4+ 34 fxg4 Nf4+ 35 Kg3 e2 with multiple threats i.e. Re3+, Rxb2, Nd3} Kxh6 34. Nxf5+ {this desperado capture is white's best chance.} Rxf5 35. Kg4+ Kg6 36. Rxh7 {unexpected and best.  I had analyzed 36 Rh6+ and after 36 ... Kxh6 37 Kxf5 had eventually figured out that 37 ... Re8!! was the winning move.  It would have been essential to prevent Ke6 and Kxf6 setting up a mating net for white!} Rf4+ {carefully analyzed and calculated as leading to a win for black.} 37. gxf4 f5+ 38. Kg3 {After 38 Kh3 Nxf4+ 39 Kh2 Kxh7 leads to victory.} gxf4+ 39. Kg2 Rxb2+ 40. Kh1 {Actually 40 Kf1 holds the most chances and black must play accurately for the win: 40 ... Rf2+ 41 Kg1 Rxh7.  The best white can hope for is to win black's "a" pawn, but in the meantime white's "c" pawns will fall if not his "f" pawn.  } Kxh7 {the win is no problem.  black is ready to advance his "a" pawn and follow up with an ... e2 as needed to force a pawn promotion.  white is helpless to prevent this.}
