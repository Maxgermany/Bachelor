[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {The beginnings of Reti.} e5 {I gave him an easy pawn.  A truly dumb mistake on my part.  While it opens up the board, it's not what I wanted to do.} 2. Nxe5 {At this point, Dad said, "Thanks!"} d6 {Down a pawn, my tack is going to be conservative.  Might as well pressure his knight and open up the board.  I could have pressured with the queen, but didn't want to block up the avenues for developing other pieces.  I certainly didn't want to offer a trade by moving Nc6.} 3. Nf3 {According to the book ... 1. Nf3 e5 2. Nxe5 d6 3. Nf3 A04: Reti opening} Bg4 {A bit aggressive all things considered, but it does present some options down the road.} 4. c4 {Dad's been playing the c-pawn early a lot lately.  I seem to see this a lot lately, and I've started doing so myself as white.} Nd7 {I'm not sure why I'm not developing my king side at this point.  I suppose I'm trying to build support for an eventual pawn move to c5.} 5. d4 {Dad has a strong center pawn structure now.} Qf6 {This seems like a mistake as it blocks the kingside development even further.} 6. Nc3 {Dad strengthens the middle more.} Bxf3 {This move was not necessary.  It only speeds up the game.  With a pawn down, this probably wasn't wise.  The only advantage it confers is a stacked pawn structure.} 7. exf3 {I'm not sure I would have exposed the King here, but he did.} Qe6+ {Simple harassment without meaningful development.} 8. Be3 {A simple block that also develops the queenside.} Ne7 {I'm looking ahead to the possibility of Nf5 thus pressuring the bishop blocking the queen check.} 9. Nb5 {Massive knight fork possibility at Nxc7 .} Kd8 {Argh, pesky knights.  Obviously, a6 leads to a fork.  O-O-O loses a pawn.  Rc8 loses a pawn.  I think Kd8 is the only move that I have here. Thoughts?  By moving the king, I've given up the ability to castle either way.} 10. Qb3 {With the king out of position, it makes sense to pressure that side of the board.} c6 {A simple defensive move.} 11. Nxd6 {An interesting sacrifice.  I later commented to Dad that this wasn't necessary, but Dad says he saw a possible forced draw.  With a pawn advantage, I think he's being quite charitable.  In any event, this leads to an even situation.} Qxd6 {At this point, my center is destroyed, my king is out of position, and my development is a bit behind that of white.} 12. Qxb7 {Back to even.  Wouldn't Nb6 have been better?} Qb8 {But, I choose a more aggressive defense and offer the queen trade.} 13. Qxb8+ {Dad accepts the queen trade.  At this point, a draw seems likely.} Rxb8 {With the queen trade, I gain control of the b file.} 14. b3 {I might have preferred Ra-b1, but this works, too.} Nf5 {Looking for a knight-bishop trade at this stage in the game.} 15. Bd3 {Final developing move for white.  All mid-level pieces are out, and white still has the option to castle.} Bb4+ {I check here to at least temporarily delay white's castle.  I expected the following: 16.	Ke2 	Bc3 17.	Ra-c1 	Nxd4  18.	Kd1 	Bb2 19.	Rb1 	Bc3} 16. Kd1 {This seems to beg for Nxe3  fxe3.} Bc3 {I expected this combination: 17.	Rc1 	Nxe3  18.	fxe3 	Bb4 ... and white followed suit.} 17. Rc1 {Go away!} Nxe3+ {Check!} 18. fxe3 {Whatever!  Go away!} Bb4 {OK, I'll go away (for now).} 19. Rc2 {With black having a black square bishop, this move is smart as it effectively diminishes the strength of that piece.} g6 {Countering the bishop's line to permit Rh8 to move.} 20. c5 {This gets scary for black as the bishop may get trapped.} Ba5 {But, I think I'm overly worried here.  The bishop is not yet at risk for trap.  In any event, I back off.} 21. Ke2 {White is slowly advancing his pieces making the board smaller for black.} Re8 {Controlling the open file.} 22. Kf2 {Avoiding possible problems with Re8.} Kc7 {I'm also trying to shorten the board for white, but I have less pawns to provide cover.} 23. Rb1 {Although both of my rooks are controlling the open files, this is still smart as sets up the possibility of advancing the b pawn.} Kd8 {I see problems down the road for this side of the board, and I think my logic was to get the King over in support of the f, g and h pawns.} 24. a3 {A nice little pawn wall.} Bc7 {Time to get out of Dodge and start working on a f, g, h pawn attack.} 25. g3 {White further shortens the board.} h5 {Space is becoming important on the board, and I want to prevent g4.} 26. Be4 {Nice pressure on the unprotected c pawn.} Re6 {My only real option.} 27. Rd2 {This shift creates the possibility of a d pawn attack and aligns the rook with the black king.} f5 {Go away!  Hide!} 28. d5 {I probably didn't see this coming.  Nice move by white.  } cxd5 {I expected the following: 29.	Bxd5 	Re7 30.	c6 	Nf8 31.	Bc4  	Ke8} 29. Bxd5 {Back to even.} Re7 {I'm trying to retain control of the e file without giving up too much space.} 30. Bc6 {Excellent move.  I probably didn't see this coming either.  The knight is trapped by the rook.  This was all set up in move 27.  I'm not at risk of losing a piece yet, but pressure is definitely mounting.} a5 {This move is an attempt to set up a counter-attack, i.e. a4.  At this point, white cannot capture bxa4 without losing a rook.} 31. b4 {A safe defending move.} axb4 {Accelerating the game.} 32. axb4 {Trade accepted.  White's better off for the trade as the pawn is still supported by a rook.} Ke8 {Still trying to get the king to support the f, g and h pawns.} 33. Ra2 {This sets up potential pressure on the 7th rank but permits the king to escape.} Kf7 {I stick with my plan.} 34. Bxd7 {Accelerating the game further.  I generally don't mind trading a knight for a bishop late in the game.} Rxd7 {Back to even with control of the d file.} 35. Ke2 {Recognizing and counteracting the down-the-road Rd2 threat.} Be5 {Sets up a possible attack on the b pawn.} 36. Rb3 {Prevents the bishop attack.} Rdb7 {Stacked rooks are fun.} 37. Ra4 {Power against power, the definition of a draw.} Rb7b5 {I'm hoping to stop the pawn advancement.  I've also created the possibility of Rxc5 bxc5 Rxb3 trade.} 38. f4 {Go away!} Bc7 {Sets up the possibility of Ba5 bxa5 Rxb3 or other variations on this theme.} 39. c6 {Seems premature to me.} Rb8b6 {Now, white must defend and risks losing a pawn.} 40. Rc3 {White's only option to keep the advanced pawn.} Ke7 {Why didn't I take the b pawn?  We'll never know.  I guess I was eying the c pawn.} 41. Ra2 {White relinquishes the b pawn completely.} Rb5xb4 {I accept the gift.} 42. Rd2 {White blocks the king in support and controls the d file.} Rb4b2 {A pawn up, I seek to press for a draw.} 43. Rcc2 {Black doesn't force the trade, but still offers it.} Rxc2 {I press for the draw.} 44. Rxc2 {At this point, black is up by one pawn again.} Kd6 {Black looks to go up 2 pawns.} 45. Kf3 {There's nothing to be done for the c pawn, so white consolidates his one pawn advantage.} Rxc6 {Up 2 and offering a rook trade.} 46. Rxc6+ {White accepts the trade.} Kxc6 {Black is up 2 but down a pawn.} 47. e4 {There's not much to say from here on out.  The game has some win possibilities for white, but I was fairly set on just not losing and avoiding any horrible mistakes.  When white offers a piece ...} fxe4+ {I take it.} 48. Kxe4 { 2 to black but quickly losing pawns.  Lots of draw options here.} Bd8 {Some help for the pawns.} 49. Ke5 {If white can separate the king from the pawns, a win is possible.} Kd7 {Perhaps a little later than would normally be comfortable, I staring moving my king back over in support.} 50. h3 {The king can't move anywhere useful, so a safe move.} Ke7 {My only shot is to separate his king from the pawns.} 51. f5 {If I take at this point, I could lose as it would definitely separate the h pawn from its support.} Kf7 {So, I move the king closer.} 52. fxg6+ {Acceleration.} Kxg6 {Back to  2, now in support of the h pawn.} 53. Kf4 {Supporting move.} Bg5+ {h4 might have been more interesting as it would have trapped white's last h pawn.} 54. Kf3 {White's only real move.} h4 {I needed to do this earlier.} 55. gxh4 {Trade.} Bxh4 { 2, but I've not separated the king from his last pawn.} 56. Kg4 {White's best move, since it keeps the bishop at bay.} Bg5 {Bd8 might have been better.  In any event, I offer the draw here and white accepts.  Good game Pop!}
