[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03)"]

1. e4 {This is a mini tournament game against a player about 200 pnts above myself,  Please feel free to make any constructive comments on improvements that could be made.  e4 , my most common opening.} Nf6 {Alekhine's defence } 2. e5 {I decide to push my pawn to attack his knight rather than defend the pawn.} Nd5 3. d4 {d4, opening up my queens bishop and protecting the advanced pawn.} e6 {I like this position, my e5 is already cramping the fox's style and I have a open game.} 4. c4 {normally I would go Nf3 here but I decided to keep that black horse on the run and try to get more control of the centre.} Nb6 5. Nc3 {time to start giving my brave pawns some support.} Bb4 {I thought the fox would reply with that move but it does leave g2 very weak. Both his kingside knight and bishop have abandoned there sides. I need to exploit this.} 6. Qg4 {So I decide to attack g7 knowing if he castle's then I can bring my bishop to h6.} h6 {maybe Bf3 might have been better, I know its a backward'sstep in development but it protects the pawn.  Or g6 maybe.} 7. Qxg7 {Qxg7, 1 up.  } Rf8 {naturally protecting his rook.} 8. Bxh6 {Bxh6 threatening Qxf8#!} Qe7 {Only one possible move for black to stop checkmate.} 9. Nf3 {I pondered for a while. I was 2 up and queen and bishop in a good place . I did contemplate exchanging queens here( 9.Qf6, Qxf6.10. exf6) He could of course wait until I exchanged and simply moved Rg8 so I decided against that.  I wanted more support out and my king tucked away too so I moved Nf3.} Nc6 {Black starts to develop now there is a sort of impasse on the king side.} 10. Bd3 {It was still bugging me if I should move Qf6?  Instead decide on bringing my other bishop into play.} d5 {I thought this was a good move. , attacking c4 but at the same time opening d7 for his knight to move into to protect his rook and cover f3.} 11. exd6 e.p. {Was this a mistake?  That was a good pawn on e5.} cxd6 12. O-O {castling, freeing up my knight on c3. } Bxc3 {Black takes action now that the knight is not pinned.  He decides to exchange and in the process double my pawns up.} 13. bxc3 Nd7 {Black makes that protecting move. His King does look cramped.} 14. Bg5 { Bg5??  should I have gone d5? attacking his knight and pawn. Ready for one of my rooks to slide to e1 attacking his queen. } f6 {I have to exchange now. I did think of moving Bg3+} 15. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {The fox now has a good wall of pawns in front of his king, I'm still 2 up but i've lost alot of my advantage.} 16. Bh4 b6 17. Rfe1 {Here I was pinning 2 of his pawns, e6 and f6. Could I exploit this? } Bb7 {Black unites his rooks and brings his bishop on the long diagonal. Things are starting to look better for black.} 18. d5 {Or was Bf5 better?} Nce5 19. Nxe5 {exchange} Nxe5 20. Rad1 {I needed to bring my other rook into the game. To protect my bishop and pawn.} Rac8 21. dxe6 {my worry here was that I was opening the h1-a8 line for his bishop and with the g and h file wide open the fox could mount  a serious attack. Still I decided to break into his wall of pawns. In the process if he went Kxe6 his knight would be pinned.} Kxe6 {The fox makes that move. } 22. f4 {So I attack his knight.} Rfh8 {and he in  turn attacks my bishop.} 23. Bg3 Ba6 24. fxe5 fxe5 {Slowly but surely the kings defenses are vanishing.} 25. Re4 {c4 was in danger ! so I protected it with my rook. In preparation for doubling them on the e file.} Rcg8 {Black swithes his play to the open files.} 26. a4 {I wanted to advance c4 to attack d6 to take e5 protection away but first I needed b6 out of the way .} Bb7 {Black attacks my rook but also a worry to me was g2. Bishop and a potetial rook attack.  } 27. Re2 {I had to withdraw and protect g2 at the same time. } Bc6 {Attacking my a pawn  and tring to create a passed pawn} 28. a5 {I continue with my plan.} bxa5 {He now has a fox on the run but I can now look at his kings defenses.} 29. c5 Rxg3 {Black decides to take the presure off of e5 by sacrificing his rook . } 30. hxg3 {However all my pawns are now doubled now and black has took the sting out of my attack. Still 5 up.} d5 31. Rde1 {doubled my rooks at last} e4 {pawn storm. } 32. Bb1 Ke5 {Black gets ever closer} 33. Rf2 {I need to try to get around the back some how. I needed to be careful which rook I moved. Move Rf1 and his bishop was lurking ...Bb5 winning one of my rooks.} a4 {There goes that fox. } 34. g4 {Looking to check him on f5.} Bd7 {Black defends f5 and attacks g4. By moving the bishop there though he does take a defender awy from d5.} 35. c4 {So I decide against advancing g4 and opt for c4 instead attacking d5. I know I will be a pawn down in the exchange but I want that king out from behind those pesky pawns.} Bxg4 36. cxd5 Kxd5 37. Bxe4+ {Black king is now in the open. My dilema here was do I take e4 with my rook or bishop, I went with the latter. A wrong choice I feel now. 37. Rxe4 would have been better attacking both a4 and g4. } Kxc5 {He was 3 pawns to 2 up in that exchange. It should have been better for me.} 38. Rb1 {still 4 up. So not too bad.  I did not want that fox been aided by his king so blocked that route off.} a3 {The fox still runs. } 39. Ra2 {That fox is now keeping busy 2 rooks. Not good for me.} Re8 {Black makes his move while my rooks are stuck.} 40. Rxa3 {A risk.  I would not have done this if I was not 4 up but my thoughts were, better having 2 mobile rooks and no foxes to worry about in exchange for my bishop. Was this a right play?} Rxe4 41. Rxa7 {My advantage is dwindling a little. } Kc6 42. Rg7 {Im thinking long and hard if I should exchange my rook for his bishop. Maybe not a good exchange.} Kc5 43. Rc1+ Kd6 44. Rg6+ Kd5 45. Ra1 Ke5 46. Rf1 {Stopping blacks king or bishop attacking my rook and keeping his king away from mine.} Kd4 47. Rgf6 {Uniting my rooks.} Ke5 48. g3 {Gives my king some breathing space.} Bh3 49. Rf1f2 Re1+ {now i'm under attack.} 50. Kh2 {My only move. An exchange would have meant a draw.} Be6 {Black retreats.} 51. Rf6f8 {My idea here is to try and pin his bishop with Re8.} Ra1 52. Re8 Ra6 {Blacksaw the attack. I was planning Re2 next and he would have lost his bishop but now he has it protected.} 53. g4 {So I decide to advance my pawn knowing that my Rook on the f file stops the king attacking it.} Kd6 54. g5 {I have to move the pawn as he has unpinned his bishop.} Kd7 55. Ref8 {I reunite my rooks. Boy this is tough and taking some time to work out.  Cat and mouse at the moment.} Ra4 {Black now attacks my pawn} 56. Rf8f4 {I block the potential black rook move of Rg4 or Rh4+ and offer my rook up for exchange.  } Ra3 {Of course black does not want the exchange and trys another way through threatening Rh3+} 57. Rf2f3 {I block that.} Ra2+ 58. Kg3 Ra1 59. Rf3f1 {Blocking the attack again.} Ra3+ {Now I need to be careful!!!  Kh4 would result in disaster!  Kh4?? Rh3#!  My own pawn blocking the kings escape.} 60. Kh2 Ra2+ 61. Rf1f2 {and the blocking continues.} Ra3 62. g6 {I decide to advance my pawn ahead of blocking again.} Rh3+ 63. Kg2 Rh6 64. Rf4f6 {protecting the pawn } Bd5+ 65. Kg3 {again moving King to g1 would have resulted in a lost game. } Rh1 {Black looks to put his rook on g1 attacking King and pawn.} 66. Rf6f7+ {I thought about this one for a while. I may loose a rook but I would queen my pawn if he took it.  Plus If he did not go for it I would have my rook on the 7th rank.} Ke8 {I thought this was a poor move .  His king is now trapped on the back rank.} 67. Rh7 {If he exchanges , I Queen.  I spot a checkmate at last. Moving my f Rook to  to b2.  Will the fox see it.} Rg1+ {No.} 68. Kh4 {I moved in here  rather than to the middle of the board to stop being chased about.} Rxg6 {The pawn falls but...} 69. Rb2 {The end is nigh. } Bg8 {Maybe R d6 would have prolonged it.} 70. Rb8# {The end at last.  I nearly blew it a couple of times. Up to date my biggest scalp. A very nice game to play.}
