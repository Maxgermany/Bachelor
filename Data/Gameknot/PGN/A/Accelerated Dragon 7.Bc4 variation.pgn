1. e4 c5 {A recent trend for me: I have played Maroczy bind positions against 1. c4 for a while but have never really played 1...c5. I like Maroczy bind positions but don't really know any theory although I seem to have a good feel for the positions so I'm not sure it matters.} 2. Nf3 g6 {Designed to avoid the Rossolimo variation of which I know nothing.} 3. d4 {3. c3!? was also possible giving rise to an alapin position-type.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Qxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 is the critical line according to Casten and Heine Neilson's book on the Accelerated Dragon.} Bg7 5. Nc3 {5.c4 is of course, the Maroczy Bind. The move played is more combative.} Nc6 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bc4 {7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O d5! 9. ed Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Qxd5! is an interesting pawn sacrifice.} O-O {7...Qa5 is the other main move which is not nearly as passive as some sources claim.} 8. Bb3 {8.f3? Qb6! is a trap Fischer once fell into. 8...d5!? is also worth a look.} a5 {Aiming to swap the a-pawn for the e-pawn. The threat of ...a5-a4-a3 with pressure on the queenside dark squares is a major strategic theme in this line, as is dark-square counterplay in all variations of the accelerated dragon. 8...d6 9. f3 Bd7 and now 10.h4!? (10. Qd2 is a full-blown Dragon) is a sharp alternative to the Dragon main lines.} 9. f3 {9.a4 Ng4 is a drawish variation. 9.O-O!? a4 10. Nxa4 Nxe4 is murky and is what I'd least like to face as Black.} d5 {The only consistent move - Black generally aims to get this in without the need for a preliminary ...d7-d6.} 10. Bxd5 {10. exd5 Nb4 11. Nde2 a4 12. Nxa4 Bf5 or 12...e6 are supposed to be fine for Black, but things are sharper than at first glance. Interesting is how many unfashionable lines there are with possibilities here.} Nxd5 11. exd5 Nb4 {Simultaneously aiming at c2 and d5.} 12. Nde2 Bf5 {Training another piece on c2.} 13. Rc1 b5 {Black gets his queen-side counterplay going.} 14. a3 {!? Generally considered a safe line, but it can get very interesting. 14 O-O is the sharpest line although I think 14...Nxc2 is fine with similar play to the other lines.} Nxc2+ 15. Rxc2 Bxc2 16. Qxc2 b4 {Noteworthy is how fast the queen-side pawns have moved down the board and how potentially threatening the dark-squared bishop on g7 is in tandem with them. If black gets time to activate his rooks, white will be in trouble.} 17. Nb5 {? This has a nasty flaw as is subsequently demonstrated 17. Na4 Qxd5 18. Nb6 Qe6 and now 19. Kf2 (19. Nxa8 Qxe3 20. Nc7 and either 20...Bd4!? or 20...Rc8 give Black ample compensation) 19...Rab8 is a balanced endgame where both sides must be very careful.} Qxd5 18. Nc7 {?? This just leads to a lost game } Rfc8 {! After the ensuing exchanges, black winds up in a dominating position.} 19. Nxd5 Rxc2 20. axb4 axb4 21. Kf2 Rxb2 {Black now has a huge positional plus whereas white's pieces are poorly co-ordinated.} 22. Nxe7+ {It's hard to see what else.} Kf8 23. Nd5 Raa2 {The b4 passed pawn and connected rooks on the 7th rank along with the bishop controlling the a1-h8 diagonal mean black is winning despite the notional material balance. Black's dark-square domination is a theme of many successful accelerated dragon games.} 24. Re1 b3 {Priming a trap} 25. Bc1 Rbc2 26. Nb4 Rc4 27. Nxa2 {? This shorten's white's resistance. 27. Nd3 was essential. White cannot stop the a-pawn.} bxa2 28. Ba3+ Kg8 29. Nc1 Bd4+ {Stopping any back-rank threats in their tracks.} 30. Kg3 a1=Q 31. Re8+ {This is just a spite check which goes nowhere.} Kg7 32. Bf8+ Kf6 {White is well and truly busted.}
