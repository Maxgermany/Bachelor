1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I feel honoured!  A Master who I had never played or before with a rating of 2345, sent me a challenge!  Despite the fact that I had all the extra games I accepted the challenge with some gusto.  Maybe, after being Freddied quite often you could say that I was a glutton for punishment though!  He gave me the Lopez, I was considering playing the Open Lopez but after the debacle with Dave I really wanted to redeem myself somehow.  The first 7 moves follow Autopilot Part 1, but on the 7th move I played the Main Line d6.  I still stuck to that bally DB like the proverbial limpet though!} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 {8. c3 - I decided to pick up the action here.  This move is played to allow an escape square for his lsb should I decide to play Na5 and not wish to allow it to be exchanged on b3.} O-O 9. h3 Na5 10. Bc2 {10. Bc2 - see my previous note.} c5 11. d4 Qc7 {11. ...... Qc7 - still in book.  Glenda is in her element here - she supports the e4 pawn X-ray style.} 12. Nbd2 cxd4 13. cxd4 {13. cxd4 - pawn trade.} Nc6 14. Nb3 {14. Nb3 - freeing up the c1 - h6 diagonal for his dsb.} a5 15. Be3 a4 16. Nbd2 {16. Nbd2 - forced, but that knight can always spring onto a good square later on.} Bd7 17. Rc1 Qb7 {17. ..... Qb7 - still in book.  Glenda is to support a rook move from f8 to c8.} 18. Qe2 Rfc8 19. a3 exd4 20. Nxd4 {20. Nxd4 - pawn trade.} b4 {20. ...... b4 - down to the last few moves in the database.  This move is favourable to white but I am stumped for any better alternatives.} 21. Bd3 d5 22. exd5 Nxd4 23. Rxc8+ Qxc8 {23. ..... Qxc8?? - in a post match pm, Jeff pointed out that this was the losing move.  It looks as though Bxc8 was the pick of the bunch here as Rxc8 drops the exchange to Ba6!} 24. Bxd4 Bd8 {24. ...... Bd8 - Fou Lenoir cannot stay on that square because of the ominous pile up of the Wicked Witch of the West and her castle on the e column.} 25. Ne4 Nxe4 26. Qxe4 {26. Qxe4 - knight trade.} f5 {26. ...... f5 - suddenly I feel cold and the air becomes putrid and there is a dark, dark shadow over me.  It is also right over Henry and is threatening to descend on h7.  What is this?  Well, you readers have guessed it by now - it is the chessic Grim Reaper - Old Matey!} 27. Qf4 {27. Qf4 - nasty, nasty.} Ba5 28. Re7 {28. Re7 - here I resign the game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  I am already a pawn down and the pawn on g2 must now drop and I have a terrible feeling that Old Matey cannot be too far away (although Jeff did not announce it).  So I waved the white flag.  Another disappointing show from The Beginner with the Class A Rating.}
