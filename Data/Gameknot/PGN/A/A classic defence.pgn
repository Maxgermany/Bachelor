1. c4 Nf6 {If my opponent plays d4, I can still play e5 and fall into my known lines. } 2. Nc3 {He doesn't. He plays a classical English, I almost never face. So I can't decide easily among the several possibilities. e5 seems natural, but it leads far away from my known paths. } e5 3. e4 c6 {This was made with the intention to challenge the center as soon as possible, and stop any N jump ideas. I know that I will suffer for e5. } 4. Nf3 d6 {I have to delay the d5 break due to my bad idea. Still, I can play patiently and "just develop". It may be good, sometimes. } 5. g3 {Well, this means that I can delay my d5 break plan... forever. It opens g4 for a pin, but I sensed it was whorthless, now, since I am not planning to occupy d4 right now. I can't prevent d4 (otherwise, I should have played c5). } Nbd7 {This N will go though f8 to g6 or something like this. } 6. Bg2 Be7 {I hate to castle kingside, but in this position it is the best I can do, foreseeing an f5 break sooner or later. } 7. d3 {My opponent is... very classic, too. IMO, d4 was much better. } O-O 8. Be3 Re8 {This is to make f8 free for my N. But it was a mistake, since my plan was f5, with my R behind. It is Nf6 who has to go to h7 after h7 is played. } 9. Qd2 {Still building... nothing. Now, I have to be careful: moves like h6, now, would inspire dangerous sacrifices.} Nf8 10. h3 Kh8 {Making room for Ng8, and f5. A weird way to proceed, but my opponent is not taking advantage of my passive game. } 11. Ng5 {Threatening f7! The only way to come out of this fork without admitting I simply overlooked it is...} Be6 {I'll lose my nice lsb. Ok. That's all. In return, I will control forever the center (with a pawn in e6). } 12. Nxe6 {Still, I thougt it was wiser to use my N for it!} Nxe6 13. f4 {Now: I'm squeezed, which means I have to play with great care. If I exchange, I'll give him the B's pair power. But any attack discovers weak points. I found white's.} Nh5 {If he plays g4, exf4 will be good for me. The correct way to defend would be Ne2. I can exchange and accept the opening of the g column for him.} 14. f5 {White tempts me into Ng5, and avoids the loss of a pawn on f4. } Nd4 15. Qf2 {...and white thinks he has parried all threats and threats d4. But here, I had a Caissan inspiration...} Nxg3 {! Allow me the self-indulging comment. If QxN, Bh4 forks his royal couple. } 16. Rg1 Bh4 {Has white a way out? I thought castling was ok, but Nxe4 is looming anyway. } 17. Kd2 {? After o-o-o, Nxe4, white had Qf1, and my edge is not so big. Now, I win his Q. Ok. This is not a "gimmy" as you may think. } Nxe4+ 18. Nxe4 Bxf2 19. Bxf2 Qa5+ 20. Nc3 Qb4 21. b3 Nxf5 {I can force the game with Qa3, but Rb2 would stop me. So I gave him the initiative. This proved to be very harder to win that appears for the material advantage. } 22. Be4 g6 {I accepted to scramble my pawns, but I overlooked the resource I would have used, if white. } 23. Bxf5 gxf5 24. Bh4 {Threatening mate!} Re6 25. Raf1 f4 26. Kc2 Rg8 {After the exchanges, I'm done. Almost. } 27. Ne4 {He still threats many things, and my Q is virtually out of the game!} Rxg1 28. Rxg1 Rg6 29. Bf6+ Kg8 30. Bg5 {Now he threats h4-h5. He is threatening Nf6+, too. I just have to stay calm, don't lose my cool blood, and defend. } Kf8 31. Nf6 Qa5 {Qb6 (threatening R) could be an alternative, but this forces a4 at some point.} 32. Nxh7+ Kg7 {...and now, white must lose material!} 33. Nf6 Rxf6 34. Bxf6+ Kxf6 {Wonderful! Now it IS a gimme!} 35. a4 Qc5 36. Rg2 Qe3 37. h4 Qh3 {The last "finesse". White can't defend his last chance. } 38. Rg8 Qxh4 39. Rb8 Qf2+ 40. Kc3 Qd4+ 41. Kd2 e4 {}
