1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. e3 {Drat! says Ion} d6 {3. ........ d6 - Ion bolsters his c pawn.} 4. Nc3 g6 {4. ....... g6 - Ion is preparing to fianchetto his king bishop to g7 which will facilitate castling and strike at the squares on the a1 to h8 diagonal.} 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. dxc5 Qa5 {? - Ion annotated this as a bad move, not sure except that white's next move forces a queen trade which perhaps, Ion you did not want.  The purpose of Qa5 was, I think, to pile up on the white c5 pawn hoping to win it next move.} 7. Qa4+ Qxa4 8. Nxa4 Bd7 9. Nc3 {9. Nc3 - white must retreat this knight, it is hanging on a4 and en prise to the black bishop on d7.  Note that black now has a slight lead in development but with the queens off, how much of an issue is that remains to be seen.} dxc5 {9. ......... dxc5 - Ion regains his pawn.} 10. Be2 Nc6 11. a3 {11. a3 - prophylactic move to prevent a black knight from landing on b4.} O-O 12. Rb1 {?} Bf5 {12. ......... Bf5.  Ion stated here that "After a very rocky opening, Black is getting on top".} 13. Ra1 Ne4 {13. ........ Ne4 - over the last few moves black managed to complete his development and castle.  White is still lagging behind with his dsb still on its home square and white is not castled.  White needs to develop that bishop asap - maybe white castling long is not a bad idea as the queens are off the board.} 14. Nxe4 Bxe4 15. O-O Na5 16. Ra2 {?  - defends b pawn but is a bit cut off.} Bb1 {Ion stated here that "White is in a terrible bind on the Q-side. What can he do?"} 17. Ra1 {17. Ra1 (what else?)} Bc2 18. Bd2 {18. Bd2 - white connects his rooks at last but Oh Dear! His b pawn is hanging!!} Nb3 {18. ......... Nb3 - I think you could have safely taken the b pawn here with your dsb.  White will not be able to get a skewie by putting a rook on b1 because your lsb is controlling that square!} 19. Ra2 {19. Ra2 - rook defends the b2 pawn but the rook is now out of play - see my previous note.} Rad8 20. Bc3 Bxc3 21. bxc3 {21. bxc3 - white's queenside pawns are a mess!  Not only that, black has a rook that controls the whole d file.  White cannot contest the d file because the d2 square is controlled by the black dsb.  The dsb must move, however, because it is en prise to the white rook on a2.  So black plays Bd3 which is a strong move because if the lsbs are exchanged then the d8 rook can come to d3 where it will be a cat among pigeons as I explain in a later note.} Bd3 22. Ne5 Bxe2 23. Rxe2 {25. Rxe2 - Ion stated here "Why all these exchanges, when Black had such an iron grip on the position? Well, at some point you have to squeeze until the enemy position falls to pieces. White's Q-side is shattered: the tree has been shaken; now it is time to gather the berries."} f6 24. Nf3 Na5 25. Rb2 b6 26. Nd2 Rd3 {26. Rd3 - this rook move puts the Cat Among The Pigeons, the cat being the black rook and the pigeons being the very vulnerable c pawns which are due to drop off very soon.} 27. Rc2 Rfd8 {27. ............ Rfd8 - Ion stated here that "Those weak pawns survive yet, but I'm not prepared to give White anything, not a thing. Now comes the collapse."} 28. Nf3 Nxc4 {28. ............ Nxc4 - the white knight has been decoyed away from the protection of the most advanced c pawn.  Now it duly drops off.} 29. a4 Nd2 30. Ne1 {30. Ne1? Ion stated here that "A blunder that loses the exchange: I don't have to take the rook at once. But even after the exchange of knights, White will lose another Q-side pawn after which the ending is easy for Black".} Rd3d6 31. Ra2 Nxf1 {31. ........... Nxf1 - bang goes the exchange for white!} 32. Kxf1 a6 {32. ............. a6?  Ion stated here "A slight slip: 32...Rd1 was the right move".  I agree, Ion, his knight would have been pinned making you effectively a rook up!} 33. g3 {33. g3 - creating a luft for his king in anticipation of that pin.} Rd6d1 34. Ra3 c4 {34. .......... c4 - this move prevents Rb3 which would be an attempt at counterplay, hitting at your b pawn.} 35. Ra2 Rd8d2 36. Ra3 {36. Ra3? - I think that white would have done better to have exchanged rooks even if he is going to be an exchange plus pawn to the bad, somehow I feel though that this will only prolong the game.} Rc2 37. a5 b5 {37 ........... b5! - Ion rightly declines the exchange of his b pawn for white's isolani a pawn.  This way, Ion, you can double up on the c pawn and if that falls you have two healthy passers on the b and c files.} 38. h4 Rcc1 {38. ........... Rcc1 - a better move than my suggestion the move before.  The knight must fall.  Ion stated that he eventually wrapped up this game on move 62 as Jim was disinclined to resign games.  Presumably Jim copped Old Matey then, Ion?  If so, I wonder how?  Anyway, very well played, Ion  - Joanne}
