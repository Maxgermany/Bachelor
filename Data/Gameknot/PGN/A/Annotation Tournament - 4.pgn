[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {A lost game simply because key pieces were taken out of the game by whites clever positioning. My queen was on the run, so to speak, and I never really recovered. I would appreciate your comments on anything you would have done differently.   White starts with (A04) the Reti opening.} Na6 {I respond accordingly} 2. e4 {White takes control of the centre} d5 {I put pressure on the centre pawn - no issues here. Another possibiltiy for black is ...d6. 3. Nc3 e5 and allowing ny bishop to progress...we then move into the Vienna (C25).} 3. exd5 {he removes my pawn} Nf6 {Qxd5 is a good option here, but I choose to develop the kings knight. On reflection Qxd4 would have been better although white is still ahead...bf4 and white following with his move, exchanging pieces on a6 might have let me catch up.} 4. Bb5+ {...in check. I thought d4 would have been a stronger move for white here considering he is ahead and to maintain momentum. But who am I to say, I lost!!} Bd7 {I respond accordingly} 5. Bc4 {white could exchange bishops, but chooses to retreat. I thought also that white would have weakened me by removing my a6 knight followed by d4 to strengthen the centre.} Nb4 {and I decide to put pressure on the d file pawn} 6. Nc3 {white covers in preparation} Bf5 {I make an obvious move in preparation for taking the c2 pawn with obvious consequences for white. Maybe a better line would have been 6...Bf5?? 7. Bb5 Bd6 8. Bxd7 Qxd7 and then we both castle. (for black that is!)} 7. Nd4 {white makes the only real move available putting immediate pressure on the f5 bishop} Bg4 {My bishop is somewhat on its own, but I check the queen} 8. f3 {white responds accordingly} Bc8 {and I get the hell out also thinking about e6.} 9. d3 {white develops} Nfxd5 {and I make what I think was a good move at the time} 10. Qe2 {I am not quite sure what white is up to here} e6 {I develop preparing to castle} 11. Ne4 {white has a bettermove here - 11. Nf5} Nb6 {and I do not want to exchange} 12. a3 {an interesting exchange } Qxd4 {which I decide to make} 13. axb4 {white reciprocates} Nxc4 {and I make headway for the bishop} 14. c3 {now this is where it all gets interesting and in all fairness the game is lost on my part (I don't know it yet). My queen is out on a limb and now immediate pressure forces a retreat.} Qe5 {but no, I don't retreat} 15. f4 {more pressure} Qf5 {not much choice} 16. g4 {more pressure} Qd5 {with plans to get back to d8} 17. dxc4 {a good move, the centre is kept and I am still on the run} Qd8 {finally safe - we both discussed my wandering queen at this stage of the game - I felt I had wasted time and that better options were open to me, kindly white commented that I was not "dead yet".} 18. Be3 {white develops} Qh4+ {and I made a silly move, but at the time I thought it was sheer brilliance.....on reflection 18...b6 followed by developing my bishop or thinking about protecting my king with a castle would have been a better option. I had just got her safe and now she is on the run again - a waste of time and eventually loses the game for black.} 19. Bf2 {...this move forces me into a right corner. My queen is now out of the game with no home to put any pressure on my opponent what so ever.} Qh3 {I prevent O-O} 20. O-O-O {so he castles the other way} Be7 {I try to contiunue what development I have left} 21. Bd4 {and white develops as well as forcing me to castle} O-O 22. Be5 {more pressure, maybe a stronger move for white wold have been to move his rook to d3 in preparation for Rd1...what do you think?} a5 {I try to make some movement on the a file} 23. bxa5 {white takes my pawn} Rxa5 {I take it back} 24. Bxc7 {I lose my c file pawn} Ra4 {in preparation for 26...Bb7, which I thought was a good idea} 25. Kc2 {b3 would have been better for white} b5 26. cxb5 Bb7 27. Ng3 Bxh1 28. Nxh1 {white gives up his rook} Bc5 {by now I am in a right mess, perhaps making my queen more active here would have been better} 29. Ng3 {a good move} Ra7 {my 29...Ra7 insists whites next move to e5. The bishop is so strong here and I can not attack} 30. Be5 Qh6 {My queen can retreat, but still out of play - the game is pretty much over for me at this stage. I am out of position and have lost material. I have no attack, but I look at the position for some time and attempt to make some sense from it....} 31. Ne4 {more pressure and a retreat, white could have moved the g pawn to pressure my fair lady forcing Qg6+, but Ne4 would follow forcing Bb6.} Bb6 32. Rd6 {and again} Bg1 {at first I thought this was going to be a good idea, but I think in my mind I had lost and did not look closely enough at f5 to prevent my Qxh2.} 33. f5 Be3 {my only move} 34. b6 {more pressure} Ra4 35. Qd3 {preparing to kill} Bxb6 {I stell a pawn feeling the exchange is nescesary to prevent white gaining an extra queen (eventually) and protecting d8.} 36. Rxb6 Qh4 {I am now well behind - e5 bishop is very strong preventing my queen from doing anything constructive at all.} 37. Kb3 {more pressure and game over......} Ra5 38. Bd6 {and again - I am congratulating my opponent at this stage - he reminds me that resigning now would mean less annotating - I replied by saying the annotation would be very quick anyway!} Rd5 {I studied for a way out at least as I hate resigining - so I tried this...} 39. Qe2 {queen retreats} Qd8 {pressure (for once)} 40. Qa6 {although protecting the rook, this is an excellent attacking move too - whites knight is very strong, I am going to lose my rook....all is but over.} Re8 41. Rb8 Qd7 42. Rb7 {attacking my queen} Qc8 43. f6 g6 44. Qa7 {preparing beautifully for the finish} Ra5 {my final offer of sacrifice was not taken and I resign. Well played Dave! } 45. Qb6 {The end.}
