1. f4 {Another tournament game, for me this comes while my rating is at its lowest range for some considerable time. This game however was over in only 6 moves.} e5 {Tournament start position, Bird opening, From Gambit.} 2. fxe5 {Nothing much wrong with this move, it's been a common one in the tournament.} d6 {A bit of me thinks this is is a strange move and I have had mixed success with it in the tournament. } 3. exd6 Nf6 {For me this move was a bit of an experiment, previous efforts had mostly revolved around Bxd6 but here I stuck with the old adage of getting knights out before bishops. The gameknot database seems to indicate this as promising too.  From my perspective I was starting to get ideas about a possible Ne4 and Qh4 early attack, trying to take advantage of the e1-h4 open diagonal} 4. dxc7 Qxc7 {No real alternative here that I could see and I would love to get my queen to g3} 5. d4 {This is the sort of normal developing move that with the benefit of hindsight looks quite weak. I'm not sure what would be better, perhaps e3 or Nc2} Bg4 {Looking to tease the h pawn forward, if that doesn't work then the e pawn is still pinned to the queen and I have Bd6 threatening a bishop sac on h2, perhaps Bd6 would have been the better move, I'm still not entirely sure.} 6. h3 {This is the losing move for white.} Qg3+ {White resigned due to Kd2, Ne4#  Many thanks for reading please comment.}
