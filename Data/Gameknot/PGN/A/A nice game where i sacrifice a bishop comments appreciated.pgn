1. e4 {ive been practicing black alot and my white isnt that great im used to going e4 xx nf3} e5 2. Bc4 {this time i planned a early castle king side with opening up my lane for the rook with a f4 before knight} Nf6 {i was hoping he wouldnt bring bishop out yet and perfect he didnt} 3. d3 h6 {i hadnt planned on using my black bishop yet so this move was help to my development i dont think he expect what i was gonna do} 4. f4 d6 {i dont wanna park my bishop on f4 hes pawn defense i think anticipates this. im just opening the lane for my rook} 5. fxe5 dxe5 6. Nf3 {develop knight for castle} Bd6 {this move almost made me change my plan and since i was looking for an aggressive game i was hoping he would exchange pawns to let me queen out lol} 7. d4 Nc6 8. d5 {here i prefer pushing pawns then exchanging and was hoping the knight would kick down to d4 to exchange knights bring either queen up or castle first and accepting a pawn down wasnt sure id have to wait and see what he did} Ne7 {i dont want to castle before he does so he doesnt decide to switch to a queen side castle either since hes ready to castle now so i position my bishop on a better square} 9. Be3 O-O 10. O-O {good time to castle right after his} Bg4 11. Nbd2 c6 12. h3 {hes pretty compacted in and the pressure tactics are starting} cxd5 13. exd5 Bh5 14. Qe2 {here after i moved my queen i regreted my thought was to connect the rooks and i wanted to head her on to f2 and in the lanes of the king, i shouldve went e2 first} Nexd5 {i didnt wanna lose my bishop on an exchange having my white bishop nicely placed and my rook in open file i went for a sacrifice of the bishop on the pawn and gamble a huge melee with a bishop down} 15. Bxh6 gxh6 16. Ne4 {here if he exchanges knights i develop my queen higher but im really hoping he doesnt exchange} Qe7 {this is perfect he doesnt exchange knights so ill make sure it moves} 17. Bxd5 Nxd5 18. g4 {kick the bishop im not afraid that he will trade white bishop for knight} Bg6 19. g5 {2 knights barreling on the pawn hoping to open the king up even more hope my black bishop didnt die in vain so far hes been countering to keep up his 3 point diff} hxg5 20. Nfxg5 f5 {he forces the exchange here i hope he eats the knight on e6} 21. Nxd6 Qxd6 {he does} 22. Rad1 {peg his knight bring my other rook in action now my plan is looking a bit dreary and my bishop sacrifice not too good but i dont let up} Qb6+ {i almost moved king but then realised  ke3 after is really devastating. 1 time im happy i didnt play too fast out of reaction lol} 23. Rf2 Rad8 {he leaves a pawn open which is perfect having a high placed knight now my plan starts to see a light at the end of the tunnel} 24. Qxe5 Nf6 {he forces the rook exchange which is fine with knight and bishop where they are i dont see him getting my second rook knight nor queen} 25. Rxd8 Qxd8 {i was expecting him to eat with rook not with queen cause i was gonna fork with my knight i dont think he saw the fork} 26. Ne6 Re8 {defends with rook here i think a minute i dont want to exchange queens i have to find a way to kick his knight for Qg7 Checkmate. think a while i think this was a good move for the situation} 27. Re2 Qd7 {my thought he paniced after the fork and all the pressure i was putting forgot to cover his knight or i think he didnt realise Qg7 checkmate was looming and he planned his efforts on attacking e6} 28. Qxf6 Bf7 {perfect conclusion for both sides wasnt to strategic lol but i my plan was to play a big melee with well timed exchanges and it paid off i hope you guys enjoyed the game} 29. Qg7# {}
