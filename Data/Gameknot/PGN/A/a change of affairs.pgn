1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 {a common move} Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. c5 Nd5 {at this point the knight is safe and cannot be harmed as it is on an outpost} 5. d4 d6 6. Bc4 Be6 {the complexity is of this central position} 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. Ng5 Qd7 9. Qf3 f6 10. Bxd5 fxg5 11. Qh5+ {not such a bad move because after g6 qxg5 bxb  exd6 the bishop must move or be protected giving two pawns for a bishop} g6 12. Qxg5 Bxd5 13. O-O {i was stumped by this move} Nxd4 {i should have movged my bishop} 14. exd6 Qc6 15. Nc3 e6 16. dxc7 Bf3 {with the obvious intention pxb nxp winning the queen} 17. Bf4 Bxc5 18. Qf6 Rf8 19. Qg7 Rxf4 20. Qg8+ Bf8 21. Qxh7 Rg4 22. g3 Bh1 23. Qh3 {this when the game gets confusing and i start to make mistakes} Bb4 24. Rae1 Nf3+ {a definite mistsake} 25. Kxh1 Nxe1+ 26. f3 {this gets very confusing, the rook is no longer protected by the threat of checkmate and the queen is free} Rd4 27. Qh8+ {a change of affairs } Kd7 28. Qxa8 Kxc7 {taking away the troublesome pawn} 29. Rxe1 Rd1 {a risky move, it could have got sticky if he had taken with the kight} 30. Rxd1 {fortunately not} Qxf3+ 31. Kg1 Bc5+ {the position as it stands} 32. Rd4 {the only move available} Bxd4# {my finishing blow}
