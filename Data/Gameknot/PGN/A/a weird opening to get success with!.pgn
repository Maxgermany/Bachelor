1. a3 {first time at trying thsi} d5 {takes control of the centre} 2. d4 {but i'm not going to play too bad an opening} e6 {usual} 3.

Nf3 {still defending and developing} Nf6 {he also decides to develop} 6. Be2 {i need to make my bishop reach a strong position} Bd6 {what's he trying?} 7. dxc5 {i don't mind now that i am better defended} Bxc5 {there we are} 8. b4 {back off } Bd6 {he does} 9. Nb5 {get lost bishop!} a6 {oh no- he wants a swap off} 10. Nxd6+ {i oblige} Qxd6 {he keeps us even} 11. c4 {hoping to get that queen} Nxb4 {what?} 12. axb4 { i can now get in the lead} Qxb4+ {expected} 13. Bd2 {but that was obviously going to keep me in the lead} Qc5 {queen is pushed back} 14. Qb3 {defend that pawn- why not?} Bd7 {the bishop makes its way into the game} 15. Qxb7 {but that was a proper blunder or was it?} Bc6 {i think it was} 16. Qc7 {now that bishop is pinned} O-O {the king flees} 17. Ra5 {pressure on the queen} Ra7 {a swap off?} 18. Qxf7+ {but that was a mistake on black's part} Rfxf7 {i can get that queen now and...} 19. Rxc5 {be further in the lead} Ba4 {that bishop also moves away} 20. O-O {i need to get my king to safety} dxc4 {uh} 21. Bxc4 {bishop is threatening to pin that rook on f7} Rfe7 {black is no fool} 22. Rc8+ {oooh} Kf7 {sorry black but...} 23. Ne5# {didn't see that CHECKMATE coming. Note that Ng5 is not mate. It turns out that opening was rather successful for me or was it the fact that i only won because of some careless blunders on black's part! yay for me though!}
