1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 {So far, only very common moves in the Ruy Lopez opening. Had this position quite a lot of times on gameknot already.} d6 {0-0 seems to be a bit more common here, but still a pretty common move.} 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 Na5 10. Bc2 c5 11. d4 Qc7 12. Nbd2 {still, only common moves so far.} Bd7 {That move was new to me, I only knew cxd4 here.} 13. Nf1 Rfe8 14. Ne3 {The last book move according to gameknot analyzer} cxd4 15. cxd4 Rac8 16. b3 {And here we seem to be back in a book variation ;-). Guess this position is usually reached from a slightly different line.} Nc6 17. Bb2 Nb4 {doesn't seem to be a book move, but looks strong to me... forces me to a decision (keep the bishop or not?)} 18. Re2 {I decided to let my opponent have it and develop my pieces a bit more. Gameknot Analyzer doesn't like the decision and prefers Bb1} Nxc2 19. Rxc2 Qb7 20. dxe5 {the last move that existed in gameknot database... } Rxc2 21. Qxc2 Nxe4 {All these moves were still in gameknot database.} 22. Rd1 Be6 23. exd6 Nxd6 {For the moment, I control the c and d file} 24. Nd4 {Going for the bishop} Bd7 25. Ndf5 Nxf5 26. Nxf5 {there was no way to 'save' the bishop pair here for black...} Bf8 {and now, we reached the key position. I'm pretty sure the expected move here was Nd6, forking the rook and the queen. Initially (at move 24) I really had this in mind. After Nd6 black would have to take on d6 with the bishop, which I would take with my rook. The chances for both sides seem pretty equal here, for me it also already looked a bit drawish.  While seeing this position however, I suddenly had a pretty 'strange' idea... a move which I would never have done if the team 2vs2 team match wouldn't have been lost already...} 27. Nh6+ {?! / !? (either dubious or interesting, probably both).  A truly weird seeming knight sacrifice. But it leads to a few forced moves. Black gets my knight and for that, I get 2 pawns and the black king has to travel back to the middle.  What actually really surprised me though is that this move isn't critisized by GK analyzer... I still think it is dubious though, especially for a rather unexperienced player like me.  The next few moves were pretty much forced and easy to see from that position. Until move 31 the choices were pretty clear.} gxh6 {Pretty much forced, as the only other option would have been Kh8, which would have given me a free pawn with Nxf7+} 28. Qc3 {Threatening Qh8#} f6 {Only move that can prevent the mate (Rh5 would have been useless ;-) )} 29. Qxf6 {pretty much forced, I want the 2 pawns ;-)} Re6 {Seems to be a strong move to me, as this covers some possible later squares for my queen.} 30. Qh8+ {Following my plan} Kf7 {Only move} 31. Qxh7+ {2nd pawn gone ;-)} Ke8 {And the king is back to his initial square.} 32. Qg8 {Pinning the Bishop and threatening Bg7} Ke7 {This move surprised me a bit, I was rather expecting Bc8, which would have given the black queen control over the 7th row.  However, here it seems as white has not many attacking possibilities left, and black has 1 more minor piece anyway. I probably thought about 1 hour here about what to do next...} 33. Rd4 {!? (probably this move is even worth an '!', but I don't like to give my own moves this rating unless it is firesure proven that the move is good)  I finally spotted this move, it threatens amazingly many things. One threat is of course Ba3 (which couldn't be defended with b4 anymore because of the rook move), it would eventually win the black bishop on f8. The other threat is Rf4, which attacks the same bishop in a different way. The question here is... is there a way how black can handle both threats? I didn't find a possibility... and my opponent didn't either (if there is one, please tell me)... at least this makes me a bit proud to have spotted this move.} Re1+ {Logical, but doesn't help} 34. Kh2 {Only move} Qc7+ {?!  That move seems to be inaccurate. GK analyzer suggests a5 but anyway, the Bishop on f8 seems lost} 35. g3 {forced} a5 {The strongest defense, I think} 36. Rf4 {what else? ;-)} Qc8 {GK shows +3.82 here... } 37. Rf7+ {?? However, I didn't find the best move here. Of course, I can get the bishop this way, but after something like ...Kd6 38. Qxf8+ Qxf8 39. Rxf8 Re2 40. Bd4 (or maybe Bg7) Rxa2, black wins the a pawn and his 2 pawns on a5 and b5 could have become dangerous. And since the end game is one of my main weaknesses (beside of the openings and the middle game), it might even have ended in a draw.  The best move here would have been 37. Qh7! , followed by something like ...Kd8 38. Rxf8+ Re8 39. Qxh6 Rxf8 40. Qxf8+ Kc7, and I would simply have been 3 pawns up.    } Kd6 {pretty much forced} 38. Qg6+ {!? My main idea here was to chase the king to the other side and try to get that bishop with check from my rook, so that I have 1 more tempo and can save my a2 pawn with that. This was probably a bit too optimistic, but probably worth a try. A possible idea was 38. ...Re6 39. Qd3+ Kc7 40. Qc3+ Kb7 41. Qxc8+ Kxc8 42. Rxf8+ Kb7 43. Bd4 Re2 44. a4 or  38. ...Re6 39. Qd3+ Kc7 40. Qc3+ Kb6 41. Qxc8 Bxc8 42. Rxf8 Re2 43. Bd4+ which both would have saved the a pawn. But I was also aware that 40. ...Kb8 would have avoided this...  Amusingly, I made another oversight by considering these possibilities, but we'll come to that later.    } Re6 {The best defense, I think. ...Be6? would easily have been answered with 39. Qf6. And just moving the king away would have let the rook in an unsave position.} 39. Qd3+ {...as planned} Kc7 {also...} 40. Qc3+ {that too...} Rc6 {?  And that was my oversight... I just can't explain why I didn't see the possibility that black can simply protect his king with his rook. Even more amusing however... this move looks good but is pretty bad, it might even have been blacks losing move. } 41. Qxa5+ {Easy to find... no direct way to get the bishop, but at least I can get his 2 pawns.} Kb8 {Everthing else would have given me the possibility to gain his f8-Bishop or his rook for my bishop.} 42. Qxb5+ {Another pawn with another check. At this position I have 4 pawns for my bishop, and as well I have a lot of attacking possibilities. So it really seems to be a clear advantage for me.} Kc7 {?! I think Ka8 was better here.} 43. Bd4 {!? Threatens Qa5+} Ra6 {Avoids that move} 44. Bc3 {!? That move looks weird, but the Idea behind it was ... 45. Rxd7+ Qxd7  46. Qxa6, winning a bishop and trading the rooks. With the Bishop on d4 however, black could have played 46. ... Qxd4 } Be7 {? Desperation?} 45. Rxe7 {No reason not to take} Rxa2 {Doesn't help} 46. Ba5+ {?! Rh7 seems stronger according to GK analyzer, but this moves wins as well.} Kd6 47. Qe5+ Kc6 48. Qf6+ Kb7 49. Qd6 {even the black queen is lost now...} Ka8 50. Rxd7 Rxa5 51. Rd8 {And black resigned.  After all, a pretty strange, but also interesting game, I find. Hope you enjoyed it.  What makes it even more special is that it allowed me to pass 2000 points for the first time ;-) (while I think I still play worse than most 1900's, but well)}
