[Opening "English (A22), Bellon gambit"]

1. c4 {My traditional style. The good thing about the opening choice is that it very versatile. With all the different openings that you turn into, t can be used against any opponent as you can change your game plan early on. I like to control pace and create slow method games. I too like to be flexible which is another benefit. Early on I spend time learning to avoid traps with it. Now I know them and defend against them well.} e5 2. Nc3 {White begin development. My goal is gain control of light squares, and put pressure on d5.} Nf6 {Black counter add protection to d5 and attack e4.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e3 {With knight on f3, I don't like fianchetto option. So I activate my bishop a different way.} Bb4 {Black challenge my plan of attack early and prepare for castle. Without fianchetto I cannot go for full light square challenge like I want, but I do have some control still.} 5. Qc2 {Protect the knight and control b1-h7 diagonal. } d6 {Protect e5 and to actvate over diagonal. } 6. Nd5 {Here I make a decision to switch style. I want to get rid of c3 knight and open my diagonal for a possible queen side attack later in game.} Ba5 7. a3 {Pressure the Bishop and get Black to remove my knight with trade.} Nxd5 8. cxd5 Ne7 {Force Black into a bit of retreat while I continue my develop} 9. Bc4 O-O {Black protect king and complete development.} 10. O-O {Activate my other bishop need to occur soon. I looking for a way to involve it but the space closed off. Not ideal situation.} Bg4 {Black attack my kingside, but I ok with let Black open up my king because I feel I have good protection to keep me out of danger.} 11. b4 {Allow my bishop to go to b2 and connect my rook to complete development. Also look for flank attack to Black kingside.} Bxf3 12. gxf3 Bb6 13. Bb2 {Develop complete and yes my kingside is not safe, there is not much Black can do to take advantage of weakness at this point. The knight is stuck since it retreat, the queen has not enter game, and the Bishop is retreat to Black queenside almost out of game.} Qd7 {Black see hole at h3. I also see it and proceed to protect it.} 14. Kg2 a5 {One of Black 2 response. The other I see is Ng6. Both have good potential but I probably prefer Ng6 if I play Black.} 15. Rfg1 axb4 16. axb4 Rxa1 17. Bxa1 Ng6 {A reaction to this move is to go Kh1. I decide not to do this yet, but I know my king is in danger} 18. Be2 {Protect my pawn first then move my king. Though now there is no protect on d5} Ra8 19. Bc3 {Black now control open file. Keep eye on this but not my immediate concern.} Qd8 20. Kh1 Qh4 {The problem with the Kh1 move. Expose weakness in king pawn structure. I thought for a bit on proper sequence to protect.} 21. Rg3 {Of all response I like this best. Black cannot easily contest the fort I now have for king.} Rf8 {Prepare for f5 push and eventually f4 to attack the rook.} 22. Qf5 {Seeing the board and position I am in, I decide to remove the f5 option from the equation. } Ne7 {Black immediately challenge as expect.} 23. Qe4 {I move here knowing Black will not exchange queens since Black need queen to sustain attack on king.} Qh5 24. Qc4 {Now that I have an eye on Bishop, I decide on a plan to send queen away from white kingside.} f6 {Create escape route for queen} 25. f4 {Attack queen and indirect protect rook. } Qh6 26. Qe4 Kh8 {I feel this is a mistake. Black should take the f-pawn and keep pressure on my weak structure. Since Black not take I now take initiative.} 27. fxe5 fxe5 28. f4 {Prevent Black to weaken white structure and prevent a disaster from occur.} Qh4 29. Bd3 {Attack h7} Ng6 30. fxe5 {I open the file for Black rook but weaken pawn structure. Plus I force Black to give up queen. } Qxe4+ 31. Bxe4 {With queens gone bishop pair should allow whte to win.} Nxe5 32. Rh3 h6 33. Kg2 Re8 34. Rh4 Kg8 {Here I agree to a draw because it was hard at the time to fully concentrate just based on the amount of work I have from school. Still solid result, but perhaps if I look to exploit Bishop pair and see Black not have any control over white squares. But again, I appreciate strong play from strong opponent.}
