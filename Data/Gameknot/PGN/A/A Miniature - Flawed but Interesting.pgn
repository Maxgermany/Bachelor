[Opening "Reti (A07), King's Indian attack, Keres variation"]

1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Bg4 {I go by the old motif that knights move before bishops in the opening, as bishops usually take time to find their correct positions, whereas knight can pop out easily without much choice of position. } 3. Bg2 Bxf3 {I found this strange. Maybe black wanted to dominate the black center squares, but usually exchaning a bishop for a knight like this is not effective in the beginning. If the position was closed, it woud make sense, but here the bishop should be waiting to pin my knight after an inevitable e4 in the King's Indian Attack. } 4. Bxf3 Nc6 5. O-O e6 {I understand that black wanted to defend d5, but there is no need to worry now. e5 in my opinion was stronger. } 6. d4 {I divereged from a King's Indian Attack to get into a Catalan type position. I played d4 as it the logical move when black allows me space.} Nf6 7. Nc3 Bb4 {I don't see the point of the bishop here - it's not pinning anything and only threatening to take the knight on c3, which would limit my force on e4. But black exchanging another bishop for a knight would be a significant positional mistake, as two bishops versus two knights in a relatively open position is deadly. } 8. Bf4 Bxc3 {Well, black carried through with the plan, but as I said, I think this is a positional error. } 9. bxc3 {Not all doubled pawns are bad. Doubled pawns such as these help reinforce the center and attack the center with eventual pushes, such as c4. } O-O 10. Qd3 {Connecting my rooks and giving support to an eventual c4 push, as well as protecting the e4 square. } Re8 {A good continuation. At this time, I got scared of an e5 push and got stressed looking for the best continuation. I didn't see that 11.Rb1 e5 12.Bxe5 Nxe5 13.dxe5 Rxe5 14. Rxb7. Instead, I thought of countering with 11.c4, with the idea of ...e5 and 12.cxd5, with a really complicated game. But, I got blinded by thinking about e5 and forgot that playing c4 only loses a pawn and puts me in a bad position. } 11. c4 dxc4 12. Qxc4 Qxd4 {Now black won a pawn and has a better position, all because I got blinded by the variations of 11.c4 e5....} 13. Qb5 {Producing counterplay by attacking the knight and b7 pawn. Black has only one legitimate move. } Qb6 14. Qg5 {Part of the plan. Use the queenside counterplay as a springboard to jump to the kingside. I didn't know if it would produce any results, but at least it looked promising and imposing. } h6 {What I wanted: black to weaken their kingside. } 15. Qh4 {White does not need to fear the fork on g5, as it results in a cool draw with perpetual checks and attacks to the black queen. Hard to calculate exactly, but it works. } Nd5 {Now black is showing the power of his knights - well played. I think black exchanged bishops early because he loves his knights so much and it shows in his play. } 16. Rfd1 Nd4 {Once again, effective maneuvering by black's knights. Now white is in a poor position, despite having two bishops. } 17. Rab1 {I try a little counterplay to see how black reacts. The black queen is guarding the black knight and must be careful not to be driven away. } Qa6 {Black somehow forgot that the black queen protected the knight. Qc5 or Nxf3+ were logicial choices. Though this blunder makes the game much easier for me, the attack following this blunder is what really makes the game interesting. } 18. Rxd4 Nc3 {With an attack with check on e2 and an attack on my rook, black does not seem to be so bad. For a while, I was considering the complications after Bxb7, which was interesting. But I concluded that I wanted to get checkmate if possible, as I had a decent plan on the kingside with all those pieces more or less hanging out there. Therefore, I chose to focus on the kingside and see what black would do about it. } 19. Bxh6 {(!) Now that the bishop has taken on h6, it has made clearance for the rook to come to g4. Black dare not take back the bishop, 19... gxh6 20. Qxh6 is a forced mate with Rg4. } Nd5 {I neat defense by black, thinking about Ne7-f5. Bxg7 right now is interesting, and as I calculated, it should win for white, though it takes a while. But I found a faster way to win. } 20. Qg5 g6 21. e4 {c4 was possible as well, but e4 blocks the knight from coming to f5 to defend a while longer. Chess is ruthless. } Qxa2 22. exd5 {I didn't care about my rook, as I only wanted to checkmate the quickest way possible. It also looks cool giving away a rook at the end, haha. } Qxb1+ 23. Kg2 Qxc2 {Since black's queen was stuck on the queenside, she could not provide the defense that was needed. } 24. Qf6 {A flawed miniature, that mixed luck and tactical calculation to win the game. }
