1. e4 d6 2. d4 e6 3. Nc3 a6 4. Nf3 Ne7 5. Be2 Ng6 6. O-O Be7 7. Be3 b6 {Black seems determined not to influence White's development in the least. Here Bd3 will provide knight movement to e2 so the c pawn can complete the pawn chain that will no doubt get rolling against Black's static defence. Or so I thought. Until I realised during that 2 move sequence the lcb could get to a4 and disrupt the whole plan. Plus it's too slow and backwards. Development appears complete so time to rattle Black's cages!  No, dissolving the centre that you control for no clear reason. Your development is sound, Ba4 is no impediment, it leads to a better pawn chain!   8.	Bd3	Bd7 9.	Ne2	Ba4 10.	Nc3	Bd7 11.	Ne2	Ba4 12.	b3	Bc6 13.	c4	} 8. Bd3 Bb7 {Ha! Black is chasing ghosts! I had considered attack on the long light diagonal but ruled it out as unwieldly and easily blocks. None the less, Black has jumped at the shadow and allowed my knight to move safely to e2 in preparation for both the erection of the pawn chain AND the kingside castle from black. Just as in our complimentary team game, Tipsy is setting up the knight pairing on the side his opponent will castle to, on the very move that his opponent will do the castling. It reminds me of Doctor Who:  "Where's the Doctor?" "Where he always is, right behind you. And a step ahead."   8.	Bd3	Bb7 9.	Ne2	d5 10.	e5	f6 11.	c3	  } 9. Ne2 Nd7 10. c3 c5 {White has 4 pieces with which to recapture on d4, so exchanging here is no problem. White instead must decide what to do with its free move; Black either follows through on this threat, waste time bringing the e pawn or bishop to try and even up the odds on d4 or do something unrelated to this move which will cost tempo. Either way, White has a free move and must use it wisely. Action on the Qside seems the preferred option. } 11. Ng3 {Mimicks the position from the complimentary game against rugged, but more importantly, 4 pieces is actually too many to be concentrated on the one spot unless it's going to be a pivotal point of attack. All lines involving a qside movement of the pawns or Q appeared to weaken White's position considerably and give a look-in to black, as did e5, h/g3 or 4, leaving only pointless Q or Rook movements along the back 2 ranks as alternatives to Ng3. Eliminate all the weak moves and whatever remains, however improbable, must be your strongest! } O-O 12. d5 {Black has declined to exchange on d4 so White decides to up the ante a little. Here, if Blak takes the bait, then White could go up 2 in material:   12.	d5	exd5 13.	exd5	Bxd5 14.	Bxg6	fxg6 15.	Qxd5+  If not and Black moves say 12...Ne5 or something else, then c4 (eventually) moves up to form a new pawn chain, shut down Black's long diagonal and keep central control. Thus, like any good, mature trap, if Black doesn't take the bait, White is still furthered by the move. Blacks d8-h4 diagonal is a little uncomfortable as well so anything which distracts Black from utilising it must be in White's favour. At the end of the day, despite having a similar position to the complimentary game, here a slightly different sequence of moves has my opponent slightly stronger and less vulnerable to a Qside roll. Thus a central thrust is required and a little threat is created. How Black responds to this little threat may have far-reaching consequences for the game. } e5 {Black plays it with a straight bat. The c4 move beckons to wedge up the centre. Nf5 is flirted with but Black, despite it all, has alarming strength on the kside due to that Q-B diagonal. White is unprepared to initiate action on the Kside; any attempt to attack Black's fortress will leave White's vulnerable and Black's greater weight of material would prove telling. Instead, sticking to the gameplay; the c4 and ensuing wedge gives White better prospects to finally get rolling Qside. } 13. c4 Bc8 {It took me a while to understand this but it's simple really. The long diagonal is shut down; nothing Black has can sensibly attack d5, the wedge has firmly clamped down the centre. Black, then, is posturing to control the open c8-h3 diagonal. It was at this point I realised 2 things: 1. My queenside roll would have to wait a little as White's fortress is coming under increasing pressure. 2. The solution to that Q-B pairing on the d8-h4 diagonal has been staring me in the face for a while! Qd2 allows Bg5 and either Black sticks the f pawn in the way or exchanges bishops, either way dashing aside that powerful threat I've been whinging about for a while! } 14. Qd2 {Also connects rooks and leaves options open for supporting qside involvement. Does weaken the f3 square a little but the lcb bishop can move back a pace if support is needed there. Given action is about to occur on the black squares anyway, a slightly weakened white square is of little concern atm.   } Nf6 {Black does as predicted and gains control of the c8-h3 diagonal but rather sooner than expected. Black has now blocked the very diagonal that's been a strategic thorn in my side for a while. Black's lcb bishop is acting as the "good" bishop here to White's "bad" lcb except clearly White's bishop has chosen a defensive, supporting role so it's not really all that bad. Just pointing out how stupid those two terms are. :)  ANYWAY h3 becomes enticing. Black's knight would not be able to move forward, giving White less headaches about the Q-dcb pairing and possibly more play on the kingside accordingly.   Linking the pawn chain up at b3 is also an option but could cost valuable tempo. White checks for other options....} 15. h3 {...and decides on h3 after all. Suddenly that good (or as I like to call it, sober) bishop isn't looking so grand; there are only 2 squares on its current diagonal which are safe. Indeed White's pawn structure is dampening the efficacy of the lcb considerably. The bad (or as I like to call it, drunk) bishop winks at its opposite number, has another drink and stays comfortable at the bar, surrounded by its pawn mates. Black has shown some interesting manoeuvering all game, the state of play is till fairly (if not completely) even, but will they continue to hold their nerve?} Kh8 {???? Error or sound positional move? } 16. b4 {At any rate, lacking the super-long vision of the masters to figure out just why the heck Black moved Kh8, instead White opts for finally, at last, getting it's qside motoring. The kside has been all locked up with that odd choice to put the knight on f6 and White's reply, so now to exploit the Qd2 movement as it was previously annotated that this does allow White to mount a charge down the qside. } Ng8 17. bxc5 dxc5 {Rc1 for an eventual doubling of rooks on the b file is a possible plan here, a logical follow up to the exchange of pawns. However, out of the corner of my eye, Nf5 beckons. 18. Nf5 Bxf5? 19. exf5! Nf4 (forced) 20. Bxf4 exf4 21. Qxf4 and Black has dropped a pawn. However the move can easily be refuted through 17...Bf6 which opens up an escape square for the knight. Black has shown sufficient skill in their play to give me every reason to believe they will find the refutation or at least work out Bxf5 is not in their favour. Should the trap not be sprung, White can easily move back to g3 and though it hasn't cost them any in position, it will cost in tempo. Thus is the position I find myself in, essentially asking, "Do I feel lucky, punk?" } 18. Nf5 {Allons-y! I decide that, if this move is turn aside, White won't be that worse off. But, if Black makes an unlikely slip, well, then could be an absolute game-breaker. } Bf6 19. Rad1 {White is loth to retreat its knight and throw away a move, but Bxf5 exf5, e4 would be terrible for White as bishop, knight would be forked and a discovered attack on the rook would also be revealed. Rab1 was my first instinct to avoid this wicked fate, but the doubling on the d file could have some nasty implications for Black....} Ng6e7 {A possible miscalculation here from Black. Vacating the space behind the bishop was a logical and almost forced move. Moving into that space now vacated, is not. I think I wrote in a different annotation somewhere that a good move too early or soon oft becomes a mistake. I'm not sure if I'm ready to give this the full blown mistake tag but I will assign it as a possible inaccuracy. What I do know is this takes care of the (mini) problems created by the failed attempt to draw an error from Black with Nf5. The position of that piece could have created problems for White in the late middle but here a potential pressure point is removed. Exchange in material, I'm calling this a slight positional win for White. Especially since, after this, White can get back to deconstructing that diagonal of Black's I was moaning about what seems like an age ago. } 20. Nxe7 Bxe7 {That WAS a mistake. Surprising given how precise Black had been up till now. After all those little traps baited for Black finally one has sprung. Black goes down a pawn. } 21. Nxe5 Bd6 22. Nc6 {Black took all of 2 minutes for that response, a transparent move in anger. The knight comfortably avoids the bishop and settles into an imposing position. Black's position will disintegrate swiftly if composure isn't regained. } Qe8 {Qe8 not bad though I probably would have moved Qc7.} 23. Rdb1 {Pressuring the hanging pawn. It cannot move to b5 (drops a pawn) so now Black will have to waste a move supporting it. Part of the reason I favoured Qc7 as Black's 22nd move. } Bd7 {Or Black can just drop another pawn. } 24. Rxb6 Bxc6 {Black drops its third pawn in four moves. I'm seriously beginning to think I've overrated this opponent. Black's army is proving not to be very rugged at all! } 25. Rxc6 {The only question here is whether Black will choose to drop the c5 or a6 pawn. Unless of course they completely stuff up and drop a bishop instead!} Qe5 26. f4 Qe7 27. e5 Bxe5 {As it turns out, Black drops a bishop instead. The net loss is 2 instead of the full 3 so that White goes to +4 instead of +3 after 25 Rxc6. Black shows an inability to deal with any level of complexity once battle is joined. Definitely shown too much respect in the opening and early middle, but far better to err on that side than the other! } 28. fxe5 Qxe5 29. Bxc5 Rfe8 {Black is dropping material like Hansel dropping bread crumbs. } 30. Rxf7 Nf6 31. Rcxf6 {There goes the knight. I wonder if Black will fall into the mating trap by capturing that rook with pawn?} gxf6 {Yes. Yes he will. } 32. Rxh7+ Kg8 33. Rh8+ Kf7 34. Bg6+ {And it's all over again. I don't know whether I should consider this an opponent inevitably cracking under supreme play by Tipsy....or a lacklustre ability by an opponent to deal with rudimentary tactical calculations once blood starts spilling, spoiling what could have been a battle royale. Oh well, either way, victory to the Tips!}
