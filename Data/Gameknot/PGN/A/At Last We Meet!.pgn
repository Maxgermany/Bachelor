[Black "jkarp (1268)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B54)"]

1. e4 {King's Pawn. "Best by test" according to Fischer. Played so often by Tipsy the FIDE database of openings (if that is a thing) should really be updated to call this "Tipsy's Opening". Or, the Australian Opening. :) } c5 {Sicilian. Love to play it as Black, love to take it apart as White. There really is nothing like knowing the ins and outs of a particular (and popular) opening so that you are supremely confident playing either side of the opening. } 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {The Chekhover variation, but really, to term this a variation is a bit odd since, to me, this is the main line of the Sicilian. } cxd4 {Main line but not, in my opinion a good one. More on that in a moment. } 4. Nxd4 {Back to what the database calls the Sicilian, supporting my suggestion that the Chekhover really is the main line. } a6 5. Nc3 {Personally, this would be a situation I'd avoid if playing Black. White now has a developed knight pairing, whilst Black has gained....really...nothing. There is no great check on White's intended development or claims for the centre, nor has Black really staked any crucial outposts on the flank. Honestly, for a mid-ranker or below, I believe the main lines of the Sicilian, once White plays Nf3, begin the death toll for Black if he sticks to book. Instead, at 3.d4, I think Black is better with the 3....Nf6 movement. } e5 6. Nb3 Be6 7. Bd3 Nf6 8. O-O Bxb3 {Black scrambles to make up for its short-fallings with aggresive play and a disruption of White's knight pair, generating a doubled pawn. But, less speed more haste when it comes to chess. Holes are appearing in Black's defensive lines, whilst White, who has already castled, is building now for the attack on Black's position. For the doubled pawn, White also gains the semi-open file and an activated rook, which will prove pivotal later in the game. } 9. axb3 d5 10. b4 {There's an Ozzie song by Boom Crash Opera titled, "Dancing in the Storm." The Chorus; "Here we go, here we go for one more turn We can shake, we can shake the trees and earth We can spin, We can spin and not fall down Hold on tight, we can both become unwound You and I are going out And we're dancing in the storm."  This is what the b3 pawn was singing as it marched forward to the b4 square. So many times a doubled pawn is cleaned up by an exchange or sacrifice which this movement, ultimately, is. However, in order to accept the sac, Black must move its Q boldly forth. From here the dance in the storm begins....} Bxb4 11. Nxd5 Nxd5 12. exd5 Qxd5 {Out comes that Q to gobble that pawn. Now, against a different player I would not have tossed that morsel out, but against Joe I had reason to suspect that a little trap I was setting would be sprung....} 13. Qh5 {White threatens to recapture on h7 with the bishop, but it's really a rope-a-dope. White, instead, is inhibiting Black's kingside castle (mate in 1 were Black to castle here), keeping Black's Q hanging loose in the centre, along with its dcb and e pawn. } g6 14. Qh4 {Now the bishop is under threat. It should be noted that poppy-cock about good and bad bishops means little here. White's dcb hasn't even moved and won't move for the entirety of this game. Black's dcb instead, is roving round the board looking powerful. But instead it's a distraction for Black that takes its attention away from the real weakness: that forward Queen which also looks strong in that centre but is really soon to be exposed as weak. } Be7 15. Qa4+ {Black withdraws the bishop and, in doing so, opens up the 4th rank for White's Queen. Much is written about open files, but, remember, open ranks are the same number of squares for one's Queen or Rooks to run about on! } b5 {Oh deary-deary me. The trap is about to be sprung.} 16. Bxb5+ Kd8 17. Qa5+ Kc8 18. Bxa6+ Rxa6 19. Qxd5 Rxa1 {Best outcome for Black. (I think. I've lost my lines for the game but I'm pretty sure once White moved exd5 this was the best they could get out of the ensuing whirlwind. I certainly remember telling Joe that in the chat so I shall presume it to be true! :D ) The 2 in material that Black is down is, however, amplified by the unchallenged Q and the wide open king. } 20. Qxe5 {Not just mopping up an exposed pawn, White has now forked Bishop and Rook. 20...Re8 is the only option though White has plans after this. (21 Bg5 would prove most ugly for Black)} Nc6 {No need for those plans after all. Black, attempting to escalate again, fails to deal with a fork that even a newbie should've been able to mount the proper reply. } 21. Qxh8+ {From here Black's position is completely untenable, (if it wasn't already) it's really a case of how many moves White wishes to string this match out to. I asked Joe if he would learn anything from the crushing endgame, he said no and justly resigns. So much for bad and good bishops, btw, White's dcb hasn't moved a bit whilst Black's was a constant pain in its side. I would say, when reading any middle game text that begins harping on about bishops, to rip that chapter out. That note was included as I noticed Joe talking about this concept in my other annotation. Even Euwe mentions a bad bishop need not necessarily be bad and a good bishop necessarily good so why the hell bother labelling either bishop as such?   Anyway, the game was over and the war was won, solid play, knowledge of a familiar opening and a particular player's style was used to swiftly engineer a decisive victory. And, of course, the old fallacy of bringing the Q out too early again led to yet another budding chess player's downfall! :D I look forward to the rematch! :)   TJ Out. }
