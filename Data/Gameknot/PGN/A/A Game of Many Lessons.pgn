[Opening "Philidor (C41), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The Philodor's Defence. To be honest, 2...Nc6 is better than this move, but this is book without a doubt.} 3. Bc4 {I had no actual intention to play this move, but it resulted in the Philidor(C41), Steinitz Variation.} Nf6 {Analysis recommended 3...c6, but I still think that this move is no worry for Black.} 4. Nc3 {Or 4...d3 is just as good.} h6 {What is the goal of this move? I have no idea why this move was played.} 5. d4 {I rushed to gain central control.} c6 {Analysis advised that the move was played too late.} 6. d5 {I don't know why analysis considered this as a mistake, but this move works just as well in my opinion.} b5 7. Bb3 c5 {Good-bye Black's pawn structure! Enjoy your teacher.....the prowling c3 knight!} 8. Nxb5 Qa5+ {Lesson #1: Queens sometimes don't know how to fork pieces.} 9. Nc3 Ba6 10. Ba4+ {Lesson #2: Sneaky moves give you good luck.} Ke7 11. Bc6 Nxc6 12. dxc6 {Lesson #3: Beware of about-to-be passed pawns! Attack them at your own peril.} Nxe4 13. Bd2 Nf6 {Lesson #4: Don't be afraid to move your Queen somewhere else. Well, that's the end of my techer's lessons because the teacher did the teacher trap sac.} 14. Nd5+ Nxd5 15. Bxa5 Nf4 16. c7 {That moronic Bishop on a6 severely irritated me for the rest of the game!} Kd7 17. Nxe5+ Ke6 18. Nc6 Bb7 19. Nd8+ Kd7 20. Qg4+ {Better was 20.Nxb7 because it is now almost impossible to promote. This, however, is not the line of blunders.} Ne6 21. Nxf7 {I gave myself a pat on the back for a blunder well done.} Be7 {I wonder if Black thought that my knight was my Queen.} 22. Nxh8 Rxh8 {I guess that distracting the rook on move 22 was a complete failure to do anything. What was I thinking?!} 23. O-O {My last moves are about giving Black a lot of traps to trigger by bringing my rooks into the action.} Bf6 24. Rae1 Re8 {Mistake (I really don't know why, but analysis urged Black to play 24...Be5).} 25. Re3 {Mistake due to 25...Bd4.} Ba6 {Question #1: Did this move help you before, or did it help support me?} 26. Rfe1 Bd4 {Question #2: What would happen if Black was told that he was helping me out?} 27. Re3xe6 {Black resigned, for a good reason. if 27...Rxe6, then 28.Qxe6+ wins. Motto(s): When your pawn structure is used too many times in the beginning, it falls in the end, allowing opposing pieces to conquer the entire army without much trouble and pressure. Also, do not try to fall for unpinning traps like the one I used to capture Black's Queen. Last but not least, handle attacks with care, or you travel to Blunt Ave.}
