1. e4 {Hi everyone!  There seems to be quite a lot of interest in K & P endings lately, both in Ion's Mentoring Group I and in an unrated consultation game in a Club which Bigpeta is running, which I, Joanne Stevens and a few other sub-2000 players have been gathering ideas on how to deal with such endings.  Our opponent is Coach Ion!  So, I have just played out this ending against an Expert and come off worse and ended up getting a lesson in how not to play K & P endings.  The first lesson I was given was in this game, many years ago on gameknot: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/an-expert-lesson-in-how-to-play-k-amp-p-endings?gm=15275.  At least I did not have doubled pawns on one side of the board and a pawn minority on the other like I did in that game, but a really strange quirk led to Natalia crowning a pawn two moves before I did and eventually I copped Old Matey.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on ......} c5 2. f4 {2. f4 - Sicilian Grand Prix Attack!} Nf6 3. Nc3 {3. Nc3 - development.} d5 4. e5 d4 {4. ...... d4 - a counter-strike.  This move leads to a plethora of exchanges.} 5. exf6 dxc3 6. fxg7 cxd2+ 7. Qxd2 Qxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Bxg7 {8. ...... Bxg7 - suddenly a lot of wood has been shifted on the board and we are in the middlegame already.} 9. O-O-O Nc6 10. Bb5 {10. Bb5 - pin.} Bg4 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 {11. ..... bxc6 - black is left with doubled pawns after my trade off of Fou Leblanc for the knight.  Can I take advantage of this?  Only time will tell.} 12. Nf3 {12. Nf3 - walks into a pin but at least I clear the lines for my rooks.} O-O-O 13. Be3 {13. Be3 - well, not for want of trying, but .....} Bxf3 14. gxf3 {14. Bxf3 - ...... Firstly I am distracted by Natalia returning the compliment! } Bd4 {14. .... Bd4 - an offer of a bishop trade comes next.  I just cannot refuse it, can I, Ion?!} 15. Bxd4 Rxd4 16. Rxd4 cxd4 {16. ...... cxd4 - this plethora of exchanges results in Natalia undoubling her pawns.} 17. Rg1 {17. Rg1 - thought it would be a good idea to occupy the empty g file with a rook first.  After only 16 moves, Natalia and I have found ourselves in an endgame!} Kd7 18. Kd2 {18. Kd2 - out come the kings.  Unfortunately, Henry is one move behind his counterpart.  This is not good.  In an endgame, the king that comes to the centre first, after all other things being equal, usually wins the game.  Boy, this was certainly the case here!} Rb8 19. b3 Rb5 20. Rg5 {20. Rg5 - there seemed to be nothing better and if black takes, at least my pawns are undoubled.} Ke6 21. Kd3 Rxg5 22. fxg5 {22. fxg5 - Natalia has moved her king one square nearer to the kingside pawns before the rook exchange.  This move will prove decisive in Natalia's favour.} Kf5 23. Kxd4 {23. Kxd4 - counter-attack, but the problem is, there is the pawn on c6 and Henry must go on a journey to capture it.  In the meantime, my kingside pawns will fall and the e pawn will have a clear run.  So, down the chute does Jo go!} Kf4 24. Kc5 Kxf3 25. c4 e5 {25. ..... e5 - and here goes the e pawn!} 26. Kxc6 e4 27. c5 e3 28. Kb7 e2 29. c6 e1=Q {29. ..... e1/Q - Natalia crowns two moves before I do, I move the pawn up to the 7th rank but it goes no further.  Although this is an f pawn, the game is up for me because there are other pawns on the board and so the stalemate saviour is not available for me here, so it is a loss like any other pawn on the 7th rank v Q ending.  I did demonstrate how to go about winning that ending in the Ion v Bigpeta Students game and I will demonstrate it here again.} 30. c7 Qb4+ 31. Kxa7 {31. Kxa7 - might as well!} Qa5+ 32. Kb7 Qb5+ {32. ...... Qb5+ - the Wicked Witch of the West first gets closer to Henry in order to cramp him up a bit.} 33. Ka7 Qc6 34. Kb8 Qb6+ 35. Kc8 {35. Kc8 - Henry is forced to block in his bodyguard.  Now the BK comes in for the kill.} Kf4 36. Kd7 {36. Kd7} Qe6+ 37. Kd8 Qd6+ 38. Kc8 {38. Kc8 - again Henry must block and the BK moves ever closer.} Ke5 39. Kb7 Qb4+ 40. Kc8 Kd6 {40. ..... Kd6 - .... and closer.} 41. a4 {41. a4 - I could have resigned here but I decided to play it out to mate for demonstration purposes.} Qb6 42. Kd8 Qxc7+ {42. ...... Qxc7+ - tears!!!} 43. Ke8 Qe7# {43. ..... Qe7 MATE!! Here it is.  Notice that Natalia could have played the Witch to c8 and it would have also been mate with the BK blocking Henry off the second rank.  However, Henry must now suffer the kiss of death.  I just hope I can bring happier news to you all with my next game.  Until then, bye for now - Joanne.  }
