1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Another loss - sigh - I was unable to repeat my epic feat against Master Renniemay and add to my Master Draw tally.  Never mind, I have done it once and could do it again, that is my mantra.  Here I am faced with another Lopez and this time Maria puts her bishop on a4 instead of exchanging on c6.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 {4. ...... Nf6 - the Morphy Defense and the Main Line of the Ruy Lopez.} 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 {7. ...... d6 - still following the main line - note - I have learned my lesson not to play Na5?? at this juncture in order to exchange N for B as it drops the e5 pawn.} 8. c3 O-O 9. d4 Bg4 10. Be3 exd4 11. cxd4 {11. cxd4 - still in the main line - now a pawn trade.} Na5 12. Bc2 c5 13. h3 Bh5 14. Nbd2 cxd4 15. Bxd4 {15. Bxd4 - another pawn trade.} Nc6 16. Qb1 {16. Qb1 - Maria now takes me out of the book.  I decided to take on d4.  In retrospect, maybe I should have first taken on f3 before that exchange on d4.  At least I would not have had to contend with two horsies in my arc.  One horsie is a handful, two, well they are a double handful!} Nxd4 17. Nxd4 Rc8 {17. ...... Rc8 - I decided to nab the c file.} 18. a4 Qb6 {18. ...... Qb6 - trying to expand on the queenside but things are about to change.} 19. Nd2b3 Bg6 {19. ...... Bg6 - was bxa4 an improvement here?} 20. axb5 axb5 21. Bd3 {21. Bd3 - I expected a move like Ra4 here but this is also strong.} b4 22. Ra6 {22. Ra6 - nasty!} Qd8 23. Na5 d5 {23. ....... d5 - seemed a good idea at the time, but ....} 24. Nac6 Qe8 25. exd5 Bxd3 {25. ...... Bxd3 - this looked reasonable at the time .....} 26. Qxd3 Nxd5 {26. ...... Nxd5 - this did not look too bad, exchanged off white's dangerous lsb and got rid of my isolated d pawn and seemingly adequately defended Fou Lenoir, but .....} 27. Qb3 {27. Qb3! - this in between move kills my game stone dead!} Qd7 {27. .... Qd7 - I thought this move would hold things together, however ....} 28. Qxd5 {28. Qxd5!! - This move is really, really nasty and the end result will result in me being 6 points down on material with no counterplay against a Master with a rating of nearly 2300!  It was too much so I waved the white flag.  Can you the jury spot the sequence of moves that will lead to such a catastrophe for black?  Anyhow, I hope this will provide a useful lesson to the Coaching Club on tactics, of which I am still trying to improve mine by doing the puzzles - it could be a while - however before I feel the benefits of it, but I do have patience in abundance and the strength to persevere - cheers and bye for now - Joanne}
