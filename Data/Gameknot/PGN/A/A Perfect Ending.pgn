1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {A drawish variation.} 4. Nf3 Bd6 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. O-O O-O 7. c3 c6 8. Bg5 Bg4 {Both players are maintaining the symmetry...} 9. Nbd2 Nbd7 10. Qc2 Qc7 11. Rfe1 Rae8 {The game starts here... no more symmetry.} 12. Bh4 Bh5 13. Bg3 Bxg3 14. hxg3 Bg6 15. Rxe8 Rxe8 16. Bxg6 hxg6 17. Re1 a6 18. Qb1 Kf8 19. Rxe8+ Nxe8 20. a3 Qd8 21. Qe1 Qe7 22. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {No one would object if a draw was declared here. Yet Maroczy decides to play for the win. Through perfect technique, he'll get it.} 23. Kf1 Nd6 24. Ke2 f6 25. Ne1 b5 26. b4 {Marco's first mistake. Now the White QRP is weak and backwards.} Nb6 27. f3 Nbc4 28. Nb1 Nf5 29. g4 Nfe3 {White's position is not yet lost, but things look bad. Marco should play 30 P-N3!, followed up by 31 N-Q3.} 30. Kf2 g5 {Now White cannot play 31 N-Q3, as 31... N-B7! wins [32 N-B5 N/7xRP 33 NxN NxN 34 NxP N-N8! and White can resign.]} 31. Ke2 g6 32. Kf2 Kd6 33. Ke2 Kc7 34. Kf2 Kb6 {White is accomplishing nothing, while Black's King is moving steadily towards the action.} 35. Ke2 a5 36. Kf2 a4 37. Ke2 Kc7 38. Kf2 Kd6 39. Ke2 Ke7 40. Kf2 Kf7 41. Ke2 Kg7 {Now that Black has tied down White's Q-side, his K can wreak havoc on the K-side. And White has accomplished absolutely nothing with his last 10 moves.} 42. Kf2 Kh7 43. g3 {Way too late.} Kh6 44. Ke2 f5 45. gxf5 gxf5 46. Kf2 Kh5 47. Ke2 f4 {Black is slowly closing in for the kill.} 48. gxf4 gxf4 49. Kf2 Kg5 50. Ke2 Kh4 51. Kf2 Kh3 {White could resign now, but chooses to play on.} 52. Nd3 Nc2 53. Nxf4+ Kh4 54. Nd3 Nc2xa3 55. Nxa3 Nxa3 {Now the Black QRP is a distinct threat.} 56. Nc1 Nb1 57. Na2 {White's Knight is basically frozen in place.} Kh3 58. Ke3 Kg3 59. f4 Kg4 60. f5 Kxf5 {Now Black is ahead by a clear passed Pawn.} 61. Kd3 Kf4 62. Nc1 Kf3 63. Kc2 Na3+ 64. Kd3 Kf2 65. Kd2 Nc4+ 66. Kd1 Ke3 67. Kc2 a3 68. Na2 Nb2 69. Nc1 {White is holding on by his fingernails. Maroczy finishes brilliantly.} Nd3 {A beautiful sacrifice. If White plays NxN, 70... P-R7! wins. If White declines with 70 N-R2, Black has 70...K-K7!!! 71 K-N3 K-Q7 72 KxP K-B7!!! and wins.} 70. Nb3 Ne1+ 71. Kd1 Kd3 72. Kxe1 Kxc3 73. Na1 Kxd4 {White is dead in the water.} 74. Nc2+ Kc3 75. Kd1 a2 76. Kc1 d4 77. Na1 d3 78. Nb3 c5 {Marco resigns. The perfect ending indeed by Maroczy.}
