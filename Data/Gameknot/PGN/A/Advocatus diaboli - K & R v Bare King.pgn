1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I have another game to annotate.  This time it is a player who had a Class D rating but, after putting himself under the wing of Cyrano the Great, Overall Mentor of Group D, he has come on in leaps and bounds.  His name is Jellycake (John).  In this game he gave me a run for my money and material was even until the endgame, when he left a pawn en prise.  That was the only material he left en prise.  The rest of his game was absolutely solid.  Alas for John, that one little pawn proved decisive and he ended up sacrificing his rook to prevent Glenda from making an appearance.  However, K & R v Bare King was just the minimum amount of material I needed to force checkmate.  After careful analysis, I was able to demonstrate to John how this checkmate could be brought about.  John then resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  So, how did this come about?  Well, read on ........} c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {4. ...... a6 - allo, allo, allo - this is the Naijdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense (the Sicilian is characterised by 1. e4 c5).  It is very popular and Gary Kasparov virtually became World Champ after using this defense as black.} 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 {6. ...... bxc6 - John chooses to strengthen his centre.  On the minus side he leaves himself with an isolated pawn.  This will tell later on.} 7. Nc3 Bb7 8. O-O {8. 0-0 - both sides get their pieces out very quickly and now I decided to put Henry on the kingside.  Not the usual cut and thrust of the Dragon or Naijdorf when both sides attack each other's kings on opposite wings!} Bb4 9. Bd2 {9. Bd2 - to avoid BxN busting up my kingside pawns.} Nf6 10. e5 Nd5 11. Nxd5 Bxd2 12. Qxd2 cxd5 {12. ..... cxd5 - this plethora of exchanges leads to a doubleton on black's d column.  Is this an asset or a liability?  In this case, it will turn out to be the latter.} 13. Qb4 Rb8 14. Qa3 {14. Qa3 - Glenda prevents the BK from castling kingside.} Qe7 15. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {15. .... Kxe7 - queen trade.} 16. Rfe1 d6 17. exd6+ Kxd6 {17. .... Kxe6 - pawn trade.  This trade brings the BK out into the centre.  He is safe there as the queens are off the board and although both sides have their two rooks, there is only one set of minor pieces on the board, Fou Leblanc and his opposite number.} 18. Re3 Rba8 19. Rae1 Bc6 20. Bf1 {20. Bf1 - no real advantage here but an awful lot of scratching around by Yours Truly.} Rhb8 21. b3 Bb5 22. Bxb5 axb5 {22. ...... axb5 - this bishop trade leaves my a pawn vulnerable to castle fire.} 23. Ra1 d4 24. Rd3 {24. Rd3 - pin.} e5 25. c3 f6 {25. ..... f6? This loses a pawn due to the pin on the d4 pawn.} 26. cxd4 exd4 27. Rxd4+ Ke5 28. Rd7 {28. Rd7 - I am a pawn up, I attack black's kingside with a bone in the throat, but that is easy for John to defend.  Bit stuck here.} Rbg8 29. f3 Ke6 30. Rb7 {30. Rb7 - still scratching around!} Rab8 31. Rxb8 Rxb8 {31. ..... Rxb8 - one pair of rooks is traded off.  At least his remaining rook could be made passive provided that I can get Henry over to the queenside and relieve the rook of defending my own queenside pawns.  I just do not want Henry to be accosted by John's rook any more than I can help it.} 32. Kf2 h5 33. Ke2 g5 34. Rc1 {34. Rc1 - at least I can now take control of the c column and if John's rook attacks my a pawn, Rc2 will cut the mustard.} Kf5 35. Kd3 Rd8+ 36. Kc3 Rc8+ 37. Kb2 Rb8 {37. ..... Rb8 - John wisely eschews exchanging off his final rook as he will not want me to distract his king over to the queenside while Henry moves over to the kingside where three juicy p(r)awns await his consumption!} 38. Rc2 b4 39. a4 bxa3 e.p.+ 40. Kxa3 {40. Kxa3 - but as a result of this trade I do now have a passer and it is this pawn that will sound the death knell for the BK.} g4 41. fxg4+ hxg4 42. b4 {42. b4 - passed pawns must be pushed!} Ke4 43. Rc5 f5 44. g3 {44. g3 - in order to halt the advance of the f pawn.  If the f pawn does try to make progress, I will trade it off for my g pawn.  While Henry guards my a pawn, my rook will stop the BK from gloming my h pawn.} f4 45. gxf4 Kxf4 {45. ...... Kxf4 - the trade now takes place.} 46. b5 Kf3 47. Kb4 Kg2 48. Rh5 {48. Rh5 - as I said in my previous note, the situation has come to pass.  There is no way I will allow the BK to take my h pawn.  My rook's next plan is to shift up one rank to allow my passer to move to the 6th rank.} g3 49. hxg3 Kxg3 {49. ..... Kxg3 - the kingside pawns are finally traded off and there is just my b pawn left.  There is a real race against the clock.  Can I get my passer to safety before the rook and the BK get him?  We shall see!} 50. Rh6 Kg4 {50. ..... Kg4 - by staying on the g column, black loses a vital tempo.  On the next turn my pawn is just two squares from Glendadom.} 51. b6 Kg5 52. Rc6 Kf5 53. Kc5 {53. Kc5 - I think I am winning the race - just!  At least, unless I blunder my rook, John cannot win.  I certainly want to avoid conceding a Low Draw though!} Ke5 54. Rc7 Ke6 55. b7 {55. b7 - Henry will move to c6 next move, shutting out the BK and I will then move my rook to c8 forcing John to allow Glenda to return to the board with a vengeance.  However .......} Rxb7 {55. ...... Rxb7 - ..... he sacs his rook for the pawn!  Unfortunately for John, it is still a loser, although it will take a lot longer to deliver the coup de grace.  John wanted to play on because he was curious to see just how mate could be forced by Henry and the rook.  We played it out a few more moves, then ......} 56. Rxb7 Kf6 57. Kd5 {57. Kd5 - keeping John's king confined to the f column, wait for it ......} Kf5 58. Rf7+ {58. Rf7+ - forcing John's king back to the g column, wait for it .....} Kg6 59. Ke6 Kg5 60. Rf8 Kg4 61. Ke5 {61. Ke5 - NOW!!  Here, after some very careful analysis I announced #13.  Here is the mate but if you can find a quicker one please do not hesitate to provide me with answers on a postcard.  Variation A 61. … Kg3 62. Ke4 Kg2 63. Ke3 Kg1 64. Ke2 Kg2 65. Rg8+ Kh3 66. Kf2 Kh4 67. Kf3 Kh5 68. Kf4 Kh6 69. Kf5 Kh7 70. Rg1 Kh6 71. Rg2 Kh7 72. Kf6 Kh8 73. Kf7 Kh7 74. Rh2# Variation B 61. … Kg3 62. Ke4 Kg2 63. Ke3 Kg1 64. Ke2 Kg2 65. Rg8+ Kh2 66. Kf3 Kh1 67. Kf2 Kh2 68. Rh8# Variation C: 61. … Kg3 62. Ke4 Kg2 63. Ke3 Kg1 64. Ke2 Kg2 65. Rg8+ Kh1 66. Kf2 Kh2 67. Rh8#.  John agreed with the announcement and resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  I may get an even tougher game in my return match against him.  His rating has been coming on in leaps and bounds and only just recently, John overwhelmed a Class C 1500+ player in an endgame.  It will be interesting to see how he gets on against the Master Mater.  Anyhow, I hope you have all had a good read.  Kind regards - Joanne}
