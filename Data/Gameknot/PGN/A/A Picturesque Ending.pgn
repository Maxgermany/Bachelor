[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence, Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 {Aha, someone challenged me on the Fast Ladder. I accept! (hah, like the Ladder rules give me a choice). 1. e4, as usual.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {My beloved Ruy, a favorite of most all players who love to attack.} d6 4. d4 {Black chooses the Old Steinitz Defense, good if you like cramped games. While it's mostly sound, it's not the most dynamic of black's options. I play the main line.} Bd7 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Bxc6 {Black seems to have abandoned his e5 pawn to overwhelming force.} Bxc6 7. dxe5 {Now I'm expecting 7. ... dxe5 8. Nxe5 Qxd1+ 9. Kxd1 and white is a pawn ahead.} Nh6 8. h3 {Black took me a bit by surprise with 7. ... Nh6?!, a dubious move that traps his knight on the edge of the board. 8. h3 serves to insure the knight remains trapped, though in retrospect I should have just saved time and taken it. White is ahead by a pawn and going to stay that way, so trading pieces is sensible, as is doubling and isolating black's pawns, ruining his entire kingside.} f5 9. Bxh6 {Done.} gxh6 10. Nd5 {Hunting more exchanges. I had to analyze this one out quite a bit, as it seems to give up the e4 pawn, returning all of black's material deficit and restoring part of his pawn structure.} fxe4 11. Nxe7 {Weeee! Let's exchange stuff!} Qxe7 12. exd6 cxd6 13. Nd4 {Maybe more exchanges.} e3 14. Qh5+ {Black is definitely bold. Advancing that intrepid pawn into the very heart of the enemy camp. However, it seems to have misstepped. Too far from home, too little support. The move does discover an attack by black's bishop against the white pawn on g2. I was tempted to simply castle and see if I could get a rook onto the e-file to skewer the black queen to her king, but I expected black would castle out of it long before I could, so I simply invited black to forever give up his option to castle.} Kd8 15. O-O {Time to get off of the dangerous file.} exf2+ 16. Rxf2 {Somehow in all of that, I gave up a pawn (10. ... fxe4) which I considered to be a gambit to facilitate white's development and position. Actually, I thought at the time that I would win it back easily, too. But now material is even. Position, however, is not. Black's pawns are still in ruins - in fact white can simply snatch up h6 and regain his material lead. Even better, white has a rook on an open file and is better poised for an attack.} Rg8 17. Qa5+ {Still thinking of a skewer. Oh how easily black might get careless and think he could safely play 17. ... Ke8? planning to answer 18. Re1 with 18. ... Qxe1+. That backward defense of e1 from all the way over on a5 has been overlooked before. Of course, white would only win black's bishop after 18. ... Be5, but it would still be nice. Note that 17. ... b6? loses a piece to 18. ... Nxc6+.} Kc8 18. Re1 {Well, it won't win black's bishop, but it's still development with tempo.} Qg5 19. Nxc6 bxc6 20. Qa6+ {As it stands, material is still quite even, though white is about to win a pawn. 20. Qxg5?? would be a mistake, maybe even a ?? mistake. Not only would white lose a simple opportunity to gain a pawn and a winning endgame, but he would undouble black's kingside. The resultant endgame would be very drawish. Can't have that. Note that here black cannot play 20. ... Kd7??? or 20. ... Kc7??? as white wins immediately with 21. Rf7+ Kd8 22. Qxc6 threatening mate on c7 and d7 - black cannot stop both mates.} Kb8 21. Qxc6 {Pawn gained. Should be smooth sailing from here. Black's pawns are a mess and white has the material lead. Further, black's queen's rook is trapped and useless, so white is, for the moment, effectively a rook ahead. Best, white still threatens 22. Rf7 leading to all kinds of mates. Black has only one move to prevent those mates and save his central pawn.} Qc5 22. Qxc5 dxc5 23. Rf7 {Black found the move, but now with queens off the board and his rooks trapped in the corners, white's rooks become juggernauts.} Rh8 24. Ree7 h5 25. Reb7+ Kc8 26. Rfc7+ {The plan is to get rid of black's most dangerous pawn (none are really that dangerous, but the pawns on the edge are definitely going nowhere). It also is the fastest way for white to get a passed pawn.} Kd8 27. Rxc5 h6 28. Rcc7 Ke8 29. Rce7+ {White loses focus here a little. I had thought maybe black would run to f8, allowing the white king to come out and play without being checked. Much better would be to simply eliminate the pawn on a8 and then steamroll the queenside pawns.} Kd8 30. Rbxa7 {Back on track.} Rxa7 31. Rxa7 {Black exchanges rooks. All four of them. Doubious play, but he had little better. Any attempt to bring his rook to b8 or c8 is only an illusion of a threat against white's pawns. A little rook maneuvering by white and black will be checkmated if he captures a pawn: 30. ... Rc8 31. Red7+! Ke8 32. Rac7 Ra8 33. Rg7 Rxa2??? 34. Rc8#.} Re8 32. Ra8+ {Excanging the remaining rooks.} Ke7 33. Rxe8+ Kxe8 34. Kf2 {Waste of a move. I thought the bringing up the king was the solution, but after I submitted this move, I re-evaluated the pawn advance as being more direct.} h4 35. a4 {And now for a pretty little pawn charge, all in formation. Mostly.} Kd7 36. a5 Kc7 37. b4 Kb7 38. b5 {There is no defense, really.} Ka7 39. a6 Kb8 40. b6 Ka8 41. c4 {Bringing up the rest of the formation.} Kb8 42. c5 Ka8 43. c6 h5 44. Ke3 {Black played for a stalemate. 44. a7??? or 44. c7??? would have given it to him. 44. b7 wins for white, but needs the king's assistance. Instead, white simply nudges his king toward the center, but 44. Kg1 would have been equally effective - white just needs to discard a tempo. We had played the last 6 or 7 moves quickly, like an OTB game with time dwindling, but here black waited a while. A couple hours or so. During that time, I announced mate in 6 and set up all the conditional moves. Black was kind enough to endulge me by playing out the checkmate.} Kb8 45. a7+ Ka8 46. c7 {45. ... Ka8 was forced as the alternative, 45. ... Kc8 loses instantly to 46. a8=Q#.} Kb7 47. a8=Q+ {The queen is en prise but untouchable. 47. ... Kxa8 is met with 48. c8=Q#. Blacks best response is 47. ... Kxb6. Sad when taking a pawn is better than taking a queen, although in this case, "better" only means being mated in three moves rather than one.} Kxb6 48. c8=Q {Two out of three isn't bad...} Kb5 49. Qab7+ Ka4 50. Qca8# {Final position. Fairly well played by my opponent. I have no tragic flaws to point out. A couple weak moves in the opening, giving up the pawn on e5 then allowing his kingside pawns to be ruined with 9. Bxh6 proved to be a part of his undoing, though those were relatively minor blunders as far as blunders go. After that, black did nothing overtly wrong. White pressed his positional advantage and ultimately converted it to a material advantage and a won endgame. Overall, a good game with a rather picturesque ending.}
