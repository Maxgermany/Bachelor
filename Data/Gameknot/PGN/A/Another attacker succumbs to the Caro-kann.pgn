[Opening "Caro-Kann (B13), Panov-Botvinnik, Herzog defence"]

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 {The caro-kann exchange varation where white does not allow black to setup his poweful f7-b7 trianlge pawn structure. } cxd5 {The negative result of the exchange for black is that now he has a big weakness on c6 and light sqaures on the queen side.} 4. c4 {Caro-kann Panov attack. White immedaitely attack's black's center not allowing him to develop in peace. The price white pays however is he gets saddled with an isoalted d pawn. } Nf6 {Defending the d pawn and developing the knight to it's normal position. In the caro-kann black must defend and retain d5. Under no circumstances can black just allow white to claim d5. The other square of critical importance to black is e5. If black wants to survive then he must match white strength vs strength on e5. } 5. Nc3 {White increases his pressure on d5 } Nc6 {Black does not play play ...e6 transposing into a Queen's Gambit decline position with a slight  lose of tempo or the relatively untested ...g6. } 6. Bg5 {White continues his quest to undermine d5. } dxc4 {However, black exchanges the pawns before white can capture it and at the same time saddles white with a isolated d pawn. Take note of this because the isolated d pawn becomes the centre of attention in the future. On a side note I do not fear 7. Bxf6 exf6 8. d5 Ne5 9. Bxc4 Nxc4 10. Qa4+ Bd7 11. Qxc4 Rc8 gives black excellent chances. } 7. Bxc4 h6 8. Be3 {Most likely best since 8. Bxf6 exf6 9. Nf3 Bd6 10. 0-0 0-0 11. h3 Bf5 transpose into well known draw lines of the Kornchoni defence. However, if you do not like Be3 8. Bf4 is a strong alternative. } e6 {prevents white from using the d5 square for the time being. Plus it creates a potiental outpost on d5} 9. Nf3 {White threatens to gain control of the critical e5 square so black must respond to this} Bd6 {preventing the immedaitely Ne5 or Bf5. One of the great features of the caro-kann is its simple way to defending. Notice how I am not overly aggressive, I am simply responding to my opponents threats (in this case threat of Ne5).} 10. O-O O-O {Again nothing fancy just responding with solid noncommittal moves. } 11. Nb5 {!? This is exactly the type of overly agressive move that black is hoping for just watch how white leterally beats himself up trying to get through black's wall. My guess is that white is fighting for control of e5 by threatening to remove the DSB. However, it back fires since 12. Nxd6 Qxd6 gives black complete control of d5 and attacking chances on d4. White's best chances lay on the c file with 11. Rc1 which x-rays the weak c6 point and prevents black from developing his bishop on the power b7-g2 diagonal. A more sublte and positional apporach is 11. h3 preventing Ng4 with an attack on d4. } b6 {A very smart move that takes full advantage of white's tempo wasting 10. Nb5. By playing ...b6 Black adds more control of d5 and develops the LSB to a very powerful diagonal.  } 12. Nxd6 Qxd6 {By this point I was feeling very secure because all of white's main threat can be easily met. For example, both Rc1 and h3 are met with Bb7 and the combination of Qd2 and Bf4 are met with...} 13. Qd2 {preparing to play Bf4. } Rd8 {I like this move because it put the rook on the same file as the enemy queen  and gives f8 as an escape square for the queen in the event of Bf4} 14. Rac1 Bb7 {I looked at 14. ...Nd5 but did not like the fact that it weakens the pressure on d4. Besides it is overly agressive and not very caro-kann like!} 15. Bf4 {I can no longer hold the tide on e5 so I must retreat. } Qf8 {This is the most secure square since Qd7 takes away an escape square from the knight in the event of Bb5. and Qe7 is just asking for Ne5. My theory is why give your opponent something to shoot at!} 16. Bb5 {Now Bb5 is played to drive away the knight from the defence of e5 giving white access to e5 and the open c-file. However, it increases black's control of d5 and awakens the slumbering gaint on b7. All of these things are not very good for white so a more tempered approach is needed. Here 16. Rfd1 is very solid for white. Truth be told I was predicting 16. Rfd1 and planning to meet it with Ne7 } Ne7 17. Be2 Rac8 {Challenging white's control for the c-file. } 18. Ne5 {White finally achieves securing the nice outpost for his knight. But it removes a defender from d4 so Black can now initiate an attack on it. } Nf5 {!! This essentailly forces white to give up control of the c-file(only real asset) in order to prevent the fall of d4. } 19. Rxc8 {forced} Rxc8 {White manages to save d4 by deflecting the rook off of the d file. } 20. g4 {This is a good because it drives back the knight from f5 However it creates a serious weakness on the light squares which black can try to exploit. } Ne7 {20....Ne4 21. Qd3 Ne7 22. Bf3 allows white to improve upon his LSB. } 21. f3 {preventing ...Ne4 and Nxg4 but now white's kingside has serious holes. } Ned5 22. Bg3 Qe8 {The threat is to invade white's space with ...Qa4 followed by Qc2. } 23. a3 {way too passive best was Nc4 and black can not make anything good happen via  23. Nc4! Qa4 24. b3 Qb4 25. Qxb4 Nxb4 and the game is a draw. } Qa4 24. Qd3 Qc2 {and the battle for the 2nd rank begins. } 25. Rb1 {Forced} Ne3 {!! This is the killer because it ensures domination on white's second rank and drives a huge wedge into white's position. This effectively gives white no room to make a mistake. } 26. Re1 {?? and here it is. It often happens that if you can force your attacker opponent into defence they will often do something desperate to get an attack going. What I think happened was the my opponent forgot why he had moved his rook to b1. I think white's best hope to hold is 26. Bf2(challenging the knight) Nfd5 27. Qxc2 Rxc2 28. Bd3} Nfd5 {Now the knight on d3 is well defended and b1 is a sitting duck.} 27. Qb5 {White tries to actively defend b2 but now the linch pin of his whole defence falls} Qd2 {!! it is all over except for the fat lady singing} 28. Rb1 f6 {!! This is the strongest way to win. Not 28. ...Qxd4 29. Qd3! Nc2 30. Qxd4 Nxd4 and white has gotten the most from a very bad situation. } 29. Ng6 Kf7 30. Nh4 {Now all the key caro-kann squares are firmly in black control e5 and d5.} Rc2 {Why capture a pawn when there is a bishop for sale! } 31. Qd7+ Ne7 32. Qxb7 Qxe2 33. Re1 Qd2 {I theaten ...G5 with my next move deflecting the only defender of g2 and check mate.} 34. f4 g5 {As with all decisive attacks it can not be prevented. } 35. Qe4 {and white resigns. please give feedback}
