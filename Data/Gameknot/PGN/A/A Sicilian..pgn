1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {This is one of my First games, so I decided to mix it up.} Nf6 3. d3 d6 4. b3 {In retrospect, not a good move.} e5 {We've both been just messing with our pawns up till now, but Black's move here makes little sense to me, maybe he is clearing the way to castle, but why?} 5. h4 Be7 6. f3 O-O {Castling like this only stuck his king in the corner, as Black's rook can't get anywhere for some turns. I decide to pawn-storm the king's side, because Black is cramped. Whatever he is doing, I've got plenty of tempo.} 7. g4 Nc6 8. h5 a6 {The threat of b4 is not preventable. I'll focus on the king side some more, taking the tempo from Black's queen side attack.} 9. Qd2 {(?)GK Analysis says this is where I'm in the wort position, I'm down 2.72 points. } b5 {This wins him the bishop, but I got the tempo I needed. } 10. h6 {(?)Black gets impatient, and Ignores the very advanced pawn. GK Analysis says were very close now.} bxc4 11. hxg7 {At this point, my pawn storms the castle, and I use him as a ladder.} Re8 {(?) better would be Qa5, pinning or trading my queen as Black has the advantage. } 12. Qh6 Nb4 {(?)Black decides to attack, now that my queen is out. I think Bf8 would be smarter, trading a bishop for a passed pawn on the 7th rank. GK says Nd4 is optimal, 13. g5 Nf5 14. exf5 Bxf5 15. dxc4 Nd7 16. Rh2 Qa5+ 17. Bd2 Qc7  would result. } 13. Kd1 Rf8 {(?)Black has fed another tempo into my storm, and seals his fate. } 14. g5 {(!)At this point, My pawn attacks Black's knight, opening up Qxh7mate. I never knew doubled pawns could be so powerful. The lesson? Never play passively, and don't castle just to castle. }
