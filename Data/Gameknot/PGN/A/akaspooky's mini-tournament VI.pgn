[Opening "Philidor (C41), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {The Steinitz Variation of the Philidor Defence.  White has an early lead in piece development and is looking to put pressure on the Black kingside. } h6 {? Will eventually take g5 away from the White dsb, but it does nothin to aid Black's development and is really just a waste of time. } 4. d3 {The computer analysis prefers 4. d4.  I wanted to avoid an early fight over d4.  A line like 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 is probably fine for White, who maintains two centrally-developed pieces to Black's none.  In general, I would venture that when your opponent wastes a tempo you should be more willing than usual to seek out an open game to exploit the waste of time.} Nc6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. O-O {White's dsb is the only undeveloped piece, and has nowhere particularly helpful to go , a problem that could have been avoided by 4. d4.  } Bg4 7. Be3 Be7 {Both sides now look to have almost finished developing, although Black still needs to castle.  Neither player looks to have a particularly well-placed dsb, although Black's might be easier to free as it is his own men causing the problem, whereas White's is constrained by the Black pawns.  An alternative development plan for White could have involved Nbd2, b3 and Bb2, preparing d4 and a slightly better coordinated position in exchange for an uncastled king (although it's unpressured) } 8. h3 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 {Black trades his lsb off for a White knight rather than give up his advanced bishop.  8. ... Bh5 looks like a good option to maintain the pin and the tension since White can't really follow it with g4 without a horrible weakening of the kingside pawn cover and will struggle to protect the knight with something other than the g-pawn. } Na5 {Having just given up the bishop pair, Black immediately moves to deprive White of the same. } 10. b4 {? The White bishop does lack retreat squares.  Bxf7 is a tempting but probably unsound sacrificial attack that leaves the Black king in the centre (this would be even more tempting in the more open game starting from 4. d4 discussed earlier).  Bd5 looks best, continuing Nxd4 11. Nxd5, and if Black plays 11. ... c6 to push the knight back, 12. Nc3 is fine and Black must spot the threat of b4 on his knight or lose it, although if he does spot it, 12. ... b5 looks reasonably good for Black.  10. b4 just doesn't do very much.  If White is resigned to losing the bishop on its current square, b3 might be better, allowing White to recapture with the b-pawn and keep the d-pawn for opening up the central files. } Nxc4 11. dxc4 O-O {This position looks quite flat and placcid.  White has the half-open d-file to work with, but his queenside pawns look messy and his knight on that side of the board looks weak.  Black has very limited activity but compensates with a lack of defensive weakenesses. } 12. Qg3 {Attempts to start an attack on the king and threatens Bxh6.  Also allows the queen to line up on the e5 pawn, which can be undermined by White playing c5, opening up the centre for White's queen to dominate. } Kh8 {Spots the tactical danger and moves away. } 13. f3 {? 13. f4 might have worked to attack the e5 pawn and bring the f1 rook into the battle.  c5 is also tempting, as above.  13. f3 just doesn't do or threaten to do anything except open up potential dark-square lines on the king. } Qd7 {Allows the queen to start moving into the fight.  I also like 13. ... c5 to open up a dark-square diagonal to allow the queen to attack the White queenside pawns. } 14. Nd5 {Trading off the knights allows the White pawns to undouble and establishes a potentially troublesome advanced pawn wedge, while also locking the d6-pawn down.  Not trading the knights either ties the Black queen to the bishop or forces it to move back. } Nh5 {? A bad move.  Allows White to play Qg4, which attacks both the Black queen and knight, and allows an eventual material edge for White, who finishes the sequence (15. Qg4 Qxg4 16. fxg4 Ng3 17. Nxe7 Nxf1 18. Rxf1) with a small advantage. } 15. Qf2 {? However, your mistakes are only as bad as your opponents exploitations of them (or something like that).  This can only be a badly-considered move, attempting to keep the queen.} c6 16. Nxe7 Qxe7 {White trades his knight for Black's bishop, alleviating the weakness of his king's dark squares, and should now look to create a position in which his long-range bishop can dominate Black's short-range knight.  He can do this by encouraging action on both wings, or just the queenside if he can act quickly.} 17. c3 b6 18. a4 {These queenside pawn advances are also a way for White's bishop, which can reach them, to have power over the knight, who is stuck on the other side of the world. } Rfc8 19. Ra2 {?! Not necessarily a bad move, but I can't really see what it acheives or is trying to acheive.  It will eventually allow the rooks to double along a file.  The mirroring Rfc1 might have been better.} c5 20. Rc2 {White plays this because without it he fears 20. ... cxb4 21. cxb4 Rxb4, allowing Black to establish a rook in his territory and dropping a pawn.  Instead, the more active counter 20. a5 allows White to really use the bishop's power to threaten with an advanced pawn.} Qe6 21. Qh4 Nf4 {Black avoids having his queen tied to the knight by offering to give it up. White might be well advised not to accept, as the bishop is more useful.} 22. Bxf4 {But White does accept.} exf4 23. Rff2 {? Another White move that doesn't do much.  I think White fears Black playing Qxc4 and cxb4, with the c-pawn pinned, but Rff2 doesn't really help that since Black can trade his queen for two rooks and give White a difficult time.  Or he can just win the b-pawn after 23. ... Qxc4 24. Qxf4 cxb4 25. cxb4 Qxb4.  23. Rfc1 was a better move, with the dangerous doubling that actually prevents the above pawn-winning line, or the immedite Qxf4. } cxb4 24. cxb4 Rxc4 {And White drops a pawn, and allows a dangerously advanced Black rook (the position of the pawns on the White queenside makes a rook on the fifth similar to a rook on the seventh in other circumstances). } 25. Qxf4 Rxc2 {Black takes a trade of rooks, rather than a free pawn.  Why is something of a mystery. } 26. Rxc2 Kg8 27. Rc6 {White now establishes a forward rook of his own, and threatens to overwork the Black queen for the isolated d-pawn. } Rd8 28. Rc7 a5 {Black counters White's threat to his pawn by advancing it. } 29. b5 {Better was 29. bxa5 bxa5 30. Qd2, with the White queen threatening both isolated Black pawns. } Rc8 {Black offers a trade of rooks, with the resulting loss of his d-pawn.  } 30. Rxc8+ {The computer prefers Rc6 with a resulting queen trade and White winning the pawn, leading to a rook and pawns, instead of queen and pawns, endgame, but the evaluations aren't that different (+1.7 vs. +2) } Qxc8 31. Qxd6 Qb7 {The Black queen is stuck defending the b-pawn against the White queen, which might allow the White king and 4 to make advances on the other side against the Black king and 3, with the White queen having the initiative available to make the decisive first blow. } 32. Kf2 g6 33. g4 Kg7 34. f4 {?? White's latest blunder throws away the win.  Best was 34. e5 , using the queen to push the Black king into the corner, winning Black's f-pawn and advancing the e-pawn under queen escort. } Qxe4 {Naturally, Black seizes his opportunity to put a big hole in the White plan.  } 35. Qe5+ Qxe5 36. fxe5 f6 37. exf6+ {The Black king is inside the square of the e-pawn, so there's no point White trying to push it - it can't promote and, in this position, won't buy enough time for White's king to activate itself properly.  White therefore chooses to simplify and solidify the draw. } Kxf6 38. Ke3 Ke5 {There's no way for either side to make progress.  White would have had some winning chances after other king moves, but as it is both sides are locked down and so a draw results.}
