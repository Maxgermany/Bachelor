1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I am playing in a King's Pawn mini-tournament.  The moves e4 and e5 were played out for me.  I ended up facing a King's Gambit and I accepted it.  I managed to retain my pawn plus all the way through.  I tried to attack my opponent but got to a dead end.  In the end I decided to play into a repetition and claim a High Draw.} e5 2. f4 {2. f4 - this move characterises the King's Gambit.  It is done to lure my pawn away from the centre and build up an attack on the black king.   Yup, Henry must certainly watch for activity on the kingside columns.} exf4 {2. ........ exf4 - accepted.} 3. Bc4 {3. Bc4 - this move, aiming for quick development is called the King Bishop's gambit.  I play the quiet and conservative Nf6.} Nf6 4. Nc3 {4. Nc3 - white brings out a knight and I bring out my other knight to catch up with development.} Nc6 5. d4 Bb4 6. Qd3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 {7. bxc3 - B for N trade busting white's queenside pawns.} d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 {8. ......... Nxd5 - pawn trade.} 9. Qe4+ Be6 {9. ......... Be6 - that check from the Wicked Witch of the West looked very nasty, but it is not as bad as it looks.  If BxN then Glenda my Good Witch of the North recaptures, giving white the option of trading queens.} 10. Ne2 {10. Ne2 - development.} O-O 11. O-O {11. 0-0 - both sides castle and now comes a little tactical melee which will result in a trade off of my advanced f pawn for the advanced white doubleton on the c column maintaining my 1 pawn advantage.} Nxc3 12. Nxc3 Bxc4 13. Rd1 {13. Rd1 - sidestepping Fou Leblanc.  Now I play Re8 to centralise and menace the Wicked Witch.} Re8 14. Qxf4 Ba6 {14. ...... Ba6 - defending the b pawn and also attacking the f1 square preventing white from putting a rook on it.} 15. Be3 Nb4 16. Rd2 c6 17. a3 Nd5 18. Nxd5 Qxd5 {18. ........ Qxd5 - after a bit of manouevering with my knight I find myself with a choice of recaptures.  Q or c pawn.  Glenda of course must recapture as she is as well centralised as the Witch and eyeing up the square g2.  There is no lsb to divert her from that square.  It will take several moves to dislodge her.} 19. Qg3 Re6 {19. Re6 - rook lift.} 20. Bf2 Rg6 {20. ....... Rg6 - pins Glenda against Qg2#.} 21. Qh3 Rh6 22. Qg3 Rg6 {22. ...... Rg6 - here we agree a draw.  You the jury may think that I should break the repetition.  Do bear in mind that if the heavies were swapped off it will be white's dsb against Fou Leblanc and we know what that means!  I also have to watch out on the back rank.  So, not a bad result against a 1800+ player.}
