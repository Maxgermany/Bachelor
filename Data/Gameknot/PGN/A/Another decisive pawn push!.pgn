1. d4 {Hi everyone!  So, I see you enjoyed that game where I gave my Class C opponent a hard time with a central pawn push.  In this game (which began with a Queen Pawn Opening) against a Class A 1800+ opponent, it was one passer on one side and two connected pawns on the other in a rook and pawn ending.  Although the connected pawns were on the kingside, they were not passed.  However, my decoy pawn enticed the rooks to be swapped off and my kingside pawn majority proved decisive.  Glenda's arrival heralded victory for Yours Truly.

Nf3 {4. Nf3 - white decides to develop his king knight before winning back his c pawn.} e6 5. Bxc4 {5. Bxc4 - but now he does.} c5 6. O-O a6 {6. ..... a6 - preparing a possible b5.} 7. a4 Nc6 8. Qe2 cxd4 9. Rd1 {9. Rd1 - pin.} Be7 10. exd4 O-O {10. .... 0-0 and now Henry tucks himself away on the kingside.} 11. Nc3 Nd5 12. Bb3 Ncb4 {12. ...... Ncb4 - trying to improve the position of my knights.} 13. Ne5 Bd7 14. Qg4 {14. Qg4 - ssss, here comes the Wicked Witch of the West and she is bearing down on Henry!} Nf6 15. Qg3 {15. Qg3 - the Witch Ejection Plan only partially works as she still stays on that g file and while she stays there there is the possibility of Bh6 putting Henry in Old Matey's Shadow.} Bc6 16. Bh6 Ne8 {16. ..... Ne8 - my knight retreats to a poor square to ensure that Henry does not cop Old Matey on g7.} 17. Nxc6 bxc6 {17. ..... bxc6 - pawn trade.} 18. Bf4 a5 19. Be5 {19. Be5 - renewing the pressure on g7.} Qb6 20. Rac1 Nd5 21. Nxd5 exd5 {21. ..... exd5 - pawn trade.} 22. Rc2 Bf6 23. Rdc1 Bxe5 24. dxe5 {24. dxe5 - bishop trade.} Rb8 {24. .... Rb8 - it looks as if I am gonna drop my c6 pawn here.  I must therefore rustle up some counterplay pronto.  Firstly I pile up on white's lsb on b3.} 25. Ba2 Qb4 {25. ..... qb4 - Glenda puts the a5 pawn under the hammer.} 26. Rc2xc6 Qxb2 27. Bxd5 {27. Bxd5 - so I lose a pawn after all but I am in no mood to throw in the sponge.  Time to shake off this passivitis - Joanne and get a few threats in to keep your opponent busy at the least!} Rb4 28. e6 fxe6 29. Bxe6+ Kh8 {29. ..... Kh8 - I think I will regain my pawn deficit but Henry is forced onto h8 and is therefore more susceptible to catching Old Matey on the back row.} 30. h4 Rxa4 {30. .... Rxa4 - after white decided to give his own king some luft I decided to regain my pawn.  I now have a passer on a4.} 31. Rc6c2 Qf6 32. Bd7 Rxh4 {32. ..... Rxh4 - pawn grab, hope I do not regret it, only time will tell.} 33. Bxe8 Qh6 {33. .... Qh6! - I was soo tempted to play RxB here but I was worried about Henry on the back row.  Now, incredibly, it is white's king's turn to feel icy cold and see a dark, dark shadow, directly overhead.  It looks as though, if he plays f4 to avoid copping Old Matey on h1, he will lose his rook on c1 to RxR+, RxR, QxR.  But white keeps the deficit down to a mere two pawns.} 34. Bh5 Rxh5 35. f4 Rh1+ 36. Kf2 Rxc1 {36. ..... Rxc1 - although this does not now result in the win of a rook I can now simplify down to a rook ending two pawns up.  This will prove decisive in my favour, never fear!} 37. Rxc1 Qxf4+ 38. Qxf4 Rxf4+ 39. Ke3 {39. Ke3 - although it is Henry's turn to shiver on h8, white has no time to send Old Matey down to c8 because his king is in check.  However, now that the WK has moved out of it, my rook must go back to f8 to prevent this calamity.} Rf8 40. Kd4 Kg8 {40. .... Kg8 - Henry decided to get the Old Matey monkey off his back by moving towards the centre.  Incredibly, Henry will stay rooted to this square for the rest of the game and merely watch procedings on both sides of the board.} 41. Rc7 {41. Rc7 - to keep Henry pinned to the back row.} Ra8 42. Kc3 a4 43. Kb2 a3+ 44. Ka2 {44. Ka2 - the WK blockades my passer on a3, but where there's a will, there's a way!} h6 45. Rc3 h5 46. Rxa3 Rxa3+ 47. Kxa3 {47. Kxa3 - I am not too upset at the fact that my a pawn has dropped because the rooks are off the board and my kingside pawn majority will prove decisive as you will now see.} g5 48. Kb3 h4 49. Kc3 {49. Kc3 - the WK tries to stop the black pawns from reaching Glendadom but it will be to no avail.} g4 50. Kd3 h3 51. gxh3 gxh3 {51. ..... gxh3 - under a set of conditional moves a decisive pawn trade takes place.  Only one dear little pawn is left on the board, so why should white resign two moves down the line?} 52. Ke2 h2 53. Kf2 h1=Q {53. ..... h1/Q - well, you see, on h1 there is now a big, black queen, her name is Glenda and she is loaded with 9 units of checkmate!  So that is why white waves that white flag!  As both Henry and Glenda have shared an intimate dinner for two of garlic prawn vindaloo to celebrate their tearful reunion, her breath and tongue will smell and taste particularly unpleasant to the WK so I do not blame Etienne for trying to avoid this.  Now, how will she force mate from here?  Well, here is a sample line. 54.  Ke3  Qd5    55.  Kf4  Kf7    56.  Ke3  Kf6 (Henry starts moving in for the kill)    57.  Kf4  Qe5+ (forcing the WK back)    58.  Kf3  Kf5    59.  Kg2  Qe3 (Glenda forces the WK to the first rank or file by moving a knight's move away from the WK)    60.  Kh2  Qg5 (Glenda does not wish to allow the wrong kind of mate so she allows the WK some freedom until her better half moves in ever closer!)    61.  Kh3  Kf4    62.  Kh2  Kf3 (now the WK is either forced to h1 or opposite Henry which will enable Glenda to give the WK the kiss of death)    63.  Kh3  Qg3# (here it is, Glenda now French kisses the WK, euuuuw, and he now falls to the ground - aaargh!)  Hope you have had a good read and soon I will have another annotation for you.  Anyhow, I hope you are all enjoying your weekend - bye for now - Joanne}
