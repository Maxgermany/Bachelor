[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B05), modern, Flohr variation"]

1. e4 {When in doubt, always play 1. e4...  Bobby Fischer could have quoted that, and maybe he did...  } Nf6 {Alekhine defense, a strong drawing weapon in the right hands... But then again: no one ever won against me - nor Bobby Fischer - with this...  } 2. e5 {Pure out of principle: white, as well as black will lose tempo over this...  In blitz, I mostly play 2. d4!? Nxe4 3. Nd2 d5 4. Bd3 Nxd2 5. Qxd2 Nc6 6. Nf3 Qd6 (Bg4, Ne5) 7. 0-0, and gain much in development... } Nd5 {Of course 2. ... Ne4 3. d3 Nc5 4. d4, is no serious option.} 3. d4 {More principal than straightaway c4. Never spoil a good threat... This game is about using tempo, via pressure... } d6 {Practically forced: After Nb6 - to avoid c4 - a4!, with the lasting threat a5, plus Ra3 on the sly... } 4. Nf3 {The Flohr variation, widely recognized as to most solid approach for white... Spasski - Fischer 1972, game 13, continued with 4. ... g6?! 5. Bc4? (correct is Ng5!) Nb6 6. Bb3 Bg7, and white has nothing... Fischer won, unjustly... In game 19, Fischer continued with 4. ... Bg4 5. Be2 c6? (correct is e6) 6. Ng5? (too early, correct is c4) Bxe2 6. Qxe2, dxe5, 7. dxe5 (this is supposed to be Nxe5) e6 8. 0-0 Nd7 and drawed... White must learn from this... } Bg4 {It is too early for black, to whip up an attack against c2, via Nc6/Bf5 and Nb4...  This is the whole idea, behind blacks approach in Alekhine...  After Nc6, Bb5. After straightaway Bf5, Bd3, or Bb5+, c6, Bd3...  Nb4 can still be met with a3, after Nc6/Bf5...  White opens possibilities for Ng5, so it has to be pinned... } 5. Be2 {5. h3 Bxf3 6. Qxf3 dxe5 7. dxe5 e6 8. a3 spoils all tensions...  We aim for Ng5... } c6 {Highly inaccurate. This spoils all chances for Nc6, the only successfull parade in case of c4, Nb4!...  Black had to play 5. ... e6 (release Bf8, in case of exd6, and prepare dxe5, plus 0-0) 6. c4 (forced, if white wants to hold the initiative; after 6. 0-0 Nc6 7. c4 Nde7 black can break up all tensions), Nb6/e7... Nb8 becomes a burdon from now on... } 6. c4 {Also possible is 6. 0-0 dxe5 (e6, c4, Nc7, Qb3), 7. Nxe5... White prefers to postpone castling, and gains tempo in development, using clear threats...  } Nb6 {After 6. ... Nc7, 7. Qb3! b6 8. 0-0, black is already in trouble. Bxf3, Bxf3, is no longer an option... } 7. Nbd2 {6. ... Nb6, introduces again Bxf3, Bxf3, Nxc4...  7. Nbd2! solves this problem, in a very elegant way; all threats are maintained.  It is too early for 7. Ng5 Bxe2 8. Qxe2 dxe5 9. dxe5 e6 10. 0-0...  We play for bigger game... The following is practically forced...  } dxe5 {What else?  N8d7 is met with 0-0, dxe5, etc... } 8. Nxe5 {All part of the plan...  Let Bg4 declare its self...   } Bf5 {Again, black loses tempo. After 8. ... Bxe2, 9. Qxe2 e6 (N8d7, c5!, Nxe5, dxe5, Nd5, e6!) 10. 0-0 N8d7 11. Ndf3 is surely not in blacks best interrest...  After 9. ... Qxd4?! 10. Ndf3 Qc5 (Qd6, Ng5!) 11. a3! f6 (to avoid Ng5) 12. b4 Qd6, 13. c5!  I would say pawn d4 is pretty poisonous...  } 9. Ndf3 {The crown on the little combination, for white...  Black has sincere development problems:  9. ... N8d7 seems logical, but is - still - met with 10. Qb3! After 10. ... Nxe5 11. dxe5, the threat c5 becomes nasty.  10. Nxd7 Qxd7, looks promising but it is not part of whites plan...  9. ... f6 is met with 10. c5 fxe5 11. cxb6 Qxb6 12. Nxe5 Qb4+, 13. Kf1! (remember this) e6 14. a3!... } e6 {At least, black has Bb4+...  That is what he thinks...  Black will have to wait a long time now, to be able to develop Nb8, thanks to 5. ... c6...  } 10. Ng5 {10. Ng5! is practically the refutation of this all...  This is like Alekhine, playing white against f7... In stead of black, playing Nc6-Nb4 against c2...  The threat Nxf7 has to be met immediately... Black is lured into whites plan...  A mistake, would be 10. g4? Be4! 11. c5? f6! 12. Nd3 (what else?) Nd5, 13. 0-0 g5...  And whites hands are empty... From now on, Ng5 is a long lasting threat...    } Bb4+ {Black has to do something, in order to be able to castle at some point, but not too early...   After 10. ... f6, 11. Nef7, white is right...  After 10. ... Bg6, 11. Bh5!, the problem only grows bigger...  Now, after 11. Bd2? Qxg5! 12. Bxb4 Qxg2 13. Bf3 Qh3, shortly followed by f6...  White has only one option...  } 11. Kf1 {This is the move... } O-O {This is, what we call castling into trouble.  Black had no better, than 11. ... Bg6 12. Bh5 0-0 13. Bxg6! (not Qg4, Bxh5, Qxh5, h6) hxg6 14. Qg4! N8d7 15. Qh3 Nf6 16. Be3...  } 12. g4 {Serve any threat at the right time.  After Ng5, Be4 is no longer possible... However, white closes the diagonal to h5... That will soon be solved...  } Bg6 {It is too late for f6 now... Follows 13. gxf5 fxg5 (fxe5?, Nxe6) 14. c5! (Rg1, Rf5!) Nd5 15. a3! Ba5 16. Rg1... } 13. c5 {This nasty - wisely postponed - minor threat serves double now. We attack poor Alekhines Knight again, and cut off Bb4...  Straightaway 13. h4, Be7 14. Nxg6 hxg6 15. Nf3 c5! spoils all...  The trick now is, to make the most out of a3... } Nd5 {Still no option was 13. ... f6 14. Nxg6 hxg6 15. cxb6 fxg5 16. Qb3!  But it's still better than 13. ... Nd5, second time around...  13. ... N6d7? 14. Nxg6 hxg6 (fxg6, Nxe6) 15. Qb3!  13. ... h6? 14. Qb3! Qxd4 15. Nxg6 fxg6 16. Qxe6+ Kh8 17. Nf7+ Rxf7 18. Qe8+! (stronger than Qxf7, Bxc5, g5) Kh7 19. Qxf7 proves white right...   } 14. h4 {The sharpest continuation!  It is too early for 14. a3 Ba5 15. h4 Nf6 (h6, Nxg6, fxg6, Nxe6, Ne3+, Bxe3, Qd5, Kg1, Qxe6, Qa4 threatens deadly Bc4) 16. f3 Nbd7... Keep the tensions... } Nf6 {King's Knight back at f6... Probably the most solid continuation...  After straightaway 15. h5, at least there is Be4...  After 14. ... Nd7, 15. h5 Nxe5 16. dxe5 h6 17. hxg6 hxg5 18. Qc2!, black is in trouble for sure...  } 15. Qb3 {I preferred this over Bf3, of even f3, followed by Nbd7...  It releases the tensions too early, and will eventually lead to Qb3... Let's keep Nb8 at bay...  The following variation is - again - forced, since white maintains all his threats...  Black is on the brink of losing material...   } Qxd4 {Simply 15. ... a5, is met with 16. Nxg6 hxg6 17. a3 Bxc5 18. dxc5 Nbd7 19. Be3, and white wins... 15. ... Be4 is no longer possible: 16. Nxe4 Nxe4 17. Qxb4 Nd7 18. Bf3... } 16. Ngf3 {Likewise forced... } Qxc5 {After 16. ... Qe4, for sure 17. h5 Nbd7 18. Nxd7 Nxd7 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. g5... } 17. a3 {Serve out another trump... } Ba5 {It is hard to say, what options black has left.  Probably best is 17. ... Nd5 (again!?) 18. axb4 Qd6 19. Be3 Nxe3+ 20. Qxe3 Qxb4 21. Nc4 Nd7 22. h5 Bc2 23. Nd4 Ba4...  After 17. ... Nbd7, 18. Be3 Qd5,19. Qxd5 exd5 20. axb4...  } 18. Qxb7 {Never strike b7 with the Queen, unless it wins; so they say... Or b2, for black, for that matter...  To be totally honest, white has no options left.  18. h5?, is met with Be4! now... 18. g5 Nd5... 18. Nxg6 Nxg4!...  Let's see... } Nd5 {A rigourous way to lose material: King Alekhine's Knight travels to d5 for the third time; trying to avoid Be3, this time.  The natural reaction would be 18. ... Nbd7, to avoid just Qxa8. Follows 19. Nxd7 Nxd7 20. Be3 (b4, Qc3!, leads to complications) Qe7 21. Rd1! (stronger than directly Ne5) Rad8 22. Ne5 Be4 (finally!) 23. Rh3! winning Nd7... There is no grace for Nb8... } 19. Qxa8 {What can be said? There is no turning back... Let's make the most out of it...    } Bb6 {Obviously the only way to justify the sacrifice... White was threatening b4, after Qb7... Now, black threatens mate, and might capture whites Queen... } 20. Rh2 {Forced... But black still has to deal with h5... Nd7 fails on Qxc6...   } Be4 {Black collapses under the pressure of h4-h5...  Correct was 20. ... Qe7, followed by Qc7, and Nd7, to try and capture whites Queen...  Probably the cost is too high after 20. ... Qe7 21. a4 Qc7 22. a5! Bxa5 (Bc5, a6, rendering b7 for the Queen) 23. Nc4! Nd7 24. Qxf8+ Nxf8 25. Rxa5...} 21. Qb7 {Thus, whites Queen survives, getting black in new kinds of trouble... The threat h4-h5-h6 is still there, now accompanied, after - again! - Ng5, by the threat Nxf7/Nxe4... 21. ... f6 is practically forced now. 21. ... Qc2 (to avoid Be3, on top of all this, and to cover c6/g6) is met by 22. a4!, threatening Ne1, Qb3, a5!... After 21. ... Bxf3, 22. Nxf3 Qd6 (to facilitate Nd7), 23. h5! } f6 {The threat Ng5 has to be met... } 22. h5 {Consequent... Insufficient is 22. Nf7 Bc7! 23. Nh6+ Kh8!  Of course, after 22. ... fxe5, 23. h6, keeping the threat Ng5... After 22. ... Bxf3, Nxf3...  } fxe5 {More resiliant was 22. ... Bc7 23. h6 Qb6 24. Qxb6 axb6 25. hxg7 Re8 26. Bd3 Bxd3+ 27. Nxd3 Bxh2 28. Nxh2 Kxg7...  Trying to squirm out with 22. ... Bxf3 23. Nxf3 Qd6 24. Bd3 f5 25. gxf5 Nd7 (finally) 26. Qa6 Nc5 27. Qc4 Nxd3 28. Qxd3 Rxf5 29. Rh4! Ne3+ 30. Ke2 is winning for white...} 23. h6 {There is - again - no way back for white... We threaten mate... } Qe7 {No good is 23. ... Ne7 24. hxg7 Re8 25. Ng5 Bg6 26. Be3 Qc2 27. Re1 Qd2 28. Rf2! Qd7 29. Qxd7 Nxd7 30. Rc1...  Best is probably 23. ... Nc7 24. Be3 Qe7 25. hxg7 Re8...  This is an awkward moment to swap Queens... White has no choice, however: 24. Ba6? Qxb7 25. Bxb7 Bxf3, and white loses...  } 24. Qxe7 Nxe7 25. Ng5 {Again, Ng5 saves the day... After Nxe5, g6! white loses his edge... We have to keep pushing; we are - technically - still in the opening stage of the game! Both sides are still not fully developed, and allready at war... The following is - again - forced... Bc2/Bg6 (to maintain control over h7) is met with Nxe6, Rf7, Nxg7/hxg7... After 25. ... Bd5 (else Nxe6), 26. hxg7 Rf6 (else Rxh7) 27. Bd3 seals the fate of h7...    } Bd5 26. hxg7 {Still, also white is playing a forced continuation, from 19. Qxa8 and onwards, trying to prove his point.  All other moves lead to g6 now, or - worse - to gxh6, and eventually to Nb8-d7-f6.   We have no choice, than to present black with another forcing; Rf8 has to remain on the f-file to keep the pressure on pawn f2, else Rxh7 and blacks King is a sitting duck.  After 26. ... Kxg7, 27. Rxh7+ Kf6 (else Rxe7) 28. Bd3 e4 29. Nxe4+ Bxe4 30. Bxe4 Nd5/e5 (Ke5, f3, Nd5, Bh6) 31. f4/Bh6 overpowers black...  White has to buy time, in order to be able to complete his development. Bc1 is fine, and probably the strongest piece on the board right now, supporting Ng5. However, Ra1 has to be developed via a4, Ra3, followed by Rah3...  After 26. ... Rf6 (else Rxh7) 27. Bd3 (prevents e5-e4 for the time being, thanks to Ng5) Bd4/Nd7 (at last) 28. Bxh7+ Kxg7 29. Bc2, ... 30. a4...   } Kxg7 27. Rxh7+ {For some reason, black still believes in keeping f2 under pressure, and buckles.  27. ... Kf6 (else Rxe7) breaks up the pressure on f2, so 28. Bd3, followed by Ne4+... 27. ... Kg6 28. Rxe7 Rxf2+ 29. Ke1 e4 (Rf8, Bd3+, e4) 30. Nxe4 Bxe4? 31. Rxe6+... See above for further variations...  } Kf6 28. Bd3 e4 29. Nxe4+ Bxe4 30. Bxe4 e5 31. Ke2 Ke6 32. Be3 Nd7 33. Rh6+ Kf7 34. g5 {Black resigned from this training game. Here is, what could have followed...  CherryPie, Thanks for this thrilling exposure... I could not have done it without you...  Regards, Bonnie... }
