1. e4 e5 {Nothing special yet} 2. b4 {?! This is an interesting move, possibly looking for flank operations, and fianchettoing his DSB.} Nf6 3. g4 {? This is just a mistake as it leaves the e pawn open for attack and ruins the kingside's pawn defense.} d5 {I'm not sure whether capturing the pawn was better, but it might have been.} 4. exd5 Bxg4 5. f3 Nxd5 {?! This loses a piece, but after he captures I get a attack against the WK.} 6. fxg4 Qh4+ {Here it comes...} 7. Ke2 Qxg4+ 8. Nf3 Qe4+ 9. Kf2 Nxb4 {I've regained material equality, I looked at Bc5+ but he can defend with d4. } 10. Nc3 Bc5+ {I decide to play it anyway, and look for an opening.} 11. d4 Bxd4+ 12. Be3 {?? Loses the piece for nothing} Qxe3+ 13. Kg3 Qf4+ 14. Kh3 Bxc3 {After deciding that I can't really hunt the king down with only my queen over there, I grab another piece and decide to simplify to a won endgame.} 15. Rc1 Nxa2 16. Rb1 b6 17. Qd3 Nc6 18. Rd1 {Uh-oh, here's where alarm bells started to go off, he has a promising attack down the d file.} g5 {? Somewhat naive, I expected I could handle whatever he could throw at me and I tried to continue my earlier attack. Better would have been O-O. If I'd castled here I think I probably would have won, but white wouldn't have been able to stage such a great comeback.} 19. Qd7+ Kf8 20. Bc4 {?? loses a bishop for nothing.} g4+ {I decide the best defense is a good offense and go on the attack. Notice, that I can simply capture his bishop, but I played this first because if he moves to g3 then I can take the knight and mate.} 21. Kg2 Qxc4 {Better might have been capturing the knight because that would continue the attack, but I played this to get rid of the mate threat.} 22. Ng5 {Not for long...} Qf4 23. Rdf1 {Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!} Nd8 {Loses my queen for rook, but I couldn't find anything else. Anyway, I'll still have a massive materiel advantage not that it helped me much.} 24. Rxf4 exf4 {Let's analyze here for a moment. Black is massively ahead, but white had a devastating attack going on that might make black sac more material to defend. Also, black's rooks aren't really doing anything and his minor pieces are either (in the case of the d knight) tied down defending against something, or (in the case of the bishop and knight) lured over there and incapable of assisting the defense more than a little.} 25. Rf1 {! This was a good move. It forces me to do something about the attack on my pawn because otherwise another attacker will be added to the f pawn.} f3+ 26. Kg3 Bf6 {I attempt to drive away the knight} 27. Kxg4 {! Defends the knight and captures the pawn. It also (more importantly) undefends my leading f pawn which will let him get his rook in the attack.} Bxg5 {I take the opportunity to remove a attacker.} 28. Rxf3 {? Looks good, but I think I would have actually recaptured.} f6 {?? I think this is a real blunder. I think I should have played Rg8 and then advanced it to g7 to add another defender. If I had, I might have survived.} 29. h4 {! This forces another defender to leave.} Bd2 30. Rxf6+ {Wham! At this stage, I believe my king is doomed.} Kg8 31. Qd5+ {If it weren't for my knight on d8, he'd have mate. As it is, he's got an extremely strong attack.} Kg7 {I played this to try to get my rook more active.} 32. Qe5 {Qg5+?? would fall to my DSB.} Kg8 {I step out of the discovered check, but it doesn't help.} 33. c3 {? Seems like a waste.} Nf7 {I was very very tempted to play Bxc3????? but that would undefend g5 allowing mate in one.} 34. Qe7 Nh6+ {If he takes my knight (I know, it's unlikely) then I can recapture and have a won game. } 35. Kf3 {Sigh, oh well.} Bxc3 36. Rf4 {Threatens mate in one with Qg5#} Bg7 {This barely holds everything together.} 37. Qe6+ {!! This really, really, really, hurts, my only move is to block and next move mate} Nf7 38. Qxf7# {Mate! recently this player was barely 950 rated, but I think he's better than that and I hope (and expect) he's on an upward curve. Please comment, I would really appreciate it and rate.}
