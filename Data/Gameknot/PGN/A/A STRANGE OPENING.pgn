1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Qg5 {this is not a right opening for black ! 3. Nf3 ! Qxg2 ? 4.Rg1 Qh3 5. Bxf7 !! is winning for white} 3. Qf3 {i will surely play Nf3 next time !} Nf6 4. Nc3 {looking for d4} Qg6 {a good place for black queen} 5. d3 Bb4 6. Bd2 {h4 was better to track the black queen} d6 {looking for Bg4} 7. Qg3 Qxg3 8. hxg3 Bg4 9. a3 {Nb5 was nice, even if Bxd2, Kxd2 Na6} Bxc3 {at this time i had two moves Bxc3 or gxc3. i wanted to have more space for my rooks, but it seems that fritz disagree with this} 10. bxc3 {Bxc3 was better} Nbd7 11. f3 {now fritz recommands Nb6 for black ! :  11.Nb6 fxg4 Nxc4 dxc4 Nxe4 ! with a destructured white pawn chain} Be6 12. Bxe6 fxe6 13. Rb1 O-O-O 14. Be3 c5 15. d4 Kb8 16. Ne2 Rdc8 17. O-O {a pure blunder ! now black earns a pawn  } cxd4 18. cxd4 Rxc2 19. Rfe1 Ra2 {a correct move} 20. Rb3 {white have -  0.75 with fritz 8} exd4 21. Nxd4 Nc5 22. Rc3 {white are still late} Rb2 {a weak move : a6 was better to avoid Kb5 now fritz recommands 23. Rxc5 ! dxc 24. Nxe6 b6 25. Nxg6 with an equal game} 23. Rec1 Rf8 {now Rxc5 is still valid} 24. Rc3xc5 {fritz gives  -0.6 for white, that means than from now i am going to earn the equivalent of 4 pawns !} dxc5 25. Nxe6 {first !} Rf7 26. Bf4+ Kc8 27. Rxc5+ {second pawn ! retreiving the lost material with attack .  fritz avaluates this to  1.31, the rook sacrifice was really winning  } Kd7 {the only move to continue. } 28. Ng5 {no, this only retreive one pawn,  the tactic 28. Nxg2 Rxg2 29. Rxg2 Rc7  was winning material chess is full of good moves we forgot to play ! } Rb1+ 29. Kh2 Re7 30. e5 Ne8 {the only move that maintain black to survive fritz gives  0.5 for white} 31. Nxh7 {third and last pawn that gives an equal material} Ke6 32. Ng5+ Kf5 {now fritz suggests Bd2} 33. Ne4 b6 {a bad move, giving access to 6th line for white rook.  now i had a plan:  as the black king is trapped in a mate network, the idea is to push g3-g4, but first protect my bishop, and move the knight to g5 again } 34. Rc4 {indirectly protects f4} Rb2 35. Ng5 {now g4 is possible} Rc7 {only move that avoids white to enter } 36. g4+ {intermediate !} Kg6 {exchanging rooks is going to a draw game } 37. Rd4 {a little trap ...  } Rcc2 {an error ... black are too hungry and must defend by Re7 } 38. Rd8 {the knight is lost and on 38. .. Rxg2  39. Kh3, the mate is saved with my bishop that controls h2 !} Rcxg2+ 39. Kh3 {the suite could have been 39.  ... Rg1 40. Rxe8 Rh1  41. Kg3 Rg1  41. Kh4 Rh1  42. Nh3 ! avoids the perpertual check ...} Nf6 {what else ?} 40. exf6 {if gxf6, Rg8#} Kxf6 41. Rd7 {a powerful intermediate move black cannot avoid 42. Nh7  Ke6 (or g6) 43. Nf8  Kf6 44. g5 Rxg5 45.Nh7  winning the rook in all variants. black are lost} a6 42. Nh7+ Ke6 43. Nf8+ {my opponent surely went in holidays at this time when he saw 43 ... Kf6 g5 Rxg5 (Kf5 Rf7 mate) Nh7  taking a rook}
