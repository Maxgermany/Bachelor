1. e4 {This is what passes for my opening repertoire. Not very original huh? I like this game because although I gave up a large advantage I gained early. I finished with a very pretty forced mate.} e5 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nxe5 {I won't play exd5 because of e4, threatening my knight.} d4 {Letting go of the e-file for the sake of an advanced d pawn.} 4. g3 {I want to fianchetto my white bishop.} f6 {Of course.} 5. Nf3 c5 {This lets me know he doesn't have any immediate plans to lose another pawn so I might as well release my good bishop.} 6. d3 b6 {I'm sure I would pay dearly for delaying development if my opponent weren't also pushing pawns.} 7. c3 Nc6 8. Bg2 Bd6 9. O-O Nge7 10. cxd4 {Time to open things up.} cxd4 11. b3 Ba6 12. Bb2 {Attack d4 a second time.} Nb4 {Black almost had a good attack, he should have simply protected the d pawn.} 13. Bxd4 {And I didn't see what was coming.} Bxd3 {A rook for a bishop?} 14. Re1 {No thanks.} Nc2 {A rook for a bishop and a knight I'll take.} 15. Qxd3 Nxe1 16. Nxe1 {And I win the exchange (this game helped me recognize the superiority of a bishop and a knight against a rook in many positions)} Bb4 {Attacking my undefended knight.} 17. Nc3 {stops the threat to the knight while releasing my rook. } O-O 18. Ne2 {Get my knight to a more useful square but I missed the fork.} f5 19. Qc4+ {Now I see it.} Rf7 20. Qxb4 {And I get a bishop for free.} Nc6 {Not surprising.} 21. Qa4 {Now the knight can't threaten my queen for at least three moves.} Rc8 22. Be3 Ne5 23. Nf3 Nxf3+ 24. Bxf3 Qf6 {I was afraid of an attack down the f-file and didn't recognize the purpose of that move.} 25. Nf4 {So I tried to shore things up a bit.} Qxa1+ {Oops, there goes my advantage.} 26. Kg2 {Forced.} Rc2 {That's when I saw my chance. If I could just free my bishop without tipping my hand to black.} 27. exf5 {Taking the pawn on f5 looks innocent enough.} Rxf5 {Too bad it's mate in three because I have a chance to gain some material by forking the rooks.} 28. Qe8+ {One.} Rf8 {Notice that this forced move moves the rook away from guarding the d5 square.} 29. Bd5+ {Two.} Kh8 {Forced.} 30. Qxf8# {Three.}
