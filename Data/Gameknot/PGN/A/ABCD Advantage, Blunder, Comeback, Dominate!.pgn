[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C77), Anderssen variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 {A little passive, as allowing the pawn to be taken (with, for example, 5. 0-0 Nxe4) offers no advantage after 6. d4 or 6. Rd1. Not a bad move, but I'd prefer 0-0.} b5 6. Bb3 Be7 {Bc5 is also good, but with white having played d3, I'm thinking that c7-c5 is looking good down the line, working the center and queenside.} 7. a3 {And although this is fine, I prefer either 0-0, c3, or Nc3 here. In many variations of the Ruy Lopez, black will play Na5, trying to either force the exchange of white's bishop or allowing for the queenside expansion. White's bishop is normally dangerous in the Ruy because it winds up on the b1-h7 diagonal; but white's a3 instead of c3 prevents that.} O-O {So that gives us our plan: castle, protect the pawn on e5, play Na5, play c5. Let's see where that gets us.} 8. Nc3 {0-0 is still good here, but Nc3 is fine as well.} d6 9. h3 {I didn't expect him to be afraid of Bg4, which is reasonable, I suppose, but now I get to execute my Na5, c5 plan *and* his king is still in the center.} Na5 10. Ba2 {Of course, the only sensible move.} c5 11. b4 {A reasonable move, fighting back on the queenside and preventing b4, although I had no intention of playing b4.} Nc6 {Better than cxb4 12. axb4, where the knight has to retreat and white has options in deciding what to do about the b4 pawn.} 12. Be3 {Interesting. White decides to allow black to win the b4 pawn (13... cxb4 and if 14. axb4, Nxb4 is good for black). 12. Nd5 was the way to contest it.} Bb7 {And I miss it, of course. This isn't necessarily the best square for the bishop, even, as d7 also offers promise.} 13. O-O {Again offering the b4 pawn; Nd5 once again would have protected it.} Nd4 {...and I miss it again. cxb4 was still better, although this creates a lot of tension in the center, and the knight cannot be taken without consequences.} 14. Bxd4 {Not as bad as 14. Nxd4 exd4, and white loses a piece, but Bxd4 gives black a very strong presence on d4.} cxd4 {A better capture than exd4, as this half-opens up the c-file for the rook.} 15. Ne2 {Pretty much the only move in town; Nd5 and Nb1 accomplish nothing good for white.} Re8 {Qd7 and Rc8 are also worth considering here. Re8 sets up the potential for d5 down the road, a strike for control of the center.} 16. Nd2 {Now this is unfortunate; white simply abandons his pressure on the e5 pawn, allowing black to play d5 with no consequence.} d5 {At this point, I'd say black has a nice little advantage. The pressure in the center, the space, and the reach of his pieces are all superior to his white counterpart.} 17. f3 {Threatening to half-open the f-file if dxe4, but this has the effect of weakening the dark squares around the white king. If black can find a way to effectively attack them, white could lose his king.} Rc8 {And this is a threat down the c-file. The queen is now tied to the c-pawn's defense.} 18. Bb3 {Giving the Queen her freedom back.} a5 {Threatening to drive the bishop off of b3 with a thrust to a4.} 19. Ng3 {Another slight mistake, as this does a number of bad things. First off, it un-defends the c6 square, which a black piece can now occupy. Second, it put the knight on a light square around the white king, where it's very difficult to defend. And third, it allows a4, which is bad for white. bxa5 was better here, but black is still up after Qxa5.} a4 {Of course.} 20. Ba2 {The only move.} Rc3 {Threatens the pawn on a3, and it allows for the construction of a battering ram down the c-file if black wants. Also worth considering was Qc7, which forces either an awkward Bb1 or Rc1.} 21. Qc1 {This is the end of the "A" -- or advantage -- stage of this game. Black doesn't exactly have a won game, but with the two bishops, active pieces, more space, and weak targets to pressure, he's got a very nice advantage.} Nh5 {?? And now, dreadfully, he throws it away. Welcome to the "B", for blunder. Here, have a free knight.} 22. Nxh5 {Somehow, I thought the queen was protecting that knight. (How many things are wrong with that?!) At this point, down a knight in material, I thought about resigning. I'm clearly down. But white has plenty of weaknesses, still, and black has lots of pieces to pressure white with. While my last move wasn't exactly a brilliant sacrifice, the d8-h4 diagonal is now open for business!} Bg5 {When you're down in material, one of the best strategies is to force your opponent to make difficult moves. Objectively, Qc7 may have been better, but this move is more threatening. If white can't find 23. f4, he could have problems holding on to his extra material.} 23. Ng3 {? And here it is: the start of the "C" phase: the Comeback! f4 was much better and is the refutation of 22... Bg5, but this move allows black to claw back into the game.} Be3+ {A nasty check that makes up for the missing knight.} 24. Kh2 {24. Rf2 is not really any better than this move, as 24... Qh4 would pack a nasty punch. Black still has his work cut out here to turn this into a win, but there's no way black is lost at this point.} Qg5 {Now it becomes clear how the weak dark squares hurt white. The king is in danger of getting mated, the knight on d2 is as good as gone, and white's queenside is trapped in a box. White must play very precisely to get out of this alive.} 25. exd5 {And this isn't it. The knight on d2 is gone, but grabbing this pawn does nothing to address white's real problem: his very weak kingside.} Bxd2 {In control positionally, so that despite the material disadvantage, black is winning here.} 26. Qd1 {It may seem like a perfectly reasonable move, to keep black from simply taking the queen. But this allows black to play the killer Bf4, threatening to weave a mating net around the white king; better was 26. f4.} Bf4 {Very strong, this move forces white to address the terrible double threat on g3.} 27. Qe1 {The best fighting chance. At this point, I had a tough choice, because two ways looked enticing. One of them is Rxc2, where black starts to dominate the 2nd rank. But also tempting was Rxa3.} Rxa3 {And although post-mortem analysis says that Rxc2 was better, I saw something spectacular with Rxa3 that made me go for it. Can you see the plan?} 28. d6 {Maybe Qf2 would've shown a little more fight, but there's little white can do to stop black at this point.} Bd5 {! A very nice move. This brings us to the final stage of the game, "D" for Dominate!  Can you see why the bishop is immune?} 29. Bxd5 {White doesn't see it, can you?} Rxa1 {This move makes the problem crystal clear. White needs his queen to protect the g3 knight, otherwise the white king has to deal with insurmountable mate threats. Rxa1 forces the queen to f2 (all other moves leave the Ng3 -- and the white king -- hung out to dry), and after Rxf1, white is out of tricks.} 30. Qxa1 {? And now there's a mate in 6. Can you find it?} Qxg3+ {The first step is pretty easy. This forces the king to g1, as 31. Kh1 leads to Qh2#.} 31. Kg1 Qh2+ {Now the king is forced to f2.} 32. Kf2 Bg3+ {The last challenging move; cutting off the e1 square is the key here.} 33. Ke2 {Forced.} Qxg2+ {Just two more moves now.} 34. Kd1 {Or 34. Rf2 Qxf2+ 35. Kd1 Qe1#.} Qxf1+ {The ironic finish, that after blundering a knight and later sacrificing a bishop, black -- currently up a rook -- could take an extra queen if he wanted to.} 35. Kd2 {The only move.} Bf4# {But checkmating the king is much better.  Don't give up just because you've blundered, not when you've still got a fighting chance. Victory could be as easy as ABCD!}
