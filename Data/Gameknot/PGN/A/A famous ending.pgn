1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Adams aggressively attacks the Philidor's Defense setup Torre chooses to play.} exd4 4. Qxd4 {Bringing out his Queen early... but in this game he makes it work.} Nc6 {Attempting to gain time by attacking the Queen. But...} 5. Bb5 {No retreat for me, Adams says!} Bd7 6. Bxc6 {Choosing to exchange rather than remove his Queen from her central position.} Bxc6 7. Nc3 {Surprisingly, Adams has made his system work. He has a lead in development of 3 pieces to 1 and a central advantage.} Nf6 8. O-O Be7 {Torre prepares to castle into safety.} 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. exd5 {Fully opening the King file and cramping Torre with a Pawn on Q5.} O-O 11. Bg5 {Pressing the attack onwards! No fear from this amateur.} c6 {Attacking Adams' cramping QP.} 12. c4 {Reinforcing the Pawn.} cxd5 13. cxd5 {Fully opening another file. Now the QB-file can be used as an attacking avenue.} Re8 14. Rfe1 {Both players battle for the open file.} a5 15. Re2 Rc8 {Seizing the QB-file.} 16. Rae1 {Countering by doubling on the K file.} Qd7 17. Bxf6 {Forcing Torre to either weaken his K-side Pawns or open the K file to the battery of Rooks.} Bxf6 {This is the point at which most books pick up the game. If Black's Queen fails to guard the Rook at his K1, the continuation is RxR ch RxR RxR mate.} 18. Qg4 {18... QxQ is impossible, so...} Qb5 19. Qc4 {Now both ...RxQ AND ..QxQ are ruled out.} Qd7 20. Qc7 {The Queen is again immune.} Qb5 21. a4 {The Queen must stay on the diagonal, but cannot move to B3 or Q2. So...} Qxa4 {Forced.} 22. Re2e4 {22... QxR would be answered by 23 RxQ, and Torre cannot capture either the Queen or Rook without allowing mate.} Qb5 23. Qxb7 {23... QxQ, Q-R5, Q-B3 and Q-Q2 are all ruled out. Mate is unstoppable, so Torre resigns.}
