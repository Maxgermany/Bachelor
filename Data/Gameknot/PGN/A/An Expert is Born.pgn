1. e4 c5 {It was like watching the odometer on my car roll over from 99,999 to 100,000 - seemed to take forever. But this is the game that tipped the rating into the Expert realm. This is a Fast Ladder game. I challenged as far up the lader as it would let me, and this game is the result. It's a bloody one, which seems quite befitting for my advent into Expertdom. I begin by challenging 1. e4 with the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. g3 Nc6 {3. g3 was an interesting choice. Evidently playable, but not any of white's main replies. Apparently Fischer played it once with crushing success. I reply by developing.} 4. Bg2 g6 {If white can do it, black can do it too...} 5. O-O Bg7 6. c3 e5 {My fianchettoed bishop on g7 gets granite for his trouble, so I push into the center.} 7. Na3 Nge7 {To cover the hole on d5, prepare a push to d5, and to be immune to a possible future pin by a white bishop on g5.} 8. Qb3 Be6 {8. Qb3 is a little bit of a fork. The queen forks black's pawn on b7, tying the DSB down to defense, and black's pawn on f7 which comes into real danger after the inevitable 9. Ng5. So I scrounged around for a solution and kept looking at 8. ... Be6. It obviously loses a pawn, but it keeps the kingside safe. Is it worth it? So I analyzed it a bit further and realized fairly quickly that the b7 pawn is quite safe.} 9. Qxb7 a6 {Or so I thought. This is where white should have asked why his opponent blundered away a pawn. The answer is quite tragic for the far-flung white queen, so far from home and all alone.} 10. b4 Ra7 {White's queen has nowhere to run. She snarfed up a pawn and for her trouble, she ends up falling to a rook.} 11. Qxa7 Nxa7 12. Nc2 cxb4 13. cxb4 Bc4 {Time to free up the position a little, and win another pawn.} 14. Re1 Bd3 15. Ne3 Bxe4 {I suppose white could trap his knight over on a3, in which case he would be for all intents and purposes a piece down. Instead, white played the better knight move, but it cost him a pawn.} 16. Bb2 O-O 17. Rac1 Qa8 {The queen has cornered herself, but the threat, and the inevitable pieces to be exchanged are worth it, for now.} 18. Nh4 Rc8 {But first contest the open file.} 19. Bf1 Rxc1 20. Rxc1 Bb7 21. Nc4 Qd8 {Defending d6 and b6. Black is ahead materially, but white pieces have more scope and freedom and white is enjoying the initiative. Black needs to remedy that.} 22. a4 Bc6 23. Na5 Bxa4 {Time to liquidate some material, gaining another pawn in the process.} 24. Bxa6 Qb6 25. Bf1 Qxb4 26. Bc3 Qb8 {Most importantly, black eliminated white's biggest advantage, the queenside pawn majority. 26. ... Qc8 was to prevent any 7th or 8th rank rook shenanigans.} 27. Nc4 Nac6 28. Bd3 e4 {Another pawn sacrifice, such as it is. This one is also troublesome for white and should be declined.} 29. Bxe4 d5 {A fork.} 30. Rb1 Bb3 {White tried counterattacking, but the threat is parried and the white pieces are still forked. There is no fear for the pin on the bishop, it is easy enough to defend.} 31. Nb6 Ba2 {Black keeps two white pieces en prise, but frees his bishop from the pin. White now has a discovered threat against the black queen, but not while his rook is en prise.} 32. Rb2 Bxc3 {Black gains material and keeps two white pieces en prise.} 33. dxc3 dxe4 {And now white can trade bishop for knight, but is down in material sufficiently that black would be very welocoming of such a trade. } 34. c4 Qa7 {I almost blew it there. I had entered 34. ... Bxc4 thinking white could not recapture with the knight since the knight is pinned to the undefended rook. Oops. Fortunately, I caught my mistake before clicking Submit. Playing way too fast I suppose. As played, 34. ... Qa7 defends the bishop and gets the queen off of the rook's file.} 35. Ng2 Qa3 {Soo many bad moves for white after right now. Almost all rook moves lose material to a queen fork. White must be careful.} 36. Re2 Bxc4 {White found the right move but it costs him another pawn.} 37. Nxc4 Qd3 {Another fork.} 38. Nf4 Qxc4 {Nothing left but the mopping up, now.} 39. Re3 Nf5 {Again, white has many choices, but only 1 rook move that doesn't immediately lose the rook.} 40. Ra3 Qc1+ {This time, white missed the fork. Black was obliged to show whate what he'd missed and, consequently, white resigned. As promised, it was bloody, brutal, and appropriately fitting for this milestone game.}
