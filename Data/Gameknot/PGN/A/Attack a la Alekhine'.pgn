1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Qe2 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. c3 {In connection with the following move this is a safe method of preparing to counter the aggressive plan of Black which was indicated by his seventh move.} d5 9. d3 dxe4 {The opening of the queen's file is to White's advantage. But 9. ... d4 10. cxd4 Nxd4 11. Nxd4 Qxd4 12. Nc3 followed by 13. Be3 would also have involved difficulty for Black.} 10. dxe4 Bg4 11. h3 Bh5 12. Bg5 {Preventing 12. ... Na5 which would be refuted by 13. g4 Bg6 14. Nxe5 simply winning a pawn.} Ne8 13. Bxe7 {If immediately 13. ... Nxe7 then 14. g4 etc.} Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Nxe7 15. Rd1 Nd6 16.

Nbc4 White would acquire a decisive positional advantage by means of 23. Bxc4 bxc4 24. Qc5!} 23. exf5 c5 {It is already the end. To 23. ... Nd5 White would have replied 24. Qf3 after which Black's position could not be held.} 24. f6 gxf6 25. Qh6 f5 26. Bxf7+ {!! A elegant finish. Whether of not he captures the bishop Black loses material.} Qxf7 27. Rxd8 Na4 28. b3 {If 28. ... Nxc3 there follows 29. Raa8. A splendid game by Alekhine.}
