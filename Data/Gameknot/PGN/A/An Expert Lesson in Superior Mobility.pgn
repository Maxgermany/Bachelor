1. Nc3 {Hi everyone!  I lost my 11th game against Coach Ion.  He won this game due to superior mobility.  Here I will show you just how Ion was able to use this mobility to convert it to victory.  I kick off with Master Freddy's opening, the Dunst Opening, with 1. Nc3.} d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. Bg5 {3. Bg5 - development.} c6 4. e3 Qb6 {4....... Qb6 - putting the b2 pawn under the hammer.  I defend with 5. Rb1.} 5. Rb1 Ne4 6. Nxe4 dxe4 {6. ....... dxe4 - a knight trade.  Ion now has a doubleton on the e file.} 7. Qd2 Bf5 8. Bc4 {8. Bc4 - time to start clearing those decks.} h6 9. Bf4 Nd7 10. Ne2 {10. Ne2 - clearing the way for kingside castling.} e6 11. h3 Rd8 12. c3 e5 13. Bh2 {13. Bh2 - I'm glad I played h3 - wasn't too worried about Ion's bishop going to g4 but this created a foxhole for Fou Lenoir.  I thought that the h2 to b8 diagonal was a good one for this prelate to be on.  Also, I did not exchange pawns on d5 due to the fact that Ion's rook was on the same file as Glenda and I did not want any discoveries from Ion.} Bd6 14. Qc2 Bg6 15. a3 {15. a3 - creating a foxhole for my other bishop, Fou Leblanc to keep him on the a2-g8 diagonal.} O-O 16. O-O {16. 0-0 - at last both sides castle kingside.} Qc7 17. Rbd1 {17. Rbd1 - now that Glenda is defending (does she do anything else?) the b pawn, I decide to improve the position of my queen rook, move it to d1 and perhaps lay the ground for some trades a few moves down the line.} Kh7 18. Qc1 f5 19. dxe5 Nxe5 20. Bxe5 {20. Bxe5 - that black horsie of Ion's looked too well centralised so I decided to trade in Fou Lenoir for it.  This is not the end of the trades though.} Bxe5 21. Rxd8 Rxd8 22. Rd1 {22. Rd1 - contesting the d column.} b5 23. Bb3 Be8 24. Rxd8 {24. Rxd8?! - in retrospect maybe I could have delayed this trade by playing Bc2 and then b4.  This move may well have enabled me to have put my e2 knight on d4 after the second rook trade and this may well have made the vital difference between another loss to Ion and a high draw.} Qxd8 25. Qd1 Qe7 {25. ....... Qe7 - Ion decides not to trade queens.  If that had happened, even though Ion had the bishop pair and a slight spatial edge, my drawing chances would have been good sans les reines.  Glenda's "control" of the d file is somewhat illusory, only d2 is available to her.} 26. Nd4 {26. Nd4 - my knight does go to d4, but because there is a black pawn on c6 he will not be able to stay there.  See my note on move 24.} Bd7 27. Kf1 {27. Kf1 - even though the queens are still on the board, my gut instinct tells me to move Henry towards the centre.  This turned out to be a good plan.} c5 28. Ne2 Bc6 29. a4 {29. a4?! - a double edged plan here.  I try to create more mobility for Glenda, and try to get some more space for my pieces.  This, unfortunately, will backfire on me.} a6 30. axb5 axb5 31. Qa1 {31. Qa1 - Glenda immediately occupies the a file.} g6 32. Qa6 Qd7 {32. ........ Sss, the Wicked Witch of the West now makes her presence felt.  She defends Ion's lsb and takes control of the d file and threatens to invade on d2.  Henry bravely takes one step to the left to prevent the Witch from landing there.} 33. Ke1 {33. Ke1 - It was here that I decided to offer Ion a draw.  If my knight had been able to have kept his outpost on d4 my offer would have been successful (notwithstanding my previous diabolical form against the Experts and Masters).  However, because of Ion having the bishop pair and superior mobility, Ion declined.  He got it right, sigh!} h5 {33. ...... h5 - Ion starts a pawn roll.} 34. Bc2 {34. Bc2 - this move also prevents the Witch from landing on d3.} h4 35. Qb6 {35. Qb6 - trying to keep the BQ and BB tied down to the queenside pawns.} Qd6 36. b3 Kh6 37. c4 {37. c4?? - Ion pointed out to me in the post match pm that he thought that this was the losing move.  This will allow the Witch to invade on d2 with disastrous consequences.  Maybe I should have just shuttled Glenda from a6-b6 maintaining her hold on the black queenside pawns but I have done things like this in other games and it just seemed so tedious.  Here it would have saved my neck I think!} b4 38. Qa6 Bc3+ {38. ....... Bc3+!! - the killer.} 39. Nxc3 bxc3 40. Qa2 Qd2+ {40. ........ Qd2+ - the invader.} 41. Kf1 {41. Kf1 (forced)} f4 42. Qb1 {42. Qb1 - worried about back rank checks from the Witch I decided to move Glenda to b1.  Glenda and Fou Leblanc now defend each other.  I now lose a pawn though.} fxe3 43. fxe3 Qxe3 44. Qe1 Qxe1+ 45. Kxe1 {45. Kxe1 - there seemed to be nothing better than to exchange queens.  With the Witch so close to Henry I felt Old Matey's cold, stinking breath all over me! } e3 46. Kf1 {41. Kf1 - Henry defends the pawn on g2.} Kg5 47. Bd3 Kf4 {47. ....... Kf4 - Ion's king now invades.  The end is nigh.} 48. Bxg6 {48. Bxg6 - material is back to even but after Ion's next move, Be4!! interfering with Fou Leblanc's defense of c2 I decided to wave the white flag.  Unless I gave up Fou Leblanc, that c2 pawn was going to crown and then Ion would have soon forced checkmate.  At least this game was one of my better efforts against Ion, in fact I think the best since The Battle of the Wings - apart from my draws against Patrick Scott and therealjimfriar that third half point against 2000+ oppo remains elusive - but with a game like this I still live in hope.  } Be4 {}
