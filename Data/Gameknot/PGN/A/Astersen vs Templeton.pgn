[Opening "Old Benoni defence (A43)"]

1. d4 c5 {My usual response to a queen's pawn opening is King's Indian, but KI is very positional, and I don't tend to do well with it against higher rated players.  My opponent is 400 points higher rated, so I decided to try something different.  I like to keep Benoni in my back pocket in case of emergencies, like this one.  I like it because its lines resemble Sicilian, which is my most played opening.} 2. Bf4 cxd4 {I am never afraid of drawing a queen out early.  It almost always gives some great opportunities for development while chasing the opposing queen around the board.} 3. Qxd4 Nc6 {Chasing/development.} 4. Qe3 Nf6 {Preparing to chase/development} 5. Bg5 {Breaks up the Nd4 fork.} e5 {I needed to free my queen and bishop to join in the queen hunt.} 6. Bxf6 {Surprise!  Not a move I expected from a 1900 player.} Qxf6 7. Nc3 {Nice development.  The knight gets nicely in my way and opens up the long castle, putting the rook right where I don't want it.} Qd6 {The only sensible thing to do was to block the castle.  Otherwise, it was going to go downhill fast.} 8. Nb5 {White didn't look closely enough before moving.  He thought  he had me hung, because the only safe place to put my queen is b8, which is extremely counterproductive.  White later admitted that this move was the mistake that cost him the game.} Qb4+ {What white missed was the Zwischenzug.  This puts white in a bad position.  His only response is to jump back with the knight, giving up two pawns in the process.} 9. Nc3 Qxb2 {Pawn #1.} 10. Rb1 {The only reasonable move.} Qxc2 {Pawn #2.} 11. Nf3 {Again, the only reasonable move.  White now has to do some serious development fast.} Qf5 {I wanted to get my queen out of jeopardy.  If I hadn't taken her out now, Nh4 would have consumed the last two squares she could have used to escape.} 12. Nh4 {White wants to get my queen off the knight's and rook's backs.  Can't blame him.  Personally, though, I would have played g3.} Qf6 {My objective was to pressure the knight and defend the pawn.  It also sets up a discovered attack on the knight.  My plan was to roll out the black bishop next, probably to pin the knight.} 13. Nd5 {Another surprising move.  Were I playing white, I'd have played g3.  Instead, white tries to sucker me into the same king-rook fork that we danced around earlier.  The annoying part is that I don't have an easy way to shake the knight loose.} Qd6 {Abandoning my attack on the knight and retracing the queen's previous tour, I move the queen to defend c7 and attack the knight.  I'm not happy about it, though, because Qd6 blocks Bb4 .} 14. Qd2 {White defends his knight and lines up a beautiful queen-king skewer.} Nd4 {My two choices were Nd4 and Ne7.  Ne2 felt safer, but it further blocked in my bishop, and my goal was to pin the white queen.  Nd4 creates a lot of interesting possibilities, though, most of which end up with white being down a piece.  The safest thing for white to do is to retreat the knight to either c3 or e3, pinning my knight to my queen. We are now 14 moves into the game, and only two of my pawns have moved, while only one white pawn has moved.  The knights and queens are the only pieces that have actually seen play.  Out of 28 total moves, 11 of them have been queen moves and 9 of them have been knight moves.} 15. Qa5 {Instead of playing it safe, white chrages in, a move I didn't see coming.  This is a very interesting setup, because it looks really bad for black, when in reality, white is teatering on the edge of being mated.} b6 {The only response I have is b6.  Anything else allows Nc7 .  The only valid response is Rxb6.  Nxb6 gets Nc2  , Qxb6 ends up with white down a piece, and anything else loses the queen or the knight.  The only valid response to Rxb7 is axb6.  Anything else still allows Nc7 .} 16. Rxb6 axb6 17. Qxa8 Qc5 {With this move, I did three things.  Most importantly, I defended the bishop.  Without defense, the queen would rip through my entire back rank.  However, just a little defense is enough because white has so few pieces in play.  The second part of this move is continuing to pressure the knight.  That means that the queen is limited to only a few squares.  Last, but far from least, I threaten mate with Qc1  .  The best response is probably f3, opening up a bolt hole.} 18. f3 Nc2+ {I check white for two reasons: to prevent any hope of castling (not that there really was any) and to get the king out in the open.  My goal is check the white king enough that I can get my dark bishop into play, enabling me to castle my white bishop to safety.} 19. Kd2 Nb4 {Because of the placement of the white king, this move is a win no matter what happens.  If white responds with Nxb4, I get Qxb4 , starting a sequence that eventually frees my bishops.  If white responds with e4, choosing to defend the knight, either Nxd5 or Qc2  either results in trading off the queens (Qxd5, Qxd5) or freeing my bishops.  Doing neither loses the knight.} 20. Nxb4 Qxb4+ {My king is now no longer in any real danger.  The only worry is losing the bishop, which will be taken care of in the next few moves.} 21. Kc2 Qc4+ {Kc2 didn't leave me much room to steer the king where I wanted.  Coincidentally, though, the only valid check puts me in position to defend my light bishop while freeing my dark bishop.  After Bb4, white has to decide whether to defend the king or save the knight.  Meanwhile the white queen is forced to watch from the corner.} 22. Kd1 {Very nice move.  White once more takes away my control by positioning his king just out of reach.} Bb4 {The knight is still in danger, but the king is relatively safe for the moment.  The most reasonable response is Nf5, protecting the d4 square and threatening to bother my king.} 23. Nf5 g6 {With the white queen on the a8-h1 diagonal and the white knight guarding d4, my queen can no longer check the black king with a single move, which means that I can't take my queen off the c file.  Fortuantely, the white knight is easy to bump.} 24. e4 {Rather than move the knight [24. N?? Qd4  25. Kc2 Qc3  26. Kb1 Ba3], white chooses to attack my queen.  I think e3 would have been a much stronger move, but e4 serves the purpose.} Qc3 {Remaining on the c file, I advance my queen into mating position.  The only direct move that can prevent Qd2   is Qd5.} 25. Nd6+ {White sees the writing on the wall.  He sacrifices his knight to make me lose tempo, giving his king a chance to escape.  (If he hadn't made the sacrifice, we get: 25. Qd5 Qa1  26. Ke2 Qb2  27. Kd1 Bb7 28. Qd3 Ba6, leaving the queen with no way to continue to defend e7 against mate.)} Bxd6 {I didn't have much choice but to accept the sacrifice.  Ke7 takes the heat off my light bishop, but it leaves the white knight there to prevent my light bishop from participating in the king chase.  White managed to rob me of my chance for an early mate but paid for it by entering the end game materially disadvantaged. Fortunately for me, though, at this point white's only active piece is his queen.  My only real danger spot is my e pawn.  After Qd5, if my queen and bishop lose sight of my e pawn, white can steal my rook.  White's current worry is that moving his bishop off the first rank loses his remaining rook to Qa1 .} 26. Qd5 {White leaves me with the decision of whether to trade queens and slug it out in the end game (Qd4 ) , or to regroup and continue trying to catch the white king (Bb4).} Bb4 {Ultimately I decided to continue hounding the white king.  I figured that I would have the option of the queen trade for at least a couple more moves, and with only the queen in play, there isn't too much damange that white can do.  By resuming the bishop's post on b4, the white queen is forced to guard the d2 square.  The white bishop is locked down by the Qa1  threat.  The white rook is trapped.  The white king's only move is Ke2, which gets mate is a couple of moves.  The only moves white has at this point are pawns and Qd3. We're now 26 moves into the game, and still the queens and knights have dominated play.  Of the remaining pieces other than the queens, only two have moved: the white king and the black bishop.  That leaves 5 out of 9 pieces untouched, with 6 out of 11 pawns untouched.} 27. a3 {White tries to drag me off course again with another sacrifice.  This time, though, I have a choice.} Bb7 {Instead of taking the bait, I attack the white queen.  Because taking the queen off the c file results in mate, the queen has no recource but to retreat, Qd3.} 28. Qd3 Qa1+ {Now we begin a dance that will eventually lead to mate.} 29. Kc2 Qa2+ 30. Kd1 Ba6 {Again, the white queen cannot leave the c file, so her only choice is to run.} 31. Qc2 Qa1+ {We now begin a long dance that I hoped would give me a shot at a mate, but ended up just trading off the queens and bishops.} 32. Qc1 Qd4+ 33. Kc2 Qc3+ {I had to be careful here, because both of my bishops are in jeopardy.  I had to make sure that when the dance was over, Bxa3 (or Qxa3) would be the last step.} 34. Kb1 Qxc1+ {At this hope I gave up hope of avoiding the end game.} 35. Kxc1 Bxa3+ 36. Kc2 {I had to be careful here, because if the white rook got out, it could have skewered my bishops or my rook.} Bxf1 {No more bishop skewer.} 37. Rxf1 O-O {No more king/rook skewer.} 38. Ra1 {White's concern is now my passed b pawn.} Bc5 39. Ra7 {Not sure what white was trying to accomplish.} d6 40. Kc3 b5 {I use the fortunate positioning to advance by b pawn two ranks.} 41. Rb7 b4+ 42. Kb3 Ra8 {Now my objective is to get my rook over to the white g and h pawns.  If I can get a passed pawn on either side of the board, it's pretty much over.} 43. h4 {White split his g and h pawns to make them harder to chase down.} Ra3+ {This check was to bump the king so I could get my rook onto the second rank.} 44. Kc4 Ra2 {I'm really after the f pawn here, but first I have to chase off the g pawn.} 45. g4 Rf2 {The f pawn is now lost, opening the way for a second pawn charge, down the king-side.  In theory.} 46. h5 {White offered an innocuous pawn trade which turned out to be a nasty trap.  In considering my next move, I looked right at the trap but failed to recongnize it.} Rxf3 {Mistake of the game!  I was feeling a little too confident, and wasn't paying enough attention.  This move almost cost me the game.} 47. h6 {My king is now locked into the corner, waiting for Rb8  !  Even worse, white now has a shot at running his h pawn to the 8th rank.} f5 {I had to open up some room for my king.  I chose f5 instead of f6 for a couple of reasons.  First, white will not capture my f pawn.  Doing so would give me a nice opportunity to get my g pawn out from between my king and his h pawn.  Also, f5 gives my king more room to work, and the potential of opening the f file so I can send my rook to the rescue.  And at a minimum, it put's another pawn in the running for promotion.} 48. Rg7+ {It's amazing how being ill can affect one's mind.  The *obviously* correct response to this is Kh8.  Instead...} Kf8 {I chose Kf8?? Giving white an honest chance at promoting his pawn.} 49. exf5 {White captures my f pawn to get my g pawn out of his way.  Now that I have opened the door to promoting his pawn, the game has completely changed.} gxf5 {The best move here is probably g5, blocking off support for the h pawn.  Instead, my diseased mind found it better to capture.} 50. g5 {And now white is in a beautiful position.} b3 {Failing to notice that I'm about to lose the game, I decide to mak e a run for it with my b pawn.} 51. Rxh7 {At this point, it finally dawned on me that I might not be playing at my best.  Before I could do more damage, I stopping playing until I was well again.} Rg3 {After recovering, Rg3 was the only move left to me that left me a chance of winning.  Below are the non-draw alternatives. [51. ... Kg8 52. g6 b2 53. Rg7  Kf8 54. Rf7  Ke8 55. h7] [51. ... Kg8 52. Rg7  Kh8 53. g6 Rh3 54. Rh7  Kg8 55. Rg7  Kf8 56. Rf7  Ke8 57. h7] [51. ... Rh3 52. g6 b2 53. Rf7  Ke8 54. h7]} 52. Rb7 {I was very happy to see this move.  It meant that I had broken the charge of the h pawn.  Being up by a pawn of a bishop, I was very willing to trade passed pawns, especially considering my pawn-bishop pair and the fact that the white h pawn becomes a pain point for white.} Rxg5 {With a great sigh of relief, I captured the white pawn.  I thought it was all over.  I was wrong.} 53. Rb8+ {Doh!  Never saw it coming.  Not like I had much of a choice in any case.  I sealed my fate several moves ago.} Kf7 {I have to sit back and watch while I lose my rook.} 54. h7 Rh5 55. h8=Q Rxh8 56. Rxh8 b2 {OK.  So white has now evened up the game.  Things still looked good for me, though.  With four pawns, one on the 7th rank, and a bishop for support, my odds of promoting a pawn looked pretty good.} 57. Rb8 {This move surprised me.  I expected Rh1 to stop the queen until the king could move into postion to guard b1.  The advantage of this move over Rh1 is that white has bought an extra turn that he can use to go after my d pawn.  The disadvantage is that the rook can only defend one file.} Bd4 {I decided that it was more important to keep the pressure on with my b pawn than to save my d pawn.} 58. Kd5 {White moves in to threaten the d pawn and block my king's passage. } f4 {By advancing my f pawn, I rescued the d pawn.  If white captured the d pawn, my f pawn is a run-away.  At this point, the thing I was most worried about was white ability to burn moves by wiggling the rook.} 59. Rb3 {White makes another brilliant play.  He prepares to safely take my d pawn by guarding my f pawn.  If I make a run for it with the f pawn, white has the Zwischenzug, Rxf3 , which allows him to then return to guarding my b pawn before I can promote it.} Kg6 {I play wide, removing the Zwischenzug.  Ke4 is white's only move.  Anything else lets either the f pawn or the b pawn get away.} 60. Ke4 d5+ {For the same reason that white couldn't capture my d pawn before, he still can't now.  Same goes for Kd3.  White's only move is Kf3, driving the his king forward and allowing my pawns to advance.} 61. Kf3 Kf5 {I close in with my king to support the charge.  This is the point where I was finally certain that I had won.} 62. Kg2 {White decides to take control by moving the king instead of twiddling the rook and letting me check the king with e4.} e4 {White now has two choices: twiddle the rook or Kf1.  Kf1 is probably the better move because the rook creates a lot of pressure where it is.} 63. Rb7 f3+ {The pawn barrage marches onward.} 64. Kg3 {I think white was trying keep my king from moving in to support the pawns.} f2 {White is now hosed.  I have two pawns about to be promoted, and white has two pieces with which to stop them.  That means my king and remaining two pawns are free to roam.} 65. Kg2 {White has now other move.} e3 66. Kf1 {White brings his king around to the other side of the f pawn to block my king from providing support.} Ke4 67. Ke2 {Perfactly timed to move into opposition.} Bc3 {Unfortunately, white just has to sit back and watch while I bring the rest of my pieces into position.} 68. Rb8 {White twiddles the rook because he doesn't want to yield to my king.} d4 {I close the formation.  If white tries to check my king, he will work his way over to the b pawn and bring it home.  If not, then d3 , e2 , e1=Q .} 69. Re8+ {White opts to send my king travelling.} Kd5 70. Rb8 {White returns to guarding the b pawn.  The purpose of all this was to separate my king from my pawns.} d3+ {Because of that check, white has the option to capture either the e or d pawn.  Of course, it doesn't make any difference.} 71. Kxe3 {White, having reached the point of inevitability, resigns just before I can promote a pawn.}
