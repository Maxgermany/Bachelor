1. e4 {I liked open games at the time.} e5 {So did J. B.} 2. Nf3 {Always. I was anticipating a Ruy Lopez.} f6 {Looking back with 20 years of hindsight, not the best move J. B. could have played.} 3. Bc4 {Continuing to develop...} c6 {I'm guessing he intended 4...P-Q4, shutting off the Bishop.} 4. Nxe5 {What the hell, may as well be adventurous.} fxe5 {Of course, he retakes.} 5. Qh5+ {That infamous lightning-stroke, Q-R5 ch, shows up again.} Ke7 {5...P-N3 wouldn't help much... though it would have stopped the immediate checkmate. [5...P-N3 6 QxKP ch followed by 7 QxR would have supplied me with a winning material advantage.]} 6. Qxe5# {We barely sat down, and the game is over.}
