[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {This was a non rated, Sicilian Defense game for tutoring purposes, between my friend Ajay (grey_sparrow) and myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav).} c5 {So 1. e4 c5 marks the Sicilian Defense, a very tactical defense filled with potential for both sides.} 2. Bc4 {So Ajay, as you mentioned in one of your comments (now deleted due to comments posted afterward), you noticed on the openings website I sent you to, that the bishop is seldom brought out early in the Sicilian, and when it is, the results are not good for White. Here's why: In this early stage in the opening, you don't know what squares will be best for the bishops, and you know the knights are best on c3 & f3. The best squares for the bishops is determined by the pawn structure and the other pieces (especially pawns). So it is best to move the knights out, and see what develops in the pawns and pieces before moving the bishops. It turns out this was not the best square for the bishop. The consequences are evidenced in 2 ways: 1. I forced you to move the bishop a 2nd time, gaining development for me and losing it for you. 2. More important, after your later Qe2, the bishop had very little space to move to, so I cornered and slayed him (poor guy).} e6 {This is the Sicilian, Anderssen Variation.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 {After my knight move here, White has 4. e5, which appears at a glance to be strong, but then 4. ...d5! 5. Bb5+ Nd7 later followed by ...a6 and possibly ...b5.} 4. Nc3 d5 5. exd5 exd5 6. Qe2+ {(?) This is the move that blocked off your bishop, inviting an odd but strong 7th move on my part. He (the bishop) needed access to the a6-f1 diagonal. I demonstrated that the b3 and a4 squares were unsafe.} Be7 7. Bb5+ {(?) Although this move looks perfectly natural, I consider it to be a question mark move, due to the reasons stated in my next move.  The note above was previously input, but on reviewing again, I see you had no better choice here, since 7. Bb3 c4 8. Ba4+ Kf8 leads to the same line we played.} Kf8 {(!?) So conventional chess theory would say, "Block the check with the bishop or knight. Don't relinquish the right and privilege of being able to castle." I've never been one to hold to conventional theory. I am an innovator, always seeking out new ideas. In our previous game*, I stated "Every principle has some exceptions". I gave the example of a natural, man made law - to stop at a red light - which most people would violate if given the right circumstance. I made an imaginary scenario of you having an injured loved one in critical condition. There is no ambulance in your town, so you have to drive half an hour to the hospital. You may go through a red light or two. Similarly, chess principles are guidelines only - they should not be adhered to dogmatically.   Ajay, you may remember, I took several days to make this move, as I suggested to you at the beginning, "Analyze, Analyze, Analyze!". So here are my thoughts that brought about this strange move:   I. The bishop on b5 is restricted. The only square he can go to which "seems" safe is a4. I say seems because as we see, it is really deadly for the bishop. Moving to d3 is not safe as 8. ... c4 traps the bishop.   II. If I block the check with a knight or Bishop, then when I harass the bishop you can get him out of trouble by trading.  III. I can trap the bishop via:  A. 8. ... a6 followed by 9. ... b5 and 10. c4. B. If 8. a3 a6 9. Ba4 c4 still traps him. This is the line that was played.  IV. Although White gets the 1st move, in this position, he only has 4 development moves, while black has 5 development moves. So Ajay, do you know how to count development moves? If not, send me a note to say you need more info and I will explain. Until then, suffice to say that Black is ahead in development, while white has some compensation due to the Black king's position. I was planning on manually castling via g6, ... Kg7, ... Re8. On one hand. manually castling loses development because instead of 1 move to castle, it takes 4 moves on king-side castling (2 moves for the king, 1 pawn push and the rook move). On the other hand, I was already ahead in development and I was planning on forcing you to lose more development. (See point IV below.) So I felt manually castling was justified. I also had the prospect of winning your bishop (not yet forced). As it turned out I never did manually castle. I always saw a stronger move.  V. White can move his queen to make space for the bishop. Then if 8. ... a6, 9. Be2 (9. Bf1? would further impede his development). If he moves his queen, the queen only has 3 safe squares to go to: d1, f1 & e5 (8. Qe3? d4 forking the queen and knight).  A. If 8. Qd1 a6 9. Be2, you would be even further behind in development. You would only have 3 development moves, while Black has 5, plus it's Black's move, making it 6.   B. If 8. Qf1 a6 9. Be2, you are even further behind than example A, since your queen blocks you from Kingside castling.  C. If 8. Qe5, (See comment below)} 8. a3 {(?) You might have expected 8. ... a6 9. Ba4 b5 10. Bb3 c4 11. Ba2. While not winning the bishop, this would have seriously impeded your LSB. Yet the line I played was stronger: 8. a6 9. Ba4 c4, the move you stated was a surprise! It's important in chess to look at what I call "crazy moves". It's the moves that are ridiculously outlandish, that are frequently the best! For example, in this game: 7. ...Kf8! & 9. ... c4! (especially Kf8).  For more on "crazy moves" study the games of masters such as Bobby Fischer and José Raúl Capablanca. To make some of the moves they made, they definitely would have seemed insane. But the analysis that followed proved they were solid moves.} a6 9. Ba4 c4 {There is the move! Your bishop is trapped (though not yet attacked, you know it's coming and he has no escape)!} 10. d3 {This move somewhat opens the line up to your king so that if you choose to give up the knight instead of the bishop, I can play Qa5+, winning both pieces, (actually what happened)! You will lose the bishop regardless, so you'd be better off castling. I would not necessarily put a question mark by 10. d3, since capturing with the knight is what really opened you up, (since I can't check you with the knight there). } b5 11. Nxb5 {(???) Now the question mark. On every move, think, "Can he attack me in any way? Can he check me?" You may have thought that on your last move, I don't know. But scenarios change every move you make. Remember, as opposed to OTB Chess, you have days (or in the case of this game, 2 weeks!) to make each move. That's a lot of time, so take the time to think it through!} axb5 12. Bxb5 Qa5+ 13. Bd2 Qxb5 {So now I have 2 minor pieces in exchange for 2 pawns! Definitely a won game for Black.} 14. O-O Nc6 {My goal now is to gain development as quickly as possible, instead of getting greedy with 14. ...Qxb2 15. Rfb1 Qxc2 16 Ne1 Qa4.} 15. Rfe1 Bg4 16. h3 Bxf3 {Removing your knight on f3 enables my knight to go to d4, forking the queen on f3 and the pawn on c2. You can't afford to sacrifice the c2 pawn because the knight would be forking your rooks. Thus your queen has to retreat to the passive d1, leaving the d3 pawn undefended.} 17. Qxf3 Nd4 18. Qd1 cxd3 19. cxd3 Nb3 {I could have taken the d-pawn here but I felt the Knight move was stronger. It attacks the rook and, more importantly, prevents the rook from moving to the opened c file.} 20. Rb1 Qxd3 21. Re2 Nxd2 {It is only to my advantage to trade, as once everything is traded off, then I bring my king and latent h8 rook into the game.} 22. Rxd2 Qf5 23. Rc1 Ne4 24. Re2 Bc5 25. Rcc2 Ra6 26. Rxe4 Bxf2+ 27. Rxf2 Qxe4 28. Re2 Qf5 29. Qc1 Ra8 30. b4 d4 31. Qc4 d3 32. Rf2 Rc8 {Again, with this move, I'm trying to trade stuff off, but you resigned. Ajay, once again, it's been my pleasure.}
