1. d4 d5 2. c4 {I play the Queen's Gambit, one of my favorite openings.} Nf6 {Generally considered inferior because after I take his pawn with my c pawn, I will be able to attack whichever piece retakes it with, either by playing e2-4 or Nc3.} 3. Bg5 {? I should have taken his pawn for the reasons given last move. I was a little distracted at the start of the match, and missed this.} dxc4 4. e3 Ne4 5. Bf4 g5 {I don't really like this move. Although it chases my bishop, it opens up his kingside.} 6. Be5 f6 {Makes the kingside even more vulnerable.} 7. Bg3 Nxg3 {When he played this move I remember thinking that I would not have played this because it opens up the h file for my rook. This actually proves important later in the game.} 8. hxg3 Bg7 9. Bxc4 {Maybe I should have played Qh5+ here?} e6 {Cutting down on my bishop's diagonal} 10. Nc3 O-O {It seems like a very bad idea to castle kingside as my h rooks file is open and he has already moved the pawns defending his king.} 11. Qc2 {Prepares for queenside castling. It also threatens Qxh7+, but this threat is so obvious I was very surprised when he missed it.} Nc6 {??} 12. Qxh7+ Kf7 13. d5 Ne5 14. dxe6+ Bxe6 15. Bxe6+ {After he retakes, his bishop on g7 will fall to my queen.} Kxe6 16. Qxg7 Nd3+ {Black looks to get some counterplay.} 17. Kf1 {Moving to d1 would allow a discovered check.} Nxb2 18. Nf3 {Bringing another piece into the attack} Qd3+ 19. Ne2 {And here my knight will stay for the rest of the game, shielding my king from the black queen.} Nc4 {I'm not sure what this move is trying to accomplish} 20. Nfd4+ {The king hunt resumes.} Kd5 21. Qd7+ Nd6 22. Qe6+ Kc5 23. Rc1+ {My rook joins in.} Nc4 {That black knight is doing a very good job shielding his king.} 24. Nb3+ Kb4 25. a3+ {In retrospect, this seems to be a bad move. He can't take my knight because Rc3+ would win his queen, but my pawn will fall. I played this move quickly without thinking.} Nxa3 26. Nbd4 b6 {I have no idea what this move accomplishes, but it allows me to play Nc6+} 27. Nc6+ Ka4 {His king is driven against the wall} 28. Qg4+ Kb5 29. Qb4+ Ka6 30. Qa4+ Kb7 {Now his king hides and I am unable to get to him.} 31. f4 {I plan on unpinning my knight and connecting my rooks with Kf2.} b5 {But then he plays this. Although it appears good, chasing my queen, it allows my knight to resume the assault.} 32. Na5+ Kb6 {I wonder if he might have been better off with Kc8} 33. Qb4 {Now black is in trouble. I am threatening Rc6#. I can see several ways for him to at least delay this fate, but they all seem to involve him losing material. I believe his best move here would be Nc4. Then I would play Nxc4+, and while he would still be under attack, at least mate would not be immediate.} Qxe3 {Unfortunately for him, he takes my pawn...} 34. Rc6# {Allowing my rook to deliver the final blow! I hope you enjoyed this game. It was very fun to play. If you noticed any mistakes on my part, please leave a comment.}
