[Opening "King's gambit (C30)"]

1. e4 {Here we start, my favorite opening. According to me, lots of aggressive and robust game lines initiate with 1.e4. If black chooses, 1.d4 lines would be either much aggressive or much closed. With time control, one should need very high strategic powers and accuracy to play latter lines.} e5 {And there's my favorite response for a quick game. IMO, one of those best responses for 1.e4.} 2. f4 {King's Gambit, either accepted or declined, a fiery game is guaranteed. White doesn't have a clear cut win, but for both, the game board is no less risky than 'walking on a minefield', one slip would do a massive damage.} d6 {Declined, 2...Nc6 or 2...d5 would be other lines for a ferocious game.} 3. fxe5 {Probably a mistake, let me have a chance to justify this move as a sudden experiment. Just after a fraction of a second after this move, I just recognized a storm that was about to come.} dxe5 {Much better than I expected, as per my thinking the best reply was the 'post-anticipated' summon of the queen with 3...Qh4+.} 4. Nf3 {A centered horse prevents further threats from Qh4 and exerts pressure on the undefended pawn on e5, which is the only black piece on center.} h6 {A completely unnecessary move to the position, as the whole battle was around the center, 4...Bd6 or 4...Nc6 would be better alternatives.} 5. Nxe5 {Captured an obvious looking pawn, but with a little bit of analysis, there's not an extra pawn, but an advanced position near the center.} Qe7 {"Retreat your horse and let us capture that arrogant soldier". The opponent was targeting at the pawn on e4.} 6. d4 {"Not so fast, you should work on it"! Yes, I believe that it was not that good move. 6...Nc6 would bring good perspectives for black's middle game. This was a battle of the time more than rambling for pawns at that moment. So I just tried to push pawns around the center.} f5 {He was trying to create pressure on those pieces, by the way, I was hoping this move from an earlier time. My actual expected move was 6...f6.} 7. Qh5+ {Due to the well placed knight, 7...Kd7 was impossible and 7...Qf7 was a mate in 2. Only possibility was 7...Kd8.} Kd8 {Forced move for the situation, the immediate results of other alternatives are discussed in the previous section.} 8. Nf7+ {Applying more pressure, it was an annoying fork. Despite of the discovered check, I might played 8...Ke8, but the game went as...} Kd7 {...} 9. Qxf5+ {While doing this move, the only things I noticed were 9...Kc6 10.Qb5# and 9...Qe6 10.Qxe6+ Kxe6 11.Nxh8 +-.} Ke8 {It would be a rapid try to attack the queen, capture the horse and save the hanging rook on h8.} 10. Qxc8+ {More and more destruction made by those two pieces. Only alternatives are 10...Qd8 (11.Qxd8 Kxf7 11.Qxc7+ followed by 12.Qxb7 and 13.Qxa8) and...} Kxf7 {One rook was saved and it took around 10 seconds for the last move I did.} 11. Qxb7 {And that was the moment I sighed and rested for a little while after I got to know that I've 'smothered' his other rook and provided adequate protection to the e4 pawn. (By this moment, his clock had 51 seconds where mine had 37).} Nc6 {And there, the white queen is in dilemma. The rook or the knight, as both were complementary material.} 12. Qxc6 {Avoiding from thinking twice, the knoght was the selected target. If the rook was captured, the e pawn was en prise and the game would go as 12.Qxa8 Qxe4+ 13.Kd1 Qxd4+ 14.Bd2 Qd7. In this case, the material looks alike as taking the knight, besides the queen is cornered on a8 and need a couple of more moves for 'reactivation'.} Rd8 {A desperate attempt to save the rook and to create some threat. } 13. Bc4+ {And this was the two before to the checkmating move. The opponent resigned at the spot and the hurricane was over in favor of white.}
