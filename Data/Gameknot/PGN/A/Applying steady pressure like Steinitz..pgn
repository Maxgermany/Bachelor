[Opening "Caro-Kann (B11), two knights, 3...Bg4"]

1. e4 c6 {Ah, the Caro-Kann, a favourite of Karpov's... and of mine when I was at university.} 2. Nc3 {d4 is normal but both Nc3 and c4 are better suited to blitz games.} d5 3. Nf3 {Again d4 is standard.} Bg4 {dxe4 is another option.} 4. h3 Bxf3 {Bh5 is also playable.} 5. Qxf3 e6 {Nf6 is another choice.} 6. d4 {d3 is possible.} dxe4 {Nf6 is probably better. However dxe4 (a rare continuation) was played by World Champion Max Euwe in Venice in 1948 and he went on to win in 25 moves. It was also played in Smyslov - Chandler (1981), a draw in 38 moves.} 7. Qxe4 {Follows the Smyslov - Chandler game, but Nxe4 looks better.} Nf6 8. Qd3 {Continues to follow Smyslov - Chandler. Qe3 might be better. } Bb4 {Leaves Smyslov - Chandler, which continued with the quieter Nbd7. Bb4 is a natural move, developing the bishop and allowing 0-0.} 9. Bg5 {Maybe Be2, also allowing 0-0, is better.} O-O {Qa5 looks an interesting possibility here.} 10. a3 Bxc3+ {Be7 certainly looks better. Now it will be a classic battle of knights v. bishops! White, however, is behind in development.} 11. bxc3 {White returns the favour, playing a poor move. Opening a line here seems pointless, even with Black's queen's bishop off the board. The obvious Qxc3 is better. } Nbd7 12. Be2 Qa5 {The only option. h6 is too passive.} 13. Bd2 Rad8 14. O-O Nc5 {Black is using his advanced development to push for an advantage and force white's pieces to retreat. } 15. Qc4 {Qe3 looks better.} Nce4 {Forcing the bishop to retreat even further.} 16. Be1 Qc7 {Switching the focus to the king's side} 17. Bf3 Ng5 {b5 looks attractive but weakens the pawn structure and could give white's rook scope on the b-file for a counterattack.} 18. Qe2 {Signs the execution papers for his own bishop. Be2 is better.} Nxf3+ {Playing c5 directly is an option.} 19. Qxf3 c5 20. Rb1 {Looks a natural move but it is easily refuted. 20.dxc5 Qxc5 21.Qxb7 is better.} b6 {Blocking off any hopes of a counter. 20. ... cxd4? hands the advantage to white after 21.Rxb7 Qc8 22.cxd4} 21. dxc5 Qxc5 22. Rb4 a5 {Nd5 is playable.} 23. Rb3 b5 {Removing a possible target for White's bishop.} 24. Qg3 {Qf4 looks better.} Qc4 {Blocking the advance of white's weak doubled pawns.} 25. Qg5 {Pointless and easily refuted. White is running out of ideas. Possible was 25.f3 preventing Ne4.} Rd5 26. Qc1 {Another retreat. Qe3 was better.} Rc8 27. Bd2 {Highlighting white's passivity.} Ne4 28. Be3 {Retreating back to e1 is just too depressing.} Nxc3 {The dam is starting to crack....} 29. Kh1 {And now it bursts completely. White throws in the towel. Qa1 was the only option.} Rcd8 30. Rg1 Rd5d1 31. Qb2 {The only way to try and survive the onslaught is 31.Rxc3 Rxc1 32.Rxc4 Rxg1  33.Kxg1 Rd1  34.Kh2 bxc4 35.Kg3} Rxg1+ 32. Kxg1 {32.Kh2 leads to mate in 4: 32. ... Qf1 33.Kg3 Qxg2  34.Kh4 g5  35.Bxg5 Qxg5 mate.} Qf1+ {A decisive move which breaks any final resistance. } 33. Kh2 {If 33.Kxf1 Rd1 checkmate!} Ne2 {Threatening Qg1 mate.} 34. h4 {Mate in 4 is now certain. Qb1 was one last desperate chance to resist the inevitable, but fails after 34. ... Rd1, forcing the exchange of the queen for the rook.} Qg1+ 35. Kh3 Qh1+ 36. Kg4 Qxg2+ 37. Kh5 Qg6# {If I may be so bold, this game reminds me of the style of applying steady pressure indicative of Steinitz, whose games I was studying at the time.}
