1. e4 {Here's an entertaining battle that swings one way then another, mainly due to our mistakes rather than cleverness.  Enjoy!} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bd3 {A relatively rare response to the Najdorf.  This bishop usually adopts a more attacking posture on c4 or prepares to occupy the long diagonal with B-e2-f3.  On d3, it's blocked in by the pawn on e4 and not actually attacking anything.  The main line of the Najdorf continues with 6. Bg5 and extremely complex theoretical battles.  I started a Najdorf tournament at the same time as this one and in one game we're still in the book at move 17 ...} e5 {especially after this move prevents the e4 pawn from moving.  The drawback to this move is the weakening of d5.} 7. Nf3 {and the drawback of this is that it prevents White from playing a quick f4, the most direct route to attacking Black's centre.  7. Ne2 or 7. Nb3 or 7. Nf5 are preferable in my view.} Bg4 {So I've been provoked into an unusually active move with my QB.  After 6...e5, this B normally heads straight for e6.} 8. h3 Bh5 {preferring to maintain the pin than to release the tension by swapping a good B for White's N.} 9. g4 {White is provoked in turn...} Nxg4 {and so is Black again!  I'm determined to play aggressively rather than tamely retreat the B to g6 where it would lead a miserable existence.} 10. hxg4 Bxg4 {So Black has two pawns for a B and an annoying pin on White's N.  White's Kingside is in ruins but Black has yet to castle and has a gaping hole at d5.  The scene is set for more fireworks.} 11. Be3 {A good developing move by White, attacking the hole at b6 and preparing queenside castling.} Be7 12. Rg1 {attacking the annoying bishop...} Bxf3 {which has now to swap for White's N, else the g7 pawn is lost for nothing.} 13. Qxf3 Nd7 {With the open files in front of Black's kingside position, Black doesn't want to castle into a barrage by White's heavy artillery, hence the delay in castling... But have I forgotten about my pawn on g7?} 14. Rxg7 Bf6 {immediately attacking the intruder} 15. Bg5 {to my surprise, White pins the B against Black's Q, a tactic I'd overlooked.  It is in these complicated looking positions that I tend to blunder pieces left right and centre....} h5 {I don't fall for 15 ... Bxg5 16. Qxf7#, nor 15....Bxg7 16. Bxd8.  Instead, I launch my passed pawn.  How far will it get?} 16. Nd5 {Now I'm in trouble, surely!  White occupies the hole on d5 with telling effect.  The B is attacked by three pieces and only defended by two.  If it moves, mate follows on f7, or does it?} Bxg7 {I think this was the only move.} 17. Bxd8 Rxd8 {I'm down by a Queen for a Rook and a Pawn.} 18. O-O-O Rc8 {to prevent 19. Nc7+ Ke7 (19...Kf8? 20. Ne6+!)} 19. Be2 {preparing a discovered attack on d6} h4 20. Rh1 {The pawn must be stopped} Bh6+ {the check allows time to bolster its defence and retain cover of f6} 21. Kd1 Bg5 22. Qg4 Bd8 {not 22...Nf6 23. Qxc8#} 23. Qg7 Rf8 24. Rxh4 {? Presumably he forgot about the B on d8.} Bxh4 25. Bh5 Rc4 {Time to counter-attack!} 26. f3 b5 27. Bg4 {threatening to remove the Rf8's defence} Nc5 {leaping from defence to attack, though Black has no obvious specific threats at present} 28. Qh7 Bg5 29. Qf5 {again threatening check on c8, as well as the B on g5} Ne6 {dealing with both those threats simultaneously} 30. c3 Rh8 {Now the defending Rook threatens to attack down the open h file} 31. Bh3 a5 {hoping to advnace the b-pawn and attack with R and B } 32. Nb6 {attacking the Rook before Black can fulfil his plan} Rc7 {maintaining control of the c-file and reinforcing the defence of the White squares around the King} 33. Nd5 Rc4 {as you were ...} 34. Ke2 {Quite rightly, White isn't ready to settle for a draw yet.} b4 35. b3 Rxc3 {giving up the exchange for an advanced passed pawn} 36. Nxc3 Nd4+ {oh - I forgot to mention the true motivation: the fork of the King and Queen (not possible while the pawn was on c3)!} 37. Kd3 Nxf5 38. Bxf5 bxc3 39. Kxc3 {The dust clears and Black is a whole rook up.  Now he just has to avoid blunders ...} Ke7 40. Kc4 Rh2 41. a4 Rb2 42. Bg4 Rc2+ 43. Kd3 Rc5 44. Bf5 Kf6 {and White gave up.  It's a hopeless position for him even though there are no obvious immediate threats from Black.}
