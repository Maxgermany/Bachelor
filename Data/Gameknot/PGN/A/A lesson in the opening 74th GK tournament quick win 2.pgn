1. e4 {A common move for white.} e5 {A common move for black.} 2. Nf3 {A common 2nd move for white.} f6 {This is where the lesson begins. This is a o.k move for black. White will show the consequences of this move if black plays poorly.} 3. Nxe5 {White took advantage of black's "f6". For those who do not know, the white knight can't be taken OR ELSE.  A good move for black now is Qe7 which will regain the pawn.} fxe5 {And the game is already over if white knows what to do. In this case, white knew.} 4. Qh5+ {A very good move. g6 is horrible (Not the song) because it would lose the rook and a pawn after Qxe5+. Black's only "good" option is to move the king.} Ke7 {--} 5. Qxe5+ {Good play by white.} Kf7 {--} 6. Bc4+ {Still good play by white.} Kg6 {--} 7. Qf5+ {Before the bloodbath would begin, black resigned. Remember that this was played in the casual section of the tournament. Once again, great play by white.}
