1. d4 Nf6 2. e3 {This move never fail to take out of my ground (the clubbish Budapest). It transposes into so many other well studied "serious" lines I'm not familiar with (and I should!). } e6 {I've tried the obvious b6, in order to fiachetto the lsb. But white players are normally well aware of it and manage to have it blinded by my own d5, which has to be played in most lines. } 3. Bd3 {I would never play this as white, but I know that h7 will be targeted sooner or later. } c5 {Probably there are alternate moves, but this seems to me almos forced for black, if not now, at some point. } 4. c3 {This is MY favourite asset with white pieces (but for the B)... and I use to win with it!} Nc6 5. f4 {Uh, oh! My opponent is playing seriously. My "normal developement" Nc6, carelessly played, probably costed me a strong attack on the kingside!} d5 {The best way to control f5 (Ne7 I wouldn't dare without solid knowledge). Anyway, as white I would have played g4 at once (now that I can). } 6. Nf3 {Fortunately, my opponent is more focused in castling than in attacking. I don't know if he's right, but I would have gone for attack. } Be7 {I don't like to move this B, since after dxc4 it has to move again. But I was a little scared. Now I think that cxd had to be played, and the N exchanged in order to counterattack him, instead of this "normal developement" move. } 7. Nbd2 {Again, my opponent is more focused in developing than in exploit my weaknesses. This is a good move, of course, but it is not aiming at my "mistakes". } a6 {I plan to pawnstorm on the Qside, if white doesn't attack soon. Again, cxd would have been better, but let's say that is not a bad thing to keep it for whenever I want. True is that now W playing 8. dxc, Bxc4, 9. b4 had won tempo, but hey: white's e3 is hanging! Of course, I won't, ever, castle here: it's asking for troubles! Bd7 instead supports the b5 advance in another way: I'll have to take out of the way Nc6, probably with Na7 or Na5... I'm at a loss, in a board completely different from the ones I normally play. } 8. Ne5 {My, what a poor attack white is performing! } Nxe5 {Smplify, simplify...} 9. dxe5 Ne4 10. Nxe4 dxe4 11. Bxe4 {I'm a pawn under, but white has no more advantage that the good B, which can be managed by me in two easy moves. If white does not creates interferences with his Q. I have nothing on h4+, and if I want to recover the pawn I'll have to play aggresively. The white Q is too dangerous, for example on g4, to be allowed. } Qxd1+ 12. Kxd1 {Aaaahhhh.... relax! Now, castling is not my priority, either. It is to neutralize the B on the diagonal. } Rb8 {Thanks that the Wdsb is stucked in by pawns, his position is no better than mine. This will go into a draw, which I will accept (he is more rated than me). } 13. Ke2 b5 {"Pawnstorming" :-)} 14. Bd2 {I thought that c4 was not good, since after b3 white manages to activate his B. But I also had memories of a game in which...} f6 {I have to do this, working for the activation of my lsb and not simply exchanging for him. I'm still a pawn down, I have to prove it's a draw. And fair exchanges don't favour me, while pawn's do. } 15. exf6 {I was now on a dilemma. Bxf6 isolates a pawn and activates some play against the black diagonal pointing to Ra1. But, at the same time, I felt that this pressure won't go anywhere, because of white will get a scope for his dsb. So I preferred to keep white closed in, and play with with the semi-opened resulting g column. My best result will be to play the e pawn without allowing f5 in response. I need to be patient.} gxf6 {Now, to free the way for my lsb I have to play, very counterintuitively, f5, defend it with my R and play e5. If I go e5 now, white will reply with f5 and my lsb will languish, being his best to be exchanged. } 16. Rhd1 {Wrong R, white!} e5 {...but didn't I just said...? Yes. But now the situation has changed. Now I can use the g column to make pressure on white.} 17. Bc6+ {Not a good move. But I have to avoid further checks and take advantage of his misplaced lsb. } Kf8 {No checks. No R penetration by White. Bg4+ threatened. What I need connected R for, right now?} 18. e4 {White plans f5, or fxe5, but if he hopes I'll fall for exf4?? he's wrong.} Bg4+ 19. Ke3 {This "must" be wrong, I sensed. Then I asked myself why. Then I found the answer. And played...} c4 {The exchange is assured, because white has a mate net, and he has only ONE move to save his K, which is Kf2. (well, no: he had 20. Be1 (...Bc5+, 21. Kd2 forced and black has nothing better than BxR - and I doubt I would have played it, since Bd4 by white would have sealed the draw) and ... b4! was the other one, but black would have won the exchange and maybe more). } 20. Rde1 {No, my dear, not this one. This is the worst of all. And I started the game so "scared", and then I was just about offer a draw... instead of this, I had some tactic vision to apply to a very nice position. } Bc5# {Take this! So you play more concentrated next time! :-)}
