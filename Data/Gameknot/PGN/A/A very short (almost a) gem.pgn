1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 c5 4. c4 {I have to confess that I am at loss, since I nevery play this kind of game (very usual) with white pieces. So I was improvising, trying not to fall in stupid tricks. } cxd4 5. exd4 Bb4+ {This is much more I use to play! In my beloved Budapes, though, I have no central pawns, with lots of useful lines for attack.} 6. Nc3 Ne4 {Even better. I make pressure on white, and force him into my game.} 7. Bd2 {I can choose: NxB is ok if I want to save my own dsb, but I can also exchange it for the N in order to clear some ways.} d5 {This could have been a mistake. Now white can take NxN, and I almost lose a piece. dxN (if BxN+, NxB and I am a piece under!), BxB, exNe3, Qxe3. } 8. cxd5 {My opponent chooses to free the way for his lsb to b5.} exd5 9. Ne5 {Well played, since it makes Bb5+ more dangerous.} Bxc3 {I saw a way to revert the possible pressure. White could have tried Nxf7, with known and uncertain results. I'll threat first. } 10. Bxc3 Qf6 {White is forced to care for f2, and if he does properly, the game will come out even enough to be long and drawn. } 11. f3 {?? but if he helps me like this, he makes me think I know how to play this game, which is not true. } Qh4+ 12. Ke2 {If g3, Nxg3, of course. Not necessarily winning, but nice to play. Now the obvious one was Ng3+, winning the exchange. But... what about...} Qf2+ 13. Kd3 {Ok, now I knew I could have just trapped myself into a dead way, but I just needed one more attacker to get mate. Which is it, and which is the only right way to bring it in? Please, stop the video... :-D} b6 {I think there is nothing white can do... it was a lucky move, but I am proud of have found it, and also its elegance. } 14. fxe4 Ba6+ 15. Nc4 Bxc4# {If I wanted to create such a position for a tactic excercise, I could have lost half of my life! :-) Thanks to my opp!}
