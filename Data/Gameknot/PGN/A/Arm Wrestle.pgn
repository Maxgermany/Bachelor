[Opening "French (C04), Tarrasch, Guimard main line"]

1. e4 e6 {French Defence.  A long time favourite of mine in OTB play.} 2. d4 d5 {Black's standard challenge to White's claim upon the centre.} 3. Nd2 {The Tarrasch variation, in my view the most difficult line for Black to meet.  Also popular are 3.Nc3 (Classical) and 3.e5 (Advance variation).} Nc6 {[!?]  Guimard Variation.  This used to be my stock response to White's 3rd move, and  I had a lot of success with it, even against strong opposition.  I did not use it to initiate piece play by a central break ...e5, but to play lines more akin to Owen's Defence, combined with a slower breakout with ...f6.  The fact is, though, that there is a bit of a down side to 3...Nc6, in that it blocks the thematic ...c5 pawn break.  This was not helped by my clumsy handling of the line during the next few moves.} 4. Ngf3 {Develops, and protects the d-pawn at the same time.} Nf6 {Attacks e4, and induces the pawn's advance.} 5. e5 Nd7 {Most circumspect and probably best, though it does make bit of a problem out of the c8-bishop.  5...Ne4 is possibly playable, but it is not a move I would be happy to contemplate in this type of position.} 6. Nb3 {Possibly the most 'natural' move is 6.c3, but for some reason, this knight move has long been regarded as the strongest.  Personally, I don't think there is all that much in it.} a5 {This was a new move for me - not conceptually, as I  used to play it quite a lot, but never so early.  I don't think I'll be in such a mad rush to repeat this experiment.  Better would have been ...Be7 or ...f6.} 7. a4 {To keep the knight snug on b3.} f6 {Afterwards I felt that this should have waited one more move, in favour of ...Be7.} 8. Bb5 {A good development that exploits Black inability to strike at it by ...a6.  The threat is to exchange at the moment White considers most propitious, and, apart from the unappealing ...Na7, Black can't do much about it.} Be7 {As White omitted to exchange on f6, an alternative well worth thinking about was 8...fxe5 9.dxe5 ... (9.Nxe5 Ncxe5 10.dxe5 c6 would have been great for Black) 9...Be7 10.Nbd4 Ndb8  11.0-0 0-0 12.c3 Bd7 and Black's game looks reasonable enough.} 9. exf6 Bxf6 {[?] What was I thinking?!  The knight recapture simply had to be the better option.  I think I might have had the ...e5 break in mind, but that was never going to happen.} 10. O-O O-O 11. Re1 {The e-pawn is under attack - what can be done about it?  Maybe I ought to have carried on, for better or for worse, 11...e5!? 12.Bxc6 bxc6  13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.dxe5 Be7, but the position doesn't look very comfortable.  Another idea might have been 11...Re8  12.Bf4 Na7  13.Bd3 Nc6.  Instead, I tried to revivify my game - and redress my earlier mishandling -  with a pawn sacrifice.  Had I thought this through more, I might well have chosen differently.} Be7 {[!] This probably did not deserve to turn out as well as it did, but for the cost of a pawn, Black's pieces became very active.} 12. Rxe6 Nf6 13. Re1 {The move I expected, and probably best.  But White could have contemplated a an exchange sacrifice, here, with 13.Rxc6!? bxc6 14.Bxc6 Ra7 15.Ne5 ... with plenty of activity to offset the slight material imbalance.} Ne4 {At the cost of a pawn, Black's game doesn't look so bad, now.  But a pawn's a pawn fo' a' tha'.} 14. Be3 {14.c3 was a good alternative.} Bg4 {?! Possibly 14...Bd6 ought to have been played first.} 15. Be2 {Breaks the pin, but more importantly, prevents an exchange that would have scrambled White's K-side.  Now there is no question of Bxc6 to break up Black's Q-side.} Bd6 {This seemed very natural, but maybe ...Qe8, with ...Qh5 in mind, merited consideration.} 16. Nc5 {This looks good, and brings a rather aloof knight back into the action.  Once again, 16.c3, to reinforce the centre, might have been considered.  } Nxd4 {!?  At the time, I thought this a fine move to bring Black back to an approximate equality, or only a very slight minus.  The Gameknot Engine calls this a mistake: 16â€¦ Nxd4 17. Nxb7 Nxe2+ 18. Rxe2 Qe8 19. Qxd5+ Kh8 20. Bd4 Bxf3 21. gxf3 Nf6 22. Qb5 Qxb5 23. axb5 Rae8 24. Rxe8 Nxe8 with a nigh-on winning end game for White.  But Black might have done better (after 17.Nxb7) with 17...Nxf3ch! and whether White takes with pawn or bishop, 18...Bxh2ch! keeps Black in the game.  To maintain an edge, maybe White would have to retreat 19.Kf1.  This is all very well: during the game I barely glanced at the 17.Nxb7 line.  However, I could have looked at alternatives such as 16...Bxc5 or 16...Qe8.} 17. Bxd4 Nxc5 {!  from here on comes a wild melee of exchanges that wipes out most of the active pieces on both sides, and leaves White with the slenderest of margins.} 18. Bxg7 {! Well played.  I would have been very pleased had White played 18.Bxc5 instead.  Black would have at least an equal game - maybe even an edge.} Bxf3 {!  Best, I think.  18...Kxg7 19.Qd4ch Qf6  20.Qxg4ch doesn't look so bad for Black, but the pawn margin would have persisted with not much that Black could show for it.} 19. Bxf8 Bxe2 {Forced, as taking the f8-bishop would have left Black the exchange down and a lost game.} 20. Qxd5+ {A tempo-gaining capture that for the two minor pieces, White obtains a rook and TWO pawns.  Instead, 20.Rxe2 Kxf8 =.} Kxf8 21. Qf5+ {!  Excellent move, avoiding a nasty threat.  After 21.Rxe2?? Bxh2ch would have been winning for Black.} Kg7 {Black plans to offer the exchange of queens.} 22. Rxe2 Qf6 {Marking the end of the middle game phase, and beginning the 'early end game' phase.  Almost 70 moves remain to this game, and it might even have been longer, but keep reading.  There will be further points of interest along the way...} 23. Qxf6+ {There was no compelling reason for White to go along with this exchange (e.g. 24.Qg4ch was playable), but no particular reason not to, either. } Kxf6 {Now, with White to play, the game enters a whole new phase.  Time to pause and reflect.  White has rook and two pawns for bishop and knight.  According to the standard scale of values, White is a pawn ahead, but practice indicates that (R+2) and (B+N) are close to equal.  For the moment White has no real weaknesses, though c2 is likely to become one.  It can't really be said Black has any, neither.  White has a 3-1 majority on the K-side, the pawns are level, and the f-pawn is 'passed' - Black can stop its promotion only with pieces or the king.  This sounds good for White, but there is a down side: White will have to look to the K-side only to make progress, unless he can induce a vulnerable weakness on the other wing.  Black's advantage is in the flexibility - handiness - of his pieces.  Bishop, knight and rook work pretty well together.  I assess the game here as roughly level.  Maybe White has a whisker of an edge, but no more.  On the other hand, both sides have plenty to play for, for now. } 24. b3 {Tidies up the Q-side a bit so that the a1-rook can move.} Rd8 {Centralising.  This placement is fairly arbitrary, but opens the possibility of seizing the file outright by ...Be5.  Also possible were ...Rf8 or ...Rg8, as equally active posts.} 25. g3 {To make any progress at all, White has to do something with his major trumps: his majority and the passed pawn.  This move prepares the advance of the f-pawn.} Ne6 {The advance of the g-pawn does come at the cost of leaving weaknesses that Black might try and exploit.  This knight move eyes ...Nd4 with attacks on c2 and f3.  They aren't much, but White isn't giving much away.} 26. Rd1 {Partly to place a half-pin on the bishop, preventing ...Bc5, but also to prevent ...Nd4.  Black's options are fairly limited at the moment.} b6 {Taking time out also to tidy up the Q-side.  A useful 'waiting' move to see how White will proceed.  Note that now the bishop has sanctuaries on d6, c5 and b4, which could prove useful.} 27. Kg2 {Cagily giving nothing away, and keeping it tight.  Around now I was thinking that this game was going to end in a draw.  I felt that I could hold, but that winning chances for Black were approximately nil.} Rg8 {Probing, but also with the idea of bringing the rook to the 5th rank (...Rg5), where it can probe more effectively by moving along the rank unimpeded by his own pawns and pieces.} 28. Re4 {White has a similar idea, by the look!} Rg5 29. f4 {Had White played 29.Rh4, I had intended 29...h5.  Normally when defending with pawn(s) minus, I prefer to keep them right back on their own rank or maybe 'up one', where they are strongest and most easily defended.  But I felt that in this game that won't do.  The h-pawn will be used to try and break up White's K-side, or at least make them easier to blockade.  That will require its exchange it the right moment.  As it transpired, the career of the Black h-pawn was to take an unexpected turn, later on.} Rc5 {Attacking c2, the weak spot...} 30. Rd2 {Good: defending from an active post.  White is still presenting few targets for Black to aim at.  For the moment, White is engaged in a close-order advance whilst Black tries to snipe at any target that presents itself.  Can White bash a way through?} Rh5 {h2 is not much of a target in itself, but I simply didn't like the look of ...Rc6.  For the moment Black's minor pieces are busy closing off the central files, so choices remain limited.  } 31. Rde2 {Instead, the plausible-looking 31.g4 ... was met by 31...Nxf4ch!  If then 32.Rxf4(??) Bxf4 and, one way or another, Black wins a piece.  Not even the pin by 33.Rf2 will do in view of ...Rxh2ch.  White would have to play something like 32.Kh1 (instead of Rxf4), when after 32...Rc5, Black keeps the pawn.   However, Kf3 was possible.} Ng7 {The knight had to move, of course, but why here, and not ...Nc5?  No reason, that I can see now: c5 would have been a much better square for the knight.  Fortunately I haven't much damaged Black's position.  All the same, it starts to look as though White is making progress.} 32. c4 {Closing up the Q-side and transforming the weakness at c2 into a strength at c4.  But there are downsides to this.  Is a bit harder (though not impossible, as you will see) for White to induce a serious weakness in Black's Q-side, which right now is very strong.  That tends to localise White's attack to the centre and K-side, where Black is well enough placed to meet it.} Rf5 {Discouraging g4.} 33. Kf3 h5 {Black tries to hamper the g4 advance.  Normally I prefer to keep the pawns back when I am defending with pawn(s) minus, to make them harder to attack.  That policy should probably have held good here, as well.  But I was looking to stymie White's majority once and for all if I could.} 34. h3 {Good move, Black can no longer hold up White's K-side.} Kf7 {Making room for the rook to retreat.  The c5-square does not look at all like a salubrious accommodation for the rook, so I make another square available..} 35. g4 Rf6 {That the immediate exchange by Black would have left White with two joined passed pawns unopposed by enemy pawns is less an issue than another file opening up that would probably be of more use to White.  This retreat is intended instead to induce the g-pawn to advance.} 36. g5 {There was no real likelihood of White taking on h5, which would have suited Black on account of the split pawns.} Rg6 37. h4 {? - During the game I felt sure this was a mistake, and the Gameknot Analysis Engine agrees.  The pawn become a weakness that Black's handier pieces, the knight in particular, can just about reach.  A new phase begins, with Black making a serious bid for the initiative.} Nf5 {Immediately driving one rook into a passive position, as the h-pawn has to be defended.  During the sequel, the knight will conduct hit and run raids hither and thither, using this square as his base of operations.  } 38. Rh2 Rg8 {Pulling the rook back into reserve.  Black will be shifting his attention to the centre, and, given the weak point at b3, the Q-side as well.  The threats won't amount to much, but, by inducing a reaction, enable Black to make some sort of progress.  Such at least was the hope.} 39. Rh3 {I am supposing White wanted to get the rook off the bishop's diagonal, and h1 placed the rooks a knight-fork apart (a possible ...Ng3 attacking both).    But the rook is also placed so as to defend the b3-pawn should it come under attack by the knight at c5 or d4.  For the moment, meanwhile, White's passed pawns are going nowhere.} Rd8 {I do not want to exchange rooks just yet - not unless there is a 'sweetener' in the deal.  What the sweetener might be - who knows?  Time, position, material - one keeps an open mind.  After 39...Re8?, 40.Rxe8 Kxe8  41.Ke4 Ne7  42.f5! with a plus for White.  } 40. Ke2 Bc5 41. Re5 {Quite a fight for the initiative is going on.  Had White played 41.Rd3, then 41...Bd6 42.Rh3 Kg7! looks OK for Black.} Kg6 42. Re6+ Kg7 43. Re5 {Or else 43,Rf6 Nd4ch  44.Kf2 Be7  45.Rh6 Nf5  46.Rc6 Bc4ch 47.Kf1 (or Ke1; Bb4ch) Bd6.  To break the rook out of c6 would have required White to sac a pawn: c4-c5. } Nd4+ 44. Kf1 Nc6 45. Re4 {Probably better than 45.Re6 Ne7.  But maybe 45.Rd5!? would have been worth a look: 45...Rxd5 (worth it to break off a pawn from the Q-side 'island') 46.cxd5 Ne7 47.Ke2, and Black would have to think twice about 47...Nxd5 48.Rf3 and suddenly White's two passers are mobile again.} Rd2 {With a vague threat of ...Rb2 and ...Nd4 to attack the b-pawn.  } 46. Re2 {Sensible,  Defends against the threat and also frees the king from the back rank.  } Rd1+ {Still wants to keep his rook on.  Black values his flexibility to continue probes and threats that force White to respond.} 47. Re1 Rd4 {Don't sell easily parried short ranged threats below their value, just because they are short ranged and easily parried.  They are often a means to an end.  The threat now is ...Rxf4ch.  Black definitely has the initiative for the moment, but can he keep it?} 48. Rf3 Kf7 {By covering squares on the e-file, this frees the minor pieces to move.} 49. Ke2 Bb4 {!? - A wrong turning.  This leads nowhere.} 50. Rd1 Bc5 {Fortunately, I was able to rewind, here.  White dare not exchange rooks right now owing to the knight fork (Rxd4?? Nxd4ch)} 51. Re1 Rd6 {Threatens ...Nd4ch.  For the moment, progress for both sides has stalled.  It was beginning to look as though I would have to try my chances after all with the exchange of rooks.} 52. Rd3 Nd4+ {Heading back to f5 whilst the 'heading back' is good. } 53. Kd1 Nf5 {Forces the rook exchange, and just at the right moment, too. If now 54.Rxd6 Bxd6 attacks f- and h-pawns both: 54.Rh1 Bxf5 and White can not play 55.Rf1 on account of 55...Ne3ch.} 54. Kc2 {! Now if Black exchanges, the White king is handily placed near the centre.} Nxh4 {But there was nothing to stop this.  After the win of the pawn Black at last has a passed pawn of his own to play with.  Possibly White might, somewhere during the sequel, have considered a plan to give up his two pawns on the K-side for Black's h-pawn.  Then with the pawns equal on the Q-side defied Black to make good his material advantage.  I spent a lot of time studying such endings that might have arisen, with the conclusion that, with care, White might well have held.} 55. Re2 {Instead, 55.Re5  Rxd3  56.Kxd3 Bd6 57.Re4 Nf5.} Nf5 56. Rxd6 Bxd6 57. Kd3 {Rightly centralising the King.  The f-pawn is safe...} Ng3 {! - In my view the alternative, 57...Ng7 is less pressurising, though it has its points: 58.Ke4 Ne6  59.g6ch Kf6!  60.Rg2 h4  61.Rg4! h3!  62.g7 Nxg7  63.Rh4 Ne6  64.Rxh3 Nxg4.  Could Black have won from here, with B and N vs R and pawns level and symmetrical?  I thought the chances problematical, and elected to try something a bit more forcing.} 58. Rg2 h4 {Now comes some intricate manoeuvring as Black forces his way into White's territory.} 59. Rh2 Nf5 {Black demands a high price for that h-pawn.  I had set its value, by now,  at higher than the two White passers.  Could that value be realised?  Let's see!} 60. Ke4 Kg6 61. Rh3 {We've been here before, but things were different, then...} Ng3+ {A tempo gainer.  The King will take over the protection of the h-pawn, whilst the minor pieces continue their operations elsewhere.} 62. Kf3 Kh5 {Now the Black h-pawn is at least as big a menace as White's two passed pawns,  and White has been driven into a relatively passive position.  But White is by no means yet bereft of resources,} 63. Rh2 Nf5 {Threatens ...Nd4ch.} 64. Ke4 {Preventing the knight fork ...Nd4ch.  But now the Black King is permitted to invade via g4.  But after, say, 64.Rb2 or Rh3, then ...Ne7 aiming for ...Ng6, leads to a strong attack for Black anyway.  Probably best was 64.Rh1, which seems to lead to Black having to let go the h-pawn to round up the White g- and f-pawns: 64.Rh1 and [A] 64...Nd4ch 65.Ke4 Nxb3 (...Ne2 might offer more) 66.Rd1 Nc5ch? (...Kg6 is better) 67.Kf5 h3  68.Rg1! Nxa4 (really greedy, eh?) 69.Rg3 Kh4 70.Rg4ch Kh5 71.Rg3 Kh4 etc and a draw by repetition.  [B] 64...Be7(!) 65.Rd1 h3 66.Rd7 h2  67.Kg2 Bd6 68.Kxh2 Bxf4ch when Black has an edge, but, as earlier discussed, maybe not enough.} Kg4 65. g6 {White has threats of his own!  If White allows the pawn to advance on more square, then ...Nxg7; Rg2ch wins for White.  This probably represents as good a chance as any for White, but now the game begins to slip away from him.  About now I was starting to fancy my chances of a win.} Bf8 {Forced, to allow ...Ng3 in response to Rg2ch (were White to play that).} 66. Ke5 {66.Kd5 is the same but 66...Bg7 in reply is no check.} Bg7+ 67. Ke6 Bd4 {Dual purpose.  The bishop and knight together effectively blockade the g-pawn - or at least have it under close surveillance.  At the same time, the bishop covers the f2-square, allowing the king to threaten the f-pawn.} 68. Rh1 {To regain access to the f-file, and so the f-pawn is once again protected (68...Kxf4?? 69.Rf1ch wins a piece).} c6 {! - Played to prevent Kd5.  I did consider 68...c5, here, but was a bit concerned about the exposure of the b6-pawn to attack. This move leaves the c6-pawn weak, but it seemed to me that it were better to give that one up for the two White K-side pawns than to relinquish the h-pawn.  I was by now valuing the h-pawn as worth a rook.  It was not long before White reached the same conclusion.} 69. Kd7 {Maybe 70.c5!? was worth a look?  70.c5 Bxc5 71.Rxh4!? ... and now [A] 71...Nxh4?? loses to 72.g7!, but [B] 71...Kxh4  72.Kxf5 Bd4 and Black should win this end game.  } h3 70. Ke6 {A little bit of a surprise, this, as I was expecting 70.Kxc6 Ne7ch 71.Kd6 Nxg6 72.f5  Nf4 or something similar.} Ng7+ 71. Kd6 Kg3 {!? - The alternative was a case of 'as you were': 71...Nf5ch 72,Ke5, and then try 72...Ng3.  I could have played ...Ng3 at move 70, but felt that the king was the better piece to guide the h-pawn home.} 72. Kxc6 Kg2 73. Rd1 {There was nothing better.} h2 74. Kd5 {Naturally, 74.Rxd4 is hopeless.  But the rook will have to be given up for the pawn.  Black has now a winning game - for a given value of 'winning'.  White isn't going to give this one away.} Bg1 {Now White's next two moves are forced.} 75. Rd2+ Kf3 76. Rxh2 Bxh2 77. c5 {! - Grand master Paul Keres once remarked that few positions are so hopeless as to offer no hope whatever of offering resistance.  White realises that he can wipe out Black's last remaining pawns, leaving himself with the bare King-bishop-knight end game.  Now, if he can force Black to give up a piece for a fast running passed pawn, the game would be drawn.  Which will be the runner?  White's a-pawn!} bxc5 78. Kxc5 Bxf4 79. b4 {! - This is how to force an exchange or the win of material.  Immobilise the target, then attack it.  Well, Black's pawn was immobilised way back at move 6, but the principle is the same.  Black will have no pawns left.} Be3+ {! - A useful intermezzo.  Even if unessential, one should not pass up a tempo if it will help the cause.  This check means that even after the removal of the Black pawn, there will still be an obstacle to a straight run by White's a-pawn.  Black will have gained an extra move to round up the g-pawn.  (Ironically, later on Black 'has' to play a waiting move - a tempo-losing move - but 'time' is one of the three elements of chess: material, space and time).} 80. Kc4 axb4 81. Kxb4 Ke4 {Any K-move to the 4th rank would have done.} 82. Kb5 Kf5 83. Kc6 {Aiming for b7, combined with the advance of the a-pawn.  Had Black time to snaffle the g-pawn and then to reel in the a-pawn?  Let's see, shall we?} Kxg6 84. a5 {Just two moves and White will have his drawing position of K on b7 and P on a6.  Black has, before the pawn can move to a7, to get his knight SAFELY onto one of the squares b5, c6 or c8.  How will he achieve that?  } Nf5 {During the game, I thought 84...Ne6 would have been a mistake, but in fact it is just as effective as the text.  The aim here is ...Nd6, whence he can choose from the 2 squares b5 and c8 according to which is available.} 85. a6 {Edges closer, whilst the knight is being held off by the King.  No use would have been 85...Kb7 as 86.Nd6ch immediately brought the pawn to book.} Kf6 {! - } 86. Kb7 {? - Better was Kd7 or Kd5.  White has to be careful himself, here, as he doesn't want his king to be cornered with no escape.  Once it becomes clear that Black can stop and win the pawn without the loss of a piece, White could at once take his chances in the infamous king-bishop-knight vs king end game.  Though it is a winning endgame, it is not so easy.  I have had such endings before - three times, and won all three.  But they were all pick-up games, and from positions a deal more favourable to me than would probably have obtained in this game.  At this point I was certain we were in for my second ever 100-mover, stretching maybe into 120 moves or more.  For the first 100-mover check out: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/great-snakes-batman-a-100-mover?gm=18341 } Nd6+ {After this, Black can not cover both b5 and c8.} 87. Kb8 Nb5 88. Kb7 {? - Now was White's last chance to prolong the game...} Na7 {Blockade complete.  But it is worse than that.  Suddenly White's King can no longer escape into mid-board.  It turns out that White had to play 88.a7 to keep some chance, however slender, of saving the game.  Would I have won the K-B-N vs K end game?  I'm about 75% sure I would have, but that leaves plenty of room for doubt.} 89. Kc7 Ke7 {How to round up the enemy King.  Box him in and and tighten the screws.  But be sure to leave him with at least ONE square to move to, until you are ready to deliver the KO.} 90. Kb7 Kd7 91. Ka8 {There is always the hope I might get careless and play ...Kc7?? Stalemate.} Kc6 {At this point, White had realised the writing was on the wall and resigned.  The game wasn't going to reach 100 moves, neither - I think he might have played it out otherwise.  It is a forced mate in 6 more moves, which I'll set down as though they were played.} 92. Kb8 Bd4 {A waiting move.  Equally effective would have been ...Bf2 and ...Bg1, or even ...Bc5.  Not ...Bb6, though.  There, it would get in the way.} 93. Ka8 Nc8 94. Kb8 {Not 94.a7 Nb6ch 95.Kb8 Be5#} Nb6 95. Ka7 {And not 95.a7 this time, neither, as at once would then come 95.Be5#.} Nd7+ 96. Ka8 Kc7 {Leaving Black with but one move...} 97. a7 Nb6# {One of those game that I was lucky to win, with nothing much in it - maybe a slight edge for White - for 35 moves, and even when the balance tipped Black's way, it was not easy to see a way to win, even when Black gained a passed pawn of his own.  It wasn't until it became clear that White would have to give up a rook to prevent the Black h-pawn's promotion that Black's winning prospects looked realistic.}
