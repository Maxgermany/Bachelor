[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D00)"]

1. d4 {The opening begins with 1.d4 d5.  It is also possible to reach it by 1.c3 d5 2.d4.} d5 {Black continues like white, taking control of part of the center.} 2. c3 {This move may seem a bit unusual, as it blocks the c3 square and does not develop any pieces.  However, it creates a solid center for white and takes black out of the opening book.} Bf5 {This move is a normal move in position, because black wants to develop his white squared bishop before playing e6.  The problem is that black is not quite sure where the bishop is best placed, and it may spend extra tempi moving to a better square.} 3. g4 {I believe I am the developer of this move.  The idea is to force the bishop to move again while losing time. } Bxg4 {There is no reason black should decline the gambit, because if he is going to lose tempi, he might as well have a pawn for them.} 4. Bh3 {This move is much better than f3 or h3 because it develops a piece while forcing black to do something about his g4 bishop.} Qd7 {This probably is not the best move in the position as white can exchange bishops and play Qb3 targeting the weak b7 pawn.  Alternative lines include: 4...Bxh3 5.Nxh3 Nf6 6.Qb3 Qc8 7.Bf4! (if 7...Qxh3?? 8.Qxb7 Qg2 9.Rf1+-) with an interesting game and 4...Nf6 5.Qb3, which may transpose to the Bxh3 line.    } 5. Bxg4 {Taking the bishop and forcing recapture by the queen.} Qxg4 {Forced, but black's queenside looks weak.} 6. Qb3 {Attacking the b7 pawn.  The most exciting line is 6...Qg2 7.Qxb7 Qxh1 8.Kf1! Nf6 (to defend the b8 knight) 9.Qxa8 Nd7 10.Bf4 and white looks like he will win the b8 knight for a few pawns.} b6 {Black wimps out of the exciting line and gives the pawn back for free.} 7. Qxd5 {Snatching the pawn back, attacking the a8 rook, and protecting the g2 square.} c6 {Defending the a8 rook and forcing the queen to move.} 8. Qf3 {This is forced, as f3 allows Qg2.} Qg6 {Black wisely avoids trading queens and prevents white's knight from developing.} 9. e4 {Blocking the g6-b1 diagonal and getting ready to move the pieces out.} Nf6 {Developing and threatening white's e4 pawn.} 10. e5 {Pushing the pawn with a gain of time.  White's "bad bishop" is actually okay and black's bishop hasn't moved at all.} Nd5 {Probably the best place for the knight.  Now, black should play e6 and try to develop the bishop.} 11. Nd2 {The knight is developing and will move to either b3, c4, or e4. } e6 {Black is trying to develop the bishop, although his game is cramped and the b8 knight is terrible.} 12. Nb3 {I'm not sure there is much difference between the three squares for the knight, although c4 and e4 look slightly better.} Be7 {Developing the bishop.} 13. h4 {I was looking at black's misplaced queen and also wanted to trade off my weak h pawn.} h5 {Blocking both ideas.} 14. Nh3 {Now, the g1 knight comes into the game.  Bxh4 is not a problem for white as the game shows.} Bxh4 {Snatching a pawn.} 15. Rg1 {But white wins it right back and has eliminated the weak h pawn.} Qf5 {? This is a weak move that doubles black's pawns.  Better would be Qc2, but black is still in trouble.} 16. Qxf5 {Exchanging queens and doubling black's pawns.} exf5 {Forced.  Black's pawns will be a nightmare in the endgame. } 17. Rxg7 {Winning the pawn back and placing the rook at a powerful post.} Nd7 {Developing looks good, but Kf8 was practically forced because it drives back the rook.  Black will now get crushed as he has no good moves.} 18. Bg5 {? This was my probably my worst move of the game.  White's rook is liable to get trapped as it does not have many moves. } Bxg5 {? My opponent helped me a lot with this move.  18...Kf8! would have forced me to play 19.Bf6 Bxf6 20.exf6 N7xf6 winning a pawn.} 19. Nxg5 {Now it is clear that black is in deep trouble.} f6 {This is an ugly move, but Rf8 would not have been any better.} 20. Nf7 {Attacking black's rook and forcing the reply.} Rf8 {Forced and now black is almost out of breathing room.} 21. Nd6+ {Repositioning the knight and forcing Kd8.} Kd8 {Forced.} 22. e6 {White had to do something about the pawn and it is used to push black even farther back.} Nb8 {Forced.} 23. Nxf5 {Winning a pawn, but the idea is to simplify into a winning endgame.  Black's pawns are too weak to draw the endgame.} Re8 {Winning the pawn back, but at the cost of simplifying the position.} 24. c4 {Pushing the knight out of the way.  } Rxe6+ {This is best, as it wins the pawn back before deciding where to move the knight.} 25. Kd2 {Now my a1 rook can come out.} Ne7 {This move allows white to greatly simplify the position, but black needs some room for his pieces to move. } 26. Rxe7 {Simplifying and forcing Rxe7.} Rxe7 {Forced.} 27. Nxe7 {Now a lot of material has come off, and white will win the h pawn.} Kxe7 {Now black can finally develop his remaining pieces, but a draw will be difficult to obtain.} 28. Rh1 {Winning the h pawn.} Nd7 {Now black's rook can come out, but the d7 knight is not very good.} 29. Rxh5 {Now white is up a pawn and is playing to win.} Rf8 {Grabbing the g file probably would have been better, but black wants to protect against Rh7+.} 30. Ke3 {Centralizing the king.} f5 {This is not a good move, as the f pawn has no where to go and the queenside pawns are now open to attack across the 6th and 7th ranks.} 31. f4 {Stopping the f pawn from advancing any further.} Nf6 {Moving the knight to the strong e4 square.  Rxf5 is a blunder because of Ng4+ winning the rook.} 32. Rh1 {Retreating the rook. } Ng4+ {Better was Ne4.  Now, the knight is trapped near the edge of the board. } 33. Kf3 {The king shifts over and opens the e file.  Black's queenside pawns need protection.} Kd6 {Centralizing the king, but the queenside pawns are weak.} 34. Rh7 {Attacking the weak pawns.} a5 {Ra8 would make the rook absolutely terrible, and white could play Nb3-d2-f1-g3-xf5.} 35. Rb7 {Going after the pawns.} a4 {Attacking my knight, but now the a pawn is weak because it has moved too far.} 36. Nd2 {Moving the knight to a better square.} Re8 {Rxb6? would be met by Re3+ Kg2 Re2+ winning the knight.} 37. Nf1 {Dropping the knight back and making Rxb6 a threat again.} Re4 {Re1 was probably better.  Then, white would play Ng3 Re3+ Kg2 and the white king will move to h3, h4, and g5, picking up the f5 pawn.} 38. Ng3 {Now white sets a trap for black.} Rxd4 {?? The game is easily won for white because of this blunder.} 39. Nxf5+ {Black's king and rook are forked.} Kc5 {Black tries to move the king into an attacking position.} 40. Nxd4 {Winning a rook for free.} Kxd4 {Black should probably keep the knights on, but the game is lost anyway.} 41. Kxg4 {Taking the knight.} Kxc4 {Even if black's pawns become dangerous, white can sacrifice the rook for them and promote the f pawn.} 42. Rxb6 {Winning one more pawn and the game is over.  Black resigned here.}
