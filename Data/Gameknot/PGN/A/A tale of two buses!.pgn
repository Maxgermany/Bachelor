1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Me again!  After obtaining a high draw I end up chalking up a welcome victory against a 1300+ player.  You are wondering what do the two buses have to do with a game of chess.  Answer - everything.  After 6 months of failing to deliver checkmate I end up delivering two within a few days of one another, one on the Dentist which was annotated as "Learning from the Master Mater" and now this one!  Usually I end up delivering mate with Glenda or a castle, but this time it is a mere steed!  This is in fact part of Master Freddy's tournament, the Annotation's project and I now have 3 points out of 6 games in it.  Anyhow, on with the game and we pick up the action on move 8.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 {8. ........ Kc7 - black has a choice of king moves and he chooses to move his king to c7 rather than c6.  I wonder how far he is going to play into Master Freddy's self-annotation?  We shall see.} 9. Bxg4 Qe8 10. Ne6+ {10. Ne6+ - still following on from Master Freddy's self-annotation and also my game against Master Freddy that I lost.} Kb6 11. Nc3 {11. Nc3 - I now deviate from my game against Master Freddy.  I played Na3 there and it was suggested that Nc3 was an improvement.  Ah well, let's try it!} Kc6 12. d4 {12. d4 - opening a line for Fou Lenoir.} h5 13. Bf5 {13. Bf5 - I decide that this looks strong because I may well be able to round up the e4 pawn with check and really harass my opponent's king.} Na6 {13. ...... Na6 - development and intends to go to b4.} 14. Be3 {14. Be3 - I do not mess about - I clear the decks and place Fou Lenoir on a decent line in the vicinity of the black king.} Nb4 15. O-O-O {15. 0-0-0 - I answer the threat of the knight fork on c2 with developing my queen rook.  Castling queenside removes Henry from the fork at the same time.  The rook rakes down the d column and the BK is on the c column.  If black decided to trade pawns on d4 then Nxd4+ could be very nasty.} g6 16. Bxe4+ {16. Bxe4+ - nice to close the material deficit to just two points.  Look how the ecclesiastical brothers Fou Leblanc and Fou Lenoir are lined up on the BK.} Kd6 17. Nxc5 {17. Nxc5 - just one material point adrift now.} Rb8 18. a3 {18. a3 - my gut instinct tells me to play this move.  I also have a premonition that black will play Nc6.  If so I spot an excellent move.  You will see what it is very very soon!} Nc6 {18. ........ Nc6?? - wait for it, wait for it .......} 19. Nb5# {19. Nb5 - MATE!!! - A snap mate out of the top drawer.  Master Freddy just lurves delivering mate with his knights, just let him see this!!!}
