[White "Eric (white)"]
[Black "Anu (black)"]
[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {The Reti Opening: my favorite hypermodern approach as white.} Nc6 {I expected Nf6 or d5, but this move is new. Wouldn’t recommend it.} 2. g3 {I continue developing slowing and fianchettoing.} d5 {Now controlling the centre. I think maybe d6 would also be good because the knight can then move to e4.} 3. Bg2 {I complete my fianchetto.} e5 {Now Anu has complete control of the centre, but I have a nice developed kingside.} 4. d3 {Finally developing the queenside now.} h6 5. Nbd2 Bc5 {Standard developing} 6. h3 Bd7 {Bf5 would have been better, but Anu wanted the queen behind the bishop for the threat of Bxh3 later on. However, I still recommend Bf5.} 7. O-O Qc8 {Bxh3 could happen now.} 8. Kh2 {Note that if white went another move, and allowed Bxh3, the follow-up could be like 8. ... Bxh3 9. g4 Bxg7 10. Kxg7, leaving black a pawn up. On the other hand, if white went g4 immediately, the kingside would be slightly more exposed with the dangerous h2-b8 diagonal open to attack.} Nf6 9. Nb3 {And so the harassment of the black DSB has begun.} Bb6 10. a4 a5 11. c4 d4 12. c5 Ba7 {Notice how horribly placed black’s DSB is.} 13. Qc2 Be6 {! This threatens 14. ... Bxb3 15. Qxb3 Bxc5 and the DSB is back in the game.} 14. Bd2 {Ra3 would have been more safe. I was threatening h5 but didn’t realize that AFTER the combo I mentioned earlier, the rook would be guarding that pawn as well as the knight.} Nh7 {And Anu misses the attack.} 15. Nxa5 {But my plan (accidentally) works.} Nxa5 16. Bxa5 Ng5 {More pressure on h3. My heart is pounding at this point.} 17. Ng1 {The only safe move I could think of.} h5 18. h4 {Relieving the pressure.} Nh7 {Black still hasn’t castled.} 19. c6 {Now the DSB is free, but there is a threat along the long h1-a8 diagonal.} b6 {...and the DSB is trapped again.} 20. Bb4 g5 21. Nf3 f6 22. Qd2 Rg8 23. Ba3 Bd5 24. Qb4 {With the immediate threat of Qe7#. Black should have castled way earlier to avoid this.} Rg7 {Now the key is the Nh7.} 25. Nxg5 {!! A beautiful discovered attack!} fxg5 {The only move.} 26. Bxd5 gxh4 27. Bg8 {Ha-ha! Now black is in a real pickle. If the rook moves off the 7th rank, you’re doomed; if your knight is taken off the board, Qf8 kills you.} hxg3+ {The last chance...} 28. fxg3 {!! Now the f1 rook has the whole f-file to itself!} Qg4 {A tempo too late.} 29. Rf8+ {!!!} Nxf8 30. Qxf8# {Whew! That was an amazing, exciting game between Anu and I. My heart was POUNDING LIKE CRAZY! Hope you enjoyed!}
