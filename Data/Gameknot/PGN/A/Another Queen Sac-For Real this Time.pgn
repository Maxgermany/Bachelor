[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {So, Joe decides to kick things off with the well known King's Pawn Opening.} c5 {And, Ben responds by starting with the Sicilian Defense.  As we will see later on, however, this defense is not going to continue.} 2. Qh5 {On the one hand, as everyone has said repeatedly in previous annotations, it's important to stick with the principles.  In that, I would have played 2.Nf3, if I were white as it often leads to an Open Sicilian, especially after 2...d6, 3.d4.  On the other hand, as easy19 told me, when you're rating is super high, like 2000+, you can deviate from the basics and still play just as well.  That is happening here.} a6 {I understand that black wanted to prevent white from playing 3.Bc5.  However, if I were black, I would have played 2...Nf6 to kick the Q while continuing to develop normally because it normally loses important tempii for the opponent.  On the other hand, that would not have made a difference, this time, because of what white plays next.} 3. Qxf7+ {!! Normally, I would mark this with two question marks because giving up your Q like this, is often the losing blunder.  This time, however, I view it as extraordinarily brilliant.  As we will see later on, this is a winning move.} Kxf7 4. Nf3 {After the sac, however, Joe decides to develop.} h6 {I don't understand why black moved here.  Better was to either develop or bring the K back to safety, given that he can't castle.  If you had to ask me, however, my vote would be to retreat the King, where it is no longer exposed.} 5. Ne5+ {So, after Ben's last move, white decides to place black in check.  Now, Joe's opponent has no choice but to move the K.} Ke8 {! Good choice.  Ben also could have played 5...Ke6!?, but that would have excaberated the exposure.  This, however, takes it away.} 6. Be2 {I don't completely understand this move.  I mean, that mate will be threatned soon, which is why white played this.  But, in this position, Joe also could have threatened mate with 6.Bc4.  And, Ben would be forced to give up his d pawn, in order to avoid that. } d6 {?? On the other hand, I understand this move.  Black played it in order to kick Joe's N.  The problem is that it gives white the opportunity that he's been waiting for, the threat of mate after 7.Bh5+, so this move loses immediately.  I mean, I would have thought about this move but would have played 6...Nf6 to prevent what is about to unfold.} 7. Bh5+ g6 {Forced.} 8. Bxg6# {After this game, I learned a very important fact about Queen sac's.  It might take a while, but very skilled players can sometimes pull a win, by sacrificing their Queen.  With that in mind, I would like to thank Joe for teaching me this concept. }
