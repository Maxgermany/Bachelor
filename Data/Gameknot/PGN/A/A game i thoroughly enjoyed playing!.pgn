1. e4 {My opponent played the rather common e4- but } Nc6 {a more interesting game} 2. d4 {at this point i felt in a much weaker position, white had much more control of the center} e5 {but i decided to attack } 3. d5 {white played as most people would} Nce7 {this forced my knight back, making my opening slightly weaker} 4. c4 {white simply keeps pushing those pawns} Ng6 {ah! I spotted Ng6 as a way to start a better attack as well as free my pieces more} 5. Nc3 {quite boring and expected move in my opinion} Bc5 {AS is usually played: Bc5} 6. Be3 {counter attacked by white} Bxe3 {the swap off is accepted} 7. fxe3 {however i pulled out better from that position because white's pawn island is slightly weaker (double pawn)} d6 {opening up still} 8. Nf3 {rather expected} Nh4 {I was trying to get a bit fancier} 9. Qd2 {white didn't accept the bait} Nxf3+ {i still saw my oppurtunity} 10. gxf3 {what else could one expect from white then!} Qh4+ {playing my queen out} 11. Kd1 {now white cannot castle} Bd7 {still getting pieces out!} 12. Rg1 {so is white} g6 {had to prevent that!} 13. Kc2 {i wasn't sure why white played that except from maybe wanting to get its rook out and doing an artificial castling} O-O-O {i'm now bringing my rook into action} 14. b4 {pushing pawns on the side i castled- usually a good idea} Nf6 {here comes my knight} 15. c5 {the fight has only just begun} Ne8 {it may seem odd but i felt that my knight was absolutely useless in its previous spot} 16. a4 {still pushing pawns} dxc5 {ah, now i take the bait} 17. bxc5 {he takes} Qe7 {i make my queen more useful} 18. Bb5 {he is deterrmine to play on the offence} Qxc5 {but that was a slight blunder} 19. Rgc1 {white now attempts to get a sneaky attempt of attack on my queen} Nd6 {i may only be a pawn up but it will make all the difference neccessary} 20. Kd1 {still going for its plan} Qb4 {i say no no to that } 21. Rab1 {desperate to get my queen!!!} Qa5 {i'm not having it though} 22. Qb2 {what's white up to now- still developing pieces?} Bxb5 {I play more offensive now!} 23. Nxb5 {white has fallen for the trap} Qxa4+ {i'm by more than one pawn now!} 24. Ke2 Qxb5+ {Queen swap would be good!} 25. Qxb5 {he accepts} Nxb5 {I don't have an any better move} 26. Rxb5 {white's most probable best move- unless both me and my opponent are missing something:)} Rd7 {playing defensive} 27. Rcb1 {not his cup of tea though} b6 {but i'm not taking any of that!} 28. Rc1 {He seemed to have made a rather random move to me!} Rhd8 {but i want to attack now} 29. Rc6 {is he trying to prevent c6??} Rd7d6 {i make the offer} 30. Rc4 {he  declined} f5 {now my chance to push pawns} 31. exf5 {he takes} gxf5 {i'm not to be left behind} 32. Rh4 {playing agressive if it is possible in chess} a6 {if he is attacking so am i!} 33. Rb2 {I would say that is a fatal error on white's part} Rd6xd5 {it leads on to something elese later on in the game} 34. Rxh7 {swap off in a way} Rd5d7 {another one?} 35. Rh5 {Nah!} Rg8 {Oooh-will white notice the threat of losing the other rook!...} 36. Kf2 {Yes} Rdg7 {but i've not finished} 37. Rb4 {he flees} Rg7g1 {now i'm going for the mate} 38. Ke2 {but problem solved for white} Rg8g2+ {or did he also create a new problem??} 39. Kd3 {his only option} Rd1+ {not a great one though} 40. Kc3 {king in the open- a bit too far from the proper end game} Re1 {still- i felt like picking off those pawns} 41. Kd3 {but white doesn't agree} Rge2 {however, i force white to agree!} 42. e4 {or not!} a5 {still playing more offensive now!} 43. Rb5 {escapes again} fxe4+ {aha} 44. fxe4 Re2xe4 {black is another point up!} 45. Rh8+ {what is white up to ??} Kb7 {maybe something i didn't notice} 46. Rd5 {where is that rook going- i had considered Rd1+ but luckily i noticed the mistake in time!} a4 {instead i decided to go for the queen!} 47. Rdd8 {white was relentless!} a3 {but i'm not giving up on my queen} 48. Rdb8+ {i don't see the point in that} Kc6 {i can just escape} 49. Rh6+ {what is white really trying to do???} Kb5 50. Rc8 {now white is after my pawn} Ra4 {extra protection for my pawn} 51. Rxc7 {yes- white fell for the trick} a2 {here it goes} 52. Rcc6 Rd4+ {now you see it!} 53. Kc2 Ka4 {this is white's downfall!} 54. Rcxb6 {what is white up to now} Re2+ {something that won't help now (forced mate)} 55. Kc1 a1=Q+ {you get me!} 56. Rb1 {only option ....and} Qc3# {there we are!!!}
