1. d4 Nf6 {indian game} 2. c4 g6 {the KID(kings indian defense). I am great against the regular KID but I hate the grunfield, so I did not play Nc3 but played...} 3. f3 {the alekhines anti-grunfield variation. } d5 {the neo-grunfield.} 4. cxd5 {this is best} Nxd5 {recapturing} 5. e4 {chasing his N. I dominates the center, this isn't what grunfield players likes!} Nf6 {Nb6 is better, the bishop is closed after Nf6} 6. e5 {this is not the best, the absence of the c pawn means the knight cannot be chased and this bishop can dominate the diagnal.} Nd5 7. Bc4 {getting his Q vulnerable} Bg7 8. Bxd5 Qxd5 {his Q is in the center} 9. Nc3 {developing with tempos} Qd8 {she get back to d8} 10. f4 {I am an attacker} O-O {castling.} 11.
