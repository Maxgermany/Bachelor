[Opening "Caro-Kann (B18), classical, Flohr variation"]

1. e4 c6 {When I challenged Dmaestro we have already agreed to play the caro kann} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {The main line which in my opinion gives white the best chance to fight for an advantage. The two main alternatives e5 and exd5 are also playable. } dxe4 4. Nxe4 {From here black has 2 main options 4. ...Bf4(classical main line) 4. ...Nbd7(Symlov/karpov). I should also mention that black can also try the much less common 4. ...Nf6 challenging white's knight immediately. } Bf5 {The most solid line and dare I say where all roads lead to a draw. } 5. Ng3 {White retreats his knight to g3 preferring to play it safe(the main idea behind Ng3 is to take control of the strong outpost of f4) rather than play the sharp 5. Nc5 which is very good for black after 5. ...b6 6. Nb3 e5 gives black a good initiative. Also not good is 5. Nf3?? where the knight has wasted valuable time and  blocks c2-c4.  } Bg6 6. Nf3 {developing. Not 6. Bd3 Bxd3 7. Qd3 and black has managed to exchange his LSB without any real concessions. I.E the pawn weakness on the king side the occurs after white plays h4} Nf6 {Black responds by developing his knight and countering whites control in the centre. } 7. h4 {Threatening to win the LSB so black is forced to create a weakness on his king side via ...h6} h6 {Once the LSBs have been exchanged black will have a enduring weakness on the light squares on the king side. But history has shown that this weakness is minor. } 8. h5 {gaining space on the king side and allowing to the possibility of the h1 rook to enter the game via h4.  However, the drawback is that the h pawn is very weak here and black can usually win it} Bh7 9. Bd3 {Now it makes sense for white to force the exchange black has conceded a slight weakness. } Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 {some black players prefer 10. ...Qc7 in order to prevent white from playing Bf4 which denies white a great developing square for his DSB. It is also a thematic caro-kann move that sets up a counter attack on ...c5 via the move order ...Nbd7} 11. Bf4 {taking advantage of black's last move and preventing ...Qc7. Of course black would love to put his queen on c7. But in order to do so he has to either force the exchange on d6 or play ...Qa5 deflecting the bishop off of the diagonal. } Bd6 {most common although if I were Dmaestro I would play the tricky 11. ...Qa5!? and now 12. c3 allows black to develop rapidly with 12. ...Nbd7 13. Ne5 Nd5 14. Qf3 Nd5 Or if 12. Bd2 Qa6 13. Qxa6 Nxa6 with a slight advantage for black. } 12. Bxd6 Qxd6 {The first main sortie is over and white has nothing worth while to show for it. The game is a dead draw} 13. O-O {I decide to castle king side because my main idea of attack is going to be c2-c4 followed by d4-d5. Which has the advantage of breaking up black's strong control of d5. } Nbd7 {This knight almost always belongs here. I am glad that Dmaestro did not play 0-0 since it has been often proven that many times in the caro kann the black king is better placed on e7 than on g7. So it is wise to forgo castling until white initiates his attack.} 14. c4 O-O {a good solid move that does not try to force something that is not there. The other chief idea is 14. ...a5 is pointless. } 15. Rad1 {Since there is no attacking chances I decide to strengthen my center and centralize my rooks. Black has the same idea. } Rad8 16. Rfe1 {with my development complete I plan to try a queen side pawn storm via a3 and b4. } Qc7 {a very good move that I think has two purposes #1 move the Queen to a more secure square on c7 and #2 prepare counter play via ...c5.} 17. a3 {Now this is where things get difficult for most black players. The right plan is to sit back and let white try to force a breakthrough. Which of course it near impossible. However, I played 17. a3 to rattle black's cage in the hopes that he would become desperate. } c5 {!! this is a great move for black. Even though it is risky to voluntary weaken d5. Having said all of that instead of just sitting back and allowing white to come at him black finds the most active defense.  The most solid and safest move is 17. ...Rfe8} 18. d5 {Now white has the chance to open things up slightly in his favor. } exd5 19. cxd5 {Well how about that! black has managed to create an isolated pawn. Here black is slightly better because of his superior pawn structure. But white is not without chances since the d5 pawn is well defended and cramping black's position. In short this is a very double edged position. } Nb6 {?? Black has ideas of immediately attacking the isolated pawn but however, he does not do it the right way. The way to handle a isolated pawn is to #1 block-aid it #2 control the square directly in front of it. #3 attack it by bring every piece you have to bare on it and in that order. In this case Black does #3 first and tries to do #2 but never has a chance to do #1. So this is how black wins the pawn 19. ...c4!(the knight on e7 is the blockaid after the pawn is obliged to move to d6) 20. Qd4 Qc5(threatening to win the d5 pawn) 21. Nf5 Rfe8 22. Rxe8 Rxe8 23. Qxc5 Nxc5 24. Nd6 Rd8 25. Nxc4 Rxd5 and black has a slightly better endgame. } 20. d6 {Black attacked d5 but he did not have control of the square directly in front of it. Now the d pawn is very powerful! } Qb8 {20...c4 is still the best defense. } 21. Nf5 {The knight that was forced back onto g3 has now returned to initiate the finally assault. The logical behind whites plan is step #1 amass piece superior around the area of the enemy king. This will come in the form of Ne5, Nf5, Qf3 and Re5. step #2 is to expose the king by a knight sacrifice on g7 or h6. And finally step #3 breakthrough where all of white's piece swarm the black king. } Nxh5 22. Ne5 {With knights on e5 and f5 white dominates the board. It also gives white the ability to play Qf3 attacking the hanging knight on h5} Nd7 {Black wants to play 23. ...Nxe5 } 23. Qf3 {I allow black to follow through with his plan because I plan to meet it with Rxe5 combing threats on h5 and h6} Nxe5 24. Rxe5 {Step #1 of the attack plan is complete. White has three pieces to black's two on the king side. } g6 {it seems logical to try and drive the knight out of f5 but this is not very good for black. When being attacked it is recommended to keep the pawns in front of your king at home. Instead try and bring more of your pieces closer to the defense of your king. For black I would recommend 24. ...Nf6 as being the best chance of defending. } 25. Nxh6+ {Step #2 expose the king} Kg7 {The black king hides behind the pawn on g6 so it most be removed} 26. Rxh5 {!! The sacrifice is made and the rook gives up his life for the greater good step #2 is now complete. } gxh5 27. Nf5+ Kf6 {Black is looking to escape through the back door. } 28. Rd5 {Step #3 is now complete all of his pieces are swarming king who is completely defenseless} Ke6 29. Nd4+ {mate in 3. } Kd7 30. Qf5+ {black resigns after a very valiant fight. Black managed to hold white to a draw out of the opening. Even in the middle game black was doing very well. However, black did try the great but risky 17. ...c5 which needed razor sharp defending on his part to pull off. In the end, black misplayed the isolated pawn and got crushed on the king side. From a teaching perspective it is instructive to walk through how white executed a well formed plan that ended with a classic attack on the king side. In my opinion players who swear by playing attack chess will do well to understand how and why White's attack succeeded. }
