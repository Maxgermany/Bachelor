1. d4 e6 2. Bf4 c5 3. e3 cxd4 4. exd4 Nc6 5. c3 d5 6. Nf3 {...and we reach a "normal" London setting. } Nf6 7. h3 Be7 8. g4 {The key move. Best for black is to develop and castle queenside. } h6 9. Ne5 O-O {Thank you. } 10. h4 Nxe5 11. dxe5 Ne4 12. Bg3 {Good for black is to exchange. But he has another good idea.} g5 {If h5, everything is blocked on the kingside. } 13. Nd2 {A risky move. } Nxg3 14. fxg3 gxh4 {I thought here about Qc2, and probably it is better. Anyway, I decided to set a little trap. } 15. Qf3 {He thinks that I intend to retake g3 with the queen, overlooking...} hxg3 16. Rxh6 Bg5 {Well calculated by black. I thought about the sac Rh8+, KxR, Qh1+, Kg7, Bd3, but after Rh8 I had nothing, so...} 17. Rh5 {Best for black is BxN+, KxN, d4, exploiting white's king unprotected position. I could survive it, but it was not easy to play. } Kg7 {Ok, intending to cover the h column with Rh8.} 18. O-O-O {Necessary? I was worried about d4. } Kg6 {Now, this is a wasted tempo. Better was Rh8. } 19. Qxg3 f6 {Nf3 was ok, I guess. But the check was too nice to miss. } 20. Bd3+ Kg7 {f5 was not playable because after gxf5, the bishop is pinned and attacked. } 21. Rh7+ Kg8 22. Qh3 {This simple move is decisive. } f5 23. Rh8+ Kf7 24. Qh5+ {Not Qh7, Ke8 (even if RxR+, KxR, Qh8+ leads to more or less the same result: the Bg4 is lost. This is why BxN+ was advidable for black, a move before. } Kg7 {A loses inmediately. But after Ke7, QxB+, the game was won all the same. } 25. Qh7# {}
