[Opening "Sicilian (B96), Najdorf, 7.f4"]

1. e4 {Before I started the game I checked my opponent's repertoire and saw that he uses the Nimzo-indian as a defence to 1. d4 and the Sicilian as a response to 1. e4. I'm still working my way around finding a good line against the Nimzo so I chose to take battle in more familiar territory. } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {As expected, my opponent went with the Najdorf. It's endorsed by just about everyone that plays the Sicilian but for some reason it's not as popular anymore in GM practice. Much more popular are the Ruy Lopez, especially the Berlin wall line, and the Petroff, which I dread myself.} 6. Bg5 {Today the English attack, either with Be3 or f3 directly, is more fashionable but I think there is a lot more venom in the old main line.} e6 7. f4 Qc7 {A rather rare sideline but it does have a few points to it. I actually play it myself on occasion. The purpose of this idea is to save a move in normal lines, namely Be7. It can lead to quite a few sharp lines but it can be positional as well. Kasparov used this line on a number of occasions. Trying to play Nbd7, preserving the pawn structure, allows White to play Bc4, so it's generally accepted that this is the more exact move.} 8. f5 {This move tries to take advantage of Qc7 and weaken the pawn chain. As an extra bonus the Bg5 can travel back the diagonal if needed. The drawback is that e5 is now in Black's hands.} Be7 {Black decides he doesn't want a compromised pawn structure and is ready to castle. There is another point behind Qc7, that being that Nc6 can be played, which in normal lines would be met with Nxc6 followed by e5.} 9. Qf3 {I'm getting ready to castle long and start an attack on the K-side. A typical Sicilian position.} Nc6 {Attacking the Nd4 and taking control of e5.} 10. O-O-O {Slightly better than exchanging the Knight.} O-O {10...Nxd4 11. Rxd4 and I will get some pressure on Black's d-pawn after Be2 and Rhd1. 10...Ne5 is met very comfortably by Qg3.} 11. Kb1 {A typical move that makes sure there won't be any tactical resources against my King. In these types of positions it's also a good waiting move. For example, in many positions it's better to capture on c6 only after the Bc8 has moved to d7 because capturing with the b-pawn will be weaker then.} Bd7 {This pattern of developing pieces, including the pawn structure and the piece placement is seen in many lines and is very elastic since many plans are available to Black. } 12. Nxc6 {Releasing the central pressure in order to focus the pieces on a K-side attack. It's very interesting the developing the Bishop to d7 makes the capture with the b-pawn less desirable.} Bxc6 {After 12...bxc6 White can quickly get an attack going, for example 13. g4 Rab8 14. Bc1 (having this square free for a Bishop retreat is another bonus of playing an early Kb1. Now b2 is secure and Black's counterplay is delayed) d5 (hitting in the centre in reply to a flank attack) 15. g5 Nxe4 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Qxe4 c5 (with the idea of Bc6) 18. f6! (and White gets a powerful initiative)} 13. Bd3 {Defending e4. With the Knights on the board this move wouldn't have been possible and the more passive Be2 would have to been played.} Nxe4 {A common trick in the Sicilian but it doesn't work so well here.} 14. Bxe4 {Taking with the Knight is weaker because of the pin.} Bxg5 {With no nasty check. If you've played the White side of the Sicilian you'll learn that moves like Kh1 and Kb1 aren't a waste of time at all.} 15. fxe6 {Getting ready to win the pawn back with a slight edge.} fxe6 {A natural move, 15...Rae8 looks interesting but after the almost forced 16. exf7+ Rxf7 17. Qd3 Bxe4 18. Nxe4 Bf4 19. g3 Qc6 20. Rhe1 Rfe7 21. Nf6+ gxf6 22. Rxe7 Rxe7 23. gxf4, White has a much better endgame position.} 16. Qh3 {The double threat on e6 and h7 recovers the pawn.} Bxe4 {Removing the dangerous White Bishop.} 17. Qxe6+ {Here I looked at a few lines and decided that this was the most promising one, keeping the Queens on the board and playing this simplified middlegame where my Knight will be very strong on d5. After 17. Nxe4 Bf4 18. Qxe6+ Qf7 19. Qxf7+ Rxf7 20. Nxd6 Bxd6 21. Rxd6 Rf2 22. g3 Re8, Black can easily hold this endgame.} Qf7 {Forced or else Nxe4 is too strong.} 18. Qxe4 {This was the position I was aiming for. Material wise, things are even, but I think I have a solid positional edge. My pawn structure is very good, I have a good blockade point on d5, Black's King can come under a form of attack if Queens are on the board, plus the d6 pawn is weak. Black's trumps are his Bishop which has a lot of open space to roam but nothing to bite at, his command of the f-file and the central spot e5 for his Bishop.} Bf6 {Aiming for Be5.} 19. Nd5 {Centralizing the Knight. If things get bad, I can always blunt out the Bishop with c3. You can't say the same about a Knight as there isn't really a way you can blunt out a Knight.} Be5 {Carrying on with the piece placement plan.} 20. Qd3 {Overprotecting the Knight and preparing to contest the f-file.} b5 {I think Black could very do without this move. At least not until I was forced to play c3 so that the threat of opening lines with b4 would be more concrete.} 21. Rhf1 Qb7 {Perhaps this was the point of b5?} 22. h4 {Here I intended of playing h4-h5 and g4 and if Black would allow it, putting a Knight on f5, which would a true dream square in this position. Of course such a plan can only work with the Queens on the board otherwise the pawn would be pretty weak in the endgame.} Rae8 23. h5 {Putting Black's K-side under pressure. It's not easy to find a defensive plan against the threat of advancing the pawns. Anything creates weak points that my Knight, combined with a Rook and Queen can quickly create a strong attack.} Rxf1 {So it's understandable that my opponent wanted to exchange material in order to tone down my initiative.} 24. Rxf1 Rf8 {This really surprised me. I saw that the pure piece endgame is better for because despite the open position and the relative advantage of the Bishop over Knight, Black's pawn structure doesn't compensate it.} 25. Rxf8+ Kxf8 26. Qf3+ {Maybe 26. Qf5 would be more clean-cut but this is enough for me.} Qf7 {Black is forced to exchange Queens because of the discovered Knight check, winning the Qb7.} 27. Qxf7+ Kxf7 28. c3 {A quiet move. Black's Bishop is blunted and my King can come into play. Trying to win a pawn outright with Nc7 would have given Black good drawing chances. For example 28. Nc7 d5 29. Nxa6 Bd6 30. c3 Kf6 31. Kc2 Kg5 32. Kd3 Kxh5 33. Kxd5 Bf4 34. Kd4 Kg4 35. Nc5 Kg4 36. c4 bxc4 37. Ne6 g5 38. a4 Bd2 39. Kxc4 Kxg2 and Black is still hanging on. Lines like this show the dangers of pressing to hard and trying to win at once in the endgame. Don't rush if you can wait is a basic rule of the endgame. There is not point in compromising your position if you don't see a clear win. Just play solid moves and wait.} a5 {There is a saying in chess and it's very true, the threat is more dangerous than the execution. I'm sure you've seen many GM games where they would delay executing a basic recapture almost to the point it wasn't possible anymore. This is done for a good reason. If you have a threat and your opponent can't do anything about it, don't rush. Taunt him. It's very infuriating and difficult to play from a psychological point of view. You're expecting your opponent to execute his threat but he doesn't. You begin to wonder why he doesn't. Maybe you calculate everything again, believing you have compensation. You can't find any. Then you look at the move he just made. It doesn't threaten anything. So you decide to remove the threat, seeing as your opponent has given you an unexpected breather. Then you make the fatal blunder and see what it was that your opponent was really threatening.} 29. b4 {Such is the case here. My opponent wanted to get rid of the Nc7 threat and decided that he can only defend the pawns by pushing them. But that turns out to be a serious mistake for a very simple reason. The pawns are now fixed and easy to be munched by the Knight. Also, by advancing his pawns he's helping me create a distant passed pawn much sooner than I would have expected.} Ke6 {Black decides to at least activate his King at the cost of that pawn.} 30. Nc7+ Kd7 31. Nxb5 Kc6 32. a4 {Notice how the Knight and pawns cover everything and there isn't anything for Black to do. He just has to wait and hope I stumble.} Kb6 33. Kc2 {Having won a pawn, it's time I activate my King.} g6 {A common defence in simplified endings where you're material down is to exchange pawns, hopefully to the point where there is only one left and you can sacrifice a piece for it, thus securing a theoretical draw.} 34. hxg6 hxg6 35. Kd3 d5 {Denying my King access to d4 and opening more diagonals for his Bishop to move on.} 36. g4 {I wanted to fix the K-side pawn so that I could combine threats against them with threats against the d-pawn and threats of advancing the Q-side pawns. Black Bishop couldn't possible cover all that.} g5 {Making life very easy for me. I think it was Philidor, much before Capablanca tha stated that in Bishop endings, it's wise to place your pawns on the opposite colour of your Bishop and on the same colour of your opponent's Bishop. Beginners usually do the exact opposite thing. They fear that the Bishop will capture their pawns and move them to the wrong colour and they want their Bishop to defend their own pawns so they give themselves a bad Bishop.} 37. Nd4 {Time to put the steed to work.} axb4 {If Black doesn't capture, I can play b5 and then the a-pawn will be an extra weakness in the already full plateau Black has at his disposal.} 38. cxb4 Bd6 39. Nc2 {Defending b4 and clearing d4 for the King.} Be5 {Black has to go back and cover d4 with the Bishop.} 40. Ne3 {Tying the Black King to the defence of the d-pawn.} Kc6 41. Nf5 {Aiming for Nd4 followed by a5. The correct plan in advancing the pawns against a Bishop is to advance them on the same colour squares as the Bishop so that he cannot blockade them adequately.} Bf6 42. Nd4+ Kb6 43. a5+ Ka6 44. Nf5 {One last diversion. Ne3 is threatened and Black can't defend the d-pawn properly.} Kb5 45. Ne3 Kc6 46. a6 {Creating a runner on the edge of the board. In case of 46...Kb6 then 47. Nxd5+ with a very simple win.} Bd8 {Going for b6 to stop the a-pawn.} 47. Nxd5 {But it's one move to slow. This Knight move makes the Black Bishop look ridiculous since there isn't anything he can do to stop the a-pawn from Queening. My opponent finally resigned here. A nice tour-de-force by the White Knight against the Black Bishop.}
