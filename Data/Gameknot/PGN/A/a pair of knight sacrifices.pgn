[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {just a quick game here, but interesting nonetheless. In this game, an early sacrifice from White leads to an immediate advantage, but Black fights back. White needs to complete the attack - but how can he do that?} e5 {A King's Pawn opening} 2. Nf3 f6 {This isn't the best move in this position, as White has a counter that immediately breaks up Black's defence...} 3. Nxe5 {not unheard of, but it is the first time I have been able to do this :)} fxe5 {recommended in the DB here is Qe7, which at least relieves Black from the pressure of White's next move...} 4. Qh5+ {! Both paths lead to imminent danger from Black!} g6 {While this move loses the rook for Black, the alternative isn't really that much better positionally; 4...Ke7 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bf4+ d5 [to stop Qf5+ after the King moves to g6] 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.d4 and White already has a formidable attack} 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 {here, Black now has the ability to counter-attack...} 6. Qxh8 Qxe4+ {...as shown. Though Black has to deal with a dangerous queen, his own queen provides the making of a counter-attack} 7. Be2 {? drops the pawn on g2, and now Black's queen may be a thorn in White's side as well...} Qxg2 {such as stopping White from castling (ironically, I played Be2 to keep kingside castling a possibility for White)} 8. Rf1 Ne7 {getting his knight out of harm's way, and protecting the g6 pawn, as it's defender will be gone very soon....} 9. Qxh7 Qe4 {?! perhaps a developing move would have been better here, such as 9...d5 (striking a claim to the centre and opening up a path for the bishop) or 9...Nc6} 10. Nc3 {I end up losing the c-pawn here as well, but that knight has its uses here (though I haven't seen it yet at this point)} Qxc2 {fortunately for White, the rest of White's pieces are well protected, so the reign of terror from the enemy Queen is now over (though she is in a strong position)} 11. Rg1 {I guess I could have driven the Queen away with Bd1, but like I've said I'm not worried about the Queen at this point - I look to exploit Black's weakened kingside} d6 {opens up room for the White bishop, but it never does come out to play. I now see a way to relieve Black's control over g6...} 12. d3 {step #1 - cut off the Black queen. If Black could see what I was planning, he'd play c6.} Nbc6 {nope, Black doesn't see it, and now White delivers the killer blow...} 13. Nd5 {! one way or another, the knight defender will have to go, and as far as I can see there is no way to save the g-pawn - alt. variation [should Black see the importance of the g-pawn] 13...Ne5 14.Nxe7 Bxe7 15.Rxg6 Nxg6 16.Qxg6+ Kd8 17.Qg8+ Bf8 18.Bg7+ Kd7 19.Bg4# ((tell me if I made a mistake on this, it's the longest analysis I've ever done))} Nxd5 {my knight has been taken, but it was taboo, due to...} 14. Qxg6+ {one move before, Black may have had a chance that I overlooked, but now Black is doomed! There is no way to stop mate} Kd7 {Ke7 and Kd8 both fall to 15.Bg5+ Kd7 16.Bg4#} 15. Bg4+ Ke7 16. Bg5+ Nf6 17. Bxf6# {and mate! a fun game :)}
