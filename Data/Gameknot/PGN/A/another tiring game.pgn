[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Scandinavian variation"]

1. e4 {This is part of my clubchampionship and as usual I am the bottom seed though I actually score better than a few of the players and I'm sure my rating will eventually cacth up to my level. I had played the first two rounds very badly because I was playing two of the top three seeds and theoretically my best chances would lie with complicated tactical attacking positions so I played them and it ended badly, this game I decided to stick with how I play best which is a more positional style of play. actually most of the games I lose are games where I try and be too attacking.} Nf6 {I chose the Alekhine defence, I have begun playing it a few times as a slightly less common opening that is not unsound and can generate good play.} 2. Nc3 {My opponent decides to decline the traditional chasing of the knight and infact refuses to push it for quite a while, even when it seems it would be good for white.} e6 {!? I like this move, I think it has been played in a few high level games before and is likely to get us out of book quite quickly. I have played this position about 5-6 times and in each case the position has turned into some sort of mutation of well known openings like the french, sicilian and even a bennoni!} 3. Nf3 c5 {And already on move three we are out of the databases, I checked after the game. maybe this is bad since white can push his e pawn here but I was willing to try the resulting position. The point behind c5 is to 1. deny white d4 and 2. to play on the queenside. if white were to play e5 here I would maybe play Nd5!? and if the knight exchanges then good centre pawns. } 4. d3 {d4 would transpose into some form of a sicilian.} d5 {I wanted to play Nc6 here but I figured it was pushing the whole non-normal play strategy I like to play at times. This gives a square at d7 for the f knight and strikes at the center to force a descision from white. Now the position looks like something that could be in the databases. possibly some sort of french like position. } 5. Bg5 Be7 {It's important to break the pin before white plays e5.} 6. Be2 {Now I spent about 10 minutes calculating 6...b5!? 10 minutes I could have done with later in the game if only for ease of mind. The pawn would be immune from capture since ...b5 7.Nxb5 Qa5+ 8.Nc3 d4 wins the knight. however I wasn't so sure about other lines like 7.e5 Ng8!? 8.Bxe7 Nxe7 or 7.exd } Nc6 {In the end I firgured it's best not to go down any unusual roads just yet. } 7. O-O {Now that white is castled b5 is impossible.} h6 {At this point I thought descisions had to be made about how the game would proceed, white has neglected to play e5 or to clarrify the situation in the centre, since white is not going to do so then I will. But first I thought I would put the question to the bishop before closing up the position with d4 and e5. } 8. Bd2 {And now to gain central space and close the position ready for my queenside attack} d4 9. Nb1 {Probably best, white aims to redirect the knight to c4 via Na3} e5 {consistent with blacks plans plus now I have also opened up the way for my LSB Because of the closed nature of the position I wanted to play Bg4 and trade it for the f3 knight, otherwise I would keep it for keeping an eye on the a2-g8 diagonal with ...Be6} 10. Na3 {an interesting decision, there are some clear imbalances in the position with opportunities for both sides, white could have played h3 but chose not to. black has more central and queenside space and will probably look for a c4 break, white will need to eventually seek counterplay on the opposite wing (the king side) however there is also an option when fighting against space to prove that the advances leaves weaknesses in the space gainers position. by playing this white shows he is not concerned about a bishop for knight trade since it will leave black with some serious light square problems. } Bg4 {At the time I played this nearly instantly, however Be6 may have been better. I thought though that this was the only way to protect my e pawn after Nc4 but this is not true at all, this move is probably bad as this is my good bishop however trading it for a knight is maybe alright.  } 11. Nc4 {Thematic however White had a good option that I missed during the game. 11.Ne1! since white will eventually want to move the knight anyway to make way for the f pawn it makes perfect sense to do it now. On top of that it proposes a trade of light square bishops which is in whites favour and white black would probably need to move play Be6 anyway which means white would have won about 2 tempo which is very important in an opposite wing attack situation. if I had played 10...Be6 last move I could have met this Nc4 with 11...Bd6 which for some reason never crossed my mind during the game, black will be very happy to trade DSB for whites knight so it would have made good sense. } Bxf3 {This is practically forced now.} 12. Bxf3 {gxf3?! trying to open a kingside file and adding some fuel to the eventual f4 advance would be bad since since black can take advantage of the weak f4 square with Nh5! } b5 13. Na3 {Ok so I had achieveed what I had wanted though this is because I had seriously misjudged the problems involved with exchanging my good bishop, but I have something to work with, will blacks queenside attack be enough to win the position? that remains to be seen.} a6 {I'm not sure if this was the best way to protect the b pawn or not, probably Qb6 or Rb8 would have been better since they allow for the a pawn to play a7-a5 in one move. Actually with the white knight on a3 sacing a pawn with the immediate c4 was also a possibility looking to get a bit of activity. } 14. Nb1 {I didn't actually realise until after the game that this knight was actually hampering my c4 advance since white would have two on c4 so I'm not even sure how I would have gone about preparing for it. I think this move is bad, not just for that reason but also because it moves a knight that has moved several times and isn't even going to any better squares, I mean where is the knight planning to go from here? during the game I thought white may have tried 14.c4!? but after the game I thought that 14.c4 wasn't actually so great, perhaps someone can tell me weather 14.c4 would have been good bad or interesting for white and why.} c4 {now that the white knight has moved I can continue on my merry way. Blacks plans are progressing alot faster than whites kingside counterattack due to some fluffing around by white however I see no real advantage yet. the idea with these space gaining wing advances is usually to 1.earn space 2.create targets to attack, usually backward or isolated pawns and 3. to break through with open files for the heavy pieces to infiltrate the enemy position. Here I figured blacks most likely plan would be to exchange on d3 then pressure it with Nf6-d7-c5 and possibly Nc6-a7-b5 after more pawn advances and to seek play down the c file. Another option with the person with space has is to win by simply constricting the opponents leaving them with little or know play until they suffocate in their own position.} 15. a3 {I'm not too sure if this really improved whites position} cxd3 16. cxd3 a5 {I played this to prevent white playing b4 himself and also had some vauge ideas about perhaps playing an eventual b5-b4 but that will probably never be a good move in the likely positions. } 17. Be2 {Making way for the f pawn so that white can finally get the kingside attack underway. } g5 {?! I had been on the verge of playing somthing reasonable like ...0-0 or ...Nd7 when I remembered a saying "The side with more space should play to constrict enemy pieces" and also the idea of calmly preventing any enemy counterplay. So I played this to stop white from playing the f3-f4 advance however this weakens my kings position, weakens my already light squares even more than they already are and on top of that white can either prepare the f4 advance with g3 which works since the centre is closed or simply undermine my pawns later with h4.} 18. Qb3 Qb6 {was this best?} 19. a4 {! good move that I underestimated, this forces a decision to be made by black, My candidate moves here were, 1.b5-b4 2.Rb8 and 3.Bb4 I didn't like ...Bb4 because of 20.axb Qxb5 (Bxd2 21.Nxd2 covers the white queen.) because white seems to get a bit of play happening. Rb8 ran into the same sort of problem. so I went with ...b4 however this is because I missed whites next move} b4 {I realised that this gives me some serious light square problems however I thought it would take many turns for white to take advantage of this, however whites next move causes all sorts of problems.} 20. Na3 {Na3! after this move I started realising I may have overextendid myself and that I hadn't been playing very correctly at all. b5 and especially c4 and even d5 plus f5 and h5 are all very weak for black. White is also closer to taking controling the c file than black who was supposed to be using it. blacks only real positive feature is the amount of space I owned, and maybe having the two knights in the semi closed position. white might just have an advantage here.} Nd7 {I need to challenge whites knight which will land on c4 by getting my own knight to b6 which is currently taken up by my poorly placed queen. this move threatens whites knight puts my knight one step closer to all the action and has wanted to be played for a while.} 21. Nb5 {? this is an outright mistake by white possibly even a blunder this move looks alright however this knight is easily challenged, and is now stuck on b5 which isn't controlling any important squares. Nc4 was much better which threatns some pawns and attacks my queen and importantly doesn't leave the knight trapped. } Nc5 {since this knight no longer needs to challenge a knight on c4 I use it to attack the queen and now it attacks the b3 square and the pawn on d3, it also blocks whites access to the c file until I am ready to properly contend it. 0-0 and Na7 were also serious considerations.} 22. Qc4 {Qd5 looses a pawn to Nxa4.   Edit, as tiger_lilov points out Qd5 would be alright for white since ...Nxa4?? Rxa4 the queen is protecting the knight on b5.} O-O {still no rush to play Na7, the white knight is trapped where it is and in the mean time this move connects my rooks } 23. Rfc1 {Allows ...Nb3 ideas for black however there isn't a whole lot of moves white can look to play at the moment. maybe Bg4 preventing a rook landing on c8 would be better or perhaps Bh5 keeping an eye on f7} Na7 {forces a knight trade} 24. Nxa7 {The only move} Rxa7 {In thought this was better than QxN since it brings my rooks closer to doubling up} 25. Bh5 {? a mistake that allows a queen exchange, Bg4 was slightly better that stops a rook landing on c8 and also prevents ...Qe6 as well as potentiall landing the bishop on f5. White will have to make something happen on the kingside so perhaps something like g3 preparing either a h4 or f4 advance was best} Qe6 {! Now I suspect that black is better since white either has to accept an exchange of queens or else lose the exchange.} 26. Qb5 {This move seems a little suspect to me, but then white probably missed my follow up.} Rb7 {! if white takes on a5 he looses the exchange and Qc4 is favourable for black.} 27. Qxa5 Nb3 28. Qd5 {The only move} Qxd5 29. exd5 {I had a bit of a dilema here, which piece do I take ...Nxc1 obviously isn't best, but do I take the rook at a1 or the bishop on d2? after ...Nxd2 white can trap my knight with Bd1 so I chose to take the rook.} Nxa1 30. Rxa1 {Bd1 may have been slightly better.} Rc7 {?! Wrong rook. Rfc8 may have been slightly better. } 31. Bd1 {good move, I had missed whites idea of covering all entry points into the only open file with is bishops. although black probably has a slim edge white is far from lost. the two bishops are reasonably strong and the extra the pawns are better.} f5 {? I dont know what on earth I was thinking here. Probably about an eventual e4 break but first there needed to be preperations. 31...b3! was about the only correct move in the position. After anything else the win gets much more difficult as white can play Bd1-b3 and from b3 -c4 if he wants, after white achieves that set up he might even have a bit of an edge himself.} 32. f3 {Hampering the central break as well as allowing for possible g2-g4 ideas} b3 {?? a move that was pretty much necsacarry a move before is now a blunder that could have caused me all sorts of problems. since black has played ...f5 the a2-g8 diagonal is now a problem. Bxb3! now would win a pawn outright for since white threatns a discovered check. Actually it is not as bad as I origionally thought during the game after I played the move since black cqn follow up with Rb7 however white is much more comfortable after 33.Bxb3! Rb7 34.Bc4 Bd6 (or Kg7) 35.b3 and white with two pawns, connected passed pawns for the exchange may even have the winning chances.} 33. a5 {? luckily white missed all this and I could breathe a sigh of relief. } Rb8 {freaked out that I missed all that the move before I played this as soon as it was my turn before looking at any other possibilities. Kg7 should be taken into consideration} 34. a6 Ra7 35. Kf2 Bb4 {I wanted to get rid of the annoying bishop pair which would also mean I could set my sights of infiltrating along the c file and winning the a pawn.} 36. Bc1 {now white is passive and black should be able to bring home the ein without too mush difficulty.} Bd6 {I had thought about Rb6 but first thought I would play this, if white tried to repeat the position with Bd2 I would simply play Rb6 on the two fold. ...Bc3!? is interesting but I dont think it really accomplishes anything. } 37. Ke2 Rb6 38. Ra4 Bb4 {!? Oddly enough I never even considered the obvious Raxa6} 39. Bxb3 Raxa6 40. Rxa6 Rxa6 41. Bc4 Rd6 {I didn't want to give white the chance to play d6+ followed by Be6} 42. Kf2 Kf8 43. h3 {again This might or might not improve whites position, I'm not too sure if it does though. } Rd7 {The rook aims to infilrtate down the now open a file, the other plan is to play for the e5-e4 advance. It's because of these two weaknesses that black has very good winning chances. if black did not have the e5-e4 option then the win would probably much more difficult if possible at all.} 44. Ke2 Ke7 45. Kf2 Ra7 46. Ke2 Kd6 47. Kd1 Ra1 48. Kc2 Ra7 {now that I tested the waters I set about preparing for my central break, ...Kc5 was also a consideration which puts e4 on the board in one move.} 49. Kb3 {?! moving the king away from the action my bishop has enough squares to easily avoid the king whilst still giving me time to make the prepatory moves.} Be1 50. Kc2 Re7 {e4 cant really be prevented } 51. Kd1 Bb4 52. Ke2 Kc5 53. Bb3 e4 54. fxe4 fxe4 55. dxe4 Rxe4+ {Now with this final breakthrough blacks rook can reach its potential and blacks winning chances are significant. } 56. Kf3 {?? This last blunder was the final nail in the coffin.  White had to try Kd3 since it the only move that doesn't lose the DSB. Though truth be told Kd3 Re1 Bd2 Bxd2 Kxd2 paints a pretty grim picture for white. } Re1 57. Bxg5 hxg5 58. Kg4 Bd2 59. g3 d3 60. h4 gxh4 61. gxh4 Bc1 62. h5 Bxb2 63. h6 d2 {Ok so maybe  maybe my play wasn't the very best but it was enough to win, at any rate I think I have advanced beyond the 1100 odd level that my OTB rating would suggest.Ayway hope you enjoyed and please leave plenty of comments. }
