1. d4 {Hi everyone,  This has been a day of two halves for me.  It was a cloudy morning which matched my results.  I found myself writing resignation notes to two opponents, one of them Master Freddy in this game today.  I decide to kick off with 1. d4. } Nc6 2. Nf3 d6 3. e4 {3. e4 - trying to consolidate in the centre.} Nf6 4. Nc3 {4. Nc3 - all four knights developed.  It is a bit like a Pirc Defense.} g6 5. Bb5 a6 6. Bxc6+ bxc6 {6. ...... bxc6 - bishop for knight trade.} 7. O-O Bg7 8. e5 {8. e5 - maybe Re1 might have been stronger here.} Nd5 9. Nxd5 cxd5 {9. ...... cxd5 - knight trade.} 10. exd6 {10. exd6 - again was Re1 better?} Qxd6 11. c3 {11. c3 - closes off the diagonal of Freddy's dsb.} Bg4 12. Qd3 {12. Qd3 - unpin.} f6 13. Re1 O-O 14. Nd2 Bf5 15. Qg3 Qxg3 16. hxg3 {16. hxg3 - queen trade.} e5 17. dxe5 fxe5 {17. ...... fxe5 - pawn trade.  Freddy now says that I must beware of his pawn centre.} 18. f3 h5 19. Nf1 {19. Nf1 - freeing up Fou Lenoir and adding a defense to my pawn on g3.} c6 20. Bg5 {20. Bg5 - Fou Lenoir develops to g5 now that the f pawn has moved to the e column and the h pawn has advanced from h6.  The rooks are now connected.} Bd3 21. Rad1 e4 22. fxe4 dxe4 {22. .... dxe4 - Freddy's pawn centre has been broken but that e pawn is gonna be awkward.} 23. Be3 Rab8 24. Rd2 {24. Rd2 - protecting my b2 pawn.} Rf5 25. Nh2 {25. Nh2 - here Freddy suggests that g4 would have been better.} Rfb5 26. g4 Rb5xb2 27. Rxb2 Rxb2 28. gxh5 gxh5 {28. ....... gxh5 - after the dust has settled, although I have exchanged off my weakie double ton on the g column I have lost my b2 pawn.  Now my a2 pawn is about to go caput.} 29. Rc1 Rxa2 30. Nf1 {30. Nf1 - becoming short of good moves here.} Be5 31. Nd2 Rb2 32. Kf2 a5 {32. ..... a5 - Freddy's a passer is very formidable and dangerous indeed.} 33. Ke1 Bg3+ {33. ....... Bg3+ - Freddy puts the squeeze on.} 34. Kd1 Ra2 35. Bg5 {35. Bg5 - I'm very near to zugzwang her.} Bf2 36. Bf4 e3 {36. ....e3 - the killer, the only way to avoid getting Freddied by e2# is to give up Fou Lenoir.  I wave the white flag, little did I know that a few hours later I would be presented with a ray of hope ......}
