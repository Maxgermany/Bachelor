1. e4 {My usual e4.} e6 {Unusual reply, blocks in bishop on c8.} 2. d4 {Occupying and controlling the centre.} d5 3. Bd3 a6 {This doesn't do anything, better to develop.} 4. Bf4 c5 {Threatens my other pawn, offering a swap.} 5. c3 {I protect.} Bd7 6. Nd2 Nc6 {Developing.} 7. Ngf3 {In a castling position. Notice that my opponent has not developed any of his kingside pieces.} c4 8. Bc2 b5 9. O-O h6 {Again, this does nothing, should be opening up kingside pieces.} 10. Qe2 {I protect the pawn with my queen in order to play b3.} Nf6 {Finally, my opponent develops his queenside knight.} 11. e5 {But, as it is already the middle game, the knight is vulnerable and open to threats.} Nh7 {Nh5 is more attacking.} 12. b4 a5 {En passent ignored.} 13. a3 a4 {Two advanced pieces, this could cause trouble.} 14. Qd1 {Wanting to threaten the knight with Qb1.} Be7 {Now my opponent can castle.} 15. Qb1 {Threatening the knight.} Nf8 16. h3 Bg5 {I didn't understand this move, maybe wanting to expose my kingside flank after 17. Bxg5 hxg5 18. ???? g4.} 17. Bxg5 hxg5 18. Re1 Qe7 {Wanting to castle queenside, the kingside is dangerous with the h-pawn gone.} 19. Kf1 O-O-O 20. Ng1 {Wanting to play g4 to stop my opponent playing g4, I protect the h-pawn.} g4 {But I'm too late.} 21. hxg4 Rh1 {My knight is pinned to my king.} 22. Re3 {Wanting to play Rh3.} Qh4 {Can't play it anymore, and my opponent is threatening Qh2.} 23. Ndf3 {I threaten the queen and stop my opponent from playing Qh2.} Qxg4 24. Bd1 Qe4 {Now, the mistake! My opponent said he accidently played his queen one square too far. But this is not a fatal mistake, he will be -5 down, but its possible to come back from there. One of my friends won a game when he was -14 down, although the two players weren't very good. :)  1. a3 d5 2. b3 b5 3. f4 e6 4. c3 Qh4+ 5. g3 Qd8 6. g4 Bb7 7. b4 d4 8. cxd4 Qxd4 9. Nf3 Qxa1 10. e3 Qxb1 11. Bxb5+ c6 12. Ne5 cxb5 13. h4 Bxh1 14. Kf2 Na6 15. Kg1 Qe4 16. Qf1 Rc8 17. Qxb5+ Kd8 18. Qd7# 1-0  It was quite a pathetic game. } 25. Rxe4 dxe4 {My opponent is -4 down.} 26. Ng5 {I threaten Nxf7 Re8 Nd6+} Ng6 27. Nxf7 Rf8 {Threatens my knight, but I can still check the king and win a pawn.} 28. Nd6+ Kc7 29. Nxb5+ {Free pawn, checks the king again.} Kb6 30. Nd6 {Pawn fork.} Nf4 {A nothing move.} 31. Nxc4+ Kb5 32. Nd6+ Kb6 33. Qxe4 {Another free pawn.} Nd5 34. c4 Nc3 {Fork.} 35. c5+ Kc7 36. Nb5+ {I made a mistake as well, not seeing or forgetting about the knight on c3, I accidently suicide my knight.} Nxb5 {Still +5.} 37. Bxa4 Nc3 {Another fork.} 38. Qc2 {I protect the  bishop and threaten the knight.} Nxa4 39. Qxa4 Nxd4 {Free pawn and threatens my queen.} 40. Qa7+ Kc6 41. Qb6+ Kd5 42. Qd6+ {I am checking the king repeatedly.} Ke4 43. Re1+ {Instead of taking the rook right away, I decide to check the king again.} Kf5 {I think Kd3 would've been better.} 44. Qxf8+ {I capture the rook, and yet again, check the king.} Kg6 {Now I can't check the king again!} 45. Qd6 Bc6 46. Qxd4 {Free knight.} Bd5 47. Qg4+ {Check, yet again.} Kf7 {Retreats. } 48. Ke2 {Wanting to get out my knight, I move my king out of the way of the pin and he resigns. Jekingsr could've come back, but kind of gave up after losing his queen, so never give up.
