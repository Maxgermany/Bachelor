[Opening "Sicilian defence (B30)"]

1. e4 {The game begins with a King pawn opening, where tactics can develop quickly for both sides. } c5 {Black chooses a Sicilian, an opening that provides the most fight to the move [1.e4]. } 2. Nf3 {This is the mainline of the Sicilian Opening. } Nc6 {This has been a preference of mine lately. I like the center control provided by the knight and it also provides a shield against a future [Bf1-b5]. } 3. Bc4 {This is a variation of the Sicilian, of which I do not know the name. I would call it a 3.Bc4 Sicilian. To me it looks like it will turn to an open Sicilian where the center opens up through pawn exchanges. } e6 {I choose a Paulsen pawn formation which has served me well against this type of opening. The text move has the advantage of blocking the bishop pressure at f7 and controlling d5 so that the b1 knight can not be developed there later. } 4. g3 {The text move is not good for white because it provides no benefits, but it does weaken the pawn structure king-side. A better idea is to play [4.0-0] instead, which if played then there is no worry about black playing [4...Qg5] to attack the g2 pawn. Normally the pawn is defended while the bishop remains at f1, but since the bishop has been committed to c4, protection of the g2 pawn must be considered. Notice how moving the g pawn also affects the knight at f3 which now must be protected, which keeps the queen tied to this duty, which takes away queen mobility.} Na5 {This is a move I tend to play against the bishop in this opening. The obvious idea is to exchange by NxB to obtain the bishop advantage (having both bishops, while the opponent does not). A small positional advantage can be obtained if white plays [5.Be2] due to the cramped position for white, and a tempo is gained because after the bishop retreat it is black who plays with the initiative - which allows black another move towards catching up in development. } 5. d3 {Supporting the bishop, but allowing the exchange. } Nxc4 {Black gains the bishop advantage with this move and will seek to exchange pawns later so the bishops can become more active. } 6. dxc4 {This pawn formation creates a sort of bind for black who has to work to remove the bind at some point. } d6 {This move serves many purposes: to keep the knight from developing to e5, to allow [...Ng8-f6] by protecting against [e4-e5], to protect the c5 pawn, and to obtain a little more space. The d7 pawn when left in place can be constrictive and may allow some successful knight attacks by white. } 7. O-O {Now white just needs to develop 3 pieces from the back rank (Q,B,N) for complete development. Black needs to develop (0-0,N,B,Q,B), and so must make each move count for the following moves. } Be7 {The text move is played to prevent the immediate [8.Bg5] which if played next would lose a piece for white [8.Bg5 Bxg5  9.Nxg5 Qxg5  10.Qxd6 Qe7]. So white must choose another move. } 8. Nc3 {A good developing move. } Nf6 {Now [9.Bg5] is possible without losing a piece, but the text move is necessary so that black can castle and complete development. Black by playing the order bishop, then knight, is able to castle first without having to deal with any possible [BxN] exchange. Note that developing the bishop before knight is possible only because white can not play [Qd1-g4] to attack the g7 pawn - due to the knight blocking the queen line. } 9. e5 {An attacking move which does not look bad because after [9...dxe5  10.Nxe5] there is some pressure on the black position. The downside of this move is that after an exchange some central control is given up by white. } dxe5 10. Nxe5 {Notice there is no danger in a queen exchange for black because the queen is guarded by the bishop. } O-O {Black continues the plan for development. The position is about equal, with the difference of the open pawn structure for the white castle. Its not something that can be taken advantage of easily by black after the queen exchange, so white is okay. } 11. Qxd8 {Before the queen exchange material was even from a point count, but every exchange should start to favor black eventually because of having the bishop advantage. Better was [11.Qe2] to move the queen off the back rank and continue development, and to control the squares (e4,g4) to keep them from the f6 knight. } Rxd8 {Notice that the result of the exchange is that black has a strong positional plus of having the only rook that is on an open file. This is something to keep in mind when calculating an exchange - where do the pieces end up afterwards. The position is not open enough for black to obtain the best use of the bishops, so white still has some chances to use the knights which work best against bishops when there are more pawns on the board. } 12. Be3 {The text move puts pressure on c5. The move [12.Bf4?] loses tempo from [12...Nh5]. } Nd7 {The text move offers a knight exchange which will remove the pressure from the e5 knight. White must choose to exchange or retreat the knight. A benefit of retreat is that 2 knights can be stronger than just a knight and bishop. This is a consideration when playing against 2 bishops. This is a generalized reason, but it could be a favorable choice for white in the long term. } 13. Nxd7 {Perhaps better is [13.Nd3] which applies more pressure to c5 and blocks the file from the d8 rook. } Bxd7 {The text is an awkward development of the bishop, but is necessary to tie the rooks. and it has an idea behind it of developing the bishop to c6 where it best developed for control of the a8-h1 diagonal. At this point in the game my strategy was to find the best placement of my pieces, and the bishop looks good on the a8-h1 diagonal, especially considering the pawn structure of the white castle. } 14. f4 {This move is not the best. Notice for white how the pawns are on the same color as the bishop? This takes away mobility of the bishop which makes it less useful.  A bishop that can not move becomes a bad bishop. Perhaps better would be to use the pawn majority on the queen-side to create a pawn storm. A goal would be to seek an exchange of a pawn from the c file so the pawns will not be doubled, and also if possible try to get a pawn promotion in the end. Lately I have started looking at the board from a pawn point of view where you can play in the center, king-side, or queen-side. You can look for play in one of those areas, or sometimes in two of them. Typically you use the pawns on the opposite side of the board from where you castled because they are not guarding the king. } Bc6 15. a4 {It is good to use the pawns on the queen-side, but maybe better is to first move the knight from where it blocks the c2 pawn. Then the pawn advance [c2-c3] will support [b2-b4] to entice an exchange of [...cxb4] so the c pawn is undoubled by [cxb4]. And if black notices the plan and plays [...a7-a5], then there is the move [a2-a3] and white will be successful in the exchanges. } Rd7 {Black seeks to make the rooks more useful by doubling them up on the d file. When there are no tactical or attacking moves available then it is good to make moves that strengthen your position. } 16. b3 {An interesting formation has formed where the queen-side pawns work against blacks white squared bishop, and the pawns king-side work against blacks black squared bishop. The white queen-side pawns are now mostly without mobility. It appears that white has no attacking ideas, and it is hard to suggest attacking ideas in this position. The placement of each piece in the opening makes a big difference in the quality of your middle and end game - so it is good to have a middle/end-game plan for each opening that you like to play. } a6 {This move prevents [Nc3-b5] and is made to make the opponents knight less useful. } 17. h4 {This move creates a backwards pawn at g3, which can be a problem if a rook is placed on the g file. Of course the g pawn is safe for the moment. } Rad8 {Continuing the plan of doubling the rooks. Notice how the prior move by black prevents the knight from gaining access to the a7 square - where it would attack the c6 bishop. } 18. f5 {Seeking to open up the position and bring the rook into the attack of c5. Not the best move because of the tactic that black has available of [18...Bf6!], which loses the knight or rook. Better is [18.Ra1-d1] where the rook is backed up by the f1 rook and the knight. If the knight is later attacked by [18...Bf6], then [19.Rxd7 Rxd7  20.Ne2] and the knight is safe. } Bf6 {Black creates a counter-attack which keeps the pawn at c5 safe due to the attack on the c3 knight. Notice the pin on the knight prevents it from moving without losing the rook. } 19. Ne2 {This is the best method to lose material because the alternative [19.Rd1 Bxc3] is -3 pts, and the text move [19.Ne2 Bxa1  20.Rxa1] results in -2 pts, and allows a piece recapture.} Bxa1 20. Rxa1 {A quick positional assessment shows that there are bishops of opposite colors, which means that there is some potential for reaching a draw typically. But the material difference will make that less likely. White has a pawn majority queen-side, and black does on the king-side. Both players should try to centralize the king usually, but in this game the 2 rooks will make that difficult for white. A strategy for white may be to try and create a fortress on the queen-side for the king after exchanging pawns king-side. For black the best strategy is to make the most of the rooks, perhaps by [...Rd1 ], to exchange rooks for a greater advantage. } Rd7d1+ 21. Rxd1 Rxd1+ {The end result of the strategy is that black has a rook on the 8th rank where it can attack the queen-side pawns. } 22. Kf2 b6 {Protecting c5. } 23. Nc1 {A good move (!) that prevents the rook from getting behind the pawns. Nicely done! } Rd8 {The rook has nothing more to attack and moves to a better position. Note that [23...Rd6] is met with [24.Bf4]. The text move appears the best choice. } 24. Bg5 {Its an attack, but does not gain an advantage due to [24...f6], and it loses the f5 pawn. Better was [24.fxe6]. } f6 25. Be3 exf5 {Taking advantage of the tempo gained - black captures the pawn before [fxe6] can be played. } 26. b4 {A risky move which attempts to make doubled black pawns by [26...cxb4]. It has the unfortunate aspect of hanging the a4 pawn. } Kf7 {The text move (?) is not the best choice. Better was [26...Bxa4]. } 27. bxc5 {A good move (!) - 2 pawns for the price of one because of the bishop at e3. } bxc5 28. Bxc5 Bxa4 {Unfortunately for white the hanging a4 pawn loses some of the advantage of the pawn exchanges. } 29. c3 {For safety of the pawn. } Rc8 {Now there is an unfortunate position for white where there are 3 hanging pieces lined up in a file. This is taken advantage of by the rook. } 30. Nd3 {A good try, but this move enables black to create two attacks. Better was [30.Bd4]. } Bc2 31. Ne1 {Good counter-play (!). Always try to use it. } Rxc5 {Black is okay with losing the bishop because the material advantage becomes stronger by exchanges. } 32. Nxc2 Rxc4 {The rest of the game is played using the rook advantage with the idea of promoting the a6 pawn. } 33. Nd4 Rxc3 34. Nxf5 a5 {The check on the next move is allowed by black with the idea of pushing the pawn to promotion. The king will be able to move to safety and there are no forks or secondary moves that will cause problems afterwards. } 35. Nd6+ Ke6 {Moving towards the center. Also possible was [35...Kf8] where it takes 3 knight jumps to check the king. The text move is better because the king will be centralized for more board control. When playing against knights there are certain squares you can use to your advantage. Like in this position, observe the squares (c6,d7,d5,e6) require 2 knight moves to attack these squares, and the squares (c7,c5,e7,e5) require 1 knight move to be attacked, and also note the safest squares (b8,b4,f8,f4) which takes 3 knight moves to be attacked. If you look at the square colors relative to the knight you can see how most black squares can be attacked in 1 move, and most white squares in 2 moves. } 36. Ne4 {Attacking the rook. } Rc8 {The alternative move [36...Rc2 ] is not so good because the king can begin to maneuver towards the rook which will cause it to have to move to remain safe. The text move is best because the rook is far enough from king and knight attacks. Note that the idea is to use the rook to prevent the king from reaching the pawn on the a file. White could try to use the knight as a shield to step past the rook, but it would take some time. } 37. Nd2 {Its hard to get at the pawn due to the rook placement and because an outside passed pawn is a difficult target for a knight. } a4 38. Nb1 {Hoping to blockade the pawn at a3 or maybe exchange the knight for pawn later to prevent the pawn promotion. } Rb8 {The rook attacks with the idea of forcing the knight away and then the pawn can continue the journey. } 39. Na3 {The knight blockades the pawn, but unfortunately there is no support and the rook will be able to chase it again. } Rb3 40. Nc4 {A good try in the circumstance. } Rc3 {Chasing the knight to gain the a3 square.} 41. Nd2 {Now the pawn can go a bit further. } a3 42. Nb1 {It looks like black will lose either rook or pawn, but there is an intermezzo (an in-between move) which will allow both to be kept. } Rc2+ {The text move (!) gives black the opportunity to move the rook and the pawn to safety.} 43. Kf3 a2 44. Na3 {There are no saving moves for white. } Rc3+ 45. Kf4 Rxa3 {Black Resigned. The most important themes in this game were piece safety, tactics, calculation, B vs N, good piece placement, pawn structures, open files, square control. Getting better at chess is like a roller coaster ride. While you are learning you tend to focus on certain aspects of the game while losing sight of other aspects - which is normal. Its good to try and improve each area to its fullest, and you will find yourself collecting stronger attributes for your play. }
