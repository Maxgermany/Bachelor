[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 {White is playing the Queen's Pawn Game, and his second move seems to be pushing toward the Stonewall Attack.} 3. c4 e6 {White went a bit off script for the Stonewall. That pawn is usually played to c3 instead of c4. Now it looks like he has transposed into a Queen's Gambit (it's not much of a gambit now with his bishop defending the pawn at c4), maybe the Marshall Defense with the black knight at f6, though an early pawn move to e3 is not really main line for white in the Marshall Defense.} 4. Nf3 Bd6 {Black wants to castle, so the bishop move clears the way. I considered 4. ... Bb4, but after 5. Bd2 we just end up exchanging bishops. I wanted to keep the position complex, so exhanging pieces early was contrary to my plans in that regard. Of course, white can easily play c5 at any time to drive back my bishop, so e6 might not have been the wisest choice for black here.} 5. Nc3 O-O 6. Bd3 dxc4 {I decided not to let white play his pawn to c5. After white's last move, taking the pawn now seems to gain a little tempo.} 7. Bxc4 c5 {This move is contrary to my intention of keeping things complicated, giving white a chance to trade queens if he wants simplification. But I felt I needed to challenge his center.} 8. O-O cxd4 {White castled into a little trap, and now I'll present him a little teaser where what seems to be the best move will cost him a pawn - one of his castle pawns, which leaves his king somewhat exposed (and this will play a role later in the middle game).} 9. Nxd4 Bxh2+ {White can choose not to capture the bishop. Either way, he has already lost a pawn with no recompense.} 10. Kxh2 Qc7+ {Long range fork. Check, and the bishop on c4 will fall.} 11. g3 Qxc4 {Black is up a pawn and he has ruined white's castle. Of note is the fact that we have opposite colored bishops, and eventually, if white is allowed to exchange everything else off the board, black cannot force a win with K B P vs. K B when the bishops are on opposite colors.} 12. Ndb5 a6 {Black cannot leave the knight on b5 where it is just one move away from c7 where it wins the rook on a8. The black queen defends c7 for now, but she can be easily chased, and being tied to the defense of c7 limits her scope. Also, with a6, black gives his rook freedom to escape if white's knight is ever played to c7.} 13. Nd6 Qc5 {d6 dangerous place for the white knight. It has no credible threats, and it can be easily attacked. As I noted after black's 11th move, black is in favor of white playing Nxc8 as that eliminates the opposite colored bishop ending.} 14. a4 Rd8 {I don't know what the pawn on a4 is good for. Perhaps white was thinking about playing his rook to b3 to threaten black's pawn on b7. But his knight is still in a precarious position, and now I pin it there. White seems to have no escape. If 15. Nxb7 or 15. N(d6)e4, to threaten black's queen, black can play 15. ... Rxd1 and now white's rook is en prise and white loses material. It's interesting to note how destructive 9. ... Bxh2  was to white's position. If white's king stood next to his rook on f1, white's knight could escape this pin and even win the pawn on b7 (black couldn't play 15. Bxb7? for white wins a rook with Qxd8 ).} 15. Qf3 Rxd6 {Eat the knight before it escapes, especially since now it can capture at b7 guarded by its queen.} 16. Rd1 Rxd1 {Black is ahead by knight and pawn, and more than willing to liquidate pieces. White dubiously offers the first of the liquidations.} 17. Qxd1 Nbd7 {Of course, white has Qd8 , but black's queen can save the day with Qf8. However, this takes black's queen out of the center of the board and puts white on the offensive, so I deem it best to prevent the move, which also serves to broaden my queen's scope once she's not tied to preventing checkmate. In retrospect, I think the better move would have been 17. ... Qh5  to force the trading of queens. } 18. a5 b5 {Opens up my bishop, and I wouldn't mind if white captures en passant.} 19. Ne2 Bb7 {White's 19. Ne2 seems to serve little purpose. It has nowhere to move that presents any threat to black. In fact, it opens up e4, which looks like a great home for a black knight. But I choose a move that might give me an opportunity to pin and exchange white's knight.} 20. b3 Bf3 21. Ba3 Bxe2 {OK, let's exchange. If 22. Bxc5 Bxd1, 23. Rxd1 Nxc5 black comes out a piece ahead, and his rook protects against the back-rank checkmate.} 22. Qxe2 Qh5+ {White played the only move that didn't lose material, and black finally plays the move he should have played 5 moves ago.} 23. Qxh5 Nxh5 {Queens are gone, the opposite-bishop ending has been prevented, and black has a winning material advantage. Time to figure out how to win with it.} 24. Rd1 Ne5 25. Kg2 f6 {This was a bad move by black. I wanted freedom for my king to get off of the bank rank and make himself useful. I wanted to move towards the center, so the f-pawn made sense to me, but 25. ... f5 makes my pawn at e6 backward. However, as played, my knight on h5 is now trapped and falls after 26. f4 and 27. g4.} 26. f4 Nc6 {OK, if I must lose the knight, maybe I can win a couple pawns for it. I anticipate white's next move, but it wins me one pawn after 27. Rd6 Nxa5, 28. Rxe6 Nxb3 and now black has adjacent passed pawns on the a and b files and has extended his material advantage.} 27. Rd6 Nxa5 28. b4 Nc4 {Aha! White fell into my trap, but he missed the other outcome, namely, that his doomed pawn at b3 was required to remain home and suffer the consequences because it prevented this fork. It's not the deadliest fork, since white can avoid losing material with 29. Rd3 Nxa3, 30. Rxa3, but black has just won a pawn, extending his lead, and now exchanges knight for bishop, liquidating more material.} 29. Rxe6 Nxa3 {I guess white missed the saving move, so I'll grab my bonus material. Compensation for my doomed knight on h5.} 30. g4 Nc2 {I could have played 30. ... Nxf4 to capture at least one pawn in exchange for the doomed knight. But I think adjacent passed pawns on the queenside is a better way to gain a pawn. I truly expected white to defend with 31. Re4 which allows my knight to escape his doom with 31. ... f5, 32. Pxf5 Nf6 and now white must save his rook, but all the squares on the 4th rank are covered, so he cannot continue to protect his pawn at b4. End result, an even exchange of pawns and black's knight escapes with that deadly pair of passed pawns on the queenside.} 31. gxh5 Nxb4 {Maybe white figured out the combination I just described and decided on the move that wins him material. Either way, black has now accomplished his overwhelming advantage on the queenside, and white is doomed.} 32. f5 Kf7 33. Kg3 a5 {The kingside is locked. Time to promote a pawn (or two).} 34. Kg4 a4 35. h6 g6 {Not 35. ... Pxh6? 36. Kh5 Kg7, 37. Re7  and now black must lose both H-pawns and white gains a pawn majority and a strong attack on the kingside. The move as played retains the lock, blocking white's king's advance. Of course, white cannot capture at g6 because he loses his rook, and even with another capture at h7, he cannot promote his passed pawns due to black's rook on a1.} 36. Rb6 Nd5 {The only move to defend the b5 pawn was 36. ... Ra5, tying my rook to dfense and allowing white a probable draw with perpetual check Rb7  and Rb8  (if black moves away from g6, white threatens to promote a pawn with Pxb6). Black might be able to stave off destruction after 36. ... Ra5, 37. Rb7  Ne2, but 38. Pxg6 thratens to promote a white pawn. I think black can hold out with 38. ... Kxg6 and now white has no more attacks to dislodge the black king. However, I am worried that I might have overlooked something and it just seems imprudent to allow white to play for that combination when it can be prevented. As played, I can now save my pawn with 37. ... b4. White must move his rook, it is en prise. And no matter what he does, black can play 37. ... Nxe3 .} 37. Rxb5 Nxe3+ {White exchanged pawns, as expected. But now black's knight has a second fork against king and pawn.} 38. Kf4 Nxf5 {And now black's kingside is perfectly secure, white has no perpetual check while black can safely hide on his own back rank, or safely block with his knight. And black's pawn at a4 is clear to advance.} 39. Rb7+ Kg8 {White stalled, and now he's out of steam. White probably wants to get his king into the center, to block the black knight's best squares and to try to support his rook in stopping the advancing black pawn, but he is blocked from approaching the center (without going all the way down through f3 to e2, unless he moves his rook to a safer square first. } 40. Ke4 Nd6+ {And now white commits his ultimate sin, and black is unwilling to offer mercy. White wanted the center, just like I had expected he would, but he failed to observe the consequences of not going the long way around.} 41. Kd5 Nxb7 42. Ke6 a3 {No need to save a pawn that isn't doing anything when another pawn is busily winning the game.} 43. Kxf6 a2 44. Ke7 Ra6 {White is making it easy on black, approaching an edge of the board. Time for black to limit the white king's range. At this point I announced mate in 5.} 45. Kd7 a1=Q {My opponent didn't return to this game right away, allowing me some free time to explore the Conditional Moves feature. By the time I was done, I had entered 23 combinations that covered every possible avenue of white moves from now through checkmate. A couple days later when I was offline, I received a message that I had won this game by checkmate, and I wasn't even there.} 46. Kc8 Nc5 {Saves the knight and defends the rook from a square the white king cannot reach.} 47. Kc7 Qb2 48. Kc8 Qb7+ 49. Kd8 Ra8# {Final position. 49. ... Qd7   would have also worked, but 22 of my 23 Conditional Move combinations ended with black making the exact same moves from 46 through 49. The only different combination was if white played 46. Ke8 Qf6, 47. Kd7 Qd8   because it was 2 moves faster (hence prettier). On a side note, I wish the Conditional Moves feature allowed some kind of wildcard for my opponent's move, so that I could have essentially said "whatever white plays, I play this one move in response. A feature like that would have allowed me to enter just a single Contitional Move sequence to arrive at this position (white's king might end on e8) instead of entering 23 combinations. In any case, it was a fun exercise to work out all the combinations.}
