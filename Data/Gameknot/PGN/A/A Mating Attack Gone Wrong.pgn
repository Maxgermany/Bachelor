1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Just to let you know that this is round 2 against dynamic_dv, the guy who skewered Glenda to one of my castles in "An Expert Lesson in Tactics".  This game was a classic Sicilian game in which both sides castled on opposite sides and when that happens this means a race involving pawn storms and heavies behind them.  Whoever gets behind in tempo here usually cops Old Matey.  I thought I had a strong attack, indeed it seemed that I had won a pawn.  But, a strong move by the Wicked Witch of the West put paid to all that and I ended up being a pawn down, and in the final position having to give up a second pawn to a knockout combo.  Ah well, at least I felt that I wasn't quite such a doormat in this game, but you the jury may feel something different.  Here we go .......} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd2 a6 8. O-O-O {8. 0-0-0.  The sequence of moves between 1. e4 and now is called the Richter Rauzer Variation of the Sicilian.  It seems like the Sicilian Dragon in that both players castle on opposite sides, etc...  As you can see, all my pieces bar Frere Leblanc are off the back rank and even he flies the coup on move 12.} h6 9. Be3 Bd7 10. f3 b5 11. Nxc6 Bxc6 {11. ........ Bxc6 - this bishop's control over the a8-h1 diagonal will prove decisive in my opponent's favour later on.  Black is mounting a pawn storm already and I think the knight exchange was to try and take some of the sting out of black's attack.} 12. Bd3 Be7 13. Qf2 O-O 14. g4 {14. g4 - I now start a pawn storm on the kingside.  It proves to be a pity that Glenda isn't occupying g2 already.} Nd7 15. h4 b4 16. Ne2 {16. Ne2 - evading black's pawn stab.  This, however, will be a rather unfortunate placement for this knight.  In hindsight Nd4, f4 Nf3 might have been a better plan but do you jury agree?} Ne5 17. h5 Nxd3+ 18. Rxd3 {18. Rxd3 - my rook ends up on a rather unfortunate square.  I decide to keep on with my plan of a kingside mating attack with moving Glenda onto the g file next move and push my g pawn further up the board making contact with the black h pawn.  I miscalculate black's threat big time.} Qc7 19. Qg2 d5 20. g5 dxe4 21. gxh6 {21. gxh6.  If black captures either my rook or my f pawn forking queen and knight he will lose his king to Glenda's kiss of death on g7!} Qe5 22. hxg7 {22. hxg7.  Here I thought that this move was very strong as I calculated the following variations:-  Variation A  22. hxg7 exf3  23. gxf8=Q  Kxf8  24. Bh6  Ke8  25. Qg8  Bf8  26. Qxf8#   Variation B 22. hxg7 Qxg7  23. Qxg7  Kxg7  24. Rg1  Kh7  25. fxe4 Bxe4  26. Rd2   Variation C 22. hxg7 Rfe8  23. h6 Qf5  24. h7  Qxh7  25. Rxh7 Kxh7  26. Rd1 exf3  27. Rh1  Kg8  28. Rh8#   Variation D 22. hxg7 exf3  23. gxf8=Q  Kh7  24. Qxf7  Kh8  25. Bd4 fxg2  26. Bxe5  Bf6  27. Bxf6#   After all these variations I was happy with the positions I would end up with.  But I missed something and Dave is about to show me just what I have been missing, sigh! } exd3 23. gxf8=Q+ Kxf8 24. Bh6+ Ke8 25. cxd3 Rc8 26. Kb1 {26. Kb1 - I just had to get Henry out of the threatened discovery else he would become a widower because that light squared bishop that I talked about in a previous note woud play Bxf3  and I would have to get Henry off the c file and abandon Glenda to her fate.  Moving Henry onto the d file was probably no better as the Wicked Witch would simply snap off my b pawn.} Qf5 {26. .......... Qf5!! - this is the move I overlooked in my calcs, I simply didn't analyse far enough.  Both d and f isolanis are attacked by the Wicked Witch of the West, one is defended by Glenda but also attacked by that pesky lsb and my d pawn is not protected at all.  I try pinning that wretched lsb but it doesn't come off.} 27. Rc1 Qxd3+ 28. Ka1 Kd7 {28. ....... Kd7.  It is a real pity that Glenda was on f1 and not g2 because I could have pinned that witch to her other half with great pleasure but this is not possible.  My knight drops back to defend the f pawn but now my h pawn will drop to a skewer by the enemy rook on h8.} 29. Ng1 Rh8 30. Qd2 Qxd2 31. Bxd2 {31. Bxd2 - the queen swap momentarily reduced black's pressure on my position but this does not cut the mustard as my h pawn now falls.  Shame as it could have been a lovely passer.} Rxh5 32. Rd1 Rd5 33. Kb1 {33. Kb1 - Henry moves back to try and protect his rook and Frere Lenoir.} Bf6 34. Kc1 Bxb2+ 35. Kxb2 Ba4 {35. ......... Ba4 - the b pawn was captured by black's dsb to enable black to move his lsb to this square.  If the b pawn had still been on the board I could have blocked this bishop move.  My rook must move away allowing Frere Lenoir to be taken.  If Henry moves to c1 to try and get two pieces for the rook then Rc5 simply drives Henry back to b1 and the rook falls next move.  Any rook move will result in Frere Lenoir being taken with check and I could well lose a third pawn and his rook will be a bone in the throat.  I therefore decided to wave the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  A sad end to a game of which I had high hopes.}
