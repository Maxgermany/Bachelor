1. d4 Nf6 2. d5 {Bold.} d6 {Halting the pawn's advance.} 3. Nc3 g6 {Usually I do the Queen's Indian Defense when white does e4, but this time I'm going to operate for the King's Indian instead due to present circumstances (meaning e5).} 4. e4 {Building a center and protecting the pawn.} Bg7 5. Bg5 c6 6. Bxf6 Bxf6 7. Qd3 O-O 8. O-O-O cxd5 {Time to challenge the center, I'm thinking.} 9. Nxd5 Bg7 10. Qc4 Nc6 11. h3 {? White needs to develop.} Bd7 12. g4 {Again, white should be developing.} Rc8 {Now my setup is really powerful.} 13. Qd3 e6 {Kicking the knight so that it won't have the opportunity to fork my king and rook on d7 when I need to move my queen.} 14. Nf4 {On first glance, my position is good because I'm fully developed and have a lot of firepower ready against white's king. White, by contrast, is undeveloped and doesn't seem to know what's coming.} Nb4 {The beginning of a great attack. Now white has to worry about both his c and b pawns due to my knight, rook, and DSB. I'm also offering my d-pawn as bait because if white leaves his king without its protection, he's going from being seriously in danger to sealing his fate.} 15. Qxd6 {...bye, white!} Rxc2+ 16. Kb1 Rxb2+ 17. Ka1 {Here I can do a windmill if I wanted to. What I didn't realize is that I also could have checkmated white here with ...Nc2#. Dang. That would have been pretty. In the moment I was looking for the fastest mate and actually missed it to choose this one instead:} Rxa2+ {Obliterating the pawn so white has no protection.} 18. Kb1 Rb2+ {Now if white does Kc1, I do Qc8 and I assume checkmate will follow closely. However, white opts for:} 19. Ka1 {Making my life easier.} Qa5# {}
