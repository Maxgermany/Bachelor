1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 {The "weak move" white should avoid. } e6 {Icelandic. } 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {Here, white is strangely weak. } 5. d4 {Looks good, doesn't it?} Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Ne4 {Here, if Bd2, Qxd4, threatening mate on f2} 7. d5 {A try. } Qf6 {Mate is threatened, while the N is untouchable. Here, white has two moves. The one he played, Qc2, looks ok for the moment, but I wonder to see qhat happens if he plays Qa4+.} 8. Qc2 Nxc3 {White loses this knight or the Rook a1 after Bxc3+.} 9. Bd2 {white now threatens to take back the knigh. It can't go away without exposing the Bb5 to a loss. } Bf5 {If Ba4, b3 was strong. I could have taken the e column with check inmediately (whit can't interpose the dsb with Be3, but it is not a very strong check unless I can further press on e2 with my B and R (after castling). Now, white can try Bd3, and I will consider Ne5 in return. } 10. Qb3 {The only square for the queen to go! Now, both the knight and the bishop are "en prise". } Qe5+ 11. Ne2 {And here my opponent disconnected. I wonder what would have been the rest of the game. } Nxe2 12. Qxb4 Nc3+ 13. Be3 Ne4 14. Qxb7 O-O 15. f4 Qe7 16. Qxa8 Qb4+ 17. Kd1 Qxb2 18. Rc1 Nc3+ 19.
