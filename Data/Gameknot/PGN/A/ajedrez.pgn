Rc6+ {Double attack on king and knight, his knight is defended by the pawn, but his pawn is pinned by the white bishop. If he captures rook with pawn he loses his bishop, if he doesn't he loses his knight and/or more.} Ka5 39. Rxg6 {Using the pin of f7 pawn to my advantage.} fxg6 40. Bxg8 {Game is over at this point. His king takes too long to attack my pawns and succesfully convert one of his pawns to a queen, and he also takes too long to get to my kingside pawns before they turn to a queen.} b4 41. axb4+ Kxb4 42.
