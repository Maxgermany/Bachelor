[Opening "Giuoco Pianissimo (C50)"]

1. e4 {My favourite way to start of a game.} e5 {This is a move that it is quite often countered with.} 2. Nf3 {I then bring my knight out.} Nc6 {My opponent brings his knight out to protect his pawn on e5.} 3. Bc4 {I then do this move because most people do it against me so I thought it is a good move.} Bc5 {Black also brings his bishop out} 4. d3 {I then push my pawn to d3 to protect the pawn and the bishop at the same time and also opening the line of my bishop on c1.} Nf6 {My opponent brings their knight out so that he can castle.} 5. Ng5 {I don't always do this move but sometimes people don't castle putting me in a good position.} O-O {Unfortunately, most people do castle and this is basically a beginning of a game that I have started from many times.}
