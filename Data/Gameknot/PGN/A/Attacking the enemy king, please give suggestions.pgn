1. d4 {I start with my Queen Pawn. } Nf6 {A non-committal move that will transpose into a modern queen pawn defense. } 2. c4 {Following the book. } c5 {2...c5 - the Benoni Defense. } 3. d5 g6 {Refusing to commit to the Modern Benoni (3...e6), Benko Gambit (3...b5), or Czech Benoni (3...e5). } 4. Nc3 a6 {4...a6!? points at the pawn break b7-b5. } 5. e4 {Grabbing more of the center. } d6 {This Benoni sideline looks like a King's Indian Defense with ...c5. } 6. Bg5 Bg7 7. Qd2 {Preparing Bh6. } h6 {I'm not sure what to think of this move. I would give it a ?! } 8. Be3 {Still hoping to trade DSB's. } Nbd7 9. Rb1 {19.Rb1!? Since I think ...b5 is coming, I want to play b3 without worrying about tactics based on the a1-h8 diagonal and place my rook on a file that might open. } O-O {9.O-O? This move overlooks my threat the capture the h6-pawn } 10. Bxh6 {Capturing the loose pawn and forcing a swap of DSB's. } Ne5 {This natural-looking move might be a mistake because it allows me to play f4 with tempo. } 11. Bxg7 {I swap DSB's. } Kxg7 12. f4 Neg4 {This move is a mistake because it allows me to pawn storm with tempo. } 13. h3 {The first tempo, supporting the g2-g4 pawn thrust. } Nh6 14. g4 {Tempo #2: I advance my g-pawn and threaten to fork black's knights. } Nh7 15. g5 {Tempo #3: advancing another pawn with tempo. } Ng8 16. h4 {Continuing the attack. Any alternatives? } e5 {This is an attempt to stop my attack, but it is a mistake because I can en passant the pawn. } 17. dxe6 e.p. Bxe6 {Black recaptures with the bishop. Is 17...fxe6 better? } 18. Nd5 {Adding my knight to the attack. } Bg4 {Trying to prevent the opening maneuver h4-h5. } 19. Be2 {I don't see any other options, so I offer to trade. } Bxe2 20. Qxe2 {Should I have recaptured with the knight? } Ne7 {Trying to trade off my more active knight. } 21. h5 {Continuing the attack. } Nxd5 {Trading off my strong d5-knight. } 22. cxd5 {22.exd5?? would cost me my queen. Now I wish I had castled queenside instead of playing 9.Rb1. } Qa5+ {Wins the pawn back, but my attack continues. } 23. Kf2 Qxa2 24. Nf3 {Connecting my rooks and developing my final piece. Although my knight seems misplaced, I don't see any good alternative. } c4 {This is a very bad move because it allows my knight to join the attack. } 25. Nd4 {Taking advantage of my opponent's mistake. } Rac8 {? Too slow, ignoring my attack. Which move would have allowed black to survive and how could I counter it? } 26. hxg6 {Opening lines into the enemy position } fxg6 {This move loses the exchange but is there an alternative? (26...Kxg6 loses to  27.Qh5+ Kg7 28.Qxh7#) } 27. Ne6+ {Forking the king and rook. } Kg8 28. Nxf8 Rxf8 29. Kg3 {Not sure what I was thinking. Any suggestions for a better move? } c3 30.

RxN KxN e7, when the pawn promotes, or 42...Nf8 43.e7 and the e-pawn promotes. } Kd8 43. exd7 Kxd7 44. f5 gxf5 45. g6 Ke7 46. g7 {Black resigns as he cannot prevent promotion. }
