1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. Nd2 Nbd7 4. Ngf3 c5 5. e3 c4 {Finally I find someone that plays this. I am not sure white can get out of this being ok.} 6. c3 b5 7. a3 a5 {Going with all. Cool blood.} 8. Ne5 {I kind of threat Nc6, which is not a threat at all, but even so, I grab a little space on the board.} Nxe5 {I'd play Qb6 instead. Anyway...} 9. dxe5 Ng8 {It has to be said that after Nd7, I can try e6, and if fxe... nothing serious, but still I have a Qh5+ that can be annoying, after b6, Qe5.} 10. b4 {I have to grab my space taking advantage his dsb is not free. If cxb ep, I'd have the doubt among Qx or Nx, but anyway I kind of break his pawnstorm. } axb4 11. axb4 Rxa1 12. Qxa1 {Now my Q is dislodged, but HIS Qside is weak...} h6 {Maybe wanting to pressure me with the fianchetto. I don't have time for h4, I have to develop. } 13. Nf3 {This is not another piece out, but sincerely, Be2 was just too passive. I threat Nd4, pressing on the b5 pawn. } g5 14. Bg3 {If h5, h3, that was on the agenda all the same. } Bb7 {Big mistake. I should have grabbed the position with Qa7 inmediately, but I played the scheduled....} 15. Nd4 Qd7 {Qb6 was the only move. This is a serious blunder.} 16. Qa5 Bc6 17. Qb6 {There is no way to save the pawn. } Bb7 18. Nxb5 h5 19. Nc7+ {Now, the game is decided.} Kd8 20. e6 {I could have taken the B inmediately, but hey, I have a noak's arc on my own dsb. I have to make room for it, and take advantage of my N.} fxe6 21. Nxe6+ {Beautiful, isn't it?} Ke8 22. Nc7+ Kd8 {Maybe better was Kf7.} 23. Qxb7 Nf6 {Another blunder? Sure...} 24. Qb8+ Qc8 25. Ne6+ {I planned just Kd7, exchange everything and save my dsb. But here there is much more...} Kd7 26. Nc5+ Kd8 27. Bc7+ {...and he loses his Q. A short miniature.}
