1. d4 {a hopeless game when looking at the grade difference but it is always good playing someone who is a grandmaster to learn that tiny bit extra!} b5 {an opening i don't usually play but one i decided to try } 2. e4 {straight into the attack and the control of the centre} c6 {i defend. now imagine if both our queens and kings were the other way around- white would have had a checkmate:)} 3.

Rc8+ {uh} Ke7 {only option} 26. Kf3 {that's prevented my lead but got that king out a bit too early} Nb6 {get that rook outta here} 27. Rc7+ {why?} Nb8d7 {this helps me advance this knight} 28.

Rh8 {hopeless for me} e5 {still advancing} 39. Rxh5 {he'll pull ahead} Ke6 {what can i really do} 40. f5+ {back goes that king} Kd6 {there} 41. h4 {a threat of a queen} b3 {why don't i try and get a queen} 42. Rh8 {gets the rook out the way to advance that pawn} Ne7 {i think must pull my knights back to prevent a queen!} 43.

Kb6 {golly} Kb8 {oooffff} 65. Re8# {here the game comes to a finish with an expected and the inevitable CHECKMATE! what i would have wanted to know was what had i played that mainly caused my loss- queen takes that tempting pawn? or simply the opening i played! dunno! i lost but i definitely learned one thing: never get to conceited or should i say over yourselves when you get in the lead- a quick downfall is always likely! thanks for reading!!}
