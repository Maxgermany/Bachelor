1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I took another trip down memory lane and found another mating attack in my Gameknot Mating Attack cupboard that seemed almost bare.  This game was played a couple of months after the Big Slump and was unrated.  I thought I would put myself in a positive mood for the week ahead as I have got some very tough games in my active games list so that I can hopefully make the right choices.  Anyhow, we now have a Sicilian c3 after I kicked off with 1. e4.} c5 2. c3 {2. c3 - this is the Sicilian c3 and supports a d4 pawn advance from another angle.} Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Bb5 {4. Bb5 - development and clears the way for kingside castling.  Several pawn moves happen first.} Nf6 5. e5 Ng4 6. d4 {6. d4 - clears the way for Fou Lenoir.} Be7 {6. ...... Be7  and black clears the way for castling too.} 7. h3 Nh6 8. Bxh6 gxh6 {8. ....... gxh6 - piece trade opening up the g file.} 9. Nbd2 Qa5 10. Bd3 O-O {10. ...... 0-0 - rather risky castling into an open g file with queens on the board because as you are about to see, Glenda is not always a DEFENDER!} 11. O-O {11. 0-0 - suddenly white is fully developed and castled.} Bg5 {11. ...... Bg5 - tries to cover the g file but black goes in for an injudicious trade on d2.} 12. Qc2 {12. Qc2 - line up on h7 pawn.} Bxd2 13. Qxd2 {11. Qxd2 - piece trade.} cxd4 14. Qxh6 {14. Qxh6 - pawn trade, but not where my opponent thinks -just look where Glenda is - that gal is threatening mate on h7!} f5 15. exf6 e.p. {15. exf6 ep - renewing the mate threat.} Rf7 16. Ng5 {16. Ng5 - black protected his king with Rf7 but I am not to be denied - reinforcements are brought up in the form of a horsie.} Qe5 {16. ...... Qe5 - the Wicked Witch of the West quickly tries to fly in on her broomstick but she cannot save her other half.} 17. Bxh7+ Rxh7 18. Qxh7+ {18.  Qxh7+ - now here is a relatively simple test for you - my opponent resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate -I leave it to you guys to spot the checkmate and send me that pm!  Hope you've had a good weekend all of you!  Bye for now until next time.  Joanne}
