1. e4 {Mini-tournament, I'm playing white and start with the Open Game, my favorite first move.} b6 2. d4 {The Queen's Fianchetto Defense. I haven't seen this one before.} e6 3. Nf3 {2. ... Bb7 is the main line. Instead, black abandons the main line to play toward the Owen's Defense. If white plays 3. Nc3 we reach the Owen's Defense (more common from a side line of the French Defense with 1. e4 e6, 2. d4 b6, 3 Nc3). Owen's Defense is considered by most to be fairly inferior, allowing white to establish and hold a superior center while black falls behind in development. According to Wiki, it's greatest use is surprising opponents who aren't prepared for it, which may be great in a tournament hall, but not so great in online or correspondence chess where books and other references are allowed. However, white deviates with a different line, preparing to castle kingside earlier than would be possible after 3. Nc3.} Bb7 4. Be3 {I give myself 3 question marks for this idiotic move, even if it only deserves one. Here's how it happened. I'm juggling 25 games or so, I've never seen this opening, and I'm relying on the GK DB to guide me through the first moves so I don't screw them up while I spend much more time on a dozen other games that are all demanding moves. The DB said 4. Bd3. I looked in the DB, came back to the game and played 4. Be3?. I don't know why. I guess too much hurry and not enough attention, and zero analysis of what the move actually looked like. So yeah, white loses a pawn here, for nothing. Because I'm an idiot.} Bxe4 5. Nbd2 {Damage is done, it's time for damage control. Develop with a tempo. Let's call 4. Be3! a subtle gambit. Very subtle.} Bb7 6. c4 Bb4 7. a3 Bxd2+ 8. Bxd2 {Black is cleverly exchanging pieces, heading toward that +pawn endgame he can win. White needs to make something happen before that eventuality comes to being.} d6 9. Bd3 {Developing. The lead in development plus the marginal lead in the center (would be much better with a pawn on e4, I suppose) is weak compensation for the pawn.} h6 10. O-O Nf6 11. Re1 O-O 12. Bc2 {Looking for trickiness. Can white win this with a swindle?} Nbd7 13. Bf4 Nh5 14. Qd3 {White's bishop in en prise, but so is black's king. This is way less subtle than white's gambit...} Ndf6 15. Bd2 c5 16. g4 {15. ...c5? was black's own subtle gambit, I think. One cannot help but note that black's knight on h5 has no safe moves. Note that the pawn is en prise at g4, but black cannot play 16. ... Nxb4??? which allows 17. Qh7#.} Bxf3 17. Qxf3 {Black trades, but his knight on h5 is still doomed, unless he wants to sac his other knight.} Nxg4 18. Qxg4 {17. ... Nxg4 is a scary choice for black. It positions the white pieces perfectly to kill the pawn on h6. Well, almost perfectly.} Nf6 19. Qg2 Nh5 20. Bd1 {19. ... Nh5? was another gambit. That knight would have been safer on e8. And the pawn on h6 would have been safer if it had at least one defender that isn't pinned to the black king. } Kh7 21. Bxh5 {20. ... Kh7? defends the pawn and staves off immediate checkmate, but I think a better try for black was 20. ... Nf6, 21. Bxh6 Ne8. That also staves off checkmate but doesn't lose a knight. Better still would have been 19. ... Ne8 leaving black two more moves to find some safety for the king and his pawns.} Qf6 22. dxc5 {Black's queen puts an end to white's party, for now. But there are other parties.} bxc5 23. Rad1 g5 24. Bc3 {It's decision time for black here. White is up a lot of material, having two bishops in exchange for only two pawns. Black should be cautious of any material exchanges. On the other hand, with a 4-2 kingside pawn advantage, especially with white's broken pawn structure, black could do a lot of damage without all the big pieces. But white has a hidden attack here, so black's best option is to draw the queen back to safety. Not so much safety for the queen, but for the black king.} Qf4 25. Rxe6 {Instead black jumps to the attack, threatening the undefended pawn at c4. A mistake. White sacrifices a rook to open up the black king's rambling castle. Best course here for black is to just take the rook, though that's very costly: 25. ... fxe6 26. Rxd6 Rf7 27. Bxf7 Qc1+ 28. Qf1 Qxf1+ 29. Kxf1 a5 30. Bxe6 leaves white ahead by two bishops and a pawn.} Rae8 26. Rf6 {White is now threatening checkmate. Black's best course of action is 26. ... Qxf6, sacrificing his queen.} Qxc4 27. Qb7 {Instead black took the easy pawn and now it's all over for black. 27. ... Qxc3 lets him live a few extra moves.} Kg8 28. Rdxd6 {After 27. ... Kg8, white entered the conditional moves to the various checkmates, starting with 28. Rdxd6. Incidentally, I think there were checkmates starting with 28. Rg6 too, but they seemed to be easier for black to stall (not prevent).} Re2 29. Rfg6+ {28. ... Re2 does nothing to save black, but he had nothing with which to save himself anyway. However, it wasn't part of the previously entered conditional moves, so white entered more conditional moves starting with 29. Rg6+, but black resigned before he played either legal move. If 29. ... fxg6, 30. Qg8#. If 29. ... Kh7, 30. Rxh6+ Kg8 31. Rh8#}
