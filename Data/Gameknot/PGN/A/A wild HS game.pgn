1. e4 {As always...} e5 {and as always...} 2. f4 {As usual...} d5 {I had spoken with chess queen Miss L. and she suggested I try this, for an "interesting" game. But she didn't tell me what to do AFTER this move.} 3. fxe5 {I figured one of my Pawns would be captured...} Bc5 {I've never done this before, but I figured development would be good...} 4. exd5 {There goes my other central Pawn...} Qh4+ {Any time I can get this in safely, that's always a good thing...} 5. Ke2 {Um... I was thinking that 5 P-N3 was better, but I wasn't going to say anything out loud.} Qe4# {Well, that's the game... it was indeed interesting...}
