1. Nf3 c5 2. e4 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O Rb8 {The 'Chinese' Dragon. Black will play directly along the b-file, aiming to open up the b-file for his a8 rook as soon as possible via ..b5 (often as a sacrifice). For more information on this variation, the reader can check out some of my past annotations. } 11. g4 {As I've noted before, this move is simply a mistake! White weakens the f3 pawn prematurely, allowing Black to play ..b5 followed by ..Ne5 and the threat of .. Nxf3 causes White tremendous problems. } b5 12. Ndxb5 Ne5 13. Be2 Bxb5 14. Nxb5 Nxf3 {The point. White cannot defend the b5 knight and the f3 pawn at once. Now Black regains material with a strong attack. } 15. Bxf3 Rxb5 16. h4 {Uh oh. White overlooks the threat to b2 (again with this square!) that arises after the f6 knight moves (threatening forced mate in several moves after .. Bxb2 ). This is a typical Dragon motif (it often occurs after an Exchange sacrifice along the c-file too), where the knight attacks the queen and reveals an even deadlier attack on b2. White is dead lost. } Nxe4 17. Bxe4 {}
