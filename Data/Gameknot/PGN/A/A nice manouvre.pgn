[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {A wild, wild game with horrible moves by both sides... but funny, I think. } c6 2. Bf4 g6 3. c3 Bg7 4. e4 b5 {An interesting option for black is this quick attack. But it is advisable to have the bishop on the f8 square...} 5. g3 {Trying a different approach to the opening, not usual for me. The idea is to take advantage of the diagonal, but is a double edged fight that probably would have costed me the game in an expert's hand. } d6 {Black favours my plan by weakening c6. On the other side, if he wants to untangle his pieces he should be fighting to be safely able to play c5. } 6. a4 {I should have stuck to my plan, with Bg2, but...} a6 7. a5 {axb5 was better, but note that I am not still able to secure my dominion of the white diag. So I made a solid outpost for a piece in b6...} Nf6 8. Bg2 O-O 9. Nd2 {Black is unsure about how to develop. } Re8 {But now he has a plan: e5. } 10. e5 {So I prevent it by playing myself to e5. I have the power to to this. } Nd5 11. Bxd5 {I sacrifice the good bishop, but the diag will be closed to his bishop, too. Black's worst enemy is his own e7 pawn. } cxd5 12. Qf3 dxe5 13. Be3 {I prefer to exchange here and keep the diagonal closed. My king has to castle, and I want it kingside. So it is not wise to overopen the game. } exd4 14. Bxd4 e5 {Good by black. Now I am in little trouble. Fortunately (would you have said that?) my outpost is excellent...} 15. Bb6 e4 16. Qe3 {Simply. This turned out to be more complicated for me than foreseen, due to my unwise moves. } Qd6 17. Bc5 Qc6 18. Ne2 {A scaring position. } Nd7 19. Nd4 {My secret weapon. } Bxd4 20. Bxd4 {Solid as a rock! And with a mate threat almost done! Et voil√†!} Re6 {Black sees it. } 21. Qh6 {Anyway. } Nf6 22. O-O {I adore castling when it is an attacking move, but probably g5 would have been more accurate. } Qe8 23. f4 Qf8 24. Qh4 {I can cash some edge by exchanging queens due to f5. But it is far too low a prize for me. } h5 {Blacks doesn't see the danger. I can take the knight, but it was nicer...} 25. f5 Rd6 26. Bxf6 Bxf5 27. Rxf5 gxf5 28. Qg5+ Kh7 29. Qxf5+ Kh6 30. g4 Qg8 {Here I blundered, since Qxh5 was mate. But I had already seen the following: } 31. g5+ Qxg5+ 32. Qxg5+ Kh7 33. Qg7# {And that's all... }
