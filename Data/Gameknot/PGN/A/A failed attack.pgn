[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {This is a game I played at my chess club in the internal tournament. Unfortunately I lost, but there was an interesting selection of attacks and tactics.} Nf6 2. Bf4 {Unusual, but solid.} d5 {Attempting to close up the centre.} 3. e3 Bf5 4. c4 e6 {Both players are aiming to control the centre.} 5. Qb3 {Both players are aiming for central pressure.} b6 6. Nc3 Nc6 {This is a mistake, although black turns out not to be terribly affected.} 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bb5 {Black must be very creful about 9.Qa4.} Bd7 9. Nxd5 {White wins a pawn, but must sidestep a tactical trap.} Nxd5 10. Qxd5 Bb4+ {Now if 11.Ke2?? or Kd1??, 11...Bg4+ wins the queen, and white is permanently prevented from castling.} 11. Kf1 Nb8 {While white can win the exchange here, he reaches a difficult position, in which black has dangerous counterplay.} 12. Bxd7+ Nxd7 13. Rc1 {Again, there is the threat of material loss for black; however, he judges the benefits to outwiegh the pawn.} O-O 14. Rxc7 Nf6 15. Qxd8 Rfxd8 {White has two extra pawns, but black has a short-term advantage in view of his superior development. While the rook on the 7th rank is effective, for a rookon the 7th it is relatively weak, due to the ease with which its targets can be removed and itself kicked away.} 16. a3 Bxa3 {An unusual sacrifice, but since black will be dragged down by attrition if he allows white to complete his development without gaining new advantages, he might as well sacrifice a bishop unlikely to be of major use.} 17. bxa3 Nd5 {White has a considerable material advantage, but his peices are misplaced; the game will depend on how well he can recover his position.} 18. Rc4 b5 19. Rc5 Nxf4 {If the knight is taken, the rooks become higly dangerous due to the open d and e files, but I beleive nonetheless that taking was his best option here.} 20. Rxb5 Nd5 {The queenside has been opened up, allowing the black rooks into the attack.} 21. Nf3 Rac8 {Black has potential to take control of white's 1st rank - If the king goes to e2, then Nc3+.} 22. g3 {This is a very goodmove, since it allows white to bring his king (eventually) to safety, giving him a solid advantage.} Rc2 {Preventing the king from escaping to g2 due to ...Nxe3+, and allowing doubling of the rooks.} 23. Ra5 Nc3 {Planning to attack f2.} 24. Kg2 Nd5 {With the aforementioned threat to e3.} 25. Re1 Nf6 {Again going for f2.} 26. Rxa7 {Three pawns now.} Ng4 {However, black will recover at least one, since there is no way to preserve f2: 27.Rf1? Nxe3+ wins the exchange.} 27. Ne5 {Perhaps the only move in the position. This allows a white counterattack, albeit not a very potent one.} Nxf2 28. Kf1 Ne4 {28...Nh3 ends in retreat to g5 after 29.Re2} 29. Re2 Rc1+ 30. Kg2 {It may be worth mentioning that my opponent was running short of time, but would gain an extra 15 minutes at move 35; thus, neither of us was thinking much at this point, asI wanted to deny white the chance to think during my time.} Nc3 31. Rb2 Nd1 32. Rb3 f6 {This not only drives away the knight, but also prevents back-rank mate, allowing the second rook in.} 33. Nd3 Rc2+ 34. Kf3 Re8 {At this point, black has an excellent position in terms of his peices working together, but I cannot see any actual mating attack, or any way of recovering more than a pawn.} 35. e4 Nc3 36. Rc7 {I hadn't anticipated this, and spent some time trying to find a defence.} f5 {In hindsight, this was probably what cost me the game: it acheives nothing positive following the response, and gives white a passed pawn. It was made out of desperation, before I found my next move.} 37. e5 Nb5 {An excellent move! If only I had seen it the previous move! This wins a pawn, and isolates the e-pawn - had I played 36...Nb5!, I suspect that I would have at least drawn. Unfortunately, this was too late, although it was pleasing to surprise both my opponent and an observer who had moved away, thinking that was the knight "trapped" I was lost. Of course, I lost anyway.} 38. Rxc2 Nxd4+ 39. Kf4 Nxb3 {Perhaps 39...Nxc2 would have been better, perhaps not. I tink it probably was, but there isn't much in itThe f5 pawn is protected by the threatr of ...Nd4+.} 40. Rc3 Nd4 41. Rc4 Rd8 {The position was starting to run out of the tactics that had held me through the late opening, middlegame and early endgame.} 42. Ke3 Ne6 43. Nf4 {There did not seem to be any realistic alternative to exchanging, unfortunately.} Nxf4 44. Kxf4 g6 45. h4 Rd7 {I planned to bring my king to e6 and play for a draw. Unfortunately there were still tactics, and in my opponent's favour.} 46. e6 Ra7 47. a4 Kf8 48. Rd4 {Now, I could not allow the rooks to be exchanged off, whatever the gain, due to the a-pawn providing a decoy for my king. This prevented ...Ke7, and gave the threat of 49.Rd8+ and 50.Rd7+.} Ke8 49. Kg5 {And so the white king became unstoppable.} Ra6 {To prevent Kh6.} 50. Kf6 Ra7 51. Rb4 {Threatening mate.} Ra8 52. Rb7 Kf8 53. Rxh7 {Again threatening mate.} Kg8 54. Rd7 {And the e-pawn is insanely powerful.} Rxa4 {Removing this to do at least what I could.} 55. Rd8+ Kh7 {At this point I lose track of exactly what happened, but it's clear that white will win (though still up only a pawn) and win he did.}
