[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bd3 e6 4. Nd2 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. f4 {This game was part of a stonewall themed mini-tournament, and this is the opening position.} Bd6 7. Ngf3 Bd7 8. Ne5 O-O {Both sides develop their pieces.} 9. g4 {! White goes for the jugular, and immediately storms my kingside. } cxd4 10. exd4 {Pawn exchange. White recaptures with his e pawn, and does not allow me to play Nb4.} Be8 {I maneuver my bishop to cover my kingside and to allow my knight to land on d7, which would further contest White's e5 outpost.} 11. O-O Qb6 {I pin the pawn on d4, "removing" a defender of the knight. I also put some pressure on b7.} 12. Ndf3 {White covers both his knight on e5 and his pawn on d4. The knight is ready to hop on g5 as well.} Nd7 {I threaten the knight once more.} 13. Bxh7+ {!? White sacrifices his bishop to burst open my kingside before I play g6. All hell is going to break loose at this point. The position can ce defended, but the right sequence of moves is quite hard to find. A great move for the sake of playing chess!} Kxh7 {Not taking would be silly.} 14. Ng5+ Kg8 15. Nxd7 {! White decides to remove my knight on d7 so that Nf6 would not be an option.} Bxd7 16. Qd3 {! My opponent threatens mate on h7, and prepares to place his queen on h3!} g6 {The best move. 16.f5 is a possibility, but it busts my kingside wide open, and I did not want that to happen.} 17. Qh3 {Obviously. Mate is once again threatened on h7. How can I prevent mate? Can I defend that square? No. Can I take out one of the attacking pieces? No. Can I block the line of attack? No. Can I make some breathing room for my king? Not really. (17...Rfc8 18.Qh7+ Kf8 19.Qxf7#) Can I check my opponent's king? I can (17...Qxd4+), but it achieves nothing and I simply lose my queen. Can I move my king away?} Kg7 {I can, and I must. Surprisingly enough, I can safely access the f6 square, which is in front on my pawn barricade.} 18. Qh7+ Kf6 19. f5 {! White opens up files for his rook and bishop.} exf5 {I must try to blunt White's attack, so I capture the pawn. If I can survive the assault without losing heavy materials, then I could win!} 20. Qh4 {! Very strong. I'm not sure if I can allow the discovered check to happen.} Kg7 {I did not take any risk, and I moved away. White can check me on h7, but then I would go back to f6.} 21. Nh7 {!! Very dangerous; White attacks my rook and threatens mate (once again) via 22.Qh6+ Kg8 23.Nf6#. } Be7 {? and ! Even though this is technically the losing move (the comuter suggests 21...f4, which I missed), it does set up a number of traps to fall in. 22.g5 would be met by 22...Rh8, for example.} 22. Qh6+ {White checks me and put his queen out of danger.} Kg8 {Forced. (22...Kh8?? 23.Nf6#)} 23. Bg5 {! The best move. I was hoping for 23.Re1, threatening to remove the defender of f6, which I would have responded with 23...Nxd4!, threatening a double check and swapping off some material. If white then blocks the diagonal with 24.Be3, then I play g5!!, attacking White's queen from across the board. } f6 {I cannot take the bishop due to 25.Nxg5, with an unavoidable mate next turn or two. 24...Qd8 is not an option either, because of 25.Rae1 (attacking my dark-square bishop) Be6 (blocking the e file) 26.gxf5! is devastating. Therefore, I am forced to lose material, and the only sensible thing I can do is to complicate the position.} 24. Qxg6+ {Obviously.} Kh8 25. Nxf8 {White trades off his remaining knight for my rook and opens up the h file.} Rxf8 {I take the knight. (25...Bxf8?? 26.Bxf6#)} 26. Rf3 {! Very good. There is only one way to stop 27.Rh3#.} fxg4 {The downside of this move is that it allows white to take down my f pawn.} 27. Bxf6+ Bxf6 28. Rxf6 {Bishop trade. } Rxf6 {Forced, even though I lose no matter what I do. I could not have played 28.Qd8 here due to 29.Qh6+ Kg8 30.Qg5+ Kh7 31.Rh6#.} 29. Qxf6+ Kh7 {29...Kg8 leads to mate, because of 30.Qg6+ Kh8 (30...Kf8 31.Rf1+ Ke7 (31...Bf5 32.Rxf5+ Ke7 33.Rf7+ Kd8 34.Qg8#) 32.Qf7+ Ke8 33.Qf8#) 31.Rf1 Qd8 32.Rf7 1-0} 30. Qf7+ {Check, with a fork. It doesn't really matter though.} Kh6 31. Rf1 {If white had taken my bishop, then I would have played 31...Nxd4, hoping that my opponent recaptures so I can get a perpetual check, but that didn't happen.  I waived the withe flag at this point, seeing that I could not efficiently stop 32.Rf6+. My thanks to stalhandske for this great game! 1-0}
