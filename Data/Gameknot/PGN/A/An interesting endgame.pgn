[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian, a personal favorite of mine.} 2. d3 {Not an idea I'm familiar with. More practiced with d4 or Nf3 lines. I decide to continue with natural development.} Nc6 3. Nc3 d6 4. Nf3 Bd7 5. a3 Nf6 6. b4 {?! An interesting move from my opponent. I was expecting an eventual d4 after the development of whites bishops to the center; this contests c4 and frees the long diagonal for his bishop.} g6 {I decide to do nothing about the pawn and focus on the diagonal, as well as getting my king out of trouble.} 7. bxc5 dxc5 8. Bf4 {Another good natural move from my opponent, though from my earlier comment, unexpected.} Bg7 {Taking the diagonal that was so willingly conceded, and putting pressure on the unsupported knight.} 9. Nb5 {?? Bad idea.} Qa5+ 10. c3 {Bd2 and Qd2 all amount to the same thing. The knight is lost.} Qxb5 11. Rb1 Qa6 {? In hindsight, I think Qa5 may have been slightly better. There are a lot of variations that give white decent attacking chances here, I opted to be cautious. Thoughts?} 12. Bc7 {Not a bad idea from white, trying to suffocate my queen is what I think the goal was here.} O-O {Getting my King to safety goes without saying.} 13. e5 {? Another questionable move. I was expecting (again) d4, which would a) develop the light squared bishop, b) attack my queen and further tighten the noose on it, c) attack my weak c4 pawn, and d) prepare for this on whites next move. Instead...} Nd5 {I now have a counter-attack. White can choose between a fork or his bishop next move.} 14. d4 {Temporary relief, if it can be called that.} Qxa3 15. e6 {Not sure what the purpose of this was. I decide to ignore it for now, and go for the jugular.} Qxc3+ {Forcing white to deal with my threats before I come back to his. Tactical complications abound.} 16. Nd2 Bxe6 {? A bad idea from me, I missed...} 17. Rb3 {! A trap of my Queen, threatening not just a capture but an even game (material wise, at least. I'm sure better players than myself will make points about minor pieces being better than a Queen or Rook by itself. This is a nuance of the game I didn't know at the time and I admit I still don't fully comprehend or appreciate). I spent a lot of time here (yes, I see that I can capture the pawn but I don't want to give up tempo).} Qxb3 {Abandoning the attach and snatching material. I still have the bishop on c7 and pawn on d4 for compensation. Not the best move in hindsight, but we wouldn't have the strange game that follows either.} 18. Nxb3 Nxc7 {Expected exchanges.} 19. Nxc5 Nd5 {Not sure what I was thinking here. Rab8 would probably have been better.} 20. Bc4 Rac8 21. Bxd5 {Still leaving the pawn on b7 untouched. ? } Bxd5 22. O-O {At long last. Now things get interesting, since we have a wide open center where it is effectively going to be a fight of 2 bishops and a rook vs a queen.} Nxd4 {Been wanting to do that. } 23. Nd3 {!? Looks to be the right move from my opponent, but I felt something was abound.} e5 24. Re1 Rfe8 {Strengthening my space and center advantage.} 25. Nb4 Bb3 26. Qd3 Bc4 {Harassing the quen as I look for an opening to attack from.} 27. Qe4 b5 {Not fearing the threat to e5, I bolster my queenside.} 28. Na6 {Looks suspect. Any thoughts? My oppenent had been playing the position fairly well to this point.} Rcb8 {?? Missed Rf6. And took my Rook off an open file. And blundered.} 29. Nxb8 Rxb8 30. f4 {Now white has the resources to attack e5. Can't allow that.} f5 31. Qe3 e4 {Locking the queen out of my claim. My pieces have great cohesion and synergy. White has little going for him.} 32. Qa3 {Looking for a way in and an attack.} Ra8 {Denied. a6 will seal the deal. } 33. Qa6 {Or not entirely. Fortunately, whites queen can really only harass.} Ne2+ {The game will be played on my terms.} 34. Kh1 Nxf4 35. Qb7 {Expected.} Rd8 {Conceding the pawn and taking open file. Back-rank mating threats should keep his rook in place.} 36. Ra1 {?? Or not.} Bxa1 37. h3 {Last hope.} Rd1+ {Would Be5 first have been better?} 38. Kh2 Bd4 39. Qc8+ {I can survive the checks. White is done.} Kg7 40. Qd7+ Bf7 {In good fashion, I can't end a game without making one more questionsable decision. I was too fearful of my king getting put on the ropes and cornered by whites pawns.} 41. Qxb5 Bg1+ {And it's over.} 42. Kg3 Nh5+ 43. Kh4 Bf2+ 44. Kg5 h6# {All in all, an interesting game. Neither of us played brilliantly, but then again, we wouldn't have had the interesting endgame either. Hope you all enjoyed.}
