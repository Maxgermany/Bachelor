1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is another game in Concordborn's Sicilian Pelikan MT.  It has a lot of twists and turns to it and both sides made big blunders.  These blunders thankfully proved not to be fatal for either side, although it did result in me conceding a low draw in the endgame.  At least my opponent is a fellow Class A player, and if a load of Experts and Masters had not timed out on me, Tamas and I would have had similar ratings.  So, how did this latest drama unfold?  Well, to follow this game, the Gameknot Analysis link is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17836218&rnd=0.45445301136640437} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 {6. ...... d6 - the first six moves were the standard move set up by our MT.} 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 {8. Na3 - these moves are not part of the standard set up but they are book moves, in fact, the first 23 moves will follow the Book!} b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 {9. ....... gxf6 - rather than move my knights out of the way of the fork on b4 I opt to shatter black's kingside with a B for N exchange - can't resist this, can I, Ion!} 10. Nd5 {10. Nd5 - outpost and a hone-in on f6.} f5 11. Bd3 Be6 12. O-O {12. 0-0 - after clearing the way for castling, Henry is tucked away on the kingside.  You would never think that he would be vulnerable to a potential back-ranker later on, would you?} Bxd5 13. exd5 Ne7 14. c3 Bg7 {14. ...... Bg7 - if NxP then BxP.} 15. Qh5 {15. Qh5 - Whoohoo, woohoo, out comes Glenda on her broomstick to h5.  She is putting f7 and h7 under her beady eye and the pawn on f5 is now doubly attacked.  Tamas screens off this attack with e4 next turn.} e4 16. Bc2 O-O {16. ...... 0-0 - Tamas now tucks his king away, can I launch a mating attack on his castled king?  It may take a long job with the centre fixed with black pawns but maybe a rook lift from a1-e1 - h3 or g3 could be an idea.  I execute it later on, only to be bogged down by Old Matey patrolling my back row.} 17. Rae1 Qc8 18. Kh1 {18. Kh1 - book move, but maybe I should have carried out my idea of Re3 - g3 and putting black's dsb under fire from the rook and Glenda.} Rb8 19. f3 {19. f3 - an attempt to smash that screen.} b4 20. fxe4 {20. fxe4 - it looks as though I have blundered a piece, but as you will see, this is still book and I will get the material back.} bxa3 21. exf5 Rxb2 22. f6 {22. f6 - pawn fork.  Black also finds himself in Old Matey's shadow (Qxh7#).  Our chessic Grim Reaper is gonna be a very busy man from here on in.} Ng6 23. fxg7 Kxg7 24. Bd3 {24. Bd3 - Fou Leblanc evades black castle fire by shifting to e3.} Qxc3 25. Re3 Qd2 26. Qf3 Rxa2 27. Bxg6 {27. Bxg6?? - OMG - I should have played Rf2 skewering the Witch and the rook on a2.  The only thing was, and this is something to beware of, especially when you are playing a lot of games with problematical moves to think about, it can be sooo easy to switch off from a game where your opponent takes a few days to make a move.  When you come back to the board, even though you may have calculated the correct move, it can be easy to go wrong.  Lesson 2 - if you do put it in your notes, check your notes every time you are about to make your move.  It may prevent you from making Yours Truly's mistake.} hxg6 28. Qf6+ {28. Qf6+ - nothing for it but to go for all out attack and hope that it will lead to mate for black.} Kg8 29. Rg3 {29. Rg3 - continuing in the attempt to redeem myself.  The threat here is Rxg6+ as the f7 pawn is pinned to the rook on f8 and my rook on f1 can then join in the attack on the denuded BK after Glenda removes the rook on f8 with check.  I would have liked to have played Rh3 here (threatening Rh8#), but after seeing a grinning Old Matey point his skeletal like finger towards g2 that move is out of the question, sigh and double sigh!} Qc2 30. Qxd6 {30. Qxd6 - might as well reduce my material deficit to only one point which should have been a lead of 3 points.} Rb2 31. Qxa3 {31. Qxa3 - reducing it to zero - again, should have been plus 4.} Rb1 32. Qxa6 {32. Qxa6 - Glenda removes the final passer on the queenside.  I am now up in material and at least I have a potential Glenda 2 on the d column.  But will that potential be realised?  We shall see.  Note that that capture on a6 was only possible because Glenda (known as Glenda the Defender), poor put upon lady, defends the rook on f1.} Rfb8 33. Rgf3 {33. Rgf3 - I now pile on the f7 pawn and defend my f1 rook a second time.} Rb8b2 {33. ..... R8b2 - and again, Henry is in Old Matey's shadow.  There is only one way to save Henry ........} 34. Qa8+ {34. Qa8+ ....... CHEEEECK!  Now Glenda threatens mate in 3 due to a white rook swinger onto h3 and Glenda landing on h8.  But black also finds the only way out ....} Rb2b8 {34. ...... Rb8 - block.} 35. Qc6 {35. Qx6 - offering a queen trade of which black declines.} Rxf1+ 36. Rxf1 {36. Rxf1 - rook trade.} Qe2 37. Qf6 {37. Qf6 - renewing the pile on (and protecting the rook on f1 and at the same time staving off Old Matey on the back row).  That pawn on f7 has been menaced for some time.  It will survive, however, and this pawn will be instrumental in me conceding that low draw!} Rb7 38. Ra1 {38. Ra1 - another mate threat, this time on black's back row!} Rb8 39. d6 {39. d6 - only two steps away from Glendadom.} Re8 40. h3 {40. h3 - at long last I make some luft for Henry.} Qe6 41. Qxe6 fxe6 {41. ...... fxe6 - when a pawn up it is normally a good idea to trade queens.  Not sure here.} 42. d7 {42. d7?? - this miscalculation seals my fate.  If Henry had been on the third rank I might have had the tempi to swipe black's pawns and crown my own.  But Henry is still on the first rank and in the endgame that is bad.} Rd8 43. Rd1 Kf7 44. Kh2 {44. Kh2 - my finger has been hovering over the Offer Draw button for the last day or so.  But I advance Henry in hope of a slip up along the way.} Ke7 45. Kg3 Rxd7 46. Rxd7+ Kxd7 47. Kf4 {47. Kf4 - As I now know the position is drawn and my opponent is now visiting the board daily I now decided to bite the bullet.  I now plumb in some conditional moves and at the end of the conditional moves my opponent offered me a draw.  I accepted because I knew it would result in me and Tamas having just our bare kings.  On the minus side, I should have won this game hands down and gained 7 rating points instead of losing 3.  If I am to reach Expertdom, of which I was only 44 points away from, this game shows that there is much room for improvement for Yours Truly.  On the plus side, no doubt it has had you, the Inquest Jury, sitting on the edge of your seats in the latter part of this game.  Anyhow, I hope you have all had a good read and are enjoying your weekend.  I now need to beat Tamas in my return game against him to get first place in the MT.  I just hope I have the focus and concentration to do it.} Ke7 48. Ke5 Kf7 49. h4 Ke7 50. g4 Kf7 51. h5 gxh5 {}
