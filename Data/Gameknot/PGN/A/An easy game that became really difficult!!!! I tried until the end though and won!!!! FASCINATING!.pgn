1. e4 {Hello everybody...This is a game that i played with a mate from Australia!!! This was our third game and i won the previous two... Well his rating is around 950 and mine is around 1420...But a huge mistake of mine showed that he's gonna win... Well i started with e4.} e5 {He played e5..} 2. Nf3 {Opening my knight.} b6 {Well he played b6 which was quite worthless i think.} 3. Nxe5 {So i took his e5 pawn.} f6 {f6 was not the greatest defence..} 4. Nf3 {So i put it  back.} Nh6 {He opened his knight in a awkard square instead of doing something different to develop his pieces in better squares.} 5. Bc4 {I played typical with my bishop..} c6 {c6 he played. I think Bc5 would be better...} 6. d4 {So i tried to take the space in the centre..} Ba6 {He wanted to exchange our bishops...} 7. Bxa6 {So i took it...} Nxa6 {And he took mine..Still he's quite back in development.} 8. Nc3 {I opened the other knight as well.} f5 {f5 is quite risky i think. } 9. e5 {But i replied with e5 instead of taking the pawn.} Bb4 {Now he's pushing my knight.} 10. Bg5 {And i pushing his queen..} Qc7 {Protection..} 11. Qd3 {i was opening my Queen for some more pressure. Now i wonder if 0-0 would be better..} Bxc3+ {He took the knight..} 12. bxc3 {I prefer to take it with my pawn instead of taking it with my Queen in order to take his knight somehow..haha} b5 {b5 stopped me doing it.} 13. c4 {I challenged his pawn.} Nb4 {And he played his knight nicely.. Now i've made a really bad bad movement...I didn't think so much so i was completely trapped!!!} 14. Qa3 {Qa3?? So bad for me...I still wonder how i managed to do that!} Nxc2+ {Nxc2+!!.. Great, so good! I felt so desperate and loser! Nothing to do!!!} 15. Kd2 {I just played with king though everything seemed tragic!} Nxa3 {Well done mate!!! The only thing that i had in mind was attacking somehow!!! I had to play aggresive though i knew i was lost!} 16. Rae1 {So i had a plan or somekind of plan to attack to his king! But he could easily defend i suppose!} Qa5+ {Now he's checking!} 17. Kd1 {I simlpy defended!} bxc4 {And he took the pawn in order to push me more later!} 18. e6 {i played e6!} c3 {He pushed his pawn further! i think 0-0 would be better for him!} 19. exd7+ {Check..He can't roocke now.} Kxd7 {He took the pawn! Now i wanted checked him continiously in order to win something!} 20. Re7+ {Again check. i wanted the second roock out as well!} Kd6 {He replied badly for me! Better would be Kc8 i think.} 21. Rhe1 {The second rook is coming out!} c2+ {Logical!} 22. Kc1 {Nothing more to do.} Rab8 {Nice movement that he didn't actually take advantage of.} 23. Re1e6+ {Now my plan was starting to become reality though i still had a lot to do! So check!} Kd5 {Nowhere else to go!} 24. Re6e5+ {Again check. Nice movement i think!} Kc4 {He just replied.. Now i somehow had the chance to equalize...Still he could win the game easily and i could lost 19.5 points!!!! Oh God!! haha} 25. Rxa5 {Somehow my plan became truth! But the game was at his hands!} Kc3 {I think with that movement lost the game!!! i mean Rb1 would be a thousand times better!!! And also i still don't why he hasn't protected his knight!!! Until that moment he had the control of this game but now i won't let him win!} 26. Rxa3+ {Of course i take advantage of his previous mistake!} Kc4 {And still he should have replied better. I mean K b3 would be better. Now he killed his game and destroyed everything as his pawn was lost..} 27. Kxc2 {took the pawn!!} Rb4 {He might try a rook compination.} 28. Rc3+ {I checked him again...I felt so relieved that i change the game upside down. With some blunders black lost an easy winning game and 19.5 points.} Kb5 29. Rc5+ {I was trying to checkmated him though it would take sometime!} Kb6 {He patheticly replied.. } 30. Kc3 {I approached his rook!} a5 {a5 for protection! now i need the compination of all my pieces in order to win!} 31. Re6 {c6 pawn was a target.} Rc8 {He's protecting it!} 32. Ne5 {I played the knight as a wanted my bishop in the f3 square.} Ng8 {He played his knight too.} 33. Be3 {i put it here in order to protect the rook after d5. Actually that move never happened.} Nf6 {He played his knight and made me change me plans.} 34. Nc4+ {I checked!} Ka6 {I don't know if he played it good. i think it's a bad movement.} 35. Rxa5+ {Another check!} Kb7 {He played Kb7. Now i h} 36. Kxb4 {He was forced away of his rook.So he lost it!!} Ng4 {He's lost i suppose...Nothing great to do!} 37. Re7+ {I check once more!} Rc7 {He defended with the rook!} 38. Nd6+ {Another check with the knight!!} Kb6 {He played his king! } 39. d5+ {Smart check!!!} c5+ {Now he checked me!!!} 40. Bxc5+ {I took the pawn and checked again!} Rxc5 {He took my useful bishop.} 41. Rxc5 {Bye bye rook!} f4 {Nothing more to do!} 42. Rb7+ {Check...} Ka6 {Nowhere to go!} 43.
