1. e4 e6 2. d4 {Since his first move didn't challenge the center, I pushed ahead to continue gaining a strong center. } d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bd2 dxe4 5. Nxe4 {After Knight takes e4 I expect him to exchange dark square bishops, but instead... } Qxd4 {Wins the hanging pawn but exposes Black's queen with only one minor piece developed. } 6. Bd3 {I develop my Bishop, and avoid a potential Queen trade in the near future. } Bxd2+ 7. Qxd2 Qxb2 {Black takes the unprotected b2 pawn.  Honestly I missed that move, but I like my overall position here much better than Black's, and I want to take advantage of his over-extended queen and lack of development. } 8. Qd1 {Protecting both the rook and c2 pawn. } Ne7 9. Nf3 Qb4+ 10. c3 {The c3 push is protected by the knight on e4, and I'm preparing to castle kingside. } Qa5 {A passive move on Black's part, and giving the queen little to do since once I castle kingside she won't be threatening my king any longer. } 11. O-O O-O 12. Nfg5 {I mount my attack on Black's king.  My knight on g5 is protected by my knight on e4. } Nbc6 {He finally decides to continue developing, but a little too late. } 13. Qh5 {I'm threatening queen takes h7 mate. } h6 {An defensive move to the queen takes h7 threat.  However, now the h7 square is opened up, and my bishop on d3 has a bead on it... } 14. Nf6+ {Continuing the attack and breaking open his kingside defense. } gxf6 15. Qxh6 {Both the bishop on d3 and the knight on g5 protect the h7 square for queen to h7 checkmate.  He can't deal with both in one move... } Ne5 16. Qh7# {I gave up a bishop, knight, and three pawns and he only lost a bishop and two pawns.  But I was able to develop more pieces and have a strong jump in tempo. }
