[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Torre attack"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. a3 c5 4. dxc5 Bxc5 {The exchange is in my favour. Black is slightly ahead in developement, and has both his central pawns. On the counterside, it is delicate for me to develop the lsb. } 5. c4 {Contesting d5, correctly. } Qb6 {Making a naive threat on f2, more with the intention to control the game than to actually threat something. } 6. e3 {At least, this keeps white's dsb closed into his pawns. So maybe Qb6 was not so bad move, after all... :-)} Nc6 {It was time to go d5, but I felt somewhat unsure about it, and played this "it can't be bad" move. They normally happen to be bad, actually, but you can't say why. } 7. Nc3 {Ah, that's it. Because it doesn't take into account Na5. Now I must act as if I had a plan, after all. Let's see. } Qa5 {Of course, not b4, Nxb4, since the rook is hanging. } 8. Bd2 {Now, my "plan" was...} Bb6 {Planning to redeploy the queen to the kingside, but overlooking...} 9. Nd5 {This clever move (I should know it by heart, as a Scandinavian player... :-(} Qc5 {For the narrower margin, maybe I have a chance. } 10. Nxf6+ {Well, too bad. It can even play in my favour. } gxf6 11. Be2 {Very mildly. } d5 {Now it's my chance. I was forgien once, I won't be again. } 12. cxd5 Qxd5 {Not exd4, leaving my pawn damn weak for the endgame. My lsb will become free as these pawns will advance, and they sure will - oh yes they will...} 13. O-O {Come on, baby, just into my arms...} Rg8 14. Rc1 Qf5 {The idea is Qh3, provoking g3, and go on h5, h4. I know it is too slow, but I can't see anything better. Now, I would suggest Bc7 and Qh5, but this doesn't crush white. I'm down, and in serious danger to lose the game. } 15. Bc3 {Threats Qd6 (if it is a threat)} Bc7 {Aiming at h2, and controlling d6 against the white queen. } 16. Bd3 Qh3 {Scaring, but useless. } 17. g3 {Bxg3 is too risky. It's a blitz, but let's try to play it honorabily... } e5 {Blinding my dsb, but unfolding at last the dsb's power... will it be enough to balance the game? Anyway, white's not - too - energic play the moves before quickly reverted to my advangage. I still have the king in the center, but I can't help it. } 18. Re1 {White wants to play Bf1. I can't really avoid that. So...} Bg4 {Let's pin his knight. } 19. Bf1 Qh5 20. Bg2 {Ok, white could defend, an probably his position is stronger than before. I just managed to unravel a little my forces and create threats white has to care for... but not anymore. Furhtermore, I can't castle, and doubling the rooks on the g column won't help. f5, threatening e4, was countered by e4 by white. So I thought my only way to increase pressure was...} Rg6 {Aiming to h2 by Rh6.} 21. e4 {Well, this is not the best move now, since I can think about f5, and see what happens after f5 again. My king would be wide open, but my attack would be powered again. } Rh6 {But I had this in mind, so I went for it. Now, the threat BxN, followed by Qxh2+ is not deadly for white, but still I couldn't find the right way to proceed otherwise. } 22. Qd3 {Normal. But now I can chase it. } Rd8 23. Qe3 Bb6 24. Qe2 {Nice bind over white. I can't really break in, but he is tied. These are dangerous positions. What's the white's weak point? My knight in d4 would be wonderful, but how can I avoid the bishop to take it?} Bd4 {This way. I thought. } 25. Rcd1 {The move is now Ke7, avoiding the check after RxR. But I was too nervous, and wanted to press on. } Bxf3 26. Qxf3 Qxh2+ 27. Kf1 {Actually a mistake, as we shall see. } Ke7 {I hope for BxB, but my opponent is good. } 28. Ke2 {Now, I overlooked my trapped queen. A "simple" blunder. } Bxc3 {Useless, because now white recapture with the pawn and my knight can't go in. I'm lost because two careless moves. At least, this what I thought. } 29. Reh1 {Oh My, I realized now. I thought I have a faint chance my opponent gets lost in the following tactics. I didn't suspect that this move is a mistake by white and here black wins by force!} Qxh1 30. Rxh1 {If BxQ instead, Nd4+, RxN, BxR and I can't assess the position properly, but white, despite the queen, seems not very at his easy. The text move loses by force great material, but it is not really easy to see it all in a blitz. White is already losing, here, apparently.} Nd4+ 31. Kd3 Nxf3+ 32. Kxc3 Rxh1 33. Bxh1 Nd4 {And now it's just a matter of time. } 34. b4 Rc8+ 35. Kb2 Rc2+ 36. Kb1 Rxf2 {Here, white realizes that his lsb is lost, no there is no point in going on. But it was a fun and a wild game, I enjoyed it. }
