1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {A basic position for the Icelandic, having white played a slightly inferior choice with c4. } 5. Qb3 {...but white plays strong with this "novelty" (for my poor knowledge taken from my personal memory), and I must admit it caught me by surprise - as a novice. How to defend b7 without an ignominious retreat, or deprivating c6 from a pawn's support...} Qd4 {I "bet" something will work fine for me up there. Each weakness is exposed to the opponent's threat, normally at the cost of a valuable tempo that I can try to exploit on my own. Here, the Nf56's jump to e4 should bring me a strong attack on f2 in return - if needed - of the Ra8 (if a nearly mate threat is in sight). Of course, if white reacts with Nf3, Qe4+ protects b7 once for all. } 6. Qxb7 {Alea jacta est. How many tempoes do I need to become deadly? Just one. He needs two to become deadly (QxR, QxN).} Ne4 {After Qxf2+, QxBf1+ and following moves, black will find enough compensation for the R, and I will certainly find the way to get out of danger... if ever I needed it!} 7. Nh3 {Sacrifying the N?} Bxh3 {Maybe not the best, but Qxf2+ was too tempting. It "looked" the right one... which often misleads us, in chess!} 8. gxh3 Qxf2+ 9. Kd1 {Bf1 is not "en prise" anymore. Now black has to demostrate his manouver was not in vain.} Qf3+ 10. Kc2 {! White is defending the best way, I think. QxRh1 didn't work because of white's QxRa8, and black can't defend the Nb8, which is taken with check. I had to find something else! (Novice notice: in a timed game, you should have worked all this several moves ago, when playing Qd4 in the first place!:-)} Ng5 {?? I was resigned to exchange Q's and go on without much of an advantage, but I just overlooked the obvious white's...} 11. Bg2 {Ouch!!!! That's what happens when playing with fire. Now I knew that in any serious game I would be simply busted. But not on a rated blitz!} Qf5+ {Desperation. I am plainly busted!} 12. Kb3 {!? Interesting, instead of d3. Does it gives me some perspectives? Not really: Qd3+ just helps him to develop (Nc3). I can't save my R, and I have to parry Re1+... impossible!} Ne6 {Re1 is not a check anymore. Now, after QxRa8 (say), my N can enter the fry with some nasty jump to d4 or c5. An ugly idea, because I overlooked the WQ's check in c8. } 13. Bc6+ {...but my opponent was even more sadistic. Again: my only hope is to tempt him into grabbing material 1) without been mated in the process, 2) getting "someting" against his K, and 3) develop the Bf8 with tempo (hard) in order to castle and defend Nb8. I need a Terminator to do that! :-)} Nxc6 {?? The worst possible! } 14. Qxc6+ {I'll lose both pieces, and in addition my dsb will be blocked in! OMG!} Ke7 15. Qxa8 {So he lost a tempo but... at what cost? Let's see ;-)} Qd3+ 16. Nc3 Nd4+ 17. Ka4 Qxc4+ {The key of the combination! White is now busted... can you see the mate?} 18. b4 {?? but the alternative, Ka5, just called for Nc6+, which forces QxN, QxQ. So if you didn't see the mate, you was completely right! :-D} Qa6# {A pity my opponent lost the "last train" (Ka5), and I wonder if black had something better, or if his double-crazy sac can be considered as a sound sacrifice!}
