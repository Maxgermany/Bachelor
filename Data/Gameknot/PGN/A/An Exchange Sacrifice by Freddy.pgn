1. g3 {Hi everyone - sometimes things do have a habit of biting you on the behind!  Take this game.  Now, I am trying to rid myself of the disease Passivitis, but guess what?  In trying to do so, I invite the very thing that I am trying to avoid.  I try to set up my knight on what I think is a strong outpost only for Freddy to undermine its support by an exchange for pawn sacrifice and boy does it not just work in his favour!  I start off with 1. g3.  I remember the last time I played g3 against an Expert, who is now Master Heinzkat and see if I have learnt anything from it......} e5 2. Bg2 d5 3. d3 {3. d3 - preparing for an eventual e4.  I remember Master Heinzkat banging on about my failure to play e4.  I will play this move at the earliest available opportunity and hope I fare better this time!} g6 4. c3 Bg7 {4. ........ Bg7 - predictable follow-up to g6.} 5. Nf3 Ne7 6. O-O c5 {6. ...... c5 - impressive pawn centre!} 7. Nbd2 O-O 8. e4 {8.e4 - Master Heinzkat, I think you had better look at this!  I have played e4!} d4 9. cxd4 cxd4 10. b4 a6 11. a4 {11. a4 - attempt at dominance on the flank.} Nbc6 12. Ba3 b5 13. axb5 axb5 14. Nb3 Qd6 15. Nc5 {15. Nc5? - maybe Glenda should have gone to d2 - at least the pawn on b4 would have had some back up!} Rxa3 {15. ......... Rxa3!! - here comes the sacrifice!} 16. Rxa3 Nxb4 17. Qc1 {17. Qc1 - the knight on c5 must have some back up and unfortunately for me there is nobody else but Glenda.} Nec6 18. Rd1 Bf6 19. Ra1 {19. Ra1 - passivitis creaps in like some spreading fungus!} Be7 20. Nb3 f5 21. Ne1 fxe4 22. Bxe4 Nd5 23. Bxd5+ {23. Bxd5+ - I do not like this - with Freddy having a lsb and the Wicked Witch of the West that is certainly a cauldron of trouble for King Henry - but what was the alternative.  If I did not take the knight then surely it would hop on to c3 threatening my rook on d1.  If the rook then moved to d2 then it could quite easily be skewered by Bg5!  So, I hope that I will be able to defend my 2nd rank adequately agains the Wicked Witch.} Qxd5 24. Qb1 Bg4 25. Rd2 {25. Rd2 - dodges the line of one bishop, but .....} Bb4 {25....... Bb4 - walks into the line of another!} 26. Rc2 Bc3 27. Ra3 {27. Ra3 - having full control of the a file is deceptive.  Most of the squares are subject to tactics or are covered by Freddy's pieces - yikes!} Nb4 28. Rxc3 dxc3 {28. ........ dxc3 - there seemed nothing better than to return the exchange, my rook seemed to be a goner wherever he went.  Freddy had this to say in his post-match talk with me, however:-  " I would move 28. Nxd4 but looking at 25. Rd2 i think that one was prequel to the down-fall better should be 25. f3."} 29. Qc1 Nxd3 30. Nxd3 Qxd3 31. Na1 {31. Na1 - trying to nab the c pawn but maybe Glenda should have moved to f1 here but I did need to stop that c pawn from crowning.} Bh3 32. Rxc3 Qe4 33. f3 {33. f3 - Necessary to prevent Old Matey striking on g2.} Qe2 34. Rc2 {34. Rc2 - I think I have everything covered but .....} Qxf3 35. Qe1 Qf1+ {35. ........ Qf1+ - I thought I had it all covered but a fatal line up on the f file proves to be my downfall.  I get that horrid familiar sinking feeling.  I will be Freddied next move.} 36. Qxf1 Rxf1# {36. .......... Rxf1 CHECKMATE - Oh well, as the gameknot e-mail tells me I lost the game to easy19 - better luck next time! I can only hope so.}
