1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 {This is not a disaster, but in my view makes the game very easy for white, avoiding black's c5. } 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nbd2 {Other options are h3, e3, and, of course, c4. But this is just the move I want to avoid. This is not because it is bad, of course, but because it leads the game to too-well-known paths. } e6 {Without the black's lsb in f5, N or B b4 are not dangerous at all. } 5. e3 {I don't want to challenge the center right now. This is ok. If black Nh5, I'll invest a tempo in playing Bg3, and after the exchange, the semiopen column is in my favour. You can guess I am planning to castle - if ever - queenside. } Bd6 {Normal. } 6. Ne5 {Being the knight in f6, my knight can't be kicked quickly. Note that Nh5 is not possible now. } Bxe5 {Not the most recommendable capture. My knight was not too dangerous... still. } 7. dxe5 {This is always a surprise. } Ne4 {This is the natural square for the knight, and it seems very well placed, indeed... but...} 8. Qg4 {...this move causes some apprehension to black. Is not easy to defend g7. } Nxd2 {My opponent thought about forcing me to move my king. I'll show him that he just gave me a tempo, because my threats are more dangerous than the knight he took. } 9. Qxg7 Kd7 {I expected Rf8. I can, of course, go Qxf7+, exchange the queens, then I can take the knight and go on with a good game, but I wanted to get more. } 10. Bg5 {This was not a good move. Black has...} Qg8 {Better would have beeh Qf8 (with a glance to b4, just in case...). Anyway, white's attack is not as deadly as it seems. Now I am the one that has to find the right way to get out of this. } 11. Bf6 {He can save the knight, but will lose a rook. } Ne4 {The alternative was QxQ, BxQ, Rg8, B moves, KxN. Definitely better, since now black falls behind in material. } 12. Qxh8 {Black realizes that after exchanging the queens he will have few chances to draw, so goes for a counterattack. } Qg4 {The inmediate f3 causes white to win a piece, but I had a better idea. } 13. Bb5 {This can seem the classical overconfident's mistake... but it's not. The only move for black was NxBf6, exf6, and if Qxb2, Qf8. Black can eat both rooks, but will lose after Qe7#. } Qxg2 {He will remember this, methink...} 14. Qd8# {This is an unusual mate position, for sure...}
