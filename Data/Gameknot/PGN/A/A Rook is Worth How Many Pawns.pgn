[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf"]

1. e4 {This game was played in a Mini-Tournament with the first 5 moves prescribed: Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The real play starts from here.  This isn't Black's only option here, but it is a very popular one.  Its motivation is to play ...e5 without having to worry about a White piece landing on b5.} 6. Bd2 {[?!]  A very strange choice of move, that (as far as I know) has almost never seen the light of day in top flight chess.  The bishop is just too unhandily placed here, and will have to move again fairly shortly.  Any of the following moves are much more popular: 6.Be3; 6.Bg5; 6.Be2; 6.Bc4; 6.f4; 6.f3; 6.g3 and 6.h3.  The last of these, Weaver Adams's 'attack' was played by Bobby Fischer in 1962 against none other than Miguel Najdorf himself.  Fischer won.  Why was 6.Bd2 played here?  I suspect White wanted to avoid known lines.} e5 {The thematic thrust.  True, this leaves serious weaknesses at d5 and d6, but Black figures on active counterplay to distract White from exploiting them.} 7. Nb3 Be7 8. Be2 {White is playing conservatively, here, consistent with his 6th move.  This suggests a more the positional approach as presaged by the line 6.Be2, but this game doesn't quite turn out that way.} O-O 9. O-O Be6 {Black's development 'plays itself' - she stays with the straightforward.  Also possible (it seems to me) was 9...b5.} 10. f4 {Not until now does White make his aggressive intentions known.  This move is not intended to exchange on e5 nor yet f4, but to push on to f5, as the spearhead of a King side attack.} b5 {Black looks to the Q-side for counter action.} 11. Be3 {In effect White has ceded a tempo, but it probably hasn't cost him so very much.  This move opens the line of the Queen, and prevents ...Qb6ch  (if Black is contemplating such a move).} Qc7 {Getting the Q at once off the d-file to make way for a rook.  Why not develop the Queen's Knight here?  At the moment ...Nbd7 is not playable owing to the nasty response, f4-f5.  But Black has reason to believe that the knight will be required on that square to recapture on f6, after White brings his dark-square bishop to g5.  I am inclined to think, though, that ...Nc6, now or very shortly, would have been a playable option.} 12. f5 Bc8 {Heading for b7, and keeping the d7-square open for the knight.} 13. Nd5 {I infer from this move that White has no real interest in operations along the d-file, which used to be such a feature of positional treatments against the Najdorf.  After exchanges on d5, Black's weaknesses there will be masked, and practically unassailable.  That indicates White has other plans.} Nxd5 14. exd5 {Ordinarily one might prefer to play 14.Qxd5 to keep the file open for operations against d5 and d6.  But that tends to accelerate Black's development: 14.Qxd5?! Bb7  15.Qd3 ... (to protect e4 and c2) 15...Nd7, with ...Rfc8 to come.  So the pawn recapture has taken the preference.} Nd7 {Heading for f6, bearing in mind White is still probably interested in seeing what might be achieved on the K-side.} 15. Rc1 Nf6 {The obvious move, yet was there anything against 16...Nb6.  It would have prevented what White plays next (c2-c4) but allowed 17.Na5, eyeing c6.} 16. c4 {I'll be honest and state here I'm not altogether clear what the motivation for this is.  As will become clear, White's main focus is on the K-side, and this seems to be a distraction.  It does threaten to win a pawn by 17.cxb5, and the White bishops are effectively raking the Black Q-side right now.  } bxc4 17. Bxc4 {Threatening 18.Bxa6.  Black's situation looks unpleasant, but it is not clear yet that White has anything concrete...} a5 {Probably simplest: get out from under.  Also possible were 17...Bd7 (18.Bxa6 Qb8 or 18.Bb5 Qb7 19.Bxd7 Nxd7); and 17...Qb7 18.Na5 ... followed by 19...Nc6.  I can't say either of those options look very attractive for Black.} 18. Nd2 {Instead White could have begun K-side operations at once by 18.g4 a4 (say) 19.g5!? axb3  20.gxf6 Bxf6  21.Bxb3; or 19...Nd7 20.Nd2 Qb7 21.Ne4!? Qxb2 Rb1.  It is not clear that it would have led to anything better than the text does.} Qb7 {Attacks pawns at b2 and d5.  } 19. Qf3 {Keeps his much more important d-pawn.  When faced with losses in the centre and on the flank, and unable to defend both, to preserve the centre is usually to be preferred, as here.} Qxb2 {[!?] Might as well, leaving Black a pawn - the central passed pawn - to the good.  But looking ahead, one finds she will play ...h5 a couple of moves later.  Might it have been better played now, with the threat ...Ng4?  If White played (19...h5!?) 20.h3, then 20...Qxb2.  Moving the rook-pawn is weakening, sure, but it would have had the virtue of disrupting White's K-side plans.} 20. g4 {20.Bb3 looks an interesting alternative.} h6 {Making it more difficult to advance the White g-pawn.  Sometimes a voluntary weakening like this is better than having one forced upon you, but in general it is to be avoided until you have no choice.  Black did have an alternative, here: 20...Qa3 with the idea of committing the WQ to protecting the e3-bishop, or, if the latter moved, exchanging Queens.  If then 21.Bb3, a4; or 21.Nb1 Qb4.  But if, say, 21.Rfe1, then Black would probably have to play 21...h6 after all.} 21. h4 {Bringing up reinforcements.} h5 {[?!] The GKE (Gameknot engine) calls this an inaccuracy, suggesting instead 21...Qa3, with the idea 22.g5 hxg5  23.hxg5 Ng4!  Probably Black was hoping for 22.g5 Ng4.} 22. gxh5 {[!] Wins back the pawn and opens a line against the Black King.} Kh7 {[!?] Prepares to entrench g7 and h6.  Had Black to fear 23.h6 yet?  Say 22...a4 (to prevent Bb3) 23.h6!? g6!  24.fxg6 fxg4 25.Bg5 ... It is hard to see anything decisive for White here.  Black is under pressure, but for the moment at least appears to be holding her own.} 23. Kh1 {Clearing the g-file for one rook - if not both.  } Bd7 {Centralising - not a bad idea when faced with a flank attack.  But though ...Bb7 would certainly have been pointless now, 23...Ba6 must have been worth a look, forcing off the light square bishops.  true, that would have been Black's "good" bishop for White's "bad" one, but look at their respective functions.  Black's LSB wasn't doing very much; White's is helping maintain the vital d5-pawn.  So the exchange would have been a reasonable bargain from Black's point of view.} 24. Bd3 {[?!] Preparing Ne4.  But the Knight move could have been played at once, according to the GKE: 24.Ne4 Nxe4  25.Qxe4 Bf6  26.Rf2 Qa3  27.Rf3 Rab8 (say) 28.h6 gxh6  29.Bxh6, winning the exchange (Bishop attacks Rook, having 'discovered' the f3-Rook's attack against the Queen on a3).  What White has in mind are discovered attacks should ever the f6-square fall vacant (f5-f6ch).} Rfc8 {[!?]  Instead, the GKE suggested 24...Qxa2  25.Rg1 Qa3  26.Be2 Nxd5 which looks pretty good for White, but then comes 27.Rxg7ch! Kxg7  28.Bh6ch  Kxh6  29.Qxa3 Bxf5  30.Qf3 Nf4  31.Rc6 (?!).  After this wild sequence, I rather think I would prefer to have the Black pieces!} 25. Rxc8 Rxc8 {Black pretty much owns the Q-side, but has she enough going on there to counter-balance White's K-side operations?    The GKE assessed the game marginally in Black's favour: -0.51.  Black has the better structure, and the White a-pawn is living on sufferance, but White has the more active pieces.} 26. Ne4 Rc2 {[?!]  Giving up the exchange!  Was Black's game under such pressure, or was she contemplating a counter-stroke?  No good was 26...Nxd5?? 27.Ng5ch Bxg5 28.f6ch Kg8  29.Bxg5, so that can be laid to rest.  How about 26...Qxa2 instead?  Let's see: 27.Bg5 Qa4 (threatening ...Nxe4)  28.Bxf6 gxf6!  29.Qg4 Rg8  30.Ng5ch! fxg5  31.f6ch! ... (even with such scanty material to hand, the position is a real maelstrom)  31...Kh6  32.hxg5ch Rxg5 33.Qxa4 Bxa4  34.fxe7 Rxh5ch 35.Kg2.  The GKE calls this even, but I rather think Black might have an edge in this position.  What a melee, though!} 27. Bxc2 Qxc2 {I can only surmise that Black wished to draw the teeth from the bishop on the dangerous  b1-h7 diagonal.} 28. Nxf6+ Bxf6 29. h6 {Interestingly, the GKE called White's advantage significant after Black's 26...Rc2, but this assessment has been trending downwards so rapidly, that it is calling the game near-on even at this point.  Maybe it preferred 29.Bg5 as an improvement?} gxh6 30. Qg4 {Aiming for 31.Rg1 and mate on g8.} Qa4 {Active defence: White isn't allowed tine to develop his attack down the g-file, and, in view of the 'X-ray' attack against the h4-pawn, White must exchange queens...} 31. Qxa4 Bxa4 {The middle game melee is over, and now we enter an endgame in which Black has an extra pawn for the exchange (i.e. P and B for R).  The 'bishop pair' helps Black, as do her slightly more solid pawns in the centre.  All White's pawns are isolated and weak. At this point, I would not have given much for White's winning chances, but he's not prepared to flag it away yet!} 32. Rb1 {Indirect and active defence of the h-pawn.  If now 32...Bxh4, comes 33.Rb6 Be7  34.Rb7, one way or another obtaining a passed pawn on the 5th rank.  That is White's immediate aim: to obtain a passed pawn.} Kg7 33. Rg1+ {Locking the Black King in his corner.  But this requires the rook to maintain the prison indefinitely.  The White bishop and King have to take up the slack.} Kh7 {Forced.} 34. Kg2 {Clever.  White brings his King into action, and Black can not reciprocate.  That the rook's action down the g-file is temporarily masked is of no help to Black, as after ...Kg7, Kf3ch forces the King back to h7.} Bc2 {Nothing to stop her counter-attacking, though.  To save the f-pawn, White would have to release the Black King from jail after all (35.Rf1 Kg7).} 35. Kf3 {White prefers to give up a pawn.  To my mind, though, the evening up of material must leave White's winning prospects problematical at best, and Black can start rethinking her chances as well.} Bxf5 36. h5 Bd3 {Threatening 37...Bc4 attacking d- and a-pawns.  But the real motive is to commit the rook to preventing that happening, whereat the Black King might yet effect an escape.} 37. Rc1 Kg7 38. Bd2 {The problem of weak pawns: too many to defend, even for the bishop pair.} a4 {I did wonder about whether 38....Bg5 was feasible here: 39.Bxg5 hxg5  40.Rc6 Kh6  41.Rxd6ch Kxh5  42.Rf6 g4ch  43.Ke3 Kg5 44.Rxf7... This looks winning for White.  So we can write off ...Bg5.} 39. Rc6 {Black's d-pawn looks like a goner: 39...Be7 40.Bb4} e4+ 40. Kg4 Be2+ {As her d-pawn must fall, Black seeks compensation elsewhere: the White h-pawn.} 41. Kf4 {A surprising choice that the GKE calls in error.  I think I would have played 41.Kf5 myself, but I am not convinced that is all that much of an improvement over the text - not if White wants to win: 41.Kf5  Bd3 (Threat ...e3ch) 42.Bxh6ch Kxh6  43.Kxf5 Kxh5 44.Kxf7 e3  45.Rc1 e2 46.Ke6 Kg4 47.Kxd6 Kf3 48.Ke5 Bc4  49.Rc3ch Kf2  50.Rc2 Kf1  51.Rc1ch e1=Qch  52.Rxe1ch Kxe1 53. Kd4 Bxa2 54.Kc5 ... and this ending is drawn.} Bxh5 {An alternative was 41....Bg5ch 42.Kxe4 Bxd2.  Does this win a piece and the game?  No: 43.Rc2 f5ch!  44.Kd4 Kf6  45.Rxd2 Bxh5 with an unclear position.} 42. Kxe4 Bg6+ 43. Kf3 Bb1 44. a3 Ba2 {This is starting to look good for White.  The GKE evaluations have been trending more in his favour, too, in recent moves.  What further obstacles can Black throw into his path?  Well, the threat here is ...Bxd5ch, so...} 45. Rxd6 { ...white might as well at last take the d-pawn...} Be7 {... and submit to the skewer in reply.} 46. Rd7 Bxa3 47. Bc3+ Kg6 48. Ke4 h5 {[?!] The GKE prefers 8...f6, but it is not clear why.  } 49. Ra7 Bb1+ 50. Kf3 Ba2 {Offering to exchange pawns (51.Rxa4 Bxd5ch), after which Black can rest assured of the draw at least, and even explore winning chances.} 51. d6 {[!] Well played White!  It emerges that Black has to shed a bishop to stop this pawn's promotion.} Bd5+ {[!] Fine defence.  White has to be careful where the King goes, or Black picks up the d-pawn for nothing.  So 52.Ke2 Bc4ch 53.K moves Bxd6 is ruled out.  Nor may White  play to a dark square on the f- and g-files on account of a bishop check, winning something.  But one move remains, therefore...} 52. Ke3 {[!] The 'only' move.} Bc5+ {A fork!  But White has a reposte:} 53. Bd4 {[!]  } Bxd6 {[!] There was no choice.  Instead 53...Bxa7 54.d7! won for White.} 54. Ra6 {Pinning the bishop against the King, with no defence available.  Black makes the best she can of the situation.} Be6 {[!] 'Only move'.} 55. Rxd6 a3 56. Ra6 a2 {And this is the obstacle thrown in White's path: a pawn that is about to promote and must be watched.} 57. Kf4 {A fascinating situation!  White has rook for three pawns all of which are isolated and reliant on Black pieces, the bishop in particular, for protection.  The bishops stand on opposite coloured squares, which is very often a help to the weaker side.    The Black bishop might be classed as a 'Bad Bishop' as all the pawns stand on its colour complex.  But here is where a 'Bad Bishop' comes into its own.  Anchored securely in the centre by the f-pawn, it offers protection to the other two pawns, and there is nothing White can effect against them.  White has the 'wrong coloured' Bishop!  So White has to try and induce a weakening by creating mating threats or (if it is possible) setting up a zugzwang that will induce one of the Black pawns to advance to an unprotected (i.e. dark) square.} h4 {Hurrying to the most advanced protected square...} 58. Ra5 Kh6 59. Ra8 h3 60. Ba1 {Marking time.  Can White win this?  Janet (brigadecommander) thought so, and although my first 'first impression' was that Black had set up a nice 'fortress', I became more inclined to agree.  But analysis showed... well, let us see what analysis showed.  I'll be referring readers to a Club Forum on endgames for more detailed analysis.} Kg6 {Black would like to bring the king somewhere in mid-board, after which White can whistle for the win.  But the confined position of the Black King is what gives White reason to hope a win can be found.} 61. Rg8+ Kh7 {[?] Very risky, in my view, and ,,,Kh6 or ...Kh5 ought to have been preferred.} 62. Rh8+ {If this really is White's best, then the game probably is objectively a draw.  62.Rg7ch had to be worth a look, though.} Kg6 63. Re8 Kh5 64. Bb2 {Unable to find a win, White offered a draw, gleefully accepted by Black.  After 64...Kg6  65.Rh8 Black is almost, but not quite, movebound.  None of the pawns could safely move, and the King would have had no moves at all.  That leaves the bishop.  Bishop moves to f5 or g4 simply lost the bishop; and any move to d5, c4 or b3 lost the h-pawn to a skewer.  But Black had one remaining move 65...Bd7!! that would have saved the game.
