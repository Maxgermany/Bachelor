1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This game was played in a themed MT with reference to Brigadecommander's (Janet's)  Stonewall Project which has thrown up some very interesting results.  For your's truly it was another milestone.  I actually defeated a former Expert who is a Runner in our Walking the Walk and Learning to Run group who resigned on the grounds of UNAVIOIDABLE MATE! Glen lost a lot of rating points partly due to form and timeout issues.  At the start of this game his rating was 1908 so I had to be content with only my third near-Expert Victory and retain my current username rather than an Expert Victory and the username "The Black Queen".  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on .......} d5 {1. ..... d5 - here is a double queen pawn opening.  However, the next move does not follow the standard c4 which is the Queen's Gambit.  It is this move that is the start of the Stonewall.} 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bd3 e6 4. Nd2 {4. Nd2 - For now, all is calm.} c5 5. c3 {5. c3 - maintaining the Stonewall.} Nc6 6. f4 Bd6 7. Ngf3 {7. Ngf3 - looks as though there will be a mutual knight entrenchment on the squares e4 and e5!} O-O 8. Ne5 cxd4 9. exd4 {9. exd4 - pawn trade.} Bxe5 10. fxe5 {10. fxe5 - B for N trade.} Nd7 11. O-O Qb6 12. Kh1 {12. Kh1 - still all is calm.  Henry is evading the line of the Wicked Witch of the West along the g1-a7 diagonal.  That is what will make what comes next even more unbelievable.} f6 13. Qh5 {13. Qh5 - suddenly Glenda decides to fly on her broomstick to the square h5 and put King Glenn in Old Matey's shadow.  Aggressive move no.1.} f5 14. Nb3 {14. Nb3 - this seemingly non-aggressive move allows Fou Lenoir to get in on the action.  I have the square g5 in mind for him.} g6 15. Qh6 {15. Qh6 - Glenda occupies this berth for the rest of the game.  If only I can get another unit in there.  King Glenn is now shivering!} Rf7 16. Bg5 a5 17. Rab1 {17. Rab1 - to release my knight to come back to the kingside.} a4 18. Nd2 a3 19. b4 {19. b4 - I now move my pawn to a square where it can be defended by another pawn.  Glenn is starting to get tied up a bit on both sides of the board.} Rf8 20. Rf3 {20. Rf3 - rook lift preparing to go to h3.} Rf7 21. Rh3 Ra4 22. Bc2 Ra7 23. Nf3 {23. Nf3 - this knight is heading for g5.} Qb5 24. Bf6 Nf8 {24. .... Nf8 - hmm, why not NxB?} 25. Ng5 {25. Ng5 - and let the cavalry advance!} Rd7 26. Bd3 Qa4 27. b5 Nb8 28. b6 Ra5 {28. .... Ra5 - Glenn continues to be bottled up on the queenside - although I will still have to keep my eye on his QR and the Witch.} 29. g4 {29. g4?! - Nxe6 followed by Nxe6 30. Bxf5 was recommended by Gameknot Analysis.  However, this move was to prepare to blast open the files leading to King Glen and stick a rook on either the f or g column as appropriate.} Qc6 30. gxf5 exf5 31. Bxf5 {31. Bxf5 - here comes the bishop sac.  If Fou Leblanc is taken then my rook will come to g1 (conditional move set) and threaten a nasty discovered check (Nxh7+) with mate to follow in short order.} Rb5 32. Rg1 {32. Rg1 - here Glenn waves the white flag.  He is now a pawn down and Bxg6 is threatened next move followed by what was said in my previous note.  Gameknot Analysis indicated #in 8 from here.  I am really chuffed that a mating attack of mine against a former Expert has been so successful and I hope there will be more of these to come!  For now, read and enjoy - Kind regards - Joanne}
