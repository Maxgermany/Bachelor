1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. e3 cxd4 {I have always considered this a good exchange.} 4. exd4 d5 {Most common.} 5. Nf3 e6 6. Nc3 a6 {Slow but I wanted to prevent the knight from harassing my pieces.} 7. c5 {I think this release of tension loosens White's position more than it poses problems for Black.} Nc6 8. a3 g6 9. Bd3 {Now this piece has to bite on stone. All of my pawns block him.} Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. Be3 b5 {This move would not be possible if White had not advanced his c-pawn.} 12. cxb6 e.p. Qxb6 13. b4 Ng4 {Not really intending to exchange, just coaxing weaknesses from White's position.} 14. Na4 Qc7 15. Be2 Ne7 16. Rc1 Qd6 17. Bg5 Nf5 {I'd rather keep this knight.} 18. h3 Nf6 19.

Qe1 will lead to the same result after 35. ... Ne2+.} Ne2+ 36. Kh2 Bc3 37. Qxc1 Nxc1 38. b6 f6 39. b7 Rf8 {The rook has cannot leave the last rank anyway. 40. Bxf8 Be5+.} 40. a4 d2 41.
