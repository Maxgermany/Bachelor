1. e4 {Team Match, I play white and go for the open game.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez.} a6 4. Ba4 {Morphy Defense, standard reply.} Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 {5. ... Nxe4 is the Open Defense, I play the standard reply.} exd4 7. Re1 {6. ... exd4 is the inferior Riga Variation.} d5 8. Bg5 {8. Nxd4 is good here, but I found this in the GK DB and thought it would be fun too. Follows the "don't move the same piece twice" opening principle.} f6 9. Nxd4 {Beginning a little exchange variation that favors white.} fxg5 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Bxc6+ {Forking the king and rook.} Bd7 12. Qxd5 {Black might have expected Rxa8, but white has more aggressive plans.} Bxc6 13. Rxe4+ {Check.} Be7 14. Qxc6+ {Check again.} Kf8 15. Nc3 {After all that, white is just a pawn ahead. But black's pawn structure is weakened on both sides and white is leaps and bounds ahead in development. Well, maybe 1 leap or 1 bound. 15. Nf3 develops a piece, but far more importantly, it guards against Qd1#.} h5 16. Rd1 {Love those open files.} Qe8 17. Qxc7 {Isolated, undefended, and evidently unloved. How could I let the little fellow continue on, knowing how miserable he must have been?} Rc8 18. Qa5 Qg6 19. Rde1 {Black's queen gets into the game, threatening a well-defended rook, but also defending the pawn at a6.} Re8 20. Re4e6 {I like a ! for this move. Sure, it threatens the obvious capture on a6, but white would have gotten that pawn eventually. It also gives up the pawn on c2. The trade seems to favor black (trading a supported white pawn for an isolated black pawn). But the threat on a6 is only the obvious threat.} Qxc2 21. Re6xe7 {A nice little sacrifice. White attacked the bishop twice, but it was defended twice. While the black queen stood at g6, she defended e8, and this sacrifice would have failed. But she went gallivanting off to the far side of the board, and now e8 is weak, and the sacrifice works.} Rxe7 22. Qd8+ {21. ... Qg6 might hold the position a little longer than 21. ... Rxe7, but black was pretty much doomed either way: 21. ... Qg6 22. Rxe8  Qxe8 23. Rxe8  Kxe8 24. Qc7 Rh6 25. Nd5 Re6 26. Qc8  Kf7 27. Qd7  Kf8 28. Qxe6 leaves white an easy endgame up by queen, knight, and pawn. At this point, white entered the final moves as conditional moves.} Kf7 23. Rxe7+ Kf6 24. Qd6+ {A straightforward king-walk.} Kf5 25. Re5+ {More king-walking.} Kf4 26. Qd4+ {Black resigned rather than sacrifice his lovely bride with 26. ... Qe4, 27. Qxe4#.}
