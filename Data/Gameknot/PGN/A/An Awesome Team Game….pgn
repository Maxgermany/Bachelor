This might be good in the toward the end.} Re8 {I copy, because I don't see anything I can do. I'm waiting for an opportunity.} 12.

Ng5, threatens the rook and mate after Nxf3.} Ng5 {Ng5. My plan begins.} 25. Rh4 {Retreats. Now, for the bait…} Nxf3 {At a glance one would think. 'Huh? sacrifice a knight for a pawn. Maybe they didn't see the pawn on g3'. But if one looked closer…} 26. gxf3 {Takes the bait. Now mate in 3.} Qxf3+ {Check.} 27. Kg1 {Forced to move their unless mate in 1 is wanted.} Rg6+ {I check with the rook, and my opponent is forced to block with the queen, with would result in checkmate. My opponent resigns.
