1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  Have you ever been in a dodgy position against a lower rated player and considered trying to buy your way out of it with a draw offer in order to concede a few points to avoid the loss of many?  I certainly did in this game but guess what, my gut instinct kicked in and told me to hang fire.  I'm glad I listened to it because my opponent timed out!  Anyhow on with the action, white kicks off with 1. Nf3 the Reti Opening.} Nf6 2. d4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 {4. Bg2 - the kingside is fairly symmetrical here.} O-O 5. O-O d6 6. Nc3 Nbd7 {6. ........ Nbd7 - development.} 7. Qd3 c6 8. e4 e5 {8. ......... e5 - at last I challenge the centre.  White still has a positional plus here, more pieces active.} 9. Bg5 Qc7 {9. ......... Qc7 - unpin.} 10. Rad1 exd4 11. Qxd4 {11. Qxd4 - pawn trade.} Ne8 12. Qe3 f6 {12. ....... f6 - I try to drive off that enemy bishop but he moves to h6.} 13. Bh6 Ne5 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 {14. ........ Kxg7 - bishop trade.} 15. Ne2 Rf7 16. b3 Re7 {16. ....... Re7 - keeping an eye open for that knight on e2 - that horsie could jump onto d4 or f4 threatening to come to e6 and fork Henry and Glenda.} 17. Qc3 Bg4 {17. ........ Bg4 - development.} 18. Rd2 Rd8 19. Rfd1 Rdd7 20. Qe3 b6 {20. ........ b6 - this pawn move screens out the Wicked Witch of the West.  My knight on e8 cuts a very forlorn figure.} 21. h3 Nxf3+ 22. Bxf3 Bxf3 23. Qxf3 {23. Qxf3 - a trade of 2 sets of pieces does not entirely solve my spatial issues.} Re5 24. Nf4 Rde7 25. Re1 Kh8 {25. ....... Kh8? - Maybe Kg8 was better.  I will explain more towards the end.} 26. c4 {26. c4 - pawn roll.} Ng7 {26. ........ Ng7 - at last with the d6 pawn defended by Glenda (now who else?!) my horsie can improve his position.  This knight move also gives added protection to e6.} 27. b4 f5 {27. ........ f5 - this move triggers an exchange of pawns.} 28. Rde2 fxe4 29. Re2xe4 Rf7 {29. ....... Rf7!? - here I try to complicate things.  If I continue to trade on the e file I will end up with a very passive Q + Kt v Q + Kt ending.  After I played this move I worked out an interesting sequence.  This sequence was not played because it was here that black timed out.  It goes like this:-  30. Rxe5 dxe5  31. Rxe5 Qxe5  32. Nxg6+ hxg6  33. Qxf7 Qe1+  34. Kh2 Qxb4  35. Qxa7 Qxc4  36. Qxb6 Qxa2  37. Qxc6 Qb1   I would prefer to be white in that final position and I would have probably have negotiated a low draw there.  Which colour would you the jury prefer to be?  I will leave it to you.}
