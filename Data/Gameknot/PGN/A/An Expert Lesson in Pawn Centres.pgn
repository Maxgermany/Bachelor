1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here's me in action against Coach Ion.  I thought that I would try the Bishop's Opening against him and try and get a game like my evergreen Battle of the Wings against him.  It didn't work out, however, and I ended up losing my 7th game on the bounce against him, aargh! - Joanne} e5 2. Bc4 {2. Bc4 - the Bishop's Opening - gives a myriad of possibilities for both sides.  Some beginners may play it as a prelude to the Scholar's Mate but I know that it is not a good way to go.  So I go by the book until Move 16.} Nf6 3. d3 Nc6 4. Nf3 Be7 5. O-O O-O {5. ....... 0-0 - both sides develop their kingside pieces and castle.} 6. Re1 d6 7. c3 Na5 8. Bb5 {8. Bb5 - I would like to preserve Frere Leblanc if possible and try and get him on the b1-h7 diagonal pointing towards the black king if possible.} a6 9. Ba4 b5 10. Bc2 {10. Bc2 - mission accomplished.} c5 11. Nbd2 Nd7 12. Nf1 Bf6 13. Ne3 Nb6 {13. ......... Nb6 - these 2 horses support the queenside pawn push.} 14. h3 g6 15. Ng4 Bg7 16. Bd2 {16. Bd2? - just as I come out of the database I make my first error.  Bg5 was recommended which would attack the Wicked Witch of the West.  However, I played through the rest of that game and found that neither Experts noticed that white's b pawn was en prise for several moves.  As I thought that Frere Lenoir would only be driven back I thought it was a perfectly reasonable plan to put him on d2 and then put Glenda behind him on c1 and then play Frere Lenoir to h6.  White is fully developed and seems to have a reasonable position but Ion came up with a gem ....... f5!! driving my knight back after the pawns are exchanged on f5.} f5 17. exf5 gxf5 18. Ne3 f4 {18. ........ f4 - this pawn move can be a killer in more ways than one.  Because of this move Ion has the luxury of denuding his own king to mount a pawn storm on my own.  Most of my pieces will be cut off from Henry leaving him to fend for himself.  I am now wondering whether a king move to h1 followed by a rook move to g1 and a pawn move to g3 might have been a better plan, but I try to hit out on the queenside - to no good avail.} 19. Nf1 Bf5 20. a3 Nc6 21. b4 c4 22. dxc4 Bxc2 23. Qxc2 Nxc4 24. Bc1 {24. Bc1 - two pawns and one set of minor pieces have been exchanged but Ion increases his spatial advantage - just look at that pawn centre, ominous or what?!} d5 25. Bb2 e4 26. Nf3d2 Nc6e5 27. Nxc4 bxc4 {27. ......... bxc4 - this pawn recapture ensures that my knight cannot go to b3 and c1 to drive out a knight incursion on d3.} 28. Red1 Nd3 29. Rd2 f3 30. g3 {30. g3 - I try to keep my kingside castling position as closed as possible but it is still starting to look draughty.} Qd7 31. Kh2 Nf4 {31. ......... Nf4 - Ion decides to sac his knight - taking it will be suicide as it will allow a deadly check from his dsb on e5 and then Henry will have to retreat to g1 or h1 and then the Wicked Witch will take the pawn on h3 and then come in on g2 dealing death.  The only alternative to avoid dropping a pawn is the text but it only holds him off for another 7 moves.} 32. g4 h5 33. Ne3 {33. Ne3 - at last my knight can come to Henry's aid but it is all very flimsy.  Ion's king is almost completely bare as it will be when the dsb moves to e5 next move.  But with the centre locked as it is there is no way I can take advantage of it.} Be5 34. Rad1 {34. Rad1 - an attempt at counterplay on the d file but ....} Nd3+ {34 ........ Nd3  - not only uncovers a nasty discovery, fortunately none of my pieces were in the knight's path but the knight incursion on d3 blocks off the d file and scotches any ideas I may have there.} 35. Kh1 hxg4 36. Nxg4 {36. Nxg4 - I take with the knight hoping to bring my rook onto g1 facing the black king.  I do succeed in this but it becomes only a spite check.} Qh7 37. Rg1 Qxh3+ 38. Nh2+ Kh8 {38. ........ Kh8 - here I wave the white flag on the grounds of unavoidable mate on g2 or h2 and there is no way I can try and get a perpetual with Glenda and my other rook all bottled up on the queenside.  A sorry end.  Hope you have enjoyed this lesson.  For further examples of this type of attack I would recommend you read J N Walker's Attack on the King which devotes a chapter to how locking up the centre can lead to mating attacks on the enemy king when you castle on the same side as your opponent.  If your opponent's pieces are locked in on the other side of the board you can afford to expose your king here.  A cautionary tale however is that if the centre is not locked then you may be punished for moving pawns in front of your castled king as Glenda has netted a few lower rated victims that way!  Anyhow, I will not give up the fight, one day I will get my first half point against an Expert!  Unitl then I will keep smiling.  Cheers - Joanne  }
