1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. e3 {Not one of the most played answers to the Budapest, so I had to think. } Bb4+ {The pressing line, which have some risks for both players. } 4. Nc3 {Ne4, Bd2, and all I get is Nxlsb... not bad, but not very much. And e5 is hanging. If Nc6, d5, so...} exd4 {If Qx, I win a tempo with Nc6.} 5. exd4 Ne4 {Pressing on c3.} 6. Qc2 {Qe7 begs to be played, but Be3 solves white's problems and I can't avoid it. Here, a brave option is f5, but I was playing against a 1600, you know... he has no developement, but my K is naked. } Nxc3 {Throwing away one of my advantages. } 7. bxc3 {Now I didn't realize the problem I'll be in with my lsb. } Qe7+ 8. Be3 {As said, I can't avoid this one. Now: where do I put my lsb, after Qa5?} Bd6 {This ugly  move because if o-o-o, c5 - only way to save the B and let Nb8 a square to develop in. } 9. Bd3 {As expected, it was played authomatically, without thinking...} Bf4 {...on this one. White has to defend again, Qe2, and I can exchange at will, holding a decent position despite the white's pawns.} 10. Nf3 {Does he want to revenge against h7? I'd be a bad bargain!} Bxe3 11. fxe3 Qxe3+ 12. Qe2 Qxe2+ 13. Bxe2 {Much better was to take with the K, connecting R at once, and keeping the B on the good square. Now I would have needed much more time to study my developement. I got to be the undeveloped one... for a single pawn. } d6 14. Ng5 f6 {Thank you white, you gave me very important tempoes. Still, the best move here was castling. White has Bh5+, which is not dangerous now because of g6, but later on, it will make f6 weak. So I should have defended starting by castling instead. } 15. Ne4 {Now Bf5 was called for. } Kf7 {? } 16. O-O {...and now I am threatened of Bh5+, and still I played, foolishly...} Re8 {Now. It seems a losing move, because of Bh5+, and after g6, Rxf6+. But, after Kg7, what does white have other than two threatened pieces? So I realized what was a mistake had its tricky side. Now, what about Nxc6 instead, threatening the R? I could have well taken the B in h5 and if NxR, KxN and I have two pieces (and ugly pawns) against a R. Another game...} 17. Bd3 {? I understand he wants to defend, and maybe feared the complications. Now, both players have made positional mistakes, but surely my position is worse, and a pawn doesn't compensate, unless I can survive the storm. Now, this move is played to avoid Kg6 after Ng5+. It would lead my K to the first row, and h7 will fall... as everything. So I have to be "creative". } f5 {Can I put a ! on this unnatural move? If Ng5+ now I can play Kg6, then h4 to defend, h6 to kick him out... another game!} 18. Rae1 {!? It further complicates things, and I got distracted by a call. I was considering Kg6 anyway, but I feared it was then very easy for him to set a R lift and get a mate net. } Kf8 {? The intended move was Kg8. A costly blunder. } 19. Ng5 {Now, I have to play RxR first, but I was not fully into the game. A pity. } h6 20. Nh7+ Kf7 {Incredibly, my position still "seems to" hold, and now the white N seems trapped with no escape. White has to take Bxf5, but has to exchange R first. RxR, KxR, Bxf5 and white is ok, has recovered the pawn and the game can go on. } 21. Bxf5 {? My turn to benefit from my opponent's omissions. } Rxe1 {I thought I was very smarte: BxB+, RxR+, KxR... and BLACK IS BUSTED due to the threat on b7! But I didn't realize it during the game. } 22. Rxe1 {? Throwing away the win. } Bxf5 23. Ng5+ {Rf1 first was still much better. Kg6 is the only option, and his N can escape via f8+. If Kgoes to f, g4 wins the B...} hxg5 24. Rf1 Kg6 {The dust has settled, and I have two free pieces. I can still put myself into some trouble, but as long as I control his R's penetration, there is no point in going on. } 25. h3 Nc6 26. g4 Bd3 27. Rf3 Bxc4 28. Re3 Bxa2 {The white R still can't penetrate, there is nothing to fight for. } 29. Kg2 Rf8 30. Kg3 Bd5 31. h4 gxh4+ 32. Kxh4 Rh8+ 33. Kg3 Rh1 {No real plan, but it's a matter of time. My opponent gave up. }
