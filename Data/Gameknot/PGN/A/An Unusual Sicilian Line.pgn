1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This is a game in which I played against a buddy of Freddy the Master Mater which ended in a loss for me.  His name is Craig.  He played a very unusual line of the Sicilian after I kicked off with 1. e4.  He responded c5 and I played the standard Nf3.} c5 2. Nf3 f5 {2. ...... f5 - an unusual line, a gambit.  I decided to accept the gambit and see what happened.} 3. exf5 Nc6 4. d4 d5 5. dxc5 Bxf5 {5. ...... Bxf5 - pawn trade.} 6. Bb5 a6 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 {7. ....... bxc6 - N for B trade.} 8. b4 Nf6 9. Bb2 a5 10. c3 Qb8 11. a3 {12. a3 - my b4 pawn needs to be bolstered.} e5 12. Qe2 e4 13. Nd4 {13. Nd4 - hoping to keep my knight on this good outpost.} Bd7 14. Bc1 Be7 15. Be3 {15. Be3 - I now redeploy my bishop because I am hoping to complete my development on the queenside and then castle.} O-O 16. h3 Bd8 17. Nd2 {17. Nd2? - this move sets off a plethora of exchanges which results in Craig getting his pawn back.  Was 0-0 better?} axb4 18. cxb4 Qxb4 19. axb4 Rxa1+ 20. Qd1 {20. Qd1 - forced.} Rxd1+ 21. Kxd1 {21. Kxd1 - a lot of wood has been cleared.  Craig will be able to make use of the a column.} Bc7 22. Kc2 Ra8 23. Rb1 {23. Rb1 - to defend my backward b4 pawn.} Be5 24. g4 h5 25. g5 Ne8 26. h4 {26. h4 - Over the last 2 moves I decided to put my pawns on dark squares that would be difficult for the black dsb to attack.  Craig's horsie does a tour de France to the queenside with devastating effect however.} Nc7 27. Nf1 Bxd4 28. Bxd4 {28. Bxd4 - piece trade.} Nb5 29. Bb2 {29. Bb2 - this move is forced because I must get Fou Lenoir out of the knight's attack and prevent a fork on a3.  It leaves my f2 pawn weak though and this is gonna drop off.} Rf8 30. Ng3 Rxf2+ 31. Kc1 Bg4 32. Be5 {32. Be5 - I decide to improve Fou Lenoir's position but black's move e3 kills things off stone dead.  I wave the white flag because I will have to give up my knight to stop that e pawn from crowning into the Wicked Witch of the West and getting at Henry.  Well played Craig - Joanne} e3 {}
