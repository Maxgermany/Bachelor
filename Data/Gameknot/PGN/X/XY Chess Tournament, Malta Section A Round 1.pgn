1. d4 {My club mate manages to draw with a German International Master - with black too!} d5 2. c4 c6 {Starts off as a Slav Defence} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 {4. Nc3 is more usual, leaving the option of developing Bc1 to f4 or g5.} e6 5. b3 {There is some logic in b3 - if the Bc1 can't go to f4 or g5, may as well put it on b2 - however 5. Nc3 (and other moves!) are more common.} Ne4 6. Bd3 f5 {Turning it into a Dutch Stonewall set-up.} 7. O-O Nd7 8. Bb2 {Surprisingly, I can't find this natural move in any of the (limited) opening databases I use.} Be7 9. Qc1 {Richard comments "Qc1 seems a little slow".} O-O 10. Ba3 {The point of Qc1 becomes clear - to exchange black's good bishop - but black's position remains fundamentally sound.} Bxa3 11. Qxa3 Rf6 {Black starts the usual king-side attack.} 12. g3 {Richard wondered if white is slightly worried by this attack.} Rh6 13. h4 Ndf6 14. Nbd2 Ng4 15. Bxe4 dxe4 16. Ne5 {Richard comments that after 16. Nh2 he would have taken a draw with 16...Nxh2 17. Kxh2 Rxh4+ 18. gxh4 Qxh4+ and perpetual check. He also points out that the attempt to win the piece with 16.....Nxe5 17. dxe5 Qxd2 loses to 18. R(either!) d1 and after the queen moves Rd8 leads to a mating attack for white. } Rxh4 {But this still draws. If 17. Nxg4 then Rxg4 and black is a pawn up and after Qf3 he should manage to complete his development.} 17. gxh4 {so white takes the rook.} Qxh4 {Queen takes back, threatening mate.} 18. Nxg4 {So white avoids that.} Qxg4+ {But walks into a perpetual check. Draw agreed!
