[Opening "QGD (D09), Albin counter-gambit, 5.g3"]

1. d4 {Having lost with black to a highly rated player from Malta in the second round, I rather expected an easier game with white in the next round. Well I was drawn with black, and instead of meeting the 4th seed, I was paired against the 5th seed, Patrick Zerafa (2069), a Candidate Master with black! I started white's clock. The tournament organisers explained that he had a full-time job in Malta, and he would come straight from work. Normally the default time is 30 minutes, but I was told that as he had indicated that he would be late, he had an hour to arrive. I waited and waited... but he never showed up, and I was awarded the game by default.} d5 {Then in round 3 I was paired against Arne, from Germany and at last I was given white.} 2. c4 {I played the Queen's Gambit.} e5 {He plays the Albin counter-gambit. Although this opening was originally played by Cavallotti against Salvioli at the Milan tournament of 1881, it takes its name from Adolf Albin, who played it against Lasker in New York 1893. Though not played frequently at the master level, Russian Grandmaster Alexander Morozevich has recently made some successful use of it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albin_Countergambit } 3. dxe5 {The recommended reply for white.} d4 {And the usual move by black.  In exchange for the gambit pawn, Black has a central wedge at d4 and gets some chances for an attack. Often White will try to return the pawn at an opportune moment to gain a positional advantage.} 4. Nf3 {Attacking d4. The careless move 4.e3? can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3 6.Bxb4?? is a blunderâ€”6...exf2+ 7.Ke2 fxg1=N+! and Black wins. The Lasker Trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion in practical play.} Nc6 {And protecting d4 again. 4...c5 allows 5.e3 because Black no longer has the bishop check on b4.} 5. g3 {The usual way to continue, as 5. e3? still, fails to Bb4+!} f6 {Turning it into a real gambit, rather than playing Ng8-e7 or developing the Bc8.} 6. exf6 {So I take.} Be6 {This is unusual and unexpected and caused me to have a long think. I didn't know it at the time, but black has just left any opening database I have access to. Recapturing on f6 with either knight or queen has been played before.} 7. Ng5 {Fritz prefers f6xg7 but that seemed a bit greedy to me.} Bxc4 {So he takes.} 8. f7+ {I throw in a check. Fritz prefers taking on g7 followed by e2-e4 with the threat of a queen check on h5.} Bxf7 {He takes.} 9. Nxf7 {I take back. I was rather expecting Kxf7 when I can play 10. Qb3+ and pick up the b pawn and weaken his queen-side. However....} Qd5 {He counter-attacks my rook. Fritz prefers 9....Bb4+} 10. Nxh8 {So I take.} Qxh1 {He takes back. What would you play here dear reader?} 11. Bg5 {Played to stop 0-0-0. Fritz prefers 11. Qb3} Qd5 {His queen comes back.} 12. Qb3 {Fritz likes this move.} Bb4+ {He throws in a check.} 13. Nd2 {Fritz actually prefers the bishop block.} Qxg5 {And he is threatening mate, however...} 14. Qxg8+ {I take the knight with check. Again, although this seems very natural, Fritz prefers the queen check on f7 followed by f2-h4.} Ke7 {He has to avoid Kd7? 15. Bh3+} 15. Qf7+ {My queen was attacked.} Kd6 {So that his rook can take my knight. I now need to do something about his threat to take on d2 with mate.} 16. O-O-O {So I castle, removing the knight from the pin by the bishop, but walking into a pin from the queen. I can always get out of that pin with f2-f4 of course.} Bxd2+ {He decides to stop my knight from becoming active.} 17. Rxd2 {I take back.} Rxh8 {And he takes my knight off.} 18. f4 {I couldn't see any other way of making progress. Maybe 18. Bh3 was better?} Qf6 {His queen drops back.} 19. Qxf6+ {I take off queens. I was looking at 19. Qc4 but couldn't see anything concrete, but it may have been better.} gxf6 {He takes back.} 20. e3 {I threaten to win his e pawn.} Re8 {He find the best reply, now threatening to win my e pawn.} 21. exd4 {So I take. I offered a draw here, I could see the next few moves and felt the position to be very level.} Re1+ {He throws in a check, forking my king and bishop.} 22. Rd1 {My only defence.} Rxd1+ {He takes.} 23. Kxd1 {I take back.} Nxd4 {He takes my pawn. I need to activate my king, but Kd2 runs into Nf3+ winning my h pawn, so I stop that by....} 24. Bg2 {Also attacking b7. I was rather expecting simply c6 here, but he is playing for a win so...} b5 {He plays this.} 25. Kd2 {I advance my king.} c5 {He continues with his queen-side advances.} 26. Kd3 {I centralise my king more.} a5 {He advances again.} 27. g4 {I start advancing, my king-side majority.} Ne6 {his knight drops back-} 28. Ke4 {My king advances.} c4 {He advances again.} 29. h4 {And so do I.} Nc5+ {He throws in a knight check.} 30. Kd4 {Although I was tempted to play Kf5, I was concerned at his knight coming into d3, taking on b2 and his pawns becoming a problem. Now I expected him to check on e6 again, my king goes back to e4 and it it a draw. However....} Nd3 {He plays this, forking my pawns on f4 and b2. It looks good for him, but I have a strong reply....} 31. Be4 {This! I am now threatening to take twice on d3 to win a pawn, and reach a won pawn ending. So his knight is rather forced to one of my pawns, but then I take his h7 pawn and my h pawn is really dangerous - an outside passed pawn, just what I need to win this. I think black's position is lost now.} Nxb2 {He takes this one.} 32. Bxh7 {I take that one. His problem is that it is hard for him to advance his queen-side pawns quickly, while my king-side pawns are free to move.} b4 {He tries this.} 33. h5 {I advance the outside pawn.} a4 {He advances again.} 34. h6 {So do I. } Ke7 {His king hurries back to defend.} 35. g5 {I advance again.} b3 {So does he.} 36. Bb1 {My bishop hurries back to stop his pawn.} bxa2 {He takes.} 37. Bxa2 {I take back.} Kf7 {His king comes across to stop my advances.} 38. Bxc4+ {Now if he exchanges on c4, he has a lost pawn ending, so...} Kg6 {He tries this.} 39. Bd3+ {But this is very strong. Again the pawn ending is lost if he exchanges on d3.} Kf7 {This is more or less forced.} 40. g6+ {But now I have two protected passed pawns.} Kg8 {His positional is resignable.} 41. Bc4+ {The bishop's return to c4 is enough to force his resignation. Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two, award the annotation on the star system, to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
