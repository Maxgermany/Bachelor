[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C71), Noah's ark trap"]

1. e4 {Paul Keres is a name that I recognised, but this is the first time that I've looked at any of his games... and after looking at this one, and learning a little more about him, I think I'll be checking out more of his games! (Fun fact; he is the only player to have beaten nine undisputed world champions!) As far as I'm aware, this isn't one of his more famous games, but definitely one to check out! } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 {The modern Steinitz defence, according to Gameknot's database... } 5. d4 {...and now it's the Noah's Ark trap - pretty ironic that it aids Black when it is White who played the move to start it! This trap is sprung... } b5 {...first by driving back White's bishop... } 6. Bb3 Nxd4 {...then by exchanging on d4. } 7. Nxd4 exd4 {Should White take the pawn here? } 8. Bd5 {[8.Qxd4 is a blunder that allows the Noah's Ark trap: 8...c5 and ...c4 trapping the White bishop] (!) Nope - Hort doesn't fall for the trap and instead ensures the win of the pawn - Keres has to answer the threat to his rook. } Rb8 9. Bc6+ {Obviously, Hort reckons that his Bishop is a target so he aims to exchange it off. However, it looks like an extreme loss of tempo when a bishop that has already moved five times (soon six) has to be exchanged off for one that will only have moved once! White could still play 9.Qxd4 here, but would need to play a3 to have an escape hole for his bishop (9...Bd7 or 9...Ne7 and the Noah's Ark trap is renewed with c6, c5 and c4) } Bd7 10. Bxd7+ Qxd7 11. Qxd4 {Equalising in material - a centralised queen is great when it can't be driven back, but Keres could play c5 with tempo later if he wanted to.  } Nf6 12. O-O Be7 13. Nc3 {[White's centre is slightly weak and he can't stop Black's queenside expansion, so White is slightly worse already] - The development of both sides is nearing their ends, and Keres already has a plan queenside. Hort's counterplay will have to either come in the centre or kingside if he can't stop operations queenside. } O-O 14. a4 {Possibly hoping that Keres would exchange here, maybe? a3 was another move that could be played, but after 14...a5 the pawn will still reach the b4 square. In this position, b4 can easily be played... } Rfd8 {!? But Keres delays it, signalling a desire to open the d-file later on (he doesn't, by the way - he never needs to!) } 15. Qd3 {Why not axb5, I wonder? And on that note, why play this move? The purpose escapes me here... } b4 {The b4 push comes now, and Keres gains space queenside } 16. Nd5 {Hort relocates his knight to an aggressive square - with the pressure that is building up queenside, it won't do to be passive! } a5 {The b4 pawn didn't need protecting, but Keres had to play this straight away to stop White from playing a5 himself! } 17. b3 {Locking things up queenside. However, Keres still has the initiative, and uses it to improve the position of his bishop... } Nxd5 18. exd5 Bf6 {...like this; now it has control of the long dark-square diagonal with a gain of tempo as well! } 19. Rb1 c5 {! Keres continues his queenside attack with gusto; meanwhile, Hort doesn't really have a lot of targets to exploit. } 20. Bf4 {[if 20.dxc6 e.p. Qxc6, White's weakness at c2 is more significant than Black's at d6] - not only would c2 have been easier to attack, it is an important base pawn for White, whereas d6 would have been a weak isolated pawn } Be5 {!? Interesting; Keres offers the bishop exchange. This isn't a move that would leap out on you while analysing the position, but the point is that if Hort exchanges, the d-pawn, although passed, would prove to be a liability that needs protection. } 21. Be3 {Refusing the exchange. } Rbc8 {Consistent to Black's plan - his next move would be c4, and if White recaptures with the pawn (obviously not the queen; the point of Rbc8) Black simply takes on a4 to create two connected passed pawns. } 22. Qc4 {The only move which can stop this } Qf5 {Keres now targets the pawn at c2, which is defended for now... } 23. Qb5 {!? but Hort converts it to an exchange, hoping to quell Black's queenside pressure. } Qxc2 24. Qxa5 f5 {[The game is already strategically decided. White has no reasonable defence to ...f5-f4 and in some cases onwards to f3] - I wonder what f4 would achieve here, though - simply worsening the position of the bishop? } 25. f3 {If Black plays f4 now, then the White bishop has the f2 square to retreat to } Bb2 {! Cutting off access between the b1 rook and the b3 pawn - White has no way of saving it! } 26. Qa6 {Nothing much Hort can do, really, so he improves the position of his queen, while maintaining watch over the a4 pawn, which is now passed... } Qxb3 {...However, Keres now has two! Furthermore, Hort's bishop is under attack... } 27. Bf2 {There was an attractive counter-attack that Hort could have tried, but unfortunately it would not have worked out; 27.Bg5?! Rd7 28.Rf2, and it looks like the b2 bishop is won, but then Keres has the simple 28...h6! and the bishop can't stay on the c1-h6 diagonal to prevent Qe3 (If Bc1, then Qd1+, followed by Bd4+ wins) } c4 {You know what they say about passed pawns! } 28. Qb7 {White still looking for some sort of breakthrough with his queen - of course, because of the bishop on b2 the a4 pawn is immune. } Rcb8 {[Hereabouts Black starts to go astray. 28...Qa3 wins easily] - in other words, Keres should have been more focused on pusing his passed pawns than chasing Hort's queen around. } 29. Qa7 Rba8 30. Qb7 Rdb8 31. Qd7 Qc2 {After a bit of rook shuffling and queen chasing, Keres now prepares to advance his pawns, though perhaps Keene's earlier suggestion of Qa3 might have been better } 32. Qxd6 {Hort, meanwhile, creates a passed pawn of his own! } b3 33. Qe6+ Kh8 34. d6 {[White has real counterplay] - For example, one of Hort's plan for his pawn could be d7, followed by Rfe1 followed by Qe8+ could be worth a shot! } Bf6 {Keres retreats his bishop for defence... } 35. Rfc1 {...but allows this move from Hort! Now wherever the queen moves, the c4 pawn is ripe for the picking - has Keres lost his advantage? Well, first take a second look at the title of this annotation then work out the one move that doesn't lose the c4 pawn... :) } Qxc1+ {[A remarkable queen sacrifice] (!!) I'd call it more than remarkable myself! But then again, once you remember that quote that two connected, passed pawns on the sixth rank is more powerful than a rook, this move isn't that surprising! } 36. Rxc1 b2 {Keres advances with full steam, attacking the rook with tempo. } 37. Rb1 c3 {Now Keres threatens 38...c2! } 38. Qe2 Rxa4 {Now Keres threatens 39...Ra1! } 39. d7 {! The best chance for Hort at this point; if Keres played too quickly and tried Ra1 now, then Qe8+ steals the game! } h6 {! Forced, but powerful all the same - Keres eliminates his back rank weakness, and does so with the right pawn - 39...g6?? allows Hort to draw with 40.Qe6!! } 40. Qe8+ {Hort presses ahead regardless, still counting on Keres to slip up - 40...Rxe8?? 41.dxe8=Q+ Kh7 42.Qxa4 } Kh7 {No deal - with the attack that he has, Keres doesn't care about a lost rook... } 41. d8=Q {Still, Hort wants the one on a4, not the one on d8! } Rxd8 42. Qxa4 Rd2 {[Despite being a whole queen in arrears, Black is winning here] } 43. Rxb2 {[If 43.Qc4 c2 44.Qf1 Rd5 45.Be3 cxb1=Q 46.Qxb1 Ra5 47.Kf2 Kg8 and ...Ra1 winning] } cxb2 44. Qb3 {This move is forced, to prevent both pawn promotion and Rd1+ } Rd8 {The d1 square won't work, so Keres' rook moves on to a better square. Thank god for the bishop on f6 from Black's point of view! } 45. Qc2 {It won't be the c1 square... } Rb8 {Threatens b1=Q+ - but leaves the f5 pawn hanging! Hort can safely capture on f5 with check... } 46. Qb1 {...but Hort doesn't take it - Given his level of play, it's unlikely to be an oversight!  } g6 {Keres defends his pawn... but this may have been what Hort had wanted. Not that he had a winning advantage, just a last-ditch effort to secure the draw a bit later on... } 47. g4 {Attacks the pawn again, but also opens up an escape route for his king... } Ra8 {! In preparation for this move - now the only way to stop promotion is for Hort to sac his queen! } 48. Kg2 {Preventing the queen from being pinned } Ra1 49. Qc2 {Hort allows the re-arrival of the Black queen... } b1=Q 50. Qc7+ {...in return for one last attack, made possible by 46...g6. } Bg7 51. Bd4 {If Hort can withstand an attack from Black, then he steals the game... However, Keres has things under control. } Qf1+ 52. Kg3 f4+ {! A pawn sac to solidify Black's advantage - White has to take since Kh4 leads to mate after Qe1+ } 53. Kxf4 Qc1+ {The queen exchange is forced, and Hort resigned in a hopeless position - a spectacular game! }
