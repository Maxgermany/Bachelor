Bc4 {To make it more difficult for Black to play ...d6-d5} Bd7 {Black still wants to advance his d-pawn, but in the meantime he takes control of the b5-square in case it might be necessary to take on d5 with his c-pawn.} 15. Bb3 d5 {Black succeeds in carrying out his plan, but its outcome is unclear} 16. Qf2 {!  White  is maintaining the tension quite resourcefully.  16. exd5 Nfxd5= would be bland.} Rac8 {! Likewise resourceful, Black makes what Nimzovich termed a "mysterious rook move,"  transferring his rook to the potentially open file, thus making the capture of d5 less appetizing for White.  Moreover, the move is useful against White's coming attempt.} 17. Nde2 {! threatening 18. Bb6} c5 {!} 18. Bxd5 Nxc2 19. Bf4 Qb6 20. e5 {Otherwise, the weakness on d5 would have been balanced by a weakness of d4.} Nxd5 21. Nxd5 Qe6 22. Ndc3 Bc6 23. Rd2 Nd4 24. Nxd4 cxd4 25. Rxd4 Bxe5 26. Bxe5 Qxe5 27. Rfd1 Kg7 28.
