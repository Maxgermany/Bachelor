[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {Standard opening with the queen pawn.} c6 2. e4 {I intended to quickly explore the mid of the board with this move.} Nf6 3. Nc3 Qa5 {Here i was expecting the pawn to go for d5 so i didn't quite get this move} 4. Bd2 Qb6 {Looking for the weak pawn at b2.} 5. Bc4 {As i didn't see the threat at b2 i kept developing my game.} Qxb2 6. Bxf7+ {My point with this move was to draw out the enemy king since i felt that i had the chance to take advantage of that with the undeveloped game from the black side.} Kxf7 7. Nf3 h6 {This move didn't make much sense to me since it wouldn't help the development or the king defense at all.} 8. Ne5+ Ke8 9. Ng6 Rg8 10. e5 {With the goal of getting the knight out of f6.} Nd5 11. Nxd5 cxd5 12. O-O Nc6 13. Qh5 Kd8 14. f4 Qxd4+ {By this point i wasn't really worried with any pieces other than my knight my queen and his king so he just cleaned my side of the board as he pleased.} 15. Kh1 Qxd2 16. f5 Qxc2 17. e6 dxe6 18. fxe6 Bxe6 19. Nxf8 {Looking back i think that my opponent should have gone for Rxf8 and i probably wouldn't have the chance to win the game had he done that.} Kc7 20. Nxe6+ Kb6 21. Rab1+ {My pieces start closing in on the enemy king.} Ka6 22. Nc7+ Ka5 23. Qxd5+ {By this time his faith was decided so we just went through the formality of playing and eventually i won.} Ka4 24. Qb5+ Ka3 25. Rb3+ Kxa2 26. Qa4# {Even though we have both done a lot of mistakes i found this game really entertaining and i am really glad that at the end i come out as the winner.}
