1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian Defence.I must admit this came as a surprise to me as I expected my opponent to play the silicilian or ruy lopez} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 {Best move.This move follows all the opening principles} Qa5 {Qd6 is also ok} 4. Nf3 Bg4 {So far all my moves follow the opening principles while black has broken 2 (never develop queen too and develop knights before bishops)} 5. h3 {Trying 2 get black to trade his current best develop piece} Bh5 {If 5...Bxf3 6.Qxf3 white would be ahead in development} 6. b4 {The idea is to get black to make a mistake} Bxf3 {If 6...Qxb4 then 7.Rb1 Queen moves then I take on b7 } 7. Qxf3 Qe5+ 8. Be2 c6 9. O-O Nf6 {From here it can be seen that white has got the best out the opening in other words his got the winning game ,all I have to do now is place my pieces on better squares } 10. Rb1 e6 11. d4 {Offering another pawn for a strong attack with Rd1.} Qxd4 {11...Qc7 is better and safer} 12. Rd1 Qh4 {All my pieces are ready.It almost looks like white is in the middle game while black still in the opening} 13. Be3 Be7 {Better was 13..Nfd7 as this move doesn't lose a piece like Be7} 14. b5 {Much stronger was 14.Rd4 and after 14..Qh5 15.Qxh5 Nxh5 16.Bxh5 g6 17.Bf3 Bf6 white is clearly better as he is a piece } O-O 15. Rd4 Qh5 16. Qg3 {I think this was the best move to try an win the game as quick as possible because after my Queen gets to c7 I win start winning material} Qg6 17. Qc7 Bc5 18. Rg4 Nxg4 19. Bxc5 Qxc2 {Very weak.In these type of positions black must not go for pawns} 20. Bxf8 Qxc3 21. Bb4 Na6 {Trying to move the queen out the way lose to Qc8#} 22. bxa6 Qc2 23. Rd1 {Preparing to mate with Rd8+ } h5 24. axb7 Rf8 25. Bxf8 {Game over. As soon as I promote my b-pawn ,even if promote it to a knight I will still win easy} Qxe2 26. Rf1 {Black resigns as after I promote my b-pawn the game is over}
