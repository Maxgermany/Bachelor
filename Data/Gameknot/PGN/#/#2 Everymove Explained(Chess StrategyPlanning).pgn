1. e4 {Fights to control d5 square and f5 square} c5 {Sicilian defence a counter attacking defence. Pawn fights to control d4 and b4 while opening a diagonal for the queen} 2. Nf3 {Attacks center and develops kingside} Nc6 {Develops and puts more pressure on d4 square} 3. d4 {Challenges black pawn and knight and it is recomended that black takes d4 pawn before white plays d5} cxd4 {Opens c-file and trades c-pawn for a center d-pawn. This c-file is important latter on for blacks strategy which usually involves the control of the c-file with rooks and queen} 4. Nxd4 {White move knight again but move is still good because the knight is now in the center attacking lots of squares which could be useful latter } Nf6 {Develops,attacks and gets more control over d5 square } 5. Nc3 {Best move(develops and attacks d5 square and defends e4 pawn) other move of not bad but not close to as good as Nc3} d6 {Pawn gets control over e5 square and opens diagonal for bishop. Other move such as g6 and e6 are also good} 6. Bc4 {Places bishop on dangerous diagonal that attacks f7 pawn which is only defended by the king} g6 {Black plans to control the darck squares e5 d4 with his d-pawn,dark bishop and C6 knight} 7. Nxc6 {Best move because it weakends black's control over dark squares and gives white attacking tactical chances} bxc6 {Only move and opens b-file which black should place one of his rooks latter in the game} 8. e5 {Fischer trys to weakend blacks pawn structure and wants his opponent to move his knight twice in the opening} dxe5 {Worst move black should have played Ng4 or Nd7 or d5 } 9. Bxf7+ {Drags king away from queen and therefore black resigns} Kxf7 {Only move } 10. Qxd8 {Winning queen for bishop }
