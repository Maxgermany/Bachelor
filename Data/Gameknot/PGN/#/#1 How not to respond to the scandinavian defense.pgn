1. e4 d5 {My classical Scandinavian defence, I like this one, because there's few theory involved. So I most often start by taking white out of their comfort zone. } 2. Nc3 {This one however, I think doesn't even gets mentioned in theory. I think it to be one of the weaker replies as I get the center with d4 and white gets a bit cramped after Ne2.} d4 3. Nd5 {but he chooses to play Nd5. This allows me to get my strong center with tempo and an even more cramped position for white.} e6 4. Nf4 {this is his only move} e5 {et voila, my center is there. Now white's got 5 options. Nd5 loses the knight after c7 (4. Nf4 was his only option, but now f4 is also blocked by the e5 pawn), Nh3 seems useless since Ng5 gets countered by f6 and I complete a strong pawn chain in the center. (my knight doesn't have to go to f6, Ne7-g6 seems ok as well) Nh5 might be considered, for it can then go to g3 and it might be able to use the f5 square. But well, that's 3 tempo's later. Ne2 seems the most logical move, but then, why make the Nd5-f4-e2 jump if you could've just played 3. Ne7. My opponent chose for 5.Nd3} 5. Nd3 {This has the merit of being able to attack the e5 pawn twice with his Knights after Nf3, but I can just play f6 or put two defenders on the e5 pawn, Nc6, Bd6, Qe7 are all acceptable candidates. The big disadvantage is that it cramps white big time. The d-pawn can't move, so the DSB isn't going anywhere (b3-Bb2 just stares down a pawn chain). I'm incline to think he'll have to play f4 in this position before bringing his other knight out. I think black is at least equal here.} Nc6 {The most logical defense move.} 6. Nf3 {No 6.f4, but 6.Nf3. Now white is completely cramped, Be2, O-O and then what? White has no space and black can freely develop. Black certainly seems better.} Bd6 {I played Bd6, because I didn't know yet where I wanted my queen, and I don't like moving my queen twice over the same diagonal (it'll surely go to f6-g5 or h4), and I also want to keep Ne7-g6 open, without blocking my DSB. This however seems to give me a little problem later, because my queen is cut off from the d4 pawn.} 7. Be2 {and with this move I noticed that after Nf6, the e4-pawn is not defendable, so I just went to grab that one. } Nf6 8. O-O {Here I had to watch out for jokes with Re1 after 8.... Nxe4, but I can defend everything, and I don't think 10. Bf1 would do any good.} Nxe4 {And so I went ahead and grabbed that free pawn.} 9. c3 {Here I actually wanted to be able to play Ne7 followed by cxd4 exd4 and than I'd be able to play c5. But since my knight is the only other defender of d4 (as I mentioned my queen is blocked off) it's not playable. } b6 {So I went for b6 with the idea of Bb7 or Ba6 which would put my bisschop in a great diagonal for attacking his king. Certainly after the cxd, exd exchange, my DSB is also pointing beautifully towards the h2 square.} 10. cxd4 exd4 11. Nfe1 {I don't get this move, relocating to c2? to g2 after g3?, freeing up the LSB? Where would the LSB go? Bf3 seems the only logical square, but it gets countered by f5 and if Bxe4, fxe4, I have an amazing center and the bisschop pair, so that wouldn't be good and he'd have to find a square for his d3-knight to be able to play d3 and exploit the pin on my e4-knight. Plus the f1-knight really would have to go to c2. But well, then there's the question: what else can he play? I don't see any decent moves...} Qh4 {asking for g3, which would weaken his light squares around his king dramatically.} 12. g3 {I'm still wondering what the best move would've been, g3 or Nf3, moving the knight back and losing a tempo.} Qh6 {I wanted to stay on the h-file. Even with the probable threat of d3 after the d3-knight moves.} 13. Ng2 {and so it gets relocated to the amazing g2-square (spot the sarcasm :) ) However it can go to f4 covered by the d3-knight.} Bb7 {finally taking advantage of the beautiful diagonal. I though he'd play Bf3 at this moment, challenging the diagonal, but he goes for the queen threat instead.} 14. Ndf4 {beautiful square for the knight.} O-O {I don't see any trouble, so I decide I've got the time to castle.} 15. d3 {chasing the knight and getting ready for a discovered attack, but what use is their to a discovered attack if there's no decent second target?} Nc5 {hitting the weak d3 pawn. (Nf6-g4 would be a strong mate threat, but the LSB-Q battery will prevent it for a long time)} 16. Nh5 {Nh5 targets g7, but without any help it won't do much. he will however chase my queen around a bit and untangle himself a bit.} Qg6 {Qe6 would've also bumped into Ngf4} 17. Ngf4 Qf5 18. g4 {This indeed chases my queen away again, but it's still a threat on d7, but this weakens his kingside even more.} Qd7 19. Nxg7 {another move that deserves a '?' . If anyone finds a variation that I might have went into that would win him his material back, please let me know, I don't see any.} Kxg7 20. Nh5+ {ok, check, but what else?} Kh8 {preparing Rg8 battering up on g4} 21. Qd2 {probably with the idea of Qh6 threatening mate of g7, but Rg8 stops this immediately I think?} Rfg8 22. Nf6 {true, a fork, but I've got another useless rook on a8 and I've got a piece already, so I'll still be at a material advantage and he'll have almost no pieces around his king.} Qe6 23. Nxg8 Rxg8 {Rxg4 seems very dangerous!} 24. h3 {yea, it's covered, but f5 just renews the threat and his kingside is again, weakened...} f5 25. Kh1 {walking in the diagonal of my LSB? ok, relieving the pin of g4 but I was going to take that either way, so that didn't do much.} fxg4 26. Bxg4 Rxg4 27. hxg4 Qxg4 {the threat is Qh3+ Kg1 Qh2 checkmate, I know, Obvious, but what to do about it. I think f3 is his only option. blocking my bischops diagonal and allowing his queen to cover h2. But what about 28.f3 Ne5 (or Nb6, but Ne5 attacks f3 again), his DSB and a1-rook are just out of the game.} 28. Qg5 {but this just goes into the 'Obvious' mate in 2 line.} Qh3+ 29. Kg1 Qh2# {Thanks for reading, this was the tutorial on how to not respond to the Scandinavian ;)}
