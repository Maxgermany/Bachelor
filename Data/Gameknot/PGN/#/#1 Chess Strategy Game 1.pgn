1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 b6 {Very bad move ,better was e5 } 3. e5 Ng8 4. Bc4 e6 5. Nf3 d5 6. exd6 e.p. {From here my strategy was to use control the half-open e-file for a attack } Bxd6 7. d4 Bb7 8. O-O {D5 here was better as I lead in development so therfore I must try to open up the game} Bb4 {Bad to move same piece twice because it only wastes time better was Nf6 or Ne7} 9. Re1 {D5 again was better because if the e-file opens I would simply just dominate the game} Bxf3 10. Qxf3 {Black last move loses the game immediatly} c6 11. d5 Bxc3 12. bxc3 cxd5 13. Bxd5 Nc6 {Black can't play Qxd5 as I would just play Qxd5} 14. Bxc6+ Ke7 15. Ba3+ {Black resigns as mate will soon follow with 15...Qd6 16.Bxd6+ Kxd6 17.Rad1+ Kc7 18.Bxa8 b5 19.Qb7#. This is just warm up annotation,latter I will go in great detail on strategy}
