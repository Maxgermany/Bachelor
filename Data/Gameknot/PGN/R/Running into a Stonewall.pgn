[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {More common is 1.e4 } d5 {Black replies symetrically also staking a claim for the centre.} 2. e3 {?! From a theoretical point of view, White's last move has certain advanatges and disadvantages. I think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Now white can develop his King's Bishop. Thi is a big factor in this game as this bishop plays a large role in whites coming attacking plans. This move however blocks the development of whites queen bishop. This is the "Stonwall's Bad Bishop" Incidently in reaching the desired pawn pattern, it is essential for white to play his moves in the proper sequence, as indicated in this game. This has now become harder for white and has now seen the 'Stonewall attack' see little action even in club or internet games, let alone master games!} Nf6 {This is a standard developing move which has the merit of controlling e4  and also prepares for castling. The alternative move here is 2..Bf5 which also controls e4 but leads to a totally different pattern.} 3. Bd3 {This is one of whites key moves in his desired opening pattern. This move develops a move prepares for castling, sets the bishop up on a strong attacking diagonal aiming at blacks prospective castled position, and disputes control of the e4. As we shall see from whites next move it is of utmost importance for him to have the the d4square in his power.} e6 {Black follows suit, preparing to develop his King Bishop.} 4. Nd2 {! White intends to play f4 one of the characteristic moves of the 'Stonewall' pattern. once he has played that move black can play ...Ne4 with out inccuring any danger of having it driven it away by f3. therefore before playing f4, white first plays out his Queen Knight to prevent  ..Ne4. I decided to give this move a ! becuase it is a clever thinking ahead move.} c5 {This is a good move theoretically as it engages whites d4 pawn and therefore minimizes somewhat, white's pressure on e4. White can't reply with 5. dxc5 as that would relax his grip on the valuable square e4. In this opening control of the centre is absolutely paramount. Now there is a threatof ...c4, driving White's Bishop off the powerful attacking diagonal.} 5. c3 {This is another characteristic move of the stonewall pattern. White supports d4 and also creates a retreat for the Bishop along the powerful attacking diagonal in the event of the move i talked about earlier ...c4.} Nc6 {This is another useful develping move, Black threatens, if permitted, to play ..e5with complete freedomand the intiative. In this we encounter a sharp tempo in the struggle for control of the centre. Where black develops systematically, there is a tense fight for the control of centre from the very beginning. At this point the fight for the centre must absorb both of the players thoughts. One negligent move could give the other player the intiative. In the event of 5...c4, trying to drive whites light squared bishop of that powerful attacking diagonal, white will not oblige by reacting passively with 6.Be2, when the bishop is left out of the attack with no aggressive prospects, Instead white will play 6. Bc2! so that his Bishop exerpts precisely the same aggressive effect as from d3.} 6. f4 {?! This move completes the stonewall pattern, ..e5 is permanently prevented, and white prepares to anchor his King Knight at the powerful outpost on e5. Here the Knight wil exert commanding influence on the enemys' terrain. The idea behind the 'Stonewall' is to keep the centre blocked and launch an attack on the wing. As you can see it is a fairly rigid pawn formation which can often leave little room for the pieces to operate. The e5 square is whites only central invasion point. This opening 'system' ( I say system because it can be played by both sides) is more popular with inexperienced players becasue they can be fairly certain that they're moving their pieces to their proper squares.  I think this is the wrong way to learn chess as it does not teach you to think. I think you should learn more flexible opening.} Be7 {This deve;ops a piece and prepares castling. This is slightly passive I would recomend 6...Bd6 with no attacking prospects but being able to defend or exchange the oncoming White Knight to e5. Now you will se how the stonewall pattern got its name!} 7. Ngf3 {The knight starts its journey to the formidable outpost of e5. } O-O {Black thinks he is getting his king into safety where he can then hope to develop his pieces and eventually attack whites formidable pawn formation. You will see this is the wrong choice because black has actually castled on the wing where all the action is going to take place. I think it would be a better plan for black to continue developing is pieces and castle queenside then pawnstorm the kingside .} 8. Ne5 {White has now achieved his opening objectives: he has set up the 'Stonewall' formation, which gives him a firm grip on the centre; he has posted his King bishop at d3 with strong attacking prospects; he has brought his King Knight to e5, emphasising his strong grip on the centreand his aggressive intentions towards Black's King. } Qc7 {Black intends to fianchetto his Queen Bishop before he can do this, however,he must give his Queen knight additional protection. Once Black's Queen Bishop is developed, he can start thinking of finding the most favourable squares for the placement of his rooks. We cn now ask ourselves the question; What is White's plan in the middlegame? This requires a careful assesment of the position. Material is even in. In development Black seems to have a slight advantage; he has castled, moved his queen and is on the point of developing his Queen Bishop. White lags in most of these details. However White as you will see make up for his la in development. I conlude that white has better prospects. WHY? Whereas Black has not posted one man beyond the fifth rank, White's King Knight is powerfully placed at e5 well supported by two pawns. This factor alone is enough to outweigh any element which is at the moment in Black's favour. But there is another poin: Whites Bishop at d3 is aimed directly at Black's castled position. Black can't block the attacking diagonal by ...Ne4. Therefore Whites basic plan us to aim for attack. } 9. O-O {While automatically bringing his king to safety, white enhances the force of the coming attack by bringing his King Rook into action. You may say that castling the same side that you prepare to pawnstorm is quite risky.hoever if white takes time to develop his Queenside pieces then castle Queenside then pawnstorm the Kingside Black will already of organized his forces to defend his King and may well be in the midst of attacking White's King!} b6 {White has some alternatives wich are not satisfactory. If 9...cxd4 then 10. exc4 opening the diagonal for white's Queen Bishop, which can then move  as soon as the Knight on d2 has moved. Another point in White's favour is the opening of the e-file for his Rooks. As the move 9...cxd4 gives Black no compensation advantage, the move must therefore be out of the question. Secondly if 9...c4 as has already been pointed out the bishop can just retreat to c2 remaining on the powerful attacking diagonal, still aimed at Black's castled King! Also Whites grip on the centre is extremely strong and he surely will benefit from black stopping the posibility of exchanging pawns in the centre or maintaining the tension. Thirdly is 9...NxN then 10.fxe5. At first sight you can be forgiven for thinking this idea is attractive, as it rids Black of a piece which is bound to be a thorn in his side. But the answer is still negative. After 9...NxN 10.fxe5, with the result that the f-file is opened for white. The power of Whites King Rook would be enhanced x1000, another equally convincing arguement that after 9...NxN 10.fxe5 Black's valuable protective Knight is driven away from f6. The result is the attack by White's d3 Bishop on h7 becomes more and more powerful! I think that arguement just about rules out any other move, no? } 10. g4 {Whites violent pawn thrust is made with a few objectives in mind. His basic idea is obviously to drive away Black's Knight on f6 from its key defencive post. Thereby building pressure on h7. Another reason for this move is after the pawn advance g4-g5 there are often the opportunities to exchange it. Pawn advances result in open lines. In this case this exchange of the pawn would give White the new line of attack the open g-file.} Bb7 {Now Black actually threatens to play 11...NxN. But isn't this strange. A moment ago I said that 9...NxN would be bad. Now I claim that this this move would be good. What has happened to change my mind. The point is thi8s: After 11...NxN; 12.fxe5 Black would be able (after10...Bb7) to play 12...Ne4! establishing and maintaining an outpost os his own. whites attacking plans would be permanently disrupted as the attacking diagonal of his Bishop at d3 would be completely neutralized. N.B- Black's hope of killing the attack is contingent withon getting the upperhand in the centre (12...Ne4); and this in turn is the result of 10...Bb7, a move which exerts pressureon the centre. And so, it is a struggle for control of the centre which determines the success or failure of the attack!} 11. Qf3 {! Now Black's threat of ...NxN fades into an oblivion, as White's Queen move has re-established his control of the centre and has consequently assured the continued progress of his attack. If 11...NxN; 12.fxe5 Ne4?(note how in my last comment this move was given !); 13.NxN dxe4 and Black has lost a valuable Pawn without compensation.} a6 {?! This is a strange yet curious move, how does 11...a6 enhance Black's prospects? Is Black just marking time? Is he waiting to see how White's plan unfolds? I think there is some reason behind blacks last move: The Kingside isabout as well-defended as it can be, and a regrouping of his forceswould not improve his defenceve positon. Black therefore prepares a Queenside counter-attack. I think he plans to advance his Queenside pawns in the hope of opening a file in that sector and in that way diverting Whites attenton from the Kingside. This plan seems logical, although theoretically the plan is harmless for White. For on the Kingside White attacks the Black king yet on the Queenside Black pursuesa purely positional objective, which can't harm White's King. In fact, White's attention now becomes so pressing that Black never gets any further with this intended pawn storm!} 12. g5 {White decides this is the moment to inleash his violent bloodthirsty attack, in doing this driving off the knight.} Ne8 {After 12...Nd7 the game would take a similiar course. White can now continue with 13. Qh5 or 13.Qh3threatening mate and thereby provoking a weakening pawn advance in front of the balc king.I the long run this would probably result in a winning position for white. but as it happensWhite has a more forceful and more enteratining way of penetrating immediately and smashing up the position of Black's King. Try and work out what.} 13. Bxh7+ {!!! Did you get it. If you did you're a better player than me becasue I didn't see it first time. This entertaining sacrifice is the logical outcome of the Bishop's manacing position on the diagonal. Black's castled positionnow becomes so vulnerable that his knig is exposed to a mating attack.} Kxh7 {13...Kh8 is even worse, because of 14. Qh5 threatening 15.Bg6  discovered check and 15. Qh7 Checkmate!} 14. Qh5+ {Naturally.} Kg8 {Forced} 15. Rf3 {Note how White's forces are taking up the posts invisaged by Horowitz's initial attacking plan. Now his idea is 16.Rh3 threatening 17.Qh7checkmate.} g6 {This holds out longer than the alternative of 15.f6} 16. Qh6 {Still threatening 16.Rh3 17.Qh7checkmate.} Ng7 {Valiantly trying to shield king.} 17. Rh3 Nh5 {Now Black's intentions become clear. His Knight blocks the all important h-file, preventing the executionof White's mating threat.White is a piece behind, Horowitz starts feeling queezy he cannot afford to let up his pressure now or 'He's doomed doomed i tells yer!'} 18. Nxg6 {! This great move breaks Black's position wide open. The availability of the Knight for the sacrifice is a tribute to this piece dominating the e5 square. The threat now is 19. Qh8 CHECKMATE.  Black is left with no choice...} fxg6 {...Forced} 19. Qxg6+ {This move unhinges the support of Black's Knight ON h5. Black must do something because if 19...Kh8?? then 20. RxN checkmate.} Ng7 {Now white is two pieces down. Is he digging himself into a hole deeper and deeper or can he continue the attack?} 20. Rh7 {Threatens 21.QxN mate} Bd6 {This allows the Black Queen to guard mate along the 7th rank. This is forced.} 21. Qh6 {With Black's position absolutely destroyed, White has no trouble thinking up ways of prolonging the attack.} Bxf4 {Pinning the g5 pawn.an therefore preventing g5-g6.} 22. exf4 {Now the threat of g5-g6 has to be met again. } Rxf4 23. g6 Rg4+ 24. Kh1 {24.Kf1 is a mistake for then 24...Qf4  forcing the exchange of Queens easing the tension for Black. As he is still a piece ahead, the exchange of Queens would win for him.} Rxg6 {Black returns the rest of the material but he hasbn't really a choice. In games like this it is extremely depressing for Black to have a position like this where he is constantly on the defencive;his king has no refuge; new threats are abundant. I should know at my level I am often in this type of position when I play better players.} 25. Qxg6 {White is now the exchange ahead and his pressure remains unabatedIn one sense, it is even stronger than previously, now that White's Bishop is ready to take a hand in precedings.} Rf8 {This is to prevent 26. Nf3} 26. Nf3 {! There are other winning methods but who really gives a **** about them. Horowitz certainly didn't and this is definately the most entertaining way the game could end from here on.} Rxf3 27. Bh6 {This sets up a deadly pin. He threatens mate beginning with 28.RxN } Rf7 {This is the only defence. But now White strengthens the pin.} 28. Rg1 {1-0 Black resigns and you can see why. This is a really instructive game. To summarise: White followed out his plan of attack consistently. He setb up his pieceswith a view to a direct attack on the Black King, particularly on h7. First driving away Blacks Guardian Knight on f6, he concentrated his forces against the Black King, sacrificing brilliantly in justifiable reliance on his ultimate success. An interesting feature of the unfolding of White's attack is the way his bottled up dark squared Bishop at last came to life and hammered out the final decision againtst Black's harried King.
