1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {And away we go! :)} Bc5 {After a bit of discussion, Joe informed me that Bc5 was one of Jack's most popular replies. Since this exercise, in part, is about getting Joe to beat that darn Jack and also, if Jack chooses it, it must be a halfway decent move, especially in the opening, it makes sense for good ol Tips to choose options Jack would likely go with. Hence 3. Bc5. (Incidentally, though I wouldn't be so foolish as to let an opponent play the R-L, if I had to, I'd probably go with 3....Nf6 for the Berlin Defence methinks. I know Janet certainly rates the Berlin! } 4. Nc3 Nf6 {Four knightsish. } 5. d3 d6 6. Bg5 O-O {Castling completes development here. } 7. O-O {Likewise. Does White not look much better with the 7 O-O and all four of its officers developed than the limp 4 or 5 O-O castling variants? } h6 {Time for black to either push back these greedy space-grabbing, knight pinning (well one of them is), bishop errants (does that make them Crusaders?) or force them off the board! } 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 {White keeps its powder dry and stretches Black's fortress} Nd4 10. Nxd4 exd4 {About even though the doubled pawns along the central d file may turn into a weapon in the endgame....but who will be the one wielding it?} 11. Nd5 {Better than retreat for White's knight I reckon. Black accepts the exchange to get the Q off her royal arse. } c6 12. Nxf6+ Qxf6 13. Bc4 {Now the second bishop is in retreat. Even position though White is being perhaps a little passive now, Black seems to be making all the running. Though the process of aggression is causing Black's pawns to become either cramped....or coiled.} b5 14. Bb3 a5 {Clearly, now Black can uncoil as it chases after the lcb} 15. a4 {Careful with that move Joe! The a pawn could become isolated or the a rook could wind up having to nursemaid a pawn instead of getting in the game. } Be6 {Of course it's not all going Black's way either. Qh5 at any time in the immediate future could prove to become a thorn in Black's endgame plans. If they want to push up the queenside, they don't want their own king being harried all the way on the other side of the board. This distracts White, offering an out for the White lcb that seems stuck out in front of its own pawns. } 16. Bxe6 {White takes it. But in the process, Black's Queen creeps closer to the very centre of the board. White may have been better with 16. c4, opening up an avenue of retreat for the lcb and eventually allowing it to get either in front or behind the Q on the h5-d1 diagonal. One more supporting piece for that a4 pawn has also been removed, moving White closer to feeling pressured into axb5 and the generation of a dangerous passed pawn on the a file for Black. A very, very, minor positional win here, then, for Black, perhaps, but, in the spirit of Euwe's little threats, Black is building tiny threats and also shutting down White's potential to do the same. } Qxe6 17. axb5 cxb5 {The a pawn is now passed and the rook pushed into, instead of nursemaiding it's own a pawn, acting as sentinel against Black's. A rather expensive role for a rook. } 18. c3 a4 {Tempts b3 at which point Black would decline and go one further up the a file. } 19. Rb1 {??? White perhaps decides that it will babysit the b pawn instead and let the b pawn in turn stand sentry over the a3 square. Or, perhaps White wants to tempt Black into exchanging the a pawn, with 19....a3 20 bxa3 Rxa3 giving Black a rook on the 3rd rank, yet tossing in it's valuable passed a pawn in the process.    Instead, Black can simply take c3 and generate a pair of connected passed pawns in the exchange. Though on this occasion, that would give the White rook a bead on the b pawn. White might also be trying to load up Q and rook on the b file: placing tanks solidly in the way of the Black's planned infantry charge up the queenside flank.   White, then, seems congnisant of Black's gameplan and is responding accordingly. Of course, under Euwe's theory of the middlegame, naturally one's opponent responds to the first, second, third little threat. But as they keep responding they are not generating any threats of their own and must, eventually, be overwhelmed. The next few moves will prove telling. } dxc3 {Here I decide to see how Joe will deal with a mating net revolving, in part, around saccing the b pawn. As mentioned earlier, White may have decided to move Rb1 in order to get a bead on the b pawn. Black is going to hand White that pawn and in the process turn up the pressure on the a1 square, possibly even saccing it's Q depending on the line. If White falters (example line with the Q sac 20.	bxc3	a3 21.	Rxb5	a2 22.	Qa1	Rfb8 23.	Rb2	Rxb2 24.	Qxb2	Qb3 25.	Qxb3	a1=Q 26.	Rxa1	Rxa1+ 27.	Qb1	Rxb1# )   The purpose here is less about winning the game (in that case I would probably choose the strategy of keeping the b and a pawns connected and effect their movement up the qside with solid tactical play) and more about setting a puzzle. The initial purpose of this game: to demonstrate the virtues of castling to complete development rather than as part of development in the R-L has been achieved. Joe acknowledges the possibilities and will keep it as a tool in his belt to be used if and when he sees fit.   Now, in his games I've noticed that he can be occasionally king-hit in middle games by a tempting exchange or even seeming error by the opponent, only to find himself suddenly losing a major piece or worse due to a lack of simple tactical calculation, being too concerned with strategic concerns or what happened in a GM game from a similar position. What he fails to realise is that high level players won't bother with cheap tricks (like constructing a mating net with plenty big holes in it but with a nice, juicy, morsel as the bait) against high level players since they know their opponent won't fall for such nonsense. Against poor Joe, though, players of all abilities have no such scruples! ;)   } 20. bxc3 a3 21. Ra1 {Ha! Joe passes up the tempting morsel on b5 to block off the impending threat down the a file. Bravo!} Bd4 {Black continues to toss up temptation, here Black is hoping to remove the sentinel c pawn so that it can once again connect a and b pawns as it furthers its attack up the queenside.   Now, this problem is double-pronged. Joe is clever enough to see my intention but, 21...c4 sacs the rook. Qc4 is lead move but 22 b4 asks further questions. Pressure is ramping queenside in a dashing but, ultimately, flawed fashion. There are devastating outs for Black. Can you spot them? } 22. Qb1 Bxc3 {White, I think, missed a golden opportunity in declining what I'm beginning to think was a dubious sac by Black. Lucky me, Joe declines and now his qside corner is pressured further } 23. Ra2 {Upon further analysis, I think the sac was as scary as I thought originally. But no less scary than White's position now. Black has built up pressure on the Qside to breaking point and now White has no good moves left. } b4 24. Re2 a2 {All over red rover. With nothing left to learn, Black resigns. A good game by Joe and it does highlight how a later R-L castling can give White more options in the middle, though not all of those options are good! }
