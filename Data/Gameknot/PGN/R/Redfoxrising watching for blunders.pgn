1. b4 {After playing this person and losing to my own blunder, I was not going to let that happen in this game. He opened with b4 and I figured he was going Bb2 next.} e5 {I'm playing Black and open with e5} 2. b5 {He pushes his pawn to b5 and I ask if he is trying to promote his b pawn?} Bc5 {I am able to develop my DSB to c5.} 3. e3 {This opens his LSB  to look down diagonal protecting his hanging pawn on b5.  and his Queen to look down the other diagonal. } Nf6 {I develop my Knight with plans to get my King to safety} 4. a4 {He brings out his wing pawn which does not control the center.} d5 {I take advantage of the open center and now my LSB has a view of the h3 diagonal.} 5. d4 {He decides to defend the center threatening my DSB. } exd4 {Pawn takes pawn, this doubles my pawns on the d-file for now. } 6. exd4 {He takes back my pawn again attacking my DSB.} Bd6 {I drop by DSB back and am now looking at his d2 pawn.} 7. Be2 {He decides to develop his LSB in front of his King, this leave just his knight on his King-side to be develop.} O-O {I decide to Castle Kingside to get my King to safety.} 8. Nf3 {He develops Nf3 which completes King-side development.} a6 {I want to develop my Knight on my Queen-side but his b5 pawn has been in the way so I simply play a6 to see what he decides to do about my attacking pawn.} 9. O-O {He ignores my attack of his b5 pawn and instead castles King-side.} axb5 {I take his b-pawn and also open up my Rook to get in the game.} 10. Bxb5 {Bishop takes and again my knight can not develop to c6. } Ne4 {This move is normally saved until I develop my minor pieces, but e4 was open and I wanted my Knight there now. There were no attackers and I had my d pawn watching my back.} 11. c3 Nc6 {enough is enough I bring out my Knight to Nc6.} 12. h3 {He plays h3, I think it weakens his King-side.} Re8 {I play Re8 to look down the e-file for a x-ray attack  } 13. Bg5 {? LSB attacks my Queen  Better would of been Nfd2} Nxg5 {I take the LSB with my Knight.} 14. Nbd2 {He develops his other Knight in front of his Queen.} Nxh3+ {I get in the first check of the game with my move of Nxh3+} 15. gxh3 {Pawn takes my Knight.} Bxh3 {I retake with Bxh3 wondering how I can get to a quick mate.} 16. Re1 {He moves Re1 attacking my rook.} Qf6 {I finish my development and bring my Queen out to f6 as the other 2 black squares are protected by his Knight on f3.} 17. Bd3 {? He maneuvers  his LSB back to d3. I thought he might have brought it back to f1.} Qh6 {I can't check on g6 so I move to Qh6} 18. Qc2 {?He aligns his Queen behind the same diagonal  as his LSB. Rook b1 was his best move, althought the move made did connect his Rooks.} Qh5 {My decision to move my Queen like a pawn is due to the Knight on f3 protecting the array of dark-squares. and the LSB backed up by his Queen.} 19. Bxh7+ {? Bx7+ looks good but best move would have been to attack my DSB moving back to Bf1 } Kh8 {I had to decide to move here to h8 or f8. I would lose my tempo and trade off Queens if I chose to take with my Queen.} 20. Bf5 {He moved Bf5} Bxf5 {Bishop takes Bishop} 21. Rxe8+ {? Rxe8+   this is useless as I will just take back best move was Qc1.} Rxe8 {Rook takes Rook} 22. Qd1 {?He has to move his Queen from attack of my LSB so he thought actually taking Qxf5 was best move as his Queen and Rook watched rest of the game.} Qg4+ {Qg4+} 23. Kh1 {He plays Kh1} Qh3+ {Qh3+ I check and think about my plan to mate, I thought I might eventually swap Queens if not careful.} 24. Kg1 {Kg1 is forced, again I cant play my Queen to a dark square so I} Re6 {Have to bring up my Rook for help} 25. Nf1 {Nf1 is played and He is going to have good defense with his 2 Knights. His Queen and his Rook will have to just sit and watch our game } Rg6+ {Rg6+} 26. Ng3 {Ng3 is forced} Bxg3 {I take Bxg3} 27. fxg3 Rxg3+ 28. Kf2 {Kf2 is forced} Rg2+ {Rg2+} 29.
