1. e4 {I am White in this game against some Russian dude I played in Reno.} c5 2. c3 {The Alapin Variation, I plan to take control of the centre with d4.} Nc6 {The most popular choices for Black's 2nd move are Nf6 and d5. Less popular, but equally playable are Nc6, d6, e6, and Qc7.} 3. d4 {I take control of the centre.} cxd4 4. cxd4 d5 {The text move, and Nf6 are the only ways Black can keep equality. Other less agressive moves will leave me with a small advantage due to my strong centre.} 5. exd5 {5. e5 isn't a good choice for me because after Black brings out his queen's bishop and plays e6, the game will transpose into a French game, (e4 e6 d4 d5 e5 c5) but where Black's bishop isn't sitting passively on c8 blocked by the pawn on e6.} Qxd5 {Here I have an isolated d-pawn, which can be a weakness, but can also be a strength because it's controlling the centre, unlike any of Black's pawns.} 6. Nf3 {Be3 is less accurate because it doesn't help me clear the way for castling kingside, and the bishop would also be passive, unlike the knight which also adds control of the central e5 square.} e6 {6...Bg4 is better because it actively places Black's bishop, unlike now where it is blocked.} 7. Nc3 {Tempo.} Qd8 {7...Bb4 is worse, because even though it develops a piece instead of retreating one, I can simply play Bd3 and O-O, then the queen will have to retreat anyway, leaving the bishop on an unimportant square, because ...Bxc3 bxc3 strengthens my centre.} 8. Bd3 {Black must be careful not to fall for my cheap trick of 8...Nxd4? 9. Nxd4 Qxd4?? 10. Bb5 , winning Black's queen.} Be7 {A simple developing move.} 9. O-O {I am ahead in development because Black had to move his queen twice while I developed my knight a couple moves back.} Nf6 10. Bg5 {The most active place for my bishop.} a6 {Black can play h6 and g5, but it weakens his position and it places my bishop on the more tempologically correct g3-square.} 11. Qe2 {A risky move. I decided to sacrifice my isolated pawn to add to my slight lead in development.} Nxd4 12. Nxd4 Qxd4 13. Rad1 {Now Black's queen has to move once again, because of all my tactical threats along the d-file.} Qc5 {This is the move that lets me gain the least amount of tempi.} 14. Be3 Qh5 {Black's only hope of stopping my tempo gains is to trade queens.} 15. Qxh5 {Declining the queen trade offer takes away my initiative. Whenever you have the initiative, especially when you're down material, every move you make should be a tactical threat, or moves that stop your opponent's counterplay.} Nxh5 16. Na4 {A miniature tactic to take one of Black's bishops, leaving me with the strong bishop pair. Black cannot stop Nb6.} Bd7 17. Nb6 Rd8 18. Nxd7 Rxd7 19. Be4 {Now that I have the strong bishop pair, I can place them actively in the centre where they control both sides of the board.} Bd6 {Stops Rxd7 Kxd7 Bxb7} 20. Rd2 {Preparing to double my rooks on the wide open d-file.} f5 21. Bf3 Nf6 22. Rfd1 {Now if Black's bishop moves, I still have the tactical threat of Rxd7 Nxd7 Bxb7.} Ke7 23. Rd2xd6 {More tactics come into play. } Rxd6 24. Bc5 {If I can get the rook for free, then I will be up a piece in the endgame, my strong 2 bishops against Black's defensive 1 knight.} Nd5 {Rd8 was the other move that defends the rook, but it allows me to trade rooks and get my pawn back with Bxb7, giving me a good bishop vs. knight endgame, where my bishop is stronger because there are pawns on both sides of the board, and his knight is too slow to jump across the board.} 25. Bxd5 exd5 26. Rxd5 Rhd8 {I must be careful not to play the losing Rxf5?? because Ke6 relieves the pin on Black's rook, while attacking my rook, and I don't have time to get my rook back and defend my own rook, so the endgame will be left with his strong mobile rook against my weaker bishop.} 27. f4 {I prepare to bring my king to the centre for the ensuing endgame.} Ke6 28. Re5+ {Trading rooks is bad because after all the pieces are gone, Black's king will be closer to the centre in the pure pawn endgame.} Kf6 29. Bxd6 Rxd6 30. Re2 {Now I've reached a rook endgame, which seems rather drawish. I play Re2 to stop Black's rook from coming to d2, where my queenside pawns are likely to die.} Rd4 {My opponent offered me a draw here. I believe that this position is a theoretical draw, but I think I have slightly better winning chances because of my control of the e-file, stopping Black's king from coming into play. And my coach also taught me a lot rook endgame strategies.} 31. g3 h6 {Black cannot stop my control of the e-file with Re4, because it isolates his pawn, and isolated pawns can be very weak in endgames, especially pure pawn endgames.} 32. Kf2 {I'm getting my king to the centre.} g5 33. Ke3 {I was hoping Black would trade rooks here, because his kingside pawns are weaker than my kingside chain, and exploiting pawn weaknesses is easier in pure pawn endgames.} Rb4 {I thought moving the rook along the d-file was better because it keeps my king from advancing to the centre. This may have been Black's losing error, letting my king get to the centre.} 34. b3 g4 35. Kd3 {My king is active in the centre while Black's is stuck on the kingside. If he doesn't retreat his rook and let me onto the 4th rank, I can play Kc3 forcing him to do so, because Re4, like I said, gives Black a weak isolated pawn.} Rb6 36. Kd4 Rc6 {Black can't do much in this position because his pieces aren't as active as mine. Active pieces are the most important thing in winning endgames.} 37. Kd5 Rb6 {As I continue to improve my position, all Black can do is pointlessly maneuver pieces.} 38. Re8 {I am planning to take advantage of Black's weak kingside pawns.} Rc6 39. Rh8 Kg6 40. Rb8 {Attacking the defender of Black's rook.} Rc2 {Black decides to counterattack my pawns instead of passively defending with Rc7.} 41. Rxb7 Rxa2 42. Rb6+ Kg7 43. Ke6 {The most important thing in endgames is to have active pieces. Black's king is inactively placed in the corner while my king and rook are actively directed toward Black's weak kingside pawns.} a5 {Kg6 is dubious because Ke5  takes his king away from his pawn and results in the same position as the actual game, but where Black hasn't played a5.} 44. Kxf5 h5 45. Kg5 Rxh2 {Black offered me a draw again, but this time my position is winning because of Black's weak king and my actively placed pieces.} 46. Rb7+ Kf8 47. f5 {The next moves show how a king and rook can help a passed pawn promote.} Rh3 48. f6 Rxg3 49. Kg6 {Threatening Rb8#} Re3 50. Rb8+ Re8 51. Rxe8+ Kxe8 52. Kg7 {Black resigned. His two pawns can't promote faster than mine, and my king is defending all the squares I need for my pawn to promote. The game would've continued g3 f7  Kd7 f8=Q and my queen would create numerous tactical threats to win the rest of Black's pawns.}
