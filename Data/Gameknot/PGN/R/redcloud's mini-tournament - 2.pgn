1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nf3 e6 4. Bc4 Nc6 5. Nc3 b6 {i've never liked openings which start with fianchetto's on both sides. i just simply cant believe they're a good idea. whilst attempting to controll the centre from afar they are theoretically a good idea i just cant believe that a quickly casteled king and some central pawns aren't better at achieving the same aim.} 6. Bf4 Bb7 {i dont normally open like this, it's too square. it doesnt seem like theres any real attack, but in this case the c7 pawn is weak. i think this is the problem with fianchetto-ing both sides so early.} 7. Nb5 d6 8. Qd2 a6 9. Nc3 {whilst that knight forray seems a little pointless white's developed his queen in the last two moves, whereas black just has some funny looking pawns} Nge7 {i think this is a clear mistake. it causes serious trouble for black later in the game as we'll see and basically completely removes defence except pawns and one black bishop from the kingside. its also hinders the knight's own mobility. it could hactually have moved to more squares from its home square than it can from there!} 10. O-O-O {whilst long castleing tends to lead to complicated double edged positions i felt fairly confident (having the c1-h6 diagonal) that i could displcace blacks black bishop, and remove some of the threat. here i was worried about Nb4, i am unsure if this is justfied but the idea of that queenside mobilizing quickly seemed quite scary, especially as the pawns could conitinue a fair distance without real impediment, after 10)....,b5 11) bd3, e5 black has strong attacking chances on the queenside, a solid challenge for the centre and white's bishop is hemmed in . similarly retreating the bishop to b3 causes further time headaches as does moving the a pawn to provide a space for it to sit. } O-O { castleing here weakens the kningside. with the knight on e7 blocking any queen involvement white chose to attack along the H file, trying to exploit the weaknesses of the fianchetto setup (the knight can easily move to g5 without being threatened, and bh6 forces an exchange of black bishops, which is better for white).} 11. h4 e5 {i think this move should've come under different circumstances (specifically before black had casteled and when black had mobilised his queenside pawns) as now the king is castled white can force exchanges} 12. Bh6 {the idea of giving up the D pawn for this attack i think was risky, though i was confident of my piece mobility and calculated i needed about two extra moves to get under the kingside defence, something that i thought a pawn and a (relitively) useless knight was worth. i think the key aspects of the position are white's dominance of the a2-g7 and d2-h6 diagonals and black's spread and backward development. the pawn on e4 prevents the E knight going anywhere useful quickly, and also restricts the queens movment. similarly the other Knight on c, whilst a potential threat to whites queenside is at the moment just preventing the bishop doing anything useful, as it is not part of a coordinated attack, simply a lone piece with some pawns for backup, agianst a queenside composed of 3 pawns, 2 minor pieces and a queen. also significantly the rooks are fairly inactive, the a rook has potential if the a pawn is pushed but i dont think it ever is.} exd4 13. Bxg7 Kxg7 {(dxc3 is obviously bad for black, after Bxc3,...., Qh6) now things aren't looking great for black, with the exception that the knight can now go to e5! something that was clearly missed in two moves time. } 14. h5 {the key move, this totally commits white to the attack,loosing the knight for tempo. my original (slightly hopeful) analysis was the line: 14)...dxc3, 15)Qxc3+, kg8, 16) h6 which is disasterous for black. other more likely lines i thought of were:  * 14)..., dxc3. 15) Qxc3, f6. 16) Ng5! (threatening the now unprotected e6 and also f7 under protection of the knight), Bc8  (hoping to avoid variation 2!). 17)  h6+, Kh8 (the only option) 18) Nf7+ winning a rook for a knight and an excellent position.   * 15) ..., f6. 16)Ng5, Qe8 17) Ne6+ !, Kh8, 18) Nxf8, Qxf8. 19) Hxg6, Nxg6, 20) Qh3 (leading to positions ismilar to those found after move 20 in this game only with slightly fairer material.  having said that though the way the game did turn out is relatively similar to this for black even with the ?! on move 16} dxc3 { i think Ne5 was better for black. it's got more activating potential and threatens to double white's pawns on the f file, or else create two black connected pawns in the centre. (it also helps to discover an attack on e4.)} 15. Qxc3+ {from here black is in trouble} f6 16. Ng5 Ne5 {was this a mistake or some sort of bizzare tactical sacrifice? i'm still unsure, i hadn't actually thought that black would give up his queen but in effect it is the same as giving up the knight as white had earlier in terms of points, and it certainly improves black's position, (as we see after move 20.) by giving up the queen here, black establishes a knight in the centre of the board, has time to activate one of his rooks on the d file, activates the bishop on b7 (a not insubstantial threat of a bishop for rook trade considering the margin in terms of points is only 3) and potentially gains black a tempi or two (considering the queen has not moved from its original square the entire game wheras the knight has moved a couple of spaces.  also having the knight on e5 allows for the hxg6, Ne7xg6 eventuality and generally re-inforces balcks defensive position  however the one thing that black is still substatially missing is a black bishop. as a result i was less worried about just taking the queen} 17. Ne6+ {white took this not thinking too hard, Knight forks can be hard to spot - i assumed he had just missed it.} Kh8 18. Nxd8 Raxd8 {probably the correct rook to acticate as at the moment defnese is the name of the game. i had though instead of taking immediately blacks answer may have been Nxc4 - removing one of the substatial threats  on his king and giving him time to perhaps recooperate with two strong rooks in the centre of the board, though of course it does fatally weaken the c7 and d and b 6 squares. and althought white may not want to open up his queenside to an attack, the advantage of essentially 2 maybe 3 pawns plus the two knights for a queen going into the endgame would probably be insumountable, even with the strong rooks and extra two minor pieces. had the two black knights been bishops i would have been more worried.} 19. hxg6 Ne7xg6 20. Qh3 {on with the attack!, at this point i was still thinking of ending the game quickly. i thought that the queen and king fork had been an example of the preasure of my attack causing problems and decided to keep the preassure obviously on rather than suring up my position and trading off pieces untill the endgame where i would presumably have an advantage.} Rd7 21. g3 {this move may look silly, but i wanted to make the advantage clear. i was uneasy about the number of pieces (even less important ones) black had on the board. hence i thought about trading my h rook and a pawn for the bishop and the knight on e5. materially exactly equal, and changing whites position very little except to advance my f and g pawns. black cannot move the e knight or else the queen takes the rook on d7. whereas black's position is further weakend, as the a6 pawn is now unprotected and attacked.} Bxe4 22. f4 Bxh1 23. Rxh1 f5 {another mistake i think. more accurate probably would have been Rg7. this would almost certainly have lead me not to expect a checkmate in this game but a long drawn out affair. as it is e6 is now a weak square and a fantastic square to have a bishop on.} 24. fxe5 dxe5 25. Be6 Re7 26. Bxf5 {the exchange worked out clean, that is that whites 3 point advantage is maintained, at the cost of a black passed pawn, though white definately has the initiative here. crucially the mumber of pieces on teh board is now equal (black has one more pawn). so white's worry of a well coordinated minor piece attack is removed. the material advantage boils down for a queen for a rook and a pawn. } Kg7 {another mistake under preasure from the attack, now checkmate is inevitable} 27. Qxh7+ Kf6 28. Qxg6# {}
