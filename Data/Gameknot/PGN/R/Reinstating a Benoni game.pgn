1. d4 {A wild game with edged to edged situations, very funny (at least for the players). Thank you rednif_tap.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. h3 a6 8. a4 {To prevent 8. ... b5} Bg7 {standard developpement} 9. Bd3 O-O 10. Nf3 c4 11. Bxc4 Re8 12. Bd3 {The LSB comes back in his place} Nxe4 {White has to take} 13. Nxe4 {At this moment, I thought black was doing a mistake} f5 {Strong move but dangerous for black} 14. Nfg5 {To protect e4} Bxb2 {Supressing the g knight's support} 15. Bxb2 {Bishop on the big diagonal, aiming at the opponent king.} Qxg5 16. Qf3 {to support the e knight and the g pawn} fxe4 17. Bxe4 Qf5 18. Qc3 {Menacing mate by Qg7} Rxe4+ 19. Kf1 {White cannot castle anylonger, is in late in developpement but has a strong menace on g7 and another by Qxc8.} Qe5 {Preventing the mate} 20. Qxc8+ {So that white uses his other attack. At this point black misevaluated the situation and submited but both players agreed to reinstal the game and carry on.} Qe8 {Black had no other choice (if 20. ... Kf7 21. Qxb7+ Kf8 and white wins the a rook by 22. Qxa8} 21. Qxb7 {Playing this move was strange because both players, at this moment, had access to the GK computer analyse which counselled 21. Qc3 and after 10 moves, exchanging most of the pi√®ces arrived at a position which, in my opinion led to a draw so that I decided to elect another line to gain another pawn in order to have a better endgame. } Nd7 {Black has no other choice to save his rook} 22. Qc6 Nc5 23. Qxd6 {2 pawns advance for a better gameend. Of course, the king situation is unsafe but I judged that I could defend it.} Nd3 {Attacking the unprotected bishop.} 24. Bc3 {Keeping the bishop on the same diagonal, still unprotected but unattacked and aiming at the essential e1 square} Re2 {aiming at f2} 25. Qg3 {The queen came to support her husband.} Nxf2 26. Rg1 {?? Blunder, despite a long hesitation between 26. Rg1 and 26. Rh2, I choosed the bad solution.} Ne4 27. Qe5 {At this point, I tohought I could still save the situation but ...} Nxc3 28. Qxc3 {Mate in 4} Qe4 29. d6 {mate in 3} Rf8+ 30. Qf3 {mate in 2. I submited here but I add the mate now.} Rxf3+ 31. gxf3 Qxf3# {Well done Rednif_tap ! }
