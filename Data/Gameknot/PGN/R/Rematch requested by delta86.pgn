1. e4 d5 {Queen gambit opening offering my d5 pawn. This is a rematch requested by delta86 I accept and the game is on!} 2. e5 {Refused! Thats ok, I expected this move by white.} Bf5 {I bring out a bishop and  have a good look at c2 and h3.} 3. d4 {white protects pawn with a pawn.} Nc6 {I continue to develop with Nc6.} 4. Nf3 {white develops a knight.} e6 {protecting 2 pieces with 1 pawn so far. Ilooking to attack but still need to castle, and get my queen out.} 5. Bb5 {expected move of Bb5 pinning my knight on c6 for the moment.} Qd7 {Queen is out and she is ready to rumble!} 6. O-O {kingside castling by white with full protection of 3 golden pawns. This looks to be an exciting game.} O-O-O {I castle on the weaker queen side, but I do have the knight on c6 which protects my pawn on a7, but at this time is now pinned down from protecting my queen on d7, which is here to allow for the castling on queen side. } 7. Nc3 {white brings out knight.} Nge7 {I bring out knight to the center on e7 instead of f6. I'm thinking of taking  on c6 if whites takes my other knight with a bishop  on b5. This may never happen but I am just developing my attac kon the king side. } 8. Bg5 {white attacks toward my knight on e7 and my rook on d8.} h6 {pawn to h6 to see if that is enought to get the bishop to retreat!.} 9. Bh4 {plan works and bishop retreats to h4.} g5 {pawn to g5 to finishing moving the bishop out of my way.} 10. Bg3 {bishop retreats but now is protecting e5 pawn and has a good look towards my king.} Bg6 {I retreat my LSB to g6 for now.} 11. Na4 {knight moves to the side of the board advancing forward queenside.} Nf5 {I bring out my pesky LSB to f5 for attack on king side.} 12. Nc5 {?white moves  knight to c5.  I have by  DSB on f8.} Bxc5 {?I take the knight But there is a  golden pawn on d4 to take me. I saw the pesky knight and wanted it gone and didn't notice it was not free!. It happens. Will have to see what happens next.} 13. dxc5 { white takes my DSB with a pawn!} a6 {move up pawn to a6 to kick back the LSB.} 14. Ba4 {LSB retreats.} d4 {marching my center pawn towrds the queen on d1. It has 3 protectors 2 knights and my queen. but the 1 knight on c6 is stuck in the mud untill I move my queen. } 15. Nd2 {white knight retreats} Nxg3 {I use my knight to capture whites DSB on on g3 and am most likely7 to be taken with a pawn from the king's side and this will weaken the kings safe hiding fort} 16. fxg3 {pawn takes with f2 pawn which not only takes my knight but also gives white a good look of the f file, } d3 {I push up pawn to d3 and attack c2 pawn and e2 } 17. c3 {white refuses to take my pawn!, That is fine with me} Qd5 {I move queen up to d5 and now have a nice view of g2} 18. b4 {white thinks taking a fast double pawn move to b4 is  the best move} Nxe5 {I take a pawn with my pesky night and now have a outpost on e5 with 5 different moves from this spot. That is why I call my knights pesky.} 19. Re1 {simple counter move rook to e1 attacking the efile!} f6 {I protect my knight with a pawn, and now have 6 different places to move.} 20. Nf3 {white looks to trade knights by moving to f3.} d2 {I move up the passed pawn to d2 now, breating down the white rook on e2,} 21.

Kg2 {white moves King to g2.} Qd3 {I move Queen to d3} 25. Bc2 {LSB moves to c2 to scare off my queen to a dark square maybe.} Qxc3 {I move queen to c3} 26. a3 {white moves pawn to a3} e5 {I advance a pawn to e5} 27. Bf5+ {white checks with LSB to f5} Kb8 {king is moved to b8} 28. Be4 {LSB is active and moves to e4.} Bb3 {I move my LSB to b3 and attack whites queen! this is enough for white who resigns. Did white resign too early? I think I was going to checkmate white soon. The passed pawn was up for promotion and was going  to either take the queen or get promoted onn d1. depending on how white would have played. I think when you resign the game and your not losing, you are only huirting yourself. Does anyone think they could take white from here and win?}
