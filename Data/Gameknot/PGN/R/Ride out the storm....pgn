1. e3 {From a recent mini-tournament, white opens with the unconventional Van 't Kruijs opening. The opening is somewhat passive as it hinders the DSB, but has plenty of transpositional value as we could arrive in an English or Queen's pawn game, or reversed french or dutch. } e5 {I respond with intuitive moves that gain space and develop but soon gets me into trouble as white launches an attack on the kingside. } 2. b3 a6 {A wasted move, I must have been worried about the bishop coming to b5, but a move like ...d5 or ...Nf6 is much better. } 3. Bb2 Nc6 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Qe2 d5 6. O-O-O {White has adopted an unconventional opening and has gotten a passive position. No tactics for black are immediate but Crafty-20.14 gives the position -.54 suggesting 6... b5. } Bf5 7. Kb1 {Gives white trouble after 7.... d4! 8. exd4 Bxc2 !   } Bd6 8. d3 O-O 9. h3 b5 10. Rc1 Ne7 {Repositioning the knight for kingside defense and to start a queen-side pawn storm. } 11. g4 Be6 12. g5 Nd7 {Tricky position, black has been pushed back, but isn't exactly cramped, d-knight can go to b6, e-knight has f5 or d5 after d4 is played and both bishops have some squares. Meanwhile white has three undeveloped pieces on his kingside. } 13. h4 c5 14. Nf3 Nf5 15. h5 g6 {oops. Bad move, completely gives away any edge Black has built up and allows for hxg6. 15... b4 probably a draw, but ...g6 is almost a win for white. } 16. hxg6 fxg6 17. Bh3 d4 18. Ne4 Be7 19. Nh4 {19. exd4 cxd4 20. Bxd4 Bxb3 21. cxb3 exd4 22. Bxf5 Rxf5 23. Nxd4 Bxg5 24.Nxf5 Bxc1 leads to excellent game for White. } Bxg5 20. Nxg6 hxg6 {White has a huge advantage which they give away right....} 21. Bxf5 {....here. 21. Rcg1 forces home the edge. Bxf5 allows black to defend against future attacks and now the knight sacrifice puts white on the defense. } Bxf5 22. Nxg5 Qxg5 23. Rcg1 Qf6 24. e4 Be6 25. Bc1 c4 {Having a hard time finding good moves I start to push the pawns on the queenside. Had White played Rh6 Black would have been in another pickle.} 26. Qe1 {Gives up the defense of key squares. 26... cxd3! 27. cxd3 Rac8 } a5 27. Rxg6+ Qxg6 28. Rg1 {White has spent many moves hoping to set up this pin(instead of playing Rh6), but actually Black can stop it...} Bg4 29. f3 Rxf3 30. Qh4 Nf6 {Now White is really in trouble and the slow role of the pawns that Black has been pushing up the queenside will start to tell. } 31. dxc4 bxc4 32. Rh1 Kf7 33. Qe1 cxb3 34. cxb3 Qxe4+ {Force the trade of queens and I see a mate involving moving the rook to f2, check on c3 with the knight, then mate on a2. } 35. Qxe4 Nxe4 36. Rh7+ Kg6 37. Rh6+ Kf5 38. a4 Rf2 {Some spite checks from the rook and now black has time to set up the mate. } 39. Rh1 Nc3+ 40. Ka1 Ra2# {}
