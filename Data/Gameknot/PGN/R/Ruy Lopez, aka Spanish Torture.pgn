1. e4 {Here's another mysterious resignation... I don't mind people resigning against me but it would help my sanity if I understood why!  This game is in a pretty serious mini-tournament in which I'm not doing very well, so this game was a nice bonus...} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O Bc5 5. c3 O-O 6. d4 Bb6 7. Re1 d6 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 g5 {Is Black overstretching himself with this move?} 10. Bg3 g4 {and even more so with this?} 11. dxe5 gxf3 12. exf6 Qxf6 13. Qxf3 Qxf3 14. gxf3 {as the smoke clears, White is a doubled pawn ahead, hardly worth crowing about.} Kh7 {Black makes room for his rook to attack on the g-file, I think.} 15. Nd2 {Developing my last minor piece as quickly as possible.} Be6 {ditto for Black} 16. Kh1 {Vacating the g-file for my rook} a6 17. Bd3 {attacked, by B retreats to set up a discovered attack on Black's king.} f5 {Black blocks that line of attack} 18. exf5 Bxf5 19. Bxf5+ Rxf5 20. f4 {and Black resigned!  Why?}
