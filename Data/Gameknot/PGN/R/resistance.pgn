[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 Nf6 2. g3 c5 {Turning it into a symmetrical english. A favourite responce of my opponents. } 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. Nc3 e6 {preparing the thematic d pawn thrust. } 5. Nf3 d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Qb3 {?! Almost certaintly premature. However I wanted to see how black would respond, I was trying to induce black to over extend. It was also designed to prevent black developing his LSB for a little while. } Be7 8. d3 {opening lines for my DSB. } O-O 9. O-O Na5 {I'm not too sure about this move. my queen wasn't doing a whole lot and this move only mislaces the knight who will now use a further tempo to get back into the game. I presumed at the time though that maybve this is so black can develop his LSB.  } 10. Qc2 {It was hard for me to decide which square was better for my queen this one or d1. I went with this because it clears the backrank and eyes down the b1-h7 diagonal. In light of what happened I wonder if the queen would have been better suited on d1. } Be6 11. Bf4 {Giving better scope for my bishop.  } Nh5 {I had wondered if black might try this. It didn't concern me too much. Knights on the rim are dim, well black has both his knights on the edge. } 12. Bd2 {Keeping the rooks connected As well as targetting the knight on a5. } Nc6 {natural  } 13. Rfd1 {maybe Rac1 would have been better. } Rc8 {Good move. Placing a rook on the same file as the opponents queen is rarely a bad idea, this is emphasised by what happens in a few moves time. } 14. a3 {? creates a whopping big whole on b3 I even realised this during the game but played this to keep the knight out of b4, bad desision as the knight coming to b4 was no threat and the knight still had d4 anyway. } f5 {also good was the immedaite Nd4. } 15. e4 {Deciding I had to make a strike at the centre before my position became to crsmped. } fxe4 16. dxe4 Nd4 {! I had realised that blacks best play would be in getting the knihgt to d4 however I had not realised he could play it straight away. Now White cannot take the knight because after cxd4 white will lose the knight on account of the pin to the queen. } 17. Qd3 {Qa4 would have covered b3 however it didn't seem clear to me so avoided it. It was probably best.  } Nb3 18. Rab1 {I did spend a while considering ways of sacking the exchange wit either Nxd5 or exd5 however there were always refutions so I went with this preserving the rook instead. } c4 19. Qe2 {?  I thought I would eye the knihgt on h5, however this allows white next move.  } Bg4 {I had wondered if black might play this but I figured it was fine for me, what I mised was that black can bring his knight to d4. } 20. Nxd5 {So of course having missed that I played this thinking I had won a pawn. } Bxf3 21. Bxf3 Nd4 {Nacth, I hadn't thought about this. } 22. Nxe7+ {? this seemed most logical however an intersting idea occured to me. by leaving the knight where it was I might actually have been able to keep material relatively even with 22.Bxh5!? Nxe2+ 23.Bxe2. Now I am two points down the same as If I had preserved the queen. however white is threatning to is threatning to gain the exchange for compensation which would leave material even. It would leave the position unclear as white has many ways in which to gain the exchange. } Qxe7 23. Qe3 {Now that white has given up the knight on d5 this is probably better than Bxh5. } Nxf3+ 24. Kg2 Nxd2 25. Rxd2 Nf6 26. e5 Ng4 27. Qe4 Nf6 28. Qe2 {threatens the knight. } Nd7 29. Re1 {I had been thinking of playing Rbd1 with the idea that white complicates things if Nxe5, then I realised that Qxe5 would be fine for black. } b5 30. f4 {I deciced to solidify my main asset and hopefully this gives my other pieces more freedom of movement. } Nc5 31. Red1 Qb7+ {Of course having pushed my f pawn my king is now a little more exposed that he otherwise would have been. } 32. Kg1 Nd3 {this is good, I also wondewredif black might have played ...Qb6 but this is I think even better. } 33. b3 {This was a tough descision for me on one hand it challenges the c pawn but on the other hand it now means the c pawn is passed and is a real threat. } Qb6+ 34. Kg2 {?! wrong square I think. After this move I realised black had potential forking ideas. this allows ...Rxf4!  } Qg6 {I think Rxf4! right away would have won on the spot. I thought I had something prepared but I cant see how white gets out of it after that. } 35. Kh1 Qc6+ 36. Qg2 {Offering a queen trade in the hopes thatthe knight vs panw would be difficult for black to win. } Qc5 {Declining the trade. I wonder what would happen if lack had tried to push the c pawn instead. I suppose 36. ...c3 37.Qxc6 Rxc6 38.Rxd3 c2 39.Rc1 } 37. a4 a6 38. axb5 {My understanding that pawns should be traded in the endgame. } axb5 39. bxc4 bxc4 40. Rc2 {threatning the knight. } Qb6 41. h3 {giving my king some better sqaures where there is no check threatned. } Rfd8 42. Kh2 Kf8 {?! } 43. Qe4 {Because my queen has f5, maybe g6 clamps down on that. } Qb3 44. Rcd2 Kg8 {admitting Kf8 was an inaccuracy. } 45. h4 {perhaps e6 immediatly? } Rca8 {Black wants to trade rooks by playing Ra2. I need to try and avoid that so...      I actually thought that black would try pushing the pawn here. } 46. e6 {! now Ra2 doesn't quite work. } Rde8 47. Qd5 {! Again stopping Ra2 plus creating a couple of threats of my own. } Rad8 {I didn't realise this at the time but this actually allows white to win back a piece. 48.Rxd3!  } 48. Qf5 {Not as good as Rxd3! but atleast this threatns Qf7+. } Re7 49. Qa5 Rde8 50. f5 {My position has gradually started to improve. And now black is going to find it hard to win. } Qb7 51. Qc3 Qe4 52. Rf1 Ne5 53. Rf4 {! and now my position is very good and fun to play. of course Qe1 is forced.  } Qe1 {Now the queen is practically trapped on the back rank. Blacks knight is also frozen in place his rooks and king dont have mush good moves either, black is nearly in zungzwang! } 54. h5 {a neat little move that does quite alot. } h6 {forced. I would love to play Rff2 here but unfotunatly that means black could play Ng4+. so the idea for white is to move his king. Also Rc2 comes into consideration where a queen trade is practially forced and white can go about setting up something of a fortress.  } 55. Kh3 {?! this was the wrong square for the king, instead Kg2! and black is scrathing his head and very nearly is in zungzwang.This allows blacks queen to escape the backrank. } Qh1+ 56. Rh2 Qd5 {only square } 57. Rd2 Qc5 58. Re4 Nd3 59. Rxd3 {?? I had even worked out that this was impossible because of f5 but I just forgot that and did this anyway. A shame really as I feel I had put up a good fight and had quite a nice position for a while there. } Qxf5+ {}
