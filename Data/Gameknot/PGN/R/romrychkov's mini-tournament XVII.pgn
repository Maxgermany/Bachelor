1. e4 {More Pre-emptive Revenge.  And boy am I paying for it. My opponent in this one has been mean to me ever since. But it was worth it.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {There is that d6 again, still not convinced about that reply.} 3. Bc4 h6 4. Nc3 c6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 Be7 {Error there, black needs to develop sure, but leaving that poor g7 pawn was cruel.} 7. Qxg7 {So being the kind soul I am I put it out of its misery.} Be6 {At the time I expected B-f6. Now I see why he didn't.} 8. Qxh8 {But I'm quite happy to go rampaging.} Kd7 9. Bxe6+ Kxe6 10. Qh7 {Deliberate set up for the mate.} Nd7 {Wayyyy too late to start developing. Getting the king back would have been better and saccing f7.} 11. Qf5# {Against a better player, very satisfying.... even if he is slaughtering me for it.}
