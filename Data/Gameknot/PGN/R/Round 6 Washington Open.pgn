1. e4 {Start off with e4.} c5 {Black plays c5, yet another Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 {Nf3} d6 {d6} 3. Nc3 {nc3} g6 {g6} 4. h3 {h3, preventing Bg4.} Bg7 {Bg7} 5. d4 {d4} cxd4 {cxd4} 6. Nxd4 {Nxd4.  Hoping for 6. ...Bxd4 7.Qxd4 Nf6 8. Bh6, preventing castling. 7. ... f6 would have been good too.} Nf6 {Nf6, foiling that plan.} 7. Bc4 {Bc4, opening up for castling.} Bd7 {Bd7.} 8. O-O {O-O} O-O {O-O} 9. Be3 {Be3} Nc6 {Nc6} 10. Nxc6 {Nxc6} Bxc6 {Bxc6} 11. f3 {f3, defending e-pawn. 11. e5 was also an option,either removing the knight from its spot or setting up a queen trade, but I wasn't ready for that yet.} e6 {e6} 12. Bg5 {Bg5, preparing once again for 13. e5, this time forcing a queen trade.} h6 {h6. Obviously Black doesn't like that idea.} 13. Bxf6 {Bxf6.  Want to open up the diagonal, willing to trade the bishop for the knight.} Bxf6 {Bxf6} 14. Qd2 {Qd2, obviously looking at Qxh6.} Qb6+ {Qb6 } 15. Kh1 {Kh1.  No more attacks there.} Qxb2 {Qxb2.  I lose a pawn in the process.} 16. Ne2 {Ne2, setting myself up for a Queen for Two rook trade.  But I would have lost the Knight otherwise, with 16. ... Bxc3.} Rad8 {Rad8, protecting d-pawn.} 17. Rab1 {Rab1} Qe5 {Qe5} 18. Rbd1 {Rbd1, trying to take over the d-file.} Bg5 {Bg5, attacking the Queen.} 19. Qd4 {Qd4, offering Queen trade and also threatening the a-pawn.} Qxd4 {Qxd4} 20. Nxd4 {Nxd4.  I want the knight-bishop trade.} d5 {d5, pressuring me.} 21. Nxc6 {Nxc6} bxc6 {bxc6} 22. Bb3 {High-tail the bishop out of there and try to advance the c-pawn.} Rdb8 {Rb8, doesn't do much.} 23. c4 {c4, wanting to clear the d-file} dxc4 {dxc4, as excpected} 24. Bxc4 {Bxc4} Rfd8 {Rfd8, proposing a rook trade.} 25. g3 {g3.  I don't want the bishop on f4} Rxd1 {Rxd1} 26. Rxd1 {Rxd1} Rd8 {Rd8, proposing another trade.  I'm really hesitant to do so, since I'm down a pawn and the endgame is fast approaching.} 27. Rxd8+ {Rxd8 .  I figure that I need to get rid of his rook since it will just gobble my pawns.  Also, most of my pawns are on light squares, so the bishop can't do anything about them.  I figure I have good draw chances here.} Bxd8 {Bxd8.  Let the pawn fun begin.} 28. g4 {g4.  Now they're all on light squares.} g5 {g5.  Black intends to put his pawns on dark squares the same as me.  Only problem for me is that c-pawn.} 29. Kg2 {Kg2.  King has to come into the action at some point.} Bc7 {Bc7} 30. Kf2 {Kf2} Bf4 {Bf4} 31. Ke2 {Ke2} Kf8 {Kf8} 32. Kd3 {Kd3} e5 {e5, blocking off d4.} 33. Ba6 {Ba6, blocking a-pawn.} Ke7 {Ke7} 34. a4 {a4} Kd6 {Kd6, leaving me with one option.} 35. Kc4 {Kc4 is the only way to go here.} Kc7 {Kc7} 36. Kc5 {Kc5} Be3+ {Be3 } 37. Kc4 {Kc4} Kb6 {Kb6.  Time to move the bishop} 38. Bc8 {Bc8.} Ka5 {Ka5, threatening my a-pawn.} 39. Bd7 {Bd7, only way to save the pawn.} c5 {c5.} 40. Be8 {Be8, overworking the bishop but still threatening.} f6 {f6} 41. Bd7 {bd7} Kb6 {Kb6.  At this point, we both realized that not much can be accomplished here for either side and agreed to a draw. }
