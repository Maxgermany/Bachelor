[Opening "French (C07), Tarrasch, open variation"]

1. e4 {e4. Standard King's Pawn opening move.} e6 {e6. The French Defense - my usual opening.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {Nd2. The Tarrasch variation, most commonly played by Grandmasters nowadays to this line.} c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Ngf3 Qb6 6. exd5 exd5 7. dxc5 Bxc5 {Quite a lot of pressure on the f2 pawn. In fact, Bxf2 , Ke2, Qe3 is mate!} 8. Qe2+ {Qe2 ; a good way to gain a tempo and stop the threats.} Be6 9. b4 Bd6 10. Ng5 Nd8 11. Ndf3 {Good pressure from White; Black's playing defensively.} h6 12. Nxe6 Nxe6 13. Be3 Qc7 14. Qd2 Nf6 15. Bb5+ Ke7 {I deemed it safe to move the king. This is because if I blocked the B with the N, the pawn on d5 would drop. Also, a form of by hand castling can also be done after Rd8 and Kf8.} 16. Rc1 a6 17. Ba4 b5 18. Bb3 Qc6 19. O-O Rhd8 20. Rfe1 Ne4 21. Qc2 Rac8 22. Bd4 Kf8 {The 'castling' manoever is complete.} 23. Bxd5 {Obviously, the N is regained shortly afterwards.} Qxd5 24. Rxe4 Ng5 25. Nxg5 Qxg5 26. Rce1 Bxb4 {Same trick back!} 27. Bxg7+ {Thus regaining the pawn for a bit, and splitting my pawns.} Qxg7 28. Rxb4 Qxc3 29. Qxc3 Rxc3 30. a4 bxa4 31. Rxa4 Rc6 32. g3 Kg7 33. Re7 Ra8 34. Kg2 {Black now has very passive play, otherwise the a6 pawn can be taken. If the rook moves off the a file, then the White rook on e7 will come to a7 to win the pawn.} Rf6 35. f3 Kf8 36. Rb7 Kg7 37. g4 Rc6 38. h4 Rg6 39. Kg3 Kf8 40. f4 f5 41. g5 hxg5 42. fxg5 {Black wants to force a swap off of the dangerous passed pawns - but they are now connected passed pawns!} Rc6 43. Kf4 Rc5 44. h5 a5 45. h6 Kg8 46. Kg3 Rc3+ 47. Kh4 Rc1 48. g6 Rc5 {To prevent Rxa5, and if RxR, Rb8 Rc8 Rxc8 mate.} 49. Kg5 Rd5 50. h7+ Kh8 {The king is now trapped! All White has to do is defend the h7 pawn and play g7#.} 51. Kh6 Rd6 52. Rf7 Re8 53. Rxa5 Rc8 {Black is doomed while his pawns fall. However, all of this leads to stalemate.} 54. Raxf5 {Taking the pawn, and threatening Rf8 Rxf8 Rxf8#.} Rxg6+ {Rxg6 ! The only hope. This still does not draw by itself, however.} 55. Kxg6 Rc6+ 56. Kg5 {Kg5?? The game is now drawn (I think). R5f6 would also have been a draw, as after RxR  RxR or KxR it is drawn. R7f6 wins for White, I think.} Rg6+ 57. Kf4 Rg4+ 58. Ke3 Re4+ {The rook can now keep on the fourth rank whatever White does. A drawn position, and if White ever takes the rook it is stalemate. Well done to White for getting the won endgame, but always be wary of stalemate!}
