[Opening "Sicilian (B32), Labourdonnais-Loewenthal variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nf3 {Not overly familiar with the Sicilian, not keen on this move as it breaks the rule of moving the same piece twice in the opening.} Nf6 6. Bd3 {Protects, but is this where bishops belong?  No!} d5 7. Bb5 {exd5 would be better, this move could lead to Qa5 , Nc3 d4} Qd6 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. O-O {King to safety} Nxe4 10. Re1 {Hoping to get some kind of pin, however I was fealing very undeveloped at this stage, space count, white = 4 black = 12!!} Be7 11. Nxe5 {Ok, I took over a minute on this move, sure that I could win the knight on e4 with a pin (Qxe5, f3).  It turns out I did win it, but Fritz found a way for it to be saved!  So this move got a '?' in analysis, at least it wasn't '??'} Qxe5 12. f3 {Attacking the pinned piece} Bc5+ 13. Be3 Bxe3+ 14. Rxe3 O-O 15. Qc1 {I think that fxe4 could be played immediately here, however at the time I thought that b2 and a1 might fall, however I don't think this is the case, fxe4 Qxb2, Nc3 d4, Rb1 Qe3, Qxd4 might be one way around this} f5 16. fxe4 fxe4 17. c3 {releases the pin on b2} Ba6 {threatening a royal fork, Rf1 } 18. Nd2 Qf4 19. Qe1 Bd3 20. Qg3 Rab8 21. b3 Rbe8 22. Rae1 {Now here I was expecting a trade of queens (or Fritz's g5 seems even stronger), to which I think black would have won, however I was pleased to see the next move which enabled me to execute my plan and the game swings into white as the favourite} c5 {Poor!  g5 'nails it down' (Fritz)} 23. Qxf4 {Only reply is to capture back, isn't it?  The defender to e8 IS f8!} Rxf4 {Which now means that d3 can be munched by the rook on e3.  the pawn on e4 is then pinned.  My palms were less sweaty by this stage ;)} 24. Rxd3 {!} exd3 25. Rxe8+ Kf7 26. Ra8 {Black resigns as pawns will fall and his passed pawn on d3 poses no real threat.  Hope you enjoyed my annotation.}
