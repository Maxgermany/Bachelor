1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 {Setting up the Grandprix Attack.  A more solid, positional move is g3, setting up a Closed Sicilian.} g6 {Preparing to fianchetto.} 4. Nf3 Bg7 {This is one of the two longest diagonals on the board.  The bishop can be used effectively here, but with proper play I can cancel out this advantage for black.} 5. Bb5 {Another option is Bc4, but I like this less because black has the option of playing e6, limiting the bishop's usefulness.  Bb5 is more proactive, aiming for an exchange of minor pieces, as the white bishop will not be very helpful in white's coming attack.} d6 6. d3 Bd7 7. O-O a6 {This forces the exchange right away.} 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. Qe1 {The queen can now go for h5, or support a central advance.} Nf6 10. Bd2 {Probably a weak move, now that I think about it.  White essentially wastes a move. } O-O 11. Qh4 {Aims at the potential weak spot on h6.} Qc7 {Helps black to connect the rooks.  Still, it seems a little passive in light of the coming attack.} 12. e5 {Now if black chooses to exchange pawns, the f6 knight will be forced away, allowing a maelstorm of lightning quick attacks on the kingside.} Nd5 13. f5 {This allows the bishop into the game, aiming for h6.  Also, there are some threats with f6 that need to be dealt with.  This position is difficult for black to defend.} Nxc3 14. Bxc3 {Though this takes away the potential move to h6, it backs up the f6 shove.} Bxf3 15. Rxf3 d5 {This move comes too late.} 16. Rh3 h6 17. f6 {Now black has to lose his bishop or lose to a mating attack.} exf6 18. exf6 h5 {Or 18...Bh8 19.Qxh6 with mate thereafter.} 19. fxg7 Rfe8 20. Bf6 {Prevents black from cutting off the bishop's diagonal with d4.} Re6 21. Rf1 Rae8 22. Qg5 {Black resigned.  The threat of Qh6 and then mate is unstoppable.}
