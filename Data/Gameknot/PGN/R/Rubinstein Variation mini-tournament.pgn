1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 O-O {All the games begin here.} 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. O-O Qc7 11. Qc2 c4 12. Bf5 Re8 {Both sides have castled, and we proceed into the middle-game.} 13. a4 Bxf5 {I gain in time by capturing a developed piece in return for an undeveloped one. I was expecting the simple recapture 14 QxB.} 14. Qd2 Ne4 {H'mmm. Not sure why White didn't recapture, but I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.} 15. Qe1 Re6 {My pieces seem to be pointing in the direction of White's King, so I try engaging in some tactics.} 16. h3 h6 {Creating "Luft" if necessary and keeping the White Knight away from KN5.} 17. Ba3 Rg6 {I don't think this will go anywhere, but he's already made one blunder. There's no harm in applying a bit of pressure...} 18. Nh4 Rf6 {H'mmm. White, despite being behind in material, looks like he wants to ease the pressure by exchanging.} 19. Nxf5 Rxf5 {Being ahead by a piece, I have no problem at all with that.} 20. Kh1 Rh5 {Let's keep being aggressive...} 21. f3 Ng5 {With that open diagonal for my Queen, 22... NxRP 23 PxN RxP ch could lead places...} 22. f4 Ne4 {Rats. He shut down the diagonal. Oh well, at least my Knight ended up on a strong square.} 23. Kg1 Rf5 {Well, my little tactical excursion led nowhere, but I did exchange a pair of minor pieces and get a Knight planted on K5, so I'm not unhappy with the result.} 24. Bb2 Na5 {My other Knight is eyeing the spot at QN6... that would be a good outpost.} 25. g4 Rf6 {H'mmm. Have to make a retreat with the Rook.} 26. Kg2 Nb3 {OK, so *now* I'll occupy the square, it just got pushed back one move.} 27. Rd1 Re6 {Starting...} 28. Kf3 Rae8 {...and completing the doubling of my Rooks.} 29. Ba3 Nd6 {The target is the backward White K pawn.} 30. Bxd6 Qxd6 {I have no problem at all with piece exchanges. The more of them the better.} 31. h4 Re6e7 {Making way for...} 32. Rf2 Qe6 {...Her Royal Highness.} 33. Re2 Qe4+ {Pressing the issue.} 34. Kf2 Qg6 {Looking to pick off a Pawn or two while I'm at it.} 35. Kf3 f5 {Adding force to my attack on the KNP.} 36. g5 hxg5 {I kill off the threat of a White pawn storm.} 37. hxg5 Qh5+ {OK, let's see if I can cause some damage.} 38. Kf2 Qh2+ {Continuing to press...} 39. Kf1 Qh1+ {Now...} 40. Kf2 Qxe1+ {...I can trade off the Queens. With every exchange my material advantage looms larger.} 41. Rdxe1 g6 {Locking the Pawn position and keeping the backward KP in my sights.} 42. Rh1 Rh7 {I'm not opposed...} 43. Rxh7 Kxh7 {...at all to trading Rooks.} 44. Kf3 Kg7 {Guarding the potential entryway.} 45. Rh2 Rh8 {I offer another trade...} 46. Rg2 a6 {...but this time, White declines.} 47. Kf2 b5 {I have an edge on the Q-side with my Pawns.} 48. axb5 axb5 {Now if I can advance my QNP, I can force away the White pawn blocking my QBP.} 49. Kf3 Nc1 {I look to reposition my Knight more centrally.} 50. Kf2 Nd3+ {Ah, that's better. } 51. Ke2 Rh4 {"Pass."} 52. Kd2 Kf7 {The Q-side is where the action is. I'd better get my King over that way.} 53. Re2 Rh8 {And my Rook, too.} 54. Rg2 Ra8 {If White keeps his King on that rank...} 55. Ke2 Ra2+ {...I can make the Rooks vanish.} 56. Kf3 Rxg2 {Time to remove Black's last piece.} 57. Kxg2 Ke6 {OK, now I need to head for the Q-side.} 58. Kf3 Nb2 {OK, I just wasted a move here.} 59. Ke2 Kd6 {That's more like it.} 60. Kd2 Nd3 {Had to put it back.} 61. Ke2 Kc6 {Time to head for a square where I can guard QN5.} 62. Kd2 Kb6 {White, too, heads for the battleground.} 63. Kc2 Ka5 {The Knight and Pawn keep him from the valuable squares at QB2 and QB3.} 64. Kb1 Ka4 {Here I come.} 65. Ka2 Nc1+ {Have to make him move his King.} 66. Kb2 Ne2 {Ducking out of the way...} 67. Kc2 b4 {Finally!} 68. cxb4 Kxb4 {Now I just have to Queen the passed Pawn.} 69. Kb2 Ng3 70. Kc2 c3 71. Kb1 Kb3 72. Kc1 c2 73. Kd2 Kb2 74. Ke1 c1=Q+ {Mission accomplished. Black could have resigned...} 75. Kf2 Ne4+ 76. Ke2 Qc2+ 77. Kf3 Qd1+ 78. Kg2 Qe2+ 79. Kh3 Qxe3+ 80. Kh4 Qg3# {...but he played it out to mate.}
