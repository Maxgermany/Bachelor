[Opening "French (C06), Tarrasch, closed variation, main line"]

1. e4 {Rublevsky is a very powerful GM, but he has a very narrow (but well analyzed) opening repertiore.  I've heard claims that this has stopped him from passing the 2700 mark, but I can't really say.} e6 {The french defense, a favorite of Volkov.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {Rublevsky always chooses the tarrasch against the french.  The most natural move is 3.Nc3, this move also develops the knight without blocking the c pawn.  This also avoids the winawer (3.Nc3 Bb4) as 3... Bb4? is easily parried by the strong 4.c3.} Nf6 {The knight comes forward with pressure.} 4. e5 {And white pushes the knight away with tempo.  The pawn on e5 guarantees a nice spacial advantage.} Nfd7 {However, black's knight can become active on d7, it controls c5 (which is black's standard pawn break) and pressures e5.  As happens later in this game, it also can return to f6.} 5. Bd3 {A good square for the bishop, the d2 knight will eventually have to move (to let the c1 bishop into the game), and f3 seems the ideal square, thus a plan needs to be found for the g1 knight.  It's best square (besides f3) is e2, so the bishop should develop first, instead of being blocked in.} c5 {Black's standard pawn break.} 6. c3 {And white defends, making a pawn chain that gives great space on the kingside.} Nc6 {Black continues to develop while pressuring d4.} 7. Ne2 {White follows his chosen scheme of development while defending d4.} cxd4 8. cxd4 f6 {Black chooses to underming white's center, he hopes to leave white with an isolated queen's pawn, and white is forced to oblige due to the pressure on e5.} 9. exf6 Nxf6 10. O-O Bd6 11. Nf3 O-O {Both sides have gotten well into development, and both seem reasonably placed.  White's weakness on d4 is offset by black's backwards pawn on e6.  White's a little more aimed at the kingside and black has an awful bishop on c8.  I think white has a definite advantage here, but black is perfectly playable.  White should try to gain control of the dark squares (as black has huge holes there).} 12. Bf4 {White's dark squared domination plan begins with exchanging off black's 'good' bishop.} Bxf4 13. Nxf4 Ne4 {This move comes with a discovered attack on the f4 knight, it also places black's knight on a momentarily active square, however it's not well supported and it won't stay there long.} 14. Nh5 {White's knight looks very threatening on the kingside, but it's also on the edge, and it isn't immediately threatening, so I think black should ignore it instead of the following move.} g6 {All but one of black's pawns are on light squares making dark squared penetration from white very dangerous.} 15. Ng3 Nxg3 16. hxg3 {And black has lost his powerful outpost.  White has the far better bishop, the space advantage has stayed and there are potential dark squared problems for black.} Qb6 17. Qa4 Bd7 {? This is a definite inaccuracy, but it's subtle.  However, it's not because he should grab on b2, after 17... Qxb2 white can play 18.Bb5 (there may be better, but this is VERY strong) this combines threats of Bxc6 winning back the pawn with an excellent position and the even more powerful Rab1 where after ...Qc3 the move Rfc1 wins at least a piece.  The reason this move (17... Bd7) is bad is because of which pieces are important, black's got a bad bishop and his knight is clearly black's strongest piece.  On the other hand, while white's got a great bishop it's his knight that can access the holes like e5 and g5 in black's position.} 18. Bb5 {!! A great positional move designed to gain an advantageous knight vs. bishop position.  Later Volkov played 17... a6! in order to stop this move, though I still have a definite preference for white- all of black's pawns are on light squares.  This means if white's queen can find a good square for dark square control black'll be filled with weaknesses.} Rac8 19. Rac1 {Both sides bring rooks the ever important c file.} a6 {And black's pawns are now ALL on light squares.} 20. Bxc6 Bxc6 21. Qa3 {! As I've pointed out, the important squares for white to attack are the dark squares, with this move, white gets good control of the third rank and threatens infiltration to e7.} Bb5 {Black tries to get his bishop into the game.} 22. Rfe1 Rxc1 {Black has an interesting plan.  It doesn't actually work, but he tries to either trade his bishop for the knight, or at least win one of the two weak pawns (b2 and d4).  This move wins a tempo, and draws the rook away from the e file, where it attacks the backward e6 pawn and covers the e2 square where black wants to put his bishop.} 23. Rxc1 Be2 {How does white defend the pawn without allowing his strong knight to be traded off?  He utilizes his advantages, the weak black e pawn and the pressure on dark squares.} 24. Ng5 {! The knight pops into and aggresive (dark) square, hits e6 and indirectly defends the d pawn due to the pretty tactic 24... Qxd4 25.Qxf8 ! Kxf8 26.Nxe6  forking and queen and winning a rook overall.  Also the infiltration of Qe7 is looking VERY strong.} Re8 {Black defends e6 and covers the e7 square.} 25. Qe3 {Another strong move, it attack e2, piles on the e6 square and prepares the following combination.  Where's the bishop going to go?} Qxb2 {Instead of retreating the bishop black grabs a pawn, so what does white have in compensation?  Black is STILL filled with holes, he has three pieces that easily enter the attack to black's one on defense, how does he utilize this...} 26. Rc8 {White's going to win e6 and the black is going to be ripped apart.  Until now white has had a solid advantage and he's played for solid positional game, now it culminates in a powerful attack.} Rxc8 27. Qxe6+ Kg7 28. Qe7+ {Until now, it looked like white was going to regain material, but this move starts an attack that leads to mate 8 moves later, it's amazing what GMs can see!  Note that this check is on a dark square, the dark weakness is still very important to this attack, and white utilizes the h4-d8 diagonal.} Kh6 29. Nf7+ Kg7 30. Ng5+ Kh6 {This kind of repetition is common in GM play, it tests the waters to see if somone'll screw up (29... Kh5? 30.Qg5#) and gains a little time.  Now white plays the right move.} 31. Ne6 {! It's very difficult to spot this type of move, when you sacrifice a rook it's very risky (and scary) to play moves that aren't checks, this threatens mate on g5 and locks the black king on the edge.} Qc1+ {The check covers the g5 square with win of tempo.} 32. Kh2 Rc6 {This is the one time when black gets time for a move in the defense, so I'm tempted to think there must be better than this move, but I see no defense to the following attack.  Black hopes to play ...Rxe6 ending the attack up a piece.} 33. Qg7+ {It's too bad that Qh4  is blocked by ...Bh5 and Qg5  is covered by the black queen.  However with this move the black king is driven farther into the open.} Kh5 34. f4 {! Another excellent quiet move in the attack!  This locks out the queen's defense of h6 and white now threatens to take on h7 without black being able to block, here's a sample line: 34... Rxe6 35.Qxh7  Kg4 36.Qh3#.} h6 {The only move to cover h6, but the dark squares (as always) prove a weakness for black.} 35. Qf6 {! A third quiet move that white had to see when he sacked the rook.  The threat of Qh4# is ALMOST unstoppable.} g5 36. Ng7+ {And black resigns in view of 36... Kg4 37.Qf5#.  I think this was a wonderful attack, white played excellent moves to cover the dark squares at the end, but all along white was creating holes, by move 19 black had all SIX pawns on light squares.  I think the bishop for knight exchange was the best move of the game, it led to black's inability to defend dark squares, and made black lose his one strong piece.  This was also a surprisingly powerful attack for so few pieces, but black's holes made up for the lack of pieces.  I hope you enjoyed this game!
