1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. Nf3 {Standard move so far, but...} dxc4 {This is a riskier move, allowing White to develop more quickly.} 7. Bxc4 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Qe2 {This is a strong move, restraining ...e5 and allowing Rooks to pressure on the e and later the d-file.} Nbd7 10. Re1 {More pressure. } Nb6 11. Bb3 Nbd5 12. Ne5 {A strong move. } Bb4 {Moving the bishop twice. } 13. Bd2 Bxc3 {?! gives up the bishop pair and strengthens whites center. } 14. bxc3 a6 15. c4 {To drive the N back, preparing to exploit greater space and the bishop pair.} Nb6 {?? This actually loses a piece after Ba5. Best was ...Nc7.} 16. Bc3 {? Missing Ba5. } Bd7 {? Best was ...Nd7, saving the piece and trying to force exchanges.} 17. Ba5 {! Finally. From now on Black is clearly lost. No way to save the N because if the Q moves the N is lost and otherwise c5 wins the N due to the pin.} Qc7 18. c5 {Winning the N.} Bb5 19. Qc2 Nfd7 20. Nxd7 Bxd7 21. Bxb6 {Winning the N and constricting Black further.} Qc6 22. Rad1 g6 {? Best not to voluntarily open the dark squares around the K when you are missing a DSB.} 23. Qe2 Rfe8 24. Qe5 {Whites plan is simple. Provoke weaknesses on the Kingside.} Rac8 25. Ba5 {Simplest. White brings the DSB back and is still prepared to bring the R up as well. Black can't afford to exchange, or not to exchange.} h6 26. Bc3 {Threatening d5 and mate.} Qc7 {Black tries to exchange Qs. } 27. Qe3 {No need to exchange, it is quicker to rake the Kingside which is undefended.} g5 {? Leads to a quick end, but Black had no counterplay.} 28. Qh3 {Threatens mate in two.} Qf4 {? Now White has a quick win...} 29. Qxh6 Bc6 30. d5 {! Obvious but deadly. Mate on g7 can only be deferred by giving up too much material. Black resigns.}
