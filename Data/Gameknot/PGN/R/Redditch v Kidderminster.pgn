1. d4 {So I start with the usual} e5 {Possibly the weakest move on the board. Black just gives up a pawn for virually nothing, except a few cheap tricks.} 2. dxe5 {So I take} Nc6 {He hits the pawn} 3. Nf3 {I protect} Qe7 {He hits it again.} 4. Qd5 {I thought if I play say Bf4 then he has Qb4+ and Qxb2, so I wanted to avoid that.} Nb4 {Hitting my queen, but not really helping his development.} 5. Qb3 {I had dreams of getting my Bf1 to c4 to hit f7.} Qc5 {Hitting my c2, but not really helping his development.} 6. Nc3 {So I block his attack} c6 {controlling b5 and d5, but he needs to develop} 7. e4 {So I carry on with my plan} d5 {So this was his idea} 8. exd6 e.p. {Perhaps simply e4xd5 was better.} Be6 {He hits my queen} 9. Qa4 {I have to stay on c2 of course.} b5 {He hits my queen again.} 10. Bxb5 {This is almost forced, but good! if now cxb5 11. Nxb5 Nxc2+ 12. Kd1 Nxa1 13. Nc7+ Kd8 14. Qe8# so he distracts my queen } Nxc2+ {I take, although Kd1 is also playable, I thought this was clearer.} 11. Qxc2 {So I take} cxb5 {He takes} 12. e5 {I secure d6, at the same time making his development hard.} b4 {I think this was the move he had been planning.} 13. Qe4 {But this shot saves the knight and leads me a clear two pawns up with a dominating position} Rb8 {So he moves the rook} 14. Na4 {I hit his queen} Qa5 {He hits the knight} 15. b3 {I protect} Bd7 {He hits the knight again} 16. Nb2 {I retreat, heading for c4} Qb5 {Preventing me from castling} 17. Nd4 {But I just hit his queen} Qa6 {H etreats along the diagonal} 18. Nc4 {and now my knights dominate} g6 {He tries to develop} 19. e6 {Crunch!} Nf6 {He hits my queen.} 20. exd7+ {I take the bishop} Kxd7 {He takes} 21. Qf4 {I hit his knight} Re8+ {He checks} 22. Ne5+ {I check back} Rxe5+ {He takes} 23. Qxe5 {I take back. He could resign with a clear conscience here, but he plays on to mate.} Bxd6 {He takes} 24. Qxf6 {I take} Re8+ {He  throws in a check. OK stop. What would you do in this position?} 25. Be3 {This is actually a mistake and gives him a chance to get off the hook. He could now play Rxe3+ 26. fxe3 Bg3+ 27. hxg3 Qxf6 and he is still in the game. I saw this after I played it, but kept my calm demeanour, and thankfully he didn't notice.} Qd3 {I am nto sure what exactly this threatens!} 26. Qxf7+ {So I pick up a pawn with check.} Re7 {He gets out of check} 27. Qc4 {I offer the exchange of queens.} Rxe3+ {He takes.} 28. fxe3 {I take back} Qxe3+ {He takes} 29. Ne2 {I block all queen checks. Many better positions have been resigned.} Bc5 {Threatening Qf7 check} 30. Rd1+ {I check} Ke7 {He moves out. I think Kc6 struggles on for longer, but it is hopeless.} 31. Rf1 {So I protect f2 and have a threat of my own.} a5 {Which he seems to miss} 32. Qf7# {1-0.
