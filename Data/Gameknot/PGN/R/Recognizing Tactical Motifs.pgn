[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Centre Counter, sometimes called the Scandinavian Defence - Scandy by its affectionate devotees.  Directly challenging White in the centre, but there is a bit of a downside.} 2. Nc3 {OK, but perhaps unnecessarily provocative.  Much more usual is 2.exd5 and if Black recaptures, 2...Qxd5, 3.Nc3 forces Black to move the Queen a second time.  I once won a game in four moves when Black thoughtlessly retreated his Queen to c6, whereat 4.Bb5 pinned his Q against his K.   Much more usual is 3...Qa5, which places the Q on a safe square, but still actively located.} d4 {Good response to White's threat to win the pawn.  Now the knight will have to move a second time.} 3. Nd5 {Although this encourages Black to hit him again, I think this is probably OK.  3.Ne2 may be met by 3...e5, when Black has the larger share of the centre.  That need not be fatal - more like the colours reversing roles!} e6 4. Nf4 e5 5. Bc4 {?  I can't tell whether this is a simple 'one-mover' oversight, or a reluctance to move the knight a fourth time.  It were better to have moved the knight a fourth time, and even a fifth - 5.Nh5 g5  6.Ng3.  However 5.Nd3 would have been OK too, threatening to win the e-pawn.} Nh6 {?  Taking the knight would have been fine for Black.} 6. Nd3 Bg4 {This is a mistake, but a bit of calculation is necessary to figure it out.  The sequence isn't deep, but it IS more than two moves.  The problem is that if the bishop's protector, the h6-knight, can be drawn from his post, he can be overwhelmed by numbers, with two pieces attacking the bishop and one defending.  It is a small combination.  See if you can find it.} 7. Ne2 {?  Rather awkward - White pieces are starting to get a bit tangled in the centre.  Recall the opening guideline - don't move a piece twice in the opening, unless there is a tactic.  Earlier, the knight was being hunted; it had to keep on the move.  Now there is a tactic: 7.Bxf7ch! Black has two reasonable replies: 7...Nxf7 8.Qxg4; OR 7...Kxf7 8.Nxe5ch ... (forking King on f7 and Bishop on g4) 8...Ke8 9.Nxg4 ... Either way, White wins a pawn with a slight advantage.} Bxe2 {Gives up an active piece for one relatively immobile (because it is pinned).  Not usually a good bargain.} 8. Qxe2 Be7 {?  Another 'one mover' oversight that costs Black a pawn.  8...Bd6 or 8...f6 or a move by the b8-knight would have been much better.} 9. Nxe5 {The Gameknot engine gives White a 1.88 edge - worth almost 2 pawns - very much the better game.} Bf6 10. Nd3 {Safe enough.  An alternative idea would have been to invite (force) an exchange of minor pieces by 10.Ng4.  Now that she is a pawn ahead, even (i.e. equal) exchanges are in White's interests, in principle.  That does NOT mean simply blindly exchange, of course, nor should Black avoid them if by so doing he incurs worse, but they can be used to add value to White material advantage.} O-O 11. e5 {!?  OK, but I think I would have castled, here.  White does have to be somewhat concerned about the tangled situation on the c- and d-files, too, though their unravelling is not yet urgent.} Be7 12. c3 Nc6 13. e6 {?!  Halves White's advantage according to the GK engine.  But I rather like this move - poking a heavy stick into Black's game.  It's a move I might well have played myself in this situation.} a5 {?!  The Gameknot engine prefers 13...Bd6, which places the bishop on a well protected and handier location - a more useful diagonal.} 14. exf7+ Nxf7 15. cxd4 {?  Understandable, given the tangled situation in White's centre, but this puts Black on top.  The recapture will throw White back onto the defensive.  It is not so easy to find a good move, but I might have been inclined to castle, or play 15.Bb3, with a view to relocating to c2, aiming at the h7-square.} Nxd4 16. Qd1 {Naturally, there was no good alternative.  Black was attacking the queen, and also c2, where there would have been a knight-fork.  This Queen retreat defends against both threats.} a4 {More forcing - and more worrying for White - would have been 16...b5.  Now White has the opportunity to exploit the pin along the a2-g8 diagonal.  } 17. O-O {At last, and quite understandable.  There will come times at this level of play in which quite complicated tactical situations can arise.  It is very hard to learn to recognise and take advantage of them without having begun with simpler, less complicated motifs and patterns.  The main thing to note is that the f7-knight is pinned by the bishop against the king.  It is defended by a rook and the king.  Could White heap another attacker against the pinned knight?  Yes she could: 17.Ne5!  Could Black in response find another defender?  Only the Queen.  What that means is that White looks to be winning the exchange after 17.Ne5.   ++++++++++++++  As it transpires, this might have led to a wild tactical melee as follows:  17.Ne5! Bd6!  18.Nxf7 Qe7ch (the reason for the bishop move) 19.Kf1 b4  (A piece and a pawn down, Black fights like a tiger to stay in the game) 20.Nh6ch! ... (As you see, this is well beyond 'one-mover' territory, and would be challenging for an experienced tactician to calculate.  Not 20.Nd6ch?? bxc4  21.Nxc4 Rxf2ch 22.Kxf2 Rf8ch  23.Kg1 Ne2ch and Black wins)  20...Kh8 21.Bd5 e6  22.Nf7ch Kg8  23.Qg4! Ne2 24.Be6 Rxf7  25.Rb1 Raf8  26.Bxf7ch Rxf7.  fen="6k1/4qrpp/2pb4/1p6/p5Q1/8/PPnP1PPP/1RB2K1R w - -" ++++++++++++++++ I would not expect anyone below Master level to calculate this whole line, so complicated it is.  Myself, I would have decided that something like 17.Ne5 b5  18,Bxf7ch Rxf7  19.Nxf7 Kxf7 won the exchange and left it at that.  I might well have been surprised by the tactical fight Black put up by 17...Bd6!  but 'them are the breaks'.   If you don't see a reason NOT to capture a thing, or win some other advantage, go for it.  If it turns out bad, you will learn to recognise the really unsafe captures. } Ra5 {Not a bad idea to bring the rook quickly into action.  Instead, 17...b5 would have forced White to exchange on f7.} 18. Nf4 {Of course, 18.Ne5 is no longer playable.} Rf5 19. Nd3 {By moving the knight out and back again, White loses two tempi with Black reaping the benefit.  'Admitting a mistake' in this way shows flexibility of mind, and, every now and then one has no alternative.  But it is far more often better to look for some way to extract value, even from a poor move.  As it happens, 18.Nf4 was not so bad a move at all.  White could now have played 19.Ne6, forcing the exchange of knights on e6 on account of the Q-R fork.  Play might have gone 19.Ne6 Nxe6  20.Bxe6 Re5 21.Bxf7ch!? ... (Possibly unnecessary) 21...Rxf7 22.Qxa4.  Balanced against White's extra two pawns would be Black's more active game, so the outcome would be uncertain! } c6 20. Qxa4 {I do recommend that, if you can see no reason NOT to take 'free' material, then take it.  But here the reason not to take it is immediate; another 'one-mover'.  Actually, on this occasion, once again it is more complicated than that.  But the real point is that White overlooked the double-attack - the pawn fork - in Black's reply.} b5 {Bang!  It so happens that White had a tactical means of getting out of this fork.  Complicating things, though, is the frenetic activity of Black's pieces, which renders even the escape problematic.} 21. Qa6 {?  This shows that White didn't 'see' 20....b5 in response to her taking the a-pawn.  Whenever you have two pieces a square apart in an advanced position you have to keep an eye out for pawn forks...  Any 'fork' really, as any piece can 'fork' such a pair, even a rook.   Instead, 21.Bxf7ch R8xf7  22.Qd1 ... is the immediate save, but then comes 22...Nf3ch! 23.gxf3 Qxd34 24.f4	Rxf4  with a powerful attack.  The GK engine gives 25.f3 Bc5+ 26.Kh1 Rxf3 27.Rxf3  Rxf3 28.Qb3+ Qxb3 29.axb3  Kf7 30.Kg2 Rxb3 31.Ra8 - an ending only a pawn down, but with an incarcerated bishop.  So even though the outlook would not have been promising after 21.Bxf7ch, it offered better prospects than this Queen move! } bxc4 22. Ne1 {White HAD to recapture the pawn: 22.Qxc4.} Ne5 {! Excellent play, bringing just about every Black piece into the action.    The attack that followed led to Black delivering mate on move 30.  Here it is without further comment.} 23. f3 Bh4 24. Qxc4+ {?? } Nxc4 25. Nd3 Rf8f6 {?! Overlooking mates in 6 or 7 moves in this and the next turn is really neither here nor there at this level.  The moves Black played were good enough to win comfortably.  You can win a game only once... } 26. b3 Rg6 {A piece sacrifice! Well played, even if not the best.} 27. bxc4 Nxf3+ {! } 28. Kh1 Qxd3 29. Rd1 Qe2 30. g3 {Even after 30.Rg1. Black had a forced mate in 3.}
