1. e4 c5 {Another Sicilian, just as in rounds 1 and 3, so... } 2. Nc3 {Another closed variation. } Nc6 {The main line. In round 1, my opponent played 2...a6 (resulting in a draw after a long fight) and in round 3 my opponent played 2...d6 (I won in 26 moves). } 3. f4 {The Grand Prix Attack, my main weapon against the Sicilian. } e6 4. Nf3 d6 {The development scheme Black chooses is similar to the Scheveningen. } 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. O-O {Typical development for White in the GPA. } Be7 7. d3 a6 {I was waiting for this move to be played before I would exchange my bishop for his knight. In the Grand Prix one should generally favour knights over bishops, because the position is quite closed (at least I assume that's the reason why White almost always exchanges his light-squared bishop for Black's knight after he's played Bb5). } 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. Qe1 {Another normal Grand Prix move, the queen aims to assist in a kingside attack from f2, g3 or h4. } Nf6 10. Kh1 {This was a waiting move to see if Black would already commit his king to the kingside, or how he would plan to attack. I admit, not one of the greatest moves I've ever made. But I didn't see a clear way to attack, so I just decided to consolidate my position. On 365chess.com I see that 10.Qg3 and 10.e5 are common in this position, moves which I both considered but of which I didn't see a clear merit. I also see that GM Epishin once had this position and played 10.b3, which is also the move suggested by the computer.} h6 {Apparently Black didn't quite know what to do either. Maybe he saw a dangerous kingside attack coming, but castling is simply better than this nothing-move. } 11. Qg3 {I saw a way to create another weakness in Black's kingside, so I went with it. } g6 {Now castling surely is dangerous, due to 12.f5 with the threat of 13.Bxh6. } 12. f5 {A pawn sac which Black probably shouldn't accept. Actually I think it's not a great move... } gxf5 13. exf5 e5 {And this is why. Black's king is completely safe in the centre of the board and Black's h-pawn is really not so weak, since I can't really take it as we will see later.} 14. Qh4 {'Attacking'... But what is my target? } Kd7 {!? The king had been standing there on e8 with nothing to do, so he decides to take a little walk to the queenside. I guess the idea is to let the rooks participate in an attack on the kingside. The computer suggests 14...Qd7. I was totally surprised by this move, of course. } 15. Qc4 {?! I feel there's nothing left to do on the kingside, so I switch my focus to the queenside. Obviously 15.Bxh6?? just loses the bishop due to the pin (15...Bf8). However, the queen is a bit misplaced here as well and does not have many squares. The computer suggests 15.Qe1, but it's clear that something has gone wrong with White's attack already and that Black is doing well. I felt during the game that I was stuck without a plan, but I thought I couldn't be worse due to the many pawn moves Black has made so far. But in a strange game as this one, those kind of guidelines don't count. } Qg8 {Now Black is the one attacking on the kingside, which should have been White's domain.} 16. Rg1 {A defensive move. I wanted to put my f3 knight on e4 (via d2) but I needed this rook move first to prevent the mate on g2. But better was 16.Ne4 which also unpins the knight. } Kc7 {I don't really understand this move, the king was totally safe on d7. The computer suggests 16...Qh7, probably with the plan of pushing the h-pawn and putting the a-rook on g8. I was down by almost half an hour on the clock: 45 minutes vs. 1 hour and 13 minutes (plus increment) for the next 24 moves. } 17. Nd2 {Continuing with my plan of putting the knight on e4, but better was 17.b4 to try and get some play on the queenside (I was thinking of that, but first wanted to get my knight in a good position). } Ng4 {Suddenly Black is threatening 18...Nf2#! } 18. Nde4 b5 {? Another pawn is pushed. However, the move is inferior to another pawn push: 18...f6. Then a queen exchange is forced (19.Qxg8 Raxg8, after which 20.Nd1 is forced because I need to defend f2 a 2nd time before Black can chase my other knight away with ...d5. } 19. Qb3 {? This was a good chance to free my position with 19.Nd5+! Bxd5 20.Qxd5, but I was not sure if 19.Nd5+ wouldn't lose a piece. After, say, 19...Kd8, my knight is only defended by the queen, which is in danger as well, but if I had looked more closely I could have seen that there was no way for black to take advantage of that fact because I can move my queen to b3 after which Black has no tactics to win the knight or the queen. Probably I went with the 'safe' option, because I didn't want to take too much time on this move as I already was foreseeing time trouble. } Bxe4 {? Black allows me to free my position on the queenside. Far better was 19...f6. } 20. Nxe4 Kc6 {Black's king is tired of staring at his own pieces and decides to take another step to watch the White army from a closer distance. Still he is completely safe at c6. However, White is 'threatening' to free his position with 21.c4, but Black can do nothing to prevent that move. The computer suggests to sacrifice a pawn with 20...Qd8. Apparently the threat of 21.c4 is so strong that such a move is needed to stop it. Maybe the idea of the king move is to make ...d5 possible. } 21. Re1 {? Too slow. With 21.c4, all of White's queenside pieces would suddenly spring to life and he would destroy Black's strong pawn falanx on that side of the board. I don't really understand why I didn't try to activate my queen, which is doing next to nothing on b3. } h5 {? I don't understand this one either. Black should stop c4 with 21...d5. I don't see any coherent plan in Black's moves. } 22. Nc3 {? I was now thinking of moving my queen or knight to d5, but still I didn't look at 22.c4 which is still a great move. } f6 {Black decides on a queen exchange. I can't really avoid it, not because 23.Qa3 loses a piece to 23...b4 (I can play 24.Qa4+) but just because a3 is an even more  horrible place for the queen than b3. Note, by the way, that Black has pushed all of his 8 pawns at least once in this game. He has now made 11 pawn moves and 3 king moves (White has only made 5 pawn moves. Still, Black is clearly better in this position, although I still couldn't believe that during the game. } 23. Qxg8 Raxg8 24. h3 {Finally I chase that threatening knight away and give my king some air to breathe. } Nh6 25. Bxh6 {I exchange, because my bishop couldn't really do anything useful with such a closed pawn falanx. I also thought my knight would be superior to his currently useless bishop in the endgame. Was this the right thing to do? I think so. } Rxh6 26. Ne4 {?! targeting the weak pawns at d6 and f6, but if I had looked for one second at Black's possible replies, I would not have made this move. I even offered a draw here, thinking the pawn structure was totally closed so no-one could do anything useful with it. The problem was that I was already running low on time (I had some 15 minutes) so I still didn't assess the position correctly and I didn't take time to analyze possible replies, as mentioned earlier. } d5 {This is such an obvious move... I don't know how I could have missed this one. } 27. Nd2 Bd6 {OK, but also very strong was 27...h4, cramping White's kingside completely, as suggested by the computer. But this move doesn't give away much of Black's advantage. Clock times: 15 minutes for me, 35 for Black.} 28. Re2 c4 29. Rc1 {Aligning my rook with the king on the c-file, but it's unrealistic to think Black is ever going to open it up by trading pawns (probably I thought he would because it would weaken my d-pawn). } Rh7 30. Nf3 {Here I offered a draw again, still wondering how my position could be worse. The problem is that I just have so little space and Black can do whatever he wants because White can hardly break out. } h4 31. Rd1 cxd3 {Now that the rook has moved off the c-file, this exchange is OK. } 32. Rxd3 {?! I could get back my pawn in a much better way: 32.Red2!. If 32...dxc2? I still win the pawn back with 33.Rxc2+ Kb6 (33...Bc5?? 34.Rdc1 and Black loses a bishop) 34.Rxd5. Now my rooks are misplaced. } Rh5 33. Red2 {? An unnecessary mistake (I had seven minutes on the clock). It closes off the escape route for my rook. } d4 {Very good was 33...e4. It doesn't win any material (I can save both pieces with 34.Nd4+ Kb6 35.Rb3) but it's still a very strong move since my position gets even more cramped and Black is in total control of the game. I did see the move just after I had played my 33th move. } 34. c3 {! Finally I make a pawn move to try and free my position a bit. } Rxf5 {? A blunder. I had seen that 34...e4? wouldn't work anymore due to 35.Nxd4+!, but this move is maybe even worse.} 35. cxd4 {?? But right at the moment that I could really have freed my position and got an advantage, I make the decisive mistake. With the beautiful 35.Rxd4! I finally get out of the bind that I have been in for the last 20 moves. 35...exd4? fails to 36.Nxd4+ forking king and rook, but if Black doesn't take he has simply lost a pawn and let White free his position.} e4 {? I had actually seen this one coming before I played my move, but I thought I could get out of it. It was only now that I realized that Black has another trick up his sleeve at the end of this line... } 36. Rc3+ Kb6 37. Nh2 Bb4 {... And this is it. White loses the exchange and with it the game. } 38. d5 {My only trump is the passed d-pawn, but it's not going to do any damage to Black.} Bxc3 39. bxc3 Rg7 {More precise was 39...Rg3, when the d-pawn will immediately fall, for example 40.Rd1 Rd3 41.Re1 Rfxd5 etc.} 40. d6 Kc6 41. Ng4 Rd7 42. Ne3 Rc5 {But here d6 is still going to fall and then c3 is doomed as well, so I decided I had seen enough and resigned this game. I had had my chances, but overall Black was better in this game, assessed his position better and deserved to win it. A disappointing start of the second half of this tournament... Still 3 games to go. Will I get over this?}
