1. e4 {I start off with my favorite and also my strongest opening as this is the first I learned. (Kings pawn-Kings Indian)} e5 {He responds King pawn} 2. Nf3 {Knight to f3} d6 {black moves pawn to d6} 3. d3 {I move pawn to d3} Nc6 {Black knight c6} 4. Nc3 {As I am playing I think to myself that I should have moved this to d2 instead by all goes well I believe.} a6 {Black moves a6} 5. g3 {I get ready to feinchetto my bishop..Hope I spelled it correctly : ) Edit: sorry "Fianchetto"} Nf6 {black knight f6....almost a split image so far...I think I have almost completed my fav kings indian attack maybe except for the misplaced knight on c3..not sure this is right but everything is smooth so far} 6. Bg2 {bishop g2} Bg4 {He pins my knight. Not much to worry about I figure.} 7. O-O {so I simply castle} Nd4 {This is why I think I made a mistake with Nc3 instead of pawn c3} 8. Be3 {But I quickly figure a way to counter} Ne6 {He retreats his knight} 9. Nd5 {and I figure this will solve my initial problem so that I can further move up my pawns> what do you all think?} h6 {He protects g5 which kind of causes problems for me in the future but also helps in the future as you will see.} 10. Nxf6+ {I take his knight on f6. good move?} Qxf6 {He retakes with queen to f6} 11. c3 {I prepare for my pawn push towards the center to gain control.} O-O-O {I think black's mistake here is castling instead of developing more pieces. What do you think?} 12. d4 {So i continue to push to d4} d5 {black pawn to d5 stopping me.} 13. dxe5 {Now I can take also attacking black queen.} Qg6 {Black queen moves to g6} 14. exd5 {I continue the simple pawn push also taking his pawn on d5 at the same time attacking knight on e6} Ng5 {I force black knight to move.} 15. d6 {Again moving my pawn up to d6 I have now dominate center control. Are these good moves I am making? or is my opponent just making mistakes? I am not sure.} c6 {I think black should have taken my pawn here but moved to c6} 16. Qd4 {I un pin the knight from f3 also attacking black bishop on g4 and perhaps controlling the entire board at this point. } Bd7 {He retreats bishop to d7} 17. Nh4 {I attack blacks queen by moving knight to h4} Qe6 {queen retreat to e6} 18. f4 {at this point I think I am in the zone and Im coming at him from all angles. Probably due to my better developed pieces and great central control. anyway I attack his knight.} Nh3+ {He moves to h3 check and then I take.} 19. Bxh3 {bishop takes on h3} Qxh3 {He retakes my bishop but now queen is kind of stuck in this position while I attack further.  Edit: Thanks everyone Qa7 and Qb6 would make this game much shorter but I did not see these moves during play. sry} 20. f5 {So continue the pawn game. f5} f6 {black pawn f6} 21. e6 {My pawns are defending each other very well as the move up the board. I am now attacking bishop on d7} g5 {instead of moving He attacks my knight on h4} 22. Ng6 {But I make a cunning dash to Ng6 forking his bishop and Rook} Rg8 {Rook to g8} 23. exd7+ {I take his bishop.} Rxd7 {Rook retakes.} 24. Qxf6 {my queen takes a pawn on f6} Bxd6 {He takes my undefending pawn. He shouldve have used his rook instead. That would have forced my queen to move and taking my knight. Bad move by black.} 25. Qe6 {I threaten his d7 and g8 rook at the same time.} Qg4 {and he tries to get his queen out of a hole but I think this is bad timing.} 26. Qxg8+ {I take rook on g8 and checking.} Kc7 {King ducks down in c7 I try and figure a way to mate as black is lost from here.} 27. b4 {So I push up my pawn towards the king. Do you see another move?} Qe4 {Black queen attacks my bishop on e3} 28. Rfe1 {So I defend by rook to fe1} Qf3 {This was either a mistake or a bad move.} 29. c4 {I continue to push my pawns closer to the king. } Bxb4 {Dont know how I didnt see this but it doesn't matter at this point.} 30. Rab1 {This is the move I really wanted.} Bxe1 {ouch! didn't see that either... too busy looking for mate I guess. but doesnt matter.} 31. Bb6+ {I check b6} Kd6 {King to d6} 32. Qf8+ {queen to f8 check. Its over from here.} Re7 {Rook to e7 blocking the queen. but because of well positioned knight on g6 queen can take here for checkmate.} 33. Qxe7# {And that is game! Thanks for watching. this is one of my best games I have ever played. I would say near perfect besides the mistakes I made near the end. If you see any other mistakes I made or Black made during the game please share. I have been playing chess now for a couple months and I am improving thanks to all of your comments. Maybe I can play some of you great players in the future. thanks for watching my game. Hope you enjoyed it.   edit: Thanks damalfi, but what is GK games?}
