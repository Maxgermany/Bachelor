1. e4 {my standard king pawn opening. vienna possible is in the making} e5 {deadlocking the center........vienna time} 2. Nc3 {Vienna!} Nf6 {standard vienna opening} 3. Nf3 {no capablanca Bc4 today} d5 {center attack version} 4. d3 {defending the center, missing Nxe5 here} d4 {advance!} 5. Ne2 {retreating,blocks in my bishop ensnaring it in a self inflicted trap. so far so good for the X Machine} Bg4 {pinning,and ow......almost......} 6. Nxe5 {A saving grace in the making St.KnightsBurg lives!} Bd6 {Persecution from a revenge seeking bishop!} 7. Nxg4 {Death to the bishop of pinnimere Bay!} Nxg4 {The death of a saint} 8. Nxd4 {Discovered attack!} Qf6 {good counter attack, at first appears to be a blunder, but is really genius in the making} 9. Nf5 {brilliant response if i do say so myself} Nc6 {developmental move, choice of castles in Quebec and Kazakhstan, only problem what about the G Knight?} 10. Qxg4 {Gulp.......Swallow.........burp. Knights taste funny. the machine man resigns here, down 5 material points. good game, x-machine. Earlier i said this was the last of 2 games between us. that is not true. shortly following the machine offered a revenge match against me. i eagerly accepted and so far it's getting interesting. Apparently that bishop who  is still alive at the end of this game is wanting a bit more action against the queen and company. {grin} good luck X in game 3. so far 2-0 me. Until next time this is The Warrior signing off}
