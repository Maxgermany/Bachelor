[Opening "Petrov three knights game (C42)"]

1. e4 {Hi all! Annotating this game on a request from chicoboy, who was playing the White pieces. A bloody opening leaves only Rooks and a couple minor pieces left on the board, and each player misses a couple important safety checks in the dangerous mid-end game, which their opponents are happy to capitalize on. Enjoy!} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 {Petrov's Three Knights' Game. This can easily transpose to an equal (if perhaps dull) Four Knights' Game with 3...Nc6, or stay the Petrov line with 3...Bb4 (where Black will get his e-pawn back without much trouble if White cares to take it) and fighting chances.} d6 {This is more reserved than 3...Bb4, but certainly playable. It has the disadvantage of blocking the KB somewhat, but with this move Black reinforces his center and prepares to play ...Be7 and either ...Bg4 or ...Be6.} 4. Bc4 {Good, solid development. Also possible was an immediate 4.d4! with a nice gain of space for White. Note that Bc4 doesn't really prevent Black from playing ...Be6, as after 5.Bxe6 fxe6 the half-open f-file could prove more troublesome for White than for Black.} Be7 5. d3 {This is a solid move; White bolsters his center and frees his QB, but I prefer 5.d4! Black can do nothing to prevent White from claiming the extra space, and therefore freedom of movement, afforded by d2-d4, so White may as well play it.} O-O 6. d4 {?! Okay, now this is strange. Why take two moves to play d2-d4? There's no good reason. I give this a ?! rather than a straight ? because the d4 thrust is a good idea; it just should have been played at once. Better options were probably 6.O-O or 6.Be3, simply continuing development.} Bg4 {Black's moves continue to be straightforward and logical. Another possibility worth a look was the immediate 6...exd4!? where Black maintains the initiative after White retakes and may play ...Nc6 or ...c5 at his leisure.} 7. dxe5 dxe5 {?! I think this is probably a mistake; Black now cannot avoid the loss of a pawn. Probably 7...Bxf3 8.Qxf3 dxe5 was a better move order, as now White can break the pin with tempo. So, Black is the first to miss a quick safety check, and the balance swings in White's favor.} 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. O-O {? It remains to be seen whether the weakened pawn structure White inherits (after Bxf3 gxf3) will severely impact his game, but regardless, he should simply have played 9.Nxe5 and taken the free pawn. Missing the clearly correct choice, White shunts the advantage off to the Black side of the board.} Bxf3 {Not bad, though I like 9...Nc6 here a little more (developing and threatening ...Nd4 if the Nf3 moves).} 10. gxf3 Nc6 11. Nd5 {This is a strong move, essentially forcing Black to trade off his KN to get rid of White's powerful, active Knight.} Nxd5 12. exd5 {This, however, is not so strong. By retaking with the pawn rather than the Bishop, White isolates his doubled f-pawns and limits the Bishop's scope. 12.Bxd5 would keep the Bishop active and put pressure on both f7 and b7, as well as preventing an eventual ...e4 push from Black.} Nd4 {Strong, forking the f3 and c2 pawns.} 13. c3 {? Black was going to pick up a free pawn anyway; better was to either develop with 13.Be3 or make Black choose between the check and the material while trying to get rid of the doubled pawn on good terms with 13.f4!?} Nxf3+ 14. Kh1 g6 {? The only reason for this is because of the eventual threat of Rg1, but White has no attacking prospects right now, so instead Black is simply inviting the White Bishop to invade h6.} 15. Bh6 {White happily obliges.} Bd6 {Setting up more pressure on h2.} 16. Be2 e4 17. Bxf3 {This is best, I think. White loses the Bishop pair but he needed to neutralize the kingside Black pawns.} exf3 18. Rae1 {Seizing the open file. Trapping the f-Rook behind the pawn is ugly, but there's not much else to be done for it, though 18.Rad1 was probably worth a look (despite giving up control of the e-file).} Bc5 {This is the reason White moved the a-Rook instead of the f-Rook. If 18.Rfe1? Bc5 and White must drop another pawn.} 19. Be3 {? This is simply a mistake. Best was 19.b4, and if 19...Bb6?! 20.c4 holds the pawn. Another simple check missed; another pawn lost.} Bxe3 {This actually gives White his pawn back, if he cares to take it: 19...Bxe3 20.Rxe3 Rxd5 21.Rxf3, though it puts the White Rooks in an awkward and somewhat helpless position. Regardless, 19...Rxd5 was the better choice, preparing for ...Rad8. With this, Black hands over some of the advantage he's gained, giving White the chance pick up good Rook positioning in exchange for the pawn.} 20. Rxe3 Rxd5 21. Rfe1 {Doubled Rooks on the open file. I think this is quite a bit stronger than 21.Rxf3, as I mentioned earlier. The f1 Rook really needed activation, and White needs to retain control of the e-file. However, it's worth mentioning that White must take f3 before he can go on the offensive, since otherwise Black threatens a simple back-rank mate at any moment.} Rd2 22. Rxf3 {This is good now, as White retains the e-file and now threatens 23.Re7 with a surprisingly strong attack. Both players are playing solidly now.} Rxb2 {? Black is in a very aggressive mindset and is thinking only about clearing off all the pawns, but safeguarding his position with 22...Kf8 was a better choice, as now White has access to e7. Advantage White.} 23. a4 {? 23.Re7! was much better. White doesn't need the a-pawn when he has two Rooks so active--especially compared to Black's miserable Rook still on a8! Black now has the chance to correct his earlier mistake.} c6 {This could be worse, as it forestalls White's material gains from Re7, but 23...Kf8 was still a much better choice, preventing White from reaching e7 in the first place.} 24. Re7 Rf8 25. Kg1 {Fine, though 25.Kg2 is more to the point. The Kings are weapons now for sure, they should both be making their way towards the action.} a6 26. h4 b5 27. h5 {?! White is trying to sacrifice the h-pawn to blow open the BK's position, but Black can simply not take it and play 27...bxa4 instead. Probably 27.Ra7 was better with an attempt to preserve the material White has left, though it's not looking good for him. He's certainly not out of it yet, though--Black's tragic f8 Rook is still practically not even participating, which continues to give White a fighting chance.} bxa4 28. c4 {Necessary to prevent 28...a3.} Rb3 {Black, with a significant material lead, now seeks simplification.} 29. Kg2 {29.Rxb3 axb3 30.Rb7 probably deserves a look, too, but White is running out of options to stop Black from queening.} Rxf3 30. Kxf3 Rb8 {This is an interesting choice. Black cuts off the WK's access to the a-file and prepares to interpose his Rook if White plays Re3 or Re2.} 31. h6 {!? With this move White has effectively given up on playing against the Black pawns--now he is clearly just hoping to be able to coax Black off the back rank, so White can deliver mate on e8. This is actually a very important move--White could resign here; the game is essentially lost at this point. However, setting traps when behind and playing for victory no matter what is part of what makes the game so much fun. White sees a chance for counterplay--no matter how unlikely--and sticks with it.} Rb3+ {?! Honestly, this kind of move just makes me worried. Black's technically still safe because it's check, but White is now threatening mate and Black will have to burn another move to prevent it. I would have played 31...f5, just so I wouldn't have to worry about the WR mating me while I queened.} 32. Kg2 {I probably would have played 32.Kf4 (thinking to invade the Black kingside via g5 and f6 after Black plays 32...f5), but this is fine.} a3 {??? Black falls into the most nefarious trap of them all! Black misses his safety check for the last time, thinking presumably that White ought to be resigning and just intent on getting his Queen and putting the game to rest. In other words, exactly what White had hoped to achieve. Spotting his mistake just barely too late, Black resigns. Thanks for reading!}
