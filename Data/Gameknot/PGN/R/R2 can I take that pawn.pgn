[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A46)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 {Probably my opponent wants to avoid some lines (like the Budapest gambit) and plays 2.Nf3 instead of 2.c4.} c5 {I like to play the Benko against 1.d4 openings, so I continue with my normal 2...c5.} 3. e3 {Unfortunately it won't be a Benko Gambit. This move is somewhat passive as it blocks in the dark-squared bishop, but if White wants to avoid main lines and still wants to play c4 at some point, this is a logical move.} d5 {I decide to stake a claim in the center as well. Now it's a sort of reversed queen's gambit declined, but it can still transpose into other lines.} 4. c4 cxd4 {I could play 4...e6, transposing into a sideline of the Tarrasch defence to the QGD, but I don't know that opening so I decided to play different and try to avoid book lines...} 5. exd4 Nc6 {Putting pressure on the d4 pawn, which will be the main theme of this game.} 6. Nc3 {Believe it or not, but this game has transposed into a Caro-Kann, Panov-Botvinnik attack. Compare it with the variation 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Nf3... It's the same position. I don't play the Caro-Kann and didn't recognize the position, and my opponent was not aware of it either I think, as he took much time to think at each move.} Bg4 {More pressure on d4. But the question is: 'Can I take that pawn, or not?' I tried to calculate many moves in advance and already saw the game position at move 10.} 7. Be3 {More defence for the pawn. By the way, the main continuation is 7.cxd5.} Bxf3 {? Exchanging a defender of d4 for a piece that doesn't directly attack it. I decided to go for the pawn, as I couldn't see a clear refutation (yet). Even though I did see that White would get a development advantage, I didn't think it would be enough compensation for the pawn. The variation was too long for me to see White's winning move at move 11. Note that this move in itself does not lose the game, but the plan behind it does.} 8. Qxf3 dxc4 {Clearing the d-file for my queen.} 9. Bxc4 Nxd4 {?? Played quickly (too quickly?). Probably if I would have calculated now, I would have seen White's winning move. But it's very hard to 'admit' that you have made a mistake, and I kind of felt that there was no way back at this point. If I would not take this pawn now, I would have lost the bishop pair and given White a development advantage for free. But anything's better than giving him the win.} 10. Bxd4 Qxd4 11. Bb5+ {! This wins. When I looked at this position at move 6, I thought about 11.Qxb7 and wanted to reply with 11...Rd8 'with threats to the exposed White king' (at first I actually thought it was a mating threat on d2 as I still had the bishop on f1 in my head). Of course, 12.Bb5+ would also refute that variation (even if the Bishop were really on f1), but as said before, the variation was too long to calculate.} Nd7 {11...Kd8 fails to 12.Rd1 winning the queen, or also 12.Qxb7 with a huge attack.} 12. O-O {12.Qxb7 was better and simpler, but White is still winning. Maybe he didn't see that after 12...Rb8?? 13.Qxb8# is mate due to the pin on the knight. Also winning is 12.Bxd7+ Kxd7 13.Qxb7+ winning the rook on a8, or 13.Rd1 winning the queen.} O-O-O {The best defence according to the computer because it unpins the knight, But White is still winning at least a piece.} 13. Rac1 Qe5 {I saw the threat of 14.Ne2+ winning the queen and I saw that 13...Kb8 would simply lose the knight on d7 after 14.Rfd1. I also calculated a line with 13...Nc5, which went 14.Na4 b6 (only one to defend the knight) 15.Ba6+ Kc7 16.Qb7+ Kd6 and Here I thought 17.Rfd1?? would win the Black queen, not seeing that the White queen was also attacked. But at all moves of that variation White has many alternatives which all win. But it does not matter what I play here, as I'm lost in all variations.} 14. Rfe1 {And now I'm losing the queen anyway (14...Qc7 and 14...Qb8 fail to 15.Nd5(+) and 14...Qd6 and 14...Qc5 fail to 15.Ne4(+)). Moreover, White keeps an enormous advantage in activity. Therefore, I decided that I had seen enough and resigned. Quite a painful loss for me, but fortunately I had almost a day to recover, an advantage of playing one game a day. An interesting question that arises after seeing this game is: 'How to cope with variations that are very long and hard to calculate correctly?' There are, in my view, at least three solutions. The first is to keep calculating until you have come to a clear-cut conclusion, but that's often not possible (due to time restrictions, for example). The second solution is to just play it and see what happens, which is what I did in this game, but that can lead to a quick disaster, as happened here. A third solution could be to assess the risk of the variation, and if you find it too risky, just not play it. In this case I could have seen that White would have 3 pieces developed against only one for me (an exposed queen which could be attacked easily), and that my king cannot castle and won't be able to castle safely in less than three moves (the e- or g-pawn had to be moved and the bishop and knight be brought out). If you have any other ideas, please leave a comment. I would like to read your views on this. Thank you again for reading this annotation, hope you enjoyed it.}
