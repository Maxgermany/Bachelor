1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nc6 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. O-O f6 {Up to this point the game has been progressing along the lines of the French advance position (C02).  Black deviates from the main lines with this attack on the e pawn.  } 8. exf6 {White then captures to open the e file for his rook.  This will allow white to really build an attack with multiple pieces on the center of the board.  With Black's king stuck in the center and now missing the f pawn to support the king a well played attack could unravel Black's stronger position.} Nxf6 9. Bxc6 {White is looking to remove the Knight and to strand the a pawn.} bxc6 10. Re1 {Begins his strong attack on the center.} Qc8 {Black now must build his defense of the e pawn.} 11. Qe2 Kf7 {This move is the only one that will save the exchange on e6.} 12. Bg5 {White brings another piece into the attack.} Be7 13. Nd2 {White is looking to move this knight to f3 and then e5.  It will take a while to develop this piece but it also allows White to bring his remaining rook into the fray.} Re8 14. Nd2f3 Kg8 15. Ne5 Ne4 {White has not reached a point where all this pieces are attacking and must now make some exchanges.} 16. Bxe7 Rxe7 17. f3 Ng5 18. h4 c5 19. Nxd7 Qxd7 20. hxg5 cxd4 21. Qe5 Rc8 22. Rac1 Qa4 23. Qd6 Rce8 24. a3 Qb5 25. b4 {This is a massive blunder for White.  Black now has the opportunity to move Qa4 which attacks both the c and a pawns.  Given White's position, he can only protect one of these two pieces and when Black captures one of these pawns that remaining pawns will soon fall.} Qb6 26. Qxb6 {White takes the opportunity to exchange the queens and push to move to an end game where Blacks a pawn (soon to be b pawn) and center pawns are not as strong as White's structure.} axb6 27. Rcd1 e5 28. Rd2 Kf7 29. Rde2 b5 30. g3 g6 31. Kg2 Kg7 32. f4 e4 33. Rd1 d3 34. cxd3 exd3 35. Rxe7+ Rxe7 36. Rxd3 Rd7 37. Kf3 Kf7 38. Rd1 Ke6 39. Re1+ Kd6 {A better move would have been Rc1 allowing the rook to move to c5 attacking the two pawns.  One of these would then fall and possibility create two passed pawns on a and b.  The White king is still in positions to prevent the d pawn from scoring if Black just pushes past White's rook.} 40. Rc1 Ra7 41. Rc3 d4 42. Rb3 Kd5 43. Ke2 Kc4 44. Rf3 Rd7 45. Kd2 d3 46. g4 Rd4 47. Rf2 {(Look at f5 instead)} Kb3 48. f5 Kxa3 49. f6 Rd8 50. f7 Rf8 51. Kxd3 Kxb4 52. Kd4 Ka3 53. Ke5 b4 54. Ke6 b3 55. Ke7 Rc8 56. f8=Q Rxf8 57. Kxf8 b2 58. Rxb2 Kxb2 59. Kg7 Kc3 60. Kxh7 Kd4 61. Kxg6 Ke5 62. Kh7 Ke6 63. g6 Kf6 64. g7 Ke6 65. g8=Q+ Kf6 66. g5+ Kf5 67. g6 Kf4 68. Qe8 Kf3 69. g7 Kg3 70. g8=R+ Kh4 71. Qe4+ Kh3 72. Qh1# {}
