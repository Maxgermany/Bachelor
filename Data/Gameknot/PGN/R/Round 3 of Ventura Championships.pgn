1. e4 {I am Black. I played this at the Ventura Championships about six months ago, and won a five foot tall 2nd place trophy.} c5 2. Nf3 e6 {This is Black's most flexible way to play the Sicilian. Other Sicilian moves like d6, Nc6, or g6 give White more of an idea of what the plan is.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {Nf6 was the main move, and White can't play e5 because of Qa5 , but I preferred to play a more passive flexible setup.} 5. Be3 g6 {Not the best move. I am playing too passive by moving too many pawns, while White is developing and gaining space. } 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 b5 {I attack the bishop with tempo while preparing to fianchetto my light bishop.} 8. Bb3 Bb7 {I am threatening to play b4, driving the knight away from the defense of the e-pawn.} 9. f3 {Stops my threat.} d5 {A positional blunder. You should never open up the position when you are behind in development. I wasn't happy with my terrible opening, but I liked my nice win at the end.} 10. exd5 exd5 {White is good here, because I have an isolated d-pawn, which I could lose if I don't defend it properly.} 11. Qe2 {White reminds me of my vulnerable king in the centre.} Ne7 {I stop White's cheap threat of Bg5  winning my queen.} 12. Qd2 {A wasted tempo. I thought 12. Bg5 was better because it stops me from castling, and if I play 12...f6, then White has Ne6!} O-O {My king is now safe, but my position is still bad because I'm about to lose my d-pawn since it can't be defended by a pawn.} 13. Bh6 {White wants to trade his bishop for my only real active piece.} Re8 14. O-O-O {White probably didn't want any annoying discovered checks.} Bxd4 {I didn't like trading my good bishop, but my position is very passive and I needed a plan to uncramp my position.} 15. Qxd4 Nf5 16. Qd2 {Qf4 also defends the bishop.} d4 {My pawn is under heavy fire, so I must advance it to avoid losing it right away. Although I will probably lose it anyway.} 17. Bg5 Qd7 18. Ne2 Nc6 19. g4 {My pawn is attacked three times and defended three times, so all White has to do is drive away one of my defenders to win the pawn.} Ng7 20. Nxd4 Nxd4 21. Qxd4 Qxd4 22. Rxd4 {Now I'm down a pawn, and White's pieces are still active, but I won this game using my superior endgame knowledge and taking advantage of an overlooked tactic.} Ne6 {22...Bxf3 is bad because 23. Rf1 skewers my bishop and my f7-pawn.} 23. Bxe6 {Forced.} Rxe6 24. Rf1 {Defends the pawn.} Rae8 {Now I'm starting to come back, because my pieces are slightly more active. But I'm still a pawn short.} 25. h4 Kg7 {Preparing to get my king in the centre for the endgame.} 26. Rd3 {White probably doesn't know what to do in this position. To win in endgames, you MUST have active pieces. In the opening, active pieces don't matter as much because there are so many other pieces defending your position. Endgames are known for having a lot of loose pieces, so piece activity is important.} Re6e2 {My position is becoming more active now.} 27. Rd2 Re2e1+ 28. Rd1 {Taking my rook will lose the f3 and g4 pawns.} Rxf1 {A good trade, because White has an active rook.} 29. Rxf1 h6 30. Bd2 Re2 31. Bc3+ Kh7 32. h5 {I can play gxh5 gxh5 Rh2 winning my pawn back, but White can play f4 and activate his rook, while my rook will be less active from taking the pawn. And White's pawns are weak, so I'm still likely to win one. I just shouldn't do it too soon.} Rh2 33. hxg6+ Kxg6 {I'm still going to win back my pawn, because I can double attack his f3 pawn, and if he advances it, attack his g4 pawn. This will probably be a draw, because our bishops are of opposite color, but White gets greedy on the next move and tries to save his extra pawn.} 34. Bd2 {He thinks he has saved his pawn because in opposite colored bishop endgames, pawns are safe on the same color as your own bishop, so White wants to relocate his pawns to dark squares with f4 and g5, but doesn't notice that he has taken away his king's escape square.} Bxf3 {Bd2 was a blunder. White should've just played f4 and let me win his g4 pawn, because he should be able to draw the game because of the opposite colored bishops, but now he is losing because I have forced a bishop trade. The reason Black must take, is because his g4 pawn is on a light square and can't be defended by his bishop, the beauty of opposite colored bishop endings. } 35. Rxf3 Rh1+ 36. Be1 Rxe1+ 37. Kd2 {Even though the bishops are gone, I can stil try for an attempt to win White's weak g4 pawn, because my king is closer than his. } Re4 38. Ra3 {White knows he won't be able to save his g-pawn, so he attacks my a-pawn.} Re6 {Trading my a-pawn for his g-pawn is terrible, because it leaves me with a weak b-pawn, and his king is closer.} 39. Rf3 f6 {I safeguard my f-pawn before I proceed to attack with my king.} 40. Kc3 {White wants to attack my queenside because that's where he has a pawn majority, but he should be heading for the kingside because I am already in the process of advancing my kingside pawn majority. Very important in endgames.} Kg5 {40...Re4 was much better because it wins faster. I overlooked White's 41st move.} 41. Rh3 {Attacks my only weak pawn.} Re4 42. Rh5+ {The only way to save his pawn.} Kg6 43. Rh4 {White offered me a draw in this position, thinking that he has successfully stopped me from advancing my majority, but I declined his offer knowing I had a winning position due to his near death g-pawn.} Kg7 {Paradoxically, retreating my king is the way to win this endgame, because it lets me play f5, without getting checked.} 44. Kd3 {White realizes he has to stop my majority somehow, but he is too late.} Ra4 {I safeguard my rook while keeping control of the 4th rank, needed to win White's g-pawn.} 45. a3 f5 {This move is simply winning, the rest of the game need no comments because it shows how simple it is to win a rook-pawn endgame when you have passed pawns on the edge of the board, and your opponent cannot advance their own majority.} 46. Rh1 fxg4 47. Ke3 Kg6 48. Kf2 h5 49. Kg3 Kg5 50. Rh2 Rf4 51. b3 Rf3+ 52. Kg2 h4 53. Rh1 h3+ 54. Kg1 Kh4 55. Kh2 g3+ 56. Kg1 h2+ 57. Kg2 Rf2# {Checkmate! White could've stalled the game longer if he had taken my pawn on move 57, but with my extra rook and passed pawn, winning would still be simple. White's losing mistake this game was trying to stop me from advancing my pawn majority. He should've tried advancing his own majority on the queenside, so that it would be a race to see whose majority advances faster. Remember that in endgames you MUST have active pieces, not defensive pieces trying to stop a pawn majority.}
