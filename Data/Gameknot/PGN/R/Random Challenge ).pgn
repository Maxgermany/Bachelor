1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {The first Sveshnikov I've had on Gameknot (my favourite opening) and it's been very much overdue} 6. Nb3 Bb4 7. Bd2 {This isn't a move I've had before making me think that it is indeed simply the loss of a pawn  (after checking this over with chessbase after the match, Bd2 scores 8.7% for White from 23 games, not exactly inspiring)} Bxc3 8. Bxc3 Nxe4 9. Qg4 {If instead Bxe5 then Nxe5, Qe2, 0-0, Qxe4, Re8 leaves White caught in a horrible discovered attack} Ng5 10. h4 Ne6 {Black's knight looks a bit funny but actually fights for the centre quite well. The only problem will be developing the light-squared bishop which is worth a pawn and the centre and then some} 11. O-O-O {9/10 times castling quenside is a way to get butchered in the Sveshnikov and this proves to be no exception. Normally the bishop on e6 is a factor into this but really the Black control of the centre means that he is the only one who can ever realistically build up a successful attack} O-O 12. h5 d5 13. h6 g6 {It looks a bit risky to play this move with the mate themes on g7 and lack of a dark-squared bishop but the Black pieces make it very hard for White Queen to approach and the dark-squared bishop is frozen out by the centre pawns. The only way White can utilise the advanced h pawn to his advantage will be to get the f pawn in support or break up the centre which there wont be time to do} 14. Qf3 d4 15. Bb5 Bd7 16. Bxc6 Bxc6 17. Qg3 {Qe2 had been the expected move but g3 is fine as well. In this sort of position if a side is making defensive moves they are normally struggling but the key point is that Black can make these moves without conceding tempo. For example Bd7 forced White to take action concerning the attack on c3 and now Qc7 makes White go on the defensive without building up his attack at the same time. This all comes from Black's pieces being better placed and coordinated to combine attack and defense} Qc7 18. Bb4 Rfc8 19. Rd2 {Kb1 looked more sensible} Be4 20. Na1 {When your knight is retreating to the corner something has probably gone wrong...} a5 21. Re1 {Ba3 was no good either as after b5 the Black attack is going to run through very very quickly} f5 {Looks a bit risky but the calculation is there to back it up. Black doesn't want to concede the centralised bishop and lose the e pawn if he can help it so the forcing line as in the game occurs} 22. f3 f4 {This was the move. Now both Qg4 and Qh3 can be met with Bf5 and then Black can resume his attack} 23. Qh4 axb4 {This perhaps isn't the best move, Bd5 may be more accurate but I could see the breakthrough was still good for m even if it doesn't win mass material and it's definitely the simplest win} 24. Rxe4 Rxa2 25. Nb3 Nc5 {And White's position collapses} 26. Kb1 Rca8 27. Rd3 {Giving White a chance to grab either rook but the king is what I'm after here so best to force mate after Nxb3} Nxb3 28. Qe7 Ra2a1# {}
