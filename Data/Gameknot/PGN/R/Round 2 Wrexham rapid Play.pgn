1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 {And so we transpose into a Benoni} d6 5. e4 exd5 {My opponent was graded BCF 170, one of the highest in the tournament. He was also young (early 20s) and keen, so maybe instead of playing sharply I should have taken with the e pawn here} 6. cxd5 g6 7. f4 Bg7 8. Bb5+ {This is all opening theory. Now blocking with the f knight is the most popular option.} Nbd7 9. e5 dxe5 10. fxe5 {White continues agressively} Nh5 11. e6 Qh4+ {It is here that I forgot the analysis! I should continue with 12. g3 Nxg3 13. hxg3 Qxh1 and 14. exd7+ Bxd7 15. Bxd7+ Kxd7 16. Be3 and for rook and 2 pawns, white has 2 knights. It is probably better to delay capturing on d7 and play Be3 first. I have played this position with white and won, in a Gameknot game,  14. Be3 Qg2 15. exd7+ Bxd7 16. Bxd7+ Kxd7 17. Qg4+ Kd8 18. Nce2 Re8 19. Qf4 Be5 20. Qxf7 Bxg3+ 21. Kd2 Re7 22. Qf3 Qxf3 23. Nxf3 Rd7 24. Nxg3 Rxd5+ 25. Ke2 Kc7 26. Ne4 b6 27. Nf6 Rf5 28. Nxh7 Rh8 29. Nhg5  me vs frebec,  Started: 07-Nov-09, Ended: 30-Jan-10} 12. Kf1 fxe6 {Now black can castle with check and then save the knight on d7. I later found out that there are three games with this position on the database of Gameknot games. All of them are black wins!} 13. Nf3 O-O {By castling, black pins the white knight on f3, so I can't take his queen!} 14. dxe6 Ne5 {This position was reached in the three Gameknot games. e7 was tried in oldtimer (1704) vs. marshy1 (1814), Bg5 in stikmat (1765) vs. altera (1883) and Kg1 in kumli (1968) vs. lethe (1790). All of them ended in black wins. I tried something else. } 15. Qd5 {With my own threats.} Rxf3+ {A nice exchange sac!} 16. gxf3 Qh3+ 17. Kf2 Bxe6 {For the exchange black has all his pieces active. } 18. Qxb7 Rf8 19. f4 {So I decide to give up the f pawn in order to exchange my undeveloped bishop on c1 for one of his attacking knights.} Ng4+ 20. Ke2 Nxf4+ 21. Bxf4 Rxf4 22. Qb8+ {Forking his rook on f4, forcing it to retreat} Rf8 23. Qg3 {Hoping for a queen exchange of course!} Qh5 {but no chance! black is now threatening Nf2 winning back the exchange. I decide to move my king out of the line of fire.} 24. Kd2 Bh6+ {Now Kc2 gives him a nasty knight check on d3. I don't want to move back onto the d1-h5 diagonal. Kd3 looks suicidal after Rd8, so that leaves one square.} 25. Ke1 Bf4 26. Qd3 Qh4+ {Now Kf1 allows mate on f2, Kd1 loses the queen to Nf2, so there is only one other move} 27. Ke2 Qf2+ 28. Kd1 Ne3+ {Unless I want to try giving up my queen the next move is forced too.} 29. Kc1 Nc4+ {Now 30. Kd1 Nxb2#, so I tried the other king move.} 30. Kb1 Qxb2# {Oops! Well played black. Don't forget to rate this game and leave some comments!}
