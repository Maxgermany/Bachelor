1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {This was played against me in my second game against reversion, so I decided to try it out since he recommended that I try different openings.} Nf6 {So, Terence develops, whilst, threatens my pawn.} 3. Nc3 {So, I defend by developing.} Nc6 {Likewise, he continues with his development.} 4. Nf3 {As do I, and I also prepare to castle.  After this Terence will knab my pawn and I'll take back.  Knowing that taking is not a mistake here, I felt pretty good about the position.  But, after studying those blitz Q sacs from tactical-abyss, I'm not going to get too comfortable.  That's because anything can change, so one cannot let their guard down.} Nxe4 5. Nxe4 d5 {That's because the piece is not won with this move.  In fact, I saw this fork and asked myself what to do.  In the end, I decided to give him my N, as I'd get a pawn since his N was pinned.  If I gave him my B, there's no pin, so I'd wind up behind, as opposed to, level.} 6. Bb5 {?? But, there was a better move that would've put me ahead, and I did not see it.  So, Terence implied that this is the losing blunder by saying, "Jkarp have you ever seen this line by black before. The correct move is 6. Bd3 regaining the piece."  And, I said, that is a problem as I have not.  The reason for not playing was that I didn't want to block my center pawn but had no idea that I could get a piece from that.} dxe4 7. Nxe5 Qg5 {Threatening my N.  So, I decide to exchange in order to avoid losing my N.  I was hesitant but realize that there's no alternative.  And, I have to take with the B.  Now, I had considered 8.Nxc6, with the idea of 8...bxc6, 9.Bxc6+ to win that Rook.  But, after thinking about what Jack Stockel emphasized 10 days ago combined with it being a weakness, I realized that it was a mistake.  Therefore, I asked myself what Jack said of why Terence would do that.  Turns out that he would not because if I played 8.Nxc6, 8...Qxg2 immediately follows.  And, if I try a discover check, then ...Bd7! would immediately win a piece.  Either my Bb5 or Ne5 which I didn't want to allow.  So, I decided that an immediate check was best.  I'm still going down a pawn, but it's better then losing a piece.} 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. Nxc6 Qxg2 10. Rf1 {But, at least, my Rook is defended.  However, this is no time to party, as we're about to see.} Bg4 {I started doing it here since Terence did not take the pawn.  But, I'm in a lot of trouble.  Trying to see multiple variations, after what Ken taught me, I still missed too many for my own game, so now was not the time to celebrate as I'm about to see.} 11. f3 {The reason, however, for me celebrating was that I remembered what Ken told me about certain move.  So, I thought yes, the danger is over, and I'm now safe.  That's because this appears to protect my B.  But, what I overlooked though is what happens after he takes with my pawn.  I knew he would, but missed the entire story that the board was trying to indicate, just like I did with bhidragon.  As it turns out, when all is said and done, Terence is going to have unstoppable passed pawn, which is what I missed in all of the variations.} Bxf3 {As now, I have no choice but to give my R for B.  Had I known the full extent of where I was, I would've resigned right here.  But, not knowing that I take because after he took back, I thought that, aside from being an equivalent to a piece down, I'm allright.  But, that isn't so here.} 12. Rxf3 exf3 {And, that's because of this passed pawn.  At the very least, Terence is going to be a Queen up, on top of, what he's already won.  Knowing that, this where I figured out that there was nothing else to learn, and thus, resigned here.  What it comes to show is that, it only takes one bad move to mess up the entire game as it did here.}
