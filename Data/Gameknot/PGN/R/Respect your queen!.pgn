1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 {From my limited experience i know that taking out your queen at the beginning of the game, is not something you want to do. now the queen is open for attacks, and during the time you protect your queen the opponent develops his/her game - taking out more pieces and making a good strategic stand. I have a phrase: " Respect your queen, and leave her alone, until such time she is needed in the game" } 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 5. c3 {When you are threatened, try to find a way to improve your stand in the game. } Bxd4 6. cxd4 {The center is almost mine...} Ne7 7. e5 {If the queen is out - Attack!} Qe6 8. Nc3 c6 9.
