1. d4 {This is a random game I picked to annotate: the title "Randomly Picked..." describes how I came to annotate it, not the moves that were played :-). Anyway, White opens with queen pawn, my favourite...} d5 2. c4 {The overwhelmingly preferred move in this position: the Queen's Gambit. White intends to draw Black's central pawn onto the wing and grab a lion's share of the centre.} dxc4 {Black accepts. "A good idea if you like counterattacking, but if White plays accurately he will keep the advantage for a long time" (GM Yasser Seirawan).} 3. e4 {My preferred move: immediately seizing the centre. 3.Nf3 is quieter and more flexible. 3.e4 also puts immediate pressure on Black's c4-pawn.} e6 {Much stronger is 3...e5, immediately counterattacking in the centre. Winning the e-pawn 4.dxe5 is a weak move as after 4...Qxd1+ 5.Kxd1 Nc6 Black has the advantage. 3...e6 is more passive, and also allows to develop a bishop and recapture the pawn.} 4. Bxc4 {So, Black recaptures the pawn, and doesn't need to waste a move to do it.} c5 {Black's plan in many QGA positions: to counterattack and restore equilibrium with ...c5. Although this is generally played when White goes for the quieter 3.e3.} 5. d5 {White pushes a well-defended pawn into Black's territory. I usually play this as 4.d5 after 3.e4 e5, to attempt to hold my central gains.} exd5 6. Bxd5 {White's bishop has a dominant central position, and is slightly ahead on development.} Qd7 {A weak move...I think... - I can see no reason for Black to spend a tempo on a small queen move, and block his bishop. This allows White to claim a greater lead in development.} 7. Nc3 {Holds onto White's central gains, and claims a clear lead in development.} Nf6 {Seems natural: keeping pressure on White's dominant central position, and developing a piece. Perhaps he should have played 6...Nf6.} 8. Nf3 Nxd5 {Removing the annoyingly powerful bishop.} 9. Nxd5 {9.exd5 and White has an extremely weak d-pawn: isolated AND extended. This move keeps White's pawns together and puts a powerful knight in the centre - an outpost, as no Black pawns can attack it. Am I overrating the power of a minor piece in the open centre?} Bd6 {Develops a piece.} 10. O-O O-O 11. e5 {A provocative and risky move: weakening the knight outpost, but gaining space in Black's side of the board and gaining a tempo, forcing Black's bishop to move. The downside is that this pawn is far from the defence of its other pawns, and can be shifted with a timely ...f6.} Bc7 12. Qb3 b6 13. Rd1 {Preparing a potentially dangerous discovered attack which threatens to win queen for rook and knight - a gain of 1 material point.} Bb7 14. Nf6+ gxf6 15. Rxd7 Nxd7 {The exchanges are performed, and I see now that White's gains are not limited to a single point of material. Granted, Black's bishops are very powerful on their diagonals, but Black's kingside is cracked open, and since White retains his queen he will hold an advantage if he goes for a kingside attack. Black's minor pieces are also far from the kingside's defence. However, of course, if Black mobilises his defensive pieces quickly he will stand a good change of weathering the onslaught.} 16. Bh6 {! A strong move, gaining a tempo (unless Black wishes to lose even more material, in which case White can exchange off pieces and enter a won endgame) and forcing Black's king to stay exactly where he is: the f7-square cannot in the near future be used as an escape square, due to Black's doubled pawns. Black's king becomes a sitting target.} Rfe8 {Escaping the material loss, and perhaps paving the way to a successful defence by placing his rook in front of his kingside.} 17. exf6 Re6 18. Ng5 {Enter another attacking piece.} Rxf6 19. Qh3 Rd6 20. Nxh7 Rd8 {20...Kxh7? 21.Bf8+ Kg6 22.Qh6+ and Black's king is stuck in the open. Instead, seemingly ignoring White's threats to his king, Black is following a checkmating threat of his own.} 21. Bf4 Ne5 {Discovering a checkmate threat 22...Rd1+ 23.Rxd1 Rxd1#. White must react} 22. Re1 {Preventing Black's rook from giving check, while adding more pressure on the knight.} Rd6d1 {A powerful pin. White is forced to go for the draw he has in hand on the kingside:} 23. Nf6+ Kf8 24. Bh6+ Ke7 25. Ng8+ Ke8 26. Nf6+ {Draw agreed, on grounds that perpetual check was not far off.}
