1. Nf3 {Just a normal opening.} b6 {Odd, but playable.} 2. e4 {A good way to keep him from doing what he wanted to.(Ba6)} e5 {Still nothing drastic.} 3. Nxe5 {It might be threatened next turn, but still worth it.} d6 {See what I meant?} 4. Nf3 {I could also play Nd3 if I chose.} Nc6 {Black chooses to develop his QK.} 5. Bb5 {It'll be protected soon, but it develops my bishop and forces him to waste a move.} Bb7 {A good move, although Bd7 would have been better.} 6. O-O {I had to fit this in somewhere.} Qf6 {It's ok.} 7. Nc3 {I probably should have played e5.} a6 {Aahh!} 8. Bd3 {So annoying.} b5 {Eccentric, but not bad.} 9. Nd5 {He will move his queen, of course.} Qh6 {Said so.} 10. Nxc7+ {Now he's forced to move his king instead of protecting his rook.} Kd8 {This forces me to make that move right away, but its ok.} 11. Nxa8 {He'll take my knight, but its still good for me.} Bxa8 {I don't mind.} 12. c4 {It's an unusual gambit, but it could end well.} Nb4 {He choose to threaten my bishop.} 13. Ne1 {That knight was being kinda lazy anyway.} Nf6 {Odd.} 14. Qf3 {I decided to protect my pawn. I probably should have played cxb5.} Nh5 15. a3 {I for some reason chose to do this.} Nxd3 {He takes my bishop, I take his knight.} 16. Nxd3 bxc4 {He finally takes my pawn. That sucks.} 17. Nb4 {I move my knight away.} f5 {Another endlessy annoying gambit.} 18. Nxa6 {I should have just let that be and played Qxf5.} fxe4 {He takes my pawn, and now, I shall do something stupid.} 19. Qxe4 {See?} Bxe4 {This is when I realize that what I did was really stupid.} 20. d4 {I had to do something.} Qg6 {He gets ready to mate me....} 21. a4 {....But all I do is obliviously move a pawn.} Qxg2# {And that is mate.}
