1. d4 e6 {i new experience for me : e6...c6...d5!? i give a strong and secure centre occupation} 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 d5 4. e3 {normaly, my oponents take d5....but this is not a "normal" oponent !} Nf6 {so let's develop and then we see what happens } 5. Be2 Bd6 6. O-O a6 {preparing b5} 7. b3 {preparing response...} b5 8. Ba3 {maybe i could do something else than take this offered bishop, something like Qc2 ?} Bxa3 9. Nxa3 {but this knight there in the corner looks useless and it will stay there for a long witch is not so good for white } O-O 10. Ne5 {this is a terrible grap, it will stay there quite until the end of the game, making me loosing, } Ne4 {preparing f6} 11. Qc2 f6 12. Nd3 {so the bloody knight is out. But my mistake is what follows, because i gave him the opportunity to replace the knight there. It s a very dangerous grap because of f7 threat} e5 {that was not very good } 13. f3 Ng5 14. dxe5 dxc4 15. bxc4 fxe5 16. Nxe5 {here we are, from now, i will never be able to put out this e5 knight, what would you do for it ?} Bf5 17. Bd3 Bxd3 18. Qxd3 b4 19. Qxd8 Rxd8 20. Rad1 Re8 {and now i thought it was a good move, because there is 2 threats on 2 opponent knights. i had a dream... a dream that i would win this game !} 21. f4 {but not !} Ne4 22. Nc2 c5 {would it been better Nc3 first ?} 23. Rd3 Nc3 {it seems to late...} 24. a3 a5 {i wont give him my knight so easily !} 25. Ra1 Ra6 {neither my rook ! } 26. Kf1 h6 27. h4 {he is advancing his pawn in order to put it on h5 and then to put his knight in g6, preparing a kind of mate with a rook in h8 for example, i can feel it ....} Kh7 28. h5 {you see ?!} Ne4 {so i have absolutely to take this pawn, and i will get it see what follows ...} 29. axb4 Ng3+ 30. Kf2 Nxh5 {YES ! but it will cost me a pawn in queen side } 31. b5 Rae6 {and a very bad situation with a dangerous past pawn in b colon} 32. Rxa5 {...and one more pawn lost...the end of the game is coming} Rf8 {this was a very nice tentative ! so i could take the knight with my e6 rook because the protection (pawn f4) is pined} 33. Kg1 {but of course, i'm challenging a good one, isnt it ?} Ng3 {so from now to the end, it's a slow death ....} 34. Ne1 Nf5 35. g4 Nd6 36. Ne1f3 Nb7 {could i have a chance to fork his rooks ?} 37. Ra7 Nd8 {for the moment I'm being closed} 38. Kg2 Rfe8 39. g5 {i did saw the fork coming...so i fall into the trap} hxg5 40. Nxg5+ Kh6 41. Nxe6 Nxe6 {i'm -4 now, } 42. Rd6 Kh7 43. Rb7 Nf8 {searching a way to break this jail} 44. Kf3 Kg8 45. Rc7 Nh7 46. Rxc5 {one more pawn ...} Nf6 47. Rc7 Rf8 {so here is a good move, I'm going to fork him, unfortunately, it wont be enough, I'm to late in the game} 48. c5 Ne8 {YES ! but it's nice anyway even if it is not enough !} 49. Rc8 Nxd6 50. Rxf8+ Kxf8 51. cxd6 {i will never be able to win against those advanced pawns, } Ke8 52. Kg4 Nd7 53. Nxd7 Kxd7 54. Kf5 Kxd6 {one} 55. Kg6 Kc5 56. Kxg7 Kxb5 {two} 57. f5 {so it's a nice end, he is just 2 pawns more than me, that's not so bad isnt it ?} Kc6 {last chance} 58. f6 Kd7 59. f7 {too late any way} Kd6 {i resign}
