1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 c5 {The good, aggressive move I recommend.} 4. c3 Nc6 {99% of players go like this, when the tought move for me to meet would be cxd4, and I don't know how to unbalance the game in my favour. } 5. e3 Qb6 {I can choose Qc2, but I wouldn't recommend  b3. I had serous bad experience with it. } 6. Qb3 {99% players don't exchange queens. He did.} Qxb3 7. axb3 {Ok, new scenario. How to attack without a Q??} cxd4 8. exd4 {Not interested in exchanging pieces so soon, I'm not going for a draw. My pawns are solid, and they will keep so. } Be7 9. b4 {You'd queston it, but look at Nc6: he has no place to go after b5, and a6 doesn't work beacuse of the pin on the a8 R. So no developing move right now, but any alternative was just a shot in the dark (Bd3 is ok, but what for? h3, so to get a square for the B after Nd5? How boring! Let's be nasty! :-)} b6 {b5 is now uneffective because of Na5, defended. No point in playing it, unless I have concrete plans on the dark center square, which is not the case. My goal is to place a N on c4, so to threat Nxb6 until the R is still undefended...} 10. Nbd2 O-O {? Black is allowing me a wonderful outpost!} 11. Nc4 {I am now in control of d6, and threatenin Nxg6.} Nd5 {Nice. No Nxg6 anymore, and this is hard to attack... safely (c4 opens the way to Nb4 and Nc2+). And this makes a tempo for me to save the B (I sure want it!) before b4, followed by NxN and Rxa5, winning a pawn. } 12. Bg3 f5 {Still threatening and gainin space. I can save my B into h5, so I will take the tempo. } 13. b5 {If f4, Bh4. } Nd8 {True is the N now has where to go. No advantage for me, Nd5 still in place. Good defence, no question. } 14. Bd6 {I hope some N play can help me. I'm aiming at d7 and Nc6.} Bxd6 15. Nxd6 Nf7 {Again, I played too ightly. This blocks me all the way. I should have gone back Nc4, for sure, but I felt I was going nowhere, so...} 16. Nxc8 Rfxc8 17. g3 {I'll play along the diagonal. } Nd6 {...but he has Ne4. } 18. Ne5 {The weack side of his good move...} Rc7 {The natural defence leaves Ra8 undefended, but I am in no position to exploit it. } 19. Bg2 {Unfortunately, I can't play c4. Rc1 would be wise. } Ne4 {I seriously though about BxN, here, and try to win the black pawn. } 20. O-O {Instsad, I went for a disappointed and suboptimal move like my opponent did before. } Rf8 {Planning an attack on f4, but I have BxN.} 21. Rae1 {with the idea BxN, winning the pawn, but fatally overlooking...} Nd2 {Ouch! Nothing, nothing to do!} 22. Re2 Nxf1 23. Kxf1 Ne7 {Black prepares d6.} 24. f4 {Sooner or later I will play it, so why not now? Sigh... a balanced game like this almost decent... and I blundered like a novice! } Ng6 {No d6 (he saw Rxe6 after it). No point in exchanging the N, I have to shield in. } 25. Nf3 {No evil in closing the diagonal for the B: it is useless right now.} Re8 {Preparing a strike, so I can't move my N. I'm getting tangled. } 26. Kf2 {For my B to come to f1 if needed. } Kf7 {Interesting! I'll grab the chance, just to show him I'm not dead. } 27. Ng5+ {The threat on h7 is a fake. If I play it, Rh8 and then Rxh2. } Kg8 {But he overlooked it. Good for me, for now. Now comes h6.} 28. Nh3 {I'll let the B diag open, but this is a very poor move. I'ts up to black to show me how to break in.} h6 29. Bf3 {Inmediately grabbing my chance to threat something: Bh5. } Kf7 {? The chanche I was waiting for!} 30. Bh5 {DOUBLE pin! But I still can't break in!} Kf6 {Well... I can stil play Re5 (but what for?). Instead...} 31. Kf3 Re7 {Unpinning, it's ok. } 32. g4 {The strike I was plannin. } fxg4+ 33. Kxg4 d6 34. Nf2 {I expected here to force d5, closing the game in my favour. } e5 {Well, now BxN works, but it was very boring. } 35. Ne4+ {Let's dance a little} Kf7 36. Nxd6+ Kf6 {Here, I missed the winning f5!, and if black retires the N, Ne4#! Beautiful, and I missed it. i also missed BxN, and after Rxe5 the two joined passed pawns should win easily. } 37. fxe5+ {Threatening Rf2+} Nxe5+ {!? } 38. dxe5+ Rxe5 {...and my opponent fell in his own trap. He surely didn't see my next move...} 39. Ne8+ {Slam! Black loses an exchange, and all hopes. Thank you for reading!}
