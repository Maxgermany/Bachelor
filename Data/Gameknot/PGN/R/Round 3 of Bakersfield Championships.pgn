1. e4 {I am White. I played this game in a live tournament where I won a first place trophy with a 5-0 score. } c5 {Mostly all of the players in Bakersfield tournaments including me play 1...c5} 2. Bc4 {I usually play c3 instead of Bc4, but I'm the scourge of Bakersfield tournaments and was afraid the players were getting accustomed to my normal openings.} Nc6 {One of several good moves. Other good moves are 2...g6, 2...d6, 2...e6, and 2...Nf6.  I play 2...Nf6 because I like the sharp unbalanced battles that arise after 2...Nf6 e5 d5 exf6 dxc4 fxg7 Bxg7, because I am leading in development, but my doubled c-pawns could become a weakness. } 3. Nc3 {I need to control d5 as much as possible, because in this opening, it is common for Black to play e6 Ne7 d5, gaining space in the centre and making my bishop move again.} d6 {This move adds to Black's control of the central dark squares, and g6 Bg7 does the same. I recommend g6 Bg7 in this position because it aids in castling along with control of the dark squares. The move d6 should only be played if extra control of e5 is needed, or if Black needs to develop his queen's bishop.} 4. f4 {This is the Grand Prix Attack. I rarely play this opening as White, but will if I am playing a low rated player or someone who knows my normal c3 opening. I never studied it, so most of my experience came from when I play against this opening as Black.} e5 {This move may appear strong to amateurs, because Black is clearly dominating the dark squares, but he has given me a spot on d5 where I can keep a piece in his territory, and he cannot chase it away with a pawn.} 5. d3 {5. fxe5? is a bad move, even though it gives up an f-pawn for a more important d-pawn, it gives Black an open d-file, and I need my f-pawn because a common move in this opening is to play f5, gaining space on the kingside, and maybe following up with g4 h4 then g5. So f5 was a good move in this position, but I played d3 because I wanted Black to take on f4, giving me a more mobil and better developed position. But f5 was better, because Black has usually played g6, stopping f5.} Nf6 {Black should've played g6, which stops f5, but instead allows the f5 move again.} 6. Nf3 {A positional blunder. Much better is f5 followed by g4 and h4, with a strong kingside attack. But I wasn't very experienced playing this opening as White. Here Black should've played Bg4, because after trading on f3, Black has control of d4, giving me complications.} Nd4 {Black wants to defend against my threat of Ng5 by moving a piece to e6 obstructing the bishop's path, but Bg4 is a much easier way of doing this, and after he trades, he should have about equality.} 7. Ng5 {I'm not winning yet, but I'm starting to gain a kingside initiative.} Be6 {Ne6 gives Black an uncomfortable cramped position after Nxf7 Kxf7 f5, because I win the piece back while exposing Black's king.} 8. Nxe6 fxe6 {Nxe6 gives me an f5 tempo, plus good control of the light squares because Black's light bishop is gone.} 9. fxe5 {Black stopped the possible f5 plan, so now I want to weaken Black's centre pawns to attack.} dxe5 {Black's e-pawns are weak because neither can be protected by pawns.} 10. O-O {Not completely neccesary. I wanted to control the f-file with my rook, but it does hardly anything for my plan to weaken Black's doubled pawns.} a6 {Black wants to gain space on the queenside with b5, disrupting my c-file units.} 11. a4 {I don't need any further complications interfering with my plans, so this simple move stops Black's intended queenside expansion.} Be7 {Black needs to castle because I may disturb his king during my quest to win the doubled e-pawns.} 12. Ne2 {I strike the defender of the weak e6-pawn, but I am not threatening to win it because Nxd4 Qxd4 is check.} Qd6 {Black wants to defend his weak doubled pawns, but he should've taken this opportunity to castle, since I'm not threatening to win anything.} 13. c3 Nxe2+ 14. Qxe2 Rd8 {If Black wanted his rook on the open d-file, then he should've at least castled queenside. Black is wasting valuable time and should be making multi-purpose moves like O-O-O.} 15. Bg5 {I wanted to trade my passive bishop for Black's good knight which takes away some of my queen's squares. Always trade your inactive pieces for your opponent's good defensive pieces.} Qb6 {I wasn't sure why this move was made, because it doesn't really do anything to help the position, except puts his queen on my king's path.} 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 17. Qg4 {This is why I wanted Black's knight gone.} Ke7 {Black has waved his right to castle, and will soon be punished for leaving his king in the centre.} 18. Kh1 {I couldn't find a better move here. I thought about Rxf6 gxf6 Qg7  Kd6 Qxf6 Re8 Rf5, but the position was too complicated and I already liked mine. I wanted my king off the queen's diagonal in case I ended up moving my bishop, I didn't want any annoying c4  cxd3 threats.} Rd6 {18...Rd6?? A losing blunder, immidiately giving me the game.} 19. Rxf6 {A temporary sacrifice. Never miss tactics like this that will give you an easy win.} Kxf6 {If gxf6, then Qg7  winning the rook, but taking either way is still losing.} 20. Rf1+ {Black's king must leave the defense of the g7-pawn.} Ke7 21. Qxg7+ {This was the move I calculated when I first sacrificed.} Kd8 22. Qxh8+ Kc7 23. Qxh7+ {This is how much damage can be done if you don't castle. Here I have an extra bishop, and two extra pawns on the kingside with an easy promotion path. Normally I don't like to annotate games where my opponent blunders and gives me a totally winning position, but I like this game because it shows how I saved myself from almost losing.} Kb8 24. Qg8+ {Qh8  simply wins another pawn. I was too excited about my winning position to make accurate moves, and I had less than 5 minutes on my clock, while my opponent had about 7 or 8.} Ka7 25. Qg3 {I should've been advancing my pawns instead of threatening an unimportant one. Most of my moves here were split-second decisions with about 3 minutes left. My opponent was moving quickly too, hoping to run me out of time.} Qxb2 26. Qxe5 Qe2 {Here I was annoyed because of Black's annoying threats. And I was already nervous because I was low on time. If I move my rook, then it becomes inactive, and Black has other annoying ideas like Rb6-b2. The move I made here doesn't allow any of those complications, and instead gives me a simple win, which would've otherwise been a long complicated battle, with less than 2 minutes on my clock.} 27. d4 {I was afraid of losing on time in a complicated position, so this move simplifies the game and gives me a game that isn't hard to win with less than 2 minutes.} Qxc4 {It is okay to give up material when you already have a material advantage. If it is essential in simplifying the game and giving you an easier more comfortable win.} 28. Qxc5+ {Now I force a queen trade.} Qxc5 29. dxc5 {Leading to a simple rook-pawn ending, where I have three extra pawns and can win easily despite having less than 2 minutes left. } Rc6 {The next ten moves were made in less than 10 seconds.} 30. g4 {My pawn cannot be stopped, because it can always be supported by its brother on the h-file.} Rxc5 31. Rg1 {In rook endings, rooks usually belong above the passed pawn instead of below it, but it doesn't matter in this position because I have two passed pawns.} Rxc3 {My two passed pawns are all I need to win, so I couldn't care less about the others.} 32. g5 Rc7 {A last desperate attempt to stop my pawn.} 33. g6 Rg7 34. h4 {This blockading technique only works against isolated passed pawns.} b5 35. axb5 {I could still win easily if I ignore the pawn, but since I was in time trouble I just wanted to be safe.} axb5 36. h5 {Black should resign now. The rest of his moves were made in about 1 second, in an attempt to run me out of time, but that won't happen now because I have simplified the game.} b4 37. h6 Rg8 38. g7 {38. h7?! doesn't win as fast.} b3 39. h7 {Here, I stopped recording my moves because my win is clear, and I had less than 1 minute left so I was only focused on mating him before I lost on time.  }
