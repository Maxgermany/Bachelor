1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 g6 4. Nc3 e6 {I know it is playable, but I don't like to trap my own bishop. } 5. Bf4 Nf6 {I am not a fan of "rules", but black has started developing the first piece just now, against 3 well placed pieces by white...} 6. e3 Bg7 7. Bd3 {It is well known that dxc4 makes only an apparent waste of tempo for white.} O-O 8. Ne5 Nbd7 9. c5 {This "squeezes" black's position a lot. But white hasn't got anything concretely, yet. } b6 {A big mistake, but black has almost no moves to play. Though, he must have taken the knight and played Nh5 in order to release the position. } 10. Nxc6 Qe8 11. Bd6 {And a quality is gone for black. } bxc5 12. dxc5 {Correctly. Another choice was Ne7+, Kh8, NxB, black retakes, BxR. This way white cashes.} Bb7 {Not possible now, but white has more aces in his sleeve. } 13. Bb5 a6 14. Ba4 Bxc6 {Realizing that Ne7+ is a winning threat.} 15. Bxc6 Qc8 {This just loses another quality. A better try for black could have been Ne4, posing threats on the black diagonal. } 16. Bxa8 Qxa8 {This proves the previous move was a waste of tempo. But it is also setting a nice tactic...} 17. Bxf8 Bxf8 {White should have castled here, even losing a pawn and freeing black's pieces. } 18. b4 d4 19. exd4 {You would say white "saw" everyting that is about to happen, and decided he could survive the storm. } Qxg2 20. Ke2 Ng4 21. Rf1 {Qf1. Black cannot exchange the queens due to his material.} Nxh2 22. Rh1 {The storm get worse. If black plays Bh6, is threatening mate at once. White must play something like Qd3, but black is near to make white sweat...} Qf3+ 23. Kd2 Qxf2+ 24. Ne2 {White must look to exchange queens here, even if he doesn't like it. } Bh6+ 25. Kc3 Qf3+ 26. Qd3 {Which he finally does. But he could have played the king, if it wanted to avoid the exchange. } Qh5 {The storm is over. } 27. Qg3 {Or Ng3. Now it is forced. } Qxe2 28. Rxh2 Qe3+ 29. Qxe3 Bxe3 30. Kc4 {Rah1 was pointless. } f5 {Black's only chance are the pawns...} 31. b5 {but unfortunately, white has pawns too. Anyway, maybe c6 was better. } axb5+ 32. Kxb5 Bxd4 33. c6 {Of course, if black takes the rook, c7 (an not cxN)} Nb6 34. a4 {If black takes the rook now, KxN but white has a harder time crowning his pawns. } Nc8 35. Rd1 {Best for black is e5, supporting the B with the pawn. White can play RxB, winning, of course, but it would have been harder. This way, black sets the position for another material loss. } Be5 36. Re2 Bg3 {The last mistake. I thought the previous move was played in order to go to c7, preventing the rook to check.} 37. Rd8+ Kf7 38. Rxc8 {What else? Black has no time to move his pawns. } h5 39. a5 h4 40. a6 h3 41. a7 h2 42. Rh8 f4 43. a8=Q {Game over...} Kf6 44. Qd8+ Kf5 45. Qe7 f3 46. Qxe6+ Kg5 47. Qe3+ Bf4 48. Qxf3 {}
