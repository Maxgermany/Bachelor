[Opening "Budapest (A52), Alekhine, Abonyi variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 {The standard reply to d4} 2. c4 {and this is standard too} e5 {The Budapest Defence, a tricky opening, ideal for these conditions.} 3. dxe5 {White normally takes.} Ng4 {The alternative Ne4 is more or less refuted by 4. a3!} 4. e4 {Attempts to hold on to the extra pawn tends to White get into trouble } Nxe5 5. f4 {So instead of material advantage, white has a space advantage.} Nec6 6. Be3 {Otherwise black can play Bc5 and castling is difficult} Bb4+ {Developing with tempo} 7. Nd2 {I didn't want him doubling my c pawns.} O-O 8. Bd3 d6 9. Ngf3 Bg4 10. h3 {I found out later that 0-0 is normally played in this position, but what I played seems OK.} Bxd2+ 11. Bxd2 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 {Both sides continue their development.} Qh4+ {I'm not convinced by this check, as white can chase the queen back with gain of time. I was more worried about him playing Nd4 and then supporting it with c5 and N(b)-c6} 13. g3 Qe7 {so off it runs} 14. Bc3 {and this rules out Nd4} Nd7 {so the other knight has to come here} 15. O-O-O a5 {White has a space advantage and black tries to grab space on the queen side. I'm not convinced that this achieves much} 16. Rhe1 f6 {to try and prevent e5} 17. Qh5 {with threats of e5} g6 {Now I would love to have had more time to look at this position more carefully. Probably Qh6 or Qh4 is correct, but I thought why not switch wings....} 18. Qb5 {I only expected Nb6, but he improved with} Nc5 {mmm I don't want to lose the two bishops I thought} 19. Bc2 Na7 20. Qxa5 Nc6 21. Qb5 {He can now get a draw by repeating the attacks on my queen, however he played} Rxa2 {I now came up with the idea of trying to exchange on c5 and I played} 22. Bd4 {Now of course, if Rh1 check, not Kd1 losing the bishop on d4, but Bb1. However he now takes advantage of my bishop moving off the e1-a5 diagonal} Ra5 {oops I'm losing my queen. Never mind I can get bishop and rook for it.} 23. Bxc5 Rxb5 24. cxb5 Nb8 {I can't help thinking this is not the best square for the knight.} 25. Ba3 Nd7 26. Bb3+ Kg7 {Kh8 was safer as we shall see.} 27. Bd5 b6 28. Bc6 {I'm trying to get e5 in again} Nb8 29. e5 {At last!} Nxc6 30. exd6 {No need to recapture the knight immediately} Qd7 31. dxc7 Qxc7 32. Bd6 Qf7 33. bxc6 Re8 34. Rxe8 Qxe8 35. c7 {The smoke has cleared. White now has rook, bishop and pawn for the queen.} Qc6+ 36. Kb1 Qe4+ {Now I can't go to h1 as Qh4 wins, and I don't want to repeat with Kc1, 37. Qc6 etc, although this was probably the soundest move.} 37. Ka2 {37....Qa4 still wins for him - Ba3, 38. Qc4 picks up the c pawn, or the rook drops with check} Qc4+ {Fortunately he didn't play that!} 38. Ka3 b5 {Threatening Qa4 mate} 39. b3 Qc2 40. Rd4 b4+ {I can take this pawn of course, but why? It is better to leave it as a potential shield from queen checks.} 41. Ka4 Qc6+ 42. Ka5 Qa8+ 43. Kb6 {and he has run out of queen checks.} Kf7 44. Rc4 Qc8 45. g4 {Now my plan is to play f4 to make squares for my bishop to retreat to, and then play R-d4-d8 to win!} Ke8 46. f5 Kd7 47. Bf4 Ke7 48. fxg6 hxg6 49. Re4+ Kf7 50. Rd4 Qe6+ 51. Rd6 Qc8 52. Rd8 Qe6+ 53. Kb7 Qe4+ 54. Kb6 Qe6+ 55. Bd6 Qe3+ 56. Bc5 Qe6+ 57. Ka7 {and black is no longer able to stop the pawn, so he resigned.
