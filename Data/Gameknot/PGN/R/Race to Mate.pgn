1. e4 d6 2. d4 e6 {I had the feeling that I misplayed this opening badly.  I think I should have been more aggressive and I opened a line I should not have.} 3. Nf3 h6 {Ignores the center and development, so I develop.} 4. Bd3 a6 {And this also seems unnecessary  and doesn't develop!} 5. c4 Nd7 6. Nc3 Ne7 7. O-O {In a 3 min + 10 game I'm feeling like I should be able to break this open.} Ng6 {I was about to play e5 but now I thought it wouldn't work and so I developed. Actually it would have worked!  7. e5. dxe5  8. Bxg6, fxg6 9. dxe5 and I think white has an edge.} 8. Qc2 {Black's next move makes this pointless! } e5 9. Be3 {So I keep developing. There should be a way to break this open and I don't want to close the center with d5 so I develop.} Be7 10. Nd5 Bf6 11. Nxf6+ {I just opened a file on my king.  I hope he is going to castle queenside now but I'm not sure he will cause he might be very safe in the center.} gxf6 12. Qd2 h5 {I threaten the h6 pawn so he pushed.} 13. h3 {I thought I would need to do this when he played h4 so I did this in anticipation.  I probably should have waited till he pushed but it does work out ok.} Ndf8 14. dxe5 fxe5 {Straightening out his pawns is not good but I was looking for a place for the DSB but it didn't work out.} 15. Bg5 f6 16. Bh6 Ne6 {His knight is now headed for f5 and there is nothing I can do.} 17. Rad1 Ngf4 18. Bxf4 Nxf4 19. Kh2 {The h3 pawn will need protection and the g1 square will need the rook to help guard g2.} Rg8 20. Nh4 Be6 21. Rfg1 {The attack is looking strong.  I think black missed 20. ..., f5!} Qd7 22. b4 {After Qd7 I should have Qe3 but I was betting he was about to castle.  ( Not a good idea to move on what you expect you opponent to do instead of the best move ( Bxh3 ).} O-O-O 23. b5 {23. Bxh3 is still best.} axb5 24. cxb5 Bxh3 {now he plays it but now white has threats.} 25. Qa5 Qe6 {Black gives himself an escape square.} 26. Qa8+ Kd7 27. Qxb7 Rxg2+ 28. Rxg2 Bxg2 {Black expects to penetrate with the queen and give mate once white runs out of checks but there is a move the puts and end to this idea.} 29. Nf5 {Black needs an escape square!} Qg8 30. Qc6+ Ke6 31. Bc4+ {Black resigns as it is mate next move. }
