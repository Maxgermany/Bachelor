[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 {And I'm playing Tom again.  He's had alot of really solid OTB results recently -- much better than mine, in fact.  I'm not feeling confident enough to experiment with d4 vs him today.  I play *my* game.  e4!} c5 {Excellent.  We don't get alot of Sicilians, the two of us.  I'm eager to play these because I'm experimenting alot with NM Dana MacKensie's "Nuke The Sicilian" variation of the Grand Prix attack.  (1 e4 c5, 2 f4 d5, 3 Nf3 dxe, 4 Ng5 Nf6, 5 Bc4 Bg4, 6 Qxg4!? Nxg4, 7 Bxf7 Kd7, 8 Be6 K to somewhere and Bxg4).  I don't attempt the Kopec system, which he's previously seen out of me because I'm pretty sure that since we've already had an OTB game or two in that system, he'll have sufficient familiarity to bust me.} 2. f4 d5 {The move advocated by none other that the mighty Tal.} 3. Nf3 {Per NM Dana Mackensie.} dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 {And I might get to play the Nuke line.  Come on... Bg4.} e6 {Then again, i might not.} 6. Nc3 {So it's just time to play chess.} e3 7. O-O {Making the gambitted pawn a true gambit.} exd2 8. Qxd2 Be7 9. Qe2 {I didn't want to block the dark-square bishop any more, but where the heck is it going to go?  I wasn't thinking about Nc6 followed by Nd4, which is a bit of a pain.} Nc6 {I'm groaning here.} 10. Rd1 Bd7 {I felt this was the wrong way to block.  I was expecting Nd4.} 11. Bxe6 {Too speculative, certainly.  Not the sort of thing that should be done already a pawn down.  But when I smell blood, I tend to bite big.} fxe6 12. Nxe6 Qc8 {Obviously best.} 13. Nxg7+ Kf7 {Tom is playing perfectly.  I'm still -1 materially, but I've managed to prevent castling.} 14. Nh5 {And I instantly saw the counterplay.  It was too late long ago, I'm afraid.} Bg4 {Ack.} 15. Qc4+ {And I'm expecting Be6 and I'll play Qe2, hoping he'll accept a draw.  Feeling sheepish.} Kg6 {And this invites an interesting gamble.} 16. f5+ {If Bx, I get Nf4 and Ncd5 -- linking up to make "happy knights", always nice, that.  Unfortunately it's only temporary.  I'm pretty sure the threat on the d1 rook can't be collected upon.} Kxh5 {Taking the knight, however, gives me chances, due to the confluence of the c1 bishop's force and that of my queen...} 17. Qf7+ {... which moves to f7.} Kh4 { } 18. Qg7 {And this was played without considering h6, which prevents Qg4 and Bg5.  From this position, Qg4#, so something must be done.  if Rg8 Kh5 Qh6, snuffing black early.  g3 was best.  Love that hindsight.} Qxf5 {Which I did not anticipate, but that pawn wasn't doing much of anything.  Already, I'm looking at getting the queen to e1 or f2 after something like Qh6 Nh5 Qd2.  Either that or something that involves that plus g3 and Qg2.  My thinking is a little fuzzy, but there must be something in there.  I hope to god there's something in there.} 19. Qh6+ Nh5 20. Rd5 {And I jumped on that like it was the best idea ever played by man.  I missed the point.  If Bd2, Be1 is unstoppable and the king is still disadvantageously ensconced.  Someone will have to die on the black side so that the king may live.  I saw it shortly afterward.  Sigh.} Ne5 {I wish I'd spent some more time on that last move.  I didn't consider that I was giving black a chance to bring in more guys.} 21. Qd2 {And I play my original idea.} Nf3+ {Saccing back a little material to make my king vulnerable too.} 22. gxf3 Qxf3 {Eek.  Thankfully, I have the initiative.} 23. Rd3 {And the queen can't afford to retreat!  After the white queen checks on e1 or f2 (whichever is available, white's dark-square bishop continues to hold the king in the box.  Which game is it that an annotator, losing the power to quantify the position, simply said "The board is on fire"?  This perhaps isn't quite that high quality, but Tom and I both know we're playing a heckuva game.} Rhg8 24. Qe1+ {The obvious move, but I have no idea what my follow up is after Kh3.} Kh3 {To my mind, there wasn't anything besides this.  That certainty left me with most of the day to consider how to play next.} 25. Ne4 {The idea is that the discovery is empty since Bg5, buying time to capture the queen with check.  This is why I'm 1500 USCF and 1750 gameknot.  I can just walk away and let the position work itself out on gameknot.  OTB, I have to sit there and stew in my own adrenaline.} Bh4 {I'd been expecting a rook to f or light-squared bishop to somewhere or other.  This made me panic until I remembered the vague impression that in lines after g3 (which i never played), Qg2 might mate.  g2 isn't an option of course, but f1 is!} 26. Qf1# {A truly bizarre and wonderful game for a couple of patzers.}
