1. d4 {The pawn dash!} d5 2. e3 Nc6 3. c4 Bf5 4. a3 e5 5. Ne2 exd4 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 {i dont usually like trade offs but i wanted to keep my bishop on f5} 7. Qxd4 c5 8. Qe5+ Ne7 9. Nc3 f6 10. Qg3 d4 11. Ne2 {i was expecting exd4 here and to my surprise he went } d3 {the important bishop f5 from earlier, protects and will now buy me the 2 turns to get my knight in for the killer blow} 12. Nc3 Nc6 13. f3 Na5 14. e4 Nb3 {no one likes losing a Rook and this time he did as expected. and i did not need my bishop anymore but i don't think he saw that.} 15. Rb1 d2+ 16. Ke2 dxc1=Q 17. Nd5 {i think he gave up here. Rxc1 also results in Mate i think his only option was f4 to buy him some time or heavy losses, or my knight was just too devastating to him and i think he was expecting me to use it to eat a piece instead of being cover for my attacks.} Qd2# {hope you enjoyed the nice double queen on board finish within 17 moves ><}
