1. Nf3 {As I know very little about the Reti opening, I'll choose my next moves in the  database.} Nf6 2. b3 d5 3. Bb2 Bg4 4. d3 {At this point, I wonder if the b knight has to come on d7 or c6} Nbd7 {I finally opt for 4. ... Nd7 Sir Perceval is going to protect his fellow Lancelot.} 5. Ne5 {The white knight is challenging Perceval.} Nxe5 {No real choice. Perceval must accept all challenges} 6. Bxe5 {Black has no way to fire the bishop immediately.} e6 {So that Dame Guenièvre can protect her faithfull Lancelot. Black has now 4 pieces out against 3 for white. } 7. h3 {The bishop has little places to go.} Bh5 {Carrying on pinning the white Lady.} 8. Nd2 {developping} Bd6 {I want to get rid of the anoying ecclesiastic} 9. Bc3 {I'm not sure it's a very good move : the bishop is unprotected.} e5 {Black's plan is to take full control of the center.} 10. Nf3 d4 {The soldiers advance} 11. Bd2 h6 {So that white's DSB is blocked on both diagonals. } 12. Nh4 e4 {If 13. dxe4 Nxe4 and the white knight is under menace of Dame Guenièvre. If she can come to f6, there is a mating menace by a further Qxf2} 13. Nf5 {White sees the trap and sends his brave knight in the middle of the ennemies... Paradoxically, the safest place.} O-O {Preventing 14. Nxg7} 14. Nxd4 {So that the knight kills the poor d4 soldier...} Be5 {... and is pinned to the rook} 15. c3 {d4 has lost his protection} exd3 {If 16. exd3 Bxd1} 16. g4 {Enabling exd3} Bg6 {Only place} 17. exd3 {White is ahead again in material but has a weak king.} Re8 {Preparing Bxd4} 18. Be3 {It doesn't prevent Bxd4 but provides an escape to the king.} Bxd4 {Trading} 19. cxd4 {No real  choice} Qxd4 {Dame Guenièvre charges in the middle of the battle} 20. Be2 {Preparing to castle} Qc3+ {White has only one move available if he wants to castle} 21. Kf1 {If 21. Bd2 Qxd3} Rad8 {Aiming at the queen. Material equality, the white king is unsafe, Black controls the open and semi open files, and indirectly the center (all his pieces are aiming at it). Black's pawn structure is better (white has an isolated pawn) and black pieces are better connected. Black's plan is to fully destroy white's e and d pieces to cut white army in two.} 22. Rc1 {Of course.} Qe5 {Protecting c7 and preparing an attack on the DSB.} 23. Rc5 {I overlooked this move.} Nd5 {But it doesn't change black's plan} 24. Qc1 {Ptotecting the c rook and the DSB} Nxe3+ {Lancelot charges furiously under the eyes of his true love...} 25. fxe3 {... and dies heroïcally} Qf6+ {Dame Guenièvre is sad but doesn't attack foolhardy.} 26. Kg2 {To join queen and rook.} Bxd3 {Black's plan has not change : eliminate the central white pieces.} 27. Rf1 {Menacing the black queen...} Qe6 {Aiming at the e pawn.} 28. Bxd3 {At least, this move doens't surprise me (many previous moves by white were unforeseen).} Rxd3 {White can take the c pawn but black has now mating menaces.} 29. Rxc7 {I'm not sure it's a good move, black will have a very strong attack. 29. Rc2 might have been better.} Qd5+ {At this point, I hoped it was the final attack.} 30. Kg1 Rexe3 {"Mission completed, my King"} 31. Rc8+ {Countering, but white cannot get further} Kh7 {I do not think white can avoid the mate, except by trading his queen against a rook.} 32. Qc2 {Pinning the rook but black doesn't need to move it - Mate in 5 } Reg3+ {White submits here. I add the mate.} 33. Kh2 Rgxh3+ 34. Kg1 Rh1+ 35. Kf2 Rh2+ 36. Ke1 Qe4+ 37. Qe2 Qxe2# {}
