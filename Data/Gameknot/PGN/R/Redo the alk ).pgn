[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B04), modern, fianchetto variation"]

1. e4 {This Alekhine defense game against easy19 was to replace an earlier one where stalhandske got an undeserved win on a time-out. Easy19:s strength is of course much higher than his current rating, so it was exciting to play this game. I am hoping that Freddy will also comment on it later.} Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 g6 5. c4 Nb6 {A very common line of the Alekhine defense with aggressive capture of the centre by white, the very typical d6 and fianchetto of the DSB by black.} 6. Nc3 {This is the first move out of the GK "book". exd is often recommended here, but I think Nc3 is a more logical developing move} Bg7 { } 7. Be3 {Black finishes the fianchetto and white develops further. 7. Bf4 might be an interesting variant} dxe5 8. dxe5 {Black takes e5 as it is time to clarify (simplify) the centre and white takes back with the pawn. I think taking with the knight (8. Nxe5) had been an interesting and more aggressive alternative, where white would have kept the strain in the centre and prevented the exchange of queens } Qxd1+ {Almost forced. Otherwise white had initiated the Q exchange and black's castling had been ruined} 9. Rxd1 c6 {Black cannot castle because 9...0-0, 10. c5! N6d7 11. Nd5 with a strong attack by white} 10. h3 Be6 {10....0-0 was the alternative, but I favoured the solid development of the LSB} 11. b3 Nb8d7 12. Bf4 {White's DSB finds the f4 square after all (see above) supporting the e5 pawn that is under double attack. The question here is whether it was worth supporting it versus developing the LSB to e2} Nc5 {An alternative was 12.....0-0-0 that may have led to interesting consequences} 13. Nd4 Nbd7 {resuming the dual attack at e5, but now white advances on the Q-side....} 14. b4 Na6 15. Nxe6 {I was wondering why white did not advance 15. b5} fxe6 16. a3 Bxe5 17. Bxe5 Nxe5 {Time to finally take the lone white e pawn & following exchanges. At this point I think the game is fairly even. Black's double pawn is not necessarily a significant minus.} 18. h4 {I think white advances here anticipate the short castling by black. 18. Be2 had perhaps been a more straightforward move?} O-O 19. Rh3 Nc7 20. h5 {And, indeed, white attacks on the king side whilst black brings in the ineffective knight from the sideline} Rad8 21. Rxd8 Rxd8 {The exchange ends by black controlling the d-column, but white's attack is now on....} 22. hxg6 hxg6 23. Ne4 Kg7 {black's obvious idea is to take hold of the h-column with his rook, considering that white's king will remain in  the centre} 24. Nc5 b6 25. Re3 Kf6 {White exerts pressure on black's position; black counters by taking his king into play} 26. Ne4+ Kf5 27. Be2 {white finally takes his LSB into play} Rh8 {...and black counters according to plan....} 28. g4+ {I wonder whether this is good, I don't think it is worth sacrificing the pawn here.} Nxg4 29. Ng3+ Kg5 30. f4+ {That was the idea! But black must not take the f4 pawn (30...Kxf4 31.Re4+ Kxg3 32. Rxg4+)} Kh4 {Here, black has a +2 in material and quite a decent position} 31. Rf3 Nf6 {I actually don't remember what I was planning here. 31. ...Nh2 had been clearly better! Even 31....Nh6 with regard to the following movements of the knight!} 32. Nh1 Nh5 33. Rf2 {Now black is suddenly in grave danger. His king is fully exposed and there is a real danger of checkmate. I used considerable time here to analyse the position, and it is remarkable! Apart from 33. ....Nxf4, which loses the knight (and the game), any other move than 33...Kh3 leads to mate at 34. Rh2++} Kh3 {The only move!!} 34. Rf3+ Kg4 35. Nf2+ Kf5 {Of course not 35....Kh4 because 36. Rh3++} 36. Bd3+ Kf6 37. Ng4+ Kg7 {White continues the king-chase but now the black king is in relative safety, but with sweat on his forehead} 38. Ne5 b5 39. Nxc6 bxc4 40. Bxc4 a6 41. a4 {An inevitable decimation of black pawns} Nf6 {The knight must be brought in for the following "horse-show"} 42. Nxe7 {another inevitable (I think)  loss of a pawn and now material is equal} Kf7 {In retrospect, I think 42...Rb8 had been better. I am perhaps too eager to chase away the white knight} 43. Nc6 Nfd5 {Putting pressure on the white pawns at b4 and f4, and also hoping for a free pawn on the d file if white exchanges his bishop for the knight} 44. Kd2 {the white king wants to play} Rh4 {more pressure on white's f pawn and indirectly on his bishop and b pawn} 45. b5 axb5 46. axb5 {white now has a free pawn on the b column, which fortunately turns out to be managable by the black pair of knights} Rh2+ 47. Kd3 Rh4 48. Bxd5 {the question is whether white instead should have advanced his king further (Kd4)} Nxd5 49. Ne5+ Kf6 50. Nc4 {.....and the coast seems clear for advancing the b pawn. Beautiful choreography by white's knight!} Ke7 {Why not coolly exchange 50...Rxf4 51. Rxf4 Nxf4 instead? The answer is that I was afraid of the advancing b pawn....} 51. b6 Kd7 52. Ne5+ {Looks bad for black, doesn't it? } Kd6 53. b7 Kc7 {black's "only move"} 54. Ke4 {Now I can take f4} Rxf4+ 55. Rxf4 Nxf4 56. Kxf4 {There we are! White cannot defend his "only hope", the pawn at b7, and the black king cannot do everything! So, a clear draw. The last few moves were formalities only, the two kings were to meet in the middle for a cup of tea and a chat..... I thank Freddy for a memorable fight, and I am very pleased to have been able to keep it as a draw} Kxb7 57. Kg5 Kc7 58. Kxg6 Kd6 59. Nc4+ Kd5 60. Kf6 Kd4 61. Kxe6 {}
