1. d4 Nf6 {The match continues, Remohgramps vs me. I'm black this time. My opponent opens with 1. d4 so I reply Indian style.} 2. Bf4 g6 {The Trompowski Opening would suggest 2. Bg5. By comparison, 2. Bf4 seems a bit mild, and not part of any line I have found against the Indian system.} 3. Be5 Bg7 {Interesting. I wonder if he'll trade. 2. Be4 violates one of the minor opening principles that suggests not moving bishops until after moving their adjacent knights. 3. Be5 violates another opening principle that it's generally unwise to move a piece a second time until you've developed the rest of your pieces.} 4. Nf3 d6 5. Bxf6 Bxf6 {Yep, he traded.} 6. Nc3 Bf5 7. e4 Bg4 {Maybe 6. ... Bf5 was a little weak, inviting white to play 7. e4 and gain a tempo. But g4 didn't seem to be any better, expecting a quick push of the white pawn to h3. Nor does e6 look better with white able to push his pawn to d5. I guess d7 was OK, but I kind of want a knight there to help support a black pawn on c5. Maybe black should have gone that route first.} 8. Be2 Nd7 {Planning 8. ... c5.} 9. e5 dxe5 {I looked at this move and thought that with 9. dxe5 black could win at least the e5 pawn outright (maybe with something like e9. dxe5 10. dxe5 Bxf3 11. Bxf3? Bxe5). Or if white is careless, black could win a piece (I am looking now and can't find it, but I'm pretty sure in my head during the game I thought I had at least one way to come out a piece up with bad play by white). Truth is, all black managed to accomplish here is an even exchange of some material. Had I worked this out better in advance, I would not have chosen a long sequence of exchanges that liquidates half the material on the board and leaves white with a superior position, threatening to give away a draw to a player rated 600+ points lower than me (I much prefer to keep things complicated when playing with such a favorable disparity in the ratings, invite my opponent to make mistakes), so I think I'll give 9. ... dxe5? a question mark.} 10. dxe5 Nxe5 11. Qxd8+ Rxd8 {More exchanges.} 12. Nxe5 Bxe2 {Now black is ahead by a pawn. If 13. Kxe2? or 13. Nxe2?, then black replies with 13. ... Bxe4 and remains a pawn ahead. White does have a sneaky move here though. By about the 10th move I had revised my evaluation of the exchanges, but it was too late, the snowball was rolling down the hill. I saw 13. Nxf7 coming, but I was hoping my opponent wouldn't see it.} 13. Nxf7 Kxf7 {The two black rooks are forked. Black must capture on f7 or lose the exchange. But he doesn't have to capture on f7 immediately. During the game, a few moves back, it occurred to me that a zwischenzug here with 13. ... Bxc3+ would wreck white's queenside pawn structure, isolating all three pawns and doubling two of them on the c-file. I had planned to play it. Then, when it got to black's 13th move, I totally forgot that plan and played too quickly to prevent the fork, losing that chance.} 14. Nxe2 b6 {Now it's ugly. Material is even, but white has two sets of three adjacent pawns, while black has an isolated pawn on the half-open e-file. Black wants to play 14. ... Bxb2, but white would reply with 15. Rxb1 and 16. Rxb7, recovering the pawn and getting a powerful rook on the 7th rank. So 14. ... g6 is intended to prevent that, knowing full well that white won't allow such an obvious pawn capture.} 15. c3 Rd6 {Whit eprotected his b2 pawn and black prepares to double rooks on the only open file. } 16. O-O Rd2 {16. ... 0-0? was a blunder. With even material and a superior pawn structure, white was heading for a winnable endgame, or at least an easy draw (not bad for being a 600+ point underdog). But the white king was protecting d2 and by castling, he gives that square up to black's rook. Black is now forking the knight on e2 and the pawn on b2. One of them must go.} 17. Nf4 Rxb2 {Ah, that's better. This now looks like a winnable endgame for black.} 18. Nd5 c6 19. Nxf6 exf6 {White makes two mistakes with one move. 19. Nxf6? trades pieces when white is behind in material. Also, it allows black to un-isolate his e-pawn with 19. ... exf6. Of course, any other move by the white knight allows 19. ... Bxc3, although 19. Nb4 (threatening to recapture after 19. ... Bxc3 with 20. Nxc6) seems to hold onto everything. 19. ... c5 chases the knight back to d5 where it defends c3 and can be supported by 20. c4 then 21. Ne3 if black attacks the knight on d5, and 19. ... a5? just allows white to immediately capture on c6. 19. ... Rc8 gives white time for 20. Rfc1.} 20. g3 Re8 21. Rfe1 Rxe1+ {21. Rfe1? offers black a 6-for-5 trade, exchanging rooks and gaining the pawn on a2 in the bargain.} 22. Rxe1 Rxa2 23. h4 Rc2 {Might as well hunt the last white pawn on the queenside - it might interfere with the black promotion steamroller.} 24. Rd1 Ke6 {OK, now I got nervous. Black dares not allow white to get his rook on the 7th rank, forking the king (who was on f7) and the pawn on a7. But white will either get there, or get a three-move repetition draw (the white rook can keep threatening to move to d7 or e7 and any moves by the black king to prevent it would be met with checks until eventually black repeats the position three times or abandons the 7th rank). Now that black is ahead in material and faced with a certain win, I am of no mind to allow the repetition draw, so I may have to let that rook rampage on the 7th.} 25. Re1+ Kf7 26. f4 Rxc3 {White doesn't seem to see it so black gobbles the last queenside pawn. This makes me much more comfortable with white getting to the 7th rank now.} 27. Kf2 Rc5 {White still didn't force his way to the 7th rank, so now black shuts that down entirely.} 28. Rd1 Rd5 {And now white goes for it, and black denies it. No white rook on the 7th today, not now anyway.} 29. Rxd5 cxd5 {Not that white had any further winning/drawing chances without serious blunders by black, but trading his last piece with 29. Rxd5? is definitely the final nail in white's coffin.} 30. Ke3 Ke6 31. Kd4 a5 {Black wants to get his king to e5, but not at the cost of losing the e-pawn after 31. ... Kf5. I considered doing it anyway, then demolishing white's kingside pawns and promoting on the kingside while white was busy preventing queenside promotion, but that felt a little too much like running up the score. Much more fun to pretend the six kingside pawns don't exist.} 32. Kc3 a4 {Baiting the white king further.} 33. Kb4 b5 {White cannot play Kxb5 now or any time hence because he will then lose the foot race with the a-pawn as it successfully sprints for promotion on a1.} 34. Ka3 d4 {Bait. At this point I entered a few sets of conditional moves, all based off of advancing the d-pawn, getting white to chase that pawn, then advancing the a-pawn, etc. Any captures by white guarantees the promotion of the other pawn, so eventually he'll capture one and black will promote the other.} 35. Kb4 d3 {Following the plan (actually, this was part of the conditional moves that white played while I wasn't looking).} 36. Kxb5 Kd5 {However, 36. Kxb5 was not one of my conditional moves. I figured white to stop one queen, rather than allow both. Not that black needs two queens. Black takes the opposition, chasing white to the edge so that after the d-pawn promotes, there will be less chasing to do.} 37. Kxa4 d2 38. g4 d1=Q+ {Check.} 39. Kb5 Qb1+ 40. Ka6 Kc6 41. g5 Qb6# {Final position.}
