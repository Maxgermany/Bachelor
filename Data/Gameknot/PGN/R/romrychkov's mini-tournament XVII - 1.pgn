1. e3 {Revenge Mark 1  There is a special joy for those return matches where I've been absolutely thumped in the first match and manage to squeak summat in the second. Jap managed to quite comphrensively overwhelm me in the first game to the point where he was saccing his rooks for fun at the end....} e5 2. c3 d5 3. b4 Bd6 4. g4 Nf6 {Interesting development tactics....} 5. f3 h6 6. Na3 Bd7 7. Bd3 c5 8. bxc5 Bxc5 9. Bf5 Bxf5 10. gxf5 Nc6 {Feeling good so far, with ten moves gone my development, which is usually lousy, seems far better.} 11. Qa4 O-O 12. d4 exd4 13. cxd4 Bd6 14. Bd2 Qe7 {Being hopeful of the a3 knight here, rather obvious, but I can't do subtle very well....} 15. Nb5 a6 {Worried about the a7 spot and not wanting to give him any holes to exploit. This time.} 16. Nxd6 Qxd6 17. Nh3 b5 {No real plan here other than to push him back and try to constrain his movement.} 18. Qb3 Rfe8 {That was a planned move and turned out to be critical. A one space rook move!} 19. Nf4 {That was I think a mistake by him. It ignored what I was about to do so he evidently hadn't seen it. Then again nor did I.......} Nxd4 {That had been my original planned move, so intent on that one was I that I didn't even think of QxK instead. But it still works well as queen under threat but has to find some way of keeping me out of c2 and to a lesser extent f3.} 20. Bb4 {O...k..... that wasn't supposed to happen. Its MY turn to attack, not his.... Luckily that move that I overlooked before is still there....} Qxf4 {*chortles happily* This is the point at which I can imagine my opponent swearing profusely. I'd certainly be in his position. Two pieces under threat and he can't take either. Still got to worry about that c2 spot for the knight, but now those e and f pawns looking decidedly iffy.} 21. Qb2 {Overwhelmed with choices here, knight to f3, queen to f3, queen to e3.... I chose the rook in the end simply to continue a three piece attack rather than try and cope with the two, over-reach and get thumped.} Rxe3+ 22. Kf1 Qxf3+ {I don't think going the other way would have made much difference at this point. But now he is stuffed. Its a forced move to g1 with the continuation K-e2, QxK RxQ, then whatever move he makes he can't prevent Q-g2 mate. So being far more gentlemanly than I he acknowledges and resigns.}
