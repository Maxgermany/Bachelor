1. Nf3 {Trying to gain control of the middle board} e5 {Truthfully, this was a big mistake on my part. He could have easily taken my pawn.} 2. Nc3 {He didn't, for some reason. Maybe he's trying to be nice?} d6 {In any case, I move my pawn to gain some semblance of control.} 3. d4 {Trying to force my hand} exd4 {I take his pawn...} 4. Nxd4 {...and he evens the game.} Nc6 {I want to see if I can force him to relinquish control of the middle board. Right now, he basically controls the fifth row.} 5. e4 {He ignores my move. Grr!} Bd7 {Protecting my knight...} 6. Nxc6 {If he had made this move earlier, he might have forced me to use my pawn on b7 to retaliate... but now I take it with the bishop.} Bxc6 {Like so.} 7. Bb5 {Yet again, he tries to force my move.} Bxb5 {Why not take his piece? Not much else to do around here.} 8. Nxb5 {He responds.} Nf6 {Trying to get my knight out of there...} 9. Bg5 {...but he pins it again, and I must change my strategy.} Qd7 {Get my queen out of there while at the same time threaten the knight. Perhaps he won't notice.} 10. Qd3 {He does, and now his queen protects the knight. But that's okay.} Be7 {Because he was distracted for a turn, I can now protect my knight.} 11. Bxf6 {He takes my knight...} Bxf6 {...and I respond in kind.} 12. Rd1 {At this point, I have no idea what he's doing. Maybe he wants to try some sort of strategy with his queen?} Bxb2 {At any rate, he has left his pawn open, so I take it.} 13. Qh3 {This was not the best move to make. While it does directly threaten my queen, it is also the move that gives me control over the rest of the game. Notice how his queen does not move after this, and I go from responding to his moves to making offensive plays.} Qxb5 {I start by taking his unprotected knight. } 14. Rd5 {Trying to threaten my queen, eh? Well, I won't let you!} Qb4+ {Now he has to respond to my moves, instead. } 15. Kf1 {Not the greatest move in the world. Perhaps Rd2 would have been better. } Qxe4 {He leaves another of his pawns unprotected, so I take it. After I made this move, he resigned.  A good way for white to make a comeback of sorts from here on out is to reactivate the queen. If this were me, I'd move the queen back to d3. This both protects the rook and forces black out. Then either you exchange queens (black does Qxd3, and rook takes the black queen) or else black moves the queen somewhere else and white regains control. }
