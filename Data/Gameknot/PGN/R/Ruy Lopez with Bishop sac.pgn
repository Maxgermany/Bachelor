1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez} d6 4. d4 {I decide to push open the center since he advanced his queen pawn.} exd4 5. Nxd4 Bd7 6. Nc3 {I could have exchanged here, and maybe I should, but I thought this move was fine.} a6 7. Nxc6 {Now I decided to exhange and mess up his queen side.  This does slow down his kingside development, which helps me win.} Bxc6 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. Qf3 Be7 {Now he realizes he needs to get those king side pieces moving.} 10. O-O Qd7 {But he doesn't play Nf6, like I think he should have.  Now I was thinking, is he about to castle queen side?} 11. Bf4 Nf6 {Now he develops his knight, but my strategy is in place, and his queen is my target.} 12. e5 dxe5 {He takes, and now I have an open file for my rooks.} 13. Rad1 {I'm first there, always important.} Qe6 {He had a couple options, and I think this was not the best.} 14. Bxe5 {I offer up my bishop as an easy sacrifice, and lo and behold...} Qxe5 {he takes it!} 15. Qxc6+ {Now he is in serious trouble, about to lose a major piece and mate is almost inevitable.} Kf8 16. Qxa8+ Ne8 {only move really.} 17. Rfe1 {let's attack the queen some more} Qf6 {not a good place in my opinion} 18. Nd5 {now mate is really inevitable} Qf5 19. Rxe7 Qxc2 20. Qxe8# {tada!}
