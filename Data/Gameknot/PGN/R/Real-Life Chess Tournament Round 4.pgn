1. d4 {The setting: a real-life chess tournament, quite near where I live. Round 3. Rapidplay: 30 mins for all moves per player.} d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. cxd5 Qxd5 {This is an unusual line of the Queen's Gambit Declined: Marshal Defence: Exchange Variation. Obviously now 4.e4 is unplayable.} 4. Nc3 Qd8 5. Nf3 {I can get ahead on development while Black fiddles around with his Queen .} h6 6. e4 Bg4 7. e5 Nh7 {Pushing back Black's few developed pieces.} 8. h3 Bh5 9. Qa4+ c6 10. g4 Bg6 11. d5 {I am trying to cover as much space as possible in my advance.} b5 12. Qb3 a6 13. Be3 Qc8 14. O-O-O e6 15. dxe6 {Would 15.d6 have been better? I thought about it at the time, but I didn't want to run the risk of over-stretching my pawns, and I like the nice open d-file for my rook.} fxe6 16. Nd4 Bf7 17. f4 {I believe White has the better position, controlling much more space than Black. Even so, at this point I offered a draw, which he declined.} Bc5 18. Bd3 Nf8 19. f5 Bxd4 20. Bxd4 c5 {A loss of material is forced after, say, 21. Be3 c4, forking White's queen and bishop.} 21. Bxb5+ {It loses material, fine, but it loses the least material.} axb5 22. Qxb5+ Nbd7 23. fxe6 Bxe6 24. Be3 Rb8 25. Qa5 {I am trying to avoid exchanges and create complications at every turn, being behind on material.} Ng6 26. Rhe1 {Rhf1 to prevent Black from castling was an option, but it loses the e-pawn. Notice the trap: 26...Ngxe5 27.Bf4 and Black loses a knight.} O-O 27. Rd2 {I wanted a mobile rook on the 2nd rank to defend against e.g. ...Rf2.} Ra8 28. Qb5 Qb8 29. Qc6 {This looks on the surface like a good complicating move which might even win me material.} Qb6 {Forcing a queen exchange, which I had been avoiding.} 30. Qxb6 Nxb6 31. Rd6 {Aha! A fork presents itself to me.} Nxe5 {But Black can defend against it with the following: 32...Nd3 .} 32. Rxe6 {On reflection...why on earth didn't I play 32.Red1 ? (The ? denotes a question NOT a bad move!)} Nd3+ 33. Kd2 Nxe1 34. Kxe1 {Again here I offered a draw, which he declined.} Nc4 35. Bxc5 Rfc8 36. Bd4 Nxb2 37. Kd2 Nc4+ 38. Kd3 {I just need to play carefully and avoid any blunders.} Kf7 39. Re4 Nd6 40. Rf4+ Kg6 41. h4 Rcf8 42. Rxf8 Rxf8 {Material is exchanged off - my attitude towards exchanges at this time was pretty tolerant.} 43. a4 Rf4 44. Be5 Rf3+ 45. Kd4 {A draw was agreed. This time he offered it, and I accepted. Should I have done so? Anyone? At any rate, this is an interesting game to look at...I think!}
