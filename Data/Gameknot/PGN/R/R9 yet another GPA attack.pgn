[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed, Korchnoi variation"]

1. e4 c5 {Yet another Sicilian! I had 5 White games in this tournament and four of my opponent chose the Sicilian (my opponent in round 7 chose the French).} 2. Nc3 {Heading for the Grand Prix, as in my other games.} e6 {See round 1 for 2...a6, round 3 for 2...d6 and round 6 for 2...Nc6.} 3. f4 d6 {My opponent is developing in a Scheveningen-like manner, quite a solid choice but not especially powerful against the Grand Prix. In my view ...e6/...d5 is the best counter against this opening.} 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bb5 {The usual GPA play, White will exchange bishop for knight because knights favour bishops in closed positions such as this one.} Bd7 6. O-O a6 7. Bxc6 Bxc6 8. d3 {In GPA style, although 8.d4 may have been an alternative. IfBlack exchanges (which is what he probably should do) White gets a knight on d4 and Black has to retreat the bishop if he doesn't want to lose the bishop pair.} g6 {The ...e6/...g6 is also a good setup against the GPA.} 9. Qe1 Bg7 {Oddly enough, I had the exact same position against blitzkov on GK a few days back. I won't go into further detail because the game is still in progress, but in the post-game analysis of this game with my computer, it indicated 10.f5 as the best move which is what I also played against blitzkov.} 10. Kh1 {But here, I chose a waiting move to see what Black was going to do. I was actually hoping he would commit his king to the kingside so I would have an attacking target. This move may also come in handy if Black is going to place his queen on the a7-g1 diagonal or to avoid a bishop check on d4.} Ne7 {Possibly preparing to castle kingside?} 11. Qh4 {!? Well, let's attack then. On hindsight, I suspect the queen was misplaced here and should have been on f2. I still find it hard to master the finesses of this opening, to know exactly which placement of the pieces is best in which positions. Another example is the question whether to start an attack with e5 or f5, although I'm finding f5 is usually the better choice.} Kd7 {Like in round 6, my opponent tries to castle queenside by hand and/or connect his rooks by moving his king to d7.} 12. f5 {?! I try to open some lines now that his king is in the centre, but this is probably just an incorrect pawn sacrifice.} gxf5 {Accepted, and rightly so. Of course the g-pawn was the better choice. Black doesn't have to be afraid of a shattered kingside pawn structure, since his king is not castled there.} 13. Bh6 {Trying to get a bishop exchange as Black's dark-squared bishop looks to be of more use than mine and because it would weaken his defences. Probably 13.Bg5 was better because my move seems to lose a tempo compared to the game. That was also a move that I had considered.} Qf8 14. Bg5 {Now that his queen could retake on g7, I didn't like the bishop exchange very much anymore because Black could put the open g-file to use in a kingside attack.} f6 {I'm not sure if I like this move, but I should have considered it at least (which I didn't do in the game). It does chase my bishop away and it is what the computer suggests, but it confines his dark-squared bishop very much.} 15. Bd2 Qf7 16. Rae1 Qg6 {A strange queen manoeuvre. Maybe he's trying to attack on the kingside, but it just seems too slow and ...Bf8 and ...Rg8 will never follow. It allows me to re-organise my pieces and get some counterplay for the pawn.} 17. Qf2 {! The f-pawns become the new target in Black's position. I was starting to feel better about my position here.} fxe4 {Otherwise Black cannot keep his extra pawn.} 18. Nxe4 {?! Probably the wrong recapture. Although it keeps the e-file semi-open and does not isolate the e-pawn, Black can now get nice counterplay with 18...f5 19.Ng3 h5, similar to what happened in round 6.} Rae8 {Instead he makes a natural development move, but this allows my knights to show their strength.} 19. Nh4 {!? Wins back my pawn. The computer suggests the very interesting 19.b4!? cxb4 20.Bxb4 Nc8, when his knight has to stay passive to defend d6. Strangely enough, I had also seen that it was possible but didn't pay too much attention to it because it was not in the spirit of the normal GPA attack which I'm used to. It's good that I at least thought about it, but I should also learn to really think 'out of the box' and consider those unusual moves.} Qf7 {?! This is probably an inaccuracy. Black can't hold his extra pawn anyway, so he should have played 19...Qg4 20.h3 (20.Nxf6?? Bxf6 21.Qxf6 Ref8 and the knight on h4 is lost) 20...Qh5 and then 21.Nxf6+ Bxf6 22.Qxf6, or 19...Qh5 immediately. Now White will take advantage of the pin.} 20. Ng5 {! The Black player said that he had missed this move.} Qg8 21. Nxe6 Ng6 {Time was starting to play a role as well: 38 minutes for me, 22 minutes for Black _plus increments), with still 19 moves to the time control.} 22. Nxg6 {I thought for a long time here, but couldn't work out the variations completely, so I decided on the safer move. However, it's not the best. 22.Nxg7 is better, when after 22...Rxe1 23.Bxe1 Nxh4 24.Qxh4 Qxg7 I have a good position in the late middlegame thanks to my active pieces and Black's pawn weaknesses. However, I couldn't figure out what would happen after 22.Nxg7 Nxh4 with a triple threat on g2, but then 23.Rxe8 Qxg7 24.Re4! is strong. I guess this is such a position in which it would be easy to work out the best move in correspondence chess, but for which you don't have enough time over the board.} hxg6 23. Nxg7 Qxg7 24. Rxe8 {24.Qxf6?! Qxf6 25.Rxf6 Rxe1+ 26.Bxe1 is most likely a draw due to the opposite-coloured bishops, so I keep the queens on the board to have some attacking chances.} Rxe8 25. Bc3 Qg8 {Stepping out of the pin and accepting that his f6-pawn will be lost no matter what he does. But I think there were better places for his queen to go.} 26. Qxf6 {? This, however, is a serious mistake. Far better was to take it with the bishop (26.Bxf6).} Qd5 {? But Black panics and does not take his chance in time trouble (9 minutes + 30 seconds per move increment for 15 moves). With 26...Re2! 27.Rf2 Rxf2 28.Qxf2 Qxa2 he wins back his pawn and may even have a better position. Now White wins a second pawn and deals with the simple mating threat at the same time.} 27. Qg7+ {Just trying a little trick to make him think.} Re7 {But of course he does not fall for 27...Kd8?? 28.Ba5+ b6 29.Bxb6+ Kc8 30.Qc7#.} 28. Qxg6 Qe6 {Offering a queen trade...} 29. Qxe6+ {... Which I accepted. With two pawns more, I should be able to win this ending (even with opposite-coloured bishops), at least as long as I keep the rooks on the board. I think I didn't have a choice anyway, keeping the queens on would have given Black too much counterplay.} Rxe6 30. Rf2 {And after I defended the seventh rank, Black surprisingly chose to resign rather than keep on struggling to hold this ending. I guess he was just tired of the tournament and had had enough, and moreover he was still short of time. But it would still have been quite a hard job to get one of my two connected passed pawns to the other side. With my last two wins, I managed to end the tournament on +1 (+3 -2 =4) and a 1514 performance, and I was very happy with that. However, I think there's still a lot to learn and I hope I have made the first step with these 9 annotations. I'm also happy that I've finished the job, because it took me a lot of time, but on the other hand I think it was well worth it. Thank you all for reading through my annotations, any tips or suggestions would be welcome.}
