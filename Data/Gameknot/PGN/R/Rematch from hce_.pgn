1. c4 {i am not sure the name of this opening but i think its kinda slow.} e5 {ill take the center then.} 2. e4 {i think he is trying to transpose into a nice game.} Nf6 {i do not mind} 3. Nc3 {i would have moved d6 maybe but theh again thats 3 pawns in a row.} c6 {stopping the knight from advancing} 4. d3 {there we go} Bb4 5. Bd2 {the usaul answer} Na6 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Be2 d6 8. O-O {same side castleing, if i were white i would have tried to castle queen case if his attack fails my defense can over power him.} Be6 9. Ng5 Bc5 {i hoped he would take the bad bishop so i could open my rook} 10. Nxe6 fxe6 {thank you for obliging} 11. Bg5 {no biggie she will move} Qb6 12. b3 Nd7 {opening the rooks road to victory} 13. Bh4 Rf4 {nice guarding but the rook has many ideas} 14. Na4 {pushing the queen out} Qb4 15. g3 {messing up his castled position.} Rf7 {leaving space to double up} 16. Bg4 Nc7 {i do not want to lose the e6 pawn.} 17. Bh5 g6 {i do not want to lose my rook either} 18. Bg4 Raf8 {finally.} 19. Qe2 Bd4 {i probably should have just took the pawn now but i wanted to be sure about it} 20. Rac1 Nf6 {hoping to push a bishop off the board} 21. Bxf6 Rf7xf6 {now i better take that pawn soon} 22. Bh3 Rf6xf2 {i win the exchange here.} 23. Rxf2 Rxf2 {leaving the discovered check as an idea that leaves me with atleast a rook to the exchange or a knight and 2 pawns.  he resigned after this move.}
