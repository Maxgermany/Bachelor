1. c4 e6 2. d4 d5 {Transposing from an English game to a QGD game. Normally I accept gambits, but I kinda had no choice but to play on from here.} 3. Nc3 {White chooses to let Black capture the c4 square. In exchange, he develops a piece and weakens the d5 square. Plus if I choose to take, my pawn is isolated. } dxc4 {In blitz I usually prefer to take an aggressive approach. So why not start it early? } 4. e3 Nf6 5. Bxc4 {White recaptures the pawn and develops another piece. } Bb4 {An aggressive play. In a real game c5 or Nc6 would be considered here. I pin the knight and open the line to castle.} 6. Nge2 O-O {My queen side is under developed at this point, but at least I can safely move to c6 without worrying about a pin.} 7. O-O b6 {!? - Planning to enter a flank war for white's kingside. No knight on f3 strengthens this play. a6 may have been better, but note that this is not an easy move to outright defend.} 8. a3 {Delays my plan for one turn. But forces me to think quick on my feet. To trade or no trade?} Be7 {I decide it is best not to trade. } 9. Qc2 {White flanks my kingside with his queen. This file will become more important as the game proceeds.} Bb7 {May the war of the flanks commence! In hindsight, c5 is also a playable option here.} 10. Bd2 Nbd7 {At this point, I say I am holding my own. So far so good. Not to mention I am also holding a 1 minute lead.} 11. Rfe1 {This move I did not understand. Perhaps someone with a broader understanding can help me out?} c5 {Remember what I said about the c-file! Patience is a virtue. I asked later why white did not advance b4 to which he responded: "Why did you not push c5 earlier? It's all about preparation." } 12. Rad1 {Whatever he is preparing, I can not see. But I'm not the GM.} cxd4 {This was a bit premature and foolish on my end. Qc7 is clearly the better play. My aggressiveness gets to me here. } 13. Nxd4 Qc7 {This move does not have the same potency as before, but I did still want to connect my rooks as well. Also taking aim at white's king, who has nothing on that side.} 14. Bd3 h6 {Decided not to give up a pawn should I decide to move the knight. } 15. Ndb5 {Retreating is a viable option here...} Qe5 {But I decide to press on with my queen and keep my rooks connected.} 16. f4 Qc5 17. b4 Qc6 {In hindsight, I should have just swallowed my pride and moved the queen back to the 8th rank after 16. f4.} 18. Re2 {Stops a rather nasty and embarrassing mate. Finally a defender to the white king arises. Time at this point: White: ~2 min; Black: ~3:30} a6 19. Nd4 Qc7 20. Rc1 Rac8 21. Ne4 {Here, in my head I saw one set of moves, but did another. I originally saw this sequence: Qxc2 22.Nxf6+ Nxf6 23.Rxc2 Rxc2 24.Bxc2 Rc8. Now let's see what I actually did...} Nxe4 22. Qxc7 {Ouch that stings!} Rxc7 23. Rxc7 Nxd2 24. Rxd2 Bd5 25. Rxd7 Bf6 26. Rd6 Rc8 27. h3 Rc1+ {Can you believe we've gone the entire game without a single check yet? It does not matter now though, the game is almost done, though white has all but 30 seconds left. So I now was playing to survive and steal.} 28. Kh2 Ra1 29. Rxb6 Rxa3 30. Rb8+ {And with white having 5 seconds left, I resign here. Mate in one is unavoidable now but was preventable 2X.}
