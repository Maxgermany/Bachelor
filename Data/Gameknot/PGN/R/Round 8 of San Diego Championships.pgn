[Black "Varun (1856)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 {Although statistically and theoretically, e4 and d4 are of equal strength, e4 is the most ambitious first move, since it opens up lines to develop the kingside, while d4 is safer and more solid. I prefer the crazy tactical games that arise from 1.e4, like this one.} c5 {This is the most aggressive move against e4. Although e5 appears to be more accurate, it simply matches me in the centre, and symmetrical positions are good for the player with the tempo.} 2. c3 {I prefer this move, rather than the customary Nf3 followed by d4. When I play d4, I prefer to recapture with a pawn, which strengthens my centre, instead of with a knight, which moves the piece twice in the opening, and gives up a centre pawn for a c-pawn.} Nf6 {This is the sharpest move against 2.c3, since White cannot defend the pawn properly with Nc3. I think 2...d5 is slightly more common since it's easier to play, but most variations of that opening favor White.} 3. e5 {Any other move will reach an incredibly boring game.} Nd5 {Ne4 puts Black's knight out of play for good, and it is likely to get trapped without any escape squares, like with d3.} 4. d4 {The point of c3.} cxd4 5. Nf3 {Developing a piece is slightly more accurate than immediately recapturing, since Black cannot take on c3. I've also been experimenting with 5.f4, which gives my slightly-overextended pawn extra protection.} e6 {5...d3 is a move untalented players play to avoid super-sharp dynamic crazy tactical positions. It's still good for White, but annoying to play against. Most sharp players will play the text move, d6, or Nc6.} 6. cxd4 Nc6 {Most players play d6. I think now Black has given me a slight advantage due to this inaccuracy. } 7. Nc3 {Threatening to weaken Black's pawn structure.} Nxc3 {Wasting a tempo moving the knight again will give me a lead in development, while this move strengthens my centre. Either way, I have a microscopic advantage I must use wisely.} 8. bxc3 Be7 {Better moves for Black are 8...d6 and 8..d5, in which I would play 9.exd6 against either moves, and I'd have hanging pawns in the centre, which would at least give Black a target sometime near the endgame. Although my "weak" pawns would be strong since they are controlling the centre.} 9. Bd3 {The correct square for my light bishop since it aims at Black's kingside and seems snug within my pawns.} O-O {Now that Black has castled, I have a target.} 10. h4 {Some may question this move since I'll be slightly weakened if I castle kingside, but I don't need to castle yet (if at all) and I am preparing for an attack against Black's king, which I carried out brilliantly within the next few moves.} b6 {???????????? A totally losing blunder, even though it seems natural. You'll see why 10...h6 is a much better move for Black, since it would've avoided my brilliant tactics.} 11. Bxh7+ {Now Black is completely lost. If he declines my sacrifice, then he'll be down a pawn with a weak king position, and once he accepted, he got mated quickly.} Kxh7 12. Ng5+ {This attack was so simple, yet so brilliant.} Bxg5 {This move gets mated immediately. Black could've held on longer with Kh6, (or Kg6 h5  Kh6), but I'll win his queen with discovered check, and Black may as well resign anyway.} 13. hxg5+ {Wherever Black goes, I have forced mate due to my incredibly strong queen and rook.} Kg6 {Black probably saw that Kg8 leads to Qh5 threatening mate, and he cannot escape with f5 (intending Kf7), because I can simply play g6 and lock the king in to be mated.  But whenever someone exposes their king on an open board with a lot of pieces, they're likely to get mated anyway.} 14. Qh5+ {I didn't calculate this forced mate possibility when I sacrificed my bishop, I only calculated if Black goes to g8. I simply knew that there had to be a forced mate if Black exposes his king this early in the game, so there wasn't much need for calculation, although I probably should've calculated just to be safe, but whatever, mate is mate, calculated or uncalculated.} Kf5 {Now I have mate in 2. It's only the 14th move and Black is already running for his life. That's what the power of a bishop sacrifice on h7 (or h2) can do.} 15. Qh3+ {I probably have a lot of other forced mates here, but this one I think is the quickest way to mate.} Ke4 {Black's only other move was 15...Kg6, in which 16.Qh7 is mate.} 16. Qf3# {The position of Black's mated king is laughable.}
