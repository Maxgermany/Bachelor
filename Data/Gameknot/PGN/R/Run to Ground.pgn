1. f3 {Hi everyone!  Thinking of trying out the Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening?  Well, do not, I repeat, do not try it out on a player about 400 points north of your rating, particularly the Master Mater.  I ended well and truly on the spit on move 17.  In my opinion .........  THE FRIED FOX/PORK CHOP OPENING SHOULD BE AWARDED THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES!!} e5 2. Kf2 {2. Kf2?? - this move characterises the Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening.  I think it fully deserves two question marks here as you will see.  Always, always play Nc3!  That is the Freddy way!} Bc5+ {2. ....... Bc5+ - development with check.} 3. e3 {3. e3 - blocking the check.  Ke1 is better but I will not be able to castle and this just emphasises what a silly move that Kf2 is.} d5 4. g3 {4. g3 - so far only pawn moves, and 1 king move.  You cannot afford to do this against the Master Mater!  In retrospect maybe c3 was better here or even a developing move like Ne2.} Nc6 5. c3 {5. c3 - one move too late.} Nf6 6. Ne2 {6. Ne2 - development at last.} e4 7. Bg2 {7. Bg2 - trying to catch up in development, but Ne5 is gonna be a right pain where the sun don't shine.} Ne5 8. Rf1 {8. Rf1 - maybe Re1 was better.  At least I would have been able to have avoided moving that rook twice later on and wasted a vital tempo.} exf3 9. Bxf3 Nxf3 10. Kxf3 {10. Kxf3 - Henry is brought right into the open with this series of trades.  With the queens on, it is simply NOT ON!!!} Bh3 11. Qa4+ {11. Qa4+ - getting Glenda out of a possible skewer situation.  Henry is lined up perfectly with the square d1.} c6 12. Re1 Qd7 13. Kf2 {13. Kf2 - Henry makes for g1, I will have at least castled by hand.  Maybe I can think about developing my queenside.  Freddy has other ideas though!} Ne4+ 14. Kg1 Qg4 {14. ..... Qg4+ - here comes the Wicked Witch.  She wants to go to f3 and then g2 delivering mate.  I play my knight to f4 thinking I had covered everything, but ......} 15. Nf4 Nxg3 {15. ...... Nxg3!!! - a Master Stroke - a knight sacrifice.  The knight cannot be taken because the Witch will retake.  I must then put my knight in the way on g2.  The Witch will cooly take it and cackle out ...... checkmate! .....} 16. d4 {16. d4 - this move becomes a token move.  It is now mate in 2.  This move attacks black's dsb and contests control in the centre and frees up some space for my queenside pieces.  Not a lot of use though when I am about to get Freddied yet again.} Ne4+ {16. ..... Ne4+ - which piece would I rather be checkmated by, queen or knight?  Freddy often gets me with his queen which is getting a little bit boring.  Let it be the knight then.} 17. Kh1 Nf2# {17. ...... Nf2# - getting Freddied at all is bad enough, even in the endgame, but getting Freddied in just 17 moves, well, I bet you the jury think I should hide myself away in shame!  Stigmatising oneself does nobody any good.  I come out of the closet here and post things like this as a warning and an example of what and what not to play in the opening!}
