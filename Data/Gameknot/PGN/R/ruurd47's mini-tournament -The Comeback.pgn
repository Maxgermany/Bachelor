[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 {This is a game I played recently against kldr. I actually lost my queen in this game due to playing one night with one too many beers :). At any rate, I resumed playing the next day and was able to make the comeback. If anything this serves as an example never to resign even if you lost a piece in error or in my case too many ale's. } 2. h3 Nf6 {Condensing this annotation somewhat- Normally I would not open black this way with the pawn advancing to D5, typically I start with Pawn to C5, but at any rate after the pawn moves, white moves pawn to H3 which I think was a not a good choice for development. Black responds with NF6} 3. Nf3 Ne4 {White, moves NF3, Black responds with Ne4. I could of developed another piece rather than this response, but if you notice, black knight has a great position here for the time being. There are minimal threats to the black knight pending whites additional moves. If white moves his knight to advance his pawn to F3, Black can move to KG3 and fork the bishop and rook. Alternatively, the other moves will end in a swap} 4. Bf4 Nc6 {White advances Bf4, black develops NC6.} 5. a3 Be6 {Again white advances pawn to a3. Not sure of the value of that move. Black develops Be6. } 6. e3 f6 {White advances pawn to e3, black pawn to f6 ( limiting the advancement of the white knight on f3)} 7. Nbd2 g5 {White NbD2, I was not interested in exchanging so black pawn to g5 to pressure white bishop.   At this point most of black's pieces are on focused on white's Kingside. } 8. Bh2 Qd6 {White retreats to Bh2, and this where my (too many ale's came into play) Black Qd6. } 9. Bxd6 Nxd6 {White bishops captures Queen. Black captures white bishop (Nxd6)} 10. Be2 Bh6 {Next day, white B32. Opening up King Side Castle- why not?. Black plays Bh6. } 11. O-O O-O-O {Both sides castle. I knew that since loosing my Queen I had one shot at winning this game and it was to bombard the King side. } 12. b4 Rdf8 {White pawn to b4 ( I would assume White was making the run to break the pawn line of Black) I continue with the plan and position Rdf8} 13. b5 Nd8 {white advances pawn to b5, threatening black night. Black retreats Nd8 which is likely a better position anyway, providing some additional protection to blacks King if needed.} 14. a4 g4 {white continuing the pawn push. Pawn to a4.  Black can now focus on breaking White's line. Black pawn to G4 ( frees the back bishop, creates a semi open line and pressures White to either double the pawns or move the Knight)} 15. hxg4 Bxg4 {White captures Black pawn, Black retakes with bishop (Bxg4). White Knight does not really have a whole of moves except for the rim of the board or retreat to E1} 16. c4 Rhg8 {White continues pawn push with C4. Here is Blacks opening and where things start to fall into alignment for black. Can you see it starting to happen? Black rook to g8. Black is already down -6 in the game, so I am not interested in exchanging. I want to bishop to go to H3. } 17. cxd5 Nf5 {White captures cxd5. Black Nf5. Building up more pressure on King side. Note White Queen is inactive, as if White Bishop on e3. Great example of " it is not how many pieces you have, but how many that are active"} 18. a5 Bh3 {White continued with pawn push with Pawn to a5. In hingsight a huge error for white as it just allowed me to further develop. Black now can continue with the plan of advancing Bh3} 19. g3 Bxe3 {white advances pawn to g3. Black advances Bxe3. Why did I do that and risk loosing black's most powerful bishop and already being down -6? The reason is white has a decision to make and even though I will loose the bishop, this allows for black to take white pawn on G3 and check the King, or alternatively advance Ne3 to fork the white queen and rook. So a sacrifice but for better options} 20. Re1 Rxg3+ {White sees the potential of the fork, moves rook to e1. Black keeps the pressure on white Rxg3. White cannot take bishop as he will be in check and he cannot take black bishop as he will be check.   What to do for white?} 21. Kh2 Bxf2 {white moves Kh2. Black takes Bxf2 threatening white rook and protecting black rook} 22. Ne4 Ne3 {White advances Ne4, Black plays Ne3. (Buying time to reposition Knight)} 23. Qc1 Ng4+ {White queen retreats. Black moves Ng4. Now a much better position and checking the King} 24. Kh1 Bg2# {Checkmate! I was down -4 when the mate occurred. Hope you enjoyed the game. }
