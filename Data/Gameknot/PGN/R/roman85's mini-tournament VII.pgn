1. c4 f6 2. Nc3 g6 {I asked my opponent if he decided to invent an opening} 3. d4 Nh6 4. e4 Nf7 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Be3 O-O {you must recognize this is castling..............} 7. c5 {so i take the space...} c6 8. Bc4 e6 9. O-O d5 10. cxd6 e.p. {i prefer this to keep my bishop active, and reduce the castle structure} Nxd6 11. Bb3 Na6 {not an orthodox move.} 12. a3 Nc7 13. Qc2 Ncb5 14. Rac1 Nxc3 15. bxc3 {had to. e4 was too exposed} Nf7 {and castling again} 16. Qa2 Re8 17. c4 Bh6 {de-castling? } 18. c5 Bxe3 19. fxe3 {though I seem exposed, there is no Attack coming from black. So I multiplied my attacking points.} Qc7 20. Rf2 Kg7 21. Rcf1 Nh6 {I have to admit I didn't see it coming right} 22. Nd2 Ng4 {from now, white is also exposed to a good Attack, but precised moves gave me security} 23. Rf2f4 {of course: anything else was a bad idea as h2 is exposed and I didn't want to lose my rook.} f5 {force me to open the e column.} 24. exf5 Nxe3 {I expected exf, but black might have not seen the next move.} 25. f6+ {check! and I expected Kf8} Kh6 {?! from now, I knew I just had to keep the king far from his base. } 26. Rf1f3 {preparing check on h column.} Nd5 {?! I expected g5 27 Bc2 ... or even Nf5} 27. Rg4 {my guess the only good move here was Nxf6 to give an escape for the king. Then after that white are better because of material, but black has still some space. But I secretly hoped black could play the audacious Kh4... And then, with Kh4, I still had a great work to deal with... but...} e5 {???} 28. Rh3# {}
