[Opening "Old Indian (A54), Ukrainian variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 {Black usually chooses this order to the difficulties of the Samisch system (1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3).} 4. e4 {With this variation Black can create some counterplay. 4. Nf3, which does not fix the position in the center yet, causes Black much more difficulty.} exd4 5. Qxd4 Nc6 6. Qd2 g6 7. b3 Bg7 8. Bb2 O-O 9. Bd3 Ng4 10. Nge2 Qh4 {! Contrary to the usual "rules" of opening theory, Black, before completing his development, makes an early attack with his Queen, based on this specific position. This forces White to make an immediate decision about his position. This is where it gets wild and tactical!!} 11. Ng3 {The threat is Nxh2.  Weakening of the white squares, g3 wouldn't work.} Nge5 12. O-O f5 13. f3 {! The beginning of a profound defensive plan. After 13. f4 Ng4! is very strong since 14. h3 is impossible due to 14. ...Bd4  15. Kh1 Qxg3 16. hg Qh4 mate.} Bh6 {Black must weaken the long diagonal since otherwise there is no support for the pawn offensive f5-f4, g6-g5, g5-g4.} 14. Qd1 f4 15. Nge2 g5 16. Nd5 g4 17. g3 {! The principal link in the system of defense chosen by White.} fxg3 18. hxg3 Qh3 19. f4 {Now it Black were to play two attacking moves 19. ...NXf3  20. Kf2 Qh2 ?, the situation would change dramatically. After 21. Ke3 the white King would be sheltered safely and Black would come under an attack which would be hard to defend.} Be6 {! This indirectly safeguards the key position of the Knight of e5 and prepares a blow on f4.} 20. Bc2 {?  Better was Bb1. Black would still be better. } Rf7 21. Kf2 Qh2+ 22. Ke3 Bxd5 23. cxd5 {ed? Re8 would be very strong.} Nb4 24. Rh1 Rxf4 {!! It goes without saying that it was impossible to calculate all the likely variations over the board. It had to be intuitive. } 25. Rxh2 Rf3+ 26. Kd4 Bg7 {!! White is now in a mating net, but also has to be accurate since playing without the help of his Queen. Watch all these amazing "quiet" moves.} 27. a4 c5+ 28. dxc6 e.p. bxc6 29. Bd3 Nexd3+ 30. Kc4 d5+ {!} 31. exd5 cxd5+ 32. Kb5 Rb8+ 33. Ka5 Nc6+ {White resigns. This would be the obvious continuation.  } 34. Ka6 Nc5# {The End.. }
