1. f4 {So here's a game where i really struggled to win. I go down in material quite a bit, but through a blunder from my opponent i manage to win it. So he kick off with f4, which is rather odd opening.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 {i decided to go with the kings Indian} 3. e3 Nf6 4. d4 Bg7 5. Bd3 O-O 6. Nbd2 {I think this was not the best move he could have made. In my opinion nc3 would have been better adding pressure to my d5 pawn.} Bg4 {Just pinning the knight to the queen while developing my bishop.} 7. c3 {This was a bit passive, he could have easily played c4.} c6 {defending d5 and also making room for my queen to move.} 8. O-O Na6 {My plan was to get the knight to c7, but it never got that far} 9. h3 {unpins the knight.} Bd7 10. Ne5 {now that's a nice knight. One that is hard to get rid of.} Be6 {Didn't want to give up my lsb, though my opponent probably wasn't going to try and exchange.} 11. Bxa6 {He volunteers to give up his lsb, which is understandable considering light squares are on a bit of a lockdown. and this also wins a pawn} bxa6 12. Nxc6 Qd6 13. Ne5 {knight just went back to e5 after snapping that pawn of} Nh5 {heading towards g3} 14. g4 Ng3 15. Re1 {i think he could have played rf3 attacking the knight} f6 16. Nef3 {finally kicked the knight away} h5 17. Kg2 {This kicks the knight and protects the weak h3 pawn.} Ne4 18. gxh5 gxh5 {Here i started to feel it will be a race to your opponents king, considering our kings are rather exposed} 19. Nh2 {attacking the pawn} Bf7 {defending the pawn} 20. h4 f5 {giving room to my queen while supporting my knight.} 21. Nhf3 Be6 {aaaaaand.....} 22. Ne5 {the knight is back to where it was.} Bxe5 {i decided to get rid of it even at the cost of a pawn.} 23. fxe5 Qd7 24. Qxh5 f4 {opening c8-h3 diagonal for my bishop and queen.} 25. Qg6+ Kh8 26. Nxe4 {now i lose another pawn} dxe4 27. Qxe4 {Here i personally like my position, my pieces are alot more active than whites and i have a past f pawn} Rfg8+ {I saw that i can get a few checks in and decided to see will they lead to something more.} 28. Kf2 fxe3+ 29. Bxe3 Raf8+ 30. Ke2 Bg4+ 31. Kd2 Bf5 {just kicking the queen back a bit} 32. Qh1 {apparently not only a bit} Qb5 33. Bg5 {And this is the massive blunder which allows a mate in two} Qd3+ 34. Kc1 Qc2# {}
