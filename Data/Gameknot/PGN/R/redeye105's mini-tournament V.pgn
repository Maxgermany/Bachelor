1. d4 {queen pawn game} Nf6 2. Nf3 {my opponent apparently avoiding the nimzo  that means e6 wont be too good idea- d5 will be better} d5 3. e3 {natural development- I need to take care of my own development too  Bg4 ? I dontlike it too much since it gives him time to develope his Bishop to e2 and at the same time he will be ready to castle Lets prepare my castle with g6 } g6 4. h3 {he was probably expecting Bg4... I'll go on with my plan then and fianchetto my Bishop} Bg7 5. Bd3 {ok naturall development - time to castle } O-O 6. O-O {ok - we are both castled. Now I think it's time to start developing the queen side ... a pawn on c5 will be nice ,,, and a bishop on b7 will also be nice- that means it's time for b6!} b6 7. c3 {c3- that means his queen is about to come out , probably Qc2 will be his next move to occupy the diagonal b1-h7 with his queen and Bishop I'm not too worried about that since my king is well protected  so lets go on with the plan Bb7} Bb7 8. Re1 {the rook takes position in the center- the e pawn will be powerfull on e4 ... even more on e5... something to look after ... for noe I'm ok cause my f6 knight is taking care of it .. so that means I can go on with developing my queen side pieces  } Nbd7 9. Nbd2 {I guess Ne5 will come next - fine by me  time for c5} c5 10. b3 {so He decides to stop c4 with his b pawn. at the same time the Bishop on c1 looks better now. I think I'll counter that move with Rc8- using the semi open file to start some pressure } Rc8 11. Bb2 {another development move  c4? not a good idea at this point maybe later.. I'd love to play e5 though - so let's prepare to that - Re8} Re8 12. Bb5 {pining my knight - first attempt from my opponent to gain a small edge on the other end it gives me time to strenghten my pawn structure even more in the queen side with a6 but he will exchange and I will have to recapture with my queen and then Ne5 will give him intiative   I'll block with my Bishop Bc6} Bc6 13. Ba6 {hmmm he keeps bothering me  ok I'll run him away  Rb8 if he wont retreat then b5 and the bishop will fall} Rb8 14. Bd3 {ok so he runs  I think I can play e5 finally now } e5 15. dxe5 {OK so my opponent doesn't waste time and fight for the center  there are going to be some bullets in the air now so hold tight !!  } Nxe5 16. Nxe5 Rxe5 {I beleive c4 will come next or Nf3 still an open file in the center for my rook worth the effort  } 17. c4 {as I inticipated  now I think d4 will be a good idea  problem is that it will create an isolated d pawn  how about Rg5 ...  then d4 in the next move will gain tempo with the threat Rxg2+  if he'll see that and paly e4 then I will play d4 and lock his Bishop on b2} Rg5 18. Nf3 {oh dear  It turns out as abad mistake the previous move .... lets try to sort it out } Rh5 19. Ne5 {QD6 IS ALMOST FROCED } Qd6 20. Nxc6 Qxc6 21. cxd5 Rxd5 {ok I think I've managaed the situation Rxd5 and we're good to go } 22. Qf3 {I can't thouch the Bishop cause my queen will fall he's Bishops looks suddenly very dangerous  I'll try to exchange queens to put down the pressure  Rd6} Rd6 23. e4 Rbd8 {whie as a threaht Be5 and e5 }
