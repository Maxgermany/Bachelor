[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed"]

1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian, popular at all levels.} 2. Nc3 {Planning to play the Grand Prix attack (an early f4 against virtuallyh all systems Black can choose). The immediate 2.f4?! is not as effective since Black can immediately challenge the centre with 2...d5 and get an equal game.} a6 {!? A common move in many Sicilians. This is to stop knights or bishops from coming to b5 and to prepare a ...b5 pawn push for himself. I was not happy to see this move, since I always play the GPA with Bb5, but that's impossible now (the grand prix can be played with Bc4 as well, but I don't know those lines). Therefore, I had to change plans already.} 3. Nf3 {Therefore, I decided to switch to open Sicilians, which I played earlier in my chess career.} e6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nc6 {Black can still choose some different systems, for example the Kan or Scheveningen. This is a quite basic and flexible set-up for Black.} 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bd3 Qc7 {Both players continue with natural development.} 8. f4 {?! And there we have the first of many mistakes made by me in this tournament. This simply loses a pawn. I wanted to prevent ...Ne5, but obviously I should have castled first before playing f4.} d6 {?! Apparently my opponent didn't see it (he played really fast the whole game) or thought it was too dangerous. But if he had played 8...Nxd4 9.Bxd4 Qxf4 he would have been a pawn up. The open f-file and centralized bishop are not enough to compensate for a pawn in my opinion, especially because Black has no weaknesses \and is very solid. With this move, we get into a Scheveningen Sicilian.} 9. O-O Be7 10. Qf3 O-O 11. Rae1 {It is becoming clear that White wants to attack through the center and on the kingside and that Black's counterplay lies on the queenside. Black's position is a bit passive, but solid.} Nxd4 {This exchange is a bit strange I think. I think Black should keep the tension between these two knights, because I see no reason to exchange right now. I think something like 11...Bd7 or 11...b5 was better here.} 12. Bxd4 e5 {? This must have been the point, Black wants to gain more center control with tempo. Unfortunately it fails tactically.} 13. Be3 {?! However, I don't see it (I know, this was not my best game tactically). Strong was 13.fxe5 dxe5 14.Qg3! after which the bishop can't be taken due to the pin on the queen, while White has a strong attack on the e5 pawn which can hardly be defended (14...Bd6?? fails to 15.Rxf6! and the g-pawn is pinned so Black can't retake).} b5 14. fxe5 {Opening the f-file for my rook.} dxe5 15. Bg5 {Attacking the f6 knight and already foreseeing the following combination.} Bb7 {Probably 15...b4 was better. The game could have continued 16.Bxf6 bxc3 17.Bxe7 Qxe7 18.b3 (18.bxc3?! does not win a pawn due to 18...Qc5+ winning it back). In the game I can exchange in more favourable circumstances.} 16. Bxf6 {Not quite giving up the bishop pair for free, as we will see.} Bxf6 17. Nd5 Bxd5 {It was unnecessary to give up the bishop pair, as 17...Qc5+ (which I missed of course) 18.Kh1 Bg5 would retain it, but White's position is more active and you can't say that Black's bishops are doing very much in that position.} 18. exd5 Be7 {Temporarily loses a pawn, but probably it was necessary at some point to prevent me from sacrificing an exchange on f6 and opening up Black's kingside.} 19. Qe4 {Black can't defend the e5 pawn due to the mating threat on h7.} g6 20. Qxe5 Qxe5 21. Rxe5 Bc5+ {Activating his forces with tempo.} 22. Kh1 Bd4 {Regaining the pawn, but allowing my rook to enter the seventh rank.} 23. Re7 Bxb2 24. Be4 {? A bad move. I wanted to play d6 with tempo at some point, but now Black has a good move to get back into the game. I should have played 24.c4. Black can't allow c5 because that would give me two connected passed pawns, and I'm also threatening to win the b-pawn (the bishop is still on d3). So probably exchanging is the best option for Black. Now the c-pawn remains rather weak.} Rad8 {?! Better was 24...Rae8. I have to exchange my active rook due to the pin on the bishop and after 25.Rxe8 Rxe8 Black gets the important open e-file and my Bishop has to move again, while my active rook has been exchanged.} 25. Rc7 {I wanted to play Rc6 to help my d-pawn advance. Fritz suggests 25.g4, probably to gain some space and prevent ...f5.} Rd6 {Black stops Rc6, as 26.Rc6?! Rxc6 27.dxc6 would now leave me with an awkward pawn structure. The passed pawn on c6 is probably not as strong as it seems, because it cannot advance (on c7 it can't be defended anymore). Fritz suggests 25...f5 to scare away my bishop and gain space on the kingside (and probably also to clear the seventh rank).} 26. Rd1 {'Rooks belong behind passed pawns', but White's passed pawn can't advance and has no help from other pawns. Therefore I should have played 26.c4, according to the computer, even though my Rook has to leave the seventh rank after the pawn exchange. Note that I find this endgame quite hard to judge for myself, so I'll sometimes just give the computer's suggestion and hopefully better players than me can give me some insights on the ins and outs of this ending.} Re8 {I guess controlling the open file is important here.} 27. Bf3 Ba3 {Starts an interesting bishop manoeuvre. Fritz comes up with the counter-intuitive 27...b4, which I cannot understand at all.} 28. h3 {I wanted to give my rook the possibility of moving off the first rank. It had to stay there because of the mating threat.} Bb4 29. Rd4 Be1 {Fritz suggests 29...Ba5 but I like Black's idea.} 30. c4 {Finally this move, but at this point I think 30.g4 was better because of what follows.} Bg3 {Hmm, now there's a mating threat anyway. I think it was around this point that it became clear to me that the tables had turned and Black has the upperhand here.} 31. Rd1 {Probably 31.Re4 was also possible.} bxc4 32. Rxc4 h5 33. Rc3 {My time was running out here. I tried to make a threat (34.Bxh5 with discovered attack on the strong Black bishop on g3) but he wanted to play ...h4 anyway and this just forces him to do that.} h4 34. Kg1 {Wanting to get my king out of that tiny corner, but it can't get very far.} f5 35. Rdc1 Kg7 {Black is also activating his king and preparing a kingside assault.} 36. Rc3c6 Red8 {I don't know the purpose of this move, the rook went back a move later. Maybe he thought the rook on d6 wasn't defended but forgot about the bishop on g3.} 37. Kf1 Re8 38. Be2 {? Closing off the e-file, but probably I should not have taken the crucial decision to exchange my strong d-pawn for his a-pawn just before the time control. I create a new passed pawn, but the pawn on d5 was way stronger than the pawn on a2 will be.} Rxd5 39. Rxa6 Rd2 {White's forces lack coordination and Black is much more active. Black must be better here. Fritz suggests 39...Kh6, probably to be able to attack with the pawns on the kingside.} 40. Bf3 Rd3 41. Be2 Rde3 {The last move before the time control (my opponent had forgotten to press the clock at one moment in the game so we had to play one move extra). I had made my 41st move with 2 miinutes to spare, while my opponent had barely used an hour for his first 40 moves and still had an hour left on his clock.} 42. Rc2 Re8e4 {I expected 42...Rd8 with the threat of 43...Rd1+! 44.Bxd1 Re1# and that's also Fritz' preference.} 43. Rd6 {?? And here's the biggest blunder of the whole tournament (at least in my own games). I wanted to defend my bishop on the second rank, but I should have played Rb6 and then b2 instead of Rd6 and then d2. Up to this point I didn't do a safety check before every move. After this game I was much more careful and I tried to check before every move if it failed tactically (of course I sometimes still forgot it).} Rf4+ {?? This is the moment of mutual chess blindness referred to in the game title. I didn't realize util after the game what a big blunder I had just made and how lucky I was to have gotten away with it. The only good choice was 43...Bxd6 44.resigns.} 44. Kg1 Rf2 45. Rdd2 {Actually this was exactly what I had in mind when I played 43.Rd6??.} Kf6 46. a4 Rf4 {Apparently Black thought there was not much to do on the seventh rank. He keeps searching for the right set-up of his pieces, but meanwhile I am able to reorganize my forces and get enough counterplay to hold the draw.} 47. a5 Bf2+ 48. Kh1 Re7 {This defensive move more or less ends all hopes of winning for Black. He could still try with 48...Be1.} 49. Rca2 Rfe4 50. Bf1 Bg3 51. Rde2 {Wanting to force another exchange, because every exchange brings us closer to an ending with opposite-coloured bishops, which would be a dead draw. I still had the feeling that Black was more active so I was worse and a draw would be a good result for me. Fritz suggests the line 51.Rd1 Re1 52.Raa1 Rxd1 53.Rxd1 Re1 54.Rxe1 Bxe1 with just the ending I was hoping for. Other 51th move alternatives don't offer Black any winning chances either because of my passed a-pawn.} Re4xe2 {And now it's clear that this will be a draw. If Black wanted to try something, allowing me to exchange on e4 and then retaking with the f-pawn was the way to go. That would also give Black a passed pawn. But I don't think Black can win that ending either.} 52. Rxe2 Ra7 53. Ra2 g5 54. a6 g4 {And here my oppponent offered a draw, which I accepted. I didn't see a way to progress as long as Black keeps his rook on the a-file. Fritz says this move is an inaccuracy and suggests 55.Ra4 for me, but I don't understand how I can have any winning chances here. Anyway I thought a draw was a fair result of this game, because we both had had some winning chances (I was better in the first half of the game and my opponent was better in the second half). Overall I was happy to have drawn a player with 212 rating points more. The next game I played Black against an opponent with 1612 and that game will be annotated asap.}
