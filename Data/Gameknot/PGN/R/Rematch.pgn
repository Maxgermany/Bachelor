Bc4 {oh...dear please defend the weak member of your army ...the f-pawn.} e6 {so Mr. bishop you have not attack any more, also i open the path for my dark square bisop and queen  } 3. d4 {immediate action of white to counter attack with firm control on e4 square for his g1 knight. if i capture he does as well and further development. so i am little bit worried and think 5 min....after thinking i will decide to } Qh4 {decide to attack.

Qxe5 {oh my unprotected pawn at g7 and i am in trouble now.....if i make Qxh8 then certainly WQ goes for Qxg7and equal the material loss and my king is unprotected ...so i take 10 min to think and then decide to } Qxh1 {decide to  go with my plan by evaluating the no real threat on my king} 11.

Kg2 {Oh what is that king again move to safest place and no more check....then BQ is just there for knight safety. This is not a good thing at all to put your strongest warrior for knight safety.....but is there other way if some one thinking about Kf1 then think what happen when white move his white dark square bisop move to a3.} Qg4 {Okk for some time i prefer this} 18. f3 {oh no.....This is not a place for you black queen..ok } Qg6 {The only safe square i found with knight safety} 19. e5 {oh no dear not the safe square} f5 {one final attempt of protection} 20. exf6 e.p. {easy passent and now a clear check mate for me if i try to save knight any more to make the move f2 .......} Qxf6 {so i take the pawn} 21.

Qxh7 {nice move if you have upper hand so why you go for exchange with queen at all.......but this is a real mistake from white ......which is clear at the last} Qc5 {so now i just starting readjust himself ...but opponent has no mood to give me time for reorganize and a check storm is coming} 23.

Bd3 {and danger alarm rings, i must move my king to another position otherwise in next move white rook will reach at b5 and force me to lose my queen at the cost of a rook and light square bisop. One of my friend at gameknot tell to make this trade.....but chess player like me did not survive long with enemy queen so i refuse to for this trade and go for another walk} Ka4 {White welcome is his camp with another check} 30. Rb4+ {CHECK NUMBER 13....no other option for black} Ka3 {go for another walk} 31. Bd2 {oh little bit surprising to why not c1 why d2...and when i unlock it ...i am thinking about resign......why not i did not go with my friend suggestion...white is planning to his pawn move to c4 giving his queen way to finish the game......and this bisop move is for rook protection so if i want to go with my friend suggestion ....IS IT TOO LATE....MAY BE ........after continues thinking of more than half an hour i made..... } a5 {i sent  a emergency call to my pawn........and pawn is at right place at right time....no more relief than this when i made this game saving move......now white must rethink about his plan...} 32.

Kh3 {safe position ?......well black thought ....but i am not } d6+ {i allow my bisop to say Hello Mr. king....} 38. g4 {oh pawn protection } Bxg4+ {another nice move of the game.......one minor mistake causes black sudden death here and he well judged it ...What is that minor mistake? taking bisop with king........Think if he take with king then give another check with my queen at g2 and then only safe place for black king is h5 with no queen loss and then i slide down my rook from a8 to h8 and then subsequent move take his queen....} 39. Qxg4 {so he prefer to take with queen not so effective} Rh8+ {rook says hi king} 40.
