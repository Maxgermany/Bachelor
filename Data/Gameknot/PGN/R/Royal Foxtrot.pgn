1. e4 {Although I like strategical interesting games, this game does not have that. Instead it contains an interaction between the white queen and the black king which lasts nine moves and leads to the demise of the black queen. It is not unlike a dance - hence the title - and not devoid of some beauty. } e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 {My first try at the Bishop's Gambit variation of the King's Gambit Accepted.} Nc6 4. Nf3 {Already I have cold feet and I quickly try to get back to the Knight's Gambit (characterized by 3. Nf3 instead of 3. Bc4) of the KGA with which I am much more familiar.} g5 5. d4 {This position is normally reached via 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 Nc6 and black's 4-th move defines the Blachly Gambit (Blachly Defense would have been more appropriate). The stem game is Paulsen-Blachly, New York 1857.} g4 6. c3 {The sacrifice of Nf3 is quite similar to the Muzio gambit and the goal is an attack over the f-file - the main strategical theme of the King's Gambit. A strong center is also of importance, hence the support of d4 with c3.} gxf3 7. O-O {The rook wants to be on the soon to be opened f-file. Note that the black pawn which comes on g2 forms a strong shield for the white king.} fxg2 8. Bxf7+ {The last preparation to open the f-file, similar to the so called "Wild Muzio". White gets this highway into the black position at the cost of a mere two minor pieces!   In his youth Steinitz loved attacking games. Here is a wonderful miniature where he dispatches his adversary with this opening:  [Site "Vienna"] [Date "1860.??.??"] [White "Wilhelm Steinitz"] [Black "Lang"]  1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

Nc5  1-0 } Ke7 {Black declines to take the bait.} 9. Rxf4 {The rook - being under attack from g2 - has the honour of opening the f-file.} Bh6 {Black develops and wants to trade material. That is often a good idea in the defense against this opening: White is in danger of running out of attacking pieces. For instance it takes quite a while before the white knight can join the raiding party (a disadvantage of 6. c3). } 10. Rf2 Bxc1 11. Qxc1 Nf6 {After 11. ... d6 the black king is caught in a mating net starting with 12. Qg5 . And after 11. ... d5 the white queen has 12. Qg5  and 13. Qg7 snaring a piece without relinquishing the attack. So 11. .. Nf6 looks like the best defense.} 12. Bd5 {12. Bd5 hoping for another shot at Qg5  if black is tempted to exchange more material. That would allow to get the black king in the open and in the reach of the reserves.} Rf8 {Black again refuses the bait... At this point I am thinking that I will be lucky if I escape defeat with a perpetual. If black gets d7-d6 in, it is over for white. This last point illustrates the importance of a single tempo in open games like this.} 13. e5 {Attempting to get the perpetual. } Nxd5 {This time black needs to accept the sacrifice of the white bishop as refusal loses.} 14. Qg5+ {Finally the main theme of this annotated game: The royal dance is starting!! The black king can not go to e6 as then 15. Qg4 Ke7 16. Qg7  wins the black rook (and also the queen since the escape Qh4 leads to the fall of the black monarch). On 14. ... Nf6 there follows 15. exf6  and the black king is toast, e.g. 15. .. Kf7 16. Qg7  Ke6 17. Re2  Kd5 18. Qg5  Kc4 19. b3  Kd3 20. Qd2#} Ke8 15. Qh5+ {If the white queen could now have given check on g6, then Qg7  with attack on Rf8 would be possible. So here is the idea: Move the dance to the h-file, eliminate h7 and then bring the dance back to the g-file.} Ke7 16. Qxh7+ {The first goal was easily obtained, now we need to switch back to the g-file while keeping in contact with the black king.} Ke6 17. Qh3+ {A quick trot to h3} Ke7 18. Qh4+ {Step} Ke8 19. Qh5+ {Step} Ke7 20. Qg5+ {Trot to the g-file} Ke8 21. Qg6+ {Step} Ke7 22. Qg7+ {Step. The end of the dance, white now wins the black queen.} Ke6 23. Rxf8 {The black queen has to give her life as her king is in a mating net.} Qxf8 24. Qxf8 {Black's forces are virtually undeveloped, white's reserves have lots of time to come into action.} Nxe5 {Deperation... The rest was played quickly and may not be the most efficient execution by the white forces. But it does not really matter anymore, black is lost anyway.} 25. dxe5 b5 26. Nd2 Bb7 27. Qh6+ Kf7 28. Re1 Rf8 {Black is shooting for a last trick: Protect the g2 pawn by his bishop, bring the rook to the f-file and hope that white leaves the backrank unprotected.} 29. e6+ dxe6 30. Rxe6 Rg8 31. Nf3 {White has activated his forces and opened the position with 29. e6 . I got the feeling there should be a fast win here, but settled for exchanging of the rooks - killing any counter-threats.} Rg7 32. Ne5+ Kf8 33. Re8+ Kxe8 34. Qxg7 {After the exchange of the rooks, the queen and her shepherd knight will corral the black king. The skills of queen and knight are complementary and they form a good team. } Bc6 35. Qf7+ Kd8 36. Nxc6+ Kc8 37. Qxd5 a6 38. Ne7+ Kb8 39. Qc6 b4 40. Qxa6 c5 41. Qb6+ Ka8 42. Nc6 bxc3 43. Qa7# {Last embrace of the dance partners and curtains, I hope you enjoyed the show.}
