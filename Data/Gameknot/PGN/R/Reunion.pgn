[Opening "QGD (D08), Albin counter-gambit"]

1. d4 {So I started with my usual. I should perhaps add that I am annotating the game on the morning after. I am pretty sure of all the moves, but I may have got them in the wrong order! Wine was served with the lunch, which may explain the poor quality of this game! We were also moving quite fast - just like we used to have a quick game after lunch when we were students together!} d5 {He replies in kind.} 2. c4 {I go into the Queen's Gambit.} e5 {He replies with the Albin's Counter Gambit! He always played this as a child, but it had slipped my mind.} 3. dxe5 {So I take.} d4 {He advances. The careless move 4.e3? can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3 6.Bxb4?? is a blunderâ€”6...exf2+ 7.Ke2 fxg1=N+! and Black wins. The Lasker Trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion in practical play.} 4. Nf3 {So I played this.} Bb4+ {This is unusual. Black normally plays c5 or Nc6. Michael aims for c5, but he wants to exchange black square bishops first, rather than be left with a bishop on f8 restricted by the pawn on c5.} 5. Bd2 {I figure that exchanges help me as I am a pawn up.} Bxd2+ {He takes.} 6. Nbxd2 {I develop my knight.} c5 {He continues with his plan.} 7. g3 {Development of the Bf1 to g2 is very common in this opening.} Nc6 {Michael develops.} 8. Bg2 {So do I.} f6 {Black turns it into a proper gambit, rather than try to regain the pawn.} 9. exf6 {So I take.} Nxf6 {He takes back.} 10. O-O {I castle.} O-O {So does he.} 11. Re1 {I have a plan to get rid of his powerful pawn on d5.} Bf5 {He develops.} 12. e3 {I continue with my plan.} dxe3 {He takes. I rather expected d4-d3.} 13. Rxe3 {I take back. I think I am a clear pawn up now.} Qd7 {He develops his queen, planning to bring his rook a8 into play.} 14. Ng5 {I plan to bring a knight to e4, to exchange pieces.} Bg4 {He hits my queen.} 15. Bxc6 {This is probably a mistake, by bishop is probably better than his knight. Now he originally recaptured with his pawn, saying he had to take that way. I asked why. He replied that that I could just take his bishop with my rook on g5. I pointed out that although it was a rook with a piece of paper round it, it was in fact a knight! I allowed his to take back the pawn capture and take with the queen instead.} Qxc6 {White now has very weak squares round the king, but I don't think black can exploit it.} 16. Qc2 {I move my queen which was attacked.} Rae8 {He completes his development.} 17. Nge4 {I continue with my plan.} Nxe4 {He takes.} 18. Rxe4 {I take back, but this is a massive mistake, losing all my advantage.} Bf5 {Because after this move black wins the exchange, rook for bishop. Although white has a pawn for it, it is not enough. Michael very sportingly offered a draw here, which of course I accepted. It was time for us to go on a coach tour of Chester. This was followed by dinner at night, and the conclusion to a lovely reunion day! Many thanks for reading this, please rate it on the star system, and leave a comment or two!}
