1. d4 {I am Black.} c5 {The Benoni Defense. I counterattack White's centre pawn with a pawn from the flank.} 2. c3 {This move and e3 are the safest responses, but they are also passive and let Black get an equal position. 2.d5 is the sharpest move for White.} Nf6 {Controlling e4} 3. Nf3 e6 4. g3 d5 {Not a necessary move. I thought 4...b6 was better.} 5. Bg2 Bd7 {My plan was to control the queenside and advance my pawns there, but I thought 5... b5 was better, then developing my bishop to b7, where it controls the important e4 square.} 6. O-O b5 7. Nbd2 a5 8. Re1 c4 9. e4 {White is breaking through in the center.} dxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. Rxe4 Bc6 12. Re1 Be7 {I'm a little behind in development, so I need to castle as soon as possible, something I failed to do and almost ended up losing.} 13. Ne5 {Double attack on my bishop.} Bxg2 14. Kxg2 Qd5+ {I shouldn't be offering to trade queens because my queenside pawns are overextended, which can become weak in the endgame if I trade queens.} 15. Qf3 Qxf3+ 16. Nxf3 Nd7 {I kept delaying castling, and got into a bad position.} 17. Bf4 Nb6 {I couldn't find a good plan here, so I'm just positioning my knight.} 18. Bg5 {White wants to trade his bad bishop for my good bishop.} Ra7 {Taking and castling was probably better.} 19. Bxe7 Rxe7 20. Re5 {My weak pawns are under heavy fire.} Nd5 {I thought my position was solid here, but White's next move made me uncomfortable.} 21. Rae1 {I shouldn't have delayed castling for so long. Now I can't castle because my pawn will be pinned to my rook, so 22.Rxd5 wins my knight} h5 {My plan was to get my rook to f5, because the side with less maneuvering space should trade pieces.} 22. Nd2 Rh6 23. a4 {White is reminding me of my weak queenside pawns.} Rg6 {A cheap trick, I am threatening to play Nf4  followed by Nd3 forking the rooks.} 24. Kf3 Rf6+ 25. Kg2 Rf5 {I could've repeated the position with Rg6, but Black obviously isn't going to fall for my trick, so I should continue with my plan to trade rooks.} 26. Rxf5 exf5 27. Rxe7+ Kxe7 28. axb5 Nb6 {I am down a pawn in the endgame, but I still have a chance to swindle White becuase I exploit the fact that my king is closer to the centre, an important rule in endgames is ACTIVE pieces. Even kings.} 29. Kf3 Kf6 {I must not let White get to my queenside becuase my knight is the only thing stopping his passed pawn.} 30. h4 g5 31. hxg5+ Kxg5 32. Kg2 a4 {I'm just wasting moves waiting to see what White will do. I was hoping I could keep White's king out of the game and get a draw, but ended up getting more than I bargained for.} 33. f4+ Kg6 {If I play 33...Kg4, then White plays Nf1 threatening Nh2#, and can relocate his knight to the more active e3 post.} 34. Kf2 Kf6 {The only way White can win is if he gets his king active, and the only way to do that is to get it to b4.} 35. Ke2 Kg6 {Now if White keeps heading for the queenside, then I play h4 Kh5 and break through the kingside with my king.} 36. Nf3 {White has stopped h4, but relieves the pressure on my c-pawn.} Kf6 37. Kd2 {Heading to the queenside.} Ke6 38. Nh4 Kd5 {This was a very tough decision. White's king is going to the queenside, so the only way I  can hold on is if I sacrifice f5 to try to break through the kingside, possibly creating a passed h-pawn, forcing White to sacrifice his knight for it, letting me eat the rest of White's pawns with my mobil knight, and go on to win by passing my c or a-pawn.} 39. Nxf5 Ke4 40. Nh4 {I'm threatening to intrude to f3 where White's kingside will die, so White must put his knight out of the game.} f6 {Another waiting move.} 41. Ke2 {White wants to stop Kf3 and get his knight back into play, which was the correct way to win, but White changed his mind later.} Nd5 42. Kd2 Nb6 43. Ke2 Nd5 {I want to draw the game by repitition.} 44. Kd1 {Of course White doesn't want a draw being 2 pawns up, but he is deactivating his king.} Ke3 {My pieces are more active than Blacks, so I had hope of getting a draw, but never dreamed that I would win this.} 45. Nf5+ {White's knight is active now, but he lets me cramp his king.} Kd3 46. Kc1 Nb6 {I'm waiting to see if White can improve his position and win. I don't have anything else to do.} 47. Ng7 a3 {A desperate attempt to create a passed pawn. After bxa3 Kxc3 the winner is unclear, becuase White has a passed d-pawn and I have weak kingside pawns, but I have a passed c-pawn I can try to help promote with my knight and king. But of course White wouldn't want to go into a complicated variation when he's winning.} 48. Kb1 {White stops a2, which would've won for me.} axb2 49. Kxb2 {If White plays 49. Nxh5, then 49...Kxc3 results in another complicated unclear position, because it's very hard for a human to calculate many different multi-move variations and keep them track of them all. White avoids the complicated variation here, but now he gives me a winning position.} Na4+ {My c-pawn promotion plan can be carried out faster than White's because I can move with tempo.} 50. Kc1 Nxc3 {My chances of swindling White are increasing now. White's best chance to survive is to activate his knight, but his next move is hasty, so I get a nice easy win.} 51. b6 {A terrible blunder, White has overlooked my tactics.} Ne2+ {I can help to advance my passed pawn with tempo because of White's weak king.} 52. Kb1 {All other king moves are equally losing.} c3 53. b7 c2+ 54. Ka2 c1=Q 55. b8=Q Nc3+ 56. Kb3 Qb1+ 57. Ka3 Qxb8 {White resigned. His king will be mated in a few moves. He should've placed his pieces more actively in the endgame. My king and knight were more active than his, so I could promote my pawn faster.}
