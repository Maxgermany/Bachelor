[Opening "Beefeater defence (A40)"]

1. d4 g6 {Here I'm playing black with the modern defense. It's a blitz game timed 5min+15.} 2. c4 Bg7 3. e4 {White want to transpose it to a normal King's Indian game.} d6 4. Nc3 e5 {Continuation of my plan.} 5. d5 Nf6 {Now it looklike really to a King's Indian game.} 6. Bg5 O-O 7. Be2 c6 {Trying to open the queen side.} 8. Nf3 cxd5 9. cxd5 {Pawn exchange. Now I've got some space.} h6 {Probably not the best move. But I wanted to try to expand my king side to test it! Anyway d and e file closing some space for white, so there's not that much problems doing so (it sometime happen in higher ranking). Maybe it would have been wiser to wait until white have castled before doing it.} 10. Bh4 g5 11. Bg3 {Continuation of my plan.} Nh5 {Now the bishop have no issues.} 12. Qd2 {Probably thinking to castle on the queen side + his queen is now ready to get the g pawn.} Bf6 13. Ng1 {The castle on the king side is cancelled for now.} Nf4 {Ready to take the g2 pawn and giving some space to move my h pawn.} 14. Bxf4 {White is taking.  Bf1 would have been better I think.} exf4 {Blocking the development for white and giving an open line for my bishop. It sure this plan have some risks.} 15. g3 Be5 16. gxf4 Bxf4 {Now my bishop is almost immovable and not only I'm hunting the queen but I'm blocking the way for a castle on the queen side.} 17. Qd3 Qb6 {Threatening b2 with my queen.Maybe it would have been better for me to move my knight.} 18. b3 Qb4 {Pinning the knight.} 19. h4 {! Maybe he should have done it sooner.} Be5 {Ignoring the move and making more pressure on the knight.} 20. Rc1 Qa3 {Threatening the rook.} 21. Qc2 Bf4 {The rook again.} 22. Rb1 f6 {Protecting my g pawn.} 23. hxg5 hxg5 {Now white have some space to reach my king. However most of his pieces are on his queen side. White still got the advantage. His king is blocked on the middle but almost all his pieces are developped.} 24. Nf3 {e5! and I think white would have won here. } Bg4 {Now I've got the chance to move my bishop on a good position, giving space for my rook.} 25. Nd4 Bxe2 26. Ndxe2 Be5 {Blocking the e pawn and treathening the knight.} 27. Rg1 {? White is losing tempo here.} Rc8 {Continuation of my plan. Now the queen is pinned.} 28. Rc1 Qb4 {More pressure+ pinning the king.} 29. f4 {Gaving me no choice to exchange the pieces.} Bxc3+ 30. Nxc3 Rxc3 {! Risked move but gave a chance to grab some of white pawns. My king have a bad defense and I'm fighting 2 rook+1 queen while my rook is still blocked!} 31. Qxc3 Qxe4+ {Either way the king go, I can take another pawn.} 32. Kd1 Qxd5+ 33. Kc2 {My queen is in good position to protect the g pawn.} Nc6 {Developping finally my pieces. It was about time.} 34. Rgd1 {fxg5 would have been really better for white. It's nice to make a check or hunt the queen but it's not that who's always give you the best position.} Qf5+ 35. Kb2 Qxf4 {Now all his pawns have got grabbed. } 36. Rdf1 {! Nice now he's in good position to get my f pawn.} Qe5 {! Forcing a queen exchange + protecting my f pawn.} 37. Rce1 {Finally Rxf6 would have been better for white here.} Qxc3+ 38. Kxc3 Kf7 {Protecting the e file and my f pawn.} 39. Rf5 Rc8 {Thinking to do Ne7 after.} 40. Kb2 {The only good move.} Nd4 {Well I don't like this move. Kg6 + Rf8 would have been the best continuation for black I think. Rd5 and white would have got a nice game. Don't forget it's a blitz game.} 41. Rf2 {White still got in head to pierce my f pawn.} Rd8 {Ne6!} 42. Ref1 f5 {I don't see another way to save my pawn. } 43. Rf2xf5+ {?? Now white just lost his advantage. Rd1 would have been the best way to continue.} Nxf5 44. Rxf5+ Kg6 {Well white have no chance to win this now. Probably hoping that I'm going to make a mistake. } 45. Rd5 Kh5 46. a4 Kh4 {going to promote my g pawn. } 47. Rf5 Rd7 {Protecting my a and b pawns.} 48. Kc3 g4 49. Kd2 g3 50. Ke2 Kh3 51. Kf1 d5 {Can't continue with my g pawn or white could go for a draw I think. } 52. Kg1 d4 53. Rh5+ {It's now practically impossible to block all my pawns now. } Kg4 54. Re5 d3 55. Re1 d2 56. Rd1 Kh3 57. a5 g2 {Now white is almost in a zugzwang position.} 58. b4 Rf7 {white can't take my d pawn or he is gonna get mated. } 59. b5 Rf1+ {forcing the exchange of rooks.} 60. Rxf1 gxf1=Q+ {Taking and promoting.} 61. Kxf1 d1=Q+ {Promoting again.} 62. Kf2 Qd3 {White resigned here! I have taken some risks but it was fun.}
