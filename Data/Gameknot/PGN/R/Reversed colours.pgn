1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. dxe6 {White omits here Bb4+, his best repy. } Bxe6 5. Be2 c6 {I decided to go for a simple developement line.} 6. d3 Bd6 7. h3 {Play this only if forced to, and better as a response than profilactic... anyway, it's in white's agenda.} h6 {...so is this one. In fact, Ng5 is a nasty threat: I can't allow Ne6 to be exchanged by the N, leaving a poor pawn there. } 8. O-O Qc7 9. Nbd2 Nbd7 {White is slow in developement, so I can reach one by one all my agenda's moves.} 10. Re1 O-O-O {I will suffer from a white pawn's storm, but - specially in this white line - this will take more time than my own attack. } 11. Nf1 {Interesting defensive move, opening the way for the dsb. This will be slow, so let's speed it up!} g5 {White liked to play as black, and his desire is honoured.} 12. Nf3h2 {Another good defensive move, that makes me wonder how to break in. My pawns have to advance further, under the fire of white's B. I need h5 to prevent a piece to land on g4, to make impossible for white to play h5 (blocking the column) and assuring that g5 would have openend the column. I can't avoid right now his pieces to go to g5: the only thing I can do is to sac the g pawn (12... g5) and only after play Rg8, h5 etc. It was a blitz, so...} Rdg8 {I can play h5 now, but I am allowing...} 13. Ng4 h5 14. Nxf6 Nxf6 {h5 goal, reached. Now, before g4, I have to push to h4, as before...} 15. Bd2 {White leaves it to me... well... it does threat something, I overlooked.} h4 16. Bc3 {The normal move is Rh6, and it is probably the only and the best. } Qd8 {My force on h2 is not really useful right now. Still, a horrible move. } 17. Bxf6 {...but my opponent made it a good one. Now my Q is again on an active spot, looking to f2.} Qxf6 18. Bg4 {...and this is the price for my premature h4. Now I am under pressure, and I have to be very calm to defend. My Q on f6 comes to be a real annoyance, blocking my f pawn when needed. } Rge8 {My attack being blocked, my R has to return to duty. } 19. Bxe6+ {White is happy with exchanging down and go to the endgame. } Rxe6 20. Qg4 Rhe8 21. c3 {I wouldn't have taken the pawn: white correctly spotted Bc5, my next move, attacking f2. In this way, he prevents it. } Kc7 {Unpinning the R. } 22. Rxe6 Rxe6 23. Ne3 {This N goes to f5, he wants to take my B. I don't want to take it off the diag so easily. } Qg6 {Threat on d3 pending after the N jumps. } 24. Qf5 {I can play this, but I won't exchange Q so easily. Just let me rearrange.} Qg7 25. Kf1 {This is a plain loss of tempo, and besides, it gives me chances. } Rf6 {Now I threat Bg3. But...} 26. Qa5+ {This is nasty, too. If Kb8, Qd8# If b6, Qxh7+.} Kc8 27. Ng4 {I should have sacrified on g5 before, no doubt. This square is my nightmare...} Rf4 28. Qxa7 Qg6 {Qh8+ doesn't worry me... still.} 29. Qe3 {Qe8+, Kc7 leaves WQ just hanging over there. If Re1 is not played, of course.} Qf5 {Increasing my pressure on f2. What else?} 30. Re1 Kc7 {No check if the Q leaves, and Qxd3+ would follow. } 31. f3 {Solving his f2 problem at the cost of g3 for my lsb. Take note. } Ra4 {This is not to attack the pawn, but to make room for my B. Of course, I can't move it there now, or checks will start. But...} 32. a3 Ra5 {White should be able to win this by pushing those pawns, but I have to hope for a weakness.} 33. d4 {Preparing Ne5, probably. } Rb5 {Just inviting him to block my R with b4. Maybe I should have gone c5 instead. } 34. Re2 {Wow! Look well to this move, and try to understand why this is a blunder. } Qb1+ {This seems to be a naive check, but after Re1, Qxb7, winning a pawn and opening the way for a massive penetration. White saw all that, and unfortunately played the alternate move too quickly, allowing a splendid...} 35. Kf2 Bg3# {...mate! I hope you enjoyed this one. White made some mistake (so did I!), but overall he played very intelligent defensive moves in many occasions, don't falling in easy traps. }
