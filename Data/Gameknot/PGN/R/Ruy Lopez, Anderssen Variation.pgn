1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {I've tried the Old Stenitz (3...d6) as a regular opponent plays it with some success. But I always seem to get a poor game from it, so I stick to a mainline.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 {Again, I've come untsuck with the Open Defence (5...Nxe4) though an opponent who played it against me won comfortably. Maybe I just don't have the right temperament?!} 6. Re1 b5 {Time to drive away the Bishop.} 7. Bb3 d6 {And add support to my e-pawn and release my light-squared Bishop.} 8. c3 {Preparing to hit the centre.} O-O {All very mainline so far.} 9. h3 {White has to decide whether to use a tempo to prevent the 9...Bg4 pin, and here he does.} Bb7 {Since I can't pin the Knight I go for the long diagonal. Fischer, incidentally, considered this move too passive, and a premature commitment for the Bishop, with 9...Na5 10.Bc2 c5 being more usual. But I don't like putting my Knight on a5 and driving the Bishop to where it wants to go anyway. And where else is my light-squared Bishop going to go? Tsk, what does Bobby know?} 10. Bc2 {My Knight remains stubbornly on c3, so the Bishop goes to c2 anyway. He could have gone for the centre right away with 10.d4, when I may well have had to play 10...Na5 to get my c-pawn challenging the centre.} Nb8 {Since White hasn't played 10.d4 and 10...Na5 is rather pointless now I decide to retreat the Knight to enable my c-pawn to advance. It's headed for d7, where it can support my pawn, when it gets to c5, and also defend my e-pawn.} 11. d4 Nbd7 {I have rather a cramped position. Some typically Lopez shufflin follows...} 12. Nbd2 {With a pawn on c3 the Knight has to go via d2 and f1 to get to a decent position, blocking the dark-squared Bishop in the process.} c5 {I feel I must challenge the centre, the pricve being that backward d-pawn.} 13. d5 {I'm not sure this is White's best plan; it blocks my light-squared Bishop (Bobby was right after all) but doesn't make it easy for White's own light-squared Bishop to get into play, since the centre is rather blocked.} c4 {Getting myself a nice pawn chain and (I thought) a nice post for my Knight.} 14. Nf1 {White carries on with the laborious Lopez set-up.} Nc5 {I take up my post. For some reason I didn't think White would try to drive it away with b4.} 15. Ng3 {Indeed, he gets his Knight over to the K-side ready to take part in an attack.} Bc8 {Yes, Bobby was right; I should have left the Bishop here until I had a better square for it. But returning to base now allows White to create a problem for me.} 16. b4 Ncd7 {I shy away from opening the c-file and return the Knight. I have wasted far too many moves, but fortunately that White pawn on e4 is rather cramping White's game.} 17. Nf5 {I'm not sure where this is headed; I'm probably okay with giving up my rather useless Bishop (the one on e7 not the equally useless one on f8) - maybe this is the start of an attack on weak d-pawn?} Re8 {If White doesn't take the Bishop (and the Knight would have made 5 moves to take a piece that's moved once if he does) I intend to get the Bishop back to base on f1. It's very defensive play, but I have been trounced in the Lopez with K-side attacks.} 18. Ng5 {Looking rather dangerous now, and releasing the diagonal for the Queen. } Bf8 {At least g7 is defended.} 19. a4 {White switches sides and is tying me in all sorts of knots. I really don't want to allow the light-squared Bishop in by capturing on a4, but my b-pawn is rather hanging since my Rook on a8 is undefended. There's only one thing for it....} h6 {First drive away the Knight; I don't want to be fighting on both sides. At this, and other times, I was wary of a piece sacrfice by taking this advanced h-pawn. But I don't think it works here...} 20. Nf3 {The Knight retreats} Bb7 {And my Bishop goes back to its other useless square.} 21. Nf3h4 {White tries another route.} Nh7 {Allowing the Knight on d7 to go to f6. And revealing a threat to White's own over-eager Knight.} 22. Nf3 Ndf6 {I have, I think, a solid defence!} 23. Be3 {Time for more position juggling; I want to get my Bishop into the game, which means moving my Queen so my Q-Rook is defended. But I really don't fancy White's Bishop going to b6, if that's his idea.} Qc7 {So I stay on the same diagonal.} 24. Nh2 {Another try, this time allowing the Queen to join an attack} Reb8 {I can't see any other option to get my Bishop into play (I should have listened to Bobby)} 25. Ng4 {Looking to remove on defender, I guess.} Bc8 {Finally. Back where it started for the second time. As is my other Bishop! But that one is at least serving a useful purpose in case of that piece sacrifice on h6.} 26. Nxf6+ Nxf6 {Now White has only one Knight defending to think about.} 27. Qf3 Bxf5 {I've had it with this Bishop - it's been useless from the start. Time fo it to go.} 28. Qxf5 {I wondered whether, as ugly as it would have looked, recapturing with the pawn would have given White better chances?} Qd7 {Offering an exchange, since my Queen is proving as useless as my Bishop was.} 29. Qf3 {White declines, though with the two Bishops he might have done better exchanging?} Be7 {I want to get my Bishop onto g5 if I can; White's attack is starting to look threatening. } 30. Qg3 {Since the Bishop is no longer protecting g7 the awful threat of 31.Bxh6 looms.} Nh5 {I defend and drive away the Queen.} 31. Qf3 Nf6 {And return to f6 after the threat has gone. I wondered if White would repeat moves here; I'd have probably been happy with a draw at this point; I've had little of the game.} 32. g4 {Instead, and maybe due to frustration, he launches a pawn advance. I'm really not so sure about this?} Nh7 {Continuing to control g5.} 33. Qg3 {Preparing to advance the f-pawn too, I thought.} Bg5 {Time to exchange Bishops; it has nowhere to go, though whether exchanging was best for White I am not sure; had I exchanged it would have rather opened the game up for him.} 34. f4 {I'd overlooked that this could be played even with my Bishop on g5. I don't have much choice.} exf4 35. Bxf4 Bxf4 36. Qxf4 {Now that d-pawn is looking vulnerable, and White has the file half-open to attack f7.} Ng5 {Threatening a winning fork on h3 and attacking the e-pawn.} 37. Qg3 Rbe8 {Now I start to build up pieces against White's e-pawn, and suddenly it's that pawn that looks vulnerable.} 38. h4 Nh7 {The Knight is driven back though. But it can re-route to f6.} 39. a5 {At the time I thought this an error, even the game's turning point; I expected 39.e5, forcing (?) 39...dxe5 and leaving White with a passed pawn. But after 40.Rxe5 Rxe5 41.Qxe5 Qxg4+ is surely compensation? Anyway, the Q-side is closed and my Rook can move from a8. But first...} Re5 {That pawn is going no further; hard to see how this Rook can be easily dislodged?} 40. Ref1 {White wants to attack the f-pawn, but this just removes a defender of his own pawn.} Nf6 {And I can block the attack on the f-pawn and build up again on the e-pawn. The game is building up to crisis point.} 41. Rf4 {With the Rook here White can defend on e1 with the other Rook.} Rae8 {Except now 42.Re1 doesn't work because of 42...Nxd5 when the e-pawn is pinned.} 42. Raf1 {Seems White is giving up his pawn for an attack of his own.} Nxe4 {A Knight loose in your defence when the Queen and both Rooks are about can be lethal if you're not careful.} 43. Bxe4 {I imagine White is as happy to get rid of this Bishop as I was to get rid of mine.} Re5xe4 44. Qf3 {Now the Queen joins in and it looks like a heavy attack on f7.} Re4e7 {I kept looking at Qa7+ but I couldn't see anything to follow up. This seemed the safest option.} 45. Rf5 {Possibly getting ready to advance the g-pawn? At present I can't see how White can win that f-pawn.} Re7e1 {I could have done this the move before, but I didn't think of it: 46.Rxf7 Rxf1+ followed by 47...Qxf7 is nice.} 46. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 47. Kf2 {I thought about 47...Rc1 but that seemed to take the Rook out of the game.} Qe7 {Instead, I keep the White King penned in. I realise that White can now win his pawn back...} 48. Rxf7 {And he does.} Qxf7 {But surely loses the game in doing so? (Actually, 48...Qxh4+ would have won the game more quickly; 49.Qg3 Rf1 50.Kxf1 Qxg3)} 49. Qxf7+ Kxf7 50. Kxe1 Kf6 {That pawn on d5 is dead.} 51. Ke2 Ke5 52. Ke3 Kxd5 53. Kf4 Ke6 {I still need to be a little careful of the White King penetrating.} 54. h5 d5 55. Ke3 Ke5 56. Kf3 d4 {I really can't see how he can stop me now.} 57. cxd4+ Kxd4 58. Kf4 {He can't stop my pawn, so is hoping for some kind of blunder to let him in...} c3 59. g5 c2 {No reason to worry about his pawns though. And he resigned.}
