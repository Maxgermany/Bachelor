[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C64), classical defence, Zaitsev variation"]

1. e4 {Quite a recent game from a mini-tournament, as is clear from the title.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez, the most common king pawn opening at the GM level, and one of the oldest too!} Bc5 {The Cordel Defence.} 4. O-O {The Zaitsev Variation. This is all main line.} Nd4 5. Nxd4 Bxd4 6. c3 {6.c3 supports the pawn move 7.d4. This is a common move in many king pawn openings, and White was probably planning this. Here it has the added bonus of attacking the bishop and preventing Black from trying to get any more control over d4.} Bb6 7. d4 c6 {As Black, I might play 7...c5 and put pressure on White's pawn on d4. That might lead to a closed Benoni-type position forming. But 7...c6 looks like a strong move, to White's light-squared bishop away and then play 8...d5 to stake a claim equal to White's in the centre.} 8. Bc4 d5 {A good opposition to White's strong centre. Since Black is attacking both White's bishop and his e-pawn, White pretty well has to play 9.exd5 to avoid the total collapse of his pawn centre.} 9. exd5 cxd5 10. Bb3 exd4 11. cxd4 {The centre has completely opened up, and to me it looks as though a race to get rooks onto the open c- and e-files will soon start. Since White has already castled, he may hold the advantage in such a race.} Nf6 12. Bg5 {I would personally have preferred 12.Re1 , getting a rook onto the open e-file. As he is giving check, White can then play 13.Bg5.} h6 13. Bh4 g5 14. Bg3 Bg4 {Black is preventing White from having any free moves to get that rook on e1 by constantly keeping White on his toes with these little aggressive moves.} 15. Qd3 O-O {Black has caught up and in fact gained a slight lead (White's undeveloped knight is in the way of his queenside rook) in what I will call the "Rook Race". However, Black has payed a hefty price: his castled king is completely exposed and White's queen has a nice diagonal leading straight into his king's position. If White can chase away or eliminate Black's knight, say with Be5, and then put his bishop behind his queen with Bc2, he has a powerful attack.} 16. Be5 Re8 17. Bxf6 Qxf6 18. Nc3 {I would definitely have played 18.Bc2, which I think leaves White with a winning attack. White can at the very least pick up an extra pawn after 18...Qg6 19.Qxg6  fxg6 20.Bxg6.} Bxd4 {Instead, it is White who loses the pawn! But White can still go for that attack...} 19. Bxd5 {Apparently not. White chooses to grab the pawn on d5 instead.} Bxc3 20. bxc3 Rad8 {Black has now won the Rook Race, as White has not touched his rooks since castling. Now Black has rooks on both the open centre files, on d8 and e8, one of which has a potentially devastating pin on White's bishop and the other of which could support 21...Be2, forking White's queen and rook. By contrast, White's rooks are conveniently placed right behind pawns and nearer the edges, on a1 and f1.} 21. c4 Be2 {White could have both saved the bishop and prevented the fork with, say, 21.Qd4. Now he will lose material.} 22. Qg3 Bxf1 23. Rxf1 Re7 {Black is preparing to form a rook "battery" - his rooks will be positioned on e7 and e8, radiating power down that open central e-file.} 24. a4 b6 25. h4 {A "just in case" escape route for White's king is formed.} Rde8 {And Black puts that rook in a powerful position behind the other, preventing anything of White's from going anywhere near the e-file for the moment.} 26. f4 Qd4+ 27. Kh2 Re7e3 {Black is coming in to the attack!} 28. Qg4 Re3e1 29. Qh5 {White puts his queen right out of the action, just when it is most needed for Black's king's defence.} Qf6 30. hxg5 hxg5 31. Rxe1 Rxe1 {The rooks are exchanged off, which does not immediately affect either side but consolidates Black's material advantage.} 32. Qg4 Qxf4+ 33. Qxf4 gxf4 {Another exchange. White should not be exchanging when Black is ahead on material: he should be COMPLICATING the board.} 34. Bf3 Kg7 35. g3 fxg3+ 36. Kxg3 f5 37. Kf4 Kf6 38. Bc6 Rf1+ 39. Ke3 Ke5 {Black is an exchange up, AND has a passed pawn. Things are looking bleak for White.} 40. Bb5 f4+ 41. Kd2 Kd4 {Black's king is constantly opposing White's king, holding him back and pushing him back at every opportunity.} 42. c5 bxc5 43. Bxf1 a5 {Ooooooops. Black didn't (I think!) notice that discovered attack. But all is nowhere near lost - he has two passed pawns to White's bishop.} 44. Bb5 c4 45. Bc6 c3+ 46. Kc2 Kc5 47. Be8 Kb4 48. Bc6 Kc5 49. Be8 f3 {Black ends this repetitive sequence with a decisive pawn move. That bishop of White's is beginning to look slightly overworked.} 50. Bb5 Kb4 51. Kc1 f2 52. Kc2 {White's bishop is firmly locked in place, holding back Black's f-pawn and defending White's a-pawn.} f1=Q 53. Bxf1 Kxa4 54. Kxc3 {Game drawn. Well, not yet, but unless White does something really silly the game has to be drawn. Black cannot get his king off the a-file. It is White's turn to make use of the opposition between two kings!} Ka3 55. Bb5 Ka2 56. Kc4 Kb2 57. Ba4 Ka3 58. Bb3 a4 59. Bxa4 {And the game is drawn. I think this is a rather interesting game to look at overall.}
