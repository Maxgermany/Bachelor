1. e4 {Good ol' e4.} g6 {A somewhat unusual response.  The database calls this "B06: Robatsch (modern) defence."} 2. Nf3 Bg7 3. d3 {Upon review, the GK database says d4 would have been stronger.  I stay closed and move d3.  Looking back, I wonder why I didn't go ahead with the more aggressive move of Bb5.} c5 {A strong response.} 4. Nbd2 {I decide to go for a queenside attack.  It ultimately works.} d6 5. Rb1 Bg4 6. Be2 Bxf3 7. Nxf3 a6 8. c4 e6 9. b4 b6 10. bxc5 bxc5 11. Qa4+ {Here's what I expected at this point ... 11. ... Qd7 12. Bd1 Qxa4 13. Bxa4  Nd7 14. Bxd7  Kxd7 15. Rb7  Ke8 16. Ng5} Nd7 12. Qc6 {Since he didn't respond with a Queen block, it allows me to pressure the d6 pawn.} Ne7 {Black misses the attack.} 13. Qxd6 O-O 14. Rb7 Qa5+ {Now that I look back at this fresh, I see that a one-piece counter-attack is rarely effective.  In this case, it wasn't.  He's a move behind and can't gain quite regain the tempo.} 15. Bd2 Bc3 {Instead of protecting the knights, black adds a bishop into the mix.} 16. Rxd7 {I capitalize, gain 3, and I expect the following ... 16. ... Nc8 17. Qc6 Rb8 18. Rb7 } Bxd2+ {Once again, he surprises me and continues to attack, but from a weaker position.} 17. Nxd2 {My expectation again is that he'll preserve his knight... 17. ... Nc8 18. Qc6 Na7 19. Qc7 Qxa2 20. Qxc5 Nc8 21. Qc6 Na7 22. Qb7 Qa1  23. Bd1 } Qxa2 {He takes the pawn instead.} 18. Qxe7 {... and loses the second knight.} a5 19. Qxc5 {... and a pawn.} a4 20. Qb4 a3 21. O-O {Some defense is in order.} Rab8 22. Rb7 {Never trade when you're behind, unless you have a plan.  Black makes a nice series of moves and makes the game competitive again.  I probably should have just moved my queen out of the way while protecting the knight, i.e. Qc3.} Rxb7 23. Qxb7 Qxd2 24. Bf3 {24. ... Qxd3 25. Ra1 Qc3 26. Qb1 } Qxd3 25. Ra1 Qxc4 26. Qa7 Qc3 27. Qxa3 Rc8 28. Qxc3 Rxc3 29. Rd1 Kg7 {So I wind up up three, in spite of a mistake.  } 30. Be2 Rc2 31. Bb5 Rc5 32. Be8 Rc8 33. Bd7 Rd8 34. e5 Kf8 35. Rd6 Ke7 36. Ba4 Rxd6 37. exd6+ {I give up a pawn, but advance the game.  Conservative play is in order.  I starting looking for trades.} Kxd6 38. f3 g5 39. g4 Ke5 40. Kg2 Kf4 41. Be8 f6 42. h3 h6 43. Bg6 e5 44. Kf2 e4 {He had no good choices at this point.} 45. Bxe4 Ke5 46. Kg3 Kd6 47. h4 Ke5 48. hxg5 {Late game notes ... 48. ... hxg5 49. Bf5 Kd6 50. f4 gxf4  51. Kxf4 Ke7 52. Kg3 Kf7 53. Kh4 Kg7 54. Kh5 Kf7 55. Bg6  Ke6 56. Kh6 Ke7 57. Kg7 Ke6 58. Kf8 Ke5 } hxg5 49. Bf5 Kd4 50. Kf2 Ke5 51. Ke3 Kd6 52. Ke4 Ke7 53. Kd5 {More late game notes: 53. ... Kf7 54. Be6  Ke7 55. Bg8 Kf8 56. Bh7 Kf7 57.
