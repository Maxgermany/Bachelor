1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 {The first few moves were conventional, but after 4.Ba4, 4...b5 is the most common answer, and then it continues with 5.Bb3, Na5 followed by an exchange black takes on b3, and white takes back with the a pawn, as then, you're capturing towards the center.  But, there's nothing wrong with this move, as it's similar to the Berlin Defense.} 5. O-O {So, I treat it, as though, it were the Berlin Defense since castling is the most common reply there.} Be7 {She develops.  Although it's not an inaccuracy, preferable was 5...Nxe4, in which, white often responds with 6.Re1 and when the N retreats, white gets back a pawn.  Of course, similar to archduke_piccolo with this student, it was in the wrong sequence which should've lost a pawn.} 6. d4 {? Thinking about the exchange variation, starting with 6...Nxe4 but it's where I start to miscalculate.  However, this is a mistake as it should lose a pawn, as we're about to see.  Better was to centralize a Rook with 6.Re1 since what I'm thinking of has the Rook in that spot which is why it's part of the mainlines in the Berlin Defense.} exd4 7. Nxd4 d5 {This is Sue's first blunder, so the mentoring starts here.  Joe: ?? This is going to lose material, as we'll see. I know what then plan was which is exchanging pawns. But, I miscalculated when playing e4 because I got it mixed up with what the most common way, in which, the Ruy Lopez continues, so mainlines. So, better would've been take on e4 because after 4...dxe4, I'm down a pawn.  Sue: Our pawns are equal and you have the better position.  Joe: It's true that they are, but it's about what's to come. I say that because the N on f6, would've prevented that  The reason behind all of this is because your Nc6 was attacked twice and only defended once, Sue which is something to take note of, in the future. } 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Bxc6+ Kf8 {?? And, I give Sue Homework with the second blunder which she answered correctly.  Joe: Ok, there was another move that would've gotten you out of check. And, that was 10...Bd7 Why would that have been better?  Sue: I was thinking you would have taken my knight. of course if I had done that I could have cashed I am now going to loose my Rook which I didn't notice.  Joe: Yes, if you had played that, I would've gotten the Knight which is a piece.  But, by moving the monarch, it becomes a free Rook.} 11. Bxa8 Nb6 {Now, I'm familiar with the motivation behind this move (chess thought process) as that's how I used to think.  Sue is thinking, ok, Joe won a Rook but I will try to compensate by attacking it.  But, as I've also learned the hard way, there is no compensation for that.  I like her fighting spirit but the lesson is that in general, once you lose something it's gone.  With that being said, I exchange first because the liquidating while ahead.  Then, I will defend and when that happens, she'll be faced with multiple threats.} 12. Qxd8+ Bxd8 13. Bc6 {As now, her back rank is weakened.  It'll be difficult to defend this position without losing material.  I did get ideas from Ken in our training game, which I'll discuss as it blends in with our first lesson.  And, it's the same lesson that I forgot with Bernard when distracted and, consequently, was punished.  } Bf6 {She is developing, though.  My guess is that Sue intends to complete development.} 14. Re1 {But, this is where we really see the multiple threats.  This was played for two reasons.  First, the idea was centralizing one of the Rooks, since it's generally a good idea to do so.  More importantly, however, is the fact that I'm threatening mate in more then one way since my Bc6 and the Rook are now bad enough.  It's not going to be easy.  And, with the best move, the position is further comprised.} g6 {?? Which is noted here because I said, Better was 14...Be7, but white wins another piece after 15.Bg5 since mate is threatened. Best, however, was 14...Bd7, after which I'd liquidate 15.Bxd7, Nxd7 It's true that you don't want to liquidate when behind but it is better then mate. As now, mate is forced.} 15. Bh6+ Bg7 {That's because her only other option would've been 15...Kg8, but after that, I'd mate in the same move.  In other words, the next move would be the same which is also checkmate.} 16. Re8# {After this game, I messaged Sue.  And, this is where I remembered what Ken said to not only teach but use that lesson as the moral of this game.  So, I said, My advice, believe it or not, is the same as what Kenneth_fiore_3 gave me. And, I base it on that game combined with what happened in the first game which he pointed out. It's to look out for multiple, as opposed to, one threat. And, there's also to calculate through those variations. For example, you played ...g6, to prevent the immediate Re8#, but didn't see my DSB with the pieces around the monarch, I was able to organize them. So, playing through those lines and figuring out if there's more then one threat is a good way to become a better chess player.  The other thing that I got forgot to mention, Sue, is to compare your attackers and defenders to his or her attackers or defenders and take not of that.     }
