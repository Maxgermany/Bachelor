[Opening "Dutch defence (A81)"]

1. d4 {So I start conventionally} f5 {He plays the Dutch Defence.} 2. g3 {I play the main line.} Nf6 {Very conventional!} 3. Bg2 {The logical follow-up to my last.} g6 4. Nc3 {I threaten e4, but I found out later that this move actually scores very badly in practice.} Bg7 {He ignores my "threat", but d5, stopping it, scores better on the opening database.} 5. e4 {So I continue with the logical move.} fxe4 {He correctly takes, rather allow me to eventually get in e4-e5, see Charles Higgie (BCF158) vs. TimHilton (BCF141), where I gained a massive opening advantage, but eventually lost.} 6. Nxe4 {So I take back.} Nxe4 {He takes again} 7. Bxe4 {I take back} d5 {This scores badly on the databases, and I am not surprised - it leaves black with a backward e pawn on the semi-open e file (in other words, given time I can pile up my rooks against it. While in some openings, black can live with a backward pawn in a semi-open file (for instance e7-e5 systems in the open Sicilian), it is dubious here.} 8. Bg2 {So I drop back.} c6 {He re-enforces the d pawn. He can't immediately play e7-e5? as I can take on e5 followed by taking on d5. } 9. Nf3 {Now this is where we leave the opening databases. In both the games where this position can up, white has played Ne2. But my move seems to me more logical - preventing e7-e5 and leaving the e file open for my rooks. What do you think dear reader?} Bg4 {A logical move from his, if he wants to get in e7-e5.} 10. O-O {This move prevents e7-e5 as I can exchange on e5, followed by Rf1-e1, and win the Be5.} O-O {So he castles} 11. Re1 {and I prevent e7-e5 again. He started to play very slowly now, perhaps a sign he was concerned with his position.} Nd7 {Logical development, threatening e5, relieving his position} 12. Bf4 {So I stop it again.} Rf7 {He protects Pe7 and prepares to play Qb6. Perhaps I should have play c2-c3 to reduce the power of the move. However I decided to grab the two bishops while I can.} 13. h3 {Hitting the bishop.} Bxf3 {He takes} 14. Bxf3 {I take back} Qb6 {He attacks pawns on d4 and b2.} 15. c3 {I save the more important one.} Qxb2 {He takes.} 16. Qd3 {I protect c3 and also threaten a2-a4 followed by Re1-b1 winning his queen.} Qa3 {So he prevents that, and also protects pe7 in some variations.} 17. Bg4 {As well as threatening the knight, I also threaten Be6, so his reply is forced.} Nf8 {and I have compensation for the pawn, with the two bishops, more active pieces, and his pe7 still weak. But he does have the extra pawn. I'd say the position is finely balanced.} 18. Re2 {So I protect pa2 and free my Ra1, maybe to go to b1 and/or e1} c5 {He threatens c5xd4. There is a danger here of Bg7 coming to life, so I put a stop to that.} 19. Be5 {Securing the black squares in the centre.} Bxe5 {He takes} 20. Rxe5 {Of course, taking back with the pawn relieves all the pressure on e7} Qb2 {He attacks Ra1 and pf7} 21. Rf1 {So defensive measures are called for.} cxd4 {He takes} 22. Qxd4 {I take back} Qxa2 {He takes.} 23. Rxd5 {I take - of course with the rook - I don't want to exchange queens a pawn down.} e6 {He at last move the pawn} 24. Re5 {I pile up on e6} Rd7 {He attacks my queen, but maybe he overlooked the forthcoming little combination, which wins my pawn back. Now Bxe6 looks good, but is refuted by Qxe6! winning. However I can play a similar idea. What did I play?} 25. Qxd7 {Of course. I lose my queen, but I can win it back.} Nxd7 {He takes} 26. Bxe6+ {I now take on e6. Of course, he has to avoid Qxe6? Rxe6 and he is the exchange down.} Kg7 {He correctly moves his king.} 27. Bxa2 {I get the queen back} Nxe5 {And so we reach a position with level material again.} 28. Bd5 {Of course I can't play Rf1-e1?? losing to Nf3+ winning. So I protect f3 first.} Rb8 {He defends b7} 29. Re1 {I attack the knight} Kf6 {He protects} 30. f4 {I hit the knight} Nc6 {He retreats the knight. He said afterwards that he moved this very quickly - it was the last move before the time control. He thought that Nd3 was stronger. I am not convinced though} 31. Re6+ {I throw in a check. Now I think he should give up a pawn here with Kg7. After I play Nxc6 followed by Rxc6 or Re7 followed by Rxa7, he has Rb2, and I would have thought he may well be able to draw a pawn down. But he played...} Kf5 {I think he is losing now} 32. Kf2 {Threatening Kf3 followed by g3-g4 mate!} Rd8 {He hits my bishop} 33. Bc4 {I retreat. Of course he can't hit it again with Na5? which loses to Re5+ winning the knight.} g5 {So he tries to prevent the mate} 34. Kf3 {I threaten mate!} gxf4 {He takes} 35. gxf4 {I take back. OK find the best move for him?} a5 {This certainly isn't it! I think he has to play 35....Rd3+ 36. Bxd3 Kxe6 37. Bxh2 and he may still have drawing chances, a pawn down.} 36. Rh6 {Threat Be6 mate. He now picked up his rook, realised that he was in serious trouble, and eventually moved it. The only way to fight on is Ne5+ but he is surely lost, a piece down.} Re8 {So he prevents the mate in one. Find my move now!} 37. Bd3+ {Of course, the bishop can now check on this diagonal. He resigned here. I hope you like the annotation, please rate it, and leave a comment or two....}
