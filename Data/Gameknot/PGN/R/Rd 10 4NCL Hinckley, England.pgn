1. d4 {So I start with my usual} Nf6 {He knew that I would play the SÃ¤misch Variation, and prepared a line which Kasparov had played. I am not convinced that it is that good!} 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 g6 4. e4 Bg7 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 {This is a main line of the King's Indian Defence. For my comments on these moves, see this annotation of mine http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/penyfordd-v-rhyl-chester-district-league?gm=35684 or also see this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence,_S%C3%A4misch_Variation} e5 {Black strikes at the white centre.} 7. d5 {White closes the position} c6 {Black attacks white's centre} 8. Bd3 {White develops} cxd5 {Black exchanges. I regard this as a mistake as it relieves pressure on the white centre. If white were ever to play 0-0-0 it would be hard for black to open up files against the white king.} 9. cxd5 {So I take back.} a6 {I'm not sure this is best, why not Nh5 and f5 immediately?} 10. Nge2 {So I develop} Nh5 {The usual knight move} 11. Qd2 {I develop my queen} Nd7 {He develops his knight} 12. O-O-O {After a long thought, I decide to castle queenside, which is what I often do in this sort of position. My thinking is this - if I castle kingside he has a ready-made attack with f5-f4, g5-g4-g3 etc. If he tries to attack my king on the queenside, he is going to find it hard to open uip the a or the b file. There are two plans I can follow - either move my king to b1, and try and take over the c file, or to launch an attack on the kingisde. However afterwards I found that castling kingside is more common in this position. What do you think dear reader, which side would you castle on?} b5 {So his "attack" starts} 13. Kb1 {I tuck my king away. I am not afraid of 13...b4 14 Na4 as he can't then make much progress on the queenside.} Qa5 {Threatening b4 now. I was surprised that this position is in the Gameknot opening database. There are two games. Both times white played a3 here. But I thought a3 would just help black open up lines on the queenside. I decided to give my knight the d1 square and played...} 14. Rdc1 {Also with a view to taking over the c file sometime.} Bb7 {So he develops. I considered Nxb5 here, but it is refuted by Qxd2 16. Bxd2 axb5 17. Rc7 Nc5, attacking Bd3, so I played} 15. g4 {Going for the king side attack} Nf4 {A thematic pawn sacrifice. Otherwise he just gets hammered on the kingside.} 16. Nxf4 {So I take} exf4 {He takes back} 17. Bxf4 {I take the pawn.} Ne5 {He hits d3 and f3} 18. Be2 {So this is more-or-less forced} Rfe8 {Again, I looked hard at Nxb5 here. Maybe going into an ending where I have 3 pawns for a knight was a good idea? My passed a and b pawns look good. Any views dear reader.} 19. h4 {Instead I continued with king side operations.} Rac8 {And again I considered Nxb5 - now that his Ra8 has moved to c8 of course he can't meet it with a x b5 like he could before. What do you think dear reader?} 20. h5 {Instead I continue my king side attack} b4 {He hits my knight} 21. Nd1 {I retreat} Rxc1+ {He takes. He explained afterwards he was wanting to take my queen away from protecting my bishop on e2. Of course I can't recapture with my king as my pawn on a2 is hanging} 22. Qxc1 {So I take with the queen} Nxg4 {and this is his combination. It isn't really sound, but I fail to find the best defence.} 23. fxg4 {I take, although taking on g6 or d6 are also options.} Rxe4 {He takes, hitting my bishop} 24. Bf3 {I hit the rook.} Bxd5 {What is this? A further sacrifice?} 25. Bxe4 {I was thinking that he was planning  Bxe4+ 26. Ka1 Bxh1 when 27. Qc8+ Bf8 28. Bh6 mates him. I completely overlooked that he was also attacking a2. Afterwards I was thinking that instead of taking the rook, I could have played 25. Qc8+ Bf8 26. Bh6 immediately. However that fails to him playing Qxa2+ followed by Rc4+ winning my queen. But I did miss a win here. I should have played 25. b3 and white is clearly winning. } Qxa2+ {So he takes} 26. Kc2 {Forced} Bxe4+ {Now he takes} 27. Kd2 {Forced again} Qd5+ {and I am clearly losing} 28. Ke2 {Not 28. Ke3 Qd3+ 29. Kf2 Qf3+ and he picks up the rook with check. } Bxh1 {Now he takes. Now 29. Qc8+ Bf8 30. Bh6 fails to Qe6+ exchanging queens and I am just 3 pawns down in the ending. } 29. Nf2 {Threatening his bishop. I am 3 pawns down without compensation, but you never know....} Bf3+ {He checks} 30. Kf1 {I try to find a safe place for my king.} Qb5+ {He checks} 31. Kg1 {I run. My king has now travelled from b1 to g1} Qc5 {He offers the queen exchange. I was expecting Qe2 and if I check on c8 followed by Bh6 he has Qe1 mating.} 32. Qe1 {I refuse} Bc6 {He prepares to put his queen on the long diagonal and blast my king into the open again.} 33. Qe7 {I thought, "what the heck, may as well play aggressively"} Qd5 {So he threatens mate} 34. Qd8+ {I throw in a check} Bf8 {forced} 35. Kf1 {I see to the mate threat} Qc4+ {and he forks king and bishop. Time to resign. So I've lost to both juniors I have played this season (see http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/chester7vpenyffordd2wirral-league?gm=49458) Many thanks for reading this. Please leave a comment or two, and rate it on the star system. Until next time dear reader!}
