[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence, Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 {The Old Steinitz Defence; the Modern Steinitz Defence interposes 3...a6 4.Ba4 before playing this.} 4. d4 {Apparently the best move, according to my reading!} Bd7 {Stopping the pin, a problem is I play e5 witht he Knight still pinned!} 5. Nc3 exd4 {Black decides to open up the position right away!} 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 {And again, the usual line being 6...g6 to allow the Bishop out.} 7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 8. Qxd4 {Black wants to exchange quickly because he knows I am not good at endgames.} c5 {A little suspect, I would have thought, but it does drive away my Queen and lay claim to the d4 square.} 9. Qd3 Nf6 {Now Black gets on with his development.} 10. O-O Be7 11. Rd1 {Tempting to bring my Bishop out straight away, but I decide to develop it on b2 instead, and lay claim to the half-open file.} O-O 12. b3 a6 {Stops my Knight going to b5, but I was never going there anyway.} 13. Bb2 Qg4 {Surely way too early for a Queen sortie? Still, after the exchanges and with both sides castled, the early advantage White enjoys seems to have gone!} 14. h3 Qh4 {Black decides to keep his Queen in an attacking position, but he doesn't really have much.} 15. Nd5 {Inviting another exchange.} Nxd5 {As expected, Black is happy to hurry me on to the end game.} 16. Qxd5 {However, he allows me to post my Queen centrally, attacking the b-pawn, and have that nice long diagonal for my Bishop.} b6 {The b-pawn steps forward out of the line of fire.} 17. c4 {Forming a nice pawn chain, but rather open to attack now the b-pawn has advanced.} Rfd8 {Black wants to put his Bishop on the long diagonal, but needs to protect the d-pawn, the Queen still being rather out of position.} 18. Rd3 {It gives me time to allow my Rook to head for g3 and a K-side attack looming.} Bf6 {Black challenges my control of the diagonal.} 19. Rb1 {I don't want to capture myself, as that would bring the Queen back into play. Still, I'm having to concede the diagonal.} b5 {Curiously, Black passes up the chance to exchange.} 20. Rf3 {Now he can't, or he would lose a pawn; I'd play 21.Qxf7+ before recapturing.} Ra7 {Now that threat has been stopped, Black can exchange more safely.} 21. Bxf6 {Except so can I, and messing up Black's K-side pawns into the bargain...} gxf6 22. Rg3+ Kf8 {I expected the King to go into the corner, which would allow the Black Rook access to the g-file. As it is, I can now harrass the out of position Queen.} 23. Rg4 Qh6 {The only square!} 24. Rd1 {Getting ready to bring the other Rook to g3. I feel Black is in trouble.} bxc4 25. Qxc4 {I don't want to split my pawns up, and this allows me to reposition my Queen, putting a Rook on d5 instead.} Qh5 {Rather a pointless waste of a tempo...} 26. Rd5 {Since it lest me get my Rook where it wants to be, and drives the Queen back} Qh6 27. Qd3 Ke7 {The Black King is forced into the open to help with the defence of the d-pawn, the Queen still being out of position.} 28. Qg3 {Just in case Black has ideas of Rg8} Raa8 29. Rh4 {Perhaps a rather pointless chasing of the Queen, which now has escape via c1 anyway. The Black Rook can't leave the defence of the d-pawn, so maybe keeping my own Rook on the g-file was a better idea.} Qc1+ {My dithering has allowed the Queen to penetrate. I've allowed this because the pawn on h7 is now hanging, but I've missed something...} 30. Kh2 Qc2 {I can't take it because I lose the e-pawn, and the a-pawn is attacked too.} 31. a4 Rab8 {Suddenly, Black is fighting back, all due to my allowing the Black Queen back into the game.} 32. Rd3 {I'm forced onto the defence.} c4 {The pressure builds up on the b-pawn.} 33. Rc3 {Now I think I've eased my position, but Black is in a chance-taking mood...} cxb3 {Wicked little move, and I don't know whether it's an error or not, having no analysis. It certainly threw up some possibilities for both sides. taking the Queen and allowing 34...bxc2 seemed risky indeed, with the Rook on b8 ready to come down and support the pawn.} 34. e5 {I thought Black might play 34...b2, allowing me to capture the d or f-pawn with check, and hopefully a strong attack...} dxe5 {Presumably because 34...fxe5 allows a check on g5, Black takes with the other pawn. But this allows me to win material...} 35. Rxc2 bxc2 36. Qa3+ {Now I can cover the Queening square...} Ke8 37. Rxh7 {Win the hanging h-pawn and threaten to force an exchange of Rooks!} Rdc8 {Black covers the pawn, but it's a little late...} 38. Rh8+ Kd7 39. Qd3+ Ke7 {I'd rather hoped Black might go to e6, after which 40.Rxc8 Rxc8 41.Qxa6 wins. Never mind - I'm still happy...} 40. Rxc8 Rxc8 41. Qa3+ {Bakc to covering the Queening square.} Ke8 42. Qc1 Kf8 {Black heads towards the K-side and a little cover, and we're in an endgame, so of course I start to go wrong. It seems clear now that the best plan is to advance my King up the K-side with the passed h-pawn; Black can't bring his Rook across or his own pawn witll fall...} 43. Kg1 {Instead I get the idea I can give up my Queen for the Rook and pawn and win the resulting position. This might work, excpe tBlack has moves too...} Kg7 44. Kf1 Kg6 45. Ke2 f5 46. h4 {Foolishly hoping I can play 47.Qg5+ next, which would win the Rook after 47...Kh7 48.Qxf5+} f6 {Like I say, Black gets moves too...} 47. Kd2 {I carry on with my plan, which seems the height of foolishness now.} f4 48. Qxc2+ Rxc2+ 49. Kxc2 {Now to deal with those advancing pawns. Except in advancing the h-pawn in the hope of an error I've given Black a chance - } Kh5 50. g3 fxg3 51. fxg3 {Suddenly it doesn't seem so easy; there's a passed pawn to deal with. heading up the board to capture the pawn on a6 is not going to be an option; I'm forced to use my King in defence...} e4 52. Kd2 f5 53. Ke3 Kg4 {Keeping me out of the crucial f4 square.} 54. Kf2 {I'm forced back to defend the g-pawn. Allowing its capture and playing h5 seems too risky.} a5 {Clever use of a spare move!} 55. Kg2 {I still don't want to risk allowing the g-pawn to fall.} Kh5 {I thought Black might try 55...e3 here, but he backs off instead.} 56. Kh3 Kg6 57. g4 {Foolishly I thought that once the pawns had been exchanged I had a won endgame...} f4 {Of course Black doesn't exchange!} 58. h5+ Kg5 59. Kg2 {Now I'm happy for Black to take the g-pawn, and my h-pawn is away!} e3 {He advances his own pawn first. Now I can't allow the pawn to fall.} 60. Kf3 Kh6 {Nor can I capture the f-pawn...} 61. Ke2 {We dance back and forth...} Kg5 62. Kf3 Kh6 63. Ke2 Kg5 {And it's a draw. Clearly I went terribly wrong in a position where I had a Queen for a Rook, though even after the exchange I suspect I missed winning chances! Pawn endgames are a bugger.}
