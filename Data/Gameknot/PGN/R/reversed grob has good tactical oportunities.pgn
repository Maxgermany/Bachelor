1. e4 g5 2. d4 Bg7 {quick grob, g5 pawn sacrifice targeting b2 and a1 rook this trap is to much easy for good player, i have no chance, but it's fun anyway ! ):} 3. Bd3 c5 {attack d4} 4. d5 {gambit refused, in this situation, i cannot attack the d5 support by f7 f5, discovering the king side, so i just strengthen c5 which has a good central position  } d6 5. c4 {white consolidate d5 and open the queen diagonal d1 a4 it's time for black to close on the king side protecting g5} h6 6. Qc2 {i did not understand wy this...somebody help. } Na6 {Nb4 attack queen and maybe axchange whith d3 bishop} 7. a3 {cancel the knight attack} Nf6 {develop and prepare to go Nh5 ...Nf4 to attack g2 and d3 bishop (and dont know exactly what matter whith this bishop !...)} 8. Nc3 Nh5 9. h4 {this is good to develop my plans, because when i'll move my knight to f4, it will be also a good response to this pawn exchange, be cause then  if h4xg5 h6xg5 and the white rook is weak so it has to exchange the rooks and the white king side will be weak, this is in my advantage} Nf4 10. Bxf4 gxf4 {so now the pawn a4 has loose his reason to be there and i won a good central position whith my pawn in f4 that y have to renforce} 11. Nf3 e5 12. dxe6 e.p. {this is not a problem, because f7xe6 ...e6 e5 and i win the same result whith a strong pawn central occupation} fxe6 13. O-O-O e5 {here we are. the white game is quite disorganized but i still miss opportunities to plan } 14. Nd5 {i dont like this advanced knight, i have to exchange it } Nc7 15. Qe2 {white anticipate the knight exchange and prepare Bd3 b5+ ! also can make chess whith the queen inh5 after moving the knight the game is becoming dangerous for blacks ...but i have some good move to play whith my c8 bishop ...} Nxd5 {i have to exchange this knight anyway !} 16. cxd5 Bg4 {Bg4 ! here it is the attack by king side is dead and double treathen : queen and d1 rook the d3 bishop attack is not so dangerous} 17. Bb5+ Ke7 {you see, king can move !} 18. Qd3 {white cancel the bishop threat} h5 {i renforce this position, in case of exchange (Nh2 ...Nxg4) black wil take back whith the h5 pawn and the win a very good advanced pawn...} 19. Rde1 {cancel the bishop treathen but loose a tempo} Bh6 {just in case of the white knight move ...} 20. Kb1 {cancel treathen and loose tempo,  during this time i develop} Qa5 {now i have a very good tactical advantage the queen will be very boring to move from there and i can bring my second rook to this side...} 21. Bc4 {anticipate a7 a6} b5 {b7 b5! i like this move, sure i will loose this pawn, but this is the goal ! and then i will have the be colon free to treath the king whith the a8 rook} 22. Bxb5 Rab8 {you see ?!} 23. Bc6 {i whould play this, because it has no interest to put the bishop in c6 at this moment, the dnager is in b2, the bishop is out of action} Qb6 {preparing mat in b2} 24. Re2 {defending b2} Rhg8 {preparing Bc8 (treath Rxg2 and/or Ba6 threathening white queen)} 25. Rc2 Bc8 26. Rg1 Ba6 {black queeping the initiative } 27. Qc3 Bb7 {exchange bishops} 28.
