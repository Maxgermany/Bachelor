1. a4 a5 {symmetrical} 2. b4 {provocative} b5 {symmetrical} 3. c4 {provocative} c5 {symmetrical} 4. d4 {provocative} d5 {symmetrical} 5. e4 {provocative} e5 {symmetrical} 6. f4 {provocative} f5 {symmetrical} 7. g4 {provocative} g5 {symmetrical} 8. h4 {provocative} h5 {symmetrical} 9. cxd5 {bringing a flank pawn toward the center while also preparing Bxb5+} exd4 10. Bxb5+ {Takes pawn with check} Bd7 11. Bxd7+ {usually not a good idea to initiate a capture} Qxd7 12. b5 {Now Black has initiative} fxe4 {Black has equal material and a better pawn center.} 13. Nd2 {trying desperately aim at him center} Qxd5 {takes a pawn now I am down a pawn} 14. Qb3 {queen trade?} Qxb3 {yes} 15. Nxb3 hxg4 {takes second pawn and reveals rook to h4} 16. fxg5 {I have 3 passed pawns. Black has 4 passed pawns.} Nd7 17. Ba3 {Trying to attack pawn center sort of like a Nimzo-Indian} Be7 {attacking g5} 18. g6 {get out of way but now attacking h5} Ngf6 {why not take the pawn} 19. Rc1 {bringing 3rd attacker to Nimzoesque c5-pawn} d3 {there is no fork on d2 yet} 20. Nxc5 {I take the pawn} Nxc5 21. Bxc5 Rc8 {There is no skewer, because my bishop can retreat while defending rook, which would not be possible with the rook and bishop on opposite-coloured squares.} 22. Be3 {retreatitive defense} Bb4+ {check} 23. Kd1 {stay in front of passed pawns} Rxc1+ {exchange} 24. Bxc1 {take with bishop to be safer, do not leave the bishop out in the rain} Nh5 {dangerous} 25. g7 {this pawn is bye bye} Nxg7 26. Bg5 {I can save h-pawn} Kf7 {Black is completely winning} 27. Rh2 {deveoping laterally, since the knight is dominated by pawns,} Bc5 {attacking knight} 28. Rg2 {defending knight} Bxg1 {? the knight was dominated so why give up perfectly healthy piece for it?} 29. Rxg1 {now I have a chance, because of that "minor" blunder} Ne6 {attack} 30. Rf1+ {aggressive, the Rook and Bishop are superior to the Rook and Knight, because they coordinate better, have more tactical possibilities. You have to be a grandmaster to draw Rook Bishop vs. Rook, but not to draw Rook Knight vs. Rook.} Ke8 31. Re1 {x-ray to knight and king} Nxg5 {exchanges to a rook pawn endgame} 32. hxg5 {but cannot defend the e-pawn} g3 33. Rxe4+ {Black's pawns fall down to my feet while I have the upper hand} Kd7 {moves} 34. Rg4 {get rid of the more dangerous pawn first that my king can't take care of} Ke7 {moves} 35. g6 {Black resigned in an equal material Rook Pawn Endgame, because I will win the d & g-pawns.}
