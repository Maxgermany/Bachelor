[Opening "Latvian counter-gambit (C40)"]

1. e4 {Hi all, I've got a very fun game between chicoboy and I to show off from early this month. This is the closest he's come to beating me yet, and let me tell you, it was close indeed!} e5 2. Nf3 f5 {I've been playing the Latvian Gambit exclusively in these games. Gerhard has been getting much better at thwarting it. I'm not going to give the opening itself a lot of detail; I have a whole series of annotations on it if you want that.} 3. d3 {I do still think this is too passive, though (better 3.Nxe5 or 3.d4!)} Nc6 {Getting the Knight out and defending e5.} 4. Be3 {This isn't necessarily the best place for this Bishop, since it could be easy to chase with f5-f4.} Nf6 5. exf5 d5 6. d4 {This is essentially why I think 3.d3 is not ideal for White--his best chances lie in an all-out total war against the Black kingdom. Kudos to White for recognizing that and making the second pawn move.} Bb4+ 7. c3 Bd6 8. Bb5 {White repels the invading forces with ease and continues his development.} Bd7 {?? Tactical opportunities abound in this opening, and I missed the one that this allows. 8...e4 was far better.} 9. Bxc6 {My opponent does not miss the tactical opportunity.} Bxc6 10. dxe5 {Winning a piece.} Be7 {Trying to keep the Bishop pair, but probably 10...O-O was better, gaining a little in terms of time.} 11. exf6 {Black should be pretty much lost at this point, but I'm going to make White prove it. It's still very early in the game--plenty of time for tactics and mistakes!} Bxf6 12. O-O {White gets his King to safety.} Qd7 13. Nd4 Bxd4 {Black trades, since his light-squared Bishop is better-placed than his dark-squared one--though neither is looking great at the moment.} 14. Bxd4 O-O 15. Nd2 Qxf5 16. Bc5 {Probably not what I would have played, since it just forces Black into the Rook lift he wants to play anyway. As White is a full piece ahead, I probably would have simply focused on finishing development and then trading down into a won endgame.} Rf6 17. Nf3 b6 {Trying to drive this Bishop off the a3-f8 diagonal in preparation for ...Raf8.} 18. Bd4 Rh6 19. Be3 Rg6 {!? This looks like it fails to a tactic, but it's actually a stronger threat that I will explain in a moment...} 20. Nh4 {Forking the Q and R, but it's really important to notice: **this is a bluff!!** White cannot actually take the Queen, for if he does, Black gets back in the game with a nasty windmill attack: 20.Nh4 d4!! 21.Nxf5?? Rxg2+ 22.Kh1 Rxf2+! 23.Kg1 Rg2+ 24.Kh1 Rg3+ 25.Rf3 Bxf3+ 26.Qxf3 Rxf3 and Black has a fine position, though he's still a little behind.} Qf6 {?????? Black set up the windmill combination perfectly, but entirely failed to execute it! I really don't know what came over me. As I mentioned above, correct here was 20...d4!} 21. Nxg6 Qxg6 22. Qd4 {The situation looks very grim for Black, a full Rook in the hole. He needs to activate his pieces and play energetically--or else resign, but Black committed to Total War with his second move, so he's not going to back down now!} Bb7 23. f3 {Blocking the Bishop's diagonal.} Rf8 24. f4 {?! I don't like this at all. This pawn was well-placed on f3; now it just looks vulnerable. White would probably be having more luck with a queenside attack here.} c5 {Black forces the Queen out of the way, to allow ...d5-d4, opening the line for the Bishop once again and threatening immediate mate on g2.} 25. Qe5 {? Better was 25.Qd2, where the Queen defends g2 against the imminent mate threat.} d4 {Winning back a little material at the very least!} 26. g3 {? Letting the enemy Bishop see straight through your castle is never wise. 26.Qg5 was called for. Now Black can actually gain huge advantage with 26...Qc6! threatening mate once more and forcing the White pieces to scramble to save the King.} dxe3 {? This seems obvious, but 26...Qc6 was better. As long as Black is threatening mate on g2, he could take the Bishop any time!} 27. Qxe3 {Better was the more combative 27.f5! promising a forced Queen exchange (because of 28.Qe6) and a won game for White as a result.} Re8 28. Qf2 Qh5 {? For some reason I just wasn't paying enough attention to the long diagonal this game. 28...Qc6 or 28...Qe4 were *still* better, threatening mate now on h1. The text... basically doesn't do anything.} 29. Rae1 Rd8 30. Re2 Ba6 {? Not as strong as it seems, because White can simply play...} 31. Re5 {Of course.} Qf7 32. Rfe1 Qxa2 {?? Oh God no. 32...Qxa2?? 33.Re8+ Rxe8 34.Rxe8+ Kf7 35.Qe1 is now virtually unstoppable.} 33. Re5e8+ Rxe8 34. Rxe8+ Kf7 35. Re5 {Not super strong, but White obviously still has a huge lead. It would have been better to get the QW into play.} Qb1+ 36. Re1 Qd3 37. h4 {?! This doesn't seem to have a clear purpose. White needs to activate his pieces, not push pawns.} Bb7 38. Qe2 {? Simply gives up the g-pawn--and the all-important initiative.} Qxg3+ 39. Kf1 Qxf4+ {Probably 39...Qh3+ 40.Kf2 Qxh4+ was better, leaving the f-pawn in play to prevent nasty counterattacks down the f-file against the Black King. Now White can force the Queens off the board with 40.Qf2, leaving the game pretty much drawn as White probably doesn't have any way to break the Black defenses with a Rook for a Bishop+two pawns.} 40. Kg1 Qg3+ 41. Kf1 Qf3+ {Again, 41...Qh3+ followed by ...Qxh4+ would have been better. Black actually stands a chance of winning in that line due to his passed pawns, but frankly I was relieved that I'd managed a draw and essentially played this move as a tacit draw offer (as after the exchange of Queens, the're no good way for anyone to progress).} 42. Kg1 Qxe2 {Forcing the drawn position anyway.} 43. Rxe2 Bd5 44. Rf2+ {Now we can maneuver all we want; nothing can be accomplished by force anymore.} Ke7 45. Kh2 a5 46. Rf5 Kd6 47. Kg3 b5 {Initiating an "attack", but White can stop it without much trouble, e.g. 48.Rf8.} 48. Kg4 {?? Noooooooo. With this misstep, the game is suddenly lost for White. Black has majorities on both wings, and with no pieces left on the board, he will promote eventually.} Be6 {Pinning the Rook and winning the exchange.} 49. Kg5 Bxf5 50. Kxf5 Kd5 {All Black must do is keep enough pawns alive to queen one, without letting the White h-pawn through. On d5, the BK protects e6, and as long as neither of Black's other kingside pawns move, White has no way to get through.} 51. Kg5 b4 52. cxb4 axb4 53. Kf4 Kd4 {Not letting the WK get in front of the queenside pawns.} 54. h5 c4 {0-1. It's over, and White resigns after a great, hard-fought game against a player rated 500 points above him. Thanks for reading; comments are appreciated!}
