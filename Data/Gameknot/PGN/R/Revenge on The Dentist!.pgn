1. e4 {Hi everyone, this is the game immediately after my ignominious defeat against The Dentist called "The Dentist has his Day".  Well, The Dentist was threatening another kingside pawn storm and I had to act fast.  I did gamble a bit and played a move that could be easily rebuffed by a player at my level, but 300 points south of me, well that could be another matter ........} Nc6 {1. ....................... Nc6 - Nimsowich's Opening, an unusual but sound opening and the knight move hits out at d4 and b4.} 2. Nf3 f6 {2. ................. f6 - not sure about this move, bolsters e5 but opens up The Fool's Mate diagonal.} 3. d4 d5 {3. ................... d5 - challenges my centre - a pair of pawns are now exchanged.} 4. exd5 Qxd5 5. Nc3 Qe6+ {5. ................. Qe6 - this move takes us out of the database, my previous move attacked the Wicked Witch of the West so she had to move somewhere.  I do not feel this check is very good.  I block the check with Be2 and black plays his queen to f7, evading a pawn fork on d5.} 6. Be2 Qf7 7. O-O h5 {7. .................. h5 - Help - here comes the threatened pawn storm, what shall I do here?  Wait for the executioner.  I now hit out at c7.} 8. Nb5 e6 9. Bf4 {9. Bf4 - attacking the c pawn for a second time.} Bd6 {9. ................. Bd6?? - a natural developing move, but it allows a devastating tactical shot on d6.} 10. Bxd6 cxd6 11. Nxd6+ {11. Nxd6  - here it is, a knight fork - after this I will be a Q P up for a mere knight.  The Dentist then stated in the chat that he knew he was a long way behind in material but would play on for a few more moves and pray for a miracle!} Ke7 12. Nxf7 Kxf7 13. Re1 {13. Re1 - immediately homing in on the e file - can I get a quick checkmate here?} g5 {13. ................ g5 - continues his pawn storm but without the Wicked Witch of the West I don't think it will materialise.} 14. Bc4 {14. Bc4 - piles up on the e6 pawn which is pinned to the black king and opens up the e file.  The dentist defends it with Nd8.} Nd8 15. d5 {14. d5 - trying to cut down black's army by forcing exchanges but black's e pawn moves up and allows a discovered check when I push my pawn up to d6.} e5 16. d6+ Ke8 17. Nxe5 {17. Nxe5 - I decide to sacrifice my knight for two pawns to open up the e file and get at the black king.  The Dentist went on holiday but did not set up his vacation flag.  He therefore timed out.  I think, though, that white has a winning advantage in this position.  Do you, the jury agree?  Joanne}
