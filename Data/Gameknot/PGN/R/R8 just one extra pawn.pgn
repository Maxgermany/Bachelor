[Opening "Centre game (C22)"]

1. e4 e5 2. d4 {I was expecting to go into a Petroff (like in round 4), as that was my main opening at that time, but my opponent decided to deviate from the usual 2.Nf3.} exd4 {The only reasonable move in this position, in my opinion.} 3. Qxd4 {?! Apparently White played 2.d4 without knowing the theory, or he just accepted an inferior position for some surprise value to his opening. Either way, 3.c3, the Danish Gambit, is better.} Nc6 {This way, Black gains a tempo on the queen and forces it to move again, either blocking one of White's bishops, retreating to an awkward square (a4) or undeveloping.} 4. Qd1 {White chose the latter, although I like 4.Qe3 better as it at least keeps White somewhat active and also prevents 4...Bc5, as also indicated by the opening theory (as far as there is any on this position).} Nf6 5. Bg5 {Preventing me from taking on e4 immediately, but I guess a simple 5.Nc3 was better because this gives me some tactical possibilities.} Be7 {As mentioned earlier, 4.Qe3 prevents ...Bc5, so probably I should have played that here. It would also threaten ...Bxf2+! and if Kxf2 then ...Nxe4+ wins back the piece with a huge advantage for Black. This was also suggested by a club mate (rated 1700) with whom I analysed this game afterwards (I'll call him G). However, my move also threatens something...} 6. Nc3 {?! ... Which White misses. 6.f3 was the only way to retain material equality, although it's an awkward move to make.} Nxe4 {! This combination wins a pawn for Black.} 7. Bxe7 {Or 7.Nxe4 Bxg5.} Qxe7 8. Nxe4 Qxe4+ 9. Ne2 {? this move is just bad. 9.Be2? fails to 9...Qxg2, but 9.Qe2 is better. Maybe White was reluctant to play that because the queen exchange would favour me, being the side with a material plus (although the rest of the game shows that he was probably not aware of that rule).} d5 {? Here I should have played 9...Nb4!, as also suggested by G. Because 10.Rc1 fails to 10...Nxa2 11.Ra1 Nb4 and we have the same situation minus a White pawn on a2, the only way to defend c2 is 10.Kd2, depriving White of castling rights and giving me other tactical possibilities due to my better development and White's awkward king placement. My move is more positionally oriented, but not bad either.} 10. c3 {?! Understandable to defend d4 and b4, but this is just asking for another knight manoeuvre...} O-O {... But again I choose the more slow and positional way. However, 10...Ne5 was very strong. The computer comes up with this continuation: 11.Qd4 Nd3+ 12.Kd2 Qxd4 13.Nxd4 Nxf2 and this is obviously winning for Black, being two pawns ahead. Notice that White is forced to move his queen (or h1 rook but that piece doesn't have any decent squares), as otherwise 11...Nd3+ followed by 12...Nf2 forks king and rook. (There is actually one other line which avoids that, namely 11.f3 Nd3+ 12.Kd2 and now I have to retreat my queen (12...Qg6, say), but that's obviously not pleasant for White either.)} 11. Rc1 {? This makes ...Ne5 even stronger.} Re8 {? Apparently I was just not looking at those possibilities carefully enough. Again, a simple 11...Ne5 wins easily as now ...Nd3 already forks king and rook..} 12. Qc2 {?! Again, not the best. White is proposing a queen exchange while he is behind in material. He should really, really focus on developing his other forces Whiile defending d3.} Bf5 {?! I wanted to play 12...Qxc2 13.Rxc2 Bf5 which is clearly better as it wins a tempo on the White rook, but somehow I reversed the move order. I was just not fully concentrated in this phase of the game.} 13. Qxe4 Bxe4 14. f3 Bg6 {I had been looking at this line at move 12, but I had already seen that 14...Bd3?! would lose a pawn to 15.Rd1 Bc4 16.b3 (which G missed at first). That was the reason why I preferred 12...Qxc2 over 12...Bf5, and the reason why I had to play 14...Bg6 here.} 15. Kf2 Rad8 16. Nd4 {I don't like this, as it just isolates White's d-pawn (and there is nothing to gain from the open  c-file for White). Moreover, it proposes another exchange of pieces. I guess White was not aware of the fact that piece exchanges generally favour the side with extra material.} Nxd4 17. cxd4 Rd7 {17...c6 seems such an obvious move that I had almost played it instantaneously (and G had also expected me to play it), until I realised that there were other possibilities as well. This move has the dual purpose of defending c7 (and with that the seventh rank as well) and preparing to double up rooks.} 18. g4 {At first, G thought that White would win an exchange with 18.Bb5, but I simply respond with 18...c6. That the computer gives it as best in my view demonstrates White's lack of possibilities. The continuation given by the computer is (18.Bb5 c6) 19.Rhe1!?> Rxe1 20.Rxe1 Kf8 (I can't take 20...cxb5?? due to the back rank mate), but this is another piece exchange which I would have been glad to accept.} Rde7 19. Kg3 {Marching up on the kingside, maybe trying to trap my bishop on g6. Still White is unable to develop his remaining forces, as there's  no useful square for the bishop and the rook.} c6 {Necessary anyway, to defend the seventh rank before infiltrating with my rooks.} 20. Rd1 Re7e1 21. Rd2 Re8e3 {?! Looks nice, but it's not best. I was planning ...Bd3, but as I'll show later, it's still not possible after this.} 22. Kf2 f5 {22...Bd3?? (which was G's first thought as well) fails to 23.Bxd3! Rxh1 (or 23...Rxd3 24.Kxe1) 24.Kxe3. (Not 23.Rxd3?? Rxf1+! 24.Kxf1 Rxd3). The computer suggests 22...Re7, but I didn't want to admit that 21...R8e3 was a mistake yet.} 23. Bg2 {The only way for White to untangle is by exchanging more pieces.} Rxh1 24. Bxh1 Re7 25. h3 {A useless move.} fxg4 26. fxg4 {Why not 26.hxg4 (or what was the purpose of 25.h3 if you don't take with the h-pawn here)? This frees the bishop, but it will just be exchanged, which is, again, good for me.} Be4 {OK, but I actually played this too quickly.} 27. Re2 {I had actually overlooked this pin, but I have a resource to save myself.} Rf7+ {The check saves me and allows for yet another exchange.} 28. Kg1 Bxh1 29. Kxh1 Kf8 {G suggested 29...Rf1+ but after 30.Kg2 I don't see what I have achieved. I wanted to get my king involved. I also looked at 29...Rf3 30.Kg2 Rd3, but White would infiltrate on the seventh rank and it's not necessary to allow that. If I can just keep White's counterplay under control, my extra pawn will eventually be enough to win.} 30. Kg2 Re7 {Proposing an exchange...} 31. Rf2+ {... Refusing ...} Ke8 32. Kf3 {? ... But still allowing it. This is, in my view, the losing move of this game. The pawn ending is an easy win for Black, although it takes some time.} Rf7+ {He seemed surprised by this move, and after the game he told me that this was the moment at which he realised he was lost. Apparently he did know that pawn endings with a pawn less are generally lost. This one is no exception.} 33. Ke3 Rxf2 34. Kxf2 Ke7 {A nice suggestion by G was 34...g5, which immediately stalls all play on the kingside for White. This moves wins as well though.} 35. Kf3 Kd6 36. b4 {He is trying to stop ...c5, but he won't be able to stop it forever. F'ritz suggests 36.h4 c5 37.Ke3 b5, but that's an easy win for me as well.} b6 {Sticking to my plan of playing ...c5, but the computer prefers 36...Kc7, then 37...Kb6 and push the pawns on the queenside.} 37. Kf4 {37.Ke3 holds out longer, but White is dead lost anyway.} c5 38. bxc5+ {The computer prefers 38.h4, but I would first stall White's kingside play and then play ...cxb4, manoeuvre the king to White's a-pawn, take it and march up the b-pawn, a simple and effective plan.} bxc5 39. Ke3 {I don't understand Fritz' suggestion 39.dxc5 Kxc5, because after 40.Ke3 Kc4 my d-pawn cannot be stopped from promoting.} cxd4+ 40. Kxd4 h6 {Somewhat more accurate is 40...g6, when White's in zugzwang one move earlier than in the game.} 41. h4 {Just making some tempo moves before moving his king, but Black has enough moves to force White to give up the opposition first.} g6 42. h5 g5 43. a3 a6 44. a4 a5 {And White has to move his king, so he resigned. He actually thought that he would not be able to stop the d-pawn. He is able to: 45.Kd3 Kc5 46.Kc3 d4+ 47.Kd3 Kd5 48.Kd2 Kc4 49.Kc2 d3+ 50.Kd2 Kd4 51.Kd1 Ke3 52.Kc1 d2+ 53.Kd1, but then Black creates two passed pawns on the kingside after 53...Kf4, ...Kg4xh4xg5, which will decide the game. An instructive game to show how one pawn can make the difference. I think White actually played a good game considering his rating, but one early tactical mistake cost him.}
