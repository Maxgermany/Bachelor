1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Nc3 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 Ne7 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. a4 a6 10. Bxd7+ Qxd7 11. O-O Nf5 12. Qf4 Bc5 {the bishop turns out to be very useful on this diagonal} 13. Be3 Rc8 14. g4 Nxe3 15. fxe3 {white's e3 pawn is pinned.} d4 {exd would probably be pretty harmless for white} 16. Rad1 {black's d-pawn is pinned to the queen.  even though it was blitz, i was able to calculate the following intriguing sequence...} dxe3 17. Rxd7 e2+ 18. Kg2 exf1=Q+ 19. Kxf1 Kxd7 {white is down a pawn here} 20. Qxf7+ Be7 21. Kg2 {avoiding the check after qxg7} Rc4 {threatening rxg4 followed by rg5 or rh4} 22. Qxg7 Rf8 {with white's knight useless, black has all the initiative here.  white's queen will not be able to prosecute a mating attack on its own.} 23. Qxh7 Rxg4+ {if kh3 then rh4+ wins the queen leading to a rook versus knight endgame.  kh1 is mating after rf1#.  this was one of my better wins...} 24. Kh1 {}
