1. e4 {I started off as usual with kings pawn opening.} e5 {He replied mirror opening} 2. Bc4 {I follow up with my favorite c4...always looking to take on f-7 so the king can't castle to throw off my opponent.} Nf6 {He brings out his knight} 3. d3 {I get ready trade to move my bishop to g5 to take his knight to weaken his king.} Nc6 {Looks like he's setting up a simple king's indian defense.} 4. Bg5 {Again he doesn't know that I really want his knight in my pocket. I prepare to take.} Nd4 {He makes questionable move.} 5. c3 {I counter...and at the same time I prepare to move my queen to c2 for a second check on the king after the bishop checks him on f7.} Nc6 {He retreats} 6. Bxf7+ {Here is where I make my move and check his king to take him out of position and throw him off.} Kxf7 {He does the obvious.} 7. Qb3+ {Second check goes as planned.} Ke8 {He brings his king back home.} 8. Qb5 {This is where the noob comes out of me....There is no reason for this move. I was hoping to take the pawn on c5 at the same time checking his king but didn't see the defending knight...stupid I know!} Be7 {Looks like he's bringing out the bishop to protect his knight.} 9. Nf3 {I bring out my knight in hopes to castle soon and protect the bishop and for center control.} d6 {He does what is expected and pushes up one of his pawns to d6} 10. d4 {I push up my pawn for center control.} exd4 {He takes my pawn on d4} 11. cxd4 {I take back} Bd7 {More knight protection from black} 12. Bxf6 {Finally I take his knight! the move I have been waiting for. Maybe a bit too soon as I now see I could have moved my pawns up to protect the bishop?} Bxf6 {He retakes with bishop on f6} 13. e5 {Better late than never} Nxd4 {He steals my pawn at the same time threatning my queen } 14. Qd5 {b7 might have been a better move. What do you think?} Nc2+ {Another noob mistake. Forgetting to castle !!! and my king and rook being forked as I am checked.} 15. Ke2 {Should have moved closer to the knight but didn't want my king out in the open.} c6 {He goes for my queen} 16. Qb3 {I pretend to go for his knight but actually im staring down b7 which is the move i missed prior.} Nxa1 {He does the obvious and takes my rook.} 17. Qxb7 {I take his pawn on b7} dxe5 {He pushes up his pawn to e5} 18. Nc3 {I finally move my knight out because im low on pieces...I am actually down major at this point. How I win is beyond me.} Nc2 {He moves his knight to c2} 19. Rd1 {I get my rook to an open file as I'm sure you will all appreciate} Nd4+ {He checks me with his knight.} 20. Rxd4 {I trade with my rook.} exd4 {He takes my rook with his pawn.} 21. Nxd4 {and I take back his pawn} Rb8 {He goes for my queen with his rook.} 22. Qxa7 {I take his pawn on a7} Rxb2+ {He checks me again} 23. Kf1 {I move my king once more.} Rd2 {Black casually moves his rook to d2 as he eyes down my knight with both his rook and his bishop. I have to move one of my knights..Which one?} 24. Nf5 {I move one of my knights to f5. One of them has to be taken. I think I chose wisely.} Bxc3 {Looking at the board now...I am down -12 in material...and I only have 2 active pieces to his 5 active pieces...how did I do it? This is the good part !!!} 25. Qe3+ {I check him with my queen at the same time getting ready to take his bishop.} Kf8 {He moves his king.} 26. Qxc3 {I take his bishop and now his rook is looking nice.} Rd1+ {He checks me again.} 27. Ke2 {I move my king again.} Rd5 {I don't think this was a good move by black to retreat his rook and go for my knight. a better move would be to check my again with his queen by going black queen to e8. Instead he moves his rook to d5. } 28. Qxg7+ {You probably saw this coming. Its the move I was waiting on. I check his king at the same time his rook is threatened and I am protected by the knight on f5. At this point not much he can do but follow my lead.} Ke8 {he moves his king again} 29. Qxh8+ {I take his rook. Again checking him !} Kf7 {His queen is now vulnerable} 30. Qxd8 {now his queen is taken. and I am up in material. The tables have now turned that quickly. I think his best move here would be to check me or take my knight.} Be6 {He chose bishop to e7 to guard his rook.} 31. Qe7+ {Again I check him and threaten his bishop.} Kg6 {He is setting himself up now but he has no choice.} 32. Qxe6+ {At this point my opponent resigns as he will most likely be checkmated in on a couple moves. Thanks for viewing my game. hope you enjoyed it...again I am new to this game so please tell me how I did or what I could have done better. Thanks!! }
