1. e4 d5 {My usual.} 2. exd5 Nf6 3. g3 {! Interesting. A move I am not prepared to (finally!). Now the Icelandic is not possible anymore: if e6, dxe6, Bxe6 would be a fatal mistake due to Bxb7. Here, the wisest move is clearly Nxd5, and then to stand some unconfortable position of the N. This was not the game I'd want to go in. } e5 {The idea is (dxe6ep) fxe6 and I would have had a strange position with a e4 to threat, after which retake with the Q the d5 pawn. Probably bad, but an interesting game to go. } 4. Nc3 {My opponent didn't fall for this. Was he able to smell my idea? Moreover: was my idea a good one? (dxe6ep, fxe6, keeping b7 guarded by the lsb). I'm not sure at all. But I can think: "if my better ranged opponents is playing this, it must be provoking my inmediate move, dxf6ep, so this must be good for him, even if I can't see clearly why. So I better don't go for it, and I play a (hopefully) "safe" move, that "can't be bad" kind. (This is just a guess, and it is NOT a mock or like. It's just the way I would have thought in his position. :-)} Bc5 {So I played this move. Note: I didn't want to just take the pawn (I could have still) because I had a "feeling" that this would have been "to fall in the game he wants", so I decided for this move. I just want to surprise him. Instead of going after the pawn, just developing. I can imagine that e4 would have been the stronger move: black can defend it: against Bg2, Bf5, Qe2, Qe7, it is a tense balance - but I just decided for this one. Can it be just bad? } 5. Bg2 {Ok, I see. I can't move my lsb or d6, threatening b7. Can I live with that? I have to demonstrate it because Bc5 is nothing but a mistake. I gave up the chance to play e4, it must be for a good reason. I just have to find it! :-)} Qe7 {Threatening again e4, and this time his K is behing. I think that is the best move. I can move the Nd7, with the idea of Nb6, in order to balance the pressure. But I have to live with lsb and Ra1 trapped for a good while. } 6. d3 {Defending e4 and opening the way for the dsb (sigh!). And, more over, I gave up my pressure on d5. } c6 {I know, I know, it's a mistake. BUT if he takes the pawn, Nxc6 and my N is out, to start with, and that can't be bad. I didn't solved the b7 problems, but for the moment he can only do BxNc6, and it would be for my benefit. But my pieces are still blocked in. } 7. Bg5 {He didn't "fall" for it, I would think for the same reason as before: "if he allows it, it must be good for him, so I'll go elsewhere". This move pins my N. I can kick it with h6, and this leaves him BxN as only reasonable move (to retreat was just a loss of time). Do I want it? Welllll maybe I can exploit somehow the semiopen g column to attack his fianchetto - assuming he castles this way). Qxf6 was the safer move, threatening f2 in return. I regret now I didn't play it. } Bf5 {Ok, now I am leaving the Nb8 as guardian of c6: if dxc6, Nxc6, and black has nothing more than BxN+, bxB - and it would have solved all the power white has with a mere pair of isolated pawns... not fantastic, but affordable. } 8. Qf3 {Oh, my, this opponent wants to complicate things. The pressure on the white diagonal does NOT increase since the Q is to fall if dxc6, Nc6, QxN+, bxQ, Bxc6+, winning the Ra8. It's hard to see enough compensation. So I have to worry ONLY about the Bf5. I can try the unelegant Bg4 (or before), but this is entering an exchanging melee I was not sure I could have emerged sane. Not certainly on a blitz!} Bg6 {Not g6, because it is unwise to deprive the N from his natural defence, that shouldn't be the Q. In other words: I would have left holes to the Wdsb, as h6... horrible. This was the move. } 9. Bxf6 {Now he neutralizes me in a similar way as I wanted to avoid before. I didn't welcom exchanges, and I am not sure I could have got more than a sad draw after Q's exchange, so...} gxf6 {Surprising him, and instead to push for e4 - leaving it latent - i reinforce my own pawns and I open a g column to attack via h5-h4...} 10. Nge2 {White is confortable: he can castle either side safely, I can't. But I can live without castling. For some more moves. And I kind of try to "get something" from the position, not leaving him time to feel safe. Which it is. } e4 {May Caissa assist me. This was "Hope Chess", as I intend it: I can't fully calculate all the consecuences of this move - specially NOW and not when I should have played it. It is a sac, for sure. And I have a N LESS than before to support it... so why am I playing it now? Just bad. Nc5 had to be defended after Nxe4, so I would have lost a tempo. Otherwise, BxN and I lost my B pair for nothing. And as long as Ne2 stays where it is, and I don't castle, there is no pin threat on the e column. } 11. dxe4 {This was a mistake, since it made his e3 pawn a weakness. But it DOES NOT prevent my N to be played, still (Nd7, dxc6, Ne5, threatening the Q, Q moves, Nxc6 and it same as before: white just has BxN and it is bad. My b7 pawn would be my Life assurance while I play. b4 is impossible, and I can now press Bb4, threatening Bxe4. But he would have castled, and my pressure would fade. He has now Nf4, too. A whole other word. } Qe5 {Inviting Na4, Bd6. Now that d4 is covered by the Q. white's best: o-o-o, adding pressure on the column. IMO!} 12. O-O {If the suboptimal had been played I "must" take advantage of it. I have to live without the Bb4 plan, now useless. So I have to try the only attack I have left: } h5 {white is still able to take its own alternate advantages with Bh3. Note how the tension on the white diagonal is kept for an exceptional (I think) number of moves. I don't take the pawn because of Nxd5, putting it in a very powerful square, and he doesn't take not to free my Qside.} 13. h4 {White "sees" the disrupting h4 to come, but It was not really dangerous for white. His defence does weakens g3, but it is not nearly possible for me to exploit it, so no harm for white. I don't have a g pawn to counter on g5...} Bd6 {This does not help me much, but still wins a tempo for if Na4 was played. The tension is still unresolved by either side. } 14. Nf4 {That's ok, now: I DON'T want to take e4 anymore. I am just two pawns dawn, for no good reason! How can I defend my silly choices? } a6 {This is in order to play my c pawn wihtout fearing Nb5. Just waiting for white to attack. Something that I usually HATE... :-( :-\} 15. a3 {He doesn't know how to progress, either, and plays the same! He is preventing Bg4, or maybe preparing g4-g5... } c5 {I solved the tension, finally, in a very unsound way. I can move my b8 Nigth, my Ra8.. until Bd6 stays where it is. } 16. Nxg6 {Thank you white to give me back the g pawn. Of course, now e6 is a target for his OTHER N. } fxg6 17. b4 {Hoping in returning the pawn in order to create some threat on he Qside. Note that my way to counter W's action on the white diagonal was NOT attacking his center, but "living with it". It is playing more in my favour than in white's. } Nd7 {I won't "fall" into white's game. I have to develop. I prefer not to win a pawn but giving to life my other pieces. } 18. Ne2 {He did the present in order to play this, and he "keeps the offer". I should take advantage of my few chances now. Taking the pawn was futile. } g5 {Preventing Nf4, heading to e6. } 19. Bh3 {Ok, now: gxh4 is temping, but think that white would have Nf4, hxg3, fxg3, defending the N and opening a very dangerous battery over f7... I probably missed the win here (can anyone help me here? It's too late at night to go throug it! I'll do some other day!) The truth I felt I could live without the attack and just balance things by winning a piece. I played...} g4 {? After this I win a pice, and the game loses some interest, in my opinion. I will be only +1, but that's all. } 20. Bxg4 {?! Was it better to move the Q and leave me gxB instead? } hxg4 21. Qxg4 {This opens the way for an attack on my own!} O-O-O {The N is pinned, true, but both R are wonderful!} 22. bxc5 {Here I should have played Rd-g8 inmediately. } Bxc5 {I'm forced to take with the B, assuming black's next move. On the other side, the f2 pawn being pinned can become useful (preventing f4).} 23. Nf4 {So, at the very end, I couldn't avoid this N to head for e6! } Rdg8 {He should move the Q, to h3, f3 (if Qe6, I would have ignored it with Rxh5...)} 24. Ng6 {...but he made this strange move instead. Of course, I can't move my Rh8 from his position, or Ne7+, followed by QxRg8! But he is threatening NxQ, RxQ, NxR, winning a full R!} Kd8 {...freeing my K, preventing Ne7 to be a check, cramped white, just but for a "small" detail: A R lost on g4. So please note: I should have lost this game. with this move. } 25. Qxd7+ {Can you believe? } Kxd7 26. Nxe5+ fxe5 {...and white lost all his chances to win a R and the game. A real pity. The rest is of little interest. } 27. c4 {?} Rxh4 28. Kg2 {?} Rxe4 29. Rae1 {Here, again a choice. I opted for the risky} Rgg4 {If f6, RxR. } 30. Rxe4 Rxe4 {My pawn is still under control, as e2.} 31. Rh1 {Trying to attack the other side. Again: which is the best way to proceed? Kc8, to shield behind the a and b pawns?} Rxc4 {The material edge is all mine now, the game is lost for white. His only try is...} 32. Rh7+ Be7 {...and this was my plan: I give up a potential pressure on f2, but I hope to make WR "useless": } 33. g4 {?? I know his only chance was this, but he just can't play it right now. A difficult game that deserved much more than a mere blitz - for my rating. My opponent played quite well for a good number of moves and preventing many "traps"... he finally blundered, but still a very good perform for a 1500+/- player. } Rxg4+ 34. Kh3 Rf4 35. Kg3 Rd4 36. d6 Rxd6 {Nothing to exploit for white anymore. It honours him NOT to have gone on. The mate is still very far, but there is no hope. Please forgive my misassessements - and correct me at will! I will be grateful }
