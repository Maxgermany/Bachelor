[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B04), modern variation"]

1. e4 {I'm still trying to learn English and Queen's pawn, but this remains my most consistent opening.} Nf6 {-and this is the first time I ever encountered the Alekhine's defense at Gameknot. This possibly could explain part of the influence it had on our last game, because a lot of it reappeared in the opening...!} 2. e5 {I opened the GK database just in case; I didn't know how this opening can be played well, because this sequence often ruins beginners right here. It turned out this is the main line anyhow.} Nd5 {The best move. All other moves are blunders or hard to maintain the knight with.} 3. d4 {Also common for my "vs. beginners" line. That, and why not begin supporting a pawn with a pawn?} d6 {Prevents 4. e6! (as annotated in the last game). White could exchange here, but I don't see why either color would opt for exchanging at this moment. The center is still being contested.} 4. Nf3 {So instead I support both pawns. I'm not afraid of an eventual Bb4+, and I felt I could respond to the other bishop if it came out.} Nc6 {And here you have it. Here was where I realized the close similarities in our matches. Since it involved the Sicilian, the game where I was Black turned out to be very different (both c pawns were gone by this point) but I never stopped to think about it until I crossed this game long lost in my own databases. This game has a clear influence on our match right up until this point.} 5. c4 {Because the c pawns are still in play, my pawn can harass the knight, as seen here.} Nb6 {Not worried about c5, (Nd7 is a good square for the knight, in spite of the bishop block), and likely better than the unsupported Nb4.} 6. e6 {And notice now how important the c pawn becomes in this match. Black wants to play 6... Bxe6, but if so, then White eagerly responds with 7. d5! and so the only other option becomes...} fxe6 {Black normally likes to castle short from what I gathered in my quick glance at this opening. Now that has become a lot more dangerous, and the kingside must be remedied or lost.} 7. Nc3 {I develop more and activate the queenside a bit.} g6 {Obviously planning a fianchetto. Black clearly wants to castle quickly.} 8. h4 {So here I decide to aim for O-O-O and respond with a kingside pawn storm. If my plan continues, Black's King is going to have some serious issues very shortly...} Bg7 {So their plan continues...} 9. h5 {As does mine. Now, I'm sure something else could have been played, but Black clearly realizes now the danger of what their plan may hold. Even so, as for this next move...} Kf7 {It doesn't take too much thought to see why this could be viewed as terribly dangerous. Even with the goal of exchange in my mind, surely Black has better options...!} 10. Ng5+ {Demonstrating now why the king's castling rights shouldn't have been spent to g6. Now h7 is under attack as well.} Ke8 {Now Black has moved the king for nothing.} 11. Bd3 {Planning an all out assault on the kingside, and O-O-O looks even stronger for White now.} Kd7 {Very crowded for the king, but it needs to hide away from the opposite side of the board at this point. Effectively now, the Kingside becomes an epic battleground where no king should wander...} 12. Nf7 {This was my most clear mistake in the match, I think. Yes, I have the rook for a knight now, but...} Qf8 {...I didn't realize the dual purpose of Black's king hiding away at this point. It was to strengthen the back rank via the queen. Now I must exchange right here and now, and be extremely cautious and aware of f2's defenses....} 13. Nxh8 {Forced, as noted.} Bxh8 {The position is not hopeless for Black, as I once thought here! I told myself that with the rook gone, I could continue blasting away at the Kingside...} 14. hxg6 {...as you see here....} Bxd4 {But now I realize how vulnerable my defenses really were. f2 is under major heavy fire...!!!} 15. Qe2 {And here was where I held my breath. IF I played Rf1, then I abandon my control of the Kingside. The black bishop blocks Nd4, but Nb4 is almost as strong. If I lose that LSB, my kingside goes unstable, but then I must play Bb1 and all hopes of near-future castling are gone.} hxg6 {Thankfully, they didn't see it! But my issues are far from over and I take another hard moment to think.} 16. Be3 {As far as playable options are concerned, I felt this move gave me the most relief in what I could play. Now, if Nb4...} Qf6 {And there you have it. I can no longer castle, or I risk unraveling my defenses after Bxc3.} 17. Rc1 {So now my final developing piece must play a defending role. Luckily, my king is still safe for now, and I have a certain plan in mind involving keeping my rooks active in both roles...} e5 {d4 is now under undisputed Black control. I'm not terribly worried yet, though.} 18. Rh6 {This move now completes the kingside flank I tried so hard to maintain. Things are starting to look good and playable for me again, and the queen must hide to a less favorable square- and yet, Black immediately resigns here! The position is equal in material, and I don't see how I have a totally secured tempo over Black even after some checks. What do you think, reader? Was Black's game utterly hopeless here? And why did the existence of both c pawns in this game matter so much? Thanks for your time to look over this match in the meantime! :)}
