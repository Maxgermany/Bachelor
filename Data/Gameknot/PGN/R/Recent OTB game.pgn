1. d4 Nf6 {My friend chooses not to fight the battle on Classical lines.} 2. c4 g6 {I know what's coming, but cannot avoid it.} 3. Nc3 d5 {The Gruenfeld, sure enough.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 {I immediately relieve Black of his central Pawn and he recaptures.} 5. e4 Nxc3 {Now I have my "ideal center", but Black has exchanged off my supporting Knight.} 6. bxc3 c5 {Pressuring my QP. This Pawn will be the focal point of the battle for a few moves.} 7. Bc4 Bg7 {Seizing the long diagonal. } 8. Ne2 Nc6 {We both add more firepower to my Q4.} 9. Be3 cxd4 {Black knocks a prop out from Q4 with this exchange.} 10. cxd4 Qa5+ {Black plays aggressively. The Queen is exposed a bit but also generates potent threats.} 11. Bd2 Qa3 {Now the Q is dangerously exposed and I start thinking how tro win it. Hoowver, my QP is under fire.} 12. Rb1 {If Black greedily plays 12... NxP??? without thinking, 13 B-N4!!! wins the Queen!} O-O {Black castles his K into safety. I should have done the same thing, but I had a devious plan: 13 P-Q5 and after the Knight moves, 14 B-N4 winning the Q.} 13. d5 {Here we go....} Ne5 {...the Knight moves...} 14. Bb4 {...and I seemingly win the Q.} Qf3 {I thought he'd at least play 14... QxB and get SOMETHING for the Q. But...  I} 15. gxf3 {My only chance to prolong the game was 15 O-O, but 15... QxKP wouyld leave me in a difficult position anyway.} Nxf3+ {Forcing my next move.} 16. Kf1 Bh3# {What a lovely finish! Even though I lost I felt it just HAD to be posted.}
