[Opening "Old Benoni defence (A43)"]

1. d4 {I was Black in this game. This game demonstrates how I fought back in a hopeless position to swindle my opponent in an important tournament game.} c5 {The Benoni defense. I challenge White's centre instantly.} 2. c3 {2.d5 is the sharpest line. 2.c3 is equally good, but goes into an entirely different opening. 2.c3 is better than 2.e3 because in the 2.c3 variation, White still has the option of playing for an e4 central boost, but it would take a lot more moves in the 2.e3 variation. And also, 2.c3 doesn't block in the queen's bishop as in 2.e3.} Nf6 {This move stops White's e4 central boost. I also could've stopped it with 2...d5, going into a Slav (d4 d5 c4 c6) game with reversed colors.} 3. Nf3 {White shouldn't take on c5 and try to hold the pawn because it will weaken his queenside and eventually I will get the pawn back with a better position.} e6 {This is the most flexible move.} 4. Bg5 {White is now threatening an e4 boost.} Qc7 5. e3 {If White takes on f6, then I will have a potential kingside attack after ...Rg8 ...d5 ...b6 ...Bd6 ...e5.} b6 {Central pawns are very important in this opening, so now if White trades on c5, he'll be trading a central d-pawn for a flank b-pawn.} 6. Bd3 {White is developing and strengthening his position while I am trying to make the accurate moves to counter his central control.} Bb7 {Stopping an e4 boost} 7. Nbd2 {Threatening the e4 boost again. I was overly concerned with White playing e4. White has already moved his e-pawn so it shouldn't be a big deal if he moves it again.} Nd5 {Now if White plays 8.e4, I have 8...Nf4 threatening White's bishop and the g2-pawn. And if 9.Bxf4, then I will have the strong bishop pair to use later in the game.} 8. O-O Nc6 9. a3 {Threatening to boost with b4, and also threatening to boost with c4. I wasn't very familiar with this opening, so somewhere I have made an inaccuracy allowing these threats.} a5 {White playing b4 is more of a threat than c4, because b4 gains a lot of space and gives White a potential queenside attack, while c4 doesn't do much to help White's position, it just kicks away my annoying knight on d5.} 10. c4 Nde7 11. Bf4 d6 {Moving my queen is too passive and White is already overcoming me positionally. His pieces are better placed, and his position is much more solid. I was very lucky to have won this game.} 12. Ne4 {Attacking my weak d-pawn.} e5 {Playing Rd8 or O-O-O is terrible, because White can play the crushing dxc5, winning at least a pawn since my d-pawn is pinned to my queen.} 13. dxe5 dxe5 14. Bg3 {Now I have a Maroczy-type setup because of my pawns on c5 and e5. I must be careful not to overextend my kingside pawns, because if I play 14...f5? then my pinned e-pawn will be weaker, and the white minor pieces will have access to a lot of weak squares on my third rank.} O-O-O {I was desperate to create some kind of imbalance here, and I was afraid of White's minor pieces if I castled kingside. Castling queenside is risky especially when you have overextended queenside pawns, but I needed some kind of imbalance if I wanted to stay alive in this game. White's pieces are clearly more active and better placed.} 15. Qb3 {This relieves the d-file pin and directs some pressure toward my castled king.} Nf5 {I force a trade of my passive knight for White's stronger bishop.} 16. Bc2 {White is simply relocating his unimportant piece to a safer place.} Nxg3 17. hxg3 {This looks like the best move, but I thought fxg3 was better. Even though it isolates White's e-pawn, it gives White a strong open f-file and makes it harder for me to start a kingside storm.} h6 {I was losing the will to play at this point. Positions like this aren't really my style, and I tend to make random moves.  I play better in tactical positions with lots of space. Not cramped positional positions like in this game.} 18. Nc3 {White is bringing in pieces to attack my king.} Na7 {I was too bored and sick of playing this "not-my-style" game to see White's crushing move of Na4.} 19. Na4 {White takes advantage of my backward b-pawn and will win a pawn.} Rd6 {My b-pawn covering my king is more important than my e-pawn.} 20. Nxe5 Rf6 {I was starting to feel a little better here when I realized I had a potential kingside attack. Something that always gives me the will to play.} 21. Nf3 {White missed a very strong move here. If he plays 21.Bf5  then his bishop is untouchable. If I play 21...Rxf5, then White plays 22.Nxb6  and if I have to play 22...Kd8 allowing 23.Qd3  picking up my rook, because if I play 22...Kb8, then 23.Ned7  is almost mate and I have to sacrifice my queen.} h5 {I plan to storm the kingside, and White's crushing move doesn't work here since his knight is no longer active near my king.} 22. e4 {Now White is the one with the Maroczy-type setup. A common strategy in Maroczy positions is to get a knight on the strong outpost d5. If White plays e5 at some point during the game, I can simply move the rook to the h-file to strengthen my ensuing attack.} h4 {Most likely I will get this pawn back, but I'm already down a pawn so material shouldn't be my concern. I will take any chance I need to launch a kingside attack in my desperate position.} 23. gxh4 {White has to be careful not to fall for Nxh4? because then I play g5 and Rfh6, and White is in trouble along the wide open h-file.} g5 {This time White can't take the pawn. Playing Nxg5 allows me to recapture the h-pawn and White is in trouble along the h-file. And playing hxg5 allows Rxf3! chopping off the defender of the h7 mating square. Always check for tactical threats like this when your opponent purposely hangs a pawn or piece.} 24. Rfd1 {White realizes my attack is stronger than what it seemed to be a few moves ago, and clears way to escape his king into the centre.} g4 {In just a few moves, I went from having a totally passive losing position, to getting a lot of strong counterplay on the kingside, thereby justifying me castling queenside.} 25. Ne1 Rxh4 {Now I'm only one pawn down, and White's queenside attack has been stalled because now he must defend.} 26. Kf1 {Fleeing.} b5 {I take this opportunity to free the pressure on my king's position.} 27. cxb5 Nxb5 {Now Qxb5?? is impossible because of my sneaky Ba6!!} 28. Qe3 {White is trying to counterattack me. If he gets my c-pawn (or even removes it from the c-file with b4), then he will have a lot of strong attacking possibilities along the c-file.} g3 {Continuing my attack.} 29. f3 Nd4 {I take away the king's only escape square. Now White's only chance to survive is to sacrifice with Rxd4 and try for a counterattack on my king. And blocking with Qg1?? is no good because of Rfh6!!} 30. Bd3 {White has overlooked that his king has no escape squares, and must lose his queen next move. Even though my winning this game was based on White's blunder here, it still shows that launching a desperate counterattack will pay off, because if I had remained in my passive position, White would never have been in a position to make a blunder.} Rh1+ {You should've seen the look on his face.} 31. Qg1 Rxg1+ 32. Kxg1 {The game isn't over yet. Having an extra queen for a rook and a pawn isn't that big a material advantage, and there are still a lot of pieces on the board to work with.} Bd6 {My bishop is headed for e3.} 33. Nc2 {White wants my knight off the d4 outpost.} Nxc2 34. Bxc2 Bf4 35. Kf1 {White makes a preparatory move.} Ba6+ 36. Bd3 Bxd3+ 37. Rxd3 c4 {Not completely necessary.} 38. Rd5 Rh6 39. Ke2 {Stopping Rh1 } Rd6 40. Rad1 {Allowing piece trades is usally bad for the side down in material, but it is fine here because my rook will be strong if it gets to d2. } Rxd5 41. Rxd5 {Threatening Rc5.} Kb7 42. Nc5+ Ka8 {My plan is to safeguard my king and get my queen to f2 where I can eat White's kingside pawns and promote my g-pawn.} 43. Na4 {I'm guessing White wanted to maneuver his knight to the more active b5 square.} Qa7 {My queen is headed to f2 to eat the kingside pawns, and I'll play Bd6 if Black tries to block on c5.} 44. Rd8+ Bb8 {Now my king is safe and Qf2 is unstoppable.} 45. Kd2 {White needs his king to help attack my king. If he doesn't do this, then Qf2  forces his king onto the back rank where his attack is hopeless.} Qf2+ 46. Kc3 Qxg2 47. Rd7 {Threatening Nb6 checkmate.} Qxf3+ 48. Kxc4 Qxe4+ 49. Kb5 {The game still isn't over, because White has some nasty threats against my king, and my g-pawn hasn't promoted yet.} Qb7+ {This is the fastest way to win. I can afford to give up my queen for his rook because my g-pawn will promote soon, leaving me simply up a full queen. And Qf5  is dubious, because it may look like I can still force a queen sacrifice, but White can play Ka6, and Qxd7 isn't possible because of Nb6 mate! A horrible way to have lost.} 50. Nb6+ {If play continued Rxb7 Kxb7 Nc3 g2 Ne2, then I could win with Bh2, or a simpler way to win would be to start advancing my f-pawn, and White's king is too slow to get back to the kingside. Although Nb6 loses faster.} Ka7 {Now White can resign. There is no hope for him here. His knight is pinned and my king is perfectly safe.} 51. Rxb7+ Kxb7 52. Nc4 g2 {White resigned. Once I promote my pawn, winning should be no problem for me. This game goes to show that fighting back in a seemingly hopeless position can give you extreme payoffs. And it also good for you psychologically because sometimes your winning opponent will be too arrogant or impatient to defend and take your threats seriously.}
