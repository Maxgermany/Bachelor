1. e4 {This game ends the drought I've been having.  Starts of the typical e4.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {I've never really liked this move for white because of black being able to force the bishop to waste a tempo or two while gaining the center.} e6 4. a3 a6 5. Nc3 b5 6. Ba2 Nc6 7. d3 Be7 8. Bf4 Nf6 9. h3 O-O 10. Qe2 Bb7 {We've developed into a closed style structure.  I'm looking to attempt to possibly break with d5.} 11. g4 {I'd prefer white to keep is king on the king side since I'm already winning the pawn race.} Nd4 12. Nxd4 cxd4 13. Nb1 {Opening up the cfile for assault. } Nd7 14. Nd2 Nb6 15. Nf3 Na4 16. O-O-O Rc8 17. Nxd4 {? allows black to gain two pieces for a rook and pawn.} e5 18. Ne6 fxe6 19. Bxe6+ {White now has the option of taking the c8 rook.} Kh8 20. Be3 {White allows me to save my rook to do one piece for two pawns.} Qc7 {I decide however that I like the pressure on the king better than the the rook on c8.} 21. Bxc8 Rxc8 22. f4 {White tries to break the center open to activate the rooks in order to get some life in his game.} d5 {I want to open the playing field up for my bishops.} 23. exd5 Bxd5 24. Rhf1 Bb3 {Threating the simple Bxc2 and then discoveries. } 25. Rd2 b4 {Attempting to break open the kings position. } 26. Kb1 {The bishop is now threatened and I couldn't find a good way to keep it where it is.  Bd5 was possible but I was thinking about the back rank mate threats white could have after fxe5.} Bg8 27. axb4 Bxb4 28. Rdd1 {?? here is the critical error c3 was a slightly better choice though I haven't looked at it completely.  I was thinking c3 and if black decided on a sac Bxc3 white would play Rc2, trying to hold down the defense.  27. axb4 may have been bad since it allows for the following combination.  Have you found it yet?} Nc3+ {!! and the game ends.  White must either give up the queen or face forced mate.  Though after the queen goes off whites life is going to be short so it might as well be forced mate here.  Ka1 Qa5# Kc1 Ne2++ Kb1 Qxc2+ Ka1 Qa4+ Kb1 Qa2#.} 29. bxc3 Bxc3 {White must find a way to stop Qa5 Qa1# which would have happened in game, and Qb7+ Qb2#.} 30. Qf2 {Blocking Qb7+ but misses the Qa5 matting idea.} Qa5 {}
