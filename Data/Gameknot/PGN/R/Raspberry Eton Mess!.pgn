1. e4 {Hi Everyone!  Had another grim lesson on tactics by The Great One, GM Cyrano.  He allowed me to execute a pawn fork in the middlegame and then proceeded to show me why he allowed it.

This move is characterised by c6 invented by Horatio Caro.  The idea of this is so that I can play a later d5, leaving e5 as an option and not hemming in Fou Leblanc (my light square bishop).} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {3. e5 - Afro chooses the Advanced Variation.} Bf5 4. Nc3 e6 {4. ...... e6 - Fou Leblanc resides outside the f7 - d5 pawn chain.} 5. g4 Bg6 6. Nge2 c5 7. h4 {7. h4 - it's the sort of thing the Master Mater would do - advance the g and h pawns (before castling kingside) and deter me from castling kingside.  Here, Fou Leblanc is under the hammer and soon I will have to play h6 or h5 to create a bolt-hole for him.} h5 8. Nf4 Bh7 9. Nxh5 cxd4 10. Nb5 {10. Nb5 - if Qxd4 then Bxc2.} Nc6 11. Nxd4 Nxe5 12. Bb5+ Nd7 13. Bg5 {13. Bg5 - Glenda is under fire - I now block the attack by playing Ne7 but this will block Fou Lenoir in - in fact he will be permanently tied down to defending the pawn on g6.} Ne7 14. Qe2 a6 15. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {15. ...... Qxd7 - B for N trade.} 16. O-O-O O-O-O {16. ....... 0-0-0 - It seemed a good idea at the time but Henry is gonna be just as vulnerable on the queenside as on the kingside.} 17. Rh3 Kb8 18. Rf3 Bg6 19. Nf4 Be4 {19. ..... Be4 - threatening e5 forking the two knights.  Afro allows this but as per my earlier note .......} 20. Rc3 e5 21. Nb3 {21. Nb3 - threatening Nc5.} Rc8 22. Qxe4 exf4 {22. ....... exf4 - there seemed nothing better but it does leave two lurvely diagonals for Afro's dsb to fatally annoy Henry.} 23. Qxf4+ Ka8 24. Qxf7 {24. Qxf7 - sssssss and double sssssss - in comes the Wicked Witch of the West and she will wreak devastation - she has taken my f7 pawn for starters.  The main course is yet to come.} Rxc3 25. bxc3 Qd6 26. Re1 {26. Re1 - this is the main course - a little bit of horsemeat for Afro, I move my knight out of the way but it allows something a whole lot worse.} Qa3+ {26. ....... Qa3+ - this proves to be little more than a spite check.} 27. Kd2 Nc6 28. Re8+ {28. Re8+ - nasty!} Ka7 29. Be3+ d4 {29. ..... d4 - this block is as flimsy as a meringue and Afro's steed will crush it.} 30. Nxd4 {30. Nxd4 - So, here is the desert, my friends, this capture will ensure that I will lose very heavy material, starting with the loss of the rook on h8 if I block the checking diagnoal with Bc5.  If I move Henry to b3 then Ne6 disc check winning Fou Lenoir to start off with.  My position is a complete and utter crushed raspberry and double cream meringue Eton Mess.  To save myself the bother of writing a resignation note I decided to finally move that wretched g7 pawn allowing instant ........} g6 31. Nxc6# {31. Nxc6 MATE!! ........ death.  I am playing another game against Afro, it is still in play so I cannot say any more, apart from, touch wood, so far, it is an improvement on this one whatever the end result!}
