[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Yusupov-Rubinstein system"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 {Unusual but very solid. c4 is more popular } b6 {Classical player will go for d5, agressive player can try c5 at once. I choose the queen's indian.} 4. Bd3 Bb7 5. Nbd2 c5 {Start the fight for the center.} 6. O-O Be7 7. b3 {Best results according to GK database.} O-O 8. Bb2 d6 9. c4 Nbd7 10. Qe2 {Connecting rook. White is better and prepare e4, then an attack on the kingside with the help of the 2 rocket-like bishops.} d5 {So black prevent e4} 11. Rfd1 {If Rae1 to go e4 anyway Ne4, so white puts rook on c and d files, that can be open at will. Another plan was 11.Ne5 followed by f4 and Ndf3.} Ne4 12. Rac1 f5 {So eventually, black choose the plan he would have suggested for white. I still prefer white here because it is ahead in development.} 13. Ne5 Nxe5 {Not sure that allowing a pawn on e5 is good, but his knight was better than mine, and white black-square bishop can no longer threaten my king.} 14. dxe5 Qe8 {!? Blacks idea is to bring the queen on the kingside and launch an attack against the king. By the way, prevent white queen to enter on h5.} 15. f4 {Prevent black to play f4. But the e4 knight cannot by pushed away by f3. Thus after Nxe4 or Bxe4, the pawn structure would be frozen in the center, and the bishop would feel useless.} g5 {?! Black try to mess a bit the position and plan some Qg6, Kf7, Rh8, Rg8, h5 ideas. Interesting, but a bit too optimistic maybe. Center is not closed yet.} 16. cxd5 exd5 {Obviously, not Bxd5 ? that loose a pawn. Now, black as a weakness on d5, and the e6 pawn cannot be blocked efficientely (where as gone my 2nd knight ?)} 17. Kh1 gxf4 18. exf4 Qg6 19. Rdf1 Qh6 {With the basic threat Ng3.Rac8-c6-g6 would have been a better plan (well, Qh6 is not a plan at all).} 20. Rf3 {Bxe4 dxe (if fxe, f5), c4! would have give big trouble to black. "When attacked on a side, counter attack on the center."} Bh4 {Threatening Bg3, h3 Bxf4.} 21. Kg1 Kf7 {I want to bring a rook in via g8} 22. Rh3 {White saw an opportunity to grab my Bishop and went for it. Bxe4 first seems mor safe.} Rfg8 {22...Qxf4 ? 23.Rf1 (Qh5+ looks promising too) Qg5, 24.Nf3} 23. Nf3 {I was expecting g3 at once. Not sure what a would have done. May be Nxg3But I'm not really confident in black chances.} Rg4 24. Kf1 Qxf4 25. g3 {Here I was quite afraid of Rc2 followed by Bc1 and black can resign. The text move, looks good but...} Rxg3 26. hxg3 {Forced, Rxh4 Rxf3+ Kmove Qg3+} Nxg3+ 27. Rxg3 {Obviously forced} Bxg3 28. Rc2 d4 {! Attacking the pined knight} 29. Kg2 {Protect the knigh and prepare to push the queen with Bc1, after what black can breath a bit.} Bh4 {And not Rg8?? Bc4. Here white sportively resigned as Qg3+ cannot be prevented.  Please, feel free to add any comments.}
