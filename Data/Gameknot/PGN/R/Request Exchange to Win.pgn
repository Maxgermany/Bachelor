1. e4 {Hi all; here's a brief by-request annotation of a recent game. This particular game shows how one small mistake early on can cascade into an unwinnable position over the course of the game. Enjoy!} e5 2. Nf3 f5 {I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games. It makes for very sharp, decisive play, where the game may hang in the balance on every move.} 3. d3 {Too passive a continuation for my tastes, but safer than the main lines (3.Nxe5, 3.Bc4, 3.exf4, 3.d4).} Nc6 {A waiting move. This Knight frequently proves hard to develop in this opening, so I prefer to get it into play early.} 4. Be3 {White's play is solid, if passive. This Bishop usually develops to g5 (or beyond!)} d6 5. c3 {Inaccurate, but not deadly by any means. This move doesn't have any real effect except to hinder White's QN's development. As I mentioned earlier, d2-d4 was playable all the way back at move 3; it didn't need support.} Nf6 {Black continues development while pressuring the White center.} 6. Nbd2 {? And here, suddenly, unexpectedly, White throws away a piece with a subtle mistake. The thing to notice is that with this move, White's Bishop is trapped.} f4 {And now Black wins the Bishop for a pawn. It's worth mentioning right now, I think, that White's play is very solid for the rest of the game. 6.Nbd2 was the only real mistake.} 7. Bxf4 exf4 8. Ng5 {I like 8.Be2 better; this doesn't serve much of a purpose and loses a move.} h6 9. Ngf3 Be6 10. Be2 Qd7 {White looks like he's planning to go kingside, so Black prepares to castle queenside and aims a battery toward the WK along the c8-h3 diagonal.} 11. Qa4 {White's play is a little scattered, but not at all bad. Here he begins to make queenside threats, to discourage Black from castling.} g5 {Shoring up the weak pawn.} 12. Nd4 {White's plans begin to take form; he piles up on the Nc6.} Bg4 {There's no real need to deal with the queenside pressure yet, so Black offers a trade. Normally it's disadvantageous to trade a good Bishop for a bad one (as here), but Black is following a single very simple principle: when ahead in material (especially by a whole piece), trade pieces.} 13. Bxg4 Nxg4 14. O-O Bg7 {Even the best place for Black's extra Bishop isn't great right now with so much mass on the board, so he aims it at the White Knight to create pressure.} 15. Nd2f3 {White defends.} a6 {Black finally blocks up the WQ's pressure on a7, and as a result lessens the burden on c6 as well.} 16. Qb3 O-O-O {Defending b7 and getting the last Rook into play.} 17. h3 {White drives off this pesky Knight, though there is danger to remember when pushing pawns in front of your King--especially when the opponent already has advanced pawns to poke at the weakness.} Nge5 {Threatening d3 momentarily, but take a very broad look at the board. Black is ahead in material, but it doesn't really *feel* like he's all that far ahead. His extra Bishop is lounging on g7, not pointed at anything in particular and in fact cluttering up the g-file, making direct attacks on the WK more difficult. Remember this feeling, that Black is ahead but not overwhelmingly so.} 18. Nxe5 {The computer doesn't mind this, but I think it's a slight mistake of thought process. If Black is seeking to trade pieces, it makes sense that White should oppose him in that endeavor. The fewer pieces on the board, the bigger the difference that Black's extra Bishop will make. Now Black has several options for his next move. Given the goal of trading pieces as much as possible, what is the best choice?} Nxd4 {! I think this is it. Black ensures that at the very least all the Knights will leave the board, and perhaps more.} 19. Nxd7 Nxb3 20. axb3 Rxd7 {Off goes the material! Remember the feeling of Black not having *that* big an advantage? Well, he's still up the same Bishop for a pawn, but that difference suddenly is looking a lot more meaningful, isn't it?} 21. Rfd1 c5 {With pieces off the board and a Bishop staring at the queenside, Black needs to start thinking about pawn action.} 22. d4 {This is an interesting thought, isolating Black's d-pawn after 22...cxd4 23.cxd4, but also isolating the doubled White b-pawns. I don't think the trade is worth it (that said, I'm not sure what's better. Perhaps 22.f3).} cxd4 23. c4 {Another interesting thought, keeping the pawns together for greater strength and hoping to take out the passed d-pawn later.} Re8 24. f3 Kc7 25. b4 Kb6 26. Kh2 {I do think it's worth mentioning that this is a very strange move. White ought to be moving his King toward the center so he can help with the final Rook-pawn-Bishop struggle by supporting positions and blockading pawns. In the corner like this, the King is not a liability, but he's also useless.} Ra8 27. b5 Rdd8 {In what is essentially a simple Rook-and-pawn endgame, it sure is nice to have an ace in the hole--a Bishop reaching all the way across the board, able to control key squares.} 28. b4 {It's not a big deal at this point, but this does lose a pawn. The simpler 28.bxa6 was better.} axb5 29. Rac1 Ra4 30. c5+ {White's play does not lack for guts!} dxc5 31. bxc5+ Kc6 32. Rd3 {Critically blockading the d-pawn, but Black's King is well-placed and he has the resources to force a footman through.} Rc4 {This Rook secures everything.} 33. Rb1 Kxc5 34. Re1 {There's nothing better for this Rook to do.} Rc3 {Forcing the issue of the blockaded pawn.} 35. Rxc3+ {35.Rdd1 was stiffer. This allows Black to connect his pawns, and also lets his Bishop control the queening square (c1).} dxc3 36. Rc1 Rd2 {Covered by the Bishop, Black is free to simply push on to victory.} 37. Kg1 c2 {0-1. The coming 38...Bb2 and 39...c1=Q are unstoppable, so White throws in the towel after a very well-fought game. Many thanks to chicoboy for a fantastic struggle. Comments are appreciated; thanks for reading!}
