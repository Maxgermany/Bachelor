[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B04), modern, Larsen variation"]

1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I played a game with a Master which I lost which involved a 2 piece endgame and with me having the remote queenside pawn majority and my opponent a strong central pawn majority.  I would have thought that in my experience with opponents with remote pawn majorities and losing that my queenside pawn majority should have won through.  I did manage to promote my b pawn but alas, Glenda did not stay on the field for very long.  After her departure I was just 3 pawns down without any further play so I decided to call it a day then.  Master Freddy responds to e4 with Nf6 (the Alekhine's Defense).  Alexander Alekhine was a very strong grandmaster with a rating of about 3000.  That defense, although it does encourage pawns to attack the horse does have a sting in the sense that the pawns can overreach themselves by advancing too far.} Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 dxe5 5. Nxe5 {5. Nxe5 - two centralised knights of opposite colour - interesting.} c6 6. Be2 Nd7 7. c4 Nxe5 8. cxd5 Ng6 9. dxc6 bxc6 {9. ........ bxc6 - both sides are left with isolanis - me with a IQP and black with his isolated c pawn.  Which is better or worse I wonder?  Anyhow, my queenside pieces need to shift themselves and Henry needs to be tucked away.  I start with Henry by playing 10. 0-0.} 10. O-O e6 11. Be3 Bd6 12. Nd2 O-O 13. Nf3 {13. Nf3 - over the past few moves I have cleared the queenside back ranks and only Glenda sits between the two castles.  My knight moves to f3 to support the IQP.} Qa5 14. a3 Ba6 15. Bxa6 Qxa6 16. Qc2 {16. Qc2 - connects my two rooks and Glenda eyes up the weak c pawn which is protected at the moment, but I see no harm in starting to put some pressure on.} Qb5 17. Rac1 Rfc8 18. a4 Qd5 {18. ....... Qd5 - black keeps his queen centralised.  However, there will soon be a plethora of exchanges.} 19. Qc4 Rab8 20. Qxd5 cxd5 21. Rxc8+ Rxc8 22. Rc1 Rxc1+ 23. Bxc1 {23. Bxc1 - Volia.} Ne7 24. Bd2 Nc6 {24. ........ Nc6 - black redeploys his knight to the queenside hitting out at my IQP.  I now move Henry towards the centre in accordance with endgame guidelines.} 25. Kf1 f6 26. Ke2 Kf7 27. Kd3 {27. Kd3 - a natural move but I think this is a mistake because my position appears to go down south from here.  At least I get rid of my IQP but I allow black to have a strong pawn centre.  I cannot do anything with my queenside pawn majority at present because b4 is twice attacked by black's dsb and that wretched knight.  I have to take because of a threatened pawn fork on e4 and as I said, a pawn exchanged is better than a pawn lost.} e5 28. dxe5 fxe5 29. Ng5+ {29. Ng5  - I am wondering whether I should have played Ne1 followed by Nc2 backing up b4 to enable me to shift that queenside pawn majority up the board.  You the jury decide.} Kg6 30. g3 h6 31. Nh3 e4+ 32. Kc2 d4 {32. ......... d4 - the central pawns look really menacing.} 33. Nf4+ Kf5 34. h3 g5 35. Ng2 Ne5 36. b4 {36. b4 - I now finally push up that pawn majority but I now find I have left it too late.  Master Freddy now moves his knight to d3 and says "Gotcha".  Yup, he has.  I will now drop my f pawn for starters but I decide to play on a few more moves to see what I can make of that queenside pawn majority.} Nd3 37. h4 Nxf2 38. hxg5 hxg5 {38. ....... hxg5 - this exchange of pawns rules out the chance of black getting a passed h pawn, but he will now get a passed g pawn.  3 passers against 1, ouch!} 39. b5 Bxg3 40. a5 Ng4 41. b6 axb6 42. axb6 e3 43. Ba5 {43. Ba5 - a rather unfortunate choice of square as you will see later on.} Ke4 44. b7 {44. b7 - I push my pawn as far as I can for now.} d3+ 45. Kd1 e2+ 46. Kd2 Ne3 47. b8=Q {47. b8/Q and resigns.  I decide to resign because I realised just after I crowned my pawn that black did not have to play BxQ allowing NxN leaving me with a piece against his 3 passers.  He could always play Nc4  getting his knight out of the line of fire and then picking Glenda off next move.  I now decide to wave the white flag and concede one rating point pegging back my rating to 1759.  At least I was involved in an endgame with a player rated more than 2000, in fact in this instance, a Master where I started with even material.  Pity I could not maintain it.  Cheers.  Joanne.}
