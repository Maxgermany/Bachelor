1. e4 {I am White. My opponent is a kid I played in a tournament in San Francisco. And later I analyzed the game with his father. So I thought I'd share the game and analysis with gameknot.} c5 2. d4 {On Gameknot I usually play 2.c3 here, but I prefer more eradic exciting openings in over the board play, especially when there's only 45 minutes on the clock.} cxd4 3. c3 {The Smith-Morra Gambit. If Black accepts the free pawn, then I will have a strong central control with my knight on c3, pawn on e4, and my queen controlling the d-file. It is very risky to accept free pawns in the opening, because by wasting a move to take a pawn, you're giving your opponent tempo, so don't accept free pawns if you're not prepared to take the risk.} g6 {I call this "Coward's Defense." I always accept this gambit when I play this opening as Black, because after properly defending, Black can usually hold onto the extra pawn. Black probably wasn't familiar with this opening, so he felt uncomfortable taking the pawn.} 4. cxd4 {By not accepting the pawn, Black has given me a good pawn centre.} d5 {Black wants to break my centre.} 5. exd5 {I considered playing e5, but I thought it was slightly overextensive, and I like wide open tactical games rather than the slower strategic game that would have arisen if I'd played e5.} Nf6 {5...Qxd5 isn't good because I can gain a developing tempo with Nc3, and just one extra tempo is all it takes to win in an open game like this. In closed cramped positions, one tempo isn't very important. Black's best chance to get equality is to take the pawn with the knight, where it won't cost him a tempo.} 6. Bb5+ {I develop a piece while stalling the loss of my d5-pawn. This position can actually occur from my normal 2.c3 opening after (e4 c5 c3 g6 d4 cxd4 cxd4 d5 exd5 Nf6 Bb5 ) and can also occur from the Caro-Kann Defense after (e4 c6 d4 d5 exd5 cxd5 c4 Nf6 cxd5 g6 Bb5 )} Nbd7 {6...Bd7 is worse because the bishop doesn't do anything on d7 except block the queen's attacking path to my isolated pawns, and after I play Bc4, Black will have a hard time trying to get his pawn back, and I can complete my development a lot easier than Black.} 7. Nc3 {I'm going to lose my weak d5-pawn eventually, but the more I try to hold onto it, the longer it'll keep disturbing Black's development.} a6 {Black wants to drive my bishop away so he can continue his plan to get back his pawn, and maybe even get my other d-pawn since it is also weak.} 8. Ba4 b5 9. Bb3 Nb6 {Now Black has made it clear that he will get his pawn back.} 10. Qf3 {I hold the pawn a little longer while developing a piece, so that maybe my pressure along the h1-a8 diagonal will compensate for my other weak d-pawn.} Bb7 {Now Black has enough forces on my pawn to finally get it back.} 11. Nh3 {While Black is busy getting his pawn back, I make my own plan to attack on the kingside where Black isn't developed.} Nbxd5 {I thought it was too early for Black to be getting his pawn back. Remember what I said about it being risky to waste a move to take a free pawn? Black should've developed his kingside with Bg7 and O-O before taking the pawn. Even though it gives me more time to try to hold the pawn, Black has enough potential forces in his camp to get the pawn back eventually, and then try to get my other isolated d-pawn.} 12. Ng5 {Now I have a lot of annoying threats Black needs to look out for. His f6 knight is pinned to his f-pawn and to his d5-knight, while his d5-knight is also pinned to his f-pawn, not to mention his b7-bishop. } h6 {Not the best move. Black shouldn't be weakening his kingside while he isn't even castled, and should be finishing developing before my superior pieces crush his position.} 13. Nge4 {Black's pointless pawn push doesn't give him a tempo. It actually loses a tempo because h6 isn't an important positional move, it's actually a weakening move (explained later) and it also gives me time to make threats against Black's position which is lacking in development. My immidiate threat is Nxf6 } Nxe4 {This is the only way to stop Nxf6. 13...e6 doesn't neutralize the threat because it takes a defender from the f6-knight, allowing 14. Nxf6  Qxf6 15. Bxd5! winning a piece. You must always be aware of tactical threats when playing wide open positions like this.} 14. Qxe4 {I'm happy with my position, because I'm ahead in development due to Black's wasted Nbxd5 and h6 moves, and my isolated d-pawn isn't really a weakness right now, because it has potential defenders, and it's controlling the centre.} e6 {Black has to defend his pinned knight, and Nxc3 doesn't work because after Qxb7, Black's knight will be under attack, but I will also be threatening Qc6  forcing Black's queen to leave the defense of the a8-rook, so Black wouldn't have been able to counter both threats, and I would win material.} 15. O-O {I calmy castle while I am waiting for a chance to exploit my lead in development to get a winning advantage. This will probably take awhile to do, but Black's next few greedy moves give me that opportunity.} Nxc3 {This inaccuracy only worsens Black's position. Black should be defending and completing his development.} 16. Qxb7 {My slight lead in development has turned into a bigger advantage due to Black's bad move. Black has made a simple piece trade, but now his knight is under attack and my queen is strongly placed on b7 where it controls the 7th rank.} Ne2+ {16...Na4 loses a pawn after 17. Bxa4 bxa4 18. Qc6  Ke7 (18...Qd7 hangs rook) 18. Qxa4, winning the pawn while stranding Black's king in the centre. And 16...Nd5 is totally losing, because I win material after Bxd5 exd5 Re1  Be7 Rxe7 !! Always look for tactics like that in wide open positions, especially if your opponent's position isn't solid and he is lacking in development.} 17. Kh1 {Obviously forced.} Nxd4 {This move loses the game the fastest, but Black's position is already losing. Black will have complications after Nxc1 Raxc1, because I will have three very active pieces, against Black's passive undeveloped position, and he'll have trouble castling because if he tries Bg7, then I have a tactic: Bxe6! Black thought his only chance was to greedily take my pawn, hoping it would be enough compensation for his weak position, but taking the pawn is actually the fastest way to lose. Remember what I said about wasting a move to take a free pawn.} 18. Rd1 {I activate another piece while making a tactical threat of Rxd4 Qxd4 Qxa8.} Bg7 {Stops my threat, but the deadly pin on the d-file will continue.} 19. Be3 {I could've played Bxe6 here, with a more complicated win, but I thought Be3 wins much faster and easier, because now I'm still threatening to win a piece, and this time Black cannot defend the knight anymore.} O-O {Black has stopped my piece winning threat, because now his queen can defend his knight without leaving the defense of his rook.} 20. Bxd4 {An extremely accurate move. It's the first move in initiating my tactic, now I will win at least a piece.} Bxd4 {Black still thinks he is up a pawn for nothing, but he cannot recover from the pin on the d-file.} 21. Qe4 {Now Black has to swallow his pride and give up his bishop, which is his only chance to stay alive, but his next greedy move gives me a much faster and prettier win.} e5 {Black is determined to hold onto his bishop, and keep his extra pawn, but this is a horrible blunder, because Black has overlooked the weakness of his king's position.} 22. Qxg6+ {Now Black is totally lost. This was why h6 turned out to be a weakening move earlier.} Kh8 23. Qxh6+ Kg8 24. Rd3 {After thinking for almost twenty minutes, Black finally resigned when he saw there was no way he could stop mate without giving up his queen. Black's mistake in this game was not developing and activating his pieces, allowing me to overcome his passive position with an array of tactical threats.}
