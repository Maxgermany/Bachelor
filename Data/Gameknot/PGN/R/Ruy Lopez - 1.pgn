1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 {All this so far is the main line in the Ruy Lopez.} O-O 9. h3 {To allow Nh2 later on.} Bb7 10. d4 Re8 11. Nbd2 {This knight is heading for f1 and then g3. (A common motif for white in the Ruy Lopez.)} Bf8 {Looks a bit strange but a useful strengthening of g7 and h6.} 12. a3 {I don't see the point of this move (unless it is to prevent ...Nb4 if white chooses to play c4).} h6 13. d5 Nb8 {Black is cramped and hopes to open lines on the queenside.} 14. Nh2 {An interesting move. Makes room for the queen and prepares for Ng4.} Nbd7 15. Qf3 Qc8 {Black wants to capture back on c6 with the queen.} 16. Ndf1 c6 17. dxc6 Qxc6 {Now black has more space but white's kingside attack looks scary. (Note the two white bishops ready to make sacrificial captures on f7 and/or h6. And there are the two knights ready to advance.)} 18. Ng4 Re7 {Black defends f7 because soon the king might have to leave g8.} 19. Ng3 d5 20. exd5 Nxd5 21. Nf5 {White intensifies the kingside pressure.} Re6 22. Qg3 Kh8 {Black's king doesn't want to share the g file with the white queen.} 23. Be3 {Finally white connects the rooks.} h5 {Weakens black's position. (Later white will use g5 for the queen.)} 24. Rad1 Nxe3 {Black doesn't play ...hxg4 because of the refutation 25 Bxd5 (forking queen and rook).} 25. Ngxe3 Rg6 26. Qh2 Rf6 27. Bd5 {Harassing the black queen.} Qc8 28. Qg3 g6 29. Qg5 Bg7 {If 29 ...gxf5 30 Bxb7 Qxb7 31 Rxd7 Qxd7 32 Qxf6+, then white has a clear advantage.} 30. Ne7 {Now e7 is un-guarded and the white knight can be powerfully posted there.} Qc7 {The queen has to stay on guard duty of b7.} 31. Ng4 {A dramatic move.} Rf4 {If ...hxg4, then 32 Qh4+ Bh6 33 Qxh6#.} 32. Nh6 Rf8 33. Nxf7+ {White makes the first sacrifice (to weaken g6).} Rf4xf7 34. Nxg6+ Kh7 { } 35. Qxh5+ Bh6 {35 ...Kg8 is no good because of 36 Ne7#.} 36. Bxf7 Rxf7 37. Rxd7 {Another sacrifice (to take away the guard from f8 so the knight can go there).} Rxd7 {Not ...Qxd7,  Nxe5 (forking queen and rook).} 38. Nf8+ Kg7 {Keeping guard of the bishop on h6.} 39. Ne6+ {Royal fork and black resigns.  (Thanks to Chris Depasquale for informed commentary.)}
