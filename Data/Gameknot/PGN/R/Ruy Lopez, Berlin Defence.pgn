1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {The Berlin Defence, one of the most popular - and hard to break down - of the various defences to the Spanish.} 4. d3 {Sometimes White castles, allowing Black to go to an often reached position: 4.O-O Nxe4 5.d4 Nd6 6.Bxc6 dxc6 7.dxe5 Nf5 8.Qxd8 Kxd8 where Black has the two Bishops but can't castle, and it's often not easy for White, despite the exposed position of Black's King. But here White's having none of that and just defends the pawn.} d6 {This means Black must also defend his e-pawn.} 5. c3 {Instead of developing a piece with 5.Nc3, White prepares a central advance.} Bd7 {Now Black can break the pin on the Knight.} 6. O-O {Now the e-pawn is safe, White castles. He's clearly going for a slow build up.} Be7 {I have a rather cramped but solid position, and am ready to castle myself.} 7. Re1 {Adding to the e-pawn's defenders - the d-pawn advance can't be far behind.} O-O {Now I have time to castle. Still quite happy with my defensive set-up.} 8. Ba4 {Rather curiously - to me - White doesn't wait for a6, presumably because, since the Knight is no longer pinned, Black has no reason to try to force away the Bishop. So it goes to h4 of its own accord.} Re8 {Centralising my Rook, and leaving the home spot vacant for the Bishop, should it need to retire there - the dark-squared Bishop often has limited movement in this defence. White does have all the options now - he can go to c2 with the Bishop, since it's not doing much out on the wing; he can play 9.h3 if he wants to prevent a potentially awkward pin on his Knight; even the central push with 9.d4 is feasible, and possible even best.} 9. Nbd2 {But my opponent is a slow build up player, and brings his other Knight across the board to the K-side, via f1 probably. But it's rather laborious.} Bf8 {Perhaps I don't make best use of the tempo, but revealing another defender of my e-pawn means I will soon be ready for a central push myself. Since White hasn't played h3, though, that pin might have been more effective, if I could drive away the Bishop from a4, so as not to leave the Knight pinned. That would take a move or so though.} 10. Nf1 {This Knight often goes to f1 in this opening, headed for g3. Now the dark-squared Bishop is free, and once the light-squared Bishop gets to c2 White will have a couple of potentially dangerous diagonals to play with.} h6 {Reducing the dark-squared Bishop's spaces a little; going back to e7 with my own Bishop to break a pin would be a waste.} 11. Ng3 {And the Knight reaches its spot without any trouble, which is perhaps worrying; my defence is solid, but White has all the options. But playing a 2000+ player usually demands caution!} a6 {Getting ready to drive away the Bishop with 12...b5. Another option would have been the rather counter-intuitive 11...Nb8} 12. h3 {Now White prevents the pin.} b5 {I drive away the Bishop.} 13. Bb3 {Instead of going to c2, where the diagonal is currently blocked, the Bishop sits on a diagonal headed towards the Black King. One of the drawbacks of playing h6 is that, with a Bishop pinning the f-pawn, g6 is undefended.} Na5 {However, It's easy to force the Bishop to go to c2, if White doesn't want to lose it. I never really feel comfortable with this move, even though it allows c5, since the Knight is rather out on a limb.} 14. Bc2 {There he goes to c2.} c5 {And I get to challenge the centre a little more strongly.} 15. d4 {So that, now the central advance has come, I can capture with the c-pawn. Or maybe bring the Knight back into play on c6. But I don't...} Qc8 {Dubious, in retrospect. It's not really time to line up a counter-attack sacrifice against White's h-pawn, and clearly if White plays 16.dxc5 I can't recapture with the Queen because of the horrible pawn fork 17.b4} 16. d5 {In any case, White closes up the centre, which has horrible consequences, really. My dark-squared Bishop is severely confined, and my Knight out on a5 can't get back via c6 any time soon.} Nb7 {It has to go the long way round, and since both e6 and c6 are covered by that pawn it doesn't have too many options. From here on, White slowly increases his space and strength in the game. But I hold on for a while...} 17. Be3 {White gets his final minor piece out. He's not aiming at my c-pawn, which could, I guess, be advanced to block any Q-side pawan advance. But it's not the Q-side that White has in mind.} Nh7 {The start of some very time-consuming piece juggling, all due to allowing that central pawn advance to block the position.} 18. Qd2 {No, White's not interested in the Q-side; he's lining up against my h-pawn - just the plan I had when moving my Queen to c8.} Qd8 {From where it returns home; I'm getting worried about those dark squares around g5.} 19. Rad1 {All my juggling about allows White to build up his forces even more.} Be7 {At least, with the Knight on h7 I can get my Bishop back out to add to the cover of the dark squares. But I've moved three pieces out and back during this game - the Bishop to e7 and back; the Knight out to a4, getting stranded; the Queen to c8 and back. It's no wonder my cramped defence is creaking. But I haven't made any outright errors.} 20. b3 {A sudden switch to the Q-side, and now c4 doesn't look good. However, he's drawn my attention away from my K-side.} Rc8 {Another piece that isn't really going anywhere - that file is not going to get opened up. 20...Ng5 might have helped my defence a little.} 21. c4 {White clearly wants to close up the Q-side.} b4 {I oblige. I have enough to think about on the K-side!} 22. Nf5 {Rather horrible for me.} Bxf5 {A bit of panic, I suspect; this is my better Bishop and I've just exchanged it. I'm hoping that after 23.exf4 Nf6 I have blocked the pawn's advance and also stymied White's attack along the b1-h7 diagonal...} 23. exf5 Nf6 {That Knight never looked comfortable on h7. But it was covering g5, and would have been better posted there.} 24. Qe2 {Once the Knight on f3 has moved, the Queen can join the attack!} Qa5 {A rather hopeful attack on an undefended pawn...} 25. Bb1 Qd8 {Soon rebutted. Not only pointless, but giving White a tempo to switch around his Bishop and Queen...} 26. Qc2 {Which he does. He really needs to shift that pawn on f5 though.} Bf8 {Paralyzed. But are there any good moves?} 27. Qb2 a5 {Just in case White has plans to open up the Q-side.} 28. Nd2 {Getting ready to go to e4 attacking my Knight.} Qd7 {I shuffle my pieces in an ever-decreasing space. Maybe I should think about opening up the Q-side myself with 28...a5?} 29. Ne4 {Here it comes.} Be7 {Never again will I limit this Bishop so badly in this opening. But I have to protect the Knight.} 30. Qc1 {So White switches his attention back to that h-pawn.} Kh7 {Ensuring that any sacrifice doesn't open up my King's defence too badly is all I can think of at this point.} 31. f4 {Possibly not the best continuation?} exf4 32. Bxf4 {White has opened up a file, but I can relieve the pressure with some exchanges - } Nxe4 33. Rxe4 Bf6 {Once again the f-pawn is prevented from advancing.} 34. Re6 {Now White has a nasty plan, to give up the Rook for the Bishop, and open my King's defence. Curiously, this doesn't really occur to me; I'm expecting a build up of force on my d-pawn. And the f-pawn is undefended. So I commit my first real blunder...} Kg8 {Defending that f-pawn and getting out of the line of the light-squared Bishop. Analyses differ on the best move, one being 34...h5 - presumably to avoid capture, the others being 34...Qd8 or 34...Qc7, expecting a Rook exchange on e8. But that's not White's plan at all..} 35. Rxf6 {He gives up the Rook for the Bishop and h-pawn.} gxf6 {Major blunder, which probably seals my fate. There really was no need for this - after 35...Qe7 36.Re6 fxe6 I'm a little better placed, though I guess I'd just have lost more slowly against the advancing pawns.} 36. Bxh6 {There's no escape for my King now.} Kh7 37. Qf4 Qe7 38. Qh4 {The game is up - I'm just hoping for an error that allows some counterplay, since e3 and the Rook on d1 are undefended.} Qe2 {There's a mate in seven now, if anyone can see it?} 39. Rf1 {39. Bg5+ Kg8 40. Bxf6 Qxd1+ 41. Kh2 Qg1+ 42. Kxg1 Re1+ 43. Kh2 Rh1+ 44. Kxh1 Kf8 45. Qh8# but it doesn't matter.} Reh8 {So that when I move my King after the discovered check the Queen is attacked.} 40. Qxf6 {The end is close.} Rhg8 {At least I get a mate threat of my own!} 41. g4 {Now, it did occur to me that giving up the Rook for the pawn gave me a little time, but the White King just escapes - 41...Rxg4 42.hxg4 Qxg4+ 43.Kf2 Qd4+ to a lost endgame.} Rce8 {So I cover the escape route and hope there's a tempo to play 42...Rxg4} 42. Qxf7+ {I didn't think of this, thinking I could just take the Bishop.} Kxh6 {And did, so it's mate in three...} 43. Qh5+ Kg7 44. Qg6+ {Mate next move wherever I go, and I resigned. I think the crucial error was Qc8, allowing White to close up the centre - note my Knight is still stuck on b7, having had its return square c6 covered by the pawn. After that it was a lot of squirming but no escape!}
