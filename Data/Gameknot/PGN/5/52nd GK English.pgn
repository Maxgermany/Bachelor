[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 {An English played in the first round of the most recent GK tournament. Black nets an exchange but White manages to cook up some dangerous positions while down in material until the advantage proves too much. } Nf6 {If you're ever going to play me and want to piss me off, play the English. Positional play is the hardest for me, I much prefer sharp tactical lines which are harder to find in this opening if your opponent doesn't want you to. That being said I believe that I have a winning record against the English...} 2. g3 {Aiming for early control of d5 with Bg2} c6 {Contesting that control and supporting d7-d5} 3. Bg2 d5 4. Nf3 {The battle lines are drawn...or are they? } dxc4 {This move gives 33%/33%/32% in the world for White/Black/Draw. White wanted to play the English but so far I've managed to steer the game in a direction I like, open with more tactics at play than positional moves.} 5. Na3 {A weak square for a knight...} b5 {what else? } 6. Ne5 Nd5 7. e4 {And here we come out of the database. White tries to gain space and harass the knight, but the knight was never planning on staying long at d5 and e4 restricts the bishops scope as well. } Nb4 8. O-O f6 {?? With the idea of pushing the knight off of e5 and preparing a possible e5 push to lock the White bishop's diagonal down. However a huuge blunder in light of 9.Qh5+ !} 9. Nexc4 {An interesting sacrifice, the knight was not trapped, can White garner an advantage? } bxc4 10. Nxc4 Ba6 {Black needs to develop and take control of the center if he's going to survive an assault. } 11. Ne3 {?? Simply a blunder I believe, missing the pin on the rook. } Bxf1 12. Kxf1 {? Maybe this deserves a question mark, maybe not. Why not capture with the bishop or queen and take control of the diagonal which Black will have a hard time contesting. } Qd3+ {Develops the queen, takes control of the center, gains tempo, all around a good move. } 13. Kg1 e5 {Trying to prohibit White's bishop and free Black's.} 14. Nf5 {This move poses no immediate danger to Black, but I decide that the outpost is too aggressive. } g6 15. Ne3 {More tempo lost...} Bc5 {Aiming for a possible trade and clearing house to castle. } 16. a3 Nb4a6 17. b4 Bxe3 {I've no qualms in giving White the bishop pair when I'm up a rook and his LSB is severely restricted. } 18. fxe3 Nc7 {Looking to bring the knight to e6, then possibly g5. } 19. Qf3 O-O {Here begins the danger as White tries to throw the noose around Black's semi-exposed king. } 20. Bf1 {A good move, repositioning and activating the Bishop while gaining tempo by pushing the queen around. } Qc2 21. d4 exd4 22. exd4 Ne6 {Threatening d4 and generally looking to control center squares. I thought about Nd7 first but decided on this instead. } 23. Bh6 Nxd4 24. Qg4 {Not wanting to yield e2 or f3. } Re8 25. e5 fxe5 {I spent time here, worried that this opened my king too much, but after looking for a successful line for White I could not find one and thus took. } 26. Rc1 Qf5 {A queen trade can only help me now. } 27. Bc4+ Kh8 28. Qd1 Nd7 {Finally this knight joins the party, and not a moment too late. } 29. Bd3 e4 30. Bc4 Nf3+ 31. Kg2 Nde5 32. Qd6 Rad8 33. Qc7 Rd7 34. Qa5 {Now the Queen has been given a much less active post and black can use his material advantage to bring home the win. } Ng5 35. Bxg5 Qxg5 {White's attack seems to have evaporated and now he has a problem to solve, his rook is being threatened, where to put it? c2 gives black an exchange opportunity and attack, both of which White wants to avoid. b1 and a1 are far too passive and allow black to launch an attack, indeed every square seems fraught with peril.} 36. Rf1 {White seems to be controlling the open file with his rook, but in actuality he is trapping his king...} Rd2+ 37. Kh1 Nf3 {! The only defense from 38... Rh2# is 38. Rxf3 Qxa5 39. bxa5 exf3 and the game is clearly over. }
