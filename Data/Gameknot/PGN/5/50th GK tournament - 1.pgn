Bd2 Bxc3 7. Bxc3 {i lose a knight for a bishop that i could have developed later on} a5 8. Nd2 b5 9. a3 a4 {black is still pawn pushing with all his pieces in the back rank} 10. Be2 g6 11. f4 h5 {black is still pawn pushing?} 12. h4 Nh6 13. b3 axb3 14. Nxb3 Qe7 15. Qd3 {i don't know what i was thinking but looking back this was a horrable move} Ba6 {why not Rxa3 leading to a little lead and me playing catch up} 16. Qd2 {a wasted move on my part} Bb7 17. Bb4 {i try to get some up-tempo action going} Qd7 18. Nc5 {moving my first piece to his side of the board while all of his are behind the 5 rank} Qc7 {why not qe7, or qf7?} 19. Nxe6 {i take advantage of his poor choice in moves} Qb6 {a wasted move by black as the pawn is protected and his queen will soon be moved} 20. Bd6 Na6 21.
