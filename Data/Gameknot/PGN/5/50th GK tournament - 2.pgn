1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 Bd6 {setting up to castle maybe?} 4. e4 {i take full advatage of the situation and take the center board} h6 {why not c6, d4, e7, f8?} 5. e5 {so i move up meaning he lost a major piece for a pawn} Bxe5 6. dxe5 Nd5 {not a bad move, however it puts 2 pawns on the d file with no protection for d5} 7. Nxd5 exd5 {knight for knight} 8. Qxd5 {and i take the unprotected pawn moving my queen up higher on the board} O-O {now he castles} 9. Bd3 Qe7 10.
