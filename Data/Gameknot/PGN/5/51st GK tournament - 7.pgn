[Opening "Anderssen's opening (A00)"]

1. a3 {This game features an unusual opening, an exciting middlegame, and tantalizing missed opportunity on both sides... all in all, one of my favorite games so far from the recent tournament!  I start out with e4 most of the time, but I knew my tournament opponents would likely be well-versed in the standard openings.  So I dusted off an old favorite... 1. a3?!, Anderssen's opening, after a grandmaster famous for his wild and brilliant play (he was involved in both "The Immortal Game" and "The Evergreen Game", two of the most famous games in history.)} e5 {I'd like to think Black was a bit confused by my choice of opening, but he stuck to his plan and staked a claim for the center.} 2. c4 {My idea here was to get into a kind of reverse Sicilian, and possibly start expanding on the queenside with an eventual b4.} Nf6 3. d3 {Fighting for control of e4.} Bc5 {(?!) Black points at f2.  I'm not worried about Ng4?, since I still have e3! in reserve.  Also, I can now play b4 at any time to gain a tempo.} 4. Nc3 O-O 5. Nf3 {Continuing with development.} h6 {(?) I guess he didn't want me to play Bg5.  But Black has neglected his defenses...} 6. Nxe5 {I see no reason not to snap up Black's e-pawn.} Re8 7. Nf3 {I felt that the gain of a pawn was worth the loss in tempo, since Black hardly appears to be in a position to take advantage.} d6 {More to the point would have been .. d5, opening the position and increasing pressure on my uncastled king.} 8. b4 {Now the bishop will be driven back into the corner, allowing me to continue my development and expansion on the queenside.} Bb6 {Forced.} 9. e3 a6 {An escape hatch for the bishop.} 10. Be2 Nc6 11. d4 {I opted to expand before castling, to prevent Ne5 and prepare an eventual .. d5  or .. c5.} Ne7 12. Bb2 {My king is still not in danger, so I finish my minor piece development.} Ba7 {This move is meant to discourage me from playing c5, although .. c4 would serve a similar purpose.} 13. O-O b5 {(?)  This seems like a mistake, as it allows me to win a second pawn.} 14. cxb5 axb5 15. Bxb5 Bd7 {(?!) And now an exchange?  Okay...} 16. Bxd7 Qxd7 {Note the connected pawns on the a and b-files.  If we wind up in an endgame, those kids are going to wind up being very powerful.} 17. e4 {Increasing my control of the center.  I plan to follow up with .. d5 to further restrict Black's queenside.} Rac8 18. d5 c5 {Hmmm, Black is starting to show signs of life!  If I play bxc5, I lose my connected pawns and Black's bishop returns to life.  And if I play dxc5 e.p., Black either regains pressure on the center with a knight capture, or loads up the c-file with a queen capture.} 19. b5 {"Keep hitten'em in the ribs, ya see?  Don't let that bastard breathe!"  Sound advice in both boxing and chess-- when you have the advantage in a closed position, it's generally best to keep it closed.} Ng6 {A more active square than e7.} 20. Re1 {With the knight no longer on the e-file, I need another defender for my e-pawn.} c4 {(!?) This move makes me uneasy.  There's no major threat now, but Black's DSB is now back in the game, and d3 can now be commandeered by a Black piece.} 21. h3 {(??) This move didn't turn out well to begin with, and if the game had gone a bit differently, it might have caused me to lose.  I wanted to prevent the invasion of the knight on f6...} Nf4 {(!) ... but it turns out I should have been worried about the one on g6.  Now there's nothing I can do to prevent that knight from planting himself on d3.} 22. a4 {Since there's nothing I can do about the knight, I put some work into my long-term plan of advancing the passed pawns.  This also frees up my knight on c3 to aid in my defense.} Nd3 {As expected.} 23. Re2 {Black has several options now.  I expected him to immediately exchange the knight with .. Nxb2, which wins a pawn after 24. Rxb2 Nxe4 25. Nxe4 Rxe4.  I would then pretty much be forced to play Bc3 (to block the advancing c-pawn), allowing Black time to double his rooks on the e-file.  However, I could then follow up with 28. b6!, taking the DSB out of play.  But Black's best option is to hold off on any exchanges for now... the knight on d3 is powerful, and in hindsight, .. Nh5! is crushing, since the knight will eventually be brought to f4, bearing down on all the weaknesses in my camp.} Nxf2 {(?!)  This is an exchange that I didn't think Black would consider at all!  R/P for B/N is technically even points-wise, and it DOES win a pawn, but it's also going to make it that much harder for him to handle the connected pawns.} 24. Rxf2 Bxf2+ 25. Kxf2 {Personally, I enjoy the challenge of playing bishop/knight vs. rook.} Nxe4+ 26. Nxe4 Rxe4 27. Bc3 {As stated previously, this move is virtually forced, to prevent Black from playing ..c3!, which would cause havok.} Rce8 {Loaded up like a double-barreled shotgun.} 28. b6 {Again, I'm sort of waiting for Black to commit himself, so I bide my time and continue advancing the twins...} Re4e3 {Reasonable.  My DSB needs a defender.} 29. Qc2 {Black can now force me to give up my queen (and possibly a pawn) for his rooks. Given how the rest of this game has gone, I wouldn't be surprised. It's very rare that I get chance to play an endgame of three lesser pieces versus the queen, so I'm sort of hoping that he might.    Another possibility is 29... Rd3, with the follow-up of Re8e3, doubling the rooks on the third rank.  During the game, I had considered that Black might make that move, and after a bit of OTB analysis, I came up with a "bait" response of 30. Bxg7?!  The idea is that after ... Kxg7, I can play Qxc4, attacking the rook. Black can meet the threat with 31... R8e3, but then I can force a queen exchange with Qg4 !, or continue advancing the pawns with a5.  Material is now even where White has two pawns for the Exchange, but with those pawns being connected and passing (and with Black's back rank undefended), I'd be feeling pretty good about my chances... } Qb7 {Attacking both the b-pawn and the d-pawn.  I can't save them both... but can you see my solution?} 30. Bd4 {Black can still do the exchange of two rooks for queen and pawn via Re2 .  I would have the best chances in the endgame with my connected passed pawns, but I imagine Black could deliver enough spite checks that my task would not be easy.  Another possibility is Re5; if I play Qxc4, Black replies with Qxb6!, and my pawn prospects are far less formidable.} Qxd5 {(??) ... he didn't see the threat.} 31. Bxe3 {And Black resigned.  A shame to end the game on that note, but it happens to the best of us (including me in a concurrent tournament game!)  I hope you all enjoyed this annotation, and I welcome your feedback and input!}
