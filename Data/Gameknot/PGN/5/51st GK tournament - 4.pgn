1. d4 {I always open with d4.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 {A transposition into the queen's pawn game.} 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Bg5 O-O 6. e3 c5 {Here, a pin on my king is countered with my own pin on his queen, note the two pinned knights.} 7. cxd5 Nxd5 {That was unexpected. The obvious choice would be to recapture with the e pawn. I had no idea what my opponent was planning at this point. For one thing, he was going for my c3 knight. But I didn't think he would ever regain the material from the lost queen.} 8. Bxd8 Nxc3 {The expected course of action. The bishop will recapture the pawn after I recapture, forking the king and rook, and then my opponent will go ahead and take it.} 9. bxc3 Bxc3+ 10. Nd2 {I do not want to block the exit way of my bishop with Kf2. Unfortunately, the knight becomes a liability in its current position, as you will see later.} Rxd8 {Another unexpected course of action. My opponent seemed more intent on pinning the queen rather than winning the rook exchange.} 11. Rc1 {...So I save the rook and counter threaten his bishop. I also try to take advantage of the potential hole in the c file.} cxd4 12. exd4 Bxd4 {My opponent has successfully removed my central pawn blockade and has now posed a reasonable threat (Bxf2+) if I should ever move my knight.} 13. Bb5 Nc6 {By playing Bb5 I had hoped to hinder the development of the black knight, maybe prompt an exchange of bishops. If my opponent had played a6, I would have countered with Qa4. After Bxf2+, Kxf2, Rxd2+, Ke3, my queen would have a better shot at the 8th rank for the win. If, then, he played Rd8, my rooks would be easier to develop. My opponent, however, exchanges the knight to take advantage of the open position with his two bishops.} 14. Bxc6 bxc6 15. O-O {I trade off, since trading away pieces is good when ahead on material. I decide to castle instead of taking the pawn, since the latter could lead to Bb7, which skewers my rook and gives away my g pawn.} Ba6 {If I had not castled by the time my opponent played this move, I would not have been able to do so without losing my rook.} 16. Re1 {The only way to save my rook.} Bb6 {Now my opponent pins my knight and moves his bishop to a safer position. Now it will be tricky to get my queen out of the pin and at the same time protect my knight.} 17. Qc2 Ba5 {My knight is pinned yet again, while simultaneously being attacked by two pieces.} 18. Rcd1 {Red1 would have led to Be2, causing me to undo the move and consequently lose my knight.} Rab8 {My opponent mounts another threat by seizing the open file. It would have been possible to fork that a rook with his light square bishop if his other rook left the 8th rank for whatever reason.} 19. Re3 {I release the pin. I also contemplated Re5, but that would only cause problems after Bd3. I hope to send the rook later to b3 to defend against the black rook on b8.} Bb6 20. Rb3 Rd5 {My opponent's most likely intention is to double up the rooks, but this move actually buys me a little time.} 21. Nf3 {I had believed the time was right to move my knight. I opt to exchange the rooks, taking material off the board. I had decided that Bc4 wasn't much of a threat.} Rbd8 22. Rxd5 exd5 {I had thought that the point of doubling up the rooks was to always keep a rook controlling the open d file, which was why I had anticipated Rxd5 instead. I questioned why he put his rook on d8 in the first place. I suppose he thought that it would have been better to un-isolate his c pawn, which are now both passed pawns.} 23. g3 g6 {I try use this time to ensure the safety of my king. In a normal situation, h3 is better since it doesn't weaken the light squares, but there is still the possibility of Bc7.} 24. Qxc6 {Here is a gutsy move. I had already known that my opponent would immediately play Rc8, followed by 25.Qf6 (must protect f3; Qxd5 will lead to a royal fork with 27. ...Bc4+), then Rc1+ 26.Kg2, Bf1+ 27. Kh1, Bh3+ 28.Ng1. I have, however, a better plan up my sleeve. It is true that the pair of black bishops in combination with the two paired passed pawns backed by the rook could, potentially, overwhelm me. I planned to exchange rook for a bishop and pawn by taking on b6, having him recapture, and taking the pawn with my queen. At least then, I thought, my queen would have more influence and his pawns and king would be weaker. As you will see, although this did not lead to my defeat, the plan backfired. I set a long chain of conditional moves at this point, of course, to speed up the game.} Rc8 25. Rxb6 axb6 26. Qxb6 Rc1+ 27. Kg2 Bf1+ 28. Kh1 Be2+ {It was this move that really caught me off guard, and it was also the extent of my conditional move list. I had not really given much thought to this move, instead expecting Bh3. The mistake of Qxc3 had ruined the outcome of the game for me. Now I am pulled into a forced draw by threefold repetition, since Ng1 would lead to Bf3#.} 29. Kg2 {I again set another chain of conditional moves, which explains the repetition. A draw is inevitable.} Bf1+ 30. Kh1 Be2+ 31. Kg2 Bf1+ 32. Kh1 Be2+ 33. Kg2 Bf1+ 34. Kh1 Be2+ {At this point I had to declare a draw. The lesson? Do not become cocky when ahead in material; avoid especially those mistakes that change the end result.  Thanks for viewing!
