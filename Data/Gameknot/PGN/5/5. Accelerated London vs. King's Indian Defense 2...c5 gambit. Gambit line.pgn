1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 {Accelerated London system. Resembling the Colle System, white develops the Bishop to Bc1-f4 the hallmark of the London. The orthodox move order has always been on the 3rd move, e.g., 1. d4 2. Nf3 3. Bf4 to what ever Black plays. The Accelerated London develops the bishop on move 2. I'm not a Londoner so I'm not going to write the pros and cons of The orthodox London vs the accelerated London system and how it is meant to deal with Black's moves. I just know it's really in vogue right now and a hot opening for White because Magnus Carlsen has played it. I will add black will face a blunted King's Indian Defense if both sides were to develop their own system, i.e., The london system vs the King's Indian Defense. For example, 1. d4...Nf6 2. Nf3...g6 3. Bf4...Bg7 4. e3...d6 5. Be2..0-0 6. 0-0.} c5 3. e3 Nd5 4. Ne2 {!? what a quirky response! White doesn't want to waste time moving a piece twice in the opening and instead pushes forward with development.  } Nxf4 {The reason behind Black's third move otherwise why would black play Nd5??? If black doesn't play this then he's playing the opening terrible!} 5. exf4 {?} g6 {King's Indian formation. } 6. dxc5 Qa5+ 7. Nbc3 Qxc5 8. a3 Bg7 9. Rb1 {!? getting out of the line site of the g7-bishop. } O-O 10. Qd5 Na6 11. Qxc5 Nxc5 12. g3 b6 13. Bg2 Bb7 {Black's rooks are now connected. } 14. Bxb7 Nxb7 15. O-O {White's rooks are connected.  Now the middle game has begun. } Rfc8 16. Rfd1 d6 17. Nd4 Rc5 18. Nce2 Rac8 {The rooks are doubled up on an open file. } 19. c3 a6 {Black begins the queenside attack or minority attack. } 20. Nb3 Rc5c4 21. Nd2 Rc4c6 22. Nf3 b5 23. Ned4 Rc6c7 24. f5 {!? A sound plan. White finds a to get ride of his double pawns. } Rc7c5 25. fxg6 hxg6 26. Rde1 e5 {Gameknot's engine considers this to be an Inaccuracy but I disagree. } 27. Nb3 Rd5 {Black invades!} 28. Rbd1 Rxd1 29. Rxd1 Bf8 30. Nfd2 a5 31. Nf3 b4 32. cxb4 axb4 33. axb4 Rc4 34. Nfd2 Rxb4 35. Rc1 d5 {! So to all you Londoners out there remember that Black will eventually move his pawns forward in the late middle game never in the opening when Black plays the King's Indian. The Black army pushes forward to invade White's domain.  } 36. Rc2 Kg7 {The King marches forward with his army. } 37. Nf3 {? mistake number 1?} Rxb3 38. Nxe5 Bd6 39. Nc6 Rb6 40. Nd4 Be5 41. Rd2 {? mistake number 2? } Bxd4 42. Rxd4 Rb5 {You can say this is the Endgame. } 43. f4 Kf6 {The king marches forward. The black king has moved twice and White's king has moved zero.  Black is winning at +5.48 by engine analysis. } 44. b4 Ke6 45. Kf2 Nd8 {31 moves later and I finally move my Knight! I thought this was marvelous to leave a knight so stationary. } 46. Ke3 Nc6 47. Rd1 Rxb4 48. Rc1 Rb3+ 49. Kf2 Kd6 50. Rc2 f5 51. Ra2 d4 52. h3 Rc3 {and here I was drained out of ideas. My thoughts were white does have some counter play by bringing in the rook on my back rank and could possibly try to promote his h-pawn at some time.   Gameknot's computer engine analysis states I'm winning at  +10.61 which equates to a knockout win for black. I was very stumped though and wanted to throw the towel in}
