1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 {The Queen's Indian defence. Usually, this ends up in equalized games, very well analyzed. In this game with Black, I tried to fight for the initiative with a new move.} Ne4 {A new move! Why should Black not move the Knight into the center, with a delayed d5. White must take care because the plan 7. Bg2 followed by 8. 0-0 is countered by Black with 9. .. f5.  Other possibilities were 5. .. d5 or 5 .. Bb4, but both alternatives are known and have been discussed recently (e.g. http://www.chesspublishing.com/content/10/index.htm#qui) } 6. a3 Be7 {Black prepares castling.} 7. Bg2 {And so is White.} d5 8. O-O O-O 9. Bb2 {Required move if White plans Nc3 - The black Knight on e4 is looking for quick exchange.} f5 {! The center is under Black's control, but White is going for a Knight combination. No less than five Knight moves follow.} 10. Ne5 Nd7 11. Nc6 Qe8 12. Nc3 Ndf6 13. Nxe7+ Qxe7 14. Nxe4 Nxe4 {After the Knight exchange combination, White has a small advantage for now. } 15. Rc1 Rad8 16. f3 Nf6 17. c5 {! This was surprising for Black. With Qd2 and Re1 White is back in the fight for the center.} f4 18. Qd2 fxg3 {Black is attacking on the King side. The pawn opens the f file.} 19. hxg3 Nh5 20. Kh2 {Forced. 20. g4? Nf4!} Rf6 {The plan is doubling the rooks on the f file and a discovered attack with check on the h file.} 21. Qg5 Qf7 22. Bh3 Re8 {This move prepare e5.} 23. Rc2 bxc5 24. dxc5 {A discovered attack of Bb2 at the rook Rf6!} e5 25. Bg4 {g6 is not possible because of Qh6. Black is going for Queen exchange.} Rg6 26. Bxh5 Rxg5 27. Bxf7+ Kxf7 28. Rd2 Kg6 {28. .. d4 was also possible. White could only go for a draw with  29.f4 Rf5 30.Kg1 exf4 31.Bxd4 Rxe2 32.Rxe2 Bxe2 33.Rxf4 Rxf4 34.gxf4} 29. Rxd5 Bxe2 30. Re1 Bxf3 31. Rdxe5 Rgxe5 32. Bxe5 {After this combination, it is rather clear that the game is drawn. Black will exchange rooks.} Kf5 33. Bc3 Rxe1 34. Bxe1 c6 35. Bc3 g5 36. Kg1 h5 37. b4 Bd5 38. Kh2 Kg4 {Bishops on different colors are not always reason enough to draw a game, but here, the pawns are blocked, and White can handle the end game, even if the position is slightly worse than Black's.   So, is the new move 5. .. Ne4 a better alternative to Queen's indian defence classical lines, or is Black's position not getting strong enough for some advantage over White? }
