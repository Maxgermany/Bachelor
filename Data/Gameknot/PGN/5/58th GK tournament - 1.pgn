[Opening "Richter-Veresov attack (D01)"]

1. d4 {This game illustrates how strong a Queen can be. Sometimes it can even outplay two Rooks and a Bishop! But more of that later.} d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bg5 Nbd7 {The main line in the Richter Veresov Attack. Black protects himself from the doubling of Pawns (after Bxf6), but at the same time Bishop on c8 is trapped for a while.} 4. Qd3 {White wants to play the thematic e4 as quickly as possible to gain space in the center.} e6 5. e4 dxe4 6. Nxe4 Be7 7. Nxf6+ Bxf6 8. Bxf6 Nxf6 9. Nf3 O-O 10. Be2 {The position is roughly equal, but now Black attacks the center with another thematic move.} c5 11. O-O cxd4 12. Rfd1 Re8 {A good move. Now, if 13. Qxd4, Qxd4 14. Rxd4, e5 then Black can be happy.} 13. Ne5 Qc7 14. Qxd4 Qxc2 {Black grabs the free Pawn on c2, but White grabs the initiative!} 15. Bb5 Rf8 16. Rac1 {All the White pieces have reached active positions, while the Black Rooks and the Bishop are out of play. In other words: The lost Pawn was worth the investment.} Qe4 {Swapping Queens, please?} 17. Qd6 {No thanks!} a6 18. Nc6 {Worth an exclamation mark, I think - and a very picturesque position with two White pieces en prise. 18. -, bxc6 is not desirable because of 19. Bxc6 which pins both Queen and Rook. If Black chooses to take the Bishop instead, then follows: 19. Ne7+, Kh8 20. Ng6+, hxg6 21. Qxf8+, Kh7 22. Rxc8, Rxc8 23. Qxc8 with a solid advantage for White.} g6 {But now the Black Queen is trapped!} 19. Rd4 Qxd4 {If the Queen moves to the "only" square f5, then the fork after Ne7+ would decide the game.} 20. Qxd4 axb5 21. Ne7+ Kg7 22. f4 {Giving the White King some air, and threatening g4-g5 winning the pinned Black Knight.} h5 23. Rc7 Re8 {This turns out to be a bad idea. The Rook should have kept protecting the f7 Pawn, but Black is very cramped. Now comes a surprising sacrifice, denting the Black Kingside completely.} 24. Nxg6 Kxg6 25. Qe5 {The "silent move". They can be hard to find, when you are attacking, but the threat of 26. Qg5+ winning back the Knight is very unpleasant for Black.} Nd7 {Cutting the Rook on c7 off from attacking the Pawn on f7, and threatening the Queen at the same time.} 26. f5+ Kh7 {The critical moment of the game. Of course 26. -, exf5 27. Qxe8 was hopeless, but now White has no more checks, and his Queen is still under fire from the Knight. It took me a long time of analysis to find the only solution: Another sacrifice!} 27. Rxd7 Bxd7 28. f6 {Another !. Black has a winning material advantage (even two Rooks vs. Queen is generally better), but White has created a mating net.} Kh6 29. Qf4+ Kg6 30. h4 Kh7 31. Qg5 {Black can choose between 31. -, Rg8 32. Qxh5 mate or 31. Any move -, Qg7 mate - but he chose to resign instead. One of my best games on Gameknot, and I would like to thank my opponent for the good fight.}
