[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), Chigorin variation"]

1. d4 {This short game is an example of the classic Bishop sacrifice on h7.} d5 2. Nc3 {An invitation to the Richter Veresov attack, which is not played very much these days on the high levels.} e6 {Invitation declined! Black wants a French setup.} 3. e4 Bb4 4. e5 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 a6 {Not a good move. I would suggest an idea like 5. - b6 followed by Ba6 to exchange the "bad" French Bishop. Now it is buried behind his own pawns. 5. - Ne7 right away could also be played.} 6. Nf3 Ne7 7. Bd3 O-O {And this is simply suicide with the Knight on e7 instead of f6 ...} 8. Bxh7+ {Of course!} Kxh7 9. Ng5+ Kg6 {The King has to go forward, or else the White Queen goes to h5 with a quick conclusion.} 10. h4 f6 {This simply looses the Queen, so the less evil would be 10. - Qe8, but then White has a strong attack, and Black will loose material to parry it. One possibility is a Queen check on d3 followed by Qg3.} 11. h5+ Kh6 {Only move. 11. Kf5 leads to mate in one (Qf3++).} 12. Nf7+ {The "fork" which costs the Black Queen, and 2 light pieces is not enough compensation. White still has a tremendous attack, and the Black queen-side of the board is totally undeveloped. Black resigned.}
