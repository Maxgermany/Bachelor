1. c4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. e3 Nf6 4. Be2 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 6. b3 Nc6 7. Bb2 {The game started as a english opening but this takes the game in a differnet direction.} Bf5 8. Nc3 Qd7 9. h3 {g4 is threatened.} Rad8 {The threat of g4 is ignored.} 10. Bd3 {10g4 is worthy of coinsideration.} Bxd3 11. Qxd3 e5 {The first proper blow?} 12. Ng5 exd4 13. Nce4 {This is an attempt to create play along the long diagonal.} Nxe4 14. Nxe4 dxe3 15. fxe3 {A terrible oversight that loses a piece. the bishop is hanging / loose on b2.} Bxb2 16. Rb1 Bg7 17. O-O Rde8 18. Rbd1 Qe6 19. Ng5 Qxe3+ 20. Qxe3 Rxe3 21. Rfe1 Rfe8 22. Kf2 Re3xe1 23. Rxe1 Rxe1 24. Kxe1 {The smoke has cleared and black has two pieces to whites one. White should try to keep the piece on.  The win gets easier with one pieceagainst none as opposed to two pieces against one.} Nb4 25. a4 h6 26. Nf3 Kf8 27. Kd2 Ke7 28. Ne1 f5 29. Nd3 {Equivalent to resignation.  Black has a piece advantage as well as a pawn majority on both wings.} Nxd3 30. Kxd3 Ke6 31. Ke3 c6 32. g4 d5 33. gxf5+ gxf5 {The result of blacks majority on both wings is visible- black has two passed pawns. The win was probably trivial even with the piece on due to the pawn majority on both wings but exchanging the last piece cannot be recommended in these circumstances.}
