[Opening "French (C02), advance, Nimzovich system"]

1. e4 {My first anotated game} e6 {I like playing the french a lot, i have very good results with it.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The advanced variation. Against this particular variation i like playing against, i think that black has very good play by putting pressure in the center with c5, Nc3, Ne7-f5, Qb6, and so on,  having an equilibriated game and a very good initiative.} c5 {The typical french pawn structure} 4. Nf3 {The literature recommends here to play c3, defending directly d4 with a pawn, making a more solid structure.} Nc6 {Adding some more pressure to d4} 5. Be3 {?! Inaccuracy. I think c3 was better. Be3 doesn´t defend d4 well.} Nge7 {With the intention of playing Nf4 adding more pressure on d4 and threatening Nxe3} 6. Nc3 {?! Again, c3 was better. His center is going to fall soon.} Nf5 7. Nb5 {?? I can´t figure out what was the plan of the guy at that moment. That move is bad because the knight has to go back after a6. He had to develop his pieces instead.} a6 8. Nd6+ {??} Bxd6 {Solving the check} 9. exd6 Qxd6 {The guy lost a pawn but i don´t know why. Maybe because he was trying to relieve the pressure on the center, and then equalizing by 10. dxc5, thinking that i couldn´t take the pawn because it was protected by the bishop. But instead he will be punished.} 10. dxc5 Nxe3 {Removing the defender.} 11. fxe3 {Another line is 11. cxd6 Nxd1 12. Rxd1 Kd7, the black pawn structure is pretty stable and the white passed pawn is hopeless. } Qxc5 {Winning the pawn} 12. Qd2 {With the intention of castle long} e5 {Controlling the center, and preparing the white squared bishop to enter the action.} 13. Be2 {Developing. Here i was doubting if he was castling short or long.} O-O {Safeguarding the King} 14. O-O-O {? I Think castling short was a better option, because of the potential threats Bf5, Rc8 and Nb4 pressuring c2} Bf5 {Bringing the bishop into combat. There it controls the h7-b1 diagonal and pinning the pawn, looking for a further combination.  } 15. a3 {? Bad plan. He maybe wanted to control the b4 square preventing the knight jump and later to do b5 to expel the queen. Be he wasn´t paying attention to the multiple threats coming.} Rac8 {Putting more pressure on the column and preparing Na6-b3 with a double check} 16. g4 Na5 {Threatening the double check  Nb3+ that would be unstoppable because of the double pin on the pawn, losing the queen} 17. Qc3 {? I think this is bad. I don´t know what he was thinking. If he wanted an exchange of queens, White King will be totally exposed after the exchange, and will lose another pawn. But here i saw something else. I thought for a very long time. I saw a combination but i wasn´t pretty sure about what was going to happen. Finally i decided to do it...} Qxe3+ {! the next combination is forced.} 18. Qxe3 {Forced. If 18. Kb1 Rxc3} Rxc2+ 19. Kb1 {Only legal move} Rxe2+ {And here i recover the queen.} 20. Qd3 {I had a problem of calculation here, i was expecting 20.gxf5 Rxe3 with 3 pawns of advantage and threatening the Knight. Instead i will have only 2 pawns of advantage, but it´s also pretty good.} Bxd3+ 21. Rxd3 e4 {Fork! Here i accepted the trade of Knights because i was going to have a very strong passed pawn in exchange.} 22. Rxd5 exf3 23. Rxa5 Rfe8 24. Rc1 f2 25. Rf5 g6 26. Rf3 Re8e3 {And he resigned here, because the pawn is almost unstoppable. }
