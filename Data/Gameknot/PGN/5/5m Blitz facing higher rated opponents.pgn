1. e4 {hey hey all who like following the annotated section.  i wanted to post this one because its a nice show of aggression vs higher rated opponents that can be really effective,} e5 {this game was a 5m blitz so there was alot less time to think. it was also a test to see if i can remember my lines and not using the analyse function.   i guess a test to see if im actually learning lol} 2. Bc4 {and so i stick with what im comfortable with the bishops opening} Nc6 {hmm not nf6 so i will decide to not aim for a d4 with a reply like nc3, and play d3  to get f4 in.} 3. d3 Nf6 {alright there is the nf6 but its ok experience serves i do not need to fear the d5 anymore} 4. f4 {and so i can get it my f4} d5 {here comes the d5 usually id panic and be like damnit i got to start dancing my bishop. but now i stay calm and play properly} 5. Bb5 {so i pin the knight to possibly invite a6 then play Ba4 to invite b5 and weaken the queen side pawn structure incase he wanted to queen side castle or i may also decide to double pawn him if the board looks good for it, also this seems more time efficient than going straight to b3.} d4 {he decides to do an advance} 6. fxe5 {i reply with pawn take to undermine his middle and now there is an opening for my DSB plus he cannot recapture this pawn and there is no current threat to my LSB,} Nd7 {retreats centrally to attack the e5 pawn} 7. Nf3 {so i decide to develop and temporarily protect that pawn, he will be able to atleast take something down with him now when he dies. so pawn up! lets keep this up} Bc5 {i found this reply to be really passive. protecting an isolated pawn. who can only be reconnected to a line with a pawn whos now behind 2 minor pieces. thought it was also pretty much putting his DSB to sleep for a few turns as  i had no intention of nxd4 yet id rather keep a high pawn even if he is doubled} 8. Bxc6 {and so after that passive bishop move i decide to double pawn him start picking up a pace} bxc6 9. O-O {immediate castle.} Qe7 {i guess this was to attack my e pawn but hes only a temporary post and i guess his focus on this pawn i use as time gainers} 10. Bg5 {and so i decide to attack the queen. and ill get a pawn for that pawn. as i had atleast planned he would take 1 more material with his death} f6 {natural reply.} 11. exf6 gxf6 12. Bf4 {he recaptures now he has an isolated pawn and some double pawns and im eyeing a hanging pawn because he moved his queen,  this blitz is going well for someone whos almost 200 elo above me  i think i didnt once play as he planned i would.} h5 {i guess he was pretty cramped or he wanted to start coming down for a checkmate since i castled and the board is open above my king} 13. Bxc7 {so im able to grab that pawn immediately. and my bishop can sit there for a few turns near his king i thought this to be wise} Qg7 {and i had seen him starting to get ready to come for my king, since his LSB is behind his knight i only need to do 1 move} 14. Nh4 {this will prevent the pawn from advancing and my opponent cannot checkmate with just queen and rook. so its a good time gain defense} Rg8 {stacks his rook. but thats 1 tempo i gained cause i got ready for it last turn} 15. Qxh5+ {and so i grab the new hanging pawn and gain time. i doubt he will offer queen exchange on f7} Kf8 16. Nd2 {wanted to connect my rooks and bring my last piece to life didnt want to rush the attack since i dont get to analyse and i didnt want to make mistakes.} Nb6 {oops the pressure of blitz. my opponent was under 2 minutes left i had a comfortable 4:30 left i had played pretty fast this game, i guess having repeatedly played the same opening over and over you start seeing when the opponent isnt replying optimaly.} 17. Qxc5+ {hanging bishop with a time gain my opponent is pretty much in trouble now} Kf7 {at this stage i thought a while i could see he would dive his bishop to h3 and all i have to do is play Rff2 and i will have enough cover over the g square for all 3 of his pieces. i think his crumbling empire has lost the strenght to deal the finishing blow} 18. Qxc6 {so i decide to grab more material and get it wide open in front of his king to prepare a checkmate} Bh3 {anticipated reply} 19. Rf2 {keeping your head cool defense} Rac8 {attacks the bishop. but i need not panic. if he takes with rook its a check recapture so obviously its a bad trade off. } 20. Nc4 {and so i decide to attack his last knight to ease the defense around his king} Nxc4 {down 7 and still exchanges material my opponent ran out of answers i think. maybe na8 had more appeal applying double pressure to my DSB and i cannot move it} 21. Qxc4+ {no need to break my pawn line i can recapture with a check} Be6 {here i cannot take the pawn or he takes my bishop so i stay on that file} 22. Qc5 {but still with the threat of capturing the pawn and covering the f5 square i had already planned to stack my rooks and i just need to push up on the king} Qg4 {hmm this move froze me a few moments. and i judged that im up 7 so ill let him take the knight with the queen and he will not have the time to replace his queen in front of his rook to mate me.} 23. Raf1 {and so i stack my rooks} f5 {hmm unanticpated reply. but this one i liked i could now defend my knight and block his bishop} 24. Nxf5 {i think my opponent was playing too aggressive at the detriment of his safety.   we see the importance of not moving pawns on your castle side.} Bxf5 {swaps out his LSB didnt understand. i saw this as him giving up his queen  or im pretty sure i will checkmate him} 25. Rf2xf5+ {this is where i thought he would give up his queen to try to survive if not i dont know how he thought he would get to play again having 2 rooks queen and DSB around his king with nothing to block their paths} Ke6 {decided to try to dance. } 26. Qe5+ {start getting my units all together in a fashion so he cannot recapture or block any checks} Kd7 27. Rf5f7+ {only 1 possible way to go} Kc6 {and the end is coming} 28. Rf1f6+ {a 3 line wall eyeing down on his king only 1 spot left} Kb7 29. Qd5# {and the king ran out of space.   i hope you enjoyed this game. im happy i can perform under pressure against higher rated opponents. all comments appreciated}
