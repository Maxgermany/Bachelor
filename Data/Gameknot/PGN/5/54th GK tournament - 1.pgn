1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Bd3 Bxd3 5. Qxd3 e6 6. Nf3 Ne7 7. Bg5 Qb6 8. b3 Nd7 9. O-O Ng6 10. Nh4 {10. I was surprised at Nh4.  B is cramped and the exchange of knights makes his game easier.  White should continue to develop to be able to exert potential pressure, so Nd2 or Nc3 presents more problems for B.} Nxh4 11. Bxh4 c5 12. Nd2 cxd4 13. Nf3 Rc8 14. Rfc1 Bb4 15. a3 {15. B's B is nicely located while W's is "offside", i.e. out of the action. } Bc3 {12. See previous note.  W's loss of tempo is good for B. Allowing B to capture c5 takes d4 is a mistake, as B can get some counterplay before W can recover the pawn.} 16. Ra2 Qc7 {16. } 17. Nxd4 Qxe5 {17... B is definitely better, and probably winning here.  B is a pawn up w/ central pawn majority.  W cannot exploit B's  undeveloped K-side until he unscrambles his own Q-side.  } 18. Nb5 Nc5 {18....Nc5 should lose. On 19. Bg3, B has Qg5 hitting the loose R, and then after W's move, Be5 to guard the diagonal, and the threatened fork on d6.  But I think B is lost after 19. Q x c3, Q x c3 19. N x c3, N x b3, then a rook move to break the pin.  B can either capture the N, or move his own, now threatened N.  Either way, he ends up losing a piece for 2 pawns.  W's dark-squared B is very strong, almost as strong as B's rooks, and B should prevail without much difficulty.  19.Qe3 ends all of these complications, and B is just better. } 19. Qe3 {19. Returning the favor.  See previous note.} Qxe3 20. fxe3 Ne4 {After 20....Ne4, B is winning.  If W trades his N for a B, W's entrenched, and unmoveable N on e4, is as strong, and probably, stronger than W's dark-squared B.} 21. b4 {21. N x a6 allows, ...Bd2 then after the R move, B x e3  skewers the N. If the rook doesn't move, then after 21. N x c8, B x c8, say Kf1,...B takes e3 looks like B is trapping the N.} a6 22. Nxc3 {22. N x c3 loses an exchange, as B threatens the R's--directly on a2, and w/ the fork threat on e2.} Nxc3 23. Rca1 Nxa2 24. Rxa2 Rc3 25. Kf2 Kd7 {25... B will unite the rooks, W's e pawn is weak, and he is minus a pawn to boot.  B should win without difficulty.} 26. Bg3 Rhc8 27. Be5 f6 {27..."dizziness from success".  Allowing W to get back into it.  I had looked at R takes c2 , trading the W rook, and preserving the pawn advantage, and then forgot(!) to make the move.} 28. Bxc3 Rxc3 {28...Karpov, I think, would win this without difficulty. Besides the pawn advantage, B's K is better placed, and W has 3 "pawn islands" which will be difficult to defend. } 29. Ke2 Kd6 30.
