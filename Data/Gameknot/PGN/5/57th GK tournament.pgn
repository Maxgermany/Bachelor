1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 {I've been trying to find a line that i like.  I've not had too much luck in general with any queen pawns's games as black.  As white, i generally fair pretty well, but something about this line has for some reason confused me and i'm 0-4 as white from here and 0-3 as black from here as well.  I'll probably create a mini tournament at some point starting from here to try to address that.  This is known as the benoni defence (A65). } 3. Nc3 {? Already moving into unfamiliar territory.   D5 is the main line, which prevents for now the exchange of pawns.  This line is poor for white because black can develop with tempo after the pawn exchange.} cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nc6 {At this point, because of the weak 3rd move, black has probably already overcome white's initial advantage.} 5. Qd1 g6 {Extra tempo and no real attack yet from white allows me to fiachetto my kingside bishop} 6. b3 {White decides to fight for control of the long dark squared diagonal} Bg7 7. Bb2 Ne4 {?? Complete waste of 2 moves from the knight.   Allows white to develop Q with tempo and threaten to trade off the darksquared bishop i just developed. Castling or moving a pawn out of the way of the light squared bishop is clearly better.} 8. Qc2 Nf6 9. e3 d6 10. Bd3 {White is setting up to aim at my king side.  } O-O 11. Nge2 {While this location may seem like a good place for the knight, as it is out of the way or the pawns and supporting a kingside pawn advance, this move allows black to force a trade of a knight for whites well positioned and supported lsb.} Ne5 12. Ng3 Nxd3+ 13. Qxd3 b6 {Not wanting to develop my bishop to a position where i will have to retreat it if white starts a pawn advance.} 14. Nce4 Nxe4 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 16. Qxe4 {I'm already behind in development and now with that series of exchanges, white threatens my rook and has taken control with his queen of the diagonal i opened for my lsb} Be6 {No really great moves for black here.  This is a poor place for the lsb as it gets in the way of black's central pawns.  Ba6 or Bd7 are probably better though.} 17. O-O Qd7 18. h3 Bf5 {?? For some reason i decide that breaking my pawn structure is worth exchanging my bishop for white's knight to do.} 19. Nxf5+ gxf5 {If Queen recaptures i lose a pawn and isolate my D pawn.} 20. Qf3 Qe6 21. Rfe1 Qe4 22. Qf4 Qxf4 23. exf4 Kf6 24. Re3 Rad8 25. Rae1 e6 26. Rd1 h5 27. h4 Rfg8 28. Red3 Ke7 29. b4 Rg4 30. g3 Rgg8 31. Ra3 Rd7 {I really should have played Ra8, but i was hoping to play that the next move to save tempo.} 32. c5 bxc5 33. bxc5 dxc5 34. Rxd7+ Kxd7 35. Rxa7+ Kd6 36. Kf1 {Black's only saving grace is his centralized king, which he wastes allowing white to basically move at will.} Rf8 37. Ke2 Kc6 38. Kd3 Kb6 39. Rd7 Kc6 40. Ra7 Kb6 41. Re7 Kb5 42. Kc3 Kb6 43. Kc4 Kc6 44. a3 Kb6 45. a4 Kc6 46. a5 Kd6 {Ra8 would probably have been better here.} 47. Rb7 Kc6 48. Rb6+ Kc7 49. Kxc5 Ra8 50. a6 Ra7 51. Rb7+ Rxb7 52. axb7 Kxb7 {White can reach black's pawns and begin picking them off at will.} 53. Kd6 Kc8 54. Ke7 Kc7 55. Kxf7 Kd6 56. Kf6 Kd7 57. Kg5 Ke7 58. Kxh5 Kf6 {Game is over at this point but i decide to fight on. } 59. f3 Kg7 60. Kg5 Kf7 61. g4 fxg4 62. fxg4 Kg7 63. h5 Kf7 64. h6 Kg8 65. Kf6 Kh7 66. g5 Kg8 67. Kxe6 Kh7 68. f5 Kg8 69. f6 Kf8 70. h7 Ke8 71. h8=R# {Any tips on where i started to go wrong would be appreciated :P Thanks :) And thanks Dandy for the game.}
