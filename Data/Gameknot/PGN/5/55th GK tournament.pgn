1. e4 {Quite an interesting game from the tournament I most recently participated in, ending in my first victory against a 1700+ rated player. In this game I had the Black pieces.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 {Four Knights Opening (so named for fairly obvious reasons). This tends to lead to fairly quiet play.} 4. Bb5 {The most common move at higher levels. Beginners often play 4. Bc4 but this can be answered by 4... Nxe4! leading to a good position for Black.} Nd4 {This is Rubinstein's Variation, more aggressive than the symmetrical 4... Bb4. Note that White cannot win a pawn by 5. Nxe5 as Black regains it after 5... Qe7.} 5. Bc4 {Less common than 5. Ba4 or 5. Nxd4. Note that 5... Nxe4 is less good now with e5 undefended; one possible continuation is the wild 6. Bxf7+ Kxf7 7. Nxe5+ and now watch what happens if Black gets too greedy: 7... Ke6 8. Nxe4 Kxe5 9. Qh5+ Kxe4 10. d3#!!} Bc5 {Trying to head back into quieter waters. Black is a tempo up after White's Bb5-c4.} 6. d3 {The database gives 6. Nxe5 as the most common here; this leads to 6... Qe7 7. Nxf7 Rf8 8. Ng5 d5 9. Be2 dxe4 with an unclear position.} d6 7. h3 {A sensible precaution to stop Bg4, which would be very good for Black with the knight on d4.} O-O 8. Be3 c6 {The database gives this as the first unique move; 8... Nxf3+ was played in raedwald vs. ronaldwilson (0-1 in only 16 moves, but White blundered allowing a knight fork, so the win does not say much about 8... Nxf3+ in particular). I suppose I was just consolidating my centre, but it turns out to be a mistake, since...} 9. Bxd4 Bxd4 10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Ne2 c5 {...I have to advance the pawn again, losing a tempo. Even if I didn't want to play 8... Nxf3+, I could have spent my eighth move on a developing move such as Bd7 or Be6.} 12. c3 {White decides to exchange one of my doubled pawns. On paper that sounds like a good deal, but it's likely to be followed by a further exchange on d4, leaving my d6 pawn isolated and vulnerable. Still, I have no choice but to accept.} dxc3 13. bxc3 a6 {Preparing to support the advance of the pawns to b5 and c4. If White responds with d4, the d-file remains blocked.} 14. a4 Be6 {Challenging one defender of b5 and also opening the line for my queen to guard the rook, so that if White exchanges bishops I can play 16... b5 without the a-pawn being pinned.} 15. Qb3 Qd7 {We both defend our bishops, each waiting to see who's going to exchange first.} 16. Bxe6 fxe6 17. O-O b5 {White exchanged. It's time to advance, and see if I can get something out of my queenside majority.} 18. axb5 axb5 19. g3 {Preparing to advance on the side where White has the majority, I assume.} Kh8 {This move, unpinning the e6 pawn, is necessary before I can advance further.} 20. Nf4 d5 21. exd5 exd5 22. Rab1 {White challenges my inadequately defended b5 pawn. The response is obvious.} Rfb8 23. Kh2 {Freeing the knight from having to defend the h3 pawn.} b4 24. c4 {If instead 24. cxb4 I was planning to take with the rook. At some point very close to this – I don't remember exactly which move – I offered a draw, having accidentally timed out two games (my first ever) that meant I couldn't progress in the tournament, and wanting to limit the damage. I thought the position was fairly drawish, too, with material level and White's active pieces consistently limiting my plans, but White decided to play on.} dxc4 25. Qxc4 {I had expected 25. dxc4, getting White's pawn off a file my heavy pieces can use. Of course, it would also block the file for White to attack my d-pawn, and perhaps White felt that was more important.} Rbc8 26. Rfe1 {The rook has no obvious targets on the e-file. Perhaps 26. Rfc1 was better.} Ra3 27. Rb3 Rxb3 {I see nothing better than exchanging, since the rook cannot stay put, and no other rank offers an active position. The draw offer has changed the game psychologically, since I feel White's most likely reasoning for declining was that he felt he could win, and that automatically puts me on the defensive. I know that my position looks fairly good, with the passed pawn, but the downside is that my pawn majority is under constant threat while White's is still quietly at home.} 28. Qxb3 Qd4 29. Kg2 Re8 {My turn to offer an exchange: again with the motivation being whittling down whatever chances White may have of converting this into a win.} 30. Rxe8+ Nxe8 31. Qf7 {A dangerous move, since it threatens immediate checkmate. For a moment I wondered if 29... Re8 had been a blunder.} Nf6 {Black does, however, have this defence. Now 32. Qf8 is not mate because of Ng8. If White plays 32. Nh5 to threaten mate on g7, either 32... Qd7 or 32... Qd5+ defends, the latter also forcing the exchange of queens.} 32. Ne6 {This move instead combines the threat on g7 with attacking c5. In addition, Qd5+ no longer forces the exchange of queens. Black must therefore use his other defence:} Qd7 33. Qf8+ Ng8 34. Nxc5 {And now White is up a pawn.} Qd5+ {A good counterattacking response. Black threatens to make something of his passed pawn, and White's queen is temporarily immobilised through having to defend the knight.} 35. Kg1 b3 36. Nxb3 {White decides to sacrifice knight for pawn. I don't know if this was necessary, since 36. Na4 Qxd3 (Qb7 37. Qa3) 37. Qb8 seems adequate to keep the pawn in check. Black would at least have regained the lost pawn, with a draw looking likely.} Qxb3 37. Qd8 {Obvious; White must hold onto his own passed pawn to retain winning chances.} h6 {And Black must mobilise the knight.} 38. d4 Kh7 39. Qh4 {White can't continue pushing the pawn: 39. d5 Nf6 40. d6 Qd1+ 41. Kg2 Ne4 42. d7 Nf6. I'm not sure what White's specific plan was with the move played; perhaps trying to get his queen behind the pawn.} Nf6 40. Qf4 Qd3 {But Black can occupy the d-file first. White had no way of preventing this.} 41. Kg2 Qe4+ {In hindsight, I think this was a blunder. I wanted the queens off so my king could play a more active role, but I could and should have played 41... Kg6 first since White has no immediate good checks. Exchanging with White's king closer to the centre than mine is too risky, since the lone knight is not the best piece at defending against passed pawns.} 42. Qxe4+ Nxe4 43. f4 {And here White returns the favour; 43. Kf3 might even win. I've looked at a couple of lines and it seems Black will have to give the knight for the pawn, for instance 43. Kf3 Nd6 44. Kf4 Kg6 45. Ke5 Nc4+ 46. Ke6.} Kg6 44. Kf3 {Now it's less good, both because Black's king is better-placed to hold White's back, and because White's own f-pawn takes up a vital square. Black must, however, be careful not to fall into the trap of 44... Kf5?? 45. g4+.} Nf6 45. g4 Kf7 46. h4 {White isn't just marking time; he's preparing to knock my knight so his king can reach e4.} Ke6 47. g5 hxg5 48. hxg5 Ng8 {(!) But this defence turns the tables.} 49. Ke4 Ne7 {Zugzwang. No White pawn can advance, and any king move allows Kd5.} 50. g6 {White's best shot. Of course there's a trap, 50... Nxg6?? 51. f5+, but more to the point is that taking with the king gives White time to advance the pawn further.} Kf6 51. d5 Kxg6 52. Ke5 {Not best; 52. d6 would have set Black more problems, but 52... Nc6 53. Kd5 Nd8 is adequate to stop the pawn. After the move played...} Nxd5 {...Black can just gobble the pawn, simplifying to a winning pawn endgame.} 53. f5+ {If 53. Kxd5 then 53... Kf5 and the pawn cannot be saved.} Kg5 54. Kxd5 Kxf5 55. Kd4 Kf4 {This is the simplest winning procedure: White's king is kept away from the g-file.} 56. Kd3 Kf3 57. Kd2 Kf2 58. Kd3 {Now White wonders if Black will repeat the position.} g5 {No; White's king can come to the g-file now, the pawn will cross the last danger square (g4) before White's king can challenge it there.} 59. Ke4 g4 60. Kf4 g3 61. Kg4 g2 {White resigned. Mendez is now the highest-rated player I have won against, but he also beat me in our other game in the same tournament.}
