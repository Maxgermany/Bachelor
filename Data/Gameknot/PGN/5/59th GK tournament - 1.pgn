1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 b6 {black chooses to play his pawn. Why noty his Knight to e7? rRule 1: play your knights first. Rule 2: Be careful about making pawn moves, especially at the bebginning of the game. This pawn move would latyer on in the game put Black King in a dangerous position.} 5. a3 Bf8 {Bishop going back to f1, Black loses tempo. Black should have prepared to castle on that side instead. Bishop needed to take the Knight} 6. Nf3 Qd7 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. O-O Bb7 9. Qe2 O-O-O {is this a good move?} 10. Ba6 {I think White is a bit too quick to start an attack here. } Nh6 {Knight to h6!! I think Black knight needed to be on e7. } 11. Bg5 Be7 12. Bxb7+ Kxb7 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. b4 {Pawn to b4. At last!} Nf5 15. Rfd1 h5 16. Na4 {Black didn't see the check here, or he just ignored the threat. Ka8 would have been a better move.} g5 17. Nc5+ bxc5 {why not Ka8?!} 18. Qb5+ Kc8 19. Qxc6 {Black lost a knight. Not looking good for black....} c4 20. Qa8+ Kd7 21. Qxa7 g4 {Good move but Rook to a8 would be a far dangerous threat} 22. Qa4+ Kc8 23. Ne1 h4 24. Qa6+ Kd7 {white needs to keep the pressure on.... }
