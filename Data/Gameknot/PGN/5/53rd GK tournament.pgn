1. Nf3 {A quick game in a GK tounament where my opponent made some poor choices and I made the most of them. I liked it because of the many attacking options/moves I could have played and guessing the defensive plays black could use once I was behind enemy lines. I have never studied any chess books so I am not up with chess lingo so I'll keep it simple. Hope you like...} c5 2. c4 Nc6 {Already a fairly rare opening. No idea what its called...} 3. Nc3 Nd4 {Don't want to exchange as I would be forced to then move my knight on the c file.} 4. e3 {Better for development} Nxf3+ 5. Qxf3 f6 {The door is opened, not a good move} 6. Bd3 {Getting ready....} e5 {Obviously not aware of my plan and a poor opening. The only piece developed by black has been exchanged.} 7. Qh5+ {Moving g-pawn to defend would be lose material as bishop would take and h-pawn, if it took the bishop, would give up the rook.} Ke7 8. Be4 {I thought I needed to get the front 2 black pawns out of the way so looking to move d2 to d4} d6 {Seen by black so I go for plan B...} 9. Nd5+ Kd7 {e6 would have been mate} 10. Qf7+ {Always satisfying to get queen in there causing panic} Ne7 {Moving the bishop in the way I could then have taken g7 followed by the rook. If black had moved king to c6 it would be nicely in line with white bishop} 11. b4 {I want the pawn out of the way so i can advance c-pawn and get black d-pawn away from its king. This opens up the possibility of moving the queen to check on the d file and also whites black bishop onto the a file in another threatening diagonal. } b6 {Black defends but now I see something else, and its not that I can capture material with my knight (white bishop would then have a clean run at the rook)} 12. b5 {Black king now has nowhere to go, surronded by checked squares. } Rb8 {Preventing my knight from captuing material but not seeing the real problem although not sure there was much that could be done now} 13. Bf5# {Game over, and with all but two pieces left on the board. I welcome all comments as I remember while playing there were lots of things going through my mind. I have not annotated them all as its a while since the game and I can't remember them all. Thanks to my opponent who's a good player but on this occasion just got it wrong.}
