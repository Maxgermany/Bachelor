1. e4 {Rook sacrificed for pawn advancement!   I'm playing white and perhaps played one of my better games here.} e6 2. Nc3 a6 3. b3 {I normally don't open backside like this, but since he's yet to place any threat in the middle I figure why not. } h6 4. d4 b6 5. Bb2 {I don't quite understand why he's letting me have the center of the board.} Bb7 6. Bd3 Nf6 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. O-O g5 9. Re1 {I like this move a lot, I use it quite frequently to get the kings rook more envolved in the middle of the board.  I will wait against some players to see if he castles, I figure this guy is pretty good so i will go ahead and bring him out.} g4 10. e5 gxf3 11. exf6 fxg2 {I'm not sure why he decided to take g2 before qxf6.  } 12. d5 {ahh....the useful e1 rook} Nd4 13. Ne4 Bc5 14. d6 Rc8 15. Qg4 {My ferocious pawns are beginning to burden my opponent.  lol} Bxe4 16. Bxe4 Qxf6 17. Bb7 {ok, now he has a problem. } Rb8 18. c3 Nc2 {he goes ahead and moves here figuring to take 1 rook and my bishop} 19. Re2 {I let him take a1, while guarding f2  and potentially losing both rooks} Nxa1 20. dxc7 {now his rook is in a bind} Rd8 21. c4 {I wait to take, seeing something even more magneficent.  Queen/rook diagonal is in need of some help  HAHA} Qg6 22. Qxg6 {take obviously, he'll have to take mine and I get both his rooks} fxg6 23. Bxh8 {BOOM!} Ke7 24. Bf6+ {the funs not over sucker, come away from the rook } Kxf6 25. cxd8=Q+ {Now it's all over but the crying...} Kf5 26. Bxg2 {get rid of that nasty booger} g5 27. Be4+ Kg4 28. Qf6 Nxb3 29. Qf3+ Kh4 30. Qg3+ Kh5 31. Qh3# {Good game mate!}
