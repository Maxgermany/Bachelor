1. d4 e5 {not the most textbook opening...} 2. dxe5 {she takes my pawn putting 2 of her own on the e file} h6 3. Bf4 g5 {trying to move her bishop back some with this move} 4. Be3 Nc6 5. Qd5 {she pushes her queen out...} Nge7 {so i start to try to form some of my pieces and push her's away from the center board} 6. Qe4 d6 7. exd6 Qxd6 {i decide to get my queen active instead of cxd6} 8. Nf3 {she still has alot of pieces on her 1 rank} Bf5 {I know have alot of pieces out and am trying to push more of hers back} 9. Bc5 {trying for a queen for queen...} Qd7 {I opted out seeing an easy mate, she should see it as well} 10. Qc4 O-O-O {this was the best move i could think of, it leaves a piece unprotected and since she is not paying attention to the board...} 11. Qxf7 {she takes my pawn} Qd1# {Checkmate :) first annoted game, hope you enjoy White's folly}
