1. e4 e5 2. d4 {Again with the centre game. Keeps my options open; the only pieces I am unable to move on my next move are rooks.} exd4 3. Qxd4 {Keeping with the centre game. My queen comes out to complete the pawn trade to gain some tempo...} c5 4. Qe3 {...but loses a little thanks to the QBP, which is now protected by the bishop. Still, she sits nicely on the 3rd rank...} Nf6 {...and my opponent gets level on development with his knight...} 5. Nf3 {...so I develop my own knight on the kingside to get back ahead on development...} g6 {...and he moves up the pawn that started in front of his developed knight, no doubt hoping to fianchetto his bishop...} 6. Nc3 {...so I bring out my other knight onto the long dark diagonal...} b6 {...and he moves up the other knight's pawn, again possibly to fianchetto his other bishop...} 7. Nb5 {...but I don't know why I moved my knight up there, other than to set up a fork on c7...} Ba6 {...and as the bishop attacks the knight, meaning that if I remove my piece, I could lose my bishop...} 8. b3 {...I move up its pawn, hoping to fianchetto my own bishop...} Bxb5 9. Bxb5 {...and we trade my knight for his bishop, leaving my bishop reasonably placed...} Bg7 {...and he finally fianchettos his bishop...} 10. h3 {...but why did I move up my kingside rook's pawn, when 10... Ng4 would lose a horizontal/vertical piece?} O-O {He obviously didn't see my mistake, castling kingside...} 11. O-O {...and I give him another chance by also castling kingside...} a6 {...and he attacks my bishop with his pawn...} 12. Bd3 {...forcing it to retreat to the only safe place...} d6 {...but yet again he fails to spot the opportunity to win my queen/rook...} 13. Rb1 {...so I finally see the danger and move my rook out of harm's way...} Nc6 {...and he develops his other knight, no doubt hoping to threaten my pieces...} 14. Bb2 {...so I fianchetto my bishop onto the long dark diagonal to contest it, should he move his f6-knight away...} Nh5 15. Bxg7 Nxg7 {...and that is exactly what happens, so we trade bishops. I'm a little surprised that the knight captured mine, as it loses tempo.} 16. e5 {I now move up my king's pawn to attack my opponent's queen's pawn, and hopefully gain some tempo by a pair of exchanges...} dxe5 17. Nxe5 {...and I get the pawn exchange, using my knight, as my opponent's controls the square mine is on...} Nxe5 18. Qxe5 {...and I get the knight exchange, and the queen gains the tempo she was hoping for, sitting in the middle of the board...} Re8 19. Qc3 {...but she must move out of the way, after coming under attack from the rook...} Qc7 20. Rfe1 {...and with both of mine connected, I contest the open e-file, hoping to seize control of it...} Rxe1+ 21. Rxe1 {...and I use my rook to complete the exchange, so my queen doesn't lose any tempo. And of course, I have control of the open file.} b5 {The pawns are coming at me, thick and fast. The knight's pawn advances, no doubt hoping to threaten my queen...} 22. b4 {...so I block one with mine, attacking the bishop's pawn...} c4 {...but it stays on its file, attacking my bishop...} 23. Bf1 {...so I drop it back to its base...} a5 {...and the rook's pawn attacks my knight's pawn...} 24. a3 {...so I bring my rook's pawn forwards to give my knight's pawn extra cover...} a4 {...but my opponent's rook's pawn also stays on its file, also being covered by the knight's pawn, in a chevron formation...} 25. Qe5 {...so I attack my opponent's queen with mine, covered by her rook, hoping to commit my rook forwards, as the QNP is also under attack, threatening to create a passed pawn on b4...} Qxe5 26. Rxe5 {...and I get the queen exchange, committing my rook forwards, onto the 5th rank, again threatening the b5-pawn, to make my b4-pawn passed...} Rb8 {...so my opponent covers with the rook...} 27. g4 {...and I move my KNP forwards, so my bishop can move onto g2, in order to reach c6, so I can get my passed pawn, and maybe even a second on a3...} Ne8 28. Bg2 {...and I now get my bishop onto the long light diagonal, the first part of my plan. In order for this to be a fianchetto, does this have to be its first move?} Nf6 {Although the knight is looking to threaten my rook (by moving to d7, g4 is a no-go, as my h3-pawn covers that square), my bishop can easily cover that square...} 29. Bc6 {...and I do the second part of my bishop plan, giving me a passed pawn on b4, as I have more control of the b5 square: my rook and bishop v my opponent's rook.} h5 30. gxh5 Nxh5 {I deem it worth trading pawns, as I'm about to be ahead by one...} 31. Rxb5 {...and I capture the pawn on b5, isolating the ones on a4 and c4, and giving myself a passed pawn on b4...} Rxb5 32. Bxb5 {...and I also get the rook exchange, going into the endgame where no piece is worth more than three points. I think this was very dubious by my opponent, as I am ahead on material, and I'm about to get a second passed pawn...} c3 33. Bxa4 {...which is exactly what I get, doubling my advantage.} Nf4 34. Kh2 Ne6 35. Kg3 Kg7 36. b5 {After wasting two moves with my king, I finally get my furthest pawn forward moving...} Nc5 37. b6 Nxa4 38. b7 Nb2 39. b8=Q {...and although I lose my bishop, my pawn is unstoppable, and I claim my queen...} Nc4 40. a4 {...and I advance my other passed pawn forward, hoping for a second...} Na3 41. Qe5+ {...but I move my new queen back, to fork the king and c3-pawn...} f6 42. Qxc3 {...and remove the latter, giving another passed pawn, threatening the knight...} Nb1 43. Qc7+ {...which forces her back up to check again...} Kh6 44. a5 {...and my opponent resigns, knowing that there's no way back.}
