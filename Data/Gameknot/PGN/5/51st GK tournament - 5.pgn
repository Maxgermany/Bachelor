1. e4 c5 {Book opening: Sicilian defense...} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {I like to go after the center early, so I usually will end up pushing both e4 and d4; although I open myself up, most players don't capitalize on this opportunity} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O {I figure my pieces are well developed for the most part, So now I'll castle. (Plus the rook will solidify my hold on the center.} e5 9. Nf3 Bg4 {Classical mechanism. Easily prevented by h3(?!) but chose not to risk opening up my king} 10. Be2 O-O 11. Bxf6 {Things are pretty stale, I figure I'd better get some action going before one of us is bored to death. Plus, I weaken the power of the bishop on g4.} Bxf6 12. Nd5 {I'm just making myself out to be the aggressor here, and make him risk his king's position; Also delaying pawn to d5 push.} Nc6 13. Nxf6+ {Probably could have delayed this, but chose not to. It works out eventually} Qxf6 14. Nd2 {I want him to take the bishop (keep the action going, and show that I don't have to be the aggressor for the entire game). The knight adds protection to e4 pawn.} Bxe2 15. Qxe2 Nd4 {Saw this coming, but not worried} 16. Qd1 b5 17. Nb3 {I'm purposely taking the risk of losing the e4 pawn to allow me to activate a rook. I could have done c3, but I'm a gambler, and I like to have fun as I play this game} Nxb3 18. axb3 Rfe8 19. Rb1 {Just in case he pushes d5} b4 {Now I switch from being the aggressor to the strategist.} 20. c3 bxc3 21. bxc3 a5 22. Re1 {refortify the center just in case of a counter-strike.} Reb8 {interesting decision; trying to step up as the aggressor, let's see where this leads...} 23. Re3 Rb7 24. Rd3 {We are trying to catch one another off guard by switching roles.} Rd7 25. c4 Ra6 26. b4 {? (maybe not the best idea...)} a4 27. b5 Ra5 28. Qc1 Qd8 29. b6 Rc5 30. b7 {I'm not really trying to get a 2nd queen, I'm just trying to create an open lane for the rook} Qb8 31. Ra3 {...and get this 'problem' taken care of,,,} Rxb7 32. Rxb7 Qxb7 33. Rxa4 h6 {possibly a wasted move? Unless he thought i would sacrifice my queen to back-rank him.} 34. Qc2 d5 {?:hmm...probably not wise to push this now...} 35. exd5 {!!The better choice as Black's king is still blocked in} Qxd5 {! interesting. Wonder if considering a rook trade?} 36. Rb4 {Don't wanna lose a pawn in this tight game, but has bigger things in mind...} Qd4 {?? The big mistake. Qd8 would prevent the next move and still save the queen!} 37. Rb8+ {A well played game by both parties. 1 big mistake for black cost him. It's a shame such a wonderful game came to such a tragic end...}
