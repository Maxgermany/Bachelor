1. e4 {This is my second annotation. This game was interesting and a game I was happy to win. I always like to move my king's pawn two spaces.} c5 {A response move I am not that familiar with, but I had to go on anyway.} 2. Bc4 {I stop the pawn moving by moving Bc4 and also attacking f7.} Nc6 {flyfish283's knight comes into play.} 3. Qf3 {My queen could checkmate on the next move, by moving Qf3.} Nf6 {The attack is blocked with Nf6. I wasn't expecting a win that easy anyway. Not many people win in four moves.} 4. Nh3 {So my knight opens the other way with Nh3.} e5 {flyfish283's pawn advances two spaces to e5.} 5. Ng5 {My knight becomes more attacking, and if the opponent is not careful, they could be down ten points.} Be7 {The bishop comes out, but that doesn't stop me from going Nxf7.} 6. Nxf7 {I am now attacking flyfish283's queen and rook and is being protected by my bishop. flyfish283 obviously moves his queen out of the way allowing me to take the rook.} Qa5 {The queen moves away to a5.} 7. Nxh8 {I take the rook.} Nd4 {Nd4 opens an attack on my queen, so I move it quickly.} 8. Qd1 d5 {The queen's pawn comes down to attack my pawn and bishop.} 9. Bxd5 {I really should have taken it with my pawn, but this is more attacking.} Nxd5 {I get taken, but I take his knight by exd5.} 10. exd5 {Seven points up in a tournament game gives me good self-esteem and motivation to keep going.} Bf5 {Bf5 was a smart move. Why did I castle?} 11. O-O Nxc2 {Nxc2 lost me my rook, so I needed to regain those lost points.} 12. Qh5+ {I put the king in check.} g6 {A good move, blocking the escape of my knight, attacking my queen and defending his bishop at the same time. It wasn't unexpected.} 13. Qxh7 {This however left the pawn to be taken.} O-O-O {Castling I have to say wasn't the best option, but opened up the rook on a8.} 14. Qxe7 {I take the bishop on e7, but my knight is left open.} Rxh8 {My knight is gone, but I am still seven points up.} 15. Qxe5 {I move Qxe5 as a response move and now also attacking his rook.} Nxa1 {So he finally takes my rook. Why did he leave it so late?} 16. Qxh8+ {I take his rook and put flyfish283 into check.} Kd7 {The game is about to close with the king moving to d7.} 17. Nc3 {My knight comes up for no particular reason.} Nc2 {So his knight comes out too.} 18. a3 {Didn't see the end at this point.} Nd4 {The knight comes out to defend any attacks.} 19. Re1 {The game ends very soon with Re1.} Nb5 {The knight moves away, which is a good thing for me.} 20. Qe8+ {I go for the attack.} Kd6 {There was the mistake. If only flyfish283 had move to c7, the game might have lasted longer.} 21. Qe7# {A small subtle movement cost a point on the tournament board. Thank you for watching this annotation. The writing wasn't the best, but I promise it will get better!}
