Ba3 {When making this move I realized the black could eventually play ... c4; for now this threat is hypothetical due to B:c4} Na5 19. Rac1 {I completely forgot about the ... c4 and my opponent promptly reminded me about it :)  The white are losing their bishop...} c4 20. Qg3 Bxa3 21. Rce1 Bf8 22. Qh4 h6 {I don't think this move is good, probably ... f5 would be better} 23. Nf3 Qe7 24. Qg3 Ne3 25. Rf2 Nf5 26. Qh2 {Again, the white are playing without a bishop, however I was able to consolidate 5 pieces on the king's side.} Bd7 27. g4 {This starts a winning attack} Ne3 28. Ng3 Nd5 29. Ne4 {This is a great place for the knight.} Bg7 30. h4 Bxa4 {The black are now a bishop and a pawn up!} 31. h5 {Using the fact that the black can't play g5 now.} Bc6 32. g5 {Destroying black's defense} gxh5 33. gxh6 Bxh6 34. Qxh5 Bg7 35. Nfg5 Kf8 {Too passive. Maybe it was time to give some material back trying to diffuse white's attack.} 36. f5 {Now the white's attack is unstoppable.} exf5 37. Rxf5 Be8 38. Nh7+ Kg8 39. Nef6+ {39... B:f6 would lose even faster:  40.N:f6+ N:f6 41. Rg5+ Kf8 42.Qh8+ with a checkmate to follow. } Nxf6 40. Nxf6+ Bxf6 41. Rxf6 {The game is over.} Qf8 42. Kf2 Qg7 43. Rg1 Qxg1+ 44.

Qhf5# {The black has won a bishop early on but underestimated white's initiative on the king's side.}
