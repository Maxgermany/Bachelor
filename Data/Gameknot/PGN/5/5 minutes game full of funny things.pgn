1. c4 {my usual and favorite} e5 2. g3 {i decided to play something unusual for me: the control of light squares.} Nf6 3. Bg2 c6 4. Nc3 {well, i control, he controls} d5 {we all control} 5. cxd5 cxd5 6. d4 {destructuring the center. I am not sure it is correct, but I secretely hoped to isolate his pawn, even at a cost of a tempo: exd 7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd1.} e4 {but of course no... my plans never work} 7. Bg5 {so now other plan: i have a useless bishop, i still have a good control on light square... i want to destroy these pawns... I had a few moves to make.} Be7 8. e3 Nc6 9. Nge2 {now, my plans were to put my knight on f5, takes his f-knight and capture the center pawns.} Bg4 {... but i had to delay this plan} 10. Qb3 {could even be better} Bxe2 {eliminating one of the potential "taker"} 11. Kxe2 {Haha! I surprised you, buddy! I thought that the only problem my king could have by not catling here was the opposite queen,,, which i had planned to exchange in the next few moves...} Na5 {this is a huge mistake, giving me a tempo} 12. Qb5+ Nc6 13. Bxf6 {accomplishing my plan, delayed for a long time!} Bxf6 14. Qxd5 {now, I want to exchange and take the second pawn, if it is possible.} O-O 15. Qxd8 Rfxd8 16. Nxe4 {two pawns ahead...} Be7 17. Rhc1 Rac8 18. Kf1 {first mistake by me.} Nb4 {of course! I should have played a3 before!} 19. Nc3 Nd3 {i expected that} 20. Rc2 b5 21. Be4 {the plan to pin my horse is a bit slow} Nb4 22. Rd2 {no more pin} a6 {too slow} 23. a3 Nc6 24. Bxc6 {I hate horses when they are my opponent's... :-)} Rxc6 25. Ne4 Rdc8 {doubled: this means although I am 2 pawns ahead, I am defending again...} 26. Kg2 {this is my second huge mistake. Ke2 was of course necessary} Rc6c2 27. Rxc2 Rxc2 {now he is in... but only one rook: no panic} 28. b4 f5 {anyway, I intended to exchange the horse with the bishop} 29. Nc5 Bxc5 {and so it is done.} 30. bxc5 {here I hesitated... and actually it turned to be dangerous. Although the next moves are mostly mistakes, I wonder if, anyway, letting him a majority on a-b side is or not a huge mistake.} Kf7 {logical.} 31. Kf3 {logical} Ke6 {logical} 32. a4 {well, less logical, but I was at a loss of ideas... I should have played h3, then g4... but TIME!!!} b4 {of course!!! now he is the dangerous one!} 33. Rb1 {forced but expecting a5...} Rc4 {And he made THE mistake!!!} 34. a5 {of course! to prevent a5 now!} g5 35. Kg2 {why on earth did I do that??? totally unnecessary... but not too dangerous} h5 36. Rb3 {provonking...} Kd5 37. Kf3 {where i belonged!!!} Ke6 {he may think of a draw, now} 38. h3 {but i don't} Kd5 39. g4 fxg4+ 40. hxg4 h4 {and i create a new threat for myself!!!! } 41. Kg2 Ke4 {could have been worse...} 42. f3+ {expelling the king, but creating a weakness on e3...} Kd5 43. Kh3 Rc3 {and now his Rc3 is a good move.} 44. Rxb4 {ouf... one threat is gone} Rxe3 {but now, i have a new weakness on d4} 45. Kg2 Re2+ {unnecessary, i guess} 46. Kf1 Ra2 {this is more accurate} 47. Rb6 {threatening two moves... but i was expecting Rxd4, because if i take the a6 pawn, he takes my c-pawn, and then my a pawn falls... and he turns better...} Rxa5 {and this is his biggest mistake. Now, I win!} 48. Rd6+ {and that is why!} Kc4 49. c6 {byebye buddy boy} Ra1+ {compensating...} 50. Kg2 Ra2+ {compensating} 51. Kh3 {no more compensation} Ra1 {unnecessary} 52. c7 {hello dolly} Kd3 53. c8=Q {Unless you see something I did not... this is the end...} Ke3 54. Qc3+ Kf4 55. Rf6# {and even d4 plays a role in this mate situation. Thank you brave pawns!}
