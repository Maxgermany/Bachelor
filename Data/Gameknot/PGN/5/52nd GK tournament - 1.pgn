[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {Another quickie... White's first move is perfectly correct of course.} c5 {The Sicilian Defence, my favourite.} 2. Bc4 {A typical Gameknot move, avoiding most of the book lines, but I've developed my own repertoire against it by now.} e6 3. e5 {Unusual even on Gameknot!  The second move of the same pawn doesn't develop any pieces, or increase the scope of any, either.  It does deprive Black's KN of its natural square but it also relinquishes control of f5 and d5.  It's also more difficult to defend than a pawn on e4.} Nc6 {Immediately attacking the intruder.} 4. c3 {Normally a good developing move for White, supporting a subsequent p-d4, and providing an outlet for the Q on the d1-a4 diagonal, this move in this position deprives the Nb1 of its best square and fails to support the pawn on e5.} d5 {I saw no need to take the e5 pawn immediately: development was more important, so I launched the d-pawn forward, attacking White's Bc4, releasing my Bc8 and potentially my Bf8.} 5. exd6 e.p. {White played what appeared to be the most efficient move, swapping pawns so that Black could no longer take on e5, but he helped Black develop even more quickly...} Bxd6 6. Qg4 {Attacking the now-unprotected g7 pawn and setting up pressure on e6 but Black, being better developed, has the resources to respond.} Qf6 {defending both the threatened squares and setting up pressure on f2} 7. d3 {releasing the q-side minor pieces but already inhibited by Black's pressure on d4} Ne5 {Now that g7 is protected, the fork has real bite and White has to beware of unprotecting d3.} 8. Qf4 {?? Whoops.  Black now forks on d3, revealing the attack on the Q from d6, so that even if White takes on d3 he still loses his Q.} Nxd3+ 9. Bxd3 Bxf4 {and White has had enough.  I'm not the only person to fall into opening disasters!}
