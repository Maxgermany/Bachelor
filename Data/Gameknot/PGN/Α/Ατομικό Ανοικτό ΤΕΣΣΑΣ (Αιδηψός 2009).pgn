1. b4 {Polish {or (Alexei) Sokolsky's} Opening} e5 2. Bb2 Bxb4 3. Bxe5 Nf6 4. c3 Ba5 5. e3 c5 {5..., d5 6.Qa4 c6 7.Bf6 gf6 +=. Kreideweiss – Lentschu (Marek's Enc.).   I have seen the line 5...., d6  (6.Bg3 0–0 7.Nf3 =) also} 6. d4 {6.Bd3 Nc6 7.Bg3 0–0 8.Ne2 d5 etc ... 1–0  (17): Szeligowski – Ruddell,  Boulder 1993 (Marek)} Nc6 7. Bxf6 {Preferable 7.Nf3} Qxf6 8. Qf3 {? White loses a pawn  & stays behind in development.} cxd4 9. Qxf6 gxf6 10. exd4 Nxd4 {=/+, -/+} 11. Bd3 {The threat was 11...., Nc2 -+} d5 12. Ne2 Nxe2 13. Kxe2 Bd7 14. c4 {Losing precious time. A little better seems the development  of the Rook h1, either with 14.Rd1  or 14.Re1.} dxc4 15. Bxc4 O-O {With the pair of Bishops  and having their opponent's King in the center of the chessboard,  the Black stands much better.} 16. Rd1 Ba4 17. Rd4 Rfe8+ 18. Kf1 {?? Blindness! Of course White should have played 18.Kf3. In that case Black again would have had the better (almost winning) position,  playing 18..., Re1 or even 18..., Bc6+.} Re1# {}
