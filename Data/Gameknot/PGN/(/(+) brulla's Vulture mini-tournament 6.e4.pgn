1. d4 c5 2. d5 Nf6 3. c4 Ne4 {The characteristic move of the Vulture. It is meant to constrain white's development, especially of the queen side: if Nc3 happens it will be exchanged at once.} 4. Qc2 {The standard answer. } Qa5+ {Also this move is meant to hinder white's development.} 5. Nd2 {Or 5.Nc3 Nxc3 6.Bd2... and then 6...Qxa2?! or 6...Qc7. The first alternative is not sound and only suitable for blitz games.} Nd6 {The characteristic take-back.} 6. e4 {Here we have the first of the two main variants: 6.e4 or 6.b3, accordingly the answering strategies of black differ. } g6 7. e5 {This move is very aggressive. The alternatives are 7.Ngf3, 7.f4, 7.Ne2, 7.b3 and 7.b4} Nf5 8. Bd3 {Or 8.Ngf3, 8.Ne2. The played move forces black to think about his knight.} Nd4 {Attack is the best defense! This gives the black knight a central position.} 9. Qd1 {?! I think 9.Qc3 and pushing the black queen would have been better.} Bg7 10. Ngf3 {This loses a pawn: 10...Nxf3 11.Qxf3 Bxe5} Nxf3+ 11. Qxf3 Bxe5 12. O-O {White has achieved a fast kingside development for the sacrifice of a pawn. Now it is black's task to develop himself into a safe position. 12...0-0  A) 13.Nb3 Qc7 14.h3 (14.Re1 Bxh2  15.Kh1 Be5 16.Qe3 d6 17.Qh6 Bg7 18.Qe3 Re8) d6 15.Bd2 b6 and Bb7  B) 13.Re1 Qc7 14.Qe3 d6 15.Qh6 Bg7 16.Qe3 Re8} O-O 13. Nb3 Qc7 14. Bh6 {Knocking at black castle's backdoor. A) 14...Bg7 offering the exchange. B) 14...Re8 Note that now two pawns are en rpise: h2 and a2. E.g. 15.h3 Bxa2 16.Rb1 Be5 17.Rfe1 d6 looks the better way, going with the bishop and two extra pawns rather than without them. ;)} Re8 15. h4 {And now 15...Bxb2 A) 16.Rae1  A1) 16...Bg7 17.Bg5 d6 // 17.Bf4 d6 // 17.Bxg7 Kxg7 Later: Nd7 aiming for e5. A2) 16...Be5 17.Qe3 d6 18.f4 Bg7 or even Bh8.} Bxb2 16. Qe3 {!?! Wow... let's see how white intends to attack. 16...Bxa1 and then A) 17.h5 d6 18.hxg6 hxg6 19.Qg5 Bf6 -  B) 17.Rxa1 e5 18.Nxc5 d6 19.Ne4 Qe7 20.Bg5 Qf8 21.Nf6 , no very bad  - B1) 17...d6 18.h5 e5 19. Qg5 (19.dxe6 e.p. Rxe6 20.Qg5 Qe7 and most of black's problems are solved; 19.Bg5 Nd7 20.h6 f5 and then?) Qe7 20.Qg3 e4 21.Be2 Bf5 and slowly black develoops his pieces building a fortress around his king. C) 17.Nxa1 d6 18.f4 Bg4 (18...f5 19.g4 not so good) 19.f5 Qd7 20.fxg6 fxg6 21.Bxg6 hxg6 22.Qc3 e5 23.dxe6 e.p. Bxe6 or 18.Re1 Nd7 19.f4 Nf6 20.Bg5 Bg4} Bxa1 17. Rxa1 {OK, 17.Rxa1 is played, let's focus here. A) 17...d6 18.h5 e5 19. Qg5 (19.dxe6 e.p. Rxe6 20.Qg5 Qe7 and most of black's problems are solved; 19.Bg5 Nd7 20.h6 f5 and?) Qe7 20.Qg3 e4 21.Be2 Bf5 and slowly black develoops his pieces building a fortress around his king. } d6 18. h5 {It's going along the line. What did we have? 18...e5 I still think this is the best defensive move in order to activate the queenside. A) 19. Qg5 Qe7 20.Qg3 e4 21.Be2 Bf5 and slowly black develoops his pieces building a fortress around his king. B) 19.dxe6 e.p. Rxe6 (or Bxe6, prevents Bf5 later) B1) 20.Qg5 Qe7 and most of black's problems are solved B2) 20.Qg3 Kh8 21.hg fg 22.f3 b6 (to protect c5) C) 19.Bg5 Nd7 20.h6 f5 and?} e5 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Re1 Na6 {A) 21.Qg5 Qe7 B) 21.f4 Bd7 22.fe Rxe5 C) 21.a3 Bd7 22.Qg5 Qd8} 21. Qg5 Qe7 22. Qg3 Nb4 {? The strategic line is Nb4 -> Qf7 -> Nxd5 -> Qxd5, giving back some material and establishing three free pawns.  23.f4 Nxd3 24.Qxd3 Qf6 25.Bg5 Bf5 26.Bxf6 Bxd3 27.fe de 28.Bxe5/Rxe5 -  ...but, alas, as we will see g6 needed protection!} 23.

Re4 {I am not sure if this is not a mistake:  25...Rg8 26.Qh5 Qh7 27.Rh4 Bg4  A) 28.Bg7 Rxg7 and the a8 rook coves the back rank.  B) 28.Rxg4 RxR 29.QxR QxB and still -5.... -  As I wrote in move 23, I consider 25.Bg5 the strongest move.} Rg8 26. Qh5 Qh7 27. Qh4 {? I think this was it, the advantage gets lost.... or? For me, 27.Rh4 was the move to make.} Rg6 28. Qd8+ Qg8 29.

Nice move, that wins back some material. A) 34...Qh7 (mate threat on c2 if the rook moves!!) A1) 35.Bf6  Kg8 36.Rxg4  Rxg4 37.Qxg4  Kf8 (37...Kf7 38.Qe6  loses pawns)... and does he see the mate?? A2) 35.Rxg4  A21) 35...Rxg4 A22) 35...Qxh4 36.Rxh4  Kg7 37.Be7 loses pawns B) 34....Kg7 (exposes the king and lacks the above threat)} Qh7 35.
