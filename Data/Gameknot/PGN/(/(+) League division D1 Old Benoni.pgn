1. d4 {This is my first game annotated for the public. Please give me your comments for improvement! I chose this ame because I am a bit proud of he final combintion in Morphy-style, although my partner "kindly" assisted. As English is not my native language, I ask for your kind understanding in case of mistakes. I do my very best! ;)} c5 {As a player of he "Vulture", I used to answer 1.d4 always with c5, which gives black in an unbalanced position good chances for counterplay.} 2. Nf3 {In this variant, black develops a strong center formation. The normal answer is 2.d5 with the possible outcome 2...Nf6 3.c4 and then Black can play 3...Ne4 for the Vulture.} cxd4 3. Nxd4 d5 4. Nc3 e5 5. Nb3 Bb4 {There it is, the black pawn center. The bishop pins the white knight and so indirectly supports the center pawn on d5.} 6. Bd2 Nf6 7. e3 O-O {Black has his king's wing developed, white still trails behind.} 8. Be2 Bf5 9. f4 {? 0-0 is to be preferred.} exf4 {Opens up the diagonal g1-b6 which will eventually become important.} 10. exf4 Re8 {Attacking down the central line!} 11. O-O Nc6 12. Bb5 Qb6+ {Fritz suggests here 12...Bxc3 13.Bxc6 Bg4 14.Bxc3 Bxd1 15.Bxe8 Bxc2 with heavy black advantage. Here black catches a pawn.} 13. Kh1 Bxc3 14. Bxc6 Bxb2 15. Rb1 bxc6 16. Rxb2 {Black is a pawn ahead.} Bg4 17. Qb1 Ne4 {Lays the base for the combination to come. } 18. Ba5 {?? If white had known the basic manoevre to come, he would have played 18.Be1.} Nf2+ 19. Kg1 {? Here the last chance was to give the rook for the knight. But, as mentioned before, he "cooperates".} Nh3+ {! Here we go!} 20. Kh1 Qg1+ 21. Rxg1 Nf2# {Mate. Mmh, is that nice? :)}
