1. e4 {this was my second game against a well rated player, at the time he was 1801. i show an example of a good looking smothered mate. he was evidentlly a bit upset that he fell for an obvious move. this however does hold some merit and has a good look to it so it would be good to analyse.i took the white pieces.  e4 the move i will almost always open with} c6 {my opponent had already played me and lost so i think in playing the caro-kahn he was trying to throw me off gaurd in thinking perhaps i would not know it.} 2. d4 {this is in standards of the opening book. when black follows with d5 white will keep a good center with a pawn advance to e5} d5 3. e5 Bf5 {this is another book move with a bishop attaking a later weak pawn. once white has developed this move may be a cause for concern. } 4. Nf3 {white is in no immediate threat so a continuation of development is the best choice here.solidifying the center} e6 {this is still a book move. black tries to compensate the center  } 5. Be2 {this move primarily is done for me to castle.blacks bishop is poised at the moment so i want to go kingside out of harms way} Nd7 {the idea here is to advance a pawn to position his knight in the center after the exchange} 6. O-O {logical. also i was wanting to see what black had in mind} c5 {i saw this move without any worry} 7. Nc3 {thexchange looked good for black, this way i would have a better game if black takes the pawn} c4 {looks powerfull for black but all his play is on the queenside} 8. Be3 {development} a6 {stoping my knight moving to b5, i feel this is too pasive and so i begin my attack} 9. Qd2 {this move is the first in my attacking idea, somtimes you have to make a passive move to attack} Ne7 {now this is a mistake which i will take advantage of, better perhaps would have been bishop to b4} 10. Nh4 {many players would think this was illogical but it is ok for white. an attack on the kingside is forming} Rc8 {trying to free some space by using a rook lift but all is too late at this point also cramping his king. note there are no escape squares for the king} 11. Bg5 {now the knight cannot move i am setting up the mating move} h6 {black fails to see what i have planned} 12. Nxf5 {this seems a great move black will have a hard time even if he chooses to take the knight. from here there are only a few moves that will avoid the checkmate} hxg5 {this is not one of them. black gets too greedy. } 13. Nd6# {white doesnt mind giving up his dark bishop. a very nice smothered mate. just 13 moves against such a higly rated player. hope you have enjoyed}
