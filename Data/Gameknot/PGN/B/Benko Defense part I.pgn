1. d4 {Hello to all of us, this is an interesting gambit benko game i played in a d4 thematic tournament. } Nf6 2. c4 c5 {c5 may start Benko defense if white abandon the center with dxc, an easy why to retrieve it is Qa5+ and Qxc5.  but of course it is not a good idea.  90% white player may push d4-d5} 3. d5 {black can now play 3.. b5 (benko) or (e6 benoni)} b5 {the Benko line  } 4. cxb5 {note that Qa4+ retrieves the lost pawn} a6 {fool black giving a second pawn... note that benko gambit is one of most popular defense, and one of Polgar sisters preferred one. } 5. bxa6 {the aim of benko black defense is to make pressure on a2 and b2 pawns this activity is helped with a and b opened columns } Bxa6 {main line. gaining time to develop at queen side and now if white plays e4, of course Bxf1 Kxf1 and white king will have to build "manually" his castle with g3 Kg2} 6. Nc3 {consolidating the center and preparing e4} d6 7. e4 {the white reaction against benko gambit must be to take position at center.} Bxf1 8. Kxf1 g6 {the king's bishop fianchetto will add a force on b2. like the sicilian dragon, this bishop is very strong. note that the black pawn structure is stronger than the sicilian dragon, with the c5 extended "dragon tail".} 9. g3 Bg7 10. Kg2 O-O 11. f4 {why do white lost time to castle their king in g2, and played f4 ?  the usually answer is Nf3 } Nbd7 {keeping the control on e5. white cannot push e4-e5 yet } 12. Nf3 {another force on e5 ! } Qb8 {defending e5 again and ... makes pressure on b2. white bishop cannot move yet} 13. Re1 {putting another force on e5. but white did not solve their c1 bishop problem generally, it is better to solve problems first, before attacking } Ne8 {black put another force on e5, and retreat the knight without loosing time.} 14. Qc2 {white is over-protecting b2, perhaps to make their bishop going to d2 or e3 ?} Nc7 {transfer black forces at queen side, but making one less on e5} 15. e5 {white attacks immediatly; a good reaction} Qb7 {attacking d4 2 times, and looking directly to g2 king remember that in benko, when white push e5, the d5 pawn is immediatly weak.} 16. e6 {is the logic continuation} Nf6 {the d4 pawn is clearly lost for white} 17. exf7+ Rxf7 {letting a hole for the knight in e6} 18. Ng5 Ncxd5 {"!"  the d4 pawn is falling, and black is gaining a pawn. f7 rook is not takeable (Nxf7 ?? Ce3+)} 19. Nce4 Rff8 20. Qc4 Kh8 21. h3 {this is not correct. h3 was the good place for the king. one day, black will control the 2th line. } Nxe4 22. Qxe4 Ra4 {"!" a nice move, the rook is not takeable. (Qxa4 ?? Nc3+) it forces the queen to go to f3 } 23. Qf3 Rb8 {clearly attacks b2} 24. Kh2 {the king cannot go to a safe square; note that c1 bishop has not waken up} Rb4 {still putting forces on b2} 25. Re2 Bxb2 {earning a full pawn without counter attack} 26. Bxb2+ {the poor life of c1 bishop ...} Rxb2 27. Rae1 Rxe2+ {Qa6 was best} 28. Rxe2 Nf6 29. Qc3 Qb4 {"?" h6!} 30. Qxb4 Rxb4 31. Rxe7 c4 32. Rf7 {"?" Rc7 to avoid go promote} c3 33. Rxf6 {"?" clearly bad. there is no mate there} Rb2+ 34. Kg1 c2 35. Rf8+ Kg7 {a mate: Rf7 Kh6 ?? Rxh7 1-0} 36. Ne6+ Kh6 37. Rc8 Rb1+ 38. Kf2 c1=Q 39. Rxc1 Rxc1 {in this position black are winning. } 40. Kf3 Re1 41. Nd8 Ra1 {"??" a beginner move. } 42. Nf7+ Kg7 43. Nxd6 Rxa2 44. Ne4 {is this a draw position ? if you have any idea, tell me about it} Ra3+ 45. Kg4 Ra4 46. Ng5 h6 47. Nf3 Kf6 48. Ne5 h5+ 49. Kh4 Ra3 50. g4 {"??" black is winning the knight} g5+ {Kxh5 ?? Rxh3 0-1} 51. fxg5+ Kxe5 {now it is really the end.} 52. gxh5 Ra4+ 53. Kg3 Kf5 54. h4 Ra3+ 55. Kg2 Kg4 56. h6 Ra2+ 57. Kf1 Kh5 58. h7 Ra8 59. Kg2 Rh8 60. Kg3 Rxh7 {}
