Bxc6 {down goes the knight } dxc6 {down goes the bishop } 5. Nxe5 {an easy pawn gain } Qd4 {I had never seen this move before. It's a good counterattack. } 6. f4 {I attempt to defend the knight } Qxe4+ {ahh.....a good move here. This pawn evens things out. } 7. Qe2 {I decide to use my queen to guard the king } Qxe2+ {I was afraid of this. I don't like playing without my queen. } 8. Kxe2 {A required move. } Nf6 {I don't know why he did this. Development I think. } 9. Kd1 {I want to move the rook to get his king in check. } Bd6 {He decides to destroy the knight. } 10. Nd3 {I will have nothing of it. } Bg4+ {I think he knew my rook idea. } 11.

Kf1 {i must flee! } Bxh1 {Now he bites. } 20. Bg5 {I want revenge!!!!! } f6 {He doesn't care. lol } 21. Bd2 {I retreat. } Be4 {He never did like that knight. } 22.

Ke1 {I want the rook! } Ke3 {He wants...me!! } 34. Kd1 {I decide to run for it. } a5 {Kind of a pointless move I'm afraid. I wasn't planning to move that pawn anytime soon. } 35. Ke1 {Why did I do this? A HORRIBLE MOVE! } Rh1# {and he takes advantage. This was a very fun game to play. I made a few mistakes, but learned a thing or two also. GG. }
