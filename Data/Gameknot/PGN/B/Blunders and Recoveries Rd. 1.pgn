1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. c3 d6 5. d3 {Pretty simple stuff so far. I respond according to the development that my opponent makes. But d3 is a waste of tempo for white. c3 was played to open the opportunity of d4, but by playing d3, my opponent wasted the last move.} Bg4 6. O-O Nge7 {This is an interesting blunder, I missed a combination I should be used to by now. 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Ng5+ Kg8 8.Qxg4 I have played moves like these as white many times, and I guess I need to look out this opportunity for my opponent as well.} 7. Bd2 Qd7 8. Re1 Ng6 {My opponent missed the combination, and next move my queen miraculously covers the bishop on g4! Ideas that should have been running around in my opponents head are b4 and h3, to push those nice bishops back to their own battle lines.} 9. Be3 Nh4 10. Nbd2 f5 11. exf5 Qxf5 {This is my GRAVE blunder of the game. I noticed as soon as I let go of the piece, 12.Nxh4 Bxg4 13.Nxf5 and I am down a whole knight! And I would have had a bad position to boot!!} 12. d4 Nxf3+ {I was so relieved that my opponent missed this, that I immediately traded off that knight hardly thing about my move.} 13. Nxf3 Bb6 14. dxe5 Nxe5 15. Bd4 {Here, Qa4+ was better, so the knight would be free to capture on e5.} O-O-O 16. Bxe5 dxe5 17. Qb3 Rhe8 18. Bd5 Bxf3 19. Bxf3 e4 {I should have played e4 first, but I caught the right idea. I want that bishop gone, so I can smash into the castled king and make use of my super active rooks!} 20. Qc2 Rd3 21. Bxe4 Rxe4 {My opponent missed 21. Qxd3!! I don't know what I was thinking, allowing that to happen would have been truly tragic, since two rooks are better than my queen. But happily again, my blunders are not noticed, and I get to redeem the position. My x-ray tactic here prevents 22.Qxd3, since Rxe1+ 23.Rxe1 Qxf2 and I have in essence won. Gotta love those x-rays!} 22. Ref1 Rf4 23. c4 Rd8 24. Qxf5+ Rxf5 {These moves are chock full of inaccuracies. However, I did make moves that did not lose too much of my winning potential, and at this point I proudly maintain my Bishop for a pawn advantage.} 25. b4 c5 26. a3 cxb4 27. axb4 a6 28. c5 Bc7 {I figured, heck, why not trade some pieces? My advantage is not going anywhere, even if it isn't the best move. This will also give my opponent room to blunder some more ;)} 29. Rab1 Rd2 30. Rb3 Rc2 31. Rbb1 b6 32. cxb6 Bxb6 33. Rbe1 {My opponent just shuffles the pieces, which gives me an opportunity to improve my position. 33.Rbe1 Big Blunder! Here I have Rfxf2, and my opponent is forced to capture with rook, unless they want to get checkmated. Then I have Bxf2+ which makes me up a rook for a pawn!!!} Rcxf2 34. Rec1+ Rc2+ {I missed that specific line, but if I had taken the time to analyze the position then, I believe I could have found it. However, when I see a combination I like, I sometimes rush my moves and miss an even better combination. 34...Rc2+ I love revealed checks with attacks thrown in!} 35. Kh1 Rxf1+ 36. Rxf1 Rf2 {At this point I stopped notating, because my opponent had less than 5 minutes left on the clock, and I wanted to blitz. In the end, my opponent ended up flagging, after my pawn promotion to a queen! This was my first flag EVER in my history of chess tournaments! And as it turns out, not the only one in this tournament. Get ready for round 2! An even bigger blunder! A tactical endgame!}
