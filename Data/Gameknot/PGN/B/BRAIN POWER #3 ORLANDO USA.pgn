1. e4 {An neat little miniature from a recent mini-tournament.} e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 {The Greco defense. Bringing the queen out early, but deprives the knight of its post on f6.} 3. Nc3 c6 4. d4 Bb4 5. dxe5 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 {White has two doubled pawns, but due to Black's underdevelopment and poor queen placement, Crafty gives white a small edge! } Qg6 7. Qd6 {Hoping to un-double the e pawns or simply add pressure to the black camp.} Qxe4+ 8. Be3 Qxc2 {A tempting move, but Black is in heaps of trouble due to underdevelopment and his one developed piece, the queen, is too far away from the king to help with the coming shot...} 9. Bc5 {Threatening mate on f8. Black must play 9... Qxc3  10. Ke2(Nd2) Qxc5 11. Qxc5 ... with clearly a great game for White. } Kd8 {Leads to a forced mate in three, can you see it? } 10. Qf8+ {1} Kc7 11. Bd6+ {2} Kb6 12. Qd8# {3}
