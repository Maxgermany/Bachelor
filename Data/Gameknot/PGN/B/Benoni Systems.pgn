1. d4 c5 2. d5 {The starting position for this thematic tournament.  I used to like the Benoni when I was a teenager, and my admiration grew when I became aware that Tal was a major exponent, but my own experience with the opening is sorry...} Nf6 3. Nf3 d6 4. c4 e6 5. Nc3 exd5 6. cxd5 g6 7. e4 Bg7 {I think these are all standard moves so far.} 8. Bb5+ Nbd7 9. O-O O-O {Now that both players' kings are castled, we're both nearly fully developed, but both our queenside Bishops and Rooks are still at home and Black's B is blocked in by a knight.  White also seems to have more space, so appears to have the advantage at this stage.} 10. Bg5 {White develops his QB to an aggressive square, pinning Black's N against his Q.} h6 {Black naturally takes exception and tries to push the B away.} 11. Bf4 {The B only retreats one square but now threatens d6} Nb6 12. h3 a6 {Black pushes White back into his own half of the board} 13. Be2 Re8 {and threatens the e-pawn on the half-open e-file} 14. Qc2 {This is the natural defending move against the threat to the e-pawn} Nh5 {Black threatens White's Bishop to gain time for the advance of his f-pawn, thematic in most Indian defences.} 15. Bd2 Nd7 {As is manoeuvring of knights... e5 now looks like an attractive outpost.} 16. Rfe1 Ne5 17. Nxe5 Bxe5 {White reached the same conclusion and swapped off the N on e5 but now Black's fianchettoed B improves its position on its natural diagonal.} 18. Bxh5 {White swaps B for N and doubles Black's defensive pawns - a strong move.} gxh5 19. Bxh6 {especially with this follow-up} Qf6 {Black brigns up the heavy artillery to push White's B away.} 20. Qd2 {White supports the intruder.} Qg6 {Now Black lines up on White's King's position.} 21. Kh1 {So White sidesteps} Kh7 {and Black increases the numerical pressure on White's intrusive B} 22. Bf4 {which retreats only as far as necessary, attacking Black's B} Rg8 {Now Black threatens mate in one!  And White resigns.  He might have tried 23. Bg3 Bxg3 24. fxg3 Qxg3 24. Rg1 , which seems to hold; or 23. Rg1 Bd4 24. Be3... There's no obvious win for Black at this stage as far as I can see but then I'm rated more than 100 points less than White...}
