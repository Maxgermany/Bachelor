Bxf6 Qxf6 15. b3 Be6 16. bxc4 {Move forward to disrupt black's center pawn structure. It lets black pass a pawn, but the pawn is (so far) undefended by other pawns.} dxc4 17. Nb5 {Knight jumps to a precarious perch to threaten the bishop.} Bb4 18. Rf1 {Move to protect rook from bishop's glare.} Na6 19. a3 {Push pawn to convince bishop to move back.} Ba5 20. Ne5 {Another knight jumps to a precarious perch.} Rac8 {Black moves rook to back up the passed pawn on the c file.} 21. Nd6 {Knight forks two rooks!} c3 {Pushing a pawn makes it more dangerous - especially with the rook to back it up, but on the other hand, it exposes an unprotected black knight on a6.} 22. Nxe8 {Black now has to choose between saving the queen and saving the knight, so black resigned.}
