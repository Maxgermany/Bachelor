1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 a6 4. a3 b5 5. Ba2 e6 6. d4 c4 {An error. White's d-pawn will now be very powerful, and the hemming in of white's light-squared bishop is ephemeral, since b3 can bust it open at any time.} 7. O-O Nge7 {Intended to prepare d5. But black doesn't have enough time for this...} 8. d5 {A crucial move, securing the advantage allowed by black's mistake. A normal development move would allow black to play d5, with a strong center and light-square control. White may still be slightly better in that situation, with a dynamic pawn center, but it doesn't seem like a big advantage.} exd5 {Natural, but not good. Black would be better off with a closed e-file, as we will see.} 9. exd5 Na5 10. d6 {Simply winning a knight. There's nothing black can do anymore.} Nac6 11. Re1 {No need to take it right away! The knight can't move...why not let it block in its own bishop for awhile before taking it?} Na5 {These ridiculous knight moves show that black has no good ideas in this position. Although a number of moves might have done some good, such as Bb7 or Qb6.} 12. Bg5 {Not really sure if this was necessary. The bishop needed to be developed, and I was in a mood to sacrifice pieces for initiative. It might be unsound, but worked well in this game.} f6 13. Ne5 {Probably wrong, but making life complicated for my opponent...} fxe5 {The correct move. If the knight isn't taken, mate will follow.} 14. Rxe5 Nac6 {Now I had to make up for the fact that my queen, powerful as she looks, can't really do anything in this situation. A tactical withdrawal to Re3 might have been best. As it was I made the unforced trade when I had a positional advantage. Not a good decision on my part...} 15. dxe7 Bxe7 16. Bxe7 Nxe7 17. Qd6 {A good move, retaining some of my initiative. I had seen this far ahead and decided that Qd6 would be effective. It was, but I'm still not sure it's as good as just quietly waiting until he forced the trades would have been.} Rf8 18. Nc3 Rf6 19. Qd5 Ra7 20. Qg8+ {Good, but maybe not the best. I think that with accurate play black can still get a draw here.} Rf8 21. Qxg7 d6 22. Rd1 Qc7 23. Re3 Rf7 24. Qg8+ Rf8 25. Qxh7 Kd8 26. Qg7 Rf5 27. Ne4 d5 28. Nf6 {This move wins the game. Black's best try is probably to trade the rook...Rxf6, Qxf6. But after that the knight is pinned again, and therefore the d-pawn is hanging. Black has no counterplay that I can see, and that situation would be bad. If he doesn't trade, the next move is Qf8 mate, or, if the queen moves out of the way, Qf4+ followed by Rxe7, winning a knight, and it won't stop there.} Qc5 29. Qf8+ Kc7 30. Rxe7+ {Gotta be careful; black would love to get in Qf2+, although he'd still need one more move to setup a mating attack.} Kc6 31. Qxc8+ Kd6 32. Qxc5+ Kxc5 {At this point, it's over...and I was tired. But I sort of suspect that Ne4+ would have been slightly better than Rxa7, which is what I played.} 33. Rxa7 Rxf6 34. Rd7 Re6 35. Rd7xd5+ Kc6 {Now I was really tired...} 36. Rd5d6+ Rxd6 37. Rxd6+ Kxd6 38. f4 Ke6 39. Kf2 Kf5 40. Kf3 a5 41. g4+ Kf6 42. c3 {Black resigned.}
