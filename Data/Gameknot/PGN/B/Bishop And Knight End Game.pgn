1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. d4 f6 6. Be3 Ba6 7. Nbd2 Ne7 8. c4 Ng6 9. d5 cxd5 10. cxd5 Qd7 11. b3 Be7 12. Nc4 O-O 13. O-O c6 14. h3 Bb7 15. dxc6 Bxc6 16. Qd3 d5 17. exd5 Bxd5 18. Rad1 Rfd8 19. Nfd2 Nh4 20. Ne4 h6 21. Nc3 Be6 22. Qxd7 Rxd7 23. Rxd7 Bxd7 24. Rd1 Be6 25. Nb5 Bxc4 26. bxc4 a5 27. Rd7 Kf8 28. Kf1 Nf5 29. Bb6 Rc8 30. Rc7 Rxc7 31. Bxc7 {Alright here's another end game,i am white,my opponent is black. This game is about grinding down your opponent with the center. having the center is extremely important in the end game,not having it can result a loss. In this game my opponent made a mistake causing him to loose the center and the game.} a4 {my bishop was attacking that a5 pawn so just moving it out of the bishop's sight is ok to do. You may ask ''why not 31. ... Bb4?'' which seems ok however the problem with that move is that now the bishop becomes defensive. In the end game you dont want to be defensive because you won't have any chances of winning. it's better to be aggressive even tho you might not win that piece.} 32. Ke2 {Now i am aiming to move the king closer to the center,centralizing the king is a good thing to do,heck centralizing every piece is a good thing to do in the end game. Even tho i feared Nh4 to create weaknesses on the king side i decided that my king really needs to get in to the game. and as long as i stay on light squares i should be ok. as you see most of my pieces are on light squares to avoid the dark squared bishop. Now you are probably wondering also why not Nc3? well i feared the let go of the d4 and d6 squares and decided that i can play that move maybe later but first getting my king up is my main objective. Getting the knight off the center was a scary thing to do,i decided it is on an ok outpost at the moment.} Bc5 {Bc5. Well the bishop is simply better placed on c5 than on e7. Now it is targeting the f2 pawn preventing my king from moving to d3 which was my plan (d3-e4-d5 to support that passed pawn). also he is using a trick,he is blockading my passed pawns and that is an excellent thing to do in the end game.} 33. Kf3 {i have to go to f3 instead if i want to move up. The downside with this move is that it is blocking in the f2 pawn. however i wasn't planning to camp on f3 anyways.} Ke7 {now he is moving his king closer to the center. the second point is moving to e6 (out of my bishop's range and protecting that knight)} 34. Ke4 {see? told you i wasn't going to stay on f3. moving the king to the center was my point all a long.} Ke6 {just defending the knight while attacking f2 on the same time} 35. f4 {i decided the the most important thing to do here is Not letting his king come in to the 5th rank. exchanging pawns remove the pressure and making my king more elastic on the 4th rank. in the end game you don't want to give up ranks,they are important as well as seizing a file in the middle game.} Ng3+ {well we could expect this move,pushing my king back} 36. Kf3 {attacking his knight} exf4 37. Bxf4 {recapture} Nf5 38. Ke4 {this position is better for white than a few moves back,all his pieces are out of the white squares expect the dark squared bishop. } Ne7 {This move was a mistake. firstly he over looked my next move which is strong, secondly he is moving away from the center and now i am trying to use the center to grind him down, making him cramped until he will have no way out and this is interesting to see.} 39. Nc7+ {a good move, of course now it isn't possible to play Nc3 but i was really afraid of playing Nc3,moving pieces away from the center. but this move pushes his king back which is the first step of taking out my foe.} Kd7 {Kd7 Best move here but now comes a good move} 40. Na6 {Na6. I am knocking off that bishop from blockading my passed pawns and now things become to heat up.} Bg1 {well in this position exchanging his dark squared bishop for my knight is just loosing for him since it is generally known a bishop is better than a knight.} 41. c5 {c5. now i am planning to move my pawn to queen. Look on the difference on the position now and after 38. Ke4. he has two pieces pushed down.} Kc6 {blockading the pawn with his king a king is a good blockader in the very end game due to if it gets knocked off it can simply move one step backwards and it will take time queening that passed pawn.} 42. Bd6 {another pushing move. it also protects that c5 pawn} Nc8 43. Bf8 {now do you see why it's better to have pieces on light squares against a dark squared bishop? i believe the Bishop is excellent placed on f8 even if those three pawns under him wouldn't be there.} Bh2 {i think he wanted to move his bishop to e5 or something like the just preventing my king from assisting the blocked passed pawn.} 44. Nb4+ {another good move,knocking his king back} Kd7 45. c6+ {moving further in with my pawn} Kc7 46. Kd5 {You see now what i mean with grinding my opponent down via center? he is cramped here in this position. It's like Kramnik,everyone keeps saying he is good on squeezing like this} a3 {he didnt know what else to do.} 47. Bxg7 {I was really confused what to do in this position. i didnt want to let go of the e7 and d6 squares but i couldn't see any other move to advance my pawn. that's why i decided to just win material,i figured nothing bad would happen.} Bd6 {attacking the knight sharply} 48. Kc4 {i judged 48. ... Bxb4 49. Kxb4 Kxc6 50. Kxa3 wins for white.} h5 {not sure what the point of this move was,maybe he could have played Na7 or Ne7 instead.} 49. Bxf6 Nb6+ {Nb6 came instead.} 50. Kb5 {Now you would think 50. ... Bxb4 51. Kxb4 Nd5+ wins however white plays 51. Be5+ instead.} Nc8 {Nc8?? Overlooked my next move which wins} 51. Na6# {Good game. and i hope you understand that i won because i managed to push his pieces of the center and make him cramped. that's why controlling the center is highly important in the end game.}
