[Opening "Nimzo-Indian (E31), Leningrad, main line"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {The players opt for a Nimzo-Indian.} 4. Bg5 {Timman chooses the Leningrad variation.} h6 5. Bh4 c5 6. d5 d6 7. e3 g5 {Winants decides to break the irritating pin.} 8. Bg3 Ne4 9. Qc2 Qf6 10. Nge2 exd5 {Black chooses a natural move, the assumption being that after the recapture on d5, a bishop on f5 would be strong, 'x-ray' attacking the queen, and protecting the e4-knight. However, Timman noticed how important his lead in development (even if slight) was. } 11. O-O-O {(!) Proof of development mattering most! White threatens 12.Nxd5!... So Black cannot play his dream move of 11...Bf5, nor 11...Nxf2. } Bxc3 12. Nxc3 Nxc3 {Black decided to remove the knights... But the advantage for White grew with...} 13. Qxc3 {(!) } Qxc3+ {Black's other options were poor : If 13...d4 then 14.exd4 Nc6 15.Qe3+!...} 14. bxc3 dxc4 {It could have been slightly better (but still bad!) if 14...Ke7 since 15.h4 g4 16.Rxd5 Rd8 17.Rh5...} 15. Bxc4 {Black will soon lose his extra pawn. White also has the edge of the bishop pair. His rooks will soon dominate the d-file.} Be6 16. Bxe6 fxe6 17. Rxd6 Ke7 18. Rhd1 {All of White's pieces dominate... Black's pieces are lagging behind.} Kf6 19. f4 {(!)} Nc6 20. fxg5+ hxg5 21. Rd6d7 {(!) Threats that Black cannot meet...} b6 22. Rf1+ Kg6 23. Rd6 Nd8 {Note how Black's pieces are forced to the back rank to prevent material catastrophe.} 24. Be5 {Black resigned here due to the impending 24...Re8 25.g4!... with 26.Rf6+ to follow. A masterclass by Timman on development!}
