1. g3 {An unusual opening leading to a King's Indian attack set-up for White} d5 {I have to confess using the database to find my way through the first few moves although taking control of the centre is the sensible response} 2. Bg2 e5 3. b3 Nf6 4. Bb2 {Now White has fianchettoed both bishops which continues his unusual opening} Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd6 6. O-O O-O 7. d3 Re8 8. c4 d4 {This seems the best response although the ideal pawn centre early in the game would be pawns on d5 and e5} 9. a3 a5 {To prevent b4  - obviously after b4 and axb4 White's a-pawn is pinned} 10. a4 Nb4 11. Ba3 c5 12. Bxb4 axb4 13. Qd2 Bd7 14. Nh4 {After a few poor moves which have locked up the Queenside this move allows a bit of an attack on White's King} Qc8 {With a view to Bh3} 15. e3 Bh3 {Hoping for Bxh3 Qxh3 then if possible Ng4 with a powerful and possibly mating attack} 16. Re1 {But White sensibly avoids the Bishop exchange} e4 {So I try another combination to attack White's Queen} 17. dxe4 Nxe4 18. Bxe4 Rxe4 19. exd4 Rxd4 {The point of e4} 20. Qe3 {I had expected Qe2 but now another idea springs to mind} Qg4 {Covers the Rook } 21. Ng2 {This has to be a mistake as it now allows the tactic which will win me material and ultimately the game} h6 {An intermediate move to give my King an escape square from the attack on my back rank} 22. Nd2 {As expected - and wished for} Bxg2 {Now - the point of this is not to capture the Knight but to move the King} 23. Kxg2 Bf4 {Into a winning combination which pins the g-pawn and skewers White's Queen and Knight} 24. Qe2 Qxe2 {Must capture the Queen first obviously, as the immediate Bxd2 would lose to Qxg4} 25. Rxe2 Bxd2 26. Re5 b6 27. Rd1 {Not what I had expected - Rd5 looks more interesting as Rxd5 cxd5 gives White two passed pawns - the a-pawn is also a threat of course} Rad8 {Reinforcing the attacked Bishop} 28. h4 {This seems like a move for the sake of moving} Bc3 {I'd had this in mind for a couple of moves} 29. Rxd4 cxd4 {Of the three possible re-captures this looks best as it gives me the passed pawn covered by the Rook and the discovered attack on Black's Rook next move. With this and a piece down White concedes}
