[Opening "Sicilian (B20), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 c5 {Hooray, my favourite opening!} 2. g3 {Dang I've never played this variation before.  So now I have to improvise.} Nc6 3. Bg2 d6 4. Nc3 g6 {Trying to mirror his kingside position.} 5. d3 Bg7 6. f4 {I don't understand why everyone wants to play a closed game where the pawns just pile on.  I much prefer open games where the primary point is coordinating your pieces. Although in the past I have suffered due to insufficient space for my pieces to operate on, recently I have gotten rid of this weakness and my opponents have paid for attempting to lock me up with pawns.} Nf6 7. Nf3 Bg4 {I just love these pins.  They are so effective at preventing my opponent from attacking! It is highly unlikely now that white can do anything more with those pawns, as white risks shattering his pawn structure. Anyhow, my development is complete before white's!} 8. O-O O-O 9. h3 {Forcing a trade, but costs white a move.} Bxf3 10. Bxf3 {I would have taken with the queen.} Qd7 11. Kh2 Nd4 {This does so many things - attacks the bishop, prevents f5, attacks the c2 pawn, and opens up stace for my queen!} 12. Bg2 {Quite unnecessary.  He should be glad to trade his bishop for my strong knight.} Qe6 {I wasn't quite sure what to do, but I really wanted to break up those pawns, perhaps with d5, and make white suffer because his king would be exposed.} 13. Ne2 Nd7 {This also does so many things: opens up my bishop's view, reinforcing my d4 knight, making my d7 knight more useful, and preventing e5.  It does limit my queen's abilities though, but since neither of the f or e pawns can advance without loss of material, my queen is safe. However, f5 could be an idea for white, as it breaks up my king's protective dome and white gets a strong kingside attack.} 14. c3 Nxe2 {Forced move.  Look at my opponent's pawn structure! Isn't it funny?} 15. Qxe2 f5 {Now my queen cannot be trapped, and white's pawn structure is inevitably broken.} 16. Bd2 fxe4 17. dxe4 Nb6 18. b3 Rac8 19. Rae1 c4 20. b4 Qf7 21. Be3 {? Mistake.  Apparently he forgot about his c3 pawn.} Bxc3 22. Reb1 Bg7 23. Qc2 {He should take my knight since it creates doubled pawns.  But in this case they're not so bad.} e6 24. Rfd1 Qc7 25. a4 Nd7 {This was an intentional "mistake".  I realized that I had no chance of queening my passed pawn, so I wanted to get my knight to the kingside to head off an attack on white's king, and coax out mistakes from white. So basically I gave up the pawn.} 26. Qd2 {Wasted move.  I would have played 26. Bf1, winning the passed pawn.} c3 27. Qc2 a6 28. Rbc1 e5 {Now his king is starting to become naked.} 29. Qb3+ {Pointless check. This should have been saved for a future moment.} Kh8 30. Rc2 exf4 31. gxf4 Nf6 {Preparing Nh5.  Yes this is another intentional "mistake", sacrificing a pawn.  All I wanted was to get rid of the f4 pawn, so his king would be wide open.} 32. Bd4 {Expected move! Despite computers claiming white to have a slight advantage here, I believe psychologically I have the advantage because of more possibilities of an assault on white's king. This is now a completely open game and requires acute accuracy from white to maintain the advantage.} Nh5 33. Rxc3 {33. Bxg7+ does nothing for white.} Qe7 {Already planning ahead.} 34. Bxg7+ Qxg7 35. Rxc8 Rxc8 36. Rxd6 Nxf4 {Now black has a gazillion threats and white must deal with them accurately. This position is now quite complicated. I'm not going to analyze all the variations because that is too difficult.} 37. Qd1 Qe5 38. Rd8+ Rxd8 39. Qxd8+ Kg7 40. Qd7+ Kh6 {At this point the game should be at least a draw for white.  After Qxb7, white is a pawn up and all of white's pawns are safe and the discovered check won't really do anything harmful, although it won't be difficult for black to force a draw by perpetual check.} 41. h4 {?? The turning point of the game.  Not only does white lose the pawn advantage, white will be two pawns down after 41. Nxg2+ Kxg2 42. Qxe4+ Kg3 43. Qxb4, and unable to force perpetual. What was white thinking?  Perhaps white didn't want a draw?} Nxg2+ 42. Kxg2 Qxe4+ 43. Kh3 {? White loses here 100%.  Black's queening process is now unstoppable.} Qf5+ 44. Qxf5 gxf5 45. Kg3 Kh5 46. b5 axb5 47. axb5 b6 48. Kf4 Kxh4 49. Kxf5 Kg3 {There is no way for white to live.} 50. Kg5 {}
