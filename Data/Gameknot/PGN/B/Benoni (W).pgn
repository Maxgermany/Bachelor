1. d4 Nf6 {Benoni} 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 {Still following the main modern benoni line} 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {Now, it's definitely a benoni.} 6. Bg5 {Usually white plays e4.} Be7 {Black abandons the fiancheto line.} 7. Nf3 O-O {Securing the king.} 8. e3 {I would have expected e4} Nbd7 {a6 was another candidate move} 9. Bc4 {I see little interrest in this move for white's d pawn is already supported and not under attack.} Nb6 {To attack white's undefended LSB} 10. b3 {Defending the LSB} Bf5 {Black devellops his LSB while he can (for it's not so easy in Benoni).} 11. O-O Ne4 {Fork attack (wether by 12. ... Nxg5 or by 12. Nxc3)} 12. Bxe7 {Only move to save both c knight and DSB} Qxe7 {Now black's plan is to attack the white king straight ahead.} 13. Nb5 {It achieves little} a6 14. Na3 {Only retreating place for the white knight who is now far away from both kings and therefore not dangerous.} Nc3 {Menacing the queen.} 15. Qd2 Qf6 {The black queen is now on the 6th line, before her pawns, ready to menace the white king by 16. ... Qg6 or 16. Qh6.} 16. Rac1 {To fire the black knight.} Ne4 {Coming on the king side and menacing the white queen.} 17. Qe1 Rfe8 {Before launching his attack black need more pieces ready.} 18. h3 {To secure the king but weakening it.} Bxh3 {Opening the white's king defense.} 19. Bd3 Ng5 {Menacing  20. gxh3 Nxf3+ and taking the queen.} 20. Be2 {To protect the f knight.} Bxg2 21. Kxg2 {Forced move if white doesn't want to lose his rook.} Re4 {Bringing more material by the e8 e4 highway and menacing mate by 22. Rg4+ 23.Kh2 Qh6+ 24. Nh4 Qxh4 #} 22. Rg1 {To provide an escape square for the white king.} Rg4+ {White has only one move.} 23. Kf1 {Forced move.} Nxf3 {White has only one move to avoid losing his queen or mate.} 24. Bxf3 Qxf3 {Now black has the material advantage as well as the positionnal one.} 25. Rxg4 Qxg4 {Black attack comes to an end for the moment but white is doomed at middle term.} 26. Nc4 {Trying a counterattack.} Nxc4 {The exchange is in black favour.} 27. Rxc4 Qh3+ {gaining one tempo.} 28. Kg1 {Maybe Ke2 would have been better.} Re8 {More material to attack the black king (black's pawn block eventual queenside attacks)} 29. Rf4 Re5 {Menacing 30. ...Rg5+ 31.Rg4 Rxg4# Unavoidable except if white had sacrified his queen by 30. Qe2 Rg5+ 31. Rg4 Rxg4 32. Qxg4 Qxg4+ and black would be one queen and 2 pawns ahead. So that white submits.}
