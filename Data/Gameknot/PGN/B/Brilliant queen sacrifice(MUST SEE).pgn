1. d4 g6 2. c4 {I like to open up d4 c4 during the majority of my games regardless of the response.} Bg7 {developing his bishop} 3. Nc3 {knight developed} Nf6 {he develops knight} 4. Nf3 {i develop second knight} O-O {he castles early on} 5. Bg5 {i threaten to pin his knight if he pushes the e pawn} c6 6. e3 {open up my bishop} Na6 {interesting. Personally wouldnt have played c6 and would have played Nc6 last move} 7. Bd3 {develop my last piece and prepare to castle} d5 {trys to get some control of the center} 8. cxd5 Nxd5 {i take, he takes} 9. O-O {I finally castle} f6 {he attacks my bishop} 10. Bh4 {i move back} Nac7 {he defends his knight?} 11. Qb3 {pin the knight} Be6 {he unpins the knight} 12. Bc4 {should have taken b7} b5 {and he defends the free pawn} 13. Bxd5 cxd5 {?? should have taken with the bishop or knight. Now loses a pawn} 14. Nxb5 {I take the free pawn} Rb8 {Oh no... Decision time. Allow for myself to lose the knight or should I play risky and go all out} 15. Nxc7 {! His pieces are aligned for me to somehow get a material advantage} Rxb3 {Of course he takes the queen} 16. Nxe6 {I take the bishop and now his queen and both rooks are being attacked} Qb6 {Removes his queen from the attack but should have played Qc8 which would have won my knight} 17. Nxf8 {I take this rook for the maximum advantage. Taking the other rook he takes my knight and its a drawn game in terms of points} Rxb2 {He must move his rook out of danger} 18. Nd7 {Only safe spot} Qb5 {He attacks my knight but..} 19. Nc5 {im safe and +2} Qb8 20. Bg3 {I attack his queen and have all my pieces safe} Qc8 {he moves} 21. h3 a5 {open a spot for my king} 22. Rfb1 {offer a trade} Rxb1+ {he accepts} 23. Rxb1 {i like my chances now but i cant make any mistakes such as allowing the queen to fork two pieces} e5 {He tries to win my knight} 24. Nd2 {I bring my knight into the action} exd4 25. exd4 {I continue to trade down... But i somehow miss Rb8 which wins the queen and effectively ends the game} Qf5 {I cant move my knight on d2} 26. Ncb3 {i attack his a pawn} a4 {he defends and attacks my knight} 27. Nc5 {I attack again} Bf8 {I'm fine with the trade if he choses to} 28. Rb4 {I attack his pawn} Bxc5 {he trades} 29. dxc5 {i take back} Qc2 {he attacks my knight and pawn } 30. Nf3 {safe move} Qxc5 {he takes} 31. Rxa4 {I take} Kg7 {Why?} 32. Ra8 {I begin the treacherous path of promoting} d4 {He tries to promote as well} 33. Bf4 {Not so fast} d3 {He moves again} 34. Bd2 {No reason for that move by me} h5 35. a4 {I push} Qc6 {He attacks my rook } 36. Ra7+ {I check } Kf8 {he must move} 37. a5 {I push again} Qc5 {He attacks} 38. Be3 {I defend both} Qc2 {Does nothing?} 39. Ra8+ {I check } Ke7 40. a6 {and push} Qc6 {He attacks both} 41. Ra7+ {So I check} Kd8 42. Nd4 {and attack his queen} Qb6 {He attacks my rook. Hopefully I can make use of a discovered attack in the future! It looks good} 43. Ra8+ {I check } Ke7 {and he falls into the trap} 44. Nf5+ {game, set, match. I remember going through the variations and winning anyway but this was the easiest way} gxf5 45. Bxb6 {Now i have won} d2 {Ooph... I almost missed that but I had calculated} 46. Rd8 {Saved.} Ke6 47. Rxd2 {I take the pawn} Ke5 48. a7 {and he rightfully resigns. Good game richardevans. Please rate and comment mistakes or any observations. Thank you for viewing my game.
