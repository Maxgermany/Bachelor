1. Nf3 {1. Nf3 - Steve kicks off with the Reti Opening.  I respond by developing my own king knight.  Btw - I forgot to mention in my intro.  There is a Gameknot Analysis version of this game which you can access with this link to follow the game more easily:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14031703&rnd=0.9442240877866768} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. d4 {3. ..... d4 - white starts to build a pawn centre.  In the meanwhile I decided to fianchetto Fou Lenoir on g7.} Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. Bg5 d6 {5. ..... d6 - gotta start thinking about developing my queenside - this move does open up the c8-h3 diagonal for Fou Leblanc.} 6. e3 Nbd7 {6. ...... Nbd7 - firstly my queen knight goes to d7.  Must think of some other way to bring out Fou Leblanc.} 7. Be2 c6 8. Qc2 h6 {8. ..... h6 - putting the question to white's dsb.} 9. Bh4 e5 {9. ..... e5 - at last a pawn break in the centre.} 10. h3 Re8 11. O-O Nf8 {11. ..... Nf8 - to re-open the diagonal for Fou Leblanc.} 12. Rfd1 Qc7 {12. ..... Qc7 - Glenda moves onto the b8-h2 diagonal, a potential threat to the WK later on perhaps?} 13. Bg3 b6 14. b4 a5 15. b5 {15. b5 - a queenside pawn storm.  I decided to poke Steve's king knight with 15. ...... e4.} e4 16. Nd2 Bf5 {16. ...... Bf5 - Fou Leblanc bolsters up the e5 pawn which stays there until he is sacrificed for line clearance later on in the game.} 17. bxc6 Qxc6 18. c5 {18. c5 - here it looks as though I am about to drop the exchange.  I decided to save my weak d6 pawn and allow the skewer.  Now you would not see that weak little d6 pawn as a berserker, would you?} dxc5 19. Bb5 Qc8 20. Bxe8 {20. Bxe8 - as anticipated but now comes an intermezzo on d4 - the move cxd4 pins the queen knight to the WQ, or the Wicked Witch of the West as I think of the enemy queen.} cxd4 21. Qb3 {31. Qb3 - gameknot identified this move as a mistake and suggested 21. exd4 as the alternative.  Please see the abovementioned link in Note 1 for further detail.} Be6 22. Qxb6 {22. Qxb6 - another mistake because it now allows me to get two pieces for the rook - which in my personal experience is a winning advantage.} dxc3 {22. ...... dxc3 - look how far that d6 pawn has travelled now.  He really has gone berserk!  That little footman is just two squares away from Glendadom and look how two white minor pieces are en prise.} 23. Rac1 Qxe8 {23. ....... Qxe8 - Glenda gleefully rids me of one turbulent priest.} 24. Nb3 Nd5 {24. ..... Nd5 - bolsters up that precious footman and puts the Wicked Witch under the hammer.} 25. Qc5 Nb4 {25. ...... Nb4 - I decided to put the pawn on a2 under the hammer.  If 26. a3 then Nd3 forks Q and R on c1.} 26. Rxc3 Bxc3 {26. ..... Bxc3 - hmmph - I am now a piece ahead but Gameknot Analysis does not like Bxc3, please refer to the link for further detail.  I guess, while white has a dsb and the queens are on the board, there is a possibility of Henry being checkmated by Qg7# so I must be a little careful here.} 27. Qxc3 Nxa2 {27. ...... Nxa2 - now I get a passed a pawn.} 28. Qc2 Qa4 {28. ...... Qa4 - pin and pile up of the knight on b3.} 29. Nd4 Qxc2 30. Nxc2 {30. Nxc2 - queen trade.} Bb3 31. Rd2 a4 {31. ...... a4 - passed pawns must be pushed.} 32. Nd4 Rc8 33. Rb2 Nc1 {33. ..... Nc1 - defending Fou Leblanc and freeing up the advance of my a pawn towards Glendadom.} 34. Rb1 Ne6 35. Be5 {35. Be5 - Gameknot said that this move was another mistake - again please refer to the link for description and alternatives.  I now decided to try and simplify further by getting rid of the knight on d4.} Nxd4 36. exd4 {36. exd4 - Steve chooses to recapture with his e pawn to create a passer of his own.} a3 37. d5 {37. d5 - it is tempting to capture the pawn straight away with Bxd5 but I see a useful tempo-gaining intermezzo (in-between move) with a2.  That passer is only 1 square from Glendadom now.} a2 38. Ra1 Bxd5 {38. ..... Bxd5 - In the chat, Steve had this to say about my move.  "I thought you were going to play 38. Nd3 In so doing, you attack my DSB, forcing me to move it. You then follow with 39. Rc1+ Rxc1 40. Nxc1 d6 41. Ba4 After that, I have nothing 42. Nc3 43. a1."  However, he went on to say that my following play was just as good.} 39. Kh2 {39. Kh2 - Steve tries to tuck away his king to comparative safety, but the net is closing in.} Rc2 40. Bg3 Nb3 {40. ..... Nb3 - my pawn must crown, unless Steve decides to give up his rook for it.} 41. Rd1 a1=Q 42. Rxd5 {42. Rxd5 - interesting, Steve kills off Fou Leblanc but spares Glenda's life.  Glenda, however, is gonna make Steve rue that decision!} e3 {42. ...... e3 - I thought long and hard about this move, if Steve takes on e3 then Qf1 is deadly as I do not see any good defense to Qxg2#.  I am aware that Old Matey is not too far away from Henry.  I must be really careful, especially if Steve's dsb can get onto the h8-a1 diagonal and Steve's rook can give a check on my first rank.  I must watch out for Rh8#.  Sure enough Steve does check on d8.} 43. Rd8+ Kh7 44. fxe3 {44. fxe3 - that rook check has become little more than a spite check.  Glenda now moves to f1 as mentioned in my previous note.} Qf1 45. Be5 {45. Be5 - this move does threaten mate on h8 but thankfully Glenda can get in first.....} Qxg2# {45. .... Qxg2 MATE!!  -  Commiserations, Steve!}
