[Opening "Reti opening (A05)"]

1. Nf3 {*back one for intro* My standard as of late. Shooting for a Reti, but ready and willing to transpose to QG lines.} Nf6 2. d4 d5 3. c4 e6 {I'm perversely proud of the fact that I've never in my OTB life played 1. e4, so any variation of QGD lines are just fine by me.} 4. cxd5 {For anyone putting together a scouting report on me, this capture will absolutely, positively be made in this position every time. My goal is to jump on the c file as quickly as possible via Rc1 after developing the queenside pieces (Bg5 and Nc3 or Nd2).} exd5 {Correct. [4...Nxd5 e4! with tempo and a nice real estate grab]} 5. Nc3 Be6 {?! f5 and g4 are much more natural squares. This bishop is now basically a pawn.} 6. Bg5 {Everything is moving along as planned.} Nbd7 {I liked this move for black. His probable c5 push and his pinned knight are both supported.} 7. e3 Bb4 8. Bd3 c6 {Black gets a Slav pawn in, and both sides near completion of development.} 9. Qc2 {Castling also crossed my mind here, as it is usually wise to do so early and it would break a pesky pin, but I reconsidered when I realized I could safely delay doing so while double tapping h7. I'm gambling a little here that he will make what I considered to be a logical next move in 0-0, thereby winning a pawn as his Nf6 is pinned to his queen.} O-O {Bingo....he didn't see the tactic.} 10. Bxh7+ Kh8 11. Bd3 {Ok, the egomania I mentioned in the intro kicks into high gear. I'm now a pawn up with a pleasing and active position. Time to liquidate everything in sight.} Qc7 {Black is far from dead, and still has numerous dangerous possibilities. This move unpins the queen and claims a dangerous diagonal should I 0-0.} 12. Bf4 {BxN only assists black in moving forward, so I opt to just check his queen. I feel sure enough that he won't want to give up that diagonal and play Bd6, allowing me to more safely liquidate.} Bd6 13. Bxd6 Qxd6 {Black has played as I predicted so far, and I'm feeling great. I'm going to go 4-0 and sweep the section. I'd like to thank the Academy, my parents, all of the wonderful people behind the scenes........} 14. h4 {As I still have my nice battery and my Rh1 is on a semi-opened file facing the enemy monarch, I decide to give my h pawn a battlefield promotion to Kamakaze. I'm prepared to sac him for just about anything to open that h file, and I see 0-0-0 in my near future.} Nh5 {! Nice move. My h pawn is now stalled and g4 is not possible.} 15. Bf5 {?! In retrospect, probably not best. My plan was BxB QxB with heat on his Nh5, but it didn't really occur to me that he would simply ignore my bishop offering and play.......} Ndf6 {Whoa.....slow down there fella. You are supposed to lamely submit to my will and make moves that I intend you to. You are screwing around with my coronation.} 16. Ne5 {?! Ego made this move, pure and simple. And it's not a bad move. It's just not the right move. Better was probably just to go ahead trade off light squared bishops and get closer to an advantageous endgame. After my lapse the last move, I decide to make what I considered to be the most threatening looking move I could to re-establish my dominance in this mental struggle. I continue to think of how cool 4-0 sounds and my grasp of the game at hand starts slipping. } Nd7 {!? Normally not wise to trade down when behind in material, this move got my leg to shaking. BxB fxB activates his Rf8. NxN trades down, but I lose a beautifully posted knight and his threat on f7 (which may come in handy as I'm still seriously bearing down on his king). So, I decide to start attacking in earnest by playing.....} 17. g4 {?! Good and bad. Good in the sense I press forward with my assualt on his kingside and still have time to 0-0-0, but bad in the sense that I help him get his Nh5 off of the edge and into a more active role. I'd give white a small edge here, but it is tenuous. After dissecting this game, I'm pretty sure 0-0-0 was needed here immediately, as my upcoming meltdown is aggravated by the fact that my king is still in the center of the board. I continue to think I'm invincible.} Nhf6 18. Nxd7 {Now more comfortable with exchanges as my g and h pawns are now free to raise some Cain.} Qxd7 19. Bxe6 Qxe6 {Just like I pictured it in my head. Hey, wait a minute! My g pawn is hanging! How did that happen? I better protect it, and fast!} 20. f3 {?? Your PC is working just fine. You are not experiencing technical difficulties. I actually made this move in public. All of my inner dialogue garbage about how great I am distracted me to the point of an actual mental vacuum. In my rush to protect my g pawn, I open the front door and ask the armed assailant wearing a mask if he would like to come in for a cup of coffee.} Qxe3+ {Gravity just increased by a factor of 10 and I bear a litter of 8 kittens right on the chessboard. I hate my life. I now face a full frontal assualt right down Broadway.} 21. Qe2 {The e file is now electric, but I felt I had no choice. Given the choice of keeping either my d or f pawn, I choose the f pawn because I will need some king cover. Of course, that means either my king or queen will have to move next if he doesn't play Qxd4 to avoid a royal pin.} Qxd4 {Natural and safe, but either rook to e8 is lethal.} 22. Rd1 {Given the chance, this guy jumps in the action and threatens her majesty. I'm going to have to deal with a pin coming via Re8, but have the chance to eliminate queens.} Qb6 23. Kf1 {Pin avoidance.} Rfe8 24. Qd2 {Moving to safety and still entertaining ideas of assualting the kingside.} Re3 {! Nice....my king can only protect from g2, and protecting with my queen is way passive.} 25. Kg2 Rae8 26. h5 {Do or die time. My knight covers e2, so I'm safe for the moment there. My aim is to create as much chaos as I can with my kingside pawns with the idea of rooks up the h file.} Re8e5 {Preventing g5.} 27. f4 {I feel I just have to play g5, so this is necessary. My king is now exposed more than a nudist resort.} Re5e6 28. g5 {Finally, I get to play my "death move", and am promptly rewarded with....} Ne4 {....black getting a cushy post and the opportunity to trade down.} 29. Nxe4 {?! I took a little time with this one, as I feared losing my knight which covers e2. Then I realized that I may be able to gain enough time to play h6 or Rde1 next with hopes of finding a check to play. I simply don't analyze far enough ahead, and the resulting position he achieves after we exchange rooks is with check, leaving me even more totally demoralized than before. Did I mention that I hate my life?} Re6xe4 30. Rde1 Re3xe1 31. Rxe1 Rxe1 32. Qxe1 Qxb2+ {Three lousy moves....that's all I could see ahead. I consider vomiting and resigning (in that order).} 33. Kg3 {For gits and shiggles I decide to press on, and hope to somehow find a way to utilize my kingside pawn advantage. I mean, seriously.....it took so long to set up. It would be a shame not to at least try.} Qa3+ {It's interesting to note that this is the only square black can check me from. In doing so, he allows me to press forward with my king (which turns out to be nicely shielded). I regain a little hope.} 34. Kg4 Qf8 {Black realizes his queen is not exerting much influence on a3, and retreats her to a position of power and defense. Nice move.} 35. Qe5 {! Reaching the most active square for the queen. Threats abound once a pawn is pushed, and the black queen now appears to be hemmed in to a large degree.} Qc8+ {Untangling the right way, with a hard right to the jaw.} 36. f5 {It really is all or nothing for white. Down on material, but with immediate threats available and a king that can't be immediately checked, I start silently singing that song about an ant and a rubber tree plant.} Kh7 {Unpinning the king, but inching closer to danger. White decides to pull the trigger.} 37. g6+ {It suddenly occured to me that a grown man engaged in a contest of mental prowess really shouldn't be singing song about ants, rubber tree plants, and high hopes. I switch songs to Van Halen's 'Right Now', and pass the point of no return.} fxg6 {?! Kg8 was better. Black was probably counting on the fact that my f pawn is frozen, but this move allows the opening of the h file.} 38. hxg6+ Kg8 {Too late. White's king is safe, and he now has time to reach h7 or h8, with threats.} 39. Qh2 Qe8 {Desperately seeking a check.} 40. Qh7+ {Right NOW! Hey! There's no tomorrow......} Kf8 41. Qh8+ {Right NOW! C'mon, it's everything!} Ke7 42. Qxg7+ {Catch your magic moment!} Kd8 43. Qf6+ {Do it right here, and NOW!} Qe7 {Any king move and white forces a trade of queens and wins the race to promotion.} 44. Kg5 {! Not a position you see every day. Both queens are pinned to their mates by their counterparts. White is totally cool with that - if black takes white retakes and maneuvers to push the f pawn. If he doesn't take white plays g7.} d4 {He's running a marathon......} 45. g7 {....and I just have a short sprint. Black resigns, and I take my first serious deep breath in over an hour. I remember that I have just gone 4-0, and promptly try to forget about the way I almost just screwed the pooch. Later, in analysis and also as I write this, I attempt to somehow achieve catharsis regarding my own limitations as a chess player. While it is good to know that I can overcome blunders like 20. f3, my main problem is allowing moves like that to even enter my mind. Distractions, random thoughts, and for me even the wrong inner music (does anyone else do that?) all detract me from the board tourney after tourney. Lack of focus is the only reason I can't improve past my USCF high of 1514. That and the fact that I can't play OTB in my boxer shorts, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. Many thanks to Patrick B. for the fine game - you really pushed me man.}
