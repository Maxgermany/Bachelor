[Opening "Vienna (C26), Falkbeer variation"]

1. e4 {Annotating on behalf of my friend, for instructional purposes. He's playing white and opens with the Open Game.} e5 2. Nc3 {Vienna Game.} Nf6 3. d3 {Black replied with the Falkbeer variation (aka Berlin Defense). White has four main lines here. 3. f4 (Vienna Gambit), 3. Bc4 (often transposes into lines form Bishop's Opening or King's Gambit), 3. g3 (to fianchetto the bishop) or Nf3 (usually transposes to Four Knight's Game). White chose none of the above and played the passive 3. d3. This move gains no real advantage, blocking the king's bishop while opening the queen's bishop, defending an adequately defended pawn at e4, and not really gaining any ground in the center.} Nc6 4. Nd5 {White jumped out, violating a couple generic opening principles, like not moving the same piece twice (important), not crossing the center line of the board while still developing (generally useful but not mandatory, like with Ruy Lopez), and not attacking until you have several developed pieces to bring to bear (useful but not mandatory).} Nxd5 5. exd5 {White has doubled his pawns on the d-file. The farthest doubled pawn is usually the hardest to protect and often will be lost. Doubling pawns should be avoided if possible. The pawn on d5 does threaten black's knight, but that isn't much compensation for the weakness a doubled pawn brings.} Ne7 6. d4 {Black retreated the knight as expected and now threatens the advanced doubled pawn. White breaks a couple more opening principles by moving a pawn that already moved and by not developing more pieces. He also leaves his d5 pawn hanging unprotected.} Nxd5 7. Bc4 {Black gobbled the free pawn, and now white is attacking the undefended knight on d5. This move is a good one, it develops a piece to a good central square and does so with a threat. Although, it does violate one general opening principle: it's usually better to develop a knight before devolping the bishop next to that knight. However, this may be a case where breaking this rule is OK.} c6 8. Qg4 {Rather than retreat, black defended the knight. This might be a good time to capture that knight. That would leave black with doubled pawns on the d-file. Then after white plays dxe5, those doubled pawns will have no support of adjacent pawns (they will be isolated without pawn support) and further, they would be on a half-open file, vulnerable to white's rooks. But, it's not wise to exchange when behind in material. Still, doubling and isolating those pawns is an almost certain guarantee that white can capture one, and maybe both, sometime soon, regaining his lost material. Instead, white takes a gamble bringing out the queen early, and without making any overt threats.} d6 9. Qh5 {Black's move strengthened his center, defending the pawn at e5, and discovering an attack against the white queen by the black bishop at c8. White is forced to move his queen again (violating the principle to not move the same piece twice - this violation is forced, white cannot lose the queen, but it calls into question the wisdom of the original 8. Qg4 move that allowed black to force this violation). White chooses h5 for this queen. Not a strong location. The queen is the most mobile piece on the board, but from the edge, her mobility is seriously decreased. She wants to live in the center. From h5, she has 7 moves that will get her killed, 3 captures (pawns) that will all get her killed, and only 3 safe moves to f3, e2, or back home to d1, none of which threaten black in any way. Which means the white queen is highly ineffective at h5 - though she does put pressure on e5, combined with the white pawn on d4, black will need to do something to avoid losing that e5 pawn.} g6 10. Qe2 {Black chases the white queen back to her own camp where she belongs. White's three last moves could have been summed up with 8. Qe2, leaving him free to make other, developing moves on his 9th and 10th move.} Be6 11. dxe5 {I have to admit, I'm a little surprised that the d4/e5 standoff remained on the board for so many moves when at times, either side could have made a capture and gained a pawn there. I think black would have been better served taking advantage of his 9th move, 9. ... g6, by playing 10. ... Bg7, developing a piece and defending his pawn at e5. Or, he simply could have played 10. ... exd4 and solved the whole problem, gaining a pawn but doubling his pawns on the d-file and likely losing that d4 pawn in the future.} Qg5 12. Bxg5 {Wow. 11. ... Qg5?? deserves the double question mark. Black sends his queen into the slaughter, probably thinking he was forking two pawns, e5 and g2, but obviously overlooking white's bishop on c1.} h6 13. Bh4 g5 14. Bg3 {Black has succeeded in driving the white bishop to right where it wants to be, on the strong diagonal defending e5 and threatening bad things to come if black allows white to play exd6. Now it is time for white to start thinking about exchanging pieces off the board. He has a huge material advantage that needs to be exploited.} Kd7 15. O-O-O {Black saw the threat and prevented the loss of his d6 pawn. White castles and brings his rook to bear on a half-open file aimed right at the pressure point in the center.} Bg7 16. Bxd5 {Black's fianchetto adds more pressure to the center and white follows through with the idea of liquidating pieces to leverage his material advantage. However, he missed the fact that he could play 16. exd6 and gain a pawn since the black bishop no longer defends the pawn at d6.} Bxd5 17. exd6 {Now white plays 17. exd6 but it is a move too late. First he needed to see to the safey of his pawn on g2 and consequently, his rook on h1. I originally gave white's 17th move a ? since it seems to lose the exchange, but then after further analysis (see my note to move 18) I retracted the ?.} Bxg2 18. Qg4+ {This begins a neat little combo that has the potential to save white's rook on h1. 18. ... Kd8, 19. Be5 threatens black's bishop on g7. If black plays 19. ... Bxf5, white replies 20. Qxg2. If black plays 19. Bxh1, white plays 20. Bxg7 and now black saves his rook (20. ... Rg8, 21. Bf6 ), giving white time to play f3 to trap the black bishop on h1, then Ne2 and Rxh1, gaining two bishops for a rook and pawn - roughly even trade.} Kd8 19. Ne2 {But white missed the combination in my previous note and settled for losing the exchange. Not a big loss, considering his material advantage.} Bxh1 20. Rxh1 Ke8 21. Rd1 {Good move by white, retaking the open file behind his advanced past pawn.} Rd8 22. d7+ Ke7 23. Nd4 {White missed Bc7, threatening chasing the rook off of the promotion square. From here, he sets up a nice little fork on f5, forking the black king and the bishop on g7. Note that the white knight now obstructs the rook's defense of the pawn.} Rxd7 24. Nf5+ {Now black is in trouble again. The knight forks the king and the bishop. The king has to move, but he is the only defender of his rook - if he moves to defend the bishop the rook will fall, and if he remains near the rook, the bishop will fall. Black's king cannot save them both.} Kf6 25. Rxd7 {Black chooses to lose the rook, a questionable choice. White pounces while he can.} Rb8 26. Nxg7 {Black defended a pawn, not a bad choice since he cannot afford to lose any more material. White does the smart thing, well, a smart thing, and exchanges pieces, ridding black of one of his last two defenders - the other defender is off on the queenside babysitting pawns, so black's king is exposed and defenseless now. It's worth noting that black's move, 25. ... Rb8?? puts his rook directly en prise from white's bishop on g3. White would have been just fine playing 26. Bxb8. There is a quick checkmate here too: 26. Be5  Kxe5 27. Nxg7 any 28. Qf5# or 26. ... Ke6 27. Nxg7  Kxe5 28. Qf5# or 26. ... Kg6 27. Nxg7 Kh7 28. Qf5  Kg8 29. Qxf7  K-moves 30. Ne8#} Kxg7 27. Qf5 {Now white should get rid of that rook on b8, but evidently, he missed the long range attack. Not to worry much, queen   rook   bishop against black's lone king while his rook is too far away is still a winning attack, although that rook might foil some back-rank checkmates. The move as played threatens the pinned pawn on f7. Black has to lose it or defend it with his rook - which may be an argument for 27. Bxb8 and 28. Qf5 as a stronger attack. Truth is, black is cornered and cannot escape white's mating web.} Rf8 28. Be5+ {The perfectly logical continuation. Black is cornered and doomed, and 27. Rf8 saved the quick checkmate but also sealed black's only escape route.} Kg8 29. Qf6 {And now there is no escape.} Re8 30. Qg7# {Final position.}
