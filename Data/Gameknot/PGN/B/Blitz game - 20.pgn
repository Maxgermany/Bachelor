1. e4 {I mated my first 1968 on Pogo, but I've gone on to win many blitz games against 18,19, & even 2000's here at GK on Blitz brain. Which goes to show that chess players skilled at Correspondence chess aren't necessarily as skilled at Blitz chess!} c6 2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. h3 {pre-empting the Bg4 pin, which is ok in my book since black has no developed pieces yet.} Nc6 5. Bb5 {Attacking while developing is almost always favorable to non-attacking development.} Bd7 6. Nc3 e6 7. a3 {Likewise with the Bb4 pin} Nf6 8. d4 Bd6 9. Bg5 a6 10. Bxc6 bxc6 11. O-O h6 12. Bh4 {White retracts the Bishop to h4 in hopes of a kingside weakening pawn push of g5} g5 {success!} 13. Bg3 Bxg3 14. fxg3 Nh5 15. Ne2 {Defending g3} f5 16. Ne5 {Placing the Knight on an advanced post.} O-O 17. Nf4 {If NxN then white wins a pawn.} Nxg3 {Black chooses the free pawn and a simulteanous attack on the f1 rook.} 18. Nfg6 {White coaxes black into a seemingly innocent exchange except white is breaking into the enemy camp.} Nxf1 19. Qh5 {Trap! white sacrafices the rook for the initiative & kingside attack!} Kg7 20. Nxf8 { } Kxf8 {?! under the time pressure black lost track, 20...Qxf8 21. Qg6  Kh8 22. Nf7  Qxf7 23. Qxf7 also loses black's queen, but atleast holds out longer.} 21. Qf7# {## mate & the rook sacrafice was worth it.}
