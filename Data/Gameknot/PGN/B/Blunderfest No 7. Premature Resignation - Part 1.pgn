1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Does anybody get a sinking feeling when you think you have a lost game.  You wave the white flag and in a post-match analysis with your opponent he tells you there was a way out and when he does it seems so bally patently obvious.  Here is an old game against Coach Ion that only now can I bring myself to annotate it.  I play the Nimsovich-Rossilimo Attack of the Sicilian but guess who ends up on the defensive .........} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {3. Bb5+ - this is the start of the Nimzovich-Rossilimo Attack - this is about as aggressive as I get!} Nc6 4. O-O Bd7 5. Re1 e5 6. c3 {6. c3 - getting a bit like a Ruy Lopez.} a6 7. Bf1 {7. Bf1 - I suppose I was following the db here but I wonder whether Ba4 might have been worth considering here, transposing into a genuine Ruy Lopez.} Be7 8. d4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bg4 10. d5 {10. d5 - database recommends it but would taking on e5 been better?} Nd4 11. Nbd2 Rc8 {11. ...... Rc8 - threatening Nc2, nasty nasty so I play 12. Bd3 to prevent this.} 12. Bd3 Nf6 13. Nb3 {13. Nb3? - to free Fou Lenoir but allows an exchange on f3 busting up the position around King Henry.} Nxf3+ 14. gxf3 Bh5 {14....... Bh5 - maintaining a pin on f3.} 15. Bf1 Nd7 16. Be3 O-O 17. Bg2 {17. Bg2 - my bishops make valiant attempts to plug the holes.} f5 18. Qd3 {18. Qd3 - connects my rooks.} f4 19. Bd2 Bh4 20. Rac1 {20. Rac1 - contests the c file and creates possibilities of back row mates should Ion's heavies move off it!} Qb6 21. Qe2 {21. Qe2 - forced - to defend f2.} Nc5 22. Nxc5 Rxc5 23. Rxc5 Qxc5 {23. ....... Qxc5 - typical of jstevens1 - tries to exchange her way out of trouble, but there is still quite a lot of ivory on the board!} 24. Bc3 Be8 {24....... Be8 - heading for b5.} 25. Qc2 Bd7 26. Re2 {26. Re2 - defending f2.  Now comes a rook swinger to g6 pinning Fou Leblanc to Henry.} Rf6 27. a4 {27. a4 - to stop Bb5.} Rg6 28. Kh1 Qb6 29. Qd2 Qd8 {29. ....... Qd8.  Here I overlook the fact that Glenda has time to get to f3 to defend Fou Leblanc and wave the white flag. I used to resign in the pre-Freddy era when faced with unavoidable mate so here is one advantage of playing games out to mate - you avoid this scenario.   Although, notice, my a4 pawn is hanging and Ion has 2 chances to take it as Glenda has had to move away from its protection.  This would have left me with a very difficult endgame with my remaining pawn structure busted.  In those circumstances it was still worth playing on. Thankfully premature resignation on my part has been a very rare occurrence.}
