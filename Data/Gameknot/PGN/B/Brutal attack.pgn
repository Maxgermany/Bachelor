1. e4 c6 2. d4 {Here playing white on a Caro-Kann game.} e6 {Generally, black go directly with d5, but it still fine.} 3. f4 {?! Well I wasn't sure about what to play. I didn't like the idea to play c4 or Bc4. Nf3 could have been fine but I wanted a sharp opening.   Computer analysis: Inaccuracy: +0.12 » 3. f4 d5 4. e5 Nh6 5. Nf3 Na6 6. Nc3 Bb4 7. Bxa6 bxa6 8.

Weird manoeuver because the knight blocks the bishop; it's important if you want to castle as quick as possible. I think d5 was far more better, taking the center and giving space to develop the other pieces.  Computer analysis: Inaccuracy: +0.75 » … Ne7 4. Nc3 Ng6 5. Nf3 Be7 6. Bd3 O-O 7.

Black seems to have a preference for slow games.} 5. Bd3 {I wanted to castle as quick as possible to be able to advance my pawns. Bc4 could have been fine too, but after d5 6.dxd5 cxd5 7.Bd3, I think black have a stonger center and a lot of space to develop his pieces.} Qc7 6. Nc3 Nd7 {?! Black block the other bishop. No choice to move a pawn in the next move if he want to castle. I don't like black position at all, I think he has wasted some tempo in the opening and now he is going to have a hard time to keep developing his pieces. Seems like e5 is going to be black's next move.} 7. e5 {The idea here was to block black to have the e5 square and to give the possibility for my bishop to attack h7. Now I can make a fine attack on the king side and black gonna have a bad time to protect it since most of his pieces are in the queen side.} Nd5 8. Nxd5 exd5 {I think cxd5 would have been better here because it would have done a blockade to my pawns in the center.} 9. O-O {Now I can continue to push my pawns without problems. Black is so much under developed.} dxe5 10. fxe5 Be7 11. e6 {! The key move.} fxe6 12. Ng5 {Black will not be able to castle on this side. I'm going into a very sharp position.} Nf6 {! The only fine defense.} 13. Nxh7 {Taking back my lost pawn and giving access to my bishop or my queen to attack threats the king. If Nxh7 then 14.Qh5+ and I can take back with my bishop. It's a very sharp position. Bxh7 would have been more accurate.  Computer analysis: Mistake: +0.23 » 13. Nxh7 Kd7 14. Nxf6+ Bxf6 15. Bf4 Qb6 16. c3 Qxb2 17. Qb3 Qxb3 18. axb3 a5 19. Bg3 Rf8 20.

Kh1 {My queen seems to be in a very bad position but there is nothing to fear because my knight is too well protected and my attack is just too much strong at this point. } Qg3 {Black is in a very desperate situation and have no choice to sacrifice his queen if he want to survive longer.
