1. e4 Nc6 2. Nf3 e5 {Nimzovich defense. I'm playing white. I actually had no idea what this was called until I looked it up in the Openings DB.} 3. Nc3 Be7 4. Bc4 h6 5. O-O {Nothing special happening.} Nf6 6. Re1 {I move my rook out.} O-O {He castles.} 7. d4 {I threaten his pawn for control of center.} b6 {Not sure what he's doing here.} 8. b3 {I don't know why I didn't take that pawn.} d6 {He defends his pawn, it's too late for me to capture now.} 9. d5 {I try to stop his capturing my pawn, and gain control of the center.} Na5 {He wants my bishop.} 10. Bb2 {I let him take my bishop.} Nxc4 {He wants the trade.} 11. bxc4 {I take back.} a5 {He develops his pawns.} 12. Nb5 {Moving my knight out of my bishop's way.} h5 {He moves his pawn up.} 13. h4 {I move mine up too.} Ng4 {He moves his knight out of the way so he can take my pawn.} 14. Qd2 {I do not notice his attack on my pawn, and double my rooks up.} Bxh4 {He takes my pawn.} 15. g3 {I try to get his bishop out, and avoid a fork on f2.} Be7 {He moves his bishop back.} 16. a4 {I make way for my rook.} f5 {Trying to take my pawn off the center.} 17. exf5 {No choice there.} Bxf5 {He takes.} 18. Nh4 {I try to shoo his bishop off.} Bxh4 {Didn't see that coming.} 19. gxh4 {I take back.} Qxh4 {And he takes.

Ne6 {I move my knight out of danger only to attack his other rook.} Rf7 {Again, trying to get his rook out.} 23. Ng5 {Attacking again.} Rf6 {And again.} 24. Ne4 {And again, slowly gettting my knight to safety.} Rxc4 {Big mistake. He might not have seen that knight attacking his rook.} 25. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {I take and he takes back.} 26. f4 {Not sure why I did that, maybe to grab an open file for my rook.} Rxc2 {He takes a different pawn and forks me.} 27. fxe5 {I go threaten his queen.} Rxd2 28. exf6 {And he wants a trade.} Rxb2 {Ouch.

Kh4 {Move away.} Ra4+ {Check.} 46. Kh3 Ra3+ 47. Kh4 Ra4+ 48. Kh3 {I do not have much hope of a win now. I get a draw by three-fold repetition.}
