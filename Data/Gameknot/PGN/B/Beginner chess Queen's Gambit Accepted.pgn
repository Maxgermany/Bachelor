1. d4 {I am offering up this game annotation for two guys I've been trying to help out in learning to play chess.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 {Queen's Gambit Accepted.  It can sometimes lead to very exciting play.} 3. e3 {A more aggressive response is e4, making a more strategic push for the center, but this move open up the bishop going after the c4 pawn for early equalization.} Nf6 {This move doesn't seek to capitalize on the early pawn movement but does get your knight into the game.} 4. Bxc4 {A bit premature perhaps?  Another good option is Nf3, but there is nothing wrong with this move.} Bg4 {Early aggressive.  Unless you want to castle queenside, I would focus on less aggressive development.  I think e6 is a good response.  It blunts any light squared bishop attacks and allow the black squared bishop a path to development.} 5. Nf3 {I think that this is the best response.} e6 {Good development so far.} 6. Nc3 {I like h3 here better, but good for knight dev.  Also consider Nbd2.} Nc6 {A fairly routine development on both sides now.} 7. e4 {I would have chosen to castle here.  Get out of any potential danger.  This move is a mistake as it allows Black to win a center pawn.  Bxf3, Qxf3, Nxd4, threatening White's Q or what Black chose to do and Nxd4.} Nxd4 8. Qa4+ c6 {Now white has to be careful about b5 pawn fork.} 9. Ne5 {I am uncertain how good this move is, considering the threat of b5, you really need to hope black doesn't see it and that you can get your king to safety quickly.} Qd6 {I think I would have played Bd6 instead, as it achieves the same goal and develops the bishop, allowing Black to castle kingside.} 10. Nxg4 Nc2+ {Mistake.  In order to do this move you need to remove the defending queen first.  Much better is b5! or equalizing play with Nxg4.} 11. Qxc2 Nxg4 12. O-O {HUGE BLUNDER!  Qxh2 is mate (1)!} Nxh2 {Black does not have their eyes on the prize and missed a turn 12 Mate(1).} 13. Rd1 Be7 {Much better to Q to c7. Now you are trading a Queen for a Rook.} 14. Rxd6 Bxd6 15. g3 {Good to get rid of pesky knight.} Ng4 {Also consider Nf3+ for a free move.} 16. Bg5 Bc5 17. Rd1 Bxf2+ 18. Kg2 Bb6 19. Qd2 {Building pressure to threaten mate.} O-O {only move for safety.} 20. Kf3 {Mistake allowing free Bishop on c4.} Ne5+ 21. Kg2 Nxc4 22. Qd7 {Very aggressive, how will Black respond?} Ne3+ 23. Bxe3 Bxe3 {When you're down, trade pawns and not pieces.  Better to bring the bishop in first (if this is your play) to leave the knight.} 24. Qxb7 Rab8 25. Qxc6 Rxb2+ {Now, as they say, things are getting interesting.} 26. Kf3 Rb6 {Better to put Bb6 and then try to pin his knight against the queen.} 27. Qc7 Bg5 28. Qxa7 Bd8 {Big mistake.  Better to double rooks.} 29. Na4 {Mistake from White.  Rxd8 wins the Bishop for free.} Rb4 30. Qa8 {Mistake.  Black can response with Be7 to force White away.} f5 {Missed opportunity for sure as Black now cedes the game.} 31. Rxd8 Rb3+ {Besides giving up a rook for free, the best answer is that Black now has to exchange rooks on the back row.  } 32. axb3 Kf7 {Much better Rxd8} 33. Rxf8+ Kg6 34. exf5+ exf5 35. Kf4 Kh5 36. Rh8 {Better is Rxf5+, leading to mate in 2.  Either 1.	Rxf5+	Kh6 2.	Qh1+	Kg6 3.	Qc6#	  or  1.	Rxf5+	g5+ 2.	Rxg5+	Kh6 3.	Qa6#	} g5+ 37. Kxf5 Kh6 38. Qc6+ Kg7 39. Qf6# {}
