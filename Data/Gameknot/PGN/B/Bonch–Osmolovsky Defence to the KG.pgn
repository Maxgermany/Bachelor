1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 Ne7 {Known as the Bonch–Osmolovsky Defence, used by Bluvshtein to defeat Short in 2007. Surprising for a move in the KG, 3... Ne7 has hardly had a past, but interest has been growing in it. The idea is to meet 4.d4 with 4...d5 similar to the Modern Variation.} 4. Bc4 d5 {d5 is protected, and Black concentrates on the struggle in the center - avoiding weakening pawn moves to hold on to the extra pawn. White still maintains the initiative.} 5. exd5 Nxd5 {Centralising the knight and protecting the extra pawn.} 6. O-O {White wisely looks to keep the King safe and develop.} Be6 {Further protects the Knight to free up the Queen and blocks the e-file to the King.} 7. Bxd5 Qxd5 {Bishop takes wouldn't have gained anything - the Queen is safe to come out and then duck behind to defend the extra pawn.} 8. Nc3 Qf5 9. d4 {White's gained the fair share of the center, threatening d5.} c6 {I figured this was the way to get a grip on d5... but I was wrong. I'm open to any ideas here.} 10. d5 cxd5 {A mistake - allowing Nb5 with multiple threats. Better was Bc4 first and then to take to allow a quick castling to take the sting out of how the game continues.} 11. Nb5 {A great move by my opponent, threatening forks on c7 and d6. It took me quite a few minutes to find a way out without losing a rook, but at the cost of a fool knight.} Bc5+ 12. Kh1 Na6 {This way, both c7 and d6 are guarded from the knight.} 13. Nfd4 Qg4 {Offering to trade down the Queens.} 14. Nxe6 Qxe6 15. Bxf4 {And white has regained one pawn, and scrambled Black somewhat with the isolated pawn and Knight on the rim. Also possible was 15.Re1 Be3 16.Bxe3 fxe3.} O-O {Finally a break to castle.} 16. c3 {Another nice move, taking b4 from the knight and giving him nowhere to go.} Rac8 {I wasn't too sure what to play here, so figured I may as well look to grab the semi-open c-file. I wasn't sure whether the other rook should be on the e-file or d-file.} 17. Nd4 Qe4 {Trading would have just helped him bring the queen out and connect the rooks. I felt e4 was a nicely active square for the Queen where she couldn't easily be dislodged (for example if Re1 then Qxf4) without perhaps a trade (and the trade of knight for bishop now works better for Black).} 18. Nb3 {Looking to exchange off the bishop or perhaps reroute through d2 to kick the Queen.} b6 {Willing to trade the bishop and gain a post for the knight or perhaps regroup the center with the c-pawn.} 19. Qd2 Rfe8 {White has now connected the rooks, and Black will contest the e-file.} 20. Rae1 Qc4 {Necessary to continue to protect the weak pawn (the slight advantage Black has).} 21. Rf3 Rcd8 {I decided that the d-file was a better file for the rook - to better support the isolani and free the Queen. Looking back, I believe 16...Rad8 was better.} 22. Be5 {His Rf3 move suddenly became clearer - to build a threat at g7.} f6 {There are no alternatives I can see - g6 would have critically weakened the dark squares with a dark-squared bishop and queen on the board, Bd6 just hangs the bishop or mate.} 23. Bxf6 {And this I think is where White loses the game - looking for the bishop sac to tear open the kingside. A very enterprising idea, but it just didn't have the necessary followup this time.} gxf6 24. Rxf6 {The King is exposed at the cost of a bishop for a pawn.} Rxe1+ {However, White's firepower can be drastically reduced through trading off.} 25. Qxe1 Qe4 {Looking to trade Queen's with a potential mating threat on b1.} 26. Qg3+ Kh8 {And here White resigned - the attack has fizzled with Black up a bishop for a pawn. I feel the resignation may have been a bit premature but he was definitely disadvantaged. }
