[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The Advance Variation is having a good time in the 21st century, with the percentage of wins skewed in it's favour.} Bf5 4. Nf3 {The Short Variation is one of the best lines for White in this system.} e6 5. c3 Nd7 {5-c5 directly is also possible. However, the move played is better.} 6. Be2 c5 7. O-O Ne7 {Now, the standard responses for White are 8.Nh4, 8.Be3 and 8.dc. However, White played...} 8. Qb3 {I haven't seen this move before, so I call it the 'Mano Attack', in honour of my opponent.} Qc7 9. Na3 Nc6 {The first mistake. I should have played 9 - a6, 10.Nh4 - h5 with equality.} 10. Nb5 {Now White gets a slight edge.} Qb6 11. Re1 {An inaccuracy. 11.Rd1 is correct, retaining the small edge after 11 - cd, 12.Nfd4. } Bg4 12. Be3 Bxf3 13. Bxf3 a6 14. Nd6+ {A mistake, which allows Black to simplify to an ending with a slight edge. 14.Na3!? was correct, maintaining equality after 14 - Qb3, 15.ab3.} Bxd6 {Now Black has a slight edge.} 15. exd6 Qxb3 16. axb3 cxd4 17. Bxd4 Nxd4 18. cxd4 Nb6 19. Rac1 {A good move, disallowing long-castling, and discouraging Kd7.} Rc8 20. Rxc8+ Nxc8 21. Bxd5 Nxd6 22. Bf3 Kd7 23. Kf1 Rc8 24. d5 exd5 25. Bxd5 Rc2 26. Re2 Rc1+ 27. Re1 Rxe1+ {My second mistake. I overestimated my chances in the ensuing Bishop vs. Knight endgame, probably lulled by White's seemingly 'weak' doubled pawns. Correct was to retain the Rook, and try to create a second weakness in White's position. In other words, play on the Kingside. So, 27 - Rc5, 28.Rd1 - Ke7, 29.Ke2 - g5, 30.g3 - Kf6, retaining a slight edge, was correct.} 28. Kxe1 Kc7 {My third mistake. Instead of going for the doubled pawns, I ought to generate play on the K-side! Hence, 28 - Ke7, 29.Kd2 - b6, 30.Ke3 - Kf6 with equality, was correct.} 29. Kd2 Kb6 30. b4 Kb5 31. Kc3 h5 32. h4 Kb6 33. g3 Kb5 34. Bf3 g6 35. Be2+ Kc6 36. Kd4 Kc7 {A serious mistake. This attempt to prevent a Q-side infiltration only allows White fresh opportunities on the K-side. 36 - Kd7 was necessary, when White would retain his slight edge after 37.Bd3 - Kd8, 38.Kc5 - Kc7, 39.Bc2 - b6 , 40.Kd4. } 37. Ke5 {Now White's advantage is clear.} Kd7 38. Kf6 Ke8 39. Bd3 Kf8 40. f4 Ne8+ 41. Ke5 {White has managed to drive Black to passivity, thereby increasing his advantage.} Ke7 {41. - Kg7!? wouldn't have saved Black, as White wins by 42.Be4 - b6, 43.Bc6 - Nf6, 44.Kd6 - Ng8, 45.Kc7.} 42. f5 {The decisive move, breaking Black's K-side. Now there's no defense.} gxf5 43. Kxf5 Nf6 {Here, there were two other possibilities, both of which, however, loses:  A) 43 - b5, 44.Be2 - Nd6 , 45.Kg5 - Ne4 , 46.Kf4  -. B) 43 - Ng7 , 44.Kg5 - Ke8, 45.Be2 - Ke7, 46.Bh5  -.} 44. Be2 Ne8 45. Bxh5 Ng7+ {45 - Nd6  loses to 46.Kg5 - Ne4 , 47.Kf4 - Nd6, 48.Be2.} 46. Kg5 Ne6+ 47. Kh6 Nd4 48. Bd1 {A clever ploy to restrict my Knight by sacrificing a Pawn.} Nf5+ {48 - b6 would lose to 49.h5 - Kf8, 50.Kg5 - Kg7, 51.h6 .} 49. Kg5 {Not accepting the gift by 49 - Nd4 would lose to 50.Bg4 - Nc6, 51.Bc8 - Nb4, 52.Bb7.} Nxg3 50. Bf3 b6 51. Kf4 {I resigned the game here, acknowledging the superiority of the Bishop over my Knight. However, let's continue a bit further to see the winning mechanism of White.} Nf1 52. Be2 Nd2 53. Bxa6 Nb3 54. Ke5 Kf8 {If 54 - Nd2, then White wins by 55.h5 - Nf3 , 56.Kd5 - f5, 57.Kc6 - f4, 58.Kb6.} 55. Kf6 Nd2 {55 - Nd4 loses to 56.h5 - Kg8, 57.Bd3 - Ne6, 58.h6.} 56. Bd3 Kg8 57. h5 Nf3 58. h6 Kh8 {Black hopes to create swindles based on stalemate motifs.} 59. h7 Nd4 60. Be4 {The Knight has to be restricted from accessing c6 first.} Ne6 61. Bb1 Nd4 {61 - Nd8 loses to 62.b5 - Ne6, 63.Kf7 - Nc5, 64.Bc2.} 62. Kxf7 Nc6 {If 62 - b5, White wins by 63.Ke7! - Nc6 , 64.Kd6 - Nb4, 65.Kc5 - Na6 , 66.Kb6! - Nb4, 67.Be4!.} 63. b5 {Now, there's a straightforward win.} Nd4 64. Bd3 Nf5 65. Ke6 Ne3 66. Kd6 Ng4 67. Kc7 Ne5 68. Be2 Ng6 69. Kxb6 Nf4 70. Bc4 {And so, White wins after 70 - Kh7, 71.Kc7. 1-0.}
