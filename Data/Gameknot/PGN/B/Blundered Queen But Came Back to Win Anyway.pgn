[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C60), Cozio defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7 {The seldom seen Cozio Defense.} 4. O-O a6 {4.. g6 or 4.. Ng6 are the "book" moves, according to M.C.O.-13.} 5. Bc4 h6 {I assume Black feared 6 Ng5 d5, 7 Nxf7!? and the Fried Liver Attack.  Wouldn't want to be Black in a blitz game in that situation, but in a correspondence game it might be fun to test one's defensive prowess in that line.  } 6. Nc3 d6 7. d4 {7 d3 was also playable, but I reasoned that my best chance of exploiting Black's cramped opening was in opening lines of attack quickly.} exd4 8. Nxd4 Bd7 9. Re1 Ne5 10. Bb3 Ne7c6 11. a3 {In order to give my Bb3 a retreat square in case of ..Na5.} Nxd4 12. Qxd4 Qf6 {On seeing this I assumed Black's purpose was to castle long.  My initial reaction was that it was a weak move since 13 Nd5 would force the Black queen to retreat right back to d8.  And I went with that, oblivious to the huge tactical threat of Black's move.  } 13. Nd5 Nf3+ {Yikes!  There should be laws against moves like this.  The White queen is toast.  I thought about resigning, then saw that White gets almost enough material compensation for the queen.  In addition, I was way ahead on development.  Perhaps then, 13 Nd5 was simply the beginning of a very deep queen sac in which I had looked deeply into the position and analyzed numerous positive variations.  Yeah, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.    } 14. gxf3 Qxd4 15. Be3 {There's no rush for 15 Nxc7 .  The text develops another piece with tempo, and the c7 fork will still be there for the taking.} Qxb2 16. Nxc7+ Kd8 17. Nxa8 {And now I'm the equivalent of just a pawn down.  Further, all my pieces are developed whereas Black still has to get his Bf8 and his rook out.  My king position doesn't look so secure, but then neither does Black's.} Qf6 18. f4 Qg6+ 19. Kf1 Bb5+ {Of course, 19.. Qxe4?? would just blunder the queen back to White after 20 Bb6 } 20. c4 Bc6 21. Bc2 Be7 22. Nb6 {Yes, this hangs the e4 pawn (since I can no longer play Bb6  after the queen takes on e4), but I thought I could utilize the open e-file as compensation.  Also, knights don't really do a whole lot on squares like a8. } Bxe4 23. Bxe4 Qxe4 24. Kg1 {The White king has to take defensive matters into his own hands, since all the servants are otherwise occupied.} Rg8 25. Nd5 {Leaving some cheese on the trap.  Best now is probably something like 25.. Qg6 } Qxc4 {Black takes the bait.  It's easy to feel invulnerable when you have a queen and your opponent does not, but White is only slightly behind on material, and has an awful lot of development as well.  Black couldn't afford to open another line of attack for the White pieces.  } 26. Bb6+ Kd7 27. Rac1 {The Nd5 is of course immune to capture due to 28 Rc7  followed by either mate or the loss of the Black queen.} Qxc1 {Anything else results in either mate or the loss of the queen, noted in the last comment.} 28. Rxc1 {And now the tables are turned.  I'm up the equivalent of a pawn and have a great attack.} Ke6 29. Nxe7 Kxe7 30. Rc7+ Ke6 31. Rxb7 {The rest is mop-up.  Certainly not the result I envisioned after Black's 13.. Nf3 !} f5 32. Bd4 g6 33. Bg7 h5 34. Bd4 Kd5 35. Be3 Ke4 36. Rb6 d5 37. Rxa6 d4 38. Ra4 Rd8 39. Rxd4+ {Ending with a nifty little piece sac in order to transpose to a won king and pawn ending.  Moral of the Story:  Don't despair after a blunder.  Instead, take a deep breath and size up the positives of your position.  Sometimes those positives can add up and make you look like Tal!}
