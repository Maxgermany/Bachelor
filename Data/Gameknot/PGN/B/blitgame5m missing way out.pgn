1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 {I am not used to play queen pawn opening, and much less this apporach, but I saw it in one of the games damalfi played and commented, so I thought about trying it out (and against a 2044 rated!). Lesson: If you have no ideas of chess opening, you may want to learn first and then try things out. On the other hand, you learn by playing.} Nf6 {I wish I could comment on the defence, but, as mentioned, I have no idea. So let´s skip moves till middlegame.} 3. e3 Nbd7 4. Bd3 c6 5. Nf3 e6 {Now this starts looking like an slav defence, though I am not used to find WB on f4 when I play it with black.} 6. Nbd2 {I think it covers both sides in case you need to use the knight in on or the other flank. I am thinking about either supporting advance on c4 or play Nb3 after 6...Bb4; 7.c3.} Be7 7. c4 {Here we go. Maybe I should have waited, since I was considering taking the long castling in case black aimed for a short one. I still keep the idea to advance on the black king´s flank in case of castling, and even moving my own king to f1 in case of check (a long future one)} Nh5 8. Bg3 Nxg3 {This is a move I did not expect, since it seems to open a dangerous column on h. I am not sure about the quality of it, but definitively sets my mind on a shear attack on that flank.} 9. hxg3 dxc4 10. Nxc4 {Better than Bxc4. Now N in c4 has a strong jump point into e5, while Bb3 is still controlling the b1-h7 diagonal.} Nf6 11. Nce5 {Now even more clear to me. It seems to be a duel on knights controlling the centre, since I thought black can (in the future) jump onto d5. But now, BB in c8 is passive while its counterpart on the white side is still a pain... in BK neck´s.} h6 {With the idea to prevent Ng5.} 12. Ng5 {Which is still valid.} O-O {Now I started to spend time thinking on how to attack here. it seems a really sweet situation for white. But you really have to be a good player to come out with something profitable in a short period of time. Otherwise, you lose your time, and thus, most likely the game. I just thought how great would be to expel that N in f6. Any suggestions here are more than welcome!} 13. Ne4 {And this is all I got. Maybe Qc2 threatening to double team rooks on h after a long castling would have been more effective.} Nxe4 {So I remove that nasty defender, but black has now the possibility to counterattack, releasing pawns in "f" and then "e" columns, and opening a path for his Bc8} 14. Bxe4 Bf6 {Or bringing his bishop here, which is also good. Now, it seems we have reached a theme position here, but I cannot find the goldmine.} 15. Qg4 {It doesn´t seem good enough, but , as said, I cannot find anything better. Now I can think again about a long castling and bring the second rook to cooperate in the attack (although during the game, I did not think about that castling at all...). Maybe f5 would have been a nice alternative.} Bxe5 16. dxe5 {Nothing clear came after 16.Rxh6} Qa5+ {I did not foresee this simple time gained, bringing the big guns to support the defence.} 17. Kf1 Qxe5 {Now white really needs to do something strong in order to win the game. Playing defensively thinking about f5 does not seem like an alternative.} 18. Rxh6 {Now the threat is Rh8+, Kxh8 and then mate with the queen.} f5 {Here we go. I spent most of my remaining time here (and with the previous move) and came with...} 19. Qh5 {...sucha  wasted move. A classic example of "I have seen that if I move my queen to h5, my rook will be lost" and after a few more seconds, you cannot find anything and you seem to think Qh5 is a good one. But it is not.} gxh6 {End of story. If you guys find an alternative to 19.Qh5, please, let me know! I just couldn´t get even a draw position here.}
