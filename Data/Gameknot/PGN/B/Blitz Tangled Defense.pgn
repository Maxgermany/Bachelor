[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), classical variation"]

1. b3 {Larsen's Opening.} d5 {The classical variation; I believe 1...e5 is more popular. Now White will seek to prevent Black's ...e5.} 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. Nf3 d4 {!? There's only one game in the GK database with this move. More common are 3...Bg4, 3...Nf6, or even 3...f6 (supporting e5).} 4. e3 e5 5. exd4 {?! Probably 5.Be2 is better, as White's development is going to have some problems now.} exd4 6. Bc4 Qe7+ 7. Qe2 Qxe2+ 8. Bxe2 Bf5 9. d3 {?! 9.Ncd4 Nxd4 10.Bxd4 Bxc2 11.O-O is almost certainly better than this. Now the d-pawn will be hard to remove, and White's LSB is miserable.} O-O-O 10. O-O {Maybe 10.Nbd2 was better, first.} Re8 {White is technically "ahead" in development, but it sure doesn't feel like it. He only has one piece with any influence, whereas Black's three developed pieces are all contributing to the war effort. The goals at this stage of the game are simple: Black should finish developing and take advantage of his huge activity, and White needs to defend as best he can while trying to untangle his forces.} 11. Re1 {Better than 11.Bd1, I guess...} Bb4 12. c3 dxc3 13. Nxc3 {Maybe 13.Bxc3 was called for, to avoid getting stuck in this pin. The text does develop the Knight and connect the Rooks, at least, but even without the Black pawn on d4, White's pieces can still hardly move--they're all stuck defending one another!} Nf6 14. Bf1 {Freeing up the Rook to move out of its own pin...} Bg4 {This seems a bit weak. Given the opposite-side castling, Black could very well have started a pawn storm here with ...h6 and ...g5.} 15. Nd2 {Headed for e4.} Red8 {This doesn't appear useful; better was starting that kingside storm. White's d-pawn is protected by a Bishop with literally nothing else to do; it's not going anywhere at the moment.} 16. Nde4 Nd4 {Threatening to pick up an exchange with a fork on c2, and blockading the d-pawn. Black's pressure is really starting to ease up though; and White's pieces are finally getting a little less tangled.} 17. Rac1 Bf5 {Indirectly threatening d3. Black needs to get his other forces into action, though; a kingside storm is still indicated, especially with White starting to line up against the BK.} 18. Re3 {Reinforcing d3 and anticipating a need for kingside support. Also preparing to double Rooks.} Bc5 {?? And then tragically, Black overlooks White's Knight in the maelstrom in the center of the board, and blunders a piece.} 19. Nxc5 b6 20. Na6 {Aiming for b4, from which to support d3 as well as block up a6 and c6.} Kb7 21. Nb4 Nc6 {? Black probably ought not to be offering trades while behind, especially when White has the positional advantage as well--and *especially* not when the only way to complete the trade is by putting his King out in the open! 21...Ng4 looks interesting instead.} 22. Nxc6 Kxc6 23. Re7 {White offers Black the juicy d-pawn he's been eyeing all game, but at what cost? Black's King is hugely exposed, and White is threatening one weak spot in particular. Hint: it's not f7 for once!} Be6 {?? But Black thinks it is, and loses because of it. The best choice was probably 23...Rd7.} 24. Ne4+ {Now it's painfully clear where the pressure is. c7 is the target!} Kb7 {I'm pretty sure this position, with White to move, is mate in 7. Things get a little more interesting if Black goes for the gold with 24...Kd5; I don't see a forced mate in that line.} 25. Rcxc7+ Ka6 {25...Kb8 is insignificantly better (25...Kb8 26.Rb7+ Ka8 [26...Kc8 27.Rec7#] 27.Rxa7+ Kb8 28.Be5+ Rd6 29.Bxd6+ Kc8 30.Ra8#).} 26. d4+ {The LSB gets to participate at last!} Ka5 {26...Bc4 27.Rxa7+ Kb5 28.Bxc4+ Kc6 29.Rec7# or 28...Kb4 29.a3#. The text is more to the point.} 27. Bc3# {There you have it! Many thanks to wayn1 for an exciting game, and thanks for reading!}
