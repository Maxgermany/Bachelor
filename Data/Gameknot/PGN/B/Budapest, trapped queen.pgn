1. d4 {A Budapest, at last...} Nf6 2. c4 e5 {Finally I have the chance to practice this interesting gambit.} 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. a3 {Recommended by the database. It avoids the check and the subsequent doubled pawn, or a slight uneasiness in white's position.} Bc5 {This move seems to be good. It threats f2 while developing. } 6. e3 {The obvious and good answer. But it blocks the dsb. It has a good square in the future in b2, thoug.} a5 {This is a move with good GDB score. It sounds logical, since keeps the bishop on c4 preventing a possible b4 by white. Ok. It also preludes Ra6, Budapest feared move.} 7. h3 {Now, can someone explain why this move doesn't appear on the database? Since it has so many alternatives, I sweared nobody would hav played it. Me stupid. Ok, white recovers the pawn, but in which position?} Ngxe5 8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9. Qh5 {Now, how is it possible this position to be good for black? Still, where I dropped out the theory? I felt really betrayed by the GDB. I thought that the obvious d3 was too simple not to have been considered by white, so I decided to try to play aggressively.  I thought about Qf3, and I remember I found a refutation move by white, but I cannot remember which one. Of course, after Nc3, black has to cope with the possibility of Ne4. I considered white's b3, in order to get a good pin against my knight, and the possible tactic after Nd3+, taking the rook. Still, I didn't see a clear win, and white hasn't to play b3 inmediately. So I played Qe7, following one of the thematic moves of this opening, but looking hard where would it lead me to... } Qe7 10. Nc3 {Now, I won't allow Nd4, since it gives me an uneasy position. And I have to care about Ne4 too.  I made a not natural move: c6. My black bishop is free to move now after Ne4.  I have blocked my rook future action on the 6th row, and I have further delayed my developement.  It looks no good at all. } c6 11. Be2 {A plain, not aggressive move, just preparing castling.  But it has a disadvantage: it blocks the white queen's action.  I considered d6 (but it was as to say Qe7 had no point). Then, a4, trying to prevent white to develop his dsb on b2, but this position is so good for white he can easily let me take a4xb3! Then I considered g6, Qh6, but I cannot go on in chasing the queen... f5...? maybe. But maybe "chasing the queen" had another roads:  h6! I think, given the bad black position, it is a good move, since it threats g6, winning the queen! White has a few move here: g3, hoping to exchange queens on h4 (leaving him a direct hit on my kingside in trade of doubled pawns in the h file - but he can use those pawns for a future attack, so maybe it is a good trade for him. Maybe I can improve this, some way. Another move for white: Qf4 But in this case, I thought I could play d5, freeing my position a little.  } h6 12. O-O {An example of how a siimple move can be a disaster, since he didn't got the point of h6. And the game is over for him.} g6 13. Qxe5 Qxe5 14. Bd3 f5 15. Kh1 d6 16. Bd2 Bd7 17. Rfe1 O-O-O 18.
