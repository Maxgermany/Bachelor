[Opening "Guatemala defence (B00)"]

1. e4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 3. d5 {I haven't seen this opening played much in my games, so I decided to give the bishop as little room as possible.} c6 4. Nc3 c5 5. Bf4 {I've been in this position (or a variation of this position) in many of my recent matches, mainly to see how people choose to defend the fork.} a6 {This is the most common defense I've seen.} 6. Bd3 b5 7. Nf3 c4 8. Be2 Nf6 9. O-O d6 10. Nd4 Nbd7 11. Nc6 {Now things start to get interesting.  I decided to make a push to open up the board.} Bxc6 12. dxc6 Nb8 {After the trade, it looks like I'm going to lose my forward pawn, but...} 13. e5 {I counter-threaten his knight.  I was hoping (though not exactly expecting) 13... dxc5 14. QxQ.} Ng8 {He decides to retreat his knight instead.} 14. Bf3 Ra7 15. Nd5 e6 16. Nb4 d5 17. b3 Bxb4 {Here is where things started to go bad for me.  I didn't notice the discovered attack on my knight, so now I'm behind in material and have left my pawn unprotected.} 18. bxc4 bxc4 19. a3 Be7 20. Bh5 Nxc6 21. Qf3 {Here I was gunning for his rook.  I figured that I could bluff an attack while actually shooting at the rook, but it didn't quite work like that.} Nd4 {So much for taking the rook...} 22. Qe3 Bc5 23. Rac1 Nb3 {Now things go from bad to worse.  I thought that he would play 23... Nxc2 to fork my queen and rook, so I moved to protect the pawn, which unwittingly opened up for this attack.} 24. Qc3 Nxc1 {I thought about resigning at this point, but decided to keep playing and see what happened.} 25. Bxc1 Qh4 26. Be2 Qd4 {Now he starts looking to trade queens.} 27. Qa5 {I decline, because an even trade would have doomed me here.} Ne7 28. c3 {Now it's my turn to attack.} Nc6 {Now I have a glimmer of hope.  This move was a mistake.  An even trade would've killed me, but this is no longer an even trade.  Instead, he just gifted me his bishop.} 29. cxd4 Nxa5 30. dxc5 {Now material's much closer to even and I have a pawn behind his defenses. Good thing I didn't resign.} Nb3 {Now we start battling for the pawn.} 31. Be3 O-O 32. Bd1 Na5 33. Ba4 Rb7 {Again, I didn't like this move.  It made c6 the obvious move for me, and essentially took his rook out of his defense.} 34. c6 Rb2 35. c7 Ra2 36. Bd7 {Now, I can retake the material advantage with one move.  Just goes to show how quickly  games can turn from a losing position to a winning one.} Rxa3 37. Bc5 {Now he's lost either both rooks or the game.  At this point, my opponent resigns, and I was left in shock of how the game went.  Just another example to never give up!}
