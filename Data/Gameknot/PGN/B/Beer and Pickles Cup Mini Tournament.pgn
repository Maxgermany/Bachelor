1. e4 {My team captain suggested me to annotate some games,that is a good exercise.She suggested to annotate a lost game,to learn from my mistakes.But since this is my first annotation,I wanted to make a gift to myself,annotating a won game.Anyway I will learn a lot,since in this game made many mistakes,the worse one has been to miss a mate in 6!:( My opponent is more or less at my level,so the game has been difficult to both,and one of the more long I played here in Gameknot. I open as my usual. } c6 {He chose the Caro-Kann,likely not knowing that I was at that time playing a Mini Tournament with that opening,so that it was no so unfamiliar to me.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {Here I could have played 3.Nc3,but preferred the advance variation.} Bf5 {the more played} 4. Nf3 e6 5. Be2 Nd7 6. O-O Ne7 {we continued in the classical way} 7. Nbd2 {Nh4 was better?I preferred to develop the other knight} h6 8. c3 {I didn't understand his last move,and thought to defend the d pawn,and at the same time to open a way to the Queen } Bh7 9. b4 {Advancing pawns has to be a good thing,or not?} Qb6 10. a4 {That Queen has to be stopped!} a5 11. Nb3 {open the way to my DL bishop} axb4 12. a5 {hits the Queen} Qc7 {moves back} 13. cxb4 {now I can capture the pawn} g5 {I don' t think that move was good,since he had to keep the castle } 14. Re1 Bg7 15. Bb2 {Here I think there was a better move...but which one?Maybe Bb3?} O-O {Is this a safe castle?} 16. Nc5 {Here the computer analysis says inaccuracy,better Rc1,and I think,also playable a quiet move,like h3.} b6 {Also for my opponent the computer analysis is not good,better Nxc5} 17. axb6 Nxb6 18. Na6 Rxa6 {Here he gave a rook for a Knight} 19. Bxa6 {I took the rook,it was better to do it by my rook?} Nc4 20. Qb3 {Other mistake here...better Bc3} Be4 {Also mistake for the computer,it was better g4} 21. Bxc4 Bxf3 22. gxf3 {I think here it was better to capture by the Queen,even if strangely the computer didn't report mistake} dxc4 23. Qxc4 Nd5 24. Qc5 {It was better here Ra6?} Rb8 25. Ra7 Qb6 26. Rea1 {Here I can clearly see my mistake!Why I have not captured the Queen?} Qxb4 {He had here a good chance:26...Qxc5 27.dxc5 Rxb4 28.R1a2 Nf4 threatening Bxe5} 27. Ba3 {Here I missed Qxb4} Qd2 {Qb3 better,followed by 28.Qxc6 Qxf3 and the game was going to a draw I think} 28. Qd6 Rb3 29. Qd8+ Kh7 30. Rxf7 Nf4 {This has been a blunder,he didn't see that I could  mate in 6! 31. Rxg7+ Kxg7 32. Bf8+ Kg8 33. Bb4+ Kh7 34. Ra7+ Kg6 35. Qe8+ Kf5 36. Qf7# } 31. Qf6 {But I also missed it!!!:(:(:(} Nh5 {he threats my queen} 32. Qxe6 {But gave me a pawn} Qxd4 33. Qf5+ {an useless check,I had to move the other rook in c1,if he had captured my bishop,I moved Rd7 } Kg8 34. Rf8+ {here better Re1,and again,if Rxa3,Rd7} Bxf8 35. Qxf8+ Kh7 36. Qf5+ Kh8 {Kg7 better} 37. Qf8+ {and here Bb2} Kh7 38. Qf7+ Kh8 {38...Ng7 was best choice} 39. Bb2 Qxb2 40. Ra8+ {Rd1 was so difficult to be found?:(} Rb8 41. Rxb8+ Qxb8 42. Qxh5 Qf8 43. Kg2 {And Qg6?} c5 {he advances his pawn,but was not better Kh7?} 44. Qg4 {Again here Qg6!} Qe8 45. e6 Kh7 {better Kg7 I think} 46. h4 {More easy 46 Qf5+ Kg7 47.Qe5+ Kg8 48.Qf6 threatening 49.e7} Qe7 47. hxg5 {better 47.Qe4+ K7 48.h5!} hxg5 48. Qf5+ Kh6 {Kg7 better} 49. f4 gxf4 50. Qxf4+ Kg6 {His King continues to try something to safe} 51. Qe5 Qb7+ {A check} 52. f3 {I advance my f pawn} Qe7 53. f4 {it advances more} Qb7+ {Another check...} 54. Kg3 {...I go ahead with King too} Qb3+ {Another check} 55. Kh4 {My king continues to go} Qc2 56. Qg5+ Kh7 57. e7 Qh2+ {Another check} 58. Kg4 {At this point of the game I was pretty sure to win} Qg2+ {and dealt with his checks...} 59. Kf5 Qh3+ {...without concerns...} 60. Kf6 Qc3+ {Continues with check. } 61. Kf7 Qc4+ {Here he offered me a draw. I knew that English sense of humor is very cold... :) I declined it...} 62. Kf8 {And he finally resigned}
