[Opening "QGD (D07), Chigorin defence, Janowski variation"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 {The Chigorin defense- Black blocks his c pawn and relies on other methods to attack white's center, like Bg4 and maybe e5.} 3. Nc3 {The most popular move, although Nf3 is also very common.  Now cxd5 is a threat.} Nf6 {Black develops and defends d5.} 4. Nf3 {And White brings out the other knight.  This helps defend d4 in case of dxc4 by Black.} Bg4 {Black attacks White's knight and prepares to pin it if the e-pawn ever moves.  However, the move does weaken Black's queenside a little bit.  dxc4 is more common to stabilize the center.} 5. cxd5 {White takes advantage of the unstable center and gets pawns on both d4 and e4.} Nxd5 {Black recaptures the pawn and puts pressure on the c3 knight.} 6. e4 {And white grabs the center.  Black has no choice but to exchange some of White's pieces.} Bxf3 {Nxc3 is more common, as Black reserves the chance to save his bishop.  White gets doubled pawns but has a strong center.} 7. gxf3 {Recapturing the bishop.  Now Black has to decide what to do with his d5 knight.} Nxc3 {Exchanging another pair of pieces.  Nb6 has also been played, although White scored very well with his strong center and advantage in space. } 8. bxc3 {White's strong center compensates for his slightly shaky pawn structure.  If Black isn't careful, the pawns could advance and crush his position.} e6 {Black takes precautions against White's center, although the more aggressive e5 has been played more often.} 9. Rb1 {White takes advantage of the hanging b-pawn to move his rook to an open file.} Na5 {This is the unsound variation.  Rb8 is better and Black stays in the game, although White still has some advantage.} 10. Qa4+ {Taking advantage of the misplaced knight.  If Nc6? then 11.Rxb7 Qd7 12.Bb5 and White wins huge amounts of material.} c6 {Black thinks that he has everything under control.  He blocks the check and protects his knight at the same time.  However there is another weakness in his position that he has forgotten about- his uncastled king.} 11. Rb5 {!! Shattering Black's seemingly stable position.  This move threatens to win Black's knight.  To save the knight, Black must be prepared to allow his king to be hunted across the board.  Bd2 and Bd2 were played with reasonable success, although this move is in my opinion much stronger.} cxb5 {Black accepts the sacrifice Some other variations: 11...Nc4 12.Bxc4 cxb5 13.Bxb5+ is the main line except Black has already lost a piece 11...b6 12.Rxa5 bxa5 (b5 13.Rxb5 cxb5 Bxb5+ is similar to the main line but Black has lost a piece) 13.Qxc6+ Ke7 14.Ba3+ Kf6 15.e5+ Kg5 16.Rg1+ Kh5 17.Qe4 is a better (for white) version of the main line.  } 12. Bxb5+ {Black's king is forced into the open.} Ke7 {Nc6 13.Bxc6+ bxc6 14. Qxc6+ Ke7 15.Ba3+ Kf6 16.e5+ Kg5 17.Rg1+ (or maybe Bc1+) Kh5 18. Qe4 again similar to the main line.} 13. Ba3+ {Black realizes now that his king will have to take a walk.} Kf6 {Again forced and the future for the Black king does not look bright, although White's pieces are a bit far away.} 14. e5+ {Forcing the king to one of three squares, none of which seem inviting.} Kg6 {Probably the best square as the f-pawn could be used as a pawn shield.} 15. Rg1+ {The Black king is forced to the h-file. Not Kf5 16.Qc2+ Kf4 17.Bc1+ Kxf3 18.Be2#} Kh5 {This avoids all checks for the time being, but White can use a pawn sacrifice to switch the queen to the kingside. } 16. d5 {The threat is 17.Qg4+ Kh6 18.Qh3+ Qh4 19.Qxh4# Black cannot take the pawn either way. } Qh4 {Instead Black uses his queen to prevent the checkmate and threatens 17...Qxa4 18.Bxa4 Bxa3 winning.} 17. Rg4 {White shields his queen and attacks Black's queen.  } Qxh2 {Black takes a pawn.  Any other move with the queen would simply lose time.} 18. Bc1 {White now threatens Rg5+ and Rg2 discovered check, winning the queen.} Qxe5+ {Another moves are inadequate. 18...Be7 19.Rg5+! Bxg5 20. Qg4+ K anywhere 21.Qxg5# 18...Qh1+ 19.Ke2 Qxc1 20.Rh4+ Kg6 21.Qg4+ Qg5 22.Bd3+ f5 23.exf6 e.p.+ Kxf6 (Kf7 Qxe6#) 24.Qxe6#} 19. Be2 {Blocking the check and preparing moves like f4, threatening a discovered check.  Qxc3+ Kd1 only further misplaces the Black queen.} Be7 {If 19...g5 20.Rh4+ Kg6 (gxh4 Qg4#) looks to be a critical line.  I would appreciate help analyzing the position. } 20. Rh4+ {Another rook sac!  White clears g4 for the queen.} Bxh4 {Black finally gives up.  Declining the sacrifice was better, although 20...Kg6 21.Qg4+ Bg5 22.f4 looks winning for White } 21. Qg4# {And White finishes off the Black king.  Two rook sacrifices topped off with a nice mate.  A pretty cool game if I do say so myself.  Please comment and rate on the star system. }
