1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This game went on pretty quietly until my opponent allowed a tactical shot, beginning with en passant which won me a pawn.  My opponent gave me a speculative bishop sac on h3.  Unfortunately for him it backfired on him.  Again I ended up with a rook for two pawn advantage and an overwhelming position.  This time my opponent did wave the white flag.  Here is an analysis of the game:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15199128&rnd=0.23705641508714392} g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 {3. Nc3 - the opening moves have been the usual Robatsch Defense, which is g6 in response to e4.  Similar to the Sicilian Dragon, the black dsb rakes down on the a1-h8 diagonal.  I remember playing against the Robatsch against Coach Ion and getting floored by this bishop.  Here is the game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=10814415&rnd=0.5266001888457518} d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Be2 {5. Be2 - conservative development and I am not talking about David Cameron here!} O-O 6. O-O c6 7. a4 {7. a4 - this pawn will be the berserker but at the moment it is pretty innocuous.  This move was recommended in the DB as advantageous to white.  It does hold up the advance, b5, so I can see why it was recommended.} Nbd7 8. a5 Qc7 9. h3 e5 10. Be3 {10. Be3 - development.} Re8 11. dxe5 dxe5 12. Qd2 {12. Qd2 - preparing a possible forced exchange of dark square bishops to weaken the black castled position.} Nf8 13. Rfd1 {13. Rfd1 - preventing, for the moment, Rd8.} Nh5 14. Bc5 Nf4 15. Qd6 Qxd6 16. Bxd6 {16. Bxd6 - queen trade.} b5 17. axb6 e.p. {17. axb6 e.p - I very nearly forgot the en passant rule and moved Fou Leblanc to f1.  Luckily this time, before I pressed the submit button I remembered the rule and clicked reset and then took on b6.  Note that the a7 pawn is pinned against the a1 rook so I have won a pawn in broad daylight!} Bxh3 18. b7 {18. b7 - on the previous move black made a speculative sacrifice of his bishop on h3.  Before taking the bishop I saw that I would be able to win a whole rook by forcing black to give up his rook for Glenda and Fou Lenoir.  After Fou Lenoir gets removed from the board I then take on h3.  That little pawn on a4 really has gone berserk.  Here goes......} Rad8 19. b8=Q Rdxb8 20. Bxb8 Rxb8 21. gxh3 Nxh3+ 22. Kf1 Rxb2 {22. .... Rxb2 - I had to allow a black rook to go on my second rank.  However, I am not fazed by this as my own rook will either force an exchange of remaining rook or chase it off.  He goes for Plan B.} 23. Ra2 Rb7 24. Rd8 {24. Rd8 - I now try and turn the screw.  All my pieces are so well defended that black cannot take full advantage of the open lines available for a counter-attack.} Rc7 25. Ra8 {25. Ra8 - the black pawn on a7 will be picked off by one of the rooks and then my rooks will try and corall the c pawn.  Although I do not have many pawns on the board myself, remember, an extra rook is enough to win in an endgame.  My opponent decided that it was now time to wave the white flag.  I came sooo close to another missed opportunity.  I just hope I can continue to cash in.  Anyhow, another 6 rating points in the bag for me and a good day at the office - hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now.  Joanne}
