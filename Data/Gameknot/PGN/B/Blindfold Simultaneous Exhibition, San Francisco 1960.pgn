1. e4 {The master sticks to standard lines.} e5 {The amateur responds normally.} 2. Nf3 {The usual move nowadays. 2 B-B4 was standard until the middle of the 19th century.} Qf6 {What the...? That's why he's an amateur. This is the worst possible way to defend the pawn. I'd play 2... P-KB3 before resorting to this.} 3. Nc3 {Koltanowski continues his development.} Bc5 {If Black had played any other 2nd move, he could now follow up with 4... N-KB3 and prepare to castle into safety. } 4. Bc4 {Pressuring the tangled Black King-side.} d6 {Why wasn't this played on move 2?} 5. d3 {Opening a line for the QB to now come out.} Ne7 {Unnatural, but because of the second move there is no good square.} 6. h3 {To prevent ...B-KN5.} Ng6 {Cutting off the Queen's movement...} 7. Bg5 {...with disastrous results. The Queen is trapped and Black resigns immediately.}
