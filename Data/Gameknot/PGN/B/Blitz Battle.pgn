1. g3 {Not unusual for blitz but still makes it more interesting.} e5 {Black's  response more traditional. } 2. Bg2 {Naturally..} Nf6 {Planning to protect d pawn if it ventures out and its always good to bring out the steeds!} 3. b3 {Very hypermodern} Bc5 4. Bb2 {Traditional against modern, how will it end?} d6 {Pawn chain to protect from the bishop.} 5. e3 {Quite passive maybe he didn't want to block the lsb,or else planning to move to d4 next move to attack blacks stable pawn structure.} Bd7 {Black is not worried about that..} 6. Qe2 {Not sure why this is useful...} O-O {This is fairly self explanatory } 7. Nf3 {Hiding bishop but preparing to castle too.} Nc6 {At last the other Knight comes out } 8. O-O {Reasonable position for both sides...} Be6 9. Nc3 Bg4 {Preparing an attack...} 10. Na4 {Fighting fire with fire } e4 {Hoping for a nice fork there after 11...xf3} 11. Nxc5 {Oblivious to the obvious...} dxc5 {Black takes the Knight first as the other Knight can't escape or Bxe2 winning the queen!} 12. h3 {Not so good move for defense but hoping black will back off slowly..} exf3 {Not likely! } 13. Bxf3 {Protecting her Royal Highness but leaving h pawn exposed.} Bxh3 {Kings defenses don't look great at the moment } 14. Rfe1 {Couldve protected the rook with Bg2 } a6 15. a4 {Trying to pretend it never happened!} b6 {Black mistakenly leaves the Knight unguarded } 16. c3 {White didn't even notice!} Ne5 {Mistake..? Or trying to construct an attack on whites k-side ...!} 17. Bxa8 Qxa8 {Threatening ...Q g2# next move } 18. f4 {Easily defended but exposing the king.} Bg4 {Could have forked king and rook but black chose this instead } 19. Qh2 {There weren't really that many other options but this was the worst!} Nf3+ {Surprise! } 20. Kg2 Nxh2+ {No need to settle for second best, the queen was waiting to be taken} 21. Kxh2 Qf3 {Moving in for the kill...} 22. Ref1 {Not enough for white to correct himself...} Qe2+ 23. Kg1 {King must retreat} Ne4 {Black is protecting from 24.Rf2 and also lining up for further attack.} 24. Rae1 {Trying to push the powerful lady out the way} Qxd2 {A bonus +1 but material is no longer priority } 25. Bc1 {White doesn't know how to treat a lady!} Qxc3 26. f5 {Blunder!} Nxg3 {The score for  Black is +10 but position is invaluable } 27. Rf2 {Biggest. Blunder. Ever !} Qxe1+ {The game is drawing to an end but white doesn't resign.} 28. Kg2 Ne4 {Improving postion and attacking} 29. Rc2 Qg3+ {Now the rook is out the way the win becomes increasingly obvious } 30. Kf1 Bh3+ {Forcing king to e2...} 31. Ke2 Qf2+ {All pieces are in place for the finale.} 32. Kd3 Rd8+ {Black brings out the quiet rook for a strong role in the victory } 33. Kxe4 {White takes the Knight but this is fatal.} Qxf5# {Game over for white ..
