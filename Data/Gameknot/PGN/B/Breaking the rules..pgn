1. e4 {I won't comment the first moves, since they are already well commented in previous annotations. } d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {Typical Icelandic setting. If you know me, you know I like to play it, specially in blitz games, to make them funny. The opening doesn't hold against a good player, unless he just doesn't know it and possibly never played it, so it gives certain chances. My opponent obviously doesn't know it, so he goes for...} 5. Bb5+ {Not necessarily bad. Black can shield only two reasonable ways. } c6 {I choosed this over Ne7 because of the tempo gain. My N will develop through e7 anyway. } 6. Ba4 Qe7 {The Icelandic attack (not gambit anymore... :-), easily parried by white with Qe2. } 7. d3 {? Understandable mistake. No beginner can easily expect my next move...} Bb3+ {... and white loses a bishop. But... (the show isn't over yet)} 8. Qe2 Bxa4 {?? Big mistake. I should have exchanged Qs while I have the chance, then taken on c2, and lost three moves saving the B and putting it on a6. Now white can easily try to trap my B with c4!, and I'm forced to play c5 in order to save it after b3 and a4. } 9. Be3 {Sensibly, my opponent follow the principle than when down, don't exchange. } Nd5 {I played this on purpose, giving him the possibility to effectively trap my B in. After 10. c4, NxBe3, fxe3, b3 traps the B, and no use Qb4+, f6, and black has the counterthreat Bc4+ (disc), winning the BQ. This was surely not so easy to see on a blitz, so...} 10. O-O {...was very sensible, even if it missed a good chance. Seldom there is a position in which there is nothing more important or aggressive than castling. The important thing about castling is to be able to do it, not actually doing it. But this time was very good, indeed: now I have to be very, very careful in my developement plan, because of my QK alignement. My Bf1 is closed in, and I have to find a way to castle. My advantage piece is not easy to feel right now. } Nxe3 {? A counterdevelopement move, not good. But I looked for exchanges, wanted to keep the B pair, and possibly swap Q. } 11. Qd2 {??? Just a blunder, which takes interest away from the game. A pity. But wait. The show is not over yet. } Nxf1 12. Kxf1 c5 {?? This was a profilactyc move. I'm not interested in delicate play, I just want to finish the game soon... and I started to play very lightly. This move was an example. I have a one-move rest before the Ra8 threats my lined Q and K. What will I do? I couldn't see the dangers I was about to face. My turn. } 13. Nc3 {...being that the N threats my B. This means goodby to the B pair, but a good plan to remove the Q from her awful place. } Qd7 14. Re1+ Be7 {Well, my B is out. Now it will be a headache to castle, since Nc6 can't be played or NxB. Am I +7???? I can't believe this! :-). I think that I must have given a longer look to Kd8, out of the R's reach. } 15. Qe3 {Good, pressuring e7, but very, very bad for letting c2 unguarded. Qe2 was strongly better. } Bxc2 {it seems good, since now I threat Qxe6+ and I can greately release white's pressure. Now the game becomes interesting for the second time. BUT this move costed me the control of b5 after white's next (good!) move. I didn't see it, either. This will deserve a ? at least on a serious game. } 16. Ne5 {Protecting e3, and attacking the Q. When my Q moves, white's N will be able to jump to b5, threatening c7. This will be hard to meet, since I have no time for the simple a6. I am +8, but I am going to lose a lot of material, due to my ligh play (no Q's exchange, NxB and c5). Q can go to f5 or...} Qd4 {I expected here a Q's swap, followed by Nb5, and I can't prevent a K-R chek fork. I'll still be up in material, but... wasn't I supposed to win?} 17. Qe2 {White follows the sacred principles, and avoids the Q's exchange, while threatening my poor lsb, which has no square to go until the N covers e3. But here (my tactic excercises work, believe it or not), I had an idea. } Nd7 {It seems innocent, but if white takes my B, I'll take his N. It would be the best outcome for white. Specially because after QxB, NxN, Nb5 was still possible, and black has to move the Q, allowing RxN or Nc7+, and maybe more. My N's move wasn't any good, black still has a potential heavy material win here... if seen. Would you? He didn't. So, even more innocently, white went for the reverse order:} 18. Nxd7 {Wow! It seems SOOO good! It threats Qxe7#, and the only defence seems to be QxN - saving the dsb - after which QxBc2 will give white a breath and a hope. But...} Bxd3 {! A freezing move my opponent didn't expect... We are so used to mechanic retaking that often we miss nice tactics based on "crazy" - meaning "off the normal lines" moves. The fact that the N's defence of e3 was so important was seen when deciding for Ne7, and this was for the tactic training. I could focus the problem: how can I get the N out of there and take advantage of it...as soon as possible, thus not retaking when I am supposed to do ti...} 19. Qxd3 {Not the best (Nf6+ scrambles my pawnsat least, and Nxc5 wins back a pawn. Nb5 is not possible anymore, and with it all white's chances to create countergame. } Qxd3+ {Sensibly, my opponent resigned. I hope you didn't find all this too talkie or too "naive". }
