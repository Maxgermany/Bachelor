1. d4 {I play Black in this quick play game. I wasn't really focused on the opening and was trying some barmy ones to see what happened. } d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {I attack d4, hoping it will get me some tempo later on.} 3. e3 e5 {White defends and I bring up a pawn, which is not defended and white takes advantage.....} 4. dxe5 f6 {I can not take it so I bring out another pawn, thinking I can gain some position} 5. exf6 Qxf6 {A pawn down and in a good position.} 6. Qxd5 {I think this is where white loses the game, I lose a pawn, but I gain a huge amount of tempo } Nge7 {Attacksthe Queen and defends the other knight. } 7. Qh5+ {Quite a blunder, allowing me to develop further.} g6 8. Qg5 {Perhaps sensing that I am gaining to much position, white attempts to make his 2 point advantage decisive with a queen swap. If I take the Queen white also has a strong knight on g5.  I want to keep the attack on b2 as it is essential to my plan! However I give him what he wants with...} Bg7 9. Qxf6 Bxf6 {White has his queen swap but I have the development} 10. Be2 Be6 {white attempts to catch up} 11. O-O Nb4 {I now start my attack, not sure how it will go!} 12. Bd1 {I was hoping for this, I couldn't see any alternative for white in hindsight, but white has such stunted development I am happy.} Rd8 13. h3 {I am not sure why white does this now, there was no pressing threat on the back rank and it allows me to win the game} Rxd1 {White assumes the rook defending the bishop will be enough, then sees his blunder} 14. a3 {Tries to push the knight away and at the same time giving his rook what he thinks is an escape square (but for Be6)} Rxf1+ 15. Kxf1 {I swap the rooks and gain parity on material} Nxc2 16. Ra2 Bxa2 {White resigns. Don't bring your queen out early and you don't need to rake the kings side and raking bishops don't need to attack the kings sideto be effective!}
