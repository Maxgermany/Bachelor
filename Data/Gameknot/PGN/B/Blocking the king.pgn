1. e4 d5 2. e5 {I always move to e5 by force.} e6 {e6 blocks the c8 bishop moving on to the diagonal. } 3. Nc3 Nd7 {Normal structure but the knight blocks the black bishop even more} 4. d4 {I can make that, can't I?} Ne7 {?? It reamins leaving the king, queen and the other two bishops stuck. One check could easily do it. Bb4 would have been a whole lot better} 5. Nf3 {Developing} h5 {Hmmm...} 6. Bd3 {Preparing to castle} g5 {??} 7. Bxg5 {Bxg5 also pins the knight on e7.} Rh7 {Oops, you've made a terrible mistake!! A very easy-looking blunder...} 8. Bxh7 {A tool for not looking properly} f5 {Not too good looking!} 9. exf6 e.p. {Takes en passant! I could be wealthy now!!} Nf5 {Black has made a serious mistake which involves losing his queen. } 10. f7+ {See what I mean?} Kxf7 11. Bxd8 {And white remains a queen and rook ahead, and including pawns, 15 points ahed. White will easily win after that pawn sacrifice.} Bb4 {But now the bishop pins my knight. I don't want to end up with a doubled pawn....} 12. Qd2 {....so I move Qd2} b6 13. a3 {Aha, to chase the bishop away.} Ba6 {Oh.} 14. Bxc7 {Mmmf. The bishop on b4 is under attack.} Be7 {And the bishop returns.} 15. Ne5+ {Good.} Nxe5 16. dxe5 {Just as I expected.} b5 {Now my bishop can move! So Rc8 will be no help at all for Black!} 17. Qd3 {Chasing the knight away.} b4 {So..?} 18. Nb5 {Lookin' good.} Rg8 {I don't think a rook for a bishop in this situation might be a very good idea.} 19. a4 Ng7 {Good thing the knight's popped away and even better, he's blocked the rook, so at least I can do waht I planned.} 20. Qg6+ {Qg6+} Kf8 21. Nxa7 {Knight's on the rim are dim, but I just wanted to resit trying. Anyway, I'm 17 points up.} Rh8 {And the knight couldn't move because Qxg8 was checkmate, so much better from now on} 22. Nc6 {Attacking the bishop.} Bh4 {So he moves, but not to a very good square though} 23. Bd6+ {Here's what I mean.} Be7 24. Bxe7# {Easy as a pie and the game is won, with me being 20 points up.}
