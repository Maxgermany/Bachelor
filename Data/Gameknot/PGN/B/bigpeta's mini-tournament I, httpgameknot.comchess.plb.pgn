1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 d5 {Bad move. get your N out 1st and protect e5 } 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Nxe5 Nxc3 6. dxc3 Bd6 {Pins blacks own B against his Q.  Better was Qxd1+ exchanging Qs or Qf6 attacking the N and protecting f7 } 7. Nc4 Be6 {Good developing move putting the Bs on adjacent diagonals which is strong } 8. Nxd6+ {Aggressive breaking the B pair } cxd6 9. g3 Nc6 10. Bg2 {A note here for those who like to play the fianchetto. - Complete it as soon as you can unless you have good reason not to } O-O 11. Bf4 {Maybe not the strongest move but it does align the Bs } d5 {Slightly better was Qb6 getting the Q active and connecting the Rs } 12. O-O a6 {Seems like a pointless move. Better was Rc8 or Re8 getting a R active on a semi open file } 13. Qc2 {Possible alternative was Qb3 threatening Qxb7 and removing the N protector and creating a semi passed c-pawn } Rc8 14. Rfd1 Re8 15. Qb3 Ne7 {Blunder simply blocks in the R and takes the N out of the game. Better was Na5 protecting b7 and attacking the Q } 16. Qxb7 Ra8 {Putting the R back to bed? Stronger was Rc6 defending a6 and threatening Rb6 trapping the Q. } 17. e4 Qc8 {When you are behind dont offer to exchange pieces. Agressive would have been Bg5 } 18. Qxc8 Rexc8 19. exd5 Bd7 20. Rac1 {For those who like a frisson of danger then Bc7 was tempting black to take RxB. Then follows d6 Rc8 dxN threatening all sorts of mayhem on the back rank } Rab8 {simply gives away a R??? correct was Ng6 covering against a back rank mate and attacking the B } 21. Bxb8 Rxb8 22. c4 Rxb2 {If i was worried about Rxb2 i would not have left it en prise. Better was Bg4 attacking the R } 23. d6 Nc8 24. c5 {And the bulldozer rolls in. }
