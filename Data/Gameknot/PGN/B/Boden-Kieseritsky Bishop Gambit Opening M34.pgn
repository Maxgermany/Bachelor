1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {Today I try for the first time a Bishop Opening after reading a little about the Boden-Kieseritsky Bishop Opening, which of the various flavors of this opening appeals to my style of play. } Nf6 3. Nf3 {Offering the e4 pawn is part of this gambit opening. Interestingly, Hiarcs9 calls this a Petroff, which admittedly it does resemble, but I know it from books as a Boden-Kieseritsky Bishop Opening, and that is my strategical concept. } Nxe4 4. Nc3 {Continuing the opening by offering an exchange of knights. } Nxc3 5. dxc3 {Last move of this opening AFAIK, where the d pawn captures so to enable lines for the queen and bishop. } Nc6 {In a game I reviewed recently the best move suggested was ...f6, but the text move seems reasonable to me because I could not envision a good conclusion to an immediate bishop sacrifice at f7, or any other immediate problems as a result of this move. } 6. Qd5 {!? Playing the gambit with maximum adventure! } Qe7 {Prevents mate, and is the best move, not (6...Qf6 ?? Bg5 !) losing the queen. } 7. O-O {Activates the rook, safeties the king. } d6 {A good move which activates a bishop which will be used against the queen. } 8. a4 {I presume ...0-0-0, and so push for an attack here. Not so worried about a bishop exchange, and there is a small threat to b7 which can be plied. } Be6 {Hiarcs9 considers this postion a little better for black, and maybe so, but the game is not static and fluctuations will change the landscape. So ultimately it will be a matter of the best applied strategy. } 9. Qb5 {?! At best a threat of an attack, but the queen is still tied to the bishop and so no tactics will prevail. } O-O-O {?! Seems like BxB is better to remove some building threats. Hiarcs9 offers some alternate suggestions, but none improve the position dramatically. } 10. Be2 {Keeping the bishop in play. } d5 {Taking control of the center and opens a queen line. Enables ...Qc5. } 11. a5 {!? Continuing with the attacking plan. Not so worried about ...Qc5, can play Qa4 if necessary. } Kb8 {?? Giving up tempo, probably due to (12.a6) with threat of mate at b7, but better is (11...a6) which stops the pawn and the immediate mate threat. Hiarcs9 supports my analysis, we both give the same evaluation. } 12. a6 {! Creating a cascade of threats, not all of which will be countered well. I give this move a strong rating because of the potential that is developed by it. Here Hiarcs9 considers the position to shift slightly in favor of white. } Bc8 {Forced becuase of mate threat, or loss of knight. } 13. axb7 {This seems the best option because it cracks the castle, forces a pin on a piece, keeps black from obtaining a developing move. } Bxb7 {Staring at this postion I know I am a pawn down, in a slightly akward attacking position, have a consideration of preventing ...Qc5, and need to close on the king sucessfully while activating more pieces into the attack. } 14. b4 {! Prevents ...Qc5, to limit supporting pieces for the king. Keeping the queen out is priority since it is the most active piece for black and has the most opportunity to thwart my plans for conquest. } e4 {?! Better would be d4! to threaten Qxb4 after eliminating the c3 pawn. The text move creates an attack on the knight, but it does not improve the position for black really. Hiarcs9 evaluates this as slightly better for black, but I know different because I will now route the knight to a very useful attacking position at a5. } 15. Nd2 {With the idea of bringing the knight to a5. } Qf6 {Simply attacking a weak point, with hopes of forcing a positional concession by white to compensate. } 16. Nb3 {! Sacrificing a pawn for the greater good of the attack! Hiarcs9 evaluates as slightly better for white, but this knight is integral to ripping open the position and enabling a good attack on the king. Any sacrifice that offers good compensation should get a good rating. The compensation follows a few moves later. } Qxc3 17. Na5 {After exchanges black suffers from positional weaknesses which are exploited in the attack. } Nxa5 18. Qxa5 {Hiarcs9 gives no change of rating, still a little better for white, but white has all the positional trumps and black can not prevent the incursion on the king position. } Qxb4 {?! Does not seem to be a great move, perhaps made to keep the queen nearest the action. I like (18...Bxb4) better because it enables tied rooks. Hiarcs9 considers this move a blunder, but I think that a little strong or shortsighted because when the ensuing postions are evaluated it is noted that controlling a4 is good for black. } 19. Qxa7+ {Here Hiarcs9 shows white as winning, which is true, but mate is not possible just yet. } Kc8 20. Bg4+ {To force a material concession. } Rd7 21. Bxd7+ {Forcing a positional concession by bringing the king out into the open and taking support away from the b7 bishop. Hiarcs9 suggests 21.Be3, which is nice and leads to all kinds of complications for black, who does not fare well in any of them. I however did not consider the move in depth and so the text move is played. Alternative variation: 21. Be3 c5 22. Bf4 Kd8 23. Qb8+ Ke7 24. Qe5+ Kd8 25. Bxd7 Kxd7 26. Qc7+ Ke6 27. Ra7 e3 28. Rxb7 exf2+ 29. Kxf2 (29. Rxf2 Qe1+ 30. Rf1) 29... Qd4+ 30. Kg3 Qc3+ 31. Kg4 h5+ 32. Kh4 Be7+ 33. Bg5 Bxg5+ 34. Kxg5 } Kxd7 22. Ba3 {! Hitting hard to force the queen into a lesser position. } Qb5 {?! Trying to prevent Qa4+, but the position is not a good one for the queen. Hiarcs9 considers this a blunder, and that may be true. Black attempts to prevent Qa4 check, but suffers for it. } 23. Rfb1 {! Proving the weakness of the queen on b5. A strong move which kicks the queen, leaving the bishop undefended. } Qc4 {Still trying to prevent Qa4+. } 24. Rxb7 {Qxb7 was also possible, but my intuition, if there is such a thing for us non grandmasters, seemed to point me to this move. } Bxa3 {Black in a positional conundrum sacrifices material in an attempt to stave off mate by activating the rook. } 25. Rxa3 {This move appeals more than Qxa3 because the queen is participating in the threat at c7, and because this move has no detractors like immediate back rank mate. } Qxc2 {Threatens mate in one. } 26. h3 {! Refutes mate without losing positionally active pieces. } Rc8 {Trying to hold the position. } 27. Rab3 {! Frees the queen for operations, epecially Qa4+ which is now possible. } Qc1+ {Desperation. } 28. Kh2 Kd8 {Avoids Qa4+, The king is in danger of check and this move prevents it. Hiarcs9 considers it a blunder, and offers ...Ke6, which seems an interesting move. } 29. Qd4 {! A positionally active placement which offers all kinds of good attacks. A strong centralized queen. } Qg5 {Protects d5 and g7 from the queen attack. } 30. Rb3b5 {! Threatens Rxd5+ to gain the queen with check. } c6 {Forced, because of the check and queen grab threat. } 31. Qb6+ {Forcing concessions no matter the choice of blocking or moving the king. } Rc7 {?? Loses fast, better is ...Ke8, but even that will not save the game for black. } 32. Qxc7+ Ke8 33. Qxf7+ {Much better than (33.Rb8+) because that is blocked by (33...Qd8). } Kd8 34. Rb7b8# {Finishing with a linear mate, but Qd7# was also possible. I played this opening better than I thought I would. I like the positional play and opportunities for theatrical tactics in this opening. A won game because of some weak choices by black and some reasonably clever positional and tactical play on my part. }
