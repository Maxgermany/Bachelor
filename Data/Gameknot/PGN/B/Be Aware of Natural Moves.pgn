[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 e6 {an elastic move which leads to several possibilities of transposition} 2. Nf3 f5 {perhaps not the best choice in this situation because white can play e4. So if black isn't afraid of e4 why he didn't play 1...f5? Matter of taste} 3. e4 fxe4 4. Ne5 {More precise was Ng5. On e5 the knight just loses a tempo and in my opinion is completly illogical because now the main idea connected with f3 is not possible.} Nf6 {defending the material advantage and obviously preparing to castle king side} 5. f3 {Perhaps white hopes to exploit its edge in development...but does he really can boast such an advantage?} d6 {no } 6. Nc4 exf3 7. Qxf3 Nc6 {before castling black prefers to put pressure in the centre} 8. c3 Be7 9. Bd3 {Knowing how the game ends i should consider this move a blunder. Probably more precise is Be2.} O-O 10. O-O d5 {The idea behind this move was simply gaining more tempi forcing the knight and the queen to move and to create an isolated pawn as we can see in this sample variation: 11.Ne5,Nxe5; 12.dxe5, Ne4; Probably is also good 10....e5; 11.d5, e4; 12.Bxe4, Ne5; 13.Nxe5, dxe5; and black's pieces are extremely active. } 11. Ne3 {If we can't consider 9.Bd3 a blunder i feel confident that in this case we can. Withdrawing the knight is absolutly wrong. Now i think that white position is already lost.} e5 {A break in the center is always a good idea when your pieces are strongly placed. Now the Bc8 can enter in the struggle. It's hard to find a good reply for white. 12.Qd1, exd4; 13.cxd4, Nxd4; 14.Bxh7 , Kxh7; 15.Qxd4 should be still in black favour. But probably is the best because other queen moves let black gain another pawn without compensation.} 12. dxe5 {Yes white really played this move! It's clear now that after Nxe5 black's initiative is overwhelming.} Nxe5 13. Qe2 Bg4 {Probably best is Bc5 and move by move becomes clear that white's pieces are misplaced.} 14. Nxg4 {this is the ultimate blunder. Now white can't avoid the collapse of his position. Relativily best was 14.Qc2, Bc5: 15.Kh1} Nfxg4 {Nexg4 is less precise. The other knight keeps pressure on d3 and brings a threat of second order on f2. Notice how the Be7 too is ready to attack f2} 15. Bf4 {any move loses here. I can't calculate a decent variation for white} Bc5+ 16. Kh1 Qh4 {Mate threat. Try to imagine what could happen after 17...Rxf4; or 17...Nxd3; This is the reason why i say that 9.Bd3 is probably a mistake but who could tell it on 9th move?} 17. g3 {the only one. Bg3 simply fails to: 17...Rxf1 ; 18.Qxf1, Qxg3; 19.hxg3, Nxd3; and black gives mate or takes back the queen} Qh3 18. Nd2 {white has no moves. } Nxd3 {And white resignes. Notice the fire on f2.}
