[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The Advance Variation.} Bf5 {The standard response, developing the lsb outside the pawn chain.} 4. Nc3 {At the time that Kotronias wrote his book, this line had fallen out of favour, with players like Short preferring 4. Nf3 and 5. Be2.  However, Kotronias found new life in the old line.  I've found his strategy to be very attractive as White, using it exclusively against the Caro-Kann.  My losses have usually resulted from over-stretching myself and playing too loosely but I've had some satisfying wins.} e6 5. g4 {The start of White's exploitation of the exposed position of Black's Bishop.  White gains tempi to establish a formidable territory on the kingside.} Bg6 6. Nge2 Bb4 {?! Better are 6...c5 and 6...f6, both of which we looked at in the post-mortem and agreed that they gave Black much better chances.} 7. Ng3 {?!  This is mainly the result of me mis-remembering the line (which is just the first game in Kotronias's book).  Looking quickly through the book, I can only find a few examples of Ng3 being played early by White and none of them are in similar positions to this.  The objective is to prevent Black from playing ...Be4, disturbing White's KR.  However, it does invite Black to disturb White's pawn structure.  Better was an immediate 7. h4, when, if Black plays 7...Be4, White can play 8. Rh3 followed by Ng3 to chase off the bishop.} Bxc3+ {?! Another dubious move.  As Eddie said, Black should play this line like a Nimzo-Indian, only swapping the B for N when pushed to.  This exchange does weaken White's queenside pawns but Black fails to follow it up to exploit the weakness.  Better was 7...c5.} 8. bxc3 Ne7 9. h4 h6 10. h5 Bh7 11. Bd3 {I usually refrain from swapping off these bishops until I have to (or it's too late!)  However, on this occasion, I felt that it was a good gain of tempi to swap off a B that has made one move for one in which Black has invested 3 already.  The swap would also develop my Q to a good square.} Bxd3 12. Qxd3 Nd7 {Black resumes his development but the pawn structure prevents him from developing his knights actively.  For this reason, more active moves on the queenside were preferable, such as ...c5 or ...Qb6 or ...Qa5} 13. O-O {White castles behind his far-flung pawns in order to accelerate the attack by supporting the f-pawn to advance.  With his queenside in disarray, castling long was no more attractive than this and leaving the K in the centre would encourage Black to exploit the weakness on c3 sooner rather than later.  The risk of this strategy is that, in attacking with his kingside pawns, White over-stretches and his King is exposed to lethal fire from Queen and Rooks on the open files thus created.  Alternatively, Black gets Queen and Knights behind enemy lines and wreaks havoc.} Nb6 {This move momentarily gave me concern that the N was about to come to c4 but I soon decided that that was nothing much to worry about, so I continued on my merry way.} 14. f4 {! The position I had been aiming for, threatening to advance the f-pawn again and open lines to Black's uncastled king.  If Black castles kingside, it looks like he is walking into a pawn storm (which look more frightening than it really is if you analyse it).  Black sank into a long think ...} Qd7 {After this move, Black had just 39 minutes left on his clock.  I had 79.  He had examined all sorts of possibilities and finally concluded that he needed to castle queenside, which, actually, didn't help him a lot.  14...c5 was still the best move, we thought after the game.} 15. f5 {!? White presses on with his strategy.  Also possible were 15. Ba3 and 15. Be3, inhibiting ...c5 but inviting Black to play ...Nc4, when the bishop either has to move again or be swapped off.} c5 {At last Black plays this freeing move but it's too little too late.} 16. fxe6 fxe6 17. g5 {White aims either to swap pawns here and thus develop the bishop to a good square or further advance to pawn to secure an outpost on f7 for his rook.  I now had 57 minutes to my opponent's 34.} O-O-O {? Black relinquishes control of f7 and never recovers.  Better was ...cxd4 or ...Nc6.} 18. Rf7 {!  White pins the N against the Q and, by threatening to capture on g7, ties Black up in knots trying to defend it.} Rdg8 {?! Look at Black's pitiful rooks, stuck in the corner.  I thought ...Rhg8 was better, aesthetically at least, though White could have responded with 19. Qh7.  Perhaps 18...c4 to push the Q off that diagonal before moving the rook to defend g7 would have been better, also fixing White's weaknesses on c3 and c2 to enable a swift counter-attack with an appropriately timed ...Qa4} 19. Ba3 {It was finally time to do something with this bishop, which was preventing my rooks from coordinating with each other.  Black wasn't about to oblige me by swapping on g5, so I decided to go the other way, attacking c5 and skewering it to the N on e7.  Now 19...c4 20 Rxe7 cxd3 21. Rxd7 Kxd7 might have been interesting, though 20. Qf3 would have been sounder.} Qe8 {Black releases the pin and tries to shoo the annoying rook away.} 20. g6 {! White improves his stranglehold.  It's not clear, though, how White is going to convert pressure into victory.  That N on g3 is immobilised by the pawn structure.  In the post-mortem, in a similar position, we looked at improving its position with Nh1-f2-g4.  However, I have recent experience of similar complacent knight manoeuvres and getting punished for them.} Nd7 {This knight retreat defends c5 but it suggests another line of attack for White.} 21. Rb1 {!  No need to double rooks on the f-file.  Take aim directly at the King!  It was about time that I occupied this half-open file, which had been unattended since move 8.} Nc6 {...c4 was urgently required to prevent White's next.  The attack on White's Q would have given Black time then to move the knight safely.} 22. Qb5 {Now White has a serious direct attack going on Black's king.} Nd8 {I hadn't "seen" this but, in fact, it isn't much use.  While it appears to simultaneously defend b7 and attack the Rf7 it can't actually do both.  White can ignore the attack on the rook because of the mating attack on b7} 23. Bxc5 Nxc5 24. Qxc5+ Kb8 {?  The final error.  24...Nc6 would have lasted longer.} 25. Qc7+ Ka8 26. Qc8# {Very satisfying :-)}
