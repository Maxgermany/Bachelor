[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03), exchange, Karpov variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 {It's worth noting here that this is all of this opening that I know. Alekhine's, if memory serves. The book no doubt would get me to a better position than the fumbling I do as white now for several moves.} d6 4. c4 Nb6 5. exd6 cxd6 {At this point, it's possible I made book moves without knowing it since my opponent moved quickly. I don't like my King position just now...} 6. d5 Nb8d7 7. Nc3 Ne5 {It's worth noting that on the next black move, the c pawn cannot yet be taken(Qa4 checks and attacks c4 if black tries to grab the pawn), but I was playing quickly, and decided to protect it with the pawn and fianchetto my bishop. I'm sure there were more accurate moves than what I made.  And goflb, about the N defending A4, it goes without saying that ...Nxc4 Bxc4 Nxc4 leaves the a4 square undefended for Qa4, which results in black losing the minor piece, this is why c4 cannot be taken.} 8. b3 g6 {Black wastes no time in fianchettoing the dark-squared bishop. } 9. Bb2 {This move was made to prevent Nf3+ with the black bishop on g7. At this point, I don't like white's position. Perhaps there isn't anything obviously wrong, but instinctively I don't like it, especially with my King exposed.} Bg7 10. Nf3 Nxf3+ {So much for preventing that. I guess black decided he wanted the pressure sooner rather than later. Not sure that was necessary. Perhaps black was afraid of losing a tempo somewhere if I were to take instead. One thing I like about the white position is the other black knight is not doing so much right now.} 11. Qxf3 O-O 12. Be2 {Odd as this position looked to me, I felt a lot better about things. My King is about to safely hide before too much happens. Too bad the next few moves I failed to play very accurately!} Bf5 13. O-O a5 {I am about to make my first rather bad move. In retrospect, I think I should have moved Bd3 because a5 puts a lot of pressure indirectly on my rook.} 14. h4 {But instead, I thought to immediately hit at Black's King. 'Why not' I thought. I didn't care about my queenside so much if I could expose black's King.} h5 {Black is looking mighty good in this position. Great queen side pressure, and a safe King... while I am more cramped than it appears, and suddenly doing nothing at all. After thinking about it, I decide to offer up my rook...} 15. Rab1 {My thought was that I really wanted to get rid of that white bishop, and then sacrifice the white bishop against the kingside pawns, and then bring the knight up; a tempo would be needed by black before black could move the bishop, and I hoped to get pressure on the black king for the exchange. However, black decided he didn't want that rook yet, although I think he could have grabbed it and had enough time to defend. Someday I'll learn to use computer programs to analyze these positions and learn from them, rather than simply playing them and not studying them. So, before thinking of grabbing the rook, black made a quality move that totally gave me pause:} Qd7 {This move changed my mind about the rook sacrifice because now black will be able to control e6 too, and if the center opens up, were I down an exchange, the mobility on the board would wipe out any potential positional benefit... and black's king could also be protected better without black being cramped. So, without calculating... well, heck; I did not calculate ANY  moves this game until the end, and even then needed help for it to work; so, I played simply for opportunities to control squares and create weaknesses. But this opponent was no slouch, and inevitably began about now to do that to me!} 16. Rbd1 {Anyone who looks at this annotation... where would you have played the rook on b1? e1 may have been better, or perhaps even a1; but I did not want my rook on the f file to be completely hemmed in, and I was at this point still making plans on the Kingside...} a4 17. Qg3 {I decided I'd do the exchange sacrifice anyways, and see what came of it.} axb3 18. axb3 Bc2 19. Bxh5 Bxd1 20. Nxd1 {Black kept trading a bit more; why not, since he's up the exchange...} Bxb2 21. Nxb2 Qf5 {Looks very bad for white now. Of course I should avoid trading pieces. One thing of note, however, is the loss of the exchange is not hurting yet. The black bishop was a great defender and attacker, and now it's gone, while the black rooks are not yet busy. What to do now...} 22. Bg4 Qf6 {At this point, I pondered moving the Knight to d3, but worried that any thing I did against the black kingside would be way too slow. So I pushed the pawn.} 23. h5 Qxb2 {Bye bye, Knight. Black is winning overwhelmingly in material at this point, and he's rated nearly 2000. Black's King is under some pressure, however. The compensation is not enough for white, but at least the game's not boring! Play continued, and black really doesn't have time to snatch all the white pawns now which he could have had I moved my knight. For now, black's counterplay is not yet fully begun... hah. As if he needs it... or does he?} 24. hxg6 fxg6 25. Be6+ {Well this I did without thinking. I don't know if there was anything better, to be honest. White just doesn't have an attack that can break through easily with black controlling the a1-h8 diagonal. The white rook needs to be part of this, and it will take too long... shouldn't it?? To reply to the comment, you're right it's not enough, because now the pressure on black's king has weakened to the point that it appears white's attack fizzles and black simply can begin munching pawns or working up his own attack. Accurate play by black is simply a won game. That's the problem with Blitz play, isn't it. ;)} Kg7 26. Qg5 Qf6 {Trading now would be as good as resigning for white.} 27. Qe3 Ra6 {This is not bad. Yes, the rook is at the moment only defending, but the Knight will go to a8 and then to c7. And in this position, that knight will be very strong, because if black succeeds in trading his knight, white's attacking chances will evaporate, AND that black rook will then move to an immediately useful square. But, there is a more interesting move: Ra1! If ...QxN, then Rxf1+ Kxf1;  Qa1+  Ke2; Qb2+ and although I did not bother to think about what comes next, it looks very bad for white. Just as bad for white is ...Rxa1 Qxa1+ Kh2 Rh8+ Kg3 and Qe5 forces a queen trade, after which black wins with a rook and knight vs the bishop. Fortunately for me, black missed Ra1+, intent on getting his Knight into the game. If Ra1, white's position is hopeless. But now white can play on a little longer...} 28. g3 {Necessary for any hope of activating the rook, and black still doesn't see Ra1. I really should have resigned long ago, but I wanted to see what would happen.} Na8 {Here comes the knight. Now, in chess, it's important to have a plan. In a blitz game, we can't always see everything on the board; and so, black continued with his plan, a good plan. He had many to choose from. At this point, I had finally begun to calculate, and had foreseen what I hoped would happen, and what actually did happen.} 29. Kg2 Nc7 30. Rh1 {This is another fun position, easily avoidable by black but his plan was to activate the knight, by golly. Here is where black panicked a little, and instead of calmly taking the bishop with the knight, he moves Rh8!? Instead, after Nxe6 Qe6+ Kf7 dxe6+ Ke8, white has to return to the defensive, and again black easily wins.} Rh8 {So I of course knew that the white rook was untouchable, and after I took the black rook, he quickly realized this and quit in disgust at himself. (Rxh8+ Kxh8 Qh6#) Play might have continued...} 31. Rxh8 {At this point he had left the game. But playing a bit futher we find...} Nxe6 {Pg5 might actually turn out better for black.  We could have ...Pg5 Rg8+ Kh6 and it looks like black can play on only a pawn down. Qc1 threatening Qh1 of course fails to ...Ra1 still a useful rook move for black. Now if black takes the Bishop, things get interesting...} 32. Qh6+ Kf7 33. dxe6+ {Here black must take with the King; (Qxe6 Qf8#)} Kxe6 34. Rf8 {Rf8! And with this move, g6 will fall next, and depending on where black moves, mate follows or black loses too many of his pawns, and white wins.} Qc3 {Qd4 is better, because it puts pressure on f2 and protects the d pawn later on. Not sure if Qb2 was an option to keep pressure on f2 and attack b3. Still think Qd4 looked better. But I put it here where the queen is not doing anything useful for black, and did not feel like redoing this annotation to show the better position. It's late, and I'm tired. EDIT: And now if I fix the annotation, comments at the end would be lost. Qd4 or Qb2 is much better for black, and the endgame uncertain. But I'll leave this as it is now, so no comments are lost. } 35. Qxg6+ {...Ke5 leads to mate, so...} Kd7 36. Qe8+ {Now Ke6 leads to mate via Qc8+ Ke5 Qf5+ etc.} Kc7 {And at the least, two more black pawns fall, and with some care, white has a won game. But this was more fun than looking at Pg5, wouldn't you say? ;)  A very fun blitz game. EDIT: Early I spoke about Qd4 for black as being better, and perhaps it is. But it looks like black's chances for winning remain slim although a perpetual might be very possible. Anyone gets to this point, still would like a comment as to where white's rook should go on move 16.}
