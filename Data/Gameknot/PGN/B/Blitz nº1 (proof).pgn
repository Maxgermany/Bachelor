[Opening "Dutch (A80)"]

1. d4 f5 {We had played some games previously, and our opening scheme was already set. He liked the dutch, I love the London attack. So we went for it.} 2. c3 {"Too passive!" "Self blocking move!".  Yes, but my plan is to attack strongly on the kingside, so I need to have the queenside completely locked.  Of course, all this holds in a blitz game where I more or less know my opponent's way of playing. } g6 {...assuming the blockade of the black diagonal.} 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Bf4 {The caracteristic move for white ("my way"). Bg5 is a waste of time, since Nf6 unpins the e pawn for black.  Moreover, now black can have either a N or a B in g5 at any moment. He can kick them out very easily (h6), but weakening the kingside, and you know, a moment can be enough.  } Nf6 5. h4 {I don't care about a possible Ng4. I know that the Dutch "must" be attacked soon and strongly. And that if black has some weak point, it is the h column.  The a2-g8 diag can be easily covered with e6...} b6 {Black takes it easily. The h4 move didn't tell him what I am thinking...} 6. Qb3 {I'm not doing really anything, but I must make him defend.} e6 7. e3 Bb7 8. Be2 Nc6 9. Nbd2 {All are normal and quiet developement moves. But black, in my view, must get to o-o-o, or to attack the queenside (far from it), but he seemed to think that he is all-right, so he castled kingside. } O-O 10. h5 {I didn't even think about it. The other rook is coming soon. If I o-o-o first, he can suspect something... and take some countermeasure.  You know, this is blitz...} Nxh5 11. Rxh5 {without thinking it twice.} gxh5 12. O-O-O {Enough? I don't know, really, I like to play in an "attack or die" fashion, when no serious prize is on the table. } a5 {At last black weakens up! But...} 13. a4 Ne7 {Just to allow BxNf3 and loosen a little the pressure. But it doesn't help. } 14. Rh1 Qe8 {This move just loeses a tempo in a position where correct defence is badly needed. } 15. Ng5 {Ok, so after Ng6, it was unclear how I could have won, but it would have been another game.  Of course, after Bxg2, Bxh5 then Rg1. } Nd5 {Blocking the queen's action and threatening the dsb. } 16. Bxh5 {Of course} Qe7 {Of course. Now, the move that makes the game interesting. Nothing special, but still...} 17. Nxh7 {Black doesn't have to take the knight.  NxBf4 is nice, and probably white loses.  But, if he do takes it...} Kxh7 18. Bf7+ {Yum yum! } Bh6 19. Bxh6 {...and this is the second one.  If Rxh6+, Kg7 and "nothing happens"... except white loses a piece. But this way, if black takes f7 with the queen, Bxf8+, and probably wins due to Qd1, coming into the action.   The game followed some more moves, but finally white won. }
