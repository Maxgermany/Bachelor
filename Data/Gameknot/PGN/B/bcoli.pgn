[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 {I don't often play black against a queen pawn opening, and I thought I would try a new response.  The first six moves were selected from the GameKnot database and choosing what I thought looked interesting.  Computer analysis at:  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=19356720&fb=1&rnd=0.35731651983223855} 2. Nc3 d5 3. h3 c5 4. dxc5 e5 5. b4 a5 6. Ba3 Na6 7. Qb1 axb4 {I initiate the exchange because I think it will end in my favor.} 8. Bxb4 Nxb4 9. Qxb4 b6 {This move was actually my first "mistake" according to the computer analysis, which favored "d4" instead.  At my level, I disagree that this was a mistake, and I actually think that this was one of my pivotal moves.  The computer analysis shows that the best response to b6 is qb5+.  However, that doesn't give white any obvious gain (Bd7 response), so few players at my level would choose that.  I like my move and would use it again because of the powerful threats against white's queen and knight (which I eventually took).  I thought that white would likely retreat, and I would move pxc5.  Instead, white fell for the bait.  That put me at -2, but I quickly responded by taking white's knight and pawn and pinning white's king and a1 rook for the entire rest of the game.} 10. Qxb6 Qxb6 11. cxb6 Bb4 {I had my eye on this trap.} 12. Rb1 Bxc3+ 13. Kd1 Rxa2 14. Kc1 Ba6 {In my opinion, this was my worst move of the game.  The computer analysis labels it as a mistake in favor of "Ne4".  White could have advanced to b7 to win my bishop, but neither mrshtaba nor the computer analysis picked up on this.   Anyway, in the end, this move was essentially just a wasted move.  I think that I should have castled or moved the bishop to b7 instead.  I wanted to focus on the right side, and I don't think that Ne4 would have progressed to mate as quickly.} 15. Nf3 {I'm not sure why the computer analysis didn't label his Nf3 move as a mistake.  I think that b7 is much stronger.} O-O 16. e3 Bb7 {I should have moved the bishop here originally since I could not have maintained control of that diagonal and trading bishops would have not been advantageous.} 17. Nd2 Rfa8 {It should have been obvious for the past several moves that I am aiming for a rook attack on the right side.  White's protection with his knight only delays the attack.} 18. Nb3 Nd7 19. f3 Nxb6 {I am not worried at all about what is going on on the left side of the board.  My knight is playing the crucial role of eliminating the threat of the advanced pawn in addition to dislodging either white's knight or b1 rook.} 20. Bd3 Nc4 {If white takes my knight, my pawn will then threaten his carefully placed knight.  That is why he leaves it alone while I go and attack his rook.} 21. e4 {White should have taken my knight because moving his knight to d2 would have been much better than losing his rook.  This is essentially an unrecoverable blunder by white.} Na3 22. Nd2 {The computer labels this a blunder by white and suggests that he should have moved Ra1; but I honestly think he doesn't have any good option at this point, since Ra1 would give me an 8 point lead and an attacking position.} Nxb1 23. Nxb1 Ra2a1 24. Rd1 {White just blocked off his only escape route giving me mate in 2.  However, the alternative (Kd1) would have given me a 13 point lead.  With those alternatives, the best thing is probably just to hope your opponent makes a mistake.} Rxb1+ {}
