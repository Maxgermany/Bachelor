[Opening "Latvian counter-gambit (C40)"]

1. e4 {Hi all! This is yet another game in the Latvian Gambit, where I fall far behind in material as Black due to some very clever tactics on White's part, and then scrap and stamp my way through the rest of the game. This game is, as the title suggests, a lesson in relentless, aggressive activity. I recommend reading in the interactive viewer, since there are a few long comments and the one-page scrolling layout doesn't show line breaks for whatever reason. Enjoy!} e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The Latvian Gambit. I will not go over the opening lines in detail here; I annotated a series consisting of my first ten games with the opening here on GK, so take a look at those for detailed explanation and examples of the opening lines.} 3. d3 {White declines (I don't think this is sound; better is accepting with 3.Nxe5, 3.exf5, or delaying/offering a countergambit with 3.d4 or 3.Bc4). Again, see my Latvian Gambit series for more detail.} d6 {? I've come to think that this is too passive. I prefer 3...Nc6 or 3...Nf6 here, allowing ...d7-d5 in one move later on and not trapping the DSB.} 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bd2 Nf6 6. Ng5 {! This is an interesting thought. White prepares for a kingside attack with Be2 and Bh5+, while denying Black's QB a spot on e6 and refraining from capturing on f5 (which would also free Black's LSB). } Nc6 {A somewhat passive waiting move. I think 6...O-O was probably safe here, but Black wants to castle queenside if possible.} 7. Be2 Nxe4 {?! The number of variations suddenly skyrockets with this sacrifice. Black wants to make use of his superior kingside space and preempt any White aggression, so he breaks out this unlikely move. Let's take a look at some of the more likely variations:  First of all, take stock of what the move did. Black captured a pawn and threatens both of White's Knights, his DSB, and his f2 pawn. Moreover, he threatens to win the Ng5 outright. White has three ways to retake the Knight, or he can play Bh5+.   (A) White can play 8.dxe4, to which Black will respond 8...Bxg5, with a net gain of a pawn for Black. No dice.  (B) White can play 8.Ncxe4 and defend his g5 Knight, to which the likely continuation is 8...fxe4 9.Nxe4 O-O, maintaining material equality and opening a lot of space on the kingside for both players. Alternately, Black may opt for 8...h6?!, in which case White has two options: 9.Nf3 fxe4 10.dxe4 O-O, with a similar situation  as above but with the Knight blocking in the Be2, or 9.Nxd6+?! followed by 10.Nf3, with an unclear position.  (C) White can play 8.Ngxe4, which maintains equality after 8...fxe4 9.Nxe4 (or 9.dxe4) ...O-O. This is similar to option B, except it guarantees that Black can occupy the center with a Knight if he wants to (at least until Black decides to play ...d5).  (D) White may also choose to postpone the issue of the Ne4 with an intermediate check via 8.Bh5+ g6, at which point White must choose which of his various pieces to sacrifice and how, noting that options A, B, and C remain on the table here, but with the added complications posed by the Bishop.} 8. Bh5+ g6 {Naturally, White chose option D, the most complex line by far. There is now a standing threat on every White minor piece, but as Mikhail Tal once said, "They can only take them one at a time!" Black has decent kingside space but also significant kingside weaknesses, and White's pieces are posed to attack. The only question is: where?} 9. Nxh7 {! I like this the best out of the possible variations. White is now threatening 10.Bxg6+ Kd7 11.Bxf5+ Ke8 12.Qh5# if Black doesn't do something about it right away, so something like 9...Nxc3 is off the table. Black has to eliminate one of the White minor pieces, and as 9...gxh5 seems to lead logically into 10.Qxh5+ Kd7 11.Qxf5+ Ke8 12.Qxe4 and a loss for Black, it seems Black must accept the lager material sacrifice in exchange for more activity.} Rxh7 10. Bxg6+ Kf8 {Critically, not blocking in the LSB.} 11. Bxh7 Nf6 {Seeking to trap the White Bishop, which is not quite possible, but at least this avoids more exchanges for now. Black needs as many active pieces as he can get. This also forestalls any threats of 12.Bh6+ Kf7 13.Qh5+, which would be a deadly combination without a Knight to defend against it.} 12. Bg6 Nd4 {White is preparing to retreat to h5, so Black sets up a combination to win back a pawn and isolate the d-pawn as a future target with 13.Bh5 Nxc2+ 14.Qxc2 Nxh5.} 13. Ne2 {Squelching Black's intentions. Now 13...Nxc2+ 14.Qxc2 Kg6 15.Bxf5 Bxf5 leaves Black developed, but badly behind and facing a huge pawn force on the kingside.} Kg7 14. Nxd4 Kxg6 {The Bishop is far too dangerous to live, especially when the alternative is taking a Knight with a pawn that would become entirely indefensible. Black's strong center pawn chain is the only possible shelter for his King right now.} 15. Nb3 {?! White apparently wants to head to the queenside, or at least avoid locking himself up on the kingside, but I think 15.Ne2 (with an eye to playing 16.f4 or 16.d4) was stronger here. On b3, this Knight has very few prospects.} f4 {Loosing the LSB and giving White's DSB some granite to chew on.} 16. h3 Bf5 {Perhaps 16...Be6 or 16...Bd7 was better; Black is not looking for a center pawn break here. Besides trying to contain White's kingside mass, he should be looking for queenside counterplay, especially taking advantage of that misplaced Nb3, so 16...a5 is a good possibility as well.} 17. Qe2 {White prepares to castle, connect his Rooks, and take the kingside by force.} a5 {Again, I think this could have been played last turn, but now that White is unequivocally positioned to castle long, there's no sense delaying any further.} 18. g4 {?! This should have been supported first, by castling and getting a Rook to g1. The reversal of the move order costs White an important tempo, allowing Black to delay White's castling further, thus keeping the QR out of play.} fxg3 e.p. 19. fxg3 a4 20. Nc1 {20.Na5 b6 21.Nc4 (or 21.Nc6 Qd7) ...b5 22.Na5 c5 looks a little dangerous (though I think it's probably better), so White chooses the safe route with this secure, but awkward, retreat.} Qh8 {The BQ swings over to threaten h3 and generally help to defend the kingside in preparation for the queenside assault, which will be conducted at long range by Black's Queen and Bishops behind a slow-moving wall of pawns.} 21. Qg2 c6 22. Ne2 Be6 23. Nc3 {Threatening Ne5 in an attempt to trade off the Black defenders and hurry to the endgame.} d5 {Black's LSB is terrible, but it can't be helped at the moment. It's also playing a critical role tying the White pieces to the defense of h3 (though as we'll see shortly, it's pretty much just a bluff--if Black takes on h3 while the Rook is still there, chances are he'd lose the Bishop before he could unpin it from his Queen).} 24. a3 b5 {!? Risky, but I think probably necessary. Black *must* achieve queenside counterplay, and he has no time to lose.} 25. Qe2 Bd6 {For Black, every move is a cat-and-mouse game of keeping everything protected for just long enough to set up a combination counterstrike. The squares most important at the moment are e4, g4, and h5, though he has to be aware of the possibility of Qe3 followed by Qg5+. For White, it's a question of making sure he'll actually be safe when he finally castles and brings his Queen's Rook into the game with deadly force.} 26. O-O-O {White has decided it's safe enough and stops beating about the bush. Note that Black's "threat" on h3 is revealed to be a sham: 26...Bxh3? 27.Qh2! and nothing can save Black's position. Black's actual options, then, are few: but the best one seems obvious.} b4 {The castle needs to be broken and the Knight needs to leave. Obviously leading with ...d4 would be disastrous, as the Knight could comfortably relocate to e4 with unignorable threats to the Black King.} 27. axb4 a3 {! Recapturing with the Bishop doesn't accomplish what Black needs to accomplish, and actually should lose in short order: 27...Bxb4? 28.Qxe5 Kf7 29.Rdf1! Remember, Black's playing a game of keeping everything together *just long enough*. The pawn on e5 is still important, and the goal is to break into White's castle, which 27...a3 does splendidly.} 28. bxa3 Rxa3 29. Nb1 {This poor Knight has moved eight times, only to end up back on its home square. From here, Black has only a few options (29...Ra1 pinning the Knight, 29...Ra2 looking to prevent the WK from gaining an escape square/defensive pawn shield through c2-c4), but after looking them over, only one seems to be aggressive enough to force White to do something about it:} Qa8 {!? Let's not forget how this game started: Black exchanged material for aggression and tempo. No sense in changing the plan now! The Rook has done an admirable job tearing into the White castle, but some risks are in order if Black is to hold on to the initiative and get the Queen back to the action while continuing to create threats.} 30. Nxa3 {? I think this is a fatal--well, not entirely fatal--mistake. White has an overwhelming material advantage already: all he needs to do is stop Black from rampaging for a turn or two, and then blast onto the Kingside in full force. Taking this Knight guarantees Black at least a draw (see below), whereas all White must do to stall the Black assault is abandon his queenside castle and hide on d2. There are many sufficient possibilities, but 30.c4 Ra1 31.Bc3 Qa3+ 32.Qb2 looks perfectly safe, for example.  The text gives Black exactly what he wants: the White King, all alone, facing the Black Queen in a box when Black has the initiative. After 30...Qxa3+ 31.Kb1 d4, White has only one option to prevent mate on a2: 32.c4.  If Black is greedy and goes for a win with 32...dxc3 e.p. if White plays very accurately he might be able to escape with 33.Bxc3 Qxc3 32.Qb2 (I'm not going to analyze all the variations particularly deeply, but 33.Bc1 does fail to a perpetual check after 33...Qxb4+ 34.Ka1 Qa4+ etc, for instance).  However, if Black is content with a draw (and he should be, given the situation), he can force one very easily by jumping the Queen around between b3, a3, and a2, keeping the WK in check with no chance to interpose or escape.} Qxa3+ 31. Kb1 d4 32. Bc1 {?? White overlooks the main threat.} Qa2# {That's it! There were certainly mistakes made on both sides, but hopefully you found this game as fun to read as I found it fun to play. It's certainly not often you see a King arrive on g6 on the fourteenth move and then remain unmolested for the rest of the game! This was a great demonstration, I think, of the importance and power of energetic play, especially when significantly behind in material.  Thanks very much to aramberber for the games! This was a league match; the other game is worth a look as well, in my opinion: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/braveheart?gm=45570 Comments on the analysis or on the game itself are much appreciated; if you leave a rating, please also let me know what I need to improve or what I did well. Thanks for reading!}
