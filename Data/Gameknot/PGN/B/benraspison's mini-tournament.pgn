1. e4 {MINI tournament... i thought in the beginning that i would lose the match....} e5 {same move as me} 2. Qh5 {i did this because everyone that has no brains does this: g7-g6 so i attack e5 (check and i can get his rook)} Nc6 {but.... he did that...} 3. Bc4 {with this i wanted to do h5-f7} g6 {but no he did that... -_-} 4. Qf3 {same thing} Nf6 {defended it...} 5. d3 {i did that because i can get my bishop out of there and attack the knight} d6 6.
