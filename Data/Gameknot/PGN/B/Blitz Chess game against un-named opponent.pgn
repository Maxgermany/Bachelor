1. Nf3 e6 2. d4 d6 {This is very passive in my opinion.} 3. c4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. e4 Bd7 6. Bd3 O-O {He has given me total control of the center. There are sound defenses were black intentionally does this, but this is not one of them.} 7. O-O Qc8 8. Qc2 Nc6 9. a3 {To prevent Nb4 forking my queen and bishop.} e5 10. d5 Nd8 11. b4 Bg4 12. Ne1 Nh5 13. f3 Bd7 14. f4 Nxf4 15. Bxf4 exf4 16. Rxf4 Bg5 17. Rf1 Bh3 {He gives me his bishop w/ no compensation (except the pawn). My queen and kingside rook can come in to defend his one piece queen attack.} 18. gxh3 Qxh3 19. Rf3 Qg4+ 20. Rg3 Qf4 21. Ng2 Qd2 {trading is not good for him as he is down material.} 22. Qxd2 Bxd2 23. Bc2 Bxc3 24. Rxc3 f6 25. Rf1 Nf7 26. Nf4 g6 27. Ne6 Rfc8 28. Rxf6 Ne5 29. Bb3 Ng4 30. Rf4 Ne5 31. Rc2 Nd3 32. Rf6 Ne5 33. h3 Nf7 34. Rcf2 Ne5 35. c5 Nd3 36. Rf2f3 Ne5 37. Rg3 {Since he could not play Rf8 to contend my rooks on the file, and he has the f7 & f8 squares covered, I saw no need for both rooks there. Better to get on the g file and harass his g-pawn since the king can't move forward.} Nf7 38. h4 Ne5 39. h5 Kh8 40. hxg6 Nxg6 41. Rf7 Rcg8 {Here is where I missed it. Being blitz, I failed to see the piees in line on the g-file with my king!} 42. Rh3 {???} Nf4+ {!} 43. Kh2 Nxh3 44. Kxh3 Rg6 45. Nf4 Rh6+ 46. Kg4 Rg8+ 47. Kf5 Rc8 48. Ne6 Rh5+ 49. Kg4 Rh6 50. Rxc7 Rg8+ 51. Kf4 Rh4+ 52. Ke3 Rh3+ 53. Kd4 Rxb3 {I did not care about losing the bishop as I gain a passed, advanced pawn, which can't be stopped without a sacrifice.} 54. cxd6 Rxa3 55. d7 Ra4 56. Kc5 b6+ 57. Kc6 Rxb4 58. d8=Q Rxd8 59. Nxd8 {Now there is no way I can lose!} Rxe4 60. Rxa7 h5 61. d6 h4 62. d7 h3 63. Nf7+ Kg8 {? If he insists on playing this out, he should have played Kg7, to prevent the queen check.} 64. d8=Q+ {He resigned.}
