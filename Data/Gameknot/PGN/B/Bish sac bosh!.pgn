1. Nf3 {Not the standard opening move, but it is 1 I quite often play myself so it's well within my comfort zone..} d6 {I decide to plump for the KID, i have to admit from the start, it's a defence I rarely use and you will see why shortly..} 2. d4 g6 3. c4 {Striving to get a grip on the center, and to be honest i should have put up more of a fight for it, but....} Bg7 4. e3 Nf6 {Now only a move away from castling and then it's time to challenge for the center...} 5. Nc3 c6 {I really don't know why i played this little move, i guess i was a little concerned about 6.d5, probably unduly, but it does serve the purpose of also creating an easy exit for my Q should the need or desire arise..} 6. Be2 {Preparing to castle...} O-O 7. O-O b6 {Again another move i don't think was all that productive, maybe Ng4 would have been better..} 8. Rb1 Nbd7 {I decide to try and activate my remaining pieces. So far it's been a fairly tame game..} 9. b4 Qc7 {This move serves a couple of purposes, 1 it supports the b,c and d pawns and also keeps it's gaze on h2..} 10. Bb2 Bb7 {Now my development is complete, at this point of the game no-one has fired the first arrow or even yelled an insult across no-mans land, this is about to change!} 11. Nd2 {I'm not sure about this move, it leaves h2 very insecure and my queens x-ray vision is firmly fixed..Although a timely g3 will deal with that.} e5 {I decide to make the first move, of course i don't expect white to take the pawn, unless i've missed something...} 12. Nb3 d5 {Tring to open up the b8 h2 diagonal and create real threats..} 13. Rc1 {Lining up against my Q..} c5 {So i push again, somethings gotta snap soon...} 14. bxc5 {Here we go...} dxc4 {Chaos ensues...} 15. Bxc4 exd4 16. exd4 {Now that the dust settles a little, i find myself a pawn down, but i have some great diagonals to work from and the white king is looking a little lonely atm..} Nh5 {So i advance towards the target..} 17. Nb5 {This move worried me a little and i took a little time to look over my options, and my opponents} Qf4 {I decide this is the best spot for her, hopefully keeping the pressure on and not exposing her to a deadly chase..} 18. Nd6 {yeah, the counter attack is coming and left unchecked could become fatal, i ponder what to do with this piece, what would you have done?} Bxg2 {I was pretty sure this was a sound sac, it opens the king up and the lack of defensive support really helped to make up my mind for me, even if it comes to nothing i know it will cause disruption and white will have to play accurately to weather the storm..} 19. Kxg2 {Accepting my offer, probably had to..} Ndf6 {So i start to close the rest of my minor pieces in on the mark..} 20. Be2 {white has to try to exchange some pieces off quick, and i have to avoid it for as long as possible..} Qg5+ {freeing up a spot for my knight..} 21. Kh1 Nf4 {threatening Qg2#} 22. Bf3 {Closing that door, but as one door shuts another opens...} Nf6h5 {Bringing in reinforcements....White is tied up defending and i feel pretty secure so i continue to concentrate on an all out attack....} 23. Rg1 {I knew this was coming, it's what i would have done instead of Bf3 on move 22..} Qh4 {Now f2 becomes a target..} 24. Rc2 {A good move, as far as white squares are concerned he/she has all the power, so the rook is safe there..for now.} Nh3 {So i up the ante a little..} 25. Rg2 {At this point i got a little stuck, it felt like my momentum was waning and if i wasn't careful or creative the tide was gonna turn..} Nh5f4 {just to keep on the pressure, in hindsight i should have brought my a rook onto the e file, but if I'm honest my attention wasn't on the rook so i left it where it was..} 26. Rg3 {Was hoping for Rg3, but i guess he/she wasn't gonna let that happen..} Ng5 {Keeping the threats going whilst i try and come up with a decisive blow, this move did, however, backfire...} 27. Bxa8 {HUH? Where did..oh yeah, missed that..however i wasn't;t to concerned as the rook was playing no part in the attack and the bishop was more valuable as a defensive piece i think, i would have kept hold of it cos that bishop really was the bane of my attack, so i was more than OK to lose the exchang3e..} Rxa8 {right, now that one of his grip on the white squares is faltering i have a little more room for maneuver} 28. Qg1 Nfh3 {straight on her...} 29. Qg2 {Getting my remaining rook in the line of sight, i have to keep an eye on this..} Qh5 {An open invite to take it, and drag the queen away, i do wander what would have hapened had my opponent taken the rook with + However...} 30. c6 {hmmm, i can see that a passed pawn is dangerous, but why not Qxa8+ Bf8, then c6, i'm sure this was a real blunder on my part/ (and his/hers) and lucky to have survived this one...} Qd1+ {But this was my plan, now the white queen is lost and it's game over, i wanted to annotate this game to highlight that sacrificing is a beautiful thing when it works, and to show that chess is about taking each opportunity at the right time, had white played Qxa8 this game would have been a black loss, so no matter how confident you feel about a situation, something can always come up and bite your arse!}
