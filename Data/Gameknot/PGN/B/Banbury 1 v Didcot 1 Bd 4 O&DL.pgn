1. d4 {My first OTB game of the season, following a horrendous season last year, when I dropped from the 1st team to the 2nd team and still didn't do very well.  Nevertheless, hope springs eternal and the 1st team was short of players, so I filled in.  Things didn't start well for me as I turned up at their old venue and, as 7:30pm drew near, realised that there were no chess players present or boards being set up, so I asked at the bar and was directed to the new venue on the other side of town, arriving about 8 mins late.  Fortunately, the match had not yet started.} Nf6 2. Bg5 {The Trompowsky: not an opening I know very well.  I do have a 1998 book by Joe Gallagher on it but not only is it somewhat out of date but I haven't studied it very well, so this is a learnign experience for me.} Ne4 {This seems the most active response, avoiding immediate doubled pawns or pins but it requires accurate play. } 3. Bh4 {I got into trouble in a recent Gameknot game against 3. h4, so I was glad not to see that.  Gallagher comments that "3. Bh4 used to be the main line but has been discredited somewhat in recent years".  As the game went on, I found this bishop to be a major thorn in my side as it severely inhibited my development.} d5 {Gallagher describes this as "a solid move which, in my opinion, fails to exploit the position of the bishop on h4."  He prefers 3....c5 or 3....g5 or 3....c6, citing one of his own games as an example of 3....g5, which he drew against Illescas in 1985.  It leads to some bizarre-looking pawn formations.} 4. e3 {This is not mentioned by Gallagher, so it's either a modern innovation or not very good.  It seems to me to be a natural developing move that doesn't create any weaknesses in White's position or provoke any particular response from Black.} c6 {After quite a long think, I decided on this conservative approach, hoping to exploit the absence of White's DSB from the queenside.  I was already worrying about how to develop my kingside, given that the e-pawn was pinned against my Q and that both ...f6 and ...g5 looked ugly to me.  So I planned to get the Q away from the pin, then play ...e6, followed by developing my DSB and castling kingside.  Given the passivity of my resulting game, I think in retrospect that 4....g5 would have been the better option.} 5. Nd2 {White challenges Black's central N with his own N, rather than pushing at it with 5. f3.} Qa5 {In accordance with my plan, I deferred the decision whether to swap Ns or retreat but continuing with my plan for developing my kingside and taking the opportunity to pin White's N.  This move is much less effective than it would have been if we had omitted 3....d5 4. e3 when the Q could have swung across to h5.} 6. c3 {The natural response.} Nxd2 {Now I decided to follow Yelena Dembo's maxim that one should only retreat when absolutely necessary or advantageous, so, rather than retreat to d6, I swapped.} 7. Qxd2 {The natural recapture, which could possibly facilitate Q-side castling but that looks a bit dangerous with Black's Q ready to pounce.} Bf5 {At this point, I first considered continuing with my plan for kingside castling with 7....e6 but I didn't like the way that it would box my LSB in, especially with my remaining N being so limited in options.  Moreover, if I did develop with 7...e6 and 8...Be7, White could capture on e7, forcing my K to recapture and I wouldn't be able to castle anyway; so I delayed those moves by developing this B outside the intended pawn fortress, leaving for later the decision on how I would develop the kingside.} 8. Bd3 {I hadn't really considered deeply enough this obvious response.  No bishop retreats looked attractive and 8....Be4 just seemed to encourage White to play 9. f3, building a strong centre with tempo.  I didn't really consider 8...Bg4 for the same reason, so ....} Bxd3 {I decided to swap, despite bringing his Q onto a powerful square that threatens h7 and can be followed up quickly with Ng1-f3-g5.} 9. Qxd3 Nd7 {As discussed before, ...e6 still did not look attractive, so I developed the N to the more central of its 2 options, whence it could, hopefully, eventually nestle on f6 or support a pawn thrust to e5 or c5.} 10. f4 {So much for entertaining notions of 10....e5 ... A good aggressive move by White, surely to be followed by the N developing and castling kingside.} e6 {Finally, I decided that I had no choice but to play this, even though I wasn't very happy with it.} 11. Nf3 {As predicted.} Bd6 {As discussed previously, 11....Be7 was unattractive due to 12. Bxe7 but I was still determined to castle and, with d8 covered by White's DSB, queenside castling was out of the question.  So my DSB went to the only available square that wasn't covered by a White pawn or piece.} 12. O-O {As predicted.} h6 {Now I felt that this prophylactic move was necessary to delay White's attack if I did manage to castle.} 13. Ne5 {So White parked his N on e5, attcking f7 and asking me the question ...} Bxe5 {I didn't feel I could just leave it there, as I couldn't castle without leaving the Nd7 unprotected, and, if I didn't castle, he could swap on d7 and I'd have to recapture with the K anyway (maybe not a disaster, given the fortress of the phalanx of pawns on white squares, but White already had f5 prepared).  Capturing with the N, which seemed the more natural move, would have resulted in the Bd6 then having to move after White had recaptured on e5, so, in the interests of speed, I gave up B for N.} 14. fxe5 {The logical recapture, opening the f-file for rook action and keeping Black's pawns locked.} O-O {Finally, I'd achieved my first strategic objective, believing that I could defend the castled position effectively against the forthcoming invasion via the dark squares.} 15. Be7 {Thankfully, not a surprise but I had underestimated the concern that f7 was going to cause me.} Rfe8 16. Bd6 Qd8 {The Q had no further purpose on the queenside and was urgently required to marshal the defence of the kingside.} 17. Rf3 {White's plan is simple: use his heavy pieces on the f, g and h files till something in Black's defences gives then break through and force mate.  Carrying it out requires some resourcefulness, though.} f6 {Given the weakness of f7 in the face of the forthcoming rook battery and the impossibility of using f8 or e7 from which to defend it, I decided to move the pawn immediately, thereby creating a new weakness in my position ...} 18. Qg6 {Which White immediately occupied, with the obvious threat of a battery on the g-file, followed by mate on g7 or the capture of h6.} Nf8 {After the game, my opponent complimented me on this move, which, to me, seemed to be my only sensible option.} 19. Bxf8 {White gives up his wonderful B to take the N that threatened his Q.  While waiting for this move, I was busily considering whether White could actually afford to sac his Q rather than play this move: eg 19. exf6 Nxg6 20. f7+ Kg8 21. fxe8=Q+ Qxe8 22. Raf1 but I couldn't quite see how White could force home such an attack.} Rxf8 {Now I was at last starting to feel more comfortable: could I get away with a draw?} 20. Rg3 {As predicted.} Qe7 {There was no way to prevent both Qxg7mate and Qxh6, so I played the most flexible defensive move I could find, hoping that, eventually I'd be able to equalise by exploiting the f-file.} 21. Qxh6 fxe5 22. dxe5 Rf5 {I chose this square so as not to occupy f7, which might soon be needed as an escape square for my King.  It also threatened the spare pawn on e5, but this was not my main objective, which was still defence.} 23. Qg6 {Having won the pawn, Wgite returned his Q to g6, preparing to move his R to the h-file to support check on h7.} Raf8 {By doubling my rooks on the f-file, I hoped to prevent White's other rook from making a useful contribution.} 24. Rh3 {As predicted.} Rg5 {Dreamt up as the only move I could think of that didn't make my position worse.  It had the added bonus of applying some potential pressure on White's king's position.} 25. Qh7+ {As predicted.} Kf7 {Only legal move.} 26. Rf1+ {Now White has successfully brought this rook into the action ... I wondered if perhaps my R should have stayed on f5 after all ...} Ke8 {Heading for safety on the queenside.  I was still only a pawn down, with the potential to win that back on e5, so I felt I'd almost equalised.} 27. Rxf8+ {Of course!  Now White has a clear path to swapping off Queens and than exploiting Black's back rank with his remaining rook, winning the rook and pawn endgame easily.} Qxf8 {As I played this, I saw a glimmer of hope, if White avoided the obvious 28. Qh8, which was clearly winning, and chose to attack my Q with his rook.} 28. Rf3 {??  Just as he released his hand off the piece, White recognised his blunder and offered his hand as I advanced my Queen.  For some reason, the pin on the g-file was not that obvious.} Qxf3 {A lucky escape!  I think I nearly deserved it though, as I had defended a bad position resolutely until the opportunity offered itself and I was alert enough to have spotted it beforehand.}
