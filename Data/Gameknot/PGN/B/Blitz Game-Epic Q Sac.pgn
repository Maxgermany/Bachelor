[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02)"]

1. e4 {Joe has a preference for 1.d4 openings, but he said that he's always willing to try different openings.} Nf6 {Standard.} 2. Qf3 {Well, in order to make this sac, you have to bring the Q out early.  And, I say that because in these instances, Joe bring his Q out by the second move.  And, yes, he is deviating from the guidelines which helped me remember something, (after going wrong against andywm, followed by my most recent loss against archduke_piccolo).  It is that, sometimes, you have to deviate from the guidelines in extenuating circumstances.  In this case, he doesn't, but the idea also is that, sometimes, it pays off to boast about these unusual wins, where you generally don't things the way they're supposed to done and win.  That's why, although many people dislike it, I (absolutely) enjoy it, when tactical-abyss boasts (kibitzes) about his wins. } e5 {Standard.  But, now Joe is going to give up his Queen for his N.  And, with a close rating range, I am already interested in seeing what's to come.} 3. Qxf6 Qxf6 4. Nc3 {But, after he sacs, one the things Joe does is that he'll continue developing, unless there is an extenuating circumstances that would delay it.  He has implied this in his club.} c6 {I don't know why black played this.  Not only doesn't it develop, but black will either be forced to waist time to find a good outpost, or place his Nb8 on the rim.} 5. Nf3 {Therefore, Joe will waist no time in developing his pieces.} Bb4 {And, black now develops a piece.} 6. Be2 {But, Joe continues, as well.} h6 {?! Not only don't I see the point, but I deem this to be a waist of time.  That's because nothing is en-prise or threatened.  At least, not to my knowing.  If I saw any clear danger, it might be a different story.  In addition, this will make it less safe for black to castle short, as far as, I'm concerned.  Therefore, I would've played 6...d3 preparing to contest the center with a center pawn and develop the LSB.} 7. a3 {So, I guess my instincts were right.  As a consequence of black's last move, Joe plays this.  The idea being that agata will have to waist time.  And, if he doesn't white will liquidate.  Although it's generally not a good to exchange pieces when behind, I find this to be an extenuating circumstance because black's Bb4 is stronger then white Nc3, so exchanging should benefit white, which is bound to happen.} Bxc3 8. dxc3 d6 {And, now black plays the move that I mentioned earlier.  However, I still think it would've been more effective his sixth move then it is now, especially since white got to exchange, to his benefit.} 9. Be3 {With that being said, Joe completes his development.} Nd7 {Black also continues.  The only issue is that it'll take time to complete development, as we're about to see.  And, that's why I also viewed 4...c6 as pointless.  In other words, that's why I didn't see the point behind that move.} 10. Nd2 {This time, I am not completely sure why Joe moved here.  But, unlike his opponents, I am able to make more sense of his move, since tactical-abyss explains things very things.  I also base it on what Susan Polgar has previously told me.  So, it's safe to infer that white played this to bring his N to a better outpost which is very familiar to me.  Although I like it, I think, I would've castled here.  But, I don't find fault with this move, at all.} Nc5 {So, black also brings his N to a better place.} 11. O-O-O {But, I think that Joe is getting other things, in exchange for, his Q.  For example, before black can complete development, white castles.  Personally, however, I would've castled short.  So, there has to be a reason why this is better, but I am just not sure.  When it comes to tactical-abyss, it is hard to figure things out, but that is, as he mentions, good for theory.  But, theory is the way to learn.  For example, everything that I mentioned about visual imagery, where you visulaize and analyze the board without being on the computer is also part of theory.} Qe6 {Putting pressure on the e file.  But, I don't see the point.  Instead, I would've castled short or played 11...Be6  Therefore, it can't be as good, but I am not sure why.  Meanwhile, Joe will exchange.  Due to being behind, I would've hold off.  In TA's case, there are exceptions, so I gather that black's N is stronger then white's DSB.  Which if that's true, it makes sense then, as exchanging would be to his benefit.} 12. Bxc5 dxc5 13. g3 {Now, it makes sense, as to, why he didn't castle short.  Not sure the reason behind it, but Joe's plan was to play this.  Therefore, I don't know what it accomplishes, but it must be something good.} b5 {Fianchettoing, so that when black does complete his development, his B will be on a better diagnol.} 14. f4 {Joe intends to and will exchange pawns.  I don't know why he wanted to do this, but my guess is to get another passed pawn which if so, would have a potential to promote.  The idea being is that passed pawns are known to be very dangerous.} exf4 15. gxf4 O-O {And, that's when black castles, at last.} 16. h4 {I believe that Joe is already playing through some long variations and is attempting, or even, figuring out how to get another passed pawn since taking on f4 already gave him one.  That's because, if he does, then I understand the logic behind this perfectly well, as the idea is, that you should bring your R behind a passed well.  Afterall, that is a well known chess fact.  I guess, a possible continuation would then be for TA to move his LSB, and after that, play Rdf1.  It is, however, a very interesting position. } a5 {And, I gather that black has the same idea, in mind.} 17. e5 {Not exactly sure what Joe has in mind here, but, I would've played 17.f5, and when the Q retreats, that's when I'd answer with f5, and that way, we're talking about keeping a solid pawn chain, until one hits the sixth rank, where it's known to be dangerous.  But, given his style, I believe that white is planning on a way to do that.} b4 {Going for a pawn exchange because black, I believe, is thinking along the lines of 18.axb3 with the idea of undoubling his pawns after 18...cxb3, and after 19.axb3, axb3, black has an open h file which is known to be very dangerous.} 18. Nb3 {So, Joe was not going to allow, and instead, counters that by threatening to win another pawn.} Qe7 {Which black must now protect.} 19. Rd6 {So, Joe goes after another pawn.  And, black will stop that, after exchanging another set of pawns.} bxa3 20. bxa3 Be6 {Which black stops.} 21. c4 {However, I would've taken on b3, anyway, but seeing that Joe doesn't do this, I realize that it would be an inaccuracy.  I guess it's because white's N is stronger then black's B.  Therefore, this would result in losing an exchange which would not be good here.} Rfd8 {Putting pressure on the d file.} 22. Rd3 {Which Joe counters, as now, an exchange doesn't look as bad for white.} Rxd3 23. Bxd3 a4 {Hitting the N.} 24. Nd2 {And, for a change, I am not surprised to see Joe retreating here, as this is also what I would've played.} Qd7 {Putting pressure on the d file.  However, I don't see the point as the B isn't pinned.  If white's LSB were to move, black can't capture the N due to white's monarch.} 25. Nf3 {With that being said, Joe finds a better outpost for his N.} Bf5 {agata is very determined to get rid of white's B, I guess, because it poses as a danger.} 26. Re1 {But, Joe has other idea, as otherwise, he wouldn't give away his B.  So, it's safe to infer that white is giving it away, for when black takes, white would have something dangerous in mind. I'm not sure exactly what it is because, when all is said and done, black will pick up another piece.  What I do know, however, based on visual imagery, is that white is calculating something dangerous, afterwards.} Bxd3 {So, the plan starts here.} 27. e6 {That's because when black takes, white will fork and get the B, and when black takes back on c4...} fxe6 28. Ne5 Qd4 29. Nxd3 Qxc4 30. Re5 {This happens.  However, I would've captured with 30.Rxe6  But, Joe has a reason for doing what he does.  And, it's important to figure what that would be as that's what theory is about.} Qd4 {So, black plays this with the idea being to hit on white's N since ...c4 is a possiblity.} 31. Rxc5 {As a result, Joe stops that by capturing.} Rb8 {So, white has an answer that.  And, that is by threatening 32...Qa1+  Now, as Homework, I have studied it, and I found the answer, as there's no mate.  But, this was, after a lot of difficulties, putting right in the top 5 most difficult HW assignments, I've ever done.  The idea being is that black is threatening to win another pawn, which white cannot risk.  So, after 32...Qa1+, 33.Kd2 (forced), Qxa4 (immediately).} 32. Kd2 {So, Joe protects because if 32...Qa1, white now answers with 32.Ra5} Rb1 {Therefore, black has other ideas, but I'm not sure what they are.  The reason why I don't know is that ...Qa1 followed by ...Rd1+ isn't mate, as white would be able to get out with Ke3  But, agata has something up his sleeve, for sure.} 33. Rxc6 {So, Joe takes.} Qe4 {Like before, black intends to do something.  But, this time, he intends to win white's R.} 34. Rc8+ {As Joe is not going to give anything else away, he places black in check.  And, when agata gets out, that is when white will centralize his K.  That's right, the idea is that, in the endgame, when you're at a disadvantage, you want to bring the monarch closer to the center.  In doing so, you will last longer.  And, yes, it is something that I taught one of my students.} Kh7 {It is a little too early to tell, but my inference is that we're going into the same category as what I know about standard endgames.  That, black is intending to form a fortress where white's K would be locked in the corner.  The reason is that one generally confines the K to one square until you can force a mate.  I think that this is what black intends to do.  The only other reason for this inference is that, aside from that, I have no idea why else agata would move here.  So, I was trying to do a little Homework here by forming a hypothesis. } 35. Kc3 {But, is my instincts are right, Joe has prevented that.} Qd5 {Of course, black has other ideas.  But, this time, not only do I have no idea but can't even guess.  } 36. Rc4 {But, as usual, Joe does since he can calculates variations.  And, when this happens, the immediate response shows.} Rb5 {Like before, black is threatening to do something.} 37. Rxa4 {So, white takes.} Qc6+ {And, black checks.} 38. Rc4 {And, Joe gets out by interceding a piece.  Personally, I would've played 38.Kd2, so it can't be as good, given that white didn't respond that way.  In fact, I know why because from visualization and seeing what happens next, white will, for the most part, fully recompensate for lost material.  In addition, I also remember something important from GM Susan Polgar.  During an e-mail course (that I took) she said that when in check, one should not assume that the way to get out is with the King.  Instead, it is, sometimes, better to interpose a piece which makes sense here and for the reason mentioned earlier.} Rc5 {To minimize the damage, black brings his R to c5.  For had he not, Joe would've won back the Q, but now, he is only getting a R.  Although that's significant, it's certainly a lot better then losing the Queen.} 39. Rxc5 Qe4 {And, of course, black dare not take for the obvious reason, so agata moved here, instead.} 40. Ra5 {But, I am not sure why Joe played this.  Meanwhile, black will deliver some annoying checks.} Qc6+ 41. Kd2 Qg2+ 42. Kc3 {It is worth noting that the monarch is a powerful weapon during the endgame.  So, my guess is that Joe moved here to make his K dangerous.} Qh2 {Going right after h3.} 43. Kb3 {Given what I mentioned, Joe allows black to take.  In addition, with this move, we have now accomplished triangulation (which is the trigonometric method).  The idea being that white's K moved to d2, followed c3, and then b3, so it has moved in a triangle.  Now, this is very effective in an endgame.} Qxh4 44. Kc3 {Continuing the triangulation.} Qf6+ {And, black decides to check.} 45. Kb3 {Another option was to interpose with 45.Ne5, or 45.Re5, but I don't like those two, as well, as now one of the pieces would remain pin.  Therefore, this move is also what I would've played, and in it's important to remember that Joe is still triangulating.} Qg6 {I am not sure why black this, as white's N is not pinned, for if it moved, agata could not take, due to white's N.} 46. Ka2 {Continuing the triangulation.  But, in this case, I would not have played it, as now, the N is really pinned.  However, due to to Joe's rating, it's important to try to figure it out, as this still blends in with theory.  So, my guess is that he moved here to add an extra defender to his c2 pawn.} h5 {With one of his passed pawns, agata attempts to promote.} 47. Kb1 {But, Joe will stop at nothing to prevent that.  And, that is especially because of what I noted earlier, about centralization as white is centralizing his K.  The idea is that he'll move it towards and passed the center with the idea of making right near the pawn.  That way, if black were to advance too far, white would just take that pawn.  It does require a lot of moves, though, but it's good practice because I am calculating possible variations.} h4 {Which starts here, as this is the move that I predicted.} 48. Kb2 {But, this, however, is not a move that was in my calculation.  Instead, my inference was that Joe would play 48.Kc1, and if 48...h3  However, my variations fail because after 49.Kd1, h2, now the pawn will promote after 50.Ke1  Therefore, I'm interested in knowing how this stops the promotion.  That's because another move that comes to mind (which appears to work) was the immediate 48.Nf2, to prevent 48...h3  However, once black plays that, this is when white will bring his N to f2.  } h3 49. Nf2 h2 {However, it now makes sense because this will also stop the promotion.} 50. Kb3 {?? Unlike before, I don't know why Joe played this, but my guess would be to continue with his triangulation.  However, black can and will win the N.  On the other hand, it's worth noting that, according to what tactical-abyss implied taking the N is where black will start to go wrong.  That's because he said that black was winning, until the last few moves, which is we're we have arrived.} Qg3+ 51. Kb2 Qxf2 52. Kb3 {However, it starts making sense because, if black were to Queen, Joe would continue to advance his c pawn until it surpasses the 5th rank, then a possible continuation would bringing the R up and placing black in check, followed by, advancing the a pawn.  So, although it looks like black is clearly going to win, I'm going by what TA stated due to the fact that chess is a complex game.  In fact, we start seeing that on the next move, when black delivers check, as opposed to, promotion.} Qe3+ 53. Kb4 {Keeping his a3 and c2 pawns protected.} Qd4+ {Once again, black decides to put pressure right on white's monarch.  Personally, I would've done that, but with 53...Qxf4+, as now, I don't see anything wrong with it.  Afterall, white would still in check, so black would get something else.  Therefore, my hypothesis is that black is running out of time which when that happens, you don't concentrate, as well.  I know because I was clearly winning against my student, Mary, but in the end, I made a grave mistake that lost as I was running low on time.} 54. Kb3 {Protecting one of his passed pawns, for had Joe played 54.Kb5 (which was the only other option), black has 54...Qb2+, in which the c2 pawn would fall.  After that, I believe that it would be lights out, for white.} Qd5+ {?? My guess is that black wanted to put extra pressure on white.  But, the problem is that this gives away the Q for a R.  By then, white, I think, would clearly win.  As noted before, however, mistakes or blunders often happen, when you're running low on time.  In fact, that's one reason I don't play blitz that often, though, it might start realizing that they're in seperate categories from long correspondence chess games.  And, I recently got tips from TA on how to play blitz, without feeling rushed in my actual games.} 55. Kb2 {Talk about time management, were we not low on this, I think that white would've played 55.Rxd5  But, in this case, it doesn't matter because black timed out.  Joe said, as noted, that, up until the last 5 moves, black was clearly winning.  But, things changed, towards the end, and had there been plenty of time, like several days, he would've won.  With almost any other chess player, I'd disagree but not with tactical-abyss.  The idea being is that he really knows his theory.  And, in doing so he calculates and visualizes more variations then any of us, as Joe sees things differently.  As usual, however, I'm glad that I took the time to study another Q sac, especially of this kind for Homework.  Once again, it shows just how much there really is to learn, as he points out in a threat.  The thread was actually on the topic, and in it, he presented this game.  The idea being is that a lot of people say that Joe only wins because he played against much lower rated players.  But, with this game, I know that it isn't so because, in this case, he played against someone of about his strength, sacced his Q (as usual) and still won.  In addition, one of the main ways that I've improved was by studying games like this.  As a result, this is also how I was able to teach chess to one of my students.  That's because she used to resign just by being a minor piece down.  But, after remembering what Jack Stockel, as well as, TA's Q sac's, I convinced her not to resign.  She remembered that and got a stalemate, in what was, a lost position.  And, in a different game, the student had another lost position, but her opponent failed to take her Q after making another big mistake.  In doing so, and after more blunders, my student was able to pull a swindle by winning a game that ought to have been lost.}
