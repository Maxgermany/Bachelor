1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. f4 {6.f4 the Levenfish attack , as I explained , the idea of the move 6.f4 is to advance to e5 and ( maybe latter to e6) , to get activity and space advantage and push the black Pisces to passive positions , in the game in the Bialik championship 2013 vs Nachum Mautner was played 6...Bg7.8.e5!-dxe.9.fxe-Ng4?.10.Bb5+.. and I won easily .} Nc6 {good move , black develops the knight and the same time defends the e5 square and now if white doesn't want blacks next move Bg7 , he should trade the knight on c6 and open the B file for the rook . for example : 6...Nc6 .7. Nxc6-bxc6.8.e5-Nd7.9.exd (the idea is to force black to move his bishop to e7 and not to g7 because of the weak pawn on d6 )-exd and black is fine ... but have some troubles with the weakens on d6 ....} 7. Nxc6 bxc6 8. Bd3 {it is playable move but 8.e5 was better because of the idea to stop blacks Bg7 as we saw earlier .} Rb8 {good move , black enters his rook to the game , black now controls the B file and make some difficultys for white to develop his DSB because his b2 pawn will be under attack . } 9. O-O Bg7 {black is slightly better now , he controls the B file ,blacks Pisces placed well the bishop on g7 controls the long diagonal h8-a1 and almost have no weakness the pawn on c6 is unprotected but white cant get to him so quick . } 10. b3 {Inaccuracy , White should protect his pawn on e4  first by 10.Qe1 , and the white knight is now unprotected and the rook on a1 cant be expose to the attack by the bishop on g7 . black now starts to take the advantange because of the expose diagonal h8-a1 . } Nxe4 11. Bxe4 Bxc3 12. Rb1 {white could capture the pawn on c6 with check and than move the rook to b1 , and steel black lost his weak pawn c6 and won the strong central pawn on e4 and forcing white to trade his strong LSB . blacks position is very well here .} d5 13. Bf3 {Another inaccuracy , better move was 13. Bd3 and the idea is to prevent black to activate his LSB to a6 or f5 , after blacks 12...d5! there is nothing to do for the bishop on f3 , whites Pisces are misplaced here . black is simply with extra pawn and better position .} O-O 14. Bb2 { Good move , white cant affored to keep the killer bishop alive , he must destroy it . but with extra pawn left , and because of the low chances for whites attack on the black king because of missplaced whites pisces , even atrade of so powerful bishop its ok for black .} Qa5 {the black queen defends the bishop and stops white to activate hs queene to powerful squre d4 . } 15. Bxc3 Qxc3 16. Qd3 Qxd3 {16...Qc5+ was better , after .17.Rf2-Bf5.18.Qd2 and blacks position was much better , and when you have material advantage you should trade Pisces as many as you can but the problem is that white now have some chances to contra play .} 17. cxd3 Bf5 18. Be2 h5 {the idea is to stop white playing 19.g4 -Bd7 .20.d4! and white starting to get some compinsation for the lost pawn , white have open C file and create some presure on the weak c6 pawn by doubleing the rooks on the C file  Rfc1 c5 Rbc1 and black must move his forces to diffend the c pawn and the winnig of the game is not clear at all .} 19. h3 h4 {good move ! now 20.g4 is usless because of 20...h4xg3 U.P.  } 20. Rf3 {20. Rbc1 was much better , white have to control his open C file and start pressure the weak pawn on c6 , 20...Rfc8 .21.d4-Rb6.22. Rc5-Kf8.23.Rfc1 ext ext ....} d4 {the idea is to block the d pawn and play Rfc8 followed by c5 ...} 21. g4 hxg3 e.p. 22. Rxg3 c5 23. h4 Rb6 {Inaccuracy , A better move was 23...c4! with the idea cxb .. after  Rxb3-Rxb3 axb3- Rb8  Bd1- a5 and black with winning position or even 24... c3 25. Rc1-Rc8 ...} 24. h5 {Much better was 24.Bg4 with the idea to prevent black to play c4 , if 24...c4 ?? .25.Bxf5 ! and g6 is pined and if 24...Bxg4.25.Rxg4 -Rc8 .26.Rc1 and it seens that black have to find agood plan to win this game .} Kg7 25. Kg2 {white doesnt pay attention to his important c file he shuold be more aggressive 25.Rc1!was much better !} Re6 {inaccuracy , because time control presure again i missed the srong move 25...c4 ! } 26. Kf2 Rc8 27. Rh1 Rc7 {27...Rc7 ! was better , because of the time i missed it aggain .} 28. h6+ Kh7 29. Bg4 Bxg4 30. Rxg4 Re3 31. Rg3 Rxg3 32. Kxg3 Rc6 {good move , if black wants to win this game he must be active , the idea is Ra6 .} 33. Kf3 Re6 34. Rd1 Kxh6 35. a3 f5 36. b4 Rc6 {Amistake : activity is the key 36...Re3+! 37.Kf2-cxb.38.axb-Kh5.39.Rh1+Kg4.40.Rg1+Kxf4.41.Rxg6-Rxd3 ...} 37. b5 Re6 38. a4 a6 39. Rc1 axb5 40. axb5 Re3+ 41. Kf2 Rxd3 42. Rxc5 Rb3 {good move , stopping whites passing pawn and make room for mien passing pawn .} 43. Re5 e6 {better was 43...Kh5 the roll of the king in the endgame is very important , in the endgame the king must be active !! } 44. Ke2 Kh5 45. Rxe6 Rxb5 46. Kd3 Rb4 47. Re1 Kg4 {goode move ,the black king comming foward !! , attacking the f pawn white chances to keep the position are almost over .} 48. Rf1 Kg3 49. Rg1+ Kxf4 50. Rxg6 Ke5 51. Rg1 Rb3+ 52. Kc2 Re3 53. Kd2 Ke4 {much better was 53...f4 ! but steel black is wining } 54. Rf1 f4 55. Rf2 d3 56. Rf1 f3 {the end is near !!!} 57. Ra1 Re2+ 58. Kd1 {Final mistake black can chackmate the king in 4 moves , better was 58.Kc3 and it seems that the position is lost any way but I Had few seconds left and may be after 58.Kc3 I am not sure if i have enough time to win the game :)} f2 59. Ra4+ Ke3 60. Re4+ Kxe4 61. Kc1 {and with 2 seconds left ...} f1=Q# {thank you , hope you enjoyed the game i would like to hear your thoughts on my game :)}
