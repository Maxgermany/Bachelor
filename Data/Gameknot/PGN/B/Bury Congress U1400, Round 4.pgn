1. e4 {Hi everyone, I return for the penultimate game.  After this game, which starts at 11 am there will be a break for lunch and then back at two o' clock for the final game.  After that there will be the presentation and then time to go home.} c5 2. f4 {2. f4 - another Grand Prix!} Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Bg7 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. Bd3 {7. Bd3? - this natural developing move turns out to be a bleating mistake - I think c3 was a better move here and on the next turn where I castle into it.} e6 8. O-O Bxb2 9. Bxb2 Qb6+ 10. Kh1 Qxb2 11. Qd2 Nf6 {11. ...............Nf6 - if Qxa1 then Nc3 traps her!} 12. Nc3 {12. Nc3 - develops a piece but I am now a pawn down.  I try to counter-attack but it all goes pear shape.} Qa3 13. Rfb1 O-O 14. Rb3 Qa5 {14. .......... Qa5 - the Wicked Witch is driven back, but she can swing over to the kingside.} 15. f5 Ba6 16. Bxa6 Qxa6 17. Rab1 Qa5 18. Qg5 Qe5 19. h4 Kg7 20. g4 h6 {20. ................ h6 - Glenda must retreat but she leaves the g5 pawn hanging.} 21. Qd2 Nxg4 {21. ................. Nxg4 - with disastrous results!} 22. Qe2 Qg3 23. f6+ Kh7 24. Na4 {24. Na4?? - discovering an attack on the Wicked Witch but her steed can come in on f2 with check.} Nf2+ {24. .................. Nf2  - here I threw in the sponge because Qxf2 is white's only legal move and that drops the queen.  It was after this game that Glenda went into her shell and from this day onwards she was either exchanged off early or if on the board, seen defending things.  Hence she is known to me as Glenda The Defender.  However, write here off at your peril my friends as every once in a while she can become Glenda The Offender!  Thankfully this was to be my only defeat in the tournament.}
