[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03), four pawns attack, Planinc variation"]

1. e4 {I open with e4 quite often, as I like open games and love playing the King's Gambit in blitz games here on GameKnot.} Nf6 {Okay, my opponent decides to play Alekhine's defence, no open game.} 2. e5 {Provoking another knight move.} Nd5 3. d4 {Establishes a strong pawn center...} d6 {...which Black will usually try to smash up as soon as possible.} 4. c4 {Okay, time to provoke another knight move.} Nb6 5. f4 {The four pawns attack suits my taste. Unfortunately, my decent opening theory knowledge ends at this point. I guess it's time to develop some minor pieces!} g5 {I was very surprised by this move as I haven't seen it before. According to the GameKnot opening database it's called the "Planinc variation".} 6. Nf3 {After 6. fxg5 Black could destroy my pawn center immediately with 6... dxe5, so I decided to attack that pawn another time by developing a minor piece.} Bg4 {Pins my knight.} 7. h3 {I figured out that Black should now be forced to take my knight (or retreat somewhere on the c8-h3 diagonal), otherwise his bishop is lost. I would retake with my queen, which would have a nice place on f3, attacking b7 and being on the f-file which could get very powerful after castling short, like in the King's Gambit. Furthermore, I'd own the pair of bishops.} Bh5 {?! Interesting, he neither takes my knight nor retreats to the queenside.} 8. g4 {The happy bishop hunting begins! At this time I was a bit unsure of this move because it seems my King could have a hard time finding a safe place after all those pawn moves...} Bg6 9. Nxg5 {I should have played 9. f5 immediately, I don't know why I considered this knight move to be more important. Now Black has one last chance to save the bishop.} dxe5 {? Black could have saved his bishop with 9... Bxb1.} 10. f5 {Now or never!} f6 {Defending the attack with a counter-attack. This creates the possibility to retreat to f7 after I move my knight which is attacked.} 11. Ne6 {! Fortunately, the knight has a superb square on the sixth rank where it attacks the queen, so Black has no time to save the bishop.} Qd6 {Now taking the bishop doesn't bring in any material advantage because my knight could be taken by the queen afterwards (12. fxg6 Qxe6).} 12. c5 {Creating a nice fork. At this point three of Black's pieces are attacked, material loss can't be avoided.} Qd5 {?? The intention was to attack my rook on h1. This enables my power horse on e6 to...} 13. Nxc7+ {... fork another time! Black resigned at this point. It was amazing, I guess I hardly ever won a game just with the power of one minor piece and pawn moves. And that against a 2000+ rated player. Either the rating doesn't correspond to his real strength or he had a really bad day. But what I wanted to demonstrate with that short annotation: everything is possible, especially in blitz games, don't discourage yourself from the beginning just because your opponent has a *much* higher rating!}
