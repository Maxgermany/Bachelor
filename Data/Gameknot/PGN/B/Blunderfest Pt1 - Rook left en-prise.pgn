1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I thought I would talk to you about chess blunders.  Don't we all get that horrid sinking feeling when we have made a blunder.  Well, thankfully it was my opponent that blundered.  I got into my usual jstevens1 type position and the disease passivitis struck again - incredibly my 1700+ opponent failed to take full advantage and later on he made a serious oversight which brought about instant resignation - well less talk - more action.  After getting used to the Sicilian Defense I find myself fronted with the French.} e6 {1...... e6 - voila!  This is the French Defense.  The purpose of this move is to support d5.  If pawns are exchanged on d5 you get the Exchange Variation where black has a pawn controlling e4 and c4.} 2. d4 Nf6 {2....... Nf6 - unusual.} 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 {5. e5 - transposes into an Advanced French type setup.} Nfd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 {7. f4 - maintaining strong pawn centre.} a6 8. Nf3 c5 9. dxc5 Qxc5 10. Qd2 Nc6 11. Bd3 {11. Bd3 - over the last few moves - development.  I am unable to castle kingside however due to the presence of the Wicked Witch of the West on c5 controlling g8.  As it turns out, Henry is safe where he is.} b5 12. a3 Bb7 13. b4 Qb6 14. Qf2 Qxf2+ 15. Kxf2 {15. Kxf2 - after a bit of expansion on the queenside the queens are exchanged.  There are a few surprises in this quiet position and for me, not very pleasant.  I am about to cede control of the c file.} Rc8 16. Ne2 Ke7 17. Ned4 Nxd4 18. Nxd4 g6 19. Rac1 Rc3 {19....... Rc3 - nasty, nasty, the pawn on a3 is hanging so my rook has to go back to a1.  In retrospect my king rook should have gone to c1 instead of my queen rook.} 20. Rca1 Rhc8 21. Rhb1 Nb6 22. Rb3 Na4 {22........ Na4 - now in comes his horsie.} 23. Rab1 Rxb3 24. Rxb3 Nc3 {24. ........ Nc3 - after one pair of rooks has been exchanged the horsie invades further into my position.  Henry, however thinks he can be booted out so he heads for d2 via e1.} 25. Ke1 Na4 {25. ........ Na4 - the knight retreats voluntarily.} 26. Kd2 {26. Kd2 - as planned.} Nb6 27. Rc3 Nc4+ 28. Bxc4 dxc4 29. g3 {29. g3 - after Fou Leblanc sacrifices himself for that pestilent horsie I play g3 to dodge the attack of black's long range light square bishop on b7.  My own horsie is about to be put in a really nasty pin.} Rd8 30. Ke3 f6 {30. ....... f6! - good move, forces an exchange which draws the enemy king into my position.} 31. exf6+ Kxf6 32. a4 {32. a4?! - a speculative pawn sac to try and break up black's queenside pawns.  Black ignores the a pawn and forces an exchange of pawns on e5.} e5 33. fxe5+ Kxe5 34. Ne2 {34. Ne2 - I have a choice of f3 or e2 - my gut feeling tells me that e2 is the right move.} Rd1 {34. ........ Rd1 - natural - wanting to invade deep into the heart of my position, but why not bxa4?} 35. axb5 axb5 36. Ra3 {36. Ra3 - I decided to initiate the exchange of pawns myself and to counter-attack with my rook down the newly opened a file threatening a skewer on a7.  Black moves his king to d6 so that if Ra7, Kc7.  I now play my knight to c3 and wait for it ........} Kd6 37. Nc3 Kc6 {37....... Kc6?? - now!  The rook on d1 is en prise!  My horsie says thank you very much.  I had to wait 2 or 3 days for my opponent to come on line again.  It was worth waiting for because I bagged 9 lucky points!  To date in my 1700-1800 mini-tourney I have 7 points out of 9 games.} 38. Nxd1 {}
