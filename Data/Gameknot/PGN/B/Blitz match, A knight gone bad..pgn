1. d4 {Go back a move to see more details.} d5 2. e3 e6 {Not exactly standered but not bad, queen openings were never my favorite.} 3. Nf3 c5 {3 pawn moves in a row, I should think about getting those minor pieces out instead.} 4. c3 {An okay defence...highly passive though. } Nc6 5. a3 {Too many pawn moves for white. Although his position looks solid, he is behind devolopement wise and will have a very cramped game.} Nf6 6. b4 {Another pawn move? The time is ripe to land my knight on b3.} c4 {This puts a pawn in white territory which cannot be traded off and incidently will be very useful for supporting the knight when I put it on b3.} 7. b5 {Over extending...this proves destructive.} Na5 8. h3 {Nbd2 is a must. The knight cannot be allowed on b3.} Nb3 {What are knights for but cramping your opponents style?} 9. Ra2 {Crampage.} Bd7 {That b5 pawn just isn't going to survive.} 10. a4 a6 {Winning a pawn.} 11. b6 {The pawn loss is unavoidable. 11. bxa6 Rxa6 12. ... Bxa4 makes a nasty discovery on white's queen.} Qxb6 {What else is there?} 12. Nbd2 {This knight needed to be there a few moves earlier.} Nxc1 {Just to mess up his devolopement some more...} 13. Qxc1 Bd6 14. a5 {not a bad move...but if I were him I'd stop the pawn moves and get the minor pieces out.} Qc7 15. Be2 O-O 16. Nf1 {16. O-O is what he should have done 16 ... Bh2  doesn't do anything because of 17. Nxh2.} Bb5 {The bishop does nothing more on b5, I was just wasting a move to see if he would do his next move.} 17. Ng3 {This destroys White's position and any hope of castling.} Bxg3 {The attack begins...} 18. fxg3 Qxg3+ 19. Kd2 {19. Kf1 is the proper defence and would avoid all this trouble since 20. Qe1 would take care of 19. ... Ne4.} Ne4+ 20. Kc2 Qxg2 {Justified. White's position is cracked and cannot be repaired. My knight is at the perfect place to conquer the queenside.} 21. Kb1 {A good defence, except now I can do...} Nxc3+ {The knight is invincible. 22. Qxc3 results in 22. ... Qxh1  followed by 23. ... Qxh3.} 22. Ka1 {The only way to refuse taking the knight. 22. Kb2 Qxe2 23. Kxc3 Qxf3. and white is down a minor piece and four pawns.} Nxa2 {The knight is still invincible. 23 Kxa2 Qxe2  24. Ka1 Qxf3 and I am up a lot of material!} 23. Qd1 {23. Qe1 would have been a better chioce.} Nc3 24. Qe1 Qxe2 {Time to trade off all the material. He must take my queen or I will play 25. Qa2#. The only way to stop 25. Qa2# is to play 25. Qd2 which results in 25. ... Qxc3 and once again he cannot take my knight due to the threat of 26. ... Qxh1 . His only other option is to play 25. Nd2 which would have been his best choice since 25. ... Qxe1 26. Rxe1 and his pieces are at better places.} 25. Qxe2 Nxe2 26. Rh2 {Played immedietly.} c3 {Defending the knight and pushing a pawn.  0-1  The position just isn't looking good for white on all levels. This game was a mismatch so it isn't an accomplishment, except that Nxc3  seems to shatter the position and is worth noting.  5:40-7:09}
