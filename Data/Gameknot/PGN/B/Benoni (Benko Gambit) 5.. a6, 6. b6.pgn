1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 4. Nf3 g6 5. cxb5 a6 6. b6 {This move used to take white away from mainline theory, before 6. b6 became mainline theory also} d6 7. Nc3 Qxb6 8. e4 Bg7 9. Nd2 O-O 10. Be2 a5 {A common theme in this line. Black's plan is primitive: ..a5, then ..c4 later (restricting white's space on the queenside), followed by doubling or tripling major pieces on the b-file. The idea is to win either white's b or e-pawn to equalise on material, and then keep the initiative to make a breakthrough.   } 11. Nc4 {Thematic for white. White wants to restrict black's movements on the queenside and press ahead with his play in the center. Threatening the black queen and a5 pawn forces black to play accurately. Nc4 also compliments a later f4, and either e5 or f5 pawn push} Qd8 {Other squares are possible for the queen, but I like this simple retreat. Black will choose the best square for his queen later once minor pieces are deployed and white's intentions are clear. For example, ..Qc7 looks ok, but is anti-thematic as it allows white moves like Nb5 and a4. This is ok for black, but takes the game into different territory} 12. O-O Ba6 {Thematic. After white plays Ne3, the light square bishops are often exchanged giving black a little more space on the queenside to proceed with his plans} 13. Bg5 {A logical position for the bishop, if white chooses to play either Qd2 or f4 later (when the bishop is outside the pawn chain)} Nbd7 {At this point black has a classic benko piece placement. I would say in over 50% of games black could expect to arrive at this piece setup (irrespective of white's plans). This makes the opening easy for black to play for the first 12 or so moves} 14. Qc2 {Classic position for the queen. Ne3 was also possible} Bxc4 {The knight will prove troublesome to black. He exchanges, intending to push ..c4 in a few moves, move his knight to c5, and build a 2-pronged attack against e4 and b2. This also frees the b6 square for the queen later (which can gain a tempo with check should white play f4 as is common in Bg5 lines)} 15. Bxc4 Ne5 {This is also a common square for the black knight in the benko. Black wants white to play f4 at some stage chasing his piece away, as the knight is just passing through. The extra tempo will be important later} 16. Be2 c4 {The first phase of black's plan is complete. Free the c5 square for his knight. This involves the loss of the c pawn (the knight cannot expect to live on e5 for long) but the counterplay he gets is worth it} 17. Na4 {White plays to win the pawn. The knight also prevents a later queen check on b6, and offers the possibility of Be3 (working on the b6 square). Black must deal with all threats} Rb8 {1 attacker on b2. And importantly the rook plans to move to b4 so black can double his major pieces} 18. f4 {Thematic} Nd3 {Offering a pawn} 19. Bxd3 cxd3 20. Qxd3 Rb4 {Important} 21. Nc3 { } Nd7 {21.. Ng4 is also interesting, with the idea of ..Qb6+, Kh1 Ne3. After looking at many lines (including interesting ones with the black rook on b2 being sacrificed on g2) I came to the conclusion that ..Nd7 was more dynamic, with interesting ..Nc5 lines gaining a tempo against the white queen followed by ..Nxe4 (killing white's winning chances). In comparison ..Ng4 was too committing and impatient. } 22. Rab1 {Or another plan would be 22.f5 Nc5 23.Qh3 Rxb2 24.Bh6 Qb6 25.Bxg7 Kxg7 26.fxg6 hxg6 27.Qe3} Qb6+ {Doubling (with gain of tempo)} 23. Kh1 Nc5 {Attacking e4 with gain of tempo} 24. Qc2 Rb8 {Tripling and crushing positionally. This position looks quite contrived, with every black piece participating harmonically in the attack on the queenside. Yet it is a textbook setup in the benko, and one of the ways black converts his extra tempos into material gain. The danger to white is not black winning his pawn back, but the initiative he carries. Observe at this point the risks to white. 1) After losing e4 to the black knight, the d5 pawn is weak also 2) The black queen and knight are targetting the f2 square, white needs to be careful} 25. b3 Bxc3 {Forcing the win of the e4 pawn. After winning e4, black now has the additional threat of playing ..a4 and continuing his plan of crushing white. Note the opportunity black has of using his knight on f2 to deflect a major white piece} 26. Qxc3 Nxe4 27. Qc2 Qb7 28. Rbd1 a4 29. bxa4 Rc8 30. Qd3 Rc3 {.} 31. Qe2 f5 {The knight is now unmovable} 32. Bh4 Rb2 33. Qe1 Rxa2 34. Ra1 Rac2 35. Rd1 Qb2 36. Rb1 Qa2 37. Rg1 {This gives black the possibility of a smothered mate on f2, if he can deflect the queen and the bishop} Rh3 38. Rb4 Re2 39. Qxe2 Qxe2 40. gxh3 Qf3+ 41. Rg2 Qxf4 {Removing the pawn. Black's simplest win comes from pushing his f-pawn} 42. Be1 Qf1+ 43. Rg1 Qf3+ 44. Rg2 Ng5 45. Rb1 Nxh3 46. Bd2 f4 47. Rb8+ Kf7 48. Rb1 Qd3 49. Ra1 f3 50. Rg3 Nf2+ 51. Kg1 Qe2 52. h4 Nd1 53. Rxf3+ Qxf3 54. Be1 Qe3+ 55. Kf1 Qd3+ 56. Kg1 Qd4+ 57. Kf1 Qxa1 {}
