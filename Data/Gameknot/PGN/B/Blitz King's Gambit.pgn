[Opening "King's knight's gambit (C38)"]

1. e4 {Hey all! Just a quick annotation over lunch; nothing too in-depth but I thought this would be an enjoyable game to take a look at. Many thanks to my opponent!} e5 2. f4 {The King's Gambit! One of my favorite openings on both sides of the board. It's very rare to see a dull game in this opening.} exf4 {"The refutation of any gambit begins by accepting it." Not that I intend to refute the KG, but at least Mr. Fischer agrees with me that 2...exf4 is best.} 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 Bg7 5. d4 {All very by-the-book. I should mention that I played several games against this opponent; this was one of the later ones and the opening was played quite rapidly as we'd already played it out a couple of times at this point.} h6 {Bolstering g5 in preparation for developing the KN. This is still standard play in lines where Black seeks to hold on to the gambit pawn.} 6. Nc3 d6 7. h3 {The first game we played, White played 7.Bxf7+?! in this position. I ended up with a crushing lead, and I think this time he was feeling somewhat too cautious. More common are 7.h4, 7.g3, or simply 7.O-O.} Ne7 {Ready to deploy to g6, f5, or maybe c6, depending on how things unfold.} 8. e5 {I probably would have castled first, but this is still fine. It does make f5 an enticing spot for Black's Knight, however.} d5 9. Bb5+ {I'm not sure how to feel about this. On the one hand, it invites Black to bottle up his forces with 9...c6, making development slightly more difficult. On the other hand, it doesn't accomplish a whole lot, and Black's QN frequently ends up aiding on the kingside via d7 anyway, so this check may not accomplish much of anything.} c6 10. Ba4 O-O {I always feel especially daring castling kingside in this opening.} 11. Bd2 {This Bishop doesn't have many prospects--one of the reasons White usually tries to break up Black's kingside pawn chain earlier than this.} a5 12. a3 {Preventing the Bishop from getting trapped (by 12...b5 13.Bb3 a4).} Be6 {This is an ugly spot for the Bishop, but Black intends to reposition it after dealing with the e-pawn. For now, the Bishop serves merely as a blockade.} 13. Qe2 {Preparing for queenside castling.} Nf5 {Finally arriving on this comfortable outpost--with the threat of leaping to g3 and winning a crucial exchange as the game heats up and lines begin to open.} 14. O-O-O {? Overlooking Black's threat.} Ng3 15. Qf2 Nxh1 16. Rxh1 Nd7 {Intending to assist pushed on f6 or c5.} 17. h4 f6 18. hxg5 fxg5 19. Ne2 {Transferring forces to the kingside. White is firmly behind now, so he has to see if he can make Black pay for his overextended kingside pawns.} b5 {Black responds with a queenside counter.} 20. Bb3 c5 {?! Questionable at best, but Black really wants to break up White's center and let his Bishops get into the action.} 21. c3 cxd4 {? Probably 21...Rc8 or 21...c4 were better. Remember, this is blitz, and both players are starting to run low on time, but the text gives White some real equalizing chances.} 22. Nexd4 Bf7 {? Black miscalculates his resources, thinking to respond to 23.e6 with ...Bxd4 and ...Bxe6, but that simply does not work.} 23. e6 Bxd4 24. Nxd4 Bg6 {White has just about equalized. After 25.exd7 Qxd7 26.Rxh6, White will be in quite good shape.} 25. Bxd5 {...but time pressure makes fools of us all. This looks strong--grabbing a pawn and compounding the threats against Black's position by striking at the Rook and threatening 26.e7+! winning the BQ as well. But Black has a little more time on the clock--enough to find an effective resource. 25.exd7 etc was better and simpler.} Ne5 {In the face of the multiple threats on the table, this move isn't obvious--until you notice that the Bd5 is undefended. That fact largely neutralizes the available threats, and while White will still come out better than he was, it's nowhere near the strong position he would have had by just taking the Knight. Now, not only is Black threatening the Bishop, but his Knight also leers down at d3, ready for a royal fork if given the opportunity.} 26. e7+ {This is still White's best option, I think.} Qxd5 27. exf8=Q+ Rxf8 {At this point, the players are basically equal in material and have less than a minute on their clocks, but Black's positional advantages are huge, he's still threatening ...Nd3+, and the WK is suddenly looking pretty exposed. What is White to do?} 28. Qe2 {Innocuous-looking, but I think this actually loses due to the WK's perilous positioning. White had to deal with the potential fork, but I think the right way to go about it was by hiking the King back towards the kingside with 28.Kd1. Certainly he's still in some serious trouble, but (time pressure aside) he might be able to play to a draw from here if he's careful and gets some good counterplay on the kingside. As it stands, I don't see a direct win, but Black certainly has a strong play...} Qa2 {0-1. Here White timed out looking for a response. The best move looks to be 29.Kd1, where I think White has enough outstanding threats to keep Black from clamping down on a mate, thanks largely to the heroic Nd4. There are several variations after 29.Kd1, but the gist of them all is that as long as the Nd4 controls b3 and c2, Black can't finish the mate, and he'll have to back off after maybe winning a pawn or two in order to defend his own King.  Many thanks to romcyte54 for some very enjoyable games; I only regret we didn't get to see this one through to the end. Comments are much appreciated, and thanks for reading!}
