1. f4 {my prefered : bird opening. It makes stranges situations and a lot of interesting opportunities.} d5 2. c4 {this is also my prefered variation against 1. f4 - d5 if black take it, things will become hard for them !} dxc4 3. e3 {i choose this e3 to keep a strong position in the center, more risky whould be e4, but because i had lose 2 times first whith this challenger, i prefer to keep safety} b5 {i like this way, black are going to keep there c4 pawn...i i will try to kill it attacking to the queen side. After when i will castle, with my rooq taking the f colon, it must give some good oportunities} 4. b3 {one way to attack it : 4. ... - c4xb3 5.d1xc3 treats b5+ and f7 for after, and kill any black center. So black cannot reasonably take it} Ba6 {so they gon on defending there weakless position} 5. bxc4 {the plan is to put my queen in a4 after} c6 {they go on defending} 6. Nf3 {i have to develop some more, and maybe preparing an attack to f7...} Nf6 {developp} 7. Nc3 {developp} e6 {preparing castle} 8. d4 {so now the center is MINE ! i have to castle quickly} bxc4 {black finally decided to take this bloody c4 pawn ! so i will be abble to get out my queen} 9. Qa4 {here i am !} Bd6 {of course black has to castle quikly to cancel the treat a4 / e8} 10. Bxc4 {i have to castle also, so i} Bxc4 11. Qxc4 {very strong white center, queen in good position whith no immediat treat possible} O-O {free tempo to castle for white} 12. O-O a5 {to get out the b8 knight and maybe to move Bb4} 13. Ne5 {treat c6 and hoping bishop will take it, then it opens my f colon and still and very strong pawn structure (e3-d4-e5)} Qc7 {defends c6} 14. a4 {block the a4 pawn and prepare move possibility for the c1 bishop to treat the a3 f8 diagonale} Na6 {in way to occupe the b colon and getting out his knight} 15. f5 {and need to open my f colon to have opportunities to attack black castle. This is risky, i know, but the game was static. Wee need movment to have oportunities} Bxe5 {of course this was the risk, but it is not so serious, after d4xe5 if the queen take back i will take c6 with mine ! and i can go on f5xe6 ...e6xf7+!} 16. dxe5 Nd5 17. fxe6 {pawn attack !} Nab4 {protecting c6 and d5. this is strong.} 18. exf7+ {i like this !} Rxf7 19. Rxf7 Kxf7 {i m not sure about that : was is a black bunder or was it the better choice ? help somebody ? I whould take back with the c7 queen if i was blacks, now the black king is exposed, isnt it ?} 20. Nxd5 {now Nxd5 is the only choice, and then the black queen will not have the time  to take e6 treatening a1} Nxd5 21. e6+ {in way to win the d5 knight if the king take back. If nont, i will have a very dangerous passed paw} Kxe6 {i'm getting happy ...} 22. e4 {e4 !} Qb6+ 23. Kh1 {wining time, but this is not a solution} Qf2 {i will take the knight anyway make a chess it will give the tempo to protect my king from mate} 24. exd5+ {d5 !} cxd5 25. Qc6+ {i have to be carefull i'm about to be mate ! ...} Kf7 26. Qxd5+ {i still can be mate at any moment ! ...} Kf6 {I would have liked to put my bishop on d4 or to put my tower on f1 (with protection of course) ! there must be a way to find something like this ! let's try } 27. Bg5+ {now the mate treat is over and i can chess the king with one more piece} Kg6 {I'm too hungry, I can no longer resist to this tasty rook ! } 28. Qxa8 Kxg5 29. Qxa5+ {as dessert} Kf6 30. Qc3+ {seaching to pin the white queen} Kf7 31. Qf3+ {this safety exchange will give me the victory with my a4 pawn protected by  the rook in a1. So Roquee resign. i had to disconnect because my boss was asking some work ... thanks for comments and advices}
