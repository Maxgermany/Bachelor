1. d4 {Here is a challenge from my friend hugomason, who in one of his chess books has discovered his new favourite opening: the Budapest Gambit. Hugo decided that trial-and-error was the best way to learn this opening, and so he challenged me to a game entitled "Budapest Gambit". I edited the title slightly for this annotation :-).} Nf6 2. c4 e5 {This is only the second time I have been faced with this unnatural-looking defence, the Budapest Gambit. Due to its tricky nature, it is often played at club level, but, since White is able to hold on to the two bishops and the extra pawn, it is rarely played at master level. White should accept the gambit.} 3. dxe5 Ng4 {Black's only continuation to put sufficient pressure on White's advanced extra pawn.} 4. Nf3 {4.Nf3 and 4.Bf4 are White's main options here: Black will have the advantage very quickly if White does not fight to hold onto his pawn. NOTE THAT 4.f4? is a bad move as with 4...Bc5! White's position is in trouble. I learned that the hard way in my first game vs the Budapest Gambit :-(...} Bc5 5. e3 Nc6 {I saw no good way of holding onto extra pawn, so I decided to let Black take it, but force him to waste developing moves while doing so.} 6. Be2 Qe7 {(?) Why doesn't Black just take the pawn?} 7. e6 Qxe6 8. Nc3 {Frantically trying to pull as far ahead as possible on development.} a6 {Playing for queenside expansion with ...b5. However, I can combat this very effectively with my own queenside expansion: 9.a3 b5 10.b4! and Black has expanded with tempo, giving his queenside pawns the edge. Of course, after this White's c4-pawn will be hanging, so I will need to do something about that...} 9. a3 b5 10. b4 Be7 11. c5 {I could see that this would weaken my pawn structure, and that Black could eliminate the over-enthusiastic c-pawn with ...d6, but this was the only way I saw that could save my c4-pawn without Black putting further pressure on it.} Bb7 12. O-O d6 13. Nd4 {(!) Discovering a threat on Black's g4-knight, with an attack on Black's queen. If 13...Nxd4 14.cxd4 and White shores up his queenside spatial gains.} Nxd4 14. exd4 h5 15. h3 Nh6 {? Loses the h-pawn.} 16. Bxh5 Qc4 {At this point, my imagination...well, it just ran wild. I suddenly saw a very neat and also crazy sacrificial attack which, I hoped, would lead to a checkmate. I saw that I could pin Black's e7-bishop, add more pressure, bring in both rooks...get a checkmate!!!!! My only reservation was that I did not particularly want to risk my rating with a speculative sacrificial attack against a lower-rated player. However, the adventurous part of my nature won.} 17. Re1 Qxc3 18. Bxh6 {Eliminating one defender from the area. I also considered 18.Bg5, as the f7-pawn is pinned, but I felt that the text was stronger.} Rxh6 {18...gxh6 19.cxd6 cxd6 20.Rc1!! Qxa3 21.Rc7!! wins for White, but with the text Black loses a lot more quickly.} 19. Qe2 Re6 {I almost quailed when I saw this irritating last-ditch defence, then I realised that the f7-pawn was pinned, so...} 20. Qxe6 {It always looks so much nicer when the neat checkmating attack comes from a person who is BEHIND on material...but frankly this really didn't bother me.} Qxe1+ 21. Rxe1 {Boring. I always hate it when my opponents waste time with pointless queen sacrifices to postpone the inevitable.} Kf8 22. Qxf7# {I think I can notch this up as a victory against the Budapest :-). Thanks for looking at this annotation!}
