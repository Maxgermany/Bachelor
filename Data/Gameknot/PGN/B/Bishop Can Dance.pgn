[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Team Match, I'm playing black. White opened with his Queen's pawn, so I reply Indian.} 2. Nc3 d5 {White took an interesting turn developing his knight to c3 before playing his pawn to c4. Black's reply moves us to a sort of Queen's Pawn Opening, though most of those opening lines usually recommend c4 before Nc3.} 3. Bf4 c5 {All right, if the queen's gambit is good for white, maybe it's good for black.} 4. Qd2 cxd4 {I am at a loss for finding this opening anywhere. I'm down to Queen's Pawn Game or Closed Game being my best options. So from here, I'm just winging it. White bumped his queen up to d2, let's make her move twice and commit herself to the center where I can pick on her a little.} 5. Qxd4 Nc6 6. Qa4 e6 {Since the LSB is going to d7 soon, no need to worry about blocking him in just yet, and I may have need of the DSB, so I open him up and prepare to castle if I wish. However, in light of the next few moves, I may have been better off with Nd7.} 7. Nb5 e5 {I panicked a bit here. White has a strong attack and my queenside seems full of holes. White's knight threatens the fork on c7, supported by his bishop. But he also blocks his queen's pin on the black knight at c6. I wanted to play 6. e5 instead of 6. e6, but with the knight pinned, e5 wasn't available. Now it is.} 8. Bxe5 Nxe5 {Evidently white wants to kill the black rook something fierce.} 9. Nc7+ Ke7 {It's double-check, nothing for it but to move the king and lose the rook. Well, lose the exchange because I will get that knight.} 10. Nxa8 Nc6 {Defending the pawn at a7. Moving the pawn with 10. ... a6? would be a mistake that would allow white's knight to escape.} 11. O-O-O Be6 {Defend the d5 pawn and prepare to kill that impertinent knight. White's choice to castle may have been a mistake. Instead, 11. Qb5 looked fairly strong, putting pressure on the pawn at b7 and making it very difficult for black to move his bishop off of c8. 11. ... b6 wouldn't help much - after 12. ... Be3, white could play 13. Nxb6 and gain two pawns for the loss of his knight, ending up way ahead in material.} 12. c4 Qxa8 {I pounce on that knight before white sees the opportunity I mentioned in my last note. Get it now while the getting is good. } 13. cxd5 Nxd5 {After all that, the material is about even, and white has developed a queen and rook and castled into a broken castle on an open file. Black has developed two knights and a bishop (and has developed his king, though maybe that's not yet a good thing).} 14. Qe4 Nf6 {White attacked the knight at d5, black brings it to safety.} 15. Qd3 Qc8 {Getting the queen out of the corner, and threatening to win the white queen with 16. ... Nb4 , 17. Qc3 (or lose the queen) Nxa2  and wins the queen anyway.} 16. Qc3 Bxa2 {White averted the threat. All seems safe, so let's gobble a pawn. } 17. Qa3+ Nb4+ {White forked the black king and the bishop on a2, but black had a move all prepared to handle that.} 18. Qc3 Qxc3+ {White is still tragically underdeveloped. Eliminating the royal ladies leaves black way ahead in development, and ahead in material, and with a strong attack against the paralyzed white kingside.} 19. bxc3 Nbd5 {Threaten the isolated pawn.} 20. Kb2 Ne4 {Threaten it again. White loses the exchange if he plays 21. Kxa2 Nd4xf3. But the knight on e4 is not just threatening one pawn - he's threatening two.} 21. Rd3 Nxf2 22. Kxa2 Nxd3 23. exd3 Nxc3+ {A little exchange sequence that wins a pawn for black. It also leaves an isolated white pawn on d3.} 24. Kb3 Nd1 25. Nh3 Ne3 26. g3 Nxf1 {Exchanging to exploit black's material lead.} 27. Rxf1 f6 {Hmmm, now white is the more developed. That's a switch. Time to fix it. First, keep the white knight out of my home.} 28. Nf4 Kf7 {Open the line for the bishop.} 29. d4 Bd6 30. Nd5 Re8 {Rook on an open file, planning to wreak havoc on the 7th.} 31. Nc3 b6 32. Nb5 Bb8 {The bishop and pawn were forked, only one move saves them both.} 33. d5 a6 34. Nc3 Re3 {Pins the knight.} 35. Kc4 Be5 36. Nd1 Re2 37. Rf2 Rxf2 {Removing white's strongest piece.} 38. Nxf2 a5 {And now it's smooth sailing with a relatively easy two-pawn-up endgame. The black bishop controls the promotion square for black's a-pawn, so that's the one I want to promote first.} 39. Ne4 Ke7 {Limits the mobility of the white knight.} 40. Kb5 Kd7 {At this point I worked out two possible endings: 41. Kxb6 a4 42. Nc5  Kd6 43. Nxa4 Kxd5 44. Kb5 Ke4 45. Nc5  Kf3 46. Ne6 g5 47. Nf8 h6 48. Nd7 Kg2 49. Nxe5 fxe5 50. Kc4 Kxh2 51. Kd3 Kxg3 52. Ke4 h5 53. Kxe5 h4 54. Kf5 g4 55. Ke4 h3 56. Ke3 h2 57. Ke2 h1=Q and also 41. Kxb6 a4 42. Nd2 a3 43. Nb3 a2 44. Kc5 a1=Q 45. Nxa1 Bxa1 46. h3 Be5 47. g4 g6 48. h4 f5 49. gxf5 gxf5 50. Kc4 f4 51. Kd3 Kd6 52. Ke4 h5 53. Kf3 Kxd5 54. Kf2 Ke4 55. Ke2 f3  56. Kf2 Bd4  57. Kg3 f2 58. Kg2 Kd3 59. Kf1 Kd2 60. Kg2 Ke2. These two endings both win for black, so I felt confident that all would be well.} 41. Kxb6 a4 {Now the pawn is ahead of the white king. Only the white knight can prevent promotion. White's next move is obvious.} 42. Nc5+ Kd6 43. Nxa4 Kxd5 {White just won two pawns for one, closing the gap in material, but the black king is in position to annihilate white's remaining pawns and there's not much white can do about it.} 44. Nc5 Bd4 {I have to give at least one ? to white's 44th move. 44. Nc5? was the worst thing white could do in this situation, as black's reply demonstrates. Now white loses his knight and the game. Maybe two question marks.} 45. Kc7 Bxc5 46. h3 Ke6 {Keep the white king away from the black pawns. If 47. Kd8 f5, 48. Ke8 Be7 traps the white king. Black is free to play a 3-on-2 pawn endgame, as long as he doesn't kill both white pawns and end in an immediate stalemate.} 47. Kc6 Bf2 {White tries a different way so black begins a little bishop dance to chase white's pawns into exchanges that favor black.} 48. g4 Be3 {Dancing. Whit's g-pawn cannot advance now. Black can now play 49. f5 and exchange one pair of pawns, isolating white's remaining pawn.} 49. h4 Bf2 {Dancing. } 50. h5 Be3 {Dancing more - that Bishop Can Dance! Now white cannot advance either pawn. Right where black wants them.} 51. Kc7 f5 52. gxf5+ Kxf5 {White was forced to exchange. And now he'll be forced again.} 53. Kd6 g6 54. hxg6 hxg6 {And now a simple endgame. White's king cannot possibly stop the pawn from promoting.} 55. Kd5 g5 56. Kc4 g4 57. Kd3 Kf4 {Save the bishop.} 58. Ke2 g3 59. Kf1 Kf3 {It's easy when the bishop covers the square on which the pawn will promote. The opposing king cannot claim the promotion square and hold out for a draw.} 60. Ke1 g2 61. Kd1 g1=Q+ 62. Kc2 Ke4 {White's had enough. This has been my longest game on GameKnot so far. In fact, it's 13 moves longer than my former longest. Well played by white.}
