1. c4 {Hey all; I'm taking a break from annotating these complex games, so here's a quick, lighter Blitz game to look at. Enjoy!} c6 {This is a less-popular response to the English; it's normally used to transpose to something else, like a Slav or Caro-Kann defense.} 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 {Everyone is looking at d5.} Nf6 4. d4 {White builds a strong center while Black prepares to make a pawn thrust to gain space of his own.} h5 {? Well, I didn't see this coming. Black would have been better off continuing with solid play, with perhaps 4...Bb4.} 5. e5 {White takes advantage of the weak d6 square.} Ng4 6. h3 Nxf2 {?! Rather unusual, but this is Blitz after all, so bold-looking sacrifices are the order of the day, sound or not.} 7. Kxf2 Be7 {There's really no way for this to accomplish anything.} 8. Nf3 h4 {Black sets up an outpost on the g3 hole.} 9. Be2 {This move is intended almost exclusively to provide a space for White's Rook on f1. White is now also in a position to threaten moves like Bh5.} Na6 {Black is having trouble coordinating his pieces thanks to his early pawn moves.} 10. Rf1 Nc5 {? Black has the idea of a tactic here to keep White from getting his King to g1, but with only two pieces developed (about to be only one!) he just doesn't have the firepower necessary to get compensation for this Knight, especially since he sacrificed one piece for no compensation already!} 11. dxc5 Bxc5+ 12. Be3 Qb6 13. Qd2 {Black piles up on the Be3; White defends it. White now has his Rooks connected and a fully developed army, whereas Black has... a Queen and Bishop, and chances for one Rook on the opposite flank several moves down the road.} Bxe3+ 14. Qxe3 Qxb2 {Black wins back a pawn, but he is so far behind now that in a standard game he should surrender immediately. This is blitz though, so errors are much more likely.} 15. Rab1 Qa3 16. Rb3 {White lifts his Rook with tempo, in preparation for doubling on the b or f file.} Qe7 {White's pieces have all the energy and scope. Black's have almost none at all.} 17. Kg1 a5 {? Accomplishes nothing.} 18. a4 d5 19. cxd5 exd5 {Black has finally given his LSB somewhere to go.} 20. Ng5 {White supports e6 and unleashes his Rook on the f-file.} f6 {Black kicks the Knight.} 21. Nxd5 {!? White gives back some material in exchange for pressing the attack.} cxd5 22. Bb5+ {This is the point of 21.Nxd5. Black's only choice is 22...Kf8, walking into the pin. Other options fail: 22...Bd7 23.Bxd7+ Qxd7 24.exf6+ etc., or 22...Kd8 23.Qb6+ Qc7 24.Nf7+ Ke7 25.Qxc7+.} Kf8 23. Qd4 {White threatens Qxd5 or exf6.} f5 {Black hits the Knight in response.} 24. Ra3 {?? My finger slipped!} Qxa3 25. e6 {Setting the Queen on g7 and cutting off the defense of f5.} Ke7 {?? 25...Qe7 was necessary.} 26. Qxg7+ {Regaining the Rook.} Kd6 27. Qxh8 Qg3 {? The last mistake.} 28. Qd8+ Ke5 29. Nf3+ Ke4 30. e7 {The pawn cannot be stopped. There was probably a quicker forced mate, but I wasn't going to try to find it under time pressure.} Rb8 31. e8=Q+ Be6 32. Qxe6+ Kf4 33. Qe5# {That's it! Thanks to my opponent for a spirited fight, and thanks to anyone reading this for reading!}
