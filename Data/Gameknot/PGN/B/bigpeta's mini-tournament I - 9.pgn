1. c4 c5 { } 2. Nf3 {standard opening} Nf6 3. Nc3 {Pretty much the standard line here.} Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. g3 {I ummed and ahhhed about NxN but in the end opted for developing my major pieces  so g3 making room for Bg2} Qb6 7. e3 {Nxc6 wasn't an option as his queen would end up on c6 compromising my Rook on h1} Bb4 8. Bd2 {Candidate moves were Ne3 or Bd2 so Bd2 developed the game } Nxd4 9. exd4 {Not much option here} Qxd4 10. Qe2 {The Q needs to get into the action. I suspect Pete move his N into the attack next.} d5 11. O-O-O {It seems the expedient thing to move the King from the Q's line of fire and put the rook in its place.....Pete has advised this was a mistake!} Qxc4 12. Qxc4 {Well I figure a Q swap is my best option here....} dxc4 13. Nb5 Bxd2+ 14. Rxd2 {The decision was which to take with ...King or Rook?   I decided not to block the rook in and it also gives me a line on an open file.} Ke7 15. Bxc4 Bd7 16. Nc3 {I don't want to do an exchange which would leave Pete with a N and me with a B in the end game. Nc3 to give me time to move the king who is vulnerable on c file} Rac8 17. Bd3 {Pete's going to attack with Nd5 now.....} Nd5 18. Rc2 {If Nxc3 then Rxc3 I'm on the defensive here...not good.} Nb4 19. Rd2 {this is a sad sad game now!  If I didn't move my Rook it was lost and now my K is pinned by the N. I had thought of Nd5+ but would have ended up losing my N for nothing} Nxa2+ 20. Kb1 {I'm going to lose the pawn after NxN b2xN Rxc3} Nxc3+ 21. bxc3 Rxc3 22. Kb2 {I figure that I need to get my king out of the corner and off the white squares ....thought about Rd2 or Rc1. } Rc5 23. Rc2 {a new day a new perspective.  I needed to get the B and Rook off the same file ....offering again a Rook swap.} Rxc2+ 24. Bxc2 a5 25. Rc1 {Want to get the rook out and on an open file  also get a barrier his king can't move over as all the action I suspect will initially be on the Queen side of the board.} b5 26. Bd3 {I needed to get the B and R off the same file. If he moves Rc8 then RxR BxR and Bxb5.} Rb8 {As all the action is on the Queen side every plan I had could be countered easily by Pete so it was a no win situation (3 pawns down) so resigned at this stage as believed I wouldn't learn anything more by going through the pain.....of checkmate!}
