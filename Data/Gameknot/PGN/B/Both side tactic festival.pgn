1. d4 {Never set a conditional move in a complex position...} d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bf4 {The London (or something like that), a scheme I love, that foresee (if allowed) strong kingside attack, queenside castling, c3 (instead of c4), and Ne5, g4, h4... while the lsb is trapped for black. } c5 4. e3 {This is a mistake, actually, since should black move Qb6, white has problems defending b2. } a6 {My bishop never had the intention to go to b5. It will move the last, since I am looking for queenside castling. But this move sets the possibility of a queenside black pawn storm, so I play...} 5. a4 {This pawn isn't aware of the GREAT task it will play on the game. Without it, I would have been lost. } Nf6 6. Nbd2 {Pursuing c3, the queenside safeguard.} Nc6 7. c3 {White's scheme is almost complete. Normally, by pushing g and h pawns white has a good attack here. But it won't be so easy this time...} Bd7 8. Ne5 {Normally, I delay this move until black plays the bishop, but since he is delaying it...} cxd4 9. exd4 Rc8 {Black is playing very good, building pressure on the queenside, while my attack on the kingside is still far.} 10. Bd3 {I consider this move a loss of time. I have to push my pawns instead. This bishop will came out when it is a real danger for black. Of course, white has to take care about Qb6, since the normal defence, Qc2, is now impossible due to Nxd4.} Be7 11. g4 {I decided that if I don't attack very quickly, black can get the game even...} Qb6 12. b3 {Sad necessity....} Nb8 {I expected Na5... but not everybody is aggressive like me...} 13. g5 {I am aggressive, no doubt...} Ne4 {This move loses a central pawn for black. Of course, I will lose the important c one. Still, the natural c4 is met by Qxd4, I didn't want it. The game is quickly developing into a "black attacks the queenside and white the kingside", one of those nice situations in which is very hard to see who would be quicker. I saw it, and decided to play the exchanges. I couldn't imagine how complex will turn out to be the situation in few moves...} 14. Nxe4 dxe4 15. Bxe4 Rxc3 {Of course, the queenside castling will be impossible. } 16. Qh5 {I would say this move is sort of "naive"... But I am not the one who plays the passive Rb1.  Still, I had the nice Nc4, forcing the queen to a7 (or d8), maybe better for me. This was a conditional move I set before...  But later, I saw that the simple 16. Nxf7 would have been enough to win here! Do you agree?} g6 {As expected. It seems to be a refutation, but...} 17. Nxg6 {yes, his sad b8 knight is hanging. } fxg6 18. Bxg6+ {and now I have the time to take back the knight, having destroyed his king's position. Of course, my own king is naked, too... Wait, this is not all.} Kd8 {Probably, the best move is Be5, threatening his rook AND defending the important d pawn. If Rf8, Bg7... but I didn't dare to leave the knight. It is a mistake, actually.  } 19. Bxb8 {2 pawns is not a bad score. But my white bishop has not easy square to retire, and my d4 pawn is en prise. More than that, my king is exposed to the pieces that can go to the black diagonal. Only my pawn in a4 keeps me to be really, really bad...} Rxb3 {The other choice for black was Qxd4, that I feared, but I had Rd1, or Bb4 (but I o-o)...  With this move, Black intends to accelerate the checks on the black diagonas.  Still, when I looked at this position, I had the feeling that I will be winning.  After looking carefully at it, I realized it is in fact almost lost for white...  I had the good threat Rc1 (Bc7+ and then the discovered check that would have made me win material, but this is not true! Look...   20.	Rc1, 		Bb4+ 21.	Kf1, 		Qxd4 22.	Bc7+, 	Ke7 23.	Bxh7,		Rb2 24.	Bf4, 		Bc6 25.	g5-g6, 	Rb1+ 26.	Rxb1, 	Qxb1+ 27.	Ke2, 		Bxh1 28.	g6-g7, 	Qe1+ 29.	Kd3, 		Rd8+ 30.	Kc2, 		Rd2+ 31.	Kb3, 		Qb1+ 32.	Kc4, 		Bd5+ 33.	Qxd5, 	Bxd5#  ...as an example only. } 20. O-O {After carefully considering Be5 and Rc1, I saw the checks on my king would have been too dangerous for me... since my queen will be called in defence of my king, while my white square bishop is still hanging! I admit this situation was far too complicated to be fully analyzed. Too many hidden threats... observe that my white h1 diagonal is wide open... wow! Black taking d4 allows me to Rd1, with more threats and a nice pin over the lsb.} Qxd4 {yeah, yeah... the good (for me) side of this move is that it opens the column where the black king is... but how to go on? Black apparently cannot take the a4 pawn with the bishop, due to the pin to the queen. But he can hide with the rook, but for my bishop. So, the safer move would have been something like Bc2... that looks ugly! I analyzed all the variants I could after Bf7, and the only good move for black will be Bc5. Against this, I have g6! Any other move for black leads to material loss... but I must play very carefully, since a single mistake will lead black to threat mate on the white diagonal... combinations fluorished by both sides, and it was really difficult to find a "sure" move! Note that if my queen gets far from g4, black will mate me!} 21. Bf7 {Maybe a blunder but... } Qg7 22. Rfd1 {Another plan was Re1, then Ra-d1... } Bxg5 {Black adds pressure and mate threats... more and more interesting.  Some variants I looked at:  23.	Rxd7+, 	Kc8 24.	Bxe6, 	Be7+ 25.	Bg3, 		Qxa1+ 26.	Kg2, 		Qf6 27.	Re7+, 	Kd8 28.	Qd1+, 	Ke7 29.	Qd7+, 	Kf8 30.	Bd6+, 	Qe7 31.	Qe7#	  or: 23.	Bxe6, 	Bf6+ 24.	Bg3, 		Bd4 25.	Qh4+, 	Bf6 26.	Rxd7+, 	Qxd7 27.	Qf6+, 	Qe7 28.	Qxh8+, 	Qe8 29.	Qe8+, 	Ke8 30.	Bxb3	  or: 23.	Bxe6, 	Kc8 24.	Be5, 		Bf6+ 25.	Bg3, 		Bxa1 26.	Bxd7+, 	Kd8 27.	Bg4+, 	Ke7 28.	Rd7+, 	Kf8 29.	Qc5+, 	Kg8 30.	Be6+, 	Qf7 31.	Bxf7+, 	Kg7 32.	Qg5+, 	Kf8 33.	Bd6#	  and a big "etcetera".... :-)} 23. Bxe6 {Letting him play the discovered check! I analyzed different outomes, and I was really wondering where will the bishop go.  Bf4+ is interesting (recovering the bishop, or losing it) Be3+ is also interesting, trying to play Bxf2, and even  Bc1+ is interesting, since then black can take the a1 rook with the queen!} Bd2+ {Ok, let's see:   Choices for white are:  a) Bg3 b) Kf1 c) Kh1 d) Bg4 e) Qg4  a) 24. Bg3 looks good.   The first answer to  be considered is a1) 24. ..., Bxe6. This is good for me because it follows:       25. Rxd2+, and black has 3 moves:   1+) 25. ..., Bd7, that is no good for black for      26. Qe5, and black ends loosing the bishop 2++) 25. ..., Kc8      26. Qc5+, and I win, or 3+) 25. ..., Ke7, that doesn't make me win inmediately, but I keep good tactic resources.   The second answer for black is 2+) 24. ..., Rd3. White can play  25. Qh4+, that seems to provide good tactics for white, even after 25. ..., Bg5 26. Qxg5, QxQ 26. RxR, Qg7 27. Rxbd7+, QxR 28. BxQ, KxB and white is up a piece.  or:  25. Bc4, Bg4,  26. Qh4+ and white ends with more material.  Black doesn't seem to have other answer, so Bg3 is a good move here, providing equality at least, unless black fails somewhere.   b) 24. Kf1 It mantains free the dsb.   If black takes the bishop 24. ..., Bxe6,  25. Rxd2+ Black has several answers here, with more or less the same as in the previous analysis, but with two differences.  The first is that black has to cope with the threat Be5, that pins the queen. The second is that blacks has the threat Bc4+, Ke1, Qg1#.  If black covers the king with 24. ..., Bd7, he loses his threat. Whte doesn't have the chance 25. Rxd7+, Qxd7, 26. Rd1 because of Rd3. White can answer 27. Qh4+, but black has two answers:  1+) 27. ..., Ke8, that looses material after 28. Re1+, Kf7,  29. Qf4+, Kg6,  30. Qe4+, Kf7 31. Qc4+, Kf8 (Kg6 looses after Re6+) 32. Qf4+, Kg8 33. Be4, where the black rook is trapped, even if black plays Qh3+, 34. Kg1.  2-) 27. ..., Kc8 28. Qc4+, Qc6 29. QxR, KxB and material is even! (No use for black to play Qh1+, 30. Ke2, Re8+, 31. Kd2, QxR+, 32. KxQ, 33. Re8, 34. QxR+, KxQ and white has a free bishop!)  After 27. Qa5+, Kc8, 28. Rc1+, KxB, 29. Qe4+, Ka7, 30. QxR(h8), etc, material is even again.   So, 26. Rxd7+ leads only to even result.  But white can play directly 27. Be5, pinning the black queen. I cannot see any good move for black, but to loose a quality.  Better is for black not to cover the king, and again we have 2 moves:   1-) 25. ..., Kc8, that keeps the mate threat over white. white has to care about his rook on a1, too, so he must play 27. Qc5+, KxB, and white has nothing, since 28. Ra1-d1, leads to be mated starting with Bh+.  No need to analyze Kf8, since it is not difficult for black to find Kc8.   So 25. Rxd7+ doesn't seem to be a good way to progress for white.   Now, what happens if white plays 25. Qa5+ instead? Nothing.  And what if white plays 25. Qc4? Black gets the hand with Bh3+.  So no b) Kf1.   c) 24. Kh1 has the disadvantage of Bc6+. My God, even 25. f3 seems to be possible. Bxf3,  26. Qxf3, Rxf3, 27. Rxd2+, if Ke7,  28. Rd7+, and it is better for black to play KxB, that leads to equality (29. RxQ, RxB) than  Kf6 (29. RxQ, KxR, 30. Be5+, Rf6, 31. Rg1+, winning the rook).  But let's see 25. Bd5. It's hard to find a} 24. Kh1 Bc6+ 25. Bd5 {My saving board... I cannot take the rook, and I cannot take the bishop... funny, isn't it?} Kc8 {Freeing himself from the potential pin/check.  Note that Be5 is not possible for me anymore, because of BxB+. But still so, f3 (Bxf3, QxB, RxQ, BxQ is to be considered.} 26. Bg3 Rxg3 {Was it really necessary for black?} 27. fxg3 {If f2xg3, with Qh6 black releases his position. } Rd8 {The spectre of this move stayed over me all the time. } 28. Bxc6 {Norhing better. It seems that black has coped with the storm and the game will be decided in the endgame. } bxc6 {Relax? Not yet.} 29. Qf5+ {The tension is partially released. I couldn't make much of all the hard work...} Kc7 30. Rdf1 {I decided I won't succeed in threating the bishop. } Rd7 31. Rab1 {Releasing queen's threat over a1.} Qd4 {Note I am only a careless move from mate. Despite my material advantage. After all.} 32. Qf2 {Black cannot take a4 because of Qa6+ and wins. } Be3 {Foreseen. } 33. Qc2 {The white queen guards g2.} h5 {We are in a kind of stalled position, with mate threats on both sides. But now black loses a pawn. } 34. Qf5 Rd5 35. Qf7+ Rd7 36. Qxh5 {And black cannot take the a4 pawn due to Qe5+, while Qe4+ is saved by Qf3.} Qe4+ 37. Qf3 Qxf3+ {At last, the endgame. } 38. Rxf3 {Definitely ending with the tactic moment. I am a quality and a pawn up, with 2 passed and joined pawns. A win. } Bd4 39. h4 {Another possibility was Rd3, but this just allowed c5 with a slight uneasiness for black. } c5 40. Kg2 {Just in case. The game is not finished yet.} Re7 41. g4 {tempting black to try tricks based on his bishop and the position of my king...} Re2+ {...which he does.} 42. Kh3 Be5 {Black is trying a checkmate, so he is not trying to recover the quality by pushing his pawn... but I know he must hold his pieces.} 43. g5 Kc6 {I thoght about a5, but this will make my pawn vulnerable to his bishop and rook... anyway. } 44. h5 {Trusting on f5 as the escape square of my king. I am not very trained into finals, so I thought that the nearer to the 8º row my pawns, more chances I had to finish the game soon. } Kd5 {...but maybe I should have prevented his king to cross this line. Now I have to start thinking again... uff!!!! ;-)))} 45. g6 Ke4 {When faced with this, I thought that my rook can either escape to f7 or be supported by the other one. But I thought this will have granted him a draw, after Rh2+, Kg3, Rg2+, Kh4 (trying to reach the safe square h6), Rh2+, Kg5, Bf4+. Of course, I had Rh3, but I didn't see it.  You see, after all the thinking, I was really tired of this game, and with almost no time to think about it.  As usual in this kind of position, sacrifying the quality is a sure way to win. So I played...} 46. Rbb3 {...thinking that if c4, Ra3, c3, Rxc3, BxR, RxB and nothing will stop my pawns! By this move, I had accepted that my move Rh3 would have protected me against any trick involving trapping my king. } Bg7 {Probably a definitive mistake, since it gives me the necessary tempo to bring my rook to f7 safely. } 47. Rf7 {You see, Re3+ make him lose. RxR+, KxR, RxB and nobody can prevent my rook to take the c pawn then crown mine. } Be5 {47.	f3-f7, 	g7-e5 48.	f7-e7, 	e2-h2+ 49.	h3-g4	, h2-g2+ 50.	g4-h4	, g2-h2+ 51.	b3-h3	, h2-h3+ 52.	h4-h3	, e4-f5 53.	e7-e5+, 	f5-f6 54.	e5-c5	, f6-g7 55.	h3-g4	, g7-h6 56.	c5-c7	, a6-a5 57.	c7-h7#	  7.	f3-f7, 	g7-e5 48.	f7-e7, 	e2-h2+ 49.	h3-g4	, h2-g2+ 50.	g4-h4	, g2-h2+ 51.	h4-g4	, c5-c4 52.	e7-e5+, 	e4-e5 53.	b3-c3	, e5-d4 54.	g6-g7	, h2-g2+ 55.	c3-g3	, c4-c3 56.	g7-g8	, c3-c2 57.	g3-g2	, c2-c1 58.	g8-d8+, 	d4-e3 59.	g2-g3+, 	e3-e4 60.	d8-d3+, 	e4-e5 61.	g3-e3+, 	e5-f6 62.	d3-f5+, 	f6-g7 63.	e3-e7+, 	g7-g8 64.	f5-h7+, 	g8-f8 65.	h7-f7#	  47.	f3-f7, 	g7-e5 48.	f7-e7, 	e4-f5 49.	b3-f3+, 	f5-g5 50.	f3-g3+, 	e5-g3 51.	e7-e2	, g5-f6 52.	h3-g3	, } 48.
