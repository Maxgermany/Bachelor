1. d4 {Queen's Gambit} d5 2. c4 {Of course main line is to not capture pawn} e6 {good defence, but c6 for Koro-Kahn Defence is just as solid} 3. a3 {This is to prevent Bb4, which is a very annoying move} Nf6 4. Nc3 {Knight is now safe and able to hold its square on c3} c5 {This move I do not know how to respond to, in real life Black always plays Bd6 and c5 with my pawn and there is no problem. I don't mind this move, because it's like the Gambit I played} 5. Bg5 {The Knight is backing up his center, so I decide to put some more pressure on it} Nbd7 {Defending just in case} 6. e3 {Finally the ideal situation for me} h6 {I really don't like this move, but since I don't know which side he will castle my Bishop will continue to pin the knight, or control the center} 7. Bf4 {I decided that the center needed some more control} g5 {Now I know if he castles King Side the pawns are vulnerable} 8. Bg3 {Usually h4 and King's side castle become really dangerous} Bg7 {Putting more defence for a castle but pawns are main defence and they are moved too far out} 9. Bd3 {Planning to put more pressure to force him to castle Queen, but he does so anyways} O-O {Now Queen c2 for a battery in the near future} 10. Nf3 {Bringing another attacker into the King side} g4 {Moving the pawns even farther? I just easily avoided this and also moving my Knight closer to the Black King} 11. Ne5 {I wanted a trade so the pieces are cleared. I have so many more attackers in this position} Qb6 {I saw the potential of his attack so I decided the only thing I could do was counter attack} 12. Qc2 Nh5 {Again forcing my pieces into better positions. This is just plain suicide} 13. Bh4 {I didn't know about this move, but I didn't want to trade because my Bishop is vital to my attack} f6 {Again, too far out with his pawns, I just magnificently beat him now} 14. Ng6 {Ne7 is unpleasant, because then the rest of my attackers will rush in} Re8 {Preventing my good move} 15. cxd5 {First nail in coffin. I wanted to clear some pieces so my attack could become more deadly} exd5 {I wanted to castle but my pieces were just begging to get in the fight} 16. Nxd5 {Beautiful attack on Queen and because of this all his pieces need to relocate} Qe6 17. Nc7 {Muhahaha Ultra fork} Qc6 {Attacks my Knight, but the Queen has been deceived and Mate in 3} 18. Bc4+ {Mate in 2, unless he gives up rook and queen} Kh7 19. Nf8+ {Double check, so mate in 1. See it?} Kh8 20. Qh7# {Time to die}
