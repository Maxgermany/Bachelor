1. Nf3 {First of two MT games vs zed2.  } c5 2. c4 {transposes into a symmetrical English.} g6 3. d4 Bg7 4. e4 {opening databases show decent success creating space and grabbing the center like this.  } cxd4 {similar to my recent game vs ionadowman, ...black investigates the real estate at d4.} 5. Nxd4 e5 {creating an outpost at d4 but blocking the dsb.} 6. Nb5 {horse goes for a walk.} Bf8 {protects lsb, preserves castling, and gives dsb some running room (well sort of).  but also represents two moves that could have been better invested.} 7. Be3 Nc6 8. Be2 a6 {pushes knight...} 9. Nd6+ {...to d6} Bxd6 {BxN} 10. Qxd6 {QxB} Qf6 {and black initiates a queen exchange.} 11. Bc5 {better to let black capture.  bishop could prove useful, if obnoxious, on d6.  prevents recapture with development by knight.} Qxd6 12. Bxd6 {it will not be easy to move the B off d6} Nge7 {hmm, interfering with white's interference of black's castling.  } 13. Nc3 {clearing off home rank and bringing the knight into the game.} f6 {frees up knights.  but the pawn may come to need protection.  perhaps better to have castled.} 14. O-O h5 {now two pawns not protected by pawns, potential targets.  if the pawn advance continues, perhaps white will have to address the threat.  in the meantime, will work fast to avoid any such issues.} 15. Rfd1 Nd4 {black takes up residence on the previously scouted d4.  quite a few place white can not go.  with this move, black also brings some pressure on herself.  if black castles and white plays Nd5, the N on e7 would be pinned and attacked twice. a nice ongoing threat by white's remaining knight.} 16. Bf1 {conserving the bishop, perhaps to move it to c4 a little further along.  those two diagonals, a3-f8 and a2-g8, look potentially useful for white.} Kf7 {frees the knight but leaves the R on its home square.} 17. Rac1 {prevents the knight from getting to e3 in two moves (forking R & B), ...freeing the f pawn, who might want to move to f4, and keeping the B in the game.} Ke6 {black king looking for trouble.} 18. c5 {two moves prevent checkmate.  obviously, white would like a third move such as 18. ...Re8 which leads to the interesting 19. Bc4+ Nd5, 20. Bxd5#.  Instead...} Kf7 {...black backs out. as with the bishop earlier in the game, two moves not invested in offense or in improving overall position.  Black could also have played 18. ...b5.  white could not then play the en passant capture without losing the bishop and also could not move the B to c4.  PLUS, black's bishop could get into the game.  Probably the better move.  Or would white be able to fight his way on to c4 and land the previously mentioned checkmate? Comments?} 19. Bc4+ {the coveted square.  f4 still interesting but would have allowed the K to move to the flank (after ...Nc6).  this move obliges the king to protect the knight.} Ke8 20. f4 {20. f4 prompts...} Nec6 {20. ...Nec6 adding protection to e5 and d4, BUT preventing ...Rf8.} 21. Nd5 {21. Nd5, creating a very crowded center and forking c7 & f6.  black resigns.  Thank you to zed2 for the good game.}
