1. e4 e6 2. Bc4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. Bb3 Nf6 5. h3 {Seems a little bit slow, but, alas! I am no one to take advantage of slow movements!} Bd6 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O Bf5 {Not sure if positioning this B here is good enough, since, after next movements, it can be taken by N, or at least threaten. but if  Nxbg6 (after several movement) opening the f column doesn´t look bad.} 8. d3 c6 {Maybe not the most aggressive, but I wanted to focus on the white´s king while having a solid pawn defense  on the other side.} 9. Nc3 Nbd7 10. a3 Qc7 11. Ne2 {Re1 seems more active, or moving the c1 Bishop. Again, this is a blitz game, and we always try new things here, riskier.} Rfe8 {Maybe 11...Rae8 !? Now 12.Nh4 doesn´t seem that bad, although still B in c1 needs to be positioned in a better place} 12. c3 Re6 {Too fast, too furious; better Re7. But I was thinking about taking the 6 line (one of these days). It was not a calculated move.} 13. Ned4 {Punishment comes fast. Thought about giving up.} Bg6 {What the hell...it is a blitz game and there is still some attack left.} 14. Nxe6 fxe6 15. Ng5 e5 {How about 15...Nc5!?} 16. Nf3 {Giving time to black to arm a better attack} Rf8 17. Nh4 Bh5 18. f3 Nc5 {B in b3 is a pain on my king. But then if 19.Bc2, it gives white another strong position for that bishop.} 19. Ba2 {Surprise. but maybe not that bad. I was thinking about moving my king away to eliminate that bishop´s activity.} e4 {...and yet the Queen in d1 seems to help my attack. No time to waste, no get away for the king.} 20. g4 Bh2+ {!?} 21. Kh1 Qg3 {Too much attack, and, again, only a few mins/secs to calculate the best defense.} 22. Qe2 {Good one! 22.gxh5; Qxh3!  Now that bishop in c1 blocking the R in a1 is quite an advantage for black.} Qxh4 23. Qxh2 {Now the Queen has a strong defensive position. If column f is opened, and eventually there is Rxf8+, then queen has d6 or b8 to attack and, at least, find an easy draw position. Not sure what is best for black now. Both white and black have only secs left (around 1 min each and dropping)} Nxd3 {Anny suggestions? Of course, gxh5 helps black attack a lot, thus 23...Nxd3 helps sutaining the attack. I was thinking about moving Bg6 asap} 24. fxe4 {This, as noted before, is a real pain, since N in f6 cannot be moved whithout causing the rook exchange and the Queen activity within black´s defensive lines.} Bg6 {Spent a lot of time here thinking about Bg4. Didn´t see anything convincing. Now I am under 20 secs left.} 25. exd5 cxd5 {That painful B in a2... This was the best I could come off in these circumstances.} 26. Be3 h5 {Leaves the king an escape route...but also weakens the column} 27. Bf2 Nxf2+ 28. Rxf2 hxg4 29. hxg4 {And now what...? Less than 15-20 secs left on my clock. didn´t see a clear prospect for draw if 29...Be4+, 30...Qxh2 and  31...Ng4, since those towers seem a real pain against my castling and d5 seems weak enough to be lost later on.} Be4+ 30. Kg1 Qxg4+ {So I felt I needed to keep the queen, if I still want to go for a lucky win.} 31. Kf1 {...and found that the king has a long walk around his lines...Can I get something out of it?} Bd3+ 32. Ke1 Re8+ {Activating my rook and avoiding changing it for white´s.} 33. Kd2 {Now, less than 10 secs... What to do?} Bh7 {I had the feeling I needed to back my bishop, but not sure where. It seems Bg6 might be better choice} 34. Rxf6 {!! Nice one! Threats Rg1 if gxf6.  10 secs for black... nothing to do? This is the end of the game, but after 20-30 more secs I saw: 34...Qe4!  This is why I wanted to share this game. I found it interesting and fun. Intention of checkmate in c2, and checks in e3 with strong attack. Also now gxf6 can be done. Hope you enjoyed it!}
