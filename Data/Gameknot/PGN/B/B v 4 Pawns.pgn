1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It has been a while since I have annotated a game.  I have been writing up some memoirs of my friendship with a lady called Rita who died of breast cancer last year.  I am now putting the finishing touches on the memoirs so hopefully I will be able to. a. Get some closure from the death, although I will never forget about her, b. Move faster, c. annotate more games.  Anyhow, here I am, up against an IM called Hexs (Hector).  After 1. e4, he responded with e6 which is the French Defense.  Gameknot analysis is provided here:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16540036&rnd=0.7359081799218419.  Just 3 innaccuracies from myself proved decisive.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {3. ...... exd5 - pawn trade - this is called the Exchange Variation of the French Defense.  Hopefully I will be able to give my IM opponent some run for his money with this variation, even get something other than a big fat zero out of it ...... maybe .....} 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3 - development and pressure on d5.} Bb4 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nf3 Re8+ 8. Be3 {8. Be3 - I decided to block the check with Be3 to give myself the option of tucking Henry away on the kingside.} Nc6 9. O-O Bg4 {9. ..... Bg4 - pin.} 10. a3 Bxc3 11. bxc3 dxc4 12. Bxc4 {12. Bxc4 - we have a series of exchanges and so far my position still looks OK.  Looks can be deceptive however.} Qd6 13. Be2 {13. Be2 - pin-breaker.} h6 14. Qb3 {14. Qb3 - now Glenda hits at b7.} Nd5 15. c4 Na5 {15. ...... Na5 ..... only for her to be harassed by Hector's knight on a5.} 16. Qd3 Nxe3 17. fxe3 {17. fxe3 - the backward e3 pawn is soon gonna be a target.  Next move the Wicked Witch of the West will hone in on it.} Qe7 18. Kf2 {18. Kf2 - the only piece that can defend this weak pawn is Henry.  I am gonna have to uncastle him as you will see over the next few moves.} c5 19. d5 Nxc4 {19. ..... Nxc4! - this move spectacularly sacrifices a piece to bust up my pawn structure so that the Wicked Witch of the West can blast it to dust.} 20. Qxc4 Qxe3+ 21. Ke1 b5 22. Qc2 {22. Qc2 - only move to avoid the loss of Fou Leblanc and more importantly, for Henry to avoid copping Old Matey on e2.} Bxf3 23. gxf3 Rad8 {23. ....... Rad8 - the vulnerable pawn on d5 is now about to drop and so is my pawn on a3.} 24. Rd1 Qxa3 25. Rf2 c4 {25. ...... c4 - already there is a menacing black queenside pawn roll.} 26. Kf1 {26. Kf1 - unpin.} Re5 27. d6 Rxd6 28. Rxd6 Qxd6 29. Qa2 c3 {29. ....... c3 - I decided not to take the pawn on a7 thinking that it might allow the c pawn to crown.  After I put Glenda on c2 I said to Hector in the Chat that the a7 pawn reeked of arsenic, particularly if a strong IM like him leaves it en prise.  Hector told me that I was certainly wise not to take it.} 30. Qc2 Qc5 31. Bd3 a5 32. Re2 {32. Re2 - if my opponent moves his rook off the e file then my own rook can come down to e8 with check and suddenly it will look nasty for Hector's king.  But he trades rooks.} Rxe2 33. Qxe2 {33. Qxe2 - Glenda is still eyeing up that e8 square, threatening to come down on it with check and menace the black kingside pawns, possibly even the queenside pawns should the Wicked Witch of the West block her check on e8.  But Hector has other ideas, he decided to give his king some luft with 33. ...... g6.} g6 34. Qc2 a4 35. Bxg6 {35. Bxg6 - a desperate sac. to wipe out the black kingside pawns and try and get a perpetual.} fxg6 36. Qxg6+ Kf8 37. Qxh6+ Ke7 38. Qg7+ Kd8 {38. ...... Kd8 - but Hector's king is gonna run for cover.} 39. Qf6+ Kc7 40. Qf4+ Kb6 41. Qb8+ Ka5 {41. ..... Ka5 - which he eventually finds.} 42. Qa8+ Kb4 43. Qh8 a3 {43. ...... a3 - here I decided to wave the white flag as there was no way I could contain the queenside pawns and stop one of them from crowning.  4 pawns are definitely better than a bishop.  Anyhow at least this imbalance made the game interesting, even though I lost.  Hope you have all enjoyed your weekend - bye for now - Joanne}
