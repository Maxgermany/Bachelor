1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 {Normal.} Nbd7 5. Nf3 Be7 6. e3 c6 7. Bd3 {Still normal.} Qc7 8. O-O Bd6 9. Bxf6 Nxf6 {I might have considered taking with the g pawn, as that would give him the g file to play with.} 10. Qc2 Ng4 {Adds a third attacker to h2. I'm starting to feel a little pressure.} 11. g3 h5 12. Rfe1 h4 {? I suppose he didn't notice I could capture with my knight. If I couldn't have taken with my knight this would have been very strong.} 13. Nxh4 Be7 14. Nf3 e5 {His attack has now fizzled out, while he h file is half open he doesn't have any good way to get his queen over to it.} 15. dxe5 Nxe5 16. Nxe5 Qxe5 17. f4 Qh5 18. h4 Qg4 {Bxh4 looked like a tempting sac, but I don't think it would have accomplished much.} 19. Qg2 Bxh4 {Now he plays it, and although he does get a bit of an attack, it doesn't really work because I can just trade queens.} 20. gxh4 Rxh4 {?? He really needed to take with his queen as that might have left him with a bit of an attack, this lets my exchange out of it.} 21. Qxg4 Bxg4 22. Be2 f5 23. Bxg4 Rxg4+ 24. Kf2 O-O-O 25. cxd5 cxd5 26. Rad1 Rh8 27. Nxd5 {Up be three, but he begins his third and last attack now.} Rh2+ 28. Kf3 Rgh4 {Threatens mate, but I have a neat way to deal with it and win a pawn at the same time.} 29. Ne7+ {!} Kc7 30. Nxf5 {Stops the mate.} Rh4h7 31. Rdc1+ Kb6 32. Red1 Rh7h3+ 33. Ke4 g6 34. Rd6+ {Now I begin my first and only attack.} Kb5 35. Nd4+ Kb4 36. a3+ Ka5 37. Rc5+ Ka4 38. Rc4+ {If I didn't play this attack accurately, I would appreciate comments showing me how I went wrong.} Ka5 39. Nb3+ Kb5 40. Kd4 {Quiet move.} Rxb2 41. Rd5+ Kb6 42. Rb4+ Kc6 {?? Ka6 would allow mate, this allows me to win his rook. Kc7 might have held on a little longer but he was really doomed.} 43. Na5+ {And he resigns. Please comment and rate.}
