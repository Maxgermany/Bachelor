1. e4 g5 2. d4 h6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Bc4 d6 5. Be3 Nc6 6. Nge2 Nf6 7. Ng3 e6 8. O-O O-O {All the games start from this position.} 9. Nh5 Nxh5 10. Qxh5 Qf6 {I bring over the Q to support the K-side. If I can succeed in exchanging Q's, I can cut down White's attacking potential considerably.} 11. d5 exd5 12. Bxd5 Be6 {Naturally I would like to get rid of White's powerful B.} 13. a3 Bxd5 14. Nxd5 Qxb2 15. Nxc7 Rac8 {The B's are off the board, and a pair of Pawns fall as well.} 16. Nd5 Qxc2 17. Rac1 Qxe4 18. Nc3 Qg6 {Having won two loose Pawns, I naturally offer to exchange Queens, and White of course refuses.} 19. Qf3 a6 20. Ne2 Qf6 21. Qg3 Ne5 {I centralize my Knight and threaten to remove a pair of Rooks.} 22. Rcb1 b5 23. Bd4 Qg6 24. Be3 f5 25. a4 bxa4 {White's last Q-side Pawn falls.} 26. Rb6 f4 {A Pawn fork, winning a piece.} 27. Bxf4 gxf4 {I expect White to move his Queen.} 28. Qxg6 Nxg6 {I'll gladly swap off the Queens.} 29. Rxd6 Rf6 30. Rd4 Rc2 {Now it's time to get aggressive.} 31. Nc1 Rfc6 {I focus my fire on the Knight.} 32. Rd8+ Kh7 {A safe haven.} 33. Nd3 Ne5 {When ahead, offer to trade pieces.} 34. Nb4 Rc6c8 {This neutralizes White's fork. Now the best he can do is trade Rooks...} 35. Rxc8 Rxc8 {..which he does.} 36. Nxa6 Nd3 {One of my Pawns falls.} 37. g3 fxg3 {I know it's not normally good to trade Pawns when materially ahead in the endgame, but I don't see much choice. ...P-B6 would leave me with a Pawn in a difficult spot to defend.} 38. hxg3 a3 {I know I won't actually queen this Pawn successfully but I hope to use it to win more material.} 39. Rd1 Rc1 {Pinning the Rook, and forcing the exchange.} 40. Rxc1 Nxc1 {Now I can win White's last piece...} 41. Nb4 a2 {...by advancing this Pawn.} 42. Nxa2 Nxa2 {I now have two options. I can try to win White's remaining two Pawns in return for my one, and attempt to checkmate with a B and N. I prefer option 2: preserve my last Pawn, trade the B for White's 2 P's and use the N to queen the P. I have to preserve the N because if the P stays on the R file the B will be "of the wrong color", while a Knight can cover a square of any color.} 43. Kg2 Kg6 {Time to activate the K.} 44. Kh3 Bd4 {And the B.} 45. f3 Bf6 {With my K and B in place, White cannot get rid of the P by advancing his P's to B4 and N5: I would play ...BxP, and replay to PxB with..PxP, the P being guarded by my K.} 46. f4 Nc3 {I start moving the N towards the scene of action.} 47. g4 Ne4 {Joining the fray.} 48. Kg2 Nc5 {I'm trying to prep for a Bishop sacrifice that will remove at least one of White's Pawns.} 49. Kf3 Be7 {Still maneuvering.} 50. Ke3 Nb7 {The N is headed for KB2.} 51. Ke4 Bf6 {Still readying things.} 52. Kd5 Nd8 {Almost there...} 53. Kd6 Bg5 {I offer the B, but White refuses it.} 54. Ke5 Nf7+ {I reach the desired spot.} 55. Ke4 Nd6+ {If Black plays the reply I think he will...} 56. Ke5 Bxf4+ {...which he does, I can force the sacrifice.} 57. Kxf4 Nf7 {Now White either has to let my K seize the vital square KN4, or advance his Pawn there and lose it.} 58. Kg3 Kg5 {I seize the square...} 59. Kh3 Ne5 {...and as the Pawn will fall, White resigns.}
