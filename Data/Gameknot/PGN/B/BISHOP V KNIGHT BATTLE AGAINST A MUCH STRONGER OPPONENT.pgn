1. d4 {Standard D4 opening} d5 2. c4 {Offer the trade} dxc4 {He accepts} 3. Nf3 {I do not worry about the c4 pawn and develop my kingside knight} Bg4 {Threat to my knight} 4. e3 {I do not worry about it yet (h3) instead i open up my attack on his undefended pawn} Nc6 {he threatens my d4 pawn and has some good jump points} 5. Bxc4 {I take his pawn} e6 {he responds and opens up his bishop and queen } 6. Nc3 {now i develop my knight} Bb4 {he threatens to take my knight and check my king} 7. Bd2 {I remove the pin off my knight and place my bishop on a nice square } Nge7 8. a3 {and now the fireworks start to begin} Bxc3 {he captures my knight setting up a bishop v knight snowdown} 9. bxc3 {here instead of capture with my bishop i decided to play pawn takes pawn which in the long run will clog up the center of the board and prevent his knights from doing any damage } O-O {I really thought he would take my knight here instead he castled which allowed me to play my next move and keep my kingside pawn structure  Here I play Be2   It was later pointed out to me that I could have played a4 and I would have eventually won the game as well, but I explored that line and found that you can promote later in the game and win.} 10. Be2 {It was just pointed out to me that i could have played e4 because the queen can always recapture at f3} Na5 {knights on the rim are grim (especially when i have 2 bishops with long scopes)} 11. Qa4 {forcing him to react to my moves} Nac6 {swings his knight back and its not doing much threatening d4 but I have way to much defense} 12. O-O a6 13. Qb3 {eying b7 } e5 14. h3 {and the action continues????} Bh5 {now his bishop is will be stuck} 15. g4 {;)} e4 {time for a trade? Ne5 is also a good move} 16. gxh5 exf3 17. Bxf3 {Now we have a BISHOP v KNIGHT battle but his pieces are all stuck while mine are all active.   I-D-J To be honest, I just started playing.  I have been watching some videos with some good annotations and I have been picking up a lot of new things in a short period of time but still make some interesting moves (9.Be2 - !?IDK) but this was the first time I actually felt like I understood my plan and his plan and made him react} b5 {futile attempt} 18. h6 Qd6 {Bringing out his queen finally} 19. hxg7 Kxg7 {kings defense is weak and his king is expose} 20. Bg2 {not letting him hit the check and opening up the board for my kingside pawns} Rad8 21. c4 Qg6 {not enough pieces to mount an attack on my king} 22. cxb5 {forcing action} axb5 23. Qxb5 {passed pawn with my LS bishop protecting the promotion spot } Rd6 {attempted counter attack brewing} 24. Rfb1 {counter avoided} Qc2 25. Rb2 Qg6 {:)} 26. Qf1 Qh5 27. Rb5 {Queen is stuck} Nf5 28. Rc1 Rg6 {another counter?} 29. Rxc6 {29. Rxc6!} Rxc6 30. Bxc6 {full control} Kh8 {super run away} 31. e4 Rg8+ {attempting to prolong} 32. Kh2 Qg6 {good NIGHT} 33. exf5 Qxc6 {Bishop>Knight this time} 34. Rc5 Qd6+ 35. f4 Rb8 36. a4 Rb3 37. Qg2 Qxd4 38. Rxc7 Rb8 39. Bc3 Qxc3 {this is where all hopes are lost} 40. Rxc3 Rg8 41. Qc6 f6 42. Qxf6+ Rg7 43. Rc8# {And that's all folks!    I-d-j Thank you for the comments I am going to explore a4 move some more.  I just started playing and Ive been reading a book and I'm at the point where it explores Bishop v Knight and I thought this was a good game showing how bishops can overpower knights.}
