[Opening "King's Indian (E97), orthodox, Aronin-Taimanov, bayonet attack"]

1. d4 {I usually check the opponent's games and see what he plays before playing my first move. I guess there still are a few defenses I'm not comfortable playing against but don't expect me to reveal them here.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {But the KID isn't one of them. Although it's been played by just about every world champion, I still don't have much faith in it. I've played it myself in a few games here, but it was more of an experiment than a serious attempt. It's not that I think the opening is bad, I just don't like the positions that Black gets out of it, in many lines he just seems to be hanging by a thread. White, on the other hand...} 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O {The classical line, which is also the most popular currently. A few decades ago the g3 systems and the Saemisch were very much in favor of the chess elite but playing so protracted has proved unnecessary against this defense. Beside, from this position, White and Black still have many ways to play and different setups.} 6. Be2 {White's idea is to simple complete development, while holding the center, for now and wait to see what Black does next.} e5 {I think it's because of this move that I don't like the KID very much for Black. I mean, what's the point of developing the Bishop at g7 if you're just going to hem it in as early as move six behind your own pawns? That being said, this move is objectively considered best and almost forced in order to secure a stable situation in the center and complete development.} 7. O-O {Playing 7. d5 was popular a long time before I was born but isn't anymore. After 7...a5, Black can intertwine his pieces in the center and secure a steady, promising game. Since 7...exd4 isn't much of a threat because after 8. Nxd4 Re8 9. f3!, White is just better.} Nc6 {The point of this Knight sortie is very deep. Black forces White to close the center, when he can slowly maneuver the pieces and start K-side operations. Notice that the Knight is better placed on e7, where it doesn't interfere with the Bc8 and from where it supports f5 and can later come to g6. This is just basic stuff about the KID, so if you know this already, feel free to skip the opening moves.} 8. d5 {The other alternative is 8. Be3, but the whole thing just looks needlessly messy. Besides, hitting a Knight with a pawn is always good fun.} Ne7 {OK, here we are. This is the main position of the Classical line. Variations aren't as important here as are ideas and knowing what to do. For example, Black's Bc8 is a very important piece, even if it doesn't look like it now. The same is true about White's Bc1. Let me just lay out some of the basic plans for both sides. White wants to use his better foothold in the center to squeeze Black's Q-side and win material there. Pushing either of the three pawns there, either separate or combined is a good way to achieve this. The c5 break is particularly appealing. Black on the other hand has already burned all his bridges and just wants to mate White. He'll start pushing his K-side pawns and try to land a piece sacrifice somewhere and bring his Queen in for the kill. Both sides try to mix defense and attack into their play and some of games that have been played with this lines by the great chess champions are very instructive.} 9. b4 {This is called the Bayonet attack. The older main line starts with 9. Ne1 and still many lines break off from there.} Nh5 {A typical maneuver for Black. Clearing the way for the f5 break and possibly bringing the to f4, where after a subsequent capture, his Bg7 might just live to see the light of day. } 10. Re1 {A prophylactic move. This strengthens the e-pawn in case of f5 and clears f1 as a retreat square for the Bishop in case Black should play Nf4.} a5 {A secondary variation. 10...f5 is the usual move. The idea of a5 is to make use of the early pawn advanced and remove one target from the Q-side, while bring his Rook into play. However this seems wrong in principle since opening lines on the Q-side can only favor me in the long term.} 11. bxa5 Rxa5 {Delaying the capture of the pawn can run into Nd2 and Black's pieces are too far apart to make anything work.} 12. Nd2 {Now the Nh5 is attacked and the White Knight will come to b3 with tempo.} Nf4 13. Bf1 b6 {I think this move was also unnecessary. This just helps me, as will be shown in a few moves.} 14. a4 Bd7 {Black should have focused on creating his own counterplay instead of trying to stop mine.} 15. Nb3 Ra8 16. a5 {Doing just what White is suppose to do in this line, open up lines on the Q-side. In hindsight, my opponent seems to have tried to do the same thing.} bxa5 17. Rxa5 Rxa5 18. Nxa5 Qb8 {This is still known theory but the line doesn't seem to promise Black anything good.} 19. Nb5 {Putting pressure on Black's pawns. Exchanging the Bd7 for the Nb5 will result is a prospectless game for Black, which will be left without an attack and with a weak c-pawn.} f5 {Black finally gets to make the most characteristic KID move, but this seems like the last nail in his coffin. In any case it's difficult to suggest a plan that can be executed without this move.} 20. g3 {I think this move deserves an exclamation mark, not necessarily because of the lines that support it, but for the idea behind it. It comes almost as a direct refutation of Black's last and is a good thing to remember and watch out for as Black.} Nh5 21. exf5 {Now Black has to capture with a piece on f5 or lose a pawn. My opponent chose the first but perhaps 21...Nf6 wasn't as bad. Losing a pawn in the KID is less dramatic than in other openings, since Black is playing for the attack only, his position cannot be sustained by normal means. But perhaps even after 21...Nf6, Black can't hope for much, after the very flashy Knight move 22. fxg6 hxg6 23. Nd4! and after a lot of forced exchanges, Black is still in misery.} Nxf5 22. Nc6 {This Knight has made quite a trip to get here. From g1-f3-d2-b3-a5-c6. And it still can't be put out of the playing field. In case of 22...Bxc6 23. dxc6 Nd4 (more than necessary, or else I play c5) 24. Bg2 Qb6 25. Be3 Kh8 26. Qd2 and Black is out of useful moves. The threats are g4 followed by capturing on d4 or capturing on d4 directly. In case of 26...Kg8, 27. Qa2! creates even more threats. Black is all tied up.} Qb6 {I think in view of my next move, 22...Qb7 would have been more adequate.} 23. g4 {A very easy move to see but not easy to convince myself to make it work. The downside is that my King is weakened and Black gets some activity for his pieces.} Nh4 {23...Bxc6 seems better here since after 24. dxc6 Nh4 25. Qd5+ Kh8 26. Be3 Qb8, Black might just hold. It won't be fun but it might just be tenable.} 24. Be3 {This Bishop is a late bloomer but it makes up for his inactivity so far.} Qb7 25. gxh5 Nf3+ 26. Kh1 Nxe1 27. Na5 Qa8 28. Qxe1 {This was the position I wanted when I played 23. g4. Black is in serious trouble here. The material deficit isn't immense but positionally he stands very bad.The c-pawn is very weak, his Bishops are very passive. The f-file can't be used for a while and even his King might become weak in the future.} Bxb5 29. cxb5 Qxd5+ {Regaining the material but still behind on position.} 30. Kg1 Qe6 {Black's only hope for counterplay lies in his central pawns. If he can get them rolling far enough, he should be able to create enough problems to save the game. But unfortunately for him and fortunately for me, he just doesn't have time to do that.} 31. h6 {A first finesse. Even though the pawn might drop later, it's a serious nuisance and can always be used to intimidate the Black King.} Bf6 32. Bg2 {The second finesse. Forcing the advancement of the Black pawns is the easiest way to break his position. The point is to be able to fix them and create points for my pieces to blockade them.} e4 {32...d5 needs to be looked at as well. After 33. Nc6 e4 (if Black tries to forgo a second pawn advance and hold the pawn abreast, Nb4 follows and he's forced to make the concession in worse circumstances) 34. Qa5 Qd6 35. Qa7! Qd7 36. Bc5 Re8 37. Bd4 Qd6 38. Bh3! (with the last piece brought into play, Black just can't hold any longer. The c-pawn drops and soon the game)} 33. Qc1 {The third and final finesse. This quiet Queen move connects all the pieces.} Qd5 {33...d5 looks very interesting and it might just draw unexpectedly.. After 34. Qxc7 d4 35. Bf4 e3 36. fxe3 dxe3 37. Qc6 Qxc6 38. Nxc6 e2 39. Bd2 Bg5 40. Bd5+ Kh8 41. Bc3+ Bf6 42. Ne5 e1Q+ 43. Bxe1 Bxe5 44. b6 Rc8 45. b7 Rc1 46. Kf2 Rb1 47. h4 and Black makes a study like draw. He either gives his Rook for my dsb and, after which I can't win since I don't have enough material to do so, or in case I sacrifice both Bishops to queen the b-pawn, erect a fortress which can be easily defended. It just goes to show the richness of a position in chess and that you should never give up looking for saving ideas.} 34. Bf1 {Now Black is in too much trouble. His pawns are stuck and he can't formulate a decent plan of action.} Qf5 35. Bc4+ {The Bishop belongs on e2 for now, but it makes sense to drive away the Black King to the corner.} Kh8 36. Be2 Rc8 {36...Bh4 looks more tenacious but I think it's also insufficient. After 37. Qc3+ (37. Qxc7 wins as well but in more moves) Qf6 38. Qxf6+ Bxf6 39. Bc4 and the White pieces will slowly make good work of the Black Rook and Bishop.} 37. Qc6 Qe6 38. Qb7 {Vacating c6 for the Knight.} d5 39. Nc6 {And here my opponent resigned. My guess is that he ran out of ideas. The Rook can't move or else c7 drops. Nd4 is also a big idea, as is b6. It's not so nice to have so many threats and not be able to execute them because your opponents wants to surrender.}
