[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Keres defence"]

1. d4 e6 {I don't know what this is, so I'll just play what feels natural.} 2. c4 d6 {As I said earlier, I don't know this opening but he seems to be playing a little cautiously. } 3. e4 {I take advantage and stick another pawn in the center.} Nf6 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 {I think I have a superior center, but can it hold?} a5 6. a4 Bd7 7. Bd3 Nb4 {I'm not sure what he's trying to do here, but it's a little annoying to have a knight lodged there.} 8. Bg5 Be7 {Too bad he noticed that I could win his knight with e5 if he didn't block.} 9. e5 {I decided to play it anyway.} Nxd3+ 10. Qxd3 {I certainly didn't mind that trade, it brought my queen out.} dxe5 11. dxe5 Ng4 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 13. h3 {I get rid of the knight} Nh6 14. Nb5 {Threatens a fork on c7} Bc6 {Discovers a defense.} 15. O-O-O {I know queenside castling might now have been wise because of the pawn cover being blown off, but this doubles my queen and rook on the open file.} O-O 16. h4 Nf5 17. g4 {I start a pawn storm} Rad8 {Hmmm complications} 18. Qc2 Bxf3 {I almost cried here. Luckily I found a way to win back my piece and not lose anything.} 19. Rxd8 Bxh1 20. Rxf8+ Kxf8 21. gxf5 Qc5 {And material is even.} 22. fxe6 {I miss a better move here} Qxe5 {But he gives me another chance and this time I see it.} 23. Qd1 {! Forks a mate threat and the bishop.} Be4 {?? misses it} 24. Qd8# {MATE! As always, please comment and rate.}
