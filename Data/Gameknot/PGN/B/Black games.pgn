[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {I love to play d5 after d4, because I learnt this black opening defence, from FM Charles Galofre via a video on chess.com, He calls it a universal system, } d5 {After Playing d5 my next move is usually c6 or gKnight to f6 or cBishop to f5 what your trying to achieve with black is a triangle on the light squares, once the c Bishop is outside the pawn chain then shut the door with pawn to e6, making your triangle complete if your allowed to do so, I believe this opening defense for black is some sort of slav or semi slav, I have adapted it even further from learning it originally, by altering it after several times being attacked on b7 or a7, got a little fed up so I bought a video on slavs and called it a6 } 2. Nf3 {My next move is as normal c6} c6 {Here on move 2 I am building my triangle on the light squares, my 3rd move if allowed is puting my c bishop to f5 which is outside my pawn chain} 3. Nc3 {ionescu played Nc3, so I will play Nf6, covering the square e4 and also d5 also developing my pieces} Bf5 {I have thought about the move and played my c bishop outside the pawn chain, my next move will be as I was going to move Nf6} 4. h3 {My opponent just played 4. h3, I am not sure why for definite he played h3, I think he is trying to stop my bishop going onto g4, threatening the knight defender on f3} h6 {This my 4. h6 is to protect the bishop if attacked by the Knight on h4 from Nf3,I can hide the bishop, I call it a car park just put it here on h7 if attacked and is protected by Rook on h8} 5. g4 {Here my opponent has attacked my bishop on f5 so I will park it in the car park on h7,} Bh7 6. Ne5 {His knight has just moved to e5 an ideal square to course mayhem, but my move will be my b8 knight to d7 attacking his knight on e5, } Nd7 7. Nxd7 {He then took my knight on d7 so I remove it with Queen to d7,} Qxd7 8. Bg2 {Here he plays Bishop to g2, I will castle long here giving me a rook behind my Queen on d8 giving me some power on the d file} O-O-O 9. e4 {He now played 9. e4 attacking my pawn on d5, To back up my d5 pawn I can either close the door with pawn to e6 or My knight to f6 which also attacks e4 and also protects d5 remembering my bishop on h7 which is aiming at e4, so he has 3 attackers attacking my pawn on d5, but I will have 4 protecters so I will win that d5 argument.} Nf6 10. e5 {He walks on by d5 pawn to e5, my problem here is I have my Queen on d7, where I should have put my Knight on d7 but with the queen on d7, I dont want to develop my knight onto g8 or e8, So I am forced to move my knight onto e4, which is being attacked by his bishop on g2 and his knight on c3, I have only 2 protecting the knight, so more of an even argument. } Ne4 {I move my knight to e4 awaiting his next move, will he attack it or not the ball is in his court.} 11. Bxe4 {He attacks my knight on e4 with his bishop on g2 } Bxe4 {I exchange his bishop with the bishop in the car park on h7, I don't know if he saw it, they can be a bit camouflaged in the corner, I have missed them before myself.} 12. Nxe4 {He removes my bishop on e4 I will look at this, and make my mind up what to do..!} dxe4 {I have decided to take the knight on e4, looking at the game at move 12. so far seems equal.} 13. O-O {My opponent ionescu, has castled short or king side, opposite to me long side or queen side } Qd5 {I have moved my Queen d7 to Qd5, which protects my e4 pawn and also could remove the pawn on e6 if he decides to push his pawn onto e6 in a forward direction, and also various other moves, and also if } 14. f3 {He now decides to attack me again with his pawn to f3 which attacks my pawn on  e4 several things always go through my mind which I learnt too take is a mistake, So I thought for now I would close the door a bit late but better late than never, with my e6 pawn, which also helps my development of my bishop on f8 can see daylight } e6 {I have now closed the door at e6 with my pawn I now await his next move, He now decides to take my pawn on e4 with his pawn on f3, giving me an easy take with my queen} 15. fxe4 {By him taking my e4 pawn leaving a semi open f file, my f7 pawn being unprotected as he has a rook on f1 scary... } Qxe4 {I have decided to remove the pawn on e4 with my queen, still equal black has kept equal up to move 15.} 16. Qf3 {He now attacks my queen on f3, which I thought was a bit foolish knowing all I have to do is take his pawn on d4 which is unprotected, and I also have check as well as a bonus yippee..} Qxd4+ {I take his pawn on d4 and check his king in the process, he has got bishop to e3 stopping check } 17. Be3 {He now stops check with his bishop onto e3, which is covered by his queen on f3. my move hmmm...} Qxe5 {My next move I have decided if he attacks my pawn on f7 then I can check his king on g3 with my Queen. I await his next move...!!!} 18. Qxf7 {He took the pawn on f7, Now it's up to me I have the option of checking his king on g3 or e3 which I also can take his bishop looks good, I don't see his queen on f7 as much of a danger even though he has the rook on f1 as back up..} Qxe3+ {I thought I might as well check him and also take his bishop on e3, which was quite good I thought I am now +4 I think he has miss calculated his queen taking my pawn on f7, I hope unless he is more of a threat than I first thought, but don't think so.. anyway I am a pawn up and a bishop} 19. Qf2 {He now returns his queen to f2 to block my check I have got got several candidate moves here for my queen, I can back off back up the board or keep the pressure on by attacking his pawn on h3 looks quite good} Qxh3 {I have started to gain an advantage on move 19. +5 now by taking his h3 pawn... awaiting his move } 20. Qg2 {He blocks and attacks my queen on g2, I can't see a much better move here on move 20. than } Qe3+ {I said I could not see a better move than than my queen to e3 check again going back and forth.. let's see what his next move is.} 21. Qf2 {Well its cat and mouse now he go's f2 blocking my queens check on his king and attacking my queen on move 21. what have I got now} Qe5 {Here I came up with this move which at first I thought I had made a mistake, if I analyzed it I might find I  had made a mistake I await his move..!!} 22. Rae1 {I said previous I thought I had made a mistake before I thought I should have moved direct to g5, he now brings his other rook into it on e1 threatening my queen on e5,  } Qg5 {So I move out of danger onto g5 now I think I should have moved there in the first place lol} 23. Qxa7 {He is going all out to attack my king for the first time in this game by taking the pawn on a7 a problem area in this defense,  but I have adapted this area because of the weakness on a and b 7} Bc5+ {He fell for that one checked his king and threatening his queen which in turn is covered by my queen on level 5, if he moves his king out of check, I can then take his queen or if he takes my bishop I can then take his queen on c5 with check again, He retires best thing to do I think }
