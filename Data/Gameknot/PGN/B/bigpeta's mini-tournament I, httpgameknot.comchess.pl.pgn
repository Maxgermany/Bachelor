1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Qc2 Nf6 5. Bg5 dxc4 6. Qxc4 Nbd7 7. Nbd2 h6 8. Bh4 Be7 9. e3 c5 10. Be2 {slightly better was dxc5 } b6 11. O-O {a little stronger is Nb3 guarding the d-pawn so as to avoid an isolated pawn if recapture with exd5 after cxd5 } O-O 12. Rfd1 Bb7 13. Rac1 Rc8 14. Nb3 cxd4 15. Qxd4 Rxc1 16. Rxc1 Qa8 17. Rc7 {Better is Qd1 which boosts the defence of the Non f3 without risking disrupting the pawn shield in front of the K.  Also it moves the Q away from the centre of the board where it is open to attack by minor pieces } Rd8 18. Qa4 g5 {much better was Kf8 moving towards supporting the B & N } 19. Bg3 a6 {slightly better is Nd5 attacking the R } 20. h3 {much better is h4 attacking the pawn structure also if gxh4 then Qxh4 bringing her over to attack the opening K-side } Nd5 21. Rxb7 Qxb7 22. Bxa6 Qa7 23. Bb5 Qxa4 24. Bxa4 Nb4 25. Nbd4 Nc5 26. Bb5 Nxa2 27. Bc7 Ra8 28. Nc6 Bf6 29. Bxb6 {mistake. sets up the Na4 fork which follows.  Better was Nfe5 linking the Ns deep in black's space and blocking the attack on b2. } Na4 30. Bxa4 Rxa4 31. b3 Ra6 32. Bd4 Bg7 33. Bxg7 Kxg7 34. Nfd4 Nc3 35. b4 {much better is f4 or g4 beginning the ofensive on both sides of the board. Plus giving the K room to move } Ra1+ 36. Kh2 Ra2 37. f4 {a little late as now the K is on the edge of the board and the b-pawn pinned to it } Nd5 38. fxg5 hxg5 39. e4 Nf4 40. Kg3 Rxg2+ 41. Kf3 Rg1 42. h4 Rf1+ 43. Kg4 gxh4 44. Kxh4 Re1 45.
