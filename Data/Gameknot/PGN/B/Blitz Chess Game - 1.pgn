[Opening "Dunst (Sleipner,Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"]

1. Nc3 {The Dunst Opening which, believe it or not, is considered an irregular opening.  For me, that was a shock, as I thought it was still more common then the Owen's, Grunfeld, or Baseman Defense.  But, those are just considered unusual, but the Dunst is considered even more though, and we don't see it often, which is why it would be irregular.} e5 {I am not surprised to see this because 2.d5? would be a mistake for the obvious reason.} 2. Nb1 d5 {Since the N moved back, it was now safe to play this.  But, is white making the right choice?  That remains to be seen.  With that being said, on a normal basis, 2.Nb1 would be considered pointless since the move does waist tempo because he could, instead, use the time to develop another piece.  But, this time it isn't because as tactical-abyss there is a strategy behind this.} 3. Nf3 {So, now he gets his other N ready.} Nc6 {But, black just continues developing.} 4. Ng1 {As noted when black played 2...d5 the same strategy that white had with 2.Nb1 exists now.  In other words, he played this for the same reason.} Nf6 {Developing his other N.} 5. Nf3 e4 {Going after the N, since it would appear that white waisted tempo by bringing to f6 and then retreating as we see a few times.  However, it's anything but easy, and believe it or not, black is starting to go wrong right here, as Joe implied.  But, the idea is alluring his opponent to play moves like this and keep running back as a trap because there is also a tactic, which we will see much later on.  While this seems irrelevant, it's actually vital because, as we know, players like tactical-abyss can think very far ahead.  By that, we mean well over 10 moves.} 6. Ng1 Bg4 {So, black things he has a noticeable advantage, at this point.  But, it's much harder then that.  White is still planning by moving back and forth, but in a very patient manner because chess takes patience, and it's important to note that this is reverse psychology or a trick because white wants black to keep bringing things in the center because of he will, subsequently, do later, as his long term plan.} 7. Nc3 Bb4 8. Nb1 O-O {Something that white had anticipated. } 9. h3 {But, now the trap starts setting in.  And, he showed this position, and what was implied is that white now has an advantage which will continue to grow.  So, already, things are starting to go downhill for black.  In fact, this was the plan behind  moving the N back forth, so on c3 and then b1, and the same with f3, followed by g1.  The idea was making it look like he had a weakness since he wasn't as well developed so that black would think he could crush him.  But, TA allured black into a trap because this was the plan and why it was also reverse psychology since black thought he'd won.  The reason being, however, is that it was a trap which black fell into, and from here, things are going to downhill for Joe's opponent.} Bh5 {Better was to retreat the B on away from the edge.  But, even if he did, like, for example, 9...Be6, black would still be in trouble, though.  But, this makes the situation worse.} 10. c3 {That was a big part.  That after hitting one B, Joe will hit the other.  Actually, it is the cornerstone to something a lot worse.  And, white doesn't need to develop, this time around because Joe noted that this move is quite ugly for black, and I absolutely agree. } Ba5 {I would've played 10...Bd6 for the same reason, but even then, as noted, white's advantage would be greater and would keep increasing.  Sure, it'd take longer, but black would be in very serious trouble.} 11. g4 {But, white is now guaranteed to win a piece.  And, as noted, this was the long term plan behind moving the same N back and forth several times.  By thinking that black had the initiative he went wrong, and with it, white will win something, with no way out of it.  That's why the General Opening Guidelines with TA, conversely, is meaningless.  The idea is that even if you know all of them and apply, if one doesn't know theory or reversed Psychology, he or she will wind up in trouble.  And, it is another reason why I view Joe as an exceptionally good teacher since he explains where one can, sometimes, do things differently and wind up with an advantage, and even, force a win. } Bg6 12. a4 {Unlike before, however, I don't know why white played this, but my guess is that he did so to open up the a file since, as I recently with shakertje in a Q sac that I annotated, one useful tactic is opening up the edge file for one of your R's.  That was how TA wound up winning against monkey kungphu, despite being a Q down early on and without the sac being on f7, either.} d4 {Getting ready to exchange pawns.} 13. g5 {But, it is too late for that.} Nd5 14. e3 {This is why.  The idea being that if black takes, his N will wind up indirectly pinned to the Q, when white recaptures which is the last thing you'd want since a pin like that is quite nasty.  The idea being that you don't want to, voluntarily, tie down any of your pieces as that would force a win even sooner.} d3 {To prevent the nasty pin and loss of a pin, but the damage has already been done, though.} 15. b4 {That's because, according to Joe, the game is now lost for black.  The reason being is that white is going to win a piece, regardless.  And, from then it'll go downhill, and yes, he will more material, and there's nothing that black can do about it.  In fact, without even using the analyze the board feature, I already see how this is going to happen.  And, when I recorded the positions and saw what he was playing, I predicted what was coming, as Homework.  My predictions were spot on and for the reason that I thought.  That's because white's DSB will be jammed, or locked in (if you will).  Therefore, black is not only going to get something, but then will liquidate R's right on the a file, adding insult to injury.  And, if you want to know the truth, this is what white was planning all along from the start.  In other words, this was the long term plan, so he thought ahead and calculated all these lines that have occurred.} Bb6 16. a5 Qxg5 {Black, might as well, grab something because he has a pawn.  But, still white wins a piece for pawn.} 17. axb6 axb6 18. Rxa8 Rxa8 19. h4 {And, as you might guess, this is where a passed pawn becomes especially because white is going to, once again, liquidate, after black retreats his Q.} Qf5 20. h5 Na7 21. hxg6 fxg6 22. Bh3 {Taking advantage of his opponents weakness.} Qg5 23. Qg4 {Adding to his advantages, white offers a Q exchange.  The idea is that he wants to further liquidate due to being ahead.  It is a very good strategy.} Qxg4 {?! I view this as an inaccuracy because black didn't have to do this.  And, one should not exchange pieces when behind.} 24. Bxg4 Nb5 {?? Trying to open up the a file for his R, as a passageway.  But, this is a blunder because white is going to get another piece, this time for free, after placing his opponent in check.  Better was 24...Kh8 or 24...Kf8  } 25. Be6+ Kf8 26. Bxd5 c6 {? Trying to alleviate the damage by attacking white's LSB.  But, this is a mistake, as now, black will lose another pawn.  Best was 26...Re8 to keep e4 safe.} 27. Bxe4 Ra1 {? Trying to compensate for lost material.  But, this is another mistake because, not only does white prevent that, but Joe will win another pawn.  Best 27...Rd8} 28. Bxd3 Nd6 {? I don't know why black this, but it is another mistake as white will win, yet, another pawn.  Better was to advance the h pawn, as it protects h7.} 29. Rxh7 c5 {Black intends to undouble his pawns here.  I know he because he moved it forward, and first I wasn't sure why.  But, this time, I studied it as Homework since I was interested in knowing what black was trying to do.  At first, I viewed it as pointless.  However, the idea is that white will take, and when he does, black takes back so that those pawns are no longer doubled.} 30. f4 {But, his plan doesn't work.  In addition, white has added an extra pawn chain, and since we're nearing the endgame, this, especially, plays a powerful role.} c4 {Trying to get the pesky B out of there.  } 31. Bxg6 {But, it's of no use since white grabbed another pawn, at this point.  I mean, black couldn't have avoided, but white decided to do it, while black was distracted which is a good strategy.} b5 {I don't know why he played this since the b pawn couldn't advance, anyway.} 32. Nf3 {Deploying his N and preparing to do something nasty with it.  The thing is that a B+N+R, when well coordinated are often used for a mating net.  With that being said, TA's plan is to push this N onto g5, and then check on e6.  That way after Ne6+, ...Kg8 is forced, and, subsequently, white mates with Rxg7#.} Nf7 {Seeing white's plan, black stops that, as now if white's N is to land on e5 or g5, black would exchange.} 33. d4 {So, white comes up with another plan.} cxd3 e.p. {This was part of the plan because Joe anticipated this.} 34. Bxd3 {I was told by Jack Stockel that when you have an advantage, the plan, if possible is to allow the opponent to make an en-pessant, for once he or she does, and you take back, you have a bigger advantage.  As usual, it's clear why, as now, white doesn't just have a passer, but several connected pawns (one being attached to the passed pawn.)  This adds insult to injury, and yes it is a perfect example of why one would anticipate the en-pessant, and where doing it benefits his or her opponent.} Ra6 {The idea being is that, on the next move, he will go after the B.} 35. Na3 {But, with this move, 34...Rd6 was, in my opinion, pointless.} Rd6 36. Nd4 {This is what he does, as now not only is everything safe for white, but black's b pawn is attacked, instead.} Nh6 {? I am not sure why he moved here, but it is another mistake as not only will white win another pawn, but he'll gain tempo, in the process.  And, especially in black's case, the loss of tempo is the last thing you want.  So, best was 36...Rb6, to protect b5.} 37. Naxb5 Rd7 38. Bc4 {For the first time, however, I don't know why white played this.  But, I know there is a plan, and as always, I like his plans since everything about it theory which is why you see them in his club.} Ng4 {? Planning to get the e pawn since his next move would've likely been 38...Re7  I'm not sure what the best move was, but this is another mistake because of what white is about to play.  Had he left his N where it was, white would not be able to play Nf5.  But, once he does...} 39. Nf5 {Black resigns.  The reason being is that he is so far behind.  And, to make matters worse, white is going to win another piece.  After that, white will get to liquidate.  The idea being that white is going to play 40.Rxf7  Then, black will be forced to play 40...Rxg7, as otherwise, white will immediately mate with 41.Rg8#  So, after 40...Rxg7, white has 41.Nxg7 and the position will just keep getting worse for black, so this time, there is no point in staying.  Overall, a very interesting, but the moral to this story is what tactical-abyss outlines.  In it, he said, ... "the lesson in this game is that advancing pawn moves on either flank side(K or Q)can have devastating effects,especially if one chooses a weird game like my Reverse Alekhine game bringing in my opponent like a fly to honey with his Bishops and more. A blocked center and either non existing attack Bishops or no Bishops in the endgame of course,help me considerably."  }
