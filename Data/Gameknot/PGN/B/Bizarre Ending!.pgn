1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This is a game played in a mini-tournament run by Gerhard/Chicoboy.  This is another game where I have kept it pretty tight and Operation Joblock has again been in full swing.  Natalia did manage to win a pawn but I still felt there was a lot of fight in the position and I felt confident of keeping her out so I offered her a draw.  She declined and then timed out!  The position was +2 in her favour according to gameknot analysis so The Black Queen is still waiting.  So how did this happen?  Well, we start off with a queen's pawn opening.} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 c6 4. Bg2 {4. Bg2 - kingside fianchetto.} Bf5 5. Nc3 Nbd7 {5. ...... Nbd7 - rapid development.} 6. O-O e6 7. Bf4 Bb4 8. Nh4 Bg6 9. a3 Bxc3 10. bxc3 {10. bxc3 - B for N trade.} Nb6 11. Qb1 Qd7 12. Qb3 Nc4 {12. ..... Nc4 - trying to avoid passivitis here.} 13. Nf3 O-O {13. ..... 0-0 - finally Henry is tucked away on the kingside.} 14. Ne5 Nxe5 15. dxe5 {15. dxe5 - knight trade.} Ne4 16. f3 Nc5 {16. ..... Nc5 - again keeping active.} 17. Qb4 b6 18. Ra2 Rab8 {18. ...... Rab8 - sticking a rook on the same file as the Wicked Witch of the West.} 19. Rb2 Qd8 20. Rfb1 {20. Rfb1 - but there is an ominous pile up of white pieces on the b column and that will eventually gain Natalia a pawn.} Qc7 21. Qd4 Nd7 {21. ...... Nd7 - adding protection to the b6 pawn.} 22. a4 a5 23. g4 h6 24. Bg3 c5 {24. ...... c5 - pawn break.} 25. Qe3 c4 26. f4 Bh7 27. Ra2 Qc5 28. Bf2 Qxe3 29. Bxe3 {29. Bxe3 - queen trade.} Rfc8 30. Rab2 Kf8 {30. ..... Kf8 - Henry moves towards the vulnerable pawn on b6.} 31. Bh3 Be4 {31. ..... Be4 - Fou Leblanc tries to give himself as much scope as possible and maintaining counter-pressure on the pawn on c2.} 32. Bd4 Ke8 33. Kf2 {33. Kf2 - Natalia has the same idea.} Kd8 34. Ke3 Kc7 35. Kd2 {35. Kd2 - both our vulnerable pawns are now protected by our kings.} Kc6 36. f5 g5 37. fxg6 e.p. Bxg6 {37. ..... Bxg6 - pawn trade.} 38. Bg2 Kc7 39. Rf1 Rcf8 40. Rf4 Kd8 {40. .... Ke7 - it is a case of scratch around and trying to hold position.} 41. Rb1 Ke7 42. e4 {42. e4 - this pawn break will smash up my queenside pawn structure.  In hindsight I am wondering whether c4 was a mistake.} dxe4 43. Bxe4 Rfc8 44. h4 h5 45. g5 {45. g5 - I was expecting PxP but at least my kingside pawns are safe for now.  Only trouble is, Fou Leblanc becomes one of them!} Rcg8 46. Bc6 Nc5 47. Rxb6 Nd7 48. Rb5 Rxb5 49. Bxb5 {49. Bxb5 - well, I'm now a pawn to the bad but can Natalia make something of this?  We shall see.} Rc8 50. Rf1 Kd8 {50. .... Kd6 - still scratching around.  Next move I play my rook to b8 and offer that draw.  Natalia declined it without making a move and she timed out a day or so later.  I will leave you, the Inquest Jury to chew this one over.  Kind regards - Joanne} 51. Rb1 Rb8 {}
