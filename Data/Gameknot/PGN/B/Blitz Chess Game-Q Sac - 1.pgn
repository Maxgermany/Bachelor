1. e4 {Standard.} c5 {Yes, I also would've played this, as I like the Sicilian.} 2. Qh5 {This is against General Opening Priniciples, but does it make a difference.  In this case, it dosen't.  In fact, during that game that I won after what should've been lost from an improper opening, that I now tell my students.  The win was from the fact that my opponent missed a mating sequence on 6 occassions, I was just using memory techniques since it was a struggle.  And, I thought about what this senior master did in that kind of situation where his opponent was beating him, and more or less, followed the same technique.  Proof that you can learn lot from reading his posts and studying games by stronger players.} Nf6 {The typical consequence of bringing the Q out early.  Usually, when the Q retreats, the opponent can continue developing, get better control of the center, and castle sooner.  But, it won't stop Joe from following through on his plans.  Instead, he is going to give up his Q, and with it, there is an important lesson. } 3. Qxf7+ {So, it starts with this move.} Kxf7 {Forced, but even if it were not, black would've played it as it's, obviously, best.  However, the game isn't that obvious and is more complex, which is something that I learned by studying it.} 4. Nc3 {So, white is going back in book by continuing to develop.} b6 {Fianchettoing and getting a solid pawn chain, which as Susan Polgar emphasizes, that it's important in the opening.} 5. Nf3 {With that being said, white continues developing, as well.} Bb7 {Nothing new here.  However, even though it dosen't develop, this is where I would've deviated from the guidelines with 5...h6 to prevent white's next move.} 6. Ng5+ {In my opinion, Joe's gaining tempo, in the process.  So, that, if black retreats in the right place, white will continue to develop and prepare to castle.} Kg8 {?? Unless I'm missing something since I'm known to do so, best was 6...Ke8, to prevent what's about to happen next, as now, black will, at the very least, lose a pawn.  Usually, it wouldn't matter, but the point is that you still must be careful, with any opponent, especially someone of this strength.  At first, I viewed this as a mistake for the lost of the e pawn, but the reality is that it loses much more and will, at the very least give white total compensation with, in fact, a small advantage.} 7. Bc4+ e6 {Forced.} 8. Nxe6 {Now, it might not seem so, but this is how 6...Kg8  That's because it's worth noting that what black doesn't realize is that, he's in a lot of trouble, and there's only one way to get out.} dxe6 {?? This isn't it, though.  At this point, black felt that he had won something else and was increasing his advantages, but there's where one goes wrong.  Instead, black in addition to having lost a pawn, also had to give up his Q.  Therefore, there was one ways out.   It was 8...Kf7, in which white, immediately, takes the Q.  But, with this move, however, white will mate, immediately.  As they say, "To take is a mistake".  That especially applies here, and  it's worth noting that while it appears so, 8...Qe7 doesn't help either.  9.Ng5+, Qf7 (forced) 10.Bxf7#} 9. Bxe6# {The moral to this story, as per what Jack Stockel and I annotated with anitam.  Yes, C++ was right that there was a little more to it, but here; it especially applies here since TA implied it at his club which I absolutely agree with.   That's due to one of Jack Stockel's annotation where a player lost to him for the same reason.  "When you think that you have won or are in a winning a position, be very careful, and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise, you might start making mistakes and losing the game."  To support it's important to note that many players, after having had won the Q early think that it's won.  So, it doesn't matter what else they play, even weak moves.  But, that is what seals their fate.  The idea being is that just because you have the advantage doesn't mean that you should become overly confident.  Instead, it's important to play the same way, as you would with any game.  That's because becoming careless could cost you the game, as it did here.}
