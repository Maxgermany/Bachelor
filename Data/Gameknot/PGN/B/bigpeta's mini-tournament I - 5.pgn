1. d4 {Background to opening choice When playing against a higher grade player I prefer to play a more closed opening} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bd2 {Shades of Nimo Inidan but not an opening I know very well. Happy to learn though} d5 {4.....d5 seems a bit aggressive for this type of opening. Potentially leaves a "hole" at e5. We shall see  } 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 b6 {6........b6 Acknowledge this could be means of developing bishop. NOt sure this is the best option } 7. Bd3 {7 Bd3 Looking to complete development but acknowledge White's position does seem a bit cramped} Bb7 8. O-O dxc4 9. Bxc4 {9 bxc4 Acknowledge potential risk to king side pawn structure (if Queen was to move) and Black's control of long diagonal and care required} Nbd7 10. Re1 Re8 11. a3 {11. a3 taking out any potential risk from black playing ne4} Bxc3 {11 a3 Looking to take out any potential threat from Black playing Ne4} 12. Bxc3 Ne4 13. d5 {13 d5 Prepared to sacrifice benefit of bishop pair to close down the diagonal} Nxc3 14. bxc3 exd5 15. Bxd5 {15 Closing diagonal achieved but with downside of isolated queen side pawns. Black might have been able to take better advantage by swapping bishops instead of 15....c6 } c6 16. Bb3 Qe7 17. Rc1 Rad8 {18 h4 Looking back white queen side was weak and h4 was intended to prepare NG5 and putting some pressure on Black f pawn Now looks a bit far fetched} 18. h4 Nc5 {19......N xb3 Takes bishop out but not sure removing Black Knight from pressurising centre is worth this } 19. Qc2 {19 Qc2 As well as shoring up queen side (and avoiding attack from R d8) White is looking to increase latent threat on king side} h6 20. Rcd1 {20 Looking to compete for control of d file} Nxb3 21. Qxb3 c5 22. Rxd8 Rxd8 23. Rd1 Bxf3 24. gxf3 Qxh4 {23 Rd1 Idea was to compete for the d file control but simply underlined weakness of h4} 25. Rxd8+ Qxd8 26. Kg2 {26 Move into end game with White weak pawn structure a handicap.} Qg5+ 27. Kf1 h5 28. Qd1 {28 Retreating of Queen requiresd to deal with passed pawn. Advantage is with Black} h4 29. Qd7 {29 Qd7 Trying to prevent h3 as well as promoting some counter play on QUeen side } f5 30. Qxa7 h3 31. Qb8+ {31 Qb8ch enables white's queen to move to defend 32......Kf7 would have been a better choice (nearer the centre)} Kh7 32. Qh2 Qg2+ {32.......Qg2ch. Exchange of QUeens appears to be a mistake given position of Kings and pawn formation} 33. Qxg2 hxg2+ 34. Kxg2 b5 35. Kg3 {34.....b5 Moving king to the centre would have been a better choice} Kg6 36. Kf4 Kf6 37. e4 {37 e4 Looking to create space in the centre} g5+ 38. Ke3 Ke5 {39 Kd3 White is still hanging on but gets a lifeline 38......c4ch would have been a better choice } 39. Kd3 fxe4+ 40. fxe4 Kf4 41. f3 {Alternative would be Ke5 } Kxf3 {41.....Kxf3 Proved to be a mistake in the long term} 42. e5 g4 43. e6 g3 44. e7 g2 45. e8=Q g1=Q 46. Qe4+ Kg3 {46......Kg3 47 Qg6ch No point in white trying to play a succession of checks. More central position of King is decisive} 47. Qg6+ Kf2 48. Qxg1+ Kxg1 49. Ke4 Kf2 50. Kd5 c4 51. Kc5 Ke3 52. Kxb5 Kd3 53. Kb4 {}
