1. e4 c5 {Sicilian Defense, black's most common and highest scoring reply. Known both for its dynamic games and high following among top players, the Sicilian is often the defense for people who love aggressive games, and don't mind studying a lot of theory} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {The most common moves here are 3. d4 (The Open Sicilian), and moves like 3. Bb5+ (The Moscow Variation), however my opponent played this Bc4 move. I always see this move, yet I feel it's basically handing Black equalization, as Black can usually build up a nice center with ...e6 and ...d5 to follow (which would also kick the c4 bishop with tempo).} Nf6 {My standard response, preparing ...e6 and ...d5, plus developing.} 4. Nc3 Nc6 {I could have played e6 here, but I usually prefer to develop my Queen's Knight first.} 5. d3 e6 {And my plan starts to take action.} 6. Bb5 {Perhaps he noticed d5 was coming and just evacuated early, but this is the loss of tempo I described earlier.} a6 {I decided to make him move one more time, and I welcome the exchange since the doubled pawns will only bolster the center I am about to erect, plus it opens up a b-file that will be great for my rook.} 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 8. Bg5 {Again wanting to trade off bishop for knight, maybe my opponent loves his horses.} d5 {I ignore it this time, and finally play ...d5} 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. exd5 cxd5 {After the smoke clears, I no longer have doubled pawns, but a very strong center, an semi-open b file, and the bishop pair.} 11. O-O Bd6 {Developing, and pointing straight towards the king's castled position.} 12. Re1 O-O 13. d4 Rb8 {I was debating whether I should do this move, or wait until the c-file opened up and use that instead. I chose this in the end because I would have another rook to come over to the c-file, and the control of both half-open files. Along with the bishop pair in an open position, I figured I would serve extremely well.} 14. b3 cxd4 {Opening up the c file, and the position in general. This is always good when you have the bishop pair, as bishops thrive in open positions, whereas knights love closed positions. } 15. Qxd4 Qxd4 {I played this partly because this was a timed game and I couldn't think of any great squares to move my Queen to on the spot. Besides, I figured the prospects I already had should serve me well enough.} 16. Nxd4 Bd7 {Connecting the rooks, and preparing Rfc8} 17. Nf3 {?! I wasn't sure of this move, it seems as if it's just wasting tempo. Maybe my opponent was preparing to redirect his knight to e5 and try to exchange the knight for my bishop?} Rfc8 {Enacting my plan, and also attacking the undefended c3 knight. If I can get this knight to move, I win a pawn on c2.} 18. Re3 Bb4 {Attacking the knight once again, it has to move now.} 19. Ne2 Rxc2 {There goes the pawn.} 20. Nfd4 {Funny how the same knight comes right back to d4 anyway.} Rc7 {I chose c7 and not c8 since I wanted to double rooks on the now fully open c-file anyway, so going back to c8 just to come to c7 made no sense.} 21. a3 Bc5 22. b4 Ba7 {My bishop got kicked around a bit, however it came at the cost of weakening his queenside. I also managed to keep my sights on the a7-g1 diagonal, meaning the knight on d4 needs to stay put or else my opponent will be down the exchange.} 23. Rf3 Bb5 {My LSB wasn't finding any good squares, and so I don't mind trading it off for his knight.} 24. Nxb5 axb5 25. h4 {? White needs to turn his full attention to the queenside or else he'll simply get steamrolled.} Rc2 {Rooks on the 7th rank are happy rooks. This move also comes with tempo, since the knight can't go to d4 without it's twin knight protecting it.} 26. Nf4 Rbc8 {Doubled rooks on the only fully open file, soon enough I will storm into White's camp and gobble up all he's good for.} 27. Kh2 {Perhaps trying to avoid trading rooks after 27.--- 27...Rc1+, but this option just drops a pawn} Rxf2 28. Rxf2 Bxf2 {The bishop hiding on a7 jumps back into action.} 29. Kh3 Rc4 {Compare the pieces here. My rook is active, on an open file and attacking pieces. Meanwhile White's is currently staring at a brick wall on a3. My bishop has a lot of movement through my pawns, and a lot of pawns of White's to attack. Meanwhile, White's knight isn't doing a whole lot, and it doesn't really have anywhere good to go.} 30. g3 Bd4 31. Rf1 Bb2 {White's a and b pawns were going to fall, and I would then have 3 passed pawns to run to queening squares. Due to all of this, my opponent resigned in this position. I hope you enjoyed my commentary, please comment with any lines I may have missed, or any improvements in general!}
