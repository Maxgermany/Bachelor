1. c4 {I prefer c4 over e4 and d4, since c4 does not obstruct any knights.} g6 {It is important to understand every positional weakness created by each of your opponent's moves as early as move 1. This move is now a weakness to target with plans of h4 h5 hxg6 opening my rook's file with tempo, while weakening Black's pawn structure if Black is unable to recapture with hxg6. But I am not going to waste all those moves just to weaken Black's pawn structure. h4 gives me a head-start on that potential middlegame plan.} 2. h4 {Normally a move like this is considered weak, but since there is a target to attack, this is a great move.} Nf6 3. Nc3 {I respond by controlling the same square's Blacks knight did} Bg7 {Black develops his dark squared bishop, so I will too.} 4. d3 {d4 is no good here, because it gives Black a target to attack. d3 also solidifies my pawn structure.} h6 {This gives me another weakness to target on the kingside} 5. Bd2 e5 6. Qc1 {Black is restricted from castling for now.} Nc6 7. Nd5 {I think e4 was better since I am moving the same piece twice. But if Black trades knights, then I'll get an open c-file, and superior control of the center.} d6 {Here I think the best idea for me was e4 Ne2 Ng3 h5 where if Black pushes with g5, I get the f5 square.} 8. g3 {Not good. This obstructs the g3 square for my knight, obstructs the g3 square for my rook, obstructs the g3 square for my bishop. etc.} Be6 9. e4 {Bolstering my knight on d5, Black will have to move his c6 knight if he wants to chase me away with c6} Nd4 {Since I already obstructed my position with g3, I decided that this wasn't going to be an active piece game, and that my plans would have to be entirely strategic. Even though my next move obstructs my position even more, it makes everything solid so that I can organize my undeveloped forces in the middlegame. My plan is to finish developing and then boost with g4-h5} 10. f3 c6 11. Ne3 Nh5 12. Kf2 {Everything is secure on the kingside, but Black owns the queenside dark squares.} Qb6 {I need Black's queen out, so I will use my pawns + threats of opening the b-file} 13. b4 {Threatening c5} c5 {Black stops immediate pawn invasion, but now he has the b-file to worry about} 14. Rb1 Qc7 {Suddenly Black's superior pieces are targetless, so my solid position counts for more.} 15. Bh3 {After Bxh3 Rxh3 (not Nxh3? Nxg3!) there is one less piece defending Black's kingside, so Nd5 f4 is now an idea} f5 {Black wants to attack on the kingside first, but this move is very weakening to the 7th rank,} 16. Nd5 {Exploiting Black's badly placed h5 knight. Black must lose a tempo or the minor exchange} Bxd5 {Black is left with severely weakened light squares around his king, and I can forcibly open the c and b-files for my major pieces. } 17. cxd5 Ke7 {Black's king is in trouble, because my dark square control prevents him from castling kingside, while my open files prevent him from castling queenside. Black chooses to keep his king in the center, but there it can be harassed by my extra bishop.} 18. g4 {Opening the diagonal for my bishop} fxg4 19. Bxg4 Nf6 20. Bh3 {I lost some tempo, but my bishop now serves as an incredibly strong attacker with nothing that can oppose it.} b6 {Black is trying to make sure I cannot create any weaknesses on his queenside, but his dark squared bishop is very bad, so now both my bishops are monstrous attackers. If the b-pawns are exchanged, then Black's queen will have to play nursemaid to the a5 square and the 7th rank} 21. Ne2 {I have finished developing, and can now aim to exploit my control of the kingside light squares. One more waste move by Black and he could find himself victim to an attack by my superior bishops} Raf8 {This is actually one of the worst moves Black could've made, obstructing his own king, taking away his bishop's only square, and leaving the back rank open if Black's king goes back to e8 or d8. For sure there must be some way I can exploit my dominant rook and bishops vs. Black's king and queen} 22. Nxd4 {First I'll cancel out Black's active piece} exd4 23. bxc5 {Now I have 4 active pieces against one. Black is lost no matter which way he recaptures. If he recaptures with queen, then Bb4 Qxc1 Rhxc1 and my bishop's control of c1 allows my rook to invade via c7 and win the a7 and b6 pawns. If he recaptures with d-pawn, then I'll have 2 connected passed pawns in the center, and my diags can aid them after Bf4 d6 and Qc4} bxc5 {But giving my rook the wide open file is the most losing. Like I said before, Black's 1 piece cannot play nursemaid to the potential squares of my 2 pieces} 24. Ba5 {!! A deflection sacrifice. Now my rook dynamically invades the 7th rank, and since Black's rooks are inactive, the back rank is also open, so my queen and rook can occupy them for a mating attack} Qxa5 25. Rb7+ {If Nd7 then Rxd7+ Kf6 Qf4#} Kd8 26. Qb2 {Now threatening to get both majors to the open ranks with tempo} Ke8 {Black realizes his only chance to escape will be to f7 then g8. Black is still far from having enough tempi to escape the attack} 27. Rb8+ Kf7 28. Be6+ {But sadly I own those light squares too. It seems like I am up a piece rather than down a piece} Ke7 29. Qb7+ {My queen, rook, and bishop are at their optimal locations. Once Black's king is on the 3rd rank, my rook will serve no purpose on the back rank, and I can just leave it hanging to give me time to finish the attack with my diags} Nd7 30. Qxd7+ Kf6 31. Qxd6 {Black's queen will have no more safe checks after I escape with Kg3, so there is no way to stop e5# or Bg8# My queen, bishop, and pawns are stronger than Black's queen, bishop, and rooks} Rh7 32. Bg8# {Black's pieces are on the kingside, so he was unable to defend against my invasion from the queenside.}
