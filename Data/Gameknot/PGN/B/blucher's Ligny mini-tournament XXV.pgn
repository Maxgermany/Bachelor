1. d4 {White opens up with queens pawn...} d5 2. Nc3 {interesting move...} Nf6 3. e3 e6 {normal development on both sides} 4. Nf3 Bb4 5. Bd2 c5 {hmmm, maybe a little gambit here?} 6. dxc5 {gambit accepted} Bxc5 7. Na4 {knight on the rim is dim...} Bd6 8. Bb5+ Bd7 {develop bishop and preventing check...} 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {queen takes instead because I want the knight out of my sight.} 10. b3 {interesting move... leaving the knight in the corner.} Nc6 11. Bc3 {hmm sneaking that bishop out.} Be7 12. Bd4 {why not trade?} Nxd4 13. Qxd4 O-O {king safety first!} 14. O-O Rfc8 {hmmm rook to an open file seems good especially on that weak c-pawn.} 15. c3 Qc7 {lets make double attack} 16. h3 b5 {attacking the white knight at a4 knight which will eventually lead to a pawn advantage.} 17. Nb2 Qxc3 {extra pawn awarded=)} 18. Rfc1 Qxd4 {trade while I am winning.} 19. Rxc8+ Rxc8 20. Nxd4 a6 21. Nd3 Ne4 {i want my outpost} 22. Rc1 Rxc1+ {I decided to trade here not to give up my open file.} 23. Nxc1 Ba3 {hmm i don't like the knight.} 24. Nde2 b4 {maybe a bishop outpost.} 25. f3 Nc3 {trade?} 26. Kf1 Bxc1 {why not trade? knights are better than bishops in endgames.} 27. Nxc1 a5 28. Ke1 {looks like white has to use the king to protect the pawn to free his knight.} f5 {pawn charge!} 29. Kd2 Kf7 30. Kc2 Ke7 {time for the king to attack} 31. Kb2 Nb5 {moving knight to b5 will prevent white pushing pawn to a3} 32. Ne2 h5 {This is the losing move for me pushing pawn to h5 will lead white knight to f4, if i push pawn h4, knight to g6 check!} 33. Nd4 {luckily white made the wrong move haha, sign of relief.} Nxd4 {why not trade when you are winning.} 34. exd4 g5 {pawn charge.} 35. Kc2 Kf6 {throwing my king in.} 36. Kd3 g4 {free up a little space for my king to get through huh?} 37. h4 {white responds, nope you are not gonna get it.} f4 {well I always got other pawns to push} 38. Ke2 {haha you better retreat.} g3 {hm why not push pawn to get him all jammed up.} 39. Kd3 Kf5 {oh boy time for me to make my move.} 40. Ke2 e5 {this forces white to trade pawns, if white king to d3 black pawn toe e4 check? not sure about it.} 41. dxe5 {white trades pawn.} Kxe5 42. Kd3 {hmm looks like a draw from here xD.} Kd6 {not giving up my kings position.} 43. Ke2 {smart move white king to e2 instead of d4 if white king to d4, black king to c6 and whites king is force to move back which leads black king to c5 gaining a whole significant advantage in position.} Kc6 44. Kd2 {smart move not falling for any tricks keeping king away from d3. if white king to d3 black king to c5 which forces white king to retreat back.} Kc5 45. Kd3 {looks like a draw now would you say?} a4 {pawn sacrafice, also my game winning move.} 46. bxa4 {white of course takes if white doesnt take white will have to give up his/her king's position.} Kb6 {setting up for my king to charge in on the right side.} 47. Kd4 {take my free pawn if you wish I don't care haha.} Ka5 {going for the attack now!} 48. Kxd5 Kxa4 {yummy yummy.} 49. Kc4 {not going to let you push that pawn white says.} Ka3 {well let's see...} 50. Kb5 {pawn exchange!} Kxa2 51. Kxb4 Kb2 {race of the kings} 52. Kc4 Kc2 53. Kd4 Kd2 {looks like my deep pawn structure prevails.} 54. Ke4 Ke2 55. Kxf4 Kf2 {hahahaha, I will get my queen first.} 56. Ke5 Kxg2 57. f4 {pawn storming, sorry its too late.} Kh3 58. f5 {go pawn!} g2 59. f6 g1=Q {i get there first=)} 60. f7 Qg7+ {nope you are not going to make it.} 61.
