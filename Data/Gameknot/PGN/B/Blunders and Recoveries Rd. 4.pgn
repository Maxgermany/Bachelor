1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg4 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Nbd2 Bd6 {Openings like this, I've seen them a thousand times. But it seems each time I have been missing something!? On move 5 I always play d3, however, opening databases, my chess engine, and my chess friends all say to either castle or move Nc3. This may be something to look at for previous use!} 8. d4 {Ouch! the computer does not like d4. It seems that my bid for the center can easily be reversed by exd4, Bxd4-c5.} Qe7 9. dxe5 Bxe5 10. Nc4 Qb4+ {Huh-oh. Here I missed that annoying queen check that used to be all to common in my chess games. I know that I only lose a pawn, but I will need all my pawns! Slightly more accurate than Qb4+ was Bxf3 followed by Qb4+. This eliminates the option that I make use of here by removing my knight.} 11. Qd2 Qxc4 12. Nxe5 Qxe4 13. Nxg4 Qxg4 14. O-O O-O 15. Rad1 {My situation is not yet terrible, and might be pushed towards a draw. I double up on the open file! I know if I sit around and do nothing my opponent will capitalize on his advantage.} Qe6 16. b3 Ne4 17. Qb4 b6 18. Bxb6 {OK, so I knew this was probably a bad idea when I played it. My thought process was that I was getting my pawn back, and after he recaptures I can play Rfe1 pinning the knight and getting the piece back. Now this works, but I don't actually win the pawn back. I wont go into detail of this variation but after [cxb6  19.Rfe1  f5. 20.f3  c5. 21.Qa4  b5. 22.Qa5  Qf6. 23.fxe4 fxe4], I have indeed lost my pawn once again. Thankfully he did not play this line.} cxb6 19. Rfe1 Rad8 20. Rxd8 Rxd8 21. f3 c5 22. Qxe4 Qxe4 23. Rxe4 {He plays Rad8?? without f5 my position becomes a bit more solid, I can trade off on d8 and then I have to play f3 to avoid back rank mate when I capture on e4. But the knight is not going anywhere cause its still pinned, so I can just capture next move.} f5 24. Re6 Rd1+ 25. Kf2 Rd2+ 26. Re2 Rxe2+ 27. Kxe2 Kf7 28. Kd3 {With the trading off of the rooks the endgame became less complicated, as I don't have to calculate so many possibilities now. Since his king is so far on the kingside, I figured that I would go for some play on the queenside.} b5 29. a4 Ke6 30. axb5 axb5 31. c4 b4 32. f4 h6 33. h4 Kf6 34. Ke3 Kg6 35. Kf3 Kh5 36. Kg3 {This is now looking totally like a draw, I'm seeing no way that he can break through if I just sit back and defend.} g5 37. hxg5 hxg5 38. fxg5 Kxg5 39. Kf3 Kf6 40. Kf4 Ke6 41. Kg5 Ke5 {ok, here I got a bit carried away. I thought that I might try to make the position more complicated in the hopes that my very young and slightly lower rated player would make a mistake. I was calculating that he could not run his king over to b3 to capture my pawns because I thought I would be able to capture f5 and promote first. Now as it turns out I was one move off in my calculations because either he promotes second with check, or he promotes first. Either way, he would be winning after trading queens and capturing c4.} 42. g3 Ke6 43. Kg6 Ke5 44. Kg5 {Once again, I could have brought it back to a drawn position after 42...Ke6 if I had played Kf4. But as it turns out, my opponent was not willing to calculate the winning line. I offered a draw after the first repetition and he accepted it in a clearly winning position.  A close call for me on this one, and it defeated the invincible mentality that I had begun to adopt. For round 5 I had pre-arranged to take a half point bye, so I was still in the running for first place, but it wasn't going to be as easy as it had first appeared!  Next round will include some fun opening tricks and nice little ending comeback.}
