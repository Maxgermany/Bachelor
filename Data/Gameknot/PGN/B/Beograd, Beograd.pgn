[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 {This is one of my favourite games and a game which every beginner chess player should see. In this game Boris Spassky demonstrates his ability to sacrifice accurately against Bent Larsen. It also shows how powerful a passed pawn can be.  1.b3:   A typical Larsen move. Larsen was an adventerous player who allways like to play for wins. Larsen was also famous for this opening move, b3 which was rightfully named after him (Nimzovich-Larsen attack). However, this move is considered "less perfect" compared to the "perfect five" (e4, d4, c4, Nf3 and g3). One might ask why as g3 and b3 are very alike but there are two differences between them:  1. b3 followed by Bb2 does not help K-side castling where as g3 and bg2 does. 2. To enhance the power of the bishop on b2 white will probably play f4 which weakens the K-side but to enhance the power of a bishop on g2 white can play c4 which doesn't weaken the K-side.} e5 {Black has plenty of options (e5, d5, c5, Nf6) but this move is probably the best. Black tries to limit the power of white's bishop on b2 (when it gets there). However, the e pawn being the weaker pawn compared to the d pawn may come under attack from the bishop on b2.} 2. Bb2 {The logcal follow up attacking the e pawn.} Nc6 {Developing and neutralising white's threat. The other possible move was d6 but the text move keeps blacks' options open.} 3. c4 {White seizes control of d5 with a good move. The other option was e4 but after 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 the bishop on b2 is out of action and black has an easy game.} Nf6 {Simple developing.} 4. Nf3 {A interesting move by Larsen. White dares the e pawn to advance which gains time but as compensation, white gets full control of the a1 h8 diagonal. The idea behind this move is similar to the Alekhine Defence (1.e4 Nf6).} e4 {What I said before about gaining time. } 5. Nd4 {Ng5 risks discovered attacks if the Nf6 moves. Therefore the knight will have to be protected by a pawn wasting more time.} Bc5 {A good move from Spassky. Black forces white to waste more time by moving the knight again.} 6. Nxc6 {The only logical move. Nf5 is met with 6...d5 with a massive centre. (If 7.Nxg7 then Kf8 and the Knight is trapped. } dxc6 {An excellent move. Usually it is best to caputre towards the centre but Spassky accurately analyses that white is behind in development and with this move he opens the diagonal for his other bishop to come in and help an attack.} 7. e3 {White must get the bishop out to be able to castle.} Bf5 {Developing.} 8. Qc2 {An interesting move. The queen now puts pressure on the e-pawn and prevents the e pawn from moving as Qxf5 wins material (all this will come clear on whites 10th move). However, this does nothing to help the K-side development and perhaps Be2, 0-0 and then this move is better.} Qe7 {Black bolsters his e-pawn as it is a real hazard for white. He also prepares Q-side castling which is a good idea as the Bb2 could be dangerous if he castles K-side.} 9. Be2 {Preparing castling.} O-O-O {Simple castling one might think, but watch the Rook on the d file and the pawn on d2...} 10. f4 {As said in my first comment, white this move is usually played to enhance white's bishop. This is also the main idea behind Larsen's Qc2 move as exf en passant Qxf5 wins. However, white should have played Bxf6 exchanging blacks knight because the following move puts him in trouble...} Ng4 {! An excellent move by Spassky which prevents castling! If 11. 0-0 then Rxd2! wins material as Qxd2 loses to Bxe3  forking the queen and king and winning Two pawns and a queen for a rook and bishop. Furthermore, Black threatens Qh4  with a massive attack.} 11. g3 {The queen must be kept out of h4 at all costs.} h5 {The beginning of one of the greatest attacks in history. Black plans to play h4 with a massive attack on white's k side.} 12. h3 {A plausible try by Larsen to move the Knight from g4 but the h pawn is too strong.} h4 {! Spassky makes this excellent move, sacrificing a piece in order for the H-pawn to penetrate the white forces.} 13. hxg4 {Probably the best attempt to keep white alive. If 13.Bxg4 Bxg4 14.hxg is similar to the game continuation.} hxg3 {! Spassky throw's another piece into the line of fire in order for his pawn to reach home. Unfortunately, Larsen analyses correctly and see's that 14.Rxh8 Rxh8 15.gxf is bad for white as Blacks domination of the H file will bring about a win. (Qh4 etc)} 14. Rg1 {This is a tricky move by Larsen as the deadly Qh4 can now be met with Rg2! when the black pawn is more of a hazard for black.} Rh1 {!! Great move by Spassky, already a piece for a pawn behind, he generously throws a rook into the heap in order for the g pawn to gain time.} 15. Rxh1 {Forced as Kf1? loses to Rxg1 Kxg1 and Qh4.} g2 {The reason for the rook sacrifice. The pawn has now gained momentum and cannot be stopped.} 16. Rf1 {Yes yes I can hear you right now "What about Rg1?" That was my first reaction to this move but it seems that Rg1 would lose even faster than this move. If 15. Rg1 then Qh4 ! 16.Kd1 Qh1! and white is lost as the pawn is unstoppable.} Qh4+ {The black queen finally makes her entrance onto the battlefield.} 17. Kd1 {Forced.} gxf1=Q+ {White resigns as 18.Bxf1 Bxg4  19.Kc1 Qe1 (19.Be2 Qh1 )   An excellent game by Spassky who shows how powerful a passed pawn can be in only 17 moves!}
