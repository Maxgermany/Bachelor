[Opening "Sicilian (B20), Gloria variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. c4 {Transforming it into an english-like opening. Weakeness the center though, which is oppossite to the idea of the sicilian closed variation; it also provides black with an extra move to arm his defenses, but sometimes I like to play this plan.} Nc6 3. Nc3 d6 4. d3 g6 5. g3 Bg7 6. Bg2 Nf6 7. Nge2 O-O 8. O-O Bg4 9. h3 {It seems to weaken the castling, but white´s only attack plan resides in moving his king´s flank against black´s castling.} Bd7 10. f4 Nh5 {Gives white a free move} 11. g4 Nf6 12. Be3 {Aiming for Black´s castling and also pinning c5. Maybe f5 was a stronger move, threatening 13.g5 in case of 12...e6.} e6 13. Qd2 Qc7 {Protecting b2 and also indirectly c5. Also 14.Ng3 with the idea of supporting the attack in f5 (15.f5) is not that good anymore considering now 15...d5.} 14. f5 exf5 15. gxf5 {Opening the g-column for the rook (in a future possibility). Maybe exf5 was better since it activates white´s bishop, but it did not seem clear to me.} a6 {Trying some sort of counterattack. Maybe Nh5 was stronger, but it is difficult to find a precise defense in such a blitz game} 16. Bh6 Ne5 17. Bxg7 Kxg7 18. Qg5 {Putting some pressure on f6. I knew I was giving up on d3, but it seemed to me there was compensation, although I had not a winning line at hand. I still can´t find it.} Qd8 {Not accepting the sacrifice but allows me to add the Ne2 to the attack while defending d3 at the same time. Still, h6 seemed better.} 19. Nf4 h6 20. Qg3 g5 21. Ncd5 {Spent most of my time thinking here what to do, and didn´t find anything better. I was eager to get a winning attack. 21. h4, Nh7 doesn´t seem to help me much.} Bc6 {Now this seemed to be the wrong one here in the game. Still 21...Nh7 looked good to me, with the idea of f6, closing the case.} 22. Nxf6 Kxf6 {Cannot be taken with queen, thus, black´s King is on the move for awhile} 23. Nh5+ Ke7 24. f6+ {Impeding f6 and also constricting black´s space. On the other hand, although N in h5 seems to be a good defender, holding that wing, it lacks attacking performance.} Kd7 25. Bf3 {Trying to activate my bishop. Maybe d4 with the idea of placing my rooks on the attack in d column was better. Nxf3 doesn´t seem to be a good option, since it will remove black´s active N.} Kc7 {Now it seems clear white needs to attack on the queen´s side. White´s N in h5 seems even less useful now, but white rooks are more appealing than those of black´s} 26. Bg4 {Maybe a waste of time, maybe not.} Bd7 27. a3 {Here we go. Black now needs to place his rooks on the defense, including that on f8 that seems to be extremely passive.} Qc8 {Threatening Bxg4 and gaining a pawn} 28. Bf5 Ng6 {Doesn´t seem to be the best defense, as mentioned, Black needs to prepare the defense on the queen side of the board.} 29. b4 b6 30. d4 {I was preparing this move (as mentioned previously) way ahead of this position, but now N in g6 makes it even easier.} Nf4 {Blocks white´s queen g3-d6 control and also opens g column for a counterattack. Also, after 31.Nxf4 gxf4; 32.Qxf4, Bxf5, white pawns in f column doesn´t seem to compensate that extra pawn. But In that case, I was thinking about: 33.d (or b)xc5! threatening mate in two (or else losing rook in f8 after white check on d6.} 31. Nxf4 gxf4 32. Qxf4 Rg8+ 33. Kh2 Bxf5 34. dxc5 {And so it went, although now rook cannot be taken. Still not sure if black can compensate after 34...Bd7 since white´s rooks seem to be extremely active. It would have been interesting to follow that line. In these few minutes of light analysis I can´t find a clear winning line, with, for example, 34...Bd7; 35.Qxd6+, Kd8 and careful now; there is always the possibility of ...Qb8 or Qc7 to exchange queens or even threatening mate. So, 36. Qe7+, Kc7; 37.cxb6+ Kxb6 cannot be continued with Qxf7 because of 38...Qc7+ and 39...Qg3 etc.} bxc5 {Opening the b-column. Now white´s attack cannot be stopped with Bd7} 35. bxc5 {Black surrenders.   I still have the feeling that white had a better attack before, but I couldn´t find a better line, so it is up to you guys to resolve the middle game resolution.}
