1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {I generally open like this.} d6 3. Nc3 Bg4 4. h3 {Does keep the pin? Or does he swap off? I would like to know your opinion.} Bh5 {He keeps the pin.} 5. g4 Bg6 6. h4 {I decide to chase him even further. It is clear tthat he doesn't want to go down a piece early.} h5 7. Bh3 {I like the look of this diagonal. I also think it may be a good idea to cover my king side after I have opened it up so much.} Nc6 8. d3 Nf6 9. g5 {I get on the front foot and try to put some pressure on.} Nd7 10. Be3 {I get my pieces out of the way so I can castle queen side. There is obviously no chance for me to safely castle king side.} Be7 11. Qe2 O-O 12. O-O-O {We both castle.} Nd4 {Why would he do that? I was curious when he played it.} 13. Nxd4 exd4 14. Bxd4 c5 {He may have sacrificed the pawn to get his queen out and about to attack my reasonably well-defended king.} 15. Be3 Ne5 16. f4 {Looks like there is going to be a big push on the king side.} Nc6 17. f5 Bh7 18. Rhf1 {This could get ugly for black.} Qb6 19. Qxh5 g6 {What do you think he should have done??? And do I have a better option than to swap?} 20. fxg6 Bxg6 21. Qh6 {I've got him right where I want him.} Nb4 22. h5 Bh7 23. g6 {The rooks will be swapped off now.} fxg6 24. Rxf8+ Rxf8 25. hxg6 {Here is the killer. What should black do? And should he have taken back with the bishop?} Rf6 26. Qxh7+ Kf8 27. Bh6+ {Time to get the bishop in on the action.} Ke8 28. g7 Rxh6 {This is as good as black resigning.} 29. Qxh6 c4 {Pointless.} 30. g8=Q+ {After this move black resigns. I have such a material advantage even if I play poorly from here, I'll win.}
