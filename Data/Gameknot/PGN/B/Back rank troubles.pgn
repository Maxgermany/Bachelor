1. e4 {This game was probably my very first game I ever started. I signed up and wanted to get right to it, and this game was available. But unlike my last annotation, I am playing black, I have played white in just about every game. } e5 {I still start with my classic opening move, e5.} 2. c4 {Transposing into the English Defense I see} Nf6 3. d3 Bb4+ {There are some games where I use my knights more and there are some games where I use my bishops more. I determine which one I will be using by getting rid of the other type.} 4. Bd2 Bxd2+ {Like that} 5. Nxd2 O-O 6. Ngf3 Nc6 7. Be2 d6 8. O-O Be6 9. b3 Ng4 10. h3 Nf6 {Maybe I did Ng4 just to waste a move. Nothing is really going on.} 11. Nh4 Nd4 12. Bh5 Nxh5 13. Qxh5 g6 {Nice try, but no rose garden over here!} 14. Qd1 Qxh4 15. f3 Rae8 16. Nb1 Qf4 17. Nd2 Qe3+ {I guess he didn't see that.} 18. Rf2 Ne2+ 19. Qxe2 Qd4 {Haha! } 20. f4 {Looks like he didn't see it!} Qxa1+ {The worst spot to have an enemy piece is on the back rank!} 21. Kh2 exf4 22. Nf1 Qe5 23. Qd2 {Aw, he saw the discovered attack. :(} f3+ 24. Ng3 fxg2 25. Kxg2 Bd7 26. d4 Qe6 {Charging the battery!} 27. d5 Qxh3+ {It puts out a lot of power!} 28. Kf3 Qg4+ 29. Kg2 Rxe4 {Taking advantage of the pin} 30. Rf3 {Hmmm, now I have no idea what I can do here.} Qh3+ {Oh, wait! The battery!} 31. Kf2 Qh2+ 32. Kf1 {I would have taken the queen, but now checkmate is unavoidable starting with Bh3} Bh3+ {Followed by Qg2 and I would respond with Qxg2#, which is why he resigned here.} 33. Qg2 Qxg2# {}
