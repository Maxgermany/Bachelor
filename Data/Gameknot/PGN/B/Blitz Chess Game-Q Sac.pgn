[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 {I am not surprised to see white play this.} e6 {Although it is very common, this is the first time that I have seen Joe play the French Defense in Blitz Chess.  The rest is pretty standard, but since he is black, TA sacs on f2.  You will note that f pawn right near the homesquare is it's weakest square on the chess board.  So, what I am alluding to, as I have no better way of explaining this is f2 for white and f7 for black.} 2. Be2 Qh4 3. d3 Qxf2+ 4. Kxf2 Bd6 {But, after the sac, TA goes back to development.  The idea is seeing if the opponent can beat him.  In general, it doesn't, but Joe does tests his opponent because the idea being is that with best play his opponent should win, so there's a bit to learn.  However, despite being a Q down with the pawn on the weakest square removed, so that is f2, there is little to no room for error.  So, if white makes mistakes, it would still be lights out for him, which as usual, is going to happen.} 5. h3 {Instead of advancing a flank, white should use the time to develop his pieces and get his K safety.  In fact, that is one of the things that Joe evaluates.  } Ne7 {But, Joe does not waist time in doing so.  In fact, in one of his lectures TA said that after sacking, he will just continue developing, for the most part.  And, what was implied is something that archduke_piccolo said that, if his opponent fails to do so, his pieces will be better coordinated which would be used for a devastating attack.  Not exactly sure how to explain, but the idea being is that pieces can work together to play a powerful role.  A perfect example was my last game against Ted where I had a powerful Bishop pair, despite still having 15 pawns left, which you don't see too often.  } 6. Bg5 {This, however, develops.  But, Joe has a plan with his next move.} f6 {The idea being that after white retreats, black will use that time to castle, whereas, white is forced to waist time by retreating which means that his DSB is forced to move twice.} 7. Bh4 O-O 8. c3 {I don't know why white played this.  But, in my opinion, he is now starting to run into trouble.  That's because with black's next move, he will have another piece out.  So, he will only have one piece undeveloped, whereas, white will have two.} Nbc6 9. Bg3 {?! I understand that white wants to exchange.  But, I don't see the point.  Not only is he moving the same piece again, as opposed to, developing another piece, but white's DSB is a good bishop, whereas, black's is a bad bishop, as Joe's DSB cannot retreat to the 7th rank.  That's because it's blocked by his c pawn and N on e7.} f5 {In this position, Joe's plan is to get a passed pawn by exchanging pawns on the f file.  As right now, there is no passer due to white's pawn on e4, but if they exchange, there white won't have a pawn next to black's pawn.  So, things will change.} 10. Bxd6 {For the reason mentioned earlier, which is that white gives up his good DSB, for black's DSB I wouldn't have played.  I also would not take on f5 because black would have a passed pawn, as noted a move ago.  Instead, I would've played 10.d4 which will give black more time, and as we know, tempo is very important.  So, for example, 10.d4, e4 (to prevent 11.e4, as white would lose a piece as his DSB is locked in) 11.d5, and now, Joe would be to forced to protect his N with whites pawn chain. } fxe4+ {Instead of taking back right away, he takes and gets a nasty discover check, in return.  I like this better as he does compensate first.  And, although white has a noticeable, I think it's fading away.  That's because we're not just looking at compensation, but now, white's K is starting to become exposed.  } 11. Kg3 {One of the reasons I said that is because of what black is going to play next.} Nf5+ 12. Kh2 {First, black will exchange and get a piece back.  But, suppose that weren't so, Joe now has a better structure.  So, while material wise, white has the edge, I think that, in general, it's even.  When I say that, what's important to note is that you don't base things solely on material.  For example, just because it's even (so the score is 0 doesn't mean it's a draw.)  And, being a pawn or two up doesn't=a win.  For instance, there was another game where material wise, it was even, but one side had a forced win, regardless.  And, resignation from the other wasn't premature, as there was an inevitable mating, in that position.} Nxd6 13. dxe4 Nxe4 14. Nf3 {At last, white develops another piece.  But, with what happened, it can't be concluded, but I'm afraid it's already too little, too late, as despite only having one piece undeveloped, black has much more control of the center then his opponent.  In addition, with that being said, Joe is going to get, in addition to, what he's compensated for, a R for N with a nasty fork. And I think that it is due to his control of the center.} Nf2 15. Qd2 Nxh1 16. Kxh1 d6 {That is proven here, as now, not only has he developed a center pawn; but even with the bad B, he can still bring it to d7.  And, if, ever ...e5, that would change into being a good B.} 17. Na3 {Completing development, but the problem is black's structure compared to his, which is still why I believe that it's too little, too late for white.  In other words, even though it's true, Joe maintains better control of the center.} a6 {To prevent the pesky 18.Nb5 or 18.Bb5} 18. Bd3 {Putting pressure on h6.  His idea is to get that h pawn and put black in a difficult situation.} Bd7 {But, Joe waists no time in completing development.  And, like I said earlier, despite being behind (material wise) I like black's position better.} 19. Ng5 {That threat becomes a little more obvious, however.} h6 {But, black stops it.  Now, I thought that white had alternatives, but the verdict is that he must run back.  I was thinking along the lines of 20.Bh7+, Kh8 as there appears to be pressure on black's K.  However, after black brings the K to h8, Joe would win another another piece.  So, white, obviously, makes the right choice.} 20. Nf3 Rf6 {At first, I wasn't sure why this was played, but now it makes perfect sense.  And, with that being said, I also would've moved here because Joe intends to and will double up, on his next move.} 21. Qc2 {Coming up with, what appears to be a threat on h7.  However, it is not, because, as we're about to see Joe will allow that.  The idea being is that doubling up is very useful and often known to give you and advantage.  As noted before, I won a Q early against Jack, but he was able to compensate due to a horrible mistake from me which allowed him to double up, similar to this.  The same thing happened when I coached a student, lost my Q early, but made a mistake that allowed me to double and get a passed pawn.  Those two things were what proved to be a killer.  With that being said, black now has the advantage because doubling up is known to be dangerous, and with a R missing from white, he won't be able to do it.  That gives black more dangerous threats against white, then one might think.} Raf8 22. Bh7+ Kh8 {Not to mention that Joe has placed his K in the corner.  And, remember the moral from my last annotation against Jack Stockel.  The lesson being that with nasty threats, or something like this, the K needs to be in the corner, as it's part of K safety because it prevents other nasty threats and gets you out of trouble.  With that being said, black is now safe, whereas, white has a bit to worry about.} 23. Nh4 {In this position, white intends to win a R for white's B with a double check followed by his remaining B for free, and if this happens, white would get the advantage.  In fact, while I can't conclude knowing what Joe teaches, I think it would be an easy win from then on.  The threat is, of course, 24.Ng6+, Kxh7 25.Nxf8+, Kg8 (because if 25...Kh8??, 26.Qh7#) 26.Nxd7 } Ne5 {! But, this is what I also would've played, as Joe stops the threat cold because if 24.Ng6+, 24...Nxg6, 25.Bxg6, and black doesn't lose anything else, as recapturing afterwards would be blunder since black would now get a R for B.} 24. Be4 {Seeing that it would be pointless to take, white turns his attention to b7 pawn as it is vulnerable.} Rf6f2 {So, as I see with GM games, as well as, ones from charleshiggie, Joe fights back by reattacking.} 25. Qb3 {But, b7 is what white still wants.} Rf2f4 {So, Joe answers with this move.  Given that white is in a nasty fork, I would not know what to do, in this position.  But, kavayah1 finds a way out of it, as this is ineffective.  And, I am not saying that black waisted time at all for this is quite good since it defends b7 since black has found a way out of trouble.  However, white finds a way out of it with his next move.  After which, the N's are exchanged, in which black will protect the b pawn, once and for all.} 26. Ng6+ Nxg6 27. Bxg6 b6 28. Nc2 {I am not sure why white played.  But, this time, it is safe to say it as I don't see a danger in a move I'm thinking about.  And, with that being said, I would've played 28.Nc4 which is a better outpost for his N.  The idea being is that it is, semi cramped on c2, meaning this is not a comfortable square for him.  And, after, say 28...d5, my next move would be 29.Ne5  If however, 28...b5, then I would answer with 29.Ne3} a5 {Getting a pawn chain, and black has a plan to go after white's Q, again, as we will see later on.} 29. Nd4 {This move, however, runs alongside what I had in mind when mentioning about 28.Nc4 as the N appears better placed.} Rf8f6 {Aside from just attacking something, I had no idea why Joe played this.  But, I realize that what he's really doing is achieving a semi open which is very useful.  I know this because TA has won a different a Q sac game, that I annotated, with an open file.} 30. Bc2 e5 {Going after white's N with the reason being to achieve another set of pawn chains.  It is worth noting that tactical-abyss also taught me about the importance of a pawn chain.  And although I have been corrected for getting them wrong, I now see the importance of that and where you really need them.} 31. Nf3 Bc6 {The idea is to win a pawn and mess up white's structures around the K because Joe has 32...Bxf3, 33.gxf3, Rxf3 in mind.} 32. Bd1 {Having said that, white needs the added protection.  Just bringing his R to f1 won't cut the mustard as his opponent has two R's on that file, which is a perfect example of where doubling up becomes dangerous.  And, that is also why I was able to conclude that Joe had the advantage, when 21...Raf8 was played.  In fact, as we're about to see towards the end of the annotation, black was already starting to get the initiative one the fourteenth (when tactical-abyss forked white's R+Q).} a4 {With all that being said, Joe goes right after white's Q with the idea being that he's accomplishing more open files.} 33. Qc2 e4 {This where black attacks again.  But, he does by adding an extra offender with his passed pawn which will also prove to be deadly.  In other words, both rooks on one file and the passer on e4 are both killers, and will force black's win which is not far away.} 34. Nd4 {Determined to get counterplay, white goes right after Joe's B.} Rf4f1+ {Unfortunately, it is of no use because of this move.  And, by no use, what I mean is that it's too late.  } 35. Kh2 Rf6f2 {Right after forcing white's K to h2, black takes advantage by, once again, attacking white Q.  That's because right after white retreats, Joe will push his passer one rank forward.  And, with that, white is going to lose very soon.  In fact, it is almost lights out for white.} 36. Qc1 e3 37. Qxe3 {?? White was trying to prevent a promotion, but Joe will mate immediately.  Unfortunately, as bad as, it is 37.Kg3 was a must.  No matter what, the white is busted, anyhow.  But, the game would continue with, 37.Kg3, e2 38.Bxe2 (no good would be 38.Nxe2 because black would still mate.  38...Rxg2+ 39.Kh4, g5+ 40.Kh5, Be8+ 41.Kxh6, Rf6#) 38...Rxc1 39.Rxc1, Bxg2  } Rxg2# {The moral of this story is what Joe notated.  In it, he said, ..."my opponents lack of central control on the board,his pawn structure wiped out in the middle and in particular move #14 where I already forked his Q and R...where he then lost his Rook already started his plunge into lava pit of the volcano with open arms!Once an opponents Rook is gone,and I have both my own Rooks(like in this game) the key is to seek out all semi and fully open files(like the f file near endgame),connect my Rooks and begin either ex-ray attacks or King attacks like move #34 of this game.Notice that after mate I still DID NOT gain the "full" point value loss of my Q back,but most of it.Count it up!Its a total of 24 points for white(my opponent) and only 19 points for me.But the value of my connected f file Rooks supersedes the value of his position,including his Queen.But to win,first being a Q down and then still winning being 5 points down in the endgame is a feat,if I do say so myself...and I am! Notice the attack on whites Queen on move #35,the poisoned pawn of mine on e4,his capture of that poison and then mate with my connected Rooks.I think his eye forgot about that protective Bishop on square c6.In summary,you will find a ton of my blitz games using this connected double Rook strategy!There is mega power when connected Rooks are allowed to roam free on open files.My opponent should never have allowed those files to be open...or at least protected them by creating a semi open file.Take a big note that my opponent made no use of his Rook on square a1.If your not going to make your big boys active in blitz,you might as well remove it from the board!"}
