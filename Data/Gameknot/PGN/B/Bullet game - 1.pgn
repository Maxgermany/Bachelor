[Opening "Sicilian (B22), Alapin's variation (2.c3)"]

1. e4 c5 {He played e4 and i responded with the Sicilian.} 2. c3 {Alapin variation. This leads to an equal position if black knows this variation which i did.} e6 {so i responded with e6.} 3. Nf3 {further prepearing d4} Nc6 {further controlling d4 square.} 4. d4 {and now after d4} d5 {i played d5. And we see what i have prepeared for Alapin variation. If you like sicilian but often run into 2.c3 this is a way of playing against it. there are of course other kind of setups black can play too.} 5. e5 {he decided to transpose this into some sort of a french defense. Fortunately i have experience playing the french as black.} Nge7 {Qb6 works here too. But my idea is developing the minor pieces more quckly. The point of this move is that now the knight can go to g6 or f5 (rather f5 and have a nice outpost over there).} 6. Bd3 {just prepearing to castle.} cxd4 {I'd like to remind you that i was playing with only 2 minutes on the clock and i decided therefor to take the pawn right now. I should have perhaps delayed it a move or so.} 7. O-O {0-0?! offering a gambit. In return he will develop his knight to c3 and there will be no d4 pawn to constantly defend.} Nf5 {my previous comment was what was running through my head at the moment. But perhaps i should have taken the pawn. His e-pawn isnt defended by an other pawn. A new target and i can play d4 at the right moment. But i had only 2 seconds to think and decided that he wants me to take on c3 so instead i played the knight to f5. f5 is a nice outpost for the knight because once he takes back on d4 the knight will give pressure on d4. This move also frees my BSB.} 8. Bxf5 {This looks very similar to a main line in the french defense Advanced variation. } exf5 9. cxd4 {He finally decided to take back the pawn.} Be6 {After Be6 this looks just like that main line in the advanced with white taking on f5 surrendering his bishop pair. This could be proven to be a long-termed weakness which i seek to exploit.} 10. Nc3 Be7 {Both players are developing. Im prepearing to castle.} 11. Be3 {I think the main line goes Bf4 instead. Im not sure though it was a while since i looked it up.} O-O 12. Nd2 {I was not sure what the point of this move was. Sure he had only 2 seconds to think but then play Rc1 or something else instead. i think the knight was well posted on f3.} Bg5 {the point is that i wanted to exchange my passive bishop for his active.} 13. f4 {but of course i over-looked f4.} Be7 {knocked me back with tempo. } 14. Kh1 {I was a bit frightened when i saw this move. it looks like he was going for a king-side pawn storm...} a6 {so that's why i played a6. i wanted to get some counter-play on the queenside.} 15. a4 {he saw my plan of playing b5 and prevented it. Of course this is what i want,that he plays on the queenside instead. } Rb8 {Supporting the b5 push.} 16. Rc1 {Just wanting to controll the c-file.} Nb4 {i had little time and couldnt think of a move so i decided to quickly play Nb4.} 17. Qe2 {The threat was Nd3. Not much of a threat but he still decided to prevent that. it knocks that rook of the c-file only.} b5 {a misscalculation. These happens to me in these quick games.} 18. axb5 axb5 19. Nxb5 {now we see that he won a pawn.} Qb6 {That let me of course play Qb6! and it turns out that i would have perhaps played b5 in a long timed game because i win back my pawn immideately. you see...} 20. Nc3 {after Nc3 retreating the piece black has...} Nc6 {Knight c6 attacking both the b-pawn and d-pawn.} 21. Rcb1 {the b-pawn is passed so he prefered defending it.} Nxd4 {won back my pawn.} 22. Bxd4 {once again doubious...} Qxd4 {...Now i get the whole bishop pair vs the knight pair. i just need to get my bishops in action.} 23. Qf2 {Another peculiar move. } Qxf2 {I was glad to go in to the endgame with a queen exchange. I have the bishop pair here.} 24. Rxf2 Rfc8 {bringing my other rook into the fight. It was not doing anuthing on f8 and this way it at least attacks the c-file.} 25. Rf3 {he saw that 25. ... Rxc3 and i win the knight.} Bb4 {Pinning the knight agains the knight and blocking the b-pawn.} 26. Rc1 {He obviously missed my next move.} d4 {d4! Now i win a piece. he says ''yes'' here. he was pleased with that i found this move (despite that i dont know him)} 27. Ne2 Rxc1+ 28. Nxc1 Bxd2 {Won the knight here,and attacking the other knight.} 29. Nd3 Be3 {I just wanted to put that bishop on a nice looking outpost.} 30. h3 {giving his king some air.} Rb3 {I found Rb3 taking advantage of that my bishop cuts off his pieces communication.} 31. Nc5 Rxb2 {won a pawn. but here he played a blunder.} 32. g4 {g4?? looses after...} Bd5 {And he resigned. So a nice bullet game here. it was fun,i had 25 seconds left and he had 7 seconds left.}
