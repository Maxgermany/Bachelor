1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. d4 Bb4 5. e3 c5 6. Bd2 O-O 7. a3 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 Ne4 9. Rc1 Nd7 10. cxd5 exd5 11. dxc5 Ndxc5 12. Bd4 Bg4 {Blunder simply giving away the N on c5. Correct was Ne6 } 13. Bxc5 Bxf3 14. gxf3 Nxc5 15. Rxc5 {Leaving black with an isolated central pawn and no developed pieces } Qe7 16. Rxd5 Rad8 17. Bg2 Rxd5 {When you are behind in material and development it is not a good idea to swap of pieces } 18. Qxd5 Rd8 19. Qe4 Qd7 {back rank mate threat which is easily avoided by 0-0 } 20. O-O Re8 21. Bh3 Qd8 22. Qxb7 Re7 {This constant harrying of the Q achieves only a further exchange of pieces } 23. Qc8 Qxc8 24. Bxc8 h6 25. Rc1 {Threatening Bf5 Rc8 mate } a5 26. b4 axb4 27. axb4 {Giving white a passed b-pawn } Re5 28. Bd7 Rg5+ 29. Kh1 Rd5 30. Rc8+ Kh7 31. Bc6 {Setting up the shield which will allow the b-pawn to Q } Rd6 {Probaly the worst place to put the R. Now it cannot even get to a position to sac itself for the new Q } 32. b5 h5 {Aseeming pointless move but one which could catch the unaware out } 33. b6 h4 34. b7 h3 {Now if white gets tunnel vision on the Q promotion it would be possible to miss the back rank mate Rd1 } 35. Rh8+ {The R is safe as if KxR then b8=Q+ and the R is lost } Kg6 36. Be4+ {At this poi nt black asked if i was toying with him. But no i still had to stop Rd1 } f5 37. Bc2 Rd2 38. b8=Q Rxc2 39. Qd6+ Kf7 40. Rf8# {The lesson from this game is keep an eye on the whole board or you may miss something important. }
