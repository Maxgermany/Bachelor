1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4 {Normal is 5...Bxc3  6. bxc3 Qc7 7. Qg4!? Ne7! 8. Qxg7 Rg8 when, if White is greedy and takes the h-pawn, he gets in more trouble than if he plays 9. Qh6 followed by 10. Qe3, but I tend to be greedy!  7...f5 is also quite a good response to 7. Qg4.  Either way, Black gets a very strong attack and both sides tend to forego castling.  If White plays well, he gets good counter-chances.  I've just resigned a team game against robbyzzz where I lost this line...} 6. axb4 dxc3 7. bxc3 Nc6 8. f4 Nge7 9. Nf3 {giving up my chance of a quick counter-attack with my Q but counting on a more solid position to give me winning chances.} Qb6 {! necessitating elaborate preparations before I can castle.  I'd like to block the Q's view down the a7-g1 diagonal with my B but first I have to protect e3 with my Q.  To do this without interfering with my other B, I must first develop the KB then move my Q to e2.  Developing the KB to d3 also ensures that a black N coming to f5 to attack e3 can be swapped off, giving Black doubled pawns to match White's own.} 10. Bd3 h6 {seems to be a waiting move, preventing White from playing Ng5 and attacking the h7 pawn, not that I planned such a thing but perhaps my 10th move had made him think I did.} 11. Qe2 O-O 12. Be3 Qc7 {By now I was about 12 minutes ahead on the clock but Black was clearly expecting this and moved quickly.} 13. O-O {objective achieved... now I started to consider how I could attack Black's very sound-looking position, disrupt his position and sort out my awful pawns on the Q-side.} Bd7 14. Bc5 {!? Not sure it quite deserves a full !; but I like this move as it defends the b4 pawn so that I can advance the c-pawns.  It also pins the Ne7 against Black's Rf8 and threatens to occupy a great outpost on d6, attacking Black's Q at the same time.  I was hoping that Black would try to chase off the B with 14... b6, depriving his Q of a great square, but he didn't fall for that ...} a6 {?! not sure this achieves anything} 15. c4 dxc4 16. Bxc4 {I've succeeded in swapping off my doubled pawn but the other c-pawn still looks a bit sick} Rfe8 {relieving the pin and freeing both Ns for action.} 17. Nd4 {?! This didn't work out very well, however superficially attractive it may be.  It looks attacking but actually just allows Black to relieve the pressure.} Nxd4 18. Bxd4 Nf5 19. Bf2 Rac8 20. Bd3 {Black has established his N on a good outpost and set up a powerful battery down the c-file.  White has gone backwards and still has worries about his pawns.} Red8 21. c4 {Turning my liability into an asset. I think we were level on the clock now.} Bc6 22. Bxf5 {getting rid of the irksome N and giving Black doubled pawns} exf5 23. Rfd1 Be4 {an impregnable outpost for Black's B} 24. c5 {Now my pawns look much better, but can I capitalise on them?} Qc6 {The attack on the long white diagonal is very annoying.  First I have to defend g2 but in the future I also have to prevent ..Bg2-h3 or Bg2-h1 followed by Qg2  } 25. Be3 Rxd1+ 26. Rxd1 {Not 26. Qxd1?? Bxg2} Qa4 27. Qe1 {Now the Q can move off the second rank, so she defends both the Rd1 and the Pb4 at the same time.} Rc6 28. Rd6 {Inviting a swap that would be very favourable to me.  Naturally Black declines...} Qc2 {attacking g2 from another angle.  Now the threat is mate in one.} 29. Bd2 a5 {an unpleasant diversionary tactic that threatens to become a powerful passed pawn if I don't take it.  But if I take immediately, I was worried by 30. bxa5 Qxc5  ...In the cold light of day 31. Be3 seems an adequate response, so perhaps I didn't need to swap rooks after all} 30. Rxc6 Bxc6 31. bxa5 Qxc5+ 32. Be3 Qd5 33. Qd2 Qe4 34. Qf2 Bb5 35. h3 Qb4 36. Bd2 {and I offered a draw which Paul quickly accepted.  I didn't think either of us had an edge here.}
