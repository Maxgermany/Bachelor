[Opening "French (C02), advance, Paulsen attack"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {Here playing white on a french defense, advance variation. The winnawer (Nf3) is generally used but I don't like that much this line because of bad experiences. It's a blitz game by the way.} c5 {Black try to pierce my middle pawns and enter the bishop.} 4. c3 {It block the queen side but I don't care because I want to play on the king side. I want to keep a strong middle.} Nc6 5. Nf3 {It block my queen to g4 but it's a natural defensive move.} cxd4 {There was no hurry to exchange but it's fine. } 6. cxd4 Nge7 7. Nc3 Qb6 8. Rb1 {! The idea is to be able to protect b2 if I have to move my bishop and maybe to advance it later.} Nf5 9. Be3 {Most of the time it's better to keep the bishop vs a knight but I though it could give me the opportunity to attack on the king side later.} Bb4 10. Be2 Qa5 {?! Well I think it's a waste of tempo, but still playable. The king make pressure on both c3 and a2.} 11. Qb3 {The best way to protect both. I like the idea that my queen or my rook to pierce into b7 later if black move both his bishops.} O-O 12. O-O Nxe3 13. fxe3 Bxc3 {?! I think Be7 would have been better in this situation.} 14. bxc3 {I really like my position. Strong middle and great opportunities to attack on the king side.} a6 {Well I prefer Nf7. Black think about to continue with b5 but underestimate an attack on the king side.} 15. Qc2 h6 {To prevent Ng5 and Qxh7.} 16. Bd3 {?! Not very sure about this move. The idea was to do Bh7+ so the king don't hide on the queen side. Maybe a direct g4 would have been better.} Ne7 17. g4 {! Prevent an immediate Nf5 and help to contribute to the attack on the king side. There is no immediate threat from black on the king side. His rook and and bishop is still undeveloped and there is a blockade in the middle.} Qd8 18. Bh7+ {?! Really not sure about this sacrifice. It was purely instinctive but I think a direct g5 would have been more precise.} Kh8 19. g5 g6 20. gxh6 Nf5 {!} 21. Bxg6 {This bishop was lost anyway. This way, I break his defense and get a pawn.} fxg6 22. Rbe1 {I took some minutes to think about the right way to go. Black is winning with perfect defense but there is still a lot of tricks to play.} Kh7 {? Well I don't like this move. Waste of tempo and now the king can be directly threaten by Ng5. I prefer Bd7 to be able to do Be8 and protecting the g pawn.} 23. Qg2 Rg8 {?? Worst possible move. } 24. Ng5+ {Black must lose the queen now. If Kxh6 or Kh8 then Nf7 doing a royal fork.} Qxg5 25. Qxg5 Bd7 {Now I have a great advantage.} 26. Kh1 {Thinking about to do Rxf5 gxf5 Qe7+ to take the bishop. The king must move so my queen don't get pinned by the rook.} Rae8 {Black see it and defend.} 27. Reb1 {The time on my clock is getting very low, less than 1 minute to play.} Bb5 28. Rf3 {Ready to do Rh3 if Nxh6 and protecting the e pawn.} Bc6 29. Rg1 Ref8 30. h4 {! If Nxh6 then Rxf8 Rxf8 and Qxg6+. } Rf7 {? After Be8, black seems almost in zugzwang.} 31. h5 {The end is near.} Be8 32. hxg6+ Kh8 33. g7+ {gxf7 would have been fine too. 33.gxf7 Rxg5 fxe8+(queen promotion) or 33.gxf7 Bxf7 34.Qf6+ Kh7 Qxf7+} Nxg7 {Rfxg7 34.hxg7+ Rxg7 35.Rh3+} 34. Rxf7 Bxf7 35. hxg7+ {Kh7 Qh4+} Rxg7 36. Qxg7# {Great game even if I have almost lost!}
