1. e4 {Hi everyone - here is the second of a double bill for you - yet again Glenda will have the final say.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nf6 {3. .......... Nf6 - fairly standard Hanham Phildor moves.} 4. Nc3 Qe7 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. Bc4 g6 {6.  ............. g6 - preparing Bg7 but black does not complete the fianchetto.  I continue developing at a very rapid pace.  Here my development is about to stall until my last move of the game because black's game is about to explode!  Wait for it .......} 7. Bg5 {7. Bg5 -  ............ wait for it .............} Nc6 {7. ................ Nc6?? which allows ............ wait for it .........} 8. Nd5 {8. Nd5!! - NOW!!!  This move wins at least a piece, in fact it is about to net much, much more.} Qd7 {8. ............ Qd7?? - Allows a devastating knight fork but black is already up the creek.} 9. Nxf6+ Ke7 10. Nxd7+ Ke8 11. Nf6+ Ke7 12. Nd5+ Kd7 {12. ............ Kd7.  This does allow a nasty double check netting the black rook on a8, but here comes something better, something much much better!} 13. Nxe5+ {13. Nxe5 !! - This stunning sacrifice forces mate in I think all variations.   These variations are as follows.   Variation A 13. Nxe5  Ke8  14. Nf6  Ke7  15. Nxc6  bxc6  16. Ng4  f6  17. Bxf6  Ke8  18. Qd8#   Variation B 12. Nd5  Kd7  13. Nxe5  Nxe5  14. Nb6  Kc6  15. Qd5  Kxb6  16. Qb5#   Variation C 13. Nxe5  Ke6  14. Nxc7  Kxe5  15. Qd5#   Variation D 13. Nxe5  Kd6  14. Nc3  Kxe5  15. Qd5#   Variation E 13. Nxe5  Kd6  14. Nc3  Kc5  15. Qd5  Kb4  16. a3#   I now set up some conditional moves. } Nxe5 14. Nb6+ Ke8 {14. ............ Ke8 - white shortens Variation B and now I deliver mate on d8.  This is just surreal.} 15. Qd8# {}
