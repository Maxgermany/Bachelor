1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 {...looking for a typical Najdorf...pet opening i'm trying to absorb...Can you ever learn it all ??!!!} 3. Bc4 e6 4. Nc3 g6 5. d4 cxd4 6. Qxd4 {...white is distinctly ahead in development...and my structure is going to get a bit loose....} f6 7. O-O Nc6 {...at last some piece into play...but white is well ahead still...} 8. Qd3 Bg7 9. Re1 a6 {...alot of pawn moves early but this one is going to gain a temp later with b5. need to scoot to 0-0 asap !!} 10. a3 {..this wastes a tempo i thought. Be3 might have been better and connect the rooks, also preventing Qb6} Nh6 {...aiming for f7 and 0-0, white should chop here and i expected this...but...} 11. h3 {..another wasted tempo...black is now edging to a solid position...not good for white in a Sicilian...(to my limited knowledge ! )} Nf7 12. b4 b5 13. Bb3 Qe7 {..get out of the firing line...expecting a rook to come to d1 in the very near future....} 14. a4 {..mistake i thought...i'll take the pawn though..!} Nxb4 15. Qd4 Nc6 16. Qb6 Nfd8 17. axb5 {..white has threats but its bye bye Queen for the mo..} Rb8 18. Qe3 axb5 19. Bb2 O-O {..at last...} 20. Rad1 {..now i did say something about Rd1...} b4 21. Na4 Nf7 {...need to shore up d6 first...} 22. Nb6 {...a neat little trap is being set here if not spotted...could be a Queen for 2 bishops if Ra1 after this move...} Ba6 23. c3 {...and white did not spot the sneaky little move....Bh6 ! Winning a piece and pawn for nothing...} Bh6 {...so missus....is that your Nb6 hanging...?} 24. Ng5 Bxg5 25. f4 {...earlier white had to get the Nf3 to d2, to avoid this trap...} Bxf4 {...so whites Queen, Knight and pawn & then 2 bishops(Rxb6 & bxc3) are now under real threat  within 2 moves...nicely done...} 26. Qxf4 Rxb6 27. cxb4 Rxb4 {...black is about to win another piece should white think of Bxf6.....} 28. Bxf6 Qa7+ {..check it out ....! Now winning the piece with Qe3 (forced) and Rxc3} 29. Qe3 Rxb3 30. Qxa7 Nxa7 31. Be7 {...i can let black take the rook and have less pieces to deal with...also, if Bxd6, Rd8 follows.} Nc6 32. Bxf8 Kxf8 {..thanks...} 33. h4 Nce5 34. Rda1 Rb6 {..keep it solid for the moment until....} 35. Kf2 {..an unexpected gaff...probably rushed...as now....its curtains....} Nd3+ {...white is 2 pieces and a pawn down...so tis time to go...!! A good game, white started very well...and might have pressed home a better advantage (a3 & h3 were costly in giving me a tempo or 2...)}
