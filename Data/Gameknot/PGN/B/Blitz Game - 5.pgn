[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Scandinavian variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 {A little unusual, but invites white to overextend.} 2. Nc3 e5 3. f4 {!? A fun little transposition to the Vienna Gambit.} exf4 {?! Taking the pawn is not advisable in the Vienna Gambit, because of the vulnerability of the knight on f6 and the lack of the threat Qh4+.} 4. e5 Ng8 {Slightly preferable is Qe7, but Ng8 opens the d8-h4 diagonal for the queen.} 5. Nf3 {Stops the check on h4.} f6 {Black needs to start developing, and this isn't much help. This attempts to entice 6. exf6 Nxf6, but white has other ideas.} 6. d4 {Natural and strong. White may be down in material but the lines of attack are wide open.} g5 {Trying to hang on to all his material, black again fails to focus on development.} 7. Bc4 {Many moves look good here; it's hard to go wrong with bringing another piece into the fray.} Nc6 {Finally, a little development!} 8. O-O g4 {There aren't many good squares for the knight, but can black afford to go after material?} 9. Bxf4 {!? Sacrificing the knight for an overwhelming developmental lead.} gxf3 {Pretty much forced, or all the kingside pawn moves were for naught. But still not good.} 10. Qxf3 {Okay, let's take stock here. Black's kingside is a mess, his only developed piece is the Nc6, and all he's got to show for it is a slight edge in material. White has five active pieces and a clear target: the black king.  Does black even have a prayer here?} Nxd4 {? Pretty much equivalent to giving up, but it's hard to find a better move. White's response is a killer.} 11. Qd5 {Threatening mate on f7 and to win back all the sacrificed material with a huge positional advantage. Black is busted, but Qh5+ would have been even stronger, forcing Ke7 and mate next. You can't expect to see it all with just 5 minutes per game.} Nxc2 {Giving up, but neither Ne2+, Nh6 nor Qe7 -- the only ways to prolong the game -- offer much better.} 12. Qf7# {A fun little miniature. No wonder they don't play with me at work very often. :-(}
