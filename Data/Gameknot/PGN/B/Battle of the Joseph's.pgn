1. e4 {Breeze through the setup and watch the action start happening around move 10.} Nf6 2. Nc3 d6 3. d4 g6 4. Be3 Bg7 5. Qd2 Ng4 6. Bg5 O-O 7. O-O-O a6 8. Nd5 Nf6 9. Bc4 b5 {when threatened consider an additional attack.} 10. e5 Nxd5 11. Bxd5 c6 {Here. Ignoring the attack on the bishop and focusing on applying pressure to e7. } 12. Re1 cxd5 13. exd6 {Now black must dispose of the pawn or a potential fork or promotion can take place...} Qxd6 {...but taking the pawn forks queen and rook.} 14. Bxe7 Qb6 15. Bxf8 {If black responds taking the bishop with the king it'll just seal the deal...} Kxf8 16. Qb4+ {Black resigns knowing that next is  16. ... Kg8 17. Re8+ Bf8 for the block 18. Qxf8#  I think my improvement in this game was 12. Re1. I'm still not sure how I figured that out. Reviewing the game I was surprised when I saw what I had done. It's definitely encouraged me to think more unorthodox.}
