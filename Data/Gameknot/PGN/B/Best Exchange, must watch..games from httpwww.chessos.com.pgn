1. e4 {All notes by Rakshi } c5 {Sicilliance defence, at the GM level most contrubuted opening } 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 {4..Nf6 is good } 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. Bd3 e5 7. O-O Nf6 8. Nc3 Be7 9. Ne2 {9. Be3 is not so well, white thinks to place his Knight on attackable 'g' file } O-O 10. Ng3 Be6 {10..d5 also better } 11. f4 {good move, now black's 'e' pawn forces to capture } Qb6+ 12. Kh1 exf4 13. Rxf4 Rae8 {this is mistake, because his Rook on f8 and Bishop on e7 fully blocked, 13..d5 is playable to breakout white's development } 14. Nh5 {fine move } h6 {this not a playable move he have to play 14.. Nxh5 } 15. Nxf6+ Bxf6 16. Rxf6 {is it quiet better to exchange a Rook for a Bishop?? It is good move. white thinks to open black's 'g' file for attacking } gxf6 17. Qh5 {why not 17. Bxh6? It can't make better attack. so 17.Qh5 is good to attack } Bc8 {black's idea to place his Rook on e5 but 17..Rb8  looks better } 18. Qxh6 {can't 18. Bxh6? 18..Re5 stronger for Black } Qd4 19. Be3 {it is just for moving his Rook on f1 } Qxb2 20. Rf1 Re6 21. Bc4 Qe5 {he can't move Rook from e5, if ..Re8 or Re5 22. Qg6+ Kh8 23. Qxf6+ Kh7 24. Bxf7 or Bh6 most stronger } 22. Bxe6 fxe6 {if 22..Bxe6 23. Rf3 Bg4 24. Rg3 Qa1+ 25. Bg1 } 23. Qg6+ Kh8 24. Rf4 {Black Resigns }
