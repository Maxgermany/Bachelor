1. e4 {This is a blitz game vs. pogo.com's Master Level CPU (2000  supposedly) program. SO either Black couldn't cope with the barrage of unrelated moves or computers are getting soft.} Nf6 {Alekhine's defence} 2. Nf3 Nxe4 {A pawn for rapid development.} 3. Nc3 d5 {The GK game database doesn't exceed here past move 3.} 4. d3 {So from here on we're out of white's known opening book.} Nc5 5. Be3 d4 {a pseudo-fork perhaps feeling that giving the pawn back will help balance out for lack of development} 6. Bxd4 Ne6 {attacking while retreating, but blocking in the e7 pawn.} 7. Be5 Nc6 8. Bg3 Nb4 9. a3 {a wasted tempo unless drawing out wing pawns is apart of it's plan.} Nc6 10. Be2 Nc5 11. O-O Bg4 12. h3 Bh5 13. Nb5 {Double attack on c7} Bxf3 14. Bxf3 Na5 15. Nxc7+ Kd7 16. Bg4+ e6 17. b4 {White is too hasty, as the 17.Nxa8 should have come before the b4 fork.} Rc8 18. bxc5 {Capturing the better positioned knight} Bxc5 {18....Bxc5? Perhaps black felt the solid pawn, bishop development, & f2 pin was worth more than the added value of Whites knight & Black-squared bishop for a rook. } 19. Nb5 Qg5 {Threating Bxf2 , Qxb4.} 20. d4 Bb6 21. Nd6 Rcg8 {Blocking in the other bishop, black limits it own powers even more.} 22. Nxf7 Qb5 23. Rb1 {NOT 23.Nxh8 as White doesn't want to trade an active knight for blacks inactive rook as that would only help black, perhaps black's 21st move assumed the fork was to win the h8 rook.} Nb3 {23. Nb3?? Black must have forseen a greater threat if the queen had retreated otherwise this move is an outright blunder.} 24. Rxb3 Qa6 25. d5 Ke7 26. Bxe6 Bxf2+ {26...Bxf2 ?? Sacraficing the bishop for what? temporary relief of dark-squared pressure on the king? Another blunder unless...} 27. Bxf2 Kf8 28. Qf3 Ke7 29. Bc5+ Ke8 30. Nd6+ Kd8 31. Qf7 {mate in 1.} Qxf1+ {...Unless 27...Bxf2?? was in preperation for this desperate last attempt at pinning the queen, that almost worked, but black is down too much material for it to have a made difference.} 32. Qxf1 Rgf8 33. Qb5 {mate in 1.} Rf1+ 34. Qxf1 Rg8 35. Qf7 {mate in 1.} Rf8 36. Qd7# {And resign is niether in a CPU's vocabulary nor programmed as a valid option living up to the adage that "no ones ever won by resigning."}
