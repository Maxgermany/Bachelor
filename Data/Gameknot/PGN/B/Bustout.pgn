[Opening "Dunst (Sleipner, Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"]

1. Nc3 {Mr Kitrich had tired of the English and played this hypermodern variation instead.} d5 2. b3 {Mr. Kitrich supposes that he can call this opening the 'Queen's Indian Defense'.} e5 {We are set for the classic hypermodern challenge; will white be able to undermine black's control of the center with peripheral pieces?} 3. e3 Nc6 4. Bb5 {Is Mr. Kitrich prepared to relinquish his light-squared bishop, given the likely weakness of d3?} Nge7 5. d4 {Kitrich plays a thematic break, inviting black to either unzip the E-file, which both players can then share, or to close the board with e4.  My question: is e4 good for black...?} e4 {E4 it is.  We are getting a sense of the game now.  With the center closed white's dark-squared bishop looks to be boxed in after Bc2 -- the only viable move for the piece.  F3 will be a thematic break that will have to be played at the correct time.  White now also has the possibility of Nge2 followed by Nf4.} 6. Nge2 a6 7. Bxc6+ {This move seems reasonable given the fact that we are faced with a closed board.  In fact, the move is forced, as the bishop has no retreat.} Nxc6 {The position looks quite even.  How will white drum up an attack given the solid nature of the position..?} 8. Bb2 {An unaesthetic move.} Bb4 {Indeed.  With this move, black appears to be taking control of the game.} 9. O-O Bg4 {Black continues to deploy his bishops aggressively, finding open diagonals.  White looks passive here.  } 10. h3 Bxe2 {This exchange does not surprise, given the closed nature of the position, in which knights are likely to be handier than bishops.} 11. Qxe2 {Was Nxe2 superior here?  Where is the white knight going now that the e2 pivot is gone?} Bxc3 12. Bxc3 {In this middle game, blacks knight could well prove a superior piece to the embarrassingly cloistered dark-squared bishop.  Nonetheless, there are ideas of an eventual C4 break.} b5 13. f3 {Instead of Bb2 and C4, attempting to play on the queenside, white plays the critical f3 break.  The question is: was this the right moment for the f3 break?} b4 {Black plays an intermediate move here, suggesting that he may be confused, or having difficulty calculating the exf implications.  Can white maintain some sort of psychological edge..?} 14. Bb2 f5 {The idea appears to be to support e4.  But is black's commitment to holding e4 tenable?  Namely, will black overextend himself by this commitment to e4?  And can white unzip the f-file, and perhaps develop an aggressive kingside attack?} 15. fxe4 fxe4 {So the f-file is unzipped.  One obvious implication is that 0-0 is prevented.  However, white's problem bishop looks like a wasted piece.} 16. Qh5+ {A rather cheeky move from Mr. Kitrich.  The time control was short, and Kitrich wanted to maintain the psychological edge he had attained after the tentative b4.  } g6 17. Qh6 {Black is prevented from castling.  On the other hand, Ne7 to Nf5 looks like it would solve the problem if it can be played in time.} Ne7 18. Rf7 {Rf7??!!  At this point, white's balls are hanging out of his trousers.} Kxf7 {Black accepts the sacrifice.  What can white possible press?} 19. Rf1+ {Fair enough but black surely can defend this, and work his way to a winning endgame, can he not?} Nf5 {Not the best move.  G4 would appear to be the immediate threat.} 20. Qf4 {Why does white play this mysterious move instead of an immediate G4?  Surely G4 was stronger here..?} Rf8 {Black appears to be confused as to whether he should defend or attack.} 21. g4 Ke6 {A critical position, with the knight now unpinned.} 22. Qe5+ Kd7 {Surely black has wriggled out of the danger zone.} 23. gxf5 Rxf5 24. Rxf5 gxf5 {White is now working with essentially one piece.} 25. Qxd5+ Ke8 26. Qe6+ {A classy move.  After Qxd5, df is suddenly possible.  If white can get D5 in, the bishop will have finally busted out.} Qe7 27. Qg8+ Qf8 28. Qe6+ Kd8 29. d5 {There it is.  With the threat of Bf6+, can black defend this?} c5 {No!  The bishop has busted out.} 30. Bf6+ Kc7 {The bishop may have busted out, but it's not over yet.} 31. Be5+ Kb7 32. Qd7+ {Notice how the sequence of checks forces the black king up the queenside.} Kb6 33. Qc7+ Kb5 34. Qc6+ Ka5 35. Bc7# {And there it is : A beautiful mate from a piece that had to wait 30 moves to get into the game.}
