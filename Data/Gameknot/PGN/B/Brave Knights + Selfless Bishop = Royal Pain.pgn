1. e4 {This game's only fine attribute is that it shows how an inaccurate opening can be punished severely.  The quality of the game is not high, but it does contain an entertaining minor piece attack.} g6 {Black goes with the modern defense.} 2. d4 {Not having faced this move before I opted for quick control of the center.} d6 3. Nf3 {Continuing development and protecting d4 against the inevitable Bg7} Bg7 {Yep.} 4. Nc3 {Further dominating the center.} Nd7 {? This move blocks Black's white squared bishop.  Pinning the white knight on f3 looks better.} 5. Bc4 b6 {Preparing to fianchetto the other bishop.  It is true the bishop needs to get into play but Black is taking way too much time to get developed} 6. Ng5 {Brave Knight number 1 prepares to attack the weak f7.  (The pawn of f7 cannot be moved because of 7. Ne6 winning the Black queen.)} e6 {The best Black had but..} 7. Bxe6 {! The Selfless Bishop offers to sacrifice himself.} Nh6 8. Bxf7+ {The bishop insists on sacrificing himself.  Martyrdom for eternal paradise?} Nxf7 9. Ne6 {The Knight sets his sights on the Black queen.} Qf6 {Trying to protect the poor bishop on g7} 10. Nd5 {?/!  This is a bit of a gamble with Qxe6 available} Qh4 {?? This costs black the game.  Qxe6 would have resulted in black being three points down, but still having play with six pieces (three developed) to white's four (zero developed).} 11. Nxg7+ {What true knight could resist plundering a rich bishop?} Kf8 12. Ne6+ {Preparing to go after the rook on a8 as soon as the king returns to e8.} Kg8 {?! losing the rook was preferable to ..} 13. Qg4 {!! losing the queen. If the Black queen leaves the d8-h4 diagonal then Ne7# , any other move loses the queen for a knight.}
