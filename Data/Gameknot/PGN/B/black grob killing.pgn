1. e4 g5 {black reversed grob...} 2. d4 h6 3. h3 {this is a lost tempo, there no interest in playing h3 at this time.} Bg7 4. Nf3 {NOT GOOD !  first : the danger is g5 g4, instead of the pawn in h3, second : it is not necessary to protect  h4 for the moment white play denfensively, they should attack !  } c5 {i did} 5. dxc5 {ho ho ho, the gambit is accepted ! so what was the reason to put this knight in f3 ??? I now think that opoent is perturbed by grob...} Qa5+ {let's take back my pawns !} 6. Nc3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 Qxc3+ {first...} 8. Bd2 Qxc5 {second !} 9. Bd3 {preparing castle ...} Nc6 {preparing attack ! This is the grob philosophy.} 10. Be3 Qa5+ 11. Qd2 Nb4 {now i feal the fear : this is very risky. I play it to quickly whithout thinking, just intution ... knight take c2, king has to go, then  i exchange queens and win the a rook...} 12. O-O {so now the problem is coming, i'm nailed !} g4 {this was just searching to win time a maybe to make an oportunity to get out of this stupid trap i put my self } 13. hxg4 h5 {you see the oportunity ?... if g4 x h5, then qxh5 and mat is coming if not, h5 x g4 and then i exchange the knights... well, i hope !} 14. a3 hxg4 {this is my plan but it seems to be better instead !  lets forget the b4 knight and put my queen in h5 !} 15. Nd4 Qh5 {so ? ... yes, it'mat anyway !  In my opinion, this is a perfect exemple of what kind of good games occurs whith grob}
