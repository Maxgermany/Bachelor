1. e4 {Back one for intro "<"} c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qe7 {This game is currently the only game in the GameKnot database sporting the Sicilian Taimanov Variation with 5. ... Qe7.  On the surface, this move looks a little questionable as it is pretty early for a queen move and blocks development of the dark squared bishop.  However, the story behind this move is kind of interesting.  In the previous game between us, I, while doing opening study using the GameKnot database stumbled across a game itking had lost to another player after being forced to move his bishop off of the h7-b1 diagonal to retake a rook on move 24.  Looking at the game, I realized that the other available move would allow a winning exchange sacrifice.  So I played the game for that line, made the exchange sacrifice, and won.  Itking must have realized that I had seen that game, so this time he took an early opportunity of getting away from any database lines.} 6. Be3 {I continued with reasonable development hoping to prove that I am a worthy opponent in my own right as well.} Nf6 7. Qd2 Nxd4 8. Bxd4 e5 9. Be3 Qe6 10. Be2 Bb4 11. a3 {11. a3??  This move loses a pawn, stacks another, and isolates the a and c pawns.} Nxe4 {11. ... Nxe4  Attacks the queen and leaves me in a world of hurt.} 12. Qd3 Bxc3+ 13. bxc3 d5 {At this point I recognized that against such a superior opponent the game could well be over.  My only strong points are the bishop pair and a slight lead in development.  As I worked analysis to find a way to use these to my advantage, I found ...} 14. c4 {14. c4!?} Qg6 {14. ... Qg6?  I give this move a ? because 14. ... d4 (followed by 15. Qxe4 dxe3 Qxe3) looks like a much stronger move giving back the pawn, but taking away the bishop pair and most of the initiative from white.} 15. Qxd5 {15. Qxd5  This move looks unnatural since white had the chance to unstack his pawns and create a passer, but with the immediate threat of Qxe5  and 16. Bd3 in the works this seems preferable to cxd5 to me.  Comments?} O-O 16. Bd3 {Pinning and threatening to win the black knight.} Bf5 17. Qxe5 {Keeping the knight pinned with the plan to push f3 in the near future.} Rfe8 {Black gains the initiative!} 18. Qf4 Qxg2 19. O-O-O Qh3 20. f3 {20. f3  This allows the ensuing royal fork threat, but with an entirely compromised pawn structure I felt I must keep the initiative to have a chance.  Perhaps Kb2 was better.  Thoughts?} Nc3 21. Rde1 {White must defend against the royal fork} Bxd3 {Clearing the hanging bishop but allowing white to restore a small measure of order to his pawn structure.} 22. cxd3 Qg2 23. Rhg1 {With no way to prevent losing the exchange, I continued setting up a strong attack in the hope that Black's queen being pulled away from the area would be enough compensation.} Ne2+ {Winning the exchange. Ironically, had he wanted, Black could have taken a draw with perpetual check at this point by moving the knight back and forth between a2 and c3.} 24. Rxe2 Qxe2 25. Bd4 {25. Bd4!  Considering White's many weaknesses (exposed king, compromised pawns, lost exchange), this simple move ensuring at least a draw is game-saving. Immediately sacrificing the rook with 25. Rxg7  fails to 25. ... Kxg7 26. Bd4  Kf8 27. Qh6  Ke7 28. Qg5  f6 29. Qxf6  Kd7 or (28. Qf6  Kd7) and Black's king escapes to an exposed but relatively safe area and white has next to nothing for his rook.  The 26. Qg5  Kf7 27. Bc5  Re7 line also loses.} Kf8 26. Bxg7+ {This ensures a draw by perpetual check.  I spent hours analysing 26. Rxg7 but could never come to a conclusion on whether White's king would ultimately be able to escape the Black onslaught.  Either way that would have been a great ending to a well fought game, but at the time I felt compelled to take the sure draw and win the mini-tournament.  If I had to do it over again though I think I would give Rxg7 a try.  I welcome any comments, especially if you have any input on this final question.  Perhaps a good chess software could give the answer. Thanks for your time and (hopefully) comments, Jboyette36}
