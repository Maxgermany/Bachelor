1. e4 {Second time up against Ion.  The first was two years ago.  } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {A fairly standard King's Pawn - Sicilian opening.} cxd4 {3. ...cxd4} 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4} Nf6 5. f3 Nc6 6. c4 {Trusting an opening database here.  This type of opening, where a weak square is created between two advanced pawns seems strange to me.  But the databases show decent success.  A trade off of strong influence over the opponent's 4th rank and some mobility for some weakness behind the advanced pawns.  white's lsb doesn't look great here either.  some hinderances for black. +++++ looking back from the end of the game, black does make very good use of the d4 square, his N and his B both making key stops there!  this opening might lead to success.  But it looks like I need to learn to play it correctly, ...adequate guarding of d4 being critical!  } Qb6 {two attackers on d4; plus pressure on b2.} 7. Nc2 {resolved.} g6 8. Nc3 Bg7 {black four pieces of his home rank.  white two.  a cost of the threat to the advanced N.} 9. Be2 O-O 10. Ne3 Be6 {black's development advantage increases.} 11. O-O Nd7 {seeking greener pastures and giving the B some running room.  +++++ that N does come back to close out the game.  enables B to make excellent use of d4 and then comes back to land coup de grace.   white's c pawn would be much more useful on c3!!!} 12. Ncd5 {prevents possible doubled pawns but options for the N are limited.} Bxd5 {BxN.} 13. cxd5 {13. cxd5.} Nd4 {13. ...Nd4, mainly a defensive move at this point?  but I believe I give this N some power a few moves along.  I did observe here that my lsb was partly bad.   It has a long diagonal but is cut off from half of the board.  probably a factor in Ion not playing NxB, this B not presenting a threat.  I on the other hand would have been happy for that exchange, active N for semi-bad B.  I also observed here that my potentially pinned N was a potential liability.  As it turns out that does cause trouble.  Note that occupation of d4 traces back to 6. c4.} 14. Rb1 {freeing the B, but too many other items on the to do list.} Rac8 {14. ...Rac8 sets up a very interesting and surprising move at 17.} 15. b4 {holding back black's second knight and giving my dsb some options.  all too slow I suppose.} f5 {15. ...f5, threatening trouble with ...f4, a potentially pinned N on e3. } 16. exf5 {16. exf5.  perhaps should have played Kh1.  Comments?} Nxf5 {Pinned N attacked twice.} 17. Rb3 {protected twice.  Black's B threatening trouble. } Rxc1 {there's the surprise! black exchanges R for B and, with recapture, white still has 2x protection on e3.  but that may not be enough.} 18. Qxc1 Nxe3 {white should have resisted...} 19. Rxe3 {...this unwise capture.  I can withstand the B, ...} Bd4 20. Kf2 {...with Kf2.  But can not withstand...} Nf6 {...the addition of another attacker.  white can not come away from the impending exchange without being a full piece down.  resigns.  Perhaps  could have stayed in the game a while if I had not played 19. Rxe3.  Thank you to Ion for the game.  Second Ion vs hogfysshe MT game already in progress.  Eeesh! }
