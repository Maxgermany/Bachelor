[Opening "Danish gambit (C21), Collijn defence"]

1. e4 {In this exciting encounter, White goes for the 'Full Danish' Gambit - you'll see what 'full' implies - and played throughout as he began, full of fight. Rather unwisely (and unnecessarily), I played an attacking line that was far riskier than I had calculated upon.  Though far behind in material, White's active pieces came within an ace of turning the tables.  Here's the plot.} e5 2. d4 {The Centre Game.  In my view it is really only worth playing this if you are going to play the Scotch Game, or a gambit.  I believe White knew exactly what he wanted to play the moment he saw my first move.} exd4 {Best.  There really is no better move than this capture.} 3. c3 {The beginning of a complex of gambit lines that could include the Scotch Gambit, the Goring, and, of course, the Danish in various forms.} dxc3 {Black could play safe, here, but I was prepared to live a little dangerously.} 4. Bc4 {Far out! The real deal, the 'full' Danish!} cxb2 5. Bxb2 {I recall seeing this for the first time as a schoolboy.  The line seemed so fraught with possibilities, the way those bishops raked down towards Black's undeveloped position.  As it turns out, Black's lack of development leaves him a position flexible in defence.} Nc6 {!?  It is hard to know what's best here.  This seemed safe enough.  I was within an ace of playing the 'Schlechter Antidote' here, and possibly my opponent was hoping I would try it on.  After 5...d5!?  6.Bxd5 Nf6  7.Bxf7ch! Kxf7  8.Qxd8 ... Has White won Black's Queen?  Not... quite: 8...Bb4ch  9.Qd2 Bxd2  10.Nxd2 c5.  The game becomes a battle between Black's 3-1 majority on the Q-side and White's 4-2 majority on the K-side.  My copy of MCO10 indicates Black would have the better of it, but I'm not so sure.} 6. Qf3 {Seeking immediate attack in return for the material invested.  Time is of the essence.} Nf6 {Blocks this attack.  If now 7.e5, ...Qe7 is a fine response, and 7...Bb4ch has its points as well.} 7. Qb3 {Taking up the attack from a fresh angle.  In response to 7.e5 I had prepared this reply: 7...Bb5ch!?  with the idea [A] 8.Nd2 Qe7 or [B] 8.Kf1 d5!  9.exf6 dxc4  10.fxg7 Rg8  11.Nc3 Rxg7.} Bb4+ {A tempo gainer.  After 8.Bc3 Bxc3ch or 8.Kf1 0-0, but instead...} 8. Nc3 Qe7 {Even better than castling.  White's exiguous centre comes under heavy pressure from Black's pieces.} 9. Nge2 {Partly to block the e-file, and partly to protect c3 whist he castled, I expect.  But this turns out to be a serious error, on account of the extra protection now given the Black Bishop on b4.  Better would have been 9.Bd3.} Na5 {[!] Black will now win a piece.  Already two pawns down, this further loss is serious for White.} 10. Bxf7+ {[!] His best response to contain the damage.  Black's game suffers some disruption.  Though Black has now a winning game, White does his best to make it difficult.} Kf8 {[!] Not 10...Qxf7? 11.Qxb4ch etc.  but now the White Queen can no longer maintain its guard over the bishop.} 11. Qc2 {Instead 11.Qa4 was worth a look.} Kxf7 {Takes with the King the sooner the rook can be hoiked out of the corner - castling 'long hand'.} 12. O-O Re8 13. a3 Bd6 {After a build-up phase, White's game does look the better developed.  But that +4 edge that Black has is hard to go past.} 14. Rfe1 {14.Ng3 was good.  The reason, however has little to do with what Black played next...} Bxh2+ {Whammo!  I really couldn't resist this, even though I knew that it would very likely compromise a big chunk of my present winning advantage.  Fairly sure that I kept at least a confortable edge, I didn't realize the extent to which I had committed myself to attack.} 15. Kxh2 {'Nothing venture, nothing win' - but there was absolutely no reason not to take.} Ng4+ {The charge of the Light Brigade.  But 15...Nc4 was something to think about.  It didn't cross my mind at the time, having this idee fixe on the K-side.} 16. Kg1 {I did have some vague hope he might play 16.Kg3? Qg5 and Black would have had fine chances.  But White is not interested in laying his head upon the block.} Qh4 {Yes, yes, I know: we're in Cro-Magnon country.  But this is a battle for the initiative as much as anything else.  There's quite a threat here: 17...Qxf2ch  18.Kh1 Qxg2ch!  19.Kxg2 Ne3ch  20.Kh1 Nxc2 and although Black won't win one of the rooks (21.Rf1ch gains time for escape), the extra 4 pawns will be enough.  There is, however a problem with this and the assortment of associated threats...} 17. Ng3 {They are too easily fended off.} Kg8 {Scuttling for cover betimes.  I did not want the King caught up in complications (hah!) and I wanted the f-file clear for the rook anyway.} 18. Nd5 {[!] Very good. Without reinforcements, Black's King side attack is headed down a blind alley.  In any case, often the best reposte to a flank action is a counter-action in the centre.} Rf8 19. Nf5 {[!]  Excellent move.  Blocking the f-file, attacking Black's Queen, and with hungry eyes upon the e7 and g7-squares as well.   The fork threat (Nxc7) is the least of it.  The biggy is this 20.Ndxe7ch Kh8?? (...Kf7 is forced in fact) 21.Bxg7#.  After a fair bit of thought, I found Black had no option but to carry on with his own attack.} Qh2+ 20. Kf1 Qh1+ 21. Ke2 Qxg2 {Having got this far, it was time for me to take my lumps.} 22. Bd4 {[!?] Understandably, I guess, White thought he had to defend f2.  I was expecting 22.Nde7ch here.  However, the bishop move isn't bad, and still goes toward attack on the Black king - a dual purpose move..} Nc6 {Hastily bringing  what reserves can quickly be deployed.  The threat it covers - that of a knight fork at c7 - was of not much concern, but this knight was performing other useful functions; striking at d4 and covering e7.  Now is the time for White to put Black's defences to the test...} 23. Qc3 {[??] A tragedy for White.  The right move here was precisely as I expected: 23.Nde7ch Kf7  (Remember what happened after 23...Kh8??; Nor would 23...Nxe7 been any good: 24.Rg1! Qh3  or 24...Nxf5  25.Qc4ch d5  26.Qxd5ch either way White is back in the game, good and properly)  24.Nxc6! bxc6! (...and not 24...dxc6?  25.Rg1 Qh3  26.Rg3 Qh5  27.Qb3ch! Be6  28.Qxe6ch Kxe6  29.Nxg7ch Kd7  30.Nxh5 and white emerges with a very slight material plus!).  I'll leave the analysis there, with about as murky a position as could be wished for.} Qxe4+ {That this pawn was left uncovered revived Black's flagging attack.  Henceforth White's game is totally wrecked.  } 24. Nfe3 {An attempt to defend King and d5-Knight both that leaves the Bishop uncovered.  But even the better 24.Kd2 lost a piece, so it doesn't do when things are this bad to be over-critical.  The deathblow was struck at move 23.} Nxd4+ {Black is now so far ahead in material that he can do without his Q-side pieces.} 25. Kd1 Nxf2+ 26. Kc1 Nd3+ {One of the hazards of scattered forces when your opponent has all the play. Forks turn up all over the place...} 27. Kb1 Nxe1+ {... and masked batteries...} 28. Kb2 Rf2+ 29. Nc2 Rxc2+ 30. Qxc2 Qxc2# {[0-1]  An ill-advised sacrifice by Black for a dubious attack, a well motivated counter-action by White, rising tension in a game of enormous complication - once the tension was broken, collapse came as suddenly as it often does when the complexity has reached a high level.  A fine game in the middle stages - a real stand-up fight.}
