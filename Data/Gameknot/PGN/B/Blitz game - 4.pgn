1. d4 Nf6 {I don't know this opening so I just wing it by playing what feels natural} 2. c4 {Starting with sticking another pawn in the middle.} g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 {I have an impressive pawn center, but can it hold?} d6 5. d5 Nbd7 {This blocks in blacks LSB, but it's still the best square for the knight.} 6. b3 O-O 7. f3 Nc5 8. Bg5 e5 {Locking up the center} 9. Bd3 Ncd7 {If he wanted his knight there why did he move it?} 10. Nge2 {I complete minor piece development} c6 11. Bxf6 {I felt the center was locked up enough for this exchange.} Nxf6 12. a4 a6 13. b4 Nh5 {Maybe preparing Qh4+?} 14. b5 c5 15. Qb3 {Now I'm almost finished with development, and black doesn't even have his LSB out. It doesn't come out until move 27.} a5 16. O-O-O {I actually felt queenside was safer because it was locked up.} b6 17. g4 Nf6 18. h4 {Continuing my pawn storm} Bh6+ {?? Blunder that loses a piece} 19. g5 Bg7 20. gxf6 {So I snaffle up his knight} Bxf6 {I would have used the queen} 21. h5 g5 22. Rdg1 h6 23. Ng3 {Bringing another piece into the attack} Bg7 24. Nf5 Qf6 25. Qc2 {Preparing to swing over to the kingside.} Bh8 {Black's position is like a sheet of glass, if you push too hard it will crack, and if you push even harder it will shatter. In this game, it does.} 26. Rgf1 Ra7 27. Rf2 Bxf5 {His LSB finally emerges} 28. exf5 {Only to die almost immediately } g4 {This loses a pawn} 29. fxg4 Qg5+ {This looks like it wins back the pawn but it doesn't.} 30. Qd2 Qxg4 {??????? How many question marks would you like to give this?} 31. Rg2 Qxg2 32. Qxg2+ {And bam! Black's position has cracked badly, I have an open file to his king.} Bg7 33. Rg1 {Doubling up, but better would have been advancing my f pawn.} f6 34. Ne4 Kh8 35. Nxd6 {My knight gobbles a pawn} Rg8 {Adding more defense to the bishop} 36. Qg6 Rd7 {The glass is creaking...} 37. Nf7+ {IT SHATTERS!!} Rxf7 38. Qxf7 {If I was black I'd resign now, but he plays on} Kh7 39. Rg6 Kh8 {Black is reduced to shunting his king back and forth.} 40. d6 Kh7 41. Rxf6 {Taking advantage of the pinned bishop} Kh8 42. Re6 {This threatens a forced exchange.} Bf8 {Blocks it} 43. d7 {The bishop blocks the rook from attacking the promotion square} Rg1+ {He keeps playing until the checks run out. There's no need for further annotation. Please drop a comment and rate it on the star system.} 44. Kc2 Rg2+ 45. Kc3 Rg3 46. Qxf8+ {}
