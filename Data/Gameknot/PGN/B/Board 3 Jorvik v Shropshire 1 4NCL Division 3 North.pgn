1. e4 {This was a painful loss. I get the better game. He does a sacrifice to get a perpetual and finds that he has a win, not a draw.} c5 {It is also a work in progress, I will add in computer analysis at some point.} 2. Nc3 {He plays a closed Sicilian.} Nc6 {So I just develop.} 3. g3 {I was expecting this. He has played this before this season in the 4NCL.} e6 {I continue with the line that he lost to earlier in the season.} 4. Bg2 {He completes the finachetto.} Nf6 {I develop my knight.} 5. f4 {He played Ng-e2 last time.} d5 {So I advance in the centre.} 6. d3 {Perfectly playable although e4-e5 is more aggressive.} d4 {So I advance again.} 7. Nce2 {Knight drops back.} e5 {The pawn formation now looks a bit like a King's Indian Reversed, although white has already got f2-f4 in, which should be to white's advantage.} 8. Nf3 {He continues to develop.} Bd6 {I need to protect e5 again.} 9. O-O {He castles, and I have a long think. I considered 0-0 but I was a bit afraid of f4-f5 and a pawn storm against my castled king. After the game I discovered that I was right to fear this - f4-f5 scores well for white in the opening databases. Bg4, h6 , Qc7 and Ng4 have all also been played in this position, with varying degrees of success. What I played though seems to be relatively untried - at least in the opening databases I use.} Bc7 {The idea is to play my bishop to a5, and develop it outside the pawn chain.} 10. h3 {A waiting move, but also perhaps supporting g3-g4 at some point and also stopping Nf6-g4.} Nd7 {I re-enforce e5.} 11. Bd2 {He develops.} Ba5 {I attempt to exchange off my bad bishop.} 12. Bc1 {And his bishop just drops back.} f6 {Freeing up my knights, particularly the d7 one.} 13. fxe5 {He takes.} Ndxe5 {I take back.} 14. Nf4 {Heading for d5.....} O-O {I thought it was safe enough to castle now.} 15. Nh2 {Not sure what the idea was here.} c4 {I continue with my queen-side operations.} 16. Nf3 {And his knight comes back.} b5 {I continue with my queen-side play.} 17. Nd5 {His knight reaches d5} Be6 {I challenge it.} 18. Nxe5 {Perhaps I should not have allowed this - if I take back with my knight my d4 pawn goes, so I have to take back with a pawn. Ideally I would prefer a knight on e5, not a pawn.} fxe5 {So I take back.} 19. dxc4 {He takes.} bxc4 {I take back.} 20. Qe2 {He attacks c4.} Rc8 {I indirectly protect it.} 21. Rxf8+ {He takes with check.} Qxf8 {I take back.} 22. Bg5 {The bishop comes out.} h6 {I attack the bishop.} 23. Rf1 {He attacks my queen.} Qc5 {This may have been a mistake - on d6 my queen is able to defend the king-side better.} 24. Bxh6 {I thought this was unsound. After the game we were looking at d3+ 25.	Qe3	Qxe3+ 26.	Bxe3	dxc2 27.	Rc1	Nd4 28.	Bxd4	exd4 29.	Rxc2	d3 30.	Rc1	d2 31.	Rd1	Bxd5 32.	exd5	Re8 33.	Bf3	with a probable draw.} gxh6 {But I took.} 25. Qh5 {With threats.} Bxd5 {Thinking the game would end in perpetual check.} 26. Qg6+ {He checks.} Kh8 {Forced!} 27. Qxh6+ {Check again.} Kg8 {Forced again.} 28. Qg6+ {Check again.} Kh8 {Forced again.} 29. Rf5 {Threatening mate.} d3+ {I throw in a spite check, hoping for 30. Kf8?? Kf8 drawing.} 30. Kh2 {But he doesn't fall for that, and I resigned here.}
