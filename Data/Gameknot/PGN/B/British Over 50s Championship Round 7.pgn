1. Nf3 {Reminder of the time limit - 40 moves in 90 minutes, plus 30 minutes if your time runs out before then, plus 30 second increment. Again I was late for the start, due to heavy traffic on the A55, I was about 10 minutes late. I hope to rattle out moves of a Sicilian Defence or a Gr√ºnfeld Defence, but it was not to be. I paused before playing...} d5 {Probably leading to a King's Indian Defence reversed I thought.} 2. b3 {OK maybe a Queen's Indian Reversed I thought.} c5 {So I played this.} 3. e4 {And then he comes up with this. I sank deep into thought. A reversed Budapest Defence! Never met it before! I considered dxe4. Now in the Budapest Defence, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but that line has rather been put out of fashion by 4. a3! which stops any tricks based in ....Bf8-b4+. So I didn't really look at 3...dxe4 4. Ne5, thinking that 4.....a6 would refute it, and spent most of my time looking at 3....dxe4 4. Ng4, and all the complications of the Budapest Defence but with white having the extra move, which I decided to avoid. After the game my opponent showed me a trap, 3.... dxe4 4. Ne5 Qd4 5. Bb2 Qxb2 6. Nc3 and the black queen is trapped, for instance 6.....Qa3 7. Bb5+ and 8. Nc4. So after 3....dxe4 4. Ne5 is the most common move, and 4....a6 is the best next move. However I led the game down a different route.} d4 {By playing this, I hoped to keep the position closed.} 4. Bb5+ {He instantly whipped out this move.} Nd7 {I felt I wanted to conserve my good light squared bishop and I didn't want him doubling my pawns after 4...Nc6 and him taking on c6 at some stage.} 5. c3 {He threatens to take my c pawn.} a6 {So I hit his bishop.} 6. Bxd7+ {He takes.} Qxd7 {I take back this way, to give protection to d4.} 7. cxd4 {He takes.} cxd4 {I take back.} 8. Bb2 {He attacks d4.} d3 {Unable to safely protect it again, I advance it.} 9. Ne5 {He comes in with this fork. I realise that I am going to lose my d pawn as Qf3 is coming.} Qe6 {I try this, hoping that he will take the d pawn and I will take on e4.} 10. Qf3 {But is plays this.} f6 {I hit his knight.} 11. Nxd3 {He takes. Now he is a pawn up, and better development. It should be a winning advantage for white.} Qc6 {My plan is to play e7-e5 and make his extra pawn on d2 backward on a semi-open file.} 12. Nb4 {He hits my queen.} Qc5 {Queen moves.} 13. Nd5 {Knight comes in.} e6 {I hit his knight.} 14. Ba3 {He hits my queen.} Qd4 {I attack his rook, his knight is still hanging.} 15. Ndc3 {After a long think, he realises that tactics based on Nc7+ and/or Bxf8 don't quite work.} Bxa3 {I am getting back into the game now.} 16. Nxa3 {He takes back.} e5 {I finally secure the centre, and his pawn on d2 is backward on a semi-open file.} 17. O-O {Castles} Be6 {Stopping his knight returning to d5 I thought.} 18. Nd5 {But he plays it anyway. This leads to the loss of a pawn and slight advantage to black.} Bxd5 {So I take.} 19. exd5 {He takes back.} Rd8 {I attack his pawn again.} 20. d6 {he advances.} Rd7 {I protect b7.} 21. Nc4 {His knight protects d6.} Nh6 {Preparing to castle. I can win the d6 pawn either by Nf7 at some stage or b7-b5 driving away his knight protecting it. Black has at least equalised. } 22. Qe3 {He decides to exchange my dominant queen.} Nf5 {But my knight comes in.} 23. Qxd4 {He takes, and offered a draw, which I declined.} Nxd4 {My knight is now dominant.} 24. g3 {Perhaps planning f2-f4.} b5 {I decide to round up the d6 pawn.} 25. Ne3 {His knight drops back.} Rxd6 {The pawn goes.} 26. Kg2 {He improves the position of his king.} e4 {I prevent f2-f4, which would now be met by taking his f pawn en passant. } 27. Rac1 {He contests the c file.} Kd7 {I bock his entry squares on c8, c7 and c6.} 28. Rc5 {So he comes in here instead.} Rc8 {I contest the c file.} 29. Rxc8 {He takes.} Kxc8 {I take back.} 30. Rc1+ {He throws in a check.} Kd7 {I return to d7.} 31. d3 {He can't keep hold of this pawn without completely tying up his pieces.} Ne2 {I hit his rook.} 32. Rd1 {Rook moves.} Rxd3 {I take.} 33. Rxd3+ {He takes back.} exd3 {I take.} 34. Nd1 {He blocks the pawn with his knight.} b4 {I tie down his queen-side pawns.} 35. Kf3 {His king comes across to help.} Nc3 {He resigns.
