1. e4 {Standard.} f6 {But, black plays something very unusual.  More common was 1...e5, or 1...c5  This move doesn't help develop, or anything similar, except pushing pawns.  Now, TA mentions that in his club and it's one reason that he's going to sac on a different square then usual.} 2. Qh5+ g6 {Forced.} 3. Qxh7 {So, this is where it begins.  Now, as Joe noted, this time, black doesn't have to take.  But, it is, nonetheless, the best move here.  It's also worth noting that, unlike my last annotation, TA doesn't have any real plans.  He sees weaknesses by black is bound to take advantage.  That's where, later on, theory will mix in.} Rxh7 4. Nf3 {Standard development.} e5 {Also developing, but with his central pawn.} 5. Nc3 {Nothing new here.} c6 {But, that can't be said here.  Now, what TA noted is the fact that black is just pushing pawns, when the time ought to be used to develop and deploy his pieces.  That should give some compensation in a later on.} 6. d4 {With that being said, white isn't waisting time or taking chances.} d6 {He also could play 6...d5, and white would decide which pawn to take.  } 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Bc4 {As noted, despite being behind, material wise, white already has a solid lead in development.  In fact, it's almost complete and only needs to deploy one piece, whereas, black did not bring a single minor piece, into play, yet. } Nh6 {That changes here, but he's still way behind there.} 9. O-O {So, white takes advantage of that by castling, immediately.} Qe7 {The same idea since black's Q is out way too early when it isn't needed since, as of the moment, there is not an exception to the guideline as white doesn't have threats, yet.} 10. h3 {Since ...Ng4 followed by ...Rxh2 could become a threat, should white's N ever move, TA decided to add an extra defender to the h file.} Be6 {Continuing to develop.} 11. Bb3 {I don't know why white played this, as opposed to, 11.Bxe6, and after black takes back there aren't doubled pawns.  But, with this move, however, black will double up white's pawns.} Bxb3 12. axb3 g5 {With the plan to fork N and P, so that if ...PXP, white's K becomes wide open, which is known to put you at a disadvantage.  With the N here, however, the K is no longer open, as we have an extra defender around it.} 13. Nh2 {So, he won't allow that.} Qe6 {Like before, this doesn't help with his development.} 14. Be3 {Waisting no time, white completes it.} g4 {Now, black attempts to exchange.} 15. h4 {Yes, I have seen this response in IM and GM games, as well.  That instead of exchanging, white advances further.  Now, what I wonder is why do they do this.  To me, it would've been overgeneralizing, as it was with dynamic_dv.  So, I would've exchanged with 15.hxg4  Despite not liking those doubled pawns, that's what I'm most comfortable.  And, I like to go by what I'm most accustomed to or comfortable with.} f5 {? The plan is to either advance his pawn which would gain tempo by attacking the DSB, or he thinks that white will exchange starting with 16.exf5  However, this move gives back a pawn to black.  So, better was 15...a6, 15...b6, or 15...c6 as all of these protect the a pawn.} 16. Bxa7 Nd7 {Not only developing but protecting his N, as well.} 17. Rfd1 {So, white puts pressure on d7.} fxe4 18. Be3 {I would've played 18.Nxe4 to get the pawn back.  But, the fact that white doesn't means that TA has strategy.  At first, I wasn't sure what it was, but it makes sense.  The plan is either get a R or create a threat.  For example, if 8...Rxa1, if 9.Rxa1, now black can't castle because he'd have to bring the N to b8, if black were to avoid a K exposure.  Yes, even being a Q up, you can't let your K become exposed, especially against a stronger player.} Nf5 {? This move gives white back a R, as compensation.  Plus, as noted, black's monarch becomes exposed here.  Best was 18...Rxa1.} 19. Rxa8+ Kf7 {?? According to TA, this was a super blunder, and I agree with him.  The idea being now that white will get a family fork and, thus, win something much more valuable.  So, although black has the Q, when all is said done, white will become ahead.  And, with best play, as it will be, white should win the game.  With that being said, best was 19...Bh6} 20. Nxe4 Nxe3 21. Ng5+ Kf6 22. Nxh7+ {I'm surprised that TA did not play 22.Nxe6, as that's what I would've done.  I believe that white wanted to get something, in such a way, that black can't take back which is why he would capture here.} Kg7 {And, now is the time to exchange because, as it turns out, this is liquidation, as white is going to wind up a piece ahead.} 23. Nxf8 Nxf8 24. fxe3 {That is how.} Ng6 {Getting the last piece out, but it's too little, too late because of what white now has.  The game isn't lost, yet, but black is now at a serious disadvantage.  By that, I mean worse then it appears.} 25. g3 {Adding to his advantages with this pawn chain.  And, now that we're nearing the endgame, the K will start to become a weapon, soon.} e4 {Stopping white's center pawn from advancing further.} 26. Kg2 {But, this is where TA uses his K as a weapon.  The long term plan, of course, is to centralize his K so that it's near his opponents K so that you have known and dangerous fortress around it.  That's known in endgames starting with a process called triangulation.  That is, where you move it in a triangle.} Qf5 {There is a chance that white's N would move.  And, if that happens, black would have a dangerous threat with ...Ne5 followed by ...Qf3+, which appears to be his goal.} 27. Rdd8 {But, white has other ideas, first.} Ne5 {Yes, this is part of black's plan, as noted on his last move.} 28. Rdg8+ {But, this was white's plan, though.  And, now black is in more trouble, then earlier.} Kh7 29. Rgh8+ Kg7 {Black is attempting to trick white into a draw by repetition since his K was on this square before 28.Rg8+} 30. Rag8+ {! But, white doesn't allow it.  Note: It'd be very easy to play the wrong move with 30.Rhg8+, and after 30...Kh7, it's a draw by repetition.  But, this move prevents that as the monarch can't go there.  Now, I don't usually mention that, but it really isn't that obvious because, while it was much earlier in the game, easy19 made a similar mistake in our first game each, so I was able to get a draw by rep, out of him.  And, now I compare that game and mistake I made with the B+N mate the first three time.  So, it boils down to the same thing.  Why allow a draw, when you have a winning advantage? } Kf6 31. Rh6+ {Adding to his advantages, TA plays this to put pressure against black's Q, which will soon prove useful.} Ke7 32. Rg5 {And, this is where that happens.} Qf3+ {?? I understand this move very well as black thought that he a mating sequence.  He was thinking along the lines of 33.Kg1, Qxg3+ 34.Kh1, Nf3, followed by 35...Qxh2#  Or if white played 34.Kf1, then comes 34...Nf3, followed by 35...Qf2#  However, black overlooked the N.  Therefore, white is going to get the Q for a N, in addition to what joseph82501 has lost.  So, with it, TA implied the same thing that Jack Stockel would say in his club.  "This loses immediately."  That's because in addition to being ahead, black is going to get back his Q.  And, TA directly stated that once black gave him back the Q, it was all over, from then on.  Better was to retreat to the seventh or eighth rank. } 33. Nxf3 exf3+ 34. Kf2 {This is the triangulation I was alluding to earlier since the K was originally on g1, went to g2 earlier, and has now traveled to f2.  As I learned from Susan Polgar, in endgames, this is very damaging.  That is the "systematic method", that I once learned about since it involves trigonometry.  The idea is that the K has now gone in a triangle which is known to be problematic for the opponent.  } Nd7 {Getting the N to safety, but it's no use any longer.  It does keep black in a little longer, but it is, nontheless, a clear win for white.} 35. Rg7+ {Starting with this move.} Kd8 36. Rd6 {!! Black will lose his remaining piece no matter what he does since it's now pinned.  In addition, white will pick up another pawn.} Kc7 37. Rdxd7+ Kb6 38. Rdxb7+ Kc5 39. Rg6 {Indirectly putting pressure on the c6 pawn with the plan being 40.Rc7} Kd5 {Black stops it but not for long.} 40. e4+ Kd4 {Nothing is going to help black no matter what he does.  Not even 41...Kxe4+  Even after that, black might as well resign.  For example, after 41...Kxe4, 42.Rb4+, Kf5 43.Rbxg4, Ke5 44.Kxf3, Kd5 45.c4+, Ke5 46.R4g5+, Kd4 47.Rxc6, and black has nothing else, except for his K.} 41. Rg5 {Putting the pressure right on black and preparing to mate him, right away.  The plan being 42.Rb4#} c5 {! Stopping the mate for now, but not for long.} 42. Re7 {So, TA comes up with another way.  But, this time, there is no way to prevent or delay mate.} c4 43. Rd5# {The first lesson that we learn is not becoming overly confident, even when you have the winning position.  But, the second lesson that he taught is, that being a Q up with an advantage does not mean that you abandon general opening guidelines.  For example, like with my last game against Mary, black pushed pawns, and even brought the Q out early, when he used that time to develop his pieces and castle.  Also and it's something that I've forgotten but when making moves, be very careful and really study the position.  For example, black earlier made a move as it appeared good to get out of check, but what he didn't realize is that white would go from behind to ahead.  That gave him an advantage.  And, black made another blunder because he thought that there was a mating sequence but overlooked the N.  In doing so, white won back the Q in addition to all else, and was, therefore, able to force this win.}
