1. Nf3 {This is a very interesting attacking miniature, which also features a clever way to play against the Reti Opening.  However, what is actually more impressive in this game is what doesn't transpire over the board.  This game definitely will appeal to Dutch Defense players who face 1. Nf3.} d5 { } 2. g3 {Kramnik doesn't like to enter the reverse Benoni lines after 2. c4 d4.  It is probably worthy to note that Kramnik would normally play 2. d4 here, however, this game was the last in a winner take all tournament and he was looking to avoid any preparation that his opponent might have done prior to the match.} c6 {Black begins to secure his center, while leaving the c8-h3 diagonal open for the bishop.  This is a very flexible way of playing the opening.} 3. Bg2 { } Bg4 {This move is very logical, as Black intends on closing the light squares with ...e6.  If 3...Nf6; 4. c4 Bg4, White has the very sharp 5.  Ne5 Bh5; 6. cd cd; 7. Qa4  Nbd7; 8. Nc3 e6; 9. g4!  Black is having difficulties.} 4. O-O {White keeps his options open as well.} Nd7 {Black is preparing an advance in the center.} 5. d4 {White finally commits in the center, as ...e5 was Black's idea.} e6 {Black has a strong center and a very logical developmental plan.  White's central pawn breaks are c4 and e4.  Black prevents this in an interesting way.} 6. Nbd2 {Leaving the possibility of both breaks open.} f5 {This move radically prevents the e4 break, which White was going to play after ...Ngf6; 7. Re1.} 7. c4 {White reverts to the other plan of attack.} Bd6 {Now Black can develop the knight flexible and either move to f6 or f7 via h6.  If Black is able to develop the knight and castle, then he will have no problems as he has a favorable version of the stonewall with the bishop outside of the pawn chain.} 8. Qb3 {Kramnik decides that the Black kingside is underdeveloped and undertakes active operations to keep Black off balance.} Rb8 {If the queen moves to defend the pawn, then Ng5 leaves White better.} 9. Re1 {This move indicates that White wants to play e4, however, this looks difficult at the moment.} Nh6 {After 9...Ngf6; 10. cd cd; 11. Ng5 Qe7; 12. f3 Bh5; 13. e4, White would begin a direct attack against the Black king.} 10. cxd5 { } cxd5 { } 11. h3 {There had been one previous game in the database prior to this game, when White illogically blocked the e-file with Ne5.  After a few moves, a draw was agreed.  Kramnik is looking to open the e-file against the enemy king, which is precariously placed in the center.} Bh5 {This move loses in a very surprising fashion, however, 11...Bxf3; 12. exf3, Black cannot save the e6-pawn without losing the right to castle and he is unable to deploy the knights to good squares.} 12. e4 {Forcing Black's hand in the center and shattering the stone wall.} fxe4 { } 13. Ng5 {Black was expecting 13. Nxe4.} Bf7 {If 13...Qxg5; 14. Nxe4 Qe7, White has two ways of keeping an overwhelming advantage.  15.  Bg5 Nf6 (15...Qf8; 16. Qxd5! ed; 17. Nxd6#); 16. Nxf6  gxf6; 17. Bxh6, when the attack continues, or White can play 15. Nxd6  Qxd6; 16. Bf4, when White picks up the b8-rook and the weak pawns on d5, e6 and b7.  If 13...Qe7; 14. Nxe6 Bf7; 15. Nxg7  Kf8; 16. Nxe4 Kxg7; 17. Bg5 Qf8; 18. Bxh6 Kxh6; 19. Qe3  Kg7; 20. Qg5 , when mate is a few moves off.} 14. Ndxe4 { } dxe4 { } 15. Nxe6 { } Bxe6 {Black could prolong the struggle with 15...Qf6; 16. Rxe4 Be7.} 16. Qxe6+ { } Qe7 { } 17. Rxe4 { } Kd8 { } 18. Qd5 {Here Black resigned, however, after 18...Nf6; 19. Rxe7 Nxd5; 20. Re6, regains the piece and transposes into a won ending.}
