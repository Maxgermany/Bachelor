1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 {The alternative ideas of delaying e2-e4 gives black no trouble at all. Alternative variation: 6. g3 g6 7. Bg2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 Alternative variation: 6. Nf3 g6 7. e4 Bg7 8. h3 O-O 9. Bd3 b5 } g6 7. Nf3 {7. f4!? white transposes into the once feared four pawns attack. However, after the 7. ...Bg7 black has managed to neutralize all of white's responses. Having said that 7.f4 is the strongest test of black's knowledge and preparedness in benoni.  Alternative variation: 7. f4 Bg7 8. Bb5+ (8. Nf3 O-O 9. Bd3 Re8 10. O-O c4 [=])8... Nbd7 9. e5 dxe5 10. fxe5 Nh5 11. e6 Qh4+ 12. Kd2 fxe6 [=] } Bg7 8. h3 {This was one of white's first improvements in the developmental history of the Modern Benoni. White takes some time to prevent ...Bg4 which has led to some favorable lines for black in the past. The idea of ...Bg4 is that black will exchange his weak LSB for the critical knight on f3. The absence of the f3 knight makes e4-e5 much more difficult for white.  } O-O 9. Bd3 {Alternative variation: 9. Bg5 [is met by ] 9... Re8 10. Bd3 c4 Alternative variation: 9. Be2 Re8 10. Nd2 Na6 11. O-O Nc7 12. a4 Rb8 [⩲] } b5 {!? This is black's most ambitious move against the modern main line. This idea is to deflect some of white's piece away from e4 and getting the chance to capture the important e-pawn.  From here on out it is black not white who dictates the direction of the game.  } 10. Nxb5 {Alternative variation: 10. Bxb5 Nxe4 11. Nxe4 Qa5+ [regains the material with equality] } Re8 11. O-O Nxe4 {! I give this an exclamation mark not because it is a great move, but because I want to stress the how important the capture of the e-pawn is to black's survival and attacking chances.  } 12. Re1 {Alternative variation: 12. Qa4 [!?] 12... a6 13. Bxe4 Bd7 14. Bd3 Qb6 15. Ng5 Bxb5 (15... axb5 [!?] 16. Qh4 (16. Qxa8 [?!] 16... Na6 17. Qxe8+ Bxe8 18. Re1 [⩱])16... h6 17. Nxf7 Kxf7 18. Bxh6 Rh8 [∞])16. Bxb5 Qxb5 17. Qh4 h5 18. Qg3 Nd7 } a6 {only move! } 13. Bxe4 {?! Alternative variation: 13. Na3 Nf6 14. Rxe8+ Nxe8 15. Nc4 Nd7 16. Bd2 Bb7 [attacking d5] Alternative variation: 13. Rxe4 axb5 [is similar to the game move order] } axb5 {∓ this is the kind of position that black dreams about.   } 14. Rb1 {?? drops the a-pawn Alternative variation: [better is ] 14. Bg5 Qd7 15. Qd2 Bb7 16. Bh6 Na6 17. Bxg7 Kxg7 [⩱] } Rxa2 15. Qb3 {With the open a-file and powerful queen side pawns the position is similar to favorable benko positions for black. The black pieces will pour through the queen side.  } Ra4 {I return back to my original plan which is to attack e4 and win that square at all costs.  } 16. Nd2 {?? Alternative variation: [best ] 16. Bc2 Qd7 [only move ] (16... Rb4 [?!] 17. Rxe8+ Qxe8)17. Rxe8+ Qxe8 } f5 17. Qxb5 {I like this as it takes some of the sting out of the queen side pawns.  } Rb4 18. Qd3 fxe4 19. Nxe4 Rexe4 20. Rxe4 Bf5 {? Alternative variation: [more to the point is ] 20... Rxe4 21. Qxe4 Bf5 22. Qe1 Bxb1 23. Qe6+ Kh8 [−⁠+]  } 21. f3 Nd7 {Alternative variation: [equally good is ] 21... Bxe4 22. fxe4 Nd7 23.
