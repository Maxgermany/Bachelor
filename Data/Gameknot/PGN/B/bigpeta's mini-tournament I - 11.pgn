1. c4 {Most popular start...also looked at Pete's white wins.} Nf6 2. Nc3 {Most popular start. Nc3 coveres e4 square} e5 3. Nf3 {This is also the most popular and after looking at other option decided to go with it.} d6 4. d4 {d4....to gain control centre} exd4 5. Nxd4 {Better to take with the N than bring the Q out too early.} Be7 6. g3 {seemed the next logical move getting ready to 0-0} Nbd7 7. Bg2 {Bg2 ready for 0-0} c6 8. Nf3 {With c6 move I figure next move would be to attack my c4 pawn with d5 so moved my N away to allow for open file for Q} Nb6 9. b3 {b3 covers the pawn on c4 and a4 } h6 10. O-O {He will 0-0  then maybe e4?} Bg4 11. h3 {I toyed with Bb2 and e4 but that would leave a Q and N pin, not good.  As I don't like unresolved issues I decided on h3 forcing a move on his part.} Bf5 12. Re1 {Re1 getting ready to e4} O-O 13. e4 Bh7 14. Bb2 {Bb2 gets Rook connect after Q move ....} Qc7 15. Qd2 {I figure that there will be an attack on d file d5 is covered by the 2 Knights} Rad8 16. Qe3 {Need to get Q off d file. Next move maybe Nd4} Rfe8 17. Rad1 {I need a line of retreat so my Q is not in danger on e file if snowman's B is moved I will be pinned. R also covers d file.  decided I needed to deal with that danger before anything else.  } Nbd7 18. Rd2 {I should have moved Re2 and then Rd1 to e1 rather than Rd2 because I just blocked Q's line of retreat. Getting ready to move Re1 to attack on e file.                                                                                                                                                                       I should hav                                                                                             I should have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        } d5 19. cxd5 {I made a tactical error having Q vulnerable to a potential fork so best to take wih c4 I was thinking of e5 threatening N but with the Q where she is could lead to problems.} cxd5 20. Nxd5 {I have great difficulty when moves become complicated and thinking through all the different scenarios. After about half hour of thinking I decided to threaten his Q} Nxd5 21. Rxd5 {I ha ve made a big mistake here my queen is vulnerable as it my rook on e file from B} Bc5 22. Qc3 f6 23. e5 {I dont do well in complicated endings where there are a lot of pieces on the board....AGE related i think! I decided to keep applying pressure with pawn....if I can break down his pawn defence then my queen is in direct line to check his K} Rdc8 24. exf6 Rxe1+ 25. Qxe1 {Nxf6 then perhaps Bxf6 then g7xf6 ....still thinking this through.  } Nxf6 26. Qe6+ Kh8 27. Bxf6 {my king is vulnerable but I had to take the N as my Rook was in peril and the n was too dangerous... } gxf6 28. Qxf6+ Kg8 29. Qe6+ {Positionally i needed to get Q on e file...This will be tricky as he has two B's and an open board.} Kh8 30. Qxh6 {I thought long and hard about taking pawn on h file.  My king is feeling vulnerable but i didn't want to lose tempo and I have c1 covered and also if Bxf2 kxf2 and Qc2+ then i move Rd2 covered by N on f3} Qf7 31. Rd2 Rg8 32. Nd4 {His idea is to attack with Rook on g3 I wouldn't be able to take with f2 as it would be pinned by his B but Nd4 blocks the B ...I NEED to resolve the king's position!} Rg6 33. Qh5 Qe7 34. Re2 Qd7 35. Qxc5 {}
