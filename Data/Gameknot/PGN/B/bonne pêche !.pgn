1. d4 {first 9 moves are wallstone attack opening....} Nf6 2. e3 g6 3. Bd3 d5 4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O c5 7. c3 b6 8. Nbd2 Bg4 9. Qe1 {so nothing special untill now. The the black lsb should be better, in my opinion in b7, the the black knight can go to e4 (...Ne4, Bd3xNe4-d5xe4 and then the white position is quite bad wiht no way to move the rook to f3, which is one of the important lines.) But now if Bg4xNf3, it loose bishop just for a knight and help me developing.} Bxf3 10. Rxf3 {may be better to retake with knight ? This was in order to move the rook to h colon.} Nbd7 11. h3 {I'm playing with a ggod challenger, so  in this case i alway try to do something risky and aggressive, in order to give at least a little fun to my oponent } Ne4 {Ne4? this is a bad black move, i dont understand it. It jus loose a pawn and will stay under the bishop threat (e4/a8 diagonal)} 12. Nxe4 dxe4 13. Bxe4 {black has to defend, white is quite well developped. Center is mine and strong. C5 cannot destroy it because  of e3 retake and keep occupying the space} Rc8 14. g4 {risking every thing. Chess has must stay a game !} cxd4 {this was expected. it will open the e colon, and help me developing the dsb an, so, joining the rooks} 15. exd4 Nf6 16. Bc2 {i will tr to kill this knight} e6 17. g5 {it will go to g5, then i will exchange it whith my lsb and open the g colon} Nh5 18. Bd1 Qd6 19. Rf2 {ho ! this was a mistake from me. now the black knight can escape to g3. I should play Rf1.} b5 {well, i'm lucky !} 20. Bxh5 gxh5 {nice position for me. I will try to attack the a3/f8 diagonal from here, ...and it will work !} 21. a4 {first : pretending to attackk the a colon, but the idea is then to move the dsb on a3 protected by rook...} b4 {Ok, nice response. I will sacrifice a pawn} 22. b3 {second : now i'm ready. This is a little trapp. 2087 elo should see it, but mlaybe he is thinking that with a 1451 elo it will be easy...} bxc3 23. Ba3 {now i'm so happy !! But, this c3 pawm is very very dangerous. And i will have to manage with a big theat on d4...one thing at a time} Qb6 {ho, terrible threat on d4 :(} 24. Bxf8 {but the black rook is mine !} Kxf8 25. Rc2 Qxb3 26. Rac1 {I might be lost with Bg7xd4+, but now i have tempo} Bxd4+ {not so dangerous now.} 27. Kh2 Qxa4 28. Qe4 {this is the awfull BIG blunder i did on this game, i should loose my queen (Bd4 g1+...Qa4xQe4). I dont now wy, maybe duarte wanted to give me a chance ?} Qd7 {defending the bishop, i can attak on h7 !} 29. Qxh7 {but i wont go on to win the c8 rook, it wont be easy to win something from now} Qd6 {i have to defend f4, i will first move Qh6 then move the pawn g5 g6...} 30. Qh6+ Ke7 31. g6 {in this position i should find something interesting to do } Rh8 {not a problem, Qg5+} 32. Qg5+ Bf6 33. Qg3 Rg8 {i still can defend f4, but i think i will loose g6...   :(} 34. Qe3 {in order to Qe3xa7+} Rxg6 35. Qxa7+ {so i still have a interesting attack position} Kf8 {from now i will exchange the rooks on g2 and bring back my queen there to keep it in the game. so first i will chess the king on a8 (targeting g2). But first i have to defend f4} 36. Rf1 h4 37. Qa8+ Kg7 38. Rg2 {here we are !} Qd3 {exchanging rook will give more oportunities to attack the king and find the mate.} 39. Rxg6+ {so is black going to retake with the king or with the f7 pawn ? What whould you do ??} Kxg6 {king. This give the oportunities to keep on attacking with the rook. It's becoming dangerous for balcks...} 40. Rg1+ Kf5 41. Qa5+ e5 42. Rg5+ {this was not the best idea from me ...of course if ...Bf6xRg5 - Qa5xe5+ and it's quite a mate, but king can take f4 and that' all } Kxf4 43. Rg4+ {maintaining the initiative} Kf5 44. Qa8 {preparing or  Qc8+ or Qf3+ ...} Qe2+ {of course, but it s easy to defend } 45. Rg2 {and now i have a tempo to keep on attacking} Qe3 46. Qc8+ Ke4 {there is a lot of ways to go on ttacking searching the mate, is Rg4 the best ?} 47. Rg4+ {i hope so !} Kd3 {in this situation, i must find the mate, otherwise i will be dead ! because i will never be abble to stop promotion of pawns} 48. Qf5+ e4 49. Rg2 {this was not the move i expect, it's just a mistake, i was thing in moving the queen !! but , lucky blitz, it was the winning move !} Bd4 {do you see the mate ?? Duarte didnt. } 50. Qb5# {mate. I hope you appreciate this anotation of a "non serious" game. Bst rgrds denis}
