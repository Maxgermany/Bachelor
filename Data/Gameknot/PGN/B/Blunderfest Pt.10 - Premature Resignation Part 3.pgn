1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This is just so agonizing.  I came very close here to ending my losing streak with Coach Ion.  Incredibly the only real mistake I made in the game was to resign it!  I did keep in my game notes the analysis I made before the decision to resign so I will show them to you so you will at least see just what prompted my decision.  I kick off with 1. e4 and Ion gives me the Robatsch Defense.} g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Nf3 {4.  Nf3 - the last time I faced this opening against Coach Ion I played f4.  The game went like this:- http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/castling-into-it?gm=20912} a6 5. a4 b6 6. g3 {6. g3 - now I prepare to fianchetto Fou Leblanc.} Bb7 7. Bg2 Nd7 8. O-O e6 9. Re1 {9. Re1 - always a good idea to line your rook on same file as enemy queen or king.} Ne7 10. Be3 O-O 11. Qd2 {11. Qd2 - I am preparing to exchange dsbs here.} c5 12. dxc5 Nxc5 {12. ....... Nxc5 - pawn trade.} 13. Bh6 {13. Bh6 - I now put my earlier plan into action.} d5 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 {14. ...... Kxg7 - the trade takes place as planned.} 15. exd5 Nxd5 {15. ...... Nxd5 - pawn trade.} 16. Nxd5 Bxd5 {16. .... Bxd5} 17. b3 {17. b3 - I will soon want to centralise my queen rook so I give my a4 pawn some back up.} Qf6 18. Qd4 {18. Qd4 - forcing a queen trade as the Wicked Witch of the West is pinned to her other half!} Qxd4 19. Nxd4 {19. Nxd4 - Ion initiated the trade.} Bxg2 20. Kxg2 {20. Kxg2 - a trade of bishops immediately took place after the queen trade.} Rad8 21. Rad1 {21. Rad1 - centralising my QR as planned.} Kf6 22. f4 {22. f4 - to hold back e5.} Rd6 {22. ....... Rd6 - Ion is gonna double up on the d column.} 23. Nf3 {23. Nf3 - and I move my horsie off it!} Rfd8 24. Rxd6 Rxd6 {24. .... Rxd6 - rook trade.} 25. Kf2 {25. Kf2 - I want to trade off the final pair of rooks and put myself in an endgame with Ion.  I have to tread carefully though else Ion's horse could spring to c3 via e4 and fork Henry and the rook.  Nevertheless Henry moves towards the centre.} Ke7 26. Re2 {26. Re2 - step 2.} a5 27. Ke1 {27. Ke1 - step 3.} h6 28. Rd2 f6 29. Rxd6 Kxd6 {29. ....... Kxd6 - the rooks now come off and I have my endgame.} 30. Nd2 Kd5 31. Nc4 {31. Nc4?! - this move was just sooo tempting.  I should have perhaps played Ke2 here centralising Henry but the attack on the b6 pawn was for me a moth to the flame.} Nxa4 {31. ...... Nxa4 - The moth gets burned.  The pawn on b3 is overloaded, defending the c4 knight from the BK and defending a4.  Ion's knight defends the pawn on b6.  If 32. bxa4?? I will be in a K & P ending a clear pawn down.  There is a way to regain the lost material though.  I analysed it and then set up some conditional moves.} 32. Ne3+ Kd4 33. Ng4 {33. Ng4 - forking the black f and h pawns, I must win back one of them.} f5 34. Nxh6 {34. Nxh6 - the h pawn falls.  Material is even but Ion has the more active king which is very favourable indeed in an endgame.} Nc3 35. Nf7 {35. Nf7 - maybe Kd2 was preferable here.} Ne4 36. Kd1 Kc3 37. Kc1 {37. Kc1 - I inch Henry towards the queenside because Ion may trade pawns creating a passer on the a column which could be very nasty if Henry cannot get to a1.} Nd2 38. Ne5 {38. Ne5 - attacking the g6 pawn.} b5 {38. ....... b5.  Here I wave the white flag.  Here is an exerpt from my resignation note to Ion. Variation A 39. Nc6 a4, 40. bxa4 bxa4. 41. Na5 a3 42. Nb3 Nxb3+ 43. cxb3 Kxb3 44. Kb1 a2+ 45. Ka1 Kc2 46. Kxa2 Kd2 47. Kb3 Ke2 48. Kc4 Kf2 49. Kc5 Kg2 50. Kd6 Kxh2 51. Kxe6 Kxg3 52. Kf6 Kxf4 53. Kxg6 Kg4 54. Kf6 f4 - the f pawn will crown.  Variation B 39. Nxg6 a4 40. bxa4 bxa4 41. h4 a3 42. h5 a2 43. h6 a1=Q#.  But Ion sent me a pm.  Here is the excerpt from it.  Thanks for the game. Now, I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. I'm not altogether sure that Black is winning at all in the final position (after 38...b5). I'm not even sure my 38th move was the best! I did like it enough to play it "on screen", but you had a reasonable response in 39.Nc6 and if 39...a4? 40.Na7!  I probably would have had to try 39....Nf3 40.Nxa5 Nxh2 and maybe I would have had the edge.  So the only thing I did wrong here was to overlook the saver 40. Na7!.  I suppose the one consolation I have here is that it is one of my better efforts against Coach Ion.  Ah well, better luck next time!}
