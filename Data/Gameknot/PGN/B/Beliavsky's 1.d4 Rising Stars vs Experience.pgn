1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 {A sign of Queen Indian Defence, by fianchetto-ed a bishop to b7.} 4. a3 Ba6 {But instead Caruana goes the Bishop to a6, attacking c4 pawn. In a limited Chessbase Light 2007, I found no win by Black side via this opening.} 5. Qc2 {Protecting the pawn with Queen instead of b3.} Bb7 6. Nc3 c5 7. e4 {White come to standard three centered pawns.} cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bc5 9. Nb3 Be7 {Looks like a wasted tempo by Black here. 9..Nc6 is probably still in opening book. But Black maybe want to keep his Bishop pair.} 10. Bf4 d6 11. Rd1 O-O 12. e5 Nh5 13. Be3 Bg5 {with Rook eyeing an open file in d, maybe 13..d5 14.cxd5  exd5 15.Be2 g6 15.Nxd5 Bxd5 17.Bf3 is better. } 14. Qc1 {14.exd6 Bxe3 15.fxe3 Nf6  16.Qf2 } Bxe3 15. Qxe3 Nc6 16. Rxd6 {White is now a pawn up, 16.exd6 Qf6 17.Be2 Nf4 18.Bf3 Rfd8 with White d pawn strongly stand near promotion line.} Qh4 17. Rd7 Rab8 18. g3 Qg4 19. h3 {the Black's Queen is suddenly a good target to attack and White gain some Kingside improvement.} Qf5 20. Rxb7 {Removing the QID Bishop and Beliavsky starts the nice tactical middle game here.} Rxb7 21. Bg2 {Forcing the Black rook to c7 square, with two Knights and nearby enemy Major pieces, White is eyeing a fork by these two knights.} Rc7 22. Bxc6 f6 {Can't take the Bishop because of Knight fork at d4.} 23. Be4 Qxe5 {White is superior in space control and Black should be carefull retreting his Queen.} 24. f4 Qd6 25. Nb5 {And that's it White get his long awaited target, Black resign to see a loss exchange. 1-0.}
