1. d4 {My second rated benoni  on gameknot} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 {All very classical} 4. d5 exd5 {That's not the main line and probably not the best for black. I should have plaid g6} 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 {Now we go back to classical benoni } g6 {preparing the fiancheto} 7. f4 Bg7 {Still classical line for benoni} 8. Bb5+ Nfd7 {Mistake (I wanted to menace the knight)} 9. a4 a6 {Mistake, black should have castle} 10. Be2 {Mistake, GK computer "prefers" 10. Bd3} Qe7 {Dangerous but the rooks are far away. it will take at least 4 moves for white to  bring one on the e file} 11. Qc2 Nf6 {Now black's plan is to deal with the e pawn as soon as possible. But the knight goes back to the place it was before the 8th move...} 12. Nf3 {So that white can castle} O-O {logical move} 13. O-O Re8 {Now the king is safe, let's attack the central white pawns} 14. Bd3 {To defend the pawn} Bg4 {I see no way to directly attack the e pawn but a sequence is possible attacking directly the king. I think I can at least obtain a draw (which would not be so bad with black against a player rated 100 points more) and may be a win, although I do not see the winning sequence.} 15. Rb1 {It seems that white didn't foresee the sequence black is about to drive} Bxf3 {To launch his attack, black needs to get rid of the knight (the DSB shall come on d4)} 16. Rxf3 {Logical} Ng4 {Freeing the DSB and menacing h2 } 17. h3 {menacing the knight} Bd4+ 18. Kh1 {White had little choice (if  18. Kf1 Nh2+ and the rook on f3 is lost.)} Qh4 {Mate menace (by 19. Qe1)} 19. Bd2 {Preventing the mate.} Nf2+ {Black can only obtain the draw, } 20. Kh2 Ng4+ 21. Kh1 Nf2+ 22. Kh2 Ng4+ 23. Kh1 Nf2+ 24. Kh2 Ng4+ {Draw. }
