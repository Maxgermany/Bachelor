[Opening "KP (C20), Patzer opening"]

1. e4 {This is a game which I played against kraken during "karlo715's mini-tournament IX".  This game featured an opening which I had never seen before [Patzer (C20)], and this unfamiliarity caused me to play aggressively from the start. Furthermore I believe my inexperience with this opening threw my opponent off his game, causing the fatal 5.Qg5? mistake.} e5 2. Qh5 Qf6 {My reply to the opening was one that I thought would counter the opening well enough to get me through to the endgame. Post-game computer analysis disagrees and suggested Nc6 instead.} 3. g4 Bc5 {After 3.g4, I decided that since my Queen was out, to threaten scholar's mate, thus breaking his tempo by forcing a defensive move. 4. f3 would have been enough to counter this, after which I would accept the exchange and continue to gain a pawn in material. 4... Bxg1 5.Rxg1 Qxf3.   } 4. Nh3 g6 {This reply was not what I expected, and it seemed to me that my opponent would then play Ng5 to put pressure on the f7 pawn. I decided to break this pressure by trapping the queen, forcing her capture during the next turn. I saw the response 5.Qg5, which I thought to be safe for the white queen...} 5. Qg5 Bxf2+ {Until I saw the reply Bxf2+, which effectively captures it by forcing 6.Nxf2 Qxg5, or put my opponent in a Mate in 4 position. } 6. Kd1 {This is the fatal blunder that cost my opponent the game. Wanting to save his queen, he overlooked the forced mate. 6.Kd1?? Qf3+ 7.Be2 Qxh1+ 8.Ng1 Qxg1+ 9.Bf1 Qxf1#} Qf3+ 7. Be2 Qxh1+ 8. Bf1 Qxf1# {I took the edge on the 3.g4? move, which precipitated the loss of one of his minor pieces, or in the worst case scenario the loss of his queen. If 4.Nh3 denied me the acquisition of one of his pawns, it was a fatal move, because of the now certain capture of his queen. I don't know what caused my opponent to overlook these scenarios, but am now fairly certain it was because of my 2... Qf6, which he probably never had seen before, making him blunder into 3.g4?.   I thought this would be a game that would be nice to annotate, because it is one that made me think very hard, called for creativity in the opening instead of a memorized one  and it would demonstrate the danger of using uncommon openings, as the responses are not all given, forcing some blunders early into the game that can be fatal. }
