1. e4 e5 {Classical King pawn opening. } 2. Bc4 {I feel like a Bishops opening. } Nf6 {Allowing me to play for my favorite gambit. } 3. Nf3 {Offering e4 for the gambit. } Nxe4 {Gambit accepted. } 4. Nc3 {Continuing the gambit. } Nxc3 {Fully accepted. } 5. dxc3 {And so begins the journey into the Boden-Kieseritsky Bishop Gambit. } Nc6 {? Missing the threat to f7. Alternative variation: 5... f6 } 6. Ng5 {! With the idea of Bxf7+ } f5 {!? The text move looks odd, but it prepares ...f4 to cut off the bishop and threaten the knight. } 7. Bf7+ {The attack begins by forcing the king to walk. } Ke7 8. Qd5 {!? Adds protection to the bishop, closes on the king. } f4 {! A good move which prevents tactics against the king - queen alignment by the bishop, like (9.Nxh7 Rxh7 10.Bg5+ !) } 9. O-O {! Activates the rook and enables a possible future pin against e5. } h5 {?! ...h6 } 10. Re1 {Activates the pin. } Kf6 {Breaks the pin and attacks the hanging knight. } 11. h4 {! Saves the knight, takes control of g5, maintains positional control. } d6 {Activates the bishop, controls f5, adds a piece for defense. } 12. Ne4+ {!? Forces a king walk, idea of drawing the king away from defensive forces. } Kf5 13. Ng3+ {! Offers the knight to gain a mate. Its not forced, but it opens up possibilities. Bad of course is (13...fxg3 14.Qf3#) } Kg4 {?! Chasing after a pawn, but ...Kf6 seems a safer alternative. } 14. Be6+ {!? Attempting a positional swindle, which if not accepted still presents problems for the king. } Bxe6 {Accepted. I feel encouraged. } 15. Qxe6+ {++/- Black is now completely lost. } Kxh4 {Forced, no other square, no blocking. } 16. Ne4 {! There is no escape for the king now. White enables g3+ again, this time with fatal consequences for black. } Qd7 {Desperation. } 17. g3+ {! No need to worry about the queens because the following moves lead to mate by pawn. } fxg3 18. fxg3# {An unexpectedly fast win against the computer. I was happy to have a chance to try another idea in the Boden-Kiereritsky Gambit with (6.Ng5!), where before I had played (6.Qd5!?). I like the variation played in this game better. }
