1. d4 {Just a reminder about the time control. It was 40 moves in 90 minutes, after that an extra 30 minutes is added if your time runs out. There is also an increment of 30 seconds per move.} d6 {This was a surprise. My opponent - the number 5 seed in the tournament, and a FIDE Master - the first I have ever played to my knowledge - has played the Benko Gambit.} 2. e4 {And this surprised him, as d4 player he was not expecting me to allow a transposition to a e4 opening.} Nf6 {The Pirc Defence (correctly pronounced "peerts", but often mispronounced "perk"), sometimes known as the Ufimtsev Defence or Yugoslav Defence, is a chess opening characterised by Black responding to 1.e4 with 1...d6 and 2...Nf6, followed by ...g6 and ...Bg7, while allowing White to establish an impressive-looking centre with pawns on d4 and e4. It is named after the Slovenian Grandmaster Vasja Pirc.} 3. Nc3 {The usual reply.} c6 {Slightly unusual - black normally plays g6 here.} 4. Bd3 {No point in going to c4 where it can be hit with b7-b5} e5 {Black stakes a claim in the centre.} 5. Nge2 {And this is the usual reply} b5 {I can't see this move on any of my databases, and I don't think it is very good! Too many pawn moves! Nb-d7, Be7, g6, exd4, Qc7 and Qb6 have all been played here.} 6. f3 {The setup f2â€“f3, Be3 and Qd2 is commonly used against the King's Indian Defence and Dragon Sicilian, and can also be used against the Pirc; indeed, this system is as old as the Pirc itself.} h5 {Another strange pawn move. Again, I think Nb-d7, Be7, g6, exd4, Qc7 and Qb6 are all better.} 7. Bg5 {Maybe I should have continued with my plan of Be3, but I almost felt duty bound to try and exploit his weakening of the g5 square and the fact he couldn't play h7-h6 any more.} Be7 {He at last develops.} 8. Qd2 {And I continue.} a6 {Maybe he was planning c6-c5.} 9. dxe5 {I exchanged as I was afraid of him exchanging on d4 followed by c6-c5-c4} dxe5 {He takes back.} 10. Nd1 {I decide to re-route my knight to e3 and I was thinking about strengthening my centre with c2-c3.} Be6 {He develops.} 11. Ne3 {Heading for f5.} g6 {He stops Nf5.} 12. a4 {Attacking before he catches up fully on development.} Nbd7 {He develops.} 13. axb5 {I take.} axb5 {He takes back.} 14. O-O {And I castle.} Rc8 {He can't play 14.....Nxe4 immediately as I had 15. Bxe4 Bxg5 16. Bxc6 so he protects c6, threatening Nxe4!} 15. Qe1 {The plan is to follow up with Qh4 at some stage, but it may be a losing mistake! 15. Qa5 was called for, with equality.} Qb6 {Pinning the knight.} 16. Kh1 {Unpinning the knight! OK stop and work out black's next move!} Ng4 {A brilliant move, which I hadn't seen. Black doesn't win any material, but gains the two bishops, most importantly he gains my good dark squared bishop, and he has more active pieces.} 17. Nxg4 {I take.} Bxg5 {He takes back.} 18. Nf2 {The only safe square for the knight.} O-O {He finally castles.} 19. Nc3 {I am not sure if the knight is any better places here.} Rca8 {Contesting the a file.} 20. Qe2 {Uniting the rooks.} Be3 {With the threat of taking on a1 followed by taking on f2 - or indeed vice versa.} 21. Kg1 {An unusual self pin!} Kg7 {Black is in control. He masterly improves the position of his king before doing anything.} 22. Rfe1 {I hit his bishop} Bd4 {It retreats.} 23. Qd2 {I prevent him from doubling my pawns - although is that really a threat?} Ra7 {He starts to double on the a file.} 24. Kf1 {I unpin my knight.} Rfa8 {He doubles his rooks.} 25. Rxa7 {I exchange.} Rxa7 {He takes back.} 26. Nh1 {I can stop worrying about him taking on f2 now.} b4 {I was rather expecting h5-h4 preventing Ng3.} 27. Nd1 {Protecting b2.} Ra2 {Attacking b2.} 28. Ng3 {I am hoping he would give up his strong bishop to gain a pawn here.} Qd8 {Instead he correctly plays this.} 29. Ne2 {I continue my plan. 29. Qxb4 loses to Qh4 } Bc5 {He correctly keeps his good bishop.} 30. Ng1 {Maybe Nc1 was better? What do you think dear reader?} Nb6 {He improves the position of his knight.} 31. Qe2 {Preventing Nc4.} Qd4 {Threatening mate on g1.} 32. Qf2 {Which I have to stop.} Qxf2+ {He takes.} 33. Nxf2 {I take back.} Rxb2 {He finally wins this pawn. It is very instructive how he didn't hurry to win this pawn, and calmly improved the position of his pieces first.} 34. Ra1 {Hoping for counter-play along the a file and/or trapping his rook on b2.} Nc4 {The knight comes in.} 35. Nd1 {Attacking his rook.} Ne3+ {Knight check.} 36. Nxe3 {I take.} Bxe3 {He takes back.} 37. Ne2 {This knight pops out.} c5 {Threat - c4 winning the bishop.} 38. Nc1 {Creating room for my bishop.} c4 {He hits it anyway. } 39. Be2 {It retreats.} Rxc2 {A second pawn drops. He is threatening to take my knight now.} 40. Na2 {This is its only square.} b3 {White resigns. I can't stop his b pawn from queening.
