[Opening "King's Indian, 3.Nf3 (E60)"]

1. d4 {The queens pawn opening is my bread and butter. It takes you into slower, more closed off games, which are the type of games I've come to love. } Nf6 {A flexible move which watches over the e4 square and gives black still a lot of options. He's not committed to 1 specific opening just yet.} 2. c4 {Playing this, I was praying that the opponent wouldn't transpose into the benoni with c5. Not that the benoni is impossible to beat, but it starts off things far more quickly then I'd like and it has quite a lot of theory.} g6 {The King's Indian Defence, black commits himself with this move to a hypermodern defence. Can't say I face it too often, but it's a viable option for black. Here I was expecting him to transpose into the grünfeld defence. Not sure why, he just seemed like the sort of guy who'd play the grünfeld.} 3. Nf3 {Developing a knight, more common is Nc3, but this works too.} Bg7 4. Nc3 d5 {And now we're playing the grünfeld if memory serves me right.} 5. Bg5 {For whatever reason I was expecting e6, but black is perfectly fine delaying e6 or perhaps not even playing it at all. Bf4 was also an idea and perhaps slightly better. That being said, it's not too bad.} c6 {Defending the pawn, it blocks off the knight of the natural square c6, but openings like the slav have proven time in time again that this isn't really a problem. He'll develop it via Nd7.} 6. cxd5 {Looking back at it, I'm not sure why I traded. Probably to try and simplify the position a bit and in the future take a stab at b7 and d5 with Qb3. That idea still needs A LOT of work, but you never know in these type of elo's.} Nxd5 {I think recapturing with the pawn would have been better, since now I have e4 with tempo. His knight doesn't have a good square except f6 so either he trades with my knight or he moves back to f6. This is more or less handing me the center.} 7. e4 {What's it gonna be?} Nxc3 8. bxc3 {Surprisingly he chooses for this option. Black gets counterplay via Qa5 pinning the c pawn, but if white manages to hold on to the center he'll have a very good game.} Qa5 {A good move, which immediately complicates things due to his bishop attacking the a1-h8 file. It also indirectly puts pressure on my previously good bishop, which now doesn't look quite as amazing anymore.} 9. Qd2 {This move took me a few minutes, since I was considering moving my bishop to d2 and then following up with something along the lines of c4. I figured that might be a bit too ambitious, this defends the c-file and protects the a2 pawn so my rook can maybe target down the b-file or support the center in the near future. This comes at the cost of my bishop being unable to go back to c1 or d2 and maybe target the other side of the board, but considering his queen is there, I highly doubt that'd be a good idea anyway. If he chases my bishop with pawns, I'll respond with Bf4 -> Bg3.} c5 {dxc5 or d5 aren't options since Bxc3 means game over. This move took me a few minutes to find as well.} 10. Rc1 {cxd4 is met with Nxd4. If black wishes to get rid of the knight on d4 he'll have to give his bishop for it or play d5. Both ideas are unappealing since e5 indirectly blocks the a1-h8 diagonal and trading literally destroys the last bit of development he had. The plan in which he trades his bishop makes me lose my right to castle after 2 or 3 moves, but I doubt black will be able to take advantage of that since he'll be underdeveloped and have no pressure on the center.} Nc6 {Developing and putting more pressure. Sadly for him the c3 issue is solved so I can put some pressure on it.} 11. d5 Ne5 {We have a saying over here which would roughly translate to the following. "When you say A, you got to say B." The diagonal is obstructed once more. That being said, that knight isn't going to be there for long.} 12. Nxe5 {I don't want him to trade and create a double pawn on the f-file. I might have plans of castling in the future and this would eliminate that possibility.} Bxe5 {Kind of forced to take back the material.} 13. f4 {This move had me thinking for over 10 minutes. I dislike this type of aggressive play and it blocks off a route for my bishop, but it gets me a tempo and if I get e5 of at the right timing then black can more or less resign. A plan like Bc4 -> Bb3 -> O-O doesn't' look too unappealing, albeit a bit slow.} Bg7 {Retreating to the other diagonal offers future to the bishop, but it'd take a few moves. Moves which the opponent doesn't really have time for anymore.} 14. Be2 {Bc4 isn't bad, but it could be targeted down.  I'd rather not give him even the slightest bit of counter play. The plan was to put the bishop on f3 if things do end up going at a slower pace and then targeting down that diagonal after an e5 push. Maybe eventually create a discovered attack.} Bd7 {He finally gets the chance to develop this thing, though it doesn't really contribute a lot just quite yet. At the very least he's closer to connecting the rooks now so that they can coöperate to try and stop this mayhem.} 15. c4 {Solidifying the position. I felt like I didn't really need castling anymore as long as moving my king connects the rooks. Maybe it's not the best idea to trade off a queen which has such a huge role in my attack, but I felt like I'd be alright. b5 is a slight concern in the distant future, but if that were to happen trading gives my rook on c1 a semi-open file and his pawn on c5 will become troublesome to defend.} Qc7 {This is the first move on which he thought longer then 5 minutes. I had used about 45 minutes compared to his 25 minutes. He probably felt like he wouldn't be able to hang on without his queen. I'm about to do something stupid though.} 16. Bxe7 {Optimistic in my dominant position, I thought he couldn't take my bishop since d6 follows. Right after I hit the clock my heart dropped. I started stressing whereas he started nodding his head as if he had just seen a gift granted to him by the gods themselves. Turns out it isn't quite that easy though.} Kxe7 {I was about to resign here, when it suddenly hits me that this really isn't as easy for black as you'd think. d6 isn't possible quite yet, but the threat still exists. So e5  makes that threat a reality. A reality he must respond to and just about none of the obvious responses are easy to play.} 17. e5 {I threaten d6. Moving his king away is the first instinct a lot of players have, but it leads to a difficult game. Example: 17 e5 Kd8 18. e6 Qc8. Essentially the problem for black is that activating his queen won't be easy anymore. You could do it via 18. ... Qc6 19.Bf3 Qa4. But then the queen won't be there to help defend anything. White has threats such as f5, which  you can't really stop. It leads to Qg5 check and eventually possibly to checkmate.  The only way to prevent Qg5 is h6 or Qd7 ( implying you haven't moved her to a4 like previously explained ), but that gets met by f6. Eventually I'll force my way into e6 and both sides have a long game with long calculations ahead of them. This all took me a while to calculate, but I suddenly found a glimmer of hope. If black messes up even once he's done for.} Bxe5 {My opponent's smile became bleaker and bleaker as time passed by when he came up with this move. This move took him 15 minutes of thinking and marked the first time he had less time then me on the clock. I guess he calculated just how difficult the game would be if he were to move his king or queen so he avoids it entirely by offering back the material. It stops my previously impressive attack right in its tracks. I gotta give props to black here, sure I screwed up, but technically speaking he did stop my pawnstorm.} 18. fxe5 Qxe5 {Black is a pawn up but white has a passed d pawn. I'm kind of bummed out since my attack of earlier got nullified, but unlike those superGM's we tend to screw up. This game isn't over just yet.} 19. Rc3 {The plan is obvious. Move the rook to e3 and win the queen. Sadly this isn't junior chess camp, people don't fall for tricks this obvious.} Kd6 {Moving out of the way. His target is Qa1. I forgot this was a plan for him, but I figure the reason i forgot was because I unconsciously knew I had Bd1 as a defence. Yeah let's go with that excuse for not noticing.} 20. Re3 {Creating pressure.} Qa1+ {I missed this move.  There are doomscenarios playing in the back of my head because i realy really don't want to play Qd1. Then I noticed my questionable bishop on e2. This bishop will end up contributing a large role in my eventual victory.} 21. Bd1 Rae8 {He's up a pawn so he wants to trade. Fair enough.} 22. O-O {Getting rid of the pin on Bd1 with possible discovered attacks by moving this bishop. At the same time I'm also pressuring f7.} Rxe3 23. Qxe3 {Fair enough, now he has a few options.  f5, which is in my opinion probably the best option, being greedy and gobbling up the pawn on a2 which leads to a scary Qf4+. Or moving his queen away to avoid the shenanigans. Note added later on: For those interested, I looked at what would have happened if Qxa2 would have been played. Qxa2 loses for black in every single combination except for 1 in which it draws due to repetition. Reason being because after I force his king all the way back to f8, I'm able to just capture his bishop. It's still a rocky road from there, but black was correct not to take it.   } Qd4 {Black wants to trade pieces since he's ahead. This move accomplishes that since it's forced. If the pawn were to get on d4, then moving his king to c5 will became rather difficult to defend against.} 24. Qxd4 cxd4 {Black has good chances here, but don't count out white yet. White could play Bb3 and try his hand at that kind of play while calmly chasing down the pawn on d4. } 25. Rxf7 {Winning back the pawn. making a pawn storm on the right side far less scary.  Moving the rook also means h7 falls. The pawn on d4 isn't that easy to promote if your pieces can't reach it. I plan moves of Kf2, moving towards the d4 pawn.} Re8 {You know those moments where you literally hear angels singing hallelujah because something good happened? This move is exactly that since it wins white the game. It's an easy puzzle but after a 3 hour game of chess and the stress of watching your attack crumble? Try to find the winning move in under 30 seconds as a challenge.} 26. Rxd7+ {Recapturing is sort of forced. Moving the king away just straight out loses.} Kxd7 27. Ba4+ {He can't abandon the e8 square and at this point that smile of his disappeared altogether and turned into a face of horror. I kind of felt bad for the poor guy since he's gonna lose the d4 pawn due to this. Recapturing on e8 means his king will be too far away to protect d4.  } Ke7 28. Bxe8 Kxe8 {Minimum amount of moves needed for the white king to get to d3 or e4: 3 Moves for the black king to get to c5: 3.} 29. Kf2 b6 {He realises he's too late. The only way he'd get to the d4 square in 3 moves is via Kd7 -> Kd6 -> Kc5 and if I were to play c5 as soon as he does that he can't reach c5 anymore, meaning he'd have to walk all the way around to e5. b6 stops the c5 idea, but it's too late for the pawn on d4.} 30. Ke2 Kd7 31. Kd3 Kd6 32. Kxd4 a6 {Black can resign here. White can just block all the pawns and start pushing his d pawn. If for whatever reason white needs to give black a tempo in 10 or so moves he can do this by what I believe is called triangulation which forces a zugzwang. Something I studied in the past. Therefore black is hopelessly lost. He continues playing just to see if I were to screw up. The next moves which should be so obvious are gonna take him 45 minutes of thinking. Does he hope I screw up or does he actually not realise black can't win here if played correctly?} 33. a3 h6 34. h4 g5 35. hxg5 hxg5 36. g4 {And the ball is back in Black's court.} b5 {2 options here. Push or take. I decided for option B. I think pushing wins faster, but since I'm a grandmaster in making mistakes in the endgame I decide to take. Since it seems less complex. Black won't be able to play b4 and eventually I'll win the b5 pawn.} 37. cxb5 axb5 38. Ke4 {He can only move backwards} Kd7 39. Ke5 Ke7 40. d6+ Kd7 41. Kd5 Kd8 {Almost there.} 42. Kc6 {Preparing to take on b5 and make the endgame so easy even I can't possibly screw it up anymore.} Ke8 {Forced.} 43. Kxb5 Kd7 44. Kc5 Kd8 45. a4 {Could have played Kc6. Doesn't really matter anymore, not much black can do.} Kc8 46. Kc6 Kd8 47. d7 {This move took me 2 minutes to make, I think I checked like 50 times wether or not he had a flight square or not. He resigns. With this win I end my opponent's 17 win-streak, so he's probably higher rated then 1590 as soon as the elo updates at the end of the season. In this game I played in a style which was not like what I'm used to, namely I took a more aggressive approach. That being said, I'm interested to see what would have happened had he accepted the bishop without giving back material. My chessteam did end up losing overall, which wasn't unexpected. It's what usually happens when the opponents weakest player is stronger then our strongest player. Board 3 lost after just 15 minutes due to insufficent openingpreparation and board 2 simply was outmatched. Seeing how I was winning, board 1 got offered a draw since they wanted to secure the overall win. They are 1 out of 2 teams battling it out for promotion and having a tie with us would destroy that possiblity. Considering our board 1 player was slightly behind ( even material, but he had more exploitable weaknesses ) he accepted without second thought. }
