[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {I generally go with 1.e4, it's just a personal preference.  Lately my game's been undergoing a transition and this allows me to build a nice pawn chain or stonewall, which I find works well for me.  All sorts of possibilities with this one, a simple book move.} e5 {Nothing strange here.} 2. Nf3 {I often like to play Scotch Game, as it leads to some sort of a brawl, and this is setting up for that.  This can also lead to a Philidor Defense, which I like playing as both White or Black.  (This may explain my firm patzer status.)  Anyway, simple enough here.} f6 {This one seems to be an effort by Black to keep play out of the center, and it's not a particularly good move.  I had not seen Damiano played for a long time, and no wonder - I hesitate to call it bad, but it gives White advantage.} 3. Bc4 {This is a common and strong response, Horowitz suggests a line with 3. Bc4 that leads to strong White advantage.  3. Nxe5! is considered a better move, but I figured here that if Black wanted a quiet, defensive game, I'd give it to him and develop my defense while I was at it.} Ne7 {This seems to be a move for the sake of movement.  I cannot find much defense for it.  True, it does take the knight out of the bishop's line of attack, but there is no reason to take the knight at that point.  It also protects the king, but the king is still in a relatively secure position and this doesn't bolster kingside defense terribly well.  In addition, it stifles the queen and black-square bishop.  Not terribly good.} 4. d3 {The beginning of a pawn formation.  In addition, it opens up movement for White's black-squared bishop.  It also offers some defense for the bishop and asserts some control over the center.  Perhaps a little stifling but not bad.} d6 {Not the worst move here.  Allows the white-squared bishop to get out and gives the queen a bit of breathing room.  Probably better than 4...d5, which could lead to white control of the center or the queen being exposed early.} 5. Be3 {Developing.  It puts the bishop in the center of the board and begins to set up for queenside castling, if so desired.} Bg4 {This is aggressive move.  It pins the knight to the queen and (finally) develops a piece past the second rank.  This can be easily countered, but not intrinsically bad.} 6. Nc3 {This is more development, entrenching White's defense of the center and giving it a strong claim the the d5 square.  This move could have been used to threaten the bishop of g4, but not bad here.} a6 {This one is purely to set up for 7...b5, attacking the bishop.} 7. h3 {Here, possibly a move late but there at any rate, is the attack on the bishop, forcing it to retreat and leaving White's center intact (or to trade the bishop for the knight).} Nbc6 {Not a bad development.  This begins to set up for an attack on the center or the queenside, although any attack is rather far off.} 8. Nd5 {This one is a threatening move more than anything.  White is inviting Black to trade knights, which would put White's bishop at d5 and, given that no threats are forthcoming, give it domination over the board.  If such a trade is rejected, this cramps Black's style (not to mention his position) in the middle of the board, with the c7, e7 and f6 squares all attacked.} Bxf3 {Black comes back to his threatened bishop and decides to exchange it.  I might give this move as "Bxf3?" because, with White's pawn at e4 and bishop at c4 (and possibly moving to d5 soon), White controls many of the white squares and the loss of his white-square bishop gives Black a disadvantage, particularly as the scope of the knight he captured was limited by Black's decent pawn wedge and it was not defending any major square or piece.} 9. Qxf3 {This is basically forced, though the queen capture is rather better than capturing with the g-pawn.  A capture with the g-pawn is rather questionable, as it doubles pawns on the f-file,  leaves the g-file quite vulnerable, and accomplishes little (g4 is already defended by the h-pawn and could be bolstered much better by moving the g-pawn there).  This move does move the queen out, but to a relatively safe spot devoid of much serious threat from Black.} h6 {Setting up for an attack on the queen and generally kingside.  Black is probably preparing for 10...g5,  though this pawn formation is somewhat problematic as it traps Black's remaining bishop away from the action.  In addition, the move allows a direct checkmate, which Black, if he is committed to the g5 move, should defend against first.} 10. g4 {Perhaps not the best move, as it does limit the scope of the Queen, but not bad.  It counter's Black's impending stonewall and constructs one of White's own.} g5 {Of course Black has a one-track mind here.  He presses on with his stonewall formation, which is actually not terrible in and of itself.  However, Black has neglected to move his bishop out, which basically traps it.  In addition, the placement of the knight on e7 and the previous placement of the pawn on g7 has kept the bishop and queen in their original positions and blocks them in, which leaves the f6 pawn undefended and opens up to the next move.  Disaster.  A terrible blunder, literally the worst possible move on the board, since it leads to...} 11. Nxf6# {Nxf6#.  I did not believe I was actually watching this when I saw 10...g5?? played.  Had this been over an actual board, I think it likely that "nicendnaughty" (the actual username of the player I had been playing blitz with on a different site) would have let his naughty side out and flipped the board over.  I had not played badly up to this point, and felt I had a decent position, but of course here was a chance to checkmate.  Much as I like a good game of chess, the object is winning, and I am not one to pass up a mate-in-one opportunity should I see.  (Often I don't see it until later - this is blitz, after all, but I don't have a 1052 rating on that site for nothing.)  Have a good laugh at this one.}
