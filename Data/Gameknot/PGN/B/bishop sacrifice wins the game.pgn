1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. e3 e5 4. Bb5 Bd7 5. Nf3 e4 {i make mistake and white takes control at centre, with nice move with Ne5} 6. Ne5 Nf6 {i decline to defend c6 despite it will make my pawn structure weak} 7. Nxc6 {of course he attacks} Bxc6 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. f3 Bb4 {i continue with development, thinking that Rb8 will win in future... } 10. Qd2 Rb8 11. a3 Ba5 12. b4 Bb6 13. fxe4 {white starts attack and gains control in middle} Nxe4 14. Nxe4 dxe4 15. Qf2 O-O 16. Qf5 {e4 is my best positioned pawn and i need it, so Qe7 is my best option} Qe7 17. Rf1 g6 18. Qg4 {i was thinking about f5 followed by Qf6 and than a little trap on c5 aiming for the rook on a1... but} f5 19. Qf4 c5 {this is where i knew my only chance is.... enable rook a b-line and queen c-line with good move on Qc3... but his Bb2 with queen on black would win the game, but...} 20. bxc5 Bxc5 21. dxc5 Qxc5 {he accepts sacrifice.... rest is history} 22. Kd1 {he tries tosave rook on a1} Qc3 23. Ra2 Rb1 {and he enables me beautifull attack on Rb1} 24. Qg5 {and than good chance on Qc4 attacking both undefended rooks} Qc4 25. Rxf5 {no comment needed} Rxf5 26. Qd8+ Rf8 27. Qd4 Rf1+ {and than usual mate in 2.... could have played Qf1 but he would Kd2 - Rf2; Kc3 and he would avoid mate and checked me on Qd8 - Kg7; Qd7 - Kh6, Qh3... it would be boring} 28. Kd2 Rf2+ 29. Kd1 Qf1# {i hope u enyojed}
