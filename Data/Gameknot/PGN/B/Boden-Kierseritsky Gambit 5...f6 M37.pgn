1. e4 {This game is a trial by fire of the alternative move (5...f6). I had to find out if this move can refute the gambit. I present the following game with my strategic ideas for your enjoyment.} e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nxe4 4. Nc3 Nxc3 5. dxc3 {This completes the moves needed to produce the BKG. } f6 {Here is seen the (5...f6) alternative move. The computer typically likes to play ...Nc6, but I make it play the text move so I can have some fun with this variation of the Boden-Kierseritsky Gambit. } 6. O-O {Activates the rook. White has 5 active pieces vs black who has almost 2 active pieces. } c6 {!? An interesting move with the idea of ...d5 to follow. This creates a strong center, or is it? Pawns chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Note the expansive pawn structure that follows. } 7. b4 {!? Sure, you are thinking what kind of a dumb move is that? It does nothing to challenge ...d5? I made this move based on intuition and because it can be used to break the pawn chain later by b4-b5, and it prevents ...Bc5, denying the bishop a centralized position. } d5 {Expected. } 8. Bb3 {The text move maintains the bishop on its best attacking line and allows for a later c4, which if follows ...0-0, becomes a very useful move. } Be7 {...0-0 is expected. } 9. Nh4 {!? Opens a queen line, pushes the knight towards an expected castle, and can possibly entice a bad move like ...g5 creating an ever increasing amount of luft around the king. Threatens Qh5+ where if ...g6 then Nxg6 wins a pawn. } O-O {Blissfully unaware. } 10. f4 {! Breaking the chain. Its not obvious how good this move really is until it is taken in context of the following moves. } exf4 {?! Not forced, seems better to leave the tension. } 11. c4 {! Breaking the chain on the other flank, the central pawns are demolished. The threat of check is hanging. } Bxb4 {Gains material but misses the threat. } 12. cxd5 Bc5+ {A simpleton check. } 13. Kh1 Kh8 {?! Trying to avoid the bishop check, but stepping into tactics. } 14. Ng6+ {! A kicker of a move breaks down the castle walls. } hxg6 {Losing the rook may have been preferable. } 15. Rxf4 {Not just gain material, but threatening Rh4+ } f5 {!? A nice move that stops the immediate threat of Rh4+, but it has one disadvantage in that it blocks a bishop line. } 16. Qd3 {! With the threat of Qh3+ to be coupled with the move d5-d6 to open the bishop line to g8. } cxd5 {?! Not accomplishing anything. } 17. Bxd5 {Takes g8. } Be3 {Desperation. Prevents Qh3+ Qh4; Qxh4#, but only for a short time. } 18. Bxe3 {Black sacrificed the bishop to stay in the game, and now white has to find a good strategy to continue the attack correctly. } Nc6 {?? Too slow to attack the bishop. Does not contribute enough. Better is ..Qe7 with the idea of ...Be6. The move is a blunder because it throws away a crucial tempo. } 19. Bc5 {! The move is not just a simple attack on the rook. It is a crucial element in the following attack. } Be6 {Nothing can save black now. } 20. Qh3+ Kg8 21. Bxe6+ Rf7 {Forced. } 22. Rh4 Qxh4 {Forced, else its mate. } 23. Qxh4 Nd8 {And the rest is a matter of technique. } 24. Bb3 {Simplifying was also possible, but I really like a pin, and there is also the introduction of the rook to e8 for a nice mate to consider. } b6 25. Re1 {! } Ne6 26. Rxe6 {! Bxd6 was also possible, but I like the hidden threat of a revealed check - possible from this move. } bxc5 27. Re7 {With obvious threat. } Raf8 {Essential. } 28. Rxa7 {! Maintains the pin, enables Qe7. } f4 29. Qe7 c4 30. Bxc4 Kh7 {Breaks the pin. } 31. Bxf7 {Now is the right time. } Rxf7 {There was nothing better. } 32. Qxf7 Kh6 33. Qxf4+ g5 34. Qf7 g4 35. Qxg7+ Kh5 36. Ra5+ Kh4 37. Qf6# {So play against the variation (6...f6) seems viable. The method for attack just has to be changed, slowed down and repositioned. It is a nice variation which introduces more complexities into the position, which are a great challenge, but can have great rewards. This has to be one of the most intense games I have played where all the moves just seemed to work together really well. }
