1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 O-O {The starting position.} 9. b4 Be6 10. d3 a5 {A subtle error, as White now has a nice tactical sequence...} 11. b5 Nd4 12. Nxe5 {...that wins a Pawn.} Bf6 13. f4 {Now White returns the favor. By opening a diagonal to his King...} Nb3 14. Rb1 Qd4+ 15. Kh1 Qxc3 {...I have a tactical sequence that wins a piece.} 16. Bb2 Qc5 17. d4 Qxb5 {I get my Pawn back, too.} 18. e4 Rad8 19. d5 Bc8 {I have to retreat for the moment, as White is pressing to try and win back his material.} 20. Ba1 a4 {I really need to unpin this Knight, but for the moment I'll add a guard.} 21. Qh5 h6 22. Bf3 Qe8 {There, now it's unpinned. Now I need to drive back the gathering White attack on my King's position.} 23. Bc3 Nc5 {Time to bring this piece back towards the main theater of action.} 24. Bb4 Be7 25. g4 Ncd7 {If i can exchange off some pieces to lessen the force of the attack, I will.} 26. Bxe7 Qxe7 27. Nxd7 Qxd7 {I don't at all mind this swapping down.} 28. g5 Qh3 {I definitely want White's Queen gone.} 29. gxh6 Qxh5 30. Bxh5 gxh6 {Now White's tactical possibilities are cut down to size.} 31. f5 Nc4 32. Rf2 Ne5 {Blocking the potential Pawn surge.} 33. Rg1+ Kh7 34. Rc2 Rd7 35. Rcg2 Rdd8 {I'm hoping to be able to swap at least one pair of Rooks.} 36. Rc2 c6 37. dxc6 bxc6 {Some minor maneuvering opens the board a bit with the swap of Pawns.} 38. Rc5 f6 39. Ra5 Rd4 40. Ra7+ Bd7 {Attack and riposte.} 41. Bd1 Rg8 42. Bxa4 Rxe4 {More Pawns fall.} 43. Bxc6 Nxc6 44. Rxd7+ {That was a nice sequence by White to gain a Pawn.} Kh8 45. Rd6 Nd4 46. Rxg8+ Kxg8 47. Rxf6 {And another one, although he had to concede the exchange of a pair of Rooks to gain it.} Rf4 48. Rxh6 Nxf5 {Now White can be assured of a draw if he can succeed in removing the Rooks. With no Pawns left I decide to play for a draw.} 49. Ra6 Ne3 50. h3 Nc2 51. a4 Nb4 {The idea is to remove this Pawn with my Knight and then use my King and Rook to prevent the successful advance of White's last Pawn.} 52. Rb6 Kg7 53. Kg2 Rd4 54. a5 Re4 55. a6 Nxa6 {This had to be expected.} 56. Rxa6 {The game is now a book draw, but White insists on pressing me, hoping for a blunder.} Rh4 57. Kg3 Rh6 58. Ra5 Kg6 59. Kg4 Rh8 60. h4 Kh6 61. Ra6+ Kh7 62. h5 Rg8+ {The key. Once White moves his King to the QB file where it's cut off from his Pawn, it's all over but the shouting.} 63. Kf5 Kh8 64. Ra7 Rg7 {Once the Rooks come off the board White will be forced to concede that my defenses have held.} 65. Ra6 Kh7 66. Rg6 {Finally!} Rxg6 67. hxg6+ Kg7 68. Kg5 Kg8 {The most basic of defensive positions. There's no way to successfully force the Pawn through.} 69. Kf6 Kf8 70. Kf5 Kg7 71. Kg5 Kg8 {And White agrees to a draw.}
