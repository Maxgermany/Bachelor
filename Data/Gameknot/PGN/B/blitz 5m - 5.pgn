1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. b3 e5 4. Bb2 {Some sort of Danish opening.} d6 5. d3 Nf6 6. Nbd2 b5 7. Be2 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. h3 Be6 10. Nh2 {Starting to attack on the KingÂ´s side.} Qd7 11. f4 Bxh3 {Nice one! It may have compensation, at least, draw looks better than letting white do f5} 12. gxh3 Qxh3 13. Rf3 {Now traffic will not allow white to find a good defence. In this position I spent more time trying to find adequate spots for my defending pieces.} Qh4 14. Qe1 {Trying to exchange queens and simplify the position. Maybe f5 was stronger} Qh5 15. Rg3 Qh6 16. fxe5 {Now, this is a crucial point. Blocking with f5 instead of taking seemed safer, but on the other hand I also wanted to activate my bishop in b2.} Nxe5 {But also black activates his pieces} 17. Bxe5 dxe5 18. Ndf3 Nh5 19. Rg4 Nf4 20. Bf1 {AS mentioned, too much traffice here for white.} f5 {Excellent! Activating f-column. White looks worse and worse with every passing move.} 21. Rg3 fxe4 22. Qxe4 Bh4 {And rook is lost.} 23. Ng4 {Trying to fish something in the confusion of the blitz game.} Qe6 {To no avail. Well done, black!  kendefender 1:21  vs.	 sunil1234 	4:19  (o-1)  }
