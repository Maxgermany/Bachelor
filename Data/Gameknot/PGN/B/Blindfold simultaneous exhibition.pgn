1. e4 e5 2. f4 Bc5 {The gambit is refused this time.} 3. Nf3 d6 4. b4 {An uncharacteristic mistake by the pro.

Bc4 Nf6 {Black can answer 9 P-K5 with 9... P-Q4!} 9. Qd3 O-O 10. O-O Re8 {Both players have developed their King-side but not the Q-side.} 11. Nbd2 g6 12. f5 {The grandmaster tries to force an attack through. But with his Q-side undeveloped, the attack will lack sting.} d5 {Collapsing White's center.} 13. exd5 Bxf5 14. Qb3 Ng4 {Now the attack passes to Black.} 15. d6 Re3 16. Bxf7+ {A "spite check."} Kg7 17. Qc4 Bd3 {White resigns, as his KR will fall. A brilliant display of chess from the child.}
