1. e4 {Hi everyone, and again, welcome to gameknot, Amy!  During my break-time at work, a colleague of mine called Beverley mentioned that her daughter, Amy was learning how to play chess and had been taking part in some OTB junior tournaments.  I recommended gameknot to Beverley and she told Amy about it.  Amy logged on as snowbun and I challenged her to an unrated game to have some idea about what strength she was at.  So, she had her gameknot baptism with me.  She left a piece en prise very early on but played reasonably well after that.  Unfortunately for her I exchanged down so that she had no counterplay whatsoever and my extra piece made itself felt.  I increased my material advantage until she help-mated on move 37.  Gameknot analysis is on the following link:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15060312&rnd=0.6693379831140849. } e6 {1. ..... e6 - Amy decided to try the French Defense.} 2. Nf3 {2. Nf3 - I thought of the usual d4 but decided to develop a piece, namely my king knight.} Be7 3. d4 {3. d4 - after black's somewhat conservative choice I then followed up with d4.} Nc6 4. d5 exd5 5. exd5 {5. exd5 - pawn trade.} Na5 6. Bd2 {6. Bd2 - development with a threat against the knight on a4.} Nc4 {6. ...... Nc4?? - Amy walks her knight straight into the path of Fou Leblanc who reads the last rites to it.  Not only am I a clear piece up but am ahead in development.  6...... b6 would have prevented the loss of the knight.} 7. Bxc4 Nf6 8. O-O O-O 9. Nc3 {9. Nc3 - Amy has managed to catch up a bit in development but still needs to develop her light square bishop.} b6 10. Re1 Re8 11. Bg5 {11. Bg5 - when material up, trade pieces not pawns.  If you are a piece up you certainly do not want to exchange pawns because a king and minor piece cannot checkmate a bare king in the endgame.} Ng4 {11. ...... Ng4 - this move invites a series of trades where I will remain a clear piece up.} 12. Bxe7 Rxe7 13. Rxe7 Qxe7 14. Qe1 Qxe1+ 15. Rxe1 {15. Rxe1 - threatening Re8#.} Bb7 {15. ...... Bb7 - Amy stops the mate by developing her bishop and putting pressure on my d5 pawn which is virtually an isolani because I cannot move up my c2 pawn which is blocked by my knight and Fou Leblanc.} 16. h3 {16. h3 - this move creates some air (luft) for my King, Henry and drives back the black knight on g4.} Nf6 17. Kf1 {17. Kf1 - for want of nothing forcing at the moment, Henry decided to move towards the centre.} Nh5 18. Ng5 Nf4 19. g3 Ng6 {19. ..... Ng6 - this move allows me to win another pawn.  You will see how.} 20. d6 cxd6 21. Bxf7+ Kf8 22. Bb3 {22. Bb3 - this move threatens Nxh7#.  It is amazing how, even in the late middlegame, Old Matey can appear out of nowhere and catch you unawares!} Ne5 {22. ...... Ne5? - not the best - this will now drop a piece. 22. ...... d5 would have just lost another pawn.} 23. f4 g6 24. fxe5 dxe5 25. Rxe5 {25. Rxe5 - suddenly I am now 6 points ahead on material.} Ba6+ 26. Ke1 {26. Ke1 - Henry dodges the spite check by moving further towards the centre.} d6 27. Re3 Rc8 {27. ...... Rc8?? - Kg7 would have avoided the carnage to come.} 28. Ne6+ {28. Ne6+ - my rampant steed will collect that black lsb on a6.  Seems incredible does it not?  the knight is a long way from the bishop but the BK must walk into a discovered check wherever he goes, either from my rook on e3 or Fou Leblanc on b3.  Now watch!} Kg8 29. Nc7+ {29. Nc7+ - there it is!  Discovered checks are vicious things.  Even though the square c7 is attacked by the c8 rook the knight cannot be taken as the BK is in check to Fou Leblanc on b3.  So, dearly beloved brethren, that is how the black light squared bishop falls.} Kf8 30. Nxa6 d5 31. Bxd5 h6 32. Nb4 {32. Nb4 - I still cannot get a checkmate, so I concentrate on trying to improve the position of my pieces.} g5 33. Nc6 a6 34. Re7 b5 35. Ne4 {35. Ne4 - Amy told me in the chat that she thought I was threatening Nc5 followed by Nd7# after this move.  I thought that Nf6 looked good.  Well done for spotting that one, Amy!  I then sent her the following analysis:- You must now play 35.  Rd8 to prevent Nd7#.  In response to that she played Ra8.  So I sent her this analysis:- 37. Nxd8 Kxe7 38. Nc6+ Kd6 39. Bg2 Kxc5 - that leaves you two pieces down in the endgame.   } Ra8 36. Nc5 Rc8 {36.  ....... Rc8 - after I sent Amy that analysis she asked me whether she could simply just let me win and left herself on for Nd7#.  Commiserations and better luck next time, Amy.  Also, good luck in your current crop of games.  I hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne} 37. Nd7# {}
