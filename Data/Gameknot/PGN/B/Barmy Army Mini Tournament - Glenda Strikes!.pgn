1. e4 {Hi everyone, I have only just recently got back from my holiday in Devon and have been religiously catching up on my moves - finally I have something to annotate.  In this game I incur a material deficit but, with some imprecise kingside pawn moves, hoping for a kingside pawn storm should I decide to castle short I turned the tables on him.  I double-crossed him by leaving Henry in the centre!  Later on an exchange of bishops brings Glenda to the g file with disastrous consequences for white.  Have a nice read - Joanne!} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nge7 {4. .......Nge7 - this is the Cozio Defence - if white plays BxN then the knight on e2 can go to c3 defending the e pawn.} 5. O-O d6 {5. .......... d6 - opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for Frere Leblanc.} 6. c3 Ng6 {6. .......... Ng6 - frees up d7 for Frere Lenoir.} 7. d4 Be7 {7. ......... Be7?! - this move was recommended in the World Database and in fact two strong experts played this move and won.  It loses a pawn, however.   The excalmation mark part of the move is that at least black will have the bishop pair, but is it enough?  I am now ready to castle, but as you will see, I never got round to it!} 8. d5 b5 9. dxc6 bxa4 10. Qxa4 {10. Qxa4 - sure enough the a pawn drops, worse it brings out the Wicked Witch of the West to a pretty good square - my a pawn is pinned - white has such a clear advantage that it seems inconceivable that he will cop Old Matey just ten moves from this diagram, especially as the mating piece, Glenda is just sitting passively on her home square.} Be6 {10. .......... Be6 - developing a piece and unpinning my a pawn.} 11. h3 {11. h3 - not fatal, but a step in the wrong direction.} Nh4 12. Nxh4 Bxh4 {12. ......... Bxh4 - after this exchange of bishops I really do have the bishop pair and have opened white up a little - I now have a slight lead in development.} 13. g4 {13. g4?! - in a pm to me after the game my buddy dmaestro condemned this move as weakening, and this invites my next move ......... h5 to begin a pawn storm of my own as I have not yet castled and the centre is firmly fixed, Henry is as snug as a bug in the proverbial rug!} h5 14. Qd1 {14. Qd1 - the Wicked Witch retreats to transfer herself over to the kingside but my opponent sends his development into reverse!} hxg4 15. f4 gxh3 {15. .............. gxh3 - what a transformation there has been in the space of just one move - I am now ahead on material and have got a strong passed h pawn, the g file is open and I just need something to break through.} 16. f5 Bc4 17. Rf3 Bg5 {17. ...... Bg5 - unmasks a protective battery on that strong h pawn and threatens to exchange bishops to make way for a landing spot for Glenda on h5.} 18. Bxg5 {18. Bxg5?? - this move loses by force, I think white just had to try Rg3 to take control of that g file.} Qxg5+ {18. ........... and here comes Glenda!  White can avoid instant death by playing Kf2, but then the h pawn crowns.} 19. Kh2 {19. Kh2 - this move does invite instant death and Glenda deals it on g2 leaving me 5 rating points better off.} Qg2# {}
