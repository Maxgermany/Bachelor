1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {Starts out with the French defense I've seen several players lately using this.  It is quite solid and not a bad choice vs a stronger opponent.} 3. Nd2 {I believe this to be the best option as you don't have to deal with the annoying pin with Nc3.  However it is going to delay the c1 bishops development. } Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. Bd3 c5 {Main Closed line.} 6. c3 c4 {Don't see this that often as black usually tries to take advantage of the weak d4 square. } 7. Bc2 b5 8. Ne2 {I played this move to defend c3 and possibly develop the knight there if I happen to exchange of the c pawn.} Nc6 9. a3 {Adding defenses to b4.} Bb7 10. O-O a5 {black is playing to attack the queen side which is pawn structure suggests.} 11. Nf3 h6 12. Bd2 a4 13. Ne1 {First piece back to the home rank I was planing on going for an f5 break so I needed to move this knight. In hind sight I should have probably played 11. f4 instead of Nf3. But in closed games the action is not happening quickly so I have time to make these strange moves. } Na5 14. f4 Nb6 15. Nc1 {Defending b3 and I may want to move my knight to b4 at some point.} Nb3 16. Nxb3 axb3 {Okay here is where things get a bit cramped because I took with the knight I've opened myself up to the following combination which seems to totally lock down my structure.  However I wasn't ready to give up my good bishop for a knight.} 17. Bb1 Na4 18. Bc1 {Notice that now all my pieces have returned to the home rank that are not off the board that is.  The knight on a4 is a great paralyzing piece for black as it inhibited both my c1 bishop and a1 rook from coming into the game.  However black really doesn't have any way to take advantage of this as of current and will most likely need to move the knight in order to make a breakthrough.  My goals are going to be getting my lsb out from its square on b1 since all the pawns are guarding my squares.  A good way to do this would to break open the board with f5.  Really none of my pieces are that bad since the action is going to most likely take place on the king side and all my pieces are slicing though it.} Kd7 {?! was expecting him to play Be7 and I'm not sure this really helps him as when the center breaks up his king will be exposed. } 19. f5 Kc6 20. Qg4 {?! perhaps I should have played fxe6 fxe6 Bg6 but I liked this move because it stalls the bishops development by at least a move or two and he now must react to my threat of fxe6.} Bc8 {Best move in this situation as fxe6 is meet by Bxe6 bring some life into his bishop.} 21. fxe6 Bxe6 22. Qg3 h5 {I believe this was to have the possibility of playing h4 though I don't find this move all that attractive if I where black I'd deal with the problem with my g7 pawn.} 23. Rf2 {Freeing up my c1 bishop.} g6 24. Bg5 {Bring my pieces into action .} Be7 25. Nf3 Bg4 {! now I must trade dsb but this shouldn't be a problem for me in the long run.} 26. Bxe7 Qxe7 27. Qh4 {I offer a queen trade to strengthen my position my knight actually looks better on h4 seeing as any move black makes to break open the king side will be meet by my knight moving into his position.} Qxh4 {He accepts...} 28. Nxh4 Rhf8 29. h3 {pushing back the bishop.} Be6 30. Kh2 Nb6 {Releasing the tension on my pieces ? I was excited to see this move as I was having troubles figuring out how to continue.  Note that Kh2 was sort of a waiting move.} 31. Nf3 {Strange that after I said that my knight was better on h4 I can actually largely benefit with my knight on g5 due to the position of the e6 bishop.  Chess is game of constant motion a push and pull of sorts and my opponent is giving me openings :)} Nd7 32. Ng5 {My threat is simply to win a pawn say Nxe6 fxe6 Rxf8 Bxg7 and that bishop is extremely deadly and much harder to deal with than the d7 knight.} Rae8 {Trying to hold things together. } 33. a4 {! breaking my rook from its prison. } f5 {?! not a good idea I had planned on exchange e for f no matter how this pawn was pushed and I actually will now get the upper hand because of his e8 rook.  Notice how I've been using his moves to prepare my onslaught just waiting to pounce.  } 34. exf6 e.p. Nxf6 {? He'd been better off playing Rxf6 Rxf6 Bxg6.} 35. Bxg6 {! now both e8 and e6 are under attack.  It will be very hard for black to maintain pieces here.  Say Re7 Raf1} Ng4+ {Black decides to play a tactic to win the f2 rook however it doesn't quite work since the e8 rook will be hanging. } 36. hxg4 Rxf2 37. Bxe8+ {Black resigns for after Kd6 Nxe6 is devastating.  For instance the line might follow Kd6 Nxe6 Kxe6 axb5 Rxb2 gxh5 Ra2 Rb1 and black must now deal with two advancing pawns.  Or Kd6 Nxe6 Kxe6 axb5 hxg4 Rb1 and white has the hard to dea with Bc6 pressuring the base of blacks pawn chain and protecting his advanced pawn the game will be slow but should be an easy win for white.}
