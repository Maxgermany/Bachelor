1. e4 {This is a blitz game I played that ended quickly. My opponent starts off with the king pawn.} e5 2. Qh5 {Starts with his queen.} Nf6 {Threatening the queen while developing my pieces.} 3. Qxe5+ {Didn't notice that!} Be7 {I develop further and protect my king.} 4. d3 O-O {I castle for protection and to prepare my rook. I feel like I have more developed pieces than white because he was busy moving his queen.} 5. Qc3 {This is the mistake. If I can safely get my bishop to b4, his queen is gone!} Nc6 6. a3 {He saw that coming!} Re8 {Taking the e file and directing my rook at his king.} 7. Qd2 d5 {Bait} 8. Nc3 {Didn't take it and protected his queen.} Nd4 {Getting my knight in a good position} 9. Nxd5 {Mistake} Nxd5 10. exd5 {Yes!} Bb4+ {My opponent resigned. I concluded that developing your pieces and protecting your king are the most important things. And moving your queen around at the beginning of the game only causes problems}
