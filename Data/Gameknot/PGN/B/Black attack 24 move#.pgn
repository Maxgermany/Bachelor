1. e4 {Nothing out of the ordinary for the first few moves....} c5 {I plump for the Sicilian, i find it pretty flexible and is probably my fav to play as black... } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Standard stuff...} e6 4. c3 {A very popular move among top flight players as well as us lowly folk....} Nf6 {No chance of Bg4 pinning me to my Queen so i go for the old Nf6 shuffle....} 5. d3 {I spoke too soon it seems...} h6 {Remedied...} 6. O-O Be7 7. Bf4 d6 8. Bb5 {Seizing the opportunity to pin me... } Qb6 {I want an instant decision as to the future of that bishop...} 9. Bxc6+ {And that decision is provided, I don't mind this little arrangement. At this point everything is about equal developmentally speaking and positionally. No commitments have been made as yet...} Qxc6 10. b3 {The old pawn advance heading my way, however this move does hinder the white queen a little and if my opponent isn't planning on keeping it there why not move to b4 in 1 foul swoop? } e5 {So i make room for my Qbishop and also attack his. Notice how i still haven't committed to castling yet on either side, hopefully this serves as a source of a little annoyance to my opponent.....} 11. Be3 {Support for the d push maybe...} Bg4 {What the hell, it is annoying...} 12. h3 {fair enough...} Bh5 {I decide to try and keep the pin going for as long as i can....} 13. Nbd2 {And that's the end of that...} b6 {Strengthening my pawn chain a little, whilst i still have the time..} 14. Qc2 O-O {With that last pawn move obviously I had committed to a king-side castle slide....} 15. Rfe1 Bd8 {I wanted to line up this Bishop with h2, it wasn't doing much where it was and i felt when the big pawn exchange happens it will be a dangerous diagonal to own..} 16. Nh2 {Prep for a little Nf1-Ng3 jig....} Bc7 {Mission completed....} 17. Ndf1 {I see...} d5 {Now is as good a time as any to open up the centre, especially with that last knight move...} 18. Ng3 {Carrying on with the original plan, which is what they say you should do, distractions can cost dearly...} Bg6 {Didn't wanna trade just yet....} 19. Nhf1 dxe4 {Clearing the way...} 20. dxe4 {Splendid....} Nxe4 {I figure I may aswel go the whole hog, I should end up with a dangerous position if nothing else....} 21. Nxe4 Bxe4 {This move being the logical ending to that little sequence of play wins me another pawn and opens a direct line to the white king...} 22. Qb2 Bxg2 {Splitting open the kings defence and exposing him to the harsh realities of life....} 23. c4 {Not the move i would have played....} Bxh3 {Now i issue multiple terminal threats.....} 24. Ng3 {I was flabbergasted when i logged on and saw this move, but i see why. My opponent must have anticipated Qg6+ totally missing the real threat.....} Qg2# {And there it is, at the time of playing i was pretty happy with this win, having gone back through it my opponent made some pretty bad choices along the way but unless i hadn't made the right choices then this game wouldn't have been such a easy win...So hey ho, i've annotated it now so it's going out!
