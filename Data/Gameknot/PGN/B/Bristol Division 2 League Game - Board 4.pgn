[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf"]

1. e4 {I won't annotate the first few moves, any good opening book could do a much better job.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf} 6. f3 {A solid move supporting the centre and preparing a kingside pawn storm.} e6 {Black also opts for solidarity. The other main alternative was 6...e5 when black normally obtains good piece play at the cost of structural weakness.} 7. Be3 {Developing the bishop to an active square supporting the d4 knight. } b5 {Removing the c4 square from the light squared bishop and expanding on the queenside} 8. Qd2 {preparing 0-0-0 with pressure along the d file. An immediate g4 is also playable} Be7 {...Bb7 is more consistent but this move is going to be played at some point so why not now?} 9. Be2 {?! why? what does the bishop do on e2 that it wasn't doing on f1? very little. Not worth the tempo, white should continue 0-0-0 with a powerful d file battery.} Bb7 {The best square for the bishop putting pressure on the white centre and so slowing down whites kingside attack} 10. g4 {continuing in thematic fashion although 0-0-0 is good here too.} Nfd7 {opening the lines for the queen and bishop and so slowing the white pawns as well as repositioning the knight to the queenside.} 11. O-O-O {doubling major pieces on the d file against the slightly weak d pawn and removing th king from the centre} Nb6 {Eyeing the c4 square. A black knight landing there will be quite awkward for white.} 12. Rdf1 {?! a strange move here the rook is much better placed on d1. The motivation of this move is clearly whites desire to play f4 however this goes no way toward achieving that goal. a3 is required in order to play f4 so why not play it now?} Nb8d7 {Blacks previously unmoved queens knight starts its march towards c4 via e5} 13. a3 {finally preparing f4 but white's attack is now quite dangerously behind and black now establishes a rather strong knight on the c4 square. a3 also weakens the kings position which a knight on c4 is primed to exploit} Ne5 {Grabbing the c4 square with both hands.} 14. Bf2 {? not a strong move at all. clearly white wants to keep his dark squared bishop but this move allows black a choice between an obviously better position and winning the exchange. } Nbc4 {14...Bg5 15.Be3 Nbc4 16.Bxg5 Nxd2 17.Bxd8 Nxf1 18.Bg5 h6 19.Bxh6 Rxh6 20.Bxf1 is also playable but i'd rather not cash in just yet} 15. Bxc4 {White jumps at the possiblility of exchanging his terrible light square bishop and clears some space in his own camp, which was starting to look rather crowded.} Nxc4 16. Qd3 {White is looking at sacrifices on b5 by the looks of things.} Rc8 {but this rules them out completely as well as bringing another piece into the attack. Black could also have tried 16...Bg5  followed by Nd2  picking up the rook but the bishop then only becomes misplaced on g5 allowing whites kingside pawns to start moving with tempo and in that terrible f rook even worth my beautiful knight?} 17. f4 {After striving to play this for so long white finally gets the chance, it also shuts down blacks option of ...Bg5.} Qc7 {Threating the a3 pawn as the c3 knight is inadequately defended. } 18. Nde2 {defending the knight and so the a3 pawn as well as protecting the f4 pawn} O-O {Simple and effective. Bringing the last piece across to the queenside while removing the king from the centre, whites kingside attack is not coming soon.} 19. h4 {The white pieces are very disorginised, it is probably better to spend this tempo improving the positioning of the white rooks which currently do very little.} Rfd8 {yet another simple move just gradually maneuvering all his pieces into good positions.} 20. Rfd1 {The rook returns from d1 having achieved very little for the 2 tempo.} d5 {! A strong move, opening lines for the black pieces while white is still trying to reorginise.} 21. exd5 {Else the pawn marches on to either e4 or d4} Bxd5 22. Rhg1 {?! white should exchange on d5 immediately.} Qa5 {! forcing the exchange under more favourable circumstances as ...Bxa3 is mating} 23. Nxd5 {Forced. The queen now covers the a3 square} Rxd5 24. Qb3 {White looks to have everything on the queenside defended, but that d2 square now looks a little weak...} Rcd8 {Black is looking very strong now with all his pieces working harmoniously when compared to whites f2 bishop and g1 rook both of which are doing not a lot black looks much better} 25. Nc3 {? Allows the black queen to penetrate the black position with disastrous consequences.} Rd5xd1+ 26. Rxd1 {26.Nxd1 Qd2  27.Kb1 Qxf4 is also bad for white} Rxd1+ 27. Kxd1 Qd8+ 28. Ke1 {The king needs to defend the bishop} Qd2+ 29. Kf1 Qxf4 {and my opponent resigned being down a pawn with a terrible position. throughout the game white was playing moves that didn't achieve very much at all, squandering his precious tempii in a opening where you really shouldn't. That put him on the back foot throughout the entire game and he didn't even get a sniff of an attack going.   As always i encourage you to leave comments and/or send me messages if you so wish. I'm interested to see what others think of this game. Thank you for reading.}
