[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Maroczy variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 {I'm on an Alekhine run at the moment} 2. d3 Nc6 {two knights to defend} 3. Nc3 e5 {this was a quick game so both players just developing} 4. Nf3 d5 {I have got a slight advantage here} 5. exd5 Nxd5 {white exchanges pawn} 6. Bg5 f6 {Black takes tempo} 7. Be3 Bb4 {and uses it to pin the knight.} 8. Qd2 Bg4 {pin is broken with the queen and black brings bishop out to attack other knight.} 9. a3 Bxc3 {after white threatens bishop bxc3} 10. bxc3 {white takes with his pawn. I couldn't see why this was done at all. Queen was blocked in and pawn was doubled up.} Bxf3 11. gxf3 {I just take the chance to double up whites other side, wrecking the pawn structure.} Qd6 12. c4 Nde7 13. Rb1 Rb8 14. Rg1 g6 {White pushes black slightly out of centre and exploits his open files well.} 15. h3 Qxa3 {I take the chance to snap up material} 16. Rd1 Qd6 {then move my queen back.} 17. h4 Nd4 18. h5 {i guess white is trying to get his rook behind my lines and blunders hugely Nxf3} Nxf3+ {i was going to take the queen, but realised now because of the bottled up nature of whites position bought on by the doubled pawns I could freely take the rook as the king was trapped, then take the queen} 19. Ke2 Nxg1+ {white king forced to go back to original place} 20. Ke1 Nf3+ {the game was resigned.}
