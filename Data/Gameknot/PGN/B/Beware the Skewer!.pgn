[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 {Again I played the Sicilian. I still don't care for it much. I should find something new...} 2. b3 Nc6 3. Ba3 d6 {I have no idea what I'm doing (my limited opening repertoire has already been left in the dust), so I'm just going to work off of basic opening principles and see what happens. I guess I could have played 3. ... b6 but I preferred the c8-h3 diagonal for the bishop.} 4. Nc3 g6 5. Bb5 Bg7 {A nice home for the bishop, pinning white's knight for the moment.} 6. Bxc6+ bxc6 7. Qf3 Nf6 8. O-O-O Bg4 {Not a good castle for white. First, black skewer's the white queen and rook with his 8th move, and now white loses the exchange. Second, he put his king into a dangerous spot, with the half-open b-file as an avenue for black's rooks, and black's bishop on the long diagonal from g7 exerting pressure on white's castled position too.} 9. Qe3 Bxd1 10. Nxd1 Qa5 {And now white loses more material. If 11. Bb2 Qxa2. But white has nothing better than that. If 11. Kb2?? to protect the bishop and the pawn, then 11. ... Ng4 ! wins white's queen.} 11. b4 cxb4 {White's dubious pawn move defended the bishop, but at the cost of a pawn, and now the bishop must retreat anyway, at the cost of another pawn.} 12. Bb2 Qxa2 13. Nf3 Ng4 {White was in real trouble here. Already down by the exchange and two pawns, he cannot afford to let black press the attack on his king. 13. c3 or 13. Qb3 might have saved him, for now. Even 13. d3 gives the king an escape route. Now after black's 13th move, white is in hot water. He must save his queen, but the only move that prevents immediate checkmate is 14. Qb3, which allows black to exchange queens and bishops and transition toward an easy endgame.} 14. Qf4 Bxb2+ {White overlooked the danger and launched an attack of his own, intending to follow up with 15. Ng5. But he never gets the chance, as now it's mate in 2 beginning with black's 14th move.} 15. Nxb2 Qa1# {As a side note, in the twelve days it took to play this 15-move game, my rating went up exactly 100 points, so that when I finally won this game, I took a -9 hit to my rating; I suppose it's a good thing I didn't lose...}
