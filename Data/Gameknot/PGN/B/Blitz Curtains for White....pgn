[Opening "Amsterdam attack (A00)"]

1. e3 {I was unaccustomed to this unconventional opening...} e5 2. d3 d5 {Already I am worried about my commitment to a large pawn center...} 3. h3 Nc6 4. g3 {A very defensive setup from white.  I debate whether to proceed with natural development or grab more space...} Nge7 5. Bg2 f6 6. b3 {Perhaps this is some type of "hedgehog" setup...} Bf5 {Perhaps placing the bishop here will prove too committal...} 7. a3 {Yes, I believe this is a hedgehog.} d4 {I decide to try and open some lines.  I am not finished with development, but I am much farther along than white...} 8. Bb2 Nd5 {A bad blunder that sets the stage for the rest of the game.  Falling behind in material means I have to play for his king.} 9. e4 Ne3 {I wanted to damage his kingside pawn structure in order to prevent the king from castling.  His queenside pawns are already a bit loose, and I doubted he wanted to castle there.} 10. fxe3 Be6 11. exd4 Nxd4 {I had exd, which would keep more material on the board, but the idea here was to exchange off his dark-squared bishop, as his light-squared bishop looks like it might be bad...} 12. Nf3 {He wants to hang on to the bishop...} c5 13. Nbd2 Nxb3 {Another move calculated to damage his pawns...After nxb3 I am down 5 points in material, and the game will be a write-off unless I can quickly stir up an attack...} 14. Nxb3 Be7 15. Qd2 c4 {A pawn sac.  I am trying to open lines and make use of the semi-open b-file...} 16. dxc4 Qb6 17. Rd1 {Better would have been rb1...This allows me to gain a tempo on his queen...} Rd8 18. Nfd4 {Offering material back...but after exd and bxd4 he is regaining the initiative...} O-O 19. Qf2 exd4 20. Bxd4 Qa6 {My attack seems to be waning, the queen having been driven to a seemingly weak square...} 21. Nc5 {Threatening nxe6 and then winning the exchange.} Qa5+ 22. c3 Bxc5 {White's knight move has allowed my queen back into the game...} 23. Bxc5 Qxc3+ 24. Rd2 Qc1+ 25. Ke2 {A forced move...White cannot play rd1 because of qxd1#.} Bxc4+ 26. Kf3 Qc3+ 27. Be3 {White appears to have warded off the attack.  Will f5 be to slow?} f5 28. Bf1 {Vacating g2 for the king.  Perhaps white is better with exf...} fxe4+ {Winning the queen, I am now massively up in material...} 29. Kg2 Rxf2+ 30. Rxf2 {His e3 bishop is en pris.  White is now losing this...} Bxf1+ 31. Rhxf1 Qxe3 32. Kg1 Qxg3+ 33. Rg2 Qe3+ 34. Rgf2 {A useful pin that allows me to swing the rook into action without threats of rf8#} Rd6 35. Kg2 Rg6+ {It's going to be curtains for white...} 36. Kh2 Qg3+ 37. Kh1 Qxh3+ 38. Rh2 Qxf1# {This was an exciting game in which I used the initiative to overcome a substantial material deficit.}
