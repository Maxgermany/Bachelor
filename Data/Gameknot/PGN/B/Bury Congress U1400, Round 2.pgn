1. e4 {Hi everyone, after a dinner break it was time for Round 2 in which I had the black pieces.  I decided to play the French Defence, which was quite a usual response to e4 in my tournament games OTB.  I got the Winawer and played a rather unusual line against it.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {3. Nc3 - this is the Winawer, develops a piece and contests e4.} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 {4. ................ Nd7 - prepares Nf6 and allows my pawn to advance to c5 at the right moment.} 5. Be3 Ngf6 6. Nc3 {6. Nc3 - eschews exchange on f6.} Bb4 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 {8. bxc3 - transposes into a more regular Winawer I think.} b6 9. Qf3 Rb8 {9. ................ Rb8 - dodges the Wicked Witch of the West's attack on the long diagonal and prepares Bb7 which I play on my next turn.} 10. Bg5 Bb7 11. Bb5 c6 {11. ............... c6??? - having a bad hair day here, forgot the Wicked Witch is en prise - still, I hope you understand, this is the Beginner Section!!} 12. Bd3 O-O 13. Qg3 Nh5 14. Qg4 {14. Qg4 - that Wicked Witch ain't gonna give me a second chance!  However, Glenda is also en prise so it would have been a mere queen trade - anyhow, white chooses to keep the queens on.} Ndf6 15. Qh4 c5 16. Nf3 Bxf3 17. gxf3 Re8 18. Rg1 Kf8 19. Bxh7 cxd4 20. Bd2 e5 21. Rb1 dxc3 22. Bg5 Qd7 {22. ................ Qd7 - after an exchange of pieces on f3 and one pair of pawns white has isolanis all over the place and the position is favourable.  But I could have wrapped it all up on move 11!} 23. Rb3 g6 {23. ............. g6 - I now trap his lsb but white has an awkward check on h6 for me to contend with - luckily Henry has a flight square on e7.} 24. Bh6+ Ke7 25. Bxg6 fxg6 26. Rxg6 {26. Rxg6 - at last I have a material advantage, but I should have been reading a book by now- also, black's position looks rather precarious.} Reg8 {26. ................... Rg8 - to contest the g file and to try and relieve some kingside pressure.} 27. Qb4+ Qd6 28. Rxg8 Rxg8 29. Qxc3 {29. Qxc3?? - this allows a combo that drops the white queen, wait for it ............} Rg1+ 30. Ke2 Qd1+ {30 ..................... Qd1 , wait for it ............} 31. Ke3 Nd5+ {31. .................... Nd5  - NOW! - At the end of this rudimentary king hunt there is a vicious knight fork which will win white's queen.  Ding dong, at last the Wicked Witch is dead! White throws in the sponge.  Time for tea and then Round 3.}
