[Opening "Philidor (C41), Hanham, Krause variation"]

1. e4 {This was a 5-minute blitz game, played offline at my home. I can play so badly sometimes--yes, I am Black in this one.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor Defense. It's solid but passive and rarely played at the highest levels. I would never play this on GameKnot.} 3. d4 {The most common move, and probably best move.} Nd7 {I considered channeling the Allies who lost to Morphy at the Opera House (3...Bg4) but thought better of it. If only I thought better later. This move is called the Hanham variation.} 4. Bc4 g6 {I know there's some Philidor system with this move, but I sure didn't do it right!} 5. dxe5 Nxe5 {I think this is the losing move, although I don't think Black's position is any good after 5...dxe5 either. It's just not salvageable now.} 6. Nxe5 dxe5 7. Bxf7+ Ke7 {Obviously, if 7...Kxf7 then 8. Qxd8} 8. Bg5+ {White keeps at it, trying to win that queen.} Nf6 {Interposing! That will work. Right? RIGHT?} 9. Bxf6+ {No. No it will not. Black loses the queen. I resigned.}
