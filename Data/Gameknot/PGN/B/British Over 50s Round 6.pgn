[Opening "Benko gambit (A57)"]

1. d4 {Reminder of the time limit - 40 moves in 90 minutes, plus 30 minutes if your time runs out before then, plus 30 second increment.} Nf6 {Again I was late for the start - 18 minutes this time - because of road works on the A41 near Chester.} 2. c4 {So it starts conventionally enough.} c5 {I was expecting this.} 3. d5 {I reply with the main line, heading for the Benoni group of openings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoni_Defense} b5 {A slight surprise, as he had played e7-e5 earlier in the tournament. I did see he had played this, the Benko Gambit, before. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benko_Gambit} 4. f3 {Modern practice is to decline the gambit although this may not be the best way of declining it.} e6 {He develops.} 5. e4 {This is the natural move.} bxc4 {He takes.} 6. Bxc4 {Having lost time in arriving late, I played this quickly. My opponent pointed out afterwards that 6. Nc3 is more common.} exd5 {He takes.} 7. exd5 {I recapture.} d6 {He blocks the pawn.} 8. Nc3 {Normal development.} Be7 {In many lines of the Benko the Bf8 goes to g7, but in this position I can throw in a queen check on e2 if he tries that.} 9. Nge2 {Normal development.} O-O {He castles.} 10. O-O {I castle. Gouret, Thierry (2300) vs. Le Bourhis, Dominique (2050)  continued with O-O 10.	Ng3	Re8 11.	O-O	a6 12.	a4	Nbd7 13.	Re1	Ne5 which I think is better than what he played. The Gameknot game wwgia (1745) vs. hbking (2023) continued with Nbd7 11.	Ng3	Ne5 12.	b3	Qa5 13.	Bb2	Nxc4 14.	bxc4	Ba6 which I think is also better.} Na6 {Ganging up on the d pawn.} 11. Ng3 {The natural square for the knight. I can also gang up on his d pawn with a knight to e4 and bishop to f4. On this square I am also restricting the development of his Bc8. I think white is doing OK here.} Nc7 {Continuing with his plan.} 12. Re1 {Again, the natural place to put the rook.} a6 {Presumably to prevent my knight from going to b5 and maybe preparing to put his knight on b5 in some variations.} 13. Qd3 {Threat - Nf5.} g6 {A somewhat drastic way of preventing Nf5. Black weakens his dark squares significantly. I should just play Bh6 here and double rooks on the e file and white is doing fine, or maybe Bg5, but....} 14. Rxe7 {I thought I was winning back enough material.} Qxe7 {He takes back.} 15. Bg5 {With a horrible threat of Ne4.} Qe5 {The only move.} 16. f4 {I protect my bishop and attack his queen.} Qd4+ {When I sacrificed on e7 I considered 15...Qe5 and thought that 16. f4 won. I hadn't seen this queen check.} 17. Qxd4 {So I take.} cxd4 {He takes back.} 18. Bxf6 {I take his knight.} dxc3 {He takes my knight.} 19. Bxc3 {I take back. A pawn for the exchange is not really enough, although converting it can be a problem.} Bb7 {This is a mistake. He should have played f5, keeping my knight out of his position.} 20. Ne4 {Now if he takes on d4 I have a fork on f6 winning a piece. Plus 21. Nf6+ is a nasty threat.} Ne8 {He protects d6 and f6.} 21. Bb3 {With the idea of Rd1 and Bh4 attacking his knight with is protecting d6.} f5 {Hitting my knight.} 22. Ng5 {Knight advances.} h6 {hits the knight again.} 23. Ne6 {Knight jumps in again.} Rf7 {And his rook is sort of developed along the rank.} 24. Bb4 {Attacking d6, again with the plan of Ba4 and Rd1, but it is too slow.} a5 {I hadn't expected this, but it looks good.} 25. Ba3 {Bishop retreats.} a4 {He advances again.} 26. Bc4 {I have to keep on the d pawn.} Ba6 {being material up, he wants to exchange pieces.} 27. Bxa6 {I take.} Rxa6 {He recaptures.} 28. Rc1 {I seize the c file, threatening Rc8} Ra8 {So he stops this.} 29. Rc6 {I offered a draw here, he declined.} Rd7 {He protects d6.} 30. Kf2 {I start to develop my king.} Ra5 {He attacks d5.} 31. Rc8 {Attacking the knight.} Kf7 {He protects.} 32. Nd8+ {I check.} Kf8 {Not 32..... Ke7?? 33. Nc6+ winning! Now if I check again on e6 he just moves his king to e7 and I have run out of checks.} 33. Nc6 {So I played this.} Rxd5 {He takes.} 34. Ra8 {I attack the a pawn.} Rc7 {He hits my knight.} 35. Nb4 {I hit his rook.} Rd2+ {He checks.} 36. Ke3 {Another mistake by me. Simply Kf3, I am picking up his a pawn, and I am still in the game. This is the losing mistake.} Rxg2 {He takes.} 37. Nd5 {I hit his rook.} Rd7 {He defends d6. Now when I played Ke3 I though that 38. Nf6 won. 38....Re7 is forced. I thought that after 39. Kf3 I was threatening both the rook on g2 and the pawn on d6, but he has Rd2 saving the rook and protecting d6.} 38. Nc7 {So I tried this, with a similar threat. If 38....Rxc7 39. Bxd6+ although even there he has Rd7 winning.} Re7+ {But he chose this way to win.} 39. Kd3 {I stop his Rg2 from protecting the d pawn.} Kf7 {But this simple move wins easily.} 40. Nd5 {I hit his rook.} Re4 {I am just the exchange and a pawn down. I played it out, but really it is hopeless now. Further comment is unnecessary.} 41. Ra7+ Ke6 42. Nc3 Rxf4 43. Nxa4 Rxh2 44. Nc3 Rh3+ 45. Kc2 Rc4 46. Kb3 Rc6 47. Bb4 f4 48. Ka4 Nc7 49. Ne2 Ke5 50. Ra5+ Ke4 51. Bd2 Rc4+ 52. b4 Rc2 {He threatens mate on a2 and my bishop, so I resigned.
