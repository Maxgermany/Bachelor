1. Nf3 b6 {I have rarely played against this response. I was interested to see what kind of opening would follow. } 2. Nc3 {White Knight Tango. Rare but practical.} Bb7 3. e4 d6 4. d4 g6 5. Bd3 {Bc4 might have been better, but I wanted my knight on c3 to be free of guarding the pawn on e4.} Bg7 6. Be3 {A classical and basic formation that has issues. But in the case of black's set up, it is not bad.} Nh6 {I guess black was scared of e5. Maybe e6 then Ne7 was better.} 7. Qd2 {Immediately attacking and freeing my rook on a1.} O-O {Absolute blunder.} 8. Bxh6 Bxh6 9. Qxh6 Na6 {This is getting sad.} 10. Ng5 {Mate in one threat.} f6 {Nevermind.} 11. Qxh7# {}
