1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nd4 {3..Nd4!?. The start of Blackburne's Schilling Gambit. Apparently so called as the 19th Centuy English master Blackburn used it to win shilling bets against amateur players. Wikipedia states he drank whisky during exhibition games and frequently became drunk and even violent during games! } 4. Nxe5 {4.Nxd4 is a sure thing for White but we all need a little spice in our life. Thses type of games are usually so much more romantic than closed positions} Qg5 {So the giving up of the e pawn was not really a true gambit as white will now be material down} 5. Bxf7+ {The only way to avoid disatser. 5.Nxf7?? leads to 5...Qxg2 6.Rf1 Qxe4 7.Be2 Nf3# -a pretty mate and embarrassing for white.} Ke7 6. O-O {Offering the knight as a sort of counter gambit. White will have excellent central control and room for his pieces to attack Black's exposed king} Qxe5 7. Bxg8 Rxg8 8. c3 {Chasing the Knight away and avoiding losing the rook} Nc6 {8...Ne6 was playable too.} 9. d4 {Advancing the supported central pawns.} Qf6 10. e5 {10. d5 allows to play 10...Ne5.11.f4 Qb6+ 12. Kh1 Nf7 and Black has a reasonable position with 2 bishops. Perhaps Be3 would have allowed d5 at a later point and guard against the check} Qg6 11. f4 b6 {Hoping to bring the bishop to b7 and make use of the dangerous diagonal.} 12. f5 {The pawns march on! Black has made 5 moves with the Queen after 12 moves} Qf7 13. Bg5+ {I'm unsure if this was a good move,it allows Black to exchange bishops and perhaps reach an endgame with an extra piece. White's pawns still look good compensation though.} Ke8 14. Qe2 {Looking at the b5 square and protecting the g2 pawn which may be threatened on the long diagonal} Be7 15. Bxe7 Nxe7 16. Nd2 {I thought about 16.Na3 for a while,aiming at g5 and c7 but opted for the d2 so as to reach c4 and potect the central pawns} Kd8 {Trying to relieve the Knight after f6} 17. Rae1 Qd5 18. Nb3 {Stopping counter play on the a2 square} Bb7 19. c4 Qc6 20. d5 {Again the Black Queen is being harassed by supported pawns} Qh6 21. f6 {Black has problems now.} gxf6 {Is 21...Ng6 any better? It would be met by f7 and the Black queen is locked out and can't bring defensive aid} 22. exf6 Ng6 23. f7 Qf8 24. fxg8=Q Qxg8 {I was rather disappointed with this sequence as White "only " emerges with a rook and a pawn for a bishop advantage.} 25. Rf6 d6 26. Qg4 {Trying to remove the Knight} Bc8 27. Qg5 Ne7 28. Rxd6+ {The final blow} Bd7 29. Qxe7+ Kc8 30. Qxd7+ Kb7 31. Qc6+ {An interesting match I feel, with probably loads of lines available around moves 8,9,10. Please excuse the rather brief analysis. 3..Nd4 looks an cool move for blitz games,I may try it. }
