[White "Lippens "]
[Black "Smit "]
[Opening "Grob (A00), Fritz gambit"]

1. g4 {One of my favorite "oddball" openings, the Grob. White must be careful when using it, as it does expose the K-side somewhat.} d5 {The Classical response to the Grob.} 2. Bg2 {A playable line for White, but as this game shows, dangerous if mishandled.} Bxg4 {Accepting the Pawn.} 3. c4 {Pressuring the Black QP.} c6 {Guarding, and preventing a potential BxNP trapping the R... which can easily be overlooked.} 4. Qb3 {Threatening to win back the Pawn and exchange Queens, neutralizing the potential for a quick Black strike at the White K-side.} Qc7 {Preventing the potential Q exchange and targeting the K-side.} 5. cxd5 {Initiating the exchange...} cxd5 {...and completing it. This move contains a hidden threat...} 6. Bxd5 {...which White, in his eagerness to snatch back the Pawn, completely overlooks.} Qxc1+ {The move Lippens missed in his haste. After 7 Q-Q1 QxQ ch 8 KxQ, Smit would be a clear piece up. Lippens resigns.}
