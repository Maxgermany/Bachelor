[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C63), Schliemann defence"]

1. e4 {As usual.} e5 {He likes to respond with the King's pawn Game.  But, this will continue a little different then usual, even though it does become a Ruy Lopez since I like that variation as that's what I'm most used to.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5 {I forget what it's called as it's not KG, but similar.  However, it is a gambit that ION tries.} 4. d3 {Of course, I decline, knowing that I won't be able to win that pawn, for after 4.exf5, once he plays 4...d7, black immediately compensates.} d6 5. Bxc6+ {However, afterwards, I decide to exchange.  Although, it was a day or so before that lesson in KOH club, I still thought that a N was worth more then a B.  But, that was not the reason behind this move, however.  If I wanted, I didn't have to take.  However, there are two reasons I played this.  First, as Jack told me in my game against Tom since that opponent doesn't like to exchange, when you're up against a much stronger opponent, it's better to exchange early and often, if things are even.  Second, the idea was to double up his pawns because later on, it is known that doubling your pawns will, more often then not, allow your opponent to get a passed pawn because two pawns are one file.  Therefore, the opponent can get a pawn on a file without any pawns in front or to the side of it.  } bxc6 6. Bg5 {Trying to take advantage of that potential weakness.  The idea being also that he cannot take because of my N.  So, I thought that I gained tempo because the idea was to hinder his development.  But, ION, as I thought has ways out of it.  But, one way or another, I am still going to castle on my next move, which I had planned during this move.} Nf6 7. O-O h6 {Wants to exchange, but I kept in mind that if I took, he could strengthen his Q structure.} 8. Bh4 {?? Blunder.  As much as I didn't want to, and have been told that it's generally not a good idea to do this, if your opponent could take back with the Q, 8.Bxf6 was essential, one way or another.  They say that in general, the most common response would've been this move played and then, after 8...g5 9.Bg4 is played.  However, what I said in superandy's annotation was a mistake which was similar as that would've lost a piece due to the B being locked.  Well, I just made the same error.  At best, white winds up the equivalent to a pawn down.} g5 9. Bxg5 {?! This is how I take.  Worth noting that this was only about an hour prior to the link that cplusplus11 showed in KOH club of which is worth more, as I wrongly thought that a N was worth more then a B.  I knew that he'd take my B, and afterwards, I'd take with the N, leaving that piece standing.  However, a B is worth more, in this particular position.  The idea being that after 9.Nxg5, hxg5 10.Bxg5 pins the N.  And, it happens to be a nasty pin.  } hxg5 10. Nxg5 Ng4 {At first, I didn't know why black played this.  But, after what I'm about to do next, the blunder that's made, I figured out that this is a nasty discover attack, in itself.} 11. exf5 {?? With this move, although not underestimating him, I got overly confident that I completely compensated for lost material.  Or as Jack once put it, that I got, "too greedy."  Afterall, as in a lot of cases, "To take is a mistake."  Having said that, this move loses a piece, without compensation.  Instead, I had to get my g N, out of harm's way.} Qxg5 12. h3 {? Trying to get something back, though.  But, while it might not look like one, this is definitely a mistake because it loses another pawn, and with his next move, not sure, but I think my K is exposed as I do see, what I believe to be a weakness.} Rxh3 13. g3 {In this position, as I thought about, I nearly made a blunder as I thought about taking with 13.gxh3, but as we know when a strong player gives something like a R, one must ask why.  And, in this position, with the double check, had I taken, he would've mated with 13...Ne3#  And, the threat is around, so although I don't like it as the K is, now exposed, even if it was, much worse, there's no choice.  At this point, there is only one choice left, and it is this move.} Ne3 {Still going for a, "Quick Kill."  I was worried about my R and Q, which is why I almost took the N, but if I took, he would've immediately mated me with 14...Qxg3#  Therefore, I have no choice but to give up my R.  And, I can't take back as otherwise, he would play ...Qh6, after which ION, would again have a mating sequence.  So, this is, overall, a free R.} 14. Qe2 Nxf1 15. Kg2 {The only way to prevent an immediate mating sequence because of his plan to play ...Qh6  But, now, if he does, I can escape, for now.  And, of course, he checks.} Rh2+ {I analyzed the board carefully, and now, I must take.  For, the only other option is 16.Kf3, which would, immediately, lose my Q.  And, shortly after, he would mate.} 16. Kxf1 Qc1+ {As anticipated.} 17. Qe1 {Forced.} Rh1+ {In this position, I have two options.  But, if I play 18.Ke1, he will still win my Q, and it's mate shortly after 18.Qxe1+  So, I am a little safer with my next move, but not much, as the game is definitely lost for white, regardless.} 18. Kg2 Qxe1 {If I'm not careful, he has 19...Qg1+, 20.Kf3 (forced), and soon after 20...Bh5+ it's mate.  So, there is only one option, but no matter what, as I find out later on, black still has a mating sequence against white.} 19. Kf3 Rh2 {I thought that he would 19...e4+ or 19...Bh5+ but this is much.  } 20. Kg4 {?? I was worried about 20...Qxf2+ 21.Kg4 (forced), Qe2+ 22.Kg5 (forced), Be7#  So, I thought that I had no choice but to play this.  What I didn't know, however, would be the result of his next move.  So, this was a blunder.} Qxf2 {At this point, I resigned because, no matter how you slice the dice, black will mate 21...Qf5#  }
