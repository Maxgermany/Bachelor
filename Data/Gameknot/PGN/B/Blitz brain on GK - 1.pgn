1. e4 {I saved this game because it was an experimental game that worked, 5.b4 was the first time I ever implemented a successful gambit on the spur of the moment and linked it together to win this blitz game in under 60 seconds.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 {this move seemed a bit peculiar to me as it was preempting my dark-squared bishop from sitting at g5 w/o even knowing if I had planned to fianchetto it to b2. Plus it neglected development of the pieces.} 4. Nc3 Nge7 {Poor move, IMO, as it blocks in the bishop & queen prolonging development & castling.  [editor's note: Black's 3rd & 4th move order may have been switched, but I'm certain the rest is accurate as it's pretty much forced.]} 5. b4 {Noticing a familiar setup and lack of developed pieces, I offer the pawn to draw the knight away from protecting e5, with a certain surprise awaiting.} Nxb4 {He takes!} 6. Bxf7+ {Combined with a sacrafice I learned from the Jerome Gambit,(1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Bxf7  Kxf7 5.Nxe5 ), except now there's no pesky knight covering the e5 pawn!} Kxf7 7. Nxe5+ Ke8 {7...Ke8?  7...kg8 would have held out longer} 8. Qh5+ g6 9. Nxg6 Nxc2+ 10. Kf1 {I moved away from the knight in hopes of sacraficing the inactive rook for another critical tempo.} Nxg6 {mate in 2...} 11. Qxg6+ Ke7 {stalemated king} 12. Nd5# {##Mate}
