1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This defeat took me from 1800 back into the high 1700s with a bump, still I hope it will be merely part of the learning curve.  This game was played in the King Pawn Opening Mini-Tournament.  After the double king pawn moves my opponent gives me the Vienna with 2. Nc3.} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 {3. f4 - the Vienna Gambit, after my defeat against Lightottheright when accepting the gambit I decided to decline it with d5 which is very like a Falkbeer Counter Gambit.} d5 4. fxe5 Nxe4 {4. ...... Nxe4 - pawn trade.} 5. d3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 {6. bxc3 - piece trade.} d4 7. Nf3 Nc6 {7. ...... Nc6 - development.} 8. cxd4 Bb4+ 9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Qxd2 {10. Qxd2 - bishop trade.} Nxd4 11. c3 Nxf3+ 12. gxf3 {12. gxf3 - knight trade.} Qh4+ 13. Qf2 Qxf2+ {13. ...... Qxf2+ - queen trade.} 14. Kxf2 Be6 15. d4 O-O-O {15. .......... 0-0-0? I decided to leave the db at that point.  Maybe I should have sent Henry the other way but I thought that this way would keep Henry close to the centre.  A few rook moves from white and I found myself having to put Henry in the corner.  Really bad especially when the enemy king is on the other side of the board and more active.} 16. Ke3 Rhf8 17. Bd3 g6 18. c4 c6 {18. ....... c6 - I try to hold up the advance of John's centre pawns.} 19. Rhc1 Kb8 20. Rab1 Ka8 21. Rb2 {21.  Rb2 - is he gonna double rooks?} f6 22. f4 fxe5 23. fxe5 {23. fxe5 - pawn trade.} Rf7 24. Rf1 Rdf8 {24 .......... Rdf8 - illusory control of the f column on my part!} 25. Rbf2 a6 {25. ..... a6 - to prepare b5.} 26. Rf2xf7 Rxf7 27. Rxf7 Bxf7 {27. ....... Bxf7 - a double rook trade going into a bishop ending.  Now the WK's centralised position and the central pawn majority is gonna be decisive in John's favour.} 28. Ke4 b5 29. d5 {29. d5!! - a match-winning advance.} bxc4 30. Bxc4 {30. Bxc4 - pawn trade.} Kb8 31. e6 cxd5+ 32. Kxd5 {32. Kxd5 - another pawn trade.  Fou Leblanc now moves to e8 to blockade.} Be8 33. Bxa6 {33. Bxa6 - not only am I now a pawn minus I have a remote a passer to contend with.  Not to mention the e6 passer.} Kc7 34. Ke5 g5 {34. ....... g5 - a desperate try to make the most of my kingside pawn majority.  The plan I had was to advance the kingside pawns to divert the WK away from the e6 pawn.  Note that without the a passer then provided I could get Henry safely to h8 then I could sac Fou Leblanc for the e6 pawn and then the game would have been drawn because white has a lsb and does not command the h8 square.  White would have had nothing better than to give me the wrong kind of mate.  However the a pawn is there and that makes all the difference.} 35. Bd3 h6 36. Kf6 Kd6 37. Bg6 {37. Bg6 - here I wave the white flag because I will lose my kingside pawns and although I can give up Fou Leblanc for the e pawn that still leaves the two remote pawns on both sides of the board.  Henry will not have a hope in hell of catching both of them and preventing the appearance of the Wicked Witch of the West and I will eventually cop Old Matey.  So let's get it over with, resign and move on and hope for better things later.}
