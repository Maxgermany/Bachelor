1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. d4 Bd7 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bxc6 {Offers the bishop pair} bxc6 {That costs a pawn. Black had to play Bxc6} 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Nxe5 Nf6 {Gives his bishop pair} 9. O-O {The bishop can be taken always, because after a move like Be6 falls pawn c6} Bd6 10. Nxd7 Qxd7 11. f4 {Goes for attack. Be3 was an alternative} Bc5+ 12. Kh1 Qxd1 13. Rxd1 O-O {Better was the very strong Ng4!} 14. h3 {Now that won't follow anymore} Bb4 15. e5 Bxc3 16. bxc3 Nd5 {Black's pawn structure isn't better, but white has a bishop and black a knight.} 17. c4 Nc3 {now the knight goes to the side. Better was calmly Nb6} 18. Rd3 Na4 19. Ba3 {Strong move to bring rook a1 to d1} Rfd8 20. Rad1 {And now black must exchange} Rxd3 21. Rxd3 {cxd3 is too passive and causes a few holes. A good side is that it heals the pawn structure.} Nb6 22. Bc1 {Reactivating the bishop. On Nxc4 follows Rc3 Na5 Bd2} h6 23. Kg1 {Still c4 can't be taken} Rb8 24. Kf2 {Let black think c4 can be taken} Nxc4 25. Rc3 Rb4 26. a3 Ra4 27. Ke2 {Brings the king and then the pawn will fall} Nb6 {black goes already back, to prevent worse} 28. Rxc6 Rxf4 {big blunder} 29. Bxf4 {And now of course resigned}
