1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 e6 3. e3 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nd2 a6 {I know d5 is good here, but I just want to see what happens if I don't. This op won't show me moves like e4.} 6. Ngf3 b5 {My idea is to leave his strong dsb threatening the vacuum squares while I build a battery on g2 on the light squares. } 7. Bd3 {I have to be sure he won't place the B on e4 unless I can exchange or kick it from the white diagonal. } Bb7 8. O-O Qb6 {Heading for c6 at the right moment. } 9. Ne4 Nxe4 10. Bxe4 f5 {The lsb is kicked back. I'm ready to castle Qside (even with his B looming).} 11. Bc2 h6 {...while I can. Too much of an expansion, but o-o-o was just helping him. } 12. e4 {Well played!} g5 {Will he dare to sac the B?} 13. Bd2 {The B sac was promising, but it opened my own chances trough the g column. } O-O-O {I won't lie: I overlooked f5's weakness...} 14. exf5 {To retake is just ugly! I tried a desperado bad move... that became a good one.} g4 {I didn't want to play this before Be7. Now the N can go to h4, and to g6. True is that I already understood that my opponent wasn't for risk or attack.} 15. Ne5 {The chance I was waiting for to activate my lsb. At the cost of letting his pawn's in.} Nxe5 16. dxe5 Qc6 {He can't block with the B, and I'll welcome f3.} 17. f3 {...but if now gxf3, Qxf3, and after, say, Qb6, Be4... without time, I wasn't completely sure about it. Here I blundered.} d5 {Not being sure about gxf3 (the obvious move is not always the best), I couldn't allow Be4 either. When I realized that he won't take en passant, it was too late. } 18. fxe6 {Now I have to be careful with his Bf5...} Qxe6 {I sense I'm throwing away the game. gxf3 had to be played.} 19. fxg4 {I realized that taking the pawn was too risky, just opened lined for his B.} Qb6 {If Be3, d4.} 20. Bf5+ Kb8 21. a4 {A good attack, I have to be careful about. } c4+ 22. Kh1 d4 23. cxd4 {I realize now I could have taken with the R, but...} Qxd4 {Can I take (if white makes a random move) Qxe5? If Bf5, Qb6, e6+. Ka8...} 24. Bc3 Qb6 {His Q must answer} 25. Qc2 b4 {...and this makes almost useless his attack on b5/a5} 26. Be1 {...planning Bf3.} Bg7 {A very bad move: better was Be7, looking at g5, supporting Rd2.} 27. Bf2 {Another mistake. It allows me to press on g2 again.} Qc6 28. Rfg1 {The "natural" move, but it has a downside:} Bxe5 29. Rac1 {c3 was enough, but I "saw" something very nice. Can you?} h5 30. Qxc4 Qxc4 31. Rxc4 hxg4 {...and white can't stop the mate: h3, gxh3, Rh5! RxR, BxR, Rh8... or, if Re1, Rxh2+, Kg1, Rxg2+, Kf1, g3, RxBe5, gxBf2, and white survives... let's see.} 32. Re1 Rxh2+ 33. Kg1 Rxg2+ 34. Kf1 Rxf2+ 35. Kxf2 g3+ 36. Kg1 Bd4+ 37. Kf1 g2+ 38. Ke2 Re8+ 39. Kd2 Rxe1 {...and we can stop here, as they say... :-)}
