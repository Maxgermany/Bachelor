1. d4 d5 {QPG} 2. c4 {Queen's gambit} c6 {Slav defence} 3. Nc3 {Alekhine variation} Nf6 4. Bg5 g6 {In this position I prefer the fianchetto bishop and a strong castle. I wasn't attracted by e6 blocking my light square bishop completely and pinning my f6 knight} 5. e3 Bg7 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. Be2 dxc4 8. Bxf6 {Exchanging too early?} Bxf6 9. Ne5 Bxe2 10. Nxe2 Qa5+ 11. Nc3 Na6 12. Qg4 Qb6 13. Nd7 {Nxc4 was largely better, killing the passed pawn and protecting from the following move} Qxb2 14. Nxf6+ exf6 15. O-O f5 16. Qf4 Qxc3 17. Qe5+ Kd7 {Obviously protecting my rook} 18. Rac1 Qb2 {Bad move if next white plays Rb1 he threatens mate by Rxb7+} 19. Rxc4 Qxa2 {Black gets the initiative back} 20. Rcc1 Rae8 21. Qf4 b5 {Crafty (I can only afford free stuff) thinks this is a blunder and proposes Qd5 instead. In the heat of the game I felt this move would put some pressure on white while giving me some space but I didn't anticipate white's d5 move} 22. d5 Re4 23. dxc6+ Kc8 24. Qd6 Rd8 25. Qf6 Re6 26. Qa1 {Blunder. With the material advantage black doesn't hesitate and exchanges. Qxf7 is best and dangerous for black} Qxa1 27. Rcxa1 Rxc6 28. h3 b4 29. Rfb1 Rb6 30. Rbc1+ Kb8 31. f4 b3 32. Rcb1 b2 33. Ra2 Rd2 {I needed some more time to finish calculating the implications after Rd1+} 34. Kf1 {Wants to play Ke1 to prevent my rook sacrifice, but he is 1 move short and puts his king in the open.} Rd1+ {Decision taken, the a-pawn is going to do the job. On a second thought Rc2 was a lot faster, preparing for Rc1+} 35. Rxd1 b1=Q 36. Rxb1 Rxb1+ 37. Kf2 Nc5 38. Ra4 {I missed that rook...} Rb2+ 39. Kf3 Kb7 {I missed the rook again...} 40. Ra5 {Rd4 was best} Kb6 {I missed a mate with Ne4! and Rf2#} 41. Ra3 a5 42. g4 Kb5 43. gxf5 gxf5 44. Ra1 a4 45. Rd1 a3 46. Ra1 a2 47. h4 Nb3 {Mate in 4 missed with Ne4} 48. Rd1 Rb1 49. Rd5+ Kb4 50. Rd7 a1=Q 51. Rb7+ {looking for a draw} Kc3 52. Rc7+ Kb2 53. Rxf7 Rf1+ 54. Ke2 Qe1+ {with only a couple minutes left I couldn't the obvious mate Qd1#} 55. Kd3 Qd2+ {Mate in 3 missed: 55. ... Qc3+ 56. Ke2 Qc4#} 56. Kc4 Rc1+ 57. Kb5 Qd5+ {Mate in 1 missed and I went for the material (Qa5)} 58. Kb6 Qxf7 {White resigned}
