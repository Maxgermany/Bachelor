1. d4 {To kick off, I played d4, which is a very common first move (at least by me :D)} e6 {And I got a response, I think it's not very common after 1. d4} 2. c4 {Hmhmmmm! :D I like this combination :)} Nf6 {The opponent develops a knight! ...But... What's this? ...} 3. Bg5 {... A sudden attack and pin!} h6 {What do you think my next move is? Oh, yes, of course.} 4. Bxf6 {Hahaaa :D You believed it! :D:D:D} Qxf6 {And here comes the first member of the Royal Family!} 5. Nc3 {In response, I bring my knight.} Bb4 {And he brings his bishop...} 6. Qc2 {And I offer up a free meat! It's because of cheese, believe me!} Qxd4 {Whoah! Who would thought?!} 7. Nf3 {It's my other knight! Look the Queen, she always moves! :D} Qxc4 8. e3 {And another attack! ...} Bxc3+ {... But she is having a rest now :D} 9. bxc3 {Well... I think this is better than Qxc3 because there would come another exchange, while I was 2 points down in material.} Qg4 {Escaping again...} 10. h3 {... Why not? :D} Qh5 {The same... :D The Queen moves, for sure! :D} 11. Bd3 {Bringing out the bishop to d3, I prepared an attack in the direction of my opponent's kingside.} O-O {But he doesn't feel unconfortable, and castles calmly and cheerfully.} 12. g4 {And the Queen has to move far from the kingside. It's worth have a look at the minor pieces.} Qa5 {The Queen goes very far, and so I can bring an attacker closer to the opponent's kingside by... } 13. Nh4 {... Nh4. And, as if he wants to develop some pieces into the middle of the board, he plays:} d5 {d5... I don't think this move is very promising for Black...} 14. Bh7+ {...So I attack!} Kh8 {The only option is Kh8. And after a bit of planning, I noticed that my bishop is not in a big danger, not only if Black can play g6, so I ...} 15. O-O {... castle, and also connect my rooks.} g6 {And g6 comes. Decide whether it's a good move or a bad one, but I think I have great advantages as I have many attacking pieces around the black king.} 16. Bxg6 {Looks like I gave up my other bishop, too.} fxg6 {Looks like he takes it. Yes, now i can fork his king and his rook, but after, he can take my knight...} 17. Nxg6+ {NEVER MIND :D} Kg7 {I have no chances to give check, so... } 18. Nxf8 {I get some material back.} Kxf8 {I'm 1 point down now, but the black king has no defender!} 19. Qg6 {So, I put my Queen on g6, maybe Qh7 would be better, also can take tha h6 pawn, but a chance to go to h8 and give a check, afterwards take the c8 bishop.} Nc6 {Ehhh... He has a knight in the game! What an advance! Oh! And he also protects his bishop!} 20. Qxh6+ {I manage to equalize, and give a check at the same time.} Ke7 {With Ke7 I think he wanted to get closer to his army. Correct me, if not.} 21. Qg7+ {Then get more closer!} Kd6 {Uhh... In my opinion it's not the best move...} 22. Qf8+ {Although it seems he has 3 options to move his king to, there are only two, because if 22... Ke5, 23.Qf4# follows...} Ne7 {Hmm... I pinned his knight :D} 23. e4 {As his king seems to be more and more exposed and gets in bigger and bigger danger, I moved this. If dxe4, there is an open file and a chance for my rook te develop and give a check. If d4, I can form a pin with any of my rooks or either take it with my c3 pawn. Other options:  -if 24... e5 25.exd5 ->Qxd5?: Any rook to d1 ->Kxd5?: the same, and also I give a check. -if something other (for me, convenient): 24. e5+ attacking his king, and bring the rooks, or first Re1 and after e5+, or after Re1 dxe5 comes, then Rd1+ also attacks Black's king.} Qxc3 {It's one of the other moves, protecting the e5 square.} 24. Rfe1 {Then by putting my f1 rook to e1, I would defend the e5 pawn.} c6 {It is another strange move...} 25. Rac1 {Connected rooks, one of them attacks the opponent's Queen. The Queen often goes away... } Qxh3 {...Like now, again far from his king.} 26. Qd8+ {And I attack! 2 options: Bd7 or Ke5. -if Bd7: e5 is very devastating! -if Ke5: exd5+, he moves away, Q can take on e7...} Bd7 {The wrong move... } 27. e5# {Not dealing with the a8 rook, I can finally give a checkmate, which I don't want to delay. I think Black's mistakes was that he went for material advantage, he didn't developed many pieces, all he had in play was his Queen with some pawns and a knight or a bishop. But you can see, in my 20th move I equalized and had my king in a much more better place than he had. I hope you enjoyed my annotation. Goodbye: Matepok}
