1. e4 {Some of my readers will know, that when one of the lovely ladies in the "sixth sense" team ask me to annotate a game for them, I find it very hard to resist! So this is a favour for the lovely Laura, also known as penelope80. So she starts conventionally.} a6 {But this is a very unusual reply, although the English grandmaster Tony Miles used it once to beat World Chess Champion Karpov. I knew Tony Miles well at Sheffield University. I could have played him, but chose to play him at Backgammon instead - he still beat me! Laura fails to make the mistakes former world champion Karpov did. Instead she plays sensible developing moves, taking control of the centre.} 2. d4 {Laura replies sensibly. This e4-d4 pawn centre is very strong, controlling the squares c5, d5, e5 and f5.} b5 {I guess this is a logical follow-up to a6.} 3. Nf3 {Laura continues her development. This is another good move by her.} e6 {This is a reasonable developing move.} 4. a4 {Laura immediately challenge's Black's queen-side set-up. Taking on b5 is a nasty threat, as after axb5, Black cannot take back as the rook on a8 would be taken by the rook on a1.} b4 {Which Black avoids.} 5. Bd3 {Laura wisely continues her development.} Bb7 {Black develops the bishop.} 6. O-O {White tucks her king away to safety. This is another excellent move by the Italian Lady.} a5 {Black secures the b4 pawn, but this is yet another non-developing move. c4 or Nf6 seem better, or even Be7.} 7. c3 {This adds extra protection to d4. White now has a very solid centre. She is playing well.} c5 {So Black tries to undermine it.} 8. Re1 {Another sensible developing move, proving once again that she is not just a pretty face, but has brains as well as beauty. This position was reached in m422 (1715) vs. domowoj (1773) when Black chose 8....Qb6 and managed to go on and win. This time Black chooses a different path, with a different result.} Nf6 {Black develops the knight instead.} 9. Bg5 {Laura pins it. As the bishop drops back to f4 next move, maybe it was better to play it straight to f4. What do you think dear reader?} h6 {Black attacks the Bishop.} 10. Bf4 {Bishop drops back. I personally think that white has wasted a move and would have been better off developing the bishop to f4 immediately.} d6 {Black, with the king still in the centre, wisely tries to keep the centre closed.} 11. dxc5 {But Laura opens it up a bit, a clever plan, considering Black's king is still in the centre.} dxc5 {Black takes back.} 12. Qe2 {White wisely avoids the exchange of queens. With the queens off the board, it is much harder to take advantage of Black's king in the centre.} Nbd7 {Black develops.} 13. Nbd2 {So does White. Post match computer analysis (PMCA) gives this move as a mistake, - the first it gives of the game - and suggest the line 13. Bb5 g5 14. Be5 Ke7 15. Rd1 Nxe5 16. Rxd8 Nxf3+ 17. gxf3 Rxd8 18. e5 Nh5 19. Nd2 Nf4 20. Qe3 as better. However I can't see much wrong with this fairly natural development.} Nh5 {Black hits the white bishop.} 14. Be3 {Bishop drops back, avoiding exchanges, which is exactly the right strategy if, like white enjoys here, you have a space advantage.} g5 {This aggressive pawn thrust is to my mind a bit over-optimistic. Be7 followed by 0-0 seems sounder to my mind.} 15. Bb5 {Laura produces a powerful pin. This is an excellent move.} Bd6 {PMCA gives this as a mistake, and instead suggests  Nhf6 16. Ne5 Qc7 17. Ndc4 Bxe4 18. Red1 Rd8 19. cxb4 axb4 20. Nxd7 Nxd7 21. Bxc5 Bd5, but the position was quite hard for Black.} 16. Nc4 {Knight advances, attacking bishop. This is another good move by the talented Italian player.} Bc7 {The bishop drops back.} 17. Bxc5 {Laura cleverly takes advantage of the pin on the knight on d7 to win a valuable pawn. The knight on d7 can't take the bishop on c5 because of the bishop on b5 pinning the knight.} Nf4 {Knight comes in to attack the white queen.} 18. Qe3 {So the queen moves. As the knight on d7 is pinned, and the pin is very hard to get out of, maybe Qd2 is even stronger - still keeping an eye on the knight on f4, but also perhaps preparing to gang up on the knight on d7 with Ra1-d1, and, if Black allows it, Nf3-e5. I think in some variations, pressure on d7 can be stepped up with Nc4-b6 too. Black is quite tied up here already!} g4 {This is another mistake, driving the knight on f3 to the square it wants to go anyway, and also unprotecting the one active piece in the Black army - the knight on f4. A truely dreadful move.} 19. Nfe5 {This is by far the best move white could have played in this position. White now has two pieces attacking the knight on d7. 19..... Bc8 is the only way to fight on, although white has a huge advantage now - she has handled this off-beat and tricky defence by Black very well indeed.  The knight on f4 is unprotected to add to Black's problems. Black cannot protect both knights. } Qg5 {Black protects the knight, but seems to have missed something..... what would you play as White now?} 20. Bxd7+ {White is very clever and takes the knight with the bishop, with check. The only move the king can move to is d8, when Nxf7 check forks the king and queen. It is hopeless for Black, and Black resigned. White could have also taken on d7 with the knight, but this is much more effective! Many thanks for reading my annotation! Please comment, rate it on the star system, and until next time dear reader!}
