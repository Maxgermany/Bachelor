1. e4 c5 2. d4 Nc6 {Black clumsily attempts to transpose to the Orthodox Sicilian, having no experience with the Sicilian Center Game. cxd4 is obviously the better move.} 3. dxc5 e5 {Black seeks to avoid 3. .. e6 4. Nf3 Bxc5 e5, which could inhibit his development, and prepares to recoup the pawn.  Black rejected 3. .. Qa5+ 4. .. Qxc5 as too risky.  Didn't notice 3. .. e6 4. Nf3 d6, but that doesn't seem superior.} 4. Nf3 Bxc5 {Black recoups the pawn immediately to open a chance for a queenside fianchetto.} 5. Bc4 {White threatens f7, two moves away from checking or forking the Queen and Rook.} Qa5+ {Black interrupts with a check, hoping to lure White into a trap:  6. .. Bxf2!? 7. Kxf2? Qc5+ 8. .. Qxc4, preventing castling and gaining a pawn.  If White doesn't capture, Black's position is more tenuous.} 6. Bd2 {I think c3 -might- be better.  Not sure.} Bxf2+ {Black prevents castling and gains a pawn, though if White doesn't capture, Black's situation gets more complicated.} 7. Kxf2 Qc5+ 8. Be3 {White's best move.  Other options sacrifice more pieces, block the h1 Rook, or lose another tempo.} Qxc4 {Black completes the exchange.} 9. Na3 {White develops the Knight to dislodge Black's queen.} Qa6 {Black believed all other squares give White more chances to gain time through additional attacks on the queen.} 10. Qd5 {I didn't see what White gained from this.  The rooks can form up on the d-file, but he loses a tempo having to move his queen.  I believed it might be a clever trap, because the Nf6 response is so obvious that I thought he wouldn't move it there without a purpose.  Maybe he miscalculated the c7 fork attempt exchange?  As it turns out, it was clearly a mistake.} Nf6 {The obvious reply.} 11. Qd3 {White's Queen retreats and offers an exchange.} Qxd3 {Accepted.  Black didn't see a way to save his queen without getting into a very bad position.} 12. cxd3 Ng4+ {With the tempo granted by White's Qd5, Black forks White's King and Bishop, hoping to weaken White's control of the center.} 13. Ke2 Nxe3 14. Kxe3 {White's position, though seemingly exposed, is a lot stronger than Black anticipated.} a6 {A mistake.  Black attempts to prevent White advancing towards a Nc7 fork.  Avoiding it would require castling immediately and then moving the a8 rook to a useless position, while White's knight would securely prevent Re8.  Black seeks to avoid all of that.} 15. Nc4 {15. Nc4!  White threatens a Nb6 fork of the Rook and Bishop -and- a Nd6 fork between the King and Bishop, which would cost Black the ability to castle.  I saw only these two possibilities, but White soon demonstrated a third.} O-O 16. Nfxe5 {White catches Black completely flat-footed, regaining parity while maintaining the threat to the Rook and Bishop.  I begin to suspect I will lose or at best force a draw, but there is still hope.} Nxe5 {After looking at various exchanges, Black captures on e5, believing that whether White forks or exchanges Knights, he can at least maintain material equality.  I was also hoping for an opportunity to draw aside White's defending pawns: I hadn't expected exchanging queens on d3 to leave White's King protected in the center this way.} 17. Nxe5 b5 {Preventing the Knight from returning to c4 to threaten a fork of a8 and c8 again.} 18. Rhf1 {White takes advantage of the half-open f-file to double the pressure on f7.  Black's f8 rook is effectively pinned to the pawn's defense.} f6 {Dislodging White's Knight from the center of the board.} 19. Nf3 d5 {Chosen over 19. .. Bb7 because Black wants to pull the e-pawn off, not capture on e4.} 20. exd5 Bb7 {Black's Queen Bishop finally develops.} 21. Kd4 {Completely surprised me.  I was almost certain White would take advantage of the moves needed to recapture on d5 to put himself in a "false castle" on g1 or at least retreat to behind the d3 pawn. I thought that with the fortified center gone, White's king was vulnerable and on the run.} Rad8 22. Kc3 Bxd5 {Recapturing with the rook seemed risky.} 23. b3 {I realized two things: 1) White's king's presence prevented a queen-side pawn advance without considerable support from the pieces I wanted exerting control over the center.  2) White's pieces were better disposed to support a race to promotion, especially the d3 pawn.} g5 {It was necessary to preempt exchanges opening up White's a1 Rook and advancing the queenside pawns or Black would lose the initiative.  g5 closed off another Kingside square to White's Knight.  After the multiple fork threats on the queenside, I was shy of opening up another opportunity for a Knight run amok.} 24. Kb4 {White demonstrates that unsupported Black pawns can make an effective barrier.  I thought the goal was to support a pawn breakthrough.} g4 {Black believed a strong threat was necessary to prevent his Queen-side pawns from falling.} 25. Nh4 {Probably the the best square.  Nd4 would have led to Bxg2.  Saving the Rook would lead to Rxd4+, allowing the Bishop to escape and yielding Black a pawn-minor piece advantage.  I was hoping for that, but no such luck.} Kg7 {At the time, this Long March made sense to me.  I thought White would take advantage of the White King's vulnerability to offer check at each step of the way, being forced to withdraw by its (hopefully surprising) continuing advance.  Instead, White took control of the e-file, defended the knight, and raised the possibility of its rooks doubling.  I don't know -why- I stuck with it, except that stopping the advance would give White a check in hand, ready to use whenever needed.} 26. Rf2 Kh6 27. Re1 Kg5 28. g3 {I had still hoped for the attractive-looking blunder 28. Rf5.} f5 {I saw 29. Rf5+ looming, forcing Kh6.} 29. Re5 {I did _not_ see this. This threat to remove my pawn cover would involve seriously damaging exchanges, but running would cause serious problems, too.} Bf3 {I couldn't see any way to avoid losing pieces, so I tried to maintain parity.  The f5 pawn would remain and the knight would be gone.  I felt that losing only a pawn in preventing what I thought could lead to a mating attack wasn't so bad.} 30. Nxf3+ gxf3 31. Rxf3 Rf6 {Makes doubled-rook defense of f5 possible.  Once the King has moved, it also brings a doubled-rook threat to d3 into play.  31. .. Rd4+ seemed merely to give White the opportunity for Ka5, requiring the a6 pawn to be constantly guarded and factored into any exchange at f5.  31. .. Kg4 may be superior.} 32. h3 {White seals off Kg4 and raises the threat of g4, gaining another pawn.} Kg6 {Black retreats to release the pin on the f5-pawn without blocking the h-pawn.} 33. a4 {The queenside attack begins, but delicately: White seeks an open avenue for the b-pawn without exposing the King to check.  For now, that means getting to the a-file and leaving the a6 pawn unmolested.} bxa4 34. Kxa4 h5 {Black doesn't want 35. g4 to draw off the f5 pawn, or to face the possibility of the h-pawn advancing, possibly under the protection of a withdrawn Rook from e5.} 35. h4 Rd4+ {I wanted to force an exchange somehow.  My position seemed too tenuous, while I could emerge from a good exchange at a roughly equal position but with fewer balls in the air.  I also hoped to be able to use my King more aggressively if the position opened up more.} 36. b4 f4 {I wasn't sure White would go for it.  I thought that 37. Rg5+ would precede the actual exchange, leaving me in a worse position, but even that seemed preferable to the lockdown around f5.} 37. gxf4 Rdxf4 38. Rxf4 Rxf4 39. Re4 {White seeks a further Rook exchange.  After 39. .. Rxe4 40. dxe4, Black's king couldn't advance to remove the h4 pawn via f5, since the d4 pawn would be guarding it.  Black would thus have no hope of making it in time to prevent a White promotion on the b-file, even if the King bagged two pawns.} Rf6 {Black returns to defending a3.} 40. Kb3 {I thought White intended to support both the d-pawn and the Rook's advance with his King, but given his later moves, I'm no longer certain what White's plans were.} Kf5 {Black moves to a position threatening White's Rook.  From this position, the d3 pawn cannot advance without losing the Rook.  It would take the White King's support to push forward.} 41. Kc4 {Still advancing.  From e3, the King could protect the Rook while the pawn moves to d4.} Rg6 {The Rook pivots around the King.  Still defending a6, it now also threatens  42. .. Rg4.} 42. Kb3 {White's King can't support the Rook without leaving the b-pawn vulnerable.  Perhaps that is why the King retreated?} Rg4 {This seemed silly to me on the face of it: rooks exchange, White has three pawns left, and Black's King can't stop them all.  In a way, it's the mirror-image of the exchange White offered with 39. Re4.  White would still come out winning in terms of body-count.  The difference: Black's pawn advances beyond capturing with an exchange on g4.  If White refuses the exchange, Black can move to threaten the pawn at d3 and thus White's Rook.} 43. Rxg4 {Taking the exchange.  White had just offered one, after all.} hxg4 {Black's pawn can beat any White pawn in the race to promotion and will outpace any effort by White's King to capture immediately following promotion.  The only pawn that can "tie" is h4, but Black has time to intercept with the King without risking the g-pawn advance.  Barring astronomical errors, Black wins.} 44. d4 g3 {White recognizes that the race is lost and resigns.  Many mistakes were made.  Preventing the King from castling strengthened White's center.  Black was forced to make exchanges that weakened his relative position to hold out this long.  In the end, it was a mistake that allowed Black to win.  With perfect play by both sides, I believe this would have been a draw, but as you can see, there is no perfect play in this game.  I hope it is an instructional low-rating match.}
