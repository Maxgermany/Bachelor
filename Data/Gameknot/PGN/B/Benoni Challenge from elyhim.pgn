[Opening "Blumenfeld counter-gambit (E10)"]

1. d4 {Queens pawn. } Nf6 {While we agreed to play the Benoni, Elyhim indicated opening with the knight in this fashion disguises the opening and allows for variation.} 2. c4 {White moves to control the center. Provides little indication of black's intent.} e6 {Still disguising the Modern Benoni, but leaving the option to transition it other openings. } 3. Nf3 {White develops the knight and protects his central position.} c5 {Now we are clear, full on Benoni.} 4. d5 {White does not want to exchange a flank pawn for a central pawn, so advances} exd5 {Take} 5. cxd5 {Take} d6 {This would appear to give white an advantage. D6 appears to be a weak pawn that white will attempt to capitalize on, without success.} 6. Nc3 {Normal development.} g6 {Black prepares the DSB for fianchetto. This bishop appears to be key to this defense.} 7. Bf4 {White opens up the attack on d6, perhaps a bit too soon.} Bg7 {Black continues his plan for the DSB powerhouse.} 8. Qa4+ {Seemed like a good idea, but in actual practice helps black develop the weak bishop and loses a tempo.} Bd7 {Black defends and threatens. However, the pawn on b7 is now weak.} 9. Qb3 {Queen retreats and threatens b7. In addition, shores up the d5 defense. Elyhim warned me of his intent to advance the b pawn at this point in the game.} b5 {Black responds with an advance.} 10. a3 {I debated moving Nxb5 here instead and perhaps should have made that move, but it left the d5 pawn vulnerable and I did not want to give up the central pawn. In addition, I wanted to stop the b5 advance based on discussion Elyhim had with me regarding his goal here. The a3 and b5 pawn stay in this position for the remainder of the game, cramping the Queen side white pieces quite a bit.} c4 {Threatening the white queen, black is intent on advancing the Queen side pawns.} 11. Qb4 {I've never been a fan of retreating, so I move the Queen to block the b advance and threaten the d6 pawn.} O-O {I expected Na6, one of many moves I did not anticipate during this game. Black castles to open the e8 square to push the Queen around when I take on d6. The black fortress is well established and white's King is still centered. Analysis shows white slightly ahead here, but not for long.} 12. g3 {Unfortunately, I changed my strategy and decided to attack from the flank. I do enjoy fianchetto attacks and thought perhaps I could use this here to threaten the Queen side. I have learned (not well enough yet) when I change my strategy I usually don't fair well. I should have taken the d6 pawn here.} Ne8 {Black supports the d6 pawn, the white advantage is lost. The black DSB rules the diagonal and threatens the knight on c3.} 13. Nb1 {White makes room for the inevitable Queen escape.} Na6 {The threat I expected earlier.} 14. Qd2 {Queen retreats to support the d6 pawn, the b2 pawn, and setup the diagonal threat with the DSB. The Queen is defensively overloaded. Although advanced, the black Queen side pawn storm seems to be held at bay for the moment. Black will need to find another way in. White will focus on defense from this point forward.} Nc5 {...enter the knights. This move exposed a nasty looking fork at b3 I hadn't seen.. In fact, this game is riddled with forks from this point.} 15. Ra2 {Evading the fork, while defending the a3 & b2 pawns. The white a rook is pretty much static for now.} Bf5 {Threatening the weakest piece on the white side.} 16. Qd1 {Queen must move to protect. I would value opinions on Nc3 instead. Ugly fork getting setup at c3. The knight at b1 must stay put.} Na4 {Two attackers on b2 now and threatens the fork.} 17. Bg2 {B2 is lost, I move to castle.} Nxb2 {Takes and forces a queen move} 18. Qc1 {Best move I think.} Na4 {Retreats} 19. Bd2 {I decide to take another crack at d6} c3 {Denied, now the bishop is lost. Until the bishop move I think I was doing ok at only -1. Look at how influential the black DSB is at this point. Really supports the attack.} 20. O-O {Finish what I started, while I'm down now and likely lost, I take comfort in a very cool looking fianchetto castle. Definitely prolonged the game a few moves.} cxd2 {Ouch.} 21. Nfxd2 {The Knights stay here for most of the rest of the game. I like this configuration. I only wish it was closer to the other side of the board.} Rc8 {White brings the rook into play. The white fianchetto seems a waste of time now, although it protects the d6 pawn.} 22. Qd1 {Evade and provide another reason to not advance b5} Nf6 {Black is bringing his knight forward. Elyhim indicated that active knights in the Benoni are worth a rook.} 23. e4 {Advancing the king side to try and activate a white offense. I intend on moving my pawns up the board.} Bd7 {Evades and moves back to support the Queen side attack.} 24. Kh1 {I intend on moving the f2 pawn and don't want to pin it. I'd rather move the king on my terms than be forced to do it at black's whim.} Ng4 {Never like it when my opponent parks a knight above the fianchetto. However, i intend on kicking it. However, must protect the pawn first.} 25. Qe2 {Queen defends the pawn against the inevitable Qb6} Qb6 {Absolutely } 26. f3 {*kick*} Ne5 {I decided here that elyhim had plans beyond what I thought for the e5 knight.} 27. f4 {*kick*} Nc4 {I expected Bg4, so this was a bit surprising. I always worry when I see opponent Knights close to each other behind my pawns. Another fork at e3 (rook & bishop)... Ne3 is bad news for white, so...} 28. Re1 {I always like it when my queen and rook line up, but there doesn't seem to be much to do with it here.} f5 {Game closing move I think. } 29. Bh3 {My bishop was inactive, so the pawn allowed me to use it for something.} Rfe8 {Mounting pressure on e4} 30. Rc2 {Pinned the knight. At this point, I believe white already knows he will trade in both his rooks.} Nc5 {More e4 pressure} 31. Qf1 {Taking the Queen out of harms way and backing up the bishop. Another nasty fork at e3} Qb7 {More e4 pressure} 32. Bg2 {Lining up the bishop to defend e4} fxe4 {And the attack begins} 33. Nxe4 {Take} Nxe4 {Take } 34. Rxe4 {Take} Ne3 {Another fork!!} 35. Rxc8 {Sacrificing the Queen for a couple of rooks} Qxc8 {Slowed the fork down, but didn't stop it} 36. Rxe8+ {Exchange the rook} Bxe8 {Take} 37. Qe1 {The end is near now, the question is can I make it to 50 moves?} Nxg2 {Take} 38. Kxg2 {Take} Qc2+ {The bishops lie in wait to finish the game, but I'm going to put up the good fight here.} 39. Nd2 Bf7 {Bishops lining up} 40. Kf2 {I've been told it's always best to move king center at the end} Bd4+ 41. Ke2 {Keep on trying} Bxd5 {Yikes!} 42. Kf1 {So much for center} Kf8 {Waiting move} 43. Ke2 {Waiting move} Bc4+ {Here it comes} 44. Kf3 {Trying to stay close to center, will be impossible for long. Trying to make 50 moves now!} Qd3+ {Closing in} 45. Kg2 {Evade} Bd5+ 46. Kh3 {Evade} h5 {Think I might make 50, a personal record against this master opponent!} 47. Qd1 {Keeping the pawns from doing the deed, the black queen will have to get her hands dirty} Qf5+ {And she's up to it.} 48. g4 Qxf4 {Making her work for it} 49. Nf3 {Blunder!} Qxg4# {Didn't make 50, but oh so close! Thanks for the game Elyhim, excellent mentor in Benoni. i haven't defended that many forks in a single game since I started playing! Until next time!}
