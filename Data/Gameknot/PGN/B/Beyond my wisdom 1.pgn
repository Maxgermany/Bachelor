[Opening "QGD Slav (D15), 4.Nc3"]

1. d4 {Grandmaster's moves are often far away from my skills. If you like, help me explaining why they go like that. } d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 {This move is theory, so it must be ok, of course. I would have preferred to get the black's lsb out before it, but I think it is a matter of personal choice. The bishop out of the pawn chain gets eventually exchanged, but at a cost for white, if he goes for it, or it keeps controlling the good white diagonal, otherwise. I think it keeps more control of the game, but I know this is not so easy. Can experts say something about this?} 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bh4 dxc4 {This transforms the game in a kind of accepted queen gambit, except some other moves are played. The accepted queen gambit is not played anymore (routinely), so my question is: what makes it playable now? The c6 pawn?} 7. e4 g5 {Avoiding the pin from e5. All this looks very "normal", till now. } 8. Bg3 b5 {So white as an advantage in developement, but gets a less flexible position, while black has more space and a lot of "good attacking moves", once he develps (white's lsb can go just to e2, and black has it easy starting either with b4 or g4, after some manouvers).} 9. Be2 Bb7 10. Qc2 Nbd7 11. Rd1 {White uses his developement advantage to bring in firepower.} Nh5 {Black wants to get rid of the dsb, that controls a very good diagonal. Probably he felt that Bg7 could be countered by Bd6 someway.} 12. d5 {But it allows this central advance. The problem of it is the weakening of black's kingside, if black allows dxe6 - fxe6. Because it seems easy for white exploit the "hole" in g6 - but not inmediately. Black has a potential semiopen f file in reutrn. Now, before Nh5, all this must have been calculated, and the games' continuation shows that black went, in fact, for the semiopen f column. I wouldn't, but who am I? And what do experts think?} Nxg3 13. hxg3 Qb6 {? This is a comment by the page I took the game from. They recommend Bg7, stating that this move is a blunder because "mixes two different systems". It certainly allows purposefully, exd6, fxe6, but if white goes for e5, threatening Qg6+, black has o-o-o and the f column. On the other side, white has the semi open h file. But white can play Nxg5, and this weakens its position too much, in my view, so my question is: had black overlooked it? } 14. dxe6 {So white goes for it. } fxe6 15. Nxg5 {Now, if o-o-o, Nf7 forking the rooks. If Bg7, Nxd6. So I cannot see black's plan, but I cannot believe Shirov has played this without a plan. What do you think?} Bc5 {It looks like a "naive" attack. } 16. Bh5+ {Not difficult to see this. It defends f2, and avoids black's castling. } Ke7 {Was this position part of black's plan? Now he calculated probably that white's knight had to fly, and f7 doesn't look as a good square, so Nf3 and black can Ra-f8, adding pressure to white's kingside. But...} 17. Nxe6 {If KxN, Bg4+, then the Nd7 is taken, with deadly consecuences. This is not difficult to see, but probably it was when Shirov entered this path. Do you agree?} Ne5 {Threatening Nd3+, KxN (now it is possible), but giving away the very strong bishop on c5.} 18. Nxc5 {This also avoids the d3 check, so black has to recapture.} Qxc5 19. Be2 {And the d3 check is covered. True is black has an attacking position for his pawn. Now b4, and white has to move the knight, say Na4, Qa5, say o-o, say c5 or b3 or c3... this is the path for black, or not? What do you think?} Raf8 {Shirov went the other way. This, again, looks kind of "naive", but who am I to say that?} 20. O-O {Right into the pin. Now black has h5, but I still think the right attack would have been on the queenside. What do you think?} Rhg8 {Supporting Ng4, probably. } 21. b4 {! Comment by the reviewer as the winning move for white. I always say: "attack the strongest way you can, as soon as possible. If you don't your opponent will". Now, c4xb3 (e.p.) is impossible because of Nd5+, winning the black queen. Not difficult to see. Being black, I would have played Qb6, that maintains the "status quo". What do you think?} Qxb4 22. Qd2 {This threats again Nd5+, so black has to do something, losing the h6 pawn and, more important, allowing the white queen to enter into the fight. Was this an overlook by black? Or was it part of his plan? Nd3, defending the queen was not a solution (BxN and black has to cope with the same threat as before). } Qc5 {Status quo restored, but at the cost of h6. } 23. Qxh6 {Now, it seems that black has to be very careful about the white queen, and a plan could have been Rg6, or Nf7 (covering d8 and d6 too!). After it, the black queen can go to the kingside, be exchanged with the white queen, and black has a pawn less but a playable game. Or maybe am I too superficial?} Bc8 {So I will question this move, instead. Ok, it tries to redeploy the lsb, but it proved to be not enough. } 24. Qh4+ {Eyeing d8.} Ke6 25. Qh6+ {I cannot see the purpose of this check. } Ke7 26. Qh5 {This invites black to think hard on moves such as Nd3 or Bg4.  If 26... Nd3, 27. QxQ NxQ doesn't seem a bad way for black to stabilize the game (a pawn race will be set, probably won by white, but it would be another game). Alternatively, 27. BxN is impossible, but RxN is. Then QxQ, 28. BxQ, cxRd3 and it has to be evaluated if the d3 pawn is a real threat for white. It certainly can be easily supported by the rooks, and by the c6 pawn in a few moves.  As for 26... Bg4, if 27. BxB, RxB I don't see a clear win for white. What do you think?} Kf6 {This move is beyond my understanding. Bd6 would have been my choice, but again, who am I?} 27. Qh4+ Ke6 {Repeating position. But now white has another good plan: } 28. Nd5 {...threatening Nc7+, Kf7, and then Qf4+, or Bh5+ with devastating consecuences.  } cxd5 29. Rxd5 Qb6 30. Qh5 Qb8 {"Routine" attack here.} 31. Rfd1 Rf6 {Overlooks...} 32. Rxe5+ {And here Shirow resigned. It follows: } Qxe5 33. Bg4+ {Now, if RxB, Qe8# (!). If the king moves, QxQ. The only other one is Rf5, losing it cleanly but...} Rf5 34. Bxf5+ Ke7 35. Qh7+ Qg7 36. Qxg7+ Rxg7 37. Bxc8 {And black's pawns can do nothing. The bishop will sac for them and the white pawns will win. }
