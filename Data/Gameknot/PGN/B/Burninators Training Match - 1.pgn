1. e4 {I am annotating this game for the benefit of my team, the Burninators, and especially for my teammate, esegromal.} c5 {In the Sicilian defense, per Kasparov, one of the biggest challenges for white is to deal with the two center pawns for black.  White's challenge is to neutralize those pawns and black's challenge is to not trade them away cheaply.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Fairly standard progression so far.  Nothing out of the ordinary.} 5. Nc3 e5 {This move has good instinct, in that it is designed to stake a claim to the center and force me to move my knight.  Any piece that has reach into your side of the board should be viewed with extreme caution.  If you allow pieces to stick around, they can have long-term consequences to your game play.} 6. Ndb5 {Instead of retreating I decide to invade a little deeper into Black's territory.  A pair of mutually protected knights is a good thing.} d5 {A wrong move here can spell some problems for my side if I'm not careful.  If I choose not to take the d5 pawn, then he can advance the pawn one space and force me to move my knight around while staking a strong claim to the center.  However, I have three options at this point.  I can take with the knight, take with the pawn, or move my bishop to g5 to pin his knight against his queen, allowing me to move my knight to the d5 square (provided he doesn't pin my own knight with a reciprocal Bb4).  To avoid all of those pin issue, I prefer to take with the e pawn.} 7. exd5 Nb4 {If black had decided to immediately retake with his f6 knight instead, I would have won a knight in the process.  This is an interesting response and I think is worthy of discussion.  As this now stand black has three attackers and I have 2 defenders.  I could potentially move my bishop to c4 to protect, but I see problems down that road.  With proper analysis though, black is potentially in trouble if I give a little nudge.  } 8. a3 {Now black has some poor options, and ultimately he moves the b knight to retake the d pawn.  If black had instead decided to move to a6 I would have gotten a decent amount of advantage in development and could have added more pressure to his exposed king, BUT it would have been better than this move, which I will categorize as a mistake.} Nbxd5 {if instead Na6... 9.	Qe2	Bd6 (to allow castle) 10.	Nxd6+	Qxd6 (to set up pressure and force an eventual queen trade) 11.	f4	Nd7 (bringing pressure and forcing a knight move to prevent a pawn fork) 12.	fxe5	Qxe5 13.	Bf4	Qxe2+ 14.	Bxe2	O-O 15.	Bxa6	bxa6 16.	O-O  And now black is only down a pawn, but I would have three connected, passed pawns down the center of the board.} 9. Nxd5 {Black appears to have an advantage here and can regain his knight, however, my b5 knight has a nasty surprise waiting.} Nxd5 10. Qxd5 {I believe that this move is not necessarily one that you would naturally see.  Taking with a queen and leaving it hanging begs it to be taken.} Qxd5 11. Nc7+ {However the follow through to allow a queen/king split is damning.  Not only has black lost the ability to castle with a very exposed king, but now he is down a knight as well.  Not a good place to be if you're black.} Kd8 12. Nxd5 Bf5 {Perhaps it might have been better to move the bishop to e6 and force me to move my knight?  Moving the bishop to f5 invites me to move my knight to the e3 square, protecting the c2 pawn and attacking the bishop.} 13. Ne3 Bd7 {Again, I think that e6 would have been a better spot for the bishop, then black could ahve moved Rc1 to put some pressure on my queenside.  The other downside at this point is that I can potentially pin his bishop against his king.} 14. Bd2 {Preparing for a queenside castle.} f6 {Better to get rooks and bishops into play.} 15. O-O-O f5 16. Bc3 {Pinning the bishop} e4 {First priority should be to move the king away from the bishop pin to prevent my next move.} 17. Bb5 Kc7 18. Be5+ {Often times players are keen to grab advantages where they can and will immediately retake or take the prize.  Bringing additional pieces into the fray is often of greater strategic value and should not be neglected.  Do not throw away the chance to grab a piece or retake just to gain position, but do not immediately retake or take because you can.  Analyze the board and see where you can smartly develop an attack.} Kb6 {Not many good choices left.} 19. Bxd7 {Now the king is in a dangerous location, since I have four pieces bearing down on his position, including two bishops.} h5 {A belated desire to get his rook into the game.  Instead of moving pawns in the early middle game, bring your pieces into the battle and try and connect your rooks if possible.  Now when Black's king is alone and nearly defenseless, it is too late to try and build your defenses.} 20. Nd5+ Kc5 21. b4+ Kc4 22. Ne3# {Overall black started out well, but perhaps did not see the value of the exchange.  The big mistake was moving the pawn to d5.  With proper play, the best response forward would have been 6.	Ndb5	d5 7.	exd5	a6 8.	dxc6	Qxd1+ 9.	Nxd1	axb5 10.	cxb7	Bxb7 11.	Bxb5+	 and now black is down 2 pawns, cannot castle, and has a very exposed king.  Still not good, but better than the alternative I think.}
