1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 {[%clk 0:05:06] Not a normal start. Let's see what he does after... } h6 3. Bxf6 gxf6 {[%clk 0:05:07] ...so I'll see if I'm able to handle this and turn it to my advantage.  } 4. e3 {[%clk 0:05:13] Passive play! I know the taget is h5.  } e5 {[%clk 0:05:05] I don't leave him so easily.  } 5. Nf3 {[%clk 0:05:10] Even better for me! } e4 6. Nfd2 {[%clk 0:05:10] Nh4 was more in the spirit of taking advantage of the lack of my g pawn.  } f5 {[%clk 0:05:09] Now I have a stronger center, don't I? And my pieces have easy developement routes, except my lsb. Too bad.  } 7. Qh5 Qg5 {[%clk 0:05:06] Of course! White has no chance than to retreat or... } 8. Qxg5 hxg5 {[%clk 0:05:10] Who do you think has an edge, here? } 9. c4 Nc6 10. a3 Bg7 {[%clk 0:05:01] I decided to wait for his pawns and threat c5 later.  } 11. Nc3 a6 {[%clk 0:05:03] Preventing Nb5. I don't intend to castle, of course!!! } 12. Nd5 {[%clk 0:04:48] No problem, I was just tempting him in doing this too early.  } Kd8 13. O-O-O {[%clk 0:04:39] Unwise castling... } Ne7 {[%clk 0:04:56] Now white has to help me... } 14. Nxe7 {[%clk 0:04:29] Yes, very kind from his.  } Kxe7 {[%clk 0:04:59] Thank you, white... Now the situation is much easier for me. } 15. Nb3 d6 16. c5 Be6 {[%clk 0:05:01] Of course I won't start the exchange, I expect him to do (he shouldn't). But this move puts him in danger.  } 17. Na5 b6 {[%clk 0:04:51] If Nc6+, Kd7 and he N is lost.  } 18. cxb6 cxb6 {[%clk 0:04:53] Same as before, but with Rc8+ in sight. } 19. Nc4 Rhc8 {[%clk 0:04:52] I wanted to get the N pinned before he could move it. But this allows d5. On the other side, if I play Bd5 so to block the pawn's advance, He has time to move the K or the N.  } 20. d5 {[%clk 0:03:56] Here I missed Bxd5. After RxB, Ke6, the R has to retreat, and then d5 renews the threat. Even so, I got action for my dsb. } Bd7 21. Kb1 Rab8 {[%clk 0:04:47] Nxb6 will promote exchanges, I don't want them.  } 22. h4 {[%clk 0:03:40] I can react or ignore it.  } b5 23. Na5 b4 {[%clk 0:04:21] If Nc6+, BxN, dxB, bxa3.  } 24. Nc4 {[%clk 0:02:39] Here I missed RxN!, and if BxR, bxa3 should be a winner. Instead I went for the slower... } bxa3 25. Nxa3 Rc3 {[%clk 0:04:15] I'm sure he didn't expect this move from a 1390 player... :-) } 26. Nc4 {[%clk 0:02:18] Again, RxN gives me advantage. But I played the even more sadistic... } Bb5 {[%clk 0:04:00] Unpinning the pawn. But I swear that after bxR, BxN+ will lead to mate or near so.  } 27. Rc1 {[%clk 0:02:19] He definitely fears my attack. Ok... } Rxc1+ 28. Kxc1 Bxc4 29. Bxc4 Rxb2 {[%clk 0:03:40] I think this is stronger than Bxb2+. This also invites white to a last trick! } 30. Bxa6 {[%clk 0:02:00] ? This will bind white in a bad way... } Ra2 31. Bf1 {[%clk 0:01:40] Only place to save the B.} Ra1+ 32. Kd2 gxh4 {[%clk 0:03:50] ... and now the R can take the pawn at the cost of a B. Here, white thought about defend the B so to be free to move the R, and played... } 33. Ke2 {[%clk 0:01:27] ? ...and with this innocent move, the game is LOST after ONE black move. Can you find it? "Stop the video if you want, and find the right move." :-) } Bc3 {[%clk 0:03:40] White is near-zugzwanged... } 34. Rxh4 {As elwoos kindly notes, I missed checkmate in one here. I'm being very polite with my opponent here... } Ra2+ { } 35. Kd1 { } Rxf2 {[%clk 0:03:43] ...or Rd2+, winning d5. But this will be always there... } 36. Rf4 { } Rd2+ { } 37. Kc1 { } Rxd5 {[%clk 0:03:47] ...defending f4. Now, it should be a piece of cake. It should be.  } 38. g4 {[%clk 0:00:49] White is desperate or careless, and allows the following, too tempting sequence:  } Bd2+ 39. Kc2 { } Bxe3 { } 40. Rxf5 { } Rxf5 { } 41. gxf5 { } Kf6 {[%clk 0:03:48] Busted. Right? } 42. Bh3 { } Ke5 { } 43. Kd1 { } f6 44. Ke2 Bf4 45. Bg4 d5 46. Bh3 d4 47. Bg4 d3+ 48. Kd1 Kd4 49. Bh3 e3 {[%clk 0:04:15] Wrong. The K has to pass first, and stop the white B to act.  } 50. Bf1 {[%clk 0:00:49] ...but here is where even the (ehem, ehem...) best fails for overconfidence.  } e2+ {[%clk 0:04:17] ?? Allowing a draw! } 51. Bxe2 dxe2+ 52. Kxe2 Ke4 53. Kf2 Kxf5 54. Kf3 Bg5 55. Ke2 Kg4 56. Kf2 Bh4+ 57. Kg2 Bg3 58. Kh1 f5 59. Kg2 f4 60. Kg1 f3 61. Kf1 Kh3 62. Kg1 f2+ {[%clk 0:04:30] And this theorical draw, as many moves before. But... coup de scene! } 63. Kf1 {[%clk 0:01:15] ?? Losing straight away the game! Incredible... } Kh2 64. Ke2 Kg1 {}
