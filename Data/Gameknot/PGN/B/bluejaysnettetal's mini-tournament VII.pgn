[Opening "Norwegian defence (B06)"]

1. e4 g6 2. d4 c5 {As far as I know and looking on GK and 365Chess.com databases is a very rare move, since the typical second move for Black is 2. ... Bg7 (87%).} 3. d5 {Avoiding 3. Nf3 and Sicilian dragon-like formation. White gains space although give Black some advantadge on the big black diagonal.} Bg7 4. Nf3 e6 5. Nc3 d6 {(?) Allowing a fastidious check on b5 and doesn't help with the development. I judge this a strategical and tactical mistake.} 6. Bb5+ Kf8 {Not a great move, but not a great position. 6. ... Bd7 could lead to some fireworks after 7. dxe6!? Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 Bxb5 9. exf7+ Kxf7 10. Qd5+ and the exposed position of Black King maybe can compensate the loss of a light piece for a pawn.} 7. O-O a6 8. Be2 Nf6 {(?) GK computer analysis marks this as inaccuracy, f6 is no longer a good square for this Knight. The Queen "suspended" position doesn't help. Perhaps 8. ... e5 blocking the center and prepare to defend the position would be a better idea.} 9. dxe6 Bxe6 10. e5 {(!) Consequent. The Knight must go back in the 8th rank and the weakness of d6 is amplified.} Ne8 11. Bg5 {GK computer analysis suggested to continue after 8. ... Nf6 9. dxe6 Bxe6 10. e5 Ne8 with 11. Ne4, gaining a pawn. I istinctively chosed a more aggressive move, attacking the Black Queen.} Qb6 12. Nd5 {(!) Again! The b2 pawn is very poisoned (12. .. Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qxa2 14. Nb6 Ra7 15. exd6 and Black position is compromised)} Bxd5 13. Qxd5 Qc6 {Trying to exchange Queens in order to reduce the pressure.} 14. Qb3 {Ehh... no.} d5 15. Rad1 {White increases pressure on D file.} Nc7 {Protect d5 pawn... or not?} 16. Bc4 {(!) Sacrificing the bishop for a strong attack, Black's position has a bunch of weakness and is difficult to amend to all.} dxc4 17. Rd8+ Ne8 18. Qxc4 h6 {In such a tactical position is not easy to see all the possible continuation. GK computer analysis suggest: 18. ... b5 which lead White to gain the quality. Anyway after 18. ... b5 I considered better 19. Qf4 keeping the pressure on f7.} 19. e6 {Of course the Bishop is taboo since if 19. ... hxg5 then 20. exf7 followed by 21. Rxe8+ and so on. Again, it seems this was not the best move since after 19. ... b5 proposes 20. Qf4 f5 21. Bh4 and then a even position. But if 21. Ne5 Qxe6 22. Re1 hxg5 23. Nxg6+ Kf7 24. Nxh8+ Bxh8 25. Rxe6 gxf4 26. Rexe8 Bxb2 27. Rxb8 and White has two rooks vs a rook and a bishop, again White can win the quality.} f6 {Much worse than b5. And it's time for the second attacked and taboo piece!} 20. Ne5 {Attacking the Queen while menacing 21. Nxg6+. A nice series of double knight attack.} hxg5 {What else? 20. ... Qc7 is followed by 21. Nxg6+ Kg8 22. Rxe8+ and White wins. 20. ... Qb5 encounters 21. e7+ Kxe7 22. Qd5 threatening mate. After 19. ... f6 Black's Queen is lost.} 21. Nxg6+ {Check, gaining a pawn. Black King has nowhere to go except g8.} Kg8 22. Ne7+ {Again.} Kf8 23. Nxc6 Nxc6 {What else? 23. ... bxc6 wouldn't save anything after 24. Qxc5+ Kg8 25. Rxe8+Kh7 26. Qf5+ Kh6 and Black King can be chased by White pieces.} 24. Qxc5+ {Black resigns. A nice game full of tactical traps.}
