1. e4 g6 {While I know 1. e4 c5 is statistically the best response for black I've been studying the Kings Indian and various King side fianchetto openings lately and they're, I'm finding, much better suited for my style of play. Discovered attacks on my opponents queenside rook are becoming much more common. (I do want to note that as White I've been opening with g3 almost exclusively but after studying a lot of games I've now gone back to e4 though my hope most of the time is to develop into a Kings Indian or variation there of.)} 2. d4 Bg7 {He is making a strong play for center control and I'm preparing for a quick king side castle. } 3. h4 d6 {h4 here really threw me off. I don't like h4 personally... especially in this situation. Nc3, Nf3 or even c4 would probably be a much better response here. I'll sometimes play h4 if I fianchetto king side (usually in a KIA) but thats usually much later in the opening. I'm really not sure what he was trying to do here. Maybe nf3, ng5, attacking the f7 square? I played d7 defending the center and allowing for development into either a Kings Indian Fianchetto Variation or maybe a Sicillian Dragon. To be honest, I play the position I try not to pay too much attention to the openings names. I am citing them here simply because it may help others look into what I'm playing here. } 4. h5 gxh5 {I don't know why he wanted to attack so quickly at g6. I guess he was trying to destroy my protection on the king side if I were to castle early... I didn't like this move so I accepted the quick trade.} 5. Rxh5 Nf6 {Attacking the rook...} 6. Rh2 Nxe4 {I expected him to retreat but not to h2... } 7. Bh6 Bxh6 {... quick exchange} 8. Rxh6 c5 {Sicilian, attacking the center, and giving me room to develop queenside and castle.} 9. d5 Qa5+ {I love this move... I play it a lot as white playing different g2 fianchetto variations. (Qa4+ that is)} 10. Nc3 Qb6 {This was a bad move on my part, but I was kind of playing the person here. I felt comfortable sacrificing the knight. I know that it was not a good move, but for me I sometimes make plays based on reading the person. I felt confident in this move and felt that the knight wouldn't be an issue. My goal here was to get the queen side rook eventually. Sometimes when I play blitz games I base my moves on feel. Kind of like poker I felt confident I was reading my opponent here. } 11. Nxe4 Qxb2 {... waiting game} 12. Bc4 Bf5 {Not sure what his plan was for that bishop... At this point my plan was a queen side castle. Bf5 attacking the knight and the weak c2 pawn. } 13. Bb3 Bxe4 {Fischer loved the white bishop on b3 but again I'm not sure what's going on in spartacus' mind here. I'm now up +2 I believe. } 14. Qe2 Qxa1+ {Finally... Qxa1+} 15. Kd2 Qd4+ {Check... (protecting the bishop...)} 16. Kc1 Bxg2 {collecting pieces at this point... Trying to take out some of his defenses while I develop a plan. We're playing somewhat fast so I'm just trying to play safe and smart. } 17. Rxd6 Qf4+ {He moved Rd6 thinking he was collecting a free pawn becase the pawn on e7 is pinned, but he wasn't keeping track of my queen apparently... I'll now have both rooks. } 18. Qe3 Qxd6 {Noble attempt at the lesser of two evils...} 19. Ba4+ Nd7 {Check.. block} 20. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {Another useless trade...} 21. Qxc5 O-O {I saw his queen was blocked by the pawn, and at this point he had no material so the open king side was no longer a worry of mine. I castled and at this point he resigned. I enjoy looking over this game not because it was a big win (in material) but because it shows that staying really basic in your moves and trying to stick to sound principles can deliver big defeats. Look at the difference in pawn structures here...  }
