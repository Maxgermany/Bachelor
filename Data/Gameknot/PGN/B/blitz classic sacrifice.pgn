[Opening "Three knights (C46), Winawer defence (Gothic defence)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 f5 {I was aiming for a Four Knight opening, and found myself facing a complete unknown alternative (to me, I mean). It is an interesting gambit that I clearly did not take advantage of. Seems like a King´s gambit, but with black pieces, and that is supposed to be a delay black will recover with a lot of effort.} 4. Bc4 {A horrible mistake! Now 4...fxe4, 5.Nxe4, d5 creates difficulties for white. Maybe even losing a piece, not sure if it can be compensated with attack (possibly, including Nxe5, but not clear) There are (must) better ways to continue with the attack} d6 {Defending f5 and also activating Bc8. A potential long castling is on the horizon as well, in case white decides to go for the short one. An still the threat on e4 is maintained, but maybe black is considering (with good wits) to develop instead of going for a gross material gain.} 5. d3 f4 {enclosing white B in c1 and also hampering the possibilitie of a safe short castling. So I aimed for a long one, but there was a clear threat now: ...Bg4 and then Nd4 in case BQ moves to e2.} 6. Bd2 {h3 looked like an interesting defence as well. I really felt troubled with the static position WQ and WB had there in the center, therefore, 6.d4 could have been a good move too, but I didn´t consider it during the game.} Bg4 7. h3 Bh5 8. g4 {Feeling trapped I thought about releasing some pressure there, and foresaw the incoming combination after 8...fxg3.} fxg3 e.p. 9. fxg3 Nd4 {Seems like at least a lose in quality was about to happen (in case of 0-0 or similar), but for those familiar with this type of positions, you may have already seen what is coming next.} 10. Nxe5 {A classic Queen sacrifice!. In case of 10...Bxd1, 11.Bf7+ and 12. Nd5 mate.} dxe5 11. Qxh5+ g6 12. Qxe5+ Ne7 13. O-O {Increases the attack and prevents that nasty check in f3. BR in h8 is lost anyways.} Nxc2 14. Qxh8 {Yep, Bf7+ would have lead to mate by 15.Qe6++, but black has already lost the game anyways, and did not think much about it. After a few more moves, black surrendered.   The game illustrates how useful are those thematic positions learned throughout our games or study and how dangerous and king in the center is when not defended properly. I still feel bad for my poor opening scheme, but it did pay off the suffering after W 10th movement.}
