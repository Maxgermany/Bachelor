1. d4 {The first 15 moves are discussed in two of my other botvinnik (#3&4) annotations, so I'm not going to re-discuss it here.  16.Na4 is where the annotation will begin.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bg5 dxc4 6. e4 b5 7. e5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Nxg5 hxg5 10. Bxg5 Nbd7 11. exf6 Bb7 12. g3 c5 13. d5 Qb6 14. Bg2 O-O-O 15. O-O b4 16. Na4 {This is the alternative to Rb1.  Rb1 stops the knight being taken because the opening of the b file is very powerful and so that black queen goes to a6, this brings the knight out of danger with tempo.  The black queen now has the option of b5, and the value of white's knight is unclear, it might be out on the rim but it might be a useful piece in an attack as black has a lot of potential weaknesses.} Qb5 17. a3 {Questioning the pawn, if it takes (or stays where it is) white opens the a file and if it advances Nc3 comes with tempo on the black queen.} Ne5 {the move looks good, the rook starts to open up against the white queen and the knight looks actively places to threaten g4, f3 and d3, all potentially useful squares, however it's undefended and white finds an excellent way of showing it's misplacement.  The mistake isn't a strategical one, strategically this is a move black wants to make, but tactically the knight's unguarded.  Perhaps 17... exd5 as played by Shirov later is better, but Ivanchuk did get a beautiful win against him out of it with a queen sacrifice on g7 (that was apparently found over the board).} 18. axb4 {White correctly exchanges, opening the a file and giving black one less defensive pawn to block white's path.} cxb4 19. Qd4 {! This is Kamsky's brilliant find.  The knight and pawn are forked, though black has what looks like a clever response.} Nc6 {Defending the pawn, retreating the knight and white's d5 pawn is pinned to the queen... what could go wrong?} 20. dxc6 {! This queen sacrifice opens up lines while getting a defended pawn on the seventh, black gets two pieces for the queen, but the pawn on b7 will be a huge threat, and the fewer pieces in front of black's king the looser Kramnik's queenside looks.} Rxd4 21. cxb7+ Kc7 22. Be3 {The bishop was attacked, so it moves with tempo, 22.Bf4  is probably well met by 22... Rxf4 23.gxf4 Rg8 with some pressure, also remember, if white doesn't force something black can make a passed pawn with c3.} e5 {Black gives back an exchange instead of ceding tempo to white, after a rook move Bxa7-b6  would be very dangerous.} 23. Nc3 {! We've seen this kind of potential sacrifice in the 16.Rb1 lines (where the knight cannot be taken) and this has the same plan, give up a piece to open the b file against a misplaced queen or king, in this case it supports the b pawns advance as well.} bxc3 24. bxc3 {And not only does the b file get opened, but it comes with tempo!} Bc5 {A rook retreat is met Rfb1.  This move brings the h8 rook into the defense of b8 and covers d4, but the b file has not been covered, however how could he cover it?  The position is shattering and I don't believe black has a way out.} 25. cxd4 {Why not?} Bxd4 {The bishop may win tempo at some point on the a1 rook and if it's taken black will have a strong pawn dui on c4 and d4.} 26. Rfb1 Qc5 27. Ra6 {The rook moves out of the attack while perhaps threatening Rc6 .} Rb8 {Rc6  was just about unavoidable without making another HUGE concession, but it's not actually a danger yet, black will be overjoyed to give back the material 28.Rc6 ? Qxc6 29.Bxc6 Kxc6 leaves white with nothing.} 28. Bc1 {! So instead white finds a way of reorganizing his pieces so that his bishop can sneak around black's dark squared bishop via a3.  Taking on f2 doesn't help black as then he'll have the extra  worry about his loose bishop on f2 after 28... Bxf2  29.Kf1} c3 {Notice that Ba3 would have trapped(!) the black queen, he gives it breathing room.} 29. Ba3 Qc4 30. Bd6+ Kd7 31. Bc6+ {The bishop on d6 cannot be taken because of the discovery on b5.  This move is stronger that 31.Bxb8 because the a6 rook is attacked, 31.Bxb8 Qxa6 32.Bc7 c2 would give black hope.} Ke6 32. Bb5 {Winning tempo and threatening discoveries, white's rooks and bishops work together perfectly.} Bxf2+ {Where would the queen have gone, a rook is hanging with check and black would have no compensation, so he tries to draw the king into the open where the queen (and maybe rook) could have a hope of delivering stalemate.} 33. Kxf2 Qd4+ 34. Kf1 Qe4 {Attacking the b1 rook.} 35. Re1 Qh1+ 36. Kf2 Qxh2+ 37. Kf3 Rxb7 {37... Qh5  wouldn't help as after 38.Kg2 there are no more checks.} 38. Bxe5+ Rb6 39. Bc4+ Kd7 40. Rxa7+ Kc8 41. Rc7+ {And black resigned in light of being hopelessly lost.  41... Kb8 walks into a wind mill and 41... Kd8 42.Rd1  Qd2 (42... Ke8 43.Bxf7  Kf8 44.Re8#) is simply lost, he's down two bishop after his queen is taken (sadly, white doesn't have 43.Rh1 because of 43... Rxf6  44.Bxf6 Kxc7).  Kamsky pulled off this win by giving up his queen for two pieces in order to place a dominating pawn on b7 with two very long scoped bishops supporting it that together dominated the board, not only that but he opened the a and b files to great effect, in the botvinnik black has very loose pawns one of white's goals is to open up files, 16.Rb1 goes for that but 16.Na4 followed by a3 is another completely viable and very dangerous plan.  I think the most remarkable thing about this game is that black got no counterplay (except his slight prayer for a perpetual at the end) in one of the most dicey and counterattacking openings, white's queen sacrifice tied Kramnik down completely.  Kudos to Kamsky.  if you have any comments or variations, I'd love to hear it.  I'm never sure how many variations to stick in, and when to stick to descriptions.}
