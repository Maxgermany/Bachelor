[Opening "QGD Slav (D15), 4.Nc3"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 {We begin with a Slav Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined.  I'm no expert on this line, but from what I've seen of it I wish I knew a lot more about it.  One of the more combative lines at Black's disposal.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 {A fairly conservative line, I'm inclined to think, though no less playable for all that.  I used to like Bg5 in this type of position.} Be7 6. Bd3 {An aggressive posting for the bishop.  Black could play 6...dxc4, here, inducing White to 'lose' a tempo by 7.Bxc4.  However, as that tends to change the nature of the game, Black figures that that might not be the best way to go.  A judgment call.} O-O 7. O-O h6 {Here we drop out of the Gameknot World Database.  Much more usual is 7...Nbd7.  One feels that this preventative move doesn't really prevent anything much.} 8. e4 {(!) Good response: a strike at the centre.} dxe4 {Also possible was 8...dxc4.  Nothing much in it really.} 9. Nxe4 Nxe4 10. Bxe4 {Right now, one feels that White should have something good going on the K-side - look at those bishops!  But, constrained though Black's position is, his resources are sufficient.  White doesn't get much traction on the K-side in the ensuing moves.} Nd7 11. d5 {(?!)  This looks rather premature, to me.  Clearing away the centre as it does, one is left with rather an arid looking game, with neither side able to establish an ascendancy.  Well, appearances can fool you, as you will find out!  Better might have been to develop the dark-square bishop to e3 or f4.} cxd5 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Qxd5 {(!?) I think I might have been inclined to take with the bishop in similar circumstances.  One suspects White might have been expressing an interest in Q-exchanges here: 13...Nf6  14.Qxd8.} Nf6 14. Qe5 {But no!  He is not in least desirous of exchanging Queens!  } Nxe4 15. Qxe4 Re8 {At this point the consequences of White's 11th move become apparent.  His lead in development has largely been pulled in, the centre is a vacuum, and Black has the bishop pair in an open position.   Given the symmetry of the pawn structures, I'd say the game was too close to call, here.} 16. Qc2 {Cautiously removing the Q from the e-file.  But 16.Re1 would have maintained the Q's active posting for the nonce, or 16.Bf4 would have been a useful development, the Queen able to run away if attacked by, say, 16...Bf6.} Be6 17. Be3 Rc8 18. Qa4 {A threat - the first sign that the pace might be picking up...} a6 19. Rfd1 {One of the most difficult decisions one often has to make on the chessboard is 'which rook'?  Capablanca lost his first match game with Alekhine through making the wrong such decision.  Here White figures that the the rooks will have more scope if the King's Rook moves first to attack the enemy Queen.  } Qc7 20. Nd4 {(?!) Possibly the other rook could have come in at c1 at this point.  } Bf6 {(!?) Instead, 20...Bg4! would have livened up proceedings: 21.f3 Bd6 with the idea 22.fxg4 Bxh2ch  23.Kh1 Rxe3.  If White tries 21.Rdc1, then comes 21...Qe5  22.h3 (say) Bd6!  23.hxg4 Qh2ch  24.Kf1 Rxc1ch  25.Rxc1 Qh1ch  26.Ke2 Rxe3ch  27.fxe3 Qxc1.  } 21. Rac1 {Logical enough: gets the rook into action with a gain of time.  But there was something to be said for 21.Nxe6 as well: 21...Rxe6  22.Rc1 Qb8 23.Rxc8 Qxc8  24.Rc1 and then 25.b3 with a level game.} Qd7 {'Might I interest you in a friendly exchange of Queens?' } 22. Qb4 {'Mmmm... no thanks!'  But White might have been well advised to have accepted it.} Rxc1 {(!)} 23. Rxc1 Rd8 {(?!)  Better was to grab the a2-pawn (23...Bxa2) whilst the grabbing was good.} 24. Rd1 {(?) 24.Nxe6 was indicated, if only to save the a-pawn.  To very the good question  'What about 24.Nxe6 Qd1ch  25.Rxd1 Rxd1 and mates?',  White has this answer: 25.Qe1! Qxe1ch  26.Rxe1 fxe6  27.b3.   The slightly better pawn structure would then give White a marginal edge.} Bxd4 {Again, ...Bxa2 was indicated.} 25. Bxd4 {If White were interested in forcing off the major pieces, he could have played 25.Rxd4.  Not so good would have been 25.Qxd4 as after all the heavy pieces come off, White drops his a-pawn.  Mind you, that would leave Black with a tough job extracting the win, with the bishops 'of opposite colours' - i.e. the respective bishops operating on opposite colour squares.} Qc6 26. a3 Qc2 27. Qe1 Bb3 {Turnus at the ships!  Black throws in an attack and forces White onto the defensive.  But there just isn't the weight to make it good.} 28. Rd2 {Also likely was 28.Rc1, but this move is fine.   In the next few moves Aeneas (White) steps out of his entrenchments and forces the annexation of a sizeable chunk of the centre.  With just three pieces remaining, many commentators would call this an endgame.  No: this is too 'middle-game-ish' to be called an endgame just yet.} Qf5 29. h3 {(?) If White thought weakening the K-side pawns was necessary, maybe 29.f3 would have been the better choice, to restrict the enemy bishop, and to give his own bishop more scope.  White does indeed play f3 shortly after this, which further calls this move into question.} Ba4 {At first sight, ...Bd5 suggests itself, but Black obviously wants the bishop firmly anchored at c6.} 30. Qc1 Bc6 31. Qc3 {White is not standing still to be hit: he takes a smack of his own at the g7-square.  The battle is starting to get interesting, g2, and g7 being the primary targets of Black and White respectively.} Qg6 {Defends g7 and attacks g2 - combining attack and defence.} 32. f3 {Cuts the Black bishop off from the attack.  See how White has also combined attack and defence.  From c3 the Queen supports the bishop's strike at g7, at the same time prevents the enemy bishop taking the pawn at f3.} Qe6 {Trying a different tack.} 33. Rd3 {I like this move.  Defensively motivated (to protect e1) there is an aggressive point to the move as well.} Bb5 {Drives the Rook where White wants it to go.  But had Black anything better at this point?} 34. Re3 Qc4 {Another Queen exchange offered by Black.  White doesn't want to know.  An alternative method of offering an exchange would have been 34...Rc8.  If White had chosen to accept (35.Rxe6 Rxc3  36.Bxc3 fxe6) the bishop ending would most likely have been drawn.} 35. Re4 {(?) At last White makes a serious mistake that might well have cost him the game.  The Rook protects the bishop, and the threat is 36.Bxg7,  but Black has a strong response to this.  Instead, White could simply have snatched the g7-pawn and made off with the booty: 35.Bxg7!} Qf1+ {Probably Black had this in mind all along if White refused to exchange.  But with 35...f5! Black would have won material (36.Rh4 g5!  37.Rxh6 Qxd4).} 36. Kh2 Bc6 {(?) Black would have maintained a level pegging by playing 37...Qd3 or ...Qc4, offereing Queen exchanges again.  Now White gains the upper hand.} 37. Re1 {(?!) In this way White gains an edge.  But he had two better winning alternatives.  One is a quite a bit better; the other much, much better!  The 'Quite a bit better' line runs 37.Bxg7!? Bxe4!?  (A rook sac withal!  But it gets better!)  38.Bxh6 ... and Black will have to shed cartloads of material to avert checkmate;  or  37...Qd3! 38.Rg4 Qxc3  39.Bxc3ch Kf8  40.Bxg7ch and picks up a second pawn to improve his chances in the opposite-bishop ending.  What about the 'Much, much better' line then?  At once 37.Rg4! and Black is busted:  37.Rg4 g6  38.Bh8 Kf8  39.Qc5ch Ke8  [39...Kg8 40.Qe5 Kf8   41.Bg7ch Kg8  42.Bxh6 with a forced mate]  40.Bf6 Rd7   41.Qe5ch Kf8  42.Qb8ch etc.} Qb5 {(plus/equals)} 38. Bxg7 {Wins a pawn, and gains the initiative as well.  Third best as it was, 37.Re1  was still good enough for an edge.} Qg5 39. Bf6 {A fork!  But Black at least can get out of this one.} Qf4+ 40. Kg1 {I prefer Kh1 as safer, but wanting to bring the King closer to the centre, and keep it off the enemy bishop's diagonal withal, is understandable.} Rc8 {(?)  The reason why I've marked this as a mistake will appear next turn...} 41. Bh8 {(!?) White once again comes up with a strong move that turns out to be not the strongest.  Lethal would have been 41.Re4!! This one's not really a rook sacrifice, but it's a spectacular move all he same.  After 41.Re4!! Bxe4  42.Qxc8ch Kh7  43.Qh8ch Kg6  44.Qg7ch  Kf5  45.fxe4ch and however he plays it, Black is forced into a hopeless endgame.} Qg5 42. Bf6 Qg3 43. Re7 {(?!) Again, 43.Re4 was the way to go.  This is a reprise of the situation at move 41.  Suppose, instead of ...Bxe4, Black tried 43...Qd6?  then comes  44.Rg4ch Kf8  45.Bh4!! ... (Very hard move to find, this, but it threatens mate and other ghastlinesses, such as 45...Ke8  46.Re4ch Bxe4  47.Qxc8ch etc)  45...f6  46.Rg6 winning.  After this move, White finds himself having to redeploy the rook.} Rd8 44. Re1 {(?) Actually, White could have made good use of the rook on the 7th by 44.Qb3!, again combining attack and defence.  But this retreat turns out rather well.} Rc8 {(?) As you were.  The discovered attack upon the rook induces its move off the d8-square.  But it was here that Black had a hidden resource that might well have saved the situation.  Yes, it is a sacrifice: 44...Bxf3!! Surprisingly, White has no way of averting mate without loss of material.  His best reply is to counter-sacrifice: 45.Qxf3! Qxe1ch  46.Kh2 Rd6  47.Qg4ch Kf8  48.Bc3 ... followed by 49.Bb4 recovers the exchange.   Possibly White has the edge in the pawn ending after 48.Bc3 Qe6  49.Bb4 Ke7  50.Qxe6ch!? Kxe6  51.Bxd6 Kxd6  52.Kg3 - I haven't tested that... } 45. Rd1 {As before, 45.Re4 was the winning move.} Bd7 {(??) But this was the losing move - or could have been.  Here is the Queen sacrifice:  46.Qxc8ch!! Bxc8  47.Rd8ch Kh7  48.Rh8ch Kg6   49.Rg8ch Kxf6  50.Rxg3.  With Rook and extra pawn for the bishop, White would have taken out the ending with few difficulties.} 46. Qe5 {(?) Not as spectacular, but this move, for good or ill, forces the Queen exchange, on account of the double attack, on Queen and bishop..} Qxe5 47. Bxe5 Be6 {Sensible: anchors the bishop.  In the endgame that ensues, Black is thrown onto the defensive: a pawn down, and no real prospects for counter-attack.} 48. Rd4 Rc1+ 49. Kh2 {49.Kf2 was safe enough...} Re1 50. Rd8+ Kh7 51. Bc3 {Retiring to a safe anchorage also.  Both sides are playing this ending with circumspection.  However, it will be a difficult one for White to win.  His chances are really localised to the K-side, which limits his options, rather.  Instead of the text, he might have tried 51.Rh8ch Kg6  52.Bf4 (attacking the h-pawn)  52...Rb1  53.Rxh6ch Kf5  54.Be3 Rxb2? and now 55.Bd4! Ra2  56.Rf6ch Kg5  57.h4ch Kxh4  58.Be3 ... (weaving a mating net; Black has but one way to escape) 58...Bg4!  59.Rxf7! Bh5  60.Rf5 Bg6  61.Re5 Rc2  62.Bf4! ... All this intricate manoeuvring leads to a forced mate - a really fine finish.  Black doesn't have to play 54...Rxb2, but then he gets left with two pawns' deficit.  Holding the game really does become problematic in that event.} Re2 52. Re8 Kg6 53. Rg8+ Kf5 54. Kg3 {White cannot allow Black too easy ingress into his position, as then Black would have serious prospects of counter-play, enough, maybe, to turn the tables completely.} Bd5 55. Rh8 {Instead, White could have carried on as he was doing and gone after the h-pawn with his King.  The rook standing at g8 would have performed two useful functions: protecting the g-pawn, and cutting the Black King off from access to the g- and h-files.  So: 55.Kh4 was called for:  55...Kf4  56.Rg4ch Kf5  57.Rd5 Bc6  58.g4ch and White is making progress.} Kg6 56. Rd8 Bc6 57. Rd6+ Kh7 {Probably Black should have intervened with rook, here (57...Re6)} 58. Bd2 Re6 {Forced, else the h-pawn fell.} 59. Rxe6 {Understandably, White exchanges down into a simpler ending (simpler in this context means just fewer units on the board), seeing no way to progress with the rooks on.  I'd probably keep probing with them on for a bit longer, as White's winning prospects in the pure Bishop and Pawn ending don't look too flash.  The pure pawn ending might be a different story, but how do you arrange (let alone force) the exchange of bishops when they are invulnerable to each other?} fxe6 60. Kf4 Kg6 61. Kg4 {Seizing the Opposition.  However, there might have been better prospects with 61.g4 (...e5ch; 62.Kg3! h5  63.Bc3 hxg4  64.fxg4 e4  65.Kf4, say).} h5+ 62. Kh4 {This looks counter-intuitive at first sight.  But now Black will find that maintaining this pawn will not be easy.  For the King to move, Black will have to bring his bishop to e8.  Having said that, though, it doesn't look as though White's King has much of a future either.} Bd5 63. b4 Bc6 {Marking time. The onus is upon White to show he can win this ending.} 64. Kg3 {Recasting his plans.} Kf5 65. Kf2 Bd5 66. g4+ hxg4 67. fxg4+ {At the cost of allowing Black a passed pawn, White creates co-joined passers of his own.} Kg6 68. g5 {(!?) This move I don't like.  True, passed pawns should be pushed, but in general,  co-joined passers should present a united front.  The right move, then, was probably 68.h4.  Even then, supposing the position was reached with no change but the h-pawn on h4, I'd play h5(ch) keeping the dark squares open for the King and the bishop to operate on.  From here, getting the pawns forward will be more difficult.  Having said all that, it turns out that White is doing better than I thought...} Kh5 {Good: making use of the light squares left unguarded.} 69. Kg3 Be4 70. h4 Bf5 {Black's defences on the K-side look pretty solid, eh?} 71. Be1 {(!) I can't see any other way of making progress either.  But as it turns out, this seems to be enough to offer White very good chances after all.  } Be4 {And there you have it.  Black was in something of a 'zugzwang' and had to make this small concession: a couple of tempi for White...} 72. Kf4 Bf5 73. Ke5 {Having teleported himself to e5 with zero expenditure of energy (Black's position remaining unchanged), white imposes upon Black once more.  Probably Black should play 73...Kg6 here though White can then choose from 74.Kd6 Kf7  75.Kc7 Be4  76.h5; or maybe 74.Bd2 threatening h5ch Kxh5; Kf6.} Bg4 74. Kf6 {1-0.  Black gave it up at this point.  I thought at first he should have played on: White still had the job to do.  Now I am less inclined to be critical.  For instance, after 74...Bf5, White does not at once play 75.g6?, but a waiting move: 75.Bf2.  Then, White continues to play waiting moves until Black relaxes his guard over e6 or g6, so: 74...Bf5  75.Bf2 b5  76.Be1 Bg4  77.g6 Kh6  78.Bd2ch Kh5  79.g7 wins. My earlier suggested 'improvements' notwithstanding, this is a well played example of a difficult type of ending. }
