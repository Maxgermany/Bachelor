1. e4 {First off, thank you for watching my game.   this is the third game i will be posting with this gambit. the 2 previous ones had very uncommon replies on move 3. This third game had a more classical development and i wanted to show a possible result and also save this game >< i hope you enjoy.} Nc6 {if you've seen my other annotated games, it comes to no surprise i like to play the nimzowitsch and is a reason i like annotating these games because i rarely see them played,} 2. Nf3 f5 {and of course my favorite but very dangerous f5 for the whites who know the lines.} 3. exf5 {gambit accepted. i think this is the first one i post where the gambit is accepted,  its meant to undermine whites middle and take it for yourself. the proper reply is d5 to take middle and recapture the pawn with your WSB} d5 4. Bb5 {this is one of the most common and aggressive replies by white,} Bxf5 {followed by recapturing the pawn,   some whites will double pawn you here immediately if they dont know the lines well and to avoid further black shannanigans, a double pawn situation is acceptable and very playable for the black as this opening makes for a strong king side attack and apart from getting double pawned it might be the only time you play on the queen side of the board.} 5. d3 {it is wiser for white to go d4 immediately over d3, this will help me gain time and be prepared for his counter assault.} e6 {e6 is the proper reply. if white takes out the DSB. you block with your DSB. if he promotes his knight to e5 you defend with your queen on d6.} 6. Ne5 Qd6 {my oponent decided to play the knight now. you see the importance of d4 over d3 last move it will gain me time to reinforce my other knight and have no possible double bishop pins} 7. d4 {a move too late my friend ><} Nge7 {now all is left is to kick the bishop away or force the entire exchange as i like to do} 8. O-O {it was either castle, playing his knight or his DSB, but he is now a move behind all because of his d3} a6 {kick} 9. Bxc6+ {my oponent decides to not retreat and open up the game its desired} Nxc6 {here he probably knows that on my following move i will trade off knights and try to gain a pawn with my queen and he decides to swap out knights instead of reinforcing the position i think this was a mistake.} 10. Nxc6 Qxc6 {now if we look at the board on move 10. he has 3 passive pieces top right side. with 1 middle pawn gone. black has center control and is 2 moves from full development and onwards king side attack, the bearing down on the c3 pawn is also supposed to force my oponent into defending it thus giving me more time. my play simple develop bishop to d3, king side castle having the open file from my f5 move,} 11. Nc3 {his most anticipated reply but i love this because it solidifies whites thinking that the c2 pawn is safe.  white players is c3 a better move?} Bd6 {take my favorite diagonal for my DSB} 12. Qh5+ {he decided to pull a queen check now it is too late he had to do it way earlier when he still had his other knight. he missed his left side opurtunity for counter tricks,   to defend this it is very important not to use your pawns keep em aligned as long as possible having lost the F file pawn} Bg6 {here if the queen doesnt retreat to e2 or d1 i will take that c3 pawn i was eyeing earlier and that false sense of security he got with his knight,} 13. Qd1 {aw he retreated appropriately} O-O {time to castle development complete.  on move look at blacks deployment over whites, i love this opening gambits vs the unprepared ><} 14. Ne2 {oops at this stage i dont know what his plan was but he just gave me the pawn i was after} Bxc2 {there we go} 15. Qd2 {hes forced to play his queen} a5 {this i think for me was a mistake but i didnt want his queen going right side at any stage during this game. and i was looking for possible ways to attack with my bishop on his queen but those were all plans made on the spot due to my opponents reactions and i should be focusing on the checkmate left side instead  although as i said earlier queen side play isnt  necessary during this game and can throw you off course. } 16. Nc3 {he sees the threat coming decides to block it and forces my retreat. which i liked cause it came back to me during the game i dont need to play queen side.} Bg6 {return to the previous state of game minus a pawn for him} 17. Qe3 {when he replied this i saw the weakness in my pawn i didnt want to focus a battle there so i decided to gain time on the queen this was a mistake} Bf4 {as soon as i played this move i was like damn what did i do i just missed my favorite trap,  the proper play here is Rook to f7 and letting him eat the pawn with queen as in:  and then Qxe6 Bxh2+, Kxh2   Qxe6!!!} 18. Qe2 {i was so happy he stayed in that file but i had to give him the opurtunity to take the pawn before he backed his queen with his rook. he didnt see the trap yet} Bd6 {so i give him the pawn } 19. Qxe6+ {he takes it.  why it was so important to do Rf7 earlier! now i still have to block with the rook but pray he doesnt move the queen or reinforce with his rook.} Rf7 20. Qg4 {aw!!!! } Raf8 {ill double stack and get ready to dig out the king anyway see what happens} 21. Be3 {hmmmm blocking off the file cutting out the right side of the board (where i dont want to go anymore)  whats this!!! my trap is still alive!} h5 {BLUnDER!  or is it :D} 22. Qxg6 Bxh2+ {Dun Dun Dun! it cost me an extra bishop cause of my earlier attack/mistake with my black bishop but i still got my favorite trap! btw those are the bishop sacrifices i mentioned in title (i think :D)} 23. Kxh2 Qxg6 {it feels so good *devilish laugh* double stacked rooks with the queen vs an almost exposed king and a cut off board by white. i think his position fell into disrepair} 24. Nxd5 Qg4 {i decided to move my queen first because i inivited the rook to go to the C file} 25. Rac1 {and he did} c6 {all i wanted was for his knight not to come to f4} 26. Nc3 {and it didnt!  time to scramble for a checkmate, it looks so close yet it can be very far id appreciate anyone telling me if i took a detour lol} h4 {here im trying to cramp the king more but its important not to go to high with the pawn in this situation or everything can backfire} 27. Rc2 {hmm my fight isnt on f2 although he thinks it is. although the way my pieces were aligned i wouldved judged the battle was headed to f1 after my pawn move, i wonder if him moving his rook there is weakening.  for what i had planned it was perfect i considered it a wasted move} Rf7f3 {if he takes the rook with the pawn he cannot stop the checkmate. all whites replies from here on would be appreciated.  but a "free" rook looks too juicy, this being the rook "sacrifice" (i think :D)  with this move is also why i thought the fight was going to end on f1 and why his rook to c2 delighted me} 28. gxf3 Rxf3 {and mission complete he has 0 replies possible to prevent Rh3# my oponent resigned.  i hope you all enjoyed the lines and the tricks i had in this game. All comments appreciated!}
