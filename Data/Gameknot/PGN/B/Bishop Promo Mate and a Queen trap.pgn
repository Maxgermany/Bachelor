1. e4 e6 2. f4 {I decide to play tactical.} d5 3. d4 {Baiting him. This move is not found in GK's database.} dxe4 {In truth, this was a risky gambit. The passed pawn has the potential to cause much grief later on.} 4. Nd2 {Better than Nc3, which can be pinned. I plan on pulling the pawn closer to the jaws of death.} Nf6 5. g4 {Gonna chase his Knight.} e3 {I had planned on playing Ne4 here, but that is impossible now.} 6. Nc4 {Twice attacking the pawn.} Nd5 {If I would have been thinking, I would have traded for the pawn.} 7. Bg2 Nxf4 8. Bf3 Qh4+ {I thought I was in trouble, but after closer inspection, I found there wasn't too much to fear.} 9. Kf1 e2+ {Fail. He throws his attack out of the window.} 10. Bxe2 Nxe2 {There goes his forward troops.} 11. Qxe2 Be7 12. h3 {I immediately think of trapping the Queen.} O-O 13. Nf3 Qf6 14. Bg5 {The Queen is as good as dead, now, since there is only one open square. Maybe Qxf3+ then taking the Bishop would have been good.} Qg6 15. Nce5 Qxg5 16. Nxg5 Bxg5 {But the same outcome is reached.} 17. h4 Be7 18. g5 f6 {Discovered checks are nasty, but this one is quite benign.} 19. gxf6 Bxf6 20. Ke1 Nc6 21. c3 Ne7 22. h5 Nf5 23. Rg1 {Pinning the pawn.} Bh4+ 24. Kd2 c6 25. Rg4 Bf6 26. Rag1 {Doubling on the g-file.} Nh6 {Now for a pretty lil sacrifice.} 27. Rg4xg7+ Bxg7 28. Qg2 Nf5 29. h6 Rf6 30. hxg7 Nh4 31. Qg5 {I'm trying, once more, to bait him. This time a royal fork is the bait.} Nf3+ {He bites!} 32. Nxf3 {Taking with the Rook is not a good option.} Rxf3 33. Qd8+ Kf7 34. g8=B# {And I promote to a Bishop to mate! Gotta love under promotions! I hope you enjoyed it! Please rate and comment!}
