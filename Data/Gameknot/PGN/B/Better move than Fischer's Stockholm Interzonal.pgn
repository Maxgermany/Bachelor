1. e4 {I found this game cool game by Bobby Fischer vs. Bolbochan, but I found an interesting move, which was not actually played, but I think it would've been a better move, unless I'm missing something. What do you guys think? Replay the game and stop by move 25, to read my suggestion. Thanks and enjoy! Additional comentaries are from other sources, except on move 25.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. h3 Nc6 7. g4 Nxd4 8. Qxd4 e5 9. Qd3 Be7 {More accurate is 9...B-K3 immediately.--Fischer } 10. g5 Nd7 11. Be3 Nc5 12. Qd2 Be6 13. O-O-O O-O 14. f3 Rc8 15. Kb1 {Amateurs are often puzzled by this apparent loss of time. Actually it is a handy defensive move, getting out of the pin on the QB-file which could become annoying after ...P-QN4-5. One never knows when lightning will strike! -- Fischer } Nd7 16. h4 b5 17. Bh3 Bxh3 18. Rxh3 Nb6 19. Bxb6 Qxb6 20. Nd5 {White has a strategically won game; his Knight cannot be dislodged. -- Fischer } Qd8 21. f4 exf4 22. Qxf4 Qd7 23. Qf5 Rcd8 24. Ra3 Qa7 25. Rc3 {Here's my find: Instead of this Rc3, why not Nf6  ?  Black is forced to take the knight to avoid mate by Qxh7#. He can either take with the pawn, which leads to a quick win for white, or he can take with be bishop, which leaves white with good advantage. Here are the options: 25.Nf6  gxf6 26.gxf6 Kh8 27.Qg5 Rg8 28.fxe7 and white is winning. Or 25.Nf6  Bxf6 26.gxf6 g6 (not gxf6?) 27.Qg5 which, I think, wins quicker than what Fischer played. What do you guys think??  } g6 26. Qg4 Qd7 27. Qf3 Qe6 28. Rc7 Rde8 29. Nf4 Qe5 30. Rd5 Qh8 31. a3 h6 32. gxh6 Qxh6 33. h5 Bg5 34. hxg6 fxg6 35. Qb3 {The coup de grace.--Fischer } Rxf4 36.
