1. e4 {I was honored to be able to play someone ranked in the 1800's.} d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {Moving his knight instead of capturing my pawn with his queen surprised me.} 3. Bc4 c6 4. d6 exd6 5. d4 {I started to figure this would be a battle of tempo.} d5 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. Nf3 O-O 8. O-O Bg4 9. Be3 Qc7 10. g3 {Pretty much forced.} Nbd7 11. c4 dxc4 12. Bxc4 Nb6 13. Nbd2 {I really liked this move! My knight just seemed so valuable in this spot.} h5 14. Qb3 Nxc4 {This move surprised both fianchetto52 and myself.  Knowing fianchetto52 personally and losing two games to him, I view him as highly skilled and who plays well above the 1200 rank attributed to him.} 15. Qxc4 Rae8 16. Ng5 {After unpinning my queen I really wanted to place my knight here.  This proved to be a very valuable outpost!  } h4 17. h3 hxg3 {I was shocked that jammic would trade this much material for this move.  After looking it over carefully, I decided that the bishop had to be terminated.} 18. hxg4 Nxg4 {Now it's starting to heat up!} 19. Qd3 g6 {Forced} 20. Nde4 Kg7 {I think jammic's idea is good, but he doesn't have enough of a time advantage to make this work in the end.} 21. d5 gxf2+ 22. Bxf2 Bh2+ 23. Kg2 Nxf2 24. Rxf2 cxd5 25. Qh3 Rfh8 26. Qc3+ Qxc3 {This saves my knight!} 27. Nxc3 Be5 28. Rxf7+ Kg8 29. Rh1 {Fianchetto52 mentioned this move and the more I meditated on it the more it seemed like the best option.  Essentially, I'm trading an inactive rook for jammic's most valuable piece.  Apparently this seals the deal!} Rxh1 30. Kxh1 {After dueling for about 2 months, this is where jammic resigns and congratulates me on a good game. I'm thankful that he gave me the opportunity as many high ranked players will not play chess against lower ranked players. }
