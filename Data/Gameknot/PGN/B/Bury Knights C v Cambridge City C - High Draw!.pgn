1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bg2 Nxc3 6. bxc3 {6. bxc3 - an early plethora of exchanges follow an English Opening.  This will lead to open play.} c6 7. d4 exd4 8. Qxd4 Qxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Bd2 Bxd2+ 11. Kxd2 {11. Kxd2 - a further set of exchanges and it is almost an endgame before the opening is over!} Be6 12. e4 Na6 {12. .......... Na6 - out comes the wood!} 13. Ne2 Ke7 14. Rhd1 Rhd8 {14. ....... Rhd8 - both kings are centralised with the queens off and now the king rooks face each other on the d file.} 15. a3 Nc7 16. Ke3 f6 {16. ........ f6 - black tries to improve the position of her pieces and pawns.  I need to further centralise my king but Henry does not get much beyond his second rank.} 17. Nc3 Rab8 18. Rab1 Bf7 {18. ......... Bf7, to make way for Henry to come to e6 but white decides to expand on the kingside.} 19. g4 h5 20. h3 hxg4 21. hxg4 b5 22. d5 cxd5 23. exd5 {23. exd5 - both of us have tried to expand on the kingside and queenside respectively but this has just resulted in an exchange of pawns.  However, white now has a passed d pawn.} Bg6 24. Rb4 a6 {24. ....... a6 - to bolster the b5 pawn just in case white chooses to double rooks on the b file.} 25. f4 f5 26. Bf3 fxg4 27. Bxg4 Ne8 {27. ......... Ne8 - to try and prevent the d pawn coming to d6.} 28. f5 Bf7 29. Rbd4 Nd6 {29. .......... Nd6 - d pawn is successfully blockaded.} 30. Kf4 Rde8 31. Kg5 Rb7 32. Ne4 Nxe4+ 33. Rxe4+ {33. Rxe4  - white forces an exchange of knights freeing up the d pawn.} Kd8 34. Red4 Re3 35. Rd1d3 Rxd3 36. Rxd3 {36. Rxd3 - now one pair of rooks have been exchanged easing the pressure on the d file.} a5 {36. ............. a5 - I try to get a passer of my own on the queenside.} 37. f6 gxf6+ 38. Kxf6 b4 39. Bd1 {39. Bd1 - played to halt the advance of my b pawn.} Be8 40. axb4 axb4 41. Bb3 {41. Bb3 - blockades the b pawn.} Rf7+ 42. Ke6 Rb7 43. Kd6 Bd7 44. Kc5 Be8 45. Rd4 Bd7 46. Rxb4 Rxb4 47. Kxb4 {47. Kxb4 - after a lot of manoeuvering about there is no saving my b pawn and white still has his passer - but, unfortunately for him my king is blockading the pawn on a different colour square to the white lsb.  Although there are same colour bishops I feel this game is heading for a draw.  Here I offer him a draw but he declined.  However .......} Be8 48. Kc5 Bd7 49. d6 Bf5 50. Kd4 Bd7 51. Ke5 Bc6 {51. ........... Bc6 - Ian finally comes round to my way of thinking and he offers me a draw which I gladly accept.  I will now tell you a little story about this game.  It is another OTB trip down memory lane. In 1997 I was the captain of the Cambridge City C Team, although with my low rating I played on either boards 4 of 4 or 3 of 4.  All I asked of my team was that they just do their best and make sure they show up!  That evening, a team-mate Romalt, our top board player was taken ill and so could not play.  That meant I had to play on board 2 against a player rated much higher than myself.  Somehow, though, I did not mind being the under-dog.  One of my other team-mates got a draw and our team came away with 1 point out of 4 which at first sounds pretty poor but allowing for the fact that we each had to play one board higher than normal and we were one player short I think we acquitted ourselves reasonably well.  At the time Ian Webster was the highest rated player I had drawn against in a rated game so I was really chuffed at the time.  I did surpass this effort a few months later in the Roger Goldsmith Trophy by drawing against a player with a rating of 1560 - and he ended up being on the defending side!}
