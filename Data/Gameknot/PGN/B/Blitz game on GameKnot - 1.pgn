1. d4 d5 2. c4 {after 1. d4 d5 I chose Queen's gambit to play.} e6 {Black defends his pawn. I see this option almost every time I play Queen's gambit.} 3. Nc3 {So, I continued with Nc3, intending Bf4 and Nb5 later on, which I have never tried to play.} Be7 {Black continues by developing his Bishop on e7.} 4. Bf4 {I played as I wanted, but later on someting changed...} Nf6 {Black puts his knight on f6, which allowed me to play 5. Nb5, but...} 5. e3 {I thought it would be better if first I give some places to my bishop to go and also to defend my c4 pawn.} a6 {With this Black avoided my next intended, Nb5 move.} 6. Nf3 {I had nothing to do, but to develop my other minor pieces and to keep on planning.} b6 {I think this was the first wrong move from Black. Guess if what was my next move!} 7. Ne5 {Of course I centralized my knight! He would have some options. 1:Try to chase my knight away with some moves which takes too long. (for example: Nfd7, and after f6 or Bf6) 2:Try to exchange knights, with the same Nfd7 move But two things were sure. 1:He has no Nc6 move 2: ...} Nbd7 {He has no Nbd7 move, because of:} 8. Nc6 {His Queen is trapped. Resignation from Black followed. I hope you enjoyed this annotation, feel free to comment! Thank you for your the attention!}
