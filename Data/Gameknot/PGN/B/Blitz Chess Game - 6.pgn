[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Graz variation"]

1. e4 {Popular opening.} e5 {No French today. Instead I play a more aggressive move.} 2. Nf3 {White's trying to get on the front foot early.} Nc6 {Black defends with the knight.} 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez opening. White's trying to take away the defender of the e5 pawn so it can capture.} a6 {Another good move would be d6 defending the e5 pawn. I'm risking doubled pawns but White might lose his valuable bishop pair.} 4. Ba4 {The bishop retreats.} b5 {I try to open up my queenside and get on the front foot.} 5. Bb3 {Only option if he wanted to retain the bishop.} Nf6 {I continue to develop.} 6. d3 {He defends his pawn.} Bc5 {I continue to develop my pieces. In doing so I have taken centre control.} 7. O-O {He castles kingside.} d6 {Opening up the diagonal for my bishop.} 8. Ng5 {He advances his knight trying to play a variation of the fried liver on me.} O-O {I castle.} 9. Bxf7+ {Interesting move. In doing so he's sacrificing his only two developed pieces.} Rxf7 {Obvious move.} 10. Nxf7 {He takes my rook.} Kxf7 {My king looks out of place but that's a small price to pay for a huge positional advantage.} 11. Bg5 {Pinning the knight.} h6 {Forcing the bishop to decide whether to take or retreat.} 12. Bxf6 {He takes.} Qxf6 {I bring my queen into the game.} 13. Qf3 {Personally I thought that Qh5 would have been better. Now if I take he has doubled pawns.} Qxf3 {We swap off our queens.} 14. gxf3 {He takes back doubling his pawns.} Bh3 {I get aggressive with my bishops.} 15. Re1 {Rook moves away. A bad spot to put it because now I win a  pawn. Possibly a rook if he doesn't act fast.} Nd4 {I advance my knight.} 16. Kh1 {The king moves avoiding the fork. Well one of them.} Nxc2 {I fork the rooks.} 17. Rg1 {The beginning of the end.} Nxa1 {Obvious move.} 18. Nc3 {He plays a discovered attack on my knight.} Bxf2 {I gain a crucial pawn but lose my knight.} 19. Rxa1 {He gets my knight.} b4 {I wanted him to think he could attack a bit. But overall it was a nothing move.} 20. Nd5 {He advances his knight} Rg8 {I bring my rook into the action.} 21. Nxc7 {He takes a pawn. Oblivious to what's happenening.} g5 {I advance my pawn hoping to swap it off later. Or maybe even better.} 22. Nxa6 {He still has no idea what's going on.} g4 {I offer the swap.} 23. Nxb4 {He declines and takes another pawn.} gxf3 {I get a free pawn and open up the g file for my rook.Checkmate is impossible to avoid now.} 24. a4 {He still doesn't know what's going on. Either that or he realises that his cause is impossible.} Bg2# {And gameover. Hope you enjoyed the game.}
