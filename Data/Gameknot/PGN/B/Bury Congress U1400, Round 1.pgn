1. e4 {Hi everyone, I would like to tell you about my best ever Chess Congress.  I played in the U1400 section in the Bury St Edmunds Congress, England.  There were 5 rounds and these lasted two days.  As it was well within driving distance I did not have an overnight stay in Bury.  This is the first of the five games.  Hope you enjoy.  Joanne} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {5. ............... g6 - the start of the Sicilian Dragon.} 6. Bd3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. O-O Nc6 9. Nxc6 bxc6 {9. .................... bxc6 - I often used to exchange knights here - this has brought me mixed results as you will see in my other two games in this congress with the Sicilian.} 10. Kh1 {10. Kh1 - Henry sidestepps any queen checks on b6 should Frere Lenoir move off the g1 - a7 diagonal.} Ng4 11. Bd2 Bd4 {11. .................... Bd4 - ganging up on the f2 pawn, eh?  Nasty, nasty.} 12. Qe1 {12. Qe1 - enter, Glenda the Defender!  Now what's in her in-tray today?  Defend f2 pawn!} Qb6 {12. ............ Qb6 - sssss!  The Wicked Witch of the West appears on b6 and she is piling up on the f pawn and attacking my b2 pawn.  My next move Nd1 appears to defend both.} 13. Nd1 Be6 14. c3 Be5 15. f4 {15. f4 - screens off the enemy dsb's line to h2 and it retreats to g7.} Bg7 16. Be3 Nxe3 17. Qxe3 Qc7 {17. ............. Qc7 - refusing to trade queens - black still thinks he has an attack.} 18. Rf2 f5 19. exf5 Bxf5 20. Bxf5 Rxf5 {20. ............... Rxf5 - a plethora of exchanges have taken place on f5 relieving the pressure on my position.} 21. Qc1 Bh6 22. g3 d5 23. Ne3 {23. Ne3 - activating my knight and attacking the black rook on f5.} Rh5 24. Ng4 Bg7 {24. .............. Bg7 - wants to preserve his dsb.} 25. Kg1 Rf8 26. Qc2 c5 27. Rd1 d4 28. cxd4 c4 {28. .................. c4 - the pawn on d4 cannot be taken because the c pawn is pinned to the Wicked Witch on c7.} 29. Ne3 Rc8 30. Rfd2 Qb6 31. Nxc4 {31. Nxc4 - the black c pawn drops.} Qe6 32. b3 Rd5 33. Qb1 {33. Qb1 - Glenda releases my knight from the pin by the black rook on c8.} Rcd8 34. Ne5 Qb6 35. Qa1 Rxe5 36. fxe5 Bxe5 37. Kf1 {37. Kf1 - after an interesting exchange sacrifice Henry moves out of the pin so I am now threatening to take on e5.} Bf6 38. Ke1 {38. Ke1 - after black's dsb retreats to f6 Henry moves to e1 to bolster the rooks on the d file.} Qb4 39. a3 Qxb3 40. Qb1 Qxa3 41. Qa2+ Qxa2 42. Rxa2 {42. Rxa2 - here I give back a couple of pawns to simplify down to an endgame.  I am getting short of time on my clock.  I have made it to the time control but I have only the minimum time left, 15 minutes.  I think I have sped up a bit since then but I used to get into time trouble a lot in my early games.} Bxd4 43. Rxa7 {43. Rxa7 - this capture is feasible because the dsb is pinned to the black rook.  I would therefore remain the exchange for a pawn up.} Bc3+ 44. Ke2 Rxd1 45. Kxd1 {45. Kxd1 - simplifies further but my clock is ticking down.} Bf6 46. Ke2 h5 47. Kd3 g5 48. h3 Kf7 49. g4 hxg4 {49. hxg4 - here, as I had less than 10 minutes left on my clock I accepted my opponent's offer of a draw.  Given that my opponent's rating was more than 100 points in front of me this was not a bad start.  Over the next two games it gets better.}
