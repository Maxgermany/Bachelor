1. e4 {quite enjoyed this game plus it's my first win against a 1700+ ranked player. I like annotating games on here because of the comments and remarks, really helps me understand the game more. } e5 2. d4 {sorry quite bad with openings, what is white's opening called?} d6 3. c3 Nf6 4. Bc4 Bg4 {not a good move, maybe Nc6 is better} 5. f3 Be6 {moving same piece twice, } 6. Bxe6 fxe6 {exchange } 7. Qa4+ Nc6 8. Bg5 {white's on the attack} Be7 9. Bxf6 {do you think capturing with pawn gxf6 for the exchange is better?} Bxf6 10. d5 {nice defence chain from white, and a weak one this side. normally i'd be thinking to check! but no point, im losing that knight either way.} exd5 11. exd5 Kf8 {this was a mistake! I wanted to go for the castling o-o! still doesn't mean it was the best move. maybe Qd7} 12. dxc6 bxc6 13. Qxc6 Rb8 {thinking the queen won't be able to do anything on it's own in attack! got my eyes on the b2 pawn, not a big deal but i wanted to show some pieces!} 14. Ne2 {white's trying to develop his pieces.} Rxb2 {moving forward, i think this move also denied white to castle. } 15. Ng3 {e5 pawn controlling the middle,  } Rxg2 {why not capture more! maybe bh4 is a better one, but you can decide} 16. Ne4 {still I don't see real threat! } Kf7 {giving some space for rook on h8, after earlier mistake. } 17. Nxf6 {obviously exchange is in white's favour.} gxf6 {I didn't want to move my queen because it's securing the good chain, also this opens g file for my rooks to dominate.} 18. f4 {trying to expose my rook on g2, made me glad the earlier move opened g file for my other rook to cover.} Rhg8 19. Nd2 {moving out of rook's a1 way.} exf4 {just levelled things up point wise. my defending line still looks ok.} 20. Qd5+ {bringing the queen back into the game.} Kf8 {think the best possible} 21. O-O-O Rg2g5 {attacking his queen stops white developing for a minute.} 22. Qd4 c5 {still attacking the queen} 23. Qf2 {could have captured pawn f4, I didn't notice. } Rg5g2 {I don't think this was very wise} 24. Qxf4 {-1 with unnecessary move! things are looking better for white with e file being empty, maybe rook Rf1 covering queen and Ne4.  } Rg8g7 {just didn't want queen to check on h6} 25. Ne4 {pawn on d6 was very weak and could lead to mate in no time} Qe7 {moving out of Rxd6 and maybe going into queen exchange.} 26. Qxf6+ {took me some time to think about this, but though if i could get rook into e7 after queen exchange i have a chance of an attack with the two rooks } Rf7 27. Qh8+ {this move made me panic, I thought mate was on the my door step. one of the reasons is that I only had one move available! turns out that was a blunder!} Rg8 {no way out for queen. } 28. Qxg8+ {please let me know if you think there's a better move, maybe Rf1.} Kxg8 {now on +2.} 29. Rhg1+ Rg7 {still have my eyes on the knight, thinking white won't give away this exchange. } 30. Rxg7+ Qxg7 {now thinking it'll be interesting to see how Rook and knight work together.} 31. Nxd6 Qg5+ {the knight is covered with the rook so no need to pin on Qh6.} 32. Kc2 Qg6+ {just few moves to get some time to think} 33. Kb3 Qe6+ 34. Kc2 Qxa2+ {back to +2} 35. Kc1 {didn't know how to break them.} c4 {giving up on the check for now, } 36. Rg1+ {series of checks, was pretty sure won't lead to any forks or mate!} Kf8 37. Rf1+ Ke7 38. Nf5+ Kd7 39. Rd1+ Ke6 40. Nd4+ {one more check} Ke5 {I kept my eye for any forks.} 41. h4 Qa3+ {hoping for Kb1 so Qxc3.} 42. Kd2 Qb2+ 43. Nc2 a5 {not much I could do with my king.} 44. Re1+ Kd5 45. Re7 {having secured the back, white tries to clear way for h pawn.} a4 {thinking i could get there on time} 46. Rxh7 a3 47. Ra7 a2 {getting a bit difficult to do anything. } 48. h5 Qb1 49. h6 Kc6 {this was panic mode no ideas whatsoever.} 50. h7 Qb8 {took me a life time to do this! simply didn't want to give that pawn on a2 up!} 51. Nb4+ {white decided to not take the pawn and keep me waiting } Kb6 52. Ra6+ Kb5 53. Rxa2 Qd8+ {hoping white king would go somewhere i could fork his pawn.} 54. Kc1 Qh8 {putting the c3 pawn under threat as well as h7. } 55. Kb2 {defending c3} Qxh7 {back to attack.} 56. Ra1 {don't see the point of this move.} Qh2+ 57. Ka3 {white could have played Nc2 and we would back to square one again } Qd2 {threatening to fork on c3} 58. Na2 Qc2 {no where for king to go!} 59. Rc1 Qb3# {very epic game. one last thing the game finished with 2:48 minutes for black vs. 9:48 for white.  }
