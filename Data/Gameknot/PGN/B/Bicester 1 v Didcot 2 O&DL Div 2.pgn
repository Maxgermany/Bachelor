[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 {My usual opening.} d6 {An unusual but flexible response: it could lead to an Old Indian, King's Indian, Sicilian or any number of 1.e4 e5 type openings.} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 {I don't like this move: it blocks up Black's position, though it has potential for varied knight activity.} 4. f4 {I adopt an aggressive approach to limit Black's scope for activity.} g6 {So now we're in Robatsch territory, which I've always enjoyed attacking.} 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Bc4 {Continuing my development as qucikly and aggressively as I can.  The B points at the potentially weak square, f7.} O-O {Black's castling completes his kingside development but his centre and queenside need some work.} 7. e5 {Now I seize the opportunity to disrupt Black's plans with a quick central thrust before I have castled, reasoning that my King is safe for now and Black needs to respond accurately or suffer.} Ne8 {? Black retreats the N passively to e8, overlooking White's response.  He should have swapped on e5 immediately.} 8. e6 {The pawn thrusts into the heart of Black's position, forking the Nd7 and the pawn on f7.  If Black plays fxe6, Bxe6+ follows. But this would have been preferable to Black's actual reply.} d5 {? This just gives up a pawn for nothing.} 9. exf7+ {!  This response wins material as well as further disrupting Black'sposition.} Rxf7 10. Bxd5 {Pinning Black's rook.} e6 {? Another pawn wasted} 11. Bxe6 Qe7 {Pinning the B so that it can't yet win the exchange on f7.} 12. Qe2 {Developing my Q and relieving the pin so that once again I threaten to win the exchange.} Nb6 {At last Black unblocks his queensidebut it's too late: the damage is done.} 13. Bxf7+ Qxf7 14. O-O {Now, having won a significant material plus, I have to spend time consolidating my position before developing a winning attack.} Bg4 {Black develops his B aggressively, pinning my N against my Q and thus threatening to capture on d4 with check.} 15. Qf2 {I sidestep the pin and over-defend the d pawn.} Bxf3 {I hadn't expected Black to start swapping off while material down, but this looks like winning the d-pawn.} 16. Qxf3 {I recaptured with the Q because I didn't want doubled f-pawns.  Now I also threaten the pawn on b7.} Nd6 {Black redevelops his backward N and defends b7, once more threatening to capture on d4 and also threatening to advance an N to c4, whence he can threaten White's position.} 17. Be3 {This developing move defends the d pawn but now ...Nc4 would have forked the Be3 and pawn on b2.  Alternatively, ...Nf5 would have forked Be3 and pawn on d4, when I planned Bf2} Qf5 {Now Black threatens my pawn on c2. } 18. Rac1 {I preferred this to Rf2, which would have prepared doubling on the f-file as well as defending the pawn, because I wanted to keep f2 for my B if I got time to move it.  Now an immediate ...Nc4 would have been annoying.} Re8 {Black preferred to complete his development and occupy the open file before venturing forward with his Ns.  Despite the lost material, Black's position looked quite harmonious a this point and I was struggling to defend all my weak points.} 19. b3 {This made me feel much more comfortable, keeping Black's Ns off c4.} c6 {This frees up Black's Nd6 for aggressive duties.} 20. Rfe1 {Contesting the e-file} Rd8 {So Black sidestepped to the d-file to set up a renewed attack on d4.} 21. Ne2 {Bolstering d4 and preparing c3 and Ng3, when I would be ready to attack once more.} Nd5 {Black centralises this N, attacking my B and threatening to occupy c3 or b4 or attack f4 if I moved the wrong pieces.} 22. Ng3 {I gain a tempo by attacking his Q before I respond directly to Black's Ns.} Qf7 23. c3 {Now my consolidation is complete.  I don't mind if he swaps his active N for my passive B.} h5 {Now Black looks to dislodge my N from g3} 24. Bd2 {This retreat maintains the defence of f4 while opening up the e-file for my rook and freeing the other rook from the duty of defending c3.  Now my plan is to double rooks on the e-file and penetrate the heart of Black's position.} h4 {Black continues his thrust, merely forcing me to move my N to where I want it anyway.} 25. Ne4 {A lovely square for my N.} Nf5 {Black avoids swapping and takes up closer order on my position but he has no serious threats.} 26. Ng5 {Continuing my slow but steady advance on Black's position and harrassing his Q again.} Qf6 {Overlooking my reply but any move would have allowed Ne6, further disrupting his position.} 27. Re6 {Now the R, not the N, occupies e6, skewering Q and g-pawn and setting up a mating attack.} Qf8 {At least the Q and R can't now be forked because the R occupies the forking square ...} 28. Rxg6 {but not for long!} Rd7 {Black avoids the fork and over-defends the B so that his Q can move if attacked.} 29. Re1 {I wanted to play Qh5 immediately but couldn't see a good continuation after ...Nf6.} Nde7 {Attacking the R but I can ignore it because my reply threatens mate.} 30. Qh5 {and Black resigned as he felt his position was hopeless.  He could have prolonged things slightly with  30. ...Qe8 31. Qh7+ Kf8 32. Ne6+ Kf7 33. Nxg7 Nxg6 (33...Nxg7 34. Qxg7 mate) 34. Nxe8+ Kxe8 35. Qxg6+ Kd8 (35. Qg8+ Nf8) when Black has avoided mate but is a whole Q down.  Very satisfying for me and depressing for Tom.  The game had lasted just over an hour.}
