1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Playing the Scotts Game} exd4 4. Nxd4 Qf6 {I found this move interesting. I was hoping for 4...Bc5 5. Be3 Qf6 6. c3 Nge7 7. Bc4 O-O 8. b4. I played c3 hoping that would still happen} 5. c3 Bc5 6. Be3 {Now for Nge7...} Bxd4 {No, black takes} 7. Bxd4 {I take} Nxd4 {Black takes} 8. Qxd4 {I take, hoping to trade queens} Qxd4 {Black takes} 9. cxd4 {And I take} d6 {Black frees their bishop but I think d5 might've been better} 10. d5 {Next move is going to be Bb5+ to try and get a small advantage} Nf6 11. Bb5+ {I choose to go ahead with my original plan instead of defending e4} Bd7 12. Bxd7+ Kxd7 13. Nc3 {Now, I defend my pawn} Rhe8 {Black attacks} 14. f3 {My only move to defend. I don't really like this move because it looks to me like it weakens my king-side but I have to defend my e4 pawn or else I'll lose my d5 pawn soon after and then shortly after, the game} c6 15. Rd1 {Also possible is dxc6 but I didn't like the look of it. I liked this move much better. I didn't like the look of castling either because then he could try organize a queen-side attack } cxd5 {He takes} 16. Nxd5 {I take} Nxd5 {He takes} 17. Rxd5 {I take and we've had another trade-off} Rac8 18. O-O Rc2 19. Rfd1 Re6 20. e5 Rg6 {Trying for the draw} 21. Rd5xd6+ {I refuse} Rxd6 22. Rxd6+ Ke7 {I thought quite a bit what I should do now and decided on} 23. Rd3 {My calculations were that if 23... Rxb2 then 24. Rb3 24... Rxa2 25. Rxb7+ 25... Ke6 26. f4 and although a pawn down, I still had a fighting chance.} Rxb2 24. Rb3 Rxb3 25. axb3 {Black didn't follow my plan but I think I might have chances here. Is it a tied position, a win for black or a win for white? I'm not sure} Ke6 26. f4 Kd5 {This is when I had to be careful. My pawn on b3 is lost but his f pawn is weak so I deduced I still had some fighting chance.} 27. Kf2 Kd4 28. g4 b5 29. Ke2 Kc3 {This proved to be blacks downfall.} 30. f5 a5 31. e6 fxe6 32. fxe6 a4 33. bxa4 bxa4 34. e7 {And black resigned. Thank you for reading and please comment and criticize. Also please rate my annotation so I know how I'm doing with them.}
