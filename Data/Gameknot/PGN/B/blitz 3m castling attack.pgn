[Opening "Bird's opening (A03), Lasker variation"]

1. f4 {Trying to surprise the opponent. Although it may look like a king´s gambit, it does not allow for such development. White clearly opens against his rival king´s side, giving up the center, and can result in a weakened white´s position. And yes, I have no idea how to play this properly, and that is one of the fun things of blitz game. A challenge of ideas will develop from both sides. Hope you enjoy it.} d5 {Black prevents white from doing 2.e4 and therefore set a strong pawn on d4, gaining control of the center.} 2. Nf3 g6 {Choosing a financhetto defense. This may be giving white some time to regain control, but at the same time positions BSB on a very strong diagonal a1-h8.} 3. e3 {Allows for WSB to develo. White could have also played g3 with oppossing mirror defence set up, but thought to set his bishop on a far more active position later on (in spite of leaving his king side weakened)} Bg7 4. Nc3 {Blocks the pressure of the BSB on b2 and allows for a development there for white, trying to trade both bishops.} Nh6 {Interesting. Black may be aiming to do f5 and therefore place a strong pressure on e4, although that would also weaken his "e" pawn.} 5. Bd3 {This seem to be a bad movement , since it blocks "d" advance. But BSB will go to b2 in the next moves, keeping with the idea of giving up the center while pressuring the side. See that in a potential situation, "h" advance will be a strong push there (in case white goes for a long castling)} c6 {Now this seems to be too slow for black, and also doesn´t help Nb8 and Bc8 future development. Since d5 seems to be perfectly fine, Nc6 seems more natural.} 6. b3 Nf5 {Again, not helping much to the cause of black, since it does have no control whatsoever of any strong square. Now, considering its activity on h6, black may be wanting to activate this N, but at the cost of several movements.} 7. Bb2 O-O {So now white is facing an interesting dilema. I thought about going for a queen castling and the push on BK defences, or play safe and go for a short castling.} 8. Na4 { Whit this, white is almost giving up on the long castling. Too many moves to go, allowing black to advance on a-b-c files. A race I wouldn´t like to run second. Now, I felt tempted to do this move since black almost has to go for the trade, or else, going weak on his castling.} Nd6 {Again, a slow move. Maybe white can still do the aforementioned attack idea.} 9. Bxg7 Kxg7 10. O-O {But I didn´t. I still have the feeling is a weak move. Now the push has to go with less firepower, going for something like h3-g4-f5...which can be clearly stopped with f5. Also, black has a very strong jump point on e4.} Nd7 {Mobilizing his forces. Again, control of the centre is the order of the day for black. Maybe with ...f6, e5.} 11. Nc3 {Calling back forces.} Nf6 {This blocks the previously mentioned idea, but sets a very strong N on e4.} 12. h3 {Preparing the g4-f5 advance. White might have also thought about Qe2 and a future e4 advance, but I had this fixation on the pawn advance as the only chance to get something positive out of this situation.} h5 {It seems to weaken black´s defence. It kept me thinking about a potential sacrifice on h5, but is unclear. And black may also find attractive the possibility to mobilize forces on the "h" file with Rh8 and so on.} 13. Ne2 {Again, trying to stack forces on the attack. No real threat yet though.} Nfe4 {See the strong point e4 offers black. But in case of ...f5, Ne5 will give white another one, and g6 (and maybe even the mentioned h5 sacrifice) would be weaken spots.} 14. Qe1 e6 {Maybe a mistake. Blocks WSB action, and does not help with the counterattack black is supposed to be doing at the center, although it keeps white from doing Nh4 comfortably.} 15. Ng3 Nxg3 16. Qxg3 {I had the feeling that I was simplifying the position without a gain.} Ne4 17. Bxe4 dxe4 {Now I saw that I was giving up a pawn, but in exchange, white seems to have some attack (to be demonstrated though)} 18. Ng5 Qxd2 {And black accepts the exchange of blows.} 19. Nxe4 Qxc2 {This positing consumed most of my scarce time. I had the feeling that controling the a1-h8 with the queen would be vital, but did not see how to gain it yet.} 20. Qf3 {Now, I did see the next moves, and how BQ, if not careful, will be removed from her king´s defence, as it happened.} a5 {Black spent a lot of time with this one. You can see that the queen is sort of trapped, cannot go anywhere near the king nor control the centre. Now, what took me most of my thoughts while black was deciding what to do was 20...f5, a weakening movement maybe but also giving black some time to activate his pieces. On that side, look how poorly is BB performing.} 21. Rf2 Qd3 22. Rd1 Qa6 {Now white has a beautiful control of the situation. it is to be exploited for the win, but how to proceed? Opening files andgetting the best of his rooks, I´d say.} 23. g4 hxg4 {Now, which one: hxg or Qxg... ? Both seem tempting, but that a1-h8 was still on my mind, and with the Ne4 I was hoping I could threat Qf6+ somehow while Rg2 moves for the kill.} 24. Qxg4 {But of course there is a price to pay when you dream your next move in advance, instead of checking all the possible opponent´s moves...} f5 {Nope, did not see this one. Was kind of frustrated, but since it also weakened g6 and white has too many active pieces (while black´s Ra8 and Bc8 are basically dead), it seemed worth keep on pushing.} 25. Qg5 fxe4 26. Rg2 Rf6 {A must. It seems black made it on time, but white still has an ace out his sleeve.} 27. Rd8 {!! nice move, keeps the pressure up. White now threats Qh5. BQ cannot become active by giving some checks, but still could come to the defence with Qb5. I´ve just realized that if black had played 22...Qb5 instead of ...Qa6, this wouldn´t have been possible.} Qb6 {Threatening the Rd8 and also a check on e3. But...} 28. Rg8+ Kxg8 29. Qxf6 {Now white´s attack is unstoppable.} Qxe3+ 30. Kh2 Qxh3+ 31. Kxh3 {End of game. Got lucky with the lost N on e4, but I think the moral is that if you have developed your pieces adequately, you end up having B- and C-plans, even when things turn out bad.}
