1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 b6 3. Bb5 {I don't know this opening and don't play it much as black, but I doubt this is good as the bishop can be driven back with tempo} a6 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 c4 6. Bxc4 bxc4 7. O-O e6 8. d4 cxd3 e.p. 9. Qxd3 Be7 10. c4 Nf6 11. h3 {to keep the knight out.. but why not wait until I actually put the knight there, as I probably won't... then you'd play the move with tempo. as it is, it weakens your king} O-O 12. a3 {ignores developing your pieces, my dark squared bishop isn't going to be a big threat on b4 and can be driven away with tempo if he arrives} d6 {questionable... blocks in my bishop, and I forget about playing e5 after this} 13. Bd2 Nc6 14. Nc3 Rb8 15. Rab1 Bb7 16. Ne1 {seems quite passive} Ne5 17. Qe2 d5 18. Nf3 Qd6 {I should have taken e4 I think} 19. Nxe5 {I like this move... great square for the knight... probably would be fine to take on d5 with your c pawn... break up my centre} Rbd8 {duh! blundered here, forgot I could retake the knight!! "chess blindness"} 20. Bf4 {love it} Qb6 21. exd5 exd5 22. cxd5 Nxd5 23. Nxd5 Rxd5 24. Nc4 {hmmm. 'loose pieces drop off'... while this does make the queen move, the queen isn't doing so much there and the knight was maybe better on e5? maybe better to get your rooks activated} Qe6 25. Qf3 {don't like this... on general principles, you are voluntarily skewering your queen} Rb8 {eeep! another unforced blunder!} 26. Bxb8 Qc8 27. Bg3 {Bd6 might have saved things} Qxc4 28. Rfe1 Rd7 29. Qg4 Qc6 30. f3 Bc8 31. Be5 f6 32. Bc3 Qc5+ 33. Kh1 Kf7 34. Rbc1 {you're ahead material, so you might have offered a rook trade... I'd probably have declined thus giving your rooks control of the open files} Rd8 35. Qg3 Bd6 36. Qh4 Qb6 37. Ref1 Bd7 38. Rcd1 Bb8 39. Qxh7 Qc7 40. f4 Qc6 41. f5 Qc7 42. Qg6+ Kg8 43. g3 Bc6+ 44. Kh2 Re8 45. Rde1 Rd8 46. Rf2 Qb6 47. Rfe2 Qb5 48. Bxf6 Rd7 49. h4 {perfect way to seal the deal by marching the pawn down... I'm completely tied up and helpless} Bd6 50. h5 Rf7 51. h6 Rxf6 {oops! but not much could be done against the advancing pawn.} 52. Qxg7# {}
