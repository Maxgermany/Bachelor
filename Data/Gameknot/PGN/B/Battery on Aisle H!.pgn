[Opening "French (C00), Steinitz attack"]

1. e4 {Standard.} e6 {I enjoy a good French, and he plays e5, which, if followed by d5 and then d4 is the closed variation.} 2. e5 d5 {But sadly, he captures en passant, and is left with a terrible center.} 3. exd6 e.p. Bxd6 4. d4 {Trying to stake claim to the center.} Nf6 {Preparing to castle.} 5. Nf3 b6 {Getting ready to fianchetto, and eyeball the Kingside.} 6. Bd3 {He gets ready to Castle, as well; also to the Kingside. Huzzah!} O-O 7. O-O {And now that the Kings are safely tucked away, the battle begins.} Na6 {I played this instead of Bb7 or Nc6 in hopes that he would take, trading his strong Bishop for my useless, rim-bound Knight.} 8. Bxa6 {And he obliges! Now I will have a deadly, unopposed light-squared Bishop in the corner!} Bxa6 {I hoped he would overlook the Rook. He doesn't. Mark this move, because the Bishop's control over the f1 square is very important.} 9. Re1 Ng4 {Bringing heat on the King.} 10. Bg5 Bxh2+ 11. Nxh2 Qxg5 {Here, I miscalculated. I did not see the Queen protecting the g4 square, therefore I overlooked NxN.} 12. Nxg4 f5 {I am down by two, so I try to chase the Knight and bring out my Rook.} 13. Ne5 Rf6 14. Nd2 {Trying to defend.} Rh6 15. Ndf3 {Too little, too late. Qh5 seals the deal, leaving the White King nowhere to run. (f1 is blocked by my Bishop.) } Qh5 {The only move that could save him is f3/f4, but the Knight blocks the way. And here my opponent resigns, since mate is unavoidable.
