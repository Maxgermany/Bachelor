[Opening "Nimzo-Indian defence (E20)"]

1. d4 Nf6 {This is a common way to arrive at the modern Benoni. Essentially, Black puts off committing to the line until White has played a couple more moves, in order to avoid some nasty "anti-Benoni" lines. This is in contrast to the Old Benoni, which is the immediate 1.d4 c5.} 2. c4 e6 {Obviously this opening can still unfold many different ways: we're still in a generic Indian opening right now. Black is still keeping options on the table.} 3. Nc3 c5 {This is the key move of the Benoni. } 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {And this is the basic setup; clearly it can be reached through any number of transpositions but the key pawn structure has now been set up. From here, play may continue in a number of ways, but the semi-open center and lack of Black d-pawn can make for a very fluid struggle for dominance. I like this opening already.} 6. e4 {This is standard. White supports his d-pawn and strengthens his claim to the center. Furthermore, many lines in this opening seem to revolve around an e4-e5 break by White.} g6 {As the Black DSB is blocked in by the d6 pawn, fianchettoing it seems to be called for. This is another place this opening is similar to an Indian defense, but unlike in (e.g.) the King's Indian, the fiachettoed Bishop will not be blocked by a Black pawn on e5.} 7. f4 {This is a popular move, still in the main variations. It gives White a stronger center and may become crucial to an e4-e5 push.} Bg7 8. Bb5+ {The Taimanov Variation. White develops with check, and announces his intentions to really constrict Black's game. The upshot is that Black's best response is 8...Nfd7, cramping his LSB and Queen's Knight. If he tries 8...Nbd7, the game is still playable but Black will have to give up material of some kind after 9.e5.} Nfd7 9. a4 {This seems like a sensible next move: preventing Black from gaining queenside breathing space with an ...a6 ...b5 combination. It turns out that the GK computer considers this still in-book, as well.} a6 {Driving the Bishop away to give Black a little freedom.} 10. Be2 {Upon reflection, I like 10.Bd3 better. At the time, I thought it would have few prospects there, gazing at the sturdy Black kingside pawns, but I failed to anticipate how much pressure Black would soon be putting on my e-pawn.} Qe7 {A couple of database games have the line 10...Qh4+ 11.g3 Qe7 instead, which busts up the White kingside a little more. According to my opponent, he did consider that line but decided weakening my kingside wasn't worth the strength that the g3 pawn could lend to my center.} 11. Qc2 {White defends the e-pawn, as Black was threatening to win it with 11...Bxc3 12.bxc3 Qxe4.} Nf6 {More pressure on e4.} 12. Nf3 {White is beginning to contemplate simply pushing on to e5.} O-O 13. O-O {Both sides get their Kings out of the center.} Re8 {Things are really heating up; Black needs to weaken the White center if he's ever going to get his queenside developed. As White, it was about here that I found myself wishing that I had played Bd3 instead of Be2, because then I'd have a move free to play Re1 and hold the center calmly. But, I didn't, so now I was stuck debating between trying to hold e4, or trying to push e5.} 14. Bd3 {I settled for holding e4. 14.Ng5? doesn't accomplish anything after 14...h6 15.Nf3 Nxe4 16.Nxe4 Qxe4, so I went with the Bishop move, expecting Black's response to be the very-sharp 14...c4!? 15.Bxc4 Nxe4. Now if 16.Nxe4?! Qxe4 17.Qxe4 Rxe4 18.Bd3 Rb4 Black looks pretty strong, so instead White needs to play 16.Re1! and the situation gets even more complex. A sample line might continue 16...f5 17.Bd3 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Qc7!? 19.Bxe4 fxe4 20.Rxe4 Rxe4 21.Qxe4 Qxc3 and now White can force a draw if he wants, or else the shootout begins in earnest!} Bg4 {My opponent has very consistently played solid moves that completely surprise me :) Of course this is good, developing the Bishop and considering removing White's active Knight.} 15. Rb1 {Looking back, I don't like this. I was trying to prepare for either b2-b4 or just the eventualities arising from the Black DSB on the long diagonal, but I think this move is too passive. I think I could have gotten away with 15.e5! (...dxe5 16.Nxe5). I think 15.Bd2 or 15.Re1 were also good options. The GK computer doesn't consider this move an error, but it does quietly drop my perceived advantage by about half a point.} Bxf3 16. Rxf3 {16.gxf3 might actually be better, as counterintuitive as that is. It would lend more support to the center and keep Black out of g4.} Ng4 {Strong. The pressure on e4 has let up a bit, but now there are warning signs to take note of: the Queen has access to my kingside now, and the now-undefended d4 square looks tempting to the newly-freed Black Bishop.} 17. h3 {This basically guarantees a draw (if Black wants it). 17.Ne2 would have kept it interesting.} Bd4+ {Jumping on the weak square. Man, this Bishop is strong here!} 18. Kh1 {Forced (if 18.Kf1?? Nh2+ wins the exchange).} Qh4 {Just like that, a huge pile of Black pieces has appeared next to the White King. The obvious threats are ...Qe1+ and ...Nf2+. The only way to mount a legitimate resistance to the latter is with 19.Nd1, which, while it makes for a *very* interesting position, does not look good for White in the long run. 19.Rf1?? seems to lose outright to ...Qg3 followed by ...Qh2#, so I chose the path I could see clearly. Not very bold of me perhaps, but given the alternatives...} 19. Bd2 {Surrendering the f2 square and essentially forcing Black to draw me: I'm now threatening Be1, which would give me a big advantage. So...} Nf2+ {Inevitable.} 20. Kh2 {Black can't stay, thanks to the Be1 threat.} Ng4+ 21. Kh1 {Two...} Nf2+ 22. Kh2 Ng4+ 23. Kh1 {Three. 1/2-1/2; the game is drawn by threefold repetition (the actual game goes on for an extra move or two because I guess GK stopped automatically adjudicating forced draws? That's kind of annoying). Anyway, ptitroque certainly earned this one; I hope some of you found it an interesting game. Many thanks to my opponent for the game (and the others we're playing as we explore this opening), and thanks to you for reading!}
