1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {The Evans Gambit, which leads to lively play.} Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 6. d4 {White gets a strong center and open lines for his B's in return for the Pawn. Zuckertort needs to make sure he develops quickly.} exd4 7. O-O Bb6 8. cxd4 d6 9. d5 Na5 {Counterattack on the B, gaining a tempo.} 10. Bb2 {Returning the favor by threatening to trap Zuckertort's KR.} Ne7 11. Bd3 O-O 12. Nc3 Ng6 13. Ne2 c5 {Claiming Q-side space.} 14. Qd2 f6 15. Kh1 Bc7 16. Rac1 Rb8 {The men maneuver for positional advantage.} 17. Ng3 b5 18. Nf5 b4 {Pressing forward on the Q-side. But Anderssen's K-side attack is ipso facto more dangerous, as it aims at the Black King.} 19. Rfg1 Bb6 20. g4 {Committing himself to the attack. With his own K-side position now weakened, Anderssen's attack must succeed or he will lose.} Ne5 21. Bxe5 dxe5 {Black's K is now defended only by a Rook and a flimsy shield of Pawns.} 22. Rg3 Rf7 23. g5 {The battering ram.} Bxf5 {Removing one of the dangerous attacking pieces.} 24. exf5 Qxd5 {This move wins a Pawn, but its real purpose is to allow the QR to participate in the defense.} 25. gxf6 {Blasting open the position.} Rd8 26. Rcg1 {Lining up the battery on the target.} Kh8 {Black has little choice.} 27. fxg7+ {Creating a dangerous passed Pawn and sealing in the King.} Kg8 {Practically forced.} 28. Qh6 {Anderssen closes the ring.} Qd6 {After playing this move, Zuckertort resigned.}
