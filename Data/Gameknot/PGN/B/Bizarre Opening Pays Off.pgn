1. a3 {My plan was to get out of book as soon as possible, and go for a defensive setting, where a computer struggles for ideas.} Nf6 2. h3 e5 3. Rh2 {Well this is definitely out of book now.} d5 4. g3 Nc6 5. Bg2 Bc5 6. e3 O-O 7. Ne2 Re8 8. Kf1 {Having played Rh2, I have to castle 'manually'.} Bf5 9. Kg1 Bb6 10. Kh1 Be4 11. d3 Bxg2+ 12. Rxg2 Qd7 13. Rh2 Ne7 14. Qg1 Rad8 15. Nd2 Nf5 16. b3 c5 17. Bb2 Bc7 {Although Fritz as black is clearly better, he (or she), hasn't taken advantage like a human player would (or should).} 18. Qg2 Ba5 {An annoying move, as I have to defend the Knight in order to continue my plan.  I avoid 26.Nf3, as 26...e4 is unpleasant.} 19. Rd1 b5 20. Nb1 Nd6 21. Rg1 a6 {Too slow...now with my pieces in 'perfect' position, I launch phase 2 of my ludicrous plan.} 22. g4 Qe6 23. h4 Nd7 24. h5 Bc7 25. Nd2 Nb6 {Black really is missing his opportunity to blow the centre open.} 26. Nf3 e4 27. Nh4 Rdc8 {More dithering.  Fritz can calculate a mate in 20, but not see that 27...d4 is intuitively better.  I'm not going to miss an opportunity to close up the centre.} 28. d4 Nb7 29. Rh3 c4 30. b4 Nd6 31. c3 Rca8 {Black is reduced to attacking down the a-file and it becomes a pawn race to open up the files.} 32. g5 a5 33. g6 fxg6 {I was worried here that 34.hxg6 h6, would block the attack, but perhaps better than my actual move would have been to interpose with 34.bxa5 Rxa5, taking the rook out of the game first.} 34. h6 {Now, 34...gxh6 allows 35.Nf4 Qf7 (probably best) 36.Nhxg6 hxg6, and white has so many options, that whilst I can't find a win, I also can't believe that he isn't better.} axb4 {36.Nxg6 is now a possibility, but I cant see a plan after 36...Qxg6, so...} 35. hxg7 {Black better not take on g7, as after 36.Nf4, something bad will happen on g6.} bxa3 {Here Nf4 is probably better, but still losing.  But my next move gives black the chance to make a mistake.} 36. Nxg6 {Here 36...Qxg6 is winning.  After 37.Qh2 Qf5, white's attack will fizzle out.} hxg6 37. Nf4 {37...Qf5 is a possibility here, where white can play 38.Nxg6, and the position is unclear (at least to me).  38...axb2 allows 39.Nf8, where black's best bet is to sacrifice the queen with 39...Qxh3 40.Qxh3 Rxf8.  Or perhaps white could try 38.Bxa3 first.} Qf6 {Again, here 38.Bxa3 is an option, but after 38...Rxa3 39.Rh8+ Kf7 40.Ngxg6, black can calmly (or not calmly!) play Raa8.  38.Nxg6 is again possible, but 38....Nxf5 looks a solid defence.  So I try something more ambitious...} 38. Qh2 axb2 {Once more, 38.Nxg6 can be played, but 38...b1=Q (and not 38...Ra1, else the rook comes to h8+ and then f8+), and giving up the pawn is well worth it for Qxg6, and black is winning.} 39. Rxg6 b1=Q+ 40. Kg2 {Black has a few options here, but not all of them are necessarily good.  For example 40...Kf7 41.g8=Q Ke7 allows a four-queens game where white can win with 42.Rh7+ Kd8 43.Qh4!!.  After 41... Rxg8 42.Rh7+ Rg7 43.Qh5!! is a real killer.  Also, 40...Ra1 falls to 41.Rh8+ Kf7 42.Rf8+ Ke7 43.Rgxf6 Qf1+ 44.Qg2, and white ends up better off.    } Qxg6+ 41. Nxg6 {It's easy to see black's next move as one that loses the game, but in truth, it's hard to see how he should proceed.  E.g. 41...Kxg7 loses to 42.Rh7+ and 43.Qh5 whether or not black takes the knight.  Also, after 41...Nf7 comes 42.Rh8+ Kxg7 43.Rh7+ Kg8 44.Qxc7 Kxh7 45. Qxf7 Kh6, white can force perpetual check with 46.Ne7.  And after 41...Nf5 42.Qxc7, maybe it's black who wants to take the perpetual check with Nxe3+ and N-g4+  Perhaps best is 41...Nd7 and after 42.Rh8+ Kf7 43.Qh7 Rg8! is the correct defensive move losing a rook after 44.Rxg8 Rxg8 45.Nh8+ Kf6 46.Qxg8, but by blocking the queening square allows enough time for 46...Qd1.} Qd1 42. Rh8+ Kf7 43. Qf4+ {The only possible defence now is 43...Ke6 where after 44.Nf8+ Rxf8 45.Rxf8 Rxf8 46.gxf8=Q is unclear, but I suspect black might want to give up a pawn in exchange for getting rid of one of the queens with 46.Qf3+.} Nf5 {And now it's mate in 5.} 44. Qxf5+ Kxg7 45. Rh7+ Kxh7 46. Ne7+ Kh8 47. Qf6+ Kh7 48. Qg6+ Kh8 49. Qh6# {A nice ending, but I certainly don't recommend the gameplan.}
