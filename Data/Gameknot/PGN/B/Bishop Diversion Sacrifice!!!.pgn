1. d4 d5 {If played right, I can amount a huge force on the d4 square, and conquer it.} 2. e3 {Or not.} Nc6 3. c3 e5 4. Bb5 Bd7 5. Bxc6 Bxc6 6. dxe5 {Yep...definitely NOT according to plan.} Qd7 7. Nf3 O-O-O 8. O-O Re8 9. b3 f6 10. exf6 Nxf6 11. Qd4 Kb8 {Stopping Qxa7.} 12. Ne5 Qd6 {?? Idiot! Woodpusher! These were my thoughts directly after this move.} 13. Nf7 Qd7 14. Nxh8 Ng4 15. Qd3 Qd8 {I wanted to play Qh5.} 16. Qxh7 {Not anymore.} Bd6 17. Nf7 {Phooey. I had plans such as Bxh7+ Kh8 Rxh1 and winning the Queen. Yeah, right! Should've known that wouldn't have happened!} Bxh2+ 18. Kh1 Qe7 19. Qg6 Be5 20. Qxg4 Qxf7 {Glad to be rid of the Knight on f7!} 21. Kg1 {Crud.} Rh8 22. g3 Bd7 23. Qe2 {I need that Queen off of the d1-h5 diagonal. Then it hit me! My opponent likes gobbling material (who doesn't?), so why not bait him? Bb5 might do the trick!} Bb5 24. Qxb5 {I could hear my Bishop snickering as it disappeared down the Queen's gullet. } Qh5 {Checkmate is unavoidable, save 25.Kg2.} 25. f4 {But no, he slips the noose over his head.} Qh2# {So here ends this game, played by me and my valiant opponent. I won 9 points down, but with one more King than my opponent! Thanks for reading! Please R&C!}
