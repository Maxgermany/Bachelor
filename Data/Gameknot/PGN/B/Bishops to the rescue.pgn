1. e4 {There is very little annotation to this game as I think the game is pretty interesting by its own accords. I will comment a little more around move 18. as that is where the action begins to pick up. } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 a6 7. Na3 Be6 {Not a superb move but I wanted to develop and this is really the only post for the bishop currently. Perhaps 7... Nc6 would have been better. However the hot water I get into later is saved by the bishop pair. } 8. Bg5 Be7 9. f3 Nc6 10. Qd2 Qb6 11. O-O-O {Here comes the trouble for black...} d5 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. exd5 {After a little wrangling both pieces are salvaged. } O-O-O 14. Nc4 Qa7 15. Qe2 Nd4 16. Qe4 Bd7 {16... Bf5 looks better here, however White's uncoordinated assault will give way to Black's prepared and coordinated attack. } 17. Nd6+ Kb8 18. Nxf7 {Now things get interesting. I deliberated for a long time as to which rook I should move, then hesitantly played 18... h6 to prepare for 20...Bg5  Black not only will win back the material gained by White but also launch a severe attack. } h6 19. Nxd8 Bf5 20. Qe1 {Forced. The only other unthreatened post e3 results in the pin prepared by 18... h6. Driving back the queen is essential here to Black's plans. } Bg5+ 21. Kb1 Bxc2+ 22. Ka1 Bxd1 23. Qxe5+ {Not what I was expecting. I thought that White would take the Bishop and Black would capture the Knight. Taking the Queen away leaving the King barely defended proves much too dangerous. } Ka8 24. Nxb7 Nc2+ 25. Kb1 Qxb7 26. f4 Na3+ 27. Ka1 Bf6 28. Bxa6 Qxa6 29. Qe6 Nc2+ 30. Kb1 Bxc3 {?? I had some rational for this at the time...but now it looks like a mistake. I can see no reason for White not to take the Queen on a6...     Almost any move is better than this one, but notably I think Qb7 is best. White can force the queen exchange if he wishes, but black is still on the offensive and can bring his rook to b8. } 31. Rxd1 {?? Apparently he did, a mistake on both our parts I think. } Na3+ 32. Kc1 {not 32. bxa3 which leads to mate in two.} Bxb2+ {Another move which I took a long time to take. A seemingly free bishop, however any line after 33. Kxb2 I found a direct route to Checkmate or winning White's Queen. } 33. Kxb2 {Here we go...} Rb8+ 34. Kc3 Qc4+ 35. Kd2 Rb2+ 36. Ke1 {Lot's of dancing. And now the fatal blow. } Nc2+ 37. Kf2 {White's only move. And now the discovered check wins the queen.} Nd4+ {White Resigns.    A very interesting game with many complex parts to it. If anyone understands why 31. Qxa6 is a bad move please enlighten me, if not chalk it up to a mistake by both sides.   Fatal to White here (other than missing the free queen which would also have  lead to a captured knight at least) was the premature attack against Black's King. With just the knight white was able to fork the rooks, but Black's response not only won back the material it also enabled strong pressure on White's King putting it on the defensive almost the entire conclusion of the game. }
