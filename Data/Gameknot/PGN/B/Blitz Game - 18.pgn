1. e4 c6 {Caro-Kann Defence. I've become familiar with this.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {Advance Variation. I like this as Black because I need to worry less about tricky manoeuvring and more about the c5-d4 battle (my pawn will move to c5 soon). On ho!} Bf5 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bg5 {(?!) I was a bit surprised by this. It's very interesting what he's done and I wasn't sure how to react. 5. ... f6 seemed to weaken my kingside more than needed, and I didn't want to play 5. ... Ne7 or 5. ... Be7 because I wanted my Bishop to be able to take at c5 once I pushed my c-pawn. So I played my favourite move of this opening.} Qb6 {I very much like the Qb6-Bc5 barrage aiming at f2. It cripples White if he can't castle fast enough. However, castling doesn't take much effort.} 6. b3 {I thought this move weakened important squares, however I later realised it was one of White's better options. 6. Qc1 is quite immobilising, and 6. Bc1 just wastes time developing the Bg5. He wants to keep that pawn.} Bb4+ {(?!) Perhaps better is 6. ... c5.} 7. Nfd2 {(?) Better is 7.c3, cleanly shunting off the Bb4 and strengthening d4. If 7. ... Bxb1 8. cxb4 Qxb4+ 9. Bd2 ... 10. Rxb1.} c5 {(?) Misses out on 7. ... Qxd4. Ah well, it's just a blitz.} 8. dxc5 {Wants to get the pin off his Nd2, and to be able to develop his Nb1. } Bxc5 {But now he has to worry about f2.} 9. Qe2 {Leaves the c2 pawn hanging.} Nc6 10. Be3 {(?) Moves his dark-sq Bishop for the 2nd time.} d4 11. Bf4 {3rd Time. White has lost a move, in essence. In chess, this is called the tempo. In this case, White has lost several tempi, and it's Black's turn to pounce.} Nge7 12. g4 Bxc2 {(?!) When I made this move, I hesitated. Was it the right move to make, or not? I was contemplating 13. Nc4, with a discovered attack on c2, while attacking the Qb6. 13. ... Qb4+ 14. Bd2 wasn't good enough. I thought of 13. Nc4 d3 14. Nxb6 dxe2 15. Nxa8 exf1Q+ 16. Rxf1 Kd7, but something about this variation didn't seem comfortable to me.} 13. Bh3 d3 {(!) A strong pawn move, marching right into White's personal space.} 14. Qf3 {The White Queen has very little squares to land.} Nd4 {I move in more pieces for the kill. I was afraid that I might lose my aggressive advantage.} 15. Qe4 {A central square, aiming at b7 and h7 respectively. This queen may prove deadly in future, however, this pins the Nd2 to its spot, for if it moves, ... d2+ is a discovered attack on white's Queen. However, if it so happens that 16. Nc4 d2+ 17. Nbxd2 Qb4 18. Qg2, then White is in a better position. Black must be economical with his pieces.} Nd5 {Moving more of the infantry in. At this moment, I am quietly worried about my uncastled King, but no immediate threats means I have to keep the aggressive advantage and keep White's options closed.} 16. g5 {White looks into a kingside attack. This I am quite scared of, but I know that my attack should be sufficient for this not to matter much.} Rc8 {Poise my Black rook quietly for the kill. I won't launch a premature attack until everyone is in on it.} 17. g6 {Sacrificing the pawn on g6 for some attacking pressure.} hxg6 {I remain concerned about any possible threats with 18. Bxe6 fxe6 19. Qxg6+, but as long as either my Queen or my Knight is covering the e6 square, I should be fine.} 18. Bg4 Bxb1 {(!) I launch my attack on White's King, staring by vacating the c2 square for my Nd4, to fork Ke1 and Ra1.} 19. Rxb1 {19. Nxb1 leads to 19. ... Nc2+, forking Ke1 and Ra1.} Nc3 {(!) Forks both Rb1 and Qe4 successfully.} 20. Qg2 {The only safe spot for White's Queen. 20. Qe3 leads to 20. ... Nc2+ and White's Q is outta here!} Nxb1 {Grabbing material, and also clearing one piece away from a desired open c-file for my Rook.} 21. Nxb1 Nc2+ 22. Kd1 {(?!) Perhaps 22. Kf1 was better.} Bxf2 23. Bd2 {White tries his best to overcome Black's chokehold...} Ne3+ {...but to not much avail. Threatening Nxg2.} 24. Bxe3 Qxe3 {(!) The right capture. Now Black's arsenal is mostly pointed at White's King, except for the Rh8 stranded in the corner. The Nb1 and Rh1 are in their original places, unable to do anything about the coming invasion. This underscores the importance to develop fast and co-ordinate your pieces.} 25. Nd2 {Blocking Rc1#.} Rc2 {Threatening 26. ... Qxd2#. The only way to the delay the onslaught now is 26. Qxf2 Qxf2, but the end is inevitable.} 26. Nf1 Rc1# {Qc1# is also acceptable in this scenario. As is Qe1#.   The importance of co-ordinating pieces in a seemly fashion is a rare skill in chess, of which the grandmasters know deeply about. The harmonious development of pieces, each piece serving its purpose, is very important. The only improvement I would make about Black's position is the castling of his king, which is hard because of the doubled g-pawns, but Black needed to make an aggressive attack in order to sieze the opportunity, and he did. I mean, I did.  Thanks for watching! You're a great listener, and hope you enjoyed!}
