1. d4 {So this was my third consecutive draw against stronger opponents. The time limit was once again 40 moves in 90 minutes, then an extra 30 minutes if you run out of time, plus 30 seconds per move.} d5 {I had arrived a few minutes late, due to an accident on the A55.} 2. c4 {I play a Queen's Gambit. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit} e6 {He declines in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit_Declined} 3. Nc3 {I continue.} Nf6 {He also plays the main line.} 4. Bg5 {I have always played this, although I see that Nf3 is more popular now.} Be7 {This is the most popular reply.} 5. e3 {I play this, so that I can recapture immediately on c4, should he take. I see that Nf3 is still more popular.} h6 {Although castling immediately is more popular, I think this is a wise move by black. If nothing else it avoids the variation O-O 6. Qc2 h6 7. h4?!} 6. Bh4 {So I drop back.} O-O {He castles.} 7. Nf3 {I finally develop this knight.} Ne4 {With this move my opponent opts for the Lasker variation, a solid line, often leading to the exchange of two sets of minor pieces. It was this line that Viswanathan Anand chose in the final game of the World Chess Championship 2010 in order to defeat Veselin Topalov and retain the world championship.} 8. Bxe7 {So I take, the most common reply.} Qxe7 {He takes back.} 9. Nxe4 {This capture is not the most common reply, but it seems to me the most principled - trying to take advantage of black's doubled pawns.} dxe4 {He recaptures} 10. Nd2 {Knight drops back.} e5 {Although this has been played at this juncture, and it is playable, but afterwards my opponent said that he had forgotten that you are meant to play f5 first.} 11. d5 {Refusing to undouble his pawns.} f5 {Now he does have to protect e4.} 12. Be2 {I develop.} Nd7 {So does he.} 13. O-O {And I castle.} Nf6 {As played in gambit7 (1685) vs. schaakhamster (1726) where white continued with Qb3. I chose differently. } 14. Qc2 {The idea is to prevent f5-f4 as it means I can take on e4 if he plays that advance. I was wondering later if maybe Qb1 was better, also threatening b2-b4. What do you think dear reader?} Kh8 {My opponent said later that he thought that this was a waste of time, but I think in some variations it is better to have the king off the a2-g8 diagonal. I thought he was preparing g7-g5. I had a long think here.} 15. Rfd1 {This is what I eventually played.} Bd7 {I had been expecting g7-g5 followed by Qh7 preparing f5-f4.} 16. b4 {Now if he takes immediately, I have Rd-b1 and I win his b pawn.} f4 {So he comes in with this.} 17. Nxe4 {So I take the pawn as planned.} Nxe4 {He takes back.} 18. Qxe4 {I take.} Bf5 {He hits my queen.} 19. Qf3 {Forced!} Qxb4 {He gets his pawn back. I can't get it back with Rd-b1 as at the moment his Bf5 guards b1.} 20. e4 {So I play this.} Bc8 {With any other retreat black loses the b pawn.} 21. Qh5 {Attacking e5.} Qe7 {Protecting e5.} 22. c5 {And drawn on white's suggestion. I think I had something like 35 minutes to make move 40, he had far more time. White has an advantage here, but I don't think it is a winning advantage. What do you think dear reader? grade me, and if I had more time, or needed a win I would have played on.
