1. b4 {!? There's a book out with the amusing title "Play 1. b4!: Shock your opponents with the Sokolsky". I have to admit, it personally never failed to shock me so far, because it is so unusual! White doesn't occupy the center, but plans to do that indirectly with the dark-squared bishop which will be placed on the long diagonal soon. Another opening following that strategy, which is probably more calm (because the pawn isn't placed on Black's dark-squared bishop diagonal immediately) is 1. b3 -- this is called the "Nimzowich/Larsen Attack".} e5 {Alright, immediately attacking the pawn and occupying the center!} 2. Bb2 {With the queen-side fianchetto bishop, a counter-attack on my pawn is started.} Bxb4 {I decide to exchange my central pawn to White's non-central queen-side pawn, an action which increases the opponents impact on the center. But for that, I enjoy a gain of development. Another very interesting option, which maintains central control and has been played frequently by grandmasters, would have been 2... f6.} 3. Bxe5 {Performs the indirect pawn exchange and threatens to take on g7 as a little bonus.} Nf6 {Defends g7, develops the knight and prepares to castle king-side. The other option, namely 3... f6?!, looks dubious to me.} 4. Nf3 {Simple development.} O-O {King-side is fully developed now, the next few moves have to focus on the movement of the queen-side pieces which have been quite lazy till now.} 5. e3 {Letting out the other bishop as well.} Nc6 {Developing with a gain of tempo. If White doesn't want me to possess the pair of bishops (and thus the minor imbalances), he has to move his attacked dark-squared bishop...} 6. Bb2 {... which he does of course.} d5 {Time for gaining some central control with my d-pawn. In earlier games I preferred to play d6 instead of the last knight move to banish the opponents bishop, but I figured out it would be better to perform a double-step with the pawn because it increases central control and -- for me personally more important, because that often has been a problem! -- it enables my bishop to retire to d6 or e7, in case it is attacked or wants to aim for the king-side.} 7. Be2 {Calm development which prepares king-side castling.} Bg4 {I'm not sure whether this can be considered a good move. It looks very active to me and I usually like pinning my opponents knight with the bishop, but in this case it isn't pinned at all; quite the contrary, it could be dangerous for me, because if White's knight moves, my bishop is under attack and he threatens to win material.} 8. h3 {?! This move weakens White's king-side pawn structure and enables a nice attack a few moves later. I guess the opponent should better have castled immediately instead of trying to get rid of my bishop.} Bh5 {I prefer keeping on that diagonal.} 9. O-O Re8 {Possessing the half-open e-file.} 10. d4 {Increasing central control, but also limiting the scope of the dark-squared bishop -- following the definition, it is a "bad bishop" now.} Ne4 {The knight has a nice home there for a short time, as it can't be attacked by the d-pawn anymore.} 11. Nfd2 {Of course, White wants to get rid of my knight by attacking it with a knight of his own. Besides of that, my light-squared bishop is under attack, so I have to do something about that.} Bg6 {Enabling to recapture with the bishop, in case White wants to exchange knights (which I have to assume).} 12. c3 {Okay, White decides to attack my bishop before. Notice that this move blocks White's dark-squared bishop even more. His only possibility for active play would be on a3 by now.} Bd6 {My bishop retreats to a place that is better anyway, aiming White's king-side. At this point I was glad about my decision to take a double step with the d-pawn earlier in the game. If the pawn were on d6, my bishop would have to reside on the queen-side, being really useless.} 13. Nxe4 {Okay, finally the expected knight exchange.} Bxe4 {Both of my bishops are already aiming at the king-side by now. White's pieces are not very active and his knight isn't developed at all.} 14. c4 {White wants to open things up, forcing me to lose my remaining central pawn.} Ne7 {I would have only done a favor to White if I took with the pawn. Instead, I wanted to recapture with the knight to place it more centrally.} 15. cxd5 Nxd5 16. Nc3 {White finally develops his knight with a double attack on Black's knight and bishop.} Nxc3 {Forced, if I don't want to lose the pair of bishops (or material, of course).} 17. Bxc3 {Now it's bishops against bishops, a constellation which I always find very interesting and often very sharp.} Qg5 {Threatens mate, which can easily be prevented by White.} 18. f3 {?? However, my opponent took the wrong decision. I don't think 18. Bf3 would have caused him any troubles at all. But through the pawn move, the king-side is weakened.} Qg3 {! Exploiting the hole on g3, that was created through the last move which weakened the pawn structure. This possibility is the reason why I marked White's 8th move (h3) as not so good. Maybe a bit far-fetched, however. } 19. Be1 {Hooray, the mate in two I hoped for is working this way! But as soon as I can tell the mate can't be avoided anyway at this stage.} Qh2+ 20. Kf2 Bg3# {Mate with by bishop, nice one. A nice example showing how to create king-side attack. However, as mentioned earlier, I guess the major mistake by White here was 18. f3??, so he helped me very much. On 18. Bf3 we likely would have played an ordinary, overall equal endgame. I have to check what Fritz says on that. Anyways, I hope you had fun reading this annotation and feel free to comment, for whatever reason (critique, praise, suggestions...)!}
