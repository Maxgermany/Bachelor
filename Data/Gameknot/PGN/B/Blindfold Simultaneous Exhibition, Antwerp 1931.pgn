1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 {The standard position of the Caro-Kann. Black has a number of playable options.} Nf6 {Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann would be pleased. This was their way of attacking White's centarlized Knight -- certainly the most direct method to challege the horseman.} 5. Bd3 {Against a fellow master, Koltanowski -- and most modern grandmasters -- would undoubtedly play 5 NxN, inflicting a weakness in the Black Pawn structure. Against a mere amateur, however, he elects to retain the central tension.} Qxd4 6. Nf3 {Developing with tempo, attacking the Q.} Qd8 7. Qe2 Bf5 {Threatening to drain off all the White attacking power with 8... NxN 9 BxN BxB 10 QxB, and thus forcing White's hand.} 8. Nxf6+ {Initiating the attack and weakening the Black K-side.} gxf6 {Forced, as the KP is pinned.} 9. Bxf5 {Leaving Black no alternative if he doesn't want to be down a piece.} Qa5+ {The only way to regain the piece.} 10. Bd2 {Clearing the way for his next move.} Qxf5 {The only piece Black has in play is his Q. He must immediately try to find a haven for his King and get his pieces activated.} 11. O-O-O {Seizing the open file with his Rook. Black's best course of action is probably 11... N-Q2 followed by 12... O-O-O.} Qe6 {Instead, Black gets greedy. He thinks he's forcing Koltanowski to exchange Queens or lose another Pawn.} 12. Qd3 {Koltanowski has a different plan.} Qxa2 {Black's fatal error. 12... N-Q2 was still probably best, to be followed by 13... O-O-O.} 13. Qd8+ {Koltanowski pounces.} Kxd8 {Forced.} 14. Ba5+ {A deadly double check.} Kc8 {14... K-K1 is answered the same way.} 15. Rd8# {Finis.}
