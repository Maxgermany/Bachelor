[Opening "Sicilian (B52), Canal-Sokolsky attack, Bronstein gambit"]

1. e4 {This is the game that earned me the dubious distinction/accusation of being a "Romantic" player.  Now that I look back on it, although it was wide-open, it was still fairly sound throughout.  This is simply an example of the advantage of playing white.  If you want to attack, you can.  I started with the most popular opening, e4.} c5 {The beginning of the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 {This is a quick attacking setup that allows for early bishop pressure on the queen's pawn.} d6 {By advancing the queen's pawn, this opens the possibility for an early check.} 3. Bb5+ {Which I decide to make.} Bd7 {It's either this or Nd7.} 4. Bxd7+ {I force the issue rather than playing Nc3 or Na3.} Qxd7 {Nxd7 restricts the queen; Qxd7 allows more freedom but also places the queen in front of the king.  With the white bishop gone, this isn't as dangerous as it could be.} 5. O-O {White and black are under-developed, but there are interesting opportunities for attack.  The king is still vulnerable, and the b7 pawn is potentially weak.} Nf6 {Black wants to castle quickly.} 6. e5 {But with the knight at f3 and no other support, the early e-attack is available.  You don't see this often, but it caused all sorts of chaos.} dxe5 {The pawn capture is fairly safe, but, in this scenario, it allows white to put immediate pressure on the queen.  Moving the knight might have been better.} 7. Nxe5 {White is quite under-developed, but causing all amounts of grief for black.} Qc7 {The only problem with this is that the queen is, at least on the short-term, being marginalized.} 8. Re1 {Why move?  Bolster the knight and see how black responds.} e6 {Nc6 might have been better} 9. c4 {Opening up the possibility for a queen check and beginning to establish center control.} Bd6 {This is smart.  Creates a strong queen-bishop line while simultaneously developing the board and attacking the pesky knight.} 10. Qa4+ {Hello!  I think she forgot about this possibility.  If you have a chance to halt the castle, it can often cause great pain for the opponent.} Nbd7 {All of black's mid-level pieces are out and the king can castle in either direction, if need be.  But, the attack is not necessarily over.} 11. Nf3 {I am fairly certain I contemplated Nxd7, but backed off to defend against the bishop-queen line.  f4 might have been interesting and unusual.} O-O {Black finally castles.  Both white and black are missing a center pawn, but black is better developed.  c5 is isolated but well protected.  Things look good for black.} 12. g3 {With Nf3, I protected against the bishop-queen attack.  This move really wasn't necessary, but it does permit the knight to move again.  } b6 {Opening up the possibility of an attack on the unprotected knight.} 13. Nc3 {White finally gets around to developing his mid-level pieces.} a6 {Prevents Nb5.} 14. Ne4 {Rather than developing, I elected to continue to attack unabated.} Nxe4 {Black elects to trade.} 15. Rxe4 {Although it's easy to harass the rook, there are interesting attack possibilities here that should cause black some concern.} Nf6 {Go away!} 16. Rh4 {No, I want to attack!} Qb7 {This establishes a good line on the castle but further marginalizes the queen.} 17. Qd1 {White brings their queen back to center and a more traditional, if early, position.} Rad8 {This is a solid, developing move that establishes future control of the d file.} 18. d3 {Freeing up the bishop and strengthening e4 against attack.} Be7 {This completes the earlier rook move, and sets up the potential for pressure on the advanced rook.} 19. Bg5 {White finally develops all mid-level pieces and continues to be aggressive.} Ne8 {Black again offers the trade.} 20. Bxe7 {White continues to attack and accelerate the game.} Qxe7 {Black's only real response.} 21. Ne5 {This square was open and one of the responses is f7, which weakens the castle.  Also, sets up a fork at Nc6 and bolsters the d3 pawn.} Qd7 {Obviously, Qd6 or Qf6 were the desired move.  But, as I've certainly proven in my own play, sometimes big blunders happen.  Apparently, all the aggressive "romantic" play stressed black into a beginner's blunder.  Black immediately resigned.  She was quite flustered.  I was right there the night before.  I know how embarrassing such moves are.  In any event, this was my first tournament win and certainly memorable.    With the benefit of hindsight, I have to admit my play was surprisingly aggressive.  As I recall, at the time, I was anxious to try e4 ... Nf3 ... Bb5 and this game set itself up for such an opening.  Such an aggressive opening seems to have been infectious to my later play.    But for the bad queen move, this position shows a modest advantage to white albeit with the advanced knight and advanced rook.  Black would do well to repel such attacks and slowly develop the pawns while hopefully forcing the advanced pieces out of position.  White and black are both without bishops so the game becomes more "vertical."    This game could have easily ended in a draw.}
