[Opening "King's Indian (E87), Saemisch, orthodox, Bronstein variation"]

1. d4 {This was played in the first round of the British Over 50s Chess Championships in Llandudno. Although I was out-rated I managed to draw the game.} Nf6 {I had looked up some of his games, and saw that he played the King's Indian Defence, and I rattled out the first moves very quickly.} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {The King's Indian is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with his pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it with the moves ...e5 or ...c5. Until the mid-1930s, it was generally regarded as highly suspect, but the analysis and play of three strong Soviet players in particular—Alexander Konstantinopolsky, Isaac Boleslavsky, and David Bronstein—helped to make the defence much more respected and popular. It is a dynamic opening, exceptionally complex, and a favourite of former world champions Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, and Mikhail Tal, with prominent grandmasters Viktor Korchnoi, Miguel Najdorf, Efim Geller, John Nunn, Svetozar Gligorić, Wolfgang Uhlmann, and Ilya Smirin having also contributed much to the theory and practice of this opening. In the early 2000s the opening's popularity suffered after Vladimir Kramnik scored excellent results against it, so much so that even Kasparov gave up the opening after relentless losses to Kramnik. However, Kramnik himself won a fine game on the black side of the KID in 2012, and current top players Hikaru Nakamura, Teimour Radjabov and Ding Liren all play the opening.} 4. e4 d6 5. f3 {This is Sämisch variation, a subtle blockading system and a critical challenge to the King's Indian.[1] It is named after the German Grandmaster Friedrich Sämisch. The Sämisch has been played by numerous grandmasters, including world champions Mikhail Botvinnik, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov.  Bobby Fischer had trouble against the Sämisch. Mednis' How to Beat Bobby Fischer showed that five of Fischer's losses were against the Sämisch King's Indian, and remarked that Fischer eventually avoided the King's Indian if he believed he would face the Sämisch.[2] Fischer faced the Sämisch five times against Boris Spassky in their 1992 rematch, however—winning two, drawing two and losing one.  In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), the Sämisch Variation is covered in chapters E80 to E89 } O-O 6. Be3 e5 7. d5 Nh5 8. Nge2 f5 9. Qd2 a6 10. O-O-O Nd7 {This is where I had to start thinking. Up to now we had been following another game by Mark Page. In that one, black played 10.....b7-b5, white replied c4-c5 and the game was eventually drawn. 10.....Nd7 prepares b7-b5 but prevents c4-c5. I have to play actively before he gets in this thrust.} 11. exf5 {So that if he ever plays f5-f4, I will have a lovely e4 square for my knight. } gxf5 {Of course not 11....Rxf5?? 12. g4 winning a piece.} 12. g4 {One idea is to divert his f pawn away from protecting the e4 square, allowing me to play Ne4.} fxg4 {He takes.} 13. fxg4 {I take back.} Nf4 {Afterwards my opponent was critical of this move, as giving up a pawn for not enough compensation, but in my opening databases, this has always been played rather than the timid Nf6.} 14. Nxf4 {So I take.} exf4 {He takes back.} 15. Bxf4 {and I take back.} Nc5 {He commented afterwards he wasn't sure if this knight should go to c5 or e5. In my opening databases, it seems that the knight normally goes to e5. OK what would you play now?} 16. h3 {I thought that this was logical, protecting g4, but after the game my opponent correctly pointed out afterwards that 16. Bh6! is much better exchanging his powerful dark squared bishop. If he plays 16.... Bxg4 I simply exchange on g7 and then play 18. Rg1! winning his bishop (if 18...h5 then 19. h3), and if he exchanges first I still have the killing pin on his bishop if he takes on g4.} Qf6 {I had a long think here. I was looking at Bg5, but eventually came to the conclusion that I was simply driving his queen to a better square and my bishop could be vulnerable on that square. Plus on e3, the bishop could take on c5 in some variations. } 17. Be3 {which is why I retreated.} Bd7 {Preparing b7-b5. What would you play here dear reader?} 18. Kb1 {This is what I played, but it is a mistake. I should have played Bd4, exchanging off his Bg7.} b5 {So he correctly sacrifices a pawn to open up lines on the queen side.} 19. cxb5 {So I take.} axb5 {He takes back.} 20. Bxb5 {I finally develop this bishop.} Bxb5 {He takes.} 21. Nxb5 {I take back.} Rfb8 {He hits my knight.} 22. Nd4 {I retreat, blocking the long dark diagonal. What would you play here for black?} Qg6+ {Did you find it? I think black has the advantage now. What would you play as white?} 23. Qc2 {I played this, the only move. I offered a draw, I realised I had let black into the game, and he now had the advantage. What would you play here as black?} Na4 {Played after a long thing. After the game he said he was also looking at 23....Rxa2 and he showed me some interesting variations, in one he wins my queen for two rooks, but it is probably not winning for him. I think that simply 23....Qxc2 is best followed 24....Rxa2 and black has the advantage.} 24. Qxg6 {I think white is ok now.} Rxb2+ {regaining one of the pawns lost.} 25. Kc1 {Forced!} hxg6 {He takes back.} 26. Rd2 {I have to try and neutralise his Rb2.} Rab8 {And he wants to maintain a rook there.} 27. Rhh2 {Another good defensive move, although I say it myself.} Rb2b1+ {He avoids exchanges.} 28. Kc2 {Forced!} Re1 {Still attacking. 29. R(either) to e2 loses to 29....Rb2+} 29. Bf2 {Attacking his rook.} Rb2+ {Throws in a check.} 30. Kd3 {Forced!} Nc5+ {Another check.} 31. Kc3 {Forced again.} Na4+ {Another check.} 32. Kd3 {With another draw offer. I thought he was going after a repetition.} Nc5+ {But declined.} 33. Kc3 {Forced.} Rxd2 {He takes.} 34. Kxd2 {I take back.} Ra1 {Finally getting his pawn back, but he has no advantage.} 35. Nc2 {Afterwards he praised this move of mine.} Rxa2 {He takes.} 36. Bxc5 {I take.} dxc5 {He takes back.} 37. Re2 {At last this rook is active.} c4 {He pushes his past pawn.} 38. Re7 {I attack.} Ra5 {He counter attacks.} 39. Ne3 {I protect my pawn.} Bh6 {He pins my knight.} 40. Ke2 {I break the pin.} Bxe3 {He takes.} 41. Kxe3 {I take.} Rxd5 {He takes.} 42. Rxc7 {I take.} Rd3+ {He checks.} 43. Ke4 {The surest way to draw.} Rxh3 {He takes.} 44. Rxc4 {I take back.} Kf7 {And drawn on black's suggestion.
