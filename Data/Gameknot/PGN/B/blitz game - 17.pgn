1. e4 {A great blitz game I played recently.} c5 2. f4 a6 3. Nf3 h6 4. c3 {Preparing d4.} d6 5. d4 cxd4 6. cxd4 {10 of the past 11 moves have been pawn moves.} Bg4 7. Be2 Bxf3 8. Bxf3 Qb6 9. O-O {(?) This move loses a pawn.} Nc6 {d5 can't be played because the pawn is pinned. Be3 loses the pawn on b2. Qa4 pins the knight, but the queen takes d4 instead. b3 will force a queen exchange if the queen takes d4. Kh1 doesn't stop the capture. } 10. Nc3 {Instead I developed my knight.} Nxd4 11. Be3 {(?) Loses the pawn on b2} Nxf3+ {gxf3 loses the bishop on e3} 12. Rxf3 Qxb2 13. Rc1 Rc8 14. Bd4 Qb4 {The discovered attack (Bishop on d4) just traded the rooks and queens.I think that Qb4 was a waste of time.} 15. Nd5 {(??) Loses the bishop. I didn't notice that the bishop would be taken on check.} Rxc1 16. Qxc1 Qxd4+ 17. Kh1 Qc5 {Attempting to trade queens. I would have brought out the knight instead.} 18. Rc3 Qxc3 {(??) Why he did that, I have no idea. I thought that he would play Qa5.(Doesn't Qa5 work?)} 19. Qxc3 Kd7 {Mate in 2 that I didn't see:Qc7-->Ke6 Qc8#                                          -->Ke8 Qc8#} 20. f5 {My way still works.} e6 21. Qc7+ Ke8 22. Qc8# {Notice that the bishop, rook and knight never moved once.}
