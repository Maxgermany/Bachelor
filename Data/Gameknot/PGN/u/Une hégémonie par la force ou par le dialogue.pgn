1. e4 {A recent memorable game against a favorite opponent. Bunny obviously heavily favored to win, looking at rating (although we are 2-2 lifetime going into this game).} e5 2. d4 f5 {My first mistake... As white I love playing the opening 1. d4 d5, 2. e4 c5 (little-known fact: this is actually the official opening of my team, the Pawn Stars)so my only guess is here I was laboring under two misconceptions: (1) I'm not playing white, (2) opening was king's pawn not queen's pawn. Oops.} 3. exf5 {Somehow this is not what I was expecting to see...} d5 {...but undaunted, I try to set up my fave opening anyway... } 4. dxe5 {...this is looking worse all the time...} Bxf5 5. Bd3 Ne7 6. Bg5 {Second real mistake, letting my knight get skewered against my queen.} d4 {Third mistake, not even actually seeing it. Still thinking bishop at f5 is covered, I push the d pawn.} 7. Bxf5 {D'ohh.} Qd5 {Here my priority is to release the skewer on the knight, but this will shortly turn out to be not such a bad move for other reasons.} 8. Qh5+ Kd8 {So much for my removing the skewer... now it's a genuine pin. Didn't have a lot of other options though. This is really not how I wanted the board to look at this point.} 9. Bxe7+ Bxe7 10. Bxh7 {More punishment... black is not happy here.} Qxg2 {It's a cliche, but sometimes the best defense really is a good offense. This is one of those times. At this point the rook at h1 is doomed, and there's not a whole lot white can do about it. Some responses are better than others, though.} 11. Be4 {This was not one of the good ones. First real mistake for white.} Qxe4+ 12. Qe2 Qxh1 13. Qf1 Rxh2 14. Nd2 Bh4 {Just throwing everything I have at white to keep the pressure on, but in the meantime, my king's side is in disarray (whatever's left of it is all over the map), meanwhile white is still in a pretty good defensive position and slightly better development.} 15. O-O-O Rxf2 16. Qd3 {White really has to get back on offense to turn this around...} Nc6 17. Qh7 {My king is totally out there exposed and her queen is RIGHT THERE... it's like something out of a horror movie. One of the good ones. But I see a possible quick win with a tempting rook-for-knight trade (17. Rxd2, 18. Rxd2 Qxg1  19. Rd1 Bg5  20. Kb1 Qxd1#. But I could also live with 18. Kxd2 19. Bg5  20. anything Qxh7)} Rxd2 18. Qh8+ {White doesn't seem to like either of those options and instead of taking the bait, goes back on offence... so looks like I got a free knight but otherwise, things look black for black...} Ke7 {Or do they? Not that I have a choice, but I realize at this point if I leave the a8 rook open, and white takes it, white loses...} 19. Qxa8 {O.o... shouldn't have done that, white...} Rxd1+ {...but here, have my other rook too... (white has no choice but to take it)} 20. Kxd1 {The rest is inevitable (probably a few different ways to get to mate from here)} Qxg1+ 21. Kd2 Qe3+ 22. Kd1 Qe1# {}
