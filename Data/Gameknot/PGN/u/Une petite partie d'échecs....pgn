1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Be6 {such passive play makes me sick!} 7. O-O Be7 {The battle here is for central squares, this move doesn't address the issue.  I'd consider directing force against the e5 square with Bd5, C5 later to pressure whites control of this square, and Nc6 with Re8 all keeping the center under lock.  I'm a Tarrasch player, I don't mind an Iso from time to time.} 8. Re1 Nd6 {I'm claustriphobic.} 9. Bf4 O-O 10. Nbd2 h6 11. Rxe6 {Horrible Blunder it seems.  He can throw a few pieces at the king, there's no reason why black can't toss his attack aside and win.  Worst case, navigate through f7 and reposition king on queenside, I'd take the rook after a 2 second think.} fxe6 12. Bxh6 {Not enough. He's looking Ne5 and queen invasion, hitting king and e6 pawn, there is no mate here unless it's handed over. Black has Nf5 stopping both threats, although this leads to a little skewer, giving back the material still leaves black up a piece, some consolidating moves, and it's an easy victory.} gxh6 13. Ne5 Bg5 14. Qg4 Rf6 {Queen protecting the pawn gives more flexibility, and pawn hits the bishop on h-file, queen could help out more than the rook.  And after the pawn move, (with queen protecting) Rook f4 saves the day and the threat is over. Doesn't look best, but even moving the king away might help out a bit more.} 15. h4 Nf7 16. Ndf3 Rf4 17. Qxe6 Qf6 18. Qe8+ {Qc8 picked up b7 and d5, there's no mate here, abondon the idea and secure endgame win. Emotional players, eh? And i think i would've taken the bishop a few moves ago.  I lost a game at the NJ HS championship by postponing to take a piece... I won't do that again, under normal circumstances.} Kg7 19. Ng6 {nice.} Nd6 {Yes, please kick my ass! lol, maybe Re4 or f5, no definitely e4, breathing room for king, block knight protection and try to survive. Black shouldn't be getting whipped like this, he really should've won.} 20. Qh8+ Kf7 21. Qf8+ Ke6 22. Re1+ {NxR looks good, I always look to secure endgame wins, rook move will still be there. Qg8 threatens d5 pawn other knight can come swooping into e5... I'd go for Nxf4.} Ne4 23. Qg8+ Kf5 24. Bxe4+ {NO! NxR so the rook can't support or take the knight afterwards.  The black king looks, trouble...} Rxe4 25. Rxe4 {Queen takes Pawn Check!!} Kxe4 26. Nfe5 {I don't understand this move... Really, why??} Bxh4 27. f3+ {all the force is gone, a few pawn checks leaving pawn weakness for white, i'd take black again now, there's no reason why he can't win.  White still could've won afer a little combo.  1.NxB QxN 2.Qh7 (king moves) Skewer knight and queen} Kxd4 28. c3+ Kc5 29. b4+ Kb5 {hmm} 30. Qxd5+ {Amazing....}
