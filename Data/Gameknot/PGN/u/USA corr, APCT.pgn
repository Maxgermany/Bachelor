1. e4 {APCT Chess ... French Defense, Winawer Variation Pawn Variation without 3.e5  * * * * * * * Each of three games played by Eric and I have opened with 1.e4 with my Black Defenses being this French, and an Accelerated Dragon. His Black was the Ruy Lopez Berlin Variation (3...Nf6 without playing ...a6 there). Each game has been highly interesting to me and theoretical yet displaying new ideas.   I think this game was really quite the clash, both tactical and theoretical. And why shouldn't it be? The WT player is a highly rated otb FM and author of a book on the French Defense that was so important as to overturn the assessment of another BL mainline, making it practically (or more likely "actually unplayable...") unplayable for BL. And BL is a specialist in the French Defense, then at the peak of his game with performance results exceeding 2400 at this point of career, in the French. And BL has a new move begging to be tried, which fortuitously is in the very variation that WT is begging to try! This is a real slugfest of a game, so bear in mind also that it is played at a time when computers were dogs and could not beat a well prepared Class postalite, or likely even survive!  If you are wondering why Eric was Expert at the time, well I do too. Just from the games he and I have played, it is clear he has high Master level knowledge of the game, positionally as well as tactically. (The Sicilican we played makes clear his positional abililty to not only play "the rules" but at a higher level as well, and play the "exceptions".) And is a very aggressive player as well. I suspect that he was giving up some potential rating points in a quest to get into lines he wished to try out, perhaps for publication in his works. I never asked, but that is my theory. And besides that, the game & ratings are from APCT which was a very strong USA organization; probably the strongest if one goes by the results of the 1st National Team Championship where APCT finished a solid first place ahead of USCF, CCLA & others. Anyway, I do hope you enjoy the game!  }8-) Craig  } e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {This was Fischer's main choice against the French ... after he gave up playing the King's Indian Attack formation from early in his Chess career.  } Bb4 {Bb4 signals this is a Winawer Variation (of the French Defense). Most common now, and objectively stongest IMO is 4.e5 which leads me most often into the mainline Poisoned Pawn Var. of 4...c5 (or 4...Ne7) 5.a3 Bxc3  6.bxc3 Ne7 (or ...Qc7 or even ...Nf5 if Ne7 previously played.) then 7.Qg4 and BL would now sac his g & h pawns to play against WT's center pawns immediately instead. If I had the WT pieces that is.       Sometimes I will vary with 4.Nge2 de4 5.a3 line, in which Black can try to hold his extra pawn or else give it back instead and spend his time bolstering his own center, which can then become a good one.       Or I might try the line with 4.e5 c5 5.Bd2 sometime, tho i have not yet done it in a rated corr. game.        The other lines for WT I am not very impressed with, although the one with 4.Qg4 seems solid enough, it is hardly enterprising imo. And Fischers postitional line without Qg4, which plays Nf3 instead, does not suit my abilities nor inclinations well.   } 4. Bd2 dxe4 5. Qg4 Nf6 6. Qxg7 Rg8 7. Qh6 Qxd4 8. O-O-O Rg6 9. Qh4 Rg4 10. Qh3 {The sac of the d and f pawns is "book" and presented before this in Watson's first "Play The French". After his Qh3 it was important to get my Queen off the d-file as well. If I did not get to make a move 10 then he could play the powerful 11.Bg5 which would force material concession from BL by 11...Qxd1+ 12.Kxd1 Rxg5 since the Qe5 retreat drops a Rook: 11...Qe5? 12.Qxg4!! Nxg4?? 13.Rd8#. OUCH~! Inferior to the shocking 12.Qxg4 would be the more routine looking 12.Bxf6 which still leaves my R on g4 hanging again, concurrent with the threat of 13.Rd8#, BUT then BL has the resource of playing Qf4+! 13.Kb1 and following that with Mate defense by use of a minor piece [such as ...Nd7], while his Q keeps guard of his Rook. } Qxf2 11. Be3 Qf5 12. Bb5+ {It seems Eric was hot to try this line too! And indeed it was the very sequence I had been wondering about for WT. Wondering enough that I had come up with my reply before this game even started. } Ke7 {This was my "new move" Ke7. At least I had not seen it played, and haven't actually seen anyone do it since then either! oh well  :) } 13. Rf1 Qg6 14. Nge2 a6 15. Nf4 Rxf4 {Of course} 16. Bxf4 axb5 {Now the Ra8 develops incidentally but very usefully, creating an 'avenue-of-attack' on the a-file which soon becomes a highway. This eventuality is one reason why ...a6 was chosen over ...c6 on move 14. Other considerations would have been that ...c6 would have bolstered d5, but also weakened d6 & that dark diagonal thru b8; also that ...a6 left open an option to develop Nc6 (rather than Nbd7) if desired, which would have made ...e5 , unveiling the Bc8 attack upon WT's Qh3 , a powerful immediate threat. } 17. Nxb5 {Another benefit of the move 12... Ke7 being seen now; that Nxc7 is much less fearsome to behold than if the King were still on e8, facing a potential incoming N-fork-check of K & R.  } Rxa2 18. Kb1 Ra5 19. Nxc7 Nc6 20. Bg3 {WT wants to resume pressure upon the Nf6 by re-establishing a pin with Bh4. BL carefully considered his potential danger from that plan before deciding to play the active placement 19...Nc6, since it cedes the added protection that Nbd7 could have offered to the Nf6. Given the choice however, it is my nature & style to choose counter-attack over defense whenever feasible. Certainly, if one is going to shy from playing sharply, they should probably choose a less double-edged opening than the FRENCH DEFENSE! Perhaps the Sicilian !?  ~Wink/LOL~ ...  };-D)} Nd4 21. Bh4 Rf5 22. Qe3 Qxg2 23. Rfc1 Nf3 {...Nf3 threatens 24 ... Nd2+ 25.Ka2 Ra5+ 26.Qa3 winning WT's Queen, etc} 24. Bxf6+ Rxf6 25. Rhd1 Nd2+ 26. Ka2 Rf5 27. b3 Ra5+ 28. Kb2 Ba3+ 29. Kc3 Rc5+ {WT Resigns or 30.Kd4 e5# threat would have forced a sac here of 30.QxRc5 Bxc5 and 31.Rxd2? would be a blunder that after Bb4+ gives up both Rooks if 32.KxBb4 Qxd2+ and that might just be the best King move! :)  Insofar as the game, I doubt either of us looked much at playing those particulars, and would not have thought to insult the other or mar a well fought game, by playing thru hopeless lines from the weaker side, whoever had it in a particular game. Win or lose, it really only takes one struggle like this to develop a healthy respect for that opponent, as I have for FM Schiller. A very pleasing matchup to participate in, in all respects. Thanks for a fabulous contest Eric~! }
