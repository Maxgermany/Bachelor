1. e4 d5 {The Center Counter defense and if white is not greedy and developes normally, he should maintain an advantage.} 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. f3 Bf5 5. g4 {Now the problems for white seem to be starting. Better is Bb4+ and prepare to castle king-side.} Bg6 6. c4 {A player of this rating should reject any plan that makes his pawn structure look like this.} e6 7. Nc3 exd5 8. g5 Nfd7 9. Nxd5 Nc6 10. Bf4 {Not good. Black can exchange this bishop off and have three developed pieces against one, and have a better pawn structure but still a pawn down.} Bd6 11. Bxd6 cxd6 12. h4 {There is a lot of undefended room behind white's pieces.} Nb6 13. Nxb6 Qxb6 14. d5 {Weakening his position even further.} Nb4 15. Qa4+ Kf8 16. Ne2 {Clearly the losing move brought about by the undended squares deep in the white position.} Nc2+ 17. Kd2 Qe3+ {Qe3+! Resignable now because of the material loss that can't be avoided.} 18. Kd1 Qxf3 19. Rg1 Qd3+ 20. Kc1 Nxa1 21. Nf4 {Nf4? loses on the spot. Nothing but undefended pieces scattered about.} Qe3+ {This defense held because of poor play by white and can't be considered the best response to e4.}
