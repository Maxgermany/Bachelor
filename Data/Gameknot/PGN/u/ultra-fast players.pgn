1. e4 {I feel that this is one of the best games I have played. Articulator probably just underestimated me. If someone sees something that I did not, feel free to comment. } d5 {At this point he is trying to gain control of the center of the board. } 2. e5 {So I move my king pawn to e5, something I hate having done to me. } a6 3. d4 e6 4. a3 Ne7 5. Nc3 Nbc6 6. Qg4 {Probably not the best move move. I should have developed my king,knight or queen,bishop. } b6 7. Bd3 Bb7 8. Be3 Qd7 9. Nf3 h6 10. O-O O-O-O {Was not expecting a queen side castle. } 11. Nd2 { } g5 12. b4 {Applying pawn pressure to break up the wall of pieces he has built in front of his King.} b5 13. a4 {Maybe not the best move, but I want to keep applying pressure. I do not want him to finish developing his pieces for an attack, instead I want to be the one applying pressure. } Nxb4 14. axb5 axb5 15. Bxb5 c6 {Nice defensive move, but I have already started to break down his defence. } 16. Ba4 {I had to retreat my bishop to keep his knight from capturing c2.} Ng6 17. Nb3 Be7 18. Nc5 {I move Nc5 to lure e7 bishop.} Bxc5 {It worked. } 19. dxc5 Nxe5 20. Qxb4 Nc4 21. Nb5 {At this point I feel I have enough piece to push my attack. So I sacrifice my knight to open things up. I played this out many times and feel that this is what needed done to decapitate his King.} cxb5 22. Bxb5 Qc7 23. c6 Bxc6 24. Bxc6 Qxc6 25. Rfb1 Kd7 {Got him on the run. } 26. Ra7+ {He can't stop what is coming, but only prolong it.  } Ke8 27. Qe7# {}
