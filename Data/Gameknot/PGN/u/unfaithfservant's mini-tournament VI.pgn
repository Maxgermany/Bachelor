1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 {The initial phase of Morra's Gambit. The idea is to mobilize the pieces quickly to good squares and to get Black out of book and make uncoordinated moves--which usually happens. A pawn is sacrificed to do this however.} Nc6 5. Bc4 e6 6. Nf3 Bb4 {Bb4? This bishop is needed for defense and not put into a position for trading for White's weak bishop, or worse, the knight on c3.} 7. O-O Nge7 8. Bf4 a6 9. Bd6 {Bd6! Already pressuring  Black's poor set-up. } Bxc3 10. bxc3 {Leaving the very strong bishop at d6 and trading his strongest piece.} b5 11. Bb3 Na5 12. Qd3 Nxb3 13. axb3 {Not even an isolated pawn anymore for compensation. These pawns are strong and the rook is now activated--but the queenside is not where I'm going to be.} Bb7 14. Rfd1 {The d file can't be contested now. His dark squares are very weak because of the missing bishop.} Bc6 15. Ne5 f6 16. Nxc6 Nxc6 17. Qg3 Kf7 {What else?  White has an unusual advantage for being a pawn down, but something has to be done immediately with it.} 18. Rd3 e5 19. Rad1 Ra7 20. Bc5 Rb7 21. Qg4 Nb8 22. Qh5+ g6 23. Qh6 Qc8 24. Bd6 Nc6 {I'm thinking of tripling up on the d file with the queen but a continuation I looked at had me not only losing the advantage but the game as well! The exchanges led to Black queening a pawn with his knight protecting it.} 25. f4 {f4! to start busting up that weak king on the f file.} Qe8 26. f5 a5 27. Bc5 b4 {b4? There is no time for that.} 28. Rd3d6 {This didn't trigger any worries for Black so perhaps another won pawn will help...} bxc3 29. Rxf6+ {Rxd6!! A shot. The king is undefended and I'm also being pressured on the queen-side so this move became very necessary.} Kxf6 30. fxg6 {Black resigned here because of the coming mate threat or material loss. fxg6,..hxg6, Rf1+,..Ke6, Qg7!  Black couldn't move properly after 9)...Bxc3 due to his dark- squared weaknesses.} hxg6 31. Rf1+ Ke6 32. Qg7 Rf8 33. Rxf8 {}
