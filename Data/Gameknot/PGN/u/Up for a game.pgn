1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 {All book up to here.} 5. Ng5 {Committed now. This Knight has no retreat after my next move.} h6 6. Nxf7 {Getting something for the "desperado" Knight.} Kxf7 7. Bc4+ d5 8. Bxd5+ Kg7 {K-K1 may have been better. Now my King is exposed and blocking my K-side pieces.} 9. Bxb7 {To allow his next move after I capture the B.} Bxb7 10. Qxg4+ Kf7 {I don't want to corner my K with K-R2.} 11. Qxf4+ Kg7 {K-K3 was probably better.

Qf6+ {Closing the ring.} Kh7 {The other move is equally bad. } 18. Qg7# {End of game. Well done by my opponent.}
