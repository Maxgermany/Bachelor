[Opening "French defence, Steiner variation (C00)"]

1. e4 {This game is interesting in that white is virtually forced to under-promote. After being under pressure for most of the game black comes up with a saving resource.} e6 {This is the French Defence. I normally play the Sicilian Defence, but sometimes play this against stronger opponents. The problem with playing this against weaker players is that the exchange variation is very drawish ((2. d4 d5 3. exd)} 2. c4 {But what is this! Normally d4 is played and I am also familiar with moves like Qe2, d3, g3, Ne2. I was rather thrown by this.} Nc6 {Perhaps I should have just played d5} 3. Nf3 e5 {This is the only move on the Gameknot world opening database, but it may be bad just to lose a tempo in playing e6 followed by e5} 4. Nc3 Bc5 {Black is a move down compared to normal lines} 5. Nxe5 {and this little combination gives white a strong centre} Nxe5 6. d4 Bd6 7. c5 Be7 8. dxe5 Bxc5 {White's doubled e pawns are actually quite strong. The black knight is denied the best square of f6} 9. Bc4 Ne7 10. O-O O-O 11. Na4 {And now it looks like I have to let my best piece be exchanged} d6 12. Nxc5 dxc5 {So now we have an interesting pawn formation. Both sides have doubled pawns. I was rather hoping for an end game where my queen side pawn majority may be an advantage. But first there is the middle game and the problem of how to complete my development.} 13. Be3 b6 14. Qb3 {And now the natural Bb7 is met by Bxc5! winning a pawn, so I had to come up with something else.} Nc6 15. e6 fxe6 16. Bxe6+ Kh8 {Of course, I would love to exchange my under-developed bishop, but 16... Bxe6, 17. Qxe6ch and my knight drops} 17. Rad1 {Developing with tempo} Qf6 18. Bxc8 Raxc8 19. f4 Rce8 20. e5 Qg6 21. Qd3 Red8 22. Qxg6 hxg6 {I was rather relieved to get the queens off. I thought it would be hard for white to attack my weak doubled g pawns.} 23. h4 Nd4 24. Rd2 Nf5 25. Kf2 Nd4 26. g4 Rd5 27. Kg2 c6 28. b4 Ne6 29. bxc5 Rxd2+ 30. Bxd2 Nxc5 31. Bb4 Rd8 32. Bxc5 bxc5 33. Rc1 {Now all my 5 pawns are isolated and 4 of them are doubled!} Rd2+ 34. Kf3 Rxa2 35. e6 Kg8 36. Rxc5 Kf8 37. Rxc6 Ke7 38. f5 gxf5 39. gxf5 {I thought I may lose this.....} Ra3+ 40. Kg4 Kf6 41. Rc8 Ra4+ 42. Kh5 Kxf5 43. e7 g6+ 44. Kh6 Kf6 {Now I am threatening mate, so white is forced to underpromote the pawn, or just lose it.} 45. e8=N+ {Now if white could hang on the h pawn he is winning, but as soon as I get rid of it, it is a drawn ending. Let's not hang about in going after it!} Kf5 46. Nd6+ Kg4 47. Kxg6 Kxh4 {Draw agreed.}
