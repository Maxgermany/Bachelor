1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 {Ah, the King's Gambit.  And in this line white develops while black futzes around with his pawns, making kingside weaknesses. } 4. Bc4 g4 5. O-O {This is why I posted this.  It just tickles me pink.  A pawn for a knight.  A second pawn is coming, but this just went from a gambit to a GAMBIT.  } gxf3 6. Qxf3 Qe7 7. d4 {Because it's the bishop that's meant to re-capture the advanced f pawn, naturally.  } Nc6 8. c3 Ne5 {An interesting idea.  Black offers the choice of regaining the material with the cost of both a pawn and the sweet center structure while gaining an isolani OR losing the powerful white-square bishop.  } 9. Qe2 Nxc4 {And Zukertort chooses strong pawns.  } 10. Qxc4 c6 11. Bxf4 Qxe4 {While I can understand wanting to do some damage to white's center, this is emphatically NOT the piece to do it with at this time.  } 12. Bg3 {Secures the bishop, freeing the rook, threatening the pin... Oh, and threatens Qxb7.  Still, better is Nd2.  } Qd5 {And a multi-purpose attacking move deserves a multi-purpose defensive move.} 13. Re1+ {Wow.  I bet you didn't see that one coming.  } Ne7 14. Qe2 Kd8 {Trying to run away?  But how's that gonna happen without d6?  So why not d6 now?  } 15. Bh4 Qd6 {What else is there?  Not much.  } 16. Na3 {A knight on the rim... is about to open up a can of woop-a$$.} b5 17. Rad1 {Ok, let's take stock.  White has four thousand pieces pointed at e7.  They're mostly coordinating well.  He has two pawn islands and he's down a whole piece.  Black has a piece and an awkward position.  All the force on e7 guarantees that the king can't be extracted without losing that piece.  Not fun for Black.  } Bb7 18. Rd3 f6 {Black's trying to do what he can to get breathing room and to develop the rest of his pieces.  One can't fault him for trying -- but Zukertort has it all covered.} 19. Rf3 Bg7 {...removing one of the defenders of e7, but there's one less attacker.  However, that blocked attacker can do more elsewhere.  } 20. Bg3 Qe6 21. Re3 {Ugh.  } Qf7 22. Rxe7 Qg6 23. Nxb5 {Saccing the knight to get the Queen into a position from which she can mate.  } Ba6 {And Black wants none of that.} 24. Rxd7+ {But there are just too many ways for black to die.  The g3 bishop holds c7 and that makes the rook sac possible -- king gets mated on c8.  }
