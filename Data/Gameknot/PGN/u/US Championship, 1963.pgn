1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 {On tour in 1964, I experimented with 5 N-B5. If then 5... Q-B2 6 B-Q3 BxB 7 NxB P-K3, White has more space, and the Knight discourages ...P-QB4 or ...P-K4.} Bg6 6. Nf3 Nf6 {More usual is the immediate... N-Q2 to prevent N-K5.} 7. h4 h6 8. Bd3 {White can try to exploit Black's move order by 8 N-K5, but 8... B-R2 9 B-QB4 P-K3 10 Q-K2 N-Q4! (followed by ...N-Q2) equalizes.} Bxd3 9. Qxd3 e6 10. Bd2 Nbd7 {10... Q-B2 11 P-B4 N/1-Q2 12 B-B3 P-QR4! equalizes.} 11. O-O-O Qc7 12. c4 O-O-O {12... B-Q3! 13 B-K4 B-B5! simplifies.} 13. Bc3 {Now Black can no longer force the exchange of Bishops.} Qf4+ {The start of a faulty concept. 13.. B-Q3 14 N-K4 B-B5 ch 15 K-N1 N-K4! 16 NxN BxN equalizes.} 14. Kb1 Nc5 {He still has time to back out with 14... Q-B2.} 15. Qc2 Nce4 {Now there is no turning back.} 16. Ne5 {A clear refutation. The Queen's retreat is cut off and the weakness on Black's KB2 etched sharply.} Nxf2 {What else? } 17. Rdf1 {Probably what Steinmeyer overlooked when he went into this whole mess. On 17...QxN 18 RxN Q-K6 (else 19 R-B3 winning the Q) 19 R-K2 Q-B5 20 NxKBP wins at least the exchange. So Black resigns. [Fischer, on the tournament as a whole] Motivated by my lopsided result (11-0), Dr. Hans Kmoch congratulated the runner-up, Evans, on "winning" the tournament... and then he congratulated me on "winning the exhibition."}
