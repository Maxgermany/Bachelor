1. e4 e5 {Game in the centre.} 2. Nf3 f6 {Typical Damiano's defence opening by black.} 3. Nxe5 {Firstly this looks like a blunder, but just in a second white's intention becomes much more clearer.} fxe5 {Black goes for the knight, but opens widely his kingside white diagonal.} 4. Qh5+ {Here comes trouble...} g6 {No much choice left to black to deffend here. The rook is already out of the game:(} 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8 Nf6 {Let's try to trap this queen...} 7. d3 {Good move by white covering the center pawn.} d5 {Keeping the presure in the center.} 8. Bh6 {White wants to get his queen whole out of the corner.} Nbd7 {Developing move which covers important positions in the center.} 9. Nc3 {The black center is attacked.} c6 {...and covered.} 10. O-O-O {White decides to castle Queenside.} Ng4 {The queen is free to flee, but black wants at least the bishop in return for the given rook.} 11. Qd4 Bxh6+ {And black gets it with a chess.} 12. Kb1 Bg7 {Back to the queen.} 13. e5 {Way too many black pieces are pointed on this sqare for white to hope covering it with this move.} Ndxe5 14. Re1 {Not a bad move by white endangering the e file with the King's family and escaping the knight's fork.} Be6 {Covering and opening for castling.} 15. Qf4 {I personally do not see much sense in this move by white.} O-O-O 16. h3 {This makes more sense, although it comes a bit late.} Rf8 {The Queen is forced to move again.} 17. Qa4 {...and there is a slight danger...} Nxf2 {Let's firstly attack:)} 18. Rg1 b5 {Danger eleminated at least temporary.} 19. Qa6+ Kb8 20. d4 {White attacks in the center.} Nxh3 {One of black's knights has to be sacrificed and black decides to set a small trap.} 21. Rh1 {White sees it and moves the rook.} Ng5 {Black retreats covering the h-pawn.} 22. dxe5 {Black seems to be in trouble again.} Bd7 23. Re3 {Blunder?} d4 24. Nd5 {Or not?} Qc5 {Good move by black.} 25. b4 Qxd5 26. Ra3 {White sees a possibility for a quick finish...} Qxe5 27. Qxa7+ {Really...?} Kc8 28. Qa8+ Kc7 29. Ra7+ Kd6 {Or not quite...} 30. Qb7 Qe1+ {Here comes the Queen.} 31. Kb2 d3+ {And the bishop too:)}
