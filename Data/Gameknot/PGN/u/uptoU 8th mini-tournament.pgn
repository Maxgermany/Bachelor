1. d4 {This was an interesting game against a strong opponent. I was very on my attack, so the opponent managed to get advantage.  I tried desperately for a hasted counterattack, which fortunately helped me save at least half a point.  } d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c3 Bf5 4. Bf4 c6 5. Nbd2 h6 6. e3 e6 7. Be2 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Ne5 Nbd7 10. Nxd7 Qxd7 11. Nf3 c5 12. Ne5 Qc8 13. g4 Bh7 14. Bg3 Ne4 15. f4 f6 16. Nd3 c4 17. Nf2 Nxg3 18. hxg3 b5 {White will attack from King's side while black from Queen's. } 19. a3 a5 20. Bf3 Qd7 21. Kg2 b4 22. e4 bxc3 23. bxc3 Rab8 24. exd5 exd5 25. Qd2 Rb3 26. a4 Rfb8 27. f5 h5 {I think that this move somehow unnecessary for black.} 28. Rae1 hxg4 29. Bxg4 Bf8 30. Re6 Qxa4 31. Qe3 Qd7 32. Re1 a4 33. Nh3 a3 34. Ng5 {Here, I was determined that a passive defence would lead in lose. This move is risky, and maybe look like a blunder, but I think it is my only hope. Any other move looked too slow for my attack.} fxg5 {The opponent accepted the sacrifice, but I managed to weaken his defence.} 35. Qxg5 a2 {Black is better here, but white has some counter attack. Qf7 looks more safe.} 36. f6 Rb3b1 37. Re6e7 {Last chance, hoping my opponent will not find the best way to defend.} Qxe7 {Maybe ...Rxe1 was better} 38. Rxe7 Rb8b2+ {This is a bad move. White manages draw with perpetual checks.  Rg1ï¼‹ would be the best.} 39. Be2 {Only move.} Rxe2+ 40. Rxe2 a1=Q 41. Qxd5+ Kh8 42. fxg7+ Kxg7 43. Qe5+ Kg8 44. Qe6+ Kg7 45. Qe5+ Kg8 46. Qe6+ {Draw. I enjoyed this game a lot. I did many mistakes, but somehow I feel happy because I tried to counterattack and not just do passive defence. Maybe I could have lost very easy if my opponent was a bit more cool, but in any case I managed a draw. This is a game to show that sometimes, it worths to take risks, especially when losing.}
