1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {A common King's pawn opening.} Nd4 {Here black enters a gambit I have never faced before, which is quite bad if white declines. If white takes the knight, black wins only 26% of the time.} 4. Nxe5 {I took the pawn hastily, only glancing at possible threats.} Qg5 {I saw this move before, but didn't realize that the g-pawn would be under attack. I now thought for much longer than usual, but alas, black has forced win of material or mate.} 5. Ng4 {This is the best I could come up with. Taking on f7 is disastrous after 5. ... Qxg2 6. Rf1 Qxe4+ 7. Be2 Nf3#. Immediate mate could be avoided, but only by sacrificing a lot of material. Another option was Bxf7+, but then my bishop and knight are in danger.} d5 {This was the expected response, white must still give up the piece.} 6. Be2 {I decided not to take the pawn, but instead to try and relieve pressure.} h5 {This was a big mistake, he should have taken immediately with the LSB.} 7. d3 {I threaten the queen while simultaneously opening a line for my DSB.} Qg6 {Probably the best response. This keeps pressure on g2 and threatens to win a pawn on e4, but then looking at my response makes me think this move was not so great.} 8. Ne5 {Again I am trying to relieve the pressure on my position. Notice that I have the bishop on e2 ready for defense, which I did not have on move 4. I am eyeing 8. ... Qxg2 9. Bf3 Nxf3+ 10. Qxf3 Qxf3 11. Nxf3 dxe4 12. dxe4 Bg4 13. Ne5 etc. which is exactly what happened.} Qxg2 9. Bf3 Nxf3+ 10. Qxf3 Qxf3 11. Nxf3 dxe4 12. dxe4 Bg4 13. Ne5 O-O-O {My opponent has the better position here, but I have relieved a great amount of pressure, which is what I wanted. Notice that my opponent is threatening Rd1#.} 14. Nxg4 {There's no point to maintaining the threat of a fork on f7, because after 14. f3 Be6 it is defended and my opponent has a potentially powerful bishop pair.} hxg4 {Now I try to develope my pieces, and make some threats of my own.} 15. Nc3 Bb4 16. Bd2 {Breaking the pin, and getting ready to castle long.} c6 17. O-O-O Nf6 {I am now in a much better position than I was in the beginning, white has made great progress, and has good winning chances.} 18. Bg5 {I don't know what I was thinking here, this just wrecks my pawn structure and makes my pawns some easy endgame targets.} Bxc3 {And now for the worst move I have ever made.} 19. b3 {Now all in a fraction of a second, I pick up my pawn and move it to take the bishop, but wait, I accidentally moved to the wrong square. It's good thing that it's correspondance chess because I can just fix it, but look at that! I've already hit submit! What followed was some desperate attempt to close the window or otherwise stop the submission, but I think you can guess how that turned out.} Rxd1+ {Now I resign in utter disgust, perhaps it wasn't technically the worst move I've ever made, but it was definitely the most damaging to my ego. I guess the lesson here is that you should always check twice, because taking those few extra seconds won't kill you, but not doing so could.  P.S. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone else can truthfully say that they have done this before, or that they have seen someone do it. It might just make me feel better. :( Also, look at another one of my annotations to see something I'm actuall proud of, particularly 'A Tactical Save'.}
