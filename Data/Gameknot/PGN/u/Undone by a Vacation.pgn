[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence"]

1. e4 {A mini-tournament game, I'm white and begin with the Open Game.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez. I get to attack!} d6 4. O-O {Black played the Old Steinitz defense, known for its cramped but solid positions. I have an old book, by Leonard Barden called The Ruy Lopez, Winning Chess with 1P-K4. It's one of only two opening books I own. It offers only a very brief analysis in passing, but it says the Old Steinitz is passive and fallen into disfavor, and "it is most forcefully countered by white's maintaining the option of castling on either wing" - well, I already blew that, didn't I? The book says 4. d4 and 5. Nc3 are called for. Of course, much may have changed in 46 years, since the GK DB seems to believe the move as played is a strong choice.} Nf6 5. d3 {Can't trap the LSB behind the white pawns, so 5. d3 does an excellent job of defending e4.} a6 6. Bxc6+ bxc6 7. d4 {Until this loss of tempo, that is. But 5. ... a6 changed everything in the center, so it seems prudent to challenge that center. White ould love nothing more than to play dxe4 and isolate black's doubled pawns on the c-file, though I'm sure black won't allow that. And the pawn on e4 is safe enough with no defenders.} exd4 8. Qxd4 {An active queen. I love that. Put her in the center and watch her work. It's nice when she's safe from attack, too.} c5 9. Qd3 {Ok, now she's safe.} Be7 10. Nc3 O-O 11. Re1 Bg4 12. e5 {Not a good idea for black to take the pawn on e4, isolating his c-pawns.} Nd7 13. exd6 {Now white's rook seizes an open file without even moving. Lazy rook.} cxd6 14. Bf4 {two-on-one attacking the pawn on d6.} Nf6 15. Ng5 {This move makes many threats. The obvious checkmate on h7, though that is currently defended. The threat of 16. Ne4 putting three-on-two attacking d6. and it also allows for 16. Nd5 which forks black's knight and bishop. A triple threat.} Bh5 16. Nd5 {White decides to start with the fork. Of course, black cannot capture 16. ... Nxd5??? because that knight is needed to defend h7. Black is actually in a world of hurt because of 15. ... Bh5?. His other bishop on e7 is attacked twice and needs a defender, but if 16. ... Re8, 17. Nxf6+ Bxf6 (or gxf6) 18. Qxh7+ Kf8 19. Qh8#. Better is 16. ... Bg3, threatening white's queen, but 17. Nxe7+ wins a piece for white. However, black postponed his games and took some vacation time, leaving me in suspense for many days while he was gone.} Nxd5 17. Qxh7# {My guess is that black came back and had a whole long queue full of games awaiting his moves. This move, 16. Nxd5??? sure looks like it was rushed. In any case, it was the one move black couldn't make, but he did. I'll blame his vacation for distracting him.}
