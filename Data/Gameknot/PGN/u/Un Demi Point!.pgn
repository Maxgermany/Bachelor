1. e4 {Hi everyone!  As I said at the end of my last annotation.  Now for the good news!  This game starts off as a Scotch Opening.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {3. d4 - this move characterises the Scotch Opening - it challenges the centre and interesting play results.  Just for the benefit of newcomers to the annotations gallery, my first ever game with Coach Ion which I annotated as Battle of the Wings started off as a Scotch.  White deviates to a Goring Gambit on his next move.} exd4 4. c3 dxc3 {4. ........ dxc3 - I accept this gambit with some trepidation as when I looked in the database the first thing I saw was the Sea Cadet Mate.  That mate is similar to Legal's Mate.  However, playing through that game I made myself a mental aide memoir.  Do not play Bg4!} 5. Bc4 d6 6. O-O Nf6 7. Qb3 Qd7 {7. ......... Qd7 - to defend the weak f7 pawn.} 8. Ng5 Ne5 9. Bb5 c6 {9. ........ c6 - to screen out that lsb's attack on Glenda.} 10. f4 cxb5 11. fxe5 dxe5 12. Nxc3 {12. Nxc3 - after an exchange of white's lsb for my knight white finally collects my c3 pawn.  I now gain a vital developmental tempo for Frere Lenoir with Bc5 } Bc5+ 13. Kh1 O-O 14. Nxb5 {14. Nxb5 - I decided to let the b pawn go in order to tuck Henry away on the kingside and to bring another defender to the weak pawn on f7 which is pinned against Henry.  Somehow I must drive the Wicked Witch of the West off the a2-g8 diagonal.} Qc6 {14. ........ Qc6 - opens up Frere Leblanc's diagonal.  My next move h6 prepares the possibility of putting Fere Leblanc on e6 developing my bishop, connecting my rooks and driving the Witch off that diagonal unpinning the f7 pawn by driving back the white knight.} 15. Nc3 h6 16. Nf3 Re8 {16. ......... Re8 - backing up my e pawn.} 17. Bd2 Qb6 {17. ....... Qb6 - here I froze.  This was the first time that I had managed to maintain a clear pawn lead against an Expert.  There seemed to be no weaknesses, but this just seemed too good to be true.  I let the emotional baggage from my past performances against the Expert colour my judgement here.  I offered Jim a draw.  I half expected a refusal.  If the refusal was to come with an exchange of queens I would recapture with Frere Lenoir, otherwise Frere Leblanc would come to e6 and drive back the Witch followed by the move Ne7 to protect my e pawn and to prepare f6 to bolster it.  But he accepted the draw offer and I received 7.1 points for this high draw.  At the end of the game Ion assessed the position as Black has a clear advantage.  I suppose in one way I am in a win win situation here.  If the advantage is with white then it was a good draw offer.  If it was a bad draw offer then it is nice to end the game with the better of things against a player 300 points north of my rating.  In any case it ensured that although I came bottom of the league I did not leave Beafyness' tourney with nul point.  It was Un Demi Point.    My opponent had the following to add - hope you can follow:-  1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.c3 [4.Nxd4 Bc5 5.Nxc6 Qf6= ]   4...dxc3 5.Bc4 [5.Nxc3 Nf6= ]   5...d6 I have always thought this best   6.0-0 Nf6 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Ng5 Ne5 9.Bb5 [>=9.Nxc3!? is interesting 9...h6 10.Nf3=/  ]   9...c6-/  10.f4 cxb5 11.fxe5 dxe5 12.Nxc3 Dunno whether Be3 is better?  12….Bc5  13.Kh1 0-0 14.Nxb5 [14.Nd5!?
