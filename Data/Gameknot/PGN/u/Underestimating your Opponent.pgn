1. e4 {During this game I underestimated the power of my opponent's king because I allowed her to do whatever she wanted, when she wanted, with her king.  She only had the king and a pawn, but I had the king, two pawns, and a knight, so I was about to get a pawn promotion.  However, I messed up, somehow.  Therefore, my opponent ended up with more pieces then I had, and she also got something that I had lost, a pawn promotion.  Therefore, I was forced to resign from the game.} c5 { This was her, "cornerstone" of the Sicilian defense.} 2. Nc3 {For me, it might have been better if I had played Nf3, on this move, instead.  This might have then given me the opportunity to play Bc4 by move 3 and castle by move 4.} Nf6 3. Nf3 {This was the move that I was referring to 2. Nc3.  Instead, I did on my third move for the exact same reason with Bc4 and then castling.} d6 {Now, she decides to play the Sicilian defense.  In the mean time, I bring out my knights so that I am protected.} 4. Bc4 {I brought out my bishop so that I could castle on my next move, but I was unaware that this would be a bad time to castle.  I also realize that Bc4 was a bad move because she could have played a fork against me between my pawn on e4 and my bishop on c4.  Luckily, she does not do this but instead, she plays Nc6.} Nc6 5. O-O {As I mentioned earlier, this was a bad to castle.  I should have played Ng5 because she is going to bring out her bishop on her next move and threaten my knight with Bxf3.} Bg4 {Not only does she play Bg4 and threaten with Bxf3, but I am now pinned.  That is I cannot pull my knight away with Ng5, or I am going to loose my queen because she is going to play Bxd1.} 6. Bb5 {On the other hand, I play Bb5 because I am thinking, "Two could play that game".  That is because I decided to pin her, in return, with Bb5. } e5 7. Bxc6+ {I figured that I would exchange my bishop with her pawn.  That way, she will have two bad pawns because two of her pawns will be on the c square, but that does not happen.} Bd7 {Now, she makes a big mistake that allows me to get a free bishop and check her.} 8. Bxd7+ {Now she lost a pawn and is checked after I play Bxd7+, and I am just getting started. } Qxd7 {Even though she captures my bishop with Qxd7, I still have a few surprises for her.} 9. Nd5 {I try to force an exchange with her, with Nxd5 and exd5 by playing Nd5, but that plan also does not work.  } Ng4 {Instead, she moves her knight away from danger, with Ng4.} 10. b3 {I do not know what I was thinking, but b3 was not a great move because she threatens the knight with Qxe6 on her next move.  This move did not make a lot of sense.  I wanted to bring out my bishop and form a Fianchetto because I would not be able to capture free pieces or exchange them, in this position.} Qe6 {I do not understand why she played Qe6 because I ask myself the following.  What piece is she threatening?  I am looking at the entire board, and the queen does not seem like a threat, at the moment.} 11. Nc7+ {At this point, I decide to play a 3 way fork against her in order to capture her queen since she is checked.} Ke7 12. Nxe6 {This was my favorite capture of the game.  } fxe6 13. Bb2 {Now, I decide to play a Fianchetto with Bb2.  I learned, a few years ago, that it is generally good if one could do this.} h5 {I am not sure why she played h5, but I believe that she did it to either capture a free a pawn or get a pass pawn.} 14. Qe2 {I played Qe2 in order to prevent her from capturing a free pawn with Qxc4.   } g6 15. h3 {I played h3 to threaten her knight with hxg4.} Nf6 16. Rad1 {I learned, several years ago, that one is eventually supposed to connect the rooks during the game.  That is why I played Rad1.} h4 17. g3 {I forced an exchange with this move because I generally like to exchange pieces.} hxg3 18. fxg3 Rxh3 {However, this was not a good exchange because it was not even.  At the point, I did not realize that I supposed to count pieces.  This is something that Jack Stockel taught me, about 5 weeks ago.  Because I did not count the pieces, she was able to get an extra pawn during the exchange.} 19. Kg2 {In this position, her rook is now threatened with Kxh3, so she is now forced to pull her rook back.} Rh5 20. Rfh1 {I made this move so that I could force an exchange with her with Rxh7, but this does not happen.} Bh6 {Instead she brings her bishop.  I believe that it is because she was trying to trick me, but I was not going to be fooled.} 21. Rxh5 {I still force the exchange.} Nxh5 22. Kh2 {I played Kh2 in order to put pressure on her knight.  } Rh8 {On the other hand, she played Rh8 in to put pressure on the h square.} 23. Qf2 {I played Qf2 to put pressure on her.} g5 24. g4 {I decided to threaten her with gxh5 by playing g4.  As a result, she was forced to pull her knight back.} Nf4 25. Ba3 {I do not want know why, I made this move, but it was not strategically smart because it will trigger a negative chain of events.} Bg7+ {At this points, she plays a discover check against me by moving her bishop away from her rook.} 26. Kg1 {This was not a good move.  I should have played Kg3 because she is going to check me in a horrible way.} Nh3+ {Now, she checks and plays a fork against, so she is going to capture my queen, for her knight, with Nxf2.} 27. Kg2 Nxf2 28. Kxf2 Rf8 {Again, she plays Rf8 in order to put pressure on the f square.} 29. Kg3 {This was not a good move.  Instead, I should have played Nxg5 because it would have allowed me to get a free pawn from her.} Bh6 {At this point, she protects her pawn with her bishop.} 30. b4 {I attempted to force an exchange by playing b4, but it did not work.  } Rc8 {Instead, she pressures the c square with her rook.} 31. Rh1 {I respond with Rh1, so that I could threaten her bishop with Rxh6.} Rh8 {As a result, she is forced to protect her bishop with Rh8.} 32. bxc5 {Instead, I force an exchange with her, with bxc5.} dxc5 {This exchange works because I am able to capture an extra, but this capture is a free pawn that leads to a direct check with Bxc5+.} 33. Bxc5+ {Now that she is checked, what happens after she gets out of it?  That will be answered on my next move. } Kf6 34. Bxa7 {I simply capture a free pawn, after she recovers, with Bxa7.} Bg7 {I do not know why she picked this candidate.} 35. Bc5 {This was not a good move.} Rd8 {That is because she could have captured my free rook with rxh1.  It was just lucky that she did not play rxh1. Now instead, she threatens me with Rxd2 by playing Rd8. } 36. Rd1 {Instead, I handle this situation with Rd1, but it is bad move.} Rc8 {That is because she threatens to capture my free bishop with Rxc5.  } 37. Bd6 {I stop the threat by playing Bd6 and forcing her to exchange pawns which will culminate in a serious check.     } Rxc2 38. Bxe5+ {This check forced her to exchange her bishop, and I got a free pawn after that.  } Kg6 39. Bxg7 Kxg7 40. Nxg5 {In addition, I threaten to capture another pawn with Nxg5.} e5 {At this point, she plays e5 because she is forced to protect that pawn.} 41. Ne6+ {I decided to check her with Ne6+, but this does not do much because the check is a mere nuisance but not serious.} Kf7 42. Nd8+ {After she threatens to play kxe6, I respond by checking her again with my knight.  However, this check is serious because I force an exchange with Rxb7 and Rxa2. } Ke7 43. Nxb7 Rxa2 44. g5 {In my attempt to get a pawn promotion, I play g5 as my candidate.} Ra8 {In her attempt to stop the pass pawn and prevent the pawn promotion, she plays Ra8.} 45. Rb1 {I played Rb8 in order to put pressure on the b square.} Rg8 {She plays Rg8 because wants to get a free pawn.} 46. Kg4 {I respond and protect the pawn by playing Kg4.} Rf8 {She threatens to check me with Rf4+.  If she had been able to check me, she would have gotten a free pawn with Rxe4.} 47. Kh5 {I responded to that threat with Kh5.} Rh8+ {Now she checks me, but I do not care because this check is only a nuisance.} 48. Kg4 Rg8 {I do not know why she made this move, for she knows that she cannot play Rxg5.} 49. Rd1 {I also do not know why I chose that candidate in this position because she is not threatening to play Rxd2, at the moment.} Rf8 {She threatens again to check me and capture my pawn, but I am oblivious to this threat. } 50. d4 {I am trying to force an exchange, but this was a bad move because I did not see the threat.  Therefore, unlike last time, she checks me and gets the free pawn.} Rf4+ {Now, she puts me in a serious check as part of the fork.  That's right, she is playing a fork against me between my king on g4 and my pawn on e4.  } 51. Kg3 Rxe4 {After I come out of check, she gets a free pawn with Rxe4.} 52. d5 {I attempt to break through and get a pawn promotion by playing d5.} Rd4 {She plays Rd4 in order to prevent the break through by forcing an exchange with Rxd4 and exd4.} 53. Rxd4 exd4 54. g6 {Now, I get a pass and attempt a pawn promotion be playing g6. } Kf8 {She plays Kf8 in order to prevent the pawn promotion.} 55. d6 {Since I could not get a pawn promotion with my last move, I try another to get the promotion a different, with d6.} d3 {While I try to get a pawn promotion, she also tries for the same thing, so she plays d3.} 56. d7 {Because I played d7, I am only one step away from promoting my pawn into a queen. } Ke7 {She attempts to prevent the promotion by playing Ke7 and is successful } 57. Nc5 { This was my biggest mistake because I underestimated the power of her king.  That is because I inferred that it did not matter what she did with her king since I was in the winning position and going to win anyway.  My best move would have been g7.  That way, I would have gotten a pawn promotion, and she would not be able to it from happening.  If I had played g7 and she had played Kf7 to stop the promotion, I would have responded with d8=Q, and the promotion would have been inevitable.  Instead, I played Nc5 because I believed that this would prevent her from playing Kxg7 and inhibit her pawn promotion, but I was wrong.  Jack Stockel would say, "That losses immediately", with this move.   } d2 {Because she played d2 and my king was not on e2, d1, d3, or c2, she was going to get a pawn promotion, and I would not be able to stop it.  In addition, I cannot my pawn, with d8=Q because he would simply capture the promoted queen with Kxd8.} 58. g7 {Now that she plays d2, I respond with g7, but it is officially, "Too little, too late" because she is now one step ahead of me, so I am now doomed, in this game.  } d1=Q {This is now her inevitable pawn promotion.} 59. g8=Q {I responded to her pawn promotion by promoting my pawn into a queen with g8=Q.  However, it is still "Too little, too late" because she is going to check me with Qg1+ and win my promoted queen with Qxg8.  In addition, she will continue to check me and win other pieces such as my remaining pawn.  This forces me to resign.} Qg1+ 60. Kh3 Qxg8 61. Kh4 Qb8 62. Kg4 Qc7 63. Kf5 Qxc5+ {This was a very good game.  In fact, this was my second best loss and one of my longest games, but there is and was an important lesson to learn from this game.  In the short term, this game taught me not to underestimate the opponent during pawn promotions.  In the long term, I learned an important fact about end games from Jack Stockel, and it reminds me of this game against anitam.  It also explains how I became overconfident with anitam during the end game.  That is because he played against an opponent, about two weeks ago, and the opponent was winning.  In fact, he almost won the game, but he made some serious mistakes and lost the game because of his overconfidence.  The lesson was, "When you think that you have won, or you are winning, be very careful, and do not underestimate the opponent.  Otherwise, you might start making mistakes and loosing the game." }
