[Black "HiTax (1011)"]
[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23)"]

1. e4 {My favorite first move, personally, although 1. d4 gives White statistically better results.} e5 {Not a bad response, avoiding the Sicilian.} 2. Bc4 {The Bishop's Opening - uncommon but a favorite of Bent Larsen, among others.  I use this to avoid Petrov's Defense, which I deplore, Ruy Lopez, which I've never had good luck with, and the Scotch Game, which I enjoy immensely but tend to play badly with.} Nh6 {A truly bizarre move which unnerves White a bit.} 3. Nf3 {A normal move, attacking Black's hanging e-pawn.} Bc5 {Black makes this move to get his bishop out but is leaving the pawn undefended and giving up the center - what can he be planning?} 4. Nxe5 {White takes what he's been given.} Nc6 {Perhaps Black has no master plan - as it is this is not a bad move though.} 5. Nxc6 {White's first real mistake.  Yes, it forces Black into doubled pawns, but takes White's powerful knight off the board.  Suspect.} bxc6 {Both captures (this one and dxc6) can be derided as bad moves.  This one leaves the queenside weak, and 5...dxc6 basically surrenders the center.  One of them, of course, must be made, and Black picks this one.} 6. c3 {Setting up, evidently, for 7. d4, with control of the center.} Qe7 {The queen's out, and she's now attacking the e-pawn.  Time to retool White's defensive strategy.} 7. f3 {White still has plans for his d-pawn and is looking good right now.} f5 {A good move, on the whole - White's pawn is pinned and thus can't take the f-pawn.  White must defend.} 8. d3 {White's hopes for twin pawns on the fourth rank will have to wait.} d5 {Uh oh.  The e-pawn is looking bad. But the bishop is also attacked, and White has his priorities.} 9. Bb3 {Overall not the best move - White should have dealt with the loss of the bishop instead of the impending loss of the center.} dxe4 {The opening salvo.} 10. Kf1 {White is without all that many good moves, to be honest.  This is not a good one but there really aren't any.  Note the rapid momentum shift.} exf3 {Continuing his one-man wrecking ball, the pawn keeps wreaking havoc on White's formation.} 11. Qxf3 {White has had enough and is not going to leave an isolated f-pawn.  The queen had better take after her counterpart and get going.} a5 {Calculated to get the rook out, maybe?  This move is difficult and unorthodox.} 12. Qxc6+ {A good move. The queen sees a weakness in Black's doubled pawns (this is part of the reason we caution against them) and attacks it.} Qd7 {Black sees the vicious fork White has in place and decides to trade queens to take care of it.} 13. Qxd7+ {If White goes with 13.Qxa8, the Black queen has 13...Qxd3+, a devastating move.  White won't have that and decides to accept the trade offer.} Bxd7 {Black still wants to castle and thus captures with the bishop.} 14. d4 {White has seen the weakness of his d-pawn and strengthens it by attacking the bishop, though his queenside logjam of pieces, as well as his fenced-in rook on the h-file, make for an ugly formation.} Bb6 {A simple retreat.} 15. Kf2 {Really a bizarre move, as Ke2 would have let the rook out and kept the king out of the line of fire.} O-O-O {Gets a rook involved and the king out of the way; a good castle.} 16. Re1 {Gets the rook out.  White's position is looking more and more awkward by the move.  Black's is also a bit weird.  A bizarre game, to put it mildly.} c5 {An attempt to start an attack on the White king.} 17. Be3 {White's got to defend.} f4 {Here we are - White's in for it.} 18. Bxf4 {White has really no choice.} cxd4 {White is ahead on material but not in momentum, tempo, or attack.} 19. Kg3 {White is scrambling and making one bad move after another.} Nf5+ {A good check, Black has a good attack going here.} 20. Kh3 {The only move, really - White is in a bad spot here but were he to move anywhere else it would be worse.} dxc3 {Black misses a discovered check opportunity by moving the knight on f5 but figures he may as well force some movement with the pawns.} 21. Nxc3 {Better than bxc3, as it gets the knight involved, finally, and lets the rook move out.} Bf2 {Black is setting White up to lose his rook, if he's stupid.} 22. Ref1 {And he is.} Ne3+ {This move gets White's rook. Well done.} 23. g4 {Forced.} Nxf1 {Better at this point might have been 23... Nxg3, allowing for a capture of the pawn and another discovered check.  But no worries with the rook gone.} 24. Rxf1 {No other sensible move.} Bd4 {Black is now trying to exploit his numerous advantages, and has missed what White will pull next.  (In fairness, White did too.  They are both patzers, as evidenced by their ratings.)} 25. Bc4 {My favorite chess game is an underrated, less-known game called the "Peruvian Immortal" by Esteban Canal.  It was played at a simultaneous exhibition in Budapest in 1934 against an unknown opponent.  (It is analyzed on this site as well.)  It has been compared favorably to Anderssen's "Immortal Game," since Canal played this at a simultaneous exhibition and may have spent about five minutes thinking about this.  It features, after 13 moves, White (Canal) having sacrificed both rooks and his queen.  He then pulls Boden's Mate on the 14th move.  I all of a sudden saw Black's king in a suitable formation and half of the bishop formation already set up for me, and thought of the surprise ending to that game.  I decided on this move in order to set up the mate in the next move, and pray that Black didn't see it.} h5 {He didn't.} 26. Ba6# {I am sure that I made numerous mistakes, as obviously did Black.  It was a sloppy and awkward game, and outside of the last two moves I am not proud of it. But here we go.}
