1. f4 Nf6 {Team Match, I'm playing black, and my oponent gives me the Bird. Bird's Opening, that is. Black reponds with 1. ... Nf6, the Positional Variation.} 2. d4 d5 {I don't have much material on the Bird, but what I do have likes 1. ... Nf6 and 1. ...d5 for black's first move, so I play them both. Nothing I have suggests 2. d4 as a standard move for white in any line of Bird's Opening. Back to winging it., I'm beginning to suspect that some players on GameKnot deliberately try to break away from traditional lines early, much earlier than I remember from OTB tournament play, and I suspect that the GK DB plays a part in this decision.} 3. e3 Bf5 {I smell a stonewall forming.} 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bd3 Ne4 {The black knight finds a hole in white's wall and invites the white bishop to an exchange.} 6. O-O Nd7 7. Nbd2 Ndf6 {These moves are all in the GK database, and it's forming a pretty picture in the center of the board.} 8. a3 Bd6 9. Ne5 O-O {Now, white needs to play Nd2f3 to complete the pretty picture.} 10. g4 Nxd2 {Dangit, white lbew it, now we need to exchange some material. I considered 10. ... Bxe5, for if white recaptures on e5, then 11. ... Nxg4 wins a pawn. But white could easily refute that plan with 11. gxf5.} 11. Bxd2 Bxe5 12. gxf5 Bd6 13. Rf2 Qd7 {Jockeying for position. This threatens the white pawn on f5 and white should play 14. fxe6.} 14. c3 exf5 {White left it hanging, so black gains a pawn.} 15. Qc2 Ne4 {Inviting more exchanges.} 16. Bxe4 fxe4 {Undoubling the f-pawns. At this point, black is ahead by a pawn, but white has a half-open file aimed right at black's king which might be adequate compensation for the lost pawn.} 17. c4 c6 18. c5 Be7 19. Raf1 a5 {Inviting white to open files on the queenside.} 20. Qd1 b6 {Ditto.} 21. cxb6 Rfb8 22. f5 Rxb6 23. f6 Bxf6 {I am not sure if 23. f6? was well founded. It looked to me like a sacrifice, and I was expecting 23. ... Bxf6, 24. Rxf6 gxf6 to follow. I toyed with it for a while and concluded that white couldn't force a win with that sacrifice, so I accepted the pawn. Then white tried something I hadn't expected.} 24. Rg2 Be7 {With the pawn at g7 pinned, it no longer protects the bishop on f6. It might have been better to move the king, say with 24. ... Kf8. If I had looked far enough ahead, I would have.} 25. Qh5 g6 {White played the expected move, and black responded as planned. I felt the black king was just safe enough where he was. I was wrong.} 26. Rxf7 Kxf7 {26. Rxf7! I think deserves a ! for the danger it presents to black.} 27. Qxh7+ Ke8 {The cowardly king runs for his life. If he can just get behind his queen, all may be well.} 28. Rxg6 Bf8 {The only move that might save the game for black. 28. ... Kd8 29. Rg8+ Kc7 30. Rxa8 Rxb2 31. Bxa5+ Kb7 32. Rg8 and white is up by a pawn heading into the endgame with two passed pawns. As played, black is now attacking white's queen and the bishop prevents a back-rank check. But black is far from out of the woods.} 29. Qh5 Qf7 {White could have tried 29. Qg8 which looks to be his strongest option with the threat of 30. Re6+ Kd8 31. Qxf8 Kc7 32. Qxa8 Qxe6 33. Bxa5 leaves black up by bishop and 2 pawns. Black doesn't seem to have any way to save the bishop. 29. ... Qe7? would be met by 30. Re6. Black's best move might be 29. ... Rb3b1 to prevent white from playing 32. Qxa8, in which case white has nearly equalized, being down by the exchange for a pawn, but with a passed pawn on the h-file. Instead, the move as played, 29. Qh5? lets black off the hook.} 30. Qe5+ Kd7 {And now white has no checks. His rook on g6 is en prise, as is his pawn on b2.} 31. Rf6 Qg8+ {The queen had to move, this lets her move with check, gaining a much needed tempo.} 32. Kf2 Rxb2 {I analyzed white's remaining attack and decided he had nothing to be afraid of, so now seems like a good time to get that b-pawn, which now puts the white bishop on d2 and the white pawn on a3 en prise.} 33. Qf5+ Kc7 {Whie stalled a bit, but he's running out of attack.} 34. Ke2 Qg2+ {Time to counterattack. White has no choice but to trade queens now. Any king move allows black to checkmate: 35. Ke1??? Qxd2+ 36. Kf1 Rb1#.} 35. Qf2 Qxf2+ {If white's rook on f6 didn't protect his queen, then 35. ... Rxd2 would win the queen. In the game, I almost played this automatically (overlooking the white rook). Close call. As it is, black is satisfied with the queen trade, ending up in a queenless endgame ahead by a rook and pawn.} 36. Rxf2 Bxa3 {And now it's smooth sailing. This would have been a much closer game if white had justified the sacrifice of 26. Rxf7! with 33. Qg8! and equalized (or close to it).} 37. Kf1 Bb4 {Trading more pieces. The only move that avoids the bishop exchange is 38. Bc1 which allows a rook exchange instead.} 38. Ke1 Bxd2+ {Instead white allows both exchanges.} 39. Rxd2 Rxd2 40. Kxd2 a4 {Promotion from here is not even necessary. Black could just as easily press for a king+rook checkmate, though he may want to take a little side trip to the h-file to get rid of whit's only threat first. But this approach looks simple enough too.} 41. Kc1 Kd6 42. Kb2 c5 {Black needs an approach for his king, and going around would take too long. At this point my opponent didn't return to the game for a couple days, and I got caught up in my other games so I entered a dozen or so likely continuations as conditional moves. A few days later, while I was asleep, this game finished itself.} 43. h4 cxd4 {Either the d4 or e4 pawn is 3 moves away from promotion, depending on white.} 44. exd4 a3+ {Luring the white king to the a-file where he can't stop the e-pawn from promotion.} 45. Ka2 e3 46. h5 e2 47. h6 e1=Q {Final position. White to move, black to mate in four: 48. Kb3 Qe3+ 49. Kb4 Rb8+ 50. Ka4 Qb3+ 51. Ka5 Qb5# or three if white plays with his h-pawn: 48. h7 Rb8 49. h8=Q Qb1+ 50. Kxa3 Qa1#. Instead, white resigned.}
