1. d4 {Hi everyone!  I have been thinking more about the thread that Coach Ion started about Pawn Majorities in our Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Club.  I have two perfect examples of play between one of my fellow Club Members, Patzerblitzer (Chris), a Class B Player who is in Master Freddy (Easy19's) mentoring group C.  In both games, Chris played the opening and the middlegame very well but alas, for him, it all went awry in the endgame.  Why did this happen?  Well, somehow I managed to utilse pawn majorities in the endgame to my advantage and sadly this meant that it did not work out for Chris.  So, here is the first of these two games and Chris lurves to kick off with 1. d4 and I usually follow suit with d5.} d5 2. e3 {2. e3 - opening up a line for his lsb.} Bf5 {2. ...... Bf5 - development and hitting out at c2.} 3. f4 {3. f4 - hmm, this is becoming a Stonewall.} Nf6 4. Nf3 {4. Nf3 - both sides develop their king knights.} e6 5. Bd3 Bxd3 6. Qxd3 {6. Qxd3 - bishop trade.} c6 7. Nbd2 Nbd7 {7. ...... Nbd7 - a symmetrical position - almost.} 8. O-O Qc7 9. Nb3 Ne4 {9. ...... Ne4 - time for a little equine entrenchment.} 10. c4 Be7 11. Nbd2 Ndf6 {11. ..... Ndf6 - bolsters this entrenched knight.} 12. c5 O-O 13. h3 Ng3 {13. ..... Ng3 - planning a further entrenchment.} 14. Re1 Nfe4 {14. .... Nfe4 - both steeds back each other up.  I try and put a choke on Chris' position but can I make further progress?  We shall see.} 15. Nf1 f5 {15. ...... f5 - with the idea of a rook lift to f6/g6/h6.} 16. Nxg3 Nxg3 17. Kh2 Ne4 {17. ...... Ne4 - retreat forced but at least the knight's entrenchment is likely to be of longer tenure.} 18. Bd2 Rf6 19. Ne5 Rh6 20. Reg1 Bf6 {20. .... Bf6 - hmm, maybe Bh4 might have been better.  You, the Inquest Jury decide!} 21. Be1 Qe7 {21. ...... Qe7 - time Glenda got in on the act.} 22. Qe2 {22. Qe2 - what ho!  So late on in the middlegame and we are still getting, what - symmetry?!} Bxe5 23. fxe5 {23. fxe5 - B for N trade.} Kh8 24. Bb4 Rg8 {24. ..... Rg8 - still not given up the idea of a mating attack.} 25. Raf1 g5 26. g4 fxg4 27. Rxg4 {27. Rxg4 - pawn trade.} Rh4 28. Be1 Rh5 29. Qf3 {29. Qf3 - allo, allo, allo!  The Wicked Witch of the West is doubling up on the f column.  Next move, Henry bravely steps to g7.  I think you have guessed it.  It is a typical jstevens1 ploy - when there is pressure, trade, trade, trade!} Kg7 30. Kg2 Rf8 31. Qe2 Rxf1 32. Qxf1 {32. Qxf1 - this rook trade now only leaves the Witch on the f file.  Next comes a queen trade.} Qf7 33. Qxf7+ Kxf7 34. h4 h6 {34. ...... h6 - bolsters my g5 pawn.} 35. hxg5 Rxg5 36. Rxg5 hxg5 {36. ...... hxg5 - over the last few moves, my mits have been hovering over the Offer Draw button.  However, after the recent trades I now consider myself effectively a pawn up.  I remembered my Expert Lesson in Pawn endings from Paolo about 5 years back when material was even but one side was left with doubletons.  That time it was me and I learned never to trade down to a pure king ending with the doubleton.  In this case, it is Chris with the doubleton and if he exchanges down to that king ending, well .......} 37. Kh3 Kg6 38. Kg4 Kh6 {38. ...... Kh6 - trying to keep the opposition and put Chris in a zugzwang.  However, he does still have a strong dsb so it might well come down to the 50 move rule before I agree a draw.} 39. a3 a6 40. b3 Kg6 {40. ...... Kg6 - now it is I who must avoid the zugzwang.  My knight has no moves!} 41. b4 {41. b4 - not a good idea - now it is Chris' bishop who is suddenly left with no moves.  What a conundrum!} Kh6 {41. ..... Kh6 - but at least Henry does!} 42. Kh3 Kh5 {42. ..... Kh5 - so after Chris has been forced to retreat his king, Henry moves onwards and upwards.} 43. Kg2 g4 {43. ...... g4 - suddenly I have this passed pawn just 3 squares from Glendadom, wow and double wow!} 44. Bg3 {44. Bg3 - om, om, om, uh oh, Chris!  I now have a chance to exchange into a king and pawn ending, but will my ravenous sea food loving king find any juicy p(r)awns?  We shall see.} Nxg3 45. Kxg3 Kg5 {45. ..... Kg5 - the importance of the opposition can be worth an extra queen in the ending!  Now King Chris must retreat.} 46. Kg2 Kh4 {46. ..... Kh4 - and Henry puts the squeeze on!} 47. a4 g3 {47. ..... g3 - now only 2 squares to reach utopia!} 48. Kg1 Kh3 49. Kh1 g2+ {49. ...... g2+ - my pawn forces King Chris into a stalemate position.  The pawn on g2 will be consumed by King Chris but look at all those lurvely juicy white p(r)awns!  Henry is in for a feast!} 50. Kg1 Kg3 51. b5 {51. b5 - hoping to push one of his queenside pawns to promotion.  However, after a long analysis I now set up some conditional moves.  Never you fear, Henry is just about to have the time of his life!} Kf3 52. bxc6 bxc6 {52. ...... bxc6 - the Joblock works to deadly effect.  Chris is absolutely starved of any counterplay whatsoever on the queenside.} 53. a5 Kxe3 {53. ..... Kxe3 - gobble!} 54. Kxg2 Kxd4 {54. ...... Kxd4, gobble!} 55. Kf3 Kxe5 {55. ..... Kxe5 - yum, yum!  It ain't over yet!} 56. Ke3 d4+ {56. ..... d4+ now the white pawns on c5 and a5 are absolute sitting ducks!} 57. Kd3 Kd5 58. Kc2 e5 {58. ...... e5 - it is gonna be a black pawn race to Glendadom!} 59. Kd3 e4+ {59........ e4+ - King Chris is driven back.} 60. Kc2 Kxc5 {60. ...... Kxc5 - after Henry devours yet another pawn, Chris waves the white flag.  Commiserations Chris.  I think you were in this game until your decision to exchange down to a pure K & P ending.  Do you the Inquest Jury agree?  Anyhow, I will have part 2 ready for you very shortly.  Until then, bye for now - Joanne}
