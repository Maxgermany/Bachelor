1. e4 {I had to annotate this game. I had a winning position, a superior passed pawn and I was very lucky to get a draw. I made a couple of seriously poor decisions around move 28. } c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. Nc3 Qc7 5. d3 Nd4 6. Ba4 a6 7. Nxd4 cxd4 8. Ne2 e5 9. O-O b5 10. Bb3 d6 11. f4 Be7 12. Ng3 O-O 13. a4 bxa4 14. Bxa4 Bg4 15. Qe1 Be6 {Was not sure the reason for the Bishop retreat. It opens up my black diagonal perfectly when I do the natural reply of f5. Black's white bishop becomes somewhat useless. It gives me the initiative and black is somewhat cramped.} 16. f5 Bd7 {Now the bishop needs to be moved again.} 17. Bb3 {And now my bishop is in a better spot.} Rfb8 18. Bg5 a5 19. Bxf6 Bxf6 20. Nh5 Bg5 21. h4 {At this point Qg3 immediately might have been better. That pawn at h4 was a thorn in my side later.} Bh6 22. Qg3 Kh8 23. Bxf7 Rxb2 {This move doesn't seem like the best for black. I was expecting Bc6 to force my Bishop out. Then Rxd2. I think Black maintains the initiative with that.} 24. f6 g6 25. Bxg6 hxg6 {I believe this is the real blunder. I haven't found it yet, but there has to be a mate after this. } 26. Qxg6 Be3+ 27. Kh1 Rg8 28. Ng7 {28. f6! If RxQ 29. f8 Rg8 30. Qf6 Rg7 31. QxR Mate 28. f6 Qd8 29. fxg8  Qxg8 30 Qxd6} Be8 29. f7 {29. Nxe8 works better} Bxf7 30. Rxf7 Qxf7 31. Qxf7 Rxg7 32. Qe8+ Kh7 33. g4 Rxc2 34. Rxa5 {34. Qh5 interposing the Bishop doesn't work because of g5. I knew I could force a draw with Qh5, but I still think I can do better. But before taking the pawn I needed to bring my Queen to h5 to put it in a better position. Then Rxa5 is fine. And I am still threatening mate if he gets to ambitious.} Rc1+ 35. Kh2 Bf4+ 36. Kh3 Rh1+ 37. Kg2 Rxh4 38. Kf3 Rh3+ 39. Kg2 Rg3+ 40. Kf2 Rg3xg4 41. Qh5+ Bh6 42. Qf5+ Rg4g6 43. Ra8 Rc7 {}
