1. e4 {A challenge to a co-worker of mine, at his request. Our first game went quite long, and involved me blundering away my queen in the opening then slowly scratching my way back into the game and eventually winning it what was my second-longest game on GameKnot. This is our third game and I begin with the Open Game.} b6 2. d4 {Black plays the Queen's Fianchetto Defense, also known as the Owen Defense. The experts recommend that white should grab the strong classical center, and I agree.} c5 3. Nf3 {Black diverges from the recommended lines (2. ... e6 or 2. ... Bb7 or even 2. ... Ba6, the Guatemala Defense) and strikes at the white center. White defends with development.} Bb7 4. Nc3 {Black strikes at the center again and white defends again with development.} Nf6 5. e5 {This time black's strike at the center is met with the pawn's advance, reminiscent of Alekhine's Defense.} Nh5 6. dxc5 {5. Nh5? was inexact. It seems that white can immediately win this knight with 6. g4?, but that would be a mistake. The pawn on g2 defends white's knight on f3 which in turn defends d4. If 6. g4?, black simply plays 6. ... cxd4 and now white cannot recapture as his knight is pinned and his queen is the only piece defending that pinned knight. Sure, white still has 7. gxa5? dxc3 which simply exchanges knights or, much better, 7. Nb5 a6 8. Nbxd4 d6 9. e6 Nf6 and black's knight escapes. So, much simpler is to simply eliminate the concern first with 6. dxc5; black's knight is still trapped on h5.} bxc5 7. Bc4 {Again, 7. g4 looks very tempting, but it still fails to gain the trapped knight after 7. ... g5! and now if 8. gxh5, black replies with 8. ... g4 striking at white's pinned knight. Instead, white opts for developing a piece and preparing to castle. We'll see about grabbing that knight after white's rook moves off of h1.} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 {7. ... Bxf3?? was a serious blunder that will cost black his rook. I just recently annotated two games featuring the Orangutan (Polish) opening where an early advance of white's b-pawn led to problems protecting his queen's rook, and now here in this game it's black's turn to have his queen's rook in danger due to his early advance of his b-pawn. I'm starting to see a theme to add to my opening theory: keep your b-pawn home until you have a dang good reason to move it. I jokingly asked my friend "Whatever did you do that for?", referring to the fact that white now has a three-way fork against black's rook, knight, and checkmate on f7, and his reply was that he favors knights over bishops, so wanted to trade away my knight. } Nc6 9. Bxf7# {After 8. Qxf3 I entered a handful of conditional moves. I expected 8. ... e6 or even 8. ... f6, but I threw in the wild ones just in case the unexpected happened. And it did. Black saved his rook and I got an email notification that I had won a game by checkmate. As it would happen, I just finished annotating a game where I, as black, won white's rook in the aforementioned Orangutan game and white resigned on move 9, making it my second fastest win on Gameknot. This game, which I won just two days later, ties for that second place honor, but, since this game ends in checkmate, it is my fastest checkmate on GameKnot.}
