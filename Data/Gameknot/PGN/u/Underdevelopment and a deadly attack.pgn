1. e4 e5 {King's Pawn opening } 2. Qh5 {?! Already a very unusual move, though if Black does not know what he's doing, this move could be catastrophic (the best example is 2...g6?? 3.Qxe5!) } Nc6 {! The best move to reply to this threat - preventing Qxe5 and planning to drive away the queen next move } 3. Bc4 {setting up the 4 move Scholar's mate - this is handled easily enough } g6 {this move also sets up a possible fianchetto kingside. Although the bishop to g7 might not be effective right now (its scope is blocked by Black's e5 pawn) it could be useful in setting up a sneaky trap later on - for example, what if there's an undefended piece on c3 and a piece on f3? } 4. Qf3 {once again, White threatens Qxf7 mate (though it does bar the f3 square for the knight), but Black can, once again defend easily... } Nf6 {...by developing a piece to block the queen's attack on f7. Now, Black is now thinking of a future Nd4, putting the knight on a strong square and once again threatening the queen } 5. Ne2 {! Stopping any idea of Nd4, developing and preparing to castle. Not bad. } d6 {opening up the diagonal for my light square bishop (but closing in my dark square bishop - it would probably have been better to develop it first) and threatening Bg4, driving the queen away } 6. h3 {preventing the threat...but after I saw this move I immediately saw 7.g4, and realised that 8.g5 would win my knight (it can't be moved because of Qxf7 mate) I can only see 7...g5 as a way to stop it, and that puts my pawn in an uncomfortable position  } Be7 {I prepare to castle instead (maybe Bg7 would have been better here) } 7. g4 {as expected... } O-O {this isn't the most desirable castling position for my king... (a strong move for White here would be d3, followed by Bh6!) } 8. O-O {? The castling position is even worse for White! The whole point behind castling is to get your king to safety, and as it turns out, the king was much safer on e1 } b6 {fianchettoing my light square bishop would be very powerful here, if I could get the h1-a8 diagonal clear of pieces (especially considering the position of the king) } 9. a3 {? a wasted move. This serves no purpose whatsoever for White's game } Bb7 {fianchetto, as promised } 10. c3 {?? instead of developing, White is just making his position worse. He has just locked down all his pieces and it will take some time to free up his position (and of course the fact that the pawn move does nothing) } Rb8 {the bishop needs to be protected for my combination to work. Only one more move... } 11. g5 {? the move to save White here is 11.d3!, both stopping my planned attack and a step towards freeing up White's position (12.Bh6, then 13.Nd2) now White is going to be in serious hurt... } Nxe4 {! knight sac! White can't completely ignore it because Nxd2 forks Queen and Rook. The best thing to do is to move the Queen - but where? the only available moves are Qd3 and Qg4, and then Black simply plays Nxg5 for a great game } 12. Qxe4 {White accepts the sacrifice, allowing Black a powerful attack.... } Nd4 {Of course, the knight cannot be taken because Bxe4 wins the queen. Where can the queen move now then? if Qd3; 13.Qd3 Nf3+, then 14...Ne1+, winning the queen. If Qe3, Bxg5 forces the queen to d3 or g3, which are both bad squares for the queen. If g2 or h1, Nxe2+ wins the queen AND the knight. If Qh4, Bxg5 forces the queen either to g3 or.... } 13. Qg4 {to the g4 square, where Black can further pressure White with.... } Bf3 {! Now there are only two squares for White. Qg4 is met with Bxg5, forcing the queen to.... } 14. Qg3 {the g3 square. Now White is going to suffer... } Nxe2+ {! Royal check, with a free knight thrown in as well! } 15. Kh2 Nxg3 16. Kxg3 {White is now officially busted! } e4 {Instead of retreating the bishop, Black provides protection for it to maintain its influence } 17. h4 {What can White do in this situation? } d5 {! The bishop cannot escape, because Black threatens mate in 2 } 18. Bb3 {White doesn't see the threat, and after my next move, he resigned, but I'll play through the mate anyway... } Bd6+ 19. Kh3 Qd7# {Although the mistakes weren't obvious blunders (obvious blunders meaning moving the queen to where a pawn could take it), White mate two major mistakes over the course of this game (in particular moves 8-10) 1) 8.0-0? Just because White could have castled here doesn't mean he should have - and if he really wanted to castle, he shouldn't have played g4 2) 9.a3? and 10.c3??, these two moves blocked in his queenside pieces (notice how none of them had been developed at the end of the game) and allowed Black too much control of the board, which was how he was able to capture the queen }
