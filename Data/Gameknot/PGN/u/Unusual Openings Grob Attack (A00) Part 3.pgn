1. g4 {Hi again, everyone!  This is the second of the THEM mini-tournaments.  THEM27-33 Fritz Gambit.  I am playing black against Guy.  Guy got his revenge in this game and here is how he did it.} d5 2. Bg2 Bxg4 3. c4 e6 4. Qb3 c6 {4. .... c6 - on move 3 I played e6 at the right time as the pawn on c4 blocked off a queen fork on a4.  I create a hedgehog type defense on that h1-a8 diagonal.} 5. Nc3 Qb6 6. cxd5 Qxb3 7. axb3 {7. axb3 - queen trade.  After that I recapture with cxd5.  This turns out to be a mistake.  exd5 was better because at least it would have prevented that pesky white knight from landing on b5 which it does next move.} cxd5 8. Nb5 Kd7 {8. ..... Kd7 - Henry avoids a knight fork - for now.} 9. h3 Bf5 10. d3 Nc6 {10. ..... Nc6 - a developing move.  I would have liked to have played a6 here but it would have been no use because the pawn on a6 is pinned to the rook on a1.} 11. e4 {11. e4 - meanwhile, Fou Leblanc is menaced.} Bb4+ 12. Bd2 Bxd2+ 13. Kxd2 dxe4 14. dxe4 Bg6 {14. ...... Bg6 - after trying to speed up my development with check, I had to get Fou Leblanc out of a white pawn's path.  I have had no time to address the problem of the knight on b5.} 15. Nf3 Nge7 {15. ..... Nge7 - here is where the computer tells me this is a question mark move.  It is a developing move but Nf6 should have been played.  If e5 then my knight could come to d5 blocking off the d column.} 16. Ke3 Rhc8 {16. ..... Rhc8 - creates a flight square for Henry, but this is going to allow a knight fork which leaves me just a pawn for the exchange.} 17. Rhd1+ Ke8 18. Nd6+ {18. Nd6+!! - owwwch, owwwch and treble owwwch!  Bang goes the exchange and 10 rating points.  With this mess of a position I was mighty relieved to have escaped with a Low Draw at the end of the game.} Kf8 19. Nxc8 Rxc8 20. Rac1 Ke8 {20. ..... Ke8 - preventing Rd7.} 21. Nd4 Rd8 22. Nb5 {22. Nb5 - threatening Nc7+ winning the other rook.  There is no option but to exchange it off.} Rxd1 23. Rxd1 Nc8 {23. .... Nc8 - a passive move but I wanted to prevent a N or R incursion on d6.} 24. f4 Ke7 {24. ..... Ke7 - a bit better but white has a big advantage.} 25. h4 a6 {25. .... a6 - finally I play the move which I wanted to for many moves, a6.  I drive back the knight, but alas, not far enough.} 26. Nd4 Nxd4 27. Rxd4 {27. Rxd4 - not too good to trade while down, but I just wanted to see white knights disappear from the chessboard.  Fullstop.} Nd6 28. Bf3 f6 {28. ...... f6 - tempting white into a move like e5?? If he plays it then I will be able to return the complement - Nf5+.} 29. b4 {29. b4 - alas, he does not fall for it.} Be8 30. b3 Bf7 {30. ..... Bf7 - I now begin to scratch around.} 31. Kd2 e5 32. fxe5 fxe5 {32. ..... fxe5 - pawn trade.  At least all of the white pawns are now split.  But do I have enough compo for the exchange?  Only time will tell.} 33. Rd3 Nb5 34. Bd1 g6 35. h5 {35. h5?! - A surprising move.  Guy gives back a second pawn for the exchange.  Both my kingside pawns are isolated and very vulnerable to attack and this will tie Fou Leblanc down to defending them.  So, even with the material counter now reading zero, I still feel - advantage white.} gxh5 36. Rh3 Bg6 37. Bxh5 Bxe4 {37. ..... Bxe4 - with just white queenside pawns to worry about, my drawing chances are increasing by the minute.  If my kingside pawns were connected, however, I might have been thinking about winning here.  But they are not - they are separate and they need defending.} 38. Re3 Nd6 39. Be2 Ke6 40. Rh3 Bg6 41. Bg4+ Ke7 {41. .... Ke7 - still scratching around.} 42. Ke3 Kf6 43. Rh2 Ke7 {43. .... Ke7 - more of the same.  I am considering a draw offer here but cannot as yet bring myself to hit that button.} 44. Rd2 Nf5+ 45. Kf2 {45. Kf2 - white does not wish to exchange his active bishop for my knight.  I would have certainly felt better with a bishop and two pawns for a rook rather than a knight and two pawns for a rook - at least a bishop, even a bad bishop, is a lot more mobile in an open position like this.} Nd6 46. Rd5 e4 {46. ..... e4 - now Fou Leblanc is tied to the defense of my kingside pawns.  I must be careful to avoid a zugzwang here.} 47. Ke3 b6 48. Re5+ Kd8 49. Be6 {49. Be6 - This move prompts Henry to head for the queenside where my pawns could be vulnerable to attack.  Although the remaining white pawns are doubled, they are fiendishly difficult to attack.} Kc7 50. Bh3 Kc6 51. Be6 {51. Be6 - it looks as if white is quite happy to repeat moves here.  I therefore finally manage to psych myself up to kiss 10 rating points goodbye and hit that offer draw button with a heavy heart.  It is time to bite the bullet and suck a lemon and console myself with the fact that at least I haven't dropped the full 20 points here.  Even so, with my rating dropping to 1921, I am going to have to get some really good results in my remaining games to avoid losing my near-Expert status.} Kc7 {}
