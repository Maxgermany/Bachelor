1. d4 {[%clk 0:05:03] } g6 {[%clk 0:05:03] } 2. Bf4 {[%clk 0:05:05] } Bg7 {[%clk 0:05:06] } 3. e3 {[%clk 0:05:08] A new try for my standards. I'm ready to exchange the dsb if needed.  } b6 {[%clk 0:05:09] Well, it surely looks ok. But we were on an amateur, blitz base, so why not... } 4. Qf3 {[%clk 0:05:08] ...and see what happens? Unfortunately I don't know theory, and I bet this must be bad. But let's see why... } Nc6 {[%clk 0:05:11] } 5. Nc3 {[%clk 0:04:42] A double edged move, more complicated than c3. Of course c4 was a possibility, but then I must have suffered from the B's dsb. No way. My aim with the text was c7.  } Bb7 {[%clk 0:05:13] } 6. Qg3 {[%clk 0:04:12] switching target, and avoiding complications like Na5. Be3, thinking in Be4 was interesting, too, but all is too complicated for a blitz! } d6 {[%clk 0:05:02] Protecting c7 and preparing e5. } 7. Bb5 {[%clk 0:04:11] Now I plan to exchange the B in order to get more space on the center (e4,d5) } a6 {[%clk 0:04:44] } 8. Bxc6+ {[%clk 0:04:04] } Bxc6 {[%clk 0:04:46] } 9. d5 {[%clk 0:04:07] } Bb7 {[%clk 0:04:49] } 10. e4 {[%clk 0:04:09] Now, black can exchange his only good B left for my N and scramble my pawns. I bet I can handle that better tha a B pair later on.  } e5 {[%clk 0:04:51] Now I think that Retiring the B would have been the better option. White is solid and has space advantage on a closed board against the B pair. But I wanted to attack somewhere, and I risked... } 11. dxe6 e.p. {[%clk 0:04:10] ...but this drops e4, fatally, unless I spend a tempo playing f3. It was a possibility, for sure, but I didn't want to need it. It was a mistake.  } fxe6 {[%clk 0:04:53] e6's weakness is not easily exploitable, and I lost my good center, opening the way to B dsb. A serious mistake.  } 12. Qg4 {[%clk 0:03:54] } Bxc3+ {[%clk 0:04:36] Ok, I said I will accept that.  } 13. bxc3 {[%clk 0:03:54] } Qf6 {[%clk 0:04:39] } 14. Ne2 {[%clk 0:03:38] Practically forced, allowing... } Bxe4 {[%clk 0:04:35] Now, the move should have been obvious for a tactic player like I'd like to be:  } 15. Bg5 {[%clk 0:03:35] ? Looking for tactic in the wrong way. Nd4 was much better.  } Qf5 {[%clk 0:04:28] I couldn't see anything better than... } 16. Qxf5 {[%clk 0:03:21] } exf5 {[%clk 0:04:20] ...So I am a pawn down, and about to lose another one. Well done, Damalfi, this is sooo great! Now, under the circumstances, which is the "flaw" I can find in black's position... if any? How can I stop him to grab which of my pawns... f3, Bxc2, a4 (trying to trap the B with Nd4, but c5!.  } 17. Nf4 {[%clk 0:03:07] This blocks black's predictable kicking of my B.  } h6 {[%clk 0:04:10] Ah, why? Let's see:  } 18. Nxg6 {[%clk 0:03:05] } Rh7 {[%clk 0:04:14] } 19. f3 {[%clk 0:02:55] Needed if I don't want to lose the g pawn. Besides, I am looking for the f column... } hxg5 {[%clk 0:04:09] } 20. fxe4 {[%clk 0:02:57] } fxe4 {[%clk 0:04:12] } 21. O-O {[%clk 0:02:55] ...and only now I can see what I "felt": there is "something" based on this position. Well seen, I think black can "survive it all" after o-o-o, but on blitzes...} Ne7 {[%clk 0:04:00] Can I be so lucky?} 22. Rf8+ {[%clk 0:02:51] } Kd7 {[%clk 0:03:58] } 23. Rxa8 {[%clk 0:02:37] } Nxg6 {[%clk 0:04:01] Not really sure about if there was a better way for me to go (maybe involving the other Ra-f1), but this must be enough. Still, my opponent, rightly, made me work a little more. In the way, I stepped in an very nice bind that crushed my opponent.  } 24. Rxa6 {[%clk 0:02:37] } Rf7 {[%clk 0:03:58] } 25. Re1 {[%clk 0:02:38] } d5 {[%clk 0:04:00] } 26. c4 {[%clk 0:02:35] I think this was the right move. Black can't help to lose one pawn more, if I'm right.  } dxc4 {[%clk 0:03:23] } 27. Rxe4 {[%clk 0:02:36] } Re7 {[%clk 0:03:19] } 28. Rxc4 {[%clk 0:02:36] } Ne5 {[%clk 0:03:20] } 29. Rd4+ {[%clk 0:02:33] } Kc6 {[%clk 0:03:21] } 30. Ra3 {[%clk 0:02:26] Now it's the moment to be patient and don't risk to return the courtesy, on the way to victory.  } Kc5 {[%clk 0:03:20] } 31. Rd1 {[%clk 0:02:21] Why not? } Nc4 {[%clk 0:03:20] } 32. Rc3 {[%clk 0:02:21]  } b5 {[%clk 0:03:17] } 33. Rf1 {[%clk 0:02:19] } Kb4 {[%clk 0:03:16] } 34. Rg3 {[%clk 0:02:17] } Ne3 {[%clk 0:03:11] } 35. Re1 {[%clk 0:02:14] Black must concede the R exchange, after which my R will prevail without contest.  } Nd5 {[%clk 0:03:09] } 36. Rxe7 {[%clk 0:02:16] } Nxe7 {[%clk 0:03:13] } 37. Rxg5 {[%clk 0:02:20] Snatched another one, and... look into the position: the black N has it very, very hard to "bypass" white's R guard: can you see? My h pawn will win the game without any effort. I saved the game mainly to remember this particular R / N asset. For black it is virtually impossible to reach g6 or c7. The rest of the game is of no interest.  } c5 {[%clk 0:03:16] } 38. h4 {[%clk 0:02:22] } c4 {[%clk 0:03:19] } 39. h5 {[%clk 0:02:25] } Kc3 {[%clk 0:03:23] } 40. h6 {[%clk 0:02:28] } Kxc2 {[%clk 0:03:14] } 41. h7 {[%clk 0:02:30] } Nc6 {[%clk 0:03:15] } 42. h8=Q {[%clk 0:02:32]  } c3 {[%clk 0:03:19] } 43.
