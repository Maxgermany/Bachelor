[Opening "Gedult's opening (A00)"]

1. f3 d5 2. Kf2 {The bad thing for black with this opening is that if black doesn't win, he feels like an idiot... and often he is.} e5 3. e3 Nc6 4. g3 d4 5. Be2 {No pont in dxe and exchange queens. } Bc5 6. a3 {The "normal" move is to stop the b4-b5 advance. But I wanted to surprise him. This is the risk of this kind of opening. } Nh6 {My idea is to press strongly e6, so I set my knight in order to do that... maybe.} 7. b4 Bb6 8. c4 {First interesting moment. If I take the pawn, I help him. If I don't, he threats to trap my bishop. I didn't foresee this move, but I must "demostrate" I did, so I considered to play the only other reasonable choice. Here is one variant I saw...   8.	c2-c4	d4-d3 9.	c4-c5	d3-e2 10.	g1-e2	d8-f6 11.	c5-b6	e5-e4 12.	b1-c3	f6-f3+ 13.	f2-g1	c8-h3 14.	e2-f4	f3-d1+ 15.	c3-d1	h3-g4 16.	c1-b2	e8-g8 17.	b4-b5	a8-d8 18.	b5-c6	d8-d2 19.	d1-f2	g4-f3 20.	c6-b7	g7-g5 21.	f4-g2	h6-g4 22.	b6-a7	g4-f2 23.	a7-a8	f2-h3+ 24.	g1-f1	f3-g2+ 25.	f1-e1	d2-b2 26.	b7-b8	b2-b8 27.	a8-b8	f8-b8 28.	e1-e2	} dxc3 e.p. {At last, I wasn't sure, so I played the "simple" one. } 9. Nxc3 Nd4 {If he takes the knight, I recover the piece in a way or another, after pawn xd4, Na5, d3+, NxB, PxB, NxP, PxN... maybe playable by him, but with an edge for me, despite the pawn, due to a much more active position and open play (Qd5...).} 10. Na4 {How to demostrate him that I foresaw this move and that it was part of MY plan? Because the knight is still safe, now for a new reason: Qxd5+, threatening the rook.  } Be6 {Another surprise. I am threatening Bb6. A better reason to play KxB. As if I thought that this is good to me. And actually it is!} 11. Bb2 {Incredibly complex, for my standards. Bb3 doesn't win a piece, this is for sure. Nor the white queen need to retire. I considered deeply Nb3, but the weakness of e5 is dangerous. It makes me lose a movement playing f6 or o-o, even if in some variants I can let him take in g7.  I will probably go for the simpler one, but there is a word of tactics around here. } Bb3 12. Qe1 {I never expected this one... it makes things easier for me...} Nc2 13. Nxb6 Nxe1 14. Nxa8 {Now, the simpler one is QxN, RxN, and I am only +1. But my queen is trapped, and he has good game in the center. Note that my knight isn't playing... So I wanted to surprise him again. } Nd3+ 15. Bxd3 Qxd3 {This leaves unattended the a8 knight... a risk, but I thought that the attack I have worths it, even allowing the next to moves...} 16. Nxc7+ Kd7 {Now, I have double threats.} 17. Bxe5 Qxd2+ {Of course! This "must" win, or I am lost!} 18. Ne2 f6 {Now, this was the mistake. I was considering here Nf5, and this would have been a winning move, I think. I thought, mistakenly, that it was more or less the same to play this one before or after. No way.} 19. Bc3 {Didn't see it. Even now, probably Qc2 was better. } Qd3 20. Ne6 {I cannot take the knight! What a shame I didn't see it before...} b6 {Just to avoid Nc5! Boooooo...} 21. Ne6f4 {He has grouped his pieces... the play is tactically lost for me. Now I have a lot of work in order to save my queen!} Qc4 22. Rhc1 Qa6 23. Nd4 Qa4 {I am playing an idiot... :-)))  23.	e2-d4	a6-a4 24.	c1-b1	b3-c2 25.	b1-c1	h8-c8 26.	c1-c2	h6-f5 27.	c2-d2	f5-d4 28.	d2-d4+	d7-e8 29.	c3-d2	g7-g5 30.	f4-h5	e8-e7 31.	a1-c1	c8-c1 32.	d2-c1	a4-c2+ 33.	c1-d2	c2-b2 34.	d4-d3	b2-c2 35.	d3-d5	c2-b3 36.	d2-c1	b3-a2+ 37.	d5-d2	a2-b1 38.	c1-b2	b1-h1 39.	b2-f6+	e7-e6 40.	f6-g5	h1-h2+ 41.	f2-e1	h2-h5 42.	f3-f4	h5-h1+ 43.	e1-e2	h1-g2+ 44.	e2-d1	g2-g3 45.	d2-e2	g3-g1+ 46.	d1-d2	g1-a1} 24. Rcb1 Bc2 25. Rbc1 Bb3 26. Rcb1 Bc2 27. Rbc1 {At this point, I analyzed Rc8, looking for some phantom to save me. But no.  If NxN, RxB, ok. But if Nxb? Qb3, ok.  But if Ne2, I had nothing.  Sad but true. } Bg6 {But I was not looking for draw! } 28. Rcd1 {He didn't take the bishop. He loved too much his two knights, or he feared some king of counerattack on the h columns... with some good reasons!} Kc8 {Sad necessity. The knight out of the inmediate reach of a Knight jump!} 29. Rac1 {Just shaking. } Kb7 {My queen is safe, but trapped. If I don't get my pieces into the game, I'm finished!} 30. Bb2 Rc8 {He cannot exchange. If RxR, QxR threatening to win the bishop after the check. } 31. Rd2 {Now what?}
