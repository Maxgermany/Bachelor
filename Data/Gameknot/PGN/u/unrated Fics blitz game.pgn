1. d4 {I played a pretty (but probably not very sound) knight sacrifice, getting two pawns and a dangerous pawn roller. Then I won a piece, and the rest was just endgame technique. (not very good technique, because I allowed a pawn fork in time-trouble)   (edit: I'm athorist on the free internet chess server)} Nf6 2. c4 d6 {I've pretty much given up on the Benko gambit, until I learn more.} 3. Nf3 g6 4. g3 Bg4 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O Re8 8. Bg5 Qc8 9. Qc2 Bh3 10. Rad1 Bxg2 11. Kxg2 e5 12. e4 Nc6 13. d5 Nb4 14. Qd2 Nxa2 15. Nxa2 Nxe4 {The sacrifice didn't look anywhere near sound, but it did look interesting.} 16. Qc2 f5 17. Nc3 Nxc3 18. bxc3 {Avoiding 18. Qxc3 e4!} h6 19. Be3 f4 20. gxf4 {Now white's king looks exposed.} Qg4+ 21. Kh1 Qxf3+ 22. Kg1 exf4 23. Bd4 {Defending against ... Re8-e5-g5#.} Qe4 {I couldn't see an immediate checkmate, and g6 was undefended, ruling out ... B-moves.} 24. Qxe4 Rxe4 25. Rde1 Rae8 {Forcing the exchange of rooks} 26. Bxg7 Kxg7 {... Rxe1 27. Bxh6 Rxf1+ 28. Rxf1 looked too complicated.} 27. Rxe4 Rxe4 28. Rb1 Rxc4 {... b6 (and if 28. Ra1, a5) was also playable} 29. Rxb7 a5 30. Rb3 Kf6 31. Kf1 Ke5 32. Ke2 g5 {My king can't advance further (... Ke4 32. f3+), so I plan g6-g5-g4 and f4-f3+} 33. Kd3 Kxd5 34. Rb5+ Rc5 35. Rb2 c6 {Kc6 was probably better, or ... a4 and if Ra2, ... Ra5 ("the rook belongs behind the passed pawn")} 36. f3 Rb5 {?? Blunder - allows 36 c4!} 37. Ra2 Kc5 {A lucky escape} 38. c4 Rb3+ 39. Kc2 Kb4 40. Rxa5 {A good move} Kxa5 41. Kxb3 c5 42. Ka3 h5 {I can force a passed pawn on the kingside, and the white king is occupied defending the queenside} 43. Kb3 g4 44. fxg4 hxg4 45. Kc3 f3 {... g3 was clearly better, but this still wins (time trouble!)} 46. Kd2 Kb4 {47. Kd3 Kb3, and white is in zugzwang}
