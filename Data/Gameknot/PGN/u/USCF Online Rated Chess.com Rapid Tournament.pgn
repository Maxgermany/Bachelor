Be2 fxe5 12. fxe5 cxd4 13. cxd4 {I have been in this position several times.   What should Black play? } Rxf3 {This sacrifice is common in this opening.  Now White's pawn center collapses. } 14. Bxf3 Qb4+ {Now 15. Qd2 is better for Black after 15... Qxb5 16. Be2 Qb6 17. O-O-O Qc7 18. Kb1 Nb6.} 15. Nc3 { } Nxd4 16. O-O Nxe5 {This just barely favors Black. } 17. Nxd5 {A blunder. } Nexf3+ 18. gxf3 {Even more losing than he already was.  White can do better with 18. Rxf3 exd5 (18... Nxf3+ is not good here. 19. Qxf3 Qc5+ (19... exd5 20. Qxd5+ Be6 21.

Rg1 Qh6 {Inaccurate.  24... Qe7 is just slightly stronger. } 25. f4 Rf8 {Although still losing, White's best choice is 26. Rg5.} 26. Qe5 {Now Black can win with 26... d4 27. Qxd4 Rxf4 28. Qd6 Qh3 29. Qb8+ Rf8 30. Qxb7 Bg4. } Qf6 27. Qc7 d4 {This is quite strong, but 27... Bf5 is actually the better move. } 28. Qxb7 Qf7 {Winning, but this is not as good as 28... Rd8, because now White can trade queens. } 29. Qc7 {This was no doubt a mouse slip, so White resigned.  }
