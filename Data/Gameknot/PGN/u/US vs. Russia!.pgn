[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 {...but that makes victory all the more sweet!  (Yes, this was a team game, and I got clobbered in the other one!)  The game concludes with a queen sacrifice.} d6 {The Pirc?  Really?  I haven't seen that since the old chessmaster 4000 used to kick my ass with it.  Black aims for a KID-type setup, but often denies white the big queenside associated with it.} 2. f4 {!?  An unusual move order.  I like it because it can transpose to the King's Gambit declined if black plays e5 here (or even back to the King's Gambit Accepted), which can be fun, but it moreover immediately challenges black's decision to play the Pirc, declaring an intent to pawn-storm the kingside.  That, and it invites transposition to the austrian attack (main line) of the Pirc as well.} g6 {Continuing with a standard plan of development for the pirc.} 3. d4 {Setting up a big pawn center.  This is what black wants white to do.  But it's also what I want to do.  If I can get my pieces developed with a big center, a lot of space, and can deprive black of those things, why wouldn't I?} c6 {More normal is Bg7 here, taking us into the main line of the Austrian attack.  But this is playable, too, opening the a5-d8 diagonal for the queen.} 4. Nf3 {Yeah, he's going to play Bg7 and Nf6, and this is a good, aggressive square for the knight.} Bg7 5. Be3 {Over-defending d4 and developing the bishop to a good, solid square.  At this point, it looks like playing Bd3, either Nc3 (not c4 and then Nc3) with an eventual queenside castle will give me excellent attacking chances on his kingside.  c6 committed him to castling there, and I'm prepared to go right after his king!  By the way, the game DB has never seen this opening before!} Nf6 {Attacking the undefended e4 square.} 6. Bd3 {Nice and simple development.  I thought about plunging in with e5 right away, but after dxe5, dxe5 allows the exchange of queens, killing white's advantage, and fxe5 allows Nd5, giving black activity and freedom.  This just reinforces white's already dominating center.} Bg4 {A nasty pin.  But the bishop doesn't have much hope right now, and will probably be exchanged for my Nf3 soon.  So I'm not going to concern myself with it, yet.} 7. Nc3 {Better than c4 followed by Nc3.  Why? Because white is going to attack black on the kingside, and is quite clearly aiming for a queenside castle.  Why weaken the queenside pawns if I don't have to, and why waste a move playing c4 when I could be furthering my own ends?  But I thought about Nd2 as well; I wound up choosing this because of the coverage of the d5 square and the d1 square, which may become important after I play 0-0-0.} O-O {Perfectly consistent.  But is this a good setup for black?} 8. h3 {And this is why having a plan helps -- it may not be the greatest plan ever -- but my moves are now working together towards achieving some goal.  As I get closer, new goals appear.  (It's kind of like life that way.)  Now I see that black has to either exchange, developing my queen strongly to f3, or run back to d7 (everything else is awful).} Bxf3 {The right decision.} 9. Qxf3 {Hey!  Look at that; we are back in the game DB, apparently this is an uncommon line in the Pirc, Austrian Attack with 6. Bd3.  And this is a great setup for me; I'm really happy with how this has turned out.  I have the two bishops, I have a monster center, I have the beginnings of a kingside pawn storm, and once I play 0-0-0, my development will be completed.  Black is playing catch-up the rest of the way.} Re8 {Preparing e5.  I don't know why not Nbd7 first, though, which also prepares e5 and develops an undeveloped piece.} 10. O-O-O {Ready for anything, now.  The Rd1 opposite the Qd8 actually has me looking forward to black's e5.} e5 {No surprise here.} 11. dxe5 {This allows the Rd1 to gain some more scope, but the real reason is that the f-pawn is too useful in storming the kingside to exchange it here.} dxe5 {Naturally.  But now what for me?  Sure, moving the bishop will cause him to move his queen, but he wants to play Qc7 anyway.  What I really want to do is pawn-storm the king, but what to do about the threat on the f4 pawn?} 12. g4 {Well, apparently, I'm going to ignore it.  g4 is a move that has its advantages, but basically commits white to having three pawn islands if black plays exf4.} Nbd7 {?!  It's hard to argue with this move too much, but white is controlling the entire flow of the game now, and black needs to do something to reduce white's edge; I prefer exf4 here.} 13. f5 {This is much stronger with g4 behind it; white's pawns are going to roll up the black kingside if he's not careful.} b5 {Counterplay on the opposite side of the board is an excellent idea.  But I will not be distracted, especially since black's pieces are out of position to support this push (and if b4, Ne2 or even Nb1 is fine).} 14. g5 {I had thought about fxg6 here, but this really cramps black on the kingside, and tempos the knight, AND forces it to a bad square (h5).} Nh5 {...otherwise it gets taken for insufficient compensation.} 15. h4 {looking to make a very strong play down the h-file eventually.  I also considered f6, but I'm in no rush; it's better for me if black plays gxf6 first.} Qc7 {Reasonable, but this never accomplishes much, other than letting the Nd7 move freely.} 16. f6 {Undoing black's fianchetto.} Bf8 {Better than the entombing option, Bh8.} 17. Be2 {Some think the spectre of Nc5 is my reason for this move; in reality, I want to attack the h5 square.  The game has been pretty straightforward for me so far.} Bc5 {Who does this help?  If Bxe3, Qxe3 allows me to attack h5, which is what I wanted in the first place.} 18. Kb1 {?!  Maybe my only inefficient move of the game.  I didn't know what was going to come on the queenside, but this move seemed like it was better protection for the king, plus it stops black from knight-checking the king on e2 or d3 (the knights are 2 moves away from those squares).} Bxe3 {You say goodbye...} 19. Qxe3 {...and I say hello.  Hello, HELLO!  And now there seems to be a lot of kingside pressure again, while black must address the threat to the Nh5.} Nf4 {?!  If ever there was a time for b4, this was it!  Why, because it forces white to play the awkward Na4 or else face something like 19. ...b4 20. Bxh5 bxc3 21. Bg4 cxb2, with good counterattacking chances.} 20. Bg4 {While this solves all of white's problems; b4 is now met with Ne2.  Additionally, h5 is now threatened.} Rad8 {Preparing to strike back in the center.} 21. h5 {But black's attack is getting there quickly.} gxh5 {Now, I'm not exactly sure how good this is.  Black's pawn structure was the only thing keeping white's attack at bay.  But allowing hxg6 forces black to either respond hxg6, having to respond to mate threats down the h-file, or fxg6, where the f7 square begs for a pawn fork.  This will work out okay only if black can neutralize white's kingside attack or start his own quick counterattack, which he's unable to do.} 22. Bxh5 {Of course.} Nb6 {Black correctly assesses that Nxh5 followed by Rxh5 gives white too strong of an attack down the h-file.  This move also threatens Nc4, coming after the queen.} 23. Be2 {?!  Another inaccuracy in view of Nc4.  I should've played Bg4 here, looking for Bf5.} Rxd1+ {Interesting!  I can recapture with one of three pieces; which to choose?} 24. Nxd1 {!  The bishop belongs on f5, and I need to give it the freedom to get there.  The queen belongs in tandem with the rook on the h-file, so I know not to move the rook.  The knight would do better on e3 than c3, though, so I prepare to get it there.} Nd7 {Ooh.  When I saw this I realized that this is black's only way to defend against mate on h7!} 25. Qf2 {And if I can get the queen to h6, there's a mate threat on g7 also!  The plan is Qf2-h4-h6-g7#.} Nf8 {To defend the threat coming on h7.  The only other option was to try running with the king.  Nxe2 fails to 26. Qh2 Nf8 27. Qh6 with mate on g7 to follow.} 26. Qh4 {Threatening Qh6.} Rd8 {Nxe2 loses immediately to Qh6; this is black's attempt to flee with the king.} 27. Qh6 {Threatening mate on g7.} Nf4e6 {The only way to defend the dual threat of Qg7# and Qxh7# is with his knight tandem on f8 and e6.  How to crack it open?} 28. Bg4 {Bg4!  Where the bishop should have gone when I played Be2 back five moves ago.  Bg4-f5-h7 will bring down the house, if I can make it happen.  Black looks pretty helpless here.} Qd7 {!  Clever!  Black forces white to delay Bf5 in light of the back-rank mate threat.} 29. Ne3 {A perfectly sufficient way to parry the threat.  The d1 square is adequately defended now.  Note how Kc1 would have allowed Qd2 , giving black some chances.} a5 {There's nothing else at this point.} 30. Bf5 {The threat on h7 is now overwhelming.  If another wasteful move like 30...a4, 31. Bxh7  followed by either 31...Nxh7 32. Qxh7  Kf8 33. Qh8# or 31...Kh8 32. B-anywhere  Nh7 33. Qxh7# (or 32...Kg8 33. Qh8#).  Black is busted, and has no defense to mate.  He decides to make me sac my queen to get it.} Ng6 {Leaving h7 undefended.} 31. Qxh7+ {This is my first material edge of the game except for my half-move one-point advantage on move 11.} Kf8 {Forced; the only legal move.} 32. Qh8+ {Forcing Nxh8.} Nxh8 {And having just "won" the white queen,} 33. Rxh8# {Black gets checkmated.  Thanks to vdatsuk for a great game!}
