1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nc3 g6 7. h3 Bg7 8. e4 a6 {The new modern lines avoid playing ...a6 so early to keep ideas like Na6-b5 or Na6-Nc7 alive. } 9. a4 Nbd7 {The key idea behind the benoni is to maintain control of e5. If black can do that then white has very little hope of success. } 10. Bd3 {White has setup an old classical formation which to this day is very good for white. Though Be2 is also good. } Qe7 {the older lines suggest 0-0 with some meager chances of success. The new approach of putting the Queen on e7 supports d6 while at the same time adds pieces to e5. My idea is to play ...Ne5 forcing the exchange of my weaker knight for white better knight. While at the same time neutralizing any immediate chance of e4-e5 happening. } 11. O-O O-O 12. Re1 Ne5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. a5 {14.f4 is met by 14...Qd4+ 15. Be3 Qb4} Rb8 {This is a common idea in the Benoni. Black commits for better or worse to force b7-b5 to open the b-file with good pressure on b2. } 15. Ra3 {An excellent move preparing to put the rook on b3 directly defending b2 and contesting for control of the b-file. } Re8 {A flexible move that pins white's two active minor pieces to the defense of e4. The alternatives 15...Nd7 and 15....b5 are also worth considering. } 16. Rb3 Nd7 {Necessary as b6 will become a weakness after b7-b5. White wants to play Na4 with eyes on b6. } 17. Na4 b5 {In most cases if black can play b7-b5 with success then he is doing well. } 18. axb6 e.p. Qd4 {Forcing the knight to retreat or rook to move in order to win the pawn back. } 19. Ra3 Nxb6 20. Be3 Qf6 {Necessary in order to maintain the balance on b6. } 21. Rb3 Qd8 22. Rxb6 Rxb6 23. Nxb6 Qxb6 {The position is dynamically balanced with a slight advantage to white because of his better bishop placement.  Black have sufficient play on the queen side. } 24. Qa4 {A good move that targets a6 and e8 at the same time. } Rf8 25. Rb1 a5 {Suddenly black is in trouble. } 26. Bf4 {Black always has to watch out for an attack on d6 and a timely e4-e5. } Bb7 {one way that black has to prevent e4-e5 is to attack d5 directly. } 27. Qb5 Qxb5 28. Bxb5 {Black has gone from the frying pan to the fire, whites two bishops are flying! It looks as though black is almost dead. } Rd8 {only move} 29. Bc4 {White wants to try and play e4-e5 snuffing out the DSB. So because black attacks d5 directly white has to first support d5. } Bd4 {Only thing going for black right now is that the rook is pinned to b2. This also keeps white's king pawns in check for the time being. } 30. Kf1 {White does have a tangible advantage but yet there is no clear line to the king. When defending it is always best to keep lines to the king closed.  } a4 {When behind the 8-ball the magical cure is to drum up counter play. } 31. Ra1 {Best I think was 31. Ke2} f5 {I am trying to break the white centre so it is not so easy to secure the point. } 32. Rxa4 fxe4 {White still has a winnable advantage but I have managed to create some counter play. } 33. Ke1 Bxb2 34. Ra7 {ugh this looks grim as a rook on the second last rank usually spells disaster. } Bc8 35. Bg5 {Trying to weaken d6} Rf8 {I aim to now set up a fortress} 36. Rc7 Bc3+ {Hoping for kd1 } 37. Ke2 Bd4 {Threatening Bxf2} 38. Kd1 h5 {I just found a wicked defensive resources that will save the game! } 39. Be7 {It looks like d6 has fallen but it is untouchable! } Bf5 {fortress is now complete} 40. Bxf8 {I give up the rook why? The position is essentially closed rendering white's rook and bishop useless. This is a classic example of the power of owning the bishop pair and setting up a fortress. If 40. Bxd6 Rb8 41. Bxc5 Bxc5 42. d6+ Kf8 43. Rxc5 Rd8 44. Rc6 Kg7 45. Ke2 Kf6 46. Ke3 Ke5 is a draw. } Kxf8 {the king is close enough to g6 and d6 to protect it. White now has insufficient resources to deal the fatal blow.  } 41. Ke2 g5 {Only move} 42. Bb3 {White is on to my plan so he plans to put his bishop d1 in order to prevent me from creating a past pawn} h4 43. Bd1 g4 {Forces white's hand} 44. hxg4 Bxg4+ 45. Kd2 h3 {Threatening h2 } 46. gxh3 {Has to take } Bxh3 47. Bh5 Bf1 {Creating a net around the king and aiming at gobbling the poor d5 pawn} 48. Rf7+ Kg8 49. Rd7 c4 {The pawn and bishop pair make it a draw game. } 50. Rxd6 c3+ 51. Ke1 Bc4 52. Rc6 {The d5 pawn falls and black has secured a well fought draw. }
