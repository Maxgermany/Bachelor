[Opening "Danish gambit (C21), Soerensen defence"]

1. e4 {This is a training game for a teammate in Kingslayers.  Please add your comments so we can all learn together.} e5 2. d4 {a center game.} exd4 3. c3 {c3 is offering the Danish gambit.} d5 {I prefer not to give up the center to two attacking bishops and no development, so I like the Soerensen defense.  d5 allows both of my bishops to get into the mix and provides a counterpunch in the center.} 4. Qxd4 {A fairly common response, White wastes no time regaining pawn parity and has a strong presence with the queen.} Nf6 {Standard development.  Aids the d pawn.} 5. Bg5 {Applying pressure to the knight to pin against the queen.} Nbd7 {protecting the f knight but also offering a queen trade if White really wants it.} 6. Qxd5 Nxd5 7. Bxd8 Nxc3 {I knew that my options to castle would die, but I opted to try something different.  Perhaps keeping the knight and immediately retaking with 7.... kxd8 would have been better, planning to retake the pawn with Bxf2 down the road, but I just wanted to see what would happen here...  If White takes Bxc7, I can retake Nxe4.} 8. Nxc3 {Best response from White.  Any time you can regain parity and develop a piece, it's a win.} Kxd8 9. Nf3 Bb4 {We're pretty even at this point.  White needs to try and get his castle on to link up his rooks if possible.} 10. Bc4 Bxc3+ {breaking up his pawns that would eventually threaten my queenside.  My hope is that the 3-2 pawn advantage will turn into a promotion.} 11. bxc3 f6 {protecting the pawn from the bishop} 12. O-O c6 {Giving my king a space for a manual castle.} 13. Rad1 {Adding pressure to my knight, perhaps with an eye towards Be6 down the road.} Kc7 14. a4 {I'm not certain of the utility of this move.  The lone pawn can only do so much.  Odds are bringing the knight closer (Nd4) to the Black king would provide more options for mounting an attack.  The other downside is that this move allows Black to go up a pawn.} Nc5 15. e5 {I think ultimately White would be better served to keep the pawn on a4, as two passed pawns down the line can spell trouble.} fxe5 16. Nxe5 Nxa4 {Despite being up a pawn, I need to get my rooks into the game.} 17. Rd4 {I'm not interested in taking the c pawn as that would give his rooks and two pieces direct lines of attack on my king.} b5 {Hope to chase away that pesky bishop into a less desirable location.} 18. Bd3 {Good spot.} Be6 {finishing my development} 19. Nf3 {I thought White might consider c4 here instead.  This move seems to telegraph a later Ng5 option.  Generally speaking, center positions are stronger for knights, so this seems like a retreat to me.} h6 {Taking away the Ng5 option.} 20. Re1 {rooks like open files!} Nc5 {Allowing me to get my own knight back into the game and protecting the bishop at the same time.  Side benefit is that this move also prevents an immediate formation of a rook battery.} 21. Be4 {Giving up a knight for that bishop is very tempting, but I'd rather trade rooks first to give me more of an advantage.} Rad8 22. Rxd8 Rxd8 23. Bc2 {A bishop is worth far more than a knight right now with this very open board, so wise play on White's part.} a5 {Looking to take advantage of that pair of passed pawns.} 24. h3 {Not quite a wasted move... preventing a back-door mate is an okay plan, but with no immediate threat, perhaps a better position for your power pieces would be more valuable.  Moving the knight to d4 perhaps.  This move seems more like a waiting move than forward progress.} a4 {White is probably getting nervous about the a-b pawns, as well he should.  They are about to be trouble.} 25. Nd4 {Better late than never!  As Black I now have to deal with the double attack on the LSB.} Kd6 {I like this move better than Rd6 or Re8 because I will eventually need to get my King down to help secure promotion of the pawns.  Also, I want to keep my bishop on this diagonal to help protect my pawn march.  Note that if I move the bishop instead, I give up a pawn from Re7+.} 26. Be4 {Not certain what White is thinking here, but I will absolutely trade my knight for his bishop.} Nxe4 27. Rxe4 Bd5 {This move should be expected.  Centralization and protection of the bishop.  Note I now also can attack g2} 28. Nf5+ {White is now just helping me go where I want to anyway.  If he takes the g7 pawn, it's bad news.} Kc5 29. Rd4 {Decent move, thanks to the protecting c3 pawn, restricting White's King's movements.} a3 {The LSB will allow me to march my pawn to a2 with no resistance.  White is about to be in big trouble because he will have to dedicate a piece to prevent promotion or trade piece for pawn.  Note that my king is way closer than his to the action, which should be able to provide a decisive difference.} 30. Ne3 {Wise play.  He is going to need both pieces to effectively block my promotion.} a2 {Decision time for White...} 31. Nc2 {White makes a blunder here and I didn't see it.  } Ra8 {A much better play is Bb3.  Note that White needs to pieces to stop the promotion since my King is right there.} 32. Na1 {It is better for White to trade knight for pawn here rather than block.} Ra3 {This move is the clincher, as it will allow my king to get into the game and force an unfavorable trade on White.  All in all, not too bad a game for a new player.  Thank you for your comments and suggestions.}
