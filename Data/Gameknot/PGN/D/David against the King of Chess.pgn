1. e4 {The King of Chess opens with the King Pawn! What a surprise ...} c6 {Black defends with the Caro-Kann.} 2. Nf3 {This move is not in the opening book. It's not the sicilian, your majesty.} d5 3. e5 Bg4 4. d4 e6 5. c4 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Qa5 7. Nc3 Ne7 8. a3 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 Qc7 10. h3 Bf5 11. g4 {Too many pawn moves by White} Be4 12. Rh2 Ng6 13. Nd2 Nd7 14. Nxe4 {White gains the Bishop pair, but the position is closed, so knights are preferred here.} dxe4 15. Qe2 c5 16. Qxe4 cxd4 17. Bxd4 Ndxe5 {Opening up the position - probably not the best strategy for Black, because now the White bishops become powerful.} 18. c5 {White's Rook is hanging, so Black takes advantage of it.} Nf3+ 19. Qxf3 Qxh2 20. Bb5+ Kf8 21. c6 bxc6 22. Qxc6 Rd8 {Black's kingside is horribly developed, but Black is up the exchange and should be able to hold he position, since the kingside pawns provide shelter.
