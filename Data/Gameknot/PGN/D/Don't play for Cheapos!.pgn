1. Nc3 g6 2. e4 c5 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 {5. Nxc4 - Voila - un Sicilian Dragon!} Nc6 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bc4 O-O {7........ 0-0 black tucks his king away - I will castle queenside and this will be a race to mate!} 8. Bb3 d6 9. f3 Na5 10. Qd2 {10. Qd2 - these moves are the beginning of a Yugoslav Attack.  One spur of it is to try to remove the black dsb and home in on the weak squares the exchange leaves behind.  The next thing is to try to open up the g and h files to the white heavy pieces so that the black king can come under a blistering mating attack.} Bd7 11. O-O-O Rb8 12. Kb1 b5 13. h4 {13. h4 - the start of a kingside pawn storm.} Nc4 14. Bxc4 bxc4 15. Ka1 h5 {15. h5 - all database moves, black tries to keep the g and h files closed.} 16. Rdb1 Re8 17. Bh6 Bh8 18. g4 hxg4 19. h5 Nxh5 {19. ......... Nxh5 - taking me out of the database.  I now play for cheapos as follows:-} 20. Rxh5 {20. Rxd5 - OK if it is someone at or below your rating.  If Freddy takes then this could happen:-  Variation A 20. Rxh5 gxh5  21. Qg5+ Kh7  22. Qxh5 Bg7  23. Qxf7 Kxh6  24. Rh1+ Kg5  25. Qxg7+ Kf4  26. Qf7+ Ke5  27. Qd5+ Kf6  28. Rh6+ Kg7  29. Qg5+ Kf7  30. Rh7+ Kf8  31. Qg7# Variation B 20. Rxh5 gxh5  21. Qg5+ Kh7  22. Qxh5 Bxd4  23. Qxf7+ Kxh6  24. Rh1+ Kg5  25. Rh5#  Variation C 20. Rxh5 gxh5  21. Qg5+ Kh7  22. Qxh5 Bf5  23. Qxf7+ Kxh6  24. Rh1+ Kg5  25. Rh5+ Kf4  26. Qxf5+ Ke3  27. Qg5+ Kf2  28. Rh2+ Kg3  29. Qh4+ Kf4  30. Qxg4+ Ke3  31. Nf5#   Freddy also has this solution:-  "easy19: This should be the best solution.   22. Qg5+ Kh7 23.Qxh5 Be6 24.Nxe6 Kg8 25.Qg5+ Kh7 26.Rh1 Qa5 27.Bd2+ Qh5 28. Rxh5#." Beware though it can come unstuck if your opponent is the Master Mater.  Freddy finds an excellent in between move as you will see. } Bxd4 21. Qxd4 e5 {21. ........ e5 - blocks off the a1-h8 diagonal.} 22. Qf2 gxh5 23. Nd5 {23. Nd5 - to try to prevent the Wicked Witch of the West settling in on b6 and virtually forcing a queen trade.} c3 24. b3 {24. b3 - would Nxc3 have been an improvement, jury?} Re6 25. Be3 {25. Be3 - retreat forced, if Glenda tries to back him up with Qe3 then Kh7 could be problematical for Fou Lenoir!} Rg6 26. Rg1 gxf3 27. Rxg6+ fxg6 28. Qxf3 {28. Qxf3 - I start to think about redressing the material deficit but ....} Qh4 {28. ........ Qh4!! - the Wicked Witch is threatening a nasty check on e1.} 29. Nxc3 Qe1+ 30. Nb1 Rf8 31. Qg2 {31. Qg2 - hoping for a perpetual.  If QxB then Qxg6,  but .......} Bg4 32. Bxa7 Rf1 {32. ....... Rf1 - here I wave the white flag because the only way I can stop Old Matey from striking on b1 is for Glenda to give up her life for the f1 rook.  I am already the exchange down so I have had enough.  Well played Freddy!  Joanne}
