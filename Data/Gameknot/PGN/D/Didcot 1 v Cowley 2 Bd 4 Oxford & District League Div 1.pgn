[Opening "French (C17), Winawer, advance, 5.a3"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {The Winawer or Rubenstein Variation of the French Defence.} 4. e5 {White prevents immediate loss of a central pawn before asking the question of the bishop.  The advance claims extra territory and reduces the options for Black's kingside knight but doesn't help White's development and exacerbates the vulnerability of White's pawn on d4.  the game is already double-edged.} c5 {Black immediately creates pressure on d4, to be followed by ...Nc6 and Qb6 or Qa5 or Qc7 at some stage soon, depending on the situation and Black's preferences.} 5. a3 Ba5 {A relatively unusual continuation that's become quite popular in recent years.  I'm used to playing against the commoner 5...Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Qc7 or Ne7 7. Qg4 with very sharp play.} 6. Be3 {Already forced to think for myself, I chose to bolster d4 and threaten c5 before developing my kingside or moving my Q.} cxd4 {Black continues to release tension by swapping on d4, which puts my B slightly out of position.} 7. Bxd4 {I wasn't comfortable with the prospect of 7. Qxd4 Nc6.} Nc6 8. Bb5 {Pinning the N seems a satisfactory alternative to Qg4.} Nge7 9. f4 {With Black about to castle, releasing the pinned N, I felt the need to bolster e5 with a pawn, before developing my KN.} O-O 10. Nf3 Nxd4 11. Nxd4 Bd7 12. Bxd7 {I felt it was better to swap than retreat, even though it seemed to be a good B for a bad B and seemed to be what Black wanted.} Qxd7 13. O-O {I was aware that this could be risky if Black continued to pile pressure on d4 with a pin (...Bb6) but worked out that I could cope.} Rac8 14. Ncb5 {d6 looked a very attractive square for this N.} Nc6 15. Kh1 {Time to get out of line, as planned.  Later in the game the consequence is that I have to worry about back row mates.} Nxd4 16. Nxd4 {Now the N won't reach Nirvana on d6 but my position remains sound, I feel.} Bb6 {Surprisingly late.} 17. c3 Rc4 {Black continues to pile pressure on d4, the theme of most versions of the Winawer.} 18. Qd3 {If White is to hold d4, the rooks need to be brought onto the d-file without weakening the current defence of the N.  I also considered N moves and Rf3 but the move played seemed best.} Bxd4 19. cxd4 {White's centre now seems solid ut the c-file is already occupied by one black rook.  Surely the other will double there soon?} f5 {?!  This surprised me as I was sure that Black's rooks both belonged on the c-file.  Now I could divert Black's KR on the f-file.  I thought quite long and hard about my response.} 20. exf6 e.p. {The proud but static pawn structure is disrupted for the sake of diverting Black's rook.} Rxf6 21. Rad1 {This was played primarily to release the Q from defending d4.  At this stage I was still nurturing unrealistic dreams of launching a kingside attack.} a6 {A mysterious waiting move.  Black played hesitantly throughout this game, I felt, though there were usually good reasons for some of his slower moves.} 22. b3 {I felt that budging the rook was worth the price of weakening the queenside pawns, which seemed under no obvious threat ...} Rc8 23. Rf3 {?? failing to notice the coming double threat see my hints of faulty thinking in earlier notes.} Qd6 {!  This wins a pawn, if Black can afford the time - and he has shown little respect for tempi so far!} 24. g3 {Taken by surprise and forced to decide between my f-pawn and my a-pawn, I eventually decided to forgo the opportunity to set up a frontal attack on Black's kingside from the third rank and defend f4.} Qxa3 {I realised that the Q on a3 gave Black attacking chances on c1 but I was still slightly surprised that Black took the pawn with such alacrity.  I now set up a prolonged and tenacious defence of the back three rows.  What may seem like aimless manoeuvring of Q and Rs usually meets specific threats or creates some threats of my own.} 25. Rf2 g6 26. Qe3 Qd6 27. Re1 Rc6 28. Rfe2 Kf7 29. Kg2 Qc7 30. Rb2 Ke7 31. Qf3 Kf7 32. Ree2 Rc3 33. Qf2 Ke7 34. Re3 Kd7 35. Qd2 Rxe3 36. Qxe3 Rf8 37. Re2 Qd6 38. h4 b5 39. Qd3 Rf5 40. Rc2 Rf8 41. Qc3 b4 42. Qa1 Rc8 43. Ra2 Rc6 {With only a few minutes left on our clocks, Black decided he couldn't make progress.}
