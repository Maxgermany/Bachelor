1. e4 {Another game from the Ruy Lopez mini-tournament.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Be7 7. Re1 O-O 8. c3 d5 9. exd5 e4 { I don't play the Ruy, so now I'm not sure if this is main line or not. } 10. dxc6 exf3 11. d4 {I'm notating this game after-the-fact for once, and I don't remember what all was happening here. Perhaps I'm trying to get a pawn up on d5.} Re8 12. Bg5 Bg4 13. h3 Bh5 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. g4 Rxe1+ 16. Qxe1 Bg6 17. Nd2 {I know I'll get the pawn at some time.} Qd6 18. Qe3 {He may think my queen's after the pawn, but I've got another idea. He's starting to get fewer pieces on his back row, and I plan to take advantage of that.} Qxc6 {I wanted the queen there. He doesn't see the danger his queen & rook are in.} 19. Re1 Kf8 20. g5 {Here comes the trap. The best he can do now is to take the pawn.} Bd8 {Stop here. Do you see White's winning move?} 21. Bd5 {Here's the Remove the Defender tactic in action.    If he captures the bishop, I play Qe8#. If he moves the queen to d7, then I win a rook}
