Kc5 Ka4 68. Nc6 b4 69. Nxb4 {Though white has a 3 pawn advantage, he has insufficient force to achieve mate, so the game is drawn due to a dead position.  See move #64 to see how white could have won this game! 20:20 hindsight doesn't help here, but perhaps this mistake will help me recognize it BEFORE telling my opponent on move 65 that 64. Nc3 would have won the game!  Koullis' reply was "Really."  If any of you have comments, I'd love to hear your point of view!  Thank you, Lloyd Graham}
