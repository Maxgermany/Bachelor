1. e4 {As I don't know hardly any ways to open the game up, I like to make this my first move as white. } e5 2. Nf3 {More of my standard proceedings} d6 {I see this move a lot but I don't understand it as it blocks in the dark squared bishop. } 3. d4 exd4 4. Qxd4 {I prefer this over Nxd4 as this gets my queen involved in the game early. Sometimes it pays off, others not so. I'm a gambler by nature.} Nc6 5. Qd5 Nf6 6. Bg5 {Pinning down the knight for now. Allowing me one more move at least before I must decide where to put my queen.} Be7 {Freeing up the knight.} 7. Qd3 Nxe4 8. Qxe4 {A fine exchange for me.} O-O 9. Bxe7 {I'm not sure what the plan was. I think I over looked the knight.} Nxe7 {Easy take.} 10. Ng5 {At this point the plan is to get my queen to h7 for checkmate.} Bf5 {Blocking the queens path and putting it in danger as well as protecting h7 once my queen goes to h4.} 11. Qh4 {Keeping the h7 dreams alive. However now I must dispatch of that pesty bishop.} Nc6 12. Bd3 {In an attempt to get rid of the bishop.} h6 {And the dream dies.} 13. Bxf5 {If hxg5 then Qh7#. } Qe7+ {Distracting me from all attacks.} 14. Kd1 {I saw this as a better play because then my h1 rook could get into play faster than my a1 rook could. } Qf6 15. Bh7+ {This forces the king to h8 from there I could move my bishop and the pawn on h6 would be unable to take my knight on g5. And also protected by the knight it could stay there and keep the pressure on black.} Kh8 16. Nc3 {Simple development to get more pieces involved. Maybe Re1 could have led to some better playing options though as well as control of the file.} Nb4 17. Be4 {Not sure why I pulled out of there.} Qd4+ {Again taking away attack moves and distracting me. Also, further forces me left because 18. Ke1...Nxc2  and then I loose my a1 rook.} 18. Kc1 Rae8 {This means my bishop is all but immobile because I don't want the black rook to have the e file.} 19. a3 {Forcing the knight away.} Nd5 20. Nxd5 f5 {Nifty move forcing me to either give up the e file or be creative.} 21. c3 {Creative I was.} Qe5 22. Nxc7 {More attacking forcing my opponent to defend.} Rec8 23. Nce6 {More forced moves. } Rf6 24. Bxb7 Rb8 25. Bc6 Rg6 26. f4 {Nf7 is the much better move. Not sure how I missed it. If 26. Nf7  assume 26...Kg8 27.Nxe5 and the queen is no more.} Qe3+ {A nice counter by black.} 27. Kb1 Qb6 {In search of Qxb2#} 28. b4 {Kc2 would have been better as it would allow my king movement behind the pawns and if blacks queen took b2, the rooks have each others back.} Qxc6 {Looking for Qxc2 putting pressure on my rook. } 29. Kb2 Qxg2+ {Forcing me to b3 as moving to b1 or c1 looses my h1 rook.} 30. Kb3 Qd5+ 31. c4 Qd3+ 32. Ka4 {Forced. 32. Ka2...Qc2#} Kg8 {This frees the pawn to take the knight which is a further distraction as I have to deal with that and the roaming queen.} 33. Rad1 {Ra-c1 would have been better. This would have protected my c4 pawn.} Qc2+ 34. Ka5 {Only play.} Qxc4 35. Qh5 {Looking to get the rook.} Qb5# {I never saw it coming. Literally, I over looked it totally. This was a great game all the way around. A few over looked moves meant the demise of me in this game. }
