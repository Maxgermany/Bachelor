[Opening "Saragossa opening (A00)"]

1. c3 {Preparing 2.d4, and bolstering the d4-square prior to moving there. This is a solid opening, but a poor one development-wise as it stops the b1-knight from reaching its best square, c3, and will waste a tempo if White decides to play c4, which is common in queen pawn openings.} Nf6 2. d4 e6 {A Nimzo-Indian setup, except for White's pawn being on c3 instead of c4 - and White cannot play 3.Nc3, the main line of the NImzo-Indian.} 3. Nd2 d5 4. b3 {Supporting the c4-square to prepare for 5.c4. I see nothing wrong with 4.c4, a belated version of the Queen's Gambit. 4.b3 also prepares to fianchetto White's dark-squared bishop...into what? It is then blocked by White's own pawn chain.} Bd6 5. Bb2 Bd7 6. Ngf3 {White needs to open up the queenside, unblock his fianchettoed bishop and gain more space with c4 soon.} Nc6 7. e3 {White appears to have a Slav Merano-type position, but is very cramped - he needs to open his position up with c4. White has clearly not been learning his opening theory - in all queen pawn openings playing c4 is important.} Ne7 8. Bd3 O-O 9. O-O {Both sides castle kingside, and the position appears to have stagnated - with both positions rather closed, I can see no immediate opportunities for livening the position up.} Re8 10. Ng5 h6 11. Qf3 {The first sacrifice. White is looking to open up the h-file and put his queen on h3, threatening checkmate on h7. Of course, the Black knight on f6 has to disappear first...} hxg5 12. g4 a6 13. Qg2 {I can't see why White's queen doesn't go directly to h3.} Bb5 {An error by Black. After 14.c4 if Black moves the light-squared bishop then 15.c5 wins Black's trapped dark-squared bishop.} 14. c4 Bd7 15. c5 {As we can see...} Bb5 16. Bxb5 axb5 17. Nf3 {White can bide his time. Black's bishop isn't going anywhere...} Ne4 {With no coaxing needed, Black's knight relinquishes its defence of h7. With White's light-squared bishop gone, perhaps he sees no more threat...} 18. Qh3 c6 19. cxd6 Qxd6 20. Rfd1 f5 {Opening up Black's kingside even more. I think f6 would have been better, preventing White's knight from approaching Black's kingside.} 21. Rd2 {The second sacrifice. To completely shut off Black's e4-knight from the action and leave Black's pawn on g5 unprotected, allowing a much more powerful checkmating threat} Nxd2 22. Nxg5 Ref8 {Turns a checkmate in two (Qh7  kf8 Qh8#) into a checkmate in one.} 23. Qh7# {And when the smoke or dust (I can't remember which) has cleared, Black has been checkmated. His extra rook, as he has just realised, no longer matters.}
