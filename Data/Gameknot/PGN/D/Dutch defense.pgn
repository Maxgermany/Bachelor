1. d4 {very common...} f5 {I should not do f5, but Nf6, but this was a thematic game(minitournament) and so I had no choiche.} 2. c4 Nf6 {This 2 moves are very common(the first moves when you look in the chess database)} 3. Nf3 {relatively not common, 212 out of 1872 in the chess database. I cant good explain why I did.} e6 {very common move(chess database) You get a strong row of pawns(the pawn at f6 is defended better) and you have a better defending against the pawns who stand at d4 and c4. And it is the preparation for my attack in move 5. Until this move it is the Dutch defense(it was also the theme of the minitournament, so it is very logical)} 4. d5 {Now he does something very uncommon. Until the previous move it is played nearly 500 times on GK, but nobody has played this move!! NOBODY out of nearly 500!! Maybe he wanted delete my pawn at e6, that was defending my pawn et f5?? Maybe he wanted to clean the board a little?? Maybe he did something?? Maybe it was a very smart move, maybe it was a blunder. I dont know exactly, to be honest. But it is curious, that nobody out of 500 did this, and he did.} exd5 {In every case, I take his pawn, I accept the offer.} 5. cxd5 {Of course he took my pawn back.} Bb4+ {Due to move 3 I have space to move my bishop out of the line. Now I attack the king, what nearly always is advantageful, I make possibilities to make the rochade, and I am more active now.} 6. Nc3 {He must move a piece between my bishop and his king, and in this way he is defending his paqn better too.} O-O {I use the possibilities I created a move ago and I make the rochade.} 7. Bd2 {Euh, I think he makes the defending of the king stronger and the defending of the knight too. And he could make the rochade, if he moved the queen too.} Qe7 {defending the bishop....} 8. g3 {to make space for the bishop....} Qc5 9. Bg2 {moving the bishop away to make possibilities for the rochade} Bxc3 {give a bishop for a knight.} 10. Bxc3 {of course he takes the knight back.} Nxd5 {attacks the bishop for the second time, for persuading him, that we can attack the king again, with the queen.} 11. Bd2 {the bishop is running away} Nc6 {That knight gives support to the other knight and the queen} 12. O-O {For the prevention, he makes the rochade.} f4 {give a pawn for a pawn and create more space on the board...} 13. Rc1 {attack the not defended queen} Qb5 {I run away with my queen} 14. Bc3 {The bishop comes back.} fxg3 {I take the paqn} 15. hxg3 {he takes the pawn back} Nxc3 {Take the bishop...} 16. Rxc3 {and give my knight} Qxb2 {take the undefended pawn and attack the now undefended rook.} 17. Ng5 {He forgets that the rook is undefended maybe and he is preparing an attack(which I didnt see that moment)} Qxc3 {Of course I take the undefended rook.} 18. Be4 {preparing the attack} g6 {trying to prevent the attack of the bishop} 19. Qd5+ {attack} Kg7 {of course running away with my king} 20. Kg2 {This must have a reason, but I dont know.} Nb4 {make a fork between queen and pawn} 21. Qa5 {defending the pawn and attacking the knight and make a penning(the dutch word, I dont know the english word) with the knight and the queen.} b6 {attacking the queen} 22. Qa4 {run away without loose the defending of the pawn and the attacking of the knight. Damagaful for him, he has loosed the penning.} d5 {attacking the bishop, which is frusttrating me} 23. Bf3 {he is running away, without loosing the defending of the knight.} Rf5 {attacking the knight and the bishop, however they both are defended, and make the rook active, and make a better defence of the king.} 24. a3 {the pawn who is long been under attack, is now running away and attacks my knight.} Nc6 {so I must run away} 25. Qh4 {Now he is preparing a great attack. It could be fatal for me. I let you see. Now first look good.} h6 {attacking the knight, to make he moves away} 26. Rh1 {more preparations for the big attack} h5 {make a better defence against the queen and the rook} 27. Bxh5 {this move is deleting his chanche to the win. I dont know anymore the possibilitie I saw that moment, but that moment I saw a possibilitie for him to win in a couple of moves. And by this move that possibilitie is deleted.} gxh5 {take the bishop back, material gain of 2} 28. Qxh5 {the queen takes the pawn back} Kf8 {run away with the king} 29. Nh7+ {attacks the king} Ke7 {run away} 30. Ng5 Qxa3 {I take the pawn} 31. Qh7+ {attacks my king} Kd8 {run away} 32. Nf7+ {attacks again} Rxf7 {I take the knight back} 33. Qxf7 {he takes my rook back, material loss of 2 points} Ne7 {preparation for my runaway in the next move, without this move he should mate me in the next move.} 34. Rh8+ {Look for a while. When I didnt move my knight in the previous move I had lost the game now. But I am very hurtable now.} Kd7 {The only possible move} 35. Qe8+ {attacks my king} Ke6 {running away} 36. Rh6+ {attacks again} Ke5 {running away again} 37. f4+ {attacks again, now gives the pawn support} Kd4 {running away for the very much th time} 38. Qh8+ {attacking again} Kc4 {running away, that is good for his condition, even for the king is running a sport that is good for your healthy :P} 39. Rh1 {I dont know exactly why this move} Bb7 {better defending of the bishop and the rook} 40. Qe5 {new attack, not on my king} d4+ {dont know anymore why I did} 41. e4 {dont know why} dxe3 e.p.+ {I take the pawn en passant and have a pawn that cant be tooken by other pawns(we call that a free pawn)} 42. Kg1 {I attacked him with the bishop and he is running away of course} Qc1+ {attacking him again and preparing checkmate. His only possibilitie is Kh2 and then I should do Qh1 and it is checkmate!! He saw that too, I think, for he resigned at this moment.}
