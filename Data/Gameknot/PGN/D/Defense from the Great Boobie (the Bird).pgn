1. e4 {The kings pawn! The most noble of minions!} c5 {However, Zakmo is versed in Corleone tactics! } 2. Nf3 {His horsy leaps into the battlefield, looking to steal the apples from my orchids!} d6 {My e5 orchid shall remain in my possession!} 3. Nc3 {His horsy's persist in trying to graze on my apple orchids! You shan't have my apples steed!} Bd7 {My army prepares themselves...} 4. d4 {And with the tenacity of a baby seal at the zoo near feeding time his queens pawn charges from his front line into my orchid!} cxd4 {Shy away from my apples you devilish rogue!} 5. Nxd4 {Alas his horsy leaps into the Orchid, eating my foot soldier and his apples... } Nc6 {My horsy shall not tolerate these shananigans, and leaps into the field, staring down the Great Boobie's horsy who meanwhile indulges himself in the d4 orchid...} 6. Bb5 {His pointy headed man with the cross sweeps in and stares down my grazing steed.} Nf6 {Too bad for him, i have TWO STEEDS!} 7. Bg5 {Hmmm... now both his pointy headed men with crosses are staring down my steeds. } e5 {HIYAHHH! And with the speed of an awakened three toed sloth, my kings pawn, the most noble of foot soldiers, dashes into the fray!} 8. Nf5 {Hmmm... } Bxf5 {And with the brutality of a floating dandelion, Frederick the 3rd and 1/2 sweeps away the horsy who tried grazing on the f5 square.} 9. exf5 {Now you have two minions on the f file and no center pawns to defend my horsy's from grazing!} Be7 {Frederick the third and other 1/2, grief stricken by the death of his brother Frederick the 3rd and 1/2, glides into play, relieving the queen from her duties of watching the horsy graze at f6.} 10. O-O {His king retreats into his lair...} a6 11. Ba4 O-O {And now my king does the same! However, my king has a pool table in his castle, complete with a ping pong table attachment!} 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 {Frederick the 3rd and 1/2 takes out the pointy headed man with the cross on his head, the one whom slayed the grazing horsy!} 13. Nd5 {GASP! His Horsy has found a prime spot to graze... it will be a hassle removing him from the d5 orchid...} Bg5 14. c3 Ne7 {An attempt to remove his horsy from my orchid!} 15. Bc2 Nxd5 16. Qxd5 {His horsy is gone! Alas, the evil succubus has reared her head!} Qb6 {However my queen isn't afraid! and glides gracefully to the b6 orchid, protecting the d6, b7 orchid as well as eying down the b2 orchid. So many apples being watched by one queen... Reinforcements seem necessary!} 17. b3 Rac8 18. c4 Rc5 {HAZAHH! Remove yourself from my land succubus!} 19. Qe4 Qc6 {My queen looks to do battle with the evil succubus! } 20. Qd3 {And she retreats with the fear in her eyes! Your debauchery shall not go unpunished succubus!} Rd8 {It is time for my queens pawn and kings pawn to reveal their strength, and march onward towards glory!} 21. Rad1 d5 22. Rfe1 f6 {In retrospect, i am wondering if Bf6 was a more solid plan of action in order to protect my foot soldiers...} 23. b4 {Forcing my stalwart of fortitude to fight, he advances his minion!} Rxc4 24. Bb3 Rc3 {I believe Rd4 was the more appropriate move...} 25. Bxd5+ {and now a match of tactics shall commence...} Kf8 26. Qe4 Qb5 27. Bc6 Rxd1 28. Bxb5 Rxe1+ 29. Qxe1 Rc1 30. Qxc1 Bxc1 {After much blood shed... only Frederick the third and other 1/2 and his opposing counterpart remain along with the noble king and his soldiers...} 31. Bd7 {His pointy headed man with the cross looks toward the c8 square in an attempt to slay my foot soldiers!} b6 {You SHAN'T HAVE MY SOLDIERS!} 32. a4 a5 33. bxa5 bxa5 {And with our minions closing in on each other, it is time! THE MOST NOBLE OF ALL WARRIORS WILL SOON TAKE FLIGHT!} 34. Kf1 Ke7 {And the kings look towards the middle of the board... ready to face each other in glorious battle!} 35. Be6 Kd6 36. Ke2 Kc5 37. Kd3 Bb2 38. h4 Bd4 {I believe the better move would have been Kb4...} 39. f3 {the battle seems drawn...} g6 40. g4 gxf5 41. Bxf5 h6 42. Bd7 Bb2 43. Ke4 Kd6 44. Bc8 Ke7 45. Kf5 Kf7 {It is evident that that war has reached a stalemate...} 46. h5 Kg7 47. Be6 Bc3 48. Ke4 Bd2 49. Kd5 Bc3 50. Kc4 Be1 51. Kb5 Bd2 52. Kc6 Be1 53. Kd5 Bd2 54. Ke4 Be1 55. Kf5 {After a long a brutal battle, both sides agreed to an end. It was a long and valiant war! one in which i feel zakmo kept pace with the Great Boobie...    On a serious note, i'm a much too inconsistent player to hang with stronger players so i feel this was quite the achievement to draw it out with a player of such caliber. I feel as though i had an advantage with those center pawns and i was hoping someone could assess my play here because i do feel like i let the win slip away from me. Thank you johnjarvinen for playing with me, i thought it was well played especially for a blitz game. }
