1. d4 Nf6 {A Team Match, my 100th win on GameKnot and my second game against this opponent. The first game was titled "A Little Less Careless" and is annotated on 4/09/2009. This time I'm black and play the Indian system against 1. d4. This game consumes 33 moves in a 45-day span and felt gruelingly slow. And when all the dust settled, this was the final game of the team match and the teams tied, 3-3.} 2. Bf4 c5 {I already have no idea what to make of this move. The GK DB simply calls it "Queen's Pawn Game" which is not very helpful. If that bishop had gone one more square to g5, this would be the Trompowski Attack. As is, I have no name for it. But GK DB says 2. ... c5 is a powerful reply, so there you have it.} 3. d5 Qb6 {Yep, I know. Weird. Feels weird. But she's attacking b2, so there's method to black's madness. I hope.} 4. Bc1 e6 {As Alice would say, curioser and curiouser.} 5. Nc3 Nxd5 6. Nxd5 exd5 {Let's let the two lovely ladies have their time alone in the spotlight.} 7. Qxd5 Nc6 {Black's pawn on d7 is horribly backward. Let's see if we can't find a better home for him. But first, a little developing.} 8. e3 d6 9. Bc4 Be6 {Uh uh, no free pawns for you! But, I believe there is free stuff here for black. 9. Bc4? was a blunder that will cost white his bishop.} 10. Qe4 Qb4+ 11. c3 Qxc4 12. Qxc4 Bxc4 {Trading queens when down by a piece may not be sound, especially when she's white's only active piece at the moment.} 13. b3 Ba6 {Centralizing might have been wiser, but I liked keeping white from castling. Even if it won't last.} 14. Nf3 Be7 15. c4 Nb4 {Yep, c4 was inevitable. Of course, black is about to win a pawn.} 16. O-O Bf6 17. Rb1 Nxa2 {Like that.} 18. Bb2 Bxb2 {White offers to trade more material, and black is more than willing.} 19. Rxb2 Nb4 20. Rd2 Ke7 {The goalie is out of the penalty box. But, someone had to protect that backward d-pawn.} 21. Ng5 d5 {The pawn on f4 is pinned, now seems a good time to unbackwardize the black d-pawn. I wonder if that's a word... In any case, this could be black's worst move of the game.} 22. Rfd1 f6 23. Nh3 dxc4 {Much agony over this one. Black opens the door and invites white in, and not in a Said-the-Spider-to-the-Fly kind of way, either. Nothing for it, the d-pawn dies horribly if black doesn't go for the pawn trade.} 24. Rd2d7+ Ke8 25. bxc4 g5 {Or 25. ... Bxc4 26. Rxb7. That line might have been better, getting the black bishop out into the game.} 26. f3 Nc2 {White undefended his e3 pawn, maybe he'll let me have it?} 27. Rc7 b6 28. Rdd7 Bc8 {Now this is downright ugly. Not one, but two white rooks on the 7th. White has, at the very least, a perpetual check if black doesn't stop it right now. Hence, 28. ... Bc8, creating a shelter for the black king on d8.} 29. Rde7+ Kd8 {Properly sheltered.} 30. Kf2 a5 {Time for a promotion. The white knight will race across the whole board to try to stop it.} 31. Ng1 a4 32. Ne2 a3 33. Nc3 a2 {Well, maybe no promotion. White will sac the knight to stop the promotion, black will capture the knight and enjoy a little harassment of the white king in the process. It's too late now for white to try Ra7, though that may have saved him a bit of grief if he had played it a move or two ago. In any case, white decided not to play on and tipped his virtual king.}
