1. e4 {This is an unrated game with Jo having some fun with the Damiano Defense (ironically named after the early master who condemned it). We have both played it at various times. The GK computer game analysis is here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17800417&rnd=0.025789561332767663} e5 2. Nf3 f6 {?! This move is playable and can be considered more of a psychological approach, since white has to be careful not to assume the defense just loses without effort. Bobby Fisher actually only got a draw in a simultaneous game as White from this position once and experts have gotten good games against unprepared White opponents from this position.} 3. Nxe5 {Safer is 3 Bc4 d6 4.d4 Nc6 5.c3... where Black has a difficult defense.} Qe7 {! Best. The Chigorin Variation. Taking the Knight instead loses after 4.Qh5+ Ke7 (4...g6 loses to 5.Qxe5+, forking king and rook) 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bc4+ d5! (6...Kg6?? 7. Qf5+ leads to mate) 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.h4 (8.d4? Bd6!) h5 9.Bxb7! Bd6 (9...Bxb7 10.Qf5+ Kh6 11.d4+ g5 12.Qf7! mates quickly) 10.Qa5! Nc6 11.Bxc6 Rb8, and now 12. Bxd7 Qxd7 13.Qxa7 leaves White with five extra pawns.} 4. Nf3 Qxe4+ {Consistent. The alternative 4...d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxe4+ 7 Be2 is playable but White retains an advantage. } 5. Be2 d5 6. Nc3 {Developing and attacking the Q. } Qe6 7. O-O {Now White is clearly better.} g6 {?? Black does not have time for this move. Instead Black should try ...Ne7! 8. Re1 Nbc6 9. Bd3 Qd7 10. Bb5 Kf7 11. Ba4 Qg4 12. h3 Qf4 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. d3, when White's advantage is evident but not fatal.} 8. Bc4 {Exploiting the e file. The Bishop can't be taken without losing the Q after Re1.} Ne7 9. Re1 {Hits the Q again, indirectly pinning the N.} dxc4 {?! Looking for complications. It is clear Black was in serious trouble if the Q moved.} 10. Rxe6 Bxe6 11. Qe2 {I like this move, but the GK computer considers the immediate Nd4 even stronger. In any case, Black is now lost.} Kf7 {? To protect the B and relieve the pin. But much better was … Bf7 12. Nb5 Na6 13. b3 cxb3 14. axb3 Kd7 15. Bb2 Bg7 16. Ng5 Bd5 17. c4 Nf5 18. cxd5 fxg5 19. Qe6+ Kd8 20. Bf6+ Bxf6 21. Qxf6+ Kd7} 12. Nd4 {! Now the Bishop needs to move, exposing the Black King. } Bd5 {?? Loses quickly, but after even … Bc8 13. Qxc4+ Kg7 14. Ndb5 Na6 15. Nxc7 Nxc7 16. Qxc7 Rg8 17. d4 Kh8 18. Ne4 Nd5 19. Qd8 f5 20. Qxd5 fxe4 21. Qxe4 Black is hopelessly lost.} 13. Nxd5 {Of course...} Nxd5 {Otherwise the piece is lost. } 14. Qe6+ {Wins the N, and after ...Kg7 15. Qxd5 Be7 16. Ne6+ Kh6 17. Qxb7 Nd7 18. Qxc7 Rhd8 19. d4+ g5 20. Nxd8 Rxd8 21. Be3 c3 22. Qxc3 Black has not point playing on. Thus Jo resigns.}
