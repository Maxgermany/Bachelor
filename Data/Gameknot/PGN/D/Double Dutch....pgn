1. d4 f5 {I give you the Dutch defense...} 2. c4 Nf6 {Playing Nf6, is all pretty standard, against Queens gambit... But I didn't play d5, yet...} 3. Nc3 d6 {This is all part of the setup...} 4. Bf4 {After Bg5, also g6...} g6 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. e3 {Consistent: after 6. Qb3 h6 7. e3 Nh5...} Nh5 {Not my usual play... But Bf4 prompted me, to change tactics...} 7. Bd3 {Or 7.

Nd5 Nc6 11. b4 {Not wise, but white is trying to make play... However, after 11. Ng5 e5! 12. 0-0 h6, and after temporizing with 11. 0-0 0-0 12.
