[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {I've started to prefer this move over d4 since its tactical and often more fun than the slower moving d4.  However d4 is very solid and I would say lately it even challenges this move for being the best by test.} e5 {Classical response.} 2. Nf3 d6 {I find this move a less appealing than Nc6 because it inhibits the development of the dsb.} 3. d4 {Attacking the center and honestly I'm out of my opening book here :) but its fun to experiment.} Bg4 {Threatening to break open my king side with exd4.} 4. Bc4 {Indirectly protecting the d4 pawn and threating Bxf7+.} Nf6 {Defends my threat and threatens e4 as well as breaking open my king side again since Qxf3 no longer threatens mate.  I make a the decision here that having my kingside broken up isn't really an issue since having the half open g-file should make up for the doubled pawns.  Therefore I simple defend my e4 pawn. } 5. Nc3 c6 {I think this is a structurally dubious since I think it would be wiser for black to leave his castling options open on the queen side as my attack is going to be coming king side.  Also his pieces and structure dictate his play is on the king side as well.  Think Nc6 would have been much better.} 6. Bg5 {Developing my last minor piece this also makes d5 or exd5 have more option for white.  I think d5 dxe5 dxc4 Qxd8+ Kxd8 exf6 is rather interesting. } Be7 {With this move its time to release the tension on d4 since it comes with a surprising complication.} 7. dxe5 {Best move here is the in-between move Bxf3.  Qxf3 dxe5 Rd1 Qc2 where white has a small edge.} dxe5 {? loses two pawns to a very complex line.  } 8. Qxd8+ {Move one.} Bxd8 {Kxd8? Nxe5 beside black keep the ability to castle at least for now anyway.} 9. Bxf7+ {!} Kxf7 {Most likely best Nxe5 is next anyway.} 10. Nxe5+ Ke6 {Best move because it centralizes the king for the endgame.} 11. Bxf6 {Only way to keep the advantage.} Bxf6 {Bh5 Bxd8.} 12. Nxg4 Bxc3+ {Doubles pawns and the only way to keep in the game.} 13. bxc3 Nd7 {Getting the knight out.} 14. O-O-O {grabbing the open file and adding defense to my weakened pawns.} h5 {Forces the knight to retreat.} 15. Ne3 Nf6 {attacks e4.  Think Nc5 would have been better focusing on my weak pawns.} 16. f3 {defends e4.} b5 {Doesn't really stop c4...} 17. Rd3 {Doubling on the d-file.} a5 18. Rhd1 Rac8 {defending against Rd6+.} 19. a3 {Stops b4.} Ke5 {grabbing space.} 20. c4 Kf4 {? not sure what this move was for but now it gives white a way to force a trade.} 21. cxb5 cxb5 22. Nd5+ {forcing the knight trade.} Nxd5 23. Rd3xd5 Rcb8 {?? invites mate.} 24. Rd1d3 {mate in one. Rf5 and g3 both mate.  Black resigns.}
