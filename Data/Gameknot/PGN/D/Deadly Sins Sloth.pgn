[Opening "Latvian (C40), Fraser defence"]

1. e4 {Today we get to see what happens when you don't make a simple safety check before each and every move! Especially in a long format like here on GK where you have plenty of time for each move, there's no reason to have to rely on your calculations from a move ago--check again! In this game, I miss a couple of simple tactics and pay for it dearly. Enjoy!} e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The fun but dubious Latvian Gambit. I have a large number of annotations that go into more detail about this opening, so I won't cover it in-depth here.} 3. Nxe5 {This is the main line.} Nc6 {?! The Fraser Variation. More common are 3...Qf6 or 3...Nf6.} 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Nxc6 {?! Unusual. At this point it's usually better for White to simply win the Rook and then ride out whatever attack Black can produce, ie. after 5.Nxg6 Nf6 6.Qh3 hxg6 7.Qxh8 Qe7.} dxc6 6. Qf3 Nf6 7. Bd3 {?! Preparing to castle as well as putting pressure on f5. White doesn't want to allow Black to develop his Bishops with tempo (ie. 7.exf5? Bxf5), for sure, though this move also stifles White's own DSB. I think 7.Nc3 or 7.d3 would have been simpler here.} Qe7 8. O-O Nxe4 {? I thought a while about this one and ultimately I think I made the wrong choice. The trade is even materially, but it releases the tension and frees White's pieces while creating some problems for Black. 8...Bd7 was better, preparing for queenside castling.} 9. Re1 Be6 10. Bxe4 fxe4 11. Rxe4 O-O-O {White is behind in development for now, but his Rook and Queen are far better than any of Black's forces.} 12. Re1 {I think 12.Qe3 would have been a stronger alternative. This allows potential tactics down the e-file for Black. Obviously something had to be done to prevent ...Bd5, winning, but this move was needlessly passive in my opinion. Also good were 12.Nc3 or even better, 12.c4.} Bg7 13. Nc3 Qd6 14. d3 Rhf8 {White continues his development while Black struggles to put an attack together before White can consolidate. At this move, I foresaw what I thought was a strong combination to blast open the WK.} 15. Qe3 Rxf2 {?? No safety check. The idea is that White cannot retake on f2 because of 16...Bd4! and Black will give a Rook and Bishop for a Queen and pawn, the initiative, and vastly superior activity, but I overlooked a critical intermezzo, which would have been easy to catch if I'd only looked... Not to mention that 16.Qxf2 Bd4 17.Be3 Rf8 just loses a piece anyway, for basically no compensation (good catch tiger_lilov)} 16. Qxe6+ {! White simply wins a piece for my troubles.} Qxe6 17. Rxe6 Bd4 18. Be3 Rxc2 {?! Black must make the absolute most of his 2nd-rank Rook if he is to stay in the game. He still has a slight advantage in activity, but this move gives up his initiative--I think 18...Bxe3 19.Rxe3 Rxc2 20.Rb1 Rd2 would have been much better.} 19. Bxd4 Rxd4 20. Ne4 Rxd3 {Despite the error a few moves back, Black still has a bit of a chance thanks to his powerful Rooks.} 21. Re7 {! White locks the BK out (for now, though of course he can eventually bring himself to bear via ...b6, Kb7-a6-b5 etc) and places his own Rook on the seventh rank, choosing aggressive trades rather than passive defense, which is always the correct choice when slightly ahead in a Rook endgame. White also sets a trap...} Re3 {?? The prospect of a "free" piece baits me, and again I'm too lazy to make a simple safety check. To lose now, White would have to blunder badly. Much better was 21...Rxb2 22.Rxh7 Re3 23.Rf1 b6.} 22. Nd6+ {! White continues to play accurately.} cxd6 23. Rxe3 Rxb2 24. Re7 d5 {Black has two passed, connected center pawns, but cannot get his King to them. White should not lose from this point, as long as he plays correctly. I will only make a few more comments.} 25. Rf1 Kd8 26. Rxh7 Re2 27. Rf8+ Re8 28. Rff7 g5 {? Not a useful move. Black might as well try to prepare for pushing his center pawns, with 28...b6.} 29. Rfxb7 Kc8 30. Rbxa7 Kb8 31. a4 {31.Rac7 was better, picking off Black's final chance at holding (Black cannot defend the pawn at all: 31...Rc8?? 32.Rb7+ Ka8 33.Ra7+ Kb8 34.Rhb7#).} d4 32. Rad7 {White actually plays very inaccurately here and for the next several moves, but never badly enough to lose. The c-pawn was still the correct target, not the d-pawn.} c5 33. Rdc7 d3 34. Rcd7 c4 35. Rd4 Rc8 36. Rdd7 Re8 {The BR cannot stay on c8 of course.} 37. Kf1 g4 38. a5 Ka8 39. a6 Kb8 40. a7+ Ka8 41. g3 {Much stronger was 41.Rb7! d2 42.Rb8+ Rxb8 43.axb8=Q+ Kxb8 44.Ke2 c3 45.Kd1!} Rc8 42. Rdc7 Rxc7 43. Rxc7 d2 44. Ke2 c3 45. Rxc3 {This is best. Now it's a simple KR-K mate.} Kxa7 46. Kxd2 Kb6 47. Kd3 Kb5 48. Kd4 Kb4 49. Rc1 Kb5 50. Rc2 Kb6 51. Kd5 Kb7 52. Kd6 Kb8 53. Kd7 Kb7 54. Rb2+ Ka6 55. Kc6 Ka5 56. Rb8 Ka4 57. Kc5 Ka3 58. Kc4 Ka2 59. Kc3 Ka1 60. Kc2 Ka2 61. Ra8# {Hope you enjoyed it! Learn from my failures--look out every move for tactics you might have missed a move ago! Comments are most welcome; thanks for reading!}
