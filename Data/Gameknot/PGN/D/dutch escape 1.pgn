1. d4 {oh goody, my favourite... because i can play...} f5 {dutch! when i first analysed this defense, i couldn't believe black could castle safely behind what appeared to be a mess... as it is, i seem to have a lot of success with dutch...} 2. Bf4 {developing the bishop... personally, i find the most annoying move from black's point of view to be 2. Bg5, as it immediately threatens a doubled pawn if i play 2... Nf6} Nf6 {naturally... i've got clear control of e4} 3. c4 {! when my opponent develops the knight in front of the pawn on c2, i feel i already have a huge advantage... with c4,  white controls the queenside and the centre except for e4... } g6 {leningrad... prepares Bg7 and 0-0 with an eye towards the kingside pawn assault... this is what i considered a mess when i first saw it...} 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. Nf3 d6 {i played this move later than i usually do... } 6. g3 {g3... now, the database suggests this is strong for white, but i've always found it to be a disadvantage for white, as it commits a pawn, and his bishop is committed to defend... maybe i just get lucky...} c6 {a vital move for me... stops the knight coming in, in particular after Qe8} 7. Bg2 O-O 8. O-O {i felt comfortable at this stage... i've been here many times before and know i can find winning attacks...} h6 {to control g5...} 9. Qd2 {attacking h6} Kh7 {an opportunity to move my king off the weak g8 square...} 10. Rfe1 Qe8 {?! i hope to get my queen to g6 or h5 long before he's opened the e-file... still, living dangerously here...} 11. e4 {no surprises here...} g5 {i was worried about a bishop sac here, as it would yield two kingside pawns and a strong knight, which would no doubt be looking to eventually move on to the even stronger square of e6... but i did not expect what he played...} 12. e5 {!} dxe5 {forced, i felt... } 13. Bxe5 Qg6 {? a mistake... } 14. Bxb8 {which he exploits... my only consolation was he has now lost his attacking bishop for my undeveloped knight...} Rxb8 15. Rxe7 {and now his rook is pinning my bishop and he will surely double them up... but, more worryingly, he can pass a pawn on the d-file...} Nh5 {further attack his kingside while opening up my bishop...} 16. Rae1 {at this stage i felt i was lost...} Kh8 {of course, to unpin...} 17. d5 {ominous...} Bf6 {i was not comfortable with his rook on my second rank...} 18. Re7e2 g4 {it's all out attack now... } 19. Ne5 {it was invited, i guess...} Qg7 20. d6 {obviously, a strong move... } Bg5 {clutching at straws now...} 21. Qd4 {and that i didn't like... } Bf6 22. Qd3 Rg8 {load up on the g file...} 23. d7 {! and this was inevitable... i could've played Be6 earlier to defend this, but that just invites the discovered attack, which would win another pawn and he'd still have his passed pawn... it was clear to me that sooner or later i was going to have to lose a piece to defend against this pesky pawn, so best to avoid future complications and accept the inevitable...} Bxd7 24. Nxd7 {? i felt he should've took with his queen, as a trade off of heavy pieces would suit him, not me... but instead he allows me to pin his knight...} Rbd8 25. Rd1 {logical, since it's protected by the knight... 25. Rd2 would've tied his queen down...} f4 {! a strong move... he can't take or Nxf4 wins rook, and if he allows the advance i win bishop...} 26. Qf5 {! a good response... attacks the knight, preventing f3 winning anything for now, and exerts pressure on f4... also puts more pressure on the bishop, and unpins the knight, while maintaining support for him...} Bg5 {my opponent acknowledged this as a good move, but being honest i felt it was forced... i guess it is an effective move, as it defends all attacks, and let's not forget i still threaten f3... but it wasn't like i had a multitude of options...} 27. Be4 {thwarts my threat, and supports the queen, but leaves a gaping hole in his kingside... i felt i had to try to take advantage of that now, or my inferior position would crumble very soon, with my resignation to follow... } b5 {! the move that turned the match... such a subtle move, but crucial... interestingly, he offered me a draw here... i honestly don't know if he realised what i was up to, or if it was an act of ensuring his safe passage to the next round... i suspect the latter, simply because he makes an error soon...} 28. cxb5 {...} cxb5 {...} 29. Nxb5 {? and here's the error... the move he should've played was b4, to prevent me moving his knight... as it is, he took the bait, moved his knight anyway, and now his knight on d7 is pinned again... there is hope...} Rgf8 {and the reason i wanted his knight pinned... i was expecting Qxg4, but i felt it was a necessary move, as my queen is tied to preventing mate...  i would never in a million years have expected him to play what he did...} 30. Qh7+ {? at first, i thought it was brilliant... but it's a glaring error that costs him the win...} Qxh7 {forced} 31. Bxh7 {and now if i take the bishop, Nxf8 is game over... a successful queen trade?} Rf7 {! no... his knight is still pinned, and now attacked twice, with his bishop also under threat... he must lose a piece...} 32. Bg6 {futile, really... } Rfxd7 {he can't take the knight or Rxd1 mates in two...} 33. Rxd7 {sensible... he's still ahead on material...} Rxd7 {i still threaten mate... but still, one would imagine i have only salvaged the draw i declined earlier... at best...} 34. gxf4 {?? and it's game over... he's cracked under the pressure...} Rd1+ {happily i galavant around like i've gotten away with murder... i must confess, i didn't initially see the mate here, i played this for the fork next go to win the rook and edge ahead... it was only when he moved i saw the correct path...} 35. Kg2 {Re1 is futile... now i realise he can only move to g3 when checked next, and is then out of squares...} Nxf4+ 36. Kg3 Rg1# {and i fluke a vital win... not the best of games in terms of errors... we both played badly at times, and well at other times... but an enjoyable game nonetheless... and this win most certainly restored my faith in the dutch opening... ok, it can leave you wide open if you make the smallest of mistakes, but there are always dangerous attacking options...}
