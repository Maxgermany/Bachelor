1. d4 f5 {Dutch defence, which is what I have picked up against d4 openings, but only played a handful of games with it yet. Gaining experience with new openings on gameknot is nice, as you both have time to analyze, and the opportunity to consult game databases for similar positions in master games.} 2. c4 Nf6 3. f3 g6 4. Nh3 Bg7 5. b4 {White has grabbed a lot of space and is threatening to overwhelm me with a pawn storm on the queen side. I'd fallen for this in a blitz game before and was at lack for a strategy to meet it. As white has almost exclusively moved pawns yet, we are out of the opening books. I searched master game databases for similar pawn structures an found a reply I liked} c6 6. e3 a5 {That's it. If white advances the b pawn, then cxb5. If not, axb4.} 7. b5 cxb5 8. cxb5 a4 9. Na3 O-O {Finally found the time to castle. Because of white's aggressive pawn activity it was hard to do it before.} 10. g4 {?} fxg4 {Opening a file for the rook, and breaking up white's pawn structure in 3 islands.} 11. fxg4 d5 {Defending against Bc4 , and preparing e4 as an outpost square for the knight.} 12. Be2 Ne4 13. Bb2 {White has several unprotected pieces here. The bishop on b2, the pawn on e3 and the knight on h3. Initially I couldn't find a good way to exploit it, although I spent quite some time in the analyzis board. Then found the following combination.} e5 {The Queen threatens 14... Qg4  Nf2 15. Qxf2#. The e4 knight and the g8 rook blocks the escape squares for the white king. Tactics for avoiding it loses for white as well. 14. Bf1 Qh4  15. Ke2 Bxg4, and white lose the queen to a royal skewer. 14. Nf2 Nxf2 forks the rook and queen. } 14. dxe5 {It turns out white didn't see the danger at all.} Qh4+ 15. Nf2 Qxf2# {And mate.}
