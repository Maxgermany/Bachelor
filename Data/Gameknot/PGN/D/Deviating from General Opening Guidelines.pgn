1. d4 {Before that happened, it started with this.  I am not surprised because I know him, and my opponent likes to open with the QP.} d5 {I think that better was to play the most common move in the world database, after discussion in the Chicoboy's Legacy Consultation Game.  However, I am only familiar with the variations, as white because of the fact that I was able to play the Colle System against Bert.  But, I asked what would happen, if white was able to play this against me.  I just didn't want to get into complications, so I followed GM Susan Polgar's advise and played what I was most comfortable with.} 2. c4 {I am not surprised that he likes the QG and, I seem to remember that he played this before.} c6 {I really evaluated on this, or 2...e6  The most common is advancing the e pawn, but the problem is that I didn't want to get left with a bad bishop.  While ...e6 makes my DSB stronger, my LSB is weaker.  But, I think that was the better alternative, as now, my DSB is blocked in, making it much more difficult to get it into play and castle.} 3. Nf3 {Standard development.} Nf6 {But, I copy that because my goal is to get my DSB into play and castle.} 4. Nc3 {I am very surprised to see this move because they say that one should not play Nc3 in QP openings, until that c pawn has been exchanged.  It was too soon to conclude, but I thought that with this move, I might have an advantage here.  But, I wasn't going to count on my chickens before they hatch.  The idea being is because of what I remembered from tactical-abyss in his Q sacs (which I do intend to annotate, at some point.  It would be epic because that win, in regards to the same thing was someone of about his strength, believe it or not.)  But, the lesson was not to become overconfident and play carefully.  For now, I will, until I see an opportunity, which is when things will go downhill.  However, I should not be surprised because his c pawn had advanced first because the one thing that I forgot was that 2.c4 was played due to being a QG.  } g6 {Trying to take advantage of what I had viewed as an inaccuracy, I decided to fianchetto.  I also thought about the possibility of advancing my center with the idea of developing another piece.  But, the idea behind it was to pin his N on c3.  After using analyze the board, as well as, visualization (which I noted in the intro) I decided that this was a bad idea.  The idea being that if I had done that with ...Bb4, he has Qa4+, after which, I'd lose my DSB without compensation.} 5. e3 {Developing a central pawn and strengthening his LSB (in other words, that's now his good bishop.)  The only issue is that his DSB becomes the bad bishop, in return.  As white, I think I would've fianchettoed my LSB, in this position.  Yet, he has ways to compensate.} Bh6 {I had a tough time deciding between this move and 5...Bg7  But, given that I'd be faced with an interference (where my piece is blocked by another piece) I decided not to do that.  I have been reperimended for, voluntarily, blocking in my own pieces after a fianchetto.  That happened in a mentoring game with myevilluck.  And, given that I remember this from over 3 years shows that near pictogram memory.  So, I asked myself, as Homework, why have ya piece blocked in by another of mine, when instead, I can have it on a different flank, where it's not blocked, at all.} 6. Bd3 {Waisting no time, not only does he develop, but in doing so, white is strengthening his bad bishop.  That's one way I realized that he could compensate.  In addition, given that he's a much stronger player, I knew that he find the way to do so, quickly.} O-O {?! Waisting no time at all, I castle, immediately.  Don't forget, where still blending in my typical style (with the idea of making him feel comfortable and confident.  In fact, I want him to do so much of it, that he is taken off guard when I play something different.)  Though, the plan will backfire, at some point.  Now, I thought that it wouldn't completely, but I didn't think that the reversed would happen to me.  In addition, I'm not sure what the best move was, but for the reason that charleshiggie notated in a previous annotation, I view it as a slight inaccuracy.  The reason being, like with that game, this will give white better center control with this move.} 7. e4 {Once he played, I realize that I had no choice, but to exchange B's, with this being my good bishop for his bad one.  I don't like the situation, at all, and asked myself if there was a better alternative.  But, after further analysis, I realize that there was no other alternative but to do this, lest, I lose a piece (which is not an option.)} Bxc1 8. Rxc1 {After this, however, I have no problem going into an exchange.  I'm just not sure if it's quite the right choice.  Though, at the time, I thought it was because I remember Jack telling me that it's often a good idea to exchange often against opponents, whose ratings are much strongers.  But, that was before cplusplus11 said that it all depends what pieces you are exchanging and they're value, compared to, your value.  In it, he noted, "They need to be equal exchanges. If you keep exchanging your good pieces for your opponent's bad pieces, then when you offer to trade your bad piece for their good one, they just decline and they win easily because they have better pieces."  I'm afraid, however, that they were not equal here as I wound up giving him some of my better for his that were not as good.  } dxe4 9. Nxe4 Nxe4 10. Bxe4 Qa5+ {Knowing that, this is where I felt that it was safe to deviate from The General Opening Guidelines of completing development.  And, yes, it's also where I do things differently then what he's used to.  And, in doing so, I thought I had taken him, offguard.  This is no cheapo tactic or attempted mate.  But, what I didn't realize is that, what I thought was Real Chess, is actually unsound, and therefore, Hope Chess.  The reason I played is because of what's about to happen.  The idea being that I'm bound to win a pawn here.  In doing so, however, he will be able to prevent me from completing my development, which I did not want.  And, from there, things will go downhill.  It's about pattern recognition which is my trouble spot and another reason that I do the sophisticated Homework of visualization.  But, it's still a weakness which I'm bound to discover.} 11. Rc3 {This move took me surprise.  Instead, I thought, he'd get out of check by moving the K.  And, even if one loses castling rights, as I've learned, there are ways to compensate.  But, it would take three moves, as opposed to, one.  This can be done by bringing the K to e2, then the R to e1, followed by the monarch on f1.  And, then, it's, as though, you castled K side, with the same results.  But, this move, however, leaves his R pinned, and I didn't think that white would want to be put in this situation.  No matter what he played, I would've taken on a2.  But, as noted, I will up in trouble because of this.} Qxa2 12. Qc1 {I anticipated this move, but only under the technicality that he is protecting b2.  However, there is much more to this then meets the eye, as we're about to see.  } Qa5 {Due to being a pawn down, I considered other alternatives, until it boiled down to two candidate moves.  They were, what I play next, (which I figured I'd do a move later), or 12...Bf5 with the idea of exchanging.  The reason being was to go back to development.  But, it also goes with a general fact that when you're ahead, it's usually to your benefit to exchange pieces.  However, this is a time where visualization wasn't going to cut the mustard which is also why I use analyze the board.  And, in this case, that doesn't work because if I had played 12...Bf5, he would've won my Q (in return) after 13.Ra3, as it would be trapped.  This is also why he played 12.Qc1  The idea being before that, had I taken (without the move played), I'd be safe.  But, now, after 13.Ra3, his Queen would've prevented mine from escaping because it can recapture, if I took.} 13. O-O {Therefore, white waists no time in getting his K to safety.} c5 {The plan being to exchange, as his is a center pawn.  So, if I could force the exchange, I'd compensate for the loss of center control.} 14. Qh6 {But, white doesn't allow it.} f6 {I also considered 14...f5 with the idea of getting tempo, in return.  In addition, 14...Bf5 also came to mind with the idea of continuing development.  But, after evaluation, I realized that those were out of questions.  In fact, this is indirectly forced because anything else allows 15.Ng5, in which he would mate with 16.Qxh7# which I was not going to allow.  And, since I have studied a similar position with Jack Stockel (which he made do as Homework); as well as, insights on tactics from GM Susan Polgar, I knew what had to be done.  So, this was, already, second nature. } 15. Bxg6 {From studying TA's Q sac, and a few losses prior, I realized that white wouldn't just give away his B.  And, if he did, it would come at a price.  So, asked myself, if there was an alternative to this.  However, there was not because, had I not taken, white would've mated with 16.Qxh7#  I was familiar with this kind of mate since easy19 mated me in the same way.  In return, I used this same thing, when mating reachforgoals (which helped me become, somewhat, well known for teaching chess.)  Therefore, taking his B was not an option.} hxg6 {Now, one would think that I have a win.  But, from what I noted earlier, about why they give things, I wasn't confident.  In fact, I knew, otherwise.  In other words, I'm well aware of the fact that I'm big trouble, and likely, lost.  So, I'm doing what I can to stay in and will continue putting up a fight, until I'm 100% confident that it's lost.  But, as we're about to see, this isn't far away.} 16. Qxg6+ {So, he knabs a pawn and, (in the process), places me in check.} Kh8 {Forced.} 17. Re3 {When he played this, I knew that e7 was en-prise, so I asked myself what could be done to protect this.  The only choice to protect this, without losing a piece was my next move.  However, the game is lost either way.  But, slightly better was allowing him to take because I would've lasted longer against the mate.  If 18.Rxe7, Rf7 then comes 19.Qxf7, or 19.Rxf7, and white would mate with 20.Re8# or 20.Qf8#  But, with what I play next, white will mate a move earlier.} e6 18. Re4 {I figured out all of the facts when white moved here. At first, I wasn't sure why he played this, and before doing Homework, the hypothesis was that he wanted my e pawn.  That, however, is ludicrous because after the evaluation, I figured out that I'd take back.  The real reason he played this was because, had his R remained on e3, white wouldn't have been able to do damage.  But, with this move, however, it is now an official mate.  The reason being is that my K is pinned, and in order to prevent, it would have to escape.  Given that my monarch, 19.Rh4# is inevitable.  Therefore, I resigned.  What I learned is that, only under certain circumstances should you deviate from the guidelines.  There are exceptions, but it's important to know when they exist.  I'd say, given my loss against nambam, that against stronger players, like bhidragon, in general, unless your preventing the loss of material, it's not a good idea to deviate.  If it's to win a pawn, the opponent might also be giving it for tactic.  In this case, white did because when I captured it, he prevented from, not only completing development, but also, deploying another piece.  From there, things went downhill.}
