1. c4 g6 2. Nf3 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. g3 Nc6 5. Bg2 e5 6. d3 Nf6 7. O-O O-O 8. Ne1 {This backward-seeming sortie, which will eventually post the Knight to support the advance of White's Q-side pawns, initiates what has become one of my stock strategic themes in the English. ...Great. Now I'm giving away my secrets!  ;-)} Bd7 9. Nc2 Qc8 10. e4 Ne7 {Black wisely guards d5, with ...c6 if White waits to play his Knight there. I was formulating a different plan, however, one to expand on the Q-side.} 11. b4 Bh3 12. Be3 Bxg2 13. Kxg2 c6 14. Rb1 d5 15. Bc5 {Well, that has to be annoying. Now there's no fork on d4, and the Knight is in need of protecting.} Qd7 16. Qe2 {Holds e4 and c4, and, if Black trades a pawn on either square, opens the d-file to the advantage of White's heavy pieces not Black's.} d4 17. Na4 {My original idea was to play the steed to b2 after 17. ...b5!  18. cb5 cb5  19. Nb2 when now it's the c-file that opens with sharp play that probably favors Black slightly. Instead my opponent played the stereotypical ...} b6 18. Bxb6 {!? -- This somewhat Tal-like speculative sac is certainly worth exploring, in my opinion. Not only does White end up with a 7 to 6 point advantage (meh) but more importantly he gains what must soon turn into a pair of connected passers on the a- and b-files, with Rooks to back their advance. The obvious capture 18. Be7 is certainly sound but humdrum. Tal once quipped, "Other chessplayers will sacrifice when they see it is to their advantage to do so. I will sacrifice when I see it is not to my disadvantage." Often the Wizard of Riga, the great tactical master, would sacrifice a couple pawns or a piece just to introduce an element of sheer chaos into the game, trusting that his own judgment was more reliable than his opponent's would be during the ensuing complications. Sometimes that backfired on him. More often it did not. But whatever the outcome it always made for exciting chess. Here I make the sac because "... I see it is not to my disadvantage."} axb6 19. Nxb6 Qa7 20. Nxa8 Rxa8 21. Rb2 {It turns out White's Knight could not be more perfectly placed for the defense. White will be completely helpless to stop the pawns from advancing except by turning his Queen into a blockading piece - not a happy prospect.} Bh6 {Desperately seeking counterplay already.} 22. Ra1 Qd7 23. a4 Ng4 24. a5 f5 25. h3 {On Black's previous move I was a little reluctant to play to h3 on the suspicion that Black might try the desperado ...Nf2 with possible Queen penetration and annoying checks. After the Black's 24th move, however, his Queen is no longer threatening h3.} Nf6 26. exf5 Qxf5 27. b5 {! -- A move which joins the a and b pawns forcefully while opening previously closed lines, namely the h1-a8 diagonal.} c5 28. Qf3 {!! -- The killer. Black is now forced to drop his Rook or a Knight, or trade Queens, and there's just no healthy way to swap ladies.} e4 29. Qxf5 gxf5 30. dxe4 fxe4 {Black cannot make his center pawns as good as White's Q-side ones: the White King is too close.} 31. a6 d3 32. Ne3 Bxe3 33. fxe3 Nf5 34. Kf2 Nd6 35. b6 {!! -- The Rook at b2 is no longer needed.} Nxc4 36. a7 {! -- Ensuring a new Queen.} Nxb2 37. b7 Rf8 38. b8=Q Ng4+ 39. Ke1 Nxe3 40. Qxf8+ {Naturally. Brutal simplification.} Kxf8 41. a8=Q+ Kf7 42. Ra7+ Kf6 43. Qh8+ Ke6 44. Qxb2 d2+ {One last trick: if 45. Kd2 Nc4, even though that's hopeless too.} 45. Qxd2 {And, out of options on the board, Black resigns.}
