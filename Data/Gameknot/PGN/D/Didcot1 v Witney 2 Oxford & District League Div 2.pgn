1. e4 {A crucial win from last week's match, which helped take us to the top of the table.  I gained a crushing grip at the end of the opening, which I maintained through the middle game, but then lost my way in trying to force the win with a king chase when swapping off to capitalise on my material advantage would have won more easily.} c5 2. Nf3 g6 {An Accelerated Dragon, not something I've met often.  I've got a book on it somewhere but I don't remember anything about it!} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Bg7 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 {I like to play this before Black can defend with a piece to give Black an isolated a-pawn , which is, potentially, a weakness but can also become a remote passer if not watched properly.} bxc6 7. Bc4 e6 8. O-O Ne7 9. Bg5 {Playing simple, direct, chess, I'm trying to make Black's development as awkward as possible.  This pin starts to keep Black tied up as, if his Q moves, the K is tied to defending it.If he castles, his Q can't move and neither can the N.  I was hoping maybe to provoke ...f6, weakening the K's defence.} d5 {This looks like a freeing move but doesn't quite succeed.} 10. exd5 cxd5 11. Bb5+ {My bishops operate a pincer movement on the uncastled K's position.} Bd7 12. Re1 {Occupying the half-open e-file and setting up potential pins that could lead to gain of material.} Bxc3 {?  I think this was the losing move as it surrendered the open black diagonals to by B and Q.  Patrick also thought it had been a mistake when we chatted afterwards.  The motivation behind it was obviously to give me weak isolated doubled pawns but Black never got to exploit them.} 13. Bxd7+ {The B, no longer defended by the N, had to swap quickly before I could recapture on c3.} Qxd7 14. bxc3 Rc8 15. Qd4 {! This defends the pawn and attacks the R on h8, denying Black the chance to castle.  It also allows me quickly to centralise my other rook.} Rg8 16. Rad1 Rc4 17. Qf6 Nc6 {Black appears to be freeing himself up, possibly preparing to advance his d-pawn but he has to watch out for mate threats.} 18. Rd3 {This frees my Q from the duty of defending c3, while also preparing to double rooks or perhaps swing across to attack the h-pawn.} Qe7 {? Now the e-pawn is pinned against the Q rather than the K and the d-pawn has no other defender,so ...} 19. Rxd5 Qxf6 20. Bxf6 {After a short middle game, we now move into a long end game, with a slight advantage to me at this point.} Ne7 21. Ra5 {? I soon felt that this was a mistake, allowing Black to escape his bonds.} Rc7 22. Rd1 {Looking at a potential mate on d8, but Black's natural reply covers that square as well as defending the a-pawn again and attacking my Ra5.  He also has another reply that I hadn't fully considered ...} Nd5 {Forks c3 and f6.  If I don't do something effective soon, he will free up his Rg8 and equalise.} 23. Be5 Rb7 24. c4 Nb4 {Black attacks c2 but I'm more concerned with tying him up ...} 25. Bf6 {Re-establishing the bind and threatening mate.} Nc6 26. Rc5 Rd7 {In turn, Black threatens mate in 1.} 27. Re1 Ne7 {Now he's back in his box I start to feel better again.} 28. Rb1 {Going after a back rank check to win the Rg8 in due course.  I was about half an hour up on the clock now and maintained that till the end.} Rd2 {Black played this with a look that said he'd more or less given up hope and was just trying to create complications.} 29. g3 {Creating my bolt hole.  Now the back rank threat is more real.} Nf5 {? This N was defending the Rg8.} 30. Rc8+ Kd7 31. Rxg8 {6 points and half an hour up, the win should be easy now.  My watching colleagues were expecting me to force swaps and quickly exploit the extra material.  I became obsessed with a king hunt which proved none too easy ...} Rxc2 32. Rd8+ Kc6 33. Rbb8 Rxa2 34. Rbc8+ Kb7 35. Rcb8+ Kc6 {Blck unsurprisingly tries to draw by repetition.} 36. g4 {The N was controlling 3  squares I wanted to use for my hunt.} Nd6 37. Be5 Nxc4 {Now I'm only 3 points up and that a-pawn is looking potentially dangerous.} 38. Rbc8+ Kb5 39. Bd4 Nd2 40. Rc5+ Ka4 41. Bc3 Nb1 42. Rd4+ Kb3 43. Rb4+ Kc2 44. Bd4+ Kd3 45. Bf6 Nd2 46. Rc3+ Ke2 47. Re3+ Kd1 48. Rd4 Kc1 49. Red3 h6 50. Rd4d7 a5 51. Rc7+ Rc2 {and now all the spectators were silently screaming for me to swap on c2...} 52. Ra7 {? but no, I stubbornly kept the rooks on in my search for mate, pausing at least to guard against Black queening easily.} Ra2 53. Bc3 Ne4 54. Bd4 {defending f2} a4 55. Rc7+ Rc2 56. Be3+ Nd2 57. Bxd2+ {and, with 33 seconds remaining on his clock and 6 points behind once more, Black finally resigned.  }
