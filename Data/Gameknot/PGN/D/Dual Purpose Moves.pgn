1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 c6 4. d4 {I decide on a bold strike to the center.} Qc7 5. d5 h6 6. dxc6 {I hoped the black queen or knight would capture the pawn so I could follow with Bb5 to pin the piece against the king.} bxc6 {But black did not oblige with Qc6 but instead took pawn to pawn. I expected black to respond with Ne6 to move the knight to where it could project power into the center of the board.} 7. Be2 {Getting ready to castle.} Be7 {Looks like black is getting ready to castle too.} 8. O-O Nd7 9. a3 Nb6 10. Be3 Be6 11. b4 {I know this leaves the knight on c3 vulnerable to a queen attack, but I plan to move that knight to a4 when that square is safe.} a6 12. Bxb6 Qxb6 13. Na4 {Now it's safe to advance the knight to a4.} Qb7 14. c4 Rd8 15. Qc1 {Move queen to safety in case black advances the d pawn.} Bf6 {I thought Bf6 was questionable. Maybe black planned to advance the d pawn and take out my e pawn, which would allow the bishop to claim my rook at a1. I would have move the knight to f6 instead since that would accomplish two goals: attack the undefended e4 pawn and allow the king to castle.} 16. c5 Ne7 17. cxd6 {I really want my knight on the c5 square, so I just have to move my pawn out of way.} Rxd6 18. Nc5 Qc8 {Queen moves to temporary safety.} 19. Bxa6 {Now I can get black's a pawn for free and force black to give up another move to protect the queen.} Qb8 20. Nxe6 Rxe6 21. Bc4 Rd6 22. Qc3 Ng6 {Black must think I am after the e5 pawn. I considered that as a possible target of opportunity for this queen move, but I had another target of opportunity in mind. I like dual purpose moves.} 23. Qb3 O-O 24. Qc2 Qb7 25. Nd2 Rfd8 26. Nb3 {Now with two rooks lined up, I best move the knight out of the way. And get the knight to where I can put it on the front lines.} Qe7 27. Nc5 Nf4 28. Ba6 {I moved the bishop here, so I could move the knight to b7 and fork the two rooks.} Rd6d2 {But black had other plans for those rooks.} 29. Qb3 Ne2+ 30. Bxe2 {Looks like my bishop won't be supporting my knight after all.} Rxe2 31. Qf3 Red2 32. a4 {Time to march the pawns.} Rb8 33. Rfb1 Qe8 34. a5 Rd4 {Looks like black really wants to stop the b pawn.} 35. Qa3 {Better bring in reinforcements.} Be7 36. a6 {I considered moving the f pawn up to support the e pawn. If Bxc5 followed by bxc5, then the rook could take the e pawn for free. I decided that another pawn push would do more to make black worry. Chess is a psychological game after all.} Bxc5 37. bxc5 Rxb1+ {I really expected black to take that free pawn. I guess taking out a rook was more tempting.} 38. Rxb1 Rd8 39. f3 {Now I support the e pawn.} Kh7 40. h3 {Give my king an escape square just in case.} Ra8 41. Qa4 Ra7 42. Rb6 {Move rook so it and my queen can threaten the c pawn and protect the a pawn. I like dual purpose moves.} Rc7 43. a7 {Give black something to worry about.} Qa8 44. Ra6 {Protect the a pawn.} f6 45. Qa5 Rb7 46. Kh2 {Move king to safety.} Rb5 {Black threatens my queen.} 47. Qa3 {I considered Qc7 and also Qa3. Both would protect the a pawn. One of them would also protect the c pawn. Another dual purpose move.} h5 48. Rb6 {I like this little symmetry with the rooks and pawns. But the positional symmetry hides a tactical asymmetry. On one hand, if Rxb6, then cxb6 and now I have a pawn supporting the a pawn. I can them move my queen to a6 to both threaten b7 and Qxc6. Putting both pawns on the 7th row would guarantee one of them would become queen. On the other hand, if I take black's rook with Rxb5, I could then pick off black's pawn on b5. It would mean giving up the pawn on a7, but I would still have the c pawn to guide to the 8th rank. Nice how the positional symmetry hides a tactical asymmetry.} g6 {This is interesting! Black doesn't take the bait to exchange rooks, but instead makes his king vulnerable.} 49. Qa6 {I follow with Qa6! This allows me both threaten the pawn on c6 and threaten to trap the queen with Rb8 and threaten check with Qb7! Three options for a single move!} Rxc5 {Black took the pawn which allows me to choose the tactic that ...} 50. Rb8 {... traps the black queen! The queen has 3 moves and they all lead to capture! Black resigned at this point.}
