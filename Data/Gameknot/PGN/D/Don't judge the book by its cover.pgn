1. f4 {The Bird Opening Move....... this kind of opening are seldomly used by top rated players. But who knows what contains in this "Bird".} d5 {The natural answer which is usually created to fight for the center squares.} 2. Nf3 {Preventing the e5 thrust from the opponent.} Bg4 {This move helps black to neutralize the centre squares (.....Bxf3, then ......e5)} 3. e3 {Just in case ......Bxf3, if not, doubled pawns will be occur and that sucks} Nd7 {Normal move order...... see it?, to support the e5 thrust again.} 4. b3 {Normal continuation for Bird opening move, this black squared bishop is too strong here.} e6 {....e6?!, a dubious move. After all the supporting moves, black came up with this one. Hmmm....... remember the topic.} 5. Bb2 {Yes!!! a good spot.} Ngf6 6. d3 {Preventing .....Ne4, and a spot for white's knight .... 7. Nbd2.} Bd6 {Black readies his castling thus putting the bishop into good square.} 7. h3 {Provoking black to capture the f3 knight. .....Bh5 is bad} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 O-O {The king looks safe right....... wait in a few moves.} 9. Nd2 c6 10. g4 {White is transposing to the "Polar Bear System" (invented and deeply analyzed by GM Henrik Danielsen from Poland)} h6 {Preventing the g5!! move} 11. h4 {Supporting the g5!!} b5 {What the????} 12. g5 {Black should try other moves like .....Nh7} hxg5 13. hxg5 Ne8 14. Qh5 {The KILLER move appears....... now, what else can black do here} f6 {To make some breathing space for his King..... nope TOO LATE!!!!} 15. g6 {After this move, black resigned because it's all over now}
