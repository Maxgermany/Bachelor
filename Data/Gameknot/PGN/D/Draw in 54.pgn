1. e4 {This is a really long game. 54 moves in total. We both made mistakes. Overall, we played pretty much the same. I hope you take the time to read all of this. My longest annotated game so far! :) } e5 {e4 defense} 2. Nf3 {a basic knight opening } Nc6 {a good defense } 3. Bb5 {I love this move. The bishop sacrifice ends up being very useful! You will soon see. } Bc5 {He wants the easy check. } 4. Bxc6 {But no! } dxc6 {Now, having that knight gone, I can attack the pawn. } 5. Nxe5 {+1 point :)} Qf6 {He is looking for a easy mate. I am a better chess player then that! } 6. Qf3 {If you move, it's my mate! } Be6 {Wanting to castle? At a time like this? } 7. Qxf6 {Down with the queen! } gxf6 {Get out of the way knight! } 8. Nd3 {Good! I am in a good position! } O-O-O {He has strange urges to castle. Why? How do I know? I take advantage of it anyway. } 9. Nxc5 {KABOOM! } b6 {He wants me....OUT! } 10. Nxe6 {But, I'm not leaving without a fight. } fxe6 {Things look great for me. But, this is where I start making mistakes. } 11. f4 {A pawn pair } Nh6 {He is ready for a struggle....} 12. e5 {So am I! } fxe5 {Got him! } 13. fxe5 {:)} Rhg8 {He wants that pawn. } 14. O-O {I decide to risk it and castle. } Ng4 {This is where it gets really bad. } 15. h3 {A bad move I soon find out. } Nxe5 {Down goes the pawn} 16. Re1 {Probably my biggest mistake. I will aways regret this. } Nf3+ {AHHHHHHH!!!!!!! } 17. Kf2 Nxe1 {This is really a huge loss. } 18. Kxe1 {But, I am still one ahead. } Rxg2 {But, not for long.....} 19. d4 {What was I thinking? Why did I do that? } Rh2 {He wants my pawn. What can I do?} 20. Bg5 {This is a good try. } Rg8 {I would have gone for the pawn myself.....} 21. Be3 {I find the possible mate just in time. } Rxh3 {But, I still lose a pawn. } 22. Kd2 {King will protect. } Rg2+ {But, not for long. } 23. Kd3 {He has to hide. } b5 {He decides to build things up with his pawns } 24. Nd2 {I get my defense ready. } a5 {He goes on......} 25. a3 {I follow. } h5 {Again and again...} 26. b4 {A pawn takedown. } Rgg3 {He is going to get me here......} 27. Nf1 {Not yet!!! } Rgf3 {Now what? } 28. bxa5 {I decide to take a risk } Kb7 {It's ok } 29. a4 {Get the pawn down! } Rf5 {He is ready. } 30. axb5 {I go on and attack. } Rxb5 {It was right about now when I sent a draw offer. He declined. } 31. a6+ {Get the king away.......} Ka7 {But, he stays} 32. Nd2 {I don't want my king to leave the fort! } e5 {He trys to destroy the fort......} 33. dxe5+ {and I bite. } c5 {????? A bad move. The pawn was wide open!!!!!} 34. e6 {I take advantage and run. } Rb8 {He is ready! } 35. Rb1 {This was a bad move. He could have won if not for this.....} Re8 {He gets scared. A bad move. Taking down the rook would have been a great move. } 36. Rb7+ {A bad move. Now, the pawn is gone } Kxa6 {Gotta run! } 37. Rxc7 {Now I'm going pawn hunting! } Rxe6 {So is he. } 38. Nc4 {I don't want a lost bishop do I? } Rg3 {I don't see the point of this } 39. Rxc5 {Pawn is gone! } h4 {Now, I do not want to trade rooks. It could cost me.....} 40. Rh5 {I go for the pawn } h3 {He has a good defense } 41. Ra5+ {I try to buy time } Kb7 {I was still thinking about what to do after a day or two, when I came up with this. } 42. Rh5 {A basic move, yes. } Re7 {But, he wants check! He wants me out of my fort! } 43. Rd5 {Nope, you can't do that my friend! } h2 {The end is near.......what will I do????} 44. Rh5 {The only thing I can do.....} Rd7+ {I have to sacrifice my great position. } 45. Ke2 {But, still keep the bishop safe. } Rg2+ {Gotta move. } 46. Kf3 {But, I will never leave the bishop. } Rxc2 {He thinks he is so smart! } 47. Ne5 {But, I have a few things up my sleeve. } Rd5 {A good move? Well......} 48. Ke4 {Not if I have anything to say about it! } Ra5 {You want me in check........again?????} 49. Kf5 {I don't think so! } Re2 {He wants my players badly! } 50. Bf4 {But nope, it wont do } Ra1 {He wants to give his queen a safe arrival. } 51. Rxh2 {I take a huge risk. Now that his pawn is gone I jump for this. I sent him a draw offer about now. He declined! It was not a smart decision. I had a better chance of winning then he ever did! } Rxh2 {He bites. } 52. Bxh2 {I bite back. It's only stale mate ahead.....} Ra2 {He finally realizes the situation and asks me to send a draw offer. } 53. Bf4 {I do. } Ra5 {He accepts. This game really boosted my rating. The ending was quite interesting. I am glad you read all of this. It was a good game. } 54. Bd2 {}
