1. d4 {White starts with the Queen's Pawn Opening.} Nf6 {Black responds with the Queen's Pawn Game.} 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 h6 {Here, I deviated from established opening moves in order to protect against White's dark bishop pinning my kingside knight as well as having his knight move to g5.} 4. Nc3 Bb4 {White moves out his queenside knight and I pin it with my dark bishop.} 5. Bd2 {White unpins his knight.} O-O {I am often guilty of not castling early enough in the game.  Not so here.  ;-)} 6. e3 Nc6 7. a3 {White forces Black's dark bishop to capture the c3 knight or retreat.} Bxc3 {Capture it is!} 8. Bxc3 d6 {Trying to make some room for Black's light bishop.} 9. Bd3 {White appears ready to castle short.} Bd7 {Trying to clear the back rank.} 10. Rc1 b6 11. Bb1 {White retreats his bishop to clear the d column or to align his queen in front of it...} Ne7 {Moving the queenside knight kingside to bolster the defense.} 12. Qc2 {Queen and bishop are aligned!  All White has to do is remove the knight at f6 and he has an easy win.} g6 {Moving the g pawn forward reduces Black's dependency on the f6 knight...} 13. h4 {...until White's kingside pawns start advancing!} d5 {Challenging White's c pawn and, if declined, creating the opportunity to move the f6 knight to e4 (to block the b1-h7 diagonal.)} 14. c5 {Declined.} a5 { } 15. h5 {Uh-oh!  Black doesn't dare capture the h5 pawn with 15. ... gxh5 as 16. Rxh5 then threatens the h6 pawn!  The rook on h5 would then be inviolable as 17. ... Nxh5 would result in 18. Qh7#.} Kg7 {Adding the king's protection to the g and h pawns and making room for either the kingside rook or the knights to move behind the king as needed.} 16. hxg6 {Cutting into Black's defenses! } fxg6 {Black's g pawn is now protected by only the king and one knight.  Black's h pawn has only the king guarding it.  This isn't looking so good, especially considering that White can add a knight and a couple more kingside pawns to the attack!} 17. Ne5 {Adding pressure to Black's g pawn.} Be8 {Adding additional protection to Black's g pawn.} 18. f3 {Although Black is holding it together, that can only last until White's remaining kingside pawns advance.} c6 {Giving Black's queen a little breathing room and preventing the advance of White's c pawn which would make life in the Black kingdom exceedingly awkward!} 19. Ke2 {White decides not to castle, but instead makes room for the queenside rook to assist the attack from the kingside or for his dark-squared bishop to pass through e1 on its way to join the attack.} b5 {Making a little more room and removing the Black queen's responsibility to guard the b pawn.  Also hoping to drive back White's dark bishop (more for something to do than because it would really change anything) and maybe even open a column for a much needed counterattack!} 20. b4 {No driving back the bishop now.  At this point I finally saw a possibility for a Black counter attack, requiring a sacrifice and leveraging the White king's slightly forward position.  I spent a lot of time contemplating the various continuations, most of which looked favourable but, in the end, I didn't have any better ideas so I decided to go for it.} axb4 {First, try to open the a column...} 21. axb4 {... a column opened.} Ra3 {Advance the rook and hope White does the predictable...} 22. Bb2 {Yes, he does.} Rxe3+ {Surprise!  An unexpected attack, but so what?} 23. Kxe3 {White takes the gift rook, probably wondering where the threat lies...} Nf5+ {Check!  But even this doesn't look all that dangerous...} 24. Kd2 {... just move the king back a bit...} Ne4+ {Check!!  Sacrifice #2!!!  Surely Black will run out of pieces before this accomplishes anything?} 25. fxe4 {White gobbles up the knight and now has a seven point material advantage.  He has also blocked the b1-h7 diagonal.} Ng3 {Attacking the h1 rook, threatening check with Nxe4+ and clearing the f column.  What will White do about the threat of Rf2+ which could win his queen?  (Ng4 would be met with h5, forcing the knight to retreat or be captured; Nd3 would be followed by Nxe4+ which prevents the king from escaping to c3 but slows Black's attack nonetheless; Nf3 would block the f column and prevent Black's queen from checking on g5, but would be met with dxe4, again forcing the knight to move or be captured.)} 26. Qb3 {White opts to move his queen instead, attacking the unprotected knight and transferring protection of the e4 pawn to the light bishop, meaning that checking the King with the knight again will result in an exchange.} Qg5+ {Check!  Lots of continuations here: if White moves his king to his back rank, the Black knight will capture the unprotected rook on h1; if the White king goes to c2, then Black's knight takes the unprotected e4 pawn, threatening mate soon thereafter with the rook and queen; should White choose c3 for the king, Black can follow up with checks from his queen and knight which would cost White his queen, and if the White king moves to d3, then dxe4+ will force him to move again, to either c2 or c3.  There remains one other option...} 27. Qe3 {Up by seven?  Let's try to force a queen exchange!  Seems reasonable except for what follows...} Rf2+ {There is no way to capture the rook and no opportunity to block.  White must move his king to the only square that continues to lend protection to his queen.} 28. Kd3 {If Black hesitates, there will certainly be an exchange of queens!} dxe4+ {At this point, White resigned, having very limited options: moving the king out of check loses the queen; capturing the checking pawn with the queen results in checkmate (29. ...  Qd2#).}
