1. e4 {Evening all! i was hesitating to call this game "3rd time is a charm" as this is the third game vs this opponent. I give alot of respect to my opponent. He beat me fair and square in game 1, and in game 2 i got cheeky and tried a bishop sac and he made me pay and i couldnt take advantage of it in the end, making him up 2 nil.  } Nc6 {i guess my opponent enjoys playing against me as i do enjoy playing against him. after this game he sent another challenge and we are currently playing a 4th. who knows how long this series could potentially go.} 2. d4 {and let the games begin.  the most aggressive reply against the nimzowitsch. As for me, this game i cant screw around.  im going with what i'm comfortable with.} d5 {natural replies ensue } 3. e5 {tick} Bf5 {tock} 4. Bb5 {like} e6 {clock} 5. Nf3 {work!} f6 {and here i decided im taking the fight to him. im comfortable enough in my opening to go at it aggressively. and i like to invite the double pawn in the c file to take off his LSB in simple fashion.  usually id maybe aim to either kick the bishop with a5 to force him off right away. or reinforce e7 with my gknight.  but this game is a 3rd rematch dont want to get fancy. } 6. Nh4 {anticipated reply and i was expecting the queen to possibly come down next which often gets triggered when playing the f pawn.} fxe5 {and so onwards with the plan. clearing of the middle to help DSB movement. open a file for when i will king side castle.} 7. Nxf5 {hmm takes the bishop right away. i guess he knew better than to come down with his queen right away.} exf5 8. dxe5 Bc5 {i didnt think his pawn was bothersome yet, nor did i feel like my pawns had become unconnected in anyway.  this puts pressure on his f pawn with future play possibly with my queen} 9. Nc3 {more development + pressure on d pawn} Nge7 {i guess it invites development for me too and ne7 is very friendly in the nimzowitsch opening} 10. Bg5 {i dont face this pin very often but i am aware of it} O-O {playing queen d7 is also playable i believe. this castle invites alot of exchanges though. as whites pieces are all aiming different targets while all mine have good proximity/synergy, and if white doesnt start attacking very soon itll give me the chance to be the aggressor.} 11. Nxd5 {charge! my opponent says.} Nxe5 {i replied in kind by also removing his bothersome middle pawn} 12. Nxe7+ {the market is neutral though today. black and white pieces are getting traded at even value. although blacks property will kind look like a tornado went through after the markets close!} Bxe7 {pif} 13. Qxd8 {zonk} Bxd8 {bam} 14. Bf4 {ohohoho! i really expected bxd8  i guess my opponent wanted to retain the bishop pair after the exchanges. im happy i get to keep my strong bishop.  i thought the next reply was quite obvious} Bf6 {simple. protects the knight and puts pressure on b2} 15. O-O-O {and my opponent chooses to castle long. i dont know if there was any advantages or not considering his bishops and his pawn lines.  except maybe the fact castling long places a rook in an open file immediately i guess.} c6 {as for me i liked his queen side castle, kind simplifies my plan into doing a queen side pawn push} 16. Ba4 {he invites b5. i thought this to be curious. but i felt like playing b5 was still right at this stage of the game with the pieces we have left} b5 17. Bb3+ Nc4 {and so im willing to swap out his LSB at the cost of a double pawn} 18. Bxc4+ {and he accepts} bxc4 19. Rd6 {after this move i played a tad too fast,  maybe playing c5 was better or Rac8.} Rab8 {right after i told myself ,this wasnt a good reply. its an even trade, he will stunt my attack on b2 and now i got double pawns x2 eeps. overlooked the bishop blind attack in my quickplay} 20. Rxf6 gxf6 {forced or else lose the rook without taking the bishop} 21. Bxb8 Rxb8 22. Rd1 Re8 {alight friend ill take control of the other file then! lets see where this is headed. im still not giving up, given the situation lol. i got many pawns already up the board going for me is all i can say lol} 23. Rd2 {wow very curious reply i thought he would start attacking my pawns. i saw this as an opportunity to get tempo on my side} Re1+ {force the rook retreat} 24. Rd1 Re2 {and plant myself on the very file he was on, how mean!} 25. Rf1 {what i was hoping for!  now that rook is going to sleep for a while!} c3 {my thought here is i want him to double pawn to make it harder to pass } 26. bxc3 {he delightfully accepted} f4 {im testing the waters. but this pawn i dont need to sacrifice.} 27. Kb2 {yup i was thinking the same thing mate. time to get our kings into the action!} Kf7 28. Kb3 Ke6 29. c4 Kd6 30. c3 {after this position. i had to formulate a plan. i couldnt just go around with my king it wouldnt be enough.  i also told myself the best way to gain as much time queen side is to not play the a pawn ever.} c5 {and so i try to lock the position up a bit and force his king to the A file if he wants to come down} 31. g3 f3 {now my pawn is pretty high. i like this situation. all i have to do is get my king up there} 32. h3 h5 {hindsight 20/20 advancing the king side pawns was good before too much of the board gets cut off. the end game race was won by 1 square.} 33. a3 {curiously he didnt go A4. but i guess he didnt want to block his king in...  so id take this was a loss of tempo for white. if his plan was to get the king to a4 then b5 he shouldve left the pawn on a2 and gone ahead with his king move right away.} Ke5 {and so i drudge on towards that rook and back c pawn} 34. Ka4 {expected} Ke4 35. Kb5 {expected} Kd3 36. Kxc5 {and he takes. which is ok} Rc2 {decide to attack the pawns with my rook} 37. Kb4 {taking with my rook now is dangerous. leads to a losing race } Rb2+ {and so i decide to move my rook out of possible exchange squares} 38. Kc5 Kxc3 {i take back the pawn, i had analysed so many end games. and our 2 strongest pawns were both his C pawns and my F pawns, his having and edge at the moment being unblocked} 39. Rc1+ Kd3 {no exchanges yet!} 40. Kd5 {move out of his pawns way. im happy my rook was on the B file. his centralised king is what lead to my win i believe} Rxf2 41. c5 {and so we are off to the races} Rc2 42. Rxc2 Kxc2 43. c6 {and my opponent offers a Draw at this stage! i told myself what! im too curious what his reply will be after his Check promotion to end it before that.  i told him "we are playing a few turns with our new queens before i concede this one"  specially after being down 0-2 against him.  } f2 {and so it continues!} 44. c7 f1=Q 45. c8=Q+ Kd1 {and i reply this. he cannot recheck with his queen. i thought he would reply with Qe6 most probably considering all avenues.  and this is the position i got to in analysis and thought that accepting a draw on 43 wasnt wise.  im pretty sure my Edged king vs his centralised king is an advantage in the battle of the queens. also considering my king is on white squares and my strong pawn is on a dark square protected by my queen currently.} 46. Qe6 {and he did! woo im not sure how effective being able to predict some of your opponents move at this stage of the game can be considering the grand spectrum of movements a queen can do. but im pretty sure it helps you guide your future moves.} Qf3+ {offer a check attacking both his pawns at once} 47. Qe4 {anticipated. trading out now is a losing race not yet trix!} Qxg3 {and strengthen my F pawn.   ball is in your court friend!  i thought he would go to d4+ and then Qxa7 cause opening the way to his A pawn looks strong. but his A pawn is too slow compared to my F pawn.   } 48. Qd4+ {prediction again!} Kc2 {Aggressive forward movement with my king. i aint afraid of no queen!  i also told myself its wiser to stay on the white squares with my king at the moment} 49. Qxa7 {oh and third prediction.  i think this was the game costing mistake. we debated, my opponent and I, and he also believes he shouldve taken the f pawn after immediately playing.} Qe5+ 50. Kc4 {what!!!! unexpected really. gets closer to my king.   man i really thought his square of choice was going to be c6.  have to reanalyze the whole race from here now. and man its losing by 1 square. whats the damned solution. where do i move my queen hmm.  looking for exchanges can change the tempo into my opponents favor.  so i take a step back} f5 {oh its so simple.   after analyzing his kings position. i dont want his king to move anymore. my queen  is preventing alot of that.  and his king cuts off alot of angles to my king with his queen.  and after this pawn move. the race is back on my side by 1 square...} 51. Qa4+ {anticipated sorta.    i didnt look at Qf2+ to see if it wouldve been better for white to try to nudge my king towards the top right corner.} Kd2 {for me my plan was to now offer as much cover to my F pawn and get my king as close as possible to the H file for the final race} 52. Qd7+ {my opponent is looking for the exchange!} Ke3 {but now my king is passed } 53. Qd3+ {trying to exchange} Kf2 {felt going higher was safer. could allow movement for my pawn} 54. Qd4+ {forces the exchange but i had analysed up to where we both get our queens and thought i had the winning position.} Qxd4+ 55. Kxd4 f4 56. a4 f3 57. a5 Kg3 {important not to go to g2 or else he gets a check with his pawn promotion.} 58. a6 f2 59. a7 f1=Q 60. a8=Q {i took a while to try to see if i can force a queen exchange. i couldnt see one. i could only see perpetual checks into a position where i might make a mistake.} Qxh3 {so i thought this was instantly winning. told myself there is no way he can both eat pawn and queen with just the queen. and my kings proximity to my pawn makes it unstoppable.} 61. Qa3+ Kh2 {my thought here is all i have to do is get my queen in front of my king} 62. Qxh3+ {hmm curious. my opponent offers the exchange} Kxh3 63. Ke3 Kg2 64. Kf4 h4 {and my opponent resigns.   he told me he was miscalculated by 1 square.    i have to note here. this is the third clear game i remember a situation like this. where a player makes the end game mistake of forgetting the 1 square buffer around kings when analyzing ahead.  as for me i think my 3 correct "predictions" helped me figure out when it was the right time to exchange out material to be on the 1 square lead and not behind in the end game race. i hope you all enjoyed the game.   comments appreciated.  boy was i happy to decline the draw. heres to hoping i tie our score 2-2 and win our 4th session hehe}
