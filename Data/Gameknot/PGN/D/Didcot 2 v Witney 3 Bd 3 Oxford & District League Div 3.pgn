1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Nf3 {Not the most aggressive response to the King's Indian I've met ...} d6 5. Bg5 {Another early Bg5 (cf my recent game against Oliver Cairns).  I spent some time working out how best to deal with this, as it's a bit of a nuisance, pinning my N against my Q if the e-pawn makes its normal advance.  In the past I've moved the Q to e8 to avoid the pin but in this game I decided that the N wanted to use e8.  For a while I got a rather cramped looking position but it proved a solid launch pad for a strong counter-attack.} O-O 6. e4 Ne8 7. Qd2 f6 {Pushing the annoying bishop back.  White can either keep it on the h4-d8 diagonal or, more temptingly, use it to attack the fianchettoed B.} 8. Bh6 Nd7 9. Bd3 {White's position looks much more active than Black's but Black's has great potential.  My plan is to launch a kingside storm typical of the King's Indian.} e5 10. Bxg7 {I didn't mind this.  The fianchettoed bishop is very inactive early in the game, only realising its potential later, if it survives.  By swapping off his much more active and annoying B, White did me a favour.} Nxg7 {This N stays here happily for most of the rest of the game before eventually helping to deliver the coup de grace.} 11. d5 {White releases the tension in the centre but gains territory.} Nc5 {Another disadvantage of White's 11. d5 was that it gave me this square for the N that was blocking in my B.} 12. Bc2 {This retreat avoids the swap and covers all of the N's potential advances.} a5 {Played to prevent a Bayonet Attack (b4) and slow down White's potential queenside counter-attack.} 13. O-O f5 {Preparations were now complete for this thematic advance.} 14. Qh6 {This attack looked potentially frightening and deadly but, after a relatively long think for me, I found the perfect response, preventing a mating attack on h7.} Qe7 {Prepares to defend h7 by moving the Ng7 away.} 15. Qd2 {So White abandoned the kingside attack.} f4 {and I closed the door, to allow my g-pawn to join the attack.} 16. a3 {White starts to prepare his queenside counter-attack - but it's too slow, now that he's wasted 2 moves with his Q.} g5 17. h3 {Ineffective and further delays his counter-attack.} g4 {The g-pawn advances anyway.} 18. hxg4 Bxg4 {The B's first move attacks White's main defender and threatens to give him doubled pawns and a big hole in front of his K.} 19. Nh2 Qg5 {Hoping to exploit a pin on the file.  I was torn between this and 19.... Qh4.  The disadvantage of 19...Qg4 was that it pinned my own f-pawn against my Q.} 20. f3 {I couldn't now see a great use for 20 ... Bh3 as White's Q defended g2, so I retreated the B to await a better opportunity and also help defend the queenside.} Bd7 21. b4 axb4 22. axb4 Rxa1 {Played to prevent White from doing the same, which would have taken my KR away from the kingside, where I planned to set up a battery on g2.} 23. Rxa1 Na6 {A natural square for this N in the King's Indian.  This was the only move to save the N but it also provokes White ...} 24. Na4 {Defends the b-pawn and prepares the c-pawn's advance.  White seems to have seized the initiative here.} Rf6 {But Black can ignore him because Black's threats are mating ones.} 25. b5 Nc5 {Back to my favourite square.} 26. Nxc5 dxc5 27. Bd3 {White prepares to defend g2 with Bf1.} Rg6 28. Bf1 Nh5 {Now all Black's pieces are involved in the attack.  White's forces are spread across the board.} 29. Ra7 {A futile gesture ...} Ng3 30. Ra2 {White thinks better of the the adventure and further defends g2.} Qh4 {So I switch my attack to the h-file.  The N sitting on g3 prevents White from defending it.} 31. Ng4 {Loses immediately but White only had about 4 minutes left on his clock.  I had 58.} Qh1+ 32. Kf2 Qxf1# {Very satisfying :-) }
