[Opening "Danish gambit (C21), Collijn defence"]

1. e4 {I am no longer an e4 player due to the monster of theory that is the sicilian defence. I have sadly gone the way of opening with the more quiet d4 and have adopted the colle system nowadays. However this game was agreed as being a Danish Gambit accepted so I need not worry about 1 ...c5} e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 {Offering another pawn for time and space to develop quickly and prepare an attack.} dxc3 {(0.08)} 4. Bc4 {(-1.21) Gambiting the second pawn.} cxb2 {(-1.29)} 5. Bxb2 {(-1.13) This is the starting position of the game. I used to play the Danish Gambit as white on the odd occasion and still do in blitz chess. This opening is a relic from the olden days of romantic chess. It doesn't have a refutation i'm aware of but if black exchanges early on and defends well he will have the superior endgame. } Bb4+ {(-1.17)} 6. Nd2 {(-1.37) This is slighlty better than 6. Nc3 because it leaves the b2 bishop active surveying the a1-h8 diagonal where the white king will be castled.} Nf6 {(-1.45)} 7. Qb3 {(-3.43) This creates a battery aiming at f7 and also threatening black's dark squared bishop. I was also trying to tempt ...Nxe4.  The computer says this is a blunder suggesting 7. Ngf3 O-O 8. O-O d6 9. a3 Bc5 10. e5 dxe5 11. Nxe5. The computer evaluates black as having a moderate advantage here. } Bxd2+ {(-3.59) Black exchanges removing one of his only developed pieces instead of retreating or defending the bishop, this does have the positive of forcing my king to recapture losing castling rights and leaving it in a central position wide open to attack.} 8. Kxd2 {(-3.51) I'm feeling uneasy with my king positioned here especially considering the strength of my opponent, but there is no alternative.} O-O {(-1.97) I can see the logic in this , castling early to protect the king and trying to avoid grabbing more pawns at the expense of development howvever better is 8... Nxe4+ 9. Kc2 O-O 10. Nf3 Nc6 11. Bd5 Nf6 12. Bc3 d6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 leaving black with a large queenside majority and white with an exposed king and no realistic attacking threats as compensation.} 9. e5 {(-3.83) My immediate thought here was to remove the Kings Knight the only piece defending the king-side. The computer analysis says this is a  MISTAKE better is  9. Qf3 d5 10. Bxf6 dxe4+ 11. Bxd8 Rxd8+ 12. Kc3 exf3 13. Nxf3 Nc6 14. Ng5 Ne5, however this leaves black with a decisive advantage. To be fair though with good defence by black, white should not be able to win from here. } Ne4+ {(-3.51) The only alternative is 9...Ng4 but 9...Ne4+ immediately challenegs the king while also centralising the knight and attacking f2. } 10. Ke3 {(-3.67) Computer; Defending f2, chosen as opposed to Ke1 because I didn;t want to block communications between my rooks witha nother piece. INACCURACY 10. Ke1 Qh4 11. Qc2 Nxf2 12. Nf3 Nd3+ 13. Kf1 Nb4 14. Rd1 is better apparently.} Nc5 {(-4.76)} 11. Qc2 {(-4.36) Still aiming at the kingside} Qg5+ {(-2.34) Black is wasting time here with a pointless check and allowing me to parry by marching one of my kingside pawns up the board. Comp: MISTAKE 11... d5 12. Rd1 c6 13. Bb3 Qa5 14. Bc3 Qb5 15. Kd2 Bg4 16. Nf3 leaves black with a strong grip in the centre and only one piece behind in development and obviously two pawns up.} 12. f4 {(-2.42) } Qd8 {(-1.13) Retreating to its starting point has essentially given me an extra move attacking the kingside, generally not a good idea in the Danish Gambit. Black has no pieces protecting the kingside and qyeenside pieces are yet to leave the back rank. I feel this position is promising for white. Comp: 12... Qh6 13. Ne2 d6 14. Kf2 Bg4 15. exd6 cxd6 16. Kg1 Nc6 and black has fully devloped his pieces yet there is still some energy in the position for white. } 13. h4 {(-2.82) Having played f4 I feel a pawn storm brewing which forces black to consider the defence of the kingside. The computer prefers 13. Rd1 Nc6 14. Nf3 h6 15. Kf2 b6 16. g3 Ba6 } d6 {(-3.15) Opening the diagonal for the lightsquared bishop and contesting the centre.} 14. h5 {(-3.51) I continued my plan of aussaulting the king ASAP before black could mobilise pieces to aid in its defence. Hoevever the computer sees this as a mistake suggesting  14. Nf3 Nc6 15. Ng5 g6 16. Kf2 b5 17. Bxf7+ Rxf7 18. Nxf7 } d5 {(-1.77) Again neglecting development. The analysis suggests  14... Nc6 15. Rd1 Qe7 16. Kf2 dxe5 17. Nf3 exf4 18. Rhe1 Be6 with a dynamic position.} 15. Bd3 {(-3.31) This was not the best move, the light squared bishop is a key attacking piece for me and I shouldn't be allowing a trade.Computer suggests: 15. Ba3 Nbd7 16. Bxd5 Nb6 17. Qxc5 Nxd5+ 18. Kf2 Re8 19. Ne2 is better} Nxd3 {(-3.43) Accepting the trade, the only positive for me is it removes blacks only developed piece.} 16. Qxd3 {(-3.43)} c5 {(-3.27) Seizing control of d4 and leaving c3 for the devlopemnt of the knight. Also threatening ...d4! at some point removing the bishops scope along the diagonal.} 17. Kf2 {(-3.43) Retreating before black could get ...d5 in.} c4 {(-3.51) "Past pawns must be pushed" perhaps not so early though, I prefer 17...Nc6} 18. Qc2 {(-4.24) Retreating to c2 wanting to maintain my reach on h7. The computer says MISTAKE! 18. Qd2 Nc6 19. Ne2 Bg4 20. Nd4 Qb6 21. h6 Nxd4 22. Qxd4 } b5 {(-2.86) Overprotecting the c4 pawn perhaps envisaging an early d4 but black is still not developing the pieces on the Q-side. Comp: MISTAKE 18... Nc6 19. Ba3 Qb6+ 20. Kf1 Qd4 21. Qc1 Qd3+ 22. Kf2 Nd4 } 19. Nf3 {(-2.86) Developing my last piece and connecting rooks let the assualt commence.} h6 {(-2.86) Preventing the opening of the g file. At this position in the game I was trying to think of ways to open a file for my rook to attack the king. } 20. f5 {?! (-3.55) I continue my pawnstorm aiming to follow up with f6 trying to open up some lines to the enemy king. Computer: INNACCURACY now losing 20. Bd4 Nc6 21. Bc5 Re8 22. Rhd1 Bg4 23. Rab1 Bxh5 24. Rxb5 Bg6 } Nc6 {(-3.67) Developing. } 21. f6 {(-4.08) I like this move because if 21...g6! 22.hxg6 fxg6 23. Qxg8+ Kh8 24.Rxh6# However the computer in its wisdom says: INNACCURACY 21. Rhd1 b4 22. Bd4 Qa5 23. g4 c3 24. Kg3 Ba6 25. Be3. My move has the psychological advantage of forcing black to consider his defence again and to avoid this trap. } d4 {(-1.53) BLUNDER 21... gxf6 22. Qd2 Qb6+ 23. Qe3 Qxe3+ 24. Kxe3 b4 25. exf6 c3 26. Bc1 } 22. Ng5 {?! (-6.9) I thought this move was Morphyesque at the time, there is no going back from this position I have to continue the attack so I decide to sac the night opening the h-file. Whats not to like? The computer does not agree with my move though assessing it as a BLUNDER 22. Qe4 Bd7 23. fxg7 Re8 24. Bxd4 Nxd4 25. Qxd4 Qb6 26. Rad1. I feel if I had not played such a move which forced black to open a file to his king I wouldn't be able to launch a succesful attack.} hxg5 {(-6.9) Pretty much forced due to the threat of mate on h7.} 23. h6 {(-7.15) My soldiers march on towards the king. exchanging here would be disastrous as recapturing with the rook would quickly lead to mate. } g6 {(-6.98) Blocking the inlfuence of my queen but leaving the path for my pawn to march onward.} 24. Rae1 {(-9.09)The immediate h7 would be foolish as I have left the e pawn hanging. The computer confirms my idea of defending the e pawn first is correct although I chose the wrong piece. 24. Qe4 Qb6 25. g4 d3+ 26. Kf1 Kh8 27. Rh3 Re8 } Nb4 {(-8.24) MISTAKE 24... Nxe5 25. h7+ Kh8 26. Kf1 Qxf6+ 27. Kg1 c3 28. Ba3 Re8 } 25. Bc1 {?? (-20.4) Before this move I assesed the position and realised that blacks phalanx of three connected past pawns would soon overcome my resistance if I couldn't somehow strike out at the king. I decided to to go for an audacious offer of a queen sacrifice. my idea was after 25...Nxc2 26. Bxg5 Nxe1 27. h7+ Kh8 28.Bh6 Kxh7 29. Bg7 disc+ Kg8 30. Rh8#. However once again the computer disagrees:  29. BLUNDER 25. Qe4 Nd3+ 26. Kg3 Nxe1 27. Rxe1 Bf5 28. Qxd4 Qa5 29. Kf2 Qxa2 30. Rh1 This line does not aim to mate the black king though, mine contains a trap.} Nd3+ {? (-9.73) Not accepting my unsound sac which the computer doesn't like: BLUNDER 25... Nxc2 26. h7+ Kh8 27. Re2 d3 28. Rxc2 dxc2 29. Be3 Qd1 } 26. Kg3 {(-9.25)} Nxe1 {(-11.07) MISTAKE  26... Qd7 27. h7+ Kh8 28. Qd1 Nxe1 29. Rxe1 Kxh7 30. Rh1+ Kg8 31. e6 Qd6+ } 27. Bxg5 {(-11.07) The computer doesn't like this probabnly because of the loss of material howveer it is my last chance at mating the black king and sets one last trap.... [Comp: MISTAKE 27. Rxe1 d3 28. Qd2 Qd5 29. Qxg5 Bb7 30. h7+ Kh8 31. Kh4] } Nxc2 {?? (MATE in 7) MISTAKE 27... Qd5 28. Rxe1 Bf5 29. Qe2 c3 30. Rh1 Kh8 31. h7 Rae8. Black has fallen for my last effective chance of winning and has accepted the queen on the second offering. Black cannot avoid mate from here.} 28. h7+ {Forcing the king into the corner.} Kh8 {()} 29. Bh6 Rg8 {()} 30. hxg8=Q+ {()} Kxg8 {()} 31. Bg7 {1-0 Black resigned here rather annoyingly not allowing me that glorious moment of inflicting the final blow. Black could have held out a couple more moves with 31. Bg7 Qxf6 32. Bxf6 Bh3 33. Rxh3 Ne3 34. Rh8#.} Bb7 {Or more quickly!} 32. Rh8# {This game shows the pros of playing gambits, they may not be sound but they do create chances, if black does not play accurately enough to avoid the traps, white can win. It is one of the first open games I've played in a while and really encourages me to return to e4. I can't really compare myself to the great Morphy with my attacking play in this game but I do feel this is one of the best games I've played and this game is considerably more like one of Morphy's games than my typical games which are played according to my unambitious repertoire of the colle as white and the caro kann & QGD as black.
