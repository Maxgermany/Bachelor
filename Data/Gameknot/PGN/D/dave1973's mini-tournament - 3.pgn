1. d4 {This is a game played in, as you can see, dave1973's mini-tournament (in which I am also playing!), which, at the time of annotating, is still in progress.} d5 2. c4 {The Queen's Gambit - my favourite opening. In itself this is not a gambit, as White can force the pawn's recapture with 3.Qa4  and 4.Qxc4, but this continuation is useless and rarely played.} c6 {The Slav Defence, a solid line for Black.} 3. Nf3 {This is the usual move in many lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined.} dxc4 4. e3 {I don't like this move. Far better to play 4.e4 and build up a strong pawn centre. 4.e3 is too passive and blocks in the dark-squared bishop.} b5 5. a4 Qa5+ {The early emergence of a queen on the queenside is relatively common in the Queen's Gambit.} 6. Bd2 b4 {As is seen here, one of the factors that White must contend with after the Queen's Gambit Accepted is Black building up massive control over the queenside wing, often pushing pawns far into White's territory.} 7. Bxc4 e6 8. O-O Qh5 {Black wants to try attacking on the other side. I personally would have preferred keeping the queen where it was and developing more pieces - as you can see, Black has developed absolutely no minor pieces.} 9. e4 {Black will pay for his lag in development - White is building up control of the centre.} Bd6 10. Qc2 {I would have gone for 9.e5, pushing Black's only developed piecs back. However, 9.Qc2 is a good move to shore up the queenside.} Nf6 11. e5 {Black walked straight into that fork.} Bc7 12. exf6 gxf6 13. Bxb4 {Just look at White's superb control. His bishops are powering down on Black's king, locking him into the centre.} Rg8 {Black controls the open file, pressurising White's king in return.} 14. Be2 Rg5 {I would have preferred 14...Qg4, trying to force a way into Black's kingside, and if 15.g3 then 15...Qh3, severely threatening and trapping White's queen, and then maybe a sacrifice ...Bxg3 or bringing the bishops into the attack in some other way. This could possibly have been a winning attack for Black!} 15. g3 Rg8 {Black has just wasted two moves.} 16. Ne5 Qh6 17. Qc5 {White is threatening a checkmate on Black's poor, exposed King - this should teach Black never to leave the King in the centre!} Bd8 18. Nxc6 {Black's lack of development makes White's breaking into Black's position easy.} Nxc6 19. Qxc6+ Bd7 20. Bb5 Bxc6 {A queen sacrifice finishes Black off...} 21. Bxc6# {...WHAM! Checkmate. Note that this would not have been so easy for White if Black had developed his minor pieces sooner and castled as soon as possible...which in turn means he should not have been wasting moves messing around with his queen so early and so much.}
