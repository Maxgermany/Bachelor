[Opening "Dunst (Sleipner, Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"]

1. Nc3 {In all the games on gameknot this is one I remember the most and enjoyed. It happened 3 years ago against clagersie. As normal there are many mistakes in my games but some good moves too. I start with the Dunst opening. A change from moving my normal e4.} d5 2. d4 {I made this move to block blacks advance and chasing my knight. It would have extended his pawns however. Also my bishop comes into play. I thought should I move e4 to prompt a pawn exchange but decided against it.} Nf6 3. Bg5 Nbd7 {Black protects his knight on f6 . A knight - bishop exchange would have meant  a double up of Black's pawns on the king side, I guess black did not want that.} 4. Nf3 {I continue my development.} e6 5. e4 {e3 a mirror move of Black's e6 was my other move. I choice e4 was to be a little more aggressive. Tempting a pawn exchange knowing if 5... dxe4. 6. Nxe4. Black knight unable to take my knight because my bishop pinning his knight against his Queen. My hope is that he will turn down the exchange  so I can advance my e pawn to e5 and pressure his knight.} h6 {Black turns down the exchange but sees the potential advance of e5  so black needs my bishop moved to unpin his knight.} 6. Bxf6 {I felt I had to make this move. Bh4 would have been foolish as black would have pushed g5 and Bishop would have to retreat further resulting the loss of my pawn on e4.} Nxf6 7. Qe2 {e4 needs protecting. other options were e5 and Bd3 but I decide to move my Queen in preparation to castle Queen side. Was Bd3 better. Should I have prepared to castle king side instead? comments please.} dxe4 8. Nxe4 b6 {Black looks to fianchethis bishop attacking knight on e4.} 9. O-O-O {I decide to castle. Maybe castling this side was a little weak as I've lost my black bishop to defend c1-h6 line and my knight is off c3. } Be7 {I thought black might have moved Bb7 here but instead looks to castle.} 10. h4 {Knowing that I have a weakness on c1-h6 line I decide to give g5 square extra protection.Also knowing that black will probably castle king side h4 starts a Queen side attack.} O-O 11. Ne5 {Looking to move to Nc6.attacking Queen and bishop.} Bb7 {Black stops that move  and now has a doumle attack on my knight at e4.} 12. Nc3 {Was f3 better? Maybe it was and it would have put a pawn in the centre if the piece exchange was made. I did not want to move my knight to g3 as it would have hindered my pawns so decided a defensive move to protect my kings pawns.} Bb4 13. Qd3 {Protecting my knight. I don't want 13... Bxc3 14. bxc3. That would weaken my pawn defense.} Bxc3 14. Qxc3 {Piece exchange but also moving me away from e4.} Ne4 15. Qe1 {Protecting my f pawn. } Re8 16. f3 {There's f3. Should have done that a few moves ago.} Nd6 {Black retreats.} 17. Qg3 {I did think of moving g4 to stop Nf5  but thought that would leave f3 very weak. Qg3 a poor move by me I feel but worse was to come.} Nf5 {A double attack on d4 with knight and queen and only my rook to defend. Also knight attacks my queen. } 18. Qg4 {a massive blunder by me, I look to defend d4 but Clagersie can now fork my queen and rook with Ne3. f2 or e1 would have been better.} Ne3 {Which he does.} 19. Qf4 {Save the queen.} Nxd1 20. Kxd1 f6 {I think I would have moved c5 here attacking d4.} 21. Ng6 {My knight finds a hole and hope's the pawn on the h file will advance to defend him.} e5 {Thing's are not looking good.} 22. Qd2 {blockading my king.} exd4 {I might have gone Qxd4 forcing a queen exchange.} 23. Bd3 {Waking my bishop up to give my rook more options.} Qd5 {attacking a2.} 24. b3 {I move b3 to protect a2 and threaten Bc4 pinning blacks Queen.} Qh5 {Black sees it.} 25. Bc4+ Kh7 {blacks other move was Bd5.} 26. Qd3 {I spot a possible double check but first should I have moved Bf7 or Nf4 attacking his Queen?} Re3 { This move surprised me and on first glance looks menacing. Blacks attention is clearly fixed on f3 with queen rook and bishop attacking it. Rook also looking my Queen in the face too but Black should have moved Be4 or Qxg6. Now for checkmate in 2! } 27. Nf8+ {Revealing a double check! Both Queen and Knight are safe. Only h8 is safe for the black king.} Kh8 {Black is dead and 3 up too!} 28. Qh7# {I enjoyed that ending, It could and should have been stopped but black did  not see the lethal double check rendering rooks attack on my Queen useless! That was pulled out of the fire!  Very satisfying, just proves sometimes when you make a horrible mistake sometimes not all is lost.}
