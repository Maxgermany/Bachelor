[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02)"]

1. e4 Nf6 {Alekhine's Defence again.} 2. d4 {!? I momentarily forget myself and thrust the d pawn forward, rather than the usual e-pawn.  As it wasn't deliberate, I can't really take credit for this gambit, but it works rather well.} Nxe4 3. Bd3 d5 4. c4 {immediately undermining the N's support, using the same method I usually employ in the Petroff} e6 {an option not available to Black in the Petroff.  This seems a sensible response, though it does block Black's WSB in.} 5. Ne2 {Preparing Nc3 so that I don't necessarily get doubled pawns. Also preparing castling.} Bb4+ {so now I either give up castling or submit to doubled pawns or a big swap off: not ideal when I've given up a pawn.} 6. Nbc3 Nxc3 7. bxc3 {retaking with the pawn to gain a tempo.  Doubled pawns can soon be sorted out and I've spotted a great square for the N.} Be7 8. cxd5 {sorting out my pawns and preparing my next manoeuvre} exd5 9. O-O {Preparing to occupy the open file and tucking my K away.} Bg4 {pinning the N, which delays my planned move to f4 but I have a useful move already prepared.} 10. Re1 O-O {getting out of the way of potential pins and preparing to contest the e-file} 11. Qc2 {unpinning the N and setting up my first attack on the K's position.} h6 {with the N ready to go to f4, perhaps not the best response.  11... g6 also looks unappealing, though, with White's QB ready to go to h6.  11...f5 is even less appealing when W can hit the Bg4 with 12. h3 and then pick off the f-pawn.} 12. Nf4 {threatening to win back the pawn with Nxd5 followed by Rxe7} c6 {so Black plays a natural defensive move, the drawback being that it deprive the Nb8 of its natural square} 13. h3 {forcing Black into an awkward choice: where to move the B?  Only d7 or c8 look safe but d7 deprives the N of another square and c8 is completely undeveloping.} Bd7 {Now Black has a serious problem trying to complete his development and White's kingside attack is almost ready.} 14. c4 {inviting ...} dxc4 15. Bxc4 {pinning the f-pawn and threatening Ng6} Bb4 {after a long think, removing the sting from the planned fork and attacking my R, which wants to move anyway ... Hang on, I still need to develop my DSB.  Now's my ideal opportunity, connecting my Rs} 16. Bd2 Bxd2 17. Qxd2 {It seems that White's pieces have been diverted from their attacking squares but it doesn't take long to put the pressure back on.} Qg5 {pinning the N and adopting an aggressive posture but inviting} 18. Re5 {I'd been planning the more modest lift to e3 but this asks the Q an immediate question.} Qf6 19. Rae1 {doubling the rooks is especially attractive with Black's N still on b8} b5 {trying to force the B off its powerful diagonal} 20. Bb3 a5 {and again, but these moves help me to reconfigure my attack on h7} 21. Nh5 {not only attacking the Q but preparing Re3-g3, which I couldn't play with the N on f4} Qd6 22. Re1e3 a4 23. Bc2 f6 24. Qd3 {Now, if Black took on e5, I planned to prosecute my attack regardless: 24... fxe5 25. Qh7  Kf7 26. Qxg7  Ke8 27. Rxe5  but I'm not sure what happens after 27... Kd8} f5 25. Rg3 {I have to work around Black's f-pawn now.  The immediate threat is 26. Rxg7 } Rf7 26. Nf4 {now I'm threatening 27. Rg6} g5 {Black finds an answer again...} 27. Qe3 {double-edged, as now I have to beware of allowing ...f4, forking Q and R} Kh8 {This made my planned continuation look more attractive, although it didn't end up giving me much of an advantage really} 28. Re8+ {!? Good shock value but I suspect it's not best ...} Bxe8 29. Qxe8+ Rf8 30. Ng6+ {I decide to keep Qs on in pursuit of the win} Kg7 31. Nxf8 Qxf8 {Now I fear that I've blown it.  My initiative is dribbling away and Black may soon be able to develop his QN and QR} 32. Qe5+ {I could have won back the pawn immediately by swapping Qs and taking on f5 but I preferred to maintain the pressure.  I was 40 minutes ahead on the clock.} Kg6 33. h4 Qf6 34. Bxf5+ Qxf5 {?? falling into my trap} 35. h5+ {! the K is overloaded and the Q falls.  Black resigned.}
