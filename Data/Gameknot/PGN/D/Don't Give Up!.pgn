[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {My favorite. King Pawn.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's  defense, I much prefer Nc6.} 3. Nc3 {Development.} c6 4. d4 Qe7 {? What's that for? To protect the pawn on e5? Why not Nd7?} 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. Be2 {Wanting to castle early, but Bc4 is probably better.} h6 {? A waste of a move, I wouldn't have wanted to play Bg5, so black was better off developing.} 7. O-O f5 {That opens it up a bit.} 8. exf5 Bxf5 {Finally! A developed piece.} 9. Re1 Nd7 10. h3 {Better is Be3.} O-O-O 11. Bd3 Bxd3 12. Qxd3 {Wanting to attack now, before black arranges his defense to suit his king.} Ngf6 {Black now has a decent position, except needs to develop his dark-squared bishop.} 13. Bf4 Qf7 {My next move is my almost-fatal mistake.} 14. Nxe5 {(?) I didn't see the threat of Rxd3 after Nxe5. So this almost lost me the game.} Nxe5 15. Qf5+ Ned7 {Now black has established a good position, and is up +2.} 16. Rad1 g6 17. Qd3 {I retreat.} Bb4 18. a3 Ba5 19. Qd2 {I don't understand this move.} Ne5 {Nice.} 20. Qe3 Nc4 {?} 21. Rxd8+ Rxd8 22. Qxa7 {Free pawn!} Nd5 {?} 23. Qb8+ {Free check!} Kd7 {After Qxb7+, black must defend with Nc7 or Bc7.} 24. Nxd5 {!! I have eliminated the piece that was needed to block the check of Qxb7+} Qxd5 {My plan all comes together, and with my next move, my opponent resigns.} 25. Qxb7+ {At one point, around move 19, I was going to resign, I think that's why I did Qd2, because I felt like resigning, I was unconfident and didn't really care about my move, so never give up, always go till the end!! It's not over until it IS over.}
