1. e4 {A friendly game I played on playchess.com.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {Usually black plays 4...Nf6 and 5...a6} 5. Nc3 Nf6 {The Sicilian Najdorf is my favourite reponse to 1.e4} 6. Bc4 e6 7. O-O Be7 8. Bg5 b5 9. Bb3 {Last 'bookmove'.} Bb7 {It's more common to castle here, but I decided to put some more pressure against the e4-pawn.} 10. Re1 {An interesting alternative variation would be 10. Bxe6!? fxe6 11. Nxe6 Qd7 12. Nxg7  Kf8 and white would surely have an advantage. Therefore I think 9...0-0 would have been better. } Nbd7 {Notice how 10... b4 11. Nd5 exd5 12. exd5 Bc8 13. Bxf6 gxf6 is good for white with good initiative. } 11. h3 {? Black has a cramped position, but this move allows him to get back in the game. 11. Bxe6 fxe6 12. Nxe6 would have been better I think. } b4 {I now feel that 11... Nc5 would have been a stronger option here. After for example 12.a3 black is slightly better.} 12. Na4 {12. Nd5!? exd5 13. Bxd5 Nxd5 14. exd5 looks interesting but I think black can hold here. } Nxe4 {?? Grabbing the pawn almost instantly, but 12... O-O secures black's position. } 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 {White is winning here. The e6-pawn is very weak, especially because the black king is still in the centre and the black queen isn't very well placed on e7.} 14. Qg4 {?? Too bad, this move doesn't really improve the position for white. 14.f3 looks almost winning to me. But let's not forget the time control here. Time flies when you're having fun!} Nef6 {Setting up a rather obvious trap. } 15. Qxg7 {??? White is lost now. 15. Qg3 was a good chance to save the game. 15...Nh5 16. Qe3 } Rg8 {!} 16. Qh6 Rxg2+ {Ouch..} 17. Kf1 Rg6 {17... Ne5 18. Qe3 Nfg4 19. hxg4 Qh4 is worth some further analysis. Looks complicated though and I was allready behind on time.} 18. Qh4 Bg2+ { } 19. Ke2 Ne5 {19... Nd5 Looks better. 20. Qxe7  Nxe7 21. a3  } 20. Reg1 { } Qb7 21. Rae1 {This is where I really had to think for a while to find a good move. The only problem is.....I didn't have the time! Maybe 21... Ne4 is the most accurate. For example 22. Kd1 Qa7 23. c3 bxc3 24. bxc3. But I decided to play the textmove instead wich actually isn't that strong.} Bf3+ 22. Kf1 {? 22. Kd2 Rxg1 23. Rxg1 was definitely white's best option here. } Bg2+ 23. Ke2 Bf3+ {? Twofold repetition. Gaining some time on the clock here. } 24. Kf1 {And thinking again...} Rxg1+ {Ofcourse...The white king is forced to the open g-file.} 25. Kxg1 Ke7 {Defending the knight and simultaneously allowing the rook to swing to g8.} 26. Qf4 {White could have gone for 26.Kh2 with something like Rg8 27. Rg1 Rxg1 28. Kxg1 } Rg8+ 27. Kh2 {?? 27. Kf1 [last chance.] Bh5 [Threatening mate on h1.] 28. f3 Bxf3 and now 29. Nc5 dxc5 30. Nf5  exf5 31. Qxe5  Kf8 32. Qxc5  Kg7 33. Re7 Bg2  34. Ke1 Qxe7 ! 35. Qxe7 Re8 should be no problem for black. } Rg2+ {Ofcourse white could have resigned here, but instead decides to fight 'till the end.} 28. Kh1 Rg4+ 29. Qxf3 Nxf3 30. hxg4 Nxe1+ 31. Kg1 {Dragon10 sportingly allows me to say a chess-player's favourite word: } Qg2# {'Checkmate!'.}
