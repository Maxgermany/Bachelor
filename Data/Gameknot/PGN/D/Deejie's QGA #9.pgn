1. d4 {I am going to attempt to annotate my own game here to see why I lost.  This is my first annotation.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 {Up to this point the moves had already been made for the mini-tournament.  Queen's Gambit Accepted.  This is my first game using this opening.} 3. e4 {I decided to establish a presence in the center.} b5 {He is protecting his c-pawn and limiting my white bishop.} 4. a4 {I apply pressure to his b-pawn.} Bd7 {He prepares for the possible attack, which would also protect his c-pawn if we exchanged pawns here.} 5. Nc3 {This seems to be a poor move.  I thought to attack his b-pawn and protect the center.} b4 {Knight forced to move.} 6. Nd5 e6 {Knight just not getting a break.} 7. Ne3 {He's safe here.} c3 8. bxc3 bxc3 9. Bc4 {Preparing to castle kingside.} Bb4 10. Nc2 {Blockade the pawn and attack the bishop.} Ba5 11. Nf3 h6 {He prevents movement on to g5.} 12. O-O {Protect the king.} Ne7 13. Re1 O-O 14. d5 {Opening thrust in the center is premature.  I needed to develop more pieces first.} exd5 15. exd5 Bg4 {Knight gets pinned.} 16. Bf4 Re8 17. d6 cxd6 18. Bxd6 {Center pawns are gone.  Very open game now.} Nf5 19. Be5 {I think Rxe8  was probably a better move, followed by Be5.} Nc6 20. Qxd8 {I see I am losing a positional battle, so I decided to remove some pieces.  Not sure what else to do here.} Raxd8 21. h3 Bxf3 22. gxf3 {I didn't see much choice in the matter here, so now my king has a huge hole in his defenses.} Rxe5 23. Rxe5 Nxe5 24. Bb3 {From here on I mainly played for time, not seeing anything that would help me unless he made a mistake.} Nxf3+ 25. Kh1 Rb8 26. Bd5 Rb2 27. Be4 Nf5d4 28. Nxd4 Nxd4 29. Rc1 c2 {I resigned here as I would be down too much material.}
