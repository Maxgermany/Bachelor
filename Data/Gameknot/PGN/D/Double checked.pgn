1. d4 e6 2. Bf4 d6 3. Nf3 Kd7 {?? My opponent seems to play fool (a strategy seldom used, but still possible), or it was a slip? I didn't ask, he didn't say.} 4. e4 {My plan is to block the center and then attack it with c4. } h6 {More fool moves?} 5. e5 {Probably a positional blunder. As I said, I planned to break in with c4, but I'm not saying this was the right plan. } d5 6. h4 {Just in case, let's block the kingside. } g6 7. a3 {Despite g6, the dsb can still check on b4, and I don't like this grimp. So, if I want to play c4, I have to cover b4 first. If he goes Bg7, well, I'll lost a tempo, but also will he. } Bg7 {Aha. Wonderful position for the bishop (for me). } 8. c4 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 {I would have taken with the other pawn. } 10. Qa4+ Nc6 11. Bb5 {If a6, the bishop cannot be taken because of the R in a8. } g5 {I told you the kingside was blocked, so why do you insist?} 12. hxg5 hxg5 13. Rxh8 Bxh8 14. Nxg5 {Better than Bxg5, f6. } a6 {My opponent doesn't see the threat.} 15. Nxf7 Qh4 16. g3 {Now, I have to bet I can survive the black queen harassing my king, but I had the feeling he could. } Qh1+ 17. Ke2 Qe4+ 18. Be3 Qg4+ 19. Kd2 {End of checks, everything covered. The knight wasn't forked by a queen's check. } Bg7 20. Nc3 {I underestimated the direct BxN, then Qb4, threatening Qd6+. } Nge7 21. Be2 {Time to swap pieces on b5. } Qg6 22. Nd6 {Wonderful outpost for my Knight. } Bh6 23. Rh1 {I again decided to bet I could survive to BxB, KxB. } Bxe3+ 24. Kxe3 Nf5+ 25. Nxf5 Qxf5 {Still save. } 26. Rh5 {Covering an inmediate queen's check. } Qf7 27. Nb5 {Second piece throwing into the pinned rook. My knight will replace the other one on d6, with tempo. } Ke7 28. Nd6 {Nc7 was tempting, but all the time black had the chanche to play Rb8, depriving me of b5's control... why help him?} Qg6 29. Bf3 {In case I had to move the knight, no Qe4+ will bother me. It was a mistake. Rh8 was the strong move, threatening Re8+.} Bd7 30. Qb3 {I had the feeling that Nxb8 would have lost to Nxe5, threatening the queen. I thought this was smart.} Na5 31. Qb4 {Now it is MY queen the one threatening a discovered check. Double. } Nc6 {He got into it. Now, am I right (on a blitz) to consider the next move as winning?} 32. Nf5+ {Black can move Kf7, and I have only Nd6+, and I cannot find a way to win. But this move was so spectacular... :-)} Kd8 {This gives me some more chances. Qd6 and black cannot take the knight because after exN, QxQ. White is threatening Rh8, so... it was the strong one. Qb6+ was also good: Kmoves, Nf6+, but I cannot figure out if it really wins. } 33. Rh8+ {If Be8, Qxb7, forking the rook and the knight. Rc8, Nd6 is deadly. }
