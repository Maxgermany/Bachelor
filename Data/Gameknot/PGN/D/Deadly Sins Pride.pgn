[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 c6 {A bit of a waiting move; my preferred response to White's choice of opening. Depending on whether White plays c4 or e4, this can transpose into either the Slav or the Caro-Kann, both very solid lines for Black. } 2. Nf3 {White puts off making the choice of c4 vs e4, though this historically signals a preference for c4. } g6 {?! Not unseen, but not standard either. 2...Nf6 is seen more often. The issue with this move is generally that it blocks up more of Black's light squares--his LSB is frequently difficult to develop in this opening even without this extra blockage. } 3. c4 d5 4. e3 {We've arrived at a Slav defense, if a little nonstandard. White should have very little trouble developing, whereas Black will be looking for an eventual break through the center to mobilize his forces. } Bf5 5. Nc3 Bg7 {Probably 5.Nf6 was more accurate, to defend d5 a bit more thoroughly. } 6. cxd5 cxd5 7. Bb5+ {Developing with tempo. } Nc6 8. Qa4 {A bit dangerous to bring the Queen out so early, but White's got a lead in both space and development so it's up to Black to prove there's anything wrong with this. } Bd7 {Black has no good way to hold on to the d-pawn (again, Nf6 at any point before this would have helped greatly), so he drops it in exchange for a bit of freedom and chances at counterplay. } 9. Nxd5 a6 {This threat is actually a bluff, but it's not an obvious one. If Black takes 10...axb5, White will win an exchange after 11.Qxa8! Qxa8 12.Nc7+, regaining the Queen with superior position and a Rook for a Bishop. } 10. Be2 {? White is fooled by the bluster, and retreats--e2 is the best square for the Bishop to land on, but now his Queen is lined up against Black's Bishop and tactics are in the air. Probably best were 10.Qa3 or 10.O-O. } Nxd4 {! Seizing the opportunity, Black reclaims his pawn, opens the long diagonal for his KB and is about to trade off White's good Bishop to boot (after 11.Qd1 Nxe2 12.Qxe2). } 11. Qc4 {? This error is more subtle than the last--and much more devastating. Now instead of a strong position, Black can sweep up a concrete material advantage thanks to the WQ's lack of mobility. } Rc8 {! Winning big material. White's obvious tries all fail quickly and miserably to a fork on c2. } 12. exd4 {! White finds the best response. 12.Qd3 would keep the Queen at the cost of giving Black the Ra1 for free, but this loses the least material: White gets a Rook and Knight for a Queen and pawn. } Rxc4 13. Bxc4 Bc6 {Allowing Black to pick up the d-pawn with the Queen, and preparing to blast open White's kingside. } 14. Ne3 Bxf3 15. gxf3 Qxd4 16. O-O e6 {Stifling White's active Bishop, though probably 16...Nf6 would be more accurate. } 17. Rd1 {Strong. } Qb6 {17...Qf4 is probably better; the text is a bit passive. } 18. Bd2 Ne7 {Taking the b-pawn is just greedy. Black needs to castle and get his pieces into the game--at the moment he's technically ahead, but White's mobility is vastly superior so it doesn't even matter. } 19. Rab1 O-O 20. b4 {Claiming more space and freeing up some troubling weaknesses. } Bd4 21. a4 Nf5 22. a5 Qa7 {22...Qc6 was better; at the time I wanted to keep up the pressure along the a7-g1 diagonal but Black should be using his Queen to create threats all over the board, rather than trying to force any one particular break. Black's next several moves reflect this bad thinking--there's a definite advantage, but he's just not making the right kind of choices with his extra power. } 23. Rde1 Nh4 24. Be2 f5 25. Ref1 f4 26. Nc2 Be5 27. Rb3 b5 {Freeing the Queen at long last. Black's KR is *still* not really in the game. } 28. axb6 e.p. Qxb6 29. Na3 {?? Big mistake--subtle as usual. Black can pick up the DSB for free now with 29...Qd8! where White can't spare time to defend his Bishop on d2 because of the threat of ...Qg5+ Kh1 Qg2#. } Bb8 {? See my note above; 29...Qd8 was far better. The next is just passive--again, Black is using his resources the wrong way; he should be focusing on multiple attacks and threats. } 30. Nc4 Qc6 31. Rc1 Qd5 {Black slowly creeps his Queen towards g5. } 32. Rd3 {?? White allows it, and despite Black's reticence, he finally gets to plant his Queen where she belongs. } Qg5+ 33. Kf1 Qg2+ 34. Ke1 Ba7 {Too early, and therefore too weak. 34...Qg1+ 35.Bf1 first would allow Black to threaten ...Ng2+ Kd1 Qxf1+. The text allows the WK to flee to relative safety on the queenside. } 35. Kd1 Bxf2 36. Ne5 Qg1+ {? It's too late for this now; Black needs to regroup, get his Knight out of the corner. This just chases White's King off to where he wants to go anyway. From here on, Black continues to play just inaccurately enough--too comfortable with his perceived lead to actually capitalize on it. } 37. Kc2 Rc8+ 38. Bc3 Qxh2 39. Ng4 Qg3 40. Nh6+ {? I think White actually had a draw by repetition here with 40.Kb2 (getting out of the way of a Rook sacrifice check on c3), followed by Rd7 and Nf6+ Kf8 Nxh7+ Ke8 Kf6+ etc. } Kf8 41. Rcd1 Qg5 42. Ng4 Be3 {Inaccuracy after inaccuracy. Black needs to play ...e5 and solidify his position. } 43. Kb3 a5 {? The draw opportunity for White was gone, but Black gives it back to him. Nothing can stop the perpetual check (besides a ruinous sacrifice, that is) after 44.Bf6 Qf5 45.Rd8+ Rxd8 46.Rxd8+ Kf7 47.Rd7+ Ke8 48.Rd8+ etc. } 44. Bf6 a4+ {Merely postponing the inevitable. } 45. Kxa4 Qh5 {? And suddenly, Black is not only drawn despite his material lead, but lost altogether. Failing to keep the Bishop under guard will allow White to play an eventual Ne5 and Black will have to drop his Queen to prevent mate. } 46. Rd3d8+ Rxd8 47. Rxd8+ Kf7 48. Rd7+ Kf8 {1-0. Black makes it easy on himself and moves without looking at the consequences: it's mate in two after 49.Bg7+ Ke8 50.Nf6# (or 49...Kg8 50.Nf6#). Black's continuous assessment of the situation as 'winning' despite his position's obvious flaws led him to a series of inaccurate moves and, eventually, a totally needless loss. As the saying goes, 'Pride goeth before a fall.'  Many thanks to toughplaya for the fantastic game! I'll be annotating the second game in this match soon. As always, thanks for reading, and comments are much appreciated! }
