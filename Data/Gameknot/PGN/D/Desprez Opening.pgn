1. h4 {h4?! played by me. I always feel i should try something new which no-one else usually does, so i went for the Desprez opening. The opening is named after the French player Marcel Desprez. Like a number of other rare openings, 1.h4 has some alternate names such as "Kadas Opening", "Anti-Borg Opening", "Samurai Opening", and "Reagan's Attack". Gabor Kadas is a Hungarian player. According to Eric Schiller's Unorthodox Chess Openings, the latter name is because 1.h4 is "thoroughly unmotivated and creates weaknesses with only vague promises of future potential", a political gibe against Ronald Reagan.  Like 1.a4, the Ware Opening, 1.h4 is an irrelevant pawn move which does nothing in the fight over central space, and does very little for development. The only piece released is the rook, and this piece is usually not developed by moving it to h3. In addition, 1.h4 weakens White's kingside. For all of these reasons, 1.h4 is among the rarest of the twenty possible first moves for White.  } e5 {Black usually responds by grabbing the center with 1...d5 or 1...e5, and simple and sound development by 1...Nf6 is also possible. However, 1...g6, intending to fianchetto Black's bishop on g7, is rare because White can undermine Black's pawn structure with 2.h5, making 1.h4 seem like a logical move.  } 2. g3 {g3 opens c6-g2 diagonal for Bishop and protects h4.} Bc5 {Simple developing move for black.} 3. e3 {e3 blocks threat and prepares for a d2-d4 or f2-f4 advance.} Nf6 {Again, a nice development move for black, taking control of the center.} 4. Bg2 {Bishop is fianchettoed and takes the nice long diagonal.} d5 {Black takes control of the center with d5.} 5. f4 {Whites attack e5, trying to rip it from the center.} e4 {Black moves e4, advancing into my territory. However, black missed Bg4!! wins queen.} 6. Nh3 {Actually, to be honest i didn't see it coming, so i played a simple developing move.} Bg4 {Bg4!! wins queen, and i've kinda lost. It's quite a closed position so i decided to play on the flanks.} 7. O-O {I castled, now rook is protecting the lost queen. I think though, my wing pawn structure, is quite nice. Don't you?} Bxd1 8. Rxd1 {We knew this exchange was going to come.} Nc6 {Another developing move for black.} 9. d3 {Attacking e4 now.} Nb4 {Nb4! I can't save both my rook on a1 and pawn on c3, so i chose o lose the pawn.} 10. a4 {Creating an escape route for the rook.} Nxc2 11. Ra2 Ng4 {Black Knight on g4 sits comfortably on g4, trying reduce squares for my king in a possible mate.} 12. Nc3 Bxe3+ 13. Bxe3 Ngxe3 {Exchange of bishops was forced.} 14. Rd2 {Moving the rook out of danger.} Nb4 {Attacking my rook on a2-again.} 15. Ra3 Nxd3 16. Bxe4 {Bxe4! black didn't see my plan to come.} dxe4 17. Nxe4 {Now protection from knights is gone, and an attack on them from a3 has come.} Nc4 18. Raxd3 {Here  i was stupid, because i was so engaged with my plan, i didn't see the attack on my rook on d2.} Qe7 {Had to move queen out the way.} 19. Nhg5 {Ng5?? lost a rook! However, i was protecting my undefended knight on e4 from the queen.} Nxd2 20. Rxd2 h6 {h6! wins my knight i believe.} 21. Nc5 {Knight for a pawn exchange is to come.} Qxc5+ {Ok, i was stupid not to see that. Now i've lost BOTH knights for nothing. Nc5??} 22. Kg2 hxg5 23. fxg5 {I took with f4 as i didn't want that rook on h8 to get an open file so a checkmate was going to come.  Just in-case you wanted to know, here are some other names for the h4 opening: Kadas Opening, Anti-Borg Opening, Samurai Opening, and Reagan's Attack  There are five named variations in the Desprez Opening:  The Koola-Koola continues 1...a5.  The Wulumulu continues 1...e5 2. d4  The Crab Variation continues 1...any 2. a4.  The Borg Gambit continues 1...g5.  The Symmetric Variation continues 1...h5.   N.B. I am not lying about any of these!  Grandmaster David Bronstein once remarked that he knew of a Russian player who always opened 1.h4 and always won. His point was that after 1. ...e5 2.g3 d5 3.d4! exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 5.Qd1 Nf6 6.Nh3! Be7 7.Nf4 0-0 8.Bg2 the f4 knight is well placed and White has a good position. However, Black does not have to be so cooperative.  As the Desprez Opening is very rare, it is considered an irregular opening, so it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.  } O-O 24. Kh3 Rad8 25. h5 Rxd2 {Oh dear! Another blunder by me. Let's play a game. In how many moves will it be checkmate? I think by move 30 what about you?} 26. b4 {I have played the Evans Gambit against a queen not a bishop, 22 moves late! Aren't gambits supposed to give you a positional advantage, i can't how this will work...} Qf5+ 27. g4 Qxg5 {Qxg5? balgul2 could have checkmated with 27...Qf3+! 28 Kh4 Rh2#} 28. b5 {I just felt like pushing this pawn up, hoping balgul2 would somehow mysteriously blunder making it promote to a queen.} b6 {b6? why not just try to checkmate hugomason (me) quickly? Finish me off please!} 29. Kg3 {I don't want to exchange off any pawns, so i think this was really the only move i could do.} Rd3+ 30. Kf2 Qxg4 31. h6 gxh6 32. a5 {I push up my pawns, because i don't want my king on the back row for a quick mate.} Qf3+ 33. Kg1 Re8 34. axb6 {Come on pawn! promote!} cxb6 35. Kh2 {Only move i could do now.} Re2+ 36. Kg1 Rd1# {Simple mate finished me off. I guess we've learnt-don't do h4 as your opening please. If your opponent does-have a party!}
