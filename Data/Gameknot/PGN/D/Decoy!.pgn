1. d4 Nf6 {1. ........ Nf6 - the most popular reply to d4.  This game seems a non event, but a decoy tactic at the end livens it up and I hope will whet your appetite for the tactical melee game against patzerblitzer.} 2. e3 g6 3. c3 Bg7 4. Nf3 O-O 5. Nbd2 d5 6. Ne5 Nbd7 {6. ......... Nbd7 - challenges the e5 knight.} 7. f4 Nxe5 8. fxe5 Nd7 9. Bd3 Nb6 10. O-O Be6 {10........... Be6 - my position seems rather cramped, but I somehow manage to get round the problem.} 11. e4 c6 12. Nf3 dxe4 13. Bxe4 f6 14. exf6 exf6 15. Bc2 Qd7 {15.......... Qd7 - quite a transformation from the position on move 10.  My development is now complete and I have managed to uncramp myself.} 16. Bf4 Nd5 17. Bd2 Rfe8 18. c4 Nc7 19. Bb3 b6 20. Bf4 Qf7 21. Bxc7 Qxc7 22. Re1 Bf7 23. Qd2 Rxe1+ 24. Rxe1 {24. Rxe1 - one pair of rooks has been exchange and I now contest the e file.} Re8 25. d5 Rxe1+ 26. Qxe1 cxd5 27. cxd5 Qc5+ {27. ......... Qc5  - ganging up on the passed c pawn.  For once I decline an invitation to swap queens!!!} 28. Qf2 Qc1+ 29. Ne1 f5 {29. .......... f5, sneaky, sneaky, sneaky, it looks as though I am merely threatening the b pawn, but little does white know I am threatening something far more deadly.} 30. d6 {30. d6?? - white is so pre-occupied with pushing his passer that he misses this deadly move .......} Bd4 {30 ........... Bd4!! - this move forces instant resignation as the white queen is pinned to the king.  If the queen captures the bishop then white cops Old Matey on e1 by 31........ Qxe1#.  This is an example of a pin/decoy.}
