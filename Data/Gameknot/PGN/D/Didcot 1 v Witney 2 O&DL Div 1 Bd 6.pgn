[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70)"]

1. e4 {As usual, I aim for an open game.} e5 {Not something I see OTB very often as most opponents these days opt for semi-open lines like the French or Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Be7 {An unusual move order.  4... b5 or 4....Nf6 are much more common.} 5. O-O {I castle anyway, not seeing any new opportunities or dangers offered by the odd move order.} b5 6. Bb3 Nf6 7. Re1 O-O {We've now transposed back into a main line Ruy Lopez Orthodox Defence, with Black still having the option of launching Marshall's Gambit.  Anti-Marshall moves include an early a4 or h3.  } 8. h3 {Recently, I've been using the latter, even though it does offer Black the chance to force the swap of my LSB by playing ..Na5 before I've provided the B with an escape route.} d6 {So now Black plays the more conservative 8...d6.  An immediate 8...Na5 would have given away the pawn on e5.  8...d5 is now less effective with g4 unavailable for Black's LSB or N.} 9. c3 {and now I have time to create my bolthole for my B.} Na5 10. Bc2 {This B has now made 4 out of the first 10 moves, which seems to go against all opening principles but it has also caused Black to use at least 3 moves to push it back, including putting his knight on the rim, where it is dim ... Now the B bolsters e4 and points indirectly at Black's castled position, with plenty of potential for effectiveness later in the game.  The Ruy Lopez is typically a slowly developing game with plenty of potential attacks forthcoming, once White has established his pieces on good squares.  } c5 {Typically, Black plays to restrict the power of White's threatened central thrust.  Black usually follows up by recentralising the QN and developing Q and B.} 11. d4 {I play the pawn thrust anyway.  I've been experimenting on Gameknot recently with lines involving d3 first, in the fashion of Michael Adams, but I don't have his skill in strangling opponents and often end up too cramped myself.} exd4 {?!  Surprising and, I think, not very good, as it unleashes my e-pawn.  I'd expected either 11...Nc6 or 11...cxd4.} 12. cxd4 Re8 {Clearly the point of Black's previous move: Black contests the e-file with this rook and probably plans to redevelop his DSB on g7.} 13. Nbd2 {Even though c3 was now available for this N, I preferred to perform the standard Nbd2-f1-g3 manoeuvre, as on c3 it would be attacked by ...b4 and either have to retreat to e2, blocking my R's file, or advance prematurely to a4 or d5.} Bf8 {Black continues his plan and I continue with  mine ...} 14. Nf1 Qb6 {!?  This took me by surprise but I couldn't see any advantage to this over the more normal ...Qc7 or continuing with redeploying the DSB.  Later in the game, though, the Q provided a useful defence of Black's third row from here.} 15. Ng3 g6 16. e5 {I decided to make this thrust before I'd completed my development as Black's QN and DSB were still out of position.} dxe5 17. dxe5 {Recapturing with the N wouldn't have been much use as Black would have taken the pawn on d4 with impunity.} Rd8 {I'd expect Black to retreat the N to d7 immediately.  This forces me to decide between blocking the attack with a piece or moving my Q to e2.  I'd rather not self-pin, if I can avoid it, so ...} 18. Qe2 Nd5 {I'd expected ...Nd7 but this more active continuation covers two of the best squares for my DSB} 19. Bg5 {I take advantage of Black's 17th by attacking the Rd8 while developing my last minor piece.} Be7 {and, surprisingly again, Black changes plan by blocking the attack with his DSB and attacking my DSB.} 20. Rad1 {In the interest of completing my development, I was happy to allow Black to swap on g5, whereupon my N would take up an attacking position and give the f3 square to my Q, thus forcing Black to defend f7.  I felt that my position was building up nicely into a good platform for a devastating kingside assault.} Bxg5 21. Nxg5 Be6 {A good developing move, defending f7 into the bargain.} 22. Ng3e4 {I planned to play Nf6+ and, if Black captured with the Nd5, exf6, providing potential for later delivering mate on g7 or at least using the threat to win material.} Nc4 {! Black activates the QN, forking the pawns on b2 and e5.  Now came my longest think of the game as I calculated several different lines and move orders.  Eventually I decided to sac the e5 pawn with a view to prosecuting my attack and winning back material later if I couldn't deliver mate.} 23. b3 Nxe5 24. Nf6+ Nxf6 25. Qxe5 Nd7 {For some reason I had overlooked this, so I had to don the thinking cap again.} 26. Qe2 {I don't remember what the reasoning was that led to this move.  Looking at it afresh, I think 24. Qf4 might have been better} Nf8 27. Ne4 Bf5 {This seems a good move, skewering Ne5 and Bc2 while defending f6 with the Q.} 28. Qf3 {A good square ... eying the Ra8, should Black disconnect his rooks and building the pressure on f6 and f7.} Rac8 29. Qg3 {Now I was looking at putting R or N on d6 and penetrating on the dark squares with my Q.  Both this move and the previous one would have been unnecessary if I'd played 26. Qf4, though Black would soon have threatened to shift my Q with 26. ...Nf8 and 27. ...Ne6.} Rxd1 30. Bxd1 {Relieving the skewer and maintaining the R on the e-file.} Rd8 {This move overloads my R.} 31. Bg4 {Threatening the win the B because its defending pawn will be pinned.} Bxg4 {So Black swapped the Bs.} 32. hxg4 {32. Qxg4 would have been met by 32. ...f5! forking N and Q.} c4 {Black opens the diagonal to my f-pawn and Kg1 while threatening to march this pawn to promotion} 33. bxc4 bxc4 {At least this advanced pawn is now isolated but I have to keep it under surveillance.} 34. g5 {Taking control of f6 and h6 with my doubled pawn.  With Black's N on f8, I couldn't see a way of forcing mate yet but felt that I would be able to win back my pawn by attacking directly.} Rd3 {Counter-attack! ... but this merely forces me to move my Q and I find a good square for her.} 35. Qe5 {hoping to be able to play Nf6+ followed by Nd7 discovered check and picking up Black's Q.} Nd7 36. Nf6+ {That dream had been foiled but other attacking options sprang to mind.} Nxf6 37. gxf6 {At last I have a pawn established on f6 and threaten mate in one.} h5 38. Qe8+ Kh7 39. Qxf7+ {I've won the pawn back at last and have a potentially mating attack, backed up by an advanced passed pawn.} Kh6 40. Qg7+ Kg5 41. Re5+ Kh4 {unexpectedly avoiding the opportunity to attack my R with ...Kf4.  Now I sank deep into thought again, worrying that I had to continue delivering check until I could mate him, in the mistaken belief that failing to do so might allow him to deliver mate himself.} 42. Qe7 {?? played in a suddenly defensive frame of mind, brought on by the feeling that I'd kept missing things and I couldn't afford to allow myself to be mated.  I should simply have captured g6 and, if Black checked on my back row, played Kh2, where the K would have been safe long enough to allow me to deliver mate on g5 or h5} Rd1+ 43. Re1 Rxe1+ 44. Qxe1 Qxf6 45. f3+ {looks clever but doesn't win the pawn back.  Simply 45. Qe4+ would have rounded up the c-pawn, and then defended a2 and attacked a6} Kg5 46. Qc1+ Qf4 47. Qa3 Qd4+ {and, short of time, Black offered the draw, which I gladly accepted, knowing that I'd blown a winning position but not, at that time, knowing exactly how or when.  I was a nervous wreck for several minutes after this, but reassured as my colleagues' results came in.  We were 3-2 up with just the top board in progress and looking good for a draw when I left.}
