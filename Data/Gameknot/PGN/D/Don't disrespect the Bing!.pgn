1. d4 {ok, ok........just to prove that I don't just annotate my wins, here is an example of how I get absolutely crushed by my good friend mbingham. Feeling a little too confident with my own very meager skills at the chessboard, I challenge my friend to a *ahem* "friendly" game. I learn that mbingham is NOT just the goofy guy I hang around with at OTB tourneys - he is in reality an attacking hit man! In this game, I have the black pieces. After the opening, I feel a little under-developed but otherwise ok. It looks like I will have a little counterplay. Then my opponent launches into an attack that leaves my king feeling like Big Puss in that scene where he gets whacked on the boat. Three gunmen with weapons drawn and nowhere to run! This one is very pretty - I hope you enjoy:)} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {I go ahead and get into Nimzo-Indian territory. I'm looking to castle quick and then fight it out on the queenside.} 4. Qc2 d5 {A little premature, maybe, but the Nimzo has so many numerous possibilities of move transposition that I hope to come out the opening equal. One of the main reasons I played 4...d5 here was to show my opponent that his 400 point rating advantage over me was not intimidating to me at all, and I was prepared to meet him head on! (lol - it's ok to laugh at me.... these are the type of little comments that run through my brain when playing chess against stronger players:)} 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 c5 {Committing to queenside play.} 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 b6 9. cxd5 {And here we have the classic Nimzo-Indian. White has removed black's dark squared bishop and wants to press his central pawn advantage. Black has secured his king and is looking to press his queenside pawn advantage.} Nxd5 {? After looking through the 1900  database, I learned that 9...exd was the correct play, as it would have cleared a lane for my light squared bishop. This game just left the "book".} 10. Bd3 {! Putting a double tap on h7, developing, and preparing to castle. A very multi-purpose move. At this point I realized that my last move was weak. } g6 {Gotta protect my h pawn. The only real problem with that idea is that I have now opened up the dark squares for my opponent to attack, and he still has his dark squared bishop and I don't have mine. I started to get that sinking feeling that some misery was coming my way, and put myself into a defensive mindset. In retrospect, I realize that this kind of thinking is dangerous so early. I've been psyched out! Call Dr. Melfi !!!} 11. e4 {Of course. Harrasses the knight and makes a strong play for the inevitable e5!} Nc7 {I picked Nh7 over Nf6 thinking f5 may just be the site of our next shootout, and I didn't want to restrict my f pawn.  Keep in mind I'm still thinking defense, and want to go ahead and push my kingside pawns and rush pieces behind them. I realize now that this theory is flawed, and that I need to up my Prozac.} 12. e5 {White claims a nice spacial advantage and is preparing to coordinate an assault on my compound.} Bb7 {Rushing to catch up in development, and trying to come up with a plan to start something on the queenside that will distract my good friend from my weakened castled position.} 13. Bh6 {Oh geez.....here it comes.} Re8 14. Bg5 Qc8 {With the idea of clearing the c file ASAP and attacking the rear echelon of the oncoming attack.} 15. Nh4 {! Beautiful. I expected 15. Bf6 and then an h pawn push. My rival sees something that I miss - a knight sac on g6! If accepted, white will have his queen and dark squared bishop hammering down on my isolated king.} Nc6 {? I had to do something to get developed, but this was a poor choice. I think 15...Nd7 would have been better, with the idea of action on f6. } 16. Nxg6 {! BAM! At this point I see the fallacy of taking the knight, and start to get the inkling of an idea. I end up picking up material, but didn't plan far enough ahead. It's the whole hind sight is 20/20 thing I know, but I was kind of proud of the way the following combination worked out.} cxd4 {The first move of a five move combination. While I achieve my goal of eliminating one of those pesky central pawns, and accomplish that little picture in my head, it is simply too little too late. About 5 moves ahead is my limit in tactical considerations, and my friend mbingham proves that he can see just a little bit further:)} 17. Nf4 {I think I caught my opponent a little off guard by not accepting the bait. So, white simply protects his knight and plans to play Bxh7 , which was probably his aim as far back as move 10.} Nxe5 {Move 2 of the combination.  I have now "won" the other pesky central pawn.} 18. Bxh7+ {As intended.} Kf8 {Move 3 of the combination. 18...Kh8 loses the Ne4 after 19. Bf6 !} 19. cxd4 {Picks up a pawn and threatens the Ne5.} Bxg2 {! Move 4 of the combination. I give myself the ! for the following reasons - 1) I'm not scared of a check by his dark squared bishop as I can easily evade to e7, which opens up my back rank for my major pieces to get mobile and swing over to the kingside to defend, and 2) black MUST take my Ne5 next move, because of the threat Nf3  which will win white's Bg5 AND could bring my queen into play via a6, which could be very painful for white. When white takes out my Ne5, I win a rook on move 20...BxR:)} 20. dxe5 {White sees all of this I'm sure, and plays along. He still has more than enough ammo directed at my king to perform the hit.} Bxh1 {Move 5 of my little combo, and I have achieved my goal. I'm still in a boatload of trouble, but it did feel good to see this work out as I envisioned it..............} 21. Ng6+ {............! but I didn't envision this one! It was just a little beyond my horizon. White now has a beautiful mating net which involves four of his pieces vs. my lone king. While I hate losing as much as the next guy, it really was cool to be involved in such a pretty mate:)} Kg7 {Forced.} 22. Bf6+ Kh6 {22...KxB would be followed by 23. Ne7  which loses my queen.} 23. Qd2+ Kxh7 {23...Kh5 would be followed by 24. Ne4  forcing me to move even closer to the grave.} 24. Qg5 {Threatening 25. Qh5  Kg8 26. Qh8#} Bf3 {Last ditch effort to protect h5.} 25. Nf8+ {White shows that h5 is not even a consideration. Mate in 1.} Rxf8 {Forced.} 26. Qg7# {Bada BING! I humbly kiss the ring of my Godfather. If I gotta get whacked, I wanna get whacked like that! As for the Sopranos references - I just happen to be watching the latest episode as I annotate this:) Many thanks to mbingham for the lesson. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas}
