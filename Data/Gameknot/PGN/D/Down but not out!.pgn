1. e4 {Hi everyone!  While contemplating playing in Master Freddy's Traxler Tournament and dropping 40 something rating points on Black Friday I feel in need of some dire inspiration so that when I do join the tournament I put up a jolly good show especially as Coach Ion is also playing in it.  I recalled my second ever game - an unrated game - with my buddy Dmaestro from the Coaching Club shortly after I went through The Big Slump.  In the middle game I was down a piece for a pawn and looked out.  But somehow things did not quite work out like that.  Ah well, dmaestro gives me the Lion Variation of the Philidor's Defense.  The Lion Variation can also arise out of the Pirc.} d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 {3. ....... Nbd7 - this move is the start of the Lion.} 4. f4 {4. f4 - creating an impressive looking pawn centre but it soon gets busted.} e5 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. fxe5 {6. fxe5 - double pawn trade.} Nxe5 7. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {7. ....... Kxd8 - now a queen trade.} 8. Bg5 c6 9. O-O-O+ {9. 0-0-0 - castles and checks the opponent's king and puts his king knight in a pin.  So far so good.} Kc7 10. Bxf6 gxf6 {10. ...... gxf6 - I seem to have a big bee in my bonnet about exchanging B for N to bust up my opponent's pawn structure.} 11. Be2 Bh6+ 12. Kb1 Rg8 13. g3 f5 14. Rf1 {14. Rf1 - maybe Nf3 was better here.} fxe4 15. Nxe4 {15. Nxe4 - pawn trade.} Be6 16. Nf3 Ng4 {16. ...... Ng4 - my knight does go to f3 but Ng4 looks nasty.} 17. Nd4 Bd5 18. Bxg4 Rxg4 19. Nf6 {19. Nf6 - looks good but ......} Rxd4 20. Nxd5+ Rxd5 21. Rxf7+ Rd7 22. Rxd7+ Kxd7 {22. ...... Kxd7 - ..... after the smoke has cleared I find myself down a piece for a pawn.  I could resign here but my eyes keep focussed on that 2 - 1 kingside pawn majority.  Maybe if I could create a passer over there I might stand some ghost of a chance.  Firstly some king safety, I create a luft for Henry on a2 which is a square not controlled by dmaestro's dsb.} 23. a3 Rf8 24. Rg1 {24. Rg1 - stage 1 - this rook supports my g pawn and now I push those kingside pawns closer and closer to Glendadom.} Rf2 25. h4 {25. h4 - here we go, here we go, here we go!} Bd2 26. g4 Ke6 27. g5 {27. g5 - onwards and upwards.} Kf5 28. Rg3 Ke6 {28. ....... Ke6 - strange retreat, surely Kf5 would have been far better here.} 29. g6 hxg6 30. Rxg6+ Kd7 {30. ...... Kd7 - after the pawn trade another puzzling move, surely Kf5 is better.  Now that h pawn does become a threat!} 31. h5 Rh2 32. Rg7+ {32. Rg7+ - this rook move hits at the b2 pawn and enables a rook move to h2 protecting that weak yet strong passer isolani on the h column.} Kc8 33. Rh7 a6 34. Ka1 {34. Ka1 - a waiting move.} Bg5 35. Kb1 Rh1+ 36. Ka2 {36. Ka2 - so that decision to play a3 on move 23 proved to be a very wise one indeed.} Rd1 37. h6 {37. h6 - now my pawn takes another step forward, just two little squares from becoming the footman come Drag Queen!} Rd8 38. Kb3 {38. Kb3 - whoa, a brave show from Henry.  I have c3 in mind and that will provide a nice cosy little nest for the old codger.} Bf6 39. Rf7 Be5 40. h7 {40. h7 - make it 1 step away from Glendadom!} Bh8 41. c3 {41. c3 - here is the nest!} Kb8 42. Kc2 Ka7 43. a4 Kb6 44. a5+ {44. a5+ - this seems to give away a pawn but in fact if the BK takes it then the b7 pawn will drop and suddenly dmaestro's queenside pawns will become very weak and that little pawn on h7 will prove to be a handy decoy indeed.} Kxa5 45. Rxb7 Be5 46. b4+ {46. b4+ - maybe I can force a further pawn trade here.  You would not believe, however that 2 moves down the line dmaestro will be copping Old Matey would you?} Ka4 47. Rb6 {47. Rb6 - those black a and c pawns, suddenly they become absolute sitting ducks to that piggish white rook.  They could certainly grace Henry's table tonight after Glenda cooks them with a few herbs in her brand new cauldron!} Ka3 {47. ...... Ka3 - what's this, what's this?  At this stage I did not know how to use analyse the board but I could see that Rxa6 looked good.  Indeed it was.  Dmaestro's king got well and truly caught in the corridor.  What an amazing turnaround!} 48. Rxa6# {}
