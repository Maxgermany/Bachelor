1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 cxb2 5. Bxb2 {Woo hoo he accepted the whole thing!} d6 6. Qd5 {? Probably not very good, but I was trying to put pressure on him and it was blitz. But this was bad as it allowed him to develop with tempo.} Be6 7. Qb5+ {? I don't think this is great.} Nc6 {? Tempting to develop, but I think Pc6 would be better.} 8. Nf3 Be7 9. Nbd2 Nf6 10. e5 {Trying to squeeze him a little.} dxe5 11. Bxe6 fxe6 {Look at his poor, isolated, doubled, e pawns, easy to pick off.} 12. Nxe5 O-O {? Loses a pawn...} 13. Nxc6 {! To this} bxc6 14. Qxc6 {His position is in tatters. While he is still up a pawn, he has *four* different pawn islands, and three isolated pawns. White, has two pawn islands and one isolated pawn. White is also more active.} Bb4 15. Rd1 Bxd2+ {? Here he played what I hoped he'd do.} 16. Rxd2 Qc8 17. Qf3 {I look for a way to pick off a pawn.} Qe8 {He's shuffling his pieces around the back row.} 18. O-O {Gets my other rook involved.} Qa4 19. Qe3 {Threatens e6 and also lays a little trap...} Qxa2 {?? Looks tempting doesn't it, a free pawn and defending your pawn at the same time sounds pretty good right?} 20. Bxf6 {!} Qa5 21. Qxe6+ {He does not have long to live.} Rf7 22. Rd7 {I pile up on the pinned rook.} Raf8 23. Be7 {! With this move, he resigns. Please comment and rate.}
