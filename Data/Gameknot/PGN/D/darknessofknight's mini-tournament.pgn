1. d4 {My standard.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bd2 b6 5. e3 Bb7 {All perfectly natural progressions up until this point. The Fianchettoing of the bishop caught me slightly off guard. Not too much though, I'd seen it before.} 6. Nf3 c5 7. Nb5 {My first agressive move, normally uncharacteristic for me. However I decided to attack early and threaten Nd6 .} Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 {?! I felt the knight was in more of a fighting position here. Probably also subconscious from queen pins in the past.} d5 {Threatening the c4 pawn while protecting d6 with the queen...} 9. Be2 a6 {...And the long fight for the queenside has begun...} 10. Nc3 cxd4 11. exd4 dxc4 12. O-O {?! Perhaps blundered here, I was willing to give up development for the pawn being fairly sure I could obtain the en prise c4 pawn. Ended up spending the majority of the rest of the game trying to get this back.} b5 13. a4 {Thickening the queenside plot. I was hoping for } Qb6 14. axb5 axb5 15. Rxa8 Bxa8 16. b3 cxb3 17.
