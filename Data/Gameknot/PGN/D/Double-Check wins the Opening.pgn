1. e4 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. d3 g6 {Sicilian Defense. Not really my favorite, but I played it for kicks.} 4. Be3 d6 5. Nf3 Bg7 {I spy a lonely little pawn on b2.} 6. Qc2 Nb4 7. Qd2 Qa5 {At this point I am thinking Nc2 ! is a double check that wins me a rook, or at least wins the exchange for the rook.} 8. Nc3 Bxc3 9. Qxc3 Nc2+ {White ruined my fun with Nc3. I expected him to play 9. Pxc3 to save his rook. I guess he wanted to pressure my rook in h8.} 10. Kd2 Qxc3+ 11. Kxc3 Nxa1 {That was a lot of work just to win the exchange.} 12. Be2 Nf6 {Can't save my knight, might as well develop - white's development is miles ahead of black's right now.} 13. Rxa1 O-O 14. e5 Nh5 {14. ... Pxe5?, 15. Bxc5 leaves white threatening two different pawns. Black cannot save them both.} 15. Ng5 dxe5 {Now black can take the pawn, since white's last knight move took the pressure off of e5. I would like to break up the center a little bit, see if I can find a way to upgrade my material advantage - black cannot win the game by just staying up by a bishop for rook exchange alone.} 16. Bxc5 Re8 {Save the pawn.} 17. h3 Nf4 {I was somewhat relieved that white didn't play Bxh5 at any time. While exchanging while black is ahead in material (knight for a rook) favors black, those doubled and isolated pawns on the H file would have been problematic.} 18. Bf3 h6 {Time to drive away that pesky knight. Maybe even steamroll enough pawns to drive the bishop off of F3 so my knight can eat eat the g2 pawn.} 19. Ne4 f5 20. Nd2 Rd8 {I've chased the knight almost all the way home, and at d2 he prevents his rook from defending the backward pawn at d3. Time to attack.} 21. Bd5+ e6 {A sneaky trick by white, blocking with check, but it avails him not.} 22. g3 exd5 {22. g3? was a dubious move - at best it allows black to exchange pieces while he enjoys a material lead (with the side bonus of weakening white's kingside pawns), but it also looks like black comes out a pawn ahead no matter how you slice it. } 23. gxf4 dxc4 {double-threatening white's backward and indefensible d3 pawn.} 24. Nxc4 exf4 {Now black has what he needs to win. Up by a pawn and the exchange, and with a crushing 4-2 pawn adavantage on the King-side. Time to liquidate a little and start looking for that promotion. Black must also keep an eye on white's passed (but isolated) d pawn.} 25. Ne5 g5 26. Rg1 b6 27. Be7 Re8 {27. Be7? loses more material for white. After black's move, if white plays 28. Bd6 Re6 and now both 29. Nc4 pb5 or 29 Bc7 Bb7 followed by 30 Rc8 wins material for black.} 28. Bf6 Re6 29. Bxg5 hxg5 {Not 29. ... Rxe5?? 30 Bxf4  loses black's rook to the discovered check.} 30. Rxg5+ Kh7 31. Rh5+ Rh6 {I considered 31. ... Kg7 hoping for 32 Rg5  Kh6! which leaves white with threated rook and knight and no way to save both. But I didn't really think he would fall for it, and the move I chose forces him to exchange rooks (otherwise he loses his pawn on h3).} 32. Rg5 Rxh3 {I didn't expect to get the pawn, but I'll take it, eliminating one of white's two passed pawns and extending black's material lead.} 33. Ng6 Rf3 34. Nf8+ Kh6 35. Rg6+ Kh5 {I'm not sure what white is up to. A rook and a knight cannot force checkmate on an open board. I had expected him to bring in his king by now while my rook and bishop are too far away to do me much good. It's interesting to note that we've played 35 moves and are transitioning into the endgame at this point, and black's bishop at c8 has not moved yet - I don't know if that's good or bad, since black has built a sizeable material lead by staying so busy pursuing multiple attacks that I  haven't required the help of that bishop yet.} 36. Rg2 Bb7 {Now I finally move that bishop, threatening white's knight but also threatening 37. ... Rxd3  followed by 38. ... Bxg2.} 37. Rh2+ Kg4 38. Ne6 Bd5 {It's a fork. Now black wins another pawn.} 39. Nc7 Rc8 {I didn't expect that move by white. Nd4 would have been much more annoying, and probably would have saved his pawn on a2. This move, however, allows me to exchange pieces and win the d3 pawn.} 40. Kd4 Rxc7 41. Kxd5 Rd7+ 42. Ke6 Rdxd3 {And now it's pretty much a lock. White has nothing.} 43. Kf6 Rfh3 44. Rg2+ Kf3 45. Rg7 Rh6+ {Setting up a couple different checkmates. I expect white to be reluctant to move co F7 and let me exchange rooks, and I don't expect e7 because I think he wants my a7 pawn badly enough to not block his line of attack. But he cannot play 46. Kxf5 because of Rd5  . Maybe his best move would be to chase my rook with 46 Kg5, in which case I was seriously considering trading 2 rooks for 1 with 46. ... Rd1, 47 Kxh6 Rh1  48. K moves Rb1 , 49 Kf6 Rxg7 50. Kxg7 Kxf2 and now black promotes his advanced pawn.} 46. Ke5 Rhd6 {White moved into a forced mate in 2 (really mate in 3, since white can play the useless Rg3  if he wants to stall one move).} 47. Kxf5 Rd3d5# {}
