1. e4 {So this is a game I faced the Morra Gambit, against which I had had very poor score in Blitz games. People don't play it too often here, since altough it is full of traps and zaps for black and gives him lot to think about, it is most probably a little unsound.} c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 {This is the Gambit. White gets a tempo, open lines and space advantage for the price of pawn.} dxc3 {Accepting the gambit is the most natural and critical reply.} 4. Nxc3 {Interesting position. Obviously White will get his attack, but somehow he must succeed in creating some sort of weaknesses in blacks camp.} Nc6 {Not very much alternative squares for this knight.} 5. Nf3 e6 {The white bishop will most probably place himself to c4, so black is trying to cover all possible targets. } 6. Bc4 {White has to get agressive to show he have something for the pawn.} a6 {Continuing the theme of restricting the bishop. ...b5, ...Na5 and ...Nxb3 is a possible plan, trading of a piece and creating weakness to white's camp, then face the storm and win in endgame.} 7. O-O {The good thing in Morra as white is that he can play pretty much natural developing and attacking moves, while blacks developement is made bit awkward as the d-pawn will probably have to stay on d7 for some time, Kings Knight is hard to place to f6 due the possibility of e5.  The good thing for black is... err... the pawn. Winning chances in endgame. White is the one having all the fun for now.} Nge7 {I decided to develop this knight to g6. Don't know if it's the best plan, but the logic is clear. Knight out of the way so the black bishop can be developed and king be tucked to safety.} 8. Qe2 {I'm not sure about this move in positional basis, as it's not clear yet where the queen belongs. I'd probably play 8.Be3 black has stepped out of the option of ...Ng4 and e-pawn is under no pressure.} Ng6 9. Be3 b5 {Black sees that there is no obviously good squares for the dark squared bishop, so he decides to trade of white's bishop, make room for the light squared bishop and double white's pawns, trying to later prove them as weaknesses. Later in the game we'll see that altough doubled, black has no queenside pawn majority, so the doubled pawns are maybe not so weak. This is probably what white expected when playing 8.Qe2, as the queens rook may be active on his original square after eventual hxg3.} 10. Bb3 Na5 {There's no way getting offa this train we're on now.} 11. Rfd1 {When in doubt what to do, place you're rook opposite of the enemy queen. It's bound to prove useful. Here the rook eyes the d pawn which might turn into a weakness.} Nxb3 12. axb3 {It is not clear yet if  blacks maneuver is helpful. A semi-open file shouldn't hurt white...} Bb7 {The obvious square. Black queen would like to be on e7, but there is the problem with th dark squared bishop, who has no obvious squares.} 13. Bd4 {Making blacks developement even more awkward. Black decides to defend by covering some dark squares with pawns, as light squares are hardly becoming weaknesses.} f6 {Probably not a bad move. The e-pawn can go to e5, as light squared bishop controls d5.} 14. Qe3 {Threatening Bb6. Now dark squared bishop must move to avoid being locked up by the black queen.} Bb4 {There is no better square, as e7 is for queen and on d6 the bishop would be somewhat vulnerable. On Bb4 the bishop has no function, but is at least out of the way for castle.} 15. Nd2 {The knight has no future on f3. Though it is not clear what road should it take, there might have been a better move. Rc1 is at least natural.} e5 {Preventing f4. Black tries the best he can to keep the position as closed as possible.} 16. Bb6 Qe7 17. Rac1 Nf4 {Centralization. Black threatens to remove weaknesses by e5, maybe after castling.} 18. g3 Ne6 {Nice maneuver in blacks point of view. e6 is better square for knight that g6, with possible home of d4.} 19. Nd5 {More or less forcing the trade and thus driving blacks knight away from e6. The problem is that the knight will be very fine after g5-f7-d6. Second problem is that after the trade it is hard to attack the d-pawn.} Bxd5 20. exd5 Ng5 21. h4 {White wishes to gain acces to newly vacated e4-square.} Nf7 22. Ne4 Nd6 {Challencing the knight right away.} 23. Bc5 {Not sure about this move. After too many trades white runs out of steam.} Bxc5 {Black is quite happy to get rid of the ever problematic bishop.} 24. Nxc5 {White has the better knight, but now the lines for rooks are both blocked. I think black has passed the worst already.} O-O 25. Rc2 {Intending to double on c-file. Propably overlooking blacks duracel-knight who has made half of blacks moves already.} Nf5 26. Qf3 {This is a mistake, walking into a fork. But then again, on d5 the knight would be unchallenged and wonderful, eyeing the weakness of f3, e2 and c3 and preventing some rook activity. It's hard to avoid dropping the exchange, for example 26.Qc1 Nd5 27.Rd2 (Rc3 Ne2 ) Nf3  and rook drops. 26.Qd2 Nd5 27.Rc3 b4 and rook cannot cover c5 and f3, so white loses a piece.} Nd4 27. Rxd4 {Relatively best.} exd4 28. b4 {Defending knight. c5 is pretty good post here.} Rac8 {Qe1  followed by Qxb4 is interesting, but I did not want to give white any play at all. } 29. Re2 Qd6 30. Qf5 {Not sure what this accomplishes.} Rfe8 31. Rd2 Re5 {! Forcing queen trade. Endgame should be winning for black.} 32. Qxd7 {Otherwise black just wins another pawn.} Qxd7 33. Nxd7 Rxd5 34. Nc5 {Now black needs to find yet again a plan to penetrate. I admit that at this point I didn't give this game too much attention, thinking it to be winning and not bother to find the best plan and just plan and then move when I have to... Very unhealthy approach.} a5 {Just advancing, making eventual penetration more dangerous.} 35. Nd3 {The best.} a4 {Locking the queenside with the idea that if the b-pawn falls, then the whole position falls.} 36. Nc5 {Knight takes his rightful post back. } Kf7 37. Kg2 f5 38. f4 Re8 {There were nothing in the c-file I guess.} 39. Kf2 {White cannot prevent penetration.} Re3 40. Rxd4 {This was whites idea, but while it works tactically, it fails positionally. White should have tried to show that the rook does nothing on e3 and try to drive it aways from there or prevent Kg6-h5-g4.} Rxd4 41. Kxe3 Rxb4 42. Nd3 {Now, for having been on defence more or less the whole game, black now want's to have his time for fun.} Rxb2 {Remember what I said about the b-pawn? Knight are very poor in stopping rook's pawns.} 43. Nxb2 a3 {And the pawn queens. The knight is useless. The funny thing is that if black queen were 'in the box', say, at d3, the knight would be worse than useless, taking b2 away from the king, losing.} 44. Kd2 a2 {axb2 is of course winning king-and-pawn ending, but why not to queen if one can?}
