1. e4 c5 {Keeping faith with my beloved Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 {and planning my usual Najdorf} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. f3 {an unexpected response as 5. Nc3 is almost invariably played here.  This prepares a sort of English Attack (Be3) with a Maroczy Bind.  The pawn on f3 allows White to develop his B to e3 without being attacked by Black's KN.  It also sets up a strong central pawn chain.  Finally, because White hasn't yet played Nc3, he has the option of advancing his c-pawn (the Maroczy Bind).} e6 {I respond cautiously, with a standard Sicilian developing move, while delaying the characteristic Najdorf move ...a6 till it's needed.  It may not be necessary against White's formation, so I hold it back till I know.  I'm already out of my book learning, though I'm sure this game doesn't leave "The Book" for a long while yet.} 6. c4 {This has the advantage of controlling d5 but it does shut in White's wsb} Be7 7. Nc3 {now I feel the need for ...a6 so that I can play ...Qc7 and develop my queenside normally} a6 8. Be2 {Having established his pawn structure, White calmly completes his development before launching operations.  The direction of those operations will depend on where Black exposes weaknesses in his defences.  For example, White could develop his B to e3 and Q to d2, castle queenside and launch the g-pawn at a castled king (the English Attack), or alternatively, White may castle kingside and exploit the hole at b6 with Be3 and Na4.  The pawn on c4 encourages this approach.} Qc7 {If White launches the English Attack, I don't necessarily want to castle kingside.  This Q move prepares potential queenside castling but also supports ...Nc6 so that if White swaps Ns on c6, Black doesn't have to give himself an isolated pawn on a6 (something which jstevens1 of this parish has exploited against me in the past)} 9. O-O {Now I was fairly convinced that White would attack the queenside, so ...} O-O 10. Kh1 {Prophylactic: immediately avoiding any complications involving Black's B or Q on the g1-a7 diagonal.} Nc6 11. Be3 {as prepared on move 5.  Now I decided that the best place to develop my QB would be e6, as ...b5 was out of the question, so I decided to swap off a knight and make his B dance a little in the process.} Nxd4 12. Bxd4 e5 {always a move that requires careful forethought because of the hole it leaves at d5.  I think it was justified in this game.} 13. Be3 {?  13. Bf2 was better.  As pointed out by my opponent after the game , this was a "slight inaccuracy" which I could have exploited with a family fork on e3.  I didn't spot it at the time: can you?} Be6 14. Na4 {after a very long think, White launches the attack I'd anticipated, as discussed at move 8.} Nd7 {I resist the temptation to take on c4, fearing a pin on the c-file, opting instead to shadow White's N with my own, keeping him out of b6 and also giving myself the option of attacking e4 with ...f5 at some point} 15. Rc1 Nc5 {blocking the c-pawn's advance and attacking White's N but this move also has a serious disadvantage, as I only noticed after White's reply.} 16. Nc3 {Now White can occupy d5 at will as I cannot defend it with another minor piece.  My N is two moves away from defending it.  I felt a serious sinking feeling at this point, feeling that I was being out-manoeuvred by my hard-thinking opponent.} Rac8 {After a long think on my part, I decide to accept my fate and further reinforce the defence of c5 with my R.  We're both now fully developed, though our f-Rooks could be improved.} 17. b4 Nd7 18. Na4 {White doesn't give up on his attack on c5 and b6!  (But he does give up his option of occupying d5, since now my N has time to cover back.)  Once more the c-pawn appears to be on offer (2 defenders, 3 attackers) but my Q and R are the wrong way round.  More importantly, White is preparing to advance it again.  If it moves to c5 next move, White has  four pieces to defend it and Black has 5 to attack it, but, again, the Q and R are the wrong way round, so ...} b6 {providing extra cover to c5 but as my opponent starts to think again, my heart sinks again as I realise I've left the a-pawn dangling.  White may be able to play c5 after all!} 19. Qe1 {This took me by surprise as I hadn't considered it at all.  So what was its purpose?  It defends b4 and clears d1 for a R.  It also looks at f2 to support the B's attack on b6 and g3 to start a quick strike at the K with Bh6 to follow or, more subtly, f3-f4-f5, or, if Black takes on f4, B/Qxf4 with multiple possibilities that I hadn't even thought about for several moves while I'd been concentrating on the queenside.  Another long (for me) think ensued ...} f5 {Counter-attack in the centre!  If White doesn't take, I play ...f4, blocking his B off from my kingside and preventing Qg3.  If White does take, I increase the potential of my d-pawn to convert from 6-stone weakling into a Charles Atlas of the chessboard, muscling its way past White's c-pawn and on to the sunny beach on the eighth rank...  I didn't quite believe in this move at the time.  Let's see if it works ...} 20. exf5 Bxf5 {Amazingly, neither player now has a piece covering d5, that gaping hole in my position!} 21. Qf2 {Attacking b6 and supporting an advance to c5, which no longer bothers me as I plan to skip past it.} Rcb8 22. Rfd1 {temporarily foiling my plan while posting the R on a more active square} Be6 {restoring the possibility of ...d5 while preserving the possibility of ...e4, since White's f-pawn is pinned against his Q} 23. c5 bxc5 24. bxc5 d5 {et voila!} 25. c6 {a thorn in my side alright but it's going nowhere immediately} Nf6 26. Bc5 {hmm.. the pawn made way for this move, which looks dangerous} Bxc5 27. Nxc5 Bc8 {As the B is attacked by White's N and I want to preserve it, I move it to c8 so that if White takes my a-pawn with his N I can nullify the fork by taking it.  If White takes with his B, I calmly capture on c6, preserving material parity.  I no longer need the B on e6 or f7 because the Nf6 defends d5.} 28. Bxa6 Qxc6 {White doesn't seem to have any useful N moves to exploit the discovered attack on my Q} 29. Qe2 {attacking e5 and defending a6} Re8 {defending e5} 30. a4 {Now White launches his remote passed pawn.  Which will prove stronger - his a-pawn or my d-pawn?} Qd6 {The pawns need muscle behind them and I was no longer comfortable only having his N between my Q and his R.  Now I can threaten his Ba6 and look to halt his a-pawn.} 31. Bxc8 Rbxc8 32. Ne4 {exploiting the pin on my d-pawn but opening up another possibility.} Nxe4 33. fxe4 d4 {with White's pawn on e4, I don't have to worry about the defence of e5, so my pieces are freed for action.} 34. Qa2+ {The check gains time to support the advance of the a-pawn.} Kh8 {Here I had to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of hiding the K behind the pawns (safety from frontal attack and vulnerability to back-rank mates) against centralising (vulnerability to frontal and lateral attack but increased mobility and potential support for my central pawns).  Hiding seemed most prudent at this point, with the Qs still on board and my back rank well defended.} 35. Qd5 {and now Ion's training came into play.  I had this voice running through my head: when defending, avoid swapping off pieces.  The other mantra was that it's better to attack than defend and that attack is the best form of defence, so...} Qf6 {He who runs away lives to fight another day ...} 36. Qd7 {Two attackers on my c8 rook but again I avoid the temptation to swap off} Rcd8 {and counter-attack!} 37. Qc6 Qf4 {Oh no you don't!  My Q takes up a more aggressive posture.  For the first time in the game, I'm attacking as much as I'm defending.  White can't force me to swap Queens and his Q is tied to the defence of his e-pawn.  He is now getting seriously short of time as well.  He probably had about 10 minutes left at this point, while I had about half an hour or 40 minutes.} 38. Rdf1 Qe3 {Now I'm nearly ready to shepherd my d-pawn home.} 39. Rf3 Qe2 40. Rcf1 {threatening 41. Qxe8  Rxe8 42. Rf8  Rxf8 43. Rxf8  } Reg8 {Now White's actions on my back rank aren't checks, so less forcing.  The new mantra going through my head became "Whatever you do, don't move the g8 rook", which led me to miss an opportunity.} 41. Qc7 {attacking Rook and e-pawn (see the earlier sequence - I can't recapture on d8)} Rde8 {sidestepping the attack and defending e5} 42. Qf7 {renewing the threat} Rea8 {Preparing to block the a-pawn, though I can't take it because of Qxg8  followed by Rf8  } 43. a5 {White exploits that point immediately.} d3 {and I counter with my own pawn advance!} 44. Qc4 {White rushes back, pinning the pawn against my Q.  The a-pawn is still defended by the same trick.} Rad8 {I defend the d-pawn against the double attack and prepare to support it to its destination.} 45. a6 {White's pawn creeps inexorably closer ...} Qc2 {Now I'm ready to swap off in the interest of the pawn's lust to expand} 46. Qxc2 dxc2 47. Rc3 Rd1 {White can't take the pawn because of ...Rxf1    but can't take the R because of cxd1=Q/R   } 48. Kg1 {? 48. Rg1 was better} Rd2 {?? missing the golden opportunity while the Rf1 was pinned.  48...Rf8!! would have won but I didn't even consider it because of the aforementioned mantra.  Freddy would condemn my hidebound thinking!} 49. a7 h6 {finally creating air for my K} 50. Rf2 Rd1+ 51. Rf1 Rf8 {Now I'd created air for my K, I saw the pin but the chance was gone.  This move no longer wins because White's pawn has reached a7} 52. Rcf3 Rxf3 53. a8=Q+ Kh7 54. gxf3 Rxf1+ 55. Kxf1 c1=Q+ {Now I try desperately to engineer a situation whereby I might be able to fork his K and Q in favourable circumstances or even skewer them but basically I'm thinking it's a draw now unless I blow it or win on time.  White now had less than 3 minutes and I had about 20 but I couldn't make them count.} 56. Kf2 Qd2+ 57. Kg3 Qf4+ 58. Kg2 Qg5+ 59. Kf2 h5 60. Qc8 {White looks to set up a perpetual on the c8-h3 diagonal} h4 61. Qg4 Kg6 {I thought if White swapped Qs now I might be able to get zugzwang and win but that was a delusion.  However, if I avoided swapping, White would probably get a perpetual anyway... Could I keep him thinking long enough while winning was still possible "by normal means"?} 62. Kg2 Qxg4+ 63. fxg4 Kg5 64. Kf3 g6 65. h3 Kf6 66. Ke3 {Now the position looks dead drawn, so with the match already lost, I offered the draw.  He had one minute left, I had 13.  I was exhausted and elated at preventing the whitewash (apart from the defaulted bottom board), then slightly disappointed at having missed the win but overall a game that ran the gamut of chess emotion and thoroughly enjoyed.   I hope you've enjoyed it too.}
