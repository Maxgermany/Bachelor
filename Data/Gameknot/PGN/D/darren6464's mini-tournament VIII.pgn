1. e4 {I created this game notation at the request of j101m to review the game we played.  Welcome comments from anyone as we try to improve our chess together.} e5 2. f4 f5 {Interesting response for a King's Gambit.  I'd never seen this one before so decided to have a little fun.  This move opens up the king to potential check down the road, depending upon moves made.  By making this move Black is exposing his King in order for faster development.} 3. exf5 exf4 {Now my pawn on the f file is poised to support my Queen assault Black's King.} 4. Qh5+ g6 {Instead of g6, another playable move is 4. ... Ke7} 5. fxg6 {Now Black has some potentially ugly choices to make.  The game is far from lost, but White is in the driver's seat.} Nf6 {Not a bad move.  I actually like Qe7+ better.  It allows Black to get the Queen into the game with a tempo move and opens up more possibilities down the road.} 6. g7+ {I don't know if Black expected this move as a response, but sacrificing a Queen (momentarily) in total allows me to trade a pawn for a Rook, all while getting a new Queen.} Nxh5 7. gxh8=Q {Now I am up 5 pts and have a Queen in Black's backfield.  Black needs to attack early and often to make up the difference.} Qh4+ {This line of attack seeks parity by offering the same trick that White used against Black.  If White parries with g3, the same situation will arise that just played out a few moves ago.  I still like Qe7+ better here.  If White isn't careful, that move can work towards trapping White's Queen.} 8. Kd1 {Discretion being the counterpoint to valor, White flees.} d5 {I categorize this move as a blunder.  Far better to do d6.  It's a good idea to get the LSB into the game on g4 to provide some much needed pressure to White's exposed King, but by moving to d5, Black allows White's Queen to get back into the game.  If d6 instead, then the next move for Black would be Nf3.  Although that threatens Black's Queen, it doesn't allow White to get their Queen back into the game for free plus giving up a pawn.} 9. Qe5+ Kd8 {It's possible Kf7 is better, to allow Black's Rook easier egress.} 10. Qxd5+ Bd6 11. Nf3 Qe7 {I would have considered Bg4 first.  That way you would have had the added benefit of protecting the Knight on h5} 12. Qxh5 Nc6 13. Bb5 Bd7 {Blocking here is the only feasible choice.  If you move the knight out of the way, to a5 perhaps, Re1 is just a crushing play.} 14. Re1 Qg7 {When you're down big, trade pawns, not pieces.  Down 9 Black is in a big-time hole.  This move allows White to force a Queen trade.} 15. Qg5+ Qxg5 16. Nxg5 a6 17. Bxc6 Bxc6 18. Nf7+ {Allowing a trade... All White has to do to win is trade pieces on even terms.} Kd7 19. Nxd6 cxd6 {I might have considered capturing with the King.  While a comeback is unlikely, keep your pawns together if you can.} 20. d3 Bxg2 21. Bxf4 Bf3+ 22. Kd2 Rf8 23. Bg3 h5 24. Nc3 Rg8 25. Re3 Bg2 26. Rae1 Rg4 27. Ne4 h4 {not a bad plan, if only for that pesky Knight...} 28. Nf6+ {}
