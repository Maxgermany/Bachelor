[White "Carlos_b (1817)"]
[Black "Abinadi1 (1543)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Byrne (English) attack"]

1. e4 c5 {Apparently 1.e4 results in the most wins for white, but the Sicilian Defence result in most games being won by black. For black it asserts control over the d4-square and begins the fight for the centre of the board.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Most common response by white to the Sicillian is to exchange pawns. This allows for fast development by white but at a cost of losing one of his centre pawns. For black the exchange opens the c file which unbeknown to me at this point, was critical to the rsult of this game.    } cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Here we have blacks most common variation to the sicilian denfence - the Najdorf. Essentially delaying the e5 push for the benefit of avoiding the check on b5 by whites bishop, prevents whites knights from using the b5-square, and helps Black create queenside play by preparing the ...b5 pawn push.} 6. Be3 {White responds with the English Attack 6.Be3 aimed at pushing the kingside pawns and eventaully castling queen side } e5 {Now safe to push to e5 thus forcing the knight away from the centre} 7. Nb3 Be6 8. Be2 Be7 {That E file is stacked! Freeing up the back line for castling, white prepares for a major kingside pawn assault } 9. f3 Nbd7 10. g4 Nb6 {Nb6? A dubious move on my behalf. Originally 9.Nbd7 was aimed at backing up my knight on f6 but then Nb6 was aimed ...Bc4, offering a bishop exchange and hoping for my knight on c4 thus forking white bishop and b pawn thus breaking up that phalanx of pawns. Better may have been ...b5 or ...Rc8.  } 11. h4 Bc4 {Bc4?? implement my orignial plan } 12. Bxb6 {And there goes that idea and what results in my being a piece down and a vulnerable queen } Qxb6 {Virtually forced} 13. Bxc4 Qb4 {Threatening c4 } 14. Bd3 d5 {Hoping for a pawn exchange to place my knight on d5 taking advantage of whits pinned knight on c3} 15. a3 {Simple as that, another of my desperate attempts to equalise on peices is thwarted} Qd6 {Only safe square really with those knights covering alot of the queenside} 16. g5 d4 {d4!? I figured whites knights were more valuable to him than mine was. Another dubious move by me. Another benefit I thought of was placing my rook on the soon to be open g file, but also ruins my castling opportunities. } 17. gxf6 gxf6 {-5 down and white can simply move the knight to the safe and powerful d5 square. Things are beginning to get worse for me.} 18. Nd5 Rg8 {I had to claim the g file or else I was really stuffed by allowing white to claim it.} 19. Qe2 Bd8 20. O-O-O {My novice opinion on castling. At my current level of understanding and what Ive experienced within my games over the years - nearly every time I castle I lose. I find it just give my opponent a fixed target and unless crucial can result in loss of tempo. I understand the benefits it provides in getting the king safe behind the pawns and activates the rooks but as you will see in this game, once the pawn structure is destroyed, the king is very vulnerable and stuck in a corner. My experience is leave the king in the centre, wait for your opponent to castle then attack that side with your pawns. Opinions and advice on castling is welcomed. } f5 {Desperate attempt to lure the pawn of the e file and then take the knight its protecting} 21. Nb4 f4 {I wanted to slow any further pawn attack on my centre pawns, thus locking it up was my best option as the pawn exchange was declined} 22. h5 {h5? thoughts anyone? Im not sure what whites intentions were other than preventing the advancement of my pawn abd eventually prevent the escape of my king through the open g file if occasion required later in the game} Rc8 {Looking at the board, Im down pieces and my position is weak, but I see a slim chance of taking advantage of the pinned c file pawn, positioning my queen and claiming that knight on b3. By the way, those a & b file pawns of mine are doing a superb job at haulting queenside attack so this is the only really way of activating my rook, getting them onto open or soon to be open files. } 23. Rh3 {Rh3? once again, not sure what white is thinking} Qe6 {surely white will see whats coming, he's seen everything else I thrown at him!} 24. Rdh1 {Doubing up rooks on the h file? someone want to tell me what he may be planning on doing?} Qxb3 {Yes! a small win} 25. Kb1 {releasing the pin so I have to get out of there now} Qa4 26. h6 {?? as stated previously, preventing the escpae of my king and hoping for an eventually back line mate?} Rc3 {Rc3!? Despearate times call for Desperate Measures! My opinion on castling still stands - once the pawn structure is broken the king is in a corner and potentially in trouble. This game is about capturing the king, not how many pieces you can take...Surely my rook Gambit is an offer too good to refuse } 27. bxc3 {-7, very much down on pieces, but positionally, very threatening. Now to try and capitalise on his exposed king} dxc3 28. Ka2 {Preventing the further loss of his kingside pawns.} Be7 {capitalising on his pinned pawn} 29. Rb1 {Protecting the knight} Rg1 {Rg1! if 30. Rxg1 Bxb4 and threatening an eventualy mate on b2 } 30. Rb3 {Best option. Protecting the knight, pawn and threatening my pawn on c3, but my rook on the 1st rank is now dangerous if 30...Bxb4 31.Rxb4 Ra1+! 32. Kxa1 Qxa3+ 33. Kb1 Qxb4+ 34.Kc1 Qb2+ 35.Kd1 Qb1++.} Bxb4 31. Rh5 {Futile effort to check my king and hope to take back the tempo} f6 {easily blocked} 32. Qf1 {From a desperate rook gambit, the tables have turned. The exchange of the rook on the a file is whites only hope, but a great cost to white} Rxf1 {The game continues 33.Bxf1 Bxa3 34.Rxb7 Bb4+ and white resigns due to multiple mate options from black that white simply is unable to prevent. So what I have learnt from this game - if the game is essentially lost, sometimes its worth desperate measures just at that chance that your opponent miscalculates and you turn the game around. Im not convinced that Castling is the best option as demonstrated, it was the castling that gave me essentially an extra move that was crucial to my plan. And once the pawns structure is broken sometimes are risky, costly moves, it can result in an exposed and heavily threatened king. Comments most welcome   }
