[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann, normally a very solid defence favoured by, among others, Anatoly Karpov.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The Advance Variation, as recommended by Greek Grandmaster Kotronias in his book "Beating the Caro Kann".  It's a long time since I read this book but I loved its devil take the hindmost attitude.} Bf5 {Black develops his QB outside the pawn wall, establishing an annoying attack on c2.} 4. Nc3 {Kotronias's preferred choice.  I've seen Short get good results with 4. Nf3 and indeed Board 5 ended peacefully with this variation.} e6 5. g4 {White immediately harasses the annoying Bishop, having secured e4 against a counter-attack on h1.} Bg6 6. Nge2 {This N is heading for g3 in accordance with what I remember of Kotronias's recipe.  It temporarily blocks in White's KB but that prelate has nowhere useful to go yet anyway.} Bb4 {Black pins White's N, allowing the QB to dream of landing on e4 again.} 7. Ng3 {So I abandon my general rule of thumb in this opening of making alternate moves with pieces and pawns by immediately moving my KN a second time to cover e4.} Nd7 {Black continues to develop solidly, putting pressure on White's pawn centre.  I was expecting ...c5 soon.} 8. h4 {Now White sends another footsoldier after the annoying bishop, heedless of the holes he's creating in his kingside.} f6 {?! Normal is 8...h6, allowing the B to stay on the b1-h7 diagonal.  This move had the advantage of making me think and continued Black's attack on e5 but it didn't really work for Black.} 9. f4 {Torn between 9. h5 and this, I eventually decided to defend the e-pawn, hoping also for a possible fork on e6 - rather too hopeful, really.  An immediate 9. h5 would have had the advantage of forcing the B back immediately.  Delaying it gives Black time to play ...h6 if he wants.  I normally play f4 at some stage soon in this opening anyway, so I wasn't too concerned about clearing my second rank of kingside pawns.  White hopes to pressurise Black into trouble with the pawn storm, though, with sound defence, it isn't that frightening really.} fxe5 10. fxe5 {Preferable to dxe5 because that would release Black's d-pawn for a devastating central attack as I often suffer in the French Winawer.  Now who is going to be able to exploit the open f-file first?} Bxc3+ {Black creates a pawn weakness on White's queenside, so now castling either side looks unattractive.  Black, however, can castle safely on the queenside.} 11. bxc3 Qa5 12. Bd2 {I normally play this B to e3 to discourage ...c5 but in this position preparing a discovered attack on Black's Q seems preferable.} O-O-O {I think Black has every right to feel pleased with his position here.  He just needs to complete his development and proceed to exploit White's over-stretched pawns.} 13. h5 {Finally White gets his planned pawn push in, forcing the B off his diagonal.} Bf7 14. Bh3 {?!  I was aggressively looking to advance the g-pawn again and attack Black's weak pawn on e6 but I think a central posting on d3 might have been better.} Ne7 15. O-O {!? Startling castling!  ... somewhat rash?  But Black's Q is far from the action now and White's advanced pawns are hemming Black's minor pieces in.  My immediate plan was to attack Black's B on f7 with as much heavy artillery as I could muster.} Rdf8 16. Rf3 {! I like this move because it prepares trebling on the f-file while also defending c3, allowing the QB to move, and also potentially allowing the rook to swing across the queenside to double on the b-file, attacking Black's castled position.  One move I also wanted to play at some stage soon was Bg5.  I can do this now that the R defends c3 and g3; otherwise Black's Q would wreak havoc olong my third rank.} g6 {??  This loses either the exchange or a whole piece.} 17. Bh6 {!  Black was a picture of despair but he brushed himself off and determined to make a fight of it.  He played solidly from here on.} Qd8 {An unexpected bonus.  I no longer had to worry about c3.} 18. Bxf8 {I capitalised immediately.  No sense in looking a gift horse in the mouth.} Rxf8 19. Qf1 Qe8 20. Qf2 Ng8 {Heading for h6, whence he can defend the B again and also threaten g4 or f5 if White gets careless.} 21. Rf1 {The battery is complete, though not in the optimum configuration with Q at the back.  I couldn't prevent ...Nh6 with g5 because my h-pawn was vulnerable.  Setting up the battery immediately pinned Black's B on f7.} Nh6 22. hxg6 hxg6 23. Ne2 {The start of a long knight manoeuvre that nearly cost me the game.  At this stage, the aim was simply to attack g6 from f4.} Rh8 {! Black seizes the h-file, making it too risky for White to take on f7, leaving the Bh3 dangling.} 24. Nf4 {Now the threat to g6 is no longer really a threat but next move I went into a long think and came up with a bad plan that I thought would be picturesque and winning} Rh7 {?!  After the game, Nathan thought that he should have aimed to get the Q in front of the R, with stronger mating potential.} 25. Nd3 {? Now I couldn't see any way of prosecuting my attack on the kingside and thought that Black was sufficiently tied up over there that he couldn't really threaten anything, so I decided on a knight march to d6.  This gave Black time to generate real threats against my King and I never achieved it anyway!} Qh8 26. Qg2 b6 {Played to prevent Nc5 but, as it happened, I had other plans.} 27. Nb2 {?  It wasn't too late to back out of my plan but I was seduced by its arrogant elegance!} g5 28. c4 Bg6 {!  Threatening ...Be4, which I only just noticed after I played the next move, I'm ashamed to say.} 29. cxd5 {?! dubous in view of 29. ... Be4!} cxd5 {?! dubious for the same reason!  Now 30...Be4 will be less powerful because White has 31. Rc3+} 30. Ra3 {But White avoids the skewer with this gesture against Black's queenside.  I thought the check from c3 offered nothing whereas this move threatened the a-pawn and then check from a8, skewering K against Q.} Be4 {! Now the full import of this move hit me: White's Q moves, Black's N moves, White's B moves and mayhem ensues from h1!} 31. Qe2 {! Looks cool!  White continues to develop his counter-attack but I was beginning to have serious worries now that I'd blown it.} Nxg4 {! Of course 32. Bxg4 allows 32... Rh1+ followed by a skewer of K & Q: a tasty barbecue.  If I just retreat with 32. Bg2, 32...Bxg2 followed by ...Rh2 and ...Rh1 mate.  32. Qxg4 doesn't really help: 32....Rxh3 followed by threats of Rh1+ and Q down the h-file as well or Qf8+ as takes Black's fancy.} 32. Rxa7 {!? Pursuing my attack at the expense of my Bh3.  If the attack fails, Black wins.} Rxh3 {!? threatens mate in 1.  Now White has no convincing defence, so must pursue mate at any cost himself.} 33. Ra8+ {!} Nb8 {!?  Nathan seemed to think this was OK but I thought it a mistake, as I couldn't see a forced win after 33...Kc7 and taking Black's Q would do me no good.  In cold light of day, I see that I could afford to take the Q as doing so would have defended h1, so maybe 33. Nb8 was OK.} 34. Qa6+ {!? single-minded pursuit of Black's King.  I'm not convinced my attack was completely sound though.  The alternative was 34. Qxg4, when Black gains the initiative, probably leading to mate or serious material gain.} Kc7 35. Rf7+ {!} Nd7 {? Loses immediately.  35...Kc6 36. Qb7+ (or 36. Qa4+ b5) 37. Kb5 37. a4+ Kb4 38. Qxb6+ Kc3 offers Black some hope and definitely lasts longer.} 36. Qa7+ {! with mate to follow: 36...Kc6 37. Qxd7#  A spectator pointed out that 36. Rxd7+ Kxd7 37. Qb7# would have been prettier.  This win gave us a 4-2 victory in the match: much needed points!}
