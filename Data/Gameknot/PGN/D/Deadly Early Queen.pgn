1. e4 {I joined Pauli0072's game. I checked out a few of his games quickly before.  I saw that he exposes the queen early so maybe there's a chance there.} d5 {I saw he used queen pawn open alot.} 2. exd5 {One for me!} Qxd5 {Wow queen's out fourth move!  So much for development.} 3. Nc3 Qf5 4. Bd3 Qg5 5. Nf3 {Going to get me a queen!} Qxg2 {Yikes! an uninvited guest.} 6. Rg1 Qh3 7. Bf1 Qe6+ 8. Be2 {Whew.  Now time for a bit of development.} Nc6 9. d3 h6 10. d4 Nb4 11. Kf1 {Should have gone with Pxa2 to deal with the Knight at b4} Qh3+ {Round 2! We're under attack.} 12. Rg2 Bf5 {That bishop is trouble with the Knight at b4 I should have moved the Rook in anticipation of Kxc2} 13. Ng1 {But my mind was on this Ah ha!  I've got the queen trapped he's got no where to go. } Qh4 {(sigh) except for h4!! } 14. a3 Nxc2 {Ugg why didn't I see this one Bf5 covers Kxc2. Can't take him with the Queen} 15. Rb1 {Saved the Rook.} Nxd4 {Now the Rook is exposed to the Bishop at F5 I should have moved it but...} 16. Nf3 {Shall I take your Knight or the Queen?} Nxf3 {Niether! I goofed here and recapture his knight leaving the Rook exposed.} 17. Bxf3 {Which he takes full advantage of...} Bxb1 {Ow!!!} 18. Nxb1 {Well got a consolation bishop not very satisfying though} Rd8 19. Qb3 Nf6 20. Qb5+ {Now it's my turn! Take that!} c6 {My next move proves to be fatal instead of Qxb7, Qxc5 might have been the play.} 21. Qxb7 {Visions of checking with Qxc6 were going through my head until....} Qc4+ {What the?... ah excuse me Paul, I was checking you.  } 22. Ke1 Qxc1+ {Ugg dead Bishop and check!} 23. Ke2 {Knight is vunerable.} Qc2+ 24. Nd2 {"Fear not O King, for this mighty Knight will save you!"} Qxd2+ {um or not.  Yeesh!} 25. Kf1 {Ah I don't suppose I could get a free move here?  I didn't think so... : (} Qc1+ 26. Ke2 Rd2+ {I got troubles!} 27. Ke3 Rxb2+ 28. Kd3 Rxb7 {Oh the unmitigated pain! I have to conceed here, stick a fork in my attack plan it's done!   }
