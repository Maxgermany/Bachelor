1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3 Bd6 5. Ne5 {Typical London asset. } O-O {Black accepts. } 6. g4 {The older and sharpest plan: as a well experienced player must know, this is somewhat premature, and black can meet it. Nevertheless, it's always a good way to make your opponent think. } Nc6 7. g5 {I want my Q out, so I have to kick the N. } Ne4 {Very nice, but almost useless. } 8. Qg4 {What's this Q doing up here? } f6 {Ok, now it starts. NxNc6 etc is not good because of BxBf4, disrupting white's pawns. } 9. gxf6 {A semiopen column is created, but at the cost of a weak f2!} Qxf6 10. Rg1 {I couldn't calculate, so I just played by feeling. I must make the most of my threats, I don't have time for Nd2. As an emergency savior, I had Bg3, but I prefer not to play it (e.g. NxBg3, hxg3? Qxf2+. As long as e3 is defended and the R defends Bf1, I can even let black play it!)} Nxe5 {The counterside of letting the B there. } 11. dxe5 Bxe5 12. c3 {Just holding. If d4, I'm lost, but I had in mind ideas like Bh6 (QxB, QxN). The "little problem" was Qxf2+, Kd1, Bxc3+ and so on.} Bxf4 {Ok, the B is forced away and now the pressure against g2(Edit:g7) is strong. } 13. exf4 {Black can't take the pawn or Qxg2# (cashing the tempo spent on Rg1). Still...} e5 {In those situations, in blitz, it is so easy to blunder... I played coldly...} 14. Qg2 {...giving the pawn, but better than lose the grip on g2(edit:g7).} exf4 15. Nd2 {I have to develop very quickly, not allowing black to create pressure on the e column. } Nxd2 {Not the best, as Re8 seemed more to the idea of attacking. Here, White missed Qxd5+, Be3, QxNd2. I can't say if it was better.  } 16. Kxd2 {I couldn't castle, but my R is mobile and my K can't be checked right now. } f3 {Ok, cool blood again. } 17. Qg3 {Let's see how he breaks in. } Qh6+ 18. Kc2 Bf5+ 19. Bd3 {By exchanging undeveloped pieces, my disadvantage can be somewhat reduced: Black must avoid to get into a siuation where the perpetual is his best option. Of course Kb3 allowed Qb6+ and must be avoided. } Rae8 {Correctly threatening Re2+.} 20. Bxf5 {No choice, or Re2+ and BxB. } Rxf5 {!? Better was to check at once with Re2+, this gives me a tempo. } 21. Rae1 {Giving up the pressure on g, but if B exchange, I will have Re8+ as a resource to mobilize my R. } Rff8 {Here I lost the chance to play RxR, RxR, Qxf3, winning a pawn. } 22. Qxc7 {...but I considered this instead. It keeps the pressure on g7, and prevents BQ to force the Q exchange with Qg6+. } Qf6 {First step to play g6 or something. Black's Kside is weak indeed. Rf7 can't be played (RxRe8+) and if RxRe1, RxR, black is still in the same trouble. } 23. Qxb7 {Not only to snatch a pawn, but to threat d5. Of course, all this pawn munching has the counterside of leaving wide open to the R's action the queenside my K is shielding behind. } Re2+ {I can play Kb3, actually, but...} 24. Rxe2 {This gives me a tempo to take d5 with check. } fxe2 25. Qxd5+ Kh8 {I just have to be careful with the e2 pawn, take it without losing mine, and I'm up! From a defending position to a half-won endgame!} 26. Qc5 {?? Poor move. It doesn't defend f2, and the attack on a7 is secondary. } Re8 {?? It seemed much more interesting for black the sequence Qxf2, QxQ, RxQf2,  Kd2 (or Re1), Rxh2, probably winning. } 27. Re1 Qg6+ 28. Kb3 {Kc1 was countered by Qd3.} Rb8+ 29. Kc4 {Black can't take on b2 because of the backrank mate Qc8#.} Qg4+ 30. Kd3 {The mate threat is now Qf8, if the R leaves. } Qf3+ {Ok, this can go on forever, but now I am the one who may win. Qe3 could have been interesting in sight of QxQ, fxQ, Rxb2, Rxe2.} 31. Kc2 Qe4+ 32. Kc1 Rd8 {Now is the white's king the troubled one. This is because of my will of not exchanging Q...} 33. Qe3 {Rd1+, RxR, exR=Q+, KxQ, Qb1+, Qc1, Qxa2 could have been an outcome. } Qa4 {Here, I blundered by playing Rxe2, and Qd1# followed. If instead I had played the correct Qxe2, actually I think white has the better of it!} 34. Qxe2 {What do you think? } h6 {}
