1. d4 {I started out thinking about an irregular move-set. The Queen's Gambit.} Nf6 {He began by developing his king-side knight.} 2. c4 {I continued my Gambit like moves and opened up my queen for development. } d5 {He placed his protected pawn on d5. This allowed me to know he wanted a fast paced game.} 3. cxd5 {I took him, offering a trade off.} Nxd5 {He completed the trade but minimized his teams development.} 4. e4 {I threatened his knight with my king's pawn} Nb6 {He moved away and both of us were still yet to develop.} 5. Nf3 {I began with a slight variation to a 3 knights defense.} h5 {He moved out to offer a different game set, in my opinion} 6. Nc3 {I stayed on the path to my three knights defense.} Bg4 {He pinned my knight and queen.} 7. h3 {I forced him to take action, livening up the pace.} Bxf3 {He took my knight off my hands for a trade.} 8. Qxf3 {I accepted the trade and developed my queen.} Qxd4 {He took my pawn, ruining my defense.} 9. Be3 {I threatened his queen, and pinned his knight.} Qf6 {The queen nicely backed off. Ready, at any moment, for a queen's trade.} 10. Nb5 {I setup for a fork between his king and rook.} Na6 {He further developed his pieces and the Queen's side of the board looked more like a stable.} 11. Bxb6 {I took his knight with no further threat.} Qxf3 {He Traded of the queens evenly, and I was ready for mate.} 12. gxf3 {I traded off. Devising my plan.} axb6 {He took my bishop and I decided to continue.} 13. Rd1 {A well placed rook stopped his king from motion. That should have a been a sure sign of foresighted mate.} c6 {He threatened my knight. I was planning on allowing him to take it so that I could mate him.} 14. a4 {I still protected though, not seeming suspicious.} cxb5 {He took no mercy and my sacrifice was a completion. At this point it wouldn't make a difference what I lost.} 15. Bxb5# {Mate. I killed his pawn for revenge and finished off the rest of that maniac. Good game CM. I hope to play again soon. Hope you enjoyed it Everybody. Thanks.}
