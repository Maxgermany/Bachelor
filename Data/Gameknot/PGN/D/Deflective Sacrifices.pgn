1. e4 {The King's Pawn Opening.} c5 {The, "cornerstone", of the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Bc4 {This is an attempted, "Scholars Mate", but I am used to it.} e6 {Therefore, I respond with this move.} 3. d3 {! He made this move to Fianchetto his DSB, but I am not going to allow it because he has attempted a dirty trick.} d5 {Therefore, I respond by playing a powerful fork between his LSB and e4 pawn.  According to Jack Stockel, this is the, "proper continuation", after you respond to an attempted, "Four Move Trick".  BTW, I am referring to 2.Bc4, e6, for those that do not understand.} 4. exd5 {He responds by capturing my d5, but I would respond with a nuisance check (4.Bb5+), if I were white.} exd5 {! However, I recapture his d5 pawn, and this is solid.  That is because everything is still even, and I am attacking his LSB.  } 5. Bb3 {Therefore, he retreats his LSB, but 5.Ba4+ or 5.Bb5+ would have been his best move, as I had mentioned earlier.  If 5.Ba4+ or 5.Bb5+, 5...Bd7, 6.Bxd7, 6...Nxd7, and everything is still, "level".} c4 {?? I chose this candidate to play another powerful fork between his LSB and d3 pawn.  However, this is not good because he will win a free pawn, so I will be a point behind.  It is usually not so bad, but this will become a problem.  In fact, it is worse then you might think.  } 6. dxc4 {That is because I cannot recapture with 6...dxc4, or he will force a queen exchange with 7.Qxd8+, Kxe8.  According to Mr. Stockel, a queen exchange will put you at a strategical advantage, as it will take away your chance to castle, in this situation. } Be6 {! I moved my LSB to protect my d5 pawn.  As I had mentioned earlier, 6...dxc4? due to the queen exchange.  Therefore, this was my best move.} 7. cxd5 {In response, he decides to capture my d5 pawn.} Bxd5 {?? Therefore, I recapture his LSB, but this was not a good choice.  That is because I just blundered my LSB, so I will be 4 points behind, instead of 1 when 8.Bxd5 is played.  In addition, I will not be able to respond with 8...Qxd5, or I will loose my queen because he will respond with 9.Qxd5.} 8. Bxd5 Nf6 {? As a result, I attempt to chase his LSB away, but it will not work because he will pin my f6 knight with 9.Bg5.} 9. Bg5 Qb6 {I also could have broken the pin with 9...h6, but I did not want to do that.  Instead, I wanted to attack his a1 rook and win his b2 pawn, but what was I thinking?  A pawn swap usually looses a chess game, in this position, as inadowman mentioned in my last annotation.  In addition, I might have also violated general opening principles.  That is because you are not supposed to bring your queen out so early, but this is move 9, not 2-4.  Therefore, I do not know if this move was a ?. } 10. Bxf6 {? I understand that he wanted to exchange pieces because he is ahead, but the exchange is not good due to the postion.  This is, afterall, an open position, so a bishop is worth more then a knight.  } Qxf6 {?? This was a serious blunder.  I should have recaptured with 10...gxf6, but I did not want doubled pawns (two pawns on one file).  There are times when doubled pawns are ok, but I abhor them.  That is because I believe that they weaken my position, even if they are ok or an advantage.  Of course, I do not usually know when doubled pawns are ok, unless you are going to castle or connect your rooks.  In this position, however, they would have been a serious tactical and strategical advantage. } 11. Bxb7 {!! This enables him to attack my a8 rook and capture my b7 pawn.  In this position, he will win my a8 rook, no matter what I do.  BTW, I have not been able to able to capture a pawn and win a rook, with a lonely LSB.  } Qxb2 {!! Therefore, I capture his b2 pawn and will win his a1 rook.  This is the most unusual position that I have seen, in all the years that I have been playing chess.} 12. Qe2+ {He places me in check, but I do not mind because this is a mere nuisance.} Be7 {! Therefore, I respond with my DSB, and I believe this was my best move. } 13. Qc4 {! In this position, he is clearly trying to get a Mate in One with 14.Qc8#, but I am not going to let him mate me.} Bb4+ {Although this is a nuisance check, it does prevent a mating move.  In this position, it is no longer possible for him to mate me with 14.Qc8 because I would respond with 14...Ke7 since my DSB is no longer on e7.} 14. Ke2 {I do not know why he played this, but 14.Nd6 would have been his best move.  } Qxa1 {At this point, I decide to capture his rook.  } 15. Qc8+ {Therefore, he responds with a serious check, so he will recapture a rook and be 6 points ahead with 15...Ke7 (forced) 16.Qxh8.  } Ke7 16. Qxh8 Qe5+ {For some reason, I decide to check him, but I feel that it was a, "wasted move", because this is just another burden.  Therefore, he can get out of check easily.} 17. Kf3 {! This move or 17.Kd3 are best, in this position.  If he had moved his king back on the 8th rank, I would mate him immediately with 17.Qe1#.  However, his king is now more exposed then my king, so he is now in serious trouble.} Nc6 {!! I made this move to give him my other rook, so this is the Deflective Sacrifice, not a blunder.  After 18.Qxa8 the game will be lost for white, even with a +9.  Until this game, I have resigned after falling behind by 9 points.} 18. Qxa8 Nd4+ {At this point, I now have an inevitable mating sequence against him, and that is the reason that I sac'd my other rook.  In addition, this move is a start to my sequence because he will be forced to play 19.Kg4. } 19. Kg4 Qf5+ {Therefore, I decide to place him another check, so 20.Kg3, or 20.Kh4 are his only options.  However, it does not matter where he moves the king because I will mate him, either way.} 20. Kg3 {In this position, it is a mate in four, and the mating solution is 20...Bd6+ 21.Kh4 (forced), g5+ 22.Kh5 (forced), Qg6+ 23.Kg4 (forced), f5+ 24.Kh3 (forced), Qh5#.} Bd6+ 21. Kh4 g5+ 22. Kh5 Qg6+ 23. Kg4 f5+ 24. Kh3 Qh5# {It is generally a bad idea to give away free pieces, unless it involves a Deflective Sacrifice.  In fact, Mr. Stockel would say, "Don't give things away".  However, Deflective Sacrifices are good because you are sacrificing material for something better including but not limited to a queen capture or mating sequence.  Therefore, this game proves that you can generally defeat your opponent with Deflective Sacrifices.  BTW, I already knew the definition of a Deflective Sacrifice, but I learned about its usefulness from a grandmaster (i have arrived).  Having said that, I want to thank i have arrived because I used techniques from some of his games to finish this game. }
