[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {The old favourite.} e5 {And the usual response.} 2. Nf3 {I develop my knight.} d6 {Defending the e5 pawn and opening a line for black's bishop.} 3. Nc3 {I develop my other knight.} c6 {c6, laying claim to d5 - stopping me putting my knight there later if I want to anyway.} 4. Be2 {Aware that black may pin my knight, I make a bad move. This was very passive, and a waste of time. Bb4 would have been a better bishop move, or h3 would have removed the threat of the pin.} Nf6 {Developing a knight.} 5. O-O {I castle.} b5 {Black has made a lot of pawn moves and only developed one piece. His development should be significantly worse than mine. But this move restricts the movements of my minor pieces and I'm starting to feel a bit cramped...} 6. b4 {Trying to halt blacks pawn push on my  queenside.} a5 {Another pawn move!} 7. bxa5 {I take, because my b4 pawn can't be defended easily.} Rxa5 {Black's roook now controls most of the a file.} 8. d4 {This might have been a good move if I'd played it earlier instead of b4!} b4 {Now I'm feeling really uncomfortable - my knight has no good squares other than back where it came from!} 9. Nb1 {So back it goes...} Nxe4 {Black wins a pawn.} 10. dxe5 {I also win a pawn - material is even.} dxe5 {Black takes back. A mistake I think...} 11. Qxd8+ { because I trade queens...} Kxd8 { ...dragging black's king one square into his rather airy queenside and preventing him being able to castle.} 12. Be3 {I'm trying to get my pieces out quickly now. I move my bishop to a square that is safe to stay on for a bit.} c5 {Preventing Bb6+...} 13. Nxe5 {I capture a pawn. Material is even again.} Be6 {Attacking my a2 pawn.} 14. Bg4 {Creating tactical complexity... I think his best move here is Rxa2. I haven't gone into any deep analysis here - but I've saved it as something to do on a rainy day!} f5 {A mistake I think, since it gives me the opportunity to force black's bishop off e6. Rxa2 would have been better?} 15. Bxf5 {I just take the pawn...} Bxf5 {Black captures my bishop...} 16. Nf7+ {And I fork his king and rook.} Kc8 {Black moves away - giving me a chance to win his rook and still get my knight out safely.} 17. Nxh8 {I take the rook. Now I am winning on material, although my pieces around a1 are still cramped and inactive.} Nd6 {Trying to prevent my knight from escaping...} 18. Bf4 {So I hit black's knight.} Nc6 {Black develops his other knight. Ra7 may have been better? I think my knight wouldn't have been able to get back into the game then.} 19. Bxd6 {I trade my bishop for blacks knight, making room for my knight to get out.} Bxd6 {Black recaptures.} 20. Nf7 {My knight is back out...} Bf4 {...but a bit hemmed in by black's bishops.} 21. g3 {I push black's bishop away.} Bc7 {Black retreats.} 22. Nd2 {Now I try to get my last pieces out...} Bxc2 {...at the expense of the pawn that I left hanging. I think this could have been the start of my problems!} 23. Rfc1 {Seems too late for this now - my pawn is gone!} Bg6 {The bishop moves to safety.} 24. Ng5 {As does my knight.} Nd4 {Threatening to fork my king and rook. Even though black has less material, his pieces are much better coordinated than mine, which are being chased everywhere!} 25. Kg2 {I move my king, avoiding the check.} Be5 {Black creates a discovered attack threat against my rook - 26. ? ...Ne2 would attack both my rooks!} 26. f4 {I try to force the bishop away.} Bf6 {He just moves to safety.} 27. Rcf1 {I get my rook out of range of black's knight.} Nf5 {Attacking my rook - forcing it to move and leaving the a2 pawn undefended.} 28. Rae1 {I move to an open file - but it doesn't help much. Black controls most of the board with his bishops.} Bc3 {Pinning my knight...} 29. Ngf3 {I defend it.} Rxa2 {Black grabs a free pawn, and attacks my knight again.} 30. Rf2 {I defend it again.} Nd6 {Preparing for Nc4?} 31. Ree2 {I try to defend my knight again.} Bd3 {But just get pushed away...} 32. Re3 {I attack black's bishop.} c4 {Which he just defends - advancing a pawn at the same time.} 33. Nf1 {Trying to swap pieces. Maybe I can mop up black's two pawns with less material on the board? (Although it wouldn't be easy!)} Rxf2+ {Accepts the swap...} 34. Kxf2 {I recapture.} Be4 {Moving his bishop to free the c4 pawn to move?} 35. Nf1d2 {I try to trade my knight for a bishop.} Bxd2 {Again, he accepts.} 36. Nxd2 {I take back.} Bc2 {But now I'm in real trouble... I can't find a clear route to get my king anywhere near black's pawns.} 37. Re5 {Trying to get behind them with my rook.} b3 {But black just keeps moving forward...} 38. Nxc4 {I capture a pawn, giving up my knight for it.} Nxc4 {Black grabs my knight.} 39. Rc5+ {I recapture after this check.} Kd7 {Move's out of check.} 40. Rxc4 {Taking my knight back...} b2 {...but black's pawn is unstoppable.} 41. Rb4 {I prepare to give up my rook...} b1=Q {Promotes.} 42. Rxb1 {I take.} Bxb1 {And lose my rook.} 43. Kf3 {Now I'm hoping to capture black's last two pawns to draw. Is this even possible? Should I have just resigned here?} Ke6 {But black's king get's there first.} 44. Kg4 {I keep going...} Be4 {But now I'm really in trouble. All my moves are pretty much forced from this point onwards.} 45. h4 {I make one of my few remaining moves.} h5+ {This is a trap...} 46. Kxh5 {...and I fall right into it! Does g5 lose too? I think it does - but more slowly than what happens next.} Kf5 {Now I have no choices at all...} 47. g4+ {I make the only move I can.} Kxf4 {Black continues with his winning endgame combination.} 48. g5 {I make the only move I have.} Bf5 {Black prepares to finish it.} 49. g6 {I make my last remaining move.} Bg4# {And it's all over. Lesson learned!  Thanks for looking at this game! Hope you enjoyed it. Please leave comments and give it your star rating.}
