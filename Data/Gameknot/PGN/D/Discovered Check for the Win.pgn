1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 g6 {Queen's pawn game? I don't know of any other opening name for this.} 4. Bg5 Ne4 5. Nxe4 dxe4 6. Ne5 f6 {Gotta watch out for those forks.} 7. Bh6 Bxh6 {A surprising move by white. Didn't see any reason not to capitalize on it.} 8. Nc4 Nc6 9. e3 Be6 10. Na3 a6 {Since white was kind enough to deploy his knight all the way to the side of the board, I'm willing to keep it there.} 11. Bc4 Bxc4 {White is behind in material, any even exchange favors black at this point.} 12. Nxc4 b5 13. Na3 Qd5 14. Qg4 f5 15. Qh3 Bg7 {And now white's queen is on the edge of the board too, and fairly well bottled up by black's pawns.} 16. O-O Nb4 17. c3 Nd3 {I could have taken the pawn at a2, but that would leave my knight with no safe retreat and tie my queen down to guard duty. So I put him in place to be a thorn in white's side til the end of the game.} 18. b4 a5 19. bxa5 Rxa5 {Time to play with the rook, give him something to do. Like eat pawns...} 20. Rfd1 Rxa3 {I am not sure what white was doing, threatening a protected knight while he had an endangered knight of his own. Well, my rook didn't mind a knight appetizer on his way to munching pawns.} 21. Qg3 Kd7 22. h3 Rxa2 23. Rxa2 Qxa2 {Gobbling more material.} 24. f3 Qc2 25. Rf1 exf3 26. gxf3 Qxc3 {Munch, munch, munch.} 27. Rb1 b4 {I think I need a 2nd queen. What else are passed pawns good for?} 28. d5 b3 29. e4 Rg8 {Now a sneaky plan falls into place. I had to move or protect the bishop (or just trade pawns, but I had an inkling of a sneaky discovered pin.} 30. exf5 gxf5 31. Rf1 Bd4+ {! And it worked! White's last move should have been to move his king or queen somewhere safe.} 32. Kg2 Qd2+ {? Kg2 was wrong, as black's response shows. Kh2 lets white drag it out a bit longer.}
