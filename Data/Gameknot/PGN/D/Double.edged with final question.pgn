1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Bd7 {My opponent lost a game before, so he tried to be clam and quiet, without taking risks. } 3. Nf3 Nc6 {I don't recommend this knight move, but it's a matter of personal taste. } 4. e3 Nf6 5. h3 {Discussed if a loss of time or not. My bet is a queenside castling and a pawn's storm on the kingside. That's why I play this. } e6 6. g4 Be7 7. Ne5 {Black's defence is not dull. I have to play actively to break in. } Nxe5 8. dxe5 Ne4 {This is the "well-placed-but-not-dangerous knight"... provided I have a knight on f3 so to proceed with h4, blocking black's dsb. But now it is different. } 9. Qf3 {Even so, this queen move helps the whole thing to stick together. If Bh4, white can afford to defend with Bg3. } c6 {Freeing the way for the queen. } 10. Bd3 {Preparing to get rid of this knight once for all. And not a bit too soon. } Qa5+ 11. c3 Qb6 {Smart! Now I should have played b3, and no problem after BxN. But I choosed} 12. Qe2 {It was a mistake. } Bh4 {I deserved it, but I am prepared against this. } 13. Bxe4 {Forced. And I won't retake the pawn. } dxe4 {and I can't move Nd2. What a mess I did with my position!} 14. g5 {"Be like water, my friend. It always finds the way out"... :-D} h6 15. gxh6 gxh6 16. Rg1 {This column can be useful. I'm thinking in f7. Black should castle queenside at once. } c5 {This is to bring the bishop into action, but it is a blunder, because of my following line. } 17. Rg7 Bb5 {Black rejects the queen, yes, but shields itself from the attack on b2, giving me the tempo to go...} 18. Qh5 {...threatening f7. } Bxf2+ {The good thing about this is my king becomes in check after a future Qxb2. } 19. Kxf2 O-O-O {Black also has my queenside pieces completely tied up. Now the position is extremely doubled-edged and exciting to play. } 20. Qxf7 {Being my dsb almost useless, and the other two pieces tied to their initial squares, the only way I have to balance the game - my king almost on a clear field - are the Queen and Rook power on the 7th rank. But black can counter it. } Be8 21. Qe7 {Inviting my enemy to give the check! but assuring the next move will be lethal. } Qxb2+ {He accepts the challenge. } 22. Kg3 {And now what? My opponent blundered, but... did black have some chance? In my view, his only option was...} Rd7 23. Qxc5+ Kb8 24. Rxd7 Bxd7 25. Qd6+ Kc8 {...and we get into this position, that seems to be a drawn, since I don't see how white can lose the rook and get a decisive advantage. Can you, dear reader?} 26. Bxh6 {Now, let's explore this sac. Remember white loses the rook in a1 in a very, very cramped position when the knight is hard to defend but retiring the queen. } Rxh6 {Black omits Rg8, that leads to mate. But see: } 27. Qf8+ Kc7 28. Qxh6 {Ok, now...} Qxa1 {White has to defend the knight. Material is almost even. How to proceed? White has a free pawn on the h file. But not so near to promotion to leave the black queen do her work of destruction. } 29. Nd2 {If black defends the pawn with the bishop, Qxd6 gives white a strong edge. } Qxc3 30. Nxe4 {Is a very nice "Knight ball". e3 is defended - the key pont - . Now, what can do black with the queen? Harass the white king, of course! :-)} Qe1+ 31. Kf3 {White can retire the knight, but I always explore the less passive move first. This one has a dangerous downside. } Bc6 {Here has white a defence? Which move? } 32. Qxe6 {Not this one, but Qh7+. } Qh1+ {Black doesn't seize the chance of Qf1+, followed by BxN. But is a matter of choice, the knight is lost. } 33. Kf4 Qxe4+ {...and in spectacular fashion! Black needs the tempo.} 34. Kg5 {No way for white to avoid the loss of another pawn. } Qxe3+ 35. Kf6 {Trying to see what happens if white allows Qd6+} Qh6+ 36. Ke7 {Question for students: should black go for the queen's exchange or not? I'm still wondering... :-) }
