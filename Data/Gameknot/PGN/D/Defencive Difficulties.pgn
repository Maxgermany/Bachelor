[Opening "Budapest (A52), Adler variation"]

1. d4 {a fun sacrificial game} Nf6 2. c4 e5 {The Budapest Defence. Black cracks open the positon with an early e5, although he'll have to move his knight again black will be compensated by whites weak central pawns. also people who play 1.d4 tend to prefer closed positions so this provocative opening is good for getting players into unfamiliar positions with lots of tactical traps for white to fall into. note that in the long run white can't hope to hold on to the pawn on e5, except with an early f4 but black will get good compensation for the pawn} 3. dxe5 Ng4 {the main alternative here in Ne4 but due to the responce 4.a3! black ends up with very little play.} 4. Nf3 {Bf4 is a better way to defend the pawn} d6 {offering a pawn for development. after exd6 Bxd6 there are some nasty traps that can often catch some of the unprepared.} 5. exd6 Bxd6 6. e3 {sensibly avoiding the trap, if white doesn't prtect his queen or free up the e2 square black can here play Nxf2 when he bags at least the exchange as Kxf2 loses the queen to Bg3 !} O-O {getting the king out of the way so black can start trying to exploit his development advantage as white can't try to develop with check} 7. h3 {now it is safe to kick the knight } Nf6 8. Be2 {black is also tring to castle early. as the centre is so open it makes sence to try and get the king to safety} Be6 {pressuring the exposed c pawn} 9. a3 {? only allowing blacks development advantage to grow. castling or developing a piece would be better here} Nc6 10. b4 {white is trying to claim space on the queenside but this is a bit premature, his pieces cannont control the queenside from there starting squares} b6 {?! preventing the annoying c5 push but prehaps immediately striking at the white pawns with a5 was better here} 11. Bb2 {finally developing another piece} Qd7 {black aims to bring his rooks to the open files as quickly as possible} 12. O-O Rad8 {black can even play the sacrifice Bxh3 here as white is so poorly developed} 13. Qa4 {? why does the queen need to go to a4? it does absolutely nothing there} Rfe8 14. Bxf6 {doubling my f pawns, but white has just traded his best piece and opened my g file towards his scantly protected kingside} gxf6 15. Nc3 {here i decide i need to make something happen, after such poor play from white he needs to be punished...} Bxh3 {black cannot possibly take the bishop here as after Qxh3 white has a hard time finding any cover for his king and white can simply play Kh8 followed by Rg8 and white is already losing} 16. Nh4 Kh8 {white still can't take the bishop for the very same reasons, so the black king steps aside to allow a rook access to the g file} 17. Qc2 {realising his queen is completely offside white sets about getting her into the action} Bxg2 {?! not a very strong sacrifice, black should simply add to his pressure with moves like Rg8.} 18. Nxg2 {obviously not Kxg2 which loses instantly to Rg8 } Qh3 19. f4 {! strong defencive move, both blocks out the darksquare bishop and opens the 2nd rank for the white queen} Reg8 {? black needs to work hard to prove the sacrifice was any good. here black could take a draw by Rxe3 when after 20.Nxe3 Rg8  21.Ng4 Qg3  he has perpetual, but black doesn't want to let white get away with his earlier mistakes so lightly.} 20. Bf3 Bxf4 {! the only way black can possibly play for an advantage, black needs as many pieces as possible in this attack and those pawns are keeping 2 of them out. this way at least one of the knight and bishop can participate. } 21. exf4 Nd4 22. Qf2 {! the best square for the queen} Rg3 {? threatening the bishop and preparing to double rooks.} 23. Bd5 {! yet another great defencive move, blocks the file for the rook and makes the kinght en prise} Rdg8 {? white cant take the knight as his g2 knight drops with mate but black overlooks a simple tactic that allows white exchange off the knight} 24. Ra2 {?! Ne2 wins on the spot here as it forces off my knight and then black has nothing for his 2 pieces except some superficial pressure on the white king which is easily dealt with} Nf5 {the knight needs to get further into the action and avoiding Ne2} 25. Qe1 {?! giving black unnessicary chances. after the brilliant defending so far black should be completely lost} Ne3 {the best chance, black needs all his pieces to be working harmoniously if the attack is going anywhere} 26. Rff2 Ng4 {now black has some real threats on the black king, which is alot more than he deserves} 27. Ne4 {? this shows just how difficult defending is, all those great defencive moves earlier wrecked by a couple of not so good ones. } Re3 28. Qa1 {?? loses on the spot, white should give back some material by Nxe3 when after 28...Nxe3  29.Ng5 white is up a rook for 2 pawns and blacks attack has lost some steam} Qh2+ {and white resigns as its mate next move. it just shows how difficult defending is in chess, 2 moves both which look perfectly natural and logical can lead to an attack that has no prospect becoming quite threatening with real chances and one big blunder can lead to an instant loss. as always if you have any questions or comments about the game please feel free to message me.}
