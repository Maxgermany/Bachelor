1. e4 {and so it begins e4!} e5 2. Bc4 {bishop out!} a6 {hmm right away with the a6.  ill try something here i have never tried since its a blitz!} 3. a4 {is this an appropriate reply? i didnt want to move my LSB lol,  after this move my opponent took a good 30 seconds to choose what to play, i guess i threw him off.} Nf6 {finally develops a piece. and attacks e4} 4. Nc3 {develop + defend e4} Bc5 {sigh of relief. havent seen this DSB parking spot in a few games.} 5. Nge2 {i like sending my knight there to be able to play f4 or d4.} Ng4 {alright hes already attacking!} 6. d4 {d4 it is!} exd4 {decides to capture and i recapture} 7. Nxd4 Qf6 {the queen is out! the checkmate is looming!. well im giving him my rook and ill look to develop during his attack} 8. Nf3 {and so i play this in defense} Nxf2 {follows through with his plan} 9. Qd5 {i decided to place my queen here and get ready to develop my DSB and create tons of pressure} d6 {opens the way for his lsb } 10. Bg5 {develop DSB gain time on queen} Qe6 {offers exchange. i got enough coverage on d5 to let him do the exchange.} 11. Rf1 {save my rook. im willing to trade out rook for his knight and DSB if he still wants to trade out queens} Ng4 {retreats the knight! allows for my long castle!} 12. O-O-O {so i sneak it in.  now i was thinking to myself this whole time i cant screw up here i got all this development at the cost of a pawn thats it. im up to about 8 mins time bank at this stage. my opponent was up to 6 mins about. this game was played very fast by me. i was happy about the way i played it.} Qxd5 {forces the exchange being up a pawn} 13. Nxd5 {i decide to recapture with knight aiming for c7 at same time plus my LSB is ready to work with my rooks.} Bb6 {thought he would do that. good ill take his DSB off and he will have double pawns} 14. Nxb6 cxb6 {all i got to do is move his knight now. id love it if he would exchange it on e5} 15. h3 {kick} Ne5 {why thank you mate} 16. Nxe5 {exchange that i would love!} dxe5 17. Bxf7+ {oops!} Kf8 18. Be6+ {oh oh!} Ke8 19. Rd8# {i hope you enjoyed it! i wanted to keep this one hehe. all comments appreciated. ps. damalfi, i felt invigorated by your nice blitz vs a GM, annotation, to try a blitz and it got me this nice result hehe.}
