[Opening "Evans gambit (C52)"]

1. e4 {This is my norm opening, I decided not to change this as it is my fave. Those of you who know me is I don't like boring openings which in my opinion is almost everything apart from 1.e4. After 1.e4 there are loads of fun and wild gambits! In thi game you'll see one of them.} e5 {This is my favourite response as it lets me play my fave opening, which you will see. There are many other responses, 1...e6 (yawn) 1.c6 (solid and I sometimes play it but it is boring) 1...c5 Sicilian well if this happens I'll play the Smith morra Gambit.} 2. Nf3 {Standard.} Nc6 {Standard.} 3. Bc4 {The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?(This is a very nice gambit which I have a few annotated games of "Naval Intelligence" a very nice little game!.) } Bc5 {The Guicco Piano. This is less agressive than the Two Knight's defence. I now has the chance to play my fave as I have already mentioned, the Evan's Gambit 4.b4!?} 4. b4 {This is the Evans Gambit. This romantic gambit has proven to be greatly resilient to modern technology, while it is not generally thought of as a path to advantage it hasn't been refuted(correct me if I'm wrong).The idea of this opening is to gain momentum while opening the centre., this is often at the expense of a pawn or two.For this reason this line of the Guoco Piano has often attracted attention from more aggressive players and and will probably continue to do so in the future. Even Garry Kasparov found the opening worth playing a few times.  He even used it to beat none other than ANAND! Pretty good surprise weapon,no?} Bxb4 {It is often said that the way to refute a gambit is to accept it. Black grabs a pawn so as to have the option of uploading it in a later stage in the game in order to neutralize whites resulting initiative.} 5. c3 {This is the plan of giving away the b4 pawn to gain tempo by forcing black to move his bishop repetitively while he gains  momentum in the centre.. } Ba5 {This retreat is probably the most natural responce to the Evans Gambit.The e1-a5 diagonal, pinning the c3 and d2 pawns for the momentand, more importantly is not in any kind of trouble on a5. or instance it would be in danger on c5 because of d4. Or 5.Be7 which is solid yet deemed passive. On the other side though white will be able to put pressure on blacks position with Ba3 later on. Black's plan to meet this is with d2-d3.} 6. d4 {White seizes space in the centre. Alternatives here are the imediate 6.0-0 which is not so popular or 6.Qb3!? which starts an immediate atack. These moves are interchangeable though and are normally played at some stage of the game. I recommend my chosen move.} d6 {As I said. Again logical solidifying the e5 pawn and also stopping the danger of Ba3. An adequate and more common alternative is 6...exd4.} 7. O-O {I castle to get my king into safety before  start my attack. This move also breaks the pin on the c3 pawn.} exd4 {Black takes the pawn a common effective move.} 8. cxd4 {I recapture building up my space advantage in the centre.} Bb6 {Now we have reached a very common position from the Evan's Gambit. There are two main options I can take. I can aim for long term compensation with 9.d5 which Anderssen preffered. Many games with 9.d5 continue like 9...Na5 10.Bb2 Ne7 11. Bd3 0-0 12.Nc3 Ng6 13. Ne2 c5 14.Qd2 f6 15. Kh1 Rb8 16.Ng3. This would be the strategic positional approach with less attacking chances wich doesn't suit my style.. I prefer Morphy's more tactical and logical developing move 9.Nc3, when I maintain possibilities of advancing either of my two central pawns according to Black's moves. This is obviously a more dynamic approach.} 9. Nc3 {! I decide Morphy's dynamic logical approach. It is often thought by beginners that when you have gambited a pawn you need to attack and mate as soon as possible with out developing there pieces, this often results in a failed attack. Morphy believed that all pieces should be involved in an attack. This seems subtle and lets Black off the hook because it is too quiet but it builds up my forces for my attack.} Nf6 {? This move looks like a good developing move however it is one of the traps of Morphy's continuation. This leaves Black in trouble, this will show you why. People really stop falling for this trap against me because whenever they play this horrible move they always lose.} 10. e5 {! Immediately putting pressure on Black's position and attacking the Black Knight.} dxe5 {Black does exactly whatI wanted him to do. he opens the a3-f8 diagonal for my bishop to attack.} 11. Ba3 {! This builds up pressure on the Kingside and prevents castling.} exd4 {?This is a poor move. Amarg tried 11.e4?? which failed miserable as this move did! Pawn grabbing doesn't pay.} 12. Re1+ {I' keep the attack going. You'd think I did this so the pawn couldn't take my knight on c3 but I'm gonna sac it so I don't really care about that!} Be6 {?? This fails completely as you will see, however this move is the only move possible.} 13. Qb3 {! I build up the pressure!} dxc3 {?? Not again! Black should be doing something that defends his King. Instead he just takes material. 'Goodbye horsey seeya in Hell!'} 14. Bxe6 {This wins a pawn and ultimateley results in mate.} fxe6 15. Qxe6+ {Check.} Ne7 16. Rad1 {! I now have full control of the central files.} Bxf2+ { ? think this was a poor attemt at an interference move. As you will see it doesn't interfere with my invisible attack for long!} 17. Kxf2 Ng4+ {Well if this was the whole point of 16...Bxf2  then i'm really scared! Lol!} 18. Kg1 {I retreat the King.} c5 {Nothing can prolong mate now. 'Hahahahahhahahhahahh' sorry did i do that outloud?} 19. Rxd8+ Kxd8 20. Qd6+ Kc8 21. Rxe7 Nxh2 22. Qc7# {Checkmate! This game shows the effectiveness of gambits especiaklly in Blitz games where Black often seems to get disorientated in the wild position and goes pawn grabbing.
