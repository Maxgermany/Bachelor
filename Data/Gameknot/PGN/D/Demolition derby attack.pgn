1. e4 c5 2. f4 {This has fallen out of fashion a while ago because it theoretically allows black to equalize immediately with the tal gambit by 2...d5 however I had a specific variation in mind} d5 3. Nf3 {The opening begins with this strange looking gambit. I guess it could be something of reversed Budapest in which white has used the extra tempo to play f2-f4 and it is unclear weather this helps or hurts whites cause} dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 {This obvious attack on the f7 square can be easily dispelled with the simple ...e6 and it may be best, in that case white will eventually get back the e pawn and it will be roughly an equal game however with blacks next move it shows that my opponent intends to go all out for the win.} Bg4 {The perfect way to take advantage of whites earlier f4. Now if white wants to get anything out of the position a queen sac is practically forced, and yet this is exactly what I had been hoping for from move 1} 6. Qxg4 {Though this may appear quite extraordinary for those who have not seen this particular line before I can say that this position has Infact been seen many a time before especially here on gameknot. Although there is still plenty of speculation As to the soundness of this sacrifice i can say my personal opinion is that it is sound and perfectly playable, providing white with adequate compensation for the queen,as well I know that quite a few other people who have done some work into this line have also attested to the general soundness of the queen sac. Actually this is probably whites most accurate move so far this game} Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 {Kc7 is also possible as well however that after the bishop takes the knight a royal fork is threatened and black must move the queen to avoid it. Of course this is the more human move and is my personal preference } 9. Bxg4 {The smoke has cleared and white has two pieces for the queen as well as other advantages to sweeten the deal, as for the developmental situation on move 9 we have white having developed a bishop and knight and black having developed the king.} e6 {This is probably where black has to make a real decision most of the moves up to here have been fairly obvious. There are several possibilities at this point, though I feel that this may be the best bet for black, at this point we are still well within established theory} 10. Nc3 Na6 11. a3 {As in Mackenzie-Pruess Reno 06 and in gameknots Dana-Freddy. The beauty of this gambit is that is that whites strategy is not usually about launching a fierce attack against the centre strewn king but instead white usually aims to restrict blacks pieces, especially the queen well white will look to maintain piece coordination. Because of this white can afford to make slow restricting moves as this one.} Bd6 {Dana-Freddy continued 11...Qd4 12.Nxe6 Qd7 which ran into 13.d4!! And white had an excellent attack } 12. O-O Nc7 13. Ncxe4 Rf8 {And now we have the first deviation from Mackenzie-Pruess, That game continued with ...Qe7 and white eventually went on to win. From this point I'm on my own.} 14. d3 {And already one move on my own and I may have made a slip up. There were a number of principles developed for these types of positions, and one of those principles is that given the chance white should look for opportunities to exchange a knight for bishop, and here is a perfect opportunity to do so. } h6 15. Nxe6 {Even here instead of going after the pawn it may have been best to rid black of his his bishop. After 15. Nxd6 Qxd6 16.Ne4 white seems to keeping thins together. A computer may disagree with my analysis however computers don't really understand these positions. Having said that 16...Qe4+ 17.Kh1 g5 does give black very annoying unitive which is not something that white wants to allow, so maybe this is alright} Nxe6 16. Bxe6 Be5 {I overlooked this actually, taking the bishop is a no go for white since it runs in to all sorts of trouble after ...Qd4+} 17. Rf3 {The computer doesn't seem to like this move and gives the position as less than1 for black after 17.a4 providing the following line 17.a4 Bd4+ 18.Kh1 a6 19.c3 Be5 20.Rf3 Qh4 21.Be3 Bxf4 22.g3 Qe7 23.Bxc5 Qe6 24.Bxf8 Rxf8 25.Rxf4 Rxf4 26.gxf4 Which seems maybe alright however it looks like black is going to be able to seriously disrupt all those pawns. However to be honest I don't really understand why a4 is the suggestion here, is it just to prevent black getting in b5 or something?} Qh4 18. Be3 {Effectively forced, however I didn't mind giving up pawns, I already sacrificed my queen so a couple extra pawns don't mean much} Bxb2 19. Rb1 Bd4 20. Bxd4 cxd4 21. c4 Kc7 {I don't really understand the reasoning behind this move either It seems that black could be improving the position of the pieces here not moving the king to a square that appears to be even worse than the square it was already on since now it is liable to checks } 22. Bd5 Rab8 23. Nc5 {More pressure on b7 and I'm also threatning a fork on e6} Rfe8 24. Rg3 {I felt this move put up the most resistance} g5 25. f5 {This pawn is now a passed pawn, and after all passed pawns must be pushed! It's a bonus that the promotion square is also forking square } Re3 26. f6 {Passed pawns must be pushed} Rxg3 27. hxg3 Qxg3 28. f7 {Passed pawns must be pushed!} Qe3+ 29. Kh1 h5 {The computer calls this move an inaccuracy and now thinks that after 30.Rxb7+ black has to go for are perpetual check. Actually I though that at this point I could Play 30.Na6+ however the problem is blacks queen can cover the promotion square for example ...bxa6 Rxb8 Qc1+ Kh2 Qf4+ and only then does black capture my rook.} 30. Ne6+ Kd6 31. Rxb7 Rh8 {Now I can no longer keep the threat of promotion, I have to promote now } 32. f8=B+ {My own personal sense of humor if given the chance I will always under promote if it doesn't hurt my position } Rxf8 {Of course black still snatches it off} 33. Nxf8 Qc1+ 34. Kh2 Qf4+ 35. Kg1 Qxf8 36. Rf7 {A bit of a misstep, Rxa7 was clearly the better move} Qb8 37. Rb7 Qe8 38. Be4 Qa4 39. Kh2 {Getting off the back rank } Qxa3 40. Rb5 Qc1 41. c5+ {Passed pawns must be pushed } Ke6 42. c6 {Passed pawns must be pushed} h4 {In the mean time black continues to push foward in a systematic manner, eventually the g pawn is going to come to g3 and leave me stuck on the back rank, it was only now that I realized just how dire my position was} 43. Ra5 Qf4+ 44. Kh1 {Probably g1 was a better square since it denies the queen access to f2} g4 45. Rxa7 g3 46. Ra1 {Now my rook is confined to the back rank and I clearly have no winning chances sine the king will always be able to prevent my pawn from promoting, though at this point I didn't see blacks exact winning method yet so I played on to see how black would finish it off} Kd6 47. Rb1 h3 {The problem is that black will eventually win d3 and I will have two passed pawns to contend with.} 48. Rg1 {This is just a blunder} hxg2+ 49. Bxg2 {Another blunder,bits now mate in two} Qh4+ {}
