1. c4 {This game was played on a bitterly cold night, in a big hall where the heating had failed.  We all started off in normal dress but by the end had donned extra jumpers and overcoats.  My opponent played at a normal slow rate but, after my first few deliberate moves, I sped up, using his thinking time to plan my own moves.  This worked well until move 25, when I blundered, and again thereafter, so that, by the time I'd equalised, my opponent had only 15 minutes left, compared with my 68 minutes.  However, I wasn't in a mood to try to exploit my time advantage as I was in a hurry to find warmth ...} e5 {I've never really had a favourite system against the English Opening but this reply has been serving me well on Gameknot recently.} 2. g3 g6 {aiming for King's Indian type position ...} 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. d3 Nf6 5. e4 {I was quite surprised that White chose to block the position at this stage.} O-O 6. Ne2 {I assumed this was aimed at an early f4 but that never came.  It could also have helped an advance to d4, leaving the B protecting e4 but that didn't come either, so I'm not sure what the purpose of this, rather than 6. Nf3, was.} d6 7. O-O Nc6 {Happy to develop my pieces to natural squares.} 8. Nbc3 Ne7 {But now I wanted both to contest d5 and prepare for ...f5.  I didn't yet have a clear idea of where to put my LSB but didn't want to swap it on d5.} 9. h3 {Presumably he didn't want my minor pieces to use g4 so that his B could develop to e3 without being harassed.} c6 10. Be3 Be6 11. a3 {Another slow move.  While I was looking at launching a kingside attack, it looked like White was preparing a queenside attack.} Qd7 12. Kh2 Ne8 {Preparing ...f5.  12...Nh5 would have invited 13. g4 at this stage, which wouldn't have helped me with my plan.} 13. Rc1 {White continues with his quiet development.} f5 {and I continue with my planned assault.  My QR can stay where it is until it can double on the f file.} 14. b4 {White hopes to expand on the queenside and eventually queen a pawn, I think. } a6 {I felt it was necessary to delay his advance before continuing with my kingside plan.} 15. a4 {Now I didn't see any value in further attempts at obstruction, so proceeded with my plan.} Nf6 16. b5 Nh5 {With my pawn on f5, the N is safe on h5 and supports the next planned advance.} 17. Qd2 {A multi-purpose move, supporting the queenside advance and discouraging ...f4 and threatening Bh6 to swap off my fianchettoed B.} d5 {Also multi-purposed.  It leads to a major swap-off that virtually clears the queenside of pawns and pieces.} 18. bxc6 bxc6 19. cxd5 cxd5 20. exd5 Nxd5 21. Nxd5 Bxd5 22. Bxd5+ Qxd5 {I was quite happy with this position, feeling that this left me with the better attacking options.} 23. Rc5 Qd6 24. Rfc1 {White beats me to doubling his rooks.  It looks like he may be able to outflank me before I can strike.} f4 {White has trapped his own B but has counter-attacking options.} 25. Rc5c6 {and now I thought that I could just nick the B and ignore the attack on my Q as my pawn would also attack his Q but I was temporarily overlooking the forthcoming check from a2, even though I had previously considered its possibility.  This is the penalty for not taking enough time to think.} fxe3 {?} 26. Qa2+ {! Now White wins my Q.} Kh8 27. Rxd6 {but I didn't resign as I worked out that I had some useful counter-attacking options that just might level the game up.} Rxf2+ 28. Kg1 Nxg3 {I exploit the pin on the Ne2 to pinch a pawn and take up closer order with White's K.  Now I expected 29. Rc2 to relieve the pin and defend the N but White surprised me with ....} 29. Re1 {? White defends his pawn but leaves the N pinned.  This was after a long think ...} Raf8 {Part of my long-term plan now achieved and I have hopes of developing a mating net.} 30. Qd5 {?! A strong centralising move that threatens to swap rooks on my back row - but it gives up the Ne2, allowing me to nearly equalise.} Nxe2+ 31. Rxe2 {? allowing me to actually take a material lead on conventional scoring.} Rxe2 32. Rd8 Ref2 {Restoring my strong rook formation and avoiding back row embarrassment.} 33. Rxf8+ Rxf8 34. Qe4 {Forcing me to choose between my two e-pawns.} Bh6 {I save the more advanced pawn allowing White to capture on e5 with check if he so wishes in the hope that I can create counter-chances with the advanced pawn.} 35. Qxe5+ Kg8 36. Qe6+ Kg7 37. Qe7+ {and White offered a draw, which I gladly accepted as I was relieved not to have lost and didn't have the desire to freeze while trying to win.  He couldn't see a way of both developing a material  advantage and preventing my pawn from queening.}
