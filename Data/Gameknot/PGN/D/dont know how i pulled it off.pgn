1. d4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. f4 c5 4. e3 {And I never seen this move before, but his rating is 1660 so I tought its dangeraus} cxd4 5. exd4 Nc6 6. Nf3 Nf6 7. Bd3 h6 8. O-O a6 9. Re1 {Re1 made my pawn on f4 much better, he has f5 defended by Bd3, and I have Nc3 that should be usefull later} Be7 10. f5 O-O {after he made  OO, I had something in mind- Bxh6 followed by xh6 and made his king side opened for attack} 11. Nh4 Nxd4 12. Bxh6 gxh6 {so i did it... maybe it works maybe not- i must do something with Nf6 } 13. Re3 Nh7 14. Rg3+ Ng5 15. Qh5 {had my queen involeved in action soon enough to make mate easy possible; situation for black isnt so good} Kg7 16. Nxd5 {i want to check with pawn and than attack by knight; but i didnt see that black knight on defending the f (five) _ my numbers seems not to work} exd5 17. f6+ Bxf6 18. c3 Nde6 {this was a big mistake if he put knight on c(six) i couldt check on f(five) and i would lose probably} 19. Nf5+ {afther this black resigned: dont know why but i had good attack on h(six) ;than rook on g(five)_ bishop must take it and than mate with queen on g(seven) i dont know how i pulled it off; my first good sacrifice::: hope u enjoyed}
