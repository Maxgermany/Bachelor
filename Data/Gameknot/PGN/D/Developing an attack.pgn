1. e4 {This was a fun one. Playing against a 1600+ opponent for the first time here at Gameknot, I not only held my own, but walked away with a victory. I think that the key to winning this one was my edge in development, as that allowed me to make multiple threats in quick succession that my opponent just couldn't match.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bc4 Nc6 5. O-O h6 {Up to this point, the game has been pretty standard, although I think h6 shouldn't be played until necessary for black.} 6. d4 exd4 7. Nxd4 Nxd4 8. Qxd4 {I have a nice lead in development, but he can push the queen back with tempo, so it's not quite as great as it appears.} c5 9. Qd3 Be7 10. Re1 a6 11. b3 {Preparing for Bb2} b5 12. Bd5 Nxd5 13. exd5 {I had been planning this bit since c5, as I wanted to open up the file for my rook.} O-O {It doesn't look like a particularly strong position right now, but here's where all the fun starts. :)} 14. Qg3 {Pinning the g-pawn to his king and threatening Bxh6. Note that this wouldn't have been a problem for him if he hadn't played h6 instead of developing earlier.} Kh7 {Defending the pawn, but putting his king on an easily accessible diagonal for my queen.} 15. Ne4 {Centralizing the knight. This would be the last move I make without a direct threat for some time.} Bb7 16. Qd3 {Threatining mate with Nf6+!} g6 17. Qe3 {Now the pawn on h6 is inadequately guarded so here goes!} g5 {He's defended everything so far, but look at how those pawns that were guarding his king are just marching forwards...} 18. Qd3 {Since the b1-h7 diagonal was cleared by that pawn move, it's back to the discovered attack.} Kg8 19. Bb2 {Here's where the REAL fun starts. Just one more threat to the equation.} f6 {The most natural defense, but dooms black completely. Can you figure out what the next move for white is without peeking?} 20. Nxg5 {Obviously, not taking the knight isn't good for black, as it poses dual threats of a Ne6 fork and Qh7#. However, taking it opens black up to the following little sequence.} hxg5 21. Qg6+ {If he had taken with fxg5, that would merely change this move to checkmate.} Kh8 {The ONLY move.} 22. Re3 {Rh3# is the threat, let's see what he's got.} g4 {Although it prevents mate, I think I prefer Bc8 here. Either way the followup is similar though.} 23. Rae1 {Doubling rooks, and targeting that immobile bishop at e7.} Qe8 {This surprised me. I expected Re8, adding another defender to the bishop. (However, that falls to 24. Rxe7, Rxe7 25. Bxf6#)} 24. Qh6+ {Getting my queen out of the way with tempo, now to take that bishop.} Kg8 25. Re3xe7 {I've made up the material from the knight sacrifice, and now black is in serious trouble. I'm threatening both his queen and checkmate, and there's just no way for him to protect both of them. Realizing this, my opponent resigned, and thus ended this fun game.  I think my opponent's main mistake this game was in wasting too much time with his pawns. Comparing pawn structures at endgame, I only moved 3 of my pawns, whereas not one of his pawns is still on its original square. Since he never really developed his pieces, he couldn't mount a good defense once my attack was prepared.}
