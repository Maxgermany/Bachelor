1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I know my star was NOT shining brightly in my latest loss against Master Freddy (Easy19) but this afternoon I logged on to my PC and was given a welcome message by Gameknot - Game Won (Checkmate) Congratulations!  A welcome end to a losing run of 5 games.  How did I do this, well, read on ........} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - pretty standard Sicilian stuff!} g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Bd7 7. Qd2 {7. Qd2 - standard moves leading to a Yugoslav type attack.} Nc6 8. f3 b6 {8. .......... b6 - unusual.} 9. O-O-O a6 10. Nxc6 Bxc6 11. Bc4 Bxc3 12. Qxc3 {12. Qxc3 - after developing Fou Leblanc to one of his best squares in the opening there is an exchange of knights.  My opponent now needs to do something about that cannon on h8 or it will be fodder for Glenda!  Black chooses to close off that diagonal with f6, but this move is about to allow a tactical shot as you will see.} f6 13. Qb3 Kf8 {13. .......... Kf8 - I could now go a pawn up with Q or B x b6 but aha, the opposing king has moved onto the h6-f8 diagonal!  Aha, there is a black steed on g8 which is defended by both black king and rook, but I see a way to win at least the exchange.  First comes a removal of the guard with Bxg8.} 14. Bxg8 Rxg8 {14. ........ Rxg8, forced unless black wishes to drop a whole piece, but look, nothing now guards h6 so Fou Lenoir gleefully goes there.  Now if black moves his king to e8 then Qxg8  wins hands down as I will immediately exchange queens after nabbing that rook!} 15. Bh6+ Rg7 {15. .......... Rg7 limits the damage to the exchange.} 16. Bxg7+ Kxg7 17. Rhe1 Ra7 18. h4 {18. h4 - I start a vague plan of trying to prise open the black kingside and use my extra rook to then exploit this along with Glenda and the other rook.} Rd7 19. f4 Qc7 20. Qf3 b5 {20. ........... b5 - black tries some counterplay down the queenside.} 21. g4 Qa5 22. a3 b4 23. Qe3 {23. Qe3 - Glenda moves out of the pin by the enemy lsb but keeps a careful eye on the pawn on b4 and the Wicked Witch of the West.  She is fully prepared to come on to the a file if necessary to neutralise the Witch's power on that file.} Qb5 24. e5 Bd5 25. exf6+ Kxf6 {25. ......... Kxf6?? Suicide, Suicide and double suicide!  Glenda is as pleased as punch to be relieved from defensive duties.  As the enemy bishop is only protected by the Witch then Glenda moving onto d4 is a double attack or fork.  As the king is in check, black must deal with that and the lsb must be abandoned to his fate leaving my opponent a whole rook down.} 26. Qd4+ e5 27. Qxd5 Qa4 28. fxe5+ Kg7 29. exd6 {29. exd6 - I now clean up a few of black's pawns.} bxa3 {29. ......... bxa3 - black tries some counterplay but to no avail as I now turn on my usual jstevens1 simplifying trick - forcing an exchange of queens as follows ......} 30. Qd4+ Qxd4 31. Rxd4 axb2+ 32. Kxb2 {32. Kxb2 - I am now a whole rook up in a rook and pawn ending.  Beginners - here is how you clean up your opponent who opts not to wave the white flag!} h5 33. Re7+ Rxe7 34. dxe7 Kf7 {34. ......... Kf7 - the final pair of rooks have been exchanged.  The black king tries to stop Glenda from making an appearance on e8 and indeed he does block it.  But never you fear, he will soon be in a zugzswang .....} 35. Re4 Ke8 36. gxh5 gxh5 37. c4 a5 38. c5 {38. c5 - isn't it nice to be spoilt for passers!  Zugzwang next move!} a4 39. c6 a3+ {39. ........a3  - Henry gleefully munches his prawn on toast as he surveys the squares c8 and e8.  Who knows, he may end up with two wives!  Don't forget that Henry the Eighth had 6 the greedy so and so!  The black king must now move after Kxa3 and then ..............} 40. Kxa3 Kf7 41. e8=Q+ {41. e8/Q  - a joyous fanfare greets the arrival of Glenda the Defender in all her splendour!  Glenda does not have defense in mind here though!  She too is not above chasing other queen's kings!} Kg7 42. Re6 {42. Re6 - thanks to her castle the deadly game of kiss chase does not last long.  The black king has only one legal move and that is to h7.  It is the castle that delivers the coup de grace on e8 and not Glenda though!  A happy ending for jstevens1!} Kh7 43. Qf7+ Kh8 44. Re8# {}
