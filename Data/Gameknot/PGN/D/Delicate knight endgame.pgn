1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Nimzo-Indian defence.} 4. Nf3 c5 5. g3 b6 6. Bg2 Bb7 {White and black struggle for control of the a8-h1 diagonal.} 7. Bd2 cxd4 8. Nb5 Be7 {Black stops the white knight coming to d6.} 9. O-O O-O 10. Bg5 a6 11. Nbxd4 {White gets back the pawn.} d5 12. Ne5 {This move opens the diagonal so that black can no longer play ...dxc4 (the bishop on b7 is hanging). } Nfd7 13. Nxd7 Nxd7 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Nc2 Nf6 16. Ne3 {White puts more pressure on the light squares d5 and c4.} dxc4 17. Bxb7 Qxb7 18. Nxc4 Rfd8 19. Qb3 b5 20. a4 Qd5 21. axb5 axb5 22. Na5 Qh5 {Black takes the queen to the kingside to exploit white's light square weakness there. Also the pawn on e2 is hanging.} 23. Qf3 {White offers a queen swap on f3 that will mess up the white pawns a tad - but it will dissipate black's  kingside attack and guard the g4 square. Also the queen eyes a8, hoping for some tactics there (maybe a back rank mate may be possible).} Ng4 24. h4 {h3 would be no good because of the simple reply ...Qxh3. (Thanks to ruachessnut2 for the note.)} g5 25. Nc6 {White wants to bring the knight over to pile pressure on g4.} Rxa1 26. Rxa1 Re8 27. Ne5 f5 28. Ra8 {Now things get complicated. Both sides have attacking chances.} Rxa8 29. Qxa8+ Kg7 30. Qa7+ {White is looking for a series of checks to create some magic.} Kf6 31. Nd7+ Ke7 32. f3 {White wants to chase the black night away so that e5 is undefended.} Nh6 33. Ne5+ Kf6 34. Qd4 gxh4 {Black's queen is horribly bottled up and wants some room.} 35. Ng4+ Ke7 36. Qf6+ Kd6 37. Qxh6 {After some hard work white goes ahead in material.} Qxh6 38. Nxh6 hxg3 {White is one pawn up in material - but black's king is much more actively placed (not to mention the two black passed pawns). The only way white can win is if the knight can perform miracles.} 39. e3 {Discouraging ...f4.} Kd5 40. Nf7 h5 41. Nd8 {Threatens e6 so the black king cant wander too far.} e5 42. Nb7 h4 43. Kg2 f4 44. e4+ {Fixes the black pawn at e5 where it will be a target. White wants some passed pawns too.} Kd4 45. Nd6 Ke3 46. Nf5+ {A lovely move.  46. Nxb5 looks attractive but will lose the game after ...h3   47. Kxh3 Kxf3, 48 Nc3 g2, 49 Ne2 Kxe2, 50 Kxg2 f3 ! 51 Kg3 and the black pawn queens.} Kd3 47. Nxh4 Kc2 48. Ng6 Kxb2 49. Nxf4 {And black resigns. ...exf4 is no good because of 50. e5 b4  51. e6 b3  51. e7 Kc2  52. e8/Q  b2  53. Qc6  etc. Neither is ...b4 any good. 50. Nd3  Kc3  51. Nxb4 Kxb4  52. Kxg3 etc. Also no good is ...Kc2  50. Nd5 and as soon as black plays ...b4 white takes it. Meanwhile white plays Kxg3, Kg4, Kf5 and Kxe5.}
