1. c4 e5 2. g3 {So far we have a Reversed Sicilian line of the English opening.} Nc6 {Stronger is probably 2. Nf6 leading to 3. Bg2 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5} 3. Bg2 d5 {It was simply too soon to play d5.  Instead, Nf6 prepares d5.} 4. cxd5 Nce7 {Most other knight moves lead to wasted time retreating the knight.} 5. Nc3 {I actually don't intend to hold onto the pawn, and yet I intend to make him work for it.} Nf6 6. e4 c6 7. Qb3 {Perhaps a queen defending a pawn is a touch rediculous, but I couldn't see an easy way for him to exploit her position!} cxd5 8. exd5 {I've accepted an isolated queen pawn position because I have made a surface study of Tarrasch-style positions.} Bd7 {I doubted the pawn capture was in my best interest.  Can it be soundly played?  8...b6 leads to 9.d6 forking rook and knight.} 9. Nge2 Ng6 10. d4 {I expect 10... exd4 11. Nxd4.  I still need to castle, but he has no viable strategy to keep my king in the center.} Bd6 {He blockades the pawn, a good idea in isolated queen pawn positions, but it will take him a little while to attack the blockaded pawn.  Bd7 still seems like a waste of time.  The more the b7 pawn is offered, the more I feel that he wants the counterplay and time I would have to use repositioning the queen.  I think Qxb7 is perfectly playable, but I know my nature as a chess player.  I could just as easily lose my queen as gain a solid two or three points heading towards a solid endgame.} 11. O-O {He has again offered the pawn on b7.  In addition, I can capture the pawn on e5.  Perhaps taking the relatively free material (e5) in exchange for a doubled pawn seems like a bargain, but I felt my King's safety as a higher priority.} b6 {If he was going to play this move, he should never have played Bd7.  Actually he should not have played Bd7 at all.  The f knight is vulnerable.  It needs to reposition before Bg5, but it has no great place to move.} 12. Bg5 {Now this is a common tactical move in Tarrasch style positions.  The pin can be brutal and the pinned must be really careful because the knight (c3 here) can often force a doubled f pawn.  The pin undermines black claims on e4 and strongly discourages the black knight from moving.} O-O 13. Ne4 Be7 {He didn't see this move coming and this is completely wrong.  Perhaps he never understood the goal of attacking d5?} 14. d6 {Now there are many interesting lines to contemplate.  The highlights of the position are as follows: The a8 rook will be lost if white gets to play NxN with tempo, black's dark-squared bishop will be lost one way or another, and white seems fine in the resulting play.  14...Bxd6? 15. Nxd6 exposing the black rook to white's LS bishop.  14... Nxe4 15. d6xe7 threatening queen and rook followed by 15... Qwhatever 16. exf8=Q  Q/Rxf8 17. Bxe4.  AND the line that follows:} Be6 {Threatening the queen seems hollow.  What if I accept?  Even if I lose the queen, a queen for a bishop and rook is very close to an equal exchange.  I can't say I actually worked it out.  It seemed to promise an interesting game, so I played it!} 15. dxe7 {And it's so easy to play those promised interesting lines when we feel we are winning, and I felt so!  It turns out that the interesting lines allow me at least a bishop up.} Bxb3 {I think he should have played either Qxe7, Nxe7, or just about anything.  After the exchange his pieces will lack any coordination.} 16. exd8=Q Rfxd8 {Yes, the knight is still pinned! -- or more accurately pinned again.} 17. axb3 {I'm up 6 points.  My position looks reasonable.  I'm probably going to trade down until we reach a very favorable end-game unless I find a promising attack.} exd4 {Interestingly he now has the isolated queen pawn!  I think I got all the advantage out of it though.  He had to avoid letting the d pawn take e pawn because the knight is still pinned.} 18. Nxf6+ {Inevitable.} gxf6 {The only move (figuratively).} 19. Bxf6 {I considered Bxa8, but I decided to let him decide which rook to keep.  After considering, he resigned.  Oddly enough letting the central rook be captured is most correct because he can recapture restoring it.}
