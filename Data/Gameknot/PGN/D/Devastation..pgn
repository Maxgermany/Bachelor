1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Bc4 Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Be3 Nc6 9. Qd2 Re8 {First move that is uncommon in this opening.  Black really doesn't gain much from it either.} 10. O-O-O a6 11. g4 Nxd4 {Strange move after moving the Rook from f8 to e8 there is no need to break up the Queen and bishop battery Ne5 would have been better in my opinion if black was planing b5.} 12. Bxd4 b5 13. Be2 {Bb3 the other option is played as well but I wanted to get my bishop out of the line of fire for now.} Be6 14. Kb1 Qc7 {beginning to build up on the c2 point.  The c3 knight is an illusion due to the advance b4.} 15. g5 {Forcing the trade of dark square bishops.} Nd7 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. h4 {The pawn storm will break though blacks pawns.} f6 18. h5 {total breakdown.} Bf7 {this move actually helps blacks position a bit. believe it or not.  Since now the exchange on g6 will result with the defense of the h7 point.} 19. gxf6+ {Starting the breakup.} exf6 20. hxg6 Bxg6 21. Rdg1 {keeping the bishop out of play.} Ne5 {? I think this is an error allows white to play f4 f5.} 22. Qh6+ {Getting the queen inside for the attack when I play f4 I don't want to be met with Nc4.} Kg8 23. f4 Nc4 24. f5 {winning the bishop.} Nd2+ {stopping the deadly Rxg6+ by diverting the queen from the action.} 25. Qxd2 Rac8 26. fxg6 {claiming the bishop.} Re7 {takes power away from gxh7+.} 27. Qd5+ Kh8 28. Qf5 {Giving a deadly threat.} b4 {?? black misses the treat. } 29. Qxf6+ {And the force mate begins.} Rg7 {Kg8 gxh7#} 30. Rxh7+ {only move is Kg8 now} Kg8 31. Rxg7+ {Forcing Qxg7} Qxg7 32. Qe6+ {The finisher.  Kh8 Rh1+ Qh7 Rxh7# Kf8 Qxc8+ Ke7 Nd5# Qf7 Qxf7+ Kh8 Rh1#}
