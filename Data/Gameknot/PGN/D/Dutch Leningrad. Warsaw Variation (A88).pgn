1. d4 f5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 g6 {going for the lennigrad} 4. c4 Bg7 5. Nc3 d6 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O {Main line of the Dutch..} c6 {Well, this is the warsaw variation. } 8. Rb1 {New theory from Kramnik...The idea being that in the Dutch leningrad, White has to watch out for the Bishop diagonal. E.g., 8. d5 e5; 9. e.p. dxe6 Bxe6; 10 b3. and Black has counter play. How is White suppose to protect his c4-pawn? I should note 10. Qd3 is played too.} Be6 {?} 9. d5 cxd5 10. cxd5 Bd7 11. Ng5 {The infamous Knight g5-e6 maneuver. } Na6 12. Ne6 Bxe6 13. dxe6 Rb8 14. e4 {I didn't know what else to play and I thought it open play....} fxe4 15. Nxe4 Nxe4 16. Bxe4 Nc5 17. Bd5 {protecting the e6-pawn} Rf5 {at least now I can play the move...} 18. b4 {Yes, ....It makes all the difference with that b1-rook instead of it being on a1.} Na6 19. Be3 {Again, this is why I played e4 first.....I didn't know what to do with my dark-squared Bishop. Hence, why I played e4 as I thought it looked funny in front of the Pawn as opposed to being "behind" the pawn...} Nc7 20. Bb3 Nb5 {? protecting a7?} 21. Rc1 a6 22. Qd2 d5 23. a4 Nc7 24. Bb6 Be5 25. Rfe1 {X-raying. Planning to capture Bishop on e5. After which RxR, and White would have a triple fork after Bishopxnc7!!} Bd6 26. f4 Rc8 27. Rc2 Qf8 28. Rec1 Qd8 {?......herein lies the problem for White: how is he going to tip the scale in his favor? I'm looking for that feather to lay down on the scale and have my opponent fall down...} 29. a5 {!! I was thinking boy...my bishop would cause a whole deal of trouble on d7.} Kf8 30. Ba4 Kg7 {??} 31. Bd7 Ra8 32. Rc2xc7 {! I foresaw the position and seen that my Rook wouldn't fair to well after the Bishop exchanges and Rook capture. Plus, I saw my dark-squared bishop was better on e5 attacking the King's fortress.} Bxc7 33. Bxc7 Qf8 34. Be5+ Kg8 35. Qxd5 Rh5 {I think black was afraid of g4.} 36. Qxb7 Rd8 37. Rc8 Rxc8 38. Qxc8 Qxc8 39. Bxc8 {and now I win by endgame } g5 40. Bxa6 gxf4 41. gxf4 Rh6 42. Bc4 Rg6+ 43. Kf2 h5 44. a6 {}
