1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {A Winawer variation of the French Defence.} 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 7. Nf3 b6 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bd3 Ba4 10. h4 h6 {White has settled for an anchored centre, but note the slightly tense nature on the queenside, where Black infiltrates with his a4-bishop.} 11. h5 Qc7 12. O-O Nd7 13. Re1 Qc6 14. Rb1 a6 15. Nd2 cxd4 16. cxd4 Bb5 {(!) Gulko recognised the potency that White could attack with using his bishops and queen. One variation is 16...0-0 17.Nb3 Rfc8 18.Qg4... Instead Black (in the face of a bishop swap off) can look forward to attacking the c-pawn after castling and mobilising his rooks.} 17. Rxb5 {(!) Topalov said he considered a sacrifice with 17.a4... After which 17...Bxa4 18.Ba3... Stops Black from castling else he face complications. He also said that he wouldn't mind 17...Bxd3 18.cxd3... Since Black is then unable to target c2. However, Topalov said he didn't sacrifice because after 17...Bxa4 18.Ba3 comes 18...Qc3! And threats of 19...Qxd3! And 19...Qxa3 arise. } axb5 18. Qe2 {The options for White's pieces, the threat on b5 and the fact that Black's rooks appear to be threatened from being able to mobilise compensate for the 'lost' material. However.....} Ra4 {(!) Gulko said 19.Bxb5 Qxc2 20.Bxa4 Qxa4 was acceptable for him.} 19. Nb3 {(!) Topalov refuses to accept the counter-sacrifice. But.....} Rc4 {(!) "No, I MUST insist...!" Black recognises the favourable stance after 20.Bxc4? bxc4} 20. Bd2 {Topalov intends to continue with Bb4 and c3. He can also exchange his weak b3-knight with Nb3-d2-xc4. } Nf5 21. Bb4 {(!) } Nxd4 22. Nxd4 Rxd4 23. Bxb5 Qc8 {White's bishops are the obvious asset of this position. However, Topalov pointed out that after 24.Bd6 Re4 25.Qd2 Rxe1+ and 26...Qxc2, that Black can regain composure with Qe4 or Kd8.} 24. Rd1 {(!) White recognises his attack would be winning after 24...Rxd1+ 25.Qxd1... And 26.c4...} Rxb4 {(!?) Black makes one more exchange sacrifice.} 25. axb4 Qc3 {This mini-combination intends to prevent the c-pawn from advancing.} 26. Qg4 {(!) White picks out the other target in Black's camp.} Qxe5 27. c4 {(!) The stretched nature of Black's stance is proven with this move. (27...Ke7 28.cxd5 Nf6 29.Qxg7 Rg8 30.d6+!...)} f5 28. Qg6+ Ke7 29. cxd5 exd5 {The Black pawns are isolated from one another, making the pawn structure fail.} 30. Bxd7 Kxd7 31. Qf7+ Kc8 32. Qa7 {Now the pawns are liable to being picked off one by one...} Re8 33. Rc1+ Kd8 34. Qb7 {1-0 One exchange sacrifice and two counter exchange sacrifices make this game one of my favourites. Hope you enjoyed!}
