[Opening "English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15)"]

1. c4 Nf6 2. g3 c6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Bg2 d5 5. b3 {White seeks to control the center from both flanks, while Black occupies it directly.} Bd6 6. Nc3 Nbd7 7. Bb2 O-O 8. O-O Ne5 9. d3 {It's been a quiet opening so far. Both sides are settling into position; White has a somewhat stronger LSB but it doesn't look like Black will have too much trouble freeing his.} Nfg4 {Black decides to turn the pressure up.} 10. Qc2 {Connecting the White Rooks.} Qf6 {Black applies more pressure to the Nf3, though he needs to be wary of a pin along a1-h8.} 11. Rab1 {White ensures his Bishop will be defended when his Queen leaves the second rank.} Qh6 {Threatening 12...Nxf3+ followed by 13...Qxh2#.} 12. h3 Nxf3+ 13. exf3 Nf6 14. Bc1 {With Black's Knight on f3, the Queen is looking very cramped and I'm wondering if I can win it by force (I can't).} Qg6 15. g4 {The BQ has no spaces to run; now I hope to slide a Knight around to f4 via e2 without Black noticing (Ne2, Bf4 Bxf4 Nxf4 and the Queen is lost).} b6 {Black prepares to let his LSB out.} 16. Ne2 Nd7 {Black is not fooled.} 17. Nf4 Qf6 18. Nh5 Qe7 19. Bb2 Bc7 {?! The intent here will become clear momentarily, but I don't think this sacrifice is sound.} 20. Bxg7 Qd6 {Threatening ...Qh2#.} 21. f4 {Not forced after all; thanks to gcah2006 for pointing out that 21.Rfe1 Qh2+ 22.Kf1 leaves Black with no more threats.} Re8 22. Bh6 {? This bishop belongs on the long diagonal, not this tiny corner. I am trying to press my advantage with a mating attack, but frankly I can't, and I don't need to. This Bishop should retreat to b2 and then I need to pull back my Knight and focus on defending my kingside. This move doesn't lose on its own, but it certainly is one big step along the road.} e5 23. Rfe1 {?? I tried to defend f4 in a clever way (not that it actually needed defending) and bring my Rook into the attack that I think I have going, since now if 23...exf4?? 24.Rxe8+! However, I missed Black's obvious threat, and now I will probably lose.} Qxh6 24. Qb2 {I'm badly behind and my pieces are disjointed. I'm looking to sneak a mate on g7 now, while I try to consolidate.} Ba6 {Connecting the Black Rooks in preparation for opening the e-file.} 25. Re2 exf4 26. Rbe1 Rxe2 27. Rxe2 Qg5 28. Re7 {? Inaccurate, but I'm running out of options, and I want to bait the BQ away from her defense of g7. 28.cxd5 was probably better (28...cxd5 29.Bxd5 and at least I have a pawn and a slight initiative).} Be5 {! Black takes control of a1-h8, and my hopes are dashed.} 29. Rxe5 Qxe5 30. d4 {Not great, but I certainly can't afford to trade Queens. The game is lost at this point, so I won't make many further comments, but we played it to the end, and the mating attack is very elegant.} Qe1+ 31. Kh2 Re8 32. Nxf4 dxc4 33. Bxc6 c3 34. Qc2 Qd2 35. Qf5 Qxf2+ 36. Bg2 Nf8 37. Qg5+ Ng6 38. Nh5 {I'm hoping for 38...Re2? and a draw by perpetual check with 39.Qd8+ Nf8 40.Qg5+ etc.} Re6 {But Black, as usual, spots my tricks and shuts me down.} 39. Qd8+ Nf8 40. Qg5+ Rg6 41. Qe5 c2 42. Qc7 Bf1 43. Nf4 Bxg2 {! It is over.} 44. Nd3 Qd2 45. Ne5 Bd5+ 46. Kg3 c1=Q 47. Qxc1 Qxc1 48. Nxg6 Nxg6 49. Kf2 Qd2+ 50. Kg3 Qe3+ 51. Kh2 Qf2# {Thanks again to janek66 for the game! This game was mine to lose, I think, and lose it I did. A little patience would have gone a long way for me here, but I chose Total War, and it really didn't work out for me ;)  Comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated. If you leave a rating, please also comment letting me know what you liked or what I can improve on. Thanks for reading!}
