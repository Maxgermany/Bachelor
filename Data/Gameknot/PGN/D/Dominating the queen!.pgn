[Opening "Queen's pawn game (E00)"]

1. d4 {After a long slump, my rating has finally crossed the 1700 line again, with the final push coming from this game in the 77th GK Tournament -- a brevity ending with an unusual domination of the queen. My opponent, sokolskyb4, does *not* begin with the opening named after him (which was a comfort, as I find it difficult to play against....)} Nf6 2. c4 e6 {Instead, we play the first moves of a Nimzo-Indian. White must now choose whether to enter the Nimzo with 3. Nc3 or to avoid it.} 3. a3 {White chooses the Australian Attack. (Not to be confused with the Austrian Attack in the Pirc Defence....) If the move is intended solely to prevent the Nimzo, it seems a waste of time, since 3. Nf3 would achieve this while also developing; but probably (given the word "Attack" in the opening's name) it is normally played with the intention of queenside expansion. Nevertheless, a much rarer choice than Nf3; BCO2 does not consider it at all.} b6 {I'm not sure what Black normally plays in this opening, so I try to take the game into lines I'm more familiar with -- a Queen's Indian, Petrosian Variation.} 4. Nc3 {White normally develops the other knight first, though I can't say I know why.} d5 5. Qc2 {And this is definitely not in book; 5. Nf3 is usual, after which 5... Bb7 returns us to known lines. The move played prepares to establish a pawn on e4, but it has a downside: the queen is no longer defending d4.} dxc4 6. Nf3 Nc6 {(!?) Black increases the attack on d4, forcing White to play e3 rather than e4. I'm still not sure about this move, since it blocks the (back) c-pawn; my original plan was to slip in this move before playing Ba6 to hold the c4 pawn, but then I saw that this is refuted by Qa4 forking the pieces.} 7. e3 Bb7 {So, I let the pawn go and continue with development, hoping to make something of the fact that White's QB is blocked, and he is a little behind on development thanks to his Q move.} 8. Bxc4 Bd6 {I felt the bishop would be too passive on e7.} 9. Bd2 O-O 10. Nb5 {(?!) White decides to gain the bishop pair, but at the cost of time.} a6 11. Nxd6 cxd6 12. O-O-O {(?) Up to now, Black looks to be slightly better, but after 12. 0-0 a long and difficult middlegame would be in prospect as Black tries to make something of that advantage. But castling into the broken queenside just gives Black an immediate and obvious line of attack.} Rc8 {No marks for subtlety. Black threatens to win a piece at once with 13... b5.} 13. Bc3 {Frère Leblanc is tiring of his guard duties, so Frère Lenoir hastens to take his place.} b5 14. Ba2 {(?) The wrong way! After 14. Bd3! White has a much better chance of holding the position together. Firstly, 14... a5 can't be played at once, as the b5 pawn would hang; secondly, the b1-h7 diagonal would be covered. Why is that so important? Read on and find out!} a5 15. Kb1 {In order that the bishop can retreat without QN-any leaving the queen pinned. Since White cannot in fact avoid loss of material, the best play would really just be to abandon the bishop -- though White then faces an unpleasant middlegame a piece down with his king still exposed.} b4 16. axb4 axb4 17. Bd2 {After 17. Be1 Black has 17... Nxd4 18. Qd2 Nxf3 19. gxf3 Bxf3 winning two pawns and the exchange (thanks to the fork of the rooks). After the move played, the same line is available, but Black sees something even better...} Nxd4 {...the win of the White queen! In open play, with 14 legal moves available to her, she has no safe squares. The one line that may need spelling out in detail is 18. Qa4 Ra8 and White must lose the queen, since 19. Qxb4 allows Be4+ 20. Kc1 Ne2# or 20. Ka1 Nc2+ 21. Kb1 Nxb4+ 22. Ka1 Rxa2# (22. Kc1 Nxa2#).} 18. Qd3 {White chooses this move instead and resigns immediately after Black's reply.} Be4 {Just a small final note -- aesthetically, I like the fact that the f6 knight also has a small but important role in the combination.}
