1. e4 c5 2. c3 Nf6 {I don't "know" the book on the c3 Sicilian, though I have read Chandler's book on it.  I haven't done too well recently with 2....d5 so reverted to 2....Nf6} 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 cxd4 {I'm not sure about this.  At one time I used to resist exchanging on d4 when White had played c3 but recently I've tended to play this, allowing White to set up his pawn centre.} 5. cxd4 e6 6. Nf3 h6 {I'm not quite sure why I played this.  It may have been worries about castling into an attack on h7.  I think there were more urgent moves to be made though: ...Be7 or ...Bb4+, ...Nc6 or ...d6.} 7. a3 {White responds with something equally anodyne.} Be7 8. Nc3 Nxc3 {I reasoned that this was better than allowing doubled d-pawns and half-opening the e-file.} 9. bxc3 d5 10. exd6 e.p. Qxd6 {A show of confidence... White has 3 pawn islands to Black's 2 and no immediate way of attacking the Q} 11. Bd3 Nd7 {Black hastens to bolster his kingside before castling.} 12. O-O O-O 13. Qe2 {Slightly mysterious, so good.} Nf6 14. Ne5 Bd7 {I don't normally invite my opponent to swap N for B but in this case his N was far better than my B and if he didn't swap, I had plans for the B.  Regardless, I had to develop.} 15. g4 {?! An unexpected and rash-looking advance, opening up White's king more than Black's.  I'm quite fond of a similar advance (at an earlier stage) in the Caro Kann Advance, though.} Rac8 {I stuck to opening principles, developing another piece and attacking the weakling on c3.} 16. Bd2 {White defends the c3 pawn.} Bc6 {Hoping to set up an assault on White's K with ...Qd5.  White now sank into deep thought, emerging about 30 minutes later with the entirely predictable} 17. Nxc6 Rxc6 18. Qf3 {This was less predictable though and caused me to invest about 15 minutes ...} Nh7 19. Bf4 {For some reason, I hadn't predicted this response.} Ng5 {and I suspect neither had White expected this response to the threat on my Q, though it is the logical follow up to Black's last move..} 20. Bxg5 Bxg5 21. Qe4 {White gets in his attack on h7 after all.} f5 22. gxf5 exf5 23. Qe1 {Good retreat.} Qg6 24. Kh1 Qh5 {This sequence seemed to play itself} 25. f4 Bh4 26. Qd2 Re8 {?? missing the forthcoming skewer.  26...Rg6 was the other move I'd considered and would have been better.} 27. Bb5 {! My heart sank.} Bg3 28. Ra2 {! This frees White's Q from defending h2} Be1 29. Qg2 Rce6 {I now ran out of counter-attacking ideas that would delay White's winning of the exchange.} 30. Bxe8 {White cashed in immediately.} Rxe8 31. Qxb7 {This may look like pawn grabbing but there is a stronger motivation for it.} Qh3 32. Rg1 {White threatens mate in 1.} Bg3 33. Rag2 {and, faced with inevitable catastrophic loss of material or mate, I resigned.}
