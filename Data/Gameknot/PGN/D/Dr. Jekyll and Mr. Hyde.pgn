[Opening "French (C00), Steinitz attack"]

1. e4 e6 {Now this makes me chuckle. I know it is the beginning of the French defense, which many grandmasters do play, but I don't like it. Just because, I often move an early e5 to give black fits and take him out of any ideas of a traditional French. Yes, it loses a tempo and is probably unsound. But it's fun, and to me, that is what chess is. Fun!} 2. e5 {So I do this.} d6 3. exd6 {And exchange it off. Black now has a lead in development, and white has gained nothing, except that black is no longer just playing 'book' French Defense moves.} Bxd6 4. Bb5+ {This is another waste of time by white. But my intention here is to provoke c6. You see, here is the fun in what I just did: black ought to play aggressively now and continue to do so. But someone who favors a certain style of play can't easily switch gears... yet... if I'm playing a really highly rated player, I don't play like this. There's no getting away with such games then!} c6 {Black obliges. I've given him every opportunity to play much more aggressively, and still he favors the stolid type opening. But... stay tuned.} 5. Ba4 {What will black do now?} b5 {Aha! Now he's playing a bit more aggressively. Okay then, time for fun.} 6. Bb3 a5 {Black continues aggresive play. Now, here I decide to play a4.} 7. a4 b4 8. c3 {I really don't like my queenside now, but just wait: it gets far worse. Dr. Jekyll is fully taking advantage of my laisse faire attitude about those pawns. This last move of mine was due to that careless attitude.} Nf6 9. Nf3 h6 10. O-O O-O {Just normal development, the last few moves.} 11. d4 {And white's position, frankly, sucks.} Bb7 12. c4 {I make it worse, because I'm not ready to do what I just did.} c5 {Here I thought about taking the c pawn, but did not like the scope those black bishops would have if I did. But unfortunately, I did not think past that thought, and white really now already is lost. But wait, I'm not just playing Dr. Jekyll. Mr Hyde will soon show.} 13. d5 {So I even make it worse yet. And Dr. Jekyll is not missing anything just now.} exd5 14. cxd5 Ba6 {Again I was not thinking beyond the obvious. Duh. Rook attacked. Move rook. } 15. Re1 c4 {Bam! now white is in a real bind.} 16. Bc2 Bb7 {Now here black opted not to advance the b pawn, he has something else in mind, and I am paying no mind to the machinations of one Dr. Jekyll. So far my opponent has played very well, demonstrating a good grasp of strategy, while I've played simply awful.} 17. b3 {This was rather stupid.} c3 {Suddenly half of my army is cut off from play by my poor play, and Dr. Jekyll's taking the opportunities I just granted him. Now this guy was rated 1650, and although I have defeated players rated above 2300 (well and lost to those also), he's just plain kicking my posterior. In this rather sad position, I realize I will lose this game without a major shift on my part.} 18. Bxh6 {So why not, I thought. This game is lost, Dr. Jekyll has seen to it... but wait a minute, Dr. Jekyll is no where to be found, of a sudden. Instead, there is naught but a hideous noise now as Mr. Hyde suddenly sits on the other side of the board.} Ng4 {Well HECK I thought. I was throwing the bishop away for a chance at some counterplay. Seriously outmanned, outpositioned, and just crushed on the queenside, this move astounds me. So I give further instructions to the bishop. "Continue", I said, "excommunicating the King's knaves". The bishop complies, as most are wont to be obedient...} 19. Bxg7 {And now the King finally decides this rogue bishop must die.} Kxg7 20. Qd4+ {The tunnel is still dark, any light is likely an oncoming train. But I am not willing to just give up despite my earlier horrendous play. Turns out Mr. Hyde is about to lose in great style here.} Nf6 21. Qh4 {Suddenly the Black King is very uncomfortable, despite a major part of my army having a tea party in the corner of the board.} Rh8 22. Qg5+ {Another fruitless check, but what else does white have? Nothing. Oh wait, that's right. Mr. Hyde is playing...} Kf8 23. h3 {A nod to the pressure on the white King. Mr. Hyde now begins to make moves I don't understand. Nearly everyone would see that trading of pieces in this position would result in a won endgame for black, as not only am I down a piece, I will likely lose another piece just to liberate the queenside pieces that Dr. Jekyll so neatly imprisoned in a very strong dungeon.} Bxd5 {But inexplicably, Mr. Hyde gives in to his animal nature. "Pawn. Must grab pawn". And so he does.} 24. Nd4 {All kinds of black tactics are available, but Dr. Jekyll is no where in sight. This is my most embarrassing game I've played, including the blitz games I've lost to others. It's hilarious! When you play like I have in this game, you realize: it's time to go to bed, and give it a rest. But I couldn't resist annotating this one. The entertainment continues...} Nbd7 {Inexplicably, black decides he needs further help. Let's see; I'm assaulting the black king with two pieces, and there are six swarming to it's defense. Oh, wait, I miscounted: the Rook has the e file. } 25. Nf5 {I really didn't think this was going anywhere, but about this point I realize that black's king really is in a little trouble. Now. Thanks to Mr. Hyde's reluctance to trade queens. A softspot for a pretty lady has been many a downfall for us guys, hasn't it.} Bh2+ {Black does this, but for the life of me I can't figure out why.} 26. Kxh2 Qc7+ 27. Kg1 {So I can understand a reluctance to trade queens I suppose. There is, after all, something to be said for holding onto one's firepower. But here white's king still has ample protection for the time being, despite the ponderous pressure heading that way. Meanwhile, I practically jump at the chance to get back in the game...} Be6 {This move was probably necessary, but it's far too slow for the position. I understand it; cutting the rook off from the e file. Black should have seen to his defense a lot sooner, and now it's too late. There is lousy chess, like I played for most of the first part of this game, and good chess, such as Dr. Jekyll played. And then there's the total wreck Mr. Hyde is inflicting on himself. There's a reason Dr. Jekyll is the one that should do the chess playing!} 28. Qg7+ Ke8 {Forced.} 29. Qxh8+ Nf8 {Also forced, pretty much.} 30. Qxf6 {I am now winning, since Dr. Jekyll retired. Mr Hyde ensures such to be the case with his next move:} Nh7 {Nh7? Perhaps it deserves two ?'s. Mr. Hyde is reluctant to leave his pawn, thinking falsely that it will protect him. And this last move results in at least massive material loss for black. Even Dr. Jekyll could not fix Mr. Hyde's position now.} 31. Ng7+ {There are only two available moves. One leads to a mate in four: Kf8. The other, Kd7 is not much better.} Kf8 {Kf8?? And Mr Hyde has undone all of Dr. Jekyll's fine work. The simple tactical shot wins...} 32. Nxe6+ {Now the mate is in three, and it's a nice one. ( ...Ke8 Nf8!+ Kxf8 Qh8#) Even novice players will notice if the mate is missed, that besides the fork of the black queen, to add insult to injury, yet another fork after on the rook exists too. Thus Mr. Hyde recognized that it was curtains for him, and stomps off in a rage. I certainly learned one thing from this: not to take pawn advances so carelessly just because my opponent doesn't seem all that highly rated. I'll probably still play nearly anything to avoid obvious book lines, because I'm lazy, don't want to memorize a lot of openings, and enjoy odd positions. But when you do that, take it from me: sometimes you'll face Dr. Jekyll, not always Mr. Hyde.}
