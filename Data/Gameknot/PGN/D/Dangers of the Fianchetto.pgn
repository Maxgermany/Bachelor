1. e4 {This very short, simple, and brilliant game is very interesting and teaches us many simple, but vastly important lessons.  Gioachino Greco was one of the earliest chess experts.  This game took place around 1619, almost four centuries ago.  Greco considered this one of his best games.  It is very short and has no need for intense calculation, but rather shows how being greedy and forcing the position can be a big mistake, especially in a fianchetto position.  Greco starts with the familiar e4.} b6 {The Queen's Fianchetto opening.  This move shows Black is willing to give up most direct control of the center.  This is quite dangerous for inexperienced players as we will see later on, white will attack Black's king quickly and one false move could end the game.  Black must try to meet the threat on his king while still attacking White.    To players that are unfamiliar to the Queen's Fianchetto opening, it may seem weird just how many of these moves are considered "book".  But, more on that later.  Also, please note the difference between the Queen's Fianchetto opening and a fianchetto position.  Fianchettos are great, solid positions even for a castled king.  However, starting the game by playing a fianchetto and not developing the center first is a bit more dangerous than developing the center pawns and a knight or two first.} 2. d4 {White is happy to dominate the center.  This is probably the most tradition and natural move.    This brings up an interesting point.  If your opponent ever plays a move you are unfamiliar with, or that is a bit unorthodox, you should just continue normally after accessing any possible threats.  Sometimes your opponent is just hoping to throw you off your game with an unfamiliar move.    Do as Greco did, and just play normally.} Bb7 {This is where the fianchetto actually comes in.  The bishop is attacking the longest light-squared diagonal on the board.  One note is it may be positionally better to fianchetto after getting at least some center developement.  Also, once the pawn move is played, moving the bishop to the fianchetto position is a must.  You need to finish the combination quickly.} 3. Bd3 {Greco always preferred his bishop on d3 rather than c4 or b5.  This was obviously a good choice as we will see later on. } f5 {This move is still considered "book".  In fact, these types of openings were very popular in the hypermodern movement of the late 1900's.  One of the movement's ideas was that occupying the center was not a necessity.  It is very interesting that a game played 400 years ago used an opening very popular now.  Here Black offers a pawn to break up White's center.  Also, avoiding direct contact, Black still contests the center.} 4. exf5 {White takes the pawn but breaks up the center.  A fine move.  White still has a very good position.} Bxg2 {We're still in book!  You might be thinking, "Wow!  The rook on h1 is gone!"  But then again, if this is considered book, it obviously isn't as we will soon see.} 5. Qh5+ {Notice how the king is almost completely smothered by his own pieces.  This makes him very easy to take down.  Pretend the g7 pawn isn't there.  The game would be over.  It would be checkmate.  That one pawn holds the balance of the game.  This is the danger and thrill of playing the Queen's Fianchetto, as well as the main theme of the game.} g6 {The only possible move!} 6. fxg6 {This is the last move played in the game considered "book".  Generally Black would develop his Bishop to give the king breathing room at f8.  } Nf6 {Nf6???  This is Black's only flaw in the entire game, but it was enough to cost him the game.  He got greedy.  He saw the Queen and went after it.  But why is this such a bad move?  Think about it for a moment.  There's actually a force mate in two for white now!  If you found it, fantastic!  If not we'll walk though it.   Hint:  A very powerful way to force a mate is by sacrificing material, more specifically in this case, a queen!} 7. gxh7+ {Gxh7 !!!  What a bizarre looking move, but it does the trick.  White offers the queen for "free".  In fact Black's only move is Nxh5 taking the queen!} Nxh5 {Can you find mate in one for white?  Hint:  It's the only way to even check the Black king!} 8. Bg6# {Bg6#!  Even after 400 years some games can still make one smile!  The king was taken down by a lone bishop!    This is why not developing the center can be very dangerous.  The Queen's Fianchetto is a fine opening, if played correctly.  If you are going to play the Queen's Fianchetto, please use extreme caution and watch for the danger of the fianchetto!  :)}
