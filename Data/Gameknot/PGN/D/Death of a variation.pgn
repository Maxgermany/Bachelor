1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 {Book so far.} exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. f4 Bg7 {So far, so good.} 8. e5 {This constitutes the Mikenas Pawn Storm. Until this game, it was *thought* to be a promising line for White.} Nfd7 {Avoiding PxP, which gives White a powerful attack.} 9. Nb5 dxe5 10. Nd6+ {White presses forward in this variation, trying to keep Black's game disorganized. But Holm has a riposte up his sleeve.} Ke7 11. Nxc8+ Qxc8 12. d6+ Kf8 13. Nf3 {All standard for the Mikenas Pawn Storm, so far. But...} e4 {Holm's brilliant counter. Partos will find it very hard after this to find a safe haven for his King. This is the move that breaks the variation's back.} 14. Ng5 h6 15. Nxe4 Qe8 {Pinning the Knight and forcing Partos to block the development of his KB.} 16. Qe2 Nc6 17. Kf2 {Partos must unpin. Otherwise he loses a piece.} Bd4+ 18. Kg3 Kg7 {Holm places his own King in relative safety, while Partos' monarch is exposed.} 19. Nc3 Qf8 20. h3 a6 21. Qf3 Qxd6 {Another pin by Holm. Partos is in a very perilous position.} 22. Kh2 Nf6 23. Bd3 Rhe8 {Holm's attack is gathering force.} 24. Rd1 Rad8 25. Kh1 {Partos has no good moves. Now Holm secures a decisive material advantage.} Bxc3 26. bxc3 c4 27. Bc2 Qxd1+ {The decisive blow.} 28. Bxd1 Re1+ 29. Kh2 Rdxd1 {The attack is brilliantly conducted.} 30. g4 Rdxc1 31. Rxc1 Rxc1 {The smoke of battle has cleared, and Holm's material advantage is decisive. "Resigns" would probably be Partos's best alternative, but he drags the game out for a bit longer.} 32. Qe2 Rxc3 33. Qb2 Nd5 34. Qxb7 Nce7 35. Qxa6 Nxf4 36. Qd6 Rxh3+ 37. Kg1 Ned5 38. Qe5+ f6 39. Qd6 Re3 40. a4 c3 41. Qc5 Re1+ 42. Kh2 c2 {Partos finally throws in the towel. If 43 QxP, 43... R-K7ch wins the Queen. The Mikenas Pawn Storm lies dead and buried.}
