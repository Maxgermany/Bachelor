1. e4 {This game was perhaps not the most exciting from an artistic point of view, but there was a lot of tension and fighting spirit. The quality of play was higher than in most of my games, with no side making any serious mistake.} c5 2. Nf3 g6 {The accelerated dragon is understandably very popular nowadays.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Bg7 5. Nc3 {5.c4, heading for a Maroczy bind is also an interesting try. White has good practical results with that approach.} Nc6 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bc4 {The bishop is a little exposed on this diagonal, but it prevents black's d5 push for the moment. For instance, 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d5! is unpleasant for white.} O-O 8. Bb3 {Nxe4, with equality, was threatened.} d6 9. h3 {To counter the threat of Ng4, white had to play either f3 or h3. Entering the Yugoslav attack with 9.f3 is probably the most critical, but it can be very painful to play white, at least in a game with less time on your clock. I used to think this h3 move was a good practical choice, but after some games, including this one, I've changed my mind. Now I believe the Maroczy bind is a better practical choice against the accelerated dragon if you want to avoid the complications of the Yugoslav attack.} Na5 10. O-O b6 {Both players go for the most principled continuations. White players are having difficulties with this black setup.} 11. Re1 Bb7 12. Bg5 Nxb3 13. axb3 h6 14. Bxf6 {A novelty which I had analyzed extensively beforehand. It doesn't look natural at all to give away this bishop, but there is some logic behind the move. Eliminating the f6 knight takes away some pressure from e4. White had to depart with his last bishop, but it would have been badly placed anyway. Now he is hoping to use the extra tempo to start an attack on the queenside. He is also trying to prove the claim that two well placed knights in the centre can be just as strong as the two bishops.} Bxf6 15. Qd3 Bg7 16. b4 {White has a clear plan with b5 followed by doubling the rooks on the a-file. Thus black has only one move to prevent a serious white advantage.} a6 17. h4 {White is using his pawns as spearheads in a desperate try to create weaknesses in the black camp.} e6 {The black position is now so solid that he can play this move without having to fear for his d6 pawn. His queen will now enter on the kingside.} 18. h5 Qh4 {!  I was naively expecting gxh5 when white has at least managed to create some targets. It is gradually becoming clear that white has to fight for survival.} 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. Nf3 Qf4 21. Rad1 Rad8 22. Re3 g5 {h5 was also interesting.} 23. Qe2 g4 24. Nd4 Rde8 25. g3 {Further weakening the kingside, but it was very hard to defend with the enemy queen on f4.} Qg5 26. b5 axb5 27. Qxb5 {A knight capture on b5 would have been problematic after Ba6.} Be5 28. Re2 {On 28.f4 gxf3 29.Rxf3 Bxe4! was a killer. Now white is pretending to threaten it, but it's unclear if such a loose move is ever good.} Qg6 29. Qb4 {It was possible to capture on b6. Black doesn't really care, since he has a serious attack on the kingside and the white pawns are going nowhere. Still, it might have been objectively best.} Qf6 30. Qxb6 {Why take this pawn now, you might ask, but white has few sensible moves anyway.} Rf7 {30...Rb8 looked good, but after 31.Ndb5! Bxe4 32.Nxe4 Rxb6 33.Nxf6  the endgame is drawish.} 31. Ndb5 {White has achieved something. Now he is starting to make threats himself.} Rc8 32. Qe3 {I only briefly considered 32.Nxd6 because of the reply 32...Rc6, but analysis with a computer revealed that black has nothing better than a draw. 33.Qb4 Rxd6 34.Rxd6 Bxg3!! (anything else loses), for instance 35.Rdd2 Qh4 36.fxg3 Qxg3  with perpetual check!  At first I thought 32.Rxd6 was promising, but then I found 32...Bxd6 33.Nxd6 Rc6 34.Qb4 Ra6! and didn't need to see more.} Rd7 33. Red2 Rcd8 34. Qb6 Qf8 35. Nd4 Qf7 36. Qb3 {It is noteworthy that both Rybka and Fritz think white is significantly better here, when in fact he is struggling for a draw. After having easily parried white's temporary threats, black is now intending to push h5-h4 with a decisive kingside attack. I think I managed to find the only way to save the position.} Re8 37. Qc4 h5 38. Qe2 {!  Currently hindering h4, which was the point of the queen maneuvre.} Qg6 39. Ndb5 Red8 40. Qe3 Qf6 {Black has found a very nice way of opening up the a8-h1 diagonal.} 41. Na3 d5 42. exd5 exd5 43. Nc4 d4 44. Qxe5 {I had to go for this and hope for the best.} Qf3 45. Qg5+ Kh8 {At first it looked like black would win brilliantly with 45...Rg7 46.Qxd8  Kh7, but white has the resource 47.Nd5! Bxd5 48.Qxd5!! with an unclear position.} 46. Qxh5+ Rh7 47. Qe5+ Rg7 {This is the best try, because now the white king has to take a walk. The position takes on a forced character. Both sides managed to find the best moves.} 48. Kf1 Qh1+ 49. Ke2 Bf3+ 50. Kd3 Bxd1 51. Qf6 {!  An important intermezzo. 51.Nxd1 Qf3  was losing on the spot.} Qf1+ 52. Ne2 Re8 53. Ne5 Kg8 54. Qd6 Qxf2 55. Qd5+ Kh8 56. Nxd4 Qxg3+ 57. Nef3 {Fortunately this opens up for a check on h5.} Rh7 {At this point the game was drawn more or less from mutual respect. Play might continue 58.Rxd1 gxf3 59.Nxf3. The white king will flee to the kingside and there are no real winning chances for either side.}
