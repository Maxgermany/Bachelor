1. d4 {Here is a good one that shows that even the mighty can be CRUSHED! In this QGD, Tarrasch unleashes a double bishop sacrifice that forces Nimzo's king to make a humiliating walk all the way up the board. I hope you enjoy:)   PS - from Wikepedia: [edit] Original Grandmasters (1914) The title "Grandmaster" was first formally conferred by Russian Tsar Nicholas II, who in 1914 awarded it to five players (Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch and Marshall), who were finalists of a tournament in Saint Petersburg which he had partially funded. The tournament was won by Lasker ahead of Capablanca.   [edit] Non-standard usage (1914–1950) After 1914, the term "Grandmaster" was sometimes informally applied to other world class players.  In the early 1930s, the Soviet Union brought in the title of "Grandmaster of the USSR", for their own players, since at that time Soviets were not competing outside their own country.   [edit] Official Status (1950 onwards) FIDE first awarded the Grandmaster title in 1950 to 27 players. These players were:  The top players of the day: world champion Botvinnik, and those who had qualified for (or been seeded into) the inaugural Candidates Tournament in 1950: Boleslavsky, Bondarevsky, Bronstein, Euwe, Fine, Flohr, Keres, Kotov, Lilienthal, Najdorf, Reshevsky, Smyslov, Ståhlberg, and Szabó.  Players still living who, though past their best in 1950, were recognised as having been world class when at their peak: Bernstein, Duras, Grünfeld, Kostić, Levenfish, Maroczy, Mieses, Ragozin, Rubinstein, Sämisch, Tartakower, and Vidmar.  By recognising world class players before 1950, this gave continuity with the original 1914 Grandmasters, except for world class players who had died between 1914 and 1950 (such as Carl Schlechter, Richard Reti and Aron Nimzowitsch).  Since 1950, players have had to qualify for the Grandmaster title according to FIDE rules.  Certainly Nimzo would have received the "official" title had he lived.} d5 2. Nf3 c5 {The characteristic move of the Tarrasch Defense. Named for the player, this type of defense many times leads to black having an isolated d pawn but very active piece play.} 3. c4 {And white heads immediately into Queen's Gambit territory.} e6 {Black plays for QGD lines.} 4. e3 Nf6 5. Bd3 {?! A little risky, as 5...dxc 6. Bxc loses tempo for white.} Nc6 {It's interesting to note that if black had played 5...dxc 6. Bxc Nc6, the main line of the QGA would now be reached, but with black having an extra tempo.} 6. O-O Bd6 7. b3 O-O 8. Bb2 b6 {Both sides seem content (for now) to just follow a symmetrical development plan.} 9. Nbd2 {As a 1. d4 player myself, I learned a valuable lesson here. The developing move Nbd2 appears sound and logical, but perhaps it was better to develop this knight to c3 instead, as black's d pawn seriously constricts it on d2.} Bb7 10. Rc1 {Shoring up the c file which may very well be opened soon.} Qe7 {Connecting the rooks and preparing for play down the e file.} 11. cxd5 {?! Not really an ideal continuation after Nbd2. White will still have the restrictive black pawn on d5 to deal with. I can only assume that Nimzo was hoping to rip open the c file and play Qc2 next (which is fairly common in QG positions, as it threatens play on black's h pawn).} exd5 12. Nh4 {?! An obvious lure of black's g pawn, as the white bishop on b2 can be activated after white plays dxc. This just seems a little slow, however, and loses tempo. Maybe 12. dxc bxc 13. BxN QxB 14. e4 was a stronger continuation.} g6 13. Nhf3 Rad8 14. dxc5 bxc5 15. Bb5 {As black has played g6, white's light squared bishop has lost some of it's zip.} Ne4 {A very natural post for this knight to occupy.} 16. Bxc6 {?! I'm sure Nimzo would roll over in his grave if he knew that some 1500 rated internet junkie was putting all of the "?!'s" next to his moves, but I just didn't get this one. Why give Black the very active bishop pair here? What's wrong with Qc2 or Qe2?} Bxc6 17. Qc2 Nxd2 {Tarrasch practically forces white to take back with NxN to avoid tempo loss and control of the b1/h7 diagonal.} 18. Nxd2 d4 {! Black's c6 bishop is now in the game, and Tarrasch begins forming sacrifice plans on Nimzo's castled position.} 19. exd4 Bxh2+ {! Game on! Tarrasch starts stripping away white's defenses.} 20. Kxh2 Qh4+ 21. Kg1 Bxg2 {! Bam! Once again, black offers a bishop sac. } 22. f3 {Definitely best - just work this out: 22. Kxg Qg4  23. Kh1 Rd5 24. Qxc Qh5  25. Kg1 Qg5  26. Kh1 RxQ. Nimzo is creating an escape square for his king because he knows that he is in a boatload of trouble.} Rfe8 {Black is now fully activated and preparing to deliver the death blow.} 23. Ne4 {Go back to white's 9th move. Another unforseen liability of that move was that it would restrict the white queen along the second rank. Nimzo clears this obstacle now, but it is WAAAAY too late.} Qh1+ 24. Kf2 Bxf1 {! A simple but effective tactic. If white plays 25. RxB then black responds 25...Qh2  and wins the white queen.} 25. d5 {White finally tries to get the play along the dark diagonal he was shooting for when he played the dubious 12. Nh4.} f5 {25... Qg2  26. Ke1 Qxf was just as effective.} 26. Qc3 {White gets his only threat of the game, looking to mate on g7. However, black has a very nice practically forced win in a few more moves.} Qg2+ 27. Ke3 Rxe4+ {! Obviously black can't allow white the time to attack, so he strikes first.} 28. fxe4 f4+ {In researching this game, I discovered two things - 1) These two guys didn't really care for each other (at all - it sounded to me like they really hated each other in my readings) and 2) Tarrasch actually had a quicker forced mate with 28... Qg3  29. Kd2 Qf2  30. Kd1 Qe2#. Perhaps Tarrasch's dislike of Nimzowitsch compelled him to play for this more humiliating mate.} 29. Kxf4 Rf8+ 30. Ke5 Qh2+ 31. Ke6 Re8+ 32. Kd7 Bb5# {Ouch! That was just WRONG! (but oooh so RIGHT!) I discovered that Nimzowitsch had a lifetime edge of  5=5-2 against Tarrasch, but for Dr. Tarrasch, I'm sure that a vindictive mate such as this went a long way to soothing his ego. I hope you enjoyed the game:) - Thomas}
