1. e4 {I've decided to annotate this game because it shows a very common mistake made by people in the Italian Opening. It also shows why you should not play the two knights variation(shown in this game) of the Italian Opening, unless you know how to properly play it.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {The Italian Opening} Nf6 {The main line of the Ilalian opening is Bc5, where play continues c3 Nf6 d4 exd4 etc. While the two knights variation is fine to play, if you don't know how to play it, you can lose very easily.} 4. Ng5 {attacking f7} d5 {the safest way to stave off the attack} 5. exd5 Nxd5 {?! The first mistake, much better would be Na5, forcing the bishop to move and only later recapturing the pawn. As shown in this game, capturing immediately leaves you in a bad position after a few moves.} 6. d4 {the idea of this move is to open up the Queen for a double attack on the d5 knight.} Nxd4 {The second mistake, much better is Bg4, if you must capture the pawn, even exd4 is better, as now White gets a decisive attack.} 7. c3 {If the Knight moves away, then Qxd5 wins the Knight} f6 {While this saves the knight, black will be left with doubled pawns on the g file and an isolated pawn on e5, all of which white can attack.} 8. cxd4 fxg5 9. O-O {Still hoping he will play exd4, then Qxd4 and the knight will eventually drop off the board.} Be6 10. Qb3 {I don't want to capture his pawn yet, so this is my only way to bring the Queen into the fight for the Knight.} b6 {While protecting the pawn, this move makes it harder to protect the Knight. Now c7-c6 leaves the pawn unguarded.} 11. Re1 {Getting ready to pin the Bishop.} c6 12. Nc3 {Increasing my attack on the knight, if Nxc3 then Bxe3, and the king will be put under extreme pressure from the Bishop, Queen and Rook.} Bb4 13. Rxe5 Bxc3 14. Rxe6+ Kf7 15. Rxc6 {Pawns begin to drop off the board} Re8 16. Bxd5+ Kf8 17. Qa3+ Qe7 18. bxc3 Rad8 19. Rc7 {Winning the Queen.} Rxd5 20. Rxe7 Rxe7 21. Bxg5 {A fianal Combination the win the game. If Rxg5, then Re1 wins the rook and aims for mate.} Rxg5 22. Re1 Rb5 {Hoping I will play Rxe7 instead of Qxc7 , then Rb1#} 23. Qxe7+ Kg8 24. Qe8# {I see games go similar to this often, the lesson to be learned is if you intend to play the two knights variation, read up on the proper moves first, or play the main line for the Italian Opening 3...Bc5, which is much safer.}
