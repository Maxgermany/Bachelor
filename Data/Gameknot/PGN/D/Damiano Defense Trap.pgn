1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 {f6?  better would be nc3 or d6.} 3. Nxe5 {Nxe5!  A deadly sac offering.} fxe5 {Black foolishly accepts.} 4. Qh5+ Ke7 5. Qxe5+ {Forcing black in a corner.} Kf7 6. Bc4+ {Black is done for.} Kg6 7. Qf5+ Kh6 {Anyone remember that age-old rule about not putting your king out in the middle of the board?  Yeah...} 8. d4+ {d4, a discover check and mate in a few, no matter how black plays this.} Qg5 {Black decides to go easily.} 9. Qxg5# {So, remember that if you're ever black and it's your second move after 1. e4 e5 2. nf3, don't play f6, unless you like losing odds.}
