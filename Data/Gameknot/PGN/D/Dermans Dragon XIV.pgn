1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {The starting position in the thematic tournament. Besides the Yugoslav attack, the older main line involving kingside castling is still viable but much less fashionable these days.} 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 O-O {There are a few interesting lines where black delays castling in order to throw white off his staple kingside attack.} 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4 {The main move for the Yugoslav attack but nowadays it's losing favor to immediate long castling where there many lines to chose from for white, unlike this older main line.} Bd7 10. O-O-O Rb8 {This little rook move is what brought the Dragon back into the limelight of Grand Master play.} 11. g4 {Going for the usual style of attack in this line. However, this move might be a little slow as black won't give white enough time to mount the attack.} b5 {Not taking any time and gambiting a pawn to open a direct line of attack against the white king.} 12. Ndxb5 {Taking the pawn is counter-intuitive, not only because tactical tricks that follow but because this activates black rook, which together with the g7 bishop now become very active.} Ne5 {Opening the d7 bishop, attacking on c4 and f3. White is hard pressed for a good move.} 13. Na3 {Sadly this isn't it. It's still hard finding anything that would work for White here. 13.Be2 is the only move, and now after 13...Nxf3 14.Bxe2 Bxb5 15.Nxb5 Rxb5, black has a very pleasant position, recovered the pawn and is en route to a heavy attack.} Nxf3 {One of the points against playing an early g4 in the Dragon Sicilian. } 14. Qf2 {Now this move is really asking for it. 14.Qg2 would have been better, but black is still much better.} Nxe4 {One of the typical sacrifices for black in the this defense. White has his pick of the two black knights but neither will bring him any relief.} 15. Qxf3 {White might have been scared of 15.Nxe4 but it was still slightly better. The forced lines goes like this 15.Nxe4 Bxb2+ 16.Kb1 Bxa3+ 17.Bb3 Bxg4. White is 3 pawns down but at least has some counterplay against the scatter black pieces and his king is slightly safer.} Nxc3 16. bxc3 Qa5 17. Nb1 {Trying to save the knight but losing the game. A better move would have been 17.Rdf1 and just ignoring the loose knight.} Rxb1+ {The tactical refutation of white's last mistake. Now c3 is again undefended and the king is forced on the open b-file under black's line of fire.} 18. Kd2 {White must have thought he was going to get mated if he took the rook. 18.Kxb1 Qxc3. However he missed the defensive move 19.Kc1 and there is no mate so black has to be satisfied with taking some of the material back. 19...Qb2+ 20. Kd2 Qb4+ 21.Kc1 Bxg4, winning white's queen.} Qxc3+ {Now all of white's pieces start dropping off.} 19. Ke2 Qxc4+ 20. Kf2 Rxd1 21. Qxd1 {Holding on to scraps, trying to cover c2 but it's all over anyway.} Bxg4 22. Qd3 {I had intended 22...Qc6 here trying to weave a matting net against the white monarch but my opponent saw the futility of his resistance and resigned here.}
