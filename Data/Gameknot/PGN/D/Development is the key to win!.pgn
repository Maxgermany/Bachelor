1. e4 {This was one of my games from the 99th GK tournament, my opponent was tech460, I had white pieces and the game started with e4.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {After e5, Nf3 we have d6, Philidor's defence.} 3. Bc4 {White played Bc4, Steinitz Philidor, for quick development. } Be7 {Black responded with Be7, standard move, and probably the best move.} 4. Nc3 {In this position, white would normally play c3, and then play c4 at some point, but I prefer my knight on c3, I simply continued with Nc3.} c6 {c6, first inaccurate move by black, Nf6 would be a much better move, I'm not sure why this move was played, maybe c6 is to support d5? } 5. O-O Bf6 {After white castled king side black played Bf6, I thought he might play Ne7 in the next move and then castle king side. } 6. d4 {I played d4, my king is safe, black's king is still two moves away from castle, so I would like to open up the files for the attack, and also clear the path for my dsb. } exd4 7. Nxd4 Bxd4 {After exd4, Nxd4 we have Bxd4 from black! I don't see the point of this exchange, black should have played Ne7 and then castle.  } 8. Qxd4 Qf6 {After Qxd4 black offered a queen trade at this point, obviously, capturing black queen only helps black to develop. } 9. Rd1 {I didn't want to play Qe3, because queen would be blocking the bishop, black would gain a tempo from Qd1, and Qd3 would be awkward for white, because black would play b5, and after white plays Bb3, c5 would be a killer, I have also considered Be3, but again, black would pawn-storm my queen side, and gain space advantage. that's the reason I played Rd1, get the rook activated, and develop dsb next. } Qxd4 10. Rxd4 {after queens are exchanged, I got a centralized rook :P, black is way behind in development, and plus d6 pawn is lost, black just can't defend it. } Ke7 {Ke7?! o_O?! why?! d6 pawn is going to fall for sure, and now black is giving up castle right? I got no idea what is going on....} 11. Bf4 {Bf4 developing dsb with tempo.} Ke8 {LOL, now Ke8, black wasted a move and lost his castle right. } 12. Rxd6 {Rxd6 with the idea to play Rad1.} Ne7 {Finally Ne7 was played, poor black king is staring at the rook, but just can't castle. } 13. Rad1 {Rad1 developing rook with mate in one threat. Have a look at this position, white has activated all the pieces, but black only developed his knight, and his king is exposed to the attack! } Nd7 {Black's choice was limited, and played Nd7 } 14. Bb3 {Bb3, avoiding b5.} a5 {a5 was played, with the idea to play b5, a4 to trap my lsb?} 15. Na4 {Na4 was played, this move stops a4, and looking to play Nb6, which forks the rook on a8 and the knight on d7, because black's d7 knight is pinned, if it moves Rd8 would be mate. } Ng6 {Black saw this coming, and played Ng6, now my plan does not work anymore, because if Nb6 then black can simply capture my knight and Rd8 won't be mate.} 16. Be3 c5 {After Be3 black played c5, blunder! Now everything is falling apart for black.} 17. Nxc5 {Nxc5, adding more pressure on d7 knight, black knight is now having a really hard time.} Nge5 {Nge5 protects d7 knight, black's last ditch effort} 18. Ba4 {Ba4 pinning the knight.} Ke7 {Ke7, getting out of the pin, but the knight is a goner. } 19. Rd6xd7+ {I played Rxd7+, Nxd7 comes to mind at first, but black can play Nc4, I just don't like the position. I was already up in material, I can give the material back, and the position advantage is still mine.} Bxd7 20. Nxd7 Rad8 {After Bxd7, Nxd7 black played Rad8! looks like a logical move, it seems like white knight on d7 is pinned, and black is going to get back the material (obviously if knight moves, then Rxd1# would be disaster for me), however, black overlooked one move!} 21. Bc5+ {Bc5+! and black resigned, because white has forced mate in this position. Let's see, if black plays Ke6, then Bb3+, black would have to block with Nc4, and then Bxc4#! what if black plays Ke8 instead of Ke6? Then Nf6#, discovered double check and mate! That's the end of the game, black made several mistakes, but his biggest mistake was not developing his pieces fast enough. Anyway I think it is an interesting game overall, and I definitely enjoyed playing it. Thanks for your attention, I hope you also enjoyed it, feel free to leave comments. Chao!}
