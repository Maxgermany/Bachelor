[Opening "King's Indian defence, 3.Nc3 (E61)"]

1. d4 {I start with the usual} Nf6 {No surprise here} 2. c4 {I continue} g6 {So is he going to a King's Indian or maybe an Grunfeld Defence?} 3. Nc3 {I continue} c6 {What is this? Maybe he will follow up with d6, going back to main lines?} 4. e4 {So I take the centre} d5 {So this is what he planned. He was about 20 minutes for the match. I spent that on working out the best reply to this, over the next few moves, I moved a lot slower, so by move 10 we were more or less level in time} 5. e5 {I found out later on the Gameknot Opening Databases, this was played in the 2 games on the database of world matches.} Ne4 {This is more or less forced. Now of those two games, Kasparov, Garry (2800) vs. Kamsky, Gata (2640) continued with Bd3 and white won. After the game my opponent said he felt that he felt this was the strongest continuation for white, but I am not convinced. The other game continued with Be3 and ended in a draw, - Kurhinen Boris (2140) vs. Timchenko Aleks… (2100) I chose another move, which looks quite logical} 6. Nxe4 {This was played in 3 Gameknot games} dxe4 {He naturally takes back. Now on Gameknot database, there are three games from this position, g3 ended ½-½ iin tesomator (1824) vs. vandy (1939) f3 ended 1-0 in old_kondor (1835) vs. super-tee (1673) Be3 ended 0-1 vicit (1824) vs. watbot3000 (1705) } 7. Be3 {My first ideas were to play this followed by Qc2, with the idea of not allowing him to play Bf5 followed by e4-e3, but I changed my mind....} Bg7 {He continues development.} 8. Qd2 {With dreams of a king side attack. The other game ended with 8.	Qc2	Bf5 9.	Ne2	c5 10.	O-O-O	Nc6 11.	dxc5	Qa5 12.	b3	Nb4 13.	Qb2	Nd3+ 14.	Rxd3	exd3 15.	Ng3	Qe1#. Very weak play by white!} c5 {So he hits the centre} 9. d5 {I advance} Bxe5 {He takes} 10. Bxc5 {I take back} Nd7 {He hits my bishop} 11. Bd4 {I decide to exchange his powerful bishop} Bxd4 {He takes} 12. Qxd4 {I take back} Qa5+ {He throws in a queen check} 13. Qd2 {Mine comes back} Qxd2+ {He takes} 14. Kxd2 {I take back. Now I think I have a very slight edge, because of his doubled pawns. but he has slightly better development.} a5 {This was a surprise, he gains c5 for this knight, but I am not convinced it is better than Ne5} 15. Ne2 {So my knight comes out} Nc5 {He continues} 16. Nc3 {My knight protects e4} f5 {I was quite pleased with this, it reduces the scope of his Bc8} 17. Be2 {My bishop comes out} e6 {He hits my pawn d6. After a long think I played} 18. d6 {This looks very weak, but I couldn' see how he could actually win it without giving me a pawn back somewhere. Besides, I have a plan to support it with b3, a3, b4 and c5} Bd7 {Instead of going after the pawn he mobilises his bishop to a better square} 19. Kc2 {I want to be able to protect the pawn d6 with a rook down the d file. I also protect b3, preparing my plan.} Bc6 {So he continues with his plan} 20. b3 {And me with mine} Kf7 {He mobilises his king} 21. a3 {I continue with my plan} Rhd8 {So he hits my pawn} 22. b4 {I hit his knight} axb4 {He takes} 23. axb4 {I take back} Rxa1 {He takes} 24. Rxa1 {I take back} Nd3 {This is forced.} 25. b5 {I drive his bishop back. } Be8 {He retreats. I had a long think here. f3 is possible, and strong, but I felt it better to go into a Knight v Bishop ending.} 26. Bxd3 {So I take} exd3+ {He takes} 27. Kxd3 {I take back} Rxd6+ {He takes} 28. Ke3 {I centralise my king} Rd7 {This surprised me. Why not just e5 to mobilise the king side majority with e5?} 29. f4 {Now his Be8 is in danger of becoming a "bad bishop"} Ke7 {His king comes over} 30. Rd1 {I offer a rook exchange} Rc7 {He avoids} 31. Kd4 {My king comes up} Bf7 {Not sure if this achieves anything} 32. Re1 {Threatening Nd5+} Rd7+ {He throws in a check} 33. Kc5 {King advances} Kd8 {I think this is a mistake, allowing me to force off rooks.} 34. Rd1 {Which I do} Rxd1 {So he takes} 35. Nxd1 {I take back} Kc7 {He stops my king advance} 36. Nc3 {This may be a mistake. Maybe N-b2-d3-e5 is better. What do you think dear reader?} h6 {He tries to put some pawns on black squares} 37. h4 {Which I stop} b6+ {He checks} 38. Kd4 {King retreats} Kd6 {His king stops me coming in.} 39. Na4 {But now he las to lose material, his king can't protect b6 and stop my king advancing. He finds the best way to lose material} e5+ {So he sacs a pawn} 40. fxe5+ {I take} Kc7 {Now he protects b6} 41. Nc3 {So my knight re-positions itself} g5 {He goes for pawn exchanges on the king side} 42. Nd5+ {I throw in a check} Kb7 {King has to stay on the b pawn} 43. Ne7 {I hit his f pawn} Be6 {He protects} 44. h5 {I avoid the pawn exchange, but the pawn is vulnerable on a white square} f4 {He opens up a diagonal to attack it!} 45. Ng6 {Now I have to manoeuvre my knight, so I can pick up his h pawn} Bg4 {He goes after mine} 46. Ne7 {I am heading for f5} Bxh5 {He takes} 47. Nf5 {I hit his h pawn} Bg4 {He hits my knight} 48. Nxh6 {I take } Be6 {Now the bishop dominates my knight. I think I have missed by chance now, I think this position is drawn.} 49. c5 {My only chance} bxc5+ {He takes} 50. Kxc5 {I take} g4 {He pushes} 51. Kd4 {I come back} Kb6 {He goes after my b pawn} 52. Ke4 {I go after his pawns. There is an interesting variation here, 	Bd5+ 53.	Kxd5	f3 54.	gxf3	g3 55.	e6	g2 56.	e7	g1=Q 57.	e8=Q	 But it is still a drawn position - he can start checking me, and I can't stop the checks without losing my queen.} f3 {He advances} 53. gxf3 {I take} gxf3 {he takes back} 54. Kxf3 {I take back. This is completely drawn now, I play on a few moves. } Kxb5 55. Kf4 Kc6 56. Kg5 Kd7 57. Kf6 Ba2 58. Nf5 Ke8 59. Nd6+ {Draw agreed. Many thanks for reading this annotation.
