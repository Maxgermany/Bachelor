1. d4 d5 2. c4 {My favourite opening, the Queen's Gambit. (Come on, take the pawn...)} dxc4 {If I no longer want the c-pawn, at least my opponent does.} 3. e4 {I take advantage of the absence of my opponent's central pawn by grabbing as big a share of the centre as I can, as well as opening up an attack line on the c4-pawn with my bishop.} b5 {My opponent is fighting for that pawn! In the Queen's Gambit Accepted, it is important for Black to compensate for White's control of the centre by grabbing a big share of the queenside. And if this happens to defend the pawn too...} 4. Nc3 c6 5. e5 {I can't resist shoving my unimpeded central pawns into my opponent's territory, squeezing him as far back as possible and trying to use this to recapture my pawn.} e6 6. g3 Bb7 7. Bg2 {The pressure builds up on the backward, weak and for the moment pinned pawn on c6. If I can somehow remove this pawn, all of Black's control on the queenside will collapse.} Ne7 8. Bg5 {Removing a defender of the c6-pawn, but this pawn shows no sign of falling. My main fear is that my opponent will be able to hold his pawn advantage and get into an endgame still holding it.} h6 9. Bxe7 Bxe7 10. b3 {I want to deal with those advanced queenside pawns of Black's; I am planning a4 next and Black's whole pawn formation is under fire.} Bb4 11. Nge2 Qc7 12. a4 Nd7 {Obviously, my opponent has decided not to take the pawns. So now after, say, 13.axb5 cxb5 14.bxc4 bxc4 Black's pawn on c4 is isolated and consequently weak.} 13. O-O Bxc3 14. Nxc3 cxb3 {Now he takes the bait. In fact, this was probably the best way of avoiding the loss of his extra pawn, but he still has no positional compensation for my advanced e-pawn.} 15. Qxb3 Ba6 16. axb5 cxb5 {Aha! A blunder. My opponent doesn't notice the discovered attack on his bishop.} 17. Rxa6 {No more bishop.} Rb8 18. Nxb5 {And the pawn vanishes as well.} Qd8 19. Rb1 {My opponent is behind by a bishop, has lost his extra pawn and is cramped by my central pawns and, to cap it all, my forces are massing on the queenside.} O-O {Getting the king out of danger, but losing the pawn on a7.} 20. Rxa7 g6 21. Qc4 {Getting out of that potentially harmful pin of the knight.} Nb6 22. Qc7 {My queen comes in to seek more material.} Qxc7 23. Nxc7 Nd5 {This allows me to consolidate my material advantage with a double exchange.} 24. Rxb8 Rxb8 25. Nxd5 exd5 26. Bxd5 {When the dust has cleared, I suddenly have a passed pawn! This is too much. Black resigns.}
