1. Nc3 {The Dunst opening. (I only know because I looked it up.)} d5 {Black can advance any of his central pawns, and this seems the best option, since there is a threat to advance further and drive away the Knight.} 2. e4 {Possibly White's best and most logical reply?} dxe4 {I shy away from 2...d4, which now seems risky, and the other options available (2...e6, 2...c6...2...Nf6)} 3. Nxe4 Nd7 {Probably too cautious, but I'm in unfamiliar territory.} 4. Bc4 {White builds up an attack on my f7 pawn and I have to be careful: 4...Ngf6 5.Bxf7+ might be just what he wants; a Bishop sacrifice to bring out my King.} e6 {That's not going to happen; I play safe.} 5. Nf3 {White continues to develop.} Ngf6 {So do I.} 6. Nxf6+ {Seems a shame to go all the way across the board just to remove this Knight.} Nxf6 {Especially when it's just replaced by another!} 7. O-O Be7 {Caution is still reigning, but there are probably better ways to be cautious: 7...Bd6 guards e5 and 7...a6 guards b5} 8. d3 O-O {I've conceded a little too much space and 9.Ne5 looks threatening...} 9. h3 {But White is being cautious too. We have played each other hundreds of times and neither wants to play anything risky.} c5 {I can't think where to go, and decide to get my Bishop onto the long diagonal. But 9...b6 right away would have achieved this.} 10. a3 {This is too cautious; nothing wrong with 10.Bf4, covering that e5 square.} b6 {It gives me a tempo, really, to carry on with the plan.} 11. Re1 {White prefers to cover e5 with the Rook; maybe he's waiting for my dark-squared Bishop to move and wants the option of pinning my Knight?} Bb7 {I now have my Bishop where I want it.} 12. Ng5 {His idea, I think, is after 12...h6 13.Nxe6? giving up a piece for two pawns. But it's a little premature. Nonetheless, the possibility tempts me into a silly move.} Bd5 {Not too disastrous, but having spent so much time getting my Bishop onto the long diagonal, giving it up like this was foolsih when 12...h6 would have been fine.} 13. Bxd5 Nxd5 {Not too much difference between this and other recaptures, and it reveals an attack on the Knight...} 14. Qg4 {I had hoped to drive the Knight away, but I have just allowed the Queen in instead. What was looking like a level position now seems a bit dangerous, though White doesn't really have much if I keep my head.} Nf6 {I try to drive away the Queen...} 15. Qf3 {h4 is surely a better square?} Nd5 {My Knight hops back into the centre, revealing the attack on the Knight again. 15...h6 is probably simpler!} 16. Ne4 Nf6 {Our little dance continues. I am being very cautious but also don't really know where to go!} 17. Qg3 {Threatening 18.Bh6, which would be nasty.} Nxe4 {I decide to remove the Knights, leaving my Bishop and Queen free to come out via f6 if necessary. 18.Bh6 is not on, of course, as the Queen is threatened, so White must recapture.} 18. Rxe4 {Taking with the pawn is possibly better, with the Rook behind it. My next move could then be stymied with a pawn advance.} Bf6 19. c3 {Freeing the Bishop from its guard duty, but removing a defender from the d-pawn.} Rc8 {Too passive, I suspect, leaving White to build up his attack...} 20. Rg4 {It looks more dangerous than it is, because my h-pawn can easily drive the Rook away...} h5 21. Re4 {And it does.} h4 {I really need to think about centralising my Queen, perhaps on d5, but I'm still playing a waiting game, using my pawn to drive away White's pieces.} 22. Qf3 Rc6 {My rather laborious plan is to bring the Rook to the open d-file to attack the d-pawn.} 23. Bf4 {White's position looks impressive, but I'm not really in any great danger. But I'm drifting through the game...} Re8 {And with this slight error, White sees his chance...} 24. Ra4 {I'm about to lose a pawn, and I see, belatedly, the point of White's last move: I can't defend the a-pawn with 24...Rc7. And 24..Qa8 doesn't prevent the loss of the pawn, since the Rook exchange will follow.} Qc8 {I have to let White have the pawn, and my heart sinks.} 25. Rxa7 e5 {To allow Rc7, though 25...Re7 achieves the same thing without having to move the e-pawn.} 26. Be3 Rd6 {White's last move has left the e-pawn undefended, something I take advantage of.} 27. Bg5 {The move he should have made before. He is hoping for 27...Bxg5 28.Qxf7+ with mate following. But I just get a chance to try to shift his Rook...} Qb8 28. Rb7 {The logical response. And now, alarmed by White's attack and the loss of a pawn, I start to go astray. 28...Qa8 probably still holds the position} Qd8 {But I'm worried about the build up of attack on my Bishop.} 29. Rd1 {White could just take the h-pawn, but he decides to bring in more pieces. So I get a second bit at Qa8...} e4 {Though this is just as good at neutralising the attack...} 30. Qh5 {Again, looks alarming, but 30...g6 31.Bxf6 Qxf6 32.Qe2 and White doesn't have much.} Re7 {Tactical miscalculation, hoping White will exchange Rooks. But even that leaves me struggling a bit: 31.Rxe7 Bxe7 32.Bxe7 Qxe7 33.d4 isn't good for me.} 31. Bxf6 {But White goes for the better exchange, which really leaves me in trouble...} Rxf6 {31...gxf6 isn't much better. At least I get to keep my pawns together.} 32. Rxe7 {White could just take my e-pawn right away, since the Rook on d1 is defended. But he's material up and wants exchanges...} Qxe7 33. dxe4 Rh6 {33...Rd6, at least contests the open file. 33...Qxe4 34.Rd8+ and I'm finished.} 34. Qg4 {34.Qd5 would be strong too, though White is eyeing c8 for the Queen.} Rg6 {Driving your opponet to the square he wants to go to is not good!} 35. Qc8+ {Now I feel like the proverbial rabbit in the headlights, as I can see what's coming....} Kh7 36. Rd8 {Threatening mate on h8. I have to move the Rook to give the King an escape square. But even 36...Rg5 37.Rh8+ Kg6 38.Qc6+ Qf6 39.Qxf6 Kxf6 and White just wins the endgame. So I get a bit wild...} Rxg2+ {If I can draw out the King, maybe there is a chance of perpetual check...} 37. Kxg2 Qxe4+ 38. Kf1 Qb1+ 39. Ke2 Qc2+ {Not 39...Qxb2+ since the King can escape and I run out of checks. 40.Kf3 and I'm out of checks anyway, but now White makes the error I have been hoping for...} 40. Rd2 Qe4+ {Now the King cannot escape my checks; 41.Kf1 or 41.Kd1 and the position repeats.} 41. Kd1 Qb1+ {The King must go back to e7 and 41...Qe4+ follows. It's a draw. A narrow escape indeed.}
