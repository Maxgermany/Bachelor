1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. h3 Bf5 4. Bf4 e6 {The game started out innocently enough...} 5. Ne5 {Big problem.  That knight really sucks.  I really wanted to take that horse to the glue factory, but for the time being, he will just have to sit there.} Bb4+ 6. c3 {Not sure what I was doing there.  I'm a young male, perhaps I was daydreaming about other things.} Be7 7. e3 O-O 8. h4 Nbd7 9. Nd2 c5 10. f3 Qb6 {I am slightly pleased with the position.} 11. b3 Rac8 12. g4 {I am no longer pleased with my position.  I am cursing obscenities at the screen for making this happen.} cxd4 {I have a plan.  Not a great plan, but my bishop is Private Ryan, and he MUST be saved.} 13. exd4 Nh5 {Private Hoof is offering to lend Private Ryan a hand.  Or rather, offer his life.} 14. Nxd7 {I can't remember if this was part of the plan.} Qd8 15. Nxf8 {Taking the bait.  If he had taken the knight with his g-pawn instead, he could have held the defense, provided he made the correct moves.  Now Private Brian, Private Ryan's black brother, comes into play.} Bxh4+ 16. Ke2 {Taking Private Brian doesn't save the game.  I don't think so anyways, I analyzed it to an extent.} Nxf4+ {Now Private Hoof gets a piece of King Henry the Eighth.} 17. Ke3 Rxc3+ 18. Kxf4 {Private Hoof dies.  At least his brave sacrifice didn't go in vain.} Qd6# {And Queen Elizabeth shows why killing your wives isn't a good idea.  Thank you for reading my inane commentary about a silly chess game.}
