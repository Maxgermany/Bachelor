1. d4 f5 {Dutch defense  } 2. g3 d6 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. c4 g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O Nc6 8. Bg5 {Perhaps this isn't the right square for the bishop.} Ne4 {If 8. Nxe4 fxe4  9. Nh4 nxd4 is good for black.} 9. Be3 Nxc3 10. bxc3 {Black has weakened White's queenside pawn structure.} h6 {stops the knight going to g5, but creates a target on h6.} 11. h4 {stops ...g5} e5 {If white takes the e5 pawn a queen swap is likely, which would not suit white at this stage.} 12. Qd2 Kh7 {Protects the h pawn. Later in the game the black king's position on the edge of the board will be  a problem for black.} 13. Ne1 {knight is aiming for d3, and then f4.} Bd7 14. Nd3 e4 15. Nf4 {A good outpost for the knight.} Na5 {threatens the weakened c4 pawn.} 16. c5 Nc4 17. Qc1 dxc5 18. f3 {white is in no hurry to capture back on c5, which would create doubled isolated pawns on the  c file. It's more important to attack the pawn on e4.} Re8 19. fxe4 fxe4 20. dxc5 Bf5 {? Perhaps Nxe3 would be better.} 21. Rd1 Qe7 22. Bd4 {White is pleased to have the bishop on d4, protecting c3 and preparing e3. This also frees up  the white queen.} c6 23. e3 Rad8 24. Bf1 {Chases the knight away from c4.} Ne5 25. Kf2 {White fears 25...Nf3  26 Kf2 Nxh4 27 gxh4 Qxh4 which looks promising for Black. With this move white can answer ...Nf3 with Ng2, and then ...Nxh4 is met by Nxh4.} Ref8 {white has to be careful of a pin or discovered check on the open f file.} 26. Be2 {Anticipating the opening (or half opening) of the h file. White wants to transfer the rook back to h1.} g5 27. hxg5 Qxg5 {Worth considering is ...hxg5 28 Rh1  Bh6 and white has real problems with the f4 knight, ...Nd3  (forking king and queen), and ...Bg4 (possibly with a discovered check).} 28. Rh1 {Maybe the rook will go to h4 at some stage.} Bg4 29. Qc2 {Threatening the e4 pawn with check, and moving out of a possible knight fork on d3. Also white  now has to worry about ...Bxe2 30 Kxe2? Qxg3} Qf5 30. Bxe5 {!! A sequence that exploits blacks over reliance on his queen and ends with the winning of  the e4 pawn.} Bxe5 31. Bxg4 Qxg4 32. Qxe4+ {Black has invested a lot in the e4 pawn and now it has been taken.} Qf5 {Only way to avoid losing the bishop.} 33. Qxf5+ {White is happy to swap down to an endgame with a passed pawn and a more centralized king.} Rxf5 34. Rad1 {Challenging black for control of the open d file.} Bxf4 {? A strange move. Unites white's pawns and swaps a more active bishop for a pinned knight. Also black, who is positionally weaker should not simplify.} 35. exf4 {Of course white doesn't play 35 Rxd8? Bg5 ! 36 Ke2 Bxd8. (Which wins a piece for Black.)} Rfd5 36. Ke2 {Another possibility would be Rxd5 Rxd5 37 Re1. If black tries ...Rxd1 37 Rxd1 Rxd1 38Kxd1 h5 39Ke2 Kg6 etc, then the white f pawn will queen one move before the black h pawn. Then white can force a swap of queens and (with his king on e5) win the resulting endgame.} h5 {Bad move. Weakens blacks h pawn unnecessarily. Black needed to play something like ...Kg6 first.} 37. Rxd5 {? White misses out on the stronger 37 Rxh5 ! Rxh5  38. Rxd8 which wins a pawn.} Rxd5 38. g4 Rxc5 {Restoring material equality but with a much weaker position.} 39. Rxh5+ {! Forcing the swap of rooks.} Rxh5 40. gxh5 Kh6 {Black will regain material equality but his king will be marginalized} 41. Ke3 Kxh5 42. Ke4 {Even though white is not up in material his centralized king and advanced passed pawn means he  has won the game (if he plays carefully.)} Kg6 43. Ke5 Kf7 44. Kd6 {Sacrifices his passed pawn to win blacks pawns.} Kf6 45. Kc7 Kf5 46. Kxb7 Kxf4 47. Kxc6 Ke4 48. c4 Kd4 49. c5 Kc4 50. Kd6 {And its all over bar the shouting.}
