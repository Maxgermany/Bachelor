1. d4 {d4... my favourite... it means i can play...} f5 {dutch! i've had a lot of success with this... let's just hope he stays on book for a while...} 2. c4 {good good...} Nf6 {go through the motions...} 3. Nf3 {of course...} d6 {etc...} 4. Nc3 {aren't openings fun?} g6 {g6... leningrad defence... highly effective in my experience...} 5. g3 {ooh, he's going for the fianchetto too?} Bg7 {didn't see that coming, eh?} 6. Bg2 {and knock me back with surprise too...} O-O {and what will he do...} 7. O-O {* shock *} Nc6 {right then... sometimes i play Nb-d7, but i felt Nc3 was more appropriate here...} 8. d5 {as expected...} Ne5 {so, will he take?} 9. Qb3 {no... } Ned7 {not sure why i played that... i should've took his knight... } 10. Be3 {he's ahead on development... rooks linked already... i've wasted 2 moves getting my knight to d7...} a6 {another mistake i think... } 11. Ng5 {the knight's moving in... i should've taken him dammit... } Ne5 {i'm not really making any progress, am i...?} 12. c5 {oh yeah, the discovered check...} Kh8 {now i need that pawn on d5 to stay there...} 13. c6 {erm... i think i'll decline the take...} b5 {i think b6 would've been wiser, but hey... i accept if this gets to endgame he's got a stronger position with his advanced pawns, but i'm hoping it won't get to that...} 14. a4 {there's why i should've played b6...} bxa4 {little choice...} 15. Rxa4 {and now he has his rook developed... my white bishop can't move... his knight is deep in my territory... i consider this to be a weak position, especially against a stronger player... matter of time...} Nfg4 {don't want his rook getting to h4... that would not be nice...} 16. Bd4 {ominous...} h6 {get lost kinght...} 17. Nh3 {good, he didn't go to e6... i guess he wanted to keep those advanced pawns linked...} a5 {with the intention of developing the bishop behind it...} 18. Rfa1 {obviously, i hadn't taken that into account... now i'm a pawn down...} Kh7 {i was looking at Nxc6 with a discovered attack on the bishop and rook (obviously i was hoping for Rxa5?), but he would check me when he took the bishop... } 19. e3 {to protect the bishop, obviously...} e6 {i need to develop the queen... i hope he takes it, but i doubt he will...} 20. Ra4xa5 {no, didn't think so... well, what options do i have?} Rxa5 {surprise...} 21. Rxa5 {and surprise again...} Qe7 {before he pins the bishop...} 22. Nf4 {now, a subtle mistake... he gives me hope... } Nf3+ {! made possible only because he played e3... bishop must take... or... 23. Kh1? Nxf2# or 23. Kf1? Nd2  and bye bye queen} 23. Bxf3 {and the reason i gave him a kinght? you've seen it, surely...} e5 {yes, that's all... now, i expected Nxg6 here, so was surprised by what he played...} 24. Ra8 {what does that gain? i couldn't see his reasoning... but still at this point i felt he was stronger...} exd4 {take the bishop... taking the knight was never really an option...} 25. exd4 {exd4?? this was a glaring error... but i missed it... } Bxd4 {only after i played this did i realise i could've won in three... Qe1  Kg2 Qxf2  Kh1/h3 Qxh2#... i could've kicked myself... how did i miss it? how did he? has he noticed yet...?} 26. Nd1 {dammit... he's saved it... there is still hope though...} Bxf2+ {take it take it take it...} 27. Kg2 {dammit... he's woken up... } Qe1 {gotta be worth a go... i'm out of ammo after this though...} 28. Bxg4 {Bxg4?? a bad error and i've noticed! he only had one move that could save him, but he didn't realise it... that was Ne2... off we go...} Qg1+ {now, he's got to be careful here... Kh3 is mate in three...} 29. Kf3 {as he's aware...} fxg4+ {again, dangerous territory... Ke4? Bf5#...} 30. Ke2 {it's a bit late to wise up now my friend...} Qe1+ {and he resigns... obviously Kd3 Bf5 wins... his rook is lost and my bishop is safe... mate will be coming along very soon... }
