[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Torre attack"]

1. d4 {(dieselengine9) d4. It presents the most options for an open position from my experience. } Nf6 {(graderguy) Nf6: a look at the GK database shows that this gives the best odds for black.  It controls some center squares and clears one spot for eventual castle on that side. The  common lines have a fianchetto King side, but I don't always play that as I am really not  a fan of fianchetto ahead of my king.} 2. Nf3 {dieselengine9) Nf3: It's not the 'book' move, but it's my preferred response to Nf6. c4  makes me feel behind because of Black's 2:e6 which gets his bishop out and gets him  to a kingside castle, and also tends to force queen movement earlier than I'm comfortable with.} e6 {(graderguy) e6: Like I said, Fianchetto is not my favored playing style. This move opens  up the BS Bishop to development and will allow a rapid castle once it's played. I am looking  at d6 for my bishop later, pointing at the h2 square after white castles. White might play  b-g5 but I am willing to suffer the pin right now as there are many ways to remove or nullify it..} 3. c4 {(dieselengine9) c4: While I feel e3 would be much safer, c4 is the book move and also  stands to promise for a more open game. If I'm going to beat a player of better caliber  than myself, I've learned that I need the game to be more of an open than a closed position.} b6 {(graderguy) b6: We are now in pretty familiar territory for me, from either side of the board.  I also like the open positions a queen's pawn game can lead to. This puts us in the Queen's  Indian Defense. I like the QS fianchetto as it puts the bishop in attacking position on his castled  king ( when he castles). I will still be able to get my DS Bishop out and allow for the castle. I always  like a knight on f6 when I castle king side. I do have a tendency to forget to defend it with  something besides the g pawn sometimes and end up with a torn up pawn defense in front  of my king. I often move B-e7 to avoid the getting the knight pinned to the queen. B-b7, B-e7,  or B-b4 will likely be my next move, I will be inclined to move the BS bishop to allow for a castle asap.  } 4. e3 {(dieselengine9) e3: It releases the w/s bishop for castling. g3 is the book move, but f@ck a  k/s finchetto when playing a high rated 7th degree asshat. It's a prayer to be checkmated  in such a situation.} Bb7 {(graderguy) B-b7: WS Bishop pointing squarely at his soon to be castled king. Allows for  c5 in the future, which N-c6 prevents. I keep wondering what my explanation for giving  away a minor piece will be later on.. :)} 5. Be2 {(dieselengine9) Be2: I'm gonna play this hand close to my chess till Dave screws up and  gives away a minor piece later on. (graderguy) HA HA HA...} Be7 {(graderguy) B-e7: Castling is on my mind. Also protecting the knight with something  besides the queen. I hate that some asshat knows every move I'm thinking of.} 6. O-O { (dieselengine9) O-O: I castle. My pieces are all protected and my opponent has not  reached out to attack yet. It's great knowing what Dave thinks, though I feel when  he has one of his "fits" and puts THAT in the comment box it's going to be even MORE  disturbing than a usual game on his lunatic fringe. (graderguy) I'm gonna show him "lunatic"......} O-O {(graderguy) 0-0: it's why I moved all those other damn pieces. Still have a lingering knight to develop,  but he can wait....} 7. Nc3 {(dieselengine9) Nc3: I couldnt really think of anything better to do that I couldn't still do  with this knight developed. I also wonder why N got designated to the knight when the  king moves so infrequently. That really has to confuse younger players who are studying  both grammar and the game of chess (and it's scoring.)  } d5 {(graderguy) d5: I have three pieces pointing towards d5, so it seemed like a good time to  advance my center pawn. With the B pawn advanced White cannot simply bypass the  attack of the D pawn. This also clears d7 for the b square knight if I decide to move it there.  I have not yet come up with an overall strategy yet, Need to make a few more moves.  My pieces seem to be in decent shape and there is attacking potential with the ws Bishop if  white makes an error....} 8. cxd5 {(dieselengine9) cxd5: I thought of resigning. This f**ker I'm playing has three pieces pointing  towards d5. With his B pawn advanced I can't bypass the attack of his freshly pushed D pawn.  If I screw up, he's going to frickin kill me with his w/s Bishop. All seems lost at this point for  black. Instead, I opted for cxd5, trading pawns and possibly a piece or two. This is going to give  him ridiculous position. I should know better than to play this sandbagging grandmaster. } exd5 {(graderguy) exd5: D'oh!} 9. a3 {(dieselengine9) a3: Limits movement of his black square bishop to twice as many squares  as mine can move, hoping to close off the position and last more than 20 moves. My king  is getting his affairs in order. He knows this asshat grandmaster will be at his door soon.} Nbd7 {graderguy) Nb-d7: After some recent experiences with getting my f file knight raped by weird  cosmologists, I am totally into guarding that knight like it's a rare gemstone. This does free  the DS bishop from guarding the knight and B-d6 attacking H2 might come into play at some  point. I like to keep h7 under guard because _I_ like to attack the other guy there, and I  assume he'd like that too! Which may be a horrible flaw in my thinking!  } 10. b4 {(dieselengine9) b4: This is in anticipation of his c5, which I honestly expected instead of his  Nbd7. This asshat is playing me like I'm some super intelligent cosmologist or something.  That doesn't bode well for a slug such as myself.  } c6 {c6: I am avoiding c5 for now. I am hoping that white will play b5 in response. Then I will  move c5. If white does not, then I will likely move a6 shoring up b5 so it is not a safe  haven for one of white's nasty little pawns.} 11. Bd2 {(dieselengine9) Bd2: I couldn't find anything else to do. It may help a little in the oncoming  attacks down the b and c file, and may support the B pawn if need be. It's usually this point  every game that I kick myself for playing such a high rated asshat so often.} Ne4 {(graderguy) Ne4: All pieces developed. Time to start screwing with Landon! This attacks  bishop and knight, so the odds are good he will opt for the trade. That will leave me a  pawn past the center line. I can shore that pawn up later with f5 if required. If he decides not to trade, the bishop is history. I will take it in a New York Second!!} 12. Nxe4 {(dieselengine9) Nxe4. This is a horrible position, but given the alternatives this was all I could really do.  My death is soon to follow. Resignation looms as a possibility. (editors note:) Diesel is a pessimist. I can't help him. His position at this time is not bad; paired bishops,  a rook that can take over the c-file, a knight (soon to be) roaming around in my back yard... poor bastard! } dxe4 { (graderguy) dxe4: Well, it's what I wanted, so let's see how it rolls from here.  Obviously the Knight will be moving, but thankfully, not many safe havens for him near my king.  The tension is broken, as they say, and now the middle game commences.  I am looking at e1 or e5 for his knight to land on.  In my opinion e1 would be a sissy move, and if Landon makes it, he needs help......} 13. Ne5 {(dieselengine9) Ne5: practically forced} c5 {(graderguy) c5: This leaves several possibilities. I am guessing b x c5 or nxd7 . My goal  is to open up the long diagonal and clear out all the crap in the center. This is where Landon  usually surprises me. Hopefully my queen will end up somewhere decent and safe. Surprise me!!} 14. Nxd7 { (dieselengine9) Nxd7: just killing time before I resign.  (editor): That's the spirit! Beat yourself!!!} Qxd7 {(graderguy) Qxd7: I'm not killing time. I'm killing Landon =)) . Now we will see some action on the b c or d file and clear out some of the riff-raff.  I think the open position there is to my advantage and I have attacking potential with both bishops. } 15. bxc5 {dieselengine9) bxc5: Through painstaking research I have found this position to be identical to  Morterford (W) vs Johansensburg (B) in 1780. Morterford used this move to win the game, and  I figure my opponent to use the same line as Johansensburg and suffer the same defeat. . . actually I just wanted to bxc5 before he could cxd4. I will figure out what to do once he  bxc5 here in a minute  } bxc5 {bxc5: followed by dxc5 followed by bxc5... see? told ya c5 would have some action.  I'll follow with a rook to d8 to put pressure on the bishop and queen. At least that is  where I am looking now, funny how our perceptions change after the pieces are _really_ gone!} 16. h3 {(dieselengine9) h3: better create a flight square. } cxd4 {cxd4: I see white going down a pawn here. I think it would have been better to take  the exchange on c5 rather than this. I foresee a possible move of the ds Bishop by  white to open up his queen on the d file. I plan on doubling a rook behind my queen in that case. } 17. Ba5 { (dieselengine9) Ba5: it saves my pawn for the moment. Hopefully I'll think of something  brilliant for the next move.} Qd5 {Qd5: attacks that miserable bishop and puts my queen in front of the ls Bishop pointing  at a mate square if I can just get one pawn out of the way. I hope the dipchit doesn't see  it, but since I'm TELLING him, I suspect he will. But Landon surprises me all the time.} 18. Bb4 {(dieselengine9) Bb4: this isn't going well. I'm gonna lose a lot of material but hopefully  I can stave off checkmate for after 20 moves.} Bxb4 { (graderguy) Bxb4: Seems like a fair trade. I'm going to want to get my rooks involved soon. Maybe a5 next?  } 19. axb4 {(dieselengine9) axb4: fullfilling the trade} Rfd8 { (graderguy) Rf-d8: Backing up the queen as well as thinking about R-d6. He might have fun out there!  } 20. Ra5 {(dieselengine9) ra5: a lame attempt and shooing away a queen, plus I decide to find a new supplier for moldboards.} Qe6 {(graderguy) Q-e6: Ok, screw the D file. This sets up a potential discovered attack on his  queen or pins the pawn to the queen if he takes the d pawn. Next stop may still be d6 for my rook.  } 21. Bg4 {(dieselengine9) bg4: nothin better to do.  (graderguy):%$(^^(*  @##&!^} Qg6 {(graderguy) Q-g6: still pointing at the king with bishop and queen, and now have protection back on the d-pawn.} 22. Bh5 {(dieselengine9) Bh5:attacks that mean black b**** again. } Qb6 {Comment: (graderguy) Qb6: escape!! attacks pawn, protects d pawn and gets my queen the heck out of there...} 23. Qb3 { (dieselengine9) Qb3: have to protect my pawn and rook. This will also keep things even   if dxe3, and gets my queen out of the revealed attack from his rook.  (graderguy): and apparently he did not see the beautiful position this allows him if I attempt  a pawn exchange @ e3, he would have rook, bishop and queen all pointing at  f7. what an asshat!} Rd7 {(graderguy) Rd7: have to protect f7. Pondering moving Kh8 later to free up the rook  and allow the f pawn to move. My eye is still on g2.. :-)  } 24. Rd1 {(dieselengine9) rd1. this will stave off dxe3 for a minute. I'm expecting rd8 in return.  i don't know what I'll do next.} d3 {(graderguy) d3: tightens up the d file by allowing the e pawn to protect, I' rather have  taken the white e pawn, but it looked like there were too many pitfalls in that line.  I may move Ra-c8 next to prepare forr d2 and potentially R-c1.  But who knows what Landon will do... not even HE is sure!  } 25. Rg5 {(dieselengine9) rg5: time to point some firepower at the king and shake things up a little.  } Rc8 {(graderguy) R-c8: Prevents R-c1. But what I am really looking at is the pawn advancing to d2 then r-c1 for a pretty sure advancement. I should be worried bout that rook, but I choose to ignore him right now (likely a stupid thought)} 26. Bg4 {dieselengine9) Bg4. By my calculations, this will take one of his rooks for one of my  bishops and help even things out just a little.} Bc6 {graderguy) B-c6: I have opted to spot diesel a rook to make him feel good.  Poor guy has some serious issues with self esteem, maybe this will help!  } 27. Bxd7 { bxd7: takes the rook. I can see a lot of interesting possibilities for Dave's next move,  but feeling he will bxd7 I conditional my next move.} Bxd7 {Comment: (graderguy) BxB: I'll complete the "trade" and hope for better days.} 28. Qb2 {Qb2: it protects d2 and allows for Rc1 to either trade off dave's final rook or to lock  his bishop in place to protect it.  } f6 {(graderguy) f6: I have to protect against the mate in one. This attacks the Rook,  and might gain me a little time and space. Rc4 looks promising for later.  } 29. Rd5 {(dieselengine9) Rd5: attacks the bishop, and will have a nice home on d4 if needed.} Ba4 {(graderguy) Ba4: Attacks the rook and guards the space my passed pawn is heading for. I expect him move the rook to a1. At which point I might want to move Rc2.} 30. Rc1 {(dieselengine9) rc1:attacking his rook.} Bc2 {Bc2: this blocks the rook and protects the pawn form the queen. Contemplating  moving the rook along the c file somewhere...  have to see what this asstard does next..} 31. Qa2 {(dieselengine9) damn that bishop. Qa2. unpins my queen from my b pawn so rc5 can attack his remaining rook.  (editor)Surely Diesel notices the sweet discovered check when he moves the rook. My move must address that!} Kh8 {I have to avoid the discovered check, or rish losing my queen!} 32. Qa3 {He _claims_ he could think of nothing else to do.  } h6 { (graderguy) h6: My king needs a flight square in order for me to utilize my rook anywhere  besides guarding the back rank. I also need to dislodge that rook from the D-file to advance my pawn.} 33. Rc5 {(dieselengine9) Rc5: I'm honestly lost, and it looks pretty hopeless for stopping that pawn  promotion. I'll resign before I give this asshat that much satisfaction, but for now I'm going  to try to get him to trade his last rook.} Rd8 {(graderguy) Rd8: The pawn is nearly home free. I expect some sort of attack on  my queen or the hanging, lonely a-pawn.  } 34. Rc5xc2 {(dieselengine9) Rxc2!  yeah, I added the !, I added it in respect to everything and everyone that is good,  everything and everyone that is right...in otherwords...everything ANTIgraderguy.  f*** that D pawn, thats what I say. f*** graderguy and every D pawn he'll ever have.  This puts us back even in material, but it really takes the wind out of graderbitche's sails.  That's worth 3 or 4 points at least. (editor) I don't think he meant for all the asterisks to show up in his comment, I think  he was trying to say something about my "famous" d- pawn and my "fabulous" play. I even did some minor grammatical corrections, but he'll never notice...} dxc2 {(graderguy) dxc2: my next move will be Rd1 } 35. Rxc2 {(dieselengine9) rxc2: bring it b****. (editor) he's getting sort of hateful now. } Rd1+ {(graderguy) Rd1 : It's check. Check is good, right.  Too bad queen isn't on b8 or c7.........} 36. Kh2 {(dieselengine9) kh2: only legal move.  } Qd6+ {(graderguy) Qd6: I like check. Lots!!!  } 37. g3 {(dieselengine9) g3: dave is a fayge (editor) Fayge is a Gaelic word for "awesome chess player".} f5 {(graderguy) f5: I hope he'll bag the a pawn. Bad things are in store if he does.  } 38. Qa5 {(dieselengine9) Qa5. I forgot where I was or what I was thinking after a long race  weekend. I was tempted to take that pawn, but I had a bad feeling something bad would  be in store if I took it.  } Qf6 {(graderguy) Qf6: I can't let my f-pawn go just yet. This also guards A1 and wouldn't it be  awesome to get my queen (somehow) to f3? Rook to a1 wouldn't suck too bad either.} 39. Rc5 {(dieselengine9) rc5. if it's that valuable, it warrants an attack.  } Rd2 {(graderguy) Rd2: This pins his f pawn to the king and will allow a check if he takes my f pawn.  It might also lose me the game. if only I knew what diesel was thinking! I see him  having a wonderful mating opportunity if he can get his queen on f5 and check with the  queen on the back rank.} 40. Kg2 {both players were drink for this move and the next.} Qg5 41. Rxf5 {(dieselengine9) Rxf5: trades his f pawn for my useless e pawn  } Qe7 {(graderguy) Qe7: Dumb plan dave. checkmate ill be welcome relief. had ia taken the e pawn, it would have been mate in three: rf1 kh7 qf5 g6 qf7   (crap!)} 42. Re5 {dieselengine9) Re5: attacks the queen and the e pawn at the same time  } Qf7 { (graderguy) Qf7: crap crap crap now running like a little girl. (I am really eyeing f2, but doo-doo head is being kind of cagey, so I'm not telling him ALL  I'm thinking about..)} 43. Rf5 {(dieselengine9) Rf5: blocks the x of my f2 pawn.  } Qd7 {(graderguy) Qd7:crap. have I mentioned that lately? keeping my queen pointing  at f5 -- if his queen gets there, I am sunk...} 44. Rf4 {(dieselengine9) Rf4: still working on that e-pawn  } Rd5 {(graderguy) Rd5:OK, we'll try an attack from _this_ side of the board.  } 45. Qa6 {(dieselengine9) Qa6. moves the queen and keeps me in play for pressure on his king.  } Qb5 {(graderguy) qb5: hoping to trade queens and win the b pawn. Maybe.  } 46. Qg6 {(dieselengine9) Qg6: I will never tell why I made this move. (editor)That's the spirit!} Rg5 {(graderguy) Rg5: Trying to keep the queen moving and out of my king's face.  } 47. Rf8# {Graderguy should have opened his eyes and noted that his queen was _not_ guarding f8...  Rd8 might have saved him... what a dumbbunny}
