[Opening "Sicilian (B20), Keres variation (2.Ne2)"]

1. e4 c5 2. Ne2 {An idea of Paul Keres.  This can still transpose into 'normal' open lines, but leaves open the possibility of entering a Closed Sicilian instead.  Of course, such finesses are lost on a computer...} Nf6 {... or are they?  This can still lead to a version of Alekhine's Defence with 3.e5!? but then probably the Knight would have been better placed at f3!} 3. d3 {Definitely going for a Closed Sicilian.  The aim is a slower sort of game than the Open variety, with a King-side build-up.} Nc6 4. g3 e5 {White is clearly aiming for f2-f4 at some early point.  Black contests this plan.} 5. Bg2 {The f-pawn thrust is to wait upon White's developing his K-side.} Bd6 {(?!) An odd move, clearly intended to inhibit f2-f4.  But that bishop is very awkwardly placed it seems to me.} 6. Nbc3 O-O 7. Nb5 {(!?) A 'try-on'.  The bishop will have to move, constituting a loss of time for Black.  Of course White will lose time too, as the Knight will be driven off sooner or later by ...a6.} Be7 {releasing some of the pressure against f4.} 8. O-O d6 {A desirable move would have been ...d5, but that is not really feasible here on account of 8...d5  9.exd5 Nxd5?  10.Bxd5 Qxd5  11.Nc7 etc.  This more circumspect advance sensibly closes up the centre.} 9. f4 {The long-awaited break!} Be6 {This rather induces White's reply.  If 9...exf4, I was considering 10.gxf4, with a broad pawn front.} 10. f5 {Releases the tension in the centre, but heralding a general pawn advance on the K-side.} Bd7 11. h3 {Preparing g3-g4, Ng3, g5 and h4.} Qa5 {Attacking the loose knight.  My first thought was to retreat the knight at once, but first, why not close the centre altogether?  In fact, given my planned K-side operations, such closure is just about mandatory.} 12. c4 Qb4 {(??) Already the decisive blunder.  Black must now lose his Queen.  How...?} 13. Bd2 {By giving up the b-pawn!  Black's Queen has but one move...} Qxb2 14. Bc3 {Curtains for the Black Queen, which has no safe moves.  She sells her life for what it may fetch...} Qxa1 {Containing the damage to the major exchange.  But Black is now lost.} 15. Bxa1 {Possibly taking with the Queen was slightly better.  It will take two moves to bring this bishop into effective action.} a6 16. Nbc3 {(?!) Inefficient.  16.Nc7 was slightly better.} b5 {Such slender prospects there are for Black must lie on the Q-side.  It is no good awaiting White's attack: Black must do something positive.} 17. Nd5 {Forcing an exchange.} Nxd5 18. cxd5 Nd4 {Inviting an exchange that White is happy to accept.  The alternatives were to leave the knight passively placed.} 19. Nxd4 {(?!) Played with insufficient thought.  Possibly taking with the bishop was preferable, the knight being better placed to take a more active part in the game.} cxd4 {Opens the c-file for Black's rooks.} 20. g4 {Resuming K-side operations.} Bg5 {Aiming for e3.} 21. Bb2 Be3+ {Mildly annoying, but the bishop won't be staying there long.} 22. Kh1 f6 {Not a very good move as White could have won the d-pawn here.} 23. Bc1 {(?!) Forcing the exchange of dark-square bishops.  Objectively better, though, was 23.Ba3!} Bxc1 24. Qxc1 Rfc8 {Seizing the open file.  Black is fighting hard, keeping the other rook in the theatre where is is likely to do the most good, but the Queen is far handier than a rook.} 25. Qd2 a5 {'Hoping' - insofar as a computer program can 'hope' - to obtain a passed pawn.  But it seems to me 25...Rc3 would have been more promising.} 26. h4 {Now White can devote his energies to a direct attack upon the King.} b4 27. g5 fxg5 28. Qxg5 {It was very tempting to take with the pawn, but I have plans for the opened up g-file.} Be8 29. f6 {Threatens an immediate mate.} Rc7 30. Bh3 {Heading for e6.  Black can not challenge this with his own bishop to d7 or f7 owing to the threatened mate.} g6 31. Be6+ {This attack is deadly.  Black's defensive resources will soon run out...} Bf7 {Best.  31...Kh8  32.f7 was terminal.} 32. Qh6 {Note how White gains ground by using short-range threats.  Black can hold out for a while, but soon must crack.} Bxe6 33. dxe6 {Threatens mate in four, beginning with 34.f7ch.} Kh8 34. e7 {Good enough, but 34.f7 was better, with this mate in mind: 34.f7  Rcc8  35.f8=Rch Rxf8  36.Rxf8ch Rxf8  37.Qxf8#.} Rxe7 35. fxe7 Re8 36. Rf8+ Rxf8 37. exf8=R# {The ending after 34.f7 would have been more economical.  However, such interest that this game contains lies in the consequences of an ill-considered raid to snaffle a b-pawn.}
