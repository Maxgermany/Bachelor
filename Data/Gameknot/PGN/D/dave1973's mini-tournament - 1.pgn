1. d4 {Here is yet another game from dave1973's mini-tournament! The interesting endgame here, as well as the wacky opening, makes this game well worth looking at!} d5 2. c3 {This must be pretty rare. It is a passive, slow move that does absolutely nothing for White. If you're going to move that pawn, just play 2.c4, a much better opening for White - the Queen's Gambit.} c6 {Even more unbelieveable - Black responds in kind! Has anyone seen this opening before?} 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. Nd2 e6 {I have so far seen no reason for both sides' moving the c-pawn. Both sides could have got to this position without it...} 5. Qa4 Nf6 6. Qb3 {White wastes two moves with his queen. Perhaps a little education in basic opening principles would come in handy...} b5 7. a4 Qa5 8. Ra2 {The ROOK comes FORWARD????? What kind of openinng is White up to?} Nbd7 9. axb5 Qxb5 10. e3 Qxb3 11. Nxb3 Be7 {Let's face it, both sides have developed pretty oddly. White's idea of a good opening is to fiddle aroud with his queen and waste a move with his rook, while Black's pawn formation looks rather weak.} 12. Ra6 Nb8 {The thing is that White could have got his rook here without that initial rook move. And now Black's knight goes back to its original square. If anyone knows a good book on opening principles I will recommend it to both players.} 13. Ra1 {And back again. After THREE moves the rook is back where it started.} Ne4 14. Bxb8 Rxb8 15. Nd2 Nxd2 16. Kxd2 Rxb2+ {By now the board has rather cleared up, and Black has gained a foothold in White's undeveloped position.} 17. Ke1 c5 18. Rxa7 cxd4 19. exd4 {The opening goes straight into an endgame!} Rb1+ 20. Ke2 Bd6 21. f3 O-O {Black is taking advantage of White's poor development - just look at White's pieces stuck on the kingside!} 22. g4 Bd3+ 23. Kxd3 Rxf1 {Black exchanges a developed piece for an undeveloped piece.} 24. Ke2 Rc1 25. Kf2 Rxc3 26. Ne2 Rc2 27. Rha1 {Black's king is beleaguered...but on the other hand White's rooks are powerfully placed down the a-file...} Bxh2 28. Ra7a8 {White is clearly after 28...Rxa8 29.Rxa8  . Is this likely? No...} Bd6 29. Ra8a6 {...but White has other attacks in mind.} Be7 30. Ke3 e5 {Opening up the centre.} 31. dxe5 Bg5+ 32. f4 Be7 33. Nd4 Bc5 34. Kd3 Rg2 35. Nb3 Rg3+ {The battle continues, and the position is hard to call...} 36. Kc2 Be3 37. Na5 Rg2+ 38. Kd3 Bxf4 {Perhaps Black should bring his other rook and king into the action. Otherwise White sort of has a material advantage.} 39. Nc6 h6 40. Kd4 Rxg4 41. Kxd5 Bg5 42. Rf1 f6 43. Ne7+ Kh8 {Black's king retreats instead of coming out. Perhaps he would otherwise have won...} 44. Ng6+ {Oops! Black has made a large error!} Kg8 45. Nxf8 Kxf8 46. e6 {Now Black is decidedly behind - he is an exchange down and is threatened by a passed pawn.} Ke8 47. Re1 f5 {But Black has several passed pawns of his own.} 48. Kd6 Rd4+ 49. Ke5 Rf4 50. Kd5 Bf6 51. Rb1 Rd4+ 52. Kc5 {Chasing White's king away.} Rd8 53. Rb7 Be7+ 54. Kc6 {White's pieces are swarming in, but the game is still uncertain.} f4 55. Kc7 f3 {Well, it WAS uncertain. Now Black's pawns look likely to succeed in their advance...} 56. Rb8 f2 {The Charge of the Light Brigade! That pawn is not going to stop!} 57. Rb1 Rd2 58. Ra8+ Bd8+ 59. Kc6 {Black has saved his king...and can now concentrate on the pawn...} Ke7 60. Rf1 Rd6+ 61. Kb5 Rd2 62. Kc4 Bb6 63. Kc3 Rd6 64. Rb8 Bd4+ 65. Kc4 Kxe6 {White's last pawn is obliterated.} 66. Rg8 g5 67. Rg6+ Bf6 68. Rxf2 {Oops! Exit Black's pawn...but he has other pawns...} Ke5 69. Rxh6 Rc6+ 70. Kd3 Rd6+ 71. Ke2 g4 72. Rg6 g3 73. Rf3 {73.Rxg3 would lead to 73..Bh4, capturing one of the rooks, leading to a drawn King and Rook vs King and Rook endgame.} Bh4 74. Rg4 g2 75. Rxg2 Rd8 76. Re3+ Kf4 77. Rh2 Bg3 78. Rh7 {Black's pawns are all dead, but he is only an exchange down...} Rg8 79. Rf7+ Kg4 80. Ref3 Re8+ 81. Kf1 Kh3 {Black is after 82...Re1  } 82. Kg1 Kg4 83. Kg2 Re2+ 84. Kg1 Kh3 {White's king would be trapped without the assistance of his two rooks.} 85. Rh7+ Kg4 86. Rf8 Re1+ 87. Rf1 Re2 88. Rg7+ Kh3 89. Rgf7 {Notice how the game is being compressed around one quarter of the board.} Rg2+ {And now the game is drawn. Thanks to White's rook on f1 blocking White's king in, Black now has a perpetual check.}
