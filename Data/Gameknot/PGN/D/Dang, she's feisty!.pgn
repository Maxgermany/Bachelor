[Opening "Reti (A07), King's Indian attack (Barcza system)"]

1. Nf3 {We start with the Reti Opening. } d5 {I reply with this- I've also found Nf6 to be equally effective...} 2. g3 {Instead of continuing the Reti via c4, so that White can contest Black's ability to own the centre (a reason I find Reti games a bit scary to deal with at times), he instead goes into a King's Indian Attack, planning to fianchetto the bishop right away.} c6 {I decide to undermine the incoming fianchetto.} 3. Bg2 {Which he still performs.} Nf6 {More development. I'm a bit relaxed at his reluctance to push pawns.} 4. O-O {And now he castles. Once again, I'm not complaining- should White try to contest d5 right away, it is well defended. However, if White doesn't try to gain space with pawns soon, I'll gain the initiative sooner or later...} Bg4 {White's Nf3 is a lot stronger than his Bg2. So this is a nice neat way to threaten a pin if he decides to budge the e pawn, but also allows me to kill the knight if I decide I hate it too much. } 5. d3 {This might appear passive at first glance, but it makes e4 and c4 to be much stronger moves by White- and it also brings his dark bishop into the game.} Nbd7 {I want to play e5, but if I do that now, he just plays Nxe5.} 6. Qe1 {But I'm not sure why he wanted the queen here instead of the rook. I don't think the Bg4 pin should be that frightening for White- if it was, then I think he should have played h3...} e5 {This pawn is now secure, and I'm able to stake a claim into the centre.} 7. e4 {I think White's planning to open the files up so that the Queen starts hitting my King, but I don't think the plan is going to work unless I decline the exchange.} dxe4 {Which I don't. I have enough to fight with on the e4 square.} 8. dxe4 {He takes back, and now I hold the first move.} Be7 {This preemptively removes the threat of Bg5, and now I can castle. Black appears to be very solid right now, and it would seem White will have to scramble to find a secure way into my defenses. Black's pieces are almost developed, whereas White's queenside remains largely untouched...} 9. b3 {Perhaps he felt that way too. So he moves to open a second fianchetto on b2.} O-O {I castle before White can further any development.} 10. Bb2 {And White continues his plan.} Bxf3 {Now, for this... I'm sure there was plenty else Black could have done at this point. I personally didn't believe the light bishop was terribly frightening, but the Nf3 was weakening my e5 control rapidly. As it would turn out, it was never going to be the light bishop to cause me so much grief, so all in all, I think this was probably the right call in the long run.} 11. Bxf3 {The exchange is forced, and I get the initiative again.} Re8 {I start my battle for the e file, and subtly begin targeting the White Queen.} 12. Nd2 {The knight moves here to defend e4, without blocking the bishop if he instead played Nc3. } a5 {I was trying to search for a way to continue a plan into the kingside, but that part of the board looks fairly solid right now. So I begin a plan to dominate this part of the board.} 13. Nc4 {I was a bit surprised by this move- I didn't expect White to hate where the knight was this much. So now I started wondering if he was going to target e5...} b5 {I move here. I thought that if Nxe5, Nxe5, and then Bxe5, I can play Bb4! White's dark bishop would now be in an awkward place, and I was sure I could continue attacking- if he plays Bxf6, then Qxf6 will stop White from playing c3 against Bb4, and if he played c3 right away, then Rxe5, cxb4, axb4, Qxb4 would lead to me restoring equality after I play Qd3. The bishop retreats, and the knight could capture on e4, giving me three strong centralized pieces, staring down White's Queen and King.} 14. Ne3 {Of course, I don't think I saw all that in the heat of the moment. I wonder if White saw more, or if he simply just wanted a better square for his knight all along. :P} Bf8 {I think I finally settled for this move because I wanted to play ...b4, but I also wanted the rook to come back into the game by helping e5. This move gave me multiple back-rank defenders, and even a defense to g7, if I needed it against his Bb2...} 15. Rd1 {And I'd say right around here begins the turning point of the game. Each move White played after this, for the next 15 turns, made me start to see how exploitable my defenses were at this point. And no matter how badly I'd try to fix the position, I could never fully shut down the threats; it took nearly the entire rest of the match for me to secure my defenses to finish the attacks I planned.} Qc7 {I hate pinning knights to queens. Here seemed to be a good spot- it helps guard the knight from the d1 rook, guards e5 again, or guards f7. Again- I was very confident that my defenses were solid, but in retrospect, this somehow became a very annoying square for the queen to be on...} 16. Bg2 {The bishop retreats, still defending e4, but allowing the f2 pawn to be freed.} h6 {I plan a home for the f6 knight, allowing my own f pawn to be playable.} 17. Qe2 {White's Queen suddenly moves here. Now I'm wondering why White did it- did he see another hole in his own defenses, or is he looking for a better square for the queen?} a4 {I think my kingside defenses are solid once again; I resume my queenside attack, planning ...a3.} 18. b4 {He doesn't want to exchange, because if bxa4, then both bxa4 or Rxa4 would allow me to continue attacking that side of the board. But this is still a mistake...} Bxb4 {White now has some serious issues on this side of the board.} 19. f4 {All of a sudden, this move appears. It's an extremely aggressive move- the knight can be pinned via both Bc5 or Qb6, but all of those moves are a tempo behind White's. Also, I don't want to exchange my back rank pieces- they're powerful, and I don't want to lose them to undermine the others...} exf4 {As far as the pawn is concerned, I need it gone, so I throw my e5 away.} 20. Rxf4 {Of course, this is playable, but I was still surprised to see the rook come before the other pawn.} Bd6 {So my bishop comes to drive it away.} 21. Rg4 {And then White sacs the rook!!! I was shocked by this move, and then slowly, I realized what this move would start doing to my kingside. I see the bishop on b2, and then I see my own bishop no longer guarding g7. If I take that rook, I must be prepared to defend immediately.} Nxg4 {After a long, careful think, I decided I would contest the material disadvantage against my defenses.} 22. Qxg4 {Qxg4 - threatening Qxg7#. Suddenly, the Rd1 and Ne3 pieces are looking more terrifying as the game draws on. I can't play Bf8 anymore, because if I do that, then Rxd7 wins back the material, and the Queen would have to move. } g6 {GK doesn't like this move, saying that Ne5 would have solved my problems better. Still, I just didn't want to have to keep worrying about Qxg7 anymore. While this won't stop the knight from coming in, it will at least push the queen back for a few turns. } 23. Qh4 {"Pushing the queen BACK" was the correct phrase. She doesn't have to retreat. h6 is now under attack, but if I'm careless about my defenses, I notice that my knight is stuck on d7, (or else Qf6 fcd mate!) and my queen is stuck doing nothing while White continues pressuring me more and more...} h5 {I really thought about Be5, and I wanted to play it, but then I saw that when the exchange finishes, White ends it with Qxh6, and I thought that if I let the Queen rest in front of my King, it would eventually prove fatal after some drawn out combination of moves that would lead into the endgame. I felt this was a slightly safer alternative.} 24. Qg5 {So White goes here, threatening a simple Qh6. The knight can still come in from f5, and I was desperately grasping at how to stop that from happening.} Ne5 {Finally! The knight can move off of d7. It now blocks the terrifying Bb2 from allowing this pesky queen to terrorize my king any further, and I guard it three times still, way back when a pawn previously occupied that square.} 25. Kh1 {And then... he moves the king for some reason? I'm not entirely sure why- perhaps he thought the threats of Qb6 or Bc5 were more significant at this point? } Qd8 {The Queen can still trap my king via Qh6, but it will isolate itself from the rest of the White pieces if it chooses to do so. I was hopeful I could force capture if it tried to keep pressing the attack.} 26. Qf4 {Likewise, White didn't favor his chances either, so this feisty queen reluctantly retreats here.} Re6 {I knew, going in, that playing this would allow for Bh3. It would be a risk, but I thought that I had enough control after Rf6 to win whatever exchanges would happen after. All I could think at this point was, "if I just end the attack spearheaded by The Queen of Sass, I could regain control of the game!"} 27. Qf2 {To my surprise and relief, the Queen puts a halt to her sass and retreats again.} Rf6 {This move is even stronger now, and she must move again.} 28. Qe2 {The queen remains here, a core to White's defenses for the next bit of time, and I'm finally allowed to regain control of the game again. I need to play sharp, lest I allow White to harass my defenses again.} Qc7 {I want my queen to defend e5 again, just in case, but I also noticed that my Ra8 has zero influence in this game right now, and that will have to change immediately.} 29. g4 {White sees I'm trying to re-adjust my defenses, and tries to open my pawns up again.} h4 {I refuse. There's no way I'm letting The Queen of Sass back into my domain.} 30. g5 {Hitting my rook, and I can't retreat, or else Bh3 disrupts my defenses again.} Rf4 {So I push ahead, trying to buy enough time to figure out a better position.} 31. Bc1 {The bishop finally off b2, no longer a threat there- now allowing a discovered attack on the rook. } h3 {So I threaten a capture- with check, so he can't continue with the discovered attack.} 32. Bxh3 {Practically forced.} Rh4 {One last push... now I threaten Rxh3 and Rxe4, but I have a third plan in mind...!} 33. Qg2 {The Queen of Sass starts getting feisty with my rook again.} Rh7 {And my defenses snap shut again! This was a plan I had in motion since Rf4, knowing that I needed a rook to defend the f7 pawn after White plays Rf1. But if I retreated via Re6, then White's Bishop lands on h3, forcing this rook onto f7, blocking the other rook from defending with my Queen. This is a much better spot for the rook, as it guards f7, while threatening White if he dare moves the Queen of Sass- he could lose the bishop.} 34. Rf1 {Even though my defenses are working again, this is a better spot for White's rook. I can't move my f pawn at all for the next bit of time.} Bc5 {I need to start using my material advantage, now that I've secured it. Between White's terrifying dark bishop, his potentially threatening knight, and his weak light bishop, I figure this is the exchange I can gain the most from.} 35. Ng4 {He wonders if I'll decline if my knight is instead at risk.} Nxg4 {And of course I won't. That knight was only stuck at e5 because my rook wasn't at h7- I'm much happier to keep the bishop!} 36. Qxg4 {So the Queen of Sass strengthens the light bishop and continues to guard h3-e4.} Bd6 {I also tie my bishop and queen, threatening winning h2 and pinning the bishop to the King.} 37. Rf2 {But this is now playable due to my bishop no longer on c5.} a3 {So I secure my queenside edge. If White lets me gain any more ground on this side of the board, a promotion threat will be almost totally unavoidable from this point on.} 38. Bf4 {White now believes it's worth his stronger bishop, if I lose control of my diagonals.} Bxf4 {I think he's wrong, threatening to punish the Queen of Sass if she gets feisty again...} 39. Rxf4 {If Qxf4, then I play Qxf4. After White plays Rxf4, then Rxh3...} Qa5 {-of course, if I had played Rxh3 right then, I would have seen Qxh3, and then I had Qxf4! I saw the first part of the line, but not the second! Thinking that I couldn't proceed with the attack anymore, I start focusing my attention on the king. Nice, but damn could that have been better!!!} 40. Rf2 {My queen threatens 3 squares: c3, d2, and e1. If White had played Rf1 here, anticipating the check, then Black had Qc3, guarenteeing that I at least win the c2 pawn, but probably the a2 pawn as well after a few checks. White could stop that from happening, but the result, I believed after enough checks, would wind up  my queen on the 3rd row, White defending the a2 pawn, but then I finish with Rxh3...} Qe1+ {So Rf2 was a good call, since it allows for this move...} 41. Kg2 {The King is now a h3 defender. I overlooked my attack, but it's far from over.} Qc3 {I start trying to target both a2 and h3 again.} 42. Qd7 {The Queen of Sass has had enough of my rudeness, and starts getting feisty with my f7 pawn again. Annoying is the fact that she can attack both f7 from here, while defending h3.} Qc4 {Threatening Qxa2, and Qxe4+.} 43. e5 {And it was probably a bad idea, because if that pawn hits e6, it's curtains for me.} Qe4+ {So I throw in a check, ensuring that the pawn is dropped. } 44. Kf1 {The king retreats here. I REALLY wanted to play Qh1+, but I saw that White had enough blockages to force a retreat- and I can't afford any more wasted tempo at this point.} Qxe5 {So I end the pawn while I still have the chance.} 45. Qxc6 {This finally buys The Queen of Sass enough time to start taking care of my queenside... } Re8 {This is forced, or else Qxa8+, ruining the day for me yet again. e1 has gotten weaker, however...} 46. Qd7 {And once again, The Queen of Sass gets feisty with the poor, probably-a-nice-guy f7 pawn.} Qe1+ {My Queen starts telling the White King off for not keeping his wife under control.} 47. Kg2 {He ignores her. Geez, how rude!} Qe4+ {I play this, still thinking that I can force the king out of hiding, but I forgot one minor detail...} 48. Kg1 {White can force a draw with this, or even block with Bf1, and there's not much I can do about it. If my Queen leaves the e-file now, then I lose after Qxe8+ again.} f5 {So I block The Queen of Sass from the bishop, demanding her to move out of the way again.} 49. Qd6 {And she gets feisty one final time with me. My next move needs to be played very carefully, because if I neglect the queen's influence of the game, then White simply forces a draw after Qxg6+ with perpetual checks. White's final attack- this time for a draw.} Qe7 {It took me almost two full days, but this was my response, threatening Qxg5+. GK instead suggests Re6, but after looking at that line, I saw an open back rank, and was sure that the Queen could still harass the king if I was careless enough to leave the back rank open.} 50. Qxg6+ {And all according to plan, The Queen of Sass enters what will be her final rant, getting feisty with my poor pawns, but ending her brutal reign in the process.} Rg7 {My rook gets in the way, and exploits the lack of defenses on g5 even more.} 51. Qxf5 {And White decides that it's time for the queens to move off the board.} Rxg5+ {I agree, so I spark the exchanges.} 52. Qxg5+ {The Queen of Sass is screaming up and down...} Qxg5+ {...and at long last, I finally silence her!} 53. Rg2 {Of course, my own queen has to make a valiant sacrifice.} Qxg2+ 54. Bxg2 {And it's going to be okay, since at long last, all that remains is my stronger Queenside edge, supported by a rook, against his selective bishop, who cannot defend a1 directly.} Re2 {Black should win by cutting off the King's ability to defend the kingside pawn.} 55. Bd5+ {So there's really only one sequence left for White after this check.} Kg7 {I'm forced to go here. White must play Bb3 now, or else either pawn will surpass White's pieces.} 56. c3 {He doesn't, so I just simply win a pawn after that blunder.} Rc2 {White must sacrifice one of the queenside pawns now, and the game is surely over.} 57. h3 Rxc3 {With my pawns much closer to promotion, and his King totally unavailable to defend the servants, White's game is lost, and resigns here. Interesting enough, after all the energy White had this match, my opponent revealed to me that he actually didn't intend to play Rg4! After all I went through this game, I was shocked, and told him that he probably made one of the best mistakes you could in this game. He was humbled, and I enjoyed how sharp this game was.
