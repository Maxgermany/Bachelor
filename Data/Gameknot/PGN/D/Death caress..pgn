1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 5. c4 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 {Not the worst. If Nc3, Ne4 puts inmediately white on the defensive. } a5 {The exchange favours me, but white...} 7. a3 {Losing the initiative with Be7 is out of question, so... } Bxd2+ 8. Qxd2 Ne4 {White has to keep guard of d4, and if Qd3, Bf5 has a threat (Ng3). } 9. Qd1 {Pressure, pressure, pressure... } Qf6 {Easy to parry, but still very good. I keep an eye on d4, now pinned against b2. } 10. Nf3 {Better than f3?? Qh4+, g3, Nxg3.} O-O {? g5 at once keeps the pressure on. } 11. Be2 {if white castles, I'll have it much more difficult. I don't care about my K this time, I have to attack. } g5 {...starting a tactic mel√©e that will come over later. } 12. Bd3 {A typical novice mistake. o-o and Ne5 would do much better. } Nxf2 {Let's party!} 13. Kxf2 g4 {I'll recover the piece, for sure, and white is not castled! And now, d4 will become vulnerable. } 14. Rf1 {The idea is to win a tempo over the Q after the way clears... and to start a pressure on the f column. } gxf3 15. Kg1 {Aha... you wan a tempo, but you didn't see mine: } Qxd4+ {White seems crushed, but... one never wins until the end. See my last game!} 16. Kh1 {I'm not sure of my next move. Take it that white has Bxh7+ and wins my Q, so f2 was not an option. I didn't see qxb2, but Nd2 and white holds a little more. No risks.} fxg2+ 17. Kxg2 Qh4 {This seemed to me a good square for my Q. I have to be very careful now, since the position is very easy for tactics, and I miss a tempo to move my K to h8... safely. I am only +1, so I didn't win yet. } 18. Qf3 {Threatening b7. I'm glad to leave it to him, but now if I play Kh8, Qf6+ exchanges Q with no further advantage for me. } Nd7 {! Covering f6. If Qxb7, Rb8, and then Rxb2+ wins. It threatens a "fork" on e5. A good "quiet move". } 19. Nc3 {White's quiet move is not so good!} Ne5 20. Qe2 {White could have played Qg3+, exchanging Q and get a playable endgame. I lost the chance to play Ng4 here, forcing Rh1. } Bh3+ {Now, I start cashing in. } 21. Kh1 {BxR is there, but... would it be all? I looked hard, but black has Rg1+ and I see no point in allowing it. Probably, white has some mate net if I get wrong, so...} Nxd3 {This B was my headache. } 22. Qxd3 Bxf1 23. Rxf1 {It was not the better outcome I could have organized, but I'm still and exchange up. An unactive R waits for his moment. } Kh8 {Now I can, finally, play the K there } 24. Nd5 {NO matter, white, you're doomed. } Rae8 25. Qc3+ {...or not! I allowed him to pressure f6 too much. Still, I have a way out of this. Can you see it?} f6 {It seems bad, because I can't defend it. But I have a "small" conterattack... bsed on Qe5+ and Rg8+...} 26. Rf4 {Stopped this one, but...} Re1+ 27. Kg2 Rg8+ 28. Kf3 Qh3+ 29. Kf2 Qf1# {}
