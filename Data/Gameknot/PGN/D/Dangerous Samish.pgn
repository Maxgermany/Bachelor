[Opening "King's Indian (E81), Saemisch, Byrne variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {Here playing black on the king indian defense in a blitz game. } 5. f3 {f3 announce the samish variation, white plan gonna be to attack my king side, so I have to be careful.} O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 e5 8. O-O-O exd4 {The main idea here was to create an open line for my bishop. I knew the opponent was going to exploit it too, but I thought my defense where more resilient. } 9. Bxd4 Nb6 {?! I was trying to counter into the middle, but finally I think an attack on the queen side would have been better. Now I can't freely move my b7 pawn.} 10. Kb1 {?! I think it was a waste of tempo at this time of the game. An immediate g4 would have been better I think.} Be6 11. Nd5 {! A solid move!} Bxd5 {I didn't wanted to lose my bishop and my knight on the king side to keep a descent defense for my king. Nbxd5 was not an option because I would end up with a very bad bishop.} 12. cxd5 {Now white have a pretty nice position. Black has no piece active at all and both knights are very bad placed.} a5 {Trying finally to attack on the queen side.} 13. g4 Nbd7 14. h4 {Black look pretty bad.} b6 15. h5 Nc5 16. hxg6 fxg6 17. Nh3 {Qh2! look pretty strong.} a4 18. Nf4 a3 {?} 19. b3 {?! There was a lot of better replies.} Nfxe4 {!! The only way for black to get out of this situation. Should have done it on the previous move. My time was pretty low at this point.} 20. fxe4 Bxd4 21. Qxd4 {21.Nxg6! Nxb3! 22.Qh6 Rf7 would have been a very nice variation.} Rxf4 {Now black have suddenly the advantage!} 22. Bd3 Rxg4 {! The winning move.} 23. Rxh7 {? Bad sacrifice. White try to swindle the game. I didn't seen this tactic, without Rxh7 I would have lost.} Kxh7 24. Rh1+ Rh4 {White resigned here.}
