[Opening "King's Indian (A48), East Indian defence"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Nc3 {White is avoiding mainline Indian openings, following more of a Colle/London path. I stick to my usual King's Indian formation.} Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. h3 {Boring, but prepares White's next.} O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 e5 8. d5 b6 {I don't usually go for a double fianchetto, so I think this was played to support ..Nc5, attacking e4.  Black's White squares on the Queenside are looking very weak now.} 9. Nh2 {This retreat appeared to have aggressive intent: an advance of f2-f4 or Ng4...} Nc5 10. f3 {or the more prosaic defensive move..} Ba6 {Black offers to swap off his problematic lsb, not really expecting the offer to be accepted.} 11. Bxa6 Nxa6 {The white squares look gaping now but hopefully not too important.} 12. Bg5 {White proceeds with his slow build-up against Black's castled king.} Nc5 {The N quickly returns from the edge of the board but to what purpose?} 13. h4 {Now White commits to a Kingside attack, happy to leave his King in the middle of the board behind his advanced wall of white-squared pawns.} Qe8 {A fairly standard manoeuvre, releasing the pin.  In this position there is also the longer term hope of action on the e-file.} 14. h5 Nxh5 {Even though this helps White to clear the file for his rook, I saw no compelling reason not ot play this now.  If I didn't take the pawn, it could advance to h6 embarrassing my dsb.} 15. Ng4 Nd7 {The much-travelled knight prepares to help with the defence.} 16. Nb5 {This gesture seemed relatively harmless, the threat to fork R & Q easily met.} Qc8 {Unfortunately the R couldn't defend c7 without giving up a7.  So the Q had to move away from the defence of the kingside...} 17. Bh6 f5 {Time to counter-attack and get some fresh air for King and Knight ...} 18. Bxg7 Kxg7 19. Qg5 {Now the Nh5 is looking a bit sick} Ndf6 {but this seemed to cover it.} 20. Nh6 {This move deprives my K of two important squares but doesn't seem to threaten anything.} fxe4 {So I continued my attempt to expose his King} 21. g4 {and White continued his assault on my King.} Nf4 22. Nf5+ {No the real point of 20. Nh6 is revealed.  The K is forced to move and there are forks in the air.} Kf7 {?? Black avoids the obvious fork of Kg8 and Qc8 but walks into the slightly less obvious one from d6, made possible by that "harmless" knight on b5.} 23. Nbxd6+ cxd6 24. Nxd6+ Ke7 25. Nxc8+ Raxc8 26. Qxe5+ {and, as the Nf4 was about to fall as well, I resigned.}
