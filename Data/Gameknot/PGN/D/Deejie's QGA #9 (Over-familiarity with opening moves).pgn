[Opening "QGA (D20), 3.e4"]

1. d4 {A game from one of my Queen's Gambit Accepted tournaments. First 2 moves are given: 1.d4,d5 2.c4,dxc4 ...then I regularly play 3.e4: Black forfeits the centre & so white occupies it. It seems also to be generally accepted that the advanced c-pawn can not be held. So most players of black concentrate on releasing their white bishop & developing.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 {My usual 3rd move - to occupy the centre, with a view to playing Nc3 & pawn to d5.} b5 {Well, I've read of a number of counters to this, the main one being...} 4. a4 Bb7 {a fiancietto-ed bishop doesn't usually hold up against the strong centre of QGA in my experience... unless you haven't build the centre yet:} 5. axb5 {...totally ignoring the unprotected e-pawn} Bxe4 {of course} 6. Nc3 {And finishing myself off: This move demonstrates the danger of over-confidence with a particular opening. One which I must have played a hundred times on Gameknot alone. Also, it highlights the importance of move order when playing d5. Good luck! Daniel} Nf6 7. Bxc4 Bxg2 {}
