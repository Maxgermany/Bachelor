1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 g6 3. Nf3 b6 {It started like a normal blitz, but black choosed an unusual setting. A very good one, indeed. } 4. c4 {I could have stuck to my scheme, but I felt I was too chicken not allowing black's pessure over the black diagonal. It was long ago I didn't play for it, so let's give it a try!} Bb7 5. d5 {Break this, black... :-)} d6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Qc2 {Already thinking in the diagonal. } c6 8. e4 cxd5 9. exd5 {Now, my queenside will become my weak wing, so I should have to castle kingside, and... the game will be a normal one. } O-O 10. Be2 {Well, let's prepare someting on e2-h5. No risk, no win. } Na6 {Yeah, of course. Here he comes. } 11. a3 {My chessistic experience (however good) told me that I can have a confident try in resisting black's pressure on the queenside. Let's see if it is true. } Nc5 12. O-O-O {!? Right into the danger. But the support the rook gives to the center will be helpful.} Nh5 {Thank you, black, you make me win tempoes for g4 - in the agenda.} 13. Be3 {Contesting the center, specially d4, and keeping in mind the possibility of an exchange. My bishop can't leave the diagonal controlling h6.} f5 {Interesting reaction by black. Now his attack on the queenside is momentarily stopped. Good. } 14. Ng5 {I though hard to Nd4, probably better. I admit I was tempting him. } h6 {He took the bite. } 15. Ne6 {What a way to lose an attack! But I thought this little pawn in e6 would have had a future. It hadn't. If BxN, black can go hxN, and it is hard to analyze. } Nxe6 16. dxe6 Nf6 {Wise, since BxN was coming. I don't care at all if black does me the favour to take Bxg2. } 17. Qd2 {Boldily treatening h6. } Qc8 {Black dares not to defend it. The central pawn bothers him a lot. } 18. Bxh6 Qxe6 {Now, the way is open for my rooks. } 19. Rde1 {Threatening in an unusual way.} Ne4 20. Nxe4 Bxe4 21. f3 Bb7 {Should have Black tried BxBh6?} 22. Bxg7 Kxg7 23. Bd3 Qf6 {Now, black is more or less under control. I have to take my chance. } 24. h4 Rac8 {Underestimating the danger... but setting a nice threat for the future. } 25. h5 Ba6 {Black is trying to beating me at my own style. This is becoming very fun. } 26. hxg6 {Not really sure about it, but I had to act in the quickiest way I could.} Qxg6 {A sad decision by black, because of...} 27. Rxe7+ Rf7 {Still, black is not completely busted, still. It was really funny to try to find the good way to win on a blitz...} 28. Bxf5 {I would tell that this is one of my best quick-thinkings ever. } Rxc4+ 29. Kd1 {"...and now what?", like they say in clubs... Black has to find a move, but he is also pressed by time, and overlooks, and plays QxB. After this, Qh6+ and mate on the next. But... had ever blak another move to find? I tried...} Rxe7 30. Bxg6 Kxg6 {Despite the firepower, black has not a direct way to attack white easily. } 31. Rh6+ {Better than Qh6+, even if it would have won all the same. } Kf7 32. Qxd6 {Again, black is resourceless. White threats mate. } Rc1+ {The only move I have seen able to stop the mate. } 33. Kxc1 Re1+ 34. Kd2 Re2+ 35. Kc3 Re3+ 36. Kb4 {The checks are over, white wins. }
