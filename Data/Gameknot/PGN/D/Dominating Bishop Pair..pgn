1. e4 {I play as black. This a standard.} e5 2. Bc4 {Targeting f7.} Nf6 3. d3 d5 {I try to open the center.} 4. exd5 Nxd5 5. Qf3 {I expected Bxd5, leaving me with a satisfactory center, but this, I believe, is a better move.} Be6 6. h4 {Maybe planning Bg5 in the future.} Nc6 {Saw 7....e4 8.dxe4 Ne5!, but forgot he could take with his Queen.} 7. a3 {I think that this is a weak move, but since we were in the calm before the storm, this might be the only chance he has to play it for a long time.} Qf6 {I did not like the potential pin on the a2-g8 diagonal, so opt to trade Queen. However, I would receive the butt end of that trade, since I'd have doubled pawns.} 8. Bxd5 {Alrighty, I'll trade Queens!} Qxf3 9. Bxf3 {Regrettably, I am down the exchange by a Knight.} Na5 {Trying to avoid a trade and guard the b7 square...bad move.} 10. b4 {And I'm forced back to the only open square.} Nc6 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. c4 c5 13. b5 {I don't like that passed pawn...} a6 14. Bb2 axb5 15. cxb5 {Now I've got the potential passed pawn chain (PPPC) down to two.} Bd6 {Maybe stronger was Ra4.} 16. a4 O-O 17. Nf3 c4 18. d4 exd4 19. Nxd4 {I don't wan't to lose my Bishop pair.} Bd5 20. O-O Be5 {Pinning the Knight.} 21. Nc6 {Ne7+ Forks King and Bishop.} Bxb2 22. Ra2 {?? Blunder. He should have forked and then moved here, then he'd be forking both of my Bishops. } Bf6 {Here he messaged me saying that he should have forked me first. Material is now even.} 23. Rd2 {Attacking the Bishop.} Be6 24. a5 {Yuck, yuck, yuck.} Bxh4 25. g3 Bg5 26. f4 {Now his King is vulnerable.} Bf6 27. Rfd1 {Not much of a threat.} Bg4 28. Rc1 Rfe8 {If he takes, I fork his King and useless Knight.} 29. Rxc4 Re1+ 30. Kf2 Rxb1 31. a6 Rb3 32. Ne5 {Now I can't stop him from queening without losing material.} Bxe5 33. fxe5 Rf3+ 34. Kg2 h5 35. Rxc7 {It's all or nothing now. I push on.} g5 36. a7 h4 37. b6 Rxg3+ {Here it goes:} 38. Kf2 Rf3+ 39. Ke1 Re3+ {Here, he timed out. Who do you think would have won?}
