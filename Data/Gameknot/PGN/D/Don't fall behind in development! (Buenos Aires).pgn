[Round "1"]
[White "Pleci, Isaias (?)"]
[Black "Endzelins, Lucius (?)"]
[Opening "French (C10), Rubinstein, Capablanca line"]

1. e4 e6 {The French defense -- which usually leads to closed lines.} 2. d4 d5 {The strong point of the French -- protect it, capture it, advance it -- but don't ignore it!} 3. Nc3 {White chooses to protect it.} dxe4 {The Rubenstein variation.  Not as common as Bb4 (the Winawer) or Nf6 (the Classical), but this move forces the knight to move twice in the opening.} 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 c5 {?!  This move opens lines, but is black ready for this?} 6. dxc5 {Clearing the knight out of d7 has a consequence that black overlooked -- each of the next FOUR white moves helps his development, with check...} Nxc5 {Unbelievably, this turns out to be the LOSING move.  Qc7, I believe, would have minimized white's advantage.} 7. Qxd8+ {Black loses the right to castle, and his king winds up on an open file...} Kxd8 {Forced.} 8. Bg5+ {Developing, with check.} f6 {It may look like Be7 or Nf6 would have been a slightly better try, getting *something* developed, but Be7 leaves the c5 knight hanging, and Nf6 fails to 9. Nxf6 gxf6 10. Bxf6 , winning the rook!} 9. O-O-O+ {White develops even further, again with check...} Ke8 {Again, not Ke7, which hangs the Nc5.} 10. Bb5+ {The *fourth* move in a row that develops with check. } Kf7 11. Rd8 {White now has a dominant position.  Note that if black plays fxg5, white has Ne5 ! followed by Re8#!} Be7 {Better than Nxe4, where white plays Ne5  anyway, and fxe5 would be met with Be8#!} 12. Ne5+ {!  This knight sacrifice forces black to play fxe5, leaving his king with nowhere to hide.} fxe5 13. Nd6+ {!} Kg6 {The knight still cannot be captured, as Bxd6 would lead to 14. Be8 ! Kf8 15. Bg6#} 14. Bxe7 {...and now white not only wins back the sacrificed material...} Nxe7 15. Rxh8 {...but wins the exchange as well, while retaining a dominant position AND a strong attack.  Black is busted.} a6 {Black is trying to get those last two pieces into the game...} 16. Be2 {While white plays to mate the defenseless black king.} e4 {?  Black may be lost anyway, but what is the point of this move??  He should've played b5, which would at least have been consistent.} 17. f4 {If black leaves this pawn alone, this move prevents black's king from running anywhere onto the 5th rank.} b5 {Should have played this last move I think.  But, as Def Leppard says, "But it's too late..."} 18. Re8 {<wah-waaah wah-waaah!>} Kf6 {"too late..." (protecting the knight; note that if the knight moves instead, the Bc8 falls)} 19. Rf8+ {<wah-WAAH!> (forces the king back to g6)} Kg6 {"too late..." (forced)} 20. h4 {<wah-wa-da-daaaah>} Bb7 {?  "TOO LATE FOR LOVE!"  Oblivious to the nasty threat contained in h4; black's best hope was to play h5.} 21. h5+ {! Black resigns, 1-0.  Black has only one legal move, and after Kh6, 22. Nf7 is mate.  Truly a punishing lesson on the dangers of falling behind in development!}
