[Opening "Van't Kruijs opening (A00)"]

1. e3 {The game starts with a strange opening. Black usually responds with e5, but having not seen this move before, I went with my gut (and apparently it was saying e6). From what I heard, white normally will go for a fianchetto with b3 and then attack the center with f4, much like the bird opening only in a different series of moves.} e6 {This would also have been my response to e4. The "correct" response would have been e5 to attack the center, but that wasn't what I wanted to do this game.} 2. b3 {As I mentioned earlier, the fianchetto is usually the key to this opening.} d5 {One of many playable moves.} 3. Bb2 {White now controls the diagonal. At the moment the bishop can't be stopped, but it isn't a threat yet.} Nf6 {Continues development. c5 was also playable.} 4. Bxf6 {It may seem like an even trade, but this trade is anything but even. White is trading a very strong bishop for the knight which wasn't as strong. Not only that, black now can develop his queen while attacking the rook. As said multiple times, f4 was much better. } Qxf6 {gxf6 was also good, but I prefer Qxf6.} 5. Nc3 {The best move. All other moves were weaker.} Bb4 {Places more pressure on the knight. The only move is to move the knight away or...} 6. Nge2 {...To defend it with the other knight. I find this move weak since both the bishop and queen will be stuck since the knight is blocking them.} c5 {Attacking the center and after a3, the bishop can stay on a5.} 7. d4 {A good counter attack that keeps the game even. Whites position is very good now, except for the pawn at b3 which weakens the knight.} Nc6 {developing} 8. Qd3 {Here the queen is developed and the knight is protected.} O-O {development} 9. dxc5 {I could have let the pawn go and continue developing, but I didn't.} Bxc5 {Regaining the pawn.} 10. Nf4 {It's a great place for the knight, but it gets easily chased away after a few moves. Right now, e5 loses a pawn and g5 leaves the king defenceless later.} Bd7 {Develops the bishop and opens the c-file for the rooks. I understand that Bb4 was probably better.} 11. O-O-O {This was the losing move of the game. The best possible result for white is to let the knight go, and pray for a draw. Of course if black doesn't see the winning move, the game would be much different. Do you see the winning move?} Nb4 {This is the only move that gives black a huge advantage. Like I said earlier, the best move is to let the knight go (with Qe2). } 12. Qd2 {Yes it protects the knight, but this move only makes things worse. With one move, white will lose everything. Do you see the winning move? } Nxa2+ {With a simple sacrifice, white will have to let go of the knight and now the rook, unless white makes another mistake. } 13. Kb2 {The other two lines are much worse than this move.} Nxc3 {The obvious move, unless black wants to give away a huge advantage.} 14. Qxc3 {The final mistake from white before waving the white flag. Once again, one move will win the game. Do you see it? (I bet higher rated players will see the correct move before reading any of this.)} Ba3+ {The move that wins the queen. There is absolutely no way to prevent losing the queen. Taking the bishop is the "best" move. All other moves are deadly as well. White resigned here, since there is no way to recover.}
