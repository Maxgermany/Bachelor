1. d4 d5 {A Double Queen Pawn opening } 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Black plays symmetrically. } 3. c4 dxc4 {A Queen's Gambit Accepted } 4. g3 {The computer considers this a mistake. Best was e3. } Be6 {Protecting the pawn from Qa4+ } 5. Bg2 Bd5 {... Nc6 was better than moving the bishop a second time. } 6. Nc3 Bc6 7. O-O e6 8. Re1 {Preparing e4 } Bb4 9. Bg5 {Here, Black should castle. } Bxc3 {This reinforces White's center, but shields the advanced Black c-pawn. } 10. bxc3 Nbd7 11. e4 h6 12. Bxf6 Nxf6 13. d5 {White has the advantage, even though he is down a pawn. } Bd7 14. Nd4 {Qd4 is better. } e5 15. Nf3 Qe7 16. Nxe5 {This sacrifice is unsound, according to Fritz. } Qxe5 17. f4 Qxc3 18. e5 {Here, Black should castle queenside. However, I was concerned about the weakness on b7, so I decided to go the other way. } O-O 19. Rc1 Qd3 {If Qxd3, then recapturing with the pawn threatens to fork both rooks. } 20. exf6 Qxd1 {... Rae8 was better. } 21. Rexd1 b5 22. d6 c6 23. Rde1 {White must not let Black control the open file, else Black will have a big advantage. } gxf6 {Black's pawn structure is a mess, but it is hard for White to exploit it. } 24. Re7 Rad8 25. Kf2 a6 26. a3 Be6 {... Bf5 was better because the bishop can go to d3. } 27. Rd1 c3 28. d7 Bxd7 {... Rxd7! is even better. } 29. Rc1 Rfe8 {Forcing a pair of rooks off the board } 30. Rxe8+ Bxe8 31. Rxc3 Rd2+ 32. Kg1 Ra2 {... a5 was best. } 33. Bxc6 Bxc6 34. Rxc6 Rxa3 35. Rb6 Kg7 36. Kf2 Ra4 37. Ke3 b4 38. Kd4 a5 39. Kc4 Ra2 40. Rb5 Rxh2 {Black abandons the queenside to attack White's kingside. } 41. Rxa5 Rg2 42. Kxb4 Rxg3 43. Ra1 Rg4 44. Rf1 Kg6 45. Kc3 h5 46. Kd3 h4 47. Ke4 f5+ 48. Kf3 Rg3+ {This forces White's king to the second rank. } 49. Kf2 Kh5 50. Ra1 Kg4 51. Ra7 Rb3 52. Rxf7 Kxf4 {... h3 was best. } 53. Rh7 Rb2+ 54. Kg1 Kg3 {Threatening checkmate } 55. Rg7+ Kf3 56. Rh7 f4 {The h-pawn is immune due to ... Kg3, threatening mate and attacking the rook. } 57. Rh8 Rb3 58. Kh2 Ke2 59. Rxh4 f3 60. Rf4 {Here, the winning move is Rb1! and the pawn queens. } Kf2 {This allows White to draw with precise play. } 61. Ra4 Re3 62. Ra8 Re7 {Here, Ra2+ draws. } 63. Ra1 {White blundered because he only had a few seconds left on his clock. He resigned before I could play ... Rh7#. }
