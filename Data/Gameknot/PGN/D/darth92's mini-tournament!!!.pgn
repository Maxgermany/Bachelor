1. e4 {This is an short, 25 moves game, but hope you will find this game interesting.} c6 {Carro-Kann} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 f6 4. Qh5+ {I just wanted to make the short castle impossible} g6 5. Qe2 {Qd1 was better for development, but I wanted to support my pawn on e5} Bg7 6. exf6 Nxf6 7. Nf3 Na6 8. c3 Nc7 9. Be3 Qd6 10. h3 Bd7 11. Ne5 Rf8 12. Nxd7 Nxd7 13. Qd1 e5 14. Be2 e4 15. Nd2 O-O-O 16. Qc2 Kb8 17. O-O-O h6 18. Kb1 Nf6 19. Rhf1 Rf7 20. f3 Rdf8 21. fxe4 dxe4 22. Nxe4 Nxe4 23. Qxe4 {I ve been thinking we will exchange the rooks by now, but my opponent havent seen the thread..} Nd5 {..and probably wanted to extend the pressure on my black bishop via Re7 in the next move} 24. Rxf7 {now its clear - the trade is much better for deal for me} Rxf7 25. Qe8+ {game over. Funny thing on the end is: madcapsb accused me after this game for using chess programme. I can understand the frustration of loosing with an minus 300 elo player, but his own mistake in 23th move is more than clear. The conclusion is - David can beat the Goliath and in chess you never know - and one bad move really changes everything...}
