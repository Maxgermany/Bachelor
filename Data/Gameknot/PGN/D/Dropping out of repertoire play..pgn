1. e4 g6 {Black signals an intention to play a kingside fianchetto.} 2. d4 {At least so far, Black is playing a modern position while White accepts the classical position and occupies the center.} Bg7 3. Nf3 c6 {Interesting.  Prepares d5 but at the cost of being unable to immediately deploy the knight to c6.} 4. Nc3 d6 5. Bd3 Bg4 {This actually is not a bad place for the bishop, but the only purpose seems to be the relative pin.  This move actually ends up defining the flow of much of the game.} 6. Be3 e6 {This does prepare d5 except that d5 seems immediately playable.  Perhaps the ultimate aim is avoiding an isolated queen pawn, but I am not sure that an immediate d5 would create one.  There is also no reason to fear a reciprical pin should black play Nf6.  Black should develop a piece besides the e pawn for several reasons.  First, white is better developed with more central, active pieces.  Each black move that fails to create activity adds to the disparity between black and white.} 7. h3 {And second, he lacks escape squares for the bishop.} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 {The pawn capture would probably provide an interesting game, but this is probably the safer course.} Ne7 9. O-O O-O 10. Ne2 {His sole remaining bishop attacks the dark squares.  I can support the d pawn with this move and allow for c3 too.} Nd7 11. Kh2 {Once you use a repertoire long enough its ideas creep into your play even when you are trying to play an interesting, new game.  The move accomplishes two things.  It provides a waiting move, and it sets the stage for a potential kingside assault.  I do not really know if I want to fully commit to the kingside thrust yet.} b5 12. g4 e5 13. c3 {If the center breaks open, my g4 may have been premature, maybe terrible, but g4 discourages f5, which I believe is an advantage for white here.} f6 14. Ng3 {Essential preparation-- refering to white's move, but 13...f6 is probably a mistake as it weakens the black kingside and allows white to continue with a kingside attack.  He may be unduly concerned with white playing dxe5.  At any rate, I agree that the central test seems better suited to d5 because he has the ability to hold the square.} a5 15. Qe2 a4 16. f4 d5 {The center is potentially troublesome, but worth considering is exf as I think my hold on f5 must be wrestled with sooner or later.} 17. f5 Rf7 18. Rf2 Qa5 19. Raf1 a3 20. b4 Qd8 {I wondered how far he would push the attempt, but Qa4 is met by Bc2.  I successfully closed off the queenside.} 21. fxg6 {I still control f5, but I allow him a way to challenge it, but doing so creates a half-open h file.} hxg6 22. g5 {3 defenders and 3 attackers contest the f6 square, but if I can get in gxf6, it will fork two pieces.} Qc7 {He still cannot play f5, and I believe his idea was the pin.} 23. h4 Kf8 {I think little of this move.  I understand why: The hotseat is kingside, but he is going to need many moves to put his king safely on the queenside.  I do not think he has enough free moves to accomplish it.} 24. dxe5 {Time to add pressure.} Qxe5 25. Bd4 Qd6 26. e5 {And his position is creaking under the strain.  He cannot allow e6, but my real goal was undermining f6.} fxe5 {Expected Nxe5, but in reality after 26...Nxe5 27.Bxe5 Qxe5 28.Qxe5 fxe5 all these moves ultimately allow the next move Rxf7+.} 27. Rf2xf7+ Kg8 {Ke8 drops the bishop, but I believe it safer than this move.  Unfortunately, for him, he cannot afford to lose more material without equal or better compensation.} 28. h5 gxh5 29. Qxh5 {Too many threats for him to handle.} exd4 {Not his best defense, but perhaps he is resigning without actually doing so.} 30. Qh7# {}
