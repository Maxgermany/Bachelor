1. e4 {Please analyze the game here: http://gameknot.com/anbd.pl?bd=7519605&rnd=0.9532587080142416} e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 cxb2 5. Bxb2 {We played Danish gambit opening as a theme in a mini-tournament. This is the last forced move. White sacrifices two pawns for a strong attack on the king-side. Blacks biggest disadvantage is he is behind in development.} d5 {Black sacrifices the queen-pawn, the Schlechter defense.} 6. Bxd5 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 Bxc3+ 8. Bxc3 {Please note that black still hasn't developed any piece. One was developed, but it is not on the board any more... } Nf6 9. Nf3 Nxd5 10. exd5 {Please note that the g7 pawn is hanging.} Qe7+ 11. Kf1 {Moves the king to safety but looses the castling privilege.} O-O {11...O-O? - Black is castling too late and will loose a pawn.} 12. Qd4 {Battery threatening mate with Qxg7#} Qf6 {12...f6 also looses after Bc4 - skewering the queen and rook. } 13. Qxf6 {Exchanges queens to (i) win a pawn and (ii) weaken the king's pawn cover.} gxf6 14. Bxf6 {Material is even.} Bf5 15. g4 {15. g4? - looses a pawn. The idea was to open for the king to go to Kg2 with tempo by threatening the light bishop. 15...Bxg4 looses after Rg1 h5 h3. But the plan backfires after 15...Be4! } Be4 {Forks the knight and pawn. On top of that the knight is pinned to the rook. } 16. Kg2 {Protects the knight but now blacks white bishop is very powerful on the a8-h1 diagonal since three of white pieces are on the same diagonal.  One of Whites short term goals is to unpin the knight, thus diminishing the power of the light bishop.} Bxd5 17. h4 {Improves king safety and pawn structure - Prepares a king haven on h3.  It also gives more flexibility to further advance the g- or h-pawn.  Better is to change the order: 17. Rhd1 grabbing the d-file with tempo and then 17... c6 18. h4} c5 {Pushes the past pawn. This is the pawn of which the rest of the game revolves.} 18. Kg3 {The plan is to unpin the knight, starting by moving the king.} Nd7 {Develops with tempo and protects the c5 pawn.} 19. Be7 {* The forked c5-pawn is well defended and the rook moves to e8, a more active square. * The bishop is very exposed and will have to run to safety sooner or later.  Alternative is to retreat on (and still control) the long diagonal. e.g. 19 Bc3 where it also blocks the path of c5.} Rfe8 20. Rhe1 {* Protects the bishop.  * The knight pin is finally over. * Contests the e-file.} Be6 {Now the bishop must move again.} 21. Bd6 Rac8 {Puts the rook behind the past pawn.} 22. Rab1 {22. Rab1? - a wasted move - b6 is expected anyway.  Whites idea was to prohibit b5. But a4 would have done this job better. The rook belongs in front of the c-pawn.} b6 23. Rb2 {Prepares doubling on e2.} c4 {23...c4! Pushes the past pawn again. One step closer to queen-hood...} 24. Nd4 {White wants to trade off blacks white bishop. Please note that White fails to follow through his plans to double the rooks on the e-file.} Nc5 {Activates the knight.  * The knight blocks the c8-rook and the c-pawn has currently one defender, but that's OK since there's no attacker. * Stops a4 - a good move for white. * Black misses the opportunity to steal a pawn with 24 .. Bxg4 25 Rxe8 Rxe8 26 Kxg4 Re4 } 25. Rc2 {Attacks the c-pawn. It took the rook three moves to reach the c-file.} Nb7 {Shoos the bishop.} 26. Bf4 {I wanted to post the bishop on the a1-h8 diagonal but I was not comfortable with a pin when the the e6 bishop moves..} Nc5 {The knight returns to its excellent post.} 27. Be3 {White's idea at the time was to post the bishop against the a7-b6 pawns.} a6 {Black continues to push his pawns.} 28. Nxe6 {Finally White finishes off the bishop - something that could have been done on move 25.} Rxe6 29. Kh3 {White cannot take: 29 Rxc4 because of 29 ..  Ne4 ! 30 Kh3 Rxc4.} b5 {White has been totally unsuccessful of stopping the pawns so far.} 30. Rd1 {Seizes the open file.} Nd3 {30 .. Nd3?? a move that costs blacks knight and eventually the game.} 31. Rxd3 {31. .. cxd3 is not possible because the pawn is pinned to the rook on c8.} Rec6 32. Rd5 {Whites plan at this point is to: (i) stop the advancement of the pawns. (ii) trade off one rook only. White will need one rook and the king to finish off the queen-side pawns.    32 Rd5 is trying to  (i) get behind the queen-side pawns  (ii) prevents a5 (iii) threaten a king-side attack with Rg5  Bd4 Rg7 (but it's secondary) } f6 {* Prevents Rg5  * opens up for the black king to enter the game  * restricts the mobility of the dark bishop (but also makes the pawn a potential target)} 33. a3 {Prevents b4.} Rc8c7 {Prepares for the king to enter the game by preventing Kf7 Rd7 .} 34. Bd2 {Prevents c3, b4, a5 and the pawns are stopped. However the bishop cannot take the queen-side pawns since they are on opposite colors.} Kf7 {Every man to the pumps!} 35. Ba5 {Harasses the rook and blocks a6.} Rb7 {The rook doesn't want to leave the 7th rank. Hence no more doubling of the rooks.} 36. Bb4 {Blocks b5 and supports Rc5 or Rd6.} Ra7 {Supports a5.} 37. Rc5 {Fancy a trade?} Re6 {No! } 38. a4 {a4 challenges b5 (now the only defender of c4) which is locked to the defense of c4. This in turn locks a6 in its place.   Please note: * the strategic position of the f2-pawn which prevents the e6 rook from entering the 3rd rank. * white now owns the c-file. * blacks king is blocked from e6 by its own rook.  } Rb7 {A waiting move} 39. axb5 axb5 {Two queen-side pawns left...} 40. Kg3 {Every man to the pumps.} Rd6 {I think black wanted to vacate e6 for his king. But now white can force a trade of rooks.} 41. Rc7+ Rxc7 42. Bxd6 Rb7 43. Bb4 {Blocking the queen-side pawns.} Rc7 {Principally correct to place the rook behind the passed pawn but too quiet - the pawns will not move without the support of the king. Activating the king Ke6 or Rd7 seizing the d-file would have been better.} 44. Kf4 {Heading for the b5-pawn} h6 {Strengthens g5 but puts the pawn on a dark square and will tie the black king to its defense.} 45. h5 {45 h5! Stops all activity on the king-side.  * White is not interested in forcing a passer on the queen-side with a potential (and uncertain) pawn-race to queens. * Fixes the black king-side pawns on dark squares - same color as whites bishop. * Keeps the black king out of g6} Rd7 {Seizes the d-file. A move that could have been played on move 43.} 46. Ke4 Rd3 {Posting the rook on d3 to  * keep out the white king from the queen-side. * Prevent the f2-pawn from advancing.   Please note that  the f2 pawn still protects the 3rd rank from infiltration by protecting g3.} 47. Bd2 {with tempo: * Threatens the weak h6-pawn and therefore forces the black king back to g7, away from the action. * Opens the b-file for the rook.} Kg7 48. Rb2 Rd7 {Heading for d7. White cannot take yet because of 49. Rxb5 Rxd2} 49. Bc3 {Moves the bishop to safety. b5 is now ready for plucking.} Rb7 {The rook must leave the d-file and guard the b5 pawn - opening up for whites king to enter the queen-side.} 50. Kd5 Kf7 51. Kc6 {51 Kc6? - Kc5 is better} Re7 {Threatens to attack whites pawns with 52 (K or R)xb5 Re4 53 f3 Re3} 52. Kd5 {Fortunately white can have a second try by locking down the e-file.} Rb7 {The rook returns to guard-duty.} 53. Kc5 {53 Kc5 is better than Kc6. This relieves the rook of its duties to guard b4 - a move that would give black counterplay.} Re7 {Going to e4 again.} 54. Rd2 {Going to d4.} Re4 55. Rd4 Re2 {Blacks doesn't want to trade. 55 Rxd4 Bxd4 and blacks queen-side pawns are lost. Then white will sacrifice his bishop for the two king-side pawns and guide the f2-pawn to queen.  This is why the king needed to be posted on c5. Otherwise 55 .. Rxd4 56 Bxd4 b4 gives black counterplay.} 56. Rf4 {Black resigns after the double-threat on f6 and b5: * whites pawns are all protected. * the black rook cannot protect the b5 pawn at all because the bishop guards b2 and e5 * The f6-pawn will soon fall after Rxf6  unless Re6 which in turn leaves b5 hanging.}
