1. e4 {King pawn opening.} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. a3 Bc5 5. Qf3 d6 {I used to play d6 a lot. Recently I started to play d5. But on this occasion, I don't think it's a good idea..} 6. h3 Be6 {I don't know if this is the best move or not, but with his LSB targeting the f7 and his queen on f3 kinda freak me out.} 7. Nge2 Bxc4 {This one doesn't count but still it is a free bishop.} 8. b3 Bxe2 {I'm already up a piece so I don't mind exchanging materials.} 9. Qxe2 Nd4 10. Qd3 d5 11. exd5 Nxd5 12. Nxd5 {He also exchanging material eventhough he is down a piece.} Qxd5 13. O-O O-O-O {I chose to castle queen side to support the d-file and my queen if my opponent play c3.} 14. c4 {But he played c4.} e4 {I don't mind exchanging queen.} 15. cxd5 exd3 {He also doesn't mind.} 16. Bb2 Rxd5 {Start the count. One. The first free pawn that I get.} 17. b4 Bb6 18. Bxd4 {Another material exchanged.} Rxd4 19. Rac1 {Controlling the half-open c-file but I think Rfe1 might be a better choice for him.} Re8 {He didn't want it so I take it.} 20. g4 Re2 {Attacking his pawn and hopefully to create a passed pawn on d3.} 21. Kg2 Rxd2 {Two. Onother free pawn. Passed pawn created and I don't know why he made that move.} 22. Rfe1 {Now taking control of the e-file which I left behind.} Ra2 {Attacking another pawn and open the way for d3 pawn.} 23. Re8+ {My king will be out of check at a6. That's where he will go.} Kd7 24. Rce1 d2 {Bad move from him. His rook can't stay on e1. Blocking my pawn by playing d1 will lose the rook on e8. He has very little option here. He can't stop my pawn from queening unless sac his rook.} 25. Re8e7+ Kc6 26. Re1e2 {If I queen, I will lose the rook which is not a bad trade in my opinion.} Rxa3 {Three. Another free pawn. Still want to keep the rook for the time being.} 27. b5+ Kxb5 {Four. Two free pawns in a row.  At this point, I'm up a bishop and four pawns!} 28. Re2e5+ Ka6 {Successfully reach the a6 square. Now he has no more check.} 29. Re5e3 {Offering to exchange material.} Ra1 {It's time to queen and there is no way to stop it.} 30. Rxf7 {My turn to give him the free pawn.} d1=Q {The queen is back on the board.} 31. Rxg7 {I gave him two free pawns in a row but the sac is nothing as I already saw that both of his rooks will be out of the board. Though I have to give away both of my rooks and my bishop but the difference is still huge with my queen around.} Qh1+ 32. Kg3 {Forced.} Rg1+ 33. Kh4 {Forced.} Rdxg4+ 34. Rxg4 {Half-forced but Kh5 will lose the rook.} Rxg4+ 35. Kxg4 {Half-forced again.} Bxe3 {Eliminate the last rook from the board.} 36. fxe3 {And there goes my bishop.} Qg2+ 37. Kf4 Qxh3 {Another free pawn. The count is five though there is no way to save both of the pawns. My opponent resigned here. If count the last one, he gave away more than half of his pawn for free and it really cost him the game. Thanks for the game.}
