[Opening "Scandinavian defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {The Scandinavian defense is not the most popular opening, but hasn't got a huge amount of opening theory compared to other openings, so its quite a good surprise choice and isn't too difficult to use. It immediately questions whites presence in the centre, so from move 2 they're having to think for themselves a bit.} 2. exd5 Nf6 {The other variation 2. Qxd5 leads to a totally different type of game. Annotated games with that variation may discuss it in more detail. } 3. d4 {The most common choice, anticipating 3. Nxd5 and following that with 4. c4, building a central presence. If white defends the pawn with 3. c4 black can gambit a pawn with c6 or e6, which leads to long-term problems for white. It's not really a clever idea on whites part.} Bg4 {I sidestep the more normal lines. This move is more useful than it looks. I only used it once before on GK, against one of my team-mate buddies nicolso. The game was drawn.} 4. f3 Bf5 {Although black's lost a tempo, the move f3 is a liability for white, hampering their development and weakening their kingside. Sometimes it's worth losing a tempo for those sort of sweeteners.} 5. Bb5+ c6 {White now keeps their pawn advantage without having to play c4. Even so this gambit has merits for black.} 6. dxc6 Qa5+ 7. Nc3 Nxc6 {For my pawn i've got a lead in development and more space to work with, notably the half-open d column where i can place a rook. Whether this is worth a whole pawn is something no-one can prove for sure. But fingers crossed i can make a case for it in this game by winning.} 8. Nge2 O-O-O 9. Bxc6 bxc6 {Allowing the pawn structure around your king to be broken up isn't usually a good idea, but he has no pieces near my king and no open files on that side to stick rooks on. Ultimately white never really develops an opportunity to mount an effective attack on it.  I can easily move king whatshisname to the relatively safe a8 square if needed; the fact white has traded off their White sq. bishop helps its security there.} 10. O-O {White needs to castle, but i can see the a7-g1 diagonal as a potential weakness, thanks to that f3 move.} e5 {Threatening to win a pawn that's pinned to whites queen, we will battle for it now. Let the game begin..} 11. Be3 Bc5 {The d4 pawn is now also pinned to the bishop. its quite rare to have a pawn pinned to two different pieces. Basically, it's about as likely to move as the winner in a game of musical statues. } 12. Ne4 {Decent move that allows white to strengthen d4 with c3 and looking to trade off one of my pieces.} Bb6 {There's a few alternative moves here worth looking at. At first i thought the right move was 12. Nxe4 13. fxe4 Bxe4 to win back the pawn, but then if white goes 14 Ng3! the most likely continuation is exd4 15. Bd2 d3+ 16. Kh1 dxc2 17. Qg4+ f5 Bxa5 fxg4 19. Nxe4 which means black has traded a knight for three extra pawns, but with an atrocious pawn formation that aint worth it. Another is 12. Bxe4 13. fxe4 exd4 (13. Nxe4? loses to 14. Qd3! Nf6 15. Qf5+.) 14. Nxd4 Re8 15.c3 Rxe4 16. b4 Qc7 17. bxc5 Ng4 18. g3 Nxe3 which wins the pawn back for a big piece trade-off. 12. Bb6 keeps the game positional and unclear to white what they should do next.} 13. Nxf6 {This is possibly the best choice, removing the threat of me winning the e pawn. A 'safe' move like 13. c3 gives me options like Nxe4 14. fxe4 bxe4 15. Rxf7 Qd5! Which gives me good chances. Who knows what else could have happened, we're past the games database now. To me that feels a bit like leaving my cuddly home and going camping, where for some reason certain people find it funny to spray fires with deodarent. } gxf6 {White has also weakened my pawn structure (that becomes clear later) but on the downside i have an open g file to use at my leisure. I'd say whites last move was a double-edged sword, but i dont like that cliche so i wont.} 14. c3 c5 15. Ng3 {White decides to abandon the defense of d4. It clearly was a handicap, so letting it go is not a bad idea.} cxd4 16. cxd4 exd4 {This is quite clever from white, because my pawn structure is worse than bad, its non-existant. Five isolated pawns, two of them doubled. I do though have a passed pawn, which is often potentially dangerous. This game could go either way right now.} 17. Bd2 Qd5 {I don't think now is the right time for d3+, the pawn isn't that helpful on d3 and it gives white time to move their king to a safer square. And the squares on e2 and c2 are in my control already, if white moves a piece there d3+ wins it with a sneaky discovered check. Instead i move the queen to a safe square on d5 where it's got plenty of options later.} 18. Kh1 {well that's the end of my sneaky discovered check. I thought white might try and start a pawn storm with a4.} Be6 {I decide not to allow white to trade off their knight for my bishop. I'm looking at the possibility of moving this bishop to d5 later. This justifies my decision not to play d3 aswell, since that would leave the pawn more isolated.} 19. b4 {here he comes. I don't see any real danger, none of whites pieces are in particularly great squares, although my last move does give white the choice of Ne4.} h5 {On the other hand i have got some pieces pointing at whites king. I reckon i've got more chances of winning now. Koolio.} 20. Ne4 {White threatens to both win a pawn and place the knight on c5. } h4 {f5 doesn't look very good to me after 21. Nc5. if i follow that with something like 21. h4, then 22. Bg5! Rd6 23. Rc1 Rc6 24. Bf6 wins the d pawn. I'd rather keep the d pawn than the f pawn, so i decide to sacrifice the latter and continue my massive pawn storm on the kingside. I'm telling ya, four queens couldnt stop that ferocious little devil.} 21. Rc1+ Kb7 22. a3 {kinda pointless.. white could have played 22. Nc5+ Ka8 23. a4, which looks somewhat dangerous, or a simple defensive move in h3 to end my one-man pawn charge. Whites game gradually unravels from here.} h3 {Now i get some reward. Whites kingside defenses will be permanently damaged.} 23. g3 {Whilst i've got no immediate threat, this weakening could give me more chances later. It's worth it.} Ka8 {Enhances my kings safety, i couldn't see anything better at the time. I'll now be quite happy if white grabs my pawn.} 24. Nxf6 {He does. That pawn was almost useless, and in exchange i can shuffle my pack. For me that makes chess a better game than poker, where shuffling poor hands doesn't do anything so you have to bluff.} Qf5 25. Ne4 Bd5 {I mentioned earlier i wanted to do that. The purpose now looks clearer, pointing it at whites f pawn which has been weakened by white being forced to play g3.} 26. Nc5 d3 {Why play d3 now? A different move like Rhe8 allows white to play 27. Na4 and trade off their knight for my bishop, which i don't want. But if he tries Na4 now i can simply move the bishop to d4 and my game continues undisturbed. d3 also opens up a new threat, Rhe8 followed by Re2!, allowing me to win the f pawn which would be a total disaster for white. And white can't afford to move either the queen or rook from its defense. Its a thorn in whites side, to use another cliche.} 27. Bf4 {White tries to protect the f pawn. } Bc6 {I need to be patient right now, i need to guard my d pawn without moving the bishop off that diagonal. Bc6 accomplishes both those things.} 28. Rf2 {White knows what's coming, he'll do the best to to try and stop it.} Rhe8 29. Qf1 {Passive moves are all white can do here really. There doesn't seem to be anything much better.} Qd5 {Now Re2 will force the capture of the f pawn} 30. Rd2 {This move delays Re2, as white could then take it with the queen.} Qh5 {But now the threat's back on again, and worse still i can immediately take f3 now it's lost a defender. Nothing really fancy about my little sequence there, it simply takes away precious time from white.} 31. Kg1 {This is now the only defense possible, as Re2? allows g4! which enables white to safely exchange rooks after black moves the queen. } Rd4 {I could have continued with Bxf3 and still have a good position, but this move is even better, threatening 32. Rxf4 33. gxf4 Rg8+ which will lead to checkmate.} 32. Rxd3 {Whites game is now hopeless, his best chance is to accept losing their queen and hoping blacks naffs it up somehow.} Bb5 33. Rxd4 Bxf1 34. Rxf1 Bxc5 35. bxc5 Qxc5 36. Rfd1 Rd8 {I've now got a simple path to victory. Force a rook tradeoff and get my queen to c2, where white can't adequately deal with the checkmate threat on g2.} 37. Be3 Rxd4 38. Rxd4 Qc2 39. Rd8+ {White launches a couple of delaying checks.} Kb7 40. Rd7+ Kc6 41. Rd2 Qc1+ 42. Kf2 Qh1 {White can't prevent me winning their h pawn and then making mine my new queen. After its brave and important endeavures it has earned it.} 43. Bf4 {Whites last stand, he hopes black will forget to take this turn so he can defend it next time. Better late than never does not really apply in this situation.} Qxh2+ 44. Ke3 Qxd2+ 45. Kxd2 h2 {And there it is, it's all over. I found it quite an interesting and competitive game to annotate, and well played white who didn't appear to do a lot wrong. Hope you enjoyed it, see you around maybe..}
