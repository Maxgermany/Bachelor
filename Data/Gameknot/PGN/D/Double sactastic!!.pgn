1. d4 {Welcome to a short but explosive annotation, a game which from quiet beginnings erupts into a devastating double sac attack leading to a resounding win for black in less than 20 moves.  Queens pawn opening, not one I play, but I come across it often now and am fairly comfortable playing against.} d5 {My usual response....} 2. c4 {Immediately striving to dominate the center of the board, as black I don't think it's best to break the strain at the first time of asking...} e6 {So I lend support and open up space for my K's bishop to enter the game...} 3. Nc3 {The pawn still isn't worth giving up the center for in my opinion, so...} c6 {Forming a solid pawn structure at the expense of impeding my Knights natural spot of c6...} 4. e3 {Shutting the door on c4 for free.} Nf6 {More development....} 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Bd3 Bd6 {Almost mirroring each others movements, nothing seems out of place.....} 8. a3 {I don't see how this move was more important than to play 0-0 here, and seems a waste to me.....} O-O {I try and complete my development and feel as if I have gained a tempo in the process..} 9. O-O Re8 {This rook slide proves a very important move, without it my plan comes to nothing....} 10. b4 {Opening up space for some kind of attack coming from the queenside?} Ne4 {This  was risky but I really liked this move, as, unless he wants to trade the bishop it's fairly safe and I wanted it to stay there for as long as poss...} 11. Qc2 Ndf6 {Now my Q's Bishop is free to enter the fight and I dominate much of the board...} 12. b5 {This is a little annoying, but there's no way I'm gonna take it....} Bg4 13. Nd2 Qc7 {Now this is where I started to think about a sac, not realising just quite how well it would turn out...} 14. g3 {Pretty much forced...} Bh3 {Obviously....} 15. Re1 {Now it starts!!} Nxf2 {After 16.Kxf2 Ng3+ I felt I had a pretty good chance of attacking with vigour, however it didn't go as I'd foreseen....} 16. Bf5 {I had gone through a few scenarios on the conditional move page, this wasn't one of them, so I came up with something I thought would be nice...} Bxg3 {A double sac!! The bishop however is immune as 17. hxg3, Qxg3#} 17. Bxh3 {As Id expected but with the + comes the prize of a juicy rook...} Nxh3+ 18. Kf1 {Protecting the rook, but....} Bxe1 19. Kxe1 Rxe3+ {The game ended here, there is no escape 20.Kd1 Nf3# 20.Kf1 Qf4+ and it soon ends in mate even 20.Ne2 loses to Qxh2 21.Nf1 Qf2+! Short and sharp, the way I like to play a game if I can.}
