1. e4 {I am annotating this game for the benefit of my teammates in the Kingslayers.  Welcome all comments so we can improve together.} c5 {Sicilian defense, standard stuff.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Good to stop any knight or bishop excursions on the b5 square.} 6. Bg5 e6 {All pretty standard/book play thus far.} 7. f4 {White is getting a little aggressive here, threatening to do some action on the center.} Qb6 {Good response from Black, threatening b2 and getting some good counterplay on the center.} 8. e5 {Threatening his knight, forcing the next play.  Qd2 is a more book play.  The other downside of this play is that it leaves a lone center pawn with no other pawns to lend support.  Lone center pawns can prove troublesome to protect, and can sometimes cost the game down the line.} dxe5 9. fxe5 {Now comes a moment of decision for Black.  There are a few options worth considering, getting the knight to safety, but the Queen has the best play.  White will also now have some burden in attempting to protect the e pawn.} Qxb2 {Notice that the rook is not really threatened, but the even if exf6, Black can do some unpleasant things with some check combos.  Black also gains a 1 pawn advantage.} 10. Bd2 {I think that Na4 is a better response, forcing the Queen to the a3 square, but this move protects the knight and prepares for White to shoo away the Black queen.} Nd5 {Moving the knight to safety and threatening a piece capture.  White has a few interesting options in response.} 11. Rb1 {This move will force action on Black's queen.  A more interesting play is 11. Nxd5.  If Black doesn't retake with exd5, and does something like Qxd4, Nc7+ wins.} Nxc3 {An interesting exchange play that, if seen through, will rob white of castling.  However, a retake is pretty much forced by this play, since if 12. Bxc3, Qxc3+ wins a piece outright.} 12. Rxb2 Nxd1 13. Kxd1 {White has a fractured queenside pawn structure and has lost castle, but is only down 1 pawn, so still a competitive game.} Ba3 {An interesting move by Black.  The original goal was to get the bishop out to the c5 square, but White could simply move the knight to b4 and cause the bishop to have to move again.  The anticipated move by White of Rb3 would block that path and allow the bishop to go to where it would do the most good, c5.} 14. Rb3 Bc5 {Plan achieved.} 15. Be3 {White either has to defend or move the knight.  I actually anticipated Nf3.} O-O 16. Bd3 {Good placement for bishop.  When in doubt of where to place a bishop, centralize.  Another possible good spot would be c4, as it would prevent Black from moving the f pawn.} Nd7 {Continuing on with the development of Black's pieces.} 17. Be4 {Nice way to add some pressure on the b pawn.  This move gave Black some positional choices to make.  Also it centralizes the LSB on the main diagonal, so it can affect the maximum amount of squares.  I actually anticipated White moving a bishop to protect the e pawn.} Nxe5 {Unprotected pawn becomes a snack.  Down 2 center pawns, White needs a move to get equalization or he will have to sacrifice a piece to prevent promotion later on.} 18. Ke2 {Moving to get the King into the game to offer some protection to the DSB on e3.  It also prevents a back row rook check down the line, threatening to lose another rook.  More importantly, it will allow White to marry up his rooks on the b file.} Bxd4 {Black's final development is seriously hampered by the LSB on e4, so in order to uncomplicate things, I decided to trade pieces, allowing more flexibility in maneuvering.} 19. Bxd4 {White now has a 2 bishop to 1 advantage in a fairly open board.  If White can keep both bishops it will make things more challenging for Black.} Nc6 {Another option considered here was f5 to chase away the LSB on e4, but ultimately decided to offer White a trade, and a split of my a/b pawns.} 20. Bb6 {And White denied Black.  A good rule of thumb when you're down in points is to trade pawns and not pieces (unless you're trading up!).  With this move White further complicates Black's position and Black has no easy way to extract the bishop.  Nice move.} e5 {Recognizing I'm not getting much action for the bishop otherwise, time to open a diagonal and put that piece to work.  Also threatening f5 once the LSB is on e6.} 21. a4 {Looking to make a permanent post for the DSB, and if Black wants to trade for it, will reconnect White's pawns in the process.  Nice.} Be6 {Tempo move and completed development of Black's pieces (only 21 moves in!)} 22. Rb2 Rac8 {Preventing a piece exchange that would break up the a/b pawn chain.} 23. c3 {Uncertain of the utility of this move.  I would connect the rooks on the b file and then try to eat Black's b pawn.} f5 {Now that the LSB is on e6, no check counterplay is offered to White.} 24. Bxc6 {I would have probably have looked at Bd3 or Bc2 to preserve the 2 bishop advantage.} Rxc6 {Now there is a different color bishop end game.  Black will need a pair of pawns to promote.} 25. Ba5 {Better to connect the rooks on the b file.  The bishop on b6 did not need to be moved yet. } Bc4+ {Looking for some room to start marching the pawns down.  Also looking to get the LSB into the game more forcefully.  Also looking for a perch for the bishop with some follow on pawn action.  There can be no better perch for a bishop than bearing down on the diagonal to protect a pawn for promotion.} 26. Kf2 b5 {Removing the threat of a rook battery going after the b7 pawn.} 27. Bb4 {Equally good post for White's bishop, complicating Black's life a bit as well.} Rd8 {Rooks love open files.} 28. axb5 {There were a few choices to be made for Black at this point.  I could take with the pawn and completely block the c pawn, or take with the bishop.  My decision point was that if I took with the pawn, I now have another open file into my backside.  To limit White's options at counterplay, I opted to take with the bishop.  Later on this could cause me problems if White put a rook behind the c pawn to start pushing down the board.} Bxb5 29. Re1 e4 {White will need to get his bishop into play to stop those pawns.  A 4 on 2 advantage will require a piece sacrifice to prevent a promotion, with proper play from Black.} 30. g3 {Good instincts.  Hoping to break up the e/f pawn chain.} Rd3 {Besides blocking off the file, it also allows for more support to push pawns.} 31. Rc2 {Uncertain what White is going for here.  I would consider getting your rooks connected to forced away that Black rook on d3.} Rf3+ {The hope here is to get the other rook up on d3, but the White bishop on b4 is making that a multi-move endeavor.} 32. Kg2 Kf7 33. Rd1 {Rooks do love open files, but a dangerous move as it puts both rooks on a diagonal of the LSB of Black.  However, Black's rook is totally in the way.} Rd3 {Another move I considered for black was Rc7, to protect against the d7 check.  Ultimately I decided against it since it was too easy for Black to move the bishop around.} 34. Rf1 {So many tantalizing "almost" options for Black.  Alas there was no obvious way I could see to trade a bishop for a rook.  Rg3+ could be captured with a pawn, which would make it a poor trade.} g6 {Protecting the f pawn from a rook incursion.} 35. Rfc1 {Finally, White has doubled the rooks, looking to start a pawn push on c.} Ke6 {Looking to get the king into the game for offense/defense.} 36. c4 {The long awaited pawn push.  I have only one place to go.} Ba4 37. Rc2c3 {Sadly White couldn't bring a rook to the a file.} Rxc3 {Forcing the trade.} 38. Rxc3 {Now White is still down 2 pawns with diminishing piece options for counterplay.  } Rb6 {Hoping to trade rooks and go into a fairly decisive endgame.} 39. Ba3 {White obliges.  A better option was Bc5 and escape.} Rb3 {No choice for White now.} 40. Rxb3 Bxb3 41. c5 Kd5 {Now White is stuck on the c pawn and has to defend against 2 pawns down the center.  White needs a blunder from Black to survive this one.} 42. Kf2 Ba4 {To allow the king to get into the game and still guard the c6 square...} 43. Ke3 {A decent move to get the king involved, but regardless, coming 2 against 4 pawns is tough.} Bc6 {An important move to block the c pawn from advancing  as well as provide support to the f/e pawn march.} 44. Kd2 {Allowing my king to advance and get the square.  It might be best to give up the c-pawn and get the DSB involved.} Kd4 45. h3 g5 {in preparation for f4.} 46. Ke2 f4 47. gxf4 gxf4 {Now White is in serious trouble.  His remaining pawns are blocked and two connected passed pawns spells doom.} 48. Kf2 e3+ {Notice how the earlier bishop placement to c6 allows for a smoother advancement, seriously blocking White's potential responses.} 49. Ke2 f3+ 50. Ke1 f2+ 51. Kf1 Bb5+ {And that, as they say, is the ballgame.  Interestingly enough if the pawns on f/e were not connected, it would be very very hard to win this game, as opposite color bishops can block all sorts of promotions without the connected pawns to force the issue.  White should have given up the c pawn and instead brought his bishop into play.  The end likely would not have changed, but everyone makes mistakes.  A lone king against two connected pawns, a king, and a bishop is impossible to beat.} 52. Kg2 f1=Q+ {}
