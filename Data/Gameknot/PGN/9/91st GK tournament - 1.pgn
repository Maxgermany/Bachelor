[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 {Nimzovich-Larsen attack, modern variation} Nc6 3. g3 Nf6 {With him advancing g3 and b3 I want to really push to control the center. } 4. e3 b6 5. Bg2 Bb7 {Not super excited about this position.} 6. Ne2 d6 7. b4 a6 {getting ready to protect b5. I knew he would push pawns to my knight sitting at c6 or try to lure Nxb4, Bxb7} 8. a4 {and here it comes} d5 {I didn't know of another move to do here. } 9. c3 b5 10. a5 {I'm starting to like how this is turning out. } Be7 11. O-O h5 {Going to be a little aggresive here. If I get into trouble I can castle queen side and get out of immediate danger while I regroup. } 12. d4 e4 13. Nd2 {I think better move here would be h4 temporarily halting a push of my pawns to his king. } h4 14. Bh3 g5 15. Nc1 hxg3 16. Kg2 Bc8 17. Bxc8 Qxc8 {I have a definate advantage now. } 18. fxg3 Qh3+ 19. Kf2 Qxh2+ 20. Ke1 Qxg3+ 21. Rf2 Rh1+ {The end is almost near. } 22. Nf1 Ng4 23. Qe2 Nxe3 24. Kd2 Nxf1+ 25. Rxf1 Rh2 {black resigns. It was just a matter of finishing the game at this point. I felt good with this game. My first tourney in the advanced section. I will not win it but can sure throw the bracket off. He was the top rated player in the bracket. I know he just under estimated me and will probably kill me in our next game. Thanks for following along. }
