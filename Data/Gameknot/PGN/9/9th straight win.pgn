[Opening "King's Indian (E80), Saemisch variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 {So far a conventional King's Indian Defence, SÃ¤misch Variation.} Nc6 {Playable, but simply 0-0 is better.} 6. Be3 {So I continue with the normal development.} e5 {He hits at the centre.} 7. d5 {I take extra space.} Ne7 {I think the pawn sacrifice, Nd4 is much better. If white takes twice in d4, in return for the pawn, black gets rid of white's powerful black squared bishop. Chances would be even.} 8. Bd3 {White continues developing.} c6 {I think this is a slight inaccuracy too. Simply 0-0 looks better. Now black has to watch out for white playing d5xc6 and leaving balck with a weak d6 pawn.} 9. Qd2 {White maybe prepared 0-0-0 and/or Be3-h6.} h6 {Black prevents Be3-h6 but at the cost of meaning that he can't play 0-0 without losing his h6 pawn. 0-0 looks better.} 10. Nge2 {So I continue to develop.} a6 {Maybe preparing b7-b5 at some stage.} 11. g4 {I am preparing an attack on the King side. I am intending leaving my king in the centre.} c5 {This closes up the centre, and prevents me from playing d5xc6. But it comes at a cost. By playing c7-c6-c5 he has wasted a move, and made it harder to open up the queen side.} 12. Ng3 {Now that I have advanced my g pawn, I can put my knight behind it, as part of the general build up on the king side.} Rb8 {He seems to be preparing b7-b5 again.} 13. Kf2 {I connect my rooks, so that they can join the action in whichever side they are needed. } Bd7 {He is threatening b7-b5 now} 14. a4 {So I stop it.} b6 {And he prevents a4-a5, and leaving him a weak square on b6. Now a4-a5 can be answered by b6-b5!} 15. Rab1 {So I threaten to open up the queen side with b2-b4. } a5 {And he stops it. The only problem for him is now the queen side is just completely closed. There is no chance of opening lines there, and he just has to wait for my king side attack.} 16. h4 {I am threatening g4-g5 now, opening up the king side.} Nfg8 {This is an attempt to keep the king side closed. g5 will be answered by h5 and h5 answered by g5. The problem is after 17. g5 h5 I can still prepare f3-f4 opening up the king side.} 17. g5 {So I play it. } h5 {And he tries to block things up again. His problem is that he now has a completely passive position and must just try to defend.} 18. Bf1 {I decided that his best piece is his Bd7, and my worst was my Bd3, so the idea is to route it to h3 and exchange bishops. I was expecting Qc8 in defence. I was going to continue with Nc3-b5 attacking d6. He would be forced to exchange on b5 and them by bishop can reach h3 with tempo. Qc8 is no better or worse than the game continuation.} Nc8 {His knight is going to a7 to prevent my knight coming in to b5. The problem is on a7 his knight is rather away from the king side when things hot up there.} 19. Bh3 {So I prepare to exchange light squared bishops. } Na7 {He covers b5.} 20. Rbf1 {I intend to move my king and play f3-f4. If his Bd7 would be still left on the board, f3-f4 is well met by Bd7-g4 and his Bg4 becomes a nuisance. This is another reason why I want the Bd7 out of the way. As played, f3-f4 in fact more important in opening up the d1-h5 diagonal, rather than the f file.} Bxh3 {So he takes - they were coming off anyway.} 21. Rxh3 {I take back.} Qd7 {He hits the rook.} 22. Rh2 {I retreat.} Ne7 {Preparing a rather belated 0-0.} 23. b3 {I want to release my Nc3 to bring over to the king side. First I must give protection to my a pawn.} O-O {So he castles, but there are dangers of a sacrifice on h5.} 24. Nce2 {My Knight comes over, as planned.} Rbe8 {The rook on b8 wasn't doing much. now it has potential use on the e file.} 25. Ke1 {Preparing the f3-f4 break.} Nac8 {This knight no longer has to watch for Nc3-b5, but it is still a bit out of play.} 26. f4 {So here it comes!} exf4 {he takes.} 27. Nxf4 {I take back.} Be5 {His bishop finds a better square.} 28. Qe2 {I am now threatening a sacrifice on h5.} Kg7 {Trying to get a ook to h8 to defend.} 29. Nfxh5+ {But I get in first.} gxh5 {He takes.} 30. Nxh5+ {I take back. There is no good defence.} Kh8 {His king retreats.} 31. Nf6 {I attack his queen. I am also threatening Q-h5 with a mating attack.} Bxf6 {So he removes the knight, but now the g pawn reches f6 and helps the mate.} 32. Qh5+ {I throw in a check.} Kg8 {King moves.} 33. gxf6 {the end is near.} Ng6 {There is nothing better.} 34. Qh6 {And black resigns. Many thanks for reading this.
