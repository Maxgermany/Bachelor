Qf6 {With various exchanges of pieces I had ended up with just 3 pieces to defend my honour, one of which, the bishop, was stuck in position.} Ra7 {In order to release the bishop back into play I needed to get my king out of harms way.} 29. Kg3 {With the bishop now clear, but still covered by the king the focus resumes on attacking with the queen/knight combination.} Rd7 30. Nxh6 {At this point there was no absolute plan other than threaten the rook at G8. The rook at D7 would remain a problem for a few turns more.} Rf8 {At this point I heavily analysed the situation and decided that I needed to get the pawn at E6 out of the game. } 31. Nf5 {This required the sacrifice of my knight. } exf5 {Fortunately the bait was taken.} 32. Qe5+ {Fate had now been sealed. Three conditional moves were set up, all resulting in checkmate.} Kd8 {King on the retreat} 33. Bb6+ {Bishop is now able to come into play} Rc7 {Only move possible which allows game conclusion.} 34.
