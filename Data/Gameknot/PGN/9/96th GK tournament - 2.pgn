1. d4 {This is my first annotation so I hope it is fine.  I open up with the Queen's pawn.} d5 2. c4 {Decided to go with the Queen's Gambit.} dxc4 {Accepted.  Usually leads to an open game.} 3. e4 {Take control of the center.} Nc6 4. Nf3 Bg4 5. Be3 {Be3 gives more protection for the center pawn if my opponent decides BXN.} e6 {This move seems to lose momentum.} 6. Bxc4 {Now I have three minor pieces and substantial control of the center.} Bxf3 {This was anticipated.} 7. gxf3 {This move destroys my chances of castling but I still am protecting d3 from an assault.} Bb4+ 8. Nc3 e5 {In my opinion, developing the knight to f6 would have been a better move here.} 9. d5 {I decided to push the pawn instead of capturing e5.  Capturing allows for a strong knight at e5.} Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 {I had been waiting for this to remove the pin.} Nce7 {My opponent retreats which now gives me control of the center since now there are no minor pieces developed to challenge my bishops.} 11. Rb1 Rb8 12. Qa4+ {This move allows me to capture a pawn on a7.} Kf8 {I would have moved c6 down but that is my opinion.} 13. Qxa7 b6 14. Qa3 {Retreat back and pin the knight.} Ra8 15. Qb4 {Move the queen to safety while still pinning the knight.} Nf6 16. Bg5 Ra5 17. Bxf6 {I exchanged my strong bishop for his knight.  This may not have been my best move but I was thinking I could take control of the g column later.} gxf6 18. Rb2 Rc5 19. Ke2 {Setting up to connect my rooks.} Rg8 {He took control of the g column first.} 20. Rhb1 {Connecting the rooks.} Rg2 {Threatening the h pawn which will allow for a pretty much unabated march down the board.} 21. Qxc5 {Now, my thought process was QXR, PXQ, Rb8, QXR, RXQ+, Kg7, Rb7.  Of course after I made this move and analzed the board, Ng6 threatening check with the rook down there did not seem like the best course of action that I could have taken.} bxc5 22. Rb2b8 Nc8 {Ooops!  I did not calculate that into the equation.} 23. a4 {Now I am thinking, "Better try and promote."} Ke7 {This move breaks the pin to the king but the knight is still pinned to the queen.  Maybe Kg7 would have been a better move.} 24. d6+ {If he takes with the queen, I capture the knight.  If he takes with the knight, which in my opinion would have been the better move, I capture the queen for the rook.} cxd6 {Capturing with the pawn proves to be the turning point for this game.} 25. Rb1b7+ Kf8 {d6+ allows the bishop, who has been quiet most of the game, to start exerting pressure on the king.} 26. Rxf7+ Ke8 {Kg8 would have allowed me to capture the queen with the discovered check with Rd7+.} 27. Rxh7 {Threatening to take the queen with Rh7.  Plus this move protects the h pawn.} Rxh2 {Last ditch effort to stop the queen capture.  Rg8 would be met with BXR.} 28. Rxh2 {Now I am up in material, still threatening to take the queen.  My opponents options are very limited right now.  Any move would just prolong the inevitable.  He resigns.  My queen sac, although not the best move, does lead to a win.}
