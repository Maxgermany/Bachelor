1. e4 {Message from one of our club players. "Good attack by black using the diagonals, indeed, particularly interested because I had the impression white was better after the development. But what puzzled me more are the king's move (from both sides). I very seldom move my king, except to face an immediate threat and, I saw no such threats in your game. I also was surprised by one of your queen's move. I would be interested in seeing annotations about it.  } c5 { So this annotated game is in response to the club players questions. Often king moves fall under two rationales #1 king safety and #2 Waiting move. you will see the later sometimes in quiet positional positions such as in this game.  } 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nd7 5. Nc3 Ngf6 6. Be3 a6 {Hedgehog formation verses the English attack. } 7. f3 {My favored response when playing white. The idea is to setup for a quick king side attack with g4-g5 and h4-h5} h5 {blocking the g4-g5 idea} 8. Qd2 e6 {Setting up arguably the most flexible and strongest defensive walls in chess history. It is known as the hedgehog formation. } 9. Bc4 {?! not seen very often for good reason. The only reason white would want to play Bc4 is to put pressure on f7 which is only effective after black has committed his e-pawn to e5. So this move is an easy one to exploit. } Ne5 {gaining valuable tempo by attacking the hanging bishop and driving it to a less desirable square.  Though the tempo gain is temporary you will see quite a few of these kinds of moves from black in this game. The idea behind it is that white is forced to move a piece twice(the definition of poor piece placement and losing tempo). Only to have black develop another piece } 10. Bb3 {Also playable is 10. Be2. Even though it may look counter productive it may in the long run prove sounder than 10. Bb3. The rationale for this is that white's main idea is to play g2-g4-g5. Having the bishop on e2 supports that. furthermore many white players like placing a knight on b3 to contest the c5-strong point. } Qc7 {I am currently badgering my club students about the importance of developing pieces over moving pawns. In the alternative white must commit to queen side castling before playing the ... b5 ideas For example if 10...b5? right now then  11. O-O-O Bb7 12. Bg5 Qa5 13. Kb1 Nc4 14. Bxc4 bxc4 15. Rhe1 Rb8 16. Nf5 +/- } 11. O-O-O b5 {A little bit of saber rattling on my part. The Sicilian is often a game of inches and pawns. The Alternative 11...Be7 is just as strong if not stronger. But then again it does not give my opponent something to think about like 11...b5 does!} 12. Kb1 {Why 12.Kb1? The rationale is that it improves the king's safety by getting him off the hotly contested c-file and allows the white pieces congested on the d-file a little freedom to unravel themselves. I suspect that white wants to setup a powerful battering ram along f2-h7 diagonal with Qf2.  It also will give the d1-rook strength along the d-file. } Nc4 {forcing white to give up the bishop pair. Which right now is not significant but it will be later on. Plus the pawn on c4 acts like a wedge in white's position making it difficult for him to free himself.  } 13. Bxc4 bxc4 {A player can not go on the offensive he is tripping over himself! Also I  have created a new opening along the b-file. } 14. h3 {?! White's only hope of freeing himself is on the d-file. This is why I was expecting 14. Nde2 Bb7 15. Bf4 Rd8 16. Qe3 Nd7 17. Bg5 Rb8 =. This by the way is a great example of how improving piece position before moving a pawn could have maybe lead white to the better line. However, white wants to play g2-g4-g5. Something I can not stop effectively so I try to counter balance it with threats of my own. } Rb8 {A rook aiming straight down to the enemy king makes sense right?} 15. g4 Nd7 {forced} 16. Qe2 {At this point my opponent begins to make a series of queen moves in what I suspect is to mark time. } g6 {everything is dead level at this point. We are 16 moves in and I am still not ready to castle! My intend to play ...Bg7 with great influence along the central dark diagonal} 17. Qd2 {I think white is bidding his time, waiting for me to get impatient and over commit. I have a great deal of strength in these types of positions where there are only tiny advantages. } Qb7 {Why 17...Qb7? Even though attending to my king's safety with 17...Bg7 may be following sounder chess. The rationale is that it gains tempo by practically forcing white to defend the checkmate with Qc1. This puts the queen on a slightly inferior square. Though it still supports it's main duty of aiding the bishop on e3. If white chooses to defend the threat with 18.b3?! which is a positional blunder. He a created a lasting weakness on the dark diagonal. } 18. Qc1 {This small concession in piece placement is a small deal now but five moves from now the absence of the queen on d2 is a major reason for white's troubles. } Be7 {Now I can play my bishop move without lose of tempo. Playing ...Bg7 creates a target on d6. At this junction the DSB is the only one able to support the d6 pawn. } 19. Nde2 Nc5 {The classic outpost for this knight. } 20. Bd4 Rh7 {Both players are trying to improve their piece positions. These small moves are characteristically common in quiet positions like these. Though if I say so myself I have a slight edge due to the fact that my pieces are more aggressively placed. } 21. Bxc5 {Eliminates a strong knight for a equally strong bishop. Another plus is that it doubles black pawns on the c-file which is a big mess.  However, the black c5 pawn dominates the only useable center square on the board. White only has a rook on the d-file at the moment so he can not make good use of the file. } dxc5 22. f4 {activating his king pawns. No fear though any pawn exchanges only ensure that my bishop pair grow stronger!} Bd7 {Now this is quite an interesting position. It is not very often that you see a king perfectly safe on his original square. But more importantly is the silly little white queen sitting as useless as a sac of hammers on c1! A by product of the little 17...Qb7 in between move. Had I played 17...Be7 the queen may still be on the active d2-square. } 23. e5 {?? a major blunder that completely gives black a winning game and control of the long diagonal. Though apparently it is not so easy to see because we had quite a long discussion on the club forms on weather black had an advantage or not} Bc6 24. Rhg1 hxg4 {!! the breakthrough moment. The black harmony of Bishop + Rook is going to destroy everything in it's path. } 25. hxg4 Bf3 {Setting up an attack on g4 with the threat of winning a pawn. } 26. Rde1 Rh4 27. g5 Bd8 {Rejuvenating the bishop. The plan is to go to a5 to put pressure on b7 via c3. } 28. Ka1 {The king tries to run for cover. } Ba5 {X-raying the rook on e8} 29. Rgf1 Rh2 {The bishop is covered by the queen on b7. } 30. Ng1 {trying to win the bishop but now the weakness along the 2nd rank is too much } Bxc3 {good trade no?} 31. bxc3 Bg4 {possibly Bg4 attacking c2. } 32. Qa3 {marshaling the troops to the kings defense. Making possible Rb1} Qc6 {defending a6 and avoiding Rb1} 33. Reb1 Rb5 34. Rfc1 {34. Rxb5 drops the c2 pawn. } Kf8 {Why 34...Kf8!? I was worried about a possible queen check on ...b8 via 35. Rxb5 followed by 36.Qa7 } 35. Rxb5 axb5 36. Qa7 {now the king can duck to g7 without white being able to force the exchange of queens on d3. } Kg7 {white resigned now that c2 is about to fall. }
