1. d4 {White open d4, on my opinion he is a positional player. which in contrast with me I'm attacking player, usually I'm playing e4.} Nf6 {I usually refute d4 by Nf6, this is my psywar against white, he doesn't know what is my idea on my opening, because I can transpose this to any openings, unlike d5.} 2. c4 {white continue pushing his pawn to c4. } g6 {Here is my idea like my idol Fischer likes the Kings Indian Defense, But I only bluff white, since I decide to play my opening repertoire the Gruenfeld defense.} 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. g3 {g3 added the pressure on d5 by fianchetto of his king bishop. which is a natural move} O-O {usually all of my games I prefer early castling.} 5. Bg2 d5 {Here is the Gruenfeld defense. I provoking white to capture my pawn in which he did.} 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. O-O c6 {I played c6 here to support my knight in d5 and as well to prevent any possible attack by bishop on my rook} 8. Nc3 {Here white played Nc3 to challenge my knight in d5,with the idea of e4 } Bg4 {I played Bg4 here to restrict the space dominated by white pieces in center} 9. h3 {very obvious move} Bd7 {usually i'm not exchanging my bishop against knight unless it was necessary. Bg4 only is a psychological move, I'm provoking white to push his h3 to add weakness on his kingside.} 10. Qd3 {white queen maintaining his idea to dominate the center.} Na6 {I played 10. Na6 followed by 11. Nc7, to prepare for white e4} 11. e4 Nb6 {I played 11. Nb6 here instead of Nf6. My idea is to stop annoying white Bg5, as well I see the weakness of c4 square. And as well the benefit of Nb6 my bishop indirectly pin white rook in a1} 12. Be3 {Finally white develop his 2nd bishop to support his d pawn} Be6 {Followed by Bc4 to skewer the queen and rook.} 13. b3 f5 {I have a second thought for this move since it will create a weakness on my e6. But I don't want to let white to dominate the center, which is very vital in a strategy and planning.} 14. Ng5 {This is a premature move, white should played here 14. Rac1 followed by 15. Rfd1, he should consolidate his position first.} Bc8 15. Rad1 h6 {I'm starting to push backward the white pieces, particularly this annoying knight} 16. Nf3 fxe4 {This is my plan to eradicate the white e pawn} 17. Nxe4 Nd5 {I played Nd5 to centralize my knight. I can play Bf5, but it will eject only by g4. I'm still looking the possibilities to capture h3 pawn} 18. Nh4 Nab4 19. Qd2 {I thought white will play Qb1 to add pressure on g6 square, but he's looking the h6 pawn. } Kh7 {the natural move to defend my pawn in g6 } 20. a3 Na6 21. Qd3 {white return his queen to d3 to pin my pawn in g6 } Qe8 {Instead of 21...Qe8 I can play here 21... Bf5, but I'm hesitate since after white's 22.g4, my move is  22..Bxe4, followed by white move's 23. Bxe4, and naturally my reply should be 23..Rf6.which gives me uncomfortable position} 22. Nd2 {white move is very obvious here} Bf5 {atlast I'm decide to exchange my bishop against white knight!!} 23. Nxf5 gxf5 {My idea of 22... Bf5 is to break white pawn particularly the g pawn so I can put my rook's command in g file. This could be happen by pushing my pawn to f4} 24. Nc4 {This is the plan of white to stationed his knight in beautiful square e5} Kh8 {Kh8 to unpin my king} 25. Ne5 Rd8 {followup by 26..Bxe5 and move my knight since my rook indirectly pin the white queen} 26. Qd2 Kh7 {Kh7 is a psychological move, I can play here 26..Rf6, but I'm very uncomfortable to limit the activity of my bishop, since I will prepare to rid the white's knight.} 27. Rfe1 {white is eyeing my weakness in e file} c5 {I'm start to counter attack to remove his pawn in d4 } 28. f4 {white normal move to support his knight in e5} Qb5 {at last my queen is active!!} 29. Bf2 cxd4 30. Bxd4 Qxb3 31. Kh2 {white can play 31. Qd3 but he don't want to exchange his queen, my plan to move from middle game to endgame..Most of my victories is on endgame by simplifying the position. I'm study hard endgame than openings and middle game..} Ndc7 {to pin bishop and to stop to capture my pawn in a7 and just in any case for the escape of my queen, since white can capture my b7 pawn by moving his rook in b1} 32.

Rg1 followed by Bg2, 36.Rd3 blocked his white queen tour to f1 for king's defense.} Qc2+ {white probably overlook this move..} 37. Bg2 Rg6 {white queen is overloaded: first on his bishop then on his rook in d3} 38. e6 {Correct move here is Rxd4, white should capture the knight..} Rd6 39.
