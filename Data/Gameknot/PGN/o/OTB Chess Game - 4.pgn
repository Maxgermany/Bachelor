[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 {I stick with my usual.} c5 {I am not surprised that Tom played the Sicilian Defense.  Unlike with other players, I generally don't know what he'll play next since he often deviates between this move and 1...e5.  So, taking it one step at a time is important because what I have learned in playing against him, is what Ken emphasized in our second training game.  That openings can be intense.  As he plays different things, during those common openings and takes me off guard.  So, despite what I learned, as bad as it might sound, to me reality is that I need to expect the unexpected.  As looking into it, I think that one of the things that I did wrong with Ken, when tying the lesson about assessment and mobility, was not being ready off for getting taken off unfamiliar territory.  Given how fierce they are, I think that one must be ready for anything and everything.  That's what I learned, which is how it unfolds here.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {As I'm not so used to playing against the Closed Sicilian Defense.  So, this is pretty educational.  I'd say as much as the Owen's Defense.  That's because when Ken played that against me the amount of times I encountered it, come to think of it, was only once or twice more.  Thus, in this case, if I seem to remember correctly, this is only the second time that I've encountered 2...Nc6 as part of the Sicilian.  As most of the time, 2...d6 has been played against me.  } 3. Bb5 {Not knowing what to do, but having that attitude of being ready for anything and everything, I treat it like a Ruy Lopez.  First, I asked myself the question that ION asks me.  Does it work?  The answer here is yes.  And, after this move, although not happy (as I've learned not to be too happy about the position,) I am comfortable.} e6 {This, however, is a move that I have not encountered during the Sicilian.  So, I gave this some thought about what to do.  Believe it or not, I almost played 4.d4 as I was thinking about treating it like a French Defense.  But, I decided that it does not work here, as Tom would've been able to exchange.  And, I am not ready to exchange yet.  The only reason to exchange was that it would be possible.  But, as I learned, that is not the way to go, and with it, I ruled that move out of court.} 4. O-O {Thus, I decided to castle, at once.  That's because as TA said, in general, if you castle before move 10, you're often in good shape.  That's because of the idea of castling early and often.} Nf6 {But, I'm not surprised that Tom played this.} 5. Nc3 {Thus, I continue with my development.  With that being said, it does work here, so I treated this like a Two Knights Defense, even though, it's nothing like it.  Might not be ideal to think this way, but it's certainly how I feel comfortable and get ideas about what to do in unfamiliar territory.  In other words, I'm not longer hesitant.} Nd4 {Of course, Tom's goal is to exchange my Bb5.} 6. Bc4 {Like what Ken has mentioned, I refuse.} Qc7 {I'm not sure why Tom played this.  He hasn't castled continued with his development. } 7. d3 {Feeling like his last move was inaccurate, I open up a line for my Bc1.} Nxf3+ {?! Of course, I wasn't ready to exchange.  But, I am glad that it happened here.  As I deem this exchange to be an inaccuracy on black's part.  As I am not going to destroy my K side pawn structures.  Instead, I'll back with and strengthen my Queen in the process, as you'll see.  Not only that, but his N will be gone which will enable me to harass his Queen later on.} 8. Qxf3 Bd6 {First, Tom has a threat that must be dealt with.  The goal is to win my h2 pawn and maybe even expose my King.} 9. g3 {So, I stop Tom from playing 9...Bxh2+.} b6 {So, Tom comes up with another plan by fianchetoing his Bc8.} 10. Nb5 {And, that's when I harass his Queen with this fork.  Once it retreats, I ask myself if exchanging would be wise or not.} Qc6 11. Nxd6+ {After some thought, I decided that it was on and the green light is on.  Tom is in check, and when he takes back, I can win material.  But, here is a good example, though, of how timing is important.  As I did consider 11.e5? first.  The idea is a fork which should win material.  But, with the B there, he would've been able to play 11...Bxe5, and taking on 12.Qxc6 would not have won the Queen do to his d7 pawn.  So, I would've exchanged Queen and been a pawn down.  And, the reason I mention this is up until about a week or two ago, I forgot just how important timing was.  It was off again in another game, but then ION said that timing was vital.  And, if I had played that a move or two later, it would've been good.  Same thing happened in Edna's game with which I coached and was her only commentator.  Her opponent made a terrible blunder and taken the B.  Had the opponent waited and attacked Edna's Queen first, it would've worked.  As from there, she'd be forced to retreat, with which her opponent would've gotten a free piece, and she'd be able to liquidate.  But, by capturing a move early, Edna was able and later on, delivered a checkmate.  I kept this in mind when making that decision, and thus, held off on that until the next move.  That's because with the B gone, black is in serious trouble.  At best, Tom will lose his N for a pawn.  That is, if he doesn't take back, but rather, retreats, which would allow me to play 13.exf6.} Qxd6 12. e5 Qxe5 {?? Thinking that Tom has dodged the bullet, though, he took here.  But, this move is even worse, as now, I will capture on a8, leaving me a Rook for pawn up.  BTW, similar to what you saw in my game with tombulous when he took my B, and I captured the same way; I kept this variation in mind when playing 10.Nb5.  In other words, I saw this coming on my 10th move.} 13. Qxa8 O-O {Doing what he can, Tom castles, at once.} 14. Qxa7 {From the way I see it, though, it is too little and too late, especially since I'm now up the equivalent of a Rook with nothing in return.} d5 {Doing what Tom can and hoping for a blunder, he played this.  Believe it or not, it is Hope Chess which almost worked.  And, that's where I still need to work on taking my time and not moving too fast.  } 15. Bb5 {As my original play was an oversight.  The move was 15.Re1??  Forgetting that my Bc1 was not developed the idea was centralizing my Rook, whilst attacking his Queen.  But, with my B locked in that hope almost worked, as now, he would've equalized.  This is important because unlike here, if this were still the tournament, that would've been the final move.  And, it's not because there's not much time.  Instead, it's that once you've made that move, even if you see that it's a mistake, there's no going back.  Thus, I would've lost all of my advantage.  I'm only lucky here that it's not.  So, I took that move right once before he captured, so it was just before I saw what he was about.  That's when Tom reminded me to take my time which is what also needs work during the tournament.  The other move that I considered was hitting the Queen by bringing my Bc1 into play.  Problem is that I can't since that is keeping my b2 pawn protected.  It's also worth noting that for the obvious reason fianchettoing would be just as bad as Re1??, so that was not considered.  Not knowing what else to do, I decided to play it safe and protect my LSB. } Qh5 {At first, I was surprised to see Tom play this.  But, I figured out why, and it turns out that this is a dangerous plan.  Again, it is Hope Chess as he's hoping that I would overlook the threat which would allow the threat, as afterall, I'm threatening to take on b6.} 16. f3 {But, remembering what happened in my rated game against bhidragon, I take it very seriously.  As I had considered 16.Qxb6??  However, this is another reminder of where timing is important.  In this case, it involves what bhidragon told me which is seeing the big picture.  Another way of saying it is seeing everything that's occurring on the board in order to figure out what the position demands.  The idea being is that Tom was threatening a checkmate on me.  So, if I had captured on f6, he would've played 16...Ng4  After which, there would have been no way to prevent 17...Qxh2#  Additionally, no good would've been attempting to prevent the same move with 18.h3??  As after 18...Qxh3 Tom has gotten back a pawn, and the threat is renewed in almost the same way that I saw with bhidragon.  Since after a blunder, he had a crushing attack which started with Qh3  And, I used that same strategy in two games afterwards, so I am familiar with the pattern.  Afterwards, I could still delay 19...Ng4 with this move, but after 19...Qxg3+ white is still busted in a winning position.  So, this move prevents that trouble, as Tom's N can't just come in.  With that being said, what I also remember was Jack's lecture on just how dangerous the N's can be.  Well, this is a perfect example.    } d4 {With that being said, I guess that Tom is trying to hold off on the attack with this attack. } 17. Qxb6 {But, unlike before, with the threat gone, it was now safe to play this.} Nd5 {Doing what Tom can, he attacks my Queen.  But, similar to what Ken said, nothing will stop me from taking on c5.} 18. Qxc5 {With that being said, this is when I would resign.  As Tom is far behind without a chance of counterplay.  If it were stronger opposition, and not of equal strength, I'd probably resign right after losing the Rook.  But, this is further behind, and, therefore, there is nothing else to get from this game.  But, I guess that Tom doesn't feel this way.} Ne3 {With that being said, Tom tries to get my Rook.  But, he overlooks that it was pinned to his Queen.  With that being said, I will allow him to take my Rook in exchange for his Q and N.  } 19. Qxh5 Nxf1 20. Kxf1 e5 {Not knowing what else to do, Tom advances his e pawn.  Maybe, he wants a passed pawn.} 21. Qxe5 {But, I just take it.} Bh3+ {And, this check is of no concern to me.  Tom doesn't have his Queen or anything else that can make this check harmful.} 22. Kg1 Be6 {Tom must have been worried that I would play Qf6-g4 followed by Bh6 where mate would be threatened, especially given that he would not be able to play ...gxh6 since it's pinned.  I was thinking about that line but since it prevents it, and even before that, I was asking myself what to do.  First, it is possible for me to take on d4.  So, that is my next move.} 23. Qxd4 Bh3 {I think that Tom is worried about the same.  So, I decided to take his B, instead.} 24. Qh4 Be6 25. d4 {Thinking about where to go I played.  I was even thinking about bringing my Bc1 into play.  But, I decided that it would not be necessary, as I have some dangerous passed pawn.  So, I decided to advance one of them.  I was then thinking that I would be, at some point, possible to bring my Bc1 into play.  And, even, Sacrifice my Queen for his Rook to promote.  As from there, it's a forced line.  So, I was thinking along these lines which involves several variations.  And, that's important to think about. } Rd8 {?? But, this move, however, makes it very easy for me.  And, it is a forced win at once.  If the Rook weren't emprise, I'd ask what you'd play as otherwise it's a lot harder.} 26. Qxd8# {The idea is that even without mate, I was going to play this anyhow, as it wins a Rook at once.  In other words, there no need to promote or sac the Queen to do it.  However, I looked at it and it's even more then just winning the other rook which is also the reason behind it.  That's because I figured out that this is checkmate since Tom's back rank was unprotected.  I seized advantage of my opportunity and went for it.  It was an interesting game, but after Tom's double blunder early being a piece and then a Rook, I had the advantage and did not give it back.  In doing so, I was able to force the win.  But, what I learned here is that even with the win I still need to take my time.  That's because by moving too quickly, I almost gave up my advantage and allowed equalization being the general oversight where I almost blundered the R which would've happened in a tournament where there's no going back.  So, it is very important to be aware of that, as well as, remembering how important the timing is.  As the timing by one move made the difference between losing a pawn and getting a piece for pawn.  By holding off just one move, it worked out in my favor which is what allowed me to take advantage of the first blunder.}
