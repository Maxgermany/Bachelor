1. f4 {1. f4 however, is made of other proportions: this move plays a major role in many opening systems for White; like e4, e5, f4 (Kings' Gambit), or e5, c5, f4 (Morra Gambit), and a couple of others: in this case, it will turn into a regular Dutch defense Reversed; or Advanced, or whatever...} d5 {the logical reply: in fact, we are playing 1. d4, f5; but reversed in colour: these are very instructive games...} 2. g3 Nc6 3. c3 {analog to c6, after Nc3: keep the Knight at bay...} Nf6 4. d3 {also Ne4 needs to be discouraged: White has no fear for Ng4/Bg4; h3 will solve that...} e5 5. Bg2 Bf5 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. Nh4 {Black is rushing things: e5 comes way too early...} Bg6 {the only other safe move is Bd7: Black does not give up that easily...} 8. f5 Bh5 9. h3 e4 {a clever counter attack: but Black is under pressure...} 10. g4 Bg3+ 11. Kf1 Bxh4 12. gxh5 Nxh5 13. e3 {attacking Nh5...} Ng3+ 14. Kg1 Nxh1 15. Kxh1 Qg5 16. Qg4 O-O-O 17. dxe4 dxe4 {introducing a new problem: Rd1+ will lose Bc1...} 18. Na3 Qxg4 19. hxg4 Rd1+ 20. Kh2 Bg5 21. Nc4 Re8 {something needs to be done about e4...} 22. b3 b5 23. Na3 a6 24. Bb2 Rd2 25. Bc1 Rd3 {back to Rd1, will bring Black nothing...} 26. c4 Bxe3 27. cxb5 {a nasty twist...} Bxc1 28. Rxc1 axb5 29. Nxb5 {Whites' Queen side pawns are loose...} Red8 {losing control...} 30. Bxe4 Rd3d2+ 31. Kg3 Rd8d6 32. Bxc6 {Nxd6, Rxd6, is giving Black drawing prospects: White first needs to tilt the material balance in favor...} Rxc6 33. Na7+ {stronger, than a direct Rxc6: never waste a good threat...} Kb7 34. Nxc6 Rxa2 35. Ne7 Rb2 36. Rc3 c5 37. Nd5 c4 {an interesting position: White cannot play Rxc4, Rxb3+; bxc4 induces Kc6, bringing White all kinds of trouble...} 38. b4 Kc6 39. Ne7+ Kd7 40. Rxc4 Kxe7 {White has to return material: before things go sour...} 41. Kh4 f6 42. Rc7+ Kd6 43. Rxg7 Rxb4 {Rh2+, Kg3 leads to nothing...} 44. Rxh7 Ke5 45. Rg7 Rf4 46. Re7+ Kd6 47. Re6+ Kd5 48. Rxf6 Ke5 49. Rg6 {}
