1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. c4 {?! When I play as black against Ted, this is how it always start.  But, I didn't expect this move.  In fact, I feel that I might have a slight advantage here because this crams in his Bf1 which I will try to take advantage.  That's why I deem it is inaccurate.} Nf6 {With the situation that I mentioned, I've got development in mind and start doing it.} 4. Nc3 {I guess that Ted has the same thing in mind.  What I kept in mind is that obviously prevents a later 3.c4.  But, I asked myself the chance that he'll play Nb5.  And, I realized that, on top of development, one reason that white might have played this was to allow 5.Nb5.} a6 {So, I prevent that at once.} 5. a4 {I don't know why Ted played this.  Maybe, he wanted a semi open file.  But, it doesn't help with his development or center control.} Bg4 {So, I pin right away.} 6. h3 {I expected 6.Be2 since that's the most common way to break the pin, as Coach Stockel has mentioned.  This is ok to.} Bxf3 {As usual, I asked myself what to do.  I didn't exchange just due to the important dream.  Before that, when I wasn't sure, if it were N for B, I'd exchange just because it was possible.  So, it was still being too readisome to do it.  Then, came a lesson with GM Susan Polgar at Polgar University 2017.  In a very small segment she talked about exchanging and said that even N for B doesn't mean you should exchange.  Instead, you should only engage in an even exchange when there is an immediate advantage.  Then came the dream, and that's when the lord said that I still need to change my thought process and not think that exchanging gets rid of my problems.  On top of what Ken said, that's also where I realize that Jack was wrong by advising me to exchange whenever possible against stronger players.  As Susan implied that being up against stronger opposition is even more of a reason to not just go into exchanges.  But, here, I asked myself what choice do I have.  For example, after 6...Bh5, which I considered 7.g4 Bg6.  Forgetting that the other N was exchanged, I had Ghost Vision and thought 8.Nf4.  Once again, I jumped the guns but there since in that situation, an exchange is forced, sooner or later.  My other thinking was that I didn't want to be forced to retreat to e6 where the center is blocked or move to d7 where it has less mobility.  And, I didn't want to undevelop my B to c8.  So, I thought that the best option was this move to prevent the worries.  Well, my assessment and thought process was wrong due to the Ghost Vision.  Had I remembered that one of his N's was exchanged and where it would go, my assessment would've been correct.  So, much better was 6...Bh5, as 7.g4?! and not only do I retreat to g6, but his K would, at the very least be weakened which favors black.} 7. gxf3 {?! With that being said what I had expected would been best which is 7.Qxf3, as now, Ted's K side is weakened even more then what I noted earlier due it not just being advanced but having those doubled pawns.  That would be an asset if white is to castle later on.} g6 {Trying to find a good spot for my undeveloped B, I fianchetto.  It'll have better mobility this way then by advancing the e pawn.  That's because it'll cover more squares.  Although I didn't review that as important with a lecture by easy19, GM Susan Polgar said that how many squares a B is extremely important.} 8. Nd5 {Getting ready to exchange.  I really wanted to say no and was, therefore, tempted to play 8...Nfd7.  But, that would've appeared to cramp my less Q side as that gives me less mobility and would make it difficult to develop my Nb8.} Nbd7 {And, that is exactly why I played this.  As now, I'm ready in case Ted decides to exchange since I'll bring the d7 N to a better square.} 9. Nxf6+ Nxf6 10. d4 {Breaking through in the center.  I did ask myself if exchanging works.  Susan was specifically alluding to pieces, btw.  But, Ken said that whether to exchange pawns or not is important.  I decided that it was the best way to go.  However, it's not as it appears being the thrills for exchanges.  Instead, there's a plan behind it.} cxd4 11. Qxd4 e5 {And, it's this move.  As I gain tempo.  The idea being is that once Ted retreats, I can, finally, complete my development and prepare to castle.} 12. Qe3 Bg7 13. Bd2 {With that being said, Ted continues with his development.  } O-O {And, that's when I use my opportunity to castle, at once.} 14. a5 {I don't see the point of this move.  If it were to bring his R to the fourth rank it would make sense.  But, Ted doesn't do that.} Qc7 {Seeing a potential weakness, I go after Ted's c pawn with which he defends.} 15. b4 Rac8 {And, I play this.  The idea being that, in general, you want to play your R behind the Q.} 16. Qb6 {Ted's goal is to exchange.  For a few minutes, I asked myself if that's a good idea.  Well, there was another move that I considered.  That was, believe it or not, 16...Qxd4?? since the B is cramped.  But, I realize that he'd uncramp by winning my Q as they are on the same line.  In the end, I did it as this doubles Ted's pawn again.  More importantly, I am analyzing a variation that appears to win a pawn starting with this move, but there was something that I miscalculated.  } Qxb6 17. axb6 Nd7 {This was a part of the plan behind the exchange as I now have an attacker against the Q.  When Ted defends...} 18. Be3 Rc6 {I attack again.  And, this is where I thought that exchanging automatically wins a pawn.  What I forgot is that it shouldn't achieve the goal.  Thus, my variation and assessment was incorrect.  I was thinking about what occurs.  His next move was also planned.} 19. c5 dxc5 20. bxc5 {? But, had Ted played 20.Rc8 the plan behind exchanging would have failed as now he would have had another defender to equal my attackers.  By taking right away, which I anticipated knowing him, white winds up a pawn down.} Nxc5 21. Bxc5 Rxc5 22. Ke2 {I don't know why Ted played this as this blocks his B.} Rb5 {That allows me to go right after his b pawn.} 23. Ke3 {But, by playing this move, I think I've got something better.  As I believe that when you see a good move, you should look for something better.  Although, I do like just playing the good move which would've been to grab the b pawn.  However, I thought that black might just have an immediate win here.  So, I try with my next move.} Rb3+ 24. Ke2 {Being that Ted was forced onto the second rank with his K.} Rc8 {And, I prepare to deliver another nasty check.} 25. Bg2 {I guess the idea was trying to get the B to a better spot.  But, I can and will check again which forces white's K onto the first rank.} Rc2+ 26. Kd1 {I am not surprised that Ted attacked the R.  But, I will now grab his f2 pawn.} Rxf2 27. Rc1 {I guess he's prepared for a check.  But, that doesn't bother me.} Bh6 {As now, I can do a lot with my DSB.  A small part is the R being attacked.  But, I also might have a check mate.} 28. Rc8+ Kg7 29. Rc2 {And, this is when Jack gets involved after finishing his training game with Mariann.  I am not happy that he made this move.  As now, not only can I win, but as usual, by doing this, he distracted me as well as Ted.  I didn't know what Ted was going to do, and then all of a sudden, Jack played this for white.  That distraction became terrible, as you're about to see.  It won't change the plan, but it causes me to overlook something else which turned into a bad move, similar to what you saw in my first training game with Mariann where I coached her, as per Ken's comment.  That was when I failed to take a piece but took a pawn, instead.  The intention was to protect the B, but I don't need the B when I've got something better.  But, as noted, I missed the opportunity.} Rxb6 {?? I had this sac in mind.  In other words, I decide to give up my Rf2.  But, had I not been distracted, I would've seen it.  I asked myself about the point behind 29...Rb1+, as I didn't see much after 30.Rc1.  Well, there was, and this is where the distraction took over as I was thinking even exchange and doesn't achieve much.  Whereas, the promotion is a killer.  But, due to my Bh6, 30...Rc1# is checkmate.  In the future, I wish that Jack Stockel wouldn't just move or change things around as that's how I overlook these things since I consider it extremely distracting.} 30. Rxf2 a5 {But, Jack said that it's lost, and Ted resigned.  I agreed with Jack.  The plan behind the R sac for this move is that I was planning something like 31...Ra6 and after 32.Ra2, I'd have 32...b6.  And, I keep using those pawns chains one by one where each advances one square until I've promoted.  But, I forgot that after 33.Bf1, I'm now forced to retreat.  In fact, he could even stop those variations with 31.Bf1.  After which, even after moving my R and playing something like a later ...b6, he has Ra2.  The only thing that would help is ...Rd5+, but Ted can block with something like Rd2.  And, in some of these variations he would have an advantage.  Ted and I just didn't realize due to the distractions.  But, Jack then said that after 27...Bh7, white was hopeless.  It's true, and I don't even mind him watching or commenting after the game to coach us.  But, what I didn't enjoy was him getting involved and changing things around before the end of game.  I guess it is good practice.  And, what I've got to learn and get better is knowing how to overcome these distractions.  As that way, I won't miss something like 29...Rb1+ which would've mated, at once.}
