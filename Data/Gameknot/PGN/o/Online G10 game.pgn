1. Nf3 {I like Nf3 because it is very flexible.} Nf6 {Black maintains flexibility also} 2. c4 {Usually it's good to place at least 1 pawn in the center during the opening.} b6 3. g3 {I thought countering Black's fianchetto was the best option} Ba6 {Black doesn't fianchetto, and instead attacks my c-pawn. I thought d3 was too committal here since I might want to play d4 later. b3 is better since at least it prepares Bb2.} 4. b3 e6 5. Bg2 Bb7 {I think d5 is better than wasting a tempo} 6. d4 {This probably wasn't the strongest move, castling or Bb2 were probably better options.} Bb4+ 7. Nbd2 {blunder, I missed Black's tactic and now I lose a pawn. I should've played Bd2} Bc3 {This is why I should've fianchettoed my bishop instead of playing the dubious d4.} 8. Rb1 Bxd4 {My position isn't losing yet, since I'm only down a pawn, and I might have some compensation since I gain tempo chasing Black's bishop.} 9. O-O {This relieves the pressure on the diagonal while threatening the bishop} Bc5 10. b4 Be7 11. Bb2 {I am slightly ahead in development, and after Qc2 I am directing pressure toward the kingside, but Black should be able to secure his pawn advantage and figure out a way to trade off into a winning endgame later.} O-O {Bxb4 loses a piece to Bxf6.} 12. Qc2 g6 {Black wants to block this diagonal, but this is very weakening to the dark squares near his king, which strengthens my dark bishop} 13. Bc3 d6 14. Rfd1 {The slight compensation I have for the blundered pawn should die away soon, but Black didn't seem to find any room for expansion, does anyone see a plan for Black here? or should he defend passively to safely secure his pawn?} Nbd7 15. Nd4 {I have the initiative on the light squares, so Black should trade.} Bxg2 16. Kxg2 Qc8 {Black should pay more attention to the c6-weakness, but he believes that his pressure on the long diagonal will be of more signifance when he replaces his fianchettoed bishop with the queen.} 17. Nc6 {Here my plan was to support the knight with b5 (a4 if needed) and try to squeeze Black and restrict his opportunities for expansion. } Qb7 {This is a losing blunder and suddenly I am winning. Even though pinning the knight to the king on the long diagonal seems strong, I have a totally unexpected move.} 18. Qe4 {This move must've shocked Black, and he took my queen instantly, had he just thought for a little, he would've realized he had to lose a piece and then tried the best defense for the best chance to swindle. Black cannot stop the double-threat of Ne7, which either takes the bishop or discovery checks the queen.} Nxe4 19.
