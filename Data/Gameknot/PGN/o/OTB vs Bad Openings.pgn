1. f3 {Hi all. Here is my ten-cents' worth from my past few games - although, looking at its quality, it probably doesn't even make 2 cents. It is a very short, and not particularly well-played, game. Just intended as a lesson to avoid playing certain openings...well, one opening in particular. In this game, during a lunch break, I am playing against my friend Hugo Mason in the calm and quiet of the library. And, unfortunately, as usual (??!?!?!?!?) Hugo uncorks his new favourite opening: the Hummuschluggg!!!! (have I got the spelling right?)} e5 {White's first move is weak: the main problem is that it does not help develop anything or improve White's position, so it gives to Black the initiative that White gets from having the first move. So, playing Black with a knowing grin, I play to dominate the centre, and take advantage of White's slow start by grabbing as much space as possible.} 2. Kf2 {Hence my knowing grin. I already know from experience that Hugo will continue like this. White's opening has gone from the weak to the horrific with this horrendously awful 2nd move. White has ticked all the "don't" boxes in the opening manuals: don't bring your king out early, don't waste time with pointless pawn moves, don't expose your position, etc. etc. Let's see how Black exploits White's awful opening.} d5 {Black grabs the centre. I know, from experience against Hugo as much as from knowing the principles, that, if Black grabs the centre now and opens up all his development lines, he will be able to develop extremely quickly, by developing a piece with check, White has to defend, Black develops again and gains a tempo, and so on. After this sequence, Black has a well-developed, powerful position, while White has a weak position after floundering around defending his king. Black can then expect to win with a quick attack.} 3. e4 {Bad move. In previous annotations in which the Hummuschluggg has been played (ask jstevens!!) White has followed up with 3.e3 4.g3, or 3.g3 4.e3. Both these moves do not develop, and therefore increase Black's chances of winning with quick development followed by an early attack. However, I can see the logic behind these moves: these close all the attack lines pointing towards White's king, allowing White to continue and develop in relative quiet for the next few moves, without any irritating checks. White's move here looks good initially, striking at the centre to try to deal with Black's control, however, it completely opens up the c5-f2 diagonal attack line, allowing me to attack down it.} Bc5+ {Black's developing-with-tempo sequence plan comes to fruition. Black now controls a lot of central space, has a lead in development, and has a very strong position to attack from. White is now completely lost - although some people will argue he was lost from 2.Kf2??. If 4.Ke1, 4...dxe4! 5.fxe4 Qh4+!! 6.Ke2 Qf2+ 7.Kd3 and White's exposed king will lose him the game soon enough. 4.Ke2 keeps the king in relative safety, however, White's position is too slow to develop, as the bishop and queen are blocked by the misplaced king on e1, and Black will be able to develop and attack, completely unhindered. And, finally, if 4.Kg3 - we'll soon see what happens. Nobody spoil the surprise! :-)} 4. Kg3 {Apart from anything else, this would have appealed to Hugo's rather over-imaginative sense of adventure. The heroic king, swashbucking across the board, leading his inspired army to victory: I can see the storybook potential of that. Hugo definitely would have liked that. However, Black has a reply that probably does not appeal to Hugo's sense of adventure at all:} Qg5# {Checkmate. The swashbuckling, heroic, inspiring, brave, courageous king is...dead. Stopped in his tracks. In 21st-century warfare, the king leads his army from the back: this is what chessplayers, namely Hugo, should learn. Let this be a lesson to all chess players: DO NOT play the Hummuschluggg Opening! It will only bring you pain!* (*Note to commentators and viewers: please, please, please do not tell slockster I said that!)}
