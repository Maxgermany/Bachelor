[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C78), ...b5 & ...d6"]

1. e4 {King's Pawn opening, my main opening even though as of recent I had played 1. d4, just to get a sense for closed and positional middlegames.} e5 {Standard response, second only to the Sicilian (1...c5). Black stakes claim to central squares in a symmetrical fashion. All kinds of games, from dynamic to drawish, can arise from this position.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Most common moves, 2. Nf3 attacks e5 and 2...Nc6 defends the pawn.} 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez. White develops his bishop to b5 as to challenge Black's control of e5 and d4. White can't quite win a pawn after 4. Bxc6, 4...dxc6, 5.Nxe5, since 5...Qd4 forks the knight and pawn, and wins back the material with a more favorable position.} a6 {Most popular move, black seeks to rid the bishop immediately.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 {Chasing my bishop again.} 6. Bb3 d6 {Securing e5, but leaving weaknesses on c6, e6, and especially d5} 7. Nc3 {?! I was kind of running on a tired auto-pilot here, and instead of playing sensible moves like 7. Re1 or 7. c3, I went for this move. It's not really bad, just unusual, and I am unfamiliar with this line. However I will try to make the best of the position} Be7 8. Nd5 {Trying to exchange the bishop and win the bishop pair.} Na5 {Black seeks to rid my bishop as well, a sensible move.} 9. Nxe7 Qxe7 10. d4 {Attacking in the center, usually pushing d4 in an e4 opening successfully is a sign of slight advantage.} Nxb3 11. axb3 {Bishops have been exchanged and the position is closed, so right now the game doesn't look like it carries any more fire. However my somewhat weird 7. Nc3 required my opponent to think a bit, which left me a slight time advantage at this point. Seeing as I like to look for imbalances (I'm a Silman kind of guy), I decide to play off that imbalance.} Nxe4 {From move 5 I intended to give this pawn up (temporarily) anyway, so I'm not bothered by this.} 12. dxe5 Bb7 {My opponent wisely does not recapture this pawn, as 12...dxe5, 13. Qd5 would fork the knight and the rook.} 13. exd6 Qxd6 14. Qxd6 cxd6 15. Rd1 {Attacking the isolated pawn.} O-O 16. Nd4 {Improving my knight, and planning 17. Nf5 to attack the pawn again.} d5 {My opponent advances the pawn to escape the fire, but now he leaves more weak squares.} 17. Bf4 {Finally developing my poor dark squared bishop.} Rfe8 {This game looks as if it might be heading towards a draw, but my opponent had done a fair bit of calculating at this point and I had a significant time advantage. Noticing this, I spent a minute calculating an interesting pawn sacrifice that might not necessarily leave me with excellent compensation, but would require my opponent to make calculated, defensive moves, which is what I needed having the time advantage.} 18. c4 {!? The pawn sacrifice, lashing out in an attempt to open lines. Might not be best play, but certain situations don't always call for the most obvious moves.} dxc4 19. bxc4 bxc4 {My opponent takes the pawn, but now I have targets to attack!} 20. Rac1 {Attacking the weak, undefended pawn.} Rac8 {Defending said pawn.} 21. f3 {Kicking the knight, at this point I'm trying my best to exaggerate the initiative.} Nf6 22. Nf5 {! Threatening 23. Nd6 where I would be forking the two rooks, the bishop and the pawn on c4. I had already calculated up to this point from 18. c4, so I had been spewing moves out, while my opponent was taking time to think about them. My opponent's time was already running quite thin (at least under a minute), and with this move he would certainly have to take another chunk of time to think of a proper defense.} Nd5 {Good move, prolong Nd6 due to attack on the bishop. However, he spent another good amount of time on this move, as I intended.} 23. Bg3 {24. Nd6 is still in the air} Red8 {Another good defense, now after Nd6 he could just play either 24...Rc7 or 24...Rb8 and almost all ends would be tied up. However, my opponent now had mere seconds, so all I had to do was play it out until time either caused him to blunder, or cost him the game.} 24. Nd6 {Playing it anyway, and now I will at least regain the pawn I sacrificed. After this move my opponent exhausted what little time he had and lost, so I plugged the position into Houdini. Best play line that was given went: 24...Rc7, 25 Nxc4, 25...Rcd7, 26. Ne5, and white came out with a slight advantage (around 0.25 of a point for you numbers people). In this game I hope I showed that if a position seems dead drawn to you, look for other factors to play off of, and in blitz games or a tournament setting, the clock can be a huge factor. When one has the time advantage, he should take the time to calculate complicated (but not losing) lines where his opponent will have to think hard to create a defense while you calmly move your pieces right after his. I hope you enjoyed this annotation!}
