1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 Na5 {So, we start with the mainlines of the Spanish Opening.} 6. Nxe5 {Instead of exchanging pawns, right away, I deviate from mainlines and take right away on e5.  I was interested on how Ted would respond.} Nxb3 7. axb3 Bd6 {? But, he played this.  Better was 7...Qe7 as this would've given him back a pawn.} 8. Nf3 Be7 {I don't know why he played.} 9. O-O {But, it doesn't matter to me, as I castle.} Bb7 {Continuing with his development.} 10. Nc3 {So do I.} b4 {Attacking my N.} 11. Nd5 {And, I defend.  Since this was still before the lesson with Ken, I have exchanging pieces in mind just for the thrills and giggles.  Now, I know better, however, then to do that.} Bxd5 12. exd5 c5 {I don't know why Ted played, but I'll just go ahead of it and exchange pawns.} 13. dxc6 e.p. dxc6 14. Qe2 {With the idea of pinning his Be7.  Now, Ted is faced with pressure since his K side is not completely developed, yet, which means that he also has not castled.} Nf6 {? Now, he develops, but this would've been better a move earlier since 14...Qb6 would've been his best move here.  That's because Ted is now going to lose another pawn.} 15. Rxa6 O-O {? Castling also would've been better earlier because the best move was 15...Qc7 here as he is going to lose, yet, another pawn.} 16. Rxc6 Qd7 {Attacking my Rook.} 17. Ne5 {So, I defend, whilst, attacking his Queen, instead.} h5 {?? I don't know why played this.  But, it's the losing blunder, as now I'm going to win his Queen, without compensation.} 18. Nxd7 {Knowing that, Ted resigned here.}
