1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Like game 2, it's another Nimzo, though this time with a somewhat different atmosphere...} 4. Bd2 {Not the most common. This does break the pin, but is less forcing in my opinion than other lines, allowing black easy equality. I tried to remember the theory (and failed!) which suggests: 4...0-0; 5. a3 Bxc3 6. Bxc3 Ne4! which forces white to expend an extra tempo if he wants to keep the bishop pair.} c5 {This standard Nimzo move is also fine however.} 5. a3 {Asking the question. I considered Ba5, but it does very little, since I will likely exchange on c3 anyway at some point. 5...cxd4 6.axb4 dxc3 7. Bxc3 gives white more central control.} Bxc3 6. Bxc3 {Avoiding doubled pawns which would also leave the d2 bishop on a slightly passive square.} Ne4 {The same idea as the note to move 4. White will need to decide how much he wants the two bishops, whilst the knight sits happily on its good central square.} 7. Qc2 {Note that 7. f3 is terrible after Qh4+!} f5 {Wanting to keep the knight on e4 - the other way to defend the knight would be d5, which is also fine. The only slight problem with f5 is that the c8 bishop will need to a little time to get in the game, and is, technically, a "bad bishop".} 8. dxc5 {The first slight mistake by white. The doubled pawns are weak, whilst the ds bishop looks powerful, it can always be exchanged off, negating the advantage.} O-O {I thought about letting g7 drop, but there is no compensation. The other alternative would be Qe7, but I felt development would be better.} 9. b4 {Here I wondered if I had overestimated the weakness of the doubled pawns, as that wedge is quite intimidating! That said, I can take advantage of white's lagging development to undermine the phalanx, weakening it further.} a5 {Trying to force b5, where c5 would suddenly become weak again, though this does look like the best line for white - 10. b5 b6; 11. cxb6 Qxb6; 12. e3 Bb7 and black has the edge through development and a sitting duck in the form of the backward pawn on c4. Also in passing, bxa5 is a disaster after Rxa5! When 11. Bxa5 Qxa5+; 12. Kd1 Nxf2+ is very nasty.} 10. Qb2 {Trying to complicate, whilst protecting the rook (which could have been the object of some a-file tactics if undefended). But it is another queen move, and white needs to develop.} axb4 {11. Bxg7 loses a piece after 11...bxa3; 12. Rxa3 Rxa3: 13. Qxa3 Kxg7. I anticipated 11. axb4 which I think to be best and probably equal after 11...Rxa1; Qxa1 where black can choose from Nxc3, Nc6 or b6.} 11. Bxb4 {The c-pawns become doubled and isolated. That I am supposedly a pawn down is laughable!} Nc6 {Again seeing whether white will want to hang onto the bishop (to take advantage of black's weak dark squares) though perhaps the immediate b6 was more accurate. This intermediary move block the advance of the c-pawn, and the potential discovered attack on the f8 rook.} 12. e3 {To get the ls bishop into the game.} b6 {To get my ls bishop into the game, honing in on the c4 pawn after Ba6, or taking the long diagonal. After cxb6 Qxb6, the b4 bishop is also pinned to the queen (and cannot play Bxf8).} 13. Bd3 bxc5 {Most active, and setting up a cheap tactic. I consdered Nxc5, which would force the exchange of minor pieces, but I preferred the activity generated by keeping the pieces on the board.} 14. Bxe4 fxe4 {After the game, my opponent mentioned he expected cxb4, followed by Bxc6 dxc6 and axb4. That looks ok, but this looks better, with a promising open f-file.} 15. Bxc5 {The losing move. Either Bd2 or Bc3 was necessary, where 15...Qg5; 16. g3 Ba6 followed by playing Qf5 ties white up in knots.} Qa5+ {The end.} 16. Qd2 {Other ways to drop a piece (or worse) include a Bb4 or a king move.} Qxc5 {The game is not so interesting now, but I shall play it through for completeness' sake.} 17. Qc3 Ne5 {Eying a very nice outpost, and attacking c4 again.} 18. Ne2 Nd3+ {Much stronger than grabbing the pawn - white's king must be confined to the centre.} 19. Kd2 Rxf2 20. h4 {Hope springs eternal.} Qa5 {Exchanging so there is no hint of an attack. If Rxg2 for example, then a rook to g1 would pin black's rook to mate on g7.} 21. Qxa5 Rxa5 22. g4 Ba6 {The bishop finally moves!} 23. h5 Bxc4 24. h6 g6 {White finally threw in the towel here. Once again, thank-you for your time in having a look, and as ever all comments, analysis etc are most welcome!}
