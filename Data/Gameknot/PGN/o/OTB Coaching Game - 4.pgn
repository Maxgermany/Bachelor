[Opening "Sicilian (B20), Gloria variation"]

1. e4 {Like me, Mary's favorite is also the KPO.  And, of course, I answer with the Siclian Defense.} c5 2. c4 {After the discussion last week, I anticipated 2.Nf3  But, she made a very good point when I called it an inaccuracy.  Since I felt that I was being a little critical, last week, I wasn't going to say anything, this time.} d6 {So, I continue with my defense.} 3. d3 {?! At this point, a small conversation ensues, as I implied that this was an inaccuracy.  I didn't want to get into a lot of details because, even though Jack is not there, talking too much would distract, which I (inadvertently) due later on and feel very bad about.  Joe: Putting limits on the LSB  Mary: What's that?  Joe: In other words, it restricts your LSB.  What I mean is that her Bf1 is confined to only one square which is e2  It's not a bad bishop, but it won't be as welled placed, as a result.  And, the idea being is that you don't want to, voluntarily tie down your own pieces which I'm afraid that she has done.  } Nc6 {Meanwhile, I continue developing.} 4. f4 {?! I wasn't going to say anything, right away, as sometimes, you can get the f pawn into play.  And, I thought (especially due to not being that energetic) that she was defending a pawn.  However, I got the colors mixed up, as otherwise, I would've said something, immediately.  But, later on, I will imply it, when a difficult situation arises for her.  It is very much worth noting that it falls, pretty much, into the same category as the Domino's Defense, or what tactical-abyss notes in his Q sac.  You should not, voluntarily, remove the f pawn because f2 and f7 are considered the weakest squares on the chess board.  Once that pawn is removed, you often wind up in trouble.} Nf6 {Taking advantage of a potential weakness, I continue developing.} 5. Nf3 {So does she.} Bg4 {But, with that being said, I decided to do more by pinning her N, in the process.} 6. h3 {Now, I asked myself what could be done here.  } Bxf3 {I actually thought that the only other option was retreating to h4.  But, I was not going to it, this time.  Unlike before, this would've lost a piece.  With that being said, if 6...Bh5?? 7.g4, Bg6, and after 8.f5 my B is trapped.  Therefore, I thought that this was my only choice.  But, after reanalyzing this, I realize that 6...Bd7  But, even so, I like this the best, and therefore, would've played it.  The idea being is that if I went to d7, my K and Q would, be somwhat, crammed in.  And, I would be in a little bit of an uncomfortable position.  By playing this, we go into a different exchange variation that I happen to like.} 7. Qxf3 Nd4 {That is because I respond with this.  And, the idea, as I note on the next move is to punish black for bringing out her f pawn early, as opposed to, continue developing.} 8. Qg3 {?? However, this is a blunder which I will later note.} Nc2+ {Mary: This is not a good position.  Joe: The problem is that your pieces are not developed.  So, there are not a lot of options, in this position.  I said that to emphasize the points that Jack has made.  In fact last week, he emphasized how important it is for her to follow General Opening Guidelines which I said in my last win with her.   That is, to develop your pieces, control the center, and get the K to safety.  As she said, which I nodded, (after the game was over) what made things difficult was the opening, itself.  In fact, just before I joined this website, come to think of it, this is something that he told me, as well.  And, I tell that to some of my students, and all of them remember this.  But, then something occurs, as she could've protected her R.  Seeing this, I said something after taking.  Meanwhile, Mary decides to attack my N before I take which I find quite smart, as you might as well get aggressive.} 9. Kd1 Nxa1 {So, it was at this point where I realized that I made a mistake in my coaching and told her how that R could've been protected.  In it, I said, best was 8.Qf2 which would've prevented my Knight from coming on the second rank.  This implies that, as a result, I couldn't have gotten the Rook, and she nodded her head.} 10. e5 {Going after my N, which will soon be under attack, anyhow.  So, I decide to exchange pawns, first.  That's because my plan is to do something nasty.  However, I did not realize it was unsound.  My thinking was that she would have more difficulties, but this is where my lack of energy gets the best of me.  It's important to note that on this day, it was atypical November weather.  Not only was it cloudy and a little rainy, but it was quite muggy and disgusting, in the process.  We were near record temps, and a lot of people were feeling this affect.  But, in this process, I made a terrible miscalculation.} dxe5 11. fxe5 Ne4 {?? With that being said, it starts here.  With that being said, the reason I exchanged was to land my N here, and create a nasty threat by putting pressure right on the Q.  Of course, my idea was defending the N, and in the process of gaining tempo, I could complete my development and castle.  But, with this move, however, she is going to win back my N which I'm not proud of this mistake, at all.  In addition, 11...Nd7 came to mind, but I felt that my N would be crammed and would then lose more time, especially since bringing back near the homesquare puts me in uncomfortable position.  The idea being is that I was counting the fact that my Q side would be limited which I didn't want, and I was basing on a past game.  However, I had to move the N back to either d7 or g8, as this was the only protect it.   } 12. Qf3 {This is how she will do it.  As, no matter where I go, she can take.  Now, I thought I had one way out.} Ng5 {But, I overlooked the DSB.  No matter how you look at it, how she was going to get it, and with my N trapped on a1, she is going to win that (thus) recompensating for lost material.} 13. Bxg5 Rb8 {After that blunder, to prevent any further loss, I saw that b7 was en-prise and asked how to protect it.  I also considered 13...b7, which at the time, I thought I'd lose my R, if I did so.  Of course, I forgot about my Qd8 (which is directly affiliated with how tired I was, on that day).  That would've also protected and given my a nice pawn chain.  But, had this not been overlooked, I still would've played this, regardless.  The idea being is that, had I protected the other way, I would've lost castling rights.  For example, 13...b7 14.Qc6+, Qb7 15.Qxb7, Kxb7  With that another small chat ensues.  Mary: Darn!  Joe: I had to protect b7.  Mary: You could afford it.  But, I shook my head no.  Yes, I'm still ahead, but I refuse to give anything else away, voluntarily.} 14. Bf4 {Her plan involves going after my R.  That is because would advance, her e5, so that I'd be forced to give up a pawn to avoid losing a R for B, which I won't allow.} e6 {Therefore, I find the only move to stop this.  I also looked at 14...Qxd3+ to stop but didn't consider this move.  Although a little tired, I wasn't severely fatigued or dizzy, for had I been that super blunder would've been, extremely likely.} 15. Nc3 {Preparing to win my N, which I know can't be defended.} Qd4 {I also looked at 15...Qa5 and 15...Qb4, with the idea of knabbing one of those pawns.  But, white Mary would be able to defend with her N.  Had I been better, I might have played one of those two candidate moves.  But, I decided to respond with this, thinking that her Nc3 is indirectly pinned.  It appears that moving it would lose a pawn, but she can still defend this with 16.Na4} 16. Be3 {? But, she goes after my Q.  Joe: This isn't the best move because I can win another pawn.  Better was to leave your Bishop on f5 where that pawn was protected, and she nodded her head.} Qxe5 17. Kc1 {But, once Mary played this, that's when I realized that she would equalize by winning my other N.} g5 {Due to limits on my concentration, I was worried that Mary might have threats against me, and was determined to prevent it.  Otherwise, I would've done the standard fianchetto with 17...g6  Come to think of it, what concerned me was white strengthening her pawn chain on g2 and h3.  With this move, after g5, she can't advance further.  And, what I also bared in mind is that she would not take on g5, due to my Q.} 18. Kb1 Bg7 {Knowing that she is going my N, I decide to complete development.  And, when Mary takes, that's when I'll castle, at once.} 19. Kxa1 O-O 20. g4 {And, Mary advances, afterall.  So, I feel that 17...g5 was the right decision, but it is important to know since pawn chains are of my concern, that, this is one of the few positions where it would not have been a major asset.  For example, before it advanced, with my g pawn, she would not have gotten a passed pawn which is what went through my mind.} Rfd8 {Remembering what happened in my game against bhdiragon, (and thus) bearing in mind that Mary's Q is cut off from her DSB making it out of play, I decide to go right after d3 pawn.  That is especially because we're nearing the endgame and bearing that I'm her teacher, I'm doing whatever I can to prevent her from forcing a win, despite the one mistake which does this.} 21. h4 {But, she finds an interesting way to protect it.  Now, I had a hard time evaluating between taking right away on d3 or not.  The only reason why I didn't is the fact it's protected by her LSB.  The interesting fact is that I almost overlooked this, and therefore, came close to losing a R for a pawn.  After ruling it out, exchanging on h4 came to mind, but taking there would leave Mary with an open h file, which I wasn't going allow.  And, that was, of course, with one of TA's unusual Q sacs.  He sacked in an unusual spot and won.  One of the main reasons is because he allowed Joe to maintain an open h file, which was used to his advantage. } f5 {Therefore, I decide to exchange this way.  What I had anticipated was 22.gxf5, in which I'd recapture with 22...exf5  In fact, this was her best move.} 22. Bxg5 {?? Now I didn't say anything right away because you can't necessarily prove one thing right away, in this position.  But, later on, I imply that this was a blunder.  At first, I thought that this was a good move because I was thinking about how to protect Rd8.  Then, it occured to me that this was no of concern because of my next move, which would not have been possible, if she did not remove her Be3.} Qe1+ {Bearing in mind that Mary can't use her K to get out.  And, once she does, I will take another pawn.  That's because I have a plan, when she takes back.  But, in this position, what do I intend to do.} 23. Nd1 fxg4 24. Qxg4 Rd4 {And, with her next move, I'll reattack, thus, adding pressure to the first rank which was my plan.  Of course, she can move her Q elsewhere, but that would limit her options.  For example, 25.Qh5 limits her mobility which also makes the situation difficult.  Therefore, I said, interesting position.  By letting me place you in check, you wound up in trouble.  By this, I'm indirectly pointed out why, 22.Bxg5? was a mistake.  But, Mary understood what I was getting at because she nodded her head.} 25. Qf3 {But, with this move, however, I will reattack, adding more pressure against the first rank.} Rf8 {Mary: Persistent, aren't we?  Joe: Yep.} 26. Qh5 {At first, I was going to tell Mary that was a better move.  I was thinking, 26.Qe2, to protect the N.  But, I stopped myself from saying anything, as the last part of the Q's diagnol involves d1.  Therefore, her N was a goner, one way or another.  In fact, no matter what she goes, I will win more material, even after taking.} Rxf1 27. Qe8+ {But, Mary prolongs the capture by placing me in check, as my next move will be forced.  After that, whether she takes or not, I win more material.  The idea being, is that if she doesn't take on f1, then I will.    } Bf8 28. Rxf1 Qxf1 29. Qxe6+ {That, however, does not stop Mary from getting another pawn.  Now, I looked at different options.  However, there was only one other move, which I strongly considered and almost played.  That was, 29...Kh8 and the idea being is what Jack said about how important it is to bring your monarch into the corner.  However, it doesn't work here.  If I had played that, she would won a piece, and this time, without compensation.  That is especially because we're in the endgame.  So, if 29...Kh8??, 30.Bf6+, and after 30...Qxf6, 31.Qxf6, losing the Q for her DSB. } Qf7 {Therefore, this was the only other alternative.  In fact, I wouldn't mind exchanging Q's here.} 30. Qc8 {But, Mary doesn't accept.  Given, however, that her d3 is still boxed in and can't escape, I decide to it.  Afterall this wins another pawn.  Of course, I still need to watch my back, as we're about to see.  This is due to not just the tactics she used two weeks ago, but how she's playing now (espeically since Jack isn't there to help her out).} Rxd3 31. Qg4 {The idea is to protect d1.  But, what Mary doesn't know is that her N cannot be defended, due to my next move.} Qf1 {And, that is due to the extra attacker I have on f1.  With that being said, this move, is going to prevent her from taking back, when I capture on d1.} 32. a3 {But, having had figured out what's going on and the threat that ensues afterwards, Mary makes the right choice and opens up.  The idea being is that if she didn't do so, then what I mentioned would've become a mate.  So, that would've been 32...Rxd1+, 33.Qxd1 (forced), Qxd1#  And, after this game, we discussed it, and she implied that she saw this threat by saying that if this move wasn't played, I would've mated.  And, I told her that she was right.  In fact, I was very impressed by this comment because it shows improvement.  Before, this student has missed similar back rank threats.  It's also worth noting that white is taking a lot of time as there was only enough time for this game, last Friday.} Rxd1+ 33. Ka2 Ra1+ {Given that the last move was forced, I decided to play this.  Believe it or not, I am thinking of a long term mating threat.  But, seeing that her next move forced I realized that I couldn't.} 34. Kb3 Qb1 {?? But, at this is 11:48 a.m., and due to my work schedule, I have no choice but to leave by noon.  How I knew is that we both looked at our watch, so time management was becoming an issue.  In this case, Mary also had to leave at noon.  So, I figured that I'd put pressure on her, and then go for mate.  But, with the situation that I mentioned, I didn't take enough to focus on the situation, so it became Flip Coin Chess, as opposed to, Real Chess.  Consequently, this loses.  For a while, I asked if there was anything I could've done differently, and believe it or not, got distracted at work trying to think about it.  Sure, visualization is a good thing, but too much of a good thing can be bad.  At first, I thought that there was just too many mistakes from me feeling bad.  Then, I looked back and got the reflection on how well Mary did, and realize that one of the pieces she won was not due to a blunder.  Instead, it was stuck because if I moved it past the 8th rank, she would've taken, regardless.  But, with this move, I'm in a lot of trouble, after how white responds.  With that being said, best was 34...Qd1+, in which forces white to liquidate while I'm ahead.  From there, I should win.  But, the only problem is that, when the game was over, there was less then 10 minutes to spare.  So, I had I played it right, I think we would've assumed that I won.  But, it would still be unfinished.  Therefore, I would've recorded this as still in progress, as opposed to, 1-0.  As a result, this was better, in a way, because we got to, at least finish the game.} 35. Qe6+ {?? At this point, we were down to only 10 minutes.  Taking a lot more time would've exceeded this.  So, I only spent a minute or two to analyze, in order to prevent the game from timing out.  The only move I considered, though, was 35...Kh8  This time, however, it was due to Jack's advice of bringing your monarch into the corner, as it's part of K safety.  After the game, I asked myself, if there were any other options.  The answer is that there was only one other move which also leads to mate.  It was 35...Kg7, and I would've lasted longer because after 36.Bf6+, I can play 36...Bh6  But, I am almost convinced that white would still mate, sooner or later.  Bringing my K to h8, is going to allow white to mate me, much sooner.} Kh8 36. Bf6+ {Now, we were down to 8 minutes, and after this move I resigned.  In the end, we discussed why I was resigning, and, at first, Mary thought that resignation was premature.  I showed her the reason that it wasn't.  So, the first thing I told her was that my K cannot move which she agreed.  Therefore, I'm only left with one move which is 36...Bg7, after that she showed me how she would've responded, and that was 37.Qe8#  So, when she did, I said that it would be mate.  Mary said, "Oh yeah, I see."  In the end, my student was thankful and told me that she learned a lot in this game, thus, implying that I'm also a good teacher.  The main thing that Mary mentioned was what went wrong in the opening.  In it, she said the opening is what got her into trouble.  And, I nodded with a happy face because of what Jack has said.  By mentioning that, she is starting to connect the dots and see the big picture by understanding why following the basic openings is important.  She also mentioned something else which made me smile.  It was the fact that white had to open up with 32.a3 and recognized that I would've mated on the back rank, if she had not done that.  And, I told her that this would've happened to point out that she's right.  With that being said, given that this student has made progress, if I play her again, it will be like how it was with bhidragon.  So, next time, I won't make any comment, even if a mistake or blunder is made.  And, after it's over, we'll analyze, so it'll be like a rated game.  In addition, as noted, since the main coach wasn't there and making changes we discussed a little more.  Therefore, as sonata296 accurately stated in my last game against her, this time, it did distract the other players that were there which I felt bad about.  However, if she has a question, I feel that I must answer.  But, I'll be, as brief as possible.  Refusing to answer the questions, in my opinion is an equivalent to putting someone on your ignore list for no good reason, which is against my moral.  On the other hand, the chat's will be limited, as much as possible.  This is due to the distraction that occurred and the fact that Mary's become so good.  Therefore, I want to see what she will do, when I don't say anything.}
