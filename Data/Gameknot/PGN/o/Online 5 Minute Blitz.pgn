1. e4 {A 5 minute blitz game where I start to slightly panic due to low time, but some hasty sacrifices later, I produce a stunning checkmate. (The ratings are so low because it's a different site, with a weird rating system... 120 is around the 70th percentile, and 67 is around 45th percentile. I had just started)} e5 {King's Pawn Opening} 2. Nf3 {Standard reply (I no likey el Kings gambit...)} d6 {Now this kinda set me back. I was use to Nc6, so I lost a couple seconds wondering about it, then realized that it was nothing new, and continued on with the game.} 3. Bc4 {Hoping for a Legallo's mate} h6 4. Nc3 a5 {Much better response than Bg4. After 5. Nxe5 Bxd1 6. Bxf7  Ke7 its mate with 7. Nd5#. However, it still sucks.} 5. d4 {I'm an avid Scotch player, so now that my hope for Legallo's mate ended, I decide to bring it to territory which I am somewhat more famaliar to.} exd4 6. Nxd4 {6. Qxd4? loses tempo from 6. ... Nc6} Nf6 7. Qf3 {Hoping that he will move his knight so I can checkmate with Qxf7. I didn't think of the possibility of ... Bg4 until after I moved.} h5 {? I think he was preparing ... Bg4, but the instant ... Bg4 would be far better.} 8. h3 {Preventing ... Bg4} Bd7 {The only good space for this bishop; ... b6, ... Bg7 could take too long} 9. Bg5 {Hoping to exchange of f6 while ruining his kingside} Be7 {Getting rid of the pin and keeping kingside castling a viable option} 10. Bxf6 {Thinking that when he retook, I could just offer the knight of d4 for mate, but it was really just a fool's hope} Bxf6 11. O-O-O {?! I realized after this move I just completely screwed my previous plan of the "free" knight on d4... yay me.} Nc6 {Attacking the knight of d4 and looking at e5} 12. Nf5 {Hoping for Nxg7 } Ne5 {Didn't notice this until after he moved it.} 13. Qe2 {I need to protect the bishop...} g6 14. Nxd6+ {I could have just moved him to g3, but there he would be kind of passive, this turned out fo be much stronger in the end} cxd6 15. Rxd6 {I was starting to fall behind on time, and started to make hasty decisions. I do not know if this is a bad move, or a good one. (I don't have Fritz or anything of that sort)} Qe7 16. Rb6 Qc5 {16. ... Bc6 looks better, because then my rook is pretty much stuck and useless, and it moves the bishop to a slightly more useful square} 17. Rxf6 {The only good move} Nxc4 {Here was when I first realized I was down a bishop to a pawn, and started to slightly panic} 18. Rd1 {Moving for 19. Rd5, and hoping to recover a piece, or just start to mess with the king} Be6 {Kind of messing my plan up and somewhat cutting of my escape squares with the rook} 19. f4 {20. f5 is looking pretty nice right now} O-O 20. f5 {This forces the king to start to expose itself, or lose the piece advantage.} Kg7 {The king decides to move. } 21. fxe6 {I was under a minute here, and didn't want to think very long on my next move, I was able to realize that this could show some strong attacking options, so I just took with out really considering the consequences, either way, my rook was really just lost.} Kxf6 22. Nd5+ {Starting to put pressure here} Kxe6 23. Nf4+ {Moving for perpetual check} Kf6 24. e5+ {I change my plan though, hoping to draw the king out even further} Nxe5 {24. ... Kg7 doesn't end to well after 25. e6 fxe6 26. Nxe6 loses the queen, or the king side starts to break open after any move for 25. ... __, 26 exf7 (I realize I am probably really inaccurate with that last comment...)} 25. Nd5+ {Going for perpetual check again} Ke6 26. Nf4+ Kf6 27. Nd5+ Ke6 28. Nf4+ Kf5 {Black realizes his advantage and decides against taking the draw.} 29. g4+ {Another sacrifice.  29. ... Kxf4 30. Rf3  Kg5 31. Qd2  Kh4, and the king is trapped, and will be hard to rescue} hxg4 30. hxg4+ Kxf4 {?? This leads to checkmate. Better would have been (in my opinion, which is probably wrong) 30. ... Kf6 Nd5  and the king can retreat to g7} 31. Rf1+ {Step one: Eliminate the escape routes} Kg5 32. Qd2+ {Step two: Elimate more escape routes, and trap the king (feel free to offer more material =P)} Kxg4 33. Qf4+ {Step three: Force the king into his coffin} Kh5 34. Rh1# {Step four: Give the killing blow, and close the coffin.   A full two rooks, a knight, and a pawn down, White checkmates.}
