[Opening "Philidor (C41), exchange variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The Philidor Defence has become one of my favourite openings to play against, perhaps because I haven't really faced it when played well. Usually, I end up with plenty of options against it, and get to develop faster.} 3. d4 {I play the most common response, d4, and open up the centre.} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 {I figured that if I'd played 5. Nxc6, Black would have put significant pressure on d5, after bxc6. Black could then follow with 6... d5, disrupting my centre. I didn't want that to happen, so I decided to develop instead.} Nxd4 6. Qxd4 Nf6 {I was expecting Black to try to force my queen out with tempo, by playing something along the lines of c5. But in hindsight, that would have caused issues for the development of Black's DSB. I'm actually not too sure what Black's best option would have been here, so if someone in the comments could help, that'd be wonderful.} 7. Bg5 {I considered 7. e5 for a few moments at this point, but decided not to, as I was unsure whether the tempo gained after 7. e5 dxe5 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. O-O-O+ would be worth the lost pawn. Instead, I decided to put an extra attacker against the knight, with the intention of capturing it to double Black's pawns.} h6 {This move didn't work out too well for Black, as it only attacked a piece I was planning to move the following turn. Perhaps 7... Be7 would have been better.} 8. Bxf6 gxf6 9. Bc4 {Putting pressure on f7. Note the difference in development.} Bg7 {I'm not too sure what Black intended here. The DSB is not well placed here, with pawns blocking its avenues of attack. Perhaps Black hoped to follow with f5, attempting to lure me into exf5 before Bxd4. Actually, while typing this, I realise that black may have wanted to castle, although the position of a castled king would seem weak here.} 10. Qd5 {This move was not my best work, to say the least. I think I got greedy, and thought I could get away with a quick mate at f7. This ends up handing my opponent a free move, due to the time I must now spend retreating my queen.} Be6 11. Qb5+ {Another move would have been better for me here, as this seems to just hand Black a free c6, which gives them the centre control they desire.} c6 12. Qb3 {The threat has now been refocused onto e6, although Black has many responses.} d5 {A challenger approaches...} 13. exd5 cxd5 14. O-O-O {Pinning the d5 pawn to the Black queen, thus indirectly protecting my LSB.} f5 {This seems like a good move to me, as it opens up a diagonal for the DSB, while threatening 14... Qg5+ 15. Kb1 dxc4, winning my bishop.} 15. Rhe1 {?? Not noticing the threat, I pin the LSB to the king, hoping to win a pawn with 16. Bxd5.} O-O {?? Failing to capitalise on the opportunity.} 16. Bxd5 {Now the ship has sailed.} Bxd5 17. Nxd5 Qg5+ 18. Ne3 {This doesn't seem to be my best option, as Black can play 18... f4. Kb1 seems better.} Rac8 {Rfe8 or Rae8 both seem better than this.} 19. h3 {An annoying misclick; I'd meant to play g3, preventing f4 and allowing h4 later on. For those wondering, I didn't play Qxb7, as Black wins the pawn back after Rb8.} f4 20. Nd5 a5 {?? f3+ is a far better move. This does nothing, and loses material.} 21. Ne7+ Kh8 22. Nxc8 Rxc8 23. Qxf7 Rf8 {Attempting in vain to force my queen away.} 24. Re8 {Pinning the rook to the king. It's lost.} f3+ {The long-awaited move, but too late.} 25. Kb1 fxg2 26. Rxf8+ {It's the end for black.} Bxf8 27. Qxf8+ Qg8 {The mate was already forced, but this makes it a mate in two.} 28. Qxh6+ {Forcing Qh7.} Qh7 29. Rd8# {Checkmate. It's an elegant finish to an interesting game. If you have any feedback, feel free to comment!}
