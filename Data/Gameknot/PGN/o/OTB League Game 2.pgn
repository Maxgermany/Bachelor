1. c4 {Hi everyone! Analysing your games and seeing where you make mistakes is a crucial aspect of chess improvement, so I am going to be having a look at all the games I'm playing at longplay time limits this season. I hope you enjoy them, and I would welcome all suggestions, criticisms etc, as my negligible chess abilities will no doubt have missed something. Thank-you all for taking the time to have a look! N.B. I apologise for all the anglicised bits (including spelling, dates etc) - not that it really matters.} Nf6 2. d4 {Allowing me to transpose back to a QP opening (my normal strategy when faced with the English)} e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Bd3 Bb7 6. Nf3 Ne4 7. Qc2 f5 8. O-O Bxc3 9. bxc3 O-O {The previous moves have all followed opening theory (4.b6 variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo-Indian, if you want to be precise) up to this point. I shall take a moment to outline the plans for both sides. For white, he must try to take advantage of the imbalance in the position of the two bishops, by opening up the position by virtue of a pawn break (such as c5/d5) or retreating the knight and playing f3, preparing to set up a big centre.  Black on the other hand must seek to keep the position closed, which will favour his knights, and try to combine the mobile kingside pawns, the potential attacking formation of swinging the rook across (f6 - g6/h6) combined with the ls bishop could put white in trouble.} 10. a4 {I wasn't sure what to make of this. I expected Ba3 immediately, but this is a fair idea. I considered allowing him to continue with a5, but I prefer playing without giving the opponent any counterplay if possible.} a5 {Alternatives: 10....d6; 11. a5 Nd7; 12. axb6 axb6; 13. Rxa8 Qxa8; 14. Bb2 and white is poised to take control of the a-file (even if he can't do much with it) After the game, the move 10....c5 was suggested. dxc5 is horrible (tripled isolated pawns), but I believed it to be too committal - the knight is not going to develop on c6, and c5 (for white) won't be a possibility. It was best, I thought, to keep the pawn chain flexible.} 11. Rb1 {Trying to make something of the pin on the b-pawn, but this is easily parried.} d6 12. Ba3 {What else?} Nd7 {Preventing c5 - it would lose a pawn.} 13. Rfc1 {Rather optimistic play from white. The rook does nothing here, and since no breakthrough on the queenside is forthcoming, the battleground will soon switch to the kingside, when most of white's army will be offside. At this point, or perhaps earlier, I felt white had to take action in the centre, by Nd2 and f3. He feared the influence of my bishop, but at least it would activate some of his pieces. The way chosen means that white is simply going to be suffocated.} Rf6 {Here we go!} 14. Qa2 {Trying to aim at the weak e6 pawn - but a weakness is only a weakness if it can be attacked.} Rg6 {In hindsight, an error I think. The pin on the g-pawn is easily broken, and meanwhile, the rook impedes the advance of the kingside pawns.} 15. d5 {On the upside, the pressure building up forces this desirable move for black. The threat was to win a pawn by Nxc3, followed by Bxf3. The text prevents this, but further closes up the position to the benefit of black's knights.} e5 {Of course - further blocking things up, and depriving the appetising d4 square for the knight. Though by this point, both of us had anticipated the next few moves - I felt that giving up an exchange (or a pawn) would be irrelevant, given the negligible ability of some of white's pieces to defend the king.} 16. Qc2 Ndf6 {16....Ndc5 allows white to win a pawn, for no compensation. "Clever" solutions are also no better: 16....Nxc3; 17.Qxc3 e4; 18. Bxe4 fxe4; 19. Nd4  and that knight is going to cause a lot of trouble, especially with the ds bishop coming to life, with an active post on b2 available. The same line applies with Nxf2 - Qxf2 e4; Bxe4 fxe4; Nd4 and white is is control of the open f-file.} 17. Nh4 Rg5 {Hoping to gain some compensation. The only thing I was worried about was the f5 pawn falling to the ls bishop - the light squared weaknesses in black's camp would then be horribly apparent. } 18. Nxf5 {Naturally} Bc8 {An interesting idea (I thought!) - the point is Bxe4; Nxe4; Qxe4; Bxf5 skewers the queen. Other possibilities:18....Rxf5; 19. Bxe4 Nxe4; 20.Qxe4 Qf6 puts pressure on f2, but black remains a pawn down, though the doubled c-pawns render that inconsequential, and the opposite coloured bishops ought to herald a draw.} 19. f3 Nxc3 {Nh6+ doesn't work after this for white - it's a piece down the drain, and the opening of the kingside files will actually favour black!} 20. Qxc3 Bxf5 21. Bxf5 Rxf5 {I would assess this as round about equal, but with a very slight edge for black due to effectiveness of his knight in comparison to the bishop, which is hemmed in by the pawns.} 22. e4 {A mistake - further closing the position, and chasing the rook to a better square.} Rg5 23. Rc2 {With the plan of Bc1} Rg6 {Removing the rook from the bishop's line, and paving the way for the queen to get to h4.} 24. g3 {Oh dear - that f3 pawn is going to suffer.} Nh5 25. Rg2 {Breaking the pin, but I think that getting the king out of there may have been a better option.} Qd7 {Threatening Qxa4, as well as allowing her Majesty to join in the fun by going to h3.} 26. Qc2 Rf8 27. Rf1 {At this point, both of us were in severe time pressure. So I rack up the pressure, though some of these moves are not especially useful.} Rgf6 28. Qb3 Qf7 29. Rgf2 Qg6 {With a cheap trap.} 30. Rg2 {Thank-you very much.} Qxe4 {The queen is immune of course due to mate on f1. I could have used this theme earlier with 28. Qg4! but I hadn't noticed it then!} 31. g4 {White desperately tries to mix things up, and to my eternal shame, I missed the following winning sequence: Rxf3! Instead, I threw away the win with} Qd4+ 32. Kh1 Nf4 {Forgetting that after...} 33. Rd1 {...My queen is trapped. At this point, white proposed a draw, with us both in chronic time trouble. I analysed a little way, involving Nd3 and giving up a knight for a few pawns, and a chance to restrict the bishop's activity. But with nothing doing, and white holding the advantage here (quite possibly winning), I accepted.  I was a little disappointed admittedly, but I was happy with the way I played, especially in the early middlegame, where my positional strengths were used - the ds bishop for white moved once in the entire game, and did absolutely nothing. True, the winning move was a cheap tactic (after having allowed white back into the game) but I felt that I had earned the half-point.}
