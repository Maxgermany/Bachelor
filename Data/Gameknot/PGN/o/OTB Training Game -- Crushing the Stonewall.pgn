1. Nf3 {Here is an interesting training game I played with a friend of mine OTB.  This is the correct way of playing against the Stonewall Dutch when Black chooses a setup with ...Bd6.} f5 2. c4 Nf6 3. g3 e6 4. Bg2 d5 {4...Be7; 5. 0-0 d5; 6. Nc3 0-0 7. d3 d4!; 8. Nb5 Nc6 gives Black the initiative and is a more accurate move order than the game continuation.  Therefore, White is advised to enter the main lines after 7. d4.} 5. O-O Bd6 {The bishop will become a target on this square and it will be easier for White to open the position for his better coordinated and developed forces.} 6. d3 {Preparing e4.} O-O 7. Nc3 c6 8. e4 {After this move, White has a lasting pull.} Nbd7 {This move is dubious.  But even after the correct, 8...de; 9. de e5; 10. Qb3!, White has initiative, as the light-squared bishop will be difficult to develop and White's development is quick and focused on the c-file.} 9. cxd5 {Now some forced play will clarify the situation in White's favor.} cxd5 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 exd5 12. Qb3 {White immediately takes advantage of the light-squared weakness.  Now 12...Nf6 can be met with either 13. Re1 or Bg5, with an advantage for White.} Nb6 13. a4 {Black has to play 13...Be7 and give up the d-pawn.} a5 {This loses material.} 14. Bg5 {Now 14...Qc7; 15. Rac1, and the queen is deflected from it's defense of the Knight.  Also, after 14...Be7; 15. Bxe7 Qxe7 the same is true of the defense of b6.} Rf6 {The best move under the circumstances.} 15. Bxf6 {The pin isn't going anywhere, but the immediate capture prevents Black from playing a move like ...Be5, when the bishop will recapture on f6 keeping the kingside pawn structure intact.} gxf6 16. Nd4 {Double hitting d5 and preparing to route the knight to b5, where it will assist with the White plan of invading on the c-file.} Be5 17. Nb5 Be6 {17...f4 is better.  Now the light-squared bishop will be entombed.} 18. f4 {The light-squared bishop will never see the light of day.  Restraining this piece was a key part of my strategy in this game, along with pressuring the isolated pawn and eventually infiltrating on the c-file.} Bd6 19. Qc3 {Eyeing the c7-square.  After 19...Rc8; 20. Qxa5 drops another pawn for no compensation.} Bb4 {Ignoring the queen infiltration, however, we both missed 19...Nxa4; 20. Rxa4 Qb6 ; 21. d4 Qxb5, which is still not sufficient to make up the material deficit, especially after 22. Rfa1.  White is clearly better .} 20. Qc7 Rc8 21. Qxb7 {Exchanging queens is fine also, but this is stronger as the White rooks can come to the c-file and create mating threats along the 7th rank.} Rc2 {It's tough to suggest a move here, but this is losing.} 22. Rfc1 Bc8 23. Qa7 Bc5+ {This is insufficient due to...} 24. d4 {Now, 24...Rxc1 ; 25. Rxc1 Bb4, admitting the mistake is still losing, but its better than the game continuation.} Nxa4 {??} 25. dxc5 Rxc1+ 26. Rxc1 Qe8 27. Bxd5+ Kh8 28. Qf7 {Forcing a trade of queens.} Qe3+ {Now Black is mated.} 29. Kg2 {Black resigns here as 29...Qe2 is met with 30. Kh1 and White has no more checks, unless he plays 30...Qf3 .}
