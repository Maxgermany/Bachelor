1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 cxd4 {As an amatuer, I cash in this pawn in this ("my") version of the Sicilian. } 4. Nxd4 Bg7 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bc4 e6 7. Be3 Ne7 {Pretty standard fare for the Sicilian, until I pull off this N in front of the K.  I prefer the support for the opposite side N.  } 8. Qd2 O-O 9. O-O Nbc6 10. Rad1 {White is mounting pressure in the center. } b5 {An attempt to chase off some of the pressure. } 11. Be2 d5 {This P move is needed, otherwise Black is very cramped. } 12. a3 Bb7 13. exd5 exd5 {But now Black has an isolated P. } 14. Bf3 {And White goes after it. } Rc8 15. Nxc6 Bxc6 16. Bd4 f6 17. Rfe1 Nf5 {Cannot recall why I did this; White is targeting the iso-P in the center and I pull off a defender.  } 18. Bc5 {That P is a goner. } Re8 19. Rxe8+ Qxe8 20. Nxd5 {There goes the P. } Kh8 {If White bumps the N off it's perch, there was a nasty fork at e7, gaining a R/N exchange. At this point, White is up a pawn and has good centered pieces.  It is White's to lose. } 21. Re1 {White takes a support away from the centered N, and... } Qd7 {Contributes to the N being attacked again.  } 22. Qd3 Nh4 {This is a ploy by Black to remove another support from the centered N and perhaps win a piece. } 23. Re7 {This White attack looks good, but.... } Nxf3+ {"White got tempi"!  This pulls the support of the center N and dodges the attack by White and gains a piece for Black. } 24. gxf3 Qxd5 25. Qe3 h6 {Black has the piece advantage... now can I convert? } 26. Kg2 Qg5+ {White missed this "sticky" check (forced contact with Q's) a move earlier, however I still got a chance to play this check. } 27. Qxg5 fxg5 {Q's are off the board...} 28. b4 Bf8 29. Re6 Bxc5 30. bxc5 {... the B's are off the board.  Can White convert the B advantage? } Kg7 31. Kg3 Kf7 {Tightening the middle. } 32. Rd6 Rc7 33. f4 gxf4+ 34. Kxf4 a5 {To get out of the sights of the White R. } 35. Ke5 Re7+ 36. Kd4 {Well, this helps Black,... gets to pull the R's off the board. } Rd7 37. Rxd7+ Bxd7 38. Kd5 {White has an passed P, the 4 isolated P are not a lot of help. } b4 39. axb4 axb4 {Stand by to send the Black B in orbit. } 40. Kd6 Ba4 {Bishop to the west side attacking a White P and threatening to clear path for Black P. } 41. c6 {White's race to the end line. } Bxc2 {Bishop to the south side, now the coast is clear of the Black P.  The B has an easy ride home. } 42. Kd7 Bf5+ {Bishop to the east side; a check and stopping a P promotion.  } 43. Kd6 b3 {The Black P can cruise to the end line; White resigns. }
