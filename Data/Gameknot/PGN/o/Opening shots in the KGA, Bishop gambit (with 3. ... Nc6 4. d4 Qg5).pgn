1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 {King's Gambit accepted} 3. Bc4 {Bishop's gambit. } Nc6 4. d4 Qg5 {Interesting. Never saw this move before this game. I think the game database had good stats on this move but I think the game shows it does not quite work for black. } 5. Nf3 Qxg2 6. Rg1 Qh3 {Already black's lost too many tempo's for the extra pawn. Neglecting development is always very dangerous in the king's gambit and perhaps more so in the Bishop lines.} 7. Bxf7+ {My opponent missed that the bishop can not be taken. Still after e.g. 7. Kd8 Bxf4 white has a huge lead in development, an enemy king trapped in the centre, a advanced queen to harass and will most likely win.  } Kxf7 8. Ng5+ Ke8 9. Nxh3 {}
