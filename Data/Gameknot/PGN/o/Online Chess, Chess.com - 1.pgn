Nxe5 {(-0.16) INACCURACY - Perhaps better was 10. d4 Alternative variation: [BEST MOVE (+0.57)] 10. d4 Bb6 11. dxe5 Ne4 12. Nbd2 Bf5 13.

Nxd6 Qxd6 19. axb3  $10 Alternative variation: [INACCURACY (-0.14)] 14. Nd2 h6 15. Be3 Re8 16. Rfe1 Ng4 17. Nf3 Nxe3 18. Qxe3  $10  Development should be the top concern computer!} c6 {(+0.22) defense move.} 15. Rfe1 {(+0.22) taking control of the open file.} Re8 {(+0.00) } 16. d4 {(-0.11) I wanted by bishop to be on c2 where it could do play a more important role on a kingside attack.} h6 {(-0.18) } 17. Bh4 {(-0.02) Be3 is the alternative but it blocks the e-file.} Be7 {(+0.46) } 18. Bc2 {(+0.51) Being consistent, with Qd3 to come.} Rc8 {(+0.78) Reinforce a week pawn.} 19. Qd3 {(+1.18) The computer now sees my plan and it likes it, awarding me a 1 point advantage} c5 {(+1.36) searching for some counter-play on the center, now seeing a kingside attack is coming.} 20. Bxf6 {(+2.03) getting rid of the knight is essential, this grants white the h7 square.} Bxf6 {(+1.74) } 21. dxc5 {(+1.66) of course take the pawn first then check.} Rxc5 {(+1.56) } 22. Qh7+ {(+1.55) } Kf8 {(+1.55) Suddenly now white has a decisive advantage. The rook on e1 plays a significant role in this even though the e-file is blocked by Be6.} 23.

Ne5 d4 27. cxd4 Qxd4  $16  I don't really agree here, i don't see how attacking the queen side with a4 would have improved my position, i wanted to double rook on e-file, keep the pressure. However i must humbly admit that my understanding of chess is limited and the computer is stronger than me.} d4 {(+1.54) ??} 25. Rd1 {(+1.41) pins, Paul Morphy's favourite weapon. Now the poor pawn is pined.} Rh5 {(+1.82) Seeking for counter plays.} 26. cxd4 {(+1.35) INACCURACY - Perhaps better was 26. h3 Alternative variation: [BEST MOVE (+1.77)] 26. h3 Qd5 27.

Qxg6  $16  yeah yeah whatever. h3 is defensive and it doesn't fit my style. The computer and I are having a little disagreement.} Ke7 {(+2.84) MISTAKE - Your opponent made a mistake! Better was 26... g6 Alternative variation: [BEST MOVE (+1.59)] 26... g6 27. Rde1 Re7 28. Bb3 Bxd4 29. h4 a5 30. Bxe6 Rxe6 31. Rxe6 fxe6 32. Qxg6  $18 Alternative variation: [MISTAKE (+2.84)] 26... Ke7 27. Bb3 Kd8 28. Qe4 Rf5 29. Rc1 Rxf3 30. gxf3 Bxd4  $18  g6 traps the queen in the corner, however that could be solved by trading of the bishop on e6. Now white is almost 3 points up!} 27. Bb3 {(+2.50) Pins his bishop.} Kd8 {(+2.35) unpins himself} 28. Qe4 {(+2.35) pins him again!} Qd7 {(+2.41) desperately tries to unpin} 29. Rde1 {(+2.48) No mercy. } Re7 {(+2.58) This unpins himself} 30. Qa8+ {(+2.40) Enough pins, time to go for the material advantage.} Qc8 {(+2.40) Only move. Kc7 brings lots of troubles.} 31. Qxc8+ {(+2.63) WHITE WINS - Play might have continued... Alternative variation: [CONTINUATION (+2.63)] 31. Qxc8+ Bxc8 32. Rxe7 Bxe7 33. Bxf7 Rf5 34. Ne5 Bh4 35. Re2  $18  Black resigned here, because if Kxc8 then d5! , black loses a piece.  Therefore 31.... Bxc8 is the only move and is followed by: 32. Rxe7 Bxe7 33. Bxf7 Rf5 34. Ne5 Bh4 35. Re2, this is really winning for me, he told me that the position is hopeless.  }
