[Opening "King's knight opening (C40)"]

1. e4 {So, as usual, I kick things off with the King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {And, he always responds with the Kings Pawn Game.  Believe it or not, this is unusual with this opponent, but it's not going to become a Ruy Lopez.} 2. Nf3 {It is, however, a King's Knight Game.} Bc5 {I understand what he is trying to do.  This is a developing move, but there is more to this then meets the eye.  My opponent was trying to intimidate me.  How do I know?  Well, he said, "I would mark this move with a question mark".  That's because he is trying to threaten SM.  However, his plan is not going to work as I will not be pressured.  So, I responded by telling him that a Scholars Mate is not feasible, in this position, due to my f3 Knight.  And, he looked at me and was surprised because his jaw dropped.} 3. Nc3 {In the meantime, I just continue with development.  Afterall, his last move was good but for the wrong reason.  Of course, it wasn't develops, but his intentions were off balance.  } d6 {In this position, he is planning to develop his LSB.} 4. d3 {At the same time, however, I am preparing to develop my DSB.} Bb4 {So, he decides to pin my c3 N.} 5. Bd2 {But, I just get out of it.  Not really much to talk about, as I have coped with this many times in other games.  As usual, this move is going to lead to an exchange.} Bxc3 6. Bxc3 Bg4 {So, he decides to pin my other N.  But, like before, I just as use to this.} 7. Be2 {Therefore, I just break it with this move.} Nc6 {! Of course, he also could have exchanged, but this move is better because he is now continuing to develop.} 8. O-O {Since I am slightly ahead in development, I decide to take advantage by castling, while the opportunity existed.  Like before, however, an exchange is just about to follow.} Bxf3 9. Bxf3 Nd4 {So, black is hoping for another exchange which he is about to get.} 10. Bxd4 exd4 11. Bg4 {At this point, I am trying to figure out a way to get my Q out, so that I can connect my rooks.} g6 {!? I don't know why he moved here, but it's his first inaccuracy.  And, it's quite risky.  First, it's a non developing move since it's not a central pawn or minor piece.  Second, for that reason, it's not going to help him control the center.  Most importantly, it will make it unsafe for him to castle Kingside. } 12. Qf3 {! Therefore, I take advantage by finally getting my Q out safely.  And, now, my rooks are connected, at last.  The only reason why I still care about connected rooks is because Jack showed me how two rooks can be very dangerous, when combined.} Qf6 {Normally, you should not bring the Q out, before all of your pieces are developed.  But, in one respect, this is an exception because he will continue developing, when we exchange.} 13. Qxf6 Nxf6 14. Bf3 {After he took, my LSB was attacked, so I had no choice but to retreat it.} O-O {?! This move is quite risky.  I understand that it's important to castle, and I almost always like to castle Kingside, as opposed to Queenside.  And, I am often stubborn about it, and have, on occasion, gone wrong by castling short, as opposed to, short.  But, even I realize that castling Queenside would have been much better because this move puts a whole around Ted's K.  In fact, best was 14...0-0-0, in this position.  The reason being is that more often then not, putting a whole around your K loses as it often leads to mate.} 15. Rae1 {In the meantime, I decide to bring my rooks together because of what I mentioned earlier.} Rfe8 {But, so does he.  However, better was 15...Rae8 because I learned from Jack Stockel that it is generally not a good idea to put your rooks on the same colors because it often leads to a bishop fork upon the rooks.  There are, however, exceptions, but this is not one of them.} 16. c3 {In the meantime, I decide to force an exchange by advancing my c pawn.} dxc3 17. bxc3 Re7 {?! I do not know why he made this move.  It does not accomplish anything.} 18. Reb1 {So, I decide to take advantage by attacking his b pawn.} Rb8 {He also could have defended with 18...b2, but this move is just as good.} 19. Rfe1 {I played this move in order to put pressure on the e-file.  I also could have played 19.Rbe1, but this is better.  Why?  Because I would have been stressed with the other move.  I feel that moving the b rook will eventually make my a pawn vulnerable, and that's a risk that I am not about to take.} b6 {I understand that he is trying to connect his pawns.} 20. a4 {But, I am not about to let my a pawn hang.  Of course, I could have played 20.Ra1, but then 20...Ra8.  So, I would still feel pressured for the same reason.  This prevents any, "Fight or Flight" that pawn will be attacked.  Afterall, as my coach used to always say, "Don't get nervous", and that has been one of my main weaknesses, until recently.  That's because I now think of certain moves way ahead so that I never get into a situation, where all I feel is anxious.  Here's the thing, in a different annotation cdeburca told me that I tend to exaggerate my understanding of positions.  In reality, however, I used to underestimate it.  It's amazing that I know a lot more information, then I thought.  So, all you have to do is feel confident, that's really the solution to a lot of problems.} Rbe8 {Of course, that is not going to stop him from bringing his Rooks.  BTW, this is what is meant, when I talk about two rooks being dangerous.  Although, I'm not nervous, I have to be careful because of the one time that Jack mated me, despite me winning his Q.  And, that was because he had a very similar position to this, where both of his rooks were connected.} 21. d4 {?! Therefore, I respond with this move, but better was actually 21.Rb5, allowing white to double the rooks, especially if then 22.Rb5, and 23.Rb1. In this case, I was just thinking about exchanging pawns, and what you have you.  So, what's the point of this move, then.  Now, my e pawn has less protection since I just advanced the d pawn.  Therefore, this move is pointless, and that's why I marked it as dubious.  } Nd7 {! He sees that I am eventually going to attack his N, so he retreats and in a very good spot.  At least, it's not in a different place where it would get or attacked or on the rim.  This proves that my opponent is also thinking ahead and not move by move.  } 22. a5 {! At this point, I decide to give away a pawn, or do I?  Well, as it turns out, this is not a free pawn but a gambit, as we will see later on.  And, it is not a true gambit.  As it turns out, I got this idea from something completely different, and that is QGA.  Because I am going to get a pawn back.} bxa5 23. Rb7 {That's because of this move.  } Nb6 {I don't know why he moved there.} 24. Rxa7 {But, that does not stop me from recapturing, as noted earlier.  Afterall, that's why 22.a5 was not a true gambit, and it also how I was able to apply the same concept that you would see in the QG.  The only exception is that the position is completely.  But, an important moral to learn is that sometimes you can apply the same concept, even in a different position.  Why?  Because concepts=ideas, and ideas are powerful tools as I learned in college.} Nc4 {I just figured out what he is trying to do.  In this position, he wants to exchange my LSB for his N, but that's not his main.  Why?  If I accept the exchange, my K will become exposed, but I am not going to allow that.  It just shows what I really know, so it proves that I am extremely intelligent. } 25. Be2 Re7xe4 {So, he captures my pawn, but that does not affect me in anyway.} 26. f3 {I had several different options.  At first, I thought that this was best, but I just took another at the board.  Only now do I realize that best was actually 26.Bd3 forking his N and e Rook.  At the very least, I would have won his R for my LSB.  What did I forget?  To look at the entire board.  Of course, this time, I had a very good reason for failing to do so.  As mentioned in the intro, I was not at my optimal best because I was still recovering from being jet lagged, and it had been a long while since my previous games.  For me, one week of not playing chess is long enough, and it would be the absolute threshold (just long enough) for me to start some of the important concepts.  So, it's a miracle that I was up to resuming my chess, on that particular day.  In this position, I was thinking to myself that I would kick his rook, so that it would be forced be move.  That way, I would be guaranteed to win back a pawn.  In this case, his a5 or c7 pawn.  That will happen, but that is when I am going to make a blunder, that will ultimately seal my fate, as we will shortly. } Nd2 {?? This was actually a blunder that should have lost the game, but I did not see it until it was too little and too late.  I simply thought, good now I can win what I had essentially lost.  However, I could have something worth a lot more which would have ended the game in victory.  What was it?  } 27. Rxc7 {?? In this position, my only goal was to get a pawn back.  However, I did not realize that I could have won his R, until now.  So, this is the losing blunder because this move loses a piece, when we exchange.  And, there will be no compensation for it.  Best was 27.fxe4!, winning his e R for my f pawn.  In fact, that would have been the winning move.  Therefore, it's ironic that what should have won actually loses.} Re4xe2 28. Rxe2 Rxe2 29. Ra7 {At this point, I am trying to get partial compensation, at the very least.  That's because I am attempting to win his a pawn, but I am not going to be successful, as noted earlier.} Re1+ {For one thing, he responds to my attack by placing me in check.} 30. Kf2 {Forced.} Ra1 {After I get out of it, he protects a5 with his R} 31. Ke2 {That, however, does not stop me from attacking my N.  Just because my opponent has a winning edge does not mean that I am immediately going to resign.  Although it's unusual, once in a while, you can pull a swindle and get an advantage of what should be with best play.  Of course, that is not going to happen in this game, but it's always worth a try.  } Ra2 {Instead of retreating, he protects with his R.} 32. Ra8+ {This time, I decide to place him in check because I am trying to make him feel stressed so that he makes a mistake that would allow me to get a swindle.  Unfortunately, that is not going, but there were one or two occasions where my position was dead.  But, I stressed my opponent enough to make a combat and pull a win.} Kg7 {Forced.} 33. Rd8 {But, this was the logic behind 32.Ra8+.  That's right, in this position, I am attacking his d pawn.  And, I actually thought that he had no way protect.  On the other hand, I was wrong and am, once again, not going to be successful in achieving my goal.  That's because I miscalculated something important.  He has a way to protect it, but that is the only thing that I don't like about thinking more then one step ahead.  It risks and sometimes causes miscalculation, and this is a good example.  However, thinking ahead is important in chess and in life, as I mentioned in a different annotation. } Nc4+ {So, he protects by placing me in a discovered check.  In addition, this move protects his d pawn, in addition, to his a pawn, in the short and long term.  At this point, I am almost completely hopeless, but I am not going resign, yet.  Remember: I always like to stay positive.} 34. Ke1 {So, I get out of it by moving my K back.  By doing so, I figured that I don't have to worry about any more, "King Checks".  However, I realize that he could continue to put me in check, at this point.  Although this will be his last time, it's only the beginning of my problems.  What he has in store is much worse, as we will see later on.} a4 {In this position, he is trying to get a passed pawn, but I am not going to allow that.} 35. Rc8 {So, I start by kicking his N.} d5 {! I actually thought that he would retreat, but this move is even better.} 36. Rd8 {Now, my attitude towards him is that if he can get a passed pawn, I will take a different pawn and work my way to where he is trying to accomplish his goal.  Normally, I would not have this attitude, but I have nothing else to lose.  In fact, I will eventually resign, so anything is better then nothing.  It just shows improvement in my games.} Ne3 {However, he finds a way to protect his pawn, but what I did was still worth a try.} 37. Rd7 {So, I just go for by putting pressure on the f file.  At first, I thought that I had successfully attacked or pinned his pawn, but he can just get out of it if he moves his K to g8 or f8.} Rxg2 {! But, this move is much better because he gets another free pawn.  At this point, I have no choice to give up, at least, two more pawns to avoid an unavoidable mate.  Therefore, I resigned, at this point. }
