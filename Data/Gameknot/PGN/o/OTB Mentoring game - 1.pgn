[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence, 4.O-O"]

1. e4 {I started off with my usual.} e5 {Although my coach has played the Sicilian, Karo Cann, and French Defenses, this is how he responds to my opening.  As I know, this is going to and does become the Ruy Lopez.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {I have seen Jack play 3...Bc5.  But, if he did that, I'd answer with 4.c3  Similar to what reversion mentioned in one of my annotations, GM Susan Polgar mentioned that it is a very common response.  As the idea is gaining tempo by attacking the B with that move, as the plan is 5.d4  So, it's what we call the c2-d4 plan since they're all aligned up.  But, Jack usually plays 3...a6, with which I respond with 4.Ba4.  But, he has also played the Berlin Wall, as Mr. Stockel did here.} 4. O-O {I used to answer with 4.Nc3  In fact, that was played in my game with tombulous since I thought he'd be too familiar with this move.  And, while there's nothing wrong with that move, reversion, said it's not quite as good as this move.  He said that, in general, it's best to stick with the mainlines.  While I agree with what Ken said which is that it's not the only thing to keep in mind.  I also agree with reversion's assessment because of what GM Susan Polgar outlined.  What she said is how I stopped trying different openings just because it's possible.  What Susan said is that what should be played is what you have the most experience with.  Although you have seen the other move, I feel the most comfortable with this move.  Of course 4...Nxe4 is a conditional move, as I'd quick play 5.Re1 } a6 {But, Jack now decides to play this.} 5. Ba4 {So, I retreated.  But, after the game, Jack implied that this is inaccurate.  Here is a shocker.  He said that better was to capture immediately with 5.Bxc6  And, the reason is that with stronger players it's better to exchange just because it's possible.  When I'm not sure, I go by what he says.  But, as ION has said, "Don't trust your opponent".  And, I know that he is wrong in this case.  In fact, that's why I fell into a bad habit of exchanging whenever possible since he said that with Tom Levine.  However, Ken mentioned in our first training game that one should not exchange just because it was possible to do so.  And, refusing the exchanges is what helped him to win the game.  Although problematic still with exchanges, it got better.  That was mainly when I asked Susan Polgar when it's appropriate to exchange.  But, what Jack outlined is wrong.  That's because deeper_insight (TA) mentioned that, in this position, it's better not to exchange.  Instead, after ...a6, the best response is Ba4, and after ...b5, Bb3 is played.  On the other hand, after ...Na5 the exchange is forced, but it's better to exchange at that phase then it is at this stage.  So, I really go wrong is a later on.} Be7 {The idea is developing and preparing to castle.} 6. Ng5 {But, since I'm now in unfamiliar territory and don't where to go, I decide to start becoming a little aggressive.  The idea is to stay calm and collected when that happens because of how intense openings can be.  When this happens, getting nervous is the worst you can do as then the Fight or Flight Syndrome takes over.  Instead, this is where I apply what I learn in Yoga and just adjust.  The way to do is come up with a variation.  In this case, while it sounds unsound, I'm trying to see if there's a chance of winning Jack's Rh8 or Q.  If now 6...b5, 7.Bb3 would become a problem for that reason.} O-O {But, Jack knows this and castles right away.  However, he would've played this, anyhow which is why he developed his DSB.} 7. d3 {So, I open up a line for my DSB.  I thought that this was better then fianchettoing it.  As I felt that it was more active here.  My plan is to somehow my N from g5, and instead, get the B there.  The idea is trying to put pressure against his Nf6.} b5 {But, Jack attacks it first.} 8. Bb3 Nd4 {And, he swarms in.  In most of the games that I've played, I just allow the opponent to exchange my Bb3 for the N.} 9. Bd5 {?? But, I wanted to try something different, as I wasn't ready to exchange.  Similar to what happened with Ken, I felt that there something that I could with my Bd5.  In this case, I felt that Jack was faced with a lot of pressure which in return made the position look difficult for me.  I felt that the only way for Jack to avoid losing a piece (R or B without compensation) was 9...f6  That was a conditional move with which I'd play 10.Bxf6+.  And, after 10...Rxf6 11.Bxf6+ Kxf6.  And, while everything seems even, given that I have a P and R for two minor pieces, I'd get an advantage.  As Jack's King would be exposed being that the weakest pawn is gone.  So, that's the only variation that came to mind.  In other words, it's the only that came into consideration.  But, as Ken and fiercequeen in one of her annotations, more needs to be considered.  In other words, I need to be thinking about more variations such as what happens next.  As that is what causes the oversights.  With that being said, this is where I really go wrong.   In fact, it is the losing blunder, as he is going to win a piece without compensation just like we saw in my second with Ken.  Much better was to leave the B on b3 and let him exchange.  As now, it's still even.  Not only that but, I might even benefit from that despite doubled pawns as it would be his N for my B.} Nxd5 10. Qh5 {Not knowing what else to do, I decided to threaten mate.  The idea isn't mate, but with this move, I thought that everything would work out.  His next move was conditional as that's what I thought he'd play.  Jack could also play 10...h6 to stop the threat, with which, I'd answer with 11.Nxf7 (to remove the weakest pawn).  And, after 11...Rxf7 12.Qxe5 winning back a piece.  In the end, Jack would only be a pawn up.  But, my belief is that despite that, I'd get an initiative since my K is safer.  That was the logic behind this move as I had that variation in mind.} Bxg5 {But, Ken asked me the same question in one of the training games that Bonnie asked me in her annotation which is when I said that a certain move gives white two attackers against one defender.  And, fiercequeen asked, what if black played the R up.  And, I realized that a second defender would be added.  So, my assessment was wrong.  The same thing happened here.  It was off, as I had overlooked this being played, instead.  With that, there's nothing that I can do with my N because it is now gone.  It only get worse.} 11. Bxg5 {?? Instead of asking myself what to do, I felt that I was safe here as it appeared to get material back.  What I forgot is that, first, I am still an entire piece down.  Second, this move gets me in another phase of trouble.  What I don't realize is that this move will cost me another piece.  Thus, it has now become a resignable position.  And, it was all caused by the oversights from just playing my moves, as opposed to, going through the variations.  But, I am not aware of what is to come.  It is afterwards that I figure out the consequences, in which I realize that it's too late to save the position.  Much better would've been 11.Nc3.  My idea was avoiding liquidation.  But, after 11...Bxc1, 12.Raxc1 or 12.Rfxc1, black was able to liquidate.  But, white hasn't lost any more material.  } f6 12. exd5 {Not wanting to lose a piece, I figured that taking here prevented any further damage.  But, I was wrong, as I had overlooked what happens next.  Retreating wouldn't have prevented the next move, and had I play 12.Nc3 to prevent what comes, 13.fxg5 does the same thing as I can't take due to his Qd8.  So, no matter what I had played here, he as going to win another piece.  It was due to my faulty choice to play 11.Bxg5} Nxc2 13. Nc3 {To prevent Jack from getting a R for free, I got the N out.  But, it's too little, too late.  He will get the equivalent to that.  } Nxa1 14. Rxa1 {The logic behind my previous comment was that I had considered retreating my Bg5 to prevent what happens next.  But, after 14...Nc2, Jack would've gotten a R and pawn without compensation.  But, getting the B afterwards, is the equivalent to that.  With that being said, although it is resignable, I'm not quite there yet.  But, I am almost ready to resign.  I figured that I'd play on a little more to see where I can go.  Not great for learning purposes.  However, it's similar to Hope Chess, so I'm hoping that Jack will make a mistake, somewhere, and allow me to draw.} fxg5 15. Ne4 {One reason for not resigning was my hope that Jack would blunder a pawn, and even allow me to renew a threat.} h6 {But, Jack prevents that.  And, now, it is only a matter of time before I resign.} 16. Qg6 d6 17. Rc1 Bb7 18. Nc3 Qf6 19. Qh5 Rac8 20. Ne4 Qf7 {And, it happened here.  In other words, this is where I resigned.  Similar to what happened in my second game with Ken, I am forced to liquidate Queens, in order to prevent Jack from winning my d5 pawn.  In the end, he said that I could have defended with 21.Nc3??.  But, that won't do, as he'd get my Queen, instead.  So, this is where I came to the realization that white's position is hopeless.  And, there's nothing else to get from continuing to play on.  When the game was over, Jack and I reviewed it.  He was almost enfuriated with my play here.  I can understand why, Mr. Stockel said that this was the one of the worst openings that he's ever seen from me.  So, we went to the beginning.  We even started a new game.  Unfortunately, he didn't go over it correctly since he said that it started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6  But, he played the Berlin Defense with 3...Nf6 followed by that moved.  And, he said that my losing blunder occurred right after he played ...Nd4.  Better was to just accept the exchange and get the DSB into play.  He was right there, as I miscalculated a variation and played a move that was easily countered, when I thought that I had pressure.  But, what my mentor said next, including the moral to this story is completely incorrect.  According to Jack, although not the losing blunder, I started going wrong by retreating with Ba4, instead of exchanging with Bxc6.   So, when we started a new game he made me play Bxc6 after ...a6.  Getting wrong on how this game went, we started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6.  But, we did not finish or get far with the game since Tom Levine came to play Jack.  With that comes his moral which is why I, for a long while, was in a bad habit of exchanging recklessly before the lesson with Ken.  As he said that the lesson to be learned is that when you're up against stronger opposition the idea is to exchange early and often.  By that, he means as much as possible, or doing so just because I can.  His logic is that stronger players want their pieces, so if you allow it, they become dangerous.  His moral, however, is wrong because of what Ken mentioned.  As the idea is that, in general, you might need those pieces later on.  So, just exchanging material without any thought is wrong on all levels.  And, as I know, Ken's correct.  With that being said, although I've reached the next level of seeing the board, what I must remember is to calculate the variations accurately.  That's what's needed to advance even further of good chess play.  What I forgot which Ken emphasized is that stronger players look at multiple variations, as opposed to, just one variation.  What I'm guilty of is only looking at one or two variations and thinking that they work which leads to oversights.  For example, I studied only one long set of variation when playing the blunderous 9.Bd5?? followed by 11.Bxg5?? which lost more material.  Although it didn't lose anything else, even 10.Qh5 was wrong because of how }
