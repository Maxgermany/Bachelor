[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 {So, I start off with the King's Pawn Opening.} d5 {And, this is how he responds.  Like the Master Mater (id=easy19 after coming, "back with a vengeance"), Tom decides to play the Scandinavian defense.  Now, I rarely come across this position, but I am used to it.  That's because I have played against the Scandinavian three times before, and this will be my fourth.  Not to mention that I saw a video about that before ever playing against it.} 2. Nc3 {? Now, I should have taken with 2.exd5, which is actually the main line to this variation.  But, I decided to try something different because tactical_abyss implied that I should try for different things, as opposed to, play something that people are too used to.  So, I figured that I was taking Tom out of his comfort, but that is just about to backfire.  Instead of exchanging, I decided to prevent him from taking with this move.  As we will see later on, this is a mistake that I will regret.} d4 {And, this is how.  While black doesn't take, instead he attacks my N.  I must find an outpost, and there are not a lot of options, despite how optimistic I try to be.} 3. Na4 {At first, I thought that this was the only option, and I certainly don't like it because my is on the rim, so as Jack will say later on, it is, "out of play".  As it turns out, I miscalculated, and now that I look, I have all of the options that I didn't think I had. Better was 3.Nb5 or 3.Nd5, forgetting that he cannot play 3.Qxd5.  Now, the reason for this miscalculation was because I was very slightly out of it and thought that his Q was on, say d7.  Now, that I look at it, I could and ought to have left my N on the homepage by moving to the b for d files.  } e5 {If I was living in the past, before I was this good, I would not know why black moved here.  But, from experience and a video by GM Susan Polgar, where she was actually teaching chess students, I figured out that this is a developing move.  And, this position, Tom is doing an excellent job in controlling the center since this move opens a line for his DSB.} 4. Nf3 {Recognizing one problem associated with 2.Nc3, I decide to do some, although not complete, correction with this move.  Now, although I am threatening to win a pawn, that's not my main intention.  But, that will happen later on.  My main intention, in this position, is to put pressure on the e file with this move, so that Tom feels pressured.   Sooner or later, we will see how this unfolds.  So, although not immediately, I accomplished my goal and then some.} b5 {? In the meantime, he decides to attack my N on the rim.} 5. Bxb5+ {But, that does not bother me because I take it with this check.  What white did not realize or might have forgotten is that his LSB is not on the d file.  So, I don't lose anything with this move.  Instead, I wind up with a pawn ahead.  And, despite losing, when the game is over Tom will mention to Jack and I that winning this pawn is just one of the many things that makes this game extremely good.} c6 {Not surprisingly, however, is the fact that he gets out of this by attacking my B.  This is the kind of thing that I expect from higher rated opponents.  I think, however, that this is where I got bad habits of attacking material for the thrill it.  That's because it's the kind of thing that I see GM's do, so although Jack likes when I study things that GM's analyze, it's important for me to be aware as a couple of coaches told me, that I should not try some of the really fancy stuff that Masters Grandmasters do immediately.  First, I should focus on becoming even stronger, and then I can start studying it.  It's just like when I had to figure out my main weakness and needed a lot of coaching, before I could start coaching and mentoring myself.} 6. Bc4 {So, this is where I retreat, eyeing f7.  And, no I am not attempting a mate in one, as you might think.  Instead, I am just trying to find a good outpost for my LSB.  That's because my only other move was 6.Bd3.  However, this move is best because retreating to the d file will later on force me to waste tempii, if I want to control the center.  Sooner or later, my plan is to advance my other center pawn and open up lines.  This will allow me to get another piece out, contest the center, and complete development so that when everything is developed, I can get my Q out.  Blocking the d file will prevent two of the things that I just outlined.} Bd6 {This move, however, is ok and does not contest the center because of where his d pawn is positioned.  That's because he was able to advance it two squares, as opposed to, one.  Having said that, this is why 2.Nc3? was a mistake.  Best was to simply follow the main line and exchange.} 7. O-O {In the meantime, however, I was still going to castle, one way or another.} Ba6 {I understand that Tom wanted to continue with development, which is why he moved his LSB.  However, I do not know why he wants to exchange, instead of play something like ...Bb7 or ...Be6.  In fact, if I were black, I would not dare to trade bishops because I am behind.  Now, with this move, I will take advantage of him by capturing.  Since I'm ahead, even exchanges will benefit my position, and I will not hesitate to take advantage of my opportunities.} 8. Bxa6 Nxa6 9. d3 {As mentioned earlier, my d pawn can only advance one square, since black already played ...d4.  } Ne7 {Meanwhile, black is going to continue with his development.} 10. Nh4 {While I was a little spacey, I think I went a little too far with this move.  I was kind of focused on a cheapo tactic, which I never should have been.  But, I was also focused on something which was more likely to and actually did occur.  Like usual, I got a little hyperfocused on winning his g pawn.  And, I kind of was not paying attention to the fact that he can do something, but there's more to this then meets the eye.  In other words, there was a little more to getting somewhat spacey and not paying complete attention, which I will explain towards the end, and it says a lot about this title.  But, on the other hand, I kept in mind that if I couldn't win a pawn, I would be able to exchange his DSB for my N.  The reason being is that I'm still ahead, so even if he were to defend, I would have absolutely nothing to lose with this move.  In fact, it would give me another advantage. } Ng6 {?! So, he responds by attacking my N that's on the rim.} 11. Nf5 {But, I am not bothered by that.  Instead, I feel like he just wasted time because I decide to attack his g pawn.  But, as thereaper1 asked me in a couple of previous annotations, did you think that your opponent would allow you to take.  At the time, I would have said no, but I assumed that black has messed up in some way and, henceforth, had no way around, which would mean that the threat would not be so easy to spot.  However, I missed just one thing that my opponent could do about this.  Normally, I don't make moves like this, but believe it or not, in OTB this kind of thing used to be a little more common the internet chess.  But, as noted earlier, I am not completely with it.  So, although I'm not sleepy, I kind of have to, "wake up and smell the coffee", as they say.} O-O {Unlike in a previous game, while my opponent cannot attack my N, in this position, my move was somewhat pointless as he now protects by castling.  Still, this reaction means that there's not as much to get upset about with my last move.  Having your opponent defend by castling does not put you at a real disadvantage, if you're already castled.  When, he counter attacks, then it's a different story, and you've got problems.  However, this time, black will have something else to think about, now that he has kept his g7 pawn.  I will exchange his DSB for my f5 N.  Not only am I ahead, but I'm getting rid of his strong bishop.  And, with that in mind, I am beginning to get more and more confident as time goes on.  But, of course, I am not going to underestimate him.} 12. Nxd6 Qxd6 13. Bd2 {Now, that all is said and done, I take advantage of the opportunity to get my last minor piece out.  Of course, black now has a slight lead in development, given that he is completed developed.  But, once my Q out, then we'll be equal again.  } Nc7 {In this position, Tom moved here to take his N back on the homepage.} 14. c3 {?! At this point, Tom takes a mini break, and my coach said, "Your Knight is misplaced.  Be, careful, it is in danger."  This is the first time where I have mixed feelings about it.  In other words, I agree but also disagree with Jack, at the same time.  It's not in immediate, but should he ever enable himself to play ...Qa6 it will be.  First, I looked to see if anything was in immediate danger before fussing over the N.  When I determined that it wasn't, then I would come up with a plan to defend my piece.  Normally, I don't make a big deal about stuff like this, but as we all know, it's important to think steps ahead, and not just move by move.  This is a perfect example.  Before, I realized that there were other places for my N, I told my coach that I had to place my N on the rim to defend it, and that there was no way around it.  Now, that I think about it, however, there were other options that I did not see.  Of course, when I played Na4, I actually felt like I was in a different time zone, but only at that moment.  And, that's pretty bizarre because I did not feel this way in my game against Jack.  But, it was as though I flew from the West Coast right to the East coast.  And, there is a 3 hour time difference from opposite coasts.  So, even though the game started at like 11:00 am, it temporarly felt like 8:00 a.m., in my body.  Now, that I'm in a later phase I'm beginning to get back to normal and am starting to feel like my normal self again.  However, things will not be completely normal, until the end.  Mr. Stockel, said that I had a very good move that I could make which would protect my N.  But, he wasn't going to tell me the move since I was in a middle of a game against Tom.  Although, it's OTB and not rated, having a different person tell you the right move, even your coach, is like cheating.  Of course, I found the move, and this is it.  Because I am counting and relying on an exchange. After which, his d pawn will not hang in this spot, and so my N will be perfectly safe on the c file.  Of course, that is exchange is not going to happen, so this move is not going to help.  So, I will have to come up with a different plan.  } c5 {After this move, I don't exchange, because after Tom retakes he'll still have a pawn on d4 which will prevent me from bringing my N on c3.  In fact, even if he hadn't played ...c5 that would have happened which is why 14.c3?! was pointless.} 15. c4 {So, I, instead decide to play this.  Why?  Because in these types of positions, I have see games where strong players advance their pawns one square, like this, as opposed to, making a capture.  And, this kind of thing has given them an advantage.} Ne6 {This time, I don't know why black played this.} 16. b3 {But, at least, I finally found the right move to bring my N safely back on the homepage.  I will, however, wait until later because this move accomplishes something else which is that my N is now protected.  And, that was also one of my goals, since Jack told me that my Knight was in danger.} Ngf4 {In this position, black attempts to win back a pawn.  But, I am not going to allow him to take on d3.} 17. Qf3 {And, because of that I am also now completely developed.  So, I just gained back an advantage that I didn't have.  In addition, this is one reason why I decided to hold off on putting my N back to the homepage.  Since it's not in danger or anything else like that, perhaps the only principle which I generally ignore is that a N on the rim is grim.  Although some GM's like Susan Polgar tell you that developing in the wrong spot can be worse then not developing.  And, she does take her N off the homepage, as an example, I don't see where it makes much of a difference, unless my piece is in immediate danger.  However, if I were still a beginner, then it absolutely would matter, as I would try to just stick with all the basics.  Over time, you learn that one does not have to make a big deal about everything regarding General Openings.  Otherwise, that's the equivalent to hyperfocusing.} Rac8 {This is where I start forgetting which rook was moved.  But, this move makes a lot more sense to me.  So, he brings his rook over, which you generally see, after being completely developed.  This, however, makes much more sense Rfc8.  The reason being is that when both your Rooks are connected like this, it's not a good idea to bring your rook on the same color as the other rook, as I have learned from Mr. Stockel.} 18. Rae1 {Having said all of that, I also bring rook my over, but on a different color, as well.} Ng5 {?! So, black decides to attack my Q.  I don't know why because I feel that it doesn't accomplish anything} 19. Qg4 {Therefore, like my game against Jack, I decide to counterattack, in order to punish black for his attack.} Qf6 {I thought that my last move was enough to intimidate black, so that he would retreat.  However, I missed something important.  As it turns, out Tom can and does defend his N with this move, instead so that he has nothing to worry about.  However, since I'm still ahead, this move does not stop me from exchanging his N for my B.  The only problem, that I didn't realize, is that the exchange involves my dominant.  Now, at the time, I had trouble determining a strong from a weak bishop.  But, as it turns out, this was my dominant bishop.} 20. Bxf4 Qxf4 {Not surprisingly, he takes back with the Q, as opposed to his e pawn.  And, this is a better move.  However, I will force another exchange, as opposed to retreating my Q.} 21. Qxf4 exf4 22. Nb2 {Since all is said and done, now I bring my N back to its homepage, since I'm ready to do so.  This implies, that there was absolutely no rush because what I outlined earlier. } Ne6 {In this position, I think that Tom is a little too worried about his a pawn.  I mean, he will protect soon, but it's not in danger.  But, I understand that he thinks it will be in danger in several moves, but why?  Although, I am ahead, I'm not threatening to take it anytime soon.} 23. f3 {So, I decide to advance another pawn.  Now, that we're near an endgame, there's no danger in putting a whole around the K because pretty soon my King will become a powerful weapon.} Nc7 {?! He protects, afterall, but as noted a move earlier, it's not anywhere in danger.  So, that's why I view and marked this move as pointless.  It's simply because I don't believe that this is pointless and does not accomplish anything.} 24. a3 {?? At this point, I am trying to figure out a way to get a passed pawn.  But, after the game, Tom told me that he thinks this move is the losing blunder and my decisive mistake which is why I marked with two question marks.  One reason is that he will now win back a pawn, after ...Rb8.  Now, of course, I'm not crazy about 24.a4, in this position due to tactical reasons.  But, what I found out was that a4, actually would have been a lot worse then I thought.  In fact, that move would  have lost very quickly.  This, move, however, does not seal my fate as quickly, but luck will run out when we reach the endgame.  That's because of what he's going to do in the next few moves.  Pretty soon, his N will swarm in on the a file, and it will lead to a loss of material.  Therefore, I will wind up behind, as opposed to, ahead, believe it or not.} a5 {! At this point, black decides to advance.  At first, did not know what it this would accomplish because I didn't think that it could promote.  But, I will find out otherwise, later on.   } 25. a4 {At this point, I am just trying to stop him from getting a passed pawn.  But, come to think of it, it's too little too late because that, by definition, is a passed pawn, as we will see shortly.} Rcb8 {! This move automatically wins back a pawn, as noted earlier.} 26. Nd1 {Without any way to defend b3, I decide to move my N, knowing that it will be in danger, right after he takes.  } Rxb3 27. Nf2 {But, I want to keep it on a square where development is complete.  In other words, had it been left on d2, that would undo some of my development, which I don't want.} Rfb8 {This is a very common and dangerous move.  At this point, black decided to double his Rooks like this.  We usually see strong players do that, and in the past, Jack Stockel taught me that this is generally a good idea to do this because doubled rooks can pose as immediate threats.  For example, a long time ago, Jack Stockel defeated, despite the fact that I was a Q ahead, he managed to deliver mate with doubled rooks, similar to this.} 28. g3 {Since material is even, I still see no harm in trying to force an exchange.} Ne6 {?! At first, I wasn't sure why he played this, but a second look shows he actually wants to win a free pawn.  And, it appears that once he plays ...Ng5, that will be feasible.  But, I am not going to allow, so this move was pointless.  Instead, I am going to exchange in order to avoid losing material.} 29. gxf4 Nxf4 30. Red1 {Recognizing that my d pawn is in danger, this is the very move that protects it.  In other words, any other move loses my P.} f6 {Since this is an endgame, it's now appropriate to activate the King.  That's because in an endgame, the K becomes a powerful, the equivalent to, at least, a piece from what I've heard.} 31. Rd2 {I miscalculated.  In this position, I thought that my d pawn was in danger.  That's because I thought that I sensed a fork after, 31...Ne2+, but as it turns out, that check would not be anything to worry about.} Rb8b4 {At this point, however, black makes a go for it.  Now, I don't if Tom played this or R3b4, but I think that he moved his rook on the eighth because I seem to recall the R's being bundled up like this (right on top of one another).  Either way, however, it doesn't matter because the result is still the same and in the exact same way.  My a R is now attacked, so there is something to think about, this time.} 32. Ra1 {Therefore, I have to protect a4.} Rb3b1+ {So, he decides to place me in check, at all.  But, this time, I realize that it's not serious, so I am bothered by it, as I will force an exchange.} 33. Rxb1 Rxb1+ {And, I also don't mind being check any more now, then I did earlier.  } 34. Nd1 {I also could have gotten out of this with 24.Rd1 and exchanged with 24...Rxd1, 25.Nxd1.  But, for some reason I like this move better.  Either way, it does not prevent white from losing a pawn.  Therefore, I will actually end up a pawn behind because after the exchange, black would have been able to take ...Nxd3.  As Tom later told me when I talking about the losing move, either way, a pawn is gone, in this position.} Ra1 {The reason why I can't protect a4 is that I cannot play 35.Nb2 because my N is directly pinned to the K.  In addition, I cannot defend with 35.Ra2??, or I'll lose material worth much more, in this position.} 35. Kf2 {Without any way to defend my pawn, I decide to activate my K, in an attempt to use it as a weapon.  In addition, this gets rid of my absolute pin.} Rxa4 36. Nb2 {Because of his last move, without much to lose, I decide to intimidate black, with this move.  And, I was thinking in terms of trying to pull a swindle, given that I'm now a pawn behind.  However, this plan is not going to work.} Rb4 {!! At first, I wasn't sure why he moved there and actually viewed this move as ?!.  That's because there's no point in trying to attack a piece, knowing that you can't win it.  However, this is way more this then meets the eye, and Tom wouldn't make a move just attack like this, unless he knew that it would win something.  Although black extremely well, this was, by far his best move.  As we will see later on, this move will threaten a pawn promotion and ultimately lead to my downfall.  And, that's why this move is extraordinarily brilliant.} 37. Kg3 {Knowing that he can't take, I moved here, but more then to simply attack his N.  It's because now, I'm starting to execute my plans of using my K as a weapon.} g5 {At the same time, however, black realizes that his N is attacked, so he takes action with this move.} 38. h4 {At this point, I want to force an exchange.  Normally, it's a bad idea to exchange when you're behind, so why do it at all?  Well, if 38...gxh4, I can make my K more powerful by retaking with 39.Kxh4, and that was the part of the same plan, that I had noted earlier.  However, black is not going to allow that.} h6 {Instead, he counteracts with this move, making 38.h4.} 39. Kg4 {However, I am still going to be bring my K out.  And, now I originally felt that I had an advantage due to the opposition.  But, that is not the case here.} Kf7 {Instead, black gets out of it by activating his K.} 40. Rh2 {Although there's not much to worry, aside from the fact that he's ahead, I decide to give my h4 pawn extra protection with this move.  While it was not in danger, a few months ago, Jack Stockel told me to count your number of pieces and pawns and compare them to the amount that your opponent has.  This is what he means by that.  For example, up until a move earlier, none of us would have lost anything, if he played something like ...gxh5.  That's because we both have a pawn to make the recapture.  But, now I have an extra piece to take back, so if he decided to play that, I would simply respond with Rxh4, and this would actually win two pawns, as opposed to one, so I would instead, be the same as I was before (a pawn ahead).} Kg6 {Of course, my opponent is not going to retake.  Instead, he plays this to achieve the opposition, like I attempted to do before.} 41. Kg3 {With his last move, this is forced anything else would allow black to mate in one with ...h5#.} a4 {Like we saw earlier in the game, this is the same pawn that he is trying to promote with.  The only problem is that his R is there, making it very difficult to prevent his promotion.  That's because black is preventing me from taking his pawn, which is what made 36...Rb4!! extraordinarily brilliant.} 42. Nd1 {Because I now know how close he is to promoting, I try to prevent that with this move, as it does prevent him from playing ...a2.  However, this is only the beginning of white's problem, as we are about to find out.} Nxd3 {First, he wins another free pawn, putting me further behind.  And, things are about to take an ugly turn.} 43. Rd2 {After taking, I now decide to resort to extreme aggression, and the reason being is that I now realize that I'm losing.  So, now I decide to attack his N just for the thrill of it.  I won't do this kind of thing, unless I am well aware that I'm clearly losing, as in this case.  When you're in trouble like this, there is nothing to lose by becoming super aggressive.  As black-cat-hamelet commented in a previous annotation, "The only time playing badly would ever be of any use is if you are losing anyway and try a strategy you know can fail in the hope that your opponent falls for the trap."  This is a perfect example.  Who knows?  Not in this game, but sometimes getting this aggressive in a desperate situation can help you to pull a swindle, as I have done before.  For me, at least it shows that I'm not afraid or ready to resign.  It's pretty much contradictory of when I was a beginner and resigned prematurely.  Well, I learned from that , so I don't do it anymore.  But, this is one of the main that turned that weakness into a strength, believe it or not (the ability to pull swindles).  And, this is pretty much why Jack Stockel says, "Don't give up right away."} Nf4 {As expected, he retreats.  So, even if can't be aggression, I have to come up with a different, fi I have any hope of staying in the game.} 44. Ra2 {And this is the plan.  I figured that, at the very least, black would lose some of his winning advantage.  In one respect, I thought that I just outsmarted him and diffused the situation with this move, but that is not the case.  Sure, it prevents him from promoting, which is what he wanted.  But, he is now going to win another pawn, and there is no way around it.  I missed that, but even if I hadn't, I certainly would have moved here, anyway, due to extenuating circumstances that I just mentioned.  If I didn't he would certainly promote, and I didn't want to allow it.  However, this position is hopeless for white, no matter what I do and how much optimism I have.} Rxc4 45. Rb2 {At this point, I just lost all of my optimism.  Therefore, knowing the situation cannot get anyworse, I just make a random because there I have nothing better to do anyway.} Rc2 {I thought that this position was surely deadlost for white with no way around it because I looked at either having to retreat my N or allowing him to promote.  Therefore, I resigned.  A second look, however, shows that I actually could have pulled a swindle and wound up like 3 points ahead, after 46.Rxc2.  So, resignation was probably premature.  Now, the only problem is that we could not continue our game because Tom had to leave about 5 minutes afterwards.  So, you have to ask yourself why Tom played this then?  Maybe the game was really lost because it looked like my opponent had a plan and, therefore.  So, it's possible that there would be good reason for sacrificing a major piece, in this position, IDK.  But, what it all comes down to is the moral.  Are you ready?  After the game, Tom told me that it is generally not a good idea to record the game.  The reason being is that you spend at least 50% of your time writing down the game.  That's at least half the time that you spend on the actual.  Therefore, you wind up losing time and being forced to rush, which I have noticed.  Now, you really need that time to concentrate on your games.  After he told me that, I said that the reason I record is to make an annotation because as a couple of commentators mentioned and I noticed, there's pretty much no point in annotating a game, if you don't remember what was actually played.  Then, my opponent said, that the only time it's necessary to record a game, is if you're in a tourney.  And, the reason being is that part of the tournament rules state that if you're competing in a match, you have to record the positions.  In which case, then it's worth annotating, since you're obligated to write things down anyway.  And, he could also see me annotating computer games since the positions are right there, with nothing to write about or record.  But, that's no need in an informal game like this.  The only other time it might be worth annotating is, if one can just remember the positions and was played, without writing it down.  But, Tom advised me not to try and memorize it like that.  In addition, Jack recommended that I follow his advise because he's a strong player, and I absolutely agree with my coach.  And, that's because concentrating on the actual game is far more important then worrying about what's needed to make the annotation.  I also noticed something else that I didn't before.  Remember what I said in the beginning and early in the annotation, where for the first time in a very long while, I went for cheapo tactics and cheap shots and it felt like I was in a different time zone?  Well, as it turns out, writing the positions took away a lot of my energy away and really made me feel tired due to the length and difficulty of this game.  That's why although this was such a great game, I wasn't completely with the program and made some beginner mistakes.  It was almost as though I forgot the basics, when that didn't really happen.}
