1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 {English (A25), closed system} Nf6 4. Bg2 Bc5 5. d3 d6 {Here's where the match gets interesting very quickly.} 6. Bg5 {Here my opponent's intentions are obvious. Most likely he wanted to play Nd5 or Ne4 next turn to put immense pressure on my knight on f6. However, I catch him by surprise very quickly.} Bxf2+ {Here I intend on temporarily sacrificing my bishop to get a slight advantage in material.} 7. Kxf2 {Sac accepted.} Ng4+ {With this check, I'll get a bishop back and jump ahead in material by a pawn...or so I thought.} 8. Kf3 {A horrific blunder. 8.Kf3?? leaves the king in a vulnerable position in the center of the board. Moving back to either c1 or d1 would've been better. Being ahead in material would be nice, but a bigger prize is in sight.} Nd4+ {The first move in a mate in 3. White resigned here. Here are the possible continuations:  9. Ke5 f5+ 10. Kd5 c6++ (my conditional moves were set for this continuation) 9. Ke5 f5+ 10. Kd5 Be6++ 9. Ke5 Bf5+ 10. Kd5 c6++  I was very fortunate to get a golden opportunity this early in the game. The main lesson that I got out of this game is that it's almost never a good idea to bring your king out to the center of the board this early in the game. It's far too risky with this many pieces on the board.}
