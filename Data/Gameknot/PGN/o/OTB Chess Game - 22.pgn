[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 {This is my type of opening.} e5 2. Qg4 {This is where I bring my queen, and Jack Stockel has told me that it is ok to have an early queen exposure, in some cases.} Bc5 3. b3 {I am not aware that Pat is about to bring out his Queen.  Instead, I do not think about anything, so I played b3.  This is a bad choice that I will later regret.} Qf6 {Now he brings out his queen, and I am in some trouble.  Instead, of figuring a way out of trouble, I panic and make a move that will destroy, immediately loose, this game on the next move.} 4. Ba3 {I should have played Nf3, and this would have temporarily bailed me out of trouble.  Instead, I play Ba3, so I am now doomed on my next move.} Qxf2+ {Now, what do I do?} 5. Kd1 {There are no other choices but to play kd1 because it is the only move that is available.  The game ends on the next move. } Qxf1# {Now, the game is over, and this was my worst game ever.  This game involved OTB chess, and it took place before I knew Jack Stockel or this site.  It happened approximately 10-12 years.  It was between my first and fourth of playing.  At that point, I was still horrible at chess. }
