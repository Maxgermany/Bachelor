1. c4 {Hi everyone!  When you look at your position, do you think, after playing every move, that you have covered all bases.  Think again because yet again, Henry and I end up being conquered by a Master with a rating north of 2300.  This time it is against my buddy Dave Rundle.  How did this happen?  Well, the title gives you a clue!  You can also follow gameknot analysis as follows:-   http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16902271&rnd=0.048996459985547636        Back to the game - I start off with a rarity by my standards - 1. c4 which is the English Opening.} e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 {3. .... Nf6 - development.} 4. Nc3 c6 5. e3 a6 6. Qc2 {6. Qc2 - Glenda moves onto this square because she has the square h7 in her sights.  If Dave castles kingside there are thoughts of the possibility of Glenda hopping on her broomstick onto that very square if Dave is unaware!} c5 7. cxd5 exd5 {7. ..... exd5 - pawn trade.} 8. Be2 cxd4 9. exd4 {9. exd4 - another pawn trade.} Nc6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Rd1 {12. 0-0 - both sides castle kingside after this move.} O-O 12. O-O Be6 13. a3 {13. a3 - stopping Nb4.} h6 14. Be3 {14. Be3 - an OK move at this time but it will be the start of an unwanted overload set up.} Bd6 15. h3 Rc8 16. Qb1 {16. Qb1 - I decided to keep Glenda on the b1-h7 diagonal but I thought it wise to move her out of the line of the rook on c8.} Re8 17. Rfe1 Qd7 {17. ..... Qd7 - I think black is looking for a sac on h3.} 18. Bf1 Bf5 19. Bd3 {19. Bd3? - Dave pointed out that this was a bad mistake because it did allow a sac on h3.  I really did want to keep Glenda on that diagonal and I did not want Dave's lsb to get complete control of the b1-h7 diagonal.} Bxh3 20. g3 Bg4 21. Kg2 {21. Kg2 - I decided to move Henry to this square because I had a BxRP sac idea of my own.  I also had big ideas of piling up with my major pieces on the h file.  Unfortunately, Dave unleashes his own deadly plan.} Rcd8 22. Reh1 {22. Rh1 - carrying out the first stage of my plan but alas, this is how far I get.} Bxf3+ 23. Kxf3 {23. Kxf3 - Henry is drawn out into the open and into a check by the Wicked Witch of the West!} Qg4+ 24. Kg2 {24. Kg2 - only move.} Rxe3 {24. ..... Rxe3!! - this is the move which takes advantage of the overloaded piece.  This piece happens to be the pawn on f2 which is defending both Fou Lenoir and the pawn on g3.  I have to recapture but the pawn on g3 is hanging to deadly effect.} 25. fxe3 Qxg3+ 26. Kf1 Ng4 {26. ..... Ng4 - threatening Qf2#.} 27. Rd2 {27. Rd2?? - stops one mate but allows another.  Gameknot Analysis showed that if I had played Bh7+ then I would have stopped the mate but ended up 9 material points down - ruinous.  So, yet again, Old Matey descends on Henry .....} Nxe3+ 28. Ke2 Nxd4# {28. ..... Nxd4 MATE!! ...... with a cadaverous knight!}
