[Opening "Sicilian (B20), Gloria variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. c4 {I start off with the usual Sicilian Defense.  But, Mariann plays this, instead of, sticking to the mainlines with either 2.Nf3, or 2.Nc3.} d6 {But, I continue, as if, it's all normal.} 3. Nf3 {Now, she develops normally.} a6 {And, I treat like a later time in the Open Variation to prevent the possibility of her playing 4.Bb5+} 4. Nc3 {Continuing with her development.} Nc6 {And, I start developing.} 5. Nd5 {I don't know why she played this since it moves the same piece twice.  Normally, I care about all reason, which it should be.  But, since it we're low on time, it doesn't matter to me, this time around.  Actually, she implied that there was no reason for this by saying, "Just for fun" with this move.} e6 {But, I punish this by kicking the N and gaining tempo.} 6. Ne3 Nf6 {As I now develop another piece.} 7. g3 {? Fianchettoing her B.  But, this is a mistake as I'm going to win a pawn.  Best was 7.Bd3 to prevent that and develop another piece, at once.} Nxe4 8. d3 {Kicking my N.} Nf6 {Which I protect.} 9. Bh3 {Bringing her LSB into action.} Be7 {And, I continue with my development, in the meantime.} 10. g4 {Trying to kick my Nf6.} h6 {Which I stop.} 11. O-O {Castling, at once.} Qb6 {Not giving this any thought at all, I bring my Queen into play just because it looks like a good move, forgetting about good openings or not making a move because you can.  I say that because I'm also not that good at handling big time crunches like this.} 12. Kg2 {?! In my books, this is pointless because it's not an endgame so the K should not be brought in action, yet.  However, like me, Mary is also under a time crunch and must pack up a noon, as well.} O-O {So, I castle, at once.} 13. g5 {Attacking my N.  So, in doing so, I get to exchange pawns.} hxg5 14. Nxg5 Bd7 {Completing my development.} 15. b3 {Fianchettoing.  My guess, is beside completion of development, Mary wants to do it in a place where there's a good place for her Bishop.} Qa5 {So, I try to put Mary in a situation where she doesn't know what to do.  That's because of what's going to happen on my next move.} 16. Qf3 {But, Mary, however, thought she had an answer to that.  Except, that I can and will attack her Ra1.} Qc3 17. Ng4 {?? And, this is where Mary blunder.  She did have an exchanging pieces in mind, but now, I can win her Rook, before that and without compensate.  Much better would've been to complete her development, at once.} Qxa1 18. Nxf6+ Bxf6 19. Qh5 {Threatening mate on me which I'll defend against by liquidating.} Bxg5 20. Bxg5 Qe5 {Leaving her Bishop indirectly pinned to the Queen.  But, after this move, the time has run out for both of us, making it an unfinished game.  Mary, however, was busted from whichever you way you look at with that blunder.  After this game, though, Jack said that I didn't play well.  I'm not sure what line, but he said that there was a line that I could've pinned and won the Queen.  Considering, however, that time really was of the essence, I disagree with Jack.  As this is the best that I've ever played, for someone who was on a tight schedule, and thus, under a major time crunch.}
