1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {Hoping for the Winawer, which always gives an interesting game, though I usually lose :-(} Nf6 4. e5 {I've had very boring games after 4. B g5} Nfd7 5. f4 {Classic Nimzowitsch strategy: strengthen the strongpoint.} c5 {and the classic French tactic for undermining the strong centre} 6. Nce2 {preparing to strengthen the chain with P-c3} Nc6 7. c3 Be7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. Ng3 {I have to allow my WB out quickly so I can castle, so a third move with this N in a relatively blocked position may be forgiven, I think.} f6 {Typical French attack on the centre, before I have got my K to safety.  I start analysing some lines were everything on the f file disappears, except his R, and don't like them...} 10. Be2 {I considered this less risky than 10. Bd3, when the WB interferes with the Q's defence of d4, though at the moment I have enough defending d4 anyway.  One of the advantages of Nimzowitsch's theory of over-protection is that it provides mobility to each of the defenders: they can move without leaving their charge defenceless.  So, given the choice, I prefer not to interfere with the d pawn's defence.  Also, the Be2 protects the Nf3 in the event the f-pawns come off.} fxe5 11. dxe5 {Played more or less spur of moment but critical to the shape of the game.   I always like to unbalance the pawns.  Also, I have had painful experience in the French of losing the d pawn and the whole position collapsing as a result ( though in some lines such as the Milner-Barry Gambit in the Advance, White offers the d-pawn deliberately).  I spend most of the rest of this game considering moves and exchanges on d4 and their ramifications, eventually gaining half an hour on the clock and winning material as a result.} b6 {Mysterious at the time but the B on b7 exercises a baleful influence in many variations hereafter.} 12. O-O Bb7 13. Be3 g6 {Even more mysterious.  I think it's partly a waiting move, partly making way for a R to come to g7, partly discouraging W from playing f5 but it looks odd when Black doesn't have a B that can easily cover g7 or h6.} 14. Qd2 {To help complete my development by connecting rooks, support the B on e3 and not over-commit myself with speculative moves with my minor pieces.} Qc7 15. Rac1 {I always like to oppose the Q with the R but there were other more detailed considerations...} Rf7 16. Bd3 {Partly to provoke Black's next move, partly to create a hole for the Ng3 in the event it is attacked, partly to threaten f5.} c4 {creating a nice hole for my pieces on d4, from which to attack Black's position} 17. Be2 {After a long think, I decide defence of f3 is more important than attack along the b1-h7 diagonal.} Raf8 18. Nd4 Nxd4 {After long thinks on both our parts, this move was played instantaneously but Black was already 20 minutes behind on the clock.  } 19. Bxd4 {... and I played this a little too quickly too but it turns out fine.  What I don't like about the move is that it condemns the B to a pawn's role for much of the game, its main duty being to blockade the potential monster on d5 and prevent discovered attacks by Black's Bb7.  What I like about the move s that is puts the B on the long black diagonal, pointing at the squares around Black's K, if I can free my e pawn by getting rid of Black's e pawn.} Nc5 {I don't want to take this because Black's B will occupy c5 with check, allowing the d pawn to advance and Black's Bishops will dominate the game.} 20. Kh1 {So I play a waiting move.  I decided that, despite my worries about the long white diagonal, I had it locked up, so the K would be safer on h1 than on g1.} h5 {Threatening to attack my Ng3, which has nowhere to move!  So either I create a hole for it or lose some material.} 21. Bxh5 {!?  I rather liked this solution, giving up the otherwise fairly redundant bishop for his two pawns and allowing the N to defend f4 from h5, in an apparently threatening manner.  The question then arises whether I can exploit his exposed King position before he uses the half-open files to batter my King's position with his Rooks and Q.  I think it's an innovative move in a difficult position but probably not very sound!} gxh5 22. Nxh5 Nd3 {I'd expected ...Ne4, now that my N had been lured away from covering that square.  I now pondered whether to ignore the attack on my R and go for a quick attack but common sense prevailed.} 23. Rc2 {It took a while to spot the simple elegance of this move, after I'd wasted several minutes on either giving up the Rook (23. Nf6 ?, 23. Qe3?, 23. Rf3?) or wasting its power with 23. Rb1} Rh7 24. Qe2 Rf5 25. g4 {!? my heart in my mouth because of the potential exposure of my King but it brings immediate reward.} Nxf4 {? I think 25.... Rff7 would have been better} 26. Nxf4 Rg5 {??} 27. Nxe6 {! Obvious but strong} Qd7 28. Nxg5 Bxg5 29. Qf3 Qg7 30. Rcf2 Be7 31. e6 {!!  I love this move} Qh6 32. g5 {! Distraction from f8} Qg6 33. Qf8+ {! Everyone likes a Q sac, even when it's obviously leading to Mate.  I thought very carefully about this first, just to make sure I wasn't blundering.} Bxf8 34. Rf2xf8# {Very satisfying.}
