[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {Since I was white the last time, and the tournament is a match, I had to play as black here.  Now, I'm used to Tom playing 1.e4.  With Carl, you can't predict because he changes his openings a lot, but the same is not true with this opponent.  In fact, this is the first time, I've seen Tom play the QPO, as opposed to, the KPO.} d5 {But, I know how to handle, as this is how I answer.  But, I wasn't sure how Tom was going to respond since, as noted above, this is the first time that I've seen him play 1.d4} 2. e3 {Most of them play the QG (2.c4) against me.  But, I think that Tom is aiming to play the Colle's Franketort System against me since this is the second move.} Nf6 {And, I certainly allow it to become the Colle's System, from what I remember.  As, I know that GM Susan Polgar gave variations in her lecture, but I think she said that after 1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6, as played, you have the Colle's System.  The reason for only thinking is that there might have been something that I missed in her variation.  Even if I got it wrong, it doesn't matter because I'm very comfortable here since I've already started developing.} 3. Bb5+ {?! Tom starts by placing me in check.  As far as, I'm concerned, though, this is inaccurate because of what will happen on my next move when I attack the same piece.  I mentioned about the same thing in one of Eric's previous annotations when he also checked with Bb5+.  Black got out of it with a different move, but I mentioned that ...c6 would've done a little damage in exactly the same way.  And, after Tom retreats, I'll prepare to develop another piece.  Having said that, I would've played 3.Nf3, instead.} c6 4. Bd3 g6 {I prepared with the finachetto.  But, I narrowed this down to 2 conditional moves.  As I had also considered 4...e6 with the same idea.  This, however, is where my gut instincts since, similar to what we saw in my training games with kenneth_fiore_3, I was in a, somewhat, difficult, situation where I didn't know what to do.  When that happens, I just go by what my instincts tell me to play.} 5. Nf3 {I'm not surprised to see Tom develop this way, but I've got a surprise for him, as I'm about to indirectly pin this N.} Bg4 6. Nc3 {?! But, this is also an inaccuracy.  I would've gotten out of this pin.  Back in the day, so before advice from kenneth_fiore_3 and nuntar, I'd break it with something like 6.Be2.  As Jack said that getting out of your B is usually the best way to do it.  Now, Ken said that you have to give it a little more thought then that.  I didn't for a while and kept doing it this way since just giving it more thought wasn't good enough.  But, then came Michael's advice.  And, he said that breaking with just the B is calm and passive.  You usually, want to break a pin like this in a more aggressive way since it gets you further.  That's when I changed my method of breaking a pin like this.  Having said that, I would've played 6.h3 here.  However, this is a 1.d4 d5, as opposed to a 1.e4 e5 opening.  So, this move blocks his c pawn.  And, with that, I'll attempt to punish him for that.} Bg7 {Keeping in mind that Tom's c pawn is blocked, I complete my fianchetto once and for all.  I also considered 6...e6 with the idea of 7...Bb4, pinning the N.  But, he'd have 8.a3, followed by 9.Bd2 as a solution to his problem.  So, I figured that this was the way to go since it'll allow me to castle on my next move.  This, however, is what Tom also has in mind since he's about to do it right before me.  Believe it or not, I've played games where my opponent castles on the same wing and at the same time as me.  One or two examples was with Coach Stockel.} 7. O-O O-O 8. Bd2 {Completing his development.} Qb6 {?! But, this is where I think about how I could punish Tom for blocking his c pawn here.  So, I start by going after his c pawn.  The only issue is that I've used my Q, when it can and will be defended easily.  And, I haven't completed my development, at that.  Thus, it was a little premature since Tom will defend by going on the attack, instead.} 9. Na4 Qd8 {I was having Ghost Vision here, but the move played isn't bad.  Having said that, I thought that after 9...Qc7, white attacks again with 10.Nc5.  But, bringing the N there doesn't leave the Q attacked.  And, had I figured that out then, I would've brought the Q to c7 because it would appear to work better with the other pieces.  However, this move is, as good as, 9...Qc7} 10. Nc5 {Trying to strengthen his N.  But, I have an answer to that.} b6 {And, it's with this move.  The reason being is that Jack emphasized that if you let the N come in too much, they become dangerous.  I mentioned in the Chicoboy's Legacy Consultation game with brigadecommander which turned out to be not true there.  In fact, that wasn't the case here since Tom could still respond and, even, go on the offense with 11.Nb7.  But, it was true during the first tournament which I lost way too quickly.  I didn't exchange B for N due to Tunnel Vision, since I was, specifically, too fixated on Susan Polgar's advise of not exchanging B for N.  That would've been the way to go during the first game.  As not exchanging allowed his N to come in too far which allowed a double check that resulted in a loss of material.  And, then, a mating sequence which led to my resignation.} 11. Nb3 {Tom also overlooked 11.Nb7 and went back.  I say this because had I seen this earlier, I would've played 10...Qd7 to stop any ideas that Tom might have with his N.  11.Bc8 was also an option, but I wouldn't have played were I white since it undevelops.} Nbd7 {Keeping in mind that I was a little behind in development, I played this to catch up on it, as I've just completed it, as well.  } 12. Be2 {Meanwhile, Tom breaks the pin, but I had a ready answer for that, as well since he does it calmly.  This means that Jack must have told him the same thing, but 12.h3, as is most cases, was a little stronger here.} Ne4 {So, I start going on the attack with my N.  As my aim is to exchange his B for N since it appears to be better placed.} 13. Bb4 {Tom sees my intention and protects, and then some.  As he is trying to go after my e7 pawn.  What I forgot is that it's not attacked, yet.} Re8 {But, thinking it was, I played this to protect.  I was again, having Ghost Vision because I thought that he had another attacker, so something alongside the B.  So, that if 14.Bxe7?? 14...Qxe7, would instead be the blunder and allow him to win the Q.  But, that's not the case.  If it weren't for that, I would've gone on the offense with 13...a5  Although, as ION noted, Ghost Vision caused a GM to lose, it worked out well for me, this time around.  It's better that I had it here because of what's bound to happen later on.} 14. Nbd2 {Meanwhile, Tom attacks and tries to exchange my N.} a5 {But, this is where I attack his B.  As noted, it works out just as well, and I think better here then it would've move earlier.  Although, theoretically, it doesn't make a difference, I start seeing things accurately, and one or two short variations that I didn't see on my previous move.  As I start slowing down the pace here, whereas, I was moving a little too quickly before which is what led to the Ghost Vision, ironically.} 15. Ba3 Nef6 {I'm not ready to exchange, yet, so I retreat.  But, better might have been to allow the exchange with 15...Ndf6, instead to get my N in a better place.  I'm now thinking about what would happen after 16.Nxe4 dxe4  The N's left attacked twice, but after retreating, I would be hesitant on whether to exchange with 17...Bxe2 or not.  And, while it's good to think about position, overtime, I've learned that it's better not to overthink.  As that's when you forget about the gut instincts and yoga, go through the fight or flight response which causes you to move way too quickly, and make terrible blunders.  So, I give myself less to think about which, ironically, is the opposite of what Ken told me to do of.  But, it works out for me.} 16. Ne5 {The only thing is that Tom's now threatening to exchange N's, on top of winning my N.  That leaves me no choice but to exchange his Be2.  When that happens, then I become ready to exchange his Ne5 since it's better placed then my Nd7.  So, that turns it into an even exchange with a chain of events.  As, Tom exchanges my better B before I exchange his better N.} Bxe2 17. Qxe2 Nxe5 18. dxe5 Nd7 {The only thing is that this is where I'm forced to retreat.  During the set of variations, my original intent was to respond with 18...Ng4?? which would've lost a piece.  But, I don't have a problem with being forced back here since e5 is attacked.} 19. e6 {? And, Tom tries to defend by attacking my Nd7.  But, this is a mistake that will cost him a pawn.  Best was to protect with 19.Nf3.  He'll play this on the next move, but this is an example of where timing is critical.  As bringing the N to f3 was the way to go on this move.} fxe6 20. Nf3 b5 {I wasn't sure what to do.  As with my 4th move, I narrowed it down to 2 candidate moves.  As it was between the move played and 20...Ne5 with the idea of liquidating.  But, my instincts told me to play this since it threatens to win his Ba3.  This is also what I was implying on my 14th move.  As after 14...a5, I saw one or two variations that I missed on my 13th move.  This was the main one which is about to become a reality.} 21. Rad1 {?? And, it's with this move.  I'm not sure why Tom played this.  I guess it was to centralize his R, but that's about guidelines since they say that centralizing the R is one of the ways to control the center.  But, 21.b4 was essential to protect the B.  By playing this, I can and will win a piece for a pawn, which will leave the equivalent to an entire piece up since I won a pawn earlier.  So, that's another good example of where looking at the entire board is more important then thinking about guidelines.} b4 22. e4 {Although, Tom is trying to find an answer for when I take his piece, which we'll see later on, when I blunder.} bxa3 23. bxa3 Ne5 {Meanwhile, I relied on my gut instincts since I didn't know what to do.  So, I, again narrowed it down to 2 conditional moves since the only other thing I considered was 23...Be5.  But, I'd rather liquidate with my N then the B.  } 24. Nxe5 {And, Tom allows it, but better was 24.Na4 or even 24.Ng5 (where the N's not on the rim).  As liquidation favors me here since I'm ahead.} Bxe5 25. exd5 exd5 {?? This is where I overlook that my piece was attacked.  What's even worse, is that 25...cxd5 was the only other thing that I looked.  So, this was one of the fewer times where my instincts were incorrect.  As capturing the other way would've led to the same thing since my Be5 was en-prise.  Best was to protect with 25...Qd6, so that I wouldn't have lost a pawn, either.  In fact, for a different reason, I wound up playing it on my next move, but as noted earlier, timing was critical.  As this is where it was needed.  At this point, however, my time is starting to run low, as I'm down to about 20 minutes against his 28 minutes.  However, even after losing a piece, I feel that I'm still winning, contrary to my game against Carl.  The big difference is the time because I had 8 or 9 minutes less then Tom.  But, I had 21 minutes less against Carl, at the end.  So, with a closer amount of time contrast, between me and Tom, I knew that anything could still happen which is exactly how it occurred.} 26. Qxe5 Qd6 {As noted, I played what would've necessary just a move ago.  But, my big idea is to exchange Q's since he exploited my previous blunder with the same piece.  Tom, however, has answer to that.} 27. Qc3 {As he retreats here.  I think that his idea is to attack a3 but just realized that it's protected by my Q since he's not going to blunder.  But, Carl probably would've made that mistake here since, nowadays, he moves quicker in the tournament then Tom; and it's a bad thing, to make a long story short.  However, after losing to me with Flip Coin Chess, Tom slows down when he sees something like with what I just mentioned.  } Reb8 {But, running a little lower on time now, I moved my R here.  I'm down to 17 or 18 minutes now.  If it weren't for that, I would've remembered that a5 is protected and would've brought my other R to this square (27...Rab8) so that the other R could remain centralized.  However, it's not bad that I overlooked it because the move played will allow me to move my Q, whilst, keeping a5 protected.  That wouldn't have been the case had I used the other R. } 28. Rfe1 {Of course, Tom's trying to target e7, since the idea behind this is Rd2-e2.} Qf6 {But, I put a stop that and threaten f2 by trying, again, to exchange Q's with this move.  I'm not surprised that Tom sees it and protects.  However, that's the other part, as I'm trying to take away as much tempo from Tom as possible since I'm running low on time, again.  I have about 17 minutes remaining, and he's got about 23, so it's even closer now.} 29. Qc5 Rbf8 {As when he protect, I attack f2 a second time knowing how critical the f2 and f7 squares are.  It doesn't matter, as much here as, during the opening.  But, taking would place white in check, after which, I could protect e7 once and for all, which would leave me a pawn up.  That's what I'm keeping in mind here.  } 30. Ref1 {But, Carl, for sure, would've overlooked.  However, I'm not surprised that Tom sees it, and he protects again.} e5 {And, I respond by protecting my pawn.  I'm trying to turn it into a passer which is bound to happen.} 31. c4 {For a while, I was wondering why Tom played this.  But, his goal is to exchange, I then asked myself.  And, I found that what Tom wants is to isolate my pawns.  And, that would've made any hopes that I still had of winning after 25.Qxe5 fail.  As I certainly would've lost on time.} d4 {After figuring that out, I put a stop to his plan with this move.  And, it is a turning point of the time remaining, and thus, the game.  As I am down to only 15 minutes, against his 20 or 21 minutes.  Thus, as of now, I only have a minute more then what I had at the end of my game against Carl.  But, with this move, his time will start to wind down, instead.  For starters, it'll take him about 5 minutes to find a way out.  And, when that happens, he'll wind up with only a minute or two more then me, and even more is bound to happen.} 32. Rde1 {After taking his time, Tom decides to attack e5 again.} Rfe8 {And, I protect again.  This was only way to do, as moving the other R would've lost the pawn, this time around.} 33. Reb1 {For a few seconds, I was wondering why Tom played this.  But, then, I figured out that he's trying to win my c6 pawn since white's threatening 34.Rb6.} d3 {After giving it some thought, my attitude is let him come in since, "passed pawns must be pushed."  If 34.Rb6, I would've answered with 34...d2, right away.  Of course, I wouldn't know how to continue right away, but I'd be focused on what else I could do with the passer. } 34. Qe3 {But, Tom sees my intention and tries to put a stop to it with this move.  However, I have a ready answer to that, as well.} Rad8 {As I also considered 34...e4 but wanted to get my R behind the passed pawn, first.} 35. Qe4 {Tom tries to target c6.  What he and I both forgot is that it was protected by my Q since we're both running low on time.  We now have about 12 minutes left on the clock, give or take a minute or two from one of us.} Rd6 {So, I played this.  But, even if I had remembered that c6 was protected, this would've been my move, regardless.  As my plan is to double up on one file.  I remember this strategy because Carl used that in my last tournament game.  And, it helped him to win a lost game when I got careless due to running low on time.  Even though, I'm not targeting his backrank, this move is just as effective because doubling up will further threaten to promote the pawn.  As I'll have more to defend with then Tom will have to attack with.  After this move, it'll take Tom a minute or two to figure out what to do.  That'll leave him with about 9 or 10 minutes which is, for the first time this game, a minute or two less then what I have left over.} 36. c5 {But, Tom goes on the attack.} Rd4 {The only other move I considered was 36...Rc5 in an attempt to win c5.  But, for the final time this game, I went by my gut instincts here, after realizing that Tom could then defend by moving one of his R's to c1.  So, my instincts told me to play this to give Tom more to think about, especially since, I wasn't going to leave my passed pawn en-prise.} 37. Qe3 Red8 {But, this is the main turning point of the game, as I have doubled up.  During the last time 2 moves, Tom only had a minute or 2 (I think 2) minutes less then I had.  But, that was about 9 left.  Since I'm have a further threat with my d2 pawn (which if I promote) Tom's lost; it takes him 5 minutes to figure out what to do.  Once he does that, he'll have, exactly 4 minutes on the clock, whereas, I have 9 or 10 left.  At this point, I was 100% confident that I had a win, even without an immediate mate or loss of material.  As I knew that I could time him out.  But, that was not the case, before now.} 38. Qd2 {This is more or less forced because if Tom moves anywherelse, I'd break right through with 38...d2.} Qf4 {And, I respond by attempting to exchange Q's.  I know that he's going refuse, and what I forgot is that he'll be able to capture on a5.  But, it doesn't matter, as once he does that, I'll break though with 39...d2 which is where I thought that he could not stop me from promoting.} 39. Qxa5 d2 40. Rbd1 {But, he finds this move.  Nontheless, it doesn't matter because Tom is down to about 2 minutes left on the clock.  So, a win by default is very near.  } e4 {Keeping that in mind, I push this pawn.  The idea is a pawn chain since I have a later ...e3 in mind.} 41. Qc3 {Not realizing the time issue, but getting more nervous about my passed pawn, he attacks again.  We both forgot that it's defended again since I have 2 R's.} Rd4d3 {Having said that, I attack his Q, again.} 42. Qc4+ {Even though we're, in general, supposed to follow tournament rules, Jack's not as strict about talking.  But, he told us to keep to a minimal during a tournament.  That's because besides check, or it's a draw by rep, etc, if you talk too much; it's also considered cheating, and you'd be disqualified.  Having said that, Tom smiles and says, "This is my first check, so far."  Of course, I also smile since I know that Tom is just about to time out.  He's down to, at most, a minute left on the click, and I think it's more like 30 seconds here.} Kh8 {Keeping that in mind, I just get out this way.  Since I'm also running low on time with, at most, 7 minutes, I just keep in mind what Coach Stockel said a while back.  That you usually want to place your K in the corner.  In reality, it doesn't matter, in this position, but I was just going to keep things simple here.} 43. Qc2 {Tom is still focused on trying to get my pawn.} e3 {But, being low on time, myself, I forgot that it was protected, and just play this.  As I was prepared for 44.fxe3, with which, I would quickplay 44...Qxe3+} 44. Qb2+ {But, Tom quick played this to place me in check.  I also had a ready answer to that.} Kg8 {And, it was with this move to give Tom something else to think about it.  All, that's all I needed because with less then 30 seconds, he started thinking.  And, that's when he timed out.  Once that happened, I announced a win by informing that the flag just dropped.  I wasn't going to wait because if I had, it wasn't a question of if, but when I'd also time out.  What I noted in the last tournament game was what happens when you run out of time.  But, if both players time out, it's a draw.  It's not a question but when that would happen because I knew it would occur with only 6 minutes left on my clock.  Once this game finished out, we played a little more to find out what would happen, had he not timed out, starting with 45.fxe3 Qxe3+.  But then, we actually ran out of time (for real) because I had to adjourn to get ready for work.  Then, Jack asked me how it went, which he always does.  It's mainly to make sure that we didn't move too quick.  When, I told him that Tom lost on time.  But, I also mentioned that I only had 6 minutes left on the clock which he said is what's supposed to happen during a tournament since it's being at the last minutes. Jack responded by saying, "Really.  You're making this tournament very interesting."  I told him that the notebook was everything because without it, I would've, again, lost in only 10-20 minutes.  It was right in front of the other members, and when Carl heard this, his jaw dropped.  Well, that's what I wanted since he told spectulated that my mistake against him, the last time, might have been caused by using up my time with the notebook.  But, it's sending Jack's message that taking your time is the way to be successful.  And, this game proved that to be true.  That's not to mention that, in contrast to the last game, I've adjusted now to taking notes during a tournament.  But, it happened even quicker then I anticipated.}
