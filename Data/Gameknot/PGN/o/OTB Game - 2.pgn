[Opening "Ruy Lopez (Spanish opening) (C60)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The only person who I don't know what to expect from is Carl.  But, when I play against Tom Walsh as white, it's the Ruy Lopez.} Bd6 {?! But, Tom generally responds with 3...a6  This is inaccurate because just like what I mentioned in Erika's annotations, this blocks off his center pawn.  Almost anything was better then this move since e5 was already protected.} 4. O-O {Trying to figure out what tiny advantage I might have, being that Tom's center is semi blocked, I castle, immediately.  As I am treating this like the Berlin Defense since I castle just as quickly.} Nd4 {Going after my Bishop.} 5. Nxd4 {Instead of retreating, I exchange to double up his pawns in the center which is generally where you don't want them.} exd4 6. d3 {And, I block his pawn from advancing, whilst, achieving a pawn chain.  Of course, I plan to do something with my Bc1 in order to develop.} a6 {But, this attack delays for a move.} 7. Bc4 Nf6 {But, things became easy again once he developed his N, as now, I'm gonna pin it.} 8. Bg5 Be5 {Of course, I though that he was going to break it with 8...Be7 or 8...a6  Not doing that is, already, making me feel lucky.  I know it's not an automatic win, but I am now feeling extremely comfortable with my position.  In fact, it's even more so then it was with kenneth_fiore_3.  I shouldn't have felt comfortable with Ken since I was lost, but I was right to be comfortable here.} 9. Nd2 {This is one of the reasons why, as now, my development is complete, whereas, Tom has a ways to go before completing his development.  Of course, he'll get there, but I'm ahead in that and despite material being, I have a space advantage here since I can and will manoeuvre this N to a more powerful square on my next move.} d6 {Preparing to develop his Bc8.  But, this is even more of a reason for my next move.  As now, I'm prepared to exchange which for me is beneficial since it's B for N.  Grandmaster Susan Polgar implied that, in general, a B is worth more then a N, and I go by that especially here since it has more mobility then my N. } 10. Nf3 Bg4 {Of course, I was anticipating this move.  But, I have a way around this pin, easily.} 11. h3 {Even if the B weren't blocked (which would've left 11.Be2 an option), I would've played this, anyway, since it is more aggressive.  As I had been criticized by Ken for breaking pins like this too passively.} Be6 {Threatening to exchange my B for his.} 12. Nxe5 {But, I exchange here first since his Be5 was even stronger.  Then, I'll exchange his Be6.  I'd normally refuse to exchange since it generally eases the tension.  It actually does so here, but this time, it's at the expense of a pawn.  Therefore, even if it were not forced, as it is here, I would not refrain from doing it.  } dxe5 13. Bxe6 fxe6 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 15. Qh5+ {So, I try the same method that you see in the Domiano's Defense.  Although it doesn't work here, I have something planned.} g6 16. Qf3 {Since I'm feeling extremely comfortable, I go ahead and exchange Q's.  It wasn't the best choice since when playing this, Tom said, "Yes" and just exchanged.  So, there must have been tension which I didn't realize.  But, in one of her earlier annotations fiercequeen implied that the one thing to exchange quickly are Q's as it boils down to an endgame even sooner.  Well that's what I kept in mind here.} Qxf3 17. gxf3 Rg8 {Trying to get a passed pawn which is typical of one moving the R back and forth behind one pawn and then the other.  So, I assume that's what he wants to do.  I would've castled short here, instead.} 18. c3 {I am starting to figure out a way to get a passed pawn.  It won't show here, but it's what my thought process, as I am already planning a strategy at this phase of the game and am thinking along a variation that might do this.  It does happen, but not until much later on.} O-O-O {Surprisingly, Tom decides to castle long.  I don't think that this was the way to go, but castling short isn't an option here, either.  Instead, I would've played ...Kf7 later on, and then, brought the R to e8, and then play ...Kf8.  However, my immediately response would've been 18...dxc3 as that would've just stopped the variation that I'm thinking of right now.  Of course, it need not come true either, but there would just be less for me to work with.  On the other hand, I considered exchanging here but wanted to leave with doubled pawns since they're isolated from his c and g pawns.} 19. c4 {So, I advance, instead.  Don't forget that I'm just at the very beginning of trying to figure something out.} Rg7 {Of course, this would be the start of Tom trying to stop it.} 20. Rac1 {So, I treat c4 like a passed pawn by bringing my R right behind it.  Even though things won't go as, exactly planned, I have something to work with which is the point that I wanted to reach.} c5 {Of course, he blocks this pawn from advancing, and this is where I realized that it won't go as planned.  But, it doesn't take me that long to figure something else out.} 21. a3 {So, I go with a pawn chain because of what I'm about to on my next move.} Rdg8 {Trying to put some dangerous pressure on my King.  However, the first thing that I keep in mind is that his R's are blocked in by his g6 pawn.} 22. b4 {Therefore, I initiate an exchange, knowing that when he accepts, I'll be a step closer to getting a passed pawn.  Then, it'll become about figuring out a way to do it.} cxb4 23. axb4 g5 {Trying to free up his R.} 24. c5 {But, knowing just how close I might be to getting a passed pawn, I advance even further since I have a pawn chain, as does Tom.  The difference is that mine is further up.} Rc7 {Of course, this is a common way to prevent it.} 25. Rcb1 {So, I change gears knowing that c5 is protected.} h5 {Of course, Tom has similar plans.} 26. Rfc1 {Knowing that he can't take, I bring other R over and start working my way from there.} Rf8 {Going right after one of my doubled pawns.} 27. Kg2 {So, I protect.} Kd7 {Clearing a space for his Rf8, so that he can move it on the 8th rank. } 28. b5 {Thinking that he would try to stop c5 pawn with something 28...Rfc8, I immediately advance.  As I felt that exchanging eases the pressure for me.  Yet, that is his best option, anyway, to prevent that pawn from doing damage.} axb5 29. Rxb5 Ke7 {I presume that Tom was trying to play ...Kf6-g7/} 30. Rb6 {It doesn't bother me since I go to the next level, anyhow by ramping up pressure of my own.} Rb8 31. c6 {! This is where I threaten to get a passed pawn.  It's better then I realize.} bxc6 {?? Of course this is a blunder.  I believe that Tom played as he thought that this gives him an unstoppable passed pawn.  But, this move should cost him the R.  Best was to capture the other way.  Of course, I'd have threats after 32.Rcxc6, but it's better then losing a R.  Of course, I miss the opportunity on too many occasions.} 32. Rcb1 {Of course, I missed the opportunity to win his R.  I fixated on doubling up onto one file.  But, best was 32.Rxb8, at once.} Kf6 33. Rc1 {?? I still missed that opportunity since I start to become worried about this pawn.  In fact, this is a major blunder since he can win my Rook.} h4 {So, best was 33...Rxb6.  And, we both miss opportunities for the next 7 moves.  So, I feel that it's not worth annotating that part since the best moves are obvious which we overlook on all occasions.} 34. Rc5 g4 35. f4 gxh3+ 36. Kxh3 Ke7 37. Rxe5 Kd6 38. Rh5 Ra7 39. Rb4 Ra3 40. Rxd4+ {Even though the opportunity is gone, this is significant.  Although I don't have a passed pawn, yet, it can't be prevented any longer.  In fact, this was the start to my plan on the 13th move which I started and carried through up until now where I know that it's gonna happen.} Kc7 41. Re5 Rd8 42. Rxd8 {But, this is where I take advantage of my opportunity and liquidate Rooks since Tom's Rd8 was a threat.  I also know that when all is said and done, I can and will win a pawn. } Kxd8 43. Rxe6 {Not earlier, but now is where I get the passed pawn.  However, I had something like this planned out for the last 30 moves.  Even with what I missed, this shows the significance of thinking and planning ahead.  It starts by trying to come up with a plan and then seeing if you can follow up with the plan.  Although not immediate, it worked here, and that's why it paid off to get more and more comfortable.} Rxd3+ 44. Kxh4 Rf3 {Trying to win my f4 pawn, but I won't let him do it.  So, I'll give up my other pawn.  Thus, this is the first sac, which wasn't planned.  But, it was here where I realized that my passed pawns on e4 and f4 could not be stopped.  So, I become not just comfortable but happy here.} 45. f5 Rxf2 46. f6 {And, this very first thing that I keep in mind here is that passed pawns must be pushed.  Of course, Tom will deliver a series of checks, but that does not bother me.} Rh2+ 47. Kg5 Rg2+ 48. Kf5 Rf2+ 49. Ke5 {However, this is where I figure out that Tom is trying to trick me with a 3 fold repetition.  But, I had been fooled by that too many times.  So, without realizing the position had appeared twice, but I backtracked and asked myself why he kept placing me in check.  Well, that was the reason, but then it was out of the three times that he's trying, how many times did Tom get me to repeat the position.  Well, it was twice, so this is where I stop him by playing something that Tom did not expect.  Afterall, I know that I have a won game and am not willing to give it up.} c5 {Doing what he can for counterplay, Tom pushes his passed pawn.} 50. Rc6 {But, I put a stop to that by knowing that I can and, eventually, will take.  But, I have another idea first.  Since it's about how to continue, especially with my remaining pawns.} Rg2 51. Ke6 {It's right here.  As you also want to guide your passed pawn with a King.  The two together become extremely powerful which is one of the main way that your K becomes a powerful weapon in the endgame.} Rg6 {Doing what he can to stop it, Tom pins.  But, I'm not troubled by it since I'll just go ahead and take his remaining pawn.} 52. Rxc5 Rg8 {Trying to push my King, as Tom is planning to check with 52...Re8+} 53. Kf7 {But, I get there first.} Rg4 {So, he targets my e4 pawn.  } 54. e5 {Like before, however, it doesn't bother me here.} Rg5 {Still trying to prevent by pinning my e5.  Of course, I can respond with 55.Ke6 but refrain to prevent Tom from pinning my f6 pawn with 55...Rg6.  So, this is where I remember what happened between clashofpawns and jstevens1, as I'm about to explain below.} 55. e6 {This is where I used the same method that Sasha used against Joann.  If you want to do it from the mathematical perspective, I converted the equation here.  I'd normally not give up the Rook, but considering that I have connected and can just break through with check, I gave this to him.  So, this was a deflective sac because my own Rook was preventing my passed pawns from advancing and promoting, so giving it up allowed me to do this.  Another way of looking at the spectrum is a change of romodel since it was first clashofpawns with her passed pawn, and then, I followed up, as well.} Rxc5 56. e7+ Kc7 57. e8=Q Rc6 {Of course, Tom is doing what he can in his last hopes of counterplay.  But, this is where I would resign because white's advantage is overwhelming.} 58. Qe5+ Kb6 59. Qd4+ Kc7 60. Qf4+ Kd7 61. Qe4 {Tom resigned here because I have an overwhelming advantage.  Black would have to play 61...Kd6 or 61...Kc7 to protect the Rook.  I would've then considered sacking my Queen for his Rook and then push the f pawn forward.  But, I wouldn't have even done that.  Instead, I would've played 62.Kg7 to allow 63.f7 where I'd either promote to a second Q or underpromote to a R.  From there, I'd be able to confine his King to the eighth rank where mate would not be far off.  Tom knew what was coming and gave up.  I'm not as good with math as clashofpawns.  Yet, I was able to use some of it and make a conversion to reach this final position where I was able to force the win, despite missed opportunities earlier.}
