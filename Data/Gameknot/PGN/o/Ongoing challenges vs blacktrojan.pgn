1. e4 {Game note: “I'm 4-1 vs him. My loss was black. He plays uncommon openings. Can't remember what he does vs Sicilian. Let's see...” } c5 2. Bc4 {Game note: “just remember somebody else played this opening and I went dragon which may not have been ideal” } d6 3. d3 {In hindsight I noticed this pins-in his LSB. } Nf6 4. h3 e6 5. Nf3 Be7 6. g4 Nc6 7. Bb5 O-O 8. Be3 {Game note: “8.Be3 I think Nc3 would have been better because now I have ...d5”  Post analysis shows a clear -0.82 with 8…Qb6 and yes …d5 is also a good option. } d5 9. e5 Qc7 {I immediately noticed my woops??  9…Nxe5 10.Nxe5 Qa5+ 11.Nd2 Qxb5 would have been great or just the simple …Nd7. } 10. exf6 gxf6 {Game note: “10...gxf6 is ugly but not sure about ...Bxf6”.  I still wasn’t seeing …Qa5+ was I? } 11. Bh6 {Game note: “?  11.Bxc5.” } Re8 12. Kd2 Bf8 13. Bxf8 Rxf8 14. Qe2 {Game note: “12.Kd2 and 14.Qe2 not a clue what he's doing so I'm moving in to snatch his LSB. Around move 18 or so I may need to move my c-pawn out of the way to allow my Q to slide back to the K-side.”  He wasted a big material advantage. } Qa5+ 15. Nc3 d4 16. Bxc6 bxc6 17. g5 dxc3+ 18. bxc3 c4 {Computer didn’t see this move.  It was looking for an immediate Q retreat to d8 or some resolution of the k-side pawns with 18…fxg5.  Once it analyzes the text move it comes to the same conclusion.  Weird. } 19. gxf6 Qf5 20. Rag1+ Kh8 21. Rg3 {Game note: “21.Rg3 now I have a few options ...cxd3 ...Qxf6 ...Rf8 ...Rb8 and watch for ...Rd8 if that file opens up. He's got the option to double his R's. I'm only at -1 material so could be worse. Allowing his Q to e3-h6-g7 would be catastrophic.”  By the way 21.Qe5 would have been better, removing one of the only defenders of my K-side. } cxd3 22. cxd3 Qxf6 23. Qe5 {Game note: “23.Qe5 so he wants a Q trade. I think it’s too late because I still wanna play ...Rb8 but if Nxc6 then ...Bb7 pins his N to his R on h1. Having said that, his e5 N is dangerous on account of Nxf7+ so I'll kick that away first with 26...f6.” } Qxe5 24. Nxe5 f6 25. Nxc6 {nope} Bb7 26. Re1 Bxc6 27. Rxe6 Bd5 28. Ra6 Bh1 {Game note: “28...??? ...Rb8 getting tougher to play. Now thinking ...Bh1 (better central control), ...Rf7, or ...f5 first.” } 29. c4 Rf7 {I felt it was forced.} 30. f3 Rg7 31. Rxg7 Kxg7 32. Ke3 Bg2 33. Kf2 {33.Kf2? } Bxh3 34. f4 Bf5 35. Rd6 h5 36. Rd5 {Game note: “36.Rd5 but advancing his centre pawns needs to be his main tactic.” } Kg6 37. d4 h4 {Game note: “37...Rh4 = 3 steps to becoming a Q”  } 38. c5 h3 39. Kg3 Re8 {Added pressure.} 40. Rxf5 Kxf5 41. c6 Re3+ 42. Kf2 Kxf4 {I have a big advantage now.} 43. d5 Rc3 44. Kg1 Kg3 45. Kf1 h2 46. d6 h1=Q+ {Time to set a mating net.} 47. Ke2 Qe4+ 48. Kf1 Rc1# {}
