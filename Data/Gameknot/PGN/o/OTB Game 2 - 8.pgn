[Opening "Queen's pawn game, Chigorin variation (D02)"]

1. d4 {Instead of opening with my usual 1.e4, I played this.  After looking into the loss with Jack Stockel, combined with, my game against Kenneth_fiore_3 and pagmatic64, it occurred to me that I need to work more on playing the Colle's System or against the KID.  It depends on how Loyd answers. } d5 {But, with this move, however, it'll be the Colle's System because 1...Nf6 is played in the KID.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {?! An inaccuracy.  Better was 2...Nf6  The idea is that, in 1.d4 openings, Nc3, or ...Nc6 should not be played until the c pawn has advanced because you need that pawn.  With this move, I'll see if I have an edge.  If so, I'll try to take advantage of it.} 3. e3 {Sticking to the mainlines of the Colle's System, however.  And, after this move, he does the same thing.} e6 4. b3 {Like with the KID, Q side fianchetto's are common.  But, I was debating between this or 4.g3, but as a rule of thumb, I'm going by what Ken told me in our training game.  First, I'm treating this, as though, I was playing against the Colle's System, in which, this is better.  Second, like with that defense, in the Colle's System, K side fianchetto's, in my books, are unwise.  My idea now is to not play the wrong move so early, as that's how I wind up in trouble.  The idea being is that the position would detoriate, which I'm not ready for yet.} Bd6 {Continuing with his development.} 5. Bb2 {So, do I, whilst, sticking to what I consider to be the mainlines.} Nf6 {Continuing with his development and preparing to castle short, as do I.  In fact, Loyd will castle on his next move.  Once that happens, I'll castle, as well.} 6. Bb5 O-O 7. O-O a6 {Hitting my Bb5.  I was hesitate on deciding whether to take, or not.  I am keeping in mind what Ken said about not exchanging for the thrills of it.  But, I decide to do it, anyway.  However, it's not because I can (which has been done before the training.)  The real reason behind taking is due to, in my opinion, Loyd leaving himself with a weakness by playing 2...Nc6 before advancing the c pawn.  So, I was trying to take advantage of that weakness which you want to do in chess.  That's because I view that N as worth more then my B since I think I know what it's capable.  By taking it, my thought process, is that black will wind up in trouble.} 8. Bxc6 bxc6 9. Nbd2 {But, since my c pawn hasn't advanced, I'm sticking to those guidelines, whilst, completing my development.  At this point, I'm getting more and more confident since what I considered to be his strongest minor piece is a goner.} Ne4 {Finding a better outpost for his N.  I guess Loyd wants to exchange.  I know that it'll be inevitable.  But, I delay.  This time, it is due to what Ken told me, as I'm not ready to exchange now.  I will be, however, on the next move.  But, I'll let him, as TA calls it, "draw first blood"  In this context, I'll let him take first, before I do anything.  That's because exchanging right now, will lose tempo since my Nf3 will be attacked.  By delaying, this won't happen, and then, I'll try to exploit, what I assume to be, an advantage.  In other words, I'll try to keep it.} 10. Re1 {So, I centralize my Rook.  The exchange is going to occur, but as noted, I'm now ready.} Nxd2 11. Qxd2 Re8 {Centralizing his Rook.} 12. e4 {Advancing my e pawn.  In this context, I'm trying to exchange it with his d pawn.  As I feel that Loyd might be up to something with it.} f6 {But, he declines it, which allows me to follow up on plan B.  That's attacking the Bishop, so that when he retreats, I can get rid of his weakest pawn by exchanging.  As now, not only am I more comfortable, but I'm happy with my position.  In fact, I believe that I'm nearing a forced win but will not underestimate him as I don't know what he capable.  Sure enough, I am wrong, but it doesn't come until much later on.  However, if I attempted to be 100% sure of myself, the loss would occur much more quickly.} 13. e5 Be7 14. exf6 Bxf6 15. Ne5 {As now, I attempt to exchange, but specifically, for a nasty threat against Loyd.  In this case, my idea of a good time is 15...Bxe5, 16.Rxe5, with the plan being 17.Qg5, and then, doubling up where I'll have attacking forces (which could be overwhelming) against his monarch.  } Bb7 {He declines.} 16. Re3 {?? So, I go to plan B, with this move.  I felt that I could bring my Q, a R, and N into action.  But, this is where I start becoming overly confident as I overlooked his next move which happens to be a skewer.  Consequently, this is going to lose material and give Loyd a near winning advantage which I don't realize until much later on.} Bg5 17. Rae1 {But, when he takes, I'll get something in return.  After which, the plan is similar to before and involves some nasty threats.} Bxe3 18. Rxe3 Qe7 {Already starting to see what I might be up to.} 19. Rf3 {But, it doesn't stop me from playing this.} Ref8 {Stopping one of the threats that I had in mind.  But, my next move carries a similar threat.  The variations I calculated where winning the Queen for Rook or mating him.  It's complicated to explain those variations, but they involved a lot of Homework.  I'm not surprised that he stopped them, but when it's gone, once and for all, that's when I start realizing my fate on how the bad the position is.} 20. Rg3 {As now, I'm planning to win back a pawn.} c5 21. Qh6 {So, this is where I try to follow up since the plan involves 22.Rxg7+, Qxg7 23.Qxg7+, Kxg7  And, what I'm keeping in mind is that Loyd cannot capture with his g7 since it's pinned.  I remember doing something like this against Ted after seeing how bhidragon did it with me.  Not surprisingly, however, it won't work.  But, my idea of a good time is putting pressure on him which happened because in the end, Loyd said that he, for a while, didn't know what to do.  He figured it out but with great difficulty which is, as Ken mentioned, what pressure is all about.} Qf6 {Not to my surprise, Loyd stops that with this move.  So, I try to come up with another plan.  One thing I kept in mind is that he wants to liquidates Queen.  The problem is that I'm actually in worse trouble then you could imagine.  That's because the only way to save the position is liquidating Queens.  But, then, I'd redeem it as resignable since there is nothing else to learn when you're down R for B, and have exchanged the most powerful piece on the board.} 22. Qh3 {?? Thinking that I still had a good fight left, this was played to avoid the liquidation.  But, the only way to keep this game alive would've been liquidating with 22.Qxf4.  It turns out that this loses immediately because of...} Qxf2+ {This move, as now 23.Kh1 is forced, and then comes 23...Qf1# which is mate.  When the game was over, Loyd and I analyzed this.  According to him, 22.Qh3 was my only mistake since I had a strong position with his pieces tied down where he was struggling to find an answer with my forces against his monarch.  That's how I also concluded that he felt the pressure after 21.Qh6.  But, he rightly pointed out that, sometimes, it only takes one mistake to lose the game which Jack Stockel agreed with.  In fact, Jack made note of that while annotating Tom's game against a master (which Tom almost won but made one mistake and lost.)  I, however, disagree that 22.Qh3?? was the only blunder.  It lost quicker, but I was in rough shape, right after allowing the skewer with 16.Re3?? because black was either going to win my Rook or my Queen.  Afterwhich, I was not going to have compensation, and despite some counterplay, the position was only going to go downhill white, until I was in that situation where liquidation was needed to prevent mate.  Not only that, but had I known that 22.Qxf6 was needed, resignation would've been imminent for me.  In other words, I would've resigned, right then and there. }
