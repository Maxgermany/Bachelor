[Opening "QGD (D32), Tarrasch, von Hennig-Schara gambit"]

1. d4 {A nifty miniature that has Black misplay an opening with disastrous results } d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 {Queen's Gambit Declined, leading to a dynamic position here - not sure if there is a specific variation associated with this position but it looks exciting! } 4. cxd5 cxd4 {Exchanging of pawns? } 5. dxe6 {! Nope! } dxc3 {?? Black should know better than to trust this - notice how the king is the only piece defending the queen? fxe6 seems to be the only viable move here } 6. exf7+ {Step 1... } Ke7 {Only move that preserves the queen, but... } 7. fxg8=N+ {! Nifty use of promotion! The knight had access to f6 and White removes that protection - with tempo! } Rxg8 8. Bg5+ {Obvious - Game, Set and Match! Short but sweet game! }
