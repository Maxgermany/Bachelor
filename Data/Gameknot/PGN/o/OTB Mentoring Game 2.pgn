[Opening "Sicilian (B56), Venice attack"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual.} c5 {Although his main response is 1...e5, he plays this often.  Not only is this Jack's second most common response, but I've evaluated.  I'd say that he answers with 1...e5 55% of the time and this move 45% of the time.  So, I'm used to it and as usual, we're going into the variation that he taught me which is the Open Variation.  The reason being is that he, as Homework, made me study the next move up through 5.Nc3 until it became second nature.  As he told me that this is the main variation of the Sicilian.  The approach is wrong, as the reason for this teaching is because this part of the Sicilian is the most analyzed by Masters and GM's according to him.  The truth is that it's not about what's most analyzed, but rather, what you have the most experience with.  With that being said, it works because by teaching me this line, I have the most experience.  So, when 1.e4, I have a couple of conditional moves like 1...e5 with which 2.Nf3.  But, the same is true when they play 1...c5  The difference is that the variations are a little different, but I just memorize them which isn't the best way to go since understanding is a little better.  However, it blends in with my style of play.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {The move that Jack made me remember was 5...a6.  The difference is that I understand, as opposed to, memorize the move.  As the reason is to prevent 6.Bb5+ or 6.Nb5, and I keep that in mind as we're about to see.  For now, I must defend.} 6. Nf3 Nc6 {Instead of 6...a6, Jack played this to develop.  But, this is where I understand and remember why ...a6 is played, and therefore, try to take advantage with my next move.  As the idea is to prevent what I'm about to do.} 7. Bb5 Bd7 {I am not surprised that Jack broke the pin this way since he said that you mainly use the B.  Seeing what else I can do, I decide to pin the other N.  And, I'm not surprised that Jack breaks it in the same way.  In fact, 8...Be7 is a conditional move as I had planned this.  For once he does that, I will castle, at once.  } 8. Bg5 Be7 9. O-O a6 {This move took me off guard a little.  But, I knew what to do.  } 10. Bd3 Nb4 {I forgot that Jack had this move.  Not that it matters.  Jack's real goal is to exchange my B for N.  As I posted with what I learned from GM Susan Polgar, you should not exchange unless you have a really good reason for doing so.  What she's mainly alluding is B for N, but evaluating the N is also important.  The idea being is that with how many squares they can cover, a B is usually worth more then a N.  I felt that this was true here, so similar to what kenneth_fiore_3 I'm not going to exchange either.  I'm sure that 11.Be2 is a conditional move for the same reason that 8...Be7 was a conditional move.  He knew that I wouldn't exchange so the idea is castling, when I retreat which is what happens.  However, castling is also conditional, as that's when I'll take advantage of my opportunity to attack his N.} 11. Be2 O-O 12. a3 Nc6 13. Qd3 {Contrary to before, I didn't know what to do.  But, given that I have castled and am fully developed, my plan was to connect and maybe even double up my Rooks.  The way to do this is by bringing my Q in action.} h6 {I was a little surprised to see this.  But, I knew how to handle the situation.} 14. Be3 Ng4 {Of course, similar to before, I overlooked this move.  As now, Jack is, threatening to exchange B for N.  For the same reason that I mentioned on his 10th move, I refuse to exchange.} 15. Bd2 b5 {This is the first time where I am not sure why Jack played this.  I believe that it was to get a pawn chain since the a and b pawns are better connected.} 16. Nd5 {Although I should spend time to figure out why Jack played this, the reason doesn't matter to me, at all.  I felt that Jack should've defended better with something like 16...Be6 to prevent my N from coming up.  He previously told me some time ago that you have to be weary of what those N's can do.  By that, he was implying what TA taught which is about N Visualization Count.  The idea is preventing the N from coming this far as once it advances far enough, it can become quite dangerous.  Well, that's the first thing that I kept in mind which is the reason behind this move.  In fact, my original plan this move was to play 17.Nb6  As it was his Jack's Bd7 that I wanted to exchange knowing that he must recapture with the Q.  Afterwhich, I thought that I had an advantage.  But, Jack prevents that with his next move.} Be6 17. Nxe7+ {But, I really didn't want to exchange this B.  That's why my original play was 17.Nc3??  But, Jack answered with 17...Bc4  I realized from that point that I was going to lose a piece since it's a skewer as now the Q is attacked and must move.  That's when he said that after 16...Be6 exchanging with 17.Nxe7+.  In fact, he said, "And, that's why you came up with the Knight.  You wanted to exchange so why didn't you do that."  I then told him that it wasn't this B, but rather, the other one that I wanted to exchange.  But, once he moved that, it wasn't possible.  He said that there was no choice as this is the only way out of trouble.  Of course, the idea being is that it is an intermediate check to prevent the loss of material.  For were he not in check, nothing would've stopped 17...Bc4  Once that happened, we went back, and I played this.} Qxe7 {I had expected 17...Nxe7 where his Q appears stronger.  Thus, when Jack played this, I was happy about where I stand.} 18. Qc3 {Of course, Jack is still threatening 18...Bc4, so I put an end to that by attacking his N.} Rac8 {I thought that Jack would protect by retreating it.  But, he did it this way which is more powerful.  } 19. Rad1 {The only reason behind this move was to centralize one of my Rooks since it is in the center.  But, slightly better was to move to my Q, as Jack could have launched a discovered attack with 19...Na7.} Bc4 {But, he attacks my Be2.  That should've occurred to me.  I underestimated the position and thought that, at worst he exchanges which is a burden but nothing serious.  But, the way I'm thinking is about to cost me the game.  As I think about other things besides that (which should be my main focus.)} 20. b4 {?? With that being said, I become fixated on the pawn chain just like what Jack has.  But, I miss the next move.  Therefore, this is the losing move.  In this case, exchanging with 20.Bxc4 was forced.  The obvious move for Jack would've been 20...Bxe2 which wins a piece as well as R for B right away.  However, he is about to play something just as powerful which leads to the same result.} Nd4 {As Jack adds another attacker.  I resigned here only because he will win a piece, as well as, a piece R for B.  Although he could play that right away, it'll happen on the next move, anyway.  For, if I try to dispute this with 20...Bxc4?? he forks and wins the Q with 21.Nxe2+  The difference between this and a regular mentoring game was that Jack didn't know exactly where I went wrong here.  But, he did know that I originally played 17.Nc3??.  After that, he lost track which isn't how it usually goes.  I picked up and realized that my last move 20.b4?? was, in fact, the decisive mistake.  Instead, I should've exchanged right away with 20.Bxc4 to prevent this.  What led to this mistake was the way that I was thinking, my thought process.  As my thought was that he was just trying to compromise my position by threatening to exchange which Ken mentioned in a couple of annotations after our first training game.  I should've, however, expanded that by realizing that there's an immediate threat here.  Had I paid better attention to that, I would've put an immediate stop to this.}
