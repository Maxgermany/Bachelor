1. e4 e5 {With Jack Stockel, I'd expect it.  But, the thing with Bert is that I didn't know what he would play, as this was the first time I played against him.  And, after 1.e4, since the Siclian Defense is commonly played, but this is, as well.  So, I wasn't sure how he's respond as there's lots of choices, but I was prepared for anything he'd do with the saying, "Expect the unexpected."  This is why it's my model.  Afterall, GM elyhim the Carro Kann, which I was unprepared for, and therefore, led to Hope Chess, Flip Coin Chess, and eventually, unsound agression and, at one point, cheapo tactics which led to my downfall as I played way to fast and went for threats that were too obvious to drive off.  Since I improved, I promised myself not be taken off guard which is why, "Expect the Unexpected" is my model.  And, for those wondering, I am all but certain that joveyboy1 learned that term from me because after I used it, he then used it in one or two of his annotations.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {I'd figured he played this, but, like before, I really wasn't certain how he's respond as the Petroff Defense is also common.  But, once he played this, I was automatically going to play Ruy Lopez.  Now, here's the thing, I was once told that it's generally not a good idea to play the Ruy Lopez against much stronger players.  However, I disagree with him.  The idea being is that I have defeated Jack Stockel on one or two occassions with the Ruy Lopez.  And, when I do lose, which is supposed to happen, I still play extremely well.  In other words, it's a good loss because I, generally, don't go wrong into the end.  And, this was no exception because of how well I wind up playing.} 3. Bb5 Nd4 {I usually don't see this, but likewise, I'm not surprised as Jack has, on or two occassions, played this against me.  So, I know what to do.  As usual, I exchange, but for a different reason.  Going by what C++ said, it isn't exchange early and often as what used to.  But, here that N is powerful, and I consider to be a bit overwhelming because of how dangerous they're known to be.  To prevent the Fight or Flight Syndrome, which isn't supposed to happen or getting overwhelmed, I decide that the best thing to do is exchange.  That way, I'm taking care of something, before it can become a problem.  It is worth noting that confidence is very important to prevent you from getting anxious because as Jack says which I emphasize to my students, "Don't get nervous."  Plus, I'm already planning something with the in between which is strategy, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  The strategy being the exchange to enable castling, right after.} 4. Nxd4 exd4 5. O-O c6 {Not at all surprised.  I knew, at some point, he'd played this.  In fact, I thought that Bert would do this right here after the exchange.  And, when you think about it, this makes sense.  Now, you get into minds of how stronger players feel.  Now I know, as black anticipated that I'd force the exchange with the idea being to castle and afterwards, he gain tempo by playing this.} 6. Ba4 b5 {Now, I really had to evaluate, if 7.Bb3 was safe.  As some will recall, in an annotation by someone who I also mentored, he annotated a move, and I said the B should've move back, as would be here.  And, they accurately pointed out that I was wrong, as he'd lose the B, when the opponent boxes it in with one of my pawns.  Then, in one of my more recent games, I made that same mistake.  So, I really had to evaluate, and as usual which is why it's important, do my HW, to figure out if 7.Bb3, and if not, how he'd win a piece.  After careful considerations, I determined that retreating to b3 is, in fact, the right move.} 7. Bb3 Ba6 {Standard development.} 8. d3 {Bert was threatening 8...b4 which would be a nasty discovered attack on my R, in which case, I can defend but would have to waist tempo when time is needed.  Also the Q side is jammed, this time around since 8.Nc3?? is not an option because of 8...dxc3, losing a piece for pawn too early in the game.  So, the idea, as I learned was planning and strategy so that I can develop, whilst preventing him doing damage for the reason outlined.  And, while it might not seem so, the loss of tempo is very damaging, more so then it might seem.} Bd6 {The idea is to develop.} 9. Nd2 {But, now I develop, and I do it based on what I learned from Susan Polgar and also combined with what cplusplus11 recently told me.  For a while, as I've seen in GM games, including the one with Susan which I annotated, last week; instead of bringing the N completely out you develop them closer to the home square.  I mean regularly, so that it's passed the second rank for white and seventh for black, sometimes, there are exceptions to that.  And, one would wonder why.  First, as noted, Nc3?? for the same reason as before wasn't an option.  Second, this is another thing to note about planning and strategy.  When a N is placed like this, it seems a little uncomfortable, but the reality of it, is that you're planning a better outpost for it.  In this case, the short term plan is to get to f3.  The long term plan, which is part of the short term is that, after I can deploy it to that square, I'll be able to develop my last piece, with very little to no loss of tempo.  In addition, as we'll see later, bringing my N to f3 is going to win a pawn, sooner or later, which is also part of my plan.  And, this time, I did without miscalculation because of what I learned from that grandmaster.  This is very important because in the past, even with the person that I don't name or like but still would apply what he said for improvement, some of the time, I'd still have problems thinking ahead without miscalculations.  In fact, that recently happened, up until, I believe it was late May, where in early May this happened, and I lost a piece early.  But, with lessons from Susan, that's no longer happening as things become second nature very quickly, so I learn much sooner.  Without that lesson, it's likely that I'd be panicking, and possibly, making mistakes.} Qc7 {I would've played 9...Nf6 to prepare for 10...0-0  But, as we'll see later, Bert is going to castle on opposite wings.} 10. Nf3 {The very first part of my plan that I mentioned earlier.} Bf4 {You also have to aware of things that might get in the way, as I learned from the same person.  There are things that do get in between these, as is the case here.  And, with it, I felt that best was to exchange.  First, given that I haven't gotten my DSB, whereas, his is on a powerful, I felt that his B was stronger then mine.  So, it'd be to my benefit to exchange.  Second, I'm thinking like a GM, at this point.  Susan Polgar said that you don't need any complex method to think like a grandmaster.  Instead, the key to doing so is finding forced moves, which is what I do here.  Most importantly, as noted, part of the plan behind finding a good outpost for my N was winning a pawn, which now happens after the exchange.  The idea, of course, is that when ahead, it's to your benefit to liquidate pieces.  And, as it turns out, this exchange is, in reality, liquidation since I will a center pawn, which is one of the more important pawn, immediately after.} 11. Bxf4 Qxf4 12. Nxd4 g6 {I don't know what this accomplishes, but I would've played 12...Nf6 here.  I know about getting the basics out of my head, which now I do in extenuating circumstances.  But, I don't see a circumstance that would prevent him from doing that, in this position.} 13. Qf3 {Also optional was to force black to lose tempo by hitting the Q with 13.Ne2  But, the only reason I would've played that was for the thrill of attacking something, which as we know, is not the reason something ought to be attacked.  Therefore, I think I found a much better move, which is why I played this.  The idea being is to liquidate Q's since I'm a pawn up, and that's what will happen, so I'm glad I moved here.} Qxf3 14. Nxf3 Nh6 {! Best, in my opinion.  Personally, I would've played 14...Nf6, but I like this better.  What's going on here?  Well, although not the reason for taking as would be very unsound, I am, coincidentally threatening 15.Ng5, followed by a capture on f7, so as they say, the f7 square.  This time, with his black's decision to play 6.Ba4, Bert's B is, as Jack calls it, "out of play" for the moment, so it cannot defend the square.  But, with this move, however, that changes.  It's because of an overload, in which, black adds a defender to that square.} 15. Rae1 {As we know, another way to control the center is by attacking it, as well.  In general, it's done with the R by moving to the home rank (the rank where they start) and on the center file.  So, this is a perfect example.  Best, was, however, 16.Ng5 because of what's about to happen.} O-O-O {Not surprised that he played this, but I am shocked, however, that he castled on opposite wings.  I have seen it before but not in a position like this.  With that being said, I would've castled short.  But, I think the reason he castled this way is still the pressure that I cause with 16.Ng5, and  15...0-0 would've increased the pressure.} 16. Ng5 {So, I do something, before he can come up with other ideas to prevent me from putting that pressure.  Worth noting that I'm not taking chances since he's a stronger player.  And, with that, I'm trying to play moves that I'd typically see from GM's.  If he were about my rating, lower, or just very slightly higher, it'd be a different story.  But, with a Class A Player, however, I do my best to not take chances of counterplay.} Rdf8 {To my surprise, however, he is able to prevent that pressure.  This is why Ng5, in my opinion, ought to have been played a move earlier.} 17. Re3 {Therefore, before I miss any opportunities, unless he comes up with something, the plan is to double up, so that the R's are on one file.} f6 {But, when he plays this, however, I think about what to do.  I could retreat with 18.Nf3} 18. Rh3 {After some careful considerations, however, I decided to play this.  First, should and when he takes on g5, I take back which continues the liquidation of pieces, as I'm still a pawn up.  Second, but more importantly, I have studied a lot of GM annotations.  In total, it was 9 GM annotations, and I also combined it with annotations from expert charleshiggie.  Of these annotations, all but one did this.  Which is that when the opponent attacks a piece, instead of retreating, you reattack the same piece which I do here.  And, as noted, I'm trying to play like a GM for the reason noted before.  In addition, the other places would lose the N, so the only safe retreat would be 18...Nf3  But, doing so means boxing in my R which I don't want because it means losing the mobility.  And, as I learned from thereaper1 and Jack (when I lost with a blunder that took away the R's mobility) "Mobility is the most important chess aspect."  And, I absolutely agree with this, to large extent.  Maybe not the absolute most important, as there are things like tempii and losing material, but mobility, however, is one of the most important things.} fxg5 19. Rxh6 c5 {I think he's coming up with a way to promote.} 20. a4 {? Up until this point, I don't think I made a single mistake.   But, I'm determined to stop a situation like this.  While I looked at this, no good was 20.d4?? because of 20...c4, in which case, I'd lose a piece since that B is blocked in.  But, I overlooked something.  So, best was 20.c4, and if 20...bxc4, I can answer with 21.cxd4, in which, I'm still a pawn since 21...Bxc4?? isn't an option do to my LSB, as I'd play 22.Bxc4  But, what I anticipated was 20.c4, b4, because it acheives a solid pawn chain.  And, if he played that, I wouldn't know what to do.  But, with this move, however, I thought I knew everything, and was getting pleasure in the position.  However, I went overboard because of what's about happen.  Had I played the right move, black wouldn't have compensated, at least, for now.  } c4 {Although I thought he'd take, this was the other move that I thought he played, so I planned this, as well.  But, unlike before, this time, I miscalculated because, what I didn't know is that I gave him back a pawn, which is something I didn't want to happen.} 21. dxc4 {However, not realizing that I already made a mistake, I played this with the idea of eliminating his pawns.} bxc4 22. Ba2 {Believe it or not, while mentioning variations, I calculated this.  But, that was by playing through variations in those GM annotations and applying them here.  And, that is one reason that playing through variations is good and where it'll help one improve his or her games, especially, against a much stronger player like Bert.} c3 {! As I noted earlier before, I didn't realize the mistake I made before, but this is how 20.a4? won that pawn. } 23. bxc3 {?? Not knowing it, at the time, and thinking that I was still a pawn up I captured here.  Now, it would seem that material wise, things are still even after 23...Bxf1, 24.Kxf1  But, as we know, just because things are level doesn't mean the position is equal.  With that being said, this loses.  The idea being is that, while not right away, after we exchange, black will, eventually, wind up with a passed pawn with no way to stop it.  In part, because Bert will be able to protect those pawns and stop any of my passers with his R.  And, the reason why that other R dosen't count is because it is, as of now, out of play.  So, it proves to be useless for something like this.  After the game, Bert told me that there was no to avoid losing the R.  But, after being my spectator, well although I hate having to disagree with anyone with anyone, I must, regretfully, say that he is wrong.  For, if I did not make this blunder, I wouldn't have lost the R.  So, I'm going by what C++ outlines in his profile which I mentioned in the game with Mariann, which is, "It only takes one bad move to lose a game. So be careful on every move."  I know this, offhand, because in a game that Tom annotated he was up against a master.  And, he was winning with a won position after the master blundered a piece early.  Now, Tom only made one mistake, but it was enough to turn that win into a loss.  That's when he told me that it only takes one mistake to lose, and someone else also told me that when his opponent only made one mistake and lost.  } Bxf1 24. Kxf1 Rf4 {Not surprised that he's going after my center pawn.} 25. f3 {Thinking about what to do, I also considered 25.Be5, but the reason I played this is to try and get a solid pawn chain.  But, unlike my game with Mariann, it doesn't apply here because, as noted, I won't be able to do anything with my pawns.  But, I still like this better, in case, black does what you'd see with GM's.  This time, the plan to centralize his K with 25...Kc7, and then followed by ...Kd6  And, after taking those tests which you know about, I kept in mind that black might attempt that.} Rh4 {This is why my remaining R, as noted earlier, is out of play.  Now, I think about what to do and actually do a lot of HW here.  I see that h2 is attacked don't want to exchange R's, at this point.  Although it appears even, as mentioned, it isn't because black has a winning advantage.  And, I felt that if I exchanged, which will happen later on, he'll be able to use his R to stop my pawn.  But, after further consideration, I determined, that white must exchange, like it or not.  If I don't take, forget about the loss of a pawn.  Instead, Bert will win my remaining R with no way around it or compensation.  So, 26.Rxh4 is indirectly forced, in this position. } 26. Rxh4 gxh4 27. g3 {Thinking about what to do, I advance a pawn.  I also kept in mind that Bert must be careful and not underestimate, as otherwise, I might be able to promote.  While it appears so, this isn't Hope Chess because it's not what I'm hoping for.  I'm sure he won't, but what it boils down to is that I'm doing anything for counterplay, seeing that the position is, more or less, lost.  The idea is not getting nervous and seeing if you can do anything to get out trouble.  Unfortunately it isn't, but thinking the way I do helps me last longer, however.} Rf8 {I thought he'd take on g3, and then even when I took back, the position is still better for black.  However, I'm not surprised that Bert played this, either.  And, it is better then capturing.  That's because he threatens to win a pawn.} 28. f4 {Of course, I won't allow it.} hxg3 {Normally, I would've exchanged, but 28...RXP+ would've been a nasty check for me which I was going to prevent.} 29. hxg3 Kc7 {And, now he starts centralizing his K.  Of course, it's not centralized yet because in order for you to be able to do that, my K would have to be forced on one square which would allow mate.  But, that's his plan.} 30. Bd5 {A small reason for this move was to add an overload to my e pawn and keep a good chain.  One thing I learned is that your B near a pawn like this, can keep a pawn chain.  The main reason was to try and stop his plan from actually being able to centralize my K.  You will note that after the double bishop mate quiz, I was on the other end, and the quiz to see how long you'd be prolong to the mate.  One thing you had to do was get the K in the middle so that he couldn't keep on checking you, until there was mate.  Here, it's not the same as I don't advance the K, but rather, move the B forward.  But, the same thing could be said as it's for the same reason.  So, while can and will advance forward, it will be impossible to confine my K to one square, as of now.  With that being said, I already start to build a little confidence.  But, it's not confidence of counterplay, but just that, I can last a little longer.  And, this time, my instincts are wrong since there's still a way to go before I resign.} Kd6 {With what I mentioned before, this is the move that I anticipated and took right into calculation, without miscalculating, as I'm pretty sure, he'd keep advancing closer to my K and towards the center which is completing centralization, had I not played 30.Bd5} 31. c4 {So, now, I'm adding my own overload to the B since he might try to foil my plans with the R.  It wouldn't happen now, but this might be his long term plans, so I stop it, in case my instincts are right and that's what Bert has in mind.} Kc5 {Black has other ideas, so this is something that I overlooked in part of my plans.  So, I really start thinking about what to do next.  As noted, because I'm up against a much stronger player, I'm trying to play, especially with this position, like a GM.} 32. e5 {So, it starts here, also bearing me in mind that black must be careful not to underestimate me.  For if he does, that pawn will continue advance because, if he doesn't find the right move, that will become a passer and I'll be able to promote.  Since I felt that the position was lost, as is, with nothing else to lose, this is where I start doing Hope Chess, doing anything for counterplay.  This is aside from resigning, which we all agree would be premature, or getting so nervous that I start making mistakes.  By playing, this, however, I gain confidence.  But, it won't last long.} Kd4 {So, my instincts were right.  His goal is to force my K to one square.} 33. Ke2 {Knowing that and remembering what happened on the other end, seeing how long I'd be able last against being mated by both bishops and making mistakes, this time, I stop his long term plans, as now, Bert can't advance his K further, unless he plays, 34.Kc3  But, even so, my K won't be confined to only one square.  With that being said, I also retained, in addition to that quiz, what shamash said.  "It's not about how much you learn, but rather, applying what you learn and using it towards your game."  Without that advice, I would've forgotten about that quiz as well, and as a result, missed something like this. } Rb8 {While I last longer, as a result, the move played does not bail me out of trouble.  In fact, nothing will as Bert has a win, in this position.  But, it will take longer.} 34. Kd2 {Keeping this in mind, I play this before black can get the opposition and increase his advantages even further.} Rb2 {He wants my a pawn.  Now, I'm going to see what I can do.} 35. a5 {I try to stall his plan with this move.  But, I quickly see that it's of no use because there's no way I can stop him from taking there.} Ra2 36. g4 {Believe it or not, I, originally, played 36.c3+  But, I forgot something very important being that this is an illegal move.  I did something similar when taking a quiz as black to see how long you could last, and during that quiz I mentioned a similar move, and he said something that you'd typically hear of a teacher saying, "Do you think that's a legal move?"  When I looked at it, I realized that it wasn't.  Well, the same thing applies here so when I checked, Bert accurately said something that someone told me when I was learning the game like where the pieces could move, etc, by saying, "You can't do that."  This was the only game chat, and likewise he's right because I overlooked that the c pawn is pinned.  Having said, that, I play this because the plan which I forgot was illegal still remains.  With that being said, I also want to see what he's going to do because if black is not careful, I can get counterplay.  In this case, a swindle, with one of my pawn.  And, although they're not passed pawns, I beared in mind from previous that it doesn't take a passer for a pawn to be dangerous.} Rxa5 {This is where I felt that black became overly confident.  Later on, however, I discovered that I was wrong.  But, here my optimisim increased as I felt that I can pull a swindle.  Of course, as we headed later on, I realized that it isn't true.  In a case like this, however, I'm glad to be wrong because gaining that confidence which is what I try for my students does prevent me from resigning which I still wouldn't here, or make worse mistakes.  And, making the position would've, however, occurred, if I didn't gain any confidence.} 37. c3+ {So, I finally play it.  And, using memory techniques from my games against Jack, I kept in mind that a check like this could be quite nasty.  Now, I have, one occasion pulled a swindle against my coach by doing this.  But, as we'll see, and not surprisingly, the plan will not work. } Kc5 {But, as noted, there's not chance of counterplay which is how it's supposed to be since you learn more from games that you lose.  In addition, with this move, this position is just like how it was before the check.} 38. Kd3 {?! To try and prevent any more damage, I play this.  But, it's an inaccuracy because it loses tempo with the next move.  This time, tempo is very much needed due to the situation that I'm in.} Ra1 39. Kd2 {To prevent him from checking me on d1, I respond here with the same idea.  However, he could've played 39.Ra2+, and I was prepared.  For, if he played that, I would just move back to d1, with the idea that he'd keep checking me, and I'd make the same move back and forth, until the game ends in a draw by repetition.} Rg1 {First, Bert will not allow that since he is a much stronger player.  But, he also has other ideas.  Black wants my g pawn.} 40. g5 {So, I have to protect.} Rg3 {I don't know why he played this.  As black, I would've played 40...Rg4 which would've won another pawn.} 41. Kc2 {So, I go here with the idea being to try and get him to lose more tempo since things won't be as easy.  Not a good thought process as the idea since I'm lost is more Hope Chess since I felt that I had nothing else to lose.  The idea is that in that situation you might as well as Jack once implied when I was going to mate him, no matter what he did.  So, he took and said that he might as well have taken since I'd mate, one or another.  The reason is that he had no good moves left, one way or another which is exactly how I felt here.} Rh3 {Like before, I have no idea what this move accomplishes.} 42. Kb3 {But, the reason I moved is for the same reason that I played 41.Kc2} Rh4 {And, now he's going to win my f pawn, no matter what I do.} 43. e6 {But, this is where I felt that he became overly confident.  I initially felt that I'd be able to promote, if black doesn't find the right move, which I'm sure he will.  But, by playing his last move I anticipated he'd take, which Bert does, but then I take back, and suddenly, I felt that I was slightly better despite winning a pawn after 44...Rxf4.  It isn't because not only does he win a pawn, but there's another move that I overlooked.} dxe6 44. Bxe6 Rxf4 45. Bd5 {This is why I thought I was a little better then earlier.  The reason being are those doubled pawns which are now passed pawns.  And, it's where I kept in mind that doubled pawns can be beneficial if one could promote, and I also kept in mind that I had my LSB, at this point, defending both of them.  But, I overlooked the fact that his K, effectively, blocks both of my passers which is another reason that there's no hope left for white, at this point.} Rg4 46. Bg8 {Without any miscalculation, as I remembered what Susan said.  The idea being that the key to thinking like a GM is finding forced moves.  So, with that in mind, I calculated that if he takes, I will grab his h pawn, and then we wind up with an exchange.  This does wind up happening.  And, I thought it would delay the loss, but this time, I'm not going to last much longer, unfortunately.  } Rxg5 47. Bxh7 Rg1 {The reason is because of this move.  I kept in mind that if the R came off of the g file, I would get the pawn.  But, this wasn't hope chess, anymore, because I knew, for a fact, that a strong player like him wouldn't give up that pawn.  I just didn't know what he'd play, but this is really ugly because with his R, all the way down like this, Bert will just keep advancing, and when the pawn gets down far enough he can move the R.  In which case, black will be able promote with no way to stop it.  With that in mind, I'm almost ready to resign but will still see, what I can do, first.} 48. Bg8 Rg2 {Still giving protection to the pawn.  But seeing that he played this, as opposed to 48...g5 I'm not ready to resign, yet.  If, however, he had and does decide to advance his pawn a square further, that's when I'll resign.} 49. Bd5 {Prolonging the game by only one move.  So, I start going to on the offense.  I'm back to hope chess, though, since I'm just hoping that he gets the R off the file so I can get his knob.  This time, it happens.  } Rf2 50. Be4 {So, now, I go for his pawn.} g5 {Not to my surprise, at all, he plays this.  I resign because I cannot stop the g pawn do to his R.  And, Bert is going to promote, no matter what I do.  In addition, mate will, eventually, come after he promotes.  I know because, as HW, I've had to study similar mating sequences with Jack.  In a situation like this, when you have a R, and the pawn promotes, the opponent can soon deliver check.  Unlike before, it keeps on happening until he or she mates.  The moral that Bert gave which I know is true as Jack taught me is that you have to be aware of passed pawns as they are very dangerous.  What's implied is that if you're not you'll lose because he or she will be able to promote with no way to prevent it.}
