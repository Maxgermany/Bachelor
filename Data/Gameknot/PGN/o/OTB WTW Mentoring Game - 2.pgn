[Opening "QGD Slav defence, Alekhine variation (D10)"]

1. d4 {Just like with 1.e4 openings, this is how Jack also opens.  So, I'll stick to my usual.  Now, I know him, and with it he'll play the QG, in which, I'll decline with the Slav Defense.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 {I was a little surprised to see this played now, as I had expected 3.Nf3  But, I have learned to expect the unexpected.  Might not be the right approach, but the idea is not to be taken off guard by things that you're not used to because as Ken taught, openings can be intense.} Nf6 {With that being, I stick with what I'm used.  As I'm holding off on developing my Nb8 because of the general guidelines on that N in QPO, being that I might be able to use the c pawn at a later time.} 4. Bg5 {Trying to put pressure on me.  To my knowing and concern it didn't work because it's not pinned.  } g6 {?! Thus, finding it a nuicense and ignoring the pressure, I decide to fianchetto my Bf8 at once by not thinking about anything else.  In other words, nothing else came into consideration.  But, this is an inaccuracy because will get a favorable exchange which puts me at a disadvantage.  For one thing, he is exchanging, my N for his B.  As with most position, the N is, in general, more favorable, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  In fact, that's why when I asked her about exchanges, she said that as a general rule, you should exchange the N for B.  And, she also stressed it in the mega bundle course that I purchased which is, "Polgar University 2017."  This is everything that she is covering in the university where she is teaching chess.  So, by ignoring what's occurring, Jack will be able to get the exchange that Susan has mentioned.  Second, in the process, Mr. Stockel will be able to double up my pawns.  And, what's worse is that I'll be forced to recapture away from the center which is another benefit for white.  Better was to self impose the pin by advancing my e pawn, but then, Jack would still get the beneficial exchange.  Therefore, best was to retreat my Nf6.} 5. Bxf6 exf6 6. cxd5 {I don't mind this exchange as much, but I think that it still benefits Jack.} cxd5 7. e3 {As now, Jack not only has a good line for his Bf1, but in the process, this move gives him a solid pawn chain.} Bb4 {Doing what I can to put a stop to it, I continued my development with the decision of pinning his Nc3.  And, it's a method of trying to figure out other options, in this position.} 8. Qa4+ {Not surprisingly, Jack places me in check.} Nc6 {And, I interpose with my other N to leave the option of castling open.} 9. Bb5 {However, I overlooked this move since, similarly, my Nc6 is pinned.  But, I've got an answer to that.} Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 {I'm still not completely but am feeling more comfortable about my position due to his a pawn being cut off from the rest of his pawns.  In other words, we're talking about an isolated pawn.} Bd7 {With that, I add an extra defender to my Nc6 by breaking the pin.  Afterall, if something is attacked twice, as I learned in a very lucky draw it's trouble, especially when one of the attackers is what the defended piece is pinned to.} 11. Ne2 {I was surprised to see Jack develop this way.  In this position, I had expected to see 11.Nf3 where the N appears a little better.  With that, I'm going to castle next with the idea of freeing up my Nc6.  However, I did not spend enough time to think about Jack's next exchange since it will, once again involve my N for B.  As noted, this is going to be beneficial.  Better was to delay it even longer with 11...Nb8.  And, now, if Jack is to exchange, it would be my B for his N which wouldn't be as bad, and in fact, for the reasons noted earlier, may even be beneficial for black.} O-O 12. Bxc6 Bxc6 13. Qc2 Bb5 {After attacking the Q, I now prepare to exchange Jack's Ne2.  The only reason is for the idea of taking away Jack's right to castle which for me is a good enough reason.  However, my assessment was wrong, as we're about to see.  Even though I accurately anticipate what's to happen, Jack will overlook a better move which would've increased his advantage.} 14. h4 Bxe2 15. Kxe2 {As noted, this was the only reason that I exchanged on e2.  But, Jack would've maintained castling and would've increased his advantage with 15.Qxe2.  With this capture, he's given a little.  And, with that, this is where I feel comfortable about my position, whereas, I wasn't comfortable before Jack captured with his K.  And, that's because my K is now safer then his monarch.} Qd7 {With that being said, I connect my Rooks and prepare to check on g4 with a plan behind it.  And, these plans which turn out accurate is where I'm not comfortable but begin to feel happy about my position.  In fact, I almost smiled here.} 16. Rag1 {Jack intends to double up which is why he played.  But, nothing stops me from checking on g4, at this point.} Qg4+ 17. f3 {Believe it or not, I saw this move coming and am not bothered by it, at all.  As I am still very comfortable with my position.  And, this is not going to change, even after the decisive mistake.} Qd7 18. h5 {Advancing his pawn, as 19.hxg6 is a conditional move.  As, I'm not only ready but am more then happy to exchange here, as we're bound to see.} Rfe8 19. hxg6 fxg6 {And, the reason being is that this allowed me to reconnect my pawns.  With that being said, I go now from comfortable to feeling very happy about my position and actually should be.  The reason being is that only one desicive mistake was made but not here.  And, with best play, in this position, the game should end in a draw, as Jack pointed out.  Believe it or not, that's how I'm thinking now as I am confident about the possibility about getting a draw.  In other words, that is my thought process starting now, and because of what Mr. Stockel said later on, I am correct here.  Of course, I know not to trust to your opponent, but it's a question of when he's right or not.  With this game, due to my thought process, I reckon that he's right.  In fact, my belief is that he is spot on.} 20. Rh3 {But, here comes a dangerous plan which I'm bound to overlook.  The plan is to double.  But, as usual, two rooks on one file can be very dangerous, as it will be here.} Qe6 {I threaten a mate which I know that won't miss.  But, I'm thinking about something that Ken has taught me.  So, the question is, what happens after 21.Qd3} 21. Qd3 Qb6 {The answer is this move, as I plan to check on b2.} 22. Rgh1 {And, this was the conditional move because, as noted, he has doubled up.  Therefore, it allows me to check.  I'm not doing for the thrills and giggles on this move.  But, rather, I want to see if the glaucoma will play a role.  For if it does, and he doesn't interpose, I can win his g2 pawn.  However, Jack sees right through that and sure enough interposes.} Qb2+ 23. Qd2 Qb5+ {Therefore, I check in hopes that he'll block with his c4 pawn.  Once again, that hope is based on the glaucoma as then, I'd pick up a pawn that way.  But, as anticipated, Jack doesn't give it up.} 24. Kf2 Re6 {?? Just like with what Jack has done, my goal was to double up in such a way that one of my Rooks is not cramped.  So, it's also about a good outpost, but this was the decisive mistake as Jack pointed.  As now, not only will he win a pawn, but this will give him a mating net that I overlooked.  After the game, we went over variations.  He said that my only options were 24...Re7, 24...Qd7.  Of those two, I like 24...Re7 the best because it allows me to double up with a later ...Re8.  Perhaps, even on the next move.  The point is that one of the major pieces had to be on the 7th rank to keep my P and K protected.  By playing this it's over.  So, after the game was over, we played through some variations right after 24.Kf2.  It involved black playing 24...Re7.  Yes, there was one mistake much later that lost with his passed pawn.  But, this is where my instincts (thought process) was verified.  For after, 24.Kf2, Re7, or 24...Qd7 if black plays everything accurately, it's, at the very least, a draw.  And, if white makes one error, black would, in fact, be able to win.  Of course, Jack wouldn't have made it, but I did have the opportunity to draw the game up until now.  But, that also shows that unlike some previous games, I had a very good reason to be happy about my position.  But, this blunder, it's game over, at once starting with his next move.  } 25. Rh3xh7 Rae8 {Feeling like I've achieved my goal, I double up and threaten to take on e3.  However, it's irrelevant because of what's about to unfold.} 26. Rh7h8+ Kf7 {Thinking that it was safe, I played this to protect my Rook.  Jack: Aren't you missing something.  Joe: I don't think so.  But, then he showed me his next move which is, indeed, checkmate.  And, that's when we went reviewed why on my 24th move, it was necessary to keep my R or Q on the seventh.  As it is the same rank where he got my pawn, and later the King.  As it turns out, one them would've guarded against what unraveled.  And, that became one of the main teaching lessons since we spent about 30 minutes studying what happens after 24...Re7 before starting the next game which I also lost with a back rank mate.  That's when he later reemphasized how important King Safety is.  And, there was, I believe, a 15 minute lesson before we had to pack up and leave.} 27. Rh1h7# {}
