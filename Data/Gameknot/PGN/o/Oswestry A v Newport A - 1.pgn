1. f4 {This was a very lucky win by me!} d5 {As far as I can remember, this was the third game between us. I won the first, he won the second and I won this, the third,} 2. Nf3 {For him, this is relatively normal. He sometimes opens with 1. b3 or 1. b4.} g6 {I decide to fianchetto my bishop.} 3. e3 {He prepares to develop his.} Bg7 {I complete the fianchetto} 4. Be2 {He develops his.} Nc6 {With a "threat" of e7-e5.} 5. d4 {Which he stops.} Nh6 {With a plan of f7-f6, Nf7 and e7-e5 in due course, but it is far too slow and white can always hit the black centre with c2-c4. Simply Nf6 is better.} 6. h4 {And this is a mistake.} Bg4 {Now my bishop can't be attacked by h2-h3} 7. c4 {He attacks my centre.} e6 {I defend.} 8. Nc3 {He attacks again.} Qd7 {I prepare to castle.} 9. cxd5 {He takes.} exd5 {I take back.} 10. Qb3 {Attacking d5 and b7} O-O-O {Protecting both.} 11. Na4 {Threat 12. Na4-c5} Bf8 {To stop the knight. I wasn't sure of this move at the time, but Fritz thinks it best and gives advantage of 0.44 to black.} 12. Bd2 {He develops his bishop at last.} Nf5 {Fritz also likes this move.} 13. Bb5 {I should have played Bxf3 here, but I changed by mind and played....} Qe6 14. Bxc6 {Clever move. If I take back with the queen, he has 14. Ne5 Qe6 15. Nxg4. That is not the end of the story - I can then play 15....Ng3 attacking both Rh1 and Ng4, but he has 16. Nf2 meeting 16....Nxh1 with 17. Nxh1 and he has two minor pieces for the rook. I think I can then pick up a pawn, starting with 17....Qg4, but I think in the long run the two minor pieces are better than rook and pawn - besides I am losing my best pieces... Any views dear reader?} bxc6 {So I took this way.} 15. Ne5 {Attacking my bishop.} Ng3 {Defending and attacking.} 16. Nd3 {Great move! Now the threat is Nc5 attacking both my queen and threatening mate.} Re8 {Giving a flight square to my king, and also in some variations the rook action down the e file is crucial.} 17. Nac5 {So the knight comes in.} Bxc5 {I take.} 18. Nxc5 {He takes back.} Qd6 {Now I am threatening both the rook on h1 and the pawn on f4, due to the pin on the e file by my rook.} 19. Kf2 {So I have the chance to win the exchange with 19...Nxh1+ 20. Rxh1. But then what? It is hard for me to untangle my pieces. I eventually decided not to take the rook. I was glad when I annotated this, and found that Fritz at first favours 19.....Nxh1 but eventually after thinking for several minutes decides on the move I played....} Ne4+ {This move.} 20. Nxe4 {He takes.} Rxe4 {I take back.} 21. Rac1 {He starts ganging up on my queen side weaknesses.} h5 {Played to prevent his h pawn advancing. Frizt prefers 21...h6. I was hoping for 22. Bb4? Rxf4!+ with advantage, but he is awake to that.} 22. Rc5 {He starts to double rooks on the c file.} f6 {I need to break through on the king side.} 23. Rhc1 {Threatening c6} Bd7 {So my bishop comes back to protect.} 24. Qd3 {The queen is about to come in with deadly effect. Fritz now likes 24....Kd8 now with plus 2 to white. What I played is probably the best practical chance.} g5 {This advance.} 25. Qa6+ {He throws in a check.} Kd8 {Of course my king is a sitting duck if it stays on the queen-side. Plus 4.25 to white now, according to Fritz.} 26. Rc5xc6 {A fairly obvious exchange sacrifice.} Bxc6 {I take.} 27. Rxc6 {He takes back.} Qe7 {Fritz prefers Qd7, but it is a bit academic, objectively black is lost.} 28. Ba5 gxf4 {The best chance. My opponent, not 100% sure that taking on c7 led to a won ending, decided to make everything safe by playing....} 29. exf4 {Oops!} Rxf4+ {White resigns, it is mate in 2. https://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=218519 Many thanks for reading.
