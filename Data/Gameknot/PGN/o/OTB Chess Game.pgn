[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Lipnitzky attack"]

1. e4 {Jack usually starts off with the QPO (1.d4), but he started off this way, on Friday.} c5 {Of course, I start off with the Sicilian.  And, when that happens, he goes into the Open Variation which allows me to play the Nadjorf, as I'm most comfortable and used to it.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bc4 {Of course, I get stuck here, but this is the main continuation.  But, I try something different which I don't think has been analyzed before.  As I go right after his B.  Of course, the idea is chasing it, so that, I have time to develop another piece which is about to happen.} b5 7. Bb3 g6 {I do this with a fianchetto.  I had also considered 7...e6 but decided against it, as my B would only cover one square.  Once I complete my fianchetto, however, it'll cover 2, and I'll be ready to do something with my Nf6, at a later point in time, which will allow it to cover 4 squares.} 8. a3 {I don't see the point of this move.  I'd understand if ...Nb4 or ...Bb4 were an option.  But, they're not, and this doesn't help with Jack's development.  He is getting a semi open file for the R, but as far as, I'm concerned, it's premature.  As the R is of no use now, until his Bc1 is developed.} Bg7 {So, I take advantage of that by completing the fianchetto.} 9. Nf3 {In contrast, I see the point behind this.  As I was about to unleash a masked battery.  If Jack hadn't played this, I would've attacked and captured with 9...Nxe4, being that after 10.Nxe4, I'd liquidate with 10...Bxe4  Keeping this in mind, Jack plays this to protect e4.} Bg4 {And, I respond by pinning.  Of course, I'm ready for Jack's next move.} 10. h3 Bxf3 {?! And, I answer by exchanging.  In general, I'm not ready at this point and refrain from exchanging.  As the idea is to not exchange just because one can.  But, the reason for doing so here was because I thought that e4 was attacked again.  However, this is a wrong assessment, and I had an episode of Ghost Vision here.  As I got my own color mixed up with Jack's color.  With that being said, I thought after 11.Qxf3, I had extra protection on e4 and was ready to do more damage.  That's true, but with Jack instead.  So, exchanging was not the way to go here.  Better was 10...Bd7, where I still have the option of developing my Nb8.} 11. Qxf3 O-O {Knowing what I just did and figuring out that it was caused by Ghost Vision, I try to correct the inaccuracy on my previous move by castling, at once.} 12. Bg5 {Of course, Jack responds by trying to put pressure on my Nf6.} Qa5 {And, that's when I decide to pin his Nc3.  The idea now is to attack twice, as I'm now threatening 13...Nfd7 which would've targeted his b2 pawn.} 13. O-O {But, Jack has none of that and answers by castling.} h6 {So, I go for something else with this attack.  I didn't like his Bg5 where it was and decided to get it out of there.} 14. Bd2 Nbd7 {So, I ask myself what next and try to work on a different variation by completing my development.  Of course, I had also considered 14...Nc6, with the idea of 15...Nd4 which forks.  Well, I would've played, but it was then about what comes between those lines that could make it fail.  And, I realized that after 14...Nc6, Jack would, more then likely, answer with 15.Nb1 which attacks my Q, first.  He could still do it now, but the N looks more passive and less dangerous.  When that happens, Jack usually holds off on the attack which is the case here.  Whereas, he wouldn't have, if I had developed this to c6, instead.} 15. Rab1 {So, he plays this.  I don't see the point since the pawn isn't attacked.  I either would've attacked with 15.Nb1 or centralized this R to d1, so I'm alluding to 15.Rad1.} Nc5 {Trying to take advantage of what I consider to a pointless move, I went on the attack with this move.  The first thing that I'm keeping in mind is that Jack can't attack with 16.Nb1 since his R is on that square.  So, I'm, more or less, trying to ask him if he'd like to exchange or where he wants to with his Bb3, as GM Susan Polgar puts it.  You'll be shocked to find out that Jack misses that question and is about to blunder.} 16. Rfd1 {Instead, he centralizes this R.  I would've retreated with 16.Ba2, as now I'm about to take.} Nxb3 17. Be1 {?? But, this is where Jack makes the mistake.  Of course, 17.cxb3 was needed.  By playing this, I will protect my N which will leave me a piece up.  I think that the glaucoma got to him, as he probably thought that this was the attacked the N.  Once in a while, he asks if this is a N, B, P.  Thing is that he is forced to do some blindfolded chess because of it which, sometimes, leads to a mistake or miscalculation.} Nc5 18. Nd5 {At first, I wasn't sure why Jack played this.  My thinking was that he'd like to exchange my N which I was ready for.  Afterall, his N is stronger then my Nf6, so I was ready to allow it.  But, it turns out that he was after my e7 pawn.} Qa4 {?? Having said that, I decided to go after his c2 pawn.  But, I overlooked something and this ought to win a R for N would, pretty much, allow him to equalize for lost material.  Best was to attack with 18...e6.} 19. Nxe7+ {? As he plays this.  In most situations, this would be the best move.  But, I left myself vulnerable to something more which I didn't realize.  So, his best move was 19.Nb6! forking R+N.  Even after something like 19...Qa5 20.Nxa8 Rxa8, despite me being up the equivalent to a pawn, I think that Jack would be a little better off.  And, with this move, I can and will recapture.} Kh8 20. Qe2 Nfxe4 {That happens right here.  I also considered using the other N (capturing with 20...Ncxe4), but I took this way, as now, my Bf7 is covering more squares.} 21. f3 {I expected Jack to attack this way, as now I can and will throw in a check.} Bd4+ {I also could've threatened to liquidate with 21...Bf6, but I was trying to figure out what kind of attack I could launch, against his K, with my pieces working together like this.} 22. Kh1 Ng5 {But, this is where I figured out that I don't have much of an attack, at all and pulled back.  In fact, I miscalculated because Jack is going to get a pawn starting with his next move, as my B will be attacked.  For that reason, 23.c3 is bound to become a masked battery which I didn't realize, when he first played it.} 23. c3 Bg7 24. Rxd6 {I only discovered it here since this move was overlooked.} Rfe8 {Knowing what just happened, I decide to tie down Jack's N.  A while back, someone gave me advice to not, voluntarily, tie down your own pieces.  Without realizing it, Jack just did that.  And, ION recently mentioned that when you can, you should tie down your pieces.  Well, that's the case with this position since his Ne7 is indirectly pinned.  Of course, I can't take, but I like where I'm standing, as of the moment.} 25. Qe3 {But, Jack tries to get out of this by attacking my Nc5.  Of course, I could go on the offense, as 25...Nb7 came into consideration.} Bf8 {But, I played this since this attacks his Ne7.  By doing things this way, 26.Qxc5 will allow me to liquidate.  And, in the aftermath, I'll have a very similar pin to what Grace had with, "Bonnie" when she won, in that final position.  } 26. Qxc5 Bxe7 {The only difference is that, instead of the K, Jack's R is indirectly pinned to his Q.  Nontheless, I thought that this would lead to the same thing, win of serious material.  Had that happened the position would be resignable for white.  } 27. Qd4+ {But, I overlooked this move as Jack defended with this intermediate check.  I asked myself what to do here.  I considered 27...Kg1?? which I ruled out of court since he has 28.Qxa4, which, during the game, I thought would win the Q.  I also looked at 27...Kh2 which would've led to the same thing, only to later realize that my Q was, afterall, protected.  So, after giving it thought, I thought that taking on d4 was my only option, but I am satisfied with this since it results in further liquidation.  } Qxd4 28. Rxd4 Bf6 {In the aftermath, I go right after his R.  And, when Jack defends, I prepare to double up on one file starting with 29...Re2.} 29. Rd5 Re2 30. Kg1 {Preparing to defend and even attack one of my R's, but this will allow me to double up with my next move.} Rae8 31. Kf1 {This is a conditional move because it's the only way for Jack to prevent further loss of material.} Rc2 {But, I was ready for this, as I prepare to double my R's on the same rank.  Yep, the plan behind this is to allow 32...R8e2.} 32. Rd2 {But, with this move, I'll do something else, liquidate his Rd2, instead.} Rxd2 33. Bxd2 Rd8 {And, that's when I hit his B.} 34. Be3 {Not sure how he winded up with this, Jack asked this question, "When did you win a piece."  I responded by saying, That's when I took, and you didn't recapture.  What I was implying was right after 16...Nxb3, when he played 17.Be1??, as opposed to 17.cxb3.  What I forgot to mention is that Jack could've won back material, had he forked with 19.Nb6, as opposed to, capturing with 19.Nxe7+?  Right after I answered his question, Jack implied that he really had to struggle and think about how he could convert the advantage back to him.} Rd3 {And, I attack, again.} 35. Ke2 {I was prepared for Jack to retreat.  But, I like this better, as using the K is useful.  I would've defended with 35.Kf2, instead.  However, I think that Jack played the best move as this centralizes his monarch since it's now in the center.  And, it counterattacks.} Rd5 36. Ra1 {So, he prepares to add another defender to one of his pawns.  As 36.a4? would be a mistake because of the, "timing" issue, as Ken puts it.  That is that one move can make a big difference, as it would here.} Ne6 {This is where I start losing concentration, as Master Nathan A Resika just showed up.  And, Jack just informed me that we're gonna have to adjourn this game, in order to give Nathan a chance to play.  It turns out that we will have a simultaneous match against him.} 37. a4 {Of course, Jack was prepared to play this move.} bxa4 {? But, this is where I misjudge and make an inaccurate assessment.  Of course, I now have doubled pawns but figured that this move would allow one of the two passed pawns to break through.  Once we adjourned, Nathan pointed out that, even though I'm still winning, this was not the way due to what happens after 38.Rxa4.  Stronger was 37...Nc5! which almost guarantees an instant win.  The first thing I kept in mind is that 38.Bxc5 would allow me to liquidate, yet, that move is almost forced to prevent my pawns from breaking through and promoting.  And, had it not been for me having to finish this game with Jack, I would've brought the N to c5.  But, when something like this, and I'm going through a sudden change, like here, that's when I wind up making mistakes. } 38. Rxa4 a5 {To stop the pawn from advancing further, I play this.  And, right after this move, Nathan takes over.  Jack gave him and I the option of continuing this game and see what the Master would do.  But, we both decided to start a new game.  Given that black doesn't have an immediate win and that Jack didn't resign, this will just remain as an unfinished game, or still in progress because we don't go back to resume what we finished.  However, I will either have to play Tom Walsh or Carl for my third tournament game next week.  And, I'll annotate it, when that happens.    }
