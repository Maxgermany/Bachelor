1. e4 {My first non-loss of the League season ...  Any suggestions of better alternative lines gratefully received.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bc4 {As played by Short vs Kasparov.  I have long favoured this variation but it is very difficult to get it right.  I also play the other standard moves 6. Bg5 and 6.Be3. } b5 {Interesting .... Normal is 6...e6.  Hendrik explained that this has the advantage of preventing White from answering 6...e6 with 7.a4, which is not a move I've contemplated before.  As played, we trasnpose to the normal line anyway. } 7. Bb3 e6 8. f4 {White attacks the centre without delay.  I find I'm slightly more successful with this than with immediate castling.  The difficulty with this opening is getting the move order right to gain the initiative without leaving oneself open to devastating counters.  This move, for example, leaves the a7-g1 diagonal very weak. } Be7 9. Be3 {Possibly a wasted move as the B soon has to move again.  This move does prepare the possibility of Q-side castling and appears to reduce the exposure on the a7-g1 diagonal, but in some variations the B itself becomes a liability as it is unprotected.  The Nd4 can become pinned against it. } O-O 10. O-O Bb7 {After the game, Hendrik suggested that 10 ... Nbd7 was better, possibly followed by ...Nc5.  The move played immediately puts the question to White's e-pawn, which is hard to defend. } 11. e5 {The pawn evades the attack and, in turn, attacks Black's N.  The main alternative would have been 11. Qf3 but this ties the Q to the e-pawn's defence and pins the pawn against the Q, reducing its scope for involvement in attack. } dxe5 {Hendrik's dilemma was whether to play this swap or just to retreat the N immediately, thereby attacking the e-pawn.  We looked at that option afterwards but came to no firm conclusion. } 12. fxe5 Nfd7 13. Nf3 {I also considered 13. Qh5 but after 13. ...g6 the Q would have had to move again and the e-pawn would have been lost. } Nc6 {This natural move threatens to win the e-pawn. } 14. Bf4 {As noted earlier, the B now has to move again to defend the e-pawn, which has become a bit of a liability and is the focal point of the game at this stage. } Qb6+ {So Black takes the opportunity to exploit the vacated diagonal. } 15. Kh1 Rfd8 {Good idea poorly executed: the wrong rook! } 16. Qe2 {The Q avoids the threatened discovered attack and bolsters the defence of the e-pawn. } Nc5 {As the attack on e5 is getting nowhere, Black changes focus, threatening to swap for White's long-term asset, the WSB, and also opening up the d-file for his rook. } 17. Be3 {Back pops the B to pin the N against Black's Q.  The e-pawn is no longer the focus, which has shifted to the Q-side, where Black is poised to counter-attack } Qc7 {Black relieves the pin and renews the attack on the e-pawn } 18. Qf2 {I was rather proud of this move, exploiting the half-open f-file and attacking the Nc5.  If Black takes the e-pawn with his N, White retakes and has a dangerous attack on f7, so, if Black recaptures on f5, White penetrates deep into Black's position on f7, with plentiful attacking options.. } Nxb3 {Black completes his mission to remove the WSB, also giving White doubled pawns, a long-term liability. } 19. axb3 {I also contemplated cxb3 so that I wouldn't have to defend the c2 pawn, which was already vulnerable to a revealed attack by Black's Q, pinning my N to c3. However, I decided that it was more important to follow the old adage of capturing towards the centre, allowing my c-pawn to contest control of the d3 square.  The move I should have considered in more detail than I did was 19. Bb6!?, skewering Q and R.  Would Black then have taken on a1 or moved the Q? } Rdf8 {Black's move implicitly acknowledges the error on move 15, avoiding the skewer and defending f7. } 20. Rad1 {Now White occupies the open d-file, which Black must be chary of contesting because of the aforementioned skewer. } Nb4 {So instead he attacks the vulnerable c-pawn, while also revealing the power of the Bb7.  It would have been dangerous to take on e5 as White would have been able to pin the N with 21. Bf4 and pile up pressure with 22. Rfe1. } 21. Bb6 {A wasted move that allows Black to set up his own mating threat (still remote but it ties White's pieces up). } Qc6 {Of course ... } 22. Be3 {White has effectively just given Black a free move to apply pressure to White's king. } Rac8 {Black increases the pressure on the c-file.  He could have contested the d-file but presumably did not want to swap rooks or have to retreat his B to d8 to recapture. } 23. Qg3 {Belatedly, White initiates a kingside attack.  This would have been much stronger two moves ago.  White is not concerned by 23...Nxc2, since the B will evade attack by threatening mate: 24. Bh6 } Kh8 {Black neatly sidesteps the threat. Alternative variation: 23... Nxc2 24. Bh6 g6 25. Bxf8 Ne3 ( 25... Bxf8 26. Rd3 ) 26. Bxe7 Nxf1 27. Qh4  } 24. Bg5 f6 25. exf6 gxf6 26. Ne5 {Despite extensive post-game analysis, we couldn't refute this surprising thrust.  Unfortunately I can't remember all the variations but 26 ...Qc5 was the most challenging.  We decided in the end that Black had found the best response but some of the variations I've looked at since perhaps suggest otherwise. } Qxg2+ {Alternative variation: 26... fxe5 27. Bxe7 ( 27. Qxe5+ Kg8 28. Qg3 Bxg5 29. Qxg5+ Kh8 30. Rxf8+ Rxf8 31. Rd8 Rxd8 32. Qxd8+ Kg7 33. Qg5+ [If Black can escape the checks, he surely wins.] ) 27... Rxf1+ 28. Rxf1 Rg8 29. Rf8 Rxf8 30. Bxf8 Qc7 31. Qg5 ( 31. Bxb4 [looks better] 31... Qf7 32. h3 ) 31... Qf7 [Black wins] 32. h3 Qxf8 33. Qxe5+ Qg7 34. Qxe6?? ( 34. Qxg7+ Kxg7 35. Ne2 Nxc2 36. Nf4 e5 37. Ne6+ Kf6 38. Nc5 Bc8 ( 38... Bd5 39. Nxa6 Ne3 ) ) 34... Qxg2#  Alternative variation: 26... Qc5 27. Bxf6+ Bxf6 28. Nd7 Rg8 29. Qxg8+ Rxg8 30. Nxc5 Bxg2+ 31. Kg1 Bxf1+ 32. Kxf1 [Material's even but White's pawns look worse.]  } 27. Qxg2 {Forced. } Bxg2+ 28. Kxg2 fxg5 29. Rd7 Rxf1 30. Kxf1 Rf8+ 31. Ke2 Bf6 32. Nf7+ Kg8 33. Nh6+ Kh8 34. Nf7+ {Seeing that my pawns were worse and that my attack had failed to give me a conclusive attack, I offered the draw.  For Black to avoid the perpetual, he would have to give up material, so he accepted: the only way to avoid repetition would have been to play 34....Kg7, when 35. Nxg5+ wins back a pawn but Black still has counter-chances. }
