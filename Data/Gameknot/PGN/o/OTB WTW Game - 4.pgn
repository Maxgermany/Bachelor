1. e4 {With Jack Stockel, though, I have a difficult time figuring out if he'll play 1.d4, or 1.e4  He usually starts off with the QPO, with the idea of playing the QG which I decline.  But, once he plays this, I answer with my usual.  Now, the next couple of moves are standard.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3 {But, I was surprised to see this.  The mainline continues with 3.d4, cxd4 4.Nxd4, a6 as that's what he taught me.  As the saying goes, however, "Don't trust your opponent."  Once he deviates, I'm going to play it differently myself by developing and threatening his pawn.} Nf6 4. d3 {Not to my surprise, he protects.  But, figuring that 3.c3 was inaccurate, I decide to continue developing by pinning his Nf4.  What comes to mind is what Ken recently taught me which is that it's not a good idea to break the pin with 4...Be2  So, another way of saying it is that I'm trying to put compromises and even on Jack's position.} Bg4 5. Be2 {?! But, he breaks the pin, anyway.  So, even though the move is inaccurate, with what Ken said, my instincts and thoughts were still correct because he did teach me that the most common way to break the pin is with the B, whether the pin is on the K or Q side.} Nc6 {Meanwhile, I continue with my development.} 6. Nbd2 {As does he.} g6 {Since it's not an type of Indian Defense, combined with, the fact that I didn't fianchetto on the other side, and that the e square is somewhat cramped which would limit the B, I do not hesitate or consider anything else, other then fianchettoing at once because I have nice long, and thus, comfortable, diagonal for my Bf8.  All I'm interested in is castling, at this point, so my thinking is solely based on that.} 7. d4 {He puts a temporary stop to that, as I cannot let Jack win a pawn here.} cxd4 8. cxd4 Bg7 {But, now, I take advantage of the opportunity to put the B on the long diagonal, as noted earlier.  Since it's exchanged, it's the same idea as nothing else was going to come into consideration.} 9. d5 {Of course, this move delays castling, as I need to protect my N.  After which, he decides to exchange, and I have no problem accepting.  That's because this time, I feel that Jack is not making the best choices because he, just like what I learned from Ken, might need those pieces later on.  The problem with this thought process is that I'm already starting to become overly confident, which I've done in other games, and it'll show in the end which will later on lead to my downfall.} Ne5 10. Nxe5 Bxe2 {I had a long think about Good or Bad bishops.  At first, I thought his B was the weak one and, thus, was not going to exchange.  But, looking more into it, I realize that there might be potential for this to become dangerous.  As such, I changed my mind and decided that his Be2 was good Bishop, that's why I decided to take as it's being exchanged for my bad Bishop.} 11. Qxe2 dxe5 12. Qb5+ {I was surprised to see the check.  I asked myself if not exchanging would've prevented it, and the answer is no since it was on a different diagonal.} Nd7 {I had a hard time figuring out how to get out of check.  At first, I thought that I had lost castling rights.  But, then I realized that this was the other way to get out of check.  And, it's the only that I can castle.  Therefore, I was going to get out this way since almost nothing else comes into consideration, besides castling.  I also kept in mind that he's going to take on b7.  Unlike with the previous pawn, it does not bother me because of what I learned from GM Susan Polgar about the London System.  What she said is that taking that pawn is known to be dangerous, and thus, blunderous because the Q usually gets trapped.  And, when it does not, there are ways to get the Rook.  So, I'm trying to apply what I learned from her for this game, even though, it started off with a completely different opening.  The problem is that it won't work here, but I'm hopeful.  And, it does work several moves later when Jack plays a different move which will turn out to be a super blunder.} 13. Qxb7 O-O {In the end, all I care about is the fact that I could castle.  I did, however, consider delaying this with 13...a6 with the idea being to trap the Q, using the Polgar method.  But, I looked at variations after that, and in all of them, there's no way to trap the Q.} 14. O-O {Meanwhile, Jack castles, as well.  And, now I go for it by attacking the Queen with 14...Nc5.  That's because in those variations, Susan also mentioned that this is a different way of trapping it in the London System.  I know that Jack's options are limited, but he finds a move that gets his Q out.  In the process, my Knight gets attacked.  So, based on 13.Qxb7 being played, I'm still looking for a way to win material.} Nc5 15. Qb5 Rc8 {Still trying to trap his Queen, I add a defender to my Nc5, rather then, retreating it to d7 which is something that I had also considered.} 16. f3 {This was played to give Jack solid pawn chain.  But, that does not bother me since I'll now attack his Queen with the exact same move that Susan mentioned, being 16...a6.  And, that's where he prevents it from being trapped.  I am, however, still trying to figure out how to get material, so that hasn't changed since a move can fail in more then one variation.} a6 17. Qe2 Qb6 {So, I threaten a discovered check, which, unlike before Jack overlooks with his next move.} 18. b3 {?? As best would've been 18.Kh1 where the monarch is in the corner which is the safe spot, as I previously learned from him.  My guess is that the glaucoma got the best of him.  But, with this move, I'm going to get a pawn and Rook.  Winning the R is what I was really hoping for when I said that I'm still trying to figure out a way to win material.  Yes, that's what I was alluding to which has now become a reality.} Nxb3+ {Jack: Oh, I forgot the King.  Joe: Almost missed it.  Jack: You might win the game then.  Now, I said almost overlooked because of a variation before playing ...Nxb3+.  What I almost forgot is that it's check.  It was a minor episode of Ghost Vision which got corrected right away which is how I saw this sequence.  But, as we're about to see, "It's not over til it's over"  As now, getting overly confident is really about to show.} 19. Kh1 Nxa1 20. Ba3 {Jack completes his development.  This is where I get carried away as that's all I thought he wanted.  But, it's not the entire story that the board was trying to tell me.  I was worried about him getting a piece which was either going to be that or getting a pawn.} Rc3 {With that being said, my attitude is that he cannot have that piece because if Jack takes, I'll take back.  This is no mistake since both can be corrected, but the attitude (thought process) is wrong on so many levels.  Once he takes the pawn, I'm going to start getting into trouble.} 21. Bxe7 Re8 {As now, I'm interested in tempo gain.  I'm hoping for an exchange since I'm ahead.  Or, that he would retreat his Be7 which would allow me to defend with 21...Nc2 which is what I thought would happen.  But, none of that occurred.  Instead, Jack played...} 22. d6 {This move which took me off guard.  I might be up, but his passed pawn is dangerous.  And, if I get my N out, he advances it one square further.} Qc6 {So, I put a temporary stop to it which gives him a piece back, as now, it's almost level again.} 23. Rxa1 Rc8 {So, I threaten mate and try to get his other R.} 24. h3 {Opening up.  Realizing I can't mate him, I did not play 24.Rc1, but instead, try to tie his N down with 24...Rc2.  Better was still 24...Rc1+ Even though I can't mate him, I have three attackers against one defender, so checking him by bringing the Rook to c1, would've won his other Rook.  But, I was worried about what happens after that which is an eventual d7 followed by the promotion, but even after that variation, I'm still a R up, and have just liquidated the promoted pawn, afterwards.} Rc2 25. Qd3 {He attacks my Rook.  But, 25...Rc1+ is still possible and ought to have been played.  Instead, I get an unrealistic attitude of trying to win his Be7 with my next move.  It turns out that, according to what Jack implied, 25...Bf8?? is the losing blunder as he'll be able to promote and get the R back.  I don't agree with it because after the variations which is still lost, I would've played on and tried to get a draw.  So, as per ION's advice, he is my opponent, and thus, do not trust him.  But, I agree that bringing the B to f8 is a mistake as he'll equalize, but it was almost even, so I deem it to be a small inaccuracy, as opposed to, the fatal mistake.} Bf8 26. d7 Rc1+ {As now, I deliver check and trade off Rooks, figuring that this was the only way out of trouble.  First, it's too little too late, as he gets the other Rook.  Second, as noted, it's still more or less even after the promotion which is something that miscounted figuring it was lost, as he said in the end.} 27. Rxc1 Qxc1+ 28. Kh2 Bxe7 {With that being said, I cannot offer a draw, as Jack will decline the offer.  But, I try to trick him into a variation that might lead to a draw by repetition by exchanging B's.  Besides, if I didn't take, he surely would have a winning advantage, as he'd be a piece up since that B was goner, anyhow.  At least, I get compensation, in return.} 29. dxc8=Q+ Qxc8 30. Nc4 {After the promotion, he attacks my pawn, which I defend with my next move.  I also considered 30...Qe6, but 30...f5 was played to get a pawn chain.  What I didn't realize is that this chain is ineffective since it does not include passed pawns.  From experience, I've learned that passed pawns are, in general, only effective when one of them is a passer.} f5 31. Qd5+ {Not to my surprise, Jack checks, but figuring it was just a nuicanse (since I don't see an immediate win of material, I get out with my next move.)  But, like with Ken, I should've checked out the variations because I'm now in serious trouble which I didn't realize until the end.} Kf8 {I had initially played 31...Kf7, figuring that it would get me out of a more difficult situation.  But, contrary to my game against Loyd and a different game, where he mated, Jack accurately pointed out that it was an illegal move to his Q being on the same diagonal.  The reason I forgot was Ghost Vision, since it appeared to be on black square when the Queen was on the white square, leaving it on that diagonal.  But, his next move is still the same, regardless.} 32. Nxe5 {As I saw this coming, but this is where I got overly confident figuring that it was the best that Jack could do so.  In fact, I became happy figuring that I just might have a drawn.  Although not resignable (not a position where I'd resign, as I feel that there's more to learn, it's technically a lost position) as I'll explain with the variations that Jack and I played through.} f4 {?? In fact, after taking another look, I figured that Jack might have made another blunder, as I was, believe it or not, trying to plan a mating sequence but missed the very basic rule that bhidragon taught of, is my monarch attacked and can I get mated.  In fact, during that game, bhidragon asked me how I could miss a back rank.  Well this isn't a backrank mate but it's as easy to stop, and thus, I shouldn't be missing something like this.  But, the reason is the same as I talked about attacking lines and having an overwhelming attack, which I thought might happen here.  So, what he said, "You forgot the first and most basic rule ... is the King under attack!  A brilliant move that opens an attacking line is worth nothing if you get mated." Similarly, I forgot the same basic rule and for the same reason.  So, likewise, I felt that black might have an overwhelming attack here.  I was planning a mate and assumed that I might have some overwhelming attacking forces with Jack, just like my rated game with bhidragon, so yes I had gained some intelligence from that game, but it was too much for my own good.  With the pawn on f4 now, I was thinking along the lines 33...Bh4, followed by, 34...Qg5, and then, 35...Qg3+ as I thought it was mate but realize that he could answer with 36.Kg1  At the time, though, I thought that 35...Qg3+ was mate.  But, what I missed is that this attitude is going to get me mated.  So, we studied variations, and Jack's correct that best was either 32...Ke8 or 32...Kg7  After 32...Kg7, he has 33.Qf7+, but that loses my B.  The variation, however, we played through was 32...Ke8, but then comes 33.Qf7+, Kd8 (forced), and after 34.Qg8+ the Bishop is also goner.  So, it's still a lost position, but I would've played on.  With this move, it's over at once with the mate that I had overlooked.} 33. Qf7# {After this, Jack told what I did wrong, and I agree but at a later phase as it is how I lost.  So, the moral of the story is don't get so comfortable in the endgame, especially when you're a piece up and under pressure, which is what happened.  In it, he said that I went wrong by allowing him to get back his Rook, which implies that 25...Bf8?! was the losing blunder, for had 25...Rc1+, at once it wouldn't have happened.  But, the decisive blow, however, was 32...f4?? which is what allowed the mate.  Had I defended accurately, he would've won the piece, but contrary to what he said, I might have still had a chance to get a draw, and thus, would not have resigned.  But, the moral is still the same as it was the way I was thinking, and thus, led to becoming too comfortable, and thus, overly confident.  }
