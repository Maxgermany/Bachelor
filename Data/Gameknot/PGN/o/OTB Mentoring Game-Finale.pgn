[Opening "King's knight's gambit (C34)"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual.} e5 {This is where Jack gave me the wrong information about our game.  As he said, "I'll make it easy for you this time since you didn't defend accurately in our last game."  It's where he wrongly told me that 5.Nb3 was the losing blunder, when in turns out, that there was nothing with that move, whatsoever.  It was later on when failing to exchange Queens.  Maybe he felt that I played so badly that Jack would give me a chance.} 2. f4 {But, I had the KG in mind.  Yes, after TA showed it, I tried it against reversion in our latest game, as per his advice to try different opening that originate from 1.e4, e5  However, never mind just KG, I also wasn't used to KID until I played in my training game with Kenneth_fiore_3.  He recommended that I get use to that and then play this.  Well, it didn't go smoothly, but I won against this defense against my student Mike.  Was that a deserved win?  No, I had made some terrible blunders, starting in the opening with that unwise double fianchetto.  Then, came a move in which I blundered a Rook.  It was only the failure to get the N out and other things that enabled that win.  But, I felt that after a while, I had enough experience to play this gambit.  However, a game chat started.  Jack: I'm not crazy about this move and didn't have it in mind.  Joe: I was interested in trying the KG to get more experience it.  I felt that this is a good way to start since it's a training game.  Jack: It's allright.  Mr. Stockel wasn't crazy about this because what he had in mind was my usual Spanish Opening or, perhaps, Guaco Piano.  So, openings that were a little more common then this.  But, as you saw, he went along with it.  } exf4 {Not to my surprise, Jack accepted this gambit.} 3. Nf3 {Unlike the game with reversion, though, I stick to the mainline.  What I also like about this is that it develops the K side and will enable castling.} Nc6 {Likewise, Jack continues with his development.} 4. Bb5 {As do I, whilst, treating it, as though, it were a Ruy Lopez to allow castling, as well.} Nce7 {He said, "I'll play something crazy which isn't usually done."} 5. O-O {Not knowing what Jack's plan might be, I castle, at once.  As K safety is very important.} Nf6 {Meanwhile, he develops another piece.} 6. Nc3 {As do I.} c6 {Attacking my Bishop.  At first, I didn't know why.  But, after what reversion and charleshiggie outlined (in his annotation) I realized that it's similar to white playing c3 and then d4, also known as, "c2-d4 plan."  The same thing could be said but in reverse since black is doing this.  So, his plan is to get a pawn chain with the gain of tempo, as 7...d5 will be played.} 7. Bc4 d5 {That pawn chain, however, was of no concern because of my e pawn.  With that being said, I'll exchange before retreating again.} 8. exd5 cxd5 {Jack: You took it?  Joe: Yes, if I didn't take, wouldn't I lose material?  Jack: I guess so.} 9. Bd3 Bg4 {However, I overlooked this move.  And, that's because of the fact that my Nf3 is pinned.  So, I'll break the pin for now with the most common move.} 10. Be2 Qb6+ {At first, I wasn't sure what to do but figured out that this is a nuicanse.  Maybe, Jack was hoping that I'd answer with 11.Rf2?? which would leave my Rook pinned.  The reason that it won't work is because I remember previous advice that he gave me which is that part of King safety is bringing the monarch to the corner.  Mind you, that on that particular day, I played against Jack and Tom.  In both instances, my failure to play Kh1 is what sealed my fate.  The first one, though, was two pins which could've been broken with that move.  And, in the second game, which was against Tom this teacher handed down that moral which I haven't forgotten.  Jack: You moved the K?  Joe: Yes.  It's better the leaving my R pinned.  Jack: It's ok.} 11. Kh1 h5 {I'm not exactly sure why Jack played this, but I think that he's trying to get a passed pawn.} 12. Re1 {Meanwhile, I centralize one of my Rooks since that's part of center control, as I learned with elyhim in one of his annotations.  Part of my plan, though, involves pinning his N in the center since it would blend in with a pinning motif, similar to what I learned with GM Susan Polgar in her book, "Chess Tactics for Champions".} h4 {This is why I think that he might be trying to get a passed pawn.} 13. Bb5+ {Meanwhile, I try to put Jack in a nasty situation with this check.  This was also played to pin his Ne7, as noted above.} Nd7 {I had anticipated 13...Kd8 which appears to be better.  By playing this, though, he's now left with two pins that I'll attempt to take advantage of.} 14. Qe2 {The idea is to an attacker to the pin.  Believe it or not, I had considered another move that, coincidentally would've been better.  That was 14.Nxd5!, but I was worried about 14...Qxb5?? which appears to lose a piece for pawn for white.  But, there was a move that I overlooked.  If he took back, I'd be able to win his with 15.Nc7+! since that would be a family fork, somewhat similar to what I overlooked with Bernard a week ago when he got that fork and this teacher was horrified.  So, I don't think that Jack would've taken back on b5 which would leave him a pawn down.} Qd6 {Seeing what I could've done, Jack now protects d5.} 15. Qd3 {So, I threaten again by adding another attacker, whilst, breaking the pin that he had on my Nf3.} Be6 {Breaking the pin on his Ne7, but Jack's Nd7, however, remains pin.} 16. Ne5 {Keeping that in mind combined with the fact that he can't take here with my Rook, I add another attacker to that N.  What I forgot, though, is that it's defended a second time by his Be6.} a6 {Attacking my B.  But, overlooking what I mentioned, I take because it appears to win a piece.  What I forgot about, though, was 18...Kxd7, after which, I haven't won anything.} 17. Bxd7+ Bxd7 18. Nxd7 Kxd7 19. Qh3+ {But, I kept in mind that this check was entirely possible.  I'm trying to see what kind of damage I can cause.} Kc6 20. d3 {So, I open up a line for my Bc1 in order to complete my development.  But, I've also got plans against h4 plan.  With that being said, I'm trying to calculate a way to get that Bishop on the same diagnol, where it would be threatened.  And, my teacher picks up on that.  Jack: What do you want?  You wanna my pawn.  I nod, and he said, "I'm not gonna give you that pawn."} g5 {Which that comment is evident by this move since it's now defended.} 21. Bd2 {But, that, however, is where I come up with the shorter plan to complete my development.} Qd7 {I'm not sure why he played this.} 22. Re5 {So, I try to add an attacker to his d5 since my plan, then after, was to play 23.Qf3  But, the order is reversed since better would've been to play 22.Qf3, and then, this move.  As now, he's going to exchange Queens and mess up my pawn structures around the monarch.} Qxh3 23. gxh3 Rg8 {Trying to get a passed pawn and attack my weakened King.} 24. Rg1 {I considered 24.Re1 to double up.  But, after careful consideration, I decided on this move as it will get a pawn back.  In this case, his g5 pawn.  Right after this move, the game timed out.  That doesn't actually mean that it was a timed game, as we know.  Rather, it's noon, and I have to pack up and put things away because my shift starts 2 hours after this game.  If I had more time, I would've continued  At first, I would've recorded this game as unfinished or in progress.  However, Jack offered me a draw, when he found out that I had to go.  And, I accepted the draw which makes the first time in a long while (between 2-4 years) that I was able to hold a draw against my teacher.  What's more is that it was with a defense that I wasn't used to which makes it the first time that I could get a draw against a much stronger player in that situation.}
