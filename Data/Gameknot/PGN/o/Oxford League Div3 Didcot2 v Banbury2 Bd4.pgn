1. e4 {Last night's match was against the division leaders, who outgraded us comprehensively on all boards.  We were, and remain, in second place, despite losing 2-4, made up of draws on the top 4 boards and losses on boards 5 and 6.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {The Sicilian Dragon: against which I have had limited success in the past.} 6. f3 {A standard move that prepares Be3 and a kingside pawnstorm.  I believe that the usual strategy is that White castles queenside and Black castles kingside.  Then they race to break open the enemy kings' positions.} Bg7 7. Be3 Nc6 8. Bc4 {Not sure that this is standard but it seemed good at the time: it attacks the normally weak f7 pawn and prepares to defend the pawns in front of a queenside-castled king.  It also gives White the option of castling kingside.} Bd7 {I'd expected Black to castle immediately but he delayed that in favour of preparing to control the half-open c-file.} 9. Qd2 {Preparing both queenside castling and attacking the fianchettoed bishop, but I have to be careful not to over-burden my queen with defending both Bh6 and Nd4.} Rc8 {Black plays very actively, preparing to get his attack in first.} 10. Bb3 {I didn't want this B exposed to a discovered attack, eg 10. ...Nxd4 11.Qxd4 Nh5 especially as I wanted to play Bh6 soon.} Ne5 {Threatening ...Nc4 and meanwhile defending f7 but this second move with this N delays Black's completion of his development just too long.} 11. Bh6 {! By attacking the fianchettoed B before Black has castled, I severely inhibit his completion of his development.} Bxh6 12. Qxh6 {There is no safe way for Black to chase this Q away, so he just has to carry on attacking, but without his key black-squared B.} Nc4 {Threatening to capture on b2, thereby ruining White's queenside before he can castle. } 13. Bxc4 Rxc4 14. Nde2 {Preferable to retreating the other N as the Nd4 would have been vulnerable to attack by ...e5, diverting the N from defence of c2.} b5 {Threatening to win the c2 pawn after ...b4.} 15. O-O-O {?!  I knew I was walking into a fierce attack but believed I would be able to defend myself and then take advantage of the fact that Black's K was stuck in the middle, preventing his Rs from connecting.} Qc7 16. Rd2 b4 17. Nd5 Nxd5 18. exd5 Qa5 {?!  I thought 18. ...Bf5 would have won, because I didn't think I could defend c2 properly but in our brief chat after the game, Gary reckoned that I had a saving resource with Nd4 at the appropriate moment, but I can't see how that would have helped: eg not 18. ...Bf5 19. Nd4 Rxd4 20. Rxd4 Qxc2++ Nor 18. ...Bf5 19. Qe3 Bxc2 20. Nd4 Be4+ 21. Kd1 Rc1+ 22. Ke2 Rxh1 ...  Perhaps he'd seen something I haven't.} 19. Kb1 Rc5 20. Rhd1 Qa6 {Black patiently rearranges his attacking pieces while allowing me to complete my development by doubling my rooks} 21. g4 {I was glad to have the time to prevent ...Bf5.} Ra5 22. Nc1 {Everything seems to be holding but I'm wholly committed to defence now and my Q is still out on a limb.} Ba4 {Not sure this achieves much ...} 23. b3 Bd7 24. Qg7 {?! finally putting a kibosh on Black ever castling and enabling me to recentralise my Q but after the game our Bd1 suggested that I should have preceded this move with 24. Re1!, followed by 25. Qf6 threatening mate.} Rf8 25. Qd4 {I started to feel a bit more comfortable now.} Rb5 {We now commence a long period of manoeuvring to try to gain a decisive advantage by shifting threats to, and defences of, weak spots.  This move begins preparation for the advance of Black's a-pawn.} 26. Nd3 {Relived of its immediate defensive duty, the N advances to a better square.} Qb7 {Renewing the threat to d5.} 27. Ne1 {I was somewhat concerned when making this move that I might need to return the N to c1 pronto when Black had finished his manoeuvring but I didn't want to tie it indefinitely to that duty and the immediate need was to renew defence of d5.  The other need was to ensure that after any clearance of material f3 was defended.  Further ahead, I was considering the possibility of f4 and Ne1-f3-g5.} a5 28. Re2 {With no immediate threat from Black and no constructively defensive move available, I decided to begin to set up a threat to Black's King at last.} Rc5 {Allowing Black's B to support the advance of the a-pawn and ensuring that I have to continue to be prepared to defend c2.} 29. Qe4 Bb5 {Defending e7 and attacking e2.} 30. Re3 Ba6 {Allowing Black's Q to defend b4 when the a-pawn advances.} 31. Rd4 {I was a bit concerned now that my pieces could get trapped in the centre but this was necessary to allow my N to return to d3 while keeping d5 defended.} Kd8 {Black unpins his e-pawn and possibly prepares to connect his Rooks.} 32. Nd3 Bxd3 33. Rdxd3 Re8 34. Qd4 Kd7 35. Re2 Rg8 {Unexpected ... Perhaps he thought that I was threatening to return to g7 to win a pawn or two.} 36. Qe4 Kd8 37. f4 Qd7 38. h3 h5 39. Rg3 hxg4 40. hxg4 Qb7 41. Rd3 Rh8 42. f5 gxf5 43. gxf5 f6 44. Qe6 Qd7 45. Qe4 {I wasn't confident that swapping Queens would help me as my pawn structure didn't look as strong as Black's.  The remaining moves consist of more attempts to pressurise my defence of my pawns while I endeavour not to blunder ...} Rh5 46. Rf2 Qc7 47. Rdd2 Rc3 48. Rfg2 Qd7 49. Rdf2 Rhh3 50. Qd4 Rc5 51. Qe4 Rh1+ 52. Kb2 Rd1 53. Rfd2 Rxd2 54. Rxd2 Qb7 {and, with less than 5 minutes on his clock, compared to my 16, Black offered the draw.  Even with my extra time, I didn't think I could force a win, so I quickly accepted.  We'd already lost the match anyway.}
