[Opening "Sicilian (B32), Labourdonnais-Loewenthal (Kalashnikov) variation"]

1. e4 c5 {The dear old Sicilian Defence, more popular these days even than the Mutual king's Pawn (1...e5), owing to its aggressive attempt to wrest from White the initiative.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {A popular second move by Black, but it obviates - for reasons I won't go into here - lines like the Dragon Defence or the Najdorf.  Not that's any hardship for Black, nor ought this information be hugely reassuring for White.} 3. d4 {A crossroads.  White still had the option to play a Closed Sicilian, but with this central thrust irrevocably embarks on the much more popular Open game.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {The Lowenthal Variation - described in MCO 11 as 'a kind of hyper-accelerated Boleslavski-Pelikan-pawn-push dating back to 1839!'  It goes on: 'It has ... retained its feasibility.'  These ...e5 counter-thrusts by Black (a feature also of the Najdorf) herald an aggressive approach to the game by Black.   There is a downside, however, and that is the d5 and d6 squares become weak and the Black d-pawn backward.  Black 'expects' that his active play will mask or offset this strategic defect.} 5. Nb5 {This move is just about White's automatic response to Black's central aggression, and indicates White's readiness to go toe-to-toe with his opponent.  Also feasible were 5.Nb3 and 5.Nf3, but neither places any pressure on Black.  The text move immediately tries to exploit Black's weaknesses on the d-file.} Nd4 {(?)  In general, moving a piece twice in the opening is not a good idea 'unless there is a tactic'.  On the other hand, White's knight has moved 3 times already, and will soon have to make a 4th.  But given the strategic risk inherent in Black's choice of line, perhaps more celerity in development is called for.  Indicated (and usual) is 5...d6, solidifying the centre, and freeing the light-square bishop (LSB), and gearing up for Q-side expansion within a few moves.} 6. Nxd4 exd4 7. Qxd4 {Oh, yes.... and Black lost a pawn as well.  He is now left into the bargain, an isolated d-pawn (a.k.a. IQP or 'isolani').  Note that White's Q is nicely placed, unassailable, in centre board.} Nf6 {(?!) 'Knights before Bishops' quoth GM Lasker.  But circumstances alter cases.  At the moment, White's small advanced guard is imposing a little bit of a crimp in Black's game.  One way to free this is to enquire of White if he is interested in exchanging Queens: 7...Qa5ch  8.Bd2 Qc5.  After 9.Qxc5 Bxc5, Black will have at least have caught up in the race for mobilization (development).  The Queen exchange itself would be justified by its effect in freeing Black's game.  Meanwhile...} 8. Bg5 {(!?) Was this intended to provoke Black's next?  Instead, White could have caused at least one red face across the board by playing 8.e5, whereat Black's only feasible response is 8...Ng8 - a loss of two tempi!} Qa5+ {Forking K and B.  Fortunately, White can defend both...} 9. c3 {(??) ...but fails to spot the threat, and hence loses a piece and, pretty much, the game.  Instead 9.Bd2 Qc5 invites Q exchanges in circumstances similar to that two moves ago, but in which Black has stolen a march (...Nf6).} Be7 {(??) Black hadn't seen it either!  Well, this sort of mutual oversight is not unknown even among grandmasters, but all the same, one wonders what Black had in mind for the Queen check.  Bearing in mind that the move played is a poor second best, it still made a lot of sense to prevent the further break-up of Black's pawns after Bxf6.  Of course, ...QxB would have served the same function.} 10. Bc4 {(??) Developing, but still failing to connect the dots between a5 and g5.  Black is the first to wake up...} Qxg5 {Gotcha!! (I've always rather hated that headline in the British Press, but it works here).  Not only does this pick up a piece, free, gratis and for nothing; it threatens ...Qxg2 and ...Qc1ch.  Fortunately White can escape with a developing move...} 11. O-O O-O 12. Nd2 {Completing his mobilization.  Black still has some work to do there, but with his extra piece has nothing to worry about.} Bc5 {(!)  Fine move, placing his bishop on a more active posting before mobilizing his Q-side.  12...d6 would have shut the DSB pretty much out of the game.  } 13. Qd3 {Note that White will have trouble generating any kind of counterplay based upon f2-f4.  Maybe already he should be looking to the d-file and the Q-side for possible counter-action.} d6 14. Nf3 Qg4 {Hoping to induce h2-h3, perhaps?} 15. Rae1 {The e-pawn had to be defended, and White in understandably reluctant to relax his guard over f2.  } a6 {(?!) The GK engine much prefers 15...Be6, here, and I'm inclined to agree (I don't always).  For one thing, if White exchanges bishops (he has little other option), Black find his f-file opened for the Rook(s).  However, this pawn advance does secure the DSB's tenure of the a7-g1 diagonal, and its pressure on f2.} 16. h3 {(?) Gratuitously weakening his own K-side.  I'm willing to bet Black was hoping this would come sooner or later...  Instead, White ought to have been looking to the other wing.  Something like this might have been worth a crack: 16.b4 Ba7  17.Qxd6 Nxe4  18.Bxf7ch Rxf7  19.Qd8ch Rf8  20.Qd5ch Kh8  21.Rxe4.  Black can vary from this, but so can White.  A possible variant is this: 16.b4 Ba7  17.Qxd6 Nxe4  18.Qe7!  Probably best for Black here is 18...Bf5, but 18...Be6 may be as effective, though it does carry a risk: 18...Be6!?  19.Bxe6 fxe6  20.Ne5! Qf5? (Looks plausible, but best is ...Qh5, which preserves Black's edge)  21.Rxe4 Qxe4?? (21...Bxf2ch keeps things about level) Qxe6ch and it is White that is winning!  Probably Black would have been best advised after 16.b4! to avoid the whole shambles and played 16...b5 instead.} Qg3 {(!) The GK engine indicates ...Qf4 instead, but like id=ic3man1970, I prefer this.  Two well-known motifs are being exploited here: the Black Queen and Bishop exploiting the pin at f2; and the threat of ...Bxh3 and exploiting the pin at g2.  Combining motifs: the mark of a tactician.} 17. Kh1 {(?) The obvious move - a product of panic, maybe?  But now Black wins the f2-pawn, and retains exclusive and unchallengeable tenure of the a7-g1 diagonal.  White has almost no play available, neither for counter-attack, nor for defence.} Bxf2 18. Rxf2 {(?) It is hard to determine the motive for giving up the exchange like this, unless in White's opinion Black's active and deadly DSB was worth more to Black than his rather moribund rook was to White.  Instead 18.Re2 was called for.  Now White goes a whole rook down, without the slightest chance to turn things around.} Qxf2 19. Rf1 Qg3 20. Qc2 Bxh3 {(!)  Well judged.  A whole rook ahead, Black is prepared to give back a tithe of it in a good cause.  } 21. Ng1 {(?) Hoping, perhaps, that unexpected moves, however inferior, might bamboozle his opponent?  White is busted in any case, but perhaps it was worth seeing what Black had in mind after 21.gxh3 Qxh3  22.Nh2.  The answer?  22...Rae8 would be my guess, aiming for 23...Nxe4.} Bd7 22. Rf3 Qh4+ 23. Rh3 {(?) Forgetting about the Bishop that had just vacated that square?  } Bxh3 24. Nxh3 Qe1+ {Goodbye e-pawn... } 25. Kh2 {(?) An oversight?  A sporting form of resignation?  Whatever; the game ends now.} Ng4# {Checkmate.  A good win by id=ic3man1970 against a strong opponent.}
