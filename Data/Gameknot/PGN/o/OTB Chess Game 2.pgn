[Opening "Norwegian defence (B06)"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual.} g6 {Tom usually answers with 1...e5 with which I continue with the Spanish Opening.  But, he played this.  I thought that it was the Owen's Defense, but that's only if black answers 1...b6.  That's because Ken played something that I hadn't seen too much being the Owen's Defense with the lesson being how intense openings can be.  I did, however, have a little experience because I then remember what ION said which is that I had some experience with that opening.  Afterwards, I played against a lot and had good results.  But, not having played against the other fianchetto (1...g6) and not being used to it at all is the perfect example of how unusual openings can be intense.  And, I will be getting into unfamiliar territory even sooner then I did with Ken.  So, it will be an earlier time by move order.} 2. d4 {Of course, I remembered that after 1.e4, unless the Domiano's Defense is played, if black only advances other pawns one square, the best response is 2.d4 since that develops the other center pawn.} Nf6 {This is where I already start getting into unfamiliar territory and didn't really know what to do.  That's especially since there are many options to defend my e pawn.  Usually, I start to feel overwhelmed, though, when something like that happens.  As I wouldn't know what black might do if I passively defended.  That is, with something like 3.Nc3 or even 3.Bd3 since Kenneth_fiore_3 told me to think about those things.  But, I did not do that here.  Instead of feeling overwhelmed with unfamiliar territory, I feel confident and almost happy here.  Although it is a common developing move because I played 2.d4, I deemed this move to be inaccurate which is why I didn't ask myself what to do here which is generally not advised.  But, the idea being is that now I will attempt to punish Tom for this move.} 3. e5 {And, that is with this move.  As now, I am gaining tempo which I will use to develop another piece and attack again, once he retreats.  And, I based this move on a variation that GM Susan Polgar taught me in the French Defense.  Although it didn't transpose this is a similar position with almost the same results as not only does Tom lose time, but although it seems meaningless, this center pawn chain gives white a slight advantage at this point.  I kept all of that in mind here.} Nd5 4. Bc4 {I also considered 4.c4, but that doesn't develop which is the only reason that I played this, instead.  } e6 {However, Tom could've reattacked with 4...Nb6.  That would've been stronger because after retreating (to avoid exchanging) he would've been able to develop another piece at once.} 5. Nf3 {But, I develop, and prepare to castle.} Nc6 {And, Tom develops on the other side.} 6. O-O {That's when I take advantage of my opportunity to castle, at once.} Ncb4 {I am not sure why Tom played this.  I expected something like 6...Ndb4 instead.  I wasn't as worried.  But, I feel that he might be trying to do something with this move.} 7. a3 {So, I respond with this move to stop any plans that Tom might have with this N.} Nc6 8. Bxd5 {I had a very difficult time deciding to exchange.  I normally would not here.  But, I felt that this was an appropriate time to do it.  As I believe that this gives white an immediate advantage.  I used to not exchange in the Ruy Lopez until finding out that white can't prevent it.  And, exchanging sooner was better so that white is not the one that ends up with doubled pawns.  With that being said, it wasn't forced here.  But, the reason for doing this is that now, Tom will have doubled pawns in the center which is, perhaps, the worst place to have it.  With that being said, I feel that my initiative has increased which means that I have more then just a slight edge.  As now, I have a plan for when black takes back.} exd5 9. Nc3 {And, that's with this move since that backward pawn is now attacked.  Believe it or not, I didn't think there was anyway for Tom to defend d5 pawn now.  As I felt that in all variations it was all lost.  That also came into consideration when I decided to exchange a move earlier.  But, I was wrong.} Ne7 {As Tom played this.  But, this is where I become aggressive.  In part, what I'm keeping in mind is that black still has two pieces undeveloped.  } 10. Bg5 {And, that is where I pin.  And, this one is quite nasty as there is no easy way out not to mention that my development is now complete.  Plus, I am planning to stop Tom from castling here.} d6 {?! Not liking my pawn there, Tom tries to exchange.  But, that doesn't bother me one bit.  In fact, this move is inaccurate because of my next move.  Much better would've better for black would've been to complete his fianchetto with 10...Bg7.} 11. Bf6 {As now, not only is his Rook, but more importantly, Tom can no longer castle short which is the more favorable side to castle on.  In fact, the loss of castling on one side is the reason that I played this.  After Tom protects...} Rg8 12. exd6 {I exchange.  As when Tom takes back, he either winds up with doubled pawns in the center again.  Or, when he takes back and attacks my B...} Qxd6 13. Be5 {I harass his Q for bringing that out before being able to complete his development.} Qb6 {Going right after my b pawn.} 14. Re1 {? But, I sac it.  The idea being is that if Tom takes it, my response would be 15.Bf6 which pins and appears to win a piece instead.  But, I didn't look at what happens after 16.Bxe7 which as Ken mentioned is very important.  The reason being is because I forgot that Tom's DSB still remains undeveloped which means that it never f8.  So, after exchanging, Tom would've liquidated as I'd be a pawn down.  And, his B would be in a good spot.  Therefore, I still need to work on my assessment because it was wrong here.  Much better was to protect.  Thus, I am lucky that Tom missed the opportunity to take on b2. } Be6 {As he was also worried about me pinning the N.  As noted, that pinned would've been meaningless, if he had gotten the pawn and was able to place his other B in a better spot.} 15. Na4 {Knowing what I had done, I fix my mistake by attacking Tom's Q.  } Qa5 {Not surprisingly, he reattacks.} 16. Nc5 {So, I put pressure by attacking b7.} Qb5 {By defending, my b pawn is attacked again.} 17. b3 {So, I defend again.} Nc6 {At first, I didn't see the point behind this move.  But, I do now, as c7 was attacked, after I defended with 17.b3.  I forgot that when I started becoming greedy and had taken with 18.Bxc7.  As I thought that I was winning a pawn.  What I didn't realize was that I was allowing Tom to exchange pieces.  And, the truth is that I wasn't ready for that as exchanging doesn't benefit white so the timing was off.  But, with this miscalculation that wound up happening.  } 18. Bxc7 Bxc5 19. dxc5 Qxc5 20. Ng5 {To correct my misjudgement, I played this move.  As now, exchanging will give me an immediate advantage as we will see.} Rg7 {? I am not sure why Tom played this.  But, this is his first mistake, as I will exchange here.  And, that will allow me to win a pawn.  20...Qe7 or 20...Ne7 was essential here.} 21. Nxe6 fxe6 22. Rxe6+ Re7 {?? And, this loses.  Much better for black would've been to get out of check with his K.  This move is going to lose a R for my B with my next move.  Afterwhich, black is the equivalent to a piece down without compensation.  But, that is only the beginning, as it will get even worse then that.} 23. Bd6 {! As noted this is the winning move since the R and Q are forked.} Qb5 24. Bxe7 {The reason I took this way is because of his N.  Thus, after Tom recaptures, his N will be pinned again.} Nxe7 25. Qd4 {That's when I start swarming in with my Q.} Kf7 {Breaking the pin and attacking my R.  But, this gives me a mating sequence which I am going to take advantage of starting with my next move.} 26. Qf6+ Kg8 {Of course, if 26...Ke8, I would mate right then and there with 27.Qxe7#.  But, it is only delayed another move.} 27. Rxe7 {As I take.  But, this does more then just win another piece, as now, it's mate in one because there is nothing that black do to prevent 28.Qg7#.  Seeing that, Tom resigned.}
