1. e4 {Hi everyone!  his is a game I played a few years back in the Foxwoods Open.  This game was played against someone with a rating more than 500 pts higher than me at the time.  I ended up losing this game, but I wanted to share it because it is by far the best game I have ever played in a tournament setting.  } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 {I play the closed Lopez with Black whenever possible.  I also try to get into unfamiliar lines of that opening.} 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 {This is all book lines so far} 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 Bb7 {This move characterizes the Zietzef variation of the lopez.  It can be a very sharp, tactical middlegame.  The reason I played it aganst someone so much higher than me is because he showed up almost an hour late for his match!!  I was going to try to make things as difficult as possible.} 10. d3 {This move breaks book.  Normally played is 10.d4} Na5 11. Bc2 c5 12. Nbd2 Re8 13. Nf1 Bf8 {This is very popular in te zietzef.  The bishop usualy ends up on g7.} 14. Ng3 d5 {It is usually bery risky for White to try the normal Kingside attac against the Zietzef variaton. The center is still far too voltile. I decided to add some complications to slow him down.   } 15. Bg5 d4 16. cxd4 cxd4 {I would have liked to capture with the e pawn to open up the center, but 16...exd4 is met by 17.e5 and theknight falls} 17. Nf5 Nc6 18. Rc1 Nb4 19. Bb1 Qb6 {19...Qb6?  This move is the begginning of a lot of problems for black} 20. a3 {The knight on b4 only has 1 square, and that square blocks the Q's protection of f6} Nc6 21. Bxf6 gxf6 22. Ba2 Bc8 {Tryin to drive that horridly powerful knight out of his hole} 23. Nf3h4 Ne7 24. Qh5 Be6 {defending the mate starting w/ Qxf7 } 25. Bxe6 fxe6 {But also driving away that knight} 26. Nh6+ {At this point, my opponent had used a whopping 14 minutes off his clock (except for the time he wasted by not being there).  My plan had obviously failed.  } Kg7 27. Ng4 {or had it??  Before making my 26th move, I had solved for mate after 26...Kh8 (If I was playing the white pieces.)  After my 26th move, I solved for mate after Kg7.  It's been so long, I couldn't replicate it again if I tried, but I know it involved 27.Qf7 } Ng8 28. Rc2 {plans to bring in the troops} Qb7 29. Rec1 Qf7 {!! ahaaa!, and the attack is over!} 30. Qxf7+ Kxf7 31. Rc2c6 Nh6 32. Nxh6+ Bxh6 33. Rc1c2 Re7 34. Rb6 Raa7 35. Rcc6 Rac7 36. Nf5 {?!  This move actually allows me to have drawing chances} exf5 37. Rcxf6+ Kg7 38. Rfxh6 fxe4 39. dxe4 {and there's my passed pawn.} d3 {?  I should have waited a little before pushing this pawn} 40. Rhd6 Red7 {If I had instead played Rcd7, things are still unclear} 41. Rbc6 {!!!!  This move took him almost 20 minutes to find.  The game controls were 2h/40 1hr.  He was down to under  minutes before his 40th move, and it was just in the nick of time.} Rca7 42. Kf1 Kf7 43. Ke1 Ke7 44. Rxd7+ Rxd7 45. Kd2 {and black resigns.}
