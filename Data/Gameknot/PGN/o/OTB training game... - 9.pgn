1. e4 e5 2. f4 {I seldom play this: Kings' Knight Gambit...} exf4 {not the way to go: best is probably d6, or straightaway d5...} 3. Nf3 g6 4. d4 Bh6 {hanging on to the gambit pawn: never a good idea; best is just Bg7 and develop...} 5. g3 {of course...} fxg3 6. Bxh6 Nxh6 7. hxg3 Ng4 8. Bh3 d6 9. O-O {very bold, but probably best...} Ne3 10. Qe2 Bxh3 11. Qxe3 Bxf1 12. Kxf1 {though behind in material, White has the better of the position and the play...} Qd7 13. Kg2 Qb5 14. b3 O-O 15. Nc3 Qh5 {very careless: this is only helping White, to whip up an attack...} 16. Rh1 Qg4 17. Qh6 {ough: on various levels of pain...} Re8 {not doing much, but forced...} 18. Qxh7+ Kf8 19. Rh4 Qe6 20. Ng5 Qf6 21. Rf4 {forcing the loss of the Black Queen at least...} Qg7 22. Qxg7+ Kxg7 23. Rxf7+ Kh6 24. Nf3 {White has at least restored the material balance: and there is more to come...} Nc6 25. a3 {preventing Nb4...} Ref8 26. Rxc7 Na5 27. b4 {not paying attention: the Knight has to backtrack...} Nc6 28. Rxb7 Rf6 29. Rc7 Raf8 {overestimating the power of this attack...} 30. Rxc6 Rf6xf3 31. Nd5 {finally, Nd5 comes into play: covering c2, and preparing to dislodge the Black rooks...} Rf3f2+ 32. Kh3 Rf2f1 {after first Kh5, Nf4+: after Kg5, Rxd6; Black has no play against the White King, despite the rook pair...} 33. Kg4 Re1 34. e5 Re4+ 35. Kh3 Rxd4 36. Rxd6 Rf5 37. Nf4 {preventing Rh5+, and breaking up the connection between Blacks' rooks...} Re4 {after Rxd6, exd6, Black has a hard time keeping the White pawns under control: c4 is in the air also...} 38. Rxg6+ Kh7 39. Re6 Re1 {Rxe5 might win a pawn, but Whites' free pawns are getting dangerous after c4...} 40. Kg4 Rf7 41. c4 Rg7+ 42. Kf3 Rg1 43. Nh5 {again, the Knight is breaking up the coordination of the rooks...} Rf7+ 44. Kg4 Rd7 45. Rd6 Rc7 46. c5 Rc1 47. Nf6+ Kg7 48. Rd7+ Rxd7 49. Nxd7 {White is winning...} Rc4+ 50. Kf5 Rc3 51. g4 Rxa3 {too greedy: now the pawns will run...} 52. c6 Rb3 {after Rc3, b5...} 53. c7 Rc3 {forced...} 54. Nc5 {forcing the issue...} Rf3+ 55. Ke6 Rf8 56. Kd7 Rf7+ 57. Kc8 Rf8+ 58. Kb7 a5 {losing: best is Rf7...} 59. bxa5 Rf7 60. e6 Re7 61. Nd7 {forcing promotion...} Rxe6 62. c8=Q Re4 {White has many ways to win this...} 63. Qc3+ {another option is Qf8+, Kg6 (what else? Kh7, Nf6+), Qf5+...} Kf7 64. Ne5+ Ke6 65. Nf3 {setting up a little trap: the threat is of course Ng5...} Rxg4 {takes the bait...} 66. Qc8+ Kf6 67. Qxg4 {Black resigned...}
