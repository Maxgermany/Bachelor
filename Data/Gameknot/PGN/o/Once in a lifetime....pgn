1. d4 f5 {One of the more challenging for me. } 2. Bf4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. c3 {I like this instead of c4, creating a solid defence against the B. It can become very tricky. } c6 {Strange, and I won't say good. } 5. Nbd2 {Preparing e4, just in case he doesn't plan to play d5. } d6 {!? Very defensive, but d5 would have closed the center for a very closed game. } 6. e4 {He can take and position his lsb in f5, but I need air. } Nf6 {Well...} 7. e5 {His lsb would be trapped for a long while, while I am trying the way to play Ng5-Nd6.} Nh5 8. Bg3 {Against such a strong opponent, I won't go for experiments like Bg5, h6, Bh4, f4, f3, g5, Bf2. } Nxg3 {Accepting the loss of the B pair and a doubled pawn for a semiopened column. } 9. hxg3 b5 {Black thinks in attacking but I think Qa5 was more accurate. } 10. Qb3 {Of course, forcing him to play d5. A sure draw, I think, while I keep some attacking chances on the h column. } e6 {exd6, Qxd6, Ng5 doesn't work: black can play h6, and I have not enough firepower. } 11. a4 {Attacking at all costs, this was probably worse than Qb4 or c4. I feared of the last one the resulting exposure of the e5 pawn, only barrier against the strong dsb. } bxa4 12. Rxa4 {Feeling better. } d5 {Closing the game. I have to act now. } 13. c4 {The chosen try to break. } O-O 14. cxd5 cxd5 15. Bb5 {? I am not really sure about this move, but I wanted a tempo and this prevents Nc6. But after a6, it will be simply kicked back. } Rf7 {My opponent prefers to defend. This is the advantage of good players: they take it easy... :-D} 16. Qd3 {? Avoiding ideas of Rb8, pinning the Q, and defending the B since the b2 pawn is not defended. But it was a mistake, as after a6 my B is almost lost. It saves me Ra2, so I can retire the B on a4 after Bb7, defending the R. } Nd7 {? GIving back the B to me... now a6-Bxa6. Bc6 seems good, but my K is not castled, so the exchange Rxb2, Rxa7, favours black. } 17. O-O {I see no prospectives of an attack on the h column, and this seemed better. Now the position looks even, but for the pawn's weakness. The downside of this is that this allows Bh6. } Nb6 18. Ra2 {I have to keep an eye on the a column, I can' allow Rb8 for free. } Rc7 19. b3 {! This blocks black's penetration in c4, and freezes him. But a6 is still possible for black as after Bxa6, Rc-a7 recovers the piece. } Bh6 {A downside of castling is this move. Well, now is where I have to play with GM's care... if ever possible. } 20. Rc2 {Ok, exchanges will leave and easier board to play for me, and now I can't allow black to organize an attack. } a6 21. Ba4 {I know, I know, but this was the price for the stability of the queenside. } Nxa4 22. bxa4 {Now, the two pawns are neutralized. } Bd7 {Ups! I must be careful not to allow a B's outpost on b5, so a5 is not an option!} 23. Ra1 Rxc2 24. Qxc2 Rc8 {The only advantage black can get, but...} 25. Qd3 {This threats a6, now, black has to evaluate if the bargain is good...} Qa5 {Threatening Nd2 and defending a6. } 26. Nb3 {Threatening the Q in return, and getting off the dangerous dark squares, now black's. } Qb4 {Still heading for a4, but...} 27. Nc5 {! Isn't this wonderful? :-D } Rxc5 {I was completely sure he would have gone for this. Will it be enough?} 28. dxc5 Qxc5 {?! I think Bxa4 was better. } 29. Qxa6 {Incredibly, everything in white's position seems to hold, so I can dare this. HIS K is somewhat exposed, now...} d4 {! With the B pair, is a sure bet. I can stil sac the N, so I have to go for my chances while I still can. } 30. Rb1 {! Black can defend with Bf8, but that will give me some chances to stop the pawn. } d3 {? Basen on if Qxd3, Bxa4. Wow, high tension, now!} 31. Rb8+ Kf7 {I have no mating net, and after violence is applied on d7, his K will prevent my R to cover d1, and it would be courtains. I can take the pawn Qxd3, Bxa4, but this won't have been enough. } 32. Rd8 {! Blak "has" to defend this.} Bc6 {! Leaving my Q without squares to check. } 33. Qxd3 {...so I just cashed the pawn, when maybe even better would have been a5...} Bxa4 34. Nd4 {?! This was a terrible mistake, nothing more. } Bg5 {? This was worse. True that the pawn e5 is lost anyway, because black can escape the fork (f4) with Qe1+.} 35. Rb8 {Finding a place to check. } Qxe5 {Finally, when as we saw, the fork doesn't matter. But my aim was another:} 36. Rb7+ Kf6 {? Better maybe Kf8, with the lsb ready to shield him. } 37. Nf3 {! Black has only ONE move to avoid the checkmate, and this it is not Qa1+, Kh2, and black is under unstoppable mate threats. } Qa1+ {It was Qd6, where white has Qc3+, e5, Nxe5, where after QxN, Rf7+, Ke6... } 38. Kh2 {Last chance by black, but I think he's boosted!} Bc6 {If e5, Qd6#, otherwise...} 39. Qd8# {Wow! My hands were shaking as I cleaned out the sweat from my face... I couldn't believe it! It happens sometimes... much more times 1200 players catch me for being in low form...}
