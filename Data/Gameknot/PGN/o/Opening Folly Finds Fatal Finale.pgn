1. e4 a6 {? Already odd from Black. The centre in the following moves becomes completely white-owned.} 2. d4 {More claim on the centre.} h6 {?? I have to wonder whether black was just messing around.} 3. c4 Nf6 4. Nc3 d6 5. f4 {A four pawn wall completely owns the centre. Black is already at a severe disadvantage.} Bg4 6. Be2 Bxe2 7. Qxe2 Qd7 8. Nf3 {Putting another defender on the e5 square and preparing a march forward.} c5 {Black finally contests the centre, but I'm very happy to open up the d-file, despite the loss of a centre pawn, as it will prove a nice spot for my rooks.} 9. dxc5 dxc5 10. Be3 {Hitting the c5 pawn and simultaneously preparing Rd1 to own the open file.} e6 11. Rd1 Qc6 {Not much else for black to do. Black's position is cramped and there aren't many avenues for release. This hits the e4 pawn, but the queen is easily driven away.} 12. Ne5 Qc7 {The knight is nicely positioned on e5, but unfortunately it'll have to be traded to prevent doubled pawns on the e-file.} 13. O-O {Preparing to double up the rooks on the open file.} b6 {Adding a defender to c5 and aiming to take another shot at the e4 pawn with the next move.} 14. Rd2 Qb7 {The bishop needs to go to prevent the loss of the e4 pawn. However, it proves very useful on the e1-h4 diagonal, as you'll see...} 15. Bf2 Nc6 16. Nxc6 {I didn't see many other options to keep my strong pawn presence in the centre.} Qxc6 17. e5 Nd7 {Further cramping black's position, although I still haven't found a way to realise a material advantage. Any comments on where I could have done better thus far would be appreciated.} 18. Rfd1 Ra7 19. Ne4 {The knight is aiming at d5, where it'll be a monster. But there's that pesky bishop... So, how to go about it then?} Be7 20. Bh4 {?! The bishop has to go to open up the position. I still don't know whether the sac is sound or not. Of course, black has the option not to take, which might actually be better, but I thought the temptation of a hanging bishop would be too much for my opponent.} Bxh4 21. Nd6+ {Establishing an immovable monster knight on d5 and threatening the f7 square.} Ke7 {Not sure whether Kf8 would have been better. This does allow the rook on h8 to become active - if there were time.} 22. Qh5 {Now the sacrifice begins to look a bit better. At this point, black can either forfeit the material advantage just gained with something like 22. ... g6 23. Qxh4+ (which would've been better) or try and hang on, which proves fatal. As soon as black stubbornly holds on to the bishop, the game explodes into life, via the juicy f7 square.} g5 23. Qxf7+ {!! And black is toast.} Kd8 {Only move available.} 24. Qxe6 {! This move threatens a discovered attack on the queen after Nf7+. It's hard to recommend moves for black here, but the queen absolutely must move. But instead, black chooses to go for even more material!} gxf4 {?? The queen has fallen.} 25. Nf7+ {! Black's only two options - Kc7 or Kc8, both lose the queen.} Kc7 26. Rd2xd7+ {! And again. No reprieve for black.} Kb8 {Black's last chance was to trade queen for rook and hope for a miracle.} 27. Qxc6 {And the king is looking ominously trapped.} Rc8 28. Qxb6+ {Here black resigned, as mate follows in the next move. Hope you enjoyed! I also can't get computer analysis on this game, so any opinions on the bishop sac back in move 20 would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.}
