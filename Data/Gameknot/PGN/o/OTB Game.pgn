[Opening "Sicilian (B93), Najdorf, 6.f4"]

1. e4 {I wasn't sure what Nathan would do since he sometimes plays the QPO, instead.  But, this is his most common move as well.  I think it's because the masters most used to my style of play and, therefore, uses it to his advantage.} c5 {I play my usual.  I'm wondering what he'll do.  That is, if Nathan will allow the open variation or play the closed variation.} 2. Nf3 {For the same reason, he plays the Open Sicilian.} d6 3. d4 {This confirms it, and with that, I'm prepared to play the Nadjorf.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. f4 {I wasn't sure what to expect here, but this took me by surprise.  My opponents generally don't advance the f pawn.  I guess it's because of keeping the K safe since the f pawn is generally the weakest.  But, that's generally so if it's advanced one square.  Up until the master played it, except for 1.f4, I always viewed it as an error to advance that pawn.  But, this changed my thought process right then and there, given that the master did just that.  And, I see why he played it, as I was planning to continue with 6...e5.  This move, however, changed my mind.  Instead, I will go for a fianchetto, right away.} g6 7. Be2 {Continuing with his development.} Bg4 {?? As do I.  I would've been better off playing 7...Bb4.  In fact, this is the one time where I don't listen to Ken about not exchanging just because it's possible.  That was my model during that time, but the problem was limited time.  So, in this case, my thinking was right of no matter what happens, it's necessary to exchange when possible.  That's because, even if I lose, I, at least, want to be able to finish this game, as there wasn't much time when we started.  If more time had allowed, I would've pinned.  The problem with not finishing is that it just remains unfinished because we get so busy, even if a picture of the position is taken to try and prevent that.  Having said that, I'm so fixated on time that I forget to count how many pieces are attacked and how many are defended.  So, this will cost me a piece, without anything in return.} 8. Bxg4 Nxg4 9. Qxg4 Bg7 {Trying to compensate, I go after the N.  And, I'm not surprised to see Nathan's next move.} 10. Be3 Qb6 {And, I go right after b2 which is a mistake because of what happens next.} 11. Qc8+ Qd8 12. Qxb7 {I was hoping that he'd liquidate Q's since his is a menace.  But, this is better for white, and I had anticipated him playing it to.} Nd7 13. O-O {I figured that he'd play this, and I'm about to do the same thing.} O-O 14. Nc6 {I don't know what Nathan was planning.} Qc8 {?? So, I try to exchange Q's.  With more time, I wouldn't have thought this way, but my thought process now is eliminating his Q since I found it menacing.  But, one mistake leads to another, and this will cost me the Q for a P+Q.} 15. Nxe7+ Kh8 16. Nxc8 Rfxc8 17. Qxd7 Bxc3 {I wouldn't have played this since it liquidates, but it's almost curtains, time wise.} 18. bxc3 Rxc3 {In fact, despite it being Nathan's move, I resigned right here.  The reason is because time ran out, as I had to get ready for work, at that point.  And, by throwing in the towel, I can say that we finished.  As there was just no way that I was willing to leave, take a picture of the position, and come back.  The reason is because I'm way too far behind, and there was no way that I was willing to return to a game with this position.  As it's hopeless, especially since it was against a Master.  If, perhaps, it was someone who wasn't as strong like a novice, I'd just consider the idea, but even then, I wouldn't really want to come back and have something like this.}
