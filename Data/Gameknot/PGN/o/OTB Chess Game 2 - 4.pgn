[Opening "Sicilian (B50)"]

1. e4 {Like me, this is also how Ted opens.} c5 {So, I go with my usual.  And, it stays like this until his second move.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {But, things change here.  Yes, I have played against this move, but still don't have a lot of experience with it since 3.d4 is the main move.  So, not having a lot of experience with this move shows just how intense openings can be, as Kenneth_fiore_3 showed in our second training game.} Nf6 {Not knowing what to do, especially do to being distracted, I calmly continue with my development and treat like I had played 1...e5, as opposed to the Sicilian.} 4. Nc3 {Of course, Ted has the same idea in mind.  But, there might be more, as his intentions might be 5.Nb5.} a6 {But, having enough experience to the Open Variation of the Sicilian, I put a stop to that.} 5. Ng5 {Not to my surprise, he is threatening mate with Bxf7#.  In fact, this is how I mated someone in the tournament that I'm in.  So, I am all too familiar with this pattern since TA emphasizes the importance of the f pawn in his blitz Q sac which is why I use to teach chess.  Not only that, but GM Susan Polgar mentioned about that same square in a course that I took with her.  And, Jack also emphasizes to watch the f file which is what I also tell my students.  The real question is what can black do about it.  At first, I was starting to get a little nervous because, at the time, I thought that 5...Be6 was the only option.  But, I am not ready to exchange yet, especially since my weakest pawn would be removed.  In return, I'd also have difficulty in castling since the K would be at risk of exposure.  But, following Jack's advice which I've also told my students.  That is, "start thinking", I found a way out of the whole mess and start to become happy about my position. } e6 {As this move was also available.  In return I'm continuing my development with my central and am happily cutting his diagonal.  I was interested in his next move.} 6. d4 {But, once he played this, I exchanged.  This time, not only was I ready, but I was happy to do it.  And, I did ask myself the same question that Ken told me to ask myself of why exchange and do I benefit.  In this case, I feel that I've benefited.  And, the reason was, in part, to break open Ted's center.  But, the main reason is that only way for Ted to take back with is his Queen which is what makes me happy.  As now, I can gain tempo by kicking it with 7...Nc6.  In return I am able to apply what I learned from charleshiggie which is what I taught milly64 before finding out that for the one move that my assessment was wrong.  But, what I enjoy is centralizing my N which is the entire plan behind exchanging.  The idea behind centralizing my N is to gain more tempo since his Bc4 will be attacked.  With that being said, I saw this entire variation which is why I made the decision to exchange.  That's because in being forced to protect his B, I develop another piece which brings me one step closer to castling..} cxd4 7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd1 Ne5 9. Be2 Be7 10. f4 {This does delay me from castling.  But, to protect, I bring my N back to my original square which is where it was developed.} Nc6 11. e5 {Not surprisingly, he attacks again.  I did ask myself whether to exchange pawns or not to avoid what's happening which is exchanging pieces.  The only reason that I decided not to is that we're past the opening.  So, at this phase of the game, the idea is avoiding doubled pawns since TA said, that in general, doubled pawns can become a problem.  I also considered 11...Nd7 but that appears to cramp my position which I didn't want.  At the time, I was afraid to do it, but since I did with my recent student, flatus77, I figured that it, in my opinion, would've been the best move.  But, that didn't happen as I thought that best was to exchange with 11...Nd5.  The big problem with my judgement here is that I'm thinking but not outside especially since I there are times where I am still getting distracted in the aftermath of Jack Stockel annotating a game.  So, my assessment is a bit flawed which will only go downhill from here until the terrible blunder occurs.} Nd5 12. Nxd5 exd5 13. Qxd5 {After taking back, I would've avoided further exchanges, but Ted is threatening mate again.  So, without giving enough thought, I figured that I couldn't go wrong by exchanging g5.  But, I did not give this enough analysis because instead of a piece, the only other alternative, which I think would've been better was exchanging pawns with 13.f6  Like before, however, I still did not want my weakest pawn removed from the board.  But, looking at it now since we're in the later phase of the midgame, I don't think that it would be so bad now. } Bxg5 14. fxg5 Be6 {Still wanting to castle with gain of tempo, I attack his Queen.  But, I figured that I could still hold off on castling which is what happens here.} 15. Qf3 Qa5+ {As I studied a variation with this move.  But, this is where it goes downhill, and the distraction becomes severe.  Jack's been done annotating the game for a while, but what happened in the tourney is what I'm still thinking about, and therefore, had limited concentration on this game because I'm excited to give a bigger handicap to other players in the future since I won this tournament with less time then anyonelse.  The story is that I had 30 minutes, whereas, others had 55 minutes.  But, now Jack is only going to give me a max of 25 minutes and more like 20 minutes.  Being too excited about my improvement, I completely overlooked what's about to happen here.  But, that's not before Ted's next move which I anticipated.} 16. Qc3 Qxa2 {?? I figured that instead of exchanging, better was to take here.  Yes, it was a conditional move, and this was the plan.  But, that's where I concluded that this is part of where I got distracted.  Because in the variation that led up and included this move, I had Ghost Vision right here in the worst way which should've lost at once.  I thought that Ted had moved his Rook to b1.  Had that been so, that would've won the Rook as there'd be no escape.  Since it hadn't moved, this should've lost the Queen.  With that being said, a more experienced player would've done that.  And, had Ted taken on a2, I would've resigned since there would be no compensation in return.  I feel that Ghost Vision like this is caused by getting distracted and ION told me about a game where a GM lost with Ghost Vision.  I believe that he was also distracted.  However, I was very lucky that Ted overlooked this.  Having said that, I believe that best would've been to exchange Queens with 16...Qxc3.  And, if I didn't have the Ghost Vision caused by the internal distraction, that is how I would've responded, instead.} 17. exd6 {?? But, this is my lucky break because he took this way instead.  Ted had to have been as distracted here.  I believe that for him, though, it was similar but Tunnel Vision since the focus had to have been about getting the passed pawn.  But, by playing this, I will grab his Rook and the advantage which I'll keep, instead of resigning.} Qxa1 18. O-O {After which, he castles, as will I.} O-O 19. Rd1 {This does confirm my thought of why Ted overlooked my terrible of letting him have my Queen.  That's because of the fact that, in general, with a passed pawn, it's ideal to bring your Rook behind it, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  But, in this case, it's too little too late.  Due to being a R up, I'll use it to stop his passer with my next move. } Rad8 20. h3 {Similar to Charles win against Janet, I'm pretty sure that Ted's strategy is to break through and compromise.} Bf5 {But, I put a stop to that.} 21. g4 {Still trying to break through, he attacks my B.} Bxc2 {?? Getting distracted, and this time, having Tunnel Vision, I took here.  The one thing that I forgot was where Ted's Queen was located because it was protected his Rook.  But, that's because my only focus was on the c pawn which is what Tunnel Vision is.  That was also caused by remaining reason for the same reason as how and why I overlooked the Queen blunder.  In doing so, he should win a piece back.  Had I stopped being distracted, I would've retreated with 21...Be6.} 22. Bd3 {?? I am, however, surprised that Ted overlooked the blunder and played this.  But, it is where I concluded that he was also distracted.  For, had he not been, he most certainly would've taken back as he's seen this kind of thing with other positions in different games.  In doing so, I keep the initiative.} Bxd1 {The weird thing is that in the game, I also overlooked this possibility.  In fact, 22...Bxd3, and Ted 23.Qxd3  But, this is where the position became corrupted because what I have recorded is 23...Qxd3 24.Rxd3 Rfe8 25.Re3 Rxe3 26.Bxe3 Rxd6 27.Kf2 Ne5 28.Bf4 Nd3+ 29.Kf3 Nxf4 30.Kxf4 with white resigning after 30...Rb6, for after that Ted has lost another Rook, and then some without counterplay.  So, not being able to record the rest (due to a corrupted position) combined with Ted getting counterplay right after 22...Bxd3? which is what I played, I was figuring out what to do this move.  Therefore, I made a very difficult decision to annotate this move, for afterwards the same thing happens occurred in that variation which I recorded in that corrupted position.  And, it's black winning the other Rook without anything in return.  Had I played this Ted would've resigned immediately for the same reason.  As there is no counterplay or hopes of survival from this point on.  In the future, I am going to create a door for anything that happens outside of the game just like at work.  I'm confident that in doing so, I'll be able to block and/or get rid of the unwanted distractions.  This is important because on top of the terrible blunders that I made, I also would not have exchanged pieces as often as I did; had I not been distracted because of what I learned in my first training game with Ken.  In return, this will result in better play from me.  }
