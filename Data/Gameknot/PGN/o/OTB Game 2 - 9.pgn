[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 {Ted starts off with his usual.} c6 {In general, I like the Sicilian Defense.  But, I'm going by something that reversion told me which was trying different things.  Though, I have played against it, and even, got a lucky win against a stronger opponent with the Caro Kann, more work needed to be done.  That's why, in the original Chess Coaches and Mentors club, caveman1980 did a training game where I'd chose what defense I wanted him to play.  My choice was the Caro Kann, and that loss proved that I needed more work.  Last week was the first time that I played the defense against Ted, but that game timed out, though since we only started with 15 minutes.  As I once mentioned, time controls are not absolute for most players, but they are for me due to the work schedule.  Now, that I can start later, though I allowed an increment of 10 minutes which is how I wound up with almost an hour because, due to my hours getting cut, the shift started a little later.  Knowing this, I decided to, like last week, answer with the same defense.} 2. Nf3 {?! I know why Ted played this since that's generally the best follow up.  But, unless the Domiano Defense is played, the best move is often 2.d4 when black's first move involves advancing the pawn one square.  The Caro Kann Defense is not an exception.} d5 {? Not knowing what to do, I decide to place pressure on Ted's center.  I also could've played 2...Nf6, but then white could easily defend with 3.Nc3  Since I'm not used to this, my idea is making things difficult for him.} 3. e5 {Not surprisingly, however, Ted does not abide as he keeps it protected.  Believe it or not, this is the move that I had anticipated.  } Bg4 {And, this was my plan in the aftermath due to his Nf3 being pinned.  My idea was creating tension.} 4. h3 {Not surprisingly, he breaks it.  But, I would've done that by continuing to develop with 4.Be2.} Bxf3 {Normally, I would not have taken, but rather retreated with 4...Bh5 and not been concerned with 5.g4, Bg6  But, with something different I wasn't going to chance the loss of tempo.  Instead, the other plan behind the pin was breaking, and then exchanging.  After which (since taking with the Queen is better then the g pawn), his Queen would be left out early.  After which, I'll use that time to continue with my development.  What's better is that since my LSB becomes off the board, I don't have to worry about a cramped position as it won't happen here.  Therefore, when he takes back, there's no limits since the N isn't force on the rim.  Taking advantage of that, I answer with 5...Nd7.} 5. Qxf3 Nd7 6. d4 {Opening up a line for Bc1 and achieving a pawn chain with his e5 and d4.  More importantly, however, is the fact that he's protecting his e5.} e6 {So, I also keep my e pawn protected.} 7. a3 {I'm not sure why Ted played this.} c5 {But, I go for a pawn exchange.  The idea being is that, if he takes, and I take back, my Nd7 is better placed.  Although not cramped, I remember Susan Polgar mentioning about the importance of getting the Knight to a better outpost.  And, Kenneth_fiore said that placement of pieces is essential.} 8. Nc3 {? Continuing with his development.  But, this move is a mistake, as I will now win a pawn.  Much better would've been 8.dxc5.  When that happens, Ted will be forced to retreat, afterwhich, I will get a second pawn.} cxd4 9. Nb5 Nxe5 10. Qb3 a6 {? Trying to gain a tempo.  As corrected before, you have to base it on the position.  But, in this context, I thought that it was playable.  Terrible thought process as I overlooked his next move.  As usual, one move attacks fail, more often then not.  Then again, I don't if I could've prevented him from getting a pawn back.  I thought that the best move would've been 10...d3, but he has another attacker, and can still get my d4, one way or another.} 11. Nxd4 Nf6 {Meanwhile, being way behind in that department, I continue with my development.  } 12. Bf4 {So does Ted.} Bd6 {? Which enables me to complete my development.  But, this is a mistake as he is going to win even out the game.  Worth noting that I'm not distracted, yet, got fixated on developing that I, once again, wound up overlooking this attack.} 13. Qxb7 Nh5 {Thinking about what to do, I decide to attack his Bf4 by placing my N on the rim.} 14. Nc6 {And, he defends.  But, this is where I start running low on time.  Plus, the middle school has just set up their instrument, as there is bound to be a jazz band concert.  In fact, they're warming up on the other side of the room, and everyone is feeling the vibration.} Nxf4 {?? With that being said, I took his Bf4 without thinking twice about it.  This is a basic mistake that a mentor told me not to do which I taught my students.  But, the two things that affected my play was the time crunch (which I've dealt with before).  More importantly, however, was the warmup from the jazz band.  Therefore, I captured because it looked good figuring that Ted made a mistake by not defending his Bishop.  But, this is where, "To take is a mistake".  Another way of looking at it is that I missed the important since my Queen is en-prise which makes this move a super blunder.  That was why he played 14.Nc6  With that being said, the only way to save the position was to exchange with 14...Nxc6.  If things were normal, and we didn't have a jazz band, I would not have made this mistake.  That's because I would've focused on what Ted was threatening before taking his Bishop.  On the other hand, it might as well be, for had I played the right move, I'm 99% positive that we wouldn't have finished as the game would've timed out.  When this mistake occurred, there was only about 6 minutes, and the game is far from over.  If I didn't have to work, things would be different, as they allow people to stay late.  But, one must show up and be on time for work, in my place.  So, the work schedule takes precedence.} 15. Nxd8 {With that being said, winning my Queen was enough for me to resign.  If there was more time, I would've played on.  That's because on one or two occasions, I made a somewhat similar blunder and lost my Queen.  But, using TA's blitz Q sac methods, I managed to win.  The fact, though, is that I had to go, so I was just going to forfeit.  When this happened, Jack looked at me and was quite frustrated that I let him win my Queen.  I told my teacher that I was distracted by the time issue (although I forgot to mention about the band.)  And, he said that it was inexcusable as I just shouldn't have overlooked it.  Normally, I agree with that but not this time.  I concur, that the mistake ought to not have been made since I'm too experienced for that.  But, I disagree that it's inexcusable because I'm prone to making mistakes when distracted.  More important, is that, this loss against is going to help one of my students, as well as, others who make mistakes due to distractions.  With that being said, you, in general, don't want to play when distracted.  On the other hand, there are times where you can't avoid distractions and must play, like this.  Therefore, the moral is that in those situations, as well as, in life, what matters is, "the here and now".  If you're playing and get distracted by other things that are difficult to drive off, just focus on what's happening and where that concentration is needed.  Had I done that, I wouldn't have missed the threat.  And, this game, more then likely, would've been unfinished, as opposed to, lost.}
