[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C61), Bird's defence, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 {Of course, I start off with my usual.  Now, I'm not sure how Stanley is going to respond since this is my first game with him.} e5 {But, after playing this, which doesn't surprise me, I stick with what I know by developing.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Once he continues developing this way, I play my favorite opening being the Ruy Lopez.} 3. Bb5 Nd4 {I was surprised to see this played.  I'm used to seeing black answer with the Berlin Defense being, of course, 3...Nf6.  But, I have seen this played.} 4. Nxd4 {With only about 20 minutes, I forget about what I was taught.  That's because I just go for it by not thinking twice about exchanging.  In other words, this is a time where I exchanged just because it was possible to do it.  Ken revealed that this isn't the way to go or think in our first lesson, so it's worth noting that if I had more time, I would've refused just as he did with me.  Instead of playing this, I would've exchanged pawns instead with 4.Nxe5, and I know the drill being that black gets the pawn back with 4...Qe7  But, without a lot of time, I didn't want to play through it since I'm forced to retreat, and thus, lose tempo when time is of the essence.  So, I figured by exchanging, I was gaining that needed time to castle.  Of course, getting reckless with exchanging could, as we know, become costly.  However, I bear in mind that losing is going to help me learn, so I'm not there to win knowing who I'm up against.  Contrary to the game with Ken, if I spent too much thinking about it, the game might have timed out.  Now, if I had to pick between losing or not being able to finish the game, I'd rather lose.  That's because I, in general, don't learn as much when there isn't time to finish the game.  } exd4 5. O-O a6 {I was surprised to see Stanley hit my B, but I do what must be done to defend.} 6. Bc4 d6 {And, Stanley waists no time to develop since there's now an open line for the Bc8.  As black, I probably would've fianchetto'd with either 6...b6, or 6...g6 for a similar reason.  But, like me, after the game, I discovered that Stanley is also under a similar time restraint since he also leaves very shortly after noon local time.} 7. d3 {Likewise, I open up a line for my Bc1.  But, I only do it this way for the thrills and giggles of the pawn chain.  For, if more time had allowed, I would've given 7.b3 consideration, and most likely, would've played it.} Nf6 {Meanwhile, Stanley continues with his develop, as will I by pining the N.  And, although it's Q side, he'll break the pin in the way that we know, since 8...Be7 will be played.  Yes, this is what I would do to since that's what Jack taught me.  Though, I'd take ...h6 into consideration since Ken told me that breaking it with the B isn't always the best way to break the pin, mainly when it's Q side, as this is where the pin occurs.} 8. Bg5 Be7 9. Nd2 {With that, I play this just to complete my development.  I did consider 9.Na3 but didn't want to leave my N on the rim.  And, for the obvious reason, 9.Nc3?? isn't a feasibility, so in order to develop, the best option is to leave the N in a cramped position.  But, intend to uncramp it soon since it's about finding a better place for the piece which I will. } Be6 {But, that's not before Stanley completes his development.  With that, another exchange is forced.  If I had a choice, I probably wouldn't have exchanged here, but this is where I learned.  As I thought that with the pawn chain, which is the main thing that I was thinking about, I played 7.d3.  However, I'm pretty sure now that best was 7.b3, as then, I would've been able to retreat with 10.Be3 similar to what Ken played against me in our first game.  By advancing the d pawn, the B is blocked so that an exchange is forced.  And, yes, were it not for a limited amount of time, that's what I would've done.  But, thinking about the time was in no doubt the right choice because when the game ended, there was only about a minute or two before I had to go.  And, after the coaching that I got with Stanley, there was only about 5 seconds left, so I was faced with a real time crunch here.} 10. Nf3 {Knowing that an exchange is forced here, I bring the N to a better place, at once, keeping in mind that his d4 pawn is threatened, as well.  So, after exchanging, Stanley protects with the obvious 11...c5.} Bxc4 11. dxc4 c5 12. Qd3 {So, my idea of a good time is connecting the Rooks.  And, that is the sole reason for playing this move, as nothing else comes into consideration here.  Part of it is the time crunch, and it's worth noting that I've got 13 minutes now.} h6 {I was surprised to see him hit my B.  So, I retreat but in such a way that appears to put a little pressure on the d file.  That is my aim with 13.Bf4.} 13. Bf4 O-O {Sure enough, my instinct was not completely off as this move does break the pressure.  As now, the K side is more supported.} 14. Rad1 {Not knowing what else to do, I centralize my Rook.  But, I also bear in mind that, in general, you want the Rook behind or in front of the Queen for coverage.  That's just a known fact as I've seen in a few chess problems.} Ng4 {I'm not sure what this move accomplishes.  But, maybe he's trying to build an army against my K.  That's because what happens if he moved the N, swings down with the B, and, then brings the Q down, at some point.  Now, I'd be faced with several attacking forces.} 15. g3 {So, I figured that the best way to handle this situation is by opening up.} Bf6 {Contrary to what happened before, I just don't know why he played it.} 16. Rfe1 {So, I just figured that the response was to centralize the Rook.  And, as you might imagine, nothing else came into consideration, aside from this move.  That's because of what I noted in one of charleshiggie's annotation on what move I'd play.  And, it was this move after having one Rook centralized with the idea of doing with the other.  As I mentioned, that's what I would've done which is exactly what happened here.  You should also know that there's now under 10 minutes, so I wasn't going to spend time figuring out what else to do.  As noted, if I lose I'll learn, but there won't be as much learning if I can't finish the game.} Ne5 {Planning to exchange.  But, without giving it any though, I just abide and for the same reason that I noted earlier.  As now, there's only approximately, give or take a minute, only 6 minutes remaining.  So, now, everything is going by quickly.  However, with more time, I might have done that because I don't like the looks of 17.Nd2 where it would remain cramped, and as we know, I don't like the N confined to near my home-square (where it started) as that's what I consider a cramped position.} 17. Nxe5 dxe5 18. Bd2 {But, taking back with the pawn forces this move, as the idea is that if I lose, I play my best.  That still means figuring out how to accurately defend without giving things away, if it can be avoided.} Qd7 {Mobilizing his Rooks, as they're now connected.} 19. Qa3 {Figuring that I might have an overwhelming attack, bearing that c5 is threatened, I don't hesitate to play this move.  Not to my surprise, he defends with his Bishop which I calculated.} Be7 20. Ba5 {As that makes room for this move, as I felt that Stanley is now faced with some pressure.  This isn't so, but I was analyzing just one variation where that could happen, but that variation was, at most, 30 seconds, as I now have less then 5 minutes.} f5 {I'm not sure why, but Stanley wants to exchange pawns.  Figuring that it might need to an attack on the K, I willingly do it.  As nothing else comes into consideration.  And, as noted, similar to what we saw in my previous but strictly because of the time crunch, I exchange just because it's possible to do so.  As before, I said less then 5 minutes, but now, there's only about 3 minutes.  So, for the last few moves, I've been talking about the speed of blitz chess.  But now, it's in the fastest form that you could imagine.  As otherwise, I would've held off.  Knowing that exchange is inevitable, I would've let him take first.  But, not knowing what else to play, I take first.} 21. exf5 Qxf5 22. Ref1 {? The only downside is that Stanley now has a threat against my K side.  It starts to become overwhelming.  So, with only 2 minutes, I only look for a good move which is this.  With more time, though, I would've remembered what's important which is something that Ken emphasized in the form of a chess quote.  "When you find a good move, look for something better."  Unfortunately, there's no time to look now, but had there been, I would've played 22.f4 and would've been ready to exchange in order to prevent what's about to come.  This my first mistake because, as I'm about to discover, it's going to lose a pawn without compensation.} Qxc2 23. b3 {?? This was played to protect my c pawn and with the pawn chain, as per that obsession.  And, I'm focused on attacking the Q side without anything coming into consideration, whatsoever.  But, as Stanley implied when he coached me, this is the losing blunder.  Just like with my game against bhidragon my Queen is out of play.  Therefore, it won't be able to bring it back to the K side where it's needed.  It turns out that Stanley's attack was on the K side which should've been my focus.  In particular, it was against my monarch where he has attacking forces against it.  By playing this, first I'm going to lose the equivalent to another piece for two pawns, after we exchange, and then he takes back.  But, more importantly those attacking forces are gonna prove to be overwhelming, as it'll become overwhelming, especially since I can't use my Q to protect.  So, just like that game I missed the big picture, as I'll explain at the end of this game. } Rxf2 24. Rxf2 Qxd1+ 25. Kg2 e4 {Advancing a pawn.  At first, I thought that he was only trying to promote since that is a passed pawn.  But, it's worse then that since this along with his d4 pawn are also some of the attacking forces against my King.  And, that's along with his Queen and Rook which is what I mean by overwhelming. } 26. Rf4 {Still feeling that he's only trying to promote, I figured that this move will prevent it.  That's because I anticipate his next move, in which 27.Re4 is the conditional move to try and block.  But, 27...Qe2+ is where I figure out that there's more to it then meets the eye.  As that's where I start to figure out what he's really up to, similar to what I saw with bhidragon.} e3 27. Re4 Qe2+ 28. Kh3 {Seeing the attacking forces, I try to put a stop to it with this move.  That's because if I went back to the first rank, Stanley's next move would be ...Rf8, after which ...Qf1# will come, in which, there will be no way to prevent.  But, with this move, I felt that I could hold off a little but was wrong.  As 28...Rf8 will be played, anyway.  And, then, it's about what to come.} Rf8 29. g4 {Figuring that I could still hold off, this is what I played.  The conditional move was 29...Rf2, in which, I'd try to defend with 30.g5  But, I overlooked the next move which was mate.  After he mated, he coached me.  But, one of the things that he told me was that, taking the B with 29.Rxe7 was also an option, but he'd still mate.  Then, Stanley asked me if I wanted him to show me how, and I said yes, as that is another way for me to learn.  This is because, I thought that if I had just taken there's the chance that I might be safe but had doubts.  This showed that the variation shows that the doubts I had were correct.  For after 29.Rxe7, Stanley's move would've been 29...Rf2  From there, it is mate on the next move, no matter what I do as, 30...Rxh2# inevitable.  Similar to the game against bhidragon and ION, where I resigned, the King is pinned.  And, in order to avoid mate, it would have to move.  It's not possible, in this position because of all the attacking forces he has against me.} Qf3# {Overall, Stanley said that I played extremely well.  But, the moral of the story is based on what he told which matches with what bhidragon also said in my game against where I focused on developing the Nb1 but missed the bigger picture.  This is where Stanley explained why 23.b3?? was the losing blunder.  My fixation, as noted, was on the pawn chain, as well as, attacking on the Q side.  But, the real focus should've been on the other side of the board being K side as that's where all of the action occurred; as he had the buildup of attacking forces which were used to mate me.  Therefore, the lesson to be learned is to see the overall picture (entire story) that the board is revealing.  In other words, to see everything that's going on in that position in order to understand what it demands.}
