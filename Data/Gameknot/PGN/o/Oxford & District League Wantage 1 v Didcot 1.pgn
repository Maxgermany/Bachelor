1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 {Played after the first long think of the game.  I guessed he was trying to weigh up whether to play the 4 Pawns, the Saemisch or the Main Line.  This flexible move allows variations of all three though it doesn't particularly help the Saemisch as it deprives the Ng1 of e2.} O-O 6. Be3 {Again White refrains from Nf3, causing me to think awhile.  Eventually I reasoned that if 6...e5 would have been my move with the N on f3 it must still be good with it on g1 ...} e5 7. d5 {White plays the knee-jerk response.  Both his bishops have good ranges, albeit largely contested by Black's pieces and pawns.} a5 {?! I want to bring my QN to c5 to attack e4 and generally cause a nuisance, not such a good plan if White is really planning to play f3 and the Saemisch.  This early thrust inhibits White from playing a version of the Bayonet Attack with 8. b4, thus protecting c5 from disturbance.  Sometimes this is only played after the N has gone to c5 but that seems to be locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.  In retrospect, I think I would have been better preparing immediately for kingside action with 7...Ne8.} 8. h4 {!? Unexpected - but maybe it shouldn't have been.  White beats Black to the first aggressive gesture on the kingside and this sets the tone of the game.  Black never gets to play a typical King's Indian strategy.} h5 {Ghastly memories of the thrashing I received at the hands of Martin's teammate, Paul Paxton-Doggett, earlier in the season, informed this move, designed to stop the pawn in its tracks.} 9. f3 {A dual purpose move, allowing Qd2 by preventing the annoying ...Ng4 and also supporting the potential pawn advance g4.} Na6 {This develops the N without blocking in the Bc8 and heads as planned for c5, whence it is ready for action on either wing, theoretically.} 10. Nh3 {White also develops his N to the wing, clearly prepared to give up the chance of castling kingside.} Bxh3 {This bishop often impales itself for nothing more than a pawn on h3, so why not swap it there for White's N?  Blacks lsb is often a liability in the King's Indian anyway.} 11. Rxh3 Qd7 {The idea behind this move was to inhibit White's planned g-pawn advance since on g4 it would be pinned against the Rh3.  I hoped thereby to slow down White's attack sufficiently to generate some activity for myself.  This move also connects my Rooks.} 12. Qd2 {White prepares the typical Bh6 thrust and queenside castling.} Kh7 {This move was played to prevent 13. Bh6.  It also gives Black's N another retreat square so that Black can possibly advance his f-pawn - but actually I was already feeling that it was too late to play such a move because White was already ready to play g4.  If Black played ...Ng8 followed by ...f5, he would merely be weakening his own kingside, with little prospect of getting an attack going.} 13. O-O-O b6 {Played so that if White swapped B for N on c5, Black wouldn't have to recapture with the d-pawn, thus giving White's advanced d-pawn scope for a future advance.  I think this was too slow though.  An immediate 13...Nc5 followed by ...a4 might have given Black the start of an attack, which at least would have given White cause to think about something other than his kingside attack.  White's B is much more concerned with the holes in Black's kingside anyway.} 14. Rg1 {!  I'd expected Rh1 to defend the Rh3, preparing g2-g4-g5; but this prepares doubling on the g-file: much more powerful.} Nc5 {Black finally gets his N where he wants it but it's a useless spectator for most of the game.} 15. Qc2 {White over-defends e4 and covers the squares b3 and a4, while setting up a piercing glare at Black's king.  It should only take a few well-aimed blows for his majesty to be fatally exposed.} Bh6 {Played to prevent 16. f4, when neither ...exf4, allowing 17. e5, nor any other move allowing 17. f5 or 17. fxe5 looked attractive.} 16. Bxh6 Kxh6 17. g4 Kh7 {I didn't think I could allow 18. g5+, when my Queen's discovered attack on the Rh3 would have been useless, though it would, of course still have discouraged 19. gxf6.} 18. Rhg3 {Now the g-pawn is free to move and g6 and g7 are looking very weak.} Rfg8 19. g5 {I'd been hoping for this, since it seems to reduce White's attacking options, but it pushes Black further back into his shell.  I was now 100% preoccupied with defence, abandoning any ideas of counter-attacking on the queenside, with, for example, ...a4 followed by ...Nb3+ (a possibility I've only just seen), ...axb3 and ...Ra1+.  Whether Black could achieve such a sequence and whether it would have been worth trying, I leave to the reader to consider ...} Ne8 20. f4 exf4 21. Rf3 Ng7 22. Bf1 Qe7 23. Bh3 Raf8 {Black couldn't hold on to the extra pawn, so didn't try to.} 24. Rxf4 {Contrast White's broad acres of country estate with Black's cramped city tenement apartment!} Qe5 25. Rgf1 {Now f7 is double-attacked.} Qe7 26. Rf1f3 {Surely to be followed by tripling on the f-file...} Ne8 {I thought: I'm ready for you here!} 27. Qf2 Rg7 {Still I hold!} 28. Rf4f6 {!  Black can risk ...Nxf6 if he likes but gxf6 delivers a horrible fork.} Nxe4 {?? This throws it away but Martin pointed out that 29. Be6 was on its way anyway, so Black was already doomed.} 29. Qe3 {The N is pinned against the undefended Q.} Ne8xf6 {A few defiant gestures from the wriggling corpse-to-be...} 30. gxf6 Qe5 31. fxg7 Kxg7 32. Qxe4 {and, two pieces down without a hope of redemption, I resigned.  If you're going to play the King's Indian, you really have to get your attack in quickly.  I dillied and I dallied and I couldn't find my way home.}
