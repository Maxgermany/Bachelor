1. e4 {This will be my third annotation. I am, once again, playing the white pieces. I start again with e4.} d5 {I hate the Scandinavian defence.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 {Except for the part where I get a tempo. :) Devoloping knight AND attacking the queen.} Qe5+ {Classic responce to Nc3.} 4. Be2 Nc6 5. Nf3 {Another tempo. :)} Qe6 6. O-O Nf6 7. Bb5 Ng4 8. Bxc6+ Qxc6 9. Nd4 {I would not have chosen to use the queen in this situation.} Qh6 10. d3 Qh5 11. h3 {Checkmate will not come my way! At least not yet.} Bd7 12. Bd2 c5 13. Nb3 g6 14. d4 e6 15. dxc5 {Thanks for the free pawn!} b6 16. cxb6 {Thanks for the other pawn!} Bd6 17. Ne4 Bh2+ {I thought this was a very unusual attack he played.} 18. Kh1 f5 19. Nec5 Bc6 20. b7 {Had to happen eventually, and he can't take it with the bishop. :)} Rd8 21. Na5 Bxg2+ {?? What is his method here? Get rid of all your pieces?} 22. Kxg2 e5 23. Nc6 f4 24. Nxd8 {Why did he let go of the rook?} Rf8 25. Qf3 {Yes, I see the check.} e4 26. Qxe4+ {But he didn't see one against him!} Ne5 {I would have blocked with the queen. You might scare off the white queen and get the black queen into a better position, or you can trade them.} 27. b8=Q {Had to happen at some time or another.} f3+ 28. Kxh2 Qg5 29. Nde6+ Kf7 30. Nxg5+ Kg8 31. Qd5+ {Run Forrest Run!} Kg7 32. Nge6+ {And now, checkmate cannot be avoided.} Kg8 33. Qxf8# {And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you should not play a game of chess, especially after your opponent has promoted a pawn so that they have 2 queens.}
