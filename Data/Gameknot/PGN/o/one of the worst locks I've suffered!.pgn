[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 2. d3 {One of the worst moves. } dxe4 3. Nc3 {Whites realizes it is not good to exchange, so tries another strategy. } Nf6 {Exchanging the pawn will only favour his developement, so I choosed this one instead. } 4. dxe4 {Strangely enough. } Qxd1+ 5. Nxd1 {White saves the castilng right at a cost of a central pawn. This is very interesting, and should provide black an edge. Let's see...} Nxe4 6. f3 Nf6 {Maybe wrong. Nc4 would have prevented my own pawn or dsb to get there. But maybe this was a wrong approach to the position. } 7. Ne3 {Just ok. } e5 {And this was maybe a mistake. I've seen no point in developing while my dsb was caught in, and castling was near. And I didn't like e6 because it blocks my own bishop. } 8. Bd3 Bb4+ {If I can provoke c3, maybe he will find difficult to develop his dsb. } 9. c3 Bc5 10. b4 Bb6 {Chasing me. I thought it was ok, since he opens his king too. I was wrong. } 11. Nf5 {I didn't see it. I cannot castle, because of a fork check. Hmpfff.... clever (I was starting to tell myself how stupid I was). } Bxf5 {Not a nice thing to do, but I thought that it was the best, under the circumstances. But in an open position like this, the bishop pair was far more important that I thought. I was far to think my Nb8 wouldn't have been able to develop for so many moves on. } 12. Bxf5 g6 {This was a mistake, because my dsb can't defend the king. I thought about it, but I believed that with no support in sight, this wouldn't have been a problem for me. I was wrong. } 13. Bd3 O-O {The fatal mistake. I calculated that if Bg5, Kg7, and if Bh6, the rook was about to leave anyway, so no problem. I overlooked my own attacking possibilities instead. Castling, as I often remember to myself, is a loss of time. It may be convenient, but not always. In this case, 1) the "threat" Bg5 would only have helped me to develop my other knight. No need to castle. 2) the Bh6 prevents me from castling, but I could have thought about the game with both kings in the center - always interesting., with Ke7 (Bg5, Nd7 should hold). 3) I had to develop. Piece developement, I mean. The rook that cames out of castling is ok, but the knight has to came out soon. 4) I had my own attack too! I told I accepted my bishop chase because I wanted him to weaken his pawns. So why not Nd5 at once, before he can go a3? White has to defend with the bishop (in b2 by force, or Ne3), and I have a tempo to spend improving my position. } 14. Bh6 {Ok, no problem. I have to care for a back rank mate, that's all. I'll do it. } Rd8 {Another mistake, since white can defend by castling. It was necessary to coordinate the rook with the Nd4 plan. Now, think that I talk about Nd5 in spite of: Be4 because in that case, c6 (and not Nxc3?, Bxb7!). This would have been good for me, a fight instead of a much more terrible "lock". } 15. O-O-O {It was "now or never" the last chance to develop the knight, believe it or not. } c5 {I didn't, since I wanted to be sure I had some control of the center, not blocking my own pawn with the knight... and all this garbage. It is very easy to learn concepts, but it is not so easy to know when to apply them, or more accurately, to give each one the right "weight". } 16. b5 {So guy, where do you plan to develop the knight? To d7? With what future? I had to open some space for it. } Ba5 17. c4 {Well, so I have b6 for the knight. What a wonderful spot for it, isn't it? And I precluded myself the Nd4 move, in addition. Wonderful! :-/. } Nh5 {Let's try somehting there. But by doing that, I didn't realize that I left white able to move Be4, threatening b7. And guess what? I cannot defend it because I have to exchange the rook! How ashamed I was!} 18. Ne2 {Normlal. Now, g3 and my knight has to retreat on g7. I thought is was a bad place, but in fact it was the better destiny for the knight: route to d5! } Bc7 {I thought about Bc3, but I smelt (?) danger. I wanted my pieces to regroup. U sghould have played f5, to prevent the white's lsb to get to e4, and rediploy my knight to the route. Instead, I thought about Nf4, supporting the pawn after the exchange. Do you see because it was not a good idea? } 19. g4 {White played the wrong move: g3 would have been blocked my knight. But even more, because with my bishop in c7, there is no defence against Be4. Rd7 or RxR+, and I cannot avoid Bxb7 and lose the rook. After RxR+, RxR, my knight cannot develop in d7 because of the white rook, so I am COMPLETELY LOCKED IN! } Nf6 {? Stupidly, I didn't take advantage of my own plan, and I didn't go for Nf4. I realized the danger in e4, and I had no time to pla f5, so I had to retire here. Now, if white g5, I can only use this knight to retake the white bishop when it will take my rook. Do you see how, don't you? } 20. Be4 {White loses the chance. I can take either take the bishop or RxR+ before blak does it. It was more or less the same, right?} Rxd1+ 21. Rxd1 Nxe4 22. fxe4 {Now, the rook penetration is guarded by my pieces... provided they don't move!!!!!! What a nasty lock! And my own pawns block my dsb. } a6 {Tring to untie myself...} 23. Kb1 {Clever white!} axb5 24. cxb5 Ra5 {Attacking the wrong pawn. Ra3 was due, in order to threat Rh3. } 25. Nc3 {Ok, so this is funny: my rook is all it can do, since if Ra3, Kb2. His knight, is true, is due to the defence of b5, but is still active and threatening in the center. My poor rook, instead...} f5 {I have to untangle me, even at a pawn's cost. } 26. exf5 gxf5 27. gxf5 Kf7 {The only piece with an useful square to go!!!} 28. Bg5 {The right move to block my king. It's powerless. } e4 {Another sac, just to free my bishop! But it can't leave, really, due to Rd8, freezing my knight forever. } 29. Re1 Nd7 {At last! But now I lose the pawn. } 30. Rxe4 Nf6 {Of course not Bxh2, because of Re7+, losing the knight. } 31. Re6 Bd8 {What a wonderful game! :-/} 32. a4 {White could have played Ne4, and I would have lost a piece. Am I right?} Ra8 {Starting a long manouver with no hope, since my pawns are weak. } 33. Ka2 Be7 34. Kb3 Rd8 35. h4 Rd4 36. a5 c4+ {The wrong advance. I thought about opening a route for my bishop, in case I could have untangle it or should white have left it grip. But, even if the pawn is safe, there is no future in this advance. The rook has no place to go on the diagonal!!!  Rb4+ is with no use, since the pawn that is going to crown is the a one. } 37. Ka4 Rd2 {It was Rd3, but it slipped. My opponent choosed to accept it and play as if it were Rd3. } 38. a6 {Even so, he can bo this way, since he threats a promotion. } bxa6 39. bxa6 Rd7 {The only one to prevent promotion. } 40. Kb5 Nd5 {At least I can move another piece! NxN gives a check followed by Rxf5... at last. But too late!} 41. Kxc4 Bxg5 42. hxg5 Nf4 43. Rh6 {Rf6 check was no problem, but this is. } Kg8 {Skipping f6+. } 44. Kb5 Nd5 {Another attempt, but...} 45. Nxd5 Rxd5+ 46. Kb6 Rxf5 {Even if accepted, I cannot free myself completely. } 47. a7 Rf8 48. Kb7 Rf7+ 49. Kb6 {Now white wins by interposing his rook against mine... but I blundered. } Kg7 50. a8=Q {Ok, that's it... one of the worst games of my life. I hope the ones that hate me (:-) may be enjoing this (:-D)}
