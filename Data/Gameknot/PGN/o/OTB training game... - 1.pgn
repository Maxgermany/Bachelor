1. e4 c5 2. f4 d6 {the slow version, of the Sicilian: against this, only g6 stands a chance...} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. c3 {a profylactic measure against Nb4/Nd4: also part of the Grand Prix Attack approach; the only feasable weapon against any Sicilian...} g6 5. g3 Bg7 6. Bg2 {this also goes with the territory: fianchetto's on the Kings' wing; Indian style...} e6 {preparing Ne7: Nf6 has no place in this opening...} 7. d3 {usually played against Nf6, if or when it occurs: but also this serves a common purpose...} Nge7 8. Be3 {Black is preparing castling: White can wait a while...} O-O 9. Nbd2 {not making any decisions yet: just developing...} b5 {not bad: conquering the Queens' wing, might work out profitable later...} 10. Qc2 {here, White can still decide wheter to castle short or long: or never at all; Kf2 is a safe place...} a5 11. Kf2 Bb7 {already, Black is at least two tempi behind in development: he still needs to find purpose for the Queen...} 12. Rhd1 {preparing d4: the enevitable outcome of any Sicilian...} Qc7 {not unwise: get the Queen off the d-file; also completing development...} 13. Rac1 {still more preparation for d4: in fact, a hidden attack on Qc7...} e5 {probably better than Rc8: but not discouraging d4...} 14. d4 exd4 {keeping the c-file closed, forcing White: Be3 is trapped...} 15. cxd4 cxd4 16. Nxd4 {also forced: leaving Nd4 attacked twice, covered only by Be3, while developing Bg7; this gives Black time for Rc8...} Rfc8 17. Nd2f3 {also forced: the stage is set...} Qb6 {so this is forced...} 18. Nxc6 Qxc6 {a sound solution for now: up to a certain point...} 19. Qd3 Qd7 {sacrificing d6, but b2 and e4 are attacked too...} 20. e5 {killing two birds, with one stone: the Black Queen is again uncovered...} d5 {this looks like a solution: but it is not...} 21. Nd4 {attacking b5 twice...} b4 {Bc6 will not work: this might...} 22. Qb5 {wrapping it up: the Black Queen is uncovered, and cannot leave Bb7...} Bc6 {still, Bc6 will not work...} 23. Nxc6 Nxc6 24. Rxd5 Qe6 {forced...} 25. Rd6 Rab8 {an eye for an eye...} 26. Rcxc6 {challenge accepted...} Rxb5 {there is no use, in running from this with Qxa2: Rxc8+ is too dangerous...} 27. Rdxe6 {the best way out...} Rxc6 28. Bxc6 {very clever: Rb5 has no way out...} fxe6 {so this is forced again...} 29. Bxb5 {after this, Black resigned...}
