1. f4 {this move is a tell tale: we are in for some ancient chess theory; this is the Dutch Defense (d4, f5) reversed...} d5 {so this is the only feasable reply...} 2. Nf3 {another option is d4, followed by Nc3, and turn this into something very different...} g6 {like in most Queens' pawn openings, this is always a safe way for Black...} 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 e6 5. d4 Nf6 6. h3 O-O 7. O-O {one of many constellations, this opening can spawn...} b6 {losing no time: we need to conquer c5 and develop Bc8-Bb7...} 8. b3 {also for White the way to go: c4 and Bb2...} c5 9. dxc5 bxc5 10. Bb2 Bb7 {it is clear, that this opening is all about prolonged symmetry: who is the first, to break it up?} 11. g4 {White cannot play c4 or e4 for now, but that was the way to go: this untangles Blacks' opening...} Ne4 12. Bxg7 {Ng3 is a threat, so this is forced...} Kxg7 {now White has to deal with Ng3...} 13. Re1 {the only safe one: Kg2 is no option after Qc7...} d4 {activating Bb7...} 14. c4 {probably best: after dxc3 ep, White can just hold this...} a5 {preparing Nb8-a6-b4...} 15. Nbd2 {looking for ways to develop...} Nc3 16. Qc2 Na6 {on the way to b4...} 17. a3 {so this is forced...} Qc7 {but f4 is forgotten by now...} 18. f5 {a despearate measure...} e5 {only to make it worse: White has not a single threat...} 19. e4 {again, Black cannot capture en passant...} Rfd8 {but she can threaten d3...} 20. Qd3 {stubborn Queen on the other side: this can lead to no good, against a fierce Queen...} Nb4 21. axb4 axb4 {this is better than en passant: this opens up lines...} 22. Qf1 {given the circumstances, probably best...} Rxa1 23. Rxa1 Nxe4 {justice is served: Black wins a pawn back...} 24. Nxe4 {so he has to go...} Bxe4 25. Nd2 {this seems logical...} Bxg2 26. Qxg2 {targetting for Ra8, and blocking gxf5...} Re8 {avoiding the issue altogether...} 27. Ra8 Re7 {Black is threatening, to push e5-e4...} 28. Ne4 {mainly making a countermeasure: preparing g4-g5...} f6 {which is easily solved for now...} 29. Ng3 {a sound reply: also avoiding e5-e4...} Qb7 {but not after this...} 30. Qxb7 {of course, Qa2 is no option after Qf3: so this is forced...} Rxb7 31. Ne4 {stopping e5...} gxf5 32. gxf5 Rc7 {protecting the little ones...} 33. Kf2 Rc6 {Black can only make progress, on the Kings' wing: so we prepare Kh6...} 34. Ra7+ {White has to react, before Black gets the chance to play h5...} Kh6 35. Kg3 {the break Black needed: White is getting impatient...} Rc8 {of course, preparing Rg8+: but White sees a chance...} 36. Nxf6 Kg5 37. Nxh7+ Kxf5 38. Rf7+ Ke4 {the aftermath is not nice: for White, that is; he is getting in trouble...} 39. Ng5+ Kd3 40. Rf3+ Kc2 {Black is breaking through the center, with a couple of connected free pawns...} 41. h4 {forced, considering Blacks' next move...} Rg8 {White needs to get out of this pin desperately...} 42. Kg4 e4 {also d4-d3 will bring mayhem to White: but this speeds it up...} 43. Rf5 {going for c5...} Kxb3 44. Rxc5 e3 {and there we go...} 45. Kf3 Kc3 46. Ne4+ Kd3 {not getting any grip on the Black posaition...} 47. Ng3 {preventing e3-e2...} Rf8+ 48. Rf5 {only King moves are  g2 and g4: so this is the last defense...} Rxf5+ 49. Nxf5 {no choice...} e2 50. Kf2 {the only one...} Kd2 51. Nxd4 {until the very end: White is a full piece ahead...} e1=Q+ {also losing the Knight, in all variations: so White resigned...} 52. Kg2 Qe4+ 53. Nf3+ Ke2 {}
