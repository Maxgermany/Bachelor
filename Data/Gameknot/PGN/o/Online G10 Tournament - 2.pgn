[Opening "Beefeater defence (A40)"]

1. d4 g6 {I like to play safe and passively in the opening, so that I have a solid position.} 2. c4 Bg7 3. e4 d6 4. Nc3 Nf6 {This has transposed into King's Indian Defense, which is a very strong hypermodern opening. Black wants to develop and castle quickly instead of worrying about the center. Space is the least important when evaluating a position. Pawn structure and development are the most important. One side can have a big space advantage, but it isn't worth anything when the other side is better developed and is solid.} 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 c5 {Most players play e5 here, where dxe5 dxe5 Nxe5 Nxe4! usually favors Black, but I prefer the c5-break since e5 O-O Nc6 d5 Ne7 Ne1 usually favors White.} 7. O-O {White can go into a Benoni-type position with d5, but by ignoring my central break, White usually wants to go into Maroczy Bind, which can transpose from different openings.} cxd4 8. Nxd4 Nc6 {The Accelerated Dragon from the Sicilian could reach this position, and also a lot of different Nf3 openings. The Maroczy Bind is feared by some players, but I am happy playing against it since I am familiar with its principles. White wants to consolidate and slowly grind me down, so I need to break the bind before White can consolidate} 9. Be3 Bd7 10. Qd2 Nxd4 11. Bxd4 Bc6 {I am already challenging White's center, so f3 is needed here.} 12. f3 a5 {I thought about Nd7 here, but I was a little worried about b4. This move doesn't weaken my position very much, and it grabs some queenside territory.} 13. b3 Nd7 {I think White's best move is Bxg7 Kxg7 Qd4  which goes into the line played in the actual game, except that I would be down a tempo.} 14. Rac1 Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Qb6 {Black usually has the better endgame in Maroczy Bind, so White shouldn't allow me to force trades} 16. Qxb6 Nxb6 17. Rfd1 Kg7 {I couldn't find a clear plan here, so I prepared to bring my king to the center in the ensuing endgame.} 18. Nd5 {I personally don't think White should've allowed the trade. If White had played passively, then I would've tried breaking with Rc8 Bd7 a4, undermining the pawn structure} Bxd5 {Trading with the knight is bad since my bishop is garbage, by trading with the bishop, I get a knight vs. bishop imbalance where my jumping knight is more powerful than White's bad bishop.} 19. cxd5 Rac8 20. Kf2 f5 21. Ke3 {White is following the rule about bringing the king to the center in the endgame, but he really overdid it in this game. The king doesn't have a role yet.} f4+ 22. Kd4 Nd7 23. Bd3 Kf6 {My position was only slightly better a few moves ago, but now I like my position a lot better since White's king is horribly placed now} 24. Rc2 Rxc2 25. Bxc2 Rc8 26. Bd3 Ne5 27. Bb1 {Not really a good move, I wasn't going to trade my good knight for that crappy bishop} g5 28. Re1 b5 29. Rf1 {White offered a draw here, since he doesn't seem to be able to make progress, but I just need a bit more progress to win this. White's horribly placed king will lose the game for him} b4 {Now White is dead, I will play Rc3 for an unstoppable mating attack} 30. Re1 Rc3 {There's no hope for White now, try to find the mate.} 31. Rd1 Nc6+ {Nc6!! finishes off White, and the game is over} 32. dxc6 e5+ 33. Kd5 Ke7 {White resigned, as there is no way to stop Rc5#, this goes to show that king in the center is not always a good rule to follow, it usually is good to put the king in the center during the endgame, just don't get mated!} 34. c7 {}
