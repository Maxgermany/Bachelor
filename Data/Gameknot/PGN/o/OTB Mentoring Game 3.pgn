[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {We start off with the usual.} d6 {Although other moves like 3...Nf6 or 3...a6 are the most common, this is Jack's main response to this opening.} 4. O-O {With that being said, I'm back to castling, ASAP.  Whereas before, someone mentioned that it's better to delay which I have done before.  But, this fits my style a little more and have had better results by not delaying castling.} Nf6 {Of course, Jack is trying to turn into something similar to the Berlin Defense.  It's not a transposition since ...d6 isn't played.  But, it's something just like it since this move is played but right before you castle.  Maybe, my coach is hoping that I'd give up the e pawn temporarily as he might have a plan, for if I were to then play Re1.  In other words, it might be a conditional move.} 5. d3 {But, I take no chances since I know him all to well.  I used to defend with something like 5.Nc3.  However, I decided to try something a little different, as per reversion's advice.  Since he told me to play different openings.  Yes, it is something like the Spanish Opening to Guaco Piano to Philidor's defense, etc.  But, I don't do it exactly like that.  It's similar, but I do without changing the name of an opening.  In other words, one minute I might castle right away, and before that, it was defending with Nc3.  Now, it's in the aftermath of castling so I protect this way, instead.  It's with the idea of trying a different variation in an attempt to throw him off guard.  But, as expected, Jack has a way around this.} Bg4 {As he pins my N instead.  Since 6.Be2 is, obviously, not an option, I, similarly, try something different.} 6. Bg5 {As my attitude is a pin for a pin.  In this case, however, I have 2 pins.  Not surprisingly, Jack breaks this with his B since he, as noted, has previously told me that using your B is the most common way to break a pin.  In addition, this will also complete Jack's development. } Be7 7. Nc3 {And, my focus was on completing my development, as well.} O-O {Meanwhile, Jack breaks my first pin by castling.  Now, I expected something like 7...Bd7 but like this move better.  My guess is that he does not like my N on f3.  That will show later on.} 8. a3 {The idea behind this move was to open up a semi file for my R since TA has mentioned that it also plays an important in some of his blitz Q sac games.} Nd4 {Jack's idea of a good time is to exchange.  Well, I try to decline by not initiating it first.  But, it's going to happen because he'll force it on his next move.  Knowing this, it's a choice between N and B, and I'd rather have him exchange my N.  That's because when GM Susan Polgar said don't exchange unless there's a good reason, she was specifically alluding to a B for N.  And, that's what I kept in mind just now by retreating it to c4.} 9. Bc4 Bxf3 10. gxf3 {The downside to this is that my K side pawn structures are destroyed.  I usually care about that a lot but not this time.  As I'm pretty confident that Jack doesn't have an immediate win here.} c6 {Contrary to before, I have no idea why he played this.} 11. f4 {? Not seeing the point to his last move, I felt that it was, virtually a waste of time since I was not going to do what it might have appeared.  In fact, this move was my plan, and 10...c6 allowed that to happen.  As now, I'm trying to put pressure right on his K side.  Of course, it's on the weakest square, but the weakest pawn being on f2 is safe and hasn't advanced yet.  To me, that's what's important.  The only problem is what he's about to do as I had no intention of exchanging pieces yet.  But, this miscalculation forces that since I'm not going to let him win a piece.  However, it's a mistake because this not only forces me to exchange, but when all is said and done, Jack will win a pawn.} Nxe4 12. Bxe7 Nxc3 13. Bxd8 Nxd1 14. Be7 {Instead of taking back right away, I decided to hit his R.  I thought he's protect, but Jack takes a pawn.} Nxb2 15. Bxf8 {With which, I thought I was a little ahead when he takes back.  But, I'm wrong, as it's still level.} Rxf8 16. Rab1 {?! Therefore, I apply pressure by hitting his N.  My idea was that once he retreated, I'd win back a pawn on b7, but miscalculated what's about to unfold which will prevent that. I thought that Jack would be forced to retreat to a more passive square.  What I overlooked is that my B is about to be exchanged which I was not ready especially since there is no good reason for exchanging.  Had I looked more carefully, I would've retreated my Bc4, instead.  } Nxc4 17. dxc4 b6 {Despite the protection, I'm now ready to exchange pawns.  The reason being is to undouble my pawns on d4, especially since, this is an endgame.  As now, I'll be able to use my King as a weapon.} 18. fxe5 dxe5 19. Kg2 {So, I start by activating my King.} c5 {This was played because it establishes a pawn chain.  Doesn't affect my next move, as I'll harass his N to gain a tempo which I'll use to centralize one of my Rooks.} 20. c3 Nc6 21. Rbd1 Na5 {Threatening one of my pawns.} 22. Rd7 {So, I counterattack.} Ra8 {And, Jack protects.} 23. Rfd1 {As do I by undoubling up.  What I kept in mind is that Jack's back rank is vulnerable, so if he takes, I will mate by exchanging R's.} g6 {Thus, he opens up, or as GM Susan Polgar puts, "opening a window for the K".} 24. Rd1d5 {I go after his e pawn with the idea that if Jack takes on c4, I'll recapture on e5.  What I forgot is that when black takes, his N will be defending e5.  However, there was no way to defend that pawn because of the pawn behind it which is an example of where doubled pawns become a weakness as it was here.} Nxc4 25. a4 {Therefore, I'm planning a variation.  What I'm hoping to achieve is a passed pawn.  If I had more time, I might have been successful, but there's not enough time for that to happen.} a5 {For example, Jack puts a stop to that advancement as he thought that I'd be able to do something with it.} 26. Rb7 {But, this is where I start working on my next plan.  And, it isn't winning b6 since it's protected.  Instead, the plan is to win his f7 pawn since the idea behind this is to allow 27.Rdd7, as now, I have both of my Rooks on the seventh rank which is known to be dangerous.} Rf8 {But, that changes with this move since his f pawn is now protected.} 27. Kf3 {Therefore, this is where I officially start using my K as a weapon.  As I have advanced it past the second rank and the plan is to keep advancing it. } Re8 {And, Jack's idea is to get a passed pawn.  I'm pretty sure that if we had more time, black would've won the game.  It wouldn't take him to too long to continue advancing the passed pawn which would be the killer.  But, there's not enough time to reach this stage.  In fact, there was only a minute or two before I had to leave, at this point.} 28. Ke4 {I stop further advancement of Jack's e pawn with this move which is important.  But, that was the idea behind 27.Kf3, as I wanted to advance further and put pressure.  This time, it worked because I have to get ready, at this point.  With more time, it wouldn't have, as I'll explain below.} h5 {As he's focused on a pawn chain.  Better would've been 28...f5+, as I'm now forced to run back.  And, those his connected pawns, including the passed e pawn would be enough to win.  However, I told Jack that I had to leave, and we both agreed that this was an unfinished game.  As noted in the intro, that's why I have it as in progress.  At the time, I didn't think that anyone could win and was happy with where I am.  But, looking at it now, I'm not happy because I went wrong by miscalculating and letting Jack win a pawn.  Overall, that should've costed me the game.  I was just very lucky that time ran out here.}
