1. e4 {Of course, I notate with the idea of turning it into an annotation.  Now, this was, originally set up the wrong way with white's pieces on the 7th and 8th rank, whereas, black's was on the 1st and 2nd rank.  I would let this go in a casual game and not change things around, knowing that in the next game I could notate.  But, this is more formal then that.  And, that brings it to the next thing, as Tom Walsh doesn't say anything about me notating.  Of course, Master Nathan Resika loves it.  But, Carl, on the other hand, criticized saying that if I take notes, I'm gonna lose.  Well, first taking notes is good for improvement, and I know that he cares about playing well.  For him, it's not necessarily about winning but just doing well.  That's important for me to, but I responded and told him that it's good for improvement.  And, even if I lose from taking notes, it is worth it because I'm getting the biggest prize of all, more then winning money or being the champion.  It's getting analysis from an expert whose teaching style aligns with my style of learning since I annotate it, and his jaw dropped when I said that.  Of course, I was alluding to ION.  Having said that, I start off with my usual opening.} d5 {?1 In general, Carl deviates opening with the idea of taking his opponents off guard which blends in with why Ken wanted the second training game with me.  It was when I criticized an opening and said that it wasn't studied by masters and grandmasters.  Of course, I did that again, afterwards, with the Lasker Defense.  I then spoke to Ken about it, and he warned about this kind of thing and recommended the GK DB.  Of course, I'm not into that but will, at some point, download Stockfish which will have a list of openings.  With that being said, the Scandinavian Defense has become Carl's favorite.  ?! A week before the last tournament had ended, so the one before the start of the previous in September, I believe, Jack said that this is dubious.  And, the reason being is that 2.e5 now favors white which is what I'm about to play for that reason.} 2. e5 Nc6 {Of course, Carl wants to win my pawn.} 3. Nf3 {? So, I try to protect this way since this develops.  But, this was not the right way to go pin since Carl will win that pawn by pinning my Nf3.  Therefore, 3.d4 was essential.} Bg4 4. Be2 Bxf3 5. Bxf3 Nxe5 6. O-O {?! In addition, Carl was threatening to liquidate my Bf3.  I asked myself how to prevent this.  But, I didn't there was a way to do it.  As 6.Bh5 is met with 6...g6 which allows him to exchange.  However, 6.Be2 was the only move that I didn't consider, and it turns to be the best one available.  As afterwards, I'm still hanging on to my B which is stronger and doesn't allow liquidation.} Nxf3+ 7. Qxf3 e6 {Opening up a line for his Bf8.  But, I would've tried to develop by fianchettoing with 7...g6.} 8. Nc3 {With being said, I continue developing and even consider a N sac with 9.Nxd5, as after something like 9...exd5, I thought about 10.Re1+ as my goal was to deprive black of the right to castle.  But, that would've failed after 10...Qe7, or even 10...Be7 which is stronger.  Not only would Carl have the ability to still castle, but I'd be down by an additional move.  So, I decided not to do it.} Qf6 {But, Carl has other ideas and brings his Q out for castling long.  Like before, I still considered 9.Nxd5?? for the same reason, but this would help him out even more as he could get out of check with his Ng8 or Bf8.  Thus, I didn't want to help him on the K side, at all.} 9. Qxf6 {Although I don't enjoy liquidating while a pawn down, I felt that this was the way to go here.  As I thought that his Q was a monster.  I was worried about something like 10...Qg5 followed by a later ...Nf6-g4  I saw this setup with bhidragon and was starting to look at everything, but with the N there and the Q right around, I was worried about a very dangerous K side assault by Carl.  Where mate would be threatened, and white have a very difficult time driving it off.  And, even if I were to delay it with 11.d3, he'd still have 11...Qg4, and I'd be worried about my monarch.  So, to alleviate that and avoid the, "Fight or Flight" syndrome, I used the Yoga breathes, and decided on exchanging, right away.} Nxf6 10. d4 {As it also allowed me to play this without losing a pawn since his Q was on the same diagonal.} O-O-O {But, this was part of Carl's plan since he castles long.  However, I also get something out of it since I can tie down and pin his Nf6.} 11. Bg5 Bd6 {Meanwhile, Carl completes his development.} 12. Nb5 {Trying to get a pawn back, I go on the offense by attacking a7.} a6 {As expected, Carl goes on the offense.  I had thoughts about exchanging his Bd6.} 13. Nc3 {But, I decided otherwise, since my N is more active then his Bd6.} h6 {He then attacks my B.  I was on the fringe between whether to exchange his Nf6 or not.  I normally wouldn't since my Bg5 is more active.} 14. Bxf6 {?! But, I also remember Jack telling me that if you let the N in too far, it could be dangerous.  The real question is when that applies.  I thought it did here because I was concerned about 14...Ng4 which attacks my h2 pawn twice, whereas it's only defended once.  However, I also moved a little too quickly here, for had I given this a little more thought, I would've realized that if 14...Ng4, I can then attack with 15.h3  So, exchanging was the wrong decision here.} gxf6 15. Rfe1 {So, I come up with a new plan and go after his e6 pawn.  My plan is hoping he advances that pawn to allow 16.Nxd5 winning a pawn and attacking another.  But, Carl finds a very good answer to that on his next move.} h5 16. Re3 {Preparing to attack f6.  But, I also had thoughts of doubling up, so I was thinking along the lines of 17.Rae1 but didn't think that it would get anywhere, this time around.} Rdg8 {Trying to target my g2 pawn.  } 17. Rf3 {But, before that happens, I go on the offense, as noted above, keeping in mind that he has doubled pawns.} f5 {But, spots it and defends accurately.} 18. Re1 {And, I put pressure on his center, keeping in mind that if he advances it, I've got 19.dxe5, and he can't take back without losing his Bd6.  The idea was trying to trick him into doing that which would allow me to isolate his pawn.  But, he figured out and said, "Wait a minute."} h4 {And, after a few seconds he plays this.  I know that I'm now in more then a little bit of trouble.  As he's threatening 19...h3 which is very serious.  I gave some thought on what to do.} 19. Rh3 {And, I try to stop it with this move.} Rg4 {But, Carl had an answer to that.} 20. Ree3 {? So, I try to bring up more reinforcements to defend the same square that Carl's attacking.  But, this loses now, as he's about to win a pawn and break open the center.  Best was 20.g3, but I don't think this would've saved me though, since his h4+Rg4+Bd6 are all attacking h2.  In other words, he has too many attackers, and I don't have enough defenders.} Rxd4 21. Red3 {Doing what I can to save myself, I now attempt to liquidate his Rd4 so that, he can't use that with his other material.  But, this won't work due to Carl's next move.  21.Ne2 was a better try, and I had considered that.  It would've wound up better for white, but it wasn't enough to save the game, for sure.} Rg4 22. f3 {?? So, I attack, this way.  Of course, Carl has a very good answer to that.  And, I think that this loses because of what's to come later on.  } Rg5 23. Ne2 {But, I guard, at once, with this move.  My goal is also to bring this N to a stronger outpost, at some point.  However, it's not going to end up that way now.} Rhg8 {As Carl doubles up.} 24. g4 {? Having said that, I try to defend my pawn by advancing.  Of course, I'm hoping that Carl will capture en-pessant to allow 35.Nxg3.  But, this is when Carl takes his time, about a minute to answer, as he considered doing that.  However, he captured with the f5 pawn which leaves me worse off.  For me, it was the same idea of Hope Chess, in hopes that he would be distracted and not see this move.  As after we exchange, I'll wind up losing another pawn, to say the very least.} fxg4 25. fxg4 Rg5xg4+ 26. Kh1 {I also considered 26.Kf1, but I wanted to bring my monarch to the corner where I thought it would be safer.  But, better was 26.Kf1.  On the other hand, there are, unfortunately, no good moves left for me.} Rg4g2 {As Carl goes after my Ne2, but if I move, he'll mate me.  } 27. Rd2 {So, I thought that this was the only way to save white, but I was wrong because of Carl's next move, as we must also keep in mind that my Ne2 is now indirectly pinned.} Bf4 {With that being said, he goes right after my R, and there's no way to save it.  Although, I thought there was.} 28. Nxf4 {?? And, I take it.  What I was hoping for was 28...Rxd2, to allow 29.Rxh4 ending some of the dangers as I wouldn't be threatened by that pawn.  But, he has passed pawns which are overwhelming.  However, that wasn't his plan as finds a better move, which mates, at once.} Rg2g1# {And, it's this move.  Carl said that he was waiting for me to take his N so that he can mate.  But, even if I didn't fall for that, he would've gotten my R, so I was lost, no matter what.  The reason being is that I would've resigned, otherwise, so that would be, upon taking the R.  This means that I would've lost just as quickly had I not overlooked the mate.  I think that my decisive mistake was 23.f3?? shutting off the connection with my R's which allowed him to take advantage and use that opportunity to force a win, like this.  And, with that, my score is now 0-1 since this was the first of several tournament games.}
