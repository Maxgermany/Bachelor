1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nbd2 Bd6 5. Ne5 {All pretty standard so far. } Nc6 6. e3 Nd7 {White can go for the normal line, with Nd2-f3, or...} 7. Qg4 {The fun begins here. } g6 {Now black has a ready made reaction: Qf6. } 8. Bg5 {Looking for complications. } Ncxe5 {Just losing central pawns, or...} 9. Qh4 {? Bad move. } f6 {Obvious. } 10. Bh6 {A weak compensaiton for the piece. } Nf7 11. Bg7 {If the Rmoves, Qxh7. Maybe the sac was not completely unsound.} g5 12. Qh5 {Black fails to find the right way: now the N is pinned. } Ke7 {Not more scratches I can see, so I cash in. } 13. Bxh8 Qxh8 {My position doesn't compensate for the piece. } 14. Bd3 f5 15. O-O-O Nf6 {End of my queen's journey. } 16. Qe2 {-1. It could be worse, but it's not the right way to play the opening for white. } Bd7 {Both sides are cramped and slow. Black's impressive center will be hard to break. } 17. f3 {Some space control, please!} c5 18. c3 {Of course, I am playing this to make room for my lsb, but is not my intention to move the c3 pawn from there. } cxd4 {? Black wants to open my queenside, but he is opening my e file!} 19. exd4 Rc8 20. Bxf5 {In a move I will force black to defend. An unusual position. } Nh6 {The B has a good diagonal, but currently I need it pressing on e6. On the other side, after Bh3 black has g4. But that will help me, in fact. } 21. Bh3 g4 22. fxg4 Ba4 {? Helping me. Nxg4 is impossible. } 23. Rde1 {Pressuring e6, and threatening the g5 fork. } Qg8 {Defending e6, but not...} 24. g5 {Can you believe it? I will recover the piece, and with a strong attack. But I didn't see that far as my opponent. } Rxc3+ {!! I could have tried to resist with Kb2, Qg6+, Ka1. But I didn't see it on time!} 25. bxc3 Ba3+ 26. Kb1 Qg6+ 27. Ka1 {No mate?} Bb2+ {!! Very nice. My next's is forced. } 28. Kxb2 Qc2+ 29. Ka1 {Maybe better was Ka3. } Qxc3+ {This was the whole point I missed. } 30. Kb1 {Forced. } Bc2+ 31. Kc1 {Forced. } Bd3+ 32. Kd1 {Forced. } Qc2# {A wonderful counterattack. +7 and losing. Very well played, falconet! Your mate was very sound. }
