1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {Another Anti-Sicilian move that makes my flesh crawl.  Fortunately, Gameknot has given me plenty of practice against such moves.  This is, of course, the venerable old Closed Sicilian.} Nc6 {I've found that an immediate attempt at fianchettoing fails to 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4, when Black's kingside looks sick, so Black can't take on d4 after 2...g6 and White has the advantage.} 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 e6 {Creating room for ...Ne7 and preparing ...d5} 6. f4 {?! creating a weakness on the a7-g1 diagonal} Nge7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. Be3 b6 9. e5 {restricting Black's fianchettoed bishop and releasing White's own} d5 {more or less forcing White to exchange it, else ...d4 forking B & N.  Of course White could move the B or N straightaway but he hasn't castled yet and I think he was loath to disobey opening principles: "never move a piece twice in the opening unless you have to"} 10. exd6 e.p. Qxd6 11. O-O {putting the K on the weak diagonal} Bb7 {opposing White's fianchettoed B, with long-term thoughts of mate on g2 or h1} 12. Kh1 {?  I couldn't see the point of this at all, as this diagonal is potentially as weak as the black one.} Nd4 {?! Perhaps premature.  At the time I wished I'd played ... Nf5 first.} 13. Bxd4 cxd4 14. Ne4 Qc7 {out of range of any N attacks} 15. Rf2 Nf5 16. Rc1 Ne3 {! a lovely square, planning to remove the Bg2 forthwith or hang around being a nuisance.  At this point I was rather pleased with my position and felt that I'd won the opening.} 17. Qe1 Rac8 {Now I decided not to take on g2 immediately but to increase the pressure on c2 by developing my last piece.  White can't try to swap the c-pawn for the d-pawn because of the back-rank capture.} 18. Bh3 {the bishop escapes the N's attentions but that's one less piece on the long diagonal...} h6 {When I shift the Ne4 with ...f5, I don't want it going to g5 and attacking my weak Pe6} 19. Kg1 {This definitely looks the safer diagonal now but ...} f5 20. Ned2 Qc6 {! direct and to the point.  White's Nf3 can't move because of ...Qh1#} 21. Nf1 Ng4 {hoping for 22. Bxg4 fxg4 23. Nf3d2 Qh1# but not expecting it ...} 22. Bg2 Nxf2 {oh well, I'll take what's on offer then ...} 23. Qxf2 {now my position gradually deteriorates as White purposefully improves the positions of his pieces and I fail to find a constructive plan, faffing about with my Rooks, creating easily met threats and defending one at a time against his threats.  I do gain 20 minutes on the clock though...} Rfe8 {? dropping the Pg6} 24. Nh4 Qc7 25. Nxg6 Bxg2 26. Kxg2 Qc6+ 27. Kh3 {the King is safe here} Qd5 28. a3 Rc6 29. Nd2 Kh7 30. Nh4 Rec8 31. Nb3 Rf8 {I think I was planning ...e5 here} 32. Re1 Rfc8 33. Re2 {This R is so much better here than it was on c1} a5 34. Nf3 Rd8 35. Ne5 Bxe5 36. Rxe5 Qd7 37. a4 Rd6 38. Qe2 Re8 39. Nd2 Qxa4 {? giving White time to develop a dangerous attack} 40. Nc4 Rc6 41. b3 Qb4 42. Rxf5 {! I hadn't spotted this.  If I had, I wouldn't have played 39...Qxa4?.  } Qe7 43. Rh5 Qg7 44. Rh4 Rec8 45. Ne5 Rc6xc2 {? not exactly relevant.  45...Rc5 would have helped my defence more.} 46. Qe4+ {! For some reason, I'd only considered 46. Qh5.  Considering my earlier obsession with the long diagonal, this was gross negligence on my part!} Kh8 {now 47. Rxh6 , planning Nf7  forking the Q on h6 fails because Qxh6 gives check.} 47. Rg4 Qf6 48. Ng6+ Kg7 49. Ne5+ Kh8 {and, short of time, White offered the draw, which I gladly accepted.  Both teams gathered round the table like vultures to pick the bones clean and prove that White had a forced win.  Our Board 3 said that if I'd been White I would have found it, but I'm not so sure... Can you find it?}
