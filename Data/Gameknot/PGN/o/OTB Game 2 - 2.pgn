[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Scandinavian variation"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual.} Nf6 {But, this move comes to show that when you're used to something or think you're getting used to it, something else occurs.  As Carl goes right on the attack in the center.} 2. Nc3 {And, I defend this way being that this also develops.} e5 {And, this is how he responds.  I'm not surprised since this also develops and prepares him to castle.  But, Carl is starting to take me into unfamiliar territory.} 3. Nf3 {So, I try to turn this into the Four N's game by bringing the other N.  Of course, that would only work if Carl answers with 3...Nf6.} d5 {But, he takes me into unfamiliar territory with this move.} 4. Nxe5 {Not knowing what else to do, I decide to capture right in the center.  And, when Carl recaptures...} dxe4 5. Bc4 {I threaten 6.Nxf7.  Of course, I know that Carl won't allow it, but it appeared to be a difficult threat to drive off.  I thought that the only way to do that would've been 5...Qe7, with which I'd defend and use that time to castle.  Therefore, my goal wasn't to win material, but I really wanted was to force Carl into breaking the General Opening Guidelines where I'd be ahead in things like development and control of the center.} Be6 {But, I was wrong.  As Carl played.  I asked myself what I could do to avoid exchanging.  } 6. Bxe6 {I thought that no matter where I went, even back b5, it couldn't be avoided.  I thought that my only options were 6.Be2 or 6.Bf1.  Well, I didn't like 6.Be2 because that appears to cram my B and limit the mobility, and I didn't want to undevelop.  I also felt that I could just take away Carl's weakest pawn and put his K at risk of exposure.  But, I was too stubborn and pesstimistic, for had I given it a little more time and thought, I would've noticed that 6.Bb3 would've been a good escape square.  And, it certainly would've been better then exchanging, as I just traded off my good B for his bad one.  However, I was little impatient here.  As I was also a little cranky because my sleep was broken up every 1-1.5 hours.  Having woken up that many times during the night negatively affected my concentration after the last game for the tournament.  Being a little tired and cranky, there was some Flip Coin Chess starting here.    } fxe6 7. O-O {Of course, I was going to get right to business by castling.} Qd4 {And, Carl goes right after my N which I defend and threaten to exchange.  That's what I want here since this is his good N for my bad one.} 8. Ng4 e3 {But, Carl has a different plan of promoting the passed pawn.  Looks harmless, but what he's doing is dangerous.} 9. Nxf6+ {So, I take off his good N.  I normally wouldn't have exchanged, but I had enough of a reason to do it here.  As I was worried about Carl bringing his N to g4 followed by his Q to f5 where mate would be threatened.  So, I stop it here, and in the aftermath of exchanging, I wind up winning a pawn.} Qxf6 10. dxe3 Bd6 {But, Carl is starting a threat which I am determined to stop.} 11. e4 {So, threaten to fork, but Carl stops that with his next move and threatens mate.} Qe5 12. g3 {So, I give my, "King air to breathe" as Jack Stockel puts it.} O-O {Like me, Carl wants to castle.  But, with this move, being that the f pawn advanced, I'll try to find a way to expose his K.} 13. Bf4 {I start by hitting his Q.  But, when he defends, I bring my B back to avoid exchanging since being impatient earlier was wrong.  It's worth noting that 6.Bxe6 was the only time where a rough night affected me for this game.} Qf6 14. Bd2 Nc6 {Not surprisingly, Carl completes his development.} 15. Re1 {? And, I centralize my R as I threaten a fork that would be effective, this time around.  But, this is an oversight that will allow Carl to win a pawn back with an intermediate check.  That R should've remained on f1, where I'd remain a pawn up.  } Qxf2+ 16. Kh1 Rad8 {I'm not sure why Carl played, but I believe that his intention was to put pressure on my Q.} 17. Rf1 {But, I will have none of that, for the time being.} Qc5 18. Re1 {And, I try to put pressure on his K side, instead.  } Be5 {But, Carl stops that by threatening an exchange.} 19. Na4 {So, I go on the offense.} Qc4 {As does Carl.  But, I'm gonna attack again with my next move.} 20. b3 Qb5 21. c4 Qa6 {As now, I have a solid pawn chain from a2-c4.  That was also the idea behind attacking the Q.} 22. b4 {?? I keep going for it.  I also didn't overlook that Carl was going to take.  In fact, I handed the R intentionally, as I thought that if he took it, I'd not only fork, but his Q would be trapped.  But, this loses, as there was a terrible miscalculation.  As Kenneth_fiore_3 mentioned in our first training, I should've calculated through those lines and looked at everything, but id didn't happen here.  I only calculated up to where I thought that I was winning his Q, but missed one move that kept it protected which is how I lost.  Similarly, a GM once lost by missing a move, as Jack Stockel mentioned.} Bxa1 23. b5 {As these moves were my plan.  But, Carl's next move is not what I was ready for and where I realized that 22.b4?? was the losing move.} Rxd2 {What I didn't realized that my Q would be attacked as well, so this move took me off guard.  I also don't have a lot of options.  If I don't liquidate Q's, Carl will pick up my N or the a2 pawn.  So, the Queen's must come off of the board.  But, I know that Carl has a winning edge which he'll exploit, sooner or later.} 24. bxa6 Rxd1 25. Rxd1 Bf6 {Protecting his B.  But, knowing that I can't go wrong anywherelse and with nothing else left, I play the man, as opposed to, the board, as I learned from archduke_piccolo.} 26. axb7 {As I now threaten to promote.  Not surprisingly, Carl will stop it with his next move, but I have a plan.} Rb8 27. Rb1 {As I bring my R behind my passed pawn which is, generally, what you want to do.} Na5 {However, Carl attacks it twice.} 28. Nc5 {Likewise, I defend a second time.} Bd4 {But, Carl removes the defender.  There's really not much left for white.} 29. Na6 {So, I attack his R.  I also could've brought my R up to b5 and prepared to exchange.  But, I didn't want to liquidate, in this position, since I am behind.  Of course, that would've been better then losing another pawn which is about to happen.} Rxb7 30. Rd1 {So, I attack his B, instead.  And, I am prepared for Carl's next move.} Bb6 31. c5 {Thinking that it was trapped, I played this move.  I'm trying to outsmart and pull a swindle against Carl.  But, it's not going to work.} Nc4 {As Carl defends the B.  I could take here, but if I do that, his a and c pawns will be killers, as he'll connect one.  And, that will give black a pawn chain which will be a much easier win for black.  Well, I'm trying to make it very difficult for him.} 32. Rd8+ {So, the next plan starts with this move as I am trying to trick Carl into a draw by repetition just like how tombulous started doing.  Though, I lost with a miscalculation.  But, I'm trying the same techniques.} Kf7 33. Rd7+ {And, the plan continues here, as I'm trying to trick him into playing 33...Kg8 so that the same position occurs 3 times which would force the draw.} Kg6 {Not surprisingly, Carl refuses to carve in.  So, I go to plan C.} 34. c6 {Rather then take the B and allow killer passed pawn, I keep Carl's pawns isolated by attacking his R, instead.  As the R is trapped, but Carl has a ready answer.} Ne5 {As he attacks my pawn.  So, I liquidate right away to avoid the loss of another pawn.} 35. cxb7 Nxd7 36. b8=Q {But, not being able to find a good move, I promote.  My thinking is that I'd win material.  As after he takes, I'll recapture which appears to compensate for lost material.  However, looks can be deceiving, and I'm in for a rude awakening.  In fact, Carl planned this because of what's about to come.} Nxb8 37. Nxb8 c5 {As Carl now has a passed pawn that he's pushing.} 38. Nd7 {Doing whatever's left, given that the B is guarding the pawn, I felt that there's no choice but to attack it.  Of course, Carl's not bothered by this since he's ahead.  In fact, he keeps pushing his passed pawn.} c4 39. Nxb6 {But, since the B is no longer that pawn, I was, at least, gonna try and hold off his pawn.} axb6 40. Kg1 {I do this by attempting to centralize my K, of course, I plan my next move when he pushes it further.  As I was hoping to get there before Carl promotes.} c3 41. Kf2 c2 {But, this is where I realized that it's too little, too late.  Even I centralize, Carl will promote.  And, he has other pawns surrounding the K, while I don't have a passed pawn.  So, I resigned as there's nothing else that I can do.}
