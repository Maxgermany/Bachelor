1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  As you are no doubt aware, I have been falling victim to several pin motifs lately.  However, I do remember that I did take full advantage of a pin in this game.  This is against my buddy Steve.  Steve has come on really well over the past year or so and has got his rating up from the 1500s to the mid-high 1700s and has floored me with a couple of overload tactics in a couple of my games, and as black in Dynamic_dv's Training Tournament broke through my Joblock with disastrous results for me - so I did get a little revenge here!  Steve starts off with the Reti Opening which is 1. Nf3.} d5 2. d4 Nf6 {2. ...... Nf6 - these are fairly standard moves in the Reti Opening which transposes into a QP opening.} 3. c4 c6 4. Nc3 dxc4 {4. ........ dxc4 - in fact this opening has transposed into a kinda QGA deferred with my last move!} 5. e3 b5 {5. ...... b5 - knits the queenside pawns together.  This is undermined by Steve hitting out with 6. a4.} 6. a4 b4 7. Na2 {7. Na2 - this knight retreats to a2 and twice attacks my b4 pawn.  My c4 pawn is also under fire so Steve regains his pawn next move with 8. Bxc4.} e6 8. Bxc4 Nbd7 9. Bd2 a5 {9. ...... a5 - to avoid dropping a pawn now, I must support my advanced b4 pawn.  Incredibly this pawn will survive right down to the final position!} 10. Nc1 Bb7 11. Nb3 {11. Nb3 - putting pressure on my a4 pawn and eyeing up the c5 square for a possible invasion later on.} Be7 12. O-O O-O {12. ....... 0-0 - both sides castle.  This position seems a bit of a log jam and it looks like jstevens1 is yet again faced with her nemesis - passivitis, but next move this changes a bit.} 13. Qe2 c5 {13. ........ c5 - with a pawn break.} 14. Rfd1 Qb6 {14. ...... Qb6 - yet another defensive assignment for Glenda, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear!} 15. Be1 Rac8 16. Rac1 Rfd8 {16. ........ Rfd8 - not much better to do than to oppose rooks on the c and d columns.  Mind you, I am still in the database.} 17. Bb5 {17. Bb5 - this move now triggers off a plethora of exchanges and after the air has cleared Steve and I will have left the database behind and will be in open play in more ways than one.} cxd4 18. Nfxd4 {18. Nfxd4 - first a pawn trade.} Nc5 19. Nxc5 Rxc5 {19. ....... Rxc5 - now one pair of knights.} 20. Rxc5 Bxc5 {20. ........ Bxc5 - now one pair of rooks.} 21. Nb3 Rxd1 22. Qxd1 {22. Qxd1 - now the remaining pair of rooks go back in the box.} Be7 23. Nd4 Qd8 {23. ....... Qd8 - Glenda makes a subtle retreat to her home square - she is doing something now, now you the Inquest Jury, please note the knight on d4, would you say that white has a little problem with it and if so, can you tell me what I am threatening here and why white must do something about it immediately?} 24. Qc2 Be4 {24. ...... Be4 - Steve has seen the threat and moves his queen.  I now decide to improve the position of Fou Leblanc.} 25. Bd3 {25. Bd3?? - this move is a blunder and I am about to take advantage of it Ion Style!  You see, when I have fallen victim to a pin in my games with him, he tends to suck me into it with an exchange or a check beforehand.  Well, here I am doing the same thing to poor Steve!} Bxd3 26. Qxd3 e5 {26. ......... e5 - here it is, one little tiny pawn stab.  I can just imagine Steve logging on and looking at my last move and saying, Ouch!  Yup, I thought it was worth going through this game to drill this motif into my skull so I do not fall for this trick when playing the likes of Coach Ion or the Master Mater.} 27. Qc4 exd4 28. exd4 {28. exd4 - Steve has that pawn for his piece but that pawn on d4 is isolated and it will soon be rounded up.} Nd5 {28. ..... Nd5 - stage 1 - blockade it and keep it on a dark square - note Fou Lenoir!} 29. g3 {29. g3 - creating air for his king.} Bf6 {29. ....... Bf6 - stage 2 - Fou Lenoir now attacks the isolani.} 30. Bd2 Nb6 31. Qb5 {31. Qb5 - this queen move ensures that I have to contend myself with exchanging that d4 pawn with my a5 pawn.  I am also a little concerned with my back row of which is a favourite haunt for Old Matey.  However, where there's a will ........} Bxd4 32. Qxa5 Bxf2+ {32. ........ Bxf2+ - there's a way and there's Fou Lenoir!  This is a pseudo-sac because Glenda can safely nab Steve's dsb with check and have time to do some defensive work for when white gets out of it!  I do end up a clear piece ahead after all!} 33. Kxf2 Qxd2+ 34. Kf1 {34. Kf1? - not very wise going to the back row, I was expecting the WK to go to f3.  Now, Glenda can nab another pawn with check!} Qc1+ 35. Kg2 Qxb2+ {35. .... Qxb2+ - just like this!} 36. Kh3 Qd4 {36. ...... Qd4 - after all that excursion into the enemy camp with p(r)awn booty for her beloved Henry who is partial to seafood she now has a little rest and defends her horse and her footman on b4 who is just a clear 3 squares away from Glendadom.} 37. Qb5 {37. Qb5 - the Wicked Witch of the West is threatening to murder Henry on e1, ssss, but wait, Glenda says, over my dead body!  She now lands a nice little check on d7 and gives her life for the Witch.  I now set up a couple of conditional moves.} Qd7+ 38. Qxd7 Nxd7 39. a5 {39. a5 - Steve tries to crown his passer but my knight retreats to his home square and stops that white footman dead in his tracks ......} Nb8 {39. ...... Nb8 ...... and my own footman can now march unimpeded to Glendadom.  Steve sees this and waves the white flag.  A handy post-Xmas victory!  Hope you have all had a good read - bye for now - Joanne.}
