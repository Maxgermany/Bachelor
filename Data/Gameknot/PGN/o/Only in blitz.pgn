1. e4 {Talk about a game that is totally aggressive on my part.  My king ends the game on e3 of all places :).  With a power all out attack as if one swing could put me away.  No guts no glory right.} c5 2. b4 {I play a good bit of gambits during blitz play.  I think it is mostly because my opponents are not quite prepared and they lead to good fights.} cxb4 3. a3 bxa3 4. Bxa3 {Black fully accepts my gambit.} d6 {Blocking the problems with the dsb.} 5. f4 {Gaining more control over e5.} a6 {weak but prevents Bb5+} 6. d4 {I now have full control of the center however my king is feeling a good bit of air and I have 3 moves to castle.} Nc6 7. c3 {protects d4 and stops checks on a5.} b5 {? black seems to be trying to attack queens side which I have good control over.} 8. Be2 Na5 {? Invites me to b4 with tempo!} 9. Bb4 Nc4 10. Qb3 {Plan being a5 Bxd4.} Ne3 {So many knight moves.} 11. Bxb5+ {!?} axb5 {loses a rook.} 12. Rxa8 Nxg2+ 13. Kf2 {Now my king has no where to hide} Nxf4 14. Ba5 {forcing the queen from the back rank pinning the c8 bishop.} Qd7 15. Nf3 Nh3+ 16. Ke3 {I've now reached e3!} Nf6 17. e5 {Threatening the developed piece.} dxe5 {??} 18. Nxe5 {black is now in real trouble.  Strange with my king on e3 that I would win this game with all these pieces still here.  Guess this would be a good example of why we develop pieces.  I'm fairly certain there are no good moves for black now.} Qb7 {Looses quickly.} 19. Qxf7# {Leave a smile on my face.}
