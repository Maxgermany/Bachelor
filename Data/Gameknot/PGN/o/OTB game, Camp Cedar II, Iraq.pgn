1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 d6 {Blocking development of my dark squared bishop but I (wrongly) felt uncomfortable trading my e-pawn for his d-pawn. White seems to be better here. } 5. Bb5 {Preparing d5 which wins a piece. White has the dynamic advantages (development and initiative) as well as a lead in space. } Bd7 6. Nd5 {As far as I can tell this move is completely wrong for the position. It does nothing to compliment White's advantages. } a6 7. Bxc6 Bxc6 {Some of the pressure has been relieved from Black's position. Trading pieces when you have less space (as Black does in this position) is generally considered a good thing. Now Black has pressure on White's center and is caught up in development. } 8. Nxf6+ Qxf6 9. Bg5 {White missed 9. d5. Black has no Knights so closing the center would have benefited White and gained a tempo as Black's light squared Bishop would have to move to safety. White's move does nothing but force Black's Queen to a better square (g6) which increases the pressure on e4 and indirectly pins White's Knight to the defense of the Bishop. } Qg6 10. O-O {Once again I think that 10. d5 would have been better. } Bxe4 11. Rc1 {This move knocks White out of the game. Once the White Knight is taken Black will win the Bishop and be up a piece. } Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qxg5 13. dxe5 Be7 {Black should have castled to the Queenside. } 14. exd6 cxd6 15. Qxb7 O-O 16. Rfe1 Bf6 17. c3 Qb5 {Trading pieces does nothing but help Black. } 18. Qc7 Be5 19. Rcd1 Qc5 {As pointed out by 'heinzkat,' this move was a mistake for Black.  After 20. Qxc5 ...dxc5   21. Rxe5 Black has lost his material advantage.  Black also is now on the defensive as his c5 pawn is under attack.  } 20. Qe7 Rfe8 {Activates the Rook with tempo. } 21. Qh4 Re6 22. g3 {Opens the light squares to Black's Queen. Could be useful later in the game. } Rae8 23. Re3 Bf6 24. Rxe6 {Trading pieces helps Black, so this move must be considered wrong. } Rxe6 25. Qa4 Qb5 26. Qf4 Be7 27. b4 Qb6 28. a3 Re2 29. h4 Qb5 30. Rxd6 {Another bad trade. This time White doesn't even get even material on his investment. White wanted an opportunity for a back rank mate but Black controls the e8 square twice and has time to advance the h or g pawn. } Bxd6 31. Qxd6 Qe8 32. Qxa6 Re1+ 33. Kh2 h6 {Now Black can stop defending the e8 square and go after the White king. } 34. c4 Qe4 35. c5 {White overlooked mate on h1. } Qh1# {}
