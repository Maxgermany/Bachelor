1. d4 {My first game against a high-rated player } d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. c3 {I'm comfortable with the opening I play here... I know it blocks my dark-square bishop but it makes for solid development for me} c6 4. Bd3 Nbd7 5. Nd2 e5 6. e4 {I make a break from my usual development to stop Black's pawn chasing my bishop away... plus if I play my usual move (Ngf3) the pawn would fork the bishop and knight} exd4 {Does this does good for B's centre control?} 7. cxd4 dxe4 8. Nxe4 Be7 9. Nf3 {resume my normal pace of developing} O-O 10. O-O Nxe4 11. Bxe4 Nf6 12. Re1 {defending} Nxe4 13. Rxe4 {I feel I'm playing pretty well at this point, given the rating difference...} Bf6 14. Qd3 {Then I do this.... This would be the losing move for White} Bf5 {My rook is lost!} 15. Nd2 Bxe4 {The one-rook advantage for Black will work for him at the endgame} 16. Nxe4 Qxd4 17. Qxd4 {I felt the exchange was better than having him chase me around with that queen} Bxd4 18. Bf4 Rfe8 19. Nd6 {White's knight chases the rook around for awhile} Re7 20. Nf5 Re4 21. Bd6 {considered moving the bishop to c7 to lure the rook out to c8, then I could make the knight pin the king and rook... but of course, there's Black's 2nd rook} Bxb2 {I was focussing on the top part of the board too much - I didn't see this coming} 22. Rd1 {b1 would have been better, making Black's bishop retreat, at the very least, and place a threat on Black's b7 pawn (to me at this point, any piece won is good) but then again, I'd have to move one of my kingside pawns before I attacked (mate with rook)} g6 {would knight to g3 have been better?} 23. Ne7+ Kg7 24. f3 Re6 {my knight is lost here... with this move, plus Black's queenside pawns (which could easily be advanced to a pawn promotion) I resign.}
