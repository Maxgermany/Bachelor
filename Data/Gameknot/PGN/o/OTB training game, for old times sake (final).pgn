1. d4 {let's see, how he has done against d4: in the past 20 years...} d5 {probably best: battle it out, in the center rightaway...} 2. c4 {the only logical continuation: the Queens' Pawn Gambit...} Nf6 {Queens' Gambit declined...} 3. Nc3 {all theory: after dxc4, e4, White wins the opening...} e6 {blocking the LSB diagonal, but opening the DSB diagonal...} 4. a3 c5 {a clever response...} 5. dxc5 Bxc5 6. b4 Bxf2+ {for some reason, I was not surprised: exactly the kind of gamble, I would take...} 7. Kxf2 Ng4+ 8. Kg3 e5 {going to the limit: luckily for White. Qg5 is prohibited...} 9. h3 Nf6 10. Nf3 {White has restored the order: for now; the White King is in a bad place...} Nh5+ 11. Kh2 Nf4 12. Bxf4 exf4 13. Qxd5 {time, White did something about this...} O-O 14. Rd1 {the rest, is plain technics: Black is forced, to cover the Queen with Nc6, or leave the building with Qf6...} Qf6 15. Ne4 Be6 {a last attempt, to develop: but the exchange is lost...} 16. Nxf6+ {ough...} gxf6 17. Qxb7 {losing no time...} Nd7 18. Rxd7 Bxd7 19. Qxd7 Rfd8 20. Qg4+ {nothing, left to save: Black resigned...}
