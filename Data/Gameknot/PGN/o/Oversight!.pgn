1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This is my return challenge against charleshiggie and I lost this one too and within less than 30 moves.  I will now explain just how things all went belly-up.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 {2. ....... g6 - I decided to try a King's Indian here.} 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O {5. ....... 0-0 - I castle quickly all right but my queenside will remain undeveloped for a very long time.} 6. Be3 e5 7. Nge2 c6 8. Qb3 exd4 9. Nxd4 {9. Nxd4 - when looking at the World Database there seemed to be a better percentage in exchanging pawns on d4, but was this a case of do not trust database when it is thin?} Re8 10. O-O-O Qc7 {10 .......... Qc7?? - this is where I go wrong, I overlook Qa3 putting pressure on my backward d6 pawn.  I had decided to deviate from the database.  The alternatives offered were Qe7 or Nbd7.  How well would they have stood up to 11. Qa3 though?  You the jury decide.} 11. Qa3 d5 12. cxd5 cxd5 13. Ndb5 {13. Ndb5!! - this zwizchenzug is a crusher!} Qd8 14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. Rxd5 Bd7 {15. ........ Bd7 - I start developing my queenside but Frere Leblanc is pinned.} 16. Nd6 Bf8 17. Qc3 Bxd6 18. Rxd6 Qc8 {18. ...... Qc8 - I see Old Matey's shadow descend on g7.  White's dsb could go to h6 next move trapping Henry on g8 with the Wicked Witch dealing the death blow next move after that.  So Glenda pins her and at the same time makes Frere Leblanc a free man.} 19. Bc4 Be6 20. Bxe6 Qxc3+ 21. bxc3 fxe6 22. Rhd1 {22. Rhd1 - after a plethora of exchanges white doubles rooks on the d file with deadly effect.} Nc6 23. Rd6d7 Rab8 {23. ......... Rab8 - A desperate bid to avoid going further down on material but it is only a matter of time.} 24. Bf4 e5 25. Bh6 Re7 26. Rxe7 Nxe7 27. Rd7 Nc6 {27. ....... Nc6 - I manage to avoid the dreaded double rooks on my second rank but I will very soon be in a zugzwang, next move in fact.} 28. Bg7 a6 29. Bf6 {29. Bf6 - it is here that I throw in the sponge as there is no way of avoiding further material loss and my pieces are hopelessly tied up.  A sorry tale!  Joanne}
