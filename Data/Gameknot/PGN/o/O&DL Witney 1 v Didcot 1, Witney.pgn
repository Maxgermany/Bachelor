1. e4 {This game was over very quickly.  I underestimated the danger to my uncastled king when I tried attacking too soon.  My 11 yr old opponent quickly showed me the error of my ways. } c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O b5 {So far, so standard.  My main alternatives at this stage were .... 0-0, ....Nbd7 and ....Nc6.  I chose this because I wanted to pin the e4 pawn against White's Q as quickly as possible and follow up with an attack on the Nc3. } 10. a3 {At the time, I felt that this was an over-cautious response from White.  It gives Black time to catch up a little on development.  In retrospect it was a good move as it inhibited Black's scope for counter-attack. } Bb7 11. Bd3 {Having delayed the development of this B, White now uses it to reinforce e4, enabling his Q to move and therefore enabling a future pawn advance and/or attack on g7. } Nbd7 12. Qg3 Nc5 {I have had some nasty experiences castling on either side in this sort of position.  However, I think I should have castled before playing this thrust as I soon fall prey to a devastating exploitation of my weak kingside. } 13. e5 Nxd3+ {I wanted to set up an attack on White's king as soon as possible.  This move started to clear the c-file for heavy piece action and removed one of the key defenders of c2, also allowing me to respond to White's attack on my KN with another attacking move. } 14. Rxd3 Ne4 15. Nxe4 Bxe4 16. Re3 {I thought this was a wasted move, as I'd expected the annoying 16. Rc3 } d5 {I was rather pleased with this establishment of the e4 outpost for my B but I'd overlooked something ... } 17. Rc3 {Now that Black has cut off his own B from its defence of the White squares on the Q-side, White lays claim to the c-file. } Qb7 18. Bxe7 {With this exchange, White starts to break open Black's precarious position. } Kxe7 {I preferred this to taking with the Q as it enabled me to connect my Rooks. } 19. Qxg7 {Not just pawn-pinching but starting the final demolition. } Rhg8 {This fails to budge the Q and fails to prevent White's next move. } 20. Nc6+ {Black exploits the weak white squares and wins more material. } Ke8 {Alternative variation: 20... Qxc6 21. Qf6+ Ke8 ( 21... Kd7 22. Qxf7+ Kd8 23. Rxc6 ) 22. Rxc6  } 21. Qxg8+ {White goes a rook up with mate to follow shortly, so I resigned. }
