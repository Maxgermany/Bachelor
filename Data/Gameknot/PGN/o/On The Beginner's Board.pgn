1. d4 {Hi everyone!  For the first ten moves you could be forgiven for thinking that the player with the black pieces was the beginner here, until you look at that number against black's name and then what happened after white's 12th move.  Yup, it certainly looked as though I was heading for a real slip on the banana skin.  Thankfully I managed to turn things around.  White kicks off with d4 and I respond with the popular Nf6.} Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Be3 {3. Be3 - unusual development - blocks in white's e2 pawn.} Nc6 4. h4 {4. h4 - hmm, has he seen a few of my games against The Master Mater and decided to try and emulate him?} e5 {4. ..... e5 - pawn break.} 5. dxe5 Nxe5 {5. ........ Nxe5 - pawn trade.} 6. Bd4 Ned7 {6. ........ Ned7 - trying to avoid a pawn bust up on the kingside.} 7. Qd3 {7. Qd3 - now here comes that Wicked Witch of the West, ssss!} c6 {7...... c6 - I give my d5 pawn some back up but white has something up his sleeve .....} 8. Qe3+ {8. Qe3+ - first up a queen check .....} Qe7 9. Bxa7 {9. Bxa7 - it begins to dawn on me, ouch, that a7 pawn was only defended once and attacked twice!  I got that real horrid sinking feeling once before, about 11 or 12 years ago when, helping out at a kiddies chess club I blundered my queen to a six year old beginner.  My gut feeling told me to play on and I eventually won but boy did it not take me about what seemed an eternity to compose myself!  Thankfully I lost only a pawn, so I transformed myself from Jo Pessimist to Jo Optimist!} Qxe3 10. Bxe3 Bb4 {10. ....... Bb4 - I looked very carefully at the board and slowly a seed began to germinate in the thick grey matter between my ears.  I may at least bust up his queenside pawn structure here.  Little did I know my opponent was about to give me another Christmas bonus.} 11. a3 Ne4 {11. ....... Ne4 - I think I can win back a pawn here, but .......} 12. axb4 {12. axb4??} Rxa1+ {12. ........ Rxa1+ - I net the EXCHANGE!  I am now one point up in material and not down.  White has only one legal move - Nd1.} 13. Nd1 Ndf6 {13. ..... Ndf6 - I improve the placement of my d7 knight and unblock the c8-h3 diagonal for Fou Leblanc.} 14. Nf3 Ng4 {14. .... Ng4 - soon I will be a clear exchange up.} 15. h5 Ngxf2 16. Bxf2 Nxf2 17. Kxf2 Rxd1 {17. ....... Rxd1 - such as now.} 18. Rh4 O-O {18. ...... 0-0 - my development is almost complete, only Fou Leblanc is at home - he will be there for quite a few moves yet though.} 19. g3 Re8 20. Rf4 Re4 21. Rxe4 dxe4 {21. ...... dxe4 - rook trade.} 22. Ne5 Rd2 23. Nc4 Rxc2 {23. ..... Rxc2 - more material drops off.} 24. Nd6 Bg4 25. Nxe4 Rxb2 {25. ...... Rxb2 - pawn trade.} 26. Nd6 Rxb4 {26. ........ Rxb4 - another white pawn drops off and I now have two footmen who will both march all the way to Glendadom.} 27. Bg2 Bxh5 {27......... Bxh5 - and another.} 28. Nf5 Kf8 29. Nd6 Rb2 30. Nc4 {30. Nc4 - white tries to be as active as possible but overlooks the fact that his e2 pawn is en prise - that too will drop off.} Rxe2+ 31. Kg1 b5 {31. ...... b5 - veni, vidi, vici!} 32. Na5 c5 33. Bf1 Rb2 34. Bd3 Be2 35. Bxe2 Rxe2 {35. ...... Rxe2 - bishops are now traded off and I am the exchange and four pawns up, wow, and it gets better .....} 36. Nb3 c4 {36. .... c4 - white tries in vain to halt those passers.} 37. Nd4 Rb2 38. Nf3 c3 39. Nd4 c2 40. Ne2 Rb1+ {40. ....... Rb1+ - next move my c pawn makes it to Glendadom.} 41. Kh2 c1=Q 42. Nxc1 Rxc1 {42. ..... Rxc1 - only to lose it to the knight, but I am now a Rook and 3 pawns up so I have come off very well out of that deal.  My b pawn now spends the next four moves marching off to Glendadom and this time arrives safely.} 43. Kg2 b4 44. Kf3 b3 45. Ke4 b2 46. Ke5 b1=Q {46. ...... b1/Q - and to a loud fanfare the humble b2 footman becomes a drag queen but as soon as he picks up the black wand he turns into Glenda.  The white king now marches towards Valhalla.} 47. Kd6 Qe4 {47. ...... Qe4 - preparing a Lawnmower Mate/Firing Squad Mate.} 48. Kd7 Qe6+ {48. ...... Qe6+ - it is now mate next move and I set up the conditional move for my rook to deliver mate.  Thankfully I only had a minute to wait.  In fact, only two days later I found myself in a position to annotate another won game which I will call Two against One so watch this space.} 49. Kd8 Rc8# {}
