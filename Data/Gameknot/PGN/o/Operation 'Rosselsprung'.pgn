[Opening "Queen's Gambit (D06)"]

1. d4 {"Rosselsprung" was the codename of a German naval operation in World War Two, in which the battleship "Tirpitz" sortied to intercept an Allied arctic convoy.  The operation was a success for the Germans.  "Rosselsprung" refers to the knight's move in chess.} d5 2. c4 {I had no affinity with the "Kriegsmarine's" interests.  And since my opponent was around 1650, I wanted a good game.} h6 {We have here a queen's gambit declined, with black playing a quick h6.} 3. e3 {I often play this move in queen's gambit variations.  While it does close the dsb's diagonal, I in mind b3 and bb2.  } Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Nf3 {Everything looks to be proceeding normally here.  My last annotated game had been a disaster, and I kept this in mind as I selected my moves.} Be7 6. b3 {Part of the problem in my last game had been that I was failing to see the board.  I had put the blinders on.  "Rosselsprung" would have to be more than just a cheap tactical threat.} O-O 7. Bb2 {And so, I sortied on.  The bishop on b2 looks like it may be good, even though the opening here identifies it as a closed game.} a6 8. Be2 {Later, this move would prove a mistake, as bd3 would have been stronger.} b6 9. cxd5 exd5 10. Qd2 {Another mistake.  I think taking cd is fine, but qc2 or even qd3 was probably better.  Here, it proves to be hemmed in by the pawn chain.} Be6 {I consider this move pretty debatable given the pawn on d5, and white's a2 and b3 pawns.} 11. h3 c5 {Black finally looks to open the board.  In this position I did not mind c4, or cxd.  I decide to castle kingside, even though I often prefer to castle queenside.  I am thinking the rooks will be good on c and d.} 12. O-O Ne4 13. Nxe4 {Maybe I didn't have to take the knight, with qc2.  But after dxe and ne5, bc4 seems possible.} dxe4 14. Ne5 f6 15. Ng6 {Nc4 also appears strong, but white has weakened the light squares around the king, and I wanted to play bh5 to threaten winning the exchange.} Rf7 16. Bh5 Nc6 {nxe7, rxe7 was possible, but black's dsb is not looking like a very good piece.  I think the decision not to take was sound.} 17. Rfd1 {With threats of d5.} Qd5 {Against d5, and threatening qxh5.} 18. Qe2 {Obvious threats of dxc followed by rac1.} Nb4 19. dxc5 {Here I just went ahead and played dxc, since I didn't think the knight on b4 was going to be that great.} Qxc5 20. Nf4 {In this position, rac1 may have been better.  I am threatening to win the exchange, and to take nxe6.  Also, I am defending d3.} Bf5 {He protects against the ne6 threat, but is loosing the exchange.  } 21. Bxf7+ Kxf7 22. Rac1 {In this position, white looks to be doing well. He is ahead in material, has a good knight on f4, has good control of the c and d files, and has a good bishop on b2.  Black, by contrast, is going to have to move his queen to an inactive square, and has a knight with no real prospects now that d3 is stronger for white after nf4.} Qb5 23. Qh5+ {I don't think this move is that bad, although it is admittedly not great.  Black can just play bg6, although this will certainly lead to simplifications.} Kg8 24. Rc7 {Threatening rdd7 after black defends the bishop and the f5 bishop is dealt with.} Nd3 25. Nxd3 Bd6 {Black tries to create complications with this move.} 26. Qf7+ {And white is winning, with qxg7# inevitable.  }
