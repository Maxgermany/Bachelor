1. e4 Nf6 {the Alekhine Defense: always a hard nut for White to crack...} 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg4 5. Be2 {White takes it slowly...} Nc6 6. h3 {we give Black no time for Nb4: after Bxf3, Bxf3, Nb4, just c3...} Bh5 7. g4 Bg6 8. c4 {always a problem in the Alekhine: the Knight losing tempo...} Nb6 {better than Ndb4, Bd2...} 9. Bf4 {profylactic: this is against dxe5...} e6 {Black needs space to castle: this also guards against d4-d5...} 10. Nc3 {nonetheless, White enforces d5: we postpone castling until we know, what Black is up to...} Be7 {preparing castling...} 11. d5 {now or never...} exd5 12. cxd5 Nb4 13. a3 Na6 14. b4 c6 {a logical move: Black makes space for Nc7, after b4-b5...} 15. Bxa6 {but White decides otherwise...} bxa6 16. dxc6 {White has found a leak...} Qc7 {understandably, but careless...} 17. exd6 Bxd6 18. Bxd6 Qxc6 {Black has sacrificed a piece: but that is not the end of it; Nc3, Nf3 and Bd6 are far from safe: after 0-0-0, Black has a mean edge...} 19. Qe2+ {but White finds a hole in the Black defenses...} Kd7 {Ke8 makes not much difference...} 20. Qe7+ Kc8 21. O-O {of course, Qxc3, Rc1 is losing...} Re8 22. Qg5 {White escapes just in time...} Qxd6 {winning the piece back...} 23. Qc5+ {time to swap Queens...} Qxc5 24. bxc5 Nd7 25. Na4 Be4 26. Ng5 Bc6 {all forced...} 27. Nc3 Nxc5 28. Nxf7 {but White comes out better in the trade: Nd6+ is a nasty threat...} Kc7 {connecting the rooks...} 29. f4 {making a bridge head for Nf7...} Re3 {trying to break up Whites' Kings' wing...} 30. Nd1 {only move...} Rg3+ 31. Kf2 {Kh2 loses, after Rg2+, Kh1...} Rxh3 32. Ne5 {just in time to prevent Rf3+...} Nd3+ 33. Nxd3 Rxd3 34. Ne3 {disrupting the rooks' actions...} Re8 35. Rfe1 {forced...} Bb5 {maybe not best: but after Rd2+, Re2, Black gets nowhere too...} 36. Rac1+ Kb6 37. Rcb1 {de Bishop is pinned for now...} Rxa3 {avoiding the lethal a3-a4...} 38. Nc4+ {the winning move...} Kc7 {after Kc6, Rxe8, Black has no Bxe8...} 39. Nxa3 {taking out the right piece...} Rxe1 {preventing Rc1+...} 40. Nxb5+ {taking out the last piece with check...} axb5 41. Kxe1 {and Black resigned...}
