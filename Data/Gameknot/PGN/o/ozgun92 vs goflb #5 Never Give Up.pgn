1. c4 {Anyway, I decide to kick off with a change, instead of my constant e4.} e6 {Does he *always* reply e6?} 2. d4 {Occupying the center. Not quite English, I presume.} d5 {Challenging the center. We have almost a French situation, except that the e4 pawn is on c4.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Bg5 {Pins by both sides, and he castles first. I will have to wait till move 16.} O-O 6. e3 c6 7. Rc1 {I think the idea was not to leave my a-pawn isolated.} h6 8. Bh4 {I love those bishops, and pins are not bad at all!} Nbd7 9. Bd3 Qa5 10. a3 Bxc3+ 11. Rxc3 {The first exchange takes place.} dxc4 12. Bxc4 {Exchange the second.} Qh5 {Temporarily pinning that Knight for the protection, and relocating the Queen.} 13. Bg3 {He had more future there, and this frees the Knight from the defence of the Bishop.} Ne4 {Pressure piles on, as he threatens the Rook and Bishop simultaneously.} 14. Rc2 Nxg3 15. fxg3 {Now I have a central pawn island. It is not falling anytime soon, though.} Nf6 16. O-O Nd5 {Threatening the backward pawn, and a 4rk. (A fork including four pieces)} 17. Bxd5 {I thought that taking the Knight was better than tying one of the big guys to the defence of e3. e4? does not work- he still plays Ne3 and I lose at least the exchange.} exd5 18. Rcf2 {Lining up on the half-open file.} Bg4 {Pressure grows.} 19. h3 {Get off there!} Bxf3 20. Qxf3 Qxf3 {Exchanging off material.} 21. gxf3 {This is the most ?! move of the game. The last game between him and me, I lost due to a wretched pawn structure in the endgame. I thought the best way to go now was to correct my pawns, given the chance. However, a huge drawback is that this move blocks both Rooks. Probably Rxf3 was much better.} Rfe8 22. Re2 {Now he has got his half-open file, and my Rook is going nowhere.} Re7 23. Kf2 {I thought of e4, but if he does not take, my pawn itself gets pinned.} Rae8 24. Rfe1 {Files, files, files.} f5 {maximum control of e4 - mission accomplished} 25. g4 g6 26. gxf5 gxf5 {Still control of e4 - although this move exposes the King, he is not going to stay there anyway.} 27. h4 {Why not Kg3?} Kg7 28. Kg3 Kf6 29. Kf4 {Great. Now I am one move behind.} Rg8 30. e4 dxe4 31. fxe4 {And now that my pawn has left the protection of g4, he can check me and get a pawn.} Rg4+ 32. Kf3 Rxh4 {There he goes.} 33. exf5 Rxe2 34. Rxe2 Rxd4 35. Re6+ {We're going down! That was going to fall anyway, better get the h-pawn in compensation.} Kxf5 36. Rxh6 Rd3+ 37. Ke2 Rb3 38. Kd2 Rxb2+ {At this point, I was already making plans for another challenge. Against another opponent I would have resigned, but in a friendly environment, I decided to give him the honors.} 39. Kc3 {Play a5, leave the Rook, come on! (*uses the force with one hand*)} Rb6 {Far away from danger. :(} 40. Kd4 Ra6 {Threatens Rxa3.} 41. Rh3 {Now that I protect the pawn, he suddenly has other plans:} Ra5 {Such as protecting his King (??) - the losing move after 5 days of a tiresome competition and 16 hours of flight and +/- 10 hours of jet-lag. How else was I supposed to beat him? He offered a draw after this point, which I - so unchivalrously - declined.} 42. Rh5+ Ke6 43. Rxa5 {At this point he asked me "Do you know the King-Rook mating pattern?" and I replied "Yes." He, of course, did not believe it.} a6 {The only way not to lose a pawn immediately.} 44. Kc5 Kd7 45. Kb6 Kc8 {The King is bound for the protection of the backward c7 pawn.} 46. Re5 {And this is the coup-de-grace; a zugzwang! Both pawn moves lose, and moving the King to b8 (??) causes checkmate (Re8#), and moving him away loses the pawns one by one. Very well played until move 41, my friend! Hope you enjoyed :)}
