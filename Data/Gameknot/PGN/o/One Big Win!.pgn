1. Nc3 {Hi everyone!  I have been very quiet recently because I have been concentrating on trying to get my first ever victory against 1900+ opposition.  Thankfully I did manage it - in fact - my opponent, Ger's optimum rating was 1997, just 3 points away from Expertdom, so a big result.  So, how did Jo The Beginner manage to do this and regain her Class A status?  Well, Ger kicks off with 1. Nc3 which is the Dunst Opening, a favourite of Freddy, the Master Mater.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {2. ..... Nc6 - Ger has got both knights out, time to catch up with some equine development of my own!} 3. g3 Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 {5. Nxd4 - pawn trade.  I am tempted to trade knights here but I do not want the Wicked Witch of the West to sit on d4 so I decided to respond with the line-opening e6 - gives Fou Lenoir some air.} e6 6. Bf4 d6 {6. ..... d6 - although this move closes up Fou Lenoir's line temporarily it also shuts out Ger's dsb.  I do not want a knight fork on c7 thank you very much!} 7. Nxc6 bxc6 {7. ...... bxc6 - I am quite relieved therefore to see the back of one of those white steeds.} 8. e4 e5 {8. ....... e5 - now looks more like a double king pawn opening.} 9. Be3 {9. Be3 - a rather strange retreat, opens up the possibility of a pawn fork on d4.  Mind you, my opponent is sure to see it coming.  I decided to clear the way for kingside castling.} Be7 10. f3 Bb7 {10. ...... Bb7 - this diagonal may be very useful for Fou Leblanc and I continue to clear the decks!} 11. Kf2 {11. Kf2 - a strange move here, but maybe Ger wants some flexibility where his king is concerned.} O-O {11. ..... 0-0 - I respond immediately by tucking Henry away on the kingside.  Note that there is a black rook bearing down on the WK on the f column.} 12. Qe1 d5 {12. ..... d5 - suddenly the idea of a pawn fork on d4 is not so remote.} 13. exd5 cxd5 14. Rd1 d4 {14. ...... d4 - I decided to do the fork anyway despite the fact that the pawn is pinned to Glenda.} 15. Bc1 {15. Bc1 - this bishop returns to his home square where he will remain for many, many moves.} Qc7 {15. ...... Qc7 - but Glenda sees a way to win a pawn - a skewer!} 16. Nb5 Qxc2+ {16. ...... Qxc2+ - and takes the pawn with check.  Ger blocks with the Witch and I decided to trade queens as I am now a pawn up, note my d4 pawn is also a passer.  Can I win this from here?  I decided to firmly fix my eyes away from that Offer Draw button.} 17. Qe2 Qxe2+ 18. Bxe2 Bc5 {18. ....... Bc5 - activating Fou Lenoir and threatening to win a piece by d3 discovered check.} 19. Kg2 a6 {19. ...... a6 - after the WK takes evasive action I decided to put a question to the white knight.  He can go to c7 if he wants but Rfc8 firmly traps it!} 20. Na3 Bd5 {20. ..... Bd5 - to counter Bc4.} 21. Bc4 {21. Bc4 - Ger plays it anyway but this is gonna trigger off a plethora of exchanges.  Firstly, I am very reluctant to give up Fou Lenoir for the knight on a3 but this will result in a nullification of a queenside pawn majority.} Bxa3 22. Bxd5 {22. Bxd5 - an intermezzo (in-between move) attacking my rook.  I must now play Nxd5 because if I try and get my rook out of the line of fire with Rad8 for example he can play BxPch and if KxB then PxB regaining his pawn.} Nxd5 23. bxa3 Rac8 {23. ...... Rac8 - threatening Rc2+.} 24. Rd2 Ne3+ {24. ..... Ne3+ - reinforcing the c2 square with check.} 25. Kf2 Rc2 26. Rxc2 Nxc2 {26. ....... Nxc2 - rook trade.} 27. Rd1 Rc8 {27. ...... Rc8 - bolstering the c2 knight.} 28. g4 f6 {28. ....... f6 - reinforcing the e5 pawn and creating some luft for Henry.  Also, Henry will start a Royal Progress very shortly to the middle of the battlefield.} 29. h4 Kf7 30. Ke2 Ke6 31. h5 Kd7 {31. ...... Kd7 - I get a sudden attack of the passivitis but I do not want white's rook to make ingress into my position via the b column.} 32. Rd3 {32. Rd3 - that rook is heading for the b column, I must stop this.} Rc3 33. Rxc3 dxc3 {33. ...... dxc3 - with another rook trade but can I protect my isolated passer on c3?} 34. Kd3 Nd4 {34. ..... Nd4 - Ger can take the pawn on c3 if he wishes but then my horsie will take on f3, giving me a new passer on e4 and maintaining a clear 1 pawn advantage.} 35. f4 c2 {35. ...... c2 - so he does not take my c pawn.  I therefore advance it to one square away from Glendadom.  This will tie down his king and dark squared bishop but what can Henry do while this is happening?} 36. Bb2 Ke6 37. a4 {37. a4 - if Bxd4?? then the c2 pawn crowns at once.} g6 38. fxe5 fxe5 {38. ...... fxe5 - pawn trade.} 39. Kd2 Kd5 40. Kd3 gxh5 41. gxh5 {41. gxh5 - another pawn trade.} Ke6 42. Kd2 Kf5 {42. .... Kf5 - Henry decides to make a p(r)awn cracker of the footman on h5.} 43. a5 Kg5 44. Bxd4 c1=Q+ {44. ...... c1/Q+ - Glenda makes a brief appearance, to drag the WK one square up the board and make him lose a vital tempo.} 45. Kxc1 exd4 {45. ...... exd4 - now I take the WB and find myself in a K & P ending, and as you will see, a winning one!!} 46. Kd2 Kxh5 47. Kd3 Kg4 {47. ....... Kg4 - Henry decided to go up the board just in case the WK tries to stop my h pawn from crowning.} 48. Kxd4 h5 49. Kc5 {49. Kc5 - the race is on ......} h4 50. Kb6 h3 {50. ..... h3 - ....... but I think I am gonna win it!} 51. Kxa6 {51. Kxa6 - no doubt Ger felt very happy, two white passers on the a column .......} h2 52. Kb6 h1=Q {52. ...... h1/Q - .... but on the h column there's a big black Queen!} 53. a6 {53. a6 - Ka7 might have been more of a nuisance to me but then Glenda could move in a zig zag fashion, always checking and always moving closer to the WK, as it is she is now permitted to climb on her broomstick and program that satnav of hers to take her to a8 preventing those little footmen from crowning.} Qa8 54. a4 {54. a4 - Ger courageously plays on but Henry now moves in for the kill to f5.} Kf5 55. Kb5 Qa7 56. a5 Ke5 {56. ...... Ke5 - Henry moves ever closer, now Ger must give up the pawn on a6.} 57. Ka4 Qxa6 {57. ...... Qxa6 - before playing this move I analysed a few mates within 6 moves.  Unfortunately there are some variations on them but never fear, Glenda will nail the WK.  Here are the mates I did work out:- Variation A  58. Kb4 Kd4  59. Ka4 Kc4  60. Ka3 Qb5  61. Ka2 Kc3  62. Ka3 Qxa5#   Variation B  58. Kb4 Kd4  59. Ka3 Qxa5+  60. Kb3 Qc3+  61. Ka4 Qb2  62. Ka5 Kc5  63. Ka6 Qb6#   Variation C  58. Ka3 Qxa5+  59. Kb3 Kd4  60. Kc2 Qc3+  61. Kb1 Qd2  62. Ka1 Kc3  63. Kb1 Qb2#  My opponent realised that Old Matey, that chessic Grim Reaper was not too far away and waved the white flag.  Unless Ger can beat al-fiere in his remaining match I will come top in my group of the Sneaky Knight's Team MT - that will be really nice!  Anyhow for now I am content to be back in the Class A ranks even if this only proves to be temporary.  Anyhow, hope you all have a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne}
