[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 e5 {A friendly game with my boss. He's white and opens with the Larsen's Opening. Not a very popular choice for white being the 6th most common first move, and only 1/3 as popular as the 5th most common move, 1. g3 (Benko's Opening) which prepares white's kingside castle. I reply with 1. ... e5, the Modern Variation, looking to establish the center and shut down white's bishop after the fianchetto at b2.} 2. Bb2 Nc6 {The obvious continuations.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {3. Nc3 might not be white's strongest option. It blocks the fianchettoed bishop for little gain, and it also blocks white's c-pawn which might be a valuable attacker should black play a pawn to d4. The main line suggests 3. e3 for white, opening lines for the other bishop and preparing to play a pawn to d4.} 4. d3 Bb4 {Well, I'm out of book moves. Just playing by ear. White offered me the classic knight pin so I take it, relieving a little pressure from d5.} 5. e4 d5 {Fighting for the center.} 6. Nf3 d4 {Choices, choices. Black could have played 6. ... dxe5, 7. dxe5 Nxe5 and won a pawn. In retrospect, that was probably the best line, because then it seems white cannot save his knight on c3. Instead, I play for the simpler approach, winning the pinned knight with a pawn. 6. Nf3? needs a question mark for not defending the position at c3. Oddly, general opening principles say to develop pieces, preferably knights before bishops, and white followed that principle - this was just one of those cases where there was danger on the board that needed to be handled before following general opening principles.} 7. Qd2 dxc3 8. Bxc3 Bxc3 9. Qxc3 Qd6 {Defends the pawn at e5.} 10. O-O-O O-O 11. Be2 Ng4 {Wasting time, really. This attack cannot really go anywhere, and it's not likely that white will allow the knight to remain on g4.} 12. Rdf1 a5 {Time to work on white's castle. It's worth noting that the moves up to this point had been spread out over several days, but both players were online together and played the game to its conclusion from this point forward. Both players were playing fairly rapidly, like one might do in a friendly OTB game, so there's a little bit of slop ahead.} 13. h3 Nf6 14. Rfd1 Qa3+ {Another lame attack. It might allow black to exchange queens, which favors black since he's ahead in material, but it won't go much farther than that.} 15. Kb1 Nb4 16. Qb2 Qxb2+ 17. Kxb2 Nc6 {Queens exchanged, but now the pawn on e4 is in danger, and white is going to drive the knight away from b4 anyway, so I bring it back for defense.} 18. g4 a4 19. bxa4 Rxa4 {White's castle is broken, and his king is exposed.} 20. a3 Be6 {Making room for 21. ... Rfa1.} 21. g5 Nh5 {Now that was a blunder, allowing white to play 22. Nxe5 and win a pawn. That would leave black up by a knight for two pawns, not necessarily a winning advantage. I give 21. ... Nh5? a question mark. I realized this after I submitted the move and sweatted it out for about two minutes while I waited for my opponent to submit his move.} 22. c4 Nf4 {White missed it, so I hurry and get off of h5 with a fork against the white bishop and the pawn at h3.} 23. d4 exd4 {White tried to get tricky, threatening 24. d5 with a pawn fork against black's bishop at e3 and knight at c3. However, white's bishop is still en prise, and black can exchange in the center, making sure that white's knight is not on d4 when black plays Nxe2, thus gaining a piece.} 24. c5 Nxe2 {24. c5?? needs a couple question marks. White's bishop was en prise, but he failed to save it. Black was up by one piece, not enough material to guarantee a win, but enough to probably win. After 24. c5??, black is up two pieces and now has an easy win, especially with a passed pawn, an with white's broken queenside pawn structure and exposed king.} 25. g6 fxg6 {25. g6? gets another question mark, sacrificing a pawn for no gain, isolating the h-pawn, and allowing black to open the f-file with a direct attack against white's exposed knight on f3.} 26. Rhe1 Rxf3 27. Rxe2 Rxh3 {The pawns on a3 and h3 were both available for the taking, but clearing the h3 pawn gives black a passed pawn on the h-file.} 28. f4 Bg4 {28. f4? gets another question mark. Black now wins the exchange. Already behind by two pieces and two pawns, white cannot afford any exchanges, especially exchanging his powerful rooks for lesser pieces.} 29. Rde1 Bxe2 30. Rxe2 Rhxa3 {Doubling rooks on the a-file, and planning 31. ... Ra2.} 31. Rc2 Ra3a2+ {Multiple threats. White cannot play 32. Kb3??? because that loses instantly to 32. ... Na5# nor can he play 32. Kb1?? for black continues 32. ... Ra1  33. Kb2 Ra4a2  34. Kb3 Na5  35. Kb4 Rxc2 36. e5 Rb1  37. Ka3 Nc4  38. Ka4 Ra2#} 32. Kc1 Rxc2+ {White played the only move that keeps him alive for a while longer and black, seeing no way to drive the king away from the white rook, decides on simple liquidation, exchanging white's only remaining piece.} 33. Kxc2 Rc4+ {Not really necessary, but black wants his rook on e3, and a little detour to rid white of one of his pawns can't hurt.} 34. Kd2 Rxc5 35. Kd3 Rc3+ {Black plans 36. Kd2 (not 36. Ke2? allowing 36. ... Re3 ) followed by 36. ... Re3 to eliminate white's passed pawn. If 37. e5, then 37. ... Nxe5, 38. fxe5 Kf2, followed by black's king taking white's last pawn and continuing onward for a king rook vs. king endgame. Instead, white chose to resign so we can start another game.}
