1. e4 {I'm still learning how to respond to 1.)e4, e5  Any feedback you can give is appreciated!!} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The oh so popular Lopez.} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 {This seemed solid enough. Perhaps Nc3 was another option. I also considered Qe2, but to move the queen so early seems suspicious.} b5 6. Bb3 Be7 {I thought Bc5 would have been a better response, but this looks fine as well. I know the DSB on e7 can defend the king well by going to f8.} 7. O-O O-O 8. Nc3 {I was afraid of d5.} d6 9. h3 {Preparing Be3, and stoping Ng4 and Bg4.} Na5 10. Be3 c5 {Black's probably better here. He has space and initiative. } 11. Nd5 {I thought for a while before making this move. If Nxd5, I think I'm fine, because I recapture, then go c4 next turn.} Nxb3 {Not sure about this move. He gets the bishop pair, but I get a more active rook.} 12. Nxe7+ {It's important I take first, as to not mess up my pawn structure in the middle. After seeing what happened in the game, I believe taking the knight is better here. The DSB for black is very passive right now.} Qxe7 13. axb3 d5 {A good move, opening the center when I can't defend comfortably. } 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Re1 {Here, my big problem is that I lack a plan, and am not sure how to improve my position. Mose pawn breaks are going to leave me with severe weakness's. Perhaps d4 could have been tried here, and in all the lines I shouldn't lose a pawn, due to the placement of blacks queen. I came up with a similar concept here soon. I'm struggling to hang on.} Re8 16. Bd2 Qc7 17. d4 {Only now, do I spot the tactic.} e4 18. dxc5 Bb7 19. Ng5 {Maybe Nd4 was an alternative?} e3 20. Bxe3 Nxe3 21. Rxe3 Rxe3 22. fxe3 Qxc5 23. Nf3 Qxe3+ 24. Kh1 Re8 {material is still even, and maybe I can draw if I keep pieces on, since black does have some queenside weakness's, but here, I should be completely lost after my next move.} 25. Qe1 {This should lose, as I don't see a refutation to this endgame.} Qxe1+ 26. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 27. Nxe1 f5 28. b4 Be4 29. c3 {It was here I realized I'm too tied down, and am in serious trouble.} Kf7 30. Kg1 Ke6 31. Kf2 Kd5 32. b3 {To stop Kc4, though Now black can win with Bb1, Ba2, And Bxc3. My opponent did not see this plan.} h6 33. Ke3 g5 34. Kd2 {Perhaps g3 would have been a better move, though if black sees the tactic I mentioned earlier, it doesn't work now.} f4 35. Nf3 {If Bxf3, I should have a fortress, with winning chances, to boot.} Bf5 36. Ne1 Ke4 37. Nd3 {This idea looked interesting, so I thought I'd give it a try. Idea is to go to c5, while I can, and fight for what now is an unclear game.} f3 38. Nc5+ {Nc5+, to gain a temp on the king.} Kf4 39. gxf3 Kxf3 40. Nxa6 Bxh3 41. c4 {The race begins!!} g4 42. cxb5 {This looks ugly, but I liked lines in this more than just pushing, as black can stop me in time.} Kf2 43. Nc5 Bg2 44. b6 h5 45. b5 h4 {Things may look grim, but I had some ideas in mind.} 46. Nd3+ Kf1 47. Ne5 g3 48. Nc6 Bxc6 49. bxc6 g2 50. c7 {I was low on time here, as was my opponent. I believe pushing the B pawn would have been a better choice, so it cannot simply be captured once black promotes.} g1=Q 51. c8=Q Qf2+ 52. Kc3 Qxb6 53. Qc4+ Kg1 54. Qg4+ Kf1 55. Qh3+ Ke2 56. Qxh4 {I'm not to knowledgable with endgames, so I don't know if this is a win or not. If I had to guess, it's probably a draw, but I played on, since I am a pawn up.} Qe3+ 57. Kb4 Qb6+ 58. Ka3 Qc5+ 59. Qb4 Qc1+ 60. Ka4 Qa1+ 61. Qa3 Qd4+ 62. b4 {My idea. I want to try and push this pawn while blocking checks.} Qd7+ 63. Kb3 Qd3+ 64. Ka4 Qa6+ 65. Kb3 Qd3+ 66. Ka2 Qc4+ 67. Qb3 Qa6+ 68. Kb2 Qf6+ 69. Qc3 {No more checks!} Qb6 70. Qc2+ Kf3 71. Qd3+ Kf4 72. Qc4+ Ke5 73. Qe2+ Kd5 74. Kb3 Kc6 {Sneaky! Forcing queens off here would make a draw!} 75. Qe6+ Kb5 76. Qc4# {A rough game. Clearly there's room for both my opponent and I to improve.}
