[Opening "QGA (D21), 3.Nf3"]

1. d4 {Normally leads to long, slow games.} d5 {Sticking to Classical lines.} 2. c4 {Traditional.} dxc4 {I accept the gambit.} 3. Nf3 {Developing.} c5 {Trying to KO the White center, since my QP has been diverted.} 4. e3 {White supports the strong point at Q4.} cxd4 {I proceed as planned.} 5. Bxc4 {Clears the way to castle. Right at this moment the Tigers hit a home run and I made my next move without looking carefully at the board.} dxe3 {I figured on being a Pawn up after 6 QxQ ch KxQ in return for losing the right to castle. But...} 6. Bxf7+ {Ooopsie. Missed that he could do this first. That's what I get for trying to do 2 things at once.} Kxf7 {Forced, and...} 7. Qxd8 {...I resign. At least the Tigers won their game, even if I lost mine.}
