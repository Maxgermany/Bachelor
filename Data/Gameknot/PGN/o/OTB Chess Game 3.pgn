[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Taimanov (chase/wing/accelerated counterthrust) variation"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual, as does Ted.  In fact, this is going to become a Ruy Lopez because his style of play is 2...Nc6.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Ted plays this much more often the Berlin Defense.  However, I did not know what to expect because the in the first game which also was not that good, he answered with the Berlin Defense.  Similar to if he played that, I also stick to the mainlines here.} 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 Na5 {The only thing I don't like is that pieces will be exchanged.  And, I'm not ready to do it, but part of the mainline is this early exchange.  Thinking about what Ken told me with exchanges combined with there being little no time, I decide to grab his center pawn.} 6. Nxe5 Nxb3 7. axb3 f6 {?! Of course, he could've won this back with 7...Qe7 as Jack Stockel has showed me.  But, with very little time, I anticipated this being played.} 8. Nf3 {Not knowing what to do or having enough time for more analysis, I retreat.  But, in this case, I should've given him my N.  As he would've taken.  Had there been more time, that would've been my answer as I would've played 8.0-0.  The idea is just like in the Domiano's Defense, so if 8...fxe5??, I've got 9.Qh5+! which would've been a killer.  And, that's the only move where my concentration wasn't 100% because I spent some time analyzing what to do, and this point, there's only 15 minutes before I have to wrap it up.} Bb7 {Putting pressure on my center pawn.} 9. Nc3 {Which I end by continuing with my development.} c6 {I'm not sure why Ted played this since it blocks his diagonal. } 10. O-O {But, nothing stops me from castling.} b4 {As anticipated, he attacks my N.  } 11. Ne2 {So, I protect.  You'll note that 11.Nb1 also came into consideration, but I didn't want to undevelop.} d5 {Going for a pawn exchange.  Of course, it'll happen sooner or later.  But, I asked myself if it would work now.  And, I decided that it does because another reason for playing 11.Ne2, as opposed to, 11.Nb1 is that I calculated a variation.  But, by exchanging, it will work.} 12. exd5 cxd5 13. Re1 {That variation continues with this move.  As the idea behind centralizing the Rook is because of what's about to follow.} Bc5 14. Nf4+ {Which is this discovered.} Ne7 {I anticipated getting out by interposing and developing his N.} 15. d4 {And, my response is breaking open the center by attacking his Bc5.  The idea behind is that once you castle, it's generally wise to do that as it gives you better control of the center.  It will also allow me to win another pawn.  For once Ted retreats I will fork his Queen and g7 pawn. } Bd6 16. Ne6 Qd7 17. Nxg7+ Kf7 {Once Ted gets out of check, I decide to place my N on the rim because I'm organizing that with my other N and Queen.  That's because of one variation where I might be able to deliver a devastating attack with these three pieces working together.} 18. Nh5 Qf5 {Not to my surprise, Ted tries to stop that.} 19. Nh4 {But, I've got a way around that since my Nh5 is now protected by the Queen.} Qd7 20. Re3 {This was also part of the plan behind bringing both N's on the rim.  Once Ted retreated, I also bring the Rook as I'm looking at everything that the position indicates because of what I learned from bhidragon.  In this position, my aim is to use my pieces to attack.  But, better would've been 20.Qf3  I did have a little bit of Ghost Vision that was caused by how little time there is.  As there's only, at most, 5 minutes before I need to pack up and get ready for work.  So, I thought that, somehow, Ted's d5 pawn advanced, or the Queen moved to the same diagonal as f3.  Had I analyzed a little more carefully, I would've seen otherwise, and thus, would've played it.  But, it's not too late.  } Bc8 {And, that's because of this move.  I'm not sure why Ted played because if Qf3, mate could be prevented my moving the K back.  But, after further review, it makes sense.  Like me, Ted also has to leave at about noon so there was just as little time for him.  He was worried that the Queen was in danger, and thus protects.} 21. Qf3 {But, that's when I see the opportunity and play what I mentioned since mate is threatened.  That threat is not immediate.  But, what I'm alluding to is that after 22.Qxf6+, it's mate in 3 or 4.  For once the K moves back, then I'd play 23.Rf3, and after the K moves back, it's mate, with either my Queen or my Nh5.} f5 {Not surprisingly he stops the threat.  But, right after this move, we had to pack up and leave.  So, our time had run out.  And, as noted, this would've been recorded as unfinished, but Ted resigned.  My guess is that with us having to go he didn't want to continue.  Although we wouldn't have, anyhow.  But, enough was enough for him.  And, my guess is that on top of being two pawns down, he knows that I am a stronger player and also didn't want to resume in this position since I would not allow counterplay.  Despite not having a lot of time and playing one or two inaccurate moves, I believe that my play was much better here then the other two games because the distraction was gone.  So, the important moral to get out of the three games is that if there is a distraction, as noted in my last annotation, pretend that there is a door to block it out.  That's important in chess and in life.}
