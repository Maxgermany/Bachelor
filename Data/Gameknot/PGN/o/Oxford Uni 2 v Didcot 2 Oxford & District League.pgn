1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {All standard Kings Indian so far.} 5. h3 {It's in the book but not very common.  I think it's a fairly pointless move at this stage as I have not intention of putting either my B or my N on g4 in the near future.} O-O 6. Bg5 {This is another move I don't come across very often.  It's a nuisance because it hinders my normal plan of ...e5 followed shortly after by ...Ne8 or ...Nd7 or ...Nh5 and then ...f5.  I don't like to try pushing it away immediately as it makes the pawn on h6 a target for White's Q & B.} c6 {I don't think I've tried this before.  The main purpose was to prevent Nd5 but it also increases the Q's scope on the Q-side.  I think I've usually met Bg5 with ...Qe8 but for some reason I decided against that this time.} 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. Bd3 e5 {The standard King's Indian central break, but this time it pins my own N.} 9. d5 Qc7 {Making use of my new hole on the Q-side, but I wasn't sure this was the right square, given that White can quickly oppose it with his rook.  ...Qb6 would have had the virtue of aiming at f2 and b2 simultaneously but I think the b2 pawn would have been fairly poisonous.} 10. Qd2 {White retains the option of castling either side and prepares to attack the fianchettoed bishop.} Ne8 {Pressing on with my plan.} 11. Rc1 {Now White is committed to either castling kinside or staying in the middle.} f5 {Now White is in danger of having his B cut off or trapped, so the swap on f5 seems forced.} 12. exf5 gxf5 {The normal recapture in the King's Indian, even when the QB is available to recapture.  The pawn front presents White with problems, the immediate threat being a fork with ...e4.} 13. Bb1 {This safe retreat allows the B to maintain long term pressure against h7.} Ndf6 {This frees up my QB and prepares to take the battle into White's half of the board.  Meanwhile, the other N looks after the weak pawn on d6.} 14. O-O Qf7 {Black slowly builds up for a decisive kingside attack on the finally castled king.  I needed to play this before I developed my QB as the QB would have prevented my Q from getting across to the kingside, where I wanted it.} 15. dxc6 bxc6 16. b3 Bd7 {I would have preferred to develop this B to b7 but had to maintain my defence of f5.  My priority at this stage was to connect my rooks but I couldn't do this while I needed to defend d6 with the Ne8.} 17. Nh4 {Now White gets his attack in first.} Nh5 {Solely to defend f5.} 18. Bh6 Rd8 19. Qg5 {This was starting to look scary but everything was under control.  The immediate threat is to my unprotected rook on d8.} Nc7 {This move looks odd because it takes the N away from the action but it connects my rooks and threatens to counter-attack the Q with ...Ne6.  It isn't needed to defend d6 any more, nor g7, which is defended, albeit awkwardly, by the Nh5 as well as by Q and K.} 20. Bxg7 {Attacking the Nh5 with g4 might have been better.  White never quite brought enough power into his attack.} Nxg7 21. Qd2 {Realising he doesn't have the forces available to press home his attack, White tries to regroup by attacking d6 once more.} Bc8 {This retreat harmonises Black's position nicely.  Everything is finally ready for the counter-attack.} 22. Nf3 Nce6 23. Rcd1 Qh5 24. Qc1 Nf4 25. c5 {White overlooks Black's threat.  I think Kh2 or Nh2 was called for.} Nxh3+ 26. gxh3 Qxf3 27. Rd3 Qh5 28. Rg3 {This runs into trouble.  Perhaps a K move would have been better.} f4 29. Rg2 Bxh3 30. Rh2 Qg4+ 31. Kh1 Qf3+ 32. Kg1 Rf6 {and, despite the fact that the obviously threatened ...Rg6 doesn't work yet, due to Bxg6, White resigned.  I was planning ... Nf5 next, which should have been good enough.}
