[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Scandinavian variation"]

1. e4 {I start off with my normal opening.} Nf6 {As with our first game, Carl answers with Alkehine Defense.} 2. Nc3 {I had also considered protecting with 2.d3, but I decided to start developing, as well.} Nc6 {And, Carl continues with his development.} 3. Bb5 {As do I.  The only problem is what Carl's going to play next.} a6 {As I'm, eventually, gonna be forced to exchange N for B.  Just like with the Ruy Lopez, if 5.Ba4, black can respond with 5...b5, and after 6.Bb3 Na5  And, it's better for white to do it earlier then later on when he or she faced with doubled pawns on the b file.} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {Carl captured the correct way.  Usually, you want to capture towards the center, so with 4...bxc6  But, in a position like this, archduke_piccolo showed a variation, forgot what it was, but it shows why exchanging from the center was better here.} 5. Nf3 {Meanwhile, I start developing.  My goal is to castle here.  } Bg4 {But, pinning my Nf3 delays it a move.  Instead, I'll try to break his pin by going on the offense.} 6. h3 Bh5 {As expected.} 7. O-O {I took a while, almost 5 minutes, to think about what to do.  The only other move that came to mind was 7.g4.  And, I almost played it to break the pin, once and for all.  But, after careful consideration, I decided against it.  The reason being is that it would leave my K vulnerable to exposure were I then to castle short.  Instead, I'd have to waist tempii getting my Bc1 and Q out, and then, castling long.  So, I felt that it was better to tuck the monarch away, once and for all. } Bg6 {At first, I wasn't sure why Carl played it, but I quickly figured out that he's going after my e4 pawn.  As it's attacked twice but only protected once.} 8. Ng5 {? So, I protect again.  But, this is the wrong choice as Carl attacks again.  Now, I'll have to protect again, and when that happens, Carl is going to win a pawn.  And, that's a very important pawn since it's right in the center.  Much better was 8.d3, or 8.Re1.  I thought that taking back was going to prevent him from winning it, but, I was wrong.  As it goes back to only one defender against 2 attackers.} h6 9. Nf3 Nxe4 10. Nxe4 Bxe4 11. Re1 {Given that I, subconsciously, liquidated while a pawn down, I centralize one of my R's, by attacking his Ne4.} Bg6 12. Ne5 {I attack again and threaten to double up his pawns on the g files.  After what happened in our first game, Carl is not about to let me take of his weakest square on the board.} Bh7 {So, he protects again.} 13. d3 {I come up with another idea.  Of course, I'm not even going to bother with 13.Qf3?! since it's way too easy to drive off.  That would be much too easy to drive off.  So, I develop again by preparing to get my last piece into play.} e6 {I'm not sure why Carl played this.  As black, I would've attacked with 13...f6.  But, this allows me to complete my development, once and for all.} 14. Bf4 Bd6 {Meanwhile, Carl goes after my N, but that doesn't bother me.} 15. Qg4 {I'm trying to make this look like a cheapo tactic since g7 is attacked.  But, the reality is that I'm not interested in that point.  Instead, I got what I really wanted which was completing my development and connecting my R's.  And, the reason for making a simple move like this, is that, I'm beginning to think of a long term variation that would prove to be overwhelming.  It's a long way down the road, but what I visualize is about to become a reality much later on.  Yes, I'm calculating about 10 or 15 moves down the road.  The only problem is that I'm, probably missing something along those lines.} Qf6 {For one thing, my anticipation was that black would play 15...g6 which was a conditional move.  From there, I would plan an attack starting with 16.Qe2 and 17.d4.  As now, we're talking about the Q behind R, which is usually of bad omen for the opponent.  With this move, however, I hold off.} 16. c3 {And, I play this, instead.  The idea is that after 17.d4, I've got a solid pawn chain.  But, Carl puts a stop to that by attacking my Q on his next move.} Bf5 17. Qh5 {So, I play this.  I wasn't even going to consider 17.Qh4?? since 17...g5 forks and wins a piece.  But, his next move is conditional as I'm already starting to think about what I can do with my Q, down the road.} g6 18. Qf3 g5 {Of course, I overlooked this along the variation.} 19. g4 {But, I don't have a problem with it.  Instead of retreating, I counterattack, as I've also got a nice pawn chain.  Yes, I'm now ready to exchange here.  I don't want his LSB there for the attack that I'm planning.} Rg8 {Of course, I'm not surprised to see this because it adds another defender to g5.  But, I wasn't interested in that pawn, anyhow since I'm about to exchange.  However, there's another reason, and that's due to what's about to happen when Carl recaptures.} 20. gxf5 gxf4+ {And, that's me being in check.  But, I don't have a problem with that.} 21. Ng4 {As I interpose to go right after his Q.  Once he retreats, I will win a pawn back.  That was the, immediate, plan behind 17.Qh5  I didn't have all, but had most of that calculated.  But, the longer term is going to happen later on, as a result of one or two oversights from black.} Qh4 {? And, Carl protects his Q with this move.  Best was 21...Qe7 to protect e6 which is where I'm about to take.  I think he's hoping that I move to my Q to allow him to win my h3 pawn and expose my K.  That's not going, until it's safe to do so which is near the very end of this game.} 22. fxe6 O-O-O {? I understand why Carl wanted to castle, at once.  But, best was to recapture with 22...fxe6.  This move is going to give me the initiative now, as I'm about to wind up a pawn up.} 23. exf7 Rdf8 {?? At first, I thought that he used the other R.  For some reason, this is the one that Carl used.  But, it loses, as I'm about to promote, and even when Carl recaptures, I'm about to wind up a R+P.  Be it note that this is the long term sequence that I had visualized since 17.Qh5  Even if the short term worked, it was more likely that the long term wouldn't.  In fact, had Carl prevented me from capturing, recaptured, or used the other R, it would not have been possible for me to promote and win significant material the way that it happened.} 24. fxg8=Q Rxg8 25. Qe4 {Seeing Carl's weakness, I go for it and threaten to do more damage.  Contrary to other threats, this one is a lot more difficult to drive off, especially, since the Q is in front of the R which is what prevents him from playing 25...Re8??} h5 {?? But, Carl played this which is just as blunderous.  Much better was to move his Rg8 off of the g file.  Seeing the opportunity, I now fork his K+R, knowing that it will do more then just win a R.  In fact, soon after, I have a mating sequence against him, and I see almost the entire thing now.  In fact, I've got it visualized.} 26. Qe6+ Kb8 27. Qxg8+ Ka7 28. Re8 Qxh3 29. Ra8+ Kb6 30. Qb3+ Ka5 {The exception was when Carl played this.  I thought that he would play the only other move being 30...Kc5, and I was prepared to mate with 31.d4#.  I almost didn't see it, but then something occurred to me.  Oh yes, the B+N endgame checkmate which ION and I studied together where I became familiar with how to mate with those and the K.  Of course, it's something that I mentioned to two of my students, which is confining the K to the corner where it can't get out.  Well, I convert a different equation and figure out how to do it.  } 31. Ne5 {And, it's with this move.  If 31...Bxe5, then my next move would be 32.Qxb7, and no matter what black does, he can't prevent 33.Rxa6# or 33.Qxa6# which are both checkmate since his Q is out of play.  Carl takes note of why I'm giving my N away, and he tries to prevent mate with his next move which allows me to mate a move earlier.  But, I also kept that in mind.} c5 32. Nc4# {}
