1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I was playing an unrated game with my buddy dmaestro and chose a passive line of the French Defense.  Mike punished this inferior play and I ended up in a lost endgame.  How did this happen?  Well, here is the analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18392913&fb=1&rnd=0.987399748558625} e6 2. d4 a6 {2. ..... a6?! - here I play an unusual line of the French Defense.  It gains me no prizes in this game, however.} 3. Bd3 d6 4. c3 c5 {4. ...... c5 - a pawn moves to the 4th rank at last but I am already behind in development.} 5. Ne2 Nc6 {5. ..... Nc6 - now a piece finally emerges.} 6. O-O Nge7 7. Be3 cxd4 8. cxd4 {8. cxd4 - pawn trade.  Mike's central pawns look very imposing indeed.} Bd7 9. Nbc3 Ng6 {9. ..... Ng6 - now the other knight moves to the third rank, this is to free up Fou Lenoir.} 10. f4 Be7 11. Qe1 O-O {11. ..... 0-0 - now Henry is tucked away.  My development is almost complete but, as you can see, unless I can undermine Mike's imposing pawn centre, passivitis is gonna appear in my position like dry rot!} 12. Rd1 Qc8 13. Na4 {13. Na4 - threat - Nb6.} Bd8 14. Nac3 Bb6 {14. ..... Bb6 - trying to find decent squares for my pieces.} 15. Qf2 Ba7 16. g4 f5 {16. ...... f5 - I try and bust up that imposing little pawn wall on the kingside but this does not help, even though it does expose the WK.} 17. gxf5 exf5 18. e5 dxe5 19. dxe5 Bxe3 20. Qxe3 {20. Qxe3 - after a plethora of pawn exchanges and the two dsbs my position hasn't improved much.  White has a solid passer which will be a real thorn in my derriere later on.} Be6 {20. ..... Be6 - Fou Leblanc blockades.} 21. Na4 {21. Na4 - renews the threat of a fork on b6.} Qe8 22. Nb6 Rd8 23. Bc4 Rxd1 24. Rxd1 {24. Rxd1 - rook trade.} Na5 25. Bxe6+ Qxe6 {26. ..... Qxe6 - Glenda is now forced to take over the blockading role.  This is not good.} 26. Nc3 Nc4 27. Nxc4 Qxc4 {27. ...... Qxc4 - I do manage to trade off that dominant knight on b6 but white still has a clear/winning advantage.} 28. Rd4 Qc7 29. Qd2 Nh4 {29. ..... Nh4 - I threaten a family fork of my own, but the threat is easily dealt with.} 30. Qf2 Ng6 31. Qd2 Nh4 32. Rd3 {32. Rd3 - avoiding a draw by threefold repetition.} Qb6+ 33. Qf2 Qxf2+ 34. Kxf2 {34. Kxf2 - the queens come off the board but little has changed in the status quo.} Ng6 35. Ke3 Re8 36. Rd7 Re7 {36. ..... Re7 - what else?} 37. Rxe7 Nxe7 38. Kd4 {38. Kd4 - white's active king is gonna prove decisive in this knight endgame.} Kf7 39. Kc5 Nc8 40. Kd5 Ke7 {40. ..... Ke7 - Henry tries to centralise himself but cannot get very far.} 41. Na4 h6 42. Nc5 {42. Nc5 - the loss of a pawn is unavoidable but I attempt some counterplay on the kingside.} g5 43. fxg5 hxg5 44. Nxb7 f4 {44. ...... f4 - I push my own passer as far as I can, but this does not wash.} 45. Nc5 Nb6+ 46. Ke4 {46. Ke4 - Mike's king goes towards my kingside pawns.  Henry is still being pegged back in his own half.} Nc4 47. h4 gxh4 {47. ...... gxh4 - pawn trade.} 48. Kxf4 h3 49. Kg3 h2 50. Kxh2 Nxb2 {50. ..... Nxb2 - My h pawn is traded for white's b pawn.  I am still a pawn minus and I don't think my a pawn can be held.  Henry is still tied down to that passer on e5.} 51. Kg3 Nc4 52. Kf4 a5 53. Ke4 Nb6 54. Kd4 {54. Kd4 - now the WK comes across to my knight and a pawn.} a4 55. a3 Kf7 56. Kc3 Kg6 57. Kb4 Kf5 {57. .... Kf5 - Henry trebuchets round to the e pawn but it will be too late.} 58. e6 Kf6 59. Kb5 Nd5 60. Kxa4 {60. Kxa4 - now my a pawn does fall.} Nc7 61. Ka5 Nxe6 62. Nxe6 Kxe6 {62. ..... Kxe6 - the e pawn finally falls but Henry will not get to b8 in time.  Four moves later I resigned the game on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  Gameknot Analysis showed that Mike had a mate in 13.  Well played, Mike - you are one worthy winner!} 63. Kb6 Kd7 64.
