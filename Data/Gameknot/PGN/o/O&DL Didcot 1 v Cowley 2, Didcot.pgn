1. e4 c5 {My usual response to 1. e4 } 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 {A relatively unusual continuation.  White's early Q move causes Black to reconsider his planned Najdorf variation.  Should I chase the Q straightaway with ..Nc6 or leave it there a while?  I decided that the immediate N move would invite White's LSB to pin on b5 and would thus achieve little. Therefore, I continued with a normal Najdorf move ... } a6 5. c4 {White's pawn formation is typical of the Maroczy Bind, though I don't think that is usually combined with 4. Qxd4.  The bind is aimed at restricting Black's position. } Nc6 {Now there's no harm in putting the question to the Q. } 6. Qe3 {White keeps her Q centralised but restricts the scope of her DSB, which she is probably already planning to fianchetto. } Nf6 7. h3 {Nearly always a useful move at some stage but it does weaken g3 and can invite tactics based on pinning the g-pawn against the castled K.  In this case, I think the primary purpose was to prevent ...Ng4, attacking the Q again. } e6 {Black is aiming for a standard Scheveningen formation against White's somewhat unusual formation. } 8. Be2 Be7 9. O-O O-O {Black appears slightly ahead on development at this stage, thanks to White's exposed Q having moved twice and all other Q-side pieces still on their home squares.  However, Black has made one extra pawn move and not yet developed his Q.  Neither side has any significant weaknesses at present, though Black has the possibility of getting a fork on c2 and White may be able to exploit the weakness on b6. } 10. Rd1 {White seizes control of the half-open d-file, pinning the d-pawn and thus creating the possibility of playing e5. } Qc7 {Black sidesteps the pin and develops to a standard square, also looking at the exposed pawn on c4. } 11. Nc3 Bd7 {Completing the standard Scheveningen formation: a compact and flexible platform for careful counter-attacking manoeuvres on either wing. } 12. b3 {Bolsters c4 and prepares the anticipated fianchetto. } Rad8 13. Bb2 Rfe8 {Now Black is exceedingly well centralised! - albeit somewhat restricted.  One of the problems with this formation is calculating how best to open up and attack.  If Black plays too passively from now on, he gets crushed. } 14. Na4 {"A knight on the rim is dim" as the saying goes but in this case it has a good purpose in building up pressure on b6 and releasing the power of the fianchettoed B, which can get to b6 in 2 moves, to skewer Black's Q and R. } Nb4 {At last Black advances, threatening the even more immediate fork on c2 and giving Black's Q and LSB room to breathe. } 15. Qd2 {White prevents the fork and attacks the intrusive N.  Can Black opening up the file to attack the exposed Q though? } d5 {I was loath to retreat the N so looked hard for an alternative solution, eventually deciding that this pawn thrust met several objectives at once: defending the N, attacking White's centre, opening up lines for Q, DSB and R.  If White exchanges on d5, Black's exposed N can centralise by recapturing on d5 at the appropriate moment. } 16. exd5 exd5 17. Be5 {An interesting response which I hadn't considered.  I had considered Bxf6 and cxd4, both of which were easily met by recaptures that improved my position. } Qa5 {I rejected ...Bd6 because after White swapped on d6 and d5 I would have been left with a pinned N on d5 that could be attacked by Be2-c4. However, I could then have forked a4 and c4 with b7-b5... This Q move over-defends the N and d-pawn but invites a skewering pin by Be5-c3.  My intention then was to play Bxa4 followed by Qxa4, winning a pawn while maintaining the defence of the N } 18. Nb2 {Another unexpected response.  The N looks somewhat awkward here but this does prevent my intended response to Bc3 so made me think again. } Ne4 {The other N leaps into the fray, attacking White's Q and covering the c3 square } 19. Qf4 {White counter-attacks by advancing the Q to f4, where she threatens Kingside action and also a fork of Q and R from c7. } Qc5 {Again, counter-attacking by threatening check on f2 while reducing the power of White's threat of Bc7 and eliminating the need to cover c3. } 20. Bd4 {That pesky B again! } Qd6 {Inviting the Q swap or a repetition, which I didn't expect White to be content with. } 21. Qxd6 Bxd6 {The swap has enabled me to improve the position of the DSB and open up the e-file for my rook.  My Ns are still looking threatening and relatively secure at this stage, so I felt happy with my position.  I had about 10 minutes in hand over my opponent at this stage. } 22. Bd3 {White invites me to swap either of my active Ns for her inactive B, which, naturally I'm reluctant to do, so I improve the support of the Ne4 and p on d5 ... } Bc6 {... but this also deprives my outlier on b4 of a retreat square, increasing the probability that I'll have to swap after all. } 23. Bb1 {... and White has second thoughts about swapping.  Now the threat is simply to win the Nb4 with 24. a3. } a5 {So I create a retreat for the N. } 24. Bb6 {White sees an opportunity to win a pawn, by forking it and my R } Rda8 {It took me surprisingly long to find this ... } 25. a3 {As expected ... } Nc3 {but now I found a useful zwischenzug, exploiting the fact that Black's DSB no longer dominates the long diagonal. } 26. Rf1 {Perhaps surprisingly, perhaps not, White didn't want to swap R and P for 2 Ns. } Na6 27. Bxa5 {Black having cut off the R's defence of the p, White snaffles it and attacks the Nc3 but she has diverted her B off her best squares. } Ne2+ {Now I had a lovely vision of creating mayhem with a quick dash across the board from a6 to g3 and breaking open White's kingside, possibly delivering mate, but if not, at least winning the exchange or swapping 2 Ns for R and 2 Ps. } 28. Kh1 Nc5 {The vision starts to become reality, propelled by the exposed threat to the misplaced B. } 29. Bc2 {Another unexpected response, causing me to realise that an immediate ..Rxa5 will be met by a fork from b4 - the threat hadn't really been a threat at all, so White calmly redeveloped her LSB and reconnected her Rs while defending the Pb3 from my other threat of Nxb3, which would have forked R and B. } Ne4 {The vision is one step closer to reality. } 30. b4 {White is perhaps unaware of the vision or dismisses it as mere fantasy, preferring to consolidate her pawn advantage and preserve the outlying B for future duty. } Be5 {Now the doubts set in as, calculate as hard as I could, I couldn't find better than a draw from my planned 30 ...N4g3+ 31. fxg3 Nxg3+ 32. Kg1 Nxf1 33. Kxf1. So I decided to bring up reinforcements ... Alternative variation: 30... N4g3+ 31. fxg3 Nxg3+ 32. Kg1 Re2 33. Rac1 Nxf1 34. Kxf1 Rae8 35. Bb6 Bg3 36. Nd3 dxc4 37. Nde5 Bxf3 38. Nxf3  Black has run out of attacking options. } 31. Nxe5 {Pretty much forced as White's Nb2 and Ra1 were skewered and any R move would have resulted in entrapment by the Ns. } Rxe5 {As a result of my long cogitations I was now at least 15 minutes behind on the clock. } 32. Bxe4 {and now I've lost my precious N, having missed the opportunity to plunge it into the inferno of a glorious attack. } dxe4 {and I compound the error by making the wrong recapture. This pawn just gets in the way. } 33. Bb6 {The B returns to the fray, defending e3 and f2 and threatening to reoccupy the long diagonal. } Rae8 {Desperately trying to find an alternative attack, I bring up reinforcements but the attack is too slow and easily countered.  The game was up at this stage, I felt. } 34. Be3 {White prevents the advance of the e-pawn, reducing my LSB to uselessness and controlling the square h6, where I had intended to place the Re8 in 2 moves time. } Rh5 35. Rfe1 {Now the N is to be trapped, having failed to fulfil its destiny.  } Nc3 36. b5 {Completing the cage. } Bd7 {a forced retreat that offers a mirage of another sacrificial attack } 37. Bd4 {The infernal prelate returns to the long diagonal with devastating effect, threatening to slay the errant knight in his toils. } Nxb5 {I make the most of a bad job by swapping the N for 2 pawns but that attack is stalling again. } 38. cxb5 Bxb5 39. a4 Bc6 {Hoping that by advancing the e-pawn I can exert a pin on the g-pawn and thus at least win the h-pawn with my R but then I realise that it's still only a swap while material down, so not that useful really. } 40. Nc4 {Now all White's pieces are active and it's effectively game over. } Re6 {Still trying to get some sort of attack going but it's too late.  At least the pawn advance would have enabled me to break up White's K's position. } 41. Kg1 {avoiding the line I had been contemplating but offering an alternative method of attack. } Rg6 {Short of time, I walk into a trap. } 42. Ne5 Re6 {and have to retrace my steps.  I don't want to have to recapture on c6 with the pawn that prevents White's a-pawn from being a passer. } 43. Nxc6 bxc6 {but now I realise that if I capture with the R, my bloody e-pawn falls and White will threaten mate in 1. } 44. Reb1 {QED } Re8 45. Rb6 Rc8 46. a5 c5 47. Rb5 {a cruel rebuttal of my feeble attempt at counterplay. } h6 {creating a hole for my K but I think the f-pawn might have been a better pawn to move.  Whatever, the c-pawn is doomed and White is bound, eventually, to Queen her a-pawn. } 48. Rc1 {the pawn is well and truly pinned! } Rd5 49. Rbxc5 Rdxc5 50. Bxc5 Ra8 {after this move I had exactly 5 minutes left on the clock so stopped recording my moves.  The following moves are translated from my opponent's Hungarian scoresheet. } 51. Bb6 Kf8 52. Rc7 Ke8 53. g4 g6 54. Kf1 f5 55. gxf5 gxf5 56. Rh7 {and I resigned as my R would either be lost outright or swapped off or yet another pawn would fall and I only had about 4 minutes left compared with my opponent's 12. }
