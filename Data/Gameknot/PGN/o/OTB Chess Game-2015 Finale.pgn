[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Taimanov (chase/wing/accelerated counterthrust) variation"]

1. e4 {Typical, and his next move is also the same.  Like with Jack, when I play against Ted, I usually play the Ruy Lopez.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 b5 {But, he usually plays this, as opposed to 4...Nf5 (which is the main line).  Despite that, however, this is common, as it will force my next move.} 5. Bb3 Na5 {This is the one time, where 5...Bc5 should be played, and after that, white follows up 6.c3, followed by 7.d4.  Therefore, this is no longer the main line.  Since he didn't stay with that, I am already trying to find a weakness to exploit.} 6. O-O {I considered 6.Nxe5, in this position.  But, now, it's similar to, if we played 1.e4, e5 2.Nf3, Nc6 3.Bb5, a6 4.Ba4, Nc6 5.Nxe4, Re8  The idea is that if I took, just like with ...Re8, he could answer with 6...Qe7, as not only would he gain something back, but I'd lose tempo, in return.  Although that's still in book, I didn't want to go into complications due to a chance of missing a possible weakness.  By playing this, I felt that there was still a chance for Ted to go wrong.  The idea is being what I noted of black not sticking to mainlines.  By, taking (which he does), I already start exploiting a potential weakness.} Nxb3 7. axb3 {That's because I take this way, as opposed to, playing 7.cxb3  The idea being is that, like we saw with one TA's blitz Q sacs, I now have an open file with the Rook.  As I learned in that game, open files can be dangerous.} Nf6 {Meanwhile, he develops another piece.} 8. Nc3 {So do I, but there's more to it then meets the eye.  As now, I'm confident that I can take on e5, without the fear of losing a possible advantage, except for one move that I overlooked, after that.  The idea being is that ...Qe7, is no longer a concern.  Yes, I'd lose tempo, but he can't take back on e5 (immediately) because of this move.  However, something else will happen which will result in the loss of time and give him back the pawn. } Bb7 {Putting his Bishop on a long diagonal.  But, having had played 8.Nc3, as noted, I'll take, on my next move.} 9. Nxe5 b4 {This, however, is the one move that I overlooked.  It was an oversight, which as ION noted, can't solved.  The idea being is that I must retreat my defender, he'll regain the pawn back. } 10. Nd5 {So, I played this.  Although, it doesn't lose a piece, my thought process was completely wrong and could've done that.  I anticipated 10...Nxe4, in which case, 11.Re1?? would be my next move, with the idea being that after 11...Bxd5!, 12.Rxe4??  This line, however, would've lost a Rook without compensation.  However, I get lucky and don't have the chance to make that blunder because he takes back on d5, instead, in which we exchange, afterwards.} Nxd5 11. exd5 Bxd5 12. d4 {I considered 12.Re1, with the idea being 13.Nxf7??, as it first appears to win a Rook with a nasty discovered.  Afterall, I remembered my game with unkitty, which worked, but that involved a different position, though.  In this position, however, I quickly ruled that out due to his Bd5, which would've lost a piece, as Ted does not overlook moves, like that.  Therefore, I decide to advance a center pawn with the being to, at some point complete development, whilst, adding a defender to my Ne5.  The idea being is that 12...Qe7 is no longer a concern.} d6 {Ted has the same idea to what I noted, about developing his DSB, whilst, hitting my Knight, anyway.} 13. Ng4 {I had a hard time deciding on weather to retreat here or on f3.  In fact, I almost played 13.Nf3, with the idea being that if 13...Bxf3, 14.Qxf3, strengthening my Queen.  But, I realized, at almost the last minute (just before moving) that I might need my Knight.  It's hard to know open or closed position and Knights V. Bishops.  So, when we reach a position where I'm not sure, my rule of thumb is that a Knight is usually worth more then a Bishop.  And, that's because of TA notes in his Q sacs, which I will another, one of these days.  The idea being is that, in two of those games, his Knights maneuvered all around the board which made them dangerous.  In fact, that's something that redfoxrising also emphasized in one of those annotations, so it shows just how much you can learn just from that.  The lesson is to keep that mobile on different squares, which is also the idea here.} Be6 {?? I have no idea why Ted played this, but it's a blunder, as I will win a piece for a pawn now.  Instead, I would've continued with 13...Be7, to complete development, followed by 14...0-0.  It shows that by being patient and looking for opportunities, I, finally, found a weakness that was exploitable.} 14. Re1 {The idea being is that his LSB is pinned.  And, after studying that position with stalhandske, which was mentioned in a different annotation, I take advantage of going after his Be6 since it'll be locked in.} Qd7 {Ted thought that this would protect his Queen.} 15. d5 {But, this is also the move that I was implying with 14.Re1, as now, his LSB is helpless.} O-O-O {So, Ted castles long.} 16. dxe6 {So, I take.} fxe6 {He takes back.} 17. Bg5 {Knowing his weakness, I hit his Rook.  The idea being is that only way to defend is with 17...Be7, which enables me to liquidate while ahead.} Kb7 {?? But, Ted plays this instead.  As a result, I will win his Rook and another pawn for a Bishop, which is even worse.} 18. Bxd8 Qxd8 19. Rxe6 Qd7 {Hitting my Rook.} 20. Re4 {Not only don't I mind, but the loss of tempo is no longer of a concern because time is important.  But, when down by the equivalent, it's difficult to get counterplay.} d5 {Ted hits again.  Initially, I thought he moved his Queen to c7.  First it was 20...Qd7 (except that the Queen is there)  But, then, it was 20...Qc7 which would've made it impossible for the other moves.  Yet, my Rooks does get attacking.  So, after going back in time and studying (which wasn't several years ago when playing an OTB game) I figured out that this is what was played.} 21. Rd4 {I played something after making a mistake, but taking it back made Jack upset for good reason.  I, originally, played 21.Rxb4+??  Seeing the advantage, it appeared that I won another pawn.  But, I overlooked his DSB.  Before he had the chance to play 21...Bxb4, I took back.  Now, I'm spoiled by the use of Analyze of Board, combined with, visualization, in which there are take backs, before you've made the move which is the same idea as here.  Mr. Stockel accurately said that Ted was being nice, but in an OTB tourney, there are no take backs.  Once a move is made, that's it.  And, taking it back is considered cheating, and therefore, would result in disqualification.  It goes with the rule of touch a man once, my teacher wants me to get in the habbit of not taking things back as that's one is forced to think harder.  As usual, I agree with him.} c6 {The good thing is that Ted gets a pawn chain, in return.  But, it's not as useful, in this position.  For one thing, that chain does not range from, for example, b7-d5  It's d5, c6, and you have the K.  However, the b pawn is on the fourth rank, and he doesn't have an e pawn.  Therefore, things don't change much. } 22. Ne5 {So, I hit his Queen.  Now, 22.Rc4 also came into consideration as he can't take my pawn without losing his Q.  But, aside from that, I didn't see the point because that would be it's only purpose.  But, this move keeps my N more mobile, especially, when he reattacks.} Qe6 23. Nd3 {This is what helps to keep it's mobility.} c5 {So, he hits my Rook.  } 24. Rf4 {Like before, but this time, without moving, I considered 24.Nxc5+??, with the idea being to fork Q+K.  It appeared to win his Queen, but the problem is Ted's Bf8.  So, I retreated, instead.} Kb6 {I the idea is to mobilize his monarch.  We have now approached the endgame, so the King is very useful, but things are still going to be difficult since he's a Rook down.} 25. Rf3 {Planning to play 26.Re3, but 26.Nf4 is also a possibility.  The idea is to hit his Queen and gain tempo to maintain the advantage.} Bd6 {But, when Ted plays this.} 26. Nf4 {I'll attack this way.  That's because I know Ted very well, and like what I was taught what to do with Tom, this opponent likes to exchange.  And, unlike before, even with N for B, I'm happy to go along with it because, when ahead, liquidating pieces is to your benefit.} Bxf4 27. Rxf4 Qd7 {This time, however, I have no idea why Ted played this.  But, one move is almost as good or bad as another.  In other words, he does not have a good move, left, at this point.} 28. Qd3 {Keeping that in mind, I threaten to win another pawn and his Queen for a Rook.  The threat is 29.Rxa6+, Kc7 30.Ra7, Kd6, or 30...Kd8, 31.Rxd7+, Kxd7  There are only two options.  One is 28...c4 blocking that, whilst, hitting the Queen, but after I'd still win another pawn after 29.bxc4, with a renewed threat, since 29...cxd4 isn't an option due to the obvious reason.} a5 {But, Ted finds the best move.} 29. Rf5 {So, I threaten to win another pawn.} g6 {? This time, however, Ted does not find the right response.  29...d4, or 29...Rd8 were the only options, as now I'm going to win another pawn. } 30. Rxd5 {When I took, Ted was wondering what he could do.  Originally, my opponent played 30...Kb7??, but he saw that I'd take with 31.Rxd7+, immediately.  Therefore, he took it back which I didn't mind.  First, I wouldn't have a right to be angry since I took back a move.  But, even so, and say that it didn't happen, I'd be fine with it because the idea is taking time, and sometimes, you must go back which is frequent with analyze the board.  However, Ted could not find a good move, and therefore, resigned.  This time, it's not premature, as black will lose his Queen, sooner or later.  For example, 30...Qe7 31.Rd6+, Kc7 32.Rxa5, Qxd6 33.Ra7+, Kc6 34.Ra6+, Kc7 35.Rxd6  When the game was finished, there was about, 30 minutes to play another which I did not annotate.  First, it was unfinished.  Second, but more importantly, with such a time crunch, I played horrible and blundered a Rook early.  But, before that, Ted said that he had fun playing and was still a little overwhelmed.  I told him that failing to complete his development led to his downfall.  However, I forgot that the decisive mistake was allowing me to pin his Bishop which was going to lose a piece for a pawn.  But, the more important moral is something that I'm being trained to do.  Don't deviate from the mainlines.  Doing so leaves you with a potential weakness that can be exploited sooner or later, as it did here.  }
