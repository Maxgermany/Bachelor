1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bc4 e6 7. Bb3 Be7 8. f4 {White adopts an aggressive approach against the Najdorf.  These initial moves were all knocked out very quickly.} Qc7 9. Qf3 b5 10. a3 Nc6 11. Be3 {White's first long think of the game produced a fairly standard move.} Nxd4 {I don't think I thought long enough about this.  White's dark squared bishop becomes very powerful on its new outpost.} 12. Bxd4 Bb7 13. O-O-O O-O-O {This was a difficult decision.  I eventually decided that the potential attack against a king-side castled position would just be too powerful and that I could give as good as I got from the queenside position: perhaps somewhat naive!} 14. Rhe1 {White completes his development with this excellent centralising move, overdefending e4 and thus giving him flexibility of movement.} Kb8 {To facilitate lining up major pieces on the c file and get them off the same diagonal.} 15. Qf2 {White immediately responds with the threat of the skewer and the possible check on a7.} Rdc8 {As planned ...} 16. Kb1 {White takes time to respond to the battery...} Rhe8 {? Completely overlooking White's next move, which sets up threats on the e5-b8 diagonal.  I think an immediate 16. ...Nd7 would have been better.} 17. e5 {!} Nd7 18. exd6 Bxd6 19. Bxg7 {At the time I thought this was just a pawn-grabbing waste of time but it also increases White's control of the black diagonals.} Nc5 {?  Completely missing White's response.} 20. Rxd6 {!  If I recapture on d6, 21. Be5 wins immediately.} Nd7 {I'd intended to swap on b3 but now I felt that it was imperative to contest control of e5 again.} 21. Red1 {White increases the pressure again.} Red8 22. Be5 Nxe5 {Glad to get rid of that bishop!} 23. fxe5 Rdg8 {An attempt to counter-attack but I'm already doomed.} 24. Rd6d7 Qc6 25. Qxf7 {Now the threats are of the mating kind.} Qxg2 26. Bxe6 {and of the forking kind ...} Rcf8 27. Qxh7 {and White is picking up material so even if I survive the mating attack he'll win with his extra pawns and knight.} Bc8 28. Ra7 Bxe6 {?? One blunder too many.  I was covering b7 from g2 but not c7.} 29. Qc7# {I need to improve my risk awareness in the middle game!  Well played by my opponent.}
