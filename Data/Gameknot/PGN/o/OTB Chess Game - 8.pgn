1. e4 g5 {Not to my surprise, Joe plays the Basman Defense.} 2. g3 {Terry also fianchettos.} h6 {Getting a pawn chain.  But, this doesn't develop.  However, Joe can get away with it.  When teaching chess, he does go out of book and play moves that you wouldn't expect.  The idea is giving the opponent a small edge but he wins.  The moral is not to get overly confident, and over the years, this has also helped me to improve because Jack said the same thing when I underestimated anitam and lost.} 3. Bc4 {Waisting no time, Terry develops.} e6 {And, Joe also starts his development by advancing the center pawn.} 4. d4 {And, Terry also develops his center pawn.} d5 {Joe continues with his development and prepares to exchange which is bound to happen.} 5. exd5 exd5 6. Bb3 Bg7 {Putting his Bishop on a comfortable diagonal.} 7. Nc3 {Meanwhile, Terry continues with his development.} Nc6 {As does Joe.} 8. Be3 {Developing, yet another piece.  And, Joe is gonna do the same thing.} Nge7 9. Qf3 {?? According to Joe, this is the losing blunder which is why I gave two quieries.  In it, TA said, Moving your Q out way too early in the game!!!!You will either get it pushed back with loss of tempo,lose points if it becomes forked or ex-rayed and in this case with a visitor to the club...Terry,he managed to get his Q trapped already by move #10...even before castling has been initiated on either side!Moving your Q out in this style of game,even before castling?   Huge mistake,especially against any strong player,let alone a monster like me!And he knew of my strength BEFORE the game began!So caution to the wind,and more defensive play my friend!!  } g4 10. Qf4 Ng6 11. Qxf7+ Kxf7 12. Bxd5+ {After having had lost the Queen for a pawn, Terry does what he can for counterplay with this move.  } Be6 {I actually anticipated Joe playing this.  I'm not shocked that Joe wants to exchange as that would benefit him since he is ahead.  } 13. Bxc6 {?? But, Joe said what I knew which is not to liquidate.  In it, he wrote, "Notice anything else?When you decide to continue a game after losing your Q in a trap(early on),it is extremely unwise for that player to play the "exchange game"...like he did on move #13.Bxc6!If your going to continue,being all those points down,you must do as I do in blitz!!!!!Run ploys,fall back and gain any kind of defense you can!Just continuing to play offensively and exchanging pieces will only SIMPLIFY the game down more,and in the end,I will have a much easier endgame to send that 50 ton boulder down on YOU!!So avoid exchanges when down serious material UNLESS the exchanges will result in gaining point value(like capturing a Rook for your Knight)or having some rare positional advantage that causes me major trouble."  .} bxc6 14. Nge2 {Now, Terry continues with his development and prepares to castle, but as Joe implied after the 10th and 13th move, it's too little too late.  } Rb8 {With that Joe targets the pawn.  And, when Terry protects...} 15. b3 Re8 {Joe centralizes his other Rook.} 16. O-O {With little to go on, I guess you can say, Terry castles, at once.} Qf6 {So, Joe puts pressure on the f file and adds an attacking force against the King.  Of course, the threat here is ...Bd5, followed by ...Qf3, threatening mate.  White's only defense would be to further liquidate.} 17. Ne4 {So, Terry tries to delay by attacking the Queen.} Qf5 {But, when Joe reattacks, however, Terry resigns.  That's because white must protect, and when he does another pawn will fall since this is a nasty fork.  So, he pointed out what went wrong.  However, he made another in the aftermath.  In it, Joe said, "I can be down a Q in blitz and a few times in corresp and OTB and still win,but then i'm a seasoned pro at this game(and the Basman).Many players are not,and 1842 is certainly not weak.But Terry came unprepared and went against opening theory with his loose Q moves.    This player resigned after only 17 moves.I'm glad he did,for he had no prayer when "I"am up a Q(the reverse of my Q blitz sacs!)...unless the Marshall came under Marshall law!   So,is the weaker Basman Defense primarily for blitz play and should be avoided in your GK long corresp games?No!Why?Are you going to sit there after I just showed you this OTB win and tell me that your opponent will never play like Terry above?Hogwash!And opening books in this case would have done little.This game moved out of book very early on and would not have prevented Terry from throwing his Q around a bit recklessly!See now????   I just love the "illogic" in many players minds!You forget,I am a psychologist and know what I others think,even if they do not admit it!And chess is a game of psychology,indeed!"  }
