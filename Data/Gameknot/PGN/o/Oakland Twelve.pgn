1. e4 {Kings Indian Attack, within the limited knowledge I possess.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. g3 Nc6 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. d3 {generally standard opening moves. } e6 6. Nbd2 {I know little variations of the KIA... thus I use this one Nbd2, helps in center. } Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. a3 Qc7 9. b3 b5 10. Bb2 e5 {The atmosphere in the DMZ tightens. } 11. Rc1 Bb7 12. c3 {Hoping to find an opening at the Black Queen. } a6 13. b4 Rad8 14. Qe2 Rfe8 {Everybody is loading the middle. } 15. Rfe1 Bf8 16. bxc5 dxc5 17. c4 {This gives White a "go" position ( a dead space at d4); clogs the middle. } Nd4 {... it gets filled by a Knight...} 18. Qf1 Nxf3+ 19. Bxf3 Rd6 {Black is preparing to stack rooks and hit the weak pawn at d3; White figures on defending with the B.} 20. Bg2 {Oh no White is not!} Red8 {Out of thin air a R-Q alignment on d6-e7 shows up and is a prime target for the Bishop!  and there is free P at e5.... Should White take or make some preparations before striking?} 21. Bxe5 {Strike now, .....and hold on!} Qa5 22. Bxd6 Qxd2 {White gets the R for a N and P ...   and can go for a series of trades.} 23. Bf4 Qxd3 24. Qxd3 Rxd3 {The Q exchange...} 25. cxb5 { P for P} axb5 26. e5 {Pushing and shoving...} Bxg2 27. exf6 {B for N... } Bd5 28. fxg7 {P for P...} Kxg7 29. Be5+ f6 30. Bb2 {Getting to the end game; every Pawn is valuable.} Bb3 31. Re3 Rxe3 32. fxe3 {R for R, and am hoping for B for B. } c4 {Even though White is ahead Rook to Bishop, White is unsure about stopping the connected two Pawns on the queen-side and the always nasty "Two Bishops".  } 33. Kf2 Bd6 34. Kf3 Be5 {Giving White the opportunity to take away the "Two Bishops" and get further pieces off the board. } 35. Bxe5 fxe5 {There is the B for B.  Now to tighten up the middle. } 36. h4 Kf6 37. g4 {White is hoping to grind this one down. } h6 38. Ke4 {The Black King is getting "confined to quarters". } Ba4 39. Kd5 Bb3 40. Kd6 {Trying to take another P, but can't get Black to cooperate. } e4 41. Kc5 Ba4 {Surprising to White is that the Black Bishop appears to be trapped and can't get out of this corner.  } 42. Kb4 {White closes quarters on the 'trapped' Bishop, which should lead to further losses for White.  At this point Black resigns noting no reason to 'drag this out'.  }
