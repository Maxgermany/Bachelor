1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. b3 {a new twist: in fact, enforcing an early d4...} Bg7 4. c3 {cleverly done: but it hinders the natural development of Whites' Queens' wing; Black will use that...} e6 {following the lines of the Hungarian variation on the Sicilian: the object is Ne7, 0-0, d5...} 5. d4 {as was to be expected: c5 gets dissolved...} cxd4 {forced...} 6. cxd4 {maybe best: White needs Nc3...} Ne7 7. Nc3 a6 {this is were the Najdorf extension comes in handy: square b5 is a very important square, in any Sicilian...} 8. Bd3 {Black is about to castle: so White has to at least prepare that too...} d5 {but Black decides different: made possible by a6; because otherwise Bb5+ would really be a problem for Black...} 9. O-O {no use in exd5, exd5...} O-O {a very important position: White has to decide what to do, but has little time left...} 10. Bg5 {development: but not without any consequences...} f6 {simple, yet very effective: first e4-e5, would have been an option...} 11. Be3 {Bh4 is unholy too: Bf4, would surely induce e6-e5...} b5 {making use, of the temperary status quo: taking away possible White moves...} 12. Qc2 {supporting e4, no doubt...} Bb7 {so let's return the favor...} 13. Ne2 {not sure, if this is the move: giving up the c-file, with a Queen on it; this is asking for troble...} Nd7 {serving mutliple purposes: Black controls the center, to begin with; and Rc8 is a nasty threat...} 14. Qd2 {maybe preparing a trade on h6...} f5 {a little trick, I learned from my former team captain: sadly, he forgot about it (see also the previous annotation)...} 15. exf5 Nxf5 {making Bh6 impossible, and attacking Be3...} 16. Bg5 Bf6 {no solution here either...} 17. Ng3 Kg7 18. Nxf5+ exf5 19. Rac1 {not donating much at all...} Nb6 {Black still has to finish development: the Black Queen needs a purpose; but White is helping with that one...} 20. Bxf6+ Qxf6 21. Ne5 {trying to break iron, with bare hands...} Rac8 {Nc6 is not really a threat: but Black needs to simplify...} 22. Nf3 {White needs to tackle the weakness of d4: costing tempo...} Rxc1 23. Rxc1 Rc8 {Black has the space and the play: time to equalize...} 24. Qg5 Rxc1+ 25. Qxc1 Qc6 {practically forced: this will at least lead to a draw...} 26. Qf4 Nd7 27. Ne5 Nxe5 28. Qxe5+ Kg8 {Black is holding ground: now, White has to reckon with Qc1+...} 29. g4 Bc8 {a trick: White tries to overpower the Kings' wing by force...} 30. gxf5 Qc1+ {only to cut, in his own flesh...} 31. Bf1 {not really an option is Kg2, Qg5+: this is not much better...} Bxf5 {White is in trouble: Black is threatening mate after Qg5...} 32. Qg3 Qb1 {a waiting move: White can afford very little; Bd3 is already a killer...} 33. Qb8+ Kg7 {relentless: but White does not give up that easly...} 34. Qb7+ Kh6 35. Qxd5 {forced: White has to return, to cover for Bf1; or else Bd3 is lethal...} Qxa2 {winning the pawn back, and keeping up the threat...} 36. Qf3 {forcing this one...} Qc2 {covering the Bishop} 37. Qf4+ Kg7 {a dangerous attempt from White; there are few checks left...} 38. Qe5+ Kf7 39. Qd5+ Kf6 {relentless...} 40. Qd6+ Kg5 41. Qxa6 {a miscalculation...} Qxb3 42. Bxb5 Qc3 43. Qb6 Qc1+ {Bf1, will fail after Bd3...} 44. Kg2 {but this will too...} Be4+ 45. Kg3 Qf4+ 46. Kh3 Qg4# {and resigned...}
