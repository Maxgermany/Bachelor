[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence, 4.O-O"]

1. e4 {Though both my opponent and I had a rating of about 1600 that time, I think the level of the game was higher than that and the final result was decided by only one move, one slight miscalculation.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {Spanish (Ruy Lopez), Berlin defence. Rarely played at higher level due to it being deeply analyzed and White has extremely good chances to hold a draw or even to go for a win. However, never underestimate your opponent.. a novelty can be winning only by being new even if it is not neccessarily ground braking. As they say the result of the World Tltle Matches usually depends on such novelties.} 4. O-O {This move practically communicates "I fear you not, Mate!". It casually ignores the fact Black is attacking a centre pawn and goes on with the normal Spanish plan. 4.Nc3 or 4.d3 would have defended the pawn, though both has drawbacks as well. 4.Nc3 develops a piece to a good position for it but seriously decreses the manouvering area of the b5 bishop and 4.d3 is slow and passive, hence looses tempo.} Be7 5. Re1 d6 6. d4 {An aggressive move to put more and more pressure on Black. 6.c3 might have been better or equally good but definitely a lot slower.} exd4 7. Nxd4 Bd7 8. Nxc6 {A bold, aggressive and pretty careless move. Black is relatively well developed and his defence is solid after castling while White is behind in development so it was worth considering some more to do on that area rather than rushing ahead. The only achievment White can come up with is that he has already castled. 8.Nc3 was more mature and careful here with developing a piece (no more need to take care about the b5 bishop). What can I say, I got excited and ignored the basic opening principals..} bxc6 {Good for forcing White to withdraw that bishop. Taking back with the bishop: 8... Bxc6 9.Nc3 0-0 10.Qe2 Qd7 11.Bf4 Bxb5 12.Nxb5 would have helped White in eliminating his only clash.. being underdeveloped. Too much complication without a clear adventage, better to avoid it.} 9. Bc4 {Keeping an eye on f7. Obviously in case nothing changes dramatically the queen-knight will be going to f3 through d2 to defend His Majesty and to create the opportunity of an overall king-side attack.} c5 {Most natural move to give way to the d7 bishop and to create something useful out of the double c-pawns. Possible alternatives are 9... Rb8 to occupy the half-open b-file of 9... 0-0 to put the king into safety. Lasker wrote that whenever you see no way to improve your game, do what is there to do anyway.. mostly this principal is used for castling.} 10. Nd2 O-O 11. Nf3 h6 {Cannot stop thinking that 11...Bc6 was better here. Would have doubled the attack on e4 and by that would have forced White to withdraw his bishop to e4. In practice this would have meant tieing up White a bit while placing the bishop exactly where it belongs to, to the long diagonal and making White leave f7 alone. Not even mentioning that it is always easier to calculate with forced moves.} 12. e5 {King is safe White is ahed in development considering the inactive black bishops, centre is occupied so it is time to try and break through.} Ng4 {No flawless choice presents itself. 12.... Ne8 is a firm option though, it is passive and even if it opens up the f-file the c4 bishop prevents Black to use it. This also means that the f-rook gets closed up.. so Black would have set up a defence giving White a chance for a full-scale attack. More or less the same holds to 12... Nh7 13.Qd3 Rb8 14.Qg6! where Black is struggling heavily. Taking back: 12... dxe5 did not work due to 13.Nxe5! threatening with a breakthrough on f7.} 13. Qd3 Be6 {The only real mistake Black has ever made! I would like to state that this move is easy to critisize but it is just as easy to overlook next to the board. Its major point is to block the white bishop's way to f7 while attacking it so White either accepts the exchange that might make Black's life a bit (and just a bit) easier: 14.Bxe6 fxe6 15.exd6!! or defends it that really favours for Black. 13... Rb8 or 13... Bc6 were more fortunate options. All those that blame my opponent here for this mistake I would like to ask if they would really have made it better? I have to admin that I would most probably have made the very same move he did.} 14. exd6 cxd6 15. Rxe6 {And here comes the only little tiny pitfall of 13... Be6. This sacrifice wins material by taking back on e6 with check.} fxe6 16. Bxe6+ Kh8 17. Bxg4 {15... Nxf2 16.Kxf2 fxe6 17.Bxe6+ Kh8 18.Kg1 would have been slightly better but White is clearly better..}
