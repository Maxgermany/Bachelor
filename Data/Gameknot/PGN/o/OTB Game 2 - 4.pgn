[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C69), exchange variation, 5.O-O"]

1. e4 {And, start off with my usual.} e5 {Just like with Ted, this is how Tom often responds.  Similarly, it often becomes the Spanish Opening.  After my game with Ted, however, I learned not to say that I know what my opponent is going to do.  Even if you know them and; 10 out of 10 time they allow the Ruy Lopez, things could change one day as it did with Ted a couple of days ago.  That was, when he played the Philidor's Defense.  However, Tom allows it.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 {Of course, I used to play 4.Ba4 (with the idea of not exchanging right away), but after 4...b5 5.Bb3 Na4?! I was forced to exchange anyway.  Then, I tried 4.Be2?! only to later find out why it's inaccurate.  However, I'm not going to try and avoid it anymore because charleshiggie said that 5...Na4? is a mistake.  Instead, black is better off to develop another piece, rather then, bring the N on the rim.} dxc6 5. O-O {In the Spanish Opening, you want to castle earlier then other openings which is another reason that I enjoy playing this.  As my thing is castle early and often.  Of course, I have to be weary of not castling into an attack since matsany mentioned about someone doing it any paying the price.  And, he explained how that happens.} Bd6 {Now, Tom develops another piece.} 6. Nc3 {As do I.} Bg4 {But, I overlooked this pin.  Normally, I think that it's no big deal since I often answer this with Be2.  In fact, I have gotten carried away with this just because Jack Stockel has told me that it's the most common way to break it.  In doing so, I've forgot what kenneth_fiore_3 said but it came back to me.  He said that you should give it more thought then just playing it because Jack said that it's usually the best move.  In doing so, I missed the opportunity to win a pawn earlier and take away Ted's right to castle since, as nuntar said, it could have been more aggressive (dramatic).  The other problem is that I don't have my LSB since I exchanged it early on.  So, my thinking is that it's better to sit back and wait.  In other words, I shouldn't do something to break this pin right away because he could mess up my K side pawn structures.  But, holding was just as inaccurate because Tom will do it, and he will also force an exchange which I am not ready for, yet.} 7. b3 {With me deciding to hold of the fianchetto, I focus on completing my development by fianchettoing my Bc1.  Afterall, I love fianchettos.  But, what I forget is that it's more useful when the N is not there.  That's because when you complete it and bring to it's main square like b2 or g2, they cover 6 squares.  That is when a N or pawn is not in the way.  In this case, it's the N, so where I to complete it with my N on c3, this would only cover 2 squares which is also what it covers with this move.  So, it doesn't make a difference, yet until I can, at the very least, move my Nc3 somewherelse.} Qf6 {This is what I start overlooking.  But, even if I saw it here and tried to do something, it's too late, as he'd exchange.  As it would result in the same thing as what Tom is about to do.} 8. d3 {Instead of completing the fianchetto right away, I felt that if Tom just left his Q there, I'd start harassing it with 9.Bg5 knowing that he can't block the attack.  The idea is gaining tempo.  Even though that's true, that way of thinking is flawed.  As now, he gets a favorable exchange.  } Bxf3 {At first, I thought that 8...Bxf3 pointless as there didn't appear to be a reason to exchange my N for his B.  But, I overlook something a lot more.  In fact, it's what I mentioned.  As I must take back to avoid losing a piece.  } 9. Qxf3 {Then, I thought that this is inconvienent and not what I had in mind.  But, it's the worst that it will get.  I was wrong because my K side pawn structures are going to be ruined which is going to leave my K vulnerable to exposure.  Of course, I am not completely with it and usually play a little better then this.  The problem is that I'm thinking about what I must do to get ready for the vacation.  As after the chess club ends and I am done with work, I have to get ready for work the next day.  Then, I have to do most of my packing the following day because I'm scheduled to work that Monday which is October 16th.  Then, I leave the next day and must have almost all of my packing by the 17th because I must leave a few hours early to get across customs.  And, that's combined with the fact that at an earlier time on that Tuesday, I take care of business before catching up from what I missed of, "The Voice" from the previous night since I had to work.  So, a lot is going on.  It's just too much to keep with at once and does have some effects on my play, as it did here.} Qxf3 10. gxf3 O-O-O {I was little surprised, however, with this move.  I had expected 10...Ne7 with the idea of castling short on his next move.  But, I felt a little more comfortable about my vulnerable knowing that Ted likely castled in the wrong spot.} 11. Bb2 {And, that's when I calmly complete the fianchetto, as well as, my development.  What I also like is that both of my Rooks are connected.} Nf6 {But, I thought a little too soon as that's what Tom also did.} 12. Rfe1 {I played this because the general idea is to centralize your R.  It was also to prepare, in case, Tom found a way to attack my e4 pawn.  As now, it'll have an extra defender, if he's able to do that.} Nh5 {I am not sure why Tom played this, but what I just figured is that his N is not in the right spot, and therefore doesn't have a good reason to place it here.  Of course, I'm just being more stubborn then usual because of what I mentioned earlier about getting ready for the big vacation.  } 13. Kh1 {However, I play it safe by giving my K some protection in the aftermath of leaving it vulnerable.} Nf4 {I figured out that this was goal.  But, I didn't know what it accomplishes.  However, after what happened in my game with bhidragon about 1.5 or 2.5 years ago, I thought that he might be trying to do something dangerous with it.  For example, getting both of his Rooks active with something like ...Rd8-h6 followed by something like ...Rh8-d7 with too many attacking forces against my K.  And, of course, there would be no way to escape with his N.} 14. Ne2 {Well, I didn't like the idea and tried to put a stop to that threatening an exchange.  I normally wouldn't because I didn't forget to not exchange when there is no good reason for doing so.  I felt that the threat he might have was a very good reason to do so.  Lucky for me, he went along with it and exchanged.} Nxe2 15. Rxe2 h5 {Trying to activate his R.  The idea is an open flank, as now, there will be mobility with the R.} 16. d4 {That, however, is of no concern to me since his N is off the board.  Therefore, I offer an exchange.  As I thought that it would win material given that after my next move, if he play ...Bxe5?? I win a piece for pawn with Bxe5.  As noted, I'm not thinking straight because of what he does next.} Rde8 {What I forgot is that this defends again.  So, I exchanged for the same reason as noted earlier.  The problem is that I didn't think about this move.  In fact, it didn't even occur to me.} 17. dxe5 Bxe5 18. Bxe5 {As this is what I analyzed and was happy here, until he took back on e5.  It's important to note that if I didn't have those other things to worry about, I would not have exchanged.  As my focus is generally on the "here and now".  That would've made me realize what's going on here and why Tom played 16...Rde8.} Rxe5 19. f4 {Knowing what I have done, I try just about anything by attacking his R with this move.  My main goal is to get an unstoppable passed pawn.  Unlike before, this is where I start getting back to the here and now.  So, the way I'm thinking here might just help me to do that since I won with a passed pawn that promoted.} Re7 20. Rae1 {Continuing with my goal by doubling up.  The idea is that e4 is now protected twice which is important, in case, Tom were also to double up with 20...Rhe8.} Rd8 {I'm not exactly sure why Tom played this.  I believe it's to prepare for an exchange which would allow the R on e1 check or d2.  The reason I speculate that is because this winds up happening later on.} 21. c3 {Now knowing what to do, I decide to advance my c pawn.  But, I think that better would've been 21.e5 as now, I would have a pawn chain to connect my e and f pawns. } f5 {? It was also to discourage something like this.  But, it doesn't matter as I'd have an en-pessant capture available.  Not being completely back to the here and now, I overlooked a chance to win a pawn which is why this was a mistake.  } 22. e5 {My thinking is that if I don't do something now, he'll get a passed pawn that will be difficult to stop.  So, being a little distracted, I was thinking about GM's have done in past games which TA showed me.  Thing is that it's not applicable in this position.  With that being said, this was done to stop his f pawn and get a pawn chain.  But, much better would've been 22.exf5  I was thinking that Tom would win a R or get a passed pawn with 22...fxe4.  However, I forgot that I doubled up to have another R on that spot.  This means that I would've been protected.} g6 {Likewise, Tom is also trying to connect his pawns.} 23. e6 {However, passed pawns must be pushed.  And, I am comfortable about my chances of promoting with this pawn.} Rg8 {Well, I am still going to play 24.Rg1, but this keeps his pawn protected.  The reason being is that if Tom removes the guardian, which will later happen, I'll be able to nab that pawn.} 24. Rg1 Kb8 {I am not sure why Tom played this.} 25. a4 {But, I try to break through by advancing another pawn.} Rd8 {? This is where the position starts to become a little corrupt.  As I had notated which 25...Rge7 which isn't possible, but in reality, is 25...Rge8.  It took me a while to figure out, but I looked at it and figured out that this is what Tom played.  How I figured it out is because of what will happen later on.  However, it's a mistake because this will cost him a pawn, once and for all.   Plus, he will wind up with isolated pawns which is why, unlike before, I saw and took advantage of the opportunity to capture here.  } 26. Rxg6 {Even if the notation was correct, this is what I would've done anyway.  In fact, that's why even after Tom defended with 23...Rg8, I brought one of my R's to g1.  As I figured that this was going to happen, with which, I'd capture here to break up Tom's pawn structure.  That is, leave him with isolated pawns.  But, it's more then that because, as noted earlier, I'm now a pawn up.} Ka7 {Like before, I'm not sure why Tom played this.  My guess is to get his K in action since this is an endgame.} 27. Rh6 {Similar to what I said with 25...Rd8, I had notated 27.Rf6.  But, after reviewing with what else happened, I figured that this is what I had played because of what happens later on.  The rest is the same, for now.} Rxe6 {?? With that being said this loses.  Tom probably thought that he was compensating for the lost pawn.  But, this is going to cost him a R instead without compensation.} 28. Rexe6 {Rather then recapture the other way, I took with this R to leave his h5 pawn under siege.  Taking with the other Rook would've removed the threat against that pawn.  What I forgot is that it's of no concern because I'm up an entire R.  I don't think any of us realized that.  The reason for me is what I noted about going away.  But, with that being said, I'd resign, if I were black.} Rd1+ {And, this is where I figured out that Tom played 25...Rd8, as opposed to, 25...Rge8.  That's because I remembered Tom placing me in check on d1 which forces my next move.  It doesn't matter, however, because of what I mentioned earlier.} 29. Kg2 Rb1 {Preparing to take on b2, if I decide to capture which is what happened.} 30. Rxh5 {That's why, even though 27.Rf6 was recorded, 27.Rh6 was what I played.  As my focus on was on the h pawn.  Had I played 27.Rf6, it would've, at the very least, taken a lot longer before I could make this capture.  But, this is exactly when I captured the pawn as I remembered the sequence.  In fact, that's why I also played 28.Rexe6, as opposed to 28.Rhxe6.  The idea being is that, as noted, capturing with the other R would've kept that pawn safe.  But, leaving it on h6 is what helped to make this capture available.  The reason I was interested in this pawn was because I thought that Tom would try to turn it into a passed pawn.  Even if it weren't to become a passer, I felt that it was the most dangerous pawn on the board, and was, therefore, going to take care of the problem.  Despite, that I'm still forgetting that there would've been nothing that Tom could do with his h pawn.  In fact, I now realize that it was never going to become a passed pawn.  Even if I did, I'd be able to stop it with my extra R.} Rxb3 31. Rf6 {I'm still ready for him to take on c3 because, when he does, I will capture his pawn on f5.} Rxc3 32. Rhxf5 {I also could've played 32.R6xf5.  But, I captured this way to allow my h pawn to advance since it is a passer.  Of course, I have two other passed pawns.  One of them is going to promote since they're, more or less, unstoppable, just like what we saw in GM Susan Polgar's annotation.} Rc4 {Trying to capture my a pawn.} 33. a5 {So, I protected.  Of course, my concentration is not completely there, as of the moment.  As it turns out, I could've just let it go.  Better would've been 33.h4 which immediately wins as there'd be nothing that Tom could do with that passed pawn.  The idea would be to let him take, and I'd keep advancing that pawn, until it promoted.  Were I not thinking about getting ready for the vacation, that's what I would've played, instead.} Rb4 {I'm not sure why Tom played this.} 34. Rh5 {My idea was to prevent Tom from getting an opportunity to play something like Rb4-h8 in the long run which threatens my pawn.  That, however, was of no worry.  Better was still 34.h4 for the reason that I mentioned earlier.} b6 {I'm not sure why he keeps advancing his b pawn.} 35. Rfh6 {Still being distracted, I just think about what Jack said about having two Rooks on one file.  That was also combined with me being worried that Tom would get a passed as I forgot that one of my Rooks was on h5.  This was Ghost Vision as I thought that it was on h7, instead.  With that being said, better was 35.Rxc6 which wins another pawn.} b5 {Stopping my a pawn from doing any more harm.  Not earlier, but right here is where I figured out that my a pawn doesn't matter.  And, I easily could've just let it go.  As my attention shifts to my passed pawn. } 36. f5 {So, I advance one of them, right away.} Rb2 {Trying to put pressure on f pawn.} 37. Kg3 {This is the only instance, with which, I don't know what I played.  I thought that I advanced my f pawn again.  But, what I remember is that Tom placed me in check with the next move.  In fact, it's with the same move, meaning that the check occurred on b3.  What I know is that it's only possible for 37...Rb3 to be check, if my K is on g3.} Rb3+ 38. Kg2 {Unlike before, I considered 38.Kg4.  In fact, that is what I almost played, but I didn't want to allow 38...Rb4+, as then, my K would be forced to run back to the third.  Therefore, allowing Tom to continue checking me on the third and forth rank could result in a draw by repetition.  Well, I am determined not to allow a swindle with a draw since I have a win here.} Rd3 {I'm not sure why Tom played this.} 39. f6 {But, it does not matter since I continue to push my passed pawn.} Rd8 {Of course, Tom tries to stop it by bringing the R up since the idea is 40...Rf8 which I have seen on several occassions.  That even included, on one occasion, Homework from Jack Stockel where he made me study something like this.  And, I had to figure out how to prevent him from stopping my passed pawn.} 40. Rf5 {I got it correct, as the solution was bringing the R behind a passed pawn.  He was teaching that this is what you do in endgames.  And, GM Susan Polgar emphasized that in a free course for club players.  Remembering that, nothing else was going to come into consideration here.} Rg8+ {Doing what he can, Tom places me in check.} 41. Kh3 {But, unlike before, this is where I try to take advantage of my opportunity to activate my K since it is a powerful weapon during the endgame.} Rf8 {I'm not surprised to see this move since Tom tries to stop my f pawn.  However, there's nothing he can do to stop it since, as noted earlier, my R is behind that pawn. } 42. Rg6 {This is played knowing that if Tom doesn't move his, R, after moving my f pawn, I have another move which will be played.  This wouldn't have been an option, were that R to remain on h6.} Kb7 {Being worried about the c pawn, Tom plays this to protect it.  But, I could care less about that pawn.} 43. f7 {The reason being is that I am now guaranteed to promote this pawn, as I'll explain shortly.} c5 {Trying to promote, he advances his c pawn.} 44. Rg4 {?! Being worried about a promotion, I play this.  It was a miscalculation, and once again, was a little distracted.  Best was 45.Rg8 as the pawn will promote.  In fact, that's why I played 42.Rg6 as the sequence works.  But, it's not too late.  After this inaccuracy, I figured out that Tom can advance his passed pawn all he wants. } c4 45. Rg8 {As I now play the best move.  With that sequence, what I was keeping in mind was a different Homework assignment from Jack Stockel.  The first one involved a passed pawn.  But, he then, asked what happens if he leaves that R in front of the passed pawn to stop a promotion.  For a while, I wasn't sure, but he said the same thing which is, "Take your time". then I found the best move of bringing the other R right above it.  The idea was to force an exchange which guarantees a promotion.  Well, I remembered that here.  As now, there's no way out.  If Tom just leaves the R there, I'd take.  Then I'd move it to allow the promotion.  So no matter how you look at it, I'm going to Q here.  Surprisingly, Tom does not resign, despite the promotion.} Rxg8 46. fxg8=Q c3 {As Tom is still planning to promote.  But, it doesn't matter, as I have a mating sequence, starting with my next move.} 47. Qd5+ Ka7 {If Tom had gotten out of check with 47...c6, I would answer with 48.Qd7+, and after being forced to bring it back to the eighth rank, I'd mate with 49.Rf8#} 48. Qc5+ {But, it's still mate here, anyway.} Kb7 49. Rf7 {Which is exactly what I kept in mind here.} Ka8 50. Qxc7 {And, that is why I played this given that his K is now stuck in one corner, just like with the N+B mate or mating with both Bishops.  The idea being is that he can't get out.  And, that's the first thing that I kept in mind when playing 47.Qd5+} c2 {This isn't Hope Chess, as he wasn't hoping that I missed the opportunity.  Instead, there was Tunnel as Tom was focused on promoting.  But, he didn't realize that I was going to mate him on my next move.} 51. Qa7# {}
