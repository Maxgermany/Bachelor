[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 {I start off with the usual.} e5 {I wasn't exactly sure how Carl would respond.  He usually answers with the Alkeline Defense which is 1...Nf6.  But, as noted, he's unpredictable since he changes his openings each time.} 2. Nf3 {Since he played what I'm used to, I stick with my usual.  I'm still not sure how Carl is going to answer since he has played the Philidors Defense once and the Petrov once, as well. } Nc6 {But, once he played this, I knew what to do since my knew thing is the Italian or Guaco Piano, as opposed to, the Spanish Opening.  The reason that I stopped playing the Ruy Lopez is that after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5, 3...a6 forces white to exchange B for N.  And, I'm not into exchanging so early because of what kenneth_fiore_3 told me before and during our first training session. } 3. Bc4 d6 {I wasn't sure what to expect from Carl, but one thing is for sure, if he had played 3...Nf6, I would've castled.  I say that because on two occasions, I played 4.Ng5?!  The only reason for that is because Coach Stockel did a lecture on various openings.  He said that this is most analyzed by GM's nowadays because after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4, the only way to prevent a N fork with with 3...Be6  If black bring the N out, 4.Ng5 automatically leads to a fork and wins a R and P since 5.Nxf7 can't be stopped.  But, I think that the glaucoma got him, as I hate to say it, but almost, as often as, I do, he makes mistakes in his analysis.  And, after 4.Ng5, black can stop the threat with 4...d5, so it does become a cheapo tactic, as well.  As now, white only has two pieces out, and what more is that he or she is forced to exchange B for N, anyway.  And, when that happens, black gets a small space advantage because he's not far from castling and can develop, whereas, white has even more work to do to get pieces out and develop.  This happened to me in the first tournament game with Tom Walsh, when I first tried it and didn't end well.  In fact, not exchanging led to a double check and then a mate in 2 or 3, with which, I resigned.  So, I generally will now castle after 3.Bc4, but because Carl played this and only advanced one pawn, I treat it like a Philidor's Defense and go right into the exchange variation starting with my next move.  What also came into consideration was 4.Bb5 to pin his Nc6, but it's not a good enough reason since Carl could, and likely, would break it with 4...Bd7 } 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 Be6 {? Carl played this to prevent me from doubling his pawns on b6 starting with 6.Nxc6.  But, this is a mistake, as first, I'll exchange his B first.  And, it's not because of Jack telling me that a B is worth 3.5 points since, as Charles posted, it's about whether the position is open or not.  The real reason for me exchanging was to remove his f pawn as that's the critical square.  And, this will leave his K to vulnerable to exposure.  But, it gets even better, as I almost miss this opportunity.  Once he recaptures, I can and will win a pawn by recapturing with the B, (7.Bxe6).} 6. Nxe6 fxe6 7. Bxe6 Qe7 {Not liking the position, Carl attacks my B.  Of course, the idea is catching up on developing.} 8. Bd5 Nf6 {?! The reason being is with this move, but it's inaccurate.  The reason is because it'll allow me to liquidate and, this time, double up his b pawns.  Best was 8...Ne5 or 8...Nb4.} 9. Bxc6+ bxc6 10. O-O {Then, I get right to it and castle.  I should spend time developing my Q side, but I feel that K safety is more important.  But, once Carl castles opposite wings, then I continue.} O-O-O 11. Bg5 {I also could've played 11.Nc3  But, the first thing that I kept in mind was the final position between grace_augustine and fiercequeen where Bonnie resigned in that blitz game.  The difference is that this doesn't win a piece, but it ties down Carl's Nf6 and allows me to further liquidate while ahead.} Qe5 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Qg4+ {From that point on, I went for it.  I would've continued developing with 13.Nc3 but delayed a move once I figured out that Carl would be in check.  } Rd7 {?! But, this is not the best way to go.  At first thought, I can see why Carl wanted to interpose.  However, slightly better would've been 13...Kb8 since this leaves his R pinned.  Once that happened, I was going to complete my development once and for all, with my next move.} 14. Nc3 d5 {Going for an exchange.  The idea of exchange while ahead works for pawn, not pieces.  I almost exchanged on d5.} 15. e5 {But, without giving it enough thought, I played this as I thought that I'd be able to keep my passed pawn.  15.exd5 looks better and also came into consideration.  As it turns out, I played the right move but for the wrong reason which is why I'm not giving it an !, like I normally would.  Very similar to what we saw in a variation of Eric's annotation, which Simon corrected, I was also having Ghost Vision here.  For some reason, I thought that my Rf1 was on e1 which was not, and so this appeared to lose a pawn.  Ghost Vision is a little more common for me in a tournament since it's timed.  But, it hasn't happened in a while since the game would end way too quickly.  In fact, Jack said that we all need to slow down and be almost at our last minutes during the tournament.  Many don't agree with that, but I did because only using, for example, 15 or 20 minutes since we ended with 30 or 35 caused me to make mistakes and blunders that shouldn't have been made.  In fact, that's another reason for me annotating these games.  Notating this tournament game where I'm now down to about 25 minutes caused me to have that Ghost vision since I'm going back and forth with the notes and pushing the clock to tell Carl that it's his move.  However, it's worth the efforts for the reason that I noted in the intro of this annotation.  And, as it turns out, this is the right move because of what happens when Carl captures.} Qxe5 {?? This looks like a !, but it's actually a blunder.  I'm not just going to attack, but something nasty is coming with the attack.} 16. Rfe1 {As now, Carl must lose material since his Rd7 is pinned.  So, it has, in reality, become very similar to what we saw between Bonnie and Grace.  It wasn't intended to be that way, but that's how it wound up.  In order to prevent what I'm about to do next, Carl would have to keep his R on the e file which would lose it right away.} Qf6 {But, this is where I figure it out.  Seeing the pin, and given that Carl hasn't developed his Bf8, this is where the check becomes effective.  This gives me an advantage which should win, with best play.  That is, if I don't blunder or use up my time.} 17. Re8+ Qd8 {In fact, Carl said, "I screwed up and I'm now in trouble."  It's true, but he's not giving up.  In this case, he was right not to do it.  But, I would've let the R go because a Q is, generally more valuable.  Yet, he's still losing the equivalent to a R, since after I take he will take back.  I actually think that this outcome is better for black because both R's against the Q is a general draw.  However, I'm up almost the equivalent to a R, but he has the chance to do a lot of damage with both R's which will happen towards the end.  Also, this gives him the equivalent to a pawn so it's +4 for me, but if he had given up an entire R to avoid giving up the Q, it would be a +5 for me which is more.  I'm sure that Carl took note of that.} 18. Rxd8+ Kxd8 19. Qg5+ {Given that Carl got out of the pin, I decided to place him back in check.  Of course, the conditional move is for him to attack with 19...Be7?, as then, I'd answer with 20.Qxg7.  But, black keeps that in mind and plays the best move.} Kc8 20. Qf5 {I also considered 20.Re1, but I played this to repin his R.} g6 {I'm not surprised that Carl attacked.} 21. Qg4 {?? I was still focused on keeping the pin.  But, better was to attack his Rh8 with 21.Qf6.  As now, the only way to protect it is by giving up his c6 pawn.  However, my time is just beginning to run low.  Whereas, Carl has only used 10 minutes which is consistent with the mistakes, I only have, about, 20 minutes left on the clock.  Yet, I think that playing 21.Qf6 would've allowed me just enough time to secure a win, as opposed to, timing out.  The reason being is that after 22.Qxc6, white now threatens to mate with 23.Qa8#  22...Kd8 would stop the threat, but after 23.Qa8+ Ke7 or 23...Ke8 24.Re1+ black, I believe, would run into other problems.  By playing this, Carl can and will defend the pawn with his next move.  Although the move is not terrible, per say, and just not the best, I marked this with 2 queries because this is what will likely cost me the game.  That's because, even if I don't make a terrible mistake, there's now a good chance that I will lose by default, and if I had played 22.Qe6! that wouldn't have happened.} Bd6 22. Qe6 {I try to get a worse form of the pin, but Carl has an easy way out of this on his next move.} Kd8 {I was also ready, just in case, Carl decided to play 22...Kb8?? which I knew he wasn't going to do.  He does make blunders, but a lot of times, he also knows what moves are mistakes.  It's also the case about not trusting the opponent.} 23. Qe3 {After seeing what I had done, and given that his Rd7 is no longer pinned, I now target his a7 pawn and have a threat on the back rank, which is where I'm about to go wrong.  Of course, I only have 17 or 18 minutes before timing out.  I should be optimistic because it's, in theory, a lot of time.  But, the main symptom of having special needs is needing extra time, which is what I used to get on exams when in School and College.  So, more then most, and we're talking about time and a half or double.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist for me here.  What I'm saying is that, whereas, most people would only need the amount of time that I'm explaining, it's not enough for me here.} Re7 {So, Carl attacks my Q and aligns up one of his R's.  What I didn't realize is that he's setting up a threat against my back rank.} 24. Qxa7 {But, this is where I try to follow what Jack says when I feel that there's not enough time.  He said that this is where I need to go quicker to find the winning continuation.  That's because in a different tournament, I had a bigger advantage, materialwise.  In fact, it was won, and I almost had a mating sequence and didn't go wrong.  But, I lost the game on time (timedout).  I use a quartz clock, so it's based on when that small hand that clicks flips passed red flag.  Then, it goes down which signals that you have timed out, and it's lost.  That happened to me on 2 or 3 occasions and didn't want it to reoccur.  So, I'm trying to find the winning continuation.  And, although it's not right here, this is where I start to go wrong.} Rhe8 {I saw it coming since you generally want to double up the R's.  It was just what his intentions were from that.  The idea being is that Jack's told me that two rook on one file is dangerous, but this is the reason why.  But, here's the thing, even I find the right move to avoid mate, I'll probably wind up losing the game on time because finding the win is a little bit harder then it was in the other games where I timed out.  And, I don't have more time then I did in the other games.  Right now, I'm down to, about 16 minutes, whereas, Carl has slightly less then 40.  On the other hand, I reckon that finding a checkmate and win will take, approximately, 20 minutes, which I don't have.} 25. Qa8+ {Having said that, this is the losing blunder, but I'm not giving it quieries due to the likeliness of timing out, anyhow.  It looks like I go wrong on the next move.  But, preventing mate means that I must give up my Q, which now brings me down to a near equivalent of a R.  Opening up a window for my K, as GM Susan Polgar puts it, or giving the K air to breathe, as Jack says, was essential.  Having said that, if I had a little more time, at least 25 minutes, I would've played 25.g3, and I would be able to force a win.  With 25 minutes, I would have just been enough time.  But, I had about 15 minutes left since I resign, and it only takes me a minute or less before that happened.  So, to be exact, I had only 14 minutes when the game ended, but how much time did Carl have?  I'll answer that at the very end.} Kd7 {This was also a conditional move.} 26. Qb7 {?? As I was prepared to play this.  But, the position demanded that I give up my Q which is winning for him.  Similar to an annotation by Eric, combined with a team game that I mentioned in that annotation, this allows a back rank mate.} Re7e1+ {I see it with this move and resign since 27.Rxe1+ is forced which allows him to mate with 27...Rxe1#  I'd normally be very upset that I allowed a swindle and lost a won game with a mistake.  But, the reality is that it was a won position, but I probably would've lost on time.  And, where that happened was with 21.Qg4, and while in it of itself, the move isn't worth two quieries, I gave it that since playing 21.Qe6, right away, more then likely, would've allowed me to find the winning continuation on time.  To be exact, against my 14, Carl had 35 minutes on the clock which means that the game only took him 15 minutes.  And, that was consistent with his first mistake, followed by, the blunder on his 15th which should've costed him the game.  By making that small miscalculation, I had to go a little quicker in an attempt to find the win which is where I overlooked the back rank threat and lost.}
