1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Just played out this game with my buddy Charleshiggie and managed to draw it.  His rating is 1903.  The game was unrated so our ratings were unchanged.  I start off with 1.e4 and he replies e6 giving me the French Defense.} e6 2. f4 {2. f4 - I decide on an unusual variant of the French Defense called the Labourdonnais Variation which has reasonable db results.} d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 {4. Nf3 - development.} Nc6 5. c3 {5. c3 - to prepare a possible d4.} d4 6. Bb5 Nge7 7. O-O Bd7 8. Bd3 Nd5 9. g3 {9. g3 - this creates a pawn chain on the kingside which remains fixed for the remainder of this game.} Be7 10. Be4 Qb6 11. Na3 {11. Na3 - must develop this knight somehow!} dxc3 12. bxc3 {12. bxc3 - pawn trade.} Qa6 13. Kh1 f5 14. Bxd5 exd5 {14. ....... exd5 - this bishop for knight trade has given me a passer on the e file.} 15. Bb2 O-O 16. Nc2 {16. Nc2 - I decide to improve the position of my queen knight.} Qd3 {16. ........ Qd3 - sss and double sss, here's the Wicked Witch of the West!} 17. Ne3 {17. Ne3 - the first stage of a plan to eject the Witch out of my camp!} Be6 18. Qc2 Qe2 {18. ....... Qe2 - declines queen swap and penetrates further into my position, but I will now eject that unwelcome guest with my very next move, 19. Rae1.  The witch retreats to a6.} 19. Rae1 Qa6 20. a4 {20. a4 - preparing Ba3.  I had a similar situation in a game against Coach Ion where I could have played this move but never got round to it, that game was lost, sigh!!  But, maybe I have learned a little lesson there.} c4 21. Rea1 {21. Ra1 - with Charles' last move the Witch's highway into my position has been blocked off by his pawn, yippee!  I now move my rook back to a1 to help Glenda defend the a pawn.} Rf7 22. Ba3 Bd8 23. Bd6 {23. Bd6 - a tentative stab at piece activity and hopefully avoid passivitis!} h6 24. Nd4 Nxd4 25. cxd4 {25. cxd4 - knight trade.} Bb6 26. Qb2 Rc8 27. Nc2 {27. Nc2 - my knight drops back to c2 to assist Glenda in defending the d4 pawn.  I really want to employ Glenda for more interesting duties than defensive ones.} g6 28. Nb4 Qa5 29. Qc3 {29. Qc3 - the Wicked Witch is boxed in!  Pity there is nothing to attack her with.} Kh7 30. Rfb1 {30. Rfb1 - occupying the half-open b file.} Bd7 31. Nc2 {31. Nc2 - indirectly defends the a4 pawn as Bxa4, Qxa5, Bxa5 then Rxa4.  The hind d pawn may drop but I will have netted a piece.} Bc6 32. Qxa5 Bxa5 33. Bb4 {33. Bb4 - after a queen trade I now offer a dark square bishop trade.  Either recapture will look good.  Charles backs it off to c7.} Bc7 34. a5 a6 35. Bc5 {35. Bc5 - Fou Lenoir acts as an extremely useful giant pawn.  The black b7 pawn is now backward.} Re8 36. Nb4 Bb5 37. Kg1 {37. Kg1 - I very nearly fell for it, I very nearly fell for it, but just before I hit the submit button I had a sixth sense.  Thank god it kicked in because if I had played 37. Nxd5?? black's lsb would have pinned my knight against Henry and there would have been no way of saving the knight.  So I threaten to take on c5 by moving Henry off to a safer diagonal, in line with Fou Lenoir.} Rd7 {37. ....... Rd7 - defends the c pawn.  I now move Henry to f2 which is a good square for the king because if the g file is opened up then my b1 rook could move to g1 to stop a rook invasion down the g file.  Charles retreated his bishop to b8 then offered me a draw which I gladly accepted!} 38. Kf2 Bb8 {}
