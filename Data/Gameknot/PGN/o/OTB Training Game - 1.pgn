[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C61), Bird's defence, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nd4 4. Nxd4 exd4 5. O-O c6 6. Ba4 {Unlike before, this opponent's style is, somewhat, well known to me.  So, I anitcipated that this is where it would be end up.  I calculated and knew what to do.  Sure, it's not practice where you play through the variations.  Instead, it's the real deal where the moves were made during the last game.  And, using memory techniques, like I did in a couple of endgames, homework assignments, and studies from unusual openings, I remembered what happened last time, and applied it for this.  Therefore, I was well prepared.} Bd6 {With that being said, I anticipated 6...b5, in which case, I would've played 7.Bb3 which is the most common place to run back.  But, Bernie played this, which is also a good move as it develops.} 7. d3 {So, I develop with the plan being to develop my N and bring it to a better outpost, like I've done before.  This also acheives a good pawn chain, which I didn't think was important, until the end game.  But, I learned shortly afterwards, from a lecture by Susan Polgar.  What she implied is that a pawn chain is very important during the openings.} Qh4 {?! As I also know, things can get in the way of your long term plans.  When things intercede, you take care of threats, and find forcing moves.  With that being said, this is an inaccuracy by black because he stopped developing and brought his Q out way to early.  I know the intention as it's similar to SM.  But, he wants to mate, but this is what we call a cheapo tactic and unsound. } 8. g3 {I had a little difficulty between this and 8.h3, which also would've protected against the threat.  But, after giving this time and thought, I decided to play this.  The reason being is to punish Bernie for his last move.  By doing this, not only do I refute the threat, but now I'm gaining a tempo needed for development, as the Q needs to protection.  And, timing is important.} Qe7 9. Nd2 {So, as noted, I used the time to continue my development.} b5 {Now, he plays, what I anticipated on his sixth move.  So, I respond the same way that I mentioned then.} 10. Bb3 Bb7 11. Qg4 {My goal is not to win the g pawn, as it appears.  If it were just that, I wouldn't play this as it would be unsound.  I knew black would defend in the way he is, in which case, I knew that I could waist a little more of his time.  By doing so, I'm able to find a better outpost for my N which was the real idea behind this move.  I also could have done that here, but my goal was doing in such a way where the mobility of my Q isn't as limited.  That's because it now has more places to manoeuvre, and as we know, mobility is very important.  In addition, when I also kept in mind that 11...h5 or 11...f5 won't help against the threat I have.  If they did, I also would not have played this.  So, I really do gain tempo, and thus, find a good place for my Q} g6 12. Nf3 O-O-O {? After the game, Bernie told me that he prefers to castle short, just like me.  But, with the pressure on the K side, castling K side would be quite risky and would, likely, get him into trouble.  So, he had to castle on opposite wings.  However, castling could've waited a move later.  Better was 12...c5, better was 12...Bc5 because this move loses a pawn.  In fact, seeing that I won the same pawn last time, and in a similar position, I did not anticipate this, at all.  In other words, I thought that he would play these moves so that I could not take since I was able to do this, last time.  Then, he would castle, on his next move.  } 13. Nxd4 h5 {Getting aggressive and seeing, having defended his h R, and seeing now that my Q is in a bad spot, now he attacks.} 14. Qf3 {I was not going to play 14.Qh3 because black would threaten ...g4 which would lose tempo, as he'd likely, answer with 14...g5, right away.  I also considered 14.Qe2, but this, however, gives the K better protection.  More importantly is that black can play 14...c5, and if he did that, I would retreat with 15.Ne2.  But, if I retreated my Q to e2, it would no longer be an option, so I'd have to play 15.Nf3 in which case, it's now safe to say that the N would be a little crammed.  And, if not, I'd feel a little uncomfortable and overwhelmed which I was not going to allow.  In addition, although this was not my main goal, I am now threatening 15.Qxf7  However, it come to mind because of the inaccuracy I made by not playing Ng5 a move earlier which allowed him to defend much more easily.  But, by retreating here, unlike before, it's not so easy, and black will still have to struggle, which is something, if I recall correctly, that ION noted, last time.  The idea is that, when ahead, in addition to liquidation of pieces, you also want to put pressure on your opponent and make it more difficult to defend his position since the idea being, as I also learned from Susan is improving your position.} Rf8 {Black also could've advanced his f pawn.  But, this is the most common to defend it, as it usually involves the R.} 15. Bf4 {Wanting to increase the pressure, liquidate, and eliminate my bad bishop, I play this.  I also considered 15.Bg5, but this time, when mentioning it, I did not overlook that it would be blunder.  That's because even without analyze the board, I accurately saw that it would a piece.  With that being said, if 15.Bg5??, 15...f6 16.Bh4, g5 and the B is locked in, and thus, trapped. } Bxf4 {?! I am surprised, however, that he played this.  And, I view it as an inaccuracy because not only do I liquidate B's while ahead, but this is his strong B because the other, for now, is confined to b7 and c6, so it has less mobility.  But, my DSB is weaker then my LSB since the B on lightsquares is on a long diagnol, that you'd typically see from a fianchetto and can, in the long run, do some damage.  Better was to attack my N as this would give him the time needed to complete development, and at the very least, prevent me from exchanging.  In addition, I'm going to take back with my Q because if 15...gxf4 will leave my K too wide open, and I lost a game against Jack by making a mistake like that.  Second, this strengthens my Q structure.  However, it is, as we know, an interesting position, so anything can change.} 16. Qxf4 f6 {?! I don't why he played this, but I view it as another inaccuracy.  First, black could've completed his development, at once, with 16...Nf6  Second, I can liquidate further with that initiative, and in the process, it will no longer be possible for him to complete development.  With that being said, I'm confident that I have a win, yet, as I've mentioned, I'll be careful, won't take risky chances, or underestimate what he's capable of doing. } 17. Bxg8 Rfxg8 18. Rfe1 {So, this is where I decide to, like before, attack the center.  } Qe5 {?! He is probably trying to find a forcing move, but in my opinion, this is another inaccuracy, as it will allow me to trade Q's, while I'm ahead.  I think that best 18...g5 which would gain tempo for him, as now I have something to be weary of.  BTW, unlike the last game, I considered 19.Nf3? but the reason I didn't play it is that he would win back a pawn and isolate my pawns 19...Qxb2, which was something that I wasn't going to allow.} 19. Qxe5 fxe5 {Naturally attacking my pawn.} 20. Nf3 {So, I don't just retreat anymore.  Instead, like with what you'd typically see from a GM, I reattack, in the process.} d6 {Achieving another pawn chain which strengthens his connected pawns, in the process.} 21. Ng5 {The idea here is applying what I've learned.  So, the plan is, should things stay like this, 22.Nf7  This time, however, I miscalculated because when playing this, I thought it would be 22.Nf7+, since it appears to be a check which would also be a fork.  Therefore, I thought that Bernie would be forced to compromise his position and waste more tempo to prevent the threat.  I miscalculated because 22.Nf7 isn't a fork as it lands on the same square as the K.  Therefore, he'd still be able to get out of it, in which case, he might, for all I know get some initiative back, as now, I'm the one that would lose tempo.} Kd7 {We are not in an endgame, yet, so I am not sure why he played this.  Without getting overconfident, this is where I start thinking that I could cause a lot of damage since the K appears exposed.  Of course, you can sometimes survive.  But, I was seeing if I could do something to force a win since there appears to be a potential weakness.  However, this isn't so, and black has ways.} 22. Re3 {So, I play this with a long term plan.  The plan is organize my R, and N.  In this case, leave the N where it was place black in check on the seventh rank with my R.  Therefore, what I'm implying is an eventual Rf7+ which would cause further damage on black's damage.} Rgf8 {However, black sees my plan and stops it with this move.  } 23. Rae1 {I decide to double up since it's known to be dangerous.  But, better was 23.Rf3, with the idea of liquidation since I'm still ahead.} Bc8 {I anticipated 23...Rb8 which adds a defender to his B.  But, with this move, I now play what  I could've a move earlier, and therefore, am able to exchange.} 24. Rf3 {Of course, black doesn't have to take, but when he does, I take back.} Rxf3 25. Nxf3 Ke7 {Now that we're in an endgame, it makes sense for black to bring his K out.  However, I'm not ready to do that, quite yet.} 26. Nh4 {Thinking about forced moves, the plan is to win the g pawn.  Not surprised that black protects, but when he does, I have a plan.  I also thought it'd be difficult to defend g6, which would require the loss of tempo.  However, the K can do even more then it might appear, which is where I also miscalculate.  Nontheless, I knew that he was going to protect, and I have ideas for when he does.} Kf6 27. Re3 {This is it, and now, I'm planning long term.  The idea is that, eventually, I can reposition my N on f3, whilst, leaving my R active on the f file.  The plan behind is to be able to do damage on the sixth and seventh, if and when, I can deliver a dangerous check.} Kg7 {But, once he plays this, however, I know that the feasibility is gone.  Therefore, I will repost my N on f3, immediately and see if I can find anything else.} 28. Nf3 Be6 {I almost overlooked it and played the wrong move.  But, I figured it out before making the mistake.  His plan is to win back a pawn and isolate my good pawns.} 29. b3 {I also considered 29.a3, but this move leaves with a better pawn structure, in my opinion, as now it is easy to get a solid pawn chain, whereas, it's would be more difficult with the other move.} a5 {To connect his other two pawns.} 30. Ng5 {Not even to win his B, as he easily has ways out.  However, without any miscalculation, the plan works because retreating will lose tempo.  And, once he does this, I come up with a different threat, so Rf3, which  I will play right after was the idea behind this move.} Bd7 31. Rf3 {The idea being that I'm now threatening 32.Rf7+  Of course, he can do something, especially with 31...Be8  But, there would be a lot of pressure on the seventh rank which would be almost overwhelming to black.  He can, however, do something about it, but the entire plan was to put him under pressure.  The idea being is that when under pressure, you tend to make mistakes which is what gives the opponent a bigger advantage.} Rf8 {?! I am surprised that he responds with this move.  I would've played 31...Be8, in this position.  By playing this, however, I once again, liquidate.  This time, our remaining R's, not to mention that he hasn't gotten anything back, yet.} 32. Rxf8 Kxf8 33. f4 {So, the plan is now to get rid of his remaining pawns with exchanges.  I remembered from a couple of games, one or two against Jack, and one against dmaestro that one pawn can make or break a game.  Therefore, if we get rid of pawns, and I have one extra, I might be able to win.  Of course, however, Bernie is a very difficult opponent, and not to my surprise, will get out of this.} Kg7 {Trying to put pressure on my N, but before he can do that, I will take.  Now, I did consider 33.f5, but with an added defender, he would get back in pawn.  In other words, if 34.f5, 34...gxf5, and if 35.exf5, black has 35...Bxf5  Then I looked to see if these variations would lead to a passed pawn, afterwards, but they don't.  If, however, I were to get a passer from that, then I would've played the latter move.  Therefore, as a result of my decision not to give him back pawn, for now, I will exchange, right away.} 34. fxe5 dxe5 35. Nf3 {Still remembering what happened last time where I didn't play Ng5 a move earlier, and at the same time, applying what I learned about forcing moves, I decide to play this.  That's because I knew ahead of time that black must do something to protect e5.} Kf6 {As anticipated.} 36. d4 {? Knowing that I'm still a pawn up, I, once again, decide to force an exchange and for the same reason.  The idea is remaining up a pawn, whilst, getting rid of his pawns.  I also thought that, when all was said and done, I'd have a passed pawn since the e pawn will be there without other pawns in front of, or right next to it.  However, I miscalculated because with this exchange, Bernie will win back a pawn.  I think that best was 36.c4, and even if we don't exchange, I'm still remain ahead by a pawn.} exd4 37. Nxd4 Ke5 {That's because of this fork, as now, I have to give up my e pawn, in order to keep my N alive. } 38. Ne2 Kxe4 39. c4 {Therefore, I'm now trying to get a draw.  The goal here is for a dead position.  So, what I'm trying to do is get rid of our pawns, and perhaps his N with my B.  That isn't however, my real goal, but is to eliminate all pawns, and with it, the game should end in a dead position.  } bxc4 40. bxc4 Kd3 {Not surprised that he played this.  At first, I thought that I was going to go from a pawn up to a pawn down.  But, at the last minute, I find a way around it which is always what one should do, anyhow.} 41. Nf4+ {This is it.  That's because black can and will take.  When he does, capture on c4, I will recapture on g6.} Kxc4 42. Nxg6 Kb4 {Going after my a pawn.} 43. Ne5 {So, I'll do what I can to protect it.  } Be8 {This is what I'm alluding to.  I'm not sure why he moved there, but I would've played 43...Ka3! winning that pawn, at last.} 44. Kf2 {Best was 44.Nd3+  That's because black can now win that pawn, with no way for white to stop it, should Bernie find the right move.} a4 {Best was 44...Ka3! winning a pawn.  But, he put a finger, with the inference based on gesture is wait a minute.  And, then, he found a different move.  The plan, was to promote, but it would be easier, had he taken.  } 45. Nd3+ {At last, I played what I mentioned earlier.  The idea being is that everything remains even, for now.} Ka3 {Still trying to win my pawn.  So, I ask myself what can be done to protect a2.  As it turns out, there is only one way to do so, for now.} 46. Nc1 {And, I find the move.  But, what I miscalculated, however, was blacks next move.  As it turns out, he is going to win the pawn afterall, by forking my pawn and N.} Kb2 {Consequently, there is no way around it.} 47. Ne2 Kxa2 48. Nf4 {This is where I thought I was lost.  But, I am still going to do what I can for counterplay.  In other words, instead of thinking about resignation, I'm being, as brave as, possible.  So, now it's about becoming aggressive and trying to stay in, even if, it means hope chess.  That's because, in reality, I'm hoping to get counterplay.  } c5 {The idea is that he has a passed pawn, and as we know, "Passed pawns must be pushed."} 49. h3 {?? Seeing how dangerous his pawns are, I was trying to prevent his h pawn from becoming a passer.  But, according to Jack, which he says after the game was over, this was the losing blunder.  Best was 49.Nd3, and if 49...a3, white can respond with 50.Nc2, preventing that pawn from promoting.  In which case, despite being a pawn down, the game might have ended in a draw.  But, by playing this, black can and will be able to promote, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.} a3 {With that being said, he starts advancing.} 50. g4 {But my plan, as it was, before is to exchange because afterwards, I will have a passed pawn.  Well, he will exchange, but it doesn't matter as his passed pawn is more dangerous then my passer.} hxg4 51. hxg4 Kb3 {That's because, as noted, black can Q.  This is where I start thinking about resigning, but will wait, until he plays ...a2.} 52. g5 {With that being said, I race and now try to promote, or at the least, win a piece.  That's because I'm leaving my N there, intending to play g6, and if ...Bxg6, that's when I'd take the B.} a2 {But, once he plays this, I resign.  The reason being is that black is going to promote before I'd be able to Q.  As a result, he is going to win material and will be able to mate.  Overall, I enjoyed this game, and Bert said that he enjoyed playing with me, again.  But, this is what we learned, based on what Jack said right after my resignation.  When you're opponent is up a pawn, has a passer, but both players have a piece, it is important to stop that passed pawn with your piece.  Otherwise, he or she will promote, in which case, all hopes are lost.}
