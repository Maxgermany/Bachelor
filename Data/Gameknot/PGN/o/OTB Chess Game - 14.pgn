[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 {Similar to what we always see, it started off with the Ruy Lopez.  Usually, I answer with 4.Ba4, in response to, 3...a6  This time, I deviated from the mainline.  Doubled pawns was not for the reason, for if that were the intention, I wouldn't have considered this.  The real reason is that I'm going to win a pawn because his N will no longer be there to defend e4.  Of course, he can get it back, but something told me that it wasn't going happen since he had missed threats, before.  And, it happened again.} bxc6 5. Nxe5 f6 {?? That's because 5...Qe7 is what would've gotten it back.  Losing a pawn is generally enough for me to only give it one query.  But, there's something else alluming here.  For a while, this was where I wasn't sure what he played.  Originally, I had 5...e6 recorded, but that pawn has been exchanged.  Then, I speculated 5...d6, but then what gets played would not have been possible.  After looking at it and studying what it was for, at least, an hour, I figured out that this is exactly what he played.  And, it is a blunder, as opposed to, just a mistake.  The reason being is that this is his weakest pawn.  By moving here, Ted's K side is already weakened, as he'll run into problems should and when he castles K side.  And, when someone exposes their monarch, I don't show lienency as the idea is trying to expose the weakness that the opponent leaves for him or herself which is already starting to happen.  It's not happening at the very moment, but that will change soon. } 6. Nf3 c5 {Advancing the pawn.  My guess is that Ted wants to reduce his doubled pawns.  However, Jack did get a little involved and advised him to try to do something with those doubled pawns as they can become a reliability.  We will see that later.} 7. O-O {So, I immediately step on the gas and castle.} g6 {?! Very understandable as he wants the long flank for his Bf8 which is why fianchettos are common.  But, much better was to bring his Bf8 into play, at once.  For one thing, this is waisting tempo.  More importantly, however, is that this exacerbating the exposure creating a further weakness for his monarch.} 8. Nc3 {Therefore, I continue with my development.  The idea is trying to control the center as that is a way to exploit a weakness, like this.} c6 {Advancing his other c pawn.} 9. d3 {So, I step back on the gas.  As now, it's as though, c2-c3 and d3-d4 plan happened.  But, in a slightly different form because we have the solid pawn chain.  However, the overall picture is that this is a center pawn, and it enables me to complete my development which is going to start making Ted's problems visible. } Bb7 {Placing his Bishop on the longest diagonal.} 10. Be3 {Completing my development.  With that being said, I have complete control over my center.  And, this is the cornerstone to where I start figuring what kind of damage I can cause for black and with more then one variation.} Bd6 {Continuing with his development.  BTW, this is where I also figured out that black played 5...f6  At first, I thought it was 5...d6, but had that been played, he would not have been able to bring his DSB here as the d pawn would block his Bf8 from coming here.  In other words, it would only be possible to play 10...Bg7, or 10...Be7, but this is how he answered which is where I figured out his 5th move since the N was attacked.} 11. Na4 {Seeing one way to exploit the weakness, I place my N on the rim.  And, forget the saying about them being rim.  It's sometimes good to know.  But, other times, it's just a guideline.  With that being said, I decided that this was the time to deviate from that guideline because, at the very least, I'm now taking advantage of those doubled pawns.} Ne7 {? Developing another piece.  But, this is a mistake.  Not only do I exploit those doubled pawns, but this will lose one of them, in the process, leaving him two pawns down.  Plus, after my 13th move.  For that reason, best was 11...Qe7.  However, I believe that Ted did not consider this since his focus might have been to complete the development, but missed the threat.  Yes, my opponent is like this which I can understand all too well.  That's because I had that problem until my loss against bhidragon, which I'll show later in this annotation.  And, then, it occurred with other losses that you focus on guidelines but miss something that's more important, so as to say, not seeing the overall picture of what the board is revealing.} 12. Bxc5 Bxc5 13. Nxc5 Bc8 {Protecting his LSB.} 14. Re1 {And, that's when I use that time to centralize the Rook.  Afterall, one way of maintaining center control is to have one of the rooks in the center.} d6 {Attacking my Nc5.} 15. Nb3 {So, I protect.} O-O {?! And, he castles.  Generally speaking this is a solid move, as that's what you want to do.  But, the problem here is that his monarch is, as noted, weakened due to Ted playing 5...f6??, followed by 6...g6  By playing this move with a weakened King, I will now have an attacking force, or another of saying it is a monster buildup against his monarch.} 16. Qd2 {As this is a cornerstone to that because of what's going to happen on my next move.} Bb7 {Bringing his B back to where it was.} 17. Qh6 {But, this is where I actually start finding Ted's weaknesses.  I did find other's with hanging pawns, which is how I wound up ahead.  In this context, however, I'm alluding to winning lines caused by an exposed King.  And, it starts with this move.  That's because in my last game against bhidragon, my monarch was, likewise, weakened due to an inaccuracy.  I did not see those attacking forces which lost.  So, when I played the wrong move, he answered by putting pressure on my monarch.  It started with the exact same move which is why I played this.  I also remembered Ken saying that you don't do something just because it worked in one game.  Unfortunately, I had to, regretfully, view that as not applicable to me since I played the same move that turned out to be a mistake against dynamic_dv as it worked in a different game, before.  Did the same thing which worked.  And, it works here, as well.  The idea being is that when bhidragon played this move, my R appeared attack, although protected by the monarch.  However, the attack happened against my K.  So, being able to play this same move, I'm pretty sure that I can now win.  I'm just calculating a winning line which doesn't take me long to find.  } a5 {My guess is that Ted wants a passed pawn since the idea is clearing my pawns on the a and b files with exchanges as that's what he's done before.} 18. Nbd4 {But, this is where I start figuring out a follow up after 17.Qh6 to exploit his weakness.  It's a little unsound, though, as Ted can stop it with 18...Bc8  That's is the best move due to what happens soon.  With that being said, however, I figured that he'd miss this because once this opponent advances a pawn, he continues which happened here.  And, that will turn out to be a serious because of...} a4 19. Ne6 {This move, as now, he's either going to lose his Queen for Knight or get checkmated.} Qc8 {Not to my surprise, either, however, Ted protects his Queen but misses bigger threat of mate.  I say that because when he sees something attacked, he'll protect, but has missed mating threats like this.} 20. Qg7# {Right after this game, Jack commented and said to Ted, "You let him in", which is the same thing that happened against bhidragon with his army that swarmed in against my King.  So, the lessons to be learned from this game are to figuring out what the opponent might be threatening.  For example, Ted focused on trying to get a passed pawn but overlooked the Knight fork with 19.Ne6.  More importantly, however, is what we saw in charleshiggie's most recent annotation as what occurred is, more or less, the same idea, in my books.  That is, to not leave yourself with an exposed King.  Another example is that, similar to the Dominao Defense, he played ...f6??, with the idea of hitting my N.  The problem is that he lost a pawn, and it weakend his monarch.  And, when Ted played 8...g6?! he further weakend his King.  In doing so, it was an open target for me to swarm in, especially when he castled later because of my attacking forces against it.}
