1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 {It was all mainlines, until now.  But, I wasn't sure how to continue.  So, my idea was to put pressure on Ted since pressure is about not knowing what to do.  I thought he'd undue it by exchanging with 3.exd5} 3. e5 {But, by playing this, "The pressure stays on" as Kenneth_fiore_3 put it in my training game with him, and I'm happy about the pressure.} e6 {As this isn't pressure for me, but rather, the move that I was planning to play after 3.e5  The idea is to keep it on.  Similar to what Ken also said, I'm also interested in how Ted handles this.} 4. a3 {In my books, he did not do it the right way, as this does not develop or help control the center.  I think that better was to develop something.  As white, I would've played 4.Nf3, or brought my Bf1 into play for the plan of castling short.} Ne7 {So, I try to take advantage with this move since it does bring me a step closer to castling.  I don't like the N here since it appears cramped.  But, the only other alternative was to place my on the rim with 4...Nh6?? which could expose the K since Ted could punish this with 5.Bxh6, and after 5...gxh6, I'm in a lot of trouble.  However, I also kept in mind something that Ken and Susan Polgar told me as there will be a better spot for my Ne7 to undue the cramped position.} 5. c4 {Trying to exchange pawns.} Nf5 {But, I hold back due to Ken's advice since the idea is not being so ready to exchange as I don't know how that would affect the endgame.  Therefore, I use that opportunity to get the N better placed, as it appears.  But, I overlooked something bigger.  This was a little fixation, but what happens after Ted's next move?} 6. g4 Nh4 {I'm forced to place it on the rim since he attacked again.  The only other options were 6...Ne7 (but I didn't want my N cramped again.)  Or, 6...Nh6 (but I didn't want to risk the K exposure.)  So, this was played in anticipation of white's next move.  In other words, 7.Nf3 was an equivalent to a conditional move since I know my opponent.} 7. Nf3 Nxf3+ {Consequently, this is where I just go for this as I'm now ready to exchange.  I felt that his N was stronger then mine.  So, by allowing this, I feel that I already have a small advantage.} 8. Qxf3 Be7 {So, I continue my development.  This time, I was too fixated as I overlooked something that would've won a pawn.} 9. Be2 {Continuing with his development.  Likewise, however, Ted also overlooked that pawn being in danger.  Best was 9.Nc3  Yes, it also develops, but more importantly, it was the only way to protect his c pawn.  Therefore, I take.} dxc4 10. Bxc4 {Figuring that I didn't win anything, Ted took back.  But, he overlooked my next move, as now, I'm up a pawn.} Qxd4 11. O-O {?? Getting, I believe, fixated on K safety (which in general, is important) he castled.  Normally, it's a good move, but in this context it's a blunder.  In fact, Ted said, "Oops, I gave away my pawn."  By that, he was alluding to e5.} Qxc4 {So, I said that I don't need that pawn because I can win a piece.  When I took here, Ted was shocked because his jaw dropped.} 12. h3 {I'm not sure why he played this, as this doesn't help with his development.} O-O {So, I take advantage by castling, as now, it's safe to do so.} 13. Rd1 {Centralizing his Rook.  } Qc5 {And, I put some pressure on him.  That's because if his Queen moves other then where it is, his f2 will remain pinned.} 14. Qc3 {But, Ted plays this instead.  My guess is that he want's my Queen off.  With that being said, what Ken previously mentioned about no longer applies.  If I feel ready, I'm just going to do it.  The idea is liquidating while ahead.  Not always, but more often then not, it's to one's benefit because of what happens in the endgame, as will be the case here.  Therefore, knowing that I can, I just go for it and exchange Queens.} Qxc3 15. Nxc3 Nd7 {I don't like cramming my N, but the only other way to develop, would've been bringing it on the rim.  I won't do that, unless the position demands it, which isn't happening here.} 16. f4 {I'm not sure why Ted played this as he's not going to bring his monarch into action.  And, it's not an endgame.} b6 {?! Wasn't exactly sure how to do this, but I'm feeling some pressure since I don't what to do.  Since it's not a training game where it's my teacher, I play whatever my instincts tell me to play.  And, it was this move since I'm starting to formulate a plan for the pawn chain.  But, better might have been 16...b5 as that chain is there.  I think that the best move, however, would've been 6...Nb6 as my N is better placed, at once.  I guess what it boils down is that in situations like this since I've never considered this before, to think of a regular game like a specific training game.  As training is practice.  It's about, "wake up and smell the coffee" as tactical-abyss puts it since it's about reality. } 17. g5 {I think that Ted's trying to take advantage of my weakness with those dark square controls.} Nc5 {Figuring what happened, in the aftermath, I bring my N to a better spot, at once.} 18. Rb1 {He plans to attack my N since there is added pressure.  Since I'm not with the program, and just go by instincts...} Ba6 {I played this.  The problem is that, like with bhidragon, I got fixated on completing my development.  What I didn't realize, until Ted's next move was missing something that the board was trying to tell me. } 19. b4 {Which was an attack on my N.  And, this is where I start blundering.} Bd3 {That's because, instead of retreating, I attack his Rook.  Similar to what happened with the game against dynamic_dv, where I pin f7 since it happened in a different game and turned out to be a mistake, something happened here.  Ok, so instead of retreating, I attacked something worth more.  The reason is because in some of charleshiggie's games, he's attacked.  In other words, his opponent attacks, let's supposed, his Bishop or Rook.  Instead of retreating, he reattacked something worth more, which was the Queen.  It worked.  But, the problem is that I forgot something that Ken said way back in time, which is that you have to base it on the position and not what was played in that game.  Not only did I forget that, but I, on the other hand, completely disregarded the position, almost as though, it didn't matter.  That's not a good way to think but don't what Jack was talking about here.  I reanalyzed it, and this time, it works out.  So, it was a good move but for the wrong reason.  Now, Jack Stockel started watching this game and got interested due to me being a piece and pawn up early.  But, he got upset me, when I played this move.  Unlike other games, he wasn't going to make us end and start a new game since he was playing a different game, and Tom was bound to show up.  Don't be fooled, however, as he was just upset.  In fact, it was enough for him to lose interest in this game as he was bound to walk away.  Don't know why, but my guess is that Jack thought I threw away my advantage.  But, I reanalyzed what was going here.  That's because if 20.Rxd3?, 20...Nxd3, and if 20.bxc5??, 20...Bxb1} 20. Rb2 {Jack, however, watched this move.  But, afterwards, he completely lost interested in our game.  In it, Mr. Stockel accurately asked, "What are you doing Ted."  In other words, he rightly implied that my last move was a blunder that should've given him back a piece.  What he was accurately alluding to is the fact that best was 20.bxc5  Even more shocking is that when making the blunder, I calculated through that line but overlooked something vital which is another reason for the blunder.  What I figured is, ok, 20.bxc5, and then I'll play 20...Rxd3, and it's still liquidation.  But, I overlooked 21.cxb6, axb6 and then 22.Rxb6 and white has still got something back.} Ne4 {?? Because of what Jack originally thought, which on Friday I agreed with due to a rough week, I displayed, what I'll call, an impulsive act of Hope Chess which wasn't necessary. That's because Hope Chess is when your opponent has a nasty threat like this, but instead of calculating, you just hope that he or she doesn't spot it.  Yes, I made a mistake and was just hoping that Ted wouldn't see this.  What I forgot is that he could win a piece, as opposed to, a pawn.  At first, I thought that I was in danger of losing a piece and was hoping that I wouldn't lose it.  But, it was a pawn, as opposed to, a piece that was in danger.  Now, a piece is hanging.  However, keeping in mind what Jack was saying, I was hoping for something.  The way for Ted to win a piece (so the threat) is 21.Rxd3  But, because of what my coach previously said, I was praying that he'd overlook that and take my N, so that, I could then liquidate and remain a piece and pawn up.  I was lucky that it happened here.  On the other hand, my thought process was quite bad and wouldn't have worked against more experienced player.  It was the combination of feeling a little rushed and impulsive after the way that Jack acted combined with the past two or three works day which turned rough.  So, what happened with this move was essentially what I feared would occur in my game against Ken.  And, that upsets as Ted could've won back a piece here.} 21. Nxe4 Bxe4 22. Rd7 {Doing what he can to compensate for lost material, Ted attacks my Be7.} Rfe8 {Before his last move, I considered 22...Rad8 with the idea of threatening to win a piece.  But, 22.Rd7 stopped as, unlike before, I am not going to blunder or make a mistake, this time around.  And, the reason behind this move, as opposed to, 22...Rae8, is that, it will allow me to centralize my other Rook (bring the other rook to d8).} 23. Rbd2 {Meanwhile, Ted doubles up, which is, in general, a good idea.} Rad8 {? And, I centralize my other Rook, as noted on my 22nd.  More importantly, however, I'm, once again, going to exchange due to being ahead.  Ted just doesn't realize.  On the other hand, it is a mistake as Ted does win back a pawn.  Unlike before, I am not bothered by this because, no matter how you slice, it's not, as Ken put it, there's not enough compensation which I, happily, keep at the front of my mind.  The reason for this was due to the Hope Chess that worked since that N was exchanged.  In doing so, he's now left without enough pieces which is why it's generally a good idea to liquidate pieces when ahead.  If this, however, were a piece and he had more on the board, like before, it would be a different story. } 24. Rxa7 { } Rxd2 {As now, there's no way to avoid the exchange of Rooks.} 25. Bxd2 g6 {I open up.  Before this, I was calculating one or two sets of variations, forgot what they were.  But, they could've both ended in a back rank mate if his Rook got up there.  So, I put a stop to it because as Ken mentioned, calculating multiple variations, as opposed to, one, is important, which I learned the hard way in a different game that I lost.} 26. Kh2 {Bringing his monarch into the corner since it's safe there.  More importantly, however, is that it's an endgame, and the monarch plays a powerful role in that phase of the game.} Rd8 {Now the back rank is protected (but not remembering what exact variations they were) the threat of pinning, and even, winning that Bishop is back.  The other idea is that he can take the Bishop, but that would mean that I take back on d2.  And, my idea is, as usual, my readiness to liquidate.} 27. Be3 {Not to my surprise, however, Ted prevents this.} Bf8 {So, I also protect my B.} 28. a4 {Ted's idea is exchanging pawns which I will accept since I enjoy exchanges, anyhow.  Plus, when he does back, I've got a nasty surprise for him.} Bxb4 29. Bxb6 Rd2+ {Starting with this move.  But, either way, I still have a mating sequence.} 30. Kg3 {I say that because had Ted played 30.Kg1, my next move would still be the same.  From there, I don't know how mate could be avoided, unless I'm missing something in the variation which is very typical for me.} Rg2+ 31. Kh4 Be1+ {Believe it or not, I did announce checkmate since the King cannot move.  I overlooked one move, but he resigned here as we both thought it was mate.  Therefore, I'm continuing this annotation, as though he played that move and I mated anyhow, as that's how the game would've ended.} 32. Bf2 Bxf2# {With that being said, despite the mistakes I had, the lesson to be learned is still the same.  Therefore, the moral of this story is word of advice that chesskingdom64 gave to me.  "The openings must used with the greatest care.  What you do in the opening will affect you in the midgame; what you do in the midgame will affect you in the endgame; and what you do in the endgame will affect you in the endgame."  That's what happened here because Ted blundered in the opening which, indirectly (since he overlooked my errors) took it's toll here.}
