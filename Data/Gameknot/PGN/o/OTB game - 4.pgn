[White "Weak Player (1200)"]
[Black "schakertje (1705)"]
[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 c6 {So here it is: the caro-kann. After white's next move, black will almost always play d5 to get a good center, and good development.} 2. Nf3 {Main line is 2d4. White is not a player that studies openings.} d5 3. d3 {Better was probably Nc3 to defend the pawn, this loses the pawn, or trade queens and white can't castle.} dxe4 4. dxe4 Qxd1+ 5. Kxd1 {And that is exactly what happens. White cannot castle, although the chess game database still favors white. I think it's because white can develop his pieces very fast while black has a little trouble with it.} Bg4 6. Be2 Nd7 {I didn't play this because I wanted to castle long, but because I wanted to have my rook on d8. I believe castling long is weaker than castling short, so I will try to castle short here, although it will take a while.} 7. h3 Bh5 8. g4 {This move seems to weaken white's kingside.} Bg6 9. Nc3 Ngf6 {I was not too happy about this move. My knight doesn't have much places to go, but I decided to play it anyway. It attacks white e-pawn.} 10. Be3 Nxe4 {white did not defend the pawn so I take it. I decided to take with my knight because my bishop was more valuable.} 11. Nxe4 {white decided to trade pieces. I think that is acceptable here.} Bxe4 12. Rg1 {White did not want to have his rook pinned, and probably wanted to play with his knight. Ng5 would be a strong move, thats why I played h6.} h6 13. c3 {White now wanted to move his queen side pawns. That is a bad idea because he does not have a strong attack with it, and it weakens white's defense. Meanwhile I decide to continue development and castling.} e6 14. Ke1 {White wants to use the d-file for the rook.} Be7 15. Rd1 Rd8 {I need to do this move before I castle. If I don't he plays the simple Rxd7. Also if white plays Bxa7, I would play b6 and the bishop has a problem.} 16. Bd4 {he attacks the g-pawn, but this allows me to finish my opening by castling.} O-O 17. Nd2 {White attacks my bishop. I was thinking about f5, but I decided to play it easy.} Bc2 {I decided to move my bishop away. This is a move to put white's rook off the strong d-file.} 18. Rc1 Bg6 {This is better than moving the bishop to g6 on the 17th move, because now the rook is off the d-file and it takes another move to get it back there.} 19. b4 {but white decides to play with his queen-side pawns.} c5 {I felt this was a strong move because my pieces would be more active after bxc5 Bxc5.} 20. Be3 {white did not take} Rdc8 {Adding fuel on the fire.} 21. a3 {This move is not a good move as you will see.} cxb4 22. axb4 Bxb4 {white's pawn is pinned, so white lost another pawn.} 23. Bd4 {this is another bad move.} e5 {This is the time where white didn't see any hopefull things. But continued playing with a good move.} 24. Nb3 {This move is good because it defends the rook! If I play exd4, then cxb4, and the rook is not pinned anymore} Ba3 {I decided to attack the rook} 25. Rc2 {And this is where white made his mistake. He forgot about my bishop on g6 and after I pointed my finger to my bishop, he resigned.} Bxc2 {However I wonder what would have happened after Ra1, then my a7 pawn would be attacked and white may still have a bit of a game. But he would have lost his bishop after Ra1 Bb2 Rxa7 exd4.}
