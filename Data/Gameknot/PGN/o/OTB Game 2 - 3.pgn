[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 {I started off with my usual.} e6 {And, he responded with the French Defense.} 2. d4 {Of course, I knew how to handle myself here since I was taken off guard the very first time that this was played against me.  That was, during my misstep against blitzkov.} Nf6 {This is a common move, in the aftermath.} 3. Bg5 {I was fixated on developing my B and pinning the N.  But, slightly better was 3.e5.  It's based on what GM Susan Polgar in the French Defense.  That was combined with what I later saw in TA's game with a Q against both R's, in which, it was a draw.  In fact, that was, by far, the longest game that I annotated.  It was over 160 moves.  But, that's how Joe responded.  The idea being is that it kicks the N and gains tempo.  However, it's more then just that.  The most important concept is that black most often responds with 3...Ne4.  That is known to give white a slight advantage because of those solid pawn chains which I also learned from Susan.  I forgot that here.} Be7 {Even though he breaks the pin, it's not too late to play 4.e5 which is what I do.  The only inconvenience is that if Perry plays 4...Ne4, I'll have to lose a tempo to avoid exchanging B's.  As I don't think that there's no good reason to exchange.  That is because my DSB is at least as powerful as his DSB.  The idea being is that my Bg5 covers 7 squares, and if Perry moves his N, his Be7 will cover 7 squares.  But, for the time being, it only covers 5 squares since his N is blocking two of those squares. } 4. e5 d5 {?? However, Perry made a terrible mistake here.  In fact, I call it a blunder.  I'm not sure why he played this.  Perhaps, he was focused on stopping my e pawn from advancing.  What he doesn't realize, is that I can advance and exchange it with 4...exd6 e.p.  But, I was not going to capture en-pessant because I have something better.  At the very least, I can win a piece for a pawn with my next move.} 5. exf6 Bd6 {?? Trying to get the B out of harm's way.  But, this is a bigger blunder, as now, it is more then just a free piece.  First, I'll get another pawn, but that's not all.  Instead, this is where I apply what happened with Charles against Janet and Susan Polgar against Vladimir.  As I am about to threaten a promotion and in the same manner.  Even if Perry prevents my pawn from promoting, I would win his Queen on d8 since it's pinned.  Best was 5...gxf6, after which I'd retreat my B.} 6. fxg7 Qxg5 {But, Perry thought that he had protected his Queen and almost equalized except for the pawn. His instincts is protecting the Q, but he has no idea what I am about to do.  What many people don't know is that I study these games where they exchanged R and Queened with a Q remaining on the board, and that's what I am about to do here.  After 7.gxh8, with both Rooks on the board, I had to borrow a white Queen from another chess board.  Otherwise, it would've been hard to establish that I had a Q since I couldn't turn a R upside down, which is generally what's done when you promote with a Q still on.} 7. gxh8=Q+ Kd7 {Even if I were up against a weaker opponent, I'd resign as black, at this point.  As black is too far behind to stand a chance.  But, that's not how Perry thinks.} 8. Bb5+ {So, I try to put some pressure by placing him in check.  Better would've been to grab the h pawn with 8.Qxh7.} c6 9. Bd3 f5 {However, that opportunity wasn't gone.  Of course, Perry played this to prevent me from taking his h7 pawn.  He thought that it was protected this way, but didn't realize that I attacked it twice with my last move.  But, this is where I grabbed it, at once, especially since it places him in check.} 10. Qxh7+ Be7 {If we weren't in a position like this and things were even, I would've gotten out of check with the K.  As now, Perry has left his B pinned.  And, I'm gonna keep it that way since I have a potential threat which will later become reality.  In fact, that is one of two ways that I'm going to win this game.} 11. Qf3 {Meanwhile, I get my Queen ready for action.} c5 {I think that Perry's goal is to distract me so much that I don't think about my Bd3.  As a likely motive is 12...c4, so that not only would I have to defend it.  But, in doing so, there would be less squares for that B to cover.  Well, I'm determined not to allow that since I will capture it with my next move.} 12. dxc5 Qc1+ {Similar to what I noted earlier, if things were even, I would've recaptured with the Be7.  Instead, Perry tries to get sneaky with his Queen.  This is Hope Chess and, pretty much, all you can do in a lost position.  I almost fell into the trap.  With that being said, Perry is hoping that I will play 13.Ke2? with the idea being that afterwards he would get back a pawn and R with 13...Qxb2.  Well, that was not going happen, as I threaten to liquidate by interposing with my Q.} 13. Qd1 Qxb2 {I figured that Perry would play this anyway, but the big difference is that it's not going to win my R due to my last move.  And, I will defend in a similar by moving my N to d2.  I'm not crazy about 14.Nd2, but for the obvious reason, 14.Nc3?? is unplayable.} 14. Nd2 Qe5+ {This move took me a little off guard, and I was wondering what to do.  It's partly because, I am about to lose my right to castle.  With that being said, I almost played 15.Qe2?? with the idea of liquidating.  But, since I would be in check, Perry would win the R back on a1 which I also wasn't going to allow.  I had also considered 15.Ne2 or 15.Be2, but self pinning my N or B would take away the mobility of my Qd1.  Therefore, I ruled those candidate moves out of court, and decided that this was the best one.  The reason being is that I have plans to threaten checkmate with a later Qdh5 which is soon to occur.  With that being said the other moves would've been more obvious, but this is where I remembered that "When you see a good move, look for something better."} 15. Kf1 Qc7 {Putting pressure on my c5 pawn.  But, Perry could've won it with 15...Qxc5, though, it would not matter because of what I have.} 16. Bb5+ {In fact, I place Perry in check knowing that 16...c6 is not an option this time since that pawn has been removed.} Nc6 {I would've gotten out of check with 16...Kd8.  The reason being is that this move pins Perry Knight.  After being far behind, it's enough that his B pinned, but now I've got 2 pins which will also prove to be overwhelming.  And, I also remembered that to win this game because of what's soon to occur.} 17. Qdh5 {And, this is where I follow through on my plan to bring one of my Q's to h5.  The idea behind this is that with both pieces pinned, I intend to bring this Q to f7, where mate will be unavoidable.  The interesting thing is that I saw all of this coming and first analyzed it with 13...Qxb2  However, I could not follow through on any of it until now.} Qe5 {Of course, Perry is trying to stop it with this move as it is the second example of Hope Chess.  Ironically, I almost fell into the trap (which is what he was hoping for) with 18.Q5f7?? right away.  As I was, at first, thinking that if 18...Qxa1! I'd mate at once with 19.Qxe7#.  But, after a second look combined with a little analysis, I realized that this plan would not work because taking on a1 would also place me in check.  That's an example of an intermediate check which is known to give the opponent counterplay.  This is what he was hoping for but was not going to get as I have become too familiar with Hope Chess to fall into the trap.  One reason is because of what GM Susan Polgar emphasized which is, "You must always ask yourself what does my opponent want." } 18. Re1 {So, I waited until the time was right and kicked his Queen immediately.  The idea being is that this will allow me to play Q5f7.  The only thing that would temporarily block this is 18...Qg7, but after I take the Q, it would be possible.  Therefore, checkmate is unavoidable, at this point.} Qf4 {But, Perry played this.  He was trying to display another episode of Hope Chess.  But, I call this reverse psychology since his hope was a trap.  As noted earlier, I am going to bring my Q from h5-f7 where I will mate.  The only thing that almost held me back was forgetting that his Nc6 was also pinned.  At first, I thought that after 19.Q5f7 Qxd2 20.Qxe7 would be a blunder since he could win back a Q with 20...Nc6  But, after seeing where it is and that it's pinned, I then realized that this is mate.  So, I went for it with my next move, and not surprisingly Perry took on d2.  But, black fell into my trap as Perry thought that he had gotten counterplay by winning a piece back.  And, that is when I checkmated him, at once.} 19. Qh5f7 Qxd2 20. Qfxe7# {}
