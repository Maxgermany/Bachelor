1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 Na5 10. Bc2 c5 11. d4 Qc7 12. Nbd2 Nc6 13. d5 {For a long time before this game was played, 13 dxe5 was popular, but in the end it failed to satisfy White's aspirations.  Blocking the centre had been considered inadequate, but the time had come to explore it more deeply.  Karpov, with his fine sense for space, was the proper man to tackle it.} Nd8 {As we saw, at a5 the knight has no future (Marovic is referring to Geller-Mecking, Palma de Mallorca 1970, a game I referred to in my post "to develop a bishop"  http://gameknot.com/room-fm.pl?home=2&th=775 ) and so Black turned to an old alternative.  Foreseeing White's kingside play, Black moves his forces to the same side;  the knight retreats to d8 whence it can reach f7 and take part in the defense of the kingside.} 14. a4 {The purpose of this undermining move is not only to win the open file, but first and foremost to neutralize any activity on the queenside, creating the right preconditions for kingside play.} Rb8 15. axb5 {White could postpone the exchange by 15 b4, but he correctly assessed that he could seize the open file before Black could disentangle his back rank and oppose the a1-rook.  Besides, he probably wished to exclude ...a5 at some point.} axb5 16. b4 Nb7 {If Black resolves the tension by 16...c4, then White's strategic goal is achieved and he can concentrate on his kingside activity.  Karpov-Spassky, USSR Ch, Moscow 1973 then continued 17 Nf1 Ne8 18 N3h2 f6 19 f4 Nf7 20 Nf3 g6 21 f5 with enduring pressure.  Unzicker's decision not to block the queenside is principled, but on b7 the knight has no porspects and Black's difficulties continue.} 17. Nf1 Bd7 18. Be3 Rba8 19. Qd2 Rfc8 20. Bd3 g6 21. Ng3 {This time the f5-square is out of the knight's reach, but it is useful to prevent 21...Nh5 and keep in check ...f5.} Bf8 {21 ... Ne8 looks to me more natural} 22. Ra2 {The command of the open file is essential in this closed position.  With this in mind 22 Qb2 followed by 23 Ra3 was more precise.} c4 {?!  Black should play 22...Rxa2  23 Qxa2 xcb4 24 cxb4 Qc3 25 Qb1 Qa3 with better chances than in the game, although the b5-pawn remains lastingly vulnerable and the b7-knight passive.} 23. Bb1 {After 23 Bf1 White could not control his opponent's counterplay based on ...f5.} Qd8 {In case of 23...Rxa2  24 Qxa2 Qd8 25 Qa6 White keeps control of the open file.  The text-move prepares to snatch it and Black must have felt confident.} 24. Ba7 {!  Deep and beautiful! By temporarily closing the file, White makes sure he can open it at will after regrouping his pieces and so keep control of it.} Ne8 {Black cannot get rid of the blockader at a7 by 24...Qc7, since 25 Ra6 enables White to fortify it by 26 Qa2.} 25. Bc2 Nc7 {?! Black assessed 25...Ng7  26 Rea1 f5 as risky due to 27 exf5 gxf5 28 Ng5 which is true, but does passive waiting improve his chances?} 26. Rea1 Qe7 27. Bb1 Be8 28. Ne2 Nd8 29. Nh2 {Now we see that controlling the open a-file was not White's only aim.  He now opens a second front: by playing f4 he will transfer the weight of the action to the kingside.} Bg7 30. f4 f6 {This is consistent with the passive defence to which Black has resorted, and was probably prompted by the fact that 30...exf4 cedes the central d4-square to the white knights.} 31. f5 g5 {Black will not be able to maintain the blockade of the kingside and further waiting was a better policy.} 32. Bc2 Bf7 33. Ng3 Nb7 {?!  33...h5 seems indispensable.} 34. Bd1 h6 {34...Qe8 is somewhat better, but after 35 Bf3 h5 36 Qd1 White will eventually break through anyway either via h5 or down the open file.  No defense is visible.} 35. Bh5 Qe8 36. Qd1 Nd8 37. Ra2a3 Kf8 38. Ra1a2 Kg8 39. Ng4 Kf8 40. Ne3 Kg8 41. Bxf7+ Nxf7 42. Qh5 Nd8 43. Qg6 Kf8 44. Nh5 {In all these games we have seen Black building the defensive formation c5-d6-e5, which by its position on the board and the nature of its structure directs the activity of both players towards the wings.  Game after game we saw the same crystal-clear method of play, based on two actions:  the first, designed to balk or neutralize Black's counterplay on one wing and the second, launching an attack on the king at a moment when the other sectors of the board have been stabilized.  In the process we learnt that the central defensive wall is not as durable as it looks.  It is immobile and rarely enables Black to create effective counterplay, and it did not protect him against wing attacks.  Even worse, the pawn-wall itself sometimes became the target of the undermining moves b4 and f4. }
