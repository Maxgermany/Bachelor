1. e4 {OTB:  Floyd decides he wants another game, so I annotate it as well.  I choose e4!  } Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. e5 {This was probably not my best option.} Ne4 4. Nxe4 dxe4 5. d4 exd3 e.p. 6. cxd3 {I'm already struggling because of my stupid attack on his N, dumb dumb dumb.  Oh well. } Nc6 7. Nf3 Bg4 8. Bf4 {I have lost the tempo having to guard my dang pawn.} e6 9. Be2 Bb4+ 10. Nd2 Bxe2 11. Qxe2 Nd4 12. Qd1 {At some point here I'm hoping for a sneaky Q-a4 for + and grabbing one of his minor pieces.} Qh4 13. Bg3 Qg5 14. f4 Qe7 {I "think" I did that the best I could, at least rid the queen for a minute.} 15. O-O Bxd2 16. Qxd2 h5 17. Qd1 {I got angry with myself after I made this bone headed move, it was a total waste of a move and I think I lost because of it.  Hindsight shows me that h4 was better, even if it blocks my Bishop. } h4 18. Bf2 Nf5 19. Rc1 f6 20. d4 c6 21. d5 {I notice salvation, perhaps he'll leave his queen in front of his king just a bit longer.} exd5 22. exf6 {DON'T TAKE WITH THE QUEEN AND I WIN!  LOL} Qxf6 {Dang.  Plan foiled.} 23. Bc5 O-O-O 24. Bxa7 h3 25. Re1 hxg2 26. Bc5 Rxh2 {I should have went ahead and went b-e7 forking the Q and R.  Nah, truth be told I'm in a world of hurt no matter what I do...oh well. } 27. Qg4 {But no instead I do this move....*stupid smack} Rdh8 28. Be7 {Another bone head move by me...I really must slow down when playing OTB.} Qd4+ {That bishop was covering my kings flank...and by my order he moved and I lose.} 29. Re3 Qxe3# {Lost this one.  I do believe letting his pawn infiltrate my position was a bad idea.  }
