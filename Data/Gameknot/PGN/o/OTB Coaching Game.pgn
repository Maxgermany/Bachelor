[White "Joe (1305)"]
[Black "Mariann "]
[Opening "Petrov (C42), Damiano variation"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual.} e5 {As does she.} 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Instead of playing 2...Nc6 with which I play the Ruy Lopez, Mariann tried something and played the Petrov Defense.} 3. Nxe5 {Of course, this is the most common response, as well as, Mariann's next move.} Nxe4 4. Qf3 {But, I really wanted to see what Mariann would do.  As now, not only am I threatening mate, but a piece is being threatened.  It will not be easy to deal with it.  And, if she misses one of them, that's when I'll coach.  I thought she would.  However, my anticipation was that she'd see the mate but blunder a piece.} d5 {?? However, she overlooked the main threat which will give me the mate.  So, I told Mariann that this a blunder.  } 5. Qxf7# {Given that we were on the wrong side of the board, I looked at it the wrong way and, inadvertently, gave her the wrong information.  I said that better was just to move the pawn one square which prevents mate.  She said, "I didn't know what to do."  I then said that this protects the piece but advancing it just one square did that as my N is threatened.  Getting confused of where we were set up, I was implying, if you look at it from the right square like this diagram, as opposed to, the game that best would've been 4...d6.  It was then that I asked myself what I did.  Looking at it the right way, this does the same thing.  But, luckily this was such a short game and I know the defense that I will go back when it's her and me and edit that comment.  As best was 4...f6  That's the move that would've prevented mate and protected the N.  I was then looking at what comes after like 5.Qh5+, but don't like the looks of 5...g6 since there's an intereference with my N.  In other words, it prevents my Q from forking on e5 which is what you see in the Domino's Defense.  But, after this game, we played another one, and I coached you.  Unfortunately, the circumstances were the same with the board being on the wrong.  Moreover, is that it was longer, so I felt that it could not be annotated.  But, she played the Domiano's Defense and accepted the piece sac on e5 which got her in trouble.  Then, Mariann, overlooked the pinning motif with her Q against the K which enabled me to win.  She then overlooked something that lost the other R.  Being that we were out of time combined with ruinous loss of material, she resigned.  So, I combined this game with the second game to tell what's important to learn from this game.  And, it was exactly what GM Susan Polgar emphasized at Polgar University 2017.  I told her that it is important to be aware of all threats by asking yourself what your opponent wants to do.  For example, does he or she want to mate or win material.  If any of that is a yes, you need to respond to the threat.  That is an important step to becoming a better chess player. }
