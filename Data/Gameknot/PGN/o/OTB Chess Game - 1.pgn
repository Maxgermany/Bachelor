[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Scandinavian variation"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual opening.} Nf6 {As usual, I don't know what to expect from Carl since he changes his openings and defenses, periodically.  I'm not sure what you call it, but it's a reversed Reti opening since that starts off with 1.Nf3.} 2. Nc3 {Because I'm also reversing to defend and know that after 1.Nf3 black's best response is 1...Nc6  So, things are happening that way but in reverse since black played 1...Nf6, first.  But, upon studying Eric's recent annotation, based on what ION mentioned and in a similar position, slightly better might have been 2.e5 which also protects.  Thing is that I once did something like that but in a different opening and was corrected.  As I was told that playing e5 right away was just pushing pawns instead of developing, and he recommended that I did no do that.} g6 {Being that Carl can't use his d pawn to get his B out; unless we go into exchange variation, or he lets me attack his Nf6 in a bad way starting with 2...d6?!, he wisely, fianchettos.  I was expecting that and have my next move ready.} 3. d4 {And, that's right here.  To remember what to do when black plays the French or Philidor's Defenses; the pneumonic device that I was given is that when black pushes their pawn only 1 square, white's best response is with d4.  Not only do I follow that here, but I've recited that to my student, goldmedal10.} d5 {I'm familiar with this pattern as the exchange variation, I guess you call (since Carl's threatening to exchange) favors black.  What he really wants is to remove my Nc3.  } 4. e5 {That's not going to happen here.  Instead, I attack his Nf6.  As noted with Eric, these are the variations that I studied with the French Defense, but they work with other variations, including here.  The idea isn't just a gain of tempo, but I've now got a solid pawn chain which is very useful here.  Having said that, what Carl does next is a conditional move.  I was prepared for it, as I'm now about to get a favorable exchange since black is about to wind up with isolated pawns.} Ne4 5. Nxe4 dxe4 6. Bc4 {And, I continue with my development.} Bf5 {Carl develops to.  I didn't see the point to this move, until now.  But, what black really wants to exchange on d4 starting with something like 7...Nc6  And, when all is said and done, an eventual ...Bxc2, winning a pawn.  That wasn't immediate but a very long term sequence which I'm sure that Carl has planned because we think alike.} 7. g4 {Not seeing the point to his move, at the time, but liking it now to prevent later trouble, I decide to go on the offense.  I do this with the attack.} Be6 {?! Better was 7...Bd7.  Although that crams the Q, for the moment it's better then undeveloping or what I'm about to do, as noted below.} 8. Bxe6 {I had choices on what to do with my B.  I usually retreat because I, generally, don't see a good reason for exchanging early.  But, this is an exception.  I did this and for more then just tripling Carl's pawns around the K side.  The main reason is that, in the process, his f pawn is now gone.  This is significant because of the fact that the f pawn is the weakest pawn on the chess board.  As a matter of fact, in the Domiano's Defense, 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6? white's best move 3.Nxe5! because of what happens when black takes back.  Ok, so that's obvious, but similar to a student, back in the day, I answered with 3.Nc3.  It's not obvious how I remembered that capturing on e5 is obvious.  But, the real way that I remembered, once and for all, was TA's blitz Q sacs.  So, let's say Joe was white, he started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5? (which is ill advised for anyonelse) 2...Nf6 (but even if black played 2...Nc6), Joe's next move is the same, contrary to how most would respond, 3.Qxf7+ which is where he sacs the Q for pawn.  And, the reason for him winning is significant.  It's not like most blitz, but he mentioned that way early when there's plenty of time, his opponents go wrong very soon afterwards by not paying attention to the fact that they're K is weakened without the f pawn.  So, they do things like stop developing because they feel they've won and lose.  It doesn't seem relevant to this game, but keeping all of these perspectives in mind, I more or less, convert the equation by exchanging to remove Carl's critical pawn from the chess board.  As now, he needs to be weary about his monarch for the rest of the game.  Thus, it's no longer safe for carl to castle short. } fxe6 9. Be3 {Having said that, I continue with my development.} Bg7 {Completing his fianchetto.} 10. Ne2 {And, I complete my development, once and for all.} Nc6 {As does Carl.} 11. Nf4 {Bringing my N to a better spot, whilst, threatening e6 which he's about to protect.  He picks the right away because using the K would leave it exposed.  Once he protected, I decide to castle once and for all which will allow Carl to do the same.  } Qd7 12. O-O O-O-O {In fact, he does it on opposite wings which is the right choice.  Ironically, I notated Carl as castling K side which is what almost corrupted the position for annotation.  As noted, castling short wouldn't have worked out for him since the f pawn was removed.  But, with this move, however, his K is well protected, again.  } 13. g5 {I played this to allow my Q more mobility, as it now covers two more squares.  But, the bigger reason for this candidate move was to prevent Carl from pinning my Nf4.  It might not look so bad, but after 14.Bh6, this move is unplayable.  And, that's another example of where timing's everything.  As, I don't want my pieces tied down.} b6 {This time, I don't see the point to this move.  Since we're not in the endgame, this seems to weaken his K, unnecessarily.  If he had been safely able to castle short and advanced the pawn one square, I'd see the point.  But, there was no need to open up a window since I wasn't threatening mate.} 14. c4 {Meanwhile, I open up another diagonal for my Q.  I'd like to have, as many options as, possible, before I bring the last piece into play; and thus, allow the R's to see each other, which is how it's supposed to be done.} Nb4 {Carl's trying to stop it.  In fact, this move prevents what I was about to play which would've been 15.Qc2.} 15. Qd2 {But, "there's always another way of doing something", as chesskingdom64 points out.  So, I go on the offense, instead.} c5 {I anticipated a N retreat but am not surprised to see Carl protect this way.} 16. a3 {So, I attack again to force Carl back.  The whole idea behind it, although not applicable with this position; is that Jack told me to be careful with the N's.  That's is don't let it go too far, as once it reaches passed a certain rank, they can become dangerous.  But, that wasn't going to happen here, so I was a little paranoid there.} Nc6 17. d5 {? But, my e pawn still remain attacked.  Better was to exchange, though, with 17.dxc5  However, I was dealing with an intereference since my pawn was blocking a diagonal for my Be3, and therefore, restricting a square that it could cover.  The idea is to have your B cover, as many squares as, possible.  One was blocked and would've remained that way, had I exchanged.  But, I could've lost a pawn, after 17...exd5  Carl's next move, however, is going to allow me to win the equivalent of a pawn with a series of exchanges.} Nxe5 18. Nxe6 Qxe6 19. dxe6 Rxd2 20. Bxd2 Nxc4 {I know why Carl did it, though, since b2 and d2 are forked.  But, it's ineffective since I have an answer to it with my next move which protects both.} 21. Bc3 Bd4 {?? Best was 21...Bxd4.  But, it's obvious that Carl didn't want it.  The real reason is because he's a pawn down and doesn't want to liquidate.  But, I believe that another reason is that he was focused on my K and had plans to attack it with his B+N+R.  Whether he likes it or not, I decide to put a stop to that, by liquidating, anyhow.  Doing that is also going to win a piece, in addition to, what I already have which is now clearly winning for white.} 22. Bxd4 cxd4 23. Rac1 {Of course, I only had 23.Rc1 and was thinking about which R.  I did something like this with Eric when mentioning about Rfe1, I believe it was.  He rightly pointed out that the R's didn't see each, so there was only R which made it Re1.  Well, the opposite is true here since either one could move.  So, I figured out based on how I think.  And, I determined that it was this R because it allows me to centralize the other R, bring it to the center, at a later time.  If I had used the other R, I wouldn't have been able to centralize either one. } b5 {Trying to protect, Carl plays this.} 24. b3 {But, it's too late since the N is attacked twice and only and can't be defended a second time.  Black, however, can do something else which would give him counterplay.} Kb7 {But, it's not with this move.  I do know why he played it since it's now an endgame, and the K is generally useful then, but not was not the time.  Better was for Carl to advance his passed pawn with 24...d3.  If he did this, I'd hold off and play 24.Rfd1 and if 24...d2 (as a conditional move), I'd play 25.Rc2, to stop it cold in it's tracks.  This move, however, allows me to take right away.} 25. bxc4 a6 {Preventing me from winning another pawn.  But, I've got no intention of taking because of what I explain below.} 26. c5 {I also considered 26.cxb5.  In fact, I almost played it but decided against it, as after taking back, I don't have a passed pawn and wouldn't know what to do.  But, this move, however, gives me a passed pawn, with which, I start pushing.  As they say, passed pawns must be pushed.  The reason being is that pushing a passed pawn is what makes it dangerous.} Kc6 {Preventing my pawn from advancing, for now.} 27. Rfe1 {So, I target a different pawn by attempting to put a stop to his passed pawn.  Of course, I'm hoping for 27...e3?} Kd5 {But, Carl finds the best move by protecting this way.} 28. c6 {So, I continue pushing and with the hope that he blunders with 28...Kxe6?? Not surprisingly, he doesn't, but the c pawn has been my main focus for the last 2 or 3 moves.} Rc8 {Like before, Carl finds the best move and prevents a promotion.} 29. c7 {But, that doesn't stop me from advancing the pawn, just one square further.  I'm still trying to make things difficult for Carl which appears to be working for now.  } a5 {But, that's not here as Carl's hoping for a blunder which would allow him to promote.  He starts with this move, and I already know where he's getting to.} 30. Kg2 {So, I ignore it, for now, and start getting my K involved since this an endgame.} b4 {But, once Carl plays this, I take immediate action.} 31. axb4 axb4 32. f3 {?? This is where I go wrong against Carl.  My focus was on advancing that pawn and connecting with g5, as the idea was 33.f4, and then using the K.  My focus was on promoting a pawn.  I also thought that if worse came to worse, we'd exchange on f3, which would allow me to stop his pawn on f4 with one of my R's.  But, this is a terrible blunder which should lose a winning game.  As Carl won't exchange, but instead, he'll advance.  And, doing that will leave him unstoppable passed pawn.  I have seen something like this a couple of times prior, but was unprepared for this moment.  So, knowing that I am lost here, if black finds the best move, rather then resign, there's small hope of getting a draw which is about to happen.  But, I visualize the variations several moves down the road, until I can force the draw.} e3 {But, that doesn't start right here.  I was thinking about what to do here since the concern becomes 33...d3, and even after moving a R to prevent a fork, 34...d2 with, at least an unstoppable pawn.  What I didn't realize, until now, is that Carl has a backwards pawn which helps me a little bit.  But, 32...d3?? doesn't, but it loses immediately after 33.fxe4+.  So, this was still his best move, but I've got more fight left then it appears.  And, I knew that, so then, it's about what to do.  And, believe it or not, this is where I start thinking about what's going to happen in the end.  My thinking is that if I can organize both of my R's against his K, I'll be able to get a draw by repetition which is, exactly, how it's going to end.} 33. Re2 {So, I let him take on e6 by starting with this move.  Afterall, 33...Kxe6 is a conditional move, afterall.} Kxe6 34. Rb2 {And, that's because I go right after his b4 pawn.  Down the road, it's because of what will happen, after I take.} Kd6 {Getting his K into action.  The idea being is to get it d5 and trying to support his connected pawns with them.  But, it's too late for Carl to bring his K into action since I'll take on b4, first.} 35. Rxb4 e5 {So, if Carl can't use his K, he'll use his pawns.  } 36. Rb6+ {But, I put a stop to that.} Kd7 {Carl knew that 36...Kd5?? would lose immediately to 37.Rb8!  So, at the same time as, trying to promote, he's concentrating on my passed pawn.  This is good because he's not underestimating me which is what I had done against anitam.  And, it's also what a different student did with Jack and lost. } 37. Rcc6 {But, I am now prepared for his next move.  In fact, this was the idea behind 34.Re2 and 35.Rxb4  I was confident that I had thrown away a win; but Jack told me that if that were to happen, and I couldn't win, I should go for, at least, a draw which is what happened here.} e2 {?? Carl's focus was on promoting the pawn.  Best was 37...Rxc7 which would've won for black, as after 38.Rxc7 Kxc7 39...e2 would've done what black is trying to do, and I would've resigned then.  But, in an act of Hope Chess, I was waiting for Carl to become impatient here.  As I now have a forced draw which was the moment I was waiting for, after the blunder that I made on my 32nd move.  } 38. Rcd6+ Kxc7 39. Rbc6+ Kb7 40. Rcb6+ Kc7 41. Rbc6+ Kb7 42. Rcb6+ Ka7 43. Rba6+ Kb7 {At this point, I declared a draw by repetition by announcing it.  It's an intermezzo which means that white is winning, and yet, it's drawn, as I learned that term from ION.  Before, the position hadn't exactly repeated 3 times since he went Kc7 and then, Ka7.  But, right when this was played ...Kb7 was reached, as well as, my moves, 3 times in a row.  So, I knew that the same position occurred that many times and a draw was forced.  I used the exact same strategy as one of Jack's young students, Cavayah against me.  I had a won position and was a piece up and threatened to do damage, but I overlooked something which allowed her to get a draw by repetition.  I thought that the position repeated twice, but Cavayah was right.  I miscalculated one move which made it 3 times, when she declared it.  Believe it or not, Cavayah is exactly the same age that I was when I first got back into playing chess, after having had given it up for a while.  At 16, I was going to learn once and for all, as a result of failing English.   And, Cavayah is a pretty strong player who sometimes beats Carl and Tom Walsh.  Jack Stockel, as we know is such a good mentor that not only do I enjoy teaching chess, but 2 of his younger students have their parents drive them 30 minutes from where they live to the chess club for more lessons with the, legendary, mentor.  Cavayah is the main one, as it happened with a 12 year old student, once.  Not seeing how it's a draw, Carl got out of check, but I played the same moves on him, anyway.  Jack analyzed it and agreed that there was no way out of this for black.  Jack congratulated me and said that I played very well for someone that was winning.  I'd like to agree but know that I made a mistake by letting one of his passed pawns become a monster.  And, if Carl had played 37...Rxc7, instead, he would've promoted, and I'd be lost.  }
