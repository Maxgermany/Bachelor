[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange, Alekhine variation"]

1. e4 {As usual, the King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {And, he responds conventionally with the King's Pawn Game.  BTW, it is going to become a Ruy Lopez.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {So, he decides to take attack my LSB, after I take his Knight.  BTW, one week later, last Friday this opponent told me that 4.Bxc6 is best, in this position.} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5 {And, I respond by taking his pawn.  In my past games, 5.Nxe5 has won a free pawn on Gameknot, but not this time.  He illustrated why it doesn't.} Qd4 {Normally, it is too early to bring your Queen out by move 5, but this is an exception.  That is because I have to give him back a pawn.  If I don't, I lose a piece, for his pawn.  And, the rule is, "Exchange pawns, not pieces", as elyhim taught me.} 6. Nf3 {As a result, I pull my Knight back, protecting it and attacking his Queen.} Qxe4+ {But, that does not bother him.  Instead, he places me in check.  I used to view this as serious, and this is a point where I would often resign.  Why?  I lose my chance to castle, as a result.  However, he proved that it does not make this check serious, and I could do something that is, as good as, castling.  What is it?  Well, there is still a way to tuck the monarch away, as we will see momentarily.} 7. Qe2 {In the meantime, this move is forced, and he will take advantage by exchanging our Queens.  } Qxe2+ 8. Kxe2 Bc5 {As a result, he decides to develop his DSB, while my left wing is completely undeveloped.  But, why not 8...Bd6? That would have done the same thing.  This move, however, will cause problems for his DSB, later in the game.  However, this is the first side where I would normally develop.  Therefore, I just want to continue with my development immediately.  He said, however, that it is far more important to get the King to safety since it is exposed, at the moment.  So, how do you compensate for losing your right to castle?  He told me that the first thing you want to do is move the Rook directly behind or one file left of the King, and that is what I am going to do.} 9. Re1 Ne7 {In the meantime, he continues with development by bringing out his Knight.  Right now, he does not have a choice, even though you generally don't want to deploy your Knight on the seventh rank, if you're black, or on the second rank, if you are white.  However, if his Knight went to the third rank, what would happen?  Well, it would result in a very serious check where he would have to pull his Knight back to this spot, or play 10...Be7 which would ultimately lose a piece, if he were to castle.  After this move, he told me that my King should go to f1.  That way, it is, as effective as, castling.  } 10. Kf1 O-O {After I do that, he castles.} 11. d4 {This is why I was wondering why 8...Bc5, as opposed to, 8...Bd6.  In this position, I feel that he is trying to stop me from continuing with development, so I decide to kick his DSB.  If this was not played, I do not think that I would be able to develop my bishop, without fianchettoing it.  However, chess mentor myevilluck told me that it is generally a bad idea to fianchetto your bishop. } Bd6 {I'm sure that he wanted to play 11...Bb6, as opposed to, this move in order to protect c7, in the long term.  On other hand, that is not feasible, in this position.  Why?  If 11...Bb6, 12.Re7 which gives away a free steed.  I did a lot of editing, in terms of setting up the positions, and the original recording was that black played 11...Bb6.  And, I developed before moving the King back, followed by the Rook on e1, as mentioned earlier.  However, like the Master Mater, it is extremely unlikely that Jack will give away material, unless it=a win, or if he is testing you, as we will see later on.  } 12. Be3 {So, as I mentioned earlier, I do not need to fianchetto my DSB, in order to continue with development.} Nd5 {Now, he decides to make his Knight more active by taking it off the seventh rank.  If I were black, however, I would have brought out the LSB, in order to complete development.  } 13. Nc3 {In the meantime, I decide to finish my own development by bringing the other Knight, "into play", as my opponent calls it.  Therefore, I believe that I have an edge, as I am more developed.  However, Jack has ways around the fact that he is not completely developed.  Sooner or later, he will finish the last step of development. } Nb4 {This is one way that he gets around it.  Jack see's an opportunity to attack my c2 pawn.  However, I miscalculate and make an inaccurate safety check because I think that he is actually attacking my b2 pawn.  In all of my past games on Gameknot, b2 was under attack, not c2.  Therefore, I decide to protect b2, which will become my first mistake, as it gives away a free pawn.} 14. Rab1 Nxc2 15. Re2 {After he takes, I decide to attack his Knight.  Therefore, Mr. Stockel will be forced to retreat the Knight before he can complete development.  As noted earlier, he frequently has a way around that. } Nb4 16. a3 {After he pulls back, I decide to reattack his Knight, forcing him to make another retreat.} Nd5 17. Na4 {? After he pulls back, I decide to place my Knight on the rim which is a mistake.  In most cases, a Knight on the rim is grim, and this is not an exception.  My goal, however, was to wear him down so that he would eventually give something away, like one of his pawns, on the a-c file.  However, it is very unusual for players like Jack Stockel to blunder material, as I mentioned earlier.  It's like your chance of getting four of a kind, in a pocker game.  In addition, myelivuk told me in a PM that you always need a good reason for making a move, and that is why he did not want me to, "fianchetto the bishop", until I learned more openings.  It is especially because my reasons behind a fianchetto are not good.  On the other hand, the reason for this move was even worse then that of a fianchetto, and I did not even know it until yesterday (when I started editing this game.)  If that's not bad enough, this move is a big mistake and, almost, a blunder.  Why?  It is going to result in a serious pin, on his next move.  As a result, this is a bad move and for the wrong reason.} Bg4 18. Ree1 {?? This move, however, is even worse.  In fact, it is a blunder, not just a mistake.  In this position, I was determined to break the pin, at once because I absolutely hate being pinned.  Although 18.h3 does not break the pin, it was best, in this position.  First, he is going to force an exchange, as a direct result.  That, itself, is bad enough because I do not like to exchange, when I am behind.  Most importantly, however, is the fact that this move exposes my King.  After the exchange, my King is almost hanging, and there are a lot of weaknesses because I no longer have three surrounding pawns to keep the King protected.  Instead, I only have a case a of doubled pawns, so I now have to be very careful, with the King.  Because of this blunder, he now has a strong edge. } Bxf3 19. gxf3 Rfe8 {In this position, he wants to exchange our Rooks.  However, I think that he is attacking my DSB but make a serious miscalculation.  Until now, I completely forgot that this bishop is actually protected.  } 20. Bg5 {? So, I allow the exchange.  I was worried that he would win a free bishop, if I did not accept it.  Therefore, he actually gets, what he really wanted.  With that in mind, this is another mistake as I am still lacking in material, so this exchange benefits him.  In addition, this move gives away another free pawn, after the exchange.  } Rxe1+ 21. Rxe1 Bxh2 22. Kg2 {? After he takes, I decide to attack his DSB.  According to Jack Stockel, however, this is a mistake, in itself.  Why?  When you have a position like this and your King is already exposed, you don't want to bring him out as this exacerbates the exposure.} Bf4 23. Bxf4 {? Just when I thought that I was compensating for my mistakes, this is another one.  This time, however, I mistakenly thought that his bishop was free.  Once again, however, is the fact that my coach does not give anything away, that often.  Therefore, I overlooked his Knight and did not realize that if I took his DSB, he would retake my DSB, with his Knight.  However, I have not compensated for the loss of material, at the moment.  Better was the immediate 23.Kf1, making up for the fact that I had exacerbated the exposure, as I mentioned earlier.} Nxf4+ 24. Kf1 {After he takes and places me in check, I finally move my King back, as Jack Stockel mentioned a few moves earlier. } Nd3 {So, he decides to attack my Rook.} 25. Rd1 {And, I respond by attacking his Knight.} Nf4 {So, he has no choice but to retreat.} 26. Nc5 {Therefore, I take advantage of my opportunity to bring my Knight back to the proper square, off the rim.} b6 {And, he attacks my Knight, but I do not pull it back to the rim.  Instead, I bring it to e4, which keeps it protected and, hopefully, gives it back it's value.  The thing is that one reason it is usually a bad idea to place your Knight on the rim is that it makes it worth less.  Once it loses some of its value, I do not know if it can be regained.} 27. Ne4 c5 {In this position, Jack's goal is to get rid of his doubled pawns.  Why?  He considers doubled pawns weak, so he gives away a pawn to straighten out his structure.  Last week, his c pawns were also doubled.  Believe it or not, that involved the same opening, (the Ruy Lopez.)  In addition, this move still leaves him a point ahead.  Therefore, giving away a free pawn is not so bad, in this context.} 28. dxc5 bxc5 29. Nxc5 Re8 {In this position, his main goal is to put pressure on my Knight, but I am not going to allow that, as we will see shortly.} 30. b4 {Although I could have, I do not take his a6 pawn.  Why?  If I did that, he would continue to attack my Knight, until the remaining Rooks are off the board.  However, that is something I do not want because I need at least one more powerful piece, in order to stay in this game any longer.  One Knight, as well as, a few extra pawns is not going to cut the mustard, as we will see later on.  Therefore, I decide to connect my pawns.  Note: In a previous game, Mr. Stockel told me and illustrated that two connected pawns are extremely dangerous and often win.} Re6 {?? This is not just a serious mistake, so what happened?  Jack Stockel deliberately made this flaw because he wanted to see if I was going to spot it, so he was testing me.  In one respect, it is similar to elyhim's style of, "Money in the Bank", where he and his student start off with 5 dollars.  Now, if elyhim's student makes a mistake, he or she loses a dollar, of what they started.  If, however, the student makes a good move, he or she gets to keep a dollar.  Now, if the student loses more then 2 or 3$ in the beginning, then you know that he or she did not play well.  Well, the same thing could be said here, but in a very different sense.  That is because Mr. Stockel will unpurposely make a mistake, in some games.  In most cases, his students do not see this mistake.  When that happens, Jack tells the student how he or she could have strengthened his or her position, gotten an advantage, or won material to help them improve their games.  However, as we will see, I exchange his Rook, for my remaining Knight.  Therefore, I spot the mistake, and he told me that even some of his stronger students overlook this.  As a result, Jack told me that he was and looked really impressed that I passed this test.} 31. Nxe6 fxe6 32. Rd8+ {After that, I decide to place him in check, and this is serious.  Why?  He was threatening to promote one of his pawns, but I did not want to allow that.  This should prevent a promotion, but it's not as I am going to make a very serious blunder that will end this game, in a little while.} Kf7 {Forced.} 33. Rh8 {In this position, I am determined to win his h pawn.  Best, however, would have been Rc8, as it puts a lot of pressure on the c file.} h6 {Now, he has a way to protect the pawn.  Of course, I did not realize that and, once again, overestimate the value of this position.  That is going to seal my fate and eventually lead to my downfall.  } 34. Rh7 {?? Jack Stockel accurately pointed out that this is the losing blunder.  When the game was over, he asked me why 34.Rh7, after 31.Nxf6, fxe6 32.Rd8+.  I told him that I was trying to win his h pawn, and I thought that he had no way of protecting it.  Afterall, I have studied some end games with a youtube video.  But, I have also analyzed endgames with the same opponent, before this game. That is how people usually win material during the endgame, specifically pawns.  In fact, that is how I won most of my games, on this site, during the end.  However, that is not the case here, and his response was, "Start thinking".  He told me that the Rook had to stay on the 8th rank, where it remained very active.  This move, however, takes away it's activity, so it goes from being active to inactive (or from mobile to dead.) } h5 {This move might seem like a mistake.  However, his pawn is still protected, in this position, due to his Knight.} 35. a4 {At this point, I am pretty sure that he will make a promotion, but I don't resign immediately.  That is because in previous games, Jack Stockel has said, "Don't give up right away."} c6 {In the meantime, my opponent decides to advance his c pawn.  Why?  Because this is where he starts making plans for a promotion. } 36. b5 {Therefore, with nothing else to lose, I decide to fork his a and c pawns and force an exchange.  If I did not move here, 36...a5, so he could still promote a pawn.  Therefore, I would not stand a chance to make a promotion.  Why?  Because 37...Nd5, and if 38.a7, 38...Nc7, stopping the promotion, in it's path.  Yet, he would still be able to play ...c5, followed by c4.  From there on, it would just keep moving down the ranks, until he promotes.  With this exchange, everything is even material wise, but the game is still lost.  It's a perfect example, that being behind or ahead, material wise, does not retroactively determine a win or loss.  As cdeburca has repeatedly mentioned in some of my previous annotations being even does not=a draw.  Likewise, lacking in material does not necessarily=a loss.  After he and I are done exchanging material, I know that a promotion is inevitable, so I resign.} axb5 37. axb5 cxb5 {After this game, Jack Stockel taught me an important lesson, and his lesson is also the moral of this story.  If an endgame boils down to a Knight V. a Rook, it is extremely important to keep your Rook active.  If you deactivate it, your opponents Knight becomes extremely powerful and dangerous, ultimately leading to a loss. }
