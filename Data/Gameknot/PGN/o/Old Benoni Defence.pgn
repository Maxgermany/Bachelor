[Opening "Old Benoni defence (A43)"]

1. d4 c5 {What is this?? It's the Old Benoni Defence, though I didn't know that at the time.} 2. d5 {Taking the pawn looks suspect, though it seems playable if the number of responses in the database is anything to go by.} Nf6 3. c4 {I've been playing 1.d4 followed by 2.c4 in all games with White recently, and though Black's surprise on his second move made me divert, now I can go back to the game plan.} g6 {Black's going to have a very cramped defence, which is fine by me.} 4. Nc3 Bg7 {I've found out what the opening is by now, and am expecting e6 at some point. But my opponent is "winging it" (and doing it well) so who knows?} 5. Nf3 {I carry on developing...} O-O {Black leaves e6 for the time being.} 6. e4 {Getting a solid central pawn formation already. There's a definite risk to the Benoni, I read, and given the opening is where I usually gain ground against my opponent, I'm confident.} d6 {Releasing the light-squared Bishop, a piece which, apparently, struggles to find its place in this opening. Its options are certainly limited.} 7. h3 {I limit them some more!} e6 {Finally Black contests my spearhead in the centre.} 8. Be2 {I can see where this is going and decide I'll have both Bishops pointing at Black's K-side.} exd5 9. exd5 {I have all those diagonals free! Actually, I find later, taking with the c-pawn is more modern and probably better.} Re8 {Black pins my Bishop.} 10. O-O {But not for long.} Ne4 {I think this is a bit of a premature sortie. But it does open that long diagonal for the Bishop on g7, which is doubtless the idea.} 11. Nxe4 {I'm rather playing into Black's plan, but his Q-side isn't yet developed and I have lots of space.} Rxe4 12. Bd3 Re8 {Black has achieved his aim, and that b-pawn is under a little pressure . But he's still way behind.} 13. Rb1 {I want to get my Bishop out, so decide to cover the b-pawn. It's perhaps a bit of a wasted tempo, since I'll want to move the Rook again at some point, and in fact could probably have played the Bishop out (13.Bg5?) anyway.} Nd7 {I think Black's Knight is heading to f6, to make up for the other's absence.} 14. Bg5 {With the b-pawn safe I can get my final piece out.} Bf6 {I hadn't expected this, and in retrospect I wish I had got rid of this Bishop when I had the chance, leaving Black with a hole on g7. Better still was retreating to f4, attacking the undefended d-pawn.} 15. Qd2 {Instead of these options I go quite wrong. Interestingly, this would probably have been playable had the Black Knight still been on b8. But my caution in covering the b-pawn has given Black the chance to develop it, and he now has the chance to throw my game into disarray!} Ne5 {Nasty, threatening to give me doubled, isolated f-pawns. But I see no way of avoiding them, since after 16.Nxe5 Bxg5 my Queen is threatened. I quite miss 17. f4 Bh6 18. Nf3 Qf6 19. Rbe1 Bd7 20. Ng5 Qd4+ 21. Kh2 Bf5, which is bad enough, but better than what follows...} 16. Bxf6 {Wrong defence.} Nxf3+ 17. gxf3 {Black gets my pawns in the required mess.} Qxf6 18. Kg2 {I'm thinking only to protect my two helpless pawns, but this could have been disastrous.  If 18...Bxh3+ 19.Kxh3 (or I lose the Rook)Qxf3+ 20.Kh2 Re5 I'm in real trouble.} Qh4 {Fortunately, Black misses this possibility too, and I get the chance for some very desperate defending...} 19. Rfh1 Re5 {I'm in a mess, but it's a defendable one. Not as bad as I think.} 20. Rh2 {I'm planning on doubling up my Rooks behind that weak h-pawn, but driving the Rook away with 20.f4 was a better plan.} Bd7 {Allowing the other Rook into the game. Black could have done this with 20...Bf4, forcing an exchange that would have benefitted him, but he's in control now anyway.} 21. Re1 {I'm hoping he'll swap, but of course he won't...} Rg5+ {Instead driving my King into the corner and stopping me doubling the Rooks behind the h-pawn.} 22. Kh1 Qh6 {Curiously missing a chance to line his big guns up against me with 22...Rh5} 23. f4 {Until I force him there! Curious how a move can be correct at one point and quite wrong a move or so later. I'm hoping to trap one of these big guns, but it's not going to happen.} Rh5 24. Qe3 {Adding to the h-pawn's defence. But placing my Queen on the open file is disastrous; after 24.Re8 and the forced exchange of my Rook on e1 I'm probably finished.} Rxh3 {Fortunately, Black goes for exchanging down a little too soon, missing the better chance.} 25. Rxh3 Bxh3 26. Kg1 {I can't afford a discovered check!} Qh4 27. Qg3 {At the very least I can undouble my pawns. However, Black might have been better keeping his Queen on the board.} Qxg3+ 28. fxg3 Kf8 {The King heads out, but it's going nowehere while my Rook controls the only open file. I've rather weathered the storm and am only a pawn down, and a Rook pawn at that. It could have been much worse. Usually this tiny advantage is enough for my opponent, but he's rather underestimated his lead. It's not going to be easy.} 29. Kf2 {I need to get my King towards the centre.} h5 {I was also threatening to win the h-pawn after 30.Rh1.} 30. Bf1 {It's supposedly not best to exchange pieces when a pawn down, but that pawn advantage is the h-pawn, which has a light Queening square, so I try to persuade my opponent to swap Bishops...} Bf5 {He's not having that!} 31. a3 {A rather knee-jerk move, putting my pawn on a dark square to no great advantage I wouldn't think.} a5 {Always more assertive with pawn moves, now my b-pawn can't go to b4 any time soon.} 32. Re3 {Hoping to get my Rook to the b-file...} a4 {Quite missing this obvious reply, which has the added advantage of fixing that b-pawn on its home square.} 33. Bd3 {Another go at exchanging...} Bd7 {Declined!} 34. Bc2 {Planning to advance the b-pawn while I can force the opportunity.} Ra6 {This completely threw me. I was expecting something like 34...Re8, to force a path for the King. I didn't think enough about the implications, and carried on with my plan...} 35. b3 {Now Black can afford to allow an exchange of Bishops and win another pawn into the bargain with 35. b3 axb3 36. Rxb3 Ba4 37. Rc3 Bxc2 38. Rxc2 Rxa3} b6 {Another let-off, since pawns down on either side would have probably spelled the end.} 36. bxa4 Bxa4 37. Bxa4 {Now I have finally got rid of that light-squared Bishop - the one that's supposed to have trouble finding its place in this opening and which has been the source of some irritation.} Rxa4 38. Rb3 Ra6 {Now we're at something of a stand-off, each threatening the other's pawn, while defending our own. But I'm still a pawn down.} 39. a4 {So I go for broke. Clearly it's better to keep this pawn covered and bring my King into the game. But then I just face a long grinding down, so I decide to take my chances...} Rxa4 40. Rxb6 {Getting behind the Black defence.} Rxc4 41. Rxd6 {Creating a passed pawn for myself!} Rd4 42. Ke3 Ke7 {Unfortunately, while Black's Rook is protected by his pawn, mine isn't, and I must give up another pawn...} 43. Rc6 Rxd5 44. Ke4 Rf5 45. Kd3 {I don't want to allow Black's King any headway, but this loses as after 45...h4 gxh4 the pawns are split and probably easier to pick off.} Kd7 {Black needs to get his King forward.} 46. Ra6 {My Rook is the only thing stopping it, so i want to keep it on this rank.} f6 {Now I see Black has gone a little wrong; the Black Rook doesn't have too many options with the pawn on c5 blocking its exit.} 47. Ke4 {I start to hope a tiny bit, realising my opponent isn't infallible at endgames!} Ke7 {He needs to push the c-pawn to allow the Rook out.} 48. Rc6 {I get behind the danger pawn, but perhaps should have played 48.Ra7+, which, according to the analysis, drives the King to his back rank. } c4 {Finally Black has no option but to give up the c-pawn} 49. Kd4 {I pondered and pondered on which was better - taking the pawn with the Rook or going after it with the King and so keeping Black's King from advancing. Of course I chose the wrong option!} Ra5 {Black's Rook is free again!} 50. Rxc4 {The pawn falls! Only now do I see that after 50...Ra3 I can only play 51.Rc3 and after the exchange the Black King mops up.} Kd6 {A definite missed chance for Black.} 51. Rc3 {Now I stop the Black Rook from going to a3.} g5 {He starts to exchange pawns. But with my Rook still on the board I have drawing chances. What's the saying - Rook and pawn endgames are all drawn?} 52. fxg5 fxg5 {Black can force a passed pawn now, but can he Queen it?} 53. Ke4 {I head to the important squares...} Re5+ 54. Kf3 Ke6 55. Kg2 {I must have good drawing chances now unless I blunder?} Kf5 56. Kh3 {There's a risk of going here if the Black Rook gets behind my King.} Rd5 57. Re3 Rd4 {There's a lot of shuffling going on, and I see what Black's plan is - he wants to exchange but be able to recapture with his Rook, so he doesn't have a passed Rook pawn, which is harder to Queen than the g-pawn would be. I can't see any way of stopping this plan.} 58. Ra3 h4 59. gxh4 Rxh4+ 60. Kg3 Re4 {I know there's a draw here if I get it right, for it seems Black is shaping up to block any check with his Rook...} 61. Ra5+ Re5 {He is!} 62. Rxe5+ Kxe5 {Now I know I have a draw, with correct moves.} 63. Kg4 Kf6 64. Kg3 {It's crucial that I go straight back rather than to f3. If I keep doing this the Black pawn can't Queen.} Kf5 65. Kf3 {I need to have this position with Black to move.} g4+ 66. Kg3 Kg5 67. Kg2 Kf4 68. Kf2 Kf5 69. Kg3 Kg5 70. Kg2 Kf4 71. Kf2 g3+ 72. Kg2 Kg4 73. Kg1 {If, for example, I'd played to f1 Black could play 73...Kf3 74.Kg1 g2  and my King must move out of the way to allow the pawn through.} Kf3 74. Kf1 Ke3 75. Kg2 Kf4 76. Kg1 {I need to keep backing away straight.} Kf3 77. Kf1 Ke3 78. Kg2 Kf4 79. Kg1 Kg4 80. Kg2 Kh4 81. Kg1 Kh3 82. Kh1 g2+ {Finally the draw is agreed. After 83.Kg1 Black must give up the pawn or stalemate me anyway.}
