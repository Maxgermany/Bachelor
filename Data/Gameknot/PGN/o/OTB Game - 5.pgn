1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 {Sicillian response to 1.e4} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {When I am White i pause here as is 5.f3 a better response to 4....Nf6} 5. Nc3 a6 {early a6 prevents Bb5 check or otherwise, if White has already moved Bc4 then I believe Black should consider an a6 is not vital} 6. f3 {In this game 6.f3 or 6.Be3 were reasonable options, but as the 6.Be3 Ng4 was a threat, 6.f3 was chosen because the Bb5+ antidote was no longer available. Problem is Black has the option 6...e5 7. Nb3 Qb6 or simply 6....Qb6 Whites response 7.g4 Nc6 8.Nb3 e6 9.Qe2 Qc7 10.Be3 b5 11.0-0-0 Bb7 12 h4 Rc8 this variation follows the lines of a Najdorf defence versus English Attack} e6 7. Be3 Qc7 8. Qd2 Be7 {Both sides continue to develop, perhaps Black needs to take an opportunity to be more adventourous, maybe Qb3, or another pawn move d5?  As Black I never know when the 'right' time to strike is.} 9. g4 b5 {Tentative book lines start to get closer to each other} 10. a3 {How to respond to b5?  I havn't seen a3 much anywhere, obviously after b4, axb4 the a file is open and White has to make a choice about castling on that side. a4 is recommended in some books, or with Q on d2 to ignore it and after Black b4 (if ever) Na4 if necessary.} Bb7 {I suppose there is no harm in a b5 and Bb7 combination for Black.} 11. Rg1 {The book says....., as it happens it reduced some threats in this game.} Nc6 12. g5 {A few options in front of Black now.} Nxd4 {Perhaps Black feels if it's a sharp game reduce some of the advanced pieces to simplify.} 13. Bxd4 {Bishop or Queen takes, but e5 was obvious for Black.} Nh5 {13.Nd7 keeps Black's Knight safe and still looks after the f6 square.  I believe the only reason to be on h5 is goto Nf4 or g3, if these squares were unprotected they would  nice harrassing squares.} 14. h4 e5 15. Be3 Rc8 {15. Rc8 standard move but white is allowed game some time....} 16. Bh3 Rd8 17. Bg4 {...... so why is White making 3 moves to chase a piece on the edge of the board? } g6 {would 17.Nf4 be better?} 18. Bxh5 gxh5 {Who benefits most from this exchange?} 19. O-O-O Rc8 {Both sides try to co-ordinate their pieces} 20. Rg2 Qa5 {20....Qa5 a favourite square of many a Black Queen} 21. Na2 Qa4 22. Nc3 {A miserable attempt at a repetition.} Qc4 {Queen finds a better square to threaten the c-file} 23. Kb1 b4 24. axb4 Qxb4 {After normal exchanges, Black looking a little healthy on the Queenside.} 25. Nd5 {A move White is proud of, if Black refuses the Queen exchange again, then Black is either a piece down (computer engine recommended) or is a pawn down with a centralised exposed King.} Qxd2 26. Rgxd2 Bxd5 27. Rd2xd5 {After some forced exchanges, who do you like?} Rc6 28. f4 {White using the connected pawns and active DSB to keep the pressure on.} exf4 29. Bxf4 Kd7 {White just neatly added his King to the defence of d6. } 30. e5 Rhc8 31. c3 Bf8 {Perhaps this last move was a waiting move} 32. exd6 Rc6c4 33. Rd5d4 Rc4c6 34. Be5 {some to and fro White gained control of some better squares} Rc6c4 35. Rxc4 Rxc4 {It's like always a littel too late, Black is exchanging after refusing the opportunity previously.} 36. Bd4 Rc6 {If 36.Bxd6 Black can lose the Bishop} 37. Kc2 Bxd6 38. Be5 Ke6 39. Rxd6+ {Black moving King away from line of fire but White's pawns look alot better. And wants to force some more exchanges} Rxd6 40. Bxd6 Kxd6 {Black has an active centralised King so how can he defend or capitalise on this position?} 41. b4 {White gaining some ground and removing some squares from Black king.} Kc6 42. c4 {If 41...Kd5 the 42.Kd3} Kb6 {Black king recognising that the two connected pawns (one passed0 are the greatest threat.} 43. Kd3 {If Black only moves King, White will move King and c-pawn to gain ground and remove squares from Black King and push King backwards} a5 {Not Black's greatest moment, but White can still make an error with remaining pawns.} 44. bxa5+ Kxa5 {From now on in, White King should be pushed beyond pawns as it gains more squares than a single pawn. } 45. Kd4 Kb6 46. Kd5 Kc7 47. Kc5 {White should be very happy.  It has taken the Opposition from the Black King, White King is in front of pawn so the White King can move forward and gain squares while the white pawn remains safe (don't push King to far that allows the Black king in behind to capture white pawn).} Kc8 {If 47...Kd7 then 48.Kb6} 48. Kc6 Kd8 49. Kb7 {White king gains controlof Queening square} Ke7 50. c5 Kf8 51. c6 h6 {A few last snatches of hope from Black.} 52. gxh6 f5 {Break for freedom} 53. c7 Kg8 54. c8=Q+ Kh7 {White misses a mate in two.  55.Qf8 f4 56Qg7} 55. Qxf5+ Kxh6 {Black said afterwards he was hoping for a stale mate position.  He has every right to look for one against any opponent.} 56. Qg5+ Kh7 57. Kc7 Kh8 58. Kd7 Kh7 {Here Black Resigned.  I hope you enjoyed the game, I like the simple structure, I think it is very clean.}
