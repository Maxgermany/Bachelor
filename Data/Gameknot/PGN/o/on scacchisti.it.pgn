1. d4 d5 2. c4 {used to be my favorite... i do prefer now c4 and Nf3, or even g3... all with the same side ideas.} Nf6 3. Nc3 c6 4. Bg5 {clear development with the idea that my queen-bishop is not my most important piece and can be exchanged if necessary.} Bf5 5. Nf3 {my main concern when I start to play is to develop. I never see any trap i could make, if ever they exist.} Nbd7 6. e3 {now, i finish my development and plan to hide. But, curiously, here, i will take time to castle.} h6 {as i said my bishop is not necessary to my mind... but...} 7. Bh4 {i decided to force him to discover more. it is a blitz game, isn't it?} e6 {oooh, i like that.} 8. a3 {refusing b4 to King-Bishop} Be7 {not his plan anyway} 9. c5 {gaining space} O-O 10. Bd3 {it was a time when I liked to play only with knights... I change every 6 months...} Bxd3 11. Qxd3 b6 12. b4 {of course not offering him the space to his rook.} bxc5 13. bxc5 Qa5 {finally attacking, but poorly} 14. O-O {turning necessary} Rab8 15. Nd2 {the attack is now on queen side. So, off we go} Rb2 16. Rfb1 Rfb8 17. Rxb2 Rxb2 18. Ndb1 {planning another exchange on a2} Bf8 19. f3 {considering the possibility to change my queen-bishop to go back to queen side} Nh5 20. Nd1 {now i changed my mind once again (often so in blitz) and tells his rook: go away! No other threats...} g5 {but he decides my bishop was more important than his rook...} 21. Nxb2 {so be it} gxh4 {Hm... i prefer my position to his, don't you? But, wait, there is still battle!!!} 22. Qd2 {of course, I claim the exchange} Qb5 {of course, it does not interest him.} 23. Nc3 Qb3 {the queen seems to like danger.} 24. a4 {freeing the rook.} Bg7 {preparing the progression of the pawns...} 25. Rb1 {considering the b-column} Qb8 {finally taking conscious of her gracious person} 26. Nc4 {so, the knight is going to d6 in a -pushing-back-the-queen- operation.} Qc7 27. Nd6 {strategically perfectly placed.} e5 {the progression?} 28. Rb7 {i prefer to continue the harassment} Qd8 29. Ne2 {protecting my pawns-chain} e4 {progression.} 30. Qb2 {maybe a little bit too fast, considering the queen's attack that follows.} exf3 31. gxf3 Qg5+ 32. Kf2 {believe it or not i felt secure, though they are a lot of threats here. but black misses some material...} h3 {seems obvious. but what about the knight on d7? Is there a mate?} 33. Rxd7 {i still felt secure... so i took it I like to test my opponents when they "try" things and hope me to panick} Qg2+ {no panick at all...} 34. Ke1 Qxh2 {h3 is approaching the crucial point.} 35. Qb8+ {occupying the furious diagonal. But will it be sufficient?} Kh7 {leaving the camp} 36. Rxf7 {grabbing, grabbing... but is it clever?} Qh1+ {i wonder if Qg2 was not better.} 37. Kd2 Ng3 38. Qc7 {of course not Nxc7, Qg2. All was so fast! It is western here!} Nh5 {i tried, i go back} 39. Nf5 Qg2 {So strange: black is all on defence!!! except of course h3 pawn.} 40. Nxg7 {free some space and material.} Nxg7 {the queen is now the only attacker with the pawn and I still have a rook to sacrifice if necessary: In case he plays h2, I take the knight and then the pawn.} 41. Kd3 Qg6+ 42. Kd2 h2 43. Ng3 {but now that the queen is on g6, I have better: i can put the knight to protect h1.} h5 {oooops! Last ammo!} 44. Rf5 {gotcha? Well actually, not so fast. I guess you imagined Qxf5 Nxf5 h1=Q? No, because Qxg7 mate!} h4 {Bang!} 45. Rh5+ {Double bang!} Qxh5 {last possibility} 46. Nxh5 Kg6 47. Qxg7+ Kxh5 48. Qg2 {and.... curtain... what a fight!} Kh6 49. Qxh2 {}
