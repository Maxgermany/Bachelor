1. d4 {On Thursday evening, for the first time I went one-on-one against a grandmaster in a chess game! I was playing board 1 for Oswestry A and played Keith Arkell who was playing board 1 for Newport A.} Nf6 {Keith and his brother Nick arrived late. The match was due to start at 7.30pm. At the request of the Newport captain I delayed starting the clock until 7.45pm.} 2. Nf3 {Perhaps as a consequence of this Keith rattled out his first moves.} g6 {I start to finachetto my bishop.} 3. c4 {He gains more central control.} Bg7 {I complete the fianchetto.} 4. Nc3 {He prepares e2-e4} d5 {I turn it into a Grunfeld Defence.} 5. cxd5 {He takes.} Nxd5 {I take back. I was rather expecting him to turn it into a modern way of handling the exchange variation with 6. e2-4.} 6. g3 {But he plays this, which was new to me.} O-O {I castle} 7. Bg2 {He completes his fianchetto.} c5 {The thematic attack on the centre.} 8. O-O {He castles.} Nc6 {I continue to develop.} 9. Nxd5 {He takes} Qxd5 {I take back.} 10. Be3 {He wants to play Ne5 discovering an attack on my queen. } c4 {Although this reduces the pressure on the white centre, This is quite playable.} 11. Ne5 {So he comes in with the discovered attack, as in Splosnov, Sergei (2367) vs. Votava, Jan (2505).} Qb5 {The queen needs to protect c4 and c6} 12. Nxc6 {He takes.} bxc6 {I take back.} 13. b3 {Still following Splosnov, Sergei (2367) vs. Votava, Jan (2505).} Be6 {And this is what Jan Votava(2505) played too.} 14. Rc1 {But here we depart company. Sergei Splosnov(2367) preferred b3xc4 immediately.} Rac8 {Although this move is not exactly bad, moving the a8 rook away from possible attack from Bg2 is a good idea, and so is protecting c6, as I am now threatening c4xb3, after the game Keith suggested Ra-d8 as being even stronger. Fritz likes Ra-b8 here.} 15. bxc4 {Now that c6 is protected this is virtually forced, as I was threatening c4xb3.} Bxc4 {So I take back, threatening e2.} 16. a4 {He hits my queen.} Qa6 {I drop back, keeping the pressure on e2.} 17. Re1 {He protects e2.} Rfd8 {And I am happy with my position. Knights are exchanged, all my pieces are developed to reasonable squares. My c6 is weak, but it should not be terminal.} 18. Qc2 {Attacking my bishop. Fritz puts white up at 0.15 - hardly anything.} Bd5 {I considered Be6 but it is even better to challenge his Bg2.} 19. Red1 {He improves the position of his Re1.} Bxg2 {I take his powerful bishop off.} 20. Kxg2 {He takes back.} Rd5 {I threaten Ra5 attacking a4.} 21. Rd3 {He prepares for that.} Rcd8 {Keith thought this move was a minor mistake. Fritz thinks it is best however. I thought I was getting rid of my weak pawn and leading to more exchanges. I was rather thinking I was getting near a drawable ending here.} 22. Qxc6 {So he takes.} Qxc6 {I take back.} 23. Rxc6 {He takes.} Bxd4 {I take.} 24. Rc7 {This was the move I missed on move 21. I ws expecting exchanges on d4.} Bxe3 {We wondered afterwards if there were improvements on this move, but Fritz thinks it is best. Fritz gives white an advantage of plus 1 now.} 25. Rxe3 {He takes back, attacking e7 and a7.} Rd8d7 {When I played my last move, I thought this defended both pawns. When I saw this position on the board, I saw what was coming...} 26. Rxe7 {This!} Rxe7 {So I take.} 27. Rxe7 {He takes back.} Ra5 {I attack his a pawn.} 28. Re4 {He defends.} f5 {This is probably a mistake. Fritz prefers Kg7. White's advantage goes up from plus 1 to plus 1.25 according to Fritz.} 29. Rd4 {The best square.} Kf7 {I activate my king.} 30. g4 {I think he wanted me to exchange, leaving him with a passed e pawn.} Kf6 {But I refuse. Fritz prefers taking, and gives white as only up 0.58.} 31. gxf5 {He takes.} gxf5 {I took this way - again to stop him from having a passed e pawn. Fritz prefers taking with the king and now gives white as up 1.01.} 32. Kg3 {He advances his king.} Kg5 {As do I.} 33. h4+ {He checks.} Kh5 {I played this to prevent any further advance of this pawn. Fritz prefers Kf6 and gives white as up 1.29 now.} 34. e3 {I think this is a bit of a waiting move, quietly improving his position.} h6 {Fritz prefers Rc5.} 35. Rc4 {Another waiting move.} Ra6 {And the same from me.} 36. Rc5 {Heading for a pawn exchange.} Rxa4 {I take.} 37. Rxf5+ {He takes.} Kg6 {Forced!} 38. Rc5 {Rook returns to c5.} a5 {"Passed pawns must be pushed"! Fritz says white is up 1.19 now.} 39. h5+ {White throws in a check.} Kg7 {King drops back. Although he had started about 20 minutes behind me, I think I had used more time that him now, but neither of us were in any time trouble.} 40. Rc6 {Rooks stops my king from advancing.} Ra1 {This seemed to me to be the natural move, but Fritz prefers Rb4 with an advantage of only 1.01 to white.} 41. Rg6+ {But now +1.20} Kh7 {Forced, if I want to keep my h pawn.} 42. Ra6 {He comes back behind my a pawn.} a4 {So I advance.} 43. Ra7+ {Another check, driving my king back.} Kg8 {Plus 1.31 now.} 44. Kf4 {King comes up, avoiding being checked by my rook with Ra8-g8+} a3 {I carry on advancing.} 45. Kf5 {His king carries on advancing. Fritz gives white as up 2.58 now.} a2 {Keith wondered if this may be a mistake too, as it stops my rook marking time with R8-a7-a8 and also maybe playing Ra7 and exchanging the a pawn for his f pawn.} 46. Kf6 {I think the game is lost now, and I will show you the final moves without further comments.} Kh8 47. Ra4 Kh7 48. Ra8 Rh1 49. Rxa2 Rxh5 50. f4 Rh1 51. Ra7+ Kg8 52. Kg6 Kf8 53. f5 Rh3 54. Ra8+ Ke7 55. f6+ Ke6 56. Re8+ {And black resigns. Keith said afterwards " You certainly did give a good account of yourself in our game. It could easily have been played between 2 GMs, or a GM and an IM, and were it on ''Chessbomb'', for example, there would be very few 'red' moves." Many thanks for reading.
