1. d4 {I wasn't sure what to expect from Carl since this is the first time that I played against him.  But, he started off with the QP.} d5 {And, this is how I always answer.} 2. Nc3 {?! Trying to win a pawn, but this was uncalled for as it is too aggressive.  And, it is not a time to deviate from guidelines.  The idea being is that after 1.d4, you need the c pawn which is why 2.Nc3 isn't the best move.  Much better was 2.Nf3  As now, it's blocked, and because Carl didn't follow that guideline, I'm gonna try to punish him.} Nf6 {So, I protect this way.  However, I have other ideas for Carl.} 3. Bg5 {I am not afraid of this move.  Whereas, I'd normally ignore it, I'm gonna try to trick Carl.  As now, my idea is trading my N for his B since you generally need the B.  The idea being is to make Carl face the consequences of developing his Nb1 so early.  Otherwise, I would've been more passive and allowed a pin knowing that it could be broken with a later ...Be7.  To my surprise Carl accepts the exchange, and that's when I favor my position.} h6 4. Bxf6 exf6 5. e4 {Carl tries to exchange my pawn.  But, I refuse, this time.  I felt that exchanging would benefit him here.} Bb4 6. Qf3 {And, that's when Carl brought his Q out.  It was to prevent me from destroying his K side pawn structures.  But, I have other ideas.} Nc6 {I generally follow the guidelines of not bringing the Nb8-c6 until the c pawn has advanced in 1.d4.  But, those are just guidelines.  The reason for breaking them is because I am threatening to win a pawn.  Luckily for me, Carl, misses this threat.} 7. a3 {Instead, he tries to get aggressive by attacking the N.  But, I don't care as I have a greater threat by taking the pawn as his Q will be under siege.} Nxd4 8. Qd3 {I am not surprised to see Carl defend by attacking it, but I don't need to retreat as my next move demonstrates.} Bc5 9. Qb5+ {?? This looks like a strong move but is a terrible that should've lost.  I didn't see this until earlier today.  But, this move should've lost the Q.  The problem here is that my next move was played much too quickly as that was the conditional move.  } c6 {?? As I was fixated on kicking his Q for tempo gain.  I generally agree with ION that when you see a good move, just play it.  As I generally don't follow that, "When you see a good move, look for something better."  It just didn't fit my style, but now that I think of it, I need to that a lot more often.  The first reason is because this is what GM Susan Polgar emphasizes to her student.  More importantly is because of what happened here.  This would normally be very good for what I mentioned since I'll use that time to castle.  But, there was something much better of the immeidate 9...Nxd5!  While that's generally obvious, it was not in our game as it got overlooked.  But, had I remembered that quote, I would not have missed that opportunity here.} 10. Qd3 O-O 11. Nf3 {Carl wants to win my B..  } dxe4 {But, I  had better ideas since this forks appears powerful.  It might not seem so, but we'll see the full affect with his next move.} 12. Nxe4 {As this allows me to pin his N.  The only asset is what's about to occur.} Re8 13. Nxd4 {As I was not ready to exchange.  But, it's certainly better then losing material.} Qxd4 14. O-O-O {?? This loses.  I'm surprised that Carl didn't think about what danger lies ahead.  As GM Susan Polgar, "You must ask yourself what does my opponent want?"  In this context, my goal was to win the N as it was en-prise.  So, 14.f3 was the only way to protect it. } Rxe4 15. f3 {Now, Carl goes for an attack, as he is trying to win my R.  But, I'm not going to allow counterplay here.} Rf4 16. g3 {Still trying to win my R.  But, I have better ideas.  Being ahead, I decide to liquidate Queens.} Qxd3 17. Bxd3 Be3+ {I now give Carl a taste of his own medicine.  He placed me in check much earlier, so I throw it all back.  When he gets out, I'll take another pawn.} 18. Kb1 Rxf3 19. Rde1 {Centralizing his R and trying to go after my B.} Be6 {That doesn't bother me since I take the time to complete my development.} 20. Be4 {Carl attacks my R.  But, I'm gonna fight back with my next move.} Bf2 21. Re2 Re3 {And, I attempt to liquidate R's.  While Carl prevents that, I'll exchange B's, instead.} 22. Rxf2 Rxe4 23. Rd2 {Trying to go for a K side attack.  Carl's threat is 24.Rhd1-Rd8 where it won't be easy to drive.} Kh7 {To prevent any nonsense, I start activating my K.} 24. h4 {And, he tries to get a pawn chain.  The other idea behind this move is a semi open file which is known to be dangerous.  I, however, am not bothered by this since I am the equivalent to a R up.} Re8 {And, that's when I decide to double up.  Just like with both R's on the seventh rank, they can be just as dangerous with two on one file.} 25. a4 {I don't know why Carl played this.  As this leaves his K vulnerable.  My guess is trying to make more room for his K.  But, if that's so, he can do it because I have other ideas which are very dangerous.} Bf5 {As now, I have full throttle attack.} 26. Ka2 g5 {As I try to further weaken Carl's K side structure.  The idea is that there is more pressure in that area.} 27. Rd6 {So, Carl attacks my pawn.} Re8e6 {And, I attempt to liquidate further.  } 28. Rd7 {But, Carl declines by going after a couple of my pawns.} Kg6 {? Similar to much earlier in the game, when I missed the opportunity to win his Q, this was played much too quickly.  I say that because it was too fast to consider any other move.  My fixation wasn't on just protecting a pawn.  More importantly, it was continuing to bring the K out with the idea of using it as a weapon.  However, this move is going to give Carl back a pawn.  Best was 28...Re7.  Not only does this protect both pawns, but at the same time, it, once again, threatens to liquidate R's.} 29. Rxb7 Re4e1 {Knowing what I did and seeing that my a7 is en-prise, I go right after his R.  Once he protects, I exchange on h4.  The idea is compromising Carl's semi open file.  That plan, however, is going to fail.  So, was thinking along the wrong lines.  As I thought it would work, but I overlook a variation that it will make it fail.} 30. Rh2 gxh4 31. gxh4 Kh5 {And, it's right here.  That's due to his h pawn.  Although it's not a passed pawn, it can become one.  Plus, it is dangerous, as Carl could use that pawn and his R, if I'm not careful.  I thought that his threat would start off with 32.h5+, and after 32...Kg5 while everything seems ok, black might plan something like Rb7-b8-g8 with an overwhelming check.  As those two R's on adjacent files, coupled with that pawn are known to be dangerous as well.  Even without a passed pawn, I could wind up in a lot of trouble.  If that happens, there would be a possiblity of Carl pulling a swindle and winning a lost game.  I was determined not to allow that, and therefore, stop any plans that he might have with his Rb7.  I do this by blocking his h4 pawn, even at the cost of a pawn.} 32. Rxf7 Kg6 {And, this is also applicable with what I said above.  I did mention about the other R.  Well he moved it to make that capture which is when I attacked it.  But, I kept that variation in mind which is why 32.Rxf7 was a conditional move as I had planned on Carl doing that to allow this.} 33. Rc7 h5 {The other idea behind that conditional move is that after he protected his R, I was going to stop Carl's h pawn from advancing any further with his move.  This is ironic but up until here, this is how the game was played.  On the next move, the position starts to become corrupt, so I speculate for a move.} 34. Rb7 {? What I know is that my a pawn was not on the 7th rank.  In fact, I believe that it was on the 6th rank.  I also know that the c2 pawn was attacked, so regardless of what was actually played, Carl's best move was 34.c4 or 34.c4.  By leaving it attacked, I am going to win another pawn.} Bxc2 35. Rb6 {But, this is when the position became too corrupt to continue.  What it looks like is that Carl made a terrible blunder here since I recorded 35...axb6 with a win for black.  It didn't exactly happen this way, but the diagram isn't completely inaccurate.  The only difference is the timing.  That's because Carl blundered the same R in a similar way later in the game.  So, like here, this allowed me to get an additional R for free in the actual game.  When that happened, black resigned because he was too far behind to continue.  The only difference is here that I made it occur earlier then how it happened in the game because the position became too corrupt to annotate any further, at this point. } axb6 {}
