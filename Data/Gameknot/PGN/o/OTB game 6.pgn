1. e4 e6 2. Bc4 c5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. O-O d5 {? Rips open the centre while uncastled. My first mistake.} 5. exd5 exd5 6. Bb5 Bd6 7. Ba4 {Touch move! This bishop move is meaningless, probably inaccurate. Kartic’s first mistake.} Nf6 {Preparing o-o, hoping Re1 doesn’t happen soon.} 8. h3 {Whew!} O-O 9. c3 {Huh, low on development and blocking the c3 square, perfect for the knight.} Bf5 {Completing my development.} 10. Bc2 {The meaning of c3 kind of becomes clear now.} Bd7 {Not trading my good bishop for his horrible one, but placing it on a worse square.} 11. Bd3 {Dude, you need more development! 4 LSB moves!} c4 12. Be2 {6 now} Re8 {Open file taken} 13. Ng5 {?? Asking for trouble. His 3rd mistake(2nd being moving his LSB too many times).} h6 14. Nf3 Bb8 {Preparing a simple checkmate along the h2-b8 diagonal.} 15. d3 {Preparing DSB development (finally!)} Qc7 16. dxc4 dxc4 17. Na3 Rd8 18. Nxc4 Bg4 {Better probably was Bxh3} 19. hxg4 {?? Didn’t see the masked battery.} Rxd1 20. Rxd1 Nxg4 21. Nfe5 {?? One of the final blunders.} Ngxe5 22. Nxe5 Qxe5 23. Re1 {???} Qh2+ 24. Kf1 Qh1# {Hope you enjoyed!}
