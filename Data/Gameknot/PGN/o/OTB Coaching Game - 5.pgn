[Opening "Sicilian (B20), Gloria variation"]

1. e4 {Mary also open with this.  The idea being is that, like me, she was also taught this opening by Jack.} c5 2. c4 {?! This is the first move where I corrected, but I didn't tell her it was a mistake or blunder.  Instead, I said, more common was 2.Nf3 for the Open Sicilian.  The reason I told her that was because, first, after seeing how she played last week, I think she's ready to learn about the more complicated defense.  Second, Jack still teaches the Open Sicilian Variation saying that it's the most common analyzed by GM's.  In fact, he told that to Perry.} d6 {Meanwhile, I just continue with the defense, as if, she played 2.Nf3 since this is still the main line. } 3. Nf3 {This is where she plays the move that I noted earlier, and what I also like is that it develops.} Nf6 {So do I by going right after e4.} 4. e5 {Protecting the e pawn.  Mary: We don't have to open the same way, do we?  Joe: No.  There's always different openings.  I said that so that she didn't think that her earlier move which I said was actually a mistake or blunder.} dxe5 {Meanwhile, I take.} 5. Nxe5 {I take back.  } Nc6 {In the meantime, I continue development.} 6. f4 {?! This is an inaccuracy which I forgot to point out because it doesn't develop, and it moves her weakest pawn.  At which point, she could wind up in trouble.  I say that due to reflecting back on TA's Q sac.  He usually sacs on f2 or f7 with the idea being that it's the weakest square so once that pawn is gone, even at the cost of his Q, one must be careful.  In other words, there's little to no room for errors, as otherwise, he forces the win.  The idea being that the weakest square is vulnerable which he can exploit.  And, that is something that Joe pointed which I forgot to mention, as we got involved with another chat.  In it, Mary said, "We have to lose pieces."  My response was, Not necessarily.  Mary: I mean, eventually.  Joe: Yes, at some point, pieces are exchanged.} Nd4 {The idea behind this is to threaten to do something nasty.  Although it appears to be unsound, there is a reason for this as I want her to learn.  So, the idea bing is to give Mary the equivalent to Homework.  I will be creating which is actually a test to see if she finds the right move.  Whether she does or not, I will tell her and why as it is a training session.} 7. b3 {Fianchettoing her LSB and getting a solid pawn chain.} Bf5 {In the process of creating that nasty threat, I also develop.  That is something else I also kept in mind.  So, I wasn't going to say anything (as otherwise, it's overcoaching), but I was evaluating.  Actually, I got what it wanted because it wasn't easy for her to find the threat.  Instead, Mary really had to think, and why it accomplished my goals is because the way you learn is by really taking the time to think to see what's happening.  As Jack always says, "Start Thinking."  But, she spotted it, nonetheless and with the right response.} 8. d3 {Joe: This is your best moves and it prevents the fork.  Mary: You and that evil fork.  The reason I stated that it was best was due to other alternative being 8.Bd3?? or 8.Nd3?? which both would've lost a piece due to my LSB.  So, she prevented all of that.} g6 {With her playing the right move and given that my DSB would be crambed (if I were to advance the e pawn), I decide to fianchetto it.  This, when I can bring it into play, it'll be in a better place.} 9. g4 {She, temporarly has a way around it, as Mary is threatening to win a piece.  This time, I had, about 8 hours of sleep, and I know what happened last time.  If I didn't know her strength and hadn't gotten enough rest before yesterday, I would've overlooked this which would've given her the advantage, instead.  So, I start thinking about where to retreat.  Now, I don't want to undevelop this on c8 (where it initially started.)  } Be6 {Therefore, aside from this, and what I mentioned a move earlier, the only other place I can go without losing a piece would be on d7.  The only problem is that my Q would be semi limited.  Not wanting to tie it down, undevelop, or lose anything, I decided to play, also keeping in mind that if Mary were to reattack with f5, she would lose a pawn.} 10. Bh3 {So, at last, Mary develops a piece.  But with almost all my pieces out, but I can use my developed pieces, as well as, the K to go on the attack.} Qa5+ {At this point, there was a lot of discussion on what to do.  So, this is where Jack got involved.  One thing he said is that we were doing something wrong by discussing too much, as opposed to, playing chess.  I told him that it's because I'm coaching her and when you train someone, there is a lot of discussion.  He said, "I know, but even so, there is too much."  Of course, Jack was following OTB tourney rules, and presumably, preparing us for that.  The idea being is that on GK, the rules aren't as strict.  And, coaching is allirght, as long as, you don't collude with anyonelse, aside from your opponent.  But, in OTB the rules are that, unless you announce check, offer, accept, or decline a draw, talking is considered cheating, and therefore, against the rules.  If you break that rule, you get disqualified.  In addition, the discussion was starting to distract Mr. Stockel and Petty.  So, Jack got involved, and when he did, that's when the position became corrupt which made it impossible to annotate any more.  It's a shame because this was the only one, and the game lasted, about as long as, the last annotation.  I can get exact numbers, but I estimate from experience that the game lasted, approximately, 60 moves.  What happened is that I won a lot of material and had a winning advantage.  Two make matters worse, I had both of my R's on one file with her remaining N directly pinned to her K, and I also had an LSB around which threatened a nasty discover and double check which would've won more material, immeidately.  In addition, there was an added threat of mate.  But, at the very end (due to being out of time) I made a terrible mistake that allowed her to get back a R, which Jack showed.  By then, it was a drawish position, but we left it as an unfinished game.  That's why I recorded the game as being in progress.  Had I not made that mistake, I would've said 0-1, as it would've been assumed that black had won.  But, I let Jack point out the moral of this story.  And, he stressed the importance of development and castling.  In it, he told Mary that she I developed my pieces and castled, whereas, she did not.  This is important because, as he accurately pointed out, I could've won the game.  I agreed and just before I left, I said that, sometimes, GM's make the same mistake pay the price by failing to do this.  Therefore, there are occasions where one must deviate from General Opening Guidelines, but in general you should follow it as the minor can work together to deliver a devastating attack.  And, the way to remember that is, "Openings must be used with the greatest care.  What you do in the opening will affect you in the middle game; what you do in the middle game will affect you in the endgame; what you do in the endgame will affect the final results." }
