1. e4 {Jack starts off with his usual.} c5 {As do I, and of course, we're in the Open Variation.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {I forgot that 4...Nf6 is the most common move.  But, it doesn't matter, as I will transpose into that since right after that, white plays the next move, anyhow, of 5.Nc3.  Therefore, the same move occurs, but in a different order.} 5. Nc3 Nf6 {As evidence, I was going to play this here, one way or another to develop and prepare to castle.} 6. Bg5 {I was wondering what to do here.  At first, I thought about attacking with 6...h6.  But, I was worried about putting compromises on my K, if I'm to castle.  Plus, for a similar reason, I'm not ready to exchange, yet.} e6 {So, I impose a pin which I know can and will easily be broken.} 7. Bd3 {Continuing with his development and preparing to castle.} Be7 {As do I.  In order to do it right away without waisting time, this move was necessary, as in this position, it would not be wise to fianchetto, for the same reason why doubled fianchetto's are generally not wise.  After which, he and I are both going to castle which means that we're both thinking alike here.  The only thing that I wasn't ready for was the exchange which comes right after.  But, for me, it's not as important if I can get my K to safety since the idea is, "Castle early and often".  And, that is, btw, the main chess quote that I try to follow all the time.} 8. O-O O-O 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Nce2 {With the threat that I had, Jack, as expected, defends.} e5 {So, I attack again.} 11. Nf3 {And, he defends again which enables me to impose a half pin on his Nf3.} Bg4 12. Ng3 {And, he breaks it.  As here, I was planning to exchange on f3 to mess up Jack's pawn structures.  Seeing the threat does not surprise me knowing that it wasn't going to be easy.  But, with the move played, however, I refuse to exchange since he can recapture with the Queen instead.} Nc6 {So, I complete my development.} 13. h3 {Attacking my B, and presumably, trying to get a semi open file.} Be6 {And, for the reason noted earlier, I wasn't willing to exchange here.} 14. c3 {I am not sure why Jack played this.} d5 {But, wondering and then not knowing what else to do here, I am now ready to exchange since I can't think of anything and don't want to get into complicated variations against him. } 15. exd5 Qxd5 16. Bc2 {Trying to exchange Queens.} Qa5 {But, I refuse.  However, I think that taking on d5 would've been better because of what's to come since Jack's Queen is going to become a monster.} 17. Qd3 {As he is threatening mate.} g6 {At first, I overlooked this and attacked his Queen with 17...Rad8 which is the same mistake a student made against me.  And, with it, the mentoring started.  Jack: Is 17...Rad1 a good move?  Joe: I didn't know what the Queen wanted.  Oh, you're trying to mate me.  Jack: How many times must I tell you to look at your King first?} 18. Ne4 {He continued here by saying, "You must always look at your King first.  Not just once, but all of the time."  Now comes an interesting threat, which I overlooked. } Rad8 {?? As this is where I thought that it was safe to attack the Queen with the idea of defending but inaccurately.  He was trying to get my B, but I thought it was safe here.  My thought was that if he is to take, I'll recapture.  So, I didn't trust, and was thus, sure that he wasn't going to grab my Bishop.  But, similar to what we've seen in other games, I became overly confident.  That's because I overlooked, that I'll be in check once he takes which will leave me a piece down.} 19. Nxf6+ Kg7 20. Nh5+ {He checks again, and it gets interesting.} Kh6 {?? This loses right away.  Nothing else should've come into consideration, aside from 20...gxh5.  The reason for not playing that is because I thought that 21.Qxh7+ is mate as I told Jack when he asked.  But, it is not.  By playing this, however, Jack now has a mate in two.  } 21. Qe3+ {With that being said, I resigned here because after 21...Kh5 which if forced, 22.Qg5# is mate.   After the game, we reviewed that and he asked me why I didn't take his Nh5 with 20...gxh5.  When I told him the reason, he said that, in the future, I'm gonna need to study the position a little bit more, just like in our first game.  The solution here is also taking a little longer to look at the position.  But, you will be shocked at what else develops.  So, capturing would've helped, but the positon was still lost for black due to my Queen being out of play.  That's when I remember to be a spectator of my own game, based on if I agree or see something different.  I usually agree, but in this case, I see something different.  With that, I don't completely agree with his assessment.  As I believe that 20...Kh6?? was the losing blunder, in it of itself.  For had I taken back, and Jack had taken back, I have made up for lost material and would have plenty to fight for.  Not only that, but his attacking forces against my King would not have been as strong.  So, there would've been a chance for me to get a draw.  But, by moving the monarch the way I did, black was busted because of what happened afterwards.  After this game, Jack went back to making a mistake, in which I got a piece, but moved a little quickly.  Then, I messed up in the endgame since I had to leave.  In doing so, it ended in a draw.  The moral of this story is what Jack and I discussed in the Men's Room while saying goodbye.  So, on top of taking enough time, he said that one the things that must come into consideration is the K.  And, that I need to watch out for it's safety.   I agree with him there since K safety is very important, as Jack Stockel has previously emphasized with this being the perfect example.}
