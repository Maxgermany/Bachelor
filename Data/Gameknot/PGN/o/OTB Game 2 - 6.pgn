[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {I anticipated this because this is also what he plays.  So, I stick with my usual for now.} c5 2. d3 {This move took me off guard.  But, it's a small way of learning how intense openings can be.  I'm used to seeing 2.Nf3 or even 2.d4 played in the Sicilian Defense.} d6 {But, I am not intimidated yet and certainly not overwhelmed, as I calmly stick to my usual.  As I play the same move that I would've played were the other moves by black played.  Needless to say that there is nothing new from black here.} 3. Be3 {That is, until Tom plays this.  Now, we're in unfamiliar territory.  And, although not taught this by kenneth_fiore_3 what I remember from Yoga class is that one must be calm and collected.  In other words, it's about keeping the gaze still and mind quiet.  That's what it takes to become a better, as in the past, even after that game, I'd feel overwhelmed and cope with the Fight or Flight Syndrome which is quite bad as it has caused me to rush which resulted in terrible mistakes that shouldn't have been made.  It's about knowing how to handle that unfamilar territory as I learned with charleshiggie in his past annotations.  Keeping the guaze still and mind quiet means staying calm at all times.  Be it note that the reason for mentioning Yoga is that what I was wondering for years was how to handle the Fight or Flight Syndrome.  The bad part is that no coaching or mentoring game has helped me with that.  Instead, all of my questions were answered by going to the Yoga classes, over the past 2-4 years.  } Nc6 {Therefore, with meeting something new, I try something different, as well.  And, that's by calmly developing on the Q side.  I'm just thinking about what this N, in the long term might be capable of doing.  And, what comes to mind is what I learned in the Deeper Chess Theory Club about the N visualization count.  With that, one of the things I'm asking myself is what I learned from GM Susan Polgar and kenneth_fiore_3.  So, the real question is can I bring this N to a more active post.  If it's yes, then that will play a powerful role.} 4. Nc3 {I guess that Tom is asking himself the same question.} Nf6 {Meanwhile, I develop the other N with ideas of castling later on.} 5. Nf3 {As does he.} g6 {Not knowing what else to do, I fianchetto.  Be it worth noting that I like forming the nice long flanks.  So, if I don't if there's anything wrong with it or not, I just assume that it's good move.  That's generally not a good way to go, though, because more careful analysis should be used.  It boils down to taking a little more time.  With that being said, if this game were played on GK, I would've taken more time and used analyze the board, which I'm spoiled by.  But, in OTB chess, I feel that I get a little careless due to feeling too comfortable, which is similar to what happened in my game with Ken.  I feel it's good and play with OTB games, rather then, giving it a closer look since I don't know what else to consider here.  In this context, the only other move that came into consideration was 5...e6 with a similar idea.  With this move played, however, I feel that my Be8 will have better mobility, once I develop it.} 6. Be2 {Meanwhile, Tom continues with his development.} Bg7 {As do I by completing the fianchetto.} 7. Qd2 {Giving his Be3 more support, as Tom plans to exchange.} O-O {But, nothing stops me from castling, at once.  And, Tom is thinking the same way since he will play the same move.} 8. O-O Bg4 {This is going to force and exchange.} 9. d4 {Instead, he wants to exchange pawns.   I accepted, but probably didn't look deep enough at the variations since I'm still known to not study enough.  In fact, I am guilty of still only looking at one variation, from time to time.  I might wind up asking Susan Polgar how many variations at once to study because, in general, the most I analyze is 3.  I have a feeling that more then that would be needed.  As this is an example of me analyzing only one line.  The reason for exchanging was to prevent 10.Ne5  As not only do are my only options to exchange pieces or lose tempo, but Tom would have a nice pawn chain which I was determined to prevent because of what Susan Polgar said about this in a variation of the French Defense.  What I thought very shortly about but should've looked at deeper is what happens after 10.d5, Nb4  As I thought that Tom could get a discovered attack on my N by moving his Nc3.  But, it was protected by the very pawn that I exchanged.  Had I taken this into consideration, I would have tried to refuse the exchange with 9...Nh5, or 9...Nd7.} cxd4 10. Nxd4 Ne5 {Tom also wanted to exchange my Nc6 for his N.  But, I refused because I felt that my N was stronger then his Nd4.  What comes to mind is the Visualization Count and, consequently, how much mobility it can get by moving it.} 11. Nf3 {And, Tom was worried about a different exchange which I could have accepted earlier.  But, I can understand why he thought that.} Qa5 {Not knowing what his Nc3 might be capable of later on, I decide to pin it since this appears to be his stronger Knight.  What I overlooked is what comes next because Tom is going to force an exchange that I did not desire.  Had I been a little bit more careful, I would've been to refuse the exchange by relocating my Ne5 since I wasn't ready to do it here.} 12. Nxe5 Qxe5 13. Bf4 {As it also gives Tom tempo with this move.} Qh5 14. h3 {Hitting my Bishop which is going to force another exchange.  Being that what's attacked is pinned, I must prevent Tom from winning a piece.} Bxe2 15. Nxe2 {? I thought that he would take back with the Queen which would certainly force another unwanted exchange.  But, with this move, I feel happy about him exchanging as this enables me to win a pawn by hitting his Queen.  } Nxe4 16. Qe3 Bxb2 {?? But, this is an example of where to take is a mistake.  The only thing that came into consideration was the idea of winning his R for a N, in it's aftermath due to Tunnel Vision.  Of course, I kept the last move in mind but thought that I was winning material.  But, after I retreat, he takes with the N, instead of the Bishop, which is going to lose a piece, in return.  That leaves me the equivalent of a pawn down.  There is still hope though because with extra pawns on the board, I will need those endgames strategies more then anything else.} 17. Rab1 Be5 18. Qxe4 Bf6 {The reason for this retreat was to avoid exchanging.} 19. Ng3 {And, Tom hit's my Queen, instead.} Qa5 {So, I switch sides of the board to put pressure on his Q side, instead since his a2 is under fire.} 20. a4 {Which Tom protects.} d5 {So, I hit his Queen.  Although it's not called this, it's the same idea as Hope Chess as I am hoping that Tom takes his Queen off of the fourth rank so that I can win back a pawn.  But, that is exactly what happened.} 21. Qf3 Qxa4 22. Qxd5 Qxc2 {?? Being fixated on exchanging pawns do to the Tunnel Vision, I overlooked that I could have won a piece for pawn with 22...Qxf4} 23. Rbc1 {Not wanting to chance anything, Tom attacks my Queen.} Qb2 24. Ne4 {As now, he is going for an exchange} Kg7 {Due to Ghost Vision, I inadvertently allowed the exchange, anyhow.  It appeared that Tom had a threat of the win of material of checkmate.  But, what happened here is that I, somehow, got my Queen mixed up with his Queen due to where my King was located.  To get out of trouble, I thought that this was necessary.  However, I was wrong here.  Had this not happened, it would've refused with 24...Bd4 since the reality is that it is protected by my Queen.  And, what I mean by reality here is if I didn't have that episode of Ghost Vision.} 25. Nxf6 exf6 26. Qf3 {I am not sure why Tom played this.} a5 {But, what I remember is that passed pawns must be pushed.} 27. Qg3 {Maybe, Tom was worried about my K side.  But, I keep pushing my passed pawn since it is protected by my Ra8.} a4 28. Qh4 {But, I stopped here since it appeared that Tom had a threat.  More importantly, I remembered that when you find a good move look for something better.  So, I get that opportunity to win his B for two pawns with this upcoming fork.} g5 29. Bxg5 fxg5 30. Qxg5+ {With that being said, this check does not bother me.} Kh8 31. Qh5 {At first, I didn't see the point behind this move.} f6 {?? I thought Tom would try to stop this pawn with Rc4 followed by Rc1.  Somehow, I got a little nervous.  But, best was to continue pushing with 31...a3  With the move played, I just threw my advantage.} 32. Qh6 {As now, there is pressure against my K side.} Qa3 {?? Which I thought that I had stopped, but this is the losing blunder because of what comes next.  Instead, I could've, at least, held a draw with 32...Rf7  But, it's all over for black now. } 33. Rc7 {And, I resigned here because I am gonna have to give up a Rook to avoid mate without anything else in return.  As, the only option is 33...Rf7, and after Tom takes, I've got nothing else to fight for or learn from.  In the end, Jack, my opponent, and I analyzed this position.  According Jack, there was nothing that black could have done to prevent this, as white had an overwhelming attack and took advantage of it.  But, I know that he is wrong here because if I had played 31...a3! white would not have been able to break through.  And, after coming down, 32...Rf7 would've, at the least, been able to hold a draw.  As Tom would not have been able to break through.  Once he did, white had an overwhelming amount of attacking forces against my K for black to stand a chance.  }
