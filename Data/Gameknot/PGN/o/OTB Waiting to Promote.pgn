[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {I'm white.  OTB me vs my coworker Ian.  Look deeply, there are some very interesting combo's at work during this game.  As per usual ....e4!} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Philidor's defense, against my kings knight opening, according to the database...thus far following the lines.} Bg4 {Standard lines are now broken, it's all out freedom henceforth.  (Not that we knew we were following the lines.  haha)} 4. Be2 Nc6 5. d5 {close the game up a little bit, and make his N move.} Bxf3 {Probably a dubious move, no real need for death at this point...poor noble steed deserved better.} 6. Bxf3 Nd4 7. O-O {I don't LIKE his knight here, but I am not too awfully concerned.  I have plans to remove him from his lofty stall. } Be7 {I remember we discussed that his kings side was looking a little stagnant.  He begins to develop.} 8. Be3 Bf6 {This move keeps him from going down a pawn after the trade and my QxP.} 9. c3 Nxf3+ 10. Qxf3 {The ruddy horseman has been relieved of his duties. Sometimes the clergyman must suffer for the good of the people. } Bg5 11. Nd2 {I decide on this to develop the N, and if he does BxB then my PxB showing a checkmate on Qxf7# if he's not paying attention.  Ya never know, other than doubling my pawns it does not real damage, and it's a quick chance at victory. } Bxe3 12. fxe3 Nh6 {Oh well, in normal fashion he did notice the mate threat.  He actual complained about it out loud before making the move.  haha!} 13. c4 O-O 14. Rad1 {Figured while there was a lull in the action I would try for a sneak attack on his queen.  I was planning on c5, his pxp, my N-c4, then advancing my d5 pawn having my Rook and N as back up....just a small side plan.} f5 { This move threw a quick wrench in my process.  I had to think carefully about this move. } 15. Qh3 {This move, albeit not the greatest spot for Elizabeth, turns out later to be a saving grace. } f4 16. c5 {figured I would proceed with my original plan of attacking his queen. } Qg5 {This was another moment where I had to think for a while.  We sat staring at the board for several long minutes.  I was wondering if he was going to trap and trade Queens with Q-g4. But that would've been too boring.  I am glad he didn't do that.} 17. Nf3 Qg6 18. cxd6 Ng4 {Now here he's doing 2 things, he's blocking my Queen from the diagonal to c8, and he's threatening a tremendous forkjob on my castles.} 19. dxc7 {However, now this little pawn is going to be a major thorn in blacks backside.  That pawn ends up winning me the game. } fxe3 20. Rdc1 {I'm finished with his forking opportunities.} Rac8 {He wisely gaurds the pawn.  However, there's a plot-a-foot.  } 21. Nxe5 {Now if he takes NxN, I take Rf1xR+, he takes RxR, my pawn turnes into a queen, my QxQ+, forces his Q-e8, QxQ#  white wins...  } Rxf1+ 22. Rxf1 Qxe4 23. Nxg4 e2 {Now he's threatening and saving his pawn from my N} 24. Nh6+ {!!  This he didn't see coming. Now his Rook is toast, and the game is all but won for white.} gxh6 25. Qxc8+ Kg7 26. Qf8+ {Now I must wait for the right moment to promote my pawn!} Kg6 27. Qf6+ Kh5 28. Rf5+ Kg4 29. Rf4+ {I sack the Rook here because he was in my way of my soon to be Queen, plus it keeps him in Check...} Qxf4 30. c8=Q+ {Seems to be the right moment now!} Kh5 31. Qh3+ Qh4 {Forced} 32. Qhxh4# {A quick end to the Reign De La Negro.  Waiting to promote my pawn was huge.  I found this game quite interesting.  If I had to guess i would say not taking my C-pawn sooner is what sealed the deal.  Good game though, especially for in the office over the board. }
