1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Further to my earlier game, I was given the opportunity to co-ordinate a successful mating attack against a kingside castling position.  Funnily enough, Glenda ended up being a mere spectator in this game, but the minor pieces managed to get together and co-ordinate a successful mating attack.  Here is how it happened.  We start off with the Ruy Lopez, an opening I normally play in a double king pawn opening should black's second move be Nc6.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O {5. 0-0 - I end up tucking Henry away on the kingside.  This is a pretty standard main line Lopez.} b5 6. Bb3 Bc5 {6. ..... Bc5 - this is a more unusual line of the Lopez.  It is perfectly playable and hits out at my f2 pawn.  However, this proves not to be a problem.} 7. c3 O-O 8. d4 exd4 9. cxd4 {9. cxd4 - pawn trade.} Bb6 10. e5 {10. e5 - pawn stab.} Ne8 11. Bg5 Nf6 {11. ..... Nf6 - after the last few moves, disaster strikes for black.  In order to preserve his queen he must move his knight back into my e pawn's attack.  Not only does black lose a piece but the following storm breaks.} 12. exf6 g6 13. Nc3 {13. Nc3 - I develop my queen knight and open clear lines for my rooks.  This knight will eventually have a part to play in the final denoument.} Re8 14. Nd5 Rb8 15. Ne7+ {15. Ne7+ this knight penetrates right into the heart of black's position.} Kh8 16. Re1 Ba5 17. Bxf7 {17. Bxf7 - I ignore the attack on my rook because I need to tear black apart!} Bxe1 18. Bxe8 Qxe8 19. Qxe1 {19. Qxe1 - suddenly a passed pawn appears on f6 and Glenda2 threatens to make an appearance on f8.  Next move, another new white knight is gonna appear on black's block.} Bb7 20. Ne5 Nxe7 {20. ...... Nxe7 - black gets rid of one of those steeds, but one little pawn is gonna make the final statement to Friar.  Your king or your queen!} 21. f7 Qc8 {21. ..... Qc8 - Friar chooses sudden death and Fou Lenoir reads the black king his last rites next move.  Next up will be my game with jkarp.  Again, watch this space.} 22. Bf6# {}
