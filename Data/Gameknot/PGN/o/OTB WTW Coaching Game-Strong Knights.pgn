1. e4 {So, I always like to respond with the King's Pawn Opening.  This is still my favorite because I believe that it gives me more options then any other opening, which is the only reason why I agree with GM Bobby Fischer's statement of, "best by test".} c5 {And, this is his favorite.  That's right, he likes the Sicilian more then any other defense.  As we all know, I am on the same page because this also my favorite.  Of course, this will become a standard Open Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {Guess what?  Although this is completely different from a Ruy Lopez, this move is bases on that since white generally attacks a N during the opening.  This should make for interesting play  Therefore, I do not think that I can go wrong by moving here, and my instincts are dead on.  That's because my opponent said, "you attacked my N.  Very interesting." } e5 {So, he responds by attacking my N.  But, it does, however, leave his N pinned.} 7. Nf3 {This is the only place to retreat my N without giving up my piece or exchanging.  Normally, an even exchange isn't bad, but in this position, it would double up my pawns because 7.Nf5, 7...Bxf5 8.exf5.  On a normal basis, I don't care too much about doubled pawns, but Mr. Stockel make a big deal about them.  He says that doubled pawns usually puts you at a disadvantage.  And, if I voluntarily double them up, my opponent will get upset with me.  I know because I have done this before, and he is my coach.  So, you have to go by what he says.} Nc6 {I understand that the only thing he was thinking about was development.  But, I don't why he played this, as opposed to, 7...Be7. } 8. Bc4 {But, in this position, I am determined to castle on my next move and continue with development.  So far, I have not made any mistakes, but neither has my opponent.  The question is based on what schakertjie told me in a different annotation.  How do you improve your position?  Well, this is certainly a way to do that.} Be7 {In the meantime, black is also improving his position.  This move breaks a pin.  But, most importantly, like my last move, he played for development and so that he can castle on his next move.} 9. O-O {! Normally, I would not mark this with an exclamation because it's just a standard move.  So, why did I do that?  Because Mr. Stockel said, "You castled.  That's a good move.  I can do the same."  Basically, it is a case of, "Two can play that game."  } O-O 10. Qe2 {At this point, I am determined to complete the development, and this is the move that does it.  With that in mind, I believe that I now have the advantage.  But, I have to be careful in order to maintain, as someone told me in a different annotation and Jack Stockel has repeatedly stated.} Bg4 {With my edge, he decides to take advantage by pinning my N and continuing with his development so that the game is near even again.} 11. Rae1 {? At this point, I make a decision to connect my R's.  And, this is something that I am obsessed, even more so then I ever was with N fork's, for some reason.  However, this is my first mistake, this time.  That's because of what is about to unfold shortly.} Nd4 {And, this is why 11.Rae1?  Right now, I want to avoid exchanging N's due to K safety.  In other words, this move guarantees a hole and doubled pawns around my K which is the last thing I want because of the fact that it has led to problems in some of my past games.} 12. Qd3 {! Now, 11...Nd4 does much more then I just mentioned.  It put my N at risk because after say ...BXP, I thought that my only choice QXB?? which just loses the Q after ...NXQ.  But, I forgot about my g2 pawn, so I could have retaken with that.  So, I did miscalculate, but I am still marking with an exclamation point.  Why?  Because Jack Stockel said, "You played this?  That's good."} Nxf3+ {Of course, an exchange is still forced which I don't like because I have to with my pawn.  As noted earlier, this is about K safety.  But, I don't have a choice because if instead, 13.Qxf3??, 13...Bxf3, losing the Q for a B.  So, because of 11.Rae1? black now has the advantage. } 13. gxf3 Qd7 {At first, I did not know why he played this, but I figured it out.  Like I mentioned earlier, this move completes black's development.} 14. Nd5 {?? At this point, I want to exchange N's which I will be successful in doing so, but despite what I said earlier, this is my first serious mistake.  In fact, it is not just a mistake, but rather, a blunder.  According to my opponent, this is actually the losing blunder, but the decisive mistake comes later (toward the end).  But, why is this a weak move?  Well, the reason here is the lesson, and the lesson is the moral of this game.  And, here's the thing, the moral of my games against Jack are more important then the losing move because chess is not about winning or losing, but rather, learning from your mistakes.  Now normally, the moral comes during your costly mistake, but that's not the case here.  In this position, his f6 N is strong and dangerous, and after we exchange by eliminating the Knights, I am going to have a lot of problems.  So, according to Mr. Stockel, best was actually 14.Ne2.  Now normally, it doesn't matter if the remains where it is.  You just don't want it to approach the end ranks, near the opponents K.  But, in a case like this, his N is so powerful that you can't allow it to come past the fourth or fifth rank, as it will cause problems towards the end, even if the N disappears.  Therefore, you have to be very careful on how the strong the N is.  In this case, I went wrong by recognizing it's strength, even though I still have a chance in this game.  Overall, I learned about how, where, and why a N can become a dangerous, especially if it is dominant over the other Knight.} Nxd5 15. Bxd5 Bh3 {So, it appears that he is just wants to win my R, or is there more to this then meets the eye?  That remains to be seen.} 16. Kh1 {Of course, I know that he can exchange my f1 R for his LSB, and that would be the least of my problems.  What I was worried about and looking at was a possible mate, he play something like ...Qg4.  However, that was a miscalculation and until I reexamined the position.  What I completely forgot was that I was protected by the doubled, and that is going to become very important, as we will see very shortly.} Qg4 {He decides to move his Q.  At first, I thought that this was a serious mistake because I actually wind up taking his DSB, but what I think would give me the advantage actually winds up becoming the costly mistake and worst move of the entire game.  } 17. Bxe7 {?? Because his Q moved, I thought that it was feasible to get the bishop.  In addition, I thought that this move would win his f8 R for my DSB, but that is not the case.  In addition, there is way more to this story then meets the eye.  First, as mentioned in the Intro, this was my first game against this opponent in over two months.  While that might seem irrelevant, it plays an essential role on how I play some of my games because I miss out on the threats that I used to not overlook.  So, I need to get back in the game.  Second, instead of taking the B, I could have gotten a free Q with 17.fxg4!! which would have been the best move of this game, and that is why those doubled pawns could have played an essential role.  With that in mind, it would have been the winning move, as opposed to what will become the decisive mistake (actual losing blunder.)  Third, but most importantly, this move will lead to a mate in one, after 17...Qg2#. } Qg2# {}
