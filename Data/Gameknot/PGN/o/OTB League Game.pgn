[Opening "Caro-Kann (B18), classical, Flohr variation"]

1. e4 {I always open with e4 as I'm relatively new to OTB chess and I'm trying to play the same opening enough that I'm comfortable with it. I usually play into the Italian game if I can.} c6 {I recognised this as the caro-kann, although I'm not really familiar with it other than black is going to play d5 next.} 2. d4 {Following the rule that after e4, play d4 if possible, and I don't see any reason not to.} d5 {Usual caro-kann follow up.} 3. Nc3 {Defending the e pawn and developing a piece. I spent a little bit of time looking at what should come next if ..dxe4, Nxe4 and then if ..Bf5, Ng3 seems to save the tempo by forcing the bishop to retreat, plus g3 seems like a reasonable square for the knight. As it happens, this is exactly the line taken over the next few moves.} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 {As previously described.} Bg6 {Makes sense, keeping blacks only developed piece on the board on a fairly good diagonal where my queen is tied to defending the c2 pawn.} 6. Bc4 {Just a developing move really, also with the advantage of pointing at the weak f7 square. I also looked at Nf3, but this felt a bit more direct.} e6 {Well there goes the threat on f7. Also d5 looks like a nice outpost for a knight if black can maneuver his way there.} 7. Nf3 {Developing, and again protecting d4 to give the queen the scope to move a bit. In hindsight I feel maybe Nge2 was a better move, as this would have made it easier for my DSB to emerge later in the game. I looked at this at the time but felt I shouldn't block the half open e-file.} h6 {I guess this is to keep the bishop on because if white plays Ne5, I can force the bishop off for a knight.} 8. O-O {Castling seemed reasonable at this point, with no immediate threats or tactical opportunities that I noticed.} Nf6 9. c3 {Mainly played this to free up the queen that was tied to the defence of c2, this also allows the queen and f3 knight the opportunity to go elsewhere should the need arise, Qb3 as a follow up looked interesting although the response ..b5 makes life a bit awkward after that.} Be7 10. Ne5 {e5 looked like a nice outpost for the knight. Ne5 played mainly with a view to forcing the bishop to give up the nice diagonal it has, it has no retreat squares other than h7, which isn't all that great.} Bh7 {Black tries to hold onto the bishop.} 11. Bd3 {The white LSB wasn't doing much where it was while blacks had a good diagonal, so it seems like a good idea to more or less force a trade. Black can play Bg8 (terrible place for the bishop), or g6 to keep the bishop, but neither looks enticing.} Bxd3 12. Qxd3 {Retaking with the queen in order to bring another piece out.} Nbd7 {Challenging my knights position. I had to be wary at this point that if I ignored the challenge, then ..Nxe5 wins a knight, since the capture would uncover a pin on the d4 pawn.} 13. Nf3 {I spent a long time here looking at something like Ng6, threatening the rook or taking the black DSB off. If fxg6 then Qxg6 check with a follow up of Nh5 threatening mate on g7. Black is defending h5 though so could exchange, and Bxh6 didn't seem to help either. I came to the conclusion that there was no combination on here so gave up on that idea after running a few minutes off my clock!  I considered that the threat of a later Ne5 may come in useful, so opted to retreat for now.} c5 {Black challenges the d4 pawn.} 14. Qc2 {dxc5 ..Bxc5 looks good for black as the bishop would be nicely placed (as opposed to my bishop that hasn't moved all game), also I was wary of the previously mentioned pin on the d4 pawn so with this in mind I retreated the queen. I was trying to maximise my control on the white squares also with black having no LSB, so keep my queen on the diagonal.} Rc8 {This is quite a clever move in my opinion, as black can create a new pin on the c3 pawn shortly.} 15. h3 {I'd looked at a few options here, particularly with a view to getting the DSB out (neither it or the a1 rook have moved all game), but I was concerned about ..Ng4 had I played Be3. So this move was really to restrict the options of the f6 knight.} cxd4 16. Nxd4 {Retaking with the knight, as clearly cxd4 is a bad idea.} Nb6 {The black knight becomes a bit more active, plus with the c3 pawn pinned to the queen, my d4 knight is hanging.} 17. Rd1 {This move both defend the knight and presents a tactical threat - if white could play Nxe6 from this position, he wins a pawn and the queen for the rook and knight.} Nbd7 {Black sees the threat and retreats the knight. He offered me a draw at this point - the game did seem even to me, however with us needing to win both games to salvage a draw from the match, and there still being some chess to be played from here, I decided to play on.} 18. Qb3 {Threatening the b7 pawn - I wasn't terribly happy with this move, but I'd spent a lot of time over the last few moves and didn't want to get into time trouble, and couldn't see a lot wrong with this. it at least removes the pin from the c3 pawn as well.} Qb6 {Offering the exchange. I felt a bit like black was playing for a draw from here, as he was quite exchange happy.} 19. Qb5 {if Qxb6 ..Nxb4 I didn't like the look of a later ..Nc4 and couldn't see a good way of stopping the knight causing trouble, so if there's to be an exchange, I'd rather it was on my own terms.} Qxb5 {Black takes the exchange.} 20. Nxb5 {Only move.} a6 {Forcing the knight back.} 21. Nd4 {I guess Nd6+ was an option here that I missed at the time, forcing black to exchange bishop for knight, that might have been better than what I actually played. Again I wasn't doing too well for time, so played fairly quickly from here (more time is added after move 30).} O-O 22. Bd2 {Finally after 22 moves the DSB leaves it's home square, I had been very conscious of it's lack of involvement so far (and the blocking in of the a1 rook), I moved it here as I also wanted to advance my Q-side pawns to light squares, so they don't become a weakness in view of only dark squared bishops being left on the board.} Nc5 23. b3 {I begin the planned advance.} Nce4 {Offering another exchange.} 24. Nxe4 {I take the exchange, I wanted to keep the bishop on if possible.} Nxe4 25. c4 {Since c3 was under a double attack, I couldn't see anything better. Black can of course force the DSB off now.} Rfd8 {The d4 knight is hanging, so Black threatens it while staking a claim on the open d file.} 26. Nf3 {I looked at Be3 as well but after ..Nc3 that looks a bit messy, so this seemed the better option to avoid losing material.} Nxd2 27. Nxd2 {Another exchange, retaking with the knight seemed better, in case of something like Rxd2 ..Rxd2, Nxd2 ..Bg5. I'm not sure if it makes much difference.} Rd7 {Preparing to double on the d-file and taking full control of it.} 28. Nf3 {I don't want black to have control of the only open file so feel I have no choice but to challenge it.} Rcd8 29. Rxd7 {Obviously with fewer pieces on the board it would be harder to win but I don't want black to have full control of the d-file.} Rxd7 30. Kf1 {The king moves over with the idea of controlling d2 after Ke1 or Ke2. Obviously the black rook getting to d2 would be a major problem. I couldn't see any way for black to force the issue, nor for white to mount an effective attack from here. The other game had ended in a draw by now so the match was already lost, with this in mind I offered a draw here and black accepted.}
