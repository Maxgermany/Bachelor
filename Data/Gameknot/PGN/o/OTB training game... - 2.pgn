1. e4 e5 2. f4 {for some reason, I am starting to appreciate this: this opening is so ancient, that only modern players can crack it...} d6 {a sound reply: after Nf6, Black can play Bg4, and then there is Qh4+...} 3. Nf3 {so this is practically forced...} Bg4 {not many options here: White could try d3, g3, or just get this over with...} 4. h3 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 Nf6 {not bad for Black...} 6. g4 h6 {against g5, also introducing Nh7...} 7. Bc4 {White needs to castle: this also hinders d6-d5...} g5 {an unexpected move: but White has to react in some way; losing f4 is not a real option, and also fxe5 and fxg5 look shady...} 8. f5 {so we play this: this makes Blacks' position impenetrable for now, probably the reason he played this; it also opens up the DSB diagonal, after playing the d-pawn......} Nc6 9. c3 Bg7 10. d3 {at this point both players have to decide, whether to castle long or short...} a6 {here is a clue for White: Black is preparing b5, and take actions on the Queens' wing...} 11. Be3 Na5 {giving Bc4  no means of escape: after c6, the Bishop gets trapped...} 12. Nd2 {making the most of it: the Knight can recapture at c4 or b3; also development...} b5 {losing no time: Bd5 is not an option after c6...} 13. Bb3 {so this is forced...} Nc6 {very clever: now, the a-pawn will march: and Bd5 remains useless...} 14. d4 {but there is something to be done...} exd4 {Black can not allow d4-d5...} 15. cxd4 Nd7 {another unexpected move: opening a crossfire at d4...} 16. Qf2 {the only feasable reply...} Qf6 17. e5 dxe5 18. Bd5 exd4 19. Bxd4 Qxd4 20. Qxd4 Bxd4 21. Bxc6 O-O-O 22. O-O-O Nb6 23. Nf3 {we need to snuff this out, before it gets bad: White is a pawn behind, and is losing momentum...} Bc5 {I would have played Bg7...} 24. b3 {keeping Nb6 at bay...} f6 {against Ne5...} 25. h4 {but White has tempo left...} Nd7 {trying to make play: but White finds a way...} 26. Rd5 h5 {after Rhd1, Black needs counterplay: but this is not it...} 27. hxg5 fxg5 28. Nxg5 {the tables have turned...} Rhf8 {forced: against Nf7, forking both rooks; after Rdf8, Bxc7+: in retrospect, hxg4 was best: Nd7 is lost anyway...} 29. Ne6 {only to get forked in a worse way: now, four pieces are under attack...} Rfh8 {not sure, if this is the way out...} 30. Rhd1 Ba3+ {desperate...} 31. Kc2 Rdg8 {trying to run from it...} 32. Rd5xd7 {showing no mercy...} Bd6 {disrupting the rooks coordination for now, but this is mainly to cover against Rxc7+: maybe Black should have considered h4 or hxg5...} 33. g5 {R1xd6 will not work: there is no direct mate, so we open up a new front; first, get the g-pawn covered...} h4 34. f6 h3 35. f7 Rg6 {practically the only one...} 36. Rd1xd6 {but now, this will work real nice...} cxd6 37. Rc7+ Kb8 38. f8=Q+ Rxf8 39. Nxf8 Rxg5 40. Rh7 {Black is outplayed: he resigned...}
