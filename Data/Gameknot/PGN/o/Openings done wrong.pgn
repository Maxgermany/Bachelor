1. e4 {With recent real life events causing me to take a pretty long break from this site I've decided to come back for another crack at it; I'll try not to take on too much though in case I end up going through another 'chess rut' so to speak! Still, a chess game is a chess game and I'm just starting to fall in love with it again ;) this is my first completed game since returning and it worked out very well for me...} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {Standard Sicilian; nothing new here} e5 {The Pelikan (Lasker/Sveshnikov) variation, something I'm fairly unfamiliar with. I'm more used to either 5...a6 or 5...g6 in this position} 6. Ndb5 {Keeping the knight active and eyeing the d6 square. Mainline according to the Gameknot analyzer done after the game would be d6, preventing the knight from landing on that square. However it certainly didn't like Black's next move...} a6 {?! White's happy to move his knight!} 7. Nd6+ Bxd6 {Practically forced to prevent loss of castling rights} 8. Qxd6 {It remains nevertheless impossible for now for Black to castle; the White queen is in an excellent position} Qe7 {Logical enough; the queen is forced to act as no piece can defend it. If she were to retreat I could see no decent square for her in d3, d2 or d1 (which would in addition block bishops or delay the connecting of rooks) so that only left the exchange} 9. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {Strange to me at the time but then again, the black king isn't in that much danger with the queens exchanged off; in addition thanks to White's e4 pawn the e7 square is a horrid square for a knight!} 10. Bg5 {The pin was just irresistible really, especially with Nd5 on the cards! Even if the king retreats at this point I can still create doubled pawns and make it a very tasty target after Nd5, which is an outpost thanks to the lack of c-pawn from Black.} Nb4 {Aggressive, though the threat of the fork can be fixed with further development. It also provides protection to the d5 square.} 11. O-O-O b5 {Black's position is already pretty desperate so wanting to launch a quick attack on White is understandable, but the problem is White's own threats are more immediate! Instead 11...h6 12.Bxf6+ Kxf6 prevents the following assault from White, though he still gets to claim b6 with his knight after Nd5+} 12. a3 {The only defender of d5 is simple to displace!} Nc6 13. Nd5+ Kf8 {Forced; Ke6 or Ke8 loses out to Nc7+ winning the a8 rook whilst material is also lost with 13...Kd8 14.Nxf6 gxf6 15.Bxf6+   Kc6 loses a piece thanks to the discovered attack from the rook (Nxf6+)} 14. Nxf6 gxf6 15. Bxf6 Rg8 16. Rd6 {After the exchange and the gain of a pawn White chooses to cramp Black's position rather than win another pawn with Rd5, though I will admit I only saw the former at the time as it was both an excellent square for the rook (which couldn't be targeted) and restricted the light-square bishop. Right now Black's a8 rook is doing nothing whilst the other has no target. In addition the two minor pieces left can't move without further material being lost!} Rg6 {Pinning the bishop, though I've no desire to move it any time soon!} 17. g3 {The best way to free the bishop and get it into the action; its target is the d7 pawn} Ra7 {Protecting d7 in preparation for the bishop attack but analysing the position I found it to be so much more dangerous than first appeared!} 18. Bh3 {Black resigned at this point, but with good reason; the threat of 19.Bf5! was unavoidable (18...Nd4 is still bad after Bxe5) and Black would have to lose the exchange; for example Rg8 leaves it with no safe squares after Bxh7 and 18...Rh6 19.Be7+ Kg7 20.Bf8+ also won the exchange. I hope you enjoyed the annotation and the game - Will probably do more if more interesting games show up! }
