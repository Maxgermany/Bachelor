[White "GM Grischuk (2786)"]
[Black "GM Solak (2611)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 {So, white kicks things off with the usual.} c5 {This is the most common response from a GM.  And, Solak is no different.} 2. Nf3 {This is what you typically see in the Sicilian.  But, black's next move is going to be quite unusual, and there are no transpositions, either.} Nc6 {Normally, 2...d6 gets played.  3.d4, cxd4 4.Nxd4, Nf6 5.Nc3, a6.  Only later on, in the late opening does do we see ...Nc3.  So, this is quite unusual.  In fact, I'd say that this is now out of book.  That doesn't mean that this is weak or that it does not follow the basics, but you often don't see it, I don't believe that it has a name anymore.  } 3. Bb5 {It's possible that Grischuk wasn't familiar with this line, so he decided to play this move, as though it were a Ruy Lopez, even though it's nothing like that.  I got this idea from ION because in a different annotation he said, "He was intent upon the 1.e4 2.Nf3 3.Bb5 sequence almost regardless of what Black played. Back in schoolboy days, I liked the Queen's Gambit openings in which I would play 1.d4 2.c4. 3.Nc3 4.Nf3 5.Bg5. Then I encountered people playing the King's Indian (1...Nf6) and had no idea what to do against it. So I simply played the 5 move sequence I knew. It turned out to be a perfectly playable approach: I won quite a few games playing that!"   But, why would a grandmaster do that?  I thought that GM's were familiar with pretty much all of the different variaitons.} e6 {Based on what I mentioned on the last move, it's also possible that black thought that he'd play the same thing and play a move, as though it were something like a French Defense.  The problem is that you never really know what a GM is thinking.  In the mean time, white is about to exchange his B for black's N.  In this position, I believe that Grischuk is making the right choice because a N here is more dangerous and worth more then a B.} 4. Bxc6 bxc6 5. d3 {! Since white just exchanged his LSB, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this move.  In fact, it is developing and quite good.  And, I prefer this over 5.d4.  After 5.d4 there would have been exchange 5...cxd4, 6.Nxd4.  Normally, doubled pawns don't affect a game that much, or as cdeburca puts it, "There's more to chess then doubled chess."  But, when you talk about a GM's that's not usually the case.  Double pawns can directly make or break a game because doubled pawns as in this case are two bad pawns which should drastically affect the position later on.  Having said that, I think that white made a good and very smart decision to let black keep his doubled pawns, as opposed to, exchange.  In addition, with this move, white's DSB is already quite active and doing a lot, even though it hasn't moved yet.  Having said all of that, I think that white is better developed.} Ne7 {?! So, black decides to take an opportunity to catch up on development.  In my opinion, this move is quite inaccurate.  Better was 5...Bd6 where his bishop isn't crammed.  Plus he would then be able to play something else without any problems.  The problem here is that this move jams Solak's DSB.  Now, he'll have to waste time to get it out, so white now has a clear league in development.} 6. h4 {I don't know why Grischuk played this.  Afterall, he's not planning to bring his R out any time soon.  Instead, I simply would have continued to develop by bringing the b1 Knight or DSB out.  Or, most likely, in this position, I simply would have castled King side to get my K to safety.} Qc7 {On the other hand, unless there is an extenuating circumstance for doing so, I don't know why anyone especially a GM would their Q out, before everything else is developed.  Ok, I don't always go by every single guideline when it comes to development or General Openings because there are occasions where it's better not to.  But, the main thing that I follow is not bringing the Queen before the other pieces are developed.  Now, according to the master mater (easy19) sometimes really strong players can get away with deviating from normal openings.  But, that's when it's against a lower rated player.  That, however, is not the case against a GM.  For example, in her video of, "Beating Fischer's Record: Victory Over Anand", Judit Polgar punished Anand for failing to develop properly.  This actually led to his downfall.   With that said, I strongly believe that white can now punish black for ignoring this guideline.  It will be very interesting to see what happens, from here on in.} 7. h5 {But, I don't know what white is trying to accomplish here.  Perhaps, where looking at a passed pawn which wouldn't happen later on.  If so, black can stop this way before it ever happens with ...g6, or ...h6.} e5 {Now, this is a very good developing move, but I'd say that white still has an advantage.  That's because he's still slightly more developed and has better control over the center then black.  All he has to do is get the other pieces out, which should be easy to do and castle.} 8. Nbd2 {?!, but this is an inaccuracy for the same reason that 5...Ne7 was inaccurate.} f6 {WTH?  Why did black play this?  Better was 8...g7 so then he's be able to get his DSB out immediately.  Instead, I view this move as pointless and that there was no need or good reason for this.  This move should cause problems for Solak, once he decides to castle.  } 9. Nh4 {Again, I'm not sure why he'd move the same piece more then once, when he could have used another piece to develop.  Afterall, there were no threats, and none of white's pieces were attacked in any way.} g5 {At least, however, black is punishing white for this one.  Now, he just lost tempii, and white can now use this time to continue to develop.  Plus, it's now feasible for him to get his DSB out.  So far, there have been a lot of twists and turns, as far as, I'm concerned.} 10. Nhf3 d6 {Interesting.  I actually like it a lot, and since it involves a center, it is also a developing move.} 11. Nf1 {?! At first, I wasn't sure why Grischuk moved here.  But, what he will play next answers my question, as he'll find a good place to put his N.  However, I view this as a waste of time since he could have found a better place in one, as opposed to, three moves.  How?  Simple, all he had to play was 11.Nd4.} h6 {But, I don't know why this was played.} 12. Ne3 {At least, as noted earlier, white found a good place for his N and now has a strong Knight pair which is quite unusual.  Normally, you see a good bishop pair, but not a Knight pair, like this.} f5 {Right now, black intends and will soon exchange, but white will not allow that right away.} 13. g4 {Instead, he plays this first, for whatever reason.  He could have just taken, and you'd still wind up with an even exchange.  But, I guess this move gives more coverage and then has an equal amount of material as your opponent because I remember Jack Stockel advising me to count your number of pieces, and this is what he generally alludes to.  So, there has to be some mathematic logic to this that I don't quite understand.} fxg4 {However, black decides to take.} 14. Nh2 {But, Grischuk can't take back right away, as it would lose.  So, in other words, if instead 14.Nxg4??, 14...Bxg4, which not only loses a piece for a pawn, but creates a very nasty pin for white, in the aftermath.  So, instead, white is going to wait for be patient and wait for the opportunity to arrive.  I like his decision as I know that chess requires a lot of patience and thinking.  In fact, I remember about when I resorted to, "Unsound Agression".  But, although I disagreed, a lot of those commentators were right, especially in a very real sense.  That's because with unsound aggression, you're just being very impatient and getting aggressive early.  But, much later on, I looked at one watched a segment of the Alkehine Tournament with commentary from GM Judit Polgar.  In it, she stressed just how important it is to be patient.  Well, as the saying goes, "patience is of a virtue."} Bg7 {So, black now uses his opportunity to develop another piece, as noted earlier, with this fianchetto.  And now, it appears that black is ahead in development, but anything can change.  Actually, as you recall on the last move, I noted that white would wait and be patient before taking.  Guess what?  That's about to happen.  It's because, in this position, it's now feasible for white to get a pawn back without losing anything.  And, he's about to do this with 15.Nexg4.} 15. Nexg4 O-O {In the meantime, black decides to use his opportunity to castle.  I think that it's smart.  Not only does it tuck the monarch away, but it's another developing move and generally brings you one step closer to competing development.  How do I know this?  Well, in her video against Anand, Judit Polgar explained a moral and one thing which you learn from that video is that it's a good idea to, "complete development by castling", as she puts it.} 16. Be3 {At least, white decides to develop another piece.} Be6 {But, black's development is now complete.} 17. Qd2 {And, that's almost true for white.  The question is, which side will Grischuk castle?  We will find out soon.} Kh8 {I don't know why Solak played this.} 18. O-O-O {But, with this move, we can now say that white has also just completed his development.} Ng8 {Ok, I'm not sure what's running through black's mind here.} 19. c4 {But, white decides to do something before black can figure out a way to correct his doubled pawns.} Qe7 {And, for whatever reason, black decides to put pressure on the e file.  This time, that plan is not going work because white's pieces are just as coordinated as black's.} 20. Qe2 {And, this is how white foils black's plan.} d5 {In this position, black wants to exchange pawns with white.} 21. Bd2 {I don't know why Grischuk played this, instead of just taking right away.  But, now the exchange is about to ensue.} dxc4 22. dxc4 Qf7 {?!  At this point, black wants to force another exchange.  In my mind, however, this is just a waste of time because material is even and how will exchanging benefit anyone's position?} 23. Bc3 {But, I like white's intention.  The idea is to try and win a pawn.  Of course, however, there are ways to stop this with something like 23...Qf4+.  Instead, however, Solak is about to win a pawn by attacking white's Q.} Bxc4 24. Qe3 Rae8 {So, black, "throws in the towel", by putting pressure on the e file.  This time, however, I like the way Solak does it.} 25. b3 {But, white finds a way around this by attacking black's LSB.  } Bb5 {Of course, black easily gets out of it.} 26. Rd6 {? Therefore, white takes advantage of the opportunity to put pressure on the sixth rank.  Unfortunately, this is a mistake as black is going to win another free pawn, after 26...Qxh5.} Qxh5 27. Rg1 {I do not know why white played this.} Qf7 {? But, black decides to use this opportunity to put pressure on the f file.  Unfortunately, this enables white to get back a pawn after 28.Qxc5, and that is why I see this move as a mistake.} 28. Qxc5 Qf4+ {Now, black renders in another check.} 29. Kb2 {?? And, white gets out of it.  However, I think that better was 29.Bd2.  I generally like to get out of check by attacking something, if possible because it makes me less nervous, and sometimes, prevents me from getting nervous in the first place.  By doing things this way, it would produce a, "Fight or Flight", syndrome for me.  } h5 {So, Solak goes for it by attacking white's N.} 30. Rh1 {?? This is a blunder.  Now, black should win a piece with 20...hxg4.  Lucky for white, however, black misses this opportunity and takes white's pawn instead with 30...Qxe4.} Qxe4 31. f3 {?! So, white now decides to attack's black's Q.  But, this time it's pointless as Solak can just retreat.} Qf4 {I don't know what black is trying to accomplish here.} 32. a4 {But, I absolutely like this move.  That's because it places a lot of pressure on black, as he now has to struggle to defend his B.} Be2 {32...Ba6 was also an option, for some reason, I like this move better.} 33. Rg6 {Now, white decides to put pressure on the g file, and in a very interesting way.} Nf6 {But, black decides to get even by attacking white's N.  Unfortunately, this is not going to work because white is now going to get a pawn back after 34.Nxe5.} 34. Nxe5 Kh7 {I don't know why black played this.  Afterall, Solak is not going to win whites R here because of Grischuk's e5 N.} 35. Nhg4 {Very interesting.  At this point, white now decides to threaten mate in an unusual way, as we will see later on.} Bxf3 {?? So, black decides to take.  Unfortunately, this is Solak's losing blunder because of what's about to unfold.  } 36. Rxg7+ {So, white takes, and mate is inevitable from here on in.  In fact, this time it's safe to say that mate is soon to follow because it's almost clear on how this will happen.} Kxg7 {Black takes.  Another option which was slightly better would have been 36...Kh8, as it avoids, but then comes the immediate family fork, 37.Ng6+ winning white's Q.  Well, Solak does not want to chance so he takes back, what he doesn't realize is this move will lead to his downfall even sooner.} 37. Qxa7+ {And, that's because of this move.  Now, in this position, black's only options are 37...Ng8, or 37...Nh8.  Both of which lead to an unusal mating net in two.  Black sees this, and therefore, resigns.  One moral to this story is that you have to be careful where you place your pieces.  Had Solak taken advantage of white's mistake of 30.Rh1?? with 30...hxg4 he would probably would have won.  And, this unusual mating net would not have been feasible.}
