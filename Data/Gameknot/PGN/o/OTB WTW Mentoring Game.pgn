[Opening "Hungarian defence (C50)"]

1. e4 {So, I start off with my normal.} e5 {As does Stanley.  And, I know how he continues and it usually ends up the way it will as white, so I'm ready to go into the Italian Opening.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Be7 {But, once you get to that point, so by the 4th game, the move often changes.  As with other games, I asked myself what Stanley play next.  I know that this was played to develop, but I don't know why he didn't move the B to somewherelse like f6 or c5.  As those appear to be stronger squares then where it's placed, now.} 4. O-O {With that being said, I waste no time in castling.  It's worth noting that even though it's completely, I'm treating it, as if, it were the Ruy Lopez, so we know how it starts.  But, then, after 3.Bb5 I'm handling like I would if black plays 3...a6, and then after 4.Ba4 Nf6, 5.0-0 is the most common move as I was once told.  And, the reason behind treating two different openings alike is because my idea of a good time is castling, ASAP which I'm sometimes guilty of not doing.} Nf6 {I was not surprised to see Stanley play this.} 5. Ng5 {But, Jack implied that when that occurs, and you have the B on c4, this is the most common move.  Of course, the reason is wrong since he said that black has no way to avoid losing the R since white will take fork on f7 with the Ng5.  But, I knew that there's a way for black to prevent, so I questioned it in an annotation.  And, despite that, nuntar said that threatening the f7 pawn with Ng5 is still a very good move.} O-O {With that being said, I had expected 5...d5 which is how most of my opponents have answered.  But, I like this move even better as we think alike.  It shows that, in general, the sooner you castle, the better.} 6. d3 {?! Meanwhile, I prepare to develop my Bc1.  But, better was to fianchetto with 6.b3  I was a little too cautious because I thought that Ken once implied that I should be careful about fianchettoing when he said that in the KID, it's not wise to double fianchetto.  But, first, that's a completely different defense.  Second, my LSB wasn't fianchettoed since it started as a well known opening which doesn't have white fianchettoing.  But, had I played 6.b3, if black were to attack now, I could've pulled back to d3 or e2.  By playing this, I'm forced to exchange my B for N.  And, my Bc4 is stronger since from what Stanley does next, I figure out that this was an open position. } Na5 7. Nd2 {Preparing for that, I use my N, as right now, I was happy and, at first, felt that exchanging my B was the wrong choice.  Since after 7...Nxc7 I thought that 8.Nxc4, as opposed to 8.dxc4 brings my N to an even stronger place then my B was on that square.  But, my assessment was incorrect here.} Nxc4 8. Nxc4 d6 {This is proof of why, and I thought nothing of this move.  All I thought was ok, Stanley's trying to catch up on his development by preparing his Bd1.} 9. Be3 {And, my thought is that I'm ahead of my game since my development is complete.  Yes, I knew that Stanley's would be on his next move, but there's something about his Bc1 that will become quite dangerous. } Bg4 {Stanley starts by attacking my Q.} 10. f3 {Not seeing the point to his attack, and viewing it as a waste of time, I fire back.  But, Stanley has a plan which I'm about to overlook.} Bd7 11. d4 {?? I decide that now is the time to exchange pawns.  Of course, I don't exchange pieces just because it's possible, but my attitude is a little different with pawns.  Once I'm ready to, I exchange pawns.  But, I forgot what Ken said.  Earlier, Kenneth_fiore_3 said that when it comes to not exchanging so readily, he was, specifically, alluding to pieces and not pawns which is when I first discovered that Coach Stockel isn't always right.  However, Ken later advised about not exchanging pawns so early in the exact same comment in one of my annotations.  Well, this is when common sense knocked into me, and I treat pawns more like pieces when it comes to exchanging, although now was the time to do it but differently.  I'm, extremely, picky about when to exchange pieces, but nowadays, I don't exchange pawns, unless I feel that there's, at least, a somewhat valid reason like breaking through in the center.  Having said that, this was not the time to exchange, as now, Stanley will break through in the center since this is a center pawn.  I mentioned that I'm forced, so best was 11.f4, and if black is to attack my Ng5 later on, I would be able to retreat on f3.  } exd4 12. Qxd4 h6 {Having said that, Stanley tries to take advantage by attacking my N, and when I retreat, my K will be, completely exposed.  What I didn't realize is that defending means that I have to exchange in such a way that my K side pawn structures are destroyed.  So, at this point, I felt that I was already lost but am, nowhere near ready to resign because something can still pop up, even with an exposed K.} 13. Nh3 Bxh3 14. gxh3 c5 {Thus, Stanley goes on the offense against my K.} 15. Qc3 d5 {And, Stanley continues going for it by forcing an exchange of pawns.  As that's the only way for me to avoid exchanging N's, which I'm not ready to do yet, either.} 16. exd5 Nxd5 17. Qe5 {Meanwhile, I do what I can to prevent further damage, but it's already too little, too late.  I'll continue being attacked, until Stanley is able to win a piece without compensation.  } Bf6 18. Qe4 Re8 19. Qd3 Nxe3 20. Qxd8 {Thinking that this ended all troubles, I exchanged Q's.  But, Stanley is still going to win a piece.  I, at first, thought that better was to retake, right away.  However, 20.Nxe3, first, wouldn't have helped, as Stanley would forced the exchange of Q's on d2 before playing this move.  And, this is where I know for sure, that white is lost.  Against someone of my strength, I wouldn't know since I've compensated before, like in my last tournament game.  But, against Class B players and above, once you've lost a piece, there's, generally speaking, no going back.  As they won't let you get anything back, and it's certainly so here.} Raxd8 21. Nxe3 Rxe3 22. Rab1 {Knowing what I've lost, I decide to protect the pawn that's being attacked by B.} Rd2 {But, it won't do, as Stanley has plans against my K.  I didn't realize what he'd accomplish until the very end.  However, it should've rang a bell to me much earlier as it's similar to how easy19 had a mating sequence in our very last game which was a different WTW game, called, "All your base belongs to us".} 23. c4 {Just figuring that c2 was attacked, I advance it, but this wasn't necessary, as there's a bigger picture.  And, I say that because of what bhidragon said in my last game against him of seeing the, overall, picture.  In this case, it was mate which I overlooked.  But, had I seen it, I would still be lost as I'd be forced to give up, at least, another two pawns.} Ree2 24. Rfc1 {Trying to prevent 24...Rc2, but there were much bigger concerns which is what's happening right now, being the threat. } Reg2+ 25. Kh1 Bd4 {It didn't occur to me, until this very move which is why I brought my R to e1 on my next move.  I was thinking that if Stanley plays 26...Rg1+??, I have an easy answer for that which would, of course, be 27.Rxg1  My anticipation was that Stanley would play 27...Bxg1, and after 28.Kxg1, I'd be well into the game.  In fact, I forgot that if true, I'd be the one with more then a small advantage, as later on, I'd answer with Re8!  But, I was way too optimistic, as I should've been aware of 26...Rxh2# where he mated me.} 26. Rce1 Rgxh2# {I forgot what Stanley said, when I asked him where I went wrong.  But, I believe he told me that letting him exchange on h3 where my K became exposed.  If so, he was alluding to 11.d4 which is how it started.  And, it was just me being too readisome to exchange pawns, which I've also done before.  That's where I learned that it's not just pieces, but one shouldn't exchange possible without a reason to do so, just because it's possible, either.  More important, I should've played 11.f4 which would still exchange pawns.  But, it would also leave another option for my N to retreat, where I wouldn't have been forced to exchange it.  In effect, my K would not have gotten exposed, and I wouldn't have been mated since that's what ruined my K side pawn structures.}
