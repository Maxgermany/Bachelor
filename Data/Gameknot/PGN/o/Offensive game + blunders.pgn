[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {Both myself (Black) and white are offensive players. White hasn't played for about five years, but still has some good game in him and gives me a good run for my money. We both make a couple serious blunders and the game goes the distance. We played the game in one night over about four hours of chatting and playing.} Nf6 2. g3 c5 {A bit of a gamble for me. I'm hoping he'll take the pawn, so I can go e5.} 3. c3 {He doesn't go for it.} d5 4. Bh3 c4 5. Qa4+ {Brave!} Nc6 6. b4 cxb3 e.p. {Poor guy doesn't know about this obscure rule, so it catches him completely by surprise. Honestly I only did the move because I knew it would freak him out, not because it gained me in any way. He's still complaining to me about my "hacks" on this move.} 7. axb3 Ne4 8. Nd2 {Bad move. Leaves the c3 pawn undefended, opens it up for a fork.} Nxc3 9. Qa3 Nxd4 {Moving in for the c2 fork.} 10. Qc5 {He effectively blocks the c2 fork.} Nc2+ {I do it anyways, I have a backup plan.} 11. Kf1 d4 {Nicely tied up. Only trouble is, it gives up the pawn on a7.} 12. Rxa7 {This guy's really good at pulling unexpected moves on me. I had to think it through a bit. Although, while this wins the pawn, it ends up losing the rook...} e6 {... because of a discovered queen attack. (e5 is bad, due to the Bishop on h3.)} 13. Qc4 Rxa7 {Yum yum.} 14. Ngf3 Ra1 {Forces Kg2.} 15. Kg2 Qd5 {My intention here is to offer a queen trade, but I forgot about the Bishop. Shit! Blunder number 2.} 16. Qxc8+ Qd8 17. Qxb7 Ba3 {This forces a bishop trade.} 18. Qc6+ {Delaying the inevitable.} Qd7 19. Qxd7+ {He finally goes for a fair trade.} Kxd7 20. Bxa3 Rxa3 21. Ne1 {Knight trade! Good shit.} Nxe1+ 22. Rxe1 f5 23. e3 Ra2 24. Nc4 Ne4 25. exd4 {He made this move and then said "Crap!"} Rxf2+ {It turns out an even trade, even if I'm out of offensive options I'm all up in his face now.} 26. Kg1 Rb8 {Time to grab some pawns.} 27. Ne5+ Kd6 28. Bg2 {Ganging up on the Knight.} Rd2 {I'm cool with a trade if it lets me pick up a pawn.} 29. Nf3 {He's not into it.} Rb2 30. Bf1 Rb8xb3 31. Re2 Rxf3 {Crap! Another blunder. This wipes out all of the lead I had in this game.} 32. Rxb2 Kd5 33. Rb4 Nd2 {Another blunder! Crap crap! I was expecting Be2 but...} 34. Bg2 {I didn't realize during my analysis that Bg2 would pin the Rook.} g5 {Figuring I'm in for a Bishop/Rook trade, I advance pawns in preparation for a pawn attack.} 35. h4 {Odd... speaking with him later he didn't realize that the rook is so much more valuable than the Bishop in the end game.} g4 36. h5 Ke4 {GAMBLE. His next move is Rb7, capturing the h7 pawn. My gamble is that I will find a mating solution that involves his rook being on the other side of the board, before he promotes a pawn.} 37. Rb7 {He seems to be going for it...} h6 38. Re7 Kxd4 {Yum yum.} 39. Rxe6 Rxg3 40. Kf2 {Damn! He caught on to my trap. He doesn't go for the h6 pawn, suspicious of me closing in on his King.} f4 41. Re2 Kd3 42. Ke1 f3 {KNIGHT SACRIFICE!} 43. Rxd2+ {He goes for it. According to my game analysis, at this point, all routes lead to mate for Black, barring any move I missed. And still the game goes another 18 moves...} Ke3 44. Bf1 {I was hoping for Bh1 Rg1#, oh well.} Rg1 45. Rf2 g3 46. Re2+ Kf4 {As pointed out by a commenter, if I take the rook, it ends in stalemate.} 47. Re6 f2+ {Methodically shoving my pawns down his throat.} 48. Ke2 g2 {He has a choice between capturing the pawn and capturing the other pawn.} 49. Bxg2 {He wouldn't have gotten off much better with Kxf2 gxf1=Q+.} Rxg2 50. Kd3 {I have no idea why he didn't take the pawn. If he had then it would have been a struggle to get his King away so I could promote.} f1=Q+ 51. Kd4 Kg5 {Prevent any funny business with pawn capturing and trying to promote.} 52. Rg6+ Kxh5 53. Rxh6+ {His logic: at least I wouldn't be able to capture the pawn.} Kxh6 {I don't know why, but from this point he actually made me go through with the mate rather than resign. He's a fighter, he never gives up until it's over.} 54. Ke5 Rg5+ 55. Ke4 Qc4+ 56. Ke3 {No Kf3?} Rg3+ 57. Kd2 Qc3+ 58. Ke2 Rg2+ 59. Kf1 Qf3+ 60. Ke1 Qe2# {Good game.}
