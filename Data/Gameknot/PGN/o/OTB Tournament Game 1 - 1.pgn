[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {Unlike Carl, Tom doesn't generally change openings, although he did here.  Although, I guess he wanted to experiment this way.} d5 {Of course, I knew what to do about that, and was prepared to face the QG.} 2. e3 {But, he does something else.  I assume that Tom's going for the Colle's Franketort System.} Nf6 {And, I was prepared for that.  My attitude is that if Tom wants to do it, let him.  As this is the most common response to such.} 3. Nc3 {But, Tom answered with the other N, instead.  If I ION didn't mention that it, sometimes works, I would've given this as an inaccuracy.  That is, since a certain someone said that it's not a good idea to block the c file with your N in 1.d4 openings.  And, others have verified that, but ION told me that are certain settings where it works.  Plus, blocking the c pawn, otherwise, in the same openings, isn't all that bad.  Yet, I'm now trying to figure out a way to punish Tom for this.} e6 {And, with that, I prepare to pin his Nc3 which will turn out to be not useful.} 4. h3 {Concerned about 4.Ng4, which I wasn't going to play, anyhow due to his Q.  My next move was the plan, but I'm the one that's about to be punished since he'll break in an aggressive form, causing me to lose time.} Bb4 5. a3 Bd6 {I also could've retreated with 6.Bb6.  I had thoughts of that, originally thinking that 6...b4 would expose the K due to a limited amount of Ghost Vision.  But, that would be so if we were on the other side, and upon realizing it, I realized that pushing that b pawn would help him out and give him further tempo.  Well, I was not going to let that happen. } 6. Nf3 {Meanwhile, Tom continues developing and threatens an eventual 7.Ng5 which I stop on my next move.} a6 7. Ne5 {Wanting me to exchange and trying to tie my Nf6 down by threatening 8.Qf3.  Although, I only recently found out that a move like that wouldn't be a major threat.} O-O {But, not knowing it then, I put a stop to it by castling, at once.} 8. Bd3 {Likewise, Tom's preparing to do the same thing.  But, I believe that he's doing this in an aggressive manner.  In fact, I'm thinking about what he might be, in the long run, trying to do with his B and Q.  For example, Qf3-g3, at some point.  So, not wanting to take any chances with that, I exchange, although looking at it, this was premature to do so.  I should've held off and realized that the Q isn't out the B's not a threat, anytime soon.  Better would've been 8...c6 or 8...Bd7, where I try to provoke Tom into exchange my LSB since that's the bad Bishop.} Bxe5 9. dxe5 Nfd7 10. Bxh7+ {?? I was surprised to Tom play this.  I realize what he was thinking which is a B sac to expose my K.  But, I kept in mind that it doesn't work, unless, of course, I blunder which is bound to happen.  However, this will leave me a piece for pawn up.} Kxh7 11. Qh5+ {I have an easy answer to this, as well, and similar to with Kenneth_fiore_3, I'm feeling more then a little happy and comfortable with my position.} Kg8 12. O-O {Meanwhile, Tom castles, and I'm going after his Q.  I'm thinking about what else I can do, here.  And, I realize that doing so allows me to win another pawn, leaving me the equivalent to an entire piece ahead.} g6 13. Qe2 Nxe5 14. e4 {Going after my pawn.  Of course, I could exchange it, but then, I'd lose tempo, if Tom were to recapture with his Q.  So, I decide to attack his Nc3, instead.} d4 15. Bf4 {And, Tom goes after my N, which makes me happy since I'm extremely happy with liquidating.} dxc3 16. Bxe5 cxb2 {In fact, I figured that I had a win here, until I saw Tom's Be5 which was right after this capture.} 17. Bxb2 Bd7 {In the meantime, I decide to develop another piece.  Of course, the reason for my ignoring my Nb8 is due to the fact that my c pawn hasn't advanced, yet.  But, Tom goes for a pin since I was threatening to skewer with 18...Bb5  But, I would've overlooked, and what's more is that I view this pin as a waste of time since white could then block with 19.c4.  Having said that, Tom's next move is of no concern to me.} 18. Rfd1 Bb5 {As I attempt to liquidate Q's.  Of course, white sees it and puts a stop to that.  In response, I also protect my Q.} 19. Qg4 Qe7 20. Qg3 {I don't know why Tom played this until a move later since he's threatening mate which has no effect, won't work on, me.} Rd8 {Later on, I figure what he's doing, but I don't care since I felt that his threats favor me, this time around.} 21. Qe5 {The reason is due to the fact that I'll liquidate which will enable me to attack his Q.} Rxd1+ 22. Rxd1 f6 23. Qf4 {I actually thought that Tom had nothing left against me, but I was wrong.} g5 {But, with me thinking that way, I go on the offense, again, as now, despite my c pawn not being advanced, yet, I decide to use the tempo to complete my development.} 24. Qg4 Nc6 25. Qh5 {Of course, I know that Tom intends to do something with his Q which I try to stop on my next move by trying to liquidate.  But, he, wisely, doesn't budge.} Qf7 26. Qh6 {Instead, Tom thing thinks that mate, is threatened.  But, I kept in mind that it isn't, due to my f6 pawn.} Rd8 {?? So, I try to further liquidate which will work right away.  However, I overlooked one move that will allow Tom to win back a pawn, and in the process, he'll win more.  In fact, while it's not obvious, I think that this was the losing move.  So, best was 26...e5.} 27. Rxd8+ Nxd8 28. Bxf6 {The reason being is that, without this pawn, g5 and my Nd8 will fall, and now, my K is completely exposed.  So, I suddenly go from winning to losing in just 2 moves.} Qh7 {Trying to further liquidate, but it won't work.  As Tom takes advantage of my previous mistake to win, yet another pawn and piece which puts him ahead, now.} 29. Qxg5+ Kf8 30. Bxd8 Qd7 {Doing what I can for counterplay in hopes that Tom goes wrong, I attack, again.  And, Tom defends in a very interesting way, by placing me in check which will, yet another pawn.} 31. Qf4+ Ke8 32. Bxc7 {At first I didn't think so, but I figured upon seeing that his Q protects the same diagonal.} Qd1+ {Doing what I can for counterplay and trying to come with a method to, perhaps, trick him into a draw by repetition, I, immediately, throw in a check.  Once I figure out that it isn't possible, I then grab on c2, in hopes that he'll get stressed out and start making blunders which would allow me to pull a swindle.  In fact, that's how Carl won a couple of tournament games against me in an, otherwise, lost position.} 33. Kh2 Qxc2 34. Bb6 {I don't know why Tom played this.} Qb3 {But, figuring that it was pointless, I go right after his a pawn.} 35. Qb8+ {But, I overlooked this move which will allow him to win back a pawn.  Then, I play Hope Chess and attempt to trick into a draw by repetition.} Kf7 36. Qxb7+ Kf8 37. Qa8+ Kf7 38. Qa7+ {Which, of course, fails, but had he played 38.Qb7+, I would've announced it.} Kf8 39. Bc5+ {But, Tom is determined not to let me pull a swindle.} Kg8 40. Qe7 {Threatening mate which I'm about to stop, for now.} Qc4 41. Qg5+ {And, once Tom played this, I, again, attempt to get a draw by rep.} Kh8 42. Qh6+ Kg8 43. Qg5+ Kh8 44. Qf6+ {Which, similar to before, would've worked, if he had played 44.Qh6+  So, I've reached the conclusion that this player knows what would lead to it.  As Carl would've missed it, and this would be a draw since I was able to announce it, once or twice, in hopelessly lost positions.  Be it note that this attempt was also me running low on time.  I only had about 10 minutes remaining, but Tom had about 25, however.} Kg8 45. Qg5+ Kh8 46. Bf8 {I was hoping that Tom would either play 44.Qf6 or 44.Qh6, as then, I'd announce since the position would've repeated.  But, after this move, I looked at the board and realized that even if I'm about to prevent mate, Tom has some unstoppable passed pawn.  That on top of how little time I have was the reason that I resigned here.  Even if I could hold on, this is the only time where I knew for sure how many minutes left.  And, I was down to only 8 minutes, whereas, Tom had 23.  There was no way that I could avoid losing on time since it, generally, takes me a while to find a good move.  And, with that, I caved in.  Master Nathan Resika then analyzed this game a little and thought that I went wrong by missing an exchange.  I'm not sure what move he was alluding to.  But then, Jack emphasized something that I kept in mind during the last tournament game.  "I always tell you that when you're ahead, that's when you need to be very careful" which was, certainly, the case here.  After this game, however, I played in, so far, 2 more tournament games and have won, both.  This is a very interesting match that remains to be seen, what will happen, at the end of this tournament.}
