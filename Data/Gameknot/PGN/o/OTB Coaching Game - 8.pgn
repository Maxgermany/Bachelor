1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Whenever I'm against Jack as white, I often play the Ruy Lopez.} Nf6 {?! To continue development.  But, do you remember my most recent game against archduke_piccolo that I annotated a couple of days ago.  One of the main lessons was to deviate from the guidelines.  In this particular position, I'd say that Jack should've done that which is why I view this move as an inaccuracy.  Instead, best was 3...Ne7  Even though the N is a big crammed it prevents doubled pawns.  Now, normally, I wouldn't go into as much details because as someone, but I forgot who said, it wasn't that big of a deal.  However, continuing the course with GM Susan Polgar, basic strategy and planning was discussed.  One of the things she outlined was healthier pawn structure.  By playing this, I get a small edge because I take, and when Jack takes back he winds up with doubled pawns, which I don't have.  Therefore, I applied something that I learned from that course, for this game.  Had he retreated the N back to e7, this would not happen, and it would still be even.  } 4. Bxc6 bxc6 5. O-O {The idea is, as we put it, to go home.  However, Mr. Stockel was surprised that I did not take and said that I could've won a pawn, had I played 5.Nxe5.  So, I looked it over, and realize that this would not have happened because if 5.Nxe5, 5...Nxe5 and this is an exchange which I don't like as well.  Although common, I had a bad exerience with that which I won't forget.} d6 {Now worried about the e pawn, he adds a defender.  However, this wasn't needed because, as noted, I wouldn't have gotten a free pawn, regardless.} 6. Nc3 {To continue development, and unlike the previous game, right now, I don't have to deviate.  That's because it's also important to know when to do so, as noted towards the end of the other annotation.} Be7 {His idea isn't just development, but this also allows him to castle K side, later on.} 7. d4 {A little was early exchanges.  That, was, until I recently learned something, and C++ is spot on.  The idea behind exchange early and often is to receive points and get a draw against stronger players.  But, my idea isn't really about points, but rather, learning and improving from that.  So, exchanges are not always what one should keep in mind.  But, this game happened last Friday.  Therefore, I told Jack which I based on his advice for games against Tom, that I like to exchange early and often.  So, he said, "You like early exchanges?  If you like early exchanges, why not?"} exd4 8. Nxd4 {I had two choices, of how to take.  But, even though guidelines don't apply, I do not enjoy bringing my Q out prematurely because of what happened against him, a while ago.  In that game, I was completely development, so once that happened, I brought my Q out.  However, he said then that the costly blunder was still bringing the Q out too soon and that one should wait, until you absolutely must bring the Q into play.  With that being said, I took with the N.} O-O {He said, "Why don't I go home first."} 9. Bg5 {No dispute there, but it is now safe to complete development.  I told him that this is why I played Bg5  He said, "It's ok, it's interesting."  And, I bared in mind that it's when and when not to follow guidelines since I deviated by taking to avoid the loss of material, yet I was able to go back to them later on. } d5 {He wants my pawn.  On a normal basis, I would take on f6 because, first, back in the day, I always thought that N was worth more then a B since it's not an endgame.  But, then after a studying another helpful article by GM Dan Heisman, which cplusplus11, I realized that this isn't so.  And, with black's structure and placement combined to where the DSB and what danger it poses, the B is more dangerous then the N.  Second, why exchange, when I can get a pawn.  Note: It is free, since the Q is attacked.} 10. Nxc6 Qd7 11. Nxe7+ {Now that I'm up a pawn, the idea is liquidation because it's good to exchange pieces when ahead.  However, we are also coming to the point where I sort of, forgot what was played.} Qxe7 12. Nxd5 Qxe4 {At this point, he did what you typically see with a GM.  Particularly, Judit Polgar, and a certain player who I won't mention.  But, this is where Jack teaches like a GM, as those quizzes are, in fact, HW.  In addition, he provides variations which you often see with archduke_piccolo and grandmasters.  This is also, in part, where Jack's teaching style is similar to ION's teaching style and how it all blends in with my style of learning.  So, the question is how can white win a piece, in this position?  Now, this wasn't played, but rather it was 12...Qg6 to prevent the win of material in the game.  Although not possible in this position, that's how it was really played which is why I don't remember exactly what was played.  Worth noting that in part, my writing was a bit sloppy because the game started after 11:20 am, so I did not have much more then 30 minutes to play this.  Therefore, I was in a rush to record because of what was mentioned in the jkarp campaign.} 13. Be3 {Solution: 13.Bxf6  And, if 13...gxf6??, 14.Nxf6 forking the Q and K.  Not only does this win the Q, but blacks K would be very exposed, as well.  Of course, Jack was not going to allow that.} Re8 {?? So, he puts pressure right on the center, which is generally a good idea as that's one way to control it.  But, in this position, it is a blunder because of my next move.} 14. Nxc7 {Winning another pawn and forking both R's.} Bg4 {Of course, he has ways out of it.  Not only is the R no longer free, but I can't take because of this.  And, this time, the position is very similar to the actual game.  } 15. Qd5 {Still focused on getting the R for N.  I also considered 15.f3 but realized that this isn't good.  It looks so, when the Q and B appear to be forked, but the Q was en-prise due to the B, so 15.f3?? would've lost a Q for B.  My focus was, if worse came to worse, exchanging, but really to grab the R.  And, after I played this, Jack asked, "What are you attacking"?  I told him the Q's, and R. } Be6 {He said that this was his only move.  I know why, as considered and almost played 15...Re5, but after which I liquidate Q's and keep the advantage since I'm ahead.  The idea was also what I learned from Susan of improving your position, and exchanging would do that.  But, Jack does not allow this because of what he said and played.} 16. Qd2 {At first, I played 16.Qc6.  Now, even if not exact here, it's what happened in the game.  So, he said, "Can't attack Q.  What if I play 16...Nxf6, I can defend my R's."  Yes, he could, so best as we studied is this move, and now, the R's are still attacked.} Bh3 {Now, Jack gave me quiz by playing this.  In it he asked, "What must you do?", which is the same question to the previous quiz I showed at KOH chess club with taking a quiz.  Now, while in this position, you could take, in the actual game, taking was not an option because the g pawn was directly.  The Q was on, I believe, Qg6 when we played.  Initially, I played, I played 17.Qd5 going for an exchange.  But, I overlooked the N, and he said, "See if you can find a better.  Don't lose a R."  As it turns out, I would've lost my Q, if I'd played this because of his N.  This time, I could not find the solution because, somehow, the Q was moved to d1, but the Q, as he pointed out, was originally on d2.  With that being said the solution was 17.g3  In this position, it actually mates, so I recorded something similar of 17.f3, which in the actual game, it would've mated.  Then, Jack accurately said, "And, that still leaves the R's attacked."} 17. f3 Rad8 {After that, he said, "Well, let's get things started."} 18. Nxe8 {Now, I take advantage of my opportunity to grab his R.} Rxe8 {He said, "So, I capture your N."} 19. Rae1 {Now, in the actual game, it wasn't possible to take the Q for the reasons noted earlier.  My goal was to put pressure on the center.  Plus the R is right behind the Q which is known to strengthen your position.  I think, that better, however, was 19.Rad1 which also puts pressure.  I know because I studied GM games.  It included one from Judit Polgar against Anand which she won, as well as, several from GAC, and both put their Q's right in front of a R or R behind the Q.  Those two added extra pressure, and by doing so, they got an advantage which eventually became overwhelming.  The only reason I didn't do this is because Jack has said that it's a bad idea to place both your R's on the same color because a B on that color can, in general, fork both R's.  And, he gave an example.  But, that does not apply here because of the f pawn.  After this, I don't remember what was played afterwards, as I experimented with a messed up position that was totally different then what happened in our game.  So, I had to stop right here.  In the end, however, it does not matter because the game does not last much longer.  To be exact the game lasted for 24 moves, which is only 5 more from where I stopped.  After that, it timed out, so there was no time to finish the game, at all.  Therefore, it was recorded as unfinished, and what that also means is that it was in progress when we ended since I had to leave, at that point, and Jack was really focusing on a different game and would stay there until finished with Bert against Tom and how Bert won.  So, between that, and I having to leave, after the 24th move, we called it a day.}
