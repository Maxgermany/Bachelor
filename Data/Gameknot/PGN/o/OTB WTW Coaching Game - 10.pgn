[Opening "Sicilian (B54), Prins (Moscow) variation"]

1. e4 {As usual, I open with the Kings Pawn Opening.} c5 {Of course, he responds with the Siclian Defense.} 2. Nf3 {And, I go into the Open Variation.  Now, everything will remain standard, until move 5.} d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Bc4 {? At this point, I am only interested in getting my pieces out and castling ASAP.   However, I forgot the main line.  That's because I have lately been playing against the Ruy Lopez Opening, not the Siclian.  So, this is basically how it happens.  As we all know, I am familiar with both the Ruy Lopez and Siclian, but it's about getting used to something that you are not accustomed to.  For instance, I was used to playing against 1...e5 opening because I recently played against this, less then a week ago.  On the contrary, it was about two weeks since I played against 1...c5.  Those this makes you susceptible to that mistake.  The only problem, however, is that this flaw costs me a pawn.  And, unlike my usual games against him, there will be no going back, this time.} Nxe4 {That's because I told him, Oh my gosh!  I can't believe that I missed it.  I am used to the Open Siclian, and I have not made that mistake in a long time.  In addition, there are times where I can undo my mistake against this coach, but not this time.  That's because he said, "It's too late.  You gave me that pawn." } 6. O-O {In the meantime, I decide to castle.} a6 {As usual, this is what he plays.  Afterall, you often see 6...a6 in the Sicilian, that's called the Siclian Nadjorf.  I know because this is the defense that I generally play.} 7. Be3 {In the meantime, I am determined to continue developing.} Nf6 {?! At this point, I want to bring my other N out.  My opponent sees this and responds with this move.  The reason being that I am going to play 8.Nc3 in order to complete development.  When this happens, his N would get attacked.  However, that is not a good reason for moving here, so I view this as his first inaccuracy.  With this move, Mr. Stockel just wasted tempo, when he could have spent the time to develop.  Better was 7...d5 which also protects his piece and attacks my LSB.  In addition, I would not be able to capture the d5 pawn due to his N and Q.  Therefore, it would have benefited Jack and given him tempo.} 8. Nc3 e5 {Meanwhile, he decides to attack my N.  This time, however, I have a safe place to retreat it, so I do not mind.   } 9. Nf3 Nc6 {Of course, he decides to continue with development.} 10. Ng5 {! But, I have plans, instead.  That's right, for a first time in a while, I go for cheapo tactics.  Overall, I don't have a lot to lose, since I blundered away a pawn.  In this position, I am only determined to get back a pawn.  Afterall, as I already know, one pawn is usually enough to make the difference between win and loss in an endgame.  And, my opponent said, "Very good move" which is why I marked with an exclamation point, as opposed to, critisizing it.  He saw what I was trying to do.  In a normal game, this would count as unsound aggression, but not against Jack.  In fact, he deliberately allowed me to attack it, and this is a test that I just passed with flying color.  About two months ago, I spoke to him about unsound aggression, based on what the commentators told me.  He said that although it is a cheapo, "it's still an idea".  It's always good to come up with ideas in chess, as it proves that you are thinking ahead, and not just move by move.  In fact, that's why I, "took unsound aggression to be a good thing", as cdeburca criticized me for in a different annotation.  In this case, however, my plan will work, and I will essentially gain back what was lost, and then some.  His right to castle will be revoked.  On the other hand, I do agree, in some respects, not to make it into too much of a habitat because as inadowman said repeadetly in other annotations the threat is too obvious and easy to drive off.} Be7 {?? I understand that he wanted to continue with development, but this is his first blunder.  And, it's quite serious.  Either way, he has to give up his f pawn.  In this position, black should have moved his Q to the 7th rank, and that would have made 10.Ng5 pointless by preventing my next move.} 11. Bxf7+ {After I took with the bishop, he said, "You could have taken with the N, instead.  Then, you would have won the R."  This time, however, I disagree with his assessment, and I cannot go by what Jack says.  I have to base it on the position.  If 11.Nxf7?!, 11...Rf8, so that move would be pointless.  I told him that this move is better, in my opinion.  That's because even if I had won his major piece, he would have been able to develop the other way and castle Q side.  This, however, takes away his opportunity to castle and I still get what I essentially lost, a pawn.  Which is the main reason why I moved here.  However, as mentioned earlier, a second look shows that he could protect his Rook, even if I were to take with the N.  So, this move is better, as it achieves more.  } Kf8 {Forced.} 12. Ne6+ {In the meantime, I decide to place him in back in check.  This time, however, my goal is not to win his Q.  In this position, I am only trying to put his K under pressure and make him feel stressed.  Afterall, stress can negatively affect you in a game, so that is what I'm attempting to cause.  And, I am planning on how to do that.  However, my plan is not going to work because he will just take and force an exchange.} Bxe6 13. Bxe6 Qc7 {Well, he still wants to complete development.  Despite not being able to castle, it is feasible for him to achieve what he wants.  However, it generally takes an extra move to do so. } 14. Nd5 {That, however, does not stop me from attacking his B and Q.  This time, I am trying to win his Q.  Although it looks obvious and easy to drive off, "it's not so easy."  I already know that he is going to retreat.  So, my goal is to keep attacking his Q, so that he feels overwhelmed and under pressure.  That way, I just continue to drive at it, until he has no where to move his Q away from danger.  In other words, it gets trapped.  That's because I remember my first game against binblaster, and he won by trapping my Q.  I'm just trying to remember it and apply that technique to my advantage.  Of course, that is not going to happen.} Qd8 {So, he retreats, as I expected.} 15. Bb6 {And, I reattack it.} Qb8 {So, he pulls it away.} 16. Bc7 {But, I come up with another way to go on the offense.} Qa7 {Of course, he finds a way around that.  Now, I expected him to play 16...Qe7, that also protects his Q as I cannot play 17.Bd7, due to his Q and f6 N.  This move, however, is equally effective in protecting his piece.} 17. Nxe7 {!! This move is where I really start thinking ahead.  As it turns out, this decision wins material.  I orginally thought that it only forced an exchange.  But, I am able to find a move that I almost missed.  After we exchange, I can grab one of his pawns by placing him in check, with 18.Qxd6+.} Kxe7 18. Qxd6+ Ke8 {Forced.} 19. Rfd1 {! In the meantime, I decide to bring my R directly behind the Q.  Afterall, I learned how to do this in the Alkehine Memorial Tourney, in which GM Judit Polgar commented in.  Of any game I saw, most people also alingned one of their Rooks with the Q.  From what I saw, it helped them play better.  In addition, my coach told me that this is a good move.} Nd4 {However, I also saw most of the opponents block the connection with one of their.  And, that is exactly what happened just now.  Although he never saw the game, my opponent already knows that this kind of coordination can become dangerous.  So, he is not going to allow that.} 20. c3 {?? Therefore, I thought that I had the advantage because this move kicks his N.  I inaccurately predicted that his retreat would benefit my positon by keeping the coordination.  As it turns out, that is not the case.   } Nb5 {Instead, he is going to a win a piece, which is why 20.c3?? was my first, "outright blunder".  Afterall, I am either going to lose a B or Q, as it will not be feasible to defend both.  Before move 20, white did not make any serious mistake.  } 21. Qd3 {As a result, I decide to sac my B.  Afterall, a Q is much more valuable, so giving that away is almost a losing blunder, especially against his rating.} Nxc7 22. Qc4 {Therefore, I try to get something back with this move, a piece.  But, that is not going to happen, this time.} b5 {Instead, he kicks my Q.} 23. Qc6+ {But, I do not give in.  Instead of moving it away, I decide to take advantage by placing him in check. } Ke7 {Forced.  In this position, his only other option was 23...Kf8, but then I get a draw by repetition after 24.Qd6+.  Of course, he kept that mind, before making this move.} 24. Qd6+ {! Nonetheless, I am still determined to put him under pressure and produce stress by continuing to place him in check.  However, my plan is not going to work, as he will be able to get out of it and eventually find a safe spot where it will no longer be feasible to do this.  On the other hand, he told me that this is another good move.  But, it's for the wrong reason.  My coach implied, what I mentioned on move 19.  That it's generally a good idea to have your Q directly in front of a R. } Ke8 {Also forced.} 25. Bd7+ {So, I try to find a different strategy to put pressure on him.  Although it temporarily works, he will find a way out of this.  First, he will exchange my B for his N.  That, however, is something that I did not want because I am behind in material, but I don't have a choice, at this point. } Nxd7 26. Qxd7+ Kf8 {Once again, this is forced.} 27. Qd6+ {So, I take advantage, with this move.} Kf7 {This time, however, he finds a way to get rid of the pressure, throughout most of the game.  That's because this move was not forced, and that's what I mean when I talk about stress.  It's about Psychology and the, "Fight or Flight" response.  By putting him in a situation where he is forced to make a certain move, If I were black, I would feel a little stressed nervous.  So, I am now trying to use that to my advantage because I know that too much can adversely affect your performance, if you get overloaded with that.  Of course, he is not going to allow that since he taught me how to handle that situation.} 28. Qxe5 {However, that is not going to stop me from taking his pawn.  At least, I have some compensation for what I previously blundered away.  Note: this pawn is free.} Rhd8 {At this point, he wants to exchange rooks.} 29. Qf5+ {But, I am not going to allow that since I am still behind.  Therefore, I decide to place him in check, but this will be my last time, in doing so.} Kg8 {! He also could have 29...Kd7 or 29...Kd8.  But, this is the best move, in this position.  Had he moved anywhere else, his WK would not be as protected.  BTW, I am alluding to king safety.} 30. Rde1 {?? In this position, I am trying to bring R close to the Q.  In most games that I witness, the opponent usually aligns one his or her Rooks to the Queen.  According to my opponent, however, this is the losing blunder. When the game was over, Mr. Stockel said that I did not have time to make this move.} Rdf8 {Of course, he decides to kick my Q.  He also could have reattacked one of my Rooks with 20...Re8, but this is the move I thought he would make.} 31. Qe4 {At this point, I thought that my problems were all over.  In fact, Mr. Stockel said, "that is allowed."  BTW, he was alluding to this move.  But, is is the only the beginning of white's problems, as we will see shortly.} Qxf2+ {For a change, he decides to place me in check by taking my f pawn.  Now, I know that I'm in a lot of trouble.} 32. Kh1 {Forced.} Rae8 {After taking my pawn and placing me in check, it looked like he was going to win my Q for a R, and that's what I told him.  In fact, I resigned on that ground.  However, my opponent accurately showed me how we could exchange Queens.  Therefore, I asked Mr. Stockel, if resignation was premature.  He told that it was not.  Why?  In a few moves from now, Jack said that he will be able to promote a pawn, and there was nothing I could do to prevent it, even with best play.  In fact, he showed me how black could queen.  In that, the position is hopeless for white.}
