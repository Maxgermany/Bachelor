[Opening "Sicilian (B95), Najdorf, 6...e6"]

1. e4 {My usual.} c5 {Normally, I play against the Ruy Lopez.  But, I believe, that Jack's idea is getting me out of my comfort zone which I find good for learning purposes after what I noted in a recent epic game with my mentor.  So, he does something a little different.  However, I know this style of play, as well.  When Jack doesn't play 1...e5 he generally answers with the Siclian Defense.  And, as noted, this is the first defense that he made me learn.  So, just like what I've done in the past combined with what happened in my first game against tipsyjourneyman, we're going into the Open Variation.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {It's here that I don't know what to do.  So, I continue with my development, whilst putting pressure on his Nf6.  The idea being is to treat this, as though, it were a Ruy Lopez Opening, but with a different position.  That's because in the other opening, black's Nb8 is advanced which is why white plays Bb5.} e6 {As usual, Jack imposes his pin.} 7. Bd3 {So, I try to take advantage of that by continuing my development.} Be7 {So, he develops, whilst, breaking the pin.} 8. O-O {And, that's when I use the opportunity to get my monarch to safety.  Joe: I'll castle or go home.  Jack: Very good.} Nbd7 {Continuing with his development.} 9. Re1 {But, since my development is complete, and I've castled, I'm continuing center control by centralizing one of my Rooks.} h6 {He hits my B.} 10. Be3 {And, I protect.  It is true that I also could've defended with 10.Bh4, for sure.  But, that enables him to play 10...g5, forcing 11.Bg3, where I feel that it would be cramped because I wouldn't know of a better place to the Bishop, afterwards.  So, my attitude is to prevent that by trying something a little different.  In doing so, I'm also working on getting out of my comfort zone.} b5 {Getting a pawn chain.  But, there's more to it then meets.  As, I assume that Jack intends to play 10...b4  Normally, I wouldn't mind being forced to defend with 11.Nce2, except that my N is crammed there.  And, as many know, I try to avoid the cramp position as that's where I once started to go wrong.} 11. b4 {So, I stop Jack's plan with this move.} Bb7 {So, he continues with his development and attacks my e4.} 12. Bd2 {Therefore, I defend, as I'm counting his attacks against my Defenses.  And, in doing so, I realized that my DSB was blocking a defender.  By playing this, it's unblocked, so that, Jack doesn't win anything, yet.} Ne5 {Putting pressure on my d3.  I know because of what happened in a different training game.} 13. f4 {So, I stop it by attacking his Ne5.} Nxd3 {He takes.} 14. cxd3 {And, I take back.} Nd7 {I'm not sure why Jack retreated and cramped his N.} 15. Qg4 {But, I try to take advantage of that by attacking his g7.  He said, "Oho, look at that.  Allright, that's allowed."} O-O {And, I said, I figured that you'd castle, at some point.} 16. e5 {Meanwhile, I go for a pawn exchange.  And, it's a clear indication that Jack was going to accept because he said, "That is allowed."} dxe5 17. fxe5 Bg5 {Trying to exchange material, and I go along with it.  My idea is to just exchange with stronger player.  After a different training game, I felt that I might benefit from accepting that.} 18. Bxg5 Qxg5 19. Qxg5 hxg5 20. a4 {Knowing all that and my semi open file, I attack his b5.} Rac8 {But, he reattacks my N.} 21. Nb1 {I discussed this move with him.  But, not knowing what to do, I retreat back here.  I felt that anywherelse, except for the rim, would lose it.  And, I don't want to place it on the edge of the board as, first, that's how it loses value.  Second, I'm trying to set a good example of my students since a Knight on the rim is grim.} bxa4 {This is where he captures.} 22. Rxa4 {Like before, I take back.} Rc7 {At first, I wasn't sure why Jack played this.  But, after what's occurring and how the game is developing, yes, it all makes sense.  The idea is that he anticipates my next move since I like exchanges.  In the process, I'm forced to recapture with my Nd4 which enables him to create a nasty threat.} 23. b5 {So, I attempt to do another exchange, which he accepts.  However, this could, for the future be bad.  Thinking about what I like to do is a way that I miss the overall picture which shows just complicated this game gets.} axb5 24. Nxb5 Rc2 {I'm lucky here, but Jack has a threat which cannot be ignored.  But, I realized that, in the future, that threat could become a reality, in which I wouldn't be able to defend.  Yes, a good example was that loss with bhidragon.  I look at other factors and compare it here.  Not as extreme, but we could've been talking about inevitable problems.  However, there is a way out since he threatens to win a pawn with discovered check.  I could open up by advancing the g pawn.  But, I'd rather not expose the monarch yet, since we're just a little off from the endgame.} 25. Rg4 {So, I stop the threat with this move, instead, as it is a little more aggressive.} Nxe5 {Up to my surprise, Jack takes.  The reason for being surprised is because I'll take the N.  But, then comes a different line which is also interesting.  In fact, I told him why this move surprised me.} 26. Rxe5 Rc1+ {He said, "Yes, but I need to do something to get it back."  And, it is, obviously, this move.} 27. Kf2 Rxb1 28. Nd6 {So, I attempt to exchange here.} Bd5 {Unlike before, however, Jack declines.} 29. Rexg5 {Therefore, I even things out by taking his pawn.  And, now, this has become an endgame.  This means that I will be using my monarch, pretty soon.  But, I start things by threatening to win a pawn, but I'm also keeping in mind that one should bring the Rooks together and align them on one file, after a loss against this mentor just before I went to Florida in February. } g6 {Protecting the pawn.} 30. h4 {So, I try something different, as this will advance to h5 in the future which is the plan.} Rb2+ {Not waisting any time, he delivers a check.  } 31. Kg1 {Not knowing why he'd do that, I tried to get a draw by rep since I anticipated 31...Rb1+.  And, the idea is that I'd go back to f2, and this would continue until I could declare the draw.} Rd8 {Not surprisingly, Jack stops that by attacking my N.} 32. Ne4 {Not being able to do everything, I decide that if he's going to take, I get something out of it.  Therefore, it's an exchange, as opposed to, the loss of a piece.} Bxe4 33. dxe4 Kh7 {Getting his monarch in the action.} 34. h5 {And, this is where I advance in an attempt to promote.  But, that's a very long range strategy.  I'm also keeping in mind that Jack can't take it, without getting mated.} Rg8 {So, he gets rid of the pressure.} 35. Kh2 {Consequently, I play this to get the distant opposition.  } Re2 {Putting pressure on the e file.} 36. Kg3 {But, I don't care because of what the monarch does, in the endgame.  } Kh6 {Increasing the power of his King.} 37. Kh4 {?! Therefore, I go back to the distant opposition for the same reason as noted earlier.  However, Jack implied that this is where I start to go wrong.  By that, he was alluding to this position since my monarch, along with the Rooks and h5 pawn are tied up.  It's even but the problem is my e4 which is an essential pawn.  While it's defended now, that pawn is weakened and can run into problems later on.  The idea is that my position is locked, and thus, restricted.  In doing so, he implied that better would've been Kf1 followed by Ke1.  The idea being would've been to centralize the monarch where I could then handle the threat against e4.  By playing this, the pawn is more vulnerable.} Re1 {Threatening a nasty check.} 38. hxg6 {Which I stop by exchanging.} Rxg6 39. Rg5xg6+ fxg6 40. Kg3 {Seeing how powerful his monarch now is, I pull back.} e5 {Jack advances.} 41. Kf2 {I don't know what he was aiming for when playing 40...e5, but I don't want to chance because as archduke_piccolo said, "Don't trust your opponent."  Whatever it is, I don't trust Jack either.  So, I decide not to chance by attacking his Rook since it appeared that he was planning to use that for a devastating against my e4.} Ra1 42. g3 {This is where I take advantage of my opportunity to advance.} Ra4 {Still hitting my e4.} 43. Kf3 {Once again, I defend.} Kh5 {Putting pressure against Rook and King.} 44. Rh4+ {So, I return the favor by placing Jack in check, as his next move is first.} Kg5 45. Rg4+ {And, the idea behind was this move.  Like before, I'm trying to get a draw by repetition against him as this is a drawish position.  In the past, I offered Jack a draw, but he's declined.  In fact, we discussed it in the end of what would've happened if it were offered.  It turns out that he also would've declined because of the same thing.  In it, Jack said that you had to play out the draw and earn before he'd accept the offer.} Kf6 {With that being said, I presume that he saw my intention which is why Jack played this, as opposed to 45...Kh5.} 46. Rh4 {Knowing that it's not easy, I attempt to pin Jack's g6.} Ra3+ {Which he stops with this move.} 47. Kg4 {?? This, however, is where I really go wrong.  In other words, it's the decisive mistake.  Ok, things aren't locked in anymore.  But, my monarch was needed in the center, as opposed to away from it.  In fact, he implied that this is the losing blunder.  The other move which I mentioned being 35.Kh2 was not the losing blunder.  And, it wasn't the K move, per say.  But, rather things along with that were locked in which made it vulnerable because I couldn't use the full power of my monarch.  However, that did not mean that I couldn't defend against it.  But, with this move I can no longer defend my e4 which is the essential.  As, once Jack takes, he'll have an unstoppable passer.  With that being said, 47.Ke3 was the only way to save this position to prevent his next move.    } Re3 {As noted, that pawn is now a goner.} 48. Kh3 {Trying to prevent a check.  But, it doesn't matter much anymore.  That's because white has no good moves left.} g5 {Hitting my Rook.} 49. Rh6+ {So, now is the time to throw in the check for the thrills of it since white is busted, anyhow.} Kg7 50. Re6 {At first, my attitude was that if he takes, I'll take back.  Can't happen because of how far up his Rook is.} Rxe4 {After this move, we discussed what would happen.  In fact, I resigned because I only had 10 or 15 minutes before having to leave.  Plus, with the Rook behind passed pawn, he was going to promote.  But, even then, were it not for the time crunch, I would've played on.  And, Jack said that resignation was premature.  So, the next 5 moves are some of the variations we played through.  After that, we did a little more, but I lost track.} 51. Re7+ Kf6 52. Rh7 Re1 53. Kg4 e4 54. Ra7 e3 55. Kf3 Kf5 {But, he was showing where I might have been able to draw against a weaker player.  That's because if black were to blunder by letting my monarch in, I would've been able to take his g5.  He showed me where that could happen.  But, against his strength, it won't work.  For afterwards, we spent two or three more minutes studying what Jack would've done and how he would've prevented the draw.  He would've brought the monarch in, similar to this, so that, I would not get that pawn.  Then, he'd keep pushing his e pawn until a promotion was inevitable.  After this game, we spent the remainder of what I had left continuing Tom's game against Jack as Homework because of what happened in this game.  Yes, Tom came in a little earlier then usual.  As what usually happens, there was not enough time for him to finish against Jack.  Tom's only advantage was being a pawn up.  However, it was a question of what to do with that passed pawn since they were doubled.  With time running out for him, Tom offered a draw which Jack accepted.  So, we continued, and likewise, he showed what the monarch can do in the endgame.  And, I played a move that would've lost that extra pawn.  Afterwhich, it would be, more or less, drawn.  But, the idea is that Jack would've gotten it back with his King.  With that being said, the morals are, first, you don't want anything tied down, but especially in the endgame.  What I noted on the 35th, although not the losing blunder was the first of the problems being that my R+K were tied down and couldn't do as much.  That enabled Jack's pieces to get more powerful.  Second, but more importantly, came the 47th move, in which, my King was out of play when getting out of check.  Instead of centralizing it with 47.Ke3 where my e pawn would've been protected, I played 47.Kg4?? which enabled Jack to win the important pawn.  After that, things were going to go downhill.  So, other lesson is that since the monarch is a powerful weapon in the end game, keep where it's needed.  Don't move the King away from where it's important, as otherwise, it's out of play.  As, bringing anything out of play, but especially, in the endgame can have devastating consequences, as they did here.   }
