[Opening "Philidor (C41), exchange variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The first two moves is a common them for me as white.  But, he played the Philidor's Defense.} 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {So, I stick to mainlines, for now.} c5 5. Nf3 {Still sticking to mainlines.} Nf6 6. e5 {Deciding to now deviate.  The bad thing is, as noted, this happened before my first lesson with Ken.  So, my attitude is trade pieces when possible.  However, one reason here that didn't occur in that training game, is that, when all is said and done, Loyd will lose his right to castle.  But, that's a minor thing, as I'm about to find out.} dxe5 7. Qxd8+ Kxd8 8. Nxe5 Ke7 9. Bc4 {Figuring that I already have an initiative, I continue with my development to enable castling on my next move.} Be6 10. O-O {While not the main one, since it's about K safety, I anticipated 9...Be6 in the aftermatch of my playing 9.Bc4  Therefore, the idea was to exchange pieces early.  Now, had this been after the training game, that wouldn't have been my attitude.} Bxc4 11. Nxc4 Nc6 {Continuing with his development.} 12. Be3 {But, so do I.} Ke8 {Getting his monarch back to safety.  This is where I start overestimating the damage of not being able to castle.  Come to think of it, I now remember something that archduke_piccolo said which is that the loss of castling rights is minor.} 13. Re1 {Remaining calm but figuring that I still have an initiative, I centralize my Rook as it is a way to control the center.} b5 {Attacking my N.} 14. Nd6+ {?? Instead of retreating back to d2 (which I should've done) I decide to place him in check, without giving this enough thought.  As now, he is going to win my N.  The thing is that I did calculate a variation (which you see on my next move).  But, the bad news is that I didn't see what came after which is multiple variations.  Yes, I'll get a pawn back, but I was calculating the win of a piece back, to wind up a pawn ahead.  Well, that only works with one move which Loyd isn't going to allow.  At best, I'm going to wind up the equivalent to two pawns down.  } Bxd6 15. Bxc5+ Kd7 {That's because in the variation, the only move that came to mind was 15...Kd8  In other words, that's the only thing I calculated, as opposed to, other responses.  As now, I'm in trouble.} 16. Rd1 {Figuring, however, that I'd get something back, I decide to attack his Bishop.  The idea is pressure as I figured that Loyd would have no idea what to do, and as Ken mentioned in our discussion, that's what pressure is all about.  With that being said (since it was before) I didn't know it was pressure, so the idea was making it so that Loyd wouldn't know what to do.  But, I'm in for a rude awakening.} Ne4 {With this move, as his Bd6 (though still pinned) is now protected.} 17. b4 {So, I try to calculate another plan with support on my B.} Kc7 {So, Loyd breaks that pin with this move.} 18. a4 {? So, I start getting really aggressive and become unsound.  But, this is a mistake.  My idea was him taking the pawn as then, I'd take back the piece, or exchange, and try to get back a pawn.  The problem is that I only calculated one, as opposed to, multiple variations since there's more then one threat.  I anticipated the next move, but the variation only involved 19...Kxd6, which would've won back a pawn, as opposed to, 19...Nxd6 which is in his favor since Loyd is ahead.  I figured that I'd be able to get enough compensation which isn't so.} Nxb4 19. Bxd6+ Nxd6 20. c3 {So, I attack his N, in an attempt to get something back.} Nc6 21. axb5 {But, now I have gotten a pawn.  But, it doesn't compensate for what before, since I'm still down by the equivalent of 2, as opposed to, 1 pawn with my previous mistake.} Ne5 {Protecting his N, to prevent me from getting anything else back.} 22. Rd5 {Like before, I'm trying to put Loyd in a situation where he doesn't know what to do.} Rhe8 {But, it doesn't work since he centralizes his Rook with a back rank mate threat, that I'm about to overlook.} 23. Ra5 {?? Trying to put pressure on his a7 with the plan of 24.b6+  However, were I successful, this wouldn't have worked.  Without it being Hope Chess, which I don't like too much either these days, but with a very similar idea to what happened in my game against Ken, I'm hoping that Loyd will blunder and allow me to compensate for lost material.  Not to my surprise, though, it won't work out.  In fact, this attempt is a terrible blunder, as now, I'm going to lose my Rook without any compensation or get mated.  So, by attempting this, I miscalculated the multiple threats that white black which was part of the first lesson with Ken.  Much better was to open up by advancing the f, g, or h pawns.} Nec4 24. Rc5+ {Figuring that I could still compensate, however, I place Loyd in check.  But, this is now, in reality, a resignable position.} Kd7 25. Rc6 {Not knowing that, I now think about trying to get a passed pawn.  But, with this move, however, it's mate.} Re1# {After which, Jack got really angry with me.  That's because he's told me, many times (mainly in our training games) to watch the King.  In fact, he made note of that, by yelling something like, "HOW MANY TIMES MUST I TELL YOU TO LOOK OUT FOR THE KING"  But, I had a closer look at this and realized that there was not much else but to lose the Rook or have this happened, and I only figured that out now.  So, the first moral here is identical to the first lesson with Ken.  That's being aware of multiple, as opposed to only, one threat that the opponent has in stock.  But, another good lesson which I previously learned from Jack is not to try anything fancy when you're in trouble or the opponent has the advantage, which is what happened here.  Instead, try to figure if you can still save the position, and if so, how.}
