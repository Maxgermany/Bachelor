[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B04), modern, Larsen variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 {Alekhine's Defence.  It was ages since I'd looked at this opening or played a serious game against it, so I had to do a bit of serious thinking on move 2!} 2. e5 {The standard response if my memory is correct...} Nd5 {As expected.} 3. d4 {I think the main alternatives are attacking the N again with 3.c4 or 3.Bc4 or playing 3.Nf3 but this seems the soundest. } d6 {Black immediately assaults White's centre.  I could remember having seen and played 4. exd6 in response but thought it seemed like a waste of time: better to develop a piece, so ... } 4. Nf3 {Knight before Bishop ...} dxe5 {The logical follow-up.} 5. Nxe5 {I preferred this to condemning my N to defensive duty.} Nd7 {Black immediately continues to attack White's fledgling centre but I think this was the wrong way to do it.  Just before the game, my colleague Andy Robins had been showing me some nice tricks he'd played against the Dutch Defence recently.  These had exploited a hole at f7 and now my attention was drawn to that square: 6. Nxf7 forking Q and R, so Black is forced to play 6...Kxf7 when 7. Qh5+ followed by Qxd5 recovers the piece and wins a pawn.  So} 6. Nxf7 {!} Kxf7 7. Qh5+ g6 8. Qxd5+ e6 {and now I had to think again ...} 9. Qf3+ Nf6 {Black blocks the check, frees up his queenside a bit and threatens to recover the pawn by capturing on d4; but if I play carefully, I can inhibit Black's development while pursuing my own.  For example, Black's Bc8 is tied to the defence of b7, which can't move because it's pinned against the Ra8.  I can also tie Black's Q to the defence of f6 by attacking the N with Bg5 and put pressure on the isolated e pawn with Bc4. } 10. c3 {First though, I decided to solidify the centre a bit.  I preferred this to 10. Be3 because I wanted the B to be more aggressive.  This does have the disadvantage, however, of depriving my N of its best square.} Bg7 {A sensible developing defensive move, preparing a form of manual castling as well.} 11. Bc4 {Developing aggressively and preparing also to castle.} Re8 {I had expected 11. ... Rf8, preparing ...Kg8 and N moves to expose an attack on the Q but this reinforces the defence of e6 so seems OK.} 12. O-O {Quickly getting my K off the half-open file.} Kg8 {As expected.} 13. Bg5 {B before N in this case because 13. Nd2 would have blocked the B in and 13. Na3 would have marginalised the N.} c6 {Necessary to enable Black to develop his B from c8, not that it can go far.} 14. Nd2 {aiming for e4, whence it will attack Black's N ...} h6 {Black pushes White's B back but at the expense of weakening his pawns.} 15. Bh4 {maintaining the pin.} Qe7 {At first this seemed slightly mysterious but all soon became clear.} 16. Rae1 {Completing my development before moving the N a second time.} Qf7 {Now it looks like Back will park his N on d5 and offer to swap Qs but I preferred to do it my way ...} 17. Ne4 Nxe4 {Now I pondered just recapturing with the Q but reasoned that the pawn advantage would be emphasised if I took the Qs off and then pressurised the isolated pawn on e6.} 18. Qxf7+ Kxf7 19. Rxe4 g5 20. Bg3 Bd7 {Back is gradually relieving his congestion and nearing completion of his development without having suffered any serious disasters.  I was beginning to think that I had missed my chance of a crushing win but still felt that I had a significant advantage, not least in time, as I was about half an hour ahead on the clock.} 21. Rfe1 a5 {Black seeks some counterplay by starting to mobilise his Q-side pawns.} 22. f4 {I continue my central attack, trying to open the lines to his K.} b5 {Clearly Black wants my B off the a2-g8 diagonal} 23. Bb3 {Not yet- he'll have to force the issue ...} a4 24. Bc2 gxf4 {Somewhat surprising as it helps me with my objective but Black's options were limited.} 25. Rxf4+ Kg8 26. Bg6 {Taking advantage of its new diagonal, my B harasses Black's central R and threatens to help my R onto the 7th rank.} Ref8 27. Rfe4 {Doubling up again on the e-file and threatening to harass the R again with Bd6.} Rac8 {Black hopes to get counterplay with ...c5, attacking the head of my pawn chain on d4} 28. Bh5 {Rerouting to g4, whence it will, once again, attack the weak pawn on e6.} c5 29. dxc5 Rxc5 {Black's position looks much freer now but the e6 pawn is doomed.} 30. Bg4 Bc6 {a further attempt at counterplay but I think ...Re8 was called for.  I pondered forking Black's Rs with Bd6 immediately but could seen no lasting advantage that way...} 31. Bxe6+ {First grab the pawn with check, then save my R and, if possible, win the exchange.  That was my new plan.} Kh8 32. Re4e2 Ra8 33. Bd6 {OK - I don't force the win of exchange yet but the attacked R has few escape squares available.} Rg5 34. Be7 {and with only 8 minutes on his clock against my 44, he gave up the ghost.  34. ...Rg6 loses to 35. Bf7.  34....Rh5 would have survived a bit longer but also looked hopeless.}
