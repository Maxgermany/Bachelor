[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence, Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 {I played my usual opening but wasn't sure how Stanley was going to respond, since I remember playing him as black.  And, when that happened he played 1.d4, and I responded with 1...d5 which turned into not just the QGD, but the Slav Defense.} e5 {But, once he played this, I was certain that I'd be able to turn it into the Spanish Opening since I was certain that Stanley was familiar with this due to his strength.  In fact, he surprised me because in our next game, he introduced me to the Wing's Gambit.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 {This is how Jack often responds to the Ruy Lopez.  And, what I enjoy is seeing the N pinned.} 4. d4 {I was interested in creating a second attack, after pinning.  But, better might have been 4.Bxc6  Of course, I don't enjoy trading B for N without a good reason, but this doubles up his pawns.  However, it just wasn't enough of a reason for me to exchange since in a different game with doubled pawns, the opponent was better off once I exchanged his N for my B.  Similar to what Ken mentioned during our training games, I felt that there was tension on c6 and didn't want to alleviate it in any shape or form.  In addition, I was treating this like a Philidor's Defense since after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 white's best move is 3.d4  The idea is that when black advances his pawn one square in the opening, white's best off playing d4 next.  I felt that this was no different.} exd4 5. Nxd4 Bd7 {Breaking the pin at once.  But, that didn't bother me at all since my plan is to castle, which I'll follow up with.} 6. O-O Nge7 {Continuing with this development.  I would've played 6...Nf6 to allow the Bf8 to come into play.  However, there is a good reason why Stanley didn't play that, as this move will allow him to relocate the N to h4, later on.  And, that square will prove to be more powerful.  In addition, he's threatening to exchange my Nd4 in more then one way.} 7. Nb3 {So, I pull back.  But, I might have been better off to with the exchange anyhow.  I generally don't think that since it alleviates his pressure.  However, ...Nh4 is going to become a very powerful spot for that N.  In contrast, it doesn't need to be.} Ne5 {So, Stanley threatens to exchange my Bb5.} 8. Be2 {Unwilling to exchange with 8.Nd4, I pull back since I don't have a good reason to allow an exchange.} Ne7g6 {Stanley is already planning a better square for his N.  As noted, ...Nh4 will prove to be dangerous, but it can be stopped.} 9. h3 {I played this to prevent ...Ng4 because Jack told me that N's become dangerous once they advance too far.  In a consultation game, however, dynamic_dv said that it was, "hogwash" against Janet sine she was threatening to exchange B for N.  Although we're not getting to exchange, Dave was right there.  This wasn't going to be something to worry about since there's a bigger threat which I'm about to overlook.  But, 9.g3 or 9.f4, would've stopped the threat and was, therefore, best.} Be7 {Continuing with his development, but as black I would've played 9...Qc8 because of what's about to happen when he plays it on his next move.} 10. Nc3 Qc8 {As Stanley is now building his army around the K.  I didn't realize until I go wrong which is about to happen.} 11. Be3 {As my focus was on catching up on development.  But, there was something much more important to be aware of since Stanley is about to sac his B.  It looks lost now, but there was one move that would've kept me in.} Bxh3 12. gxh3 {?? And, that was 12.Bf3.  I was thinking hard about whether to take back or not since the idea is to not trust your opponent. So, I wasn't going to think about whether he made a blunder or not. Instead, I was basing on whether I saw an immediate threat or not. My thought was that if gxh3, he might play ...Qxh3, which I was not worried about. What I was weary of was the possibility of ...Nh4 which I was concerned about. I then asked myself what would become of that. I then thought that this wouldn't cost me either because if ...Nh4, I have Bg4 to stop any threat that's coming. Therefore, it wasn't about trust or not, but what kind of threat I was dealing with.  So, I decided to capture here. } Qxh3 {Not only wasn't I worried about Stanley playing this, but it was a conditional move, as well.  As I had planned this to allow my next move.} 13. Bh5 Nh4 {But, I was not prepared for this move.  I thought that Stanley was going to 13...Ng4 with a similar threat.  And, I'd be ready to stop it by exchanging.  But, this is where I started to coming to the realization that white is lost.  I went wrong by not looking at the entire board which both bhidragon and Coach Stockel have mentioned.  Not only is Stanley now threatening mate, but I can't bring my Q into play without losing it.  And, even if I gave up my Q, this would only delay but not prevent mate.  So, 14.Qf3, is more or less forced, but after he takes and I recapture, we're met with the same threat which would happen, at once. } 14. Bxf7+ {I thought about what to do and brought in an intermediate check by sacking my B for pawn. Grandmaster Susan Polgar said that intermediate checks can get one out of trouble.  That's in some cases but not here as the threat is back with his next move.} Kxf7 15. Qh5+ {So, I tried one more thing with this move.} g6 {But, I resigned here.  The reason being is because I thought that I must give up my Q for a N to avoid mate.  However, it's still mate after 16.Qxh4, as Stanley wouldn't answer with 17...Qxh4, but rather 17...Nf3#.  When we went over the game, Stanley said that my decisive mistake was taking with the B as that allowed him to swarm in.  Although I don't enjoy exchanging N for B, I think that Bf3 would've been the only move to keep me in. As after exchanging with ...Nxf3, Qxf3 my Q is in play and stops any threats that Stanley had against my K.  So, it's not about trust as I didn't trust him.  Therefore, the moral of this story is to look at the entire board, even the small threats.  By looking at everything here, I overlooked an important threat which costed me the game.}
