[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 {I start off with my usual.} e5 {Unlike Carl, Tom does not change his openings or defenses, either.  In fact, I know him, and as anticipated, he allows me to play the Italian Opening.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d6 {However, Tom plays this.  I don't see the point, but at the same time, I won't attempt to punish him for this move, as I've done in similar circumstances before.  Believe it or not, if it didn't limit the mobility of my Bc4, I would've played 5.d3?! with the idea of 6.Bg5?!, but that would've been a waste of time, as I wasn't far from forgetting that Tom can answer with 6...f6  So, after a thinking for a while, about 2 minutes, on what to do, I felt that castling was the way to go since I like to do so early.} 4. O-O Be6 {The idea, of course was development.  Slightly better, in my opinion was to pin with 4...Bg4  Of course, I would've taken an aggressive approach by answering with 5.h3  As now, I can exchange.  I thought that I had something better.} 5. Be2 {So, I retreated.  The only reason that I considered 5.Bxe6 was to exchange.  But, then I thought about why I'd want to do it and does the pro's outweighs the con's.  I'm always remembering what Ken stressed which is don't exchange just because you can which is the complete opposite of what Coach Stockel recommended.  But, that's also where I figured out that Jack isn't always correct.  And, that was, even before Michael emphasized it.  Having said that, the only reason I'd exchange was to double up Tom's pawns.  However, after reading what ION posted in one of my more recent annotations during a tournament, he said that worrying about doubled pawns can ruin ones game.  So, I felt that Tom's position would be simplified once I exchanged since his Be6 is less mobile.  That's something that I was determined not to allow.  But, upon further review, I think that exchanging with 5.Bxe6 was better since it would leave black's K vulnerable to exposure.  The reason being is that the exchange would occur on e6, forcing Tom to recapture with his weakest pawn on the chess board.} Nf6 {Meanwhile, Tom continues with his development.} 6. Nc3 {As do I.} d5 {Going after a pawn.  So, it's usually about why I'd want to exchange.  I usually refrain from doing, but I thought that I was going to win a piece after 7.exd5 as I analyzed, but I forgot that d5 was defended twice since I forgot about his Nf6.  However, I don't regret exchanging here because, in the long run, it's going to make things easier for me.  And, it'll be easier for Tom to make a mistake.  My instincts are telling me that Tom is going to make a mistake down the road.  The question is if I'm right.  As of the moment, it's too soon to make a determination, and it's important not to go overboard.  Going overboard has caused me to go wrong, as all of a sudden, I was overly confident and moving too quickly.  And, it was one way that I was, sometimes, losing in 10 or 15 minutes.} 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. Nxd5 Bxd5 9. Bb5 {But, upon something telling me that Tom was bound to make a mistake, but not getting overly confident, I asked myself how to proceed.  Just like what happened prior to and during my first training game with Ken during discussions, I didn't know what to do.  So, I just relied on my gut intincts.  And, it was telling me to play this move.  Although not serious yet, the idea is that Tom now faces pressure against his K with this pin since he can't break it with Bd5.  The idea being is that I wouldn't bother, if the B were on, for example, e6, where 9...Bd7  But, with the B where it is, I felt that things were already becoming difficult for black.  My of a good time is trying to put Tom in a passive position since Carl did that in my first tournament game which is how he won it.} Qf6 {And, this is how Tom answers.  I wasn't concerned.  If I felt that this would double his pawn, I'd consider exchanging on c6.  But, I probably wouldn't.  I also considered attacking Tom's Bd5 with 10.c4, but like before, I didn't want to limit the mobility of my Bd5.  But, I felt that activating his Q made things easy for me.} 10. d3 {If Tom played something else, besides 9...Qf6, I would've fianchetto'd with 10.b2 given that his Nc6 is pinned.  The idea would be to attack e5 twice with 11.Bb2.  But, with his move, my focus shifts to his Q, as I'm threatening 11.Bg5.} h6 {Which Tom stops.} 11. Re1 {Which is when I attack e5, again.} Bd6 {Not surprisingly, Tom defends again by completing his development.} 12. d4 {And, I attack again, knowing that his e5 pawn is pinned.} O-O {?? Tom played this to break the pin.  But, it is a blunder which I saw coming, as now I'm about to win a piece and liquidate, starting on my next move.  As after exchanging on c6, I'm now able to fork his Q+Bd6.  But, my instincts, starting with his 6th move was correct.  And, I saw something like this coming which is why I kept driving black back into a passive position.  Having said that, Tom could've stopped this with 12...exd4 although I would've tried to compromise his position with 13.Bxc6 or 13.Nxd4 and although I wouldn't win anything, I think that my position would still be a little better.  So, best, in my opinion was 12...e4, forcing me to do something with my Nf3 which might even leave black a little better off.} 13. Bxc6 Bxc6 14. dxe5 Qf5 {? Tom knew that he couldn't protect both of his pieces.  But, better was 14...Bxe5, getting a pawn in return.  As now, I have a free piece.} 15. exd6 cxd6 16. Nd4 {I thought about what to do.  And, my aim was to liquidate since I'm a piece up.  But, better was 16.Qxd6, winning another pawn.  In fact, that's what Tom was worried about.  I, however, felt that I could win the pawn later on, as the only time I exchange, just because it's possible to do so, is when I'm ahead.  As now, Tom will have less, during the endgame.  So, I forced it with this fork.} Qc5 17. Nxc6 bxc6 18. Be3 {And, this when I decide to complete his development.  I do it by going right after his Q.} Qa5 19. Qd4 {Better was still 19.Qxd6 winning another pawn.  But, I'm down to 27 or 28 minutes against his 35.  As after grabbing the pawn, I don't see a good continuation.  I'd find one, but it would take some time.  This, however, is where I felt that I moved a little too quickly as this was played in only a minute.  My thought is why try to win another pawn when I might have a mating sequence.  However, I had a little bit of Ghost and Tunnel Vision, as I thought that g7 was partially pinned.  Well, this would've been true, if my Q were on g4, instead.  As I was inclined to follow up with 20.Bxh6, which I figured is unplayable after Tom protects d5.  So, at the same time as forgetting what diagonal my Q covered, I was also fixated on h6 and g7.  But, I jumped the gun here, as after protecting, I'll wind up using more time then I had before.  And, this is where I'm gonna have to think about how to prevent losing on time which wouldn't have happened, if I took on d6.} d5 20. Qg4 {Figuring out that I didn't have a real threat, I moved my Q.  Of course, this fixation, which I shouldn't have had was based on what happened with my rated game against bhidragon where I failed to look at the entire board.  I think the same thing happened here but for the opposite, as it was about trying to apply too much of what happened in that game.  As now, I have a real threat, but with less time.  In fact, I now have 25 minutes against his 33.  The reason I have to worry about timing is out is that it's not just now, but for the rest of the game, Tom will have more time then me.  And, at the same time, I have to be careful and not blunder since that's also occurred, when I was low on time.  The perfect was the very first tournament game that I annotated against Carl, with which, I lost in what should've been a won game.  Well, I'm determined not to let history repeat itself.} Rfe8 {But, seeing the threat, Tom answers by half pinning my Be3.  Believe it or not, I considered and almost played 21.Bxh6?? regardless.  But, then, I realized that this would've lost an otherwise, won game.  As I thought that if 21...Rxe1+! 22.Qxg7 was mate.  Then, I looked and realized that this is what Tom wanted me to think.  And, it's very similar to my losing move against Carl where I overlooked a back rank mate which is how I, likewise, lost a won game.  As noted before, that was, when I was low on time and at risk of timing out.  But, that's when I figured out that 21...Rxe1+ forces 22.Rxe1, which might seem good since it looks like liquidation.  But, it allows 22...Qxe1# which is a back rank mate.  And, in doing so, I would've lost.  Of course, I prevent that, but now, I still have to do what's needed to prevent losing on time since it took me, about 3 minutes to find my next move.  In doing so, I'll be left with 22 minutes, against Tom's 31 since it only took him a minute to find this move.} 21. Re2 {But, after thinking about it, I felt that this was the way go.  As the idea is to either double up, or take with the idea that I'd use a combination and sac my R for a mate, starting with 22.Bxh6.  } Re4 {However, Tom saw my intention and put a stop to it with this move since my Q is now attacked.} 22. Qg3 {And, I quick play this to renew the threat.} h5 {Which Tom saw, and he protected.  After this move, I thought about what to do and considered 23.Bh6, but I didn't see the point since he could and would answer with 23...g6, after which I would not know what to do.  And, not knowing, in it of itself is where I've spent too long in past tournament game against Mariann.  Ultimately, that caused me to lose on time.  So, for a short while, I thought about what to do but seeing that my Be3 is pinned, I thought that I could get far by using that to attack his Q, again.} 23. Bd2 Qb5 {Which Tom protects by going after my b2 pawn.  But, this is where I, immediately, saw an opportunity to liquidate his Re4 and decided to capture it, right then and there.  } 24. Rxe4 dxe4 25. Bc3 {And, then as I was thinking about what else to do, I realized that this threatens mate, again.  Not only that, but it'll be difficult for Tom to drive off.} g6 26. Qe3 {After stopping one threat, I start sneaking up with my Q, yet again.  As I'm now threatening 26.Qh6 which would force a mate on the next move.} Kh7 27. Qd4 {But, Tom saw that, and stopped the threat with his next move.} Rg8 28. Qd7 {Better was to take, at once, with 28.Qxe4, but thinking that I had a threat that was difficult to drive off, I threaten mate again.  As I thought that the only way to stop it was by giving up his R for B. If 29.Qxf7, I, originally thought that, 29...Kh6 which allows 30.Bd2#  Shortly afterwards, I realized that he could, instead, interpose with 29...Rg7, but then, I'd respond with 30.Bxg7.  However, Tom protects e4 and stops the threat with his next move.  However, protecting gives me the chance to liquidate his Q.  And, with that it's safe to say that I only have about 18 minutes against his 25 minutes.  But, without over doing it, this is where I start to become more confident, as despite me missing opportunities to win another pawn; after exchanging Q's, Tom is left with, virtually, nothing left.   } Qd5 29. Qxd5 cxd5 30. Rd1 {And, with that, I knew that it was still possible to win another pawn.  I overlooked that Tom can and will protect with his next move.  However, upon overlooking that, I realized that he can't keep d5 protected for long.} Rd8 31. Ba5 {And, this is where I start realizing it since I go after his R.} Rb8 32. Bc3 {I considered and almost took on d5.  But, then I realized that he'd would get the b2 pawn, in return.  Well, I also wasn't going to allow it since I was confident that I would, eventually, win his d5 which is, as noted earlier, bound to happen.  But, Tom delays it with his next move, and that's when I attack, again.  It might seem longer, but it only took me a few second to go after his R and move my B to c3, as well, and that's due to how much happier I'm feeling about my position.  And, getting happier is also affiliated with the breathing that I learned Yoga.} Rd8 33. Bf6 Rd6 34. Be5 Rd7 {But, this is where it all happens.  Of course, Tom prevents future attacks against his R, for now.  However, he can no longer delay the amount of time it'll take to win his d5 pawn, at once.} 35. c4 {And, that's due to the fact that it's pinned to his R, which is the first thing that I kept in mind.  Of course, Tom will try to stop it with his next move, but that's when I'll capture with my next move.  The idea is to make him think that he's going to pull a swindle and win my R, in return, after 26...Rxd4, which is when I'll recapture and liquidate with 27.Rxd4.  What's more is that this will also give me an, unstoppable, passed pawn.  Although I didn't visualize, I knew that something like this was to happen starting with my 30th which is why I didn't take, right then and there, after 31...Rb8  Of course, the idea is what Coach Stockel emphasized of not underestimating your opponent.  And, that's also something that I kept in mind, when Tom played 20...Rfe8.} d4 36. Rxd4 Rxd4 37. Bxd4 Kg8 {And, with that being said, Tom tries to use his K.  As we know, it's a powerful weapon in the endgame, but it's too little too late.  The reason being is because I figured out that my c4 pawn is passed and can't be stopped, when I liquidated his remaining R.} 38. c5 {And, with that, the first thing I kept in mind is what they say about passed pawns.  So, I advanced it.  Be it note that it only took me 2 minutes to play 10 moves, believe it or not.  Yes, this is where I also focused on not timing out.  And, I also realized how much trouble Tom was in but was not going to get reckless and make mistakes, as noted earlier.  So, with that, I'm down to 16 minutes, but it took Tom 5 minutes to find his next move.  Thus, he had 24, but after his next move, he's down to 19 minutes.  So, it's close time wise.  Of course, what helped me play 10 moves in a short time frame was conditional moves.  And, by that, I'm talking about what they mean here.  As I calculated and used time when it was his turn to move.  From there, I applied the Yoga breaths to, calmly, figure out what I was going to do when he made the moves to prevent using up my time.  As before this, I was timing out, and when you combine it with my first annotation of a tournament game, I figured out how to and was; for the first time, able to cope with being low on time.  This is also why, instead of getting nervous, making mistakes, and losing a won game due to reckelessness; I became more confident, in knowing that I can be in trouble with time.  Of course, everytime I felt stress or tensioned, I exhaled it away, as learned in Yoga.  And, when given the choice, I'd rather lose by being overly confident then being nervous.  So, what I was implying is that the game could've gone the other way if I didn't know how to handle the situation.  I learned how to do so by gaining confidence which, believe it or not, is the opposite of what Ken wanted me to do in our unrated games.  But, it works for me and fits my style of doing things.} Kf8 {Not surprisingly, Tom does what he can to stop my pawn from advancing.  Similar to Michael, he hopes that I'll make a mistake and draw, or even, lose on time.  The idea is bringing the K to the pawn, and perhaps worry about something.  It was a good try because, for example, I considered something like 39.Kf1 to get my K in action.  My thinking was that perhaps he wanted because if I wait until later but do other things, he might be able to get the passed pawn.  Well, I wasn't going to allow it, and after giving it a small amount of thought, I realized that I don't need my K for now.  So, I decide to keep pushing my passed pawn.} 39. c6 Ke8 {Still trying to prevent it.  And, I figured that he wants me to play 40.f7? as doing so allows him to stop me from promoting with 40...Kd7.  So, for about 15 seconds, I thought about what to do.  But, then I realized that after my next move, Tom cannot stop my passed pawn.} 40. Bf6 {And, with it he resigned here, as he told me that I got him with my passer.  Of course, I still couldn't advance just yet since 41.c7 would still allow 41...Kd7.  So, had he not resigned, I would've been a little concerned about timing out.  But, after a minute, of thinking about what to do, I would, instead, play 41.Kf1.  And, at almost blitz pace, I keep moving up my K, until it reached the d6, where a promotion would be unstoppable.  But, knowing what would've happened had he continued, I wouldn't have resigned, as black.  As I'd be hoping that my opponent would timeout, but chances would be very slim.  After this game, Jack said that this tournament has become very interesting since I lost the first two tournament games but won the last two.  As Carl and Tom had to play each other last week.  Now, Carl defeated Tom during their first game for this tournament.  Had Tom won, we would've started all over again with the round during overtime with 3 more games.  But, because Carl won again against this opponent, I'm, officially, in the finale.  This is what it sounds, as when I come back, in about 2.5 weeks (since I'm going away) it'll be between me and Carl.  Whoever wins the next will be the champion for this tournament.  }
