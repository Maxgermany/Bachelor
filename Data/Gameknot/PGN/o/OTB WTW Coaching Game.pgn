[Opening "Hungarian defence (C50)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {This is how it usually begins when I'm white against this Coach. } Be7 {This, however, is a little different then I had anticipated, but it's still a standard move.  However, I had anticipated 3...Nf6, but even if Jack had played that, my next move would've been the same.  As one thing I like with this opening, just like the Ruy Lopez is being able to castle right in the opening.} 4. O-O Nf6 {In addition, this is a transposition of what I had anticipated.  The reason being is that, as noted, I had anticipated this a move earlier.  And, after my next move, I would've anticipated 4...Be7.} 5. Ng5 {And, that's when I go after Jack's f7 pawn.  He told me that when we had the setup that we're in right now, 5.Ng5 was a very strong move since, with the idea being that if the opponent blunders, you take with the N which forks and wins R for N.  Having said, I thought that Jack would defend with 5...d5 as it's been done to me, before.} O-O {But, he castles, instead.  This also defends, but it also makes me happy with where I stand as I felt that his position was more passive then mine here.  In fact, I thought that it might even be too passive for now which, if so, would give me a small advantage.} 6. Nc3 {With that being said, I continue developing.} d6 {Likewise, Jack prepares to get his Bc8 into play.} 7. d3 {I do the same for my Bc1.} Bg4 {Trying to harass my Q.  But, I'm about to block this attack with a counterattack, of my own.  This'll enable me to bring my DSB into play, once and for all.} 8. f3 Bh5 9. Be3 h6 {Not surprised to see him going after my N.  Of course, you shouldn't exchange just because it's possible to do so.  But, this coach implied that in the Spanish and Italian Openings, when we have this setup because you're giving up a N+B for a R+P which is of equal value.  I went ahead, but the idea was to try and expose his K since he'll use the K.  Were it not for weakening the K, I wouldn't do this.  However, I'm keeping in mind how critical the f7 square is.  But, that's where I start to go wrong because of the lesson that I'm going to learn at the end of this game.} 10. Bxf7+ Rxf7 11. Nxf7 Kxf7 {As Jack mentioned, later on, that I shouldn't have exchanged here because the N+B were more mobile then his Rf8. } 12. Qd2 {I getting my Q in action.  As now, my R's are connected.  I intend to, at some point, double up on the same file or the same rank.} Kg8 {Getting his back to where it should be.} 13. Nb5 {And, I try to challenge him with this move since I start sneaking up with my N.  I'm thinking about doing something like exchange since my goal is to, eventually be able to play Bxa7 without losing material.  But, I'd need to reposition my Q.  Well, I was about to start working on it, but Jack refutes this challenge by attacking with his next move.} a6 14. Na3 d5 {Then, Jack plays this, and I'm ready to exchange here.  Like I said earlier, I don't exchange pieces just because it's possible, but pawns are a different story.  I still won't exchange when I can, but unlike with pieces, I'm more willing to exchange pawns.  I do that, whenever the opponents pawns are in the center.  The reason being is because center pawns are often used to control the center.  So I played 15.exd5 in an attempt to take away center control from Jack.  It's safe to say that I'm also getting a little bit too confident here which isn't good, either.} 15. exd5 Nxd5 16. Bf2 {Like before, I wasn't ready to exchange my B especially with how mobile it is, so I run back here.} Bg5 {Jack then continues by going after my Q.} 17. Qe2 Nf4 18. Qe4 {That's when I counterattack, but Jack defends with his Q, as opposed to, retreating.} Qf6 19. Qc4+ {Trying to maintain pressure on Jack, I place right in check.  Of course, I had anticipated 19...Bf7, but I knew that there was a chance of him overlooking this which is how it occurred since he got out with his K.} Kh8 20. Rfe1 {The reason behind this move is that I was preparing to get my Q to e4 where it's right in front of the R.  In fact, that's about to happen, but I make a terrible miscalculation in the process that'll cost me the game.} Nxg2 {?? I was ready to take on g2 here.  But, then I thought about what someone once said of, "To take is a mistake".  The general question is when that applies.  It wasn't here as after 21.Kxg2, I thought that 21...Qxf3+ 22.Kf1 Qh1+ was mate, but it's not.  Not only that, but I overlooked that after 21...Qxf3+, white has 22.Kg1 instead.  So, I think that 22.Qe4?? was, in fact, the losing blunder.  I used my Q because I was worried that he was bringing up his army to do damage against his K in a similar way to what I saw with bhidragon.  But, I didn't look at everything here which was the problem, in it of itself.} 21. Qe4 {?? As noted, I was trying to get an extra defender against my K, but best was 21.Kxg2 which would've left me a piece for pawn up.  } Bxf3 22. Qc4 Bf4 {As I overlooked this move which allows Jack to add his Q in the mix.} 23. Ref1 {I try to stop it with this move since I was preparing to do a discovered attack on his Bf3.} Bxh2+ {But, he gets my K first.} 24. Kxh2 {I took hoping that I was in less trouble.  But, that's not to be, as things are only getting worse for me.} Qg6 {As proof his Q is a sign of a checkmate to come.} 25. Bh4 {I tried to put a stop to it here.} Nxh4 {But, it was too little too late.  I didn't realize it, but the only way to stop mate was to give up my Q, with which, the position is still resignable for white.} 26. Qxh4 {But, I took, and that's when he mated me, at once.} Qg2# {After this game, Jack gave me advice which is that after that strange in this kind of opening, I shouldn't exchange my B+N for his or her R+P on f7.  I agree with him there since the minor pieces are more active.  But, I disagree that this was the losing blunder.  It hurt me since he had better mobility, but my decisive mistake was miscalculating and failing to play 22.Kxg2 which would've won a piece for pawn.}
