[Opening "QGD Slav defence, Alekhine variation (D10)"]

1. d4 {Jack either plays 1.e4 or this move.  When he opens with 1.d4, I allow the QG.  I used to play the Colle's Systems when I was in the process of switching different openings, until GM Susan Polgar advised against that.  But, I have much more experience with declining the QG using the Slav Defense.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 {This is a common follow up in the Slav.  And, I'm starting to walk into unfamiliar territory.} e6 {So, I transpose this into the Semi Slav.  The normal QGD is with 2...e6, and I played the Slav.  But, when you combine ...e6 with ...c6, it's a transposition of the Semi Slav, since the Semi Slav starts off with 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c6, if I recall correctly.} 4. Nf3 {Meanwhile, Jack continues to develop.  But, I am about to develop by pinning his Nc3.  Not only is Jack prepared, but he has a ready answer when I do.} Bb4 5. cxd5 {As he grabs a pawn.} Bxc3+ {I would usually just recapture with 5...cxd6.  As I am obsessed with pawn chain.  But, the reason for exchanging my B for his N was to double his pawns because I was, at the time, fixated on making my opponents worth half a much.  We're talking about -0.5 for doubled pawn.  At the time, I was still in a bad habit of this, until archduke_piccolo mentioned that the -0.5 isn't even worth talking.  And, that was, shortly afterwards, combined with a students error of trying to avoid doubled pawns, but losing a piece, instead.  With that being said, I should not have exchanged here since it's B for N.  Better was 5...cxd5, where I'm capturing towards the center.} 6. bxc3 cxd5 {But, I take here to avoid losing the pawn.  However, the exchange was 5.cxd5 was not the way to go.} 7. e3 {Jack is preparing to develop his Bf1.  The idea, of course, is to castle.} Nf6 {So, I continue to develop and am prepared to castle.} 8. Ba3 {! But, this stops me from doing so since you can't castle on a side where the K is attacked.  I learned that from teardrop34, and he told me that it's an important castling rule.} Ne4 {So, I start getting aggressive here by centralizing the N.  Of course, this is the wrong way to go since I'm aiming for the c3 pawn.} 9. Qb3 {Which Jack protects.} Qa5 {So, I try to put pressure on Jack's Q side.  But, my coach also stops that by going on the attack.  However, I have a ready answer since c3 will be attacked twice.  Unfortunately, this is the wrong approach.  In other words, my thought process is wrong as we will see in a few moves.} 10. Bb4 Qc7 11. Bd3 {As Jack prepares to exchange.  } a5 {In an attempt to stop it and leave c3 vulnerable again, I attack.  And, Jack retreats as I wrongly planned to take.} 12. Ba3 Nxc3 {?? I said that my though process was wrong.  As I was studying this for several moves, and when the opportunity arrived, I took at once.  As I was not thinking about anything else.  In other words, this was the only thing that came into consideration.  In doing so, it became Flip Coin Chess, as this was played very quick.  But, this is where I go wrong, as it loses.  At the end of the game, Jack something like, "When I gave you the N, why did you take it right away?"  I told him that I didn't think there was a way to defend that pawn.  I put it by telling him that it, 12.Ba3 looked like a mistake which is why I took.   And, he responded with something like, "When I give you something you should take a little longer to think about why I'm giving it to you."  He gave this as an example being that my N is trapped and then some.} 13. Rc1 {As this is how he traps it.  I ask myself what to do since my N is now pinned to the Q.  In the end, I realized that all I could do was similar to Hope Chess.  It's not quite that, but I prepare to fork thinking that if Jack took, I could recapture and equalize, and my problems would be solved.} b5 14. Qxc3 {But, it's too little, too late.} Qxc3+ 15. Rxc3 {As now, I'm down a piece for a pawn.  But, it's about to get worse.} b4 {?? Doing what I can for counterplay, I fork, but this loses even quicker.  Best was 15...Bd7  Although it would take much longer, being Jack's strength and where I am, the game is still lose for black.  But, this gives Jack an immediate win with his next move.} 16. Rxc8+ {And, I resigned here.  As he has a skewer with this check since the K is in front and must move.  In the aftermath, he'll get an entire R without anything in return.  But, we went back to the 12th move, and what I mentioned with our chat actually happened on this move.  Similar to GM Susan Polgar's advise being, "You must ask yourself, what does my opponent want" Jack accurately pointed out that when he gives me something, I really should take more time and try to figure out why he's giving it to me.  In this case, he gave me that pawn in order to trap and win the N.  What he was also implying is that I forgot that important lesson with kenneth_fiore_3 during our second game which is that accessing a position accurately is essential.  My failure to do that is what costed me this game.}
