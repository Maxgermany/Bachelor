[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Lipnitzky attack"]

1. e4 {So, I start off with my usual.} c5 {Not knowing what names are or the openings, Carl experimented by playing this.  Jack Stockel rightly pointed out that this is the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nf3 {So, I continue with the Open Variation.  Not surprisingly, Jack instructed Carl to play the next few moves, as that's the main continuation.} d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {With this move being included with the idea that it prevents 6.Bb5+ or 6.Nb5.  I think that the main fear is checking with the Bishop.  } 6. Bc4 {Not knowing what to do after 5...a6, I play this.  But, as I learn from Jack in the third game, this is the main continuation.  And, that's because I later play the Sicilian Defense, he tells Carl to play this move since this is still the most analyzed.} Nxe4 {?? Thinking that he's gotten a pawn, Carl takes here.  Jack Stockel rightly pointed out that this is a terrible blunder.  And, that's because of my next move which will win a piece, in return.} 7. Nxe4 e5 {Not surprisingly, Carl hits my N, in return.  For a while, I was wondering what to do, and had considered 8.Nf3 or 8.Nb3.} 8. Qf3 {But, what's important is what Ken and GM Susan Polgar taught me.  And, that's when you see a good move, look for something better.  As I realized that I don't need to defend my N.  Instead, I can let him have this since this move threatens mate, in which, this is what Jack overlooks, himself.} exd4 {That's because, Jack implied that 8.Qf3 was a blunder.  As he asked me why I gave Carl the N back.  But, this is where the glacoma gets to him.  That's because he didn't realize that my next move would be mate.  What Jack does with this is touch the pieces, but for him, the difficulty is feeling the mate, rather then just the check.  That's happened before, but has continued.  And, yes, this is where that glacoma makes the difference as you can't see things the way that's normally done.  In this case, you actually need to look, and not just feel.} 9. Qxf7# {With that, this is where I deliver the checkmate.  Once I announced, and Jack felt again and used the good eye, he realized that the K can't go anywhere.  I believe that at first, he thought it could go to d7, in which, it's level.  But, he knows otherwise.  And, with it, I told Jack that this is the reason that I let Carl win back my Knight with 8.Qf3  That is due to this threat.  As the moral of this story, Jack told Carl not to play the Sicilian Defense because it is difficult for beginners to learn.  Now, some have told me that, but I disagree with Jack's assessment since it is an analyzed.  In fact, not only don't I agree, but his comment made me angry.  For, when I was a beginner, the Sicilian Defense is the first defense that Jack me learn and remember.  And, the second opening that I had to learn was, in fact, the Open Variation of the Sicilian, or Open Sicilian.  My take on it is to evaluate if you're going to lose a pawn, if you take the piece.  Plus, will recapturing lead to mate.  So, my assessment is something that Jack mentioned a couple of weeks ago, as well as, what GM Susan Polgar stressed.  And, that is to ask yourself what your opponent.  Had Carl seen what was unfolding, he would not have taken my e4 pawn.  And, if he saw this mate, he would've answered with 8...f3 or 8...Be6  After which, I would've retreated my Nd4.  Well, after this game, it was what you had expected, and Jack's analyses improves, while my assessment deteriorates which is one of the reasons that Carl will win the next game.  And, in the third game, although an unfinished, Carl will get a better pawn structure and slight initiative.  As Jack's analysis will be back to what we're used to seeing. }
