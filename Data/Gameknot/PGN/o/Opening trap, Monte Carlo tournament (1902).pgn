[Opening "QGD (D07), Chigorin defence, Janowski variation"]

1. d4 {Normally the KP opening leads to faster wins. But opening traps can occur anywhere...} d5 {The Classical response.} 2. c4 {Theory dictates this is by far the best 2nd move in this position.} Nc6 {An unusual defense.} 3. Nc3 {The logical reply.} dxc4 {A delayed QGA, where both men developed their QN's before the Pawn capture.} 4. d5 {Marshall presses the attack.} Na5 {Tchigorin protects his advanced Pawn.} 5. Bf4 {Marshall continues his development, and since it's a QP opening, he focuses on the invasion point at QB7 instead of KB7.} Bd7 {Tchigorin cautiously continues his own development. He aims to move his KP and clear lines for developing the K-side.} 6. e4 {Anticipating this plan, Marshall sets a clever trap.} e6 {Tchigorin proceeds as planned.} 7. dxe6 {Giving Tchigorin one safe and one disastrous way to recapture.} fxe6 {Tchigorin picks the wrong move. 7... BxP leaves him in a perfectly safe position.} 8. Qh5+ {Picks up the unprotected Knight at Black's QR4. Tchigorin resigns at once.}
