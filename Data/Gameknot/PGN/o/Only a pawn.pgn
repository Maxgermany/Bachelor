[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 c6 {Let's see if he lets me play my Caro-Kann. } 2. f4 d5 {I expect white to now play ex5, or some other developing move.} 3. e5 h5 {This often becomes a target; I'll have to watch for that. But it's one way to slow down white's pawns on the kingside.} 4. Nf3 Bf5 {Bg4 may have been better.} 5. Be2 {D4 might have been good. But this develops the bishop and has set up a discovered double attack on the h pawn, if he chooses.} e6 {This is done to solidify black's pawn structure.} 6. O-O {D4 for white was also playable here. No obvious way to use the early tempo for anything; it does not harm white to castle just now. And now, I have a decision. Should I allow my light-squared bishop to be taken if white chooses to? I decide yes; it's early for such decisions, but my g8 knight needs to be developed, and I don't want to advance my g pawn just yet. Still, that bishop is not really a bad bishop despite my pawn setup because of the h7-g1 diagonal.} Ne7 {I take a chance here that white won't move Nh4 or Ng5. Taking my h pawn too can be a bit of trouble, because it opens lines up now to the white king. In return, there would be a lot of pressure on black's kingside. White opps for a quieter setup.} 7. d3 {White must have already intended this developing move, and so my knight gets away with the maneuver. D4 was probably a little better for white here.} Ng6 {This is a risk too; I am betting my opponent won't take advantage of my cramped kingside before he develops a little more. My king could come under some pressure here. As an side, I am not afraid of h3 and g4 here. I have Nh4 to allow the bishop to retreat, and to frustrate that would take white too long. One other risk too, is that white could begin operations in the center or over on the queenside, as my pieces are not very mobile. It may not be wise for white to seize the black h pawn... if he does, it will be a very pitched battle.} 8. c3 {Now I've noticed that my opponent, for castling so quickly, is not developing quickly. And this move is a little slow too. I, for that matter, am very slow too. This allows me to fix my kingside.} Be7 {I ponder here whether white will wish to keep my knight out of g4, because that's where it's headed. I want to get rid of the f3 knight. I take a little too long to do that, because I need to develop more first.} 9. Na3 {Still, I get lucky here; this move is very very slow. I don't think white has a plan; it seems he is switiching ideas every couple of moves. Often when my opponent does this I'll consider taking the knight with the bishop, to double up the pawns on the a file. But, because things are a bit cramped on my kingside, I don't want to allow play to happen on the queenside just yet, because my pieces would be little help for some time over there.} Nd7 {...bc5 would otherwise be a good move. Here, I simply develop.} 10. Nc2 {I don't know why he is repositioning the knight when Nd4 would have been enough to trade a knight for the white bishop, if he really wanted my bad bishop that bad. This seems like a lot of maneuvering for little gain.} Nh4 {For some time, white could probably win a pawn; but so far, has chosen not to do so. Fritz much wanted me to castle Kingside here, and does not like this move at all. But if I castle kingside, I think my king will be vulnerable, and it will hamper my own efforts for attacking on the kingside in this position. } 11. Ne3 {This seemed odd to me; Nd4 a couple moves ago could have instantly troubled my light-squared bishop. As a result, white is behind in development now.} Nxf3+ {I finally take that knight, knowing that doing so saves the bishop. But that's not why I do so. I have thought up and discarded about three or four different plans involving sacrifices to crack open the kingside; None seemed good yet...} 12. Bxf3 {I don't know if taking with the rook or pawn would have been better for the position. In general, taking with the Bishop is correct, but this position is a bit odd.} Bg6 {White could, with just a little more preparation, strike down at the kingside with f5! and I would have to defend a while. He chooses not to, fortunately for me.} 13. d4 {He could have played d4 long ago. White is better here, but still has some decisions to make as to how to make his positional advantage work. F5 would be very good for white, and yet, for many moves, he ignores this possibility.} Nb6 {An immediate a4 is called for here to chase my knight and further throttle black's position. But my opponent chooses another move.} 14. b3 {Not a bad move; but a4 was more accurate.} c5 {This was not a good move. I had temporarily forgotten about f5 on the other side of the board, and Fritz tells me this was not good! Oh well. At any rate, now both sides of the pawn structure can be fractured while white's king remains behind his protection, more secure than I would be. I have waited too long to castle, and now don't feel comfortable castling anywhere.} 15. Kh1 {However, I luck out. White apparently wants to see what I intend, and rather than 'taking the game to me', he does this quiet move, which is useful, but probably not necessary here.} Rc8 16. Bb2 {Again, instead of f5, this move is a purely a defensive move. And, I think, not necessary. I believe black can get the initiative now.} c4 {Willing to let the a 7 pawn fall by this move for the activity it will give. Worth it? I don't know. Probably not.} 17. b4 {This just makes that side of the board protected. Despite my rook moving to c8, surely white should have realized that I would not castle kingside.} Qd7 {I wish to provoke white into advancing his a and b pawns a little, before moving my bishop to an annoying square and repositioning. Then, I'll be nearly ready to move on the kingside.} 18. a4 {I have my pawns where I want them, having obtained some space on the queenside, and greater control on the h7-b1 diagonal. These pawns won't get far.} Kd8 {Now, you might think this move bad. Fritz thinks it is. But I do it because I don't want to castle kingside, and I want my king further from the action I am planning. Since white tied things up on the d and c files, this move looked perfectly okay to me because I can obstruct the a and b pawns when the time comes.} 19. a5 {I expected that, and I was going to reposition my knight anyways.} Na8 {The least productive square for a knight. However, this knight will not stay here long.} 20. Qa4 {White moving f5, with queens still on the board, would have been very unpleasant for black. So I welcome this queen exchange. It enables me to solidify my king defense, and I think this is a mistake by white. Fritz agrees.} Qxa4 21. Rxa4 a6 22. Rc1 {And this has to be a positional blunder, if you will; f5 was still a good move to this point for white. Those pawns aren't going to move, and he's only blocking his own bishop. I don't know what he's thinking here, but I know what I'm doing now; time to begin to fight back.} Bd3 {This is a move Fritz has been wanting me to make for a while. It will harass white's ability to maneuver. Second, it's not really where I want my bishop to end up, but in the time it takes white to chase it away, I'll have received a couple of tempos for my real design, which is to attack the kingside.} 23. Nd1 Nc7 {My knight can now stop any action on the queenside, and keep white a bit on the defense of the c3 pawn now. Eventually I'd like to get it back over to the kingside if I could. We'll see.} 24. Nf2 Bf5 {THIS is where I wanted my bishop all along, and now it is white's pieces that are out of sync, due to the fact that: 1. White did not have a plan; and 2. It was hard for him in Blitz to find the opportunities that he did have. The one mistake I think that really matters is his failure to get in f5 when black's king would have been vulnerable. White's king is not served now by being on h1; my rook is still eyeing that file.} 25. h3 {There is no real threat here. If g4, hxg4 Nxg4 Rxh3+ and white loses a pawn. If white takes with the bishop, I'll trade bishops and after the knight take, the pawn still falls. But no matter white's designs, this greatly weakens the dark squares, and I immediately exploit that.} Bh4 {Rf1 still keeps white in the game. But he makes a disastrous choice; the first real blunder that gets taken advantage of in this one.} 26. Kg1 {Even in Blitz, black's next move is obvious, especially since it was in black's thoughts to target the kingside. White simply missed it. I can only speculate that white did not like his king remaining on h1. } Bg3 {It's only a pawn, but could prove decisive, due to white's lack of activity; and so also thought my opponent. Not seeing any clear counter play, white resigned, although I think doing so was a tad early since it is only a pawn! It would have been fun to play a while longer.}
