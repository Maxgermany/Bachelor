1. e4 {This game was part of an 11 player mini-tournament on the Morra Gambit (still ongoing at the time of writing). I have to admit I'm not too much of a gambit player, with the exception of my favorite opening - the Queen's gambit. Indeed, 1.d4 d5 2. c4 is not even considered much of a true gambit, as there are extremely few lines where white does not regain the pawn. So I deemed this tournament good experience, playing with both sides of a "true" gambit. Not being too experienced with gambits, I predictably got blown away in several games quite quickly, while managing to swipe a few draws from some tough competition. In this game, I've got the white army, and when my opponent delays development with pawn moves, I decide to offer up another pawn for some open lines against his king. Let's see how it works out...} c5 {Sicilian Defense} 2. d4 {This is the Smith-Morra gambit, offering a pawn to black in order to open up lines for both bishops and the queen.} cxd4 {According to the Masters database, this is black's response 96% of the time - no real reason for black to decline here.} 3. c3 {Here is the main line and true gambit, as white could immediately recover the pawn by playing 3.Nf3 Nc6 4. Nxd4 and after black takes the knight, white can take with the queen without getting as easily pestered and chased by the minor pieces of the black army.} dxc3 {This is again the main line - taking the gambit pawn. Another main line is 3...g6, declining the gambit and allowing white a strong center after 4. cxd4, but black can hit back immediately with 4...d5! challenging the center with support from the black bishop coming.} 4. Nxc3 {Natural, and the only real possibility and the point of playing the gambit - a lead in development and open lines. This was the starting position of the game.} Nc6 {Black develops naturally, keeping in check the e pawn which could cramp black's position if advanced (eventually).} 5. Nf3 {White continues developing, bringing out the knights first to their most natural squares, leaving possibilities open depending on how black proceeds with his defensive pawn structure.} d6 {One of the main two possibilities here, with the other being e6, which has the advantage of blocking the path of the white bishop to f7, once it almost certainly deploys on c4. White can then create a battery with her queen on b3, or also attack the square via Ng5 and Qf3. The advantage of d6 (and disadvantage of e6), is that the e5 square becomes quite weak, and with a white pawn established there, black's position can become cramped. Perhaps this is why the most common is actually to play both e6 and d6, one after the other on moves 5 and 6. Of course, this has the disadvantage of blocking the exit of BOTH of the black clergy beyond one square, limiting their scope.} 6. Bc4 {White clears the way for castling and develops the next most logical piece, as its presence here on this square is by far superior to any other.} g6 {Again, most common here would have been e6, which is played about 70% of the time, with second being a6 and then Nf6. Yet the move has produced solid results and is logical enough, creating a place for the black bishop, now that it's been locked in by the d6 pawn. He could greatly influence crucial squares such as e5, and put pressure on the Nc3, especially if the white b pawn were to ever move.} 7. b4 {This is where I leave the book, where 0-0, e5, and Qb3 are popular choices. My plan was to play Qb3, but after 7...e6 and then an eventual ...Na5, White will likely end up losing his powerful white king's bishop. So I wanted to stop Na5, and deploy the queen behind the b-pawn, gaining space as well at the same time. I played this move quite quickly, as I decided to be aggressive and give it a try.} Nxb4 {? I hadn't calculated all the lines after Nxb4, but my instincts told me I would have a very strong attack. I was hoping he would be greedy and take the pawn, which he did. Some computer analysis gives black an edge if he simply ignores the pawn and plays Bg7, Nf6, or f5. I would be partial to Bg7 as the undefended white knight would be pinned to the rook. A sample line would be - 7...Bg7 8. Qb3 (defending the knight and attacking the f7 pawn)...e6 9. Be3 a6 10. Rd1 b5 11. Be2 Bb7 12. O-O Rc8, where black would still have the extra pawn, but white enjoys more space and attacking possibilities, still maintaining a lead in development.} 8. Qb3 {I didn't need to think about this move at all - I had obviously seen it when I played b4. It is immensely strong as the forking action of the queen threatens the Nb4 and the pawn on f7. Note that black does not simply give the pawn back if he saves his night with 8...Nc3, as after 9. Bxf3 Kd7, the knight on g7 is overpowered by queen and bishop, but even stronger is 10. Nb5 (where mate is threatened with Qe6) Qa5+ (to create a square for the king) 11. Bd2 Qb6 12. Bc3 and black will lose his rook without compensation. And 8...e6 of course hangs the black knight instantly (his only developed piece as well, while white would still have 4!)} d5 {So of course the black army uses a powerful blocking tactic, offering the pawn back. In return, white's attacking pieces would be exchanged and black would have an ok game. A blunder of course would be Bxd5, thinking that the attack can continue on f7, as of course, 9...Nxd5, and white would have lost one of his best pieces and black would have just about equalized. Perhaps black is also hoping for exd5, which gives black a fighting chance still. Ex. 9. exd5 Qa5 10. Bb5+ Bd7 11. Bxd7+ Kxd7 12. Ne5+ Ke8 13. O-O Bg7 and black's position is not enviable, but not yet totally lost.} 9. Bb5+ {! White sidesteps all that with a checking move, forgetting about the tasty f7 morsel for now and driving black's defender back. If black plays Bd7, he gives up the knight for nothing, and still has to deal with a lot of active white pieces. So he plays...} Nc6 {Blocking the check with the knight, it is now pinned to his king, so white wants to immediately take advantage with...} 10. exd5 {Of course white does not want to exchange his formidable bishop for black's pinned knight - he keeps attacking!} a6 {Did white overlook this response? It's a common tactic - force the bishop to make a choice. Black is saying to white - fine, take my knight with your flimsy pawn, but then I'll take your annoying bishop that you keep preserving! Black is hoping for either 11. Ba4?, whereby 11...b5! would keep black in the game, or Bxc6, which would allow black to almost equalize. White, seeing that neither one of those possibilities are advantageous, continues the diagonal march of the d-pawn!} 11. dxc6 {! But isn't white going to now lose his prized bishop?} axb5 {Yes, of course, but remember the white still has 3 developed pieces, while black has none!} 12. cxb7 {Some computer analysis reveals that this may not be the most pronounced victory, and that another move (revealed later) would have been stronger. Having said that, the longer it analyzes this move, the more it likes it. What I particularly like about it is the fact that the e-pawn has "become" all the gambited pawns, having traversed the d, c, and b files. He is now just one square from promotion, having devoured three members of the black army successively. At this point I knew this must be the right move, but hadn't actually worked out the conclusion. More on that in a bit.} Bxb7 {Black doesn't really have much of a choice here. Letting the pawn take either the Rook or Bishop would be an automatic loss. Now, he is still up the gambit pawn after all those fireworks. Plus, he's finally developed a piece!  This is where I wondered whether I had a forced win, as I was stuck for a while on the idea of equalizing material with Qxb5+, but this would have left me with only a very small advantage, because after 13...Qd7 14. Qxd7+ Kxd7 15. Ne5+ (to avoid doubled pawns in the end game) Ke6, and white doesn't really have any advantage, as black will soon develop his king-side pieces and should comfortably draw.  Looking at that 15th move of Ne5+, I realized, that if I simply leave the pawn on b5, black is going to have a very uncomfortable time defending the renewed threat on black's weakest square, f7. This was the move the computer prefers on move 12, but it seems to work out about the same...} 13. Ne5 {!! A right combination of patience and bravery is required when attacking. Weaker players (myself included) often look for "checking" moves to continue attacks, but often it is far stronger to cut off an escape square for the king. This move cuts off d7, and threatens immediate mate by Qxf7. Black has a few ways to stop immediate mate, but none of them are any good and lead to horrible positions, thus my opponent honorably resigned. Here are a few of the variations:  13...e6?? 14. Qxb5+ Bc6 15. Qxc6+ Ke7 16. Qb7+ Kc5 17. Qb5+ Kd4 18. Be3+ Kxc3 19. Qb3++ 13...Nh6?? or 13...Bd5?? both lead to 14. Qxb5 Bc6 15. Qxc6 Qd7 16. Qxd7++ The only non-forced mates involve moves by the black queen, the best of which being 13...Qa5, which could lead to 14.Qxf7 Kd8 15. O-O Qxc3 16. Bf4 Bh6 17. Rhd1 Kc7 18. Rac1 Qxc1 Rxc1 and mate to follow with the coordinated white pieces bearing down on the helpless black king, undefended by his castles still on their starting squares.  Thanks to my opponent for a fun game. Please rate and comment, feedback is much appreciated. }
