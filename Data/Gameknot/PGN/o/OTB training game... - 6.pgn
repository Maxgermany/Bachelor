1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {theory dictates Bc5, c3, Nf6, d4, etcetera, leading to some breed of the Italian party: this opening is usually - providing sound play from both players - not leading to very much; so I decided to go about this differently...} Nd4 {a rather innocent move: after Nxd4, exd4, we live on happily ever after; but White spots an attack: so he thinks...} 4. Nxe5 {rook in the pocket for White, after Nxf7: so it seems...} Qg5 {but this changes things a bit: a crossfire on e5 and g2...} 5. Nxf7 {also attacking Qg5...} Qxg2 6. Rf1 {forced: losing the rook means mate...} Nf3+ 7. Ke2 d5 {releasing Bc8...} 8. Bxd5 Nxh2 {a very versatile move...} 9. Rg1 {what else?} Bg4+ {an eye for an eye...} 10. Ke3 Bxd1 11. Rxg2 Nf3 12. Nxh8 {time to collect the prize, says White: but now it's Blacks' turn again...} Bc5+ 13. Kd3 {only move...} O-O-O {forcing the Black King into a deadly pin...} 14. Nf7 {salvaging the Knight, before it's too late...} Rd7 15. Ng5 c6 {our insurance, for the future...} 16. Nxf3 {here White first played Nc3: at a quick glance, a very sound development move: but after Ne5+, it is suddenly a choked mate; so White played this...} Bxf3 17. Rg3 {White retaliates...} cxd5 18. Rxf3 {the beginning of the end...} dxe4+ 19. Kxe4 Nf6+ 20. Ke5 {after long and careful thought, White came up with this: it is hard to find a better one, because Black will have it his way in any variation...} Ng4+ 21. Kf5 Nxf2 {at this point, Black is a full rook behind: but the sorry bunch on the other side of the board leaves much to desire...} 22. Nc3 {development, long overdue...} Rf7+ {but White missed this: Nf2 is blocking the King away from covering Rf3...} 23. Ke6 Rxf3 {settling the score...} 24. Na4 {White needs to find ways to develop...} Rf6+ 25. Kd5 b6 26. c3 Nd3 {just in time to prevent d4...} 27. Ke4 {White needs to get out of this spot...} Rd6 28. b4 Bf2 29. Bb2 {a costly way to develop, but White has to do something...} Nxb2 30. Nxb2 Rxd2 31. Na4 Kd7 32. Rh1 h6 33. Rh2 Rxa2 {we are reaching the end of the attack: time to make the most of it...} 34. Kf3 Rxa4 35. Rxf2 {safer this way: after Kxf2, Ra2+, Black can trade the rooks at his leasure in a won position or just outplay the White rook...} a5 {losing no time: Black needs to make the most of his pawn advantage...} 36. bxa5 Rxa5 {better than bxa5: we are still looking for ways to trade rooks...} 37. Kg4 Rc5 38. Rf3 Ke6 {Rf7+ is in the air: time to protect the little ones...} 39. Re3+ Kf6 40. Rf3+ Kg6 41. Rf4 {blocking Rc4+: but this move will backfire...} h5+ 42. Kh4 Rxc3 43. Rb4 {a last attempt...} Rc6 {White is in zugzwang: there is no way, to keep the b6 from promotion and prevent mate at the same time; so he resigned...}
