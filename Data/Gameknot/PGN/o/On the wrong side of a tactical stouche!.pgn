1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Thank goodness I decided to play this game unrated as Coach Ion, no doubt, will call my play in this one x-rated!  I thought I had some good tactical play going, but alas my opponent completely out-foxed me and I got well and truly stuffed in just 19 moves.} Na6 2. d4 {2.d4 - after my opponent responded with a Freddy-esque reply to my e4 with Na6 I just got on with making a strong pawn centre.} c6 3. c3 d6 4. Nf3 {4. Nf3 .... and supporting it.} g6 {4. ..... g6 - transposing into a kind of Pirc Defense.  That dark square bishop is gonna be the devil of Henry.} 5. Be3 Bg7 6. Nbd2 b5 7. Be2 {7. Be2 - after such sensible development, how in the hell did I lose from here?} Nf6 8. d5 {8. d5?! - seemed a good idea at the time, thought I would win a pawn but playing 0-0 here would have averted disaster methinks.} Nc5 9. dxc6 Nfxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 {10. ..... Nxe4 - knight trade.} 11. Bxb5 {11. Bxb5 - nacht.} Qa5 12. Qa4 {12. Qa4?? - overlooking a tactical sac.  Ah Ion, I only saw the sac after I had hit the submit button but I thought I could get out of it.  My opponent, however, thought otherwise.} Bxc3+ 13. bxc3 Qxc3+ 14. Ke2 Qb2+ 15. Kd3 {15. Kd3 (forced).  If I block on d2 then Glenda is a gonna to Nc3+.} Bf5 {15. .... Bf5 - threatening Nd5 double check, again snaring Glenda.} 16. c7+ {16. c7+ - I get a discovery of my own in, but alas it ain't gonna work.} Kf8 17. Bh6+ Kg8 18. Ke3 {18. Ke3 - I thought I had escaped the discovered check but alas, left my f2 pawn en prise to the Wicked Witch of the West who waves her wand, turns it to dust and cackles check in the ear of King Henry.  I either have to walk Henry back into that discovery or Cop Old Matey by playing Henry to f4 and allowing e5#, or Option C, wave the white flag.  I chose Option C.  I must now start working on my tactics even though I have increased my games workload.  All I can say is, it has been, er erm, a voyage of discovery!} Qxf2+ {}
