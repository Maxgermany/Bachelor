[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 {He starts conventionally.} c5 {I reply with my usual. The Sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to White's first move 1.e4. } 2. f4 {He plays a dangerous sideline. If black is not careful white builds up an overwhelming king side attack. 2.f4 is the Grand Prix Attack or McDonnell Attack: the latter name stems from the 14th match game played in London in 1834 between Alexander McDonnell and Charles Louis Mah√© de La Bourdonnais, won by Black. According to Jeremy Silman and others, Black's best reply is 2...d5 3.exd5 Nf6!, the Tal Gambit, which has caused the immediate 2.f4 to decline in popularity. White may decline the gambit with 3.Nc3, called the "Toilet Variation", so named after its reputed place of invention. A less common option is 2...e6, as La Bourdonnais played against McDonnell. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack nowadays by playing 2.Nc3 first before continuing 3.f4. The modern main line runs 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7. Here White can play the positional 5.Bb5, threatening to double Black's pawns with Bxc6, or the more aggressive 5.Bc4, aiming for a kingside attack.} d5 {I think it is best to strike in the center immediately to stop this build up.} 3. exd5 {So he takes.} Nf6 {I play this, rather than taking with the queen and allowing him to develop his knight to c3, attacking the queen with gain of time. This is a bot like a Centre Counter opening, except white has played f4 and black has played c5.} 4. Nc3 {White calmly develops. Trying to hang onto the pawn with c4 or Bb5 don't lead to any advantage for white if black plays correctly.} a6 {I played this, as I was afraid that if I took on d5 then the bishop check on b5 was strong. Checking on opening databases now, I see I was wrong to fear this, and simply Nxd5 was best, although a6 was successfully played in elduderino1 (1712) vs. tjbuege (1779), which continued with  5. Bc4? b5 6. Bb3? c4 7.	Bxc4	bxc4 and black is piece for a pawn up.} 5. Nf3 {But my opponent doesn't fall for that.} Nxd5 {So I take back.} 6. d4 {The pawn on f4 was attacked and this uncovers protection from his Bc8.} e6 {Protecting my pawn on c5.} 7. Ne4 {Attacking it again.} Nd7 {Protecting it again.} 8. c4 {He hits my knight.} Nd5f6 {I retreat. I chose this square, as I didn't want to give him time to play d4-d5.} 9. Nxf6+ {He takes.} Nxf6 {I take back, and notice how he can't play d4-d5 now. Notice also how we have both played 9 moves, moving only knights and pawns. We both seem to have taken the advice "knights before bishops" to extremes!} 10. Be3 {I think this is a mistake, simply Be2 was better.} Ng4 {The position is open, so it is better to have bishops than knights.} 11. Qb3 {It would have been better for him to retreat the bishop to g1. } Nxe3 {So I take it off.} 12. Qxe3 {He takes back.} cxd4 {Preparing either a nasty check on a5 with my queen or b4 with my bishop.} 13. Qxd4 {My computer suggests that white should have delayed recapturing with Qd2, rather than allow the checks. Now black has a choice of tasty checks. Which one would you chose and why?} Qa5+ {I thought this was the stronger check, although my computer prefers Bb4.} 14. Ke2 {This move is horrible. Nd2 was perfectly playable. I did look at 14.....Bd7 now (the move my computer recommends), but I didn't like the look of lines like 15. Rd1 0-0-0 16. Ne5. I also wanted to develop my Bf8 with tempo, but didn't want my g7 pawn falling. Eventually I decided on a move which prepares Bc5 and also stops his knight from coming in to e5.} f6 {Which was this.} 15. g3 {He develops. Computer agrees this is best for white and gives the position as about equal.} Bd7 {I develop. Computer prefers Bc5.} 16. Bg2 {Computer eventually plays this, after considering 16. Bh3, although I was looking at this and thinking black had after Qh5, 17. Bg2 Bc6 and I was really liking black's position.} Bc6 {Neutralizing the bishop. Computer still prefers Bc5.} 17. Qd2 {Computer prefers 17. Qe3. I was looking at this and thinking that if so, I could just play Kf7 (computer prefers Bd7). I was thinking after 18. Nd4 Bxg2 19. Qxe6+ I could escape the checks by marching my king to h6. However after Kg6 20, Qg4 Kh6?? white has Nf5+! winning the black queen. So in this variation it seems best is just to allow the perpetual check. } Bb4 {I develop my bishop with tempo. Computer prefers exchanging queens, but it is surely better to keep the queens on, with his king still stuck in the middle.} 18. Qe3 {He attacks my pawn on e6.} O-O {And I just calmly castle. Computer prefers 0-0-0, but surely my king is safer here.} 19. a3 {It is too dangerous to accept the pawn, so he hits my bishop.} Bc5 {I attack his queen.} 20. Qd2 {He offers the exchange of queens again. Computer prefers Qc1.} Qb6 {I of course refuse. Computer prefers exchanging still.} 21. b4 {He hits my bishop.} Rad8 {I attack his queen with gain of time. Computer prefers Rf-d8, although it is surely better to move the a rook, keeping the other rook for the f or e file.} 22. Qc1 {So the queen runs away.} Bd4 {and I attack his rook.} 23. Ra2 {The rook moves.} e5 {I want to open up the e file.} 24. Rd1 {He foolishly ignores my threat. I thought at the time f4-f5 was the best move for him, trying to keep the king side closed. Computer likes 24. fxe5, but I like my position after I recapture on e5 with the pawn, as I also have the open f file.} exf4 {I open the e file. I think this is best, although computer likes Ba4.} 25. Qxf4 {White recaptures.} Be3 {I like this move, although computer prefers the straightforward Rf-e8+} 26. Qg4 {Computer actually prefers giving up the queen for two rooks with 26. Rxd8 - black is clearly winning now.} Rfe8 {Black as several horrible threats.} 27. Rxd8 {White tries to reduce black's attacking potential, but to no avail.} Qxd8 {I just take back.} 28. Nh4 {As good as anything, the position is lost.} Ba7+ {Clearly winning.} 29. Kf1 {OK, stop and find black's next move.} Qd3+ {Did you see it? It is mate soon! See http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=167742  Many thanks for reading this annotation.
