[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Loyd's style is the Philidor's Defense.  So, I stick to the mainline, for now.} Bf5 {?? However, you usually exchange on d4 right away.  I'm not sure how he thought, but my guess is that Loyd wanted to try something different.  I understand that all too well since I like doing different things.  In fact, that's why I chose 1.d4, as opposed to, 1.e4 in my training game against Kenneth_fiore_3 because he played the KID against me.  It was good to learn because my student, pagmatic64, wanted practice there.  So, this gave me a way to do so since I knew how to play it.  But, it is, however, a blunder here.  That's because my opponent overlooked that I could take.  My opponent implied that he didn't see my e4.  Jack Stockel has (with his glaucoma), occasionally overlooked something like this in his expertise analysis.  But, in doing so, I'm not going to miss my chance of getting a piece here. } 4. exf5 exd4 {Now, he goes back to, something similar to mainlines.  But, this was best a move earlier.  Now, we can exchange, but he'll still remain a piece down since I'm going back.} 5. Nxd4 Qe7+ {I'm not sure why he played this right away.  But, in doing so, I'm going to block the check right away with the Queen.  As now, by playing this, I'm going to liquidate Queens, due to being ahead.  Not to mention that when I take back, I'll be one step closer to castling since I will recapture with my Bf1.} 6. Qe2 Qxe2+ 7. Bxe2 Nf6 {Continuing with his development which I anticipated.} 8. Bb5+ {As I place him in check.  The idea being is that Loyd is in a difficult situation, and I was interested in how he'd respond.  The idea behind this was putting pressure against him.  Of course, he has 8...c6, and then I drive back.  One idea here was to find a better post for my Bishop as I felt semi cramped.  But, one goal is to put pressure on your opponent.  I think that better would've been 8.Bc4 to prevent the possibility of him playing 8...c6  But, the other move I calculated is what happens next as the idea is continuing with his development.  After he does that...} Nfd7 9. O-O {I castle, at once.  But, the idea here was more then just K safety, which is in general, the only reason for me playing this.  In this situation, this was also played because of what Loyd does next.  It does confirm my instinct about him wanting to continue with his development.} Be7 10. Re1 {But, it enables me to pin his Be7.  The pin, although not serious yet, is a burden for Loyd and increases the pressure.} c5 {So, he kicks my N.  } 11. Bc6 {?? With the idea of liquidating while ahead, followed by winning a piece (which happens later) I played this.  But, what I overlooked, until viewing it here is that is a terrible blunder that should lose my advantage, at once.  As now, he can equalize.  And, when Jack makes a mistake in his analysis it's similar to this move since he has missed a pawn or a piece, where it could be taken or defended.  As noted, it's rare with Jack but quite common with me.  This needs to stop because when commenting on another student, known as superandy before playing him, I did it quite often which repeated in our game.  I had to be corrected by so many players that the annotation wound up getting deleted by Andy, himself.  Then, it occurred in our training where I wound up blundering my Queen and getting a lucky win.  It was so serious that after seeing a mistake that ION made in his game with knightrider62, I had to bring it up.  With that being said, although what I have isn't serious, this blunder was, most certainly, affiliated with my disability.  That's because what I have causes me to misunderstand or overanalyze things.  In this context, I overanalyzed what GM Susan Polgar mentioned in her book, "Chess Tactics for Champions", in the second chapter under pins which involves pinning motifs and it included a couple of Homework questions.  The idea was similar to what will happen here.  You pin a piece and an attacker to the pin.  By doing so, you tie down the opponents piece, and consequently win it.  But, that sort of thing doesn't happen when you have a situation like this.  In this context, it's his b7 which, were it not there, this would be a very effective.  Now, as per Ken's advice, I was calculating several variations, but overlooked what Loyd could and ought to have responded which would have equalized.} Nxc6 {As this was the move that I calculated, but best was 11...bxc6.  By playing this, I liqudate, but once again, I, similarly, overlooked a move that still enables him to equalize.} 12. Nxc6 Ne5 {As this is what I analyzed.  In other words, I was thinking along several lines when playing 11.Bc6?? which should've taken away my advantage.  And, after taking back, this was also the move that I calculated.  But, best was still 12...bxc6.  By playing this, that chance is gone.  As now, the best that Loyd can get now is exchanging which is to my benefit since I now remain ahead, throughout the remainder of this game.} 13. Nxe5 O-O {?? The idea was getting the monarch to safety which is why you castle.  I did analyze it, but unlike before, I did not think he was going to play this.  Instead, I thought that he would play the best move which would've been 14...dxe5, as then, my next move would be 15.Rxe5, leaving me up a pawn and piece.  By playing this, Loyd is faced with an overwhelming amount of pressure on Loyd.  And, I will remain ahead by two pieces u[, without compensation.  Those two things, was the entire plan behind 11.Bc6.} 14. Nd7 Rae8 {?? I was interested in how Loyd would respond to the pressure.  However, we, temporarlely, lost power.  I think that's why he played this.  Best would been, 14...Rfe8 because, had he moved anything else, I would've gotten another free piece.  But, this was almost as blunderous because I get a Rook for N, which is almost an equivalent.  On the other hand, I can understand this blunder as he, as well as, others were distracted by the outage.  Jack, I believe, could not see too well.  In the past, I was distracted and would've been were it not for this calculation.  But, after he castled, and I played 14.Nd7, I calculated variations, including this one.  And, It happened just before the outage which made me immune to the distraction.  On top of that, I have extremely good vision, which enabled me to see the board, even when, it was, a bit, dark.  So, I knew what to do. } 15. Nxf8 Kxf8 16. Nc3 {Being this far ahead, I decide to continue with my development.} Rd8 {Centralizing his Rook.} 17. Nd5 {But, Loyd resigned here.  That's because, on top of being where we are, I'm about to liquidate further.  In this case, I'm going to exchange his Be7 for my Nd5.  Under these conditions, black realized that he had no chance and threw in the towel.  After which, Jack analyzed to see if resignation was premature.  We did calculate a variation, which my coach knew would still be liquidation but wanted to know if Loyd stood a chance afterwards.  So, we analyzed what would happen 17...Bf6, 18.Nxf6, gxf6  On top of remaining that far ahead, his pawn structures surrounding the monarch would be destroyed.  And, we figured out that black cannot save the position.  Therefore, Mr. Stockel determined that resignation isn't premature here.  When the game was over, my opponent told me that I played extremely well, which at the time I agreed with before posting it on this website.  Another look shows that I didn't because, as noted, 11.Bc6 was a terrible move which could've allowed Loyd to fully compensate.  Even if, at the time, I saw it and disagreed, I still thanked him because I appreciate compliments, and also, I don't want anyone feeling offended and have no way of not doing it, unless I show my gratitude.  However, in the aftermath of this game, Jack gave advice to Loyd.  It was to slow down and take more time.  Although, I don't like saying it or seeming too harsh, I have to agree with that assessment.  For example, after I played 11.Bc6, 11...Nxc6 was played quickly.  In other words, black didn't give it enough time.  The same thing happened, when he played 12...Ne5, as opposed to, 12...bxc6  On top of that, Loyd followed that advice in our next two games, and won, in both of them which I'll be annotating later in the week, when time allows. }
