[Opening "QGD Slav defence, Alekhine variation (D10)"]

1. d4 {Just like with Tom Levine, this is how Stanley opens, as I've studied in some of his games with Jack.  Of course, he I stick with my usual.} d5 2. c4 {Not surprisingly, he plays the QG, which as usual, I'm going to decline using the Slav Defense.} c6 3. Nc3 {This is a very common reply.  And, of course, I also stick to the mainline by continuing with my development.} Nf6 4. Bg5 {I was not surprised to see this played.  As Stanley seeks to exchange.  Since I am not ready for that now, I stop it by cramming my other N.  But, I know that I can replace it later, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar and Ken.} Nbd7 5. e3 {I am surprised to see this played.  I thought that white plays this move in response to the Colle's Franketort System or the London System.} e6 {Therefore, I decide to copy white seeing that Stanley did it for a pawn chain.  I had no idea what to do and wasn't willing to spend more time trying to figure it out.  As this move makes me feel comfortable since I also have a pawn chain.  On top of which, I can continue developing and later castle.} 6. Nf3 {Meanwhile, Stanley continues with his development.} Bb4 {As do I with this pin as the top thing on my mind.} 7. a3 {Not surprisingly, Stanley breaks it.  I had a hard choice to make.  I normally don't want to exchange here because of Ken's advice.} Bxc3+ {?! But, this time, however, I don't hesitate to do it.  What's more is that aside from maybe from one move, nothing else came into consideration.  The reason is that he has doubled pawns.  But, this is an inaccuracy as my assessment.  I remember that Ken said it was also worth exchanging when you double up the opponents the pawn around the K.  That's what where I thought it was.  However, that, I believe was ghost vision.  As yes, he has doubled pawns, but it's no of major asset since it's around the Q side, instead.  And, I also overlooked that my Nf6 is still pinned.  With those two things, the timing wasn't right which means that my judgement still needs fixing.  That's because once he takes back, Stanley will have better mobility with the center as he is breaking through which is something that one does not want to see. } 8. bxc3 O-O {? I was just focused on castling.  And, for a few seconds, at most, I also considered 8...dxc4.  But, that's moving too quickly right there.  I didn't play it because I was worried about an exchange which wouldn't have benefited me.  What I overlooked is where his N is located.  Somehow, I thought it was on d2 or on e3 which is more likely.  I forgot that it's in a place that taking would've won a pawn.  Had I spent a little more time, I would've seen this, and thus, taken on c4.  I think that getting too excited made me think like Turtose, as opposed to, the Hair, as I've mentioned.  In doing so, Stanley will get the favorable exchange.} 9. cxd5 exd5 10. Bd3 {As now, not only does Stanley continue developing, but as noted his mobility is better because his Bd3 is free to move about, whereas, my Bc8 is not.} Nb6 {So, as noted, I repost my Knight.} 11. h3 {I am not sure why Stanley played this.  As right now, there isn't a semi open file his Rh1 is blocked, anyhow, lest he castles.} Re8 {So, I go on the attack by striking at his center.} 12. O-O {As anticipated, Stanley castles.} Be6 {And, I complete my development. } 13. Re1 {And, Stanley strikes at my center.} h6 {So, I try to break the pin with this attack. } 14. Bh4 {As anticipated, it doesn't phase Stanley.} Qe7 {So, I try something else, as now my Queen is mobilized, and more importantly are my Rooks being connected, at once.} 15. e4 {Trying to exchange pawns, but I missed the big picture.} Rad8 {? Not knowing what else to do, I centralize my other Rook.  But, exchanging was needed here.  The big picture is what's coming.  At worst, I thought that this just lost tempo which as you know, isn't my big concern.  That would be me trying to dig out my collection of chess quotes, rather then seeing the entire board.  But, I overlooked it here as it doesn't just gain tempo.  What I forgot is that my Nf6 is still pinned, so I can't get out.  At best, Stanley is going to get a favorable exchange.} 16. e5 g5 {?? Figuring that there's no way out, my attitude is very similar to my second game with Ken.  As I got too comfortable here.  My attitude is that if Stanley takes my N, I'll recapture his B.  But, I overlook what comes next since my Queen will be attacked.  And, that's why it's a free piece.  Had I been a little more cautious, I would've realized that 16...Nh7 was possible.  As that way, Stanley would win the exchange, as my N is more powerful.  But, it's better then losing material.} 17. exf6 Qxf6 18. Bg3 {As that's when Stanley retreats, and he told me that even if I prevented the immediate loss which we'll see in a little bit, he'd keep his advantage.  In other words, just like with Ken, Stanley wasn't going to give me the opportunity to win anything back. } Rd7 {Trying to figure out wherelse to go, I attempt to double up my Rooks.} 19. Be5 {But, Stanley prevents that by attacking my Queen.} Qe7 20. Nh2 {After which, Stanley played this.  I'm not sure why, but I start attacking.} f6 21. Bg3 {I figured out that he was worried about mate.  Personally, I don't think any of his last two moves were mated since I didn't see any way to mate him.} Qf7 {So, I go back to my plan of doubling up.} 22. Ng4 {And, Stanley intends to exchange.} Kg7 {?? But, I refuse by trying to use my King as a weapon since we're nearing the endgame.  That's because I don't want to liquidate since I'm behind.  Stanley, however, pointed out that this is the move that loses at once.  As I overlooked how powerful that N is.  Instead, the best move was to exchange with 22...Bxg4, as we'll see later on.  } 23. Qf3 {Not seeing the point and figuring that Stanley might be trying to mate me, I attack his N with my next move.} h5 24. Nxf6 {But, this was played instead.} Qxf6 {I can't take with the King but thought that I was fine with his move, however...} 25. Be5 {Once Stanley played this, I resigned.  That's because my Queen is trapped with this pin.  Therefore, at the very least, he will win the Queen for a piece, at which, there is no point in continuing.  After this game, a discussion with Jack, Stanley, and I ensues.  Jack: Why didn't you exchange with 22...Bxg4  Joe: I didn't want to exchange because that would liquidate further since I'm behind.  The idea is not exchanging pieces when behind.  Stanley: True, but there is a danger that you overlooked which is my N.  Jack: How many times must I tell you to be aware of the N?  Those Knights are very dangerous, and therefore, should not let them come in like this.  Stanley: Had you exchanged, I would've remained with the advantage, but black would've been ok.  By refusing it was game over for black.  }
