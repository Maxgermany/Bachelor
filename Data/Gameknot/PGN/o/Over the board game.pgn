[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Classical defence deferred"]

1. e4 {This is an annotation I have done to help one of my friends improve. I will not embarrass the player by giving the name, nor, for that matter, help opponents of my friend with their preparation. It was played in an evening league over-the board game.} e5 {Black copies white's first move.} 2. Nf3 {White attacks e5.} Nc6 {Black defends e5.} 3. Bb5 {As a Spanish Opening or Spanish Game or Ruy Lopez, named after 16th-century Spanish bishop Ruy LÃ³pez de Segura.} a6 {Black plays the Morphy Defence, 3...a6, which "puts the question" to the white bishop. } 4. Ba4 {The bishop retreats, the most common move, although exchanging on c6 is quite playable.} Bc5 {This is the Classical Defence Deferred (deferred as 3....a6 and 4. Ba4 are inserted. The classical defence is 3.....Bc4 immediately) For a century it was believed that it was safer for Black to place the bishop on e7, but it is much more active on c5. White can gain time after playing d4 as the black bishop will have to move, but this does not always seem to be as important as was once thought. } 5. O-O {White sensibly castles, probably the best move, and certainly the most common.} b5 {Black attacks the white bishop.} 6. Bb3 {Of course the only safe square.} Nf6 {Black sensibly continues to develop.} 7. Nc3 {This is playable, white simply protects the e pawn. This move has a drawish reputation. White doesn't have to worry too much about the attack on the e pawn while the black king is in the centre. The drawback with this move is that it rules out the c2-c3 followed by d2-d4 plan. White can play 7. c3 and just ignore the attack on e4, meeting 7....Nxe4 with 8. d4, 8. Qe2 or 7. Bd5, but not, of course, 8. Re1? Bxf2! 7. d3 is also playable, planning to develop the Bc1 and keeping c3 and d4 at a later date an option. White can also play 7. Nxe5, meeting 7....Nxe5 with 8. d4 or 7. a4, threatening 8. axb5.} d6 {Black continues to develop, perhaps with the idea of playing Bc8-g4, perhaps followed by Nc6-d4.} 8. h3 {White decides to rule that out, although there are other options such as  8. d3 Bg4 9. h3 Bh5 10. Bg5 Nd4 11. g4 were possible, although black can improve by exchanging on f3 with 9....Bxf3 10. Qxf3 Nd4. 8. a4 is perhaps best, with perhaps  8. a4 Na5 9. Ba2 O-O 10. d3 c6 11. Bg5 b4 12. Ne2 Qe7 13. Ng3 h6 14. Be3 Bxe3 15. fxe3 a reasonable line for both sides. So 8. h3 is arguably a slight inaccuracy.} b4 {Black hopes to drive the Nc3 away and then win the e4 pawn. The drawback of this move is that if white moves the knight to any square other than d5, then ....Nf6xe4 can be met by Bd5 forking knights on c6 and e4, for instance 9. Na4 (better than Nb1 or Ne2) Nxe4? 10. Bd5 wins for white as, as well as attacking both knights the Nc6 is threatened to be taken with check, and then the Ra8 could go too. 9. Bd5 also saves the pawn, play may continue 9....Nxd5 10. Nxd5 and although black has the two bishops, play is equal. The computer program Fritz tells me that white does best to sacrifice a pawn here with 9. Nd5, although I probably would not play that myself!} 9. Ba4 {White meets the attack with an attack on c6. Not a bad idea, it is always a good idea to look for counter-attacking moves rather than just respond to opponent's threats, but, as we saw from the previous note, white had better options, so I would call this a mistake - white's first mistake.} Bb7 {Black of course protects the Nc6, but probably better is Bd7 as this move leaves the Nc6 pinned against the black king, and therefore gives white more tactical chances. However in this game white fails to take advantage of this, and in the end the Bishop on b7 plays an important part in the mating attack on the white king.} 10. Nd5 {Fritz gives this as the second best move and prefers 10. d4, but I think white can be forgiven for not seeing all the tactical possibilities after 10. d4. I am sure I would play 10. Nd5 myself too.} Nxe4 {Black does the obvious capture, the move black has been aiming for, but it is actually a mistake! Fritz tells me that white should now play 11. d4! with advantage, for instance 11.	d4	Bxd4 12.	Nxd4	exd4 13.	Re1 winning the Ne4 (13.....f5 can be met with 14. f3). We now see how crucial it was for black to protect the knight with Bd7 rather than Bb7. Fritz actually gives as best for black after 11. d4! 0-0 12. dxc5 Nxc5 and white has an extra bishop for two pawns - what should be a winning advantage. Fritz gives as the second best move for white 11. Qe1 } 11. d3 {This lets black keep the extra pawn.} Nf6 {So the knight drops back.} 12. Bg5 {This is an excellent move by white, pinning the Nf6. White does have full compensation for the lost pawn.} h6 {Black attacks the bishop.} 13. Nxf6+ {This is what I would have played, although Fritz prefers taking with the bishop followed by 14. d4.} gxf6 {Black naturally recaptures. The doubled f pawns are now a weakness for black, and there are potential weaknesses on the white squares on the black kingside, on f5 and/or h5, but white is never given time to exploit this. The open g file also gives black attacking possibilies for his rook and this is exploited to the full.} 14. Bh4 {Again, I probably would have played this, keeping the pin on the f pawn. Fritz prefers other retreats to e3, d2 or even c1.} Kf8 {Fritz gives 14.....Kf8 as best} 15. Bb3 {Fritz still likes the plan of c3 followed by d4 to blunt the Bc5, Fritz gives the position as equal after 15. c3. Fritz gives 15. Kh2 as the second best move for white.} Rg8 {Fritz also like this move.} 16. Qd2 {Targeting the pawn on h6, not a bad idea at all. Fritz still likes 16. c3 or 16. bd5 to blunt the Bb7.} Rg6 {Naturally black protects the pawn. Black has now come up with the best move on 4 successive moves and now has an advantage of more than plus 1.} 17. Nh2 {Presumably with the idea of Ng4 attacking f6 and h6. Not a bad idea. Fritz prefers 17. Kh1 or Bd5. Unfortunately for black, white finds a strong reply.} Qd7 {This is a powerful counter, threatening to play 18...Qxh6 and the 19....Qxg2 mate. If, say 18.	Ng4	h5 19.	Nxf6	Qxh3 20.	g3 is hopeless for white - black can simply take on h4 or move the Nc6 to e7 to threaten mate on g2 again.} 18. Kh1 {Bravo! White finds the best defence!} Nd4 {But black finds the best move to keep the attack going. There is now a strong threat to g2, attacked by both Bb7 and Rg6. f3 is the only move to keep white in the game.} 19. Ng4 {This is plausible, blocking the g file, the problem is that the Ng4 can be attacked.} h5 {Of course! The obvious move wins easily. Black could have also won with 19....Nf5} 20. Nxf6 {This allows a mate in two, but there wasn't anything much better, for instance 20. Ne3 protects e3 but allows a mate in three -  20.	Ne3	Qxh3+ 21.	Kg1	Rxg2+ 22.	Nxg2	Qxg2# Fritz gives as the best move f3, with advantage to black of over 6 - black position is dire. Ok stop and find a mate in two.} Qxh3+ {There is also another mate in 2 starting with Bg2+} 21. Kg1 {Forced! There are now three mates in one.} Nf3# {Probably the prettiest, although Rxg2 and Qxg2 would also have done the trick. In my view white developed well and had full compensation for the lost pawn, but lost because white failed to find the plan of c3 and d4 blunting the B5. Black played well managing to develop an attack against the white king, even though black never castled. It was one of those games where neither side moves their queen side rook.
