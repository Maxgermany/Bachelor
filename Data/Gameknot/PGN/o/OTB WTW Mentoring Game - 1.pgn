[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C64), classical defence, 4.c3"]

1. e4 {So, I start off with my usual.} e5 {As does my coach.  What I know is that it's going to be a Spanish Opening because I know his style of play, all too well as he taught me the opening.  So, I stick with what I have the most experience with.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Bc5 {?! I'm not surprised that Jack played this against me.} 4. c3 {But, I know to handle it because reversion told me that this is the best response as the plan becomes d2-d4.  The pawn chain is useful.  More importantly, however, is that white gains tempo by attacking black's Bc5.} a6 {But, Jack took me by surprise with this move.  If this were played a move earlier, I would not be taken off guard.  It all goes to show just how intense openings can be.  That is, even the ones that you're most used to, as Ken emphasized in our second training game which was very educational. } 5. Bxc6 {Had Jack played ...a6 right after 3.Bb5, I would've retreated with Ba4.  But, since he attacked after my attack, I thought about the question that Ken asked me.  And, I decided to follow up on it.  His question was if instead of playing Ba4, would I, for once, consider exchanging on c6.  The answer is that with a normal Spanish Opening I have, until I found out that it doesn't accomplish what I thought it did.  Since the only purpose was doubled pawns.  However, Jack took me off guard by playing it later, so my response is also trying to take him off guard.  Therefore, I decided to make that capture, at once.  As I have a plan once he is force to take back, and it's based on the idea of playing 4.c3.} dxc6 6. d4 {That's right.  It's this move, as after we exchange, his Bc5 is attacked.  So, with this extra tempo, I could not be any happier.} exd4 7. cxd4 Bb6 8. O-O {As I castle at once, whereas, Jack doesn't have either side ready to do that, yet.  That's the only thing, though, that makes me happy about my position.  That's because from an instructive dream, I have learned not to become too happy about the position.  As there are things that you might be missing from that.  Instead of being happy, ask yourself what to do.  Well, I did after 5.Bxc6, as I realized that after what you saw, I could castle.  And, that was the plan.} Bg4 {What I overlooked is this nasty, given that my LSB has been removed from the board.  But, it does not bother me because I won't move my Queen.  And, in doing so, Jack won't be able to mess up my K side pawn structures which is where it is most important to prevent the doubled pawn, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  As keeping the K safe is vital.} 9. Nc3 {? As I complete my development.  I thought nothing of the exchange.  But, this is my first mistake because I overlooked that I'm gonna lose pawn.  As I forgot that by Jack exchanging, that same piece was defending the d4 pawn.  And, that defender is gonna be removed which is also something you don't want.  } Bxf3 10. Qxf3 Bxd4 11. Ne2 {Thinking that I could get it back, I decide to go on the offense, by attacking Jack's DSB.  And, when he retreats...} Bf6 12. Be3 {I complete my development, at once.  It's worth noting that I have a short range plan.} Ne7 {I'm not sure why Jack played this.} 13. Rfd1 {But, I follow up on my plan.  And, this was it as after retreating, I try to form a different attack.} Qc8 14. Bc5 {As I am asking myself if there is a way to win back what I had lost.  The N's there, and I'm asking myself what happens if we exchange.  It was later that I realized that there is nothing to win.  So, there is no point in exchanging here.} O-O {Meanwhile, Jack castles.} 15. e5 {And, I attack again.} Bg5 16. Qg3 {And, I continue with my attack.  In other words, I am not relenting. } Qf5 {So, Jack defends.  But, rather then retreat with 16...Bh6, he gets his Q into action.  } 17. f4 {So, I reattack his B, as this will get back the pawn that I lost.  However, I overlooked a critical detail.} Bxf4 18. Nxf4 {As I took back with the N.  I had considered 18.Qxf4 but didn't want to exchange Queens.  As I'm just ready to do that, yet.} Qxe5 {?? This is where Coach Stockel does his money in the bank as I mentioned in comparison to money in the back from elyhim.  This wasn't just a blunder, but rather, Jack intentionally made it to see if I'd follow up with the right response.  It's very important to note, as he told when we were saying goodbye, that it took Mr. Stockel 10 minutes to find this move.  Thus, I should win easily.  How can white win?} 19. Rd7 {?? The logic behind that question is that I overlooked the right move.  And, when I did, Jack did his usual and embarrassed me in front of the other students.  He did this by going back the position right after the previous move (18...Qxe5) when the game was over, and then, asking the same question that I asked.  I am sure that his goal is not to embarrass people.  Instead, his goal is to teach his other students, as there is an important reason this mistake occurred and a lesson affiliated with it.  So, he wants his students to learn.  With that being said, the solution to the problem is 19.Bd4!  As now, with my Qg3 and DSB, I am threatening mate on g7.  Meanwhile, the Queen is threatened, and if Jack is to move that Q, he will get mated.  Of course, not moving it or bringing to f6 (which also prevents mate) will result in 20.BXQ winning the Queen for Bishop.  So, long and short, there would be no way for Jack to protect his Queen.  But, the reason I made this mistake is that, in the wrong context, I tried to apply what ION told me about short range tactics.  As there appears to be two attackers against one defender.  What I overlooked is that his Queen is on the same line as my DSB.  And, being that he captured the pawn which protected my Bc5, Jack can and will capture.  Thus, I am down a piece without compensation.  In part is because when Jack captures I will be in check.  There's even more then what it appears to be, though.  To make matters worse, as per what Ken has asked me before, besides this move, nothing else came into consideration.  The problem is what Jack directly stated to me.  Whereas it took him 10 minutes to find the previous move, it only took me 30 seconds to play this move.  That is exactly why Jack embarrassed me in front of the other students.  The idea was to teach them why you don't rush.  But, that is especially true for the tournament.   Instead of rushing, you should come close to or even use up your time (timeout, lose on time.)  What he told everyone and reemphasized to me is that you must take your time.  As rushing can and often does cause something like this to happen.  } Qxc5+ 20. Kh1 Ng6 {Jack opts to liquidate.} 21. Nd3 {But, being a piece down, I refuse, and instead, attack his Q.  As I realize that white can win a pawn, as one thirds compensation for lost material.  By one thirds compensation, I mean compensating a third of what I lost. } Qf5 {He counterattacks.} 22. Qxc7 {Feeling like I'm getting something back, I take.  That's because instead of being an entire piece down, I now have a pawn, in return.  But, it's certainly enough, though.} Rab8 {As Jack protects.} 23. Re1 {And, I try to get my other Rook into action for a K side assault.} Rfc8 {But, this move proves that it's too little too late.} 24. Qd6 Rce8 {As Jack is trying to exchange Rooks.  With this move, I'm worried about 25...Rxe1+, 26.Nxe1 Qf1#.} 25. g3 {?? But, this loses right away.  Though, being a piece for pawn down, Jack would've won, but it would be a lot more difficult.  In other words, we wouldn't be talking a clear cut win.  But, it is now, as I overlooked something important.  With that being said, much was to move my Re1 off of the e file.} Rxe1+ {What I thought would work here was 26.Nxe1 Qf1+ Kg2  But, what I forgot is that 26...Qf1# is still mate, even with what appeared to be, a window open as Susan Polgar put it.  The other variation which I don't is not recapturing and playing 26.Kg2 (leaving me a R down to which things appeared safe.)  But, he'd mate the same way being 26...Qf1#  So, there's no way around it.  I saw that right after he captured.  Consequently, I resigned here.  As noted, when that happened, that's when Jack went back to what I should've played with the other students.  Then he reminded me of how important it was to take some time.  So, that was one of three morals to this game.  The other one is what Kenneth_fiore_3 has stressed in previous annotations which he directly stated with this game.  So, he told to remember that, "When you see a good, look for something better."  Remembering, though, what that ION said to sometimes play it when you see a good move, I mentioned why I thought it would work before realizing that the Queen was there.  That's when he said, "Why bother with a piece.  Forget about it as you could've won.  Don't go for a piece when you can win the game."  Out of the three morals, I'd say that the first one of taking your time is the most important one.  As this is what happened in some of my other games.  As I went much too fast to see that I could've won.   In fact, while we were saying good bye Jack told me that during those 10 minutes he said to himself that if I found the right move, I'd win.  And, if not, I'd lose, but he was hoping that I would find the winning move which didn't happen.  With that being said had I spent, not even one, but several (at least 5 minutes) I would've seen, and thus, played 19.Bd4!  After which, it would've been game over for Jack, at once.}
