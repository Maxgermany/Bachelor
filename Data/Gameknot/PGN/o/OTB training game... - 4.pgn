1. e4 c5 2. f4 {exactly, what I would have played: steering at the Grand Prix Attack...} g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. g3 e6 5. Bg2 Ne7 6. O-O O-O {all theory...} 7. c3 d5 8. exd5 exd5 9. h3 {against Bg4...} b6 10. g4 {against Nf5...} Bb7 11. d4 Nbc6 12. Be3 {attacking c5...} c4 {practically forced...} 13. Nbd2 {preparing b3...} Qd7 {preparing f5...} 14. Nh2 {defending g4...} Rae8 {Be3 is not covered: Nf5 is imminent...} 15. Bf2 f5 16. Qc2 {both players are fully developed: the game is on...} fxg4 17. Nxg4 Rxf4 18. Bg3 {after the game, White reclaimed that this pawn sac was planned: but he didn't see the next move coming...} Nxd4 19. cxd4 {White cannot afford, to let the Knight live: after Qd1 - Ne2+ is a disaster - might follow Nf5...} Bxd4+ {securing three pawns, for the Knight...} 20. Kh1 {after Bf2, White loses more tempo and Rf4 is off the hook: after Kh2, White runs the risk of more checks; the bottom row is safest for now...} Rxf1+ 21. Rxf1 Nf5 22. Bf2 {forced: square e3 has to be defended against Ne3...} Qd6 {another forcing move: introducing Ng3+: after also Be5, White gets in big trouble...} 23. Bxd4 {so this move is also forced...} Nxd4 {and again, we meet this motif: Ne2 might be next...} 24. Qd1 {White has nothing better...} Ne2 {on the way to g3...} 25. Rf3 {not solving the issue, but forced...} Ng3+ 26. Kg1 {the only one: returning Ne2+ is useless...} b5 {Black has time for preparing d4: but first cover c4...} 27. Rf2 {after d4, Rf3 is attacked: this might just work...} a5 {d4 won't work for now: Bb7 is not covered; so Black plays a silent move...} 28. Bf3 {searching for play: this covers e2...} Bc6 {still pushing for d4: now, the LSB is covered...} 29. Ne4 {Whites' first serious attacking break: after Nxe4, Bxe4, Rxe4, Nf6+, Kg7, Nxe4, Black loses material...} Qf4 {so this is forced...} 30. Nxg3 {Nf6+ is an option: but after Kf7, Nxe8+, Bxe8, there is no attack left...} Qxg3+ 31. Rg2 {White has things in order: for now...} Qd6 {just in time, to secure d5 and prevent Nf6+...} 32. Qd2 {time for White, to start defending...} Rd8 {after d4, Bxc6, Qxc6, d4 is uncovered: so first this...} 33. Qe2 {d4 is unstoppable, so White makes the best of it...} d4 34. Kf2 {no use is Bxc6, Qxc6: so all hands on Bf3...} Bxf3 35. Kxf3 {after Qxf3, Rf8, losing the Queen...} Rf8+ 36. Ke4 {only one...} Qe6+ {also Re8 is winning, but I liked this better...} 37. Ne5 {after Kxd4, Rd8+, White is running mate...} Rf5 {very useful move: also preventing Qh5!...} 38. Kxd4 {forced: all else mates, after Qxe5...} Qd6+ 39. Kc3 {forced...} Rxe5 {reclaiming the piece...} 40. Qg4 {trying to make play: but too incautious...} Re3+ 41. Kc2 Qd3+ 42. Kc1 Re1+ {White has to give the Queen: he complied out of respect...} 43. Qd1 Rxd1# {}
