[Opening "St. George (Baker) defence (B00)"]

1. e4 {So, I start off with my normal.  Of course, I don't know what to expect from Carl with the defenses that he plays since he changes them.} a6 {But, I wasn't used to seeing this because I haven't seen this in a while.  But, I remember something that I forgot, as this is the Alkehine Defense.} 2. Nf3 {?! I start developing here since I go by what I'm most familiar with.  But, I forgot something that I told my student; which was that after 1.e4, with the exception of the Domiano's Defense, when black only advances his pawn one square 2.d4 is usually the best move.  And, that's what I, indeed, should've played to break through in the center.  However, this isn't a mistake, but rather, a small inaccuracy.} Nf6 {I'm not surprised to see Carl play this at all.  As trying to get my e pawn is a good goal, especially when you consider that it's a center pawn.} 3. Nc3 {So, I protect.} d5 {Of course, I still wasn't sure what to expect.  But, after this move, I realized that I had to take to avoid losing a pawn which just welcomed a series of exchanges.} 4. exd5 Nxd5 5. Nxd5 Qxd5 6. d3 {And, with that, I prepare to get ahead in development.  I was, however, thinking about how I could attack the Q and had a small amount of Ghost Vision which almost cost me a piece.  The reason being is that I considered and almost played 6.Bc4?? as I thought here that I had a N on the rim, so a3.  And, this Ghost Vision was caused by me forgetting that my other N had been exchanged.  With that being said, forgetting that was caused by a very small amount of nerves, (a very low level of the Fight or Flight Syndrome), which I quickly exhaled away with my yoga breathes.  And, once that happened, I figured out that this wasn't possible.  So, I decided to open up a line for my Bc1.  Although I'm not visualizing, like I did a while back, I'm starting to think about what my B's would be able to do together.  In particular, although it's way too early for this, I'm just thinking about mating with B bishops, and not with just a B+B endgame checkmate, either, where you only have 2+K against K.  But, my immediate idea of a good time is seeing if there's any way to punish Carl for having his Q out before finishing his development.  Although it's not now, that opportunity may arise.} Bg4 {I'm not surprised to see Carl respond with a pin.  I'd normally just break it aggressively, so with 7.a3.} 7. Be2 {But, I took the more passive approach and not because of what Jack said about how to break a pin like this.  However, I did this to enable castling on the next move.  Usually, I'd delay it, but my thinking is why should I, if I'm not castling into an attack.} Qe6 {And, with that being said, this pin is of no concern since I'm going to castle, right away.} 8. O-O g6 {I'm not surprised to see Carl play this at all.  Similar to me, he enjoys fianchettoing and having long diagonals for his B.} 9. Re1 {And, I respond by centralizing the R.  Of my idea now is trying to figure out how I can launch a discovered attack on the Q.  It's not obvious of how since I was thinking of moving my Nf3 but am not ready to exchange B's.  What I completely forgot about is the fact that 9.Nd4 would attack.  But, I kept it in mind with this move.  And, if Carl isn't careful, I will play that since it would win a piece.} Qf6 {But, Carl is smart that way and prevents the loss of material, but I'm still going on the offense for the gain of a tempo.  My hope was to allure back onto the e file where I will material.  However, I settle for this because my decision to attack his Q was due to it being out before he was able to continue developing, as noted on my 6th move.  I mentioned that I couldn't attack without losing material, but it's about to work, now.} 10. Bg5 Qf5 11. h3 {?? Thinking that the B was trapped, I play this.  I overlooked that it wasn't, and with that, much better would've been to attack again with 11.Nh4!  I forgot that the Q was on the same diagonal as my B, and with that, I would've won an entire piece.  This, however, will allow Carl to liquidate and win a piece for a pawn, instead.} Bxf3 12. Bxf3 Qxg5 13. Bxb7 Ra7 {And, with that, I was thinking very hard about what to do here.  I could retreat back, but my attitude is what ION noted when behind, "Play the man, not the board".} 14. Qf3 {And, with that, I defend by bringing another piece on the same line.  As I felt that I still have a potential threat against Carl.  Wasn't sure if the variations are going to work out; and of course, I'm not going to visualize either since it's important to play in between the lines.  But, it turns out that I will have one which'll be overwhelming, much later on.} Bg7 {Not surprised to see Carl prepare to castle by completing his fianchetto.} 15. Bd5 {And, with that, I target f7, knowing just how critical that square is.  I'm also keeping that my B is protected by my Q.  That might not seem important since it's obvious, but I almost considered anything else besides this move.  And, once I saw that the Q covered the same diagonal, I went for it.  Of course, Carl accurately defends on his next move.} Bf6 16. Bc4 {? And, I pull back so that if ...e6, my B won't be attacked.  Come to think of it, that wasn't a good enough reason for this move since I could always when he does it, but the problem is that I didn't know what else to do, either.  And, with it, it's worth noting that if his N weren't on b8, I would've quick played 16.Bc6+.  But, I'm prepared for what happens after Carl castles, as it is a conditional move.  Yes, it's true that ace-of-aces mentioned that in OTB chess we don't talk about conditional moves.  That's true with everyone, except me.  I do, but by conditional moves; what I mean is that I study and plan out what I'm going to do during the opponents moves in the tournament.  That's also to prevent me from getting nervous and losing with mistakes that shouldn't be made in the tournament.  However, I forgot that this was a mistake that should've allowed black win a pawn.  Better was 16.Rab1.  But, after playing this, when it was Carl's turn, with his Flip Coin Chess, I figured that he'd overlooked this move.  And, what he plays next is what I anticipated which is also why I get into conditional moves for even OTB games since he's known to miss important opportunities like this. } O-O 17. Rab1 {As expected and what I noted above, yes, he missed the opportunity.  And, I asked myself what to do, well, I was going to defend.  Of course, I also considered 17.b3.  But, I refrained from playing that as it would further restrict the mobility of my B.  17.Reb1 also came into consideration, but I like my Re1 where it is since that leaves one R centralized which is important for center control.} Nd7 {Taking all of that into consideration, I was not surprised to see Carl complete his development.} 18. Re4 {But, I have other things on my mind, like attacking his Q, again.} Ne5 {Carl attacks first, but I was ready for it, as I decide to bring my Q behind the R which is known to become useful when we reach the endgame.  The downside, which was unavoidable is liquidation while behind.  But, I knew that I still had chances especially against Carl.  And, the only reason is his fast speed.  Were it against Tom, I would, at least, consider resigning but still wouldn't be ready, yet.  However, I'm generally closer to resigning against him then Carl.  We must remember that similar to TA, I defeated Carl while 2 Rs, and B down.  Of course, up to someones dismay, yes, the first thing I kept in mind there was TA's blitz Q sac on f7 in that game which wasn't a tournament, either.} 19. Qe2 Nxc4 20. Rxc4 c5 {Unlike with other moves I don't know why Carl played this since the pawn isn't passed, yet.  But, similar to how Ken put it in our second training game, I'm going after his Q, regardless.} 21. Rg4 Qe5 {Of course, Carl wants me to further liquidate.  I almost played 22.Qf3, but then I slowed it down and asked myself why I should do that, when I can simply be the aggressor and attack his Q again.  The idea being is that I'm thinking about when a GM would attack his opponents Q.  I'm thinking that now would be the time that they'd do this.} 22. Re4 Qh5 {Not surprisingly, Carl's trying to further liquidate while ahead.} 23. Qe3 {And, I, again, refuse.} Re8 {I don't know why Carl played this since I couldn't take on e7, anyhow.  I would've anticipated 23...Rd8 with the idea of doubling up after 24...Rad7} 24. g4 {But, viewing his last move as pointless, I, again, attack his Q.  Now, I normally wouldn't open up the K like this, but since this is an endgame, we now start thinking about where it would become useful.  I also kept in mind that even if it's a bad idea to open up the monarch, I've got nothing to lose since I'm behind, and of course, playing the man as discussed earlier.  The idea is that the K is known to be a powerful weapon during endgames, it's about when. } Qg5 25. f4 {And, with that being said, I attack, yet, again.} Qd5 26. c3 {? I had thoughts of attacking again with 26.c4 which would've been better since this loses another pawn.  But, my thinking was how to get a passed pawn.  So, with that, the idea behind this move was to allow b4, and after we exchange b4, my pawn on c3 would become passed.  As noted though, I overlook Carl's next move.} Qxa2 27. Re1 {But, after his last move, I was thinking about ways that Carl could still go wrong.  What I'm keeping in mind is that my R was attacked, and that he had a lot more time then me.  Now, that normally makes me nervous as well, and in my first tournament game, caused me to resign.  But, that's not so here because, even though I'm not quite sure, I estimate that Carl has 40 minutes against my 20 or 25.  And, if that's so, Carl only took like 10 minutes.  At the time, I didn't think it was possible to make 20 or 25 moves in only 10 minutes.  But, this opponent has surprised me with his speed.  With that being said, if and when he moves too fast, I'll be prepared to use it against him which will, eventually happen.  And, that's by thinking and talking about conditional moves.  And, it's worth noting that with Tom it's like a regular OTB games, with which, I don't speak of them, as Joe posted in the thread.  In fact, after my third tournament which was against him, a week later, Jack said something about Carl moving too quickly.  With that being said I start here by preparing to exchange pawns which isn't liquidation since the idea is, "exchange pawns, not pieces" especially when behind.  } Qxb2 28. Qxc5 {And, the reason being is due to his Ra7 being under fire.  Of course, his next move was to be expected.} Rd7 29. Qc6 {And, that's when I fork.  What I kept in mind was the nasty pin that grace-augustine had on fiercequeen's right before she resigned which was just as effective here, this time around.   At first, I thought that Carl had no way out of it, but then I figured out that he can.  Had he done so, I'd protect with 29.c4 and would be ready to attack with 30.g5 as then, I'd be trying to figure out a way to safely take on e7.} Rd6 {?? But, I also saw a blunder like this coming which is why I played my last move.  As expected, I timed this one, and it, literally, took Carl 2 seconds to play this move which is why it's Flip Coin Chess since that's how long it takes to flip a coin.  But, this enables me to turn the game around with my next move.  And, with that 29...R7d8 or 29...Red8 were essential.  And, as ION posted in a previous annotation, one blunder often leads another which is also the case here.} 30. Qxe8+ Kg7 31. g5 {And, with that, I attack Carl's B again because of what I can and will do, when he takes.  And, it's more then just exchanging pawns.} Bxc3 32. Re4xe7 {As I also threaten to mate, and this will be very difficult for Carl to drive off.  In fact, that's why I was willing to give up my Re1.  And, that wasn't a blunder, either, but what I'm keeping in mind is that if 32...Bxe1?? I would, immediately, respond with 33.Qxf7+ where it would, obviously, be mate in 2.} Qb6+ {Of course, Carl sees why I'm doing this and tries to stop it with this intermediate check which will only hold off for a few moves.} 33. Kh2 Qb3 {And, that's why Carl also puts his Q on the same diagonal.  But, I'm still going to check there.  However, I'll use my R, instead because when he takes, I see an opportunity to win his Q when it's turn to move, talk about conditional moves since as noted, this will be the equivalent to that.} 34. Rxf7+ Qxf7 35. Re7 {And, that is why I played this, as opposed to, 35.Qe7.  Instead of exchanging, Carl can't avoid losing his Q, even after his next move.} Rf6 36. gxf6+ {As I simply take here.} Bxf6 37. Qxf7+ {With that also being said, I almost responded with 37.Rxf7+, but I felt that Carl would have a way out of mate.  And, despite being way behind, he'd have a chance to win on time, as I'm not sure, but if I remember correctly, I only had 6 minutes remaining against, I believe it was, his 25.  But, with this move, he has no chance of even winning on time, as now, black is only left with 2 moves with his.  The reason for this emphasize is even though I wasn't mate, I was clearly winning against Mariann and was up the equivalent to the Q but lost on time which as ION noted in a different annotation once happened to him being up more then a Q, 11 points.  Well I wasn't about to let that happen, so after Carl's next move, it only took me fraction of a second to deliver the checkmate} Kh6 38. Qxh7# {}
