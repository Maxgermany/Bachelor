1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {So far mainstream Open Sicilian} 6. f3 {This is a bit unusual.} e5 {So I strike out in the centre.} 7. Nb3 {Knight retreats.} Be6 {I prevent him from playing 8. Bc4} 8. Bg5 {He pins the knight.} Be7 {I unpin} 9. Qd2 {Seems to be preparing to castle queen-side.} h6 {So I hit the bishop. Now Bh4? is met with Nxe4! winning a pawn. I expected him to drop back to e3.} 10. Bxf6 {But he took.} Bxf6 {I took back. Now of course 0-0-0 is met with Bg5! winning his queen.} 11. Nb5 {So he plays this. After the game we looked at this position on Fritz and it seems black can just give up his weak d pawn with 0-0 and have compensation in better development. Later still I saw that in this position 11....0-0 was played in Rodriguez, Andres (2475) vs. Scarella, Enrique Alejandro (2380)	which ended in a draw http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x698505&fb=1&mv=21&rnd=0.19866226531272724} Ke7 {But I chose a different course.} 12. Rd1 {Adding another attack} Bxb3 {So I took the knight.} 13. axb3 {He takes back.} Nd4 {And I make sure he can't safely take my d pawn.} 14. c3 {he attacks my knight - OK find black's next move.} Bh4+ {Did you find it? If g2-g3 then Nf3 forking king and queen. White resigns.  Many thanks for reading. Please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing.
