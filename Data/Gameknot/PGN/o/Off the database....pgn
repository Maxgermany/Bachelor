[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01)"]

1. b3 {This is ok.} c6 {This is even stranger, but still comprehensible.} 2. Bb2 Nf6 3. d3 Qb6 {A "naive" attack. } 4. f4 {This helps me a lot, I admit it...} Ng4 {Curiosely, I was planning just this.} 5. Nh3 Ne3 6. Qd2 {I have to be careful. d5 makes me retreat the knight.} Qc5 {Threating f7, which leads to...} 7. Na3 {So: black is undeveloped, with a flying queen. But white has two knights on the worst place. } Nd5 {Time to be responsible. f4 was not a bad square, but from this one I keep an eye on f5. Of course it blocks my own central advance pawn.} 8. d4 {This is ok, because it blocks his own bishop (you'll see it useless for a lot of moves, until I blunder and it wins the game). } Qb4 {I cannot lose more time swinging the queen all around... but if f6, I'll have to do it. Qh4, etc. } 9. e4 {No way: } Qxd2+ 10. Kxd2 {So white has an impressive center, etc. Ok. } Nb6 {Nc3 only granted him a tempo after e4. And Ne5+ is not interesting. } 11. Bd3 d5 12. e5 {This is ok, because now the white's dsb is really useless. But I don't want to be "squeezed" after e3. On the other side, BxNa6 doubles his pawns, but provides him with a semiopen column.} Bg4 {Maybe it was ok BxN anyway. } 13. Nf2 h5 {This was the plan. I lose the "good bishop", ok, but I have the semiopen column. Anyway, this "good" bishop had few places to go, since white can play f4 at any time.} 14. c4 {Wow! white is pawnstorming... } e6 {But I am catching up with developement, and I am "closing" the game. } 15. c5 {...he closes it more and more!} Nc8 {No problem. My knight can redeploy very well via e2 and f4. This is ok on a closed game, isn't it?} 16. h3 {Well, I was waiting for it. } Bf5 {Accepting BxB and the potential e pawn's advance. But no choice. } 17. g4 {!? Well, thank you!} Bxd3 18. Nxd3 Ne7 {F4 is still good for white, I sense. I think that neither axb5 nor a5 were good. axb5, axb5, RxR, RxR, and I have to go b3 to cover h1, but I don't come with Bb2 on time. It is better to wait for him to exchange - which he won't do, of course. } 19. Nc2 Nd7 20. Ne3 {His knight redeployment were better than mine. } g6 {I don't like it, but I have to free my dsb. The choice was f3, and it was probably better. } 21. Raf1 {of course, f4 is the white's progress in sight. } f5 22. gxf5 Nxf5 {The alternative, gxf4, makes my position really squeezed. I guessed NxN, gxN, and we are more or less ok. } 23. Rhg1 Kf7 {The other plan was to castle, and defend it with pieces. But this plan is better. } 24. Ne1 {More knight's redeploying. } Bh6 {Now, I think that Be2 was a better plan. } 25. Kd3 h4 {This was a mistake, but I was with no plan. } 26. Rg4 Ng3 {With this idea in mind. } 27. Rg1 Rag8 {Nf4 just leads to NxN and Rxh5.} 28. Nf3 Nh5 {Thireatening f5... } 29. Ng2 {...but this one covers all. I couldn't "untangle" me, finally... :-(} Nf8 {At least my knight has a purpose... better than nothing.} 30. Nfxh4 g5 {Looking for some space, but bad. } 31. fxg5 Bg7 32. Rf1+ Ke7 33. Nf3 Ng6 34. Bc1 {The only plan was Bf1, Nb2 and Nf4, exploiting a6's weakness... but not very appealing. } Rgf8 35. Nh2 Rxf1 36. Nxf1 Rf8 37. Ke2 {Here I was on a serious time deficit, and I blundered. Anyway, a fun game because of the opening. Hope you enjoyed it. } Nhf4+ 38. Bxf4 Nxf4+ 39. Nxf4 {}
