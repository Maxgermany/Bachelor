[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 c5 {as always, Sicilian on the menu...} 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 Bg7 {the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian: White has played an early d4, to challenge c5; Black does not seem to be bothered...} 4. Nc3 cxd4 {until now: after dxc5, Qa5+, will always recapture the gambit pawn c5; but not anymore...} 5. Nxd4 a6 {Black wants to play e6: but first we need to avoid Nb5, possibly followed by Nd6+; that would ruin Blacks' setup...} 6. Be2 {preparing castling...} e6 7. O-O Ne7 {still following the Hungarian variation...} 8. f4 {a proper move...} d5 {thematic in any Sicilian: an outbreak of d5, to reshuffle the center...} 9. exd5 exd5 10. Be3 b5 {Black is finalizing the main setup...} 11. a4 {seems like a logical move...} Bb7 {covering Ra8...} 12. axb5 O-O {the right moment to castle: we do not want a Bishop on b5...} 13. Na4 {searching for ways, to untangle the Queens' wing...} Nd7 {conveniently covering c5 and b6...} 14. b4 Nf5 {a disturbance: Be3 is uncovered, and Nxf5, fails on Bxa1...} 15. Bf2 {probably safest...} Qf6 {putting on the heat: after Nxf5, Qxa1, Qxa1, Bxa1, yields the same result...} 16. c3 Rfe8 {preparing Ne3...} 17. Nxf5 {White has to release some tensions...} Qxf5 18. Nc5 Nxc5 19. Bxc5 Bxc3 20. Rc1 Bg7 {the smoke has cleared...} 21. Bd3 Qd7 22. Qa4 {trying to invade Blacks' Queens wing...} axb5 23. Qxb5 Qxb5 24. Bxb5 Re4 25. Rce1 d4 26. Rxe4 Bxe4 {Black has come up with a clever way, to preserve a free pawn...} 27. Rd1 Ra2 {another disturbance: White has to react...} 28. Bf1 d3 {this is getting uneasy for White: interference from Bg7 is only a matter of time...} 29. b5 {so White decides to run for it...} Rb2 {relentless...} 30. Bxd3 {again, White has to release the tensions...} Bxd3 31. Rxd3 Rxb5 32. Bd6 Bb2 {the object is simple: Black wants to retain control over the dark diagonal, as long as possible; this rules out checks, from the White DSB...} 33. Kf2 Kg7 34. Kf3 {getting away from the dark squares...} f6 {outplaying Whites' DSB altogether: Black is preparing to bring the King into play; Whites' only threat might be Re3, followed by Re7+...} 35. g4 Kh6 {the break Black needed...} 36. h4 f5 37. g5+ {getting impatient...} Kh5 38. Kg3 {forced...} Bc1 {preparing to give f4 a hard time...} 39. Rd1 {so this is very dangerous...} Rb3+ {a nasty check...} 40. Kg2 {Kf2 is asking for more trouble, after Be3+...} Rc3 {the winning move: White cannot allow Kxh4...} 41. Rh1 {so this is forced...} Kg4 {closing the last gaps: White is running mate, so he resigned...}
