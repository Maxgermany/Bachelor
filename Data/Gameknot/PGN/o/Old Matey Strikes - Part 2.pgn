[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C64), classical defence, 4.c3"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Bc5 {3. ....................... Bc5 - an unusual response to the Ruy Lopez.  This could lead to a variation called the Benelux which is rather sharp.} 4. c3 d6 5. O-O Nge7 6. d4 exd4 7. cxd4 a6 {7. ............ a6?? - after some pretty standard developing moves black makes a bad error costing him a piece through the following sequence.} 8. Bxc6+ Nxc6 9. dxc5 O-O 10. cxd6 cxd6 {10. ........... cxd6 - I then exchange pawns on d6 ensuring that I will be a clear piece up.} 11. Nc3 Bg4 12. a3 {12. a3 - preventing Nb4.} Rc8 13. Qd3 {13. Qd3 - breaking the annoying pin on g4.} Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Nd4 15. Qd1 {15. Qd1 - black decided to exchange on f3 - I was pleased with that because as I am a piece up I will need to exchange pieces to simplify to a won ending.  This queen retreat drives back the black knight.} Ne6 16. Be3 Re8 17. Nd5 {17. Nd5 - making use of an outpost on d5 - d5 is a really good square for a knight according to Kasparov as it controls many central squares.} a5 18. Bb6 Qg5 19. Bxa5 Rc5 20. Bc3 {20. Bc3 - black makes a further error on move 17 by playing his pawn up to a5 - this allowed me to win this pawn by a bishop fork on b6.  Black could have the beginnings of a mating attack on my kingside position so I cannot afford to be complacent here.} h5 21. Qf3 Rc4 22. Qg3 {22. Qg3 - again I take nearly 2 days to make this decision.  The queen exchange is forced.  If the queen retreats then an exchange-winning knight fork will come on f6 as the g7 pawn is pinned.  This will allow black to win his pawn back and my kingside pawn structure will be slightly compromised but as I am still a piece up this exchange is desirable.} Qxg3 23. hxg3 Rxe4 24. Rfe1 {24. Rfe1 - contesting the e file.  Black must either back off his rook or exchange on e1.  If he exchanges on e1, that suits me down to the ground.  If he does not then I can perhaps force an exchange of knights due to a pin down the e file.} Rc4 25. Nf4 g6 {25. .......... g6 - decides to back up his h pawn but I find another way to win material - the d pawn must now fall after I move my rook to d1.} 26. Rad1 Nxf4 {26. .............. Nxf4?? - disaster, disaster, disaster!  Not only does this allow me to swipe a rook, but I took one look at h8 - it's mate in two!!} 27. Rxe8+ {27. Rxe8 !! As black has only 1 legal move, Kh7, he can either resign or allow mate next move.  I set up 28. Rh8# as a conditional move, look at my watch and decide that it is now time for me to go to the work's canteen for lunch and then take a short walk outside as it was a lovely sunny day.  As my opponent was still on-line I knew that I would come back to my desk and receive a gameknot message telling me that I have delivered mate or at the very least received a white flag!  When I returned to my desk Gameknot sent me this message "Game Won (Checkmate), Congratulations!  I then went and did some filing in excellent spirits knowing that my rating was within 4 points of my highest provisional rating, 1695.  My current rating to date is 1691 and I have scored 20.5 points out of 32 games from my 3 mini-tournaments put together.  Nice.} Kh7 28. Rh8# {}
