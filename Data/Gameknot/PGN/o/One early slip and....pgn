1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 {White has a particular reason for this second move: He aims to steer the game into a specialist line known as the Jackal Attack.} d5 3. Nc3 c5 {The main alternatives are 3...d4 or 3...Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4 c5 6.Bg5!? - the sharp main line analysed in the Jackal Attack ebook.} 4. exd5 exd5 5. Bb5+ Nc6 6. O-O {A good alternative which is more usually played is 6.d4. The ebook however concludes that immediate castling is fractionally better and is a very useful waiting move: White gets time to have a look at how Black intends to deploy his minor pieces. A game, [Llaneza [2455] - Martinez [2403]; Madrid 2007], illustrates how just a single slip can quickly lead Black into difficulties. That game continued 6.O-O Be7 7.d4 a6 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Ne5 Bb7. [The bishop is clearly not well placed here. But, after, say, 9...Qd6,  either 10.Re1 or 10.Bf4 will give White an ongoing initiative. 10.dxc5 Bxc5 11.Qg4 g6 12.Re1 Be7 13.Bg5 Qc8 14.Qd4 f6 15.Ng4 c5 16.Rxe7 was a blow that Black could not recover from. The game concluded 16...Kxe7 17.Bxf6 Nxf6 18.Qxf6 Kd7 19.Ne5 Kc7 20.Nf7 Rd8 21.Qf4 Kc6 22.Nxd8 Qxd8 23.Re1 Bc8 24.Re8! Qd7 25.Qf6 Resigns  } Bg4 {[?] A tempting but a serious mistake: White will now either net a pawn or gain a strong attack. Black's problems  multiply because of the open nature of the position and the accelerated development of White's minor pieces.} 7. Qe1+ {[!] The check breaks the pin and allows the knight to get to e5 with tempo.} Be7 {The move 7...Ne7 causes a traffic jam amongst the Black pieces and after 8.Ne5 Be6 White can gain the advantage with the simple 9.d3 or immediate 9.f4 when Black is still a few moves from a safely castled king.  The further advance of the f-pawn can cause serious problems.} 8. Ne5 Bd7 9. Nxd5 {Nothing goes Black's way now: In this position for example, after the relatively best 9...Nxe5 10.Qxe5 Bxb5 11.Nc7+ Kf8 12.Nxb5 leaves White with extra material and his opponent unable to develop normally.} Nf6 {Black is naturally anxious to develop and get his king off the e-file. But although now just one move away from castling - it  never happens. With no immediate mate available to the attacker, the general strategy in these positions is to trade off pieces and/or to cause as much damage as possible to the enemy pawn structure. } 10. Nxf6+ gxf6 11. Bxc6 {Relatively best would be the recapture on c6 but Black's position is  already losing in any case.} fxe5 12. Qxe5 f6 {Effectively resigning. White can force mate from here. After 12...Rg8 13.Bxb7 Black is three pawns down.} 13. Qh5+ Kf8 14. Bd5 Kg7 15. Qf7+ Kh6 16. d4# {}
