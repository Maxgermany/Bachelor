[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {The Scandinavian, or, more descriptively, the Centre-Counter Defence.  I don't have very good memories of this opening, having been taught a lesson with it by Jovanka Houska in a Rapid Play game a few years ago.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 {?!  I think book is 3. d4 to prevent Black's next move, but it works out OK for me.} Qe5+ {Causing me to have to waste time thinking about how best to block the check, bearing in mind that ...Bg4 has often caused me grief in this opening.} 4. Be2 c6 {This contests control of d5 and provides a bolt hole for the adventurous Queen.} 5. Nf3 Qc7 6. h3 {As mentioned before, ...Bg4 has given me grief in past games against the Scandinavian, so I decided to prevent it.} Bf5 {This is beginning to look like a Caro-Kann, another opening against which I struggle, as Black presents few targets for attack..} 7. d4 {I didn't want to castle too early as this would enable Black to point everything at my King.  This move contests the centre and enables my QB to develop.} e6 8. Be3 Nf6 9. Bd3 {Under no pressure to castle yet, I make a second move with the KB to put the question to Black's annoying B.} Bg6 {Now, if White swaps on g6, Black gets doubled pawns but also a half-open file to exploit with a rook or two, so I don't take immediately but ...} 10. O-O {... castle.  Now, if Black wants to swap Bishops, I can either retake with my Q, connecting my rooks or accept the doubled pawns in return for a half-open file down which to attack Black's Queen.} Bd6 {This is a strong attacking position for this Bishop, supported as it is by the Q on c7 but it doesn't actually threaten anything serious.} 11. Re1 {Lining up on Black's uncastled King, hoping to be able to play something like 12. d5 exd5 13. Bb6+.  That would obviously be too good to be true but thinking about it gave me other attacking ideas.  I expected Black to castle immediately, which would have suited me because I thought he was probably planning .... 0-0-0, so I would have been satisfied at foiling his (supposed) plan.} Nbd7 {This surprised me and confirmed in my mind that he was planning Queenside castling.  From my point of view, I didn't really mind which way he went as my pieces ere centrally placed to attack on either wing but if he did want to castle long, I wanted to frustrate him, so...} 12. d5 {!  After the game, my opponent congratulated me on this sacrifice, which enabled me to generate considerable pressure.  As previously noted, it exploits the uncastled position of Black's king to gain tempi.} Nxd5 13. Nxd5 {Swapping this N off clears the path for my c-pawn to advance and for a rook to line up against Black's Q, which would be especially dangerous if Black castled long and his c-pawn had cleared off to the d-file.} cxd5 14. Rc1 Bxd3 {Surprising timing as White is looking to clear the c-file anyway.} 15. cxd3 Qa5 {The Queen goes to the rim, where she is less powerful, but does attack White's a-pawn.  White also has to be careful about abandoning the defence of the Rook on e1.  Yesterday's Guardian featured a nice finish by Bronstein which exploited the fact that all Black's pieces were over on the Queenside, including the Q on a5.  I wish I'd seen it before I played this game!} 16. a3 O-O {Finally Black castled.  Now, if I'd seen Bronstein's game, I'd undoubtedly have launched an all-out assault on Black's castled King.  I thought about trying to build up such an attack but decided it would be too easy to repel, so continued with my strategy of pressuring Black and exploiting the open c-file.} 17. d4 {Played to stop Black's N from coming to c5 or e5 and to allow my Q to use d3.} Rac8 18. Qd3 {Connects the rooks.  I spent some time thinking about 18. Qd2 but decided that, a pawn down, I didn't want to swap Queens yet.} Rc7 {Clearly, Black is preparing to double on the c-file but this deprives his Q of a retreat square, so now I follow Freddy's example and pile on the pressure, again to foil Black's plans.} 19. b4 {This is now possible with the a3 pawn defended by my Q.} Qb6 20. Ne5 {This prevents 20...Rfc8 because of the attack on the Nd7: 20...Rc8 21. Nxd7 Rxd7 22. Rxc8+} Nf6 {also, ...Nxe5 or ...Bxe5 would have allowed dxe5, attacking the Q on b6, which had nowhere sensible to go.} 21. Rxc7 {?! Again stops Black doubling but, the more I swap off without regaining my pawn, the worse my position gets.  This was just about the highwater mark of my game.  Black gets the upper hand after this.} Qxc7 22. Rc1 Qb8 {Now I wanted to play 23. Bg5 to take on f6 and follow up with the fork on d7.  Unfortunately the N on e5 was under attack, so that would have lost a pawn.} 23. Bf4 Rc8 24. Rxc8+ {?! A failure of imagination.  I should perhaps have avoided this swap by 24. Re1 but I didn't want to cede control of the c-file.} Qxc8 25. g4 {Played to prevent Nh5 and possibly advance later.} Bxe5 26. Bxe5 {Better than 26. dxe5, which would have given Black a protected passed pawn.} Ne4 {A great outpost for The Dark Knight.} 27. Kg2 {Getting the King off the back row and keeping the King several Knight moves away from a Knight check.} a6 {! Prevents 28. Qb5, which I had been planning in order to keep Black's Queen on the back row, at least till he'd created luft for his own King.} 28. b5 Qc3 {!  Virtually forcing the most important swap of all.  If White doesn't swap, Black gangs up on f2 or nicks the a3 pawn.} 29. Qxc3 Nxc3 30. bxa6 bxa6 31. Bd6 f6 32. Kf3 Nb5 33. Bc5 e5 {Black hastens to create a passed pawn.  I knew I was heading for defeat now.  It was just a question of playing for time and a lucky chance.  I had about half an hour left, my opponent a quarter: plenty yet to force a win.} 34. dxe5 fxe5 35. Ke3 Kf7 36. f3 Ke6 37. Kd3 Kd7 38. a4 Nd6 39. h4 Kc6 40. Ba7 {I felt I had to stay on the a7-g1 diagonal to protect my a-pawn.  Retreating to e3 or f2 would have allowed Black to cut the B off from that task by ...d4.} g6 41. Bf2 {But now I was equally worried about the possibility of being trapped at a7 ....} e4+ 42. fxe4 Nxe4 43. Bd4 Nc5+ {!} 44. Bxc5 {?  As Black said after the game, White had to keep the Bishop on even at the expense of going another pawn down.} Kxc5 {Now, as the books say, it's just a matter of technique.} 45. Kc3 d4+ 46. Kb3 a5 47. h5 g5 48. h6 Kd5 49. Kc2 Ke4 50. Kd2 d3 51. Ke1 {? It no longer really matters but this is a mistake.  If I want to prevent the pawn from queening, I should retreat to d1.  As it happens, Black can give up the d-pawn to capture the g-pawn and queen his own g-pawn but this move allows Black to force home the d-pawn.} Ke3 52. Kd1 d2 {and I offered my hand as 53. Kc2 Ke2 wins for Black.}
