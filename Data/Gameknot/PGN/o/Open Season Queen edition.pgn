[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {Queen pawn opening. A bit interesting, I suppose. Normally I see e4, but this is equally good.} Nf6 {To stop e4. } 2. d5 e6 {Feeling a bit under pressure. I've never had a game where the queen pawn went so far forward.} 3. c4 d6 {Constrained. White is able to move his pieces around quite easily, but I am now unable to develop my bishops and knights where I want them. Would there have been a better move than d6 to allow that?} 4. Nc3 a6 {I don't want that knight coming down to b5. I'm constrained enough as it is.} 5. e4 e5 6. Be2 Be7 {Getting ready to castle kingside. Too much pawn movement on the queenside to justify a castle there.} 7. Nf3 Bd7 8. Be3 Ng4 {Asking for a trade.} 9. Bd2 {But he declines. Well, at least my knight is pressuring him.} c6 {Not exactly sure why I made this move, but I certainly am glad I did. It will be revealed why later.} 10. a4 O-O 11. Qb3 Qe8 {Blunder on my end. Failed to notice that b7 was unguarded, and that White's queen was sitting pretty on b3, ready to take both a pawn and a rook.} 12. Qxb7 {And my rook is gone on the next move. } Qc8 {I think I did this hoping he'd go for a trade. However, this move is incredibly important because of what it does to White's queen if it happens to take the rook: its escape route will be cut off (a6 will be guarded by the queen). } 13. Qxa8 c5 {Traps the queen in! } 14. Qa7 {Still, the queen can't escape. My pawns block her way. It's hunting time!} Bd8 {Just some support here if I need it.} 15. h3 Nf6 16. Ng5 {Seems to pressure me here. I want to be very cautious here, however. Any other pieces that break through could help the queen. So I decide to drive the knight away with a conservative pawn push on h6.} h6 17. Nf3 Nh5 18. g3 Be8 {I notice that I can use my knight only if d7 is open. If I can get him there, I'll be able to threaten Bb6, which would gain me a queen.} 19. Rb1 Nd7 20. a5 {Curses! He saw it, forcing me to...} Bxa5 {delay my capture of the queen. But hey, a free pawn nonetheless. } 21. Na4 {Just what I was worried about! The knight is coming to help out the queen! I have to be very careful with my moves now, I don't want to let the queen escape from my trap.} Bc7 {I'm being very conservative.} 22. Bd1 Ndf6 {I need that knight to get out of here, so I threaten to trade with my bishop.} 23. Bc2 Bxa4 24. b3 {?? I was confused. Why didn't White take my bishop? This seems like a huge blunder to me. He just lost a knight for nothing!} Be8 {I retreat, although perhaps the better move would have been Nd7 to threaten the queen trap. What do you think?} 25. b4 Nd7 26. Be3 {Hoping to break through c5, I suppose, but it is too late.} Bb6 {And the queen is toast! Nothing White can do will save her queen. } 27. Qxb6 Nxb6 {Up by 4 points in material, but if it weren't for that blunder on move 24, it would only be one.} 28. bxc5 Nxc4 29. cxd6 {What is more valuable, the pawn on d6 or the bishop trade on e3?} Nxe3 {I decide for the bishop trade. I need to press my advantage, and this opens up a threat for Qxc2. } 30. fxe3 Qxc2 {Up by 6 now. With White's queen gone, the maneuverability of White's forces has dropped significantly.} 31. Rd1 Qxe4 {Threaten the knight capture.} 32. Ke2 Nxg3+ {Basic knight fork here.} 33. Kf2 Nxh1+ 34. Rxh1 {Now, the lead is by 10 points in material. White simply cannot catch up at this point, barring a pawn promotion that I allow to happen, which would be a huge blunder on my side.} Qxd5 35. Ra1 Qxd6 {Grinding down White's forces, little by little.} 36. Nxe5 Qxe5 37. Rxa6 {At this point, White resigns. With a bonus queen, bishop, and a pawn, there simply is nothing White can do. Ultimately, the way I saw it, is that this game was lost on move 24. If White had taken my bishop rather than pushed a pawn, he would have been able to stop Kd6 to support Bb6. His queen would have remained alive a while longer while he may have figured out a way to save it. But in the end, the queen trap worked, and White was whittled down piece by piece by piece.
