[Opening "English opening (A20)"]

1. c4 {The good old English Opening - non-committal and devious.} e5 {Along with 1...c5 and 1...Nf6, one of the more popular responses.  There are several other playable lines...} 2. g3 {Thematic and good.  Slightly more usual is 2.Nc3, but this type of opening is rather forgiving of deviations in move order.} Nf6 3. Bg2 Bc5 {Playable, but the strike at f2 is rather too easily blocked by e2-e3, a move White is planning anyway.  Afterwards, the bishop might become a target, though it transpires that Black has something to say about that...} 4. a3 {Thematic (much as it is on the Black side of a Sicilian, which opening this resembles with colours reversed), planning a Q-side expansion, striking at the c4-bishop.  The move could have waited until after 4.e3, but it seems fine here.} a5 {Strategically well motivated , allowing Black to maintain the bishop at c5 for quite a while longer.  However probably more active for Black are moves like 4...0-0 or 4...d5.} 5. e3 c6 {Apparently to support a pawn advance to d5 or possibly b5.  Maybe priority ought to be given to development, but it's hard to criticise the move overmuch.} 6. Ne2 {Fine, but 6.d4 was also good.} O-O {Also part of Black's programme.  But having played ...c6 last turn, maybe 6...d5 was indicated here, freeing up the Q-side, and getting in his strike at the centre ahead of White.} 7. d4 {Thematic.  After exchanges Black will have to retire the bishop from the a7-g1 diagonal, losing time.  } exd4 8. exd4 Be7 9. O-O h6 {(?) In openings of this type, development is often slow, but Black begins seriously to neglect his Q-side pieces.  He had no reason to fear a bishop landing on g5, as then he could hit it with ...h6 (10.Bg5 h6 11.Bh4?? g5).  } 10. Nbc3 d6 {Good, freeing the Q-side.  10...d5 also looks playable.} 11. b3 {Supporting the c-pawn, and preparing to occupy the long dark diagonal with a bishop.  All the same, Black could now have developed a bishop usefully at f5.  11.Qd3 or 11.Qc2 would have prevented this, for what it's worth...} Nh7 {(?) Very strange.  The sequel shows the reason for the move, but if Black wants to attack White's K, his available resources look very slender.  11...Bf5 looks fine.} 12. Bb2 {Or 12.Qc2/Qd3...} f5 {(?!) Aggressive!  Has he enough for attack?  His bishops are aimed at the K-side, and this pawn threatens to advance to open the f-file.  But White's resiources for attack seem to be the greater.  Meanwhile, Black has weakened himself very seriously on the light squares about his King - a consequence not lost on White!  Instead, 12...Bf5 was still playable, with a reasonable game.} 13. Re1 {Centralizing and building up for an attack.  13.Nf4 at once, threatening to continue to g6 was an alternative...} Bf6 {The Black Q-side pieces are left tapping their feet, but maybe Black already has little time to spare for them.  13...g5 looks very weakening, but it does have a couple of points: keeping the e2-knight out of f4, and - well, you never know - that pawn array might turn into a pawn storm yet!} 14. Nf4 Re8 15. Qc2 {(!?) As it turns out, White had an even better move 15.Ncd5!!  Among other things, this move threatens 16.Rxe8  Qxe8 17.Nc7, picking up a rook.  After 15...Rxe1  16.Qxe1, Black dare not play 16...cxd5, owing to 17.Bxd5  with a terrific attack.  More on this motif later...} Bxd4 {What else?  id=mokru suggested that had black played 15...g5 he would have tried 16.Nh5.  Looks good: let's see what might have happened.  [A] 16...Rxe1  17.Rxe1 Bxd4 18.Nb5! Bxb2 19.Qxb2 Qd7 (...Qf8 20.Re8!) 20.Nxd6; or [B] 16...Bxd4 17.Nd5! Bxb2 {or 17...cxd5 18.Bxd5  ( -)} 18.Qxb2, threatening mate on g7 and the win of Black's Q by 19.Rxe8  Qxe8 20.Nhf6  Nxf6 21.Nxf6  etc.  Black's best chance seems to be [C] 16...Bh8.  Now the sac on d5 doesn't look so promising.  Maybe White has to build up further by 17.d5 , opening the dark-square diagonal towards the BK.  A possible continuation is 17...Be5!? 18.Na4 Bd7 (trying to develop) 19.c5 and Black's centre is just barely holding .... for now.} 16. Ncd5 {(!?) I'd like to give this a (!), but it would probably have been better a move earlier!  More immediately forcing is 16.Qd3 e.g. 16...Be5 17.Bd5 ! cxd5 18.Qxd5  Be6 19.Nxe6 Qd7 20.Ng5  Kf1 (else he can kiss his queen goodbye) 21.Nxh7  Ke7 22.f4.  Even so, after the text move, you can tell by the creaking that Black's position is under enormous pressure.} Rxe1+ {Sensible.  16...Be5 17.Ng6 or, better yet, 17.c5! don't look healthy for Black.  Instead 16...Bxb2 17.Qxb2 Bd7 (say, to defend against the threat of Rxe8 , bearing in mind that one of the points of the Ncd5 move was the prospect of a fork on c7) 18.Rxe8  Bxe8 19.Ne6 Qd7 20.Re1 (+/-; e.g. 20...cxd5 21.Bxd5 Nf6 22.Nc5  etc.  The situation has become fiendishly complicated, but all the complications seem to favour White.} 17. Rxe1 Bxb2 18. Qxb2 cxd5 {(??) Loses at once, but even after the better 18...Nf6, Black is under intolerable pressure after 19.Re7: the threat is 20.Nxf6  etc, but the knight can't move as it is pinned against g7.} 19. Bxd5+ {White has a forced mate...} Kf8 {(??) shortening the agony.  19...Be6 prolonged the game several moves: 20.Bxe6  Kf8  21.Ng6  Ke8 22.Qxg7 Qf6 (Black might as well make White work - material is still close to even) 23.Bxf5  Kd8 24.Qxb7 and there are too many threats (25.Qc8#, and if 24...Na6 25.Qd7# or 24...Qxf5 25.Re8  Kxe8 26.Qe7#).} 20. Ng6# {An economical mate with minor pieces and the rook.  To the end of the game Black's Q-side pieces never stirred.  It  sometimes happens that development deferred overlong becomes development cancelled.  A fine game by White.}
