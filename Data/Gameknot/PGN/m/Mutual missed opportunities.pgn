1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Is Bc4 stronger for White?} d6 4. Bxc6+ {The piece trade here seem premature. Why not more development, or perhaps castling?} bxc6 5. d3 e5 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. a3 Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. g4 {White, still not castled, now weakens his king side pawns for no apparent advantage.} Bg6 10. g5 {White's aggression seems aimless while his development still lags.} Nh5 {Black, rather than retreat, looks towards posting the N at f4.} 11. h4 {What was accomplished here? The g5 pawn is already doubly protected. White uses a tempo to further extend his King side pawns...} Be7 {Black uses the tempo to prepare a safe harbor for his King.} 12. O-O {? White chooses to castle to the weakened King side. Better perhaps was Be3.} O-O {Securing a well defended spot for the King.  Black seems somewhat cramped but better positioned perhaps than his opponent.} 13. Nh2 {Opening an attack on the N at h5 and seeking to tie down the B.} Qc8 {PLacing the Q on a long diagonal leading to White's exposed King.} 14. Kg2 {The King himself defends agains Q h3. Still, a shaky position for White...} f5 {Black attacks the passage for his B to the h3-c8 diagonal, seeking tto clear the way for an eventual B 3 , winning the f1 R.} 15. f4 {White doens't bite. 15... Pxe4 is useless for Black, since he will still end with a pesky pawn on e4 after the exchange.} fxe4 {Now black presses on, focusing on a different route by opening the f file to his R.} 16. Nxe4 {16. Pxe4 may be better as it maintains a guard against 16... Bf5.} Bf5 {Black abandons the N to focus on attacking White's exposed King. But after 17. Qxh5 Bh3  18. Kg1 Bxf1 19. Kxf1 White comes out a point ahead. 19... Qh3  is no help to Black as the then unsupported Q is only a small threat.} 17. Kg1 {White eschews, or overlooks the advantages of Qxh5 and seeks to save the f1 R.} Bh3 18. Rf2 d5 {Black seeks to trade Ns rather than defend h5.} 19. Qxh5 g6 {20. Nf6  is no real threat, as after 20...Bxf6, White still has to use a move to get the Q to safety and cannot end by trading one piece for 2.} 20. Qf3 {Retreating and attacking the B at h3.} dxe4 {Completing teh N exchange started 2 moves earlier.} 21. dxe4 {White leads by a point and has equal space, yet his King seems exposed.} exf4 {Regaining equality in material but blocking his own R on the f file...} 22. Bd2 {A weak move, wasting another tempo.  Why not 22. Bxf4, clearing more space for the B and gaining a pawn?} c4 {A move that requires scrutiny. Why a flank move by a doubled pawn at this time? Clearly to open the path to c4 for the e7 B...} 23. Bc3 {Better was 23. Bb3, challenging the c4 square, or even 23. Kh1, saving the R from the coming pin.} Bc5 {The white R at f2 is now lost, as it has no defender...} 24. Rd1 {Better here may have been 24. Rf1 or 24. Be1. The only piece to recapture the black B after BxR is now the Q, which will pull her away from bolstering the square g4...} Bxf2+ 25. Qxf2 f3 {Preparing for 26...Bg2, after which the white K is immobilized.} 26. Nxf3 {?? A fatal error. White has now abandoned the square of g4 and allowed a full assault by Black's Q.} Qg4+ {!! White now has no escape. 27. Qg2 results in immediate mate after 27... QxQ#, and any move by the King results in 27. Rxf3 and the rapid suffocation of White's King.} 27. Kh2 Rxf3 {As expected. White cannot now recover. 28. QxF3 Qxf3 leaves him with a R and B vs. a Q, R and B for Black as well as a King nearly cornered. 28. Rg1 Qf4 ,  29. Kh1 Rxf2 with mate soon to follow. White underestimated the importance of maintaing the defense of g4 in a situation where his protective pawns had been sent too far ahead to be of value to the castled King.} 28. Qxf3 {With QxQ and a losing game to follow, White resigns}
