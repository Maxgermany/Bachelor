1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {The Petroff, one of the more counterattacking responses to e4 and Nf3.} 3. Nxe5 Nc6 {This variation is weak if white plays correctly, but contains various traps.} 4. Nxc6 dxc6 5. Nc3 Bc5 6. Be2 {Here white has a seemingly solid position, but I had a winning bishop sacrifice - or so I thought...} Bxf2+ {If white had played 6.Bc4?, then this would be winning after 7...Qd4+; here it epicly fails. Unfortunately, I had mixed up my opening lines!} 7. Kxf2 Qd4+ 8. Ke1 h5 {I decided that I had better make the most of a bad job, and go for all out attack.} 9. d3 h4 10. Rf1 h3 11. g3 {There goes attempt no.#1.} g6 12. Bf3 Nh5 {Planning ...Nxg3!, with a completely revitalised position.} 13. Bxh5 {Damn.} gxh5 14. Qf3 {Threatening f7. Since I wanted to open lines, there was really only one possible response.} f5 15. exf5 Bd7 {...Kf7 was far stronger. Instead this allows a forced queen exchange.} 16. Qe3+ Qxe3+ 17. Bxe3 Kf7 {Blocking the pawn.} 18. Kd2 Rae8 {If the a7 pawn is taken, then ...b6 traps the bishop.} 19. Rae1 Rhg8 20. Bd4 b6 21. Be5 c5 {Since I had lost another pawn, I decided to give my bishop a good square while at it.} 22. Bxc7 Bc6 23. Ne4 {Threatening Nd6+. Perhaps exchanging was the wrong response, but by this point I don't think it makes a massive difference.} Bxe4 24. Rxe4 Rec8 25. Bd6 Rc6 26. Be5 Rg5 27. f6 {This advances the pawn, but creates vulnerabilities that allow me to delay the end.} b5 {Planning ...c4.} 28. b3 c4 29. dxc4 bxc4 30. Bb2 c3+ {This opens up the c file.} 31. Bxc3 Rgc5 32. Re7+ Kf8 33. Re3 {The best resonse, avoiding retreat and loss of material.} Kf7 {Attempting to bring the position back to where it was and delay white's progress.} 34. Rfe1 {Threatening to place rooks on e7 and e8, at which point the pawn is unstoppable.} Rc6c8 {Covering the 8th rank - the seventh is lost already.} 35. Re3e7+ Kf8 36. Re1e3 {Protecting the bishop.} Rd8+ 37. Kc1 Rdc8 38. Kb2 Rf5 {Now, black can try ...Rxc3 which creates further delay.} 39. Rxa7 Rf2 {Trying to promote the h-pawn in retaliation. Unfortunately, this is too slow.} 40. Ree7 Rxh2 41. Reh7 {And quick mate is inevitable. Congratulations to my opponent, who played a good consolidation and expansion game and deserved the full point, and a rather embarrassing loss for me, which I was unfortunately denied the chance to gain revenge for by our schools' teams being placed in different groups for the rest of the tournament.}
