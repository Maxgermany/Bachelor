1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {Sicilian Moscow} Nc6 4. O-O a6 5. Bxc6+ bxc6 6. c4 e5 7. d3 Nf6 8. Re1 Be7 9. Nbd2 O-O 10. Nf1 Rb8 {I assume the point of this was to immobilize the bishop for some time.} 11. Ne3 d5 {This move loses a pawn, but left me an isolated d-pawn and got black's pieces active.} 12. exd5 cxd5 13. Nxe5 Qd6 14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. cxd5 Qxd5 16. Nc4 {To threaten the e7 bishop.} Bb7 {To do Qxg2#} 17. Ne3 Qc6 18. Qg4 {To do Nf5. Note the queen is also defending g2.} g6 19. Nf5 Qxg2+ {This looks like a good move, but I have an intermediate move.} 20. Qxg2 Bxg2 21. Nxe7+ Kh8 22. Kxg2 Rfe8 23. Bd2 {To threaten a mate in 2 and connect my rooks to free the knight from it's pin. Perhaps Bf4 was better or seemed better, attacking the b8 rook, but I just wanted to get the game over with. I probably would have played Bf4 in a real tournament. } Rxb2 {My opponent thought he got a pawn here.} 24. Bc3+ f6 {Here, I have two options. Take the rook or the f6 pawn. If you are under 1000 rated, think about my next move.} 25. Bxf6# {Checkmate. The lesson here is to find intermediate moves, Always think before taking "free" material, and try to block the opponent's threats, and pose your own.}
