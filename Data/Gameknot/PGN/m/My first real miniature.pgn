1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 {Indian defense. Very standard.} 3. Bg5 d5 4. c5 {Takes space and blocks my DSB.} h6 5. Bxf6 Qxf6 {This seems fairly standard. No questions yet.} 6. e3 {Protects the pawn and opens up for LSB. White is perfectly fine.} Nc6 {developing normaly.} 7. Bb5 {Also normal. Pins my knight.} Bd7 {Unpins the knight and sets up a bishop retake if he decides to exchange.} 8. Qb3 {This also seems fine. It does bring out the queen a bit early. That usually can be a problem.} e5 {Aiming at his pawn chain this hangs the d5 pawn but I reasoned that O-O-O would place rather large presure on his queen and should give me a possibility to  pull ahead in development.} 9. Qxd5 {He grabs the pawn. I think this is his first misstake. But it doesnt seem like a very large one.} O-O-O {Following the plan.} 10. dxe5 {? My own analysis suggests that this was a bad move. After Nxe5 it looks rather bleak for white. For example Nxe5 11. Bxd7 Rxd7 12. Qe4 Nd3! The tactical possibilities for black are limitless.} Nxe5 11. Ba6 {?? Is there a way for white to fight on here? The apparent mate threat is irrelevant. At the time I just saw this as a continuation on the theme "chasing the queen for development"} Bc6 {Double attacking the queen. Move it or loose it. Only b3 is open.} 12. Qb3 bxa6 {White is lost in more ways than I can count. I really cant see any way for white to get out of trouble. The best I can do is Nd2. Something like 13. Nd2 Nd3ch 14. Kc2 Qf5ch 15. e4 Bxe4ch Mayhem.} 13. Ne2 {Doesn't block thed file. Not good.} Nd3+ {Also his knight occupies the escape square The king now has to go to the d file and Nxc5ch will win his queen, and white still have major problems even holding on to the rest of his material.} 14. Kf1 {This felt like a resign.} Qxf2# {Again my question here is, at what point did this become inevitable?}
