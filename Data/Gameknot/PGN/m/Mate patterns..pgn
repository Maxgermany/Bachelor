1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 {The funny Budapest.} 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bf4 Bb4+ {Not still clear if advisable or not. Some theory recommends Qe7 and developement through g6, Bg7.} 6. Nbd2 {The best response... for me. White's queen is controlled on the d column. } Qe7 {I have to look for Nf4x e4, otherwise it will be kicked to h6. } 7. Bg5 {Nice, and getting right away into the tactic. I accepted the challenge. } f6 8. exf6 gxf6 9. Bf4 d6 {I know I will end up losing the dsb by the knight, but in the meanwhile I can catch up in developement. } 10. h3 Nge5 11. Bxe5 {Bh6 was interesting for black. I'll have answered NxN, and white must have accepted g2xN.} dxe5 12. a3 Bxd2+ 13. Qxd2 Be6 {A strange asset for black, but it can hold. Maybe. } 14. e3 Rd8 15. Qc2 Bf7 {?? A blunder. f5 was called for, assuring space in the center and blocking the white squares. } 16. Bd3 Rxd3 {I had to play for what I already did, so I went for a sac. A "positional" sac, very doubious. } 17. Qxd3 Bg6 18. e4 Kf7 19. Qd5+ Kg7 20. Nh4 Rd8 21. Nxg6 {My bishop was useless anyway. } hxg6 22. Qb5 Nd4 {White should now castle kingside. } 23. Qa4 Qc5 {If b4, Qxc4. } 24. O-O Ne2+ 25. Kh2 Nf4 {!? Looking for something, but I was in doubt with Rd2, that now looks preferable. } 26. Qc2 Rd4 {Attacking. Something back from the sac. } 27. Rad1 Rxc4 {...at a great cost, of course. } 28. Rd7+ Kh6 {I have to go there or the game will be at a dead end. } 29. Qd2 {Pinning the knight! Ok, ok! You'll see...} Rxe4 {Probably Rc2 would have been more accurate. } 30. g3 Re2 {...but this is a nice shot I planned. The white queen cannot keep defending f2, and Rxf2+ is lethal. } 31. Rd5 Qb6 32. Qc1 Rxf2+ 33. Kg1 {Nxh3 is impossible, but...} Rc2+ {...ruinous loss of material is in sight. White resigns. A devilish po(i)sition...}
