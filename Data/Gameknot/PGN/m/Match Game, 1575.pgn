[Black "Giovanni Leonardo di Bona da Cutri "]
[Opening "King's gambit (C30)"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 d6 {The opening is instead a King's Gambit Declined. } 3. Bc4 {Chess tactics were primitive in 1575, but attacking KB7 has been part of the game since it was given its modern form.} c6 {I guess da Cutri wanted another open diagonal for his Queen. I can think of no other explanation for this move. } 4. Nf3 {Ruy Lopez is planning a sacrificial attack on KB7. } Bg4 {Da Cutri tries to defend with a pin, immobilizing the Knight.} 5. fxe5 {Ruy Lopez has seen one move farther.} dxe5 {Da Cutri completes the exchange...} 6. Bxf7+ {Now this move wins two Pawns.} Kxf7 {There are no good alternatives.} 7. Nxe5+ {This fork wins the exposed Bishop.} Ke8 {As good or bad as anything else.} 8. Qxg4 {Not only does Ruy Lopez win back the piece, he also augments his attack on da Cutri's undeveloped position by mobilizing the Queen.} Nf6 {He has to do somethig to slow the onslaught.} 9. Qe6+ {Turning up the heat.} Qe7 {Trying to break the attack, although even if Ruy Lopez exchanges Queens his two Pawns up give him a technically easy win [by modern standards].} 10. Qc8+ {Forcing da Cutri's response.} Qd8 {He has no choice, but now disaster strikes.} 11. Qxd8+ {Setting up a deadly fork.} Kxd8 {Forced again, but...} 12. Nf7+ {The Rook falls. Da Cutri resigned the game. Ruy Lopez went on to win the match and become the unofficial "champion".}
