1. e4 {This game begins with WT attaining the larger center and a space advantage from the opening, plus an open e-file. Although BL does not neglect development nor lag significantly in it, Kingside attack with be initiated after he permits some weakening in that sector. From that point WT will strive to open lines there and to bring all his pieces into the hunt as well. Then despite good resistance presented, comes to use the weakened white squares there; to occupy a hole upon g6; and finally bring home a point by sacrificing upon h6.   * * * * *  I've always felt 1.e4 the hardest move to meet as Black, as do many, including GM RJ Fischer. } d6 2. d4 e6 3. Bd3 Be7 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. O-O O-O {Assessing the position, it is somewhat deceptive in nature. It is easy to see WT enjoys a space advantage, with his "ideal center" of e4 and d4 ... compared to the so-called 'small' or 'minor' center of BL on d6 & e6. But what is especially deceptive here is WT's lead in development. (What?! Why both sides have o-o & developed 2 minor pieces, yes?) WT's pieces could conceivably come to use where they stand, whereas blacks will be somewhat self-blocking. But this is a part of the natural WT advantage in many postions. The benefits of the first move. They dont come to natural use in this game and must be repositioned to increase scope later. } 6. c4 {Having the "ideal" or "Big" Center, WT will not jeopardize it by pressing ahead foolishly, without a clear gain and goal from it. Nor by Locking the center so early and minimizing his central advantage almost upon conception. Instead, WT adds to the breadth, security & influence of his center. Perhaps later it will become some form of wedge into BL's space further, but BL will have to Earn any concessions he gets there, and such wedges have some advantages of their own, attendant.  } h6 {When I see such a pawn move in front of a King, my first thought is Always "TARGET". } 7. Qe2 {A useful waiting move that prepares d1 for a Rook and supports a potential e5 push. Based upon his next move or two, I'll decide whether I wish to play Nc3 & keep my B aimed at h6, or instead play Nbd2 and b3 with the Bb2. In the former setup there would still be an option of striking at h6/g6/h7 ... or playing on the Q-side with b4 and the Be3 or Bf4.  I felt a wait appropriate here since I do not have a enough development, nor lead in it, to initiate a successful attack now; but do have a significant space advantage that will not go away. Often such factors favor taking time to buildup, with emphasis upon proper piece placement rather than rapidity. That is what I plan to do, unless he 'gives me something'.  } Nbd7 {Remember what was said about Development? If ...Nc6 it would have blocked in his c-pawn which he will need free if he is to play upon the Q-side. And the N might be subject to harrassment there.  Now Nbd7 is nice, in that it will support a c5 push. There upon he would finally get some center only to realize BL is on the hard side of a Maroczy Bind. It also blocks in the Bc8. He might have considered Na6 instead, which also supports ...c5, and could then move to Nc7 and there support a ...b5 push if WT were to answer ...c5 with d5. Ending up in a very Modern-Benoni-like formation for BL.  I'm just not sure if he would have time to preceed his Na6 by ....a5 tho, as in the Petrosian KI system. } 8. Rd1 {I took a Long-Hard Look at 8.e5 followed by Qe4, but felt it a bit premature. He can meet it by Ne8 followed by ...f5. With or without exchanging pawns on e5, at this time. Thus 8.Rd1 to prepare the e5 push. But he removes the Nf6 as an object of attack first.} Ne8 9. e5 c6 10. Nc3 d5 11. b3 a6 12. c5 {Before he played ...a6?! my c5 move could be met by ...b6 (then if b4 ...a5!) and after cxb6 ...axb6 he has fluid Q-side pawns lusting to expand, and obviously WT's attempt to bind comes to worse than nothing since it actually encourages BL's play there. But now after ...a6 it is a different matter. } f6 13. exf6 Ndxf6 {If he tried 13...Nexf6 14.Qxe6  Kh8 then 15.Nh4 is too powerful. But allowing my Ne5 as in the game is also very dangerous. BL might try to gambit off the e6 pawn with Bxf6 or defending it by Rxf6. But in either case WT could still get to play Ne5 if he leaves the e6 pawn alone, tho vs Bxf6 that does yield BL counterplay. So there I would have probably gone ahead and played Qxe6  ...Kh8, Qf5 forcing ...g6, Qxg6 ...Qe7, intending Bxh6 & Re1.   If 13...Bxf6 14Qe6  Rf7? 15.Bg6 and then something like 15...Nde5 attempting a Q-trap fails to 16.Bxf7  Kh8 17.Qxe8} 14. Ne5 Nc7 15. Bc2 Bd7 16. Rd3 Be8 17. Rg3 Kh8 {Besides Qd3, I also looked at immediatly plugging the g6 hole with a minor piece, ala Nimzovich, or Rg6.  And looked at lines recapturing a minor there with the Rook as well. To then gang-up on the Nf6. The ideas present include Bxh6 then, and/or Bg5, all of which are discussed more in my note to BL's move 19...Kg8} 18. Qd3 Bf7 {18...Bf7 is a good try since it frees e8 for his N to go there and help support the Nf6. In that regard, Bh5 also deserved a look. But note that the Bf7 can never safely retreat Bg8 due to the terrible "windmill" Ng6  would produce. Additionally, it prevents the lift of ...Rf5 later to block WT's Bishop from the h7 square, which was a saving resource vs an 18.Bxh6 sac. Now 19.Bxh6 would work insofar as being an untakable Bishop. Still that is not WT's best here.} 19. Ng6+ {If 19...Bxg6 then Qxg6 wins most quickly. So he correctly tries to distract WT from the attack, offering to give up the Exchange. The trouble with 19.Bxh6 was only that BL might have replied with ...g6 to try hindering the attack. So Ng6  is the more accurate. (If WT HAD played 19Bxh6 then BL could not take it as 20.Qe3 mates shortly.)} Kg8 { Although 20.Qxg6 wins quickly vs 19...Bxg6, I also thought 20.Rxg6 quite strong. [a good analytical exercise here ... ] If the Q recapture were not available, it would pay to look at the Rook alternative and review the attacking ideas therein, which focus most importantly upon the idea of eliminating the Nf6 , removing defense of the h7 mating square.  In such lines, WT should realize that important concepts to analyze involve seeing the move Bg5, both with or without Bxh6 preceding it, as well as just Bxh6.  By Bg5 WT could eliminate the Nf6 defender, even if backed-up by Nce8.  And once the B is moved from c1 it would allow the final WT attacker, the Ra1, to enter the fray if needed. Thus in such position the attacker might even consider moves such as Bg5/Bh6 simply as a clearance sac, even if it had no other purpose, so as to involve that Rook in the matter.  To students of tactics, "Take three points", as they say :) if you looked at the 2 B moves and saw all three reasons for considering them. 1)Clearance (2)re-attack of Nf6 by Bg5,  & (3)line opening by Bh6 ... important general concepts of attack.  }8-)} 20. Bxh6 {The following is more explanation of a general concept, than being particularly applicable to this game. But something that I feel worth knowing ... Last move I mentioned part of the reason to look at a move like Bxh6 being line opening. This may cause one to ask "What? I thought that refers to opening My Own lines to attack upon." Answer:Yes, it usually does. However, consider it a more advanced concept then, that it can also include opening Opponent's Lines! ... in the field of attack. Why might you Want to do that>? Well, largely because in such position as it is advantageous, you Gain scope upon the opponents line opened, if you can take control of it.  For instance here, (disregard any other tactics or consequences, this is just to make a case in point example, not explain this position, especially) if gxh6 were played, note how that if WT could capture that pawn, or if the B is not taken, and if in either case WT could gain control of that H-File ... he is no longer striking there at only h6 where the pawn was. With a R or Q there now, he would also be striking clear thru the File to h7 and h8 as well.! In fact if that Ng6 were then to stay there, a Q could mate by Qh8, or if the Nf6 were to move, then a Q on the h-file could mate by Qh7. Thus by opening an Opponents Line, WT would have made the BL position possess greater exposure and more lines of entry into it as well. Do you see my point then?  [One opening where this is more commonly illustrated would be in the h-file attack of the Yugoslav, Dragon Sicilian. There are situations where BL will avoid responding to h5xg6 there by h7xg6 for just the reason I've illustrated above, and instead go f7xg6. Especially if he has played his B back to Bh8, since then it might be subject to capture or sac capture there, rather than helping guard h8 as if it were still a Bg7 there. ]} Bxg6 {And he resigns, as 21.Qxg6 is quickly fatal, since 22. Xxg7 will follow.}
