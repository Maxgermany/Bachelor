1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {A change from my usual response.} 3. e5 {One which Chuck intends to punish.} Nd5 4. Nc3 e6 5. Nxd5 exd5 6. d4 Nc6 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. Qxd5 Qb6 9. Bc4 Bxf2+ 10. Ke2 O-O 11. Rf1 Bc5 12. Ng5 {I've been told that this is book opening (or at least a book position).  In any event White certainly has a lot of firepower targeted on my f7 square.} Ne7 {This was my way of putting the question to White.  I wanted him to withdraw his Queen though after Qf3 I am not so sure that I gained all that much.  Charles, was never one to retreat however.  He charges full speed ahead into the attack.} 13. Qxf7+ Rxf7 14. Bxf7+ Kh8 15. Bc4 Ng6 16. Nf7+ Kg8 17. Nd6+ {White can now draw by repetition.  The better move to play for a win was probably Ng5 check.} Kh8 18. Bd3 Bxd6 {I felt an additional guard for f8 wouldn't hurt.} 19. Bxg6 hxg6 {Taking the d5 pawn would have allowed a back rank mate.  By capturing at g6 I gave my King a flight square.} 20. exd6 Qxd6 21. Be3 b6 {Threatening Ba6 check.} 22. c4 Ba6 {Bb7 was probably better.} 23. b3 Re8 24. g3 Qe5 25. Rae1 Qxe3+ 26. Kd1 Qd3+ 27. Kc1 Rxe1+ 28. Rxe1 Qc3+ 29. Kd1 Qa1+ 30. Kd2 Qxa2+ 31. Kc3 Qxh2 32. Re8+ Kh7 {White resigned; at least he got in one final check!!}
