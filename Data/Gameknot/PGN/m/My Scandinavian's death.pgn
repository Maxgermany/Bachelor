1. e4 {This game is The Proof, once for all, that "My Scandinavian", doesn't work against d5. I, regretfully, have to admit that.  "My Scandinavian" is a way to proceed into the Scandiavian that gave me very nice moments, surprisingly tactic games, won by black with sacs on the queenside.  I suspected that it won't hold against d5, but the truth is that ALMOST NOBODY goes for an early d5, not even (standard) chess engines (I don't use them, but I remember I tried sometimes in the last years).  Now, I tested the opening with a strong player, and I fell miserably.   Incidentally, the game could have been the scenario for an interesting tactic strike by black, and I wonder if I (black) could have sustained my "crazy" sac. } d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {This seems a "naive" move. It is not. The queen is going to c7, taking advantage of the check tempo. White can avoid that, of course, but has to half-scramble his game in order to do that, and there is no need for it since white is in no danger. } 3. Nc3 {Normal, taking advantage of dev+tempo.} Qe5+ {Returning the pleasure.} 4. Be2 {The most common answer. Qe2 is seldom seen, and I personally go QxQ. It is not clear (form me, but I don't read books :-( ) if after this black can catch up in developement and reach equality. I have a nice win in my early annotated games. Ne2 is not bad, since it helps in supporting f5 (that will become very important later) and the lsb can try to fianchetto. Nobody does that, but I think I would go for it as white. } c6 {Necessary to avoid knight's jumps.} 5. Nf3 {Normal.} Qc7 {Now, it seems that black is heavily undeveloped, and he IS. True is that his developement has been tested in hundred of games, and I have a very good score with it. I have no weak points, and all my pieces has places to go. } 6. d4 Bf5 {This is the first moment I go "my way", really. I just don't like the bishop to be trapped in after e6. I know that this bishop can be exchanged with the knight in 3, eventually, but it's ok, provided I use this to open the h column to my rook. This compensates black's position enough to equalize. In most cases. But I think that 7. d5 is just crusching for black. But nobody goes for it. } 7. O-O {Normal. Now, until now, I assumed that with e6 I am out of danger. That's not true, as this game will demostrate. } e6 8. d5 {Now, the point is that if exd5, after Re1 white has so many threats over black's position that I just consider that it is not a desirable game for black. Nxd5, cxd5, Bb5++ and only a miracle can save black. Similar destiny happened after cxd5. Now, I had to opt among several moves, considering both white pawns' take on the next move...} Nd7 {I didn't intend anyway to answer dxc6 with Nxc6. By experience, I know that this knight will be soon under heavy attack, and that it is much better to have a pawn in c6 (at "any cost") than a knight. This also opens a quick way for a surprise queenside castling, bringing the rook junt in front of white's queen. This can be a good resource, in this line. I hold white's attacks on the queenside. } 9. Nd4 {A hoax. I can't allow white to exchange my bishop and open the e column. But after I retire it to g6 (no N moves were good to cover it), dxe6 leaves black in a very weak position, and I didn't want to play in such a disastrous position. So, once I assumed that "My Scandinavian" is just crap, I tried to have fun and get tactic. } g6 {A sac in order to open the g column and hope in some counterplay. It doesn't come on time. } 10. g4 e5 {I take advantage of the fact that the knight must retire far from the action, on b3. Better than nothing. } 11. Nb3 Ngf6 {To have g8 for the rook. I know it doesn't seem promising, but... } 12. gxf5 Bd6 {Of course, if fxg6, hxg6 makes me very strong all of a sudden after e5.} 13. dxc6 bxc6 {My only hope is the battery on h2 (a known plan in My Scandinavian, but that doesn't hold with an open queenside. } 14. Bf3 {I waited for Bb5, since cxB, Nxb5 etc. destroys black's game. I Know that Nb5 will come, but I planned to let the bishop get the rook, be trapped, while my strong diagonal will open. } gxf5 15. Nb5 cxb5 16. Bxa8 e4 {I have some hope, now. I can focus it now, not during the game (it was an overwork time for me). If black could move now, Ng4 is very strong. After it, Bxh2+ becomes a mate threat, since Kh1, Bg1!! and black threats two mates at once, no matter which minor piece is taken. Very nice, indeed. White can defend with f5, then e6xf4ep, and the threat is renewed. This time, white can save, just maybe, but he won't like the game at all.  Now, I realize it NOW. During the game, I was looking for Nf3 (in order to avoid f5, that ruins all my plan), and a lot of tactic lines came to my mind. It was fun, but confusing.   The rest of the game is not whorth a look... :-(} 17. Nd4 {I could have still tried Ng4. If Nxb5, Bxh2+, Kh1, Nxf2+, RxN, Qg3, maybe - just maybe - something can be there.   Still unprocessed, these are some lines I explored during the game.    17... Bxh2+ 18.	Kh1   	Ne5 (the bishop is untouchable, of course:)  19.	Kxh2 	Nf3+  20.	Kh1	        Qh2#  Probably black could have tried  17...                  a7-a6, but it comes 18.	Bc6   	Bxh2+ 19.	Kh1   	Ng4 is still a threat, but it comes 20.	Bxd7+	Kf8 (the king can't take it because of the discovered check in b5. Black is threatening Bg1, so he doesn't care to lose a piece) 21.	Bh6+ 	Kg8 (if NxB, the mate threat can be controlled by white with Qh5) 22.	f4      	exf3(ep) 23.	Qxf3	        and I am not sure if black can keep the momentum. } Ne5 18. Nxb5 Qb8 19. Nxd6+ {}
