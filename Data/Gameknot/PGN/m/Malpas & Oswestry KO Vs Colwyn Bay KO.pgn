1. d4 {Played in the Chester Chess League handicapped knock-out. http://www.cdchessleague.org.uk/results.php?comp=Knock+Out} Nf6 {Starts conventionally. Steve's own comments are once again given in inverted commas.} 2. Nf3 {Slightly less popular than 2. c4 but perfectly playable.} d5 {Black restores symmetry.} 3. Bf4 {White decides on the popular London system which is vogue at the moment. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System Incidentally I disagree with the comment on that Wiki page "If White is going to play the London System, it is now thought to be more accurate to play 2.Bf4 instead of 2.Nf3 and 3.Bf4" because 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 can be met with ....d6 and a later ....e5.} e6 {This blocks in the Bc8 and scores much worse than 3.....c5!} 4. e3 {The logical developing move.} Nbd7 {Again black avoids the natural 4.....c5! and instead plays a move passive move. As Steve correctly says "c5 if the latest theory and counterattacking".} 5. c3 {This is often played in the London system, although I prefer the more common 5. Bd3 keeping open the possibility of playing c2-c4 in one move.} Be7 {"Bd6 much better in my opinion to neutralise my strong Bishop". Actually Be7 is more popular and scores better on the opening databases I use, but 4......Bd6 was probably better than 4.....Nbd7.} 6. Nbd2 {Sensible development by Steve.} b6 {"again preparing move for c5...a bit slow". Yes, surely 6......0-0 is the natural move.} 7. Bb5 {"used to put his pieces on the squares I want i.e. to force him to castle into my attack!" Certainly Steve shows originality. 7. Ne5 and 7. Bd3 are the moves usually played here. this move takes me out of the opening databases I use.} O-O {Fritz prefers 7....Nh5} 8. h4 {Fritz prefers 0-0. This attack by white is a little optimistic.} Bb7 {"rather than this he needs to get pieces over to help his King". Fritz is still suggesting 8.....Nh5} 9. Bd3 {"re-pointing at the King forcing the line that happens, weakening his King-side". Fritz still likes 0-0 but certainly 9. Bd3 looks a more logical follow-up to 8. h4} Ne4 {"only move to try to hold on". Fritz agrees that this is the best move.} 10. Qc2 {"Once again pointing at the king-side". Fritz agrees that this is the best move.} f5 {"weakening but necessary". Fritz likes this move too.} 11. Bxe4 {Fritz actually prefers h5 here.} fxe4 {The natural way to recapture.} 12. Ng5 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} Bxg5 {"maybe this is forced not sure about what else after all leaving the Knight there just helps the attack." Fritz does not agree and gives 12. .....Rf6 13. 0-0-0 h6 14. Nh3 with a slight edge to black.} 13. hxg5 {"the key move making the 'London rook' a monster". Fritz agrees that this is the best move and now gives a slight edge to white.} Ba6 {"trying to gain the light squares in case of holding on...a good attempt to gain some counter chances later". Fritz suggests the pseudo-sacrifice 13.....e5! with only the very minimal advantage to white.} 14. Qb3 {"not sure if this was all that good but semi-threat of a knight sacrifce opening up the a2 to g8 diagonal". Fritz prefers 14. Qa4} c5 {"at last but maybe a bit late". Fritz agrees this is best.} 15. Qd1 {"again a regrouping with threats to go to h5 and g4". It seems to me that white has just wasted a move with 14. Qb3 followed by 15. Qd1. Why not 14. Qd1 at once?} Rf5 {Fritz prefers 15.... cxd4 with slight edge to black.} 16. Qg4 {Fritz is still suggesting 16. Qa4 but surely this is more consistent.} Qe7 {"not protecting the King.....Nf8!? maybe needed here....not sure as hard for Black to defend all the threats". Fritz likes 16. Qe8 here.} 17. Rxh7 {"forces mate after g6+ if taken....if not as you will see a loss of Knight and pawn to save mate". Fritz prefers Qh4. I think both Steve and Tim miscalculated here. If 17.....Kxh7 18. g6+ Kg8 19. Qh3 Nf6 20. 0-0-0 Kg8 and the Nf6 can drop back to g8 if necessary. White has inadequate compensation for the rook.} Nf6 {Thankfully Tim didn't take!} 18. gxf6 {Threatening the queen.} Qxf6 {Getting a pawn for the knight.} 19. Rh3 {"despite Black's attempts to get counter-play once all this has been snuffed out it should be a win for White". Quite true Steve.} cxd4 {Finally, 5 moves late.} 20. cxd4 {White recaptures.} Rf8 {Better Rc8 to stop castling and taking control of the open file.} 21. Rc1 {So Steve correctly takes it instead.} e5 {Fritz again wants 21.....Rc8} 22. dxe5 {The correct way to take.} Rxe5 {Black takes back. I suspect both players thought that white couldn't take the rook here because of 23....Qxf2+. Although it looks scary, the line is winning for white. Sure black can win white's rook with 24. Kd1 Qg1+ 25. Kc2 Rc8+ 26. Kb3 and the rook on c8 can be captured by rook or queen - but both of them fail as white has Qxg7 mate.} 23. Qh4 {"if g5 trying to win a piece....Qh7 mate!!....23....QxQh4! perhaps the only try...." Quite right Steve, Fritz does agree the queen exchange is black's best try.} Qxh4 {So black takes.} 24. Rxh4 {White takes back.} Ref5 {The best square for the rook, although with queens off it is a bit academic. White is a clear pawn up.} 25. Bg3 {Fritz (and I!) prefer 25. Nb3 heading for d4. 25....g5 can be met with 26. Rg4.} d4 {"care needed by White as there are still some tricks".} 26. Rxe4 {Another pawn goes.} dxe3 {Black takes.} 27. Rxe3 {White takes back.} Rh5 {"a good attempt for Rh1+ etc."} 28. Ne4 {"Must get the minor pieces working to hold off the threats". The point being that after 28.....Rh1+ 29. Kd2 Rd8+ white can block on d6 with either minor piece.} Rff5 {The threat now is Rh1+ 30. Kd2	Rd5+ 31. Kc2 Bd3+ winning a rook. Thankfully white has a move first.} 29. Rcc3 {"now I felt the worst has passed"} Rh1+ {Black throws in a check.} 30. Kd2 {Forced.} Rd5+ {Another check} 31. Kc2 {White's king is safe now.} Bb7 32. Nd6 {"sets up the winning endgame....too many threats and defensive resources" Fritz prefers 32. Rc7} Ba6 {Best, but now it is black who has wasted time!} 33. Rc7 {White correctly grabs the 7th rank. } Rhd1 {"best try". Fritz prefers Ra1.} 34. Be5 {"forces a trade or so I felt". I agree, I would have played this. Fritz prefers 34. Rxa7 but it is getting academic white is a clear knight and pawn up and black would probably resign, if it wasn't for the fact that it is was a very close match.} Rxe5 {Fritz agrees this is best.} 35. Rxe5 {Whiute takes.} Rxd6 {Black takes back.} 36. Rxa7 {"the exchanges have helped White to secure his King and stop all the tricks...now it is pure technique...time control reached...."} Bf1 {Attacking g2} 37. g4 {Easily met.} Rc6+ {Another check} 38. Kd2 {King moves.} Rd6+ {Another check.} 39. Ke3 {King improves his position.} Rd3+ {Another check.} 40. Kf4 {"supporting the f and g pawns".} Bg2 41. Kg5 {His Imperial Highness advances to help weave a mating net! Fritz actually prefers Re-e7 but both win, so let's not quibble. } Kh7 {Black's king fears being trapped on the back rank.} 42. f4 {Fritz still like Re-e7 but this is strong too.} Rd6 {Rook retreats.} 43. f5 {"finally Black has nothing left to do but resign".
