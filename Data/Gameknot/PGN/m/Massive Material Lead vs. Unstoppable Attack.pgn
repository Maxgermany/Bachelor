1. d4 {Playing Black is my friend Baker, who always seems to get positions where he is down lots of material and still wins.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 {So far these are the opening moves of the standard King's Indian Defense. In Indian Defenses such as Nimzo and Queen's, Black does not challenge White in the center with pawns, and instead goes for rapid development and only challenges the center once he is completely developed. } d6 {This important move stops e5, and the central break after castling will either be an e5 boost or c5 boost, depending on what kind of position you want.} 5. Be2 O-O 6. Nf3 {This is where Black decides which way to challenge the center. The c5-boost is usually better in lines where White makes kingside progress such as in the 4-pawns attack or Saemisch. In this line, which is mainline King's Indian, Black usually plays e5, but c5 is just as fine, which can transpose to a Maroczy Bind or Benoni structure.} e5 {The line dxe5 dxe5 Nxe5 Nxe4 usually favors Black, since opening the position usually favors whoever is castled and less weakened.} 7. O-O {This is the most common move. Against 7.d5, Black wouldn't be able to develop the knight to c6, but can then take advantage of the c5 weakness with Nfd7 Na6, which contains White's queenside, while Black still has lots of flexibility on the kingside.} Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. Nd2 {This move differs from the main line. Usually White wants to gain space on the queenside quickly with pawn pushes, and delays the maneuvering of pieces for a few moves. Against moves like 9.Nd2 and 9.Ne1, Black cannot play the agressive Nh5 which is a typical move in mainline king's indian. In this line, Black should move the knight somewhere else to prepare for the f5-boost.} a5 {Baker wanted to take advantage of the fact that White didn't play b4, but then decided that a5 wasn't necessary and that he should've been making plans on the kingside. I disagree, and I think a5 is good because White had to make 2 preparing moves in order to play b4.} 10. a3 Nd7 {Knights tend to have the most flexibility on e7 and d7 (or e2 and d2), but moving them there early is passive and can usually be taken advantage of. Wasting 2 knight moves (Nf6 Nc6 Ne7 Nd7) to get the knights to these flexible squares is not really a waste of tempo, and are actually common maneuvers in openings like Ruy Lopez or other closed positions} 11. Rb1 Kh8 {At first glance this move seems awkward and Black could do better by playing f5 now and starting a kingside attack. The main reason for this move is to play Rg8 during the attack, so it's better to play Kh8 before the attack, because Black won't want to make a move like Kh8 during the middle of his attack. But I don't think Kh8 is that necessary this early in the game.} 12. b4 f5 {Now it's time for Black to start the pawnstorm, with f5 followed by f4 and g5.} 13. f3 {bxa5 isn't good because it trades a pawn for a less valuable pawn, and also isolates the a-pawn. White solidifies his structure, but has also blocked the bishop's diagonal from interfering with Black's kingside play.} f4 14. Nb3 {White has pressure on the a-pawn, so Black traded pawns. I thought b6 was better.} axb4 15. axb4 g5 {The play of the position is clear. Both sides will attempt to break the pawn chain from the base of the enemy's pawn chain by maneuvering minor pieces to help with pawn advances and attacking. It's only a question of who can generate the most activity and break the chain more effectively.} 16. Bb2 {c5 looks sharper, but this bishop has to develop sometime. Baker and I analysed the interesting idea of Bd2-Be1-Bf2, which isn't really bad for White, just an awkward maneuver. But I think the bishop would be better on f2, even though it takes 2 extra moves.} Nf6 {Even though Baker moved his knight back and forth, it was needed to boost the f-pawn, and now the knight needs to come back to help with the h5-g4 boost} 17. c5 h5 18. Nd2 {White's knight has also moved back and forth. The knight isn't much good on b3, so White remaneuvers it to c4 to pressure the d-pawn.} Ng6 {It's important that Black doesn't play g4 too early, and sets the pieces in attacking positions beforehand, plus it leaves Black more flexibilty if he doesn't want to play g4 and instead h4-h3} 19. Nc4 g4 {This is probably stronger than the h4-h3 idea, since it'll be hard for Black to make the g4-boost without support, and also the Kh8 move is only useful if the g-file will become opened.} 20. cxd6 cxd6 21. Nb5 {White puts pressure on the weak d6-pawn, and Black's only ways of defending are Ra6 and Ne8. Ne8 has the interesting idea of saccing the g-pawn to open up lines to White's king, but Ne8 also wastes so much tempo with that knight, so Ra6 is better. } Ra6 {If White takes the pawn, then Black wins two pieces for a rook and pawn. 2 pieces for a rook is often a crushing advantage in the opening, the minor pieces have superior mobility in positions with lots of pieces on the board, and the fact that there are 2 attacking forces vs. 1 is also important. The advantage of 2 pieces for a rook isn't as strong in the endgame where the rook has lots of open space, and where the rook's extra pawn is stronger. This position is clearly not an endgame and not an open position.} 22. Rc1 {White wants to invade the queenside via c7. Playing Nc7 will harass the oddly placed rook. So far Black has excellent minor piece activity and pawn play on the kingside, and it's just a matter of time before Baker activates his queen. Black's only problem piece is the rook that needs to defend the base of the pawn chain. Once the base of the chain falls, usually the pawns behind it fall too.} Bd7 {Black wants to kick off the annoying knight, to relieve the pressure on d6. White still cannot take d6 because Rxd6 Nxd6 Qb6  wins two minor pieces for a rook.} 23. Nc7 {Obviously Qxc7 loses to Nxe5. This is where the game kicks into high gear and the players should take their time. It seems that White's queenside attack is quicker than Black's kingside pawnstorm, so Black must take drastic action. Black's rook is seriously out of play and has no influence on the kingside attack, and the rook can no longer defend the d-pawn. Black can play Ra7 and Nxd6 is impossible because of Ba4, but after b5 intending b4, Black's rook is pretty much restricted from the a-file and trapped, if Ra2 then Qb3, so Black is subject to loss of material. Black's only advantage is the kingside space, so he must milk it for all it's worth, and ignore White's threats on the queenside.} g3 {White playing h3 now may transpose into the actual game, but White greedily jumped at the chance to take the rook.} 24. Nxa6 {recovering lost material with bxa6 is a horrible move, because Black is only focused on the kingside attack, and can ignore White's queenside play, even if it means accepting the loss of the rook. Baker thinks he is in trouble, so it's do or die on the kingside from here.} Ne8 {This move both defends d6, while preparing to attack with Qh4. It actually seems like Black is good here since there is loads of pressure on the kingside, and White's material advantage is not exploitable in a position where almost every piece is still on the board. After Black's rook is gone, White's queenside doesn't seem dangerous anymore, it was just the pressure on the rook that was dangerous.} 25. h3 {hxg3 is suicide after fxg3 followed by Qh4. White would've had to play h3 anyway after Black plays Qh4, so he might as well play it now. Black's only way of breaking through is sacrificing more material with Qh4 Bxh3. We were curious to see how much compensation Baker had for the rook, so we put this position into Rybka (a powerful chess engine like Fritz), and it said that it was winning for White, which is expected because of the material advantage, but after leaving Rybka analysing for hours, we came back and the analysis had changed to totally winning for Black, after the computer saw the attack Qh4 Bxh3, and then Black's piece infiltration Nh4-Bf6-Rg8. We couldn't believe that Rybka found no defense for White, but we didn't let the computer analyse every position in-depth, so it's possible that Baker misplayed the attack and given White a defensive resource at some point. It is amazing that White is up a rook in this position, yet a chess engine claims that this is -  "totally winning for Black"} Qh4 26. Rc2 {White knows Bxh3 is coming, so this predefends g2 after Bd3} Bxh3 27. gxh3 Qxh3 {The text move Bd3 was White's intent when he played Rc2. Another defensive option is Rf2 giving back the sacrificed material, but that just opens up White's king, and Black can choose to recover all the material since a6 is still hanging.} 28. Bd3 Nh4 {White can't stop g2, then Bf6 and Rg8 are coming to increase the pressure, while White's pieces are pretty much useless to defend, and a material advantage is only important when the extra material is actually attacking.} 29. Nc5 {White reactivates the knight and dxc5?? is a blunder because the e-pawn hangs and White can afford to sacrifice a piece because of what Black has sacrificed} g2 30. Nxb7 {White wants Baker to take the rook, so that he can finally relieve the pressure around the king, and still be up a piece, and now White has a passed pawn and Nxd6 ideas. I think White has better defensive options like Kf2 or Re1, instead of still attacking on the queenside. After Re1, Nxf3 is not advisable because of Qxf3 and White has enough pieces for the queen.} Bf6 {This move clears the way for Rg8, where Black would threaten mate, so White played Kf2 to try and avoid that. Since Rff2 loses to mate, Re1 is the only way White can save the rook. That defense fails since play could continue 31.Re1 Nxf3  32.Qxf3 Qh1  33.Kf2 Bh4  and White is lost because 34.Ke2 loses to Qxe1# and 34.Qg3 loses to Bxg3  35.Kf3 g1=N# double-check and mate. (35.Ke2 still loses to Qxe1#) Play could also continue 31.Re1 Nxf3  32.Kf2 Bh4  33.Ke2 Bxe1 and White will have to sacrifice the queen to stop g1=N# not to mention Black can promote to a queen after.} 31. Kf2 {If White takes d6 with either knight, then Black plays 32...Rg8 threatening promotion mate (after Nf7  Kh7 White's knights can't do anything) White plays Re1 to stop gxf1, then Black plays Nxf3 with the exact same mating attack explained last move where Black promotes to knight to mate, or the variation where White has to sacrifice the queen to prevent the pawn from knighting, in which Black promotes to queen after that and has a massive material advantage} Rg8 {This threatens 32...g1=Q 33.Rxg1 Qh2  34.Ke1 Rxg1  35.Bf1 Ng2  White is lost, and play could continue 36.Rxg2 Qxg2 where Black has almost caught up in material and the tactical threats such as Bh4  and Rxf1# will cause Black to gain more material. After 35...Ng2 , White could also move the king to the 2nd rank instead of taking with rook, Black plays 36...Ne3  winning in any case. If White's king ends up getting to c1 like after 36.Kd2 Ne3  37.Kc1, then Rxf1 threatens Rxd1# and Qxc2# and Black will gain more material than was sacrificed. If White's king ends up getting to c3 after Ne3 , then the simple Nxd1  gains back more material than was sacrificed, since Black already gained a rook after Qh2  If White's king goes back to e1 after Ne3 , then the knight is attacking the f1-bishop so Rxf1# is mate.} 32. Rg1 Rg3 {The idea is to play Nxf3 and possibly Bh4 with some dangerous tactical threats such as  discovered check, and pawn promotion possibilities, and 33.Be2 won't really defend the pawn because of Nxf3 Bxf3 Bh4 (Threatening Rxf3  Ke2 Rf2  Ke1 Rxc2 discovered mate), White can only stop that threat with Ke2, then Rxf3 with the same threat, and White's king is helpless against all of Baker's tactics.} 33. Ke2 Nxf3 {Finally a piece can come in to attack the blocker of the pawn, and White's rook better not move because Black simply promotes and then the queen and rook come in for the kill} 34. Nbxd6 {Perhaps White should've tried this annoying counterplay earlier, but it's too late now, Black will succeed in either promotion, or completing the mating attack.} Nxg1+ {If White moves his king, then Black has many winning moves, like simply moving the knight back and then promoting.} 35. Qxg1 {Rxd3 might win faster, but I think f3  is less risky} f3+ {It's pretty much over now. White's king can be kicked off f2 with Bh4, so the king cannot stop promotion, and Qh1 is an idea.} 36. Kd2 {The king is too vulnerable to stop the pawns. White's only chance is Rc1,  which is the only other piece that can defend the promotion square.} Nxd6 {Black shouldn't play Qh1 because Qxh1 gxh1=Q Nxe8 and White has 3 pieces for the queen, and Black's other pawn cannot promote, Black should just snap off this knight first so that White only gets 2 pieces for the queen.} 37. Ne3 {After Nxd6 Qh1 Rc1 Black has Bg5  and the rook is gone, then White has Bxe5  winning Black's rook, but promotion is unstoppable without White's rook, so Ne3 is White's best chance. If Rc1 instead of Ne3, then Black can snap off the knight defending that diagonal.} f2 {This is the only way Black can force promotion} 38. Qxf2 g1=Q {Black has succeeded in promoting, but now he has his king to worry about.} 39. Qxf6+ Rg7 {White will soon run out of checks} 40. Qh6+ Kg8 {Now White's only check is Qe6  forcing queen trade. If White makes a defensive move like Nd1, then he has underestimated the power of the major pieces against White's exposed king} 41. Qe6+ Qxe6 42. dxe6 {This is critical. White has two pieces and a pawn for the queen, usually material advantages where the stronger side has less pieces are harder to exploit, and White is threatening Bxe5} Qf2+ 43. Be2 Re7 {Nxe4 isn't good right now, Black really needs to block or remove this pawn} 44. Kd3 {This threatens Bxh5, better than taking e5, which just opens the position more for Black's major pieces.} h4 {This pawn is very valuable, and Bxe5 is nothing to worry about, without the passed h-pawn, White could maybe manage a draw.} 45. Bxe5 Rxe6 46. Bg4 {White can hold on longer by going all out to stop the h-pawn, and the position is more complicated for Black to figure out how to win, but the advantage of queen vs. knight and bishop is enough to win even without pawns.} Qxc2+ {But White didn't realize that this trade wins more simply for Black} 47. Nxc2 {I think Kxc2 was better} Rxe5 {White's only chance to draw is to stop or win the h-pawn} 48. Bf3 {The bishop is the only thing stopping promotion, so Black must somehow block the diagonal or force the bishop away} Rg5 {This move prevents White's king from ever crossing the g-file, Black must make sure that his pawn cannot be won, otherwise being up an exchange is not enough to win. } 49. Ke3 h3 50. Kf4 Rg1 {Black controls the promotion square, now all he has to do is contain the pawns.} 51. e5 {Black needs to be careful of this pawn, if the knight gets close then White may be able to force promotion} Nb5 52. e6 h2 53. Ke5 {if e7, then Kf7, and if Bd5, then Kf8} h1=Q 54. Bxh1 Rxh1 55. Kf6 {All Black has to do now is remove the pawns, which must be done precisely or White could hold a draw} Rh7 {This stops Ke7, which might be good enough to hold a draw} 56. Ne3 {If e7, then Rh6  forces the king away and Black can stop and win the pawn, this would be much harder to win if White's knight was a bishop, since he could waste moves and not get into zugswang that easily. But the knight is better than the bishop at helping pawns promote, which is White's last chance to swindle} Nd6 {This knight must stop the strong passed pawn} 57. Nd5 Ne8+ 58. Kg6 Rb7 {this could be considered zugswang, White would probably prefer to pass his turn if he could} 59. e7 Rb5 60. Nf4 {After Nf6  Nxf6 Kxf6 Rb6  Black can win both pawns and it's easy win after that.} Rxb4 61. Nd5 Rd4 62. Ne3 {After Nf6 Nxf6 Kxf6 Re4 Black stops and wins the pawn} Re4 63. Nd5 Re5 64. Nf4 Rxe7 {This seems like resignable position, but it could still be tricky to win, especially since both players were in time pressure} 65. Kf5 Kf7 66. Nd5 Re1 {The technique is simple, Black uses zugswang tactics to force the king away, Black just has to use simple chess logic and the game wins itself.} 67. Nf4 Nd6+ {Here Baker stopped writing his moves down because of time pressure, but I'll continue the game just for fun.} 68. Kg4 Rf1 69. Nh3 Kf6 70. Nf4 Ke5 71. Nd3+ Ke4 72. Nc5+ Ke3 73. Ne6 Rg1+ 74. Kh5 Ke4 75. Kh4 Nf5+ 76. Kh3 {Kh6 allows knight trade} Kf3 77. Kh2 Rg4 {Now the win is clear and White will get mated in a few moves. If Kh1 then Kf2 followed by Rh4#, and against knight moves, Rh4  Kg1 Ng3 and Black plays Rh1# next move. If you liked this game, then check out bakerbaker's annotations with a lot of attacking games }
