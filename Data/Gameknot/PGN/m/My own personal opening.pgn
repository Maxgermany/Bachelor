[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed, Korchnoi variation"]

1. e4 {So we are all familiar with 1...c5, the Sicilian Defense. I use the Sicilian reguarly, or at least since my coach hammered it into me. I used to play 1...e5. My coach, a 2nd catagory player rated in the high 1900's, taught me the Sicilian. He said the only way to beat it was to learn it. At that time, I had been having a losing streak against the Sicilian.} c5 2. Nc3 e6 {Right here I go into my own personal variation of the Sicilian, which I call "The Fabian French". I haven't played it in any real matchs, only in fun ones. Super Ninja is a personal friend of mine, so we were joking around with this game. If this is a real opening, can someone please notify me of it? Please and thank you.} 3. f4 {He continues with his original plan, the Grand Prix Attack. This move was taught to me by my coach, and I taught it to Ninja.} d5 {So here is where the opening derives its name. It is a hybrid of the Sicilian and the French. White couldn't start off with 2. d5 because of the 1... c5, so he doesn't have his perfect center.} 4. d3 dxe4 5. dxe4 Qxd1+ 6. Nxd1 Nf6 7. e5 Nd5 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bc4 b5 10. Bxd5 exd5 {Now Black has a better center than White, but not by much.  He's solved the problem of the French Bishop.} 11. b3 f6 12. c4 bxc4 13. bxc4 d4 {A much better move than accepting the pawn sacrifice.} 14. Nf2 fxe5 15. fxe5 Nc6 16. Nf3 O-O-O 17. O-O Re8 18. Re1 {I now am trying to build up pressure on his e-pawn.} g6 19. Bf4 Bg7 20. Nd3 Bg4 21. Nxc5 Bxf3 22. gxf3 Nxe5 23. Bxe5 Rxe5 24. Rxe5 Bxe5 25. Re1 Re8 {Now the pressure is on my Bishop rather than his pawn.} 26. Ne4 Kd7 27. Nc5+ Kc6 28. Ne4 a5 29. Nf6 {A blunder.} Bxh2+ 30. Kf1 Rxe1+ 31. Kxe1 {I am now up a pawn.} Kc5 32. Nxh7 Kxc4 33. Kf2 d3 34. Ke3 Bf4+ 35. Kf2 d2 36. Ke2 Kc3 37. Kd1 a4 38. Nf6 Kb2 39. Nd5 Bh6 40. Nb4 Ka3 41. Nd5 Kxa2 42. Kc2 g5 43. Kxd2 g4+ 44. Ke2 gxf3+ 45. Kxf3 Kb2 46. Ke4 a3 47. Kd3 {The pawn Queens no matter what.} a2 48. Nc3 a1=Q 49. Kc4 Kc2 50. Kb4 Qxc3+ 51. Ka4 Qb2 52. Ka5 Be3 53. Ka6 Qb6# {The final position was one I enjoyed. I'm glad my opening turned out well in this game, but it still needs work.}
