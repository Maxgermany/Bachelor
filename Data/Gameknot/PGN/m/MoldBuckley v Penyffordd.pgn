1. Nf3 {My opponent starts with Reti's move} d5 {I play a common reply. Afterwards on the databases I found that Nf6 is actually more popular, although d5 scores better.} 2. d4 {Reti used to continue with c4. g3 is the most common move here, d4 is second, followed by c4} c5 {This looked the most aggressive, the best chance to seize the initiative. Nf6, c6 and e6 are all more common.} 3. c3 {This seemed to me to be a passive reply. Afterwards I found that c4 and e3 are more popular and score better.} e6 {This seemed best, I didn't like the idea of him taking on c5 and following up with b4.} 4. g3 {This again is rather passive. Bf4, e3 and Bg5 are more popular, and in my view, better.} Nc6 {I thought it logical to bring out this knight, although Nf6 is slightly more popular.} 5. Bg2 {The logical follow-up to his last move.} Bd6 {I decided to delay the development of this bishop, I was dreaming of maybe playing Ne7, 0-0, f6 and e5.} 6. O-O {Again logical development by white} Nf6 {I wish I had had the courage to continue with my plan. There are two games on the database with this, both black wins! At the time I was worried about white getting in an early e4} 7. Bg5 {So white pins the knight} h6 {Black attacks the bishop} 8. Bxf6 {of course retreat to h4 loses a piece to g5, so exchanging is more or less forced, although on the database there are a few games where white retreated the bishop to c1, d2 or f4.} Qxf6 {Black cannot allow his pawns to become weaker.} 9. Nbd2 {White makes a blunder that drops a pawn} cxd4 {So I take it! Now 10. cxd4 Nxd4 11. Qa4+ Nc6 12. e4 O-O 13. exd5 exd5 14. Qb3 Be6 15. Qxb7 Rfc8 16. Rac1 Rab8 17. Qa6 Rb6 18. Qa4 Qxb2 19. Rc2 Qb4 20. Qxb4 Nxb4 21. Rxc8+ Bxc8 22. Re1 Bb7 23. Nb3 Nxa2 24. Na5 Bc6 25. Nd4 Nc3 26. Bf3 Rb2 27. h4 Bb5 28. Re8+ Kh7 29. Ndc6 Bc5 30. h5 Rd2 31. Bg4 Bd4 32. Bf5+ g6 33. hxg6+ fxg6 34. Re7+ Bg7 35. Be6 Ne4 36. f4 Nxg3 37. Ne5 Bf1 38. Bxd5 Rxd5 39. Kf2 Nf5 40. Rxa7 Bb5 41. Ng4 Rd7 0-1 was Campos Alexandr… (2114) vs. Oliveira Jeffer… (2289). My opponent finds an improvement, which takes us out of the databases.} 10. c4 {Much better than meekly losing a pawn.} dxc4 {I can't allow my d pawns to become doubled.} 11. Ne4 {This is another excellent move, better than the obvious Nxc4, when e5 or retreating my bishop leaves me an extra pawn up.} Qe7 {I had to retreat to e7 or d8. I considered this move better, as if I play d8, in some variations the queens get exchanged on the d file and my under-development is exposed.} 12. Nxd4 {and now he is threatening to exchange on c6 and then take on d6, so I move my bishop to the most active square} Be5 13. Nxc6 {White exchanges and weakens my pawn formation} bxc6 {after dropping the pawn, white has fought back well, and even has an edge now} 14. Nf6+ {I was expecting this!} Kf8 {I could have taken the knight. After Bxf6 15. Bxc6+ Bd7 16. Bxa8 O-O bishop moves and then I take on b2. With pawn and bishop for rook, black is doing ok, but I thought the game continuation was ok. I probably was, and my mistake was later on. } 15. Bxc6 {Hitting the rook} Rb8 {Now he has to move his knight} 16. Ng4 Bxb2 17. Rb1 e5 {hitting his knight} 18. Ne3 Bh3 {hitting the rook} 19. Re1 Qc7 {The idea is to protect the rook, so I can move my bishop. I hoped to win the exchange with Bc3. Of course my opponent saw this threat too.} 20. Qd5 Be6 {So I bring my bishop back to defend c4} 21. Qc5+ Qe7 {Now if he exchanges I can at last develop my R(h8)} 22. Qa5 {So he doesn't go in for that.} g6 {There is a certain logic to this move, I wanted to play Kg7 and develop R(h8). Unfortunately it leaves on a tactical blow.} 23. Rxb2 Rxb2 24. Qxe5 Qa3 25. Qxh8+ Ke7 26. Rd1 {With a horrible mating threat. Thanks for reading this, please rate my annotation and leave some comments!}
