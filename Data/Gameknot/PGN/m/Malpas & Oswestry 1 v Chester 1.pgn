1. d4 {This is so similar to my last game with Danny http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/chester-1-v-malpas-oswestry-1?gm=62327 once again he plays the Dutch Defence, I get an overwhelming position, but make a blunder giving him the win.} f5 {He plays the Dutch Defence again.} 2. g3 {The most popular reply.} g6 {He does similar.} 3. Bg2 {I complete the fianchetto} Bg7 {So does he.} 4. Nc3 {My knight comes out.} Nf6 {As does his.} 5. e4 {e2-e4 comes in again.} fxe4 {This time he takes.} 6. Nxe4 {I take back.} Nxe4 {He takes.} 7. Bxe4 {I take back.} d5 {He attacks my bishop.} 8. Bg2 {Bishop retreats.} O-O {He castles.} 9. c3 {Aimed to blunt his Bg7.} c6 {Presumably likewise.} 10. Bf4 {I set out to control his weak square on e5.} b6 {This looks a little slow to me.} 11. Nf3 {Again, taking control of the e5 square, making it very hard for him to play e7-e5.} Ba6 {He stops me from castling king side.} 12. Qd2 {So I prepare to castle queen side.} Nd7 {He finally develops his knight. I am surprised Fritz likes black's position. I like white's.} 13. O-O-O {I castle } Nf6 {His knight comes across.} 14. Ne5 {So I occupy e5 and also prepare to exchange on e4 if ever he occupies it. Fritz prefers 14. Ng5 aiming for Ne6.} Qc8 {Supporting the Ba6} 15. h4 {So I start my king side operations.} e6 {Plugging the weakness on e6, but restricting the influence of his queen.} 16. g4 {Continuing with my king side advances.} c5 {He counters on the queen side.} 17. dxc5 {Fritz prefers continuing with the king side attack 17. h5, but I decided to take.} Qxc5 {He takes back.} 18. g5 {I go after the exchange. Fritz prefers 18. h5} Nh5 {His knight moves.} 19. Nd7 {His knight was protecting this square, but now that the knight is gone....} Qe7 {Fritz prefers 17....Bxc3} 20. Nxf8 {So I take the rook.} Nxf4 {He takes my bishop.} 21. Qxf4 {I take back.} Rxf8 {He takes my knight. Now - where would you move the queen dear reader? Surprisingly, Fritz gives black the advantage, although he is the exchange down.} 22. Qg3 {This is a mistake, much better is 22. Qe3 making it harder for him to generate play on the queen side.} Qc5 {Suddenly I didn't like my position any more - he seemed to have big threats on the queen side.} 23. Bf1 {So I decide to try and exchange some pieces.} Bxf1 {He takes.} 24. Rhxf1 {I take back, protecting my f2 pawn at the same time.} d4 {But his attack rolls forward.} 25. Rd3 {I need to protect c3 again.} dxc3 {He takes.} 26. bxc3 {I take back.} Qa3+ {He throws in a check.} 27. Kb1 {I decide to stay protecting the a2 pawn.} Rf5 {With the horrible threat of Rb5+ winning. Luckily I have a move first.} 28. Rd8+ {Throwing in a check.} Bf8 {Bishop comes back.} 29. Qd3 {And now both b5 and Rd8 are protected. I began to feel OK again.} Qc5 {He attacks f2 again.} 30. f4 {So I advance it.} Qc6 {Preparing Rb5+ again.} 31. Rf2 {But now I am ready to defend along the 2nd rank.} a6 {He could - and should - have picked up the h pawn here with Qh1+} 32. a3 {I am not sure why I played this.} Qc5 {He forks pawn on a3 and rook on f2.} 33. Qe2 {This defends Rf2 and attacks e6.} Qxa3 {He takes.} 34. Qxe6+ {I take with check.} Kh8 {King runs into the corner. He is now threatening to take on c3} 35. c4 {So I advance. Although my king position looks wide open, as his is also open, I am OK.} Qc3 {I think he is still hoping for some sort of attack on my king.} 36. Rc2 {So I bring my rook over.} Qg7 {And his queen goes all the way back.} 37. Qxb6 {So I take a pawn.} Rxf4 {So does he.} 38. Rf2 {I oppose his rook. Of course, if he moves the rook along the 4th rank I have Rxf8+ winning, so he is forced to exchange.} Rxf2 {So he takes.} 39. Qxf2 {I take back, threating his bishop.} Kg8 {And this is the only way to defend.} 40. c5 {White is clearly winning. I am the exchange up and the c pawn is going to take some stopping.} Qe7 {He attacks my rook. Now simply Qa2+ wins easily.} 41. Rb8 {But I move my rook. I notice that I could not move my rook to a8 or c8 because of a fork on b7, but I thought, wrongly, that on b8 I avoided the forks.} Qe4+ {He checked. Now simply Kc1 and I am winning easily again, but...} 42. Kb2 {Oh dear.} Qe5+ {Oops! The game is now lost, no need for further comment.} 43. Ka3 Qxb8 44. Qd4 Qc7 45. Kb4 Qxc5+ 46. Qxc5 Bxc5+ 47. Kxc5 Kf7 48. Kb6 Ke6 49. Kxa6 Kf5 50. Kb5 Kg4 51. Kc4 Kxh4 52. Kd4 Kxg5 53. Ke4 {And white resigns. Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the start system to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
