1. e4 c5 {Turns into a Sicilian Defense.} 2. d4 {The Smith-Morra Gambit, usual for Morphy, because he plays the Sicilian a lot.} cxd4 3. Nf3 Nc6 {Puts more pressure on the square d4 and protects the pawn.} 4. Nxd4 {White captures it anyway since the Q is protecting the N.} e6 {A highly unusual move.} 5. Nb5 {What is Morphy thinking about !?} d6 {This is better than ...a6; but even now the King's Bishop is shut in, and the Queen's Pawn rendered weak.} 6. Bf4 {Correctly played, compelling the advance of the e-Pawn, which leaves the Queen's Pawn weak and unsupported.} e5 7. Be3 f5 {...a6 would have been sounder play, but even then the game would have been in favor of the first player.} 8. Nb1c3 {A fine conception.} f4 9. Nd5 fxe3 10. Nbc7+ Kf7 11. Qf3+ Nf6 12. Bc4 {The attack is now irresistible.} Nd4 13. Nxf6+ d5 {If the Bishop had been interposed, White would have taken it, checking; and on Knight retaking have played Nd5 discovering check, and won without difficulty.} 14. Bxd5+ Kg6 {Had the Queen captured the Bishop, White would have taken with the Knight, discovering check, and have remained eventually with a Pawn ahead and a winning position.} 15. Qh5+ Kxf6 16. fxe3 { Ne8+, seemingly a good move, is only in appearance, as Black might have taken it when placed there; and on White taking Queen, have answered with ...Bb4+, obtaining a winning game.} Nxc2+ 17. Ke2 {Black Resigns, A wonderful game Played by Morphy.}
