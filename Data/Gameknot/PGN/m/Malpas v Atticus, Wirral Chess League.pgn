1. d4 {This was a very lucky win. He comes up with a winning combination, but at a crucial moment, he quickly makes an instinctive capture. This turns out to be a mistake. I end up with two queens, trying to avoid a perpetual check, which I do. The question is - could he have played the final position better - could he have got a perpetual? Please let me know your thoughts dear reader!} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 O-O 6. Be3 {So once again, he plays the King's Indian Defence, and I play the SÃ¤misch Variation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence,_S%C3%A4misch_Variation} e5 {He continues with the main line.} 7. d5 {I close the centre.} Nh5 {This is common too, preparing f7-f5 and/or Nf4.} 8. Bd3 {This is a mistake. next time I will stick to the main line and play Qd1-d2} Nf4 {Knight comes in, also hitting g2} 9. Qd2 {So I protect g2.} Bh6 {This threatens Nxg2 again, but I am not sure it is correct. On the Gameknot opening databases Nxd3 and f7-f5 have been tried.} 10. O-O-O {Now taking on g2 with his knight, just loses a bishop.} Nd7 {Ok, stop and see if you can find White's next move?} 11. Bf1 {Did you find it? The point is that white now has he threat of g2-g3. I did toy with the idea of Kb1 or Bc2 with the same threat. I will tell you after the next move, why I played Bf1 instead, but first now find black's next move!} Bg7 {Did you find it? The only other defence g5 runs into 12.g3	Ng6 13. h4	f6 14.	Nh3 and black is losing a pawn. If instead on 11. Bf1 I had played Kb1, then black could have played Nd-c5 with tempo first, attacking my Bd3. After I see to that threat, the final Nh3 is less strong as he can meet Nh3 with Bc8xh3. In the same way, if I had retreated my bishop to c2, he could have played Nb6 with tempo, as it attacks my pawn on c4, and again his Bc8 can capture on h3.} 12. g3 {I only considered taking on f4 very briefly. It is a usual pawn sacrifice in the King's Indian. White would give up his best minor piece, his dark squared bishop and black is ready to exploit the weak black squares. The position is so much easier to play for black. After 12. Bxf4 exf4 13.	Qxf4	f5, his knight has lovely squares on c5, e5 or f6.} Nh5 {So his knight drops back.} 13. Bd3 {I develop again.} f5 {The usual break is made.} 14. Nge2 {I develop.} Nc5 {He hits d3} 15. Bc2 {I retreat.} fxe4 {He takes.} 16. Nxe4 {This is played with a view of getting my other knight to c3.} Rxf3 {This was a bit of a surprise} 17. Nxc5 {So I take his knight.} dxc5 {He takes back.} 18. Bxc5 {I recapture my pawn.} b6 {He hits my bishop.} 19. Be4 {I decided to try and gain a tempo by hitting his rook. He next move was a complete surprise to me, but it should have won him the game!} bxc5 {This is the surprise!} 20. Bxf3 {I take his rook. Stop and find his next move please.} Qf8 {He hits my bishop.} 21. Rhf1 {I protect} Bh6 {I didn't see this move. This is why Qf8 is played rather than Qf6. Did you spot Qf8. Now there is only one move to save my queen.} 22. Nf4 {And this is it!} exf4 {He played this quickly. It is the natural move to play. You normally should take with the weakest piece first. It is a massive mistake! After the game, my opponent stopped that Nxf4!! instead is much stronger. Analysing later with a friend, David Thomas, we found lines like Nxf4 23. Kb1 Bf5+ 24. Ka1 Ne6 25. Qe1 Nd4 26. Qxe5 Nc2+ 27. Kb1 Bg7 28.Qxc7 Rb8, winning for black. OK, stop and find white's next move.} 23. d6 {Did you find it? The point is that fxg3 is met by Bd5+ and white wins. Rb8 is met with d7 which wins a bishop as if he moves his bishop to b7 or a6, I play d7-d8=q and wins. So what did he play?} Nf6 {I think this is his best move, as the knight covers d5 and d7 and fxg3 is threatened again.} 24. gxf4 {So I have to take this pawn.} Bh3 {I think this is a mistake and simply Rb8 may be OK for him.} 25. Bxa8 {I take} Bxf1 {He takes. I did consider playing Bd5+ here, which is also strong, but what I played was good enough.} 26. Rxf1 {I took.} Qxa8 {He takes back.} 27. dxc7 {And now this pawn is queening.} Kg7 {Kf7 may be an improvement, so that after I queen, I am not threatening mate. Also it takes the e7 square away from me.} 28. Qd8 {So I play queen in.} Qe4 {His queen comes in.} 29. c8=Q {I get a second queen.} Qxc4+ {He checks. There is only one square now which doesn't lose the rook with check.} 30. Kd2 {So I played king to this square. The question is - what happens now after Bxf4+ - has he got a perpetual check or not? After the game with Luke, we found ways out of the checks, but looking at it later with David Thomas, we were unable to find ways out. What do you think dear reader? Has anyone time to run this game through a computer and find out if white is winning in this position?} Qb4+ {Anyway, he checked here instead.} 31. Kd1 {And now he resigned, as after Qa4 check, b3 and he has run out of checks and I am threatening my own mate. Please rate this game on the star system and leave a comment or two. I hope you enjoyed this game!}
