1. e4 {My first game here at GameKnot against a stranger that left me we the opinion that there are people out there who really can't work with their queen and king.He created an opening for me and left me execute a plan I never had thoughts about.I wanted all my games here to be a lesson for me.I guess this is the first one.Thank you for having me.For post game analysis see  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17962790&fb=1&rnd=0.4623998647473022} e5 {These are one of the few opening responses I know that work for me. :D} 2. Qh5 {His First violation of the principles.} Nc6 {I wanted to keep my central pawn and develop a good knight.} 3. Bb5 {And Here starts cat and mouse chain mistakes. Next move Nf6.} Nf6 {Getting rid of his queen.} 4. Qf3 {That wasn't a bad way to run.} Nd4 {Creating one of my favorite tools in chess - the fork.} 5. Qc3 {Big blunder that I dint even count on.Second mistake after the BishopB5.} Nxe4 {There we have two central knights. Lol! :D} 6. Qc4 {Third Mistake and here I become overconfident. I played Qg5.} Qg5 {Going for the G pawn. My first Mistake that I found to be one after the game analysis. My opponent dint turn it into profit. I guess he dint see it or just ignored it.} 7. Nf3 {Kf1 was better...} Qxg2 {I took the pawn.} 8. Rg1 {Here something flashed. My advanced Knights with the upcoming fork Nf3. I looked deeper for a chance. :D I jumped to the analyze tool and it was there. All of whites turns become forced for the next 11 moves or so. Mate in 11. See the post game analysis.} Nxf3+ {Check} 9. Ke2 {His best move at the time. :D} Nxg1+ {I talked to him about it and he seem to have give up on the next move.} 10. Ke3 {Mate in 1.} Qf3# {Checkmate. Lesson learned.}
