1. e4 {i had to annotate this one... my best move...} c5 {we're on sicilian...} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a5 {?! off regular, and the first time 5... a5 has been played against me... turns out this was an error, he meant to play the regular 5... a6 but submitted this one... } 6. Bb5+ {well let's take advantage of his weakness... bishop or knight there will be a problem for him...} Bd7 {best...} 7. O-O Bxb5 {not sure if this was best, but not too damaging... } 8. Ncxb5 {! better than the less attacking N(d)xb5... offers a pawn...} Nxe4 {? and he accepts the gambit, assuming it a mistake... now he's in trouble... } 9. Re1 {! and his knight is lost... does he know it...?} Nc5 {? no he doesn't... and why should the knight have fallen...?} 10. Nc6 {!! and his underdevelopment is his downfall... his queen is lost...  10... bxc6 11. Nxd6+  Kd7 12. Nxb7+ 10... Nxc6 11. Nxd6+  Kd7 12. Nxb7+  10... Qb6 11. Nxd6+  Kd7/Kd8 12. Nc4+  10... Qc8 11. Nxd6+  10... Qd7 11. Nxd6+  Qxd6 12. Qxd6  of course, failing to capture knight or move the queen results in immediate queen loss...  naturally, my opponent resigned here, aware he is lost already...  note the development difference... i have developed rook and queen, plus two knights, and i have castled, while he is yet to move a kingside pawn, and has developed just a knight...   i wonder if anyone has fallen into this trap before...?}
