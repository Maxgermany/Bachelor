[Opening "King's Indian (A48), East Indian defence"]

1. d4 {In this game my opponent unleashed a surprising early piece sacrifice which had me worried, but thankfully I seemed to navigate the complications better than him!} Nf6 {So I head for an Indian set-up} 2. Nf3 {He also develops his King's Knight} g6 {I prepare to fianchetto my bishop.} 3. Nc3 {A little bit unusual, presumably hoping for 4. e4 and a Modern Defence set-up.} d5 {But I put a stop to that.} 4. Bf4 {His bishop comes out.} Nh5 {I attack his bishop} 5. Bg5 {His bishop advances} h6 {I attack his bishop again.} 6. Bh4 {His bishop drops back.} g5 {I attack again, slightly weakening my King-side position, but driving his bishop back} 7. Bg3 {It duly drops back.} Bf5 {Played to prevent e2-e4 and with the idea of dropping back to g6 and covering some of the weak squares on my king-side.} 8. e3 {So he plays it to e3 instead.} Bg7 {I at last finish the finachetto.} 9. Be5 {He offers an exchange of bishops.} f6 {I block. I was expecting his bishop to roll back to g3 now, but instead he gave me a shock with.....(you may want to pause here and consider what other move white could possibly make?)} 10. Nh4 {Now if I take the knight then he gets two pieces back - 10....gxh4 11. Qxh5+ and if 11...Kd7 he takes on f5 with check, or if I play Kf8 after Qxf5 my pawn on f6 is pinned. Fritz gives white an advantage of plus 1.81 here.} Be6 {After considering 10...0-0 and 10....Bxc2, Fritz finally comes up with this move - which I played. I was really worried about 11. Ng6 here, and Fritz agrees, it is the best move for white, and gives it as plus 1.5 to white.} 11. Bxc7 {Thankfully he played this instead.} Qxc7 {I take back. Fritz thinks that white is plus 1 now, but I was confident.} 12. Qxh5+ {White gets his piece back.} Bf7 {But now queen and knight are hanging.} 13. Bb5+ {This was another surprise. } Nc6 {But I simply block.} 14. Ng6 {The only way to save a piece.} e6 {Played to protect d5 and also to play f6-f5 if necessary.} 15. Bd3 {This seems rather inconsistent. He seems to have allowed me to play Nc6 with gain of time.} f5 {Cutting off the protection of the knight.} 16. g4 {Trying to save his knight. Fritz gives a small advantage to black now.} Ne7 {Fritz prefers 16....a6 as now white can play 17. Bb5+ and if 17.....Kd8 then 18. Nf4! saving the piece, as 18....Bxh5 then 19. Nxe6+ forking my king and queen. I was thinking that if Bb5+ I would have to play my knight back to c6, but after 17. h4! white is slightly better again.} 17. gxf5 {Now plus 1 to black.} exf5 {I take back.} 18. Qf3 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} Bxg6 {So I take.} 19. Nxd5 {He gets a second pawn for the piece.} Qd6 {Fritz prefers 19....Qa5+} 20. Nxe7 {White takes.} Qxe7 {Black takes back.} 21. Bxf5 {White gets, temporarily, a third pawn, but it is poisoned!} O-O {With a nasty pin.} 22. Qd5+ {White tries to break the pin.} Bf7 {I have to keep attacking, I don't want him castling, getting his king to safety and rooks into play.} 23. Qe4 {He offers an exchange of queens.} Qb4+ {I throw in a check.} 24. Kf1 {This is another mistake, c3 was indicated.} Rae8 {Getting my last piece into play with tempo.. Black is 2 point up now, according to Fritz.} 25. Qf3 {Queen drops back.} Bg6 {Dangerous pin on the bishop. Fritz actually like Be6 instead, but I didn't want him exchanging off this vulnerable bishop.} 26. Qd5+ {He throws in a check.} Bf7 {Bishop drops back.} 27. Qf3 {Queen drops back.} Bc4+ {Rather than repeat, I throw in a check.} 28. Kg2 {King moves. Fritz here likes g5-g4 now.} Qb5 {This seemed good to me, threatening the bishop on f5 and also Bc4-d5} 29. e4 {He protects the bishop.} Bxd4 {I take the pawn.} 30. Qh5 {He attacks - maybe hoping for a perpetual check?} Rxf5 {Perhaps a bit speculative, but it worked out OK. Fritz prefers 30....Qc6 with plus 4 to black.} 31. Qg6+ {White checks.} Bg7 {My bishop comes back. Fritz gives black as plus 3.} 32. exf5 {Fritz prefers taking with the queen, but either way, black as a strong attack.} Bd5+ {Fritz gives this a plus 7 to black now.} 33. f3 {White blocks.} Qe2+ {It is mate soon now.} 34. Kg1 {King drops back.} Qe3+ {Queen check.} 35. Kg2 {King up.} Qxf3+ {Another check.} 36. Kg1 {Forced.} Qg2# {And now mate. Many thanks for reading.
