1. e4 c5 2. a3 {It seems unusual, which I usually do in my rapid games. Actually, I do not prefer the Sicilian Defense, because it will become quite complex to me in these games.} Nc6 3. c3 g6 4. d4 {I need to catch up the center, I did not know about my opponent's attitude.} cxd4 5. cxd4 Bg7 6. d5 {Another favorite thing is to make the knights uncomfortable by the center pawns.} Nd4 7. Ne2 Nxe2 8. Bxe2 Nf6 9. Nc3 a6 10. f3 d6 11. Qb3 b5 12. Be3 O-O 13. O-O e6 14. dxe6 Bxe6 {I hoped 14...fxe6 instead of that move which makes a glance towards the white queen.} 15. Qc2 Rc8 16. b4 {To prevent from a future attack with the queen-side pawns which may happen in a sudden.} Nd5 17. exd5 {I found nothing else to do to sustain the game... See whether you can locate any other move,,} Rxc3 18. Qd2 Bc8 19. Bd4 {I intended to avoid the menace from the hidden bishop.} Rc7 20. Bxg7 Kxg7 21. Qd4+ Kg8 22. Rac1 Bb7 23. Rxc7 Qxc7 24. Rd1 Re8 25. Kf2 Qe7 26. Bd3 Qe5 27. Qxe5 {Good chance to get rid of the queens, "Destroying Them"} Rxe5 28. Re1 Bxd5 {Ouch!! It made me really cold. Am I going to lose? I was feeling it.} 29. Rxe5 dxe5 30. Ke3 f5 31. f4 e4 32. Be2 Kf7 33. Kd4 {My king has to play a big role here, isn't it?} Ke6 34. Kc5 Bc4 {Hmmmm..... A chance to get a draw, what do you say?} 35. Bxc4+ bxc4 36. Kxc4 Kd6 37. a4 {Finally, he agreed to my draw offer.}
