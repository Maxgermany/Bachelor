1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  I thought that was the end of the annotating on the above theme, but no, I remember another one, against a buddy of mine (a carpenter) who left gameknot a year ago and has still not returned to the board.  Brace yourself, this game is quite a marathon, it lasted 73 moves all in all and although it looked a comprehensive victory from me at the end, boy did the game not seasaw!  White starts off with the Reti Opening, 1. Nf3.} c6 {1. ....... c6 - rather non-committal but could be a preparation for d5.} 2. g3 Nf6 3. c3 d6 4. Qb3 Qb6 5. Ng5 Qxb3 6. axb3 {6. axb3 - queen trade.} b6 7. Bg2 Bb7 {7. ....... Bb7 - a typical jstevens 1 position - the hedgehog.} 8. O-O h6 9. Nf3 e6 10. d3 Be7 {10. ........ Be7 - development behind the hedgehog.} 11. b4 a6 {11. ........ a6 - just one rank higher and that wall of pawns would have looked quite impressive!} 12. Bh3 O-O {12. ........ 0-0 - and now castles.} 13. Nbd2 Nbd7 {13. ...... Nbd7 - both sides seem very conservative with their development - difficult to see who stands better here.} 14. Re1 Rfe8 15. e4 e5 {15. ........ e5 - at last a black pawn gets on the 4th rank!} 16. Bxd7 Nxd7 {16. ...... Nxd7 - and now a piece trade.} 17. d4 f6 18. Nh4 exd4 19. cxd4 {19. cxd4 - pawn trade.} d5 20. exd5 cxd5 {20. ........ cxd5 - and another pawn trade, the position is now becoming much more open.} 21. Nf5 {21. Nf5? - loses pawn as you will see.} Bxb4 22. Rxe8+ Rxe8 23. Nf3 {23. Nf3 - I am a pawn up but those white horsies are gonna be a bit of a handful.} a5 24. Bd2 Bf8 {24. ...... Bf8 - necessary to avoid a knight fork on d6.} 25. b3 g5 26. g4 Re6 27. Kg2 Nb8 {27. ..... Nb8 - a retreat to its home square but there is some purpose in this, next move the horsie will jump to a6.} 28. Kg3 Na6 29. h4 Kf7 {29. ...... Kf7? - I walk into a tactical melee which nearly costs me the game.} 30. hxg5 hxg5 31. Bxg5 {31. Bxg5 - a pseudo sacrifice.} fxg5 32. Nxg5+ {32. Nxg5+ - a fork but luckily I will end up with 2 pieces for the rook.} Kf6 33. Nxe6 Kxe6 {33. ..... Kxe6 - material is even but look at those kingside passers!} 34. f4 Nb4 35. Ne3 Nc6 36. Re1 Kd6 {36. ..... Kd6 - necessary to avoid a nasty discovery on the e column.} 37. Nf5+ Kd7 38. g5 {38. g5 - pawn roll, can I stop the Wicked Witch of the West making an appearance?  Read on.} Ne7 39. Nh4 {39. Nh4 - avoiding a knight trade.} Ng8 40. f5 Bg7 41. Nf3 b5 {41. ..... b5 - trying for some counterplay on the queenside.} 42. Ne5+ Kd6 43. Nf7+ Kd7 44. Nh6 {44. Nh6? - I think this is a mistake as this just drops a pawn and I now have only one kingside passer to deal with.} Nxh6 45. gxh6 Bxh6 {45. ....... Bxh6 - and the bishop pair against a rook.} 46. Kg4 Bg7 47. Kg5 Bxd4 {47. ...... Bxd4 - I may have to give up Fou Lenoir for the kingside passer but I may get enough pawns for the exchange.} 48. f6 Bc5 49. f7 a4 50. bxa4 bxa4 {50. ........ Bxa4 - now I have 2 passers of my own, one on the d file and one on the a file.} 51. Kg6 a3 {51. ...... a3 - and now my a pawn is only 2 squares away from Glendadom!} 52. Kg7 Ba6 {52. ....... Ba6 - Fou Leblanc is preparing to protect the d5 pawn and support a pawn move to a7.} 53. Rd1 Bc4 54. Ra1 {54. Ra1 - blocking my a pawn but I move it to a2 anyway.} a2 55. f8=N+ {55. f8/N+ - underpromoting to a knight.  Fou Lenoir now gives his life for the knight but never mind, I will have two lovely well protected passers for the exchange.  Now all I need is for Henry to do a route march to help one of my passers to Glendadom.} Bxf8+ 56. Kxf8 Ke6 57. Ke8 Ke5 {57. ..... Ke5 - Henry marches onwards and upwards!} 58. Kd7 Kd4 59. Kd6 Kc3 {59. ...... Kc3 - Henry is aiming to drive out the rook in the corner so that I can crown my a pawn.} 60. Kc5 Kb2 61. Rd1 a1=Q {61. ....... a1/Q - Glenda appears on the board in a puff of smoke - white decided to preserve his rook for counterplay.} 62. Rd2+ Kc3 63. Rg2 Qa5+ {63. ...... Qa5+ - Glenda is trying to manoeuvre the WR and WK into a fork, pin or skewer.} 64. Kd6 Qb6+ 65. Ke5 Qd4+ {65. ...... Ke5 - Glenda is trying to drive the white king into open territory so it is easier to fork him and his castle.} 66. Kd6 Kb4 67. Kc6 Qc5+ {67. ........ Qc5+ - hang on, can I get a checkmate here?} 68. Kb7 d4 {68. ...... d4 - threatens Qd5+ winning the WR.} 69. Rd2 Kc3 70. Rxd4 Qxd4 {70. ........ Qxd4 - what's this, what's this, is white playing for a stalemate - must be careful here.  At least I am guaranteed a high draw but I wanna win!} 71. Kc7 Qf6 72. Kb7 Bg8 {72. ...... Bg8 - Fou Leblanc moves right out of the way.  In order to reduce the possibility of the wrong kind of mate he will stand by and let Henry and Glenda get on with the job.} 73. Kc7 Qe6 {73. ...... Qe6 -  Glenda is trying to nudge the WK to the side of the board.  Henry will close in until he opposes the WK, then Glenda will give the WK the kiss of death.  My opponent sees this and waves the white flag.  Whew, another game that I could have lost was won - this victory resulted in a 13 point upsurge in my rating.  Lovely!  If there is a Part 6 I will let you know!  Bye for now.  Joanne}
