1. d4 {If I'm going to play someone really strong, I'll start with what I know.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e3 e5 4. Bxc4 exd4 5. exd4 {I feel my position is pretty good still even though I have an isolated pawn.} Nf6 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Bg5 {Bigpeta identified this as a mistake as he can play Re8+.} Re8+ 9. Be3 Nbd7 {I'm not criticizing his move, but doesn't this block in his bishop?} 10. O-O Nb6 {Well his bishop is unblocked, but is his knight any better placed than on c6?} 11. Bd3 {At this point I was feeling okay with my position. I have a slight lead in development, and I don't have any real problems.} h6 {This doesn't seem to do anything except weaken his kingside pawn structure.} 12. Qb3 {? Allows him to chase my queen with tempo.} Be6 13. Qc2 Nbd5 {I still wasn't extremely worried, but I felt black was a little better.} 14. Nxd5 Bxd5 {And his rook is on a very nice file.} 15. Rfe1 {So of course I challenge it, but better would have been doing something about his bishop attacking my knight.} Bxf3 {!} 16. gxf3 {Now I have doubled pawns and terrible king safety. My only advantage is that I plan to use the g file as an weapon, not that I ever manage to.} Nh5 17. Kh1 {I vacate the g file} Qh4 {Threatens mate, and there isn't really any good way to stop it.} 18. Kg2 {I looked long and hard at different variations, but this seemed best.} Qxh2+ {I did expect that} 19. Kf1 Nf4 {This threatens mate again} 20. Bh7+ {I felt I was in a terrible position, so I did this just as a spite check.} Kh8 21. Bxf4 {I thought this prevented the mate, but I didn't notice that his rook is preventing my king from escaping, although I don't know if there even is a way to stop mate.} Qh1# {And I lose. Not a great game, but I learned a little.}
