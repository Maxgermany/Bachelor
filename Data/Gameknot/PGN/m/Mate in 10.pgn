[Opening "Centre game (C21)"]

1. e4 {Standard} e5 {Standard} 2. d4 {This is known as the Centre game (C21). It was named by some British fellow who was unaware that the proper spelling of the word is actually "center." } exd4 {The black pawn makes the typical response, and blows a raspberry at the British pawn on e4 as he bravely stares into the eyes of the white queen from whom he will soon meet his demise. } 3. Qxd4 {The white queen sees her chance to even up the score and promptly disposes of that black pawn who so rudely dared to invade her territory.} Nf6 {The black horse on b8 wanted to threaten the white queen, but the black horse on g8 was chomping at the bit.  He impatiently decides to bolt out of his paddock. } 4. e5 {The black horse is immediately reprimanded for his impatience.  He is forced to lower his head and trot away, much sadder and wiser.  Perhaps this will teach him a lesson.} Nc6 {As the black horse on f6 was considering what to do, his stable mate boldly charges out to alleviate his friend's embarrassment.  There is nothing better than a good old fashioned game of "chase the queen."} 5. Qe3 {"Oh I just hate this game," says the white queen as she slides away.} Ng4 {The black horse on f6 begins to recover from his embarrassment and playfully joins in the fun. It's always great sport to chase the queen. } 6. Qg3 {"Oh phooey," says the white queen as she begins to realize that her faithful foot soldier on e5 is not long for this world.} Ngxe5 {The impatient black horse is now fully recovered from his embarrassment as he emphatically puts his team one point ahead.} 7. Nf3 {The white queen can now rest and recover while the horses on her team have a chance to begin their standard development.  } d6 {The black pawn on d7 sees the danger and decides to lend his protection while also making room for his bishop on some future endeavor. } 8. Nc3 {While the white queen continues to recover from that dreadful game, her breathing pattern begins to normalize. The other horse on her team takes the opportunity, during the lull, to make his standard entrance.} Qe7 {The black queen has an idea. Although she is aware that moving this early in a game often puts herself in peril, she just can't contain her urge. } 9. Nd5 {The white horse sees his opportunity to punish the black queen for making a move.  He says, "Let me give you a taste of your own medicine.  Chase the queen indeed.  Two can play at that game."} Nxf3+ {The impatient black horse is fully aware that his queen is in jeopardy, but he completely ignores the threat! He desperately wants to show his team mates that he is worthy of respect. "They will never call me names again," he thinks to himself.} 10. Kd1 {In order to get his king out of check, the white horse would love to simply take the black queen, but alas that will not remove the check.  Then the white queen thinks, "Oh, I can just take that black horse," but then she realizes that will not remove the check either.  As the smoke clears, the white team slowly begins to realize that there is only one legal move on the entire board.  The white king is forced to take a side step as he sadly proclaims, "I'll never be able to castle now." The bishop beside him says, "That is the very least of your problems, sire."} Qe1# {Checkmate}
