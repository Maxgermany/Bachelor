[Opening "Latvian counter-gambit (C40)"]

1. e4 {Hey all; I've got a mini from awhile ago for you to enjoy over lunch. We begin with that opening that so frequently produces miniatures--the Latvian Gambit. } e5 2. Nf3 f5 {For lots more discussion of this opening, check out some of my other annotations. I'm not going to go in-depth here.} 3. exf5 {Also possible: 3.d4, 3.Nxe5, or 3.Bc4. } e4 4. Ne5 Nf6 {4...d6 is also seen on occasion, but I think the text is much better, forcing White to really commit if he wants the check on h5. } 5. Be2 {White does want the check on h5! This is standard. } Be7 {This move grants the BK a critical escape square. Others are possible but I think this has the best chances for Black. } 6. Bh5+ Kf8 {Of course 6...g6 falls flat, dropping an extra pawn for no benefit. The text invites White to win an exchange with the fork on f7, at the cost of development and tempo. } 7. d4 {?! White declines the gain of material--wisely, in my opinion--and offers an intriguing counter-gambit instead. I have not encountered this move here before--d2-d4 is a staple in many lines of this opening, but here it is a rather risky proposition. } exd3 e.p. {Black gets to eliminate his weak pawn with benefits. It's not clear whether White's response should be Nxd3 or cxd3. The latter gives a better hold on the center, but the former avoids weakening his pawn structure. } 8. Qxd3 {?? This is a simple oversight that hangs a piece, though as we'll see, it's not trivial for Black to hold on to the advantage. } Nxh5 9. Qd5 {White threatens instant death at f7. } Qe8 {Black plays his only possible defense. } 10. g4 {This is an interesting push--White commits to an all-out assault against the Black kingside, but I think he'd have been better suited by developing or perhaps castling. } Nf6 {Black gains the initiative. } 11. Qc4 {White maintains the attack on f7 and threatens the undefended c-pawn. } d5 {!? 11...d6 is certainly safer, or else 11...Nc6, but the text keeps the initiative in Black's control and avoids blocking any diagonals for his Bishops and Queen. } 12. Qxc7 {White takes the free pawn; I don't think there's anything better. } Nc6 {Black continues development while badly limiting the scope of the WQ. ...Bd8 is now a significant threat. } 13. O-O {White gets his King off the open e-file, though the kingside isn't much safer. His attack has fizzled out and soon White will find himself on the defensive. } Nxe5 {Black begins the real assault before White has time to rally more pieces. } 14. Qxe5 Nxg4 {Removing the best defender of f5, with tempo. } 15. Qxd5 Qh5 {My, how the tables have turned! Now Black will win the f5 pawn while White has to defend against a mating threat. Black has three developed pieces--four counting his LSB--whereas White has only his Queen and DSB. That spells trouble. } 16. Qh1 {?? White's situation was bad, but now, instantly, it has become hopeless. Even 16.Qg2 was better than this; now he's essentially undeveloped his entire army. Better by a wide margin was 16.Bf4, defending the h-pawn and controlling the b8-h2 diagonal (with the option of playing Bg3 later). } Bd6 {Several other moves had to be considered here, but the final deciding factor had to be control of this diagonal. Now White has lost his chance to play Bf4, and his King is still in imminent danger (...Bxh2+ Kg2 Bxf5 etc). } 17. f4 {Probably the best way to hold on, but now the a7-g1 diagonal is open. } Bxf5 {Black prepares to jump to both the diagonals aiming at the WK. What's worse; with the Queen stuck in the corner, If the WK ever ends up on g2, Black can skewer the royal couple with ...Be4+. } 18. h4 {It doesn't matter at this point, but this is simply not good enough. The best White could do was probably 18.Nc3 (protecting e4), and then praying that Black show mercy. } Bc5+ {0-1. White's only recourse is 19.Rf2, but after 19...Bxf2+ 20.Kf1 Re8, it's all over anyway. Thanks to normans for a very fun game! Comments are appreciated; I hope you enjoyed reading! }
