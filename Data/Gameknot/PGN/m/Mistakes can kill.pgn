[Opening "Scotch (C45), Ghulam Kassim variation"]

1. e4 {Possibly the most aggressive first move.} e5 {I do not like the Sicilian as White or Black and so chose to play the Open Game.} 2. Nf3 {Simple, it attacks the e-pawn and gets things going.} Nc6 {Defends the e-pawn, a normal move.} 3. d4 {This is the Scotch Game, which will clear out the center quickly.} exd4 {Basically forced.} 4. Nxd4 {This move logically follows.} Nxd4 {As does this; there's no reason to let the knight go.} 5. Qxd4 {And now White has the center of the board under control.} Qe7 {Black looks to be trying to trade queens soon.} 6. e5 {Meant to keep the pressure on.} Qb4+ {Designed to force a queen trade.} 7. c3 {And it will be on White's terms.} Qxd4 {No choice now.} 8. cxd4 {Of course, the only move.  Though White has the two pawns advanced, note how nothing else is going on for either player.} d6 {Trying to get White's pawns out of the middle of the board.} 9. exd6 {White is happy to oblige, given that the pawn would be lost anyway.} Bxd6 {A good move to get a piece developed.} 10. Bb5+ {Rather weak, but it is a development and a check.} c6 {Deftly blocked by the pawn.} 11. Bc4 {A simple retreat that continues to put pressure on Black.} Be6 {Trying to trade bishops.  What is Black getting at with all the trades?} 12. b3 {Once again, on White's terms.} Bxc4 {Black follows through.} 13. bxc4 {And now it is Black who looks to have a slight advantage, given the weakish hanging pawns in the middle of the board.} O-O-O {Gets the king out of the middle and the rook is now involved.} 14. O-O {Symmetrical and does the same thing that Black's move did.} Nf6 {Here the knight is involved and an avenue opens to get the rook out of the back row.} 15. Nc3 {White is now basically mirroring Black's moves.} c5 {Another trade, this one will open up the d-file, which is conveniently controlled by Black's rook.} 16. dxc5 {The first mistake, though a minor one.  16.d5 would have been better.} Bxc5 {So Black has the d-file.} 17. Nb5 {Attempting an inroads into Black's king position.} Kb8 {The king is retreating a bit and getting out of harm's way for the time being.} 18. Be3 {Now White is proposing the trade.} Bxe3 {Black is happy to do it, as it will weaken the king's defense.} 19. fxe3 {No alternative.} a6 {Attacking the temporarily-forgotten knight.} 20. Nd4 {A retreat that keeps the knight involved.} Rhf8 {Done, I suppose, to protect the f-file, though moving to e8 would have worked.} 21. c5 {More attacks.} Ng4 {Maneuvering to attack the e-pawn and pressure the rook.} 22. Rf4 {Protecting the knight, although Nc2 would have helped.} Nxe3 {Ignoring the White knight for the time being, Black takes the pawn.} 23. c6 {Still pressuring.} Rxd4 {Black is trying for 24. Rxd4 Nc2, or some other series of moves.  At any rate, White can't afford to take the rook.} 24. cxb7 {A terrible move.  It doesn't attack the king, and evidently White has forgotten that the rook on f4 is undefended.} Rxf4 {Black hasn't.} 25. Rb1 {White, left without too many moves, has to protect the pawn.} Rf1+ {Black has pieces to burn and wants White's last piece off the board.} 26. Rxf1 {Only legal move.} Nxf1 {And this finishes White.} 27. Kxf1 {Only smart move.} Kxb7 {And here White resigned. Yay.}
