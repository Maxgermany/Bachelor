1. e4 {for the moment i didnt found better response than 1. ... - g6 2. ...- Bg7 So let's try it again whith this good challenger !} g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. e5 {this is one of the good white strategy : occuppy the field empty space to suffocate me. this is good and now i have a problem with a useless g knight. But are the white abble to maintain this advanced position. This is what i like with moderne defense : the action starts very quickly !} d6 {let's break those 2 lonely pawns } 4. f4 {this give some fragility in kingside, I have to turn it in my advantage} dxe5 5. fxe5 {oh, what a nice kingside free space !} c5 {i still can play c5 to attack his pawns, carefully whith my queen side...} 6. c3 {the position of white will not be maintained long} cxd4 7. cxd4 {Now i have some first trpp to play :  7. cxd4 - Bf5  8. ... - Bxb1  9. Rxb1 - Qa5+ !  10. ... - Qxa2 i learn it whith a norvegian blitz challenger} Bf5 8. Nf3 Bxb1 9. Rxb1 Qa5+ {i like it very much, few people anticipate it} 10. Bd2 Qxa2 11. Bb5+ {now white will try to trap my queen, i have to be very carefull} Nc6 12. Bc3 {i didnt understand this move, somebody help ?} Qd5 {so i have move my queen on d5 ignoring what was the white plan, this was very dangerous} 13. Qe2 {nothing especial coming, ouf !} e6 {preparing castle } 14. O-O {i have one tempo to castle, good for me.At this moment i think that my game has the advantage, isn't it ?} Nge7 15. Ng5 {normal way to attack the black castle i have some time before white put there queen on the h colon. And my e knight will go to f5, it will have to help :)} O-O 16. Bc4 {ok, this is not so dangerous. It will give a tempo to treat the g5 white knight and relocate the queen to the king side. There nothing to  do now on the queen side.} Qd8 17. Qg4 Nf5 {now it has become difficult for white to put there queen on h colon, hi hi hi } 18. Rbd1 {preparing an central pawn push ! But there had ignored the knight fork e3 ...} Ne3 19. Qh3 {treatening mate on h7, good but not enought and this time i'm lucky because i could not calculate it before (blitz game ...)} Qxg5 {so this is the answer ! i win this bloody knight, an i cancel the treat on h7, AND : it is not finished, i still do a fork on the2 rooks !!! yes yes yes !} 20. Bd2 {ok ok, this is a very good answer. So i dont have the choice, i will lose my knight anyway. In this case, better lose it in the best way. So i choose to take g2 whith my queen, then we exchange the queen, i lose my knight, BUT : the white castle is down i and win a paw.} Qxg2+ 21. Qxg2 Nxg2 22. Kxg2 {here we are. Now i stil can take the d4 pawn, finishing to breag the white central pawn position, and whith a knight in the center it could be very dansgerous for white ...} Nxd4 23. Bc3 Nf5 {preparing fork in e3 ...AGAIN !!! ha ha ha (yes i'm happy, this is the pleasure playing chess !)} 24. Rd7 {ok, this is not immediately dangerous, i only regret that my fork will be less punchy ...} Ne3+ {less punchy but eENOUGHT to make my challenger resign. That's all folks !}
