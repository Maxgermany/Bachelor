1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {This time, the Petrosian Defense.  Now, if she played 2...Nc6, then I would play the Ruy Lopez with 3.Bb5  The idea, as I know from experience is that Sue would like to exchange the e pawn.} 3. Nc3 {Of course, I won't allow it because I had a bad experience when Mr. Arboite, who was at the time, in Jack's chess club, but as an assisstant coach.  Well, when he took like that, and I took back, I found myself at a disadvantage.} Nc6 {Not surprised.  In fact, this is the Four Knights Defense.} 4. Bb5 {But, now, I play it like a Ruy Lopez.  Of course, the idea is castling.} Bb4 5. O-O {It is wise to castle early and often.  But, was this the best move?  I don't think so because she could've grabbed my N, and if I were to take back, I'd be left with doubled pawns.  Instead, I believe that best was 5.a3  Sure, it's against guidelines, but nowadays, when faced with this, I'd deviate so that once the opponent runs back, I don't have to worry about doubled pawns.  Since this is not an endgame, and noone has won anything, yet, doubled pawns could be problematic, this time around.  I go by the idea of pawn structures, as I learned and told you about, and if I have it so early, otherwise, and black could avoid, Sue would have a healthier pawn structure, already giving her an advantage.} O-O {However, she castles, which is also good.} 6. d4 {I very much considered 6.a6  But, I decided to give Sue a quiz.  The idea being of course, exchange.  Can she, however, find the right move?} d6 {I was thinking along the lines of 6...exd4 and then would come 7.Nxd4, Nxd4 8.Qxd4, and everything is even.  However, this move is just as good because the e pawn is still protected, so black found the right response, nonetheless.  I am already very impressed with her, and I'm usually not impressed so early.  In fact, I became impresses, as early as, her last move.} 7. Qd3 {?! So, now I put pressure on the d file.  Sometimes, I feel it's ok to deviate from guidelines, a little, as I have seen with GM's.  But, I'm giving as an inaccuracy.  Once I deviated about bringing the Q out too early once development was complete and lost pretty quickly.  Instead, better was 7.Bg3 and now that N is pinned.  Then, she might play 7...h6, and I can then keep the pin with 8.Bh4, and no good after would be 8...g5  Sure, I'd be indirectly forced to play 9.Bg3 to avoid the loss of a piece, but her K winds up exposed.  After reading comments from C++, I intially thought that was no big deal, but I lost a game against Jack by doing something like that and leaving the K in a bad spot.  In it, he said that ...h6 was allright, but ...g5 was not playable for that reason.  Although I played right after that, it was too late since the Q was able to come in and cause damage.} Bg4 {Want's but similarly to 4.Bb5, it's not pinned, so I don't have to react to this attack because nothing is threatened.} 8. Bg5 {But, now I played what I mentioned, with the pin.} a6 {?! Sue, however, has an attack in mind.  But, this is her first inaccuracy.  By playing this, I take, and in order to avoid the loss of a piece, she has to mess up her pawn structures, as I'll explain.  Bear in mind that a player will benefit from a healthier pawn structure, as I've learned from GM Susan Polgar.} 9. Bxc6 Qe7 {?? This, however, is her first blunder.  9...bxc6 was indirectly forced, as that would've compensated and prevented from taking on b7.  Nontheless, her position would be compromised for the reason outlined earlier.  But, it's better then the move played, as this loses a piece and a pawn.} 10. Bxb7 Rab8 {? It's very understandable why Sue moved here.  But, the problem is that it loses, yet, another pawn.  Best was 10...Ra7, and not only is the pawn protected, but my B is attacked.  So, she does get tempo, in return.} 11. Bxa6 Rba8 {?! Probably trying to get tempo.  I think the idea was to get tempo, but there is an overload which black did not see.  That is, being the Q, as that adds a defender to a6, so that I don't have to pull back.} 12. Qb5 {Therefore, studying and applying those variations from a private annotation, which I saw in a GM game, so I reattack.  Yes, I have studied others, but where a piece is actually attacked because they don't have an extra defender, so the opponent, does retreat, but in a way that reattacks.  It's very common in GM games, as I studied in a game from Susan Polgar which I, recently, annotated, as well.} Bxc3 {?! Inaccruacy.  Sure, I wind up with doubled pawns.  But, in this position, that's no big deal as I'm also ahead a piece and two pawns.  The problem here is that by taking, she's liquidating pieces when behind.  So later on, that will increase my advantage.} 13. bxc3 Rab8 {Not at all surprised with this move.} 14. Qd3 {In addition to protection, the other idea is adding the overload to d4, as I now have another defender.} Qe6 {?! Same idea.  It's with the overload.  But, this is an inaccuracy because of my next move.} 15. d5 {And, yes, without overdoing this time around, I applied the same variations that I saw in that private annotation which was, at the time, my favorite.  Otherwise, I would've taken on e5, forcing a pawn exchange.  But, a lot of GM's instead of exchanging the way I mentioned play something like this.  So, they advance the pawn further up and attack the opponents piece.  At first, I wasn't sure why, but now it makes sense.  The plan, and as for forcing moves which I recently learned, is the gain of tempo.} Qd7 {?! Best was 15...Qe7, and now if 16.Bxf6, she can retake with 16...Qxf6 strengthening her position a little as the Q is stronger, as I also learned in that annotation, but much earlier.  But, with this move, I know destroy her pawn structure around the K, and it becomes exposed.  Not a super big deal since, sometimes, you can play with an exposed K, as I recently learned.  Plus, damalfi would say that I'm focusing too much on general's if I called this a blunder just with an exposed since a similar position happened in a different annotation where I was over critical.  But, with that, the bigger picture is that it still enables me to liquidate pieces while ahead.} 16. Bxf6 Qa4 {? Now, it's safe to call this a mistake.  I understand the logic as I used to make this error a lot back when I was, about, her rating.  It was for attacking something and gaining tempo.  This works at GM level, but even with someone at about my rating, it's generally not a good idea to do that.  Best was 16...gxf6 and now Sue would not have lost an extra pawn, yet.  But, with this move, however, black must lose another pawn.} 17. Bxg7 Kxg7 18. Bc4 {To put pressure on the a2-g8 square with the idea that my B is covering, I believe, 9 squares.  The idea, as easy19 puts it which is also basic is, how many squares does your B cover?  It's also an important concept because I recently discovered that the more squares your B covers, the more your advantages increase.} Kh8 {To protect her K, which I agree is very important.} 19. Rab1 {Now, I'm going for an exchange.  That's because the idea is that you liquidate pieces when ahead.} Rba8 {! Good choice.  Black sees this, and prevents me from doing that.  And, despite the disadvantages or blunders, I'm still very impressed with how she's playing, this time around.  This is very unusual as after the student has a disadvantage, it's hard to make me impressed, but Sue is a different story, however, as she's still playing, in my opinion, very well.} 20. Rb4 {Typical of what you see from GM's, one way of doing so, is attacking the opponents Q.  It's not, however, for the thrill of it, but when you do and see that's a difficult situation for the opponent, that's when you go for it.  And, my idea is trying to think like a Grandmaster.  And, as noted, I played through a similar variation.  I also kept in mind that black cannot take on a2, due to my B.} Qd7 21. Nd2 {Well, I was going to move this, now, seeing that I'm not in a pin.  I also learned that if a stronger players N is near his home square, like this, you often increase your advantages.  I know of someone that increased his edge by doing that.  Also, although I didn't expect it so soon, I anticipated that, at some point, black would play ...c6, so this move does overload my B.  Another reason, from what I studied, why stronger players like to bring their N near the homesquare.} c6 {? The reason I didn't anticipate this now, however, is that it is a mistake.  By playing this, white wins a pawn.  I'm not sure what the best move would've been, but as a friend told me, before he left, "Almost any move is better then this."} 22. dxc6 Qxc6 {?? Blunder.  Black had to be aware of this skewer.  Now, I don't just attack, but in order to protect her Q, Sue must lose her R, for a B, in addition to, what she's lost.} 23. Bd5 Qa6 24. Qxa6 Rxa6 25. h3 {Keeping this in mind, and that we're nearing the end game.  I don't just play this for the thrill and giggles of attacking, but my long term goal is activating my K and using it as a weapon.} Bd7 {Most common was 25...Bh5, but there's nothing wrong with this move.} 26. Rfb1 {Meanwhile, I, finally, double up, as noted earlier.} Rg8 {? Probably, to put pressure near the K.  However, she just has a R near that square, so there's no threats.  And, this move is a mistake as it loses another pawn.} 27. Bxf7 Be6 {?? Trying to win my a pawn.  Usually, it's not bad and considering that one would want to gain tempo, it would be very understandable.  But, this is a blunder, as it loses, yet, another piece.} 28. Bxe6 Re8 {Obviously going after my B.} 29. Rb4b8 {?? I was thinking of liquidating, as I'm ahead.  But, this is a blunder as she should've, however, compensated and grabbed my B.  Better was 29.Bd7 adding pressure to the eighth rank.} Rxb8 {?? But black overlooked that and played, what I noted.  As a result, it becomes liquidation, as opposed to, an exchange.} 30. Rxb8+ {At this point, while not right away, I realize that mate becomes invitable sooner or later.  I just have to find a way to do this.  The idea is that, when you have an advantage, try to increase it.} Kg7 31. Rb7+ {So, the plan starts here.  And, now, just using memory techniques from chess puzzles, as it was before those end game quizzes, it's about confining the K, until I have a mate.  While not here, at the time, I didn't realize how centralization or opposition played a role.  But, as I recently learned, don't get too stuck on it, as that's often more then you need to force a win.} Kh6 32. Bf5 {But, I have taken quizzes from GM Judit Polgar and applied it.  One thing to find mate, is even if you can't check on one move, when you have a B, place in a spot where the K cannot escape.  By doing so, there will be no way out.} Rxa2 {?? The idea was getting a pawn.  But, "To take is a mistake."  By doing this, I check in the place where I want to, and it winds up being something very similar to the quiz, that I mentioned a move earlier.  That's because of my next move.  With that being said, best was 32...Kg5} 33. Rxh7+ Kg5 {Forced.} 34. h4+ {As they say, "Now the fun begins."} Kf6 {! Best.  The only other option was 34...Kf4??, but after that, I would immediately mate 35.g3#  With that being said, this prolongs the game by a move.} 35. g4 {Having said what I noted earlier, I come out with a different way to mate.  In fact, no matter what she does, I'm still going to mate with the same next move.   } Rxc2 36. g5# {Overall, black extremely well.  I would say, like a 1000 rated player.  But, @knightrider62: The lesson to be learned is, "Don't give things away".  There were mistakes that lost material, and by doing so, it enabled me to force a win.  So, like I said in a previous annotation, always judge carefully, and don't leave your pieces attacked.  If those mistakes weren't made, I think the game would've, sooner or later, ended in a draw.}
