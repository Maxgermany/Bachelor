1. d4 f5 {One of my favorite openings, the Dutch Defense is. Although I don't think I'll ever do it again in a short game. It requires too much thought, and little for my opponent.} 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 {Queen's Gambit formation...} e6 4. Nc3 d5 5. cxd5 {I have never experienced somebody taking before....} Nxd5 6. g3 Nc6 7. Bg2 Bb4 8. Bd2 O-O 9. O-O {I felt like I could have done something here, so I wasted six minutes thinking about it. Sadly, I just settled for trading pieces.} Bxc3 10. Bxc3 Nxc3 11. bxc3 h6 {A waiting move. I didn't quite know exactly what to do at this moment. It does however, prevent 12 Ng5?} 12. Re1 {Preparing for 13 e4} a6 {Another waiting move. I still did not know what I wished to do. All I knew was that when White presses e4 I would also press f4.} 13. Nd2 {Opening up the threat of the bishop.} Bd7 {? Causes all sorts of problems. I probably should have moved 13...Ne7} 14. Qc2 {? I don't see what this accomplishes at all....} b5 {? With the idea of stopping 15 Nd4 I knew the pin on the knight was bad so I planned to break it immediately. Still, it should have been obvious to me that this allowed White's knight in with Nb3 then Nc5.} 15. Nb3 Ra7 {This rook literally does nothing for the rest of the game. I moved it with the idea of protecting the a pawn. Later, I repeatedly wished that I had moved it elsewhere.} 16. e4 f4 17. e5 {? d5 would have been much much better. White wants to open the game up, and Black is in no position to stop him. From there the game would have been pretty easily won.} Qg5 18. Nc5 {! Threatens a fork if 18...Be8 and forces Black into a very unnatural move...} Nb8 19. Be4 {? Helping Blacks cause. Possibly thinking Bh7+? That does absolutely nothing at all.} f3 {Finally the pawn is where it wants to be to strongly threaten a mate. Can Black protect it?} 20. Qd3 Qg4 21. Re3 Bc6 {! Forcing a trade that puts Black's knight into the game. Now the Black's pawn is almost impossible to take.} 22. Bxc6 Nxc6 23. h4 {? Doesn't really solve any problems. Makes mating easier in fact. Possibly a long king retreat would have been preferable? 23 Kf1 Qh3+ 24 Ke1 Qxh2 25 Qf1} Ne7 {From there I knew that all I had to do was move my knight over, and the mate would be mine.} 24. Kh2 {? Stopping 24 Qh3? Another that just makes mating a lot easier. The sad thing is that my opponent had plenty of time. About ten minutes while I had only five.} Ng6 {Threatening 25...Nxh4. } 25. Qe4 {! I believe the best move White had. Black cannot afford a queen trade....} Nf4 {!! If 26 xf4 then Qg2++ or if 26 Qxf4 Rxf4. Giving Black six points.} 26. Qxf3 {For a second I thought I had made a mistake. I queen could take the pawn.} Qh3+ 27. Kg1 Nd5 {! Threatening the queen and rook at the same time, Black is most definitely in a winning situation.} 28. Qh5 {? A bad move. 28 Qe2 or Qe4 would have kept this a one point game. Instead it allows Black to screw White over....} Nxe3 29. fxe3 Qxg3+ 30. Kh1 Rf2 {Ending the game. White only had a few moves to prevent the inevitable.} 31. Qe8+ Kh7 32. Qg6+ Qxg6 {Simpler would have been 32...Kxg6 33 Rg1 Rh2++. I didn't realize that after the game, believing I would lose my queen from the pin.} 33. Rg1 Qc2 {"Checkm-oh crap!" I almost moved queen to e4. Just before I let go I realized the near error.} 34. Rg3 Rh2+ 35. Kg1 Qf2# {Many mistakes were made in this game. Probably what saved my bad opening was the fact that my opponent made so many pointless moves. I'm proud of my nice knight combo at the end that led to my opponents downfall. Scored 3.5 in the tournament. Only losing to a 1900 and drawing to a 1500. Stanwood came in eighth to take a trophy, which has never happened in our school history.}
