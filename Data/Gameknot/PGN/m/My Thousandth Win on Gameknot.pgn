1. e4 {I'm annotating this game because of statistical felicity rather than technical merit, though there is a lesson for us all at the end.  id=aramis is one of my buddies and my record against him now stands at P16 W11 L5 since I lost the return game in this League D2 match.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 {A relatively uncommon but perfectly OK response to the Najdorf.} e5 {6...e6 would have transposed into the Scheveningen.  I played 6...e5 on principle.  Looking it up in Nunn and Gallagher's 'The Complete Najdorf: Modern Lines', I find that this is the main line response.} 7. Nf3 {But this is described as a sideline, compared with 7. Nb3.} Be6 {Black immediately covers the hole at d5.} 8. O-O {?! Nunn gives 8. Ng5 Qc7 9. Nxe6 fxe6 10. 0-0 Be7 11. f4 exf4 12. Bxf4 giving a slight edge for White} Be7 {Now we're out of Nunn's book, though playing moves that are generally typical of such an opening.} 9. Be3 {White takes aim at b6, an approach that has caused me problems in the past.} O-O 10. Na4 {Here it comes ...} Nbd7 11. Ng5 {White seizes the opportunity to secure the advantage of the two bishops.  Black cannot prevent it.} b5 12. Nxe6 fxe6 {The central doubled pawns aren't too disastrous because the mobile d-pawn should enable Black to sort them out and the f-file is now half-open in his favour. } 13. Nc3 Nb6 {Black prepares either to occupy c4 or advance the d-pawn} 14. a4 {White responds by threatening to win a pawn on b5} d5 {Black, probably wrongly, decides that the most urgent task is to sort out his central pawns and threaten a fork from d4.  This loses material rather than gains it.} 15. Bxb6 Qxb6 {Now both d5 and b5 are targeted by overwhelming odds.} 16. axb5 a5 17. exd5 exd5 18. Nxd5 Nxd5 19. Qxd5+ {Now White is 2 pawns up and his Q is dominating the board.} Kh8 20. Qxe5 {Make that 3 pawns!} Rae8 21. Qh5 Bc5 {At last some sort of counter-play} 22. Bf3 {White gives up the b-pawn to protect f2.} Qxb5 {Now I had visions of Bxf2+ with a discovered attack on White's Q but couldn't find a way to force White to undefend his Q.} 23. b3 g6 24. Qg4 Re7 {So I doubled rooks instead.} 25. Rfe1 Rfe8 26. Rxe7 Rxe7 27. h3 Qb4 {? Not usually wise to swap off when material down ...} 28. Qxb4 Bxb4 29. Kf1 {White should be able to win easily from here.  Look at that lovely passed c-pawn!} Bc3 {Black blocks the c-pawn and threatens the R} 30. Rd1 Kg7 {So that White can't activate his rook with a back-row check.} 31. Rd3 {?? Loses in one.  White momentarily takes his eye off the ball and the danger of a back-row mate.} Re1# {A lucky mate, so typical of so many of my wins on Gameknot!}
