1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {my standard play, against d6: the threat is dxe5, dxe5, Qxd8+, and losing the right to castle...} Bg4 4. h3 {demanding a declaration straightaway...} Bh5 5. g4 Bg6 6. Bc4 {development...} Nf6 7. dxe5 {dxe5 is hardly an option: see above comments...} Nxe4 8. O-O Nc6 9. c3 {avoiding Nb4/Nd4...} Be7 10. Bf4 {development...} O-O 11. Nbd2 {the object is clear: trading Ne4...} Qe8 {??? you tell me...} 12. Nxe4 Bxe4 13. Nd4 {same play: trade the Knights...} Bh4 14. f3 {a convenient tempo: and probably the winning move...} Bg6 15. exd6 {winning a pawn: Qe8 is not in trouble yet, due to Bh4...} Qd8 {??? this is not helpful either: due to Bf4...} 16. Nxc6 bxc6 17. dxc7 Qc8 18. Qd6 {time to bring in the Queen: Rd8 is no threat...} Qb7 19. b3 {we look after the little ones...} Rac8 20. Kg2 {not doing much: maybe preparing trading Bishops, with Bg3...} Rxc7 {Black cracks under pressure: of course, this is losing...} 21. Qxc7 {probably the first moment, Black realizes there is a White Bishop at f4...} Qa6 {??? Black resigning?} 22. Bxa6 {Black resigned...}
