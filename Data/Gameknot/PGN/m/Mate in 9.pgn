1. Nf3 {I start the game using the Reti opening.  This is my favorite opening du jour when I am playing white.  I start with Reti, and then I try to parlay it into the Queens Gambit.  This is something that I have been doing for the last year or so.  I have pretty good success with it, and it is a lot of fun.} d5 {Black marches out the Queen Pawn.  This is a pretty standard response to Reti.  Of course it would not be a good idea to march out the King Pawn because my faithful steed would eat him for lunch.} 2. d4 {I know that the standard Reti opening says that white should go c4 here, but I don't like doing that. I always like to immediately block an opponents pawn on the 5th rank.  If I don't block, then there is always a chance that he might be able to push it to the 4th rank in the future and I hate being boxed it.  I don't like to have my mobility hindered.  } f5 {This is unusual and perhaps this is the beginning of the downfall for black but I don't see it as a big mistake.  It is just unorthodox.  I am not sure what he is trying to do.  Perhaps some sort of Kings Gambit.  In my opinion moving the f pawn is not a good idea because you are loosing some protection for your King.} 3. c4 {Now I parlay into the Queens Gambit which is really fun for me.  As I said before, I have been doing this for about a year now and I really like it.  This does a lot of good things for white.  It opens up a path for the Queen to make a check.  It acts as a lure to pull the black pawn out of the center.  If he accepts the Gambit then I check with the Queen and immediately get back my lost Pawn.  One thing I don't like is the fact that the black Pawn on f remains unblocked. Maybe this is just my own idiosyncrasy.} dxc4 {Black accepts the Gambit.  I am not smart enough to know if this is a good idea or not.  White can easily get the pawn back, but then black can start attacking the Queen.  I don't think this is a blunder for black, but maybe a contributing factor to the downfall.} 4. Qa4+ {This is my standard response when black accepts the Gambit.  I check the King and also put the black Pawn in jeopardy. It is a fun trick, although I know that it can be bad to bring out the Queen this early.  It give black the opportunity to start taking pot shots at her.  It can easily lead to a game of "chase the queen."} Bd7 {This is one of the standard responses for black.  He could have also blocked with the Knight.  Either way works fine.  Neither way prevents me from taking the Pawn back.} 5. Qxc4 {I now have my Pawn back and the score is back to even.  My Queen is hanging out there and very vulnerable to attack.} e6 {This looks like a pretty good idea for black.  He opens up a path for both his Queen and his Bishop.  He also gives protection to that f pawn which was hanging out there by its lonesome.  Notice that white has both the d and e pawns in tact and black has lost his d pawn. According to the experts this is a really good thing for white, although I am not smart enough at this point in my chess career to understand why.} 6. d5 {I push my d pawn here.  This prevents the black Knight from coming out, but of course, black will consider swapping pawns with me.  If black does swap pawns, then that black f pawn will be hanging out by its lonesome again.  This is a very aggressive move for white, and if I was in a different mood I might not have done it.  It is likely that I will lose my d pawn which the experts say is a no no.  I guess I was in an "easy come easy go" type of mood.  Let's roll the dice.  You only live once.} exd5 {So black takes my d pawn.  That is what I would have done also.  I don't see any blunder here.  Of course white will take the pawn back on the next move.} 7. Qxd5 {As expected, white takes the pawn back and the score is even.  The white Queen is very vulnerable to attack although she can easily tuck her tail and zip home for lunch if black threatens her.  Also the white King is vulnerable to check but it can be easily blocked.  The black f pawn is not threatened at this point because it is protected by the black Bishop.} Nc6 {OK this looks like a standard good move for black.  He brings out his Knight.  Very ordinary move and it looks like a fine move to me.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  Black is just doing normal development.  He does not threaten my Queen as I was expecting, but this move looks OK to me.} 8. Ne5 {Another aggressive move for white.  I must be in a Monte Carlo type of mood.  Let's roll the dice.  This Knight is not protecting any pawns so lets put him into action.  The experts would say that white should develop more pieces here: bring out the other white Knight or the bishop, or push the e pawn.  But I am in a strange mood today.} Nge7 {Black decides to threaton the Queen.  Looks like a good idea.  Let's get that Queen out of here.  Makes sense.  And while doing that black also adds protection to the f pawn.  Good idea in general. But alas this is a huge mistake.  Black did not notice the checkmate.  He should have swapped Knights with me, although that would have left him in check but it could have been easily blocked.} 9. Qf7# {Checkmate in 9 moves.  I am pretty proud of this, but lets talk about what caused the downfall for black.  Moving that f pawn was strange, but I don't think that was the big mistake.  I think the mistake was that black should have started attacking the white Queen as soon as possible.  Black kept ignoring the Queen and she ultimately had her way with him.  Of course black simply did not see the checkmate or he could have stopped it.  That was a giant blunder for sure.  But black should have chased her away long before she got to that position.}
