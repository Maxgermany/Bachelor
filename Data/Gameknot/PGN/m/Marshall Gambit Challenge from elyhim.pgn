1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. c3 {Ruy Lopez common line} d5 {Marshall attack (thematic game).} 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Rxe5 c6 {Modern variation, common line} 12. d4 a5 {Not the common line any longer.} 13. Qf3 {Usual move in a Marshall attack.} Bd6 {Attacking the rook} 14. Re1 {classical move } Re8 {To contest the open file} 15. Be3 {Bocking the e file} Be6 {developping and preparing an attack on the queen side} 16. Nd2 {Developping and joining the rooks} a4 {White will have to face a strong queenside attack, very uncommon in the Marshall attack (black usually attak the king side by playin Qh4. so that I make my plan : attacking on the kingside.} 17. Bc2 {Now everybody in white's uniform is aiming at the black king.} a3 {Black's pawn advance is dangerous. White's attack on the king had better be strong and quick} 18. b3 {First, slowdown black on the queenside} Nxc3 {"A pawn is a pawn" like my mighty opponent says but this attack doesn't seem too serious, material is now equal and the knight has little immediate menace available (at least, it seemed so).} 19. Qh5 {So that white launches the counterattack. I thought that against such a powerfull opponent, I should take the initiative. If I let Elohim play his game, I can, at best oppose a long resistance but I'm doomed. So that Dame Guenièvre is paying a little visit, knocking at the black king's castle} g6 {Only move, foreigners are not welcomed under the castle walls} 20. Qh6 {Now, white's idea was to carry on with DSB and knight on f3.} Bf8 {Alas ! I had overlooked this simple move.} 21. Qf4 {Fearing the black archery, Dame Guenièvre has to retreat in her domain, not even choosing the square. if 21. Qg5 Qxg5 22. Bxg5 Bg4 with menace on e2 from both knight and bishop} Nd5 {The evil black knight harasses the poor Dame Guenièvre} 22. Qf3 {... Who has only one proper place to go.} Bb4 {Now black controls about two third of the board, are better on the center which is still contested by white and has a strong and dangerous soldier on a3, in ambush for the endgame.} 23. Be4 {I thought I had now to block black on the queenside, menacing c6} Nxe3 {The d knight has loss his protection against black's DSB menace. Things begin to look really bad for white.} 24. Qxe3 {Only way to carry on Protecting the faithfull Lancelot, Dame Guenièvre's presence is giving him courage in the battle.} Bd5 {Carrying on the pressing} 25. f3 {Weakening the white king but I couldn't find any better move.} f5 {Pressing white's central bishop. Black has to be quite sure of himself, probably seeing a precise tactic because this move seriously weakens the black king.} 26. Bxd5+ {One's more, I couldn't find any better move. Atleast, I preserve the material equality} Qxd5 27. Qd3 {Only move to save the queen and protect Lancelot and d4, white's isolated pawn. Dame Guenièvre, in the middle of the battlefield, rally all her faithfull servants} c5 {Attacking the weak and essential d4 pawn.} 28. Rac1 {To escape the mortal fork attack Qxd4+ and the a rook meets its doom. Anyway, the brave d4 soldier is unproctable and ready to lay down his life for his queen.} Qxd4+ {Aargh !} 29. Qxd4 {Nothing else to do} cxd4 {Black has now a passed pawn. I could have submited here but I thought there could be more to learn, studying Elyhim's tactic.} 30. Rxe8+ {Exchanges are not good for white but that was the only way to avoid 30. Nd2 or 30. Nxe1 which would have been even worse !} Rxe8 {The second time in this game that black has a forced move to play (white had at least six).} 31. Nf1 {Almost forced (31. Nb1 would have let the king protected only by the pawn and Lancelot would have been blocked in the corner)} d3 {Only two more steps } 32. Rd1 {Blocking the d pawn and setting the rook on a dark square} Bc5+ {Unavoidable} 33. Kh1 {Forced move} Re2 {!} 34. Rxd3 {What else ?} Re1 {Lancelot is still guarding the castle gate but the brave knight is doomed} 35. h3 {providing an escape to the king} Rxf1+ {Now black has material advantage.} 36. Kh2 Rf2 {To menace the a2 pawn.} 37. Rd5 {... which white cannot defend. The only way is a stronger menace} Bb6 {Black has plenty of place to escape.} 38. Rxb5 {A pawn is a pawn.} Bc7+ {White has only one move.} 39. Kg1 {If 39. Kh1 Rf1+mate} Rxa2 {A new passed pawn for black} 40. Rb7 {Harassing the bishop} Bg3 {Another forced move for white} 41. Kf1 {To avoid the mate} Rf2+ {... but not the check.} 42. Kg1 {The poor king Arthur is under a close siege in his castle, under the weak protection of his last henchmen.} Rb2 {Preventing 43. Ra7} 43. Kf1 {Arthur goes for a little walk (so long he still can)} a2 44. Ra7 {Only move to delay the mate} Rb1+ {Only one move available for white} 45. Ke2 a1=Q {White submits here. Thank you Elyhim for this lesson. The queenside developpement in the Marshall gambit is uncommon and an interresting alternative to the traditionnal attack (as long as I can judge).}
