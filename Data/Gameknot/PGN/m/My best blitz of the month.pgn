1. f4 {bird opening} e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. d4 c5 4. c3 Nf6 5. e3 {wall stone variation, i'm getting it} Nc6 6. Be2 {defending Nf3, preserving lsb for after and preparing castle kind side ( better than a useless 6. Bb5 a6 7. Bb5xNc6 b7xc6 and even better than 6. Bd3 met by c4)} Be7 7. O-O Qc7 {I did not understood the reason of this move, somebody does ? is not a blunder anyway but in my opinion it loose a tempo} 8. Ne5 {This is one of the interesting move in bird opening, if 8. ... Nc6 x Ne5 9. fxe5, which open the f colon in order threatening directly f7 with the rook. An dif not, the knight in e5 is a very good position} O-O 9. Na3 {pretending go to b5 to attack the queen, but the goal was to move in c2 for bringing the knight to the kind side for after. So if opponent want to prevent B5, it will loose a tempo and let me preparing my troops movements} a6 {He does} 10. Nc2 b6 11. Bd2 {another preparation, in order to go to the king side passing via e1. This is an inconvenient of the bird : the dsb is blocked in queen side, and it take at least 2 tempo to develop it } Bb7 {but opponent seems to let me preparing all I want to do...maybe this was his tactical mistake (?)} 12. Be1 {dsb is ok now} Rfd8 {another move that i dont understand, this rrok was better in f8 defending F7. So now i have a plan : send lsb to h5 : If exchange with f6 knight, then my queen retake and win a good attack position (h5). If not, i can attack directly f7 which is threatened by e5 knight...} 13. Bh5 Nxh5 14. Qxh5 {so after exchange, we can appreciate a advantageous white position. Blacks has his queen side useless, with a lsb blocked and a queen far from battlefield. And i'm still threatening f7.} Bf6 {now black queen is entering in the game protecting f7. Blacks has to defend. it is encouraging for me.} 15. Bh4 {this was not my better move but it will give something interesting after ...} Qe7 16. Ne1 {Ne1?!  i'm sacrificing my dsb, in compensation i will bring my second knight to the fightand this will give a leading advantage} Bxh4 17. Ne1f3 {now black dsb has to retreat and i will advance my f3 knight to g5} Bf6 18. Ng5 {f7 threatened again} h6 {i will win the f7 pawn} 19. Ngxf7 {the plan was qg4 ... kxh6+} Rdc8 20. Qg4 {implementing the plan} Bxe5 21. fxe5 {my rook is there to protect the f7 knight. } Kh7 {OK, so i change my plans : let's attack queen side (rook, bishop, ...) and in thisway i will bring my f1 rook to F7} 22. Nd6 Rcg8 {anticipating Rf7 ?} 23. Rf7 {surely !} Qg5 {offering a queen exchange. NEVER !} 24. Qxe6 Bc8 25. Nxc8 Raxc8 26. Re1 {preferring being safe than taking more risk with directly a Ra1 F1. But this is the idea for after} cxd4 27. exd4 {not a problem } Rge8 {wining d5 pawn} 28. Qxd5 Ne7 29. Qe4+ Ng6 30. Ref1 {here we are, my rook are aligned} Kg8 {At the moment i did not saw the plan ...Kh4 preparing mate in g2} 31. Qd5 {so i go on threatening and searching the wining way : discovered chess wins the queen} Kh8 {of course} 32. Qd7 {This theat was ok BUT the response was better ... Kh4! i should saw it from before} Nh4 {now i have to retreat and defend. } 33. Qd5 Qe3+ 34. Kh1 {not a problem} Red8 35. Qe6 {not a problem : i prepare to go back to the my kind side zone (g4) in order to mate in g7} Qe4 {OK, so i will go to h3 to protect g2 and, for after, to threat the knight. And this last threat will give me the victory (see move 37)} 36. Qh3 Rc6 {black mistake : Rh7 h4 wins the knight} 37. Rf7f4 {So there my opponent resign. }
