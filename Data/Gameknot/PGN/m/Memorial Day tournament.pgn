1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 e6 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. d4 {A little aggressive here, but this wins the centre and also frees up the bishop on c1} cxd4 6. Nxd4 Be7 7. Bd3 {Strengthening the centre, please note not only is white ahead on development, but he is already aiming his pieces toward where black's king will end up next move.} O-O 8. Be3 {This realistically only serves to strengthen the centre and allow the 0-0-0 later.} a6 {preparing the queenside pawn storm and also gives the bishop on c8 a chance to escape being blocked in by the f7 and e6 pawns.} 9. g4 {White is a little reckless here and forgets about the bishop threat after e5, however even after black wins the pawn white gains the g file for his rook which will come to be rather painful in the later stages of the game.} e5 {trying to break up white's strong centre and win the pawn on g4} 10. fxe5 Bxg4 11. Qd2 dxe5 12. Nde2 {the knight has no other good square to go to, f5 is a possibility but this allows the 0-0-0} Nc6 {continues development} 13. O-O-O {making the king safer and also allows the option of bringing the other rook into play} b5 {continues the pawn storm} 14. Rhg1 {bringing the rook onto the open g file, this is the start of white's attack, now the bishop on e3 starts to have some options} Bxe2 15. Qxe2 Nd7 16. Bh6 Bf6 17. Nd5 {if white takes black is almost forced to take with the queen to prevent the king from being opened up entirely} Nd4 {Black decides to bring the other knight in to defend the kingside} 18. Qf2 {white increases the pressure on the f6 bishop} Kh8 {freeing the pawn to defend the bishop} 19. Nxf6 {black must now take with the queen to prevent bxg7+ kg8, bxf6#} Qxf6 20. Qxf6 {}
