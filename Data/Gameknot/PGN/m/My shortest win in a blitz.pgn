1. a4 {Pretty daring, with 1200 ELO against a 1760.} d5 2. d4 {With this, a4 is a loss of tempo. } Bf5 3. a5 {This can prevent my queen to go to b6. } a6 {This will prevent his lsb to go to b5. Both are important spots in the scheme I normally follow. } 4. h3 {Useless.} e6 {Freeing my pieces.} 5. h4 {This is even worse.} Nf6 6. f3 {White definitely is not moving a piece. Now, this makes weak the important square g3. } Qd6 {Don't tell me it's preferable to develop the bishop. } 7. g4 {Oh, my bishop is lost!} Qg3+ 8. Kd2 Bxg4 {My bishop is not lost, because of...} 9. fxg4 {and if white takes it...} Ne4# {That's all. I annotated the game just to remember this mate position, pretty unusual. }
