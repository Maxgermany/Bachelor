1. d4 e6 {I bit offbeat but my idea is to transpose to KID of Benoni lines. } 2. g3 c5 {Taking advantage of the fact that Russ did not develop is g-knight to f3. } 3. Bg2 {!? no real problem with this move but I think Nf3 or dxc5 are more sound. } cxd4 4. e4 {?! not a good move besides losing another centre pawn black will have an easy time developing and gaining control of the centre. } dxe3 e.p. 5. Bxe3 {white looks ok. Especially, when you think that black has not even touched his pieces yet, but thing are about to change. The old master will demonstrate the power of the centre pawns. } Ne7 {There is one problem of developing your bishop to e3 is that it is attackable. } 6. Nh3 {?? *clears his throat* this just looks wrong on all levels. Nf3 is best. } Nf5 {nice outpost for the knight with tempo. This knight will exchange itself on e3 to win a pawn in a few move. very pretty combo you may want to stay tuned. } 7. O-O Nxe3 8. fxe3 Qb6 {there you go. Black has only one piece developed but it is just completely overwhelming white. } 9. Qf3 {Nice move that keeps white in this barely. } f6 {defending the threat. } 10. b3 {?! not necessary as this pawn was in no real danger as capturing it would but the black queen out of play. Better is getting the knight into the game with Nf5-Nd3 } Nc6 {now because white did not play Nf5 black threatens Ne5. } 11. Nd2 Ne5 12. Qe4 Bc5 {I think 12...e5 is also playable but I would to teach by example that when attacking be like a dog with a bone. Pick a weak pawn and hit with everything you got. } 13. Nc4 Nxc4 14. Qxc4 d5 {The e3 pawn finally falls and Russ resigns. I think he learned his lesson, off beat moves(meaning moves to get masters out of book and playing on their own devices) does not work. And giving up centre pawns can cost you a lot. However, credit to Russ as he did have a plan and did try to execute it!  }
