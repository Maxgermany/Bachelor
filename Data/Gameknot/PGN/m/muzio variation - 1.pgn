1. e4 {Kings Gambit, Muzio variation The idea is to gain a lot in development by allowing black to capture a knight for a pawn 1. centre pawn} e5 {usual response} 2. f4 {f pawn attaching black's e pawn, there is no other choice for black but to capture f4} exf4 {as predicted black capture the f4 pawn} 3. Nf3 {taking the knight out, a step to castling king side} g5 {black shores up his f pawn in order to hang on to his pawn advantage} 4. Bc4 {white ignores the threat of g5-g4, attacking white knight and develops the bishop. The idea is to prepare an attack on black's f7 pawn} g4 {black attacks the f3 knight. If the knight moves, the pawn sacrifice would be in vain as black would send its queen to h4 check. Then, white king would have to move out of check. White will allow black to capture the knight} 5. O-O {White castles, allowing black an easy knight, -4 points} gxf3 {black captures white's knight} 6. Qxf3 {white capture black's f3 pawn and prepares to take the f4 pawn, to be -2} Qf6 {black protects the f4 to prevent a double attack on f7. This is a good move as black can send the queen to d4 check, and swoop the unprotected white bishop on c4} 7. d3 {white protects the c4 bishops and at the same time shores up the e4 pawn} Bc5+ {quite unexplicable, black attacks the queen in a useless check. The only rationale I could see would be to send white king to h1 for a later weak back rank checkmate but given how behind black is on development, I still think this is a useless move} 8. Kh1 {White king moves out of check} c6 {black advances c6 pawn to prepare an attack on the bishop and release his own bishop at the same time. It's quite fine from white's perspective as in the end, his queen and bishop will be on the same diagonale and can attack anything in that diagonale} 9. Bxf4 {White decides to ignore the impending attack on the c4 bishop and take the pawn to be down -2. White should do everything not to exchange queen. The strategy to gain a huge lead in development would will not be huge if queens are exchanged early.} d5 {Attack on c4 bishop comes} 10. exd5 {Not so good move for black: 1. his king is still in the middle of the board, the bishop is projected twice, rear and front by a pawn. So white takes the pawn. I was worries that black would swoop down the b2 pawn with his queen but then I would have move white f4 bishop to c7 attack the d8 square, and one white had take the d1 rook with his queen, I would have taken the f7 pawn for checkmate} cxd5 {black does not attack the b2 pawn, and responds classically by retaking the pawn} 11. Bxd5 {white takes down the d5 pawn. So far, so good. down -1 and most of black's pieces are still hemmed in} Ne7 {black decides to attack the bishop but at that point, white's bishop and queen are lined up and he can attack the b7 pawn} 12. Bxb7 {white takes the b7 pawn, black does not have a choice here. he must recapture the bishop} Bxb7 {black captures the b7 bishop} 13. Qxb7 {white retakes the b7 bishop and is now even. Even though white only has pawns to show for his lost piece, the game is going well. The only concern is the weak back rank as black could decide to attack the bishop in f4 and any movement would lead to a back rank checkmate, } Qc6 {Obviously black is very anxious not to loose his rook and I have to say I understand. He proposes to exchange queens. No no, cannot exchange queen. The game must go on with queens otherwise, with only pawns for his lost piece, the game would not go so well for white} 14. Qb3 {white take his queen to b3, the only square where it could stand tranquil for a while} Rg8 {black decides to go for checkmate by move the rook in line on g8. 2 choices, move the g2 pawn to g3: not good as that would expose the white king. Or second choice, move something as a buffer against the rook attack on g2.} 15. Bg3 {move the bishop to g3 to protect the g2 pawn. The other benefit of this move is to allow the rook on f1 to join on the attack of the f7 pawn (remember the beginning of the game was geared towards attacking the f7 pawn, so back to the beginning). The risk here again is black attacking the black bishop. If black does indeed attack the white bishop with his bishop (e.g. black c5 to d6), then white would capture the f7 pawn check, then black king to d8 or d7, the white would move the rook to f3 to provide another shield to the g2 pawn} f6 {black decides to move his f7 pawn to prevent it being captured with check. Not sure it is a good move as it allows white a free tempo to free up his other rook} 16. Nc3 {white takes the knight out to provide support to his love active rook on f1} Nd7 {black takes out his knight to liberate his rook on a8. At that point, white is eying the rook on g8 that is now protected by the knight on e7, right in front of the king. Next move, white should aim to fix the knight on e7 with an absolute pin...} 17. Rae1 {white moves the a1 rook to e1 and has now effectively taken the black knight on e7 out of the game. It simply cannot move. So the black rook on g8 is ripe for the taking...} Rb8 {Oblivious to the danger, black decides to attack the white queen on b3. If white takes the rook with his bishop on g3, then black queen from c6 to g2, checkmate.} 18. Qxg8+ {White takes the rook on g8 with check, the only legal move is knight d7 to f8} Nf8 {only legal move to take the black king out of check. All of a sudden the remaining black rook is there for the taking. The threat of checkmate has disappeared with the rook on g8 gone} 19. Bxb8 {white takes the unprotected b8 rook. Black is now down 10 points with no chance of winning the game. White next move would be to move the h2 pawn to h3 to create some air for the white king. However, black resigns....}
