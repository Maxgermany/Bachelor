1. e4 {King's Pawn Opening} e5 {King's Pawn Game. Black responds symmetrically} 2. f4 {King's Gambit} exf4 {King's Gambit / Accepted} 3. Bc4 {King's Gambit / Accepted / Bishop's Gambit.: The most logical continuation off of the Kings Gambit Accepted} Nf6 {King's Gambit / Accepted / Bishop's Gambit / Cozio Defense.} 4. Nf3 {Leaves Opening Book: Clears way for kingside castle.} Nxe4 {Black gambles and uses the Knight to gain additional material. } 5. Bxf7+ {White checks the king and sacrifices the bishop to expose the king} Kxf7 6. Ne5+ {Again white applies the pressure.} Ke8 {Black retreats the king, allowing Qh5+, Might have been better off with Kg8 but I was uncomfortable with leaving the king in the corner.} 7. Qh5+ {Checks the king:} g6 {?g6:  Could maybe have played Ke7, However I expected Nxg6 hxg6 9. Qxh8 and then I would begin to apply some pressure.} 8. Nxg6 {As expected, white applies the pressure.} hxg6 {Logical} 9. Qxg6+ {Qxg6+ !!: This move I did not expect: White was able to fork the Knight and will keep the king in check after Ke7 Qxe4+.  This was a solid move and he really has me scrambling and on the run} Ke7 {Forced} 10. Qxe4+ {Takes the knight and forks the pawn. White has regained most of his lost material.} Kf7 {moves it out of check} 11. Qxf4+ {checks the king again and creates a passed pawn pair on the g and h files.} Qf6 {brought the queen out in front of the king, applied pressure to the opponent queen. I had expected a trade or for him to castle kingside} 12. Qxc7 {Qxc7 ?! Dubious move: White goes after material and take advantage of the weak pawn.} Qe6+ {Checks the king, removes his ability to castle} 13. Kf2 {moves the king out of check.} Bd6 {Bd6 !? Interesting Move: I thought this move was quite good, I removed the threat on the bishop at c8, applied pressure to the queen and developed a piece. After some discussion it appears that Rh5 would have been better as it would have allowed me to bring the queen rook grouping into a position where I would have been able to threaten mate with: 14.d4 Rf5+ 15.Qf4 Bd6 16.Qf3 Rxf3+ 17.gxf3 Qf6 18.Nc3 Nc6} 14. Qc3 {Threatens the rook on h8} Qf5+ {checks whites king} 15. Qf3 {blocks with the queen.} Bc5+ {checks the king, I don't recall why I made this move, but it made sense to me at the time.} 16. Ke1 Re8+ {checks the king, My plan here is to push the king back into the corner before I make the queen swap. White could also have move Kf1.} 17. Kd1 {Moves the king to d1 as I had expected, allowing me to start my counter attack.} Qxf3+ {queen swap} 18. gxf3 {forced} b6 {A rather passive move, but it frees up the bishop} 19. Re1 Bb7 {I move to Bb7, knowing that if I can take the pawn on f3 it will allow me to have a sustained presence in my opponents territory. I also know that if he takes the rook trade offered up to him it will leave him with no pieces developed and a fairly cramped position. } 20. Rxe8 {White takes the offered trade.} Kxe8 21. Ke2 {White sees the weak pawn and moves to protect it.} Na6 {allows me to get the rook out in a few moves. } 22. d3 {He moves to free the bishop} Kf7 {I wanted to get the rook a clear path on the 8th Rank} 23. Nc3 Re8+ {checked the king, just wanted to see how he would respond. I expected Ne4 for the block, but maybe he didn't want the knight pinned down... } 24. Kf1 {Allows me to take the weak pawn} Bxf3 {I take the material.} 25. Bf4 {Bf4?  Not sure what white expected to gain here.} Nb4 {Applies pressure to c2} 26. Rc1 {Removes the threat on Whites pawn at c2} Rg8 {!! Rg8: I spy the potential mate (rook to g1) and control the open file.} 27. Ne2 {White seems the danger and responds accordingly} Nd5 {I passes up the free pawn on c2 and decided to move the knight into position to check the king. } 28. Bd2 {?? Bd2 Danger:  this cramps his position.} Ne3+ {?? Ne3+:  This was an error, The best move would have been Rg2 leading to 29.d4 Rxe2 30.dxc5 Rxd2 31.Re1 bxc5 32.c4 Bg2+ 33.Kg1 Nf4 34.h4 Rxb2.  However White bailed me out by playing Bxe3.} 29. Bxe3 {?? Bxe3  This signals the beginning of the end for white. Leads to Bxe3 and a very cramped white position.} Bxe3 {Takes the bishop, threatens the rook.} 30. Re1 {White moves into a forced mate. Much better is c4. Re1 leads to 30...Bg2# and mate.} Rg2 {?! Rg2, Dubious Move: I missed the forced mate, but I still have a won game.} 31. Ng3 {Gives me another Mate opportunity with: Rg1#} Rg1# {And Mate:  This was my First attempt at an annotation. Comments and suggestions are welcome. Enjoy}
