1. e4 {This is a typical example of Lolli gambit. this opening can be countered by black if they play the right moves, that gives bad lucks for whites. But if Black do any one error in the opening, this is the end...perfect for blitz !} e5 2. f4 {King's gambit. White give a pawn, but they will have a very active game (strong attack to f7)} exf4 3. Nf3 {The knight is the main defence of white king. Without the knight, black can play Qh4  at the rignt time. so...} g5 {Black try to chase the knight.} 4. Bc4 g4 {And now, the knight must move...} 5. Bxf7+ {or not ! another continuation is 6 O-O gxf 7 Qxf3, the Muzio Gambit} Kxf7 {what else ? White gave a bishop, but...} 6. Ne5+ Ke8 7. Qxg4 {the queen and the knight are ready to a strong attack. } Bc5 {bad idea...White cannot castle but this is not a problem. The best move was Nf6, protecting h5. Now, black are dead.} 8. Qh5+ Ke7 {...Kf8 9 Qf7  } 9. Qf7+ Kd6 10. Nc4+ {the king is extracted. } Kc6 {only move} 11. Qd5+ Kb5 {.} 12. a4+ Ka6 {...Kb4 wasn't better because of 13 c3   Kb3  14 Ne3#} 13. b4 {the last attack. Black cannot take the pawn because Qb5#} Qh4+ {a last attempt} 14. g3 fxg3 {what else, anyway ?} 15. b5# {Since 7 ...Bc5, all the lines leaded to a short victory. In long games, lolli gambit may be not the best choice, but in blitz...}
