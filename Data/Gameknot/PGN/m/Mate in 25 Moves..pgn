1. d4 d5 2. h3 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. a3 Bd6 {With the dark square bishop off its home square, my king is ready to castle.} 5. g4 {White sees I'm ready to castle and is planning a king side pawn attack. This kind of attack can leave white's own king vulnerable.} O-O 6. Bg2 c6 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. Bg5 {White moves to pin my knight against the queen.} Be7 {I move the bishop back to unpin the knight.} 9. Bf4 b6 10. O-O Bb7 11. Re1 c5 {This move opens up several options.  If d4xc5 then Bxc5 where the bishop can influence the front lines.  I can also advance the c pawn to c4 and then later advance the a and b pawns to constrict white's movement on the queen side.} 12. e4 {This move does not seem like a good tactical move to me.  Black has 3 pieces that can attack e4 while white has only two to defend it - including a rook which is more valuable than any of the black pieces aimed at e4.  I think Ne5 would have been better here than e4.  If 12. Ne5 followed by Nxe5, then dxe5 advancing white's d-pawn beyond a simple pawn exchange to where it can threaten black's remaining knight.  This also opens up the main diagonal for white's light-square bishop, which is better defended than black's light-square bishop.} dxe4 {Black takes the e-pawn and threatens the knight on f3.} 13. Nxe4 {I think Ne5 is the better option here than Nxe4.  This move means black will be down by a knight after the exchange.} Nxe4 {Black takes the knight and is now ahead in material by one minor piece.} 14. Ne5 {Black finally makes the move that should have been done two moves before.  It opens up a second attack on the black knight at e4 and moves the white knight up to the e5 square where it can threaten pieces on my side of the board.} Nxe5 {I take out the knight on e5 fully expecting Bxe5.} 15. Bxe5 {White's bishop retaliates by taking the remaining black knight, but that is okay since black is still ahead in material.} f6 {Pushing the pawn forward tells the black bishop "retreat or die".  Black's e-pawn is momentarily undefended but that's okay because the rook on e1 can't take it right now.} 16. Bh2 {White retreats as expected because white can't afford to lose a pawn-vs-bishop exchange.} cxd4 {Black safely takes white's d-pawn.} 17. Bxe4 {White's bishop takes the black knight between the rook on e1 and the undefended pawn on e6.} Bxe4 18. Rxe4 {By capturing the bishop, white is now down only by 1 pawn instead of a minor piece.  White's rook can now threaten the undefended black pawn ahead of it.} e5 {Now the pawn is protected and providing additional protection to its colleague on d4.} 19. f4 {White intends to weaken my pawn structure with this move.  If e5xf4 then Bxf4 and the black pawn on e4 is protected only by the queen.  If e5xf4, it's not wise for the white's rook to capture either the black pawn on either f4 or d4 because the black bishop can move to c5 or d6 to pin white's rook.  White's decision to advance the f-pawn has a major downside that will prove the undoing of white's entire game later - white's king no longer has any pawns near it and black can move the bishop to c5 for a later discovered check.  If white really needed to advance the f-pawn, white could have moved the king to h1 and then move the bishop to g1 to prevent any potential of a discovered check.} Bc5 {I chose not to take the bait with e5xf4.  White's f-pawn is out of the way, and my bishop is ready for a discovered check later.} 20. fxe5 fxe5 {Rather than doing the discovered check now, I decided to go through the pawn exchange on the e-file to open the f-file for the black rook and queen.} 21. Rxe5 {White takes the poisoned pawn and steps into the trap.} Qf6 {The black queen moves into place for a check on the f2 square.} 22. Rf5 {White moves to block the queen.} d3+ {Here is that discovered check I had in mind back on move 19.  If Rxc5 then Qf2+ followed by b6xc5 winning the rook.  If Kh1 or Kg2 then Qc6+ leaving the white rook ready for capture by the black rook on f8.  This move also advances the d pawn one more rank towards promotion.} 23. Kf1 {Moving the king to f1 puts the king too close to the dangerous f2 square - which is in the line of fire by a bishop, a rook, and a queen.  Kh1 would not have been any safer.  If black moves Qc6+ followed by white's interposing the white rook between the black queen and white king with Rf3, then black follows up with Rxf3 threatening a discovered double checkmate.  Kg2 might have been a little safer because then the king on g2 could provide additional support (for a move or two) to the rook on f3.  The overall point is that white's king has very few safe options.} Qxb2 {The queen picks off an unprotected pawn.  From here, I can threaten either d3xc2 or Qxc2 to put pressure on the white queen.  My goal is to get the white rook on f5 out of the way so I can later move my queen to f2 for checkmate.  There are not many good moves for white here. 24. Rxf1+ Rxf1+ opens up the f file completely for black's remaining rook. 24. Qxd2 leaves the a1 rook unprotected from the black queen, so white must keep the white queen on the back row to protect the rook. 24. Rb1 or Rc1 are better options for white.} 24. cxd3 {White decided to deal with the pawn threat with a pawn exchange, but this leaves the rook threat on the f-file intact.} Rxf5+ {White can take the rook with the pawn or move the king to e1.  Either way, white's next move is checkmate.} 25. gxf5 Qf2# {With the white rook out of the way, the black queen is free to checkmate.}
