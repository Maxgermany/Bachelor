1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here I missed out on getting my first win against Bob and ended up with my 5th low draw against him.  In the endgame I had the opportunity to win a piece but I missed it.  Just for the record I tried another c3 Sicilian.} c5 2. c3 d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Qb3 Qxb3 5. axb3 {5. axb3 - an early queen trade!} Bd7 6. Na3 Nf6 7. f3 e6 8. Ne2 {8. Ne2 - we concentrate on getting our pieces out and I combine that with some prophylactic pawn moves.} a6 9. d4 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Bc5 11. Ndc2 O-O 12. Be3 Bxe3 13. Nxe3 {13. Nxe3 - the game has opened up a little, now I only need to get my bishop out and I have the option of castling short or long or moving Henry to the second rank as the queens have been swapped off.} Nc6 14. b4 b5 15. Be2 Rfd8 16. O-O {16. 0-0 - I eventually chose to put Henry on the kingside as next move I move my king rook to d1.} Ne5 17. Rfd1 Bc6 18. Rxd8+ Rxd8 19. Rd1 Rxd1+ 20. Nxd1 {20. Nxd1 - after both pairs of rooks have been exchanged we have a 3 piece endgame on move 20!} Nd5 21. g3 g5 22. Nc2 Bb7 23. Kf2 f5 24. Nce3 Nf6 25. h3 {25. h3 - over the last few moves I have tried to improve the position of my knights and have brought Henry towards the centre.} h5 26. Ng2 Nd5 27. Nde3 Kg7 28. Nxd5 Bxd5 29. Ne1 {29. Ne1 - one pair of knights disappears from the board, a two piece endgame now.} Nc4 30. Bxc4 Bxc4 31. Nc2 {31. Nc2 - and now a N v B ending.} e5 32. Ne3 Bd3 33. Nd5 Kf7 {33. ....... Kf7? - black has built up an impressive wall of pawns on the kingside and now decides to centralise his king - but he picks the wrong moment because .......} 34. Nc7 Ke7 35. Nxa6 Kd6 36. Nc5 {36. Nc5 .......... black has dropped a pawn as a result of my knight move to c7.  The black a pawn could not be saved.} Bc2 37. Ke2 Kd5 38. Kd2 Ba4 {38 ...... Ba4?? - should have dropped a piece there due to b3 but incredibly I overlook it with 39. Kd3?? - and even more incredibly I did not realise this until Coach Ion pointed it out in a post-match analysis pm -  a mutual bad hair day for the pair of us!} 39. Kd3 Bd1 40. Ke3 g4 41. hxg4 hxg4 42. fxg4 Bxg4 43. Kd3 {43. Kd3 - several pairs of pawns have been exchanged and it looks as though I am in trouble as black is about to get a passer.  However, my knight shows he can be a little pesky!} f4 44. gxf4 exf4 45. Kd2 f3 46. Ke3 {46. Ke3 - contains the passer.} Ke5 47. Nd3+ Kd5 48. Nc5 Ke5 49. Nd3+ Kd5 50. Nc5 {50. Nc5 - gameknot brings up a message pointing out threefold repition.  I decide to declare the game drawn.  Oooh, I feel so bad about my missed opportunity but it can happen to anyone.  Fortunately in my next game it is Bob who misses an opportunity of netting his 6th high draw against me.  Get set then for Missed Opportunity Part 2.  Cheers - Joanne}
