1. e4 c5 {This was played in a historic match, in that it was the first ever win by Malpas & Oswestry 1 in the Wirral League.} 2. Nc3 {So it starts as another Closed Sicilian. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence#Closed_Sicilian} e6 {Sound development by black.} 3. g3 {White prepares to fianchetto his king's bishop. } a6 {Quite playable, although I prefer to keep options open with 3....Nc6} 4. Bg2 {White completes the fianchetto.} Nc6 {Black develops.} 5. Nge2 {White doesn't want to block the Bg2.} e5 {This looks artificial - black spends an extra tempo making sure white doesn't play d2-d4. But is that such a threat?} 6. d3 {So white settles on d3 instead.} Nf6 {Black continues to develop.} 7. O-O {White castles.} d6 {Black develops.} 8. f4 {The obvious attacking move.} Be7 {Black continues to make the obvious developing move, although there is some logic to e5xf4 to lessen the impact of the following cramping move.} 9. f5 {White cramps black's king-side. This does seem a reasonable plan to me, although Nd5 and h3 are the moves which have been played here before.} h5 {Black seeks counterplay rather than just be over-run by the white pawns. This looks good to me.} 10. h3 {Presuably to meet h5-h4 with g3-g4. We have now transposed into the Gameknot game kocakty (1639) vs. skunk_77 (1753) which ended in a draw.} Rb8 {That game continued with Bd7. Steve chooses another way, which is fairly thematic in the Sicilian. Presumably black is not planning on castling and is counting on the centre remaining blocked.} 11. Kh2 {White gets his king to safety.} b5 {The thematic push on the queen-side.} 12. Ng1 {Seems a bit strange - white is heading backwards!} Nd4 {Black takes the opportunity to jump in.} 13. Nce2 {Presumably to regain control of d4 with c2-c3, but again the knight is heading in the wrong directions - backwards!} Ng4+ {Excellent move by black! Of course, if 14. h3xg4 then h5xg4+ and white has to surrender the extra piece by interposing on h3 with knight or bishop. Fritz actually like h4 here.} 14. Kh1 {White wisely avoids those variations.} Bg5 {This seems to be to be a wise move, exchaning off black's bad bishop, but Fritz actually prefers Bd7.} 15. Nxd4 {White gets rid of the powerful knight.} cxd4 {Black correctly takes back this way, opening the possibility of an attack down the half-open c file. Fritz agrees this recapture is best.} 16. Bf3 {Threatening to take twice on g4. Best now is Bxc1 and then Ne3 and then the Ne3 can't be taken by the black bishop.} Ne3 {But the knight jumps in, forking queen and rook, forcing white's reply.} 17. Bxe3 {Which is to take.} Bxe3 {Black take back. I find it surprising that Fritz likes taking back with the pawn.} 18. h4 {Securing the h pawn.} Qc7 {Black sacrifices a pawn here. Fritz prefers d5. } 19. Bxh5 {White takes the pawn. Steve says "this pawn sac opens lines so I was quite happy".} Rb6 {"rook swinger possible later". Fritz agrees that this is best.} 20. Qg4 {Attacking g7.} Kf8 {Black plays the obvious defence, but Fritz prefers Qxc2.} 21. Ne2 {The knight returns to the square from which it came earlier.} Bb7 {"threat later of d5". Fritz is still liking Qxc2.} 22. c3 {Presumably the point of Ne2 was this attack on the black pawn centre. Steve gives his move a question mark, but Fritz thinks it is best.} d5 {Fritz agrees that this is best, and it looks good to me. The positions seems to be opening, which should help black with the two bishops. Neither king looks particularly happy, but the white one looks potentially worse to me - if the pawn centre dissolves, then there could be two raking bishops bearing down on it.} 23. Rf3 {Fritz prefers 23. f6} Rbh6 {Of course! An excellent move by black. The white bishop on is doomed, it cannot be protected again and is attacked twice, by both black's rooks, and neither can it run away.} 24. cxd4 {Maybe white had the idea that if black takes back with the pawn, he could play 25. Rxe3 followed by Nf4 and escape by losing the exchange rather than the bishop. Fritz actually prefers the pawn recapture.} Bxd4 {I'd guess black was thinking along the same lines as white.} 25. Rc1 {White gains a tempo by attacking the black queen. This looks very natural. Fritz likes this move.} Qd8 {"not sure about this but clock was ticking and it set up the rook sac for later". Fritz gives the following line as best for both - 25....Bc5 26. b4 dxe4 27. dxe5 Rxh5 28. Rxc5 Qd6 with advantage to white (although showing advantage to black earlier.} 26. Bg6 {"good try this". Fritz prefers 26. f6} dxe4 {Fritz agrees this is best.} 27. dxe4 {Steve gives this a question mark, but Fritz thinks it is the best move.} Rh6xh4+ {Well spotted Steve! Fritz agrees that this is best.} 28. gxh4 {White takes.} Rxh4+ {Black takes back. "} 29. Rh3 {Clever defence by white! If Rxg4 then 30. Rh8 wins the queen back.} Bxe4+ {"if 30. QxB, RxR+ follow by Qg5+ winning". Well spotted again Steve!} 30. Kh2 {Clearly best.} Rxg4 {The queen finally falls.} 31. Rh8+ {White continues with his plan.} Ke7 {Forced!} 32. Rxd8 {White regains the queen, but is still in trouble.} Rg2+ {Black correctly throws in the check. As Steve points out, he has two raking bishops the white king is very exposed and white still has rook and bishop en prise.} 33. Kh3 {Clearly best.} Rxe2 {Black wisely takes the knight which was threatening to exchange the Bd4. This way black keeps his attacking force and the white rook and bishop are still en prise. } 34. Rxd4 {White decides to eliminate of the troublesome bishops. Fritz prefers 34. f6+ gxf6 35. Bxe4 Kxd8 36. Bd5 and the opposite coloured bishops give white some chances of saving the game.} exd4 {So of course black takes back. } 35. Rc7+ {White correctly throws in a check.} Kd6 {Black correctly marches his king up the board, and reaches the time control.} 36. Rxf7 {White correctly takes the pawn. Black is "only" a pawn up, but his d pawn is a monster, well supported by his pieces.} d3 {Black correctly advances it.} 37. Bh5 {White correctly attacks the rook, and looks at controlling the queening square on d1.} Re3+ {Black throws in a check. Fritz suggests just leaving it, and playing Ke5 as if white takes on e2, pawn recaptures and then queens. I must admit I don't like this check - the white king is out of the game on h3 and this just allows it to improve its position. I think both Re1 and Rxb2 are better moves.} 38. Kh2 {Fritz thinks this is best.} d2 {And also this move.} 39. Rxg7 {Steve gives this a question mark, but Fritz thinks it is best. Steve says the position "must be winning now" and he is quite right - Fritz puts black at +3.47 now.} Bxf5 {Fritz agrees this is best.} 40. Rg3 {and this move also.} Re1 {Simply exchanging rooks and playing Bc2 was a lot easier.} 41. Rg8 {Fritz prefers Ra3, but still gives black as plus 3.68} d1=Q {Black queens.} 42. Bxd1 {White takes.} Rxd1 {Black takes.} 43. Rd8+ {White tries a check.} Bd7 {But our Steve doesn't fall for traps like that. "fat lady starting to clear her throat now".} 44. Ra8 {White goes after the a pawn.} Rd2+ {Steve throws in a check.} 45. Kg3 {King moves towards the centre of the action.} Rxb2 {White pawn goes.} 46. Rxa6+ {Black pawn goes. I was watching this, and dreading the final pawns being exchanged and Steve trying to win Bishop & Rook v Rook.} Bc6 {Steve blocks.} 47. a3 {"good try this but no cigar". Clearly white is wise to move his a pawn off a white square where it could be attacked by the bishop.} Kc5 {Steve correctly breaks the pin.} 48. Kf4 {White king tries to get back.} Re2 {Steve correctly cuts him off.} 49. Ra7 {White frees up his rook} Re4+ {White throws in a check} 50. Kf5 {The white king avoids any embarrassing discovered checks, which may follow 50. Kf3?? Now I was slightly afraid Steve would play 50...Ra4 51 Rxa4 bxa4 and that the ending is drawn as black has the wrong bishop to control the queening square of the a pawn. However a check with an endgame database shows that that ending is also winning for black if he plays it right, as the white king is so far away.} Kb6 {But Steve played this instead.} 51. Rg7 {and the rook ran away.} Ra4 {Simply Re3 picked up the a pawn and an easy win. "I'm now under 6 mins against his 14 mins but enough time to convert".} 52. Rg3 {White protects the a pawn. } Bd5 {I'm not sure of the point of this move.} 53. Ke5 {The white king is getting nearer the centre of the action.} Bc4 {I'm not sure how this has helped black.} 54. Rg6+ {White throws in a check.} Kc5 {King escapes from the checks.} 55. Rg3 {So white returns to protecting the pawn.} Ra8 {Preparing to check white. Fritz prefers Ra6.} 56. Rc3 {Random rook move.} Re8+ {Check to drive the white king back.} 57. Kf4 Kd4 {Attacking the rook again and again preparing to drive the white king back.} 58. Rg3 {This is a dreadful mistake, but in a hopeless position. After the superior 58. Rh3 Bd3 and Ra8 picks up the a pawn.} Rf8+ {Driving the white king to the g file.} 59. Kg4 {Like so.} Rg8+ {"wins easily after forcing the rook swap. White resigned...I still had over three minutes for a trivial win after swapping rooks, picking up his a3 pawn and promoting my pawn."
