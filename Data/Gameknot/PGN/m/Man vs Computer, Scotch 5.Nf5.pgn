1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Playing a Scotch. I have no idea what the main line is. } exd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 {I wanted to try counterplay against 4...Nf6, but the computer hits me with this aggressive move. It looks like a good move because of the double attack on the knight, and also the next target is f2, which can be attacked via ...Qf6. } 5. Nf5 {!? I had considered 3 possible candidates for this move, where (5.c3 Nxd4 6.cxd4) strong pawn center, (5.Be3 Nxd4 6.Bxd4 Bxd4 7.Qxd4) is okay but not special, and then the text move in this game where I expected (5.Nf5 Qf6 6.Ne3) blocks the attack at f2 while making for an interesting game, or even (6.Be3) can be played for some fun. } Bf8 {? Weak, better is ...Qf6 ^ ...g6. } 6. Bb5 {Playing aggressively, this is a psuedo pin, meaning it is not a pin yet, but it can be, and the bishop line to the king is nice. } Nf6 {?! Seems a little dubious because ...a6 is better, and Nc3 holds e4. } 7. Nc3 g6 {?! This weakens the kingside. Perhaps ...Bg7 is the plan afterwards, but Nh6 can be uncomfortable for black. } 8. Nh6 {!? +/= Played to disrupt operations kingside, prevents castling. } Bb4 {?! Normally this move would be good, but in this case ..d6 looks better because black will want to castle queenside and should be making moves that fit that plan. } 9. Bg5 {!? Applying a strong pin. White has castling options to either side so Bxc3 creates no problems. } d6 {?? Better is ...Be7 to break the pin, now the knight and the rook will be lost. } 10. Qf3 {++/- Losing material is unavoidable for black. } Bxc3+ 11. Qxc3 Be6 {? Hoping to achieve 0-0-0 before a serious attack unfolds, but this move although needed is not the best now, ...Rf8 is better. } 12. Bxf6 Qd7 13. Bxh8 O-O-O 14. Bd4 {?! The text move seemed reasonable at the time it was played, but I feel that 14.Qf6 ! is better due to positional pressure it achieves. } Kb8 {The a7 pawn was hanging due to the pin on the knight. } 15. h3 {This takes the g4 square away from the bishop and provides a means to play the knight towards the kingside by Ng4. } Re8 {A veiled threat against the king, but there is not enough time to achieve it. Its hard to recommend better. Black should want to attack the knight, but how can this be accomplished? Probably some pawn moves could have been played to this strategy, but even that seems very difficult to implement. } 16. a4 {Attempting to draw attention to the bishop and elicit the move ...a6 to weaken the kingside, and provides a cover for the motive of attaining 17.Be2 to assist the mobility of the knight. } a6 17. Be2 {Now there is adequate support for Ng4. } Nxd4 {?? Unsound due to the material imbalance. } 18. Qxd4 c5 {? Black tries counterplay but this weakens the kingside even more without adequate compensation. } 19. Qd2 {A good position for the queen because it supports the knight, avoids ...c4, empowers white on the black squares. } Rd8 {A veiled threat against the queen that does not have the time to be realized. } 20. Ng4 Qc6 {Attacking a weak point. } 21. Nf6 {! A well placed knight which is not easily attacked. } h5 {Takes g4 from the knight. } 22. Nd5 {! An even more powerful position for the knight where BxN is not feared because of the material advantage by white. } f5 {Attack the defender. } 23. Bf3 {! Creating a veiled threat with potential and adding to the defense of the knight. } fxe4 {The pawn was commited and had nothing else. } 24. Bxe4 {Now a move like Nc3 threatens black. } Rf8 {Hoping to create an attack on f2, but there is not a coordination of pieces which would make this possible, and a rook sacrifice is out of the question. } 25. Qg5 {! A very strong move having much potential, and maintains the hold of d5 while providing many attacking options. } Bxd5 {?? Unwise. } 26. Bxd5 Qe8+ {?? This is just wrong. } 27. Qe3 {! Strong, and while not a forced queen exchange, it does threaten this, and it takes hold of the e file while blocking check well. } Qxe3+ {?? Inadvisable, but black is already sunk. } 28. fxe3 Re8 29. e4 {! Cuts off the rook while leaving options for the king. } Kc7 {Black has only one strategy, which considers trading rooks and then taking the a4 pawn, which is not a good plan. } 30. c4 {! Locks down the position even more. } Rf8 31. Ke2 {The idea is to tie the rooks, then Rhf1 is powerful. } h4 32. Rhf1 Rxf1 {?? I expected this, it is a computer after all. } 33. Rxf1 Kb6 34. Rf6 {! The very best move. } Ka5 35. Rxd6 {Achieving so much positionally, the only considerations are on the queenside. } Kxa4 36. Bxb7 a5 37. Rb6 {! Achieving the necessary lock on the king for a quick end. } g5 38. Bc6# {A fun game. This opening was played because I recently reviewed a game where (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 ed 4.Nd4 Nf6 5.Nxc6 bxc6) led to an interesting St. Andrews cross tactic, which I was attempting to play something like this against the computer. But, I do like the 4...Bc5 alternative by the computer, and so this game resulted and provided for some fun play.}
