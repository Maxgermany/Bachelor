Ne4 {you should have avoid me from exchanging the knights as I think that will risk you king's defence. The threat can also be from my pawn d5. You could consider developing ur e7 to e6 or Bg7 or Nxe4.} g4 12. Nxf6+ exf6 13. Be2 Bf5 14. b3 b5 15. f3 gxf3 16. Bxf3 h4 17. O-O h3 {I think u should move Rg8 instead to lock my g2.} 18. Bg4 Bxg4 {rather than exchange the Bishops, maybe u would like to consider Be4, then support it with f5 and subsequently your queen and rook to pressure my defence.} 19. Qxg4 hxg2 20. Rf4 Qd7 {intead of Qd7, maybe u may want to consider Rb7 to support the King's defence as well as to develop ur piece strenght.} 21. Qxg2 Bh6 {what about Be7 to strengten the defence first as well as to protect f6.} 22. Re4+ Kd8 23. Bb2 Kc7 24. Kh1 Rhg8 25. Qf3 Rbe8 26. Rxe8 Qxe8 27. e4 bxc4 28. Bxf6 Bg7 29. Rg1 Bxf6 30. Rxg8 Qxg8 31. Qxf6 Qe8 32. bxc4 Qxe4+ 33. Kg1 Qb1+ 34. Qf1 Qxf1+ {this is a clear mistake to exchange the queens... u should have taken the advantage to take my a2. should i take f7, u can move ur King to b6 and later take the advantage again either to pressure my king or take c4 which will definitely increase ur chances to win should decide to exchange the queens later. from here onwards, i've made a fair calculation that this game is mine.} 35.
