1. d4 g6 {i use to play this defense for e4 and d4, but it works better whith d4} 2. e4 Bg7 3. c4 {normally i play c5, but this time and whant to try something else : e5 if white take e5 i take back whith the g7 bishop and then the white wall center is broken, if not : i take d4 for the same result. if white put his e4 pawn on d5, i block it whith d6 whith it should be quite trong position. so let's what happen !} e5 4. d5 {sure it was the best choice for white} d6 {i find this strong, now i have to castle quickly} 5. Nc3 {just developpement, no risk for the moment whith this knight} f5 {let's be some more agressive ! there is no white queen risk on h5, so i have time enought to attack prematurly on this side. i will castle after. if white take the paw i develop my c8 bishop and brok the white pawn's center. } 6. Bd3 {defending and developing, good response, so i have time to go on. if i take the paw, white take back an then they are very much stronger on the center. and if i dont take it back, they will do it now whith the d3 bihop, they will be abble to exchange bishop and beak my castle, so the only good choice is to advance, witch will give me a very strong position and very ambarassing for white because they can not castle to the queen side...} f4 {f4 ! i am so proud of this nice big and long wall from c7 to f4 !!} 7. Nf3 {white develop knight to castle...} Nf6 {...blacks develop knight to castle !} 8.

Bb2 Qc8 {in case of move h2 h3, i will sacrifice the bishop and take back the white paw whith the queen. this doesnt garanty to win but it's very funy and surprising !} 16. Ba3 Nxd3 {and ont have the choice i had to exchange} 17. Qxd3 {now i will win a paw exchanging bishop whith knight. But first  whant to open the a colon } b6 18. axb6 cxb6 19.

Rf1 {and prenvent this lonely rook} Ne5 {attack the queen and hope to take the knight in c3} 25.

Qxg2 Rf4 {threat to pin the queen } 28. f3 Qd3 {preparing Ne5xf3 !} 29. Nb2 {not a solution for white, i will do it anyway because there will be a check that make me win a tempo} Nxf3+ {check !!} 30. Kh1 {and the end is coming...} Qxe4 {preparing to move the bishop...on e1 !!! if Rxf4, Qxg2++ if Qxe4, Rxf1++ if Rxe1, qxe1+, then Q2-g1 and Rf4 go to f1 pining the queen !  isnt it nice ???!!!} 31. d6 Ne1 32.
