1. Nf3 {Hi, this is my second anotation. He startes with Nf3. I haven't played against this opening before, I think.} d5 {My favorate! The queen's pawn opening.} 2. d4 Nc6 3. c3 {I don't understand that move. It blocks Nc3. I prefer e3.} Nf6 4. Bg5 {Threatens my knight} Bg4 {Counter} 5. Qd3 {Brings out his queen. If he wanted to defend with his queen, I would prefer e3.} Qd6 {Mirroring his moves. I don't know what he's gonna do!} 6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 O-O-O {I castle to get my king away from battle and my rook near it.} 8. Bf4 {Attacks the queen} Qe6 9. e3 {Protecting his bishop} Ne4 {I develop my knight.} 10. Bd3 {Threatens it.} f5 {I protect it. I like this move because it protects the knight and the queen from Qg4} 11. O-O {Castles. I like castling away from the battle and the enemies pieces. That is why I castled long. Now I can aim for the king!} g5 {Opening room for my bishop and threatening his.} 12. Bh2 {He retreats. That move renders the bishops moves.} g4 {Threatening the Queen. Hahaha!} 13. hxg4 fxg4 14. Qf4 {I see the check mate.} Rd6 {I move the rook.} 15. Bb5 {He threatens my other knight. He shuld have kept it threatening my knight on e4.} Bh6 {The queen is trapped!} 16. Qxd6 {Best option} exd6 17. Rd1 {This move I don't understand. Probably making room for the king?} Qf6 {I exploit that!} 18. Rf1 {Returns the rook, why move it in the first place?} g3 {I push on!} 19. fxg3 {Its over!} Bxe3+ {Soon to be checkmate!}
