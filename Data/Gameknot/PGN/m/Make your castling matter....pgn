1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bd3 Nc6 4. h3 e5 5. Ne2 {. Obviously, my opponent went to castling as quickly as possible. Thou, he neglected the center of the board...} e4 {This position of the pawn, gives me a nice control over the center of the board - and I'm playing black...} 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. O-O {And now the promised castling. The question I raise here is: " should you castle at all cost, at the beginning of the game?"} Qc8 {It's Time for a little trap. Just to open up the castling... He should have realized the magnitude of the trap and give up the castle at this early point. Maybe, 8. F3} 8. Nf4 Bd6 9. Nc3 Bxf4 10. exf4 Bxh3 11. Bxc6+ {He did not fall for the trap and did not take the bishop. Good job.} bxc6 12. f3 Bf5 13. fxe4 Bxe4 {The center is mine and his casteling gone...} 14. Re1 O-O {Now my castling matter. I can protect my king and take out the rook..} 15. Nxe4 Nxe4 16. Qh5 Re8 17. b3 Nf6 {At this position it's not a bad thing to change pieces. } 18. Rxe8+ Qxe8 19. Qf3 Qe1+ {He should have prevented my queen from doing this...maybe 18. Bd2 was better} 20. Kh2 Re8 {I join another piece to the attack} 21. Kh3 Qh1+ {Push him towards my knight and pawns} 22. Kg3 Ne4+ {Block his way back} 23. Kg4 {And now the pawns can work their magic} h5+ 24. Kf5 g6# {}
