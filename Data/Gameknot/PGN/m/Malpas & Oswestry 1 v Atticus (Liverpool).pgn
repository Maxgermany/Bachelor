Orlando Bell lost on time, a few pawns down on board 5. Finally Brian Whyte finally succumbed on board 1 in a long closely-fought game.

I fight back, and gain an edge, but fall for a clever trap and lose horribly. Enjoy!} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d6 4. e4 Bg7 {King's Indian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence} 5. f3 {SÃ¤misch Variation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence,_S%C3%A4misch_Variation} O-O 6. Be3 {Usual development.} e5 7. d5 {These are all the mostly played moves.} Nh5 {7....c6 is played slightly more usual than 7....Nh5, but both are commonly played.} 8. Qd2 Qh4+ {I was trying to remember the best move here. I looked at 9. g3 Nxg3 10. Bf2? Nxf1! with advantage to black. What I should have played was David Bronstein's queen sacrifice 7...Nh5 8.Qd2 Qh4+ 9.g3 Nxg3 10.Qf2 Nxf1 11.Qxh4 Nxe3, where Black has given up the queen for two bishops and a pawn, and will also win a second pawn after 12...Nxc4. In return for the material, Black obtains a solid and compact position devoid of weaknesses, the safer king, and control over the dark squares. Cherniaev and Prokuronov were sceptical of whether Black had sufficient compensation after 12.Qf2, but the line is very dangerous if White plays nonchalantly. Also my opponent obviously knew this variation better than me, so perhaps it would have been hard for me to convert! But now I am at a disadvantage in that my opponent knows this variation better than me. I had to think, while my opponent continued to play very quickly.} 9. Bf2 {So played this instead.} Qf4 {He offers the exchange of queens. I did consider playing Be3 and accept a repetition, but afterwards he said he would not have accepted a draw, maybe withdrawing the queen to e7 after checking on h4 again.   However I knew this was going to be a close match, and we were badly out-rated on board 5, I had white, I was only slightly out-rated - I felt I should play on.} 10. Qxf4 {Afterwards my opponent claimed that this was a positional blunder, as it leaves black with a strong pawn on f4, opens up the long black diagonal, and the e5 square to use. However this exchange does score OK for white in opening database.} exf4 11. Bd3 {Afterwards I found out that g4 and Ng-e2 were the moves previously played her.} a6 {My opponent afterwards said that this was to prevent Nb5. I then asked should I have played Nb5 the move before. He replied it wasn't too much of a problem for black with Na6 followed by Bd7.} 12. Nge2 {I continue to develop.} Nd7 {He has a plan to put his knight on e5} 13. Nd4 {But my knight also finds a strong central square.} Ne5 {He hits my bishop.} 14. Kd2 {In in the light of what happens next, maybe 0-0-0 would have saved me some tempi!} c5 {Challenging my knight.} 15. dxc6 e.p. {But I want to keep it there.} bxc6 {The best way to recapture.} 16. Rad1 {Centralising my rook.} Rb8 {Attacking b2.} 17. Kc1 {Protecting, and completing my "castling by hand".} Bd7 {Continuing to develop.} 18. Be2 {Preventing the exchange of my bishop, opening up the d file for my rook, and also protecting f3, and hence preparing g2-g4. If I play g2-g4 immediately, he can  take en passant, play c6-c5, driving my Nd4 to another square, followed by Ne5xf3.} Rfd8 {He also develops.} 19. g4 {I continue with my plan.} Nf6 {He retreats.} 20. b3 {With thoughts of Nc2 followed by doubling rooks on the d file. I wanted to overprotect c4 in case he wanted to play Be6.} Ne8 {So he protects d, rendering my plan useless. Also black is now threatening c5, driving away my Nd4, and then Nxf3 or g4 discovering an attack on my Nc3.} 21. Bh4 {But I have this attacking Rd8.} Rdc8 {So he moves the rook.} 22. Bg5 {And I have this. I did see the combination my opponent played, but I thought "What of it? Material will still be level, as I gain the pawn on f4 and I get rid of his strong knight on e5, his strong pawn on f4, and I am left with pressure down the d file.} c5 {So he continues with his plan.} 23. Nc2 {The only square for the knight.} Nxf3 {I actually thought taking on g4 was better, as this capture draws my bishop onto a better square.} 24. Bxf3 {I take.} Bxc3 {He takes back.} 25. Bxf4 {And I restore material equality, his d6 is now attacked twice.} Rb6 {So he protects.} 26. Rd3 {I hit the bishop.} Bg7 {Bishop withdraws.} 27. Rhd1 {I double on the d file.} Be6 {This move is an ingenious trap - into which I fall! I felt I had to take now, before he protects d6 again. After the game my opponent and I were looking at variations such as 28. Ne3 Be5 29. Bxe5 dxe5 30. Nd5	Bxd5 31. Rxd5 Re6 which appears to be positional advantage to white.} 28. Bxd6 {But I just took. OK, what would you play as black?} Bh6+ {Did you find this? It is a killing check! Blocking the check with knight or rook just drops the bishop on d6, so my king is forced onto the b file.} 29. Kb2 Bxc4 {Which loses the c pawn and the exchange.} 30. e5 {I protect the bishop again, as it is losing a protector.} Bxd3 {He takes.} 31. Rxd3 {I take back.} c4 {another strong move.} 32. Rd1 {My rook retreats.} Bf4 {Attacking h2 and also, indirectly, d6.} 33. Bd5 {Hoping to make something of this attack on c4 and f7.} Nxd6 {He takes.} 34. exd6 {I take back.} c3+ {He throws in a check. The pawn on d6 will fall. If Ka3 it falls with check to his bishop, which then takes on h2. If King moves to b1 or a1 Rxd6 threatens Rc-d8 and as I have to meet that threat, the pawn on h2 goes too. I didn't fancy playing on the exchange and two pawns down against a player of his quality, so I resigned.  Many thanks for reading!
