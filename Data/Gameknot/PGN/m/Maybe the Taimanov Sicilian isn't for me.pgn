[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 e6 {I'm practicing playing e6 against the Queen's Gambit, planning to move into the Dutch without having to deal with the Staunton Gambit or the Bg5 opening.} 2. e4 {And so far, White usually is willing to transpose to a French opening.} c5 {But I don't know the French, except for the first 3 or 4 moves that I learned from a PBS show on the Spassky-Fischer match back in the early 70s (and I went to my first tournament ready to play Black with that information). So I'm investigating the Sicilian in this position -- probably the Taimanov variation since that uses e6 instead of d6.} 3. d5 {And d5 is what I've prepared for as the most difficult drawback to the plan.} exd5 4. exd5 d6 {I can't afford to let him play d6 and lock in my bishop.} 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Bb5+ Bd7 {But this doesn't feel totally unplayable, either. I'll have to deal with a dark-colored bishop that has limited scope at first, but I don't feel at risk.} 7. a4 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. h3 {Usually I hate to play a3 or h3 before the knight or bishop come to g4 (or b4), but that's probably a good move here. I was planning Ng4 to let my bishop out, and I would've looked at moving the knight to e5 if he chased it away with h3 (and my bishop would still be unblocked).} Na6 {So he's not going to trade on d7 and let my knight recapture.  I decided that I'm not so worried about Bxa6 and doubling my pawns. They won't be that easy to attack, and I'll use the b-file for my rook.} 10. Bf4 Nb4 {But no sense in just letting the knight sit on the edge forever. So will he use Nc3 to get the knight out and protect the pawn, or will he retreat the bishop to c4? The good thing about Nc3 for me is that my knight becomes safe from pawns. I'm looking at Bf5 to put more pressure on his c-pawn and it gives my pawn on d6 more protection. If he plays Nc3, I wonder if I can risk a6 and cut off my knight's retreat and then b5. I haven't looked at that in depth yet, but it looks like to win the pawn on b5 (attacked by the pawn on a4, a knight, and a bishop), I would get the pawn on d5.  Lots of possibilities.} 11. Bc4 Bf5 12. c3 Na6 {I figured he'd have to retreat eventually. Next, he'll probably head for c7 if i'm willing to cut off my queen from b6.} 13. Na3 Nc7 14. Bb3 a6 {I think he's moving the bishop out of the way so he can play c4 to protect that pawn better. I'm making plans to challenge the pawn on c4 by playing b5.} 15. c4 Qd7 {He sure has clamped down on b5. I play Qd7 to support b5 if I want to use that at some time. It also lets me sacrifice on h3 if that looks helpful. I have to remember that the Q is guarding the B on e7 if he plays Re1.  I recognize this as a very defensive position for both of us. I want to start playing to prevent him from getting an edge (more than expecting to find a wonderful tactic). I'll use IMPLODES+K to assess this position. I (initiative) - I've got a little initiative if either of us do, but I don't think I have an edge. M (material) - even P (Pawn structure) - probably even. We both have a backward pawn to protect. L (Lines) - even. Our bishops on f4 and f5 control some lines, and my Q is a little more useful in this regard than his. But I expect to see Rc2 eventually. Whichever of us ends up controlling the e-file gets the big advantage here. I can imagine Re8 being my next move. O (Officers - knights & bishops) - looks even. We both have a knight and a bishop that are out of play, but I think his knight can get into the game easier than mine. De (Development) - even S (Space) - White's got the advantage here. King Safety - even   Looks like White has a slight edge with more opportunities to improve his position than I do.} 16. Re1 Rfe8 {There are really two moves I'd like to make. This is one of them, because I can't move my queen otherwise (I keep looking at Bxh3). The other move is b6. In fact, I messed up -- must be getting too late. I had planned on Re8, then I started worrying about him playing a5. As it stands, he can't move his knight from a3 because I'm ready to play b5, but if he plays a5 first, then I've got to deal with the en passant threat. That's what I'd decided to move on the analysis board, then I returned to the real board and made the other move. So now I just have to wait and hope he doesn't play a5.} 17. a5 Qc8 {I thought of playing b6 last move (to stop a5), but I'd underestimated how dangerous it is. He threatens Ba4 to win the exchange, and if I try to block with b5, he takes it en passant with an attack on the knight. And looking at Bxh3, it doesn't seem to go anywhere because he can block with Bg3 } 18. Nc2 {I was worried that he was going to play Rxe7, followed by Bxd6 and Bxc5. Maybe I'll have to play Ne5 to block it.} Ne4 19. Ba4 {That's a strong move. The only options I think I have are Bd7 (which loses the knight), Bxh3 (and I can't get that to work), and Rd8 (which I really don't like, but I don't see another choice).} Rd8 20. Ne3 {Again, nothing looks good here. I've got to give up the idea of Bxh3 and retreat it to g6. White still has a better position, though, way better placed pieces.} Bg6 21. Bc2 Re8 {I've sure got lots of pieces under attack ... or about to be under attack.} 22. Nf1 Nf6 23. Ba4 Nd7 {Looks forced to me.} 24. Qd2 Rb8 25. Rxe7 Rxe7 26. Bxd6 Re4 27. Ne3 f6 {Not thrilled with this move but I don't want him to get a knight into the attack on g5 and make my rook retreat, too. (It's not as if my rook has all that many squares to sit on.)} 28. Bxd7 Qxd7 29. Bxc5 {Gameknot says we're even, but I know that I'm really behind (but not by much). Knights and bishops are really worth 3.25 pawns, and a rook is worth 5 pawns. But, positionally, I'm worried about that passed pawn. If I want to blockade it, I'm looking at Ne8 and then Nd6, except he can play Qb4 to prevent it. Another move I'm looking at is Bf7 so it can have an effect on the center, but I really like that it's protecting the rook for now. My rook on e4 doesn't have a better square to go to, and it threatens to get behind his pawns at some point, and I've got nowhere better at all to put that queen. Then there's that rook at b8 which really isn't doing anything there. So let's move it to a better square, either d8 or c8. } Rc8 30. b4 Rce8 31. Rc1 Bf7 32. Nd4 Bg6 {So I have to worry about Re1 or d6. Let's evaluate:   Initiative - White's ahead   Material  - White's ahead   Pawn structure - even (or White's ahead)   Lines      - White's ahead (because of his control of the c5-f8 diagonal)   Officers  - White's ahead ("officers" refers to whose knights & bishops are better placed)   DEvelopment - even   Space     - White's ahead   King Safety - even   } 33. Rc3 f5 34. Nf1 {So the knight's going to g3 next to fork the rook and the pawn. I can put the rook on e4, but it's not a good position for me, especially after he plays d6. These games are making me feel so tired; I feel like I'm on the wrong end of every game I'm playing.} Nxd5 {I want to play Re1, but after d6, my knight's going to have to go to a8 and never be heard from again. I might as well use it to take out two pawns instead of just banishing it.} 35. cxd5 Qxd5 36. Nf3 Qxd2 37. Nf1xd2 Rd8 38. Nxe4 {What? I know I'm playing lots of games all of a sudden, but I just gave away my rook? I said that I got a high rating, for a large part, because I never timed out or made ridiculously stupid moves â€” and now I've thrown away pieces in two games in a row. Sorry, team.}
