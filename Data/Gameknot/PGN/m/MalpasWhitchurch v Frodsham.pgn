[Opening "Sicilian (B59), Boleslavsky variation, 7.Nb3"]

1. e4 {So he starts conventionally} c5 {I play the Sicilian} 2. Nf3 {He develops his knight, preparing d2-d4} Nc6 {And I develop mine.} 3. d4 {He pushes} cxd4 {I take} 4. Nxd4 {He takes back} Nf6 {I hit his e pawn} 5. Nc3 {He protects it.} d6 {I prevent him from playing Nd4xNc6 followed by e4-e5. This is really the parting of the way next. He can play  6.Bc4, called "Sozin" (ECO code B57). It brings the bishop to an aggressive square, or 6.Bg5, the Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack (ECO codes B60 et seq). The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter's invention, threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable. He plays the thrid most popular move at this point.} 6. Be2 {Quite playable, but perhaps less agreesive that the previously mentioned moves.} e5 {This is the Boleslavsky Variation, named after Isaac Boleslavsky. Black gets a foothold in the centre, but has a backward d pawn on a semi-open file. Both sides have chances.} 7. Nb3 {This is the old move, which used to be considered the "main line". Now Nf3 is more common.} Be7 {So I develop.} 8. O-O {He castles} O-O {I castle.} 9. Be3 {He develops. Now I have had this position before. See http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/hagley-v-kidderminster?gm=44180 In that game I continued with Be6 and d6-d5. There were exchanges on d5 and then on the d file and the game ended in a draw. So I decided to play something else, which seemed to keep the pieces on more.} a5 {I threaten to drive his knight away from b3. If it goes to d2 it blocks the d file, allowing d6-d5 without so many exchanges, and if it goes to c1 it stops the co-ordination of rooks along his back rank.} 10. a4 {So he stops that.} Be6 {And now I develop the bishop.} 11. Kh1 {He avoids any check on the g1-a7 diagonal.} Nb4 {So I get another piece on d5, and also in some variations the attack on c2 is important.} 12. f4 {This is the thematic advance for white in this variation.} exf4 {So I take, preventing f4-f5 and chances of a king side attack.} 13. Bxf4 {So he takes back. Now my d6 pawn is isolated too - but so is his e pawn. I was thinking of playing Qb6 here, with a threat of Nxc2 followed by taking on b3. However that threat is easily met with Nd4, so I decided to play something else.} Rc8 {This move pins his Nc3, as if it moves, I will have both rook and knight attacking c2. I didn't know it at the time, but all this has been seen before. There are 5 games on the Gameknot "World" database, each continuing with Bf3, with one win for white, one for black and 3 draws. Three of these games continued with d5 15. e5 Ne4 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Bxe4. My opponent now makes a dreadful mistake.  } 14. Qd2 {OK, see if you can find my next move.} Nxe4 {Did you find it dear reader?} 15. Nxe4 {He takes.} Rxc2 {And another pawn goes.} 16. Qe3 {Now Pat told me after the game, he envisaged this position after he played Qd1-d2? and thought "Well so what, my queen protects the knight and the bishop, he will take on b2 and then I have to do something about the knight on b3. I'll have a extra minor piece in return for three pawns." Find my improvement on this....} Bxb3 {Did you find this? Of course, if now he takes my bishop, I take his. His queen was over-worked, protecting both Be2, and Nb3. I actually woke in the middle of the night, following this game thinking "Hang on couldn't he play Bd1 here, attacking both my rook on c2 and my bishop on b3?" I pondered the position in my bed, without setting it up. I then realsied I could simply rereat my bishop and if he takes on c2, I take back with my Nb4, forking his Qe3 and Ra1, so regaining the exchange. What he plays next is probably best for him, but two pawns down, it is very hard for him. He tries to make the best of a bad job.} 17. Rfd1 {All his pieces are now very active, my d pawn is under attack. I find a way of simplifying. } Rxe2 {So I take.} 18. Qxe2 {He takes back} Bxd1 {I take again.} 19. Rxd1 {He takes back.} d5 {I advance the threatened d pawn.} 20. Qb5 {This looks good, attacking three pawns.} Qe8 {I was very pleased at finding this. This forces the queens off, as otherwise he loses his knight.} 21. Qxe8 {So he takes.} Rxe8 {I take back.} 22. Nd2 {This is a mistake. Better is Nc3 attacking the d pawn again.} Nd3 {If the knight had retreated to another square, his rook would be covering this square.} 23. Be3 {He retreats his attacked bishop.} Bg5 {I am hoping for him to take my bishop, allowing me to play Nf2 forking king and rook.} 24. Bg1 {So he retreats to a safe square.} Nxb2 {I finally take the thrid pawn.} 25. Rb1 {He moves his attacked rook.} Bxd2 {I take his knight.} 26. Rxb2 {He takes mine.} Bb4 {I block his rook from taking my b pawn.} 27. Rb1 {I was also threatening to play Re1 and Bc4, winning} Re1 {But I play it anyway, forcing an easily won bishop and pawn ending.} 28. Rxe1 {So he takes.} Bxe1 {I take back. I am now three clear pawns up in a bishop and pawn ending. I will play over the final moves without any further comment, as it is a completely won ending. My opponent bravely plays on, after all, you never know, and you learn from playng out such positions. You never gain anything from resigning!} 29. Bd4 f6 30. Kg1 Kf7 31. Kf1 Bb4 32. Ke2 Ke6 33. Ke3 Kd6 34. Kd3 Kc6 35. Ke2 Bd6 36. h3 Be5 37. Bf2 d4 38. Kd3 Kc5 39. Be1 b6 40. g4 g5 41. Bd2 Bf4 42. Be1 Be3 {And white resigned.
