1. e4 {So he starts conventionally} c5 {I play my usual} 2. d4 {He opts for open variations.} cxd4 {I take} 3. c3 {And he plays the Morra Gambit, offering a pawn for speedy development.} Nf6 {Following a suggestion by Leonard Barden and Tim Harding. Also partly as a result of being beaten too many times on the black side of this at Sheffield University by Peter Large. It is quite acceptable to take to pawn however, if black follows it up correctly.} 4. e5 {This is about the only sensible move here.} Nd5 {And so too for black} 5. Qxd4 {This is a bit unusual, more normal is cxd4} e6 {So I have to protect my knight of course.} 6. Nf3 {He develops his knight} Nc6 {So do I, hitting his queen} 7. Qe4 {The queen takes up a central location. For the first time in the game I had a good think. I remembered a game from my university days where I continued with f5, but it seemed to me that f5 left my d pawn backwards, and if I later played d6 or d5 to stop it bein backward, he could just play e5xd6 and my e pawn was backward. I didn't want to leave his e5 pawn unmolested, it could form the basis of a king side attack. Why not play d6 now? Yes that's what I'll play. Now according to Harding and Barden, "Black can equalise with Taimanov's 7....f5". I did find out later that f5 does score better for black, and is more popular, although d6 also scores well for black.} d6 {So d6 it was} 8. Bb5 {Pinning my knight.} Bd7 {Breaking the pin. I am threatening Nxe5 here, so he finds another threat. } 9. c4 {Hitting my knight} Nc7 {Introducing possibilities of taking on b5} 10. exd6 {He takes} Bxd6 {I take} 11. O-O {He castles} O-O {I castle. This seemed normal, although on the opening databases, Qe7 is more commonly played. 11....0-0 is not played in any of the 8 World Opening database of over-the-board games. There is one Gameknot game with this position after 11....0-0, nemours (1706) vs. riva77 (1712)} 12. Rd1 {So he hits my bishop} Qe7 {I protect} 13. Nc3 {He develops. Now in nemours (1706) vs. riva77 (1712), black continued with 13....a6 and lost. Maybe my move I played is an improvement? This position also came up in Stein, Bernd (2380) vs. Kovalev, Andrei (2500), where black continued with Be8 and won, although Be8 seems to me to be undeveloping, and breaking the rule of not retreating a piece to the back rank to break the connection of your rooks. What do you think dear reader?} Rad8 {I developed my a rook. This position } 14. Be3 {So he develops} a6 {I hit his bishop} 15. Ba4 {He retreats} f5 {I hit his queen. The idea is to take the initiative on the king side with e5 and e4. Unfortunately he stops this, so maybe e5 was better, but that does leave my d5 square weak, and he can play Nc3-d5} 16. Qd3 {So he hits my bishop} Bc8 {This retreat protects the Bd6. 17. Bg5 is interesting, but after Bxh2+ 18. Kxh2 Rxd3 19. Bxe7 Rxd1 20. Rxd1 Nxe7 he is a pawn down with not enough compensation.} 17. Qe2 {But now he is threatening Bg5} h6 {So I stop that, he now exchanges on c6, reducing my control on e5 and d4} 18. Bxc6 {He takes.} bxc6 {I take back. I was now expecting Bd4, stopping e5, but instead he plays...} 19. Bb6 {I'm in danger of being slowly squeezed, if e5 he plays c5! and wins, so I played....} c5 {Now I am threatening e5 and my Bc8 suddenly has a great square on b7. I was rather expecting Ne5 now, but he played....} 20. Rde1 {This, also holding up e5} Rfe8 {So I threaten e5 again} 21. Rad1 {He finally completes his development} Bb7 {I grab the long diagonal.} 22. Nd5 {Quite a stunning sacrifice. I thought I couldn't take this, because of exd5 23. Qxe7 Rxe7 24. Rxe7 Bxe7 25. Bxc7  and he gets the piece back. After the game, my opponent thought that this position was good for black. However I thought what I did play led to a plus for black. } Bxd5 {So I took this way.} 23. cxd5 {He took back} e5 {and I finally get in e5, threatening e4} 24. Bxc7 {So he takes here} Qxc7 {I take back} 25. Nh4 {He hits f5} Qc8 {I protect f5 and a6} 26. Qh5 {He hits f5 again} Ref8 {So I protect} 27. Ng6 {He hits Rf8 and e5} Rfe8 {So I meet both threats} 28. Nh4 {He hits f5 again} Ref8 {and I go back and a draw was agreed. Many thanks for reading this, please leave a comment or two, and rate it with the star system. Until next time dear reader!}
