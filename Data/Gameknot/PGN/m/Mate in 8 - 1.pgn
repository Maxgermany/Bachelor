Nf3 {I put some more pressure on the center.} Qd7 {(??) Black ignores the knight better would probably be Bd6, or e4. Now, I have an idea for a combo. Black lets me take a tempo, and a pawn. } 6. Nxe5 Qd8 {I decide to open a diagonal for my queen, and take a pawn.} 7. Bxf7+ Nxf7 {(??) Ke7 would have been the only response.} 8. Qxf7# {Checkmate.}
