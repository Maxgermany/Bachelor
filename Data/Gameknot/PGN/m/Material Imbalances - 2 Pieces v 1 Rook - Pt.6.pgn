1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Well, I never, when I played Expert Jim as black I found myself with a rook against 2 pieces and lost.  Here I played Expert Jim as white and again found myself with a rook against two pieces and again I lost.  Another piece of evidence for the jury that having the rook against two pieces loses, loses, loses!  It is an e4, e5 themed mini-tournament so that is how the game kicks off.  On my third move I deviate from the Lopez, last time I played the Exchange Lopez against Jim I lost so I try The Three Knights Opening with 3. Nc3.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 f5 {3. ..... f5 - an interesting pawn push here!} 4. Bb5 {4. Bb5 - and I end up playing a delayed Ruy Lopez......} Nf6 5. Bxc6 dxc6 {5. ...... dxc6 - ...... and a delayed Exchange Lopez!} 6. Qe2 Bd6 7. d4 Qe7 8. dxe5 Bxe5 {8. ....... Bxe5 - pawn trade.} 9. Nxe5 Qxe5 {9. ....... Qxe5 - piece trade.} 10. exf5 Qxe2+ 11. Nxe2 {11. Nxe2 - queen trade.} Bxf5 12. Nd4 {12. Nd4 - with ideas of going to e6.} Bg6 13. f3 {13. f3 - here I leave behind the db and choose f2 for Henry then Re1 after a move like c3, but things do not quite work out to plan here.} O-O-O 14. c3 c5 15. Ne2 Rde8 {15. ...... Rde8 - pin.} 16. Kf2 {16. Kf2 - as planned, but .....} Rhf8 {16 ...... Rhf8 - a nasty discovery is lined up on the f column.  Ne4+ is threatened, so I prevent this with 17. Nf4.} 17. Nf4 Bf7 18. Re1 {18. Re1 - my rook comes out to e1 at last, only to be traded off.} Rxe1 19. Kxe1 b6 20. b3 {20. b3 - I want to centralise my QR but if I do then the a2 pawn will be hanging to that black lsb, therefore I decide to screen off this diagonal.} c4 21. b4 {21. b4 - I eschew pxp because I do not want to break up my pawn structure and at least I keep the a2-h7 diagonal blocked as his bishop cannot take his own pawn.  Unfortunately my c3 pawn becomes a target as you will see.} g5 22. Ne2 g4 {22. ...... g4 - trying to deflect my f pawn away from e4 which will allow Ne4 next move, so Henry goes back to f2.} 23. Kf2 gxf3 24. gxf3 {24. gxf3 - pawn trade.} Bd5 25. Bf4 Nh5 {25. ...... Nh5 - nasty discovery, Fou Lenoir is attacked by both knight and f8 rook.  If Fou Lenoir moves out of the way then bang goes my f3 pawn.  So Henry goes to e3.  Jim said he thought I should have played Rd1 here. } 26. Ke3 Re8+ 27. Kf2 Rxe2+ 28. Kxe2 Nxf4+ 29. Ke3 {29. Ke3 - Henry returns to e3 and now the dust has settled I have a rook against those two pieces.} Ng2+ 30. Kf2 {30. Kf2 - maintains defense of f3 passer.} Nh4 31. f4 Nf5 {31. ....... Nf5 - that black lsb and that horsie act as The Berlin Wall against Henry.} 32. Re1 Kd7 33. Re5 Ne7 34. Kg3 {34. Kg3 - I try to activate my pieces but Jim has a way of tying them down.} Bf7 35. Re1 Nd5 36. Rc1 {36. Rc1 - my rook is tied to defending that weak c pawn.  If that falls then the black c4 pawn has a very good chance of turning himself into the Wicked Witch of the West!} Ke6 37. Kg4 Kf6 38. a4 Bg6 39. Kg3 {39. Kg3 - what else?} Kf5 40. a5 c6 41. axb6 axb6 {41. ...... axb6 - pawn trade.} 42. h3 b5 43. Rc2 Ke4 {43. ..... Ke4 - that c3 pawn is certainly doomed.  I have no wish to see the Witch again so I wave the white flag.  Could I have played this particular endgame better though?  You the jury decide.}
