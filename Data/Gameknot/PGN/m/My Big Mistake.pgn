1. e4 c5 {My typical response to e4 players. My coach tell me it most popular as well. My goal is to gain advantage over the d4 square with the sacrifice of white aggressive development. Also I don't tend to like to play copycat game (1. e4 e5 ...) but rather pick my own style of play.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {This is new for me. I not see players play this against me before either online or on the chess board. I see if sequence 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 to play. So this make me think a bit.} Nf6 {In the end I choose develop other knight I anticipate the e5 response for white forcing another knight move, but nothing really expose. As I say before this play is new for me.} 4. Nc3 {Not what I expect but it works as well I think.} e5 {Since white choose not to go for e5 I choose to. I predict the next response and set conditionals: 5. Bxc6 dxc6 6. Nxe5 Nxe4 7. Nxe4 Qd4 8. d3 Qxe5 to simplify the position a bit. } 5. Bxc6 dxc6 6. Nxe5 Nxe4 7. Nxe4 Qd4 8. d3 Qxe5 {The queen take control of center position but Black have double pawn but with bishop off board for white it make it difficult to take advantage. Plus the pawn to claim d4 and d5 and queen control e5 so center is good right now. Did I bring queen out to fast?} 9. f4 Qd5 10. Qe2 Be7 {With only knight in center White must use tempo and superior pawn structure to regain position in center.} 11. c4 Qd8 12. O-O O-O {At castle point. White play very well to get space in center develop remain piece and soon can connect rook. Many piece lay not develop for Black and the retreat to start square put pressure on Black to develop and get tempo lost back. f5 is option for Black but I choose not to open position around king yet. This allow white to take f5 and limit bishop involvement.} 13. f5 f6 {To prevent f6 and weaken kingside structure.} 14. Be3 {Develop bishop, attack c5, connect castles. This move accomplish many goals.} b6 {Weaken c6 to protect c5. I also open escape route for queen bishop.} 15. Rad1 {To prepare for d4 advance and potential attack on queen} Qc7 16. Qh5 {I at first not like this move but due to bad calculate on my part I fail to see real threat. It turn out it really is a good move. I only see the weak 2 rank due to the queen come out. I not see how bad my kingside become.} Qe5 17. g4 {My kingside is in a lot of danger but I not see this in game. } Qxb2 {Instead I look for weak 2 rank to place queen.} 18. Rf3 {I again fail to see how bad this would get. This move Black in bad spot with no help to protect the king. It will be end soon. I should play Rf7 last move instead and Bd7 to get rook help to protect weak kingside. But I decide to follow my plan instead.} Qe2 19. Rdf1 Qxd3 {This small compensation does nothing to help problem on kingside} 20. Rh3 Qxe4 21. Qxh7+ Kf7 22. Qh5+ {White fail to see the power in Qg6! This move I would probably resign at but it give me chance to escape with draw.} Kg8 23. Qh7+ {Which white offer at this point and I accept.}
