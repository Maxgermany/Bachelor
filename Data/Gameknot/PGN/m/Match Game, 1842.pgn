1. e4 {The usual.} c5 {Staunton counters with a Sicilian.} 2. Bc4 {Cochrane develops aggressively, but cuts off a future counter of P-QB4 [which if White can get it in, usually spells trouble for Black in a Sicilian.]} e6 {Preparing P-Q4, which would gain a tempo on the Bishop.} 3. Nf3 {Clearing the way for castling.} Nc6 {Beginning his own piece development.} 4. e5 {This move creates a beautiful outpost for a Black Knight at Black's KB4.} Nge7 {"Knights before Bishops."} 5. Nc3 {Continuing to develop sensibly.} Ng6 {Instead of seizing the outpost at KB4, Staunton prefers to double-attack the exposed White KP.} 6. Qe2 {To avoid losing the Pawn. } Nf4 {Centralizing the Knight with tempo.} 7. Qe4 {Leaving the Q dangerously exposed.} g5 {Guarding the Knight and setting a trap...} 8. g3 {...which Cochrane falls into headlong.} d5 {This fork admits of only one reply.} 9. exd6 e.p. {Forced. But now comes...} f5 {...this devastating riposte. White resigns at once. [The Queen's only flight square is K3, but 10 Q-K3 N-N7 ch forks the royals.]}
