[Opening "Robatsch (modern) defence (B06)"]

1. e4 g6 2. f4 {Just one of many plausible options against the Modern Defense, this one being a little more openly aggressive than most.} Bg7 3. Nc3 Nc6 {This move seems a little offbeat, reminiscent of the Nimzovich Defense or the Tchigorin variation in the Queens Gambit. ...Or more likely I just have a bias against not quickly sticking pawns into the center in the opening.} 4. Nf3 d6 5. d3 {Course change. White maintains an aggressive stance with 5. d4 while the text throttles back to indicate a more positional inclination. ...Obviously I'm just a quivering puddle of indecision.  ;-)} e6 6. Be2 Nge7 7. O-O b6 {Considering White's nonconfrontational play, Black's choice of the occasionally unwieldy double-fianchetto, isn't a bad one.} 8. a3 Bb7 9. Kh1 {?! -- In light of subsequent events, this is just a wasted move, and in the wrong direction to boot. ...Hindsight is so important when assigning chess punctuation!  ;-)} O-O 10. Be3 {White really isn't worried about ...Bc3.} e5 11. f5 {?! -- A speculative pawn sac for insufficient attacking chances. But I could see this game tipping toward Black's favor after either 11. fe5 or 11. ...ef4.  Let this be a lesson to you, kids: If you're going to *start* a game aggressively then you do best to follow up aggressively.} gxf5 12. Nd5 f4 13. Nxe7+ Nxe7 14. Bf2 Ng6 {? - Now it was Black's turn to uncork some aggression of his own with 14. ...d5! ripping the center open and giving full scope to Black's Bishops.} 15. h4 Bc8 {?? -- Black obviously wants to begin a direct K-side attack, but the QB is far better placed at b7 where it aims directly at White's King in the corner.} 16. d4 {! -- A push that takes direct advantage of Black's last move.} Bg4 17. c3 {! -- White wants the option of closing the center if that becomes to his advantage, and generally the move also shores up the Q-side. It also baits a positional trap.} Bxf3 18. Bxf3 Nxh4 19. Bxh4 Qxh4+ 20. Kg1 { } Qg5 {?! -- Black wants to push the h-pawn without having to deal with 20. ...Qg3  21. Qe1. But 20. ...Qg3 is still the stronger move.} 21. d5 {White is still in trouble and is aware of it; the text prepares a path for escape to the Q-side ...Black permitting, of course.} Kh8 {?! -- Now it's Black who does a course change, judging (probably wrongly) that his chances live on the g-file rather than the h-file. But Black's best plan (I judge) lies in mirroring what White wants to do, and White wants the h-file for his own pieces! So Black needs to play 21. ...h5!  22. Bh5 Bf6 with the idea of ...Kg7-Rh8. Because White has a Bishop on f3, and Black's is aiming at g2 with his Queen instead of a Rook, making headway on the g-file seems unlikely to force a win.} 22. Kf2 {! -- This is why Black's Queen sat better at g3 in spite of the threat of exchange. White's King will now slip away to almost complete safety on the Q-side, and the h-file will be his.} Rfg8 23. Rh1 Bf6 24. Ke2 {! -- Really spotlighting the poor placement of the Black Queen which is quite in the way of Black's intended attack.} Qg3 {? -- And now this move just helps White climb back into the game.  ------ And I hate to have to jump back in to defend my honor as a player and annotater, but I find it annoying when I, who regularly stand up to Gameknot's rated A-players and Experts rightfully (by my results) *expecting* to win as often as not, am lectured on correct play at length by a presumptuous woodpusher who can't even maintain his *default* 1200-rating!} 25. Rh3 Qg6 26. Qa4 {! -- Of course! White doesn't want his own Queen to get in the way of his counterattack, so he feints (and pretty effectively too) penetration on the Q-side in order to connect his Rooks.} Be7 27. Rah1 Rg7 28. Qd7 f5 29. Qa4 {! -- Daring Black to take on e4.} fxe4 30. Bxe4 Qg4+ 31. Kd2 {Right about now, looking down the barrel of a triple attack on a singlely-guarded h7 and at the smoking ruin of his own attack, Black has to be wondering how this game got away from him. Pretty basically the answer is that White played to give Black chances to go wrong, and he obliged.} Kg8 32. Qc2 {? -- Giving Black an opportunity to simplify, which almost always helps the defender (though not in this case). White should have just played 32. Rh7 Rh7  33. Rh7, robbing Black of any counterplay.} f3 {I saw this just as I entered the Q move to c2.} 33. gxf3 Qg2+ 34. Kd3 Qxc2+ 35. Kxc2 Rg2+ 36. Kb3 Kf8 {? -- But Black has no useful moves. 36. ...Rg7 doesn't even succeed in swapping off a Rook pair after 37. Bh7.} 37. Rh3xh7 Bf6 38. Rxc7 {Black's pawns now will fall like ripe fruit. Black could have resigned, but didn't.} Re8 39. Rxa7 Re2 40. Rb7 Re7 41. Rxb6 Rg7 42. Rb8+ {White forces one of Black's Rooks off the board, and with it any hope Black might have of even salvaging a draw.} Kf7 43. Rb7+ Be7 44. Rh7 {!! -- So it happens anyway!} Rxh7 45. Bxh7 Rf2 46. Be4 Kf6 47. a4 {Once again White plays a move that *ought to* compel resignation. Once again, Black refuses to tip his King.} Bd8 48. Rd7 Be7 49. a5 Rf1 50. Kb4 Rb1 {Is any punctuation necessary?} 51. Bxb1 {Goodnight, Irene.  1-0}
