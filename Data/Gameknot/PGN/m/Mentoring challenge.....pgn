[Opening "Sicilian (B40), Anderssen variation"]

1. e4 c5 {Standard opening for myself.} 2. Nf3 e6 {Again standard for me.} 3. d4 {At this stage I fight not wanting to play cxd4, but everything tells me that is the move to make; and looking at my past experience playing black, my instinctive move is Nc6 - but white usually wins those games 66% of the time with 3% draws.   So in yielding to pressure I'm trying to play the cxd4 line, which I currently have 50% wins but only 6 games played.} cxd4 {So I venture down a path less traveled, for me.} 4. Nxd4 e5 {My experience with this line is extremely limited, I normally play Nc6 the few times I have played this line. But I am not sure why so therefore e5, is something I only played once before and want to know the pluse or minus of e5. } 5. Nb5 Nc6 {I'm thinking development here, ever mindful of the knight on b5.} 6. Nb1c3 {I see double trouble coming.} a6 {I'll try and get one knight to back-off} 7. Nd6+ {To earlier in the game for me to determine whether this will be an open or close game. I don't really have an option any way on this exchange.} Bxd6 {We will exchange.} 8. Qxd6 {Exchange back,} Nf6 {Looking for away to castle, need to get rid of the Queen first.} 9. Bg5 {The pin was expected, seems I always have a bishop trying to pin my knight.} Qe7 {See if he will exchange, or at lest withdraw his queen, so I can castle.} 10. Qd2 Nd4 {probably should of castled, but I like to regain the tempo I lost earlier.} 11. Nd5 {should have castled last move, it was the tenth move. Probably looking back it would have been better.} Qc5 {Trying to get some attack going. Considered Qd6, but thought I should try and go for something.} 12. c3 Nb5 {I don't feel to bad in withdrawing, it might end up giving me a doubled pawn though, if black exchanges with B.xb5} 13. Bxf6 {That takes away using the knight to purse the attack with the Queen.} gxf6 {I need to take back, I don't want to dig to deep of a whole.} 14. Bxb5 {pieces start to leave the board...} axb5 {Here is the doubled pawn.} 15. Nxf6+ Kd8 {need to protect this pawn.} 16. O-O d6 {I'm thinking to protect the d file.} 17. Rfd1 Ra6 {I better start building some kind of defense.} 18. Qd5 Qc4 {It looks like I going to have to play reactionary chess, which I can't stand.} 19. b3 {I was hoping for a exchange, so I could get rid of the passed pawn.} Qc6 {maybe get an exchange here with better pawn structure.} 20. Qxf7 {didn't see that coming at all, that's probably what I should have been worried about along.} Qxc3 {didn't think I had a worry here, with the bishop protecting d7.} 21. Rac1 {again I'm playing 1-move chess here reacting, instead of looking ahead...} Qb4 {Not sure really what to do but probably Qa5, would have been better, looking back on it after I had moved.} 22. Qc7# {I enjoyed the game, and look forward to final comments from charleshiggie.}
