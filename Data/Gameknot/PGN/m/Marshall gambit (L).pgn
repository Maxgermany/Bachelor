Qe2 {Agressive answer} Bf5 {To trap the e rook} 17. f3 Nf6 {I probably should have taken straight ahead. } 18. Bxg5 {seriously weakening the black king} Nxe4 {Trading} 19. fxe4 Bxe4 {Both kings are unsafe and there is a big struggle in the center. I hoped white would be greedy enough to play 20. Qxe4} 20.
