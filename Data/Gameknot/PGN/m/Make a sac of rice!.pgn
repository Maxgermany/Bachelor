1. e4 {Unless I am feeling frisky I always play 1.e4} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {I REALLY hate the Petroff. It is a great defense for black because they can actually just trade off and keep the position pretty much equal if played correctly. In this game you will see how when one breaks from book...then tactics can shatter the Petrof drawing dream.} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. O-O O-O 8. c4 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Nc3 Nxc3 11. bxc3 Bg4 12. Rb1 f5 {Okay here is where it goes bad for black. By playing 12...f5 he of course has offered me the b7 pawn. He also has locked down his white square bishop which will be hard pressed to come to his aid.} 13. Rxb7 Nd7 14. h3 Bh5 15. Re1 {I have wonderful ideas of playing Bg5 and then Be7 with hopes of getting both rooks to the 7th rank which would spell doom} Bg6 16. Bg5 Qc8 17. Qb3 {Qb3 not onlr protects my rook but also hits the undefended d5 pawn which if taken gives check that will allow more of my pieces to get centralized.} Nb6 {Now you might be thinking...Nb6 is good...it disconnects the queen from it so now it is undefended and also protects the d5 pawn. But it is in actuality a bad move due to the following combo.} 18. Rxb6 axb6 19. Qxd5+ Bf7 20. Qxd6 Qxc3 21. Bxf5 {Okay...now both of my bishops are aimed at the king...my queen is centralized and just begging for a better square...my knight is doing his job by protecting the rook...but he would love to get into this...it's sad he doesn't get a chance :(} Bxa2 22. Re5 {No fear of Qa1+, but I have to protect my bishop on f5...or do I?} Rab8 23. Re7 {Of course now Rxf5 loses to Qxb8+} Rbd8 24. Rxg7+ {The crusher! Of course the end is easy to see.} Kxg7 25. Qh6+ Kg8 26. Qxh7# {He could have ran for a second but it was futile. This is a good representation of the power of the bishop pair and how they can not only attack but also defend when sitting together. As for the two rook sacs...this tourney was about sacrificing pieces...so I hope i represented well.}
