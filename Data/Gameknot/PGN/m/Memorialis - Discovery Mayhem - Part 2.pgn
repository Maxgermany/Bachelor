1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 d6 {4. .......... d6 - standard moves of the Sicilian Defence.  I now play Nc3 to develop a piece and support my e pawn.  I think this game will transpose into a kind of Naijdorf.} 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd2 Be7 8. O-O-O O-O {8. .......... 0-0 - both players have developed most of their pieces and have castled on opposite sides - this can involve a race against time in mating attacks and pawn storms but it doesn't quite happen here.} 9. f4 a6 10. Kb1 Bd7 11. Nf3 Rc8 12. e5 {12. e5 - I hope to win a pawn here but things do not work out quite as I expect.} Nd5 13. Bxe7 Ncxe7 14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. exd6 Qb6 {15. ......... Qb6 - after a plethora of exchanges black eschews taking the pawn on d6 and tries a mating attack on the queenside.  Black is threatening a nasty knight fork on c3 as the b2 pawn is pinned so I get out of the pin by playing my king to a1.  Now comes a black pawn storm which fortunately for me does not go much further.} 16. Ka1 a5 17. Bd3 {17. Bd3 - I now complete my development with this multi-purpose move.  Firstly it connects my two rooks.  Frere Leblanc defends the c2 pawn and is lined up on the h7 square, which will become the focal point for a match turning combo later on.} h6 18. Ne5 Rfd8 19. Nxd7 Rxd7 20. g3 {20. g3 - I decide to back up my f4 pawn - the d6 pawn is a gonner but it is poisoned!  You will see how after black's next move.} Rxd6 21. c4 {21. c4!! - After this move the knight must move allowing a discovered attack.} Nb4 22. Bh7+ {22. Bh7  - here it is - a discovered attack.  This is different to a discovered check because the piece which is in line with the discovery is not the king.  The king is in check though and black must deal with that.  Her best move is to take Frere Leblanc which she does but this allows me to take the rook on d6 as d6 is only defended by the Wicked Witch of the West whereas Glenda and one of my rooks is trained on that square.  So black now drops the exchange.} Kxh7 23. Qxd6 Qe3 24. Qd2 Qc5 {24. ........ Qc5 - black does not wish to trade queens as if you are down in material you need to trade pawns rather than pieces - also it will snuff out any counterplay that black will have.  I think that Qe4 may have been stronger than the text move here though as it gangs up on c2.} 25. a3 Na6 26. Qd4 Qxc4 27. Qxc4 Rxc4 {27. ............ Rxc4 - I decided to hand back a pawn for the exchange to get the queens off.  With my next move I regain the pawn and once again emerge a clear exchange up.} 28. Rd7 Kg6 29. Rxb7 Nc5 30. Rb5 a4 31. Kb1 {31. Kb1 - not 31. Ra5?? - this allows Nb3 forking king and rook.} Nb3 32. Rd1 Re4 33. Rb4 {33. Rb4 - I am prepared to double my queenside pawns to get the rooks off.  I will still be able to pick off the black a pawn and support one of my queenside pawns through to crown.} Re2 34. Rxa4 {34. Rxa4 - here I was wondering whether it was better to back up my h pawn.  However after black's 35th move, it turned out to be the right decision.} Rxh2 35. Rb4 Nd2+ {35. ........ Nd2 ?? - black cannot resist giving this check.  Nc5 would have complicated things but I think white was still winning there.} 36. Kc1 {36. Kc1!! - the winner - even Henry comes to the party.  The black knight will be trapped.  Black's best move, which avoids immediate material loss is Nf3 and after Rb3, Rf2, but then I will play a4 and how can black preserve her knight and stop Glenda from making an appearance on a8?  Here is the answer.  Black timed out!  I gained 9.2 points out of this and this brought up my current rating, 1721 - my highest rating so far on gameknot and in my entire life.  At least it will take more than one bad loss to put me under the 1700 watermark.  I just hope I can carry on the good work and have more won games up in this gallery!  Cheers everyone!  Joanne}
