1. e4 {The only way to get better at a game is to review your mistakes. I lost so I must have made some; Thus, I am annotating this game. Feel free to give any constructive criticism for a move you thought was bad or could have been done better. I'd appreciate it.} b6 {This was before I learned how to play the sicilian properly. I would have played c5 instead of b6.} 2. d4 {Trying to control the center...} Bb7 {Attacking an undefended pawn.} 3. Bd3 {Defending the pawn, and developing...} Nc6 {Also developing, while attacking a pawn.} 4. c3 {He defends it.} d5 {Challenging the center control...} 5. e5 {He presses the pawn.} e6 {Opening the queen up.} 6. Nf3 {Developing, and preparing to castle.} h6 {To end all thoughts of Bg5 or Ng5.} 7. h4 {? I thought that pressing pawns where you castle is bad...am I wrong?} Qd7 {I planned on castling queen-side, so I moved the queen there.} 8. b4 {Seems normal.} a6 {To prevent b5.} 9. h5 {...?} Bxb4 {Thinking back, I think this was a mistake. I thought I could press the pawns through... but couldn't.} 10. cxb4 {obvious response} Nxb4 {Again, obvious.} 11. Ba3 {Attacking my knight, while developing.} Nxd3+ {I think this was best.} 12. Qxd3 {Only good choice.} Rc8 {Preparing to press the pawns.} 13. O-O {He castles. Possibly to get the f Rook involved and/or king safety.} c5 {Charge!} 14. Qb3 {Attacking the undefended b pawn.} Qb5 {I think this might have been a mistake.} 15. dxc5 {He's up. Why not trade off?} bxc5 {I think this was the best response.} 16. Nc3 {Developing while attacking my queen.} Qxb3 {Was this the best choice?} 17. axb3 {Naturally.} Ne7 {Trying to develop...} 18. Na4 {c pawn is dead.} d4 {Nxc5 or Bxc5 followed by Bxf3 weakens king side defense...} 19. Nd2 {At this point I saw no chance for black and resigned. Hope you enjoyed!}
