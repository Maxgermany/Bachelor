1. e4 {...this is a quick game....where black has to be a little more careful of nasty tactics...} e6 2. f4 d5 3. e5 Ne7 4. Nf3 Nf5 5. d4 c5 6. c3 Nc6 {...black is developing well..White is looking to set up a clamp position on the dark squares and push kingside...} 7. Na3 {..should have played this move earlier...but i didn't..} cxd4 8. Bd3 Bxa3 {..black gets in a good move to disrupt the queenside pawns...and will gain material as a result...} 9. bxa3 dxc3 10. Qc2 {..i've focussed on development rather than worrying about the pawn, blacks white square bishop is stuck, Ra8 is doing nothing and his only viable option is 0-0....} d4 11. O-O O-O {...Bxf5 will only help black in the position as he has 2 strong passed pawns if he gets active....} 12. g4 {..logical solution..move the knight and attack h7 gaining a pawn back..} Nh4 13. Bxh7+ Kh8 {..Nxh4 is only good for black so the very nasty move is played instead...} 14. Ng5 {..the knight is in a great position and cannot be moved. f6 is countered by exf6 and Qf2 is coming home to take the gold...} Ng6 15. Bxg6 {..with the knight in such a great position its just how the queen gets to the h file to deliver mate...} f5 {..interesting and reasonable move. exf ep or gxf5 allow Ne7 and possible defenses but ultimately Qxg5 will have to be played to save the game.. Rf3-h3 is also nasty..} 16. Qf2 {..the easy way..Qxg5 is forced but after fxg5, Qh4+ brings more pain...}
