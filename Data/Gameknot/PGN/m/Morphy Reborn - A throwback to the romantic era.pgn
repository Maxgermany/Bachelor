1. e4 {This game was beautiful, a masterpiece by a player who seems to be an average chess player. It's true black didn't play that good but white difinitely showed a talent in a morphy-like play.} c5 {Sicialian defense, it's been and still one of the most popular reply to 1. e4 among players of all levels, it was fischer's favorite when he played with black pieces.} 2. f4 {Quite strange, white's usually plays Nf3 or Nc3 at this point, but this move is quite agressive and declares that white is eager for a rather early fight.} Nf6 3. Nc3 d6 4. Nf3 e6 {Black should play Nc6 but instead he's wasting time by pawn moves!} 5. Bc4 Bd7 {Be7 was probably better, clearning the way for a king side castling!} 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 g6 {This move is particularly weak because of white's f-pawn, if instead black simply played Be7 and then 0-0 on the next move, he would had at least a solid position!} 8. O-O Bg7 9. Be3 {Now white is 2 tempos ahead, with 4 pieces developed   castling vs only 3 pieces for black, white's pieces are well posted and look like cooprating really nice!} a6 {Black is wasting time, he made 6 pawn moves in just the first 9 moves! white's advantage is obviously great!} 10. Qd3 b5 {Black attempts to carry out an attack on white's queen's side but he hasn't prepared it with the usual and logical Rc8, Qc7, Nc6 - a5. This attack is premature!} 11. Bb3 O-O 12. f5 {White directly attacks the king's side with this pawn advance!} exf5 13. exf5 Re8 {Mistake, black gave white a free pawn and weakened his own king's side with this unreaonable move!} 14. fxg6 hxg6 {White's light-square bishop is pining the black's f-pawn and exerting a tremendous infleunce on the diagonal!} 15. Qxg6 {Good move, wining a pawn and threatening to win another one with Qxf7!} Qe7 16. Bh6 {White is very aggressive and is threatening to mate in 1!} Nh5 {A mistake, black could have holded on more by Qf8 and then Be6 and so on, but his moves leads to either losing alot of material, particularly his queen or mate!} 17. Bxf7+ {The wining move, just see the similarity between the white player and morphy style!} Kh8 {Kh8?, the worst of all the moves that black could've played, leads to a forced mate in 2, instead black could have fought a while longer with Kf8!} 18. Bxg7+ Nxg7 {Forced!} 19. Qh6# {And a beautiful mate, this game was quick but the tactics implemented were incredible and beautiful!}
