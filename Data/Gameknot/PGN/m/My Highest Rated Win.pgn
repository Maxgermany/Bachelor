1. e4 {The most popular move in chess.} c5 {A popular reply: The Sicilian defense.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. b3 {A weird move, and looking at the World Database, it doesn't look very attractive. Especially as my opponent doesn't fianchettoes his bishop one the 14th move.} Nc6 {Developing the Queenside.} 4. d4 {According to the World DB, this is the best move.} cxd4 {Sicilian B50.} 5. Nxd4 Nf6 6. Nc3 {This position isn't found on either Game DB or World DB. The only move on World DB is Nxc6.} g6 {Almost transposing into Dragon Variation, except for b3 and Nc6.} 7. g3 {Unusual. White still hasn't fianchettoed the Queenside bishop.} Bg7 8. Bb5 {? I think playing g3 is weakening without the bishop on g2. Now he has the same thing on both sides!} Bd7 9. Nxc6 bxc6 {Liking my position.} 10. e5 {? Loses a pawn.} dxe5 11. Ba6 {?} Qa5 {! Wins the knight or bishop.} 12. Qd3 e4 13. Qc4 Nd5 {!! A double threat! Threatening the pinned piece (the knight on c3) with the knight and the fianchettoed bishop..} 14. Bb2 Nxc3 {Free knight.} 15. b4 {A final, desperate attempt to keep the game not too one sided.} Qe5 16. O-O O-O {Also, possibly better: Ne2+ Qxe2 Qxb2.} 17. Rfe1 {Threatening my pawn on e4.} Bf5 18. Re3 Ne2+ {Now I make the move, swapping knight for bishop.} 19. Qxe2 Qxb2 20. Rd1 Rad8 {Wanting to swap rooks.} 21. a3 Rxd1+ 22. Qxd1 Qd4 {Wanting to swap queens.} 23. Qe1 Bh6 {Threatening the rook.} 24. Rb3 Bh3 25. Rb1 {Putting more protection on the back-rank.} e3 {A good move. If fxe3, then: Bxe3+ Qxe3 Qxe3+ Kh1 Qe4+ Kg1 Qg2#. If instead of Qxe3, white plays Kh1, it makes the checkmate shorter.} 26. f4 e5 {! If white falls for the trap with fxe5, then I play e2+ Qf2 (forced, if Kh1, then mate in 2 with Qe4 Kg1 Qg2#) Be3, pinning the queen to the king.} 27. Be2 {Stopping e2+.} Qe4 {Threatening checkmate on g2.} 28. Bf1 Bxf1 {I accept the swap.} 29. Qxf1 exf4 {Free pawn.} 30. c4 fxg3 31. hxg3 e2 {! Threatening the queen and threatening e1=Q+.} 32. Qe1 Bd2 {!! Now, if Qxd2, then: Qxb1+ Kf2 Qf1 Ke3 e1=Q+} 33. Qxd2 Qxb1+ 34. Kf2 Qf1+ {Here, my opponent resigns. Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed!}
