[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d6 3. Nf3 Nbd7 4. Nbd2 {The bishop gives white the opening advantage, since black can't play e5 but white can play e4. } c6 {Somewhat passive. Black can play c5, and in my view he should. } 5. e4 {If I can play it, I will. I overlooked Qb6 from black, which would have lead to the famous "poisoned pawn (b2) situation". } Qc7 {...but this is a little worse, since the Q pins itself... and this pin will be used!} 6. Bc4 {The threat is Ng5, aiming to f7. Easily parried, but still a threat that allows me to develop. } h6 {? Prevents the N's jump, but is a defensive move, hindering developement. My pieces are all out. Black already suffers a bad position. e5 seems to be his passport to freedom, trying to stand for the pawn with Bd6... } 7. e5 {I want that diag free of pawns. No matter if d5 (, Bd3). } dxe5 {Well into my plans. This failure to stop my lsb gives me an idea. } 8. dxe5 {Black N can't retake.} Nh5 {Sensible: trying to remove the nasty dsb. Now, here I wanted to get. Can you see the tactic shot white has? Can black save from it, how, and how it will become when the dust settles?} 9. Bxf7+ {If Kd8 (only other legal move), BxNh5 and white is winning. } Kxf7 10. e6+ {...it would have been better than this! :-)}
