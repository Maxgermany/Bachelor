1. c4 {This is my second annotation. I hope everyone liked the last one. Anyway, this was against another 1300, and he also was very good. I want to say thank you to him for the game (I will be playing him again because this is from a mini-tournament.) So, thankyou:)} e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 d6 4. Bg2 Bd7 5. d3 Qf6 {I don't really like this move, but I guess it is OK} 6. Nd5 {Maybe Nf3 was better, but I don't really know.} Qd8 7. Qb3 {Targeting the b7 pawn} b6 8. Nb4 {Yes, the knight is being pinned to the rook, but it is easy to get out of.} Nxb4 {so far, so good} 9. Qxb4 d5 {? Most people actually fall for this. On first thought, it looks like a harmless move which sort of develops the bishop with tempo. But if you look ahead, this actually loses a pawn.} 10. Qb3 d4 {?? WHY????? This isn't very good at all.} 11. Bxa8 Qxa8 12. Nf3 Bd6 13. O-O Bh3 14. Qa4+ c6 15. Bd2 {??} Ne7 {?? Take f1 goddamnit.} 16. Rac1 {?? Stop it!} O-O {??? By the way, I put three question marks on purpose.} 17. b4 {??? *groan*} c5 {???? *snort*} 18. Rfd1 {Finally! A decent move!!!!!!!} Nf5 19. bxc5 Bxc5 20. Bb4 Re8 21. Bxc5 bxc5 22. Rcb1 {! Taking the open file.} e4 23. dxe4 Rxe4 24. Ng5 {!} Rh4 {notice that I cannot take the rook.} 25. Nxh3 Rxh3 26. Qd7 {! pinning the knight.} Rh5 27. Qc7 {!! This wins black's queen.} h6 28. Rb8+ Qxb8 29. Qxb8+ Kh7 30. g4 Rg5 31. Qf4 Nh4 32. Qxf7 Rxg4+ 33. Kf1 Rg2 34. Qf4 g5 35. Qf7+ Kh8 36. Rb1 Rxh2 37. Rb8# {And this is checkmate. Hope you liked the annotation. Bye!}
