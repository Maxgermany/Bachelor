1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 {A game I lost in my mini-tournament.  I made a mistake at move 38 and maybe the game could have ended differently.} h6 {After the first 3 moves which is where the players begin black played h6 to stop the knight from coming to g5.} 3. d4 {As black didn't capture c4 white moved his d pawn to d4 to block its progress on the d file.} g5 {Black now moves his g pawn to g5 protected by the h6 pawn.} 4. Ne5 {The white knight needed to move out or he would be moving backward with black's pawns moving down so white went with Ne5.} e6 {Black protects his d5 pawn with pawn to e6.} 5. Nc3 {White now developed his knight to c3.} a6 {Black moves another pawn to a6 to stop the c3 knight from coming to b5.} 6. e3 {White now cements his centre with pawn to e3.  White has the LB to develop and can then castle.  Black's pieces are all still on the back row.} Bb4 {Black now brings his DB to b4 to harrass the Nc3.} 7. Bd2 {White protects the knight with Bd2.} Nc6 {Black now develops his b knight to c3 and is also attacking the other knight at e5.} 8. e4 {White pushes his e pawn to e4.  White is looking strong in the centre at present.  Who will make the first move?} Nxd4 {Black takes the protector of the knight with the move Nd4 of course this pawn was unprotected!  The pawn at e3 was protecting d4 pawn but when it moved to e4 then the pawn was en prise.} 9. Bd3 {White now develops his LB to d3 and is protecting both pawns at c4 and e4.} c6 {Black fortifies his pawn chain and moves pawn to c6.} 10. O-O {White castles.} Nf6 {Black develops his knight to f6 and is attacking the pawn at e4.} 11. Ne2 {White moves his knight back to e2 and is attacking the knight at d4.} Bxd2 {Black captures the DB at d2.} 12. Qxd2 {White recaptures the DB with the queen at d1.} Nd7 {Black retreats his knight or may be rerouting his knight to d7.} 13. Ng6 {White moves his knight to g6 and is hoping that black captures and this will leave the king wide open.  Of course it will also give black attacking options but his king is a lot safer.} fxg6 {Black captures the knight with the pawn at f7.  We now have an open file but who will take advantage of it.} 14. Qe3 {White moves his queen to e3 attacking the knight at d4 and is also able to access the f file.} Nxe2+ {Black captures my knight at e2 with his knight and checks the king.} 15. Qxe2 {White captures the knight with the queen.} Nc5 {White is a piece and one pawn down.  White has castled but black hasn't and white's king is looking a lot safer than black's.  Black is behind on development.  Black has doubled pawns on the g file.  Black now moves his knight to c5 attacking the LB at d3.} 16. b3 {White decides to strenthen his pawns with pawn to b3.} h5 {Black moves his pawn to h5.  Black's pawn on g6 is unprotected and this is a weakness which can be taken advantage of by white. } 17. Bc2 {White now moves his LB out of the threat from the knight to c2.} dxc4 {Black captures the pawn at c4 with the pawn at c5.} 18. Qxc4 {White recaptures with his queen and now the rooks are together on the back file.} b6 {Black pushes his remaining pawn on the 7th file to b6 protecting the pawn at c5 as it was under threat from white's queen.} 19. Rad1 {White moves the a rook to d1 attacking black's queen at d8.  } Bd7 {Black now develops his last piece and moves his LB to d7 in front of the queen and is also protecting the pawn at e6 again as it was already protected by the knight.} 20. e5 {White pushes his pawn to e5 looking to block the progress of the e pawn and also blocks the LB which is now behind its pawns.  This move also allows white a chance to capture the g6 pawn which is unprotected.} Rh6 {Black moves his h rook to h6 which means white now is unable to capture the pawn at g6 without being captured by the rook.} 21. b4 {White attacks the knight at c5 with pawn to b4.} Nb7 {Black retreats his knight to b7.} 22. h3 {White must reply to black's pawn storm coming down g and h files so moves pawn to h3.  Perhaps before pushing this pawn white could have moved his rook to e3 to provide protection on the 3rd rank for his pawns.  } g4 {Black pushes pawn to g4 attacking the h3 pawn.} 23. h4 {White stops the progress down the h file with pawn to h4.} Qxh4 {Black captures the pawn with his queen and the white king needs an escape route.} 24. g3 {Not sure white's move was the best maybe moving pawn to f4 would have allowed the king to escape to f2.  However white went with pawn to g3 and attacked the queen.} Qg5 {So black queen moved back to g5.  It worked for the present but who knows how long it will last.  A good move now for white would be exchanging queens rather than pushing a pawn so maybe Qf4 next.} 25. f4 {But white attacks the queen again with pawn to f4.} gxf3 e.p. {However black captures the pawn en passant and moves to f3.} 26. Rxf3 {The pawn is captured by white's rook which is now protecting the pawn at g3.} h4 {Black pushes a pawn down the h file to h4 attacking the g3 pawn and should it capture the pawn then there is the black rook coming down the h file.  White king is in trouble.} 27. g4 {So white decides to push his g3 pawn to g4 and this is protected by the queen at c4.} h3 {Black continues to push his h pawn now to h3 and white is not concerned as it hopes to use this as a shield to hide behind.} 28. Kh2 {White's king moves across to h2 to halt the progress of the pawn and give cover.} b5 {Black now attacks the white queen with his pawn to b5.} 29. Qf4 {White offers to exchange queens with black with the move Qf4 with black queen at g5.  I am not sure that white shouldn't have gone with Qe1 and he would then have been in a good place to capture the pawn with the rook while protected by the queen.  } Qxf4+ {Black agrees and captures white's queen.} 30. Rxf4 {White recaptures with his f3 rook.  So the white king is looking quite safe at present if a little lonely.} g5 {Black moves pawn to g5 attacking white's rook at f4.} 31. Rf3 {White moves his rook down to f3 and out of danger.  White could have moves his rook across to d4 and attacked the LB at d7 but maybe looking to exchange rooks with capture of the h3 pawn.} O-O-O {Black now castles, it never too late! and of course he can now bring his other rook into the attack.} 32. Rf7 {White moves his f rook to f7 maybe better would have been f6 attacking rook at h6 whilst protected by the pawn at e5.} c5 {Black pushes his pawn to c5 attacking white's pawn at b4.} 33. Rg7 {White moves his rook to g7 and is looking to capture the g5 pawn.} cxb4 {Black captures the pawn at b4 and has doubled pawns on the b file.} 34. Rxg5 {White captures the g5 pawn.} Rf8 {Black brings his d rook to f8.} 35. Be4 {White moves his LB to e4 attacking the knight at b7.} Rf2+ {Black brings his rook to f2 checking the white king.} 36. Kh1 {White king moves to h1 and he is still using the protection of the black pawn at h3  He could have moved to g3 and had more options but the pawn could then proceed to queen.} Nc5 {Black now moves his knight out of the LB's capture to c5 and is now threating to capture the LB.} 37. Rg8+ {White checks the black king with his rook at g8.} Kc7 {Black moves the king out of check to c7.} 38. Rd6 {This is the move which I think was a mistake.  White moves his rook to d6 and I think this should have been to pin the knight with a move to c1 instead.  The rook does nothing here it does not even protect the LB which was at threat and still is.} Nxe4 {So now black captures the LB with the knight.  White's other rook is at g8 and not able to protect the king.} 39. Rxa6 {White moves his rook to a6 thinking to protect the pawn at a2 when he should have been thinking about the defence of his king.  His best move would have been to d3 and he would been able to interfere with the kinght at d4 trying to move to g3.  But white was thinking about bringing his rooks together to check the black king but it was too late for that.} h2 {Black pushes his pawn to h2 and the king at h1 is unable to move so this is not looking good.  There is a rook at f2 so cannot use the 2nd row to escape and the pawn stops him from going to g1.} 40. Raa8 {Now black has decided it is urgent to give assistance and moves his rook to a8 perhaps to bring it over to the f file and make it more difficult for the f rook but I am not sure white had considered the harm from the knight at e4 since it is checkmate if the knight goes to g3.  The best move was a3 but this would only have been captured so really the game was over for white and resignation should have followed.} Ng3# {With the last move from black of Ng3 the game is all over for white.  I think this was a good game for both sides but it seems white had the initiative with black's late development but probably black had the plan and white was attacking but did not maintain the initiative.  Definitely at the end white failed to see the whole picture and was busy attacking while his king was a risk.  I will try to keep this in mind by ensuring defence is maintained and pursue the attack on my opponent's king at the right time once my king is safe.}
