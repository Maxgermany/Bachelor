1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {Most chess players prefer the Queen's Gambit declined over the Accepted version. Mostly because it is impossible for black to retain the extra pawn without giving up to much. } Be7 {black play a very solid move. I have played 3. ..C5 adopting a tarracsh style of defence which leads to sharp positions. } 4. Nf3 Nd7 {This move is not black's best. Normally black plays Nc6.} 5. cxd5 Nb6 {Black goes down a pawn to gain rapid development and attacking chances.} 6. dxe6 Bxe6 {A nice developing square for the bishop. However, this leaves the centre in white's control. } 7. e4 {White grabs a monstrous share of the center} c6 {black can not allow d5.} 8. Bd3 {one of the ways to defeat a gambit is to develop normally and make calm moves that strengthen your positon. Bd3 is a very strong developing move that prepares for kingside attacks. As well it clears the kingside back rank so that white can castle. } Nf6 9. O-O O-O 10. Qc2 {White can also play Bf4 to prevent black from developing his queen to c7} Qc7 11. e5 {This allows my queen and bishop some room to move at the cost of allowing black to post a Knight at d5.} Nfd5 12. Bxh7+ {Not 12. Nxd5 allowing black to free up his position. The advantage of this move is that I win a pawn and create a weakness in front of Black's king with tempo } Kh8 13. Be4 {By refusing to capture the knight on d5 I force black to clarify the position. } f6 {A weakening move that creates a serious hole on g6. If Black's idea is to attack white's centre, then c5 was a better try. } 14. Nh4 {exploits the new weakness of g6. } Bf7 15. Nxd5 {White jumps on the opportunity to get rid of blacks strong Knight by exploiting the overwelmed f7 bishop. Plus this dflects the f7 bishop from gaurding g6. } Nxd5 16. Bxd5 Bxd5 17. Ng6+ Kg8 18. Nxf8 Rxf8 {The game is over as white is almost a rook ahead.} 19. Bf4 {prepares for the capture of the pawn on e5 with the idea of centralizing the bishop on e5} fxe5 20. Bxe5 Bd6 {aiming to get rid of white's strong bishop. } 21. Rfe1 {This is the best move because if black captures on e5 then the Rook gets lifted to e5. By which, white maintains his positional superiority over black.} Bxe5 22. Rxe5 {This is stronger than dxe5 because pawn is an easier target to attack. } Qf7 23. f3 Qf4 24. Rd1 Bxf3 25. gxf3 Qxf3 26. Qc4+ Kh8 27. Rf1 {Black resign with loss of more material. If black plays 27. ...Qg4  28. Kh1 wins the rook.}
