[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d6 3. Nf3 {My scheme can be upset by Na5, but nobody (but old chess engines) do it. But it is not all that bad. } g6 {The best against the London... but it has its counterside, too. } 4. Nbd2 {Supporting e4, unless...} Bg7 5. c3 {I'm not in a hurry for e4. I should, but I like to play very solidly against the black's dsb.} Bf5 {I could have played Qb3 or Qa4+ here, with a well known attack. I can trust my opponent will know how to defend properly so I prefer to go...} 6. h3 {Preparing to contrast the lsb. This is the counter of g6, the bishop has to leave the good diagonal. } c6 {I'd prefer c5 here, but better for me. I can play Qb3 or Aa4, but the attack is kind of naive and useless. } 7. g4 Bd7 {Now black is squeezed, though solid. } 8. e4 b5 {Good, it's the good way for black to contrast white's plans. } 9. a3 {Not really necessary, but I wanted to be very calm and don't hurry. } a5 {Black has the good path in mind. Now, I rarely face this kind of attack, and normally I can defend but I have to be very careful.} 10. Bg2 {I'm not sure about this move. The idea is that, sooner or later, my bishop will cause troubles on the big white diagonal. } Qb6 {Not really a threat, but I have to be very careful, again. } 11. b4 {I decide to block the queenside. Since I didn't move the queen I can afford this move. I don't care if my queen ends in a1, I can hold on the center (or I thought so...)} axb4 {In black's shoes, I would have considered strongly c5, now, but I'm not sure that opening the position would have been the best for black. } 12. axb4 Rxa1 13. Qxa1 {This is not a loss of tempo, since my queen does a great job on the a column. } O-O {The wise choice is to castle, but as my normal procedure, I don't castle if it is not absolutely necessary, and when it means attack. Not now, so I will use the tempo to balance the game. } 14. Be3 {I don't really want to play d5, since it opens the black diagonal for his bishop, but a threat is a treat. I'm x-raying a7... maybe, there's something for white, there. } Qc7 {I couldn't make up a good plan after Qa8... but to take it out of there will cost black two tempoes (Bc8, Bb7), and in the meanwhile... well, maybe g4? Well, nothing clear came to my mind, so I went, sadly, for...} 15. O-O {Next time I'll move Ke2 instead. } h5 {Gulp! obviously, why not? Black could get me out of my plan (to attack the kingside), and now he is using it against me! :-) } 16. g5 {The counterside of h5 is that deprives the knight from its good square to go in case of g4. Now, I'm opening my king in a very bad way... I know. } Ne8 {Now this doesn't look too much as an attack... but I have to be careful again. I don't know if I'll be able to use Nh4 for a threat on g6, of if it will be good for me...} 17. h4 {I decided to be "solid", but I am walking on the edge. } f6 18. Qa2+ {Probably, Qb1, threatening e4, threatening g6, would have been better. Black can't go fxg since Nxg5 goes deeply into his king's court. } Kh7 {Now I'm sure he won't dare to take fxg. } 19. Bf4 {Trying to progress step by step, since nothing clear came to my mind. But I forgot that now black can go...} e5 {Ouch! So simple to see! This can be THE blunder. } 20. dxe5 dxe5 {Ok, just stay calm, nothing had happened, still. His dsb is really sad, there. Much better for him, I think, was f5. He granted me a good future for my dsb. Now, I'm sure that after Be3, f5 will come, so I had to be smarter...} 21. gxf6 {Now, if e5 is not defended by a pawn, and the queen is behind... much better! Of course, if exB, fxB, Nxg7, and the game can go on. The black pawn in f4 blocks most of his attacks. } Bxf6 {Bg4 would have been the right choice, I guess. } 22. Ng5+ Kg7 {Look what a nice check Ne6 is... but useless, for now... except that to have my queen in e6. What for? Hmmmm...} 23. Be3 {OOOOk, now that center is blocked, and I have a good grip on the white diagonal (and a useless lsb), I can retreat on a good square. } Nd6 {Good, avoiding Nf3 (must have I prevented it?).} 24. Ne6+ {Let's say that is a sac, and not that I forgot about the h pawn... :-)} Bxe6 25. Qxe6 Qe7 {Q in e6... what for? Well, let's say that on order to activate my lsb without lose tempoes... (but a pawn!).} 26. Bh3 Bxh4 {Let's say that this opens his king's position. } 27. Bc5 {After the queen's exchange, the knight is also pinned. Without the queen, there is little black can do. } Qxe6 28. Bxe6 {I have a bishop pair... will I hold against a strong player? The game is becoming long and multistaged. } Be7 29. Kg2 {The idea is to support Nf3. My knight has a way to act throug b3, a5, but I'm not tempted. } Na6 {He is. I won't lose my bishop pair...} 30. Be3 {Very safe spot. } Nc7 31. Bb3 {Now the bishop pair seems a disadvantage instead than an advantage. Too many pawns on the board. } g5 {Now, the bishops are uneasy to defend from the h pawn... } 32. Nf3 {I have to try to exchange pawns as quickly as possible to free my bishops.} Nxe4 33. Nxe5 Nxc3 34. Nxc6 {Clearence done. Now I breathe. } Bf6 {With few seconds left, I am in a typical situation where it is very easy to miss a knight's fork or something, so the tension is on the maximum. I won't have gone till here just to lose with a blunder. } 35. Nd4 Nc7d5 {Now, the blunder was his. } 36. Ne6+ Kf7 37. Nxf8 Kxf8 38. Bc5+ Kg7 {Ok, now I have a material point up, but what is the right path to follow to stop the pawn and don't lose the advantage in the process? } 39. Ra1 {Try to bother his king with my two bishops and the rook BEFORE his pawns gets really dangerous. Now, let's imagine, I was sweating. TWO knight looking for a dicovered chech so black can take my rook with the bishop. So it was not easy to dare. } Nf4+ 40. Kf1 {...Would I have forgot something? No checks? Fine! :_)} Ne4 41. Ra7+ Kh8 42. Ra8+ Kg7 {Superb. If Kh7, Bc2. Remember that we are few seconds left on a blitz. } 43. Bf8+ {Or Rg8? } Kg6 44. Bc2 Kf5 45. Re8 {Incredible. His pieces are all squeezed, in a good position, and still they are weak. } Be5 {It seems a chess composition. } 46. f3 Ne6 47. Bxe4+ Kf6 {I can still lose a piece very easily if I am careless, but if now I move the rook (Rb8, say) to Kf7, Bd5. Anyway, my opponent resigned here. A pity for two mistakes. but over all an interesting game for my standards... :-)}
