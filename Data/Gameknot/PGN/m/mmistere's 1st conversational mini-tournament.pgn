1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 {This is the last move for the Giuoco Pianissimo opening.} Nf6 5. Nc3 O-O 6. O-O d6 {Both kings have castled and the center is crowded.} 7. h3 {Blacks best move here is Be6, threatening white's c4 bishop without the threat of compromising pieces in the center. After 7. ... Be6 8. Bxb6 fxe6 9. Bg5, while white is pinning the f6 knight to black's queen, black can push d5 and start to open the center.} Nd4 8. Nxd4 exd4 {With this move black effectively blocks his dark bishop from the e through h files. Bxd4 is better after 9. Ne2 black could pull his bishop back to c5 or b6 if he did not want to make the exchange and his pawn structure would remain intact.} 9. Ne2 {Black has another chance for Be6. White's bishop doesn't have much mobility. If white declines the exchange the only square that allows escape from the exchange threat is b5. But after 9. ... Be6 10. Bb5 c6 white's bishop is confined to the a4 square. If white were to accept the exchange with 10. Bxe6 fxe6 11. Nxd4, now black can restore his presence in the center with e5 while maintaining a rook on the opened f-file.} d5 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nf4 Nxf4 12. Bxf4 Bd6 13. Qf3 Bxf4 14. Qxf4 h6 15. Rae1 Be6 {This exchange no longer favors black. After 16. Bxe6 fxe6 17. Qe4, black is now required to use a queen and a rook to defend the 2 pawns. I think 15. ... c5 is better as it defends the d-pawn and open the queen to mobility on the d8-a5 diagonal.} 16. Bxe6 fxe6 17. Qe4 Re8 {Rather forced since 17. ... Qd6(or Qf6) is followed by 18. Qxe6 which still loses the e-pawn, but forces the black queen to retreat or have a losing exchange.} 18. f4 Qf6 19. Qe5 Qxe5 20. fxe5 {Even material is maintained, but black will have a hard time opening an attack on the king.} Ref8 21. Re4 Rxf1+ 22. Kxf1 c5 23. Ke2 b6 24. Rf4 Rd8 25. Kf3 Rd5 26. Ke4 g5 27. Rf6 Kg7 28. Rxe6 h5 {Black drops the rook. Rd8 is much better.} 29. Kxd5 Kf7 30. Rh6 h4 31. e6+ Ke7 {Kg7 may have eventually won white's rook, but black is now unable to stop white's advancing e-pawn from promoting. Without a serious blunder by white, black cannot recover from this position.} 32. Rh7+ Kf6 33. e7 Kg6 34. Rh8 Kg7 35. e8=Q c4 36. Qf8+ {And black resigns. Mate would have been forced within 3-4 moves.}
