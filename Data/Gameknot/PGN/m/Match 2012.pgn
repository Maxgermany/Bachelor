1. c4 Nf6 2. g3 d5 {I was ready for a hand to hand combat against Jose's  English 'matadora' and go straight to open battle form the very beginning } 3. Bg2 c5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Qb3 e6 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. O-O Be7 8. Nc3 O-O 9. a3 {I don't think this move is precise. It weakens the b3 square too soon, and Black's plan is based now on that option } Na5 10. Qc2 c4 11. d3 Nxc3 {the correct exchange before placing the other knight on b3 } 12. bxc3 {Alternative variation: 12. Qxc3 [was the other choice for white] Bf6 13. d4 Nb3 14. Rb1 Nxd4 15. Qxc4 b5 16. Qd3 Bb7 17. Nxd4 Bxg2 18. Kxg2 Qxd4 19. Qxd4 Bxd4 [and black has an easy endgame, although equal in chances] } Nb3 13. Ra2 Nxc1 14. Rxc1 Qc7 15. Nd2 {Alternative variation: 15. d4 Rb8 16. a4 b6 17. Ne5 Bb7 18. Bxb7 Rxb7 19. Qe4 Bd6 20. Rd1 Rbb8 $11 } cxd3 {After 15.Nd2!? black has a small advantage now, due to the hanging pawns on c3 and d3, and the bishop pair } 16. exd3 Bd7 17. Ne4 Rac8 18. a4 Rfd8 19. Qb3 Bc6 {little by little black places his bishops on good squares and the strategical battle growing stronger for the black pieces } 20. Rd2 Bd5 {Alternative variation: 20... Qd7 21. c4 (21. Ra1 f5 22. Rdd1 fxe4 23. dxe4 Qe8 $19) 21... Bxa4 22. Qa2 Bb4 23. Nc3 b5 24. Rb2 a5 25. Rbb1 Bxc3 26. Rxc3 b4 27. Rcc1 Rb8 $19 } 21. c4 {this reply was pretty much forced } Qa5 {not best, due to lack of time.  By now, after 21 moves white had 32 minutes left, while black had 19. Alternative variation: 21... b6 [is the variation given by Fritz] 22. Rcc2 Ba8 23. h3 Kh8 24. a5 bxa5 25. d4 f5 26. Nc3 Bxg2 27. Kxg2 Qc6+ 28. Kg1 Qf3  } 22. Qb5 Bb4 23. Rdd1 Bc6 {forcing the exchange of queens } 24. Qxa5 {Alternative variation: 24. Qg5 Qxg5 25. Nxg5 Bxa4 26. Rf1 h6 27. Nf3 a5 $19 } Bxa5 25. Nc3 Bxc3 {Alternative variation: 25... Kf8 26. Kf1 (26. Bxc6 bxc6 27. d4 Rb8 28. Ne4 Rb4 29. Nc5 Bb6 30. a5 Bxc5 31. dxc5 Rxd1+ 32. Rxd1 Rxc4 $17) 26... e5 27. Bxc6 bxc6 28. Ne4 Rb8 29. Rb1 Ke7 30. Rxb8 Rxb8 $15 } 26. Bxc6 bxc6 {I saw how important it was to recapture with the b pawn on c6, since white has to use one more tempo to recapture the Bc3, black now prevents a passed pawn on the d file, but even more importantly, black will own the b file, therefore, he will be the one with the initiative in this double rook ending.  The only problem was the clock. To reach time control at move 40 white still has 14 minutes, while black has only 5 minutes (!) } 27. Rxc3 Rcb8 {And so we now enter one of my favorites, -if not my most favorite of all chess endings-, the rook endings! } 28. Ra1 {way too pasive!  After the game we analyzed and decide that 28.d4 was way better, even at the cost of a pawn, white would reach a slightly worse endgame, but totally drawn with a little carefulness Alternative variation: 28. d4 Kf8 29. d5 cxd5 30. cxd5 Rxd5 (30... exd5 31. Rcd3 Rb4 32. Rxd5 Rxd5 33. Rxd5 Rxa4 34. Rd7 $15) 31. Rxd5 exd5 32. Rc7 a5 33. Rc5 Rb1+ 34. Kg2 Ra1 35. Rxa5 d4 $11 [yeap, Fritz agrees, we were right. piece activity is essencial in rook endings] } a5 29. Kg2 Kf8 30. Kf3 Ke7 31. h4 Rb4 32. Ke3 e5 33. Rca3 Ke6 34. Rf1 Rdb8 35. f4 exf4+ 36. Rxf4 Rb4b3 37. Ra1 Rd8 {All these moves were played very quickly.  By now White has 2 minutes and 16 seconds to make his remaining 3 moves, and Black has only 57 seconds! } 38. Re4+ Kf6 39. Rd4 Re8+ 40. Kf3 Re6 {Wow! The rush is over (for a while at least!) and we both took a long breath of relief.   The position is totally equal again, and we were on suddend death now. 1 hour per side to finish the game.  We also were allowed now to offer a draw, since we had reached time control at move 40, but neither of us was thinking about chicken out that easily. I only offer draws when there's nothing else to fight for. Yes, the position is equal, but just as equal as it is at move zero, so why don't I offer a draw at move zero? Well, because that's why we play the game, right? All right then...let's keep fighting! } 41. Rd7 {the very first move after tiem control and Jose plays the best one. } Re5 {after 15 minutes of thought I realized I had to do this. There's some danger against my f7 pawn if I allow the other rook to f1, and going back and forth with 42..Re7 43.Rd6+ Re6 44.Rd7 etc, it's just not enough for me. } 42. Rd6+ Ke7 {the idea behind 41.Re5 } 43. Rxc6 Rxd3+ {black regains a small advantage since his rooks will coordinate way better than white's. Also, the white king is open, and could be in danger of being mated... } 44. Kf2 Rf5+ 45. Kg2 Rff3 46. Rb1 Rfxg3+ {for the first time in the whole game, one of us gains a material advantage in the form of a pawn } 47. Kf2 Rdf3+ 48. Ke2 Rfb3 {This is needed to stop the white rooks from getting active } 49. Rd1 Rgh3 {I consider this a strong, if not very evident move.   The mate threats Rb2+ and Rh2 or h1 depending on white's answer are not so easy to meet over the board with your clock ticking down to zero..  Black only has to be careful not to allow a perpetual.  By this time the clock had 15 minutes left for white, and 14 for black. } 50. Rc7+ {Jose spent 10 out his remaining 15 minutes to make this move.  Why? I'm not sure exactly why but he mentioned that he was looking for a perpetual, in any case, he left himself with only 5 minutes in his clock to finish the game, while black still has 14... } Ke6 51. Rc6+ Ke5 52. Kf2 Rb2+ 53. Kg1 Rxh4 {Black's two pawns up now, but Fritz gives only -+0.94 advantage to black. } 54. Rc5+ Ke4 55. Rcd5 {looking for a perpetual once more...  Black must be careful not to fall for it! } Rg4+ 56. Kh1 f5 57. Rd1d4+ Ke3 58. Rd4d1 {with less than one minute on the clock, Jose makes a blunder that should had cost him the game right away! } Rf2 {Alternative variation: 58... g6 $1 59. Rb5 Rc2 60. Rb3+ Ke2 61. Ra1 Rgxc4 62. Raa3 Rh4+ 63. Kg1 f4 $19 [of course the question is: Who on Earth will see such a tactic while playing on blitz mode, and for both sides?] } 59. Re1+ Kf4 60. c5 Kg5 {move 60 and white has less than 30 seconds on sudden death, while black is under 4 minutes! } 61. c6 Rf3 62. Re2 Rh3+ 63. Rh2 Rxh2+ 64. Kxh2 Rc4 65. Rd7 Rxc6 66. Rxg7+ Kf6 67. Rxh7 Rc4 68. Rh6+ Ke5 69. Rb6 Rxa4 {This ending is completely winning under normal circunstances, but with your heart pounding at 150 beats per hour, your bladder full and almost exploding, and 6 hours non-stop of mental torture, we were on the brink of a cardiac arrest!! } 70. Rb5+ Ke4 71. Kg2 f4 72. Kf2 Ra2+ 73. Ke1 Ke3 74. Re5+ Kf3 75. Rf5 a4 76. Ra5 a3 77. Ra4 Re2+ {Alternative variation: [a lot easier to win the full point was] 77... Ra1+ 78. Kd2 a2 79. Ra3+ Kg4 80. Kc2 Rg1 81. Kb2 (81. Rxa2 Rg2+ 82. Kb1 Rxa2 83. Kxa2 f3 $19) 81... a1=Q+ 82. Rxa1 Rxa1 83. Kxa1 f3 $19 } 78. Kf1 a2 {the game is even again! So much effort goes into the thrash can in just one move! } 79. Ra3+ {of course! } Re3 {forced obviously, or the rook -and the game too- are lost. } 80. Rxa2 Kg3 81. Rg2+ Kf3 82. Rf2+ Ke4 83. Ra2 Rb3 84. Re2+ Re3 {and Jose's falg fell when he took more than 3 seconds to play his next move that never was...  I was only hoping that he would take Rxe3 and then black would win easily the pawn ending by recapturing Kxe3!  This game was a nerve wrecking experience for both of us. We fought like true warriors from beginning to end, and Jose didn't deserve to lose in such way, but at the end, justice was done, since black had a big advantage for most of the rook ending.  This is also the longest game we have ever played against each other. 84 moves is our new record.  Also, this game marked the first occasion in this year when one of us won two games in a row for the first time, but more importantly, my victory was very significant for me since by only 2 days short of a one year anniversary from winning a game against Jose with the black pieces. I just hope that I won't have to wait another year to complete such a difficult task again.  Thank you for the game my friend. I'm sure that by beating you this time and in this way, I had only provoked you into fighting out even more resiliently the next time.  Let's keep on fighting!!    -Paco Vela. } 85. Rxe3+ Kxe3 {}
