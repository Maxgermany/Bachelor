[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03)"]

1. e4 Nf6 {I have never played against the Alekhine Defence before, so I'm not very experienced at it.} 2. e5 {I kick the knight.} Nd5 3. d4 {I'm trying to control the centre and gain tempo by kicking the knight.} e6 4. Bc4 d6 {Attempting to undermine my centre control.} 5. Nf3 {Developing and attacking the centre, while allowing me to castle.} Nc6 {Contesting the control of the knight on f3.} 6. O-O {I castle and hide my king away.} Be7 {Preparing to castle. Black is not in a very enviable position (at least for me), because his pieces are in a closed position.} 7. Bxd5 {Probably a bad idea, because it allows exd5, which opens up the diagonal for the LSB.} exd5 8. Nc3 {Developing and applying pressure to the d5-pawn.} dxe5 {Trading and opening up the position.} 9. dxe5 Be6 {Defending the d-pawn and developing his final minor piece.} 10. Be3 {I also develop my final piece.} O-O {Now that there are no more immediate threats, black castles.} 11. Qd2 {Connecting my rooks.} Bb4 {Pinning the knight.} 12. a3 {I want the bishop out of my territory.} Bxc3 13. bxc3 {I made a visual error here, thinking that the f6-knight wasn't there, so I played this instead of Qxc6, because I thought that d4 was a serious fork.} Na5 {Preparing for Nc4, which allows black to exchange his knight for my bishop with tempo.} 14. Bg5 {Threatening the queen.} Qd7 15. Rab1 {Exploiting the open file.} Nc4 {Black won't gain a free pawn (a6) because of Rxb7.} 16. Qd3 {Attacking the knight while keeping h7 in sight.} Nxa3 {The anticipated capture.} 17. Rxb7 Bf5 {Skewering the queen to the c2-pawn.} 18. Qa6 {Threatening to gain a pawn.} Nc4 {? This gives away the chance to break even in pawns. Better would be Nxc2.} 19. Rxa7 Rxa7 20. Qxa7 {I am now ahead by a pawn.} f6 {Threatening the bishop, though this seems a bit risky.} 21. exf6 {I trade pawns.} gxf6 22. Bh6 {I threaten the rook, while getting in a good position to limit the king's movements.} Rf7 {Blocking off the flight square of f7.} 23. Qa8+ {I throw in a check with a mating threat. Only one move allows black to escape...} Qc8 {And black finds it. At least I can gain a pawn.} 24. Qxd5 Nd6 {Black moves his knight to a protected position.} 25. Bf4 {I attack the knight. For the next few moves, my queen does not get a single breath in as it is threatened by multiple pieces and a pawn.} Be6 26. Qh5 Bg4 27. Qd5 Be6 28. Qd4 Nf5 29. Qd3 Rd7 30. Qb5 c6 31. Qb4 Rb7 32. Qa4 Bd5 {Finally my queen can rest.} 33. Rd1 {I apply pressure to the LSB.} Bxf3 34. gxf3 {The exchange has given my king an open file, as well as one for black's rook.} Rg7+ {I am forced to move.} 35. Kf1 Nh4 {Clearing the way for Qh3+.} 36. Qe4 {If the black queen moves wrongly, Qe8#.} Qh3+ {I'm forced to move again.} 37. Ke2 {Escaping while helping to defend f3.} Rf7 {Qe8+ is no longer mate, thanks to this move.} 38. Qxc6 {I grab a pawn in the meantime.} Re7+ 39. Be3 {I decide to block the check this time, as I have no intention of being chased around the board.} Re6 {Kicking the queen. I can now chase the king around.} 40. Qc8+ {Check, as well as pinning the rook to the queen.} Kg7 41. Rd7+ {I bring my rook into play, hoping to get a forced mate.} Kg6 {The only move. Re7 only postpones this move.} 42. Qg8+ Kf5 43. Qxh7+ {I grab a pawn with check.} Ke5 {Mate in one.} 44. Qe4# {Checkmate! I hope you enjoyed this annotation, and you're welcome to post constructive feedback. Good game f00fighter.}
