[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation (D00)"]

1. d4 {I am annotating this for one of my team mates, Andrew "Willy" Williams.} d5 {He plays on Gameknot as "knight_nite".} 2. Bf4 {This line is called the Mason Varation. https://www.365chess.com/eco/D00_Queen's_pawn_Mason_variation} Nc6 {Sound development, but this move blocks the c pawn and prevents c7-c6 to support the c pawn and the counter-attacking c7-c5. 2....Nf6 is most commonly played, and I think is best.} 3. Nf3 {Sound development by Willy.} Bf5 {...and by black.} 4. e3 {Yes, that is what I would have played.} Nf6 {Good development by black. The raid 4....Nb4, threatening c2 doesn't come to much, white can simply play 5. Na3 and then drive the knight back with c2-c3.} 5. c3 {A good, solid move by white. I quite like white's set-up. The Bf4 has been developed outside the pawn chain, and then the centre pawns placed on black squares.  This seems to be a logical developing move, but Gameknot thinks it is a mistake. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=5951167&rnd=0.4397394524167513} e6 {Black too is making sensible moves.} 6. h3 {This not really a mistake, but I don't see the need for it. I think white would be better advised to continue to develop.} Bd6 {Black plays to exchange dark squared bishops(DSB). One could argue that for black his DSB is the good bishop as it is on the opposite colour to his central pawns, so it can weave in and out of them, while for white the DSB is the bad bishop, as it is on the same coloured squared as his central pawns. However in this case the white DSB is developed outside the pawn chain, so is not really "bad".} 7. g4 {A bold advance by white. This has been played before in iceman32682 (1729) vs. josefgor (1556) http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=5951167&mv=13&rnd=0.3453198403913642} Be4 {As played by josefgor (1556)} 8. Nbd2 {8. Bd3 was played by iceman, but this move looks good, developing the knight and attacking the bishop. In fact the Gameknot computer thinks that 8. Bd3 is a mistake and 8. Nbd2 is stronger. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=5951167&rnd=0.4397394524167513} e5 {Black tries to exploit the pin on the Nf3 to force through this move which is positionally desirable, but actually there is a flaw in the idea. Simply 0-0 and preparing e6-e5 with Re8 was better.} 9. dxe5 {Yes, I think this is best move. Usually in these sorts of positions it is best to start by taking with the piece of the lowest value, i.e. a pawn.} Bxe5 {Black takes back.} 10. Nxe4 {White takes the bishop that was pinning the Nf3. If black now recaptures the knight with, say 10....dxe4 then 11. Nxe5 and white has won a piece. White may consider taking the queens off with check first too.} Bxf4 {So black tries this.} 11. Nxf6+ {White cleverly takes the knight with check. This is the only way to win a piece.} Qxf6 {Black takes back.} 12. exf4 {And now white is a bishop ahead.} O-O {A bishop down, black plays for the attack my castling, rather than taking the pawn on f4.} 13. Qb3 {I really don't like this move. I think taking on d5 is too greedy and black can move his rooks into the central files and cause problems for white, for instance 13.	Qxd5	Rad8 14.	Qg5	Rfe8+ 15.	Be2	Qe6 16.	Ng1 I think better for white is either 13. Be2 preparing 0-0 or 13. Qd2 protecting f4 and preparing 0-0-0. White needs to castle urgently!} Rfe8+ {Black correctly checks down the file.} 14. Be2 {White blocks.} Qe6 {Threatening QxBe2 mate!} 15. O-O-O {White panics and gives the bishop back. 15. Qc2 seems the logical move to me, or even 15. Ng1} Qxe2 {So black gets the piece back, threatening the knight on f3.} 16. Qxd5 {White takes the pawn, protecting the Nf3.} Rad8 {But now black has all sorts of threats. What would you play here dear reader?} 17. Qxd8 {I think 17. Rh-e1 was the best move. This has an air of panic about it again.} Nxd8 {Black takes back.} 18. Rhe1 {And now this move comes in. What would you play dear reader?} Qxe1 {Did you see 18.....Qb5! and black keeps the extra queen and protects the rook on e8? Black would have been a clear queen for rook up.} 19. Nxe1 {With the exchange of errors we have now reached a fairly level ending. White has the extra pawn on the king side, but it is doubled, and difficult to convert to a win. I would predict a draw from here.} Nc6 {Black improves the position of his knight, feeing his rook for action.} 20. Nf3 {As does white.} g6 {Presumably played to give his king a flight square, but Kf8 was a better move if he was afraid of that.} 21. Rd7 {White correctly takes the 7th rank.} Re2 {Black also seems to be playing copy-cat.} 22. Ng5 {White attacks f7, but I would have been minded just to start taking black's pawns with 22. Rxc7.} Re7 {Black hurries back to defend, losing a move in the process. If black wants to defend like this, he should have done it a move earlier.} 23. Rd5 {As white is a pawn up, I would have exchanged rooks, following the advice "If you are material up exchange pieces, but not pawns".} f6 {Black hits the knight.} 24. Nf3 {Knight drops back.} Re6 {Not sure of the point of this move. 24.....Kf7 seemed more logical. In the ending the king can be a useful attacking piece and needs to be centralised.} 25. h4 {Although in the ending pawns do have to be advanced, this is premature. 25. Kd2 strikes me as being a good move, or 25. Rd7.} Re4 {Black attacks the extra pawn.} 26. f5 {White tries to keep his extra pawn.} Rf4 {Black attacks the knight.} 27. Rd3 {Rook drops back. I think black has a small advantage now. Black can regain the pawn.... However...} Ne5 {I have no idea why black chose this rather than 27......Rxg4 or 27.....gxf5 28. gxf5 Rxf5, with a level ending.} 28. Rd8+ {Now the rook comes in.} Kf7 {King advances.} 29. fxg6+ {White takes. Now black can take back with king, knight or pawn and still have a reasonable position. However....} Ke7 {Black hopes to gain a tempo by attacking the rook. Find white's next move.} 30. g7 {Excellent play by white. The winning move!} Rxg4 {The only way to prevent white from having an extra queen for the rest of the game.} 31. g8=Q {White queens anyway.} Rxg8 {Black takes.} 32. Rxg8 {White takes back.} Nxf3 {Black has managed to escape with "Only" being the exchange down.} 33. Rg7+ {This wins at least one extra pawn.} Kf8 {Another mistake, returning the king to the back rank is suicidal. It is lost, but 33.....Kd6 puts up a better fight.} 34. Rxc7 {Black's pawns are dropping like ripe apples.} Ne5 {34.....Nxh4 was better.} 35. Rxh7 {Another one bites the dust! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE} Nd3+ {Black throws in the check.} 36. Kc2 {White attacks the knight.} Nxf2 {Black gets a pawn back. I was getting quite excited here. We were 2-0 up in a four board match, so we only needed a win or a draw here to win the match, and I was confident that Willy could win this.} 37. h5 {Passed pawns must be pushed!} Kg8 {King comes over to block.} 38. Rxb7 {Another one goes.} Ne4 {I am not sure of the point of this move.} 39. Re7 {White attacks the knight.} Ng5 {Knight returns to the king side. White's h pawn is not going anywhere now.} 40. c4 {So white just advances his c pawn instead.} f5 {Black too has hopes of promoting a pawn.} 41. c5 {White carries on.} f4 {So does black.} 42. c6 {White carries on relentlessly. If black continues to advance then white will queen with checkmate - 42....f3 43 c7 f2 44 c8=Q mate. } Nf7 {So the knight tries to come back to stop the pawn.} 43. Rxf7 {Excellent move by white. The pawn ending is easily won.} Kxf7 {Black takes.} 44. c7 {Whate advances.} f3 {Black adavances.} 45. c8=Q {White queens.} f2 {Black advances.} 46. Qh3 {The queen comes back to stop the pawn, so Black resigned. Many thanks for reading this. Please judge the annotation with the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
