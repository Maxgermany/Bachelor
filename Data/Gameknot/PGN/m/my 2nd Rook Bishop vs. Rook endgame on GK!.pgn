1. a4 a5 2. b4 b5 3. c4 c5 4. d4 d5 5. e4 e5 6. f4 f5 7. g4 g5 8. h4 h5 9. cxd5 {White plans Bxb5+ capturing a pawn with tempo.} fxe4 {I plan Qxd5 centralizing queen, or Bxg4} 10. Bxb5+ Bd7 {moving king is probably better} 11. bxc5 {taking a second pawn} Bxb5 {This gives White a third passed pawn} 12. axb5 Qxd5 13. fxe5 {White has 4 connected passed pawns} e3 {threatening rook} 14. Qf3 {blocking and will win my e-pawn} Qxf3 15. Nxf3 hxg4 {opening h-file for my rook} 16. Nxg5 Ne7 {going to defend with Nf5 if White bishop does not take e3} 17. Bxe3 Nf5 {White should keep bishop defending d4 and White wins easily} 18. Bd2 {? leaves d4 hanging} Nxd4 {threatening fork} 19. Rxa5 {White probably wanted to win the a5-pawn, but maintaining d4 was more important, it was holding together the entire pawn center.} Rxa5 20. Bxa5 Nxb5 {Now White's pawn center is weak and I have drawing chances} 21. Bb6 {defends} Be7 {threatens knight} 22. Ne4 {moves out of way, but h-pawn falls} Bxh4+ {I did not want to trade rooks} 23. Ke2 Nd7 {attacking e5} 24. Nd6+ {White trades knights to bring e5 to d6} Nxd6 25. exd6 {those pawns look sort of dangerous } Nxb6 {So I destroy pawn structure} 26. cxb6 {pawns still look dangerous} Kd7 {but no way for White to promote} 27. Nd2 Kxd6 28. Nc4+ Kc5 {Here I thought I would lose my g-pawn for sure, and then I only have about 50-60% winning chances in the resulting endgame of Rook Bishop vs. Rook Knight.} 29. Ne5 Kxb6 {knight should take g4} 30. Ng6 {?? trying to win a piece by fork, but now my winning chances have risen from 50-60% to about 75-85%} Re8+ {he must not have seen the check} 31. Kf1 Bg5 {so now I have one extra pawn. White still has 15-25% drawing chances, but if I win the knight for the pawn, then we can pretty much consider it a win for me, since my opponent is not a grandmaster, and is unlikely to learn grandmaster endgame technique before timeout.} 32. Kg2 Re6 {trying to trap knight} 33. Kg3 {?? Instead of trying to save knight, White simply trades it for the pawn, hoping to get a draw in Rook Bishop vs. Rook} Rxg6 34. Kxg4 {but White is not a grandmaster, nor a player at judochess.com, so he has no business trying to draw this endgame, better was to keep the knight} Bd2+ {trying to centralize bishop, I will use it as shield against enemy rook while I  invade with my king} 35. Kf3 Re6 {keeping king confined to the kingside} 36. Rh5 {trying to keep my king confined to its own territory, but I have a bishop for shield} Bb4 {planning to cross the 5th rank with bishop as shield} 37. Rd5 Bc5 38. Rd1 {Rook switches direction} Kb5 39. Rd7 {Trying to trap my king on the queenside, but my extra bishop allows my king to pass through his rook's line of fire} Kc4 {planning Bd4 next and Kd3, thematic advancing moves (note that this is a frequently occurring endgame on judochess.com, so just about every judochess.com player knows how to play this, even for regular chess)} 40. Kf4 Bd4 {shielding d-file} 41. Kf5 Re1 {safety rook} 42. Kf4 Kd3 {threatening to gain territory with Rf1+ the bishop has good defensive value,} 43. Kf5 {planning to escape with Ke6 if Rf1+} Re5+ {better might be Rf1+ Ke6 Ke4, which would de-value the White rook while leaving other pieces' values unchanged} 44. Kf4 {Kf6 was safe since rook is close enough for king to defend it from discovered attack} Re6 {planning to gain ground with Rf6+ White can try stopping it with Rd5-Rf5, but simplest is for White rook to aim for the "Cochrane" defense by bringing rook to 4th rank with something like Rb7! Rf6+ Kg5 Ke4 Rb4!} 45. Kf5 {waste of move} Rf6+ {since both e5 & e6 are defended, this is one of the factors that causes this to be a grandmaster-level endgame. The kings do not actually have to be directly facing each other in order to make these thematic advancing maneuvers.} 46. Kg4 {now king confined to g & h-files} Ke4 {This current arrangement of the kings and bishop is the most instructive to study, because it thematically occurs at every area of the board, so it is useful to have pre-knowledge} 47. Re7+ {bishop is very strong in this endgame, because it can block checks while improving its position} Be5 {bishop value is boosted} 48. Rh7 {?? a terrible blunder But not surprising, considering that my opponent is neither a judochess.com player, nor a grandmaster, I should be expected to win.} Rg6+ {now king confined to just h-file} 49. Kh5 Kf5 {Don't waste time getting rook to safety when you do not have to. It is much stronger to invade with king, leading to decisive checkmating threats.} 50. Rf7+ {The bishop block prevents White from winning/exchanging rook} Bf6 {White tried a last desperate attempt to activate rook} 51. Rb7 {but it is no big deal since my bishop can block on e5 while maintaining value Rg1 Rb5+ Be5 Rb4 leads to the "Philidor" position, which is a book win, but I can win faster by driving king to h6 first} Rg5+ {this time rook is not close, so discovered attack would win the rook } 52. Kh6 {only move} Rg1 {Kh7 Rh1+ Kg8 Rh8+ Kf7 Rh7+} 53. Rb5+ {The difference between this position and the "Philidor" is that there will be no Rb4 blocking maneuver} Be5 {With K on h5, White could hold on longer with Rb4.} 54. Kh7 {but here White is losing immediately} Rg7+ 55. Kh6 {forced} Ra7 {With the tactical motif Bf4+ Kh5 Rh7#} 56. Rc5 {White can't do anything but keep the bishop pinned} Ra1 {threatening checkmate} 57. Kh7 {stopping it} Ra8 {threatening checkmate again, this time it is decisive. White resigned. This is one of those endgames that requires pre-knowledge. An untrained player has virtually 0% chance of holding the draw.}
