1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {I perfected this move long ago.} Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 {A VERY aggresive move. The right move would be is Bf1, and the master did it.} 6. Bf1 Nxd5 7. Bxb5 {The reason for Bf1 is so if i took the pawn with the queen, you would defend the g2 pawn.} Bb7 {Would be stuid if i ook the knight.} 8. Qf3 {Nice move!} Qxg5 9. Qxd5 Qf6 10. Nc3 Rd8 {Attacking the queen.} 11. Qf3 {Nt the best move, better was Qe4} Qxf3 12. gxf3 a6 {I jate the pin on my knight.} 13. Ba4 {Still keeping the pin in place.} Bb4 14. a3 Bxc3 15. dxc3 Ke7 {Why would i castle if there is an open file there?} 16. f4 {Terrible move!} exf4 17. Bxf4 Nd4 {Now the bishop is attacking the rook on h1.} 18. Rf1 {If Rg1, then Nf3 with a fork.} Nf3+ {Still Nf3.} 19. Ke2 {Forced.} g5 {Here i gave up a pawn for an attack.} 20. Bxc7 Rd2+ 21. Ke3 {King is coming up the board. "Hey white king," says the black king "Do yu want a playdate at my place?"} f5 {Nice!} 22. Rad1 f4+ 23. Bxf4 {Forced.} gxf4+ 24. Kxf4 Rxd1 25. Rxd1 Rf8+ {And this is all i remember of this game, though the final positon was black king on e6, white king on c5, and white pawn was on a5.}
