1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I have a collection of games which seem to proove the fact that 2 pieces are better than one rook, even though the side that has the rook may also have a pawn or two for these pieces.  This is Example No.1.  I kick off with 1.e4.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {2. ...... Nf6 - this is the Petrov's Defense, a counter-attack against the e4 pawn.} 3. Nxe5 Qe7 {3. ...... Qe7 - skewers my knight against my e4 pawn and winning it very soon.} 4. d4 {4. d4 - supports e5 knight and opens up a diagonal for Fou Lenoir.} Nc6 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3 - development.} Nxe5 6. dxe5 Qxe5 {6. ........ Qxe5 - after a knight trade on e5 black has now restored material equality.} 7. f4 Qe6 8. Qd4 {8. Qd4 - Glenda decides to come out to play, ah, she still has to defend something though, the pawn on e4!} d6 9. Be2 Be7 10. O-O O-O {10. ....... 0-0 - some normal development here.} 11. Bf3 {11. Bf3 - Fou Leblanc decides to lend more support to my e4 pawn.} c6 12. Qe3 Ng4 13. Bxg4 Qxg4 {13. ........ Qxg4 - after Glenda decides to go back indoors there follows a B for N trade.  Glenda moves to f3 to try to drive back the Wicked Witch of the West.  The Witch flies back to d7. } 14. Qf3 Qd7 15. Bd2 {15. Bd2 - Fou Lenoir finally emerges and the rooks are connected.} Qc7 16. Kh1 {16. Kh1 - Henry moves into the corner because he does not want to see the Witch on b3!  He likes her not!} Be6 17. b3 Rad8 18. Ne2 d5 19. exd5 Bxd5 {19. ........ Bxd5 - after a little bit of piece moving there is a pawn trade.} 20. Qe3 Rfe8 21. Bc3 {21. Bc3 - Fou Lenoir controls the long diagonal, I consider moving Glenda to g3 next move.} Bf6 22. Qf2 {22. Qf2 - Glenda had to sidestep a discovery but now a combo from my opponent leads to the 2 piece for rook imbalance - hence the title of this annotation.} Rxe2 23. Qxe2 Bxc3 24. Rad1 {24. Rad1 - my queen rook centralises but that bishop pair do look ominous.} Bf6 25. Rd3 b5 26. Qd2 a6 27. c3 {27. c3 - trying to shut off part of the enemy dsb's long diagonal.} a5 28. Rd1 Re8 29. Re3 Rxe3 30. Qxe3 {30. Qxe3 - rook trade, but those 2 enemy bishops still look ominous.} Qb8 31. Re1 h6 32. Qe8+ Qxe8 33. Rxe8+ {33. Rxe8+ - queen trade.} Kh7 34. Re3 {34. Re3 - must defend the c3 pawn.} Kg6 35. Kg1 b4 36. Rg3+ {36. Rg3+ - spite check.} Kf5 37. cxb4 axb4 {37. ....... axb4 - pawn trade.} 38. Rd3 Kxf4 39. g3+ {39. g3+ - after I lose a pawn, another spite check.} Ke4 40. Rd1 Bd4+ 41. Kf1 Ke5 {41. ....... Ke5 - white is very tied up now.} 42. Rc1 f5 43. Re1+ Be4 44. Ke2 {44. Ke2 - I am very close to being in a zugzwang.} g5 45. Rc1 c5 46. Kd2 Bc3+ {46. ...... Bc3+ - tightens the screw.} 47. Ke3 f4+ 48. gxf4+ gxf4+ {48. ........ gxf4+ pawn trade.} 49. Ke2 f3+ 50. Kd1 f2 {50. ...... f2 - black is very close to getting a queen.  Henry moves to e2 to stop it.} 51. Ke2 Bd4 52. Kf1 {52. Kf1 - the only move to avoid immediate loss but Bd3+ forces Henry to g2 and the pawn will crown forcing me to give up my rook.  I therefore resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Hope you've enjoyed this, part 2 will be coming up very shortly.} Bd3+ {}
