1. d4 {A staple first move, elegant in its execution but devastating in its repercussions. } d5 {My opponent begins with a mistake! Early on! Frankly, I expected he/she/it would be better than this - their poorly-dealt move has clearly given me an early advantage. } 2. e4 {Good move here. Splendid, in fact. } dxe4 {Another mistake! My Chekhovs Left Flank Sacrifice opening is paying off...} 3. Bb5+ c6 {Just as planned. } 4. Qg4 {He didn't expect THAT, did he? Now who's laughing?} Bxg4 {Me, of course! My plan is all coming together...} 5. Kd2 {Skillful move here. } cxb5 {Silly silly silly. } 6. Kc3 {My king, moving into the offense. } Nc6 {A hopeless endeavor with no real meaning. Sad. What a waste. } 7. Bg5 Qxd4+ {Very bad. } 8. Kb3 {Beautifully timed sliding tackle... I mean move. } Qc4+ {Very silly. He doesn't checkmate me on h56. } 9. Ka3 {Safe from his onslaught. Skilled and deadly. } Qa4# {A fluke that ultimately tipped a close match that I dominated. }
