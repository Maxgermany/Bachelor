[Opening "Sicilian (B28), O'Kelly variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 a6 {At the start, my opponent plays an interesting O'Kelly variation of the Sicilian. At first I did not know what to do, facing this odd-looking move.} 3. Nc3 d6 4. d4 {I started to attack the center, seeing that my opponent is content to sit back.} cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6. Be3 Nf6 {At this position, my opponent transposes from the O'Kelly to the Schevenigen, which a main  characteristic is the buffer made ny the d6 and e6 pawns. I assumed that my opponent is playing defensive here.} 7. f4 Qa5 {Until here, my opponent summoned his queen on an attack when he has not developed all his pieces. Suddenly, my opponent changed from a defensive position to an aggressive position.} 8. Nb3 {I decided to sit back and find out what he is doing.} Qb4 9. Bd3 d5 10. a3 Qe7 11. e5 Nfd7 12. O-O {When I have retreated my opponent's queen and knight to a defensive position, I was content to castle my king.} Qd8 13. Qg4 g6 14. Ne2 Be7 15. Ng3 {I piled up my pieces on the kingside for an attack...} O-O 16. c4 {I attacked the queenside instead of the kingside. What I wanted to do is to constantly shift my opponent's attention on both sides of the board. I was not sure how this would work out, but I did it anyway.} dxc4 17. Bxc4 Nc6 18. h4 {I made a mistake on my part by leaving the h-pawn hanging. This would set my opponent's dark-squared bishop active on the kingside and gaining material.} Bxh4 19. Nh5 {The g6-pawn is pinned, so my knight is safe.} Be7 20. Nd4 {Now I switched my attack to the queenside again.} Nb6 21. Nxc6 bxc6 22. Ba2 Kh8 23. Bxb6 {I made a blunder by taking the knight. I was thinking of retreating my h5 knight after attacking my opponent;s queen, but...} Qxb6+ {I did not realise that this was a check! I am going to go down a piece.} 24. Kh2 gxh5 25. Qxh5 Qxb2 {I started to frenzy here, not knowing how to salvage the situation.} 26. Rfb1 Qd4 27. Qg4 {I am forced to defend from here. My attack just know has stopped, leaving me in a difficult situation.} Rg8 28. Qf3 Bd7 29. Rbd1 Qb2 30. Rxd7 Bxa3 {I was surprised that my opponent did not take his chances and took the pawn instead of the rook.} 31. Rxf7 Raf8 {Again, my opponent missed his chances...} 32. Rb1 {I slided my rook away...} Qxa2 33. Rbb7 {Immediately, I took control of the 7th rank, a rank where a rook's attack is at its zenith. Also, I am preparing to land a checkmate on my opponent's king.} Rxf7 34. Rxf7 c5 {A huge mistake from my opponent. He blocks the bishop's diagonal, which originally helped in preventing a checkmate or draw, even lancing me in a losing position.} 35. Qh3 {I took my chances and threaten checkmate on h7.} Qc2 {He protects the h7 square. Find a good move at this position.} 36. f5 {It's f5! This move blocks the queen's protection to h7. This move basically seals a draw for me. If my opponent takes this pawn with his queen, I can take out his queen with my rook and then take outhis bishop with my queen, leaving me with an advantageous position.} exf5 {A complete blunder which seals my win and his loss.} 37. Qxh7# {Checkmate. This game was long, and I struggled along the whole game, especially when I made a mistake at move 23. I thought I was going to lose, but my opponent made a critical blunder at the end and let his advantageous position go to waste. This marks the importance of every move. One blunder made me think I was loosing, one blunder made my opponent lose.}
