1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nc6 4. Ngf3 Nf6 5. e5 Nd7 6. c3 f6 7. exf6 Qxf6 8. Nb3 e5 9. dxe5 Ndxe5 10. Nxe5 Qxe5+ {Nxe5 might be a good idea instead of Qxe5.   It's tougher to find activity for the knight on the queenside, and the knight blocks Black's c-pawn.} 11. Be3 Bd6 12. g3 {This is a mistake and gives Black better play than he should have.   } Qe4 13. Rg1 Bg4 14. Nd2 Qe6 15. Be2 Bxe2 16. Qxe2 O-O 17. Nb3 Ne5 18. Nd4 Qg6 19. O-O-O a6 {Maybe 19...c6 is better to defend d5. I'm looking to play c5 of course - to dislodge White's knight and possibly play Nf3. } 20. h4 c5 21. Nc2 Nf3 22. Rgh1 Qe4 23. Qd3 Qxd3 24. Rxd3 d4 25. cxd4 c4 26. Rdd1 Rae8 27. Ne1 Bxg3 28. Nxf3 Rxf3 29. Rh3 {I missed this.    Nice move....} Rexe3 30. fxe3 Rxe3 31. d5 Rf3 {I'm hoping to win a rook with 32...Bf4+, but White's passed d-pawn is much too fast.  It will either promote, or Black will have to give up a bishop or rook to stop it. I don't know how I could have played this move, to be honest.  Very careless  31...Rf3 really is a ridiculous move.    You have to realize the strength of a passed pawn and keep it in mind at all times.  31...Bf4 is better, but Black still seems to be in hot water.  ie) 31...Bf4 32.Rxf3 Bxf3+ 33.Kc2 and maybe 33...Bc5 34.d6 Kf7...  White may have better options than advancing this pawn right away.   I'm not sure.  } 32. Rxg3 Rf7 33. d6 {the game went on for a few more moves.    rooks were traded off, and Black soon resigned.
