1. e4 {Here's a League game where, again, I've followed Ion's advice and avoided swapping off at the end, when it's a race to mate and I win by one move :-)} c5 {My faithful Sicilian again.} 2. Bc4 {and White adopts the fashionable (on Gameknot at any rate) 2. Bc4} e6 3. Nf3 d5 {immediately challenging in the centre} 4. exd5 exd5 5. Bb5+ {sidestepping with the equally popular Bb5 } Nd7 6. O-O {White appears to be well ahead in development, as is often the case early in the Sicilian.} Ngf6 7. Re1+ Be7 8. Nc3 O-O {but Black has equalised now since White's d-pawn is still at home.} 9. Bxd7 Bxd7 10. d3 Re8 11. Bg5 h6 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 {Now Black has the advantage of the Bishop Pair on a  relatively open board.  Can he use it?} 13. Nxd5 {! Snapping up the loose pawn and threatening to disrupt Black's kingside} Bc6 14. Nxf6+ {? Better was 14. Rxe8  when 14... Qxe8 allows 15. Nxf6 , when Black has to retake with the g-pawn.  Otherwise 14. ...Bxe8 puts Black's bishop on a bad square and the good bishop falls with 15. Nxf6 } Qxf6 15. c3 Rad8 16. d4 {? Better was 16. Rxe8  (again), when Black can't divert White's attention from the d-file.  White also has to watch out for his N on f3.  He shouldn't allow Black to give him doubled f-pawns.} Rxe1+ 17. Qxe1 Bxf3 18. gxf3 cxd4 19. cxd4 Rxd4 {Now material is even but White has a structural weakness.  Is this enough to give Black victory?} 20. Qc3 {Defends the f-pawn, pins the R against the Q (if Black allowed White to capture on f6, he would return the compliment of the doubled f-pawns, unless, of course he used his R to defend the Q) and threatens Qc8 , winning the b-pawn: looks good.} Qg6+ {side-stepping with check on the open file} 21. Kf1 Rd3 {forking Q and p} 22. Qc2 {pinning the R again!} Qf5 {doubling the attack on the weak f-pawn} 23. Ke1 Qxf3 {converting the structural advantage into a material one.  Would this be enough to justify allowing swapping off yet? } 24. Qe2 {Here, I tried to make 24...Qh1  work but couldn't.  I wanted to avoid a situation where I was chasing his pawns on his 2nd rank while he was doing the same to mine on mine.  His K was slightly better placed to defend than mine.} Qf5 {So I retreated again: he who runs away lives to fight another day!} 25. Rc1 Rd7 {defending my second rank to give my Q time to harrass his.} 26. Qc2 Qe6+ 27. Qe2 Qd5 28. Rc8+ Kh7 29. Qc2+ g6 30. Qc3 {threatening Q/R-h8   but what has White overlooked?} Qd1# {Yep :-)}
