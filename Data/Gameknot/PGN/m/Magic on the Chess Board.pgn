1. Nf3 {I have prepared an interesting idea (see my 9th move) especially for this game, primarily to surprise my opponent.} Nf6 2. c4 {As a child, I used to be an 1.e4 player, then at the age of 10, I basically switched to 1.d4. In this game I chose the English, which is opening I only rarely employed in my career.} e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. a3 Bxc3 6. Qxc3 {I found a good number of games of Maia's in the database with this position, so far everything was going according to my plans.} c5 7. b4 b6 8. Bb2 d6 {A smart move to prepare e6–e5, which effectively neutralizes the battery of Bishop and Queen along the a1–h8 diagonal. If 8...Bb7 9.g4 works well.} 9. g4 {! This new idea was the whole reason, why I chose this opening setup. This concept is certainly an exception from the rules, which is: castle early and keep your King safe. After my last move it will be clear that it would not be safe to castle to either side of the board, as both b4 and g4 has already been played.  The standard move is 9.g3 instead.} Bb7 {Black could not play immediately 9...e5?!, as then White has 10.Nxe5! dxe5? 11.Bg2 trapping the Rook in the corner.} 10. g5 {Now that the Knight is attacked, it has move, and it can only move to squares that hold on to the g7 Pawn to avoid the checkmate.} Nh5 {The best move. Also after 10...Ne8 I planned also 11.Rg1.} 11. Rg1 {The natural follow up of my last two moves. It was important to move my Rook out of the pin and to liberate my Knight.} e5 {! Again the best defense. At this point I started having some doubts about my game plan. But as Maia was spending considerable amount of time so far, I was hoping that eventually she will make some inaccuracies/mistakes.} 12. Bh3 {With this move, I pretty much completed development, except for my King being stuck in the middle and my Rooks not connected.} Nf4 {I was a lot more worried about 12...f5!? 13.gxf6 Qxf6.} 13. Bf5 {The tactic with 13.Nxe5 dxe5 14.Qxe5 did not work here because of the tricky 14…Nd3+! 15.exd3 Re8 counterpunch. The key moment of the game. Maia spent a lot of time here, but fell into my trap, due to a miscalculation.} g6 {? Maia did not miss my upcoming combination, just misevaluated the position at the end of a key variation. 13...Nc6 was the best alternative. If 13...Nd7 I was going to play 14.Rg4 threatening 15.Rxf4.} 14. Nxe5 {!! At first it seems like a typical combination the open up the long diagonal. However, it is much trickier than it looks.} Nxe2 {This is what Maia was hoping for, she made this response rather quickly. Some other interesting variations were: 14...gxf5 15.Nc6 and White is winning. 14...dxe5 15.Qxe5 f6 (if 15...Ng2+ 16.Rxg2) 16.Qxf4 gxf5 17.gxf6+ Kf7 (17...Kh8 18.f7+) 18.Rg7+ Ke8 19.Qe5. 14...Re8 15.Nxf7 and Black is lost. 14...Qe8 When I first noticed this defensive idea, I almost gave up on the Knight sacrifice altogether, as I could not move my Knight from e5 due to the checkmate on e2. Luckily I found an elegant counter blow with 15.Be4!!. and after15...Bxe4 16.Ng4! is most accurate and if 16...Nd3+ 17.Qxd3! Bxd3 18.Nh6 checkmate. Actually, the relatively best defense was 14...Qe7! and after 15.Be4!! dxe5 (If 15...Bxe4 White wins after 16.Nc6! Nd3+ 17.Kf1!) 16.Bxb7 Nxe2! (After 16...Qxb7 17.Qxe5 f6 18.Qxf4+ White has a winning advantage.) 17.Kxe2 Qxb7 18.Qxe5 f6 19.Qe6+ Rf7 20.gxf6. White is two Pawns up, but Black still has some hope to save the game. The idea behind Black's "counter-sacrifice" (with 14…Nxe2) is, that if now 15.Kxe2 dxe5 and I could not take 16.Qxe5?? due to the pin with 16...Re8.} 15. Nxf7 {!! Not enough that my Queen, Rook and Bishop was already hanging, this move just puts the Knight also under attack.} Nxc3 {If 15...Kxf7 White wins quickly with 16.Qg7+ Ke8 17.Bf6 Rf7 18.Qg8+ Rf8 19.Qe6+.} 16. Nh6+ {! The key point of the entire combination! But not 16.Nxd8?? Rxd8 17.Be6+ Kf8 18.Bxc3 Re8 and Black wins!} Kg7 17. Bxc3+ Rf6 18. Bxf6+ Qxf6 19. gxf6+ Kxh6 {My opponent calculated this far, only thinking that her Rook is still on the board on f8 and that she is up a piece. Here White has a clearly winning position (being up an exchange and a Pawn). Unfortunately, I forgot the famous advice: when you see a good move, look for a better one!  Instead I played the natural } 20. Be6 {and missing the appropriate finish to this otherwise elegant game I was short on time so I was not able to spot the best move 20.Rb1! and Black helpless against the Rook swinging over to h3 via the third rank. 20...gxf5 (20...Bf3 21.Rb3 Bh5 22.Be4) 21.Rb3 and checkmating with Rh3 next.} Nc6 21. Bd5 Rf8 22. f7 Nd8 23. Bxb7 Nxb7 24. Rg3 Rxf7 25. Re3 Nd8 26. b5 Rf4 27. d3 d5 28. Re7 dxc4 29. dxc4 Nf7 {If 29...Rxc4? White can force the exchange of Rooks with 30.Rd1 Rd4 31.Rxd4 cxd4 32.Rxa7 with an easy win.} 30. Rd1 Ng5 31. Rxa7 Rxc4 32. Ra6 Rc2 33. Rxb6 c4 34. a4 Ra2 35. Ra6 Nf3+ 36. Kf1 Nd2+ {If 36...Nxh2+ 37.Kg2 Ng4 38.Rd4} 37. Rxd2 {! Of course moving the King out of the check to the g file is fine two, but this simplifying combination seemed simpler to me.} Rxd2 38. Rc6 Rc2 39. b6 {and Black resigned as the connected passed Pawns on the a and b files are unstoppable.}
