[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {martineli was rated 1889 and I wanted to play solidly...it was a blitz game} d5 2. Nf3 {i was hoping to transpose into a london system-type setup} Bg4 {here i should have played e3 I believe.  instead, i developed the "london bishop" which would play a significant role as the game went...} 3. Bf4 Bxf3 4. gxf3 {i was thinking bh3 looked very nice} e6 5. Nd2 {ideas of the c4 break} h6 6. Bh3 {a bad blunder; i was too enamored of how nice the bishop would be parked on h3} Nc6 {here again i miss the chance to ward off the nasty qh4} 7. c3 Qh4 8. Bxc7 {i figured that since I was going to drop material, i needed some kind of sudden, aggressive attack if i was to have any chance of a sporting game} Qxh3 9. Qb3 b6 10. Qb5 {with obvious threats of qxc6} Nge7 11. Qa6 {ideas of qb7 or bxb6} e5 12. Bxb6 {...perhaps qb7 was stronger} Qc8 {down by about a pawn, I am happy to get the queens off.} 13. Qxc8+ Nxc8 14. Bc7 exd4 15. cxd4 Nxd4 16. Kd1 {awkward but the only way to defend both e2 and c2} Nb5 17. Bf4 Bd6 18. Bxd6 {if bishop e3 then d4} Ncxd6 19. Rc1 O-O 20. Rc5 {rc6 may have been stronger} d4 21. Rg1 Rac8 22. Rd5 {ideas of a4} a6 23. a4 Rfd8 {he thought for a long while prior to this move.  there may have been a better continuation but i was going to be happy to equalize} 24. axb5 axb5 25. Rg4 Nc4 26. Rxd8+ Rxd8 27. Nxc4 bxc4 {white has equalized and both sides are even in material in this pawn-and-rook ending.} 28. Kc2 {his pawns looked menacing and i wanted to encourage d3+, afterwards picking up the c pawn} d3+ 29. exd3 cxd3+ 30. Kd2 g5 {a possible mistake? rb8 looked more threatening...} 31. Rb4 Kg7 32. Rb3 Rd4 33. Rxd3 Rh4 34. Ke2 {already the b-pawn is looking like a runner...} Rxh2 35. b4 Rh4 36. Rb3 Rc4 37. Kd3 Rc6 38. b5 Rb6 39. Kc4 h5 40. Kc5 Rb8 41. b6 Rc8+ 42. Kd6 h4 43. b7 Rb8 44. Kc7 Rxb7+ 45. Rxb7 {perhaps capturing with my king would have been better.  white is material up in the endgame, but i wasn't sure if i could convert the win (nor was he...)} Kg6 46. Kd6 f6 47. Rb1 f5 48. Rg1 Kh5 49. Ke5 {i think this is a strong move.  black is lost} f4 50. Kf5 {the final move of the game, threatening rxg5+.  thus concluded my greatest upset victory.}
