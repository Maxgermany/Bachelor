1. d4 {In this game black plays passively and pays the price.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bh4 {Immediately before the game I had demonstrated my win against David Jameson. I was wondering how long he would repeat moves for! http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/colwyn-bay-v-malpas-oswestry-chester-league?gm=62100} Bd6 {This is different! Jameson had taken on c4 instead. Bd6 is very unusual though - it normally goes to e7 or b4 here.} 7. e3 {My very good friend Peter Lovatt, when I showed him the game suggested e2-e4 instead of this move. I was glad to see that e2-e4 had not been played in any of the previous games where this position arose. What do you think dear reader? Is e2-e4 superior to e2-e3. } Nbd7 {So he develops.} 8. cxd5 {I decide to exchange - rather than develop my bishop from f1 and then he can gain a tempo with dxc4. Another point of course in this position, black can only recapture with a pawn, and not his Nf6. If he takes back with the e pawn, as in the game, there is a possibility of a white minority attack. http://www.expert-chess-strategies.com/minority-attack.html Another consideration was that with his Nb8 already committed to d7, if he takes back with the c pawn, that knight ca't be developed immediately to c6. Of course, taking back with the c pawn and his Bc8 has problems in developing. I was very surprised that in none of the games on Gameknot, on the Gameknot database, was 8. cxd5 played, although ti was played in some of the games on the World Databse} exd5 {He took back this way.} 9. Bd3 {Preventing his knight coming to e4 in some variations, and preparing to castle.} O-O {He castles.} 10. O-O {I castle.} Re8 {He puts his Rf8 onto its most logical square, controlling the semi-open e file. In chess, a half-open file (or semi-open file) is a file with only pawns of one color. The half-open file can provide a line of attack for a player's rook or queen. A half-open file is exploited by the player with no pawns on it.} 11. Qc2 {I get my rooks connected and add another piece to the key square e4.} Nf8 {he move the knight to prepare the development of his Bc8.} 12. Rae1 {I change my mind about an immediate minority attack. I am planning Nd2 followed by f3 and e4 to expand in the centre.} Be7 {Rather an acknowledgement that his bishop would have been better developed to e7 in the first place. I tend to think that this move is a waste of a tempo and it would have been better for him to develop his Bc8.} 13. Ne5 {This is the logical reply, putting the knight on an aggressive square.} Nh5 {Black is seeking to ease the pressure with exchanges, but the knight is rather out on a limb here. After 13. Ne5 I can only find one game in my opening databases with this position, http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=20476007&mv=24&rnd=0.006532949289570045 colo1889 (1907) vs. john_wr (1871). I have actually met John face to face! Anyway he chose Be6 instead, and I think that move is better. Incidentally Gameknot post-game computer analysis doesn't give Be6 as a mistake, suggesting it was a reasonable move, maybe even the best. I was also looking at Ng4 for him, with a similar idea of exchanging pieces.} 14. Bxe7 {So I take his bishop. But really I am getting rid of his good bishop and my bad bishop.} Rxe7 {I was rather expecting him to recapture with his queen.} 15. f4 {So I anchor my knight to e5. } Nf6 {He prepares to exchange my knight.} 16. b4 {and the long-awaited minority attack starts.} Nf6d7 {He continues with his plan.} 17. b5 {and me with mine.} Nxe5 {He takes.} 18. fxe5 {I take back.} Bd7 {Finally the bishop comes out.} 19. bxc6 {I take.} bxc6 {I can't help thinking that although white has a slight edge anyway, it would have been better to take back with the bishop.} 20. Na4 {Heading for c5} Rc8 {Not quite sure of the point of this move.} 21. Nc5 {Knight hops in.} Ne6 {He challenges my knight.} 22. Reb1 {I grab the open file.} Nxc5 {He takes.} 23. Qxc5 {I take back, attacking h7.} Be8 {Again, very passive! Be6 looks better.} 24. Ba6 {Of course, he would love to play Rb8, but it just loses a rook - I exchange rooks and then take his rook on e7.} Rcc7 {So he moves it here instead.} 25. Rb3 {Preparing to double rooks on the b file and invade on b8. Black can't stop this. I also protect e3 just in case he tries to break with f6.} Red7 {He has a plan to exchange queens.} 26. Rfb1 {I double.} Qe7 {He offers an exchange of queens.} 27. Rb3b8 {So the rook finally reaches b8. Now if he takes my queen, I have a zwischenzug - I take his bishop with check before recapturing the queen and end up a bishop up. The zwischenzug (German: pronounced [ˈtsvɪʃənˌtsuːk] "intermediate move") is a chess tactic in which a player, instead of playing the expected move (commonly a recapture of the capturer of a piece that the opponent has just captured) first interposes another move, posing an immediate threat that the opponent must answer, then plays the expected move. This is a good example. } Kf8 {But now he really is threatening to exchange queens.} 28. Qc2 {So I threaten to invade on h7.} g6 {He prevents this.} 29. Rf1 {And now I have a pin on the f file, so I am threatening Qxg6. In chess, a pin is a situation brought on by an attacking piece in which a defending piece cannot move without exposing a more valuable defending piece on its other side to capture by the attacking piece. "To pin" refers to the action of the attacking piece inducing the pin, and the defending piece so restricted is described as pinned. This is a good example. Were it was white's move now I could play Qxg6 and black can't take my queen with his pawn on f7 as he would be moving into check because of my Rf1.} Kg7 {So he breaks the pin.} 30. Qf2 {More pressure on the f file. More importantly he can't play 30....Rd8 neutralising my rook, as I have 31. Qf6+ where 31....Qxf6 is met by exf6+ and he loses the Rd8, 31... Kf8 is met by Qh8# and Kg8 or h7 is met with me exchanging queens and winning the Rd8. } Kf8 {So he moves back again.} 31. Bd3 {I threaten Bxg6 now.} Qg5 {Queen comes back out to g4, but I think Kg7 prolongs the game more.} 32. h4 {I attack the queen.} Qg4 {Queen wants to keep on the g pawn. OK, stop and find white's best move.} 33. Qf6 {Did you find it? The threat of Qh8 followed by QxBe8 mate is irresistible. http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=181618  Many thanks for reading.
