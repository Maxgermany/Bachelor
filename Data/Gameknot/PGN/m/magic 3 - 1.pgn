1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The Advance variation against the French Defense.} c5 4. Qg4 {I had just read about this move Qh4 but never played against it. There are some real problems for White in this line.} cxd4 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 Qc7 7. Qg3 Nb4 8. Nxd4 Nxd3+ 9. Qxd3 Qxe5+ {A pawn was lost but he avoided other problems---for the moment.} 10. Be3 Bd7 11. Nc3 Nf6 12. O-O-O Be7 13. f4 Qc7 14. Nf3 Bb4 15. Bd4 {Bd4? loses another pawn.} Qxf4+ 16. Kb1 O-O 17. Bxf6 {Bxf6? is another poor move weakening the black squares.} Qxf6 18. Rhf1 Bxc3 {Bxc3! } 19. bxc3 Rac8 {Doubled isolated pawns couldn't be avoided. The busted up castled position is about to lose the game for White.} 20. Nd4 Qe7 21. h4 Rc4 22. Nf3 Rfc8 23. Ng5 {Ng5 is worth a try but now we have...} f5 {f5 is a valuable resource.} 24. g4 Rc4xc3 25. Qd4 Rc8c4 {Now forced moves will tell the story..} 26. Qe5 Qb4+ 27. Ka1 Rc3xc2 28. Rdb1 Rxa2+ 29. Kxa2 Qa4+ 30. Kb2 Qc2+ 31. Ka3 Ra4# {The White king did not have an adequate defense and exchanging off the Bishop earlier proved to be the deciding factors.}
