1. e4 {An exciting game from Gameknot's 80th tournament. After Black launches an assault on White very early on, White is able to storm back after a couple of errors in Black's attack gives White the advantage in position and material... though he soon gives up that material advantage in favour of what he hoped to be a winning positional strike. It doesn't quite work out that way... well, it shouldn't have worked out that way, but it did! } c5 {http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15699296&rnd=0.2643783134408295 <-- GK analysis } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e6 {Normal Sicilian play so far, but still, this move (though book according to analysis) is a new one for me } 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. f4 {A standard Sicilian move from White - an early kingside pawn advancement is in order here! } d6 7. Bc4 Be7 8. Be3 O-O {Again, all standard stuff. I was feeling a little reckless at this point though, and decided to try something new... } 9. g4 {? It will most definitely not be a move that I'll play again, though! White goes for a kingside pawn storm that comes way too early, and Black is quick to exploit that! } Nxd4 {But first, the exchange! } 10. Bxd4 e5 {! The key move - as well as hitting the d4 bishop, it discovers a second attacker on the pawn that I have just pushed forward. } 11. fxe5 {To avoid losing a pawn, the following sequence is pretty much forced. } dxe5 12. Bxe5 Nxg4 {...but it seriously exposes White's position! } 13. Qxd8 {White recognises that he's exposed and exchanges queens - I wonder whether Bg3 was better, followed by Qd3 and 0-0-0 - probably not, since that isn't taking into account what Black's moves would be! } Rxd8 {Since the king would move over a checked square, castling seems even more unlikely now! } 14. Bf4 {The bishop was threatened, but as I mentioned earlier, it might have been better to move it back to the g3 square... } Bh4+ {...because of this check! } 15. Ke2 {I don't really know why I didn't block the check now, but GK analysis didn't see anything wrong with this move! } Nf2 {Attacking the rook... } 16. Rhg1 {?! ...and moving away from the danger - but to the wrong square? Rf1 was preferred with analysis due to Nh3 - a double attack on the rook and bishop - and Black keeps up the pressure! } Bg4+ {Black plays this check instead, and though it looks perfectly natural apparently it threw away the advantage that Black had... } 17. Ke3 {...leading to GK analysis judging this position to have equal chances for both sides! (well, 0.08 to White but that's negligible!) That's pretty crazy given the Black pieces invading kingside! } Bh5 {Not really sure what this was actually meant to do, but it provides White with a great opportunity to rid my weak kingside of invading pieces... } 18. Bg5 {...like this! By forking the rook and the undefended bishop, Bxg4+, followed by a knight check on g4 or d1 is pretty much forced! } Ng4+ {? Wrong order! This allows a rook exchange for two pieces - materially advantageous for White! } 19. Rxg4 Bxg4 20. Bxh4 {As well as gaining the material advantage, White now has the bishop pair on the open board - the advantage is definitely his! } Rd6 {Black has control of the d-file, so he looks to make the most of that advantage } 21. Rg1 {Meanwhile,White issues a threat to the g4 bishop. The only realistic squares for the bishop is e6, d7 and c8, the last two interfering with rook communication.  } h5 {Black opts to defend the bishop... } 22. Rf1 {...so White targets f7 instead! } Be6 {Black doesn't want to assign his rook to defensive duties, and the pawn is pinned so it can't move, so Black chooses the bishop block... } 23. Bxe6 {...and White exchanges. I didn't really want to give up the bishop pair, but there were three reasons for this; 1) I was ahead in material 2) any other square for the bishop didn't look like a good square in my view - but perhaps that's just me! 3) If the bishop moved, I would have to do something about my knight being confined to protecting a2 - just a minor reason though because of b3. } Rxe6 24. Nd5 {knight centralisation... } Rae8 {...and Black piles on the pressure on my isolated e4 pawn! } 25. Rf4 {Forced [White doesn't want to waste tempo by retreating the knight to the original square]. A rook having to defend along a row like this looks pretty ugly beyond the second rank, especially when there are only two squares on said row, but it's a solid defence thanks to my h4 bishop defending g5 } Rd6 {Black switches his attention to my knight, which is currently in danger due to the pin on e4... } 26. Be7 {!? I was feeling a little reckless with this move! :) White is aware that he's giving back the material he won earlier but also realises that he gets a passed pawn out of it! Sure, Black does too on the f file but White's passed pawn is more advanced! } Rxd5 {Black follows through with getting his material back with the same 'rook for two pieces' trick that I used earlier! } 27. exd5 Rxe7+ 28. Kf2 {There were two reasons behind this king move;  1) The king is set to halt any advance by the f-pawn should Black want to do something with it 2) White doesn't want a rook intrusion on the second rank } g6 {Black bolsters his h5 pawn - just in case! } 29. c4 {White wants support for the d-pawn, but the rook alone won't do that - this is the first step of a fairly long sequence that makes the pawn all the more powerful! } Kf8 {While I do that, Black looks to get his king in the action! } 30. c5 Ke8 31. a4 {Can you see where the a-pawn is headed? :) } f5 {Black relieves the king and rook of protective duties on f7. } 32. a5 Kd7 33. a6 {! Completing White's plan - now no matter what Black does here, White gets two connected passed pawns on the c and d files! } bxa6 {Or 33...b6 34.c6+ } 34. Ra4 {I was focusing on how best to advance either my c pawn or d pawn (perhaps not the best plan to begin with) but, finding no good way to do that, tried something different instead. There's no way to defend a6... } Re5 {! So Black creates a counter-threat! White's e5 pawn has more value than the a6 pawn! } 35. c6+ {?! White plans to defend d4, of course, but instead pushes forward with tempo. Is it the right thing to do? According to GK analysis, it wasn't! } Kc7 {If Kd6, then White would move his rook to c4 with the very real threat of c7. This king move keeps my pawns in check. } 36. Rd4 Kd6 37. h4 {White could have tried Rc5 now, but instead he decides to defend a little kingside. This position according to analysis is pretty much drawn, with neither side having an effective use for their pawns } a5 38. b3 {Preventing a push to a4 - Black only has a6 before he is out of valid pawn moves! } Re8 {Rook moves are okay, though! } 39. Kf3 {White is heading for g6, his king being the most active piece right now } Kc5 {Black moves his own king, chasing away my rook. He uses the rook diversion a little later on... } 40. Rd3 Kd6 41. Kf4 Re4+ {...like this! } 42. Kg3 {White protects the h-pawn - I could have played Kg5 instead of this, though, not fearing Black's next move } Rg4+ {Black checks again with his rook... } 43. Kh3 {In this position, Black has one forced move to stay in the game... } a4 {?? And this isn't it! Black looks to create a passed pawn on the a-file, creating some counterplay of his own, but greatly underestimates the strength that my passed pawns have! Re4 was the only move for Black here! } 44. Rc3 {! White's c-pawn is going to promote, and there is nothing Black can do to stop it! } axb3 {? Black is lost anyway, but this makes things easier for me - 44...Re4 45.c7 Re8 46.c8=Q Rxc8 47.Rxc8 is the only way to go, though White is winning after that! Black promotes a queen with this line... } 45. c7 b2 46. c8=Q b1=Q {...and if it was his turn to move, then Qh1# would win. However... } 47. Qe6# {White has an equally destructive move! It is a little funny how the game ends with queens on the board when they had been absent since move 13! :) }
