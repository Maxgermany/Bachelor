[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23)"]

1. e4 {White plays aggressively with 1. e4} e5 {Black mirrors White's image.} 2. Bc4 {This usually means White is attempting to pull off a quick Scholar's mate.} Nc6 {Inviting White to play Qf3.} 3. Qf3 {If chess were that easy, it wouldn't be so popular.} Qf6 {Black has at least equality.} 4. c3 {Preventing Nd4, but hinder's the development of White's b1 knight.} Bc5 {Black is better.} 5. d3 {What else?} b6 {Preparing to fianchetto the light-square bishop.} 6. h4 {Threatening Bg5} h6 {This stalls Bg5 for a couple of moves.} 7. g4 {White is still playing for Bg5, which does not even give White any compensation.} Bb7 8. g5 hxg5 9. Bxg5 {Okay, so White finally gets to play Bg5.} Qxf3 10. Nxf3 f6 11. Bd2 {White's dark-square bishop is now "bad."} Nh6 {Threatening Ng4} 12. Bxh6 {White exchanges the "bad" bishop for the "good" knight, but Black gets pressure on the semi-open h-file.} Rxh6 13. Bd5 {White should complete his development first.} O-O-O 14. Bxc6 {White gives Black the bishop pair for no compensation what-so-ever.} Bxc6 15. Nbd2 Bb5 {Attacking the weak d3 pawn, but allowing the potential d4 break. However, Black would then get both the e- and h-files for counterplay.} 16. c4 {This is a blunder. White should have advanced the king in this endgame.} Bc6 17. a4 {Threatening to break through with a5} a5 {This puts a stop to all of White's prospects on the Queenside.} 18. Ke2 {Finally bringing the king into play} Rdh8 {The isolated h-pawn is weak.} 19. Nb3 {Threatening to cripple Black's pawn structure.} Bb4 {The bishop can't be harassed here.} 20. Nbd2 {Bringing the knight closer to the king-side.} Be7 {Preparing g5} 21. Rh2 {It's too late to try to double rooks. White's best try is Rg1, targeting Black's weak g7 pawn.} g5 {White is busted.} 22. Rah1 {It's no use.} g4 {Pushing White back ... now Black has a distinct advantage.} 23. Ng1 f5 {Taking advantage of the pin on the a8-h1 diagonal.} 24. h5 f4 {White is getting strangled. Bxa4 was playable, but it doesn't create any threats.} 25. b3 f3+ 26. Kf1 {White's pieces are in a traffic jam.} Bb4 27. Nb1 {BOTH White's knights have no squares.} d6 {Preparing to move the bishop to a better diagonal.} 28. Rh2h4 Bd7 {Now the reason for d6 is clear.} 29. Rh1h2 Kd8 {And the march of the King begins!} 30. Rh2h1 Ke7 {Three!} 31. Rh4h2 Kf6 {Two!} 32. Rh2h4 Kg5 {One!} 33. Rh4h2 Rh6xh5 {Zero! It's time to put White out of his misery!} 34. Rh2xh5+ Rxh5 35. Rxh5+ Kxh5 {White is now in complete Zugzwang!} 36. d4 exd4 {}
