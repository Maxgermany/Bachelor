1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {Prokofiev has converted Oistrakh's Sicilian into almost a mirror-reversed Caro-Kann.} Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 {Oistrakh has now cleared the way for castling.} 7. Be2 a6 8. Qd2 {Clearing the back row. Prokofiev has an advantage in time, as Oistrakh has yet to complete his development.} Ng4 9. Bxg4 Bxg4 10. f3 Bd7 11. Bh6 {Whether Oistrakh captures or guards, K-side castling will not be an option. However, the exchange eases his defensive task.} Rg8 12. Bxg7 Rxg7 13. Qh6 Kf8 {The only way to avoid loss of material.} 14. O-O-O Nc6 15. Nxc6 bxc6 16. Rhe1 Rb8 {Aiming down the half-open file at the White King's position.} 17. e5 d5 18.

Kb2 {The game slows down as both men maneuver for positional advantage.} Rg8 26. Qf4 Bd7 27. Qf6+ Qxf6 28. exf6 {With the Queens gone, a drawn-out ending looms.

Kc3 c5 {Oistrakh begins surging his own Pawns forward on the Q-side, hoping to generate a passed Pawn.} 38. Rh7h6 d4+ 39. Kd2 Rbb6 40. Rxf6 Rxf6 {The position simplifies, increasing the chances of a draw. Oistrakh has a slight advantage with his now-freed B and advanced Q-side Pawns.} 41. Rh5 e4 42. fxe4 Bxg4 43. Rg5 Bf3 {Thrust and counterthrust.} 44. Rxc5 Bxe4 {Oistrakh gets the first passed Pawn, but it has a long way to go.} 45. Nxd4 {Prokofiev counters by obtaining his own passed Pawn.} Bg2 46. a4 Ke7 47. b4 Kd7 {Rushing his King to the defense of the Q-side.} 48. Ke3 Rd6 49. b5 Rd5 50. Rxd5+ Bxd5 51. bxa6 {Prokofiev relies on his advanced Pawns to neutralize the advantage of Oistrakh's minor exchange.} Kc7 52. Nb5+ Kb6 53. Kd4 Bg2 54. a7 Kb7 55.
