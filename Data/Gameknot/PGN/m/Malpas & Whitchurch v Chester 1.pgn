1. e4 c5 {So it starts as a Sicilian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {And we reach the usual position in the Open Sicilian.} 6. Bg5 {He plays the Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack, probably the strongest continuation, and at the moment the most popular.} e6 {We both follow the most usual continuation for a few moves.} 7. Qd2 {He prepares to castle.} a6 {This is normal.} 8. O-O-O {He castles.} Bd7 {I prepare to advance my b pawn.} 9. f3 {This is usual, giving more support to e4, although 9. f4 is even more common.} Rc8 {I continue with my queen-side operations.} 10. h4 {I think this is a bit of a wild thrust on the king-side, although it has been played before.} Be7 {So I continue to develop.} 11. Qe1 {Although the position after 10.....Be7 is on my opening databases, I can't find this queen move on them. Presumably the idea is throwing the queen over to the king-side to support a pawn advance there. I don't think it turns out particularly well for white.} h6 {So I hit his bishop.} 12. Be3 {Bishop retreats.} Nxd4 {I exchange} 13. Bxd4 {He takes back.} e5 {I hit the bishop.} 14. Be3 {Bishop drops back.} Be6 {Played with the idea of preventing him permanently occupying d5 with a piece. If he plays Nd5 I can take it. He can't take back with the rook, so he has to take with the pawn and then my weakness on d6 is shielded by his pawn on d5. They is also the chance of an attack on a2. I'm quite happy with this position for black.} 15. Kb1 {So he gives some more protection to a2} Qa5 {And my queen comes out to add to pressure on a2} 16. Bd3 {He just develops.} Rxc3 {This is a thematic exchange sacrifice. In return for the exchange, black gets the a pawn and I shatter his queen side pawns. I have enough compensation, but not more. I was also motivated because nothing else seemed very good, for instance if instead 16......d5? then 17. Nxd5 and if Qxe1 18. Nxf6 check and white ends up a pawn up. In the same way, if 16..... 0-0 then 17. Nd5! again is powerful.} 17. Qxc3 {This is the best way to take.} Bxa2+ {So I take the pawn with check.} 18. Kc1 {His king moves back towards the centre.} Qxc3 {So I take her queen and break up his pawns.} 19. bxc3 {He takes back.} Be6 {I have to retreat my bishop, before it is trapped in with c3-c4.} 20. Kd2 {This is a good, centralised place for his king.} O-O {I finally castle. I did consider Kd7, but I thought I may need d7 to manoeuvre my knight and/or bishop. } 21. Rda1 {He decides to place his rooks on the a and b files. However I did wonder if Rb1 may be stronger.} Rc8 {So I bring my rook over.} 22. Rhb1 {He takes over the b file also.} Rc7 {I protect b7.} 23. g4 {Attention now switches to the king-side.} Nd7 {I discover an attack on h4} 24. g5 {He pushes.} h5 {I try and keep the king-side closed. I also leave his a4 pawn as a possible target.} 25. Rb2 {He prepares to double on the b file} Nf8 {My knight is heading to g6 to attack h4.} 26. f4 {He threatens f4-f5 so my reply is virtually forced.} exf4 {I take.} 27. Bxf4 Ng6 {I hit his bishop and h4.} 28. Bg3 {So his bishop retreats.} f6 {I keep up my attack on the king-side. I threaten to take twice on g5. If he takes, I take back with my bishop, attacking c3.} 29. Rb6 {But he counter-attacks d6.} Ne5 {So I block his bishop attack.} 30. Bxe5 {He takes the knight.} fxe5 {If I take with the other pawn, my bishop on d6 goes.} 31. Rab1 {He attacks b7 again.} Bc8 {I protect it. I think around here I offered a draw, which he declined.} 32. Be2 {He hits h5} g6 {So I protect.} 33. c4 {I thought this was a bad idea, putting another pawn on the same colour as his Bishop - it restricts it somewhat.} Kg7 {I give extra protection to g6.} 34. Bd3 {Not sure of the point of this move, I think he just wanted to reach the time control of move 35.} Rd7 {I have a plan to boot out his rook on b6.} 35. Ke3 {He moves his king up.} Bd8 {I hit his rook.} 36. Rb6b3 {It retreats.} Rc7 {I keep the pressure on the c file.} 37. Bf1 {His bishop drops back.} Rc5 {my rook moves up.} 38. Rd1 {He hits the d pawn.} Be7 {I protect it.} 39. Rdb1 {He moves back.} Bd8 {Bishop moves back.} 40. Kd3 {King moves across.} b6 {I thought I was securing my queen-side.} 41. Rb3xb6 {I saw this after I had moved! I calculated that if I take it, he also wins the d pawn and has an advantage in the ending, while if I don't take it, he still has problems penetrating on the queen-side - or anywhere else. I was dozy for allowing this move, I should of considered it. I put it down to complacency, and I knew at this stage I only had to draw and I had convinced myself that this position was drawn, and I let my guard down. I am very lucky that the position is still drawn, but at least I made the right choice in not taking the rook.} Bc7 {So I just protect d6.} 42. Kc3 {He moves his king across.} Kf7 {I move my king over.} 43. Bd3 {He moves his bishop - I think he should have retreated his rook.} Bxb6 {So I take it.} 44. Rxb6 {He takes back.} Ke7 {I protect the d pawn.} 45. Rb1 {Rook retreats.} a5 {Passed pawns must be pushed!} 46. Rf1 {So his rook comes over.} Be6 {I get ready to protect g6 with Nf7, if his rook comes to f6.} 47. Rb1 {So he tries on this side again.} Bc8 {And my bishop stops it.} 48. Rb5 {He offers an exchange of rooks.} Bd7 {I encourage it.} 49. Rxc5 {He takes.} dxc5 {I take back.} 50. Kb3 {King comes over.} Kd6 {So does mine.} 51. c3 {He opens up another square for his bishop.} Kc7 {My king comes across.} 52. Ka3 {His goes across again.} Kb6 {My king comes up.} 53. Bc2 {He threatens Ba4} Bc6 {But this attack prevents it.} 54. Bd3 {So the bishop goes back.} Kc7 {My king goes back.} 55. Bc2 {We start to repeat.} Kb6 {I go up again.} 56. Bd3 {and a draw is agreed. A moment later we won on two, and so narrowly won the match.}
