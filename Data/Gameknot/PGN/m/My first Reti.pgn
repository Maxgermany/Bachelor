1. Nf3 {Not being familiar with this, I used the DB feature to research likely moves.} Nf6 {This is what appeared  most statistically successful for black.} 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 {white and I follow book for the next several moves} c5 4. O-O h6 5. c4 d4 6. b4 {And we're off in to new territory with white sacking a pawn.} cxb4 {I gratefully accept.} 7. a3 e6 {Revealed defense.} 8. d3 {Opening file for bishop, I suppose.} Nc6 {Black must begin to develop pieces.} 9. axb4 {White snacks on pawn, and looks a bit like a pawn storm.} Bxb4 {taking with bishop to keep two defenders on my d4 pawn.} 10. Ba3 Bxa3 {I want to be able to castle soonish, so accepting bishop trade so castling through check isn't an issue.} 11. Nxa3 {I would have taken with the rook, probably} a6 {This was fairly useless. I should have castled instead} 12. Qd2 O-O 13. Rfb1 {lining upon b file pawn.} e5 {Getting another defender on d4} 14. Nc2 {White balances out defenders on d4 square.} Bf5 {Small blunder... I leave my b2 pawn undefended.} 15. Rxb7 {and white takes} e4 {attacking knight.} 16. Nh4 {White attacks bishop} Bh7 {I retreat to h7.  In general  I like getting my bishop back this far... it tends to become invisible.  However, in this case it isn't lined up on any great targets on the long diagonal, and it has no safe square to move to.} 17. Bh1 {Another bishop waiting like a spider....I do not see that this move gains white all that much.} Qc8 {Threatening the rook.} 18. Rab1 {He fortifies} exd3 {Thinking to allow my bishop a free square, I  capture the d3 pawn-- but it also opens the diagonal for white's h1 bishop} 19. exd3 {But white must take, and I don't have a free square for the bishop after all.} a5 {a passive move.. heading down the open file.} 20. Nf3 {White takes advantage of the lull to move the knight away from an edge, and attack the d4 pawn..  but now my LS bishop has a free square or two.} Nb4 {I attack the d3 pawn.} 21. Nfxd4 {he grabs d4} Nxd3 {so I grab d3} 22. Re7 {revealing an attack on my rook!} Rb8 {Since I must move, I offer a trade.} 23. Rxb8 {and white accepts} Qxb8 24. Rb7 Qc8 25. Bf3 Ne4 {This move forces white to take the e4 knight with bishop, or lose his rook or queen.} 26. Bxe4 Bxe4 {and I take back} 27. Ra7 {White attacks the a file pawn, but I'm not worried.} Qh3 {With the threat of mate on g2, white must unlink knights.} 28. Ne3 Rb8 {moving to the open file, with threat of Rb1# and mating pattern to follow.} 29. Nb5 {White interposes, but white's knights are beginning to get overworked.  If white moves either, black has checkmate soon.} Ne5 {Moving my knight to fork king and queen with Nf3 next move.} 30. Nd4 {White moves to stop this... but knight leaves his post stopping the Rb1#} Rb1+ 31. Nd1 {Moves the other overworked knight.} Qg2# {And the queen swoops in for checkmate.  }
