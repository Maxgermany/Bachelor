[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation, Steinitz counter-gambit (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 {This is my rematch game with Joanne Stevens in the Mason Opening theme tournament.  In my white game, I won in a pawn-up endgame after a fairly long positional struggle in 40-something moves.  Here with black, I won a nice little miniature where the game sharpened early and white got fatally mauled in rather short order.} c5 {I've consistently stuck with 2. ...c5 throughout this tournament, figuring black should play this sooner or later to exert pressure in the center, so why not sooner?} 3. e3 {I wondered fleetingly if Joanne might cheekily employ the same gambit offering I essayed (3. e4!?) in our previous bout, but as she struck me as a more positionally-minded player, figured the chance was slim.} Nf6 4. c3 {Standard moves.  Because the early development of the QB in this system weakens the dark squares at home somewhat, ...Qb6 remains a thematic black move to challenge them (as well in similar opening lines of the d4/c4 complex).  Usually white replies with Qb3 and an early queen-trade ensues.  Not to Nosferatu's taste.  Too vegetarian.} Nc6 5. Nd2 {The trendy way to play the London System these days seems to delay the development of the KN as long as sensibly possible, so long as the e5 square is adequately covered.} g6 {!? In my first black game in this tournament, I played 5. ...e6, the boilerplate semi-Tarrasch setup to the London recommended in many sources.  Though I eventually won that game, coaxed by errors on my opponent's part, I struggled to concoct the type of counterplay and double-edged positions I usually thrive in.} 6. Ngf3 Bg7 {With this move, I am essentially offering a gambit in the form of my c-pawn, since after dxc5 white can hold onto the pawn, i.e. 7. dc Nd7 8. Nb3 a5 (for instance) 9. a4.  This was a conscious decision on my part, because by snatching the pawn, white would give me counterplay in the center, following a space-gaining ...e5 and increased scope of my KB along the h8-a1 diagonal.} 7. dxc5 Nh5 8. Bg3 {After 8. Bg5, I considered 8. ...f6!? 9. Bh4 e5 as a way to keep the position double-edged, possibly followed by ...O-O, ...Qe8, and ...f5.} Nxg3 {I figured I had nothing to gain by delaying this capture, which was the entire goal of ...Nh5, so it was best to proceed with it.} 9. hxg3 {Black wins the two bishops, white has her extra pawn and half-open h-file, however the question is posed of where her king shall go, since castling kingside negates the later imbalance, castling queenside may prove hazardous as my fianchettoed bishops points yonder that direction, and remaining in the center...well, I'll let the game speak for itself.} e5 {!? The most active and congruent follow-up.  I do give white juicy hole on d6 that I'm sure she'd love to plant a knight on, however, as the old saw goes: "One must give up squares to gain squares."  I knew that white would most likely strike back in the center with a corresponding e4 whether I played ...e5 or not so I had to play actively.  I was looking at some sample variations at this point and decided that even if she did get to play Nd6, I have resources and counterplay available, and it wouldn't necessarily be the death of me.} 10. e4 d4 {10. ...O-O was also possible, maintaining tension in the center.  Now here is a sample variation: 11. Nc4 O-O 12. Nd6 dc 13. bc Qa5, with a very double-edged game.  Joanne elects an alternate course.} 11. cxd4 exd4 12. Bb5 {! Active development, and threatening to ruin what was left of my pawn structure.} O-O {! And I permit it, with my blessing.  I didn't think I could take time-out to play the limp 12. ...Bd7 to prevent the weakening of my pawns, when after 13. Nc4 white is standing very well.  Again, since I'm already down material, I must continue to play actively to justify the pawn sacrifice and attempt to wrest the intiative in this position.  12. ...O-O breaks the pin, brings my KR into play, and whisks my king to safety.  Yes, safety, on white's same half-open h-file.  It seems paradoxical, but black's king is much safer here than in the center, because white doesn't have the piece coordination to exploit an attack along the h-file.} 13. Bxc6 {?! To be honest, I didn't think this was a good practical decision by white.  At least, I personally would have been adverse to it.  I could see white's thinking; up material, continue to hack wood and simplify, splatter black's remaining queenside pawns, mop up the positional trumps and eventually win.  Of course, chess is often not this simple.  By getting rid of her other bishop, black's two bishops become that much more emphatic in a fluid, semi-open position such as this, and I do gain a nice open b-file for my QR to exert pressure upon.} bxc6 {Whatever "objective" analysis of the position may declare, I was quite comfortable at this point, and felt I'd attained the type of position I enjoyed playing.} 14. b4 {?! I thought this move was a waste of time, and somewhat loosening.  It seems to consolidate white's extra pawn as a strongpoint on c4, but since I wasn't taking extreme pains to recoup it, 14. Qa4 or 14. O-O must be preferred.} a5 {Undermining the enemy chain, although that is in fact only a secondary consideration to the real point of this move.} 15. a3 Ba6 {...which is this move.  Now white's king is marooned in the center, a very precarious place to be, in my opinion.  My bishops are very actively posted on long diagonals, exerting influence on many squares.  I wanted to play ...a5 first because the rook-pawn would be much more useful in front of the bishop than behind it, and I figured I could reasonably predict 15. a3, so I could afford the tempo expended.} 16. Rc1 {Evacuating the QR off the loose h8-a1 diagonal, and covering the c4 square for a potential Nc4, to siphon off my LSB's access.} Re8 {Continuing to play actively and improve the position of my pieces.  Now the e-pawn will hang if white plays 17. Nc4, and more importantly, the very strong 18. ...f5 is threatened, wrenching open the center route to the enemy king.  I had considered the immediate 17. ...f5, but saw after 18. Qb3ch Kh8 19. e5! Re8 20. Nc4 Bxc4 21. Qxc4 Bxe5 (21. ...f6 22. O-O fe 23. Nd6 is annoying to meet) 22. O-O, I regain my pawn, but white weasels away and I don't even have my two bishops anymore for comfort. With 16. ...Re8 I keep the pressure.  I believe black already has a sizable advantage here.} 17. Qb3 {The best move, preventing ...f5 for the time being and actively posting the queen on the g8-a2 diagonal.} Ra7 {!? A cagey, queer-looking waiting move, but quite strong.  For one thing, it covers the f7 pawn, so it doesn't hang after a subsequent ...Kh8.  In some variations I also envisioned it swinging over and doubling up on the e-file.  Again, improving the placement of my pieces while forcing white to make accurate replies in a bad defensive position.} 18. Ng1 {? If you have to play moves like 18. Ng1, punishment is very likely, and likely swift.  I could see white's thinking; free up the f-pawn of defensive maneuvers (18. ...Qg5 19. f4; 18. ...Kh8 19. f4 f5 20. e5, locking up the Lincoln Tunnel), and maybe redevelop it on e2 in some cases.  However, it's very slow, and dangerous as it's essentially an "undevelopment" move in a razor-sharp position.} a4 {! A second pawn sacrifice, entirely justified to increase my time-based initiative.  I intend to deflect the queen off the g8-a2 diagonal so I can play ...f5 immediately, or 19. Qa2 play 19. ...Qg5, threatening 20. ...Rxe4!, and white cannot play 20. f4 as in the previous position because the white queen no longer covers g3.} 19. Qxa4 f5 20. f3 {? An ugly capitulation to make.  White had to bite the bullet with 20. Qxc3 fe 21. b5!? for any hope of counterplay in this position, taking advantage of the pawn phalanx on her queenside.} fxe4 21. fxe4 {With 21. Nxe4 I intended to exchange sacrifice with 21. ...Rxe4, removing one of white's active piece defenders, and following up with 22. ...Qg5, however the simple and effective 21. ...d3 (threatening ...d2ch!) is winning without further muddying the waters.} Qg5 22. Qb3+ {?! Covers g3 with tempo, however now black's attack now soldiers on without any real white counters to worry about.} Kh8 {It's not really appetizing to play moves like 23. Rd1, 23. Kd1, or 23. Rh4 in such a position, even if they are the "best" candidates.  White choice ends the struggle at once.} 23. Nh3 Rxe4+ {! Crashing through, taking advantage of the knight pin against the c1 rook.  White must play 24. Kd1 (24. Nxe4 Qxc1ch 25. Kf2 (25. Qd1 Qe3ch and mates next move) Qxh1, picking up the other rook), when 24. ...Qg4ch 25. Kc2 (25. Qf3 Be2ch!; 25. Nf3 Re3, with ...Rxf3 to follow) Re2 white is placed in a tortuous bind and her position will eventually collapse. An instructure miniature about the dangers of giving your opponent too many tactical possibilities in exchange for static positional advantages, especially if the position is anything but static!
