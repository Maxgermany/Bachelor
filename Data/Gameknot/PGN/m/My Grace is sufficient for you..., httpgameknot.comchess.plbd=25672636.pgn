1. d4 g6 2. Bf4 Bg7 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nbd2 Nd7 5. e3 a6 6. c3 b5 7. Bd3 {7.Bd3 An excellent London System against a Hypermodernist.  The London System can be used for virtually every defense the the Black pieces can conjure.  This offensive opening has foolowed all the opening principles thus far and should be a sound position.  Seemingly passive?  Ha...just goading Black to advance poorly!  On the other side of the board, Black has chosen to wiat on a good home for the King's Knight.  this is a theorectical ploy in the Modern Defense.  Either Nh6 looking for f7 after the f-pawn advances or e7 after that pawn advances.  Often here you may find a "Hippo" structure without the advanced b-pawn.  Also a very strong defense.  Obviously this game is starting very positional and will play well to those wanting a highly strategic game. } Bb7 8. Be4 {8.Be4 This is the first violation of opening principles.  "Avoid moving any piece twice before the Rooks are connected or an opening sequence is complete" (humbly, my wording only).  Obviously there are exceptions especially when material or some static/dynamic can be obtained.  Once a principle is violated by one, the opponent must look at the cost but often looks to "see" how to punish the violation. Another "candidate" move should be considered in line with opening principles unless a tactic can earn an advantage.  Other CM's might be 0-0, h3 to tuck the DSB away if needed, and even a theorectical a5 often played to "attack" Black's Queenside or al least offer tension.} c6 9. h3 Ngf6 10. O-O O-O 11. Nh4 {11.Nh4   "Knights on the Rim are dim". This is now also known as a "hanging piece".  With the right or accurate tactics, this piece could be captured "en pris".  What is, 1....Nh5 threatening the DSB 2.Bh2 e5 exposing the Knight to an eyeful Queen and causing center disruption?     } e5 12. dxe5 dxe5 13. Bg3 Re8 14. b4 Nd5 15. Bxd5 cxd5 {Just a personal quest to bring pawns to the center.  They offer so much tension and anxiety for the opponent.  The hypermodernist dream? lol} 16. Ndf3 Rc8 17. Qb3 e4 18. Nh2 {18.Nh2 Two pawns on the rim make dim, dim, dim.  Now watch how the play continues.  It is Black's idea to take advantage of the two pieces "out of play".  This was a nice idea most often practiced by Tal, who would enter combinations that might even lose material but because the opponent's pieces were "out of play", the tactic would actually be even!} Rxc3 19. Qd1 {18. Qd1 The rest of the game is a "simplification".  White has 4 pieces working while Black has six.  With offering trades and gaining better position while enhancing a "winning position".  Many a player may start pawn grabbing, but not necessary and actually dangerous against a player like Mervyn!  He should me a game of his where he was done material adding to 16 points and miraculously checkmated this weary opponent!   } Rd3 20. Qc2 Bxa1 21. Rxa1 Qf6 22. Rc1 Rc8 23. Qb1 Rdc3 24. Rxc3 Qxc3 25.
