[Opening "Four knights (C47), Scotch, Krause variation"]

1. e4 {in this game, white went into a won endgame, but played a huge blunder in the very end.  But black resigned before trying to play out the position. This mistake was probably made by a miscalculation, as you will see.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 {this is the so called 4 knights scotch. } Bb4 {I do not know any theory on this opening, but this defense seems reasonable. White has no way to make any material gains.} 5. Nxe5 {acceptable. } Nxe5 {I consider that this is a mistake. The better move was probably 6.Nxe4, but here white still wins the majority of games.} 6. dxe5 {now black's position is much worse. The black knight has only 1 safe retreat, and that is back to g8. Black is forced to play 6...Nxe4 as the game went, or 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 Nxe4 8.Qg4! winning material(8...Nxc3 9.Qc4).} Nxe4 7. Qg4 {(!) this tricky move is best. Black has no way to prevent material losses. This transposes into the previous line I mentioned.} d5 8. Qxg7 Rf8 9. a3 {an interesting choice. I cannot analyze all the lines, but this looks safe. } Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 c6 {after this move, white wins decisive material.} 11. Bh6 {the winning move.} Qe7 {this loses the exchange. White simply plays 12.Qxf8+ Qxf8 13.Bxf8 Kxf8} 12. Bd3 {acceptable, as the rook is not going anywhere soon.} Bf5 13. Qxf8+ Qxf8 14. Bxf8 Kxf8 {white already has a decisive material advantage. He now uses the pin on the knight to win more material.} 15. f3 Re8 16. fxe4 Rxe5 {black's position is hopeless here, as he is a full rook down.} 17. O-O dxe4 18. Rxf5 Rxf5 19. Bxe4 {great use of transformation of advantages. White completely clears the smoke from the board and still maintains his huge material advantages. @nuntar: It is probably better to keep more material, but I just like crystal clear positions.} Rc5 20. Bxh7 Rxc3 21. Bd3 c5 22. Kf2 c4 23. Be4 b5 24. Rb1 a6 25. h4 Rxa3 26. h5 Kg7 27. g4 Kh6 28. Ke2 Rh3 29. Rf1 Rh4 30. Bf5 b4 31. Rb1 a5 {black is trying to generate counterplay, but white should still win.} 32. Kd2 Rh2+ 33. Ke3 Rh3+ 34. Kd4 Rc3 35. Ke5 b3 36. cxb3 cxb3 {generating counterplay. Black has 2 passed pawns down the queen side. Now white must really carefully.} 37. Ra1 Rc5+ 38. Kf6 b2 39. Re1 Rc1 40. Re8 {threatening mate.} Rc6+ 41. Kxf7 a4 42. Re6+ {transforming advantages again. The endgame is easily won for white.} Rxe6 43. Kxe6 a3 44. Bb1 {now the 2 black pawns are blockaded. The safest strategy is to directly march his king to the black pawns and win them. Both of white's pawn are indirectly defended(thanks nuntar).} Kg7 45. g5 Kh8 46. Kf7 {(??) a blunder that throws the game away. However, black actually resigned at this point. However, I will continue the annotation to show that black can easily draw with his only legal move!} a2 {the only legal move in the position. IT draws easily.} 47. g6 {the only challenging continuation. 47.Bxa2 b1Q 48.Bxb1= In his analysis, black must have thought that 46...a2 47.g6 axb1Q 48.g7+ Kh7 49.g8Q was hopeless. It is not at all.} axb1=Q {the only move. } 48. g7+ Kh7 49. g8=Q+ Kh6 {Now we see the whole point. The black pawn queens and controls the g6 square and protects against mate. Black prematurely resigned in a drawn position. It never hurts to play on! In fact, white is the one here who will be trying to draw.}
