[Opening "KGA (C39), Kieseritsky, Rice gambit"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {The king's gambit isn't an opening I regularly assay.  Without giving too much away, it isn't really my style - all those wild complications...  } exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 { Nevertheless, if you're going to play it you may as well do so aggressively and 4. h4 is fairly aggressive - without being 100% committal.  By forcing Black to advance his g-pawn, White hopes to pick up the weakened f-pawn later.} g4 5. Ne5 Nf6 6. Bc4 d5 {A useful freeing move for Black.  He's happy to give back the pawn in return for open play and a counter attack.} 7. exd5 Bd6 8. d4 Nh5 9. O-O {Black now has a plethora of options: should he take on h4 with his queen (hoping for a quick mate after ...g3 and Qh2  )? or maybe castle immediately now that White has opened the e-file?  The move played (...Ng3) attacks the rook on f1, but I would have marginally prefered getting another piece out rather than moving an existing one.  Incidentally, if 9...Qxh4, White would play 10. Bxf4, and then if 10...Nxf4, White recaptures with the rook and Black can't advance his g-pawn immediately, since it is pinned to his queen.} Ng3 {Attacking the rook on f1.  White is pretty much forced to give up the exchange here.  If he tries to save it with 10. Re1 (or 10. Rf2), then Black simply plays 10...Qxh4 and the check on h1 will be curtains!} 10. Bxf4 {Finally capturing the stubborn f-pawn.  Black now has another chance to take on h4.  However, after 10...Qxh4 11.Bxg3 11...Qxg3, the f-file would be opened for the rook, and things could prove difficult for Black. (Note in that case that White shouldn't take on f7 immediately (12. Nxf7??) since that would open the b8-h2 diagonal for the Black bishop and allow the akward 12...Qh2 !)} Nxf1 11. Qxf1 f6 {I'm not sure about this, though.  11...Qxh4 was to be preferred.  The problem with ...f6 is that it weakens the white sqaures around Black's king but White on the other hand is not obliged to move the attacked knight - he can sacrifice it instead!...} 12. Nc3 {(!) Played more or less on intuition...} fxe5 {Quite correct - Black will need as much material as possible in the coming fireworks...} 13. Bg5 {A crucial moment.  Black's Q is attacked. He doesn't want to play ...Be7 as that allows 14. d6! (opening the Bc4's diagonal) and then mate on f7 or loss of the Be7 follows.  Equally, playing 13...Qd7 instead blocks in his Bishop on c8 and invites White to try for Bb5 at some point, pinning Queen against King.} Qd7 {The lesser of two evils.} 14. dxe5 {(?) A mistake.  14. Ne4 would have been stronger, keeping the pressure on.} Bc5+ {The counter attack begins!} 15. Kh1 Qf5 {White is in trouble.  If the queens are exchanged, he will just be a piece down for minimal compensation...} 16. Qe2 {Trying to avoid the inevitable...} Qf2 {Black insists on the exchange.  White is running out of places to put his Queen.} 17. Qe4 Bf5 {White has nowhere to put his queen, other than back on e2 where it will be exchanged. So... he just leaves it where it is!} 18. Bb5+ {The only way. By clearing the fourth rank White makes way for his Queen - it can go accross to a4 if necessary.} c6 {Now it's Black's turn to slip.  He didn't want to block the check with ...Nd7 because of 19. e6 attacking the pinned piece.  In that variation, as in the game, White sacs his queen: 18...Nd7 19. e6! and now, if 19...Bxe4 White has 20. Bxd7  20...Kf8 (forced) 21. Nxe4 (forking Q and B) and Black must either allow his Queen to be taken or move it to d4 and permit perpetual check with 22. Rf1  ...Kg8 and 23. Nf6  (if 22... Kg7? 23 Bf6  wins the Queen).  Wild stuff!} 19. dxc6 {White sacrifices his Queen!} Kf8 {If Black had captured 19...Bxe4, White has 20. cxb7  (disc.) 20...Nd7 21.Nxe4 (getting rid of the defender of a8) and now either white makes a new queen while at the same time capturing the Ra8, or - if Black blocks with 21...Rb8 - 22. Nxf2!  The final twist is that although Black can now capture the knight on f2 with 22...Bxf2 (when he'll be momentarily ahead on material again), this allows the crushing 23. e6!, winning the pinned knight.  In this last variation White will be two pawns up one of which is on d7, just ready to make another queen!} 20. cxb7 {Giving Black another chance to take his queen on e4.} Bxe4 {Which he does!  White is now 10 pawns down, having sacrificed first a rook, then a knight and last of all his queen!  But amazingly, his position is completely won...} 21. Nxe4 {The last hurdle.  If White makes a new queen immediately with 21. bxa8=Q?? it will just get taken by the Black Bishop on e4.} Qxc2 {Trying to get some more material in view of what's about to happen...} 22. bxa8=Q {Suddenly White is the equivalent of a whole rook up, and his attack is still raging...} Kf7 {Indirectly protecting the knight on b8 by getting out of the way of the rook on h8.  But unfortunately...} 23. Qd5+ {This check wins the Bc5 instead.  It's all over now.} Kg7 24. Bf6+ {White goes for mate instead.} Kg6 25. Bxh8 {Removing the last defender in the vicinity of the king.  White now threatens 26. Qe6  26...Kh5 27. Qf7  27...Kxh5 (if ...Kh6 instead, 28. Bg7   is mate) 28. Bf6  } Kf5 26. Rf1+ {Mate will follow shortly (e.g. 26..Kg6 27.Qf7  27...Kh6 28. Bg7  ).  A classic King's Gambit; virtually impossible to tell who's winning from one move to the next!
