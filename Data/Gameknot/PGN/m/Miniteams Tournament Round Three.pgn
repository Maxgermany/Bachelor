1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Bc4 {Scottish Gambit! My specialty! My opponent took an extremely long time for the next move. After the match he admitted that he was very unfamiliar with this opening. He countered fairly effectively though, relying on instinct.} h6 {Stopping 5 Ng5. When Black plays this, I like to play it like a regular Scotch opening.} 5. Nxd4 Bc5 6. Bxf7+ {! 6...Kxf7 7 Qh5+ then 8 Qxc5 giving White the advantage.} Kf8 {!? This move completely shocked me. This is probably a much better move over 6...Kxf7} 7. Nxc6 bxc6 8. Qf3 {Fearing 8...Bxf2+ 9 Kxf2 Qf6+ 10 Qf3 Qxf7 making things fairly equal. It forces Black to develop though. Perhaps 8 Bxg8 would have been better. It would be trading a very useful bishop away but it would prevent the future pains to come.} Qf6 9. Qxf6 Nxf6 10. Bg6 {At this point I laughed at the fact that we had already used half of our time, with only ten moves complete. His clock had nine minutes left, and my clock had fourteen minutes left.} d6 {? Not necessary at all....} 11. Nc3 Ng4 {Threatening Bxf2} 12. O-O {? The natural move. f3 would have been much better, even though castling would be spoiled. I seriously considered 12 Nd1! which would have given Black no targets, and White time to repel Black's knight with 13 h3. I dismissed it though, because it was such an odd move and I considered it risky (because it was odd), silly thinking on my part, but that was my logic at the time.} Ba6 {! A beautiful move! White should have seen this. This wins the rook, if 13 Re1 then Bxf2+. If 13 Rd1 then Nxf2.} 13. Na4 {Perhaps the best compensation} Bxf1 14. Nxc5 dxc5 {A beautiful sight, tripled pawns are.} 15. Kxf1 Ke7 {? Why not 15...Nxh2+? Black was under considerable time pressure though. His clock read four minutes while mine was seven minutes.} 16. Bf4 {Protecting the h pawn while threatening 17 Bxc7} Kf6 17. Bf5 Ne5 18. g3 {Preparing for 19 Bxe5 Kxe5 20 f4+} g6 {? Giving a pawn away.} 19. Bxe5+ Kxe5 20. Bxg6 Rhg8 21. f4+ Kf6 22. Bf5 {Possibly 22 Bh5 would be a better alternative....} h5 23. Bd7 Rad8 24. Bxc6 Rd2 {Yikes!} 25. e5+ Ke6 {? Another error. We were tied at about three minutes each at this moment. My opponent stopped notating, but I wished to continue notating. I wasted precious time, but I was able to eventually get someone to notate for me.} 26. c4 {First move that popped into my mind. At this moment my savior Andrew Selzler arrived to notate (I just said, "Hey you! Can you please notate my game? Oh thank you! Thank you so much!" I didn't know who he was, just a random stranger to me).} Rxh2 27. Bd5+ Ke7 28. Bxg8 {? Kg1 would have solved things right? Time pressure screws with you...} Rh1+ 29. Kg2 Rxa1 30. f5 Re1 31. f6+ Kf8 32. f7 Rxe5 33. Kf3 Rf5+ 34. Ke4 Rg5 35. Kf3 Rg4 {I offered a draw somewhere in these moves. He had less than a minute, and I had a little more than a minute.} 36. b3 Rd4 37. Ke3 Rg4 38. Kf3 a5 39. a3 {? this should be a losing move, a4 is much better} Rd4 40. Ke3 h4 {? Rd1 would have been much more ideal.} 41. gxh4 Rxh4 {"The offer for a draw still stands, you know..."} 42. Kd2 Rh3 43. Kc2 Rg3 44. a4 c6 45. Kb2 Rf3 46. Kc2 Rg3 47. Kb2 Rh3 48. Kc2 {"Okay, a draw?" "Yeah, good game!" After the match I talked to Andrew, and learned of his identity. I thanked him profusely and asked him to write "Notated by Andrew Selzler" because I always keep my notation sheets.}
