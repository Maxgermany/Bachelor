1. d4 {Hi everyone, I am now black against Bob - ding, ding, it is Round 6!  Can I end this winless run against Bob?  Well, read on and find out!  Here I decide to go ........ Dutch.} f5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 {4. .......... Bg7 - some standard Dutch manoeuverings here!} 5. e3 d6 6. O-O O-O 7. c4 c6 8. Nc3 e6 {8. .......... e6 - both sides have now castled and I play e6 to keep my options open as to which of my pawns to advance at a later date.  Next move I play my pawn up to b7 and by move 12 the decks have been cleared between Glenda and my rooks.} 9. Rb1 b6 10. b3 Bb7 11. Bb2 Nbd7 12. Qe2 a6 13. a4 e5 {13. ........ e5 - it is the e pawn I choose to advance - this opens things up a little.} 14. dxe5 dxe5 15. Rfd1 Qc7 16. Rd2 Rfd8 17. Rbd1 e4 {17. ......... e4 - after white doubles rooks on the d file I seek more spatial control by playing e4.} 18. Ng5 Nf8 {18. ....... Nf8 - to prevent a knight fork on e6.  A plethora of exchanges is about to take place.} 19. f3 exf3 20. Bxf3 Rxd2 21. Rxd2 Rd8 22. Qg2 Rxd2 23. Qxd2 Qd7 24. Qg2 {24. Qg2 - eschews queen swap and puts pressure on c6.  A knight swap now follows.} Ne6 25. Nxe6 Qxe6 26. e4 fxe4 27. Nxe4 Nxe4 28. Bxg7 Kxg7 29. Bxe4 Qd6 {29. .......... Qd6 - after a further plethora of exchanges I move Glenda to d6 to maintain protection of c6 - this move also prepares a move such as Qb4 where I may swap my c pawn for white's b pawn, splitting up the white pawns in the process.} 30. Qc2 Bc8 31. Qg2 {31. Qg2?! - tries to renew pressure on c6 but I now force a swap of c pawn for b pawn.} Qd1+ 32. Kf2 {32. Kf2?? - I think this is the losing move as white had to block the check to avoid dropping his c pawn as well as his b pawn.  Whatever the jury decides here, white drops a pawn.} Qxb3 33. Bxc6 Qxc4 34. Be8 Qc2+ 35. Kg1 Qxg2+ 36. Kxg2 {36. Kxg6 - after winning a pawn I force a queen swap to try and win the bishop ending a pawn up.} Kf8 37. Bc6 Ke7 38. Kf3 Bd7 39. Bb7 {39. Bb7 - eschews bishop swap - if you go into K & P ending a pawn down you go into a losing ending - must be avoided like the plague!} a5 {39. ......... a5 - fixes a pawn on a light square - this pawn will drop off soon putting me two clear pawns up.} 40. Bd5 Bxa4 41. Bg8 h6 42. Bc4 Bd7 {42. ........ Bd7 - consolidation after winning my second pawn.} 43. Ke3 b5 44. Bd3 g5 45. Be2 a4 {45. ........... a4 - passed pawns must be pushed!} 46. Bd1 a3 47. Bb3 Be6 {47. .......... Be6 - after this move Bob waves the white flag.  This technique is reminiscent of the technique I used against a 1753 player in one of Jo's Successful Endgames annotated a few months ago.  Frere Leblanc controls the a2-g8 diagonal.  Whether white trades bishops or moves the bishop away, there is no stopping Glenda from making a reappearance two moves down the line and cleaning up the last two white pawns and turning her attention to the white king.  Hope you have had a good read!  Bye for now.  Joanne}
