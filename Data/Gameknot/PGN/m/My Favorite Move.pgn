[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 c5 {54th GK Tournament, I'm black. My oponent opens with my favorite move, so I give him the Sicilian to chew on.} 2. c3 Nf6 {White chose the Alapin Variation, intending to build a strong center with a pawn at d4. Black's response is the main line, pressuring the white pawn on e4 and inviting white to delay his push to d4.} 3. e5 Nd5 {Still mainline. Black's knight seeks to prevent white from playing a pawn to f4 where it would support that advanced e5 pawn. This position bears a little resemblance to Alekhine's Defense, one move delayed with the pawns on c3 and c5. That extra oomph in the center makes this stronger for black than Alekhine's is.} 4. Bc4 e6 {Tempting white to give up the two bishops to double the black pawns in the center. Howver, d5, d6, and c5 isn't a tremendously weak formation.} 5. Bxd5 exd5 6. Qf3 d6 {OK, I admit, I found this line in the GK World Database and it appeared favorable, so I played it. To me, it looks like 6. d6?! is a dubious play at best, giving up a pawn for insufficient compensation. However, given the moves that follow, most of which is rooted right here, the compensation might be more than it appears.} 7. Qxd5 Nc6 {This is where black would like to bring his king's knight into play threatening the white queen and chasing her off, gaining a tempo. But that knight has already been traded. This is still continuing from the DB.} 8. exd6 Bxd6 {Well, drat, white gained a pawn and all black has to show for it is a lead in development. Is it enough?} 9. Qe4+ Be6 10. Nf3 O-O 11. O-O Re8 {Normal developing moves. Black is still ahead in development, and now he occupies the e-file with a rook, glaring directly at the white queen.} 12. Qa4 b5 {White runs his queen off to safety, but now the white king is in grave danger. With 12. ... b5! black sets the wheels in motion for a kingside attack. Yes, kingside. Black would like to play 12. ... Bd5 followed by 13. ... Bxf6 14. gxf6 Qh5 to threaten mate on h2. But there are two flaws. White has 13. Qd1 to protect his knight, and white has 15. Qxh5 killing black's queen from all the way across the board. Such a pretty combo ruined by white's queen. So black offers her a sacrificial pawn to get her onto a much better square. Better for black.} 13. Qxb5 Bd5 {White didn't sense the danger. 13. Qxb5? loses quite a bit of material for white, but the checkmate is not a guarantee yet. Still, white is in trouble here. He should have asked himself why black threw away a pawn with 12. ... b5! and if he did, he may have stayed away from the poisoned pawn. The threat now is that black has 4 pieces (two bishops, rook, and queen) all ready to spring into action against white's king, and his queen is too far away to help - so is his undeveloped queenside.} 14. Qd3 Be4 {White tried to bring her back, but not enough. He's far from out of danger. 15. Qe2 is the saving move here, though it loses a piece to 15. ... Bxb1.} 15. Qc4 Bxf3 {15. Qc4?? loses the game. Black cannot force checkmate, but he can force white to give up his queen, plus more material, to prevent it. 15. ... Bxf3 is how it starts.} 16. gxf3 Nd4 {16. Nd4!! This is my favorite move in a long time. Double exclamation. White's only option to survive is 17. Qxd4 cxd4 and white has lost his queen. Further, black still has a decent attack, though white may squirm out of it. The beauty of this move is that Black wanted to play 16. ... Qg5+?? to force a checkmate but he cannot. White would simply reply 17. Qg4 and black's attack dies, leaving black two pawns down with nothing to show for it. However, from d4, black's knight obstructs the white queen. Even if white captures the knight with his pawn on c3, black wins by checkmate.} 17. cxd4 Qg5+ {Forced mate in 7.} 18. Kh1 Qh4 {I would like to think that when black's queen moved here to h4, she gave a friendly little wave to the white pawn on d4.} 19. Kg2 Qxh2# {Final position. A point of interest is that, prior to playing 19. ... Qxh2#, black is behind by 5 points. I mention this because I have been commenting on several recent annotations that counting points is not always the way to win, as this game demonstrates. Back to this game, white could have delayed a few more moves with 19. f4 Bxf4 20. Kg2 Qg4+ 21. Kh1 Qh3 22. Qxf7+ Kxf7 23. (any) Qxh2#. Did all of this stem from 6. ... d6?!. No, not all. But it set the stage. I'm going to have to dig that up in a book (it's not in any books I have) to find out how much of this could have been played differently by white, and if 6. ... d6?! really is better than it looks.}
