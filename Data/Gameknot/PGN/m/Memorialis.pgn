1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e6 7. f3 b5 8. a4 b4 9. Na2 e5 10. Nb3 d5 11. Bg5 {M: A possible other route would be 11. e4xd5 Nf6xd5 12. Bf2 Bf6 13. Bc4} Be6 12. Bd3 dxe4 13. Bxe4 Qxd1+ 14. Rxd1 Ra7 15. Bxf6 {M: I would not have given away the pair of Bishops, even though that weakened my pawn structure. Maybe 15. Be3, occupying the long diagonal.} gxf6 16. Nac1 f5 17. Bd3 Nd7 18. a5 Nc5 19. Nxc5 Bxc5 {M: I take back with tempo ... now my two Bishops are nicely positioned ...} 20. g3 {M: I did not understand that move. It weakens your pawn structure on the King side. What about 20. Nb3} Bd4 21. b3 Ke7 22. Na2 Rd7 23. Kf1 {M: Maybe 23. Kd2 to combine the rooks and get control over c3 ... pushing the pawn to c3 later on?} Rb8 24. Kg2 {M: I think instead of 24. Kg2 it would have been better to take on a6. Kg2 gives me the chance to indirectly protect the pawn on a6 with Rd5. After Rd5 the pawn on a6 is "poisoned".} Rd5 25. Bxa6 {M: This take on a6 costs you the quality (N for a P) and opens the a-file for my rook!!! Maybe activating your h-rook would have been a rout to go (25. Rhf1 or 25. Rhe1).} Rxa5 26. Nxb4 Rxb4 27. Bd3 Ra2 28. Kh3 e4 {}
