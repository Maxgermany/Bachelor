1. b3 {Not the usual Grob, but this is my variation.} g6 {I find this move risky.} 2. Bb2 {Threatening the rook.} f6 {Most of my opponents block with the knight.} 3. g4 {Preparing g5.} g5 {Blocked.} 4. f4 {I won't give up!} gxf4 {Good.} 5. g5 {Now the pinned pawn is threatened.} d5 {My opponent should be trying to castle queenside, the kingside is too open.} 6. e3 {Wanting to play Qh5.} fxe3 {Now I can check the king, almost checkmate.} 7. Qh5+ {The only move is Kd7.} Kd7 {Uh-huh.} 8. Bh3+ {The king is in trouble and is forced to block or run.} Kc6 {The king is becoming very open.} 9. Ne2 {Wanting to play Nd4.} Bxh3 {Takes the bishop. A swap.} 10. Qxh3 {I take back.} exd2+ {The advanced pawn is finally swapped.} 11. Nxd2 {I take back.} h5 {?? Should be giving the king extra protection.} 12. Nd4+ {The king is now in big trouble.} Kd6 {After the bishop checks the king the king is in the open and with not many escape squares. I didn't see checkmate in two. Qe6+ Kc5 Ba3#.} 13. Ba3+ {Should've played Qe6, but anyway.} Ke5 {Only possible square.} 14. Nd2f3+ {The king is checked by the knight who also protects the knight on d4.} Ke4 {Again, the only possible square.} 15. Qh4+ {After the king moves, its checkmate.} Ke3 {The king moves.} 16. Bc1# {Checkmate. Apart from the fact that I could checkmated my opponent on move 14, it was a good game.}
