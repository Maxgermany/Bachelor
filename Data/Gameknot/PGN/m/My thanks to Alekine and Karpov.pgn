[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {This is most likely, black's most snarly move this promises to be a very spirited affair. } 5. Nc3 {when black plays an early ...Nf6 I try to aim for the Keres attack with f3 and g4. } a6 6. f3 {following my plan to play g4 so black should be active in order to avoid g4. } Qb6 {The Sicilian Najdorf with ...Qb6. This is not Black's most optimistic move. Far more testing is 6. ...e5 which takes advantage white some what slow 6. f3. However, this line can not be all that bad since } 7. g4 {Kasparov vs. Grischuk it when as follows 7... Nc6 8. Nb3 e6 9. Qe2 Qc7 10. Be3 b5 11. O-O-O Bb7 12. h4 Rc8 13. g5 Nd7 14. Qf2 Nce5 15. a3 Qd8 16. Bd4 Nc6 17. Be3 Nce5 18. Bd4 Nc6 19. Be3 Nce5 20. Bd4 1/2-1/2} Nc6 8. Nb3 e6 9. Qe2 {This is more flexible than 9. Be2 because the queen can float over to g2 to support g4-g5. It also threatens Be3 gaining tempo against the black queen. } d5 {!? this is dubious at best because any center action at this point would highlight white's superior piece development. Best most likely is Kasparov's 9 ...Qc7 strengthening his grip on dark square control.  } 10. exd5 {Here is the rub about 9. ...d5? because he does not control d5( I do) and now e6 is under serious pressure. So I have the better of it for sure. However, like all great defenders Drzemik does not panic but calmly thinks it through. } Nb4 {black does not have anything else better. } 11. Bg5 {an attempt to win the exchange on d5 if black is squeamish about exchanging on d5. } Nfxd5 {forced} 12. Nxd5 Nxd5 {Black gets a very good knight but at the cost of d-file and the forever, lingering threats on ...e6} 13. O-O-O {Threatening Rxd5 winning the knight} h6 {black has not else good} 14. Bh4 Be7 {Black's best chance for a draw is to simplify down to rooks and pawns. My goal is to simplify down to king pawns. I am banking my winning ideas of my advantaged king pawns. } 15. Bxe7 Nxe7 16. Qe5 {White has emerged from the opening with a clear advantage of space. So here is what I have learned from Alekine and Karpov. 1) bind/limit- force your opponent into a never ending cramped position. Forcing your opponent to make further weaknesses to create room to move. 2) Bind some more- use your superior piece position to force your opponent to sacrifice material in order stay alive 3) open lines to the kings with pawn breaks. } O-O {forced defending g7} 17. Bd3 {I am predicting that Drzemik wants to play ...Nc6. So Bd3 hits at the light square weaknesses around the king.} Nc6 {Maybe 17. ...Nd5 is better. The game move just encourages white to do what he wants to do anyway.} 18. Qe4 {threatening Qh7++ so black is forced to make further weakness around his king position} f5 {best because 18. ...g6 is met with 19.h4} 19. gxf5 exf5 20. Qf4 {again when all else is equal play a move that limits your opponents options. For example I can not prevent black from playing Be6. However, with the queen on f4 the Bishop has to stay on e6 and the f-rook has to stay at home. Plus Black also has to be very careful of any attacks on the g-file. } Be6 21. Rhe1 {now the gameknot post game engine says this is equal but these types of position always fool engines. But I will make things clear} Bxb3 22. axb3 Rad8 {White has added superior pawn structure and central dominance to his space advantage. This is more than enough for the win. } 23. c3 {limiting black's choices now both ...Qa5 and Nb4 can not aid in the defense of ..f5} Rf6 24. h4 {Here comes the h-pawn and nothing can stop it. } a5 25. Bc4+ {Look at this Black is being parted like the Red sea and like the children of the Israel the white pieces will walk through on dry land. } Kh7 26. Kb1 {black is so tied down that any move will let white walk right in the door. } Rff8 27. h5 {entombing the black king in a chamber of light squares. Now for those who are reading this from our club I wrote a thread on successful pawn breaks against the castled king. In that thread I posted a diagram of a basic position of where black had played the f-pawn. In this basic pattern the key to a successful attack is controlling the a2-g8 diagonal. And guess who controls it. } Qc5 {Black last ditch chance is attacking the b3 pawn. So...} 28. Qc7 {Black losses a pawn and is forced to play 28. ...Rxd1+ because if white is allowed to play Rxd8 it is lights out } Rxd1+ 29. Rxd1 a4 30. Qxb7 {black is forced to take on b3 in order to keep up.} axb3 {forced} 31. Bd5 Na5 {black tries to hold onto the material balance but I now have a past c-pawn so I go to exchange the queens } 32. Qb4 Rc8 33. Qxc5 Rxc5 34. Bf7 {threatening mate} Rc8 {forced if 4. ...Rc6 35. Bg6+ and black has to give up the rook to avoid mate. } 35. Kc1 {Now in Rook-Bishop-Pawn vs Rook-Knight-Pawn endings you need a one pawn advantage to win. So either f5 or b3 is gone but black can not defend both. So in a nutshell the game is over. } Nc4 36. Re1 Kh8 37. Re7 Kh7 38. f4 Na5 39. Bg6+ Kg8 40. Bxf5 {for the win!} Kf8 41. Ra7 Rc5 42. Bg6 Nc4 43. Rf7+ Kg8 44. Rb7 Kf8 45. Rxb3 Nd6 46. Rb8+ Ke7 47. Rg8 Kf6 {Now the b and c pawns will steam roll over black} 48. Kc2 Rc7 49. b3 Nb5 50. Rf8+ Ke6 51. c4 Nd4+ 52. Kc3 Nb5+ 53. Kb4 Nd4 54. f5+ Ke5 55. Re8+ Kf6 56. c5 Rb7+ 57. Kc4 Nxb3 58. Re6+ Kg5 59. c6 Na5+ 60. Kc5 Rb3 61. c7 Rc3+ 62. Kb6 Rc1 63. Kxa5 {black gets the c-pawn but the white king with make is way unmolested to feast on g7. }
