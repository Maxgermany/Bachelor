Rxe4 {he gives up the exchange thinking that he will regain it with Nxf6 next move} dxe4 {but i take the Rook....} 32. Nxf6 {he takes on f6 with a 3 way fork!} exf3 {but I ignore that......} 33. Nxd7 {so he takes my Queen.....} Rxh4# {overlooking that Rxh4 is mate due to the pin on the g Pawn and that 32... exf3 covers the only other square available for his king.  okay a win against 'Fisher' not quite like winning against the great Bobby Fischer but still an enjoyable game..  Thanks for looking.}
