[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {I start off conventionally.} e5 {So does he.} 2. Nf3 {As usual, I develop.} f6 {?? It might not have been 2...Nc6, or 2...Nf6, but I anticipated something like 2...d5.  But, this is where he starts to go wrong.   this move was a blunder. Don't know why you played this, but best was 2...Nf6, developing your N, at once. And, this is a weakness. In general, you want to develop your minor pieces, and advance center pawns. But, one of the worst things to do, in the opening is to advance the f6. First, this prevents your Ng8 from coming into play. Second, the f square is your weakes pawn on the chess board. Unless it were a KG which is 1.e3, e5 2.f5, in general, anything else with the f pawn before developing gets you in trouble. So, this move, is the nutorious Domino Defense, which is, therefore, going to lose material.  Of course, I mispelled it and meant Damino. I also forgot to say that 2...Nc6 is also good which would then follow up with 3.Bb5, 3.Bc4, or 3.Nc3  In addition, 2...Nf6, could lead to 3.Nc3, or 3.Nxe5, and after 3...Nxe4, 4.Re1  When I wrote this, I was very tired and came back late.  And, it happened just before logging off for the night.  Yet, I was going to stay up a little late to help him improve, as for me, if I'm off the next day, it's at the top of my list of things to do.} 3. Nxe5 {Not forgetting about the Defense since that happened with a game against chicoboy, I take.} fxe5 {?? He takes back.  So, I said,  believe it or not, I did not blunder that N. The thing is that, often, stronger players don't just give things away, and when they do, there is a reason. So, the logic is, "To take is a mistake."  I said that because I'm going to expose his King, with my next move. } 4. Qh5+ Ke7 {However, he made the right choice by not kicking my Queen.} 5. Qxe5+ {Joe: It's a good thing, however, that you didn't play 4...g6, as this move would've lost a Rook because your Rh8 and Ke7 would've been forked.  } Kf7 {Magnus: Smart I just realized what you ment What What does that mean  Joe: It is a good thing. When you understand, it starts becoming second nature.} 6. Qf5+ {Magnus: No I was talking about the "to take is a mistake"  Joe: Sometimes, stronger players give things away. And, when they do, it's important to ask yourself why. Sometimes, when you take a pawn or piece, they get something worth more like the Queen, or sometimes, a checkmate.} Ke8 {Magnus: Ya most of the Time I try to defend it this game I didn't  Joe: Yes, trying to defend is very important.} 7. Bc4 {Magnus: But this game I messed up} Ne7 {?? Joe: ?? Yes, and this loses immediately. In this position, you're only options were 7...d4 or 7...Qe7, to prevent mate. By playing this, white mates. In addition to developing your pieces, it's important to be aware of all threats made by your opponent.} 8. Qf7# {After this game was over, I taught Magnus, by showing him an example, of a game that I lost by playing the Damino Defense.  In it, I said, the real moral, however, is to develop your minor pieces, castle, and control the center. And, unless necessary, don't move the f pawn which is the weakest square. That is why the Damino Defense is notorious. Playing that gives an advantage to white, as a start. I have a game that I lost by playing the Damino Defense, back in the day.}
