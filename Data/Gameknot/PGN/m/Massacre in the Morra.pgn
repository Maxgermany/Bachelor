[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence"]

1. e4 {I've been playing this weekend at the 2015 American Open in Anaheim, CA in the U/2200 section. Here's a game which I just finished playing which not only likely the fastest game of the section, is also rife with tactics and teachable play, and most of all fun to watch (as white). Recently, I've picked up this Smith-Morra gambit as white with relatively good success. I got white both games today, both Morras, and the first was a 20 move theoretical draw, so I was itching for a killing this game.  Also if you notice a large rating gap between white and black, I taught as a coach for 4 years at a chess club, and having been asked to play games against students while rusty I took many rating hits. I have played with fair success in U/2200 sections for over a year now, so although I dislike playing up (since it is rude to the other player) no reason to stop now. It is quite hilarious to see a 1877 playing a 2165 at board 1 in the U/2200 section (a different round of mine).  For your convenience, I recommend if you are not already, observe this game in interactive mode. There are far too many annotations to make scrolling page by page an enjoyable experience.} c5 2. d4 {The starting position of the Morra gambit. Black usually has a lot of fun in the Sicilian, however the Morra gambit essentially says:  White: "So Black, I'm going to give you a pawn, but in exchange I get to have all of the fun the entire game. Deal or no Deal."  2. cxd4 is the main way to play, all other moves transpose or are simply bad for black. For example, after 2...d6, white enjoys a comfortable position after 3. dxc5 Qa5+ 4. Nc3, ahead the tempos without the cost of the pawn. 2...e6 seems logical, however white enters a solid Benoni after 3. d5, which would take many Sicilian players out of their repertoire. Anyways, in this game black fully accepts the gambit, so let's just trod on ahead.  Note: Black was noticeably unnerved and unhappy with white's opening selection (alongside the pressure from playing down 250 rating points, and not knowing my actual strength level). Mission accomplished!} cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 {So now that the smoke has cleared, white is down a pawn, but is up a knight and a pawn (a powerful central pawn) in development. Meanwhile, with the (half) open c and d files, white will later activate his rooks splendidly. Now black must consider his course of action...} Nc6 {The most flexible response. 4...e6 or 4...d6 are both acceptable, but commit to a structure earlier and may lead to different developmental approaches for white. 4...Nc6 is completely sound and leaves nearly every line of Morra defense on the table.} 5. Nf3 e6 6. Bc4 a6 {A crucial move for black. Often times when black does not make this simple move, black can get mowed down with Nb5 which enters quickly on the dark squares. It is logical to stop it as soon as possible.} 7. O-O {It is wise and necessary to castle early as white in the Morra. Keeping the king exposed can and will cost you your attack on many occasions. Plus, who doesn't want to use the h1 rook as soon as possible? Actually, as you'll see later in this game: not me. But king safety is nice.} Nge7 {And now we see the variation Black has committed to. Although most Morra variations are without a name due to the rarity of the opening, this response is the Grandmaster approved choice employed by many top GMs including Hikaru Nakamura and Loek van Wely. Black's goal is simple: it is too early to commit the dark squared bishop to a square, the light squared bishop may enjoy a post on b7 or potentially d7 or other squares on the diagonal should it open. Black wants to commit the knight to g6, where it stops white from thrusting e4-e5 with a bind on the dark squares and white's light squared bishop from coming to f4. Often times one or both knights end up crossing the e5 square as a transition square or outpost.  Admittedly, black confessed after the game that they had been testing this opening through blitz and had little formal repertoire with this line, but that in no way diminishes the potency of the opening itself. Also admittedly, this is often times white's least comfortable variation of the Morra accepted, perhaps only second to the classical main line.  Black is also fine in other lines should they choose to first develop the dark squared bishop, however then white can opt for e5 or Bf4 should he choose, among other heinous deeds.} 8. Bg5 {Necessary. This move provokes a pawn move as black cannot develop properly otherwise, which in turn creates potential future weaknesses around black's king. Plus, it's annoying.   Protip: Play as many annoying moves as you can as long as they are sound. Just don't lose points that way. Then you're the one who's annoyed.} f6 {The more common response. 8...h6 is completely acceptable as well, but is less preferred since often times white's bishop ends up on g3: the diagonal black had hoped to keep it off with Nge7-g6. Plus, f6 supports a future knight on e5, and stops a white knight or pawn from romping on in.  White: "Tickle tickle."  Black: "Stahp."} 9. Be3 {Having fulfilled its duty of provoking f6, the bishop returns to the pleasant e3 square, targeting the weakened pawn structure on black's queenside.} Ng6 {Preferable is 9...b5, however this move transposes as long as b5 is played next. But only as long as.} 10. Bb3 {Critical maneuver of this variation: white drops back the bishop as not to be harassed by the b7-b5 thrust. White aims to potentially sacrifice a piece on d5: a make-or-break theme of the Morra, however 3 things interfere with this plan: 1. Black having a pawn on d6 2. Black harassing an unprotected bishop on c4 and 3. Black's king being closer than 2 moves from castling. In this position, Bb3 fulfills the final restriction, preparing to open pandora's box with Nd5!} Be7 {?! Dubious. Black ignores the idea of Nd5 and instead moves the bishop to an innocuous square. This move does little to help black aside from preparing to castle, which would prevent Nd5, except that after having played f6 the king will simply be stranded in the center or be forced to return the piece to castle anyways. 10...b5 is absolutely necessary, gaining space on the queenside to seek counterplay against a knight sac, in fact, 10...b5 is the only move in book. However, discouraged by the thought of black castling in only 1 move, I did not sacrifice on d5 yet, first playing the solid 2nd move (and only inaccuracy/mistake of the game on my part).} 11. Rc1 {!? Inaccurate, but solid. This move does less to help in the attack than a sac would, however it does place the a1 rook on the optimal square and prime the cannons for Nd5 upon castling kingside.  White lets Black get away with dropping the soap, but only for a moment. You need to build the suspense, you see.} O-O {?! Black, likely unaware of the dangers of Nd5 ignores the threat and carries on. Remember kids, Get Castled and Carry On is not always a good idea. } 12. Nd5 {! White immediately threatens 13. Bb6 Qe8 14. Nc7, winning the rook, and if 12...Rb8 then 13. Bb6 works quite well again after 13...Qe8 14. Bc7 Ra8 15. Nb6 Ra7 with a positional bind and a lasting attack. Black, despite being left with one option (to take), spent 45 minutes on this move, perhaps sensing that something had gone quite wrong and searching for a way out or perhaps simply out of angst, trying to calculate their next few moves beforehand. Either way, to me it's a free time advantage, and with 28 moves to go before the SD kicks in time is a precious commodity, especially in a thick position like this.  White: "Mmhmm. Now I'll tell you what, I like you, and I want you. Now, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way: the choice is yours. What's it gonna be?"} exd5 13. exd5 {Completely forced. All other moves simply lose the knight for the sake of a meaningless check.  Basically, all other captures besides exd5 drop YOUR soap.} Na5 {? The first mistake (or perhaps blunder) of the game. Instead of addressing the threat of the discovered check appropriately with 13...Kh8, Black seeks to trade off the knight for the light squared sniper. However, as they will soon find out, Kh8 was not only recommended, but necessary, and the knight on c6 may have been more valuable than they thought.   Black: "You and I won't be doing anything any kind of way."} 14. d6+ Nxb3 15. Qxb3+ {A critical move order. 15. dxe7 while regaining the piece allows 15...Qxe7 16. Qxb3+ Qf7 which neutralizes white's initiative and entire attack instantly. Now, the reason for Kh8 is revealed.} Rf7 {Forced, otherwise 15...Kh8 16. Bb6 would force black into the line 16...Qe8 17. Rfe1 with severe lasting pressure and no immediate need to regain the piece. This is the hidden reason behind the necessity for Kh8 earlier: if 13...Kh8 then 14. d6! Re8!? 15. Qd5!? and Black cannot retreat the bishop lest he be mated, and will be forced to take on d6 with 15...Bxd6, only to be met with an outpost for white with 16. Qxd6 Qe7 17. Bc5! where black is miserable and worse, although not lost (yet).  Back to 15...Rf7, this move obviously creates a pin, however this pin is more valuable than it may seem immediately.} 16. Bb6 {White: "Yeah okay, I see you're choosing the hard way."} Qf8 {Of course not 16...Qe8? 17. Rfe1, defeating the purpose of dodging that line.} 17. dxe7 Nxe7 18. Rc7 {! Computer-esque. Had I not been a Morra fanatic and lover of positional binds, I'd have never found such a silly looking move. The rook, although doing little at the moment creates potential lateral pressure along the 7th rank, thus ruling out a d-pawn move for a while. The rook threatens future tactics, such as potentially trapping the bishop on its starting square or capturing a knight on c6 for a deflection. Now black must answer the question: what is your plan to get through or out of this mess? The sad answer is nothing.  White: "Having fun black?"  Black: "No."  White: "Good."} Kh8 {Unpinning.} 19. Bc5 {More pinning. And probing.} Qg8 {Unpinning, but at the cost of activity.} 20. Nd2 {!! Possibly the most beautiful move of the game. Completely ignoring the rules of development, the knight maneuvers to enter the game via c4-b6 or e4-d6. Meanwhile, it eliminates any back-rank counter-play for black in the future by allowing Nf1. And lastly, it is still unclear whether the rook will simply go to e1, or to a different square as the case may or may not turn out. And all the while, black has no means to free himself from his torment.} Nc6 {A fine move, but as it turns out black's knight may very well be the only active piece in his whole position. The rook and bishop on the queenside are completely hemmed in, the rook on f7 is stuck thanks to the bishop on c5, the back rank is still weak and the queen on g8 still has no means of escape. Black's only chance of survival is likely sacrificing the d-pawn. If you recall on move 13, I mentioned that the knight on c6 which was traded for the b3 bishop may have been positionally inappropriate. That knight would have been highly valuable here, but to black's credit the bishop on b3 would be a monster here too.} 21. Bd6 {What was black's only chance of survival again? Now the bind lasts eternally, unless black intentionally loses faster to try his chances at some counter-play.  White: "Hey, black! Do you like that pawn on d7?"  Black: "..."  White: "Well, I do!"} b5 {? Losing immediately. Black reaches for fighting chances, but white snatches them all away with the next move.  Black: "Okay, get this guy out of here."} 22. Rc1 {! The subtle point of Nd2 is revealed: the rook no longer wastes a turn on e1 as most computers initially recommend. From c1 the rook immediately threatens 23. R1xc6! where the pawn cannot recapture due to 23...dxc6? 24. Qxf7 and the queens will be traded and the black king will be lonely and miserable. 21...b5 also prepares the option of Ra8-a7, which now fails to the comical 22...Ra7? 23. Rxa7 Nxa7 24. Rc7! and the pain returns, threatening both Rxa7 and Rxc8 which are unstoppable in unison. 22...Nd4 is a fabulous way to lose quickly after 23. Rxc8! picks up either a piece or a rook for the queen exchange. 22...Rb8 fails to 23. R7xc6 winning the knight and threatening the rook on b8. Meanwhile, Black's bishop on c8, rook on a8, rook on f7, and queen on g8 are all still spectators. Black is forcibly losing a piece here, but as humans do black chooses the line with the most spectacular unforeseen finish...  White: "Don't make me ruin that position Black. I'm a warrior!"} Na5 {Black: "Now you must repeat with 22. Qb4 Nc6 or accept the 2 pieces for the rook and pawn with 22. Qd5 Bb7 23. Rxb7 Nxb7 24. Qxb7 where I finally have a playable game! Where's your attack now, white?"  White: "Here."} 23. Qxf7 {Black: "Oh."  1-0   A nice little gem amongst the 20-move theoretical draws of the Expert section. This game was submitted for the best game prize (update on that later). Hope you enjoyed the game, and if you have any questions feel free to ask away, I know I didn't cover all the lines, just most of the important ones.  24...Qxf7 25. Rxc8+ Qg8 (25...Rxc8?! 26. Rxc8+ leads into the same endgame minus the rook for both sides) 26. Rxg8+ Kxg8 27. Rc7 with an easily won endgame for white, and easily lost for black.  And lastly, in case you didn't get the nonsensical prison humor, it is referencing perhaps one of the funniest series of all times: The Boondocks. If you are mature enough to handle adult humor, I highly recommend it, but no-can-do for the kiddies (I still love the kiddies).  "I still love the kiddies." - CheapShotFail, 2015  ...  Let's end this before it gets too out of hand. Thanks if you've read through this banter XD}
