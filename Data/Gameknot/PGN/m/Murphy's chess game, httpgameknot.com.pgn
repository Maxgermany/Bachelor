1. e4 {(b) The primary cause of all White's subsequent difficulties. } Nh6 2. Nh3 Rg8 3. Rg1 Nc6 4. Nc3 Ne5 5. Nd5 {(c) Apparently nothing better, bad as this is. } Rh8 6. Rh1 Nc6 7. Nc3 Ng8 8. Nb1 Nb8 {(d) An ingenious and beautiful début, sometimes called the Pipeopener. } 9. Ng1 e6 10. f3 {(e) Ill-judged. } Ne7 11. Ne2 Ng6 12. g4 Be7 13. Ng3 d6 14. Be2 Qd7 15. d3 Kd8 {(f) Never seen in the Café de la Régence, seldom in Simpson's Divan. } 16. Qd2 Qe8 17. Kd1 Nd7 18. Nc3 {(g) The flag of distress. } Rb8 19. Rb1 Nb6 20. Na4 Bd7 21. b3 Rg8 22. Rg1 Kc8 {(h) Exquisitely played. } 23. Bb2 Qf8 24. Kc1 Be8 25. Bc3 {(i) It is difficult to imagine a more deplorable situation than poor White's at this point. } Nh8 26. b4 Bd8 27. Qh6 {(j) The ingenuity of despair. } Na8 {(k) Black has now an irresistible game. } 28. Qf6 Ng6 29. Be5 Be7 30. Nc5 {(l) High praise is due to White for the pertinacity with which he struggles to lose a piece. } Kd8 {(m) At this point Mr Endon, without as much as 'j'adoube,' turned his King and Queen's Rook upside down, in which position they remained for the rest of the game. } 31. Nf1 {(n) A coup de repos long overdue. } Bd7 32. Kb2 Rh8 33. Kb3 Bc8 34. Ka4 Qe8+ {(o) Mr. Endon not crying 'Check!,' nor otherwise giving the slightest indication that he was alive to having attacked the King of his opponent, or rather vis-à-vis, Murphy was absolved, in accordance with Law 18, from attending to it. But this would have been to admit that the salute was adventitious. } 35. Ka5 Nb6 36. Bf4 Nd7 37. Qc3 Ra8 38. Na6 {(p) No words can express the torment of mind that goaded White to this abject offensive. } Bf8 39. Kb5 Ne7 40. Ka5 Nb8 41. Qc6 Ng8 42. Kb5 Ke7 {(q) The termination of this solitaire is very beautifully played by Mr. Endon. } 43. Ka5 Qd8 {(r) Further solicitation would be frivolous and vexatious, and Murphy, with fool's mate in his soul, retires. }
