1. e4 {King Pawn Opening} e5 {Black answer symetrically in the center} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {Three Knights Opening.... } f5 {Black is playing the King's gambit.. If I trade pawn, black next move maybe Nf6 or d6 to open the bishop and preparing to take the f5 pawn} 4. Bc4 Nd4 {During the game, I got confuse in his move.. I dont know which I will take... but i think the e5 pawn bcoz no one guarded it.. } 5. Nxe5 {I realize now that is a mistake} Qg5 {I found out this is a trap.. The blackburn gambit... A very dangerous move... I can be mate.. queen take g2 then my rook and checkmate but during that time } 6. Nf7 {double fork} Qxg2 7. Rf1 {I realize that blackburn gambit is not effective bcoz of Nc3.. if there is no Nc3, the move will be Qg2xe4 then white bishop in e2 then move the horse in f3 and checkmate} fxe4 8. d3 {Youy're getting curious why I didn't yet take the rook... Usually this is the final game in our competition and even I lose I am no 1 in the rank with 10 wins and no lose.. this is a round robin.. taking the rook will broke my plan... } exd3 {I think my plan almost 10 minutes..} 9. Bd5 Qh3 10. Bg5 {I am starting to develop my piece} c6 {Black wanted my bishop to move} 11. Bc4 b5 12. Qd2 {I will sacrifice my queen} Nf3+ 13. Kd1 {Double Fork} Nxd2 14. Nxb5 {My opponent can't believe in this move} Qxf1+ {He think that I already lost hope bcoz of my crazy move} 15. Kxd2 Qxa1 {I can't believe he don't know my plan} 16. Nc7# {Checkmate.. After the game, I won the competition..}
