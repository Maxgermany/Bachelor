[Opening "King's Indian (E81), Saemisch, 5...O-O"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {King's Indian, opening which is a bit more risk taker opening than for example Queen's Gambit Declined or the Queen's Indian when meeting 1.d4. The idea of King's Indian is to battle for the initiative right from the start and not just reacting to the opponents threats. You can come out on top if white gets lured by over-extending and also launching a counter-attack is blacks idea. It is not a big surprise that dynamic player like Kasparov used this opening during his career.} 5. f3 {So white decided to go for S채misch variation. This is true King of the hill variation as for example: Tal, Spassky, Karpov, Kasparov, Kramnik, have all played the S채misch and they all are World Champions. So the idea of 5.f3 is to defend e4 securing stable centre and due this white can attack on kingside, lets say: Be3, Qd2, Bh6, g2-g4, h2-h4, can be used to carry out this plan. White can also attack on the queenside so S채misch can be called as a flexible variation. Also, Be3 can be played without worrying about ...Ng4. Well, okay, everyone can agree that knight on g1 seems to be on wrong square at the moment so S채misch has drawbacks and kingside development is rather clumsy. } O-O 6. Nge2 {This has recently popped out again and it seems to be just change of move order. The knight on g1 wants to get out anyway and white usually just plays Be3 or Bg5 transposing into the main lines.} Nbd7 {This is one of the moves which I personally prefer. Lets say 6...Nc6 7.Bg5 and 6...e5 Bg5 have been slightly in White's favour. Books give 6...c5 as a reliable reply here and mention 6...a6!?(which I don't fully understand why) stated as flexible move. I would say the flexible one is to play 6...Nbd7 as white is going to show next is he going to play Bg5 or Be3. When 6...a6!? doesn't seem to have any very good reason to be played but after 6...Nbd7 you can't play knight to c6(then again, white can't drive it away with d5).} 7. Be3 {So white decides to go for 7.Be3. Bg5 ideas were not considered very much in the past until it was found out that Be3 doesn't really do anything to prevent c7-c5. By playing Bg5 white plays bishop on more active square and black plays h7-h6 in some variations to drive it away. We would need to go deeper in King's Indian and go through many variations to show the differences between these two so lets continue with the game. 7.Be3 protects d4 whereas in Bg5 lines white may lack that protection of d4.} c5 {In King's Indian, black plays e7-e5 or c7-c5 at some point if dream of counterplay shall be taken as possibility(that is what you want to do and not to just stay still while hoping for miracles). } 8. Qd2 {Opening up long-castle possibility and maybe trade bishops in some cases by playing Bh6. 8.d5 Qa5 8. Qd2 Ne5 favours black and after 8.dxc5 Nxc5 9.Nd4 Ne6 black is doing just fine. } Qa5 {This is rare move here. It was in my head that 8...a6?! is possible and played here but then again why I would go for a move which I don't understand. What is exactly ...a6?! doing in this position as it seems to be waiting move only. If black is going to play ...b5 then it will be played anyway without preparing the move ...a6?!. So I was just thinking that I move Queen here as white surely doesn't want to castle queenside and meet the move ...b5 with a strong attack. If white tries to get hold on the kingside then Queen can jump there in some variations by doing knight maneuver to e6 aswell so that Queen won't be caught there.} 9. O-O-O {?! This asks for trouble. Looks more like a computer move than something which human would play. White could have just played 9.dxc5 or 9.Nc1 which have been played earlier or maybe even interesting idea g2-g4, Bg7, 0-0, and surely black wont be the one attacking. Examples: [9. Nc1 cxd4 10. Bxd4 a6 11. Nb3 Qd8 12. Be2 b6 13. O-O Re8 14. Rfd1 Bf8 15. Nd5 Nh5 16. Be3 e6 17. Nc3 Qc7 18. Rac1 Bb7 19. Qe1 Rac8 20. Qf2 Ba8 21. Rd2 Qb8 22. Rcd1 Ng7 23. f4 Red8 (Ree,H (2500)-Andersson,U (2545), Wijk aan Zee 1978, ended in a draw).] [9. dxc5 dxc5 10. Nc1 Rd8 11. Nb3 Qc7 12. Nb5 Qb6 13. O-O-O Rf8 14. Be2 a6 15. Nc3 Qc7 16. g4 b5 17. g5 Ne8 18. Nd5 Qe5 19. Na5 Qd6 20. Nc6 Kh8 21. Ndxe7 Qc7 22. Nxc8 Rxc8 23. Qxd7 Qxc6 (Tomescu,V (2447)-Aldrovandi,C (2414), Taormina 2003, led into whites victory).] } b5 {I found it a bit funny that in here has been played 9...Re8, which surely doesn't question whites long caslte. 8...b5 makes much more sense. Example game from the 9...Re8: [9... Re8 10. Kb1 a6 11. Nc1 Qc7 12. d5 Rb8 13. a4 e6 14. dxe6 Rxe6 15. Nd3 Re8 16. Nf4 Bf8 17. g4 Rd8 18. g5 Ne8 19. Be2 Ne5 20. Nfd5 Qc6 21. h4 Be6 22. h5 Bxd5 23. cxd5 Qc7 24. f4 (Evans,L-Mednis,E, New York 1963, led into whites victory).]} 10. cxb5 {Whites takes what is given. } Nb6 {More firepower towards queenside. } 11. b3 {So white got scared under the attack. He decided to carry move to stop b-file attacks and not let knight to go c4 forking queen and bishop. 11.Kb1 seems alternative as 11.dxc5 is crazy stuff, as after 11...Nc4 and queen moves but after that 12...Qb4 seems very dangerous! } c4 {Putting up more pressure. } 12. Kb1 {Of course not 12.bxc4??, as 12...Nxc4 drops the bishop due the fact that 13.Qd3? Qa3+! leads into mate. } Be6 {?! Better would have been 12...cxb3 13.axb3 Qb4 14.Nc1 a5 15.Qb2 a4 16.bxa4 Qxb2+ 17.Kxb2 Be6 and black is doing good. But I wanted to encourage white to play 13.d5 here.} 13. d5 {Okay, this looks natural here but is actually bad choice. White should play 13.Qb2! and white simply seems to keep advantage in every variation, for example: 13.Qb2! cxb3 14.axb3 Qb4 15.Nc1 Nc8 16.g4 Rb8 17.h4 h5 18.g5 Ne8 and white is better.} cxb3 {Now it is all different, this position seems much harder for white as he needs to find right the move. } 14. dxe6 {?! White has let it slip away. 14.Bxb6! would be the right choice, for example: 14.Bxb6 axb6 15.dxe6 fxe6 16.Qb2 bxa2+ 17.Qxa2 Qb4+ 18.Qb2, seems equal. Even that taking the knight on b6 with a bishop seems like something you wouldn't like as it opens a-file.} Nc4 15. exf7+ {15.Qd3 seems to lead into transposition of the game after 15...Qb4 16.Rd2 b2. } Rxf7 {I am not sure why. My old notes says that: "This is based on playing by intuition and possibly doubling rooks after moving e-pawn. Rook can jump to affect queenside after e-pawn is moved and keeps doubling as possibility. Just in case, which most likely doesn't happen, rook keeps f-file in control so no tempo is lost from moving king out of the way. If something happens then white can't do any nasty checks either." But seriously, is this really that much better than just taking with king. Well, maybe I should trust my younger intuition!} 16. Qd3 Qb4 {This is actually really nice tactical play as white ends up trading his queen for knight.} 17. Rd2 {Protecting the pawn. 17.a4 will be met with 17...Rc8.  } b2 {After 17...bxa2+ white is safe if 18. Kxa2 Qa3+ 19.Kb1 Qb3+ 20.Kc1 Rx8 21.Rc2 and white has his king in better safety. Now threatening mate with ...Na3. } 18. Nd1 Na3+ 19. Qxa3 Qxa3 {White had to exchange his queen and now he seems to be going down. } 20. Nd4 {White can't just wait and do nothing for example: 20.g4 Rc8! wins for black and after 20.Rc2 Nxe4! 21.fxe4 Qd3 black is winning. So this is reasonable move protecting squares around white king, opening the line for light-squared bishop and moving knight to better square. } a6 {?! Here I missed the strongest move due tactical blindness(I am usually strong with tactics), 20...Nxe4! 21.fxe4 Bxd4 22.Bxd4 Rc8 23.Nxb2 e5 would be the best. } 21. b6 {Understandable, white doesn't want to open the a-file. } Nd7 {Trying to improve piece placement and attacking b-pawn. } 22. Nc6 {Now in here white could have played 22.Rd3!? Qc5 23.Ne6 Qc6 24.Nxg7 taking the strong bishop away which would have been very good plan. 22.Ne6 straight away doesn't work cause 22...Rc8 is too strong so white has to play 23.Nc7 Nxb6 24.Bxb6 Qb4.} e6 {Opening up the line for f-rook to join the game and basically luring white to play b7 which is bad plan here. } 23. b7 {This is already looking bad for white. So now he just starts to collapse by making bad moves from here on.} Raf8 24. Bd4 {24.Rc2, would fight longer after, 24...Nb8 25.Nd4 d5 26.Rc3 Qd6 27.exd5 Rxb7 28.Bc4 exd5 29. Bb3, but white is still losing. } Bxd4 25. Rxd4 Nc5 26. b8=Q {This is not helping anything. } Rxb8 27. Nxb8 Nb3 {! Now it is over but this move is true beauty! 28.axb3 Qa1+ leads into mate.} 28. Rd3 { } Rc7 {Now white resigned. The attack is going through and white will be mated. This is a good example that even if white would have had chances to play stronger defence and keeping the advantage it is often really hard to defend under the pressure. In this final position whites pieces are just sitting ducks. White simply went for too hazardous option by long castle and then wasn't able to put up the strongest defence.}
