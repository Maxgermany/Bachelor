[Opening "Reti (A07), King's Indian attack, Yugoslav variation"]

1. Nf3 {Another unfamiliar opening.} d5 2. g3 Nf6 {Since White is going for a fianchetto, I decided to reinforce my d5 pawn.} 3. Bg2 Nc6 {Trying to control the centre.} 4. O-O e5 5. d3 Bc5 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Bg5 Be6 {Reinforcing the pawn again.} 8. Nd2 {I didn't see this at first, but Nd2 opens the way for the White bishop at g2 to attack the d5 pawn.} h6 {This move was really just chasing the bishop to where it wanted to go.} 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. Nxd5 {And I lose a pawn.} Bxd5 {The knight was too powerful in the centre, so I traded for it with my bishop.} 11. Bxd5 Rad8 12. Bg2 Qg6 {Here, I was probably thinking of advancing my f pawn.} 13. Ne4 {Moving his knight out while attacking my bishop.} Bb6 {Retreating my bishop along the g1-a7 diagonal to keep the pressure on White's king.} 14. Nc3 f5 {Continuing with my plan to attack along the kingside, although this move leaves my king vulnerable to check.} 15. Nd5 e4 {Cuts off protection from White's knight while advancing the pawn. If 16. dxe4 fxe4, White is left in a bad position with his knight pinned to the queen and Black's rook on f8 attacking the f pawn.} 16. Nf4 Qe8 {I needed to get my queen out of danger while still defending e4.} 17. c3 {Getting ready to check with Qb3.} g5 {I wanted to get the knight out of the way so that I could continue with 18. ... f4.} 18. Qb3+ {An intermediate move that I missed. I was thinking that his knight would run to h3.} Rf7 {Moving the king would have been safer. I can't remember why I decided to move the rook.} 19. Nd5 {At the time, I thought White was merely getting his knight out of danger, but I missed something important.} f4 {Continuing with the plan to expose White's king. That bishop on g2 is too irritating.} 20. Nf6+ {I almost resigned here, when I saw the fork. As soon as White moved this, I realised that my rook was still pinned to the king. However, I felt that I still had a fighting chance with my pawns, so I decided to continue playing.} Kf8 {I had to move the king to g7 or f8 so that I could continue to protect my f7 rook after my queen was taken. However, I didn't move my king to g7 because I didn't want White's knight to take my queen and check me.} 21. Nxe8 {Ouch.} f3 {If I had moved 20. ... Kg7 21. Nxe8+ Rxe8, then White could have rendered my attack ineffective with 22. f3.} 22. exf3 exf3 23. Bh3 Rxe8 {Now that the pawns are settled, I can take the knight and control the open e-file at the same time.} 24. Rfe1 {Trying to challenge my dominance of the e-file.} Re2 {Making good use of my advanced f pawn.} 25. Rxe2 {I'm not sure if this was the best move for White here, since it lets me have a passed pawn and allows my remaining rook to attack White's pawn on f2.} fxe2 {Now White has to defend the e1 square.} 26. Qxf7+ {White exchanges his queen for my rook, effectively destroying Black's options of attacking.} Kxf7 27. d4 {White advances his pawn to d4, thinking that it would cause my bishop to be less effective. Also, my knight cannot move to e5 now. However, would have been better to make the that Black's passed pawn is taken care of with Bg4 or Re1.} Nxd4 {A free pawn for Black! With this move, Black can now trade his knight and the passed pawn for White's rook. The resulting endgame would be bishops of opposing colours. If 28. cxd4, then 28. ... Ba4, and the promoting square is defended. Other possibilities: 28. Re1? Nf3+ 29. Kg2 Nxe1 30. Bg4, or 28. Bg4 Nc2, attacking White's rook and defending the promoting square.}
