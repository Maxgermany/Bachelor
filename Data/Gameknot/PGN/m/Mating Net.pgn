1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {This is unusual but playable. Black hopes to either get favorable variations of an Alekhine Defense type game or to be able to play an early ...d5 in one move.} 3. Nc3 {A sound, developing choice, if e5 instead, the resulting complications favor the higher rated player.} Nc6 {Best, 3...d5 has been proven to be premature. But now Black does threaten ...d5.} 4. Bb5 {A good, developing move. Deters ...d5.} Qc7 {Best. 4...Nd5 leads to complications that offer white good chances.} 5. Nd5 {A good move, still deterring an early ...d5.} Nxd5 6. exd5 Nb4 {Best. Black gains time attacking the d pawn.} 7. O-O {?! Here White goes astray. There is not enough compensation for giving up the pawn because Black has a solid position.} Nxd5 8. d4 {White is opening up lines of attack.} cxd4 {Consistent although a little risky. } 9. Nxd4 {Qxd4 developing the Q would be more consistent and I think slightly stronger, but this is ok. } e6 {Black's plan becomes evident. Develop and then use the central pawns to fend off attacks.} 10. c4 {A good move. White drives the N back and deters d5.} Nf6 11. Bg5 Be7 {This is the position Black sees as defensible. White has an edge in development but limited targets.} 12. Qc2 {?! Opposing Queens opens up the possibility of tactics and hampers the LSB retreat. Better was Qe2 and Rc1 .} a6 {Now is the time to drive the bishop back.} 13. Ba4 O-O {Black castles and is now prepared to start undermining White's position.} 14. g3 {?! My lower rated opponent sees that he could play Bf4 if the pawn protects the bishop. But a more skilled player does not create holes around the K unnecessarily. This move actually contributes to the final mating net. Here if Bf4, e5! anyway. So better was Rc1.} d5 {Finally...d5 in one move! Black has freed his position and is a pawn to the good.} 15. b3 {?! This move supports the c pawn but blocks the bishop's retreat. } h6 {Put the question to the Bishop. } 16. Bf4 {?? White overlooks ..e5. I expected Be3.} e5 {Of course...} 17. Be3 exd4 18. Bxd4 {Black is now a full piece ahead. But how to exploit that?} Bh3 {This move is a luxury Black can afford. The idea is that an unopposed check on the Black rank or a Q move to f3 is fatal.} 19. Rfe1 Bb4 {Attacks the Rook and opens the e file to rook exchanges.} 20. Be5 {Counterattacks the Queen.} Qd8 {Black retreats, but being a piece up is more interested in finding a way in.} 21. Red1 {This threatens BxN, QxB, exd (Rxd??, QxR+)} Rc8 {Blocks that possibility by pinning the Q.} 22. Qd3 {? This exchange does not favor White who is already behind in material. Better was Qb2. } dxc4 23. Qxd8 Rfxd8 24. Rxd8+ {? Another error. White gives Black a rook on the 7th rank.} Rxd8 25. bxc4 Rd2 {Exactly. White is in trouble.} 26. Rb1 {? This move is weak because of back rank threats.} Bc5 {Setting the trap,} 27. Rxb7 {? This loses quickly. Can you see the forced mate?} Rxf2 {Of course, threatens Rf1#.} 28. Rb8+ {Spite checks.} Kh7 29. Rb1 {At least preventing Rf1#...} Rf1# {But no, it is still checkmate, because this is a double check. White's weakening of the King proved fatal.}
