[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 Nf6 {This is kmccrate541's characteristic move in the French Defence.  Probably White's best response to this is to transform the game into a species of Alekhine's Defence and play 3.e5.  In the sequel, Black keeps a level pegging.  More usual is to contest the centre at once by 2...d5.} 3. Bd3 {White has a huge range of options, here.  This early development of the bishop makes sense: aiming along the most accessible diagonal towards the K-side.} c5 {Good: striking at the centre whilst the d-pawn is lacking protection.} 4. c3 Nc6 {A bit of a battle is now raging about d4, and indeed the centre in general.  } 5. Nf3 d6 {Also worth thinking about was 5...d5.} 6. dxc5 {White is happy to exchange on c5 now, as the f8-bishop can no longer recapture.} d5 {(?!) Probably better was simply to retake on c5.  This pawn advance has its points, but it leads after the ensuing melee into Black's first big mistake.} 7. e5 {(!?) Also coming into consideration was 7.exd5.  After 7...Nd7 Black will get his pawn back.} Ng4 {(?!) Risky!  This has the same idea as ...Nd7 - hitting the e-pawn, and possibly Black hoped that something interesting might develop at f2 after ...Bc5 in the near future.  But this could have gone awry...} 8. O-O {Overlooking 8.Qa4! - striking at the Knight on g4, at the same time indirectly protecting the e-pawn (8...N(g)xe5  9.Nxe5, winning a Knight).   The Knight's only retreat (...h5; h3) is ...Nh6.  If, then, 8...Nh6  9.Bxh6 gxh6 leaves Black's K-side looking rather ragged.  The advanced White e-pawn, meanwhile, remains to impose a cramp on Black's game.} Ncxe5 {More solid was to take with the other Knight.  Capturing this way had another implication, which soon came apparent, to Black's cost.} 9. Bf4 {Good response: developing and attacking at the same time.} Nxd3 {That gets rid of one of White's menacing bishops at any rate!} 10. Qxd3 Bxc5 {(??) And here it is.  This capture has been in the air for several moves, and Black obviously had it in mind ever since he played 6...d5.  Had he retaken on e5 with his other knight (8...Ngxe5) this recapture would have been fine.  As it is...} 11. Qb5+ {Winning the Bishop.} Bd7 12. Qxc5 {The consequences of this is for Black much greater than the the loss of a piece for a pawn.  For the moment, Black can't castle, and his bishop is a very poor minor piece (one of the down-sides of the French Defence is the so-called 'French Bishop' - blocked in by pawns).  Black never does succeed in improving its prospects.} h6 {Not the most auspicious response to calamity.  Instead 12...b6 would have freed the Queen's Rook to move to c8.} 13. Re1 {(!) There's more to this than meets the eye!} b6 {(?) An understandable slip, but neither side were alert to the opportunity that was now presented to White.  Essential was 13...Nf6.} 14. Qd4 {(?)  Missing 14.Qxd5!  The e-pawn is pinned.} O-O {(?) However desirable, this was not yet quite playable.  Again, 14...Nf6 was indicated.  The reason, however, was not White's next move!} 15. Bxh6 {(??)  White must have counted himself very fortunate afterwards that he got away with this.  The irony is that he could right here have extended his material advantage by 15.Bd6! (One suspects his intuition was telling him there was something good in the position, but he lit on 16.Bxh6 whilst trying to identify what this 'good thing' was).  By 15.Bd6 White attacks a rook and discovers an attack on the knight at the same time.  Black can complicate by 15...e5, but 16.Qxd5 Re8  17.Nxe5 costs Black 2 pawns.  Now Black can recover the piece and obtain a level game...} gxh6 {(??) The most common mistakes overlook retrograde moves, usually by a bishop.  On this occasion, it's a knight's retrograde that gets overlooked.  By 15...Nxh6 Black would have equalized the game.  After this, it is all downhill, pretty much, try as Black might to get counter-play.} 16. Qxg4+ Kh7 17. Re5 f5 {Preventing the rook sliding over to the K-side.} 18. Qb4 {Aiming for d6.  There is no good way of stopping this.  Nominally, White is up a minor piece (two knights for a bishop).  True, his Q-side has yet to be mobilized, but that's just potential not yet tapped.  Contrast Black's Bishop - hemmed in by friendly pawns, with no prospects either, being committed to the protection of the backward e-pawn.} Qf6 19. Nbd2 Rfg8 {Hoping something good will turn up on the g-file.  Given that the bishop can not possibly participate in this attack, Black is effectively two pieces behind in the ensuing game.} 20. Rae1 Rg4 {Doubling rooks with gain of tempo?} 21. Qd6 Rd8 {No.  But Black might have been better advised not to commit this rook in this way, and found other ways to protect his bishop.  Unfortunately even the better 21...Qg7 won't save Black: 21...Qg7  22.g3 (well, it achieves this much - White has to make a defensive move!) 22... f4  23.Rxe6! Bxe6  24.Rxe6 ... (White now threatens 25.Re7)  24...Rg6  25.Rxg6 Qxg6  26.Qxf4.  With 2 Knights and 2 pawns for a rook, White should have no trouble taking out the game.} 22. Rxf5 {(!) A tactical shot wins more material.  The e-pawn is pinned, and 22...Qxf5;  23.Qe7ch picks up the rook at d8.} Qg6 {But this doesn't help, either.} 23. Qe7+ Qg7 24. Rf7 {The Queen is now lost.} Rxg2+ {Black's high water mark.  He has no way to reinforce this attack.} 25. Kh1 Rg8 {Better - however hopeless - was 25...Qxf7, which would have contained the damage to the major exchange (queen for rook).  Now a bishop gets carried off as well.} 26. Qxd7 {(!) White doesn't miss the chance.} Qxf7 27. Qxf7+ Rg2g7 28. Qxe6 {From here on Black has no worthwhile play at all.} a5 29. Re5 b5 30. Rh5 Rg7g6 31. Ng5+ {Efficiently wrapping up the game.} Kh8 32. Rxh6+ Rxh6 {32...Kg7 resisted for one move longer.} 33. Qxh6# {I would not call this a game of missed opportunities: most were taken all right.  After Black missed his chance to equalise, White never allowed him the slightest chance to get back into the game.  An object lesson in being alert to changes in the flow of the game; but also in how to win a winning game.}
