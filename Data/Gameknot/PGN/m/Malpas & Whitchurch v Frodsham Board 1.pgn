1. e4 {He starts classically.} c5 {I opt for the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 {He plays the main line.} Nc6 {And I do likewise.} 3. d4 {He goes for the open variation.} cxd4 {So I take.} 4. Nxd4 {He takes back.} Nf6 {I hit his e pawn.} 5. Nc3 {He protects.} d6 {This is a very normal position.} 6. Bg5 {The Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack (ECO codes B60 et seq). The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter's invention, threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable.} e6 {I prevent him doubling my pawns.} 7. Qd2 {This is usual development for white. Vsevolod Rauzer introduced the modern plan of Qd2 and 0-0-0 in the 1930s. } a6 {Usual again, preventing a white knight from coming to b5 and also preparing b7-b5.} 8. O-O-O {He continues with his plan.} Bd7 {Protecting Nc6, so preparing b7-b5.} 9. Nb3 {This is an interesting move. If now Be7 10. Bxf6 and if I take back with the bishop my pawn on d6 falls. So I decided to continue with my queen-side play.} b5 {I am now threatening b5-b4 and after Nc3 moves, I can play Nf6xe4 and if he plays Bg5xQd8 then I have Ne4xQd2.} 10. f3 {So he protects against that threat. Now one of my team mates said he thought f3 was a bit passive, but in fact accoridng to my on-line opening databases, it is the most popular move in this position.} Rc8 {10.... Rc8 doesn't seem to be in my opening databases, but it seems to me to be a fairly logical follow-up to my previous play.} 11. g4 {This was also criticised by my team mate as being too passive, but this sort of move is often played in this variation.} Ne5 {I attack f3.} 12. Bg2 {Now this move I think is a mistake. My knight now gets into c4 and it seems very powerful there. Perhaps Be2 was better.} Be7 {Now if 13.	Bxf6	Bxf6 14. Qxd6 Nc4, attacking his queen on d6, and after it moves, I have 15....Nxb2 and if 16. Kxb2 I have Bxc3 check} 13. h4 {So he carries on with his pawn of advancing his king side pawns. My play on the queen-side seems more dangerous.} Nc4 {I hit his queen.} 14. Qe2 {Queen moves.} Qc7 {I am now threatening to take on b2 and then on c3. If he protects c3 with 15. Bd2, then I have b4 16. Nb1	Nxb2 17.	Kxb2	Qxc2+ 18.	Ka1	Nxg4 and if he takes my knight then Be7-f6 check is killing. } 15. Rd3 {So he protects c3 another way.} b4 {But now his knight comes under fire.} 16. Nd1 {Knight retreats.} Bb5 {With horrible threats....} 17. Nd4 {White finds the best defence, but it drops rook for knight and pawn.} Ne5 {With threats to the rook.} 18. Nxb5 {He takes the bishop.} Nxd3+ {I take the rook with check.} 19. Qxd3 {He takes.} axb5 {I take the knight.} 20. Qxb5+ {He takes the pawn with check. I was tempted to offer the exchange of queens, as I am materially ahead, but I figured his king was still vulnerable with the queens on.} Nd7 {I am threatening mate on c2.} 21. Ne3 {So he protects.} Bxg5 {I take the bishop. I thought taking back with the pawn was best, with pressure down the half-open h file, but I think this position is still better for black.} 22. Qxg5 {But he took back this way.} O-O {And I eventually castle.} 23. Rd1 {He develops his rook.} Rca8 {I hit his a pawn.} 24. f4 {He advances again on the king-side.} Rfc8 {I like this move, renewing the possible threat on c2 again - so his Ne3 can't move.} 25. f5 {He advances again.} f6 {I drive the queen back.} 26. Qf4 {She retreats.} e5 {I hit it again.} 27. Qf2 {Queen retreats again.} Rxa2 {And I finally gets round to taking the a pawn.} 28. Bf1 {Bishop comes round to a better diagonal. } Nb6 {I stop his bishop coming to c4.} 29. g5 {Another king-side pawn advance, but what else can he do?} Kh8 {I stop any counter-play down the g file.} 30. gxf6 {He takes.} gxf6 {I take back.} 31. h5 {he is still hopeful of something on the king-side.} b3 {Threatening to take on c2.} 32. c3 {He tries to stop by queen-side play. STOP! What do you think black plays now?} Qxc3+ {Did you find this dear reader?} 33. bxc3 {So he takes.} Rxf2 {I take back.} 34. Nd5 {Knight comes in. White is lost now. Can you find the mate in 5 from here? http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=158556} b2+ {Did you find this move?} 35. Kb1 {Forced!} Ra8 {And, as there is no satisfactory, long-term defence against Ra8-a1, white resigned. Many thanks for reading! Please leave a comment or two and rate it on the start system. Until next time dear reader!}
