1. c4 {10 minute clock - I play white and decide on the english, my best white attack.} d6 2. Nc3 a6 3. Nf3 h6 4. d4 Bf5 5. e4 Bh7 6. g3 {I think we're well off the book line English by now, but I'm still thinking Bg2 and castling king side at some point.} Nf6 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Be3 Nb4 9. a3 {Forcing the issue...} Nxd3+ 10. Qxd3 e6 11. b4 c6 {I liked pushing forward with the pawn group. I think castling or better knight development would have been better but I felt comfortable with the initiative I seem to have} 12. c5 a5 13. b5 {His little rook trap is now gone, I push knowing that I'll end up with a nice little knight outpost and a possible king/rook fork if he's not paying attention...} cxb5 14. Qxb5+ {Changed my mind, this feels like a mistake that I gave up protection of the e4 pawn. Black never takes advantage of this.} Qd7 15. Qxd7+ Nxd7 16. cxd6 Bxd6 17. e5 Be7 18. d5 {I've never been so pawn happy, but black never took up a defense of his center so I kept the pawn push up defended by the knights.} exd5 19. Nxd5 {c7 maybe?} Rc8 20. Nxe7 {No fork, at least with the game about to open up, I snag a bishop and force him to give up on castling.} Kxe7 21. O-O {I need both rooks out now.} Rhe8 22. Rab1 {Blunder - I was totally clock watching. I was originally thinking moving the rook to c and just changed up at the last second. I almost quit right here.} Bxb1 23. Rxb1 Kf8 24. Rxb7 Rca8 {Blunder on his end, I feel a little better now.} 25. Rxd7 a4 26. Bc5+ Kg8 27. h4 g6 28. g4 Kg7 29. g5 {Another mistake on my part - I feel like I should have brought my king up.} hxg5 30. Nxg5 Ra5 31. Bd4 Kg8 32. Nxf7 {More free material - I'm down a rook but up 2 pawns and a knight!!!} Rb5 33. Nd6 {This is where moving my King up would have really paid off.} Rb1+ 34. Kg2 Re6 35. Nf7 Rd1 36. Ng5 Rxe5 37. Bxe5 {Anything to get rid of one of his rooks} Rxd7 38. f4 {Clocks starting to get close, I think we were both coming up on under 1:30. Another mistake, I should have put my king in the game pushing him up.} Rd3 39. Bb2 {ACK! Another blunder!!! Rd2 and it's over!!!} Rb3 {OMFG!!! My opponent must be clock watching now too.} 40. Bf6 Rxa3 41. h5 gxh5 42. f5 Rb3 43. Be5 a3 44. f6 Re3 45. f7+ {I might actually pull this off!!!} Kf8 46. Bd6+ {LOVE this move. I force his rook to protect, His king can't move. Just me vs the clock now. Both of us at a minute.} Re7 47. Bxa3 h4 48. Bxe7+ Kxe7 49. Kh3 Kf6 50. f8=Q+ Kxg5 51. Qh8 {Black Resigns... Not a pretty game but a lot of fun.}
