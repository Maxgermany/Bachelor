1. e4 d6 2. d4 {If your opponent allows free, unmolested movement of a 2nd centred pawn, why, in the name of all that is Holy, don't you 'abuse' such gifts?} Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {The Pirc Defence, with the ..} 4. f4 {"Austrain Attack" in reply. White is aiming for a central pawn clamp; Black's trying to demolish such grandiose ideas.} Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O {Aiming to get the Black King to safety before he commences the dismantling of the 3 Stooges taking centre stage.} 6. Be3 {6.Bd3 is also a viable development move here.} b6 {Unexpected. I was expecting the usual 6...c5 here, sniping at the centred pawns immediately.} 7. Qd2 {Q-side castling and in line with the Austrian Attack's premises.} c5 {All the same; Black skirmishes the flank of White's centre, a standard method of operations in the Pirc Defence to dismantle White's proud annoyance.} 8. dxc5 bxc5 {Capturing TOWARDS the centre is usually a good idea. 2 Stooges left.} 9. O-O-O {Neither colours enjoy a significant advantage yet from this position.} Nc6 10. e5 {The centre is ordered by Duke Wellington to join battle and disrupt Black's smooth operations.} Ng4 {A standard maneuvre here, exposing e5 to 4 attacking Black units. Black does not want to exchange Queens with 10...dxe5, 11.Qxd8 yet, trying to keep some tension in the middlegame.} 11. Bg1 {Preserving my e3 Bishop. I did not like the looks of instead 11.exd6 Nxe3 12. Qxe3 dxe6.  White's centre pawns is no more (=> success for Black's strategy) and Black, in turn, has now his own 2 centre pawns to steamroller at an opportune moment.} Bh6 {Black complicates the game with this h6 Bishop sortie and occupies a potentially dangerous c1-h6 diagonal, pinning the f4 Stooge against White's King + Queen and thus preventing the f4 pawn to defend his central buddy on e5.  MINEFIELD #1: Note that Black cannot win a pawn with 11...dxe5, 12.Qxd8 Rxd8, 13.Rxd8+ Nxd8 as the simple 14.h3 regains the pawn with roughly equal further chances.} 12. exd6 {Only decent option, as Black is [MINEFIELD #2] threatening 12...Ngxe5 and the f4 pawn cannot retake, the very idea of Black's 11...Bh6 earlier.} Qxd6 13. Qxd6 {Seems the only move to keep some initiative for White...} exd6 14. Ng5 {This blocks the c1-h6 diagonal and protects the last remaining f4 Stooge, as well as putting some evil White designs onto the d6 pawn. (MINEFIELD #3: Obviously 14.Rxd6 was not a sane option.) } Rd8 {Black develops and protects his backward weakness.} 15. Nce4 {Adding more attackers to d6, and supporting his namesake. Now Black cannot play 15...d5 as 16.Nxc5 snatches a pawn without any danger for White.} f6 {With hindsight, an error, but it is admittedly hard to recommend a viable alternative for Black. f6 allows  ........ } 16. Bc4+ {....the White-squared Bishop to smoothly join the attack. } Kg7 {Here (1) 16 ... d5 fails to Rxd5, (2) 16...Kh8 fails to 17.Nf7+ and upon (3) 16...Kf8 White's 17th move reply would also have been ....} 17. h3 {.... 17.h3. This move required some cool-head and accurate calculations if White does not want to lose the plot.   17.h3, apart from counterstriking the g4 knight, also intends opening up the h-file for the dormant Rook on h1. } fxg5 {Black does the expected and lances the knight off his warhorse.} 18. hxg4 {Opening up the h-file, but White, planning move 17.h3 had to reckon with the following Black Bishop sortie .....} Bxg4 {MINEFIELD #4: ... Bg4 attacks a piece of greater value, putting the game on a knife's edge as 19.Rxd6 gxf4! gives the following unsatisfactory White play: (a) 20.Rxc6 Rd1# Mate!! and (b) 20.Bxc5 f3+! 21.Rxh6 Kxh6, 22.Be3+ Kg7 23.Rxc6 fxg2 and Black equalizes + no material advantage for White, justifying the power of Black's dangerous ...Bh6 earlier in the game.} 19. fxg5 {White, for the moment, is on top of the position as Black's reply 19...Bxg5+, 20.Nxg5 Bxd1, allows the nasty fork 21.Ne6+!  This pesky knight ensures -- after the forced further exchanges of Rook and Bishop on d8/d1 respectively -- that White stays 2 pawns up with an excellent position, so Black tried ...} Bxd1 {...the d1 rook capture giving him a tempory +5 advantage.} 20. gxh6+ {I *did* say 'temporarily.' Black is though still +2 pawns up. The h1 Rook is doing its intended duty by protecting the pesky little 'un on h6. } Kh8 21. Bd5 {ACHTUNG! MINEFIELD #5: White has to be awake, as the natural looking 21.Kxd1 recapture allows 21...d5, saving Black. Bd5 stymies this idea, as well as pinning the c6 knight to the rook.} Bxc2 {The Bishop sells his life as dear as possible.} 22. Ng5 {A powerful move. Despite being -3 pawns down, this knight sorty threatens the murderous Nf7+/Nxd8+/Nxc6 sequence regaining all the deficit material... and then some.} Rdf8 {Black defends f7 and has the sly idea [MINEFIELD #6] to exchange his f8 rook and gain some upper hand thus:--  23.Nf7+ Rxf7, 24.Bxf7 Rf8 and despite White being a pawn up, the position is quite drawish with no clear win in sight for White.} 23. Bxc6 {White gains parity of material and attacks at same time the a8 Rook + Black's c2 Bishop, thus keeping the initiative.} Rac8 {Black Counter attack's. Thrust and counter thrust.} 24. Bd5 {By simply returning to the a2-g8 diagonal, White hems the Black King in the corner and renews the capture of the c2 Bishop. BLACK RESIGNED HERE, realising after withdrawing his c2 Bishop White replies Nf7+ and apart from winning the exhange, the endgame is hopeless for Black. Notice how the h6 pawn, in covering the King's g7 escape square, now in turn stands on the very same square Black introduced complications with ...Bh6 earlier. }
