1. d4 d5 2. e3 e6 {at this moment, better black defense whould be Bf5, or Kc6 in order to move e5 and break from the biginnig the wall. I think that he did not realize from the biginnig that he will fight a stonewall.} 3. Bd3 Nf6 4. f4 {here we go, so now there is no doubt, it will be a stonewall attack, hight rated player should know how to manage with it !} c5 {this is a way, but not the worst for white ...} 5. c3 {defending d4} Nc6 {pressuring D4} 6. Nf3 {going on whith the stonewall} cxd4 {ok, first initiative. I'm playing from about one year the stonewall, and before i whould play cxd4, that i think now is a mistake : exd4 is realy better !} 7. exd4 {i whould even say that black attack c5xD4 is a mistake, because it give me the opportunity to open the DSB} Bd6 {there is no danger whith that. DSB is protecting it, then the rook after castle, and anyway my knight will go to e5 and if black exchange it, it will close the center (fxe5)} 8. O-O O-O 9. Ne5 Qc7 10. Qe1 {in order to protect e5 and to go to h colon (classical theat mate on h7, can give me tempo in default to mate...)} Nd7 {black are going to move f6 to mmove the e5 knight. But i have a plan : Qh4 !} 11. Qh4 {easy ! so if black move F6, there is mate on h7. So they wont, i they will have to manage with my bloody queen !} g6 {defending, black are not so good know, what do you thing about it ?} 12. Be3 {in order to developp my b kniht} Be7 {this will help me ! because i have nothing great to do for the moment if i leave the queen there, better if she moves on g colon...} 13. Qg3 f6 {this is the mistake, in my opinion. Whould you did it ?} 14. Nxg6 {this sacrifice was expected apparently ...} hxg6 {this was not the best move. now mate is coming. heshould accept to loose his rook, andmaybe he could counterattack taking the oportunity of the g colon opened ? Whould you find a better plan for blacks ?} 15. Qxg6+ {this is the end, black resign (and dont ask for remacht...)}
