1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Nc3 d5 {Switching gears and keeping me guessing.....I assumed the d6 KID line was coming. What to do, what to do........} 5. cxd5 {As my opponent is an unknown (I don't even know his rating at this point), I really don't know which way to go. I choose to open the c file as quickly as possible so I can play Rc1.} Nxd5 6. e4 Nb6 {?! An unnatural square for this knight, but solid all the same. I was really anticipating 6...NxN.} 7. Be3 O-O 8. Be2 c6 {Black gets a Slav-type pawn in, and I start pondering his development chances on the queenside. I'm thinking he is going to have to spend some time to establish well positioned pieces, so I'm content to just keep developing although I have no real plan as of yet.} 9. O-O Nb8d7 10. Rc1 {As planned. Qd2 next connecting my rooks and it's time to start pressing.} e5 {!? My brain begins hurting. No way am I going to help him develop by taking, and I can live with the position should he instigate. I really did think 10...Nf6 was coming.} 11. Qd2 exd4 12. Nxd4 Qc7 {I have a nice long think here. 13. Nb5! only appears threatening, but after 13...Qd8 14. Nd6 Nf6 then what?} 13. Bh6 {Justifying my Qd2, and attempting to trade a decent bishop for a strong bishop.} Qe5 14. Bxg7 Qxg7 {?! In post game analysis, my opponent shared his thoughts with me that he was anticipating a pawn storm, and wanted to back up his pawn defenders with his strongest piece. While a valid concern, IMHO it seemed a little slow, and was just begging to be punished. I'm really digging my position now, as I'm ripped and ready with great activity while my opponent stills lags in development.} 15. f4 Nf6 16. f5 {I go ahead and start attacking in earnest before black gets a chance to get caught up in development.} Kh8 {Black sees the g file opening up in the near future, and makes a pre-emptive defensive move.} 17. e5 {?! Seeking to establish a long term presence deep in black's camp. It was only after I made the move did I realize that 17...Ne4 gives me a whole slew of headaches.} Nfd5 {Either he didn't see it or he didn't appreciate it. Pretty sure I dodged a bullet there.} 18. f6 Qg8 {Black is feeling cramped, and I start thinking uber aggressive thoughts. I'm calculating all kinds of sacs against his castled position, but first things first - pile on as much pressure as possible before pulling the trigger.} 19. Qg5 Re8 20. Bf3 Be6 21. Be4 {Adding yet another attacker into the fray while anticipating a rook lift then Rg3 or Rh3.} Rad8 {! Nice move - while having somewhat limited options, black picks a winner. The d file is now his, and after about 5 minutes of thinking, I pretty much gave up on even attempting to even make a play for it.} 22. Nce2 {! Holding his mate at d4, revitalizing my Rc1, opening another path for a potential rook lift, and getting yet another piece moving towards the action. A very multi-purpose move.} Qf8 {Getting active and looking to untangle a bit.} 23. a3 h6 24. Qh4 Ne3 {I hadn't really considered this option - and I pay for it. What was once a threatening looking attack starts crumbling a bit.} 25. Rf3 {I get my rook lift in.....} Nbd5 {....but my headache continues. Black now gets his misplaced knight into the mix while exerting a ton of influence in the center of the board.} 26. Rg3 {Still entertaining ideas of a direct assault.} Bg4 {! I've been contemplating eliminating that bishop for the last 6 moves, and now my opportunity is lost. Black trades two minors for a rook, which usually sounds good, but he also picks up my e pawn, and the dominos start falling.} 27. Rxg4 Nxg4 28. Qxg4 Rxe5 29. Nf3 {? Still trying to bring more ammo into the fight before I go nuts and try something crazy. And speaking of crazy, I don't even SEE my f pawn falling like this. I feel physically ill.} Nxf6 {! Has anyone seen my attack? It was here a minute ago.......} 30. Qf4 {Aha!!! A nice rejoinder.} Rxe4 31. Qxf6+ Kh7 32. Nc3 {I considered this knight going to g3 then f5 with some aggressive intent, but then realized that I REALLY need to remove at least one of his rooks asap as I was scared to death of them working together against me. To do that, 32. Nc3 covers d1 (as well as my Nf3 covering e1). Now I just have to be careful and avoid a back row mate, as I see that I can easily step out of the check that I know is coming.} Qc5+ 33. Kh1 Re7 {Getting out of harms way and protecting the vulnerable f pawn.} 34. Re1 {!? Do or die time. I'm down to about 11 minutes on the clock (he has about 25), and know full well that I will need every second in this complicated, unbalanced endgame.} Rxe1+ {Absolutely. If nothing else, I have to make some retreating moves to defend. Black gains tempo and an appreciation for superior clock management skill.} 35. Nxe1 Rf8 {?! Maybe Kg8 here? The rook is now somewhat impotent.} 36. Nf3 {Still worried about some back row nastiness, but I have time to improve this knight first.} Qe3 37. h3 {Escape square.} Kg8 {Attempting now to release to rook from defensive duty.} 38. Ne5 {Honestly, I'm looking for a drawing line after Nxg. I simply cannot afford for his rook to assume an attack posture.} Qd4 {! A very pesky pin I must deal with (All the while, my clock seems to be running at mach speed).} 39. Kh2 {My Nc3 is going to have to get involved, and to do that he must give up covering d1 - so I make a quick pre-emptive move to sidestep the potential check.} g5 {A preamble to Qf4+ QxQ gxQ and a wicked hard endgame for white - I have about 8 minutes left to his 17.} 40. Qf5 {Unpinning and covering the potential check on f4.} Qd6 {? Black has the opportunity to trade queens and chooses not to. Instead, he chooses a healthy (and annoying) pin.  However..........} 41. Ne4 {! I start thinking I may be able to actually win this thing, as I'm allowed to bring all of my pieces to bear.} Qc7 {Getting out of harms way while maintaining the pin, but at what cost?} 42. Nf6+ {! Mate in 3} Kg7 43. Nh5+ {And black resigns (43...Kg8 44. Qf6 any 45. Qg7# OR 43...Kh8 44. Qf6+ Kg8 45. Qg7# OR 43...Kh8 44. Qf6+ Kh7 45. Qg7#). Many thanks to my new friend Windy for the fantastic game, and thanks to all for the Charlotte hospitality. I really enjoyed playing with you guys.}
