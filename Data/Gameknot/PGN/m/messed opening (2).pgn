1. d4 g6 2. e4 Bg7 {In the first game vs. bvarkonyi mentioned above I played 3.c4 and Black answered 3.../c5.  I continued with 4.Be3(?) and after 4.../Qb6 I was already losing a pawn. Black also has positional advantage and so I lost the game quite soon. Thats why I played the opening different this time.  } 3. Be3 c5 4. c3 cxd4 5. cxd4 Nc6 6. Nf3 d5 7. e5 Bg4 8. Be2 f6 {An alternative for Black was to play 8.../e6 with developing the Ng8 to e7. Now Black threatens to win a pawn, but if White plays 9.ef, Black has a comfortable game after 9.../Nxf6. When I was looking for an alternative it became clear to me, that I could ignore this "threat" because of a resource in the 12. round.} 9. Nc3 fxe5 {An alternative for Black was 9.../Nh6 (10.Qd2/Nf7) but Black accepted the sacrifice. } 10. dxe5 Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Bxe2 12. Qa4+ {This was the reason for I had ignored the pawn loss. After this move the development of the black pieces is disturbed for his king is stuck in the center. If Black plays 12.../Kf8 he loses a piece after 13.Qf4+. } b5 13. Nxb5 Bxb5 {If Black plays 13.../Bxe5, he is losing material for after 14.Nc7+/Kf7 15.Nxa8/Bc4 16.Qxa7 the Na8 is protected. (16.../d4 17.Rd1 and then Nb6 -- 16.../Bxb2 17.Rb1/Bc3+ 18.Bd2)} 14. Qxb5+ Kf8 15. Nd3 Rb8 16. Qa4 a5 17. Qf4+ Ke8 {If 17.../Bf6 or Nf6, White continues with Bd4 and Ne5.} 18. O-O Nf6 19. Rad1 Ne4 20. f3 Nd6 {If 20.../Rf8, White continues with Qh4 and if the Knight returns to f6, 21.Ne5 can follow.  } 21. Qa4+ Kf7 22. Qf4+ Ke8 23. Ne5 Bxe5 {If Black plays 23.../Rf8, White answers 24.Qa4+ and then Rxd5 and if 23.../Qc7, 24.Rxd5 follows.} 24. Qxe5 Rf8 25. Qxd5 Rxb2 {If Black plays 25.../Rf5, White answers with Qg8+.} 26. Rfe1 {Now all white pieces join the attack. } Qc7 {If 26.../Rb5, White plays Qc6+ and then Rxd6 winning a piece -- 26.../Rb8 27.Bh6 and White threatens to play Qxd6 -- after 26.../Rf5 White continues with 27.Qe6 threatening Rxd6. } 27. Bh6 Qb6+ {Black wants to set up some counterplay, but White does not have to worry about this. The position of the black king is too weak. } 28. Kh1 Qf2 {There is no sufficient defense anymore: if 28.../Rf6, White plays Qe5 -- if 28.../Nf5, White does not take the rook immediately, but plays 29.Qa8+/Qb8 30.Qc6+/Kf7 31.Qd5+/Ke8 first and now Bxf8 and Qxa5 setting up the next threat (Rd8+). After the game move Black is mated. } 29. Rxe7+ Kxe7 30. Qxd6+ Kf7 31. Qxf8+ Ke6 32. Rd6+ Ke5 33. Qf4# {}
