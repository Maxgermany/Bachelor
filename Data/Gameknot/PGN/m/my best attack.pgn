1. e4 {Great move played by many great players. (Fischer)} e5 {Although I play a lot of Sicilian, it always hurts my heart to cancel a good-old open game. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {...here preferred to 3.Bb5 - leading to the not so open Spanish game} Nf6 {counter-attacking the central pawn, here preferred to the safer 3...h3, preventing the following ...} 4. Ng5 {with direct attack on the weak f7 pawn.} d5 5. exd5 Na5 {I like this variation as it is aggressive. Black sacrifices a pawn in attempt to grab the initiative and speed the development of his light pieces.} 6. d3 {not the usual 6.Bb5  but rather building a strong pawn center.} h6 { the knight  already  means no threat at g5 and appears to be the weakest link in White's positioning of pieces.} 7. Nf3 e4 {the essence of the attack. 8.dxe4 is certainly not possible here.} 8. Qe2 {White blocks the danger by pinning black's king.} Nxc4 {My distant knight on the "a" for his white-square bishop looked to me like the best deal in this position.} 9. dxc4 Bc5 {The development of that bishop has been the greatest dilemma of my exhistance. 9...Bd6 with attack on h2 and blocking the aggressive d pawn also looks solid. Here I considered that king-side castling was the best white could get from his position, where Bc5 would pretty much justify itself.} 10. Nfd2 {The position here looks as good as even. Black has a more active play as a compensation for the lost pawn. For his undeveloped queen side, white has a double center pawns and chances of counter-play through Nb3 and Nc3.} O-O {castling in the opening - whenever possible - is an indisputable rule for me and my opponent here. However, in his case it may not have been the wisest of choices.} 11. O-O {my opponent certainly didn't like the idea of  rook at e8.} Bg4 {strong move, but exclaim would not be proper here as this attack appears natural. The bishop is coming to pick up the fruits of White's blocked position.} 12. Qe1 {not too many options, are there?} Re8 {securing my strongest weapon - the "e" pawn, that pretty much solved the game.} 13. Nb3 {natural move for white unleashing the bishop on c1 and counter attacking queen side.} Qd6 {realizing the importance of the diagonal held by my bishop, the fatality of 13...Bb6, and the shame of 13...Bd6/e7} 14. Be3 {Here we had to free ourselves from the DB and start thinking. White had a strong  counter-play and after the exchange of active pieces I saw my advantage vanishing.} b6 {ugly but saving move.} 15. Nxc5 bxc5 16. Nc3 Nd7 {I had plans for my knight that included e5 and queen going on g6.} 17. Nb5 {attacking through my clumsy pawn structure.} Qg6 {and if 18.Nxc7 =>18... Bf3. Followed by Qg4 white chose safety playing...} 18. Bf4 {...to block danger with Bg3 and put more pressure into his queen-side attack.} Ne5 {I just had to put more pieces into the attack. exchange of the bishop for my knight probably didn't feel good for white. so he played...} 19. Nxc7 {? disregarding the danger...} Nf3+ {! - Yes, its a royal fork! } 20. gxf3 Bxf3+ 21. Bg3 {doesn't save him here, and after...} Qg4 {White resigned as after 22....Qh3 no escape from checkmate is possible.  Hope you enjoyed as much as I did. :)}
