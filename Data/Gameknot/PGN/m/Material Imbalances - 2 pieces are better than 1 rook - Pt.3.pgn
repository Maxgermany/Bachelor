1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is another game involving 2 bishops v 1 rook.  I had the rook and you've guessed it, I lost.  Here is how the action unfolded.  Jim kicks off with 1. e4.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {3. d4 - this is the Scotch Game.  Next move will transpose into a kind of Goring Gambit which I accept.} exd4 4. c3 dxc3 5. Bc4 cxb2 6. Bxb2 {6. Bxb2 - at last, the pawn that started on e7 has finally been captured on b2, all in the space of 6 moves!} Bb4+ {6. ........ Bb4+ - development.} 7. Nc3 d6 8. Qc2 Qe7 9. O-O-O Bxc3 10. Qxc3 {10. Qxc3 - B for N trade.} f6 11. Rhe1 Bd7 12. Kb1 {12. Kb1 - I think I should have responded with 0-0-0, instead I decide to try and swap off more material with Ne5?.  Slap on the wrist for timewasting there jstevens1!} Ne5 13. Bb3 Bc6 {13. ...... Bc6 - maybe I should have ignored the WQ's attack on c7 and traded knights.} 14. Nd4 O-O-O 15. f4 {14. f4 - I must consent to my castled position being broken up or lose a piece.  In fact I do not actually lose a piece.  As I am 2 pawns up I get 3 pawns for the piece.  The first material imbalance but here it will favour white.} Bd7 16. fxe5 fxe5 17. Nf5 {17. Ne5 - nasty nasty, I decide to trade Fou Leblanc for the horsie.} Bxf5 18. exf5 Nf6 {18. ....... Nf6 - this knight develops at last.} 19. Be6+ Kb8 {19. ....... Kb8 - forced.} 20. Qb4 Nd7 {20 ...... Nd7 - heading for b6 but doesn't get there because I considered Nc5 to be a better option.  That move precipitates a pseudo sac.} 21. Rdc1 Nc5 22. Rxe5 dxe5 {22. ........ dxe5 - white has traded rook for pawn but there is more to come.  My knight is now en prise on c5.  White now trades queens.} 23. Qxc5 Qxc5 24. Rxc5 {24. Rxc5 - now after the dust has settled we are in an endgame where white has 2 bishops for a rook and 2 pawns.  White's pieces are very powerful.  I give Jim a spite check on d1.} Rd1+ 25. Kc2 Rhd8 {25. ..... Rhd8 - defending his colleague.} 26. Bxe5 Rd8d2+ {26. ....... Rd8d2+ - an attempt at counterplay but to no avail.} 27. Kb3 Rb1+ 28. Kc3 Rxg2 {28. ....... Rxg2 - taking a pawn but white wraps things up very nicely.} 29. Bxc7+ Ka8 {29. ........ Ka8 - Henry is forced into the corner.} 30. Bf4 {30.  Bf4 - threatening Rc8#.} a6 {30. ....... a6 - giving Henry some luft but Jim's next move puts me in white flag territory.  Bd3 threatens a deadly discovery resulting in the loss of the rook on b1.  I therefore resigned the game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Well played Jim, Part 4 coming up.} 31. Be3 {}
