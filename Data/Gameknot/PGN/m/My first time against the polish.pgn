1. b4 {the polish or sokolsky opening} e5 {establishing a hold on the center} 2. Bb2 {offers to trade the pawn on b4 for the pawn on e5} d6 {in retrospect, i should really have traded and then continued develping, but this isnt so bad} 3. e3 {preparing a push to d4} Bf5 {developing, aiming at the queenside} 4. Qf3 {attacks the bishop and the pawn on b7} Bxc2 {i decide to open the game up and possibly trap his queen in the corner} 5. Qxb7 Nd7 {develops the knight to its only safe square, protects the rook and stops the queen from check on c6} 6. Bb5 {threatens Bxd7 either opening the king, or winning a rook if i blunder} Ngf6 {protects the knight} 7. a3 {not too sure about what this move accomplishes} Rb8 {the queen is almost trapped, if he takes the pawn then 8. Be4 basically wins the queen for a rook} 8. Bxd7+ {trading, "winning a pawn"} Nxd7 9. Qxa7 Be4 {the queen needs to retreat along the a file} 10. f3 {terrible mistake, after 10. Ra8 the queen is sunk} Ra8 11. Qxa8 {getting a rook at least, also opens the queenside for later attacks} Bxa8 {taking with the queen isnt bad, as it opens up his kingside, but i was playing conservatively} 12. Ne2 {developing, preparing to castle} g6 {preparing to bring the bishop out and castle} 13. O-O Bh6 14. Nbc3 Nf6 {bringing the attack to the kingside} 15. a4 {trying to establish a pawn queening threat down the side of the board} O-O 16. b5 {continues to push pawns, making me a little nervous} Nd5 17. a5 Nb4 {attempting to stop those annoying pawns} 18. a6 Nc2 {attacks a defender of the pawns} 19. Ra4 {bring the rook to safety, maintaining the pawns, and trapping my knight} Nxe3 {i decide to trade the knight for 2 pawns and postion} 20. dxe3 Bxe3+ 21. Kh1 Qh4 {for some reason, neither of us noticed that my queen was hanging, lucky for me} 22. Ba3 Bf4 {saving the queen} 23. g3 {looks devastating, but the queen can sidestep and attack the rook} Qh3 24. Rf2 Be3 {while Rh4 does trap the queen...} 25. Rh4 Bxf2 {!!! he resigns because if rook takes then 26. Bxf3#, else, 26. Qe1  followed by 27. Ng1 and 27. Qxg1#}
