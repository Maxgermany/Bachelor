1. c4 {This is my game against my first 1300. It was very hard. I must say well done to him as he played very well.} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bc5 5. Nxe5 {The fork trick.} Bxf2+ {This is actually quite a good response to the fork trick in c4. This sadly is not very good against e4 fork tricks.} 6. Kxf2 Nxe5 7. e4 {! Planning a good centre in the future.} Qe7 8. d4 Neg4+ 9. Kg2 d6 10. h3 Nh6 11. Be2 {?} Bd7 {? Why didn't he take on e4?} 12. Bf3 O-O-O 13. Re1 {! Lining up on his queen.} Nhg8 {? I don't get why he played this.} 14. e5 {! breaking through the centre.} dxe5 15. Rxe5 {if I were to have played dxe5??, Bxh3+ would be completely winning for black.} Qb4 {Obviously if he played 15...Qxe5?? 16.dxe5 Bxh3+ 17.Kxh3 Rxd1 18.Nxd1 he would lose a piece.} 16. Qb3 {! Tries to open up a file onto his queenside.} Qxb3 17. axb3 a6 18. Bf4 {! applying more pressure to his queenside.} Ne8 19. Nb5 {!! The killer blow. If he takes the knight, Ra8 is checkmate.} Bxb5 {The only logical move.} 20. cxb5 axb5 {?? This allows me to win a rook. Better I think, was Rxd4. I still would have been winning, but not by a whole rook.} 21. Ra8+ Kd7 22. Bg4+ {!! By the way, Rd5+ would have also won, but this is better. Sadly, he resigned here. I hope you liked this game. When I finish another game ( even if I lose!!!) I will annotate it as soon as possible ( this means hopefully quite soon.) Bye!}
