1. h4 {?! Remembering those private annotations combined with what I previously taught my students, I said, I'm not sure why you played this, but it's said to be a wing pawn. A wing pawn is a pawn at the end file. In general, however, it's preferred to develop, so either a central pawn which is one the e or d file, or develop a minor piece (The Knight or Bishop). The goal is to develop, get the King to safety (castle), and control the center which is right in the center of the board. Advancing the wing pawn doesn't do that.  } e5 {So, I go with my mainline, what how I respond when my students play 1.h4.} 2. e4 {Now, he starts the first process as this is a center pawn, as noted, which opens up a line for his Bf1.} Nf6 {Meanwhile, I continue with my development.} 3. Bc4 {So, does Magnus.  But, I said ? It's good that you remembered my advice about developing pieces. But, an important thing to learn is that there are exceptions to the General Opening Priniciples. Sometimes, you've got to deviate. This happens when a piece or pawn are en-prise (unprotected). The problem is that this move is going to lose a pawn. Better was 3.Nc3, 3.f3, d3, or 3.Qe2. 3.Nc3 is, I think, the best move as not only do your protect, but at the same time, a different piece has been developed.  This time, however, I admit to being wrong.  In this context, I was coming up with a bunch of variations, as to how I won a pawn.  It's important to note that, although I abhor it, in the past, I've, occassionally, given my students the wrong information.  I'd go into variations but not enough.  So, that I wasn't calculating enough.  This was espeically noticeable in one of their annotations.  In fact, it's one of the reasons why one of them got deleted due to having been corrected so many times.  This time, I did the opposite and calculated too much which, to my surprise, lead to an inaccuracy since he gets the pawn back.  The lesson I learned is knowing the happy medium when providing the student with variations.  If you don't do enough, there are other things that I've missed.  But, too much, and there's something that I miscalculated.} Nxe4 4. Nf3 {It actually starts off with this move.  Now, this game, including the move played, happened before receiving advise from bhidragon.  In fact, it was before my first game against oddlord.  So, I hyperfocused on those chess terms, as opposed to, thinking about the context of the game, and seeing the big picture.  That means, thinking about what the board is telling me.  Although it wasn't as bad this game, make no mistake that it led to some losses.  And, after being told what's needed to improve even more, I gave some of that information to Magnus since I noticed similarities, as we'll see later on.} Bc5 {Although I'm still a little hyperfocused on those terms, or as we call, chess quotes, I play this.  But, in this position, there was more to it.  The other idea behind this is that I have threats against his Rh1, as the danger is, with my bishop aligned, a Knight fork which would win a Rook.} 5. Nxe5 {And, this is where he wins back the pawn.  But, there's more to it then meets the eye.  Magnus is also threatening a fork.} Qf6 {Believe it or not, this move happened, at about, the same time that I recieved that advice.  Otherwise, I would've been hyperfocused on bringing my Nb6 into play.  Right after he told me how to change my thought process, I considered 5...Qe7, with the idea that if he were to take on f7, I'd take back.  The problem is that this would lose my Queen.  So, while analyzing, that also changed.  I was, really thinking about what to do.  The reason behind this move is due to the added threat on f2.  In addition, should Magnus play 6.Nxf7, I'll respond by castling, or playing 6.Rf8, to create a threat against his Knight.  In fact, he'd be forced to give up his Rook to avoid mate as 6.f3 is the only thing that would refute me from playing 6...Qxf2#  And, after 6.f3, I'd answer with, as you might guess, 6...Nxf2} 6. O-O {?? But, Magnus castled, instead.  So, I said, it's good that you detected the threat. But, the problem with this move is that your Ne5 is left en-prise. By playing this, I win a piece.  After that, I told him that there was only one way to prevent mate and the loss of material.  I attempted to give him Homework with a fen, right after 5...Qf6 by asking if he could find it.  Unfortunately, he could not.  So, I said that best was 6.Ng4, and that way, everything holds.  The idea being is that his N is protected and it prevents my Queen from landing f2.  Now that I can't give him direct, I'll do the equivalent by giving him things to think about, as a mentor does. } Qxe5 7. b3 {?? After this move, I said, I understand why you played this, Carlson. You fianchettoed with the idea of having a nice long diagnol for your Bc1. That would normally be a good move. But, in this position, however, it is a outright blunder. By playing this, your Ra1 is unprotected. Therefore, I get a Rook. Better was 7.Nc3, and after 7...Nxc3, 8.dxc3, Qxc3 you can protect the Rook with 9.Rb1. 7.c3, was also better as it eliminates the threat completely because it prevents my Queen or Knight from landing on or surpassing that square. Best, however, was 7.d3, preventing my N from escaping since that would allow 8.Re1 pinning my Queen, and thus, winning it.  But, to give Magnus something else to think about in case, let's say, his opponent made this kind of blunder, I added, I would not have blundered, but let's say I did and had played 7...Bd6, and you answered with 8.g3, and I answered with 8...Nxg3?? it would work. But, this is another blunder because it'll lose more material.} Qxa1 8. Re1 {?? After this move, I said,  The idea here was to pin the Knight, that's what coming through your mind. But, it's more important to ask yourself how black is going to respond. Therefore, just about any other move was better then this.  And, his response was, "True but if you take B,e1 you would take my rook but then I could use Q,e1 and take your buship. But I don't think there is a way for me to stop you from taking my night with your queen therefor they are defenseless.  Unless I can move my C,3 then move B,d3 then I can block your queen from taking my night"  Therefore, I told him that, In this position, moving your c3 would no longer work. What I was alluding is that I can take your Re1. Sure, you can take back, but I have a Rook for Bishop, in addition to, what I've won.} Bxf2+ 9. Kh2 {?? But, after he played this, I said, The other option was 9...Kh1 Actually, that's what I anticipated. I hate to tell you this, but there's , pretty much no good moves left, at this point. Had you played 9.Kh1, I'd take. But, by moving here, I can hold off on that.  The idea behind this statement is that the Rook is now free, whereas, if I take now, he'll get a bishop, in return.  The idea being is, as kenneth_fiore_3 said, "In chess, you have to be cruel."  I agree with that because linency equals teaching chess in a simpler form, when in reality, it's a complex game.  If you make things more difficult, the student will learn more.} Qe5+ 10. Kh1 {I did not say anything here because Magnus made the right choice.  Had he play 10.Kh3??, I would mated, at once, with 10...Qg3#  It might not seem necessary to add this, but I will be showing this to my student when the annotation is finished.  By seeing this comment, he will learn more of what works and doesn't.  In fact, that, believe it or not, is one of the main reasons that I annotate the training games. } Bxe1 11. Qxe1 {?? But, Magnus took back.  So, in addition to pointing out why this was wrong, I gave my student something else to think about by saying, This, however, was another blunder. Ok, why did I wait to take your Rook? The answer is that had I done it right away, this move would be ok. But, by getting out of check with 10.Kh2?? I was able to place you in check. Once you found the right move, I took. But, the idea is that by taking back, you're going to lose more then just the Rook.  What I'm implying is that had I captured, immediately, he'd get a bishop, in return.  With the delay, the Rook was free, because I recapturing, I'm going to get his Queen and DSB.  Right after this, however, I wasn't going to say anything else because of what ION noted in the fourth training game with knightrider62.  He said that it doesn't pay to be critical when you have a won position.  Although, I sort of disagree with this, I also understand why he'd say that.  In my books, there was always a chance of getting something back, or drawing, such as stalemate, as I've seen with players like TA.  But, once I've won this material, in addition to the Queen, it's game over.  In other words, there's no chance of counterplay.  Interestingly enough, I came somewhat close to missing the next move.  However, after what happened in my second game against dynamic_dv where he won the Queen with a discovered attack that placed me in check, I was able to do the same thing with this student.} Ng3+ 12. Qxg3 Qxg3 13. Kg1 Qe1+ {Right before playing this, I seeing if there was mate.  So, I took game notes, but noticed that Magnus could defend.  This was the game note, If 13...0-0, with the intention to mate, white might be able to defend.  E.g., 14.d3, Re8 15.Bd2, Re2 16.Bd5  But, if I check on e8 and take his Bishop, it will be over, sooner.  In other words, I see a quicker win.  That involved this move, where I grab his Bc1.} 14. Kh2 Qxc1 15. Nc3 {Protecting his N, for now, but as noted earlier, the damage has been done.  In fact, this is where I'd resign.  But, I wasn't going to tell him that because, before mentoring him, he'd resign after losing a pawn.  The idea was to prevent him from getting him back in the habbit.  Plus, if I told my student to resign now, I wouldn't know how to do it without making him feel rushed or stressed.  I personally feel that it should be done, but I don't know how to say it without going too far.  In fact, the only person that said it was safe for me to resign was reversion, and when he said that, I didn't feel stressed.  But, it's knowing how to say that which I'm not good at.  Plus, I feel that staying in a lost game like this, is better then resigning just because you're down a pawn.} Qxd2 16. Ne4 {?? Going after my Queen.  I didn't say anything now, for the reason mentioned earlier, but just before mating him, I said,  after 15...Qxd2, you played 16.Ne4 to attack my Queen. I also know what you were thinking as the idea is that you want to gain tempo by attacking a piece. But, it's important to see the big picture and what's unfolding. And, notify what's really happening on the board, or the threat. Therefore, you overlooked 16...Qf4+, after which, I was going to get your Knight. Best was 16.Nd5, where your Knight would've remained safe. Now, 16...c6?? still appears to win the Knight, but you can win back a pawn and Rook, after 17.Nxc7+ since my King and Rook are forked.} Qf4+ 17. Kh3 {?? In that same message, I said,  Then, after 16...Qf4+, you had two options but played 17.Kh3?? From then on, I wasn't going to take right away as mate was unavoidable. The only move that would've kept you in a little longer was 17.Kh1.   The idea being as, mentioned in the private message is that I will be able to coordinate my Queen and LSB to deliver the mate since they are going to go on the same diagonal.  And, that will start with the next move.  It's also important to note, that just before 18.g4 was played, I came a little close to overlooking the mate I have, and considered taking the Knight right away.  However, I saw the way penelope80 mated duke69 in a training game, and I am going to apply the same concept. The idea being, as noted, is to teach chess in it's most complicated form.  That's when I realized that I could do the same thing, even when he plays 19.Kg2, as opposed to, 20.Kh2, as opposed to, 20.Kg1.} d5+ 18. g4 Bxg4+ 19. Kg2 Qf3+ 20. Kh2 Bh3 21. Bb5+ {Trying to hold off on the mate a little longer by placing me in check.  But, after my next move, white will not hold off much longer.  BTW, I played 21...c6, you would have lasted another with 22.Bf1, Magnus.  But, after 22...Bxf1, I'd still mate on g2.  However, with anything else, including on a4, I mate there, at once.} c6 22. Ba4 Qg2# {Right before I delivered this mate, we had a little conversation.  It was part of what you saw where I mentioned about 16.Ne4??, followed by 17.Kh3??  And, what I said is the moral of the story as it is important for him to remember.  In fact, this is where I applied a little more of what I learned to teach him, as well.  So, during the conversation, he said, "I'm gonna go to bed so good night I'll play tommorow maybe"  Before the other things mentioned, I said, there's no need to wait until tomorrow because it's mate.  But, after the other two moves, I said, where you really went wrong was in the beginning with things that are generally a good move.  For example, castling is usually a good idea but not in that particular position. That's because your Knight was en-prise, so it should've held off, as noted. By castling, where you did, after I took with the Queen, you left a Knight en-prise which I got. Then, you fianchettoed with the idea of bringing a piece into play, with the longest diagnol. This sometimes works but not in the context of our game. The reason why is that you overlooked that the Rook was being attacked. Lastly, after winning a Rook, you played 8.Re1 to pin my Knight and win it back. It sometimes works, but you have to ask yourself if it does so and in that position. You overlooked the Rook and King fork which was, at the very least going to win a Rook for Knight. But, when you played 9.Kh2??, as opposed to, 9.Kh1 it was for free. Shortly after that, you blundered the Queen by overlooking the discovered attack. So, the main moral to this story is not to make a move because it's usually good. Instead, it's important to be weary of all threats made by your opponent. Doing this requires thinking about and analayzing the position carefully and asking yourself how your opponent can respond. That is important, and remembering this moral is what is needed to become a better player.  }
