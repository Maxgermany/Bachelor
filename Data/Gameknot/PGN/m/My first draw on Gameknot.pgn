1. e4 {This was my first draw on gameknot, and a very enjoyable game, even if it had a few significant errors.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Although the Italian game is a very old opening that is still played often, it's not one that I'm particularly familiar with.} Bc5 {The Giuoco Piano, meaning "Quiet Game" although I did not know this at the time. I was aware that the main-line 3... Nf6 could lead to the double-edged 4. Ng5.} 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 {Now White has an impressive-looking pawn-centre and a lead in development. However, this doesn't last long, and Black actually has the better score in both World and Gameknot databases.} d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Ne5 {10. Qb3 and 10. O-O are both much more common. However, 10. Ne5 is very interesting, seeking to reconnect the isolated queen's pawn and get a kingside pawn majority (as occurred in the game-line). 10... Nxd4?! is dangerous because of White's pressure on f7 and, of course, the d-file. 10... Nce7 and 10... O-O are the two moves in the World database.} Nxe5 {Leaving the World database.} 11. dxe5 O-O 12. O-O {Transposing to 11 games in the World database. Now 12... Nb6 is solid but Black can instead attack before completing development.} Nf4 13. Nf3 Bg4 {Black threatens 14... Qxd1 15. Rfxd1 (or Raxd1) Nh3+, damaging White's pawn structure.} 14. Qb3 b5 15. Rfd1 Qc8 16. Qxb5 {Accepting the pawn seems risky, but in this game I (Black) failed to refute it. 16. Bxb5 looks even worse, after 16... Rb8 and 17... a6. In Karatchev vs. Korneev, the only game in either database to reach this position, White played 16. Bf1 and eventually lost.} Nh3+ {16... Rb8 is also worth considering.} 17. gxh3 Bxf3 {Now Black is a pawn down, but has threats on d1, h3 (and indirectly g2), and the b-file after Rb8. 18. Bd5?? fails to 18... c6, as does 18. Rd7 (although White at least gets counterplay). 18. Be2 is the obvious move, but after 18... Qxh3 Bxf3 19. Qxf3, Black seems to be ahead. White found a very interesting alternative, sacrificing the exchange for a pawn and a major piece on the seventh rank.} 18. Qd7 {!? This move certainly threw me, and I became too focussed on the threat to f7 (which lasted for the rest of the game) and repelling White from the 7th rank. No matter how much initiative the opponent has, it is of course essential to be alert to chances for counterplay.} Bxd1 19. Rxd1 Qe8 {19... Qe8 was played with the "threat" of 20... Rd8?? (met by 21. Bxf7+) in mind. However, it's a good move, weakening White' king. After 20. f4, Black can play 20... Qb8 with (e.g.) 21. b3 Qb6+ and a reasonable counterattack.} 20. f4 Kh8 {? Now Black can play Rd8, but White has a move first...} 21. Qxe8 Raxe8 22. Rd7 Kg8 23. Rxc7 g5 {Finally starting some counterplay.} 24. fxg5 {24. Rxa7, obtaining connected passed pawns on the queenside and delaying development of Black's rooks, seems much stronger to me, but Rybka disagrees.} Rxe5 25. h4 {Again turning down the chance for connected passed pawns. From here, activity of Black's rooks is essential. Since the f7 pawn is key, and there is no way that I can see to challenge White's rook on the seventh, this means that Black must control the f-file from in front of the pawn, which also constrains White's king.} a5 26. Kg2 Rf5 {Turning down the h-pawn, because after 26... Re4 27. b3 Rxh4 28. Kg3 (28. Ra7 Rg4+) Re4 29. Kf3, White's king is active, Black's rooks are not, nor do they have any prospect of controlling the f-file.} 27. b3 Rd8 28. Kg3 Rd2 29. a3 Rdf2 {White has to be a little careful here. At the very least, Black threatens perpetual check on the f-file after R5f4.} 30. Bd5 {Giving up a pawn to control some key squares on the long diagonal and de-activate one of Black's rooks.} Ra2 31. Rd7 Rxa3 32. Kg4 Rf2 33. h5 Kf8 {The only move; e.g. 33... Ra1?? 34. Rd8+ Kg7 35. h6+ Kg6 36. Be4+, mating. Still, 33... Kf8 is a good move anyway, getting Black's king off the light squares and breaking the pin on f7, so that Black has opportunities to pin the bishop.} 34. Ra7 Ra1 35. h4 Rg1+ {Returning the pawn to get the rooks to excellent squares} 36. Kh3 Rd1 37. Rxa5 Rd3+ 38. Kg4 Rd4+ 39. Kg3 Rff4 {Now White's king is locked out and the passed pawn has little chance of advancing. Any chances of a win for White depend on the kingside pawns.} 40. Ra8+ Kg7 41. h6+ Kg6 42. Ra6+ {I had expected 42. Rg8+ followed by Rg7, although this still looks drawn.} f6 {Now White must stop Black's rook from getting to g4, or it will be Black that has winning chances.} 43. Bf3 Rfxh4 44. gxf6 Kxh6 45. f7+ Kg7 46. Rf6 Kf8 {The carnage leaves the game as a dead draw. The f7 pawn will never promote, unless Black plays recklessly for the win.} 47. Rf5 Rdb4 48. Bd5 Rhg4+ 49. Kf3 Rg7 50. Rh5 Rxf7+ {A draw was agreed because of 51. Bxf7 Kxf7 52. Rxh7+ Kg6, and after the rook moves, the b3 pawn will fall. Appropriate that the game ended with a capture on f7.}
