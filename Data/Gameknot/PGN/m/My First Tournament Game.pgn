1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. f3 e6 6. Ne2 Nd7 7. Bf4 Ndf6 {7...Ngf6 was also a good choice. But according to my views on that time, I might thought that both moves look like the same.} 8. Ne2g3 Nd5 {I simply declined my decision to play 8...Nxe4 because it would proceed as 9.fxe4 Bg6 10.Be2 would make my bishop useless and white might dominate a strong centre. So I had thought to attack the undefended bishop on f4.} 9. Bd2 h6 {Here I had wished to put 10...Ngf6 followed by Bd6 and O-O. I needed to prevent the annoying pin with Bg5.} 10. Qe2 {What a fantastic move to demolish my intention to move the knight! If I did so, I would lose my bishop or the KING!! Can you see how it happens with 10..Ngf6 11.Nxf4 exf4 12.Nf6# ?} Bg6 11. Be3 Qb6 12. c3 {Here is a glance of my victory by becoming a pawn up at that moment.} Nxe3 13. Qxe3 Qxb2 14. Qc1 {If the rook was moved, the a-pawn will be swapped off. But the instance was still brilliant to me.} Ba3 15. Ne2 {As I think that was not the best possible defend for her. How about 15.Qb1 which would proceed as 15...Bxe4 16.Nxe4 f5 17.Nd2 Qxb1 18.Rxb1 b6 which will remain a one pawn down situation?} Qxc1+ 16. Nxc1 Bxe4 17. fxe4 Bb2 {Here comes my second pawn with a check!!} 18. Rb1 Bxc3+ 19. Ke2 O-O-O {I was making the rook arriving to the battlefield with 20.Rxd4 dominate the d-file after 20.Bxd4.} 20. Nb3 Bxd4 21. g3 Nf6 22. Bg2 Bb6 23. Rhf1 Rd7 {I wished to double my power on d-file and the knight make into action.} 24. Nd2 Rhd8 25. Rb2 Ng4 26. h3 Ne3 27. Rg1 {According to my view, 27.Rf2 was better for her. In that case I would follow with 27...Ng2 28.Rg2 and gain a slower victory than the actual. Anyway can you find my next move?} Nc4 {Which rook for me? She resigns. That was how my first tournament game ended!!!}
