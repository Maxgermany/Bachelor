1. d4 {so i diced to try my best with my prefered opening : wallstone} Nf6 2. e3 b6 3. Bd3 Bb7 {this is one of the most difficult defense for me because it is just cancelliong my wallstone developpement.  I have to change my plans and sincerely, i dont know any good variation from there. Some body advice ?} 4. f3 {this is so poor, i suppose i will be soon destroyed...} d5 {ho ! this is the first agreable surprise of the game ! Sir Navigat cancelled his threat ! Could be a mouse slip ? so i just can go on with my wallstone, with a tempo lost} 5. f4 {here we go !} e6 {classical} 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. O-O Nbd7 8. Nbd2 {this is it ! i dont need to advance the c2 pawn because there is no risk for the moment, so let's see what we can do atacking now...} Ne4 {anticipating, this is good because it has the b7 bishop supporting the attack. So know i understand why the d5 move ... } 9. Ne5 {no matter, let's go on } c5 {attacking the center and trying to destroy my wallstone. Normally i should play c2 c3. But i whant to be more courageous and try some sacrifice to break monotony and to give some surprise to my so hight challenger ...} 10. Nxf7 {he he he ! it will give him some difficulties....} Kxf7 11. f5 {going on whith some agressivity, i dont whant to let him thinking that it will be easy with me !} e5 {refusing or course, the king would have problems} 12. Qh5+ {but here are others problem for discovered blackk king !} Kg8 {Let's analyse the position : black is very strong in the center, but has the h rook locked, and i'm leading nstead of my knight sacrifice. what do you thing about the position ? also, i have a good opotunity exchanging knights : opening the a2g8 diagonal in order to move the king from his stash and exposing him to the g1 rook threat and maybe to a mate with the queen (12. Qh5+ Kg8 13. Nxe4 d5xe4 14. Bc4+! Kf8 15. Qf7++) } 13. Nxe4 Nf6 {blunder ! i will take the knight whith mine in e4 } 14. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {i'm +1 now !!!!!!!!!!! (i'm so happy)} 15. e4 {same kind of plan than before, but no more mate coming ...and maybe a nice move with Bc1 g5...} cxd4 16. Bg5 {interesting but it will force a queen exchange surely} Qf7 {what did i said ?! so now i have nothing better than to accept... what a regret for me, my queen was well placed. But i still have something interesting to play with my f1 rook, the f5 paw and the g5 bishop (some thing like : f5 ...g7xf6 ....Bxf6 and wins the h8 rook !)} 17. Qxf7+ Kxf7 18. f6 {so let's try this one !} g6 {of course, what am I entitled to expect with a 2273 elos player ?!} 19. exd5 {so now i just whant to clear the center, loosing my motivation, the game will finish in ending, fighting to pomote a paw in queen, and at this game i will be surely not enought strong against experimented 2273 elos ... } Bxd5 20. c3 {if d4xc3, b2xd4 and then ....c3 c4 to remove the d5 bishop (always targeting the king...)} e4 21. c4 {agressive response, if e4xd3, 2 pawn will be in colon with is more easy to block} Be6 {blunder ! , i win the e4 pawn and thret the a8 rook} 22. Bxe4 Bxc4 {of course he take back a pawn and threat my f1 rook, but what about f1 d1 ? I will still threat the a8 rook and in addition threat d4 pawns. Isnt this position in advantage for me ?} 23. Rfd1 {SO : at this time, master just leave me waiting untill the end and loose as "time out" ! what a dishonorable ending for such a hight elo's player. I suppose he has a ggod reason to abandon in this way. But anyway, i'm so happy to have been leading the game to this end ! YES ! please if you think it was a good game, rate it !}
