1. d4 f5 {Always inviting to attack the kingside, but it's tricky. I don't know very well why is not good for white to attack the kingside early, so I wanted to find out, taking advantage of the superior ELO... } 2. Bf4 {This is "my beloved 2nd move", and it can stand against almost anything, as far as I know. } Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3 {A temptation for black's Nh5, now or in the future. From now on, I have to be aware of the consecuences of this black's move at any time. } Be7 5. h4 {The "naive" attack I want to test. It leaves g4 to black, but I can assume it, as long as I am aware of his real attack possibilities from there. } O-O {Accepting the challenge, black castles into the fire. } 6. h5 {!? I know by experience that a normal developement doesn't get much, so I try this move. The intention is to force somehow g6, being dangerous for black with a pawn in h5. It is NOT my intention to play h6, since then g6 would be very solid for black, and white just lost tempoes. } Nd5 {Yes, I know. } 7. Bg3 {...? But this was a blunder. Bh2 was the right move, and it doesent matter if black presses with Bh4, white just plays f3 and that's all. Of course I plan to castle queenside from h4. But I miss, here, the crushing f4. When I realized it, I thought the best way to save the bishop was exf4, and wait for Nxf4. Black has the f column, but white seems able to stand and get to castle queenside safely. } Nc6 {Black delayes f4...} 8. Bc4 {I Planned to exchange the bishop for the knight, since c4 seemed dangerous. I need to develop, even by exchanging pieces, and I don't see I have time to create the "if you f4, I Bxh7+" threat. This is why I didn't play Bd3. I won't have two more moves to align the queen in c2. } f4 {Of course, I can't allow fxe3. } 9. Bxd5 {I eliminate the main black piece, and accept fxg3. } fxg3 10. Be4 {Now my bishop is aiming at h7, and my queen can join it in one move. The bad side is gxf2+, but I plan to answer Kf1. } d5 {Now, I lost my temper. Bd3 means to lose more time to charge the cannon, so I have to act quicly. } 11. Bxh7+ {What the hell, I have to demostrate that this h5 pawn is there for some reason. And black's queenside is badly undeveloped. } Kxh7 12. Qd3+ Rf5 13. fxg3 {...threatening g4, winning the rook. Black has just one move to solve the problem. } Qd6 {This threatens Qxg3+, that is deadly since Kf1 (protecting g2) pins the knight... but the black queen threatens other things, too, like Qb4+ (aiming at b2), and e4. I can't stop all them. } 14. Rh3 {Very simple, and gets a move for a future doubling of rooks on the h column. But I know that black played the queen move with a second intention. } e5 {Of course. And I can't allow e4. Unfortunatly, Ng5+ is impossible, nor g4. But maybe accurate analysis can find the "best" continuation for white... can you find one?} 15. dxe5 Nxe5 16. Nxe5 {I can't lose the rook pin, my best advantage... but still black has the third threat against white...} Qxe5 {I divert black from b4+ (with the queen), but now it threatens b2. I can't lose time defending, if I want something back from the position and my sacrifice...} 17. g4 {!? Time to use MY weapons, never mind if my opponent attacks my back... if I win on the front. } Qxb2 18. gxf5 Qxa1 19. f6+ {Now... this is the interesting part. I am one move from QxN+. How to go on after...} Kh8 {Here I discarded fxB, based on QxN+, Kmoves, BxR, protecting the 8th rank.} 20. fxg7+ {Black can't take with the king, so..} Qxg7 {Now. No castling, no Rg3... Rh2 just seems an invitation to Bh3...} 21. h6 {Black has the greedy...} Qxg2 {...but this leaves me with...} 22. Qd4+ {black can't stop the threat but by...} Kh7 {... well, now what? Repetition? My opponent suggested here Rh5 (in the aftergame), but I wasn't so sure after Qg1+, Kd2 (or Bg4+ forking the rook), Qf2+, Kmoves... can't black win?} 23. Qd3+ {Just clueless. I glanced a plan to exchange the rook for the promotion, but I simply forget about the Ra8, so I lose. There was a way out for white?} Qg6 {Now, Rg3 is tempting, but QxQ, dxQ, BxRh3. } 24. Qxg6+ Kxg6 {White missed the tempo to get a bishop for the pawn, with an hypotetic Rxg7+, Kxh6, RxB. With it, white could have saved the game. But I couldn't find a way to get it into the game...} 25. h7 Bxh3 {I realizednow that the pawn can't promote, so I resigned. A pity of a game... :-(}
