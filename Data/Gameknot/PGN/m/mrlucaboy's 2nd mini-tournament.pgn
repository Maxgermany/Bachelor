[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {My regular opening, the Reti.} Nc6 {Developing his queens-knight. Other good moves were 1. ... d5; 1. ... Nf6 or 1. ... c5 (leading into a Sicilian).} 2. d4 {Making a c1-h6-diagonal for my black bishop.. } d5 {Making place to deposit his bishop on g4 ?} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {This is somewhat a "closed fourknights-game" ? (while using the d-pawns, instead of the e-pawns ?)} 4. Bf4 {Normal developing..} h6 {I think this is a lost move for black; since I could've played directly 4. Bg5. } 5. h3 {Preventing black to play 5. ... Bg4. Also a lost move; since white could undo this threat by playing 5. e3; while opening a line for his king's bishop, in meanwhile.. } e6 6. e3 Bb4 {Pinning my knight in front of my king.. A good following move could be 7. ... Ne4.} 7. Qd2 {7. Bd3 or 7. Bb5 was better, in my opinion.. If 7. ... Bxc3 8. bxc3; that would give me a nice open b-line for my rook, while having a strong pawn-center.. Yes, but also an isolated a-pawn; wich isn't that good..  Hard choice !} Ne4 {As expected..} 8. Qd3 O-O 9. Ne5 {Giving some pressure in the center.. Note black's knight on e4; excellent position !} Nxe5 10. Bxe5 c5 {Black has the initiative now.. If 11. dxc5 Nxc5 --> My queen needs to move.. If white plays something else, then probably 11. ... c4 will come, and so the retreat of my queen.. } 11. dxc5 Nxc5 12. Qd4 {A nice place for white's Queen !! She's hunting after that uncovered black bishop !} f6 {Not really a move to worry about.. 13. Qxb4 fxe5  14. Qxc5  and black is down a piece..} 13. Qxb4 b6 {This gives white the chance to withdraw his bishop on e5. Black is quite inactive at the moment.. Still 3 pieces that hasn't moved.. Ok, white also has 3 pieces that hasn't moved yet, but the white bishop guards the f1-a6-diagonal; where it can be usefull to reduce black knight's movement.. } 14. Bg3 a5 15. Qd4 {Moving to a solid place in the center.. 15. ... e5 would lead to 16. Qxd5 , with queen-exchanging} Bb7 16. Be2 {Preparing castling on kingside.. } Qe7 17. O-O Rad8 {I don't really understand this move.. In my opinion, the control over the open c-line is more important.. } 18. b4 {Giving some pressure and starting an attack on white's queenside.. } axb4 19. Qxb4 {Aiming for that lonely b-pawn.} Qd7 {I'm not so sure about this move.. Preparing 20. ... Ne4  21. Nxe4 dxe4; while gaining control over the d-line ?} 20. Qxb6 Rdc8 {Giving some back-up for his knight; a normal move, but quiet inactive for black.. } 21. Bb5 {Let's hunt that queen !} Qd8 22. Qxd8 Rfxd8 23. Rfd1 {Some extra help, in case black wants to play d4..} Ba6 {Activating his bishop.. 24. Bxa6 Nxa6 25. ? Nb4 would give a nice spot to place black's knight.. So I'm not going to help him with that.. } 24. a4 {If now black decides to play 24. ... Bxb5  25. axb5, then white has the full control over the a-line.. } Bb7 {This means the lost of 1 move; 23. ... Ba6.} 25. Be2 {Giving some room for my a-pawn to move up.. And in meanwhile, the b-line is opened.. } Rca8 26. Ra3 Bc6 {Triple-attacking my pawn.. Not really a good idea, since black looses a piece in trade for a pawn.. } 27. a5 {White has clearly advantage ! Note his two active bishops.. } Na6 {Stopping my pawn, and maybe aiming for 28. ... Nb4 ?} 28. Bxa6 {I surely want to trade some pieces, since I have a far better position.. } Rxa6 29. Rb1 {Gaining control over the open b-line.. Next move will be Rb6.. } Raa8 30. Rb6 Bd7 {A logical move.. Defending his e-pawn, and making room for 31. ... Rdc8 ?} 31. a6 Rdc8 32. a7 {Winning move for white.. If black plays 32. ... Rxa7 33. Rxa7, he's lost.. If he decides to wait, then white plays Rb8, with the trading of rooks, (white can simply capture with his black bishop; while having one rook behind..) and he's lost.. } Bc6 33. Rb8 Rcxb8 34. axb8=Q+ {Black has seen the trap and gives up.. I really love this game; it shows how important it is to develop pieces, and about gaining (and holding) control about open lines with your rooks.. Thanks b767-300er for the nice game.. I hope you people enjoyed this annotation ! Feedback is welcome ! :)}
