1. e4 c5 {54th GK Tournament, Round 1. I have won 4 lost 1, this is the final unfinished game. Homyak leads our section with 5 wins 1 loss. I can move on to round two, but only if I win this game to tie Homyak. I am playing black and choose the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 {Standard main line so far. } 5. Nc3 Nf6 {Unusual move order (black transposed his 4th and 5th moves), but we're in the Classical Line now.} 6. Bb5 Bd7 {Breaking the pin.} 7. O-O g6 8. Nf3 Bg7 {Looking dragonish now.} 9. Re1 O-O 10. e5 Nxe5 {I'm not sure the push 10. e5 is sound. I feel the need to test it.} 11. Nxe5 dxe5 {OK, now white can play 12. Rxe5 safely, but it leaves his rook precariosly advanced.} 12. Bg5 Bxb5 {White forgoes the easy pawn and develops his bishop.} 13. Nxb5 Qb6 {Threatens the white knight while adding a defender to the black knight. White can move his knight, but then the black queen is free to rampage at b2.} 14. c4 a6 {Chasing the knight away.} 15. Be3 Qc6 {But first white chased black's queen away, so now she threatens the unprotected pawn at c4.} 16. Na3 Rad8 {Seize the open file, with an attack on the white queen.} 17. Qe2 Rfe8 {Anticipating that white could return his bishop to g5 discovering a powerful attack on e5. The only good move to defend in that case is Nd7, but that would lose the pawn at e7. Thus, I play 17. Rfe8 to cover that eventuality.} 18. Bg5 Nh5 {I decided on h5 as a stepping stone to f4.} 19. Nc2 Nf4 {Inviting the bishop trade.} 20. Bxf4 exf4 {Black moves his pawn off of e5 and frees his bishop's line of attack.} 21. Rab1 e5 {Protecting the advanced pawn.} 22. Nb4 Qc5 {Threatening the knight.} 23. a3 Rd4 {Now the pawn.} 24. Rec1 Rc8 {Again.} 25. Nd3 Qc7 26. c5 e4 {Sneaky white found a way to save the pawn. For now.} 27. Ne1 Rcd8 {Doubling on the open file.} 28. Rc2 Qc6 {Eyballing f3, but I will need to bring a rook to bear on it too.} 29. b4 Qd5 {Tripling the threat on the open d-file. Not sure where it will lead, other than possibly a lot of exchanges, hoping to exploit my  pawn endgame. Unfortunately, this is where my opponent timed out. A victory for me, but not the way I like. Fortunately, this happened before the tournament reached 90% complete. Had we still been playing when 90% of all games were complete, this game would be counted as a draw, and I would not have advanced to the next round. Now my score is tied for first place in our group, with both me and homyak at 5-1 (we split our games against each other and we each scored 2-0 against the other two opponents in the group). Now I'm looking forward to round two!}
