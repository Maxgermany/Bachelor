[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. f4 {After the match-up, as normal I checked the internets and discovered this is called the "Sicilian - Grand Prix Attack". Not something I'm familiar with, again. At the time, although I was shocked to see it instead of something like Nf3, it seemed unsound to me. It looks to me like a quick d5. . .} d5 {. . . neutralises the threat of attack against my king.} 3. exd5 Qxd5 {Normally, I dislike throwing my queen out early. I've been learning to play by playing blitz chess every week for the last three months. My education has been hard, but I quickly learnt that exposing my queen early on was a good way to lose quickly. However, in this instance, although I was nervous it seemed the best possible move. The e-file is open in front of white's king, which, if a quick defense isn't sorted (perhaps d3?), will allow me to pick off the weakened f-pawn.} 4. c4 {Threatens my queen, to no purpose. Easily avoided. Probably would've been better to continue development, Nc3 would've been more of a threat I believe.} Qe4+ {Check and forks white's c-pawn and f-pawn} 5. Qe2 {I considered the exchange offered, but decided that since white is currently better developed I would. . .} Qxf4 {. . . decline. This pins white's pawn at d2} 6. g3 {Forces my queen to retreat} Qd6 7. d4 {Once more, I prefer Nc3 here} cxd4 {I now have passed pawns on e7 and d4, white's pawn formation is in a shambles whereas I haven't even begun to develop mine} 8. Bf4 {Poor move, leaves the b-pawn weakened} Qb4+ 9. Qd2 Nc6 10. a3 Qxd2+ {Finally, after having decimated white's pawn formation, I agree to the exchange} 11. Nxd2 {I think Bxd2 was better, allowing for 11...e5 12.b4 Nf6 13.b5 Ne7 14.Nf3 Ng6. This would've kept white in the game, whereas Nxd2 meant more of a loss of material.} e5 {Attacking white's bishop, protecting my passed pawn on d4 and advancing my other passed pawn to e5} 12. Bh3 {White offers exchange of bishops. . . strangely. Although the ensuing exchange stops my ability to queen-side castle, it leaves me with a nice material advantage. Not sure if there was a better move availiable, I think white's ds-bishop was dead anyway.} exf4 13. Bxc8 Rxc8 14. gxf4 Nf6 15. O-O-O Ng4 {Aiming at forking the white's king and rook. However, if that fails can use it as a quick way to defend against a check from white's rook on the e-file by moving to the protected square e3} 16. Re1+ {As expected, check comes in} Be7 {Opens up king-side castle} 17. Nh3 {White's knight is now at the edge of the board, a less than useful position for it!} Ne3 {As mentioned, protection along the e-file. Also closes off the spaces availiable to white's king, which can only move to b1 now} 18. b4 {Kb1 better?} a5 {Planning on further disruptions to white's pawn structure and looking at the ds-bishop check on a3, which will force the white king to b1} 19. bxa5 {Nb3 maybe? Would've allowed attack my knight on e3 and take my pawn on d4} Bxa3+ 20. Kb1 Nxa5 {Aiming at briging my knight into play at c4. The two knights will defend eachother, and will confine the white king to a1, a2 and b1.} 21. Nf3 Naxc4 {Passed pawn on b7 and d4} 22. Nxd4 O-O 23. Ka2 {Not that white had many good options here, but I think this was probably one of the wost he could've chosen. Rxe3 was slightly better, although after 23...Nxe3 24.Nb5 Nc4 25.Rd1 Rc5 26.Nd4 Rd8 27.Ng5 Bb2 28.Ngf3 Rcd5 29.Ne5 Ne3 30.Nxf7 Nxd1 31.Nxd8 Rxd8 he's still going to have a ruinous loss of material.} Rfd8 24. Nf5 {White opens the d-file for me, and at this point I started to think about mate. The board pattern looks familiar, so I'm willing to suggest that Nf5 stepped into forced mate, if someone could confirm that I'd be grateful. I think Rxe3 was better.} Rd2+ 25. Kb3 Rb2+ 26. Kc3 Nd6+ {Now I know it's mate in 6 - 27.Kd3 Rb3+ 28.Ke2 Rc2+ 29.Kf3 Nexf5+ 30.Re3 Rxe3+ 31.Kg4 Rg2+ 32.Kh5 Rxh3#} 27. Kd4 Nexf5+ {Mate in 3 thanks to Kd4 - 28.Kd3 Bb4 29.Re8+ Rxe8 30.Ng1 Rd2#} 28. Kd3 Bb4 {And my opponent resigns. It was a fun game, and a good lesson in the power of pawns. Once white's pawns were gone, although he had more manoeuvrability with his major pieces, he also had no-where to hide. I believe it was this weakened defense that allowed me to dictate the game.}
