1. Nf3 {I tend to open with the Reti when I play with White.} Nf6 2. d4 d5 3. c4 Nc6 {We're into a Queen's Gambit game, an opening I just beginning to learn - and it showed.} 4. Nc3 Bg4 {Black goes with the Chigorin Defense.  I didn't know that during the game--I learned this after the game.} 5. e3 {5.e3--an error on my part.  I believe better would have been cxd5.  } Bxf3 6. Qxf3 e5 7. dxe5 {7. dxe5?  I wish I could tell you what I was thinking.  7. cxd5 would have been better.} Nxe5 8. Qd1 {8. Qf5 would have been better.} dxc4 {And I'm down a pawn and I'll remain that way for most of the game.} 9. Qa4+ {9. Qa4+  My hope was that Black would block check with a Knight allowing me to play 10. Bxc4.  He went ahead and blocked with his Q.} Qd7 {9...c6 would have been better, because if 10. Bxc4 then 10...b5 } 10. Qxd7+ {At this point, my thought was if I retreated the Q, I'd be so behind in development, it would be impossible to overcome.} Nfxd7 11. Be2 Nd3+ {There's goes possible compensation (Bishop pair) for the loss of my pawn.} 12. Bxd3 cxd3 {It's not typically a good thing when one's opponent has advanced a passed pawn to the 6th rank by move 12.} 13. O-O {13.  O-O  The difference between OTB's with a clock running vs the time I can take in correspondence chess.  Clearly, 13. Nb5 would have been better and would have allowed White to even material.} O-O-O 14. Bd2 {Simply blocking the passer.} Nb6 15. b3 {I was clear that Black's plan was Nc4, attacking the Bishop.  15. b3 stopped this.} Be7 16. a4 {I wasn't sure what else to do so I developed the plan to try and open up the King's defenses.} Bf6 17. Rac1 {Protecting the N and lining up on Black's King.} Bxc3 {This seemed like a mistake by Black.  It's a wide open board and he traded his B for my N--not to mention that it brings White's Rook a bit closer to Black's King.} 18. Rxc3 Rd6 19. e4 {I wanted to keep the N from centralizing but this was silly on my part because if White moved Nd5, then Rxd3.  This move also opened a diagonal for White the Bishop.} h5 {I guess Black was thinking it was time for a pawn storm.} 20. Rd1 {I was hoping Black would continue with the pawn storm and Bf4 would allow White to take the bone out of his throat (d3).} Rhd8 {No such luck.} 21. Bf4 {But this still puts pressure on c7.} Rd6d7 22. a5 {Continuing in my plan to open up the Black's defenses and pushing the N back into the corner.  } Na8 {Of course, the downside is that c7 has another defender.} 23. f3 {Protecting e4 and opening a line for the White King to get to e3.} c6 24. Kf2 Nc7 25. Bxc7 {I thought with this move, I'd be able to finally be able to move in and take d3.} Kxc7 26. Ke3 d2 {And my hopes are dashed.} 27. b4 {Back to attacking Black's King.} Rd7d4 28. b5 Ra4 29. Rxd2 {29. Rd2 was a mistake.  Much better would have been 29. bxc6 bxc6 30. Rc5} Rxd2 30. Kxd2 Rxa5 31. bxc6 bxc6 32. Rc2 {To protect against Ra2+ followed by Rxg2} Rb5 33. Kd3 a5 {Passed pawns must be pushed.  White is in serious trouble.} 34. f4 a4 35. Kc4 Kb6 36. g3 {I'm pushing these pawns as I hope it distracts my opponent and I'm not sure what else there is.} Rc5+ 37. Kd3 {necessary.} Rxc2 38. Kxc2 {Here is where I was relatively certain that I had lost.  But I heard freddy (easy19) tell me that I can learn more in a hopeless game than in a winning game.} Kc5 {Black centralizing the K--not good for White. } 39. Kb2 {Got to stop a4.} Kb4 40. h3 {My only hope is to push my pawns and hope Black gets distracted.  } c5 {No luck.} 41. g4 {I'm going to ride the "Distraction Plan."  White really has nothing else.} h4 {hmmm...is that a ray of hope?} 42. g5 c4 {No, I guess not.  Black simply has to push a4 and c4 and the game is his.} 43. g6 c3+ 44. Kc2 {Trying to buy time...I don't suppose Black will move 44...a3} f6 45. e5 a3 {45...a3?  Oh my, I'm doing some calculating and I may be back in this. } 46. exf6 a2 {46. a2? This allows White to advance f6 to Queen with check.} 47. f7 a1=Q 48. f8=Q+ {At this point, we each had about 5 minutes left and I didn't trust my ability to calculate out a win.  I also felt extremely lucky to have a draw.  It was offered and accepted.  I was not generally pleased with my game overall but it certainly proves the point that no one wins (or draws) by resigning.  It certainly was good fun to play in a tourney game.  (as an aside, I easily won my second game against a player with a rating of 1391.)  As alwayss comments are appreciated.}
