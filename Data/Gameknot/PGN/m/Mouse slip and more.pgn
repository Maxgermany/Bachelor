1. b3 {Doing this just because I was tired of what I usually move first as White.} Nf6 {Not committing any central pawns yet.} 2. Bb2 g6 3. e3 {Very conservative by me. My opponent eventually does get quite a space advantage but does not make use of it.} Bg7 4. d4 d5 {Clamping down on the white position. C5 would have been interesting here.} 5. Nc3 c6 {With this move, the center will stay locked up for a long time.} 6. Be2 {Bd3 might have been better, to contest e4 more and eye the black kingside.} Nbd7 {The game is mostly equal here.} 7. Nf3 {Just developing moveds for a bit.} Qc7 8. O-O O-O 9. Na4 {During the game, I decided to mostly move here to tempt black to weaken the C5 square. But it's mostly a feint. Moving the knight in general to the edge of the board is not usually a good move, but in this position it's not bad.} Ne4 {The black knight won't stay there too long. Premature to do this?} 10. Bd3 {Admitting that Be2 was a mistake. I had other choices here of course, and thought about moving c4. But I did not want the position opening up yet, despite the fact that allowing it to stay closed is better for black right now.} f5 {I don't like this black move. it leaves the black Kingside really open. I can't take advantage of that for a long while, but I am not going to trade on e4, which is perhaps what black was hoping for.} 11. Kh1 {This was not the best move, but I am planning on moving the f pawn, and want the king off of the a7-g1 diagonal. It's a long preparation for chasing the knight, and black eventually gains an advantage because of it.} a5 {Perhaps black is entertaining ideas of a queenside attack with this move.} 12. Ng1 {This move is too slow, and black has a tiny push now on the queenside.} b5 13. Nc3 {The best thing for white to do.} Nb6 {Instead of an immediate push of the queenside pawns, black has moved Nb6 here. This allows me the tempo I needed to move the f pawn, although black's idea is to really strangle the queenside here, and it's not a bad plan.} 14. f3 Nxc3 {Practically forced, for black to maintan his initiative on the queenside.} 15. Bxc3 e5 {A sharp move. The intent is to allow the queenside pawn advances. I don't like, finally, white's position here; black has a clear advantage to me. I decide to give up a pawn here, depending on what black does, and blunt his pawn advance.} 16. e4 {Some may consider this a blunder, but I am thinking about the position; I'd rather have chances with a tactical opportunity by a more open board, than be crushed by black's superior positioning, to this point in this game. My opponent is ranked around the expert level or a bit higher; he's no slouch.} exd4 17. Bd2 {Giving black the point.} fxe4 18. fxe4 Be6 {This seemed unnecessary to me. Why? Because there is no way I am going to allow black to get his bishop or knight to d5 with tempo. The white e pawn is not going to move! Well, at least, not for a long while. It allows me to get my rooks connected, so a rook exchange initiated by black will help get my a rook into the action. This black bishop move is, in my opinion, his first unproductive move, and allows me some chances. ;)} 19. Qe2 {So perhaps I could have traded rooks here; but now at least my queen is not on the back rank.} a4 {Black continues on the queenside, but perhaps should have traded rooks here. So I seize that opportunity myself.} 20. Rxf8+ {I am down a little material; but I want to get some counter play against the black king, and distract black from that queenside for at least a little bit.} Rxf8 21. Nf3 {I use the tempo to get my knight to a better square. I want my rook on f1, and have time to get there without worsening my pawn structure on the queenside when the black a pawn takes my b pawn.} Ra8 {I have decided now to let black have his way on that a file, in favor of trying to harass the black kingside in return. My king potentially remains vulnerable to back rank mates, I'll have to watch that.} 22. Rf1 axb3 23. axb3 Ra2 {This move does not initially do anything, although it puts pressure on the 2nd rank of course. Black will push his pawns hoping for a material gain on the queenside. However, he is in time trouble now, and does not pick out the best moves, while I am able to just simply push the position a bit on the kingside, and thereby wrest the initiative from black shortly. Because of his time trouble and the tricky pawn position, black loses his way in a bit.} 24. Qf2 {Qf2. Here I want my queen in front, for greater flexibility as I harass the black king. After a short think, black makes an inaccurate move.} c5 {Now I'll be able to fight back.} 25. Ng5 {The game is pretty much equal here despite black being a pawn up. Black still has the two bishop advantage, and wants to keep it. But the position is now dangerous for black; so the seemingly natural move he makes is not the right one.} Bc8 {Black intends Bb7, so as to have pressure down the a8-h1 diagonal. But he doesn't have time for that plan to come to fruition. White is able now with tactics to force concessions from black, as white grabs the initiatve firmly. I was happy to move the natural looking...} 26. Qh4 {Qh4! And suddenly black is in a bit of trouble.} h6 27. Nf7 {I liked this move. What will black choose to do?} Qxf7 {Black chooses to give back the point. Now, in this position, both our times are getting low. Black has less than 20 seconds, and I have less than a minute. I fail to see Qd8+, but my King still has a backrank mate issue anyways. At this point, the game continuation is still heavily favoring white now ::EDITED:: Qd8, after further looking here, is crushing; the backrank mate is not going to be an issue: Qd8+! with the knight en prise, if black moves the king, RxQ and the white bishop or rook could move to f1 to block a check; and if black moves the queen or bishop, the rook simply takes the queen, and after it's recapture white gets to g1, and there is no more backrank mate issue, and the game here is for all purposes decided after one of the two minor black pieces on the queenside falls.} 28. Rxf7 Kxf7 29. g3 {Kg1 was probably better.} Bb7 {Now black is down to 14 seconds, and blunders. Here I was contemplating Bxh6, and had my mouse holding the bishop. Then I realized trading now would hamper my firepower for closing the deal; and as I pondered that, I saw that Qf4 was just winning, and tried to set my bishop back down. But, while holding it, the mouse had drifted. We've all done this, had a mouse slip at an inopportune time. So, for all of you who have taken the time to read this, recognize that the game is really not worth following after this point; this is the winning position, for white will gain major material on the queenside, and even with best play, black will not be able to stop a mating attack. Blah blah blah! Mouse slip. But, here is what happened...} 30. Ba5 {Ouch! Kudos to the mouse. Now, the position is a draw, if black takes the bishop. However black was in a rush, and whether because he knew it was a slip, or wanted to do something else, he does not take it.} Ra1+ 31. Kg2 Nd7 32. Bd8 Nf6 {And another blunder by black, Nf6. Finally, the e pawn is free to move.} 33. e5 Ne4 {So the game would have been a bit better without the mouse slip. At this point, white just finishes:} 34. Qe7+ Kg8 35. Qxb7 {And now an overwhelming white advantage. Here black has no real good moves left, and decides he can't tolerate that e pawn and takes it.} Bxe5 36. Qxd5+ {After this move, black quit the game, because there is no way to survive further material loss, and there is also an upcoming mate in several moves. I was disappointed that the mouse slip upset the normal evolution of the game. Hope you enjoyed this one!}
