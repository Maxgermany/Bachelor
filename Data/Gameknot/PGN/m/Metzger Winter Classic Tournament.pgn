1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {Seemed to be opting for more of a closed sicilian here.} d6 4. Bb5 Bd7 5. Bxc6 {white giving up his bishop pair is important as it determined that black's gameplan would be to open up the game and get as many pawns as possible off the board.} Bxc6 6. d3 {A better move here would probably be d4. Because if d4, cxd4, Nxd4 then white has an advantage in controlling the center of the board.} Nf6 7. Bf4 e5 8. Bg5 Be7 9. Qd2 {White seems to be setting up to castle queen's side here, however such an innocent looking move had repercussions later on in the game.} h6 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. O-O {White ends up castling King's Side anyways. This is probably correct because it is much easier for white to launch an attack on White's queen side than on his king side right now.} b5 {Black has already started assaulting the queen side in hopes of gaining material.} 12. Ne2 {The knight probably had a better spot on d5. If Nd5, Bxd5, c4- then the position seems to be about even. The only downside to this variation would be that it is opening up the board for blacks black-squared bishop.} b4 {The advance of the pawn happened anyway. This limits the white queen for the time being and puts pressure on the queen's side.} 13. c3 bxc3 14. bxc3 Rb8 {Black gains control of the open b file with this move.} 15. d4 {c4 is probably better as it locks up the position more and the goal of white is to keep the game closed up and prevent black's bishop pair from really controlling the game. This also gives up the e pawn for free.} Bxe4 16. Qe3 Bxf3 {Questionable Move. Gives up the bishop pair after a long variation.} 17. Qxf3 exd4 18. cxd4 Bxd4 19. Nxd4 cxd4 20. Qe4+ Qe7 {Black is more than happy to trade queens as it clears up the pawns a bit more and his doubled past pawns will start to be important.} 21. Qxd4 O-O {Black finally gets his king to safety. } 22. Rfe1 Qd7 23. Rac1 Rfe8 24. Red1 {White wants to avoid trading when one pawn down.} Re6 25. Qd5 {This move slightly confuses me as it doesn't seem to accomplish much.} Rb5 26. Qa8+ {Another questionable move. It doesn't accomplish anything as Black's king can move to h7 and White can't continue the attack. } Kh7 27. Rc8 {This starts looking interesting for white, but the excitement dies when you realize that black's king can run away and white will accomplish nothing of any benefit.} Rbe5 {Black is threatening checkmate here and white has to deal with the threat of RE1+. After the exchange of rooks its mate.  } 28. g3 {Giving the king somewhere to run to, moving the h pawn up is probably better here though.} Re5e1+ 29. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 30. Kg2 Re2 31. Rh8+ Kg6 32. Rd8 Qe6 33. Rf8 {Bad move, gives up a pawn and lines up the black queen and rook after Qxa2.  } Qxa2 34. Qf3 {Queen comes back to help.} a5 {advancing the two past pawns will be the key to the game for black.} 35. h4 Qe6 {Threats of Qe4 forcing a trade of queens.} 36. h5+ Kh7 37. Qd3+ Qe4+ {Allows white to win a pawn in exchange for a queen trade. In this situation A queen trade is bad for white as it will become hard for him to deal with two past pawns with only a rook. } 38. Qf3 {Bad move. This move gives up the pawn white would have won if he had traded queens right away. } Qxf3+ 39. Kxf3 Re5 {Offering to exchange h5 for f7. } 40. g4 f6 41. Ra8 f5 42. Kf4 fxg4 43. Kxg4 Rc5 {Threatening to advance the d pawn.} 44. Ra6 {Not a good move. Doesn't accomplish anything. Basically forces Black to advance his past pawn, which Black is more than okay with doing that. } d5 45. f4 d4 46. Rd6 Rc4 47. Kf5 a4 48. Ke6 a3 49. Ra6 Rc3 50. f5 d3 51. f6 d2 52. Rd6 {Better move here is f7 as Black then has no way to stop the pawn from becoming a queen. } a2 53. Rd7 {Blunder, gives up the f pawn.} Rc6+ 54. Kf7 {Bad move. Allows Black to take the pawn with check.} Rxf6+ 55. Ke8 a1=Q 56. Ke7 {Another blunder, allows mate in 2. } Qe5+ 57. Kd8 Rf8# {}
