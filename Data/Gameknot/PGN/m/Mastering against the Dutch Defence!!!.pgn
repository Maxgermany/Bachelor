[Opening "Dutch defence (A81)"]

1. d4 {So d4 is a typical opening move for me. Few years ago i used e4 as my main opening, with no great success.} f5 {f5... The Dutch Defence, never face it on Gameknot before that game. I know some really good players that use it permanently against d4, with great success.} 2. g3 {So my first thought is to go on with c4, but then i decided to fianchetto on my king's side, be more safe.} e6 {I think g6 is more common here, at least from what i saw from my blitz games. Maybe e6 is one of the main lines too, i don't know.} 3. Bg2 {Bg2 controlling the nice diagonal h1-a8.} Nf6 {Nf6 seems fine, developing a piece.} 4. Nf3 {Nf3 protecting the d4 pawn and also the e5 square.} d5 {d5!? I think that's not a really good move, as the e6 pawn is now hanging around! Also seems wortheless from the time that my opponent chose f5 for his first move. g6 and then Bg7 is a classical set up for the Dutch i think.} 5. O-O {Finished with my King's protection and now time to organize the rest of my pieces.} c5 {c5 is nice, at least i like it. But black should first be aware of his defence and then play c5.} 6. c4 {And c4. Taking on c5 doesnt help me. This pawn set up reminds me the Symmetrical (Austrian) Defence and the Tarrasch Defence from the QGD.} cxd4 {He took the pawn.} 7. cxd5 {And i took the pawn on d5} Nxd5 {He took it back with his knight.} 8. Nxd4 {And the same goes for me.} Bc5 {Now black is developing his DS Bishop opening also space for 0-0. But after a while i noticed that black losses a pawn with that move.} 9. Nxf5 {Nxf5 and the pawn is gone. Now i am a pawn up and my set up is truly better. Finished with my King's defence and organizing an attack. If exf5 the knight on d5 is both threatened by my bishop and my Queen.} O-O {0-0 is an option here but i said before few lines his e6 pawn is a problem on his set up.} 10. Ne3 {My knight goes back, a logical option i guess.} Nxe3 {He took it opening the d file at the same time.} 11. Qxd8 {So exchanging our Queen is not a bad idea, keeping in mind i have a better position and i'm a pawn up.} Rxd8 {Logical.} 12. Bxe3 {So i took the knight after the Queen's exchange.} Bxe3 {And now it's time for a bishop exchange.} 13. fxe3 {I took it and open the f file an important one. Now i have doubled pawns but i that didn't stop my plans. Both we are with a knight and bishop.} Nc6 {Knight development.} 14. Nc3 {Same goes for me. } a6 {a6 in order to avoid moves like Nb5 and for a future b5 pushing the pawns.} 15. Rad1 {Now i am challenging the d file. Time for our rooks to work! } Rd7 {Bad move, blocking his bishop. Exchanging would be better for him i think.} 16. Na4 {Now there's a hole in c5 and b6, two strong squares for my knight.} Rb8 {Rb8 is forced here to avoid a possible Nb6 even though he can play Rxd1 anytime.} 17. Nc5 {So the other square is a good one too. Now there's a threat on the rook and the e6 pawn.} Rc7 {Rc7 is not giving him much i think. Rxd1 would be better cause now both of his rook have no view while both mind control the two open files, f and d. Also there's a ''trap'' here. He wiil lose his knight or be checkmated.} 18. Bxc6 {The good move! Taking the knight with power, no time to hesitate it. Now he's -4 behind but he can still fall in the ''trap''.} Rxc6 {And he did it. He was not careful at all with that.} 19. Rd8# {A pure checkmate is coming after that. Great coordination of my rooks and a fine and fast game as well. Checkmate on move 19.
