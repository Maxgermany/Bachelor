1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 b6 {A Queen's pawn game.} 4. Bd3 Bb7 5. O-O Be7 6. c4 O-O 7. Nc3 h6 8. e4 {White creates a strong pawn centre.} d5 9. cxd5 exd5 10. e5 Ne4 11. Qe2 Nxc3 12. bxc3 Qc8 {Black's position has a few targets (g7,h6 and h7) since all of these are on the kingside, a kingside attack is clearly the most logical continuation. The weakness on the b1-h7 diagonal suggests a queen & bishop battery (with the obvious mate threat on h7), but a sacrifice on h6 could also be possible. Whilst White has time since counterattack is a long way away for Black, Black does threat 13...Ba6 to rid White of his strongest piece. This would still be playable e.g. 13.a4 Ba6 14.Bxa6 Qxa6 15.Qxa6 Nxa6 16.a5... With a favourable - if slight - position for White. Nonetheless, White should aim for more in a dominant position such as this....} 13. Bb1 {(!) Threatening the battery on the b1-h7 diagonal.} Ba6 14. Qc2 g6 {Here Black sets a trap. If 15.Bxh6?... Then 15...Bxf1 16.Bxf8 Bxg2! And Black shows potential for a counter.} 15. Re1 {(!) Black is now forced to respond.} Kg7 16. Qd2 Rh8 {Note how g6 is now weakened.} 17. e6 {(!) Inducing further concessions by Alexandrov.} f5 18. g4 {If 18...fxg4 then 19.Qc2! Qe8 20.Ne5... and 21.Nxg6... or 21.Nf7...} Nc6 19. gxf5 gxf5 20. Qf4 Qf8 21. Qg3+ Kh7 22. Kh1 {(!) A quiet but powerful move!} Qf6 23. Nh4 Bd6 24. Qh3 Ne7 25. Nxf5 Kg8 26. Nxd6 {Here Black resigned. Note how Black had a vision to remove the d3-bishop which White anticipated fantastically and didn't give his opponent a chance.}
