[Opening "Sicilian defence (B30)"]

1. e4 {She starts conventionally} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {We play out the first moves of a main line Sicilian, one of my favourite openings.} 3. Nc3 {This is slightly unusual. 3. d4 is normal.} d6 {I play this, expecting her to transpose back with 4. d4} 4. Be2 {But she plays this!} g6 {I played this - and almost immediately regretted it. She could have played 5. d4 and transposed into variations of the Dragon Sicilian, which I am not too familiar with.} 5. O-O {Bt she played this.} Bg7 {So I stop d4 for now.} 6. d3 {She continues to develop.} a6 {And I start to mobilize my queen side, like I usually do.} 7. Be3 {She develops.} b5 {I continue with my queen side advances.} 8. d4 {And I was now very happy. Surely by playing d3 followed by d4 she has just wasted a move?} cxd4 {So I take.} 9. Nxd4 {She takes back.} Bb7 {I protect Nc6.} 10. Bf3 {I was very happy when I saw this move. It prevents aggressive thrusts with f3 or f4. Now Rc8 or Ne5 gives black a good game.} Nf6 {OK, stop - work out white's best move now.} 11. e5 {Did you get it? Immediately after playing Nf6?? I saw it. I am now losing a piece, as both knights are attacked.} dxe5 {And this is the worst way to lose it. Other moves, such as Rc8, Nxe5 mean that at least I get a pawn for it.} 12. Nxc6 {The best way to take.} Qc7 {I have to save my queen.} 13. Nxe5 {And now I don't even have one pawn for the piece.} Rd8 {I attack his queen.} 14. Qe2 {Queen moves.} b4 {I am trying to confuse the issue. Against a higher rated opponent I might have resigned.} 15. Bxb7 {So she takes.} Qxb7 {I take back.} 16. Na4 {With maybe coming into b6} Nd5 {So I stop that, and uncover an attack on her Ne5.} 17. Nf3 {I'm not sure this retreat is best.} O-O {I finally castle.} 18. Rad1 {She attacks my knight.} Nxe3 {So I whip off her bishop.} 19. Qxe3 {I prefer fxe3.} Rdc8 {As I now gain a tempo attacking c2.} 20. c3 {She gets everything protected. I now rather feared her N going to b6 then d5, so I decided to stop that.} e6 21. cxb4 {This exchange seems to lead to me getting pressure.} Qxb4 {I take back.} 22. Qb3 {She seeks a queen exchange - usually the right idea if you are materially up - however her pawns get doubled and I get pressure.} Qxb3 23. axb3 {So we exchange.} Rc2 {Rook attacks!} 24. Rd2 {Rook defends!} Rfc8 {At least all my three main pieces are now working well together.} 25. Nc3 {She blocks the c file.} Rxd2 26. Nxd2 {So I exchange rooks.} Bxc3 {and now win a pawn, and my remaining rook is still active. This must be better for white though.} 27. bxc3 Rxc3 28. h3 {This is a mistake. She needed to develop her rook.} Rd3 {She has a problem now - if the knight moves, b3 goes.} 29. Rd1 {So she tries to hang on to that pawn.} a5 {And I tie that pawn down.} 30. g3 {Another mistake. Kf1 was needed. Now I wanted to play a4 and if she takes the pawn, Ra3 and I get the pawn back. But I was afraid of her meeting a4 with b4! and she is winning easily. So I dropped my rook back a square to prevent b3-b4.} Rd4 31. Kf1 {At last her king comes over.} a4 {I advance.} 32. bxa4 {She takes.} Rxa4 {I take back, and at last I feel I have a chance of holding this game. With all the pawns on the king side it is hard for white to convert. But surely white will not lose?} 33. Nf3 {So her knight comes up.} Kg7 {My king improves its position.} 34. h4 {She has a plan of Ng5 and attacks on my pawns on h7 and f7} Kf6 {So my king goes up} 35. Ng5 {Knight comes in.} h6 {And I attack her knight. We have both reached the time control. We were playing with electronic clocks. She continues to move fast, not realising that she has another 15 minutes to come on when her time runs out. I didn't realise her comprehension until a few moves later, when I explained the situation to her - but by then her position was lost. } 36. Nh3 {The knight drops back.} e5 {I improve my pawns.} 37. g4 {And this move throws away a couple of pawns, and then she has a difficult position.} Rxg4 {I take.} 38. h5 {This is a nice try by her.} Rh4 {I fork her knight and pawn.} 39. Rd3 {She protects the knight. Round about here she offered me a draw, which I instantly turned down. I commented that if she had offered me it about 10 moves ago I would have accepted. The position is easier to play for black, but white should be able to draw it.} Rxh5 {I take the pawn.} 40. Rf3+ {This check only makes things worse.} Rf5 {I block.} 41. Rxf5+ Kxf5 {The rook exchange helps me.} 42. Kg2 Ke4 43. f3+ Ke3 {Her knight is tied up, her position completely passive, but it is not lost yet.} 44. Nf2 f5 {I think here maybe the knight should get some freedom with Nd1 check.} 45. Kg3 Ke2 {I don't give it another chance now.} 46. Kg2 g5 47. Kg3 h5 48. Nh3 f4+ {Driving her king back before advancing, keeping my pawns together. It is hard for white, but not impossible.} 49. Kg2 g4 50. fxg4 hxg4 {At the time I thought this position hopelessly lost for white. However, a look at a free on-line ending database shows me that actually white can draw with Nf2, with careful play. All other moves lose.} 51. Ng1+ Ke1 {The knight is now without any sensible moves.White can't do anything about the e pawn marching down the board. She plays on to mate, but further annotation is not necessary.} 52. Kh2 Kf2 53. Kh1 e4 54. Kh2 e3 55. Kh1 e2 56. Kh2 e1=Q 57. Nh3+ gxh3 58. Kxh3 Qe6+ 59. Kh4 Qg6 60. Kh3 Qg3# {Many thanks for reading, please rate my annotation with the star system, leave a comment or two, and until next time dear reader!}
