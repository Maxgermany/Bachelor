[Opening "Sicilian (B58), Boleslavsky, Louma variation"]

1. e4 {He starts conventionally.} c5 {With so many Italian friends on here, of course I play the Sicilian!} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {We follow the main line of the Open Sicilian for 5 moves.} 6. Be2 {Less aggressive than 6. Bc4 or Bg5, but perfectly playable. } e5 {I play the Boleslavsky variation. http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessopening?eco=B59 Black puts up with a backward d pawn on a semi-open file, and a weak d5 square in return for time and counter-attacking opportunities. } 7. Nxc6 {I think this is a mistake, as at a stroke, after the pawn recapture, black hasn't a weak d5 square any more and after prearation can normally play d6-d5, and have a good centre.} bxc6 8. O-O Be7 9. Be3 O-O {Both sides have made natural developing moves. White's best is now Kh1 or f4, hitting black's pawn centre before he gets the chance of advancing in the centre.} 10. Bf3 {This looks like another mistake to me, blocking his f pawn. Without advancing his f pawn how is he going to attack?} Be6 {besides he can't hold back d6-d5 for long.} 11. Ne2 {Presumably to follow up with c2-c4 to prevent d6-d5.} d5 {But I get in first. We are following src36 (1717) vs. the_caboose (2271). http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=23041491&fb=1&mv=20&rnd=0.417476317219698 In that game white makes the mistake of exchanging on d5. My opponent finds a better way. } 12. Ng3 {Protecting e4 again.} Qc7 {Gameknot computer prefers Qd7.} 13. c3 {Trying to limit the advance of black's d pawn.} Rfd8 {Threatening d5xe4 with a discovered attack on the white queen.} 14. Qe2 {So the queen goes. } Rab8 {Natural development, with an attack down the b file.} 15. Rfd1 {He starts to mobilize his rooks too.} c5 {I advance again, planning d5-d4.} 16. exd5 {He takes. } Nxd5 {I take back.} 17. Bxd5 {This exchange looks like a mistake to me. In an open position with pawns on both sides of the board, like this, bishops must be better than knights.} Bxd5 {I take back. Maybe c4 is good for him here, followed by exchanging rooks on the d file?} 18. Nf5 {but he advances with his knight.} Bf8 {Bishop drops back.} 19. Rd2 {Preparing to double rooks on the d file maybe?} Be6 {I attack his knight.} 20. Ng3 {Knight drops back.} Rxd2 {I exchange. My idea is that he can't take with the bishop otherwise the b2 pawn drops.} 21. Qxd2 {So he has to take this way.} f5 {But now his queen blocks his bishop retreat. f5-f4 is a really nasty threat.} 22. f4 {I hate to admit I didn't see this defence. } Bd6 {Adding more pressure to f4. I realised after making this move that g5 would have been a better move. My computer agrees with me.} 23. Ne2 Bc4 {I thought that this was adding more pressure to f4, by attacking the knight that is protecting f4. My computer prefers Rd8.} 24. fxe5 {He exchanges.} Bxe5 {I take back.} 25. Bf4 {He challenges my bishop. My advantage is minimal now! I was planning on taking on e2 now, but then I saw he has Qd5+ and all lines seem to be better for white.} Bxf4 {So I took.} 26. Nxf4 {He takes back.} Rd8 {I attack his queen.} 27. Qf2 {Queen has to protect the knight.} Qd6 {I am now threatening Qd1+ winning. However this threat is easily dealt with, and indeed, even in this position, Qd1+ can be met with Qe1! and there is no great advantage to black. I only considered the replies Rxd1 which loses to Rxd1 forcing Qf1 and the reply Qf1 which loses to Bxf1. I should have just taken advantage of his weak back rank with Bxa2!} 28. h3 {So he gives his king an escape hole.} Qd2 {Now my queen takes up a dominant position and I have an edge again.} 29. Qxd2 {He virtually has to take.} Rxd2 {Now my rook is very active.} 30. b3 {He hits my bishop.} Bb5 {I want to reposition it on the long diagonal.} 31. h4 {He prevents g7-g5, driving away his knight from f4, where it protects g2.} Bc6 {So I continue with my plan. He can't move his knight without losing his g pawn and his rook is tied to defending a2. He is close to running out of moves. } 32. a4 {So he frees up his rook, by moving the pawn it was protecting.} Rc2 {Rb2 was also strong. Notice how my rook and bishop have targets on both sides of the board.} 33. c4 {The only way to save the pawn.} Rb2 {Now I attack the other pawn.} 34. Ra3 {He allows his rook to be tied up protecting the pawn. It was probably better just to let the pawn go and activate his rook. The position is hard to save for white in either case.} Be4 {I can't afford for him to play Nd5 cutting off my attack on g2.} 35. a5 {Trying to give his rook some room.} Kf7 {This is best, although both a7-a6 and Bc2 were both strong too.} 36. a6 {He continues with his plan.} Ke7 {I continue to mobilise my king.} 37. Ra5 {He attacks my c pawn.} Kd6 {So I defend it.} 38. Rb5 {He protects b3 again.} Ke5 {I attack his knight.} 39. g3 {He protects it.} Kd4 {I protect c5 once more, and my king is now a dangerous attacking piece.} 40. Ne6+ {He thinks he is forking my king and g pawn, winning a pawn, but I have seen further. My threats will become overwhelming.} Ke3 {Threatening mate with Rb1 followed by Rh1 mate.} 41. g4 {Played to give his king a flight square on g3. Ok stop and tell me what black should now play?} Rb1+ {Is this what you would have played?} 42. Kh2 {Forced of course.} Kf2 {And now there is no defence to Rh1 mate next move. White resigned.
