[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Byrne (English) attack"]

1. e4 c5 {I faced an opening I had never faced before: the Sicilian Defense.  I like correspondence chess because it's different from normal chess in that you are allowed to use literature and compare your game with other games from other players. So, a completely unknown opening isn't that frightening in correspondence chess. I find this kind of play very instructive, although I wouldn't like to miss either (normal or correspondence chess). So I read up on this famous Sicilian Defense and looked at games in the database to make for a good opening.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {This seems to be the main line of the Sicilian, which I wanted to try first. It looks to me as if this is better for White than many anti-Sicilian lines, although it does lead to interesting chances on both sides.} a6 {At this point, Black has several nice alternatives, all of which lead to very different and interesting games. Namely, there are 5... a6 (Najdorf variation), 5... g6 (Dragon variation), 5... Nc6 (classical variation) and 5... e6 (the Scheveningen). From what I saw and read, it seems to me that 5... a6 is best. It prepares b7-b5 and takes away the b5 square for White's bishop and knights. This is probably also what I would have played if I had been Black. } 6. Be3 {Here the book knows several variations:  The aggressive 6. Bg5 is the old main line, but it seems like it leads to good chances for Black if Black defends carefully. It can in particular lead to the poisoned pawn variation after 6... e6 7. f4 Qb6 which is extremely complex and which I did not wish to face (of course I wouldn't have to play 7. f4). Now I think, maybe this attack is a bit premature, but Black will still have to react to it, so maybe it's not that bad either. I guess, I'll probably try this move next time I'm in this situation.  The Fischer-Sozin variation 6. Bc4 is not good because Black can block the diagonal with 6... e6 and then the Bc4 is of no use and threatened by b7-b5, so White would play 7. Bb3 (as otherwise Black can play b7-b5 then b5-b4 then Nxe4), and already this looks much more comfortable for Black. Black could develop Nbd7 Nc5 if he's aggressive or yet Be7 Bd7 Nc6 to build up a solid defense, so 6. Bc4 just doesn't seem advisable.  The quiet 6. Be2 is just too passive for my taste.  So I decided to go for the English attack 6. Be3. I think it's a good place for the bishop to be (e.g. b6 is not such a good-looking place for the black queen anymore) and it prepares for queenside castling. } e5 {Black has other possibilities such as 6... e6 or 6... Ng4, but I think this is a good move as it gains space in the center, the black e-pawn develops with a tempo and it puts the knight Nd4 in an uncomfortable position. Again, probably what I would have played. } 7. Nb3 {No really good alternative there. 7. Nf3 blocks the f-pawn which will be important to build an attack on the kingside. 7. Ne2 blocks the white-fielded bishop and the queen's d1-h5 diagonal. Finally, 7. Nf5 !? looks very dangerous...} Be6 8. f4 {At this point the book suggests 8. f3, but it just seems to me that White's attack on the kingside is much slower and more difficult to coordinate than Black's attack on the queenside after this move, e.g. 8. (f3) Be7 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O Nbd7 11. g4 b5 12. g5 b4 and so forth. See this excellent annotated game from byakuugan3 for more on this development: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/gambito-339?gm=10746  I did not want to play this line, so I decided to level the playing field a little with the apparently rarely seen 8. f4. I did not find much on it in the literature, but I did not find a refutation either. In my opinion 8... exf4 is the best answer as Black won't want my pawn on f5. Then after 9. Bxf4 White has an isolated e-pawn and Black has an isolated d-pawn, and the chances look more or less equal to me. It's also nice to have the f-file opened so I can maybe play Rf1 later. } Ng4 9. Bd2 {Admittedly, 8... Ng4 is a tempting-looking move and this is exactly what 8. f3 would have prevented. However when taking a closer look, the only thing that this lone knight threatens is my bishp on e3. Of course I could protect him with moves like e.g. 9. Qd2 or 9. Qe2, but I did not want to give Black the (probably good) option to exchange his knight for my bishop, as I thought I would probably still need it to build my attack on the kingside. So I just retreated the bishop to Bd2, and now the black knight is in a bad place.  The only (slight) drawback to this move is that my queen does not control d5 anymore. When playing against a Sicilian, I guess you usually don't want your opponent to be able to boost his queen's pawn to d5, but here d5 is still sufficiently protected with my knight on c3 and my pawn on e4, since Black's knight is not on f6 anymore to control d5. } Nf6 {Maybe this is what my opponent thought when he retreated his knight? But it's not a good move! I think that Black should instead finally play 9... exf4, even though after (9. ... exf4) 10. Bxf4 the situation is essentially the same as it would have been if Black had played exf4 one move sooner, except that now his knight is in a less good position.  But 9... Nf6 leaves me with the option of playing 10. f5, an opportunity which I shall not refuse. } 10. f5 {What else? Advancing the pawn with a tempo towards the kingside pawns, and now Black's white-fielded bishop is much less of a threat... } Bc8 {I think 10... Bd7 is sharper and leaves the option of playing Bc6 later. Now he's lost a lot of development. Maybe he plans on later playing b7-b5 followed by Bb7? But the bishop could achieve essentially the same threat from c6 without the need to play b7-b5 first... } 11. Qf3 {Really the most sensible move I think. It allows for queenside castling, restores the queen's control of d5 (indirectly) and puts the queen in a good position to support my kingside attack. } Be7 12. O-O-O Nc6 13. g4 O-O 14. g5 {Maybe 14. g5 is too quick? 14. Rg1 or even 14. h4 may have been solid alternatives. But I like to play aggressively ;-)} Nxe4 {Sacrificing the knight to win two pawns and take some steam out of my attack. I would probably have played 14... Ne8 or maybe 14... Nd7, but admittely this is a difficult position for Black. } 15. Qxe4 {15. Nxe4 would allow 15... d5 and then after the white knight retreats to one of c3, g3 or f2 Black plays 17. Bxg5 and the g-pawn is lost too, leaving me in a much less comfortable position, so I thought 15. Qxe4 is preferrable.} Bxg5 16. h4 {I don't like the black bishop there, and I can develop the h-pawn with a tempo. After post-game analysis, I think 16. Bd3 would have been much better, but 16. h4 is not a bad move. } Bxd2+ 17. Rxd2 {I use the rook instead of the knight for two reasons: first, maintain control over the d-file and second, having one rook in the first line and another in the second may help to build a quick reinforcement later on. The drawback is that now the rooks don't protect each other after I moved the white-fielded bishop.} Ne7 {Threatening my pawn on f5. This is a good move. I had intended to play Bd3 to reinforce the queen's diagonal towards h7 (and a dangerous attack when followed by my pawn moving to f6), but now after 18. Bd3? follows 18... Bxf5 and the f-pawn is lost. Protecting the pawn with my rook isn't good either: 18. Rf2 could lead to 18... d5 (good move, the d-boost has happened), or maybe even 18... Bxf5 19. Rxf5 Nxf5 20. Qxf5 and the situation is highly interesting with two knights and a bishop on White's side against a rook on Black's side, and with three more pawns on Black's side. Anyway, I didn't want to give my opponent the option of playing 18... d5. } 18. Bh3 {So, I went for the rather defensive move 18. Bh3, giving up the plan of bringing the bishop to d3 for now. Nicely played, Black! At least I had already advanced my h-pawn and so I didn't block it with my bishop, and this way the rook on h1 protected the bishop. } Qc7 19. Nd5 {I liked this move, although I'm not sure if it's completely sound. If 19... Nxd5, then 20. Qxd5 with an attack on the d-pawn. More on that later.  If Black chooses to move the queen, he has to be careful: If 19... Qc6? (threatening to take the white queen if the knight on d5 moves) leads of course to 20. Nxe7+ Kh8 21. Nxc6 and wins. If 19... Qd7 then 20. f6 Nf5 21. Ne7+ Kh8 22. Bxf5 with a dangerous attack. So I guess the only alternative for Black would be to retreat the queen again with 19... Qd8, where I would probably play 20. Rg1 (intending 21. f6) to continue my kingside attack. } Nxd5 20. Qxd5 {Now, I'm threatening to take Black's d-pawn. In my opinion, this was one of the most interesting situations in the game. So I have to tell you my thoughts.  I really thought that Black would play 20... Rd8, the only possible move to protect his pawn (note that 20... Qc6 doesn't help after 21. Qxc6 bxc6 22. Rxd6). Then I would have played 21. Nc5 !? (it's an original move, I was really happy about this idea). Black shouldn't try to take my knight:  If 21... dxc5?? then forced checkmate with 22. Qxd8+ Qxd8 23. Rxd8#.  If 21... Qxc5? then 22. Qxc5 and I win the queen (22... dxc5?? 23. Rxd8#).  Now my knight is in a really good position there on c5 because he can go to e4 (threatening the pawn on d6), or maybe even be sacrificed on e6!  For example, 21... Rb8 is probably Black's strongest answer in that position (planning on b7-b5 or b7-b6 followed by Bb7 to threaten the diagonal where the white queen and rook are). In that case I might have played 22. Ne6 fxe6 23. fxe6 with an attack that has some potential.  Black could also try to move his bishop, e.g. 21... Bxf5. In that case 22. Nxb7 and the black rook on d8 has to move away, after which follows 23. Bxf5 and I win Black's bishop.  If Black is tricky and plays 21... Be6, threatening my queen, then 22. Nxe6 fxe6 and I have the choice between 23. Qxe6+ or 23. fxe6 which are both strong (I'm unsure whether 22. fxe6 would be good because of 22... dxc5).  There are even more variations here and I could go on, but these are some of the most interesting. Therefore I have to say that 20... Rd8 21. Nc5 would have led to an extremely interesting game, and I would have played it just for that, even though I can't possibly have foreseen all consequences.  Unfortunately, my opponent decided otherwise. That's chess! } Bd7 21. Qxd6 {He offers his queen's pawn to me on a silver platter, and I gladly take the chance. The d-pawn can become very strong if Black decides to advance his two center pawns, and now Black has only one extra pawn against my extra knight. Also, my knight is now free to go to c5. This almost forces a queen exchange since I threaten both Black's unprotected queen and his bishop (the only alternative for Black being 21... Qc6, threatening my rook). } Qxd6 22. Rxd6 Bc6 23. Rg1 {Alternatively, 23. Rd1 would have been strong too. However, I decided for 23. Rg1 so I could play f5-f6 in the next move. If 23. (Rg1) f6, then I would probably first chase Black's bishop away (e.g. 24. Na5) followed by Rd7, threatening Black's g-pawn. } Rfe8 24. f6 {Clearly, Black wants to protect his e-pawn and prepare to push him through. I played f5-f6 as intended, with the main idea that after 24... g6 (the only sensible move for Black), Black's f-pawn is blocked and so now his e-pawn is on its own. I have one extra knight, plus a king waiting on the finish line, so it shouldn't be too difficult to stop this pawn. } g6 25. Na5 {Since my rook on g1 is not of much use any longer where he is, I should probably move him to d1. However, I think this can yet wait a bit. Another nice move at this point is 25. Bd7, since this forces Black to trade bishops, if he doesn't want to loose the exchange. However, after 25. Bd7 Bxd7 26. Rxd7 Re6! my f-pawn is in an uncomfortable position. I could try to protect him, but I don't want to be in the defensive. As long as my bishop controls e6, my opponent cannot play Re6, so at the moment I prefer to keep my bishop.  Hence, I went for 25. Na5, for two main reasons: First, this also threatens Black's bishop. Assuming he wants to stay in the main diagonal (and protect b7), he can go to either e4 or f3, where f3 is preferrable because it doesn't block the e-pawn; but both squares are less desirable for him than c6. Second, on my side I can then go on to c4 with my knight, from where he controls e3, e5 and d6, so that my extra knight is really put to some use. } Be4 {He blocked his e-pawn, his only - if desperate - hope to still win this game. I don't understand why he didn't play Bf3, planning on advancing his pawn to e4. My knight, who can go to c4 to threaten e5, is now very dangerous for him, since he cannot simply move the pawn away. Black's only piece protecting the e-pawn is the rook, and now I can easily force that one away by playing Bd7 since Black's bishop doesn't control d7 anymore. Note that even if he's tricky and responds 26. (Bd7) Rad8 (so that after 27. Bxe8 would follow 27... Rxd6), I can still play 27. Nc4 and now my rook on d6 is protected, and Black's rook on the e-file can only retreat back to f8.  I keep Black moving, forcing him to react to my moves, so that he cannot act of his own accord. I'm coordinating my pieces step by step, while Black is pushed in a defensive position increasingly difficult to hold. He certainly neither wanted his bishop blocking the e-file, nor his rook away from the e-file. I have a lot of room and options, while Black's pieces are squeezed together and have a limited number of options. } 26. Bd7 {Black resigned. Good game! }
