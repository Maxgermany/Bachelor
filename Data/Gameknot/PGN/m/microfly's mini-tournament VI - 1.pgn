1. d4 {This is my first annotation.  Comments and critics are encouraged and appreciated!} Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 b6 {This is not one of the more typical defenses, but it is logically.  The fianchetto helps black take advantage of the weak e5 square.} 4. g3 {To bring my white bishop to g2 and help support my white squares.  Nc3 is certainly playable here as well.} Bb7 5. Bg2 c5 {According to the Gameknot DB this is the Torres Attack.  Personally, I think it's very strong.  Black gets c5 off quickly, his LS bishop has lots of room, and generally has a good game.} 6. d5 {This is an aggressive response, and a clever one (I have seen this before and did not find it on the spot).} exd5 7. Nh4 {The d5 pawn is now pinned, and white can recapture at his convenience.} Bd6 {I suppose this is necessary to develop the bishop, but I think that Be7 is better.  Even though the bishop has a longer diagonal on d5, I'm not sure where it's going from there.  Maybe it can come to e5 in the future but that seems to be the only offensive post, and be7 is stronger defensively.} 8. Nc3 {Although I could recapture, I still don't have to, so I strengthen my light squares and develop.} O-O 9. O-O Nc6 {This is what I was hoping for in postponing the recapture.} 10. cxd5 {Recapturing, blocking the black bishop, and gaining time by moving the knight.} Ne7 11. Bg5 {Forcing yet another knight move while developing.} Ng6 12. Nf5 {Although I could have played 12. Nxg3 hxg3 (or fxg3), and disrupted his pawn structure immediately, I decided to maintain tension while adding pressure to the kingside. } Qc7 {This was a tough spot for black, and I can't really say what his best move was, but I don't think it was this.} 13. Bxf6 {Opening up the king.} gxf6 14. Ne4 {There were lots of options, but this seemed like the best to contain the momentum attacking the king } Be5 15. Qd2 {Defending the b2 pawn while threatening 16 Qh6 17 Qg7#, which can only be stopped one way...} Kh8 {and that's it.} 16. Qh6 { } Rfg8 {Forced.} 17. Rad1 {After some debate, I decided that as long as I held the d5 pawn I would keep my opponent's forces separated, and mate would surely ensue.} d6 {Not sure what the thinking was here except maybe to open up the queen's defense along the 7th rank. } 18. f4 {Forcing the bishop move.  No matter where he goes I will eventually push him off of his diagonal. } Bd4+ {Seems like the best move...} 19. Rxd4 {a bit of a sacrifice, but I had actually calculated almost every line and was fairly convinced that mate was guaranteed. } cxd4 20. Nxf6 {The only way he can defend both 21. Qxh7# and 21. Qxg7# is with 20. ... Nf8.} Rg7 21. Qxg7# {This is what was played, but it didn't matter.  Even after 20. ...Nf8 mate is guaranteed after 21. Nxg8.  I thought this was an interesting game, and wanted to share it.  Comments are greatly appreciated!! }
