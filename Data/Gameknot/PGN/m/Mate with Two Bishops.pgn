1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bg5 Ne4 {Immediately challenging this Bishop} 4. e3 Nxg5 {Securing the advantage of the Bishop pair} 5. Nxg5 c6 {Preparing d5 but also containing a tactic that White overlooked} 6. c4 Qa5+ {Winning the g5 Knight} 7. Nd2 Qxg5 8. f4 {White now responds to this early loss of a piece with a frantic pawn push} Qa5 9. a3 Bg7 {Although White's clear intention is to play b4, I thought it better to develop a piece} 10. b4 Qc7 11. Bd3 d5 {Not wanting to be swamped by a pawn avalanche I counter White's centre} 12. O-O O-O 13. f5 {White continuing with his plan of pushing pwans} e5 {Continuing to undermime White's centre.  Although Black's Queenside is undeveloped, with an extra piece and the centre about equal, Black must be better in this position} 14. fxe6 e.p. Bxe6 15. Qf3 {Perhaps 15. e4 is better for White} Nd7 {Eventually developed and connecting the Rooks} 16. cxd5 Bxd5 17. Qf2 Rae8 18. e4 Be6 19. e5 {?!} f6 {White can not prevent the centre opening up after which Black's extra piece will only become increasingly advantageous} 20. exf6 Rxf6 21. Qe2 Rxf1+ {Following the well known strategy of exchanging pieces if you have a material advantage} 22. Rxf1 Bxd4+ 23. Kh1 Qd6 {Placing the Queen on a slightly better square} 24. Nc4 Qe7 25. Qf3 Rf8 26. Qe4 Rxf1+ 27. Bxf1 Bg7 {Although the position is theoretically won for Black, I wasn't at all clear as to how best it should be played out} 28. Nd2 Qd6 29. Nc4 Qd5 30. Qxd5 {? - White's best defense surely invovled keeping Queen's on the board.  With the bishop pair and an extra pawn (and an extra piece) Black's plan is now fairly straight forward} Bxd5 31. Nd6 b5 {Not only moving the pawn away from the Knight but more significantly fixing White's Q-side pawns on dark squares} 32. Kg1 Bb2 33. Bxb5 {?? Utterly unsound} cxb5 34. Nxb5 a6 35. Nc7 Bb3 {A mistake; the correct move was Bc4 protecting the a5 pawn. } 36. Nxa6 Bxa3 37. b5 Bc4 38. Nc7 Bd6 39. b6 Nxb6 40. Ne8 Bc5+ 41. Kh1 Kf7 42. Nc7 {And White's Knight is now trapped} g5 43. h3 h5 44. g3 Nd5 45. Nxd5 Bxd5+ {The Bishop pair already exerting their influence across the board} 46. Kh2 Kf6 47. h4 gxh4 48. gxh4 Kf5 {And now the mate is but a matter of time} 49. Kh3 Kf4 50. Kh2 Kf3 51. Kh3 Kf2 52. Kh2 Be6 53. Kh1 Bd4 {A quiet waiting move} 54. Kh2 Be5+ 55. Kh1 Bd5# {Simple but effective}
