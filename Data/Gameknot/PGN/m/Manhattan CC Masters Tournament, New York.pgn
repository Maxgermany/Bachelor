[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C89), Marshall counter-attack, 11...c6"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Capa played the Ruy Lopez as white often, with tremendous success.  (1 loss in 44 games, and this is not that loss!)} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 {The closed variation, as opposed to the immediate opening of the game with 5. ... Nxe4.} 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O {Usual here is 7. ... d6, protecting the e5 point.} 8. c3 {This is a "normal" move, preparing d4, denying the Nc6 the squares b4 and d4, but it invites the opening of the center...} d5 {Marshall's innovation.  After 8. ... d6, white can choose between 9. d4, allowing the pin Bg4, or 9. h3, where black has many good variations, including Na5 (Chigorin), Nb8 (Breyer's), Bb7 (Zaitsev), Nd7 (Smyslov), and Re8 (a flexible idea).  This move invites white to take a pawn for attacking chances.} 9. exd5 {As this was the first appearance of this gambit, it's worth noting that Capa could've declined it with 9. d4.  Instead, he chose to accept it and walked right into Marshall's little surprise, almost daring him to spring the trap...} Nxd5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Rxe5 {The key point -- black has sacrificed one of his center pawns, but both bishops, the queen, and the knight are poised for an assault on white's kingside, as he is way ahead in development.} Nf6 {This is an excellent move -- preparing to transfer the knight to the kingside where it can join in the attack!  Look at the white pieces -- the rook is about to get attacked, and the white queenside is asleep and blocked in!  Black these days plays either 11. ... Bb7 or 11. ... c6! more commonly, but Nf6 is also a very strong (and my preferred) move.} 12. Re1 {Anticipating black's 12. ... Bd6.  12. d4 and 12. Re2 are also worth considering as defensive options, but 12. Re2 would block the queen's defensive route to the kingside.} Bd6 13. h3 {Trying to keep black's pieces out of g4, where they will menace the white king.} Ng4 {Anyway!  Marshall calculates that on 14. hxg4 Qh4 is deadly!} 14. Qf3 {!  A great defensive move, allowing the queen to help defend.  Note the counterattack threat in this move -- that if the black Bd6 and Qd8 leave the Rf8 undefended, then Qxf7 Rxf7 Re8 is checkmate for white.} Qh4 {I wonder if white is sweating yet?  Again, 15. hxg4 is impossible, as Bxg4 wins after 16. Q-moves, Qh2  17. Kf1 Qh1#.} 15. d4 {Allowing the bishop and knight out of the queenside.  White has met black's audacious threats very accurately so far.} Nxf2 {!  How to continue this attack?  I think this is the best way, as the knight is immune.  (16. Qxf2 is met by Bh2  17. Kf1 [17. Kxh2? Qxf2] Bg3, winning the exchange.)  It is remarkable how deep black is into white's kingside.  Note also that black has won back the gambit pawn.} 16. Re2 {Threatening to win the knight.  It is possible that Re2 would have been better back on the 12th move, saving white a tempo, but getting in the way of 14. Qf3.  As an aside, some say that 16. Bd2 is an even better move for white.  My analysis is that in that case, Ng4! for black looks excellent.  16. Bd2 Ng4 17. g3 Qxh3 18. Qxa8 Bxg3, and black has sacrificed a rook for a tremendous kingside assault.} Bg4 {A difficult move in a difficult position.  I honestly don't know what move I'd make here, as 16. ... Bxh3 and 16. ... Nxh3  don't look too inviting either, and 16. ... Bg3? is checkmate (16. ... Bg3 17. Qxf7 ! Rxf7 18. Re8#)} 17. hxg4 {Forced, as 17. Qxf2 Bg3 18. Qf1 Bxe2 19. Qxe2 Rae8 gives black the advantage.} Bh2+ {Connecting the rooks and continuing the attack, at the cost of a knight.} 18. Kf1 Bg3 {Now the threat is Qh1#.  White must give the exchage back to survive.  Possibly 18. ... Nh8 is good, too.} 19. Rxf2 {!  White decides to give back Rook for knight to break the attack.  } Qh1+ 20. Ke2 Bxf2 {Also possible here was Qxc1, where the game is very much in doubt.} 21. Bd2 {!  Another excellent defensive move.  Note that 21. Qxf2? is met by Qxc1, where black has a big advantage.  21. Bxf7  may also be worth considering.} Bh4 {Saving the bishop, but note that, with the attack now over, black is just down two minors for a rook.  Incredible over-the-board defense by Capablanca!} 22. Qh3 {!  Now, offering a queen exchange works out great for white, and is much better than the alternative 22. Bxf7  Kh8! 23. Be3 Rae8!, and black is winning.} Rae8+ 23. Kd3 Qf1+ {These checks are forced to avoid exchanging queens and to save the black bishop.} 24. Kc2 {The king is quite safe here, and despite all of black's innovation, he has no more tricks up his sleeve.} Bf2 {What else?  Maybe Be1? Of course not 24. ... Re2? 25. Qxh4.  Black is probably despairing now.} 25. Qf3 {!  Pinning the bishop and pressuring f7.} Qg1 26. Bd5 {Threatening to free the knight and rook with 27. Qd1.} c5 {Again, I don't know what else is better.  Once white develops his knight and rook the game is over -- his material advantage is too great.} 27. dxc5 Bxc5 28. b4 Bd6 {Not a great looking move, but again, it's hard to see what could've been better.  Marshall has played excellently, and it's hard to find an improvement.  But Capablanca was just a little bit better.  (Of course, he was just a little bit better than *everybody*.)} 29. a4 {At last, the rook is freed, through quite an unusual chute.  Now white takes over.} a5 {Again, what can black do here?  I look at this and say, "that wasn't very good," but I can't find anything better.} 30. axb5 axb4 31. Ra6 {Looks better than cxb4, as it develops the rook, threatens the bishop, and frees the pin on the knight.} bxc3 32. Nxc3 {"I LIVE" roars the knight!  When was the last time you saw a game where white didn't develop one of his knights until the 32nd move, and won?!  This looks better to me, by the way, than either Bxc3 or Rxd6.} Bb4 {And with the pin of the knight, black takes back control of ... nothing.  Look at this position.  That Rf8 is doing nothing, while all of white's pieces are ready for an attack.  Maybe black's plan was to exchange as much as possible?  Unfortunately, that passed pawn on b5 is looking pretty menacing...} 33. b6 {...did I say menacing?  Make that terrifying...} Bxc3 34. Bxc3 h6 35. b7 {...terrifying?  Make that petrifying...} Re3 {Again, not a good looking move, but what else does black have?} 36. Bxf7+ {!!  Black resigned at this point, as mate is imminent.  An amazing over-the-board refutation of a brilliant gambit.  The finish is 36. ... Rxf7 37. b8Q  Kh7 38. Rxh6  Kxh6 39. Qh8  Kg6 40. Qh5#.}
