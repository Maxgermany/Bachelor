1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 {Caro-Kann} 3. Bd3 {I haven't seen this before...} dxe4 4. Bxe4 Nf6 {Standard development} 5. Bf3 {Takes away a good spot for his knight. I don't think this is a good move.} Bf5 {Getting my bishop out into the fray before moving the knight to d7.} 6. Ne2 {development, although i think f3 would of been a more appropriate spot for the Knight than the Bishop.} e6 7. Nd2 {Again, i think this is passive and that the Knight would be better at c3.} Nbd7 8. c3 Rc8 {My original idea was to advance the c pawn. In hindsight, i'd probably of simply developed my bishop.} 9. O-O Bd6 10. Nc4 {Opens up his bishop and attacks mine. } Qc7 {I figure if he wants the bishop bad enough he can initiate the trade.} 11. Nxd6+ {And he did. Personally i don't mind the exchange, despite losing the bishop pair.} Qxd6 12. Bf4 {Solid move... gets his other bishop into the fray.} Qe7 {So my position is a little passive, however the pawn structure is real solid and there aren't any glaring weaknesses aside from a possible attempt to control the d6 square.} 13. h4 {Interesting move. It looks like an attempt at a king side pawn storm, although this move messes with the integrity of his castle.} Nd5 {Moving to a more active square and threatening the Knight/Bishop exchange. There is also a discovered attack on h4.} 14. Bg3 {Protects the h pawn and moves away from the Knight's scope.} Nd7f6 {Connecting the knights. My intention is to get those knights advanced up the board. Right now i'm looking at the e4 square.} 15. Nf4 Ne4 {So my knights are in pretty active positions. I'm thinking the position is relatively even.} 16. Nxd5 cxd5 {So a quick reflection on this move. I'm wondering if it was a mistake to take with the c pawn instead of the e pawn. I didn't want my queen right in front of the king on an open file and a potential pile up on my knight. However, after Qa4+ i am down a pawn.} 17. Qa4+ Qd7 18. Qxa7 {So while i'm down a pawn, i believe i am compensated by removing his bishop pair and further degrading the integrity of his castle.} Nxg3 19. fxg3 {so despite a pawn deficit, i believe my stronger pawn structure will provide compensation in the end game. Now my goal is to get my rooks connected and over on the queen side. My bishop despite being "bad" is outside my pawns. I believe the position is roughly equal.} O-O 20. Qb6 Qc6 {exchanging queens here would give me a better pawn structure and i'd be able to move my rooks into the semi-open b and a files.} 21. Qxc6 bxc6 22. Rfe1 Rca8 23. Re2 {? I'm not sure about the purpose of this move. } Bd3 {So despite being a pawn down, i believe the activity of my pieces is giving me an advantage in this position.} 24. Rd2 Bc4 25. b3 {?? apparently he doesn't see the pin. Free pawn.} Bxb3 {Gimme that pawn.} 26. Rb2 Rfb8 {Again, the pin is still there so there is no rush to move the bishop. Instead i am going to keep the open files contested.} 27. Bd1 {I believe after this exchange my position is better. I will have control of the only fully open file.} Bxd1 28. Rxb8+ Rxb8 29. Rxd1 Rb2 {Rooks are always good on the seventh rank. If he moves the pawn than i will be able to get behind the passed pawn.} 30. Ra1 {forced in order to keep the passed pawn advantage.} Rc2 {Using this as an opportunity to gain some material. I will still be able to get my rook in front of the passed pawn, blocking it from promotion. After that it is only a matter of getting my king into play.} 31. a4 {Passed pawns need to be pushed, although i'm not worried about it.} Rxc3 {converting my positional advantage into a material one.} 32. a5 Rb3 {So i nabbed a pawn real quick, now it's time to get that pawn blocked.} 33. a6 Rb8 34. Kf2 {Trying to get his king into play. However, it is too late. The pawn is all but gone.} Kf8 {Getting my king over into the action.} 35. Ke3 Ra8 36. Kd3 Ke7 37. Kc3 Kd7 38. Kb4 Kc7 39. Kc5 {So with the kings and major pieces in gridlock on one side of the board, it is now time to start advancing my pawns on the kingside.} f6 40. Kb4 {? i don't see the purpose of this move but at the same time i don't really see anything else he can do.} Kb6 {pushing the king away from the pawn.} 41. a7 {There is no need to immediately take as an exchange would leave my king in the corner of the board. In retrospect, i'm wondering if it would of been alright to exchange?} e5 {With this, my opponent resigned, leaving the message "missed an easy win". I'm still not quite sure what he meant by that.}
