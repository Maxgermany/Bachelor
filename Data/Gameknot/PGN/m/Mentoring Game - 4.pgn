1. e4 {At this point, he said, "Game on. I always have much hope in the beginning."  Then I said, that's a good thing.  And, it's always good to be optimistic.  } e6 {So, black decides to respond with the French Defense.  } 2. d4 {Standard as it opens up lines for an attack.} d6 {?! At this point, I said, so, this is the move you played. Believe it or not, the most common is 2...d5. After which, pawns are exchanged. So, then comes 3.exd5, exd5. This move, however, blocks in your DSB (Dark Square Bishop), so that you'll have to cram it, or waste tempii to get it out.  Then he said, "My thought was to possibly develop my knights and force you to make the attack.  I am thinking pretty far out of the box, I know. I will soon assess how aggressive your play will be."  Then I told him that, the interesting thing is that thinking ahead is always a good thing. The only thing to be aware of is that when planning in advance, calculation is also important. Because one can think but at the same time, miss something that's important.} 3. Nf3 {So, I decide to take advantage of my opportunity to develop a piece.} Nf6 {Black decides to do the same thing.  But, as usual there's more to this then meets the eye because he has a plan which I am about to stop.} 4. Bg5 {So, I decide to pin his N, as opposed to, develop my LSB right away.  I know what he's up to.  In it, I said, I think I know what you wanted, in this postion. But, the idea is to expect the unexpected. What if, your opponent plays something that you didn't expect. Like, for example, you were thinking along the lines of 4.e5!? with the idea being that we exchange, I reattack, you force a Q exchange which would take away my opportunity to castle, and then your N retreats. So, 4.e5, dxe5 5.dxe5, Qxd1+ 6.Kxd1 But, what's good to keep in mind, as GM Judit Polgar said in the Alkehine Tournament is to try and get your opponent out of the comfort zone. Meaning: that in general, you don't want to play something that your opponent is comfortable with. Now, the thing about 4.e5 is that I'm familiar with it because something like that has happened in a couple of my past games.  But, let's suppose this happened. 4.e5?!, dxe5. Instead of taking back with 5.dxe5, white could recapture with 5.Nxe5, so there's more to a story then meets the eye. This is very difficult to do, and on rare occasions, I still make this error. But, a good idea is to, "be a spectator of your game", as easy19 puts it. This means to look at the entire board, and not just one move on there.  Then he said, "That was the better case scenario, but not at all what I expect. I do, in fact, expect the unexpected from a more advanced player. You as white are one move ahead, I need to stay aware of cross attacks at c6"} h6 {Most common way of breaking a pin, in this position, is 4...Be7.  But, there is nothing wrong with this choice.} 5. Bxf6 {So, I told the1trueseeker that in this position, I would normally retreat by playing Bh4, as a direct result.  If 5.Bh4, g5 6.Bg3. This is commonly played. So, normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but the issue here is that you would win a free pawn because of 6...Nxe4. So another common variation is to exchange your B for my N. BTW, while this is a common way to break the pin, most common is 4...Be7 as it also develops a piece, at the same time.  Then he said, "Had I been truly concerned for the pawn at e4 kings bishop d3 would have been my choice defensively. It would have blocked my knight and kept your bishop in play. For me, I had two simple choices since your bishop was attacking my queen. I could have broke ranks and doubled up pawns in file f or moved my queen into a prominent position, but also vulnerable for the e4-e5"} Qxf6 {At this point, he said, "If you have the time, lets do some consecutive moves. I'm a little ADD and on games that show few moves I forget my original ideas and get lost in the mire. I'm a little at a disadvantage after polishing off quite a few glasses of whiskey. Bird Dog Peach if you are familiar with the fine taste of two worlds of flavor. It's not too expensive, but much like a fine wine over ice... LOL"  Then I said, Yes, but the move you played, in general, is better then doubling pawns. It all has to do with pawn structures. Sometimes, believe it or not, doubled pawns can benefit, but around the K, it's generally not a good idea, as it could leave it vulnerable to exposure. And, if it helps you learn, sure, I'll do some of the consecutive moves. The question is how do we do that?} 6. Nc3 {Then he said, "It may be extremely hard to do. I could see that you were online last night and had my update alarms set to signal moves made. I was in a good mood to play. Not tired as I am tonight... Regardless, I will try to stay focused and analyze my moves more carefully than I sometimes do in games. I will many times take less than 30 seconds to review a board and choose my move. If I were a master that might seem more reasonable, but as a beginner, not so much so!"} Nc6 {And, "Both boards look good at this point, except you are down a bishop and I a mighty knight. I am certain that at any time you may do something to upset this fragile peace."  So, I said the idea behind that exchange is that, if I didn't take, but instead retreated, I would have been down a pawn. The idea is, "Don't give things away." And, this is a well known fact. The reason being is that although we're no where near that phase, towards the end, and generally in an endgame, both players are left with a few pawns and the K. Now, one pawn is usually enough to make or break a game, as it is the thing that often promotes.  } 7. Bb5 {Then he said, "This is really where I fall short. If I continue to pursue your bishop or go for an attack on your knight, I will affect my defense. I am posturing to castle although I hate to castle prior to my opponent."  So, I accurately told him that there's nothing wrong with that. The idea is to castle, ASAP, but it's not too late for you to castle, in this position.  The problem right now, however, is that your DSB is jammed, which is why ...e5, was better then ...e6.} a6 {Like before, he plays this in an attempt to break the N pin.} 8. Ba4 {This time, however, since no pawn is left en-prise afterwards, I retreat.} b5 {Standard.} 9. Bb3 {Standard.} Be7 {Now, his bishop being crammed, this is not a bad move as it develops another piece and prepares him to castle.  The question is will black castle?  That remains to be seen.} 10. O-O {Meanwhile, that's exactly what I decide to do.} g5 {I don't know why he played this.} 11. d5 {But, I decided to do something which I'm known for doing.  Quizzing people.  As you see, in this position, both his N and e pawn are both attacked.  There is, however, a way to keep everything even and avoid losing material.} exd5 {?? This time, he failed my quiz, which is something that I absolutely enjoy about teaching since it is a way for the student.  In it, I said, ? As it turns out, this move was a quiz. And, this move is a mistake because of what's about to come, in the next several moves.  Actually, I just looked at it, and this move is actually a serious blunder. The idea here is that what I recently learned from my coach. Sometimes, when material is attacked, it's better not to try fancy (capturing immediately). It's better to run away. The idea is to think about the positions and after getting rid of one attack, can anything else be attacked or captured, in that position.  So, @the1true seeker: Better was move the N out of harm's way, either by attacking my f3 N or retreating it.  Because of this move, in a few moves from now, I am going to win free a pawn and R.} 12. Nxd5 Qxb2 13. Nxc7+ {Then he said, "I am intriqued and angered that I did not see this fork coming. But, that is why I am not very successful."} Kd7 14. Nxa8 {Now, he asked, "Are you talking about your move as a serious blunder or mine? I had actually considered allowing you to capture the knight. But that was a difficult decision"  Then I said, it's not that. In many respects, you are successful. What it is might just be your main weakness, and if so, this how to turn that weakness into a strength. Plus, it's also a learning experience and how you learn from your mistakes. That's why were here and reason that I enjoy mentoring.  Actually, what I meant is that your previous move, so 11...exd5?? was a blunder.  Then he said, "Oh yes, I understand. agreed, Then I move my Queen impulsive and aggressive."} Qf6 {I don't know why he retreated, as his Q was not in danger here.} 15. Nb6+ {At this point, he said, "Damn, caught again..."   So, I said, no problem. It's called hyperfofcus, and until recently, this was also one of my main weaknesses. Where, you think a lot about one thing, but in exchange miss the threat. The idea, as noted, is to see the entire board because everything in chess is important. The other thing is that we all mistakes, but that's how you learn.  And, he said, "Understood. Now I don't want to get queen lost in a trap.  I am looking hard, but still don't see a valid attack from your queen. Who I am most concerned and focused on at this point. I think my greatest deficit is getting confused on the multitude of moves that another can make. I honestly only see formations."  So, my reply was, that can happen, I know what you're saying. The idea is to focus on your opponents and your plans. The best way to avoid confusion is by using the analyze the board feature. It really makes your mind work and play with different positions to decide the best move or what the situation is.} Kc7 {Now, I said, ?? This is another serious blunder, and that's because of what's about to come. Best was 15...Kd8. Not only does that alleviate your K exposure to some extent, but, at the same time it also protects your LSB, so that you wouldn't lose anything else. But, you said that you get confused on the amount of move one can make. Instead, of getting confused, it's important to think about that and take things into consideration. Don't let your mind get confused like that, as it could cause problems, as is the case here.  In fact, @the1trueseeker: This is the losing blunder.} 16. Nd5+ {And, that's because of this move.} Kd7 17. Nxf6+ {Now, he said, "This is like my head kicking me in the gonads. Blunder after blunder, and I still fail to see anything to really build upon. Before losing the queen I still felt like my position was defensible."  While the game is now lost, I decided to give Kevin some encouragement to prevent him resigning.  Why?  Because you learn by staying in the game, even if it is a lost position.  The idea is, "Don't give up right away.  Study the positions".  So, I decided that by staying in there was more that I could actually teach me student.  In that, I said, Don't give up hope, yet. That's because while it might appear lost, sometimes you can pull a swindle, which means draw or even win a lost game. And, don't get upset with yourself because we're here for you to learn and making these kinds of mistakes is also a good learning experience for you. Another thing is that getting angry can lead to more mistakes, so it's best to stay calm and see what else you can learn. That's one of the beauties of chess.  I did this with the smiley face.} Bxf6 {So, he said, "Much easier said than done."} 18. e5 {That's when I told him, that's true, but in general, it's always a good idea to believe in yourself, no matter how bad the situation. In this position, that will be very difficult, but in general, the idea is to find a way out of trouble and not let yourself get nervous. Because the idea is that if you believe in yourself, you can make it through a very difficult. This applies in chess and in life.} Bg7 {So, he said, "Yes, this is true. Thank you."} 19. Qxd6+ {And then, "I certainly rely on others making errors larger than my own. In a recent team game I just won, I made an overly apparent checkmate move that could have been defended easily. Instead he attacked at a different area nearly drawing my attention away from the simple checkmate. Had I not gone back a few moves, to see what I was doing, I would have surely missed it. I have been diagnosed with ADD, which is why chess is an exercise in concentration. I have the ability for extreme concentration, but if there are distractions, boom, it's lost"} Ke8 {That's when I said, that's actually a good thing. And, it will help you to improve. The idea being that you want to figure out, if your opponent has a weakness, and if so, how to take advantage of it. Chess is also about excercising your mind, which is why it's also a sport. It's not anything like basketball or softball, physically, but it is like it mentally. In that, it makes you really concentrate and work your mind. I also agree that it's a good idea to avoid distractions, if possible. One way I like to prevent this is by taking breaks, when I see that it's about to come.} 20. Qxc6+ Bd7 {So, after my last move, this was a conditional move.  The idea was to chase my Q away.  But, @the1trueseeker: As I'm about to illustrate there's more to chess then attacking material.} 21. Qxa6 {And, this is the example.} g4 {Now, Kevin said, "Back to the original point, I went from a rating in the 1100's which I felt was likely a fair rating. I have sunk to a rating in the low 900's and it honestly hit my ego quite hard. Regardless of my ADD, I am intelligent and articulate, but my ego had me very near the point of giving up on chess... But, I am not a quitter.... whether fortunate or not, I want to power through my lack of attention to detail, become less impulsive, learn to be able to 1,2,3 analyze and make better choices in moves... I will need to slow down, for now, but speed will improve over time."} 22. Rfd1 {So, I said with another smiley face, you actually are very intelligent and have showed some of that. Don't quit and always try the best that you can. And, now I understand. In general, playing too many games is not good. You said that you had 30 in progress, at one point. This is the only thing I ever disagreed with a mentor. And, for about a month, a little over a year and a half ago, I believe it was, I had about the same rating that you have. I used to play a lot, and at one point, my average time per move was only 16 minutes. There is a lot to absorb and digest, in chess, and playing too much and too quickly limits, and sometimes, prevents you from concentrating. Playing too many cause can cause stress, which, essentially, causes rushing. Now, concentration is key. But, in my mind, you're doing the right thing and figuring what the problem is. This will also help you to improve.  } gxf3 {?? My last move was actually a blunder because of this.  The idea was that mate was soon to follow after 23.Qa8+, where I was planning a mate in 3.  But, as you're about to see, I was not thorough in my thought process and, henceforth, miscalculated.  And, thinking that mate is soon to follow without actually knowing is not good enough.} 23. Qa8+ {So, I started my plan from earlier with this move.} Ke7 {Best.  His only other option was 23...Bc8, but then I would mate him immediately with 24.Qxc8#.} 24. Qb7 {So, I come up with a different plan.  This one pins his LSB, and there's no way to break it, this time.} Rg8 {Now, I told him that, ?? all I can say here, is that this move was a very serious blunder because of what's about to come. Instead, best was 24...Rd8.  I couldn't give him information, because I felt that black would resign, if I did.  So, it was about letting him figure it out, as I mate him.  My idea is that even if a game is lost, I don't want my students to resign because this is a training game, so there's still a little more to learn.} 25. Qxd7+ {So, he said, " very much understood. I could only hope for a miscue on your behalf in order to have any hope of success."} Kf8 {Now, he figured it out what I am going to do by saying, "I was three moves away from a threat to your king.  but still good checkmate."} 26. Qxf7# {Overall, the1trueseeker is a very good student, and as noted earlier, very intelligent.  He has already showed improvement in his games, and I can see him making even more and easily hitting a rating back up to 1100.  @the1trueseeker: One of the most important things to remember is what you told me.  Instead of getting confused, analyze and concentrate on the positions.  In addition, don't play too fast or too many games at one time.  Aside from that, I think that you're rating will easily shoot back up to where it was, and then some.}
