[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c6 3. Nf3 {A principle says that when black moves this pawn, I have to move mine c pawn to, in order to provide room for  my Q to b2 in case of Qb6. I missed this "on purpose", to test some ideas similar to a game I was engaged in, where I missed by mistake the c pawn movement. } b5 {My opponent went for this quick pawn's storm. } 4. Nbd2 {Somewhat surprised, but liking the challenge. } a5 {! Even better! Now I could test the overexpansion. } 5. c3 Bb7 6. Qc2 {Threatening e4, that my opponent missed. } e6 {Much better was d5, preventing e4. } 7. e4 c5 {Counterattacking, probably the foreseen countermove to e4. } 8. Bd3 {Inviting c4, Be7, and the situation is more controlled, but not good for white. } cxd4 {?? thanks! My opponent helps me to open the game when I'm squeezed. } 9. Nxd4 {A more active piece. The for, d5 is not possible without a support for it. } b4 {It seems very strong, but what does it threat?} 10. Nc4 {I just ignore it, because my N has a wonderful spot on d3. } bxc3 11. Nd6+ Bxd6 {Virtually forced. } 12. Bxd6 {What an outpost! If Qb6 now, e5 and let's see what happens. } cxb2 {Embarassing, but also opening the column for my Q (as foreseen). } 13. Rb1 {! Black has just nothing now!} Qb6 14. Bc5 {No escape for the Q but...} Qc7 15. Nb5 Qf4 16. Nd6+ Ke7 17. Nxb7+ {And here my opponent resigned, in sight of d6, Bxd6+, or similar. }
