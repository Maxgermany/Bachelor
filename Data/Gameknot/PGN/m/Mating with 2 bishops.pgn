1. d3 d5 {Queen's pawn moving} 2. Bg5 {This stops Nf6 but I can still move f6.} h6 {No, a6's better.} 3. Bd2 {The bishop returns} e5 {Two strong pawns in the centre controlling d4 and e4.} 4. e3 {And the e2 pawn pushes its way.} Bf5 {Good by me} 5. e4 {Just what I thought but that's a very bad move.} dxe4 6. dxe4 Bxe4 {Here we go and it pins the bishop and d2, or well, at least it sort of does} 7. Ne2 {The king can't castle now.} Nf6 8. f4 {f4? Strange move} exf4 9. Nxf4 Qe7 {Now, trying to maje a discovered check.} 10. Be3 {Doesn't look good for white} Qe5 {Chase the knight away, } 11. Nh3 {and my aim is'nt Qxb2, it's} Bxg2 {Close look at that. So that's why I chased the knight away.} 12. Rg1 {Blunder....} Qxe3+ {A fork?} 13. Qe2 {Have you ever seen such a thing like that. The white queen can't take my bishop and my queen can't take the knight. We pin each other. The world of pins arrive.} Qxe2+ {So I just need to take the queen for the heck of it.} 14. Bxe2 {And it loses presure on my bishop.} Bxh3 {And I'm as good as a pie.} 15. Nc3 {I can pin the knight now, can't I?} Bb4 16. Rxg7 {Oops! Made a mistake.} Nbd7 {Protect Knights} 17. Rg3 {Good.} Bf5 18. h4 {Hmmm.} Nc5 19. Kd1 {Getting out of the pin. O-O-O would've been a lot better.} O-O-O+ {Checking when Castling. Cool!} 20. Ke1 Nce4 {This will be funny. Will you look at that!} 21. Re3 {Cha!} Rd2 {Limiting the king's space} 22. h5 {Terrible blunder.} Rhd8 {Two rooks can joins up easily. Black is winning.} 23. Rc1 {The missing thing was a3!} Bc5 {Chase away the rook.} 24. Rf3 {Just as I expected.} Bg4 {Again} 25. Rh3 {Don't you know it's threatened there?} Bf2+ {Mate in 2. 1.} 26. Kf1 Bxh3# {Checkmate}
