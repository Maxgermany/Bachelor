[Opening "QGD Slav (D15), 4.Nc3"]

1. d4 {Hi everyone, this game was part of a training match for an upcoming tournament. Played O.T.B., without use of a Game DB or openings book. } d5 2. c4 c6 {The Slav Defence, my opponent's favourite reply against 1.d4. } 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 {The Meran complex contains a large number of variations. The Meran variation of the Semi-Slav Defense is reached when after 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 black plays 4...e6. } 5. e3 {The most played move. Another possibility is 5.Bg5 when black can play 5... dxc4, the Botvinnik variation. For more on that variation take a look at the annotated game by chessy131: Semi-Slav: Botvinnik variation chessy131 (2008) vs. be8ki (2100)  } Nbd7 {Black follows the main line too. } 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 {This is the main line of the Meran. } 8. Bd3 {Now black has three main options: 8... a6, 8... Bb7 or the Neo-Meran with 8... b4. } a6 {But we'll stick to the main line. } 9. e4 {The next moves are all theory. } c5 {Only move. } 10. e5 {White gains control in the centre. } cxd4 {So black has to reply. } 11. Nxb5 {Best move. } axb5 12. exf6 Qb6 {An 'improvement' on the old fashion line with 12...Bb7! The game Botwinnik-Simagin, Russian Championship 1951, continued with 13.O-O gxf6 14.Bxb5 Rg8 15.Bf4 Ra5 16.a4 Rxb5! 17.axb5 Ne5 18.Bxe5 fxe5, with good play for black. } 13. O-O {? 13.fxg7 is suggested by theory and considered slightly better then the text-move. } Nxf6 {? My opponent leaves all theory behind and duly gets punished by making the first mistake. 13... gxf6 would still have been a theoretically known position. } 14. Nxd4 {! Capturing an important central pawn. The knight is protected by a discovered check on b5. } Bd7 {Protecting the isolated b5 pawn and eliminating the check, so now the knight on d4 is no longer protected. } 15. Nf3 Bd6 {Developing pieces. } 16. b3 {16.Be3 followed by something like 16... Qb8 was another possibility I looked at, but I decided to fianchetto my bishop to b2, setting up a double-barreled shotgun with the bishops. } Nd5 {Black could have done the same with 16... Bc6!? and equalise the position, but the text-move is less accurate, in my opinion. } 17. Bb2 {Now white definitely has some advantage, since the white bishops are more powerful then their black counterparts. } O-O {Black avoids the capture on g7 by castling, leaving white a lot of space on the king side, but how to continue? } 18. Ng5 {This is the move I spend the most time on during the game. I wanted to set up an attack and since this move threatens the pawn on h7 it is the most forcing. Then again, the knight can still be easily chased away by 18... h6, so I almost discarded the idea, but then I saw something which convinced me that I had to play the move and so I gently moved my knight to g5. } h6 {As expected. } 19. Qh5 {The only move to keep the advantage, though with correct defence I think black should be OK.  } Nf4 {But this is a blunder by my opponent, unfortunately for him, he didn't see the move which had convinced me to play 18.Ng5 in the first place. The text-move looks tempting ofcourse, black wants to eliminate the strong bishop op d3 and it seems he can, since the white queen is also under attack, but now my opponent had a wake up call. } 20. Qxh6 {!! It's all over. Black can resign now ofcourse, but... } gxh6 {My opponent sportingly allowed me to say a chess-player's favourite word... } 21. Bh7# {'Checkmate!'. }
