1. c4 d5 {...Unusual manoeuvre......} 2. d4 {I choose to going on with my opening, instead of protecting my c-file pawn.} dxc4 3. Nf3 b5 4. a4 h6 5. e4 Bg4 {He chooses to not protect his pawn too, but the situation is a little bit different from mine, a few moves ago.} 6. axb5 Nf6 7. Nc3 {I could move Nd2, Bxc4 or Be2.} e6 8. Bxc4 Bb4 9. Qd3 O-O 10. O-O {Castles.} Nbd7 11. Bf4 Nh5 12. Bd2 Bxf3 13. Qxf3 Ndf6 {He decides to protect his N with his other Knight. (??????)} 14. e5 Nh7 15. Qxh5 Qe7 16. Bd3 c5 17. bxc6 e.p. {I was thinking to Bxh6 too, threaning #.} a5 18. Rfc1 Rac8 19. Ne4 Bxd2 20. Nxd2 Qb4 {Now he threatens Qxb2, Qxd2 and Qxd4.} 21. Rc2 f5 {But maybe he fears a combo by my Bishop and my Queen....} 22. c7 {but now I'm preparing Ba6...} Qxd4 23. Ba6 {Indeed...} Qxe5 24. Bxc8 Rxc8 25. Rac1 Nf6 26. Qf3 Nd5 27. Nc4 {Threatining Q and pawn.} Qxc7 {Qxc7?} 28. Nxa5 {Nxa5? Maybe this move can seem right. But analyzing more the position I saw a better move for me was Na3, because now Qxc2, Rxc2 and Rxc2. In that way black threatens # too....} Qxa5 {But, luckily, he doesn't see it.} 29. Rc2xc8+ Kh7 30. Rb8 Nf6 31. Qa8 {I'm trying to keep the Qs off.} Qd2 32. Rh8+ Kg6 33. Qc6 Qe2 34. Rb8 Kf7 35. f3 Qe3+ 36. Kf1 {Kf1? Kh1!} Qd3+ 37. Ke1 Qe3+ 38. Kf1 Qd3+ 39. Kg1 Qe3+ 40. Kh1 {Indeed...} h5 41. Rb6 g5 42. Qxe6+ {Qxe6? I thought I could win even losing 4 points.....Now I told him:  -"Don't worry, I'm not crazy". He answered me: -"That is what worries me, that you may not be crazy!- !} Qxe6 43. Rxe6 Kxe6 44. b4 Nd7 45. b5 Kd5 46. Rc2 Nb6 47. Kg1 g4 48. fxg4 hxg4 {Useless exchange.} 49. Kf2 f4 50. h3 gxh3 51. gxh3 {Useless exchange again.} Ke4 52. Rc6 Nd7 53. b6 Kd5 54. Rh6 Nc5 55. Rh5+ Kc6 56. Rxc5+ {Rxc5?! Now if black takes my pawn I'll win with my rook. If he takes my rook, I'll promote and win with the Q. So, black is over. In fact...} Kxb6 57. Rc1 {he resigns. Not too hard game, but it's been a good one, too. What do you think?}
