1. e4 h6 2. Bc4 Rh7 {Nonsense. But what can you expect from a program that moves randomly.} 3. Qf3 {I would never use this opening on a human being. I hate it. I feel that is cruel to TRUE beginners, and insulting to anyone with a skill level of beyond that. But since the monkey is just a computer program, I feel ok about hurting its feelings.} f6 {Maybe it does have some knowledge of how to meekly postpone a checkmate?} 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxg6+ {Checkmate in 5! Man defeats monkey again! As students learn to checkmate in this way, they will enjoy taking on the monkey in this way. This second victory, has left me with just one last question about the monkey...is it even POSSIBLE to lose to it? (This will be answered in game 3.)} Rf7 6. Qxf7# {Errr...this is the actual checkmate...that was embarrassing.}
