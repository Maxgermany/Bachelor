1. d4 {Hello! I decided to annotate this game, which was a tough one, actually played against a team mate of mine! The team is Yeshua´s Army, one of Gameknot six Christian teams. Anyway, I started with 1. d4, I like to play the Queens Gambit pretty much nowadays. My opponent answered with d5. } d5 2. c4 {c4, the Queens gambit move.} e6 {Now is it Queens Gambit Declined, QCD. As far as I have read in the theory books, this move is better than accepting the gambit.} 3. cxd5 exd5 4. Nf3 {Just playing standard opening moves.} Nf6 5. e3 a6 6. Bd3 c5 7. O-O Nc6 {If I was Black, I had choosen 7... c4 instead with space advantage!} 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. Nc3 O-O {After we both have castled, it´s even.} 10. b3 Bg4 11. Be2 Bxf3 12. Bxf3 Ne7 13. Bb2 {Occupying the a1-h8-diagonal with my DSB. For you that don´t know what this shortening means, it´s the Dark Squared Bishop! Aiming towards the Black King , of course it´s some pieces in the way, but they will sooner or later be removed!} Rb8 14. Na4 Qd6 15. Nxc5 Qxc5 {After this last exchange, I have the bishop pair and my opponent two knights. According to the chess theory it´s a small advantage!} 16. Bxf6 {Suddenly, I saw that i could exchange my dark squared bishop for one of my opponents knights! Furtrhermore that knight was not protected by any piece, only by a pawn. That means that after my opponent has striked back with his g-pawn, it will appear a hole in the pawn shield in the front of his king! To demolish the pawn shield in front of the enemy king is, as far as i know, a greater advantage than the bishop pair. So I gave the bishop pair up, because of this new, greater advantage. So must you think in chess.} gxf6 17. Qd3 f5 {17...f5 was a good move, it somehow defends the Black King from threats alongside the diagonal b1-h7!} 18. Rfd1 Rfd8 19. Rd2 b5 20. Rc2 Qd6 21. Rd1 Rd7 22. Qe2 {Trying to replace my pieces in optimal positions. I want to triple on the d-file, with Queen and two Rooks. Furthermore, my light-squared bishop is also aiming against Blacks d5-pawn. that means that Black will be tied up with the defense of that pawn.} Qe5 23. Rcd2 Rbd8 24. Rd2d3 Rd7d6 25. Rd1d2 Kg7 26. Qd1 {Finally, I have reached my desired position. But this is not enough, because Black can defend properly. Now it´s time for me to create a new weakness, according to the theory of the two weaknesses, well known in the chess theory!} f6 {Blacks position is rather passive.} 27. g3 h6 28. Rd3d4 Kh7 29. Bg2 Kg6 30. Qf3 {Now I´m also aiming against Blacks f5-pawn. The theory of the two weaknesses!} Kh7 31. Bh3 Rg8 32. Qd1 Rgd8 33. Bg2 Kg6 34. e4 {Maybe not the most innovative move in the position, but I couldn´t find any stronger!} fxe4 35. Bxe4+ f5 36. f4 {Gaining a tempo with threat against Blacks Queen. Is also fixing Blacks f5-pawn.} Qe6 37. Bg2 {Material it is even, but maybe I have got a small positional advantage here? But it´s not easy to know how to best proceed from here!} h5 {? Not a good move, creates another pawn weakness for Black!} 38. Re2 Qf7 39. Bf3 {Starting to pressure along the d1-h5 diagonal. } Kh6 40. a4 {The game seems a little bit locked on the kings-side, so therefore I will try to provoke a new pawn weakness for Black on the queens-side!} Nc6 41. Rdd2 b4 42. Re3 a5 {The game bears the stamp of slow manuevering, in this stage.} 43. Kf2 Ne7 44. Bxh5 {Maybe the breakthrough, at last? I wins a pawn, thanks to this tactics!} Qf6 45. Be2 d4 46. Re5 {I´m aiming at both Blacks a- and f-pawns, forcing Black to passively defend. } Nc6 47. Rc5 {Better was b5.} d3 {A great tactics by Black here, if I escape with my bishop here, Black will give a check on d4 in the next move and then win my undefended Rook on c5 for free!} 48. Rxc6 {I found that this little sacrifice was the only solution! Better than lose a whole Rook anyway!} Rxc6 49. Bf3 {Now am I quality under. } Qd4+ 50. Kg2 Rc3 {Now it doesn´t looks so fine out for me! I have got a very passive, crampy game and is also a quality under!} 51. Qe1 Rd6 52. g4 {A  pawn move that opens up the diagonal e1-h4 for a counterattack with my Queen.} fxg4 {Better was to escape with the King to a safer square!} 53. Qh4+ {Now I get a pretty nasty check!} Kg7 54. Qe7+ Kh6 55. Be4 Rf6 {He totally missed the checkmate in the next move with Qh7#.} 56. Qh7# {Checkmate! This was a really hard game between two Christian team players. Have tolerance with me if my comments not is of a very high standard, but I have tried to give my opinions about the game, after my best ability!}
