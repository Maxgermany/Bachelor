1. e4 {This is my match vs. Argentine GM Pablo Zarniki who came to a local university chess club and offered $10 for a game (or 3 games for $20) against a grandmaster! The tables were set up so that he could walk around the 25 or so boards to play against everyone simultaneously making a move and then moving on. So I bought a game, and even though I lost easily, the memory & lesson was well worth it so I'd like to share it.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Spanish game (Ruy Lopez)} a6 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 Na5 {5. Na5 was a new move for me at the time that is meant to remove White's bishop off the threatning f7 diagonal.} 6. O-O Nxb3 7. axb3 d6 8. d4 exd4 9. Nxd4 Qd7 {9...Qd7 to prevent the knight from sitting on c6} 10. Nc3 Bb7 11. Nd5 Bxd5 {11...Bxd5? is poor because it opens up the e file for attack against the uncastled king and sets up a key positional advantage.} 12. exd5 h6 {Overly concerned about white's bishop to g5, 12.h6 neglects development.} 13. Re1+ Be7 14. Nc6 {The key positional advantage being the advanced support square for the knight (a concept that I learned, not form a book, but as a direct result of this nasty game.)} a5 {Black offers a5 in vain hopes of removing the knight away from its ideal home on c6.} 15. Qe2 b4 16. Be3 Qf5 17. Bd4 Qg5 18. h4 Qxh4 19. Bxg7 Rh7 20. Bd4 f6 21. g3 Rg7 22. Nxe7 Rxg3+ {Desperate Black sacrafices in hopes of creating a lasting counter-attack.} 23. fxg3 Qxd4+ 24. Kh2 Qe5 {But it quickly runs out of steam and Black runs out of luck.} 25. Qf3 Qxb2 26. Nxg8+ Kd8 27. Qxf6+ Qxf6 28. Nxf6 Kc8 29. Re8+ {Knowing that being a rook & knight up, esp. vs. a GM, that there isn't much hope and Black resigns.}
