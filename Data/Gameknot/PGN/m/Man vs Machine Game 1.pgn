[Opening "Two knights defence (Modern bishop's opening) (C55)"]

1. e4 {What can I say? If you know me don't bother reading the rest of my rmablings on superiority of this move over all others because you will already know what I"m goiing to say. But for those of you who don't know me, here goes:  This is considered the main opening for the majority of GMs as White stakes out his claim to the centre. This is my normal opening, I decided not to change this as it is my fave and I'm not gonna try and do anything to drastic to bamboozle the computer until I've seen how good it is.   I don't like boring openings which in my opinion is almost everything apart from 1.e4. After 1.e4 there are loads of fun and wild gambits! Other pawn pushes with no real drawbacks include 1. d4 and 1. c4. And for our hypermodern players, there is always 1. Nf3, controlling the center with pieces and not commiting to a set pawn structure.  Flamin' boring though!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!} e5 {This is so White can't create a huge pawn centre unnopposed.} 2. Nf3 {Developing a knight to its best square, attacking the pawn, controlling two center squares.} Nc6 {The best move to defend. Also attacks two squares and develops a piece. I was interested to see what Jester's opening book was like so I decided to go into  something mainline. } 3. Bc4 {The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?(This is a very nice gambit which I have a few annotated games of "Naval Intelligence" a very nice little game!.) } Nf6 {This is the two knights defence. A very pro active defence against the Italian game. Computers are normally very good at tactics so I think I'll tryb and mobve the game into a less sharp game and a nmore strategical /positional one. My choices that I didn't use were 4.d4!? 4.0-0!? or 4.Ng5!? I ofcourse wanted to play strategically. So I choose a boring option.} 4. d3 {This is much more quiet than the previously mentioned moves. It opens a } Be7 5. O-O {Standard getting my king into a safe position.} O-O {Same.} 6. c3 {This move is a a preparation for a quick d4 creating a two-pawn abreast centre. jester needs to be very accurate in hid response or I will seize the intiative by the short and curlies. One of the downsides of this move is that it takes away the white knights most natural developing square c3. his mean sthe d4 push will have to be pre-empted by a move to defend the e4 pawn.} d6 {This solidifies the centre and opens up a diagonal for the light squared bishop. So far i can't see anything wrong with Jesters opening moves they're solid and logical. Not surprising from a computer.} 7. Bb3 {This move may seem a bit backwards, moving a piece in the opening twice is considered a cardinal sin however my plan was to bring it back to c2 to defend the e pawn after I have played d4. I'm not too concerned about the development issue I've got on my hands because Blacks position seems fairly passive at the moment and non-threatening for now.} Bg4 {A logical move: it develops a bishop and pins the knight.} 8. Nbd2 {This develops a piece and defends the knight.} Qd7 {Logical, it develops the queen and connects the rook. I can't see much of anm attack building up. Maybe I can gather my forces and Jester may eep making passive/non aggressive moves.} 9. Nc4 {This is a maneuvering move whereby I intend to move the knight to e3 attacking the g4 bishopand also preparing to go to d5 from there possibly.} Be6 {This seems a wasted move in my book. It doesn't do anything apart from un-pinning my knight wich I was quite happy about. I would suggest 9...Bh5 here as it holds the pin and dissapates the effect of my impending Ne3.} 10. Ng5 {I decided here that it was time for action. This responds blacks passive move with an attackling one. Now black will have to make a decision: Exchange on c4 or allow me to capture his bishop on e6.} Bxc4 {He chooses to exchange. I think better would have been 10...d5 counter-acting my attack on the wing with an attack in the centre, after 11.Ne3 Rad8 12.Nxe6 fxe6  and things are more or less equal.} 11. Bxc4 {If we analyse my position now we can see that I am about to play d4, and I have a more active position. jester has a defensive maybe even passive position.} Na5 {I think this move is not bad.; it attemts to take the bishop pair away from me, a good idea!} 12. Bb3 {So i can recapture with the queen.  "ionadowman (2036) on 02-Jan-08: ...Though I'd be inclined to recapture with the a-pawn: a possibly useful half-open file for the rook, pawns "doubled towards the centre". My own view of such an exchange is that it is slightly favourable for White."} h6 {Driving my knight away from it's attacking post.} 13. Nf3 Kh8 {This seems pointless to me, the only idea that comes to mind is that jester may be trying to move his rook to the g-file but that would weaken the f7-pawn. I recommend 13.Nxb3 immediatly as white can move his bishop, flawing the plan of jester to exchange one of my bishop pair.} 14. Ba4 {? I do the innevitable I save my bishop from impendiing death but the wrong way. I should have played 14.Bc2. This wastes time as I'm forced to play this move anmyway in the next move.} b5 {This is a good move defending the queen and forcing my bishop to retreat.} 15. Bc2 {I have to retreat...} c5 {It is a bit more obvious no why I shouldn't of played 14.Ba4 because it gives Jester momentum in building a queenside attack while I lose momentum by being forced to retreat. This move calmps the d4 square but it does creat a backward pawn on d6 a chink in the armour of  Jester's pawn structure. } 16. Be3 {I finally develop my last piece bulstering my forces effecting d4.} Nc6 {Black does likewise bringing his knight back out from the wing where it is not doing much to where it can affect my control of the d4 square. In this position i think I have the edge because I hve the bishop pair I have much better pawn structure with no weaknesses, I also have an offensive plan. Jester on the other hand has a weakened pawn structure with chinks on d6 and h6, he's in a very passive position overprotecting d4 and has no realistic attacking plans, apart from maybe putting a rook on g8 and pawnstorming the kingside. As I have most of the initiative it seems unlikely that black will get the chance to carry these out.} 17. Nh4 {This is another maneuvering move which is a pivot post where the knight can pivot to f5 forking blacks bishop and d6 backward pawn.  "This move does have a tactical drawback, though: 17...Nxe4."} Ng4 {This attacks my bishop pair and has a discovered attack on my h5 knight. Better is 17...d5 I think because it strikes out in the centre.} 18. Nf5 {! I see no problem in losing that bishop for his knight. My knight is now set on f5 an attacking outpost within the enemies border. This is powerful because it attacks g7 which is an infamour mating square,} Nxe3 19. fxe3 Bg5 {This attempts to ubndermine my centre by attacking my weak backward e3 pawn but...} 20. Qf3 {! The threat can be easily defended against. i give this move a ! because it defends a pawn while also moving an attacking piece to the kingside. One thing that i should perhaps point out is that backward pawns are weak because they have to be protected by pieces. Pieces shouldn't serve pawns. My backward e3 pawn is better than blacks because mine can support a d4 push has half-opened the f file and is easily defended and is difficult to be attacked. On the other hanmd blacks d6 pawn is now very weak because it is being defended by a queen which is much mor valuable than a mere pawn and this pins the queen to that pawn in a way because she has to defend it from my night on the powerful f5 squate. } Ne7 {Jester obviously realises the need to unpin his queen from protecting that backward pawn and attem,pts to trade my powerful f5 knight. a good plan. } 21. h4 {!! I can't retreat the knight so I decide to exchange on my terms. i think this move deserves !! because it counter attacks, ie athreat with a threat.} Nxf5 {??  This move is very poor for black it ends blacks chances....you will see from the ensueing exchanges 21...Bf6 would have kept Jester in the game.} 22. hxg5 Ne7 23. gxh6 Qe6 24. hxg7+ Kxg7 25. Rf2 {Now I'm up a pawn and am in a clear winning position. This rook move opens the f1 square for me to create an omnipotent batter on the half-open f-file of a queen and two rooks.} Rfh8 {This may plan to bring his king to safety via f8 and e8. Jester is thinking something entirely different though.} 26. Raf1 {This is the all powerful battery I was talking about...} Rh1+ {?? Madness giving up a rook for nothing. Why not retreat the king like I sugessted earlier?} 27. Kxh1 Rf8 28. Bb3 {Attacking the queen.} Qh6+ 29. Qh3 {When youb are ahead in material by say more than 3 points then exchange into a winning endgame if you can and/or destroying the enemy kings defenders.  "ionadowman (2036) on 02-Jan-08: Good plan. But it would be tempting just to play 29.Kg1, too. If Black tries 29...Rh8 (threatening mate) then 30.Qxf7#. But he also has this attractive possibility: 29...a5 (a "non-move" just to illustrate the idea) 30.Qxf7ch Rxf7 31.Rxf7ch Kh8 32.Rf8ch Kg7 33.R1f7ch Kg6 34.Rf6ch K-any 35.Rxh6 wins a rook and picks up the backward d-pawn into the bargain. If at move 32 Black interposes the knight, then 32...Ng8 33.Rxg8ch Kh7 34.Rf7ch Kxg8 35.Rf6ch Kg7 36.Rxh6 Kxh6 and his extra bishop and one-and-a-half pawns give White a winning game."} Qxh3+ {Jester's game is lost but he could atleast try and complicate the game a little instead of simplifying.} 30. gxh3 {I don't annotated the rest of the game as the rest of the game is fairly pointless. I checkmate Jester in 12 moves.. This game illustrates the positive ways in which moving pieces (in this games case knights) to maneuvering squares on a journey to a good square is eg. my Nd2 to c4 and if it hadn't been exchanged later e3. And when i played Nf6 to to Nh4 to Nf5. The sqaures that it lands on in between it's target destinations are normally not very strong  squares, these are the maneuvering or pivot points but the places they move to are normally quite effective outposts eg Nf5. Make sure thjough that the piece you are maneuvering doesn't get stuck on the passive pivot square where it can't affect the game.   I think this game was fairly equal until  Jester blundered with 21...Nxf5?? From there Jester's play went downhill.   My first impression is that Jester is not very good at  playing possitional chess, it tends to play passive  chess. and when it is on the backfoot it doesn't defend well. It does however play well when attacking as it is very good at calculations and tactical combos. Although that isn't clear in this game, if you play a blitz with jester yourself this will become clear. I'll annotate my next game with Jester "The strongest pure java chess program" on ://www.ludochess.com/ here on GK. The battle of Man vs Machine has begun it's 1-0 to Man!  I hope you enjoyed this game as much as I did playing it. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments.
