1. e4 {This was my first game at the Millfield International Tournament 2009. I won without too much difficulty, and I'm only annotating it for sake of completeness, having decided to annotate all my games from the tournament (at which I was disapointed to score  2 wins, 2 draws and 3 losses, the first time I had scored less than 50% points in a chess tournament of two or more rounds).} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 {The Vienna Gambit. This has ideas in common with the King's Gambit, but it is more solid. The standard response is 3...d5, but white has a good line against this in 4.d3, with a solid position.} Bd6 {This loses by force, as demonstrated here.} 4. fxe5 Bxe5 5. d4 Bxd4 {If 5...Bd6, 6.e5 forks black's peices. } 6. Qxd4 O-O 7. Bg5 Nc6 8. Qf2 {I judged this to be the best square to retreat to, on the grounds that it maintains the tension.} h6 9. Bxf6 gxf6 {Personally I consider this a mistake. While the king's defenses are opened after 9...Qxf6 10.Qxf6 gxf6 anyway, in that position it is far less dangerous since the queens are off. This gives an open route to the black king and blocks the queen off from defense.} 10. O-O-O {Preparing a rook lift.} d6 11. Rd3 Re8 12. Qh4 {Ideally, I wanted to play 13.Qxh6, but I doubted this would be possible. Best for black is 12...Kh7, when the c8 bishop prevents Rh3.} Ne5 13. Rg3+ Ng6 14. Bc4 {Pinning the f7 pawn, and thus making the g6 Knight en prise.} Kf8 {This loses the knight; the best black can go for is 14...Kh7, when the attack is beaten off for a time.} 15. Qxh6+ {Now, if 15...Ke7, then 16.Rxg6! wins the knight, since 16...fxg6?? 17.Qg7#. However, black does not even get away with this.} Kg8 16. Rxg6# {}
