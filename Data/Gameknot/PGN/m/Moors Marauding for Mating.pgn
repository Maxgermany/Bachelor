1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Another game in my Ruy Lopez tournament, another strong player matchup.  Krewals' rating was still provisional when I played him but it has since gelled in the strong mid-1800s range.  I didn't doubt it, looking over the sharp sorties he'd thrust and parried thus far, or was still fencing. } a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O {The most common moves thus far.  I wasn't using a database, however, just an ancient copy of I. A. Horowitz's Chess Openings: Theory and Practice, a free account on www.chessgames.com with limited resources, and my own chess sense.  The point of this tournament was to familiarize myself a little more with the Spanish Opening.} b5 {I've found that this early ...b5 maneuver (usually wedded with ...Bc5) is far more common, at least in my patchy experience on the white side of the Ruy, then the mainline Ruy 5. ...Be7 or 5. ...Nxe5, the two theoretically stamped continuations.} 6. Bb3 Bc5 {A sort of Ruy Lopez Classical Deferred.  I think the ...Bc5 maneuver appeals more to sub-master players because it's more active on the g1-a7 diagonal vis-a-vis the e7 post.  This treatment by the second player always seemed to me a distinctly old-fashioned treatment of the Ruy, even a little arrogant.} 7. Nxe5 {So, taking advantage of the "Fork Trick" more often found in Open games, I try to refute it outright.  A bit of hubris, but Nosferatu used to lead legions that slew entire villages of Turks and lived in Orientalist splendor in old Hungary before living in his ruinous cave, so I'm prone to old habits.  I learned later this is regarded only as a sideline to the more "correct" 7. a4 and 7. c3.} Nxe5 8. d4 Bxd4 9. Qxd4 Qe7 {I learned later from my pet rodent made from steel and alkaline blood that this was the last "book move," and 9. ...d6 and 9. ...Nc6 are preferred.  I saw nothing wrong with this move; it covers e5 and prepares a ...c5 advance that can snare my bishop if I'm asleep.} 10. Bf4 {I also considered the space-gaining 10. f4, though I didn't quite trust it, fearing overextension of my center and collapse since my queenside pieces are resting on their laurels.  There's no reason not to, however.  10. f4 is quite sound, and the most testing gaining central space, but I think Nosferatu was still leaping at turkish phantoms in my mind.} d6 {White's opening plan has pretty much been a wash, which I suppose is why 7. Nxe5 is regarded as too optimistic.  Black has now equalized.} 11. Bd5 {Anticipating ...c5.  Shepherding this bishop is proving to be a nuisance at any rate, and I was happy to exchange it.} c5 12. Qe3 Nxd5 {If 12. ...Rb8 I probably would have played 13. Nd2, with the idea of Rad1, b3, and c4.} 13. exd5 Bf5 14. a4 {Taking the tempo to attacking black's advanced queenside pawns, since his king is still in the center.} O-O 15. axb5 axb5 16. Na3 {Developing my last piece and eying b5, and well as a c4 support point if black plays ...b4, since black's knight is pinned against his queen for the time being.} f6 17. Bxe5 {My main alternative was 17. c4 b4 18. Nb5, but I didn't quite like my knight being stuck there, having no other square safe square to leap to and easy to pressure with moves like ...Bd7 and ...Rfb8.  I also didn't like 17. Nxb5 Bxc7 because I thought my b-pawn would also end up as a target.  I chose the text (besides the above considerations) because I didn't see my DSB doing very much, especially after black shored up things with 16. ...f6.} fxe5 18. f4 {Trying to generate some play against the same pinned e5 square.} b4 19. Nc4 e4 {Black does get a passed pawn through this move sequence, but I figured I had to live with it to unbalance the position a wee bit.  On the upside, it does stunt the enemy bishop's range along the b1-h7 diagonal and could potentially be a target for me to focus on. I do posees an f-pawn while black doesn't, if I get a chance to advance it in the future.} 20. c3 bxc3 21. bxc3 Rfb8 {Black grabs the other open file while we stand off on the a-file, neither one of us wishing to capitulate it.} 22. Na5 {Heading to what I hope will be a nice spot for the knight to nest, on c6.} Qe8 23. Nc6 Rxa1 {Black swaps off one seige engine, in order to free up its brother to infiltrate my second rank.} 24. Rxa1 Rb2 {Of course, my own parallel path with Ra1-a7 is now open to nag the enemy king with similar pressures.} 25. h3 {But first; time out for luft.} h5 {Black creates his own, high-ceiling version, with ideas of a further ...h4 push to contest my weak dark-squares.} 26. Ra7 {The white rook working in tandem with the knight behind the scenes can harass black a little more effectively than black's rook with the bishop.  Black needs to continually monitor the e7 square.} Bd7 {So black cuts off my rook's access.} 27. f5 {! However, the f-pawn is now allowed to spring to life and give my queen a route to the black kingside, with ideas of my own mating threats.} Rb1+ 28. Kf2 {?! I was about to move 28. Kh2, but then to my horror I found a way for black to win my queen: 28. Kh2 Bxc6 29. dxc6 Qe5ch 30. Qg3 Rh1ch 31. Kxh8 Qxg3.  Here I stopped analyzing, but the joke is on black (or perhaps Nosferatu who missed it) after all, since after 32. c7 (remember this brave infantryman?) I can simply promote a queen, as there is no move black can make to cover the c8 square.  Not seeing this I figured 28. Kf2 was forced.  After 28. Kh2 black has many more ways to go wrong than white.} h4 {Covering any other hatch-escape by the white king via g3.} 29. Qg5 {Now the black bishop is pinned by the mate threat on g7, and I have f6 in the works.} e3+ {! I saw that after 30. Qxe3?? Rf1ch wins for the second player.  Nothing to do but continue to draw my king out into the center as a blockade.  Luckily, his other pieces, the bishop & queen, are too awkwardly placed to take advantage of this.} 30. Ke2 Rb2+ 31. Ke1 {Black's e-pawn is protected by the queen as well as passed, so moving to f1 or d1 and facing ...e2ch is out of the question.} Kf8 32. f6 {Threatening mate, and the black queen cannot leave the back-rank due to Ra8ch, so:} Rb1+ {Black resorts to his perpetual.  The King's only squares are literally e1 and e2.  Trying to escape via f3 or d3 leads to mate, the former immediately on f2, the later through a long forcing sequence using the queen & rook.  I didn't analyze to mate but knew intuitively it'd lead to it, or at least catastrophic material loss, so a draw was agreed.  A nice positional bout of parry and thrust with the main gauche and rapier.}
