1. e4 {Into this game I get into some trouble. I was truly lucky to win this. I joined this site yesterday and have a perfect score. This one almost took that perfect score from me.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Be7 7. Re1 d6 8. c3 Bg4 9. d3 h6 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Nf1 Nd7 {slight mistake.} 12. Bd5 Ndb8 13. Ne3 Be6 14. d4 Bxd5 15. exd5 {Perhaps Nxd5 was better.} exd4 16. Nxd4 Nxd4 17. Qxd4 {So here material is even. My d pawn is slightly weak because at the moment I cant defend it with c4 cause he'll just take it. I have more space. I tried to attack and let's see how that goes.} Nd7 18. Nf5 Bf6 19. Qg4 {Shifting my pieces over for the assault.} Kh7 20. Qh5 Bg5 {! good move. I foolishly dismissed the possibility of this move when playing. Now my position is in danger as he is now threatening g6.} 21. Re7 {!? I dont really know if this is good. It creates complications for sure.} g6 22. Qh3 {!} Bxc1 23. Rxc1 h5 {If gxf5 Qxf5 blowing up his position.} 24. Re3 Qg5 25. Nxd6 {? What a sad move. So tactically inaccurate it's almost hard to believe I played it. If you want to see how to take advantage of it watch my opponent play. I should have played the safe ng3.} Nf6 26. f4 {? I dont know if there was anything to be done.} Qxd5 {Qxf5 works as well.} 27. Rd3 Qc5+ 28. Kh1 cxd6 29. b4 Qb6 30. Rd4 Ng4 31. Rf1 Rae8 32. f5 Re1 {! One blow after another. I was sure when he made this excellent move I was lost. Rxe1 nf2+.} 33. Qf3 Rxf1+ 34. Qxf1 Kg7 35. Qf4 {What can I do.} Ne5 {?! This is a mistake because it freely gives me f6 to play with. It should not lose the game, but unfortunately my pawn being a f6 eventually becomes the my lucky win.} 36. f6+ Kh7 37. Qg5 Rh8 38. h3 Kg8 39. Qf4 {Just shuffling around.} Qc7 40. Qe3 Kh7 41. Rh4 Rc8 {The rook which was passive now becomes dangerously active.} 42. c4 {!} bxc4 {He should have played Qd8 for defense to come to f8.} 43. Qg5 {It is hard to say. } c3 {This game is now won for me. He could have played 43...Qe8 49. Rxh5+ hxg5 (49...Kg8 50. Rh8+ Kxh8 51. Qh6+ Kg8 52.Qg7#) 50. Qxh5+ Kg8 51. Qh6 Qf8 and I lose.} 44. Rxh5+ {He resigned as now there is no defense to the coming mate.}
