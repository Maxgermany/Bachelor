1. e4 {This game was played when I was rated 1486, and panditanuj was rated 1626. The game was for panditanuj's mini-tournament, and shows how after a strange oppening, White was able to get ahead and win.} e5 2. Nf3 d5 {So he tries The Center Counter, but after playing 1...e5 first. I thought it was a bit peculiar, but it was a pretty good opening.} 3. exd5 e4 4. Qe2 {Now the pawn is pinned to the king, and can't take the Knight.} Nf6 {I think 4...Qxd5 would have been stronger.} 5. d3 {5. Nc3 would have easily won this, however, I missed it.} Qxd5 6. Nc3 Bb4 {He pins the Knight to my King, which was a great move on his part.} 7. dxe4 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 Qxe4 {This forces a Queen trade, and is much better than 8...Nxe4? because of 9. Nd2! f5 10. f3! Winning the Knight.} 9. Qxe4+ Nxe4 10. Bd3 Nf6 11. O-O O-O 12. Re1 Nc6 13. Bf4 {A poor move on my part.} Nd5 14. Bd2 Bd7 15. Rab1 b6 16. Nd4 Rfe8 17. Be4 {I don't want to trade Rooks just yet.} Nde7 {A small mishap. This lets me get an advantage, allowing me to later win his a-pawn.} 18. Bg5 f6 19. Bf4 {I make him play 18. f6 to limit future squares for his Knights.} Rac8 20. Nb5 Ne5 21. Nxa7 Rcb8 22. Bxe5 fxe5 {A get a pawn, but he gets a pawn into the center, so he has some compensation. It is an isolated pawn on an open file though, and will easily fall.} 23. Nb5 c6 {? this gets me hs e pawn.} 24. Nd6 Ref8 25. Nc4 {Forks his two pawns.} Be6 26. Nxe5 Bxa2 27. Rb2 Be6 {27...Bd5?? fails to 28.Bxd5 Nxd5 29. Nd7! forking the Rooks.} 28. Bxc6 Rfd8 29. f4 Rbc8 30. Rxb6 Rd6 {A great move! At first I thought he had me there, that I'd made the fatal mistake, but then I saw it!} 31. c4 {!! The only move that I could have done.  I almost looked over it, but I'm glad I saw it.} Nxc6 32. c5 {!! This was the whole point of 31. c4} Rd2 33. Nxc6 Re8 34. f5 Bd7 35. Rxe8+ Bxe8 {As you can see, White has this game won, the rest of the game is just technique.} 36. Nb4 {Defends the pawn, and threatens c6.} Ba4 37. Rb8+ Kf7 38. c6 Bxc2 39. Rb7+ Kf6 40. Rd7 Re2 41. Nd5+ {!! this move wins the game.} Kxf5 42. c7 Be4 43. c8=Q {I get a pawn Queened, so there is nothing he can do to stop me.} Rxg2+ 44. Kf1 Rxh2 45. Re7+ Kg5 46. Re5+ Kh6 47. Qc1+ {! This gets it done quick and easy.} Kg6 48. Qc6+ Kf7 49. Qe8# {panditanuj put up a good fight, but his lose of pawns was too great of a mistake.}
