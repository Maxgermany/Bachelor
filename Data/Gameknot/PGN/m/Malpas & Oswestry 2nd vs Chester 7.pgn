[Opening "Sicilian (B94), Najdorf, 6.Bg5"]

1. e4 {This is fascinating. Black played the thematic exchange sacrifice on c3. The question is - was the exchange sound, or could white have refuted it?} c5 {It starts as a Sicilian Defence.} 2. Nf3 {White plays the open variation. } d6 {All this has been played many times before.} 3. d4 {This is the open variation.} cxd4 {Black takes.} 4. Nxd4 {White takes back.} Nf6 {Black attacks e4} 5. Nc3 {White defends. } a6 {Najdorf Variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Najdorf_Variation} 6. Bg5 {This is the main line. Also common are 1. English Attack: 6.Be3 2. Fischerâ€“Sozin Attack: 6.Bc4 3.	Classical/Opocensky Variation: 6.Be2 4.	Amsterdam Variation: 6.f4 5.	The Adams Attack: 6.h3} h6 {6.....h6 is highly unusual. 6....e6, is by far the most common move and 6.....Nbd7 and 6.....Nc6 are played.} 7. Bh4 {White's first mistake. White places too much faith in his bishop. He should take the chance to  double black's pawns.} Nc6 8. Bc4 {White choses an agressive square for his bishop.} e6 {Black blunts the bishop and we transpose back into normal positions.} 9. Bb3 {The bishop drops back. 0-0 is normally played in this position, but that is coming soon.} Be7 {Black develops.} 10. Bg3 {This bishop drops back too. I am not sure of the white plan.} O-O {Black castles.} 11. O-O {So does white, but I would have been tempted to move the queen and play 0-0-0.} Na5 {A fairly thematic Sicilian move.} 12. Kh1 {This move is often played too.} Bd7 {Black continues to develop.} 13. f4 {This is thematic.} Rc8 {Normal development.} 14. Qf3 {Fritz prefers 14. e5} Nc4 {Another thematic move, although Fritz prefers Qb6 and surprisingly g6.} 15. Bxc4 {White takes.} Rxc4 {Rook takes back.} 16. Rad1 {White develops. Fritz agrees this is best.} Qb6 {Attacking d4 and b2. Fritz agrees this is best.} 17. Nb3 {Knight drops back. Fritz agrees this is best.} Rxc3 {So here it is, the bold exchange sacrifice. It is not what Fritz would play. I wouldn't play it either. I have played this sort of sacrifice, but I would want at least a pawn in return. Having said that it is pretty thematic and white has no open files for his rooks.} 18. bxc3 {White correctly takes back this way, in order to keep his e pawn. Fritz now gives the position as equal, but before the exchange sacrifice it was given as advantage to black.} Bc6 {Attacking e4. Fritz agrees this is best.} 19. Rfe1 {White protects e4. Fritz agrees this is best.} Rc8 {The logical square for this rook, but Fritz prefers d5.} 20. Nd4 {White centralises his knight. Fritz agrees this is best.} Ba4 {Fritz prefers Nxe4 21.	Rxe4	Bxe4 22.	Qxe4	Rxc3. Black attacks c2, although at the moment it is protected by Nd4.} 21. f5 {Threatening to exchange on e6 and then play Nxe6. Fritz pefers Rb1 or Bh4.} e5 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} 22. Nb3 {Fritz agrees that this is best, in fact it is the only move to save the knight and the pawn on c2.} Bc6 {Black renews his attacks on e4. Seems likea good idea to me. Fritz prefers Ne8 or Nd7. Not sure why.} 23. Bf2 {White attacks the black queen.} Qc7 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} 24. h4 {White decides to attack on the kingside. Fritz prefers c4 or Nd2.} h5 {Fritz doesn't like this move either, preferring Bb5 or b5.} 25. c4 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} b6 {To me this is a logical move, but Fritz prefers Ng4 or b5.} 26. Nd2 {A defensive move.} Ng4 {Fritz now gives this as the second best move, preferring b5.} 27. Bg1 {White continues to put great faith in his bishop. Fritz likes Re2.} Bxh4 {This is why moving the bishop was wrong. Black now has the advantage.} 28. Ref1 {Better Re2 staying protecting e4.} Qd8 {Fritz prefers Bg5 or Bd8.} 29. Qh3 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} b5 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} 30. c5 {Fritz agrees that this is best. Now that the doubled pawn is going to be exchanged, Fritz says it is equal again.} d5 {Black avoids undoubling the white pawns, but Fritz doesn't like this move.} 31. Nf3 {Fritz gives just taking on d5 as best, but this as the second best move. It thinks white is better now.} Bf6 {The bishop was attacked.  Fritz actually likes the piece sacrifice here - 31.... d4 32. Nxh4 Bxe4 with attacks on pawns on c5 and c2.} 32. Qxh5 {Fritz puts white 1.56 up now.} Nh6 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} 33. g4 {Threatening pawn fork. Fritz prefers exd5.} d4 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} 34. g5 {This looks good as it forks bishop and knight. Fritz doesn't like this move.} Nxf5 {Steve gives himself an exclamation mark for this move,but Fritz thinks the best move is Bxg5 and 2nd best is Bxe4.} 35. exf5 {The natural capture, but Fritz prefers Qg4 as best, followed by Kh2.} Bxg5 {Of course the bishop is safe as Nf3 is pinned. Fritz agrees that this is best.} 36. Bh2 {Steve gives this move 36.Bh2?! but I'd be tempted just to give it a question mark. Fritz gives 36. Kh2 as best, followed by Bf2.} f6 {Steve correctly gives himself an exclamation mark, and quite rightly! Fritz agrees it is the best move.} 37. Kg2 {Fritz doesn't like this move either.} Qd5 {Fritz agrees it is the best move. The pendulum has swung in black's favour now.} 38. Kf2 {White's king seems to be on a suicide mission into the centre and to his doom. Fritz prefers 38. Kh3.} Be3+ {Fritz agrees it is the best move, and gives it as  +1.66 for black.} 39. Ke1 {White continues with his plan of walking into trouble! The king should have gone back to the g file.} Qxc5 {Fritz agrees it is the best move. +2.56 now.} 40. Rd3 {Bf1 trying to exchange a powerful attacking piece was better.} Qb4+ {Even better were the simple moves e4 or Qxc2.} 41. Ke2 {It is becoming a bit academic now, but both Nd2 and c3 were better.} e4 {Simple and strong, but Be4 or Be8 were even better.} 42. Rxe3 {White takes.} dxe3 {Black takes back.} 43. Kxe3 {White takes.} exf3 {The knight goes. Fritz agrees it is the best move. Fritz says it is mate in 15.} 44. Rd1 {White tries to take control of the d file.} Qe4+ {Fritz agrees it is the best move. It is mate in 11.} 45. Kd2 {Fritz prefers Kf2.} Qd4+ {And now, the end is near And so I face the final curtain} 46. Ke1 {Kc1 holds out slightly longer.} Qe3+ {Many thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it. Please leave a comment or two and mark it with the star system, to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader, and I'll leave the last words to Steve. "0-1 White Resigned. It's mate!!!!!!!!!! well very soon lol!!!!!!!!"}
