1. Nf3 {This game is my first annotated game. I picked this one in particular for my rook sacrifice at the end, which I really like but don't actually know if it is good or not. Overall not one of my better games, having difficulty handling an opponent 100 points below me. My tactical skills in the middlegame especially are lacking.} d5 2. d4 Bg4 {I take it out of the opening book because I play 1.c4 as white and 1... Nf6 vs 1.d4 so I don't know this opening very well.} 3. Ne5 Bf5 4. c4 f6 5. Nf3 e6 6. Nc3 Bb4 7. Qb3 {Tricky. I must be aware of b7 if I move my bishop.} Nc6 8. a3 Bxc3+ {The check buys me the time I need to take care of the threat at b7} 9. Qxc3 Nge7 10. Bf4 O-O 11. e3 Qd7 12. Be2 Ng6 13. Bg3 Rae8 {Looking back perhaps dxc4 would have been better.} 14. O-O Kh8 {I plan to open up the diagonal and don't want my king there.} 15. b4 {This move scared me. I don't know why.} dxc4 16. Bxc4 a6 17. b5 axb5 18. Bxb5 e5 19. Rad1 Qe6 {a super dumb move which at the time was not exploited.  Continuation: 20.d5 Qf7 21.dxc6 b6 22.Bc4 Qe7 etc probably should have done Qd5.} 20. Bc4 {good thing I moved my king/he didn't notice d5} Qe7 21. d5 {ahh now he does it. a little late. } e4 {mistakes flying hard and fast. This left open 22.d6 which thankfully he did not see. Saving the knight seems annoying though. I don't know what would have been better.} 22. Ne1 Nce5 23. Bb5 Bd7 24. Be2 c6 25. d6 {I saw the push but felt that it was ineffective and could be take care of. the pawn on d6 has not enough support to survive.} Qe6 26. Nc2 Red8 27. Rd4 {This was a nice move. I don't know if the moves afterward were what David planned but it's sneaky regardless.} f5 {perhaps a direct Nf7 would have been better. This move, while not bad in itself, leads to complications that could have been avoided.} 28. h4 {annoying. With no way to stop h5, I have to clear a space for the retreat.} Rfe8 {someone suggested c5. Tricky, but at my skill level I miss stuff like that all the time. 28...c5 29.Qxc5 Rc8 and I have compensation for my dropped knight. 28...c5 29.Rook move solves all my troubles.} 29. h5 Nf8 30. Rb4 {The problem with the knight's retreat, of course, it that it brings this double attack into play. No longer will I get the d6 pawn for free eventually.} Nf7 {The only way to retain the pawn? I thought so, and then I realized that Bc4 would own me. Good thing he didn't see it.  Sloppy play on my part. Giving up free knights. I need to pay attention. In my defense this was during the period of time where I was super busy with college applications and spent a maximum of a minute per game.} 31. Rxb7 Nxd6 32. Rbb1 {Perhaps a little initiative grab with Nd4 would have been better?} Nb5 33. Qb2 Re7 {The most obvious mistake, and the one that David finally exploits. For the rest of the game I'm down the exchange. } 34. Bh4 Ra8 35. Bxe7 Qxe7 36. Rba1 Ne6 37. Rfc1 Be8 38. Nb4 c5 39. Nd5 Qb7 {Perhaps putting her majesty into a pin was not the best choice, but neither could I do Qd7 due to Nb6.} 40. Nc3 {Ends the long-standing pin on my g-pawn. My question #1 for any reader... is Qe5 better for white? 40...Rd8 stops the fork from winning material, but wouldn't trading off be better for white? I feel as if my c-pawn would be easily captured after some trades occur. Anyone?} Rb8 {Nd6 perhaps would reduce amount of traded material. But it's alright, because David doesn't seem to want to trade. I don't know why.} 41. a4 {again, same thing: does Nxb5 followed by Qe5 confer some advantage?} Nxc3 {If Qxb7 then Nxe2+ Kf2 Rxb7 Kxe2 and I'm up. Handy to ensure the queens are kept on the board for me.} 42. Qxc3 h6 {I don't want a power struggle for g7 thank you very much.} 43. g4 {Now after my share of errors, I'm finally done with college applications and can think about the game more. As we transition into my best phase, the endgame, David starts to make errors. perhaps mistake #1 was opening up his king here. I still have over half my pieces.  } fxg4 44. Bxg4 Qd5 45. Bxe6 {Greedy. Qc4 is fine. This way I start to dominate.} Qxe6 46. Qxc5 Qg4+ 47. Kf1 Bxh5 48. Ra2 {Annoying. Covers his second rank. However this leaves his rooks unguarded and I can potentially use this to my advantage.} Rd8 {This or Qh4 both threaten the same thing: mate.} 49. f3 {Necessary. Not much else can deal with Qh3+. Perhaps f4 would have been better.} Qxf3+ {The incorrect choice, although it doesn't really matter. Qh3 is more secure and gets it done faster by getting my bishop on f3.} 50. Kg1 Rd5 {This is why I decided to annotate this game. I won't even post any analysis of this, as a) I didn't do enough, and b)I will leave it up to the reader.  Question #2: Is this sound?} 51. Qc8+ {He apparently decided it was sound. This is a shame, because he will now die quickly.} Kh7 52. Rcc2 {Rg2 at least saves him for a little bit.} Rd1+ {The kill is made.} 53. Kh2 Rh1# {}
