1. g3 {I was very pleased to see this win by my young player. Oli has only been playing league chess since September, and really struggled with his first few matches, often losing quickly, playing too fast. But he has slowed down, thinking more about his moves, and has now won three out of his six matches in this league} e5 {So Black sets up a pawn centre.} 2. Bg2 {Oli completes his fianchetto} d5 {Continuing in classical style, she sets up a good pawn centre.} 3. Nf3 {Oli develops and attack e5.} Nc6 {Black protects. Not a bad move, but I prefer e5-e4 attacking the Nf3.} 4. d3 {A good move, if now 4....e5-e4 white can exchange on e5 and then exchange queens - e4? 5.	dxe4	dxe4 6.	Qxd8+ and Kxd8? is strongly met by 7. Ng5! attacking f7 and e4 and white has a small edge according to the chess computer Fritz} Be6 {Sensible development by black.} 5. O-O {White castles} Nf6 {Another sensible developing move, but as black I would have played 5...f6 followed by....Qd7 and .....0-0-0} 6. Nc3 {More development by white. This move has been seen before, although usually this knight goes to d2 where it can't be attacked by d5-d4} Bd6 {Black continues with her development.} 7. Nb5 {Surprisingly, this logical move doesn't seem to be in my opening databases - 7. e4, 7. a3, 7. Bg5 and 7. Re1 have all been played before. I am not sure that any of them are better than 7. Nb5. Fritz actually likes Ng5 in this position - a similar idea to Oliver's move.} O-O {Black allows the exchange} 8. Nxd6 {So white correctly takes.} Qxd6 {And black correctly takes back with her queen.} 9. Bd2 {Logical development by white.} Ng4 {A bit of a strange move by black. Fritz prefers 9....h6} 10. Qe1 {I am not sure what white had in mind with this move. Maybe hoping advance e2-e4 - I am uncertain. Fritz prefers 10. h3 or 10. Ng5} e4 {Black gets in first, playing a pawn to e4 before white can.} 11. dxe4 {So white takes.} dxe4 {Black takes back.} 12. Bf4 {A clever move by white attacking the black queen} Qd7 {The queen drops back.} 13. Rd1 {White attacks the black queen again. There is an interesting queen sacrifice in this position - 13.....exf3 14.	Rxd7	fxg2 and black attacks both the rook on d7 and the rook on f1. White does best to continue with 15. Rxc7 gxf1=Q+ with queen and pawn against rook, knight and bishop, the position is evenly balanced. } Qe7 {But black avoids that} 14. Ng5 {Black is now attacking e4 twice, with knight and bishop.} Bf5 {This is logical, the e pawn is now protected twice, by bishop and queen. Fritz suggests the interesting move 14...e4-e3 here.} 15. f3 {Logical again, attacking the knight on g4. Fritz likes the moves 15. h3, 15. Qc3 and 15. Rd5 here.} Ne3 {Up to now neither side has made any serious mistakes and have played sensibly and the position is even. This move however is a blunder, just throwing away a knight.} 16. Bxe3 {Which white gratefully takes.} Nb4 {An interesting move, attacking pawns on a2 and c2.} 17. Qf2 {Which white parries with a threat of his own - 18. Bc5 is threatened, skewering the queen and the rook behind it and also attacking the Nb4} Rfd8 {Which black defends against.} 18. Nxh7 {And now it is white's turn to blunder, just giving away a knight exactly as black had done a few moves ago.} Bxh7 {And now it is black's turn to gratefully take a knight with a bishop.} 19. Bc5 {White reverts to his former plan, forking queen and knight.} e3 {This is a class move by black, and clearly the best move in this position. Black saves the knight by sacrificing a pawn.} 20. Bxe7 {So white takes.} exf2+ {Black takes back with check. OK, so do you recapture with king or rook?} 21. Kxf2 {Of course! If 21. Rxf2?? Rxd1!} Bxc2 {This is the third blunder of the game, just throwing away a rook. Maybe black was thinking, "If he takes my rook with his bishop, I can take his rook with my bishop. But even in that situation white can take the bishop with his rook and be a bishop up. But there is a better move for white.} 22. Rxd8+ {and that is this - black is a whole rook up now - as well as the extra pawn he has.} Rxd8 {So black takes the rook.} 23. Bxd8 {White takes back.} Nc6 {Black just throws away another pawn. Either 23....Nxa2 or 23....c7-c6 are better} 24. Bxc7 {Which white gratefully accepts.} Nb4 {By returning to b4 black is just wasting time. Having said that, her position is very hard anyway.} 25. Bd6 {White attacks the knight} Nxa2 {The knight takes the pawn.} 26. Ra1 {White attacks the knight. It has no save squares it can go to.} Bb3 {But luckily for black, there is one way she can defend it.} 27. Bc5 {White attacks a pawn.} b6 {Black attacks and defends!} 28. Bd6 {So now it is white's turn to waste a move.} a6 {Pawn advances.} 29. f4 {But this pawn advance frees the Bg2. White has a strong plan up his sleeve! } b5 {Black nudges forward a pawn again.} 30. Be4 {This is the second move of the plan. The bishop is coming round to b1 to attack the Nh2. It shouldn't actually win the knight because when gets to b1 the knight then has the c1 square, as the Bishop on b1 blocks the rook's control of c1. Unfortunately I can't make sense of the score-sheet after this point, but the game ended soon after this point, with white winning. White has a huge advantage in this position, being rook and pawn up.}
