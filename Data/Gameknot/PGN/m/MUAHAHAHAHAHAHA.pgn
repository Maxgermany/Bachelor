Be3 {..} Bxg3 {im usually very stingy and insecure about usin my g2 and f2 pawns...but i hav no such compunctions about wastin my h8 pawn. doesnt do much l8er anyway.} 15. hxg3 {..} b5 {..} 16. b4 {..} Nb6 {..} 17. a4 {..} bxa4 {..} 18. Nxa4 {..} Nc4 {..} 19. Nc5 {n i have this craze of repeatedly targeting the opposing queen..allows me a lot of useful movement later,.} Qb6 {..} 20. c3 {..} Nxe3 {i suppose its just commonsense not to waste the f2 n g2 pawns....at least until we have no other option. prevents a lot of nasty checks later on. movin the h pawn away earlier helps ur king to hav at least one space of diagonal movement in case the opponent tries to checkmate u from the other side with a rook or queen} 21.

Rca1 {..} d4 {..(no idea y he did this)} 26. cxd4 {..} f5 {i assumed that i had the better position at this point for a pawn promotion race, because my advancing pawns were NOT aimed at his kingside. so i decided to exchange out all the other pieces...like so-.} 27. b5 {..} axb5 {..} 28. Ra5xa8 {..} Rxa8 {..} 29. Rxa8+ {..} Qxa8 {and that one extra pawn that MIGHT prove dangerous l8er} 30. Qb3+ {..} Kf8 {..} 31. Qxb5 {..} Qa1+ {..} 32. Kh2 {..} Qxd4 {..} 33. Qb8+ {..} Kf7 {..} 34. c6 {..} Qf6 {if i had proceeded to move the pawn up at this point, his queen wud've started a chain of infinite checks from h6 and c1 and thus enforce a draw and preventing me from a tasty victory. so i decided to do sumthin else-} 35. Qc7+ {..} Qe7 {..} 36. Qc8 {..} Qe6 {hmm, now that blasted queen was aiming at the h6 spot AND my queen. } 37. Qb7+ {..} Ke8 {..} 38. Kg1 {i used this opportunity to get my king away from the h line. now the black queen can no longer check me in one move.} e3 {and now hes allowing me even more movement for my king in the future thanks to-} 39. c7 {-} exf2+ {-this pawn trade (though i really wonder about the possibilities of 39.e2)} 40. Kxf2 {..} Qa2+ {now she has no hope of doin an infinite chek string. i have plenty of room to move my king..} 41. Kf3 {..} Qa3+ {..} 42. Kf4 {..} Qc1+ {..} 43. Kxf5 {..} g6+ {..} 44. Ke6 {..} Qe3+ {..} 45. Kd6 {..} Qxg3+ {from here on my aim was just to get that king on the other side of my own queen to sheild him from any more checks.} 46. Kc5 {..} Qc3+ {..} 47. Kb5 {..} Qe5+ {..} 48. Kb6 {..} Qd6+ {victory is mine.....} 49. Ka7 {..} Qa3+ {..} 50. Kb8 {and screw the saying about counting your chickens before they hatch.} Qg3 {..} 51. Ka8 {..} Qa3+ {..} 52. Qa7 {..} Qc3 {..} 53. Qb8+ {..} Kd7 {..} 54. Qd8+ {finally. :-P  too bad tag royally whooped my ass in all our other matches.}
