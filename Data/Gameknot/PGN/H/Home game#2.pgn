[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence"]

1. e4 {I started game with King's pawn opening.} c5 {My friend replied with Sicilian defence.} 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 {Now the game is in Sicilian, Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence.} 4. Bc4 {The next move in Sicilian, Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence is Nxc3, but I wanted to sacrifice my second pawn for development (if he would take it).} cxb2 {He did, and his comment was: why you always let me eat your peaces there must be some trick.} 5. Bxb2 {I said you see the trick? Look at my development.} Qa5+ 6. Nc3 d6 7. Nf3 e6 8. O-O {Now my knight on c3 is unpinned.} Be7 9. Nb5 {Whit this move I attack pawn on d6 and clear the way for black bishop to attack pawn on g7.} Nf6 {He saw what I was trying to do.} 10. e5 {Maybe not the best move here.} dxe5 11. Nxe5 {Centralizing my knight, but he is to vulnerable.} O-O 12. Bc3 {A little bit of Queen chasing.} Qb6 13. Bd4 Bc5 14. Rb1 Bxd4 15. Nxd4 Qc5 {If I move my Knight here, my bishop is gone, probably the best move here is Re1.} 16. Rb5 {Here I protect my Knight and attack his Queen.} Qc7 {He is still pressuring my Bishop And my Knight on e5.} 17. Bb3 {?} a6 {I take time for my next move here. One of my peace will fall, but wich one? If I try to save my rook, then he must go on b4, but I didn't want him there. So what to do?} 18. Ng4 {?! If 18...Nxg4, 19. Qxg4 axb5, 20. Nxg5 and my position is not so good.} axb5 {But the rook was to tempting.} 19. Nxf6+ {So I started to clearing the defence around his King.} gxf6 20. Qg4+ Kh8 21. h4 e5 {I don't know why he didn't attack my Queen with Rg8. When I asked him (after the game), he said, that he did attack my Queen with Bishop, and when I would move my Queen, he would take my knight.} 22. Nf5 {But I didn't move her, and now I have a Mate thread on g7.} Bxf5 {I think better was 22.....Rg8.} 23. Qxf5 Nd7 {Protecting f6.} 24. h5 {Here I must play Bc2, and there is no way to prevent mate on h7, unless he loses his Queen. 24. Bc2 Qxc2, 25. Qxc2} Qd6 {?} 25. Rd1 {? Again 25. Bc2, and mate is unavoidable. 25. Bc2 e4, 26. Bxe4...., 27. Qxh7#} Qc6 {And here I saw, what I miss, but now I take another approach.} 26. Bd5 {Going to e4 square with my Bishop.} Qd6 27. Be4 {I don't need that rook} Qxd1+ 28. Kh2 {All moves from now on are delaying unavoidable mate.} Qxh5+ 29. Qxh5 f5 30. Qxf5 Nf6 31. Qxf6+ Kg8 32. Qg5+ {Not 32. Qf5, because 32.....Kg2 and there is an escape route via e file.} Kh8 33. Qf5 Rxa2 34. Qxh7# {Thanks for watching. Any comments are welcome. Have a nice day.}
