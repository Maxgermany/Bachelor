1. e4 {This is the second game between Graham and Myself.  This first one i lost.  I made a fatal mistake neglecting my King defense.} g6 {Preparing the fianchetto.} 2. d4 {Normal response.  I am happy to build a strong center.} Bg7 {There it is.  This is the same as our first game which I lost so i decided to change things.} 3. c3 Nh6 {Preparing to castle kingside.} 4. Bd3 O-O 5. Nf3 d6 {Preparing e4.} 6. O-O {Castle to Safety.} e5 7. Be3 {Need to protect my central pawns.} b6 {Preparing the develop his bishop.} 8. Qd2 {Looking to dislodge the knight and bishop protecting his king.} Ng4 {He saw it and decided the best defense is to attack. } 9. h3 Nxe3 10. Qxe3 {I have a stonger control over the center but his other bishop could cause problems.} exd4 11. Nxd4 Re8 12. Bb5 Bd7 13. Bc4 {Would like to avoid this exchange, } Nc6 14. Nxc6 Bxc6 {Now e4 is under big pressure} 15. Bd3 d5 16. f3 d4 {cannot capture as Bd4 would pin my queen.} 17. Qd2 Qh4 {Now I am in trouble.  I dont like his queen this close to my king.  I cannot push her away .} 18. Re1 {I need to protect the e File.  The attack is on and i cant afford any break in concentration or its all over..} Rad8 19. c4 {Cant allow his d pawn to move.  } Bh6 20. Qe2 Be3+ {Be carefull. :-)  I thought long and hard about this move.  I had to think about safety and also counter attack.  I cant afford to lose another one.} 21. Kh2 Bd7 22. Nd2 {I need protection for my g3 square.} Re5 23. Nf1 {Now removal of his bishop will give me more chances.} Rh5 {this is dangerous now.} 24. Nxe3 Qf4+ {Bxh3 would have been better for graham I think.} 25. Kg1 dxe3 26. Qxe3 Qg3 {He can now capture my h pawn without penalty.  He should have taken it already on move 24.} 27. Qf2 {When under so much pressure I think it best to sacrifice my pieces for his attacking pieces and relieve some pressure.} Qg5 {He must have had the same thoughts so he backed off the exchange.} 28. Kf1 {Wanted to avoid pinning my g pawn.} Bc6 {Threatens my e4 pawn and my Bishop on d3} 29. g4 {A slight mis-calculation on my part.  I was hoping to trap the rook.} Rxh3 30. Rad1 {Protection :-)} Rh1+ 31. Ke2 Rh3 {I would have been happy to sacrifice my rook.  Ease some tension.  Graham keeping it tight and keeping the pressure.} 32. Reh1 {I offer my own sacrifice.} Rxh1 33. Rxh1 Qe5 {Gowing queenside.} 34. Rb1 Rd4 {I wasn't realy sure what he was doing here except from maybe trying to put more pressure on the e4 square.  He would have been down on exchanges so this didn't really make much sense to me.  Maybe he had something up his sleeve.} 35. Rc1 Qd6 {Double up pressure on the bishop.} 36. Rd1 a6 37. b3 b5 38. c5 {Giving up a pawn to move the queen from the d file.} Qxc5 39. Bb1 {offer on the table.  double threat on the rook and he would come off second best.} Qc3 40. Qxd4 {Graham resigned.  This was a very tough game.  I was caught off guard early and was lucky enough to come out of this.  I would have been happy with a draw half way through but if you keep on fighting you may surprise yourself.  Graham won our third game :-)  Well done buddy,  2 : 1 to you.  ( so far ) :-)}
