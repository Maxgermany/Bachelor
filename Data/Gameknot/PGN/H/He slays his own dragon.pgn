1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 {So far this is standard Sicilian Dragon play.} Nxd4 {? This is a novelty in my database. Most usual is nf6.} 7. Bxd4 Bxd4 8. Qxd4 {Now I have the center with a tempo on his rook. } f6 9. Bc4 {Three pieces in the center. Black has none.} e6 10. O-O-O {The threat is Bxe6.} a6 {?} 11. Bxe6 Qe7 12. Nd5 {Why not bring another piece into the attack.} Qd6 {??} 13. Nxf6+ {He resigned understandably. My opponent is probably very good, however if you play a new opening make sure you know a lot about it. Not just moves, but plans and ideas. That way when you're opening memory runs out you know enough to still be working toward your goals. Also in correspondence you can use a database, which using will also help you in otb games. Thank you. And yes, I've lost one game which ended my 17 game win streak. And to be blunt I am not annotating it (for a while, maybe later), because it depresses me.}
