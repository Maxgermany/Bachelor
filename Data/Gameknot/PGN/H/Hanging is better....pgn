[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation (D00)"]

1. d4 {Interesting blitz. } d5 2. Bf4 c6 3. c3 {White has to play symmetrically because of Qb6. It's playable, but it leads to another kind of game. } h6 {Preparing a pawn storm against the bishop. } 4. Nf3 e6 {g5, Bg3, h5, h4!. White thinks already on a queenside castling. } 5. Nbd2 Nf6 6. h3 {Better was e3. White is preparing his own pawn storm. } Bd6 7. Ne5 {The key move in this line. The K in f6 prevents black from playing f6 at once. } O-O {Black should have gone Nh5, while he could. I'd answered Bh2. } 8. e3 {Let's say we transposed into this well-known position. } Qc7 {Preparing Nd7. } 9. g4 {Bd3 is not threatening. My bet on this opening is that white has to get the bishop out ONLY when it represents a real threat to black. I can see no difference in white's position after Bd3. I don't want to castle kinside. Even after Qc2, the check in h7 (alone) is not a threat, so there's no need to waste time, when other moves like the text can make the opponent stop and think?} c5 {! A good move. Still, black should have gone for the Nd7 way, slowing down white's attack. But the idea behind this move is to become active on the queenside - the right strategy for black, given the position. But this reflects c6 as a waste of time. Black will pay for it. } 10. Nb3 {This was a try. White can follow his original plan and just play h4, to g5, etc. The text move opens a tactic line if c4: Nc5. Then black has to calculate if he can safely take the c pawn with BxN, or kick the Knight with b6. I'm not sure at all that white will get advantage from any of those lines. So my move deserves a ?.  } cxd4 11. exd4 {? I thought: "not Nxd4 because of BxN. True is that then white can go Nb5, but I didn't see it during the game.  } Ne4 {As frightening as it is, this knight is scarcely a problem for white. And, note, black has it not easy playing...} 12. Qf3 {(This queen move is a key one, because it becomes active on black's kingside. Trust me. On the other side, protects c3 against a possible sac)} f6 {...because of...} 13. Ng6 {Nice. If black goes BxB, NxR, and white wins the exchange. } Rf7 {Wisely. But now, how to proceed? White has it not easy to continue the attack. The only attacking move is...} 14. Bd3 {Black can exchange pieces, but he will lose the d5 pawn once in e4. This is not so simple, you see: black can try e5, and white can't take it or the rook's action on the f column will become dangerous. Anyway, black - who was obviously putting all his hopes in the knight sac on c3, saw the chance to play it - since the white queen is not covering it anymore. } Nxc3 {White can take because the rook in a1 is defended by the knight but... why getting into this kind of danger? Here, Rc1 would have been very nice. I overlooked it, but I  found this nice move: } 15. Bxd6 {Black can't afford to take the bishop, because his knigt will be lost for nothing but a pawn. So...} Qc6 {! Mantaining the pressure. But black is minus a piece, don't forget it. White can even think about castling kingside, now, but this is not my style! Now, you see, I can defend the bishop putting it on e7. As long as the knight stays in g6 (and I don't see how black can get rid of it, safely, in a couple of moves., the bishop is safe. But I want to attack. Besides: black has f5!, and e5! I can't lose time, not a single move. I have to force... } 16. Ne7+ Rxe7 {Black loses an exchange in addition to his piece, and still has a hanging knight...} 17. Bxe7 {I lost my wonderful knight on g6, but I still control the game, and I am far ahead in developement. Note that the dangerous black rook is gone, and with it the danger of black's opening the central pawns. Sometimes I am glad when in a blitz I can "sense" (more than actually calculate) these things.  On the other side, I didn't realize, during the game, that I was actually up in material. I completely overlooked it, and I played just looking for the best move, and no mistakes... as if we were even. } Ne4 {By retiring, black loses a most important developement tempo, but he had no choice (maybe Nb5 was slightly better). Still without thinking about material at all, I followed my most useful principle: don't give the opponent...} 18. Rc1 {...not a single tempo. "I can't allow black to reorganize itself". It cames out to be the best strategy altogether. } Qd7 {Can you see the consecuence of black's delayed developement? The c8 bishop is guarded only by the queen, so my bishop isn't really threatened at all. I can proceed snatching the central pawn. I hate to lose the lsb, but the Nc5, NxN, RxN plan seemed a little "naive" to me, leading to a slow endgame (on a "serious" game, of course, I would have acted differently).} 19. Bxe4 dxe4 20. Qxe4 {Now white has no attack left, but... has the material. Black has to develop, now or never. Nc6 is called for. } Qxe7 {...but black just snatched the bishop, thinkin it was a present. Timeo danae et dones ferentes (or similar, forgive me for not check it out).} 21. Rxc8+ Kf7 {Here, my opponent resigned. He probably just realized his material disadvantage and cramped position. But I explored the game by myself, and found very interesting material. } 22. Qh7 {White threatens Qg8 mate, and black can't do anything. Qb4+ and the white king just goes away and finally finds safety on the kingside. I found no perpetual. So, the only other move black has is } f5 {...opening a square for the king. The question is: has white a forced mate, or will he win by force many more moves ahead? White has plenty of choices, including Nc5. White must not take the pawn carelessly, or exf5+ will cause unnecessary weakness in white's position. } 23. Qg8+ {So let's try the forcing line. } Kg6 {No gxf5+, as said before. And of course I can go RxN, but this is not the idea. } 24. Re8 {Inviting black to take away the queen with the useless checks. } Qc7 {Black can't avoid white to take e6 with check, so tries to find a square. } 25. Rxe6+ Kg5 {...but g7 is defended. And where's the mate? It cames h4+, but Kf4 (not Kxg4 or the white rooks enters into the fry, and goodbay Mr. Black. } 26. Qf8 {I tired this move, with a lot of interesting tactics behind. If fxg4, hxg4 and I can bet is mate in few moves (I's check with the puzzle maker, if I have a spare time). Black has a mate threat to defend. Qf5 is impossible due to Qxg7, so...} g6 {The only way I can see. White has plenty of moves here, but still, which is better? } 27. h4+ {The alternative was gxf5. This is an almost trapped king, and it's a pity white can't play f3. } Kf4 {Again, better than Kxg4, or I think so, since I can't see any defence against Rxg6+. } 28. Rxg6 {This is not a check, but it MUST force a mate... mustn't it?} Qd7 {The black queen reinforces f5. } 29. Nc5 {The black queen can't leave f5 undefended, not even for Qxd4. } Qd5 {But it still has this square, threatening my rook with check. Of course I can win by Qxf5+, forcing the queen's exchange, but I wanted to look for a forced mate. Am I missing something? } 30. Rh3 {Further restricting black's king movements. Black can't go Qg2 or Qxf5#.} Nd7 {Desperately. If white takes the rook, black can have a chance with NxN (not Qg2, or Ne6#!). } 31. Ne6+ {I tried with Nd3+, but Ke4, then Kxd4... I coudn't find a mate. Can you? Am I missing something? Now, the text move forces...} Qxe6+ {But it is not a bad way out for black. } 32. Rxe6 Rxf8 {White is still +4, but I COULDN'T FIND A FORCED MATE ANYWHERE! But look: don't we have a forced mate with Re5-r3? No, because of fxg4. I can avoid this by g5, and it is probably the best move. But I tried...} 33. gxf5 Rxf5 34. Ree3 {The other line is Re7, and it is probably better, even if after Rd5 by black I couldn't see any interesting line, so I went through this trying to look for a forced mate. My plan is to force the black king on the h column and play with the rook's mate threat. The whole Re7 thing will be useful "in order to have the tempo to play Rg7 once the black king is in the h column. Moreover: I don't have to care for my h pawn. Actually, I must welcome black for taking it provided I can play Rg7 safely on the next move." By playing right now the rook to g6 with the same purpose is pointless, since the black king can escape to e4, d4 etc. } Rf8 {No much choice for black. There is no way black can avoid a check on the f file (I didn't explore Kg4 at once, I confess...). I just tried to have the black rook defended.} 35. Rhf3+ Kg4 36. Rfg3+ Kh5 {Black can choose to go backwards Kf5, g6, c7, and the victory would have been slow and uninsteresting. What if... (surprises are coming)} 37. Re7 {White goes for the previous plan, welcoming black's Kxh4. } Nf6 {Black apparently gives away g7 and the queen pawns. But if white goes...} 38. Reg7 {...following his plan, look: } Re8+ {Nothing dangerous, isn't it? Of course, if Re3, RxR and there is not short-term mate.} 39. Kf1 {Let's make it clear: Black can't take the h4 pawn not because the next is mate, but because "after Rg1, the next is mate". Which is different. } Ne4 {This just seems to be in favour of white's plans. } 40. Rg3g1 {I tried with Rg2, but Nd2+, Kg1 (forced!), Re1+, Kh2 (forced!), Nf6+ and black is getting out of the trouble (even if not saving the game in the long term). But with this move, the situation is not completely solved either. } Nd2+ 41. Kg2 Re4 {Suddenly, black has some breath, threatens things and, even if hopeless, can play  some more moves. PROVIDED he doesn't take the "free" pawn (with the king). Now he can take it with the rook, and d4 too. In doing that, black will defend the knight, no it's no use to attack it with Rd1. } 42. d5 {Assuming that if Rxh4 is taboo, due to d6. Black will be forced to leave the h column to prevent queening, and white will mate with Rh1. } Rd4 {White can defend with Re7, but self-blocks the pawn... for a long while. It seems that white, for a slight oversight, allowed a lot to black. Long term strategy... very difficult. } 43. Rxb7 {The only reason white should abandon the g column must be to assure the win... in a "non spectacular" way, sigh...} Rxd5 {Maybe for black is wiser to take out the king from this nasty hole where is it in. White has to choose among Rd1, pinning the knight, or...} 44. Rxa7 Ne4 {Black ha to choose among 1. taking the king out from the cage (Kg4), avoiding the pin, and take freely and safely the h white pawn. Better was Nc5, but black can't succeed in stopping white pawns... does he?} 45. b4 Rd2 46. Rf1 Rb2 47. a3 {White pawns come here and no more, for the moment. } Kxh4 {...and black takes free the h pawn, finally, getting a free pawn of his own... the game still offers some juice...} 48. Re7 {If Rg7, Ng5 and black momentarily stops white's mate threats.} Nd2 49. Rc1 {The check is better, since it wins black's h pawn. You can see it in two moves. } Kg4 {...or Ra2 at once. } 50. Re2 {White seizes a way to attack, threating f3+, Rc5+ etc, finding the tempo to defend the a pawn, at the least. Black must be aware of Rd1. The question is: Will white win the knight? No, not now, because after Rd1, Nc5 would be just an exchange (leaving black with a lost engame anyway). I've spent some fun moments looking at that. My answer is "no", even with the rook checks here and there. Am I right?} h5 {Black doesn't lose time trying to get the white pawns. His only chance is forcing something with the pawn and the knight, if white allows it. } 51. Rd1 {Let's explore the Rd1 way. Black can sac the knight with a h4+ the next move. Can he?} Nc4 {This is the "exchange" variation. } 52. Rxb2 Nxb2 53. Ra1 h4 54. a4 h3+ 55. Kh2 {White is so sure he has won, that plays carelessly...} Nd3 56. a5 Nxf2 57. a6 Kh4 58. a7 Ng4+ 59. Kg1 {...allowing black in building a very sneaky try to get out of the loss and get a perpetual (one more juicy moment in this crazy game). The threat is: h2+, Kh1 (or h1=Q). After Kh3, a8=Q, Nf2+ and white must accept the perpetual, maybe. But black tried to get things even more "tied up" by...} Kg3 {Letting white queen the pawn. } 60. a8=Q h2+ 61. Kf1 {Forced.} Ne3+ {White has two squares: e1 and e2. With the latter, the game is lost for black. No checks, and no threatening queening. So white could play carelessly. With a black bishop on g6, it may well become a tactic-problem-like position. Thank you for reading, I hope you amused yourself for a while. :-)} 62. Ke1 Ng2+ 63. Kd1 {}
