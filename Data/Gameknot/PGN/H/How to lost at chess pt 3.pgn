1. e4 {For me this was another game that increased my slide down the ratings. Computer analysis is available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17505798&fb=1&rnd=0.9036764656193554} d5 {I'm still experimenting with the scandinavian, perhaps I should try something new} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 c6 {The computer says a6 is best here but I'm not sure why it's that much better} 6. Bc4 Bf5 7. O-O Nbd7 8. Re1 e6 9. Bg5 Be7 {Keeping my castling options open for now to try to keep my opponent guessing} 10. Qd2 O-O-O 11. Re2 Rhg8 {Computer prefers Bg4 here but I wanted to line my rook up with the white king then push his dsb away} 12. Rd1 h6 13. Bf4 Qb4 {pretty much forced, the computer likes this move though and for the first time in the game it gives me a very slight edge.} 14. b3 g5 {Trying to get my pawn storm going} 15. Bg3 Nh5 {White is going to lose his dsb and I should be able to disrupt the pawns in front of his king} 16. Qe3 Nxg3 17. hxg3 Nf8 {The plan here was to defend the e6 pawn but the computer says this is a mistake, preferring the admittedly tempting g4} 18. Ne5 Rg7 19. Nxc6 {The computer describes this sac as a mistake but I am not so sure as white is opening lines around my king} bxc6 20. Ba6+ Kb8 {The computer prefers Kd7. I had completely overlooked what was to come.} 21. Qe5+ Bd6 22. Qxg7 {As I said earlier I had managed to miss this but the knight gives some compensation and the computer still indicates the game is fairly even} Qxc3 23. Qxf7 Qb4 {Prevents the immediate Qb7#, the computer gives Bc7 as better} 24. d5 {The computer calls this a mistake, preferring c3} Rd7 {This is the blunder that finally lost the game. I thought I had all the angles covered but I had only ensured that all my pieces were defended when I should have ensured that the squares were covered, in particular e8.  Best move is cxd8. The computer gives this as a mate in 9} 25. Qe8+ Kc7 26. Qc8+ {At this point I thought I still had an escape square on a5} Kb6 27. dxc6 {Qxc7 is better here} Rc7 28. Qd8 Kxc6 {This is another catastrophic blunder, Be7 is better} 29. Rxd6+ Qxd6 {Trying to force an exchange of queens. As I am still one point ahead on material it would give me an advantage} 30. Bb5+ {White is having none of it, clearly Kxb5 loses my queen} Kc5 31. b4+ {Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed this game.   Please comment}
