1. e4 d6 {OUCH! My finger slipped from a Scandinavian to the "awful" Pirc! I hate it because Korchnoy lost his almost historic turn-up in a world champion match with it. } 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 b6 {Completely into darkness, I thought that this would have forced him into d5 sooner or later, defining the center at least. } 4. Bc4 {Still not dangerous, but aiming at f7. I hate Pirc!} Bb7 {Targeting e4. He can easily defend it with f3, but it compromises a little his Kside. Not a problem, but he could have feared it. If e5, I'm prepared to play the exchange and accept QxQ and playing without castling. A Q move is also good for white, but he...} 5. d5 {Just found it too juicy to make of my lsb a "blind" one. Now, a good idea can be Ba6. This forces white to exchange the b or condemn his to b3. } Nbd7 {This can't be bad. } 6. Bg5 {Uncovering his cards very quickly. } h6 7. Bh4 {g5... not so easy. It can be interesting to own e5 a move more. I want to play Ne5, threatening the lsb, but I can't due to Bb5+. So I think that, even if it is not a developing move again, } a6 {...is needed. } 8. f3 {? White deprives his N from his best square for no reason. This indicates that white wants to move actions into the queenside: Bf2, Nc3 free to jump somewhere... can it be? } Ne5 {Some breath!} 9. Be2 g5 {More space, please, more lines!} 10. Bf2 {Ah, as I expected. Now I have to be very aware of sacs on the Qside. } Bg7 {Not great, but needed. I won't castle since white is well placed on both flankes and owns the center. I have to be very, very wise to survive. } 11. Qd2 {f4 can't be played yes, because of Ne-g4, exchanging one of the two B. I could well have played Ng6, but I wanted to play g4. } Qd7 {Preventing Na4, with a possible sac on b6, and reinforcing g4 in case of f4. I can't play g4 myself now because after f4, my Ne4 has to retire to g6, and I didn't want to allow that, if possible. } 12. O-O-O {Interesting. Now I know where my target is. My dsb is warming up. But in all this mess, I saw an interesting consecuence of the WK and Q's position, one players often overlook;} h5 {White can't play Qxg5, or Bh6 will win the WQ. } 13. f4 {? White didn't calculate that after...} gxf4 {...the issue remains unvaried! f4 is untouchable, and if Kb1, I can defend it somehow. } 14. Kb1 Nfg4 {...but, as always, I wanted more. This threatens a fork on f2. } 15. Bxg4 {White gave up his B pair. These are great news. Now, it was a blitz: QxB, aiming for g2, is hard to assess, after QxB, 16. Nf3, Qxg2!? 17. Rhg1, QxNf3, 18. RxBg7, Ng5!... / hxB joins the two pawns, cramps white's N developement, but unfortunately the alternate one, Ne2, was goo enough for him. Nxg5 loses an insider piece (compared to QxB), but keeps the threat of NxB or Nf2, adding Ne3 - in some lines to the bargain. Do your homework...} Nxg4 {?? Bad, because in all the things I considered before, I "lost" the simple fact that my dangerous N move was done "despite the threat on f4, now active". QxB was the right one, since it prevented Qxf4. } 16. Bd4 {White has the upper hand, here: either if I exchange or if I don't, his Q controls f2, so my N has nothing. Ne3 is possible if the dsb's are exchanged, but if I do, on d4 the WQ threats my Rh8 with check...mate! So, as I said, I have to be very, very careful! Now, I took the position exactly as one of the ones I'm working on Tactic Trainer (I'm recently over 1900 over there)...} Bxd4 17. Qxd4 {At least, I diverted the WQ from f4. Now I have a lot of moves, but I "saw on time" I can't play e5 (dxe6ep and I'm lost). But Ne5 was just sooo passive...} O-O-O {I think that now white is not very well placed to penetrate my K's fortress, now. The consecuences of c5 must be re-calculated now, joning them with the fact that if the WQ moves or is exchanged, I have Nf2... } 18. h3 {Ok, but my N still has a wonderful square!} Ne3 19. Re1 {I'm ok losing N and pawn for a R. But maybe I was wrong. I could have taken g2 for free, but I felt I needed to "build up" some more before acting. } Rdg8 {?? This R is useless, here, due to the WQ's threat! It can't move at all! I moved the bad R. Throwing the game away...} 20. g4 {I can't take ep or I'll lose the N. So} hxg4 {hxg is impossible: thanks to white's misunderstanding of the situation, now my R's are more powerful than before, even after my mistake. } 21. Nge2 {Threatening f4 again, and now I have no B to defend it. What to do? } Ng2 {Oh, this is just mad. } 22. Reg1 {Ok, now look at this: f3? 23. hxg4, and if RxRh1, 24. RxR, fxNe2, 25. Nxe2 (forced or e1). } Rxh3 {Riding off of the "problematic" R on h8, and if RxR, gxR defends the N. BUT white will win the tactic, because of after Nxf4, I can't take it back due to the undefended Rg8!!!} 23. Rxh3 gxh3 24. Nxf4 {He saw it... :-( Now, on a timed game, I (and he) should have seen the key move some moves ahead, but it must be said that the involved tactics (look at the ugly position of the BK, exposed to any R8+... not easy to keep everything under control! Fortunately, I put my "Tactic Trainer mind" in mode "on" and found the answer.} h2 {I am +2, despite the pawn (but actually my lsb is not playing), and as a minimum I'll win the exchange (after NxN, hxR=Q, QxQ, Qh3!, winning the N too! Another tactic motiv here...} 25. Rxg2 {Still the best move? No, I queen with check, and if Rg1, RxR is mate anywhere. } h1=Q+ 26. Nd1 {Well, now I still have to cope with RxR, so...} Rxg2 27. Nxg2 {I can take the N, and with +10 materia points the game is won. } Qg4 {...but I wanted to play elegantly and mate now. } 28. Nge3 {Very strong defence! I can sac a Q, but it must be for mate. And my lsb is still not playing. } Qgg1 {This leaves very few moves to white. } 29. b3 {White frees his K. Now the game is another one. I have two queens, and the N are native forkers, so be careful. Remember that if ever white's Q reaches e8, it's mate for me, with all my Queens. } Kb8 {White is completely pinned, so I have time to shield my K on a7. } 30. Kb2 {freeing one N. } f6 {Stopping any Qh8's incursion. The white square's weakness doesn't bother me because I have a "free" lsb to guard it all (except e7) from the WQ. I can afford to lose e7 if I have a plan involving surpassing the two-N's barrier wihout sacrifying a Q. How?} 31. Qa4 {White spots the white hole", but now it is not all that dangerous. BUT it gave me an idea. } Qh8 {I would put a ! on this simple move. The idea is it unfolds f5+, and if Nf5 (to stop it), QxNd1.  } 32. Qd7 {? Ok, take e7 if you want... you just let me in!} f5+ 33. Ka3 f4 {The idea is to free the way for the Q to c5. It "must" mate, isn't it?} 34. Nf5 {...no, it doesn't mate, because after Qc5+, b4! It does mate, because of Qh8-h3+!} Qxd1 {? I didn't see it, and I thought mate was near all the same. } 35. Nxe7 {A threat: Nc6+. } Qc1+ 36. Ka4 {Again, b5+, Ka5, Qc3+, g4 gives white a tempo, is not forced. I have few seconds left, and I can't risk "something weird" on c6. Now, on post view, I realize I had nothing to fear about. But, "just in case", I'll add a defender to c6 without leaving the guard of the 8th rank!} Qxc2 {It also threatens a lot of deadly checks. White is lost. } 37. Nc6+ {Only useless try.} Bxc6+ 38. dxc6 b5+ 39. Kb4 Qc5+ {No tricks now. A sad end for my opponent who, despite his low rating, "saw" a lot of things and tricks during the game, and defended bravely, until the unavoidable crash. I made many mistakes, and just had the luck they were not such terrible and my opponene didn't take proper advantage of them. But, more than all, a game with a lot of tactic motivs that can be interesting to explore for beginners. Two opposite back rank mate or deadly check threats, a twoQ vs Q and 2N very unusual board... I hope you enjoyed it, and pleas let me know the flaws and the overviews! I'll appreciate them!}
