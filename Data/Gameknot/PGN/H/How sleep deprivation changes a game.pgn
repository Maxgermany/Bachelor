1. Nc3 {In this particular game, I did not play well because I was tired and was up for 22 hours with only 6 hours of sleep because of a special party. As you could probably see, I inadvertently allowed my opponent to play a fork against me between my king and queen with his knight. I made a couple of mistakes, but my biggest mistake was on my last move with Nc4. For someone who was fatigued, however, this was the best game that I ever played because I tried my best to play well. This game was a learning experience for me. I learned that one cannot play chess as well when he or she is tired. It is also better to get enough sleep before playing chess, and/or it is not a good time to play chess if one is tired. Instead, one should take a break and wait to get their energy back before returning to chess, if it is feasible. In addition, it might be good to set the time control for a longer period. In other words, it is a good idea to consider changing the automatic decline challenge if one knows that he or she might get tired later in the day because it could take a while, and possible one or two days, to recover from tiredness.  } e5 2. e4 {I had to play e4 before my opponent played e4.  That way, I could play Nf3 on my next move, without the pawn threatening my knight with exf3.} Nf6 3. Nf3 Bc5 4. b3 {This was not a great move.  Instead, I should have played Nxe5.  This way, I would have gotten a free pawn.} Ng4 {Because I was fatigued and my ears were in pain, I got paranoid that my knight was pinning me.  If I had been more careful about this, I would have seen that his knight was a big threat and would play a powerful fork against me between my rook on the h square and my queen on the d square, with Nxf2. } 5. h3 {Because I got paranoid, I threatened his knight with exg4, by playing h3.  Now he is able to get a free pawn and play a powerful fork against me, as I mentioned earlier.} Nxf2 6. Qe2 {Now that he played the fork, I had to play Qe2 in order to avoid loosing my queen.} Nxh1 {Even though, he captured my rook, I was determined not to resign at this point because I was still following Jack Stockel's advice to not resign or give up easily.} 7. Nxe5 {Instead, I got a free pawn with Nxe5, but it was too late because he was going to play another powerful fork between my queen on the e square and my bishop on the f square with Ng3.  There was no way around this fork, but I was still determined to follow Jack Stockel's advice and not resign.} Ng3 8. Qg4 {Because he played the fork, I had to move my queen away from danger in order to avoid loosing the queen.} Bd6 9. Qxg7 {This was the best move for this position because it put pressure on his rook, and it prevented from exchanging my bishop with Nxf1.} Rf8 10. Qxg3 {This was a bad move, even though it is usually a good candidate.  That is because he could have played Bxe5 and forced an exchange, but that would not be so bad.  Instead, he played something that was much worse for my position with Qe7.} Qe7 {His move not only put pressure on my knight, but it also put pressure on my queen.  That is because my knight was pinned, at this point, and this pin was powerful.  I actually realized this, on my next move, after moving the knight because I was actually falling asleep, at this moment.} 11. Nc4 {That was my biggest mistake because of his next move. } Bxg3+ {During this move not only did he capture my queen, but he also got this free queen.  In other words, I inadvertently gave him a free queen because it was not exchanged.  In addition, this capture put me in a serious, not a nuisance, check.  At this point, I was no longer able to follow Jack Stockel's advice about resignation.  At this point, I had to resign because I was in a loosing position, and there was no way around this one.  In fact, Jack Stockel would agreed to this, and he would say to me, "Now, you can resign".    }
