1. e3 {I'm not real familiar with playing against an E3 opening.  I was taught that I needed to be more aggressive in my first moves, so this is "out of my book".  I just play for control of the center like I was brought up.} e5 {"Logical Chess, Move by Move" by Iving Chernev.  Unsure whether I should respond with e6 or d6 I flip a coin.} 2. Qh5 {Clearly the wrong choice.  } Nc6 {I want to attack his queen, but I have to support that pawn.} 3. Bc4 {There's the threat...} d5 {I desperately want to punish him for bringing out his queen so early, but mate on f7 would suck, big time.} 4. Bb3 Nf6 {There's what I've been waiting for!} 5. Qf3 {And with him on the run...} Bg4 {I continue my attack...} 6. Qg3 {I consider h5 here, but I want to stay aggresive and that just seems to give away the tempo.} Bd6 {So I bring up my kings bishop thinking that with 6. ... e4 I may be able to trap his queen over on that side of the board} 7. Bxd5 {But I overlook that my knight is pulling double duty and promtly lose a pawn.  That sucks.} h5 {Better late than never, I support my bishop like I should have done earlier.} 8. e4 {Now he starts competing for the center and I'm pissed at myself} O-O {But I've learned my lesson in this game and start gathering up my defenses before I go on the attack.} 9. h3 {Now I've got to go almost all the way home because of my blunder} Bd7 {I consider Be3, but down in material I need to avoid trading pieces and muster up a counter attack.} 10. d3 {He supports his center pawn and I look for an opening.} Re8 {With his bishop on a clear path to h6 I need to avoid mate on g7.  I plan to counter Bh6 with g6, but that would cost me my rook unless I move him.} 11. Bh6 {A good move.  I'm really fighting for survival now.} Bf8 {With the KB pawn pinned, g6 will avoid mate, but only temporarily.  I'm not sure if I saw that when I moved the rook, I think I just got lucky I had an out.} 12. Bc4 {???  What a peculiar move.  I had to stop for a second to make sure there wasn't something subtle going on that I didn't see.} Kh8 {In the end, I just have to get rid of that pin, and it's nice that I can do it with tempo.  Speaking of tempo, I think that last move was the turning point of the game.} 13. Bg5 {Knight pinned on the queen, but I can live with that for a little while.} Nd4 {Looking at the knight fork on c2, I'll counter 14. Bb3 with Be6.  I don't see much of a way out of it for him.} 14. Na3 {Except that, duh...  I swear, you take a year off and everything goes to hell.} Bxa3 {But I'll trade my Bishop for that fork on c2, now he's kinda in a bad way.} 15. bxa3 {And here I think I have the game wrapped up.} Nxc2+ {Bam.} 16. Kf1 {Whlte loses his privilege to castle and I pick up his rook.} Nxa1 {As usual with these forks, my knight is way the hell on the other side of the board.  I could use him over on my king side, but I'm okay with that for now.} 17. Bxf7 {I knew that was a possibility, but I was dead set on that rook, now I ponder where to put my rook to best set myself up for the rest of the game.} Re7 {I'd rather have the knight pinned on my rook than my old lady.  Plus, I'm looking at Bxh5... if I play Rf8 then I just lose the pawn and I'm in a very ugly position.  At least this way we're in a Mexican standoff and even it we swap material, getting his bishops away from my king is definitely worth the rook and pawn.} 18. Bxh5 {Saw that, I had this next move in a conditional.} Nxh5 {Now I'm  6 and I'm living large} 19. Qh4 {Until evilc reveals just how evilc he is.  I can't believe I didn't see that after all the other pins I've been working out of through this game.} Kg8 {All I saw was the attack on the queen and a tempo, now I've got to give up the knight and the rook and I'm on the ropes again...} 20. Qxh5 {I'll still be  1 after he exchanges his bishop for my rook, but I'm not happy about this turn of events.  I need to go on the offensive and get my pieces unbunged from around my queen.} Bb5 {I've got a knight in BFE, but he's got an undeveloped king's knight and a rook that ain't going anywhere for a while, I guess castling is a good idea when you can.  If he'd developed his knight instead of that odd, odd move 12, this could be a totally different game.  But I see the attack through the d-pawn and start dialing in on it.  I love the pin with the discovered attack from my old girl, plus grabbing the d file and giving Martha room to breath.} 21. Bxe7 {I let him have the cannon, my eye is on the prize.  I think he may have done better by bringing out the knight to interpose, but I don't know if it would have done that much.} Qxd3+ {Bam.  And I start entering my conditionals.  I don't see a way out for him.  Interposing can't help and Ke1 loses to Nc2.  I guess he wasn't out of the game after all.} 22. Qe2 {It's inevitable...} Qd1# {Just two missed tempos in the game by white and I was able to make up a pawn blunder.  This game is so awesome.  Trying to explain chess to someone that doesn't get it is like trying to explain color to a blind person.}
