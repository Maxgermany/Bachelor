1. e4 Nf6 {Here I'm black playing the Alekhine defense on a blitz game.} 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 {Here reach an often seen position with this opening.} 5. exd6 {Well I think it would have been better to strenghten his position with f4 or Nf3 rather than to lose a pawn in the middle.} cxd6 {Keeping my e pawn for later, when I will want to pierce the middle.} 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. Nf3 g6 {I've not studied that much this opening, but the fianchetto look to give a better position for black.} 8. Be3 Bg7 9. a3 O-O 10. Bd3 e5 11. d5 Ne7 12. Qb3 Nf5 13. Bxf5 Bxf5 14. Ng5 {?! I don't understand the purpose of this move.} Rc8 {Now my position look just fine!} 15. Bxb6 Qxg5 {! Now white must lose his g pawn.} 16. Bxa7 Qxg2 17. O-O-O {Now white position is almost hopeless.} Bh6+ 18. Be3 {The only move he could do to safe his king, not really thought about it.  Maybe Rc5! would have been the best continuation on move 17, blocking his bishop.} Bxe3+ 19. fxe3 Rxc4 {! The queen cannot move, she must watch Qc2#. The knight is pinned.} 20. Rhg1 {?! Looklike a nervous move. A waste of time, he's just gonna lose a pawn.} Qxh2 21. Rge1 Rfc8 22. Rd2 {The only way to deliver her queen.} Qg3 {Threatening both his rook and e pawn.} 23. Rde2 h5 {Bg4 would have probably be the best continuation here, forcing white to lose a rook. But I had another idea in my head I wanted to try.} 24. Kd2 h4 25. Qxb7 h3 26. Qe7 h2 {Now my pawn gonna be ready for a promotion.} 27. Qxd6 Rd4+ {! If Qc1 then Rd3, ready to do Rxe3. Well Bg4 would have had almost the same effect. } 28. exd4 Qd3+ 29. Kc1 Qxe2 {! Another solution: Qb1+ 30.Kd2 Qxb2+ 31.Ke3 Qxc3+ 32.Kf2 Qxd4 33.Kg2 Qg4+ 34.Kxh2 (Kh1 Bd3) Qh3+ 35.Kg1 Qg3+ 36.Kh1 Rc4 37.Qd8+ Kg7 and mate is coming...} 30. Rxe2 h1=Q+ {Now white have less pieces to protect his king and my position is nice.} 31. Kd2 Qa1 {!} 32. Qb4 exd4 {The knight cannot move because of Qc1#. 33.Nd1 Qc1+ 34.Ke1 Bg4! 35.Qxd4(if Rd2 then Re8+) Bxe2 36.Kxe2 Rc2+ 37.Ke1 Rh2 38.Qd3 Qg5(the knight will follow shortly). If 33.Qxd4 Qxb2+ 34.Kd1(if Ke3 Qxc3+) Qb3+ 35.Kd2 Qc2+ 36.Ke3 Qxc3+} 33. Re1 dxc3+ 34. bxc3 Qa2+ 35. Ke3 {The king can't go to d1 because of Qc2#.} Re8+ {White must now lose his rook.} 36. Kd4 Qf2+ {! This way black can take his tower and his king stays protected. White resigned here.}
