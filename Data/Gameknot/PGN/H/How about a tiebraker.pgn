1. e4 e5 2. d4 {Playing for the Danish Gambit.} c6 {Don't recognize this... Don't think it's common or good.} 3. dxe5 {It's a pawn.} d6 4. exd6 Bxd6 {So now he made this weird sacrifice and he got almost nothing for it. Not worth it if you ask me.} 5. Bc4 Qe7 {?! I don't think this is great, I can defend and develop at the same time.} 6. Nc3 b5 7. Bb3 Nf6 8. Qd3 Ba6 {Threatens b4} 9. Qe3 Bc5 {Chasing my queen.} 10. Qf3 O-O 11. Bg5 {Develops and pins.} Nbd7 12. Bxf6 {? Bad.} Nxf6 13. Nge2 Bb4 14. O-O Bb7 {Lining up his bishop with my queen.} 15. a3 Bd6 16. Rfe1 {Targeting his queen.} Qe5 17. Ng3 {Black has better piece activity, but white has an extra pawn. Very close to equal.} b4 18. axb4 Bxb4 {Now my rook has a half open file, but he has pressure on my knight.} 19. Re3 Bc8 20. Nf5 {Nice spot for my knight.} g6 {Not as bad as it looks ad I don't have a DSB anymore.} 21. Nh6+ Kg7 22. Qh3 {I still can't believe I did this, I just didn't notice his bishop.} Bxh3 {I really thought about resigning, but I was glad I didn't.} 23. Rxh3 Bxc3 24. bxc3 {Taking with the rook would lose my knight.} Nxe4 25. Ng4 Qc5 26. Re1 f5 27. Ne3 {At this point I am down by six, and it looks lost for me.} Qxc3 {Was this an oversight or was this purposely played to exchange off material even at the cost of his queen?} 28. Nxf5+ Rxf5 29. Rxc3 Nxc3 {Things still look bleak, down by a full rook there looks to be no hope for me.} 30. Re7+ Kh6 31. g4 Rf4 {! Wins a pawn.} 32. Re3 Nd1 {! Secures the pawn.} 33. Rh3+ Kg7 34. Rg3 {I decided it would be better to defend this one.} Rxf2 35. Rd3 Nb2 {?? Gives the game back to me, perhaps he was counting on Rd7+ Rf7 and he didn't notice the bishop.} 36. Rd7+ Kh6 37. Rc7 {????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Somehow I didn't notice that the rook was available!} Rf6 {WAAAAAAHHHH Now I was feeling REALLY demoralized and was inches from resignation.} 38. h4 {Threatens a fork.} Rd6 39. g5+ {Played anyway.} Kh5 40. Rxh7+ {One pawn.} Kg4 41. Kg2 Rd2+ 42. Kf1 Re8 {His pieces swarm for a mating attack.} 43. Bf7 Ree2 44. Bxg6 {Another pawn and now my queen pawns look a little dangerous.} Ref2+ 45. Ke1 Rfe2+ 46. Kf1 Kf3 {Threatens mate, but overlooks...} 47. Bh5+ {THIS!} Ke3 48. Re7+ {!! Realizing I can win even more with this.} Kf4 49. Rxe2 Nc4 50. Rxd2 Nxd2+ {Now it looks like the game might be in my reach.} 51. Ke2 Ne4 52. g6 {And I give it right back with this blunder.} Ng3+ {*Groan*} 53. Kd3 Nxh5 54. Kd4 {Now I fight for a draw.} a5 55. Kc5 Ke4 56. Kc4 {Taking his pawn would be suicide.} Ng7 57. Kb3 Kd4 {I believe this position would be a draw.} 58. Ka4 Kc4 59. Kxa5 c5 60. Kb6 Kd4 61. c3+ {Wanting to exchange pawns.} Kc4 62. Kc6 Kxc3 63. Kxc5 {Now black is fighting for a draw but there is no way for white to win that I can see.} Kd3 64. Kd6 Ke4 65. Ke7 Kf5 66. Kf7 Nh5 67. g7 {And draw. I saw that he could take my pawn with his knight and then take my other pawn with his king after which it would be draw by insufficient material. Good game stealth!}
