1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bd3 {4.e5... (Winawer variation) is the most common line, as well as 4.Bd2...} c5 5. Be3 Nc6 {The luring 6.dxc5?... is an error, and is met with 6...d4 -/+} 6. a3 Ba5 {My bishop remains powerful, since 7.b4... brings material grief to White, and White will soon be closed down.} 7. exd5 exd5 8. Bb5 c4 {Doubled pawns on the c-file aren't the worst thing that can happen. I can respond by capturing on c3. Also, the d3-square is now secure.} 9. Bxc6+ bxc6 10. Nge2 Bf5 {Although White has superior development, his pieces are stifled in his own half, supressed by my long-range.} 11. O-O Nf6 {e4 is beginning to weaken.} 12. Ng3 {A complex array of variations has occured. I can capture on the c-file... V1 - 12...Bxc3 13.Nxf5 Bxb2 14.Nxg7+...with an unbalanced and precocious position for Black in exchange for queenside weakening. V2 - 12...Bxc3 13.bxc3... Unlikely, but possible, with even chances.} Bg6 13. Re1 O-O {White's c3-knight is pinned again, but a dangerous rook on the e-file threatens me greatly. The key is to double pawns on the c-file, then try to dominate the b-file with a rook.} 14. Bf4 {Now the question is whether to dominate the b-file or the e-file. For now, the e-file isn't necessary, so I'll attack from the flank. If I exchange on the e-file, then the c3-knight regains usefulness. Also, the bishop on f4 is now attacking the b8-square.} Bc7 {If White tries Nc3-Na4-Nc5, then Nd7! solves all.} 15. Bxc7 Qxc7 {White's most powerful piece is gone. Both sides are now firing from their bass line.} 16. a4 {My prediction was of White to utilise the a4-square to manoeuvre his c3-knight to c5. Whilst the a4-pawn contests b5, it blocks access.} Rfe8 {The position that has arisen is roughly equal (since both the c6 + b2-pawns are backward).} 17. Re3 {If I exchange, a second pawn is lured into play.} a6 {Although away from the action, when I attempt to swap-off my doubled pawn on c5, I must cover the b5-square from becoming an outpost for the c3-knight.} 18. a5 c5 {White moves the outpost to b6, but I can cover with Nd7.} 19. Rxe8+ Rxe8 {The swap-off on e8 gives me unprecedented control over the e-file. I predict (20.dxc5 Qxc5 21.Ne4... and 22.Nb6...)} 20. Nge2 {Instead, White places for improved position. The recapture on d4 now benefits White, so it would be illogical. I need to counteract this. Also, 20...Nd7 leaves d5 undefended.} Rb8 21. Qc1 {White now threatens on e3 and f4.} cxd4 22. Nxd4 Qc5 23. Nce2 {The knight on d4 doesn't have much to aim at. Also, e4 is now undefended.} Nd7 {I must now manoeuvre to c6 and create an exchange, or else lose material.} 24. h3 {(?!)} Ne5 {White could have tried to reinforce d4 with c3, even if it would gift me control of the b1-h7 diagonal. This seems a wasted opportunity.} 25. g3 {White now appears to close down the activity of my minor pieces. An advance on the kingside might allow for a counterpunch.} Nc6 26. Nxc6 Qxc6 {The position is roughly equal. White can advance with 27.f4... closing down my bishop, but I can try and dominate the centre.} 27. Nd4 Qc5 28. c3 {White anchors the knight, but he is pinned should the f-pawn move.} Bd3 {28...Be4 is better, but can be removed with 29.f3...} 29. Ra2 {Preparing for 30.Qf4..., which threatens my back rank.} Re8 30. b3 {White now attempts to reduce my centre. I won't exchange on b3 to keep my stance.} h6 31. bxc4 dxc4 {The White knight is limited to f3.} 32. Ra1 {(?!) Little is achieved with White's drop-back. No crucial squares are attacked.} g5 33. f4 f6 {The queen is cut off from f4, and I can play my bishop to e4 if I want.} 34. fxg5 fxg5 35. Qb2 {White threatens with 36.Qb6..., 36.Qb4..., and maybe 36.Qb7...} Re7 36. Qb8+ Kf7 {My king and rook have advanced, whilst White's queen will assault a6.} 37. Qb6 Qc7 {If 38.Qxa6... or 38.Qxh6... then 38...Qxg3 benefits Black.} 38. Kh2 {If White ventures his king to g2, my d3-bishop will cut him down. However, 38.Kf2... would be more active.} Qb7 {If 39.Qxh6... then 39...Qb2+ provides strong winning chances for Black.} 39. Re1 {White wants to force an exchange with passed pawns on the a+b files (one for each side). However, I can intercept his passed pawn - so I will play this variation.} Qxb6 40. Rxe7+ Kxe7 41. axb6 Kd6 {My king is further developed. White's kingside access is blocked, and the passed b-pawn is doomed, whereas my passed a-pawn has prospects.} 42. h4 g4 43. Kg1 {White has too much to cover.} Be4 44. h5 Kc5 45. b7 Bxb7 46. Nf5 a5 47. Kf2 a4 48. Ke3 a3 49. Nxh6 a2 50. Nxg4 a1=Q 51. Kf4 Qxc3 52. Ne5 Qd4+ 53. Kf5 Bc8+ {White is forced to pin his own knight.} 54. Kf6 Kd5 55. h6 Qxe5+ 56. Kf7 Be6+ 57. Kg6 Qf5+ 58. Kg7 Qf7+ 59. Kh8 Qg8# {White played well tactically, and held strong central prowess. However, he miscalculated heavily with move 40.Re1..., leading to a won endgame position for myself. This concludes the series. (Honza 5.5 - 0.5 Excalibur)}
