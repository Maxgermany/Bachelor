1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 Bd6 {Early center defiance. It is not bad, but...} 4. Ne5 {Now, the best option for black is f6, rejecting the knight, that has to go to d3 to recapture the bishop after the exchange. It gives black some advantage, since the knight in f4 is not well placed. But black went...} Nd7 {...giving me a precious tempo. } 5. e3 {The queen's way to g4 or h5 is open. } Nxe5 {Not f6 now, because of Qh5+ and if g6, Nxg6. } 6. dxe5 {Kind of surprise, but this pawn will stop black's developement, at the cost of the dsb's inactivity. } Be7 7. Qg4 Bf8 {g6 can be considered better, and the weakness of the black squares is not so terrible until black's dsb is in the game. } 8. Bd3 {h4 can be a better option, to definitely grab control of the kinside. } Nh6 {Qg3 means that this knight will go to f5, and my lsb will have to exchange it, so...} 9. Bxh6 gxh6 {I will miss my dsb, but the doubled pawns on h will compensate it, I guess. Now, h4 was due, but I didn't see it. } 10. c3 {In order to control d4 and solidify, but it allowed...} Qg5 {I can retreat, but losing e5. No good. } 11. Qg3 {Sadly...} Qxg3 12. hxg3 {It's ok. I'm still better. The open column can be useful, later. } Bg7 13. f4 {Strong center. } Bd7 14. Na3 a6 {Fighting for b5} 15. c4 {Risking, taking advantage of my developement. } dxc4 16. Nxc4 {Not the best? Difficult to say. } O-O-O {Well...} 17. Rc1 {I'm not interested in casting anymore. The king belongs to f2, defending g3. } Kb8 {Of course, because of the nasty Nd6+. } 18. Be4 {Attacking, always...} Bb5 19. b3 {If he exchanges, his dsb is almost out of the game, and preparing...} Rd7 20. a4 {...this. } Bxc4 {Thank you, black... but the retreat was even worse. } 21. Rxc4 {bxB is naive, but maybe better. Anyway.} Rhd8 {Good. } 22. O-O {The rook can penetrate, but...} f6 {Good, too. He wants to free his dsb. } 23. Rb4 c6 {? A great help. If b6, a5, b5. } 24. Bxc6 Rd7d3 {Desperate, but losing. } 25. Rxb7+ {Loses a bishop with check. It worked...} Kc8 {He resigned without waiting for RxB. }
