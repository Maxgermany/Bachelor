1. e4 {On the game title question - I'm not sure!   I think this is the first time I've won with it; I've lost a few times.   It follows a big number of games, and yet I find the ideas aren't all that clear for black in particular.   So wouldn't mind sharing this game and getting ideas from other players.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {The Winawer.} Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 {The main line, though Bd2 and even Qg4 are plausible alternatives.} Bxc3+ {I think Tal in particular used to try Ba5 here.   I've tried both and prefer this.   Though I'll still dabble in the other line from time to time.} 6. bxc3 Ne7 7. Qg4 {More aggressive than the main alternative, Nf3, though the database gives a similar success rate for each move.} Qc7 {This, then, invites white to go in for the poisoned pawn line variation, where black gives up two pawns for - what, exactly?   I'm hoping for a little clarification here!   Black could just castle here instead and hope to weather the inevitable Bd3 and h4-h5-h6 attack, and if he survives, freeze the c3 pawn (with a c4 push) and target it.} 8. Qxg7 {White's up for it anyway.} Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 {So black has one pawn back (10. cd?? Qc3+) and threatens two more (c3 and e5).   General openings principles, meanwhile, are nowhere to be seen!} 10. Ne2 Nbc6 {Still following more than 1,000 previous Gameknot games!   10. ... dc is possible too, though white should be able to round it up at some stage in the near future.} 11. f4 {White can't take on d4 because of 11. cd NxP 12. Qxe5+, when c2 is also weak; going further with 12. NxN?? loses to Qc3+.   So instead, he shores up the hanging e-pawn.} Bd7 {Preparing to castle.} 12. Qd3 {Forcing the issue with black's d-pawn...} dxc3 {...so I'm forced to take.} 13. Qxc3 Nf5 {From here, so, my knowledge of what's actually going on starts to get quite vague!   We're still following 400+ GK games.   White's kingside pawn majority is a lasting advantage.   White has an extra pawn and an open b-file to attack black's king, which is invariably going to castle long.   Black has better development and is aiming to keep white's king in the centre.   I'm not entirely sure of the necessity of Nf5 at this stage though, even though it's by a distance the most-played move here.   Is it just a case that there's no rush castling, so you may as well bring the knight more into things?   Is it that there is a rush to halt the kingside pawns as soon as possible, so the knight heads towards them?} 14. Rb1 {Taking the open file; why not?} O-O-O 15. Rg1 {Preparing to push the kingside majority.} d4 {It seems black's counterplay must be in the centre.   I have nothing to speak of on either flank, and white's king can't castle, so it has to be where black plays.   I think the aim is to try blow open the centre for the major pieces?} 16. Qd3 {Still following more than 200 previous GK games!} Be8 {A bit unusual.   f6 is most common here, and black scores well.   This is less popular and less successful.   But I think the bishop is going to try hold up the kingside pawns after black eventually plays f6 anyway.} 17. g4 Nh4 {Finger in the dyke time!} 18. Rg3 f6 {Not the kind of sac you'd find over the board!   I'll admit to having one eye on the openings database (still following 26 games here) - partly out of curiosity in this line.   I've not played it in OTB chess, but it looks like something I'd like to try!   I'm assuming this is black trying to blow open the centre of the board and prize open the juicy king beneath?} 19. exf6 Bf7 {Bg6 is far more common here, hitting the queen.   Makes sense, I suppose.   Either move frees up e8 for the g-rook.} 20. Bh3 {With this, we follow just the one GK game - j0st v gjkroes from 2009.   Time to think for myself and work out just what I have going for myself in this position!} e5 {The discovered check is of no real danger.   Black, I think, must pursue this idea of opening the centre files.} 21. g5+ Kb8 22. Rg4 {Looking to remove that knight so that h4 becomes a possibility soon.   Four connected passed pawns could be quite daunting!   Though I do think this marks the start of a slow-down in white's play which could be improved upon.   But how?} Bg6 {Admitting that 19. ... Bf7 was an error, I suppose.} 23. Qg3 {Perhaps not the best.   Qc4 is the main reply to 19. ... Bg6; it stands to reason it should be best here too.   The text allows black regroup with tempo.} Nf5 24. Qb3 e4 {The outcome of the loss of that one tempo - black's pawn centre is now rolling nicely towards the white king, while white's pawns are held up for the moment.} 25. Rg2 {With the idea of BxN, getting two pieces out of the way of the h4 push.   Though black could return to h4, and white's manoeuvres have gained nothing.   There's presumably a more energetic way of playing this position for white?} d3 26. Bxf5 Bxf5 {White can now push h4-h5-h6, but never gets the time.   Clearly, he's gone wrong somewhere.  !} 27. Nc3 {27. cd is probably better, trying to break up black's pawns.} Nd4 {Homing in on the king and trying to give white as little time to himself as possible.} 28. Nd5 Nxc2+ {I thought this was going to win material.   I think I was looking at something like 29. RxN QxR 30. QxQ PxQ 31. Rb2 RxN, but it seems I completely missed 30. QxP#!   But if I move the queen instead, I should still have a good advantage.} 29. Kd2 {Thankfully, my opponent blunders even more spectacularly!} Qa5+ 30. Nc3 {Mate in four.} e3+ {Missing the mate in four, which continues with the nice diversionary sac Bg4+!   Either way, the central pawns finally roll home, though in this case, the on g2 means it doesn't lead to mate.} 31. Kd1 e2+ 32. Rxe2 {Any other move is mate.} dxe2+ 33. Kxe2 Nd4+ {And the queen is gone; white resigned.   But quite interested to hear of other people's experiences in this opening!}
