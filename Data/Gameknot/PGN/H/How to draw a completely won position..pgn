[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {My bread and butter. Because of a forfeit in our team I had the white pieces for once. The elo difference between the opponent's board 3 and 4 player was about 10 elo points, so in other words they're more or less the same strenght. The difference between both boards is of course the colour I play with. I wasn't sure before the game started whether or not the forfeit would affect anything, turns out it didn't and thus I was destined to play with the black pieces... until they threw me for a loop hole and suddenly I was playing with the white pieces. Apparently my teamcaptain registered me as the third board player. I complain a lot about my chess club, but them setting me up with the white pieces was really good thinking of our chess captain.  Kudos to him.} e6 {I don't dislike it, it's a little bit more flexible then d5.  That being said, it allows white to decide the way the game will go from here. White can play e4, which could get met with d5 and we'd be playing a french opening. Whatever I wish to play, d5 will be played sooner rather then later, that much I'm confident of.} 2. Nf3 {I decide to play a sort of waiting move. c4 or e4 were good if not better alternatives, however they give black the choice on how he wants to fight those openings. I'll allow him to get some play in first, see what he wants to do and go from there. Most likely I'll go into a queens gambit though, which is the opening I play in nearly all my games as white.} d5 3. c4 {This opening is called the queen gambit. A versatile opening which immediatly questions the center and allows for solid development.} dxc4 {The queen gambit accepted. I'll be honest here, I wasn't expecting this. The queen gambit is a gambit which most people just refute since the queen gambit declined lines, allow a variaty of solid positions for black. The QGA at the other hand sometimes leads to wild tactical battles, the reverse of the QGD.} 4. Nc3 {I could play e3 immediatly or Qa4+ if I really cared that much about the pawn. That being said, theory shows that the pawn on c4 is really difficult to hang on to if white plays it correctly. I don't think I'm amazing at chess, but I'd say I'm good enough to win back the pawn at a later occasion.} Nf6 5. e4 {e4 is a choice of preference. I used to play e3, which is a different variation on itself, but found to have more succes with e4. It's slightly more dangerous, but quickly seizes the initiative. Plant a knight on e5, recapture the lost pawn with the bishop, and all kind of sacrifices come to mind. The usual response of black here is either Bb4 or c5. I'm not 100% certain, but I think c5 is better. After that the QGA gets divided into 2 sidelines. The one where white captures on c5 or the one where black captures on d4.} h6 {I don't really like this move. Yes it stops Bg5, however black can always play Be7 defending the knight and then later on chase away the bishop. The fact that c5 or Bb4 wasn't played indicate that my opponent isn't too familiar with this opening.} 6. Bf4 {I decide to play my bishop on f4 instead, targeting the rather weak c7 pawn. Be3 was also a possiblity, but this feels sligtly stronger. I'm not too scared of g5 since it completely destroys his king side pawn structure. The computer would probably recommend Bxc4 first, but I don't think it matters too much. } Nc6 {This seems okay at first, but it makes things troublesome for black since c5 is no longer a possibility. It's going to be hard after this to make a break and force my center wide open.} 7. a3 {Preventing Bb4. This might be unnecessary, but I felt like I had a tempo to spare. It makes it so that his bishop can't really go anywhere aside from Be7, which isn't a lot to be scared of. Bb4 and Bc5 aren't an option and Bd3 gets met with e5, forking the knight and the bishop.} a6 {I can sort of understand why he played this, but it feels kind of iffy. Bxf4 b5 and my bishop has to retreat, but that's not really something I'd mind.} 8. Bxc4 Be7 9. O-O {I didn't want to castle, but I can't remember the last time when I was fully developed before move 15. I decided to make it a priority before I tried any serious attacking.} b5 {We knew it was coming. I can simply retreat it, though I'm a little concerned of 10. Ba2 b4. Yes it opens the diagonal for my rook, but it gets his inactive black bishop back into the game.} 10. Ba2 {I'm not too certain, but I believe it was fisher who liked his bishops like this. I think it's well placed and it protects the c4 square on which he could potentially place his knight. after Nc6->Na5->Nc4.} Bb7 {Things get a little tricky from here on out.} 11. Rc1 {The idea is simple, but effective. Chase the knight away on c6 and target c7.} Na7 {I spend about 20 minutes on my next move since I was a tad confused. I start calculating Nd5 ideas, but quickly find that it's not worth it. It took me about 15 minutes to  even realize that e4 was being targeted by the bishop and that ideas like 12. h3 b4 13. axb4 Bb4 are rather annoying since the knight on c3 is the only defending piece of e4. My other knight can't help out either since it'd give away the pawn on d4.} 12. Re1 {Fully developed in 12 moves, it's a miracle. To give you an insight on how rare that is for me. If I showed this game to my fellow chess players/tutors they would refuse to believe I was the one playing this game, just because of the developing aspect. That being said, it's time to punish him a bit now that e4 is taken care of.} c6 {This move looks like it completely loses. But believe it or not, but this move is recommended by the computer for reasons I don't understand just yet. The computer probably says this is correct because after 13 moves black somehow equalizes, but we're not magnus carlsen, playing 13 moves correctly is far too much of a stretch at this elo. I guess he didn't want to risk losing it, but it takes both his knight and bishop out of the game. The next few moves will take me a very long time since I was determined to reach a won position before he was able to relocate his pieces.} 13. Qd2 {This move is a question mark in my opinion. It's probably not the best move, but it was played to prevent him castling. If he castles, I'd sacrifice my bishop, get my knight involved, maybe sacrifice the knight as well, involve my white bishop, etc. It'd be a lot of calculations, but in the variations that I ran in my head, it was game over for black. Either way the entire sequence would most likely be forced. I'm pretty sure black has a way out of it, but I'd calculate that way before I even attempted a sacrifice of course.} Nh5 {He took quite long to reach this move. I guess he was calculating what'd happen if he were to castle and didn't like what he found. Nh5 isn't too bad to be honest. My bishop is strong, his knight isn't.} 14. Ne5 {I have my doubts about this move, it's the type of move that looks good on paper, but you get your doubts after it's played. The idea is simple. He takes my bishop, I recapture and threaten mate in 1, he plays f6 and my knight becomes a monster knight on g6. That being said, I missed that Bf6 is also a defence, but it leads into a temporary knight sacrifice. He could also castle but that would get met with the same knight sacrifice.} Nxf4 15. Qxf4 Bf6 16. Nxf7 {I figured I was going to win at least one pawn here, but in all actuality it's not as impressive as it looks. Black can hold if he plays correctly.} Kxf7 {The correct response, all other variations lose material.} 17. e5 {Black has 3 options here. g5 after which I play Qf3, Qc7 or sort of ignoring it.. My gut feeling says ignoring it is correct. Qc7 is good, but it leads into 17. e5 Qc7 18. Bxe6+ Kxe6 19. exf6+ and black loses his queen. g5 just weakens the queenside and doesn't really solve it.} Re8 {Centralising the rooks, not bad.} 18. exf6 Qxf6 19. Qxf6+ gxf6 {I could have avoided trading queens and I'm pretty sure Ne4 was more correct. however I felt like my pressure on e6 would win me a pawn eventually and get me into a comfortable endgame.} 20. Ne4 {The plan is to get my knight on c5, putting pressure on e6 and threatening the bishop.} Rad8 {Targeting the d4 pawn, a pawn which I'd rather not lose. since it stops c5, which would potentially allow his bishop and knight back into the game.} 21. Nc5 {I don't want to lose d4, but it's worth it if it means winning the e6 pawn and infiltrating his territory. This knight also stops c5 from being played. I'm pretty sure this is about as good as a knight can get.} Bc8 22. Rcd1 {I can't capture e6 and the d4 pawn is still being targeted. I'll defend it for the time being.} f5 {He's trying to prevent me from involving my f-h pawn which haven't moved the entire game. I was planning to get to that next move, but I guess plans will have to change temporarily.} 23. Re3 {Ideas of maybe targeting the h6 pawn cross my mind and I decide to play Re3. I could also potentially double the rooks on the e-file if I find an opportunity to do so without losing my d pawn.} Kf6 24. f4 {Preventing the black king of coming to g5, but making the 4th rank more vulnerable in the process. As you might have guessed end games are my weakness. I can't play 'em for the life of me so I have no idea wether or not this was a stupid decision or not.} a5 {Followed by b4, poking that pawn island a little. I could see it coming from miles away, but didn't care enough.} 25. Kf2 {The plan is simple. Get my king all the way to d3, freeing my rook on d1 to go fulfil some greater plan.} Rd6 {He probably wanted to double the rooks. I got other plans though.} 26. g4 {He can't capture because Ne4+ follows which wins material. Ignoring it, however, can get a little awkward.} fxg4 {Mistakes were made. The snowballing starts from here and then in the end I'll blunder about 5 times or more. Heh, happens to the best of us I guess.} 27. Ne4+ Ke7 28. Nxd6 Kxd6 {Materialistically speaking I'm only slightly ahead. But the pawn on g4 is rather weak, the pawn on e6 is a mess and his knight is having a summer holiday on Miami beach, being non-existent and all. The score is +1, but positionally speaking this might even be something like +3. I'd check if I cared enough to download stockfish or something similar.} 29. Kg3 {Targeting g4. Either he plays h5 or he drops his protection of the e6 pawn.} c5 30. dxc5+ {Taking g4 gets met by a check, I couldn't be bothered to calculate all of it since I'll win it sooner or later anyway.} Kxc5 {His king can only move backwards from here. I consider Rc1+ for a little, but wanted to try something else first.} 31. f5 {He can't capture it since his rook is hanging. Ignoring it isn't great either so he plays the obvious move.} e5 {As you can see White's looking pretty comfortable. Don't worry though, I promise you that I'll make the game a tad more exciting, because you know. I totally blundered on purpose. ( *cough* lies *cough cough* )} 32. Kxg4 Rg8+ 33. Kf3 {I'm dumb. Like really really dumb. Bxg8 means black might as well resign. It was the 5th hour of sitting behind a chessboard. My mind was tired and I missed it. This blunder however is me just missing something. The other blunders are me just losing material.} Rg5 {Attacking f5, reasonable enough.} 34. Rxe5+ {Defending f5 and gobbling up a pawn.} Kb6 35. Rd6+ Kc7 36. Rxh6 {I can't help but feel that this was a mistake. I think Rg6 was better, trying to force a trade.} Nc6 {This move is going to be my downfall. He tempts me to win a pawn and it'd fall to Nd4+, forking king and rook. I spend about 15 minutes thinking out the entire endgame, then end up making one of the few moves which loses. I feel like I deserve an award for that accomplishment. I feel like Rc5 just wins the entire game, but I missed it.} 37. Kf4 Nxe5 {I wasn't worried just yet, since I didn't realize he has a nasty check on f7 as well. I consider Be6 for a moment, but it doesn't work. } 38. Kxg5 {I think Kxe5 might have been better. I'm still 2 pawns up after all, though he'd win back the pawn on f5 and promoting my h pawn would be terribly difficult. He'd put me in check about a kazillion times and somewhere along the lines I'd lose another pawn. } Nf7+ 39. Kg6 Nxh6 40. Kxh6 Bxf5 {At this point I have to re-evaluate the position. From this point onwards I make about 1 more minor blunder, namely failing to promote which I could have if I wasn't playing like a guy who was having a stroke. Back to the present, I can see the path to promoting the pawn. If I can get my king on g7, my bishop on g6 and my pawn on h5 or h6 then it's my win. However making it that far takes time and I'm getting difficulty to calculate how much tempi he needs to promote versus how much I need. I opt to deal with the a and b pawn first, then sprint back to my h-file. The endgame plan is to get my king on e3, holding back his king, play my bishop to f7 and go from there.} 41. Kg5 {Getting a tempo, making it easier to get to e3.} Bh7 {I messed up 1 or 2 moves of my notation here. But this is more or less what it came down to.} 42. h4 Kc6 43. Kf4 Kc5 44. Ke3 a4 {He's going to try something, but it doesn't matter much. I figured I'd be quicker.} 45. Bf7 b4 46. axb4+ Kxb4 {As sketchy as this looks, he can't actually approach my pawn with his king due to my bishop on f7. If he wants my pawn he'll have to trade for it.} 47. h5 {Everything is in position.} a3 48. bxa3+ Kxa3 49. Kf4 Kb4 50. Ke5 Kc5 51. Kf6 Kd6 {Theoretically a won endgame. But that wouldn't be any fun eh?} 52. h6 {Simply playing Bg6 wins too after 52.Bg6 Bg8 53.Kg7 Bb3 54. h6 and white will promote the pawn.} Kd7 53. Kg7 {Once again, Bf6 just wins. I miscalculated it. I figured Bg6 Bxg6 Kxg6 Ke8 is a draw, but that is of course not the case.} Ke7 54. Bg8 {Trying for a little trick, if he captures I win. Kxh7 doesn't work since he simply captures my bishop and my king will be stuck on h7 and h8, thus making promotion impossible.} Bd3 {After an 8 minute think we shake hands. It's a draw. His teammates literally shouted: mate you got so lucky!  Afterwards they congratulated me for a game well played, I didn't end up winning but they weren't expecting a player without rating outplaying a near 1700 elo player, let alone nearly winning the whole thing. I left with mixed feelings. I was euphoric that I played so well the first 20-30 moves, but the fact that I threw away one of the easiest wins of my short chesscareer left a bitter aftertaste. At the very least it shows me that I need to work on my endurance and on endgames so that I prevent missing simple patterns. The season might be over, but practicing isn't. I'll be improving my game during the summer holidays. }
