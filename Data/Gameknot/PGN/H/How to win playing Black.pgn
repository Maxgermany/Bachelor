1. e4 e5 {e4 e5 nothing yet in blunders so far!} 2. a3 {?I am seeing this move more and more!  Usually after development of at least a couple knights.} Nc6 { Black is developing,putting the knight out for protection of e5 pawn} 3. b4 {White has yet to developed any pieces besides pawns} Nh6 {black develops a second knight on h6 instead of f6.} 4. c3 {white still developing with pawns only.} d5 {black develops pawn in center to d5 with attack on the center, backed up with queen.} 5. Bb5 {white brings out first developed piece to pin the knight on c6.} Bg4 {with protection of knight on h6, black moves LSB  to g4 and threatens whites queen.} 6. f3 {white blocks with a simple pawn to f3.} Bh5 {Black retreats LSB to h5} 7. g4 {white trys to force away the LSB with another pawn to g4.} Qh4+ {Black puts white in check with queen to h4.} 8. Ke2 {Only way to get out of check is to move king.} d4 {Black continues moving his d pawn up the center. It is protected by pawn on e5. Remember the knight on c6 is pinned.} 9. Bxc6+ {?White takes the Knight with LSB and puts black in check. This is a weak move, this is whites only developed piece and now is trading with the knight?} bxc6 {pawn takes LSB.} 10. Qa4 {White queen now on attack looking at pawn on c2 which is now pinned down.} Rd8 {rook slides to d8 next to his king for protection from the lone queen attack by white. This move will save the rook from a fork if queen attacks c6 pawn for a check.} 11. Qxc6+ {queen takes pawn and puts king in check. } Rd7 {rook blocks check and protects pawn on c7.} 12. gxh5 {white pawn takes LSB. } d3+ {?d pawn checks king and is not protected by the pinned rook on d7. } 13. Kd1 {?white king retreats to d1. But look at the power of the pawn on d3!  white king should of taken this pawn.} Qf2 {queen moves to 2nd file on f2 and is going to end this game soon.} 14. Qb5 {? queen moves to b5. A better move would of been moving Bishop to g3.} Qf1# {Queen to f1  check mate! I didn't know this game was filled with so many blunders! End result is Black won!}
