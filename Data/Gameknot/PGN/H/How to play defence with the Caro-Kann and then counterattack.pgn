[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 c6 2. Nf3 {Weird second move in the Caro-Kann (?!)} d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. d4 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. Qd2 Ng4 8. Bf4 O-O 9. h3 Nf6 10. Bh6 a6 11. Bxg7 Kxg7 {Good job, White, you've managed to exchange dark-square bishops. Now what? ... Exactly! You got nothing!} 12. O-O-O b5 13. h4 h5 {Preventing the h-file from being opened} 14. Rg1 Qa5 15. Kb1 Bg4 16. Qe3 b4 17. Ne2 e6 18. Ng5 Bf5 19. Qe5 Nbd7 {Black is rock-solid. All pieces are defended. White has a weak Queenside, especially c2, which the bishop on f5 is eyeing.} 20. Qf4 Rac8 21. Rc1 Qc7 22. Qd2 a5 {Perhaps I should have sacrificed the b-pawn to open up lines for my rooks. I chose a more solid approach.} 23. b3 Ne4 24. Nxe4 Bxe4 25. g4 {Threatens gxh5 and Black can't recapture because of the pin on the g-file} hxg4 26. h5 {So White does manage to open the h-file. Perhaps here, 25. ... gxh4 26. Qg5+ Bg6 27. Rh1 Rh8 28. Nf5 Nf6 is playable. I chose a different, less risky continuation.} Nf6 27. h6+ Kh7 {Finally! Sanctuary for the Black King!} 28. Bg2 Bxg2 29. Rxg2 Ne4 30. Qe1 Nc3+ 31. Ka1 a4 32. Rxg4 a3 {Of course, not 32. ... axb3 33. cxb3 with an edge for White} 33. f4 {White obviously does not see the danger and his imminent doom. He still thinks he has an attack.} Nxe2 {Black should play Qd2 (the only move) and try to draw the game, down a piece.} 34. Qxe2 {Blind as a bat} Qc3+ {Isn't it fun playing with the Black pieces? You have to defend for 99% of the game and your attack comes in the last 1%.}
