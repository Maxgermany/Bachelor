[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 h5 {This is a bad move, but would I be able to prove it? Not necessarily. It breaks all my foreseen game scheme. } 2. Nf3 h4 {Oh, My Lord! Of course, Bg5 would be answered with... h3, "logically". :-) I won't go after the pawn, just like they say. } 3. Bf4 e6 4. e3 {d4 blocks my own action on g6. I have to go for a plan, and my plan is not "just move forward". I don't say it was good. } f6 {Why not? h5 is guarded by the rook! And it helps me. } 5. Bd3 f5 {Well, just 5 moves and no pieces developed. Fine. } 6. Nbd2 {Nc3 and I offer him an opportunity to play Bb4. I like to avoid this, since d5 is not my target. } Be7 {Here I admit that h3 would have been wise, but I wanted to tempt him to play the bishop a second time :-) Very "naive", I know. } 7. c4 g5 8. Be5 {Of course not Nf6, developing another piece (but allowing Nxg5), but...} Bf6 {Better to leave him change the bishop, if he wants. } 9. Qa4 {...and pinning the d pawn. } Bxe5 {I have no choice, since after g4 my knight has to return to g1. } 10. Nxe5 {...anyway, this knight is not so well placed, there. } g4 {Ng6 was ok, but I wanted to be more "subtle" :-(} 11. d5 {Horrible, because of Qf6!} c6 {Trying to complicate things... but it allows the deadly...} 12. d6 {Untouchable advanced pawn!} h3 13. g3 {Why leave him some air? But I overlooked the simple...} Qf6 14. f4 gxf3 e.p. 15. Ndxf3 {Black cannot be more cramped. } Na6 16. b4 {not allowing Nc5.} c5 17. a3 {Idem. b5 is just Nb4, threatening the bishop.} cxb4 18. axb4 b6 {Ah, but he cannot go Bb7 because of Qxd7+...} 19. c5 {Back to b8, horsie...} Nxc5 20. bxc5 bxc5 {A piece for two pawns can be ok, but it doesn't resolve the cramping. } 21. O-O {Nc6 was ok (dxN, Qxc6+, winning the rook). But why hurry?} Qh6 {And now I relaxed. Of course, not Qf4, allowing exchanges and tension-releasing, so...} 22. Kf2 {Keeping my rook duty-free.} Nf6 23. Bb5 {Overlooking... (badly)} Ng4+ {NxN, fxN, Qxg4 was good, but I didn't want to open the f file for him against my king, and blundered. } 24. Ke2 Qxe3+ {OUCH!} 25. Kd1 Nxe5 {A neat piece, and my best one. Fortunately for me, his position was so ugly, I could play...} 26. Ra3 {and no check are in sight. So I would recover my knight. } Qh6 {Only square. } 27. Nxe5 {Here I am again. } Qf6 28. Re1 Qg7 {He insists in not playing Rh7, the best way to defend d7. Now, Nc6 is playable (dxN, Qxc6+, winning the rook. But Qd4+ was in the middle. Bc6 is also possible, for the same reason, but Rb8 and I have to worry about Rb1+, so...} 29. Rc3 Rh7 {Ah, now...} 30. Rxc5 f4 {A good try (the only one!). Of course Qxf4 holds and wins, as gxf, but... could I be more brilliant?} 31. g4 f3 32. Bc6 {Rb8 would have been a good answer. Bxf3, Rb1+ but now the knight is defended by the other rook.} f2 {Defending? Never! :-)} 33. Bxa8 {So he has run out of tricks. RxB is mate. } fxe1=Q+ 34. Kxe1 {And he resigned (well, for timeout). I didn't play well, but I was lucky. And maybe somebody can see why to NOT play h5-h4 if you are not a very good player. }
