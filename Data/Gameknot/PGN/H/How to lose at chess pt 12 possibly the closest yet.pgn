1. c4 {This was a ladder challenge from someone well over 500 points north of my rating. What usually happens in these games is that I do ok for twenty to thirty moves, then I make a mistake and it all rapidly falls apart. This game was different for a number of reasons. Firstly we followed book for much longer than I normally would, secondly this is the longest game I have ever played against such a high ranked player, thirdly it turned into a bit of a ding dong battle if only in terms of material, finally a draw would normally feel like a win for me in these circumstances but this one didn't, if anything it felt like a loss.   I hope this game inspires you to not give up when playing much higher ranked players} Nf6 {English opening, in fact this is followed up to at least move 17 so I will comment no further until then except to say that I chose this as it is an opening I am fairly familiar with and it seemed to be one my opponent hadn't seen much at least in his current games when we were at this point} 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 Bg7 4. g3 O-O 5. Bg2 d6 6. O-O Nc6 7. Nc3 a6 8. Qd3 e5 9. dxe5 dxe5 10. Qxd8 Rxd8 11. Bg5 Re8 12. Rfd1 h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Nd2 Nd4 15. c5 Rb8 16. Nd5 Bd8 17. e3 Ne6 18. Ne4 {This is the first move that isn't in the gameknot database as being the English opening, the threat is the fork on f6, however this also protects the pawn c5. The only way to shift it quickly is f5 but I can't see that happening here as it would open blacks King too much} Kg7 {Prevents the fork and defends f6} 19. b4 f5 20. Nd2 {Pretty much forced nec3 for example loses material after c6} Ng5 21. e4 c6 22. Ne3 {My broad strategy now is to try to keep black as confined as I can, he has the advantage of the bishop pair but my knights are centralised and quite mobile, I also have the f file and I think I can make more use of it} Be6 {Challenging the a2 g8 diagonal } 23. exf5 {At this point I was starting to worry about blacks phalanx of pawns, my intention here was to break them up a little} gxf5 24. h4 Nf7 25. Bh3 {Threatening to gain the f5 pawn} Kf6 {My plan to keep black restricted seems to be working but I'm expecting a fight back soon} 26. Ndc4 Be7 27. Rd2 {Looking to double up on the f file in combination with my knight} Red8 {Black isn't going to allow me to double} 28. Rad1 Rxd2 29. Rxd2 Rd8 30. Bf1 {Loses material as we will see. Up to this point I felt I was holding my own and had largely managed to maintain the initiative} Rxd2 31. Nxd2 Bxa2 {And suddenly I am down a pawn, as I mentioned earlier this is usually a sign of things starting to go downhill, however having got this far I had no intention of giving up without a fight.} 32. Bc4 {Forces an exchange. My plan is to go for the weak b7 pawn to regain my lost pawn} Bxc4 33. Nexc4 Bd8 {Black spots my plan but I'm not going to make it easy} 34. Nb3 {If I can get a knight to a5 black will have a hard time keeping his b pawn} Bc7 {Makes way to bring his knight into defence of the b pawn } 35. Nba5 Bxa5 36. Nxa5 Nd8 37. f3 h5 38. Kf2 {Bring my king to the centre. I need to prevent the black King getting through the hole in the pawns at d5, d6} Ke6 39. Ke3 Kd5 40. Kd3 {So now our knights are both tied up and although I am outnumbered on the queenside blacks pawns can't easily make progress. I think it was around this point that I offered a draw. This can be high risk against such highly ranked players as it can push them into going up a gear. As he declined he clearly felt he could win. As my end game isn't great I have to be even more careful from now on} e4+ 41. fxe4+ fxe4+ {Although this gives black a passed pawn It won't be easy to promote} 42. Ke3 Ke5 43. Nc4+ Kf5 44. Nd6+ {Regains my lost pawn and conveniently defends my G3 pawn} Kg4 45. Nxe4 Ne6 46. Nf6+ {I'm expecting to lose my g and h pawns here and to gain his h pawn. My plan is to keep his King closed in on that side of the board using my King and to attack his remaining pawns with my knight } Kf5 {I don't understand this move it was certainly unexpected as it seems to lose to nxh5} 47. Nxh5 {I now have nf4 and should black exchange knights I'm confident I can promote one of my passed pawns} Kg4 48. Nf4 Ng7 49. h5 Nf5+ 50. Ke4 Nxg3+ 51. Ke5 Nf5 52. Ne6 Nh6 53. Nd8 {When black takes my h pawn I can recapture on b7 } Kxh5 54. Nxb7 {This is going to my original plan, blacks knight and King aren't in a position to defend his pawns and my knight can attack them, the question is can I promote?} Ng4+ {Expected, but this allows me to bring my King in to the attack too.} 55. Kd6 {Would kf4 or kf5 in line with my original plan be better here?} Ne3 {Black can't defend his pawns so has to attack mine} 56. Kxc6 {I now have a passed pawn and a material advantage, my optimism was rising but I have to be careful} Nc2 57. b5 {I felt this was pretty much forced, is there anything better?} Nb4+ 58. Kd6 {I think kb6 was preferable here. Around this point I realised I needed to try to prevent a draw} axb5 59. Nd8 Na6 60. c6 b4 61. Ne6 {The only way to block the black pawn is to gain tempo from check with nf4, c7 loses to nxc7} b3 62. Nf4+ Kg4 63. Nd3 Kf3 64. Kd5 Nb4+ {Very nice move from black} 65. Nxb4 {Because we can both promote this is effectively an exchange and is forced anyway} b2 66. c7 b1=Q 67. c8=Q Qxb4 {Draw agreed.   I hope you enjoyed this game and that it shows we all stand a chance regardless of rating. Please comment, particularly on the later stages of the game}
