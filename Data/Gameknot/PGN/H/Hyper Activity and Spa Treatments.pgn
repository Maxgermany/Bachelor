[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C61), Bird's defence, Paulsen variation"]

1. e4 {The King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {The King's Pawn Game.} 2. Nf3 {This is the King's Knight opening, and it is a transposition of the King's Pawn Opening.} Nc6 {He responds by bringing out his Queen's Knight to protect the e5 pawn.  } 3. Bb5 {This is the Ruy Lopez opening.  I asked Jack Stockel if this or the Guaco Piano is better, and he likes the Ruy Lopez slightly more.} Nd4 {He responds by playing a fork between my LSB and my knight on f3, but that does not bother me because I will force an exchange with 4.Nxd4, exd4.} 4. Nxd4 exd4 5. O-O {I decide to castle because this is usually my favorite move, and it is safe to do so, at this point.  } c6 {He made this move in his attempt to capture my LSB (my dominant bishop).} 6. Bd3 {Therefore, I am now forced to retreat the bishop.} d5 {He chose this candidate to fix his two weak d pawns, and that will happen when 7.exd5, Qxd5 are played.} 7. exd5 Qxd5 8. Re1+ {I wanted to take away his opportunity to castle, so I placed in check.  However, I overlooked one detail (his knight), so he will be able to castle (at some point), after he plays Ne7.} Ne7 9. Be4 {I do not want him to mate me with his queen and LSB, so I decide to move my LSB and threaten him with 10.Bxd5.} Qd6 {Therefore, he is now forced to retreat his queen.  } 10. c3 {Now, I am beginning to feel hyper, so I am trying to force an exchange with dxc3 followed by dxc3.  However, this would be ?, as it would force a queen exchange with Qxd1, followed by Rxd1.  That would result in a disadvantage, according to Jack Stockel.} Be6 {I do not know why he made this move.} 11. Qc2 {If he played dxc3, I would not be able to respond with dxc3 because of the queen exchange, as I had mentioned earlier.  Therefore, I bring out my queen to protect the c3 pawn, but I could have responded to dxc3 with bxc3.  I overlooked that feasibility.  Meanwhile, I just began to get a little hyper, and it will go down hill from here.} g6 {I do not know why he chose this candidate because I would not have been able to capture that pawn due to my LSB and his DSB (most importantly).  At this point, I take a break, due to my level of hyperness. } 12. cxd4 {Therefore, I calm down, temporarily, but I will become hyper again shortly, and it will get ugly.  In the mean time, I decide to swap his d4 pawn, but this was ? because I now have two bad d pawns, and he will be able to win back the d4 pawn.  I will explain that later. } Bg7 {I honestly thought that he would recapture with Qxd4, but he made this move, instead, to form a, "Fianchetto".} 13. Qd3 {At this point, I become rowdy again.  At the same time, I do not know why I chose this candidate. } O-O-O {??.  This was his second and most serious blunder.  I do not know why castled on the Queen's side instead of the King's side because he was not in danger of loosing.  He was actually a point ahead, but his king is now exposed.} 14. b3 {??.  I made this move so that I could form a, "Fianchetto" with 15.Bb2, but this was a serious mistake.  On the other hand, I just came back from another break but am extremely hyper and almost, "off the wall", as they say.  In addition, I am going to get more rowdy before the end of this game, and I will explain that shortly.} Bxd4 {He has won another free pawn, as a result of my blunder, on move 6.  That is because I cannot recapture his bishop with Qxd4, or he will swap my queen with Qxd4.  In addition, he is now threatening to capture my rook with Bxa1, and I cannot protect it with my DSB, in this position.  In other words, I cannot play Bb2 and form a, "Fianchetto", or he will win my DSB with Bxb2, followed by my rook with Bxa1. } 15. Nc3 {Therefore, I am now forced to protect with my knight.} Qe5 {I do not know he made that move.} 16. Bb2 {In this position, it is now safe to form the, "Fianchetto", as I had mentioned earlier, since my a1 rook is protected by the c3 knight. } Qf6 {I do not know why he chose that candidate because he does not have a mating sequence but can win a free pawn, in this position.  That is because he was going to play Qxf2+, "or so I thought", as they say.  However, it is far worse then that, and I will explain it shortly.    } 17. Rab1 {??.  Now, I am officially, "off the walls".  In addition, this is the loosing blunder because my f2 pawn is no longer protected, at this point.  Kf2 would have been even worse because he would immediately mate me with Qf2#, but I also overlooked this scenario because I was as hyper as you can get.  However, Rf2 would have been my best move as it would have protected my f2 pawn, in this position.   } Bxf2+ {He had the opportunity to put me in check, due to my last blunder, and this check is very serious for two reasons.  First, he has played a very powerful fork between my e1 rook and g1 king.  Most importantly, he will win my queen due to his rook on d8 because I cannot protect it with my queen.  That is because I am in check, so I resign.  After this game, about two hours later, I took an extremely hot shower, and it really calmed me down.  As I had mentioned earlier, a hot shower is similar to a spa treatment, and this shower was 104F, (22C).  After that, I listened to some spa music and it took away my hyperness.  Then, I went back on this site, for a short time.  The hot shower combined with the spa music helped me play well in my other league game against the same opponent.  Overall, spa treatments, hot showers, and/or spa music helps one to relax, and this can make the difference in a chess game.  }
