1. e4 {This is a return game against heart-bleeads, I lost the first game, now with white. I have to admit there is no opening I know better than the absolute standard one, so here it goes.} e5 2. Nf3 Bc5 3. Bc4 d6 4. h3 {I didn't even want him to think about going to g4 with his bishop, so I stopped him preemptively.} h6 5. Nc3 a6 {he obviously doesn't like my light figures to snoop around in his area.} 6. d4 {Let's clear some space in the center, it's getting too crowded.} exd4 7. Nxd4 Bxd4 8. Qxd4 {Bam Boom Bam and out is the queen and it even threatens the pawn on g7. Coincidence? Who knows. ;)} Qf6 {He saw it coming, and he took out the big ones. Should I, or shouldn't I exchange?} 9. Qxf6 {I should.} Nxf6 10. O-O {Let's give ourselves a little more safety.} Be6 {What? He wants to exchange more? But we just...? Hmmm...} 11. Bd5 {If you want to exchange, do it as I want, with my white pawn out of the way on the e line} Bxd5 12. exd5 {Well, that worked, the line is free, let's nag him a little with the rook.} Nbd7 13. Re1+ Kd8 {So much for your rochade - that THAT. But what now, there's so much space...} 14. a4 {To boldly go...} Re8 {Oh nooo, more exchanges? He knows about my poor end game, doesn't he?} 15. Bf4 {I say no and take out my 2nd bishop instead.} Nb6 {Now he's getting aggressive. My poor pawn on d5.} 16. Rxe8+ {So I distract him first with the rook exchange.} Kxe8 17. Rd1 {And the other goes to save the pawn.} Kd7 {He makes way for his rook.} 18. a5 {Godspeed, young pawn.} Nc4 {So he goes after my backup troops} 19. b4 Re8 {I expected that.} 20. g4 {Maaaarch!} Ne4 {Uh oh, the air is getting thin, I have this feeling.} 21. Rd4 {You cannot defend two knights with one move, right?} Nxc3 22. Rxc4 {Riiiiight.} Nxd5 {Ok, for now everything is in balance. I'm one pawn short, no big deal. But what to do now?} 23. Bg3 {I can't let my rook defend so many figures, so I take a little weight off.} Nf6 24. f4 {I know only one way.} Nd5 {Didn't you just come from here?} 25. Rd4 {Let's keep that knight on the move.} Nc3 26. Kf2 {Again, I had this feeling, so I went up with the king to be able to assist the pawns.} Re2+ {Should have seen that, but no one is hurt, right?} 27. Kf1 Rxc2 {Ouch, but...} 28. Rc4 {Hahaaa, one of you has to go - you pick.} Rc1+ {Pfff, he's just stalling.} 29. Be1 Na2 {Or so I thought. Went from a threat to a nice clean exchange. Well, what could I do?} 30. Rxc1 Nxc1 {Ok, I can definitely see an end game here, so I have to look at the pawns again, especially since I'm two short. But mine are already half way, so maybe it'll all work out.} 31. Bc3 {Uuuuh, will he see this?} g6 {Who would have though. But I see a nice place up there.} 32. Bg7 {That's a good spot for a swift bishop.} h5 {Of course.} 33. gxh5 {Let's fight. There can be only one. And I have the church with me, in form of a bishop.} gxh5 34. Kg2 {I'll just go and pick up those two black pawnies.} Nd3 {Yeah, he's gonna get one of them.} 35. Kg3 Nxb4 36. Kh4 {But now I'll feast, too.} Nd3 {Or won't I?} 37. f5 Ne5 38. Kxh5 {Now I will.} c5 {This could be a close race.} 39. h4 {But I can win.} Nc4 {This was the big mistake. Why he opened the diagonal up for my bishop while at the same time blocking his pawn, I'll never know. But thanks.} 40. Kg5 {Let's make way and go for that 2nd black pawn.} Ne5 {You like jumping back and forth, don't you? But you gave me a head start now, so let's go.} 41. h5 Ke8 {Yeah, he has to try to stop me now.} 42. h6 {But he can't with that bishop in the way.} f6+ {So he opens the way and checks me.} 43. Kxf6 {I don't think that was worth it, since he still can't go for my bishop.} Nf7 {Ummm} 44. h7 {Ok, I'll just move away from that knight, ok? I already can see now, that I'll switch my pawn with the knight, which is a sweet deal, considering it's his last figure.} c4 {No worries, the bishop will save me. Let's get active.} 45. h8=R+ Nxh8 46. Bxh8 c3 {It's getting closer...} 47. Ke6 c2 48. Bb2 {Just in time. Now it's easy.} d5 49. Kxd5 {Nice try.} Ke7 50. Ke5 {You want that pawn? Not yet.} Kf7 51. f6 {I'll just move it into the safe zone.} Kf8 52. Kd6 {Tadaaaaa. Immune.} Kf7 53. Kc7 {I'll just grab these two, ok?} c1=Q+ {Too little, too late.} 54. Bxc1 Kxf6 {Of course, but I still got one in the oven, and you can't get that.} 55. Kxb7 Ke7 56. Kxa6 Kd7 57. Kb6 Kc8 58. Bf4 Kd7 {Now the path is clear and it's just a matter of time.} 59. a6 Kc8 60. a7 Kd7 61. a8=Q Ke6 {Shouldn't be too hard.} 62. Qe4+ {Which corner will it be, black king? left or right?} Kf6 {Right it is.} 63. Qe5+ Kf7 64. Kc6 Kg6 65. Kd6 {I'll take my time.} Kf7 66. Qe6+ Kg7 67. Ke7 Kh7 68. Kf7 {Ok, time to finish him.} Kh8 69. Qh6# {That's it. Why didn't that work in the first game?}
