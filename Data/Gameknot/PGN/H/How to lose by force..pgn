1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 c5 {Ok. I don't know if this has a name or if it's just plain silly. I thought to give a pawn away to see if I could get an edge in the center.} 4. Nf3 cxd4 {ok. He refuses the pawn, so I take his d pawn. he has to take it with his knight which lets me push e5 with tempo.} 5. Nxd4 e5 6. Ndb5 Nf6 {First serious misstake. I'm in trouble already and this makes it worse.} 7. Nd6+ Kf8 8. Bc4 Qc7 9. Nxc8 Qxc4 {This is the blunder. All is lost from this point on. I should have taken the knight and the position should have been almost even, white is better but there is at least some chance for black.  [in actuality white has a forced mate from here. if you like puzzles you can try to figure it out. Its not THAT hard. Mate in 10. I added it as a puzzle. #4035]} 10. Qd6+ Kg8 11. Ne7+ {a 'meat grinder' position. } Kf8 12. Nxg6+ Kg8 13. Nxh8 {Taking that rook is a relative blunder. he has forced mate: 13. Ne7  Kf8 14. Nf5  Kg8 15. Nh6  Bxh6 16. Bxh6  Now if black doesnt cover his back rank (moving Knight or Queen) Qf1#. 16. ... Qc8 17. Qxf6 Qf8 18. Qg5  Qg7 19. Qxg7#} Nxe4 14. Nxe4 Qxe4+ 15. Be3 Qg6 {I resigned directly after making this move :-) Had I not made this error I might have survived a few more moves. maybe 15. ... Qxg2 or 15. ... Bxh8 would have let me survive beyond move 20 but not by much. That nineth move spelled disaster.}
