[Opening "Caro-Kann (B19), classical, 7...Nd7"]

1. e4 {I start with my usual} c6 {And we have a Caro-Kann for this match.} 2. d4 {So I grab the center.} d5 {and they play the main line.} 3. Nc3 {e5 is worth considering, but I prefer knights entering play over hitting 5th rank with pawns so soon.} dxe4 {So Black sparks the exchange...} 4. Nxe4 {I oblige...} Bf5 {And now Black goes for a knight chase, while opening the door to a possible attack on c2.} 5. Ng3 {I opt for reversing the attack on the bishop.} Bg6 {Black really wants to control this diagonal. Usually White wants to castle long in this varation, so the goal here seems to be to make this desire difficult by compromising the queenside.} 6. h4 {So I move to chase the bishop into the corner and even possibly allow for Rh3.} h6 {As expected, preferring a possible 7. h5 over Black playing it and meeting a confusing 7. Bg5, however this gives White plenty of options. I want that bishop out of play and to provide relief to this diagonal; the question is, when do I play Bd3?} 7. Nf3 {Out comes this knight, having a certain idea in mind.} Nf6 {Development, and making O-O a nearer possibility.} 8. Ne5 {I continue to target the bishop; meanwhile, this is an excellant square for the knight, so why not?} Bh7 {Forced into a corner. All other squares are terrible moves.} 9. Bd3 {And now, Black must lose this powerful bishop, or forever hide it from play...} Bxd3 {Likewise. Is Bg8 even worth considering?} 10. Qxd3 {No point in doubling the pawns; the knight is currently safe on e5, and this is a great square for the queen. My king is also able to castle long soon...} e6 {Black wants to harass with the other bishop now, forcing c3 after Bb4+ if I'm not careful.} 11. Bd2 {Not happening. White's development is almost complete now, and I'm ready to castle whichever direction I need to go for almost any attacking plan. But, as for Black...} Nbd7 {A good choice. The knight on e5 is very well placed at the moment, and Black wants it gone before it starts threatening anything of value. So, why didn't the bishop come out instead...?} 12. f4 {Most likely because this was going to be played next anyway. I have no intentions of castling short, so I may as well continue in storming up the kingside in the meantime.} Nxe5 {But Black absolutely wants that knight gone.} 13. fxe5 {A powerful knight swapped in for a powerful pawn. I'm perfectly fine with this, as this puts a lot of delicate pressure on the f file, and as we'll later see, Black never quite gets strong enough in this match to finally play ...f6, so this pawn actually becomes one of the key deciding factors in the outcome of this match. It certainly did a great job this game of harassing these pesky knights...} Nd5 {At first, I was surprised by this move. I was expecting to see ...Ng4, because if I were to play, say, O-O-O?? then Black immediately follows with Nf2! thusly forking the rook and queen. However, I didn't notice that the following sequence: Ng4, Qf3 h5, Nxh5 Rxh5, Qxg4 put me up a pawn to a rook that must move to somewhere awkward and forces the king to retreat to an open kingside. As for Nd5...} 14. a3 {Black really wants to disrupt the queenside by tempting c4 instead, and the knight move challenges my ability to fight for the b4 square if I don't do something about it. So instead of chasing the knight away, I play this, preventing any hopes of a back rank piece hitting that square.} Be7 {I'm not in the clear yet, though. Black has now enabled castling, and h4 is under attack regardless if the pawn is there or not! } 15. Nh5 {The only move I have that preserves my ability to castle without a material loss. g3 can now be played against Bxh4+, and after the bishop would be chased away, I play Nxg7+!, forcing the black king to move after opening the kingside up even further.} g6 {So Black decides to confuse matters by pushing out this pawn here.} 16. Nf4 {Ng7+ blunders now after Kf8, and if Nf6, then Nxf6 first, and I have to lose the powerful central pawns that I worked so hard to establish. This was far more preferable.} Nxf4 {Black seems to hate the thought of knights being on the board.} 17. Bxf4 {So I remove the last one. Interestingly enough, as open as this game WAS earlier at one point, the falling of this knight chimes the bells to ring for a closed match to begin. Within 10 moves, due to this capture, the board ends up being quite tangled and unclear for quite some time.} Bf8 {Black could have castled first, but saw that there were no good squares for this bishop on the smaller diagonal. So they decide to re-adjust their side of the board at once.} 18. O-O-O {I finally take this as a great opportunity to castle.} Qb6 {Left with nothing much better to do, Black gives the board one last once-over with a good square for the queen here. If there is going to be disruption of b4 and my queen pawns, it has to be now.} 19. c4 {As for me... I remember giving this board one very hard, long, look. I think this move took me a couple of days to conclude this as the best option for my plan. I guess I must have been very concerned about the potential of Black advancing the pawn all the way to c4 after harrassing my other pawns, and if c3, then I have wasted a move if Black wants to eventually attack the a file (since my queen is the only defender if the b pawn can be diverted away!), though I'm sure I was concerned over other things at the time.} Bg7 {I say the former of the last move because I remember being very surprised by this move. If Black is trying to target b2 with this bishop, it's going to be some time before its influence arrives there...} 20. Rhe1 {This probably wasn't necessary... but it was there in case e5 needed an extra defender.} O-O {Now that Black has finally done this, however, the board becomes a little more complicated. Notice how the key files to watch out for are especially d and e, with the desire of White winning f, and Black winning b. With this in mind, I saw that I really needed to constantly stay ready and on guard for f6, R?d8, and any queen move made by Black.} 21. Rd2 {And this was the only way I saw how to guard all threats at once.} Rad8 {d4 is under some stress now, but I am fully ready to protect it.} 22. Red1 {Now I'm in a position where Black's intentions will be indicated by any piece that moves next. As far as the central pawns are concerned, if it is clear that d4 is being targeted, both rooks will stay here. If e5 is targetted, one of them must move back.} Qa6 {Black cannot play f6, otherwise Qxg6 and the bishop is pinned to a nightmare of messes. So they move the queen, allowing for a pawn storm. What they want me to do is try to force an exchange of pawns, opening the board up to my king for the rooks and queen to take him.} 23. b4 {I decide to counter with a pawn storm of my own, preventing any possible play of ...b4! by Black, AND while allowing the queen or even a rook to continue guarding a3 from the 3rd rank, as ignoring this problem would surely prove utterly fatal for me.} b5 {Yet, Black still dares me to exchange. } 24. c5 {Yeah... no. With that move, the position is now closed, with White holding and maintaining a clear spacial advantage. The battle for center control is far from over, though.} Qb7 {Allowing the queen to be able to pressure d4, and enables ...a5! White now has some serious defense issues, and I have to find some way to have these spaced defenses to work in my favor.} 25. Rb2 {If a5 is played, b4 is now a threatened square. It must be defended right now, with the rook able to return to defending d4 from d2, if necessary.} Rd5 {(?) - In my opinion, probably the first mistake of the match, although it maintains a threat on both d4 and e5. However, in doing this, should Black need to retreat this rook at all during the match, there is only one direction where it can move to where it is needed....} 26. Qe3 {A wonderful square for the queen in this tangled web! She now protects both threatened pawns and now threatens opening the king to Bxh6!} Kh7 {The king must not allow this to happen.} 27. g4 {This move may have been premature. Its intention was to freeze the kingside in place, effectively making all pawn moves by Black at this point too dangerous to even consider...} Rfd8 {...but now I have one final problem. d4 is under attack, and the 2nd rank rook is unavailable. I am totally out of defenders to fix this problem-} 28. Kc2 {-no, wait, I am NOT! For I am the White King, and I will NOT stand idlely by while so many players forget that I am an actual piece and can contribute to this match! } Qd7 {I imagine that Black must have figured that I sealed my fate of guarding d4 at this point, now that the king completely blocks R2d2 to join the battle. However!} 29. Kc3 {...they must not have seen this saving grace from entering the fray like this...!} Ra8 {It is now very clear that the fate of Black's A pawn will determine the outcome of this match.} 30. Rb3 {So I prepare to defend a3 along with b4, at all costs.} Rd8 {And... now the game becomes tricky. If I do not find some other ground to advance upon, Black can force a draw unless I can convince them that my spacial advantage is disputable.} 31. Bg3 {This means the queen must find a new square. No longer fearing f6, I believe I was planning a later Bf2, allowing the queen possible options to advance upon the enemy king.} Qc7 {And then out of nowhere, this move appears. Is Black going to try aiming for e5 anyway...?} 32. Rb2 {I cannot lose e5, so I allow the rook to be a possible defender all around once again.} a5 {-and too soon, I think. I'm not in zugzwang at all just yet. Surely Black has better moves! Besides, I have plenty of options now that this move has appeared so suddenly.} 33. Rb3 {Dare I dream to hope that Black will play greedy instead of taking the pawn...?} a4 {And there you have it! My trap has sprung; Black has ruined all chances of wrecking my queenside as has been desired all along. Now the game will be decided on the kingside- their weaker domain.} 34. Rb2 {d4 now has three defenders out of a possible five, and it is only being attacked twice. My rook is no longer needed here, as I continue celebrating its freedom.} Qe7 {And I'm not too sure about the intentions of this move either, but I think it was to allow ...g5 to be a stronger move by Black. The motives seem a bit unclear to me.} 35. Rf2 {Now I play an attacking role, screaming down my control of f.} Rf8 {Black cannot allow f7's seizure. Its pressure must be let off of the d file for now.} 36. Rdf1 {-which now allows the other rook off the d file, further strengthing my control of the weaker column.} Kg8 {But now I have a dilemma! Black decides to employ my previous tactic of actually using the king as a defending piece. The problem is... it works! The nature of this closed position, as the board stands, Black can have just as many defenders as I can have attackers on the f7 pawn! I need a new plan!} 37. Rf2f3 {I need to start untangling this web. Perhaps the order of which pieces stack where (Queen at bottom) can help me sort this out?} Qb7 {Black pulls the queen away... err... for some reason?} 38. Bf4 {Meanwhile, I notice after the queen has fled... I can attack h6 again!} Kh7 {Nope.} 39. Qd2 {What if I can pull the bishop back?} Qc7 {Well... then Black shall attack e5 if I don't immediately fix this problem.} 40. Qc2 {Seeing the weakness on g6, I plan h5! in order to open up the path to the king.} Kg8 {And now that the pressure on h6 is off, it's not going to work.} 41. Qd2 {Maybe Black isn't going to relent?} Kh7 {Nope, and they're certainly wise to persist. They know now that the draw must be forced upon me.} 42. Qd3 {I try again.} Kg8 {Nope. Not happening.} 43. Rf1f2 {I needed to think up new ideas. If I kept persisting, the only thing I'd get is threefold repetition.} Qa7 {Black is clearly waiting for me to decide on a new strategy, but stronger is Qe7. With the bishop oddly misplaced, I don't have a way of preventing Qxh4 without retreating.} 44. Qf1 {-But should that be Black's plan, I'll be ready to launch a full assault on f7; I finally sat myself down and saw a working plan to blast open the kingside! Now my attack is ready for action. Meanwhile, though, I'm pretty sure that given the next set of moves, Black had other thoughts in their mind...} Qb7 {(Just give up and accept my draw offer!)} 45. Qc1 {What's this? Have I finally considered accepting the draw?} Kh7 {(Well, then surely this charade will continue until I can queue the game for threefold rep...)} 46. Be3 {I finally place the bishop in the right square, now that the Qe7 threat is no longer viable.} Qc7 {(Ha! It's almost as though White thinks they can break my defenses! Just go ahead and try!)} 47. h5 {(Wait... what? Do they not obviously see that I do not have to accept this exchange?!)} g5 {(MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Your game is over!)} 48. Bxg5 {-Not so fast, my dear friend! Now that the queen does not occupy e7, THIS can be played! Those pesky pawns are worth so much more than the bishop at this point... and the king is now exposed to the wind!} hxg5 {Rd7 here (incidentally should have been played a LONG time ago) might have been better, although, I did have g6+ as an alternative.} 49. Qxg5 {Well hello there, Black! Nice to see you this up close and personal!} Bh6 {What few squares this bishop still has are good ones for it, however...} 50. Qf6 {It cannot save the king. There are too many squares I can threaten at this point.} Bg7 {Black drives the queen off of the 6th rank anyway.} 51. Qf4 {It doesn't matter. A kingside pawn storm will prove this match to be mine.} Qe7 {Futile.} 52. g5 {That f pawn is going to fall any moment now. The king must move or meet its fate to my rooks if it dares allow itself to be checked.} Kg8 {It doesn't, so now I can play...} 53. h6 {Back into your corner!} Bh8 {And yet, it remains to be a good, if not utterly confined square for this piece.} 54. Rg2 {So to be doubly sure of things, I play this, removing all hopes of the capture of either pawn.} Rd7 {And finally Black plays this move, in a desperate attempt to spare f7.} 55. Rh3 {Unfortunately, I no longer need that attack. Now h7+ is viable.} f5 {A desperate move to give the king a flight square, or else I'd have mate.} 56. gxf6 e.p.+ {And there you have it. If I'm not wrong, Black's king can actually escape mate via Kf7 and then run off to e8, but the queen would be lost in the process of doing so. In face of such dire circumstances, Black resigns here, thus resolving this greatly satisfying battle of such a contested center. This was easily one of the most fun and puzzling matches I've had in some time; thank you for reading this annotation! :)}
