1. c4 {This was definitely a game of two halves as they say. It all started reasonably well then after around 20 moves everything fell apart. I think I learnt a lot from this game but would still be interested to see comments and thoughts.  Analysis is also available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18461988&rnd=0.7610093399416655} Nf6 {English, 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian defense) (A15), I'm not sure why but this isn't a response I see often to my favoured c4 opening} 2. Nc3 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. d4 O-O 6. Be2 c5 {This is quite a common choice but I think I prefer e5 here for black} 7. O-O Na6 {While its still well within the Gameknot opening database I don't really understand this move. The computer calls it an innacuracy} 8. a3 {This was to prevent a knight incursion on b4 but the computer calls it a mistake preferring e5} cxd4 9. Nxd4 Nc5 10. f3 a5 11. b3 {This move seems very passive to me I'm still not entirely sure why i made it.} Ra6 {This was a bit unexpected I'm not sure where the rook is headed} 12. Be3 Bd7 13. b4 {Now my a1 rook is defended I can safely do this but I don't think its best as it allows black to exchange off his a rook which looks awkward to me} axb4 14. axb4 Rxa1 15. Qxa1 Ne6 16. Rd1 Qc7 17. Ndb5 {Trying to push the black queen out of harms way} Qb8 18. Qb1 {This is another move that I think especially with the benefit of hindsight is too passive} Rc8 19. Qd3 b6 20. Nd5 Nxd5 21. Qxd5 {I thought long and hard about this and decided to take with the queen so as not disrupt my pawn structure too much, in particular I didn't want to open the c rank for black. As it turns out this was the start of my demise.  Analysis calls this an inaccuracy} Be5 22. Bh6 {This didn't seem unreasonable at the time, the bishop is pretty safe there and keeps the black king hemmed in, I just need to work out how to get at it however analysis calls this a mistake preferring g3} Bxb5 23. Qxb5 {For some reason I completely missed the threatened fork here. I took with the queen to avoid doubled pawns and to keep the c rank closed.  Analysis calls this a mistake and gives black a large advantage from this point.} Nd4 24. Qd7 {I saw this as an attempt to cut my losses but at this point I started to lose my way, the computer prefers Rxd4, from now on I fall into my opponents hands completely.} Nxe2+ 25. Kh1 Rc7 26. Qg4 Nc3 27. Rf1 Rxc4 28. Re1 Rxb4 29. f4 Nxe4 30. Qf3 Bc3 31. Rd1 d5 32. g3 {Thanks for reading please comment} Rb2 33. Rxd5 Qa8 {}
