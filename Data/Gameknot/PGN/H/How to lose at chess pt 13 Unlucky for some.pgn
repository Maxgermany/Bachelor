1. e4 {At the time this game started I was in the midst of a slump in form. To add insult to injury I had a few challenges from much higher ranked players on the slow ladder. This is one of those games  Annotation is available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=26566808&rnd=0.06266435291659667 } e5 2. f4 {Clearly it would be suicidal to play an opening I'm not familiar with so I start with Kings Gambit which is the one I was most familiar with at the time. I was also hoping my opponent wasn't too familiar with it.} exf4 {Gambit accepted} 3. Nf3 g5 4. Nc3 d6 5. Bc4 g4 6. Nd4 Qh4+ 7. Kf1 g3 {The computer analysis calls this a mistake and prefers  Ne7 8. d3 Bh6 9. Qe1 Qxe1+ 10. Kxe1 a6 } 8. Nf3 {The analysis likes this. For the first time in the game my score goes positive} Qh5 9. d4 {threatens to regain the pawn that was gambitted} Bg4 10. Bxf4 gxh2 {pretty much forced as black won't want to be a pawn down} 11. Bxh2 {Computer calls this a mistake, preferring Rxh2 ... my intention here really was to simply defend the bishop } d5 {This was completely unexpected, I can't see here what black was attempting to do. I was expecting black to develop a piece} 12. Nxd5 {I'm not going to refuse a free pawn especially one that threatens a fork with king and rook. The analysis now puts white firmly in the lead. Looking at the position black seems underdeveloped to me so I'm going to try to take advantage, initially be denying black the ability to castle.} Bd6 13. e5 c6 14. Nf4 Bxf3 15. Nxh5 {The analysis prefers gxf3 but I was happy to exchange queens as it reduces blacks active pieces and allows me to achieve my short term objective of forcing the black king to move - losing the ability to castle.} Bxd1 16. Rxd1 Be7 17. Ng7+ Kf8 {pretty much forced otherwise black will lose a pawn} 18. Nf5 {I like this move as blacks kingside knight and rook are pretty much trapped in and the king is restricted to the 8th rank. Not only that, but blacks knight on b8 can only really move to d7 which leads nowhere at the moment.  Tempting as it is I'm not going to take blacks bishop as that will free up his kingside pieces. Its seems to me that the best thing I can do is take advantage of my space advantage to restrict the options for black.} b5 19. Bb3 a5 20. a4 {I suspect black is trying to get something going here but I'm not moving my lsb off this diagonal} Na6 21. c3 {firming up my pawn chain and preventing Nb4 should he be considering it} Nc7 22. Bf4 {Considering forcing an exchange of knights followed up with Bh6} Nd5 23. Bc1 {I'd like to keep my bishops though I did consider g3 would give me a very nice pawn chain if he took ie 23. g3, Nxf4, 24. gxf4   I also need to be wary of the fork on e3 although it's well defended at the moment.} Rb8 24. axb5 {Isolates his pawns as cxb5 loses to Bxd5} Rxb5 25. Ba4 Rb6 {forced.   blacks rook on b6 now looks rather uncomfortable} 26. g3 {this was intended to prevent Nf4 as I'm going to try to move the knight with c4. I'm still not sure if g4 would have been better} f6 27. c4 Nb4 28. e6 c5 {the analysis calls this as mistake, I call it a suprise as I wasn't expecting this even though blacks options are limited} 29. d5 {No way would I have exchanged pawns, I think that would have been a mistake. This move gives me connected passed pawns. As long as I can keep them connected I think I am in with a chance here, blacks position is still looking cramped to me though he is trying hard to change that.} Bd6 {Analysis prefers h5 here, I was tempted to exchange with Nxd6 but I liked that the black king was trapped. } 30. Be3 {The idea here was Nxd6 Rxd6 Bxc5 forking the rook but of course black isn't going to allow that  The analysis is that this is a blunder but the explanation doesn't make much sense to me as to why it's a blunder and not an inaccuracy, white still ends up ahead} Na6 31. Bb5 Ne7 {This is a blunder due to  â€¦ Ne7 32. Bh6+ Kg8 33. Be8 Nxf5 34. Bf7# however I didn't see that. } 32. Bh6+ Kg8 33. g4 {I felt in this position black was unlikely to exchange unless he had a clear advantage  The analysis however calls this a blunder, partly I presume because of the previously noted mate.} Ng6 {The computer prefers Nc7 here however the line given still ends up +5 on material to white. I think this is where black spotted the mate if white gets his bishop to f7} 34. Be8 {This is where I spotted the mate from Bf7  The analysis gives mate in 11 however I will leave that as an exercise for the reader} Ne5 35. Re1 {The idea here was to force my way through with Rxe5 Analysis calls this a blunder and prefers its mate in 9 35. g5 Bf8 36. gxf6 Bxh6 37. Nxh6+ Kf8 38. Ba4 Ng6 39. d6 Rb7 40. e7+ Nxe7 41. dxe7+ Rxe7 42. Rd8+ Re8 43. Rxe8#} Nc7 36. Bh5 {Analysis calls this a blunder however it was intended to maintain the plan to blunt force with Rxe5} Ng6 {Of course black is going to fool that plan and here is how.} 37. Bg7 {It was around this point I decided to change tactics in favour of elimination, this bishop can gain a pawn and exchange for a rook. Given that my form had recently been on the decline I just need to be sure I don't do anything stupid and end up losing.} Nxe6 {This was totally unexpected, I was expecting Ne8, Bxh8, if Kxh8 Bxg6} 38. Rxe6 Ne7 39. Bxf6 {Continuing with my elimination plan, I can't see that black can do much to prevent it} Nxf5 {This was another unexpected move from black - not that he had many options however this opens the g file for my rook to attack the king} 40. gxf5 h6 {It's all too late for black now, even I can see a mate here} 41. Rg1+ Kf8 {Kh7 was equally hopeless due to Rg7#} 42. Re8# {I'd like to thank my opponent for this game, if it's any consolation I learnt a lot from his play and am sure I can learn even more from analysing the game further.   I was delighted with the result. Not only is this the highest ranked player I have beaten I also felt that this was more deserved than some of my other wins against higher ranked players.
