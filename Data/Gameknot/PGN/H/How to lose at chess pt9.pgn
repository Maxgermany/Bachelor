1. c4 {This was a ladder game from a significantly higher ranked player. He blundered in the middle game, which gave me some hope.  Analysis is available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=21294966&rnd=0.9512844220735133. It all starts with the English opening} Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e4 Bb4 5. a3 Bxc3 {All standard stuff so far though I was a little suprised that black gave up a bishop for a knight, he clearly thought it was a worthwhile exchange} 6. bxc3 Nxe4 7. Qc2 d5 {This move takes us out of the gameknot database.} 8. Bd3 {The computer calls this a mistake preferring 8. Be2 Nf6 9. cxd5 Qxd5 10. O-O e4} f5 {The computer also calls this a mistake preferring  … Nc5 9. Be2 dxc4 10. O-O Be6 11. a4 e4} 9. O-O O-O 10. Qb3 {The computer calls this a mistake but I like this square for my queen, it threatens the b7 pawn and is on a nice diagonal with the black king} Be6 {This was a complete suprise and the computer calls it a mistake preferring … Nc5 11. Qb5 Nxd3 12. cxd5 Nb8 13. Qxd3 e4 1} 11. Qxb7 {I figured I can't afford an opportunity to regain my lost material} Na5 12. Qb5 c6 {I was half expecting Nxc4 here} 13. Qa4 {Blunder due to 13. Qa4 Nc5 14. Qc2 e4 15. Ne5 exd3 16. Nxd3 Nxd3 17. Qxd3 dxc4 18. Qc2 Nb3 } dxc4 {Thankfully for me my opponent didn't see the same combination as the computer, this does however give me an opportunity to regain my lost pawn} 14. Bxe4 fxe4 15. Nxe5 Qd5 16. f4 Rab8 17. Qc2 Rbd8 18. Qa4 Nb3 {The compouter says nothing about this move but I think its an oversight} 19. Nxc6 {... and this is why, threatening the royal fork on e7} Nxa1 {This was a complete shock and is called a blunder by the computer} 20. Ne7+ Kh8 21. Nxd5 {I've never been this far ahead in material against such a high ranked opponent and was starting to hope I may even get a draw out of the game if I was very careful} Bxd5 22. Qxa7 Nb3 23. g3 Kg8 24. a4 Rda8 25. Qd7 Rfd8 26. Qb5 Ra5 {I want to push my passed pawn but that will prove difficult} 27. Qb6 Rda8 28. Qd6 Bf7 29. Ba3 {I can't recall why I made this move but looking at it now it seems a little pointless} Ra5a6 30. Qe7 Nxd2 31. Rd1 Re8 32. Qb7 Rxa4 33. Bc1 {My intention here was to sit my dsb on e3 but this never happened} Nf3+ 34. Kg2 Ra2+ 35. Bb2 Raa8 36. Rd7 {Hoping to gain more material but this move pretty much lost the game} Rab8 {This move pretty much sealed it for black's win, any advantage I had was now gone} 37. Rxf7 {I decided grabbing material might give me a chance still of a draw} Rxb7 38. Rxb7 e3 {Ouch. The only consolation for me was that this is the first game ever against such a high rated player where I have been ahead in material by a significant amount and when I have resigned I have been equal on material.
