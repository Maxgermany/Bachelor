1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 {This is the first notable move, avoiding all the Sicilian main lines, this is called the Chekhover Variation. I really didn't think this was good for white, and it probably wasn't, but my inaccurate moves probably cost me the game.} Nc6 {Initially, I've thought that this was my first mistake, but in actuality, I think it was my next move that was the mistake. I think that had I played 4... a6 before developing my knight to c6, my game would have been better, as in the next move I could attack the queen and gain some time to develop my other pieces.} 5. Bb5 {That's fine, he's just protecting his queen.} a6 {Here's where I think I go wrong. Yes, I'm forcing him to trade of his light squared bishop for a knight in an open game, but I am hindering my development far too much and this could have been what cost me the game.} 6. Bxc6+ bxc6 {White: Two developed pieces and controlling the center. Black: 0 developed pieces and cramped. Guess who will win.} 7. Nc3 {Further increasing his development lead. I don't like my game too much at this point. His developed pieces and central control look overwhelming.} Nf6 {Trying to get back into the game, but it seems to have been too late.} 8. Bg5 Rb8 {Trying to make him play some defensive moves in order to get my development going, but this might have been another mistake as well.} 9. e5 {Great. I can't take the pawn because I'd just end up with a queen less game with my king stuck in the center and 1 minor piece developed vs 3 minor pieces developed, a castled king, and two active rooks.} Ng8 {So I retreat, and now I have zero minor pieces developed, my rook is kind of active but my development is so far behind that it doesn't matter. He has developed all his minor pieces plus the queen, and he can now castle either side if he wants.} 10. O-O-O {He castles queenside, now his king is safe, his rook has been activated and I have 0 minor pieces developed, and the rook barely counts as a developed piece as it's not doing enough to allow me some time to develop my other pieces.} Qc7 {I thought about Qb6 for a while here, offering my queen so that whatever attack was coming could be softened, but I realized that I would have been left with a completely undeveloped kingside which would probably take too long to develop. The same thing happened anyway, only with the Queens still on the board.} 11. Rhe1 {Every one of his pieces is working towards the same goal. Central control and destroying my king. I was left with very few move options after this.} dxe5 12. Nxe5 {I was hoping for this. At least I will be up in material, even though I am far behind in development.} f6 13. Nc4 fxg5 {This was possibly a mistake, but what else could I have done here? e6 and e5 were thoughts, but I thought taking material was more important as I had missed the following move.} 14. Nd6+ {Ouch. I can't take with the queen because he'd just win my queen for a knight and a bishop and my king would still be stuck in the center and very much in danger.} Kd8 {I decide to give him my rook if he wants it.} 15. Nf7+ {He does.} Ke8 16. Nxh8 Nf6 {Still trying to develop. This is move 17!!!! I haven't developed two minor pieces yet.} 17. Qd3 {Trying to give his h8 knight an escape route. If my pieces stay the same and he goes Ng6 and I capture, I'd get mated in the next move.} Qf4+ {There might have been better moves, but I was studying and I had to move quickly. I had thought that I could develop my bishop to f5 after this, which would get me closer to full development with a tempo, even though I could have possibly lost the a pawn after Bf5. I also wanted to play Bf5 to prevent the h8 knight's escape route. I thought that if I could capture that knight for free, I could possibly have a winning game or at least a drawing game.} 18. Kb1 Bd7 {For some reason I quite don't remember, I didn't continue with the plan that I had thought of earlier.} 19. Ne4 {Threatening to destroy my defence of d7 and checkmate me.} Nd5 {Preventing checkmate.} 20. c4 {Still trying to mate me.} Qe5 {Now I threaten mate. More of a hopeful mate threat than a dangerous mate threat.} 21. Qd2 {Defends his king as he should.} Nb6 {I move my knight, but it's still defending the d7 bishop.} 22. Nd6+ {And now I lose my queen.} exd6 23. Rxe5+ dxe5 {Down three points I didn't want to give up, I still figured I had a chance if I didn't allow the h8 knight to escape. But I'm not sure it was possible to disallow that.} 24. Qe2 Bf5+ 25. Ka1 Nd7 26. Qh5+ {After this, I am in big trouble.} g6 27. Qxh7 {Don't have too many moves here, but I chose one of the worst.} Nc5 28. Qf7# {And I still hadn't finished developing.}
