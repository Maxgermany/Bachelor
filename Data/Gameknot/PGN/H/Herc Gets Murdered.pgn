[Opening "Two knights defence (C55)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {The Italian opening. It is said (by somebody to me over the internet) that this opening favors black, when black follows this move with Nf6 (the four horses defense [or something.])} Nf6 {So this is what I do.} 4. d4 {I had no idea what to do here. I have an openings problem. I think I would have been better off if I followed my own instincts instead of going with the four horses (by which I mean 2 knights defense), which probably works better for players who have studied the game more than I have?} d6 {Apparently should have gone exd4 here.} 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. O-O {Nuntar: Several mistakes here. First, 6. 0-0?! misses 6. Qxd8 , which is the reason 4... exd4 is almost obligatory. ... Yeah I was expecting him to do that too... I think. That's why I struck first.} Qxd1 7. Rxd1 Nxe4 {7... Nxe4?! is too risky; Black cannot hope to hold the extra pawn, and opening the e-file with White castled and Black not is suicidal.} 8. Bb5 Bd7 9. Bxc6 Bxc6 10. Nxe5 Bd6 11. Nxc6 {He takes my bishop forcing me to double and isolate my pawns.} bxc6 {See?} 12. Re1 {And now my knight is gone.} f5 {Lame attempt to defend. Losing me a nice castle.} 13. f3 {Now she is gone for good.} O-O-O {Maybe I should have done this earlier...eh? ... I could have castled when he first threatened the knight. Then he takes it, and I go Bf4, now I have his bishop in exchange or a checkmate on the next move. Although that is blocked by going back to Re1...I dunno. Help! ... I guess if I hadn't put my bishop there earlier I could have castled, and threatened checkmate if the rook took my knight.} 14. fxe4 Bc5+ {I think maybe I'd have had a better shot at the mate if I had just taken the damned pawn here. Then rook takes pawn back, Bc5, and then potentially easy mate...unless white goes Kf1...which would be troubling.} 15. Kh1 fxe4 16. Nc3 {Now when the bishop comes out, the rook has two guards on the king's row, making my job even more difficult.} Rhe8 17. Bg5 Rd5 {This is what killed me. Mouse slip actually. I should have asked for a take back (which you can do on yahoo) but I felt like it was going so well already I might as well go down in flames, instead of begging for mercy.} 18. Nxd5 {Game's over now, but I'll play it out anyway. Ah, the many punishments we eternal optimists will endure.} e3 {I should have took the horsie.} 19. Bxe3 Bxe3 20. Rxe3 Rxe3 21. Nxe3 {I have no idea why I went through with all those trades. What a disaster! As you can I'm dead. I resign. Actually I didn't resign. I played it out, but I can't bear to put the rest of the game down, as it's really difficult copying yahoo's chess notation onto the board.}
