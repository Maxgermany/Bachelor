1. e4 e5 {Annotating by request. Hercules_isadore asked me to annotate one of his games, so here it is. He is playing black so I am annotating from black's point of view. I picked this game as it seems to be played between two relative equals (1265 vs. 1275 ratings at the start). White begins with the Open Game.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 f6 {With 3. d4 white chooses the Scotch Game, not considered to be white's strongest options, but still very playable. Even Kasparov used it occasionally. Main lines say black should take the pawn with 3. ... exd4 since he cannot easily maintain a pawn on e5. I don't find the text move in my limited reference material. It seems to have the benefit that 3. ... d6 would have, defending the e5 pawn with a pawn, and without the drawback of allowing white to play Qxd8 after the exchanges. It does, however, rob black's king's knight of its favorite square. It also opens the lane for white to eventually play Qh5 , a move that is often devastating to black, though right now white has no way to exploit it.} 4. d5 Nb4 {The knight won't sit on b4 very long, which means it will likely have to move to a6, not a good home for a knight. Consequently, 4. ... Nce7 might have been better, though it would need to quickly move on to g6 to open up lanes for the bishop on f8 and the knight on g8.} 5. c3 Na6 {As predicted.} 6. Bxa6 bxa6 {White pounced on the black knight, though it may have been premature to do so. The knight was poorly placed and white may have been well served to let it sit there and stew on the edge of the board. And the move as played opens a file for black's rook to move to b8. Still, it doubles and isolates the two black pawns on the a-file, so it wasn't all bad.} 7. c4 c6 {7. c4 doesn't gain much, but it does open up c3 for the white knight. Black's response challenges white's center, but it allows white to isolate another black pawn.} 8. dxc6 Bb4+ {A waiting move, putting white in check, but with no meaningful follow up. White can simply play 9. Bd2 which forces black to trade bishops or lose a pawn (white is up a pawn after capturing on c6, if he is allowed to play cxd7  before black recaptures on c6, white will gain a pawn).} 9. Nc3 Qa5 {White replied carelessly, allowing black to double his pawns on the c-file with 9. ... Bxc3 , 10. bxc3. Black chooses another line, which allows white to play cxd7  (as mentioned in my previous note). A good continuation for white would be 10. cxd7  Bxd7, 11. Bd2 breaking the pin on c3 and defending against 11. ... Bxc3.} 10. cxd7+ Bxd7 {As predicted.} 11. a3 Bxc3+ {White blunders with 11. a3? - he can't even play 12. axb4 because of black's reply 12. ... Qxa1. Worse, he allows white to equalize material, then gain a pawn on c4.} 12. bxc3 Qxc3+ 13. Bd2 Qxc4 {Well played by black. He now threatens the pawn on e5 and white only has one reply that doesn't lose more material.} 14. Qe2 Qxe2+ 15. Kxe2 Ne7 {Black is now a pawn up, though with doubled pawns on the a-file, that extra pawn doesn't count for much, and white is ahead in development. The game is nearly even at his point. Black continues by developing his knight.} 16. a4 O-O 17. Bb4 Rfe8 {Black saves and unpins his knight with a single move.} 18. Rhd1 Bg4 {White seized the open d-file with a threat, black counters by pinning the white knight.} 19. h3 Bh5 {The pin on the knight isn't accomplishing much for black. The bishop was protecting the d7 square, keeping white's rook from advancing. It might have been better for black to maintain that defense with 19. ... Be6 (he would have no fear of 20. Rd6 Kf2, 21. Rxa6?? Bc4 ).} 20. g4 Bg6 {Attacking the pawn at e5.} 21. Ke3 Rab8 {Seizing the open file with an attack on white's bishop.} 22. Ba5 Rb3+ {22. Ba5 was an odd choice for white. The bishop voluntarily limits its mobility by moving to the edge of the board, and does so with no threats. 22. Bc5 looks much stronger, threatening the pawn at a7 and maintaining pressure on black's knight at e7. Black's reply puts white in check with a skewer against the white knight. White's king is now doing double duty, defending that knight and the pawn at e4.} 23. Rd3 Reb8 {23. Rd3 was practically forced for white to avoid losing material. Black doubles rooks on the b-file. Now if white plays 24. Rxb3?, black replies 24. ... Rxb3  and white must lose the knight at f3 or the pawn at e4. Note how much different white's options would be right now if his bishop were on c5 - black would not have been able to play 23. ... Reb8 without losing his knight.} 24. Rc1 Nd5+ {24. Nd5 ! deserves an exclamation point. A great move by black, putting white in check. White cannot play 25. exd4 because that allows 25. ... Rxd3 , 26. Ke2 Rxd4 and black leads by the exchange and two pawns. But white has little better. White's best might be 25. Kd2 Bxe4 26. Rxb3 Rxb3 27. Ne1 Rb2  28. Kd1 Rxf2 which only loses two pawns.} 25. Ke2 Nf4+ {Forking the white king and rook. Worse for white, his rook is already en prise by black's rook, so black is free to take the white rook without recapture. White dare not play 26. Ke3??? for 26. ... Rxd3#.} 26. Ke1 Nxd3+ {White played the 2nd worst move he had available, allowing black to fork his king and remaining rook. I have to give 26. Ke1?? two question marks.} 27. Kd2 Bxe4 {Black chooses a poor continuation. Better was the obvious 27. ... Nxc1, winning the rook outright (28. Kxc1 Rxf3, or if white saves his knight, black can save his knight too, and 28. Nxe5 is no good either thanks to 28. ... Bxe4 29. Nd7 Rd3 ).} 28. Rc3 Rb3b2+ {White saves his rook, and now black cannot gain material with 28. ... Bxf3 since he would then lose his own knight. Black finds a way to win a pawn as played, increasing his material lead and, more importantly, creating a passed pawn on the e-file.} 29. Ke3 Nxf2 30. Nd2 Bg2 {White blocked black's rook's protection of the knight on f2 and attacks black's bishop on e4. Even though black seems to have two pieces en prise, all he needs to do is save his bishop, and if white plays 31. Kxf2, black responds with 31. ... Rxd2 . One continuation I would have had to really consider here, if I had been black, would be 30. ... Nd1  31. Kxe4 Rb8b4  32. Bxb4 Rxb4  33. Kd3 Nxc3 34. Kxc3 Rxa4. While this loses a little material, it manages to leave black in an endgame where he is up by the exchange and four pawns. Better, it exchanges off everything but white's knight, leaving black essentially with King Rook 5 pawns against King Knight 2 pawns, an easy endgame to win. I don't know if I would have played it, but I would have given it a serious look.} 31. Nc4 Rc8 {Black's move, 31. ... Rc8? needs at least one question mark, and if the game were more even, it would deserve two. Black's rook on b2 is en prise. Rather than save it, he pins the attacking knight to the white rook, offering a rook exchange but evidently overlooking the fact that the white bishop on a5 defends the white rook on c3. A better way to continue would have been 31. ... Nd1  32. Kd3 Bf1  33. Ke4 Nxc3  34. Bxc3 Rc2 35. Ne3 Rxc3 36. Nxf1, winning the exchange and trading pieces, leaving black with two rooks against a knight, and still with a 6-3 pawn advantage and a passed e-pawn.} 32. Nxb2 Rxc3+ 33. Bxc3 Nxh3 {White traded two rooks for one, but gained the doomed h6 pawn as partial compensation.} 34. Nc4 Kf7 35. Nd6+ Ke6 {Bringing out the king is a good idea. The queenside pawns are stymied, so black would do well to concentrate on his 4-1 kingside pawn advantage, breaking through with multiple passed pawns, with the help of his king and support of his two pieces.} 36. Nc8 f5 {White's going to get that a7 pawn, but this was inevitable. Doubled pawns are excruciating to defend. As for 36. ... f5, it seems a little premature. Sure, it forces the pawn exchange, creating passed pawns for black on the h and g files, but it does isolate the black pawn on the e-file. It may have been stronger to play 36. ... g6 before 37. ... f5.} 37. gxf5+ Kxf5 38. Nxa7 h5 {Racing for the finish line.} 39. Nc6 Nf4 {White makes a spurious attack against e5, but evidently both players failed to observe black's bishop on g2. White's 39. Nc6? deserves at least one ?, maybe two, as white clearly cannot afford to give away one of his only two pieces that might stop all the black pawns.} 40. Bxe5 g5 {Both players still missed the fact that black's bishop is attacking white's knight. White should have played 40. Nxe5 to gain the pawn free and clear. Black defends his knight from the white bishop, a move that is not his best option (even if 40. Bxc6 were not on the board). As played, white can exchange bishop for knight and when black recaptures, the black pawns will be isolated and can no longer support each other. Of course, Bxc6 changes everything, if only someobody will see it.} 41. Bxf4 gxf4+ {As predicted. Now black's pawns are much harder to support to promotion.} 42. Kf2 Bxc6 {White gets out of check, and black finally realizes he has a free capture on the board. This is the point where white resigned, facing overwhelming material deficit (bishop and two pawns) with no way to prevent promotion (black's bishop controls both promotion squares of his two passed pawns). I don't know if this was Hercules' finest hour (in GameKnot anyway), but it's a good solid win and, for the most part, well played.}
