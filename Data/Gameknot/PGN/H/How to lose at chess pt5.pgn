1. f4 {Though this isn't technically a loss it's certainly a game I could have won and for that reason I have decided to annotate it.  This is a mini tournament game where this is the starting position} d5 2. d3 Nf6 3. Nf3 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. d4 {wastes a tempo and seems to achieve little} O-O 6. e3 {Creates a hole at e4 which is tempting for my knight} Bf5 7. h3 Nc6 8. a3 Ne4 9. g4 Nxc3 {This was primarily to open up whites position and to make castling difficult for him} 10. bxc3 Be4 11. Bg2 e6 12. g5 Qe7 {Joining the rooks} 13. O-O a5 14. Ne5 Nxe5 15. dxe5 {I think white would have been better with fxe5 as he gains control over a half open f file} Bxg2 16. Kxg2 c5 17. h4 h6 18. Rh1 {trying to tempt gxh6 Bxh6 as then whites h pawn gets in the way of his rook, notice also that his dsb has very limited scope as most of his pawns are on black squares} h5 {closing the area around the black king} 19. Qe2 c4 20. a4 Rfb8 21. Ba3 Qd7 22. Bd6 {The bishop here is an irritation but not much more. I was trying to figure out how to open up the position so I could get at whites exposed king} Rbc8 23. Rhb1 Bf8 24. Rbd1 Bxd6 25. exd6 Qxd6 26. Kg3 e5 27. Rd2 Rce8 28. Rad1 exf4+ 29. Kf3 fxe3 {I don't know what I was thinking of here, Rxe3+ is surely the move} 30. Rd2xd5 {This is no real threat} Qc6 {The rooks are now stifled and something like Rad8 will cause problems for white} 31. Kg2 {I don't understand this move at all, I was expecting something like Kg3 which would at least break the pin on the rook} Re5 32. Qf3 e2 {I would be happy to exchange queens as I am so close to promoting} 33. Rd5d8+ Rxd8 34. Rxd8+ Kg7 35. Kh3 {another unexpected move as it leaves whites queen completely exposed} Qxf3+ 36. Kh2 e1=Q {I was thinking about under promoting to a knight, with hindsight it may have been wise as this is the move that meant I couldn't win} 37. Rg8+ {A very nice move from marros guarantees him a draw due to Kh7 Rh8+ .... leading to a draw by repitition} Kxg8 {sadly for me it was only after my greed overcame me that I realised that the position was a stalemate, if only I had underpromoted. Well done to Marros.  }
