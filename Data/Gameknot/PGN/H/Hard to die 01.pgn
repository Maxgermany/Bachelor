[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 Nc6 {I consider this almost a mistake by black, because it blocks the c pawn, the black's mobile part of the game. } 4. e3 Nf6 5. h3 {To provide an escape way for my beloved dsb in h2. It's kind a waste of time. The alternative was to avoid this escape taking the Nf3 to e5. This leads to NxN, dxN, and another game. I wanted to play for this one. } Be7 {The Nc6 is a real can tap for black. Bd6 is another way to see the situation. I would have answered Ne5. } 6. Nbd2 {I don't plan c4, this is to block the black's dsb with c3. } O-O 7. g4 {This is my plan: to attack the kingside. } h6 8. Ne5 {Thematic. I give black the chance to get rid off his black knight, but I open the way for the queen to h5. } Bd6 {Too late. } 9. h4 {Now g4 is protected, and I can press the kingside. This move also avoids the symmetric queen's invasion in h4, once the Nf6 has flew.} Bxe5 10. dxe5 {Now, black can play d4 the next one, his best chance to expand. But I have a tempo (if black decides not to sac the knight for the attack).} Ne4 11. Bd3 {This also prevents d4. Now, black should go NxN, and after QxN, d4 is playable (so I should have played something else!). But without the knight, I feel my position would be defendable. } f5 {Trying to block the kingside with this well-known structure. If I take ep, exf6, his pieces suddenly get to life, and I think it was more precise...} 12. g5 {...because black cannot h5 or Qxh5. I don't exchange the knight because it would make me lose a precious tempo retiring the bishop from there. } hxg5 {Thank you black...} 13. hxg5 {...being the h column my real target. } Nxg5 14. Qh5 {Now the piece is lost, or it has to go back. } Ne4 {It goes back, sensibly. But what a tempo loss!} 15. Be2 {Instead of going like a boy after the check, I thought that it would have been more accurate to get the bishop into the fry, overlooking Qh7+, Kf7, Rg1, Rg8, Qg6+, Ke7, NxN and then is up to black to find an answer for Bg5+, taking the queen. } Nb4 {Well, black is dreaming about attacks (or free himself a little), and this just gives me a move to...} 16. O-O-O {And what about Nxf2, forking the two rooks? Don't worry: the attack I have is more than enough. } Nxf2 17. Qh7+ {Here it goes!} Kf7 18. Bh5+ {Handy, isn't it?} Ke7 19. Bg5+ {Which is better? Ok, I'm two pawns down but... who cares? But this was just an oversight: Qxg7+ and mate on the next. I miserabily failed to see it. } Kd7 {Now it's too late: the king escapes and it will become a little nightmare to catch it. } 20. Qxg7+ Kc6 21. Bxd8 {A queen is a queen. No brilliant mate on sight, sigh!} Rxd8 22. Rh4 {A way to mobilize my pieces. A rook on the queenside and I "must" get this king...} Nxd1 23. Rxb4 Nxe3 {Aha... and the mate isn't any near! This is becoming annoyant. And after all, I am only +2. The fact that black pieces are cashed in gives me the edge, but... I see free pawns coming in. } 24. c4 {I'll give him another, but I have to try to open the cage the king is in. } a5 {Very good by black. I just don't want to retire my rook, no with my advantage. } 25. cxd5+ {The position is opened. } exd5 26. Qf6+ Kc5 {Ok, I can't see the mate. Can you?} 27. Qe7+ {Kind of nice. } Kc6 28. Be8+ {I can always retire the rook. I just want to avoid it, be smarter. I'm not sure it was the right idea, because if Rb3, black can't play d4 because of Bf3+, Nd5, Rc3+, Kb5, Qc5+, and mate on the next. } Bd7 {Well... } 29. Qe6+ {Just playing with the mouse?} Kc5 {Nothing better that I found. Probably Rxb7 would have helped, but I wasn't so sure. } 30. Qe7+ {Let's try another way. } Kc6 31. Bxd7+ {Ok, let's see what happens. } Rxd7 32. Qe6+ {Black can even think about some Re6, exR, axR, but for QxN. } Kc5 {Now I do have to retire my rook, or exchange it with him. The exchange was good, but I play for fun.} 33. Rb3 {What happens now? Black still have to protect two pieces, and sure he will prefer the rook. } Rad8 {Exactly. } 34. Rxe3 {Now my advantage is so strong that I can play without... well... let's see...} d4 {Nb3+, Kb5. Can you see the mate? I can't. } 35. Qc4+ {Here it must be!} Kb6 36. Rb3+ Ka7 {Still no mate. Qc5+, b6 and... Nc4, and... } 37. Qb5 {Maybe this way. } b6 38. Nc4 {Aha, now the knight sac would be the definitive element to win. } Rd7d5 39. Qc6 Rc5 {Can you believe that? This happens to me for playing lightly. } 40. Qe6 {I was in a really delicate situation, all of a sudden, wiht all my advantage. } b5 {Interesting. No, I cannot accept that, there must be a way...} 41. Kd2 {Qe7, RxN+, and then saves the other rook. Holdable, but... wasn't I safer with this one? } bxc4 42. Ra3 {Well... not at all. } c3+ {Black is playing well, and I am shaking. } 43. bxc3 dxc3+ 44. Kc2 {I expected Rd2+, Kb3, c2... and I could have resigned (or accept the game with a new black queen on the board, trying to give it for a rook...). My queen is in a horrible position. } Rdd5 {Black make here his worst mistake, assuming the previous line was correct. Still, it is not easy to find a way to the win. I can Qxf5, Rxe5, etc...} 45. Rxc3 {Uff, I must take the pawn undoubtely. But not with his rook on a column farther from my king than the d. Now, he can easily go Rxe5, and then my queen must run and Re2+, and I have Kd3 and I am saved. If 46. Qxf5 instead, Rxe5, Qf2! pinning the other rook! } Rdxe5 46. Qd7 {No place to go to cover Re2+. I will have to lose another pawn (a2)} Red5 47. Qf7 {It's up to you, black. } Rxc3+ 48. Kxc3 {Ok, this is good for me, of course. But the situation is not as clear as before. } Rc5+ 49. Kb3 Kb6 50. Qe6+ {I will have to work a lot to get it. I couldn't imagine this was a decisive move.} c6 {Blacke thinks to close in a fortress and resist as he can, but overlooked a wonderful and unsuspected situation on the next move.} 51. Qe3 {Black is in an almost-zugwang position. } Kb5 52. a4+ {If a3, a4+. } Kb6 53. Ka3 {A waiting move, because now the black king cannot return to b5. } f4 {The only escape for black. } 54. Qxf4 Rc3+ 55. Kb2 Rc4 {Black had a blackout here, and so did I. I couldn't believe this rook was unprotected, and, with few seconds left, played the "more interesting" move. } 56. Qb8+ Kc5 57. Qa7+ {...grabbing another pawn, and with it all black's hopes. } Kb4 {Black doesn't want, but...} 58. Qb6+ Kxa4 59. Qb3# {Forced. Thank you for reading. }
