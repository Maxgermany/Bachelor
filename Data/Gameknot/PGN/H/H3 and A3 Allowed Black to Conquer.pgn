[Opening "Caro-Kann (B10), Hillbilly attack"]

1. e4 c6 2. Bc4 {Hillbilly Attack. Not recommended. } d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bb3 Nc6 5. c3 {White would be more active with d4 and a chance to play c4 later.} e5 6. h3 {I understand that a pin is not desirable, but this is not necessary. A knight on d2 and queen on c2 solves the problem.} Nf6 7. a3 {Unnecessary again. Nf3 is much more natural.} Be7 8. d3 {A passive move. Black has more space and white should be concerned about its impending constriction. } Be6 9. Nf3 Qd7 {Setting up bishop takes h3 threats.} 10. Be3 d4 {Double attack. I wanted to continue to build on my space advantage, but I exposed my bishop to an exchange. My light-squared bishop is better not exchanged. } 11. cxd4 exd4 12. Bd2 O-O 13. O-O {What I wanted.} Bxh3 {I wasn't exactly sure of the circumstances that would continue, but I knew I had enough ammunition to make it a worthy attack.} 14. Bf4 {Not so bad. Bxf7+ coupled with Ng5 might have resulted in some interesting lines. } Bg4 15. Re1 Bd6 {Exchanging a weak piece for a stronger one. } 16. Bxd6 Qxd6 17. Nbd2 Rfe8 18. Qc2 Rac8 19. Rxe8+ Rxe8 20. Re1 Rxe1+ 21. Nxe1 Bf5 {Now my focus switches from the kingside to the center, where the weak d3 pawn lies. } 22. Qd1 Ne5 {Besides attacking the d-pawn, the knight can easily provide assistance for a kingside attack. } 23. Ndf3 Bg4 24. Qd2 {A critical error that open up white's kingisde even further. } Nxf3+ 25. Nxf3 Bxf3 26. gxf3 Nh5 {Trying to produce strong threats with a knight on f4.} 27. Qe2 {Backrank mating threats.} Qg6+ 28. Kf1 Kf8 {Even though black's queen is still on the board, it can't make any viable threats against my king. } 29. Qe4 {Asking for an exchange to take out any sting in my attack.} Qxe4 {I have a pawn majority on the kingside, so why not exchange?} 30. fxe4 Nf4 {An important move to keep white at my whim.} 31. Bc2 Ke7 32. Kg1 Kf6 33. Kh2 Kg5 34. Kg3 h5 35. f3 h4+ 36. Kf2 Kh5 37. b4 g5 38. Ke1 {White should have kept its king nearer. Bb1 was better.} h3 39. Kf1 h2 {The power of the knight truly shines now. White resigns.   Lessons from the game; 1) Don't play the Hillbilly attack :) 2) Play h3 and a3 moves only if necessary. They are often misused. }
