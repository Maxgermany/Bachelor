1. d4 {This game is from a mini-tournament that I am currently in.  This is my second annotation.  I begin with d4 hoping to go into the Queen's Gambit.} Nf6 {I guess I won't be trying for the Queen's Gambit.  This is a good move, help to take control of the center before pushing any pawns.} 2. Nc3 {Preparing to push to e4.} d5 {No e4 push for me, yet.} 3. Nf3 {Move the knight to gain more ground in the center.} c6 {I think this move loses some momentum.  There are already two pieces protecting this pawn with only one of my pieces threatening.  Nc6 would have been a better move in my opinion.} 4. Bf4 {This is going to be my 'bad' bishop so I want to get it into the middle of the board and hopefully trade it later on for a more active black piece.} Nbd7 {My opponent blocks his white square bishop as well as takes away the queen's protection for d5.  The only place for Nd7 to go to become more active is b6 but the only square it can really protect from there is d5.} 5. e3 {I pushed this so I can move the white square bishop out to castle.} e6 {Trying to get the black squared bishop, the 'strong' one, more active.} 6. Bd3 {Opening up so I can castle.} Be7 {Opening up to castle but now his pieces are starting to bunch up on 7th row.} 7. O-O O-O 8. Bg5 {Trying to trade off my bad bishop.} h6 {He doesn't like the bishop there.} 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 {What I expected from that trade.} 10. e4 {Now pushing to e4 since I removed the knight from f6.} dxe4 11. Nxe4 {Now I gain some ground in the center with this move.  I have no intentions to take the bishiop.} Be7 {Retreating the bishop.  Again he has a traffic jam up on the 7th row.} 12. Re1 {Taking over the half open e file after I move the knight at e4.} Nf6 13. Ne5 {Starting to push into his territory although now I leave the d4 pawn completely exposed to the queen.} Nxe4 {I think Qxe4 would have been more productive.} 14. Rxe4 {Capturing back.} f5 {Now he is threatening the rook but he also broke apart his castle.} 15. Re1 {Full retreat, losing some momentum.} Rf6 {This move stops Nf6.  I do like my knight where it is right now, however.} 16. Re3 {Apparently I just want to move my rook around.  Again, the pawn is ripe for the taking.} Qe8 {I think this move was to be a defensive move to protect e6 from an attack.  My opponent is starting to worsen his traffic jam.} 17. Bc4 {I'm pinning the e6 pawn to his king.  I am aware of b5 which I would respond with Bb3.  That threat never comes.} Bd7 {Again, this move does not help his situation at all.  I'm thinking he is trying to bait my knight.  It is not quite ripe for the taking, yet.} 18. Qe2 {Once I move the knight, I will have 3 piece ready to attack e6 with only two protecting.} c5 {This move should have been made a long time ago.  In my opinion, the pawn should not have been at b6 to begin with.} 19. Nxd7 {Now, the attack begins.  Nxd7 which removes a defender of e4.  I am expecting QxN.} cxd4 {Threatening my rook while I'm threatening his rook would be a good idea but...} 20. Nxf6+ {NxR+.  Not only does he have to deal with no defenders for e6 but now he is down a bishop and rook for a knight.  He really should have taken the knight with the queen.} Bxf6 {The queen is now the sole defender for e6 with three pieces getting ready for the final attack.} 21. Rxe6 {He resigns at this point.  His queen is being threatened and then there is also the discovered check threat once I move the rook.  In the end, had he fought harder for the center, this game could have gone either way.}
