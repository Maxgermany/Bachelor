1. e4 {I am white and harzer is black . This game was fast paced and kept me on my heels. I never knew what to expect and really tested my skills.} c5 {English (A30), symmetrical variation} 2. Be2 { my first goal is to castle king side.} Nc6 {building up knight defense } 3. Nf3 { now ready to castle king side in my next couple of moves} Nd4 { black has other plans like get rid of my piece early on in the game. Thats fine with me . I will do the same getting rid blacks pieces early on in the game. This is when I knew that this would be a very fast paced aggressive game.} 4. Nxd4 { takes knight} cxd4 { let the games the game begin} 5. O-O {castle king side.} e5 { blocks my pawn. I knew by  if I moved c 2 to c3 . black move d4 to c3 to take my white pawn. then  I can take his pawn.} 6. c3 { getting ready for  a trade of pawns} dxc3 {pawn taking} 7. Nxc3 {took his pawn} Bb4 {puts bishop in combat mode.} 8.

Bg5 {getting ready to capture this piece later in the game.} Bxf2+ {I did not see that coming.} 12. Kh1 {safe spot} h6 {bishop doomed.

Bh5 {bishop in attacking mode} Rg8 {getting ready to go into battle.} 15. Nd2 {attack mode} d6 {not sure what was black doing here.} 16. Nf3 {sets up my trap. My knight is bait.

Bxg4 {easy capture. opsssss I did not realize that black had his rook on g8} Rxg4 {the one good thing that came out of it is that we both lost pieces.} 18.

Both times  fell for it.} 20. Qxh5 {My turn I would move my queen to h8 to get a check.} Qe3 {black has a strong attacking mode on my side of the board.} 21. Qh8+ {check.  I know black would move his king from  e8 to e7 and that gives me a chance to take his rook.} Ke7 {right on the money} 22. Qxa8 {doomed} Qxd2 {free piece} 23. Qxb7+ {check} Ke6 {safes pot} 24.
