1. e4 {The King's Pawn Play.} e5 {I am used to the King's Pawn Play.} 2. Nf3 {I transpose the King's Pawn Play into the King's Knight opening to develop minor pieces so that I am not pushing pawns, (Jack Stockel's advice.)  } Nc6 {He responds by brings out his knight on the Queens side and playing the Morphy's Defense.  I learned about the Morphy's defense from this opponent during the game.  This is, BTW, is a Knights Of Honor Chess Club game, but he and I do not know how to start a club game.  Therefore, I challenged him to this game which is why it is a, "Challenge from jkarp".} 3. Bb5 {I react by threatening his knight.  I learned, from Jack Stockel, that it is the best response in this situation, and the Game DB agrees with this.} a6 {Now, he brings out the pawn, and threatens me with axb5.  Jack Stockel has told me that one cannot take the knight with a bishop if the pawn comes out.  Otherwise, the opponent might get a, "pass pawn". } 4. Ba4 {Therefore, I must move my bishop away from danger, even though this particular move is not forced.} Nf6 {Now, he, transposes, the Morphy's Defense into the Double Knights Defense.} 5. O-O {My favorite move, when possible, is castling on the King's side, so I take advantage of the opportunity to do so.} Bd6 {I am not sure why} 6. Re1 {Because he brought out the bishop, I responded by bringing out my rook in order to put pressure on his e square. } b5 {In this position, he threatens to capture my bishop with bxa4, so I must move my bishop away from the, "Danger Zone".} 7. Bb3 {Unlike last time, this move is forced.} O-O {He also castles on the Kings side, which is more often then not, a good place to castle.} 8. c3 {He was trying to force an exchange because he was originally going Nd4 which would have caused an inevitable exchange with Nxd4 followed by exd4, but I was not about to let this happen.  Therefore, I prevented him from playing Nd4 with this pawn move.} Bb7 9. d4 {I figured that I would put more pressure on the e square by threatening him with dxe5 followed by a forced exchange, but this does not happen.} Re8 {Instead, he reacts by putting pressure on the e square with his rook.} 10. Bg5 {I decided to counter the move by pinning his knight on f6 and threatening to force an exchange, starting with Bxf6.   } Be7 {He breaks the pin by bringing his bishop back.} 11. Bd5 {I could and should have taken have taken his knight and forced an exchange with Bxf6 followed by Bxf6, but I don't.  Instead, I also threaten to capture his other knight with Bxc6, but this was a strategical blunder with one detail that I missed since I was not completely accurate in my judgement.  Therefore, it will not be an even exchange, but he will get an extra free piece, after the exchange.  In this position, I learned that one must have complete and precise judgement 100% of the time.  } Nxd5 12. Bxe7 Ndxe7 13. Qb3 {I figured that I would bring my queen out to prevent him from playing Nb4 as well as a fork between my two rooks, but I was not in a, "danger zone", in this position.  That is because it was protected by my queen on d1, so I do not know what I really accomplished with this candidate.} h6 {I think he chose that move because he was worried about getting mated in one move, but I am not sure and could be wrong.} 14. d5 {I thought that I would get something for free, if I did not capture the pawn with dxc6.  I also did not want two bad pawns on the e square, so I did not make the capture.  Instead, I threatened to capture his knight with dxc6 because I was hoping that it would lead to a captured piece.  However, this was not the case.  In fact, this was a bad choice and a serious blunder because he will now threaten to capture my queen with Nxb3.  } Na5 {Now, I must find a way to protect my queen, and it is not going to be easy.} 15. Qb4 {This saves my queen, but it also threatens to capture his knight with Qxa5. } c6 {He wants to force an exchange, and I allow him to do this because I enjoy even exchanges.  } 16. Nxe5 cxd5 17. Qd4 {In this position, I should have forced the exchange with exd5, followed by Nxd5.  Instead, I play Qd4 to protect my pawn, but I will, "rue", this choice.} dxe4 {That is because I cannot recapture his pawn because of his bishop on b7. } 18. f3 {At this point, I decide to force another exchange with exf3 but miss an important detail.} exf3 19. Nxf3 {I force an exchange with Bxf3, followed by gxf3.  } Bxf3 20. gxf3 Nec6 {Now, he threatens to capture my queen and rook, with two different pieces. } 21. Qd2 {This move protects the queen, as well as, the rook.} Nc4 {He responds by threatening my queen with Nxd2.} 22. Qf2 {By choosing this candidate, I moved my queen in the only spot that prevents him from capturing the rook and queen, for free.} Qb6 {He forces another exchange with Qxb6, followed by Nxb6 (our queens). } 23. Qxb6 Nxb6 24. Nd2 {He still threatens to capture a free rook with Rxe1, but I move my knight to prevent this from happening.  In addition, I only have two options, as to, where I move the knight.  I did not play Nb3 since I do not like to put my knight on the, "end zone" unless it is necessary which is sometimes the case.  That is because placing knights on the a or h files make them less valuable, and give them less room to escape from danger.} Na4 {Now, he threatens to play Nxb2 by capturing my knight (if possible).  Even if I do not allow him to take the free pawn, he would still threaten to capture my rook with Rxe1, so I respond by forcing an exchange with Rxe8+, followed by Rxe8.} 25. Rxe8+ Rxe8 {Although, I enjoy even exchanges, I learned an important fact about them, in this game.  Even exchanges are ok, if the player has the same amount or more material then the opponent.  However, they do not work, if the player is, "down material".  In addition, he threatens to play a fork between my king and rook with Re1+ due to the exchange.  If this happens, he will win a free rook with Rxa1, but I am not about to let that happen.} 26. Ne4 {I believed that I was forced to bring out my knight in order to stop this threat, but I misjudged.  He would not have been able to get a free rook due to the position. } d5 {At this point, he threatens to capture my knight with dxe4, so I am forced to pull my knight away from danger.} 27. Nd6 {In response, I threaten to capture his rook with Nxe8.} Re2 {Now, he wants my free pawn on b2.} 28. Rb1 {I thought that Rb1 would protect this pawn, but I was wrong because he will capture it with Rxb2.} Rxb2 29. Rxb2 {I figured that capturing his pawn with Rxb2 would address this problem immediately by exchanging the piece.  However, this was my biggest mistake because I forgot about his knight on a4, (another important detail), so there was no exchange here.  Instead, he got a free rook.} Nxb2 {That mistake forces me into resignation because he has both of his knights, six pawns, and his king, but I only have a knight, three pawns, and the king.  Therefore, he is going to get at least one pawn promotion, and there is nothing that I could do about that since it is inevitable.  This game proves that every supporting detail matters in chess, even the minor supporting points. }
