1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 d6 {The moves happened were still according to the book.} 5. c3 {This move might be to take some domination over the center and to prevent the black horse either to b4 or d4.} g6 6. Nbd2 {How about 6.d4 which threatens with 7.d5 to the pinned horse? 6.Be3 also not bad.} Bg7 {Preparation to the castling and to get rid of the annoying pin.} 7. Nf1 {Either to create pressure on d5 with 8.Ne3 or to make a defense wall with 8.Ng3.} O-O 8. Ba4 {I could not find a considerable reason for that retreat. If he needed to put it on a2-g8 diagonal, he could simply put 8.Bc4. 8.Bxc6 also seems no bad. Might be, he needed to avoid 8...a6.} Nd7 9. Ne3 Nc5 {Do two consecutive horse moves worth only to attack a bishop? If needed so, how about 8...a6 and 9...b5 which does the same? It seems pretty good than the actual.} 10. Bc2 Ne6 11. h4 Ne7 {Too many consecutive horse moves are made by black.} 12. h5 {First signs of an attack to the black king.} d5 {It was a better move if it was done before the Nf6 was moved thrice.} 13. hxg6 {Have a notice at the open h-file. Steinitz is about to launch an attack.} fxg6 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Nxd5 Qxd5 16. Bb3 {The light squared bishop is emerging a strong diagonal. In comparison, what does the Bc8 doing? It is obvious that Bc1 could be easily moved either to e3 or h6.} Qc6 17. Qe2 Bd7 {Finally, it is moved, but can you see any good squares to it? I do not think.} 18. Be3 Kh8 {Might be to take the opportunity to move the Ne6.} 19. O-O-O Rae8 {Making more power on the e-file and defending the isolated e-pawn.} 20. Qf1 a5 21. d4 {Steinitz was finding more ways to reach the black king.} exd4 22. Nxd4 Nxd4 23. Rxd4 {Is this a good move? Yes, it is. In the first look, it might be proceed as 23...Bxd4 24.Bxd4+ Rf6 25.Bxf6+ Qxf6 where the material is equal for both sides. Can you see the BEST reply there? After 23...Bxd4, it is a wonderful mate in 7. But the game was ended in 6 moves.} Bxd4 {There you see, Tchaigorin was caught. The continuation is really interesting.} 24. Rxh7+ Kxh7 {Tchaigon was forced to swap off that rook.} 25. Qh1+ Kg7 {25...Bh3 instead of 25...Kg7 would prolong the game by one more move.} 26. Bh6+ {26...Kh7 or 26...Kh8 ends the game immediately with 27.Bxf8#. Alternatively, 26.Qh6+ is also mate in 4, can you see how?} Kf6 27. Qh4+ Ke5 {Every option for this move is no longer than mate in 2.} 28. Qxd4+ Kf5 29. Qf4# {Finally, nowhere to the wandering king, CHECKMATE!!}
