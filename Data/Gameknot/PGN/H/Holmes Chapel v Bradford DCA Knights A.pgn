1. e4 {Conventional enough.} g6 {He plays the Modern.} 2. d4 {I continue classically.} Bg7 {He develops.} 3. Be3 {I develop a bishop.} c5 {Of course I can't take or b2 falls.} 4. c3 {So I defend.} cxd4 {He takes.} 5. cxd4 {I take back.} d6 {This is usual.} 6. Nc3 {I develop.} Nf6 {Threatening Nf6-g4.} 7. f3 {Which I stop.} O-O {He castles.} 8. Qd2 {This position is a little like the way I play white side of the SÃ¤misch Variation of the King's Indian Defence.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence,_S%C3%A4misch_Variation} Re8 {He avoids the exchange of bishops with Bh6, but I am not sure that this is his best.} 9. Nge2 {I develop.} Nc6 {And so does he.} 10. g4 {I start my attack.} e5 {I think this is mistimed. } 11. d5 {With the centre closed, my king is in less danger.} Ne7 {He retreats. His position is a bit cramped now.} 12. Ng3 {Bringing the knight into the attack.} Bd7 {He continues to develop.} 13. h4 {My attack continues a pace.} a6 {I think he makes a mistake in ignoring my king side play.} 14. h5 {Which trundles on.} b5 {He continues with his queen side play.} 15. hxg6 {I open the h file. If now Nxg6 then g4-g5 wins his knight.} fxg6 {So he takes this way.} 16. g5 {Now of course Nh5 just loses a pawn for him, but that is probably better than what he tried.} b4 {He tries to counter attack.} 17. gxf6 {I just take.} bxc3 {He takes. OK what would you play as white now?} 18. Qh2 {Did you spot it? No need to waste a more recapturing. I'm threatening to take on h7 and then mate him. http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=164774} h5 {He tries this. Now find white's move again!} 19. Nxh5 {Did you see it? if he takes the knight I recapture with the queen and am mating him.} Qa5 {He tries this, but now he gets mated.} 20. Nxg7 {I love the way my knight jumps into the position!} cxb2+ {He tries this.} 21. Kf2 {My king is perfectly safe here.} Kf7 {There is nothing better.} 22. Nxe8 {It is mate no matter what black plays.} Rxe8 {So he does this. OK, find the mate in 3!} 23. Qh7+ {Did you find it?} Kxf6 {This lasts one move longer than Kf8.} 24. Bg5+ {But this leads to mate!
