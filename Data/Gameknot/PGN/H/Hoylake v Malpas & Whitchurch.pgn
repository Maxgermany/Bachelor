1. d4 {So he starts conventionally} Nf6 {I play my usual} 2. Nf3 {Not as sharp as 2. c4, but perfectly playable} g6 {So I continue with my development.} 3. Bg5 {He hits my knight} Bg7 {I protect it with my Bishop} 4. Nc3 {Threatening e2-e4 maybe?} d5 {I could easily play d7-d6 with a view to transposing into the Pirc-Modern defence, but this seems better...} 5. h3 {This seems a waste of time to me} c5 {So hit the centre, or center for our American friends....} 6. Qd2 {This seems another lemon, allowing me to play....} Ne4 {Hitting the queen. I think Qf4 is best now} 7. Nxe4 {But he takes} dxe4 {I take back} 8. Nh2 {Knight moves} cxd4 {I take the pawn} 9. O-O-O {He castles} Qd5 {Hitting a2} 10. Kb1 {Protecting a2} Be6 {Hitting a2 again} 11. b3 {Protecting a2, but leaving horrible weak dark squares his king} Qc5 {Stopping c3 or e3 but Qr5 may be even stronger?} 12. Bh6 {Exchanging off my powerful Bg7} Bxh6 {So I take} 13. Qxh6 {He takes back} Nc6 {with potential attacks on the king, for instance 14. e3? Qa3 followed by Nb4} 14. g4 {As e3 is prevented, he tries to develop his bishop to g2.} f5 {Solidifying the centre, making sure his Bg2 will do nothing....} 15. Bg2 {But it goes there anyway} Nb4 {Black resigns. The position is still playable, but Ra-c8 is also in the air, ganging up on c2, and maybe e4-e3 is some variations. Thank you for reading.
