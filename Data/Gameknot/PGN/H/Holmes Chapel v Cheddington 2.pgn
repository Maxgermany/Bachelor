[Opening "Nimzo-Indian (E48), 4.e3 O-O, 5.Bd3 d5"]

1. d4 {In this game, after a level opening, I drop a pawn to a pretty combination. I fight on and manage to reach a level ending. I reach a position where they is just one move to draw. Unfortunately I don't find it, and I lose!} Nf6 {So this was playing in round 6 of the 4NCL (National Chess League), Division 3, North.} 2. c4 {and it start conventionally enough.} e6 {Likely to lead to the Queen's Indian Defence after Nf3 or the Nimzo Indian after Nc3.} 3. Nc3 {I opt for a Nimzo.} Bb4 {Which he plays, although he could have transposed into a Queen's Gambit with d5 or a Benoni with c5.} 4. e3 {I play the main line.} O-O {As does he.} 5. Bd3 {So I develop.} d5 {I'm very happy after this move, as now, if ever he doubles my c pawns with Bxc3, I can always undouble them.} 6. Nf3 {So I develop.} c5 {He continues.} 7. a3 {I now think 0-0 is more accurate, and will play 0-0 if I have this position again.} Bxc3+ {So he takes.} 8. bxc3 {I take back.} Qc7 {With a threat of taking on d4 and then on c4 and I can't recapture with the bishop.} 9. cxd5 {To meet that threat I make an exchange which I don't really want to make. I found out later that Qc2 is the usual move in this position.} exd5 {He takes back.} 10. O-O {I finally castle.} c4 {And he closes down the position for his two knights. In doing so he takes us out of the Gameknot opening databases (not that we were using them at the time of course!} 11. Be2 {So I come back.} Nc6 {He develops.} 12. Nd2 {I prepare e3-e4.} Re8 {He picks the wrong way to stop it, as this doesn't actually stop it. Bf5 was better,} 13. e4 {Now, if he plays Nxe4 14. Nxe4 Rxe4 15.	Bf3 regains the pawn. But I couldn't have played this, if he had played Bf5! last move.} dxe4 {So he takes this way instead.} 14. Nxc4 {And I take back.} Nd5 {He hits c2} 15. Qc2 {I defend.} Bd7 {He develops.} 16. Ne3 {I carry on with my plan.} Nf4 {He hits my bishop.} 17. Bb2 {I develop. This move is a mistake. What should I have played instead, and why?} Nxd4 {Did you find this?} 18. cxd4 {I take.} Qxc2 {He takes.} 19. Nxc2 {I take back.} Nxe2+ {He takes.} 20. Kh1 {Forced!} Nf4 {Aiming for d3} 21. Rab1 {Played partly with the idea of retreating the bishop to a1.} Bb5 {He hits my rook.} 22. Rfd1 {So that the rook is not attacked when the knight comes in to d3.} Ba4 {Perhaps he should have played this last move?} 23. Rd2 {I defend the knight.} Bxc2 {He takes.} 24. Rxc2 {I take back.} Rac8 {He contests the c file.} 25. Rbc1 {I double up.} Rxc2 {He takes.} 26. Rxc2 {I take back.} Nd3 {knight comes in.} 27. Bc1 {I decide that on a1, I am vulnerable to a later e4-e3 thrust.} f5 {He prepares f4} 28. g3 {Which I stop.} Nxc1 {He takes.} 29. Rxc1 {I take back.} Kf7 {King is mobilised.} 30. Kg2 {And so is mine.} Re7 {He prevents a check.} 31. Kf1 {I continue to bring my king up.} Rd7 {What is this? Is he really wanting to exchange my weak isolated d pawn for his b pawn?} 32. Ke2 {Let's see.} Rxd4 {Yes!} 33. Rc7+ {Check.} Kf6 {best square!} 34. Rxb7 {I take.} Ra4 {He attacks.} 35. Rb3 {I defend.} g5 {He tries to mobilize his king side majority.} 36. Ke3 {I centralise my king.} Ra5 {He wants to be able to play Kf6-e5.} 37. f3 {So I seek pawn exchanges.} exf3 {And get one!} 38. Kxf3 {I take back.} h5 {He mobilises his pawns.} 39. h4 {Still seeking pawn exchanges.} Ra4 {He attacks h4} 40. hxg5+ {I take} Kxg5 {He takes back.} 41. Rc3 {I am sure this is a drawn position now.} h4 {He exchanges another pawn.} 42. gxh4+ {I take} Rxh4 {Threat! Rh3.} 43. Kg2 {Stopping the threat.} Rh7 {Rook back.} 44. Rc4 {Stopping the king advance.} Re7 {Preparing Re4} 45. Ra4 {So I hit his a pawn.} Rc7 46. Kf3 Rb7 47. Ra5 {The only way he can make progress is to sacrifice his a pawn.} Rb3+ 48. Kf2 Kg4 49. Rxa7 {We now reach an ending with a total of 6 pieces, so after the game I was able to analyse this using a free  on-line chess ending database. As I suspected, it is drawn, but it is hard to draw!} Rb2+ 50. Ke3 f4+ 51. Ke4 Re2+ 52. Kd3 f3 53. Rg7+ Kf4 54. a4 Ra2 {Ok. This is the position, where there is only one move for white to draw. Without cheating and looking at your own database, find it!} 55. Ra7 {Did you find it? The move I should have played is Rf7+ which draws. (suggest you do set it up on a database and check!) I am now lost.} f2 56. Rf7+ Kg3 57. Ke3 Kg2 58. Rg7+ Kf1 59. Re7 Re2+ {The rook, and the game is lost, but it was a lost position anyway.
