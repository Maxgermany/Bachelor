1. d4 f5 {changing my habit. Normaly i whould move g6 for a "modern" defense". Let's try something like dutch one.} 2. f4 {i know this has a opening name, i dont know wicht one...this game will be funy whith this kind of openings !} e6 {dutch (i suppose, i'd never study it)} 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bd3 {the risk is d4 d5} d5 {now the risk is c2 c4} 5. Nd2 {good oportunity to cancel the c2 c4 continuation whith Bb4. Or maybe it will just postpone } Bb4 6. c3 Bd6 {now, he can move c3 c4, but it whould mean a lost  time for him while i had develop my bishop...will he do it ?} 7. Ngf3 {no, develop, prepare castle. I have a funy plan : moving my knight to e4, then he will be afraid and will take it, i take back whith my pawn and then he has to move his f3 knight. What is the interest in this ? just that then i wont be abble to castle on the king side because of my f8 rook (after castle)} O-O {first part of theplan : taking the f colon. if he doesnt castle now, he will never do it !} 8. Ne5 {funy ! it works !} Bxe5 {first dont leave this dangerous knight there} 9. fxe5 Ne4 {then go on whith plan} 10. Qh5 {ho ! surprise ! what is this BIG BAD QUEEN doing there ?? i suppose to prevent my queen to go to h4, he he he} Nc6 {waiting that he diced to take my knight : i develop. Maybe shoul i developp better the C8 bishop to d7... in order to attack the queen ...Be8   (?) } 11. Nf3 {he has seen my plan. This is not a 1200 elo's player...} Bd7 12. Bxe4 {big problme : if i take the bishop, then the knight will go on g5 and i will be in a very dangerous situation ..., so first i beat back the queen, and then i will be abble to gon on whith my little plan} Be8 {GO AWAY, BAD QUEEN !} 13. Qh4 {he he he} fxe4 {so the exchange is inevitable} 14. Qxd8 Nxd8 {better take with this knight beause he can do nothing in ths side, this action is on king side} 15. Ng5 {this bloody knight will give a hard time...no way to get rid of} h6 16. Nh3 {he will come back ...} Bb5 17. Nf4 {coming again} Kh7 {preventing Kg6} 18. b3 g5 {taking the initiative } 19. Nh3 Bd3 {nice position for my LSB, but i will be unable to leave him there} 20. Nf2 Ba6 21. Ng4 {"BLOODY KNIGHT II"} Rf7 {preventing Kf6+...Kd7...} 22. Nf6+ Kg7 {no D7 coming,} 23. Nh5+ Kg6 24. Nf6 {annoying horse} Kg7 {(i dont rember why did  i move the king there ...)} 25. g4 Nc6 {freeing the passage for the rooq} 26. a4 {preparing b4...b5 ? } Raf8 {just in case ofhe move his knight... in order to move Rf7 f1+   h1xf1 f8xf1+ ...etc. there is no mate coming with that but it could help. Of corse he can move his dear knight to h5+ and then move the knight to g3 preventing Rh7 h2} 27. b4 {is not such a problem} b5 {now i think that mabe Bc4 or d3 whould be better} 28. a5 {the treat a3 f1 is now canceled. Bad response from me } Ne7 29. Nd7 Rd8 30. Nc5 Bc8 {and now the knight is fixed !} 31. Bd2 Ng6 {my turn to bring a bloody knight to the fight !} 32. O-O-O Nh4 33. Rdf1 Nf3 34. Be1 { } Nxe1 {i hope it will give the oportunity to take back the control of the f colon...} 35. Rfxe1 {it will ! } Rdf8 {now i have my chance, } 36. Kd2 Rf7f2+ {i will try to send a rook in his camp to take some paws and do some damages} 37. Re2 Rf2f1 38. Rxf1 Rxf1 {thereis the rook in white camp ! it's risky, this is the plan : Rg1 treat the g4 paw, so he will defend it moving h2 h3, then h3 will be indefensible and i wil win it} 39. Re1 Rf2+ 40. Re2 Rf1 {one turn for nothing...} 41. Kc2 {now i can...} Rg1 {FIRST...} 42. h3 {SECOND...} Rh1 {THIRD ! i win the h paw} 43. Rg2 Rxh3 {and i'm going to win an other : e3 or g4 maybe...} 44. Nb3 Rxe3 {if he had defend e3, i would move Rg3 and win g4. then it wuold be easy to promote a queen} 45. Nd2 {bringing the knight to help} Rh3 {freeing the passage for the e4 pawn ....} 46. Kb2 a6 {strengthen this side 1 } 47. Nf1 c6 {strengthen this side 2} 48. Ng3 Bd7 {preparing to move th LSB to the king side preparing to free the h ang g way for my pawns} 49. Nh5+ {again the knight...i'm tired whith this f.... knight. If i move on h7, or g8 he will fork my kng and LSB going to f6, and anywa he will treat the LSB so i have to find the way to protect him. } Kf7 {next move i go to e7 } 50. Nf6 Ke7 51. Ng8+ Kd8 {going to safe queen side} 52. Rf2 {this was a good move for white...but this is also the bigining of the end for them  whith Rf3 !} Rf3 {if white exchange rooks, they will never be abble to stop the e4 paw after Rxf3...e4xf3} 53. Rh2 e3 {and now danger is coming} 54. Re2 Be8 {prepare to free g way} 55. Kc1 h5 56. Nf6 {or maybe freeing the h way better !...} h4 {!} 57. Kd1 h3 {now i have to pawns about to promote ! } 58.
