1. c4 {Hi everyone, I thought I would try the English Opening in an unrated game against Michaeltf - this is going to transpose into a kind of Pirc/Robatsch Defense as Michael responds with g6.} g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. e4 {4. e4 - now here is the transposition, it has turned into the Pirc/Robatsch Defense - this is when black usually responds d6 (Pirc) or g6 (Robatsch) to white's opener e4.  My next move, f4 will make this the 4 pawn or Austrian Attack.  Here white builds a fine pawn centre, but this can be very deceptive as I am about to find out.} Nf6 5. f4 O-O 6. Nf3 c5 7. d5 e6 {7. .................. e6 - black tries to make holes in white's pawn centre, he succeeds but I try and keep the pawn centre as fluid as possible, while continuing to develop my pieces.} 8. Be2 exd5 9. cxd5 Bg4 10. O-O {10. 0-0 - tucks Henry away and adds extra protection to my f3 knight.} Nbd7 11. Re1 Re8 12. h3 Bxf3 13. Bxf3 {13. Bxf3 - gets rid of black's lsb which could be annoying.  I need to complete my development which I do with my next move, Be3.} Rc8 14. Be3 b5 15. Qc2 {15. Qc2?! - I think this is where I start to go wrong, yes this move seems reasonable as it connects my rooks, and adds protection to the e4 pawn, but unfortunately Glenda is on the same file as an enemy rook.  Michael exploits this over the next few moves.  In a post match pm, Ion had this to say "There was nothing wrong, by the way, with snapping up the b-pawn at move 15.Nxb5. Black can try to exploit the WQ's conflict of interest, but it costs the exchange: 15...Qb6 16.Qd3 Nxe4 17.Bxe4 Rxe4 18.Qxe4 Qxb5. White's b-pawn is probably unsalvagable, so 19.Rad1 or 19.Qe7, putting pressure on the centre might be the way to go. Otherwise, 15.Nxb5 Qb6 16.Qd3 c4? 17.Bxb6 cxd3 18.Bxa7 looks great for White."  Hindsight is always 20/20 vision though!} b4 16. Nd1 c4 17. Qb1 {17. Qb1? - this move gives black a very strong initiative - he now adds weight to his strong queenside pawns by putting his knight on c5.  I moved Glenda to b1 in order to remove her from the c file and to maintain protection of e4 - but as you will see, this does not wash.  Here it is folks, when I am met with an attack like this I do tend to go on the defensive - it is a good habit to break and I am trying to do this, but occasionally I may slip up and this is one of them.  Michael suggested that I should have moved my knight straight to f2.} Nc5 18. Bxc5 Rxc5 {18. ........... Rxc5 - a black rook takes a dominant stance in the place of the black knight maintaining pressure on the queenside.} 19. Nf2 Qb6 20. Re2 {20. Re2 - to help protect my queenside pawns.} Nd7 21. Qc1 c3 22. bxc3 Rxc3 23. Qd1 {23. Qd1 - black's pawns are now more split than they were a few moves ago but black's initiative is strengthening because his QR is really powerful on that c file.  He now adds more fuel to the fire with Bd4.  The knight on f2 is already pinned and is no doubly attacked.  I move Henry out of the pin with Kf1.} Bd4 24. Kf1 f5 25. exf5 {25. exf5?? - this move drops at least the exchange but I did not see the combo that followed.  Alternatives anyone?} Rxe2 26. Qxe2 Re3 27. Qc4 Bxa1 28. Qc8+ Nf8 {28. ............ Nf8!! - this interposition to get out of Glenda's fork kills off any hope of counterplay.  I waved the white flag as at best I would get a pawn for the rook - no way near enough.  Incredibly I overlooked this block but I don't think it changed the result in any way as if I had moved Glenda to the back rank instead of to c4 then I would have been the exchange down in a totally passive position - so I tried to complicate things but it did not work.  So, how good is the Four Pawns attack?  You the jury decide.}
