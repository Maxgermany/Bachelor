1. e4 {Mike Stoddart had been undefeated in the Wirral League up to this point} b6 {A slightly unusual reply, although you will find it in one of my other annotations.} 2. d4 {So I grab the centre} Bb7 {He hits my e pawn} 3. Bd3 {I protect it, hoping for 3....f5 (see previous annotation)} e6 {He doesn't fall for that!} 4. Be3 {I continue to develop} Bb4+ {This is a dreaful waste of time. It is not in either opening database on Gameknot, and for good reason. It more or less forces c3 which is a move that white wants to play anyway.} 5. c3 {So I play the natural} Be7 {He retreats} 6. Nd2 {I develop} Nf6 {He develops} 7. g4 {I hit him with an aggressive thrust, hoping to drive his knight back. He avoids this, but at the cost of blocking in his Bb7} d5 {This gives his knight a square on e4, but at an enormous cost - blocking in his best placed piece on b7.} 8. e5 {So I push on} Ne4 {and he jumps in. N(f)-d7 is probably best, but still worse for black.} 9. Qc2 {I thought after making that move, that I could have improved with Nf1 threatening f3 and if he replies Ng5 I have h4 and his knight has nowhere safe to go. However later I realised that f3 can be met with Bh4+ and then Ng5 and I can't play h4. If I try to play Qc2 and 0-0-0 first, he can still play Bh4 at some point to frustrate my plans, or play c5 followed by exchanging on d5. So I don't think Nf1 is any good and what i played is probably best. I am threatening to exchange on e4 and win a pawn, so he exchanges first.} Nxd2 {He takes} 10. Bxd2 {I take} Bg5 {He seeks exchanges, as his position is cramped.} 11. f4 {I prevent that, although Nf3 or 0-0-0 may have been stronger. I was playing for the win!} Bh4+ {He throws in a check} 12. Ke2 {My king is perfectly safe here, while the centre is closed.} h6 {I was threatening to capture on h7. I end up with 3 pawns for the bishop, but the f and g pawns are already advanced.} 13. Nf3 {So I develop. He needs to retreat his bishop now, I am threatening to win it.} Nd7 {But he just develops again.} 14. Rag1 {Once again, I put my trust in development. immediate attack with g5 or f5 may have been better. I thought my threat was pretty obvious now,} Qe7 {But he didn't seem to spot it! Be7 or counter attack with c5 is probably his best bet.} 15. g5 {His bishop on h4 is in grave danger now.} hxg5 {So he takes} 16. fxg5 {I take back} O-O-O {He could have confused the issue with f5, instead he just lets me carry on my plan} 17. Rg4 {He is just losing a bishop for nothing now.} Bxg5 {So he may as well have a pawn for it.} 18. Bxg5 {Out of the three pieces which could have taken it, my bishop was the least active.} f6 {So he hits my bishop} 19. Bf4 {I retreat} g5 {He hits it again} 20. exf6 {Instead of retreating, I hit his queen.} Nxf6 {He takes back} 21. Bxg5 {I pin his knight} Qg7 {He releases the pin. I am a clear bishop up now.} 22. Bxf6 {So I may as well exchange} Qxf6 {He takes back} 23. Qd2 {I move my queen to a more active square} Rdf8 {He threatens QxNf3} 24. Qe3 {So I protect} Rh3 {He threatens it again} 25. Rg3 {I protect} Rfh8 {He is now threatening Rxg3 and I can't take back without losing my Rh1} 26. Qg5 {I offer an exchange of queens, usually a wise move if you are materially ahead.} Qf7 {So he avoids this for the time being.} 27. Rhg1 {Mobilising my last piece, and threatening to exchange on h3 and follow with Qg8+} Rh3h5 {So he retreats} 28. Qe3 {I retreat, emphasising my control of the g file} Bc6 {Try to get his dreadful bishop back into the game.} 29. Rg3g7 {So I hit his queen.} Qf6 {This drops another pawn, but the position is lost.} 30. Rg7g6 {Hitting his queen again.} Qf7 {Queen retreats} 31. h4 {I should have just taken the e pawn} Rf8 {Not quite sure why he played this} 32. Qxe6+ {So I take a pawn and force the queens off.} Qxe6+ {He takes} 33. Rxe6 {I take back} Bd7 {He hits my rook} 34. Re7 {I grab the 7th rank} Kd8 {King comes across} 35. Rgg7 {and I secure the 7th rank. With my dominance of the 7th rank, he is losing his c pawn, unless he plays Re8 forcing further exchanges. He resigned here.
