[Opening "Van't Kruijs opening (A00)"]

1. e3 {White decides to contrast with the movie and open with e3. I rarely see skilled players attempting this opening, so of course I got a little nervous from the beginning.} d5 {So I open the GK database and start analysing options I was comfortable with, starting here...} 2. d4 {Transposing into a queenside opening. I usually see varations of this in QGD.} Nf6 {So I decide to pull out Ron! And mostly just stick him there for most of that match.} 3. Nc3 {White decides to contest d5-e4, rather than throw off the d5 pawn with c4 as per QG.} Bf5 {I plan e6 anyway, so I may as well not block in the LSB.} 4. Nf3 {More development.} e6 {I continue with my plan.} 5. a3 {White decides Harry Potter is too much of an annoying kid to bother the king on b4. Probably true.} c5 {And I fully transpose into my usual QGD play, since I'm most familiar with it on this type of board.} 6. dxc5 {White accepts the Gambit.} Bxc5 {Expeliarmus!} 7. b4 {No using Magic on mere Muggles!} Bd6 {Run away Harry!} 8. Bb5+ {? - Not sure about the check. I preferred Be2...} Nbd7 {Now, if the bishop takes here, I can decide who captures back later, as opposed to Nc6 where if Bxc6+, the only move is bxc6.} 9. O-O {White decides to take a break and move the kings away from danger.} O-O {I oblige, freeing the pin on my knight.} 10. Nd4 {My assumption was that White felt as though my LSB was actually doing anything at all. Or maybe Bg4 was actually a real threat. I couldn't see how.} Bg6 {But I retreat the bishop here anyway, interested in seeing what White was planning.} 11. Bxd7 {? - Another questionable White LSB move. The knight on d7 was hindering, if anything.} Qxd7 {Now my Queen finds an active square where she can defend the entire d file. Bd6 is now safe.} 12. Re1 {White probably decided to see what I was planning, also dreaming of pushing e4 soon.} a6 {I was more concerned about White's control of b5. But there was probably a stronger move.} 13. Nf3 {...Maybe. Perhaps Qc7 or e5 had White's attention, both on their own are strong moves, but not if they were played together, and the knight always had a flight square either way. Also, if e5, I block the bishop attack on h2, and d5 is exposed to White's Queen, so I couldn't see the concern here.} Rac8 {I notice how weak White's defenses were along this file, so out comes Hermione.} 14. Ne2 {!? - Why not move the bishop first? d4 is protected, and I can't play Be5, or else Nxe5...} Bxc2 {So I accept my pawn and hit the Queen.} 15. Qd2 {Practically forced.} Qc7 {I emphasize my control of both the c file and the b8-h2 diagonal.} 16. Ra2 {White is not having any of this. However, this is a moot point...} Be4 {...because Black was already planning on bullying the knight, and Rc2 is too far away anyway.} 17. Nf4 {White decides to off the 11-year old wizard's path to the king once again.} e5 {I know I could have exchanged here, and maybe I should have given what happens later. But I figured that f4 was a fine square for this knight, so I try pushing it to a different square.} 18. Nh3 {As I had hoped.} Bxf3 {Now White must expose the king.} 19. gxf3 {I remember hating having to do this as a less experienced player. I can only imagine White's grief...} e4 {Now I attack both h2 and f3, threatening White more pointless pawn losses and the King.} 20. f4 {The only saving move.} Ng4 {!? - This, I don't understand. I may have been short on time here, but looking back, I shouldn't have moved Ron here. I didn't advance any clear plan of attack, and I also exposed d5 to the queen.} 21. Bb2 {? - White didn't see Qxd5, thankfully, however it is clear that some tempo was restored here.} Qd7 {So I move the queen to pressure the knight, having realized the attack on h2 was impossible at this point, and that if I left her there, then surely Rc1 by White could be devastating...} 22. Qd4 {!? - Threatening Qxg7# instead of just Qxd5 again, however...} Nf6 {! - ...it was perfectly defensible by sitting Ron back here on f6. Nh3 is now doomed.} 23. Ng5 {Futile.} h6 {I secure the knight's capture.} 24. Nxe4 {And he may as well confuse the issue of Black potentially playing Nxe4 here.} dxe4 {But of course, I'm not falling for that! Now White must find a best move facing a clear threat- Qg4.} 25. Kf1 {I think Kh1 was better. If Kh1, and I play Qh3, I can't play Ng4 (threatening Qxh2#) at that point, because as soon as I move my knight, White wins immediately on Qxg7. I could then try Be7 followed by Rfd8 to drive the Queen away, but it requires me to slow down my attack and give White more of a chance to return.} Qh3+ {But since I want to play Qh3 anyway, this check just further gives me more tempo over White.} 26. Ke2 {Now of course, a cornered king USUALLY spells big bad news to us...} Qf3+ {But one closer look at White's King relative to Black's positioning of his pieces can tell you that perhaps the king would have been much safer on h1 after all. } 27. Kf1 {Kf1 is MUCH safer than Kd2, especially after...} Rfd8 {I realize just how limited the White Queen is to squares at this point.} 28. Qd1 {Trying to make up lost momentum by offering a queen exchange.} Qh3+ {But even though I'm in the lead, I recognize that a Queen's primary strength, more than anything else, is her ability to take advantage of an exposed king as evidenced by this game here. I decided that an exchange would be a very foolish move on my part.} 29. Ke2 {White was probably hoping I'd continue trying to perp check, to force a draw.} Bxf4 {! - But I did notice this attack. This brilliant 11-year old pre-pubescent wizard! Thanks to Harry Potter, White can't consider trading the queen for the rook and bishop (Qxd8+, Rxd8! - exf4?? Qd3#). The Boy Who Lived must be ignored, and White loses all control of the kingside at this point.} 30. Bd4 {Really the only conservative move White has, but the position is lost.} Bxh2 {Takus Pawnus!} 31. Qb1 {Is there really anything else for White to do?} Qg2 {That bishop was hindering me more than I'd like though, so I move here to stop the 1-rank rook from moving much at all, while threatening to win this pinned pawn after ...Bg3.} 32. Rf1 {But the rook was sent to defend right away anyway.} Rxd4 {I decide I have enough of a material advantage to be violent at this point, seeing a new threat...} 33. exd4 {Forced.} Nd5 {! - And interestingly enough, a pitchfork has been discovered in White's defenses. After Ron sits out most of the match, he moves to d5, and it's clear that after Nc3, the knight attacks everything precious White has left standing. This is why all the kids back at school call him Wizard Chess Grandmaster! (What a showoff.)} 34. Ke1 {White cannot afford more lost tempo to king checks.} Bf4 {Now Harry Potter fixs up his trusty Moon-Glasses, and sees that if he teleports to f4, Hermione can seal the  Queen's fate after Rc1+ with a quick mate afterwards.} 35. Rc2 {Has anyone else noticed that White has had a lot of "only saving moves" in this game?} Nc3 {So Ron decides to tell the others, just like in the movie, that he has a death wish...} 36. Qb3 {The queen decides he must now be eliminated, as he IS the Wizard Chess Grandmaster...} Qf3 {Good thing these kids are with a different queen who knows how to fight!} 37. Rd2 {Now, of course, White was in a zugzwang of sorts after Qf3, but this just tears it.} Bxd2+ {And there you have it. As it turns out, it wasn't Ron's sacrifice, but actually -Harry Potter- who sacrifices himself for a beautiful Mate in 5! Thanks for reading, folks!} 38. Kxd2 {So much for the Boy who Lived... (but can you see the rest of the mate?)}
