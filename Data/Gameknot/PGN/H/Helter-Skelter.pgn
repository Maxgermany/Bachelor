[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C84), closed defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Ruy Lopez a.k.a. Spanish Opening; Morphy Defence.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Nc3 {So far, pretty standard.  However, this knight development is a little off the modern beaten track.  I knew a correspondence player in this country who used to play this with the express purpose of continuing to d5 and exchanging on e7.  Otherwise I don't really know what theory lies behind this move.} b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. d4 {[?! - in future notes I'll be adding this type of punctuation].  Dubious, in view of what follows.  More circumspect were 8.d3 or 8.Re1.} exd4 {Now: ask yourself this question.  Is it safe for White to recapture on d4?  Has he a better option?} 9. Nxd4 {[?] This recapture might look safe, but in fact is quite unplayable, as the sequel will show.  Better would have been 9.Nd5.} Nxd4 10. Qxd4 {No real choice, but...} c5 {Now White is in the toils of a Noah's Ark Trap.  I happen to know that Joe is aware of the notion of the N.A.T. so I'm a little surprised to see him walk into this one!} 11. Qe3 c4 {Trapping the bishop.  This 'trap' is a well known feature of the Ruy Lopez.} 12. e5 {[!] I give it this mark of approbation, as showing a determination to make the best of the disastrous situation facing White so early in the game.  } Ng4 {[!?] This move is not without risks, ...Ne8 being safer.  } 13. Qf4 {[?] Rather better was 13.Qe4 or maybe 13.Qf3, attacking knight and rook both.  Black would have had to find 13...d5! to avoid the loss of either. E.g.: 14.Qe4 d5!  15.exd6 e.p. Qxd6 (threatening mate on h2) 16.Bf4 Qd7.  This would have led to a complicated tactical melee, favouring Black, for sure, but in the circumstances very welcome to White. } d6 14. Qe4 {Less effective than it would have been a move ago, as the knight now has protection.  } dxe5 {[?] Oversight ... or a sacrifice for attack?  } 15. Qxa8 {[!]  Best.  If Black has anything for the slight material sacrifices, the onus is on him to show it!  In fact, objectively speaking White has the edge right now.  All the same the situation is complicated and combative - and the slugfest is just beginning!} cxb3 16. axb3 {Natural and good.  But 16.cxb3 was also worth considering.} Qc7 {Setting up an 'X-ray' attack against h2.  White had better beware!} 17. Nd5 {[!] Fine response!  } Qd7 18. Nxe7+ {[?!]  Obviously what White had in mind from his previous move, but Black would have had more to worry about after 18.Qc6!!    The idea is, of course, 18...Qxc6 19.Nxe7ch Kh8  20.Nxc6.  If instead 18...Qd8, then 19.Qxc8! Qxc8 {19...Qxd5 20.Qxg4}   20.Nxe7ch Kh8  21.Nxc8 Rxc8 21,Rxa6 with a fine game for White.} Qxe7 19. c4 {[!?] OK, but now would not have been a bad time to chase off the g4-knight (19.h3).} Qh4 {Now h2 comes under a closer assault.  } 20. h3 {Drives off the knight.  Black's second wave of attack has been handily repulsed.} Nf6 21. cxb5 {[!?] Difficult to assess this move.  It is very risky, as what follows will show.  Much safer would have been 21.Qf3, to prevent Black's attacking continuation.} Bxh3 {[!] Excellent attacking move!  Now it's all on.} 22. Rxa6 {[!!/?]  Two exclams for courage; the query because, sadly, it is not the best or safest.  Instead, 22.Qf3 would have stopped Black's K-side attack.  But you just have to admire this move!  (And what a position!)} Bc8 {[!] Of course 22...Rxa8?? led to a very swift quietus!} 23. Ra7 {[??] A terrible mistake, after which Black is once more at White's throat.  Best was 23.Rd1 with the idea 23...Bxa6 24.Rd8 Qb4 25.Rxf8ch Qxf8  26.Qxf8ch Kxf8 27.bxa6 Nd7 28.Be3 ... winning.} Ng4 24. Rd1 {How else to stop the mate?  There is nothing.  White is now in serious trouble once more.} Qxf2+ {[!] } 25. Kh1 Qe2 {[!?] A slight reprieve for White!  Black could have closed out the game with this: 25...e4!! This move closes off several escape routes for the King, and threatens 26...Qh4ch  27.Kg1 Qh2ch 28.Kf1 Qh1ch 29.Ke2 Qxg2ch 30.Ke1 Qf2#.  If White snaps of the pawn by 26.Qxe4, then this would have happened: 26...Qh4ch 27.Kg1 Qh2ch 28.Kf1 Qh1ch  29.Ke2 Qxd1ch!! 30.Kxd1 Nf2ch 31...Nxe4.  Having said all that, and in view of the threat associated with the text move, 25...e4 would not have been easy to find.} 26. Rg1 {[?]  This looks very dangerous - one feels there ought to be a mate in here somewhere, so confined is the White king.  Much safer was 26.Qf3, protecting the rook.} Nf2+ {Good; but ...e4 would still have been effective.  } 27. Kh2 Qg4 {[?!] Threatens mate in one, but White can still wriggle clear.  Best was still 27...e4!, but very nearly as strong would have been 27...Qh5! (I think I would have gone for this line, actually) 28.Kg3 Ng4! 29.Rf1 g5! with the idea 30...Qh4ch and 31...Nh2ch, winning the f1-rook; or, if the rook vacates f1, possibly ...Qf2ch.} 28. Re1 Qh4+ 29. Kg1 Nh3+ {[!] Trying a different tack.} 30. Kh2 {[?] this ought to have led to a quick loss.  White simply had to take the knight, whatever else happened, e.g.: 30.gxh3! Qxe1ch 31.Kh2 Qxc1 and White is busted, but he is not yet checkmated.  } Nf4+ 31. Kg1 Qxe1+ 32. Kh2 Qxc1 {[?!]  Should a move that wins be counted as a bad move because there existed a move that won more quickly?  Black is still winning from here, naturally, but he could have closed the game out at once by 32...Ne2! and mates in 5.} 33. b6 Bd7 {[!?] 33...Ne2!} 34. b7 Ne2 {[!] Threat: ...Qh6#.} 35. Qxf8+ {[!]  Desperation, of course, but still fighting hard.  This is an excellent defence in an almost hopeless position, offering Black some attractive ways of going wrong.} Kxf8 36. b8=Q+ {Material parity is restored, but is White back on level terms?} Ke7 {[??]  He is now!  Better than level terms in fact!  Black still had a winning advantage after the check, but had to find this exciting line: 36...Be8!  37.Qd6ch! Kg8  38.Rxf7! Qg1ch! (The rook can not be taken, on account of 38...Bxf7 39.Qd8ch and White wins!) 39.Kh3 Qh1ch 40.Kg4 Qxg2ch 41.Kf5 Nd4ch! 42.Kxe5  Nc6ch 43.Kf5 Qg6ch 44.Qxg6  hxg6ch 45.Kxg6 Bxf7ch and wins.  What a way to finish a game!} 37. Qxe5+ {Now White is on top... ish.  } Kd8 {Forced.  The alternative would have lost.  I'll leave it to the reader to figure out how.  Clue: White can force checkmate after 37...Kf8.} 38. Qxe2 {[?!] The game now reverts to equality, which, in many respects would have been a very satisfactory result from a spectator's point of view.  But White ought to have offered one more check before snaffling the knight: 38.Ra8ch Bc8  39.Qxe2.  This would have taken the rook off the vulnerable dark-square diagonals, and, the exchange ahead, with passed pawns on the Q-side, White could have made Black work hard just to survive.  But White is by no means behind, even here, provided he stays alert...  Incidentally, even 38.Rxd7ch Kxd7  39.Qxe2 would have led to no disadvantage for White.} Qh6+ 39. Kg3 {Again, safer is Kg1, but the game is still even...} Qg5+ 40. Kf2 Qf4+ 41. Ke1 Qc1+ {Looks like we're heading for a perpetual...} 42. Qd1 {[??] Disaster.  You can see what White was about, can't you: the threat against d7.  But he has overlooked one vital consideration.  Such a shame, for the draw was in his hand after 42.Kf2 Qc5ch 43.Qe3.} Qe3+ 43. Kf1 Qxa7 {0-1 Joe tossed in the sponge at this point, as well he might.  But this was a terrific game, I thought, full of incident.  It shows what can happen with players of widely different strengths and experience, when one plays a little below par, and the other rather above.  A fast-paced helter-skelter ride like this!}
