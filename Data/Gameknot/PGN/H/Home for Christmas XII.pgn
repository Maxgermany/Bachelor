[White "antagonistknight (2153)"]
[Black "chesssafari (2099)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B96), Najdorf, 7.f4"]

1. e4 {At this point I had already looked at chesssafari's profile (I always look at my opponent's page) and after seeing he is a correspondence chess master I decided not to play my favorite 1. f4. Instead I chose to rely on my strength of tactical calculation to go for the win in this game.} c5 {Ah the Sicilian Defense, I must admit I don't really care to see this as white and that is why I tend to play 1. f4, b3 or Nf3 (although here on gameknot I play e4 a lot, in the many OTB games I play the other three openings mentioned).} 2. Nf3 {I normally go with Nc3 here to avoid main line theory, but I wanted to see how a master plays the Sicilian so I chose Nf3 instead.} d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {At this point black still had several options and I was unsure of exactly which of the Sicilian variations he was going for.} a6 {The Najdorf the most popular of the Sicilians, favored by players like Fisher and Kasparov.} 6. Bg5 {I decided to continue with the main line for a couple of moves.} e6 7. f4 {There is just something about the pawn move f2-f4 that I love, at least here it is part of the main line} Nc6 {This is the point we step off the main line, although it is still one of the sub-variations I believe. Qb6 and Be7 are the normal responses.} 8. e5 {I had a couple of options here Nxc6 being the other main option(according to gameknot at least), but I went with the pawn break e4-e5 instead expecting the continuation 8. ... dxe5 9. Nxc6 Qxd1+ 10. Rxd1 bxc6 11. fxe5 which I considered best play by both sides. The continuation would have majorly disrupted black's pawn structure creating two isolated pawns as well as remove the queens from the board, taking the queens out makes it easier to calculate continuations.} h6 {My opponent has other ideas.} 9. Bh4 {I wasn't quite ready to trade away my bishop yet, I was also hoping to entice the Ruy Lopez-like move g5 helping to disrupt black's pawn structure.} g5 {The move I was looking for, this will create many holes in his position due to white being able to take with fxg5 (at this point I was already planning to castle queenside anyway). Because of these weaknesses it would be unlikely for black to castle kingside now, and with the hole on the c-file it looks like his king will be staying in the center making it easier to focus my eventual attack.} 10. fxg5 {I gladly take the g-pawn forcing the knight at f6 to move. This does isolate my e-pawn though, but I had calculated out the continuation 10. ... Nd5 11. Nxd5 exd5 12. exd6 trading it for black's e-pawn creating more open lines for my eventual attack on his then exposed king.} Nd5 {Other options cause the loss of the knight or other material.} 11. Nxd5 {Going with my previous calculation to break up black's pawn structure.} exd5 12. exd6 {The holes are starting to form.} Bxd6 {Black had a few options here, hxg5 was what I perceived best at the time keeping us close to equality. } 13. Nxc6 {This move had 2 benefits, the first being that it releases my queen from guard duty allowing me to develop her and then castling my king to safety on the queenside. The second benefit is that it destroys the pawn structure of a6 and b7, a haven for the black king should he make it to a7.   I also contemplated Qe2+ here but decided to go against the needless check and go with the more positional move.} bxc6 {Three isolated pawns and a very open position for black, not looking good for defensive purposes. This compared to white's position where after castling my position looks solid.} 14. Qd2 {This took my a while to decide, I also looked at Qd4 placing my queen in the center of the board but this comes up against 14. ... Qe7+ 15. Kd2 losing my castling privilege and losing a tempo really (15. Be2 is met with Be5 forcing my queen back). So I went with the quieter move of Qd2. } Qe7+ {A forcing move, trying to develop his pieces and giving his king some breathing room. I find it very interesting that we are up to move 15 and still have not completed development here.} 15. Be2 {Blocking the check so that I can then castle to the queenside and then start attacking.} Rb8 {Black sees that I intend to castle and attacks my now undefended b-pawn, with his dark squared bishop and queen already pointed at a3 he is already formulating his own attack plans.} 16. Bg3 {I must first deal with the many threats to my queenside before developing my attack further. Abandoning the g5-pawn to its fate, I entice an exchange of bishops (also pinning the bishop to the rook on b8)to help diminish black's attacking threats.} hxg5 {Not really sure what other options black had here, taking with the bishop 16. ... Bxg3 was bad due to 17. hxg3 Bg4 18. Rxh6.} 17. Bxd6 {Diminishing one of the threats, allowing me to castle more safely. } Qxd6 18. O-O-O {Finally I have finished development, I felt a little safer now and felt that it was only a matter of time now due to the weaknesses in black's position (in reality we were still about equal, my only advantages being positional)} Qb4 {This move was not what I was expecting, it looks like black was trying to trade queens here. Earlier I was willing to trade queens before the position had fully taken shape, but now it was more advantageous for me to keep mine on the board. f6 was probably best here to support the g5-pawn to at least keep some structure to his pawns.} 19. c3 {c3! I decline the exchange, attack his queen and defend the b-pawn all in one move.} Qb6 {Still trying to keep pressure on the b-pawn, if he had really wanted to trade queens then black could have gone with Qf4. Although I feel that even after the exchange on f4 white is better due to his stronger pawn structure.} 20. b3 {Releasing some of the pressure allowing my queen to move.} f6 21. Rdf1 {With black's attack refuted it is time to start an assault on his position, I begin by attacking his unguarded f-pawn.} Ke7 {Black had a couple other options Qd8 or Rh6, but Ke7 was probably best.} 22. h4 {Sacrificing the pawn to allow Qf4 lining up my queen and rook with either continuation.} gxh4 23. Qf4 {Black has to the threat of Qxf6+ forking the king and rook now.} c5 {Defending the f-pawn while keeping the pressure on white's position, should white falter black can push the c or d pawn forward to break through his defense.} 24. Rfe1 {Setting up a discovered check for black to deal with, threatening  Bc4+ followed by Bxd5. At this point I am building up small positional advantages that should eventually lead to a win.} Kd8 {One of the few "safe" squares for the time being.} 25. Red1 {Lining up the rook again (threatening Rxd5+) all the responses for black's defense of the d-pawn weaken his position. } d4 {The lesser of the evils so to speak, Be6 is met with 26. Qxf6+ Kc7 27. Qe7+ and if black moves the queen the rook on b8 falls.} 26. cxd4 {Still threatening the discovered check with dxc5 unless black chooses the proper defense.} Bd7 {The best option was c4 so that my d-pawn would continue to block my rook and cxd4 is just bad for black.} 27. Bc4 {Setting up for the final assault, at which point black sees the inevitable and resigns. I did not have a forced win, but he would have had a sharp defense that because of his structural weaknesses he could not have withstood for very long.  I would have to say that I enjoyed this game very much. It was against a very tough opponent in an opening that I had never played before that made it very interesting.}
