[Opening "English (A30), symmetrical, hedgehog system"]

1. c4 {This was my first time to play against English.  With English, a reasonable approach is just to mirror.  The upside it that mirroring English leads right into a Sicilian Dragon, which *is* in my bag of openings.} c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d3 d6 4. Nc3 g6 {I couldn't help but break off into the dragon, especially since I had no idea where the English has heading.} 5. Qc2 Bg7 6. g3 Nc6 7. Bg5 O-O 8. Bg2 Bg4 {One last little bit of mirroring.  It was the most sensible thing to do.} 9. O-O {Even though I tried to go in a different direction from the English, we ended up with essentially identical positions.} e6 {Here I completed the half pin to build up my center structure and to lend some support to the king's knight.} 10. h3 {This was a dumb move.  I was planning Bxf3 anyway.  h3 just sealed his king and bishop into a tomb of pawns after his next move.} Bxf3 11. exf3 {Another dumb move.  This may look like a strong defensive structure, but as we'll see later, it's even more effective at trapping his own pieces.} d5 {My goal with d4 was two-fold.  First, I wanted to take control of the center.  Second, I wanted to open up my e file.  I succeeded in doing both.} 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Rfd1 Qd7 {Qd7 opens up communication between my rooks, and prepares my queen to get into the fray.} 14. Ne2 {Prevents Nd4 and serves to annoy me for most of the rest of the game.  This move is perhaps the strongest move my opponent makes.} Qf5 {I was hoping to get f4 as a response, so I could follow with h6, g5, gxh4.  A guy can dream, can't he?} 15. Be3 {I stared at this position forever.  The obvious move was d4.  It was so obvious that my opponent was clearly leading me to it.  I tried very hard to find the trap, but couldn't.  In the end I had to conclude that I was just being paranoid.} d4 16. Bf4 Nb4 {At this point I'm just prodding him to see what happens.  He has very little room to move, and so lots of potential for getting hung up in his own pieces.} 17. Qb3 {Predictable.} Nfd5 {I was trying to put more pressure on the bishop and increase my odds of doing something nasty to the queen.  I really wanted to triple the f file pawns.} 18. g4 {Didn't expect that, but it opened up some other oppotunities, even though it killed my plans for tripled pawns.  Notably, it weaked the support for his bishop.} Qe6 {Dangerous, but I figured I'd be able to profit from the discovered attack one way or another.  Plus, it leaves him trying to saving his knight.  More opportunities for mistakes.} 19. Rd2 {And here's the big mistake.  Here's where I saw the pin in move 21.} Nxf4 {Because of g4, the only response is Nxf4.} 20. Nxf4 Qxb3 {Now to get the queens out of the way and double some pawns while I'm at it.} 21. axb3 Bh6 {Now, at this point it looks pretty bad for my opponent, but he still has a very strong defensive structure.} 22. Kf1 {I have no idea where he was going with that.} Bxf4 {I claim my prize.} 23. Rdd1 b6 {Here I'm preparing for either a5 to free my rook, or Nc6, Na5 to attack the front b pawn.  At this point I was pretty sure breaking through those defenses was going to be hopeless.} 24. Ke2 {No idea.} Rfe8+ {I thought his king was better off trapped behind the pawns.} 25. Kf1 g5 {Just to make sure the pawns stayed where they were...} 26. Bh1 {Here my opponent puts into motion a plan, but I still don't know why he did it.  First he gets his king off the first rank, and then we proceed to trade rooks, leaving him completely toothless.} a5 {I decided freeing the rook was more useful than attacking the pawn.} 27. Rde1 {What the...?} Nxd3 {Not only was the idea of trading rooks bad, but it cost him a very important pawn.} 28. Rxe8+ {Senseless trade.  I asked him what he was doing, and his response sounded like he hadn't noticed that he was down by a knight.} Rxe8 29. Bg2 {I think he's just killing time.} Nxb2 {Another free pawn, and I'm trying to shake the last rook loose.  My plan was: 30. Rb1 Bd2 31. All hell breaks loose} 30. Re1 {An even more senseless trade.} Rxe1+ 31. Kxe1 {His king has now escaped his prision, sort of.  With my bishop, knight, and d pawn, he really can't go anywhere.  What's worse is that he just has to sit by and watch while I queen at least three of my pawns.} d3 32. Kf1 d2 {Here my opponent thoughtfully resigned.}
