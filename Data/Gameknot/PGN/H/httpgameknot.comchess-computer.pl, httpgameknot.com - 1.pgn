[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 {This was my first win over the casual level computer(I kept making tactical mistakes), so I decided to share it.   My favorite opening move.} e6 {Heading for the French Defense.} 2. d4 {Standard French Defense.} Nf6 {d5 is usual, but Nf6 is also fine.} 3. Nc3 {Threatening to kick the knight back to g8 with e5.  d4 immediately would allow Nd4 and Black could defend Qd3 (or Bd3) with d5.  If exd6 e.p. then Nxd6 regains the pawn and puts the knight on a safe post.} Bb4 {Pinning the knight and preparing to meet e5 with Ne4.} 4. Bd3 {Protects e4, and starts threat of e5 all over again.  Bxc3 is not bad for white, because the b pawn will be doubled toward the center.} d5 {Getting a stake of the center, and threating to win a pawn by dxe5.  However, the d5 square for the knight is now blocked. } 5. e5 {Logical pawn push to displace the knight.} Ne4 {This threatens to win a pawn after exchances on c3, but if Bxe4 dxe4 the d pawn might be easily won.} 6. Bxe4 {Exchanging bishop for knight to give black a weak doubled pawn.} dxe4 {Forced, unless black wants to trade off his bishop for knight with check.} 7. Be3 {Supporting the base of the pawn chain.  Nge3 might have been better.} Nc6 {Developing a piece.} 8. Nge2 {Finally playing Nge3, with the idea of a3 and castling soon after.} O-O {Castling, but allows white to play a3.} 9. a3 {Chasing the bishop.} Bxc3+ {This is black's first real mistake.  After Nxc3, there is no way black can protect his e4 pawn (if f5 then exf6 e.p.)  Ba5 was better.   } 10. Nxc3 {Recapturing the piece and attacking the e4 pawn. } f6 {Trying to hold on to the e4 pawn.} 11. exf6 {Trading off pawns and forcing the win of the e4 pawn.} Qxf6 {Taking the pawn back.  Rxf5 may have been better.} 12. Nxe4 {Winning a pawn and attacking the queen.} Qg6 {Moving the queen out of attack and threatening the g2 pawn and e4 knight.} 13. Ng3 {Qf3 was also playable.} e5 {e5 tries to trade off the pawn to centralize the knight. } 14. d5 {Attacking the knight.} Nd4 {Ne7 was probably better because it doesn't trade off any pieces.} 15. Bxd4 {Trade when you're ahead.} exd4 {Recapturing the piece.} 16. Qxd4 {Trading off another pair of pawns.} Re8+ {Qxc2 was much better.  This move allows me to have two extra pawns.} 17. Kd1 {Protecting the pawn.  Kd2 was probably better as it connects the rooks.} Bf5 {Allowing me to trade off even more pieces.} 18. Nxf5 {More trading.} Qxf5 {Recapturing and threatening the f pawn.} 19. f3 {Protecting the f pawn.} Re5 {This wins the d pawn and threatens to pin the queen to the king. } 20. Kc1 {Stepping away from the pin.} Rxd5 {Black wins a pawn back.} 21. Qe4 {Trying to trade off queens.} Rad8 {Black should have retreated the queen in order for it not to be exchanged.} 22. Qxf5 {Trading queens.} Rxf5 {Forced.} 23. Rd1 {Trying to trade off rooks.} Rfd5 {Maintaining control of the open file, but another pair of rooks are traded off.} 24. Rxd5 {Trading rooks.} Rxd5 {Forced.} 25. b4 {Trying to open up my rook with Rb1 and Rb3.} Rh5 {Attacking my h pawn.} 26. Kd2 {I knew that the computer was not strong in the endgame and took my chances by centralizing my king and opening up my rook.  I did not like the look of h3 because my g pawn would become weak.} Rxh2 {Winning a pawn and threatening another.} 27. Rg1 {Forced to protect the g2 pawn.} b5 {This move overextends the b pawn and makes it into a target.} 28. Kc3 {Heading off toward the b pawn.} g5 {Black should start moving his king into the game.  It may be too late as the pawn on g5 prevents the rook from protecting the b pawn from afar.} 29. Kd4 {Still going after the pawn.} Kg7 {This move probably loses.  Rh5 was much better as it allowed c6 without losing a pawn.} 30. Kc5 {Black now loses a pawn and the game.} a6 {Desparately trying to hold on to the pawn.} 31. Kc6 {Attacking another undefended pawn.} Rh4 {Trying to meet Kxc7 with Rc4+ } 32. Kxc7 {Taking the pawn anyway.} Rc4+ {Winning the pawn back.} 33. Kb6 {But now white wins another pawn.} Rxc2 {Winning a pawn.} 34. Kxa6 {I am now up a winning pawn.} Ra2 {Threatening my a pawn.} 35. Kxb5 {I simply take black's b pawn and march my passed pawn up the board.} Rxa3 {Taking a pawn, but it is too late to save the game.} 36. Kc4 {Preparing to advance the pawn.} Ra2 {Defending from behind.} 37. b5 {Pushing the pawn.} Rc2+ {Checking from behind.} 38. Kb3 {I tried to chase the rook, but I soon found out that I needed to play Kd5.} Rd2 {If b6? then Rd6 wins the pawn (b7 Rb6+)} 39. Kc4 {Repeating the position.} Rc2+ {Same position as on move 37.} 40. Kd5 {The right move to advance the pawn.} Rd2+ {Checking again.} 41. Kc6 {The king advances even farther.} Rc2+ {Checking once more.} 42. Kb7 {Forcing an advance of the pawn.} h5 {Pushing another pawn.} 43. b6 {Pushing my pawn.} g4 {This move allows me to trade of another pair of pawns and overextends black's pawn even more.} 44. fxg4 {Trading pawns.} hxg4 {h4 probably would have been even worse} 45. Kb8 {Threatening to push the pawn again.} g3 {Black should centralize his king with f6.} 46. b7 {Pushing the pawn again.} Re2 {Marking time.  Again, Kf6 was better.} 47. Kc7 {This move doesn't work as the next few moves show.} Rc2+ {Checking the king to back where he came from.} 48. Kb8 {Moving my king back.} Re2 {Marking time.  Kf6 is still better.} 49. Rc1 {This is the solution.  My rook blocks the c file.} Rxg2 {Black wins a pawn and is almost ready to promote.  The only difference is that my pawn is one square closer to promotion.} 50. Kc7 {Ready to promote.} Rb2 {Trying to stop the pawn.} 51. b8=Q {I push the pawn anyway.} Rxb8 {Black takes my queen, but his pawn won't queen.} 52. Kxb8 {Taking the rook.} g2 {Black can't hold onto the pawn anyway.  If Kf6 Rg1 Kf5 and Rxg3.} 53. Rg1 {I win the pawn.} Kf6 {Black is hopeless.} 54. Rxg2 {The rest is a simple rook and king mate.} Ke6 55. Rg5 Kd6 56. Kb7 Ke6 57. Kc7 Kf6 58. Rd5 Ke6 59. Kc6 Kf6 60. Kd7 Kg7 61. Rf5 Kg6 62. Ke6 Kh6 63. Kf6 Kh7 64. Rg5 Kh6 65. Rf5 Kh7 66. Rg5 Kh6 67. Rg1 Kh5 68. Rg6 Kh4 69. Kf5 Kh3 70. Kf4 Kh2 71. Kf3 Kh1 72. Kf2 Kh2 73. Rh6# {The final position.}
