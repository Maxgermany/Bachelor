1. c4 {English opening...has a bit of reputation of being a relatively dull opening...this is mainly due(i think) to the little bit of patience needed to build up and is not as hairy as Sicilians....!!} e5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 Bc5 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e3 {..standard development so far. White is threatening d4 and build up pressure on the Q side. Black will usually counter the finachetto of an English with c6, Be6 and Qd7 to create a weakness on the K side. This is typically followed by f5 and further attacks. White typically needs to eliminate the Nf6...} d6 6. Nge2 {..preparing 0-0 and d4} c6 7. O-O Bg4 8. Qb3 {..releasing the pin and threatening to win material. Best way to force lines.} Qe7 {..i though Qd7 was better, but the Knight needs to centralise- Na6-c7 might be an option to support a d5 push...?} 9. d4 exd4 10. Nxd4 Bxd4 11. exd4 {...need to link the rooks so to find a home for the dark square bishop...} b6 12. Be3 {..with the Bg4, i do not have to worry for now about the Nf6. Rae1 to follow with indirect threats to the Q...} Bd7 13. Rae1 Qd8 14. Nb5 {..tempt the winning of excahnge by cb followed by Bxa8. Also threatening to win  the pawn on d6} d5 15. Nc3 dxc4 16. Qxc4 b5 17. Qd3 a5 {...similar principal to 14. to follow} 18. Nxb5 Na6 19. Nc3 {..pawn up....} Nb4 20. Qd2 Bf5 {..spotting blacks little attack..i see the c6 pawn as hanging. a3 will misplace the knight.} 21. Rec1 Nbd5 22. Bg5 {..preventing Ne4 where black is trying to get my white square bishop !!} Qd6 23. Nxd5 {..some mini traps here...with the long diagonal very strong...} Be4 {...bad mistake from black....white is now material up. I spotted a continuation where i give the piece back, but end the exchange up of rook for Queen...and it start with....} 24. Nxf6+ {..the move black may have missed..an intermediate. I now have the c6 pawn in sight with a position collapse for black in mind...} gxf6 25. Bxe4 fxg5 {...giving the piece back but now the Queen is in trouble and whites attack is quick.} 26. Rxc6 Qe7 27. Re1 {..forcing the queen away as Bxh7  wins the queen.} Qb4 {..so now to the combination. I saw that the Queen has only check and a forced exchange down to stay in the game. So...first } 28. Qxg5+ {..the obvious...} Kh8 {..forced...} 29. Qf5 {..now threatening mate so black is forced into the following 2 moves and i'm well up in material, and position is won..} Qxe1+ 30. Kg2 {...safe as houses...} Qxe4+ 31. Qxe4 f5 32. Qe5+ Kg8 33. Rc7 {...last gasp....but combination is still forced....white wins with a forcing of material off the board and left with a very active queen to mop up..} Rf7 34. Rxf7 Kxf7 35. Qd5+ Kf6 {..black resigns...}
