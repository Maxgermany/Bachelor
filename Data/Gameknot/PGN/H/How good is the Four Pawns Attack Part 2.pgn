1. d4 {Hi everyone, after playing a game called How Good is the Four Pawns Attack Part 1, my mentor, Ion showed me a game of his where he played against the Four Pawns Attack.  Mistakes were made on both sides but Ion was more fortunate than I was in my Four Pawns Attack - he drew.} Nf6 {1. ............ Nf6 - the most common response in the database.  This knight move is made to hinder e4 and develops a piece.  As you will see, however, white soon gets round that problem!} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f4 {5. f4 - and here we have it - the Four Pawns Attack - just like in my game, but it deviates later on.  White has a fine pawn centre and black must find a way to make a dent in it.} O-O 6. Nf3 c5 {6. ............... c5 - here is the attempt to breach the wall.  BK plays d5 to keep his central array of pawns together.} 7. d5 e6 8. Be2 exd5 9. exd5 {9. exd5 - (!) {Ion stated - I used to play 9.e5!? here}.  In my game against michael I took with the c pawn instead - maybe this move is an improvement.  White can keep his kingside and queenside pawns together this way and the pawn structure may come under less strain than the other capture.  It does leave the e file open for a black rook to come on it so white would strongly be advised to castle on his next move, which he does.} Bf5 {9. ............... Bf5 - Ion stated here "I didn't know this line, and thought that this obvious move couldn't be bad. Ironically, I considered but rejected the better 9...b5!?" } 10. O-O Na6 {10. .....Na6?!  - Ion stated that "This would have been better a move earlier, too. Now the knight has nowhere to go, after 11. a3.   Hmm, Ion, what about Nc7?  Although it seems that the knight may not be able to go anywhere significant after that, on c7 it does prepare an advance of the black a and b pawns and the possibility of undermining the queenside pawn chain by playing an eventual b5. } 11. a3 Re8 {11. ............ Re8 - rooks belong on open files.  Here there could be a possibility of a doubling on e7 and e8 putting more pressure on white's lsb.} 12. Bd3 {12.Bd3 ... Ion stated that "Already I didn't like the way this was going..."  } Ne4 13. Nxe4 Bxe4 14. f5 {14.f5! ... Ion stated that "This move is very much a theme of this whole line. I felt that I was in deep trouble now, and it was going to get worse!"   I think white threatens to exchange pawns here or force a doubling on the f file, either way, black's castled position will start to look a little draughty which could be problematical if the queens are on the board. } gxf5 15. Ng5 Qf6 {15 .............. Qf6??  - Ion stated here "It transpires that up to here Black's game was still playable, but this move was a complete miscalculation."   The aim of this move was to try and drive away the knight on e5.  This move loses a piece because black's foremost f pawn is pinned to the black queen. } 16. Nxe4 Qd4+ {16. ...........Qd4 ??  Ion stated that he thought this move was terrible because it is "compounding the error. Had I played 16...Rxe4 I would have got out with only the loss of the exchange: 16...Rxe4 17.Bxe4 Qd4  18.Qxd4 Bxd4  19.Kh1 fxe4 and Black at least can make a game of it."   The intent of this move here was to get out of the pin with check and to reclaim the piece by capturing on e4 with the f pawn, unfortunately white gets his knight out of the road by playing Nf2 - Ion is a piece for a pawn down.  The position is not resignable yet - remember a pawn can crown, a piece cannot.  The defender must find some vigorous counterplay, however or white could increase this material advantage.  Ion now creates complications, and as mentioned in a previous note, they earn him half a point.  I do not know the rating differentials of the two protagonists here - this could also have some bearing on the decision to play on or not. } 17. Nf2 {17.Nf2 ...  Natch! I had completely overlooked this move, until Bruce played it. Now, until this game, I had always beaten Bruce - a good journeyman club player apt to get into the most appalling timetrouble. I could have resigned the game here - Black is quite lost - but I wanted jst to make some kind of fight for it... } Re7 {17. ............. Re7? - Ion stated that he came up with this uninspiring move } 18. Bxf5 Rae8 19. Qxd4 Bxd4 {19. ................ Bxd4 - white will now try and trade pieces in order to snuff out any counterplay that black will attempt to rustle up.} 20. Bf4 Re7e2 21. Bxd6 Rxb2 {21. ........... Rxb2 - when you are down on material it pays to exchange pawns rather than pieces.  Here Ion has managed to double rooks on the e file as I mentioned in a previous note.  He has managed to get a rook down on the 7th rank which can be a bone in the throat.  This resulted in Ion netting the b pawn and wrecking white's queenside pawn structure through the back door - black's queenside pawn structure is more intact.  Ion is also threatening a move like R x N (uncovering an attack on the a1 rook) - white sidestepps this threat with Rad1.} 22. Rad1 Rb6 23. Bg3 Rf6 {23. Rf6 - Ion stated here "you gotta damire this rook's agility!} 24. Bg4 Nb8 {24. .........Nb8 ...  When in doubt, try and improve the position of your least useful piece. It doesn't matter if or whether this is the "best" move: Black is still busted, but trying still to create problems. For the last few moves, White has been reacting to Black's moves, but now he has a free hand.  } 25. d6 {25.d6 ...  Logical and good, but I was pleased to see my knight get a useable square.   Such as Nc6.} Nc6 26. d7 Ra8 {26. ...........Ra8 ...  I seriously considered 26...Rf8, and for a long time thought it might have been better. But it's academic. really. Black still has nothing for the piece. } 27. Bh4 Rf4 28. Rde1 Kf8 {28. .......... Kf8!? - Ion stated "I didn't like the look of 28...Rxg4 29.Re8 !"   Yup, white is determined to crown that d pawn! } 29. d8=Q+ {29.d8=Q?! ...   Ion stated here - "After this, I began to feel that things were looking up. White has sacced his advanced pawn to induce an exchange. Not bad exactly, yet I felt he ought to have got more out of that d-pawn."  Yup, it exchanges another set of pieces but Ion now has 2 pawns for the missing piece.} Nxd8 30. Bxd8 Rxd8 31. Bf3 b6 32. Kh1 Bxf2 33. Rxf2 Rxc4 34. Bh5 {34.Bh5! ...   Ion stated here - "It had to come. Black has got a Q-side majority that might come in useful, but his f-pawn is a goner."  Ion now tries to defend the f pawn with Rd7 but Ref1 doubles up on the f pawn.  Oh dear!   But I think that that passed black c pawn may well have something to say. } Rd7 35. Ref1 Rc3 36. Rf2f3 {36.Rf3?  - Ion gave this move a question mark as he expected 36.Bxf7! here as White's best move, but was hoping for 36.Rxf7 ?! Rxf7 37.Bxf7 Rxa3 with a fighting chance to save the game. After 36.Bxf7, the a3-pawn is taboo, of course (36...Rxa3?? 37.Be6  - this discovered check wins the black rook on d7). But what to make of the move played? White had made a simple tactical oversight.   Ion hangs on to his f pawn because after the rooks are exchanged on f3 white must recapture with the bishop because if he recaptures with the rook he will cop Old Matey on f1.  Do note that the white rook on f3 will interefere with the white bishop's diagonal onto d1. } Rxf3 {36...Rxf3!   Ion gives his thoughts here - White can not retake with the rook. Ordinarily Black would avoid exchanges, but I was hoping to round up White's a-pawn. Though he still has the edge, much of White's early advantage has evaporated, as Black is planning to offset White's material advantage by promotion threats on the Q-side.   And white's a3 pawn is very weak and could be picked off at the right moment.  } 37. Bxf3 Rd3 38. Ra1 c4 {38.  ............ c4?  - Here Ion thought that this move was ...  A careless slip brought on by a new-found confidence...  } 39. Be4 {39.Bd4 ...  ...that was rapidly brought to earth by this move. All the same we have to keep on truckin' } Rb3 {39...Rb3?!  Played to obviate any shenanighans on the b-file. But 39...Rd2 was probably better. You know: rook on the 7th and all that...  } 40. Bxh7 b5 41. Kg1 {41.Kg1 (sealed) ...  At the adjournment I expected White's 41st and studied the position according. I felt that Black's changes were fair at best.  } a5 42. Rb1 {42.Rb1! ...  I thought this a very good move. I had hoped that if pawns were exchanges on the Q-side that at least the remaining two would be on adjacent files. This rook move squashes that idea. Naturally, the rook exchange doesn't come into consideration.} Rxa3 43. Rxb5 c3 {43. .......... c3?  Inaccurate. 43...a4 was the right move. If then 44.Rc5, Rc3 threatens ...a3.  } 44. Bc2 Ra1+ 45. Kf2 {The rest of the annotation does not quite tally with the actual game but I will now give the rest of the moves here.  All the comments are Ion's.    45.Kf2 a3!  Now I thought Black had very good drawing chances.  46.Rxc3 Rc1! 47.Rxa3 ...  White had no choice  47...Rxc2  48.Kg3 Kg7 49.Kh3 Rc1 50.Kh3 Rc1  This ending is a "book" draw. Though I wasn't absolutely sure of that at the time, I felt pretty confident of holding out. As it happens, Bruce didn't make the best of the ending, making almost no progress at all for the rest of the game:  51.Kh4 Rc2 52.Kg3 Rc1 53.Rf3 Ra1 54.Kg4 Ra4  55.Rf4 Ra2  56.Kf3 Ra3  57.Kf2 Ra2  58.Kg3 Ra3  59.Rf3 Ra2 60.Rf2 Ra3   61.Kh4 Ra1 62.g4 Ra3 63.h3 f6!? 64.Rf5 Kg6 65.Rb5 Rc3 Draw agreed.  White's K-side position is completely stymied, and can not progress further.  }
