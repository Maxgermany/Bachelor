1. e4 {The King's Pawn Play.} e5 {He responds to my last move with the King's Pawn Opening, but I am used to seeing this.} 2. Nf3 {Now, I decide to start developing minor pieces, so I transpose the King's Pawn Opening into the King's Knight opening.  I also wanted to capture his pawn, but that was not the logic behind this move.} d6 {Even though he does not play the Sicilian Defense, this move is still studied by masters and grandmasters, so this is !.  In fact, Jack Stockel has told me that it is similar to the Sicilian Defense, due to the position, and that it is good to make a move that is studied by masters and grandmasters.  However, there is a draw back with this candidate because his bishop is now blocked on f8, and it is his dominant bishop since it is black.  That is because he is also playing black, and Jack Stockel has also said to me that ones dominant bishop is the same color that he or she is playing.} 3. Bc4 {This move is the proper continuation of the Ruy Lopez opening.} Nf6 {At this point, I begin to catch a cold and feel tired because, so I am oblivious to the fact that he is now threatening to take a free pawn.  Instead, I am only interested in castling for the continuation of the Ruy Lopez opening.  Therefore, my judgment is ? in addition to my next move because it will enable him to capture a free pawn when 4. 0-0, Nxe4 are played.} 4. O-O Nxe4 5. Bd5 {I respond by boxing in his pawns on d6 and e5, and I also threaten to capture his knight with Bxe4.  This will force him to protect his knight, but this move is ?.} Nf6 {That is because he now threatens to capture my dominant bishop for free, in this position, and he will be successful due to my next blunder.} 6. d3 {That move was ?? because this will give away my dominant bishop.  In other words, it will allow him to capture my dominant bishop for free when Nxd5 is played.  This is also where I have some cold-like symptoms.  It only gets worse from here.   } Nxd5 7. Nc3 {In this position, I could have played Bg5 and threatened to capture his queen Bxd8, but I did not want to do that because it would have been a wasted move.  If I had played Bg5, he probably would have played f6, and that would have forced me to move my bishop away from danger.  Therefore, I play Nc3, but this is not the best, either.  In fact, it was ? because I will have two bad pawns on the c file when Nxc3 and bxc3 are played. } Nxc3 8. bxc3 Be7 {I do not know why he made this move.} 9. Qe2 {This was actually ?.  Instead, I should have played Nd2, for I am now in big trouble.  However, my cold like symptoms have also progressed. } Bg4 {In this position, my knight is now pinned on g4, so the game is almost lost.  However, I still want to hang in there because I remember Jack Stockel's advice of, "Don't give up right away".} 10. d4 {Therefore, I am now trying to fix a blunder by attempting to relocate my pawns.  In other words, I want to fix my two bad pawns and make it so that one pawn is on d4, and the other is on c2.  However, it is now, "too little, two late" because he will force an exchange with Bxf3 followed by Qxf3. } Bxf3 11. Qxf3 O-O {At this point, he decides to castle.} 12. Qxb7 {I chose this candidate by taking a free pawn and threatening to capture his rook with Qxb8 in my attempt to fix my mistakes.  However, I will not be successful because it is still, "too little, too late".} Nd7 {He sees my intentions and protects his rook by moving the knight.} 13. Re1 {I do not know why I made this move.} Bf6 {He chose this candidate in order to form a, "Fianchetto" because his pawn on e5 was already protected.} 14. Be3 {I do not know why I made this move because my pawn on d4 was protected by the pawn on c3. } Qb8 {In this position, he now threatens to force an, "even exchange", but I am not going to make any exchanges, at the moment because I am, "down material".  Therefore, I want to do one of two things.  I either want to capture a free piece that is not a, "deflective sacrifice", or I want to make an exchange where I will be, "neck to neck" with a score of 0 or in the + range.  However, that will not happen here. } 15. Qc6 {I play a powerful fork between his rook on a8 and his knight on d7, in my attempt to, "even the odds", by capturing his knight with Qxd7.  However, this plan fails.} Rd8 {That is because he sees my intentions and protects his knight with the rook on d8.} 16. dxe5 {This move was ??.  I should have waited for him to capture my pawn, instead of playing the fork and making the capture.  On the other hand, this is where I have my worst symptoms of the cold.  Now, the game is lost, but I still want to continue, in case he makes a blunder.  However, that does not happen.} Bxe5 {Now, I am in a terrible position and do not have many options.} 17. Bd2 {My pawn on c3 was only protected by my queen on c6, so I needed another piece for protection.  Jack Stockel has told me that it is important to count the pieces.} Qb6 {In this position, he is threatening to force an, "even exchange".  However, I am not feeling well, so I inadvertently accept the exchange with Qxb6, followed by Nxb6.} 18. Qxb6 Nxb6 19. Bg5 {In this position, I threaten to force an exchange by capturing his rook with my bishop, (Bxe8 followed by Rxe8.)  I was trying to fix my mistakes but was not successful in doing so.} f6 {He sees the threat, as I thought, but I thought that he would move his rook away from the, "danger zone".  However, it is much worse then I thought because he protects the rook with his pawn.} 20. Bd2 {This move is forced.  In this position, my bishop and the pawn on c3 are both protected.} Nc4 {In this position, he now threatens to capture my bishop on d2 for free.  I only had two options to do this.} 21. Red1 {If I did not feel, "under the weather" I would have connected my rooks with Rac1.  However, I am beginning to feel better, but I am still fatigued and tired, at this point.  In addition, he will force an exchange and get a free piece with Nxd2 followed by Rxd2.  Above all, it is, once again, "too little, too late" to make corrections.} Nxd2 22. Rxd2 Bxc3 {Not only has he captured a free pawn, but he now has a very powerful fork against me between my rooks on d5 and a1.  However, I do not resign yet because I am hoping to hide my blunder and prevent him from taking action, but I am not successful.} 23. Rd5 {At this point, I have almost completely recovered from the cold, but, "the damage has been done".  That is because, he will capture my rook, so the game is now inevitably lost.} Bxa1 {At this point, I resign because I am now at -9, and it is not going to change.  In fact, things will only get worse because he now has an inevitable mating pattern against me and will mate me as soon as he is able to play Re1#.  As I mentioned earlier, I was tired and fatigued due to a cold.  In this case I was lucky because I recovered from this cold quickly, in a 5 day period.   However, I know that it could take weeks to recover from a cold, but I do not have weeks to make a move.  I did, however, learn an important lesson from this game combined with two other games from a chess mentor, not Jack Stockel.  It is better to play in a closed position, instead of using advanced tactics when he or she is, "under the weather".  In addition to that lesson, how does one play good chess when he or she is sick?  }
