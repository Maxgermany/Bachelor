[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed, 2...Nc6"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {Not the usual knight move in the Sicilian but is very transpositional in nature. Still I do think Nf3 ultimately give white the best winning chances. In the current position black has no trouble equalizing.  } Nc6 {developing the knight and preparing for the exchange on d4. } 3. Nf3 e6 {The most direct approach, denying the white knight the ability to jump to d5.  } 4. Be2 Nd4 {Establishes a forward position for the knight and creating exchange threats on f3 and e2 if it is beneficial for black at some point. The strategic idea is to create a long term structural pawn weakness that can be exploited later on} 5. O-O a6 {utility move that threatens b7-b5 at some point while limiting the influence of the LSB and white knight. } 6. b3 {a great move that opens up all kinds of deadly possibilities along the dark diagonal. So much so, black is kinda forced to develop his DSB to a less than ideal spot. } Bd6 {with the up coming Bb2 e5 will be come a hot spot on the board so I play Bd6 to get some control and protection on it. Part of being a higher class player is being able to accurately predict what your opponent plans to do in the future and do something about it before it becomes a problem. Most chess players only respond to current threats not latent threats.  } 7. Bb2 Ne7 {The knight is going to g6 where it can help in the fight for control of e5. } 8. Bd3 {Interesting move that allows white to play Ne2 clearing the way for the DSB. White plans to exchange the strong black knight for his weaker one. While at the same time creating a weak pawn on d4 that is easy to attack. } Qc7 {Developing and anticipating to meet the knight exchange by playing Bxh2 creating a weakness of my own. } 9. Nxd4 cxd4 10. Ne2 {attacking the weak d-pawn. } Bxh2+ {regaining the pawn before I loss it. While at the same time creating a critical weakness in the king position. This weakness becomes important later on} 11. Kh1 Bd6 12. Nxd4 {Now black has the great f4 outpost. } Ng6 {heading to f4 but white has a great tactical reply} 13. Qh5 {at first glance it looks like white will loss tempo against ...Nf4 but white can play for the exchange of queens and deny black the ability to castle. All of this is enough compensation for the threat of ....Nf4. However, black does get to create a further pawn structure weakness on d3. Which could prove difficult to defend if we end up in a rook+bishop endings. } Nf4 14. Qg5 {next few moves are forced. } Nxd3 15. cxd3 Qd8 16. Qxd8+ Kxd8 17. Nc2 {threatening b7 and regrouping the knight to e3 maybe?} f6 {defending b7 and limiting the influence of the white bishop. You always want to make sure that you have a firm control in the centre. Game are won and lost when players give up to much control in the center. } 18. f4 {excellent move that really puts pressure on e5 that will be very hard to resist} Rf8 {I plan to deflect that battle away from e5 and on to f6 where I am stronger. Placing the rook on f8 supporting f6 and deflecting my bishop to e7 will ensure I have equality. } 19. e5 Be7 20. f5 {another fantastic move that threatens to create a nice weak pawn on e6. } a5 {denying white the ability of his knight going to b4 in the event of an exchange on f6  } 21. exf6 Bxf6 {directly challenging it's counterpart} 22. fxe6 dxe6 {essentially equal here as both sides have major structural weaknesses } 23. Rac1 Bd7 24. Ne3 {nice move white threatens Nc4 with a nice position} b5 {forced but the black pawns on the queen side have potential to rip things wide open. Also to black's advantage is the pawn majority on the king side in the event that this becomes a two way horse race. } 25. Kg1 {smart idea to get the king closer to the center} a4 {kind of a strange move but this really complicates the position for white. White has no less than three options here all of which at first glance look equal but only one has promise for a draw. } 26. Bc3 {first real inaccuracy, though not a real game changer. For one it hinders the rook and add no real value to white. I wonder if Oddlord looked at 26. Ng4!? leading to further exchanges. Of course also worth looking at for white is stopping the queen pawn storm for good with 26. b4 when shifting everything to the king side and playing for a draw is inevitable.  } h5 {denying white's main counterplay of Ng4 and gaining space on the kingside. } 27. Bxf6+ {?! another small but important inaccuracy. I guess idea is to exchange and simplify but this give black two strong and mobile pawn chains.  I would have played 27. Bb4 rf7 28. d5 heading for d5 to liquidate an important strategic weakness } Rxf6 28. b4 {The idea is to stop the queen side pawn storm but black has a dagger up his sleave. Best to me is 28. Rxf6 gxf6 29. Then b4} Rxf1+ {!! Black seizes the initiative and with all of white's pieces on the back rank black may have time to convert his space advantage into a winning one} 29. Nxf1 e5 {actives the bishop and ensures that d3 remains a long term weakness. } 30. a3 {white looks ok by sealing the door on the queen side. However, if I can steer this game into a king+pawn ending I have strong wining chances. So I seek to exchange pieces then race to the center with my king. } Rc8 31. Rxc8+ {?? the final nail in the coffin as exchanges benefit black not white. Also with black having retained his LSB the d3-pawn becomes near impossible to defend with a knight. I think the last chance for a draw is Rc3 but even after that white has to play precise chess. } Bxc8 32. Kf2 Ke7 {racing to the centre} 33. Ng3 {This move does two things. First it attacks the h5 pawn and allows the knight to go to e4 where it hopes to stop any advances of the king side pawns. } h4 {forcing the knight to e4 where I plan to trade it off for a easily won king+pawn ending. But strategically it prevents the knight from aiding in the king side defence} 34. Ne4 Bf5 {checking the knight} 35. Kf3 {white tries to defend the knight} Ke6 {Moving closer to the center and bidding time. } 36. Ke3 Bxe4 37. dxe4 {with the king in the center and the extra pawn on the kingside this is a won endgame for black} Kf6 38. Kf3 Kg5 {prevent white from blockading with his king} 39. Ke3 Kh6 {getting out of the way for ...g5} 40. d4 exd4+ 41. Kxd4 g5 42. Kd5 g4 {White will queen too but black has the initiative and will easily gobble up the remaining pawns} 43. e5 h3 {White finally waved the flag here but not without a super effort. }
