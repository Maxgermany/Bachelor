[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C89), Marshall counter-attack, 11...c6"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez opening, which has been heavily analyzed for over 100 years.} a6 {The morphy defense, as black does not fear 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5, because of 5. ... Qd4!, winning back the pawn with advantage.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 {The closed variation, as opposed to opening the game with Nxe4.} 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O {Ducking the king away, giving black the option of playing d6 or d5 on his next move if white obliges with 8. c3} 8. c3 {<smile>} d5 {!  The defining move of the marshall, getting a strong attack for a pawn.} 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxe5 {There goes the pawn...} Nxe5 11. Rxe5 Nf6 {!?  And here comes the attack!  Usual is 11. ... c6!, stronger for top level masters, but for me, I'm happy to play Nf6 with the threats that arise from that!} 12. d4 Bd6 {Where you gonna run to, Rook?} 13. Re1 Ng4 {Threatening, among other things, ... Qh4 and Qxh2 or Qxf2.} 14. h3 {So far, this is all standard.  After 14. ... Qh4 15. Qf3!, we arrive at the position of the Capablanca-Marshall game.  But, since Marshall lost that game, I decided to try a little innovation...} Nxf2 {!? Sacrificing the knight to bring the king into the open!  Is this sound?  Probably not, but it makes for interesting chess!} 15. Kxf2 {The only way to prove a gambit is unsound is to accept it.  White could've transposed back into the main line with 15. Qf3 Qh4, but this forces black to go for it.} Qh4+ 16. Kg1 {Maybe the best chance for defending, although Kf1 might give some chances, too.} Bxh3 {?!  Good lord!  Black is down a whole knight and what am I doing, throwing in a bishop?!  I calculate that after gxf3 Qg3 , white should be in trouble...} 17. gxh3 Qg3+ {Now, you can see that Kf1 on the 16th move would have led to Qxh3  instead of Qg3 , a difference of one move from the game.} 18. Kf1 Qxh3+ {White can move back to g1 now, and Black may need to force a perpetual check, as I don't see a forced mate.} 19. Ke2 {! Going for it.  White calculates that he can defend and win with his material edge.} Rae8+ {The best chance, as Rf-e8  allows white to play Bxf7  strongly in some variations.} 20. Kd2 {Forced.} Qg2+ {The best chance...} 21. Re2 {??  A serious blunder!  Black is struggling after Kd3, but this allows black to take command with...} Bf4+ {!  Now, Kc2 loses the rook, Kd3 leads to 22. Kd3 Qf3 , which ain't pretty, and Ke1 leads to Qg1#!} 22. Kc2 {Kd3 would have made it harder for black to win.} Rxe2+ {Now this has gotta hurt... Black has the unfortunate choice to make of Kd3, which walks into mate, or of something to d2, which is a wreck as well.  For instance, 23. Nd2 Qe4#, 23. Qd2 Rxd2 , or 23. Bd2 Qe4  24. Kc1 Re1!, and white loses his queen at least.  White resigns (0-1)}
