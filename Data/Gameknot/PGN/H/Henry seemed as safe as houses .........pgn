1. d3 {Hi everyone!  Another game with Master Freddy with a result which is becoming only too familiar to me.  I must remember the 5 virtues, Patience, Perseverence, Endurance, Humility and Tolerance.   Here is certainly another taste of humility for jstevens1!  I am determined to last as long as possible against Freddy but I am looking out for opportunities to do more than that - even with my limited knowledge, but here I decide to concentrate on building a fortress for Henry and christen it Fort Joblock.  It seems to hold and I think I have everything covered but alas, Freddy made me think again!  He starts of with d3 which is the Mieses Opening.  I get taken out of the db on the 3rd move so everything for me was trial and error - oh well, enough verbage -here we go!} e5 2. c3 d5 3. d4 exd4 4. cxd4 Bb4+ 5. Bd2 Bxd2+ 6. Nxd2 Nf6 {6. ........ Nf6 - after the exchange of pawns and dsbs I decide to clear the way for castling kingside, but somehow I feel that I ought to keep Freddy guessing as long as possible as to where I should put that kingsize four poster bed for Henry and Glenda and clear the decks on the queenside too.} 7. e3 c6 {7. ......... c6 - this is resembling a QGD Slav Defense.} 8. Bd3 Nbd7 9. Qc2 Qc7 {9. ........... Qc7 - out comes Glenda - hopefully this move to c7 is better judged than last time I played black - here she can eye up h2 and there is always the possibility of putting a horsie on g4.} 10. Ngf3 b6 {10. .......... b6 - Freddy has cleared the way for castling both sides - now where is he gonna put his king.  As the Wicked Witch of the West and his lsb are also eyeing up h7 I had better keep him guessing still!} 11. g4 {11. g4! - Oh, oh - a pawn storm!  Well I am certainly not going to go kingside.  I now follow up my plan and decide that the queenside is the safest place for Henry to be, after all, although my queenside castling position looks a little draughty Henry is flanked by Glenda, Fou Leblanc and a horsie.  Henry will be as safe as houses over there, especially as it seems that Freddy also intends to castle queenside.  I could take the pawn on g4 but then Freddy will only skewer my knight against the g7 pawn.  So I first play h6 then Bb7 and then castle as planned.} h6 12. Rg1 Bb7 13. h4 O-O-O {13. .......... 0-0-0 - as I castle I have this analysis in mind where black is better but Freddy says "Only in your dreams, Jo".  13. h4 O-O-O 14. g5 hxg5 15. Nxg5 Rdf8 16. Bg6 fxg6 17. Ne6 Qd6 18. Nxf8 Qxf8 19. Qxg6 Rxh4 20. Qxg7 Qxg7 21. Rxg7 Rh1  22. Nf1 Ba6 23. Rg8 } 14. a4 {14. a4! - Well confound me!  I don't think that Freddy intends to castle at all, he means to keep his king in the centre!  Well, the centre is fairly locked.  Now, I wonder whether I should have counter-attacked here with 14. ........ Ree8 to prepare a possible knight move to e4 instead of playing a6.  Jury do you agree?} a6 15. b4 b5 16. Rc1 Qb6 {16.  .......... Qb6 - here Freddy thinks that Nb8 or Kb8 are better.  Not sure how, can you the Jury see how?  Please advise.} 17. axb5 axb5 18. Nb3 {18. Nb3 - after an exchange of pawns the a file is wide open and Freddy brings a horsie to possibly place on a5 or c5 - it eventually lands on c5 but more on that later.  I decide to put Henry on b8.  At the moment the a file squares near Henry are covered by Glenda and Fou Leblanc.} Kb8 19. h5 Rdc8 20. Kf1 {20. Kf1 - interesting move - that is to make way for Freddy's other knight to perhaps do a tour de France into my position.} Rhe8 21. Ra1 Kc7 22. Bf5 Rca8 23. Rxa8 Rxa8 {23. ......... Rxa8 - I was feeling pretty smug here - one pair of rooks have been exchanged off and Henry looks safe on c7, but appearances can be deceptive and it is amazing how movement on the other wing will spell doom for Henry.} 24. g5 hxg5 25. Nxg5 {25. Nxg5 - what a transformation a few moves make.  The f7 pawn is under the hammer so I decide to defend it with my rook.  Freddy now exchanges B for Knight.  There are still plenty of white pieces on the board to get Henry however.} Rf8 26. Bxd7 Nxd7 27. Qf5 {27. Qf5 - and now comes the Witch!} Nf6 {27. .......... Nf6? - Here Freddy said that this was a bad move and my defenses were about to crumble - they did in a very spectacular manner.} 28. Nc5 {28. Nc5 - Chaaarge! - In comes one white steed!} Bc8 29. Qf4+ Kd8 30. h6 Nh5 31. Qd6+ {31. Qd6  - the knight move to h5 does not drive the Wicked Witch away, in fact she moves closer.  The rook on f8 is en prise so Henry moves to e8.} Ke8 32. hxg7 Rg8 33. Qe5+ Be6 {33. ......... Be6 - I block a check with Fou Leblanc - Freddy has just announced # in 7.  Here we go again!} 34. Nxf7 Nxg7 35. Rxg7 Rxg7 {35. .......... Rxg7 - even with both white rooks off the board Henry is doomed.  Now Freddy flashes up a checkmate analysis and sets up the conditional moves - at least it puts me out of my misery quickly!} 36. Qxe6+ {36. Qxe6  - #4} Kf8 37. Nd7+ {37. Nd7  - #3} Kg8 38. Nf6+ {38. Nf6  - # next move.  Note that Glenda was en prise to the white knight but Freddy isn't interested in her - Henry is his big prize and on the next move I am about to receive my 5th checkmate from Freddy.  Back to the drawing board!} Kf8 39. Qe8# {}
