1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  Wolfgang (caveman1960) managed to get up into the low 2000s.  Although his rating has fallen below it, after this game I still strongly back him to get back up there.  This game did last into the endgame, a B v N endgame and both our kings went on pawn gobbling missions.  But whose king got in first?  Well, read on or read GA below.  } d5 2. d4 {2. d4 - pretty standard double QP opening following the Reti.} c6 3. c4 {3.c4 - which transposes into a Queen's Gambit Declined.} Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 {5.e3 - opening up Fou Leblanc's diagonal.} Nbd7 6. Qc2 Bd6 7. Be2 {7. Be2 - clearing the decks for Henry to go kingside.} O-O 8. O-O dxc4 9. Bxc4 {9. Bxc4 - pawn trade.} a6 10. Rd1 Qc7 11. e4 {11. e4 - now opening up the diagonal for Fou Lenoir.} b5 12. Be2 {12. Be2 - retreat.} e5 13. Bg5 exd4 14. Rxd4 {14. Rxd4 - another pawn trade.} Re8 15. Rc1 Ng4 16. h3 Nge5 17. Nxe5 Bxe5 18. Rdd1 {18. Rdd1 - after a knight trade another retreat.} h6 19. Be3 {19. Be3 - and another.} Nf6 20. Bf3 Bb7 21. Ne2 {21. Ne2 - looking to put pressure on the c6 pawn.} Rad8 22. b3 Rxd1+ 23. Rxd1 {23. Rxd1 - rook trade.} Rd8 24. Rxd8+ Qxd8 {24. ….. Qxd8 - followed by another.} 25. g3 Qc7 26. Bf4 {26. Bf4 - trying to relieve pressure down the h2 to b8 diagonal.} c5 27. Bg2 Bxf4 28. Nxf4 {28. Nxf4 - bishop trade.} c4 29. Ne2 Qc5 30. Kf1 {30. Kf1 - escaping from a very nasty pin from the BQ so that I can use the f3 pawn to back up the weak e4 pawn.} a5 31. f3 Ba6 32. bxc4 b4 {32. ……. B4 - mmmm, crafty, he does not recapture on c4 due to the fact that he can now pin my knight on e2.  Nasty, nasty!} 33. Ke1 {33. Ke1 - Henry now tries to assist his beloved wife, Glenda in the defense of the queenside.} Qxc4 34. Qxc4 Bxc4 {34. …… Bxc4 - and after the queens have been traded off, my pawn on a2 is en prise.  But there is a way out of this mess.} 35. Nc1 {35. Nc1 - like this.} a4 36. Kd2 Nh5 37. Nd3 {37. Nd3 - Either the g3 or the h3 white pawns is a gonner so I concentrate on liquidating Wolfgang's queenside pawns.} b3 38. axb3 axb3 39. Kc3 {39. Kc3 - king fork!  Yes, Wolfgang's bishop can still back it up along the a2-g8 diagonal but my knight will attack it on the next turn and then the black b pawn will be eliminated.} Bxd3 40. Kxd3 Nxg3 41. Kc3 Kh7 42. Kxb3 {42. Kxb3 - the queenside pawns have been liquidated.  Henry now has a dilemma - should he merely defend the white vulnerable kingside pawns or should Henry counter-attack the black kingside pawns?  Henry, after a long deliberation decides that attack is the best form of defense so he goes for the black kingside pawns.} Kg6 43. Kc4 Kg5 44. Kd5 Nh5 45. Kd6 {45. Kd6 - the heat is on.} Nf4 46. Bf1 {46. Bf1 - this looks to be a reasonable move, activate Fou Leblanc.  This move proves to be a mistake, according to GA.  I should have moved this prelate to h1 instead.} Ng6 47. Kd7 {47. Kd7 - at this stage Wolfgang is really impressed by Henry's move towards his pawns and told me he thought this was making the endgame very interesting.  Nice.} Kf4 48. Ke8 Ne5 {48. ……. Ne5 - Henry is foiled.} 49. Kf8 g5 {49. ……. g5 - and foiled again!} 50. Kg7 h5 {50. ……. h5 - and again!} 51. Kf6 Nxf3 52. Kxf7 {52. Kxf7 - at last Henry is able to capture something, but there are still 2 black pawns left on the board.} Kxe4 53. Kg6 h4 54. Kh5 {54. Kh5 - Henry desperately tries to make forg4 to block the g pawn.  Sadly King Wolfgang puts a stop to this.} Kf4 55. Bg2 Kg3 56. Bf1 Nh2 {56. ……. Nh2! An excellent move - puts Fou Leblanc en prise and now the h3 white pawn may fall next move.} 57. Ba6 g4 58. hxg4 {58. hxg4 - only one black pawn left, but …….} h3 {58. ……. h3 - there is no stopping the remaining black pawn so I now wave the white flag.  Although it is an expert loss at least I livened things up a bit in the endgame and took the fight to my opponent.  Sadly it did not pay off.  Well played Wolfgang, you certainly deserved your Expert status.  Kind regards - Joanne}
