1. e4 {I invite any annotator to prove that my blindness was not correct in that Black should have been able to refute my guess work. thekingni, known as the Tigerofchess on some other chess sites, found a particular player able to guide me through a game while I was playing blindfolded!!!(Not literally!) As you sighted players can see clear enough, I, for one, most times stumble and fumble my way around the chess board, like a blind man seeking his cane! This game, given as an example of my style, or lack of style, as I bump along with only a feel to the ending. I gave up material, kinda sacrificed the queen and ended the game with not much material gain, but as for positional!, well,... see for yourself!!} d6 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 {Just wanted to play a simple opening and not a rip roaring open game.} g6 {Have a small idea that this may be a Pirc?} 4. c3 {Try to now establish a cramping pawn line for the future fianchetto of blacks dsb.} Bg7 5. Nd2 {This is some of the sight unseen.} O-O 6. Ngf3 {Just trying somewhat of a normal opening.} Nc6 {Black has a lead in development.} 7. Ng5 {So, for no for seen reason I move my Knight.} e6 {Oh, yeah, forgot about the f7 attack by my Bishop and Knight!} 8. O-O {Thought this might be best and yet have no real feeling for proceeding.} d5 {GAve reason to place my Bishop farther away.} 9. Bb3 b6 {Was now unsure of the opponents plan.} 10. f4 {Most of these moves were just played as feeling natural to the beginning position.} Re8 {So here I am, lost as to what my opponent was attempting and at what I was attempting to achieve.} 11. e5 {This came to me as being hopeful at keeping the "e" file closed and dsb out of my life.} Nd7 {Now that black seems to be cramped positionally, I complete the pawn blockade.} 12. d4 Na5 13. Ba4 {Most times I see Bc2, so here I push to pin the Knight.} h6 14. Rf3 {This is when I speculate that the time it may take black to unravel his position to defend the king side from attack is suspect, I sacrifice a piece only on that assumption. The blind still walk.} hxg5 15. Rh3 {Now keep with an attack theme. Open lines are a must.} gxf4 16. Qg4 {being down 4 points with only hope for attacking lines, I post up my Queen at the focal point of attack.} c5 {Making room to Queen side counter attack and get some space.} 17. Nf3 {Part of what I saw earlier, if only I could keep a Knight on g5.} cxd4 {Ok, now -5, I must redirect my focus on material gain.} 18. cxd4 Ba6 {I felt that this move was played to help remove the pin I placed him in.} 19. Ng5 {I played this without hesitation -4 and needing the Knight there.} b5 20. Bc2 {Fumbling around and not looking much to this Bishop as part of my initial scheme, this placement had a lurking attack sense to it.} Qb6 {Attacking the d pawn, I did not want or see that these moves were available to for stall the attack process I was hoping for.} 21. Qxf4 {I'm only playing by feel here, seems that is all I can do. At least I'm only down by the piece points that I had sacrificed. Plus an attack to f7 by Queen and Knight.} Re7 {Defending.} 22. Nh7 {Spent lots of time trying to figure how I was going to get my Rook up on the last rank ahead of my Queen, looked at this current position and found other ways in. Of course tripping and falling into it.} Nc5 {A likely return sacrifice to open the g1-a7 diagonal for a space gathering check for his Queen.} 23. Nf6+ {Finding a resource which makes the opponents last move a blunder, therefor guiding the game to these final forced moves. 23. ...Bxf6  24. ef6  R??  25.  Qh4....... or....} Kf8 {This is totally the most clarity I have had in some time due to an opponent who needed space and time for defense.} 24. Qh6 {!! If not than what?!,  !?, !!!....} Ne4 {At this point ANY!} 25. Qh8+ Bxh8 {Forced} 26. Rxh8+ Kg7 {Forced} 27. Rh7+ Kf8 {Forced} 28. Bh6# {So, looking at old Master's games do at times present themselves in the now. Walking with clarity. hmmmmm......}
