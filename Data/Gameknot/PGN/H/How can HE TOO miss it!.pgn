1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 {This N should not be moved there, IMO... not a great deal, but it's much easier to play without c5 from black. } 3. Nf3 e6 {...blocking his own lsb. Good for me.} 4. Nbd2 f5 {This implies I have to play g4 at some point in order to break in. } 5. e3 Nf6 6. h3 Be7 {Still passive... but my edge is already in the air. } 7. c3 O-O {...right into danger. } 8. Bd3 Bd7 9. Rg1 {This is the first "surprise" for him. Not going for castling.} a6 {? Still passive! Good!} 10. g4 fxg4 11. hxg4 Be8 {Finally taking seriously the threates I am creating.} 12. Qc2 g6 13. Ng5 {...aiming to the weak e6, but also eyeing a sac in h7 in the future. } Qd7 14. Ndf3 b5 {Too slow, too late. Now castling queenside is not the priority.} 15. Ne5 {...this goes right into the point. } Nxe5 16. dxe5 Ne4 {...here, I cannot castle because my N is threatened. I thought for a while about Nxh7, KxN, BxN, dxB, Qxe4, threatening Ra8, and Qh1+... but I wasn't sure. Also Rh1+, Kg8 (otherwise Bh6+ wins the exchange), and then trying to sum my Q and the other R into the attack after Ke2. Well, too long a sequence for a blitz game for me. Probably I missed some chance here. } 17. Nxe4 dxe4 18. Bxe4 Rd8 {...but now I can't break into his king's guard so easily. So...} 19. Rd1 Qxd1+ 20. Qxd1 Rxd1+ 21. Kxd1 {...and we enter an endgame, (sort of), with 4 bishops, a pawn and a cramped R for him, which I try to exploit. } c5 {Bb7 doesn't win a pawn.} 22. Ke2 {...but this defends my f2 pawn. You'll see why. } Kg7 {He saw it, and tried to activate his K, guarding h6.} 23. Rh1 Kg8 {Rh8 was better, IMO.} 24. Bh6 Rf7 25. f4 {...his dsb is almost blocked in. The only way to free his R is Bd8. } c4 {...or this, but on c5, his dsb has not much perspectives. Now it's time for a little tactic. } 26. f5 exf5 27. gxf5 gxf5 28. Bd5 {...an exchange is always an exchange. } Kh8 29. Bxf7 Bxf7 {...here Rg1 threatens Rg7, winning one of the two bishops. I didn't see it. Moreover, I blundered. } 30. Rd1 {?? Bh5+ and he gets his quality back. } Be6 {...but he doesn't see it. Bad for both of us. } 31. Kf3 {Now I can improve my K. } Kg8 {Kind of a mistake. It loses h7.} 32. Rg1+ Kf7 33. Rg7+ Ke8 34. Rxh7 Bd5+ {The edge becomes greater. } 35. Kf4 Be4 36. Bg7 {I plan Bf6, and if he takes, my pawn will promote on dark square.} Bc5 37. Rh8+ Kd7 {Useless check, since I can't play Ra8 afterwards. } 38. Rh6 {Trying another plan to advance my pawn. Even if I have a strong edge, it's a kind of edge that I can easily throw away.} a5 39. e6+ Ke7 40. Bd4 {He can't exchange, or my pawns will become monsters. } Bd6+ 41. Be5 Bc5 42. Bc7 {with tempo. } a4 43. Ke5 {...My K helps. I have to choose: keep an eye on e3, or going for a promotion. } Bxe3 44. Rh7+ Ke8 45. e7 Bf2 {...looking for a skewer with Bg3+. Here, Ke6 and the game was over, but nobody's perfect!} 46. Bd6 Kd7 {Ok now or never!} 47. Kf6 {He can't prevent me from promotion!} f4 {If I play Kf7, Bd5+ or BxR and I win all the same. But more precise, IMO, was...} 48. Rh8 {My opp. resigned. Wow, almost a high win! }
