1. a4 {Hi everyone!  This opening is the Meadow Hay Opening and it comes from Easy19's suggestion that I create a themed MT out of this opening.  I ended up playing against a very strong expert in this MT and I seemed to be doing OK.  But then my opponent conjured up Old Matey out of nowhere.  I could have avoided copping this mate but only at the cost of ruinous loss of material.  So, how did this happen?  Firstly I will begin commentary with black's move on Move 4 because that is where the fixed moves end.  The database has completely run out so each player is on their own.} e5 2. a5 d5 3. e3 f5 4. a6 Nxa6 {4. ..... Nxa6 - there are several ways to capture this pawn, either with the b7 pawn or with the knight.  My opponent chooses the knight.} 5. Bxa6 bxa6 {5. .... bxa6 - this B for N trade splits up black's queenside pawns and may facilitate material restoration later on.} 6. b3 {6. b3 - this move prepares a fianchetto on the queenside and a possible move to c4 to try and break up black's strong pawn centre.} Nf6 7. Bb2 Bd6 8. d3 {8. d3 - preparing Nd2.} O-O 9. Ne2 c5 10. O-O {10. 0-0 - with my opponent castled kingside, you wouldn't think I was castling into it, would you?} Bb7 11. Nd2 {11. Nd2 - my development is nearly complete but black has a big spatial edge.  What an impressive wall of black pawns on the 5th rank!} Qe7 12. Re1 Rad8 13. Qc1 Qf7 {13. ..... Qf7 - this is the start of black's dastardly plan.} 14. f3 Qg6 15. Kh1 {15. Kh1 - Henry sidesteps a possible pin, but this is where he will be boxed in!} Kh8 16. Rg1 {16. Rg1 - it seemed such a good idea at the time - line up rook on same file as enemy queen.  Black showed me that this is not always the case!} Qh6 17. Nf1 {17. Nf1 - this knight comes down and protects Henry against mate threats on the h column.  It also protects my vulnerable e3 pawn which is now defended by our poor put upon Glenda!} e4 18. f4 {18. f4 - an attempt to block off the line of attack of black's dsb.} Ng4 {18. ..... Ng4 - allo, allo, allo, suddenly Henry is now in Old Matey's shadow!  Only his dearly beloved better half can defend him now, so Glenda moves to e1 on the next turn.} 19. Qe1 d4 20. Bc1 {20. Bc1 - to bolster e3.  Now comes a plethora of exchanges that turn out to be an unmitigated disaster for Yours Truly.} exd3 21. cxd3 dxe3 22. Bxe3 Rfe8 {23. Qg3?? - I think this was my fatal mistake.  I think Bd2 had to be played here.  Do you the Inquest Jury agree?} 23. Qg3 Rxe3 {23. ..... Rxe3!! a brilliant exchange sac!} 24. Nxe3 Qxh2+ {24. .... Qxh2+!!! - followed by a brilliant queen sacrifice.  Mate cannot be avoided.  Next move I am 9 points up in material but down a king! Sigh and double Sigh!  Not the usual Philidor's Legacy!  Never mind, I did have the consolation over the weekend by managing to add to my tally of Expert Draws with my secret weapon, Operation Joblock.  I will be annotating this game this week so watch this space!  } 25. Qxh2 Nf2# {}
