[Opening "Sicilian (B92), Najdorf, Opovcensky variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {This is the Najdorf variation of the Sicilian Defence. I play it as Black too.} 6. Be2 {I usually play this move. It is less aggressive than many other variations.} e5 {Black kicks the knight away and takes control of the d4-square. The downside is that the d5-square can be weak. Personally, I prefer e6, but that is just a matter of taste.} 7. Nb3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Kh1 {This move might appear overly cautious, but it is useful in many variations not to have the king on the g1-a7-diagonal, especially if the f-pawn moves.} b5 {This move is typical in Najdorf (and many other Sicilian variations). It gains space on the queenside, and the idea is often to play b4 attacking the c3-knight, which protects the e4-pawn. So Black is indirectly attacking the center!} 10. a4 {With this move I am saying: "I am not afraid of b4!" Black cannot really win a pawn (see next move).} b4 {And Black goes for it.} 11. Nd5 {This move is already utilizing the weak d5-square. Black cannot play 11...Nxe4 bacause 12. Bf3 f5 (or if the knight moves 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. Bxa8 or 12...Bf5 13. Qe1 with a similar idea if the knight moves) 13. Bxe4 fxe4 14. Nxe7 Qxe7 15. Qd5+ and Qxa8 wins a rook.} a5 {This move was a surprise to me. I expected Nxd5 or Bb7. Apparently, Black wanted to protect b4.} 12. Nxe7+ {Winning the bishop pair and removing the defender of d6.} Qxe7 13. Bg5 {Developing a bishop and pinning the knight to the queen.} Bb7 {Threatens to take on e4.} 14. f3 {Defending e4.} h6 {Now Black wants to push the bishop to a less favorable square.} 15. Bh4 {Naturally, I want to keep the pin.} g5 {The pin is no longer there, but the pawn shelter in front of the king is weakened. One has to be careful with such moves.} 16. Bf2 {I move the bishop to an open diagonal.} Nbd7 {Natural development.} 17. Bb5 {The bishop did nothing at e2. The drawback of Black's 11th move (a5) is now obvious. He doesn't control the b5-square anymore.} Rac8 {I don't understand this move. The a5-pawn is left without protection. Moving the other rook (17...Rfc8) would have been a good move.} 18. Nxa5 {So I gladly accept the pawn.} Ba8 {Apparently Black doesn't want to trade his only bishop.} 19. Qd2 {Clearing the back rank for the rooks and attacking b4 at once.} d5 {I think this is a good move. It gets rid of a weakness and challenges the control of the center.} 20. exd5 {I had to react. I didn't like either d4 or dxe4 by Black.} Nxd5 {Black has an active knight in the center now.} 21. Rfe1 {The rook was doing nothing at f1. Now it adds pressure on Black's e-pawn.} Nc5 {Moving the knight to a better square.} 22. Nc4 {The knight was poorly placed at a5. Here it is attacking the e5-pawn.} f6 {Guarding the e5-pawn. Black king's position seems even more precarious now, although Black didn't have a good alternative.} 23. Ne3 {I want to get rid of the d5-knight. It is active and protects the b4-pawn.} Rfd8 {Moving the rook to an open file and protecting the knight. However, this loses material. Correct was 23...Nxe3.} 24. Nxd5 {This wins a pawn, but I had an even better move: 24. Bc4! and the knight is hard to protect. For example, 24...Qf7 25. Red1 Ne6 26. Bxd5 Bxd5 27. Nxd5 Nf4! The best defence, because the knight is pinned to the queen, so it is lost. However, I can win two pawns: 28. Nxf6+ Qxf6 29. Qxb4 Rxd1 30. Rxd1 and now not 30...Rxc2 31. Qb3+ forking. All this was too difficult to me to find during the game. Only computer analysis after the game revealed this line.} Rxd5 {Capturing with the rook and threatening the queen.} 25. Qxb4 {Black loses another pawn. However, I could have played Bc4 here, because then the rook is pinned to the king.} Rdd8 {Another move that is a mystery to me. The rook was not threatened, so why did it back up?} 26. Rad1 {I want to exchange more pieces, because I am ahead in material.} Rxd1 {Black accepts the trade.} 27. Rxd1 {The d-file is now under my control. Black cannot easily challenge it with Rd8, because the rook has to protect the c5-knight, which in turn cannot move, because the queen at e7 is not protected.} Qc7 {The queen moves away from e7, allowing the knight to move.} 28. Qc4+ {The queen moves to a square from which it can more easily participate in an attack.} Kg7 {Actually, 28...Kh8 would have been better.} 29. h4 {This was not a good move. 29. Bxc5 was winning, because Black cannot take back: 29...Qxc5 30. Rd7+ Kg6 (30...Kh8 31. Qf7 and checkmate follows) 31. Qf7+ Kf5 32. Rd3! and the threat of Bd7+ is deadly, for example: 32...e4 33. Bd7+ Ke5 34. Qe6+ Kf4 35. g3#. It is quite annoying that I missed this opportunity, although I saw a similar idea a few moves later.} e4 {Black could have traded a piece for two pawns: 29...Ne4 30. Qxc7+ Rxc7 31. fxe4 Rxc2 32. Kg1 Rxb2 (or Bxe4). Considering the fact the a-, b-, and c-pawns are all passed pawns, that could have been a fair trade.} 30. Bxc5 {This is still winning.} Qxc5 {But Black won't be checkmated after taking back.} 31. Rd7+ {Now the king is in real danger.} Kg6 {All other moves lead to a quick checkmate. For example, 31...Kh8 32. Qf7! and there is nothing Black can do.} 32. Qf7+ {This check forces the king to the center of the board.} Kf5 33. fxe4+ {Stripping the king naked.} Bxe4 {Relatively best.} 34. c3 {A blunder. I threw away the win. The c-pawn was not important, but the safety of my king was. Correct was 34. Re7! Qxc2 35. Bd7+ Kf4 36. Qxf6+ Ke3 (36...Kg3 37. Qe5+ Kf2 38. Qd4+ Ke1 39. Rxe4+ and checkmate follows after Black gives up his queen) 37. Qf3+ Kd4 38. Qxe4+ Qxe4 39. Rxe4 Kxe4 40. Bxc8 with an elementary win.} Qf2 {Black finds one of the drawing moves. A checkmate and a perpetual check are threatened and I cannot defend against both of them.} 35. Rd5+ {Objectively, I should have played 35. Rd2! Qxh4+ 36. Kg1 Qe1+ 37. Kh2 Qh4+ and so forth, but not 37...Qxd2 which lets me back into the game: 38. Qd7+ Qxd7+ 39. Bxd7+ Ke5 40. Bxc8 with a pawn up. The move played in the game sets up a little trap.} Bxd5 {Black falls for the trap. Correct was 35...Kg4! 36. Qd7+ f5 37. Rd2 Bxg2+! 38. Kh2 Qg3+! 39. Kg1 Bc6+ and I lose my queen.} 36. Qxd5+ {Now I can play to win.} Kg6 {Relatively best.} 37. Bd3+ {This does not lead anywhere. The winning move was 37. Qe4+! f5 38. Qe6+ Kg7 39. Qd7+ Kg6 40. Qxc8 Qxh4+ 41. Kg1 Qe1+ 42. Bf1 Qe3+ 43. Kh1 and Black runs out of checks. This is just an example, but other lines are similar. The idea is to pick the c8 rook with queen checks and move the bishop to f1 after Qe1+.} Kh5 {This is the only move that doesn't lose. I saw this already when I played Rd5+, but I thought I would be able to find something against it. Wishful thinking doesn't help to win chess games.} 38. Qf7+ {Again a bad move. 38. Qe6 would have kept the game going on for a while.} Kxh4 {Now I don't have checks, and my king is starting to feel uncomfortable.} 39. Qe6 {What else?} g4 {Winning. Black can afford to leave the rook without protection. Moving my queen away from protecting the e1-square leads to checkmate.} 40. Qe2 {Desperate moves continue.} Qxe2 {This might be a practical move, but 40...Kg3 was even better. The idea is to bring the rook to the attack via d8. It would threaten to take the bishop at d3 followed by checkmate or to play the rook to the second rank. There is nothing I could do against this plan.} 41. Bxe2 Kg3 {This is still winning.} 42. Kg1 {I wanted the king out of the corner.} h5 {Black brings in a pawn.} 43. a5 {Trying to advance a passed pawn. Perhaps Black falls asleep and forgets it.} h4 {Here it comes.} 44. a6 {Pushing it.} h3 {It looks like my king has to go back to the corner soon.} 45. gxh3 {Exchange one pair of pawns.} gxh3 46. c4 {Pushing another pawn.} h2+ {The corner awaits.} 47. Kh1 {Forced.} Re8 {It is time to resign.}
