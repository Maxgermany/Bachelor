1. e4 {Despite the fact that I'm not Capablanka yet ...(ooops... :-)...but I could admire in this great master just only for his priority to play  e2 - e4... } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {Four Knight Game.What's next - Bc4, d4,Be2 or Bb5?  Come on!} 4. Nxe5 {One year ago I've  played a blitz game against Dutchman and after his 4.Nxe5 I thought he was joking and in 5 minutes ... I was beaten unmercifully.That guy explained me that he was playing the Halloween Attack in Four Knight Game.And made an advice - if you want to reach a   - position after few moves against a strong player then play the Halloween attack. And I did that a lot of times.And sometimes it works, especially playing fast games...} Nxe5 {My opponent accepts that. It's ok.} 5. d4 {As usual.} Ng6 {I do not know which one is better - Ng6 or Nc6.We're taking into consideration that my opponent accepted this attack, otherwise there are a few other good moves.Let's see.} 6. e5 {Back to the roots line?} Ng8 {That's fine.Though me prefer if opponent plays Qe7.Next pls..} 7. Bc4 {Maybe much better than Qf3 (I'm afraid Nh4)} d5 {Now the essential moves. 7. ...d5? Quite good, I think.But there are a few much better...;-) } 8. Bxd5 {If Nxd5, 8. ... Be6} c6 9. Bb3 Be6 {Maybe the best.} 10. Be3 Bb4 11. O-O {Bxe6 was very attractive} Bxc3 12. bxc3 {I'm feeling very comfortably.} Ng8e7 13. Bg5 h6 {I waited 0-0 or Qd7.} 14. Bxe7 Nxe7 15. Bxe6 fxe6 {I like black e pawn now.} 16. Qh5+ {Trying to keep "under pressure"} g6 17. Qg4 Qd7 18. c4 O-O 19. Rab1 Rf5 {I don't like my f line..} 20. a3 Raf8 {I was waiting this one, or c5.Both are quite unaffable...} 21. c3 Rg5 22. Qe4 Kg7 23. f4 { f4!?? I muff g4.. :( } Rgf5 24. g4 {Now it's too late - Rf3 is better.F line becomes quite important.Headlong.. :)} Rf5f7 25. Rf2 {a4 was necessary here - what I can do after 25. ... b5? } g5 {ooops...It's time to breath again..} 26. f5 exf5 27. e6 fxe4 28. Rxf7+ {Not exd7,of course} Rxf7 {Just one move now.} 29. exd7 Rf8 30. Rxb7 Kf7 31. Rxa7 Ke6 32. a4 e3 {Very dangerous neigbour.} 33.

Kf2 e1=N {My opponent prefers Knight too, but there are no differences in this case..} 36. Kxe1 Ra8 37. d5+ cxd5 38. Rb6+ Ke5 39. cxd5 Nxd5 {I set my hopes on Kxd5 to move h4 later.Unfortunately.It looks that the game is coming to an end and the result could be not possitive to me..:)} 40. Rxh6 Rxa4 41. h4 Kf4 {Much easy now..} 42. hxg5 Nxc3 43. g6 Kg5 {Respire..} 44. g7 Ra8 45. Rh8 {Now Ra1 and later Ne4.} Kg6 {Crucial move.} 46. Rxa8 Kxg7 47. Kf2 Kg6 48. Ra5 Ne4+ 49. Ke3 Nf6 50. Kf4 Ne8 51. Ra6+ Kf7 52. Kf5 Ng7+ 53. Ke5 Kg8 54. g5 Nh5 55. Rh6 Ng7 56. g6 Ne8 57. Rh7 Ng7 58. Kf6 Ne8+ 59. Ke7 Ng7 60. Kd7 Nf5 61. Ke6 {What's Knight! I'm tired and just walking around.} Ng7+ 62.

Ra7 Kf8 71. g7+ {I found that Halloween works much better playing blitz games.Sometimes I win against players with high ELO.But here...I understand that there are a lot of good moves for black,but when I see all 4 knigts at the beginning of a game ...I can't make move  excepting 4.Nxe5... :) I thankful to my opponent from Poland for this game.This is my first annotated game,therefore I beg your pardon for mistakes or amateurity...if any...:-)...  Sincerely, Karolis  }
