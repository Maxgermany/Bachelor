[Opening "Two knights defence (C57)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {This marks the two knights opening for the game (well, I think it does - correct me if I'm wrong) as White in this position, I like Black to play either this move or Bc5 (which marks the Giuoco Piano, where I would try out the Evans Gambit with b4)} 4. Ng5 {There are some ways Black can answer to this threat; 4...d5, gaining centre control and blocking the attack on f7; 4...Bc5, the Traxler variation (I was half hoping that my opponent would play that because of the mini-tournament I'm in) and, checking the Database, there's even 4...Nxe4, sacrificing a knight to relieve the pressure (as much as I love sacrifices though, I wouldn't be comfortable with this particular one)} Rg8 {? Definitely not this move, though. I guess Black only saw Nxf7 when he made this move (though it still loses in the exchange because of 4.Nxf7 Qe7 5.Nd6+) } 5. Bxf7+ Ke7 6. Bxg8 Nxg8 {and now Black is down three points, with no compensation for the lost material (in fact, he's worse off, with all but the knight undeveloped and his own king hindering the development of his Queen and bishop)} 7. b3 {I don't know why I didn't take the h-pawn straight away...} Ke8 {but when the knight was threatened, I happily went along with the plan} 8. Nxh7 Bc5 {development, and threatening to regain the lost material with Qh4! (White loses his knight as he has to protect against the mating threat) my next move stops that, but I didn't see Qh4... } 9. d4 {! I saw the chance to attack! Of course, Black has to deal with the threat of the pawn to stop more material from being lost...} Nxd4 {but that gives Black no time to protect himself from the next threat...(I'd say, though, that this was the best capture for Black, threatening a fork should White move his queen)} 10. Qh5+ {the attack begins!} Ke7 {my knight also takes part in this attack; Black would have dearly loved to have played Kf8, as it is much safer, but this move is now the only move available thanks to the knight} 11. Bg5+ {This was the reason for White's d4 earlier on} Nf6 {forced, if Black wants to preserve his queen} 12. Nxf6 {this actually wins another piece, as gxf6 is met with 13.Bxf6+ Kxf6 14.Qh4+, winning the queen. I had actually set up a load of conditional moves for this scenario, but none of them are activated because of...} Nxc2+ {logical now I see it - Black needs to counterattack to have a chance in this game. But White had an interesting counter to this...} 13. Ke2 {but doesn't see it; Kd2 was what I had in mind. I say interesting instead of crushing because after 13...gxf6 [best move now] 14.Bxf6+ Kxf6 15.Qh4+ {the king moves} 16.Qxd8 Nxa1 {the knight moves} 17...Nxb3 axb3, and it's 6 points in the favour of White making it all some sort of crazy trade (which favours White, of course) I think I was just afraid of an attack from the bishop} Kd6 {Black saves his queen...} 14. Rd1+ {but White continues the attack!} Nd4+ {?! It gives Black tempo, but it gives up the attack on the rook} 15. Kd3 {Wanting to keep the pressure on Black} gxf6 {now that the threat on the queen is gone, the knight can now safely be captured} 16. Be3 {I could have played Qh6, but I didn't want an excuse to give the Black queen to move. Besides, this move forces a trade} b6 {trying to get his light square bishop into play} 17. Bxd4 Ba6+ {Which he does, with a check to boot} 18. Kc2 {The best square to retreat to, which doesn't block the rook and doesn't allow Black any more checks} Bxd4 {I'm not concerned for my rook here because of the pin on the king... Black's bishops here, though, are well placed where they are, controlling the centre part of the board} 19. f4 {Black can't retake because of Qd5+, winning the bishop} c5 {Black wisely gives extra protection to the bishop} 20. fxe5+ fxe5 {pawn trade - I considered Qg6, but couldn't see it turning into a successful attack} 21. Nc3 {my other knight comes out to play} Kc6 {I guess this was more of a waiting move than anything...} 22. a4 {my knight's protecting the b5 square for now, but this move does serve its purposes later} Qf6 {finally bringing his queen out into play} 23. Nd5 {forces the queen to move (I suspect Black planned to move her anyway) and stops a possible continuation that could have been deadly} Qf2+ {more of a spite check really...} 24. Rd2 {since Black won't get anything from it (but if it weren't for the knight, Black could continue with 24...Qe3!, with a potentially devastating attack)} Qf8 25. Qg6+ {launching another attack on the king (and the a pawn proves its usefulness, because in this situaltion Black might have been safer with Kb5)} d6 {I was expecting 25...Kb7 26.Qd6 Qd8, at which point White would start advancing either the g or h pawn (Black's king is trapped, and once the pawns reach promotion they can't be recaptured with the queen because of Qc7 mate) } 26. Qh7 {there's still a mating threat for White, though} Qd8 {I was expecting Black to defend with the rook here (and probably cost him the game later on, as you will see)} 27. g4 {I start to move my pawn towards promotion, but miss an obvious move from Black; one that I shouldn't have overlooked, and one which Black must have been itching to play since move 23...} Bxa1 {But although this gets Black ahead in material for the first time in the game, it relinquishes centre control... } 28. Rf2 {and I take advantage of that! (I'm not going to take credit for allowing this sacrifice on purpose) White can nw launch a fresh attack} Rb8 {this move saves the rook from...} 29. Rf8 {(!) This! Of course, Black can't recapture with the queen because of Qc7 mate} Rb7 {and Black launches a counterattack, offering a queen trade (and I would have accepted it too - if it wasn't for that meddling bishop! without the bishop; 30.Rxd8 Rxh7 31.Rc8+ Rc7 32.Rxc7# )} 30. Qf5 {keeping that mating threat alive, with a threat on the queen. There is only one reasonable options for the queen, but results in a loss of material; 30...Qd7 31.Rc8+ Qc7 32.Qe6 Rb8 33.Qe8+ Kb7 and Black can (only just) stay in this [this was a complicated series of moves though - I might have made a mistake here, or overlooked better moves] } Qh4 {Black gives up here, but lets me play out the mating sequence} 31. Rc8+ {Qc8+ recieves the same results} Rc7 32. Rxc7# {and (in my opinion) a very pretty mate finishes the game off. entertaining game! :)}
