[Round "1"]
[White "Richard Reti (2650)"]
[Black "Alexander Alekhine (2775)"]
[Opening "Benko's opening (A00), reversed Alekhine"]

1. g3 {Reti was one of the founding members of the "Hypermodern" approach to chess (and in particular, opening theory). Delayed control of the center by setting up flank attacks is the foundation of this theory.} e5 {A "Classical" response, staking a claim in the center.} 2. Nf3 {Unusual and provacative. Reti is enticing Alekhine to push his e pawn.} e4 {Alekhine obliges.} 3. Nd4 {This knight is now roaming the board unsupported (not entirely unusual in the "hypermodern" train of thought).} d5 {Black supports e4 and now apparently owns the middle of the board. He must be careful of over-reaching, however, as white was obviously planning to conduct flank attacks anyway.} 4. d3 {! An attempt to undermine black's strong central pawns.} exd3 {?! Alekhine gives up his advanced e pawn, and control of the middle. I guess the "Classical" theme wasn't for him either......} 5. Qxd3 {Apparently, Reti didn't want to open up the e file by playing 5. exd.} Nf6 {Attempting to catch up in development.} 6. Bg2 {Logical.} Bb4+ {? In post mortem, Alekhine admitted this move was a mistake. In analysis, he preferred 6...c5. With this move and whites response, black basically trades a "better" bishop for a "good" one.} 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 O-O 9. c4 {! Reti gets agressive. By mixing it up in this fashion, Reti declares that he will be the one to control the flow of this game. Even Alekhine gave this move a "!".} Na6 {Black is looking to play Nc5 or Nb4 winning some tempo at the white queens expense.} 10. cxd5 Nb4 {Hitting the queen and d5.} 11. Qc4 Nbxd5 12. Nd2b3 {This knight now anchors it's comrade on d4.} c6 {Almost forced (to preserve the strength of of his Nd5)} 13. O-O Re8 {With the plan of owning the weakened e file.} 14. Rfd1 {Rook to open file. I'm reminded of the old saying "When given the choice of which rook to move, spend extra time analysing every possible ensuing continuation. Evaluate the strength of every piece. Figure out which rook will do the most good on the open file. Then move the other one:)"} Bg4 {Strong developing move, which prevents white from moving his e pawn.} 15. Rd2 {Maintaing the d file, while protecting e2 and allowing it to move.} Qc8 {Alekhine is looking to dominate the light squares.} 16. Nc5 {Clearing room for the b pawn to start advancing.} Bh3 {And here is where my meager analysis hits a brick wall. Numerous GM's agree that at this point, the game should be drawn. By making this move, Alekhine is preparing himself for drinks in the hotel bar, followed by chasing some frauleins. He sees that if white plays 17. BxB, he will play 17...QxB and then maneuver to play his Ng4, threatening mate on h2.} 17. Bf3 {Reti sees this as well, and sidesteps.} Bg4 {"C'mon Richard! I'll buy the first round!"} 18. Bg2 {"Not on your life Alex....I say we play on."} Bh3 {"But I want DRINKS!"} 19. Bf3 {"You're going to have to beat me. I won't just tamely surrender a draw."} Bg4 {"OK! DRAW! This position has been repeated three times! Can we PLEASE get some liquor now?" At this point, Alekhine had actually gotten up and put on his coat. He signed his score sheet and gave it to the arbiter. Just as he is about to walk out of the room, Reti informs the arbiter that the position has only been repeated TWICE, and that he wishes to play on. A huge shouting match between Alekhine and Reti follows. Reportedly, after MUCH nose to nose screaming at each other, Alekhine is convinced by the arbiter that the game must continue. As they are sitting down again, Alekhine tells Reti "Once you retreat your bishop to g2, I will move my bishop to h3 and THEN this game will be drawn!" The clocks are restarted and then Reti plays...................} 20. Bh1 {?! Perhaps feeling compelled to further anger the World Champion. Now the REAL question must be asked. Is it possible that the reigning World Champion wouldn't know if a position had been repeated three times? Or was this whole episode merely a psychological ploy to get Reti to move his bishop to h1 (which makes a number of the tactics that follow possible)? We will never know for sure, but the attack that follows is simply brilliant.} h5 {! Alekhine goes for the jugular.} 21. b4 {An attempt to undermine the strength of black's pawns on the queenside.} a6 {Defensive.} 22. Rc1 {Loading up on the c file.} h4 {Alekhine is already committed, so he presses on.} 23. a4 hxg3 24. hxg3 Qc7 {Fritz gives white a small advantage here.} 25. b5 axb5 {Virtually forced.} 26. axb5 Re3 {!! TWO exclamations! [27. fxR Qxg  28. Kf1 Bh3 #] A BRILLIANT move!} 27. Nf3 {? The majority of GM's in my research questioned this move, although it does sort of just "feel" right. Tactics abound from this point forward.} cxb5 {Fritz now gives black a solid edge.} 28. Qxb5 Nc3 {! Forking the white queen and the e pawn.} 29. Qxb7 {White sees his e pawn about to fall, and shoots for material equality.} Qxb7 30. Nxb7 Nxe2+ {! White has maintained his material equality, but now has to contend with this nasty fork on his king and rook.} 31. Kh2 {Forced, as 31. Kf1 fails to 31...Bh3 .} Ne4 {!! Not bothering with a "free" rook, Alekhine reloads and comes out with both barrels blazing! Kasparov called this "one of the greatest queenless attacks ever".} 32. Rc4 {Reti's rook takes advantage of the last minute reprieve, and moves to a strong position.} Nxf2 {! Alekhine picks up the pawn advantage and complicates things further. Anyone care to work out all of the possible continuations from here? :)} 33. Bg2 Be6 {! Alekhine attacks Reti's Rc4, while clearing g4 for his knight to deliver check, driving the white king to the 1st rank where it will be met by another check from his Ra8.} 34. Rcc2 Ng4+ 35. Kh3 {Reti sees the danger of moving his king to the 1st rank, and voluntarily walks right into a discovered check!} Ne5+ 36. Kh2 Rxf3 {! One last tactical shot by the Champion! If white retakes, another nasty fork is his reward!} 37. Rdxe2 {Practically forced, if white wants to gain anything!} Ng4+ {! Inviting white to walk into that discovered check AGAIN!} 38. Kh3 Ne3+ 39. Kh2 Nxc2 40. Bxf3 Nd4 {! And a final fork! White will lose a piece after 41. Rf2 NxB  42. RxB Bd5 (forking the Rf3 and the Nb7)! Reti resigned at this point. True to his intentions, Alekhine had those drinks afterwards, and I'm sure he had a good laugh at Reti's expense. It simply blows my mind how deep into a position these top level GM's can see. Supposedly Alekhine pictured this situation after his 32nd move (eight moves deep). While analyzing eight moves deep is certainly strong, it is not unheard of even for strong club level players. The thing is, how many club players could make that calculation with SO MANY tactical options available? It's one thing to count squares while you are pushing a passed pawn up the a file while your opponent pushes his passed pawn down the h file, but the calculation required in this game was much, much deeper (and far more beautiful). I hope you have enjoyed this game:) - Thomas}
