[Opening "Blackmar gambit (D00)"]

1. d4 {I had white pieces and started with d4.} d5 {d5 was my friend's response.} 2. e4 {e4, blackmar diemer gambit. } dxe4 {black accepts the gambit pawn. } 3. Nc3 {Nc3, white is trying to get the pawn back.} Nf6 {Nf6 is a very sensible move, develops the knight and defend the pawn.} 4. f3 {f3 challenging black pawn.} exf3 {exf3, black wants to maintain the material advantage.} 5. Qxf3 {normally white would capture with knight, Qxf3 leaves the d4 pawn unprotected, but white is actually setting up the trap, d4 pawn is the bait.} Qxd4 {my friend was a bit greedy and took the bait. } 6. Be3 {Be3 develops the dsb, also attacks black queen.} Qb4 {Qd8 looks embarrassing, but that would be a better move than the move played in the game, which is Qb4, attacks the b2 pawn. it seems like white can't castle queen side, because O-O-O results in Bg4, skewers the queen and the rook on d1. } 7. O-O-O {O-O-O was played anyway.} Bg4 {Here comes the skewer! is white in trouble now, maybe my friend thought I would resign after this move.} 8. Nb5 { Nb5 was played! Did white commit suicide? Not really! Can you see black's problem? if black captures the queen, then Nxc7# !} e6 {Black actually saw the problem, and played e6, now Nxc7 won't be mate.} 9. Qxb7 {Qxb7} Qe4 {my friend realized he was in trouble, Qe4, protects the rook on a8, also hopes queen exchange. } 10. Nxc7+ {No thanks, no queen exchange for you my friend, Nxc7+} Ke7 {Ke7 is the only move} 11. Nd5+ {Nd5+, discovered and double check!} Kd8 {Kd8, now there is mate in two} 12. Qc7+ {begins with Qc7+ } Ke8 {Ke8 only move} 13. Qc8# {Here is mate! At move 11, black can play Kd6, but Qc6 would be checkmate. Halosar trap worked! That's all about this game, hope you like it, thank you!}
