1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 Bxb4 {Lange, never afraid, accepts the gambit.} 5. c3 Ba5 6. d4 {Von Rothschild plays the standard line.} exd4 7. O-O {Von Rothstein postpones the recapture by a move in order to castle.} Bb6 8. cxd4 d6 {Lange begins opening lines for counterattack.} 9. d5 Na5 {Attacking the B.} 10. Bb2 Ne7 11. Bd3 O-O {Lange tucks his own King safely away.} 12. Nc3 {Clearing the last minor piece.} Bg4 {Countering with a pin.} 13. Be2 {Unpinning at once.} Bxf3 {Capturing anyway.} 14. gxf3 {A mistake. Von Rothschild should have recaptured with the B instead of opening up his K's position.} Ng6 {Lang immediately prepares to exploit this error, opening a line for his Q.} 15. Qd2 {With the doubled KBP's, von Rothschild cannot get his pieces quickly to the threatened sector.} Qh4 {With his B and Q targeting the K-side and the Knight prepared to leap into the fray, Lange ratchets up the pressure.} 16. Na4 {Trying to remove the B from the attacking equation.} Nf4 {Lange rightly ignores this, as the Knight and Queen are sufficient force against the undefended King.} 17. Nxb6 {Getting rid of the Bishop...} Qg5+ {...but not accounting for the Queen.} 18. Kh1 {Forced.} Qg2# {Nicely done.}
