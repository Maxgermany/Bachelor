1. c4 {The second in my series of disastrous oversights, this one shows the power of the diagonal.  I've recently been experimenting with the English so I decided to carry on in this game } c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. e4 {I'm not overly familiar with e4 here so I decided to give it a go} Nc6 5. Be2 {I'm not sure it wouldn't have been better to fianchetto my lsb} b6 6. O-O Bb7 7. d3 {Adding protection to e4} Qc7 8. Bg5 {Looking to delay Bd6 as I figured black was looking to castle kingside and wouldn't want his pawns disrupted} Be7 9. Qd2 O-O 10. d4 {Hoping for, though not expecting to be able to push this pawn to d5} cxd4 11. Nxd4 Nxd4 12. Qxd4 Bc5 13. Qd3 Ne8 14. Rab1 {Looking to boot the black dsb away with b4} h6 15. Bh4 Bd6 16. Nb5 {Intended as a distraction from the threat of Bxh2, Bg3 looks better now} Bxh2+ 17. Kh1 {black is now forced to move his queen which means I can grab his dsb, possibly by g3 first.} Qf4 18. g3 {Whites position is pretty precarious now, black is threatening Bxe3 gaining the white queen} Qxe4+ 19. Kxh2 {This is my fatal blunder, although I had seen the possibility of Qh1, I managed to totally overlook the equally obvious Qg2. Better here would have been to exchange queens then I could have grabbed blacks dsb for the loss of my rook on b1.  Thanks for reading please comment} Qg2# {}
