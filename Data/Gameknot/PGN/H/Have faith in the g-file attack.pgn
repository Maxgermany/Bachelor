1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Nxf6+ gxf6 6. c3 {I'm not convinced that move's valuable. Seems like he's better off developing pieces. Unless he was worried about Qa5+.} Bf5 7. Bc4 e6 {These are all standard moves so far. This move blocks his bishop from my vulnerable f7 pawn, it makes it harder for his pawn to move up to d6, and it gives mt KB a way out.} 8. Qf3 Nd7 9. Ne2 h5 10. O-O Nb6 11. Bb3 Bg4 {I imagine his knight wants to go to g3 (or maybe f4). From g3, it makes my bishop move again, so I might as well move it now and force his queen to run around a little, too. Plus, that bishop is usually a difficult piece to deal with in this opening for Black, so he's eventually going to get traded for that knight on e2, I predict.} 12. Qe4 Bd6 13. h3 f5 14. Qe3 Bxe2 15. Qxe2 Qf6 16. d5 {Wow, that's a really good move that causes me trouble, no matter what I do.  If I capture with the knight, he's going to play Qb5+ and have a strong attack. So it looks like cxd5. I think that he'll play Be3, threatening to take the knight and also threatening Be5.} cxd5 17. Qb5+ Kf8 18. Be3 Rg8 {I feel like I keep getting into positions like this when I play this defense. White invades on the queenside and makes things very difficult for me, but I end up with an overwhelming attack down the g-file (and h-file sometimes) if I stick with it.} 19. Bxb6 Qe5 {Here's my chance to get the queen to a better square. I expect f4 to block the threat, and then I'll play Qe4 to threaten Qxg2#. After that, I'll play axb6 with threats of Bxf4 and Bc5. } 20. f4 Qe4 21. Rf2 axb6 {The conditional move I left for him here is Qxb6  Bxf4; Qxb7  Rb8.} 22. Qxb6 Bxf4 23. Qc5+ Kg7 {So he didn't want the pawn. That's fine, I already wanted to get my king off of the back row so my rooks can be connected and also get it to the h-file so I still have rook threats on his king. He has to be very careful. I've got threats with Be3, but if he uses Rf3 to stop that, he has to worry about Rxg2+ (after I move the king to h7 or h6 or even h8) and then the other rook comes over with a check.} 24. Rf3 Kh7 25. Raf1 Rg5 {Rxg2+ doesn't seem to do any good as a sacrifice. So let's double the rooks first, and then I can go down and take that pawn.} 26. Qe7 {I think his best defense was to retreat to Qf2.} Rag8 27. Kh1 Rg8g7 28. Qxg5 {I think that move finishes him off.} Rxg5 29. a4 Be3 30. Re1 f4 31. Bd1 Qb1 32. h4 Rg3 33. Rff1 Qxb2 34. Re2 Qxc3 35. Kh2 {}
