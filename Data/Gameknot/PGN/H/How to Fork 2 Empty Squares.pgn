1. e4 c5 {Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nc3 {Closed.} Nc6 {Traditional Line.} 3. Bb5 Nd4 4. Bc4 e6 5. Nge2 Nf6 6. O-O {All book moves to this point.} d5 {Premature pawn break, a6 should have been played first.} 7. exd5 exd5 {Nxd5 is best for black, as it resists white's objective of opening the king's file.} 8. Nxd4 {A little bit dodgy.  Nxd5 would have been better, eventually Qh5 either wins back the piece or starts a black king march.  However, white is trying to open the king file as quickly as possible.  Also hoping to entice black into his next move.} cxd4 {Almost as dodgy.  At a quick glance it appears that black has pawns attacking white's remaining knight and a bishop, winning a piece.  How could that go wrong?  It does.  Better would have been dxc4.} 9. Re1+ Be6 {Black interposes with the wrong piece.  Had he anticipated the next move he would have played Be7.} 10. Bb5+ {Moving one of the attacked pieces with tempo which is why black's 8th move does not win a piece.  And now we see why a6 should have been played before d5.  It would have eliminated this option for white.  Black's last move pinned his light square bishop to his king rendering it unavailable for interposition duty.  So he must either move his king or interpose his knight.  Okay, the queen can interpose too, but that would be silly.  So if black had played Be7 last move he could play Bd7 here, developing another piece instead of moving a developed piece a second time.  He also would have the option of castling on his next move, freeing his pinned pieces.} Nd7 {And now 2 of black's pieces are pinned to his king.  Probably Ke7 was better.} 11. Qh5 {It would be tempting for white to play Nxd5 here, but he found a better move.  He pins the f-pawn and threatens to take the bishop with check (Rxe6+).} g6 {Why not dxc3?  That was the best move black had, but white would have replied Rxe6+, which apparently made black uncomfortable.  So he avoids that and allows something worse.} 12. Qe5 Rg8 {Big mistake.  Again dxc3 was best, but it keeps getting worse.} 13. Nxd5 {And here is why black should have captured that knight while he had the chance.  White's knight is threatening to either go to c7 forking black's king and rook, or go to f6 forking black's king and other rook.  So here we have a fork of 2 empty squares!} Rc8 {Even bigger mistake!  At least that rook was protected, so black was only losing the exchange.  This loses the other rook with no compensation.  Be7 was best.} 14. Nf6+ Ke7 {Believe it or not, Qxf6 was better, but not by much.} 15. Nxg8+ Ke8 16. Nf6+ Ke7 {Here Qxf6 is definitely not better.  That would have been like closing the barn door after the horse is gone.} 17. Bxd7 Rc7 {Bg7 was best for black.} 18. Bxe6 Bg7 {Now Bg7 is a horrible blunder.  If you are wondering why not 18... fxe6?  then 19. Qxe6#!  Qd6 was best for black.} 19. Bd7+ Kf8 20. Qe8+ Qxe8 21. Rxe8# {Well at least black didn't suffer long.}
