1. c4 {I relay hate when white opens with a Queen's gambit.. (i usually have a large draft in the center or cant move at all.. usually bad for me)} e5 2. e4 Nf6 3. d3 {i have been told this move is out of opening book (but he forgot to mention which move is "by the book")} Bc5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Nc3 {so far so good} O-O 6. Bg5 h6 {i like positions with black Q on f6 or b6 but i am poor in cramped positions.. if he takes my knight it could bee bad for me} 7. Bxf6 {yep :)} Qxf6 8. Nd5 Qd8 9. Be2 d6 {my idea here was to trade Bc8 for Nf3 so that i can place my horsey on d4.. i didn't notice that i will cramp my other bishop} 10. O-O Bg4 11. a3 {a crap.. now i noticed the pawn move b4.. well probably a5 on the next move will deal with it.. } Bxf3 12. Bxf3 a5 {ok.. preparations are done.. my idea is to place the N on critical d4 square, chase of the white N with a move like c6, and later on (probably) exchange the Nights on d4 square and place a bishop there.. (quite a good plan if might add.. noone can chase him away and he will be a constant treat on f2 pawn and white king safety)} 13. Ra2 {was not sure what to think about this move.. } Nd4 14. Bg4 c6 15. Nc3 g6 {my idea here (probably will make some ppl laugh now) was to play next Kg7 and than e5, maybe next exchange pawn on e4 and maybe make some barage of rooks on f file (or something like that.. i have limited depth lol)} 16. Na4 {my bishop is good... well he is good if i move my knight.. well i don't want to exchange because i am stuck in my "plan"} Ba7 17. Nc3 f5 {um.. didn't i moved the king 1th :D  hmm.. well this way i have some form of initiative and now Kg7 would be too passive (i presume)} 18. exf5 Nxf5 {well i play probably to much "automatically" i newer had an idea of placing queen on g5 and take that pawn with gxf5.. now when i thick about it.. Q on g5 (or h4 for that mater), N on d4 ("semi - dominating" on white queen), if f2 pawn moves (or disappears) some discover tactic possible. f pawn ready to march on a king side backed up by a rook..  a crap :)  why did i take the pawn with night..} 19. b4 {um.. i presumed 19. Bxf5 Rxf5... wasn't expecting b4 now..} Kg7 {i already got question about this move.. it was my "original plan", what? well it's not like i am a grand master of chess lol Why you smile :) so, what would you play instead? Nd4? Bd4? axb4? Qg5?  (lol all are better than my move)} 20. Re1 {U! now i am happy i didn't trade bishop} axb4 {that question from before.. which move to make (Nd4? Bd4? axb4? Qg5) probably other moves are better but i decided to exchange pawns now, play Bd4 (maybe force a exchange of rooks on a-file or gain control on a-file), than if i move K from f-file i have a nice play on f2... feels like i am doing good} 21. axb4 Bd4 22. Rxa8 Qxa8 {ok, forced exchange .. now i had time to wait for the white move i thought what he will do next..} 23. Ne4 {obvious.. } d5 {i relay had time to think what to do on move 23. but now i ask my self why not Qa3? 23.	Ne4	Qa3 24.	Bxf5	Rxf5 25.	Nxd6	Bxf2+ 26.	Kh1	Bxe1 27.	Nxf5+	gxf5 28.	Qxe1	(and it is bad game for black) Well i was to much focused with the idea to take the f pawn with the Bishop that i couldn't see a simple Rook can take and i gain a move because the black king has to move ..  Also why is d5 bad?} 24. Bxf5 {well at least now i have an option to take the knight with a pawn also i believe this was the move that turned for the win (whites move not black) if he played Nc5 (look at e6) he would regain initiative (in my humble opinion) and this is why 23. ... d5 was bad} dxe4 25. Bxe4 {and finally i can take Bxf2+} Bxf2+ 26. Kh1 Bxe1 27. Qxe1 Qa3 {it looks like i finally decided to move a queen :) well the rest of the game isn't that much interesting (or complicated) black ahead in material and decides to trade down as much possible to have on the end rook vs bishop and win} 28. h3 Qb2 29. Qg3 Rf6 {my brain is usual "off" in this material advantage.. like what about:  29. ... Rf1+ 30. Ke2 g5 ... } 30. Bf3 {chance to trade off} Qb1+ 31. Kh2 Qxd3 32. Qxe5 Qxc4 33. Qe7+ Qf7 {probably Rf7 would be better but i hoped to trade queens } 34. Qd8 {of course.. } Qe6 35. Bg4 {and finally a forced trade of queens and white soon resigned..} Qd6+ 36. Qxd6 Rxd6 37. Bf3 b6 38. Kg3 Kf6 39. Kf4 c5 {This was my 1th annotation so if you liked/hated it please leave a comment or send me a msg. thx}
