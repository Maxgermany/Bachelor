[White "rookie879 "]
[Black "Nathan Coll (1300)"]
[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence, Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 {Surprise surprise! This is the first time I have opened with e4 in a tournament for years! However, I knew my opponent would play 1...e5 and I felt comfortable with the openings that arise from that} e5 {As expected.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez. I was tempted to play 3. Bc4 here but I did not want the possibility of my opponent playing the Two Knights Defense with 3... Nf6 so I decided to play the "Spanish Torture", an opening I have played from the Black side many times.} d6 {Generally considered a weaker response to Black's 3rd move. While solid, it blocks in Black's DSB and gives White an immediate space advantage} 4. d4 {White gleefully takes control of the center. He will hope to use his center control and space advantage in the middlegame} exd4 5. Nxd4 Bd7 {Protecting and Breaking the pin on the Knight on c6} 6. O-O {My coach told me after the game that castling Queenside is more common in this variation but I still feel comfortable on the Kingside. } Nxd4 {Black takes the knight occupying the center and exposes an attack on the Bishop on b5} 7. Bxd7+ {Necessary} Qxd7 8. Qxd4 {This Queen becomes a very powerful piece. Normally it is not best to bring your queen out so early but in this case, Black can not easily disturb her from her menacing spot in the center.} b6 {At this point, I knew Black would castle Queenside. My mindset switched to thinking how I can open up lines to his king using by center control and better development} 9. Nc3 O-O-O {As expected} 10. a4 {! Simple but strong. Black must react to White's threat of 11.a5, breaking down Black's wall} a5 {Weakens the light squares even further but Black doesn't have any other better alternative} 11. Nd5 {White brings his knight to this central outpost and will be ready to push b4} Nf6 {Challenging this strong knight} 12. c4 {?! Better to stick to the original plan of 12. b4! where Black's castle will be opened up} Nxd5 {?! This justifies White's previous move! It is best not to exchange just yet} 13. cxd5 {Now White has an open c-file that his rooks can attack on. White seems to have a good edge here} c5 {? Blunders the exchange. It is best not to move pawns out in front of your castled king because there will be many threats that can be created by the newly formed open lines.} 14. dxc6 e.p. {White gladly exchages this central pawn for an open c-file} Qxc6 {It is best for Black to play something like 14...Qa7 and use the pawn as shelter. 15. Be3 Kc7 where Black's position is bad but he is still only a pawn down. This move loses the exchange to...} 15. Bg5 {! White now not only theatens the rook on d8 but he also threatens to pin the queen with 16. Rac1. Black cannot pary both threats} Qb7 16. Rac1+ {An intermezzo that gets the rook onto the open file with tempo} Kd7 17. Bxd8 Kxd8 18. Rfd1 {White's pieces are all centralized and bearing down on the king while Black's rook and bishop are still on its originial squares!  18. e5 d5 19. Rfd1 was also good} f6 {Black thinks he has stopped e5...} 19. e5 {But white just pushes it anyway!} fxe5 20. Qxe5 {At this point, I began to look for the kill. My tactical instict told me that there was a nice way to capitalize on this position.} h5 {20...Qd7 was best to protect the threat but 21. Qg5+ still looks very good for White} 21. Rxd6+ {! A nice little exercise that nets White a greater material advantage. Notice how all open central files are actively used by the White pieces} Bxd6 22. Qxd6+ Qd7 {After 22...Ke8 I worked out 23. Re1+ (23. Rc7 also forces mate) Kf7 24. Qe6+ Kf8 25. Qe8#} 23. Qb8+ {Black now loses the rook in the corner} Ke7 24. Qxh8 Qd2 {White has nothing to fear} 25. Qxg7+ Kd6 26. Qc3 {Black's final threat is parried and White's material advantage brings home the win.} Qg5 27. Rd1+ Ke6 28. Qe3+ {White forces the Queen trade and the rest is pretty simple} Qxe3 29. fxe3 Ke5 30. Kf2 Kf5 31. Rd6 Kg4 32. Rd5 {Cuts off the King into a mating net} Kh4 33. Kf3 b5 34. g3+ Kh3 35. Rxh5# {A nice start to the championship! This win helped me calm my nerves a little and helped me mentally lock into the tournament}
