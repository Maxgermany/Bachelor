[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 {In this game, White challenged black (me) to a vigorous game of Chess. Unfortunately, it resulted in the systematic destruction of White's power.  Instead of crushing my opponent, I just picked White off before looking for opportunities to get a checkmate, while avoiding checkmate myself.  She had me at the ropes several times, but I managed to checkmate White in 26 moves.   White opens with King Pawn opening (e4).} e5 {Black responds in kind. ...e5. } 2. h3 Nf6 {(?) Here White has moved to h3, which is a preventive move on White's part.  In my experience with playing this player, she moves her a and h pawns in order to prevent the bishops from pinning her knights.  I respond as Black by deploying my gN to f6.} 3. Nc3 Nc6 {White could set up for the Lolli Attack if she set up correctly.  White could have moved KN to Nf3 at the beginning and gotten aggressive.  Here, a 3 knight defense manfests itself.  } 4. Bc4 Bc5 5. Qf3 {White deploys her Queen at this point. } Nd4 {Black promptly takes an outpost supported by e5, in order to challenge the Queen.  My target as Black was the undefended c2 pawn.  ...Nc2, Kd1, Nxa1. I had no interest in the Queen at that time, even though she would have been a tasty target if White moved Kd1. } 6. Qd1 {White's queen retreats to d1, losing tempo, but a sensible defense at that. } O-O {Here, Black castled to make sure his King was safe. } 7. Nge2 b6 8. O-O {White Castles at this move.  Notice how White is challenging my Knight.  I ignored that challenge since my Knight is on a superb outpost.  My opponent's queen is trapped by her own pieces after losing tempo. } Bb7 9. Kh1 {(?!)} Nxe4 {Nxe4 because of the poor defense of e4's pawn. I am now challenging the knight on c3. } 10. d3 Qh4 11. Ng3 {White should have taken Black's knight on e4 at this point.  White should have been on a great outpost. } Rad8 12. Re1 Nxf2+ {Black moves in to go Check to the King.  The queen is lost. } 13. Kh2 {White's King moves to h2.} Nxd1 {Black gobbles up White's Queen. } 14. Rxd1 {White's Rook finally eats Black's Knight. } Rfe8 {Black takes control of the e file. } 15. Nge4 d5 {After White moves his Knight to c4, Black presses his pawn to d5 in order to take the center and to threaten White's Bishop on c4. } 16. Bb3 {White retreats her bishop. } dxe4 {Black gobbles up White's Knight. } 17. Be3 {(?) White moves to pin the Knight on c4, which Black has in reserve for the perfect moment.  Black's knight is supported by his pawn Outpost at e5 and his Bishop at c5. } Nxb3 {and I take the Bishop on b3 in response.} 18. axb3 {White takes the Knight on b3. } a5 {To prevent a possible move, Black advanced his a pawn to a5. } 19. Nb5 {White's Knight takes advantage of the hole at b5. } Bxe3 20. Nxc7 {(!) Ouch!} Re7 21. Nb5 exd3 {Black's pawn at e4 captures White's pawn at d3 in order to claim the d file. } 22. Nd6 Rxd6 {Black's rook eats White's knight at d6 after the Knight was moved to challenge Black's bishop on b7.  Which turned out to be a mistake. } 23. c4 Qg5 {Here Black moved to declare Checkmate in 1 move, which is true.  But White countered with . . .} 24. g3 {(!)} Red7 25. b4 Bf4 {Black moved his Bishop to f4 in order to challenge White's pawn on g3. } 26. c5 Qxg3# {Final move.  All of White's pieces were taken and White cornered her own King. }
