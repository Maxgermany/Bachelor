[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian Defense. The only - real - option for black to gain winning chances. This opening is for experts only, on both sides... White, as well as black, could win this...} 2. f4 {The Grand Prix Attack, cooked up by the likes of Petrosjan and Tal, in blitz games. The idea is quick development, via confusing the real issues: Magic... Black is already faced with 2. ... Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4.  White uses this to fight Alekhine...  The logical approach 2. ... d5, will be met by 3. e5 Nc6 4. Nf3 Bg4 5. g3 Qb6 6. Bg2 and castling options. We steal this from King's Indian... One of Fischer's favourite approaches...  } d6 {The standard follow-up in most variations in the Sicilian. Right now, d5 was still better... Pawn c5 needs not to be covered right now... If any covering at al... Playing black, I would prefer 2. ... g6 here, persuing Dragon variations, or Kings Indian tendencies, with Bg7/Nf6... } 3. Nf3 {What white wants... After Bg4, the plan might still be g3, ..., Bg2, ..., 0-0} Nc6 {This calls for different measures... Options are 4. c3 d5 (of course) 5. e5 Bf5!, with a possible bind on c2 via Nb4... The basic plan of Alekhine Defense... } 4. Bb5 {We switch plans, and discard the 4. g3, 5. Bg2, 6. 0-0, variation... White steals this from Ruy Lopez, to bind Nc6 just for now... The Fischer-move Bf1-c4-b3 is too early... After 4. Bc4, e6/Nf6 clears all threats... } Bd7 {Now, after 4. ... Nf6 5. d3 a6 6. Bxc6+ bxc6 7. e5!, preventing g6, and Bg7...} 5. O-O {Castle never too early, but never too late... } e6 {After 5. ... Nf6 6. d3 a6 7. Bxc6 Bxc6 8. e5, nothing gets really solved for black... Too early for d5...} 6. Nc3 {6. Nc3! stems from the Vienna variations, in Queens Gambit with d4... White is gaining strong control over d5 now... The pinnacle of the Sicilian Defense: if black can play d5, and c4, it is over for white... White is soon threatening d2-d3-d4-d5... Thanks to 2. f4, Ne5/Nd4 has no meaning left...  } Nf6 7. d3 {The strongest continuation for both sides... After 6. ... Be7, also d3... For white, it is too early for 7. d4... We have to give Nc6 no slack... Not good is 7. e5? dxe5 8. fxe5 (Nxe5, Nd4!) Ng4! No good for black is 7. ... d5 8. Ne5 dxe4 (on d4, also Bxc6) 9. Bxc6 Bxc6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. dxe4...} Be7 8. e5 {For black, there is more sense in 7. ... a6, persuing Najdorf tendencies... 8. Bc4 b5 9. Bb3 (the Fischer approach, still controlling d5, and even f7, after f4-f5) Qb6 10. Kh1... White follows the natural lead, it all evolves round e5... } dxe5 9. fxe5 {This rules out d5 - for black - and we leave the Sicilian Defense strategy... A lot more problems for white, poses 8. ... Ng4, attacking e5... 9. Ng5 Nh6 10. Qh5 0-0 11. exd6 Bxd6 grinds to a halt soon for white, so does 10. exd6 Bxd6... After 9. h3, Nh6 10. exd6 Bxd6 11. Ne4 Be7...  Now, after 9. ... Ng4, 10. Qe2, keeping an eye on Ng4...  } Nd5 10. Ne4 {There is no glory in 10. Nxd5 exd5 (and we're back at the Sicilian) 11. Bxc6 Bxc6 12. Qe1... After 12. ... d4 13. Qg3 Bf8 14. Ng5 Bd5, or 13. ... Qd7 14. Qxg7 0-0-0 black closes his ranks... } Qc7 {Inaccurate attempt, to an early 0-0-0. This robs black of Nc7, after c4. This gives white an extra tempo to complete his plan. After 10. ... 0-0, white has more problems. Directly 11. a4 Qc7 12. Qe1 Nd4 13. Nxd4 cxd4 14. Bxd7 Qxd7 15. c4 dxc3 16. bxc3 f5! 17. exf6 Bxf6 18. Nxf6+ Nxf6, snuffs out whites attack. After 11. c4 Nb6 12. Bf4 a6 13. Bxc6 Bxc6 14. Qe2 Qc7...} 11. c4 Nb6 12. a4 {Fighting Alekhine springs to mind... Also 12. Bg5 0-0 13. Qd2 h6, or 13. Qe1 a6 stops white dead in his tracks... Now, after 12. ... 0-0 13. a5 Nc8 14. Qe1 a6 15. Bxc6 Bxc6 16. Qg3! Bxe4 17. dxe4 Kh8 18. Bg5!, black is in trouble...} a6 13. a5 {12. ... a6!, is sharpest for black now, after missing out on move 7... Now, there is no turning back for white... } Nc8 {Remember, this knight came from g8, on move 6, fourth move now... 13. ... axb5 14. axb6 Qc8 15. Rxa8 Qxa8 16. cxb5, or 13. ... Nxa5 14. Nd6+ Bxd6 15. exd6 Qxd6 16. Bxd7+ Nxd7 17. Rxa5 b6 18. Ra3 e5 19. Be3... Longside castling is prevented, for a couple of moves...} 14. Bxc6 {Of course, we take the horse, pinned at move 4; thus, defending a5/e5 against Qc7... This is all part of whites plan, black has much room for error now... Nc8 is a burdon, and Bc6 has to be taken... But how?} Bxc6 15. Qe1 {After 14. ... Qxc6 15. Nfg5! Bxg5 (0-0?, Qh5, h6, Rf6; f6, exf6; Rf8, Nxh7, Rh8, Qh5, threatening Nf6+) 16. Bxg5, Rf8 (Qc7?, Rxf7!!, Qxe5 (Kxf7??, Qh5+), Rf2) 17. Qh5, Qc7 18. Qxh7 Qxe5 19. Rae1 black is overpowered...  After 14. ... bxc6 15. Be3!, threatening capture of c5, followed by b4, and d4 soon... Black is completely tied up...   White is preparing Qg3, to start an attack against blacks kingside, now; still on schedule...} Bxe4 16. Qxe4 {After 15... O-O 16. Qg3 Bxe4 17. dxe4 Kh8 18. Ra3... Now, 16. ... 0-0 17. Qg4 leads to similar variations... 16. ... Na7 (preparing 0-0-0, obvious enough) 17. Qg4 Rg8 (g6, Bg5; 0-0??, Bh6, all else fails for black), spoiling 0-0, 18. Bd2, preparing attack against the queenside, via c5... For now, white controls most dark squares, and has to keep making it black castling, and untangling his position, as hard as it takes...} O-O 17. Qg4 {Practically forced. White has to spend this extra tempo, and threaten Bh6. We need a means to develop Bc1 with a threat, and gain that extra tempo. 17. Bd2 Na7 18. Bc3 Nc6, leads to nothing, 17. Be3 Na7 18. d4 cxd4 19. Nxd4 Nc6 releases all tensions, 17. Bg5 Na7, goes the same way...} Re8 {There is a big difference, now that whites Queen is at g4, in stead of g3, in a previous meant variation. Threats against black kingside involve keeping e5 covered, and lest we forget poor uncovered d3? After Nc8-a7-c6, d4 is never going to happen... Blacks best defense - therefore - lies in forcing b4/d4... 17. ... Kh8 18. Bg5 h6 (or Na7, d4) 19. Be3 Na7, or 17. ... Rd8 18. Bh6 (Ra3, Na7) Bf8 (that was blacks point) 19. Be3... Sadly, 17. ... Rd8, is met with 18. Bg5! Blacks last move is loss of tempo, covering Be7 is futile... } 18. Rf2 {This gives white an extra tempo to compose a web of new threats. Now, after playing Bg5, we also cover b2, and threaten Raf1... Be7 - just like Nc8 - becomes a liability... After 18. Bh6? Bf8 19. Bd2 Ne7! That is the whole of blacks point... After 19. Ng5 Qxe5 20. Nxf7 Qd4+ forces swapping Queens... 18. Rf2 prevents this also... Ergo: Bh6 is still a threat...} Bf8 {Black tries to squirm out, but this is not the way. Black is hoping for Nc8-e7-g6, but he won't get on time. Correct - so to speak -  was 18. ... Na7 19. Bh6 (white has to sit this one out, or else Nc6) Bf8 20. Ng5 (same) Qxe5 21. Nxf7 Qd4 (no check, thanks to Rf2) 22. Qg3! (otherwise we had to swap Queens) Nc6 23. Bg5 e5... After Re1, threatening Re4, we have at least e4...} 19. Ng5 {After 19. Bh6? Ne7, 20. Bd2 Ng6, or better Rad8!, whites attack is snuffed out... With Be7 out of the picture, 19. Ng5 gains extra strength. After 19. ... Qxe5?? 20. Qh5 it's game over... All of blacks weaknesses are revealed now... Nxf7, or Qh5 is the least of blacks worries... So 19. ... g6/Re7 (Na7, Bd2, ..., Raf1) is forced...} Re7 {This rules out variations involving Ne7 for a little while; white must use this immediately. After 19. ... g6 20. Qh3/Qh4 h5 21. Nxf7 Re7/Bg7 22. Bh6/Ng5! white wins... After 19. ... Qxe5?? 20. Qh5 - threatening deadly Qxf7+ - black loses the Queen, or mate...} 20. Qh5 {This is clear enough. Only 20. ... h6 is left... After that, 21. Ne4, also covering e5, completely locking up blacks position. After that, we need some plan, to defend d3 long enough to be able to develop Bc1...} h6 21. Ne4 {Bxh6 is a minor threath, now... Probably just strong enough to withstand Rd7, Rf3, Ne7... Given the right moment, white has Nf6+, or even Rf6... For instance 21. ... g6 22. Nf6+ Kh8 (Kg7, Qxh6 mate) 23. Qh4! (threatens Bxh6) h5 24. g4... After 21. ... Kh8 22. Bxh6 gxh6 23. Rf6, without further adue... With Bc1 out of the way, Raf1 is a matter of time... After 21. ... Qd8 (Rd7, Rf3), the astounding 22. Bg5 Qxd3 (hxg5?, Nxg5) 23. Nxc5 g6 24. Qg4 Qd8 25. Rxf7...} Rd7 22. Rf3 Ne7 23. Bxh6 {Black resigned, under the pressure, after 21. Ne4... Here is, what might have followed... After 23. ... gxh6, Rf6... }
