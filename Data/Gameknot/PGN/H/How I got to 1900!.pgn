1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I reached the important milestone of Near-Expertdom with this game - just 97 points south of it!  I did get a bit of a leg up from timeouts/early resignations from Masters Freddy and Chrisobee but, after being anchored in the high 1700s for months on end I decided to enter into Concordborn's MT to try and pick up rating points against 1500-1700 players.  Thankfully I managed to get the wins which boosted me up to where I am now - 1903.  This is the game which finally got me to those dizzy heights.  Here is the analysis.  I will start with move 7 as the first 6 moves are set moves from the MT.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Be2 {7. Be2 - white clears the way for castling.} a6 8. Na3 b5 {8. ...... b5 - pawn push.} 9. Nd5 Nxe4 10. c4 b4 11. Nc2 {11. Nc2 - after white attempted to entrench a knight on d5 I won a pawn with Nxe4.  After pushing my b pawn I drove back white's other knight.  Can I remain a pawn up?  We shall see.} a5 12. O-O Bb7 13. Be3 {13. Be3 - oh-oh, white is threatening either Bb6 or Nb6.  I tried to prevent this intrusion with Nc5.  Will this hold?  Again, only time will tell.} Nc5 14. f4 Be7 15. f5 Bf6 16. g4 {16. g4 - pawn roll.} O-O 17. g5 Bxg5 18. Bxc5 dxc5 19. Bf3 {19. Bf3 - after this little stouche I am now two pawns up.  White still has a knight on d5 but will this be adequate compo.  Again, only time will tell.} Ne7 20. f6 Nxd5 21. fxg7 Kxg7 22. cxd5 {22. cxd5 - after this stouche I remain two pawns ahead but my kingside pawn structure is busted and Henry is putting in an order for a pair of medieval stockings - 100 denier medium sized Glenda dear!} Rg8 23. Be4 h6 24. Qf3 {24. Qf3 - now comes the Wicked Witch of the West and she has her beady eye on my pawn on f7.  Fou Lenoir now blocks this file by moving to f4.} Bf4 25. Rf2 Kh8+ {25. .... Kh8+ - discovered check.} 26. Kf1 Ba6+ 27. Bd3 Bxd3+ 28. Qxd3 {28. Qxd3 - bishop trade.  At least a possible discovery on my rook on a8 from white's lsb has been addressed.} Qd6 {28. ...... Qd6 - a new defensive role for Glenda - blockade.} 29. Rd1 Rg6 {29. ...... Rg6 - with a possible plan of doubling up on the g file and attacking the WK.} 30. Ne1 Rf6 31. Nf3 Qa6 32. Qxa6 Raxa6 {32. ...... Rxa6 - queen trade.  I wanted to avoid the march of the d5 pawn so both rooks double up on my third rank instead.} 33. Ke2 c4 {33. ..... c4 - this pawn is very vulnerable at the moment.  It seems unthinkable that this pawn will spell checkmate for my opponent many moves down the line doesn't it?  This pawn move prevents Kd3 and keeps the WK anchored to its third rank - at least for the time being.} 34. Ne1 Kg7 35. Nc2 Kf8 {35. ...... Kf8 - Henry is worried about the d pawn advancing and wishes to free his men to do other work than simply blockade it.  Dare I assume "Advantage Black" here?} 36. Rdf1 Ke7 37. h3 Bg5 38. Ne3 Rxf2+ 39. Rxf2 Bxe3 40. Kxe3 {40. Kxe3 - the WK moves to the third rank at last, but not before a lot of wood has disappeared from the board.  With the remaining rooks off the board I think it is game set and match to jstevens1 - but the rooks are on the board and there is still work for me to do to bring about a victory here.} Rg6 41. h4 Rg4 42. h5 Rg5 43. Ke4 Rxh5 {43. ..... Rxh5 - might as well.} 44. d6+ Kxd6 {44. ..... Kxd6 - again - might as well, even though I know that the f7 pawn is finally gonna drop.} 45. Rxf7 Rh4+ {45. ..... Rh4+ - I wanna get my rook to h2 to get among white's remaining pawns, but first I want to drive back the WK.  If the WK moves to f5, however, I can always force a K & P ending with Rf4+.} 46. Ke3 Rh2 {46. ..... Rh2 - white can always avoid dropping a further pawn by playing Rf2 but it gives me the desired K & P ending.  White does not want this.} 47. Ra7 Rxb2 48. Rxa5 c3 {48. ..... c3 - suddenly, in the space of one move, that weakie on c4 has become a formidable unit on c3 - just two squares from Glendadom.} 49. Rb5 h5 {49. .... h5 - here I decided to push my h pawn in order to distract the WK and WR away from my queenside pawns.} 50. Rb6+ Kc5 51. Rh6 Rxa2 {51. ..... Rxa2 - white's final pawn drops.  I now think that the WR and WK have far too much to do.} 52. Rxh5 c2 {52. ..... c2 - one square, just one square .....} 53. Kd2 b3 {53. ..... b3 - my b pawn supports my c pawn.  My e pawn is gonna drop but Henry has a plan to take refuge on b2 and I also plan to plonk my rook on a1.  When that happens, white cannot stop my pawn from reaching c1 and inflicting eventual Glendadoom on his king.} 54. Rxe5+ Kb4 55. Re8 Ra1 {55. ..... Ra1 - I now set up conditional moves to get Henry to b2.  We play out the first of them and then white gives up the ghost and hands me that 1900 rating.  Well, I still feel a little out of my depth against players in the 1900 - 2100 bracket even with this new rating.  At least if I play to the top of my game I can expect to hold my own against these players.  But consistency will be the key. At least I can never go below 1700 whatever happens.  So, I will bask in this new found glory and then concentrate on my other games.  I hope you have a good read - bye for now - Joanne} 56. Rb8+ Ka3 {}
