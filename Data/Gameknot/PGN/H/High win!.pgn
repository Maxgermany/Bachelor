1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nd2 b6 4. e4 {...accepting the challenge for the e4 square.} d6 5. Ngf3 Bb7 6. Bd3 h6 7. c3 {I can allow g5 by black.} Be7 8. h4 {...but not any more. I accept Ng4 at some point. } Nbd7 9. Qc2 {...putting an eye on g6.} c5 {Now I thought about e5, with pressure on exd6, but it was either too complicated, and with unsure results after Nh5 (exd6, NxB, exB, Qxd7, and I have to defend my g2 pawn, which is not very pleasant. I tried another way.} 10. Bb5 a6 11. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {Now there is no Nh5 anymore...} 12. e5 {After the exchanges his lsb can take on g2, but after Rg1, I think I have compensation for the pawn.} d5 {...king of a strategic victory? Now black threats c4 and a queenside pawnstorm. } 13. Rc1 {Probably a weak move. He'd like to take on d4 and make me retae with the N. This N will be "pinned" because if it moves, he'll play d4, opening the diag for his B. I planned to take with the pawn, and after Rf8, Qd1 and the forces on the c column are balanced. } Rc8 14. Qd3 {...kind of provoking him, so being uncoherent with my previous plan. Rc1 is undefended. Still, Nxd4 is not completely bad. } cxd4 15. Nxd4 Nc5 16. Qg3 {This was the counter-idea: now I'm pressing his castling side. } g6 {Now he can threat to infiltrate with his Q (aftr Qd7-Qa4). I want to get rid of his N on c5...} 17. Nd2b3 {If NxN, axN, Bc5 and I'll have time to either o-o or Kd2. Even Be3. } Ne4 {Here, I spent some time on Nxe6. If NxQ, NxQ, and if NxR, NxB, then I'll take back his N whil I can shield mine on d6. If Nxe6, fxN, Qxg6+, Kd7, Qg7 (pinning the B!). But to sac a piece against such a player should have been not serious, without proper time to calculate. } 18. Qg4 h5 {A pawn advance is a weakness...} 19. Qh3 {Keeping an eye on e6. } Qd7 {...which he met, willingly or not. Now he threats Qa4, with annoying attack on my a pawn. Not sure about that, anyway, b4 is not so simple an attack... or maybe I should have gone for this one.} 20. Qd3 {I can leave h4 with the R only as a defence. Maybe Qe3 was better, with a "discovered" attack in b6 threatened after Nd4 moves, but I didn't have the intention to allow him to play d4 and free his powerful lsb.} Nc5 21. Qe2 {Now I am seriously thinking in g4 at some point. } Ne4 22. f3 {Well, what else?} Nc5 23. g4 {If hxg4, h5. His Kingside is "naked", while my pieces can easily reach it. } Nxb3 24. axb3 {My N still blocking the d pawn. } b5 {I see. If b4, a5. My Q side wont'hold forever, so I have to attack. } 25. Bg5 b4 26. f4 {Both attacks are going on.} bxc3 27. bxc3 {Calmly. He'll have to spend more moves to break in, while his Q can't infiltrate. } Ba3 28. Rc2 {This is a good move for my anyway.} Bc5 {He threats to exchange my N for his B, then the rooks? It's fine to me. } 29. Bf6 Rh7 30. gxh5 Rxh5 31. f5 {! I think this is a good move. He can't use his g pawn to take it, and if exf5, I can use my h R to create pressure on the e column. } Bxd4 32. fxg6 {! The R is threatned, and gxf7+ too. } fxg6 33. cxd4 {Qd3 was probably better, but the result is the same. } Rxc2 34. Qxc2 {...g6 is threatened, the d pawn is still blocked...} Qb5 35. Qxg6+ {...and game over! } Kd7 36. Qf7+ Kc8 {}
