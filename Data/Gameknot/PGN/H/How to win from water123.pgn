1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 e6 4. O-O Nf6 5. Re1 Be7 6. c3 {Not best... 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nc6 was to be preferred... >>> Note to tiger_lilov: I do not use computers in my evaluations... I play as a human... But thanks for the enlightenment<<<} O-O 7. d4 {A little late, now... Considering the threat d5, better 7. Bb3 Nc6...} a6 {Very deep... What is wrong with 7. ... Nxe4 8. Rxe4 d5 9. Bxd5 Qxd5 10. Re5 Qd7?} 8. e5 {No second chance, but better first 8. dcx5 dxc5 9. e5...} dxe5 9. Nxe5 {No offense, but I think white had better played 9. dxe5 Qxd1 10. Rxd1 Nd5 11. Bxd5 exd5 12. Rxd5...} cxd4 10. cxd4 b5 11. Bb3 {Not good, either... 11. Be2 Bb7 12. Nc3, holds better...} Bb7 12. Nc3 Nbd7 {Of course, 12. ... Nc6 works better for black...} 13. Nxf7 {Very sharp play, by white... And precisely at the right moment... After 13. Qe2 Nb6, the edge is gone...} Rxf7 14. Bxe6 Nf8 {Who cares, what I think? But I would have preferred 14. ... Bd6} 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Qb3+ {Not good... After 16. Bg5, white holds an equal position...} Nd5 {So this is how you win from a weaker player... Very instructive... After 16. ... Bd5 17. Qd1 Ne6/Ng6, white can start all over again, in a slightly worse position... This - however -  loses immediately...} 17. Re5 {Without further adue...} Ng6 {Making it worse, probably out of frustration... After 17. ... Ne6 18. Nxd5 Nxd4 19. Qd1 Bd6 20. Bg5, matters could be contained...} 18. Rxd5 {Sharp as a doornail...} Bxd5 19. Qxd5+ {Black gets very lucky... White is squandering his advantage once more... After 19. Nxd5, black can happily resign...} Qxd5 20. Nxd5 Rd8 21. Nxe7 {All forced, for white...} Rxd4 {And justice, for all... After 21. ... Nxe7 22. Be3 Rc8, white is still somewhat better, but has a very long way to go... Luckily, this is not blitz... White's next move ends all...} 22. Be3 {Black resigns... Probably out of resentment, of his own play... According to water123, the annotation is poor; as usually... He is a sore loser, so he can never be a winner...}
