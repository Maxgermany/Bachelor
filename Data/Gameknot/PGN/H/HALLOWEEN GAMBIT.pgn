1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nxe5 {Four knights (C46), Schultze-Mueller gambit a.k.a. Halloween gambit} Nxe4 {Declined!} 5. Qh5 {Interesting move forcing black to defend. Black should not play Nxe5 or else: 6. Qxe5+ Qe7 7. Qxe4 Qxe4 8. Nxe4 and white has a decisive advantage} Qf6 6. Qxf7+ Qxf7 7. Nxf7 {This move gives white a pawn advantage if black plays Kxf7} Kxf7 {Better was Nxf2! which leads to a very unusual game: 7 ...Nxf2! 8. Nxh8 Nxh1 9. Nb5 Nb4 10. Nxc7+ Kd8 11. Nxa8 Nxc2+ 12. Kd1 Nxa1 13. Nf7+ Ke7 14. Ng5 Nf2+ 15. Ke1 Ng4 16. Bd3 etc} 8. Bc4+ {It makes sense to develop the bishop first before capturing the knight otherwise black may play d5.} Ke8 9. Nxe4 Nd4 {Threatens a rook fork.} 10. Bd3 {Prevents the fork} d5 {Black tries to gain space and allows his light bishop to move.} 11. Ng3 Bd6 12. c3 {Attacking black's knight. An alternative prospect is b3 to fianchetto the dark bishop, attacking the knight and g7 pawn.} Bxg3 {An unfavorable trade by black.} 13. hxg3 Bf5 14. Bxf5 Nxf5 15. d4 {White is ready to develop his bishop and two rooks. Perhaps g4 would have been better though.} Kd7 {Mobilizing the rook pair} 16. Bf4 Rae8+ 17. Kd2 Nd6 {White chooses to simplify, exchanging his bishop and rook.} 18. Bxd6 Kxd6 19. Rae1 Rxe1 20. Rxe1 Rf8 21. f4 c6 {Black could do with gaining queenside space (b5), but he plays it safe instead.} 22. Rh1 h6 23. Rh5 a5 24. Ke3 a4 {storm pawn :P} 25. g4 {white focuses on the kingside.} Re8+ 26. Re5 Ra8 {Not the most productive move.} 27. g5 a3 28. b3 {Simple choice. b4 would be better.} hxg5 29. Rxg5 {White's initiative seems stronger after this pawn exchange.} Re8+ 30. Re5 {Better is Kd2: white can safely defend his kingside pawns while his King wins an extra pawn after b4.} Rf8 31. f5 Rf6 {This prevents further a check and further advance.} 32. g4 {Of course white can overpower this rook easily.} Rh6 {Black has the idea or taking the a2 pawn, which white can't defend.} 33. g5 {Black resigned without decisively losing. With accurate play white would win anyhow, but play might have continued as such:} Rh3+ 34. Kf4 Rh2 35. Re6+ {Kd7 gives black a battle in which he can last at least for 37 more moves. Kc7 is slightly more hopeful in that white's task is more difficult and fatal mistakes can be made.} Kc7 36. Re7+ Kb6 37. Rxg7 Rxa2 {Now it is a race to promotion for both sides.} 38. Rh7 {White preparing the rook to attack black's a3 pawn.} Rg2 {Allowing the pawn space while putting pressure on white's pieces} 39. Rh8 {Ideally getting the rook on the a-file} Ka7 {Black stops this plan} 40. Rh1 {White finds a better way to stop the pawn} a2 41. g6 b5 {Black has nothing better to do.} 42. Ra1 Kb6 43. Ke5 b4 {Black clears up space so he can get to white's rook} 44. cxb4 Kb5 45. Kf6 Kxb4 46. g7 Kxb3 47. Kf7 Kb2 {Forced move.} 48. Rxa2+ Kxa2 49. g8=Q Rxg8 {Forced.} 50. Kxg8 c5 {White has won, but this is black's best move, with a possibility of white blundering.} 51. dxc5 {White's f6 would be a relatively easy win (mate in 21) after eventual simplification to a King/pawn vs King situation. Shown here is dxc5 for speculation, which although is still a mate in 37 is much trickier to play.} d4 52. c6 {f6 takes longer to win.} d3 53. c7 d2 54. c8=Q d1=Q 55. Qc4+ Ka1 56. Qc3+ Kb1 57. f6 Qg1+ 58. Kf8 {If the king moves into the h column, a win will take much longer.} Qg5 59. f7 Qd8+ {Black can only try to disrupt the situation.} 60. Kg7 Qg5+ 61. Kh7 Qf5+ {Be aware that I have included the variation of black's play that keeps the game alive for the longest, but also that white may make a mistake and turn the win into a draw. For amateurs, certain parts of this exercise as white are possible and easy to play less than perfectly. Even if black does not get perpetual check, white can have trouble forcing a win if he is inexperienced.} 62. Kg8 Qd5 63. Qg3 Kc1 64. Qg4 Kb2 65. Kg7 Qb7 66. Qg5 Ka2 67. Qg6 Ka3 68. Qc2 Qe7 {A simple less-than-objective move here such as: Qf2, Qh2, Qc4, Qc8, Qb1, Qd1, Kg6, Kg8 will result in a draw due to perpetual check. It is in conditions such as these that Black has small hopes.} 69. Qc3+ Ka2 70. Qc4+ Kb2 71. Qc6 Kb3 72. Qd5+ Ka4 73. Qf5 Qc7 74. Qg4+ Ka5 75. Kg8 Qb7 76. f8=Q Qb3+ 77. Kg7 Qc3+ 78. Kf7 Qb3+ 79. Kg6 Qd3+ 80. Qff5+ Qb5 81. Qd4 Qxf5+ 82. Kxf5 {Mate in 5.}
