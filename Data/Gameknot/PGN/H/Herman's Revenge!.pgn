1. e4 {http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15130039&rnd=0.9506428851640706 <-- GK analysis on this game } d6 {The Pirc Defence [thanks to nosferatu for the correction]} 2. d4 Nf6 {I was expecting Black to play e5, but this is perfectly playable as well! } 3. Nc3 Bg4 {A follow-up to the knight move - it attacks the queen - but this threat is easily countered! } 4. Nf3 {4.f3 would have driven back the bishop, but I wanted that square for the knight... in hindsight though, f3 would have probably been better as it supports the centre and the knight can reach e2 [after the bishop moves] } Nbd7 {Black may have been worried about d5 after Nc6... well, I would be but whether it would be the best move, I don't know. At any rate, according to GK analysis White has come out of the opening with the advantage. [of less than a pawn, but an advantage all the same!] } 5. Be2 {this and Bc4 are both playable - White decides to break the pin on the knight. } e5 {5...e5 comes now, and White has the option of locking up the centre with 6.d5. Black's reply... } 6. O-O {...would have probably been the same as his reply to White's castling. } c6 {Perhaps the intention of 4...Nbd7; this will challenge White's d5 should he decided to play it. } 7. Bg5 {White doesn't play it yet and continues development } Be7 8. Qd2 b5 {As the development of White comes to an end [Black has yet to castle and connect rooks, but his position seems solid enough at this point], Black has ambitions of queenside pawn expansion... } 9. d5 {? which could have been put to good use with this mistake! If Black plays 9...b4! here then he'll have the opportunity to win a pawn next move with Nxd5; 9...d5 10.Nd1 Nxd5 11.exd5 Bxf3 12.Bxf3 Bxg5. Fortunately for me, Black misses this too and exchanges pawns } cxd5 10. exd5 b4 {Pushing back my knight... } 11. Nd1 {And now the small advantage I had achieved in the opening has been neutralised - GK analysis judges this position to be equal } a5 {Bolstering the b4 pawn... } 12. Ne3 {While I re-connect my rooks and activate my knight again } Rb8 {? Puts the rook and queen in danger of being forked. It doesn't seem that White can take advantage of that right now, but the tricks up chess players' sleeves are infinite; 13.Bxf6 Nxf6 14.Nxe5! wins a pawn since if 14...dxe5, then simply 15.Bxg4, and if Black takes the bishop on e2 White has the zwischenzug Nc6. Though I do see a way to nab a pawn here, it doesn't appeal to the GK analysis as much... though it is more flashy! :P } 13. Nxg4 Nxg4 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 {A couple of exchanges sets the stage for... } 15. Nd4 {! The line I missed back at move 13 has the same 'discovered attack' motif. My idea was that should Black choose to exchange (which he does) it will be pretty hard to hold on to the d4 pawn. However, Black can complicate; 15...Nxh2!? 16.Rfe1 and there are quite a few ways that Black can proceed here, but I'll just show why 16...exd4 doesn't work; 16...exf4 17.Bb5! [pinning the knight, preventing Ne5] Rxb5 18.Rxe7+ Kxe7 19.Qg5+ Ke8 20.Qxg7 Rf8 21.Kxh2 with advantage to White. If the sac is declined, then the line that Gameknot found plays out [analysis at beginning of this annotation] but sometimes, that analysis confuses me :) } exd4 16. Bxg4 h5 {After I capture on g4, my bishop is immediately chased away... } 17. Rfe1 {... but I can get this move in first! Unfortunately for White, it doesn't lead to the win of the Black queen } Ne5 {Forced... } 18. Bh3 {...and highly recommended! } O-O {Black castles, not only for king safety but also in an attempt to break the pin along the e-file... } 19. f4 {...but White still goes for it! I thought at first that I had managed to win the knight here, but then saw that Black's knight could simply jump to... } Nc4 {...this square with a fork on the d2 queen and the b2 pawn. } 20. Qxd4 {That threat is easily avoided, and White now also attacks the knight. Moreover, his queen is still hanging... } Qc7 {...making this move forced } 21. f5 {White looks to ram this pawn down Black's throat, and plans to play f6 next move. Black will have a hard time dealing with that threat. For example, if Black plays g6, then the White queen makes her was to h6 to deliver mate. If Black exchanges, then Black has a severely weakened kingside. If Black ignores the pawn, then PxP, followed by Qf6 follows - the queen is headed for h8 this time. } Qb6 {! Forces the exchange of queens and neutralises that threat before White can execute it... } 22. Qxb6 {...but being a pawn up, I don't mind the exchange! } Nxb6 {Black had two options here; Rxb6 and Nxb6. The former leaves the b3 pawn threatened, but that threat is easily parried. This option [the better one, I believe] attacks the d5 pawn. A rook can easily defend it... } 23. g3 {! but I choose a more indirect way of defending the pawn, that doesn't tie down my rook to defensive duties. Now, if Nxd5 then White can get a rook and bishop attacking d5, forcing it to move so that the d6 pawn can be captured. } Nxd5 {Nevertheless, Black nabs the pawn - 'when down material, exchange pawns, not pieces.' } 24. Rad1 Nf6 25. Rxd6 Rfc8 {! Black looks towards getting his pawn back - I can't advance my c2 pawn because of the advanced b4 pawn, so the only way I can defend it is by moving a rook back to the second rank. I don't really like that kind of inactivity. } 26. Rd2 {This was chosen over Re2 because the rook on the e-file can potentially penetrate the seventh rank.   } a4 {Continuing the pawn advance, but allowing the seventh-rank intrusion } 27. Re7 Kf8 {Chasing the rook away, but White is more than happy to move his rook... } 28. Ra7 {... though maybe this wasn't the strongest move, even though it targets the a-pawn. Perhaps Rde2 would have been better, solidifying my grip on the e-file. } Rba8 {Defending and threatening the rook... } 29. Rb7 {Creating a fresh threat on the b-pawn... } Ne4 {? Ouch! Black needed that knight to stop the second rook from intruding the seventh ramp, but now White gets to ramp up the pressure even more! I was expecting a rook move to b8, at which point I may have decided to exchange. } 30. Rdd7 {! Now the f-pawn is threatened with capture, making Black's next move forced... Oh, and notice the pretty position of the four rooks! :) } Ng5 31. Bg2 {Since Black's last move threatened my bishop, I retreat it onto the long diagonal. It also threatens to dislodge the knight with h4. } b3 {Since Black's pawn was threatened with capture Black advances it, and I have to deal with the threat of bxa2. Though this will still lose a pawn, it opens up lines for one of Black's rooks. I don't want that, and plan to lock up the position a bit later on... } 32. cxb3 {? But this was the wrong pawn to recapture with! axb3 was much better, according to the GK database. Now that I have opened up a file for the c8 rook... } Rc1+ {... I get hit with this nasty check! } 33. Bf1 {I didn't like the idea of exposing my king with Kf2, so this move was forced in my view. } Nf3+ {! The knight relocates with check, as Black has realised that it can't stay on g5. } 34. Kg2 Ne5 35. Rde7 {White's rook threatens the knight. It can't move away, so it must be defended! f6 won't do since White then pounces at the g7 pawn, so only a rook can do that job... } axb3 {...but first; zwischenzug! White cannot take the knight now because Black can reclaim his queen after bxa2. } 36. a3 {! I didn't want to open the a-file for Black's other rook, so I lock up the position like this instead. Furthermore, since the knight and the pawn are attacked now, White can capture the pawn later, leaving a nice pair of passed pawns. Like I said before, Black needs a rook to defend the knight...  } Rc2+ 37. Kh3 Re8 {?? But this was the wrong way to do it! The colour of the square the rook is on, coupled with Black's back rank weakness allows for the devastating 38.Bb5!!. Black can't play Rxe7 because Rb8+ will mate, if he moves the rook away he loses the knight and if he plays Rc8, he loses the exchange. } 38. Rxe8+ {? White misses it, seeing only the gain of the pawn - 'When you find a good move, always look for a better one!' } Kxe8 {After missing the winning move, my advantage starts to slip away, like trying to hold water. I still have it here, but once Black starts counterattacking I miss the moves required to survive! } 39. Rxb3 Ng4 {! Black threatens the h2 pawn; Though it's an easy threat to meet, suddenly Black has counter-play...  } 40. Bg2 g5 {... as incredibly, the king finds himself caught in a mating net, with the help of two pawns and Black's rook and knight! Though bishops are supposed to be better than knights in the end game, mine actually becomes a problem instead! Nf2# is threatened and if the bishop moves, Black has Rxh2# } 41. fxg6 e.p. {Thank god for the en passant rule... } fxg6 {... but now g5 is threatened all over again! White can still fight off the attack... } 42. Rb5 {?? but not like this! Panicking, I began to hope for the draw, but chess blindness had prevented me from seeing the king could reach h6 [where mate would follow after Nf2+ and Rc4+]. I only saw that after playing this move, and after Black's reply I give up my bishop. The correct move was Rc3, followed by Bc6+ } Kf7 {! } 43. Kh4 Rxg2 44. Kg5 Nxh2 {Now, once two points up, White is now two points down! And unlike Black, there seems to be very little counterplay for White } 45. Rb7+ Ke6 46. Kxg6 {? White should have checked with the rook again so Rxg6 could be played. I was still trying to hold on to my pair of passed pawns and only saw the continuation 46...Rxg3+ 47.Kxh5. } h4 {! An unpleasant surprise; Black uses the pin on the pawn to great effect! } 47. Kh5 {White's king gives chase - as long as Black's last pawn goes, he'll have better hopes for a draw. } hxg3 48. Kh4 Nf1 {In preparation for another move which I miss completely in my desperation to stop the g-pawn... } 49. Kh3 {?? Rg7 was White's last hope! } Rh2+ {!! Now nothing can stop the g-pawn from becoming a queen, and White resigns - well played by my opponent! Since our record is now 1/1/0 (W/L/D) We are currently playing through a third tiebreaker game - keep an eye out for that one! :) }
