1. f4 {This was a tournament game which didn't start badly for me but in the middle game I lost my way and made some blunders that I never recovered from. Please comment particularly on the end game.  The tournament starting position is 1. f4 (Bird's opening)  Analysis is available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18242626&fb=1&rnd=0.07929751090705395} d5 2. Nf3 {This is the Lasker variation} Nf6 3. d4 Bf5 {I like the bishop here though Bg4 is tempting too} 4. e3 e6 5. Bd3 Ne4 6. O-O Bd6 7. Nc3 {This move takes us out of the Gameknot database which has c2,c3 and Ne5 as possibilities} Nd7 {I chose this in preference to Nc6 as it gave the the opportunity of a pawn storm on the queen side in the future} 8. Nb5 Bb4 9. a3 Ba5 10. b4 Bb6 11. Bb2 O-O 12. Ne5 {I'm not sure about this move as it seems to me to achieve nothing more than weakening the defence of the king, and gives my queen free reign over the d8-h4 diagonal, though the computer analysis doesn't object to it} Nxe5 13. fxe5 Qg5 {threatens Bf3} 14. Bxe4 {The computer describes this as an inaccuracy preferring Qe2} Bxe4 {Another inaccuracy according to the computer which prefers Qxe3} 15. Rf2 Qxe3 16. Qe2 Qxe2 17. Rxe2 a6 18. Nc3 Bxd4+ 19. Kf1 Rad8 20. Na4 Ba7 21. Rd1 Bf5 {I think better was Bg6, threatening Bh5 which gains a rook for a bishop} 22. h3 b5 23. Nc5 {Around this point I started to lose direction I wanted to try to keep the bishop pair if I could and needed to open some lines but I couldn't really see how to} a5 24. Nb7 Rd7 25. Nxa5 d4 26. Nc6 Bb6 27. Nxd4 Rfd8 28. c3 c5 29. bxc5 Bxc5 30. Red2 h5 31. Ke1 g5 {The computer calls this a mistake preferring Be4. This is the point where it thinks I lost any lead I may have had} 32. Nxf5 Rd7xd2 33. Rxd2 Rxd2 34. Kxd2 Kh7 {This is a total blunder, I have no idea what I was thinking of and should have taken the knight} 35. Ne3 Kg6 36. c4 Bxe3+ 37. Kxe3 bxc4 38. Kd4 f5 39. exf6 e.p. Kxf6 40. Ke4+ Ke7 {I chose this as I thought any change I may have had would lie in getting over to the other side of the board but I am clearly lost by this point and should have resigned} 41. Ke5 Kd7 42. g3 g4 43. hxg4 hxg4 44. Kf4 Kd6 45. Kxg4 e5 46. Kf5 Kd5 47. Bxe5 Kc5 48. g4 {Thanks for reading please comment}
