[Opening "English (A10), Anglo-Dutch defense"]

1. c4 {White opens up with the English Opening  } f5 {The GK database refers to this as the Anglo-Dutch defence  } 2. Nc3 {Knight development, reinforcing the control over d5  } b6 {?! Black takes a hypermodern approach to the game  } 3. Nf3 {natural...  } Bb7 {again, natural, going through with the fianchetto   } 4. d4 {Since Black, in the last four moves, has decided against grabbing the centre, White is more than happy to do so himself  } Nf6 {More development, and Black is eyeing the d5 square...  } 5. g3 {looks like White is preparing a fianchetto of his own!  } Bxf3 {?! This doubles the pawns and blocks the h1-a8 diagonal...but the problem is, a) White can unblock the diagonal all too easily and b) exchanging a fianchettoed bishop for a knight may not have been the best course of action  } 6. exf3 d5 {the promised pawn to d5... but I remember thinking at this point that I was already not liking Black's position  } 7. Bf4 {Bishop move....   } h6 {And Black immediately acts to attack it  } 8. Bd3 {White brings out his other bishop, and threatens the undefended f5 pawn...  } dxc4 {...so Black turns it into an exchange instead  } 9. Bxc4 g5 {following through with his plan, Black drives away the dark-square bishop...  } 10. Be5 {...but White will not be driven away! he now eyes the knight, and the exchange now (BxN, PXB) leaves the king a little too exposed for my liking  } Bg7 {The obvious move (to me, at least)  } 11. f4 Nc6 {Black catches up with development  } 12. fxg5 {?! Not too sure about this move - it allows Black to open up the h-file for the rook  } hxg5 13. a3 {?! I'm going to guess that White didn't really have a plan of action at this point - there isn't really anything wrong with this move though   } f4 {Hoping for 14.gxf4 gxf4 15.Bxf4 Qxd4 16.Qxd4 Nxd4, relieving a bit of the pressure on Black and putting the knight on a good square  } 14. g4 {Instead, White chooses to close up the queenside pawn structure  } Qd7 {preparing to castle queenside  } 15. f3 {I don't think this move was necessary, since the g-pawn was never threatened, but I guess White wanted to finish the job of closing up the queenside  } Rh3 {?! It's a good idea, I think, but 0-0-0 should have come first...  } 16. Ba6 {! since White prevents it next move!  } e6 {My plan now was to move the king out of the way so that Black could double up on the a-file (it also frees up the f6 knight) However, before I move my king to f7, I wanted to stop any checks from the diagonal (one example would be 16...Kf7 17.Qb3+ e6 18.Bc4  } 17. Qd3 {Bringing out the queen, while maintaining the defence of the f-pawn. However, the word 'defence' is forgotten entirely by both players when Black plays his next move...  } Nxg4 {??! An extremely dangerous move! Black saw and expected White's next move...  } 18. Qg6+ {! ...and he hoped that he could get in an attack for the lost material. However, there were a couple of things that Black overlooked when playing this; a) Black counted on fxg4, but White had other options at his disposal b) after fxg4, Black planned to play Qd5 (to gain a tempo threatening the h1 rook), but didn't spot the c3 knight until afterwards and c) White's attack had the potential to be a lot stronger than Black had forseen...  } Kd8 {Black rejects Ke7 because of the tempo gained with Qxg7+, and instead moves his king to the right. Black also rejects Kf8 because of 19.Qxg7+ Qxg7 20.Bxg7+ Kxg7 21.fxg4, with not enough firepower to justify the sac  } 19. Bxg7 {!? Talking with another player about this position after the game [under the username 'fiver' - he's the reason I sent bluechimera a challenge, actually :)], he recommended that White play 19.Qxg5+ here, which could have been devastating; 19.Qxh5+! Ke8 20.Qxg4; the rook is forced to retreat and Black has no attack. If Black had simply gone ahead with fxg4, Black would play Bxe5  } Nxd4 {?! Now 20.Qxg5+ Ke8 21.Qxg4 is met with ...Nf3+, and then maybe - just maybe - Black can get in a powerful attack on the king (maybe, in this position, fxg4 might have been better! as we see in White's next move, that piece was instrumental in blunting White's attack)  } 20. Bf6+ {? I really don't like this move - it lets Black escape with just a -1 material defect. Maybe White forgot about the knight, and only saw a mating attack - 20.Bf6+ Qe7 21.Qg8#  } Nxf6 21. Qxf6+ Ke8 22. O-O-O {A strange castling situation for White, but logical all the same - threatens the knight and puts the rook on the same file as Black's queen  } Rd8 {the only move to prevent loss of material; I had considered Nb3+, but could not find a sufficient way to carry on the attack  } 23. Qxg5 {Now White takes the g-pawn, though it doesn't have nearly the devastating effect it could have had earlier  } Rxf3 {natural - regaining the lost pawn while defending the hanging one  } 24. Nb5 {?? Ouch! White underestimates the importance of the knight's defence on c3. maybe Rf1 was better here  } Qc6+ {attack!  } 25. Kb1 {This leads to a forced mate, done in style!... but what were the other variations? a) 25.Kd2 Qc2+ 26.Ke1 Qf2# b) [but what if White defends with] 25.Nc3 Rxc3+! [the rook can't be taken because of 26...Qxc3+ 27.Kb1 Qc2+ 28.Ka1 Nb3], then 26.Kd2 Nf3+ 27.Ke2 Qe4+ 28.Kf2 Rc2+ 29.Kf1 Rxd1# c) [and the one to prevent mate] 25.Nc3 Rxc3+! 26.Kb1 Rxa3 [threatens mate; the rook can't be taken for the same reason mentioned before] 27.Rd2 Rxa6 [with a won game for Black] and d)....  } Qc2+ 26. Ka2 Rf2 {! Black threatens mate, and the only way that White can stop it lets Black have another mate  } 27. Rdb1 {now that White's king has been boxed in, Black launches the final assault  } Qb3+ 28. Ka1 Nc2# {checkmate! as I've said before, my attack was one of extremely high risk, but it's so satisfying when they pay off, isn't it? (a pretty mate as well! :) )  }
