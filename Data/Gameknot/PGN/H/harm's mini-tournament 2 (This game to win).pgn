1. c4 {I needed to win this game to seal the tournament. I decided to go for an English opening, not one of my favs i have to say but i wanted to go with something different this time round.} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. e3 {E3 looking to create that big center and dominate...} g6 {fianchetto kings bishop (kings indian defence) a solid enough dfence and if the game becomes open this bishop can create strong threats on the a1- h8 diagonal..} 4. d3 {I decided not to go straight to d4, some may say i wasted my time stopping at d3 but i quite like it, just a personal thing...} Bg7 5. Be2 O-O 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. O-O d6 8. a3 Be6 9. e4 {A big decision d4 or e4, i wanted to open the queens bishop diagonal having made up my mind to trade knights on d4 if he plunged his in there...} h6 {A good move...} 10. Be3 Ne7 11. Qd2 c6 12. h3 d5 {Now i feel a little like i'm losing the initiative here as he decides to make the first move in the center but i have a nice pincer movement going on on c4 and e4...} 13. Bxh6 {of course if your opponent goes to the center it could be a good time to attack elsewhere and vice versa....} dxe4 {Not distracted one jot!!} 14. Nxe5 {so i make headway towards his knig in the hope of an early all out attack....} exd3 {Fair enough....} 15. Nxd3 {Maybe Bxd3 was better here...} Bxc4 {Hmmm....} 16. Bxg7 {I thought it was the best time to take out one of his monarchs key defenders......} Kxg7 17. Rad1 Bb3 18. Rde1 {I start to get a bit bogged down here with annoying and effective rook threats...} Re8 19. f3 {I wanted a out post for my c3 knight but i had to concede the d1-h5 diagonal but that wasn't to bad a concession....} Qb6+ {Again another irritating threat but any all out attack was pretty far of i thought for him....} 20. Kh1 Rad8 21. Qg5 Nf5 22. Ne4 {this is where i formulated a plan for a checkmate, i wanted him to take this knight so i could open the f file for my rook and queen to link up and couse real threats...} Nxe4 {And he obliged as i hoped he would, this is i would say his real mistake in the game but i guess he felt he was ok....} 23. fxe4 {Another big blunder is about to follow....} Rxe4 {Fatal....} 24. Rxf5 {Now he is looking defeat right in the face and i think the damage is now terminal} Rxe2 {??? ....} 25. Rxe2 {Cheers....} Rxd3 {Time to go in for the kill.....} 26. Qf6+ Kf8 27. Qh8# {A fine finish to a nice little mate. I have to concede the opponents rating is over 100 below my own but i don't think he played badly although the mistakes that he did make were terminal! i still think it is a well played game and a pretty mate...Cheers, thanks for reading and any comments would be appreciated.
