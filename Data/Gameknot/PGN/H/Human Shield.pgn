1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This game was part of the Sicilian Pelikan themed MT started by Concordborn.  It was a victory against an opponent with an optimum rating of 1903.  This is a long game spanning 69 moves.  I managed to be a pawn up in a Q & P ending and to shepherd my extra pawn to Glendadom.  Meanwhile, Henry had to run the gauntlet from the Wicked Witch of the West.  He did this by using an enemy pawn as a Human Shield.  After that, his two wives then covered him, aaaah!  Once the checks ran out my opponent waved the white flag.  Here is how it happened, folks - firstly here is the Gameknot Analysis.   http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17526707&rnd=0.10930306846589815} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - the standard pawn trade.} Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 {7. Bg5 - pin.  This threatens BxN forcing PxB because if QxB?? then Nc7+.} a6 8. Na3 b5 {8....... b5 - threatening b4 forking the two knights.} 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 {10. .... Bxf6 - B for N trade.} 11. c3 Bg5 12. Nc2 O-O 13. a4 bxa4 14. Rxa4 {14. Rxa4 - pawn trade.  This pawn trade gives black a weak pawn on a6.  Such a trade happened in my game against Concordborn called Breakthrough which I went on to win.  } Bb7 15. Bc4 Kh8 16. h4 Bf6 17. Nxf6 Qxf6 {17. ...... Qxf6 - N for B trade.} 18. Qg4 Ne7 19. f3 d5 20. exd5 Nxd5 21. Bxd5 Bxd5 {21. ...... Bxd5 - another set of minor pieces plus a pawn have been traded.  Will black's bishop be better than my knight?  We shall see.} 22. Ne3 Be6 23. Qg3 Rfd8 24. O-O {24. 0-0 - I remember castling late in the Concordborn game in which Coach Ion said that in this variation white was too busy to castle.  It is certainly time to get a rook into play, particularly with a BR controlling the d column.} Rd3 25. Ng4 Bxg4 26. Rxg4 {26. Rxg4 - the minor pieces have been traded off and I now have pressure on the g column.} Qb6+ 27. Kh1 Qf6 28. Re1 {28. Re1 - and now the e5 pawn comes under the hammer.} Re8 29. Rge4 {29. Rge4 - pile on.} Rd5 30. f4 Qb6 31. b4 f6 {31. ..... f6 - black tries to save his pawn but to no avail.} 32. fxe5 fxe5 33. Re4xe5 Rexe5 34. Rxe5 Rd1+ 35. Re1 {35. Re1 - blocking the check.  Black now backs up his rook and covers his back row.} Qd8 36. Rxd1 Qxd1+ {36. ..... Qxd1+ - now the rooks have been traded off we have a Q and P ending but with me a pawn up, I will win this but boy I am gonna be in for the long haul.} 37. Kh2 h6 38. Qb8+ Kh7 39. Qb6 Qe1 40. Qd4 {40. Qd4 - and even in this endgame, Glenda is put to do a lot of defending - poor put upon lady!} Qe2 41. c4 {41. c4 - it will be this pawn that will crown, however.  Only another 4 squares to go, but they will be tortuous steps.} Qc2 42. c5 {42. c5 - make that 3.} Qc1 43. Qe4+ Kh8 44. c6 {44. c6 - only 2 to go.} Qc3 45. Kg1 Qc1+ 46. Kf2 {46. Kf2 - Henry is eyeing up the top of the board.  He intends to seek shelter there against any checks from the Wicked Witch.} Kg8 47. Qd5+ Kh7 48. Qd3+ Kh8 49. Qd8+ Kh7 50. c7 {50. c7 - a series of queen checks enables my pawn to be just one square from Glendadom.  But now Henry must run the gauntlet from the Wicked Witch of the West.} Qf4+ 51. Kg1 Qe3+ 52. Kh2 Qf4+ 53. Kh3 Qf5+ 54. Kg3 {54. Kg3 - Henry hatches his escape plan.} Qe5+ 55. Kf3 Qc3+ 56. Ke2 Qe5+ 57. Kd3 {57. Kd3 - Henry makes towards his queenside footman but will this be shelter enough?} Qb5+ 58. Kc3 Qe5+ 59. Kc4 Qb5+ 60. Kb3 {60. Kb3 - whew - at last Henry has found some refuge as the Witch has no checking lines available.  Any non checking move will allow my c7 pawn to crown.} a5 61. c8=Q {61. c8/Q - Voila!} Qxb4+ 62. Kc2 {62. Kc2 - Henry must run the gauntlet yet again.  At least with two queens on the board, it will be easier to cover Henry as more squares will be controlled by both these ladies.  I just hope I can engineer a cross-check which will force off the Witch.} Qa4+ 63. Kd3 Qd1+ 64. Kc4 {64. Kc4 - with both queens defending each other, Henry has no fear of running into a skewer.} Qc1+ 65. Kb5 Qb2+ 66. Ka6 {66. Ka6! - Henry was really tempted to gobble up that nice, tasty, juicy p(r)awn on a5.  But he restrains himself from this because he realises that he can use this pawn as a human shield to shelter behind.  Black cannot now check Henry from the front, so he must now find another way.} Qe2+ 67. Ka7 Qf2+ 68. Qb6 {68. Qb6 - After being on this square for many moves, Glenda is finally able to cover her other half.} Qf7+ 69. Qcb7 {69. Qcb7 - and so does her clone, Henry is sooo lucky, having those two ladies to snuggle up to.  My opponent acknowledges that Henry is now safe and all I have to do is to plonk a queen on the b1 to a7 diagonal when the Witch moves off her second rank and I will either force an exchange of queens or if black dodges this exchange he can cop Old Matey.  This acknowledgement comes in the form of the white flag.  This puts me back to my optimum rating of 1883 just 17 points short of 1900.  Be really lurvely to get there.  But for now, that's all folks, bye for now - Joanne}
