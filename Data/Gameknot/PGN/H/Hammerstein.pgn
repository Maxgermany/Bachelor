1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. f4 exf4 4. e5 Ne4 5. Qh5 g6 6. Qg4 Qe7 7. Qxf4 Nc5 8. Nc3 Bg7 9. Nh3 d6 {Mm, I like BxPe5 much better here.  White must then move the queen, and black has an opportunity to pick off some piece for free, potentially, with discovered check (by moving the bishop). } 10. e6 {Here BxPe6 is probably best.} fxe6 11. d4 e5 12. Bb5+ {Black will wish to interpose Pc7.} Bd7 {That is probably ok too.} 13. Qf3 {Oh, now Pe5xPd4+ lets black seize Nc3.} Rf8 {Interesting.} 14. Nd5 {Nice counter threat.} Qh4+ {The trouble with this response is that g3 means black must move the queen, and white leaps in for black's a rook with NxPc7+.  Well, g3, Q (or Bd7) x Nh3, then 16. NxPc7+.  White trades a knight for a rook and pawn.  Wait, skip all that.  White's queen is still under threat.} 15. g3 Qxh3 16. Nf6+ {Right--black must choose BxNf6 or RxNf6.} Bxf6 {Bishop it is.} 17. Qa3 {Nothing is protecting Bb5 or Pd4.  } Bxb5 18. dxc5 Nc6 {I'm partial to Qg2 here instead.  Threaten white's rook, but white can't protect it without Qe2#.} 19. Rf1 {???  QxRf1+ is highly recommended here.  20. Kd2, Qe2+, 21. Kc3, Pe4+...} Qxh2 {White must protect e2 from Qe2#.} 20. Rxf6 {That bishop is not worth a rook.  But black here must be eye balling Qe2#.} Rxf6 {Nope.  Qe2#.  The rook is not worth the white king.} 21. Qb3 {Ok, here is a suggestion--Rf1#.  Mix it up a bit--let the rook see some more action.  Black has a tough decision to make...} Qe2# {}
