1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. Qf3 e6 {There's no way I am going to fall for that.  I think is more orthodox than kn-h6} 4. d3 Nd4 {just an inconvenience to get the queen moved} 5. Qd1 {so that has proved white's opening was a waste of time} d5 6. Bb3 Nxb3 7. axb3 {got a double up on pawns for the future} dxe4 8. Nh3 exd3 9. cxd3 {now got a break in white pawn defence} e5 10. O-O Bxh3 11. Qf3 {expected g3 } Bf5 {my first mistake} 12. Qxf5 f6 {attempt to secure up e5} 13. Ra5 {ah thats a better mistake} Qxa5 14. Qe6+ Ne7 15. Bd2 Qa2 16. Bc3 Rd8 17. Qc4 b6 18. Nd2 Nd5 19. Nb1 Nxc3 {worth the exchange to remove the bishop defending b2} 20. Qxc3 b5 {c5 is protected so b-pawn can advance} 21. Rc1 b4 22. Qc4 Be7 {should of gone qxb2} 23. Qc2 O-O {but this open the rooks on d} 24. Nd2 Rd4 25. Nf3 Rd5 26. Nd2 Rfd8 {now able to build pressure on d3}
