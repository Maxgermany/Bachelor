1. e4 {The british grandmaster John Nunn is 51 years of age, but in the next game against the 21 year old dutch grandmaster Jan Smeets, he shows he can still play...Taken from the fourth round of the NH Chess tournament played at Hotel Krasnapolsky in the heart of Amsterdam.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {The Ruy Lopez, Berlin defence.} 4. d3 {According to Nunn, he was trying to play the opening 'safe' in this tournament. This explains the chosen setup, wich actually gives white only small chances at getting the advantage.} Bc5 {Now some interesting tactical play follows.} 5. O-O d6 6. c3 O-O 7. Nbd2 Bd7 8. h3 a6 9. Ba4 Ba7 10. Re1 Ne7 11. Bb3 Ng6 12. Nf1 h6 13. Ng3 c6 14. d4 Qc7 15. Be3 Rfe8 16. Qd2 exd4 17. Bxd4 Bxd4 18. cxd4 c5 19. Rac1 b6 20. Qc3 Qb7 21. dxc5 dxc5 22. e5 Nd5 23. Qd2 Ndf4 24. Rc4 {!? More obvious would be to play 24.Ne4 and white would have a better position.} Ne6 {!? White was trying to provoke 24...Nxh3  25.gxh3 Qxf3 26.Qxd7 Nxe5 27.Rxe5 Rxe5 and it would be unclear postition. It seems black should have taken the challenge, because in the current position he'll soon be overplayed by his opponent.} 25. Ne4 {(Threatens to fork the queen and rook.)} Qc7 26. Nf6+ {!! A very nice sacrifice, deeply calculated by Nunn.} gxf6 27. Qxh6 f5 {There's not much choice here, after 23...fxe5 white plays 28.Rg4.} 28. Nh4 {! Threatens to take the defender on g6 followed by Rh4 and black can't stop the mate.} Bb5 {Black clears the seventh row, so the queen can become involved in the defence. But there's more....} 29. Nxf5 {!} Rad8 {After the game Nunn showed the following amazing line:  29...Bxc4 30.Bxc4 Nxe5 31.Re4 Ra-d8 32.Rh4 Rd1 33.Bf1 f6 34.Qh8  Kf7  35. Rh7  Kg6 36.Nh4  Kg5 37.Rh5  Kf4 38.Qxf6  Ke4 39.Rxe5  Qxe5 40.Qf3  Kd4 41.Qxd1  Ke4 42.Qf3  Kd4 43.Qd3 mate! That's some deep calculating going on there :)} 30. Rg4 c4 31. Bc2 {31.Rg5! cxb3 32.Rh5 would have been faster.} Rd5 32. Rh4 {!! Threatening a queen sacrifice: 33.Qh7  Kf8 34.Qh8 ! Nxh8 35.Rxh8 mate, or if black tries 32...Nxh4, white plays 33.Ne7 ! Qxe7 34.Qh7  Kf8 35.Qh8 and it's also mate.(leaving white a rook and two pieces behind in material!)  1-0}
