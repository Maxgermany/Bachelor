1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {The Evans Gambit, a difficult line for Black to defend.} Bxb4 {Black accepts the challenge.} 5. c3 Bc5 6. d4 exd4 7. cxd4 {White's center is formidable, and the coming B-R3 will make Black's development, in particular castling, difficult.} Bb6 8. O-O Na5 {Black tries to counter aggressively by attacking White's Bishop.} 9. Bd3 d5 {Black does need to weaken White's center, but this opens up the game prematurely. With his King in the center, Black should be looking to keep the game closed.} 10. exd5 Qxd5 11. Ba3 {Now Black's King will be caught in the crossfire.} Be6 12. Nc3 Qd7 {Black is still hoping to castle Queen-side, but White's pressure is relentless.} 13. d5 Bxd5 14. Nxd5 Qxd5 {15 R-K1ch would leave Black defenseless. But White misses the move, his first mistake of the game.} 15. Bb5+ Qxb5 16. Re1+ Ne7 {White should follow up with 17 RxNch.} 17. Rb1 {His second and final mistake. But Black misses the saving move: 17... Q-Q2! would put up a fight.} Qa6 {Now Black's fate is sealed. White's final attack is exemplary.} 18. Rxe7+ Kf8 19. Qd5 {Threatens QxBP mate.} Qc4 {Black stops this...} 20. Rxf7+ Kg8 21. Rf8# {...but is mated anyway.}
