1. d4 {This is a game at the Dutch youth championship. I'm black and play against an opponent with a rating of 2080. My rating then was 1520 (Although it should be about 1800 I think). After the opening I'm standing worse, and start to play for a draw, at which I succeed in the end.} Nf6 {I'm still trying to find a way to play against 1.d4 which I like. I've tried several things and at the time I played King Indian. I didn't really know much of the opening and I now play differently against d4 (Albin Counter gambit).} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Bg5 {Up to this point I new how to play, but this move was a bit new for me. I played c5 here since after e5, the normal move most of the times, 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Nd5 black is clearly worse and already losing material. } c5 7. d5 e6 {I believe the main line runs 7. ... h6, but I didn't know that, and this move seemed good. } 8. Qd2 exd5 9. exd5 Re8 10. Nf3 Bg4 {I knew that because of this move I would have to exchange my bishop for a knight, I didn't see anything else. I don't think it's a bad move because the knight could be more usefull in this position because of the linked pawns. Also, I needed to bring my bishop out and exchange pieces because my position is a bit cramped.} 11. O-O Nbd7 12. h3 Bxf3 13. Bxf3 Nb6 {I needed a plan here, but didn't really have one. Nb6 isn't a good move as the knight doesn't really do anything on b6. perhaps better was Qb6, perhaps followed by doubling the rooks on the e-file.} 14. Be2 Qd7 15. Bd3 Na4 {Trying to trade more pieces. White can't really since I don't think he wants the double c-pawn. } 16. Nxa4 Qxa4 17. b3 Qd7 {Perhaps a better idea here wasn Qb4. After 18. Qxb4 cxb4 and idea for me is Nf6-d7-c5 and my bishop and knight are actively placed. I don't think the I'm worse then. A drawback of Qd7 is that my knight less room. } 18. Rae1 Rxe1 {I think I shouldn't have traded the rooks, but first do Qc7. This creates the possibility Nf6-d7-e5. I don't need to hurry to trade the rooks.} 19. Rxe1 Re8 20. Kf1 Nh5 {I should've played Rxe1 here and after that Qc7 and the knight manouvre. Nh5 is rather useless and only give white time to get a better position. } 21. Rxe8+ Qxe8 22. g4 Nf6 23. Qf4 Qe7 {Now the knight can't go to d7 because the pawn on d6 was attacked. My position is getter and from this moment I'm only playing for a draw. } 24. a4 {This was a bad move as it blocks the queenside. I can now close the queenside which in the later endgame helps me getting a draw.} b6 25. f3 Qe5 {Perhaps I first should've done a5 here to completely block the queen side because later he can use the fact that it isn't completely blocked.} 26. Qxe5 dxe5 {My hopes for a draw were big now. My plan was the moves h6, g5, Nf6-e8-d6, f6, and a5. If I would get the time for that, it would be a complete draw. } 27. Ke2 h6 {I think a5 might have been better here. I thought that h6 would give me the time to also close the kingside, but I didn't see the next move.} 28. Bd2 {This threatens to break open the queenside, so I need to close that. This gives white the time to try something.} a5 29. f4 {With this move, white might get some opportunities. I still think it's a draw, but two moves ago I thought, that it was all certain already.} Nd7 30. Kf3 Kf8 31. Ke4 Ke7 32. fxe5 Nxe5 33. Bxh6 {I hadn't seen this coming, but I don't think it's that good. I lose a pawn, but I can also exchange a piece after which a draw get closer.} Bxh6 {Nxd3 was far worse. After 34. Bxg7 Nc1 35. h4 Nxb3 36. h5 white is winning. } 34. Kxe5 Bg7+ 35. Ke4 {I didn't understand why he went to e4 as he goes to f4 the next move, but I don't now if it mattered anymore.} Bf6 {If I can exchange all the kingside pawns, it a draw. I put my king on d6 and my bishop moves along the d8-h4 diagonal and white can't get through. So my plan was to exchange pawns. Just don't really do anything and till white plays his pawns up the board.} 36. Kf4 Bh4 37. g5 Be1 38. Kg4 Bd2 39. h4 Bc3 40. h5 gxh5+ 41. Kxh5 {One pair of pawns is gone.} Bd2 {I moved my bishop here to bind the king to the defence of the g-pawn and also set a trap to make it a permanent draw....} 42. Kg4 {And he falls for the trap. It was a draw anyway, but he might have tried something with Be3-h7-g8. After that, I just move my bishop to the b8-h2 diagonal.} f6 {Now what stand for the choice: exchange, and the already mentioned draw appears or move ahead.} 43. g6 Bh6 44. Kf5 Bg7 {And after this move, white can't get through. I just moved my kink from e7 to d6 and nothing happens anymore. He still plays more then 13 moves, I think because of the rating difference. } 45. Be4 Kd6 46. Bf3 Ke7 47. Bg4 Kd6 48. Ke4 Bh8 49. Bc8 Bg7 50. Be6 Ke7 51. Kf4 Kd6 52. Kf5 Ke7 53. Ke4 Kd6 54. Kd3 Ke7 55. Bg4 Kd6 56. Bd1 Ke5 57. Bf3 Kd6 {And a draw was agreed. Please give comments and this game, and I hope you enjoyed it.}
