1. e4 {This game was played on Yahoo Chess; Ax2kool being me and a4det2008 being white. } e5 {I choose to play a open game. } 2. Nc3 {Okay, I wasn't so familiar with this line. I had no clue what to do. I know...I have been playing against Nf3 a lot :$. } Nf6 {I chose to do what looked logical to me} 3. h3 {Seems like white wants to restrict black knights movements but this move i think i premature. } d5 {Idea of centralizing my knight} 4. exd5 Nxd5 5. Nxd5 {? I did not understand this. Now, I have a tempo to bring my Queen out and develop faster than white. } Qxd5 6. c4 {Trying to attack my queen, I did not know this opening, so i chose to play what looked logical. } Qe4+ 7. Ne2 {Not Be7 because Qxg2. But Qe2 would have been the best and given white the tempo. } Nc6 8. f3 {hmm after this move, i directly looked at g3 square. I hoped to utilize it somehow after i displace the knight somehow. } Qg6 {This move was done because after Nb4, there is no defence against Nc2} 9. a3 {Naturally he saw that, but did he see the threat on g3?} Bf5 {I continue to threathen the c2 square} 10. d3 {This move allows me to amplify my attacks all the more} O-O-O {! Now I have three pieces aiming d3 pawn} 11. Nc3 {? This move leaves g3 square unguarded. Thank you very much.} Qg3+ {I use the square. } 12. Kd2 {Forced. } Qf2+ {! Not taking the pawn right away because the bishop is guarding it. } 13. Ne2 {Qe2 helps white live a little bit longer} Rxd3+ {obvious continuation} 14. Kc2 Re3+ {Rxd1 would give white a definite advantage but I thought of finishing the game instead. } 15. Kd2 {Forced} Bb4+ {! Sacrifice of the bishop, white must take, there is no alternative} 16. axb4 Rd8# {!! There are 7 squares between the rook and the stranded king! I had 3 seconds left on the clock when i made this move. }
