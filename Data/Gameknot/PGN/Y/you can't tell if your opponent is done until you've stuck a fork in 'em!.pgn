1. c4 {In this game, you'll see how pins and forks undo white.} g6 2. Nf3 Bg7 3. d4 e6 4. g3 Ne7 5. Nc3 d5 6. Bg2 O-O {ho-hum...pretty generic up to here, folks.} 7. c5 Nbc6 8. e3 b6 9. a3 Ba6 {this seemingly innocuous move proves to trouble white for most of the match.} 10. b4 {white is planning a 11.b5, forking black's pieces on c6 and a6.} Bc4 {nullifying the threat of the fork while maintaining the line. the only drawback is that if white plays 11.b5, black's wB has no retreating square.} 11. b5 Na5 12. Nd2 {white is planning 13.NxB NxN 14.0-0, allowing black's N to penetrate deep into his territory for the sake of his K's protection.} bxc5 {this move reveals the pin placed on the pawn at d4. white cannot play 13.PxP since 13....BxN, forking the a1 R and pinning the remaining N against his K.    better is 13.NxB NxN 14.0-0 PxP 15.PxP c5 16.PbxPc NxP, which leaves white only a pawn down, but room to maneuver.} 13. Nf3 { white retreats to protect the exposed weakness at d4.} cxd4 {black makes the most of the advantage.} 14. exd4 c6 {better is 14....c5! 15.Be3 PxP 16.BxP BxB 17.NxB (17.QxB loses to 17....Nb3!, forking R adn Q) e5 18.Nde2 d4 19.Ne4 Rb8 (BxP loses to 20.Nf6+ Kh1 21.BxR QxB) 20.0-0 Nf5} 15. a4 a6 16. Rb1 Nf5 17. Ba3 Re8 18. Bc5 axb5 {black initiates the trading...} 19. axb5 cxb5 20. Nxb5 Qd7 21. Bf1 Bxf1 {black's wB has done its job - preventing white from castling. as an extra boon, close examination of the board shows a weakness to a N fork at d2, regardless if white plays 22.KxB or 22.RxB} 22. Kxf1 {even better for black since d2 has 1 less defender.} Reb8 23. Nc3 Rxb1 24. Qxb1 {white's pieces are exactly where black needs them to be for a devastating fork, but he's 2 moves out from execution, and he still must remove the f3 N.} Nc4 {just in case white makes a mistake.} 25. h4 {white counters with a non-committal move. better would have been 25.Kf2, freeing the R to join the Q} Nxd4 {black iniates the trade to entice white's N to retaliate and move from its post.} 26. Nxd4 {white takes the bait...} Nd2+ 27. Kg2 Nxb1 28. Rxb1 {28....BxN 21.BxB, while putting him at a material advantage, actually has less ammunition to fight this battle. instead, something to even the odds a bit....} e5 {black needs white's N out of the way, so...} 29. Ndb5 {a hanging B. and a N in the way....white calls up the peasants once again...} d4 30. Ne4 {black could have played 30....Qd5, thus pinning the N and winning it with 31....f5 32....PxN. this line however, concedes initiative to white, so to keep white reeling...} f5 {this move allows black to check with a single move while maintaining initiative.} 31. Nd2 Qd5+ 32. f3 Qxc5 {white cedes the board to black since 33....Rb8 yields black a N.}
