1. e4 {Alright i recently played in a different chess site with a friend: Sicilian dragon variation yugoslav attack and i am excited to show you how i proceeded with the yugoslav attack. I am white,my friend is black. The point of this game is to give you some inspiration to when you face the sicilian dragon variation. We both had 10 mins each in time.} c5 {c5 is the sicilian and it can lead to all sorts of positions.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 {and he played g6. When your opponent plays g6 you can be sure that he will play the sicilian dragon even tho it is more common to play 4. ... Nf6 first and then play g6 after 5. Nc3 g6.} 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. f3 {f3 is just to prevent the knight from coming to g4 and protecting e4.} O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4 {okay,this is how the yugoslav attack looks like,place your pieces exactly like i have done.} e6 {i dont like that move. i dont think it's good for black, he should maybe play the chinese dragon variation by playing Rb8,a6,b5 or Bd7,Rc8,Ne5,Qa5 etc.} 10. O-O-O Bd7 11. h4 {now i started the attack with h4. } Ne5 {i suppose this is a move you can do because this is black wanting to get the light squared bishop.} 12. Bb3 Rc8 {planning the move Nc4} 13. Bh6 {ok this is another move in the yugoslav attack,exchange the dark squared bishop and then open up the h-file somehow and move in with the queen to h6.} Nc4 {okey he wants to tackle the queen away and stop the yugoslav attack but i dont want that of course so i surrender my light squared bishop.} 14. Bxc4 Rxc4 15. Bxg7 {it's better for white if the black bishop takes his own bishop instead to gain tempo but you can play this move as well.} Kxg7 16. g4 {playing h5 immediately wouldn't help since he can just take the pawn with the knight so playing this move helps white a lot.} a6 {a6 can be played earlier in the game but then it would be named dragjorf i think lol. you know instead of e6 he can play a6 and then b5.} 17. h5 {okey now i played h5. i think it's better for black to open up the h-file than the g-file by letting me capture his pawn instead.} b5 18. hxg6 {so now i opened up the h-file} fxg6 19. Qh6+ {since now the rook is supporting my queen i can finally move her to h6 just like in the yugoslav attack.} Kf7 {Now i had like 4 mins left and i wasn't sure how to play but i think i played the best move here...} 20. g5 {i think now white is having a winning position} b4 {well he had like 6 mins here and he wasn't sure how to play either but exchanging the knights make it more dangerous for black as you will see.} 21. gxf6 bxc3 22. Qg7+ {penetrating to the 7th rank.} Ke8 23. Rxh7 {okey black needs to stop white from playing Qxg6 (wins)} cxb2+ {he checks me as a first try.} 24. Kb1 {errr i dont think black will win either if i take the pawn but  not taking the pawn and using it as a shelter (almost as if white coverts the pawn to his side) is probably the best move to speed things up} Qxf6 {okey he took my pawn,i guess he wanted to stop me from taking his g6 pawn also. and so i decided to make a queen exchange...} 25. Qxd7# {...no i am joking of course xD. so this is how the yugoslav attack might look like, and i think if black hadn't taken the pawn at f6 i would have mated him anyways.}
