1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Right now, in the middle of a Big Freeze, we are all getting ready for Christmas.  Well, here is a little winter-warmer for you.  This is now Expert Draw No. 12 and if Dave, my opponent had just 17 points more on his rating it would have been my third Master Draw.  Still, I am pleased with the result as I got canned by Dave with the black pieces.  So, how did all this come about?  Well, read on.  Gameknot analysis is provided with the following link:http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14973101&rnd=0.09016686302708665} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 5. Nxf7 Bxf2+ 6. Kf1 {6. Kf1 - this has been my stock move of the tournament and has yielded mixed results for me.} Qe7 7. Nxh8 d5 8. exd5 Nd4 {8. ...... Nd4 - the black minor pieces start swarming in and it will not be long before they will be joined by the Wicked Witch of the West!} 9. d6 Qxd6 10. Nf7 {10. Nf7 - my knight makes a bid for freedom!} Qc5 11. Nxe5 Qxe5 12. c3 {12. c3 - tries to chase away the knight but now Dave develops his lsb in order to menace Glenda on d1.} Bg4 13. cxd4 {13. cxd4 - I get rid of that pesky knight and menace the Wicked Witch at the same time.  With a 6 point deficit in material Dave is quite correct in avoiding the exchange of queens!} Qxd4 14. Qa4+ Kf8 {14. ..... Kf8 - was expecting a move like Bd7 here but then black likes to keep the pressure on Henry.} 15. Bb5 {15. Bb5 - Fou Leblanc moves to try and stop Re8 and offers another exchange of queens.  Black could keep the Witch on the g1-a7 diagonal but Glenda can get in a nice nuisance check on the a3-f8 diagonal.  Black moves his queen onto the e column threatening Qe1# but Henry decided to rid himself of black's dsb.} Qe5 16. Kxf2 Qf5+ 17. Ke1 {17. Ke1 - If it were not for the fact that the Wicked Witch of the West can check Henry ad infinitum on the e and f files I would be looking forward to my first ever Expert Victory in a non-timed out game with an 8 point material advantage.  However, Dave does have Ye Olde Perpetualle up his sleeve so I offered him a draw and he accepted.  Gameknot Analysis seemed to back up my decision.}
