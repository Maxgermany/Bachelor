[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 d6 {I am not used to d6 defence, hence from here on, I did whatever seemed natural to me. } 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {A sort of KID set up? So i assume that my opponent is going to castle on king side. I commence my attack without delay.} 4. Bd3 {The ideas behind my play in this game are very simple. Starting with this move - I simply place the bishop on a diagonal that may be useful in attacking the king later. } Bg7 {KID setup - ish...i was right!} 5. Nf3 {Developing. Better than Nge2 because I can now use Ng5 square to attack the king. } O-O 6. h3 {This is not to stop Bg4, that pin is useless. Bg4 h3, Bxf3 Qxf3 etc and white has a more pieces out in the open. The idea behind this move is just pawn expansion on king side} c5 7. Be3 {The previous move allows me to do this move without worrying about Ng4} b6 {hmm, not sure how useful this move is. Black should focus more on developing pieces here. } 8. Qd2 {idea is to castle queen side and launch a quick attack on black's king} Re8 {Don't know what black is doing. Nbd7 looks good here with idea of cxd4 and then Nc5...} 9. O-O-O {Natural...white is ready to launch an attack} a5 {black's counter attack. I see that the pawns are too far away to threaten my knight right away..hence i begin expanding making threats of my own.  } 10. g4 Ba6 {This move is troublesome because if the black bishop takes my white bishop...my queen will be displaced from line of fire :P  (i.e. the c1 - h6 diagonal). Hence, i have to take the bishop first but I still have time to do some damage on the king side. } 11. g5 {simple. displaces the knight and allows h4} Nfd7 12. Bxa6 {the idea previously discussed} Rxa6 13. h4 {yup. } b5 {now this is troublesome...the pawns have closed in now...} 14. h5 {I keep attacking. b4 here can be answered with Na4 or Ne2. In terms of pawn threats, white is still winning. } Nc6 15. hxg6 {opens the h file} fxg6 16. Qe2 {the idea here is to attack the b5 pawn and preventing b4. } Qc7 {maybe he's planning Qxb5 Rb6 and thus attacking my b2 pawn...} 17. Qxb5 {But i go ahead and take it anyways because I notice that after this move I have Qc4+ } Rb6 {as predicted} 18. Qc4+ {Now the queen can infiltrate the black kingdom } Kh8 19. Qf7 {easy and dangerous...black is running out of options Rook is being threatened and Qxg6 is also a possibility } Nd8 {This doesn't stop anything...} 20. Rxh7+ {BAM! K0! Kxh7 forced. Rh1+ seals the game after that} Kxh7 21. Rh1# {Good game Mr. Docrabax. See you in Hell :D}
