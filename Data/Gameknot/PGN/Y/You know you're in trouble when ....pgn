1. e4 {This is from a Ruy Lopez tournament. I haven't played the Ruy since the mid-70s.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 {This isn't really an uncommon move, but it's unusual in that normally Black would castle and get his king out of the center. The challenge for White is to take advantage of his lead in development to get the pawn back and more.} 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 {I don't think he wants to capture on d4 because my rook can pin his knight.} 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Be3 Be7 10. Nbd2 {I'd like to trade that knight of his. It's in a strong position, and it makes it hard for me to guard the pawn on e5.} Nc5 11. Ng5 Bxg5 12. Bxc5 {I like that trade. I can replace the knight that was sitting on f3, I get rid of a knight that threatened my light-colored bishop, and I keep him from castling kingside.} Bf4 13. Nf3 Nxe5 14. Re1 {If he moves the knight, then I win the pawn on d5.} Qf6 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 16. a4 O-O-O {I don't think he had much choice. He had to get out of the middle, but the queenside isn't safe either.} 17. axb5 Bxb2 18. Rxa6 {Lots of threats coming there. I keep looking at when can I play Bxd5 or Ba4 or clear out the b-file and come down that way.} Bc3 19. Re3 {Or attack on the c-file.} Be5 20. b6 {I especially like this move. The king's soon to be on his own.} cxb6 21. Bxb6 Rd7 22. Ra8+ Bb8 23. Bd4 {Now I'll be able to play Rc3! You know you're in trouble when all of the pawns in front of your king disappear and your pieces are on the other side of the board.} Qh6 24. Be5 {}
