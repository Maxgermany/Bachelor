1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nd4 4. Nxd4 exd4 5. d3 h6 6. c3 a6 7. Ba4 b5 8. Bb3 Bc5 9. O-O Nf6 10. Bf4 d6 11. f3 {This is the losing move.  White would have done much better to capture the d-pawn and follow Bxd4 with Nc3. } g5 {Good move, increasing the pressure the Black d-pawn holds on white's Queen-side.} 12. Bg3 {White needs to loosen up the Queen-side by getting his knight in play.  Nd2 iis not desirable. dxc3+ loses the knight.  Bd2 would not have been helpful either.  With dxc3+ White's response will be followed with cxb2 and the rook falls anyway--just as with Bg3.  The best move is withdrawing the Bishop to its home square.   } dxc3+ 13. Bf2 cxb2 14. Nc3 bxa1=Q 15. Qxa1 Bxf2+ 16. Rxf2 Be6 17. Nd5 Bxd5 18. Bxd5 Nxd5 {White can regain some of his lost material--but without a serious black error the game is lost.  } 19. Qxh8+ Kd7 20. Qxh6 Qf6 21. Qxf6 {Probably should have avoided the exchange with Qh3+, and follow that up with exd5.  White's queen would be badly placed, but some of the lost material would be recovered.  Pawn structure would also be weak with doubled d-pawns facing a connected phalanx of queen-side pawns.  } Nxf6 22. Rd2 c5 23. d4 Kc6 24. d5+ Kb6 25. g3 a5 26. Rb2 b4 27. h3 Kb5 28. Kf2 Ka4 29. Ke3 Ka3 30. Rd2 b3 31. axb3 Kxb3 32. Rd3+ Kc4 33. h4 a4 34. Kd2 a3 35. Rc3+ Kb4 36. Rc1 a2 37. Ra1 Kb3 {After 38.Kc1 Ka6 white's king and rook are hamstrung.  Black can move the rook and knight into action to wipe up white's pawns and end the game.  }
