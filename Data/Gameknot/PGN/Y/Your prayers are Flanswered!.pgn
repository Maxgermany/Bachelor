[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Andreaschek gambit"]

1. e4 {I went on a kick where I tried opening 1. c4 for awhile, and that was a disaster.  Back to 1. e4 to me for awhile!} c5 {The Sicilian.  A lot of people here play the Sicilian or respond 1. ...e5.  And a number of people who prefer queen's pawn games play 1. ...d5.  Why don't people play the Caro-Kann, Pirc, or French here much?} 2. d4 {d4 is a funny move order here; typical is Nf3.  But I like to play this way for a specific reason.} cxd4 3. Nf3 {3. c3 would go into the Smith-Morra Gambit, which is interesting for both sides.  But I like 3. Nf3 because it gives me the option, if black tries to hold the pawn with 3...e5, I can then play 4. c3!, which IMO is a stronger position for white after the extra 3. Nf3 e5.  If black plays anything else standard (like e6, d6, g6, or Nc6), 4. Nxd4 and we're back to where we would've been after the normal move order.} e6 {More typical is d6, which leads to dragon/najdorf lines, but e6 leads to paulsen lines.} 4. Nxd4 {And we have transposed to the Paulsen variation.} a6 {?!  But this is a little unusual.  Sure, it's playable, but this usually comes in concert with d6, not e6.  The difference?  After d6, black has the option of bringing his light-squared bishop over to the kingside.  e6 forces the bishop to remain on the queenside for awhile.} 5. Nc3 {Standard development; but this will be useful in nearly any line.} d6 {Interesting; black is eschewing aggressive development by playing d6 before moving the bishop out.  One point of playing either d6 or e6 is to let one of the bishops out.  By playing them together, black is committing himself to develop his bishops to the 7th rank.  This is fine, and I realize this is the point behind Schveningen setups, but I'll take white's position any day.} 6. Be3 {The knight on d4 doesn't really need another defender, but e3 is a good square for this bishop, pointing at both sides of the board without blocking the f-pawn or the queen.} Bd7 {Again, interesting.  Part of the reason for not playing Bc4 on the last move is that black can play b5, tempoing the bishop and giving him the option of Bb7.  Committing to Bd7 this early, before developing the knights, really reveals a lot to me about black's plans.  It basically says that all of black's offensive activity is going to be on the queenside.  } 7. Qd2 {But look at my pieces; they're in the center, and well-positioned.  It means that if I go after black's kingside, especially if he continues to neglect it, my attack will get there first.  This move also allows for 0-0-0, avoids committing to a square for the light-squared bishop, and declares that white is going after a setup like the Yugoslav in the Dragon variation.  White's plan there is something like Qd2, f3, followed by either 0-0-0 or Bc4.} Nc6 {Not a bad move at all, but again, black's kingside is in hibernation after 7 moves.} 8. O-O-O {Coming out swinging!  In hindsight, this isn't the most sound move, as there's no need to declare white's intentions this loudly.  But I didn't want to choose a square for the bishop yet, and I wanted to keep the option of f4 instead of f3 open.} Nf6 {Finally, developing a kingside piece.  I know I don't want it there, and I could kick it out with a pawn on g5.  But that pawn will need support.} 9. f3 {f3 looks supportive.  Also continuing with the plan of a yugoslav setup.} Qc7 {And even though I'm ahead in development, this move reminds me that there' plenty of counterattacking potential for black, and to be mindful of that!} 10. g4 {Here we go, though!  As I declared back on move 8 that I was going to attack the kingside, a pawn storm seems like the most logical way to do it.} h6 {Perhaps this is a good idea, but it makes white's next move obvious.} 11. h4 {!  This not only negates black's last move, it basically solves white's problem of where to move his light squared bishop.  Why?  Because white wants to play g5, but needs to have the rooks connected first, so that he isn't afraid of hxg5.} Be7 {One move away from completing development.  What's he going to do?} 12. Bd3 {Like I said, attacking the kingside is obvious, and this square covers the best light squares on the g- and h-files.} Rc8 {?  Okay, I didn't like this move at all for black when he played it.  I thought that 0-0-0 was the best chance, getting the king to safety with good counterpunching chances.  This takes away the option of tucking the king away on the queenside, forcing the black king to stay in the line of fire.} 13. g5 {Here it comes, cracking the kingside open!} Nxd4 {Exchanging white's powerful knight.} 14. Bxd4 {Where it's replaced by white's powerful bishop.  The queen and two bishops control an incredible amount of space.  White's rooks are connected and ready to leap down the open h-file.  I'm really happy with my chances at this point.} hxg5 {This is a tough situation for black.  I was expecting e5 here, kicking the bishop away.} 15. hxg5 {The knight must be saved.} Nh5 {Again, e5 was better.  Black conceivably overlooked white's next move.} 16. Bxg7 {!  Obvious but neat!  Black goes down on material by a pawn.} Rg8 17. Rxh5 {I'm happy to swap because this will give me doubled rooks on the open h-file.} Rxg7 18. Rh8+ {I'm such a stinker for in-between moves.  This one forces Bf8, "undeveloping" the bishop.  Also, this will remove the threat on the g5 pawn.} Bf8 {Forced.} 19. Rdh1 {Whites rooks are now very powerful.} Bc6 {Realizing that he needs room, and some type of counterattack, black tries to create some activity for himself.} 20. Qf4 {Looking to bring in the kitchen sink, perhaps?} Qe7 {Well, look at this!  Threatening to even material up by taking on g5.} 21. Qf6 {Offering an exchange that will tempo the rook.} Kd7 {Deciding to not leave the c8 rook unprotected?  This move never does much.} 22. f4 {This covers the g5 square and gains a little more space.  Black already is down on material and getting crunched.} Rg6 {Forcing me to take his queen, but who does that really benefit?} 23. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {Interesting.  I also considered that he might play Bxe7.  In either case, do you see how both of our bishops are lined up with enemy rooks, blocked only by the e4 pawn?} 24. Rh1h7 {I decide if I fix this for myself, I can play e5, and try to trap his rook.} e5 {Prevents me from playing e5, but allows the knight to invade.} 25. Nd5+ {!  A good but obvious move!  Now, black's king is being told to run, losing him the f7 pawn.  (Because if Ke8, 26. Rxf8 Kxf8 27. Rh8  Rg8 28. Nf6 !)} Bxd5 {Oops.  This is devastating for black.  White now has exd5, and black's rook is trapped!  The only option that doesn't result in immediate capture, Rg7, fails to 26. Rxg7 Bxg7 27. Rxc8, and black is down a rook in the endgame.  Black resigns, and I have the privilege of taking down an 1800  player, something I haven't done in awhile!  Thanks for the game, and comments, as always, are welcome!}
