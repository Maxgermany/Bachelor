[Opening "Benoni defence (A56)"]

1. d4 {Finally someone played 1. d4 against me. Was getting a bit tired ot Alehkine's defense.} Nf6 {I always play 1... Nf6, no matter what.} 2. c4 {So many options here. e6 leads to the queen's indian, g6 to the king's indian. d5 to some variation of the queen's gambit.} c5 {Let's try something a little offbeat, the Benoni. I actually had in mind the Benko, with 3. d5 b5, but white spoiled that with....} 3. dxc5 {I couldn't find any examples of white accepting the c pawn in recent grandmaster games. I wonder why?} e6 4. Nc3 Bxc5 5. Bg5 Qb6 {Threatening Bxf2  or Qxb2. I know that taking the b pawn in the opening is almost always a bad idea. I know this, and yet...} 6. e3 Qxb2 {Oh well. A queen trade is forced.} 7. Bxf6 gxf6 {Qxc3 ?? Bxc3.} 8. Nge2 Bb4 {This forces a queen trade.} 9. Qc1 Qxc1+ 10. Rxc1 Na6 {Here's where the whole thing comes together. White has no target to punish for gobbling up the b pawn. This knight heads for c5, threatening Nd3 .} 11. g3 Nc5 12. Nf4 {White's forced to defend d3.} Ne4 13. Nfe2 {A gain of 2 tempo!} b5 {I need to neutralize the bishop on g2. Best way of doing so is putting mine on b7, and b5's a little more interesting than b6. White can't afford to capture.} 14. Bg2 Bb7 15. O-O Nxc3 {Setting up play on the queenside. With so few pieces, my soon-to-be passed pawn will be the center around which both sides will play.} 16. Nxc3 {16. Bxb7 Nxe2  17. K<any> Nxc1 18. Bxa8 [18. Rxc1 Rb8] and I'm up a piece.} Bxg2 17. Kxg2 bxc4 {Nabbing the second pawn. It's interesting that the pawn on c4, while passed, can't advance easily. The blockade square c3 is the same color as my bishop, and if the knight settles in on c2 I'm in trouble.} 18. Ne4 {White's knight is a perfect example of the stength a blockading knight has, constantly lashing out from it's post on c3. Black's job here is to tame the knight, to force it to stay on c3. With the knight on c3, black doesn't have to defend his pawn all that hard, since the knight blocks the pawn from frontal assault.} Be7 {The strategy of taming a wild knight is to take away the squares it can use. Here, the knight threatens f6. Bringing the bishop home defends not only the pawn, but the f6 square itself. } 19. Rfd1 {Of course not Rxc4 because of d5 forking the rook and knight.} d5 {And now we return you to your reguarly scheduled square.} 20. Nc3 O-O-O {White's going to play e4, and by castling long I can take advantage of this advance.} 21. e4 dxe4 22. Rxd8+ Rxd8 {More pieces off the board (my intention). Now it's just rook vs rook and the stalion vs the stodgy bishop. The pawn on e4 is of no importance.} 23. Nxe4 Rd4 {But the knight has to be imprisoned on c3.} 24. Nc3 {White must be sick of playing Nc3 by now.} Kd7 {This move keeps with the principle of eliminating effective squares for the knight. Now Nxa7 won't give check. The c7 square isn't safe for the king because of Nb5 giving check.} 25. Nb5 {White continues to lash out with the knight.} Rd5 {And black continues to slowly tame him. Nxa7 is now impossible due to Ra5 trapping the knight. Notice how this wouldn't be possible if Nxa7 gave check.} 26. a4 {Oh, yeah, the rook move threatened the knight. I can't let it get too secure there, since my c pawn is en prise.} a6 {Back! Back to c3!} 27. Nc3 {That's better. The knight's an effective blockader, but his range is slowly being reduced.} Rc5 {An in-between move, inviting Ne4. The idea is to keep white from doing anything productive. 28. Ne4 Rc6 and white doesn't have anything useful to do. He can play g4 or h4 or f4 or whatever, but f5 would eventually force the knight back to c3.} 28. f4 f5 {I was going to play f5 anyhow, to take control of the e4 square and post the bishop on f6.} 29. Rb1 {Whoa! can't have this. Let's get the rook back where it belongs...} Bf6 30. Rc1 {That's better.  The white knight is utterly passive now, as is the rook.} Ra5 {And white, reduced to absolute passivity, resigns. All continuations end badly for white, since Bxc3 Rxc3 Rxa4 creates two passed pawns, with another one on the kingside in reserve. }
