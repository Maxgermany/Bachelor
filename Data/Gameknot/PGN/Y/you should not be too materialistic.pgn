1. d4 {I played my usual d4} b6 {not sure what this line is called} 2. e4 Bb7 3. Bd3 d5 4. e5 {i decided to push my pawn to gain space, and i didnt want to play f3, because after 4... dxe4 5.fxe4 qxd3} e6 {He decides to close the center} 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Nc3 Bb4 7. Bd2 {this maybe was a bit passive move, but i wanted to avoid any damage to my pawn structure on the queen side, since I'm planning on castling there} Bxc3 {He voluntarily gives up his dsb} 8. Bxc3 Qd7 9. Qe2 O-O-O 10. O-O-O Nge7 {Now both sides have finished development and the middle game is about to start} 11. Bb5 {i thought this was a nice pin. Its hard to get rid of since a6 loses a pawn} f6 12. Kb1 {A waiting move to see what black has planned} Kb8 13. Rhe1 Qc8 {this was a nice move actually, but im not sure was it the best move. White is still going to win a pawn.} 14. exf6 gxf6 15. Qxe6 Rd6 16. Qxc8+ {Perhaps i shouldn't have taken, but i felt my pieces were more active and that i would have a winning endgame} Bxc8 17. Re2 {preparing to double rooks} Ng6 {This is where i started to go downhill. This move threatens a for on f4 is white dares to double the rooks.} 18. Bd2 {This move was not good, but i didnt want to leave my knight hanging w g3} Bg4 {ouch} 19. Rde1 Bxf3 20. gxf3 Nxd4 {black wins his pawn back and all of whites pieces are not coordinated} 21. Re2e8+ Rxe8 22. Rxe8+ Kb7 23. Bf1 {black wins a pawn here, but the loss of the pawn helps white to gain an improved position} Nxf3 24. Bb4 Rd7 {if 24... rc6 the rook will be trapped after 25.bb5} 25. Bb5 c6 {This move turned out to be a mistake in the long run, since it cuts off the king later.} 26. Bf1 {saccing/losing another pawn, but white still has a couple of tricks up his sleeve} Nxh2 27. Bh3 Rg7 28. Bd6 {Here black actually should have played ka6. The only move to save the game} Ne5 {And he doesn't! This allows a nice mate to be delivered} 29. Bc8+ {Here black resigns. Because after 29...ka8 30.Ba6#}
