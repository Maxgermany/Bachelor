1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5 {The Latvian Gambit} 3. exf5 e4 4. Nd4 Qf6 5. Qh5+ g6 6. fxg6 hxg6 7. Qd5 Ne7 8. Qxe4 Rh4 {ionadowman:  Already Black has a distinct edge} 9. g4 d5 10. Qd3 Rxg4 {Ionadowman:  Possibly Black can improve by 10...Bxg4, with the view to developing the b8-knight to follow e.g. 10...Bxg4 11.c3 Nbd7 (11...c5 might not be a bad idea, neither).  } 11. c3 Nbc6 12. Be2 Ne5 13. Qe3 Re4 14. Qg3 Bg4 15. f4 Bxe2 {ionadowman:  To be honest, this "looks" wrong to me, though Black retains the edge. My first thought was 15...Nf5!? 16.fxe5 Qg5 17.h4 Qh5 (-/ ) with a sizeable advantage. But a second look comes up with 15...Qa6! instead (16.0-0 Bxe2) and Black seems to have a winning game.  } 16. Nxe2 Nf7 17. d3 Re6 {ionadowman:  Black still had plenty of attack based on 16...Qa6 or 16...Nf5. e.g. [A] 16...Qa6 17.c4! Nf5 18.Qg2 Nd3  or [B] 16...Nf5 17.fxe5 Rxe2! 18.Kd1! Rxe5 (=/ )  } 18. Qg4 {ionadowman:  Evans could have pulled the game around to very nearly level terms with 18.Qf2. After the text move, Black keeps an attack.  } Nf5 19. O-O O-O-O 20. Ng3 Kb8 21. a4 {Here Evans offered a draw.  ionadowman:   A couple of American writers offered the view that Grivainis ought to have accepted Evans's draw offer. But I don't think Larry Evans was being generous here. Black still has the advantage. He was right to go for the win if he could.  } Bd6 {ionadowman:  looks plausible, but maybe there was something to be said for doubling rooks on the e-file? Over the next half-dozen moves, the game becomes murkily balanced...  } 22. Na3 Rh8 23. Nb5 Rh4 24. Qf3 Nf7h6 25. Nxd6 cxd6 26. Bd2 Ng4 27. Rfe1 Nxh2 {ionadowman:  After this, the game takes a definite turn in White's favour, though Grivainis isn't out of it by any means. But here, with 27...Rxh2! Black could just about have obliged White to take the draw. If 27...Rxh2 28.Nf1?? then 28...Qh4! 29.Rxe6 Rh1 ! 30.Kg2 Rxf1! 31.Kxf1 Nh2  32.Ke2 Nxf3 33.Kxf3 Qh3  (-/ ). Instead, 27...Rxh2 28.Qxg4 Rxd2 29.Nxf5 (29.Rxe6 Qxe6) 29...Qxf5 (=). } 28. Qxd5 Rxe1+ 29. Rxe1 Rh8 30. Nxf5 gxf5 31. Re2 Qh6 {?? ionadowman:  After 31...Qg6  Black retains very realistic drawing chances! That Grivainis played the Q back to g6 the next move suggests to me ha recognised at once his mistake} 32. Re7 Qg6+ 33. Kf2 {}
