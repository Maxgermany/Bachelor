1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 {I think f6 here weakened his king. Not disastrously perhaps, but I would have automatically tried to take advantage with 3.d4 trying to open the center and get my queen mobilized as soon as possible.    } 3. Bc4 Nh6 {d4 is even more tempting here. The opportunity to capture his knight with my c1 bishop and weaken his pawn structure and king side further is too tempting.    } 4. O-O c6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Re1 {Why not d4 or d3 to get the bishop out. Also, I know the books say that moving a piece more than once during the opening is a sin, so I would not have recommended Re1.   } b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. d4 Nd7 {Is there a line here? 9. Bxh6 gxh6 10.Ng5. Black cannot take as it is mate after 11. Qh5  and then Qf7#. After black makes his 10th move, he cannot prevent an entrenched knight in his backyard.  } 9. d5 {Are you aiming for a closed position here. I think capturing on e5 (or h6) would have been better for an open game. But this is a matter of preference. I like closed positions as much as open ones - so long as I have good knights and plenty of space.    } c5 10. a4 b4 11. Na2 a5 12. Nh4 Nf7 13. c3 Rb8 14. cxb4 cxb4 15. Qf3 {I would have developed the c1 bishop and taken the open C file with a rook.    } g5 {He's actually weakening his king side further. It shouldn't be too difficult to take advantage with g3 and then f4. And perhaps a Queen on h5 and the knight on f5. He'll especially be in trouble if his pawn on d6 captures on e5 or c5 for some reason. In short, if white can get a bit ahead in development and bring her knight on a2 back into action, perhaps a rook on c6 black will be in a lot of trouble. Watch out for Nc5 though.  I don't see the sequence of moves that make all these possible both in a closed position like this all you can do is improve your position in small bits until something pays off.    } 16. Nf5 Nc5 17. Bc4 Bxf5 18. Qxf5 Nxa4 19. b3 Nc5 20. Qh3 {Queen to the corner? It seemed fine where it was.  } h5 21. Qf5 Qe7 22. Be3 Nd7 23. Nc1 Ra8 24. Nd3 h4 25. Nxb4 {Beautiful move.  } Qd8 26. Nc6 Qc7 27. Qe6+ {Mate in 1 Black Resigns }
