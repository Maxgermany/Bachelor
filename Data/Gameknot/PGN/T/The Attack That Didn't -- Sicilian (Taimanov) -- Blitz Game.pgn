[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 2. f4 {This is the initiation of the Grand Prix Attack, a nasty little piece of work that's given me trouble over the years - at least until I figured out that Taimanov's system defends against it quite well in all cases, and sometimes by transposing the opening into a variation of the French Defense, in which my buddy Al has kept me in sharp practice with for more than 20 years as he plays the French almost exclusively against 1. e4.} Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Bb5 Qc7 5. d3 Nge7 6. O-O {This move is certainly playable; but as I recall, the text departs from the pawnstorming strategy of the Grand Prix, which is to castle long and begin a direct, often sacrificial attack against Black's castled King.} a6 7. Bxc6 Nxc6 8. Nc3 Be7 9. Be3 b5 10. a3 O-O 11. Qe2 b4 12. axb4 cxb4 13. Na4 Rb8 {Yes, Black is willing to win 2 pieces for the Rook in this position, with a Q-side bind, if White wants to go there.} 14. b3 d6 15. Rad1 {? - Removing a Rook from an already half-opened file to place it on a closed file that has little chance of opening or even half-opening? This is a violation of strategic principles, and must be considered a mistake.} Re8 16. d4 d5 17. e5 {In order to gain space and therefore freedom for an attack on the K-side, White has given up some significant gains that were already in hand, such as control of b6 and the control of the half-open a-file. Will his positional judgment prove correct? In this game, not quite.} Bd7 18. Ng5 f5 {! -- Black holds with counterplay after 19. ef6 Bf6, after which White's own weakness at c2 may begin to be exploited.} 19. Qh5 {?! -- 19. g4 seems a more logical way to start prying Black's shell open. The text just compels Black to trade his DSB for the Knight which is not a bad thing in light of the fact that Black knows he needs to clear his second rank.} Bxg5 20. fxg5 g6 {Now Black's wall around the King is very nearly impregnable, and White's Bishop has become little more than an overgrown pawn.} 21. Qh4 Na7 22. Nc5 Bb5 23. Rf3 {All seen. The weakness in the attack White wants to build against h7 is that he's leading with his Queen, and Black can make the first capture there with a Rook. ... Stop the presses: The two kibitzers are correct, and I missed the move in the game and in the analysis: 23. ...Be2 is a killer.} Re7 24. Rh3 Rbe8 {! -- Black overprotects e6, allowing the e7R freedom to move as need be, for example to g7, followed by lifting the e8R to e7, making h7 untouchable by White.} 25. Rd2 {A waiting move? This is no position for White to be making waiting moves. Still, it's difficult to suggest anything better. Black will snap off the Knight immediately if White plays it to d3 with the idea of ...Nf4, while 25. g4 is met with ...Rf7.} Nc6 {! -- White probably doesn't realize it yet, but Black's Knight is heading for b7, to get rid of the pest at c5.} 26. Rf2 Nd8 27. g4 Nb7 {! -- Black's defense stays one tempo ahead of White's attack} 28. gxf5 exf5 29. Nd3 Bxd3 30. cxd3 Nd8 {Its mission accomplished, the Knight races for the blockading square at e6. White's attack has been completely stymied, and now he finds he needs to reorganize his postion completely, for defense, because Black is already positioned to begin an attack of his own.} 31. Bf4 Ne6 32. Be3 Qc3 33. Ra2 Qxb3 34. Rxa6 Qd1+ 35. Kf2 {Now how does Black defend against the threat of 36. Re6? Well, 35. ...Qg4 is one way. But a more elegant and forceful way is ...} Rb7 {!! -- Now Black holds everything AND supports the advance of the deadly b-pawn.} 36. Rg3 b3 37. Rg1 Qc2+ 38. Kf3 b2 {And White resigns. After 39. Qf2 Qf2  40. Bf2 b1=Q it's over.}
