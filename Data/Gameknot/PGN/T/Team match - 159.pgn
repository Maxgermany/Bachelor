1. g3 {Benko's Opening.  The leading responses (d5, e5, Nf6, g6, & c5) all tend to be pretty good for black. } c5 2. Bg2 {The database favors Nc6 as a response.} e5 3. e3 {Not in the database.} Nf6 4. f4 exf4 5. exf4 d6 6. b3 Bg4 7. Bf3 Bh5 {Uh, retreat is a bad idea here because BxB, NxB, QxN and white comes out ahead in this exchange 3 points.  BxBf3 would have been better.  QxB, Nc6 (to prevent QxPb7).} 8. Bxh5 Nxh5 9. Qxh5 Be7 10. Bb2 O-O 11. Qg4 {Here white is setting up for QxPg7#.  Black should respond with Bf6 or possibly Pg6.} Nc6 {Nc6 was not the answer.} 12. Qxg7# {}
