1. e4 c5 2. d4 {not so popular gambit. it opens the center quickly but it leeds to a wild game with chances on both sides.} cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 d6 6. Bc4 {white gained an open space, a solid center and a quick piece developement. will it last?} a6 7. O-O Nf6 8. Qe2 {wants Rd1 and e5.} g6 9. Rd1 Bg4 {does black see the threat? I don't think so. Bf4 and e5 are very powerful for white.} 10. Bf4 Nd7 11. Rac1 {? misses the tactical blow. 11. Bxf7! with Ng5  later on.} Nce5 12. Bxe5 Bxf3 13. Bxf7+ {of course. demolishes all defence around the king...} Kxf7 14. Qxf3+ Nf6 15. Bxf6 exf6 16. e5 {! both f6 and d6 are in danger.} Rb8 17. exd6 Bh6 18. Rc2 Re8 19. Ne4 {wants Rc7.} Bg7 20. Rc7+ Kf8 21. Qb3 Qxc7 {it seems like the only move to prevent Qf7#.} 22. dxc7 Rbc8 23. Qxb7 {the end!}
