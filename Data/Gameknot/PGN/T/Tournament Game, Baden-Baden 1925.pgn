[White "Savielly Tartakower "]
[Black "Jacques Mieses "]
[Opening "Dutch (A82), Staunton gambit, Tartakower variation"]

1. d4 f5 2. e4 {Tartakower plays aggressively, using the From Gambit.} fxe4 {The gambit must be accepted. However, this opens an avenue of attack for Tartakower along the KB file.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. g4 {The usual move is 4 B-KN5, but Tartakower springs a novelty. Mieses misses the best response [4... P-KR3]. Alekhine used the "opening surprise" method throughout his career to great success, so Tartakower borrows a page from his playbook.} d5 5. g5 {Forcing the Knight back to its original square.} Ng8 6. f3 {Practically forcing Mieses' reply, as 6... B-B4 7 PxP PxP 8 B-QB4 is virtually a won game for White.} exf3 7. Qxf3 {Applying pressure along the open KB file. With ...N-KB3 impossible, Mieses has no effective way to block an invasion along this route.} e6 8. Bd3 g6 {To prevent 9 Q-R5 ch.} 9. Nge2 {Clearing the Rook's path to KB1, augmenting the attack.} Qe7 {Black has to defend the natural invasion spot at his KB2.} 10. Bf4 {Throwing another piece forward. White's lead in development is immense.} c6 {To close off B-N5 ch.} 11. Be5 {Attacking the immobilized KR.} Bg7 {Forced.} 12. Qg3 {Now threatening to win the QN. White's superior mobility and ability to attack the whole board are causing Black's defenses to crumble.} Na6 {12... N-Q2 would at least threaten to exchange a pair of minor pieces. Black's position is hopeless in any case.} 13. O-O {Bringing yet another piece into the attack.} Bd7 {Black desperately tries to stem the oncoming tidal wave.} 14. Bd6 {Forcing away the Queen.} Qd8 {The only square.} 15. Qf4 {Mieses resigns. White's two mating threats [16 Q-B7 mate and 16 Q-B8 ch! BxQ 17 RxB mate] cannot be parried without ruinous loss of material.}
