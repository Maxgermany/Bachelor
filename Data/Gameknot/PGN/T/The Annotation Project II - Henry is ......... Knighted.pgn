1. f4 {Hi everyone!  Another game with the Master Mater and another game where Jo gets Freddied.  Henry gets the dubious honour of being "Knighted" at the end.  How does this happen, well, read on.  We pick up the action on move 8.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Ke8 {8...... Ke8 - Freddy puts his king back on its home square.} 9. Bf7+ Kd7 10. Be6+ Kc6 {10. ...... Kc6 - avoiding draw by repitition and I have nothing better than to whip off the g4 knight.} 11. Bxg4 Bg7 {11. ...... Bg7! - this gives me food for thought.  That dsb rakes down on to my queenside.  If I play Nc3 then BxN breaks up my pawns.  In hindsight though maybe it would have been better to have allowed that trade for although it may have broken up my pawns it may have opened up some lines onto the exposed black king.  I now trade my developed knight for that dsb.  Freddy said it was a mistake and so it proved.  Fou Lenoir stays at home the entire game!} 12. Ne6 Qg8 13. Nxg7 Qxg7 14. Nc3 {14. Nc3 - this is as far as I get with developing my queenside.} Na6 15. a3 {15. a3 - preventing Nb4.} Qd4 16. Ne2 {16. Ne2 - trying to chase away the Witch.  She does back off and allow me to castle but is that an invitation to castle into it?} Qd6 17. O-O h5 {17. ...... h5 - pawn push.} 18. Bh3 Rhf8 19. g3 g5 20. Bg2 gxf4 21. Bxe4+ {21. Bxe4+ - over the next two moves I close the deficit to two material points but Freddy's attack moves up a gear or two.} Kd7 22. Rxf4 Rxf4 23. gxf4 Nc5 {23. ..... Nc5 - onward charges that rampant horsie.} 24. Bf3 Qg6+ {24. ....... Qg6+ - nasty queen fork, grabs the c2 pawn and worse still she invades my castle to try and sieze Henry.} 25. Kf2 Qxc2 26. Bxh5 {26. Bxh5 - I do a little pawn grabbing of my own but it doesn't help.} Qe4 27. Bg4+ e6 28. h3 {28. h3 - in hindsight I think d4 was better, at least it would have freed up a diagonal for Fou Lenoir.} Nd3+ 29. Kg1 Rg8 {29. ...... Rg8 - pinning Fou Leblanc.} 30. Nc3 {30. Nc3 - allows mate in two but not sure what I could do.  Freddy moves the Witch to f3 and I beg Freddy for Henry to be allowed to stay in the hospitality suite of his castle instead of the horrid fetid draughty dungeons as I feel he has clocked up enough Tesco loyalty vouchers with such frequent visits to go there.  Freddy replied that he would grant me the vouchers plus a free ticket to a Fancy Mate!  Haha!} Qf3 31. b4 {31. b4 - I decide to spend this token move to show where I would have liked to have put Fou Lenoir.} Qg3+ 32. Kh1 Rxg4 {32. ..... Rxg4 - Freddy decided to given Henry a Stay of Execution for just one move but after I taken off the bishop he does knight Henry and then Henry is taken away to Freddy's castle to spend yet another night or two in Freddy's there - this time it is the luxury suite - away from his beloved Glenda.  Ah well, I hope he fares better in Freddy's Traxler Tournament that I plan to enter once I get my games load down.} 33. hxg4 Nf2# {}
