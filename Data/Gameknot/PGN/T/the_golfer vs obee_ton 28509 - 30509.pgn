1. e4 {This is my first annotation of a chess match. This match shows that even if you are winning and about to checkmate, everything can turn around last minute. The final checkmate was pretty obvious, but I was quite oblivious. I always like to open with the king's pawn advancing two spaces} b6 {This move appears commonly, but I don't really understand the purpose of it.} 2. Qf3 {Opening with a queen is not always a smart idea, but if the opponent is not careful, checkmate can be easy.} g6 {Another strange move I wasn't really sure about. The opponent must have been planning something.} 3. Bc4 {Now if the opponent makes a silly move, the game is over.} e6 {However, this is not the case. The pawn blocks the bishop's attack, so I have to come up with another plan.} 4. d4 {Releasing that pawn opens up my black square bishop.} Nf6 {That knight gets in my way, so I really need to change tactics.} 5. e5 {I attack the knight with my pawn, hoping for it to go away.} Nh5 {It does. But what is he planning now?} 6. d5 {Didn't really pay attention to it. My other pawn attack's my opponent's king pawn.} Bb7 {The bishop lines up an attack. I guess I can't take that pawn after all.} 7. g4 {So I decide to attack the knight. He is getting pretty close and I'm beginning to get cautious.} Ng7 {He finally retreats. I feel safer.} 8. h4 {So I move my pawn up so it reduces the chance of my opponent wanting to move his knight back, not that he would want to anyway.} Bxd5 {The first piece of the game is taken. It was my queen pawn.} 9. Bxd5 {I take his bishop, but I won't stay ahead for long.} exd5 {Of course, he would take me back.} 10. Qxd5 {So I take him, opening the attack on his rook.} c6 {He blocks me with a pawn forcing me to retreat.} 11. Qb3 {I return to my pawns where I am safe.} Bc5 {His bishop comes to attack me.} 12. Bh6 {So I attack him.} Ne6 {The knight comes back into play. We are still tied in points, because we are both playing defensively.} 13. Nf3 {I go to protect two pawns with my knight.} Nd4 {He attacks my knight and queen. I don't really have a choice now.} 14. Nxd4 {So I take him.} Bxd4 {Back to square points. He is now attacking my pawn, so I should defend it.} 15. Bg5 {I don't, but I attack his queen.} f6 {Blocks me with a pawn.} 16. Bxf6 {I take him. I am now ahead.} Qc7 {He moves his queen, so I am free to take his rook.} 17. Bxh8 Bxe5 {He takes my pawn, but I am still five points up. Not that really mattered in the outcome of the finale.} 18. Bxe5 {So I take him, waiting for him to take me.} Qxe5+ {I am now in check. I always find it disadvantageous to move your king out of check, so I prefer to block with the piece worth the least amount of points.} 19. Qe3 {My queen was my only choice if I wanted to play the way I usually play.} Qxe3+ {He takes me, so I should really take him.} 20. fxe3 {The game becomes more interesting now both of the queens have been taken.} Kf7 {He moves his king.} 21. Rf1+ {I instantly put him into check. It's just what I like to do.} Kg7 {He has nothing to block with, so he moves, but he is starting to corner himself.} 22. h5 {I move in on the attack. I have a piece advantage which I can hopefully use later.} g5 {He moves so I can't take him. Probably a good idea at this stage.} 23. e4 {I try and promote my pawns to give me a bigger advantage.} c5 {He opens up his knight which will play a key role later to force checkmate. He was probably already planning the finish at this point.} 24. e5 {I keep going.} Nc6 {The knight has now come out. The game is about to take a turn.} 25. Rf5 {I go to protect my own pawn and go attack his.} h6 {Of course, he defends.} 26. Nc3 {I bring my knight out. I was going to use my knight to force checkmate.} Re8 {His rook comes out to attack my pawn.} 27. O-O-O {I castle queen side, attacking the pawn on d7. This later proved to be a bad decision.} Re7 {obee_ton goes to defend his pawn with his rook. Smart idea.} 28. Nd5 {I attack his rook, hoping for obee_ton to lower the attack on my pawn.} Rxe5 {He takes it anyway and is now defended by his knight. I am still four points up as the number of pieces becomes less and less.} 29. Nc7 {I move my knight away to move into a more attacking position.} Re7 {obee_ton now sensing that checkmate could be coming decides to not lose any more pieces.} 30. Rd6 {I am eager to attack moving my castling rook up.} a5 {He is attacking from the side. Not much point really.} 31. Rg6+ {So I go put the king in check. I am becoming very close to ending the game... and so is obee_ton.} Kh7 {He puts his king on h7. Playing defensive and attacking at the same time.} 32. Rf8 {The game is nearly over and I place my rook on f8.} Ne5 {This is where obee_ton starts the checkmate plan. The knight moves to e5 and he is about to trap me. I never suspected. To create a diversion, obee_ton made it look like he was actually attacking my rook. Very smart play.} 33. Rgg8 {I in defence, move my rook away and closer to checkmate.} Nc4 {The knight is coming in for the final blow. I didn't even see this coming, as I was too focused checkmating myself.} 34. Nd5 {My knight was now in place for checkmate.} Re1# {At the last minute, obee_ton checkmated me. This showed me how much being ahead in points isn't always the best thing. You should always be checking what your opponent is going to do next. Thank you for watching this annotation. I have to admit it wasn't very good, but that's what you get reading a thirteen year old's play! Congratulations to obee_ton for such a great game and a great lesson!}
