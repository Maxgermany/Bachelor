1. d4 {I have to admit it... I knew I was up against an opponent who plays 200 pts above me. Going in I researched some of his games. He's a very clever and solid player; my work was cut out.... so I started with my strength.  The French  against his Queen Pawn ..... } e6 2. e4 d5 3. e5 {White plays the advanced variation. complicating Blacks development.} c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Nge7 6.

Bxf5 exf5 {A trade encouraged by Black to open up the closed game and eliminate the strong white Bishop.} 8. O-O cxd4 9. cxd4 Be6 {White is positionally stronger than Black who's Bishop is relegated to pawn defense. Black however finds a way to shift gears soon.} 10. Nc3 Be7 11. Qb3 Qd7 12. Bd2 h6 13. Rac1 {White appears to be very strong and stable...} g5 {Pow! A nose punch. Time to wake-up. Black becomes very aggressive going after White's king side before White can take advantage of his superior development. Timing and speed become critical in this bout.} 14. Ne2 f4 15.

Black give a pawn to open up Whites belly with a kidney punch} Bh3 22. Nxd5 {A  full round house counter by White. Taking the poison rook would end the game for Black in short order. } Be6 {The second pawn sacrifice now becomes clear as Black's bishop locks the white queen into the corner ropes. } 23. Nxf6+ Rxf6 24. Qd1 {Trying to free the queen.....} Rxf3 {but the body blows just push her into another corner that she cannot get out of.} 25. Ng3 Bd5 {A huge uppercut with the Bishop now on the winning diagonal has white shaky in the knees and unable to budge. He is defenseless and just  waiting  for the.......} 26. hxg5 {and here it comes....  the knockout blow....} Qh3 {White can do nothing. Black plans Nexg3  and mate in two.  I enjoyed this game and hope any readers do as well.  Comments are welcome as I'm not sure how much of this game was strong play by black as opposed to weak moves by white. Thank you}
