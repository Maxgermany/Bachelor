1. d4 {This game is from a thematic mini tournament I am currently playing in, it begins with a queens gambit. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 it's for people with ratings from 1500-2050 and I am already very glad I entered. Especially as I have already managed a couple of good results like a win against a 2011 rated player (incidentally another Benko gambit won me that game) and now a second win against someone rated over 1700.} Nf6 2. c4 c5 {Going for my usual Benko gambit.} 3. d5 b5 4. Nf3 g6 {Since white has not pushed his e pawn yet figured I would simply continue developing. I wonder though if playing d6 would have been a better idea just incase white had tried to shake things up by playing d6 himself.} 5. cxb5 {So now white is going to accept the gambit after all.} a6 6. Nc3 axb5 7. Nxb5 {If white was going to do this he may as well have taken on a6 as it leads to the same thing anyway.} Ba6 8. Nc3 {So now we have a regular Benko gambit.} d6 9. e4 Bxf1 {Normal Benko gambit strategy.} 10. Kxf1 Nbd7 11. g3 Bg7 12. Kg2 O-O 13. Re1 {Now we are probably still in book but this is as far as my actual 'book' knowledge takes me. Not that it really matters. Blacks ideas are seem to reveal themselves for this opening and very little theory knowledge is needed to play black in the benko gambit. A general idea of blacks usual plans is sufficient.} Qb6 {I find I often bring my queen to b6 however in the Benko gambit in can just as often end up on a5. either way the point is to pressure whites queen side by having a rook on the a & b files and often supported by the queen.} 14. Qc2 Rfb8 15. b3 {This just creates weaknessess in whites position. So far blacks position only really has a weakness on e7. } Ng4 {Aiming for e5. When I made this move I hoped for an intersting variation. I began spending alot of time calculating 16.h3 Ne5 17.Nxe5 Nxe5 18.f4 then the spectacular sacrafice 18...c4!? Of course after making the move I realised that I had spent all my time considering this unlikely variation and not put any thought into what would happen if white did anything else. A rather silly thing to do on my part. } 16. Bb2 {I had wondered if white might try this. It is at least consiestant with whites play so far however it does allow blacks next move.} c4 {This should win back atleast one pawn for black. though this is not why I made the move.} 17. Na4 {This was expected and is the natural move. Of course there were other options as well.} Rxa4 {Obviously if bxa4 black is better after Qxb2 However I hoped in vain that white might try bxc4?? then I prepared 18...Qxb2 19.Qxa4 Qxf2+ 20.Kh3 Qxf3 and a piece up then if white tried to get the piece back 21.Qxd7?? Nf2+ 22.Kh4 Bf6# of course it is extremely unlikely this would ever have occurred and even if white had not seen this 18.bxc4 is still bad as black could simply retreat the rook. Though it is fun to look at these lines even if they will never happen. } 18. Bxg7 {This is natural, obvious and best. I know that it is usually a bad idea to allow the DSB to be taken off however in this game I felt that black gets compensation in other ways.} cxb3 {This is practically forced.} 19. axb3 {As is this. Any other move would have lost for white.} Rb4 {Black could have immediately regained the pawn with Rxa1 Bxa1 Qxb3. With a sort of dull equality. However I felt it was in blacks best interest to keep material on, besides whites pawn isn't going anywhere and black can take it at anytime. Plus I feel more comfortable with blacks position here. What do you think? would you prefer white or black in this position?} 20. Bc3 {It was either this or Bb2 } Rxb3 {I felt now was the right time to take it. } 21. Bd4 {With the rook no longer covering d4 white is now free to attack my queen. It also prevents black from pinning the bishop. It was about here that I envisioned a sacrifice.} Qb4 {I very nearly made a fatal blunder here, I had began looking deeply into an interesting line, so much in fact that I nearly forgot that my queen was under attack! It wasn't until just as I went to make my move that I realised what I had done. It became a choice of weather to move my queen to b7 to prevent the white queen landing on c7 however this was obvious when I noticed that this keeps my plan alive. } 22. h3 {I had vaguely wondered if white might have tried Qc7?! here. But this move deserves a ?! or possibly even a ? as it makes my next move quite strong. 5 brownie points if you see it.} Rxf3 {I would give this move a (!) except I am worried someone would tell me that it was actually a horrific blunder :P   **** So I shall give it a !? instead. I was very happy to find myself making such a move as this, especially since it didn't actually require any effort to find. It means I must be improving as even a few months back this is the sort of thing I would be unlikely to see instantly. After this whites king becomes dangerously exposed. I spent a long time going over many different variations and found that white was in serious danger of being mated if he was not careful. I figured I would at least have a perpetual check if white accepts.} 23. Kxf3 Qxd4 {Blacks pieces are rather well placed at the moment to take advantage of the poor placement of the white king.} 24. Kxg4 {?? this blunder should have lost the game for white in fact I think it is actually mate in 13 or there abouts unless white can sacrifice the queen. however white is probably lost here anyway as hxg4 runs into the nasty looking Rb2. So maybe whites best chance was to play Rad1 after which black maintains his material advantage and comes away with an obviously better position.} h5+ {!! There are probably a couple of ways to entwine the white king in the mating net however this was the one I came up with.} 25. Kf4 {Kh4 losses to Qf6# Kg5 losses to Qf6+ Kh6 g5+ Kxh5 Qg6+ Kg4 Ne5# Kf3 losses to Ne5+ And after Rb2 white has to give up the queen or be mated. so this move seems to hold out best. However find blacks next move to keep the white king from safety.} g5+ {Yep that's right offering a poisonous pawn to drag the white king back into the mating net. The pawn is immune since if white were to accept then mate would soon follow. 26.Kxg5 Qf6+ 27.Kxh5 Qg6+ 28.Kh4 Qh6+ 29.Kg4 Ne5+ 30.Kf5 Qf6# and of course 26.Kf5 meets Qf6# which leaves whites next as the only option.} 26. Kf3 {Now what happens next still leaves a hollow pit in my stomach. After planning all this out and even plugging in the necessary conditional moves I make the most horrible judgement call. I delete the conditional moves I had set. Of course at this point Rb2!! wins on the spot since it forces white to give up the queen Qc8+ is mate in 11 I believe.However when I was going over my conditional moves to make sure I hadn't gotten confused due to all the variations I thought to myself that there was no reason I couldn't play Ne5+ straight away.  } Ne5+ {Instead of making the instantly winning move I made this blunder! there are at least two reasons Rb2 had to come before this move. 1.Rb2 would mean that I could respond to white playing Ra4 with Qf6+ and more importantly 2.playing Rb2 first would mean my knight was blocking the white queens access to the h3-c8 diagonal after Qc8+. Now black is probably dead lost.} 27. Kg2 Rb2 28. Qc8+ Kg7 29. Qf5 {My heart dropped after this. it was now that I realised what I had done.} Nd3 {I thought this was my best shot at making anything worthwhile happen. I also put some thought into Kh6 and f6 but I came to the conclusion that this allowed more opportunities for white to slip up.} 30. Qxg5+ {I thought that white could do no better than snaffling these two pawns then trading down to a ending where I might have slim drawing chances when suddenly I realised there were ways that white could end my attack and me not get anything out of it. } Kh7 {Then I realised I had overlooked the possibility of the rook coming to e2. If white were to play it now then we would liquidate into a queen pawn ending where I was two pawns down.} 31. Qxh5+ Kg7 32. Qg5+ Kh7 33. Qf5+ Kg7 34. Ref1 {But white went with the more defensive approach.} Nxf2 {! I think this was the best move black could have made in this position. I think whites best bet here might be to accept the queen pawn ending with Rxf2 and hope that one extra pawn would be enough to win.} 35. Rab1 {?? This move stunned me. After I had given the game away in a completely won position white goes and blunders his queen giving me slight winning chances or at the very least a draw.} Ng4+ {My opponent must have overlooked the family fork at e3 when they made their last move. Or else they missed the mate after Kf3.} 36. Kf3 {I guess they missed the mate in two. Can you find it?} Nh2+ 37. Kf4 Qd2# {Overall this was one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played, I was very lucky to win this after I made the wrong move before. This game was a bit of a confidence booster for me as well. As now I can see from this game that I am beginning to find that I can undergo a successful attack and that my tactical skills aren't too bad. Perhaps one day I will be up to a 1700 - 1800 standard after all.}
