1. d4 d6 {Queen's pawn opening.} 2. e4 {Not in the GK database. } Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Bd3 e6 7. O-O Nc6 8. e5 dxe5 9. fxe5 Ne8 10. Ne4 {Oops, there is not enough power on d4 to guard against Nxd4.  Be3 might have been better, especially with the king's castle opened.} Nxd4 11. Nxd4 {This trade won't prevent the loss of Pe5.} Qxd4+ 12. Kh1 Qxe5 13. Ng5 Nd6 14. c3 b6 15. Qc2 Bb7 16. Bf4 Qc5 17. b4 {Oops, that move leaves Pc3 vulnerable to BxPc3.} Qxc3 {That too.  The other way threatened the a rook, while giving black the b pawn.} 18. Qxc3 Bxc3 19. Rac1 Bxb4 20. Rxc7 Bd5 21. Rd7 {Black wants even trades, and the a pawn is vulnerable.  This rook might have been better off at c7.} Rfd8 22. Rc7 a5 23. Bxd6 Bxd6 24. Rcxf7 h6 25. Nh3 e5 26. Bxg6 {?  Why not move the rook?  Like, down to f2 where it could protect Pa2?} Bxf7 27. Bxf7+ Kg7 28. Bd5 Rdf8 29. Rb1 Rab8 30. Nf2 {?  Sacrifice the knight?} Rxf2 31. Rd1 Rbf8 32. g3 Rf2f1+ 33. Rxf1 Rxf1+ 34. Kg2 Rd1 35. Bb3 Rd2+ 36. Kh3 e4 37. Bc4 e3 38. a4 e2 39. Bxe2 Rxe2 40. Kh4 Rxh2+ 41. Kg4 Kf6 42. Kf3 Rh3 43. Ke4 {Kg4 would not prevent RxPg3.  Pa4 remains invisible to black's bishop, so white's only choice now is to promote the pawn.} Rxg3 44. Kd5 Bc5 45. Ke4 {Yes.  The a pawn is stymied.  White also cannot stop black's h pawn promotion, so long as the rook owns the g file.} Ra3 {Personally, I would have ignored that.  It isn't going anywhere.  And the king and rook alone can force mate from here.} 46. Kf4 Rxa4+ 47. Kf3 {White must hold out for a stalemate, which of course cannot be forced.} Rd4 48. Ke2 a4 49. Kf3 a3 50. Ke3 a2 51. Kf3 a1=Q 52. Ke3 Qc3+ {Here the queen/rook combination frog march the white king up against the wall, where the obligatory blindfold and last cigarette are offered.} 53. Ke2 Rd2+ 54. Ke1 Qc1# {}
