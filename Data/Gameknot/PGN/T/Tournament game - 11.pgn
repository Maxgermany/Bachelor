[Black "Julian Perlis (GM)"]
[Opening "French defence, Steiner variation (C00)"]

1. e4 e6 {Perlis intends a French defence...} 2. c4 {...which Niemzowitsch prevents, by not playing 2 P-Q4.} c5 {Perlis counters by advancing his own QBP.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 {Both players develop a Knight.} 4. d4 {Niemzowitsch tries a central thrust.} cxd4 {Perlis promptly captures the Pawn.} 5. Nxd4 {Niemzowitsch completes the exchange, and now has a centralized Knight.} Nf6 {Perlis chooses not to capture, preferring to continue his development.} 6. Nc3 {Both players have now developed their Knights.} Bb4 {Perlis develops with a pin.} 7. Nxc6 {Niemzowitsch initiates an exchange...} bxc6 {...and Perlis completes it.} 8. e5 {Niemzowitsch thrusts...} Ne4 {...and Perlis ripostes.} 9. Qg4 Nxc3 {Perlis's other choice was 9...N-B4, but he chooses the capture.} 10. Bd2 {Rather than the immediate recapture, Niemzowitsch prefers to develop. If the threatened Knight moves, the Bishop is lost, so Niemzowitsch should regain the piece anyway.} Qa5 {Perlis is trying to force Niemzowitsch's hand by guarding the Bishop.} 11. Qxg7 {Niemzowitsch counters with an attack on Perlis's KR.} Rf8 12. a3 {Now the N and B are both attacked by Pawns, and Niemzowitsch will regain the piece... he thinks.} Nd5 {A clever counter. 13 PxN would fail to 13...BxB ch, and 13 PxB would allow 13...QxR ch.} 13. Bxb4 Nxb4 {Niemzowitsch still cannot regain the piece, as 14 PxN allows 14...QxR ch.} 14. O-O-O Na6 {As a result of Niemzowitsch's delay in recapturing the piece, he ends up not recapturing it at all.} 15. f4 {Guarding the advanced Pawn.} Rb8 {Perlis is beginning to press a Queen-side attack.} 16. Qxh7 {Niemzowitsch snags a loose Pawn.} Qb6 {Doubling major pieces on the QN file. Perlis is beginning to generate severe Q-side pressure.} 17. Qc2 {Bringing the Queen back into the ranks for defence.} Qe3+ {Centralizing the Queen with a check.} 18. Qd2 {Offering to exchange Queens, hoping to break the attack.} Qb3 {Smartly rejecting the offer.} 19. Qc2 {Still trying to break the attack.} Nc5 {Now threatening to recapture with check if Niemzowitsch does exchange the Queens.} 20. Bd3 {Bringing another piece over to defend.} Ba6 {Activating his heretofore useless QB.} 21. Qxb3 {Finally exchanging the Queens.} Nxb3+ {The attack has lost some force, but is still strong. Furthermore, Perlis's extra piece should outweigh Niemzowitsch's two extra Pawns in an endgame.} 22. Kc2 {Trying to keep the King out of the corner.} c5 {Locking the QB pawns in place.} 23. Kc3 {Playing out the string.} Ke7 {Centralizing his own King and connecting his Rooks. Niemzowitsch graciously resigns the lost endgame. Well done by Perlis.}
