1. d4 {The Queen game from my opponent, Blitzkov. } Nf6 {I always do nf3 in a Queen Game. } 2. c4 {I can go Nimzo Attack or King's Indian.  It depends upon my mood at the time. Either work. } g6 {I felt at this day and time I needed to do the King's Indian Defense. } 3. Nc3 {Usual for the d4 development. } d5 {Usual line to prevent losing control over the center of the board. } 4. cxd5 {Expected. } Nxd5 {It blocks and attacks (my knight). } 5. g3 {Perhaps Blitzkov is a fianchetto person here on his king side.  It takes time to develop a fianchetto. } Bg7 {The King's Indian is designed to use the fianchetto. I was later than earlier to start it.  } 6. Bg2 {So he does the fianchetto. } Nxc3 {I have pressure on his d4 pawn while making a trade to isolate his "a" rank pawn. Why not?} 7. bxc3 {So now his "a" rank pawn is isolated in a trade. I am happy so far. } e5 {With this move I make him trade queens at the outset before he can castle. He should not take my e5 pawn unless he wants to risk a centrally fixed king without shelter. } 8. e3 {So he is ahead of my thinking and knows the fault there....} exd4 {I am playing a 14 year old. And is he smart!  When he came into GK I thought he was just an ego that needed an ego beating.  So I do get a trade to open up my own fianchetto (the only time, usually, I ever employ the fianchetto is in the King's Indian Defense. It is a solid defense against d4 to date). } 9. cxd4 {He had to go this way. If he had done e3xd4 then his pawns (and pawn skeleton) would be compromised. } c5 {I do this to engage but mostly to allow my queen to move about the d8-a5 diagonal. At the same time I am still ready to do QxQ if d4 takes c5. In the latter case White can't really castle. In the former case ????} 10. Bb2 {Another fianchetto move by blitzkov! Well, it is time to put him into check...} Qa5+ {He can only do qd2 or just sit back for an onslaught.  By this time I know my 14 year old opponent is going for qd2. } 11. Qd2 {Well. Well Water. Well whatever. This guy is not easy. But I am feeling okay and still thinking I can dry out his well of maneuver....} Qxd2+ {I get that King in motion....} 12. Kxd2 {I can't do anything so I want to safe guard my king as well as get a rook out. } O-O {So I got the rook out....} 13. Ne2 {He had to free the rooks into a tie together now. Rooks work better together. } Rd8 {I am just making it harder for white to use that pawn to take c5 pawn. Anytime a king is in the line of fire a pin is always recommended. } 14. Rhd1 {White is anticipating my next move....} Nc6 {Okay I say....} 15. Bxc6 {There it goes. } bxc6 {I think by this time I felt we were equalized. I have stacked pawns. His King is in the center ahead of my own. I have two bishops instead of his knight and bishop. I'd always prefer two bishops over two knights or one bishop and one knight. } 16. Ke1 {He knows his king needs to get out of where he was. } Rb8 {I have to do something in return to be alive.  I can't take the d4 pawn. It is protected x4 and I hav4 x3.... } 17. Bc3 {Expected for me...} Bg4 {A pin to align my rooks x2. } 18. Rab1 {An offer to trade rooks and deal with the after math. } Rxb1 {I think it is best to deal with this....} 19. Rxb1 {Aftermath here. I have stacked pawns where his rook can come and get me and create havoc. I am thinking I have to take out the knight straightway....} Bxe2 {He has to trade. } 20. Kxe2 {So he does. } cxd4 {I am actually trying to clear the board for freedom. Get the stacked pawn out and get more maneuver. } 21. exd4 {Expected. } c5 {I attack d4...} 22. Rd1 {He defends d4.} cxd4 {I take it. } 23. Bb4 {He leaves it. } f5 {I advance. } 24. Kd3 {He centers his king....} Rc8 {I prevent his king from moving and take an open rank with my rook....} 25. Bd2 {He is re positioning his bishop to a better location...} Kf7 {My king is behind in getting out....} 26. Rc1 {Oh no! } Rxc1 {I have to do it. } 27. Bxc1 {So there it is....} Ke6 {I am getting Him out there...} 28. Kc4 {He is sidestepping...} h5 {I decide to advance on the left...} 29. f4 {He decides to quell that....} h4 {I decide to engage....} 30. Bb2 {He decides to shift...} d3 {I decide to give him a run for his money....} 31. Bc1 {He attacks d2 square. But in the meantime....} Bf6 {I am advancing on the left (for black). } 32. Kxd3 {Now his king is coming to intervene...} Kd5 {So I am advancing my King to help out...} 33. gxh4 {Those pawns on h rank can't go anywhere dangerous or even to promotion. I've got my bishop if g6 fails.} Bxh4 {This was a pawn to take in the taking.  in retrospect I think this is where I sort of screwed up.  But not at the time....} 34. Be3 {King and bishop facing me off...attacking my noble pawn. How dare he?} a6 {What else?} 35. Ba7 {This?} Be7 {I wanted to be able to do something about both h2 and a2 pawns at this point. It is not an aggressive move I admit but our kings are face to face here off color to attack from oppositional bishops. One bishop is always dedicated to one color and that makes it difficult when you have a bishop and the other has a bishop...} 36. Bb8 {Protecting his f4 pawn with his h2 pawn in the same diagonal....} Bf6 {I am trying to get my bishop BEHIND his lines..} 37. Bc7 {He is just waiting and making HIS bishop a bit more flexible....} Bd4 {Trying to get behind HIS lines....} 38. Ba5 {He is just moving and moving...} Bg1 {I am behind his lines and attacking.  He has three isolated pawns and I have only one....} 39. h3 {Expected but when you can force a move you are ahead....} Bd4 {I brought the bishop back to go to the right side (black's) because the h3 pawn is trapped anyway. } 40. Bb4 {Not ready to put my bishop into c5 for anything...instead} Bf6 {See if I can do something on the left to release action there....} 41. Ba3 {Why not f8 instead I am thinking....Why ba3 instead?} a5 {I have no idea and this is the time to advance on the right to a5.} 42. Bf8 {Now he goes there! Is this timing?} Bb2 {I want to attack the f4 pawn...} 43. Be7 {It looks good to go for....} Bc1 {There I go.} 44. Bg5 {This will be a draw and I know it. A freeze.  But, I want to test it out for a 14 year old to be a bit blundering....} Ba3 {Let's see what he does....} 45. Bd8 {Okay. } Bc1 {Better to go back to the left side (black's) to deal with this....} 46. Bxa5 {Okay.} Bxf4 {I didn't think he'd take the pawn. He did. My mistake. } 47. a4 {A reward for my mistake. } Kc5 {Thinking I still have two pawns on the left and all I have to do is put my king into the side pawn to restrict...} 48. Ke2 {It is so slow with kings. They only get one square at a time...} Kc4 {One square at a time....} 49. Kf3 {One square at a time. } Bd6 {Best place for my bishop...} 50. Bd2 {Equal best place for his bishop...} Be5 {I feel by this time it is drawn for sure....} 51. h4 {Nothing here is convincing me otherwise.} Bd6 {I am still thinking about it. } 52. Be1 {So is blitzkov...} Be5 {I am giving him time to do something miraculous....} 53. Bd2 {He is not in the mood for a victory and neither am I. }
