1. Nf3 {I hope you find these comments entertaining and informative Dino53/Barry Davis.} d6 2. d4 Nd7 3. e4 e5 {My introduction I would like to remind our players that pawns have 4 job functions; a.  Protect the king b. Protect other pieces c. Fight for territory & space d. The threat of promotion. } 4. d5 {This is a decision based on taste or preference white last move "releases the pawn tension" in the center and therefore clarifies some issues about what is going in the center.} Ngf6 5. Bd3 Be7 {With blacks last move he choose a well know variation of the Old Indian Defense, it is solid & a little passive. But I have used this option against players who are very aggressive!} 6. c4 c6 {Black used his last move to place "pawn tension" on the spearhead of whites center formation, which in-effect keeps him busy!} 7. Nc3 O-O 8. a3 a5 {Black is very alert!  8. ...a5 "restricts whites option to gain more space on the queen-side and slows whites plans down.} 9. Bd2 Nc5 10. Bc2 Qb6 {This move is very ambitious, remember if you go into another mans house you had better have a way to get out!  Remember a battery is any two pieces placed along a file, rank or diagonal that when you move one it release the power of the other!} 11. b3 {OK a passive response, that does not take advantage of all of the possibilities available.} cxd5 12. cxd5 Qa6 {Black is attempting to "dictate the direction & flow of the game", by challenging white and presenting him with problems! The weakens of the a6-f1 diagonal is glaring now white try to stop the Nd3+ with interrupts his plans!} 13. Qb1 Bg4 {Notice the energy and strenght of black plan and the execution of his ideas!  First he did the three things we should always strive for in the opening,  1. Fight for control of the center 2. Develop our pieces toward the center & 3. Castle our king and now by presenting white with problems to solve he has strategical won game, white inability to castle will haunt for the rest of the game. With black last move he } 14. Be3 {he connects his rooks, and his the option to ruin his opponents pawn structure!} Rfc8 15. Bxc5 {Black is playing this game with great enegry, he "increases the activity of the Rf8 and will make the decision about the destruction of whites pawn structure later! Often it is said that the "threat to do something is greater than the execution"!} Rxc5 16. Bd3 Qa7 17. Nb5 Qb6 18. a4 Bxf3 19. gxf3 Nh5 20. Rg1 {Notice that white struggles but he has given up the dark square bishop, what would "control the dark squares" and now black is in-effect a piece to the good since white cannot compete on this color complex!} Nf4 {Good stuff the occupation of the outpost continues to "increase the activity of blacks pieces and create new problems for whites pieces.} 21. Bc4 Bh4 {A very strong move, creating a "threat against the f2 square, & yes the Qb6 & Rc5 make up a battery along the a7-g1 diagonal! Always look for unprotected pieces now white will try to protect the f2 square.} 22. Ra2 Rxb5 23. Bxb5 Qe3+ {Invasions...alertly exploiting the pin & the lack of cooperation within whites positions!} 24. Kf1 {2 to protect the f2 square and with white light square bishop mis-placed black is able to take advantage of the weakness on the light squares on the king-side!} Qxf3 {Pac-man notice the oblagation of Qb1 to protect the pawn of e4, the Ra} 25. Rd2 Rc8 {Good players use all of their pieces!} 26. Qe1 Qh3+ {A well played game that any player on our team would be proud to have played keep up the good work!}
