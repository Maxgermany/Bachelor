[Opening "Two knights defence (Modern bishop's opening) (C55)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 {The Italian Game (sometimes called the "quiet game"). In this opening, both sides opt for rapid, conservative development.} 5. O-O {Nc3, Bg5, or even Qe2 were playable as well.} d6 6. Bg5 {Develops and pins the black knight against the black queen.} h6 {0-0 or Bg4 were more conservative options, as this move starts to weaken a presumed castled position. However, the slow pace of this opening was obviously not up to Steinitz's tastes.} 7. Bh4 {Maintaining the pin against the black queen.} g5 {Black makes the first truly aggressive move of the game. It is apparent that he aims for an assault on the kingside.} 8. Bg3 h5 {! I give this move an exclamation point simply because I am jealous of the calculating ability of Steinitz. By making it, black is willing to sacrifice his g pawn in exchange for the chance to further harrass white's dark squared bishop. } 9. Nxg5 {White takes him up on his offer, and now has EXTREME pressure on f7.} h4 {! Another exclamation! Steinitz has dedicated himself to assaulting the enemy camp. The question is - can he stave off the effects of white's next move?} 10. Nxf7 {?! Bxf7  was better. White gets too cute trying to show off with this fork against black's queen and Rh8. Surely Steinitz will play Qe7 (or possibly Qd7) to save his queen...................right?} hxg3 {Wrong! Steinitz sacrifices his queen!  What in the world could he possibly be planning?????} 11. Nxd8 Bg4 {Develops his light squared bishop with an attack on the white queen.} 12. Qd2 {?! Perhaps Qc1 or Qe1 was better.} Nd4 {Keeping his attack going full throttle, black gets more firepower closer to the prize. Notice the latent danger posed by black's dark squared bishop.} 13. Nc3 {White completes development.} Nf3+ {! A Royal Fork sacrifice! } 14. gxf3 {Forced, if white wants to maintain his queen. However........} Bxf3 {White is now out of options...................the fat lady is singing.} 15. hxg3 {Any move that doesn't remove the pawn on g3 will lead to it going to g2, and a rapid mate delivered after black gets his knight to g4.} Rh1# {A brilliant gem of sacrificial chess. I've never seen so much accomplished with so little against such a strong enemy position. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas}
