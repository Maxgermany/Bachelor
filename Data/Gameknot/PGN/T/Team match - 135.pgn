[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian Defense.} 2. exd5 {Lasker variation of the Scandinavian Defense.} Qxd5 3. c4 {Pc4 actually seems to work out better for black.  White does better responding with Nc3 or Nf3.  Putting a knight into the field. } Qe6+ 4. Be2 b6 {...out of the database.} 5. d3 a5 6. Be3 Bb7 7. Nf3 Bxf3 8. Bxf3 Nc6 9. O-O O-O-O 10. Nc3 h6 11. Bd5 Qg6 12. Qf3 {I like this move--it is the first one I saw too.  Puts pressure on Nc6 and Pf7.} Ne5 13. Qf4 {Oops, NxPd3 will make the white queen move again, giving black a free pawn while protecting Nd3 with the queen.  Black might even end up with Pb2.} f6 14. Be6+ Kb8 15. Nb5 {Black has RxPd3 or QxPd3.  The knight (Ne5) is protecting Pc7.} Rxd3 {Black chooses the rook.} 16. Bf5 {Really nice.  QxPd3 would have allowed black to move Qe2, about the only square out of harm's way, but which attacks Pb2.} Qg5 {Ah, good recovery.  White is denied its choice of high value pieces.} 17. Qe4 Qh5 18. g4 Qh4 19. f3 g6 {BxPg6 seems like a free pawn.  NxBg6 would be answered with QxRd3.} 20. Bxg6 c6 21. Rfd1 {The black rook could escape to d7.  Or trade.} Rxd1+ {Trade it is.} 22. Rxd1 cxb5 {While it looks like black is ahead, Rd8+ gives white Bf8.  So looks can be deceiving.} 23. cxb5 {The bishop was worth more.} Bg7 24. Rd8+ Kc7 25. Rd4 {Mm, I'm thinking Qa8 looks like more fun.} Qe1+ 26. Kg2 Qe2+ 27. Kg3 Qxb2 28. f4 Nxg6 {Qc6+ looks like force mate.} 29. Qc6+ Kb8 30. Rd7 {I think I would have gone with Rd8+ here.  Kb7 is forced, followed by QxPb6#.  Actually, it makes no difference.  Black has no move to defend against Qb7#.  Qg2+ would be a pointless delaying tactic.} e5 31. Qb7# {}
