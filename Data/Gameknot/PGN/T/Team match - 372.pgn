1. e4 {And another annotation at the request of a team mate!} d5 2. exd5 {This is the Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01), White correctly takes.} Qxd5 3. Nc3 {This is the Lasker variation. I like white's move, attacking the queen.} Qa5 4. Bc4 {3. d4 is more common, but nothing wrong with this...} Nf6 5. Nf3 {both knights come out} c6 6. O-O {Both sides develop. c6 is often played by Black to give an escape square to the queen after d4 and Bd2 or, less usually a3 and b4} Bg4 7. Be2 {White just wastes a move in retreating the Bishop. Re1, h6, d4 or d3 were all better. White is just a tempo down on the main line now.} e6 8. d4 {At last!} Bb4 {This position has actually occoured in other games, but Black played Be7, Bd6 or Nbd7, all of which are stronger, because of what follows next....} 9. Bd2 {Both sides develop} O-O 10. a3 {A logical move from white, putting the question to the bishop} Bxc3 11. Bxc3 {So white has obtained the two bishops, in an open position.} Qc7 12. Ne5 {This isn't really a bad move, but I would have thought it better to preserve the white squared bishops. Maybe moves like b3 followed by Bb2 and c4 is a better plan? What do you think dear reader?} Bxe2 13. Qxe2 {So Bishops are exchanged} Nbd7 14. Nxd7 {White rather falls in with White's plan here. Maybe White could play 14. Bb4 hitting the rook on f8, and after it moves, play Nc4 and maybe playing a bishop or knight into d6 at some point. Or maybe just playing Nd3 maintaining the tension. White has a slight spacial advantage in the centre, thanks to the pawn on d4 and so should be avoiding exchanges.} Qxd7 15. Rad1 {Sound development by white.} Nd5 16. Bd2 {White wisely avoids the exchange on c3.} Rfe8 17. Qg4 {White seems to be dreaming of a king side attack, but with so few minor pieces left on the board, it is not really on.} Nf6 18. Qg3 {Still dreaming of attacks....} Ne4 19. Qd3 {The queen is driven away. Black could just exchange on d2 and it will be hard for either side to make much of the position.} f5 20. Bf4 {White may have an edge now, the Bishop can go to e5....} Rad8 21. c3 {I don't like c3, I prefer Be5} Nf6 22. h3 {h3 seems a waste of time} c5 23. Be5 {At last!} Qd5 24. f4 {Interesting position. White is weak on the white squares and Black is weak on the black squares!} Nd7 25. Bc7 {This doesn't do much good, the exchange on e5 is still coming up.} Rdc8 26. Be5 {The bishop has to retrun here. If 26. Ba5? b6! and it is lost for a pawn.} Nxe5 {So the exchange happens} 27. dxe5 Qb3 {I am not sure why Black plays this. After a queen exchange the ending should be drawn.} 28. c4 {Black sets a trap} Red8 {which black falls into!} 29. Qxb3 {Oops! 1-0! Thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two, and rate my annotation with a star or two!}
