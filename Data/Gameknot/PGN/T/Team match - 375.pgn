1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. e3 Bg4 4. Be2 Bxf3 {I would not have initiated this bishop for knight trade.  I prefer bishops....especially in the early game.} 5. Bxf3 Nf6 6. Na3 {For the most part, I think it is usually best to have the knight on C3, rather than A3.  The knight on C3 is much more powerful and can really impact the center of the board more efficiently.} a6 7. O-O e6 8. c4 Bxa3 {This time, I think the bishop for the knight is a good trade for windowman.  Now gfb3 has double pawns on the A profile....a really weak position.} 9. bxa3 a5 10. c5 {At this point, I feel that black has a much better board position....but watch how he loses it rather quickly.......} h5 11. e4 h4 12. e5 {And there we go.....black's good board position is completely gone.  He kept advancing his pawn down the H profile....I don't know why he did.  Now gfb3 has the upperhand!} Nd7 13. Qb3 Nxd4 14. Qa4 Nxf3+ 15. Kh1 {I'm not sure why gfb3 didn't take the knight.} Nfxe5 16. Bf4 Nc6 17. Rab1 Nxc5 18. Qc2 {Black should win.  Although his board position is not great....he has a large piece advantage} Ne4 {This is the first of black's very poor moves to blow the game.  I would rather have done pawn to b6.} 19. Rxb7 O-O {By doing this move....black gives up a free knight} 20. Qxc6 Nd6 21. Rxc7 {gfb3 does a great job of punishing black for their mistakes in recent moves.  Black's board position is terrible here.} g5 22. Bxd6 {Black gives up another free knight} Re8 23. Be5 {At this point....now gfb3 has a huge advantage.  } f6 {bad pawn move by black} 24. Qb7 {great move by gfb3!} Re7 25. Rxe7 Qxe7 26. Qxe7 {The game is over!  Good job gfb3!  You were at a disadvantage for most of the game.  However, black made some bad moves and you took advantage of it!  Sometimes that's how you win you know?  I know I've won some games where I made some mistakes in the early game but then my opponent made some mistakes in the mid game.  I was able to take advantage of his mistakes and come back for the win.  In essence, I felt this game was won due to black's poor play in the mid game.  He had better position and piece advantage...but made some grave errors and gfb3 made him pay for it!  At this point the game is basically over and I don't have any more relevant thoughts on the game.  Congrats gfb3!  Good game!} fxe5 27. Qxg5+ Kf7 28. f4 Rh8 29. fxe5+ Ke8 30. Qg6+ Kd8 31. Qxe6 {}
