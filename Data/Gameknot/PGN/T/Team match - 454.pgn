1. e4 e6 {My name is Jason Capablanca and I am 9. I am going to make an analysis for you on my game against Strikerx. I do not make many analysis for you to read because now I am playing a lot of real hard players, and my games do not look so good any more. And I do not play e4 very much here any more because then I have to know a lot of different openings and I am going to a hard school, so I do not have time to study openings so much until summer time. I always do my best and I do not quit. I am writing this analysis because the French Defense is very hard to beat and I had to study with my coach Mr. Marble, a lot last year to know how to play it when I went to the Olympiad last year. Maybe this will help you.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {Nd2 breaks a lot of rules. I learned this last year. Black is also breaking a lot of opening rules, so it is okay for White to break rules too. White can play 3. exd4 (exchange variation) 3. Nc3, or 3. e5. Nc3 and e5 are hard for White to hold onto the pawns in the middle and exd4 looks good but it does not get an advantage for White. It helps Black get his c8 Bishop out. Black wants White to play e5 so he can start attacking d4. My move is for the Tarrasch variation. Sometimes this Knight goes all the way to f3 so there are lots of pieces defending d4. That happened in this game.} Nf6 4. e5 {4. e5 I like this variation, because it makes Black waste another move with the Knight, and Black must decide where to put the Knight. It always should go to d7 so it can help Black play c5 to attack the pawn on d4. But the extra moves let me get my pieces out.} Nfd7 5. Bd3 {I only have one chance to get this Bishop out. After that Black will attack my pawn on d4 and I will not have time to take him out again.} c5 {c5 This is the attack on the center Black is supposed to make. And it is why I played Nd2. You do not see why yet. But you will.} 6. c3 {This is the best I think. When Black takes the pawn on d4, it will be replaced with another pawn. That is important to control the middle with pawns and to keep the extra space the e5 pawn has given me.} Nc6 {6. ..., Nc6 Do you see how many pieces Black can aim at d4? It is hard to find enough defenders. That is why I played Nd2. You will see why.} 7. Ne2 {7. Ne2 This is why I had to get my f Bishop out on move 5. I must develop this Knight to e2 so that I can have lots of defenders for d4.} c4 {7. ..., c4?! This is a mistake. It is not part of the opening. But it is not a mistake because of that. It is a mistake because all of the French Defense depends on Black taking the pawns in the middle. Do you see how all of Black's pieces are on the Queen side? I saw this and I was confused. How can Black get his pieces out in the game if they are trapped behind his pawns on the Queen side?} 8. Bc2 b5 {8. ..., b5 Now I think I see. He is changing his attack to the back of the pawn chain. he si going to try to aim at c3. But his pieces do not work so good to do this. } 9. O-O a5 10. f4 {10. f4 I can not let Black do all of the attacking. If I do, he will find a way to win. So I will try to open up the pawns in front of Blacks King. He is not developed and his King is not safe. So maybe I can get him in the center.} g6 {This makes all of the dark squares on the King side good for my Bishop.} 11. Nf3 {11. Nf3 This move is made most of the time to give another defender to d4. That is why I made Nd2 at the beginning. See how both Knights defend d4? I do not need that now, but my Knight is in the way of the Bishop, and I am going to attack his King side, so It should go over there anyway.} b4 12. Be3 {12. Be3 Maybe this is not so good a move. But if he takes my pawn on c3, I will take with my pawn on b2 and I will be able to control the open b file because my Rooks and Queen are all working together now. So I did my best to find a move to help make him not want to take c3. But I think maybe Ng3 would be good.} Rb8 13. Ng3 Be7 14. f5 {14. f5 see I waited too long for Ng3 and he is getting his pieces working together before I can play f5. I was trying my hardest but he has a rating over 1700 and he is a real good player. So I was afraid maybe I made this into a draw, and it would not help the team win the match.} gxf5 {14. ..., gxf5! I hoped he would take with the e pawn. Then I could play 15. Bh6, bxc3 16. bxc3, Bf8 17. Qc1 and he does not dare take my Bishop because my Queen will take back and I will be able to attack his King side. But this way he get's an open file for his Rook. And it will aim at my King. } 15. Nh5 {I am hoping to get on f6} Rg8 16. Bh6 {I do not just want to guard. I want to attack. I was hoping I could play Ng7+. That would leave me a lot of good tactics. His King would move to f8 and then I could play Nxe6!! which is a discoverd check on the King, so I would win the Queen.} Qb6 {16. ..., Qb6! You see he is a good player. He knows what I am trying to do. He could have played Bf8, and I would have played Qd2. And I do not get to win his Queen this way either. When I was playing before, Knelica would let me play easier players and this would work, but now my tricks do not work. This is not so bad though. Now the Queen is really trapped behind her pawns on the Queen side.} 17. Kh1 {Never leave your King in front of a enemy Rook unless you have no choice.} Ba6 {Ba6. He is connecting his big pieces.} 18. Qc1 Kd8 {See. He must get his King out of the way. He is trying to get his big pieces on the open file.} 19. Ng5 {19. Ng5! Now Knights are real mean when they are up towards the front. So I am getting them way up front. They will take away all of the squares for his pieces. So he can not let me leave them there. He must trade them away as fast as he can.} Bxg5 20. Bxg5+ {20. Bxg5+ He is a good player, and he will not let me keep my Knights up forward. He knows to trade them. So I do not get so good an advantage.} Kc7 21. Nf6 Nxf6 22. Bxf6 {22. Bxf6 Now I do not get to have any Knights. This is bad because there are lots of pawns on the board, and Bishops are not so good when there are so many pawns in the way. Now I must do what Black wants me to do. I must make pawns go away. So I have to find a good way.} Rg6 23. Rf2 Rbg8 {His doing what he planned but I have two defenders on g2 and he can not get any more attackers there. So I am not so worried.} 24. Bd1 {My White squared Bishop is not very good because of his pawn on f5, so I am going to give it a job to do. When there are no ways to win pieces my coach says make your pieces better. It is going to make his Rooks go backwards and stay behind his pawns. You see? His Bishop is trapped. So His Knight is trapped. Even his Queen is trapped. So If I make his Rooks go backwards he does not have a way to get me.} Bc8 {24. Bc8? He missed what I was doing with my Bishop. He had to move his Rook on g8 out of the way.  } 25. Bh5 {25. Bh5 Finally I get to win something. } Bd7 26. Bxg6 hxg6 {26. ..., hxg6 Maybe he should have taken with his Rook. His only open file now is the h file, and he can not put his Rook on it because my Bishop attacks h8. All of his pieces are trapped now.} 27. Qh6 {I am trying to get a way to win the Rook or the pawn on f7.} Qb8 {He sees it, so I wasted time.} 28. Qf4 Na7 29. b3 {29. b3 I can not win the game on the King side. His King is not there, and everything is guarded. } bxc3 30. bxc4 dxc4 31. Qc1 {31. Qc1?! My opponent told me this is a wrong move. He is right. I should have played d5. Opened the file so he could ont protect the pawns and so I would have the open file. This is the only way I could see to get those pawns and I would be right in front of his King.} Bc6 32. Rb1 Qc8 33. Qxc3 Qa6 34. Qa3 Nb5 35. Qe7+ {Now I can finally get my pieces into his back ranks.} Bd7 36. Qxf7 {So now I can start to win his pawns and he will not be able catch up.} Re8 37. Rfb2 {I do not think he can defend everywhere now. His only chance is Kc8 so he has enough pieces to defend the Knight. } Rb8 38. a4 {Now he will lose more material. So he resigned. I want to thank strikerx for a good game. He is a real good player and he just made a change in the start of the game that did not work. He got his pieces trapped and that is to bad. I hope this helps you if you play against the French. My mom helped by typing what I said. So if there is a big mistake, it is her fault. LOL}
