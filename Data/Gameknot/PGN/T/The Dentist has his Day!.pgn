[Opening "KP (C20), Napoleon's opening"]

1. e4 e5 2. Qf3 {2. Qf3 - an unusual opening, this is called the Napoleon Opening.  It is not as easy to exploit as you think and although I play out the recommended lines of the database things are about to go belly up big time for me.} Nf6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 d6 5. Ne2 O-O 6. b4 Bb6 7. h3 a6 {7. ......... a6 - this is where I start to play conservatively, a little too conservatively.} 8. a4 Ba7 9. d3 h6 10. Be3 Bxe3 11. Qxe3 Qe7 {11. ......... Qe7 - the dsb exchanges do nothing to relieve my cramped position.} 12. g4 Nh7 13. Ng3 Be6 14. Nd2 Qd7 {14. ....... Qd7 - maybe I should have exchanged bishops while I had the chance!} 15. Nf5 Bxf5 16. gxf5 Qe7 17. Nf3 Nd7 {17. ........ Nd7 - I complete my development but white has a clear advantage in space and a dangerous mating attack develops.} 18. a5 Ndf6 19. O-O-O Nh5 20. Rdg1 Kh8 {20. ...... Kh8, escaping from a pin down the g file.} 21. Rg4 Nh7f6 22. Rg2 Nf4 23. Rg3 Nf6h5 24. Rg4 {24. Rg4 - a curious knight manoeuvre holds things together on the kingside but not for long!} Qf6 25. Kc2 Rfd8 26. d4 Qe7 {26. ......... Qe7 - I moved my rook to d8 hoping to contest the centre but it is not to be.  White slowly improves his position while I am reduced to shunting Glenda from e7 to f6.} 27. h4 Qf6 28. Kb3 Qe7 29. Ng1 Qf6 30. Nh3 Kg8 31. Nxf4 exf4 {31. ........ exf4 - white now forces an exchange of knights opening up the position.} 32. Qf3 Kf8 33. Rg2 g6 34. Qg4 Rde8 35. Qf3 Ng7 36. Qxf4 h5 {36. ......... h5 - I have just lost a pawn and I will soon lose another.} 37. Qh6 Ke7 38. fxg6 Reh8 39. Qg5 Qxg5 40. Rxg5 f6 {40. .......... f6 - the exchange of queens does not improve my position and I am now 2 pawns down.  I play on for a few more moves with a heavy heart.} 41. Rg3 c6 42. f4 Rad8 43. d5 Rhe8 {43. ............. Rhe8?? - loses another pawn.  I overlook the fact that the a pawn will fall after dxc6 giving white another passer.  As soon as I realised this I threw in the sponge before my opponent replied on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Even taking into account my playing history with the Dentist and the 300  point difference in our ratings I felt that there was nothing left to play for.  This was the second time in the space of a week that I lost to U1400 oppo.  I dropped 17 points against cbarracuda.  Luckily this game was unrated so my rating was not affected.  At the time of the resignation my rating was 1679 and my opponent's was 1348.  A sorry tale.  Do you think I under-estimated my opponent here or do you feel I simply played passively and paid in full?  You the jury decide.}
