[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 {*back one*} d5 {Scandanavian defense. The intent is to rip open the center and wrest initiative away from white immediately.} 2. exd5 {The most common response. 2. e5 is also very playable.} Qxd5 {To maintain material equality, black must violate one of the "sacred" opening principles by developing his queen very early. This move inevitably invites.........} 3. Nc3 {! Developing a piece while attacking the exposed enemy queen.} Qa5 {A seemingly awkward, yet proven solid square for the queen. } 4. Bc4 {White starts a rapid piece development  to take further advantage of black's uncoordinated and underdeveloped pieces.} c6 {A key component in this version of the Scandi. Black must create an escape path for his queen. Black is pinning his hopes on strong flank attacks once white dominates the center of the board.} 5. Qf3 {? An over-zealous attempt for a quick mate on f7. Better was Nf3, e3, or even e4.} Nf6 {Black protects the weak f7 while attempting to get caught up in development.} 6. Nge2 {Since f3 is occupied, white develops this knight to the next best square with the idea of castling quick.} Bg4 {! This move proves the fallacy of white 5th. Black develops with aggressive tempo.} 7. Qg3 {White must reposition his queen or lose it. Notice that it has now moved twice, while no pawn stab at the middle or developing move for the dark squared bishop has been made yet. White is allowing black the opportunity to catch up in development.} e6 8. a3 Nbd7 {Logical. Be7 was also playable.} 9. O-O {White secures his king. IMHO, this move was a bit premature, as the white king is under no imminent attack and the dark squared bishop needs to get active. Not a bad move, just far too conservative.} Be7 {Black develops his last piece and prepares to castle.} 10. h3 {While still neglecting development, white is annoyed by black's light squared bishop and forces it to move.} Bh5 {? An outright blunder. Black will drop the pawn on g7 with no compensation. Castling kingside will now be impossible as well. And yes, I did sing the four letter word song when I realized what I had done. } 11. Qxg7 {! White takes the freebie. I wish I could claim that I knew what I was doing here, but I wouldn't want to lie:)} Rg8 {Black attempts to get SOMETHING out of this deal. Rook to half open file is generally good strategy. This move turns out to be extremely strong as black will now own the g file with some aggressive tempo, as the enemy queen can now be chased. I would have given this move an "!" if I had seen how telling it would be, but once again I can't lie to you:)} 12. Qh6 {Forced.} Rg6 {Black now continues the harrassment of the white queen, and wants to be perceived as "having a plan". If there is such a thing as a "bluff" in chess, this is it.} 13. Qe3 {Practically forced. Now the smoke has cleared a bit, and white is  1. His strategy should now be rapid development of his dark squared bishop, followed by wholesale exchanges so he can press his pawn advantage.} O-O-O {! Black now starts aggressive manuevers. The inkling of a plan of attack begins by getting forces mobilized over to the kingside.} 14. Nf4 {?! Apparently very strong. White threatens both bishop and rook. } Rh6 {Black protects the stronger of the two.} 15. Nxe6 {!! Outstanding move! Both black rooks are now vulnerable. I was debating whether or not to just resign this nightmare at this point, as a strong player such as gibonacci should have no problems converting a rook advantage to a win. And then it occured to me that since white was dominating with such an underdeveloped army, it may be worthy to play a few more moves. I'm glad I hung around:)} Rg6 {! Since d8 could be safely recaptured by his queen , black decides to reclaim the half open g file.} 16. Nxd8 {Logical.} Qxd8 {Black now sees the possibility of giving white one heckuva headache. Do the math - black's advantage of  6 pieces (queen, rook, bishop, bishop, knight, and knight) vs. 4 pieces (queen, rook, bishop, and knight) can be pressed if white continues to neglect his development and starts pawn grabbing.} 17. Qxa7 {? White accepts the "bait" and gets greedy. Black is safe from a back row attack because his Nd7 can block. The resulting position means black will have Q, R, B, B, and N vs. R, B, and N in the attack zone. So...................} Rxg2+ {!! BOOM! (I never get the chance to give myself two exclams, so please pardon my hubris:) Black has strong impetus should white recapture.} 18. Kxg2 {White seizes the chance to go  9. The problem with that idea is that he cannot get reinforcements over in time to accurately defend.} Qg8+ {Step #1 - throw a mean check while protecting g4 (yes, g4 - Black sees the killer tactic:) White cannot play 19. Kh1 because of 19...Bf3  20. Kh2 Qg2#. White must play Kh2 to prolong the agony.} 19. Kh2 Ng4+ {!!Step #2 - Keep up the pressure. If 20. hxN, then 20...Qxg. 21. Rg1 would fail to 21...bd6  22. Kh1 Qh3# or 22. f4 Bxf  23. Kh1 Qh3#. If 20. Kg1, then 20...Ne3  21. Kh1 Qg2# [21. Kh2 Qg2#]. If 20. Kg2, then 20...Ne3  21. Kh1 Qg2# [21. Kh2 Qg2#]. So black makes his only other legal play........} 20. Kh1 {Which promptly fails to..................} Bc5 {Attacking the enemy queen, and more importantly hitting the weakened f2 square. White is hurting here - if he checks on the back rank, it will be easily blocked by Nb8. If he takes the bishop, he loses his queen. As it turns out, this was his only play, but it fails as well to the same line after 21. QxB NxB Instead, he opted to simply preserve the queen.........} 21. Qa5 Nxf2+ {Which just made things easier. (22. RxN BxR and mate follows on g1. 22. Kh2 Bd6#). A fascinating game which was a pleasure to be a part of! My applause to my opponent gibonacci for a game well played! I hope you have enjoyed------ Thomas:)}
