[Opening "Dutch with c4 & Nc3 (A85)"]

1. d4 f5 {One of my favorite choices against 1...d4.  The Dutch has many variations, but it has a justifiable reputation for giving black a lot of play on the king-side......if white does not blow him out on the queen-side.} 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. Nf3 Bb4 {4....Bb4  This move has some risks.  Yes, it permits black to develop quickly and to fracture the queens-side for white, but it also opens up attack points for white into black's position, and without the king's bishop that black often needs, especially when black's queen's bishop appears so walled in by its own pawns.  Not in this game however.} 5. a3 {White can stop the doubling of the pawns after 5....Bxc3+, with either 5. Qc2 or 5. Bd2.  But these alternatives may delay the deployment of white's pieces to the best squares.} Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 O-O 7. e3 b6 {This bishop will come to dominate the board, especially as it bears down on white's king-side.  My alternative to 7...b6 was 7....d6 8. Be2 Qe7 9. O-O Ne4, which was favorable to black in Adamik-Kaiser (Prague KS op-A, 2007), or instead 7....d6 8. Be2 Qe7 9. O-O e5, which was also favorable to black in Nardmann-Garmann (Rheinland op, 1997).  Still another option is from ECO, and that is 7....c4, to establish a stonewall position, with a possible triplet pawn for white?!!} 8. Bd3 Bb7 9. O-O Qe7 {There are a lot of choices here for black: ...Ne4, ...Qe8, ...Nc6, and ...d6.  I chose 9...Qe7 partly to vary from the main lines, and partly to steer the game into a fairly clear division of deployment between black's coming king-side attack and white's queen-side assault.  Who will inflict damage first?} 10. a4 a5 {It is possible to ignore 10. a4, since its aim is primarily to squeeze black's queen and rook on the a3-f8 diagonal with 11. Ba3.  But black has sufficient resources to defend against this, and so I calculated that I had time for 10...a5. } 11. Ba3 d6 12. Rb1 Nbd7 13. Rb5 {13. Rb5 is an interesting idea, and I have not seen it in any games so far where 12. Rb1 has been played.  I can see how it could rupture the center pawn mass with an eventual d5 or c5.  But I was already formulating an attack of my own on white's king.  } Ne4 {The king-side attack begins.  This means I will have to allow any moves he makes in the center later, like c5 or d5. } 14. Qc2 Rf6 {There are a few similarities between this game and Duneas-Wohl, Queenstown Classic (1-20-2009), which had these moves: 1. d4 e6 2. c4 b6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 Bb7 5. Nf3 f5 6. a3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 Nf6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. O-O d6 10. a4 a5 11. Rb1 Nbd7 12. Ba 3 Ne4  13. Qc2 Rf6 14. Ne1 Rh6 15. g3 Qg5  16. Be2 Nxg3 17. fxg3 Qxe3+ 18. Rf2 Qxg3+ 19. Kf1  Qh3+ 20. Ng2 Rg6 21. d5 Qxh2 22. Bf3  Ne5 23. Ne1 Qg1+ 24. Ke2 Nxc4 25. Qb3 exd5 26. Nd3 Re8+  O-1. Everyone should be able to see those similarities, such as the rapid deployment of the rook and queen to the king-side and the resulting pawn weaknesses there.} 15. Ne5 {A very nice try to rattle the position.  This caught me by surprise.  I realized I might have to sacrifice my knight on d7 if I were to keep the attack going.  That was my choice. } Rh6 16. Nxd7 Qh4 {I don't think he expected this.  The queen now enters the king-side and starts to compromise the pawn structure there.  Can I recover the missing knight?  Well, that was irrelevant to me now, as long as white's knight could inflict no other damage.} 17. h3 Ng5 {The bishop on b7 is now in play, and it will assume a major role in the destruction of the white king's position.} 18. Bxf5 {I was expecting 18. f3 Nxh3+ 19. gxh3 Qxh3 20. Qg2 Rg6 21. Qxg6 hxg6 22. Kf2 (otherwise 22...Qg3+ 23. Kh1  Kf7 and 24...Rh8++) Qxf3+ 23. Ke1 Qxe3+ 24. Be2 Qxc3+ and 25. Qxa3. In this variation, black can recover white's knight with ...Bc6 and take complete command of the game.} Bxg2 {The computer calls this a blunder, and recommends instead 18...exf5 19. Qxf5 Rg6 20. Qxg6 hxg6 21. Bxd6 Bxg2 22. Rxg5 Bxf1 23. Bxc7 Qxg5+ 24. Kxf1 Rc8 with a +6.17 positional/material advantage to black.  But the computer did not calculate the psychological effect this bishop strike had. } 19. f4 {The computer calls this a blunder, and recommends 19. Kxg2 exf5 20. Qxf5 Rg6 21. Kh2 Rd8 22. c5 dxc5 23. dxc5 Nxh3 24. Qxh3 Qxh3+ 25. Kxh3 Rxd7 26. cxb6 cxb6.  I expected 19. Bxe6+ Nxe6 20. Qf5 Be4!} Be4 {The computer called this a mistake, but ranked it a +1.86 material/positional ranking in any case for black.    The computer preferred 19...Bc6 20. Qh2 exf5 21. fxg5 Qxg5+ 22. Kf2 Bxd7 23. Qg2 Qxg2+ 24. Kxg2 Re8 25. Rb2 Rxe3 26. Rf3 Rg6+ 27. Kf2, with a +3.31 material/positional ranking for black. } 20. fxg5 {A blunder.  Even though black is down two pieces, the remaining fire power is more than enough to finish off the white king. Now it is over in two moves.   The computer recommends 20. Qh2 exf5 21. fxg5 Qxg5+ 22. Kf2 Bc6 23. Ne5 dxe5 24. Rxe5 Qg4 25. Qg3 Rxh3 26. Qxg4 fxg4 27. Rg5 Rf3+ 28. Ke2, with a +1.81 positional/material ranking for black.} Qg3+ {}
