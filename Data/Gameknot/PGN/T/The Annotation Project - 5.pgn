[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 {A move as common as sunrise.} c5 {Sicilian, I see it a lot in expert play, and I have been playing it more frequently lately.  I figure if the big boys play it, it must be good!} 2. f4 {This is the Grand Prix Attack. } d5 {Pretty standard play so far. } 3. Nf3 dxe4 {The knight has to go somewhere. Standard chess dogma tells us that moving a piece twice before developing the other pieces is not the best practice. } 4. Ng5 {As good a spot as any for the knight.  Better than going back to the home square any day. } Nf6 {Black develops a knight, guards the advancing pawn on the e file and clears a spot kingside perhaps in hopes of a castle later. Having played this game, I know that is a dream. } 5. Bc4 {White is throwing some firepower at f7. Makes 4 Ng5 look a lot smarter!} Bg4 {Black goes after the White Queen. With White's f pawn advanced so far the queen can only be protected by the knight or bishop which means "backward advancement" for white!} 6. Qxg4 {What?} Nxg4 {well, D'oh!  Thanks for the queen white, nice trade! But white has plans for the double attack on f7. White seems to believe that the positional advantage was worth the Queen. } 7. Bxf7+ { This is the first move by the "real" players. Yikes! Was my first impression of Blacks position when these games started. As black, I felt like I was in trouble, even with the queen advantage! } Kd7 {The only possible move. } 8. Be6+ {White gets a little material back with this move. } Kc6 {I choose the move c6 over c7 to keep the c pawn close and to allow escape into the corner after clearing the Queen's Knight and rook and a6 ... that was my idea anyhow.} 9. Bxg4 {Bye Bye knight! now black is only up 3 points, but the queen advantage is helpful. White is still in good position and black's defenses are pretty shaky. } g6 {I'll be honest, I moved here because it was the most popular move in the GK DB. I was worried about Ne6, but that should result in trading bishop for bishop and white must be careful about trading to blithely due to the queen deficit. } 10. Nc3 {White prepares to castle. Without a queen in the fray, protecting the King is paramount!} Na6 {Clearing space for my king on the home row, I hope I can manage to get him back there!} 11. Ngxe4 e6 {Giving away this pawn, but the black diagonals it blocked had to be cleared.} 12. Bxe6 {Now only one point up... have I squandered the queen advantage? } Nb4 {I see a chance for a King / Rook fork.} 13. O-O {Damn, that plan was dashed quickly!} Nxc2 {Still, a pawn is a pawn, and I need to gain all the material I can!} 14. Bd5+ Kd7 {Not sure if that was really the right place for the King, but I didn't like the prospect of ...Kc7 15. Nb5+} 15. d4 {I think he threw the pawn out hoping I'd miss the dangling rook.} Nxa1 {but I didn't.} 16. Be3 Nc2 {Right back where I started, and attacking the bs bishop, as well as the d pawn.} 17. Bf2 {The only sensible move in my estimation. } cxd4 18. Nb5 {A lot of white pieces in my area, I don't really like that, but my material advantage is much better with the rook in the bag.} Ne3 {It's to my advantage to trade pieces now. And the fork is rather nasty with his ws bishop unprotected.} 19. Rc1 {? I think BxN would have been the better move, at least he white would not go down another whole piece. } Nxd5 {Thank you very much!!} 20. Bxd4 {The passed pawn could have been troublesome, but white's material advantage is beginning to take it's toll on black.} Rg8 {lining up on his King.} 21. Rd1 Qa5 {Trying to force the N@b5 back. } 22. Nf6+ Kc6 23. Nxd5 {It's unclear to me why White did not nab the rook.} Qxb5 {Even trade. Exactly what white did NOT need.} 24. Nf6 {I think I'll move the rook @ g8. } Rg7 25. Rc1+ Kd6 {I don't like playing with my King in the wide open like this. White has a couple of chances for check.  Plus, I have a rook that seems to be paralyzed in corner... never good to leave the big iron out of the fray!} 26. Be5+ Ke6 {Hiding behind his pieces is about my only option here.} 27. Re1 {White wants a discovered check. } Re7 {I have to get my rooks involved, so I allow the discovered check.} 28. Bc3+ Kf7 {White can't trade rooks at this point. } 29. Rf1 Re6 {Opening the diagonal for my bs bishop.} 30. Nxh7 {A last ditch effort. } Bc5+ {he can lose the rook with Rf2, or the game with Kh1. A good game, and an interesting gambit by white in the beginning. }
