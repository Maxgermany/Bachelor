1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {Hmmm, odd though this may be, this is almost a new line to me. I don't like Nf3 as it seems to be too passive - database likes Nb5, and I like the threat of Nd6  afterwards, so I'll go with that.} 5. Nb5 Bc5 6. Nb1c3 {Still holding onto the option of Nd6 , but trying to develop other queenside pieces for a possible queenside castle. I'm expecting 6... Nf6 7. Bg5, meaning that the Nd6  exchange will allow a queenside castle straight afterwards.} a6 {Ok, my hand is now forced.} 7. Nd6+ Bxd6 8. Qxd6 Qe7 9. Qd1 {This is in the database, but it does seem slow. On the other hand. It leaves an effective Nd5, threatening Nc7 . If Qd6 then Nb6 with a discovered attack on the queen is nice. If Qd8 then black has had to retreat the queen back out of the game for the time being.} Nf6 {Attacking the pawn and protecting the d5 square.} 10. Bg5 {Seems an obvious move, clearing the queenside back rank and again threatening Nd5} Qe6 {Removing threats from the previous move. Tempted with b3 and Bc4, and then taking the Kingside castle instead. However, capturing seems to give me the previous threat of Nd5 that I liked so much, so it seems more consistent with my long term plan.} 11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. Nd5 Qd6 13. Nb6 Qxd1+ 14. Rxd1 Rb8 {Sequence as expected from previous analysis. I absolutely love the knight on b6 now.} 15. c3 {Removing b4 and d4 from the black knight.} Nd8 16. Bc4 {Continuing development - Black is very cramped now.} Ne6 17. O-O Nc5 {Threatening Nxe4 and allowing the kingside castle, as it provides the extra defence for d7.} 18. Rfe1 O-O {Now d7 has two defenders again, and I should be able to chase the knight away and take the pawn.} 19. b4 {Knight can only retreat to e6 now.} d5 {This just seems to drop the pawn anyway, so it seems a slightly strange move.} 20. Rxd5 Ne6 21. Nd7 Bxd7 22. Rxd7 {Pawn is now gained and the open file controlled :)} Nf4 {Seems strange, it has nowhere to go if threatened, so I'm just going to chase it away.} 23. g3 Nh3+ 24. Kg2 Ng5 25. h4 Ne6 {Now I have a bit more development and black is back to the position a few moves ago. Not only that, but the f pawn can now be taken I think after Bxe6 and Re7.} 26. Bxe6 fxe6 27. Re7 Rfc8 {Aha, cunning. Ok, I'll take two pawns for the one I lose at c3.} 28. Rxe6 Rxc3 29. Rxe5 Rc2 {Actually, with the risk of Rf8 this is slightly awkward. Will try to hold on to the pawn.} 30. a4 Rf8 31. Rf5 Rxf5 32. exf5 Rc4 33. Rb1 Kf7 {Feels like I'm juggling plates now. Gained the solid two pawn advantage but absolutely no ability to return pressure to black. Need to sort the kingside pawn structure and get the king over to help out on the other side. I think 27. Re-d1 would have been much stronger. This gamble has not worked out well.} 34. Kf3 Kf6 35. g4 h5 {No way to defend here. White's pawns are a mess.} 36. g5+ Kxf5 37. Kg3 Rg4+ 38. Kh3 b5 39. axb5 axb5 40. f3 Rd4 41. Kg3 g6 42. Rb3 {Position is now locked, and I cannot see any way out other than a draw, so offered and accepted on move 42.  Game annotation for team benefit --}
