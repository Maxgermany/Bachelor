1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {Regular opening, nothing special} d5 3. Nxe5 Qe7 {Not what I expected, I expected d5-e4} 4. d4 c5 {Attack on my knight's defender. It seems I wasn't thinking so well at the moment} 5. Qf3 {I'm still asking myself why I did that. It's just a really stupid move.} cxd4 6. Qf4 {Now I have to defend my knight, queen unusable...} f6 {I can't move my knight, because I would lose my tiny grab on the center. So, this is what I figured out.} 7. Bb5+ Bd7 8. Bxd7+ Nxd7 9. Nxd7 {after a couple of trades my knight has moved and I have one turn to focus me on the center.} Kxd7 {I didn't know why he used his king to take my knight} 10. f3 dxe4 11. Qxe4 Qb4+ {Now it becomes clear, he can now use his queen, otherwise he couldn't} 12. Bd2 {That, was a foolish move, nearly the foolishest I made in this game.} Qxb2 {I could expect it...} 13. Qg4+ Ke7 14. Qe4+ {I'm trying to use a couple of checks in a row, you know, perhaps, there will be a chance.} Kf7 15. Qd5+ Kg6 16. Qe4+ {Check after check after check...} f5 17. Qe6+ Nf6 {hmmm, kinda impossible to give him a check right now...} 18. g4 {So I move this, when he moves Qa1, I move Qf6++ mate.} Re8 {Finally, it turned out to be totally foolish... I lose my queen AND a rook.} 19. gxf5+ Kh5 20. Qxe8+ Nxe8 {as said, I lose my queen.} 21. Rg1 Qxa1 {I lose my rook but I figured something out. With my next move everything will become clear} 22. Rg5+ {He has to move Kh4, because Kh6 leads to Rg3+, Kh5, Rh3++ mate.} Kh4 23. Rg4+ {I'm just following the king.} Kh3 24. Kf2 Bd6 {Here he blundered, when I move Bg5 it's a mate in two! check this puzzle: http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=34115} 25. Bg5 Bg3+ {The last move that makes it a bit longer} 26. hxg3 {This is where black resigned. He was winning, but with a bit of luck. I won!}
