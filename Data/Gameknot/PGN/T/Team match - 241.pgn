[Opening "French (C10), Rubinstein, Capablanca line"]

1. e4 e6 {This is the French Defence. I used to play it a lot, so I know what is coming.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 {This is something different than the closed positions arising from moves like 3...Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 etc.} 4. Nxe4 {This called Rubinstein Variation. } Nd7 5. Nf3 {I can also play 5. Bd3 which can lead to the same kind of positions than in this game.} Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ {I practice I have to exchange the knights anyway. For example, 6. Bd3 Nxe4 7. Bxe4 Nf6 8. Bd3 etc.} Nxf6 7. Bd3 {There are other moves here that I could play, such as Bg5, c3, Be3, Bc4 etc. The one that I selected takes the e4-square and potentially targets h7.} c5 {This is logical. Black challenges the central control by attacking d4.} 8. O-O {I could take on c5, but instead, I move the king to a safer place. There is a little tactical trick that makes this possible, although d4 is threatened.} cxd4 {Black takes it.} 9. Nxd4 {And I take back! 9...Qxd4 would be followed by 10. Bb5+ winning the queen.} Bc5 {So Black develops a piece with tempo.} 10. Nf3 {Keeping it simple.} Qc7 {Now I cannot pin the f6-knight.} 11. Bg5 {I still move the bishop to g5, because other active squares are covered by Black pieces. I also have the option to break Black's kingside pawn structure.} O-O 12. Qe2 {Breaking the pawn structure here is probably not worth losing the bishop pair.} b6 {Preparing to bring the bishop to b7.} 13. Ne5 {This is a good square for the knight.} Bb7 14. Rad1 {The rook takes the open file.} Nd5 {I do not like this move. Bringing a rook to oppose mine on the d-file would be better, I think.} 15. c4 {Driving the knight away.} Nb4 {This seems like a good move, but it is not.} 16. Bxh7+ {Surprise! Black steps into a trap.} Kxh7 {What else?} 17. Rd7 {This is an important move.} Qc8 {The queen must retreat.} 18. Bf6 {Making it more spectacular than necessary. 18. Qh5+ Kg8 19. Bf6 also works.} gxf6 {If Black does not take, White delivers checkmate anyway. For example, 18...Kg8 19. Qg4 g6 20. Qxg6!! fxg6 21. Rg7+ Kh8 22. Ng6#} 19. Qh5+ {Not the fastest way to win. 19. Rxf7+ Rxf7 20. Qh5+ Kg8 21. Qxf7+ Kh8 22. Ng6#} Kg8 {19...Kg7 is not better. } 20. Ng4 {This is a bad move which allows Black to defend a bit longer. Instead, 20. Nxf7 wins: 20...Bxf2 21. Rxf2 Kg7 22. Qh6+ Kg8 23. Qh8# or 20...Rxf7 21. Qxf7+ Kh8 22. Qh7#} Qxd7 {This returns the favor. Instead, 21...Be7 22. Rxe8 Qc5 23. Nxf6+ Kg7 24. Rxb7 Qxh5 25. Nxh5+ etc. and there is no checkmate, although White is two pawns up and probably winning.} 21. Nxf6+ {And it is over.} Kg7 22. Qg5+ Kh8 23. Qh6# {}
