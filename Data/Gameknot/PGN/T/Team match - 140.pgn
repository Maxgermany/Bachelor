1. e4 e5 2. Qf3 {King's pawn, Napoleon Opening.} c5 {This response is not in the database.  Black usually does pretty well moving a knight here, either Nf6 or Nc6 instead.} 3. Bc4 {Ok, this is the famous four move checkmate.  Black must guard against QxPf7#.  Qe7 would probably work.} d6 {Nope.  Blunder.  QxPf7# -- game over.  Black has lost.} 4. Bb5+ {Blunder.  QxPf7# (that little hash mark or pound sign means check mate).  The bishop protects the queen against KxQ.  The black king has nowhere to move.  Here black can interpose the bishop, or the knight @ d7 or c6.  I recommend the bishop.} Bd7 {Yes.} 5. Bc4 {Once again black must defend against QxPf7#.} Nf6 {That works.} 6. d3 Bg4 {Always a good idea to chase the queen.  The more white moves her, the better black can develop.  Black DOES have to be careful to keep his forces guarded.} 7. Qg3 Be7 8. Nc3 O-O 9. Nd5 {If white trades knights black's white bishop will be left undefended.} Qa5+ {This move was unwise.  White will almost certainly interpose the bishop, meaning the black queen will have to move.  She cannot position herself to protect Bg4, and NxNf6+ lets white win QxBg4 for free.} 10. c3 {White's mistake gives black only a tiny reprieve.  Here black should probably play NxNd5, since Be7 is completely undefended.} Nc6 {...or this.  This doesn't prevent NxNf6+, BxNf6, QxBg4 (for free) however.} 11. Nxe7+ {Mistake.  This is just an even trade.  Not a bad trade, but white had a better move, previously outlined.} Nxe7 12. Bg5 h6 13. Bxf6 gxf6 14. Qxg4+ Ng6 15. h4 {Black should move Kh7, otherwise Ph5 gives white a knight for pawn.} b5 16. Bd5 Rac8 17. b4 {This move seems questionable.} cxb4 18. c4 {Now black can undouble those pawns.} b3+ {This move--nice.  Even better.} 19. Ke2 bxc4 20. dxc4 {Pb2 seems nice.  White would play 21. Rb1, QxPa2, and a pawn promotion is imminent.} bxa2 {Black's knight remains vulnerable to Ph5.} 21. Nf3 Qc3 {This leaves the valuable Pa2 black invested 5 moves into undefended.  Rb8 would be a better idea.} 22. h5 Rxc4 {The rook (5 points) is worth more than white's bishop (3) and pawn (1).} 23. Bxc4 {}
