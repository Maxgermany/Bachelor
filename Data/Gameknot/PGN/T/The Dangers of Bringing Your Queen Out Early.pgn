1. Nf3 {I am White in this game, and I start with a safe, solid, non-committal opening, which waits to see how Black will continue.} d5 {Black's move is more committal since pawns cannot move backward, and now Black has committed a pawn to the centre. } 2. g3 {I like to develop my kingside quickly and castle safely. My knight and fianchettoed bishop will be good defenders of my king, and also good attackers if Black messes up.} d4 {This move surprised me a lot, and I have never even considered anyone playing this kind of move against me. Black has overextended his pawn, which slightly weakens his position.} 3. Bg2 {Now my fianchettoed bishop will be stronger since Black can no longer block it with d5.} Nf6 {If Black was going to overextend his center early, then he should've at least followed up with c5 to support the weakened d-pawn, and then try for Nc6 e5.} 4. c3 {Maybe this move wasn't quite necessary, but I was impatient to try and take advantage of Black's questionable d4. I challenge the pawn with a less valuable pawn, so if Black trades, I'll have an extra centre pawn, plus an open c-file and big lead in development.} d3 {This was the best move since c5 loses a pawn. 4...c5? then 5.cxd4 cxd4 6.Qa4  Nc6 7.Nxd4!! and I have an overwhelming attack on the c6-knight.} 5. exd3 Qxd3 {Now Black is forced to bring out his queen early, allowing me to gain development tempo.} 6. Ne5 {I can get my knight to a better square while gaining tempo.} Qb5 {I think it was better to undevelop the queen and then try to recover the tempo loss, because now Black's queen is subject to harassment.} 7. d4 Nbd7 {I think it was better to develop the kingside and castle quickly} 8. Nd3 {My knight has moved 3 times, but it is very strong on d3, and now I have a nice grip on the center squares.} Nb6 {This is a terrible move, and leaves Black very behind in development, and I can gain tempo chasing the oddly placed pieces. } 9. a4 {My a-pawn can reach a6 with tempo, for an early attack on the undeveloped queenside, so now Black has no counterplay and must defend.} Qf5 10. a5 Qe6+ 11. Qe2 {I think it's good to trade queens and go into an endgame, where my king is already placed toward the centre, and my advantage is easier to exploit. } Qxe2+ 12. Kxe2 Nbd7 {If Nbd5, then c4 traps the knight.} 13. a6 c6 {Rb8 was another idea, but Black wanted the knight to go back to b8 to defend c6. } 14. Nb4 {I bring another attacker toward the queenside with tempo, since I'm threatening axb7 Bxb7 Bxc6 winning a pawn.} Nb8 {Black's knight has moved 4 times, and ended up exactly where it started. Black's faulty opening play has left him with a defensive underdeveloped position, while all my pieces will find good squares.} 15. axb7 {I trade off a pawn for my opponent's more valuable pawn, while making Black's c and a-pawns very weak. I have superior control of all the board, so I can't blunder away this advantage.} Bxb7 16. Nd2 {I wanted to get my knight to c4, where it's strongly placed, and cannot be chased away by pawns.} e6 {Black is threatening to trade his bishop for my knight, which damages my superior structure} 17. Nd3 Bd6 {Maybe this isn't the best place for the bishop, I think Be7 is better, Black needs to control c5, because Nc5 is a strong place for my knight. I can just harass Black's bishop with Nc5.} 18. Nc4 Bc7 19. Nc5 Bc8 {I have gained so much tempo in this opening, and have excellently positioned pieces. I just need to bring my other rook and bishop into play, to take full advantage of my advantage.} 20. Bf4 {If bishop trades, then gxf4 is simple and I have an overwhelming threat of Nb6, not to mention some pawn winning tactical possibilities.} Nd5 {This defends the bishop, and it will defend the rook after I trade on c7, so then there won't be a pin on the a-pawn.} 21. Bxc7 Nxc7 22. b4 {Now it's time to bring my pawn in to challenge the pinned c-pawn. Black's pieces are ridiculously placed, and I have a threat of b5.} O-O 23. b5 {Perhaps Black didn't see my threat, or maybe he couldn't find a way to defend it. The knight is tied down to defending a8 from my Nb6 threat, and the c-pawn is the only thing blocking my bishop's path. Black will lose an exchange.} Nxb5 24. Nb6 axb6 25. Rxa8 bxc5 26. Rxb8 {I'm up an exchange, but Black will get some pawns, so the resulting endgame will be tough. } Nxc3+ {This move gives me much better winning chances, I think Bd7 gives Black the best chance to draw.} 27. Kd2 {Now Black's knight is in danger, so he doesn't have time to defend my sneaky piece-winning threat} cxd4 28. Ra1 {Black has three pawns for the exchange, but now I win a piece back since there is nothing stopping Ra8. Even if Black plays Bd7, Ra8 is still crushing since taking my rook leads to mate, and I am double attacking Black's rook.} e5 {If Nb5, then Bxc6 Nc7 Ra7!, or Bxc6 Nd6 Ra8 with Bd7 to follow, also winning a piece.} 29. Raa8 {I win a piece no matter how Black continued, but the resulting endgame is still hard since Black is up a lot of pawns.} f5 30. Rbxc8 Rxc8 31. Rxc8+ Kf7 32. Rxc6 {Black has two pawns for the rook, and he is starting to overextend them, I think it's a better idea for Black to keep the pawns back where they are safe.} e4 33. Rxc3 {I sacrifice part of my material advantage, to reach and ending where my material advantage is simpler.} dxc3+ 34. Kxc3 Kf6 35. Kd4 {This move forces Black to let me play Bxe4, which sacrifices more of my material advantage, to give me an even simpler material advantage.} h5 36. Bxe4 fxe4 37. Kxe4 {Being up a rook for two pawns ( 3) was a more complicated ending than when I was up a bishop for a pawn ( 2), and now I have an even simpler ending where I'm up a simple pawn ( 1), for a simple win.} Kg5 38. h3 {All I need to do is restrict Black's king from coming in, and put him in zugswang until he allows my king to come through and push him away from defending his pawns.} Kf6 {If h4, then g4 is simple} 39. f4 {Tightening the barrier} g6 40. g4 g5 {This was Black's last hope for a draw. I must be careful not to play gxh5?? because then gxf4 leaves me with two unpromotable side-pawns, and Black's king can simply go to the corner and draw. A king vs. a king and any number of rook pawns is an elementary draw. No matter how many rook pawns you have, the opponent can draw if his king gets to the promoting corner first, or if it can trap your king in the promoting corner where you're blocked by your own side-pawn.} 41. f5 {I must also not be careful to play fxg5?? because then Kxg5 is another elementary draw. I can't take the h-pawn because it leaves me with two rook pawns, and once Black exchanges on g4, I can't promote my pawn because there is no way for me to get my king in front of my pawn, and push Black's king away. Black has no more drawing tricks, so he just resigned here.}
