1. f4 d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 {Basically the start of this tournament, almost forced except the king might get the chance to reside on e8 instead of c6.} Bg7 {Main line} 10. Ne6 Qg8 11. d4 exd3 e.p. 12. cxd3 {Still main line} Na6 {?! Nd7 or h5 might be better} 13. O-O h5 14. Bf3+ Kd7 {Kd6 might be more effective.} 15. Bd5 Bd4+ {Freddy thought this was rushing it.  Though I had a counter sacrifice in mind because I didn't like the looks of Kc8.} 16. Kh1 Qxe6 {!? giving up the material advantage for some activity.} 17. Bxe6+ Kxe6 18. Nc3 {Threatens Nb5.} c6 19. Be3 Rad8 {Maintains the tension something I've been working on.  Besides Bxe3 Rae1 looks nasty but they lead to about the same thing.} 20. Rae1 Kf7 {Though about Kf5 here though this way the king has some cover.} 21. Bxd4 {Was expecting the best move here f5! but Freddy wanted to simplify.} Rxd4 22. f5 g5 {! Avoiding the trade.} 23. f6 exf6 {Now I'm up pawn but in a odd position as the rooks are bearing down on me.} 24. Ne4 {What I expected after exf6.  I don't know what Freddy's response to Rh6 would have been but I analyzed the position and thought that I'd be okay after Rxd3? Nxf6 Kg6 but Freddy had a nice combination that I missed.  Simply going with my gut and playing Rh6 was probably best here.  I guess I was just trying to hard here.} Rxd3 25. Nxf6 Kg6 26. Ne8 {! threatens mate 26. Rf6+ Kh7 27. Re7+ Kg8 28. Rg7# Best is probably g4 or Rxe8.} Rd7 {? loses a rook} 27. Re6+ Kh7 {Forced} 28. Nf6+ {I resign due to lose of material after Kg7 Nxd7 white has too much going for him.  Just like a Master to pounce when you make a mistake.  Good game Freddy.}
