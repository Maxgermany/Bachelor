1. e4 {The usual drill up to move 9...} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 {I'm still undecided which is better: 8...Kc7 or 8...Kc6} 9. Bxg4 e6 {This seems an odd move by Black, just chucking a pawn away but it has the benefit of freeing up Black's remaining bishop and possibly distracting White from more dangerous moves with his minor pieces.} 10. Nc3 {White concentrates on development.} Na6 {and Black responds likewise, threatening to attack c2 from b4 and thence the K on e1 and the R on a1} 11. O-O {so White quickly castles, taking the K away from that threat and centralising a rook.  Black's potential Queen check from d4 looks harmless at this point.} Nb4 12. Nxe6 {Not tempted by winning the exchange on h8, White tidies up the pawn and shuts off one of Black's King's escape squares.} Qe8 13. d4 {Now the Black Q is off the d-file, White seizes the opportunity to strike at the King's defence and allow the dsb to develop.} Nxc2 {forking the Ra1 and the pawn on d4.  White can't afford to give up more material yet, so ...} 14. Rb1 Nxd4 15. b4 {The rook move was not wasted.  It supports the attack of the b-pawn, opening the lines to the Black King.} cxb4 {? dropping the N on d4} 16. Nxd4+ Kc7 17. Nd5+ {forcing the King back} Kb8 18. Be3 {The bishop finally gets out and blocks Black's passed central pawn, also looking at a7.} Bc5 {Black too develops his B to cover that line of attack and aim at White's King} 19. Nxb4 {Clearing away another obstruction on the way to Black's King and threatening Nc6+.} Bxb4 20. Rxb4 a5 {Black desperately tries to create an escape for one of his rooks} 21. Rb5 Ra6 {further defends c6 and creates an escape square fro the King.} 22. Rfb1 {doubles up the attack on b7.  All White's forces are now aiming towards Black's king and his environment.} Qf7 23. Be6 Qc7 24. Bd5 {and Black has had enough, because he can't defend both c6 and b7 properly and will suffer further devastating loss of material and eventual mate}
