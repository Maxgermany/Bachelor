1. d4 d5 {Hi everyone!  Here again, Operation Joblock has become my Expert opponents' chief nemesis.  It has sentenced about 10 out of 13 of such opponents to many hours of head scratching, teeth gnashing (so much so they may well need a visit to my buddy The Dentist ere long!) before they either hit the offer draw button or click on the yes button in response to my draw offer, or, in the case of the Master Mater, he decided to try and sac material before he in turn ended up allowing a draw by repetition.  This MT starts off with the Mason Variation of the Queen Pawn Opening, which is 1.d4 d5 and 2. Bf4.  My opponent decided to develop a piece with 2. ..... Nf6.  Gameknot analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15195165&fb=1&rnd=0.849941270083969} 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 e6 4. Nd2 {4. Nd2 - if black should plonk his knight on e4 then I can trade it off immediately.} c5 5. Ngf3 Nc6 6. c3 Bd6 {6. ..... Bd6 - both sides develop their pieces and black offers an exchange of bishops.  The DB advises against immediate exchange of prelates however.} 7. Bg3 O-O 8. Bd3 Qe7 9. Ne5 {9. Ne5 - this knight move leads to a series of minor piece exchanges.} Nd7 10. Ndf3 Ncxe5 11. Nxe5 {11. Nxe5 - one knight replaces another on e5.} c4 12. Bc2 f5 13. Nxd7 Bxd7 14. Bxd6 Qxd6 {14. ...... Qxd6 - now all the minor pieces but the light square bishops have been traded off.  The position looks roughly equal.} 15. O-O {15. 0-0 - I decided to tuck Henry away on the kingside.} b5 16. a3 a5 {16. ...... a5 - allo, allo - here comes a queenside pawn storm.  I now decided to shift all my major pieces over to the queenside after black decided to do likewise.} 17. Qd2 Rfb8 18. Rfb1 Kf7 {18. ..... Kf7 - even though the queens and both sets of rooks are still on the board, black brings his king out for the endgame.  With my position all closed up, Glenda cannot take advantage of this.} 19. Qc1 {19. Qc1 - I certainly do feel that there is gonna be a major piece stouche on the a and b columns so Glenda moves to c1 to protect the b2 pawn (hence her sobriquet Glenda The Defender!) and to ensure that black will not be able to take control of either the open a and b columns when the a and b pawns are traded off.} g6 20. Bd1 {20. Bd1 - this move looks passive but Fou Leblanc controls both the d1-a4 and the d1 to h5 diagonals.  This will be of some significance a few moves on.  Please note that black has all bar one of his pawns on the same colour square as his bishop.  These pawns will hem him in, haha!} b4 21. axb4 axb4 22. Rxa8 Rxa8 23. Ra1 Rxa1 24. Qxa1 {24. Qxa1 - after the rooks have been exchanged, Glenda takes control of the open a file.  Black tries to contest the b column by moving the Wicked Witch of the West onto that file.  But never fear, my stalwart defender, Glenda has this all sussed and covered.  Her better half, Henry edges towards the centre.  I intend a move such as g3 and moving Henry to g2.  This solidifies my position making it very hard to break down.  From a seemingly open position, that Joblock strikes again!  On moving Henry to f1 I decided to offer a draw here.  Gameknot Analysis showed the position to be slightly in favour of black so it was a good draw offer, netting me a handy 6 rating points, keeping my rating in the high 1700s.  Hope you have had a nice weekend all of you and a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne} Qb6 25. Kf1 {}
