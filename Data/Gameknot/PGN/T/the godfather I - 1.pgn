1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {imposed moves} 6. Bd3 {smooth choose} e5 {offensive black} 7. Nb3 Be6 {this leads to a variant where black can castle.} 8. O-O Be7 9. Be3 b5 10. a3 O-O {white is just a little bit more advance in development, but it is without consequence. I guess we can consider the position is almost a draw. I am not sure about the theory, but, as white has castled on the king side, it has lost an opportunity to press sooner the d6-pawn which is in this position (as far as I know) the black weakness} 11. Be2 Nbd7 {this lead white to press the black center. Maybe it was not very clever. My intention was to forbid the dark bishop to have any ambition on the b6 square.} 12. Nd5 Nxd5 13. exd5 Bf5 {strange position for both players. the f5-bishop is uncomfortable and has to find a good position soon, but on the other hand, white has abandoned the possibility to a direct pressure on d6.} 14. Bd3 {i am pretty sure this is a mistake} e4 {of course e5 was protected by d6, but on the other hand, the possibility to develop soon f5 was a good security to operate this attack on a pretentious bishop.} 15. Be2 {back home.} h6 {preparing an eventual havre for Bf5} 16. Nd4 {of course this threatens more c6 than f5, but i have to protcet my bishop first.} Bg6 17. Nc6 Qe8 {only move. the position is scary, but there is no direct threat.} 18. Nxe7+ Qxe7 {who win with this exchange? My bishop was not very active, but, on the other hand, he could have become fastly with Bf6. On the other hand, the Nc6 was active and protected... So, i think it is a loss for white.} 19. Bd4 {I don't see any pecular threat here. On the other hand, it cut my queen and my knight for some moves... that I was of no intention to do.} f5 {as planned.} 20. Qd2 f4 {double impact: cut white intention to put the queen on f4 (I guess), and attacking as planned...} 21. Bg4 {once again, we are not sure of the intention. My knight is not active and the possibility of a check on e6 is not really interesting. or is it?} f3 {the attack is more and more dangerous. } 22. g3 {what could white do? Taking was not very interesting, and let me take was not interesting at all...} Bf5 {my own bishop was no more interesting, and the white g4 bishop was an obstacle to a direct attack on h3} 23. Bxf5 Rxf5 {now, all my force are just about to be on the king...} 24. Rae1 {i think this is a really bad move: white is blcoking twice is own king for an eventual necessity of escape.} Re8 {the idea was to free my queen, upon to go on g5 or f7} 25. Be3 {looks like I cant go on g5...} Nf6 {this was supposed to be a deviation move: I double threatened the d6 pawn, so it could lead to the idea my goal was d5. But actually, white thought my goal was to go on g4... and, any way, d5 was lost, so...} 26. h3 {yes, the idea is not so bad: to avoid a Rxd5 followed by the "evil" Ng4, at least white avoids this last one.} Qf7 {but i never was my idea.} 27. Qa5 {I guess white still saw d5 as my goal (but why putting my queen as a third attacker?), and decided to counter-attack. It gave me one more free move.} Qh5 {this leads to the inevitable next 3 moves.} 28. h4 {if Kh2, then Ng4+ and forced the return of the king and mate in 2.} Qg4 29. Kh2 {no othe move to avoid my queen on h3.} Nh5 {Key move!} 30. Rfg1 {another move that has no real impact on the defense: g3 was not really threatened.} Nf4 {but now, h3 is really threatened} 31. Bxf4 {forced. If gxf, then Qxh4x} Rxf4 32. Qxa6 {Idem: g3 cannot take f4. On the other hand this move is definetly too optimistic.} Re5 33. Qxb5 {White is now 2 pawns ahead but a small amout of moves away of complete defeat.} Rh5 {there is nothing more white can do... Unless I missed something.} 34. Qb8+ {a last check} Kh7 35. Qd8 {the idea was generous: protecting h4 from the back...} Rf6 {but black had the key for it: now, there is no more move. Even Rxe4 only retards the end. white resigned. Thanks, verybig.  I have to recognize my opponent gave me some opportunities, but I am glad of my e5-e4-f5-f4-f3 moves which lead to the victory. I guess some stronger player would have found an easier way... I am not at all convinced that I played the most decisived moves. But I liked the movement and intend to improve on this tactic.}
