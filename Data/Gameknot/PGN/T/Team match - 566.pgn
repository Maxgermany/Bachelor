1. e4 {When I am playing White, I like the Scotch} e5 2. Nf3 h5 {h5 was unexpected.  Wonder if he has some kind of trap.  Will go ahead and take the pawn} 3. Nxe5 Qh4 {Qh4 was also unexpected.  Looks like this will not be a standard Scotch game} 4. Qf3 {Qxf7 would be mate} Nf6 {It blocks the mate but it seems to isolate his Queen.  Two attacks on the e pawn, guarded only once.  Nc3 will defend the e pawn and get a Knight out.  He will probably chased the knight at some point.  If he doesn't chase the Knight, I will either do d4 or Bc4.  Bc4 would give an attack on Black's f pawn.} 5. Nc3 {got to defend the e pawn - attacked twice defended once} d6 6. Nd3 {don't like have to touch the knight so many times and it is still not in a good place.  cant push the d pawn.} a6 7. Nf4 g5 {going to have to move the knight again.  considered Nd5 but settled for Ne2 so I will have some time to do either d4 or d3. With all the stuff Black has on the kingside, I thinking castling Queenside.  } 8. Nfe2 {I think his queen is in danger of being boxed in} Be6 9. d3 {So intent on pushing the pushing the pawn, I overlooked the free knight} Bg4 {Now I will take the knight } 10. Qxf6 Rh6 11. Bxg5 {In retrospect, I should have Qxh6.  after Bxh6, g3 traps the queen} Rxf6 12. Bxh4 Rg6 13. Nd5 {The thinking at the time was Nd5 then Nc7 forking the King and the Rook} Nd7 14. Nxc7# {I did not see the checkmate until after Black's move.}
