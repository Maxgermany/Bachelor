1. c4 {English opening.} e6 2. e4 {Nc3 or Pd4 are popular responses, whereas Pe4 seems to favor black slightly.} d5 3. cxd5 exd5 4. exd5 Qxd5 5. Qa4+ c6 6. Nc3 Qd6 7. Ne4 Qd8 8. Nf3 Nf6 9. Bd3 {Nope.  Nothing protects Bd3 from QxBd3.} Bd6 {So much for QxBd3.} 10. O-O O-O {BxPh2+ may seem like a bad idea, but black comes out a pawn ahead with QxBd3.} 11. b4 Qc7 {White wrecks black's castle pawns with NxNf6.} 12. Bc4 {Nope.  Now Ne4 is free, sacrificed for nothing.  Later on black will play Pb5, a pawn fork of the queen and bishop.} Nxe4 13. d3 Nf6 14. Bg5 Ng4 {Ph2 is overpowered.  Ph3 might work.} 15. h3 {:)} Nh2 16. Nxh2 Bxh2+ 17. Kh1 Be5 18. g3 {Black moved Be5 to attack Ra1.  This move also abandons support of Ph3, now susceptible to BxPh3.} Bxa1 19. Rxa1 b5 {...as foretold on move 11.} 20. Bxb5 Bxh3 {The bishop, PxBb5, was worth more.} 21. Bxc6 {Terrible idea.  Better would be Bc4.} Nxc6 {White should defend against Qe5, netting Bg5 in a bishop/rook fork.} 22. b5 Nd4 {Out of the frying pan, into the fire.} 23. Qxd4 Qb7+ {White loses with Kh2 or Kg1, and must interpose the queen, Qe4.} 24. Kh2 {Black should have programmed Qg2#.} Bd7 {Blunder.  It was game over.} 25. a4 Rae8 26. f4 f6 27. Bh4 Re2+ {Game over again.  White cannot interpose, and Kh3 or Kg1 end with Qg2#.} 28. Kg1 {}
