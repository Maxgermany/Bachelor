1. e4 c5 2. b3 {The Snyder Sicilian variation (played by none other than Master Short). I had meant to play an Alapin with 2.c3 but didn't realise I had played b3 instead. I'm quite fond of the queenside fianchetto in general, so it was just a little mind-slip and fortunately I'm quite familiar with the position. With best play White doesn't really obtain an advantage in the opening, but what matters is who is more familiar with the resulting positions and plans. With this position, White looks to get the dark squared bishop working through the center to the kingside from the start.} e6 {Generally, it's agreed that 2...Nc6 with plans of e5/d6 are the most testing. The resulting positions can be quite subtle, although White does have ways of keeping it more open. Typically though, you'll find Sicilian players will tend to their favoured structures though, which are perfectly fine. With 2.e6 Black looks to ensure c4 is a poor square for the light-squared bishop and develop flexibly.} 3. Bb2 {Naturally the bishop is going here - everyone knows it, so no sense playing something else which may limit responsive options.} Nf6 {Black develops the knight, but as in many similar structures is able to be chased away with e5 which is then supported by Nf3. } 4. e5 Nd5 5. Nf3 Nc6 {White's d-pawn is going to be a liability during the game, unless it can be exchanged through the typical opening of the Sicilian structures. Nc6 makes this difficult as the e-pawn will be free in the event of a d4, cxd4, Nxd4 exchange.} 6. Bb5 {So, in this position we play the thematic Bb5 looking to exchange off Black's good knight and impact the pawn structure for a target to play against later. If a6 is played, it's a wasted move since White fully intends on the exchange.} a6 7. Bxc6 dxc6 8. O-O {I believe Black recaptures with the right pawn to try to generate some counterplay against the weak d-pawn. Opening the b-file wouldn't have given him as much to play against. White's position may appear to be quiet, but development is slightly better and the pieces are more coordinated. The knight on b1 can sometimes be troublesome to develop well in these positions - however it has a good perch with Nc3 to Ne4 where it is nicely centralised and the advanced e-pawn prevents f4 from chasing it away. The d4 push to open the position may now also be a possibility for White.} Be7 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Ne4 f5 {I think Black may have been better with b5 to get the queenside pawn mass working for him (which isn't nearly as weak as many would believe). I suppose that Black was looking to chase away the knight...} 11. exf6 e.p. {But forgot about e.p. Now White has a weak e-pawn to try to work against as well.} Nxf6 12. Qe2 {A stronger move than just simply exchanging knights as it allows for development through recapture while connecting the rooks. The plan will be to exchange some pieces off the board to try and take advantage of the pawn weaknesses.} Qd5 {Black looks to double attack the knight defended once, but the threat is eliminated through simply exchanging. The Queen on d5 is also susceptible to being kicked with c4, which is a thematic square for the pawn in these positions to further secure the center.} 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. c4 {The Queen is displaced with a free exchange on the bishop.} Qf5 15. Bxf6 Qxf6 16. Ne5 {Centralising the knight to strike into enemy territory, allowing for some play with the f-pawn to further control the center. (perhaps the a2-c4 wing with a f4-h2 wing, supporting the knight, and rooks in the center?). The knight controls the king's potential flight square of f7.} Qg5 {This allows for a potential exchange of Queen's, which will fix the problems with the d-pawn through the exchange, as well as for a more effective f-pawn push.} 17. Qe3 Rf5 {Black declines the exchange, which allows for White's Queen to strike at the hanging c5-pawn if the 5th rank can be cleared up through the intended f4 push.} 18. f4 Qd8 {? Qe7 to defend the pawn was better. The weak d-pawn is, in effect, poisoned due to back-rank threats (remember the knight controls f7)} 19. Qxc5 Qxd2 {?? The Queen is now able to be pinned by the rook to the threat of Rd8.} 20. Rad1 {If the Rook gets to d8, then the game is over and Black has no way to defend against the mate. The only piece available to defend is the f5-rook which can be exchanged off with Rxf8 and the queen supporting the convergence square of f8.} b6 {Black hopes to simply exchange off Queen's, but there is no need as the b-pawn hangs and the Queen can threaten from b6 as well.} 21. Qxb6 Qc3 22. Rd8+ {Now mate is forced} Rf8 23. Rxf8+ Kxf8 24. Qd8# {}
