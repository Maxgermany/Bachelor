[Opening "Vienna (C27), `Frankenstein-Dracula' variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {Preparing for a variation of the Vienna game with strong, immediate pressure against f7.} Nf6 3. Bc4 Nxe4 4. Qh5 {Black was expecting Nxe4 where d5 forks the bishop and knight.} Nd6 5. Bb3 Nc6 6. Nb5 g6 7. Qf3 f5 8. Nxd6+ {Nxd6?? A critical error. Of course Qd5 which I had prepared earlier--one of the problems of correspondence chess I've noticed. } Bxd6 {The threat was, after Qd5, Nxd6 and mate at f7. If black's queen came out to protect, then Nxc7 winning the rook.} 9. Ne2 e4 10. Qe3 Qe7 11. d3 exd3 12. Qxd3 b6 13. Bh6 {Now white is taking advantage of black's poor pawn structure and piece placement--his payment for getting a pawn and chasing me all over.} Bb7 14. O-O-O Nb4 15. Qd2 Bxg2 {Bxg2?? Instead of castling and saving his game white is pawn grabbing and misplacing another piece.} 16. Bg5 Qg7 17. Rhe1 h6 18. Ng3+ {Ng3+! There is no good move here--...Be5, then Rx e5+...Qxe5,  Qxd7 + with various winning scenarios.} Kf8 19. Bf4 {Looking to penetrate to the seventh rank or win the knight on b4.} Bxf4 20. Qxf4 c5 {c5?? loses on the spot.} 21. Qd6+ {And black, staring at mate, resigns. You could hardly find worse squares for all of black's pieces to be.}
