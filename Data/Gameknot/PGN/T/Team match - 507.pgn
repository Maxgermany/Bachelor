1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 {3. exd5  The Exchange Variation of the French Defense.  Always interesting, though not as dynamic as many others, like the Winawer or even the Classical lines with 3. Nc3 and 4. Bg5.  It tends to lead to more drawish positions, but I have never encountered a quiet game playing against it.} exd5 4. Nf3 {4.  Nf3.  Alternatives are 4. Bd3, 4. Nc3, and 4. c4. } Bd6 {4....Bd6.  I considered 4...Nf6  5. Bg5  Be7  6. Bd3 Bg4  7. O-O  Nbd7 with near equality, as in Fishbein-Wright, Chicago 2002, but decided to see what happens here.  As it turned out, we ended up nearly following the Fishbein-Wright game.} 5. Nc3 c6 6. Bd3 Nf6 7. O-O O-O 8. Bg5 Bg4 {8...Bg4.  I wanted to get this "bad bishop" out of the box before playing the solid following moves with the Queen's knight.} 9. h3 Bh5 10. Be2 {10. Be2.  The computer rates this an inaccuracy and prefers 10. g4  Bg6 11. Ne5 Bxd3 12. Qxd3 Re8 13. Rfe1 Nbd7 14. Nxd7 15. Bxf6 gxf6 16. Kg2 Re6 with a sdlight edge to W. However, I saw all the exchanges as leading quicker to a draw, so his choice of 10. Be2 looked interesting to me.} Nbd7 11. Nh2 {11. Nh2  The computer analysis here prefers 11. g4 Bg6 12. Nh4 Qb6  13. Nxg6  fxg6  14. Rb1 Rae8  15. Bf3 Bb8  16. Bg2 Re6 17. Qd3 Rfe8 18. f4 with a dead even position.  I thought it was a likely waste of time for him to spend two moves to get his bishop exchanged, but I saw no clear edge i could create here.  } Bxe2 {11....Bxe2.  I did not expect to have the chance to exchange my "bad bishop" so I took it when it appeared.} 12. Qxe2 Re8 {12....Re8.  I considered 12....Qb6 13. Qd3  h6 but decided to try moving the Rook first.  } 13. Qf3 Qc7 14. g3 {14.  g3.  This creates a slight pawn structure weakness that I will exploit later.  But it seems necessary here, given the bad location of the knight on h2.  This certainly highlights the problem with 11. Nh2. } Re6 15. Rfe1 Rae8 16. Kf1 {16.  Kf1.  The computer is all over this like a cheap suit, indicating that Black's best response is 16...Qb6 17. Rxe6 Rxe6 18. Bxf6  Nxf6 19. Qd3  Ne4  20. Nd1 Bc7  21. Nf3  Re8  22. Rc1 Bd6  as the path the game should now follow.  But I had other ideas. } Qb6 17. Ng4 {17. Ng4.  This looks like a mistake, but will I be able to capitalize?  Should I now just trade the Rooks down so I can then pick up the Queen's Knight Pawn?  Maybe, but I wanted to exploit the tension along the e-file a bit more.   } Qxd4 {17...Qxd4.  The computer does not like this, and suggests that 18. Nxf6+ Nxf6 19. Bxf6 gxf6 20. Rxe6 fxe6 21. Re1 Qc4+ 22. Kg2 Be5 22. Qd3 Qb4 24. f4 Bxc3 25. Qxc3 Qxc3 26. bxc3 gives me a weaker position.   Maybe so, but I did not like trading down the Rooks quite yet with 17...Nxg4 18. hxg4 Rxe1+ 19. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 20. Kxe1 Qxb2 21. Qd3 (best??) Bb4 22. Bd2 Bxc3 23. Bxc3 Qxa2  24. Ke2 Nf6.  Yes, I gobble up those Pawns, but the position is still far too dynamic with Queens all around.} 18. Rxe6 Rxe6 19. Nxf6+ Nxf6 20. Qd3 Qe5 {20....Qe5.  Once again the computer dislikes my choice, this time because 21. f4 Qe3 22. Qxe3 Rxe3 23. Bxf6 gxf6 24. Kf2 d4 25. Rd1 dxc3 26. Kxe3 cxb2.   But at this point I still have that Pawn advantage and hope to capitalize.   } 21. Bd2 Qh5 {21...Qh5.  If 22. h4 Qg4 23. Kg1 (forced, as ...Qh3 creates a lot of damage for White) Ne4 looking very strong, with a Pawn breakthrough coming at either g3 or f2, or ...Rg6 or ...Rh6.} 22. Kg2 Ne4 23. Nxe4 dxe4 24. Qd4 c5 {24...c5.  I had some doubts about this.  But it seemed superficially OK: (a) 25. Qc4? Qf3 26. Kg1 Rf6 27. Be3 Bxg3!; or (b) 25. Qa4 Qf3 26. Kg1 Bxg3 27. Be3 h6 28. Re1 Be5, followed by ...Rg6, ...Bh2, and ...Rh1++; (c) 25. Qc3 Qd5 26.  Be3 f5 (!?) 27. Qb3(?) c4! and ...f4!; or (d) Qe3 which is unclear, but I was planning ...Qd5, then ...f5, etc.} 25. Qe3 Qd5 {25....Qd5.  This a8-h1 diagonal, and the Queen safely placed upon it, is a constant concern to White after this.  Anything that unblocks the Black Pawn at e4 will be a gift for Black to launch an X-ray attack along that diagonal.} 26. b3 f5 27. c4 Qc6 28. Re1 Be5 {28...Be5.  If he plays 29. Bc3!?, then 29...f4! 30. Qxe4 (or if 30. gxf Bxc3 nets the Bishop, since 31. Qxc3 e3+ 32. f3 Rg6, etc) Bxc3 also nets the Bishop.} 29. Kg1 Bd4 30. Qf4 Rg6 31. Re2 h6 32. Qxf5 {32. Be3 was presumably the best, but I understand he wanted to equalize and then salvage what he could by a properly timed Qd5+ forcing the trade of Queens.  As it turns out, that choice saddles him with what will be a bleak endgame. } Rxg3+ 33. Kh2 {33. Kf1 was probably better, but 33....e3 looks ruinous to him, with that a8-h1 diagonal finally open to Black, causing a lot of misery to the King.  } Rf3 34. Qd5+ Qxd5 35. cxd5 Rxf2+ 36. Rxf2 Bxf2 37. d6 Kf7 38. Kg2 Bh4 {38...Bh4.  This temporarily seals the White King in his corner, and gives Black plenty of time to nab the passer, and also protect his own passer.}
