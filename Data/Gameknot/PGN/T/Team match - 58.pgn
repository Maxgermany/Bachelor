[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 {The Nimovitz is educational because it shows how fierce openings can be.  It is an irregular opening which people can frown upon, but the problem still remain that I had in my second game.  I've been losing it when we get into territory that I wasn't used to.  This on top of other things was why I got some needed training from the lord since in situations I was more like the turtose, as opposed to, the hair.  Ken saw this when I blundered a piece in our second game.  Problems then happened in the recent team match even earlier.  I wasn't used to what the opening became, and therefore, wasn't patience.  That resulted in losing a piece even earlier, in which I was very lucky to get off with a draw.  But, I agree with ION as the only reason that I offered it was because I didn't see how he could win.  However, there were opportunities, so it probably would've been better to decline the offer.  The same thing happened with Ted.  Where after having had won a piece in the Ruy Lopez, we got into unfamiliar territory.  I made a terrible blunder that should've given Ted the advantage.  Best play would put me the equivalent to a piece and pawn behind with advantage to him.  But, once he missed the opportunity and grabbed my R, immediately, it was mate.  From that, I realize that in situations you're not used, one must take even more time and do more calculation on what to do next.  But, Ken is very good at this as the move played shows.  This is why he can invent different variations which I find to be important for learning purposes, as for me, we're, once again, in unfamiliar territory.} e5 {Advancing the center pawn, but not to my surprise, Ken completes his fianchetto, as that's one of the lines he invented here.} 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 {Although they're equal, I favor Ken's position ever so slightly because his Bf1 is now mobile, as we're about to see.} Nf6 4. Bb5 d6 {My guess is that Rotterdam did this for a pawn chain.  But, I would not have imposed the pin, as black.  This is one way that I need work because I don't like pins.  So, my thing was always to break the pin.  In this position, it was 4...Bd7 only because Jack Stockel said that, in general, you want break the pin with the Bishop.  During my second training game with Ken, he said that I needed to give more thought then just what I was told.  The big problem is that I failed to do that, until I made that terrible blunder in the team game, with which, I got that lucky, when the reality is that I should've been lost.} 5. d4 {After breaking open the center, Rotterdam decides to exchange.  But, I ask the same question that Ken once told me to ask myself.  Do, I get any benefits.  In this case, I would've thought no as my only logic to do this would be just exchange.  Therefore, I would not have played this because I don't see anything else.  Instead, I would've played 5...d5 to stop 6.d5 at once since after the exchange, that threat is still there.} exd4 6. Qxd4 Bd7 {Not to my surprise, Rotterdam breaks the pin.  As before, I don't what white gets from exchanging, so I would've refused.  But, there's got to be benefit that I don't know about since Ken is going to do this.} 7. Bxc6 Bxc6 8. Nf3 {My guess is gain of tempo since uses the time to develop another piece.} a5 {Advancing on the flank.  It is obvious to me that Rotterdam is trying to get a semi open file since this is why TA has advanced his flank like this, during his some of his blitz Q sac games.} 9. a4 {But, Ken is just as determined to prevent that.} Be7 {Completing his development. and preparing to castle.} 10. Nc3 {Similarly, Ken also completes his development.} O-O 11. Rd1 {Centralizing his Rook behind the Queen.} Qd7 {Mobilizing his Queen.} 12. O-O {Not surprisingly, Ken also castles which allows Rotterdam to exchange.  This time, I do the point since Ken's pawn structures will be messed up around the K.  Jack Stockel has told me that this is generally what you don't want to happen.  So, it gets interesting here.} Bxf3 13. gxf3 c6 {Trying to get a pawn chain.} 14. Qf4 {But, Ken braces himself for the sac that is bound to come.} d5 {And, Rotterdam has a solid pawn chain as noted on his last move.} 15. Kh1 {This fixes some of the problems with the pawn structures.  As in one game, Jack Stockel also told me that after castling, bringing your King to the corner is an important part of K safety.} Bd6 {Bringing his Bishop to a more mobile by attacking it.  But, Ken is willing to give it up, and I see why.  As now, Rotterdam's weakest pawn is going to be removed which is going to leave his monarch King in trouble.  As noted in my last annotation, the f2 and f7 squares are critical.} 16. Qxf6 gxf6 17. Nxd5 {This move doesn't surprise at all.  Ken is willing to give up his N, for if Rotterdam takes it, white has 18.Bxf6!, followed by 19.Rg1# which will be mate.} Kg7 {So, Rotterdam is forced to defend which allow Ken the weakness even more with his next move.} 18. Nxf6 Qf5 {Trying to prevent more damage, Rotterdam uses his Queen as a shield.  But, Ken can still cause further, as is about to happen next.  } 19. Rfg1+ Kh8 {In the aftermath, Ken will win back a piece for a pawn, as well.} 20. Rxd6 Qxf3+ 21. Rg2 {With no where to go, Ken interposes with the Rook.  But, it doesn't matter because he is in much better shape.  But, Rotterdam's next move takes me by surprise.  As, I would not have given my Queen since there is no immediate if he is to leave it as it is, at least, to my perspective.  With that, I'm sure that there' something I'm missing.  So, the next move must be forced which allows Ken to get back the material he lost, and then some.} Qxg2+ 22. Kxg2 Rfd8 {Centralizing his Rook and preparing to exchange.  In this position, I would've allowed it.  But, the only reason behind exchanging is due to being ahead.  However, Ken sees it from a different perspective and refuses the liquidation, somewhat similar to when he refused the exchange with me which became the important first lesson.  He does this with the upcoming discover check. The difference is that in our first game it started off even, but here, black is ahead.  Which means that the refusal of exchanging had to do with mobility.  If that's so, I still need to work on that.} 23. Nd7+ Kg8 24. Bf6 {And, in doing, similar to our first game, Ken increases the pressure against Rotterdam.} Rde8 25. Rd4 {In the process, Ken increases the pressure even more by threatening a mating net with 26.Rg4#} h5 {Which Rotterdam stops.} 26. Rh4 {But, pressure around the K keeps increasing.  As now, he is still threatening mate with 27.Rxh5, followed by, 28.Rh8#} Kh7 {So, Rotterdam puts a stop to that, as well.  However, Ken has answers to that move, as well.} 27. Rxh5+ Kg6 28. Rg5+ Kh6 29. Kf3 {Now, that we're in the endgame, Ken uses his monarch as a weapon.} Reg8 {Interestingly enough, Rotterdam is willing to liquidate.} 30. Rf5 {But, Ken's refusal to do so makes sense to me here because he needs that Rook.  That is, especially if he is to threaten mate again because without the Rook it will be that much more difficult to do that.} Kh7 {Seeing how it all goes down, Rotterdam is trying to avoid even more trouble.} 31. Rh5+ {But, it's too little too late as his next move is forced.} Kg6 32. Kg4 {After getting the opposition, Rotterdam resigns.  Black's next move was going to be 32...Rad8 since Ken mentioned it.  But, then comes 33.Rg5+, after which, it's over.  As black will not be able to avoid mate.  Overall, I really enjoyed this game because this is another example of how intense openings can be and what can happen, if you're unprepared for unusual openings like this.  And, it shows how the important the f2 and f7 squares.}
