1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's Defense.An interesting chioce by this expert because you don't see it too often, but I've been working with variations of this for years. The immediate problem for Black is the f8 bishop.} 3. Bc4 {Bc4?!  d4 is better.} Be6 {Be6? Putting it to my king bishop right away in a very risky manner.} 4. Bxe6 fxe6 {I considered Bb3 but giving him this weakness without compensation or development this early can't be passed up. An immediate king-side attack is necessary now. In Bernstein vs Tartakover,1937, Black had a similar idea but developed his pieces a bit more and planned it out: e4...e5,Nf3...d6,d4...Nf6,PxP...NxP,Bc4...Be6,BxB...PxB,Qe2...d4,Qb5?...Nc6!,Nd4...Qd7, QxNP?...Bb4+! It's all over in a few more moves with a double rook sacrifice by Black and an unstoppable mate threat.} 5. d4 exd4 6. Nxd4 Nf6 7. Qd3 Qc8 8. Nc3 e5 9. Nf5 {Nf5!} g6 10. Bg5 Nxe4 11. Nxe4 {With a weakened king side and poor developement, Black tries a counter-attack.} gxf5 12. Nf6+ Kf7 {This position was set in motion by 3...Be6. } 13. Qc4+ Kg6 14. Qh4 {Attacking two pieces but..Qh4!} h5 15. Nd5 Na6 16. Bf6 Rh6 17. O-O-O Qe6 18. Rhe1 Kf7 19. Bg5 {Now with all the pieces on good squares, and the Black king and Queen at risk, it's time to move in.} Rh7 20. f4 e4 21. g4 Bg7 22. gxf5 Qxf5 23. Bd8 Qe6 {With three pieces more or less out of play, Black can't defend this position for long.} 24. Reg1 c6 25. f5 {f5! Still down material, I have only one way--continued pressure.} Qd7 26. Rxg7+ {Rxg7! and Black resigned. With mate threats and the loss of a Queen coming up , there was no point in taking the rook.} Rxg7 27. Qxh5+ Kf8 28. f6 cxd5 29. fxg7+ Qxg7 30. Rf1+ Kg8 31. Qxd5+ Kh7 32. Rf7 {He could have tried this line but chose not to see it demonstrated over the board.}
