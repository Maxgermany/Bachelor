[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 d6 {In the moment I play the pirc defense with black} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {untill now, standard moves} 4. f3 {4.f4, austran attack is more agressive but this is a common answer} Bg7 5. Be3 {good move, protecting d4 and preparing a bayonnet attack toward the fianchetoed bishop (further Qd2 and Bh6)} c6 {preparing a pawn advance on the queenside} 6. Qd2 {Ready for the bayonnet attack} Qa5 {Common move in the pirc to prevent 7.e5 and prepare an attack on the queenside} 7. O-O-O {White castles a bit too soon, I think.} b5 {In the pirc, black often attacks the queenside} 8. Kb1 {To prevent 8. ... b4 9. Ne2Qxa2} Nbd7 {Developing and preparing a further c5} 9. Nce2 {Retreating, probably a strategical mistake, for it weakens white's queenside} b4 {Black advances toward the white king} 10. c4 {White probably hopes for that black will take en passant... GK computer points it as a inacuracy, prefering Nf4} c5 {But the back b pawn is dangerous for white and I do not want to trade it.} 11. dxc5 Nxc5 {Aiming at b3. Now white can hardly send pieces toward black's kinside, for there is need to protect the king...} 12. Nc1 {... so that white sends his knight to protect b3 and open the diagonal, so that his LSB protects the c pawn} O-O {Black will need the two rooks for his attack.} 13. Nge2 {Developping} Bd7 {aiming at a4 to menace b3 and joining the rooks} 14. Bxc5 {White wants to reduce the pression on his left wing but I think it's a strategical mistake, for black will, from now on, have full control on the black squares.} Qxc5 {Making space for a pawn advance on a5} 15. b3 {protecting c4, preventing the black pawn to come on b3 but opening the a1 h8 diagonal for black's fianchetoed DSB} a5 {Now, the b pawn is safe and a further a4 is possible} 16. Nd3 {The black queen has to leave} Qc7 {the queen has to stay on the c file, for a black rook will occupy the b file.} 17. Nec1 {knight on protection} Rfb8 {Bringing artillery in front of the castle wall} 18. g4 {White tries to create some countergame but 18.e5 would have been better, creating a more immediate threat.} a4 {I estimate that it was impossible for black to improve his position and I didn't want white to counterattack so that it's time to launch the attack.} 19. Nxb4 {I had the impression that it was a good move but GK computer considers it as a mistake : 19. e5 would have been better, forcing black to defend.} axb3 {I'll bother with the knight further, the most important is to break the castle walls.} 20. axb3 Nxe4 {Knight sacrifice to open the big diagonal for the black DSB} 21. fxe4 {White has little other choice} Ra1+ {investing the castle} 22. Kc2 {Forced move} Qa5 {Menacing both b4 and a2} 23. Ncd3 {Good defense, black looses a piece or stop his attack} Ra2+ {Exchanging a rook against a knight} 24. Nxa2 {Only move to save the queen} Qxa2+ {Black is now far in late of material but the position compensates} 25. Kc1 Qa3+ {This move is a mistake, according to GK computer, ther was a quicker mate (25. ... Bh6) but this semmed safer. White submits here, for the only way to avoid mate in 3 is to sacrifice the queen.}
