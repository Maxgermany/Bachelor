[Opening "Giuoco Piano (C50), four knights variation"]

1. e4 {The Cheeky One.  This was fun... well from my point of view anyway.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Standard Ruy Lopez... as per.} Bc5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. d3 Ng4 {Neatly reversed...} 6. O-O Nxf2 7. Rxf2 Bxf2+ 8. Kxf2 Nd4 9. Nxe5 {Ever an optimist, looking at bxp and then bringing the other knight in to harass. Forgetting one small thing however....} Qf6+ {Which is black is trying his best to stop me.} 10. Nf3 d6 11. Bg5 Qg6 12. Be3 Nxf3 13. Qxf3 O-O 14. Nd5 {This is the move which starts it all off. Looking at k-e7 for obvious reasons, but also with an eye on c7, the less obvious target.} Kh8 15. Nxc7 {He defended the logical one, so I'll have the pawn.} Bg4 16. Qg3 Rad8 {That seemed a bit of a negative move to my eyes. Might have gone to c8 instead.} 17. Nd5 f5 {Thought about a couple of options here. First was pushing the pawn but that left me vulnerable to f4, then I thought of ignoring the threat and attacking, but that seemed foolish, so in the end I took as it seemed the safest option.} 18. exf5 Qxf5+ 19. Kg1 a6 {Another rather negative move imho. With his forces all out in the open I was expecting a more aggressive move.} 20. Nf4 {Looking at the e6 spot to fork the rooks.} Bh5 {Not sure why he did that one.} 21. Ne6 Rde8 {And I was just about to take the rook when I noticed summat. Pure luck, but all of his pieces were just in the right position... or the wrong position depending on your point of view....} 22. Qxg7# {A queen, two rooks and a bishop all out in the open and not a single one can intervene. Most of mine go 50 moves plus, so this was a very pleasing win.}
