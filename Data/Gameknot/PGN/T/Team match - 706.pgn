1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nxd4 Bc5 5. Be3 Qe7 6. Nf5 {Inviting an early insane position in the opening.  Should be a lesson to not follow the DB blindly I did not come out well in this...} Qxe4 7. Nxg7+ Kf8 8. Nd2 Qe5 9. Nf3 {Gains a temp for now but I am stuck with a peice under attack and no way to protect it or move it because I let the opponent get center control while i went pawn picking away from the action} Bb4+ 10. c3 Bxc3+ {...a clever sacrafice by black} 11. bxc3 Qxc3+ 12. Bd2 Qxg7 {now down 2 in material with enough develop edge to make up for it} 13. Bb5 Nge7 14. Rc1 d5 15. Qe2 Bg4 16. h3 Nd4 17. Qd3 Nxf3+ {Although I get doubled pawns I was happy to create the open file at his queen and on his king side because I'm losing and need to make something happen} 18. gxf3 Bf5 19. Qa3 c6 {blocking off my bishops claim in e8} 20. Ba4 Qg2 {I thought this move was blacks 1st error because hes forcing me to make a move i want to make anyway..} 21. Ke2 {Rcg1 threat wins the queen so black needs to move it now again, making move 20 a waste} Qg6 22. Rcg1 {and now a 3rd time} Qe6+ 23. Kd1 Re8 24. Bg5 {Forced the queen to stay on the 6-row or else mate and now there are 2 peices attacking the pinned knight and there is about to be 3 with Re1 which will also forced the queen off the e file and black will lose a defender} f6 {This move is poor because it gives me a forced mate though I'm really not sure what Black's best option was} 25. Bh6+ Kf7 26. Rg7+ Kf8 27. Rxe7+ {}
