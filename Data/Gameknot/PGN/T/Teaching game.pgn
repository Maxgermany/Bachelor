[Opening "Two knights defence (C55)"]

1. e4 {Allow me to give some background information for those that aren't in the team and as a result don't know how these teaching games usually work. The first 2 moves were already decided before the game started since it presumably shows the strengths and weaknesses of a player rather well. However I highly doubted that this was going to end well for me. I, who usually prides himself on having a high theoretical knowledge about openings, have 0 knowledge when it comes to 1.e4 e5. and thus if peta forces a theoretical variation of something, I'd probably lose. Or if he plays some dubious line that doesn't work given that white plays exactly 3 or 4 correct moves then I already know I won't find those 3/4 moves and lose as a result. You can say in a way that he went easy on me. The last time I played 1. e4 in a serious match was about 7 years ago when I was 12. I think that says enough about my inexperience with the opening. I tried different things back then and after my first win with 1.d4 I never bothered to play anything else. It'll be an unfamiliar, but interesting experience to say the least.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Of the many openings i could have chosen for I chose the Italian opening. The reason is simple. Every other opening I know of has too much theory behind it. For example: In the Ruy Lopez there's sidelines of sidelines of sidelines. Some superGM's probably even analysed this opening all the way up to move 30. Getting caught up in such an opening when I have no knowledge about it isn't advisable. The Italian does have some tricks behind it in terms of d4 pushes and Ng5 moves, but for the most part it's supposedly pretty straightforward.} Nf6 {Immediately putting on the pressure. White has ideas here of Ng5, but that's where the theoretical part starts. I think that would mean we'd be playing the fried liver attack, an opening which I'm not too fond of. I didn't bother to read too much about it, but I imagine it'd be met with 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nc3 h6. or something of the sorts. An alternate solution and what I believe is the main variation is 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Na5 which is just asking for trouble. That opening is so completely different from how I usually play, I didn't dare go into it. I think in some theoretical lines black could even allow Nxf7 giving up the rook since white wastes a lot of time capturing. } 4. Nc3 {Defending the pawn on e4, there's little more to it. It's not exactly the most manly move, but then again chess isn't really a game/sport which strikes people as super manly in the first place.} Bc5 {Targeting the weak f2 pawn. Black has ideas of Ng4, but O-O solves those issues.} 5. d3 {Preparing to get my bishop into play. However I had no clue whereto. Usually I either develop it to d2 or g5 in a queens gambit, but since we're playing something different here... Looking back at it, I should have developed to e3, much like what Bigpeta will play in the near future.} d6 {The position is far too symmetrical for my taste, I quite frankly have no clue what the ideas behind this position are or how either side will progress apart from basic development. I guess something along the lines of developing -> castling -> play d4 or f4 as breaking moves somewhere in the future.} 6. h3 {Preventing the knight/light squared bishop to come to g4 and pin the knight on f3. I considered Bg5, but after 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 g5 it feels a little cramped for white, black can still perfectly fine castle queen side if he wants to so he can play g5 in my opinion. Still pondering where my dark squared bishop is going to end up.} Be6 {Suddenly I realize that e3 is also an option for my own bishop. My apologies for stealing the idea Bigpeta.} 7. Bxe6 {I didn't see a good square for my bishop to go to so I opt to trade. A mistake perhaps? Well at most it's a slight error, not something game losing. It creates a double pawn, but I don't think it's really a troubling pawn for black. It'll make ideas of d5 a lot easier in the future to break open the position. Black will probably castle king side next to use the open file. According to Bigpeta Bb3 was the heavy favorite according to gameknot databases. I looked at these databases before opting for Bxe6, but found that while Bb3 wins 3% more games, i consider 3% not relevant enough to take Bxe6 out of consideration. The problem with Bb3 is that the threat doesn't disappear, in the end an exchange will take place as I find it pretty inevitable. I also don't have much experience with bishops on this particular square which also influenced my decision.} fxe6 {Black is up a tempo, which white should be able to get back via playing Be3.} 8. Be3 {Winning back the tempo and resuming basic development. } Bxe3 {I was expecting Bb6 considering he asked me why I didn't play the similar Bb3. If i had to take a guess, maybe these type of positions are more suited to his preferences or he intended to keep the position pretty symmetrical to further test me.} 9. fxe3 {Regaining material. The position is nearly symmetrical, but I got h3 in somewhere. Not sure how much that little nuance will matter though.} Qe7 {Well we reached the point where the database stops for free users, and kind of the point where I'll start to get clueless about the position. Qe7 was played with the idea of maybe playing either d5 and create a diagonal for the queen to attack on. Most likely this'll be done after I castle. Castling king side doesn't really look very safe anymore so that's no longer a candidate move for the time being. Maybe it's time to fix the double pawn with the likes of d4, but black isn't obligated to take it and probably won't. It's something I should keep in mind for the future though. I don't dislike the plan of Qe2 with the same idea that I figure black is following.} 10. Qe2 {My reason for playing Qe2 is explained in the previous move. However on top of that it's also good to note that Qe2 also defends g2, which is arguably White's most vulnerable pawn in this position.} O-O-O {Bringing king into safety and looking for the d5 push. } 11. d4 {I calculated O-O, O-O-O and d4. O-O although interesting, since it gives the possibility of a queen side pawn storm, felt like putting my king into too much danger. A move like Nh5, targeting the g3 square, was something I was very concerned about. O-O-O is very similar, but grants more king safety at the cost of less attacking possibilities. That being said, I calculate the following sequence. 11. O-O-O d5 12.exd5 exd5 13. Rad1 Rhf8. In that variation the only big difference is that black has more space and thus more likely will be the aggressor. Something I'd rather not allow. Therefore I played d4 with which I try to gain space before black has the opportunity to do so. Black has a variety of ways to deal with this issue. I calculated 11. d4 Rhf8 12. O-O-O d5. Another possibility on move 12 is exd4, but it leaves black slightly more cramped. d5 is a response in which white has to capture rather carefully. Capturing in a wrong move order might leave him a pawn down.} d5 {The dreaded d5 push. I'm glad I played d4 before d5 was played since it allows me to decide how we're going to trade.} 12. exd5 {I made this move since dxe5 becomes troublesome if black plays 1/2 exact variations, which I'm sure my opponent would find. If dxe5 then follows Nxe4 Nxe4 dxe4 and the isolated e-pawns are too difficult to defend. exd might cause me to get an isolated e-pawn, but I'm pretty sure it's not that easy for black to take advantage of. I can probably find the time to castle somewhere along the way.} Nxd5 13. Nxd5 exd5 14. dxe5 Nxe5 {14 moves and you can almost say we're in an endgame. Not the typical stuff you'd see in a d4 opening. That being said, I asses the position to be better for black, but not in such a manner that I'm going to sit in a corner and cry about it. 14. dxe5 Nxe5 15.O-O-O is what I guessed would happen during these moves at first as it seems most logical. A possible continuation could be for example 15. Nc4 ( preparing for moves such as Qb4 ) 16. e4 dxe4 ( pushing loses material, if ignored I could play Rh1e1 and with that prepare to take ). 17. Qxc4 exf3 18. Qg4+ 19.Qd7 Qxf3. Of course the variation alters slightly depending on how black plays, but I don't see any issues here.} 15. Nxe5 {Although I a first planned on O-O-O this accelerates things into an endgame. I calculate the following sequence: 15. Nxe5 Qxe5 16. O-O-O with a very even position. The position is slightly better for black, but it seems very drawish. I can't see of any good way for either side to really gain an edge here. g2 is slightly weaker than g7 and black has slightly more space in the center, but that's the only issues that white is facing.} Qxe5 16. O-O-O {The predicted sequence of moves. The score is probably -0.30 according to computers considering how they value space advantage ( I haven't actually checked this, it's an estimate ). I think an eventual pawn push to d4 is something I have to be wary of, but not at the moment because I do still have a check with Qg4, which would also target the d4 square, thus not losing any material. I'm not sure if black has enough time to move his king out of the way and then play d4.} Rhe8 {Aiming for the e3 pawn. A simple, but effective plan which makes d4 a possibility in the future. Let's say white makes a hypothetical Rh1f1 move. Then a possible sequence could be 17. Rh1f1 d4 18. Qg4+ Kb8 19. Rxd4 Qxe3+. Material will still be even, but I'd be lying if I said that the queen on e3 wouldn't be annoying. Of course there are other variations there, but you catch the drift. It's about time for white to think this trough. What type of endgame do I want to reach and how do I reach it. What type of endgame gives me the best chances for a positive result?} 17. Rhf1 { made this move hypothetically in my mind last move and found out that it didn't really work. I left my ongoing games for a few days to go do some other stuff, came back, stared at this board and suddenly realised that the only idea why my idea didn't really work that well was because i assumed Qg4+ is into this somehow. However it hit me that this might not be the case. This is something which is said on a regular basis to me, I usually find the right move in a position and then write it off as a possibility for an inferior alternative. Rh1f1 is played under the assumption that defending e3 in the near future will prove too difficult. Therefore I'm willing to let it go if I get the right sort of compensation or can regain the pawn somehow. I calculate: 17. Rh1f1 Qxe3 18. Qxe3 Rxe3 19.Rf7 after which black can't defend both the d5 and g7 pawn so one will most definitely fall. Black doesn't have to take on e3, however I do think it's arguably the move that keeps the most pressure on the position.} Rd7 {I report my thinking behind every move to bigpeta as it helps him understand my thought process, which leads to more efficient teaching. He agreed on my idea that after 17. Rh1f1 Qxe3 18. Qxe3 Rxe3 19. Rf7 the position is equal. He plays Rd7 to undermine this idea. I hadn't actually considered this move, but it seems strong. Maybe even slightly stronger then my anticipated response. At this point I'm not sure what my reply is going to be, especially since endgames are my Achilles heel so to speak. I notice that his rook and king are nicely lined up, so ideas of Qg4 pop up, but that forfeits the pawn on e3. I'm not sure I want to defend e3 with a rook though, since it feels like black would just simply line up his pieces and eventually go for it.} 18. Kb1 {I find this move. It doesn't do much except get my king out of the c1-h5 diagonal which could complicate things. This looks like it loses a pawn, but it actually doesn't after 18. Kb1 Qxe3 19. Qxe3 Rxe3 20. Rf8+ Rd8 21. Rxd8 Kxd8 22. Rxd5 regaining the pawn. Black's king will be more centralized/active, and the g2 pawn is a reason for slight concern, but I think white can probably draw this given correct play. That being said, I had the bad premonition that bigpeta wouldn't go for that variation. He's sure to analyze the most out of my weaker endgame skills, that much I'm sure of.} b6 {As GM Ben Finegold would say in some of his youtube videos: Make Luft not war. This move does exactly that, it creates a flight square for the king and prepares c5 and a5 ideas. There's little White can do to prevent it.} 19. Rd3 {This move defends e3. I'm pretty sure there must be some better, more challenging move out there, but I can't find it. I guess the plan for white and black here is to move the pawns on the queenside of the board. The anticipated response is c5.} Kb7 {Moving his king out of the diagonal, making it slightly more active by giving it the possibility to move to c6 and possibly preparing c5. } 20. Qd2 {I can't just turtle up all game, this puts the pawn on d5 under pressure while still keeping 2 defenders on my e3 pawn.} Qe6 {Protecting the rook in case of e4 or c4 ideas I suppose.} 21. c4 {I think c4 is needed to get some progress here. dxc4 obviously loses material. Putting the queen on the b1-h7 diagonal is something i can just move out of. and pushing probably gets met by exd4 Qxc4. After which white may have an isolated pawn, but it's very difficult to take advantage of since there are no pawn majorities on either side. c6 is also a possible move, which is what I'm anticipating to be played by peta. I think I'll just capture on d4 if that move were to be played.} d4 {Probably the best response for reasons which I already stated in the previous move.} 22. Rxd4 {I didn't consider this at first as I was only looking at exd4 Qxc4, but it hit me that there might be something better for white here. Black can't play something like 22. ... Qxe3 because it gets met by 23. Qxe3 Rxe3 24. Rxd7. The variation which I anticipated is 22. Rxd4 Rxd4 23. Qxd4 Qxe3 ( winning back the pawn ) 24. Qxe3 Rxe3. After that Black's rook is more active, but after for example 25. Rf2 it doesn't look bad for white. A b3 move can follow to defend c4 if he were to aim for it.} Rxd4 23. Qxd4 {Better was exd4 because of Qg6 which I missed. I hate to admit it, but my calculation skills go downhill as there are less and less pieces on the board. It comes from my lack of endgame studies. It's why I usually try and end a game before it reaches the endgame.} Qg6+ {I missed this variation. I actually looked at this, but didn't notice that the g2 pawn is hanging. Kc1 Qxg2 equalizes the pawns, but what does white play after that to defend both the e3 and the h3 pawn? It looks like I may have messed up. There's still Rf7 after Qg2 which gives some play, but I'm pretty sure White's going to play with a pawn down the rest of the game. Luckily 1 pawn can still lead to a draw in this day and age granted that the correct circumstances are met. } 24. Kc1 {Better then Ka1 in my opinion. After Qxg2 my rook is targeted and I'd like to move it to f7. If my king is on a1 then that's impossible because of Qh1+ which leads to a forced checkmate in 2 after 25. ... Qh1+ 26. Rf1 Qxf1 . 27. Qd1 Qxd1++} Qxg2 25. Rf7 {If the pawn on h3 is to fall then I can temporarily equalise the material. Checks along the lines of Qd5+ can also quickly escalate if he were to play carelessly.} Qxh3 26. Rxg7 {Capturing material. He can win the pawn on e3, however doing so isn't easy. Rxe3 gets met with Qd5+. After that black can only go to the 8th rank after which I can play Rg8+ In the best case it's checkmate, in the worst case he loses his queen for my rook. If the pawn on e3 falls because of Qxe3+ then after trading queens i can capture on h3 to equalize material. He can put my king in check a few times, but it can easily escape and defend my 3 pawns leading to a more or less equal endgame again. Because of the variations I just mentioned, capturing the pawn on e3 currently isn't very appealing. That being said, Black's position is still favorable.} h5 {The best move for as far as I can see it. Not only does it push his pawn 2 steps closer to promotion, but now I also have to watch out for Qxe3 winning a pawn. Since the following would be forced: 27. Qxe3 Qxe3 28.Rxe3 after which he's a clear pawn ahead. Rxe3 is still not an option because of 27.Qd5+ 28. Kb8 Rg8. I'm not quite sure what to play here as Qxe3 should follow no matter what white plays here. I considered 27. Qd5+ Kb8 28. Rg8, pinning his rook. In the case of Rxg8 I could play Qxg8 in the hope to draw by repetition, but I realised that a6 is also a flight square for black, which isn't a place my queen could reach. A draw by repetition would be impossible.} 27. Rh7 {The pawn on e3 is lost, however with Rh7 i prepare to equalise material once more.} Qg3 {Preparing Qe1+.} 28. Rxh5 {Winning back the material I'll eventually end up losing. This is where the complications start though and as such, this is a bad move. White could have delayed this.} Qe1+ {Kc2 leads to Qe2+, winning the rook. Therefore my only option is Qd1. Maybe getting my rook on that diagonal was his intention all along and why he didn't mind me taking it.} 29. Qd1 Qxe3+ {Defending with Qd2 means he'll play Qg1+ with the aim of getting to the g6 square and maybe fork king and rook. That of course implies that I'm going to be playing Kc2, but it's not that simple. 30. Qd2 Qg1+ 31.Qd1 Re1! winning my queen for his rook. I start calculating whether or not I can move my king to maybe get out of the nasty future skewer and or pin.} 30. Kb1 {I didn't like what I found, white loses the c4 pawn no matter what. There's still quite a few pieces on the board though, a draw is definitely still possible. The only thing I need to do is somehow trade all of the pieces so he only has 1 pawn left. If my king in that case is at the correct square, it's a theoretical drawn endgame. I barely ever study endgames, but the one I've spent most time on is king and pawn versus king and how to draw that.} Qe4+ {Winning the c4 pawn.} 31. Ka1 Qxc4 {He's a clear pawn up. White can still draw given correct play and that's what I decide to be aiming for. If I'm too ambitious and try and force something it'll weaken my kingside and I'll probably get the short end of the stick. Remember several moves ago when I said I can't turtle up all game? Well, time to become a tortoise instead then.} 32. a3 {Creating a flightsquare for the future. Currently it's not of much use with his queen on c4, but unless he somehow gets his rook on the first rank, it won't be much of a problem. This move was actually on recommendation by peta, I didn't come up with it myself, though it makes a lot of sense when I thought about it afterwards. I hadn't thought much about the position yet at that point as I was resolving real life stuff. I may or may not have found this move if I had thought about it before peta recommended it. Nobody will ever know.} a5 {Preparing moves such as b5, c5, etc. Pretty straightforward moves to try and crash through my pawnstructure and maybe somewhere get a winning position. I think this game can, given proper play, still go to a draw, but it's easy to slip up. I'll have to play very accurately.} 33. Rh1 {Not neccecarily, but probably only the 3th best move. Best was either Qd5+ which I missed, but saw a move afterwards, which forces the trade of queens. After that black is still a pawn up, but his ability to catch me offguard somewhere and force a win is a lot less. The second best move was noticed by peta a move later. Qh1+, giving check to the Black king. Problem was that I couldn't see a good follow-up after Kb8. Maybe Rh7 after that, pressuring c7 and preventing the king of going where he wants to. Qd5 is better if you're playing for a draw, Qh1 is better if you're somehow still playing for a win with white, which is ambitious but I guess somehow still possible. The idea behind Rh1 was to defend any Rf8 -> Rf1 ideas. After Rh1, I'd be able to move my queen around freely without having to fear pins or backrank checkmates.} Re2 {Pressuring b2. It's not too much of a threat, but white has to be careful at all times.} 34. Re1 {Offering the trade. if he trades then a draw becomes significantly easier, if he doesn't then at least my rook is slightly better. I anticipated Rf2 here, keeping the pressure on b2 and preventing Rf1 or Re2 ideas. Maybe he can also play Rc2, but I think that's drawish if I play a waitinf move like Rg1.} Rf2 {Staying on the 2nd rank. Notice that Rf1 or Re2 aren't possible anymore because of his queen, so I can't force a draw or trade from this position.} 35. Rh1 {Moving further away from Black's pieces. There's little White can do to improve his position, all he can do is move his pieces around, protect a few key squares and put up a tight guard. This is also probably where I start to nag in chat ( as I'm a bit of a sore loser ) about not being able to improve my position.} a4 36. Re1 Ka6 {Moving out of possible checks. Black has all the time in the world so he might as well.} 37. Qd8 {Threatening 38. Qa8+ Kb5 39. Re5 c5 40.Qe8+ etc.} Kb7 {The easiest defence to my threat.} 38. Qd1 Rh2 39. Qf3+ Ka7 40. Qe3 Qb3 {Offering a trade of pieces. Normally this would be a good thing, but I'm not so sure if I want a pawn on b3 Note that I also can't capture the pawn on b3 if it gets there with Re3 because of Rh1+ Re1 Rxe1 checkmate. Having a pawn on b3 means permanently sealing of all escape squares. The only way to escape would be to move my king all the way around, which arguably costs too much time. Meanwhile black is going to march all his pawns down the board and when c3 is played and I take bxc3 it creates a passed b-pawn for Black} 41. Qd4 {Declining the trade and watching over b2 as there's a checkmate threat there.} Qc2 42. Rd1 Rf2 43. Rg1 Rd2 {Neither side can do a lot, but glare at each other and make empty threats. Let's play a hypothetical Qe5 followed by peta wanting to advance the c-pawn. 44. Qe5 c5 45. Qc7+ Ka6 46. Qc8 Ka7. would occur which is a draw by repetition. If you go to a5 I give a check on a8. if Black goes to b5 I go to e8. Black can escape with his king, but I'll be putting checks everywhere until he finally lines up his pieces with his king after which I give check and trade them of. Advancing the b-pawn has the same problem in that it makes your king more vulnerable to checks and it doesn't actually do anything. On top of all that you need to watch out for Black's a-pawn not falling somewhere along the line.As long as I don't place my pieces on a square where Black can trade positively and I keep the b2 pawn under protection Black can't progress. It is under the assumption that I won't blunder that a draw is offered. It was a pretty enjoyable game ( and frustrating at times ), but I'm pretty sure peta would wipe the floor with me were he to play his usual opening. My long term planning in a game definitely still needs work,  as well as my endgame skills. In this game I took several days per move in the endgame which I of course wouldn't get in an over the board game. I've been slowly improving myself in the areas I still lack in, but it'll still be a long road from here as this game confirmed the fact that I'm still lacking.}
