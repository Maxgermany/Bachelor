[Opening "Benko's opening (A00)"]

1. g3 {This unusual opening is not bad, but it provides clear clues to black about what will be black's formation, so I know that I have to play against pressure on the white diagonal. } d5 2. Bg2 e5 {Deviating from my usual developement (Bf5). } 3. d4 {This is not necessarily bad, but provides me with a blocking move.} e4 {White would attack my central chaing, pretty advanced, at the cost of piece developement. } 4. Be3 {? White wants to defend instead of attack, and this is not the right thing to do as white. This move makes the two bishops virtually useless, but white's dsb does makes pressure on c5. But I won't go for it!} c6 {I'll play "around" c5, "through" c5, but not "on" c5. } 5. Nc3 Qb6 {I can attack b2 provided I don't move my lsb from guarding b7.} 6. Na4 Qa5+ 7. c3 {The standard defence for white, almost forced. But I have the initiative already! White can now reject my queen, but moreover, he has an almost-free access to my kingside with the two bishops. I won't play 5, kicking the knight, that will land undisturbed on c5, x-ray protected, and I won't have any pawn to kick it. So I played...} Bd6 {...making c7 a solid safe square for my queen after b4. } 8. b4 {Obviously. I lost the initiative in order to develop my dsb and control Bf4 by white. } Qc7 {My queen is well placed, and if white insists in attacking the queenside. he will have not his lsb to support it. And as long as I keep the chance to play b6, c5 is under control. } 9. Nc5 b6 10. Nb3 {I reached my objective: white's dsb is blocked by his own pawns, and his pieces have poor action. White can think in a future c4, even sacrifying it, but now it is impossible because the knight f3 will be attacked. } Ba6 {This controls c4.} 11. f3 {White, finally, attacks my pawn's chain. } f5 {I can play this confidently, because of the passive position of white's pieces. I have to avoid white to unravel his pieces. } 12. f4 {White blocks the game, hoping in a long battle and to draw the endgame. I have to take my chances with my kingside pawns. I am not developed, but this is not so pressing since white is tied too. } g5 {So I planned to open the white position by sacrifying my dsb on g6. I saw this was the only way to avoid a long and boring game. But in chess, the lack of attack is often heavily punished, so probably this was "the best wasy" to go on. You should never let your opponent nothing to worry about, if you can avoid that!} 13. Nh3 {Good. Now I have to show an alternate plan. } g4 {I block the game myself. Exchanging pawns would have meant to solve whites developement's problem. } 14. Ng5 {Come, come in... you'll never came out of this. } h6 15. Ne6 {My pressure on the black squares is useless, now, so I don't mind to move my queen...} Qe7 {And now the knight has no escape route. White should have played Nf2 before. } 16. Nec5 {? White should have taken the tempo as a compensation for the piece, and play an aggressive move, like a4. } bxc5 17. dxc5 {Good. This opens some perspective for the white queen and the d column.} Bc7 {A loss of tempo, and a higly squeezed position, but hey, I won a piece, I have to expect some downside to it. } 18. O-O {? That provides me with another target! White should have played Qd4 or Nd4, in order to make my life more difficult. } h5 {Here it comes the new ninka assassin. } 19. Bd4 {Good, if your purpose is to play e3 and further block the game. But in order to do this, you must have another piece out of its place. Can you tell which one?} Nf6 {Why not. So I win developement, and this doesn't affect h4...} 20. e3 {! White reached its dream position... almost. But forgot two things. } Bxf1 {The first one. This, nevertheless, has the downside to abilitate the c4 threat by white. I have to remember this. } 21. Qxf1 h4 {I can't lose time with Nb-d7, because white now has c4. It won't be a dreadful move, since I have Nxd4. But this makes my attack on the white king to slow down. White would have exchanged an improvement on the queenside, while his king is still unthreatened on his shell... no way. } 22. b5 {This one is also a good move. This abilitates the WQ penetration to b5. I have to be careful handling that. } hxg3 {My plan is to press with the queen on h7, on h2. This will bring the king into a square from where Rh3 would prepare Qxg3. This was a flash. I can't lose time, or white will create problems and will block me. } 23. hxg3 Qh7 {Of course, this plan implied the loss of the Nf6, currently useless, but fundamental in a later stage of the attack on h5, aiming to g3. But if I lose time, white will take measures that can inhabilitate my attack, like Kc2. I can't lose a single tempo. Besides, I have a piece already, so...} 24. Bxf6 Qh2+ 25. Kf2 Rh3 {Now, what I didn't see (I'm a bad blitz player) is now, with Bh6, my attack would have been neutralized, and my attackers blocked, exchanged and all I had was a squeezed queenside. } 26. Ke2 {? White lost the chance to humilliate me!} Rxg3 {Now, white just falls. } 27. Kd2 Rxg2+ 28. Kc1 Rg1 29. Nd4 Rxf1# {As a 1200, you can beat me on blitzs. I play riskyfully and carelessly. But if you miss your chance... chess is cruel!}
