1. d4 {This is my first annotated game, please give me some constructive criticism.  I dislike Queen's pawn openings, I never feel as comfortable as I do with the e4.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 e6 {transposes into semi-slav} 4. Bf4 dxc4 5. e4 b5 6. Nf3 Nf6 7. Be2 Bb7 {I debated for a long time about this move... I thought about being aggressive with Qa5, but wasn't sure I liked the way the power would balance after 8. Nd2 Bb4.  } 8. O-O Be7 9. Be5 {I wasn't sure I liked this move, seemed premature.  Was expecting Qc2 or Re1.} Nbd7 10. Re1 c5 {In hindsight this wasn't a very good move and instead should have 0-0 or Nxe4.} 11. Nxb5 {And immediately I start to feel the pressure at c7.} Nxe5 12. Nxe5 {expected dxe5 instead.} O-O {Trying to save myself from any future knight forks at or around c7.} 13. f3 {I thought d5 which after some exchanges leads to Bxc4 leaves white in a better position.} cxd4 {missed a6 which would have been better forcing the retreat of the knight.} 14. Nxd4 {?? Better would have been Bxc4 or Nxc4} Bc5 {! pinning the knight to the king.} 15. Nxc4 Bxd4+ 16. Kf1 e5 {protecting the bishop allowing my queen to go roaming.  } 17. Qd3 Nh5 18. Rad1 {?? Whites best chances for life were g3 or Ne3.} Qh4 {White resigns.  Could have bought some time with Ne3 but the game is essentially lost.}
