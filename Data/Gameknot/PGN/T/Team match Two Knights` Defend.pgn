1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {Two Knights` Defence - probably would be correct to call this opening the Two Knights` Attack !!} 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Na5 {b5 - The Ulvestad Variation. Magnus Carlsen won this against Arkadi Naiditsch during the 37th Chess Olympiad 2006 } 6. Bb5+ {Little tested but interesting is Bd7 However i decided to carry on my usual move ...} c6 7. dxc6 bxc6 8. Be2 Bc5 {h6 is the main move. With this move Bc5 - according to database, this move scores miserably 17% !} 9. d3 O-O 10. Nc3 Bb4 {Nd5 is probably best. I decided to move Bb4 pinning the Knight to gain space on Queenside.} 11. O-O {Wise decision !} Re8 12. a3 {Seem my Bishop is annoying !} Bxc3 13. bxc3 h6 {c5 might be better.} 14. Nf3 c5 15. Rb1 Nc6 {Make way for Queen start shooting pawns} 16. Be3 Qa5 17. Rb3 Be6 18. c4 Nd4 19. Nxd4 {Correct choice !} exd4 20. Bd2 Qc7 21. c3 dxc3 22. Bxc3 Nh7 {Avoiding weakening my kingside. Knight can either go f8 or g5 depending on his next move ...} 23. Qc2 Bd7 {Make way for Rook breathing heavily down but .....} 24. Rfb1 Ba4 {Annoying pinning again !} 25. Bf3 Bxb3 26. Rxb3 Rab8 27. Be4 Rxb3 28. Qxb3 {Gain materials advantage} Ng5 29. f3 Nxe4 {Getting rid of the Bishop when approaching endgame} 30. fxe4 Qf4 {d3 is becoming a target} 31. Qd1 Qe3+ 32. Kh1 Rd8 33. Qd2 Rxd3 {Bang !} 34. Qxe3 Rxe3 {There is no defend for e4 and c4 and he wisely resigned.}
