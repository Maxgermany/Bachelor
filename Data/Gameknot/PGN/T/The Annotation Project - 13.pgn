1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 {This is the start of the thematic mini tournament.  nuntar won the first of the two games which I think will be Annotated by him soon.  Best line Bxf7 Kd7 Be6+ Kc7 Bxg4 so we'll go to there. } 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 {White now has the initiative while black has the material advantage.  Blacks game will most likely transpire into a waiting game where he tries to trade down and keep his king safe.  Whites plan will be to force a minor piece attack and try to win back some of the lost material if not the game.} Qb6 {Qb6?! Qe8 is more likely better because Qb6 cuts off Kb6 a6 Ka7 trying to hide away.  This was an experiment I wanted to try out just waiting and keeping my queen away from the action to focus on defense.  Other possibilities are e6 trying for activation.  g7 which is an attempt to be very active trying to trade off quickly.  I wouldn't suggest Qb6 mostly because if white can get off Nc3 Nf7 Ne5+ the king and queen are going to get forked.} 10. Nf7 Rg8 11. Ne5+ {Ne5+ white begins to take dominance over the center and try to force a fork of my king and queen. } Kc7 12. Nc3 e6 {e6 stops the fork for the moment but has a down side of giving white a passed pawn.  Kd8 or Qa6 are other options to look into but I kinda liked this one because it gave me some time.  Though probably not the best choice because that pawn will be very hard to stop.} 13. f5 Na6 14. fxe6 Rd8 {I gave white a passed pawn so I could get activity of my pieces.  Dangerous but in this game it worked out.} 15. Nf7 Rd4 {Maintains protection form the nasty Nd5 fork and centralizes a piece I felt a bit bad about placing my rook so far up the board early in the game but white can't attack it quite yet. } 16. Ne2 Rc4 17. b3 Rxc2 18. Nc3 {White traps my rook in after I win a pawn.} Kb8 {My king is now safe from whites pieces I can start to try to build some form of a counter attack.} 19. Kd1 {Forces the rook to take something.} Rxc3 20. dxc3 {I decide to take the Knight for two reasons one it gives me a passed pawn on e4 and it takes whites active piece.  Though another interesting option would have been Rxc1+ Rxc1 Nc7 likely winning the pawn on e6 breaking up the bind on my Bishop and rook.} Nc7 {Trying to attack and win the passed pawn.} 21. Bf4 {White pins me down stopping me form winning the pawn.} Be7 22. Kc2 {Not sure I really understand this move I thought Re1 was best trying to win my pawn.} Kc8 {I unpin my knight forcing the exchange to take place.  Kinda felt that Ka8 was slightly better because of the fact that I may face e7+ in my future.} 23. Bxc7 Qxc7 24. Rad1 Qf4 {Qf4 defends my e4 pawn and gains a tempo on the bishop.} 25. Bh3 e3 {I start marching my pawn.} 26. Rhf1 {Rhf1?? this is the blunder that I think lost white the game.  I felt white was winning up till this point.} Qe4+ {Qe4+! if Kc1 or Kb2 i win a rook with e2.  Also Bf5 Qxg2+ followed up with e2.  Rd3 was played in game.} 27. Rd3 {White tried what I felt was best.  But it pins the rook to the king so I begin an attack on it.} b5 {My opponent resigns here.  I was looking at the following combination 28. Re1 c4 29. Rxe3 cxd3+ 30. Rxd3 winning a rook.  I still feel there was a lot of play left in this game but, I'm fairly sure black is winning now.}
