1. e3 Nf6 2. d3 e5 3. h3 d5 4. a3 Bd6 5. Be2 e4 {I was going to suggest that a developing move like 5...0-0 would have been better here, but the move played prevents White developing his king's knight, so in this case it's probably better. Well seen!} 6. dxe4 dxe4 7. Nc3 Nc6 8. g4 {Threatening to dislodge the knight on f6 that is protecting the pawn on e4.} Be5 {You had a promising position, but this is bad. 8...h6 was necessary to counter the threat of 9.g5. Disregarding that, you shouldn't move the same piece twice in the opening.} 9. Qxd8+ Nxd8 10. Bd2 {Not the best move. 10.g5 would have won the e-pawn which is still preventing the development of the knight.} Bxc3 {I guess this is one way of safeguarding the pawn, but now your opponent is ahead on development.} 11. Bxc3 Ne6 {e6 is the obvious square for the bishop, so 11...Nc6 was better.} 12. Bxf6 {I don't think this was a good exchange for White. The bishop is a better piece than the knight in an open position like this.} gxf6 13. O-O-O {White gains control of the only open file, which could be significant.} a6 {Another bad move. You urgently need to develop your three remaining pieces.} 14. f3 {White finally finds a way of developing his knight.} Ng5 {Once again the priority was the three undeveloped pieces - even at the expense of a pawn.} 15. h4 exf3 16. Nxf3 Bxg4 {Giving up a knight for two pawns is not a good idea at this stage of the game.} 17. hxg5 fxg5 18. Rd4 Bxf3 19. Bxf3 c6 20. Bg4 {Rooks work best in partnership, so 20.Rhe1 was best.} f6 {A wasted move. Black needs to get his rooks behind the passed pawns and start pushing them!} 21. Bf5 {This actively encourages the pawn to leap forward!} h6 {Why not h5?} 22. Rhd1 {At last! White's three pieces are now all pointing at the key square d7. Once that square is occupied by a white rook, the game is effectively over.} O-O 23. Be6+ Kg7 24. Rd4d7+ Kh8 25. Bf5 Kg8 26. Rxb7 Rad8 27. Rdd7 Rxd7 28. Rxd7 Re8 29. e4 Kf8 30. Rh7 Kg8 31. Rxh6 Kg7 32. Rh7+ {}
