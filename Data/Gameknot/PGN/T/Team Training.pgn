1. e4 {Standard opening to grab some of the center} e5 {Have to counter or lose some of the center myself.} 2. Nf3 {Develop with a threat.} Nc6 {Counter that threat and develop at the same time.} 3. Nc3 {Development on knight is good.} Nf6 {And I counter with my knight to keep development even.} 4. Bc4 {Bishoped developed which allows for 0-0 next move.} Bc5 {This move also develops my bishop and allows for 0-0 next move.} 5. O-O {Castling to protect the king.} O-O {And again.} 6. Ng5 {Not sure about this move.  But I do see a bishop and knight trade for a rook and pawn.} h6 {Lets see if I am right.} 7. Nxf7 {And the trade off begins.  Just have to wonder if rook and pawn or knight and bishop is more important.} Rxf7 {and the capture.} 8. Bxf7+ {In with the bishop to take the rook} Kxf7 {and recapture.} 9. Na4 {Pressure the loose bishop.} Nxe4 {Grab a pawn and protect the bishop at the same time.  But leaving self open for attack.} 10. Qf3+ {As we see here.  Both my knight and bishop under attack and can only save the knight by blocking check.} Nf6 {And the smart move.} 11. Nxc5 {Now capture the loose bishop.} Nd4 {Put heat on my queen with an eye of moving my knight to c2.  Hoping for a bad queen move here.} 12. Qe4 {With the queen move, the pin on the f6 knight is gone.} Nxe4 {And so is the queen.  } 13. Nxe4 {At the price of a knight.} Nxc2 {Grab a pawn and pressure the rook.} 14. Rb1 {Move the rook to saftey} Qh4 {Put some pressure on the knight} 15. d3 {Good protect.}
