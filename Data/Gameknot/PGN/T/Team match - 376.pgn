1. e4 {The King's Pawn Play.} c5 {I respond to his king pawn's play by starting the Sicilian Defense, and this is the, "cornerstone", of that.  } 2. c4 {I am not sure why he picked this candidate instead of transposing his King's Pawn Play into the King's Knight Opening because he would be able to develop his minor pieces and castle.  In addition, this would have been the, "coping mechanism", to the Sicilian Defense.} d6 {Because he did not bring out the knight, followed by d4, I am able to finish the Sicilian Defense.  In my opinion, this defense is .} because it is my favorite.} 3. d3 {I am not sure why he chose that candidate because he could have forced an exchange, if he played 3.d4, cxd4 4.Qxd4.  In this position, an even exchange would not have hurt him or I because we have the same amount of material on the board, and there have not been captures, currently.  } Nc6 {In my opinion, this was a ! because it will enable me to play Nd4, so I will have a tactical advantage, at this point. } 4. b3 {I do not know what this move does or how it benefits him because I am still going to play Nd4, regardless.} Nd4 {In this position, I, "box in" his pawn on d3, in addition to c4.} 5. f3 {I do not know why he chose that candidate because he would not have been able to play a fork against me between my queen on d1 and rook on h1, due to my king on e1.} Nf6 {At this point, I decide to bring out my other knight in order to finish developing minor pieces on the king's and queen's side.} 6. Ne2 {He brought out his knight in order to force an exchange with Nxe2, followed Bxe2.} Nxe2 7. Bxe2 g6 {I do not know why I chose that candidate, so this move is !?, in my opinion.} 8. h3 {I learned in High School that this position is called a, "pigs in a blanket", and it is a .} setup because the pawns cover all of the white square and protect most of the opponent's pieces due to the position.  Before that happened, I thought that a, "pigs in a blanket", only referred to hot dogs wrapped in a special roll.  } Qa5+ {I respond by checking him, but it is a ? because he will protect his king with the bishop, and I will, therefore, be placed in an uncomfortable and dangerous position.} 9. Bd2 {In this position, he now threatens to capture my queen for free with Bxa5, so I am now forced to run away from danger.} Qc7 {Shamash calls this move a, "Protective Panacea", because it protects my queen.} 10. O-O {At this point, he is now able to castle, but I am unable to castle until I move my bishop on the king's or queen's side.} Bg7 {Therefore, I move my bishop on the king's side because I would rather castle on the King's side, as opposed to, the Queen's side, when possible, to avoid an early king exposure.  In addition, I form a, "Fanchette", by playing Bg7 instead of Bh6.} 11. Bc3 {He responds by forming a, "Fanchette".} O-O {Now, I am able to castle in an area that won't expose the king.} 12. f4 {I do not know why he chose that candidate because it destroys his, "pigs in a blanket".} Qb6 {I made this move because I wanted to put pressure on the b square.} 13. f5 {He made chose that candidate in order to force an exchange with gxf5, followed by, 14.Rxf5,Bxf5.  15.exf5, and I did not think that it would give him a tactical advantage because we have the same amount of material since the score is 0, for us.  However, I was wrong because I will end up being, "down material", because I will have a -2, after the exchange is finished, so this candidate was ?. } gxf5 14. Rxf5 Bxf5 15. exf5 Nd7 {I figured that moving my knight away would, "bail me out" of trouble, but I was wrong because he will threaten to capture my rook with Bxa1.   He will also force an exchange with Bxg7 followed by Kxg7.  However, I do not want the exchange because I am, "down material", so this move was also ?, in my opinion.} 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. g4 {I am not sure what he accomplishes with this move.} Ne5 {I am not sure why I picked that candidate because I cannot capture his pawn with Nxg4 due to his pawn on h3, and I cannot capture his pawn with Nxc4 due to his pawns on d3 and b3.} 18. Nc3 {In this position, he threatens to play a fork between my pawn on e7 and my queen on b6, but I am not about to let him do that.} Qb4 {This is how I prevented the fork, but it is an ??.  In fact, it was my biggest mistake.  Instead, I should have played Qc6 instead of Qb4 because it would have also prevented the fork, and Qc6 was my first instinct.  In addition, Qc6 would have given me more opportunities to correct my mistakes and, "get back in the game".  However, Jack would say that Qb4, ..."looses immediately", due to the position.   } 19. Nd5 {Now, he threatens to capture my queen with Nxb4.} Qa3 {This move to protect my queen, and it is one of my only options because I do not have many choices.  However, he will now get a free pawn with Nxe7, and it is not an extenuating circumstance where I should give away free material.  That is because it is not a, "deflective sacrifice", but there is nothing that I can do to protect since it is inevitable. } 20. Nxe7 Kf6 {In this position, I threaten to capture his free knight with Kxe7, but it is now, "too little too late".} 21. Nd5+ {Now, he checks me, so I attempt to find a way out of trouble with a three fold repetition.  This is how I got out of trouble in my game against paulr1212, and that game is mentioned in a different annotation.  However, I am not successful in this gamer, and it is again, "too little too late".} Kg5 {This is where I try to get a three fold repetition because I move my pieces back and forth, but he finds a way out of it.  Therefore, he will check mate me later in the game, and it is also inevitable. } 22. Kh2 Kh4 23. Qe1+ Kg5 24. Qd2+ Kh4 25. Qh6# {Before this game, I thought that it was best to go by my first choice during an exam.  I learned that the same thing is true in chess, from this particular game.  In addition, this is the first time that I have lost a team game because of a checkmate.  In previous team games, I have lost due to resignation.  }
