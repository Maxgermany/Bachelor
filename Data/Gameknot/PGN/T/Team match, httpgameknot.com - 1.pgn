1. e4 {I started with the most popular 1. e4} c5 {My opponent goes for Sicilian defence with 1.....c5.} 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 {Now the game is in Sicilian, Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence, the next move for white is 4. Nxc3} 4. Bc4 {But I rather developed my bishop, and try to get some kind of Danish gambit, Collijn defence, if he takes my b pawn, then I take wit my bishop. (Its not really Danish gambit, Collijn defence, because black didn't start with 1.....e5)} e6 5. Nxc3 Nc6 6. Nf3 d6 {Now the game is back in lines of Sicilian, Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence} 7. O-O {Book} a6 {Book} 8. Be3 {Out of books. The book move is 8. Qe2, but I rather developed my bishop. I don't know, if there are any disadvantages for this move?} Nf6 9. Nd4 {I try to weaken his Queen side.} Ne5 10. Bb3 {I want that bishop to stay alive.} Bd7 11. h3 {Preparing for attack on King side.} b5 {Creating an outpost for his knight.} 12. f4 Nc4 {Well there is an ugly fork on e3, so I must eliminate his knight.} 13. Bxc4 bxc4 14. e5 {And now is time to open up f file. If he plays 14.... dxe5, then in a couple of exchanges my Queen and rook will be on the f file threatening mate on f7.} dxe5 15. fxe5 {His knight has nowhere to go accept back on g8 or d5 for some more exchanges.} Nd5 16. Nxd5 exd5 17. Qf3 {This position I saw back in 14 move , when I predicted, that my opponent will exchange his peaces. I don't know, how black should react in this position.} f5 {Surly not that way.} 18. exf6 e.p. Qxf6 {Nice now the game is near the end.} 19. Qxd5 {If he wants to protect his rook and Queen, he must bring his Queen back to the 8th rank. If he wants to stay alive, he must sacrifice his rook. Are there any other possibilities?} Qd8 20. Qf7# {And checkmate. Thanks for watching and commenting. Have a nice day.}
