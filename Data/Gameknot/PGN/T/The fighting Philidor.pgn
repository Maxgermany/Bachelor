1. e4 d6 {The best way to enter the Philidor} 2. d4 Nf6 { } 3. Nc3 Nbd7 { } 4. Nf3 {This was the first time that one of my opponents had allowed me to reach a Philidor.  Up to this point everyone had played 4.f4 which is fine for Black.  See for example:  http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-philidor-getting-my-feet-wet-internet?gm=45300} e5 {Arriving at the Philidor } 5. Bc4 { } Be7 {This natural move prepares for short castling. } 6. O-O {The game has reached the main line of the Philidor Hanham.   The two most popular plans for Black are: (1)  aiming for Queenside expansion by means of ...b5, or (2) securing c5 for his knight.  The second plan would be reached by ...a5, sometimes preceded by the exchange ...exd4. } O-O { } 7. h3 {?! an inaccuracy.  The two main lines are 7. a4 and 7.Qe2 } c6 { Nisipeanu-Baurer, Bastia 2001 went. 7... c6 8. a4 Nxe4! 9. Bxf7+ (9. Nxe4 d5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. dxe5 dxe4 (11... dxc4 12. Nd6)) 9... Rxf7 10. Nxe4 exd4 11. Nfg5 Bxg5 12. Qxd4 d5.  7.Be3?! would have allowed the same trick. } 8. dxe5 Nxe5 {  8... dxe5 9. Qe2 = } 9. Bb3 b5 { } 10. a3 a5 11. Qe2 Ba6 { } 12. Nxe5 b4 { ? shouldn't work Better was:  12... dxe5 13. Rd1 Qc7 14. Qf3 = } 13. Nc4 { better was  13. Nxc6 Bxe2 14. Nxd8 bxc3 15. Nc6  with an advantage for White. } bxc3 { with an equal position} 14. Rd1 {14. Re1 d5 15. exd5 cxd5 16. Qxe7 Qxe7 17. Rxe7 dxc4 = } Qc7 {  14... d5!? 15. exd5 cxd5 with an edge for Black} 15. Qf3 Nxe4 {? Much better was 15... d5  16. exd5 Nxd5 = } 16. Qxe4 {With a huge advantage for White} d5 { The point of Black's 15...Nxe4, but there is a flaw and White can come out a piece up.} 17. Qg4 {This throws away the advantage.  the knight can be saved. correct was 17. Qe5  Qb8 18. Qxb8 (18. Qxc3 ?! Bf6 19. Ne5 Qxe5 20. Qxc6 d4 and Black has an edge) 18... Rfxb8 19. Ne5 saving the knight leaving White a piece up.} dxc4 { } 18. Bxc4 Bxc4 { } 19. Qxc4 cxb2 { } 20. Bxb2 Rfd8 { } 21. Qg4 Bf8 22. Rd4 Rxd4 { } 23. Bxd4 Re8 { } 24. a4 Qe7 { } 25. Bc3 Qc5 { } 26. Qd4 Qxd4 { } 27. Bxd4 {The pawn structure is symmetrical.  The position is equal.  White has a slight initiative although I don't think he can do anything with it.  With the White bishop and rook on the same diagonal I decide to try to exchange bishops after which I am confident it is a draw.  } g6 28. Kf1 Bg7 { } 29. Bxg7 Kxg7 {My draw offer is accepted. }
