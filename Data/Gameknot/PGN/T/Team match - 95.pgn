1. f4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. d4 Bb4+ 4. c3 Nc6 {I literally cannot remember what I was thinking that led me to believe that losing my bishop like this was a good idea.} 5. cxb4 {Oops. Lost my bishop. } Nxb4 6. Bd2 Bd7 {And then I make a second mistake and almost kill my knight, but for some reason, White doesn't take the knight. } 7. a3 Nc6 8. Qa4 Nf6 9. e3 Ne7 {Threatening the queen} 10. Bb4 {White doesn't see that the queen is in danger.} Bxa4 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 {Exchange complete.} 12. Nc3 Bc6 {Wanting to keep my bishop for now.} 13. O-O-O Ne4 14. Nxe4 dxe4 {Exchange of knights.} 15. Ne5 Qd6 16. Nxc6 Qxc6+ {Exchange complete. } 17. Kb1 Qa4 {Threatening the rook.} 18. Ka2 {Not sure why White made this move. A better move might have been Bc4 to regain some territory and protect the Rook. } Qxd1 19. b4 Qd2+ 20. Kb3 {What follows is a series of Queen taking various pawns and checking the King. } Qxe3+ 21. Ka4 Qxf4 22. Bc4 e3 23. Rf1 Qxd4 24. Bb3 Qd7+ {Cleaned out some of White's pawns and now beginning to work on a checkmate.} 25. b5 a6 {White can't take the pawn, and my next move could be Qxb5# with the pawn supporting the queen.} 26. Kb4 {White is avoiding mate here.} Qxb5+ 27. Kc3 Qc5+ 28. Bc4 Qxa3+ 29. Bb3 Qc5+ 30. Bc4 O-O 31. h4 {Now I want to get my rooks out of the back rank so they can support my queen.} Qe5+ 32. Kb4 a5+ 33. Ka4 b5+ {White can take my pawn with the Bishop but I have a possible mate in Qd4+ followed by Qb4#, as the Bishop will no longer be protecting the King.} 34. Bxb5 Qd4+ 35. Ka3 Qb4+ 36. Ka2 {White's only move.} Qxb5 {I'm free to capture the Bishop, which could possibly be a problem in preventing mate.} 37. h5 Rab8 {Moving my rook to support the queen.} 38. g4 {The only move that could have possibly prevented mate at this point is Rf2, preventing my queen from checking on the f-row, but then my pawn could have taken it. } Qb2# {Mate. I think White was doomed upon losing both the Queen and Rook and willingly exchanging bishops and knights. My personal theory is that if the score isn't tied or if I don't have an advantage, I refrain from trading or exchanging pieces unless absolutely necessary, especially if I'm behind more than one or two pawns. }
