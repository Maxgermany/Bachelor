1. d4 {An unrated challenge from a friend. He let me play white and I felt like branching out a bit, so I played a closed game (not my usual choice as white).} d5 2. c4 {Queen's Gambit} dxc4 3. Nf3 {Black accepted the gambit, so I continue by developing along orthodox lines.} Nc6 4. d5 {I guess this is called the side variation. I don't know much about it, so I'm winging it from here. I think I'm supposed to claim the center with 4. e4 but I decide to defer that by one move.} Na5 5. e4 {5. Qa4  was tempting, but black might be able to weasel out with 5. ... c6, although one feasible continuation seems to be 6. Bd2 b6 7. Bxa5 bxa5 8. Qxc6  Bd7 9. Qxc4 leaving white ahead by a pawn, and black's doubled pawns on the a-file will do him no favors.} Qd6 6. Qa4+ {OK, now it works quite nicely. Black might have wanted to consider alternatives to early development of his queen, as well as consider the precarious and ineffective position of his knight on the edge of the board with no safe move. 5. ... b6 would be a consideration here, as would be 5. ... c6 or 5. ... Bd7.} Nc6 7. dxc6 {White wins the black knight and in the process, triples the black pawns on the c-file.} Qxc6 8. Qxc6+ {Black offers the exchange of queens which white is willing to accept, given his material advantage and the fact that the black queen is more centrally located and making threats against white's center.} bxc6 9. Bxc4 {As much as I enjoy my opponent's tripled pawns, it seems prudent to develop my bishop, seize more of the center, and put pressure on black's weak pawn at f7.} Nf6 10. Nc3 {Developing, defending. I'm back on track with general opening principles now, but apparently so is my opponent.} Be6 11. Bxe6 {I cannot resist the double temptation of exchanging material (extending my material advantage by reducing the number of active pieces on the board thus increasing the scope of my extra piece) and doubling and isolating more of black's pawns.} fxe6 12. Bf4 {Developing, center, threatening. All good. Note the difference in development here. White has 3 pieces developed to black's 1. In addition, white has dominated the center and is poised to castle to bring his rooks to bear. On the other hand, black cannot easily develop his bishop or his kingside rook. The black pieces and pawns are getting in each others' way. And let's not overlook black's hopeless pawn structure. It's clearly time for white to attack.} Rc8 13. Ne5 {Black's reply was expected, but now more of his pawns must fall. With his pawn structure in ruins, the loss of some of those pawns was inevitable.} c5 14. Nc6 {Hunting pawns.} Nh5 15. Be3 {Black counterattacked my bishop, so it's time to hunt another pawn.} c4 16. Bxa7 {Gobble.} Nf4 17. O-O {Uh oh, black's pieces are approaching. Time to run to safety in the castle and bring my rooks together. It's useful to observe that white now has 4 pieces developed to black's 2, and calling black's rook on c8 "developed" is generous - it has nowhere to go and is tied to defending the blocked c7 pawn against the inevitable Nb5 that white is just itching to play.} e5 18. Nxe5 {Black gave away his e6 pawn, but doubled and isolated as it was, this is not really too much of a loss.} e6 19. Nxc4 {Gobble. At least now black has gained freedom for his bishop to enter the game.} Bb4 20. Bd4 {Of course white is willing to exchange. Black can do some damage to my pawn structure with 21. ... Bxc3 and 22. ... Ne7  and 23. ... Nxc3, but it costs him as he will exchange minor pieces twice, something he cannot afford to do. Meanwhile, I am threatening another pawn, this time on the kingside at g7.} O-O 21. Be5 {Forking the knight and the c7 pawn. I cannot take the c7 pawn yet, but it cannot be a bad thing to tie black's rook down to the defense.} Ng6 22. Nb5 {More pawn hunting.} c6 23. Nd4 {At this point, black can continue defending pawns, say by 23. ... Rfe8, but I would meet that with 24. Nd6 forcing an exchange of material. Black is down by a minor piece and two pawns, and faced with exchanging more material and a hopeless endgame. His lonely isolated pawn on c6 cannot be saved - white has more pieces to bring to bear against it than black has to defend it. Black chooses to wave the flag of surrender.}
