1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {Probably expecting a benoni} Bb4 {... but black choses another line} 4. Nf3 {Neglecting the in and developping} b6 5. e3 Bb7 6. Bd3 {Carrying on developping} O-O {Black could have opt for a long castle after 6. Nc6} 7. O-O {Both kings in safe} d5 {The d pawn is overprotected.} 8. cxd5 {but white takes} exd5 9. a3 {Off !} Bd6 {Retreat} 10. b4 {White gains space on the queenside} a6 {To prevent 11. Nb5 and prepare b5} 11. Qb3 {aiming at d5 and the weak f7} Qe7 {To control c5 and have a look at d4} 12. Rb1 {Preparing a further b5} Nbd7 {aiming at c5} 13. a4 {gaining space} Rfe8 {reinforcing the control of the e semi open file.} 14. g3 {I'm not sure about this move. probably white wants to accentuate his control on f4 to avoid being obliged to take with the e pawn in case if f4 is under attack. It leaves the f knight without protection but black has no way to attack it for the moment.} c6 {reinforcing d5 an preparing a further b5 which would block white on the queenside.} 15. Nd2 {The unprotected knight leaves, white menaces 16. e4. This is the exlanation of 14. g3} Rab8 {Now black can play 15. ... c5 or 16. a5, his bishop is protected against a white queen's attack.} 16. e4 {challenging the d pawn} c5 {black prefers to keep on his own attack than to counter the white one} 17. Nxd5 {Charge !} Nxd5 18. exd5 cxd4 {The trading sequence is over. The center is still contested, black controls one open file, material is equal, both pawn structure are ok, white controls more space on the queenside. The position is equilibrated with a slight advantage for black (it seems to me)} 19. Nf3 {Of course, the next targets will be the 2 advanced pawns.} Nf6 20. Bg5 {preventing 21. Nxd5 and joining the rooks} Bxd5 {A wild trading sequence begins} 21. Bxf6 Qe6 22. Nxd4 Bxb3 23. Nxe6 Bxe6 24. Bg5 {Now the game is wide opened. Black's control on the open file is not effective anylonger, material is equal, black's control on the center is slighly better. White still controls more field on the queenside. black's a pawn is under direct menace. White has 2 pieces unprotected against one for black. The situation seems equal.} b5 {To prevent 25. Bxa6} 25. axb5 {trading.} axb5 26. Rfc1 {taking control of the second open file.} Bd5 {to unmask the e rook and block the white king.} 27. Be3 {partially blocking the e file and preparing a further Bd4} Red8 {I do not understand this move.} 28. Bd4 {A fine row of bishops !} Bf3 {... not for long. Black will move his 2 bishops to menace d4 with his rook.} 29. Rb3 {White cannot protect d4 but when he'll have to move the DSB, the LSB will be protected.} Bd5 {... so that the black bishop is back in the row.} 30. Rbb1 {Back to a previous situation. White seems to be looking for a draw.} Bf3 {... and black plays the same.} 31. Ba7 {but white's not trying to draw in moment.} Rb7 {Still protecting the b pawn and menacing the DSB} 32. Be3 {Bishop protected} Be7 {attacking the LSB "à découverte" } 33. Bf1 {No other place to carry on menacing b5} Be4 34. Rb2 f5 {Pawn advance, preparing the game end} 35. Bg2 {menacing 36. Bxe4 fxe4 and black has an isolated pawn.} Bxg2 {... so that black has to take} 36. Kxg2 Kf7 {King toward the center} 37. Bc5 {White is looking for exchanges but why ?} Rc8 38. Rcc2 {Probably to set the rook on a light square because black has only the DSB left} Rbc7 {doubling the rook on open file and pinning the DSB} 39. Rcd2 {unpinning the DSB} Bxc5 {Exchanging - black will gain one pawn in the bargain} 40. bxc5 Rc7xc5 {Black is now one pawn ahead} 41. Rd7+ {To prepare to double the rooks} Kf6 {Protecting g7 and sending the king as near as possible of the center} 42. Rd6+ {This move enables the black king to approach the center} Ke5 {... which it does} 43. Rb6 {White will equalize in material} g5 44. Rb6xb5 {Material is equal, rooks doubled on an open file. Both pawn structures are similar. The black king is more centralized and the black pawns are more advanced, black has a slight advantage...} Rxb5 {... so that it takes} 45. Rxb5+ Kf6 46. Rb6+ {White is looking for a draw, trying perpetual check.} Kg7 47. Rb7+ Kg6 48. Rb6+ Kg7 49. Rb7+ Kg6 50. Rb6+ Kf7 {Black refuses to draw.} 51. Rb7+ Kg8 52. Re7 Rf8 {Now, the black king is blocked on the 8th line, white's situation is better than previously} 53. f4 {Proposing a trade} h6 {53. gxf4 would have meant draw.} 54. Kf3 {advancing the king toward the center} Ra8 {freeing the rook.} 55. fxg5 {Black has to take. If 55. ... Ra3+ 56. Kf4 and black loses one pawn} hxg5 56. Ke3 {Keeping the king as near as possible from the center} Ra3+ 57. Kd4 {Centralized king.} Ra4+ 58. Ke3 Ra3+ 59. Kd4 Ra4+ 60. Ke3 Rb4 {Black still doesn't want a draw} 61. Re5 {menacing both pawns} Rb3+ {Initiating a sequence to protect the f pawn.} 62. Kd4 Rf3 {f pawn protected but the black rook is less mobile.} 63. Ra5 {To enable 64. Ke5} Kf7 {preventing a further Ke6 which would have meant the loss of one pawn for black.} 64. Ke5 {White king in safe (if 64. ... Re3+ 65. Kxf5} Kg6 {To enable 65. ... Re3+} 65. Ra6+ Kh5 {Black takes risks to enable the king to support an attack on the white pawns} 66. Ra8 {To enable a further Rg8 or Rh8} Kg4 {To enable  a further f4} 67. Rg8 {pinning the g pawn to the king.} f4 {Black still plays 67. ... f4} 68. gxf4 {No choice for white} Rxf4 69. h3+ {White proposes to trade, still looking for a draw.} Kh5 {Black doesn't want to draw.} 70.
