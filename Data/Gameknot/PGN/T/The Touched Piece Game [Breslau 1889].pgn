1. e4 {Tarrasch opens in traditional style.} e5 {Alapin counters the same way.} 2. Nf3 {The usual move.} Nf6 {Alapin goes for Petrov's defense.} 3. Nxe5 {Book.} d6 {Avoiding the well-known trap 3... NxP? 4 Q-K2! and Black loses at least a Pawn.} 4. Nf3 {The book retreat.} Nxe4 {Now this capture is safe.} 5. d3 {According to Irving Chernev, here is what happened: "At this point, Tarrasch played 5 P-K3. Alapin hardly looked at the board, as he expected 5 P-K4, the customary move at the time. Almost automatically he touched his King Bishop, as he intended to answer 5 P-K4 with 5... B-K2. Imagine his horror when he saw that his King Knight was attacked, and he could not move it! He had touched his Bishop, and regardless of the consequences, he had to move his Bishop!"   Alapin resigned at once. To play out the game a whole piece down against a master as great as Tarrasch would be hopeless.}
