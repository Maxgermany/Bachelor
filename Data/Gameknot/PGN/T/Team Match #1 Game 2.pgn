[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 {Standard king's pawn. As white, I never play this, ever.} d5 {Scandinavian. This is fun and exciting, but if white plays 2. e5, it becomes annoying to knock out the pawn.} 2. e5 {Aggressive.} Nc6 {Standard development. 2. e5 e3 would also work.} 3. f4 {(?) Why not d4? 3. f4 weakens the kingside.} e6 4. Bb5 {Pinning the knight to the king, as well as developing the kingside.} Bd7 5. c3 {(!) Plans to play d4, creating a pawn chain, and aiming for Qa4.} Bc5 {This frees up e7 for the knight, attacks f2, and develops the bishop.} 6. b4 {(?) d4 would have been better, as it blocks the a7-g1 diagonal, and creates a pawn chain.} Bb6 {Running back to e7 would be pointless, so Bb6 is my only option.} 7. d4 Nge7 {Developing the knight, and getting ready to castle.} 8. Qg4 {(!) Obviously, the queenside is a wreck, and so white moves the queen to a strong position.} Ng6 {This prevents any attempts for checkmate later in the game, opens the queen diagonal, and strengthens the kingside.} 9. Nf3 {The kingside is now safe, so white seizes the opportunity to castle.} O-O 10. Nh4 {(?) This is basically giving black a knight.} Qxh4+ 11. Qxh4 Nxh4 12. Nd2 {(?) Why not castle?} Nxg2+ 13. Kf2 Nxf4 {Remember the old adage, eat a pawn chain from the back.} 14. Kf3 Ng6 15. a4 {Attempting to win a bishop.} a6 {(!) A6 both rids the white bishop, and provides an escape route for the bishop.} 16. Bd3 {(?) White should have traded bishops. The black bishop on d7 is basically trapped, and white could move the dark bishop out, and it creates triple pawns for black.} Nh4+ {(?) Probably pointless.} 17. Kg4 Ng2 {(?) The black knight is trapped. Nf5 or Ng6 would be better.} 18. Nf3 h5+ {(?) Pointless.} 19. Kxh5 g6+ {I made this move to lure the king closer. Flip the board and see how crowded black is.} 20. Kh6 g5 {(?) Pointless yet again.} 21. Rg1 {Attacks the knight, and after taking the knight, pinning the pawn. I can't move Nf4 or Nh4, because if the pin.} f6 {I made this move to chip away at white's pawn chain.} 22. Rxg2 fxe5 23. Rxg5+ {And takes with a check. Though behind in material, white has the upper hand in position.} Kh8 24. Nxe5 {Taking back the pawn.} Nxe5 25. Rxe5 Rf3 {(!) Attacks the bishop and the h3 square.} 26. Bh7 {(?) Re3 would be better. This loses to 26. ... Rh3+ 27. Rh5 Rxh5 28. Kxh5 Kxh7.} Rxc3 {(?) I didn't see the earlier move while I was playing.} 27. Rg5 {(?) Pointless?} Rh3+ 28. Rh5 Rxh5+ 29. Kxh5 Kxh7 30. Bh6 c5 {I saw a potential trap. Do you see it?} 31. Rg1 {(?) Now white loses. Watch.} Be8+ 32. Kh4 Bd8+ {(?) I should have took the bishop.} 33. Bg5 Bxg5+ 34. Rxg5 cxb4 {Is this the correct move, or would cxd be better? Please comment.} 35. Rg1 {Obviously to prevent promotion} b5 {This is to open up the a file.} 36. a5 Bg6 {Protects b1.} 37. Kg5 b3 38. Rb1 {(?) Oops for white.} Bxb1 {And now white resigns. Promotion is inevitable, and white's pawns are scattered.}
