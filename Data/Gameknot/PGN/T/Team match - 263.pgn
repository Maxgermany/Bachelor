1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Philidor's Defense. } exd4 {...exchange variation.} 4. Nxd4 a6 {...and not in the GK database.} 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Bc4 Nf6 7. Be3 O-O 8. O-O b5 9. Bd5 Nxd5 10. exd5 Bb7 11. Qg4 b4 12. Nf5 {Black must respond to imminent mate.} Bf6 {That does nicely.} 13. Qxb4 Qc8 14. Qg4 {I didn't see the value of this.  Nh6+ doesn't net the queen with Bb7 and Rf8 both guarding her.} Nd7 15. Ne4 {Looks like white is tossing Pd5 to the dogs, and re8 will put pressure on Ne4.} Bxd5 16. Nxf6+ {...did NOT see that one coming.  NxN does not prevent checkmate.  Fast game! }
