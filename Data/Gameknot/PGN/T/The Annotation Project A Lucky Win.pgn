1. e4 {Another game from the Annotation Project. I've chosen this one to annotate not because of my lucky win, but because I got into a horrible position and I'd love to know where I went wrong. If you've looked at any of the other games from this tournament, the first few moves will be familiar to you, so I won't comment on them here.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ {The first "free choice" move, but the next couple of moves are pretty much forced anyway. White must knock Black's king out into the open and take the knight on g4, as otherwise he has insufficient compensation for the queen.} Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6 {And now the choices really start. This gives up a pawn, but gives Black a chance to catch up in development. It also indirectly defends against the fork on f7: 10. Nf7? Qh4+} 10. Nc3 {This is only my second game as Black in this tournament; in the earlier game, yoshark took the pawn and I won. 10. Nc3 instead develops the knight, threatens to take on e4, and controls more of the squares around the Black king.} Na6 {I got this move from the database; also played by jstevens in the recent annotated game "A Hard Win". It does develop and creates the possibility of Nb4 threatening c2, but after how this game went I can't say I see that much merit in the idea.} 11. Bxe6 {According to dmaestro's comment on jstevens' annotation, "11. a3! has been proven necessary". To prevent Nb4?} Nb4 {If so, then this should be very good for Black. I don't know. I'm still being guided by the database here, which proves to be a disaster.} 12. Kd1 {This is the first deviation from the database. (The more common move is 12. Bb3.) It scuppers Black's threat of Nxc2, and now the advanced knight seems to be simply misplaced.} Qe8 {For now preventing 13. Nf7.} 13. Bf7 Qd7 {Why this square in particular? It seemed preferable to e7, as it pins the d-pawn and so hinders White's development, while not blocking any of Black's pieces. However, it is a light square and thus vulnerable to continued harassment by the bishop. In fact, White could immediately repeat by 14. Be6, after which I might well have played 14... Qe8 for similar reasons.} 14. Bb3 {Threatening the skewer 15. Ba4+ winning the queen. (If 15... b5, 16. Bxb5+ reinstating the skewer.)} Kc7 {Maybe I should have played 14... b5? Anyway, the idea behind this move was to give the knight somewhere to retreat and to get the king into safety on b8 (preferably after moving the rook out). Also gets out of the way of the threatened Ba4+, though 14... b5 would also prevent this move.} 15. a3 Nc6 16. Be6 {Harassing the queen again.} Qe8 {As prophesied in my note to Black's 13th, I don't see anywhere better for the queen to go. She must continue to attack the e6 bishop and so prevent Nf7, but I still want to try to get my pieces out if White will let me.} 17. Bc4 {Gets the bishop out of the way so Nf7 is threatened.} Rd8 {I didn't see a good way of continuing to prevent Nf7. My experience so far with this bizarre opening is that Black should be willing to accept loss of the exchange, and that lines where White takes the exchange even tend to favour Black. Also, as stated previously, I wanted to get the rook out before playing ...Kb8.} 18. Nf7 Rd7 {Forcing White to capture the less active rook, hoping that my pressure on White's uncastled king will come to something. (It seems unlikely, with the immobile bishop securing the d2 square.)} 19. Nxh8 Bd6 {Perhaps this is the decisive mistake and I should have played 19... a6 followed by 20... Bd6. I wanted to take the knight as quickly as possible in case White could find a way to rescue it. And of course 19... Be7? allows the knight to escape. But this is no better, thanks to a fork:} 20. Nb5+ Kb8 21. Nxd6 Rxd6 22. Nf7 Rd7 {This at least forces the knight to retreat to the passive square h3, but Black just doesn't have enough pieces left to take advantage. At this stage I didn't hold out much hope.} 23. Ng5 h6 24. Nh3 Nd4 {And this is the fluke. I saw a chance to create a cheap threat, and White overlooked it. I'm not trying to disparage my opponent by describing it as cheap; everyone misses these once in a while. I'm just emphasising the hopelessness of Black's position if White had noticed the threat in time to counteract it.} 25. c3 {Instead of this, 25. g4 or 25. Be2 closes the diagonal.} Qh5+ 26. Ke1 {Forced (or 26. g4 Qxg4+, which delays things one move but makes no difference). The only other legal move, 26. Be2, goes down to 26... Qxe2#.} Nc2+ 27. Kf2 {And not 27. Kf1?? Qd1+ 28. Kf2 Qxh1 29. Rb1 Rxd2+ etc. White chose to resign after playing this move, though I think this was premature. Black's material advantage is queen for two bishops, a winning endgame (with pawns still on the board) but not an easy win. And with the other pieces still on the board, Black's knight can only move back and forth between a1 and c2, and White can plan to play b4, Bb2 and Rc1 to win back the knight and rough material equality. Black could probably find some way to rescue the knight, but there is certainly some fight still in the position. Anyway, well played to my opponent, you had me well and truly on the ropes for most of this game.}
