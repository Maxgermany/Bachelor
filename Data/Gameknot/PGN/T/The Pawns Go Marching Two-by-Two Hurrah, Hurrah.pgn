1. e4 {This is one of my longer games with a very interesting endgame.  I go down a pawn early and must fight to attempt to equalize after losing the initiative...} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. f3 Nc6 7. Be3 e6 8. Qd2 Be7 9. O-O-O O-O 10. g4 Nxd4 {At this point I considered recapturing with my bishop as opposed to my queen.  The advantage of a bishop recapture keeps my queen from being overexposed.  The advantage of a queen recapture is a solid central location for the queen.  Both the game database and post game analysis recommend capturing with the queen.  My instinct was to recapture with the bishop.  If anybody can explain whether or not the queen recapture is indeed superior I would appreciate it.} 11. Qxd4 Qc7 12. h4 d5 13. e5 {Attempting to chase the knight away from the king's defense...} Nd7 14. f4 f6 15. g5 fxe5 16. fxe5 Bc5 17. Qd2 Bxe3 18. Qxe3 Qxe5 {Now I am down a pawn and his queen is centrally located.  I did not want to exchange queens as I had a pawn attack formed on the kingside and I wanted to keep my strongest piece for attack options.} 19. Qg1 {Supporting a potential g-pawn advance.} b5 {Queenside charge from black.} 20. Bg2 Rb8 21. Nxd5 {I am trading a piece for two pawns and eliminating blacks brutal pawn center.} exd5 22. Bxd5+ Kh8 23. Bb3 Nb6 24. Qf2 {If 24...Rxf2 then 25. Rd8+ leads to mate.} Bg4 25. Qd4 {Offering the queen which perhaps should have been traded earlier...} Qf4+ {Black trades with the tempo of a Rook activation.} 26. Qxf4 Rxf4 27. Rd6 Nc4 28. Rxa6 Rbf8 29. Bxc4 bxc4 30. a4 Kg8 31. a5 Bf3 32. Rh2 Rf4f7 33. Rb6 Rb7 34. Rxb7 Bxb7 35. b4 cxb3 e.p. 36. cxb3 {And here is where the endgame (in my opinion) begins.  I am the equivalent of a pawn down, but I have two passed pawns on the queenside.  Can I take advantage of this fact?} Ba6 {Blocking the a-pawn advance.} 37. Kb2 Rf4 38. Ka3 Kf7 39. Rc2 Re4 40. Rc5 Re6 41. b4 Re3+ 42. Ka4 Re4 43. Rc6 Re6 44. Rxe6 Kxe6 45. b5 Bb7 46. a6 Bf3 47. Ka5 Kd7 48. Kb6 Kc8 49. Ka7 Be2 50. b6 Bxa6 51. Kxa6 Kb8 52. b7 {The king's only move is c7.  If he moves there then white Ka7 will ensure the b-pawn promotion.  He has the option of advancing his g-pawn or h-pawn, however neither of those options are very good...} h6 {If instead 52...g6 then 53. Kb6 and either 53...Kc7 give white a queen from the b-pawn or 53...h6 gives white a passed pawn on the h-file with a queen to quickly follow.} 53. gxh6 gxh6 54. h5 {And here we see a classic example of Zugzwang.  Black's only legal move is 54...Kc7} Kc7 {Which allows...} 55. Ka7 {And black resigned.}
