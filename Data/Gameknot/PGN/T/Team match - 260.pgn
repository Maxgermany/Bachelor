[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 {My standard first move.  } d6 {The Pirc.  I sometimes play this as Black as it is slightly more off-beat and can lead to some dynamic positions.  } 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 {All pretty standard stuff.} Nbd7 4. Bg5 {Continuing my development and allowing a potential Q-side castle at a later stage.} e5 {A slightly unusual move.  I was expecting c5. } 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. Qe2 {Preparing to castle Q-side or play Rd1.  } c6 {Black is thinking about a Q-side pawn storm perhaps.  I think Bb4 would or Bc5 would have been better. } 7. O-O-O {Castling and some useful pressure on the D-file.} Be7 8. f4 {Trying to opening things up and control the centre.} Qc7 9. fxe5 Qxe5 {I think Nxe5 is better and doesn't lose a tempo. } 10. Nf3 Qc7 11. e5 {Time to strike out!} Ng8 {The only square for the Knight that protects the Bishop and avoids Black's King having to move once exchanged. } 12. Ne4 {Eyeing Nd6+} Bxg5+ 13. Nfxg5 Nh6 {Perhaps anticipating my next move and trying to hold f7.  } 14. Nd6+ Ke7 15. e6 {Pushing on!  Black's King is starting to feel exposed.} Nf6 16. exf7+ {Serious trouble for Black now.  } Kf8 {But can he cling on...} 17. Qe8+ {No! All over now after Nxd8 then fd8= Q or R mating.  Comments appreciated!}
