1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 c5 4. b3 Nc6 5. Bb2 e6 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. O-O {This is my usual setup, I've been fairly successful with it for about a year now. I don't study openings much, so I've pretty much just stuck with this one.} O-O 8. Nbd2 {For a possible e4 push, additional support for a c4 push, or just a developing move.} Re8 9. Ne5 {This time I chose Ne5, normally here I play 1 of 4 moves, c4, e4, a3, or Ne5.} a6 10. f4 {Adding additional support to the e5 knight. It does create a hole on e4, but for now I'm controlling that square.} Qc7 11. a3 {Preventing Nb4 ideas, which, in order to keep my double bishop pair, would force Be2 making it harder to do a kingside attack, which is my plan here.} b5 12. dxc5 {Also to avoid being forced to retreat my bishop with 12...c4.} Bxc5 13. Rf3 {Trying to get a kingside attack going, and protecting e3.} Bd6 {? Totally missing my next two moves, which allow an easy kingside attack. I would have played something like Be7, protecting the f6-knight.} 14. Nxc6 {Uncovering my b2-bishop.} Qxc6 15. Bxf6 {Opening his king up for an attack on the g-file.} gxf6 16. Bxh7+ {For awhile I was planning on Rg1+ Kf8(Kh8 Qg4) Bxh2, with a passed h-pawn and him having a central king. But, then I thought, if he wanted to get checkmated, why not give him the option?} Kxh7 {?? Best was Kf8.} 17. Rg3 {Limiting his king's maneuverability and threatening Qh5 mate.} Kh6 {Either this or Bf8 was the only was to stop mate in 1.} 18. Qg4 {There is now no way to stop a checkmate on the h-file, so my opponent resigned. Thanks for reading, please feel free to comment and rate this annotation and let me know how I did!}
