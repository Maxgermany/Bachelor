1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {The starting position of the thematic mini-tournament -> the Two Knights Defense, or perhaps more appropriately the Tchigorin Counterattack. This move is more aggressive than 3...Bc5 as it attacks e4 and provokes White to attack f7. } 4. Ng5 {White accepts the challenge, looking to win the pawn, but a complicated tactical game will likely ensue, where Black will try to wrest the initiative.} d5 5. exd5 Na5 {Also possible are Nd4 and b5 which share related ideas. Black looks to take over by chasing away the bishop/knight and to take control over the center.} 6. d3 {A questionable move (but played by none other than Morphy) looking to hold the gambit pawn. Usually white plays 6.Bb5+ c6 7.dxc6 bxc6 8.Be2 h6} h6 {The principled reply - pushing back with the intent of e4.} 7. Nf3 e4 8. Nfd2 {Another questionable move, but Black is controlling the game. 8.Qe2 Nxc4 9.dxc4 pinning the e-pawn, or perhaps 8.Ne5 may have been stronger.} Nxc4 9. dxc4 {Stronger would have been 9.Nxc4 unblocking his queen from being attacked. (9.Nxc4 Bg4 10.Qd2 Qxd5 11.Nc3 Qc5 12. O-O O-O-O)} Bg4 {I suspect that Bc5 or Bd6 may have been more thematic, but Bg4 certainly adds complications in attacking the kingside at f6.} 10. f3 exf3 11. gxf3 {If 11.Nxf3 then 11...Bc5 with the intent to exchange the light-squared bishop for the knight if taken to the task.} Bh5 {Maintaining the pin on the weak f-pawn to the queen and striking into White's center.} 12. Qe2+ {Nc3 I suspect was more principled - the Queen check does very little at the moment as it is easily blocked, and it's always dangerous to align your Queen in front of the King.} Be7 {Simply blocking the check and allowing for castling.} 13. Rg1 {Black looks to take over the semi-open g-file, but I feel this may have been premature as the minors are hardly involved. The rook threat is mitigated through simply castling.} O-O 14. Nc3 Re8 {Naturally opposing the Queen on the open file to the King.} 15. Nde4 {White looks to make gains in the center with a pair of connected knights. However, he is walking into a tactical minefield...} Nxe4 {First we remove one of the knights...} 16. Nxe4 Bc5 {And now we have a puzzle-like position -> the f-pawn is pinned to the queen, the knight is pinned to the queen who is indirectly pinned to the king, and the rook is being attacked!} 17. Be3 {White looks to relieve some of the tension and block a pin, however the defender of the formerly pinned knight is also pinned, leaving 17...Rxe4 to continue the assault. 17.Rg3 f5 18.Nxc5 Rxe2+ 19.Kxe2 looks about best for White, but Black still holds the advantage.} Rxe4 {So now... the f-pawn is pinned the queen, the bishop is pinned to the queen and the rook, and the queen is indirectly pinned to the king. } 18. O-O-O {White gives up a piece to get his King to safety.} Rxe3 {A decent move, but perhaps not the best. Also possible was 18...Bxe3+ 19.Kb1. I noticed after that 19...Qf6 intending a mating threat with Bc1, Qxb2 would have taken the White Queen.} 19. Qg2 {White threatens mate with Qxg7, but the threat is parried and another piece brought into the action with Qf6.} Qf6 20. Rde1 {White hopes to exchange, but there is no reason to oblige when all the pieces are coordinating together.} Bxf3 21. Qg3 Rae8 {Now, with doubling the rooks, every piece is involved in the attack.} 22. Kd2 {Technically a mistake, but there's really nothing for white at this point anyway - the threat was to take the rooks off the board and be a bishop pair ahead for an easy win.} Bb4+ 23. c3 {If 23. Kc1 then 23...Rxe1+ 24.Rxe1 Rxe1+ 25. Qxe1+ Bxe1} Bxc3+ {If 24.bxc3 Qxc3#. If 24.Kc1 Bxb2+ 25.Kc2 Qxc3+ (25.Kb1 Be4#) 26.Kb1 Be4#} 24. Kc2 {Mate is coming - it's just a matter of which one.} Be4+ {If 25.Kc1 Bxb2+ 26.Kd1 Qd4#. If 25.Kb3 Qb6+ 26.Ka4 Qb4#} 25. Kd1 Qd4+ 26. Kc1 Bxb2# {}
