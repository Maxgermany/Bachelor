Be2 Qc7 {My Queen controls c3, white has so little space} 12. h3 Ne4 {double check for c3} 13. Bb4 Bxb4 14. axb4 f6 {there is no hurry to add pressure against b5} 15. Bd3 Nd6 {again my dagger is ready for action} 16. Nh2 Qb6 {some pressure to b5} 17. Nc3 Qc7 {hmmm...Na4 -> Nc5 is too strong, so waiting again } 18. Nb1 Bd7 {again with Bishop and Knight will be not so good in a3} 19. Na3 Rfd8 {Good idea to put Rook here, d5 is my weakness} 20. Ng4 h5 {go black go...white Knight , shut the door! } 21. Nh2 g6 22. g4 h4 {the door is now closed with dagger e5} 23. Re1 Kg7 {King releases Ne7 and saves g6 also black squares are much better to stand} 24.
