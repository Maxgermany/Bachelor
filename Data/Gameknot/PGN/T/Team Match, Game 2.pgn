1. e4 {This is a game played in a team match (I annotated both games). I had blundered away the exchange, and was contemplating resigning when a tactical oversight by my opponent gave me a chance to turn the tables over.  Both sides make many mistakes, but overall this was a fun game.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Bc5 {Ruy Lopez - Modern Archangel} 7. Re1 {I seem to have more trouble with white playing c3 and d4 immediately.} O-O 8. h3 {I suppose white was thinking some kind of Anti-Marshal variation.} d6 9. c3 Bb6 10. d4 Re8 11. Bg5 {It is common for white to insert a4 Rb8 axb5 axb5 at some point} h6 12. Bh4 exd4 13. cxd4 g5 {A lot of people (especially in blitz games) automatically take Nxg5 hxg5 Bxg5, which in this particular case is bad because of Bxd4.} 14. Bg3 {I believe black still has a task to equalize here and find ways of dealing with both white's e4-d4 centre, 'spanish' b3 bishop and eliminate weaknesses on c file. Hence I played by a standard plan preparing c5. It seems g4 was better, as white has problems with protecting his d4 pawn.} Na5 15. Bc2 {Here I noticed white was threatening to start a strong attack with e5!, and decided to prevent that by moving my knight to g7, also preparing f5.} Nh5 16. Bh2 Ng7 17. Nc3 c5 {? Bad timing. My pieces are badly placed, and more preparation was needed with moves such as Bb7.} 18. Nd5 Ba7 {? Second mistake in a row. I had to give up my bishop with moves such as Nc6 or Bb7.} 19. dxc5 {I have to lose 2 pawns for nothing, because of 19. ... dxc5 20. Nc7 fork,  19. ... Bxc5 20. b4 fork} Bb7 {The d5 knight is an impressive piece, which is why I exchange it.} 20. cxd6 Bxd5 21. Qxd5 Rc8 {? I must have been completely demoralized at this point.} 22. d7 {:(       What a miserable way to get forked!  On the second thought, Bxf2  22. Kxf2 Rxc2  23. Kg1 Re7 24. Ne5 Ne6 objectively was an improvement for me, compared to previous turn. How come I never saw that variation?} Rxc2 23. dxe8=Q+ Qxe8 24. Bg3 {? After this move, black gets some hopes of activity against white king (and decides not to resign for a few more moves!). In view of what happened in the game, Rf1 was better. } Nh5 25. Kh2 Bxf2 26. Bxf2 Rxf2 27. a4 {? White's second mistake. After 27. Qd4 Rc2 28. Rc1, black's hopes are crushed. (27. Nxg5 does not work due to the same combination as in the game)} Rxg2+ {!} 28. Kh1 {It seems black is regaining his piece in all variations, so white should have considered 28. Kxg2 Nf4  29. Kh1 Nxd5 30. exd5, which, at least is not too bad for white.} Qc8 29. Ng1 Qc2 30. Qd8+ {? It's black's turn to be demoralized by the flip of the board. The Queen was needed for protecting e4, and the a5 knight does not matter. Necessary was 30. Ne2 Rxe2 31. Rxe2 Qxe2} Kh7 31. Ne2 Qxe4 32. Qd4 {Only defence -- but white is now offering his queen for less than a knight and rook: 32. ... Ng3  33. Nxg3 Qxd4 34. Kxg2 Qxb2  However, I thought I had a faster way of winning than fighting with queen and a couple of extra pawns against two rooks.} Qa8 33. Qd3+ Kg8 34. Red1 {Again, the only move.} Rxe2+ 35. Qd5 Qxd5+ 36. Rxd5 Nc4 {Setting up a specific trap, and white falls into it.} 37. axb5 {Rg1 was necessary.} Ne3 {? A bad case of transposing moves. 37. ... Ng3  38. Kg1 Ne3 - Rg2 mate is the sequence I was thinking of, but now white can save his king (temporarily) once again by 37. Rd8  Kg2 38. Rg1.} 38. Rd8+ Kg7 39. Kg1 {? Resigned because of forced 39. ... Rg2  40. Kh1 Ng3 checkmate. After 39. Rg1, I'd have to work some more getting my knight to f3, or if that failed, simply advancing the extra pawns.  Feel free to comment on the game and point out mistakes in my variations. Thanks!}
