[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 {The King's Pawn opening. This is my normal opening move as white. I learned this move at a chess club at high school when I was 14, as it frees the queen and light-square bishop.} d5 {Scandinavian defence. My opponent is obviously looking to develop his queen should I capture his pawn...} 2. exd5 {...which is exactly what I do, transposing to the Lasker variation. I couldn't resist here, as I do like to create space to give my pieces more freedom...} Qxd5 {...but it prompts him to bring out his queen into the centre of the board to get ahead in development, keeping with the Lasker variation...} 3. Qf3 {...so I bring out mine to contest the long light diagonal. The first time I remember this in a mini-tournament game, my opponent captured my queen, allowing my knight to come out and recapture...} Qe5+ {...but she doesn't capture her just yet, she moves across to check my king...} 4. Qe3 {...so I put mine in front of him to keep chasing her around...} Qxe3+ {...and this time she captures her, making me think "which pawn to I use to recapture?"...} 5. dxe3 {...and I decide to use my queen's pawn to keep a more even connection on both sides.} Bf5 {This series of moves allowed him to develop his bishop...} 6. Bd3 {...so I develop mine to contest the b1-h7 diagonal...} Bxd3 7. cxd3 {...forcing an exchange. I have two connected pawns on one side of the hole, and five on the other. Was he inviting these exchanges?} Nc6 {He now develops his knight...} 8. Nf3 {...so I do the same...} O-O-O {...and as he castles queenside, his rooks are now four squares apart, so my knight is eyeing up the f7 square, hoping to win a rook.} 9. Ng5 {So I advance my knight to the 5th rank to attack the f7 square. There was one snag: his knight can cover by moving to h6, and my pawn on e3 is blocking the bishop's path...} Nh6 {...so he does the expected move, covering the f7 square with his knight.} 10. O-O {What was I doing castling kingside, when my pawn on d3 was under attack from my rook?} Rxd3 {He captures it, as I expected. Now I'm in trouble here, with an enemy rook on my 3rd rank.} 11. Nc3 {Was I panicking here? I move out my knight to develop a piece on my third rank, but I had no idea what to do next.} e6 12. Nce4 {I've now connected my knights. I have more control of the centre than I did previously, but am devoid of what to do next...} f5 {...as that pawn can easily deal with their threat...} 13. Ng3 {...so my second knight retreats to the only safe place, where it is not under attack from any piece.} e5 14. e4 f4 {My knight is in trouble again. So it needs to move. It would have probably have been better to retreat it...} 15. Nf5 {...but I move it forwards onto a square under attack from his knight...} Nxf5 16. exf5 {...forcing an exchange. This was not what I wanted, being behind on material.} Be7 17. Ne4 {I must retreat my knight here, as attacking the rook would force it to move.} Nd4 {His remaining knight is coming at me. It is no doubt looking to forking my king and bishop...} 18. Bd2 {...so I move up my bishop to prevent it from happening...} Nxf5 {...but I lose another pawn. I'm in trouble here.} 19. Bc3 {I move my bishop in an attempt to win a pawn back...} Rd5 {...but the rook moves back to cover it...} 20. Rad1 {...so I bring out one of mine to contest the d-file, no doubt to remove the rook cover...} c6 {...so he covers his rook with his pawn...} 21. Rxd5 cxd5 {...but why did I exchange rooks here? All it did was places my knight is in trouble...} 22. Nd2 {...so it must retreat again...} d4 {...and now my bishop is about to disappear, as moving it to a5 would prompt him to move his pawn to b6...} 23. Bxd4 {...so I capture a pawn...} exd4 {...before dropping my bishop.} 24. a3 Kd7 25. Nc4 {I move my knight as a touch of defiance, being a pawn and piece behind...} Rc8 26. Ne5+ {...and check the king with it...} Ke6 27. Re1 {...and put my rook behind it, hoping that his king would stay put...} Kd5 {...but he moves him...} 28. Nd3 {...so I move my knight back, eyeing up the pawn on f4...} Bd6 {...but the bishop covers it...} 29. g3 {...so I attack it with my pawn...} f3 {...but it advances, blocking off my king's escape rout from his starting rank.} 30. h4 Rc2 {I'm in big trouble now, with his rook on my 2nd rank. I must try to drive it away...} 31. Rd1 {...but this was not the way to do it. I must not trade rooks, as I am down on material, but I wasted a move here.} Ke4 32. Kh2 Ne3 33. Re1 Kxd3 {I resign here, as I am now down by two pieces and a pawn, and the only bottom-rank piece I have left is a rook. He also had a rook, but he also had a knight and bishop, plus an extra pawn.}
