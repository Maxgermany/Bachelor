[Opening "Queen's Indian (E15), Nimzovich variation (exaggerated fianchetto)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 {A standard position of the Queen's Indian.  I checked my opponent's game history and she plays the Queen's Indian with some regularity.} 5. b3 {This seemed the most solid reply.  But 5. Qa4 is certainly possible, too.  But I decided in favor of 5. b3 because it maximizes the misplacement of Black queen's bishop on a6.} Bd6 {I have never seen the Black king's bishop placed here before, and I saw no game of my opponent where she made this move. It prevents the freeing move ....d5, but it allows the Black queen some freedom to go to e7 and later dictate some pawn moves in the center.} 6. Bg2 Nc6 7. O-O O-O 8. Bb2 Qe7 9. Ne5 Bb7 10. Nxc6 {The computer recommended 10. e4 Bxe5 11. dxe5 Ne8 12. Nd2 d6 13. exd6 cxd6 14. Nf3 Nf6 15. Qe2 Rac8 16. Rad1 Nb4 17. Bxf6 gxf6 with a slight edge to White. But my motive for 10. Nxc6 was simply to double the c-pawns, which I expected to exploit later. I think this turned out to be the right strategy, and it kept me from losing the game later.} Bxc6 11. Bxc6 dxc6 12. Qc2 e5 13. c5 {This is a temporary pawn sac designed to expose the double pawns to my queen and rooks later.} bxc5 14. dxc5 Bxc5 15. Rc1 Bd4 16. Ba3 {I did not want to play 16. Bxd4 since it would expose my backward king's pawn and give Black a possible passer later on d4.} Qe6 17. Bxf8 Rxf8 {The computer now rates this position as -0.68, being favorable to Black. This rating will definitely worsen against me over time.} 18. Nc3 Qh3 {I completely overlooked this move. In short order the Black knight will make mincemeat of my kingside.} 19. e3 Bxc3 20. Qxc3 Ng4 21. Rc2 Qxh2+ 22. Kf1 e4 23. Qd4 {I consider this my strongest move in this position, because it keeps the Black rook out of action on the d-file.  However, the computer now rates this position -1.51 against me.} Qh3+ 24. Ke2 Nxf2 25. Rg1 Qf5 26. Rf1 Qf3+ 27. Kd2 Qg2 28. Rxf2 Qxf2+ 29. Kc3 {My king will develop into my most valuable fighting piece. Believe it or not, my king will end up back on the king side eventually.} Qxg3 30. Qxe4 Rd8 31. Kb2 h5 32. Qf4 {I hated to trade queens.  But I saw no easy way to prevent the Black horde of connected king side pawns, unless I got at least one pawn in front of them. The queen exchange accomplishes that. The computer now rates this position as -3.38 against me.  But we are only halfway through this game, believe it or not.} Qxf4 33. exf4 Rd5 34. Rh2 g6 35. Kc3 Kh7 36. b4 {I might as well advance these queen side pawns.  They will turn out to be the only advantage I have in this game.} Rf5 {I was a bit surprised by this move.  Is Black letting my king back over into the king side?} 37. Rh4 Kh6 38. Kd3 g5 39. fxg5+ Kxg5 40. Rc4 c5 41. b5 Rd5+ {This is a bit of a mistake, since my king can now enter the action on the king side.  The computer prefers 41...h4 42. Rc2 h3 43. Re2 Kf4 44. Rf2+ Kg4 45. Re2.} 42. Ke3 h4 43. Kf3 f5 44. a4 {The computer prefers 44. Ra4 Rd3+ 45. Kg2 f4 46. Rxa7 f3+ 47. Kf2 Kf4 48. Rxc7 Rd2+ 49. Kg1 Rg2+ 50. Kh1 Rxa2 51. Rf7+ Kg3 52. Rg7+ Kh3 53. Kg1 Rb2 54. Kf1.  Still a losing position, of course.} f4 45. a5 h3 46. a6 {The computer calls this a mistake.  With best play (starting 46. Rc2 Kf5 47. Rc1 Rd3+ 48. Ke2 c4 49. Kf2 Rd2+ 50. Kg1 f3 51. Rxc4 Rd1+ 52. Kf2 h2 53. Rh4 h1=Q 54. Rxh1 Rxh1 55. Kxf3), I would be down only -5.83.  In short, this is hopeless. But hang in there. It gets worse, and then better.} Re5 47. Rc2 Kf5 48. Rc1 Rd5 49. Rc2 Rd3+ 50. Kf2 {The computer also calls this a mistake.  But the best alternative it gives (50. Ke2 h2 51. Rc1 Ke4 52. Rh1 Ra3 53. Kd2 c4) is just as dismal. The computer now rates this position -8.75 against me. } Kg4 51. Rxc5 Rd1 52. Rxc7 Rd2+ 53. Kg1 h2+ 54. Kh1 f3 55. Rxa7 f2 56. Rf7 {The computer does not like this move much. Bur all variations that I see now come down to what actually happens here in this position.} Rd1+ 57. Kxh2 f1=Q 58. Rxf1 Rxf1 59. a7 {And just like that, Black has a host of problems now to deal with.  The only advantage Black has is with the rook being sufficient to deliver mate, but that happens only if Black can pin my king to the edge of the board and then place the rook at a distance in order to mate.  Note that Reuben Fine, in his classic work "Basic Chess Endings," refers to endings with 2 connected passed pawns versus rook, in the absence of kings, as being a win only if the pawns are both on the sixth rank, but otherwise lose.  Here, the pawns are in a position to win outright, but only if my king can avoid the non-stop checks by the rook and also the chance of being mated.  See diagram 291 (Keres-Eliskases, Noordwijk 1938) as the typical drawing example.  Fine summarizes it: "When the King of the Pawns is on or near the edge of the board, the threat of checkmate may often be an adequate defense against two pawns on the sixth and seventh, while if both pawns are on the sixth, or one is on the seventh and the other on the fifth, the Rook may even win."} Rf2+ 60. Kg1 Ra2 61. b6 Kf3 62. b7 {Of course! Black cannot prevent both pawns from queening.  But Black does have a drawing trick.} Ra1+ 63. Kh2 Ra2+ 64. Kg1 {Here is the trick.  The only way I can prevent a threefold repetition of the same position that is created by the perpetual checks is to hide behind the Black king.  But see what happens if I try 64. Kh3:  64...Rxa7!! 65. b8=Q Rh7++.  A good game, with lots of mistakes, close shaves, and me staring down the barrel of defeat most of the way.} Ra1+ 65. Kh2 Ra2+ 66. Kh1 Ra1+ 67. Kh2 Ra2+ {}
