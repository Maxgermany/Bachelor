1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Qf3 Nc6 4. c3 d6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. d3 Be7 8. h3 O-O 9. Bg5 d5 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. g3 dxe4 12. Qe3 {Not the best move on White's part. White could have recaptured with the pawn without fear of being taken again by the bishop. Although it does open up a path for my Queen, nothing would really come of that because White's back rank is still too well-protected.} Bg5 13. f4 exf4 14. gxf4 Bh4+ 15. Kd2 Bb5 16. Qxe4 {Not a smart move for White. I still have the advantage, as you'll see in the following few moves.} Bxd3 {Taking the pawn} 17. Qe3 Be4+ {Black's rook is dead.} 18. Kc1 Bxh1 19. Nf3 {White tries to block my Rook from retreating back to my side of the board.} Bg2 20. b4 Bxh3 {I take the pawn} 21. a4 Re8 22. Ne5 Bf5 23. Nd2 Qd5 24. c4 Qh1+ 25. Kb2 Qh2 26. Rd1 Bf6 27. Kb3 Rad8 28. Qxa7 {Not a smart move for white. Now the queen can't intervene when I begin to mate.} Bxe5 29. fxe5 {The knight was one big obstacle here in preventing a mate, so I got rid of it.} Rd3+ {Thus begins my forced mate.} 30. Kc2 Rxd2+ 31. Kc1 Rxd1+ 32. Kxd1 {Exchange of rooks.} Qc2+ 33. Ke1 {Only move.} Rxe5+ 34. Kf1 {Only move.} Bh3+ 35. Kg1 {Only move.} Re1# {Mate. }
