1. f4 {I wanted to show how the kings gambit provides lots of tactical play for both sides. If you are interested in perfect chess, then this is probably not for you, as this game has mistakes from both sides and the kings gambit is probably not safest opening for white either. I do not normally play Birds opening, this game game is part of a mini tournament that has the opening moves f4 e5 (Froms Gambit). } e5 2. e4 {Not often one can transpose into a kings gambit !} exf4 {Kings Gambit, my favourite playing white or black.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. d4 {One of the main ideas of the kings gambit is to provide good central pawns for white.} Qf6 {Interesting move, my first thought was that surely bringing out the queen here would let me gain more useful tempi, but in hindsight I cannot really see anything really wrong with this move.} 5. e5 {This move was made almost by instinct, there just something about a humble pawn attacking the queen.} Qg6 6. Kf2 {Ok, I admit this probably not the best move, there were two reasons for it. Firstly I wanted to avoid a potential pin happening for my knight going to c3, secondly I wanted to avoid the queen check on e4. } Qf5 {I was not sure what my opponent was trying to achieve here, I saw it as a wasted tempo, which in the kings gambit is the last thing one should be doing.} 7. Bd3 Qg4 8. Re1 {I am almost doing castling in slow motion here.} Be7 9. Kg1 {Forced by a B h4 } Bb4 {Another wasted tempo by black, I also was not sure about the intent of this move.} 10. c3 Be7 11. Re4 {A computer will show that this move is not a good move. The best move would have been h3 and the queen must move to e6, if she moves to g6, then she will end up getting trapped. My reasoning behind this move was to that if black played g5, then there would not be many squares for the black queen to move to leading to a fork or queen trap.} g5 12. h3 Qe6 13. c4 {My intention is obvious.} Qh6 {There was always one annoying square the the black queen could escape to.} 14. Nc3 f5 15. exf6 e.p. {Should not have done this, this gives black more space and allow free development of a piece, R e1 is better.} Nxf6 16. Re2 Qg7 {Yet another Queen move, clearly planning a pawn storm on my king.} 17. a3 {A passive move, If one plays the Kings gambit one can hardly afford to play passively. I played it because I did not like Nb4, I wanted to keep my light squared bishop for action on the black king side.} h5 {Time wise the game was relatively quick, the most time spent thinking was on this move. White can now no longer afford any passive move anymore, Black has a pawn phalanx marching straight toward the king, backed by a queen and a rook. White on the other hand has a rook targeting the pinned bishop, with good central pawns. My initial thought was that Black has the better attack and I should defend, but this being a kings gambit game and because I was a pawn down I decided to throw caution in to the wind.} 18. d5 g4 19. Nh4 {The only move, the knight on f5 will threaten the queen and the pinned bishop.} f3 {Not a good idea for white to take this pawn ;)} 20. Nf5 Qg8 {I think Qf8 is better, since it will stop Nh6.} 21. dxc6 {Another bad move by me, Re1 would have maintained the pin, saved my rook and black would still have to lost a piece.} fxe2 22. Qxe2 {Now the pin on the bishop faces an even greater threat.} Rh7 {If the black queen tries to protect the bishop, then Bg5 will create bigger problems for black.} 23. Nh6 {Will trade back my rook I lost for a minor piece earlier. The computer shows that this move leads to an about equal game, Nb5 would have given white a much better advantage and keeps up the pressure.} Rxh6 24. Bxh6 gxh3 25. Re1 {I was convinced that black would play Qxg2 here, leading to an equal game.} Qe6 {A big mistake by black, this loses the game, the queen and rook on the e file are way too deadly. I assume that black expected Q x Q, d X Q, going to a drawn endgame.} 26. cxd7+ {Black might have missed this when he play Qe6.} Qxd7 27. Bf5 {More queen chasing like earlier in the game, but this time it is much deadlier.} Qd4+ {The problem is that after the checks run out the queen will have to go back and defend the bishop.} 28. Kh1 Qc5 29. b4 {Yip, I love chasing queens with my pawn.} hxg2+ 30. Kxg2 Qc6+ 31. Kg1 {Not Kf1 otherwise Qh1 } Qd6 32. Bg6+ Kd8 33. Rd1 {And now the Black queen finally has nowhere to run.  I will not comment on the rest of the game. Both sides made mistakes, but hopefully it show how the kings gambit provides both sides lots of tactical playing opportunity and that kings gambit games are not often boring.} Bg4 34. Rxd6+ cxd6 35. Qg2 Rc8 36. Bd3 Rc6 37. Nd5 Nxd5 38. Qxd5 Kd7 39. Bf5+ Bxf5 40. Qxf5+ Kd8 41. Qd5 Ra6 42. Bc1 Rc6 43. Kg2 a6 44. Bf4 Kd7 45. a4 b6 46. Kf3 h4 47. Kg4 Rc7 48. Be3 Rc6 49. b5 axb5 50. axb5 Rc5 51.
