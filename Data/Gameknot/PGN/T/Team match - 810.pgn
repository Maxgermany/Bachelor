1. e4 {Again, annotation for team benefit...} d5 2. exd5 Bf5 3. Bb5+ {Slightly crazy opening, just begging for sharp tactical combinations somewhere.} c6 4. dxc6 bxc6 5. Qf3 Qc8 {Defends the f5 bishop and the c6 pawn, but ties the queen to an unpleasant early defensive duty.} 6. Ba4 {Defending the c2 pawn} Nf6 7. c3 {looks slow, but was designed to play d4 and hold the middle whilst giving the freedom for the a4 bishop to move. In hindsight, this seems unnecessary.} e6 8. d4 Be7 9. Bg5 {complicated play really - designed to pin the knight whilst opening up the position. My only target at this point was rook mobility.} Be4 {Risky play. This is defended by a pinned piece, but this is ok at the moment} 10. Qg3 Qb7 {now I had genuine concerns of the risks after black plays c5. The pressure on g2 is becoming very difficult to hold, especially after I lose a tempo to defend b2.} 11. b3 Nbd7 12. Nd2 {Making use of the non pressure of Nb-d7 to develop further and release the a1 rook. This has the hidden threat of making the knight pin critical.} Nb6 {Black does not spot the knight pin threat, and loses material.} 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Nxe4 {gaining material, this leaves a big threat of the Queen fork on Nd6 } Nxa4 {which fortunately wasn't spotted...} 15. Nd6+ Kd7 16. Nxb7 {The game is now as good as over - analysis ends.} Rhg8 17. Qd6+ Kc8 18. Qxc6+ Kb8 19. Nd6 Nc5 20. Qxc5 Be7 21. Qc6 Bxd6 22. Qxd6+ Kb7 23. Nf3 Rac8 24. O-O Rxc3 25. Qb4+ Ka6 {}
