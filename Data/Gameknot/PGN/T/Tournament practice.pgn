[Opening "Queen's pawn game (E10)"]

1. d4 {This is the 4th move in my options. It is good and bad to not stick with one opening, I just wanted to change it up.} Nf6 {Im trying still to play something different. I have to know what to do in all sorts of openings.} 2. c4 e6 {I was going to follow up with 3. ...d5, witch I do, but the issue with playing yourself is that you always know everything coming, and all the plans. } 3. Nf3 {I almost have control of every center square, and especially E5 } d5 {See, I do know what I'm thinking. The best options in this situation are 4. b3, and 4. e3, and, If your not me, you might include Ne5. } 4. e3 {Because we both have our E- pawns 1 square forward, and our knights next, the focus is actually on the queenside} dxc4 5. Bxc4 {Now white is totally ahead} Bd6 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Nb5 {We are now out of the opening.} Ne4 {Ne4 didn't really have a point to it. It changes the board alot in 2 moves, but it's not really because of the knight} 8. Qc2 f5 {That is how the position changed} 9. a3 {To protect Bb4+} c6 10. Nxd6 Nxd6 {At this point, who do you think is winning?} 11. Bd2 {I would say white is ahead, } Nd7 {This game is one very good one of mine. The Knight Is obviously going to F6} 12. Bb4 {Do you see the power in this move? The bishop can Capture D6, and... wait, Why didn't I play Bxe6+? Well, I suppose it's a blunder, but, my point earlier was that if the rook wasn't there (f8), 12. ...Qc7, 13. Bxd6 would win a pawn on f5} c5 {I REALLY think missing that rook was a big issue. I gave up a pawn because of it. } 13. Bxc5 Nxc5 14. dxc5 Nf7 {Now the middle has changed up a bit} 15. Nd4 Qa5+ 16. b4 {That was the best, and I think only way to stop Qxc5} Qc7 {There won't be much more notation for a while, because this is a 75 move game} 17. O-O-O Bd7 18. Bb5 Rfe8 19. Bxd7 Qxd7 20. Ne2 Qb5 21. Nc3 Qa6 22. Kb2 Rad8 23. Rd2 Re7 24. Rxd8+ Nxd8 25. Rd1 Nf7 26. b5 Qa5 27. c6 bxc6 28. bxc6 Rc7 29. Na2 Qb5+ 30. Nb4 Qe5+ 31. Qc3 Qxc3+ 32. Kxc3 Ne5 33. Rd8+ Kf7 34. Kb3 Nxc6 35. Nxc6 Rxc6 36. Rd7+ Kf6 37. Rxa7 Rb6+ 38. Ka4 Rc6 39. Kb5 Rc8 40. a4 Rb8+ 41. Kc6 Rb2 42. a5 Rxf2 43. a6 Rxg2 44. Rb7 {Yeah, He's goona promote} Rc2+ 45. Kb6 Rb2+ 46. Ka7 Rd2 47. Kb8 Rd8+ 48. Kc7 Ra8 49. a7 Ke5 50. Kb6 Kd6 {As I said, this game goes on for about 75 moves, but most people here would resign.  1-0 W: 7:14 B:7:39      It was a pretty nice game I played.}
