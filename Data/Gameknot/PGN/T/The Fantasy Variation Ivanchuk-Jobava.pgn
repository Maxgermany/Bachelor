1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. f3 Qb6 {Very rare. The main line is 3...e6 4. Nc3 Bb4.} 4. a3 {!? A novelty. Ivanchuk probably wanted to prevent a future Qb4+, threatening his d4 pawn, though this is quite modest. So much for theory!} e5 {!?!? This move releases the tension in the centre a little too early. However, Black does want to play aggressively and develop his pieces quickly too. The normal verdict of this move would probably be unclear.} 5. exd5 Nf6 {?! Now this is really unjustified. The normal 5...cxd5 6. c3 Nc6 gives Black a tenable game. But now the action starts...} 6. dxe5 {! A brave move. Ivanchuk must have been really confident that he could resist Black's attack, develop his own pieces, AND gain a little material ?!?} Bc5 {?! It seems logical to stake out this plan if Black played 5...Nf6, but the calm and normal-looking 6...Nxd5! is the best move, after which the chances are equal.} 7. exf6 {!!! A REALLY GREAT move! Ivanchuk's play MUST be unsound, since he is neglecting development and ALLOWING Black to attack him?? He must have been awfully sure...} Bf2+ 8. Ke2 O-O {O.K, Black MUST be winning. Ivanchuk STILL hasn't even developed ONE piece, and his king is stuck in the centre to a big attack. However, Ivanchuk has a material advantage. The only question is whether he can keep it or not...} 9. Qd2 Re8+ {? On principle, this decision looks quite odd. It isn't so much the material issue of two pieces and rook for the queen (and chaos on the board still), but the fact that black will trade off two developed pieces for the queen, with no immediate way to aggressively sustain the initiative. -CB.} 10. Kd1 Re1+ {Not the best continuation. More promising is 10...Bxg1 11.fxg7 Bf5 12.g4 Bg6.} 11. Qxe1 Bxe1 12. Kxe1 Bf5 13. Be2 {White must try to defend himself against the attack and if he succeeds he should win. For Black, he must try to weave a mating net or attack and get some material, which should be sufficient to win the game.} Nd7 {13...Bxc2 14. Nc3 Nd7 was also possible.} 14. dxc6 bxc6 15. Bd1 Re8+ 16. Ne2 Nxf6 17. Nbc3 {In terms of piece play alone, it is hard to see how black can increase pressure. He opts to reroute the bishop to a6, but perhaps it won't really change all that much. Possibly black had to try and figure a way to soften the kingside up with the pawns and pieces, while keeping White tied up in the center. Whether or not that is even possible is hard to judge of course, but as it stands, Black's initiative is slowly disappearing.-CB} Bc8 {17...Nd5 18.Nxd5 cxd5 is possible.} 18. a4 a5 19. Rf1 Ba6 20. Rf2 h5 21. Ra3 h4 22. g3 h3 23. g4 Rd8 {Worth attention is 23...Bc4 24.g5 Nd5.} 24. Nf4 Nd7 25. Rb3 {Now White has defended himself successfully and Black can resign. I will not do much more notes for the next moves.} Qd4 26. Nfe2 Re8 27. Ne4 Qxa4 28. Bd2 {It is rather silly-looking that White has arranged his pieces passively but he has defended incredibly.} Qa1 29. Bc3 Ne5 30. Ra3 Qb1 31. Nd2 Qc1 32. Rxa5 Ng6 {Desperation.} 33. Rxa6 Nf4 34. Ra8 {!!!!!! A lovely finish. Black cannot take with the rook because White can take the queen with the knight. If Black checks, then after34...Ng2+ 35.Rxg2 Rxa8 36.Nxc1 hxg2 37.Kf2 Ra1 38.Ndb3 Ra8 39.Kxg2 Rd8 40. Nd3 Rc8 41.Nbc5 Kf8 42.Ne4 Rc7 43.Bb4+ Kg8 44.Be2 Rc8 45.Kg3 f6 46.Bc5 White has a decisive advantage. A dazzling game by Ivanchuk. Hoped you enjoyed this.}
