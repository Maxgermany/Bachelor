1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Not a fan of this, but some are, but have to deal with it before it becomes a problem.} a6 4. Ba4 {Capture would be stronger as it allows me to develpe.  Also a second bishop move in the first 4 moves.} b5 {Gain some queen side space as well as force the bishop to move again.} 5. Bb3 Nf6 6. O-O Bc5 7. h3 O-O 8. d3 h6 {Have to do this for defence as the bishop on c1 can pin my knight.} 9. Re1 d6 10. Bd2 Be6 {Open the f file with a capture or the d file with no capture as I would own d 5 3times to my opponent twice.} 11. Bxe6 {I never capture here as it opens up a file for me.  If I captured instead it would open up the a file for my opponent.} fxe6 12. a3 {Should develpe the knight to prevent d 5} d5 13. Nc3 Nd4 {Brain cramp on my part as I leave the e5 pawn undefended.} 14. Nxe5 {And a good move spoting it.} Qe8 {Have to play a bit of defence as the knight can cause problems.} 15. Be3 Bb6 16. Ne2 {Gives me a way out of my bad move earlier as I capture with check.} Nxe2+ 17. Qxe2 d4 18. Bd2 c5 19. c3 Bc7 20. f4 Nh5 21. cxd4 cxd4 {3 pawn islands with this move, but have more space on the board.} 22. Bb4 {This move allows me to trade a rook for a bishop, knight and pawn.} Nxf4 23. Qf3 Bxe5 24. Bxf8 Qxf8 25. Rac1 {Garbing the open file which is good.} Qe7 26. Red1 Rf8 {ready for a suprise discovery with this move.} 27. Qg4 Qg5 {Going for a trade as I have a material advandtage going into the end game.} 28. Rd2 {And good move to protect against the upcoming fork if queens get traded.} Ne2+ {But since they are both on the board, this spells the end with a sacrifice.} 29. Qxe2 Qg3 {Now nothing can stop mate with out major loss.} 30. Qf3 Rxf3 31. Rf2 Qxf2+ 32. Kh1 Rxh3+ {and a nice rook sacrifice to finsh it.} 33. gxh3 Qh2# {There it is.  I hope some on the team can add some more comments to help out Jerry as his game is getting stronger but I do know others on the team can add more info to help him out.  Thanks!!}
