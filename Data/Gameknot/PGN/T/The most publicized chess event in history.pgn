1. Nf3 {Garry Kasparov tries accumulating small advantages without risking anything during this War.  Deep Blue seemed a little confused at first and played a few innacurate and weakening moves, but it came right back into the game with later moves that no one would have foreseen.  Kasparov kept his nerve, and still held a small advantage.  However the lead, Kasparov muttered to himself after not making the best move.  With the tension rising, Deep Blue was provoked into an unsound attack that weakened its position still further, but such was the ferocity of its assault that it took all of Kasparov's tactical skill to defeat the computer.  Although ahead on material, Deep Blue was strategically lost after the queens were exchanged and the world champion methodically wrapped up the endgame.  Hope you have fun looking through this game, I will be showing Game 2 between Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue tommorow.  They played a 6 game series of flawless playing. } d5 {After Kasparov plays the Reti Opening, the Computer (One of the smartest in the World) Deep Blue starts out with Queens pawn to d5.  This is a normal continuation after the Reti Opening.} 2. g3 {Kasparov plays g3 which is also known as the Tennison Gambit.  This also sets up a Kings Indian Attack.} Bg4 3. b3 Nd7 {A questionable move.  Here I would have played pawn to e6 or Nc6.} 4. Bb2 e6 {Deep Blue looks for a Queen side attack, and to hold Kasparov to his home defense (nothing past the 3rd row) by taking control of the center.} 5. Bg2 {Kasparov sets up for a King side fianchetto.  Many players use this but it has many strengths and weaknesses.} Ngf6 {Deep Blue continues to reinforce his center control.} 6. O-O {Kingside Fianchetto.} c6 7. d3 {Kasparov's pawn advancement is very slow but also very effective.  While on the other side, Deep Blue tries to advance as much as it can to try to control the board.} Bd6 8. Nbd2 {Kasparov plays this game very carefully, trying not to make many mistakes.  I really like Kasparov's playing as it is risk free and most what flawless.} O-O {Deep Blue takes the time to castle and better defend his King.  } 9. h3 {Deep Blue is finally forced to either sacrafice his bishop for Kasparov's knight, or retreat a little farther back.} Bh5 {As many great chess players do, he retreats but still is in a attacking position on Kasparov's knight.  Many times white would then play g4 which would even further attack black's bishop on h5, forcing black to move his bishop back to g6. } 10. e3 {Again, Kasparov's slow but effective pawn advancement.  Didn't want to play e4, as he wanted to hold back on sacraficing pawns and position.} h6 11. Qe1 Qa5 {Deep Blue brings its Queen out to get in a better attacking position.  So far, black has been on the attack the whole game, as white just sits back and creates a strong defense.} 12. a3 Bc7 13. Nh4 g5 {Deep Blue attacks Kasparov's knight on h4, by playing g5.  This however, wasnt a bad move, but will cost him towards the end as it loses all defense for whites future King side pawn rush.} 14. Nhf3 e5 {Deep Blue continues to advance its lines towards the center.} 15. e4 {Kasparov finally decides to break up blacks center control.} Rfe8 16. Nh2 {Still very conservative playing by Kasparov as he refuses to make any errors.} Qb6 17. Qc1 a5 {Black continues to advance.} 18. Re1 Bd6 19. Ndf1 dxe4 {Alas, the first damage has been struck and the War has begun.} 20. dxe4 Bc5 {Looking for an attack on f3 (Bxf3 ....Kh1), Deep Blue moves his bishop into great position on c5.} 21. Ne3 {Kasparov continues to play solid and defends.  } Rad8 22. Nhf1 g4 {Deep Blue making his attack on whites King's defense.} 23. hxg4 Nxg4 {They sacrafice.} 24. f3 Nxe3 25. Nxe3 Be7 {Still in it, Deep blue retreats his attack on whites right wing.} 26. Kh1 {Now Kasparov can move his knight on e3, without being in check.} Bg5 {Whoa, Deep Blue decides to attack whites knight once more from a different angle.} 27. Re2 a4 28. b4 {Kasparov could have taken blacks pawn on a4 (bxa4) and not be harmed, but then this piece would be defenseless in later moves, and create and opening on whites Queen side.} f5 {Deep Blue still attacking whites King side plays f5.  Deep Blue so far has been the more agressive player, but he has attacked with the wrong pieces, as he is losing his pawn defense for his King.  If Kasparov does decide to accept this attack (exf5), Deep Blue would be able to advance his pawn onto e4.} 29. exf5 e4 {You can already start to see Kasparov's Kingside pawn rush coming into play.} 30. f4 {White looks to sacrafice his for blacks bishop, and to clear way for his future attack.} Bxe2 {Black accepts.} 31. fxg5 Ne5 {Black doesn't wish to break up this attack by playing hxg5, but continues its strong attack on whites King.} 32. g6 {The rush has begun, and now there seems to be nothing stopping Kasparov from winning game 1.} Bf3 {Still looking for a way out by trying to checkmate Kasparov, Deep Blue plays Bishop to f3.} 33. Bc3 {Kasparov is willing to sacrafice bishops though.} Qb5 34. Qf1 {Here, Kasparov tries to eliminate Deep Blues only lasting threat by Sacraficing Queens.} Qxf1+ 35. Rxf1 h5 {Looking to make a final blow to whites defense.} 36. Kg1 Kf8 37. Bh3 b5 38. Kf2 Kg7 39. g4 Kh6 40. Rg1 hxg4 41. Bxg4 Bxg4 42. Nxg4+ Nxg4+ 43. Rxg4 {Now, much of the smoke has cleared on the battle field and you can see that nothing is stopping Kasparov from regaining his Queen to win.} Rd5 44. f6 Rd1 45. g7 {And there it is.  After Deep Blue's next move, Kasparov will either play 46. f7...Rd8 47. g8=Queen, or he will just settle for a rook advantage by playing 46. g8...Rxg8 47. Rxg8.  He most likely would have taken the Queen and won the game anyway.  Deep Blue realizes it has no hope of winning this game and resigns.  What a great game and a great stradegy by Kasparov.  Holding back and not making any mistakes whatsoever.  If you liked this classic battle between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov, I will guarantee you that you will love the ones to come.}
