[Opening "QGD Slav defence, Alekhine variation (D10)"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 {I start with the queen's gambit, my usual} c6 {Slav defense} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 {Nothing new} Bf5 5. Bg5 Ne4 {?! Never move a piece twice in the opening} 6. Nxe4 {I couldn't let him have that outpost.} Bxe4 7. e3 {I now have a pretty normal queen's gambit pawn structure.} Nd7 8. Bd3 Bxf3 {?! Not only does this trade a bishop for a knight, it allows me to develop me queen.} 9. Qxf3 {White is obviously better here. He has all his minor pieces and his queen developed to nice squares, (With the possible exception of my DSB.) and he has a healthy pawn structure.} f6 {????? Looks like it is nothing more than an inaccuracy or possibly a mistake as it weakens the light squares... But} 10. Qh5+ {Whaaaaaam} g6 11. Bxg6+ {Now, I could have played Qxg6, and it would have worked just as well, but I didn't think of it.} hxg6 12. Qxg6# {Aaaaaaaaaaand MATE I don't usually get to get checkmates like this, so I had to annotate it. Please drop a comment and rate.}
