[Opening "Centre game, Kieseritsky variation (C21)"]

1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 {The Center Game, a very old-fashioned opening. White either loses time recapturing or has to play a kind of gambit.} 3. Nf3 Bc5 {3... N-QB3 seems more natural. } 4. Bc4 Nc6 5. c3 {Definitely a gambit now, as White offers the Pawn exchange locking in Black's material gain in return for a quick, provocative attack.} dxc3 {Black is a man of honor: he must accept the gambit.} 6. Bxf7+ {Very risky. White was apparently in a tactical, attacking mood.} Kxf7 7. Qd5+ {Wins back the piece.} Kf8 8. Qxc5+ d6 9. Qxc3 {White has equalized the material.} Qe8 10. O-O Qxe4 {Now Black is pressing forward. He regains the material advantage.} 11. Re1 Qg6 12. Qb3 Nf6 13. Nc3 {White is down a Pawn, but Black's exposed K position and immobile KR are weaknesses. It's hard to tell who has the advantage.} h6 14. Be3 Bg4 {Both men complete their development, clearing the last minor pieces off the first rank.} 15. Nh4 Qh5 16. Qxb7 {Black had overlooked this fork, which wins a piece and gives White the material edge... momentarily.} Rb8 17. Qxc6 {White thinks he's just won a piece, but he in turn had overlooked...} Qxh4 {...this capture.} 18. Qxc7 Rxb2 {In his eagerness to snatch back the Pawn, Black leaves his first rank undefended.} 19. Qc8+ Kf7 20. Qxh8 {White pounces, winning the Rook. In turn, he has to be careful not to get his Q trapped on the 8th rank.} Bd7 21. Re2 Rb7 22. Qa8 Bc6 23. Qc8 {Cleverly avoiding the discovery [...R-N8 ch RxR (or NxR) ...BxQ]} Qc4 24. Rc1 Re7 25. Rcc2 Rd7 {Despite being down a whole Rook, Black fights on gamely.} 26. Ne4 Qd5 27. Red2 Qxe4 28. Qxc6 {With every pair of pieces that vanish, White's Rook advantage gets that much bigger.} d5 29. h3 Qf5 30. Bd4 Ne4 31. Rde2 {White continues to press, also looking for ways to simplify and exchange down.} Re7 32. f3 Re6 33. Qc7+ Re7 34. Qc6 Re6 35. Qb7+ {Pushing for a defensive blunder.} Re7 36. Rc7 {Forcing the exchange of Black's last Rook.} Rxc7 37. Qxc7+ Kg6 38. fxe4 {With the fall of the Knight, Black could easily resign here. However, he plays it out to the end.} dxe4 39. Qg3+ Kh7 40. Qxg7# {Finis.}
