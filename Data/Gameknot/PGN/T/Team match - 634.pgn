1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 {long forgotten variation of the ruy lopez opening. I believe that it gives an advantage to white.} 4. Bxc6+ {I think that 4.d4 is more practical.} bxc6 5. d4 Bg4 6. dxe5 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 dxe5 {black should have seen this position when he played 5... Bg4. his pawn structure is very dificult to defend (three groups and doble pawns on the c file). the only benefit from this variation is the open d file and the semi-open b file.} 8. O-O h6 {why? why not 8...Rb8? after 9. Bg5 there is Be7 and nothing happened...} 9. Rd1 Bd6 {now the bishop is in the role of a pawn. white has to play c4 and after Black's c5 the bishop has no advantages over a pawn. for Black's behalf I can say that there is a plan of f5 somehow and it will give a better resistance.} 10. b3 c5 11. Ba3 Qe7 {free the bishop from the pin.} 12. Nc3 c6 13. Ne2 {interesting idea should be 13. Na4 with the idea of taking on d6 with the rook and c5 with the bishop.} Nf6 14. Rab1 {cant figure that out. why not 14.Rd2? with Rad1 on the next move.} a5 15. Bc1 {white begins to lose his advantages. why to play Rab1 and then Bc1? the bishop was well placed...} Rb8 {black finds the immediate weakness. the rook on b1 is not protected.} 16. Bd2 c4 {black sacrifices two pawns in order to ruin White's pawn structure and to gain more maneuvering space. very interesting.} 17. bxc4 Rxb1 18. Rxb1 O-O 19. Bxa5 Ra8 {taking one pawn back with a better position.} 20. Bc3 Rxa2 21. Qd3 {must protect c2.} g6 {I think that in order to pass f5 that was a good move.} 22. Ra1 {the theory says that one should exchange pieces when he has more material. I think that the position is rather equal or maybe even in Black's favour so the rook exchange is not that great.} Rxa1+ 23. Bxa1 g5 24. g3 {white needs to be more active so he should put his queen on the queen-side (open files a and b). to do that he must play first f3 because of the e4 pawn. you cant defend a pawn with a queen for a long time...} Nd7 {finding the strong spots b6 and c5.} 25. Qe3 Bc5 26. Qf3 Nb6 27. Qb3 Qf6 {black manages to gain lots of space. the white bishop says all about White's position.} 28. Qd3 {there is no defend against Qxf2...} Qxf2+ 29. Kh1 Qf1+ {the end...}
