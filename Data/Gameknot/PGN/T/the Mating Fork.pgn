[Opening "King's pawn opening (B00)"]

1. e4 {As usual, I like to begin with the King's Pawn Opening.} h5 {I am not sure why she played this, but I have seen this a couple of times.  Binblaster and Schakaterzie, like to open with 1.a4, or 1...a4.  Although 1...a5 was not played, this is very similar.} 2. g3 {If she had responded with the King's Pawn Game or Siclian Defense (played 1...c5, or 1...e5), I would have responded with the King's Knight Opening, or Open Siclian.  Therefore, I would have played 2.Nf3, either way.  However, she does something out of the ordinary, but unlike my first game against binblaster, I am not going to get overwhelmed, this time.  As a result, I decide to advance my g pawn so that I will have more options, when developing my LSB.  In reality, I am trying to fianchetto it.} e5 {She responds with this move.  Personally, I do not mind because it is very similar to the King's Pawn Game.} 3. Nf3 {Before, that happens, I decide to develop my King's Knight, as it is very similar to the King's Knight Opening.} f6 {At this point, I do not know what she is thinking because this is not the Sicilian Defense.  Her plans, however, might be very dangerous and lead to a potential threat.  } 4. Nh4 {!! 4.d4 was an option, but 3...d6 was not played.  Otherwise, 3...d6, 4.d4.  Then, if 4...exd4, I sac that pawn, so it becomes a true gambit.  Why?  I give it up to develop my DSB.  This move, however, is best, and a Knight on the rim is dim, in this case.  If, 4...f5, my knight is not in danger, she looses a piece, if 4...f5?, 5.Ng6, forking her rook and DSB.  That would win a free bishop, at least.} Ne7 {!! She sees the threat and responds with this move because it is the only way to prevent a bishop and rook fork.  However, there is a drawback.  In this position, she has blocked three of her important pieces, the DSB, Queen, and King.  } 5. Nc3 {At this point, I decide to develop my other knight because I want to develop all of them, ASAP.  Afterall, that is an important strategy, in chess, and it is where the principle of not touching your same piece comes in handy.  Right now, I am trying to prevent her from stopping my development.} g5 {At this point, she is sick of my knight, so she decides to shoe it away.  I could take advantage with 6.Nf5, Nxf5 7.exf5?, but I am not going to do this.  Why not, and what makes it bad?  One time, I witnessed this, in a similar position, and it weakened his position.  In fact, it eventually led to his loosing blunder.  I would have doubled pawns.  Most importantly, it would lead to a king exposure, and that could become costly. } 6. Nf3 g4 {?! After the retreat, she decides to reattack the knight, but this is a waste of time and development because I can easily defend my piece, in this position.} 7. Nh4 c6 {? In the meantime, she probably wants to bring her Queen out, but it is not a good move.  Why?  In this position, she has blocked her LSB, and she could only defend the b1 knight, by placing it on the rim.} 8. Bg2 {Therefore, I take advantage by developing my LSB.  As I had mentioned earlier, I am trying to develop all of my pieces.} b5 {?! I originally thought that she was trying to develop her LSB, but I learned that she is not, later in the game.  If she was, I would mark with a !.  Instead, she just wants to attack my c3 knight, but this is another, "wasted move" because I will use a special tactic that is very difficult and complicated.  What am I trying to do, in this position?  } 9. h3 {At this point, I decide to play an aggressive move by attacking her g4 pawn.  This position involves cognition.  BTW, cognition=mind behavior, and it usually involves the thought process.  In this case, I am specifically implying and alluding to thought process.  This is a different Scare Tactic that does not involve a check.  Right now, I am attacking her pawn.  Now, if 9...gxh3, 10.Rxh4, and I look for plans to outsmart her.  However, she does not play that.} b4 {Instead, she attacks my knight with another pawn push, but I will defend it.  In my opinion, she is trying to outsmart me, but that attempt will not work, in this game.  Note: as some Class B and Class A players know, I do not get fooled, easily.  I usually know what my opponent is trying to do.  Afterall, there are ways to determine your opponents attempts, plans, and strategies.  } 10. Na4 d5 {In the meantime, she decides to attack my e4 pawn.  As I had alluded to earlier, she is probably did this to scare and intimidate me, in this game.  However, I am not going to allow that.  Therefore, I will not exchange my e4 pawn, with her d5 pawn.  Instead, I exchange my h3 pawn, with her g4 pawn.  In my opinion, that poses a bigger threat, but I could be wrong.  If I am going correct, however, I am going to get rid of the threat, immediately.  Note: I am not obsessed with or think about these types of threat, due to my level of inexperience.  It is because I was taught to analyze the position and look out for the threats and disadvantages of each candidate move.} 11. hxg4 Bxg4 12. f3 {You might think that I placed myself in danger by allowing her to attack my Queen.  However, this was also part of my plan, and it worked, this time.  That is because of this move.  Something similar happened in a different game, where I attacked the Queen.  However, the opponent defended it and attacked my bishop, in the same way and it significantly strengthened his position.  Therefore, I decide to use the same strategy.} Be6 13. Nc5 {If I cannot take her LSB, I have a different tactic.  What is it?  } Bf7 14. f4 {I decide to push another pawn.  Right now, my goal is to force another exchange, but that will not work.} Qb6 {That is because she attacks with her Queen.  However, I will try to retreat it, in the same way.  Now, I have another strategy, but what is it?  I am trying to annoy her by alluring her to keep attacking the knight so that I can defend it, in the same way.  If she gets annoyed enough, it will anger her, and that is what I am trying to do.  I want to make her angry because I know that getting angry is a way to loose a chess game.  If my plan works, I will use it to my advantage.} 15. Na4 {Therefore, I decide to attack her Queen because I know that she can reattack my piece, with her attacked piece.} Qd4 {She sees my plan, and it does not work.  Instead, she retreats it.} 16. d3 {There is something that I had missed here.  I played this move because I thought that it was the only way to protect my hanging e4.  However, I did not realize that my e4 was not hanging, until a day later.  Something similar happened in my game against l-d-j, during the end.  How is my e4 pawn protected?  In this position, 16...Bxe4+?? is not feasible, due to my LSB. } Bh6 {Now, she decides to develop her DSB.  In addition, she is also trying to develop her other pieces and castle, but I have other plans, before she can do that.  What are those plans?  } 17. c3 {I decide to fork her Queen and b4 pawn to win a pawn, but it gets better.  How?} bxc3 18. bxc3 Qxa4 {?? She thinks that she has won a piece for her pawn, but that is what I wanted her to think.  Afterall, that happened in my game against l-d-j, and I had to find another way to correct my mistake.  However, I use this information to my advantage, and it is not a mistake.  This time, it is a deflective sacrifice, instead of an error.  Now, I am going to win her Queen, due to this played move, so this is her loosing blunder.  After I take the Queen, I am going to ascertain, that she is not able to correct her mistakes by winning back the Queen or the game.  For those that are wondering, ascertain=to varify, make certain, or sure.  Afterall, Jack Stockel illustrated and l-d-j has learned that it is not a good idea to underestimate your opponent, even if you are winning.} 19. Qxa4 d4 {Right now, she wants to force a pawn exchange, and I do not mind because I am ahead.  In fact, I would normally exchange, but I have even better plans.  What are they?} 20. Qb4 {At this point, she must advance and sacrifice her knight, or I am going to win her rook.} Na6 21. Qb7 Nc7 22. Qxc7 Rg8 {She sees that my g3 pawn is hanging, so she tries to take advantage by attacking it.  Once again, I am not going to get anxious or be intimidated easily.  Therefore, I am now planning a mating sequence against her, so the game is officially lost for black, at this point.} 23. Ba3 {This is why the game is lost.} Ng6 {She sees that I am trying to mate her with my Q&LSB, so she plays this.  In fact, this is her only choice to avoid, what I had just mentioned.} 24. Qxc6+ {Although her last move delayed me from mating her, mate cannot be prevented any longer.  Having said that, I take advantage by placing her in a very serious check.  First, this check wins a free pawn, in addition to what I have already won.  Second, it takes away her opportunity to castle.  Note: Although she could not castle Kingside, it was feasible to castle Queenside and connect her rooks.  That feasibility, however, is gone.  Most importantly, it forks her King and Rook.  Therefore, I am going to win her rook, after she gets out of check.  This is just the beginning.} Kd8 25. Qxa8+ {If you thought that was bad, it gets much worse.  Now, I am going to take another pawn and place her back in chess.  After that happens, the most dramatic end comes, so stay tuned.} Kd7 26. Qxa7+ Ke6 {This is it.  At this point, her LSB is now protected by the King, so it is no longer feasible to take it.  Therefore, I am trying to come up with other ways to place her in check, and eventually mate.  However, I now have a mate in one, that I almost missed.  How can I mate in one?  By forking her K&N, with my P, and that is why this annotation is called the mating fork.  Afterall, this is the fork that will mate her. } 27. f5# {Before this game, I knew the power of forks.  In other words, I realized that forks could do significant damage, and indirectly win a game.  However, I had no idea that they could directly mate an opponent.  Having said that, I learned the true value of forks, from this game.}
