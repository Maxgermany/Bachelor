1. d4 d5 {Many chess games against stronger player are unpleasant because you are getting tactically outplayed.  Often one gets the sinking sensation that the game is going to be a loss; that he will "take an L".  I have often counted it a principle to be sporting in such games.  Ultimately chess is about a search for perfection.  One values his knowledge of the game more than he clings to the spoils of any single victory.  In this sense, since we stand to learn directly from our superiors in the game, we should be grateful, and even value the difficult positions that attend our encounters with our teachers...} 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bf4 {I don't know if there is a preferable square for the bishop, but I wanted to play e3...} Bg7 4. e3 Nf6 5. h3 {I am not that concerned about Ng4, but I wanted to provide a retreat square for the bishop if necessary.  This move does slow white's development, however...} Nh5 6. Bh2 b6 {I am much more concerned about the threat of c5 than black's fianchettoed bishop... } 7. Bd3 Na6 {A crude an ineffective move...} 8. Nbd2 Nb4 {The point of Na6 is revealed.  In my opinion, this knight maneuver is premature...} 9. Be2 Bf5 {With threats of Nxc2+, winning the exchange.  I am forced to consider my Be2 a blunder, and I should have prevented the knight from coming to b4.} 10. Rc1 Nxa2 11. Ne5 {I wanted to introduce some tactics into the position...} Nxc1 12. Bb5+ Kf8 13. Qxc1 Bxe5 14. dxe5 {Perhaps bxe5 was better.  This was a blitz game, and my play could have been a lot better...} d4 15. g4 Qd5 16. Rg1 {My position is falling apart, but I want to open the g-file, if possible.  I am not yet resigned to defeat...} Ng7 17. Bc4 {An intermediate move that accomplished little beside the removal of a d4 defender...} Qc6 18. gxf5 dxe3 {Here I assessed my position as totally critical.  I am now almost certain that the game will be a loss.  I have not recovered from black's Nb4, and my own attacking prospects appear to be too little, too late...} 19. fxe3 Nxf5 20. Bxf7 {A desperate move to stave off Nxe3...} Kxf7 21. Rf1 {My queen is my worst piece, having to recapture the knight on c1.  It is totally out of the game.  If possible, I want to arrange the rousing Ne4 or Nf3...} Qg2 22. e4 {The bishop could have been defended with Bf4, but then g5.  I am desperate to get the queen out...} Qxh2 23. exf5 gxf5 {Here black could've played more sharply with Qxe5...} 24. Nf3 {I had seen that h3 was immune, but black blunders massively, in a won position, and up 4 units of material.  If nothing else, this game illustrates how in blitz, it can be good to stick with a lost position.  I think that after Nb4, black relaxed a bit and didn't play accurately enough to keep me out of the game...} Qxh3 25. Ng5+ {}
