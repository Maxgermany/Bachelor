1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {I feel like Nc3 or d4 would have a been more effective move here. } Nf6 4. Qe2 {Too early to be moving the Q, especially with all the minor pieces still awaiting development. This move will likely cause some pain for white later on as it will require moving the Q again before the light square bishop can get going. The castle is going to require giving up tempo to black. } Bc5 {Black has already opened for castling, developed three minor pieces, and working on controlling the center.} 5. Qc4 {Moved the Q again when d4 would have been the better move. It also would have allowed bringing out Nd2 and getting all the minors involved, which is still a concern.} d6 6. Ng5 {Good thought, but I think most opponents will see this coming and the fix is too simple. Development would have been the better option since black achieves two goals with one move now.} O-O {Threat neutralized.} 7. b4 {Not terrible, but still... three minor pieces on the first rank.} Bxf2+ {This move... I feel like Bb6 was the better move. I know some people feel the uneven trade is worth breaking the castle, but I don't.} 8. Kxf2 Ng4+ {Check... and black begins making up the material and encroaching on white's territory with little to no counter attack possible.} 9. Ke1 Qxg5 10. h3 {h4 would have been the better threat. Or Be2?} Qh4+ 11. Kd1 {White's stuck moving the K around, paying now for shoddy development earlier. Nasty fork coming right up.} Nf2+ 12. Kc2 {At this point, it's all black's game. } Nxh1 13. d4 {Giving up a pawn here.} Qxe4+ 14. Kb2 Nf2 15. Nd2 Qf5 16. d5 Ne7 17. Bd3 {No teeth left in anything for white. Any trade in material is only in black's favor, but he's just handing over the B here. Black has two threats on d3 before this move.} Nxd3+ 18. Ka3 Bd7 19. Nf3 a5 {Coordinating the forces. White is in complete disarray and can only prolong, not prevent.} 20. Kb3 b5 21. Qxc7 Nxd5 22. Qxd6 a4+ 23. Ka3 Rac8 24. Nd2 {Qxd5 would have been a slightly better move.} Rxc3+ 25. Nb3 Nd5xb4 26. Qxb4 {Maybe just distracted by something else? Anything would have been better, but especially g4. } Nxb4 27. Kxb4 Rfc8 28. Nd2 Qf4+ 29. Ka5 e4 {Black should have Ra8+ here and shaved two moves off the end.} 30. Ba3 {Giving up the N here, but not much difference is made here. } Qxd2 31. Bb4 Ra8+ 32. Kb6 Qh6+ {Adding another move to a game that should have been over.} 33. Kb7 Qc6# {And now it is.}
