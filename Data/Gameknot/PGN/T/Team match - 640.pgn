[Opening "Old Benoni defence (A43)"]

1. d4 {Here is a team game which I lost just now. A very accurate kingside attack by Black, coupled with some less-than-perfect manoeuvring by White (me!) creates its own conclusion.} c5 {Black replies to my Queen Pawn with the Old Benoni; this is in contrast to the more usually played Benoni, which goes 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5. Naturally the two may well transpose.} 2. d5 {I play the main line of all Benonis (Benonae?) : to advance the d-pawn and claim some of Black's space.} Nf6 3. c4 {And already we have transposed back into a Benoni, although the GameKnot database, which does not really understand transpositions, still calls this position an Old Benoni. Although, having said that, it may well be the Benoni transposing back into the Old Benoni!} g6 {!? An interesting move, clearly aimed at fianchettoing the kingside bishop to prevent it from being blocked in by pawns on d6 and c5. The theory behind this move seems natural; nonetheless, it is less popular on the GK database than 3...b5, the Benko Gambit, and the natural Benoni moves 3...e6 and 3...d6, in that order.} 4. Nc3 {This seems natural and is typical to White's side of the Benoni: naturally, to shore up the d5-pawn and prepare for the central thrust 5.e4.} Bg7 {Black continues with his house-building on the kingside. Soon, I assume, he will castle and only then turn his attentions to the centre.} 5. e4 {The central push, solidifying White's advantage in central space.} O-O 6. Nf3 d6 7. h3 {The database suggested this move. I can see its logic, preventing Black from exchanging with ...Bg4. 5.h3 is the main line of the Czech Benoni; I hadn't thought to see it here. I suppose this is a good time, on a different note, to mention one of my main long-term errors in this game: my attitude to the position. I still saw it as a blocked and slow Benoni position: I had failed to change my style of play to correspond with the transposition into the much sharper King's Indian Defence.} a6 {Preparing for queenside expansion with 8...b5.} 8. a4 {Naturally I wish to prevent this; 8.a4 seems most effective. The database agrees.} Nbd7 {Since the knight's best c6-square is under attack, this knight is clearly aiming for the relatively strong position b6. This puts my pawns under pressure, but has the drawback of preventing ...b6 or ...b5.} 9. Bf4 {This bishop is misplaced. It can soon be chased away with 9...e5...as I soon see...} e5 10. Be3 {Again, misplaced. I realised about 5 seconds after this move that 10.Bg5 would have been much better, flowing towards an Averbakh Variation of the KID.} Nb6 11. b3 {Shoring up my queenside. For now, All Quiet on the Queenside Front.} Nbd7 12. Bg5 {This bishop has been getting a lot of exercise recently. But I reasoned that the loss of tempi isn't so bad, as Black has lost 2 with his knight.} Qa5 13. Bd2 {OK, now the loss of tempi really is getting annoying.} Qc7 14. Bd3 Nh5 {I realised that, soon, a kingside attack would start. I though I would be able to weather it. I probably was right, but I didn't manage to anyway.} 15. O-O {Was I insane? I know. I castle right into where I think there's going to be an attack. Castling was never (or, not very often) so risky. I should definitely have castled queenside, where, despite the advanced pawns, all is quiet.} Nf4 16. Bxf4 {How do you neutralise an attack? Exchange pieces. That sounded good to me. True, it does give the opponent an aggressively-placed pawn...} exf4 17. Rc1 {Defending the knight.} Ne5 18. Nxe5 Bxe5 {Another exchange. I suppose I was hoping for 18...dxe5 when I have a passed d-pawn and can stir up some distracting trouble in the centre. Naturally, 18...Bxe5 is much better, as it avoids that complication, and brings another unit into an attacking position.} 19. Qf3 {I though a mobile queen in front of the kingside would help defend. First big short-term error.} Qe7 {Moving into a more easily attacking position.} 20. Kh2 {2nd big short-term error. I was thinking of moving the f-rook further into the kingside to defend, and then fleeing with my king to the, I now realised, safer queenside. In effect, I was trying to "uncastle" by hand. The problems? a) This wastes a lot of moves. b) You're about to see.} h5 {PAWN STORM. Trying to shatter my king's protective armour. (In my opinion, what little there was wasn't worth the effort :-))} 21. Rfh1 {Step 2 of "uncastling by hand".} Qh4 {I should have seen it coming...} 22. Ne2 {Why hadn't I thought of that move before!!?!?!? It makes the defensive thrust g3, which I was planning, so much easier, frees up my queenside rook to defend, and the knight itself can defend. I will leave it to the viewers of this annotation to decide whether this move, played a little earlier, would have saved me - would it????? But, at this moment in time, it was not a good idea,} Bg4 {My queen is stylishly and brilliantly trapped. Time to resign. Jury...how could I have saved myself after the kingside attack started?? Well played, Black.}
