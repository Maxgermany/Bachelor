[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), Chigorin variation"]

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 {Queen's pawn, Chigorin Variation.} e6 {Black usually plays Nf6 here for good effect, though this is the second most popular response.} 3. Bf4 g5 4. Be5 f6 5. Bg3 Bb4 6. Qd2 Bxc3 7. Qxc3 h5 {Wait, white can take Pc7 essentially for free here.  Bxc7.} 8. Bxc7 Qe7 9. h3 Nc6 10. Bh2 e5 11. O-O-O g4 12. hxg4 f5 {I think Pxg4 would have been better.  This would pin white's black bishop against the rook.} 13. gxf5 Bxf5 14. e3 Nb4 {Clever threat.  If white moves Pa2, Na2+ gives black the white queen.} 15. Qb3 {White counters.  Black's pawn @ e5 is at risk.} Rc8 16. Bxe5 {Ooh, BxPc2 forks white's rook and queen.  On the other hand, black now faces the prospect of BxRh8, a free rook, while black's fork involves an exchange.} Rh6 17. Bf4 Rxc2+ {A move fraught with potential.  White could trade queen and bishop for both black's rooks and a knight or bishop.  But Kb1 is answered by Rc3+, and black trades rook for queen.} 18. Kb1 Rxf2+ {I still like Rc3+.  Yes, white gets a rook, but a rook for a queen!  Here black just picks up one pawn.} 19. Kc1 {To save Rh6, Rc6+ would work.  Oh, how pretty.  White is stuck interposing pieces black can pick off.  Looks like Qc3 is white's best bet.  Very painful.  Because Bc4 would be followed by RxBc4+, and then Qc3, and black trades rook for queen.  So Rc6+, Qc3.  Black makes out like a bandit!} Nd3+ {Nope.  Here white responds with BxNd3.  BxBd3, QxBd3...  Actually BxRh6 and white comes out ahead.} 20. Bxd3 Be6 {Instead of Be6, Rf6 would protect that bishop.  Now white is bound to trade bishop for rook.} 21. Bxh6 Nxh6 22. Nh3 Bxh3 {I kind of like RxPg2 better.  After white takes the bishop Pd5 is undefended.} 23. gxh3 {White would have been better off playing RxPh3, to protect Pe3--specifically QxPe3+.} Qxe3+ 24. Kb1 Qxd4 25. Rhe1+ Kd7 {Oh, no!  Disaster!  Black should have played Kd8 or perhaps Kf8 (which would let white force a rook trade).  Kd7 gives white the black queen free and easy with Bb5+.  :(} 26. Bb5+ Kd6 {}
