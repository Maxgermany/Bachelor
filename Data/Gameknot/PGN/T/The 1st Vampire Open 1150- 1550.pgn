1. d4 {d4,probably the 2nd most common opening in chess} d5 {d5, my typical response} 2. Bf4 {bishop opening of an interesting and dangerous kind} Bd7 {that was a little stupid and odd on my part i tihnk i'm too paranoid that the knight is going come hop on over to b5} 3. Nc3 {well he's hopping alright , to the now unprotected pawn} e6 {supporting it} 4. e4 {challenging for the center of wihch I have next to no control} Nf6 {not wise i totally space advance to e5} 5. e5 {yep, that's what i would have done too} Ng8 {retreat, better probably is Ne4  because it at least allows development and potential castling} 6. Bb5 {interesting} c6 {????Why didn't i take. Bxb5, Nxb5, Qd7, now i bet i know why i lost} 7. Bd3 {retreat} Qh4 {???????????Pointless Bg3} 8. g3 {or better yet that} Qd8 {wasted move} 9. Nf3 {developing to castle, i'm not even close yet} c5 {let's force the center open where my king is sitting stupdily, ok} 10. Nb5 {well but of course} c4 {brilliance, finally something i did right} 11. Bg5 {oh if it wasn't for that} f6 {NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What on earth was I thinking, that totally exposes me, i should of just blocked with the bishop or knight} 12. exf6 { yep} gxf6 {yeah} 13. Be3 {retreat} Bxb5 {i get his knight at the cost of exposure} 14. Be2 {retreat,} Nc6 {developing finally, but into what castle?} 15. c3 {here comes the jugganout queen} Qe7 {logical} 16. O-O {castling} O-O-O {still a sitting duck} 17. b3 {here comes the tornado of pawns} a5 {trouble looking probable for the future} 18. bxc4 {taking} dxc4 {taking back} 19. Rb1 {and my problems begin even though i'm up in material, i'm a dead man} Ba6 {retreat} 20. Nd2 {reangling for the attack} Qa3 {and i'm worried about material?WHY!!!!} 21. Nxc4 {LOL,I bet i missed THAT!} Bxc4 {recapturing} 22. Bxc4 {and i get more problems} Re8 {protecting} 23. Rb3 {chasing me back into the foxhole} Qd6 {yep} 24. Qh5 {and the full on attack begins} Qe7 {protect} 25. Rfb1 {more problems i wonder if i saw Rxb7, Qxb7, Rxb7, Kxb7,Qxe8} Rd8 {ok first thing i did right, although there is probably better, at least i saw the basic level blunder} 26. Rb3xb7 {yep} Qe8 {depserately trying to exchange the queens} 27. Qg4 {ew....} f5 {best i got not that it's going to be good enough, LOL, I have 6 pieces on the back rank, undeveloped and he's got 2 , one of which is assisting in the battery up my back side} 28. Qg5 {reangling} Bh6 {let's develop starting humm.....at move 28!} 29. Qh4 {pretty much} Bxe3 {take} 30. fxe3 {recapture} Nge7 {i develop } 31. Bxe6+ {NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I missed that twice now, once annotating and once playing, i resign here, the follow up is of course... Rd7, Bxd7+,Kd8 and then Rb8 checkmate, or Qxd7, followed by Rxd7, and then eventually defeat. Good game Moru, I'll have to play a better one next time, because that was lousy on my part.I was Going Nowhere Fast there, LOL. Until we meet again, muhhahhhhhh!!!!!!!! This is Count Gator flying off to the castle, good day }
