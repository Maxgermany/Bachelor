1. e4 d5 2. e5 Bf5 3. d4 e6 4. Nf3 a6 5. c3 c5 6. Qa4+ {Everything normal till here. Now white goes for the check adventure. } b5 7. Qd1 {It wasn't so great, isn't it?} Nc6 8. Be2 Qb6 9. Be3 cxd4 {Black can manage the exchange. } 10. cxd4 {This is the worst way for white to retake. Now both sides are almost cramped. The obvious Bb4+ is ok, but I wanted to try another idea. } Bxb1 11. Rxb1 {This allows Qa4+ and then Qxa2, but I felt a lot of danger in it. } Bb4+ {The "surprise" move would have been Nb4. This knight is powerful once Rc8 has been played. I often prefer it in such a situation.} 12. Bd2 Nge7 {I didn't see any clear attack in Qa5 now. Maybe it was whorth a second look. } 13. a3 {If 13... Nxd4, 14. BxB, NxNf3+, 14. BxN, with good game. But I wasn't sure about it. } Bxd2+ 14. Qxd2 {Well, my strategy is not great. I couldn't create the unbalance. White stands still on defence of d4. } Nf5 15. Rd1 {Ok. White defends. But it is almost completely cramped!} O-O {I thought about Ke7, but I didn't want to fear some white queen incursion in the future. In doing so, I loosen the pressure and allow him to castle, too. } 16. O-O Rfc8 {My plan was to press on the queenside, but it was a bad plan. } 17. g4 {I didn't see this. } Nfe7 18. Qg5 {Now is white who attacks. } Ng6 19. Rd2 {White had to go h4, but then h6, and if Qh5, Nf4 forks Q and B...} b4 {Pushing before white can organize.} 20. axb4 {Thank you, white. } Nxb4 {The white queen is almost out of squares. I want to prepare the assault at her square before I push h6. } 21. Qe3 {White "smells the danger". But...} Nc2 {...he must lose the exchange. The queen has no squares! (Qg5, h6). And it has a lot of squares to go, but... none can save it!} 22. Qd3 Nf4 {Can you believe it? Not even now, changing the diag color!} 23. Rxc2 Nxd3 24. Rxc8+ Rxc8 25. Bxd3 {The best option for white, I think!} Qxb2 26. Bxa6 Rc3 {No danger of a back rank mate! It feels so strange!...} 27. Kg2 {Now, the obvious Qb3 is met by Be2, so...} Qa2 {And, be aware... THE BISHOP IS OUT OF SQUARES TOO! That's most incredible. If Bb7, Qb3 wins the knight... If Ra1 to threat mate, h6 and it's ok. If Ng5, so that if Qb3, Ra1, QxB defends a8. White is lost. } 28. Rb1 {:-) One never knows...} Qxb1 {}
