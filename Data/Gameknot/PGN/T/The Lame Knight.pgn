[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03)"]

1. e4 {White starts out with the very solid 1. e4.} Nf6 {Black responds by preemptively taking out his knight with 1...Nf6? This blunder allows White to attack the Knight and take more central territory.} 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 {Taking even more central territory. White's advantage right now is decisive.} c6 4. c4 {Taking even more territory. Black's knight is feeling heavy pressure, and is nothing but a liability for Black at this point.} Nb4 5. a3 g6 {Realizing his knight was a major liability, Black smartly decides to sacrifice it.} 6. axb4 Qb6 7. Qd2 h5 {Black initiates a kingside attack. Majorly behind in development and pieces, will it be successful?} 8. c5 Qc7 9. Bc4 Bh6 10. Qc2 {A high-level move, allowing White's queen to supervise both bishops at once.} Bg7 {Instead of taking White's unblocked dark-square bishop, Black wisely blocks his own bishop.} 11. Nf3 {Continuing development. Transition to a normal mainline is still possible.} e6 12. Bg5 Rf8 {Black moves his rook for no discernible reason.} 13. Nc3 f6 {Major blunder.} 14. Qxg6+ Rf7 15. exf6 Bh8 {Another major blunder, allowing White to force checkmate.} 16. Qg8+ Rf8 17. f7# {After a series of conditional moves, White wins the game.}
