1. d4 {Mon Capitan asked me to annotate a few games.  I have chosen this one because I'm expecting to lose it.( His ranking has been as high as 2089)} d5 {Queen's gambit coming up.  (is he going to copy the reverse game?)  Develop knights, h6(preparation for the huge amount of white material that goes kingside)} 2. c4 dxc4 {It is a material advantage.  White can get it back after e3 or e4 if they choose.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Nc6 5. Bxc4 h6 6. Nc3 e6 {I normally don't block my bishop diagonals, but becuase of the ranking difference( he is on the rise again), I am going defensive.  I am likely to go Bd7 as result anyway.  Long term plan is to lay in for a siege from white on the kingside, with perhaps some forays from me down the queenside with a knight especially if he doesn't play a3.} 7. O-O a6 8. e4 Be7 9. Be3 O-O 10. Ne5 Bd7 11. f4 Na5 12. Be2 b5 {The defence is in place.  This move is likely to provoke the a3, but it will keep the bishop back from the centre, so the castle attack that is coming from white will hopefully be focused along h, g, f, without the backup support through the centre.  This might sound odd, but I might start my queenside foray with a focus on e4} 13. a3 Nb7 14. Bf3 Nd6 15. Qe1 Rb8 {Looks like he has seen the queenside foray and negated it.  This is to get the rook out and working after the exchange of pieces in the centre OR the king side attack from white.  I may try to speed it up with b4, leading to a pawn exchange that opens a and b} 16. Nxd7 Nxd7 17. b3 b4 18. Qd1 {I think I just got very lucky.} bxc3 19. Qc2 Nf6 20. a4 Nfxe4 {the pawn on c3 can't be protected easily atm, so I am really up  2 on material.  The exchange will make it  2, but improve my position because I should then be able to control and use most of the queenside of the board.  I should also be able to keep the pawn(nicely advanced aint it) and protect it.} 21. Bxe4 Nxe4 22. Qxe4 Rxb3 23. Rfb1 Rb2 {See if we can shift the exchange to b2 - only 1 unsafe square in front of pawn rather than two.  Or he may pull bishop from the centre to keep the exchange on b1, which may give oppurtunities to pick up pawns as two are isolated.} 24. Rxb2 cxb2 25. Rb1 Ba3 26. Qd3 Qd6 27. Qb3 Rd8 {The next few moves are for position.  While d is good, b is better to control with the Q and/or R.  Also getting my Q down on b3  or c1 could be useful.  If the pawns on a6 and a4 are cleared, moving the rook across to a with the Q on b3, c1, or b4 could also be useful.} 28. h3 c6 29. Bf2 Rb8 30. Qd3 Qb4 31. Qxa6 Qd2 32. Qf1 Ra8 33. Qe1 Qc2 34. Qd1 Qxd1+ {Got most of the positions I wanted.  I should be a able to use the pawn promotion to come out ahead in forthcoming exchanges.  Queen for a queen, rook for a bishop, pawn(promoted) for a rook.} 35. Rxd1 Rxa4 36. Rb1 Rc4 37. Be3 Rc1+ 38. Bxc1 bxc1=Q+ 39. Rxc1 Bxc1 40. g3 Be3+ {Free pawn.  Gives me a passed pawn.} 41. Kf1 Bxd4 42. Ke2 f5 {Use pawn on e to remove pawn on f.  Use passed pawn on c to tie the king up.  Bring my king up behind the 3 vs 2 pawns battle on f,g and h.  From that, I should end up with a promoted pawn.} 43. Kd2 h5 44. Ke2 c5 45. Kd3 Kf7 46. Ke2 e5 47. Kd3 exf4 48. gxf4 Kf6 49. Kc4 g5 50. fxg5+ Kxg5 51. Kd3 Kf4 52. h4 Kf3 53. Kc2 Ke2 54. Kb3 f4 55. Kc2 f3 {}
