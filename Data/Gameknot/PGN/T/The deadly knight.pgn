1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Nh5 5. Bg3 Nxg3 6. hxg3 a6 {Here, after this weak black move, the firework start. } 7. Bd3 h6 {Now, watch: } 8. Ng5 {Not only the knight is untakable, but it frees the way to the queen. } Nb4 {Black chooses to remove the bishop, but it is very slow. } 9. Qf3 {The only alternate move for black is Be6, accepting the consecuences. Black choosed...} Nxd3+ 10. cxd3 {Black has the same problem right now. } f6 {No way.} 11. Qh5+ Kd7 {Now, I looked and looked and I didn't see anything better than to win a rook. I feared I could have thrown it away and lose the knight. } 12. Nf7 Qe8 13. Nxh8 Qxh5 14. Rxh5 {I won a rook, and black's is very, very cramped. Still, I have to fight. } e6 15. Nc3 c5 {16 pawns on the board...} 16. Ng6 Bd6 {Here, I sensed that probably it was possible to get more from the position that a choking endgame. } 17. dxc5 Bxc5 18. Nxd5 {With a bishop pair against a knight's one, when the pawns become to be exchanged, my opponent would improve his position. I have a rook, true, so why don't get some emotion in it?} exd5 19. Rxd5+ {This leaves the king a single square. } Kc6 20. Rd8 {e4 was the alternate move. Not Nf4, g5. } Kc7 21. Rg8 {Black can't defend the pawn. But he had a good idea...} Bb4+ 22. Ke2 {?? Kf1 was the simple move to victory. I simply overlooked the following, natural...} Bg4+ 23. f3 Bxf3+ 24. gxf3 Rxg8 {Incredibly, I am still +1!} 25. Rc1+ Kd6 26. a3 Ba5 27. d4 {It is not necessary to help my opponent to have the pieces in its natural square (b6).} Re8 28. Kd3 b5 {This actually half-helps me opening squares on the c column. } 29. Nh4 {threatening a fork check. } g5 30. Nf5+ {My plan was not to take the h pawn, since it actually helps my opponent (not inmediately, but later). } Kd5 {Now I can't take h6 or I will suffer from Rh2, but...} 31. Rc5+ {This makes black lose another time the exchange...} Ke6 32. Ng7+ {Black resigned. Would I have sac the rook for the bishop? :-). Anyway: overall, a wonderful demostration of the knight's power. Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed the game. }
