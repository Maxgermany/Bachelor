1. d4 {Queen's pawn opening.I play because it suits my style.} d5 {More popular is 1...Nf6,but this move is also good and I play this myself as Black.} 2. c4 {Queen's gambit.} dxc4 {Queen's gambit accepted.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 {I prefer to handle the QGA this way as White} b5 {?!Black holds on to the pawn,but this gives white a lead in development.} 5. a4 c6 {better than 5...a6? 6.axb5 and 6...axb5?? hangs the rook after 7.Rxa8} 6. axb5 cxb5 7. b3 {The logical follow-up to 6.axb5.White wins the pawn back.} cxb3 8. Bxb5+ Bd7 9. Qxb3 {I was thinking of 9.Bxd7+ but this helps Black in development.} Bxb5 10. Qxb5+ Nbd7 11. Ne5 {I play a line that my friend and teammate suenteuspo147 played on here a while ago.I think this might be best.} e6 12. Ba3 {Quickly contesting the diagonal.} Bxa3 13. Nxa3 {The knight makes it way to help his comrade on e5 via c4.} O-O 14. Nac4 {White has a small,but enduring advantage.} Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Nd5 {Black establishes and outpost on d5 to counter the knight on e5,but it doesn't do as much as the opposing knight on e5.} 16. O-O f6 17. Nd7 {The knight now takes a journey to the outpost on c5.} Rf7 18. Nc5 {Now,from c5 the knight aims at the weak pawn on e6.It becomes even weaker if it moves forward.} Re7 19. Rfc1 Rb8 20. Qa5 Qxa5 21. Rxa5 Nc3 {?!A sly trap.22.Rxc3?? Rb1+ leads to mate.Luckily I anticipated this ahead of time and realized Black would lose a pawn.} 22. Kf1 {Now White's king has an escape route via e2.Now it can head toward the center } Nd5 {This forced.} 23. Nxe6 {!Removing the defender of the knight on e6.} Rxe6 24. Rxd5 Re7 25. Rdc5 {White doubles rooks on the c-file.It takes technique to win the endgame.} Kf7 26. Rc5c7 {Looking for 26...Rxc7 27.Rxc7+ winning another pawn.} Rb7 27. Rxe7+ Rxe7 28. Ra1 {White paraylzes the passed pawn.} Ke6 29. Ke2 Kd5 30. Kd3 {White has a more favorable endgame a pawn up then some other endgames.Black's passed pawn is doing nothing and the Black rook is stuck along the 7th rank.} Kc6 31. e4 {supporting the d-pawn's advance.} Kb5 32. Rb1+ Kc6 33. d5+ Kc5 34. Rc1+ Kd6 35. Rc6+ {White's position has improved even more!} Ke5 {I think 35...Kd7 is a better try.} 36. Ke3 {threatening 37.f4#} g5 {only defense} 37. g3 g4 {only defense if 38.f4+ gxf3 en passant } 38. h3 {hoping to lure the pawn away.} h5 {38...gxh3?? 39.f4#} 39. hxg4 hxg4 40. Rc1 {!? a odd move.I hope to keep my position more flexible} f5 {hoping to win the e4 pawn.} 41. Rc4 {41.exf5?! 41...Kxf5+or 41...Kxd5+ and White may not win the endgame.} Rd7 42. exf5 {! this move clinches the game.} Kxf5 43. Rf4+ {A good followup.White cuts off Black's king.} Kg5 {43...Ke5 44.Rxg4.44...Kxd5 45.Rd4+ wins.44...Rxd5 45.Rg5+ wins.} 44. Kd4 {The white king has way better king position than his counterpart on g5.} a5 45. Kc5 {ready to push the d-pawn and defending against 45...a4.} a4 {? Black does it anyway.Although he is already lost.} 46. Rxa4 {The rest doesn't need explanation.} Kf5 47. Kc6 Rd8 48. d6 Ke6 49. Re4+ Kf5 50. Re1 Kg5 51. Kc7 Rf8 52. d7 Rxf2 53. d8=Q+ Rf6 54.
