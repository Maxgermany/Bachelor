1. e4 {Hi Team I thought this was an interesting game as I seem to make mistakes and offer pieces for little gain but as you will see works in my favour. Also it makes it better as it's one of my first team games. Feel free to offer your advice on where I did well or made mistakes. I would like to see where I could improve or how he could of stopped me. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 {As you can see I open with the Two knights defence, Modern bishop's opening (that's right I'm learning the openings, thanks game database).} h6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 b5 {So here we have moved on a few moves and the board has developed quite nicely.  My initial plan was to build a solid defence, them draw him out and then try to work an advantage.} 7. Bb3 Bb4 8. a4 Nd4 {Well here he has come out to mount an attack but this is where I see my chance to counter attach.} 9. Bxf7+ {Here is my first attack and what might seem a mistake as I have no cover for my Bishop but by moving his knight to d4 it left my next move wide open.} Kxf7 10. Nxe5+ {Because he moved his knight it left this Pawn on e5 unprotected and allowed me to put him in CHECK and from here on, although he has a points advantage, I have the positional advantage for now at least. This also means that his knight on d4 is now unprotected for me to regain my lost Bishop soon.} Ke6 11. Ng6 {He didn't fall into the obvious trap of moving his king to f8 but I still needed to move my knight and this is the best move I could think of as it still puts him on the defensive.} Re8 12. Bxd4 {His last move also freed me to take his knight with no lose and all he can think to do next is attack my knight.} Kf7 13. Ne5+ {So I move my knight back so he either has to take my knight and I gain a material points advantage or a moving his king back which will effectively give me a free move.} Kg8 14. axb5 a5 15. O-O d6 {Here we have moved on a few moves and I felt my king was a little exposed so I castled. This also freed my Rook in case I needed it. His move here appears sound and I nearly played Nf3 but I noticed an aggressive attack over the next few moves.} 16. Nc6 Qd7 17. Bxf6 {By taking his knight it looks like I am just trying to just reduce his numbers but I really needed his Pawn on g7 to move and I sacrifice my Bishop to do this.} gxf6 18. Nd5 {This is why I needed his Pawn to move to try and take my next move and even if he sees what I am doing I haven't lost any ground to him.} Bb7 19. Nxf6+ {Thankfully he didn't see the three way fork I was creating on his King, Rook and Queen and given that he is already 4 points down and about to lose his Queen he resigns.  I hope you enjoyed the game and thought it was worth a look.}
