1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. Nf3 e4 {This variation always leaves Black with a thorn on e4.} 4. Nd4 Nf6 5. e3 Nxd4 6. Bxd4 Be7 7. c4 O-O 8. Nc3 c5 {No place to retreat the bishop, so I'll have to trade it off. Hate to do that.} 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Qc2 d5 11. cxd5 Bxc3 12. dxc3 Qxd5 13. Bc4 Qc6 14. O-O-O {Not sure if castling queenside will be a good idea, but I'd already been thinking of it, and I kind of made the move automatically. I wanted the rook on that open file.} Be6 15. Bxe6 Qxe6 16. Qe2 a5 {I like that move for him. He threatens a4 and opening the a-file up to get to my king. Now I'm thinking that kingside castling would've been better off for me.} 17. Qb5 {This doesn't stop a4, but it at least makes it a bit more complicated, and I need more complications to make up for my weaker position.} a4 18. Kb2 axb3 19. axb3 {I think I've got to take with the pawn; otherwise, Qg4 causes me too much trouble.} b6 20. Qc4 {I know, it doesn't look like a good move.  My other choice to protect my kingside is Qe2, and I'm bottled in and really don't protect the kingside all that well. So I'll let him double my pawns. He can't immediately take advantage of them, and he may run into trouble if he chooses the wrong way to get them. Probably his best choice, after trading the queens is to put his rooks on a5 and a8 while I put mine on d6 and d1.  } Qg4 21. Rhg1 Ra7 22. h3 Qg6 23. Qd5 h6 {Everything I can do loses a pawn, or more. Qd6 loses to Rfa8.  g4 loses to Qf6. Ra1 loses to Qf6. But that may be where I need to go. Not good, because when you're losing in an endgame, you want to trade pawns, not pieces.} 24. Rda1 Rxa1 25. Kxa1 Qf6 26. Rc1 {I found a way to stay even materially -- though my isolated e-pawn will mean my pawns are weaker than his.} Qxf2 27. Qxe4 Rd8 28. Rc2 Rd1+ {hmm, is there any advantage at all for going to a2 instead of b2? Only thing I could see is that he's going to go play Qf6 and my pawn on c3 will be pinned. Maybe I should ask it the other way around: is there any advantage to going to b2 over a2? The king guards the rook from b2, but that queen's not going to be attacking it after this move. The king guards c1 after I move the rook, but I imagine he's going to try to keep his rook on that open e-file.} 29. Kb2 Qf1 {}
