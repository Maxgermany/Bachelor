1. d4 {1.d4 This is my favourite first move 'till now.} d5 2. c4 {Queen's gambit.} c6 {Slav defence...I would preferred 2...e6.} 3. Nc3 f5 {Alekhine variation here.} 4. Qb3 {And now I go off Gameknot database with 4.Qb3.} e6 {4...e6. I don't understand this move...Wasn't Nf6 better?} 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. g3 Bd6 7. Bh3 {7.Bh3 I chose to not do the normal fianchetto....Maybe we'll understand if this is been a good move later.} O-O 8. O-O {Castles...} Kh8 {8...Kh8 Black's first move after castle is in order to protect the king a bit more.} 9. c5 Bc7 10. Bg5 h6 11. Bd2 g5 {.....Black wanted to protect his king more with 8...Kh8....and then he moves two moves like h6 and g5....Debetable decisions.} 12. Ne5 {I take the initiative. } Bxe5 13. dxe5 Nfd7 14. f4 {To break this close position.} g4 15. Bg2 {Well.....It wasn't a good choise before...} h5 16. Na4 {King side is defended solidly, so I decide to attack his Queenside.} b5 17. cxb6 e.p. Nxb6 18. Rfc1 Nxa4 19. Qxa4 {Trading knights.} Bd7 20. Qa3 Kg7 21. Ba5 Qe8 22. Bc7 {Bishop raid, part one!} a5 23. Bd6 {Bishop raid, part two;} Rh8 24. Be7 {Bishop raid part three;} Kf7 25. Bf6 {Bishop raid, final part!} Rh7 26. Rc5 Qf8 27. Rac1 Kg6 28. b4 Be8 29. Rxa5 Rxa5 30. Qxa5 {This trade is been great for me!} Rb7 31. a3 Rb5 32. Qd8 Nd7 33. Rxc6 Rb8 34. Qa5 Qf7 35. Rc7 Qf8 {White tries to finish what his bishop had started.} 36. Qa7 Nxf6 37. exf6 Bb5 38. Rg7+ Kh6 39. Bxd5 {Theorically, a bishop has a 3-points value and a pawn has only 1 point....Well in this case, that pawn has a higher value than my bishop.} exd5 40. Rg5 {To free the Queen to attack the king.} Bxe2 {Worthless move!!} 41. Rxh5+ {Rxh5 !! Maybe the only move to get a final attack!} Kg6 {Black doesn't want my rook of course cause if 41...Kxh5 42.Qh7  Qh6 43. Qxf5  Qg5 Qxg5# completely forced! And maybe with Kg6 only an excellent player could escape from a checkmate combo.} 42. Qh7+ Kxf6 43. Qxf5+ Ke7 44. Rh7+ {And here black resigns. His decision of push g and h pawns was bad. Maybe, White's only possibility to win was attacking the king by the queenside. What do you think about it?}
