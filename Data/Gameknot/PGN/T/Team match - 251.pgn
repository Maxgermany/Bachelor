1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Bc5 {Not a common move. } 5. c3 b5 6. Bc2 {considered Bb3 but the text move secures the e4 pawn} Nf6 7. d4 Bd6 {This seems to be a very unnatural position for the black bishop. It's blockading the d pawn, and interferes with the development of the white squared bishop. It seems to have no future on this square and will likely have to move again.} 8. O-O O-O 9. Re1 {Just trying to continue to develop normally and wait for black to move his bishop from d6.} Bb7 10. Bg5 h6 11. Bh4 Qe7 12. Nbd2 Kh7 {Walking into the bishop's path. Not sure this is the best plan for black.} 13. Nf1 {If 13.dxe5 Bxe5 14.Nxe5 Nxe5 15. f4 Qc5 16. Bf2 Ng6 } Rfh8 14. Ne3 Rag8 {Still seems to be the wrong plan for black. Perhaps better is moving the h rook out to the e file or something. The king is very awkwardly placed here.} 15. dxe5 Nxe5 16. Nxe5 Bxe5 17. f4 Bxf4 18. e5+ g6 19. Bxf6 Qc5 20.
