1. g3 {Benko's opening.} d5 2. Bg2 {Nf3 is slightly better, according to the chess database.} e6 3. Nf3 {:)} Bd6 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6. Bg5 {The database prefers Nbd2, though I see nothing wrong with this.} Be7 7. Ne5 {Viccavdo vs. Rainster, Viccavdo played Nbd2 here, ultimately defeating Rainster.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16640162&mv=12&rnd=0.45545266830871034} Nbd7 8. Nxd7 Nxd7 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. c4 dxc4 11. dxc4 Rd8 12. Qc2 c6 13. Nd2 Ne5 14. Nf3 Qc5 15. b3 h6 16. Nxe5 Qxe5 17. Rad1 Bd7 18. Rd2 f5 19. Rfd1 Qc7 20. Qc3 Be8 21. Rd2d3 Rxd3 22. Rxd3 Rd8 23. Qd2 Rxd3 24. Qxd3 Bg6 25. Qe3 {Nice.  I wasn't sure at first why white moved the queen, but this simultaneously attacks Pe6 & Pa7.  Black must choose which to lose.} e5 26. Qd2 {?  Why not QxPa7?  Juicy pawn ripe for the plucking.  Black wasn't attacking anything.} e4 27. f3 Qb6+ 28. Kf1 exf3 29. exf3 Qc7 30. f4 h5 31. Qe3 b6 32. Qe6+ Kh7 {Here Pc6 is vulnerable, by either the queen or the bishop.} 33. Qxc6 {Good choice.} Qd8 34. Qd5 Qf6 35. Qe5 Qf8 36. Qb2 Qd6 37. Ke2 h4 38. Bd5 Qc5 39. Qe5 hxg3 40. hxg3 Bh5+ 41. Kd3 Qf2 42. Qxf5+ {White's queen is potentially pinned against his king with this blunder.  Qe6 would cost white a pawn, possibly two, but improve odds for the end game.} Bg6 {}
