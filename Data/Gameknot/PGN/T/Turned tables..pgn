1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 {I have more and more doubts about the Icelandic Gambit. } 4. dxe6 Bxe6 5. h3 {Not as strong as other moves, but still it will help white's position later. } Bd6 {I have no other good square to get the bishop out. Both in c5 or b4 it will be easily and usefully kicked away by white. } 6. Nc3 Qe7 {Instead of protecting my bishop pair with a3 (avoiding Nb5), I go for the typical "Icelandic Threat". } 7. d4 {White falls for it. Now black has to choose whether if to go for the pawn with Bxh6+, taking advantage of the fact that if white shields with the bishop, apparently Bxg2 wins a piece, that seemed good, but what after white shields with the dsb? I could leave him an useful semiopen column to his advantage in the future.} Bc4+ {So I played this one. } 8. Be3 {Obviously. Here you can see why h3 wasn't such a bad move. } Bxf1 {Well: there is a chance that he retakes with the rook - better for me, I thought - or with the king. } 9. Rxf1 {So I though this was better for me, because of...} Bf4 {It looks promising, doesn't it?} 10. Qd2 {Ok, but in fact... what will happen? White will castle queenside, and I will have nothing. This starts to look suspicious. I have to find an alternate plan, but where?} O-O {At a loss, I castled. Instead of developing. Maybe trying to castle queenside would have been wiser. } 11. O-O-O Bd6 {I'll dreamed to redirect my forces against the enemy's king, but with no solid plan. It was a mistake, since white does have one. } 12. Bg5 {Correctly. Now I have to sweat to control Nd5, and I didn't. } h6 {I couldn't calculate it accurately, but I hoped that if Nd5, I could have been doomed with the opening of my king's pawn's shield. Maybe better would have been c6. } 13. Bh4 {Tempting me to go g4, to sacrifice. I am not sure, but I preferred not to risk too much. } Nbd7 {This has the counter to leave the queen with few squares to go after Rd1. But I hoped that with correct play I could have survived. Suddenly, I am in serious danger. } 14. Nd5 {Qe6 or Qe4 were good to analyze, but not on a blitz, for me...} Qd8 15. Nxf6+ Nxf6 {That was a mistake on white's side. Now the situation is the same, but white doesn't have any knight to press f6. And black's pawns are still in their place. } 16. Rde1 Be7 {This is the way I thought I could get out of here. After c4, Nd5 and... "atomic bomb": changes will start, and I think we could end roughly "even"... but for the "residual advantages" I couldn't calculate...} 17. Ne5 Qd5 {Time to go to attack. Two pawns at the same time. } 18. f4 {Strong move, I would say. I'm not sure if Qxa7 is wise, after Qc3, my queen is doing little job up there, while white's attack goes on undisturbed. } Ne4 {So I threw in this "atomic bomb": it forces a plethora of exchanges, whose tactic are fun and interesting to analyze. I threat a queen, but white has BxB for free and then BxR. On the other side, the Knight has NxR on the next move, so it won't work for white. He has to move the queen, and in doing so he must threat the knight so to keep the balance after BxBh4. Now, I think that I would have played c4, as white, as a way to create complications. It is then black that has to consider BxB, cxQ, BxR, but it is a dead end. Otherwise, NxQ, cxQ, NxR, BxB, Re8, losing the exchange... very funny. } 19. Qd3 {White goes for this one. } Bxh4 {I like the dsb in this position, I'm glad to keep it. } 20. Rxe4 {Ok. I am -1, and I can't say my position is preferable to white's: he is occupying the center, threats c4, with a massive dominance... in other words: I'm not already lost, but surely is a line I won't like to repeat. What can I do now? Again, Qxa2 seems like desperate. b5 (to counter c4) could be considered. c5 too. Rd8... a lot of moves, and a blitz!} Qxa2 {Sometimes it is whorthy to sacre the opponent :-)} 21. g3 {White has a good idea, but overlooks a tactical shot.} Bxg3 {If QxB, I win the rook f1 after Qa1+. White's mistake can be depressing, but i think that it was not enough to resign. White still has an edge, here. After b3, the black queen is out of the defence of the king, and white has plenty of game at the kingside, provided he is careful with his backrank (Kd2 can be a good option in the near future). So that's the lesson: don't resign just because something went wrong, if not disastrous. Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed. }
