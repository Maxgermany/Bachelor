[Opening "English (A22), Bellon gambit"]

1. c4 e5 {The 'Pawn to King Four' Defence against White's English Opening.  For many years the English was my favoured opening as White, but as Black I liked to meet it with this defence - as aggressive as the Sicilian is against 1.e4.} 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 {So far, a standard development, but now Black departs from the usual lines of play...} e4 {(?!) Playable, but rather a risky line.  If Black wants a tough fight on his hands, this is a good way to get one! } 4. Ng5 {The usual response, planning to take on e4 with this knight.   Other options that have been tries are 4.Nd4 and even 4.Ng1.  There seems to be no reason, however, not to choose the move played.} Bc5 {(!?) Oddly enough, the most popular response here seems to be 4...b5!?  The idea is, presumably, to decoy if possible, White's c-pawn, or maybe the c3-knight. White can choose from 5.Nxb5 and 5.d3 - both being good responses.   With the move played, Black definitely gambits a pawn, leaving both sides in uncharted territory.  } 5. Ngxe4 Bb6 {(!?)} 6. g3 {(!?) Well worth considering were 6.Nxf6  and 6.c5.} c6 {(?!) Very risky, as with 7.Nd6  Ke7 8.Nxc8  Qxc8 9.Bg2 Black would be unable to castle.  True, that is not a huge handicap, as with ...Re8 and ...Kf8 Black achieves adequate protection for the king, but it does lose time that White can use to complete his development and plan an attack.} 7. d3 {(!?) Though 7.Nd6  was good, this seems a reasonable alternative.  But now Black breaks out in the centre - a very good plan...} Nxe4 8. Nxe4 d5 {(!) Well played.  This break goes a long way to freeing up Black's Q-side and developing some counterplay.} 9. Nd2 Nd7 {(!?) "Knights before bishops" on any given side ot the board is a useful guideline, but this is one of the exceptions, I feel.  Preferable was 9...Be6 first, and then develop the knight.  However, Black had already planned to move the knight on to f6, so the bishop will soon be free to move...} 10. b3 {(??) A bad mistake that could have cost White the game.  Better was 10.cxd5 cxd5, leaving Black with an isolated d-pawn to worry about (11.Bg2 attacks it immediately).  Now Black can win material...} Nf6 {(?) According to a plan already laid, I suspect.  But it's always worth re-evaluating any given position in the light of what your opponent actually plays.  White's last opened himself up to a deadly double-attack: 10...Qf6!  To stop the mate at f2, White would have to give up his rook at a1. } 11. Qc2 {(?!) This also has its downside, as Black shows next turn...} Ng4 {(!) Good: attacking the vulnerable spot at f2.} 12. c5 {(?) The last couple of moves have revivified the threat mentioned at move 10.  Instead, 12.e3 seems a better choice.} Ba5 {(?) Again, 12...Qf6! would have been embarrassing for White: 13.Bb2 Qxf2  14.Kd1 Ne3#.  Note that 12...Bxc5 first would have been a mistake, as the WQ from c5 (13.Qxc5) would be protecting the f2-square.} 13. Bb2 {Now the opportunity is gone for good.} Bxd2+ {(?) Not a well-motivated exchange, in my view.  This bishop was the more mobile of Black's pair (consider where the Black pawns are standing - the colour of the squares), and was worth a deal more than White's knight.  The exchange also cedes White the bishop pair - an asset easily overrated, but an unnecessary concession all the same.  Better was 13...0-0 or 13...Nf6 to protect the g-pawn from capture.} 14. Qxd2 {Of course, it was too much to hope that White would retake with the king!} O-O 15. Bg2 {A good moment to assess the overall situation, since both sides are close to completing their development.  White is a pawn ahead.  That Black has nothing to show at least partially to offset this, indicates White has the advantage.  Black will have to play hard to close the gap!} b6 {(!?) Mobilising his Q-side.  With this move, Black makes it clear he isn't going to lie down, even though his plan does have its risks.  Also possible were 15...Qe7 or 15...Re8, but it is by no means clear they are any better than the move played.} 16. Qc3 {(!) Not just a transparent, easily parried threat (17.Qxg7#).  White plans to make use of the c-file to bear down upon Black's backward c-pawn that will soon appear in the file.} Nf6 17. cxb6 Qxb6 {It was no good taking with the pawn, of course!} 18. O-O Rd8 19. Rac1 Bb7 {As good a place for the bishop as any.  Black has now a 'hanging pawn couple' (Nimzovitch), the backward pawn of which at c6 is under heavy attack.  Black has somehow to mobilise these pawns - a tall order!} 20. Rfe1 Rac8 21. Ba1 {(?!) An imaginative idea that says much about White's flexibility of thought together with fixity of purpose.  White wants to maintain the pressure on the long diagonal, but to bring his rooks into the front line of the attack down the c-file.  But there is one small consideration that White has overlooked that, had he seen it, would have made him wait a move.  The right move was 21.b4!, because...} c5 {(!) ... a White pawn on b4 would have held the c-pawn backward and vulnerable.  Black takes immediate advantage of the omission.} 22. Qb2 {(!?) The foregoing is not to say that Black was out of the woods yet.  With 22.d4, White could still have faced Black with the problem of his vulnerable pawns, e.g. 22.d4 c4 23.bxc4 Rxc4 24.Qb2 Rb4 Black would have lively play, and have masked the weakness of his d-pawn (having rid himself altogether of his backward c-pawn), yet White still has that niggling pawn surplus, and no real weakness for Black to attack.} d4 {(!) Now, I rather like this move, though it is true Black has brought back into existence a backward and vulnerable c-pawn.  Against that, Black has closed down the long dark-square diagonal, for the time being at least.} 23. Bxb7 Qxb7 24. Rc4 Nd5 {Black has his beady eye on ...Nc3 - an attractive-looking prospect.  But it seems to me that Black's central pawn structure is too unstable for the knight to achieve much there.  Apart from that, the rooks can offer no protection for the knight at c3 either.  Maybe 24...Qd7, centralising and overprotecting d4 would have been worth a look.} 25. e3 {(!?) Immediately attacking Black's shaky pawn centre.  Yet there was a lot to be said for regrouping a bit first.  25.Qc1! added pressure against the c-pawn whilst covering the c3 and e3 squares.  Less effective would have been 25.Rec1 (25...Qe7). } Rde8 {(?) Pinning the e-pawn (26.exd4?? Rxe1ch ).  But the move is a mistake, although the reason is not at all easy to spot!  Better was 25...Qe7, with the same idea of pinning the e-pawn.} 26. Rec1 {Obvious and good, but even better was this tactical shot: 26.Rxc5!! with the idea 26...Rxc5? 27.Qxd4! with a double attack against the c5-rook and against g7 (28.Qxg7#).  This motif forms a curious pendant to the similar double attack opportunities Black had earlier in the game!} Nc3 {As planned, and it looks good, but the knight can't stay there after, say, 27.Qd2.  Maybe 26...Nb4 might have given White more to think about...?} 27. Rc1xc3 {(?!)  A very interesting decision.  It is often worth considering trading down 'at a loss', in order to bring about a more easily realised advantage, or in the interests of simpler planning.  This can be especially useful if the defender is otherwise finding plenty of counterplay.  Possibly White was impressed by the counterplay Black had recently conjured up, which makes the exchange offer understandable.  At that, White may have been figuring on getting 2 pawns for the exchange, and hence preserving his material edge.  All the same, 27.Qd2 looks much the better option.} dxc3 28. Qxc3 f6 {Black had to cover the mate threat at g7, whereat White now picks up the c-pawn...} 29. Rxc5 Rxc5 30. Qxc5 Rc8 {(!) } 31. Qa3 {(!) Just about White's only good move in this position.} Qc6 {Playing to win maybe?  Black could have won a piece here by 31...Qf3! 32.Qb2 Qd1ch  33.Kg2 Rc1, but then White can hold everything together by 34.Qd4 Rxa1 35.Qd8ch  Kf7 36.Qd5ch ! with a perpetual check (Not 36.Qd7ch? Kg6  37.Qg4ch?? Qxg4). This would have been a nice exciting tactical finish to the game.  But, whether or not Black considered this line, he's not compromising much by trying other methods.} 32. Bb2 Qc5 {Possibly this offer ought to be avoided here, although it is true that the exchange comes later with no ill-effects to Black... Ordinarily the defender (Black) does best to keep pieces on, and look to exchanging pawns.} 33. b4 {(!) Personally, I would have exchanged queens, but this seems very good, decoying the BQ away from protecting the a-pawn.} Qc2 34. Bd4 {There seems to be no saving the a-pawn unless Black forces the queens off.} Qc1+ 35. Qxc1 Rxc1+ 36. Kg2 a6 37. a4 {(!?) White has preserved a small material edge (B 3P ~ R), and this move looks the logical one to create a second passed pawn on the Q-side.  But it will cost the passer already in existence at d3.  Could White have improved here with 37.Kf3 instead?  E.g. 37.Kf3 Rc2 38.a4 Rd2 39.Ke4 Rxf2 40.b5 axb5 41.axb5 or 37...Rd1 38.Ke2 are by no means definitive sample lines.   The main idea is to steal a march on Black's King in the race for the centre and subsequently the Q-side.} Rd1 {From here on, play is straightforward and easy to follow: White creates and tries to advance his remote passed pawn on the b-file; Black grabs the d-pawn then holds up the b-pawn's progress.} 38. b5 axb5 39. axb5 Rxd3 40. b6 Rb3 41. Kf3 Kf7 42. Ke4 Ke6 {At this point the players agreed the draw.  Although White has the initiative, it seems to me doubtful that he can make sufficient  progress that will create winning chances for him.  The friendly handshake seems a fair reflection of the game: White having the advantage for most of it, but with Black contesting every inch of the way.}
