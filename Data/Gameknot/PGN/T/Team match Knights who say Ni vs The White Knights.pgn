1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Qc7 4. O-O a6 5. Bxc6 dxc6 {black interestingly decides to take back away from the centre, which allows him to develop his light-squared bishop more quickly, but also allows white to set up a fianchetto at the a1-h8 diagonal and get a strong centre. } 6. b3 Bg4 7. Bb2 Bxf3 8. Qxf3 {It is not really clear to me why black would seek to make this trade, nor why he would necessarily do it right now. This allows white to develop his queen 'for free'} e5 9. Qg3 f6 {further restricting the power of the dark squared bishop.} 10. d3 {as the a1-h8 diagonal is important to gain control over the centre, I want to develop my knight outside of it} O-O-O 11. Qg4+ {At this point, my short term strategic goal would be to create a passed pawn in the centre. Therefore, I want to makew room for g3 and f4. } Kb8 12. g3 h5 13. Qe2 {Queen now moves back to safety to prevent black can use little attacks at the queen to further his king side attack } Qd7 {Black leaves the way open for white to play f4. Preventing it would have been an option with 13.... Bd6, but this could haev been fought with Nd2-c4 and if black would want to prevent that with 14....b5, white gets a nice new point of attack, by going for opening up the a-file with 15. a4} 14. f4 exf4 15. gxf4 h4 16. Nd2 {e5 won't easily be stopped, so finishing development before opening up the position seems prudent.} Rh6 17. e5 Rg6+ 18. Kh1 fxe5 {Black has an interesting choice here between 18....f5 and 18....xe5. The former leaves a passed pawn that is supported by another pawn, but the chosen move allows white to get very active pieces along the f-file. The fact that f5 also blocks black's access to the king side may be the deciding factor in favor of the played move.} 19. fxe5 {The short term goal has been reached. Now white should aim to generate active pieces around the passed pawn, while black should make sure the pawn will be blocked until the end game is reached and the king might be able to collect it.} Re8 20. Nf3 {Strong defense of the pawn will make sure no pieces are tied down to its defense and keeps the pieces fluid enough to move to more active squares at opportune moments.} h3 21. Rfg1 {the weak square g2 must be protected.} Rh6 {exchange may have been better, as white now gets two very active rooks} 22. Raf1 {getting the other rook involved in the game} Nf6 23. Ng5 {I had no good place to move the queen to in order to take away the pin on the e-pawn, so this move serves the dual purpose of creating more space for the queen and making the knight more active.} Nh7 24. Ne4 {White would like to play for Rf7 in this position instead, but after 24. Rf7 Re7 25. e6 Qd5+, it feels like I am not really making any progress and I have simply weakened my position. Retreating to e4 also makes no direct progress, but at least I still have rather active pieces, especially compared to black's bishop and knight.} Ree6 25. Qg4 {I this position, it may have been better to try to relocate the bishop via c1, especially considering that it may be done while attacking the awkwardly placed h6 rook now, but that black will likely attempt to make some trades later on.} Qe8 {covers g6, but takes away the option of getting to d5 to take advantage of the problematic diagonal h1-d5.} 26. Ng3 {The knight can now move away from the diagonal and get to the strong square f5} Be7 27. Nf5 Reg6 28. Qf4 {This places the queen in the same diagonal with the king. This slightly limits black's options, but creating a direct counter threat with Qf3, hitting h3 might have been more forceful. } Rxg1+ 29. Rxg1 Rg6 30. Nxe7 {Given the tempi that black can create (either through check at g1 or with a mate threat on g2 after 31. Kxg6 Qxg6), this only leads to simple exchanges. At the moment I considered this reasonable, as I expected to win the pawn on h3, but as we will see later, this isn't very valuable, so avoiding the exchange altogether with 30. Rf1 in order to create danger through the f-file and by pushing the e-pawn onward. Nxg7 could also have created some more danger, as it would mean that the h-pawn is actually crucially important since subsequently losing that would mean white gets an extra passed pawn. As it was played, the position looked less and less winable.} Rxg1+ 31. Kxg1 Qxe7 32. Qf5 {32. e6+ Kf8 33. Qg4 looks a bit more interesting, as after 34.... Qg5 35. Qxg5 Nxg5 36. Bxg7 Nxe6, white should be able to create a passed pawn on the h-file which leaves him very much a favourite to win and after 35....Ng5 the exchange can also occur because after 36. Bxg7, Qxg7 is not allowed because of 37. e7+ Kc7 (38. e8Q+ after either Ne6 or Kc8) 38. e8N+. Of course 32. e6+ may also be answered with Kh8 or Kh7, but in that case white can respond with Qe5, which will again most likely lead to an exchange between e6 and g7 with the added benefit that the blck king is now in a less active position, making the white end game a little bit better.} Qg5+ {Black is mostly playing for a draw and the less pieces are on the board, the easier it will be to create blockades for the passed pawn.} 33. Qxg5 Nxg5 34. Kf2 Ne6 {Now black's problems all seem resolved. He is about to lose the pawn on h3, but white can not easily find progress, so black may very well be able to play this towards a draw now.} 35. Kg3 Kc7 36. Kxh3 {While white is now a pawn ahead, how can he turn this into a win? The knight on e6 seems to perfectly block everything.} Kd7 37. Kg4 Ke7 38. h4 {To control g5, but it would probably have been better to play Kf5 first. The king can be forced away by 38... Kf7 39. h4 g6, but at that point the king can move to e5, which would be better, since it has no real purpose on the locked up king side.} g6 39. c3 {takes away d4 as a potential square for the knight } Kf7 40. b4 {After the exchange, white can try to move his king towards e4 and then try to move up the d-pawn to attempt to get the king behind the ranks. It still seems rather drawish, but I couldn't find a better line, either.} cxb4 41. cxb4 c5 {This seems to make things unnecessarily easy for white. The trade creates two connected passed panws. More resilient would have been 41...b5, which locks down the position with all of black's pawns on light squares, where they are invaulnerable to the white bishop. At that point white might try to get behind enemy lines with the king through e4 and abusing zugzwang. I am not entirely certain that it will actually lead to a win unequivocally or that it is a theoreticl draw and I merely misplayed the following variations. In any case, b5 would certainly allow white to mess up.} 42. bxc5 Nxc5 43. d4 Nd3 44. Bc3 b6 45. d5 {Black resigns. Although the material is equal and there are no direct threats, the two connected passed pawns that white has at his disposal will most likely be able to secure the win by tying down the knight and the king preventing them to reach the 8th row, which means for example that g6 will most likely fall. }
