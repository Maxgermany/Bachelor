Bxf4 {This is where this game diverges from the previous one.} Bxf4 {Never one to hoard material, Marshall elects to sacrifice his Queen in return for a strong attacking position against Swiderski's exposed King.} 13. Rxe7+ Kxe7 14. Qf3 {Swiderski hastens to bring his forces over to defend. Now once the QN moves, the QR can defend the 1st rank.} Be3+ 15. Kh1 f5 16. Na3 Nf2+ 17. Kg1 Ng4+ 18. Kh1 f4 {Marshall presses forward.} 19. Nc2 Nf2+ 20. Kg1 Bg4 {Not only adding another piece to the attack against the King, but also forcing the Queen away from the defense.} 21. d6+ cxd6 22.
