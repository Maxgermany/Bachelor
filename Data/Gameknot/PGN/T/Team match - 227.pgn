1. e4 {After an interesting skirmish in the middle game featuring some inaccuracies on both sides, this game wound down to a R+N v R ending. In researching the internet, I found that the stronger side can rarely win, but that the best move for both sides is sometimes far from obvious. So, of course, I was anxious to feed this into the GK analyzer (the only computer program I have available) to see if it could find better moves in the ending.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Be7 {I have had less personal success with the common and more aggressive ... Bd6 which has the disadvantage of leaving Black's d pawn somewhat vulnerable.} 7. O-O Nc6 8. c4 Nf6 9. Nc3 Be6 10. c5 {Somewhat unexpected. I expected 10. cxd5 which seems to be more commonly played.} a6 {Here I am following Marco vs. Eduardas, Malaga op 3rd, which ended in a win for Black. In that game, White continued 11. a3 which seems rather pointless.} 11. Re1 O-O 12. Ng5 {The computer doesn't much like this, and I agree. It gives Qa4 with a slight advantage for White.} Bg4 13. f3 Bh5 14. g4 Bg6 15. Nh3 Bxd3 16. Qxd3 Qd7 17. Nf4 Nb4 {Now it is Black's turn to err. I must have had the optical illusion that I needed to do something drastic about my d pawn. The computer gives ... h6 with equality.} 18. Qd2 g5 {Played because of the same illusion as my 17th move. ...h6 is still best.} 19. a3 {This drives the Knight to where it needs to go anyway. The computer prefers 19 Nh3 h6 20 Nxg5 after which hxg5 seems to fail to 21. Qxg5+ Kh7 22. Qh4+ Kg8 23.Bg5} Nc6 20. Nd3 {The computer passed this over without comment. Nh3 seems interesting, e.g. h6 21. Nxg5 Nxg4 22. Nh3 Ne3 23. Nf4 Bf6 24. Rxe3 Bxd4. I may well be missing something here.} Nxd4 21. Ne5 {The text wins a piece, but at the cost of too many pawns. The computer likes Qxg5 better.} Nxf3+ 22. Nxf3 Qxg4+ 23. Qg2 Bxc5+ 24. Kh1 Qxg2+ 25. Kxg2 g4 26. Nh4 c6 27. Bh6 {Again, driving the Rook where it wants to go! The computer gives Bg5} Rfe8 28. Bg5 Rxe1 29. Rxe1 Re8 30. Rf1 {The computer thinks that White should have exchanged Rooks. I am not totally convinced.} Ne4 31. Nxe4 Rxe4 32. Nf5 Bf8 33. Ng3 Re5 {Now it is Black's turn to return the favor by driving the Bishop where it wants to go! According to the computer, Black retains a slight advantage by ... Re6, but after this move White is better.} 34. Bf6 Re6 35. Rf4 Bg7 36. Nh5 Bxf6 37. Nxf6+ Kg7 38. Nxg4 h5 {In this way, Black obtains the 7th rank. On an immediate ... Re2+, White plays Rf2.} 39. Nf2 Re2 40. b4 f6 41. Rf3 Kg6 42. Kg3 Rc2 43. h4 {This seemed wrong to me at the time, but it's actually quite good. It virtually ensures that White will eventually win Black's h pawn.} Rc4 44. Nd3 b6 {The computer didn't like this naturally looking move. On the contrary I think it worked out pretty well.} 45. Nf4+ Kh6 46. Re3 a5 {Black needs to exchange as many pawns as possible.} 47. Re6 Rc3+ 48. Kf2 d4 49. Rxf6+ Kh7 50. Nxh5 Rxa3 51. Rxc6 axb4 52. Rxb6 {After the mayhem, Black has only one pawn for the Knight. But he only has to eliminate one White pawn to achieve his goal!} Rh3 53. Rb7+ Kg8 54. Nf6+ Kf8 55. h5 b3 56. Kg2 {At the time I thought this might be a blunder. However the computer passed it over without comment. It seems that Black will achieve a draw regardless.} d3 57. Rxb3 {After playing quite quickly for a number of moves, White suddenly paused before playing this move. Perhaps he did not see that the rook is poisoned?} d2 58. Rb1 Rd3 59. Rd1 Kg7 60. Ne4 {The computer likes Ng4 better, but in the line it gives Black eliminates the pawn anyway and achieves a draw.} Kh6 61. Nxd2 Kxh5 {Whew! Mission accomplished!} 62. Kf2 Kg4 {Since Black's King is out of the corner and there are no Knight forks in sight, the draw is not that complicated. Black's strategy is to keep the Rook far from his King to avoid any forks and harass the White King with checks.} 63. Ke2 {In the ensuing struggle, the computer finds no inaccuracies on either side. Do you agree?} Rd8 64. Ke3 Ra8 65. Rg1+ Kf5 66. Nc4 Re8+ 67. Kf3 Rb8 68. Ne3+ Ke5 69. Rg5+ Kf6 70. Rc5 Rb3 71. Ke4 Rb4+ 72. Nc4 Rb1 73. Rc6+ Kg5 74. Ne3 Rb4+ 75. Ke5 Rb5+ 76. Nd5 Rb1 77. Ke4 Re1+ 78. Ne3 Ra1 79. Rc5+ Kg6 80. Kf4 Ra4+ 81. Nc4 Ra1 82. Rc6+ Kf7 83. Ne3 Ra4+ 84. Ke5 Ra1 85. Nd5 Re1+ 86. Kf5 Rf1+ 87. Nf4 Ke7 88. Rh6 Kd7 89. Rh7+ {With this White calls it a day and offers a draw.}
