Bd3 {i don't think I could have been more offensive than these moves. Maybe g and h pawns could have progressed too.} Nc6 10. Nb3 {At that time, I preferred to keep the complexity of the game, and avoid the exchanges of minor pieces.} Be7 {preparing the king side castle. But, was it a good idea?} 11. O-O O-O {to my opinion, the black king is seriously exposed, even without counting the mistakes black will make} 12. a3 {before attacking on the king side, i wanted to avoid the Nb4 move.} b5 {and black is obviously interested in this side of the game.} 13.
