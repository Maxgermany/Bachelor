1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian Defense.} 2. c3 a6 {...and this move is not in the database.  Black prevails just over half the time with dxe4.} 3. Bd3 c5 4. Ne2 Nc6 5. Ng3 e5 6. Be2 Nf6 7. d3 h6 8. O-O d4 9. cxd4 cxd4 10. a3 Bd6 11. Nf5 O-O 12. Bd2 Be6 13. h3 Qd7 14. g4 Rac8 15. b4 b5 16. Kg2 Ne7 17. g5 hxg5 {Interesting that it takes 17 moves before someone trades a piece.} 18. Bxg5 Nh7 19. Bxe7 Bxe7 20. Rh1 {:)} Bxf5 21. exf5 Qxf5 {While Bg4 pins the black queen against the rook, Qg5 or Qg6 prevent white's bishop from moving (the pinner itself is pinned against the white king).} 22. Bg4 Qg6 23. Kf1 {The castle on move 11 is almost entirely undone.  White might have been better off not castling.} f5 24. Bh5 Qe6 25. Rg1 Nf6 26. Rg6 {White dares black to take the bishop.} Qd5 {A dare black wisely declines.  The bishop is not in jeopardy--black would be foolish to trade knight for bishop and allow white so much power concentrated on the weakened fortress.} 27. Bf3 e4 28. Bg2 f4 29. dxe4 Nxe4 30. Nd2 Nxd2+ 31. Qxd2 Qf5 32. Rxa6 {With this capture white achieves material parity, temporarily.} f3 {This move pushes white's white bishop into the corner.    Qxh3+ puts black up a pawn again.} 33. Bh1 Qxh3+ 34. Kg1 Rf6 {I think Bf5 would have been a better choice.  White would be scrambling to defend against checkmate had black not offered this rook trade.  35. Rg6, Bd6 } 35. Rxf6 Bxf6 36. Qf4 d3 37. Rd1 {White moves the rook out of harm's way.} Rd8 38. Qxf3 Qxf3 39. Bxf3 Bb2 40. Be4 {Time to sweep up pawns.} d2 41. Bc6 Bxa3 42. Bxb5 Bxb4 43. Kf1 Rd5 {Big oops.  While black wants to keep the white king from crossing the e file (to attack Pd2), the pawn was safe.  When you threaten a piece, where will it move?  In this case the obvious spot is Bc4, which captures the black rook.} 44. Bc4 Kh7 45. Bxd5 Kg6 46. Ke2 Kf5 47. Ra1 {I think I like Rb1 or Bb3 better.  While black can defend both pawns from Bc3, white needs to get rid of a black pawn.} g5 48. Kd1 {Black cannot defend d1, the king seems better served blocking the advance of black's g pawn.} g4 49. Bg2 {If the black king advances black will lose the bishop.  Bc3 pushes the rook, but the black bishop must remain on the diagonal protecting the d pawn.  If white trades the rook for the bishop and pawn, black stands a slim chance of winning or at least getting a draw.  White's pawn and bishop protect e3 through h3, a line the black king cannot cross.  If black can trade the bishop and pawn for the white rook, white should be able to force mate (with a lot of moves) with the free moving bishop.} Bc5 {Oops again.  Black repeats the rook mistake with the bishop.} 50. Ra5 {}
