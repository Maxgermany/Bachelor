1. d4 {Another installment of the ongoing match between RemohGramps and myself. The title was set when the game began, and it is a reference to the fact that my opponent has yet to win any games against me since our first, which I timed out for personal reasons. He's vowed to keep going until he wins one. This time I'm white and, feeling adventurous, I stray from the epine dorsale and open with 1. d4.} d5 2. c4 {Queen's Gambit.} dxc4 3. Nf3 {Accepted. White plays the main line response.} Nc6 4. d5 {Black's 3. ... Nc6 is known as the Side Variation. The book response for white is 4. e4 to build the "classic" center and to threaten the pawn on f4, to which black replies 4. ... b5. I found 4. d5 in the GameKnot DB and it looked more fun, so I played it.} Na5 5. Qa4+ {Not looking good for that knight on the edge. On the edge of destruction...} c6 6. Bd2 {More pressure on that knight. It has nowhere to go. A knight anywhere on the edge of the board only had 4 moves (2 if it's in a corner or 3 if it's next to a corner). In this case, three of the black knight's moves are blocked by black pawns and the fourth, b3, is instant death by axb3. Best might be 6. ... b6 to defend the knight but this allows white to gain a pawn with 7. dxc6, though it's doubtful that white can hold onto that far-flung pawn.} b5 7. Qxa5 {White has gained a piece but will lose the pawn on d5, and now black seems to have built a stable defense for his pawn on f4, gaining a little compensation by way of the pawn black captured with 2. ... dxc4 and now denying white the opportunity to get it back.} Qxa5 8. Bxa5 cxd5 9. Nc3 {Forking the black pawns on b5 and d5.} Nf6 10. Nxb5 {Now threatening the fork on c7.} e6 11. Nc7+ {Black simply allows the fork with 10. ... e6. No doubt he correctly surmised that he couldn't stop 11. Nc7, and it looks like black has no way to prevent the loss of material. Not with 10. ... Kd7 for then 11. Ne5+ Ke6 12. Nc7+ Kxe5 13. Nxa8 still wins the exchange for white, and black cannot seem to trap and win the knight on a8. Not 10. ... Rb8 11. Nc7+ Kd7 12. Ne5+ Kd6 13. Nxf7+ Kc6 14. Nxh8 Rb7 15. Nf7 Rxc7 16. Bxc7 Kxc7 17. Ne5 which wins a whole rook for white.} Kd7 12. Nxa8 Bd6 13. O-O-O {The white knight on a8 is well and good cooked, so might as well develop some pieces. This isn't the safest castle position, but I feel I've inflicted enough damage to black's queenside to make it unlikely he can launch a scary attack against the exposed king. The rook on d1 might create a pin on the d5 pawn, if things work out right, which may allow the white bishop on f1 to capture on f4 in a few moves. } h6 14. e3 Bb7 15. Nb6+ {Black finally pounces on the trapped white knight. White plays 15. Nb6+ for no other reason than to gain the a7 pawn after it captures the knight, thus trading the knight for a pawn rather than losing it outright.} axb6 16. Bxb6 {Now white is up by a whole rook.} Rc8 17. Be2 {I was afraid of black playing 16. ... Ne4, threatening 17. ... Nxf2 and forking the two white rooks. I could prevent the fork, but I could see no way to the loss of the pawn on f2 (well, I could have prevented it by playing 15. Be2 instead of 15. Nb6+, but I didn't see the threat then). I did see the threat while I was waiting for black's 16th move, but it was too late to stop it then. But, black played 16. ... Rc8 so I waste no time in clearing f1 so I can play a rook there to defend the f2 pawn if needed.} Ne4 18. Rdf1 {Whew.} c3 19. Bd4 {I'm not sure if 19. Bd4 was the best move here, but I thought I may want that bishop home to help with the defense, something it was unable to do from b6. Besides, a threat against g7 might tempt black to spend a tempo saving the pawn. Or, white might eventually just capture that pawn, gaining material and isolating black's h-pawn.} cxb2+ 20. Kxb2 Rb8 21. Ka1 {Black threatened 21. ... Ba6+ (discovered) followed by 22. ... Bxe2. The white king seeks a defender to hide behind.} Rc8 22. Bd3 {Limiting black's approaches for his rook on the open c-file and putting pressure on black's knight at e4.} e5 23. Nxe5+ {Black's move, 22. ... e5? was a minor blunder. The pawn at e5 is inadequately protected. I feel my bishop is more crucial to my defense than the knight, and I would like to play the pawn to f3 to drive off black's knight, so capturing the pawn at e5 with the white knight seems the best option.} Ke6 24. Ng4 {Because I still want f3 open for a pawn. I realized before I played the move that black can trap the white knight with 24. ... f5, but I believed I could get three pawns in compensation for it (counting the pawn it captured on e5 as the first of the three). A belief that might very well have cost me the win in this game.} f5 25. Bxg7 {Pawn number two.} fxg4 26. Bxe4 dxe4 27. Bxh6 {Pawn number three. This move, 27. Bxh6? might have cost me the win. It might even deserve two ? for how bad it is. I looked long and hard at taking this pawn (at least for two whole minutes). I knew better. The white DSB needs to remain on the long diagonal a1-h8 to prevent black from getting his DSB on it. The damage black can do with two bishops and a rook against white's lone king is scary. I thought about it, then decided I could get away with it. It was the wrong choice. White should have played 27. Bd4, or simply left the bishop on g7 for now and brought his rooks into a more active role.} Bd5 28. Rfc1 {Another mistake. White must get his DSB on that long diagonal.} Be5+ 29. Kb1 {Too late. White allowed black to play 28. ... Be5+! uncontested by the white bishop. Much badness follows.} Rb8+ 30. Kc2 Bxa2 31. h3 {One dead pawn. If nothing else, black has traded his isolated h-pawn for white's passed a-pawn, thanks to white's dubious 27. Bxh6?, which makes that an even pawn trade, but black isn't done. White's bishop on h6 is useless as a defender, and black still has three pieces attacking the exposed white king. White intends to run his king all the way to the kingside, and I feel he can get there, so I play 31. h3? looking to create a passed pawn. But I think 31. Kd1 was called for here to prevent the immediate loss of more material.} gxh3 32. gxh3 Rb2+ 33. Kd1 {Too late.} Rxf2 {Another white pawn falls. Now that 27. Bxh6? (with sloppy white moves that followed) has cost white two pawns, rather than gaining one. And now white has no kingside shelter to run to.} 34. Bf4 {Finally white makes a good move, of sorts. Black has all kinds of scary threats, and white really wants to play Rh2 forcing the trade of rooks. after 34. ... Bxf4 35. exf4 Rxf4, white will have lost a third pawn thanks to 27. Bxh6?, but now at least black's attack will have been adequately blunted to allow white room to breathe. However, white will only be up by the exchange, not much to bank on for winning an otherwise even endgame. Worse, white's only pawn is on the h-file, very difficult to promote, while black's pawn is centrally located on the e-file, much easier to promote. To whites benefit, black's only bishop does not control either promotion square. White might be able to work out a win, but there's a good chance this game will end in a draw.} Bf6 35. Rh2 {I am not sure why black chose not to win white's e-pawn as previously noted with 34. Bxf4. Whtie capitalizes by skewering the black rook to his bishop, thinking this forces the exchange of rooks which would greatly favor white.} Bb3+ 36. Ke1 {Black found his zwischenzug, moving his bishop with check which breaks the skewer and avoids the rook exchange.} Rf3 37. Ke2 {Black's rook has nowhere to go. Trapped. White wants to attack it with a rook and force the exchange, but not with 38. Rf1?? which loses a rook to 38. ... Bc4+! and not 38. Rf2? which loses a pawn to 38. ... Rxh3. Well, at least the black rook is stuck for now.} Be7 38. h4 {Might as well see what this passed pawn can do.} Bd6 39. Rc6 {Black blundered with 38. ... Bd6??. Clearly, he wanted to exchange bishops with white, freeing his rook in the process. But white's reply wins the black bishop for free.} Kd5 40. Rxd6+ Kc4 41. Rd4+ {To win the last black pawn.} Kc3 42. Rxe4 {And now black's rook is cooked. It has nowhere to run. Black could try 42. ... Bc4+?, hoping to drive off white's king, but white would reply 43. Rxc4+ Kxc4, 44. Kxf3 and win easily with a rook, bishop, and two pawns against black's lone king.} Rxf4 43. exf4 {Black at least sold his doomed rook for the price of a bishop. Now the endgame is brutally easy. Advance the passed pawns, look for an opportunity to trade a rook for the last black bishop, then either promote a pawn and checkmate with queen+rook or simply go for the king+rook checkmate without promoting any pawns. Black took this opportunity to resign.}
