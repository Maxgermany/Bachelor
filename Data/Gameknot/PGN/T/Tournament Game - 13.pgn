Bxe7 Nxe7 {A lot of wood has suddenly come off the board, and it looks like a drawish game is forming up. But...} 14. Re1 {Steinitz seizes the open file and pins the Knight. Now the game begins to get highly tactical.} f6 {Intending, presumably, to "castle by hand".} 15. Qe2 {Attack...} Qd7 {...and riposte.} 16. Rac1 {Seizing the half-open QB file and activating his QR.} c6 {Sealing off the QB file as an invasion route.} 17. d5 {Intending N-Q4 and if allowed N-K6.} cxd5 {Now the QB file is opened to the fire of Steinitz's QR.} 18. Nd4 {Initiating the Knight maneuver.} Kf7 {Unpinning the Knight and clearing the way for a Rook to land at K1 for defense.} 19.
