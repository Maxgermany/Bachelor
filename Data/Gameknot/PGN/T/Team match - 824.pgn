[Opening "Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation"]

1. e4 {An invitation for a tactical battle is made. White controls f5 and d5. The pawn is not protected. The bishop line is opened for piece development.} c5 {The start of a Sicilian opening. Counter attacking the center using the flank pawn. Black controls b4 and d4. The pawn is unprotected. The idea is to trade flank for center pawn by d2-d4, c5xd4 or influence the center if no trade is offered. The queen line is opened. Note an important feature of the move c7-c5 is that the knight can be developed behind the pawn.} 2. Nf3 {The king knight is developed which is good preparation for 0-0. The knight controls e5 and has a little influence on d4 which offers strength to the move d2-d4. White has a gain in piece development specifically because of developing king side pieces.} Nc6 {Black continues the flank pressure on the center while developing a piece. The knight adds control to d4 of +4 points or 2 pieces. This will balance the equation if d2-d4 and will result in an even material trade, but will result in a positional gain of flank vs center pawn to the favor of black. There is an imbalance of piece development vs positional development in this opening by design.} 3. d4 {White chooses the most common reply. The pawn at d4 is covered by both queen and knight. An exchange of pawns is expected because white exerts control over much of the center and black will need to seek balance in central control by eliminating the d4 pawn.} cxd4 4. c3 {The standard Nf3xd4 is the usual move, but here white tries a gambit pawn move with the idea of gaining even greater piece development. The idea is an interesting diversion to the main lines. The plan is d4xc3, Nb1xc3 !? with development, but a weakening of center control that would have been offered by the c pawn.} dxc3 5. Nxc3 a6 {There are choices of moves available here including e7-e5 which helps to develop pieces. But the idea of a7-a6 is to prevent the c3 knight and f1 bishop from obtaining the use of b5, which in turn keeps the c6 knight and d7 pawn free. This move provides some resistance against piece development by white.} 6. Bc4 {White develops a piece in preparation for 0-0 by Bf1-c4 ?!, but this move carries the risk of losing a tempo from b7-b5. White may be betting that black will be determined to develop pieces before counter attacking. Perhaps white calculates b7-b5, Bc4-d5, e7-d6, Bxc6, dxc6, Qd1xd8, Kxd8 which gives some advantage to white because of the black king is in the open and the endgame is not quite in play yet. The position appears about equal positionally, but black has a slight material gain. The bishop and pawn offer +4 points control of d5 and also targets f7 as a possible future attack point. The bishop is unprotected.} e6 {This move works against the bishop and against any tactical ideas found by Nf3-g5 with f7 as the target of knight and bishop. This move opens the king bishop line to assist in developing pieces.} 7. Bf4 {White has no fear of a counter attack and continues to develop pieces. The bishop has some control of e5 and the threatening square g5. White is obtaining a great deal of influence and control of the center, but this is expected in this opening in which black shifts to attack later. The bishop is unprotected, the second piece to be so and could pose a potential problem.} f6 {Black shifts from an expected developing move and counters the control of e5. It is interesting to note that even without gains in piece development that black is in no danger from attack. It is true that black has a reserved position, but it is not necessarily limited because there are no pawn blockades in use by white. Black is playing defensively. This pawn move takes control of g5 and e5 from the f3 knight. Note that white can not develop either knight forward to the 5th rank. Petrosian is an influence here.} 8. e5 {White begins an attack in an attempt at breaking up the pawn structure. But is the idea really that good? White is using the last center pawn for the attack.} b5 {Black begins a counter attack on the previously mentioned weakly placed bishop.} 9. Bd3 {The choice for this move is based on Bc4-b3, Nc6-a5 attacking and gaining the bishop to secure a 2 bishop + knight vs 2 knight + bishop advantage. The move is good because it keeps the bishop centralized. The position may be attacked by Nc6-b4 driving the bishop to a less useful square, but that is a chance to take.} g5 {Black persists in the counter attack giving white no quarter.} 10. Bg3 {The choice of this square can be understood from the perspective of protecting the e5 pawn, but there is danger lurking in this position.} f5 {Black presses forward. Pawns can be very strong when backed by pieces and place a lot of pressure on nearby opponent pieces. The position seems a little better for black.} 11. h3 {A wise choice considering the rolling pawns.} h5 {A pawn storm in this position seems a good choice. Note how the queen at d1 is blocked from assisting by the f3 knight. Black still needs to work out some piece development, but notice how space is becoming more plentiful on the black side of the board, which means more mobility of pieces.} 12. Qd2 {White makes a move that is likely based on the pawn storm. The idea is 0-0-0 to get the king out of the center and away from the storm, which is a good idea, but the more optimal place for the queen should be c2 due to the potential for an attack on the black diagonal by Bf8-a6 and also h5-h4. Also the queen and bishop have strength together.} Bh6 {Black sets up a tactical shot.} 13. Qc2 {White finds the better square for the queen.} g4 {Still driving forward with the attack.} 14. hxg4 {White sacrifices cover to stay the attack.} hxg4 15. Nd2 Bg7 {The idea is simply to attack the d5 pawn while protecting the h8 rook while attacking the h1 rook. The pawn can not be taken until the g3 bishop has departed, but the move does apply pressure at 2 points on the board.} 16. O-O-O {White solves the rook protection by 0-0-0, but overlooks a problem.} Nd4 {Nd4! which drives the queen back away from the action.} 17. Qb1 Qc7 {Qc7! Pinning the knight with the idea of pressing an attack using the b pawn and a8 rook, while exerting some pressure on the e5 pawn.} 18. Rde1 {White gives the king an escape from the attack, but Bd3-d2 is better allowing the knight to escape the attack by the b pawn.} b4 {The knight will be captured because of the pin.} 19. Nc4 {Too late to block.} bxc3 {Black has a material gain and also some strong positional strengths, but white also has some positional strengths which can be found by looking at the g3 bishop, the c4 knight, and the 2 rooks. Black needs to limit the white pieces mobility while white needs to gain mobility and enhance protection of the king. The positional evaluation is -\+} 20. bxc3 Rb8 {Rb8! Further limiting the scope of the white queen.} 21. Qa1 Nb5 {Freeing the knight from the attack while keeping a loaded rook ready.} 22. f3 {White tries to achieve any black move, f3xg4, g5xg4, Bd3-g6+ with a small attack.} gxf3 {Keeping the d3 bishop as bad as possible by not giving up the f5 square.} 23. gxf3 Qc6 {With the tactical idea of f3-f4, Qc6-f3 skewer of both bishops.} 24. Rhf1 {White applies a solution, but drops control of the h file.} Rh3 {Rh3! building pressure. Black can not cover both the pawn and the bishop.} 25. Rfg1 {White protects the more valuable piece.} Qxf3 {Black gains some material, but more importantly gains even more positional pressure. Both bishops are threatened and indirectly the knight.} 26. Qb2 {White enacts a plan that involves keeping the g3 bishop, but losing the d3 bishop.} Qxd3 {There are 2 threats, Rh3xg3 and Qd3xc4 the better choice because it is free.} 27. Nd6+ {This move was forseen, and a choice had to be made of left or right. d8 seemed to offer the best results.} Kd8 28. Bf4 {Bf4! This was a good move which I did not really look at, likely because I was planning some elaborate mate. The bishop at g7 and the knight are both in a direct line of attack from the rook. The move also prevents the queen from using the e3 square in the event of moving the rook from e1.} Nd4 {Nd4! Offers the bait of a nice rook at b8, for which in return black can apply a mate at c2. I did not really think the rook would be taken, but this move was fun. There are only a few squares for the white queen to use safely.} 29. Qg2 {White overlooks a second resource for obtaining a mate.} Rb1# {Win 0-1. This was a very entertaining game with lots of turns and twists. There were many problems presented on the board which required some creative solutions. A good learning experience to see how the dynamics of opening choices unfold, and where positional and material gains are made. I believe that good piece placement makes a difference, but also applying a plan that works against the opponent plan goes a long way. I want to thank my opponent for a great game!}
