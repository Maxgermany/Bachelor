1. g3 {g3...pfffttt.  Come on.} f5 {Didn't expect that one, did ya?? } 2. Bg2 c6 3. b3 Nf6 4. Bb2 {OK, attack the Knight...one of his few moves I liked.} d5 {Took a chance here with a bad move.  If he takes my knight I'm in bad shape! } 5. Bd4 {He wimps out, sealing his own fate.} Qc7 6. f3 {What was that!!??? } e5 {And the game begins} 7. Bb2 Bd6 8. a3 {Uhhhhhh, what???  } O-O {Now, my king is safe and i OWN the center.  He has absolutely no chance! } 9. e3 Nbd7 10. b4 Re8 11. Nh3 f4 {ATTACK!!!! } 12. O-O fxg3 {Ripping down the defense a pawn at a time} 13. hxg3 e4 {Notice how all of my pieces are in postion to attack a very suspect defense.  Also, He has not developed his Queens knight and his King's Knight is hanging out in an alley! } 14. Ng5 Nh5 15. g4 Ng3 {Safe and logical} 16. Rf2 exf3 17. Nxf3 Ne4 {I decided to move to open up the queen and bishop's diagonal.....I mean, who am i to say they cant join in on the action?? } 18. Re2 Ndf6 {Now, all my pieces are ready.  queen and both bishops have open diagonals, rook is well placed (Although i really want him on the f- file) and both knights are waiting for a FORK} 19. Nc3 {Finally, he attacks! } Bxg4 20. d3 {Not sure what that move was supposed to accomplish} Ng3 21. Re1 Qd7 {Getting ready to attack his bishop! } 22. Qd2 Bh3 {OK, lets just look at the board here.  He has not ONE piece past 4 rank.  His pieces look like a bunch of hobo's trying to stay warm on a winter night (that's not me, that's Robert Frost).    Again, Im in attack mode trying to get rid of pieces now. } 23. Ng5 Bxg2 24. Kxg2 {Why did he position his queen there and then take with his King.  Bad move you will see after 24...Qg4!!} Qg4 25. Nf3 Nge4+ 26. Kh1 Nxd2 {Game over.  He never had a chance.} 27. Nxd2 {Re-take.  Understood.} Qg3 28. Re2 Rxe3 29. Rg1 Qh3+ {My plan here is obvious! } 30. Rh2 {Only move} Qxh2# {Blammo!  Have a nice day}
