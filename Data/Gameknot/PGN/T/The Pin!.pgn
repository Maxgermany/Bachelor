[Opening "Petrov (C42), French attack"]

1. e4 {e4 is my favorite Opening Move.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petrov's Defence. It offers attacking opportunities for both sides, and a few lines are quite sharp.} 3. Nxe5 {Classical Variation. Other Possible Moves are 3.Nc3 , 3.Bc4 , 3.d4 (Steinitz Variation)} Qe7 {Black should not continue to copy White's moves and try to restore the material balance immediately with 3...Nxe4? because after 4.Qe2 White will either win material (4...Nf6?? 5.Nc6+ wins Black's queen, and after 4...d5 5.d3 Qe7 6.dxe4 Qxe5 7.exd5 Black loses a pawn), or obtain a superior position (4...Qe7 5.Qxe4 d6 6.d4 f6 7.Nc3 dxe5 8.Nd5 Qd6 9.Bf4 Nd7 10.0-0-0 and White has a big advantage).  3... d6 is a better move.} 4. Nf3 {This is the main Line. other Lines are: 4.Nc4 , 4.Nd3 and 4.Nxf7 (Cochrane Gambit)  4...Kxf7 5.Nc3 c5!? 6.Bc4+ Be6 7.Bxe6+ Kxe6 8.d4 Kf7 9.dxc5 Nc6.} Nxe4 5. Be2 {natural development.  Other Possible Line is : 5.Qe2 d5 6.d3 Nf6 7.Bf4 [7.Qxe7 Bxe7 draw] Be6 = (and Black has a good position and opportunities).} g6 {5...d5 or 5...Nf6 are  better moves here. the knight at e4 is vulnerable.  } 6. O-O Bg7 7. Re1 {I place my rook in front of black's queen. } O-O {?? this move is wrong. black's knight is pin to the queen after white's bishop leaves the e file. 7...d5 was the right move.} 8. Bf1 d5 {it's late!} 9. d3 f5 10. dxe4 dxe4 {the pawn on e4 is pin to the queen.  now white can start his strong attack!} 11. Nc3 {just see this knight in the following moves! Also see the a1-h8 diagonal, the black king is open to white's attack. } Nc6 12. Nd5 Qf7 {? black place his queen in a bad diagonal!} 13. Bc4 {! another pin} Kh8 14. Nb6 Qf6 15. Nxa8 {this knight is a very strong piece!} exf3 16. Nxc7 {back to the battle! the Knight's Travel Path: b1-c3-d5-b6-a8-c7!!!} Ne5 17. Qd5 fxg2 {this pawn has no threat to the white's king. it acts like a defender!} 18. Bf4 {jsut see the board! all of the black pieces are around the black king. but ... } Nxc4 19. Qxc4 Qxb2 {the black queen escaped from the battle!  19...Qc6 was better. the black position is very bad, and he can not find a way to survive.} 20. Bd6 Rd8 21. Qf7 {! with the threat of Re8 and mate} Bd7 22. Ne8 {!! very strong move. } Bc6 {22...Qxa1 23.Rxa1 Rxe8 24.Qxd7 Rg8 25.Re1 h5 26.Re7 Kh7 27.Be5 Kh6 28.h4 a5 29.Rxg7 Rh8 30.Bf4+ g5 31.Bxg5 #} 23. Be5 {very beautiful position.}
