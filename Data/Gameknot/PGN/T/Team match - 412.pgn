1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {For a more detailed explanation up til here, check out the annotated game vs eludens} 6. Be3 {Main line.  6.Be3 followed by f3, g4, Qd2 and 0-0-0 in some order, } e5 7. Nb3 {black plays e5 to chase the white knight of the d4 square and gain position in the centre} Be6 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. O-O-O b5 10. f3 h5 {h5 is played to delay white from playing g4 as a follow up move after having played f3. Sicilian is all about delaying white to develop an attack on the kings side, whilst building up your own attack on whites queens side} 11. Kb1 Be7 {Decided to complete my development before playing Rc8. White doesn't immediately have an attacking move anyway. } 12. g3 Rc8 13. Bg2 {both g3 and Bg2 are a waste of time according to me. White wants to develop all his pieces and creates room to do so, however the bishop on g2 doesn't contribute to any immediate attacking strategy. } O-O {Black is now fully developed and has thereby gained upon whites early development. White has no real threat going on.} 14. Nd5 {White wants to create some space. Open up some lines to maybe evolve towards some kind of an attack. Black is ahead of him though. And with the c-line completely opened up, it's only a matter of a few moves before black starts to mount up the pressure on the castled king on the queens side } Nxd5 {With my pawn on h5 and therefore no white pawn on g4, I can easily play 14....-Nxd5. I can move my bishop to f5 after 15. exd5 without being chased. In case g4 is there, black is obliged to play Bxd5.} 15. exd5 Bf5 {attacking the pawn on c2. An attack black receives for free. } 16. Rdc1 {White needs to defend the pawn on c2. After 16 moves white is already thinking about defending rather than starting up an attack.} Nb6 {preparing Nc4. Black realizes that the knight will get captured off course, but that will bring the queen to b6 attacking the weak pawn construction on whites kings side. other advantages: connected rooks, loss of the bishops pair for white} 17. Bxb6 Qxb6 18. Rhd1 {I was expecting 18.f4, creating space for the bishop on g2. In stead white decides to add more pieces to his queens side, again giving me the impression he's defending and not attacking. Still f4 would not have stopped me from putting both my rooks on the c-line and moving my black bishop to a line attacking the castled king. Possible progress could have been: 18.f4-Rc7 19.fxe5-dxe5. The fact that you give away an open line for whites d pawn is not really a problem. The pawn is weak and white doesn't have the black squared bishop to provide back-up for promotion. Whereas black does have that back-up for his pawn on the e-line 20.Rf1 attacking the bishop and at least aiming some pieces at my kings side for me to worry about.} Rc7 19. Bf1 {White is almost obligated to play this move to further defend the c2 pawn by playing Bd3 with his next move.} Rfc8 20. Bd3 Bxd3 21. Qxd3 {21.cxd3 is not a good move, because whites pawn on d5 becomes unprotected and can be easily attacked by black by playing Qb7. You could say that at this point, at least material wise, the positions are evened out. However, white has no attack at all, and can only hope for black to screw up and reach an end game with as few pieces on the board as possible. Black on the other hand has almost every piece aimed at the castled king. Since the white queen moved from d2 to d3, the black queen has gained the possibility to infiltrate whites position on f2. I decided to work further on that and lure the queen even further away from f2.} Bg5 {Attacking the rook that cannot move from c1} 22. f4 {Only possible move sequence for white here is: 22.f4-exf4 23.Qf5-Bh6, and white regains the pawn on f4} exf4 23. Qf5 Bh6 24. gxf4 g6 {Whites pawn on f4 is weak, It cannot be defended easily and happens to be on the same color as blacks bishop.  I decided to defend my pawn on h5 and at the same time attack the queen. } 25. Qf6 {Best move for white. 25.Qe4 is followed by Rc4} Qf2 {Attacking 2 pawns at the same time, plus adding a piece to my attack on the castled king.} 26. Rdf1 {Accepting the pawn on d6 would not have been a good move. By removing the queen from its defense on b2, he brings himself in a dangerous situation:  26.Qxd6-Rxc2 27.Qxa6-Rxb2+ 28.Ka1-Rxc1 29.Rxc1-Bg7 or even worse: 27.Qxd6-Rxc2 28.Rxc2-Qxc2+ mate in 2} Qxh2 27. Nd4 {Mistake off course, because Bg7 wins the knight for black. Accepting the pawn on d6 leads to the same situation as explained in previous. } Bg7 {Even though white gave it away with this move, he would eventually have lost the pawn on f4, giving black 3 pawns with an open line to proceed to promotion.}
