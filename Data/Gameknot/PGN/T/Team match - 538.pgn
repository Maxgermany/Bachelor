1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {The Bishop opening. It is claimed to be not to good for white (as Black equals quickly) but nevertheless, we saw it twice in grandmasters games only last month...} Nf6 3. f3 {That is a bad move. It opens up the White king side in early times. much more suitable was 3. Nc3} c6 {wants d5 - strong center.} 4. Nh3 {a bad move too - second in a row. it allows black to play d5 and than to take on h3 with no defence for the white king.} d5 5. exd5 cxd5 6. Bb3 Be6 {Bxh3 was much, much better...} 7. d3 Bc5 {not letting white to castle.} 8. Bg5 Be7 {pitty, the Bishop is very strong on c5. it is better to play h6.} 9. Ba4+ Nc6 10. Na3 O-O 11. Bxc6 bxc6 12. c3 {in order to take the queen out eith the attempt of a long castle.} h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 {two Bishops vs. two Knights. almost always a great advantage. } 14. b4 Bh4+ 15. Kf1 {the king is standing poorly in the middleof the board - the end is probably near...} Qf6 16. Nc2 Bxh3 {the end is near} 17. gxh3 Rad8 18. Ne3 e4 19. dxe4 dxe4 20. Qa4 Qxf3+ 21. Kg1 Qf2# {}
