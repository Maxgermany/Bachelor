1. d4 {This game illustrates the explosive potential of the modern benoni.  At move 17 I used a temporary piece sacrifice in order to get a deadly attack on the dark squares. This game also highlights what happens when white strays from solid benoni principles and allows black to achieve his strategic goals without resistance. } Nf6 2. c4 {Usually when I see white play this I try to steer the game into the Modern Benoni.} e6 {Black can play c5 imedaitely but is better not to commit only two moves in. This move leaves white guess on blacks game plan. From here black can play into the siclian, king's indain defence, or QGD.} 3. Nc3 c5 {This is the start of the Modern Benoni. Black invites white to create a central wedge after d5. In return black can get some dangerous counter play on the queen side. The pawn structure that results is very dynamic.  Black aims for b5-b4 break and White aims for e4-e5.   The Modern Benoni was achieved in the 2008 WCh in mexico city. see this link for the game:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/25/result070925.xml} 4. d5 {4. dxc5 is possible but after 4. ...Bxc5 black has no trouble equalizing. The point of 4. D5 is that through it white achieves a central wedge that gives him an enduring space advantage. } exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {In exchange for strong counter play on the queenside black gets the backward D pawn. } 6. e4 {I have played players who limp out with 6. e3 and I have gone on to crush them. If you are going to play the benoni then you must be active. } g6 7. f4 {the four pawns attack: this is considered White's most aggressive plan against the Benoni.   White has tried Nf3; Bd3, Be2.   The immedaite Bf4 of Bg5 can give black something to think about. } Bg7 {This fianchetto bishop is the heart and soul of the Benoni. From here it eyes e5 and can later assist in the Queen side pawn expansion. } 8. Bb5+ {This is annoying check for black. } Nbd7 {In my experience(and I have a lot of tournament experience using the Benoni )this is blacks most solid reply to the check. Black can try  (8a). ...Bd7 implies a peice sacrifice after:  9.Bxd7 Nxd7 10. Nf3 is hard for black to stop e4-e5. or...  9. e5! dxe5 10. fxe5 Nh5 11. Nf3 0-0 12. Bxd7 Nxd7(12. ...Qxd7 13. 0-0 leaves white with a massive centre) 13. g4 Nxe5 14. gxh5 Nxf3  Qxf3, when it is hard to believe that black has enough compensation   If white plays 9. e5 then black has....  9... dxe5 10. fxe5 Nh5 11. e6 Qh4  with a good game.  (8b). ...Nfd7  9. a4 Qh4  (A tricky check which is designed to create a weakness in white's kingside. Once white plays g2-g3 black may be able to utilise the h3 square at a later juncture with Bh3 or simply place a peice on g4 with fear of being kicked away by h2-h3)  10. g3 Qe7  A less agressive approach for black is   8. ...Ndf7 9. A4 0-0 10. Nf3 Na6 11. 0-0 Nc7!(the advantage of Nc7 over Nb4 is that white does not have time to slide his bishop back to f1, but must instead decide where else it should go,or whether to allow it to be exchanged for the knight) 12. Bd3 a6 17 13. Qe1} 9. Bd3 {This transposes back to normal lines} a6 {prepares b5.   Also of note is the classical line in which Black plays 9. ...B5 immediately to deflect whites pieces from the defense of e4. } 10. Nf3 {normally it is not a good thing to allow black to play b5. A4 is considered best. } O-O {The immedaite B5 is too risky. I must follow a benoni cardinal rule: "Always keep a watchful eye on the e4-e5 break. } 11. O-O b5 {Black has achieved his major positional goal. Now it will be hard for white to prevent the queen side pawn march.} 12. a3 {a move that is forced. White can not allow b5-b4. This is signal that white has missed a step already. My hope is that white continues to play like this.  With my queenside up and rolling white will have a hard time finding the time to play e5. } Re8 {Re8 is a standard Benoni move that adds pressure to e5 and discourages white from playing e5. } 13. Re1 {This maintains the threat of e5 and hold the balance in the centre. } Rb8 {Preparing to play b4.} 14. Bd2 {defending against b5-b4.} c4 {This cramps whites position and opens up c5 for my knight. Also white has a serious weakness on the dark squares. The trade off for this move is that it opens up d4 for white. } 15. Bc2 a5 {Threatening b5. } 16. Nd4 {The idea of this move is Nc6. However, I have planned a tactical trap in the event of Nd4 when I played c4. } Nc5 {I am allowing Nc6} 17. Nc6 {Oh No! My Queen and Rook are forked. I wonder if billristol is thinking, "I got him now!"} Qb6 18. Nxb8 {The rook is a posioned apple. White should have taken steps to take care of his weakness on the dark sqaures with 18. Be3 after which the game would be equal. } Ng4 {Boom!!It is hard to see this coming without a complete understanding of the benoni. In exchange for the rook I get the follwoing.  1. A clear path for the dark bishop. 2. Domination of the dark squares(the reason why this is a good advantage is that his king is on dark sqaures.) 3. And two huge threats via Nxe4 and Bd4.  4. Active peice play. } 19. Be3 {Qf3 is also good.} Nxe3 {All is going according to plan it is rare that you get a opponent that does things your way. The next two moves for white are forced. When the dust settles black will be clearly be ahead. } 20. Rxe3 Nxe4 {The fall of e4 is the signal that the end for white is near. } 21. Nxe4 Qxe3+ 22. Nf2 {Hum was the rook worth it!} Bxb2 {It was a coin toss between Bd4 or this move. I decided to take the pawn because that would leave me with a clear advanced c pawn. Besides white is completely tied down on the back rank he has no useful moves. } 23. Rb1 Bd4 {White's next move is forced. } 24. Qf1 Bc5 25. Nc6 Qd2 {This move is the best for so many reasons!} 26. f5 {The last gasp of a dying man.} Qxc2 27. fxg6 fxg6 {I have no worries about openning F file for use by my rook.} 28. Nxa5 Bxf2+ 29. Kh1 Qxb1 {The quickest win.}
