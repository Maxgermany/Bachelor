1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {this is called Italian Game. } Bc5 {this is called Giuoco Piano. } 4. b4 {Now this is called Evans Gambit.white sacrifices a flank pawn for rapid development and a powerful center.} Bxb4 {white accepted the gambit.} 5. c3 {Evans Gambit Normal variation.} Ba5 6. d4 exd4 7. O-O dxc3 8. Qb3 {Evans gambit  Paulsen variation.although white is down with 3 pawns, he has a very strong game.} Qe7 9. Nxc3 Bxc3 10. Qxc3 Qf6 11. e5 {untill now this follows Gameknot database.} Qe7 {11....Qe7? i think better was 11....Qg6.} 12. Ba3 {logical and strong.} d6 13. exd6 cxd6 14. Rfe1 Ne5 {14....Ne5??? black should have played 14....Be6.} 15. Rxe5 {now if 15....dxe5 16.Bxe7.} Be6 16. Rae1 Nh6 {16....Nh6?? black has a very dangerous position and should move his queen (may be to d8, not f6 because of 17.Bxd6 that will lead to easy game for white).} 17. Re5xe6 {17.Rxe6!!! here black resigned because his queen will be eaten and white will be ,at least, up with 5 pawns and has a very strong position.let's see how would black continue.} fxe6 18. Rxe6 Qxe6 19. Bxe6 {now there is no hope for black. White's pair of bishops and queen can't be stopped.}
