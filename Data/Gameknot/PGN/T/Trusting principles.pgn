[Opening "Gruenfeld (D85), modern exchange variation"]

1. d4 {This was a return game, I had played against the same opponent with Black and drew in a complicated Najdorf. So I was determined to win this one, especially since I had White.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {The main reason why I played 1. d4 was because I saw that my opponent employs the Gruenfeld as his main defensive weapon to closed games.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Nf3 c5 8. Rb1 {This was very much en-vogue a few years back, but it's hardly played now. I guess all the top GMs analysed to death the resulting variations.} O-O 9. Be2 cxd4 10. cxd4 Qa5+ {The sharpest answer. Black snatches a pawn at the cost of a few tempos. The alternative is playing 9...Nc6, but that leads to a difficult middlegame for Black. I had the opportunity to play that line against ksasidhar and annotate my relatively fast win with the White pieces.} 11. Bd2 {11. Qd2 is the alternative but Black doesn't have much to worry about in the resulting endgames, mainly because of his Q-side majority.} Qxa2 12. O-O Bg4 {The only other reasonable alternative is 12...Nd7, which concedes a lot of space to White at the cost of keeping the extra pawn.} 13. Bg5 {13. Be3 is a good alternative.} h6 14. Be3 {For a while 14. Bh4 was played but I don't think very much of that move.} e6 {This is a strange move. I can only find one game in my database but White didn't chose the most critical follow-up. The move itself has some points, it prevents d5 and prepares to develop the Nb8 to c6 but it has bigger things going against it. On one hand, it's slow, another pawn move when I am fully mobilized and Black still has pieces on the back rank and on the other hand, should I play d5, a passed pawn will appear on the board much faster than before.} 15. Qd3 {A very flexible move, connecting the Rooks and preparing d5. The immediate caputre 15. Rxb7 doesn't lead to anything but equality after 15...Nc6 16. h3 Bxf3 17. Bxf3 Rfd8 18. d5 Ne5 19. Qe2 Qxe2 20. Bxe2 exd5 21. exd5 Rxd5 22. Rxa7 Rax7 23. Bxa7 and despite the Bishop pair, I have nothing.} Qa4 {Retreating the Queen to a safer spot.} 16. Rxb7 {Winning back the pawn sacrificed on move eleven. Besides recovering the material, the Rook is menacing on the 7th rank and the pawn centre is still flexible. I'd say White has a pretty big edge in this position.} Nc6 {Developing the last minor piece and putting pressure on d4.} 17. d5 {Very typical move in this line, White gets a passed d-pawn from the middlegame.} Bxf3 {This exchange is necessary in order to have a good place to retreat the Knight.} 18. gxf3 {I took with the pawn mainly because I saw that I could double Rooks on the seventh rank and I didn't want to suffer from back rank tactics.} Rfd8 {A standard tactic, delaying the pawn exchange and activating the Rook. The downside is that f7 is weakened.} 19. Rc1 {The crucial tempo needed to invade the 7th rank with the other Rook.} exd5 {It's slightly better to exchange a pair of pawns because Black might get some counterplay against my weak K-side.} 20. exd5 Nd4 {The Knight was attacked and it had to go somewhere. Perhaps better was 20...Na5, removing one Rook from the seventh rank, but the Knight might become stuck on the rim and trying to exchange a pair of Rooks after 20...Na5 21. Rb5 Rdc8 22. Rxc8+ Rxc8 23. d6 Nc8 24. Qd5 and f7 and a7 are horribly weak.} 21. Rcc7 {Doubling Rooks on the seventh rank so early in the game is a major success and a sign that Black is technically lost.} Qa1+ 22. Kg2 {My King is safer than Black's even with the busted pawn structure.} Rdf8 {A necessity. Black doesn't want to exchange the Knight just yet, if he can secure f7, perhaps it could come to f4 with some nasty tricks in mind.} 23. d6 {No use putting it off. } Ne6 {Covering the a2-g8 diagonal and eyeing the f4 square.} 24. Rc4 {Covering the fourth rank.} a5 {Black's only source of counterplay, his passed a-pawn supported by his Rook and Bishop can be quite dangerous in some lines but here it will be securely blockaded.} 25. Bd1 {An interesting plan had come to mind that compliments the last move. The Bishop would be perfectly suited on a4, defending a future pawn on d7 and blockading Black's at the same time.} Qf6 {Regrouping the Queen with the obvious intent to go after my King.} 26. d7 {The Queening square is securely defended but the pieces doing the defending are also tied down. One of the reasons why it's always better to attack than to defend in chess. One extra move can make the all the difference.} Rfd8 {Not the best piece to blockade a passed pawn, but when it's on the seventh rank, anything will do.} 27. Ba4 {Now things have stabilized on the Q-side and in the centre. } Kh7 {A useful move in some lines, avoiding the pin on the last rank.} 28. f4 {Directed against Black's last move and showing that there is no safe place on the board for the Black King.} Ra6 {After making this move, my opponent resigned, much to my surprise. I admit his position isn't enviable and from an objective perspective it might be lost but why give up so early? }
