1. d4 {Hi all! Queen's pawns games are often considered to be less tactically sharp than games that begin with 1. e4. But this game certainly shows tactics can come in very quickly in some variations! This was a hard-fought game where white sacrifices material early to try to keep the initiative and not allow black to consolidate his material edge. It's a tense battle, with Black succeeding over time to force some of white's aggressive pieces off the board. So how did it turn out? Well, read on and don't forget to comment and rate.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Qc2 {The third most popular choice. Much more popular are Nc3, followed by e3. Qc2 breaks the rule of moving the queen too early, but since it often ends up on c2 in QPG, it's somewhat justified.} dxc4 {Making the queen move again...} 5. Qxc4 Bg4 {Putting pressure on d4 by attacking its defender.} 6. Nc3 Nbd7 7. e4 {Establishing a big center, but can it be maintained?} e5 {Black hits right away, and wild complications are in store.} 8. dxe5 {So white knocks off black's central presence with his d-pawn.} Bxf3 {And Black takes the knight, because 9. gxf3 Ne5 doesn't look all that great for white.} 9. e6 {So white invites more complications - that pawn on f7 looks yummy!} Ne5 {Black hits the queen...} 10. exf7+ {White deprives black of castling rights and makes the king march forward, cutting off lines for his DSB and queen.} Ke7 11. Qb4+ {According to one opening database, Qc5+ and Qb3+ had both been tried, but neither one seemed sufficient to me. Qc5+ runs into 11...Ke6 to protect the knight, and the queen is under fire from the bishop. So my idea is to get the queen away from attack on either c4 or c5, and to get her onto b3, but with check.} Ke6 {Probably a mistake. The downside of 11.Qb4, was that it allows Kxf7, but after 12. Qb3+ Kg6, the position is still a little unclear.} 12. Qb3+ Kd6 13. Bf4 {Pinning the knight, which is black's extra piece, to the king, and making the king keep guard. This was blacks best piece, so it must be pinned. If the 13. gxf3 to get the piece back, ...Nxf3 is painful for white, as white is vulnerable to forks... For instance... 14. Kd1 Ke5+ 15. Kc2?? Nd4+, winning the queen.} Bh5 {With the knight pinned, the bishop now needs to save itself, keeping guard of d1 preventing either Rd1+ or O-O-O} 14. f3 {Renewing the Rd1+ threat, pushing the King away from the Ne5.} Qe7 {So black protects the knight with the queen.} 15. Nb5+ {!? Ripping the c-file open to further expose the black king. Throwing away a second piece, may not be entirely sound, but this one will be recovered in a few moves.} cxb5 {Black has little choice, since the Knight cut off the c7 square.} 16. Qxb5 {Controlling squares around the king, attacking the Ne5, xraying the Bh5, establishing control of c4 for the bishop, a nice centralized square...} Bxf7 {Getting the pawn back, but more importantly, challenging the c4 square and the whole light square diagonal.} 17. Rd1+ {Driving the king away. Note that 17...Nd5 18. Rxd5+ Bxd5 19. Qxd5+ Kc7 20. Bxe5+ is not at all good for black, as the white bishops and queen are deadly against the exposed black king.} Kc7 18. Bxe5+ {Picking up the sacrificed piece, but still down a knight, with two pawns to show for it. But the initiative is the main fight here.} Kc8 19. Qd3 {Probably not the best move. The point is to put pressure on d7 and d8, so the Be5 is immune to the queen. I totally missed black's terrific response.} Nd7 {! Attacking the Be5, putting white on the back foot for a minute and also shielding d8 for the king.} 20. Rc1+ {I saw little better...} Kd8 21. Rc7 {When in doubt, but a rook on the 7th - knight is double pinned now - to the king and queen! Be5 is still immune.} Ke8 {Unpinning the knight, and renewing the threat on Be5.} 22. Qb5 {Reinstating the pin on the knight and threatening to infiltrate via b7. But doesn't this allow...??} Qb4+ {Yes, black will get the queens off, and one would think the attack would be over, but white wants the exchange on his terms...} 23. Bc3 {! Putting the question to the queen.} Qxb5 24. Bxb5 {And the LSB replaces the queen and keeps the pin.} Rd8 {? I think Be6 is a little more flexible, although black does still have issues, most notably ideas like Kf2, Rd1, f4, f5 and or e5, e6 in some variations. The rook is now threatened by the DSB.} 25. Rxb7 {! I'll allow myself an exclamation mark for this move, as removing the b-pawn opens the a5-d8 diagonal while clearing the rook at the same time.} Bc5 {Black moves to interrupt with Bb6.} 26. b4 {Did not like Bxg7 here as Black's rook gets active after Rg8. This forces the Black bishop to move again to a worse diagonal. It needs to stay on the a3-f7 diagonal to prevent against Bxg7 followed by Bf6, eliminating black's rook from protecting the knight (Black needs to have Be7 as a resource if ever white plays Bxg7). So Black must leave the a7-g2 diagonal, which will allow Kf2, activating the rook while keeping guard of g2 in case the g-file opens for black.} Be7 27. Rxa7 {Creating two outside passed pawns, and protecting the a2 pawn from the black sniper. 27. Kf2 a6 brings black some reprieve. Now, the pin is still in tact.} Bf6 {Black continues to exchange the attacking pieces.} 28. Bxf6 {White accepts, since white's bishop did not have a promising future anywhere else.} gxf6 29. Kf2 {Now installing the Rd1 threat.} Rg8 {Getting the rook active} 30. Rd1 {Knight needs another defender...} Be6 {Only move.} 31. f4 {Time to displace the bishop with the pawns!} Rg7 {I thought f5 would have been better, since there's a neat little trick in the following line: 31...f5 32. exf5 Bxf5 33. Rd5! Rxg2+!? 34. Kxg2? Be4+! 35. Kg3 Bxd5 and black is still worse, but has some hope to draw the endgame. However instead of 34. Kxg2?, Kf3! keeps white's strong advantage.} 32. f5 {Driving back the bishop.} Bg8 {Only move, so as not to interfere with the rook. Notice white's control of all the squares on the a2-e6 diagonal.} 33. Bc6 {White voluntarily gives up control of c4, because what can black's bishop do there? All black's pieces are tied down to the knight, and the king can't move out of the pin without dropping the knight, so white is free do to do what he wants. Black is not quite in zugzwang, but can't make any moves that improve his position.} Re7 34. b5 {Simple - promote the pawn and win.} Bf7 35. b6 {With Rc7 and b7 to follow...} Kf8 {35...Bh5 wouldn't help any after Rd2 - again the bishop has no useful squares. But now there aren't enough defenders of the pinned knight.} 36. Rdxd7 {And black resigns, as soon the b-pawn will promote. Thanks to my opponent who defended well, and made me search for the right continuations. A crazy game, showing the importance of active pieces and also pins. Hope you enjoyed. Please comment and rate, and let me know what you liked and didn't like.}
