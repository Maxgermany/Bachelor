1. e4 {dsb12's intro And so, to the first attempt by the Caissa team to play an annotated training game. We've decided to play an unrated game, 5 days a move, with dsb13 as White because josetborda2 would like to practice his Black repertoire. We can (and will try) to annotate as we go along, saving the annotations so that people can read them. It'll be just like Mastergame (which anybody who isn't (a) 40+ and (b) British might not understand as a joke). I'll explain later. If anyone else wants to jump in with annotations, please feel free to do so, but can you wait until we're 5 moves down the line so as not to spoil our game? Cheers, David  dsb13's comments to white first move. Right then. 1. e4. A classic opening, grabbing a share of the centre and opening lines for the Bf1 and Qd1.   } e5 {dsb13's comments to 1.e5} 2. Nc3 {dsb13's comments to 2nc3.  White plays the Vienna Game. The plan is to play f4 in the manner of the King's Gambit, without letting Black play exf4 and d5, equalising. White is trying to develop and maintain some tension in the position with this move. He can, if he wants, look to play g3, Bg2 and Nge2 as a system of development, or even look to play d4. I've been playing this for some time and prefer it to 2. Nf3 which is probably, objectively, the strongest move in this position. It takes Black out of his book a little, and avoids the Petroff (2. Nf3 Nf6), Philidor (2. Nf3 d6) and Latvian (2. Nf3 f5).  Black starts to get dizzy} Ne7 {josetborda: No immediate threat to my e5.  let's see if I can hold the center and force white into advancing and lock itself into the h wing.    dsb13: 2. ... Ne7 seems illogical in that it blocks the Be7 and doesn't put pressure on the e4 pawn, but Black can play Ng6 (Xf4) and still threaten ... d5. } 3. Bc4 {dsb13: The choice is probably 3.d4, 3.f4 or 3.Bc4. I quite fancy 3.f4 but I think that Black can play 3. ... d5 or even 3. ... Nbc6 with a view to Ne7-g6-e5 at some point. I'd play 3.Bc4 against 2. ... Nf6 in any event.  josetborda: that illed a potential o-o on that side} f6 {dsb13: Interesting, although it can't possibly be good. It's not that f6 belongs to the knight (which is going to g6), but it's going to make 0-0 impossible without kicking the Bc4 off the a2-g8 diagonal and it weakens the h5-e8 diagonal too. White has 3 genuine options here - 4.f4, 4.Nf3 and 4.d4. 4.f4 is interesting. The threat is not just fxe5, but also to push for g2-g4-g5 as part of the attack. In those circumstances, White will play d3 and either Nge3-g3 or Nf3.} 4. f4 Nbc6 5. Nf3 a6 {josetborda: now I start preparing to do O-O on the a wing.} 6. a4 {dsb13: Black's difficulty here is getting his bishops developed and king to safety. 0-0 is going to be difficult since ... f6 and ... a6 is going to leave the queenside subject to a b2-b4-b5 assault. Can Black leave his king in the centre? dsb13: The question is as to whether to prevent ...b5. 6.d4, opening the last of the lines, is attractive because exd4 or exf4 leaves the f6 pawn looking uncomfortable. It'll come in time but let's stop ...b5  } b6 {josetborda: gotta stick to plan.  will try o-o on the a wing by means of 6-b6. white did not go for confrontation on h wing.  the balance in the center now is unclear, but here is where I lose, or not. white bishop may now feel threatened. I hope-calculate white will either go into preparation for 0-0, or f5  Josetborda: but may go for g3?  anything else I can see would mean too much of a loss for white.  } 7. O-O Bb7 8. fxe5 fxe5 9.
