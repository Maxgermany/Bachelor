1. f4 {White opens with....} d5 {I play Queen Pawn} 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Playing with the database at the moment.} 3. d4 Bf5 {I like to put a bishop here as it stakes a strong claim to e4. Also potential future attacks on c2} 4. Nc3 e6 {Defend black bishop and open my black bishops path.} 5. e3 Nc6 {Continue to develop. Don;t know why white played e3 other than to release white bishop. Despite upcoming pin I don't like that structure.} 6. Bb5 a6 {I attempt to drive bishop away. However I am anticipating he take the knight. I intend to castle otherside, and I expect him to as well, so I am not to bothered.} 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 8. O-O Bd6 {I develop my bishop after his castling} 9. Ne5 {he moves knight up threatening c6.} Bxe5 {I exchange} 10. fxe5 {He busts up his pawns but threatens my knight.} Ng4 {I move knight up with an eye to developing my queen on to the H file.} 11. h3 {Attempting to drive it back} Nh6 {Driven back, but I still expect to develop my Queen on to H4.  He is black square weak now, which means looking back the exchange may not have been the best idea.} 12. e4 {I think white wants to attack my knight here} dxe4 {I take} 13. Bxh6 {He does, after I take pawn, however I see it as just opening up G file to my rook to exert pressure on his king} gxh6 {I take and open up G} 14. Ne2 Qg5 {I develop Queen, I now move to G file to have the rook support.} 15. g4 {White pushes back bishop} Bg6 {bishop moves back.} 16. Nf4 {Knighr attacks.} f5 {I moved here knowing he couldnt take it. I intended to then move my doubled h file pawn up.} 17. exf6 e.p. {I forget about passe pawn thing. grumble} h5 {I proceed with H pawn, intending to sacrifice my bishop or just take with pawn} 18. Nxe6 {Didnt see that, However I intend to push forward with mate attack.} Qe3+ {Meant to check and be a permanent threat.} 19. Kg2 Rg8 {I bring the rook out.} 20. Nxc7+ {Grumble, i was being to single minded. however that rook is a dead piece so i dont mind losing it, especially when I see to close. White choosing to do that however indicated to me he either didnt recognise the threat or was not to bothered with the game!} Kf7 21. g5 {Stopping me opening up the file.} h4 {Rather than take I intend to move my queen to g3} 22. d5 {pawn up!?} Qg3+ {attack!} 23. Kh1 Qxh3+ {clearing the area to have more freedom.} 24. Kg1 e3 {i did this move to open up my bishop. I checked before hand he couldnt put me in check (and take my tempo)} 25. dxc6 {!?} Qg3+ 26. Kh1 Be4+ {White resigns. I am pretty sure white gave up in the last moves. I enjoyed the middle part of the game though. Annotations welcome:)}
