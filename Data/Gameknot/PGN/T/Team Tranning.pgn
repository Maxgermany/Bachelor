1. e4 {A good start - but make sure you have a plan. You must have a tried/trusted response to e5, c5, nf6, etc.} e5 2. Bc4 {N before B is usual, and is based on sound judgement} Bc5 {classic bishops} 3. d3 {nothing especially wrong here, but ... I want you to follow tried and trusted lines, so look in the gameknot openings db, nobody plays this !!! I prefer to bring out pieces first. Minimise pawn moves unless they are necessary, tried and tested, supported, and part of a clear plan. Just give this thought.} Nf6 {Now I have two pieces to your one, developed} 4. Nf3 Nc6 {I just continue to develop } 5. Be3 {Now a choice for me. You want BxB to give open f file and simplified position. Your doubled e pawns would not be exploitable so I prefer to swap on my terms, or hold the tension. } Bb6 6. Nc3 {Your position is ok here} O-O {Now you need to continue developing and improving the position} 7. Nd5 {You need to think this through first. Your position was ok. 0-0 is natural. Where will you be after swaps and what will your pawn structure be like ? Will your position be improved !!} Nxd5 8. exd5 {Bxp might be better. You need to think through exactly where this position will leave you, especially how your pawn structure will be. } Na5 9. Bxb6 axb6 10. Nxe5 {Looks like a blunder. If only you were castled !!} Qe7 11. Qe2 {When you make a mistake think extra hard. Make sure you minimise your loss or get maximum positional return or even find a recovering line. Qe2 is nearly forced} Re8 12. d4 {again you have little choice} Nxc4 13. Qxc4 d6 14. O-O dxe5 15. dxe5 Qxe5 16. Rfe1 {You need to think through the next few moves. Obviously I'll play 16 .....QxR 17 RxQ  RxR 18 Qf1 RxQ  19 KxR  leaving me a R and a B for a pawn, and an easily won game. This sequence of moves is almost forced, so is difficult to miss. } Qxe1+ {This game is pretty much over now. To summarise then. Do not move pawns unless - it is part of a proven tried opening system, or absolutely necessary, or the pawn is fully supported and it makes sense, or you have a clear plan and possibility to achieve promotion. Move 3, and 8 broke those ideas. Cut out blunders. Write down your moves, check the position on a real board, check the possible repies to your move. Watch out all the time for pins, forks, discovered checks, etc. and especially combinations which threaten your back rank. You may be playing too many games and/or playing too fast. Use the allowed time. Take a minimum of 5 minutes concentration on every move. Write down ideas, positions, sequences, thoughts about what you are trying to achieve. Always have a plan !  } 17. Qf1 {I've won a R now anyway, so I'll finish this sequence R and B for a p ahead. I'm not sure you will learn anything else from this game.} Qxf1+ 18. Kxf1 {From here, first I'll get my pieces active, then look to exploit your weaknesses . (If I couldn't find anything obvious I'd try to swap Rs, so my advantage would be proportionately bigger, and pick off your pawns.) Your weaknesses are first 2 pieces down, second your d pawn (advanced), third your back rank is vulnerable, fourth you control fewer squares.} Bf5 19. c3 {The problem with that move is that it weakens your white squares and makes my B stronger, and exposes your bank rank. Don't get too down - this position is hopeless and you cannot defend your pawns adequately and avoid mate at the same time.} Bd3+ 20. Kg1 Rxa2 {I'm not sure there is anything to learn here. Your back rank is vulnerable so I'm aiming to double my Rs and threaten mate by getting Rs on g2 and h2. You need a spare move to find escape squares} 21. Rc1 Rxb2 22. h3 Ree2 23. Rf1 Red2 {Now mate looms } 24. Re1 Kf8 25. g4 Rdxf2 26. g5 {Now its mate in three} Rfg2+ 27. Kh1 Rgh2+ {}
