1. e3 {Van't Krujis opening.} e5 {Amsterdam attack.} 2. d4 Nc6 3. a3 {Not in the database.  White seems to do ok with Nf3, but too few games have been played to really determine that.  Most variations from this position favor black.} exd4 4. exd4 d5 5. h3 b6 6. Nf3 Nf6 7. Bb5 Bd7 8. O-O Bd6 9. Qe1+ {Checking with the rook would probably have been better.  But I see nothing obviously wrong here.} Ne4 10. Ne5 {Black gets a knight and pawn for a knight or bishop.  Not a great trade.  White also loses control over the center.} Bxe5 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Qe2 c6 13. Bd3 Qe7 {White wins back the pawn.  Bf5 might have been better.} 14. Bxe4 dxe4 15. Qxe4 O-O 16. Nc3 {I like Bf4 here.  It puts pressure on the black knight.  Black might defend with f6, but that opens up the king's castle.} f5 {Black opens it anyway.} 17. Nd5 {Uh, no.  Qf4 possibly, Qb4 shows promise.  Qe3 or Qe2, even.  Here PxN, QxP+ trades a knight for a pawn.  White can't take Ra8 because it is protected by black's other rook.} cxd5 18. Qxd5+ Kh8 19. Bf4 {There's that bishop move.  But now I'm thinking maybe Bd2.  If black's queen and rook remain lined up, Bb4 would be such a lovely pin.  } Nc6 20. Rae1 {I still prefer Rfe1, because now Rf has nowhere to move.  But scratch that--Bd6!  OMG!  Black loses a rook for a bishop!  This is FAR better than just chasing black skirt.} Qh4 {That bishop (QxBd7) isn't free, since it would be followed by QxBf4.} 21. Qc4 {Scary.  Because Pg5 guts white's bishop.} g5 {Hate to say I told you so.  Pg3 is a tepid response, considering Qxh3.} 22. Qc3+ {Ah, MUCH better.  Now the bishop can withdraw to safety.} Kg8 23. Bg3 Qh6 {Has white any tricks to prevent f4 capture of the bishop?} 24. Bd6 {Yes.  Feed the bishop to the black queen instead.  This is not a wise plan, though it must have frightened black into moving the rook instead of QxBd6.} Rf6 25. Be7 Nxe7 26. Rxe7 Bb5 27. Qb3+ Kf8 28. Qb4 {Lovely.  If the king does not move, white can take the black queen (and a pawn) with Rxh7+ (discovered check).} Re8 {...and the black queen gets traded for a rook.} 29. Rd7+ {Ok, what?  She was just there for the taking.  With discovered check you can have whatever HVP (high value piece) you can trade.  Why settle for NOTHING?} Kg8 {Well, at least QxBb5 helps even the score.} 30. Qxb5 Rf7 {Now that white is ahead every trade is to his advantage.} 31. Qc4 Qe6 32. Rd5 g4 33. hxg4 fxg4 34. Rg5+ Kf8 35. Qc3 h6 36. Qh8+ Ke7 37. Rg8 Rxg8 38. Qxg8 Qe5 {QxPg4 doesn't prevent QxPb2, which splits the white pawns and makes them more vulnerable.} 39. Qxg4 h5 {Here Qb4+ is advised.  This in addition protects e1, so if black keeps the king on the e file Re1 pins the black queen.} 40. Qb4+ {:)} Kd7 {As the king ventures out where the white rook can check, the black rook becomes vulnerable.} 41. Rd1+ Kc6 42. Qc4+ Kb7 {Oh, exceedingly well done.  QxRf7+ is a freebie.} 43. Qxf7+ Ka6 44. Qc4+ b5 45. Qc6+ Ka5 46. b4+ Ka4 47. Qa6# {Oops, I just realized black is MY guy.  I need to rewrite all this.}
