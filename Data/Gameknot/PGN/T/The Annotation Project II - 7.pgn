1. f4 {This was one of my four opening games in this tournament, all of which were as black. I was pleased with the outcome, (though probably a bit lucky), gaining my first half point. Annotation starts at move 9.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 {All as standard for this opening.} e6 {At this point in the tournament, knowing nothing about this opening, (though having read the annotations from the first annotation project), I felt rather out of my depth. It seems to me though that if I can restrict whites development, and swap a few minor pieces off, I may have a chance. Trouble is, all my pieces are too restricted at the moment, so 9...e4 to provide more options for the queen and bishop. (Now it seems accepted that ...Bg7 is the best move.)} 10. O-O Bc5+ {Getting the bishop out with tempo surely can't be bad? He can't effectively block the check so must waste a move with the king.} 11. Kh1 Qe7 {Clearing space on the back row. I can't protect either of the e-pawns so there's no point in trying.} 12. Nxe4 {One of them had to fall soon!} Nd7 {Develop while I can. Maybe Na6 was better, as Nd7 restricts the king. Trouble is, a3 or c3 would make the knight look a bit silly.} 13. Bf3 Kb6 {Moving to avoid the discovered check. Maybe not necessary yet as the e4 knight can't move anywhere too frightening, but I'm going to have to move the king anyway in order to escape via c7 or a7.} 14. Nbc3 {Obviously white needs to bring more material into the attack, and quickly! } a6 {I'm not too worried about Na4+ as the bishop is adequately covered, and simple exchanges suit me fine! I do need to get my king away though, and preferably all the way to b8. (He eventually makes it on move 30, by which time the castle has fallen anyway!} 15. Na4+ Ka7 {Na4 was expected, so I continue as planned.} 16. b4 Bd6 {I think maybe b6 was better for the bishop. My queen is now more restricted, and I should be guarding against a possible Be3 later.} 17. d4 Nb6 {Hoping to chase the knight away, or swap it off.} 18. Nxd6 Qxd6 {He goes for the bishop instead. OK by me, hopefully my rooks can get involved more easily now.} 19. Nc5 Rab8 {Defending the b7 pawn.} 20. Rb1 Nd5 21. c4 Nb6 {That was a wasted move. These pawns could cause me a problem...} 22. Nxb7 {This exchange I'm happy with, I'd like to make sure I keep the other rook for the endgame though. Trouble is, I failed to notice the imminent loss of my knight.} Rxb7 23. Bxb7 Kxb7 24. c5 {And the knight falls, though I do get 2 of those irritating pawns for it.} Qxd4 {I failed to spot Bb2 here. Luckily so did he! Had he played it, I'd have had to play ...Qxb4, then if Bxh8 ...Qxc5 leaving me in a slightly worse position than the actual game, but with one less pawn to deal with.} 25. cxb6 Qxb6 {Had to take with the queen to avoid that skewer.} 26. Bb2 Rd8 {Grab the open file. If he contests it, I'll swap rooks, grab the e-pawn, and then aim to keep my pawns to the white squares.} 27. Be5 Rd5 28. Rbc1 Kc8 {To me, a draw is looking likely, and I was thinking of swapping the rook and bishop for the pawn and queen,} 29. Bxc7 {still on the cards, but he would have the extra pawn, and his pawn structure is better. Besides, I tend to mess up rook+multiple pawn endings :)} Qb7 {And then I saw a potential threat involving a double attack on his g pawn.} 30. Bb6+ Kb8 {...d7 allows the swap again, which I was still half considering.} 31. Bc7+ Ka7 {...Ka8 wmay be better as the bishop can't reach it but I wanted to keep to the a pawn.} 32. Ba5 Rd7 {Had my king gone to a8 it wouldn't have been necessary to defend against Rc7. I'm feeling rather restricted now, but still can't see how white can convert this to a win.} 33. Rc2 {Presumably in order to double on the c-file} Qe4 {giving me a much needed move. If Rfc1? ...Qxc2. C1 doesn't defend due to Rd1#. I know it won't happen, but it gives me a much needed move for the queen.} 34. Rcf2 Rf7 {suddenly the action swings towards the other side, and more importantly, away from my king!} 35. Kg1 e5 {I'm happy to swap my isolated pawn for his f-pawn, along with a rook exchange.} 36. fxe5 Qd4 {Swapping rooks immediately was an option, but I wanted his pawn to advance so when I took it my queen would be defending against ...Rf7+.} 37. e6 {and he obliges.} Rxf2 38. Rxf2 Qe3 39. e7 Qxe7 40. g3 {So material is even, but I have no potential targets to attack. White can win by swapping either piece for my queen. White's bishop is going nowhere at the moment, and his rook can't attack on its own. If I'm to get a draw, it'll likely have to be by perpetual check although if white is to win, he'll probably have to promote a pawn to do it, therefore, if I can prevent white promoting, I get the draw.} Kb7 {Bring the king towards the action whilst waiting to see what white has in mind.} 41. Kf1 Kc6 42. Rc2+ Kb5 {Now I can prevent whites pawns moving any further. If white plays 43. c5+ I'll have to play ...Ka4 as ...Qxc5; 44. bxc5 ...Kxa5 loses due to 45. a4! (meaning my own pawn prevents my king reaching his passer on c5.} 43. Rc7 Qf6+ 44. Kg2 h5 45. Rb7+ Ka4 46. Rb6 Qb2+ 47. Kh3 Qe2 48. Rxg6 Qf1+ 49. Kh4 Qc4+ 50. Kxh5 {Encouraging him to put distance between his king and pawns.} Qxa2 51. h4 {Now, can the queen deliver perpetual check? I think so, because white can't block with the g-pawn, if the rook blocks the rank then I attack on the diagonal (as I'm already on a white square), and if he goes to g5, the rook can't block anyway. If I can persuade him behind the pawns then even better! Let's see what happens...} Qd5+ 52. Kh6 Qd2+ {whichever way the king or rook go, I have a check. } 53. Kh7 Qd7+ 54. Kh6 Qd2+ 55. Kh5 Qd5+ 56. Kh6 {And there it is. Now, with hindsight, I feel a bit lucky to escape with a draw. If whites king had stayed closer to the pawns, then the pawns could have been used to block checks whilst advancing. A lone queen will beat a king and 2 pawns that far away from promoting, but with the rook as well? Can the queen force the king far enough away from the pawns with a rook interfering. That's why I sacced my pawns instead - to encourage him to do it for me! Should I have concentrated more on protecting my own pawns? Thoughts welcomed :)}
