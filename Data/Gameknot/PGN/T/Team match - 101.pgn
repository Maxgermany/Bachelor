[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian defense.} 2. e5 h5 {Whoa!  Black does well with c5, Bf5, even d4 or e6.  But moving the rook pawns so early in the game is generally considered wasteful.  I remember a strategy published in a chess magazine years ago called "crustacean," opening with rook pawns.  It doesn't help establish control over the center of the board very well, though.} 3. Nf3 b6 4. d4 Bg4 5. Be2 e6 6. Bg5 f6 7. exf6 gxf6 8. Bh4 Bb4+ 9. c3 Qd6 {Yikes!  This trades the black bishop for a pawn.  Black might think white's a rook is vulnerable, but white can intercede QxPc3 with Qd2, protecting Pb2.} 10. cxb4 Qxb4+ 11. Qd2 {Exactly like that.} Qxd2+ 12. Kxd2 {Although the queens are now off the board which makes castling pointless, NbxQd2 would have cleared white's back row, and preserved the castling option--useful for putting rooks on center files.} c5 13. b3 a5 14. h3 Bf5 15. g4 {This trade doesn't work out so well for white in terms of material--two pawns for one.} hxg4 16. hxg4 Bxg4 17. Nc3 Nd7 18. Nh2 {Free bishop?  Here black should play BxBe2.  19. KxBe2 (or NxBe2), RxBh4.  Black makes up the lost bishop, gaining two points (from white's forsaken pawns).  If white plays BxPf6 instead, RxRh1.  White just about has to play R(a1)xRh1, leaving black N (either one) takes Bf6.} Bh3 {Right piece, wrong square.} 19. Bg4 Bg2 20. Rhg1 {RxBh4, white comes back with RxBg2.  Black might then respond with Pf5, though white would answer with Bh5+.  If black takes it with the rook at h4, white could play Rg8+, threatening the a rook, but then black would intercede with Nf8.  If white moves the bishop elsewhere, black can play RxPd4+, giving black opportunity to castle or otherwise protect the knight at g8.} Be4 {White might trade knight for bishop, doubling up black's pawns.} 21. Bxe6 {...or just pick off that free pawn.} Ne7 {Another way to protect the knight would be to castle queen's side.  But RxBh4 is still there.} 22. Nb5 {White is setting up for the classic king/rook fork.  Black can probably best protect c7 with Kd8.} Rxh4 {That bishop isn't worth the rook white now loses with Nc7+.} 23. Nc7+ Kf8 {I think Kd8 would have been better, as it would protect Nd7.} 24. Nxa8 Rxh2 25. Bxd7 Rxf2+ 26. Ke1 Rc2 27. Nxb6 cxd4 28. Bg4 Rc3 29. Na4 Re3+ 30. Kd2 f5 31. Be2 d3 {That pawn was the black rook's sole support.} 32. Rae1 {Wait, KxRe3.  White really blundered.} dxe2 {Black blunders.  The rook and pawn are not worth that bishop.} 33. Rxe2 {???  KxRe3!  It is a free rook.  That pawn wasn't going anywhere--there were two rooks on it and no way the bishop could be brought to bear.} Rd3+ 34. Ke1 f4 35. Nc5 f3 {White is advised to trade rooks (NxRd3, PxRe2, KxPe2).  White picks up another pawn this way.} 36. Rf2 Rd4 {Actually, I like Rc2 better.  Although white might play NxBe4, Rc1+ gives black Rg1.  White could escape with Nd7.  But Rd4 implies black is blind to the dire threat of Ne6+, and black loses another rook to the white knight the same way he lost the first one.} 37. Ne6+ {Just like that.} Kf7 38. Ng5+ {Nope.  NxRd4.  The whole point of issuing the king/rook fork was to pick up a free rook.  This does give white the pawn at f3, but the rook is worth so much more, and that pawn isn't going anywhere.} Kf6 39. Nh7+ {Senseless, driving the black king out into the field where he wants to be.} Bxh7 {Well played.} 40. Rxf3+ Nf5 41. a4 Bg6 42. Rg2 Kg7 43. Ke2 Nh4 {Oh so lovely!  Black forks the white rooks.  It is a rook/knight trade.} 44. Rxg6+ {Or rook/bishop trade.} Nxg6 45. Ke3 Ne5 {Not again.  White cannot pass up KxR forever.  In this case, white plays Rg3+ to move the rook out of harm's way, then picks off the rook and pawn one after the other.} 46. Rg3+ Ng4+ {Blunder!  After KxR the knight cannot be moved.  Black loses rook, knight, and pawn in rapid succession.} 47. Kxd4 Kf6 48. Rxg4 Kf5 49. Rg1 Ke6 50. Rg5 Kf6 51. Rxd5 Ke6 52. Rxa5 Kd6 53. b4 Kc6 54. Rb5 Kd6 55. a5 Ke6 56. a6 Kd6 57. a7 Kc6 58. Kc4 Kd6 59. a8=Q Ke6 60. Qd5+ Kf6 61. Rb6+ Ke7 62. Qb7+ Kd8 63. Qa7 Kc8 {}
