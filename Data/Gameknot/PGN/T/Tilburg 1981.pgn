[White "Alexander Beliavsky "]
[Black "Bent Larsen "]
[Opening "Caro-Kann (B19), classical, Spassky variation"]

1. e4 c6 {Larsen opts for a Caro-Kann.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 {Beliavsky goes for the Classical Line.} h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Ngf6 {More common in this position is 10...Qc7.} 11. Bf4 e6 {An alternate line for Black is 11...Qa5+ And after the forced 12.Bd2... Comes 12...Qc7} 12. O-O-O Be7 13. Ne5 a5 {(?!) According to thorough GM & IM analysis, the wrong path. Black should have played 13...Nxe5 and limited the aggressive nature of White's position on the kingside.} 14. Rhe1 a4 {(?) Too far. White is fully mobilised and is now able to - and must! - attack.} 15. Ng6 {(!) The aim of this move is to disrupt the kingside. 15...fxg6 leads to 16.Qxg6+ Kf8 17.Rxe6 With the threat of 18.Nf5... Black cannot rely on a swap of queens either after 17...Qe8 since 18.Nf5! Qxg6 19.hxg6 Nd5 (19...Bb4 20.c3 Ba5 21.Bd6+ Kg8 22.Re7 OR 19...Bd8 20.Bd6+ Kg8 21.Rde1...) with the following 20.Rxe7+! Nxe7 21.Bd6 Re8 22.Re1... with decisive threats to follow.} Nd5 {(!?) A very wise counter. After 16.Nxh8? Nxf4 would trap the White knight (17.Qh7 Kf8) with Black gaining compensation for his lost material. Unfortunately for Larsen.....} 16. Nf5 {(!!) A fantastic tactical punchline to the position! This was the only way to continue attacking in this position.} Bf8 {Black has no other (rational) defence. If 16...Nxf4?? Then 17.Nxg7#. 16...fxg6 leads to 17.Nxg7+ Kf7 18.Qxg6+... pending 19.Nxe6+... Lastly, 16...exf5 and 17.Nxe7 Nxe7 (17...Nxf4 18.Nxc6+ Kf8 19.Qa3+... pending 20.Nxd8...) and 18.Bd6... 1-0} 17. Bd6 {(!)} Rg8 18. c4 Nb4 {Alternate variation : 18...fxg6 19.Rxe6+ Kf7 20.cxd5 Qg5+ (20...cxd5 is fruitless since 21.hxg6+ Kxe6 22.Re1+ Ne5 [else 22...Kf6 23.Nh4!... With the checkmate threat of Qf5#] 23.Rxe5+ Kd7 24.Qb5+ Kc8 25.Re8...) Continuing : 21.f4 Qxh5 22.Ne3 Nf6 (threatening 23.g4...) 23.Re5 Qh4 24.Bxf8 Rgxf8 25.dxc6... With a non-defendable attack from White.} 19. Qh3 {Threats of 20.Nxf8... And 20.Bxb4... Are looming large.} fxg6 20. Rxe6+ Kf7 21. hxg6+ Kxe6 22. Re1+ Ne5 23. Bxe5 {(!) 1-0 Beliavsky's candidate for an immortal game against one of the best chess players never to make World Champion. Larsen didn't castle, and as a result had to spend several tempi in passive defence to deflect attacks - hence ruining his development and any chance of winning.}
