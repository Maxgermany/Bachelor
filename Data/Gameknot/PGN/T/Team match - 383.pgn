[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Graz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 b5 {The Spanish opening, or Ruy Lopez. Most players leave b5 for a bit, preferring to prepare to get the king safe first. I don't like this variation as after 5. Bb3 black can't follow up with the normal na5 due to the hanging pawn on e5. White has played Bxf7+ even, but that's shaky at best.} 5. Bb3 Be7 6. O-O Nf6 7. d4 {7. d3 is the more conservative move, but I think this move puts a bit more pressure on. If 7...exd4 then 8. e5 causes trouble. If 8...ne4 then 9. Bd5! Threatening nxd4 regaining the pawn with lots of threats. If instead 8...ng4 9. Re1 followed by h3 and black is struggling to hold on to everything. Better for black is the game continuation, getting things developed and ignoring free pawns! } d6 8. c3 {I can ignore the apparent threat to the e4 pawn because of nxe4 Bd5! It really is poisoned...} Bg4 9. Be3 {The pawn is still poisoned although it's now not as straightforward.} Nxe4 {A big mistake! We'll see why...} 10. Bd5 {Nice :)} Qd7 11. Bxe4 {Now i guessed black's best move was f5. I think I would simplify with Bxc6 qxc6 d5 qd7 then I can head off the inevitable e4 with h3. The sacrifice Bxh3 is ok because I have nh2 holding everything together with two extra pieces. Black just goes for safety, allowing me to keep my extra piece unbothered.} O-O 12. d5 {The reason for this closing move is mainly because the knight has no good square. After 12...nd8 the rooks are disconnected, so c6 later is dangerous. After 12...na5 I have a nice choice between 13. nbd2 developing a new piece to meet the nc4 difficulty, or instead 13. B3, both of which look comfortable.  } Nd8 13. h3 {Putting e question to the bishop. Secretly hoping for Bxh3 out of desperation, after which the game is completely lost. He is forced to take here, for reasons that become apparent next move.} Bh5 {Loose pieces drop off, as someone famous once said! The bishop is unprotected!} 14. Nxe5 {Neat little tactic...} dxe5 15. Qxh5 {Which was of course the point of the knight sac.} f5 {This is probably hopeless for black, as I'm a clear piece up, but it's worth playing on while your opponent has pieces that aren't yet activated.} 16. Bc2 {Keeping out of trouble, still eyeing h7 and indirectly protecting d5 due to qxd5 Bb3! Note how black's knight can't come back into the game via f7 otherwise f5 falls. Everything is tied up.} g6 17. Qe2 {Keeping rd1 as a developing option.} Nf7 {This is probably a good move...as I say, it's worth playing on for a bit because the knight on b1 and rook on a1 are doing nothing. If black can cause difficulty before they get out, there is hope. I was expecting f4, for that very reason. After 17...f4 18. Bc1 (keeping d2 for the knight) f3! was one idea. After 19. gxf3 qxh3 black has hopes of perpetual check. However, I don't have to take on f3 so I think I am still winning. } 18. Rd1 {Now f4 doesn't pack the same punch, because the knight blocks the rook, and f3 can be met with qxf3.} Bd6 {I would have gone for g5 here, for the reasons stated before...black needs to act quickly or he will be lost.} 19. f3 {Now the bishop can retreat to f2 if necessary, not interfering with the knight or rook development.} f4 {This is just a few moves too late...now I am better prepared to deal with it.} 20. Bf2 Nh6 {I took some time to assess the threat with the black knight on f5. I decided it looked good, but was well controlled by the B on f2. This gives me time to develop my knight to it's optimal square.} 21. c4 {This just puts a bit of pressure on, while giving my knight a choice of squares. Lesson to be learnt here...even ahead material, the first plan is always to develop your worst pieces. There's no point being ahead a piece if it sits at home.} Nf5 22. Nc3 {Bxc4 was an option, but I think the knight is not that dangerous. By the time the forces are amassed, black will need them back in the centre for defense!} b4 {This is bad...it pushes my knight to its best square. There were better ways of defending b5 (like with a rook, developing a piece). Now the two pawns march together with optimal pieces supporting them.} 23. Ba4 {A little intermezzo. I noticed that Qe7 was bad, due to the threat of c5 later, trapping the bishop. Black didn't spot it, which gained me a tempo.} Qe7 24. Ne4 {The bishop pair now support the pawns and the rooks are about to provide heavy backup. I could almost play this position without the queen, it seems.} Qg7 {Necessary, to free up the bishop.} 25. c5 Be7 26. d6 cxd6 27. cxd6 Bh4 {He opts for the bishop exchange. It's fairly hopeless for black anyway, but always think about principles. It's usually good to exchange when up material, and he really can't threaten me seriously with just the knight. I still hesitated though, and nearly played Bc5. I'd guess Bc5 would be the computer choice, as it comes with real threats. The simplifying option means less chance for mistakes though, so the human approach is justified, I think. } 28. Bxh4 Nxh4 29. Rac1 {Just bringing the rook in with the threat of rc7, while black is fairly immobile.} Ra7 30. d7 Qe7 31. Rc8 Ra8 {I considered finishing with the flashy qxa6 but it's pointless to play a weaker move when the straightforward one wins.} 32. Rxa8 Rxa8 33. Qc4+ {A nice little intermezzo, allowing me to get to the support square for the pawn.} Kg7 34. Qc8 {There's no hope left, so black resigns. An imperfect game, I'm sure, but one which shows the value of development over pawn grabbing!}
