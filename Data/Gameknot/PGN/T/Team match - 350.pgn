[Opening "French (C15), Winawer, fingerslip variation"]

1. e4 e6 {I always thought white had the advantage at this opening because my c8 bishop is blocked by e6 pawn.} 2. d4 {AND white has control of the center.} d5 {guess I have to take my own share of it (center)} 3. Nc3 Bb4 {In case of exd5, my pawn would be alone with no pawn protecting it=> weak position} 4. Bd2 dxe4 {prevents previous position uncovers queen to attack d4 pawn} 5. Qg4 {forks g7 and e4 pawn} Nf6 {protects e4 pawn} 6. Qxg7 Rg8 {unpleasant position for black's queen takes control of semi-open file} 7. Qh6 Nc6 8. O-O-O Rg6 9. Qh4 Rg4 10. Qh6 Bf8 {move the queen around even if bishop loses any activity in the center } 11. Qh3 Nxd4 {natural take pawn and move knight to a dangerous position because of its extensive grasp on its surroundings} 12. Nb5 {seems wrong, Be3 is better, I think (pins knight to queen with rook)} e5 13. Qc3 c6 14. h3 {simply delays the inevitable: great gain of tempo. } Rg6 15. Na3 Nd5 {another pawn in the center and I get a "free" move} 16. Qa5 b6 {forced} 17. Qa4 Bd7 {threatens c5} 18. c4 {BLUNDER } c5 {queen can't run to c4 anymore because of pawn} 19. Nb5 {forced} a6 {Anything black does will end up with a lost queen.  0-1  this opening does have its advantages}
