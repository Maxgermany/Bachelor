1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. Nc3 {Hi all again! I hope you find these comments entertaining and informative. Alex388} O-O {Today we will learn how to attack a king castled position where the f pawn has taken in b3 or b6, i.e., pawns are in h2 (or h3), f2, f3, and some other chess principles in order to improve our chess.} 6. d4 {For the introduction, I would like to remind all the players a chess principle for openings that says: "Do not move the same piece twice or more if it's not necessary". Here White moves first d3 and now d4 without castling or bringing out his white bishop. Let's see how black punish this.} h6 {6. .. h3, a good move in this position, but nor really necessary, better was: 6. .. exd4 7. Nxd4 Nxe4 8. Nxc6 bxc6 (not dxc6 because of Qxd8 Bxd8 Nxe4) 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. Qe2 Re8 =- (the best is 10. ..f5 11. f3 Ba6 12. Qxa6 Nxc3+ 13. Kd2 Nd5, but it was very difficult to see it)} 7. Bxf6 Bxf6 8. Nd5 d6 9. dxe5 dxe5 {9. dxe5?!, better was Nxde5 (do not block your own bishop).} 10. Bc4 Be6 {10. .. Be6 it's not a very common place to develop our white bishop. 10. .. Bg4 bothers a lot!} 11. O-O a6 12. Qd3 Nb4 {12. .. Nb4?? Free piece! White can easily win playing 13. Nxb4} 13. Qc3 {White misses a big opportunity.} b5 {b5 is bad because we still have a free Knight. White can play: 14. Nxf6+ Qxf6 15 Bxe6 Qxe6 16. Qxb4 +-} 14. Qxb4 bxc4 15. Rad1 {White refuses the pawn and develops his Rook. It could have taken c4 pawn, since c6 is answered with the simple Qxc6. } Rb8 16. Qxc4 Bg4 {Now the Bishop arrives where it belongs!} 17. Nxc7 Qe7 18. Nd5 Qe6 19. h3 Bxf3 20. Nc7 {Be very careful with the intermediate moves. Calculate!! Here white doesn't calculate anything at all, and looses his queen for nothing!} Qxc4 21. gxf3 Qxc7 22. c3 {STOP! In this kind of position we must look at the poorly defended king, and the "wall" of pawns in f2 and f3 that prevents the help of other pieces in the defending of the King. Placing a piece (a Knight or a  Bishop in f4 makes a lot more difficult to defend the king as f3 and f3 pawns can't move. So, knowing that, a good plan here is to play Bg5 and then Bf4. After that brings the queen via e7, g5 and finally pass a rook via b6 or e6 and then to g6. With the bishop in f4 you should aim to h3, g2 and f3 weaknesses! } Qa5 {Unnecessary! Could have played Rxb2 immediately} 23. b4 Qxa2 24. Rda1 Qe6 25. Kh2 {Again, the plan Bg5, Bf4 sounds pretty devastating!} Qc4 26. Kg2 Rbd8 27. Rxa6 {Before getting exited for a free pawn, watch out!, maybe it's not free.} Qxa6 28. Rc1 Qb6 29. Rc2 Bh4 30. f4 Qg6+ 31. Kf3 Rd3+ 32. Ke2 Qxe4+ 33. Kf1 Rd1# {}
