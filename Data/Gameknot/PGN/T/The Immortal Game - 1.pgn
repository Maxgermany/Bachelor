[Opening "KGA (C33), bishop's gambit, Bryan counter-gambit"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 {For one thing, 3.Nf3 is the main follow up.  But, I believe that Anderson plays this, in an attempt to throw Kierseritzky off guard because, in my opinion, 3.Bc4 is not played by masters or GM's, in response to the KG.  So, it's something different.} Qh4+ {As with my most recent game against reversion, 3.Nf3 is played to prevent this.  And, I wouldn't know what to do here since castling isn't an option.  But, white, however, has no problem giving up that right.  This appears to be reversed psychology, as black appears to have the intitative.  My inference is that Anderson wanted Kieseritzky to get this early initative, just like with Joe's sacs with the idea that if you don't know how to follow up or continue the game you'll wind up in trouble.  That happens by becoming overly confident which I strongly believe is the case for Kieseritzky.  So, even though, technically speaking, black has the advantage, I'm already starting to favor white's position since it appears to only a matter of time before black gets too comfortable. } 4. Kf1 b5 {With that being said, black attacks the Bishop.  Maybe, he wants to give the pawn back, before white can do harm.  Aside from that, though, I've got no idea, so my inference is based solely on that.} 5. Bxb5 Nf6 {With that being said, Kieseritzky starts with his development.  And, Anderson continues with his, as well.  And, in the process white's going to harass the Queen which will gain some important tempii.  And, in professional games like this, tempo is important which is another reason that I favor white's position, believe it or not. } 6. Nf3 Qh6 {This will enable white to open up the center, as well as, get a nice pawn chain.} 7. d3 Nh5 {I don't know why Kieseritzky played this, but as black, the only move that would've come into consideration would be 7...Bb7 for a nice long diagnol which is why I wouldn't have hesitated to play it.} 8. Nh4 {This move also took me by surprise because I would've continued developing with Nc3.  Aside from that, the only other move that would've come into consideration is 8.b2 to financhetto the Q side.} Qg5 {But, unlike with what's noted above, I also would've played this.  Not only is the N attacked, but white's a file also appears to be under pressure.  As after Anderson retreats, Kieseritzky reattacks.} 9. Nf5 c6 10. g4 {Instead of retreating, however, Anderson prepares to exchange by reattacking.} Nf6 {But, Kieseritzky, however, refuses that.} 11. Rg1 {And, instead of exchanging, Anderson gives up a piece for a pawn.  Usually, it would be considered a mistake, but here it's safe to infer that it isn't.  Instead, I think it's a similar idea to when I gave up my Rook against Perry.  Therefore, 11...cxb5 is played, as one would anticipate, but I deem it to be a mistake that will, at this point, give Anderson a definite advantage.  It appears to be an example of becoming overly confident.} cxb5 12. h4 {As now, Anderson gains more time.  In this case, tempiik, as opposed to, tempo because of what comes next.} Qg6 13. h5 Qg5 14. Qf3 {That gain enables white to mobilize his Queen which is also very important.} Ng8 {As black, I would've played 14...Bc5, as opposed to, undevelop the N.  But, they see things that I don't, and I guess that black was going to lose it, or maybe, lose the game quickly, if he didn't.  Now, it gets more interesting, as Anderson knabs f7 which is important.  Although it didn't appear to be, this was a passed pawn because there were no pawns in front of them.  Although white's pawns are next to black, there was nothing to stop f4, except for white's next move which is why it was critical.  In the process, he gains more time since black's Queen is attacked.} 15. Bxf4 Qf6 16. Nc3 {As now, Anderson continues with his development.} Bc5 {Even more so then before, we now get into uncharted territory, somewhat similar to Janet's game against Charles in the second 4 Queens variation that I analyzed.  But, this is even more dramatic then both sides making a promotion with both Queens on the same board.  It starts with Anderson's next move.  That's because he intentionally gives things away.} 17. Nd5 Qxb2 {?? I don't know if really is a two Queiry move, but in the English System, ...Qxb2 is, in most variations, considered to be a losing blunder.  That's because Susan Polgar mentioned that taking this is a huge mistake that allows black to win.  Although the variations are different with what follows, I'm applying the same concept, regardless despite a different position because going into thought process, I believe that Kieseritzky has just become overly confident.  And, as he gets more and more comfortable, black's headed for disaster, big time, which does unfold later in the game.} 18. Bd6 {That becomes apparent with this move when black takes since I strongly believe that this is what Anderson anticipated.} Bxg1 19. e5 {The reason for that comment is because it's generally most common to take back, in order to avoid the loss of more material.  But, Anderson doesn't take back, and instead, allows black to take the other Rook with check.  When you don't blunder, then it is a winning strategy.  And, on a professional that is the case since Jack Stockel has showed me games where towards the end, Bobby Fischer, and I believe Caurana both sacked a lot of material in the end and won swiftly. } Qxa1+ 20. Ke2 Na6 {I'm not sure why black played, but I assume that Kieseritzky is planning to set up a mating with that piece, combined with his Bg1 and Qa1, but it's too little too late, especially with Anderson's next move.  And, now it is safe to conclude that the game is lost for black because of the mating attack.  Of more significance is that black won all of those pieces and being way ahead, you'd think the opposite.  But, Anderson, however, had it all planned out which means that there is no way out of it.} 21. Nxg7+ Kd8 22. Qf6+ Nxf6 23. Be7# {From my perspective, the moral of the story is the same as the advice that Jack Stockel gave me in our last game.  Don't get too comfortable just because you're ahead.  What's important to remember here is what I've also learned from the blitz Q sacs.  Just because you are getting a lot of material doesn't mean you're going to win.  Not being overly confident and comfy means understanding theory and knowing how to continue.  I think that Kieseritzky's failure to do so is what led to his downfall.  }
