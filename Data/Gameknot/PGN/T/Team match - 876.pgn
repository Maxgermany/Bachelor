1. d4 {One of my best games in quite awhile eventhough it finished almost a month ago. Although there were some mistakes by both myself and tag1153 the game ended very close. Hope you enjoy.} Nf6 {I decided to try something a little different for me.} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Bf4 {King's Indian defence, 3.Nc3} d6 {gains some central control} 5. h3 {probably a little early for this move, preparing for Nf3} O-O {castle to safety} 6. Nf3 Bf5 {standard development} 7. e3 {opening up the white bishop and adding more to the center} Nbd7 {Nc6 most likely leads to d5} 8.
