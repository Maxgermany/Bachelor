1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Bf5 3. e3 Nf6 {I prefer in this position to play c5. I guess that Nf6 is good eanogh as well.} 4. Be2 e6 5. O-O Bd6 {5... c5 is better. the Bishop can be on e7 as well as d6. it is more important to break white's center now (there might not another chance to play c5).} 6. c4 dxc4 {a must. 7. c5 is a strong threat.} 7. Bxc4 Ne4 {why wait with 0-0?} 8. Nc3 O-O 9. h3 {did ot get the move. 9.Qb3 is better as it pressures black's queen side.} a6 {9... Nd7 and 10... Nb6.} 10. Nxe4 Bxe4 {Black got a strong Bishop in the center. white Bishop on c1 is "stupid" as its got no where to go.} 11. Bd2 b5 12. Be2 c6 {12.... c5! 13. dxc5 Bxc5 14. Rc1 Nd7 and 15.... Rc8 with strong play in the center and on the queen side.} 13. Bc3 a5 14. Nd2 Bg6 15. e4 {??? loses the bishop on c3.} b4 {!} 16. e5 bxc3 17. bxc3 Be7 18. f4 h6 {there is no rush with that move. 18.... c5! is a must.} 19. Nf3 c5 {at last!} 20. Bd3 {with a material advantage it is better to exchange pieces.} Bxd3 21. Qxd3 Nc6 22. Rad1 Qd5 {! do not let white to play d5.} 23. c4 Qd8 24. d5 Nb4 {white played d5 but the diference is that he has no pawn on c3 so the black Knight can stand proud on b4.} 25. Qb1 exd5 26. a3 d4 {why giving up a piece back? isn't Nc6 good enough?} 27. axb4 axb4 28. f5 Bg5 29. g4 Ra3 {at least black has two passed pawns...} 30. Rfe1 {??? giving back the piece...} Rxf3 31. Kg2 Rc3 32. Rd3 Rxc4 33. Qb3 {a great black advantage. a piece up and lots of pawn running to the last row...} Rc3 34. Rxc3 dxc3 35. Re2 Kh8 36. Qc4 Qd4 37. Qb5 Be3 38. e6 Qe4+ 39. Kg3 Qf4+ 40. Kg2 fxe6 41. Qd7 exf5 42. Qe7 fxg4 {basicly, game is over... only a matter of time...} 43. Qxe3 Qxe3 44. Rxe3 c2 {the end...}
