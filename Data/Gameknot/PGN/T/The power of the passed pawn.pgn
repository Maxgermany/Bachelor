[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 {This was a league game.   I open with my standard.} c5 {The Sicilian.} 2. c3 {My favourite reply.   Sicilian players tend to dislike it, although it's becoming better-known.   It does tend to lead to significantly different games to the more usual lines.} Nf6 {I think 2. ... d5 is slightly ahead in the popularity stakes at the moment, but this is perfectly playable.} 3. e5 {Pretty much forced.} Nd5 {Standard.} 4. d4 {Staking a claim in the centre.} cxd4 {Still standard, although there's been a trend as far as I can see towards not taking this pawn (maybe more so in the 2. ... d5 lines).   The text frees c3 up for the knight, which plays into white's hands.   Leaving the pawns in situ just makes it a bit more difficult for white to develop.} 5. Nf3 {No rush to take the pawn as 5. ... dc hangs the knight (although black gets two pawns; I've only seen it played once, and after building up a nice attack, I screwed up and lost...)} d6 {5. ... Nc6 is more common here, but it all transposes.} 6. cxd4 {Standard.} Nc6 {Standard.} 7. Bc4 {7. Bb5 is also playable, but apparently much more dull.   With this move, white sets his eyes on the a2-g8 diagonal.} Nb6 {Standard.} 8. Bb3 {Dropping back along the same diagonal.} dxe5 {Still all book.} 9. d5 {The first non-obvious move of the opening; white sacs a pawn to try prise open black's position.   White has nothing after 9. de QxQ+ 10 BxQ e6.} Na5 {Standard.} 10. Nc3 {White ignores the threat to the bishop, instead looking to gain time for the attack.   If 10. ... NxB 11. QxN and white's focus is still on the same diagonal.} Bg4 {!?   A novelty for me anyway.   Now white has to choose between doubled b-pawns or f-pawns (the only other alternative, 11. Bc2, seems a bit too defeatist - it gives up on the a2-g8 diagonal and forces white into an entire change of plan, all while a pawn down).   In the World database on gameknot, this move has been played just 18 times compared to 172 times for 10. ... NxB.   It has a significantly better success rate for black too.   On the face of it, I don't understand why this move isn't played more often.} 11. Be3 {So I go for development.} Bxf3 {Black swaps.   On the world database, 11. ... NxB was played in each of the six occasions this position was reached.   On the gameknot database, 11. ... NxB was played in each of the four occasions this position was reached.   Again, I don't see any particular reason for this discrepancy.   Maybe black's just unnecessarily giving up the bishop pair here.} 12. Qxf3 {12. PxB is the preferred recapture on gameknot (this swap coming after NxB on the other side of the board).   I don't see what white has from that other than a long struggle to hold a draw, and indeed black has won on four of five occasions.} Nxb3 {Black swaps.} 13. axb3 {Forced.   Gameknot analysis gives white a slight edge here (+0.22)} g6 {Developing the bishop.   Maybe this is why 11. ... BxN isn't as popular; with the LSB on the board, black could play e6 here, with the option of continuing with dxe BxP.   Instead, 13. ... e6 now looks awkward for black, and white gets to use the time to bring up more reinforcements.} 14. O-O {I castle - often delayed in the c3 Sicilian, but it's the right time now.   A rook is going to come to d1 to back up the pawn.} Bg7 {Black's ready to castle; the bishop could be quite dangerous on that diagonal too.} 15. Rad1 {The first gripe from gameknot analysis.   I wanted to back up the pawn and get the rook out of the bishop's sights.   GK wants me to push straight away - 15. d6 ed 16. Rfd1 d5 (white's going to get the pawn back anyway; if not this one, then the b-pawn, it seems) 17. NxP NxN 18. RxN Qf6 19. Qe4 O-O and black has to swap off to avoid infiltration on the seventh.} O-O {Black returns the favour; GK wants to block the isolani with 15. ... Nc8, and white's game is awkward, it seems.} 16. Bc5 {White should still push; black has another chance to play Nc8.} Nd7 {But he goes here instead.} 17. Ba3 {Still eyeing d6 and getting ready to push.} a6 {Not sure what the plan here was tbh.   Black was better off covering his hanging b-pawn.} 18. d6 {So here we go.   Cat among the pigeons time!   Isolated pawns need to be pushed into the opposition's position anyway, so this is natural.} e6 {Black opts to push instead of take; I think 18. ... ed 19. BxP Re8 20. QxP is ok for white, who's got his pawn back at least; the threat is 21. Ba3 and the black knight is lost.   19. RxP, ganging up more directly on the pinned knight, seems to allow black time to defend b7.} 19. Qxb7 {Material equality restored.} Rb8 {Accepting a pawn swap to get rook activity.} 20. Qxa6 {I take.} Rxb3 {Black takes back; now it's black who has doubled pawns.} 21. Ne4 {Blocking the e-pawn (I didn't really want to allow 21. ... e4 22. NxP BxP; there doesn't seem enough left on the board for the hole on g7 to be an issue).   I'm also looking at jumping into c5, removing the knight blocking my pawn's way.} f5 {Wasn't expecting this!   Gameknot has no qualms anyway.   And it forces my hand; into c5 I go.} 22. Nc5 {GK wants me to go back to c3 and aim instead for b7.   It may have a point.} Nxc5 {Still, black swaps.} 23. Bxc5 {I take back.} Rxb2 {And this natural looking move is the first blunder of the game.   Black presumably overlooked white's reply.} 24. d7 {Natural and strong.   Now all white's play is directed towards promotion.} Rf7 {A second blunder in quick succession, it seems.   Gameknot advises black to cut his losses and play 24. ... Kf7 instead, protecting the e6 pawn.} 25. Qxe6 {25. Qc8 is met with 25. ... Bf6, I think.   So I need a stronger move.   This is it.   Material is equal again, but that pawn on d7 is a monster.} Rb8 {Black retreats.   Gameknot gives this as +4 now.} 26. Bd6 {Picking up another pawn.} Ra8 {Forced (otherwise Qe8+ decides)} 27. Bxe5 {Gameknot prefers 27. Ra1 here, removing an active black defender.   It gives a nice line - 27. Ra1 RxR 28. RxR Bf8 (28. ... QxP?? 29. Ra8+) 29. BxB KxB 30. Ra8! QxR 31. Qd6+ Kg7 32. d8=Q.   You can sac a lot just to get a pawn home!} Bxe5 {In the more mundane game, black captures.} 28. Qxe5 {I take back, and if 28. ... RxP?? 29. Qe6+ and black loses a rook.   So my pawn lives on.} f4 {A desperate attempt at counter-play, as we'll see later.   As so often though, the computer disagrees, and wants passive defence starting with 28. ... Qf8 instead, so the less valuable rook can take the queen's place behind the pawn.} 29. Rfe1 {Developing my last piece; I'd rather land the rook on e8 than the queen, of course.} Rf8 {Dropping further back.} 30. Qd5+ {I want the queen on d6, where it can support the rook on e7.   But I thought I'd take the time to move the king to a worse square.   I don't know if g7 or h8 are really any worse than g8 though.} Kg7 {Black goes here.} 31. Qd6 {And now I drop in to d6.} f3 {Black continues with plans against g2.} 32. Re7+ {The rook enters the game with check.} Rf7 {32. ... Kh6 33. Qe2+ and black's king looks like it's going to be getting more exposed.} 33. Re8 {? Missing a trick - the simple 33. Qe4+ forces 33. ... Kg7, when 34. Re8+ wins the queen.   This is still winning though - just less forcing.} Qg5 {Threatening mate in one.} 34. g3 {Pretty much forced, but quite solid.} Ra2 {Basically throwing in the towel.  34. ... Rd8 was forced, when white breaks through with 35. Qc7 Rf8 36. Rde1 (but not RxRf8?? RxRd1#!) Kh6 (what else?) 37. RxRf8 RxR 38. Re8 Qb4 (threatening mate again) 39. Qc1+} 35. d8=Q {Mate in ten.} Qh5 {Mate in four.} 36. Qe5+ {Not mate in four!   It's academic anyway; two of the queens come off and white's win is simple.   The mate was pretty - 36. Rg8+ Kh6 37. Q8f8+! RxQ 38. QxR+ Kg5 39. Qf4#.   Thanks for reading, and feel free to point out improvements!}
