1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Ng5 {Hmm, maybe this is a prelude to a trap.  Been a while since I played this line.} h6 {My opinion, the Knight does not belong this close to my lines at this time.} 4. e5 Nd5 5. Ne4 e6 6. c4 Nb6 7. g3 Nc6 8. Na3 Nxe5 {If there is a trap here, I need to see it.} 9. Nb5 Nbxc4 10. d4 Qa5+ 11. Nbc3 cxd4 12. Bd2 {I really wanted him to take that Queen Pawn.  Seems I never get what I want, just what I don't expect.} Nxd2 13. Kxd2 {Same fork was in play - he just wasn't buying.} dxc3+ 14. bxc3 Be7 15. f4 Nc6 16. Kc2 O-O 17. Bd3 d5 18. Nf2 Bd7 19. Qb1 Rab8 20. Bb5 Bf6 21. Nd1 a6 22. Bd3 b5 23. g4 {At this point, I was thinking of ways I could exchange my Knight for his Bishop.} b4 24. g5 {A sidebar; looks like I can gain a pawn to enhance my material edge.} hxg5 25. fxg5 Bxg5 26. Qb2 Bf6 {Pretty sure my Queen is safe; and the pins definitely seem to favor me.} 27. Qb3 {Ah, Queen for Rook and six points to the good already - no question about my next move.} bxc3 {And White resigned.}
