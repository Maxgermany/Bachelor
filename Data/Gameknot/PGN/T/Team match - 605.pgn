1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bc4 Bc5 5. d3 O-O 6. O-O d6 7. Na4 {Should never have done that} Bg4 {Because I would be pinned like this.} 8. h3 Bh5 9. Nxc5 dxc5 10. Bg5 {Trying the same pin but his case is different. I didn't feel like playing g4, it weakens my kings side.} Qd6 11. Qe2 {I was trying to bring my queen to e3.} Nd4 {Things just got worse.} 12. Qd1 Nxf3+ 13. gxf3 {Didn't worry too much about open flange in front of king because black bishop could easily replace the pawn.} Bg6 14. Kh2 Nh5 15. Rh1 {Trying to turn weakness into attack with a 2 rooks and protected h pawn.} Nf4 16. Qd2 Kh8 17. Rag1 c6 {Now, how to bring king behind f pawn?} 18. Bxf4 {Probably one of the my strongest move in the game.} exf4 {His pawn was protecting my king. And he can't move it.} 19. Qd1 {My king was closed in also. Trying to engage it somehow.} f5 20. exf5 Rxf5 21. Rg2 {Ah! now both rooks looked to be going for the kill.} Rh5 22. Kg1 Re8 23. Qd2 Rhe5 {Now I'm in trouble.} 24. Qc3 Bh5 {Even worse, my rooks are going to get pinned.} 25. d4 {Attacking the rook and protecting the pawn.} cxd4 {Didn't see the pawn, ouch.} 26. Qd3 Re5e1+ 27. Kh2 b5 28. Qf5 {My second best move. If he captures the pawn with the bishop I capture rook which he cannot return because of Qc8 threat which mates.} Bg6 {Nice move? I thought Rxh1 was my downfall} 29. Rxe1 {Clearly not very good but not too bad.} bxc4 {Why didn't he get my rook? 29. ...Rxe1 leads to 30.Rxg6 hxg6 31. Qc8+ Kh7 and if king gets to h7 I have no more checks and black can play his game.} 30. Rxe8+ Bxe8 31. Qc8 {No I have a rook against a bishop and I have an extra pawn. Can't believe I survived this one. I thick my resilience got him tired. } Qf8 32. Qa8 Qe7 33. Qb8 Qf7 34. Rg4 h6 35. Qxf4 Qxf4+ 36. Rxf4 {That's the end} Bh5 37. Rxd4 Bf7 38. Rd7 Bd5 39. Rxa7 Bxf3 40. a4 Kh7 41. a5 h5 42. a6 Kh6 43. Rc7 h4 44. a7 c5 45. Rxc5 {Prolific win. }
