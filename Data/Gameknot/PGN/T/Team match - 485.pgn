1. e4 {The Keres attack is a sharp but high stakes attack that declares war on the kingside. } c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e6 5. Nc3 d6 6. g4 {The Keres attack is a high stakes attack that puts the sicilan to the test. Black has to be super careful. However whit can get caught with his pants down if he advances without calculation. } Nf6 {Now days top players avoid Nf6 in order to not fall behind in tempo. } 7. g5 Nd7 8. Be3 {F4 is too ambitious for as it leaves serious holes in front of my king. Having just played G5 I bought myself a little sliver of time to devlop and defend. } a6 9. h4 {The overextended g-pawn has to be supported. Such is the trade off for super sonic pawn moves like this. In the end I banking the hope that black feel constantly under pressure and never has time to implement his own ideas.   Just is in the blitzkrieg tactic it's major drawback is that the force can advance beyond it's supply lines. This leaves the front most troops vulnerable to attack on the flanks and rear. The end result is you cut off and surrounded. } Be7 10. Qh5 {Adding more attacking potential to the kingside and preparing for queen side castling. } O-O {This is very dangerous since white has a huge space advantage on this side. However, in the mean time black is in no serious dangerous as the centre is still fluid and there are no open lines. Therefore, whites ultimate objective is to  1. solidify the centre because no flank attack can succeed if a counter attack be made in the centre.  2. Create open lines to king. This will usually mean a preice sacrifice at a later stage. } 11. O-O-O Re8 12. f4 Bf8 {? Black playing way too slow. } 13. Nxc6 {Removing a key central defender for black and creating an weak c6 to attack. I plan Qf3 to setup duel threats on f4 and c6. Even though black is holding strong this makes his task of defending all that much more difficult} bxc6 14. Qf3 Qa5 {With equality slipping out of blacks hands he has to try and create a sense of imbalance or complications. In truth black is seriously behind in development and as a result can not create an serious threat. To me this feels like I am bear and my supposed hunter is trying to slay me with a pellet gun. } 15. g6 {! I like this as it possess black with some tough choices. He is essentially force to reply with h6 because volunteering to open lines is suicide. } fxg6 16. h5 d5 {Black is doing ok in trying to create complication however a cool hand approach usually wins the day. During over the board play I woul never get myself into these position voluntarily. But since I have time I can think things though } 17. hxg6 h6 18. Bh3 {As a result of d5 a new target has been aquired. E6 is the fallout of FxG6. This demonstrates the dangers of opening lines if your opponent has a space advantage. The rule is is if you are cramped seek to exchange pieces not pawns. Also avoid opening lines because this result in the side with space advantage to increase piece mobilty and threats.   However the truth black asked dor it by castling into the pawn storm. Black would be still fine if he paid more attention to piece development and castling away from my space advantage. } Bb4 19. exd5 {Seizing the pawn as Bxc3 is ok white because the e6 weakness.  If } Bxc3 20. Bxe6+ Kf8 {Black thinks that Bxc3 was ok but...} 21. Rxh6 {! this does deserve the round applause. Remember that I told you a long time ago that this was coming. } gxh6 22. bxc3 Qa3+ {QxC3 is a tougher defense } 23. Kd2 Rxe6 24. dxe6 {Black resigns as there is no way to stop the pawn without heavy losses. }
