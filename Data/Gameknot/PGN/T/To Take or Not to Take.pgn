1. e4 {I'm white.  Standard e4!} c5 2. Bc4 e5 3. Qf3 {I know this isn't the wisest course of action.  I was more or less making sure he was paying attention. } Qf6 {An interesting reply.  Now the ladies take center stage...} 4. d3 d6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Nd5 {Now he's in a pickle.  He has to take my Q or move his very carefully. } Qxf3 7. Nxf3 {Elizabeth has left the building, now off to partake in my nasty scheme.} Kd7 {Ahh...black does not fail to forget my royal steed and the upcoming fork.} 8. Ng5 Nh6 9. O-O f6 {Now, it's here that I see supreme infiltration.  } 10. f4 {If he takes pxN then my pxp leaving my R the open F-file. :)   Not to mention my pawn will be attacking his N so he'll have to move him swiftly and give my Rook the f7 square for check.  This take is what I named the game after, to take or not to take.  Look a gift horse in the mouth? } fxg5 11. fxg5 Ng4 {Plan has worked thus far...} 12. Rf7+ {Note he can't move to e6, because N-c7 is #} Ke8 13. Nc7+ Kd8 14. Nxa8 Be7 15. h3 {he resigns here, his Knight is toast no matter where he moves.  he would be -6 after the N moves and I take.  }
