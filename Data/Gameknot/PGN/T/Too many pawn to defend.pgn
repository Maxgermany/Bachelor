1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 {geniusacamel plays the classical QGD varation which is a favoriate of mine.  For the time being white focuses on develop king safety before embarking on attacking in the centre.  } h6 {Black plays ...h6 which is rarely seen these days. The idea I think is to avoid the exchange variation and classical main lines.  Finally, it helps negate any future pressure on c7  } 5. Bf4 {If white ever plays this move it is now or never.  } Bd6 {I prefer blacks other option the ambitious  Alternative variation: 5... Bb4 6. cxd5 exd5 7. e3 O-O Black still has problems but far less drastic than doubled d-pawns. } 6. Bxd6 cxd6 {?! Alternative variation: best is 6... Qxd6 7. e3 O-O 8. c5 Qe7 9. b4 b6 } 7. cxd5 {Alternative variation: 7. e3 dxc4 8. Bxc4 O-O 9. O-O a6 10. Bd3 Nc6 11. h3 } Nxd5 8. Nxd5 exd5 {Major long term score here for white.  Those doubled D-pawns will be hard to defend.  } 9. e3 O-O 10. Be2 {I prefer  Alternative variation: 10. Bd3 Nc6 11. O-O Qb6 12. Qd2 } Qb6 11. O-O {Alternative variation: defending the pawn allows black to exploit the fact that the LSB is on e2 instead of d3 example:  11. Qd2 Nd7 12. O-O Nf6 now white has to start worrying about a knight jump to e4.  } Qxb2 12. Qd3 Qb6 13. Rfb1 Qd8 14. Qb5 {winning back the pawn.  } Nd7 15. Qxd5 Nf6 16. Qb3 Bf5 {black has nice active pieces for compensation.  } 17. Rbc1 Qd7 18. Bb5 Qe7 { } 19. Ne1 {I think white's idea is to exchange bishops on d3 to create a good post for the knight. } a6 {?! serves no purpose but creates another weakness on b7 to defend.  Alternative variation: 19... Rfc8 20. Bd3 Bxd3 21. Nxd3 Qd7 } 20. Bd3 Be6 21. Qa3 Nd5 22. g3 f5 {Play pawns in front of a castled king is always a risky idea. OTB board I doubt I would have played this move. Best in my eyes is 22. ...Nf6 because it creates no further weaknesses. } 23. Rab1 {...a6 comes back to haunt black.  } Rac8 24. h4 {preventing g5 and threatening h5 later on. } Nf6 {excellent play by both sides here. But black has a lot of pawn weaknesses.  } 25. Qa5 Rxc1 26. Rxc1 Qd8 27. Qb4 Qd7 28. a4 Nd5 {wow very impressive play by black here.  } 29. Qb2 Rc8 30. Rxc8+ Qxc8 { white has a very slim chance of success here. The only thing that I think white has going for him at the moment is a better pawn structure. Black two major weaknesses on b7 and d6 but both can be defended by the queen.  } 31. Ng2 Qc3 {black does the logical thing to offer the exchange of queens. But white does not have to oblige.  } 32. Qb1 {white does the right thing and avoids the exchange.  } g6 {?!  seeking to prevent  Alternative variation: 32... Qc8 [?!] 33. h5 Kf7 34. Nh4 Ne7 35. e4 fxe4 36. Bxe4 d5 37. Bg6+ but again creates further weakness.  } 33. e4 {!} Nb4 {? in the midst of all the complexity black over reaches.  Alternative variation: 33... fxe4 34. Bxe4 Qb4 35. Qxb4 Nxb4 36. Bxb7 a5  is most likely a draw. } 34. Bf1 {now white has the threat of d5 } Ba2 {? Alternative variation:  Black has to try  34... a5 35. d5 Bf7 36. exf5 Qc2 37. Qa1 Nxd5 38. fxg6 Qxg6 39. Qd4 b6 40. Bc4 Qf5 41. Kh2 Qf3 } 35. Qd1 Bb3 36. Qe2 Qc2 37. Qe3 {A winning position for white. The pawns in front of the enemy king will fall.  } Bf7 38. Qxh6 Qxe4 39. Nf4 {and so goes g6. } Qe8 40. h5 gxh5 41. Qg5+ Kf8 42. Qf6 {black resigns.  }
