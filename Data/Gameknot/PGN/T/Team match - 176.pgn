1. e4 {This is a short cheeky game in which I blundered but managed to catch out my opponent with a checkmate while still in the opening stage of the game.  I was relying on my opponent wanting to exchange pieces after I lost a piece, and also offered up a somewhat innocent looking exchange.  Enjoy!} e5 2. a3 Nf6 {Attacking pawn, very standard} 3. Nc3 {Defending...} d5 {Attacking...} 4. exd5 Nxd5 5. h3 {Didn't expect this, it kind of threw me a bit and I lost my flow...} Bd6 {So I threw my knight away!!} 6. Nxd5 {As expected! Now I really need to think carefully...} O-O {Lets get the king safe first!} 7. Bc4 Be6 {Attackung the knight} 8. Ne3 {Knight moves to safety and protects bishop.  I assume white will want to exchange wherever possible....everything else being neutral of course.  it is my job now to take great care of my pieces!!  But I do have an idea...} Qf6 {Maybe not the best move, but I am relying on white wanting to exchange bishops.} 9. Bxe6 fxe6 {So I take with the pawn, naturally! } 10. d3 {Being in the early stage of the game my gamble pays off...} Qxf2# {Checkmate!  What I learned from this is whatever the stage of the game it is always important to consider the threats and defences of both sides.  I got caught out by some unusual pawn moves but I got my revenge by moving the queen out early and offering up an exchange.}
