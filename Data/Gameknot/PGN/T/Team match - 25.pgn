[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {White opens with the most popular} e5 {Blacks replies with the same.} 2. Nf3 {Again the most popular move, attacking e5.} f6 {But this is a bad way of defending it. 2...Nc6, d6 or Nf6 are all better.} 3. Nxe5 {Because white can just take here.} fxe5 {This natural recapture is another blunder, 3....Qe7 is an improvement, and playable, although inferior for black.} 4. Qh5+ {This check is deadly. Now 4....g6? loses the Rh8 with 5. Qxe5+ forking King and Rh8, so....} Ke7 {This is the only other move.} 5. Qxe5+ {Another check.} Kf7 {This is forced of course.} 6. Bc4+ {Another excellent move by white checking again.} Kg6 {This is another blunder and there is a forced mate for white now. 6.....d7-d5 lasts longer, but with three pawns for the knight and an awesome attack there is a massive advantage to white.} 7. Qf5+ {Correct move again.} Kh6 {Forced again.} 8. d4+ {White correctly develops with tempo, giving check again.} g5 {This is the best move for black.} 9. Bxg5+ {This is not the best though. 9. h2-h4! instead mates in 10 at the most.} Qxg5 {Black takes back.} 10. Qxf8+ {White regains the piece just lost, and has piece for three pawns.} Qg7 {The best block.} 11. Qxc8 {White gets his piece back, and is 3 pawns up, but no longer has a mating attack.} Qxg2 {Gameknot post-game computer analysis gives this as a mistake and instead thinks that best for both sides is Ne7 12. Qxc7 Qxg2 13. Qf4+ Qg5 14. Qg3 Rf8 15. Nd2 Ng6 16. O-O-O Nc6 17. c3 Qf4 18. Qh3+ Qh4 19. Qxd7 Rad8 20. Qc7 Rc8 21. Qg3 Rxf2 22. Rdf1 Rcf8 23. e5 Nce7 24. Rxf2 Rxf2 25. Qxh4+ Nxh4 26. Ne4 Rg2 27. Rf1 Nhf5 28. Bb3 Rxh2 29. Nd6 Nxd6 30. exd6 Ng6 For this analysis see https://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=28183317&rnd=0.19559123737513717} 12. Rf1 {White saves his rook.} Qxe4+ {Another pawn goes.} 13. Be2 {White blocks.} Qc6 {A final mistake allowing a mate in four. Gameknot considers this the best.  Qg6 14. Nc3 Kg7 15. Qxb7 Nc6 16. Qxa8 Nf6 17. Qb7 Nxd4 18. Rd1 Nxe2 19. Nxe2 Re8 20. Qxc7 Kf7 21. Rd2 Qg5 22. b3 Qe5 23. Qxe5 Rxe5 24. f3 Nd5 25. Kf2 Rh5 26. Kg1 Kf6 27. Ng3 There is still massive advantage to white, but at least black is still in the game. Find the mate in four!} 14. Qf8+ {So white checks on f8 again. https://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=220597} Kg5 {The king is forced up the board.} 15. Rg1+ {The rook joins in the fun. A purist may say 15. h4+ is more accurate as it mates more quickly, as now black could delay the mate a move with Qg2, but it makes little difference.} Kh4 {King runs up the board.} 16. Qf4+ {Another queen check.} Kh3 {Forced!} 17. Qg3# {And it is over. Thank you for reading, please rate this annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing.
