1. e4 d5 {I'm still experimenting with the scandinavian and its mostly working well for me} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. d4 {This was rather unexpected as it puts no pressure on my queen, I was expecting Nc3} Nc6 {This was to attack the pawn but I think now that I should have played Nf6 in preference} 4. c3 e5 5. Qe2 Qa5 {threatens Nxd4} 6. Bd2 Be6 7. Nf3 exd4 8. cxd4 Bb4 9. Nc3 Nf6 10. Ng5 {An early attack from white but I am not sure it accomplishes much, I would be more concerned with getting my king safe. } O-O-O 11. Nxe6 Rde8 {threatening Rxe6 pinning the queen} 12. O-O-O Rxe6 13. Qc4 Rd8 {prevents the fork from d5} 14. Nb5 Bxd2+ 15. Rxd2 {I don't like this move from white, not that there was a lot better that I can see, it allows Re1+ } Re1+ 16. Kc2 {I was expecting Rd1} Nb4+ 17. Kb3 {This is probably the best of the options as Kc3 loses to Nd5+,  Qxd5 (forced due to threat of Kb3 Qxa2#)  Nxd5 and white is lost} Qxa2+ 18. Kxb4 {Again probably the better option due to Kc3, Ne4+, Kb3, Nxd2+ forking the queen} Nd5+ 19. Kc5 b6+ 20. Kc6 {forced} Qxc4+ 21. Bxc4 Nb4# {Thanks for reading please comment}
