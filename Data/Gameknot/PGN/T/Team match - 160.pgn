[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 {Here is a refreshing reminder never to give up.  Or if you prefer, the stupid loss of a pawn is never the end of the game.} d5 {I have bee experimenting with the Center Counter (Scandinavian) Defense as an alternative to the French Defense and other fairly rock-ribbed defenses.  Especially when its reputation seems to be a bit suspect, both for the early forced arrival of the black queen to the center, and also for the easy development for white that buys time to build a strong position.  And yet, it does not die, making me think that if grandmasters play it, then I can certainly try it.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nf3 {The first surprise.  I was expecting the conventional 3. Nc3 Qd6 or Qa5, etc.} Bg4 {There seems little reason not to apply some pressure early. } 4. Nc3 Qe6+ {A queen trade before the sixth move?  From my research, it appeared there were many instances of this very sequence in grandmaster practice.  Does an early queen trade presage an early draw?  In those games and in this, there is little opportunity for a draw.  I also considered 4...Qh5 5. Be2 Nc6 6. O-O  0-0-0  7. d3  Nf6 8. h3 Bd7 9. Bf4 Qf5 10. Bg3 g5 11. a4 h5 12. h4 gxh4 13. Nxh4 Qh7 from Westphal-Kiel, Landesliga Ost in 2002.  Kiel won this game, but only after some serious torture in the middle-game.  Still other options at black's fourth move include 4....Qa5, 4...Qd6, and 4...Qd8. } 5. Qe2 Qxe2+ {5...Nf6 6. Qxe6 Bxe6 is certainly possible.  Alternatives include 5...c6 and 5...Nc6.} 6. Bxe2 Nc6 {6...c6 and 7...Nd7 is another option, in order to keep the queen-side available for long castling.  Or not to castle at all, which occurred in Slingerland-Caspi, Unive open in 2010.  Caspi won that game.} 7. d3 {White can apply some pressure starting with 7. h3 Bh5 8. g4 Bg6 9. Bb5 e6 10. Ne5 Ne7 11. d3 0-0-0 12. Bxc6 Nxc6 13. Nxg6 hxg6 14. Be3 Be7 15. f4 Nb4, but black seems to hold well and eventually wins this game (Laubert-Kasparov, S., 23rd Czech Open A in Pardubice, CZE, 2012). } e5 {Once white has played 7. d3, which locks in his king's bishop, I saw no reason to hold back 7...e5.  7...e5 restrains his 8. Bf4 and the problems on c7 that occur after 9. Nb5.  Of course, 8. Nb5 is still possible, and it seems to force 8...Rc8.  So it may be that 7...a6 before 8....e5 is best.} 8. Be3 Bb4 9. O-O Nf6 {I debated about playing 9...a6 first, simply to avoid some complications starting with 10. Nb5.  But I decided that it was best to protect my bishop at g4 first.} 10. Ne4 Nd5 11. c3 Bd6 {The computer indicates that 11...Be7 is best.} 12. h3 Bh5 13. Nxd6+ cxd6 14. Bg5 {Soon commencing a long trek to be captured in the corner with the king having to defend it.} f6 15. Bh4 Nf4 {Finding a strong position that pushes the white pieces around for awhile} 16. Bd1 O-O-O 17. Ne1 Bxd1 18. Rxd1 g5 {Starting a massive pawn front on the king-side.} 19. Bg3 h5 20. f3 Ne2+ {Now is the time to capture the bishop, before it can retreat.} 21. Kf2 Nxg3 22. Kxg3 f5 23. Nc2 f4+ 24. Kf2 Rhe8 {I knew that d4 was in the offing, so it seemed to require some rook support on the e-file} 25. d4 d5 {Computer far prefers 25...e4, and I see why now.} 26. dxe5 Rxe5 27. Rfe1 Rde8 {27...Rde8  After this block-head move, I could expect to lose the game. } 28. Rxd5 {Of course!  Quite brilliant, and he had every reason to think he had a sure win.  But wait....} Rxd5 29. Rxe8+ Kd7 30. Re2 Rd1 {I could only hope to keep up the pressure on the second rank and maybe force some concession later.  But I was down pawn with no serious compensation.  The loss seemed slow but certain. } 31. a3 Kd6 {I decided to move up my king just enough to support ....Ne5, and then see if I could force something more.  He could not play 32. Re8 to move 39. Rd8+ and take my rook, since the knight guarded my e8 square.} 32. g3 {He seized on the good idea of weakening the pawn phalanx enough to start picking off the pawns one by one on the king side.  I could merely wait and hope for a break somewhere. } Ne5 33. Re4 {Out of the blue came a major saver for my game!  I had to pray to Cthulhu for making this possible!  } Rd2+ {This breaks it open, costs him two pawns, and gives me the chance of at least one but possibly two connected passed pawns.} 34. Re2 fxg3+ 35. Kf1 Nxf3 36. Rxd2+ Nxd2+ 37. Kg2 h4 {From this point on, his king is condemned to guard the prison in the corner of his f-file, g-file and h-file.  He cannot venture anywhere unless he either sacrifices his knight for the advanced pawns, or otherwise stops the pawns in their tracks.  In the meantime, the black king is a foot soldier that cannot be stopped.  The black knight is ideally placed to fence in the white monarch until the black king can advance to support the pawns. } 38. Nd4 Kd5 39. Nf5 {His first chance to sacrifice his knight for the pawns.  But doing so means that his king is still condemned to that corner until the final pawn is picked off, and the black king will be feasting on all of his remaining pawns on the queen-side.} Ke5 40. Nd4 Ke4 {The advance of the black king continues.} 41. b4 g4 {Now come the two advanced passed pawns, whether he plays hxg4 or not.} 42. a4 {If 42. hxg4, then 42...Kf4 43. Kh3 Nf3 (in order to seize the pawn's queening square) 44. Ne2+ Ke3 and now white is forced either to retreat the knight to c1 or sac the knight. } gxh3+ 43. Kxh3 Nf3 {This secures the square g2. After 44. Ne2, Ke3 forces the knight sac. } 44. Nb5 {Jousting at windmills, at this point.} Ne1 45. Nxa7 g2 46. Kh2 h3 47. Nc6 Nf3+ {Starting mate in 4.  }
