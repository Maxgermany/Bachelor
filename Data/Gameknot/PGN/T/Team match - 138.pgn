1. c4 {English Opening.} c5 {EO, Symmetric Variation} 2. e4 e5 3. d3 d6 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bg5 f6 6. Bh4 g5 7. Bg3 g4 8. Nh4 Nge7 9. Be2 h5 10. O-O d5 11. cxd5 Nd4 12. Qa4+ Bd7 13. Qd1 f5 14. exf5 Nexf5 15. Nc3 {This is not a counter threat.  Black has a knight and queen focused on Nh4, protected only by a bishop (Bg3).  White would have been better off trading.} Nxg3 {Here NxNh4 seems like the better move.} 16. hxg3 {Using the f pawn instead would have opened the f file for the rook.} a5 17. a4 Nxe2+ 18. Qxe2 Qb6 {Although black threatens Pb2, QxPe5+ gives white Rh8.  Sweet deal.} 19. Nb5 {Pe5 was undefended, and the h rook ripe and ready to be plucked.} Bxb5 20. axb5 Qxb5 {...still doable.} 21. Ng6 {But probably not now.} Rg8 22. Qxe5+ Kd8 {Qf6+ could give white Bf8, provided the black king does not move out to d7 or c7.} 23. Qf6+ {:)  Yes.} Kc7 {Ok here Qf7+ snares the black bishop for free if black interposes it.  If not, QxRg8.} 24. d6+ Bxd6 25. Rfe1 Rae8 26. Re7+ {Oops.  The bishop gets to eat that rook.  NxB isn't a good trade at all.} Bxe7 27. Qf4+ {Qf5 would protect the knight while attacking Ph5.  Here black can interpose a bishop, threatening the queen.  White ends up losing the knight.} Bd6 28. Qf7+ {Actually, that is pretty good--it saves the knight.} Kb8 29. Kh2 Rxg6 {Interesting.  QxRg6 trades a rook for knight, helping white regain lost ground.  Plus, QxRg6 protects Pd3 from QxPd3.} 30. Qxg6 Qxb2 {Here white is strongly recommended to QxRe8+.  Black loses both rooks.} 31. Rxa5 {That could have waited.  The rook was much better value.} Rd8 32. Qxh5 {Blunder.  The white queen is lined up with the king.  If black has a piece covering h8 (the queen is), black could swap his rook for the white queen with Rh8.} Qxf2 {Fortunately black appears to have missed that move.} 33. Qxg4 {White would probably have been better off with Qg7.  Rh8+ forces white to interpose the queen, again trading queen for rook.  Worse yet, KxR3 ends wwith QxPg3#.} Rh8+ 34. Qh3 Rxh3+ 35. Kxh3 Qxg3# {}
