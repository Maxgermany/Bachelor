[Opening "KP (B00), Nimzovich defence"]

1. e4 Nc6 2. Nf3 {A friendly game against a coworker. I'm white and start with the Open Game and he replies with the Nimzovich. White's reply is mainline but black's 2. ... Nf6 will give black some problems.} Nf6 3. e5 Ne4 4. d3 Nc5 5. d4 {White hunts the black knight. 3. ... Ne4?! was probably not black's best move for the knight. The experts recommend 3. ... Ng4 or 3. ... Nd5, but really, after 2. ... Nf6 black has seriously hindered his effort to equalize the opening. White spends a couple moves developing a strong center with tempo, chasing the black knight. Now black's best move is probably just 5. ... Na6, a dismal home for the proud king's knight. Naturally, both moves on the e-file are off limits. 5. ... Ne6? loses a piece to a fork with 6. d5.} Ne4 6. Bd3 {5. ... Ne4?! was a mistake that will cost black even more time and space.} Nxf2 7. Kxf2 {Black's knight had no safe moves; they were all covered by white's pawns and pieces. Black could defend with a pawn, preferably the d-pawn, despite the en passant, for if white does capture en passant, black recaptures with the endangered knight and is saved. Thank you yoshark for correcting my hasty annotation. With 6. ... Nf2? Black gives up his knight, capturing a pawn and exposing the white king, but that's not enough compensation for the knight.} d6 8. Re1 Bg4 9. h3 Bxf3 10. Qxf3 {Black would do well to avoid exchanges at this point. He is behind in material; every exchange brings him closer to the endgame where he will lose due to his material deficit. Better was 9. ... Bd7. 9. ... Bh5 still exchanges material after 10. g4 Bg6 11. Bxg6 hxg6.} Nxd4 11. exd6 {Wow. This is what happens when I play casually. Well, thankfully not every time I play casually. Black captured a pawn with 10. ... Nxd4, but in return, his own pawn at b7 is now en prise. White should capture that pawn. OK, this is what happened. I was engaged in a little fantasy chess. I do that a lot. I imagine some critical piece/pawn is missing, or elsewhere, and then I find a good move in the imaginary position. In this case, it was black's pawn on e7 that I was imagining was gone. Some of my best moves ever have come from exploring a fantasy position - once I know I have a checkmate, or winning combo, all I then have to do is find a way to remove the piece that enables the combo. So I worked out a line that wins black's a8 rook - but for it to work, that pawn on e7 can't be there, in which case, check with 11. exd6+ keeps white's queen safe. Then I got distracted and returned and carelessly played 11. exd6?? anyway, forgetting that it was a fantasy combo. Moved too fast, too casually. And my queen pays the price.} Nxf3 12. dxc7 Qxc7 13. Bb5+ Kd8 14. Kxf3 {OK, damage control time. White is down a queen+pawn for two pieces, but is a little more developed and has a little more freedom. Time to make that work a miracle.} e6 15. Bf4 {Develop with tempo.} Bd6 16. Rd1 {15. ... Bd6? is a mistake that costs black his bishop. 16. Rd1 pins the bishop to the king. It is now pinned twice in fact, and black has no defenders to save it.} Ke7 17. Bxd6+ {16. ... Ke7 was a mistake that costs black even more material. In fact, it allows white to equalize, numerically, though in reality the advantage of three pieces to two may still favor white slightly.} Qxd6 18. Rxd6 Kxd6 19. Nc3 {Developing and freeing the white rook.} a6 20. Bd3 Ke7 21. Re1 Rac8 22. Nd5+ {The black pawn on e6 is pinned and cannot capture the white knight. White is planning a strike at those two queenside pawns, hoping to create a passed pawn to gain a winning edge.} Kf8 23. Nb6 Rc6 24. Nc4 g6 25. Na5 {Continuing with the plan.} Rb6 26. b3 {Black defends and initiates a counterstrike against white's pawn on b2.} Kg7 27. Be4 {The threat is obvious. White plans to trade two pieces for a rook and pawn, thus passing white's c-pawn and clearing it to run straight for promotion. But there is a subtler threat.} Rc8 28. Nc4 {Black's rook on b6 is already trapped. 27. ... Rc8? will cost black the exchange.} Rb4 29. a3 {28. ... Rb4? was the mistake that gives white the winning edge he needs. The black rook is now trapped. Truthfully, after 27. ... Rc8?, black had no better alternatives.} Rbxc4 30. bxc4 Rxc4 31. Bxb7 Rxc2 32. Bxa6 Rc3+ 33. Re3 {Material is exchanged, and white comes out with a material lead of a bishop for a pawn. Both sides have a passed pawn, but while black's is obstructed by the white king and rook, white's passed pawn has a clear path to promotion.} Rc6 34. Bb5 Rc5 35. a4 Rf5+ 36. Ke4 {Time to turn white's king into an aggressor.} Rf2 37. g4 f5+ 38. Ke5 {Black wants to trade pawns, white is quite all right with that. But, let's win one while we're at it.} fxg4 39. hxg4 Rg2 40. Re4 h5 41. gxh5 gxh5 42. Kxe6 {Done.} Rg6+ 43. Kf5 {White's king wants to squash a pawn.} Rf6+ 44. Kg5 {Black's checks are merely driving the white king to where he wants to go. Now the pawn must fall.} Rh6 45. Re7+ {44. ... Rh6? was the final move that clinches the loss for black. With 45. Re7+ white drives the black king away from defense of his rook.} Kf8 46. Re8+ {Black moved to threaten white's rook. White could win with the simple 46. Kxh6 Kxe7, but black's king will be close enough to stop white from promoting his pawn. White would then have to kill the black pawn, then bring his king over, use his king and bishop to chase black away from a8, and then finally promote the pawn. Long and tedious. With 46. Re8+! White finds a faster win.} Kg7 47. Rg8+ {Icing on the cake. Black must capture the white rook sooner or later. If 47. ... Kh7, 48. Rh8+ forces black to capture on h8. These two moves by white force the black king one step farther away from the a-file, just exactly enough to ensure a quick and painless promotion rather than a longer tedious one.} Kxg8 48. Kxh6 h4 49. a5 {Time to get this game into the books.} h3 50. Bc6 {The white bishop is the supreme unit on the battlefield, and the h1-a8 diagonal is his turf. This bishop is a 19-point bishop. He's a bishop, so he's worth three points. He also guarantees the white pawn's promotion, that's an 8 point gain for white, and he denies the black pawn's promotion, preventing an 8 point gain for black. 3+8+8 = 19, hence, a 19-point bishop.} Kf8 51. a6 Ke7 52. a7 Kd6 53. a8=Q {All over now but the shouting.} Kc7 54. Be4 {This move gives the white queen room to operate, as the bishop surrenders a bit of his turf to get out of the queen's way. I entered the conditional moves for every combination from this point. White mates in 6, beginning with 54. Be4.} h2 55. Qc6+ Kd8 56. Qb7 Ke8 57. Bc6+ {Black could have delayed with a spite check, 56. ... h1=Q+, but it only delays the checkmate by one move.} Kf8 58. Qg7# {Final Position. Not a bad game for my friend's initial foray into GameKnot. In fact, this is now my 5th longest game on GameKnot. Well played.}
