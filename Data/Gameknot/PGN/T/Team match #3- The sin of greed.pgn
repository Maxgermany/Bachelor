[Opening "Sicilian defence (B30)"]

1. e4 {I was so close to winning this game, and I was thinking at that time that this would be my best checkmate ever on GK. Two fatal mistakes later and that was snatched away from me!} c5 {I;d like to try something different with my opening sometime, but for now, I'm happy with the Silican} 2. Nf3 {bringing out the knight} Nc6 {my usual move} 3. Bc4 {this is supposed to be a bad response to the Silican, but I'm not sure how to take advantage of this move...} g6 {so I continue with normal development, preparing to fianchetto that bishop (thank you cadavre)} 4. c3 {I guess this move was played to stop me advancing my knight} Bg7 5. d4 {bringing out his center pawn - White need to think about castling to protect his king} Nf6 {again, normal development, } 6. Qd3 {I'm not too sure why White decided to play this...I'd consider 6.Nbd2} O-O {this is where my move of memorised moves end - any move I make after this is based on my own decisions} 7. Bf4 {hmmm.... again, White's motives escape me...for now (I've decided when annotating that unless it's significant to my analysis, I'll speak without the benefit of hindsight)} d5 {preparing to challenge the center...} 8. exd5 Nxd5 {now there's a clear file to White's king. (though White's king can easily be defended by the bishop or knight)} 9. Be5 {now I realise the plan of that bishop - trading off my strong bishop} Nxe5 {I decide to trade with knight instead} 10. dxe5 {in my first game with fiver (my other team match - I'll annotate that one as well) he was kind enough to sent me some basic chess rules from his team forum around mid-game. Here's one of them in play now - 'always attack with the weaker piece' (in this case, White attacks with the pawn instead of the knight) I know anyone looking at this annotation probably already knows this but I just thought I'd throw this in} e6 {? I thimk I played this to free up the black queen, but it blocks my own white bishop in} 11. O-O {castling} a6 {preparing to chase the white bishop away with b5} 12. Nbd2 {developing the second knight, and I believe here that White is pretty far ahead in development} b5 {the threat, as promised...} 13. Bxd5 exd5 {now, here's where the game starts to get interesting, on account of my pawns on the 5th rank.} 14. b3 {to stop c4 chasing away the white queen. At this point, fiver posted a comment saying he hated pawns storms.} f5 {I didn't know how I could utilise my pawns at this point, so I worked towards a pawn threat on the knight (there's always the possibility of white capturing with en passant, but that'd, for me, bring out my rook into play)} 15. Nh4 {Black declines, and tries to set up a trap for me. 15...Qxd4? 16.Qxd5+ Kh8 17.Qxa8} g5 {I threaten the knight by other means instead, and at this point I have my full concerntration on this game. The pawn wall on the 5th rank is a double-edged sword for Black - on one hand, it limits the mobility of White's pieces to its side of the board. On the other hand, most of Black's major pieces are bogged down with the protection of the pawns (the black Queen, in fact, is overburdened with two pawns. But not for long...)} 16. Nhf3 g4 {continuing the threat on the knight....} 17. Nh4 {baiting me with that knight trap of his again...} Bxe5 {but I just nab the now unprotected pawn} 18. Rae1 {a challenge to the e-file} Re8 {and I return that challenge} 19. g3 {this move may not have been the best, as it weakens the White King's defence a little} f4 {offering an exchange....} 20. c4 {White finally decides to challenge those three pawns which had held their ground for so long!} fxg3 {I go for the exchange first...} 21. fxg3 {? But White captured back with the wrong pawn - this opens up the king for a powerful attack} Bb7 {Black has the bishop pair, White has the knight pair, and its clear enough here that the bishops are more powerful in this situation! Black threatens Bd4+, and White is forced to trade rook for knight (Kh1?? dxc4 mate)} 22. cxb5 {White sidesteps the danger and wins back his pawn...} Bd4+ 23. Kh1 {but White is not out of the woods yet!} Qd7 {I didn't see it until next move, but this queen move, though subtle enough, is a part of my downfall a bit later (can you see the danger?)} 24. a4 {White didn't see it either - he was obviously thinking I was about to capture the b pawn} Rxe1 {necessary exchange...} 25. Rxe1 Bf2 {! yes! The threat of mate is once again in play, and here's where I was having fantasies of showing my best game on here (well, I still consider this my best game, but I was imagining me winning)} 26. Ne4 Bxe1 {?? dammit! I played this move way too fast, and now White is gonna make a comeback! Black should have played d4 (pinning the knight), followed by Qd5, with the threat of mate in the next two move.} 27. Nf6+ {I saw this move on the screen for a full second before going to the nearest wall and giving myself a nasty lump on my head! I was so sure I was going to win this as well! (and by the way, I don't mean to sound cocky or arrogant in any way in saying this)} Kf7 {? second mistake - despite the queen loss, I still had a chance with Bf2. Kg7 and Kh8 would have both been recommended over this move, because the knight can now block my b7 bishop with Nd5+, then Nc6} 28. Nxd7 Ke6 {stopping that knight move for myself, and I was planning to resume my checkmate strategy, but...} 29. Qf5+ {damn! than other knight! now, instead of the bishop pair the knights are dominating the board} Ke7 30. Qxh7+ Kd6 {and I resign; White can move his knight and threaten capturing the knight and Qd7+, which I'm sure would lead to an eventual mate (well, there is Bc8, but White would still have a lot of checks up his sleeves) this was a very entertaining game for me, despite my mistakes! I really enjoyed it! :)}
