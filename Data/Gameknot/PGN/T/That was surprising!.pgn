1. e4 {Rather a boring opening in my opinion.} f5 {Now black is making it more interresting} 2. e5 {Nope! White doesn't like the idea of the swap} f4 {What is this? Pawn domination?} 3. d4 {It seems so} c5 {Black tries again} 4. d5 {White still doesn't agree} g5 {Ah, I think black realised that white's bishop was threatening its pawn! But was that the best idea?????!!!!!!!!!!} 5. Qh5+ {Ha Ha Ha, that was sneaky but obviously successful!!! Lucky old white!}
