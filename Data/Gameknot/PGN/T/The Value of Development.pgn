1. e3 {Hi everyone.  I know this is against a newcomer to the game, but this game is a perfect demonstration of the value of development.  I am not an advocate of memorizing hundreds of lines, but everyone should learn the funamentals of opening theory.        } e5 2. Qf3 {New players should understand that, while you're bringing the big guns out, I'll be harrassing her all over the board while I bring out the rest of my pieces.} Nf6 3. h4 {?} d5 {Gathering more space} 4. d3 Bd6 {preparing 5....Bg4 6.Qg3 e4} 5. g3 {sidestepping the trap} Bg4 {I still want to control this very important diagonal.  Notice how I have developed 3 minor pieces and completely control the center, while white has made 4 pawn moves and now 2 with his Q} 6. Qg2 e4 {When ahead in development and the oppsing K is uncastled, open it up!!} 7. dxe4 dxe4 8. b3 {This move loses material at best} Be5 {threatening 9...Qd1# & 9...Bxa1} 9. c3 Qd1# {This annotation was not meant to brag about a checkmate.  Obviously, my opponent is new to the game and still learning the ropes.  This was more of a shining example to other newcomers as to the importance of King safety and development.}
