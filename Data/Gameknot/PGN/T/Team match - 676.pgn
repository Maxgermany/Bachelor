1. e4 c5 {I never played Sicilian before, but I wanna know (in this way) if black can stop black Knights attacks.} 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 4. d3 Nf6 5. Bg5 {I saw this is a simple development of Sicilian on Games database.} Be7 6. O-O d5 {d5...} 7. Bb3 d4 8. Na3 a6 {And now i try to stop his knight} 9. Nc4 h6 10. Bh4 g5 11. Bg3 b5 {again...} 12. Na3 Nh7 {12...Nh7?! Luckily there's a reason for this. Like I said before I never played Sicilian before and at this moment i didn't know what to do. Maybe I had to move 12...g4. Anyway this is not a good move.} 13. Ne5 Bb7 14. Qh5 Nxe5 15. Bxe5 Bf6 {I defend my rook.} 16. Bxe6 {16 B:e6? Isn't this a bad move?} O-O 17. Bxf7+ Rxf7 18. Bxf6 Qxf6 {That's why!} 19. Rae1 Re8 20. c4 {In this why white wants to develop his knight, but I don't accept of course!} Bc6 21. cxb5 axb5 22. Nc2 {I don't understand. He can't move Ne3. He can move Na8 that is useless} Nf8 23. b4 {Again...} Nd7 24. bxc5 Nxc5 25. Red1 Rb8 26. Nb4 Rc8 27. Qg4 Bd7 28. Qg3 Na4 {Now i think Nb2 or Nc3} 29. Nd5 Qd8 30. f4 {He always wants to exchange pawns!} Rg7 31. f5 Nc3 32. f6 {32.f6?? Thank u rogerr!!!!!} Ne2+ {and the Q is out!} 33. Kh1 Nxg3+ 34. hxg3 Rf7 35. Rdb1 Rb8 {Now I must control the situation. } 36. a3 Be6 37. Nb4 Qd6 38. Nc2 Kh7 39. Rb4 Qxg3 40. Kg1 {He prefers move the K than capture d4.} Kg6 41. Nxd4 {Like i thought.} Rxf6 42. Rxf6+ Kxf6 43. Rb2 Bd7 {defend b pawn is very important.} 44. Rf2+ Kg6 45. Rf3 Qd6 46. Nb3 Qxa3 {victory is close...} 47. Nd4 {Nd4?? in this moment i can move 47...Qa1  and take the Knight but i don't do it.} b4 48. e5 Qa1+ {he's finished.} 49. Kh2 Qxd4 {And he resign. My first sicilian...I have to improve this defence and  i need experience. see 12... Nh7. What do u think of my moves? and his moves?. Comment, comment and comment like u always do. Bye!}
