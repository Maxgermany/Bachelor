1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 c6 {Slav defense} 4. Qc2 {Book would have been g6} e6 {transposed into a semi-slav type position} 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. a3 Be7 7. Nbd2 h6 8. Bxf6 Bxf6 {probably not the ideal capture but this temporarily makes it impossible for the white knight to occupy e5.} 9. e4 dxe4 10. Nxe4 {hitting d & f6} O-O 11. Be2 b6 {making way for the bishop, the tensions on the center and queenside are building.} 12. Rd1 Qc7 {developing the queen and removing it from the rook's file. } 13. b4 Bb7 14. c5 Rad8 {patiently waiting for the right time to exchange pawns, exchanging now would give white a very strong, possibly even winning position, note white already has a strong position.} 15. O-O Be7 {preparing Nf6 to over protect d5} 16. Bc4 Nf6 17. Ng3 Nd5 18. Rfe1 Bf6 19. Ne5 Rfe8 20. Bxd5 cxd5 {this move seems terrible at first but black has the resource of rerouting the bishop to c5, which is exactly what was done. Another note of merit is that with proper play white can deprive black of this resource.} 21. Rdc1 Bxe5 {preparing to reroute the LSB to c5.} 22. Rxe5 Ba6 {notice the queen eying the rook.} 23. h3 {I believe a5 was better, it would have allowed white to capitalize on his plan of removing the bishop.} Bc4 {now b/c black didn't play a5 on his last move he does not have the resource of a supported b5 push which would have cut the black bishop off. Incidentally, had white played a5 a move earlier black would not have played Bc5 and would have been cut out of all counter-play against white.} 24. Nf1 {rerouting the knight to take the bishop} b5 {supporting the bishop} 25. Nd2 Re7 26. a4 a6 27. Nxc4 dxc4 {dxc5 to allow the doubling of rooks on the now weak d pawn and creating a passed pawn for black as well. It's an interesting position as neither color can easily support his passers} 28. axb5 axb5 29. Qc3 Red7 {This move sets the trap of 30. Rd1, QxRe5 and play continues as in the game.} 30. Rd1 {Blunder} Qxe5 31. dxe5 Rd7xd1+ 32. Kh2 Rd8d3 33. Qc2 {I think Qb2 was more accurate, allowing white to exploit blacks vulnerable queenside which is conveniently locked away behind a wall of pawns.} Rd1d2 34. Qc1 c3 35. c6 {this move fails, there just isn't enough time.} c2 36. c7 Rc3 {White resigns in light of 37. QxR, c1=Q 38 Qd8+, Kh7 and whatever is played black is a healthy rook up in an end game. }
