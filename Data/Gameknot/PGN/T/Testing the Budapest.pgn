[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 {The Budapest. It seems a bad move (and for high standards it is), but...} 3. Bg5 {...White faced me with this for the first time! Very good! I confess I didn't know what to play. White can press me with dxe and my N is pinned, so...} exd4 4. Qxd4 {This is looking very bad for black. I don't study chess, so I don't know any theory behind this. So thank you justparanoid for your lesson!} Nc6 {I didn't like this move, since I don't want to block the c pawn, and in fact I thought strongly about c5 at once. But Qe5+ was very annoying, so I opted for this, knowing that I will be struggle against the white knight's jumps on the 5th rank. } 5. Qe3+ Qe7 {Well, I have to get out of this, and swapping queens will help me to develop the bishop f7 to e7, defending the knight. BUT white can of course play BxN, and now I have to QxQ, fxQ will leave him with weak doubled pawns. But white has Nd5... Provoking QxQ but retaking with the kinght, then o-o-o...} 6. O-O-O {Not bad, but provides me with an objective I can't expoit at the moment. I have to catch up in developement, and he just left me the chance to to that. I should have provoked it with h6, but Bf4 opens a new treat on c7, and besides Nd5 is still a possibility for white. } Qxe3+ 7. Bxe3 Ng4 {...and now, this is nastier than it seems. It threats to double white's central pawns (they are weak because black has the two bishops and the semi open column in front of them. } 8. Bf4 {White, surprisingly, has no good place for the bishop defending f2! But maybe he overlooked the threatened fork...} Nxf2 {...which is more than a fork: white can't save the h1 rook. } 9. Rd4 {On the contrary, he thinks in activating its other rook. A good idea, but overlooks...} Nxd4 {...and now the game is lost for white. Still, there are many pieces on the board, and I was playing really lightly, so I made some serious mistakes. } 10. e3 {White could have taken the c7 pawn. Black can move some pawns trying to block it, and white will lose some developement advantage, but still it left the d pawn isolated, and that is good for white.} Ne6 11. Bc4 {I should have exchanged at once the bishop. White is threatening again the exchange and Bxc7, but it is doubtful it will compensate for the loss of the bishop pair. } Nxh1 {Let's see what white does. } 12. Nf3 {Ok, so if he doesn't, I'll go for...} Bc5 {This presses a little e6. My pieces out, as quick as possible! It's incredible, but even if I am +11, I have to think on this game a little more. } 13. Nd5 {I could have defended, but hey, I wanted to see if the guy had got the idea. } Nxf4 14. Nxc7+ {Yes, he got it! :-)} Kd8 {White is forced to take a knignt or a rook, and must lose the knight. It seems that taking the rook is better, but... } 15. Nxa8 {it leaves white's knight out of the board. } Bxe3+ {Now, it starts a dangerous dance with my now free minor pieces. } 16. Kd1 Nf2+ 17. Ke1 {That's all fine, but I have my pieces tied and threatened by the white's king, even if they are untouchables by his minor pieces as well. So, what to do against g3?} Re8 {Let's add a discovered check and more power into the equation. } 18. Bxf7 {Ok, now I can simply save the rook, but I wanted something more spectacular. } Nxg2+ 19. Kf1 d6 {White has to choose among the rook or the knight. But if he takes the rook, Bh3 should be definitory. Just a bet!} 20. Kxg2 {White wants to reduce this hard minor piece block, that probably overcame several mates here and there. } Bh3+ 21. Kg3 Rf8 {Preparing a manouver to mate white. My advantage reduced from +13 to +6. But white's Na8 is doomed. } 22. Bd5 Rf6 {White's king is trapped in a few move. Can white find a way out? I don't think so, but anyway, it is nice to see how the mate net works. } 23. Bxb7 Rg6+ 24. Kh4 Rg4+ 25. Kh5 g6# {With all this pieces scattering around, the pawn is the one that gives the mate. Hope you enjoyed it, and be soon able to refute my lines!}
