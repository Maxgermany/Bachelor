1. e4 {I move my king's pawn to give his bishop and queen some freedom...} e5 {...and he does likewise...} 2. d4 {...and I move my queen's pawn to give her bishop freedom...} exd4 3. Qxd4 {...then we trade pawns, keeping with the Centre Game...} d6 {...then he moves his queen's pawn one space to free her bishop and to keep the pawn...} 4. Nf3 {...and I now bring out my knight...} Bg4 {...which is instantly attacked by his bishop...} 5. Be2 {...so I move up my bishop...} Bxf3 6.

Qe3 {...so I move her back...} Qf6 {...and he develops his queen...} 8. Nc3 {...and I bring out my knight...} O-O-O {...and he castles queenside to remove some of the protection on the castling rook's pawn...} 9. Nb5 {...so my knight targets it, as I have move control over its square (queen on e3 and knight on b5 v knight on c6)...} a6 {...forcing it to move...} 10. Na7+ {...so my knight advances to the 7th rank to fork the king and knight...} Kd7 {...but he declines to take my knight with his...} 11. Bg4+ {...so my bishop attacks...} Ke7 {...to force the king to his starting file...} 12. Nxc6+ {...so now I capture his knight...} bxc6 {...in exchange for mine, distorting his pawn structure, doubling on the c-file...} 13. Qa7 {...so my queen advances to the 7th rank to target the isolated pawn on a6, and the doubled pawns on c6 and c7...} Ke8 14. Qxc7 {...and removes the c7-pawn...} Ne7 {...forcing the knight out to cover the one on c6...} 15. O-O {...so I castle kingside to bring my kingside rook into play...} Qg6 {...and he lines my bishop up with his queen...} 16. Bf3 {...forcing my bishop to one of the only safe places, keeping it as close to the centre as possible.} Rd7 {He now attacks my queen with his rook...} 17. Qb6 {...so I retreat her slightly, attacking its pawn...} d5 {...but as he attacks my king's pawn with his queen's pawn...} 18. exd5 cxd5 {...we trade pawns, exposing our queens to each other...} 19. Qxg6 Nxg6 {...and we also trade queens...} 20. Re1+ {...so I move my rook onto the open e-file, attacking the king...} Be7 {...and he moves out his bishop to defend.} 21. Bg4 {I attack his rook...} Rc7 {...so it moves out of the way, attacking my queenside bishop's pawn...} 22. Bf5 {...which is now covered by my kingside bishop...} Nh4 {...which is now under pressure from his knight...} 23. Bd3 {...forcing it back.} Kf8 {...and he moves his king to unpin his bishop...} 24. Bxa6 {..and I now capture the isolated rook's pawn...} Bc5 {...but instead of capturing my QBP, he moves his unpinned bishop...} 25. Be3 {...so I attack it with mine...} d4 {...which is instantly pressured by his remaining queenside pawn...} 26. Bf4 {...so my bishop pressures the rook...} Ra7 {...which in turn pressures my other bishop...} 27. Bb5 {...which moves back one space to threaten a checkmate...} Ra8 {...so his rook sees to that...} 28. Re4 {...so my rook moves up to the 4th rank...} Nf5 {...and the knight moves to prevent an in-between checking move that would allow me to sacrifice my bishop for it...} 29. Rae1 {...so I double up on the e-file to again threaten a checkmate...} Be7 {...and his bishop moves in front to prevent it from happening...} 30. Bd6 {...so I attack it with mine, hoping he'll play Bxd6, so I can play Re8+, forcing him to capture, so I can recapture and mate (30... Bxd6 31. Re8+ Rxe8 32. Rxe8#)...} Nxd6 {...but I didn't see the knight attacking that square, so it captures my bishop to scupper my plan...} 31. Re4xe7 {...so I capture his remaining bishop, unaware that mine is also under attack from the knight...} Nxb5 {...and he captures my bishop, leaving me in a little disarray, as on both occasions, I failed to spot my bishops being under attack...} 32. Re1e5 {...so I move my lower rook up to attack his knight...} Nd6 {...which is forced into moving back...} 33. Rd7 {...so I pressure it again...} Nc4 34. Red5 {...and this time I double up on the d-file...} Nb6 35. Rd7d8+ {...and, with both my rooks under attack, after five consecutive knight moves by my opponent, I push my higher rook to the top rank to check, to ensure, I'll take a rook with one of mine...} Ke7 {...and he moves his king off his bottom rank, as capturing with his rook on a8 would lose both (35 ...Rxd8 36. Rxd8+ Ke7 37. Rxh8)...} 36. Rxh8 {...and I now capture the kingside rook, as it could only move in one direction...} Rxh8 {...and he captures back, letting my QRP off the hook...} 37. Rxd4 {...so I can now complete the obliteration of his queenside pawns and move my rook out of harm's way...} Rd8 {...and he contests the open d-file...} 38. Rxd8 {...so I decide to capture his rook as it was the only thing I could have really done, my eighth consecutive rook move...} Kxd8 {...and he captures mine. I felt as though I was in a 50/50 situation here, with six pawns, all still in their initial positions, only losing my central (queen's and king's) pawns, against three kingside pawns, also in their initial positions, and a knight.} 39. b3 {I move up my QNP to cover the squares on the 4th rank his knight could have moved to, to restrain it...} g5 {...and he advances his knight's pawn two spaces to cover the f4 and h4 squares...} 40. Kf1 {...so I get my king moving...} Kd7 {...and he does likewise...} 41. Ke2 Kd6 42. Kf3 Nd5 43. c4 {...and I pressure the knight with my QBP...} Nf4 {...forcing it to move to cover from its pawn...} 44. g3 {...so I pressure it with my KNP...} Nd3 {...forcing it out of the way again.} 45. a3 {I move my QRP one space to prevent a fork on c1...} Kc5 46.

Kxh6 {...but my king captures my opponent's rook's pawn...} g4 {...forcing his knight's pawn to move down for cover by the piece it started in front of.} 49. Kg7 {So my king hunts down the bishop's pawn...} f5 {...which double-steps...} 50. Kg6 {...but my king closes it down, so there's no way of saving it...} Kd4 {...so his king moves closer to my queenside pawns...} 51. Kxf5 {...and my king removes his kingside bishop's pawn.} Kc3 {His king moves behind my furthest pawn forward...} 52. c5 {...so I push it away from him...} Nd3 {...so his knight attacks it, and relinquishes control of its own pawn...} 53. Kxg4 {...allowing my king to complete the obliteration of my opponent's pawns.} Nxc5 {His knight captures my QBP...} 54. h4 {...so I advance my KRP two spaces, as it was the furthest away from his king and knight...} Nxb3 {...and I lose my QNP to the knight...} 55. h5 {...allowing my KRP to advance to the 5th rank...} Nc5 {...so the knight moves to cut it down...} 56. h6 {...so I advance my pawn to the 6th rank, four knight moves away from the knight...} Nd7 {...and as the knight advances to the d7 square...} 57. Kf5 {...I move my king, as advancing my pawn again would result in a fork: (57. h7?? Nf6!!+ 58. any king move other than Kh5 Nxh7, with my king too far away to threaten the knight). The knight is four moves away from my king, and three away from my pawn...} Nf8 {...and the knight advances to the f8 square to prevent my king from getting as close as possible to my pawn...} 58. Kf6 {...so I move him as close as possible to the knight...} Nh7+ {...and although it checks...} 59. Kg7 {...my king can now get as close as possible to my pawn, and pressure the knight at the same time.} Ng5 {The knight vacates the square...} 60. h7 {...so my pawn advances forward...} Nxh7 {...and so the knight captures it...} 61. Kxh7 {...and I capture the knight with my king, and my KNP now has a clear run.} Kb3 62. g4 Kxa3 {Although I lose my QRP...} 63. g5 Kb4 64. g6 Kc3 65. g7 Kd2 66. g8=Q {...my KNP makes it to the top rank to queen...} Ke1 {...and as my opponent's king moves onto my bottom rank...} 67. Qg2 {...my queen boxes him onto it...} Kd1 68. Kg6 Kc1 69. Kf5 Kd1 70. Ke4 Kc1 71. Kd3 Kb1 72. Kc3 {...allowing my king to close in on him. I used the conditional move to see which mated faster: moving the queen with the king until she reached d2, then moving the king, before mating with the queen v moving the king then the queen with the final move, and the latter mated faster. My opponent let this game time out as the next move would have been checkmate: 72... Ka1 73. Qb2# or 72... Kc1 73. Qc2/Qf1/Qg1/Qh1#.}
