1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It was time for a return challenge against Yoshark (Zebulun).  In my game against black I was extremely lucky to get away with a Low Draw.  Here I somehow manage to avoid getting into serious trouble.  In fact the game turns into a right old scrap.  Zebulun attacks down the h column and I attack down the c column.  For a while it seemed touch 'n go as to who would get in first.  Luckily I did.  The action starts on move 10 as nearly all the moves in this tourney up to here are standard, although black normally plays either Kc6 or Kc7 on the 8th turn.  9. ...... e6 and Qe8 have been the best moves here as the annotations so far have shown.  } c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6 10. Nc3 {10. Nc3 - development.} Na6 11. a3 {11. a3 - stops Nb4.} Bd6 12. g3 {12. g3 - backs up f4 pawn which in turn supports the knight on g5.} Nc7 13. Nf7 {13. Nf7 - I feel sufficiently developed to execute the knight fork and try and restore material equality.} Qe7 14. Nxh8 Rxh8 {14. ........ Rxh8 - I am now just 1 material point down.  I castle kingside next turn.} 15. O-O e5 16. f5 {16. f5 - trying to keep the position closed and to ensure that black's centre pawns stay doubled so that they can drop off later.} b5 17. Nxe4 {17. Nxe4 - one of the e pawns duly drops off and now points are even.} h5 18. Bf3 {18. Bf3 - eyeing up a possible discovery here.} Kb6 19. d3 {19. d3 - opening up the c1 - h6 diagonal for Fou Lenoir.} Ne8 20. Bg5 {20. Bg5 - and Fou Lenoir develops with a threat - on the Wicked Witch of the West.} Nf6 21. Rfb1 {21. Rfb1 - lining up against the BK - I now have the idea of breaking up the black pawn shield around the BK and let him have it with both cannons!} Qf8 22. Nxd6 Qxd6 {22. ...... Qxd6 - piece trade.} 23. Be3 {23. Be3 - Fou Lenoir now points at the BK.} Nd5 24. Bf2 {24. Bf2 - staying on the diagonals in the vicinity of the BK and at the same time affording Henry some much needed protection as his castled position is looking very draughty indeed.} Kc7 25. Rbd1 {25. Rd1 - I decide to line up one of my castles against the Witch.} a5 {25 ....... a5 - pawn roll, but this could be an invitation to bust that line in front of the BK - see my earlier note to move 21.} 26. c4 {26. c4 - first strike at the black wall.} Nb6 27. b3 {27. b3 - supports the c4 pawn and stops a knight incursion into a4.} Qf6 28. Be4 {28. Be4 - Fou Leblanc supports both the d and f pawns and at the same time stays on that h1 - a8 diagonal.} Qg5 {28. ....... Qg5 - oh, oh, here comes the Wicked Witch of the West, I smell an attack down the g and h columns, but I do see that although the Witch can give a couple of annoying checks, that is about all thank god.} 29. cxb5 {29. ...... cxb5 - after two days of deliberating I decide that this is the best way forward, now the breach has occurred but can I press home my attack?} h4 30. Rac1 {30. Rac1 - threat - Rxc5+ of which .........} hxg3 {30. ....... hxg3 - my opponent ignores.  Now the BK is introduced to one of my cannons - a warning shot of CHECK!} 31. Rxc5+ Kd8 32. hxg3 {32. hxg3 - after grabbing the c5 pawn I now recapture on g3 with the pawn and not Fou Lenoir.  He must stay on that g1 - a7 diagonal.} Qh5 {32. ...... Qh5 - doubles up on the h column.  I am ready for a spite check on h2.  Thanks to Fou Leblanc black cannot get Henry because h1 and g2 are covered.} 33. Rdc1 {22. Rdc1 - sidesteps the Witch's attack and doubles up on the c column.  I am eyeing up a possible skewer on c8 - if only I can dislodge that wretched knight on b6!} Qe2 {33. ....... Qe2?? - looking to cause mayhem in my position, but this is a grave error.  My Witch Ejection Plan is gonna cost Zebulun dear!} 34. Rc5c2 {34. Rc5c2 - this is a discovered attack.  The witch is attacked by a WR which is defended by another WR.  A black horse is hanging loose on b6 (LPDO everyone!) which will drop off with check next move.} Qg4 35. Bxb6+ {35. Bxb6+ - black moves his king to e7 and waves the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material after losing his knight.  He is 5 material points down and his king is gonna get chased around the board so Zebulun may well cop Old Matey if he is not careful.  Ah well, 5 points out of 8 games.  Not too bad considering my inauspicious start.} Ke7 {}
