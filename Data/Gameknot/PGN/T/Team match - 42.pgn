1. e4 e5 2. a3 {what is wrong with 2.Nf3, 2.Bc4, or 2.Nc3... hmm?} d5 {2.Nf6 is good. } 3. Nc3 {3.exd5 is better.} dxe4 {to be considered is 3.d5 displacing the N and setting a dominant center.} 4. Nxe4 Qd4 {generally, developing the Q early is really frowned upon. for good reason, White should gain tempo after tempo attacking the  Q with the minor pieces and pawns. 4.Nf6 is better.} 5. d3 f5 {5....f5 weakens the King's normal hiding place. hmmm. } 6. c3 {6.Nf3 to be considered.} Qd5 7. c4 Qd7 {7....Qd8 is very slightly better, not blocking the development of the white squared B.} 8. Nc3 Bc5 {8....Nf6 prevents Qh5+ and the loosening of the K-side with ...g6.} 9. Nf3 {9.Nf3 develop with threat. } Nc6 10. Nd5 {10.Qe2 adds to the threat of the previous move. } Nge7 11. Ng5 {11.Nc3 retreat is called for. } Nxd5 12. cxd5 Qxd5 13. f3 {13.Be3 is significantly better. 13.f3 h6 14.Nh3 f4 15.Nf2 Bxf2+ 16.Kxf2 Bf5 with strong pressure. } Be7 {13....Be7 is not a bad option, leading to a strong position. } 14. h4 h6 15. Nh3 Bxh4+ 16. Nf2 Bxf2+ 17. Kxf2 Nd4 {or ...f4 as in the previous note.} 18. f4 {I have trouble finding a better move. Qa4+, b4, White is in trouble. } Nb3 {18....Be6 adds pressure and prepares for Q-side Castling, bringing a rook to the center fray.} 19. Rb1 Nxc1 20. Rxc1 c6 21. Qe2 Qd4+ 22. Ke1 {now: 22....Qxf4 23.Qh5 Ke7 and Black is strongly ahead. safe king, more space, more pawns. }
