1. f4 {Hi everyone!  I haven't produced a game for annotation from The Annotation Project Part 2 for a long long time.  Here is another game against my buddy Steve - we seem to be quite evenly matched although he is currently leading me 7-5 at the moment.  This is one of my 3 wins against him.  One of my other two wins against him was when I was black in the Annotation Project Part 1.  The other was in the game which I annotated as Ouch! Well in this game it looked anybody's game until late on in the middlegame when it became a massacre in my favour!  We fast forward to move 9 where I decided to put Fou Lenoir on g7. } d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 Bg7 10. Ne6 {10. Ne6 - the standard cramp.  Now Glenda must hide herself on g8 for a while.} Qg8 11. d4 exd3 e.p. {11. ...... exd3 e.p.  Later on I was to try something similar against 8ballphoenix but Henry got himself into a mating net.  Luckily for me in that game, http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-annotation-project-ii?gm=28260, though my opponent merely thought he had a perpetual so I escaped with a Low Draw - had my opponent been Easy19 I would have been Freddied for sure!} 12. c3 h5 13. Bh3 b6 14. a4 a5 {14. ...... a5 - over the past few moves I have been attempting to create a Hidey Hole for Henry.  This move is to ensure that Steve does not cross my plans via the a column.} 15. g3 Kb7 {15. ...... Kb7 - voila, now if Bg2+ the c6 pawn can now block it!} 16. Be3 Na6 17. O-O h4 {17. ...... h4 - I try a pawn roll a la Freddy to break up Steve's castled position.  If I do this then look what is on the g and h columns - Glenda and a rook!  And what is sitting on g1 - Steve's king!} 18. gxh4 Rxh4 19. Bg2+ c6 {19. ...... c6 - thank heaven for little pawns!} 20. Nd4 Bxd4 21. Bxd4 {21. Bxd4 - I had no choice but to trade bishop for knight here, the c6 pawn was under fire from the bishop on g2 and that pesky knight.  At least my position looks a little less cramped.} Qh7 22. h3 {22. h3 - to stop Rxh2.} Rf8 23. Nd2 {23. Nd2 - my d3 pawn, just two squares away from Glendadom is momentarily blockaded, but he will get there.} Rhxf4 24. b4 Rf4xf1+ 25. Nxf1 {25. Nxf1 - rook trade.} axb4 26. c4 Rd8 27. Bf2 {27. Bf2 - suddenly the d3 pawn is protected.  Can Steve stop it?} Qg7 28. Rd1 Qc3 {28. ....... Qc3 - say Hello to Glenda, Steve!} 29. Ne3 d2 {29. ...... d2 - make that 1 square from Glendadom.} 30. Rb1 Qc1+ 31. Rxc1 dxc1=Q+ {31. ........ dxc1/Q+ - Glenda disappears in a puff of smoke but next move she reappears on c1 giving check and at the same time she has relieved Steve of his rook.} 32. Kh2 b3 {32. ..... b3 - what's this, another black pawn two squares away from Glendadom.  Will there be a second queen here?} 33. Nd5 cxd5 34. cxd5 b2 {34. ...... b2 - I see a discovered check but I decided to ignore it - onward to Glendadom little pawn!} 35. d6+ Ka7 36. a5 {36. a5 - I expected dxe7 here but my rook can quite happily sacrifice himself if necessary for that pawn.  With the text I can get rid of that d pawn at once.  Steve now waves the white flag.  I think, with the 7-5 lead he has over me (his wins are 5-3 in his favour, the remaining matches were draws) that Steve's rating should be in the 1800s so I was glad to get a win like this one out of him.  I just hope he gets to 1800.  I hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now, Joanne} Rxd6 {}
