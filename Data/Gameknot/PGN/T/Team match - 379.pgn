[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C88), closed, 7...O-O"]

1. e4 {I've annotated one annoying loss, so i guess I'm allowed to annotate this game, which was happier for me. I had a feeling that everything was going in the right direction straight from the opening, and that's just how it went.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {There was a time when I didn't enjoy playing the Spanish at all, but nowadays the complex closed positions feels good to play. } 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 {5...Nxe4 is the Open variation, but for some reason I don't see it that often. Maybe those who like open games play the sicilian...} 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O {Black indicates he wants to play the Marshall attack with 8...d5. I have no theoretical knowledge of that opening, but I keep hearing it's drawish in the highest level. That has nothing to do with my games, though. Why should I play like my opponent wants me to and defend for a long time? Then he would be in his element and I would be struggling.   So, from a psychological point of view, I deceided to sacrifice a pawn of my own for an attack or force a closed type of system, both of which seemed to take the attacking Marshall Attack player out of his comfort zone. } 8. d4 {So here we go.} Nxd4 {This seems better that ...exd4, because the black LSB is coming to b7 and the knight would be blocking its sight.} 9. Nxd4 exd4 10. e5 Ne8 11. c3 {And here comes the gambit!} dxc3 {Like saying "at least I'm not a coward like you!"} 12. Nxc3 Bb7 {An interesting position has arisen. Black has a pawn but White has the freer developement and potential attack on the kingside. Which is more important? White has to play with great energy and keep the initiative, otherwise black consolidates and makes his pawn count!} 13. Qh5 {I'm going to mate the king! Black can't take advantage of the posiotion of the White queen, but yet it is not sure how white will take the attack further. } g6 {Making way for the knight with tempo. Black probably didn't want to allow e6 and so refrained the basic untangling move ...d6. After the knight is on g7, the e6 square is covered and black is free to play ...d6} 14. Qh3 {This is, in my opinion, better that Qg4, as if play no continues 14...Ng7 15.Bh6 Re8?! intending ...Bf8 and ...d6 white has 16.Bxg6 Kxg6 17.Bxf7!? Kxf7 18.Qxh7 Kf8 19.Qxg6 and the threat of 20.Re3 seems to win. Even if black can repel the immediate mate, the h pawn is almost ready to run through.  } Ng7 {The logical follow-up} 15. Bh6 c5 {Black intends to cut the LSB of before playing ...d6. The immediate ...d6 again allows e6 (maybe after Rad1) with an unclear position and an attack. } 16. Rad1 {My first idea was to play 16.Bd5 and then focus on the dark squares on the kingside, because the knight would be free to move. This move, however, seemed more promising as white keeps more pieces on the board.} c4 {Rather understandable, but maybe a mistake. After Bc6 I would've been almost forced to play Bd5, with maybe a touch of an advantage for White.} 17. Rxd7 Qe8 {This is a serious error, probably due a tactical oversight. Bc8 seems indicated, but after 18. Rxd8 Bxh3 19. Rxf8+ Bxf8 20.Bxc4 White emerges a pawn up! Defending the other bishop with 17...Qc8 was interesting too, but it seems like White can always force a win of a pawn with a right timed Bxc4.} 18. Rxb7 cxb3 {Computer says this is a mistake, too, but this is the logical follow up. Fortunately, for me, there is a flaw!} 19. Rxe7 {And it's of course this. Black is completely destroyed with this move. It is remarkable how four subsequent rook moves could turn seemingly equal game into a totally winning game!} Qxe7 20. Nd5 {The double threat wins. If the queen moves, White mates in three, 21.Nf6+ Kh8 22.Bxg7+ Kxg7 23.Qxh7#} Rfe8 {Giving white a chance to blunder. 21.Nf6?? Qxf6! and it is black who wins!} 21. Nxe7+ {I played the last moves in a boring fashion, as i believe that in genuinely winning positions one should first prevent all counterplay.} Rxe7 22. Qxb3 {Simply cutting all nonsense.} Rae8 23. f4 Nf5 24. Bg5 Re7e6 25. Rd1 h6 26. Bf6 Ne7 27. Qh3 {Threatening to go for a chechmate.} Kh7 28. Rd7 Rxf6 29. exf6 Nf5 {Funny thing is that the GK computer now sees a mate in 13.} 30. Rxf7+ Kg8 31. Ra7 Re1+ 32. Kf2 Re3 33. Qxe3 {Now a mate in five, starting with Qg4. I was sure during the game that it was the quicker win, but just didn't want to allow the 1% chance that there would be some last incredible saving line.} Nxe3 34. Kxe3 {Black resigns. The only move that was criticised by the computer was 33.Qxe3 and I can't really count it as a mistake, seeing that black resigned straight after it.   I felt like this game was like jazz music, improvisation combining fluently with pieces of calculation and positional flair, resulting into a smooth attacking victory against a good opponent.   Thanks for the game, and thanks for reading! I'll be back with games that maybe are more complex!}
