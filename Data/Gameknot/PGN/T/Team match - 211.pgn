1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {King's pawn opening, three knights game. } a6 4. b3 {This move is already off the database.} Nf6 5. Bb2 Bd6 6. d4 O-O 7. dxe5 Nxe5 8. Be2 Re8 9. O-O b5 10. Nd5 Nxe4 11. Qd4 Nxf3+ {When I first saw this, before I realized the white king was in check, I thought Qxg7#.  It looked like a mistake.} 12. Bxf3 Be5 {Here at first I thought black was trading the knight for the bishop at b2.  At least the calamity Qxg7# was averted.} 13. Qxe4 Bxh2+ {But black has much bigger plans--a bishop, knight, and rook for a pawn and queen.  Sweet!  Although it is a lot of material for a queen, white's castle is demolished and his king exposed.  Well played!} 14. Kxh2 Rxe4 15. Bxe4 Qh4+ {It looks like a free bishop, but it isn't.  I think Kf8 (which only appears to expose Ph7) would have worked great.  Qh4+ could be saved for another turn, though white is almost certain to answer with Re1.} 16. Kg1 Qxe4 17. Rfe1 {Black must trade queen for rook.  Black's two extra pawns won't prove a match for white's knight.} Qxe1+ 18. Rxe1 Bb7 19. Nxc7 {Now black has one extra pawn.} Rc8 20. Re8+ {White forces a rook trade.} Rxe8 21. Nxe8 f6 {Black defends Nxg7 or Bxg7.} 22. Nd6 Bc6 23. f3 h5 24. Kf2 Kh7 25. Kg3 Kg6 26. f4 h4+ {I like f5 better, though black's position is weak.  White's king cannot move, but h5 and f5 are invisible to white's black bishop.  Black is down two points and can ill afford trades.} 27. Kxh4 Bxg2 28. f5+ Kh7 29. c4 b4 30. Bd4 g5+ 31. Kg4 Bf1 {Mm, I like Kg7 better.  Yes, white ends up with both the f6 & g5 pawns anyway, with Ne8+, Kf7, Nxf6, followed by Kxg5.  But this way white's king sits on a square invisible to white's black bishop, and white must negotiate a series of knight moves to force the king to move.  Plus black's bishop can still protect Pd7, which is preventing the promotion of white's c pawn.} 32. Bxf6 Bd3 33. Bb2 Bb1 34. a3 Ba2 35. Kxg5 bxa3 36. Bxa3 Bxb3 {Black trades two pawns for one.} 37. c5 Kg7 38. f6+ Kf8 {Mm, I like Kg8 better, I think.  White would respond with Kg6.  Black cannot promote either pawn but white can coronate the f pawn regardless.} 39. Nf5 {Now white pretty much must move Ke8, or white will move c6+ (discovered check by the bishop), Kd8...} Ke8 40. Nd4 Bg8 41. Kg6 Bd5 42. Kg7 Bc4 43. Nf5 Bb3 44. Bb4 Kd8 45. f7 Bxf7 46. Kxf7 Kc7 47. Nd4 Kd8 48. Ba5+ Kc8 49. Ke7 Kb7 50. Kxd7 Kb8 51. c6 Ka7 52. c7 Kb7 53. c8=Q+ Ka7 {Black fights for a stalemate.  While the black king gets trampled by the knight--black never throws in the towel.  It was an admirable struggle well played.} 54. Nc6# {}
