1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 {Standard starting moves in Reti's opening } Bg4 {A very aggressive stance from black - rather than amass a center my opponent thought it would be best to hinder my development. } 3. b3 {? Not a bad move by itself, but 3. e3 would have helped me more: e3, g3, Bg2, O-O and then worry abou the queenside development. } d4 {! Hinders my development and makes it very complicated for me to get a center. If 3. e3, this never would have happened. } 4. Bb2 Nc6 5. d3 e5 6. e3 dxe3 7. fxe3 Nb4 {? My opponent is fixated on achieving Nc2 - a fork, but (a) this fixation is his downfall and (b) the c6 knight was already doing good work. Nf6, Be7, Bd6 were all fine. } 8. Be2 {This move is a surrendering motion from me - again 3 e3 would have allowed me to fianchetto as normal...it's amazing how much that tiny error has haunted me.  But why not Bxe5 here? It would be better to take with the knight, but my opponent's previous move concedes material,  so why not take it?} e4 {! This could be very dangerous - a longer strategy that was king focused rather than fork obsessed may well have done me in. Again punished for a lesser move (Bxe5 would have obviously prevented this)} 9. Ne5 Bxe2 10. Qxe2 exd3 11. Qf2 Nc2+ {The promised land! Fork at last, fork at last!!} 12. Kd1 Nxa1 {???????????????????  Nf6, Qe7, and Qd7 all basically win for black - or at least create a scenario where I am forced to sac the exchange, but the fork obsession is too much to ignore.} 13. Qxf7# {}
