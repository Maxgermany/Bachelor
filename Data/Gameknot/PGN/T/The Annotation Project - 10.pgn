1. e4 {Another game from Freddy's thematic Grand Prix Attack with Q sacrifice tournament.  I'm lucky to have White in this one...  White's first elective move is on move 7.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 {The King has been chased off to the Q-side, where it is exposed to attack by White's swarm of minor pieces.  White has garnered two minor pieces for his Q but both of his extra two are as yet undeveloped, so this is his priority, even with the potential fork on f7 available.} Qe8 {Black guards against that fork anyway and increases the scope for his Q to move, thus increasing its power.  But the Black Bishop is still stuck behind the e-pawn.} 10. Nc3 {White hastens to develop, doubling the attack on e4} Nc6 11. Ncxe4 {by using the rear knight to take e4, White retains all the attacking options with the advanced knight.  With the e4 pawn gone, White can develop his B by playing the d-pawn forward without worries.} e5 {This pawn move gives B and Q space, defending the pawn on c5, but not yet preventing White from occupying e6} 12. d3 {White responds by allowing his dsb to develop, thus defending f4} h6 {finally forcing the advanced knight to move. This doesn't work out well for Black.} 13. Ne6+ {This forces the K into the open on b6, or to block in the QR} Kb6 14. c3 {prevents Black's N from going to b4 or d4} Qg6 {counter-attacking } 15. h3 {a retreat by the B to f3 or e2 would have deprived the Ne6 of defence.  A retreat to h3 would have deprived the B of the chance to move to f3 or e2 once the N's future had been secured.} h5 {Black persists in trying to force the B away but...} 16. f5 {White counter-attacks Black's Q} Qe8 17. Be2 {Now the Bishop can retreat because the N is protected and is now ready to attack the exposed king} g6 {This struck me as an irrelevance at the time but it does try to undermine the Ne6.  If White allows it to take on f5, both Ns will be attacked.} 18. Be3 {White ignores the threats mentioned in my last note to prosecute the attack on Black's K.  White has three attackers on c5 to Black's two, one of which is the poor King.} gxf5 19. Ne4xc5 {One attacked knight takes the c5 pawn, simultaneously defending the other and preparing a discovered check} Bxc5 20. Bxc5+ Ka6 21. d4+ {Perhaps Black resigned prematurely as White can still go wrong.  For example: 21...Ka5 22. b4 Ka4 23. Bd1+ Kb5 ( ...Ka3 24. b5+ Kb2 25. 0-0 Kxa1 26. Bb3+ Kb2 and White's path to victory is still not clear cut)  27. 24. Nc7+ Kc4 25. Bd2++}
