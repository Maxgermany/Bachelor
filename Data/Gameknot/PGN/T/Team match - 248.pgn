1. e4 c5 2. c4 {Unusual second move by white. I do not know this variation of the Sicilian.} Nc6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3 d6 6. h3 e6 7. g4 {Seems to be transposing to something like the Grand Prix attack.} Nge7 8. Bg2 Nd4 {Would 0-0 been better here? The text move is a little slow.} 9. Nxd4 Bxd4 10. Ne2 Bg7 11. O-O f5 {I figured it'd be better to get to f5 before white can.} 12. exf5 gxf5 13. a4 O-O 14. Ra3 {Wasn't expecting this move.} Qc7 15. Rg3 Bd7 16. b3 Bc6 17. d4 a6 18. Be3 b6 19. Nc3 {Trying to avoid opening things up too soon. I think white's pieces would be better setup to handle an open game.} Rae8 20. d5 exd5 21. Nxd5 Nxd5 22. Bxd5+ Kh8 23. Bxc6 Qxc6 24. Kh2 Qe4 25. Qxd6 Qc2+ {I thought I would be able to get the backward pawn back. But it appears that I have too many issues with king safety.} 26. Rf2 Qxb3 27. Bd4 Qxc4 28. Bxg7+ Kxg7 29. gxf5+ Kh8 30. Qxb6 Rxf5 31. Rg4 Qd4 32. Qb2 {Things are looking drawish, so long as neither side missteps.} h5 33. Rg5 Ref8 34. Kg3 Kh7 35. Rxf5 Rxf5 36. Qb7+ Kg6 37. Qxa6+ Rf6 38. Qc8 Qxa4 39. Qxc5 Qd1 40. f5+ Kf7 41. Qc7+ Kf8 42. Qf4 Qd6 {I'm hoping to get to a position without the queens that resembles diagram 352 in Basic Chess Endings by Fine. In that example, White R on e6, pawns on f4 and h3 and K on h4. Black R on g8 and K on g7 ended in a draw.} 43. Qxd6+ Rxd6 44. Kh4 Kg7 45. Kxh5 Rh6+ 46. Kg4 Ra6 47. Kg5 Ra1 48. h4 Rg1+ 49. Kh5 Kf6 50. Kh6 Rg8 51. Kh7 Rg7+ 52. Kh6 Rg8 53. Kh5 Rg7 54. Rf4 Rg8 55. Rf1 Rg7 56. Rf4 {}
