[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {Ruy Lopez} 4. Nc3 {Swiftly turning to a Four Knights game. Solid on both sides.} Bb4 5. O-O Bxc3 {Black chooses the Bishop for Knight exchange, doubling whites c pawn. However, ultimately, will this diminish his development?} 6. dxc3 {The dxc3 option, rather than bxc3 opens the file for white's Queen.} Nxe4 {Currently, it seems black has stronger position however, and gains a pawn.} 7. Be3 a6 {The late defense of the Ruy Lopez opening may have opened black up a bit more than he wished.} 8. Ba4 d6 {Also a late move, perhaps would have been stronger played earlier, say 6.. d6. However, black retains material advantage, but at what cost?} 9. Qd5 {The Queen steps forth. Many may assume this is far too early to bring the Queen into play, however since it forces black to defend the e4 Knight, and gives white the opportunity to open up black's Queenside, it is indeed a strong move.} Nf6 10. Bxc6+ bxc6 11. Qxc6+ {And white regains the gambit pawn, with distinct positional advantage.} Bd7 {A solid defence (though forced) attacks white's Queen, while protecting the queenside Rook.} 12. Qc4 {And time is ripe to pressure f7...} O-O 13. Nh4 {The obvious Kingside castle gives white an extra developmental move as middle-game gets into it's stride.} d5 {White's Queen is always going to be under pressure, and there is a danger it's early development role will negate the extra moves he has gained.} 14. Qb3 Be6 {Black is coming to the fore with clear strength of strategy. He understands the vulnerability of white's Queen, and while he himself develops, white is forced again to adjust his Queen's position...} 15. Qb7 Rb8 {It may be that black is almost too focussed on attacking white's Queen to notice that White has a strategy of his own...} 16. Qxa6 Rxb2 17. Bc5 {White places black firmly back on the back foot.} Re8 18. Qe2 e4 19. Bd4 {This is where white's early development and attack of black's queenside becomes obvious. Though he has doubled pawns, this may work to white's advantage.} c5 20. Bxc5 {And the result is white gains a pawn.} Bg4 {Black renews focus on white's Queen, as both players at this stage consider endgame strategy, in what turns out to be a cat-and-mouse dogfight!} 21. Qe3 Rxc2 {Black regains the lost pawn, however perhaps white considered this pawn already lost?} 22. Bb6 {And it is time for white to start attacking black's Queen!} Qc8 {Black then shows the maturity of his strategic play, forcing white to defend his c pawn.} 23. Bd4 Qd8 {White's choice to play back and forth allows him to make his next move from an alternative position with black having effectively "lost" a move.} 24. a4 {Advancing the pawn is the "free" move.} Nh5 25. g3 {This is a further move from white that may raise some eyebrows. It is indeed extremely risky to expose the castled area in this manner, however this will ultimately prove decisive as endgame approaches.} Re2 26. Qc1 Qc8 27. Qg5 {Again, white's back-and-forth attitude adds a little bit of depth to his position.} g6 {Forced to defend his Knight, black has inadvertently opened up the black diagonal. Something which white will be keen to capitalize on.} 28. Qxd5 {Pins the f7 pawn.} Bh3 {This is clearly the beginning of endgame, and both players are focussing all their efforts on trying to gain a little advantage when both are so evenly and tightly matched.} 29. Rfe1 Qg4 30. Rxe2 {Exchanges the rooks. This is extremely risky, but it appears white has it covered, since he can prevent any resulting mate because of his Knight's position on h4, and ability to block g2.} Qxe2 31. Ng2 h6 {Black is turning the screw, however the game is so tight, it remains to be seen can he mate on time.} 32. Re1 {An intelligent white move forces black's Queen back to g4 (via f3 - the hope of an early mate), allowing his Knight to return to h4 and set a trap.} Qf3 33. Nh4 Qg4 34. Be3 {There is a need to prevent black from advancing his e pawn further, however white's strategy to mount a counter-attack on black is subtly developing.} g5 35. Qc6 {Clever move to drag the Rook out of position, however leaving the defensive h4 Knight open for the taking could be a problem? Or the key to spring the trap?} Rc8 36. Qxh6 gxh4 {The trap is sprung. While black focussed so closely on his own strategy, and seemingly invincible endgame, white will counter in a make-or-break attempt to either mate or blow up the entire structure of the game.} 37. Bd4 Qf3 {Sucked into the trap of the Knight sacrifice, black moves in for the kill, unwittingly having missed the inevitable mate against himself.} 38. Qh8# {An incredibly tight game, not without errors, but stylish and fun to watch.}
