[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {White starts with the Queen's Pawn Opening. This is the most common move leading to the Stonewall Attack. Other's include the 'Closed Blocker': 1. e3 and the Bird's Opening: 1. f4. A last one which is now often seen is 1. Nc3 or 1. Nf3. All these possibilities all lead to the same attack, but the extremely common ones are 1. d4 and 1. Nc3.} d5 {After 1. d4 I usually open up with 1. ... Nf6 stopping 2. e4 or 1. ... e6 trying to open a line for my DSB. This is known as the 'Closed Blocker with Colours Reversed' or, as in an example after 1. e4 e6 it is then named after the foul but fabulous French, 'The French Defence'. But this serious but relaxing move: 1. ... d5 mentions key features of the Queen's Pawn Game.} 2. e3 {Strictly speaking, White makes this text move because he is trying to steer the play into the Pawn Pattern which he has observed, and with which you will become familiar. From a theoretical point of view, White's move has certain advantages and certain disadvantages. Thus, White will now be able to develop his LSB. This is a factor of the greatest importance, as the bishop will play a big role in White's coming plans. True, e3 blocks white's DSB but that does not matter yet, at this point. } Nf6 {This is an excellent developing move which has the merit of controlling e4 and preparing for castling. Also, this secures Black's position before he comfortably counter-attacks/attacks. Also, if the greatest move 3. f4?! is played, then Black can reply with the miraculous 3. ... Ne4! establishing a strong outpost in the centre. } 3. Bd3 {! This is one of the key moves in White's development. The Bishop move prepares for castling, sets up the bishop on a strong diagonal, and disputes many glisters of control on the vital square: e4. In addition, it also stops 4. ... Ne4?! after 4. f4! without risking doubled pawns for Black. Plus, when Black has castled, the bishop will also be eyeing the h7 pawn and the f5 square.} e6 {Black follows suit, preparing for his development of his DSB (main bishop). Black also makes this text move because he is trying to build a critical pawn structure and defend easily, also counter-attacking on the queenside. This move, as seen with White's 2. e3 also has certain advantages and also certain disadvantages, including the blockade of his LSB but the strong a3-f8 diagonal suited for his DSB.} 4. Nd2 {White intends to play 5. e4 which is one of the characteristic moves of his Pawn Pattern. Once 5. e4 has been played, Black can consequently bring out his other knight without causing much danger to White's adequate position.} c5 {! A good move theoretically, as it engages d-pawn and thus minimizes somewhat White's pressure on e5. Of course White would not dream of playing 5. dxc5? as that would relax his grip of the valuable square e5, and this allows Black to develop another piece, after 5. ... Bxc5.} 5. c3 {! White supports the d-pawn and also retreats for the LSB along the powerful diagonal.} Nc6 {Black aims to develop his knight and faintly press on the e5 square and somewhat threatens to play 6. ... e5!! or 6. ... Be7! and finally, the light 6. ... Bd7!? This forces White to play 6. f4! which prevents Black from playing the vital 6. ... e5!!  and launches the unique Stonewall Pawn Structure. Note that 6. ... c4? would have released the grip on the tight pawn chains of White's personalized structure, delete his faint but solid attack on the queenside, and after that, White can still play 7. Bc2! without any catastrophes or any major disruptions. Plus, it would still be controlling the b1-h5 diagonal, which is a very important piece of the board for White's attack (The Stonewall Attack).  } 6. f4 {! This move completes the Stonewall pawn pattern (although maybe rots the kingside). Now we have 6. ... e5  permanently prevented, and White prepares to anchor his King Knight at a powerful outpost following 7. Ngf3! Also, White keeps the majority of his pawns on Black squares, where his LSB will be extremely powerful (not to mention his useless DSB). Now we begin to see how the Stonewall Pattern got its name!} Be7 {Black continues developing and prepares for castling. Notice how 6. ... Bd6?! encounters the danger of a pawn fork on e5, when a pawn reaches e4/e5.} 7. Ngf3 {! White immediately increases pressure near Black's Kingside. This is the reason why Black played 6. ... Be7! which indirectly defends Black's Kingside when the knight on f6 has moved. Another option would have been to 'fianchetto' Black's DSB but it would take an extra developing move in the opening, although the positive fact is that it would have given his Kingside extra protection. } O-O {Black gets his King into safety so he hopes-and looks forward to completing his development on the Queenside with 8. ... Bd7!? or 8. b6!? However, Black needs to huddle up quickly, as White's attack is preparing to be launched!} 8. Ne5 {!! White has now achieved his opening objectives: He has set up the Stonewall Pawn pattern, which gives him a firm grip on the centre; he has posted his LSB at d3 with strong attacking prospects, and he has brought his King Knight to e5 emphasizing his grip on the centre.} Qc7 {!? Black intends to "fianchetto" his LSB. Before he can do this, however, he must give his Queen Knight additional protection.} 9. O-O {! While automatically removing his King to safety, White enhances the force of coming attack by bring his King Rook into action. White has shown good sense in adding the King Rook to his attacking forces before embarking on an offensive.  } b6 {!? Black is looking forward to play 10. ... Bb7!? which is not very useful at this moment (until later on), because White is strongly developing and attacking, and Black needs to think about defending himself, and not concerning too much on developing Queenside pieces in two/three moves. 9. ... Bd7 is still fairly OK and comfortable, and even after 10. ... Bd7!? White would not even think about playing 11. Nxd7? as Black would relax after 11. ... Qxd7. Note that after 10. ... Bd7!? 11. Nxd7? Nxd7?! would leave Black's valuable h7 pawn undefended. Still, after 10. ... Bd7!? 11. Nxd7? White would have an uncomfortable time strengthening his grip on the centre and attack. } 10. g4 {!? White's violent thrust of the King Knight pawn is made with several objectives in mind. His basic idea is to drive away black's king knight, so his Bishop can be freely attacking h7. The downside is that White's kingside is also weakened, but at the moment the Black Queen must wait until it can make use of the h2-b8 diagonal, and the Bishop on e7 needs a tempo to reach h4 where it will dominate a specific but extremely fierce attack when the Black Queen gets to a place like h3, where it is safe and provides a powerful attack for Black. If Black's LSB reaches h3, his DSB reaching h4 and his queen dominating the g-file from a safe distance, and possibly a knight placed on g4 or f3, White would be in big trouble! But all this can and must wait.} Bb7 {! Now Black actually threatens to play 11. ... Nxe5! But why? Now the claim is made that NxN would be good. Yes, I have explained that, but the question is, why now, and not before?  The point is, that after 11. ... Nxe5! 12. fxe5 Black would be able (after 10 ... Bb7) to play 12...Ne4!! establishing and maintaining an outpost of his own. White's attacking plans would be disrupted, which means that his structure will weaken.} 11. Qf3 {!! Now black's plan if foiled, and why? If black plays 11. ... Nxe5?! 12 fxe5! Ne4? 13. Nxe4 dxe4 14. Bxe4 and Black has lost a valuable Pawn (and probably his 'subordinate Dragon Bishop' on b7) without compensation.} a6 {?! A strange-looking move; how does it enhance Black's prospects? Is Black marking time? Is he waiting to see how White's plan carefully unfolds? Has he got a plan of defence or counterattack of his own? Perhaps he will play 12. ... b5?! or maybe he is just waiting for White to make a silly mistake? Maybe his Rooks will get developed next after 12. ... Rfe8 or 12. Rad8 then? Or maybe is it that after 12. ... b5?! he will play 13. ... c4!? Maybe 11. a6?! was just to give the b5 square and the f1-a6 diagonal extra additional protection that was not necessarily needed? Isn't it amazing how many extraordinary but weird thoughts come up in your head when you are battling through Chess. Whose fault? Yours? No, but you have just got to cope with it.} 12. g5 {! The key move. A moment ago we said that 12. ... Ne4 was bad, so where can the knight move to? Is it a valuable square where Black can safely counterattack, threatening to move a key piece of white's, for example, d7? Or is it just a silly square like e8? A blundered square like e4? Or a vital destruction of White's property, a safe counterattack, like 12. ... Nxe5? Or is Black just willing to sacrifice his knight for a positional advantage like the dubious 12. ... b5?! 13. gxf6 Bxf6 14. Qh5 h6!? 15. Rd3 b4?!} Ne8 {? Ne8 has several disadvantages, one of which it bocks Black's rook on f8 from coming into the game. Plus, White could be threatening mate at any time on h7! Personally, I find this move quite hilarious! Knights on the rim are dim! Well, this knight has only got one safe square to go to. Certainly dim! As I said, I find this move quite hilarious with no major positive opinions for this absurd novice-like move. I would personally play 12. ... Nd7! threatening to swap off White's precious knight on e5. However, this knight move has a special disadvantage, as you will find out on the next great move.} 13. Bxh7+ {!! There is no humour in this move! This sacrifice is the logical outcome of the Bishop's menacing position on the diagonal. Black's dominant casted position now becomes so vulnerable that his king may be exposed to a mating attack!} Kxh7 {13. ... Kh8 would be even worse, as it fails to a carefully woven and prepared discovered check after 14. Qh3/Qh5 and his valuable h7 pawn would've been lost without any material or positional gain. Now, Black's structure is completely foiled, even though white is a very unfortunate two points down.} 14. Qh5+ {This vital check forces Black's king to move back to g8, where White can plan to arrange other attacks by feeding in more pieces.} Kg8 {Now that the valuable h7 pawn has vanished, the Black King is very vulnerable to mating attacks when the Rooks join in after 15. Rf3! } 15. Rf3 {! Note how White's forces are taking up the moves carefully woven in his original attacking plan. Now his idea is 16. Rh3 threatening 17. Qh7# or 17. Qh8# which are both mate.} g6 {This still offers some fight, whereas after something else (i.e. 15. ... Rd8) White can play 16. g6! and mate follows at once.} 16. Qh6 {This move keeps the detailed and knitted structure of the strong attack of Rh3 and the follow-up of checkmate. 16. Qh4?! is dubious as this disables the advance of the g5 pawn once the second-to-last vulnerable g6 pawn has vanished. Black would also be willing to equal the material by playing 16. ... Bxg5?! anytime.} Ng7 {Valiantly trying to shield his King and get one piece into defence, whereas more White pieces can join into attack. This is why the g6 pawn advanced, to let a little hole fit for the knight on g7. As I said, if a Dragon Bishop was located on g7 instead of the knight, then White's queen would've been unable to settle on the fearsome h6 square. } 17. Rh3 {! This move bursts the smoothie. It causes an earthquake! Now, White has three pieces in attack: The Queen and Rook lined up on the h-file, and the knight greatly posted on the strong outpost of e5! Thus, Mate in 1 follows at once unless Black plays the almost-quite safe and almost-quite secure move which results in a confusion moment for White, but what is it? What is this particular saving move for Black, then?  } Nh5 {! Now black's plan becomes clear. His knight blocks the all-important h-file, preventing the execution of White's mating threat. White is a piece behind, so he cannot afford to give up now. Another sacrifice is called for! Another fighting period! Another winning move! Another hint of no-giving up for a wide crunch of clear purposes. And, what is this specific but brilliant move of heaven?} 18. Nxg6 {!! Breaking Black's position wide open. The availability of the knight for this sacrifice is a tribute to the power of this piece on the dominating square e5! The threat of19. Qh8# is to be met again and black is left with no choice but with the subtle and regretful 18. ... fxg6.} fxg6 {Black can now relax (for the moment) but his kingside is in parts. How is he going to manage? But how is White going to manage? He can win a second pawn back after this knight sacrifice, but he will still be three points down, so in other words, how is he going to continue this menacing and vicious attack? } 19. Qxg6+ {This is the obvious move, even for Grandmasters. Unhinging the support of Black's Knight at h5 is an important factor of the Stonewall Attack, yet we can now see that Black's knight is lost due to a fork, and with it, the game. But all is not easy for Grandmasters! They have a back-up survival move in their minds. The answer is that Black must interpose with his knight (19. ... Ng7), whereas if you don't think twice about it with 19. ... Kh8? follows with 20. Rxh5# checkmate.} Ng7 {Here we have a tense moment. A knight and bishop for three pawns in an non-understandable piece of information and exchanges. So, White has to earn back a piece in this game from now. But as White is 3 points down, it looks like his hopes are all gone! So how is he going to exert extra pressure on Black's king and push forward the strong attack?} 20. Rh7 {The Rook is made nearer to Black's king and threatens 21. Qxg7#. Black needs to clear the rank so he can defend the knight with his queen by moving the Bishop but still, things will be tough for him. If a Bishop gets himself to h6 (and it will), then Black's dreams are doomed. The lost piece won't matter, since all the others will be cheering for happiness. But, again, this can still be delayed. There is no need for this to be immediate. So, good plan, but how is this to be acted out? How is the heart of this game to be linked in with the danger and pressure near Black's vulnerable King and his poor defending knight, and not to forget, his naughty Rook on f8, taking up all his space?} Bd6 {! This saves the day for the moment, as it enables the Queen to protect the all-important knight on g7 through the rank, for the minute only. It is possible that White can see the light to enable him to return material and possibly win the game. This would be ideal for him, but this is only for starters. What's the move for the main? } 21. Qh6 {With Black's kingside position perforated, White has no trouble thinking up new ways of keeping Black's King entirely miserable. This threatens 22. Rh8+ Kf7 23. Qf6+ Ke8 (23. g6+ Ke8 (23. ... Kf6 24. Qg5#) 24. Rxg7 is not enough) 24. Rxf8+ Kd7 (this is now harmful for Black but it hasn't yet finished) 25. Qxg7+ Be7 26. Rxa8 Bxa8 but this is not enough. How can White mate instead of a sufficient material advantage?} Bxf4 {! Pinning White's g5 pawn and thus preventing 22. g6 (allows 22. ... Bxh6!), at least for a moment. This is a nice plan, but it involves a major sacrifice of material, which returns pieces back to White. Still, his game will extend by a couple of moves, which is still an advantage.} 22. exf4 {Now the threat of g6 has to be met again, with no Black bishop pinning the g5 pawn.} Rxf4 {Black has disrupted white's pawn structure, but White has more attacking plans to go!} 23. g6 {Now white is threatening mate on the move! (25. Rh8#) White is also threatening the rook too! How is Black going to cope? (23. ... Kf8 is a disaster following 24. Rh8+ Ke7 25. Qxg7+ Kd6 resulting in a midmist of distruption).} Rg4+ {Now, that is the one and only way to stop mate. 24. Kh1 Rxg6 25. Qxg6 loses a whole range of material for Black, but that sure stops White's mating threat!} 24. Kh1 {White's king hides in the corner. 24. Kf1 is a mistake because black would play 24 ... Qf4+! threatening an exchange of White's powerful queen against Black's weak queen. 24. Kf2 would fail to the exchange as well. } Rxg6 {And as I said, this is the only way to stop mate, though it allows a sacrifice of a Rook, only gaining a vital pawn. Still, what is more important, the game, or just a poor and shaggy old good-for-nothing chariot?} 25. Qxg6 {White is now the exchange ahead and his pressure remains unabated (he's two points up now). In one sense, it is even stronger than before, now that White's DSB is ready to take a hand in the proceedings.} Rf8 {Black brings the other Rook in to defence, which mightily spoils White's attacking plans, for the least of time in the history of the universe.  } 26. Nf3 {There are other winning methods, but this is certainly the most pleasing. Sacrificing a poor knight in return for a particular winning game is common, in other openings, but certainly in 'The Stonewall Attack'.} Rxf3 {This is mostly usual, but White's DSB will soon be out. Black has now faced with mating threats after 27. Bg6!} 27. Bh6 {! Setting up a murderous pin. He threatens mate by beginning with RxN+ setting up a tactic called 'The See-Saw' and 'The Guillotine' combined. More like 'The Guillotine See-Saw'!} Rf7 {Black spots the only defence. But now white strengthens the pin.} 28. Rg1 {!! Most impressing, as black cannot do anything about this mate. Everything is struggles for Black here and White is actually down by one point! The moral is that the latter is more important, as Black has a terrible position, while White still has a 'Knock before entering' sign on his door with his only guard, the h2-pawn, snoozing by the gate (the g1-rook). An activity for you to do is to analyse this position. See what saving and winning moves are in your hands.} Nxd4 {?? This doesn't help. Better was 28. Ne5 sacrificing itself, but still attacking the queen. } 29. Bxg7 {This is now typical for Black! The bishop attacks the knight and threatens mate on the move (30. Rh8#). Black must capture with his Rook, or else the game is immediately lost on move 30. This lost game for Black is disastrous now, and there are no saving moves. It is either mate, or a severe material disruption.} Rxg7 {?! This is a best try, but it loses the queen and more or less the game. A rook goes, and more or less, the queen and the game. First follows with 30. Rxg7+} 30. Rxg7+ {This wins the queen, and the game. Black resigned here, seeing that there was no opportunity for Black to win or even draw. After the queen loss for nothing (30. ... Qxg7?? 31. Qxg7#), his game will be sacrificed.  I hope you have enjoyed my annotation.
