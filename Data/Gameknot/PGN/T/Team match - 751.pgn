1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {it is highly popular to play that version these days. I dont like it very much (as white).} g6 4. d3 Bg7 5. Be3 b6 {I think d6 is a bit better...} 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nf6 8. h3 {8. Nxc6 dxc6 9. Qxd8  Kxd8 10. Nd2 is a worth looking endgame for white.} Nxe4 9. Nxc6 dxc6 10. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {by playing 8. h3 white got the same ending I wrote last note but with one pawn down.} 11. Nd2 Nxd2 12. Bxd2 Kc7 13. Bc4 f5 {black should keep his advantage. in general, exchanging the rooks and keeping the bishops is good for black. exchanging bishops too is great for black.} 14. O-O-O e5 15. f3 a5 16. b3 b5 {black is kicking white out from the board. the extra pawn is realy shown...} 17. Be2 a4 18. b4 Be6 19. Kb1 Rhd8 {the rook is entering the game.} 20. Be3 {white helps black to prove he is better by changing the rooks.} Rxd1+ 21. Rxd1 h6 {R d8 is better in order to exchange all pieces.} 22. Bc5 Bd5 23. Rc1 e4 24. c4 {why would white do that. if white wants a chance to draw the game he must change bishops from the opposite color, not the same...} bxc4 25. Bxc4 Bxc4 26. Rxc4 exf3 27. gxf3 Rb8 28. Rc2 Bd4 {! a very nice move.} 29. Be7 Kd7 30. Rc4 {?? black's 31st move will prove that was a mistake.} Kxe7 31. Rxd4 c5 32. Rc4 Rxb4+ 33. Rxb4 cxb4 {black is won...} 34. Kc2 Kd6 35. Kd3 Kc5 36. h4 g5 37. hxg5 hxg5 38. Kc2 Kd4 39. Kd2 b3 40. axb3 axb3 41. Kc1 Kc3 {the end...}
