1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Be6 4. Bxe6 fxe6 5. O-O Nc6 6. d3 Be7 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Bg5 Nd4 {Moving in for the attack... planning to do Nxf3 and open the g-column to an attack on the king.} 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Ne2 {I think instead of this move, White should have instead done Nxd4, or maybe left that space open so the queen could protect the knight on f. White makes the first mistake here.} Nxf3+ 11. Kh1 {White doesn't take my bait and instead moves the king... something I would have done, as well.} Nd4 {Planning to exchange knights... now that I have the advantage, I'm going to just get rid of as many of White's pieces as possible.} 12. Nxd4 exd4 {Exchange of knights} 13. c4 dxc3 e.p. {Exchange of pawns} 14. bxc3 Bxc3 {Taking the unguarded pawn} 15. Qg4 {White seems to be threatening to do Qxe6+, but I want that Rook.} Bxa1 {Taking the rook} 16. Rxa1 {White takes my bishop} e5 {Moving the pawn} 17. Qxg7 {White takes my other unguarded pawn} Rf8 {The only move that wouldn't have lost me my rook.} 18. f3 {Protecting the f-pawn} Qf6 {Hoping that White will do a queen exchange so I can begin working on a back-rank mate.} 19. Qxc7 {Taking my unguarded pawn} Qe7 {Still trying to get the queen} 20. Qc4 Qf7 21. Qb4 Rc8 {At this point, I decide to try for a back-rank mate anyway.} 22. Qxd6 {Another unguarded pawn} Qc7 {Preparing to do Qc1+ to force a mate. At this point, if I were White, I would have done Qa3 to increase my defenses on the back rank} 23. Qxe5+ {White makes a crucial error, letting me take the Queen. } Qxe5 {White resigns. }
