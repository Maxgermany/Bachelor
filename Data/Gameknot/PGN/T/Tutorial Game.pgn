1. d3 {An unassuming beginning - almost shy - but it is also non-committal and flexible.  Nothing wrong with this.} e6 {Equally cagey.  Black frees diagonals for Q and B to develop.} 2. Nf3 {Good development.} Bc5 {Brings the bishop to a 'natural' square, eyeing f2,  Not that f2 is in any danger yet, but White could poke the bishop in the eye with 3.d4, forcing it to move again.  White would not need to worry about 3...Bb4ch as 4.c3 to block the check would be good and solid.} 3. e3 {Creating a 'small centre'.  Blocks the bishop's line to f2, and frees the King's bishop to develop to e2, if White so wishes.  I prefer 3.d4, but this is fine.} Qf6 {Suddenly Black shows ambition!  She hasn't given up hope that an opportunity might yet develop against f2, and there is also a chance that something interesting might appear on b2.  Ironically, Black was later to overlook a very real chance at f2, and the b2-square ought to have proved fatal for her.  You'll just have to wait and see...  But seriously, Black would have been better off (objectively speaking) developing a knight to f6 instead.} 4. Be2 {OK: consistent.} d5 {Staking a bigger claim on the centre.  Good play.  Having set up the Q-B lines against f2, Black doesn't press the matter, but reverts to developing sensibly.  Note that Black had plenty of good moves available: ...d5 was one of them.} 5. Bd2 {Now, I doubt White had seen through the implications of this development; but if she did, it was very clever of her.  Now the b2-pawn is left unprotected, and Black might well have said to herself: 'Ooo, yummy: free pawn!" and played 5...Qxb2, with the tasty prospect of winning the a1-rook. fen="rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/2bp4/8/3PPN2/PqPBBPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -" But White would have had a counter-attack ready: 6.Bc3!! ... The bishop attacks the queen and THROUGH THE QUEEN protected the rook.  After 6...Qb6, say, then comes 7.Bxg7 ... and 8.Bxh8 and it is White who wins a rook.  In fact, Black would probably be better off exchanging Queen for Rook and hope to save the game.  To recap: 5...Qxb2?? 6.Bc3 Qxa1 7.Bxa1 ... and White is the major exchange ahead.  Not for nothing is the b2-pawn called the 'poisoned pawn'!} d4 {Rightly passing up the b2-bait.  But this move isn't very good either.  Although it has as many defenders (bishop and queen) as White has attackers against it (pawn and knight), that pawn is not safe at all.  Black would have been much better advised to move one of her undeveloped minor pieces.} 6. exd4 {Well played!  White wins a pawn.  Perfectly OK and safe would have been 6.e4, but in my view this capture is best.  See next note.} Bb6 {Quite rightly Black leaves the d-pawn strictly alone.  Had she recaptured, a bit of a melee might have developed: 6...Bxd4 7.Nxd4 Qxd4 8.Bc3! ... (attacking the queen, and through the queen {this is called a skewer} attacks the g7-pawn {and the h8-rook behind it} as well.  Black has but one good move to deal with this;) 8...Qd5! (Now, if White plays 9.Bxg7, Black goes 9...Qxg2! attacking White's rook and g7-bishop both.  White COULD press on with this line, but would probably be better to cut out here, BEFORE Black gets to play ...Qxg2:) 9.Bf3! Qg4 (Guards g7) 10.h4 Qg6 with a fine game for White. fen="rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/4p1q1/8/7P/2BP1B2/PPP2PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq -"} 7. Nc3 {Developing the last minor piece.  White is doing great, here: development almost complete, well centralised, solid position, a pawn ahead.  Could it be objected that Black could now snitch the d-pawn?  Actually no: 7...Bxd4 8.Ne4! -  By attacking the bishop's sole protector, the knight drives away the queen, leaving the bishop to be taken for nothing.  Black's best option then would be to 'sell' the bishop for what it will fetch: 8...Bxf2ch 9.Kxf2 - and Black then has time to save the queen.} e5 {Not a good move, as Black should lose a second pawn for nothing.  Possibly Black is trying to open the lines against f2.  } 8. dxe5 {The better capture, as after 8.Nxe5 Bxd4 9.Nf3 ... White remains just one pawn ahead.  Now White is two pawns to the good, has a powerful centre, and Black is forced to spend time attending to her queen.} Qc6 9. Ng5 {This is where White starts to go wrong, I think.  It is understandable that with development complete, White wants to set up a plan.  Did she have a trap in mind? 9...Qxg2(??) 10.Bf3, winning the Queen?  It doesn't work, for then comes 10...Qxf2  Checkmate!   I think I would have preferred to castle or play 9.d4.  So this knight move looks like a mistake. } Qc5 {Threatens checkmate, but, much stronger would have been 9...Qxg2, attacking the rook on h1 and threatening mate on f2.  White's only defence would have been 10.Rf1, saving the rook and defending f2.  Fortunately the g5-knight is defended already.  But Black would have equalised the game.} 10. Na4 {??  I can see the idea here - and the motif (attacking Q and B lined up in this way) is a very familiar one.  But White has overlooked something terminal - 10...Qxf2#!  Much, much stronger would have been simply to castle, and if Black were to take the e-pawn (10.0-0 Qxe5), White has a tremendous tactical shot: 11.Bg4!!  It has to be admitted, this one's a bit more arcane, but leaving that aside, White would be well on top.  The simpler 11.Re1 comes more easily to mind, would be almost as strong, with nasty threats down the e-file.} Qd5 {Having set up the checkmate - at such great risk, too - why did Black not play it? 10...Qxf2#. No further comment needed here! } 11. Bf3 {OK, but the simplest would have been to end all further threats against f2 by 11.Nxb6.  Castling was a very good alternative.} Qxe5+ {This is very annoying for White, not so much the loss of the pawn (that has compensations in the open e-file), but the check is a real nuisance.  It is hard to know how best to deal with it.  Probably best is 11.Kf1, but who would think of that?  Offering the exchange of queens is also unattractive in the circumstances, but is probably the second best move!  Moving the bishop back to e2 hardly comes into consideration, as it has just moved away from there.  So we are left with interposing on e4.  And THAT has problems of its own as we will discover.} 12. Ne4 {Understandable, but this (and Be4 would have suffered the same) has a  downside.  The knight is left pinned, the bad part being that Black has ...f5, attacking the immobilised knight.  This would be far from fatal, though, as White has such a lead in development, she could probably sustain the loss and still have an advantage.  See next note.} Qb5 {Disdaining to attack the pinned knight by 12...f5.  What might have happened, then?  The knight would certainly have been lost, but not without compensation: 12...f5 13.Bc3 ... (Counter-attacking the Queen, and eyeing g7, as well.  Instead, castling {13.0-0} would have been pretty good as well) 13...Qe7 (Keeps the pin on the knight, and protects g7 as well.) 14.0-0 fxe4 (Well, there goes the knight, but 15.Re1! ... And now White pins the e-pawn against the Black royal family!  Were Black to try and defend by 15...Bf5, fen="rn2k1nr/ppp1q1pp/1b6/5b2/N3p3/2BP1B2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -", 16.Bxe4!! would be deadly (better than taking with the pawn, as White wants the e-file open for her rooks).} 13. Nac3 {Reasonable, again, but it does leave the b2-pawn open to capture.  As it happens, this is OK, but only if you can figure WHY its OK.  I might well have played 13.Nxb6 here as the simplest idea.  But there was a good alternative in 13.c4, attacking the queen, at the same time protecting the knight with White's own queen.  This is an easily overlooked motif to defend a knight on a4 (or, in Black's case, a knight on a5).  } Qb4 {I have to admit, I can't figure what Black had in mind for this move.  What might have happened had she taken the b-pawn?  Well, White's simplest course would be to chase the Queen out with Rb1 (13...Qxb2, 14.Rb1  Qa3 15.0-0), with a fine game.  Instead, 14.Nd5 would leave Black in all sorts of strife, but it is a whole deal more complicated and harder to calculate.  If you keep things simple and straight-forward you should be good.} 14. a3 {A nice wee trap - if it were a trap, but there were better moves, such as castling (recommended) or 14.Nd5.  } Qxb2 {As it turms out, this is a terrible mistake that should have lost Black her queen.  As I have mentioned before, not for nothing is the b2-pawn called 'the poisoned pawn'.  I don't know how many are the victims I have hauled in who were careless enough to snatch my b2-pawn!  I've lost count.   Sometimes the poison takes a few moves to take effect, but here it is a fast-acting agent...} 15. Nb1 {It is hard to figure out what White was thinking here, particularly when one looks ahead to her following moves.  This knight retreat is bad, not because it loses (it should NOT lose, actually), but because the best move is so good: 15.Ra2!  Where could the Queen have moved?  Black would have had to cut her losses by 15...Qxa2 16.Nxa2 and go down the major exchange, queen for rook.  But now, White's rook is 'en prise'...} Qxa1 {I did say White's last move wasn't fatally losing, didn't I?   That is true.  In fact, just possibly Black might have been better off leaving the rook alone, and played 15...Qe5.  Just... possibly. } 16. Qe2 {This really is a terrible move, when there was so much left to play for.  I think I can see the motivation for this mistake, though, as with it, White is threatening checkmate in two moves! (17.Nf6ch K-moves 18.Qe8#).  But that overlooks the disaster to White's back rank.  Had White been castled already, this might have been a great move.  But White did have something better, that would have retained a small edge: 16.Bc3! Qa2 17.Bxg7 ... and White would have got her rook back!  } Qxb1+ 17. Bc1 {White played this move, then resigned.  She realised that she would still have to interpose with her queen, and that would have been the end of her counter-play in the e-file.  White had so much going for her in this game (apart from the overlooked checkmate at move 10): fine, quick development, solid, centralised position, more space, gains in time here and there some good decisions - all spoilt by a miscalculated counter-attack at the close. }
