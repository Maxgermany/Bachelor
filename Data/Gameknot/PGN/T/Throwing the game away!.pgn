1. d4 {This is my first annotation, so bear with me :)} b6 2. e3 Bb7 {This is an opening I've used when I first started playing chess, but I've stopped using it because there are much better openings} 3. Nf3 {like what my opponent's doing... right now he probably has better control of the centre} g6 4. Bc4 Bg7 {I do the same thing on the left side} 5. O-O Na6 {This is another reason - that knight doesn't have a lot of places to go} 6. Nh4 Nh6 {again, same on both sides} 7. Nc3 O-O 8. e4 Rc8 {although this will bring a strong attack if I can free my main pieces...} 9. f4 {my opponent STILL has a strong centre} e6 {Finally starting to develop my centre pawn pieces} 10. Nb5 c6 {yes, the white knight can attack the a7 pawn...} 11. Nxa7 {but that's a big mistake for white!} Ra8 {White's knight is doomed!} 12. Nxc6 {might as well take a piece before it dies....} dxc6 {I guess I could have attacked with the bishop as well, but it could lead to me wasting turns running away from White's pawns} 13. Nf3 c5 {trying to trade pawns while I have the piece advantage.... but I don't know enough about positioning to comment on that} 14. e5 {my opponene declined...} Nb4 {so I ignored it as well} 15. a3 Nd5 16. Qd3 f6 {I have to open up some possibilities here} 17. dxc5 bxc5 {opponent finally decided to accept the trade} 18. Qb3 Nf5 19. Qxb7 {Damn... I should have seen this... but I guess that's the difference between a 1000-point player and a 2000 point player} Nfe3 {forks the rook and bishop!} 20. Re1 {trying to save the stronger piece...} Nxc2 {but I'm still on the attack on his rooks!} 21. Bd2 {the rook already has the protection of its knight, so there could be better moves for white here... but again, there could be an advantage in this that I'm not seeing} Nxa1 22. Rxa1 Rb8 {chasing away the queen} 23. Qc6 Nxf4 24. Bxf4 {another stupid mistake! I have three days to make these moves, and I still manage to make silly, amateur mistakes...} Rxb2 {at least we're even on points} 25. Qxe6+ {well, we WERE even on points} Kh8 {only move} 26. Qh3 fxe5 {chases away the bishop, and wins back the lost pawn} 27. Ng5 {using the bishop as a sacrifice to get a sneaky checkmate... I guess he thought he could get away with it considering the mistakes I've made... } h6 {but not this time!} 28. Ne6 {fork! ouch!} Qe7 29. Nxf8 Qxf8 30. Bxe5 Bxe5 {now my opponent makes a similar blunder, and we are tied again} 31. Qd3 g5 {protecting my pawn} 32. Qe4 Qd6 {should have moved the queen yo e8 or e7... then on the next turn, I could have gone bxh2 and captured white's queen} 33. g3 Bd4+ 34. Kh1 Qc6 {forking the - wait, no -} 35. Qxc6 {*bangs head furiously against wall* this is the worst mistake anyone can make in a chess game! What the hell was I thinking?} Kg7 {I've lost already, but I won't give up yet... preventing checkmate from the queen} 36. Qd5 Rd2 {unneccesary - the pawn was protecting the bishop} 37. Qf7+ {not that it mattered...} Kh8 38. Qg8# {good game... and I'm hoping never to make such a horrible mistake again}
