1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {ruy lopez - exchange variation, my favorite.} 5. b3 {an unsound move. 0-0 is the theory. the c1 bishop has an important job to keep f4 square in variations so it wouldnt be smart to put it on b2.} Bg4 6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 Bc5 8. Bb2 f6 9. d3 {white created "holes" in his black squares on the queen side.} Ne7 10. Nd2 Ng6 11. O-O Qd6 {black wants 0-0-0 and to attack in the king side.} 12. a4 Nf4 {the bishop on b2 cant take on f4...} 13. Nc4 Qd7 14. Bc3 O-O-O 15. Bd2 h5 {black gives a pawn. I think it is not that good but it is playable in order to attack.} 16. Bxf4 exf4 17. Qxf4 Rdf8 18. Ne3 g5 19. Qf3 Rh6 {?! white plays Nf5 and the rook must go back. a waste of time.} 20. Nf5 Rhh8 21. Rad1 Kb8 22. d4 Ba7 23. d5 Rfg8 {g4 is a threat now.} 24. dxc6 Qxc6 {black is with a pawn down but he is pushing white and attacking all the time.} 25. Ne7 {black missed that one...} Qe6 26. Nxg8 Qxg8 27. Qxf6 Bc5 28. Rfe1 g4 29. Qh4 g3 {black is trying to "fish" in the king side. basically white has a great material advantage.} 30. Kh1 gxf2 31. Ref1 Ka7 32. b4 Qg7 {?? why giving up the piece?} 33. Rxf2 {?? why not takig the piece?} Bxf2 34. Qxf2+ Kb8 35. c4 Rf8 {white is won with his central pawn....} 36. Qe2 Qe5 37. Rd5 Qg3 38. Rxh5 {Rf5 prevents the mess...} Rf2 39. Rh8+ Ka7 40. Rg8 {only move.} Qf4 41. g3 Qc1+ {the end...}
