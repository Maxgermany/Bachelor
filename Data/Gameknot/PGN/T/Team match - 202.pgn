[Opening "Philidor (C41), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's defense.} 3. Bc4 {Steinitz variation.} Qf6 4. d3 c6 5. Ng5 h6 {With the bishop's focus on Pf7, this move does not prevent Nxf7 or Bxf7+.  I like Be6 instead.} 6. Bxf7+ Ke7 7. Bxg8 hxg5 8. Bc4 b5 9. Bb3 Na6 10. Nd2 d5 11. Nf3 Bg4 12. h3 Bxf3 13. Qxf3 Qxf3 14. gxf3 Kf6 15. exd5 c5 16. c4 bxc4 17. dxc4 {While this undoubles white's pawns, BxP threatens black's knight.} Nb4 18. O-O {Castling, of course, leaves h3 undefended.  Rg1 instead would have put pressure on Pg5.  White's bishop defends against Nc2+.} Rxh3 19. a3 Nd3 20. Rb1 Rxf3 {Mm, I'm thinking Bd6.  This lets the a rook slide over to the h rank.  But this does even up the points.} 21. Kg2 g4 22. Bd1 Nf4+ 23. Bxf4 Rxf4 24. b3 Bd6 25. Kg3 Rh8 {Kg5 would have saved Pg4.  26. f3 Rh8.  27. Pxg4--white would not do this because RxRf1 for free.} 26. Bxg4 g5 27. a4 e4 28. f3 {Rxf3+ is a "free" pawn.  But it pins black's f rook against the king where the white bishop will ultimately trade for it.  Kg6 yields the game's momentum back to white, who enjoys a pawn lead.  Pe3, 26. Rh1.  RxRh1.  27.  RxRh1.  Rxc4+.  Wonder if we can do that earlier...  Pe3, 26. Rh1 (seems like a good move for white) Rxc4+.  White won't interpose f4 since Bxf4+.  27. Kg2. Rc2+.  28. Kg1 (I like how this is going).  Rxh1+.  Kxh1.  29.  Bg3.  This keeps white's rook off e1, for ultimate pawn promotion.   30. Kg1, e2...  Or 30. Pf4 doesn't help white--Pg5xPf4.  I could be overlooking something--it would be interesting to see GameKnot's analysis.} Rxf3+ 29. Kg2 Rh2+ 30. Kg1 Rxf1+ 31. Rxf1+ Kg6 {Kg7 instead doesn't save Pe4, but makes white work a little harder for it.} 32. Bf5+ Kh5 33. Bxe4 Kh4 34. Bg2 Kg3 35. Rf3+ Kg4 36. a5 Kh4 37. a6 g4 38. Rf8 {I like Rf7 better, it distracts black from the fact the king is about to be pinned against the rook.} Kg3 39. Rf2 Bf4 40. Re2 Rh8 41. Re7 Bb8 42. d6 Rd8 43. d7 Bd6 44. Rf7 Be5 45. Bc6 Rb8 46. Bb7 Rh8 47. Kf1 Rh1+ {Bc7 would have been much better.  White would be unable to promote that pawn without a bunch of rook moves.  Black could sacrifice the rook  later to maybe promote the g pawn--though this would be difficult with white's rook.} 48. Bxh1 {}
