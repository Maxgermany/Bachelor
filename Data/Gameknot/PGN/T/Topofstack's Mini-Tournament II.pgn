[Opening "Sicilian (B34), accelerated fianchetto, exchange variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Usual Sicilian Opening} 3. d4 cxd4 {So B32, Flohr Variation it is.} 4. Nxd4 g6 {Transposing to B34, accelearted fianchetto, exchange variaten. } 5. Nxc6 bxc6 {Interestingly the GameKnot db states: bxc6 good, dxc6 bad... so it seems like the right choice (always towards the center, although this leaves a an isolated pawn...) This is where the opening DB ends...} 6. Nc3 Bg7 {Starting development and a not so uncommon situation with the accelerated dragon} 7. Bd2 {?! This move confused me, it allows me to do the next move and gain a greater influence on the center} d5 8. exd5 cxd5 9. Bb5+ Bd7 10. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {White doing a check that does not change the situation but only simplifies the situation by reducing the remaining pieces. However white is ahead in development for the loss of both central pawns which black wants to exploit} 11. O-O e6 {securing the center and preparing castling} 12. Re1 Ne7 13. Rb1 O-O {In this situation White's pieces aim all towards the kings side but have no real means of causing any harm. Meanwhile black can start to apply pressure on the queens side with two half-open files} 14. h3 {Another move beyond my grasp probably an all out attack with the pawns in mind?} Nf5 15. Ne2 {The knight on the has a nice and cosy home on f5, although  e4 would probably be a bit nicer} Rab8 16. b3 {Starting to use the half open file} Qb5 {Getting the queen at a more active spot, provoking the knight to come back and white to lose tempi} 17. Nc3 Qa6 18. Na4 Rfc8 {Now black has build up quite some pressure on the Queen's side while it's King's side is simply protected by the pawnstructure and the minor pieces. Right now I don't see a lot white could do to attack} 19. c3 Qd6 {Since white has barricaded itself on the Queen's side, time to switch to the King's side. Possible attacks could be Be5, Nh4 or even a march of the pawns} 20. g3 {Now this is the situation in which I saw the opportunity to greaten the control over the map. White has right now a good grip of the first 3 ranks and parts of the fourth rank, but the last move allows me to diminish White's influence to a quarter of the board.} Nxg3 {! This gives me a free pawn, if white decides to let go. Otherwise it allows Qxg3+ ... Qxh3+} 21. fxg3 Qxg3+ 22. Kf1 Qxh3+ {And this is what happend} 23. Ke2 Qg2+ {Time to drive the King and all of White's pieces to a single location. GameKnot's Analysis however says this move, followed by Kd3 and Qg3 + allows white to return to the game. White could now apply huge pressure on the Kingsside} 24. Kd3 e5 {And the pawns start marching.The Bishop has 4 Squares, the Queen has 3, the Rook on e1 has 2 and the other rook has 3. The knight is left with only one field. White is barely able to move.  This is again marked as inaccuracy. Which I dont really get yet :D} 25. Re2 {White is desperate to keep the queen away, only limiting his defensive options. (Again marked as inaccuracy because the queens seems to be a more flexible defender)} e4+ 26. Kc2 Qf3 {Now white's really in trouble. After Qd3+ there's nothing left, so Re3 and Be3 are the only options} 27. Re3 Qf5 28. Nb2 {? This move makes d4 even more effective and traps the king even more. (Analysis agrees with me the first time ;D, QH1 would be it's choice)} d4 29. Re1 e3+ {!? Getting rid of the only piece thats defending c4 any more... allowing xc3  Actually the two last moves are seen as blunders. Whites Re1 allows xc3 and then 30 ... xb2+. 30.Bxc3 is followed by Rxc3 and Kd2 Rd8+.  So I did not really get the best out of this situation} 30. Nd3 exd2 31. Kxd2 {Since he took with the King, there are many options, but I found Bh6+ to be the most effective. He can sacrifice his Knight or return to c2, traping him again  Actually this allows a Mate in 11: 31. Kxd2 Rxc3 32. Re7 Rxd3+ 33. Ke2 Rg3 34. Qh1 d3+ 35. Kd1 Qg4+ 36. Kd2 Bh6+ 37. Kc3 Qc8+ 38. Rc7 Qxc7+ 39. Qc6 Qxc6+ 40. Kb2 Bg7+ 41. Ka3 Qa6#} Bh6+ {Another Blunder Rxc3 seems to be even stronger} 32. Kc2 Rxc3+ 33. Kb2 Rxd3 {Another lost minor piece and the Queen trapped} 34. Qe2 {Actually there was still hope. Re5 could have made a little difference} Rd2+ {With the queen gone, White resigned}
