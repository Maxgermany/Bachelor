1. e4 {white plays an opening which black isn't to familiar with but doesn't seem to punish blacks innaccuracies, in what looks like an equal position black sacrifes a pawn for a strong attack on the white king, white returns the pawn immediately to try and appease the black army but returning the pawn was not good the black army snacks on the tasty white pawn then ploughs onward to the white king} e5 {against e4 i often play Alekhines defence i guess i felt like playing something more normal for some reason} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez} a6 4. Bxc6 {white plays the open Ruy Lopez, an opening im not at all familiar with, i just tried to play sensibly and not lose out of the opening} dxc6 {this i knew was the main line after this though im ashamed to say i had no clue} 5. O-O {now the black e pawn is threatened as ...Qd4 no longer works} Bd6 {defending the pawn, seemed a sensible way to do so at the time.} 6. d4 {when this was played it seemed to me to be quite strong.} f6 {it was either this, Qe7 which just doesn't seem natural or surrendering the centre completely with exd4. maybe there is some tactical defence here but i couldn't see it} 7. Re1 {sencible, pointing your rook at your opponents king can't be bad here. obviously white doesn't want to releave the central tension just yet, both sides will fight to make concessions in the centre by trying to force each other to relieve the tension unfavourably} Bg4 8. dxe5 {? white gives up the fight a little to easily} fxe5 9. Qd3 {breaking the pin on the knight but i don't feel hte pin is of much importance now. white should probably start to develop his queenside} Nf6 {now the kings knight can come to its most natural square, black also has the option of castling on either side here} 10. Bg5 O-O {because of the pin on the knight i decide to castle short as the queen belongs on d7 but after 10...Qd7 11.Bxf6 gxf6leaves the f pawn weak but black does have the half open g file to operate on} 11. Nh4 {?! not entirely sure of the point of this here. obviously white wants a knight on f5 but this cannot be achieved yet, he should be patient and continue development before trying to post a knight on f5} Qd7 12. Bxf6 {now black can double rooks on his half open f file and prepare an attack} Rxf6 13. Nd2 {white continues development. i'd give black a small plus here} Raf8 {doubling rooks, getting as many pieces as possible into offencive positions before pushing forward.} 14. Ndf3 {? this allows black a strong attack} g5 {! sacrificing a pawn to open lines and get more pieces over to the kingside, as black has a development andvantage and a kingside majority this seems like a good idea} 15. Nxg5 {another try might be 15.Nf5 Bxf5 16.exf5 Qxf5 17.Qb3  but blacks piece are still menicingly placed but white still has some drawing chances as the black pawns are weak} Qg7 {the point of 14...g5, the queen now takes up residence on the g file and the two loose white knights provide tempii for the black pieces} 16. f4 {?! there were a couple of other options here, Qg3 looks good at first but after 16...Qxg5 17.h3 Rh6 the knight can't retreat to f3 as 18...Rxf3! 19.gxf3 Rxh3 or f5 due to 18...Rxf5 19.exf5 e4 with a massive attack. so it infact leads to white losing a knight and the queens being traded.   Ngf3 and Nhf3 both lose to Rxf3! as the rook is invunrable  Nh3 looks to be the best try but the now familiar move Rf3 looks good although white can now give up his queen for the 2 rooks by 17.gxf3! Rxf3 18.Qxf3 (not 18.Nxf3?? Bxf3 ) Bxf3  when the position is quite good for black after 19.Kf1 Bg4 20.Ng1 Qf6 when white should play 21.Nf5 (not 21.Ng2? Bc5) bxf5 22.exf5 Qxf5 when the loose positon surely favours the queen over the two rooks} Rf6xf4 {not exf4 blocking the rooks line to the king} 17. Qb3+ {?! the white queen decides to abandon the kingside an grab a few more pawns on the queenside, the plan was to play Ne6 after Kh8 but it doesn't work as the h4 knight is en prise, however it is hard to find anything better, Qg3 now loses to 17...Qxg5 18.h3 Bc5  with Bf2 to follow} Kh8 18. g3 {a nice little trap by white here. if black isn't careful and plays 18...Qxg5? white plays 19.gxf4 Qxh4 when white has drawing chances} Bc5+ {in order to prevent Qe3 when white can hang on} 19. Kh1 {better than 19.Kg2 Rf2  20.Kh1 Qxg5} Rf4f6 {if 19...Rf2?? white realises his plan of Ne6, this simply wins the knight} 20. Qxb7 {? the white queen should stay and guard the kingside} Qxg5 21. Qxc7 {?? walks into forced mate but i don't think the white king can avoid the noose much longer} Qxh4 {! removes the defender of f3 and so threatens 22...Bf3# to which there is no answer as either rook move (Re3 or Rf1) loses to R(x)f1  when the king is mated by Q(or B)h3 so white resigns. i hope you enjoyed this little game, i know i enjoyed playing it. as usual if you have any questions/comments or if i've missed something in my analysis please feel free to message me.}
