1. e4 {He was always a e4 player. } c5 {So I respond with the good reliable c5} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 {All mainline stuff going on here. } 4. Nxd4 g6 {The accelerated dragon, it's finind it's way into alot of my games recently.} 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Be2 {This opponent has his own way of playing. I tend to see the LSB develop to c4 more often than this.} O-O 8. O-O {My opponent never castles queenside though, something he said to me that he is planning on changing soon.} h6 {The first really poor move. An unnecssary waste of time and probably a little weakning as well. The idea was to play Kh7 and prevent this Qd2 Bh6 combination that has been annoying on occasions.} 9. f4 {Another trait of my opponent, he loves his f4 pushes. I personally think it's slightly early myself.} Nc6 10. h3 {?! My opponent returnes the favour of my ...h6 This allows for a nice little move from myself.} Qb6 {! comes with many threats here, plus it probably wins atleast one pawn as it threatns both whites e pawn and his b pawn.} 11. Na4 {After the game my opponent said he was considering either paying this or Qd3.} Qb4 {? Just one of those things, I suppose I must have been a little burnt out after this weekend tournament because the move I had meant to play was actually Qa5 which would have been best.} 12. c3 {! protects the knight as well as attacks thequeen.} Qa5 13. b4 Qd8 {I wanted to play Qc7 however that just allows Nb5.} 14. Qc2 d5 {There was a point behind this move, I have forgotten what it was though.} 15. e5 Ne4 {I suppose I couldn't help but place my knight on the square when I see a hole thats protected by a pawn.} 16. Bd3 Nxd4 {?! Not very wise really, it just improves my opponents position.} 17. cxd4 Bf5 {? I thought I had something ready for g4, obviously I was mistaken.} 18. g4 Rc8 19. Qg2 Ng3 {?? Chess blindness. I completly forgot about gxf5. The point here was that if Qxg3 then Bxd3. But like I say, I forgot about gxf5. Bd7 was the only way to go I think.} 20. gxf5 {!} Nxf1 21. Rxf1 b5 {I guess I was just demoralised at this point, the next couple of moves are terrible.} 22. Nc5 Qb6 23. Nd7 {Any aside from this bad gae I did have a couple of good ones, my average opponent rating wasn't too bad anyway, much higher than my actual rating which I dont think is very accurate. }
