1. Nf3 d6 2. e4 Bg4 {Black could have played into either a Pirc or a Phillador's (which does actually occur) here but chooses to keep the game in independent lines for at least a while} 3. Bc4 {With the optomism of Bxf7+} e5 4. c3 {Preparing d4 and taking the game into quite an unusual branch of the Philladors} Nf6 5. Qb3 {This move certainly feels provocative but in all lines simply looks good for white. Perhaps Nf6 was a bit of a blunder} Bh5 6. Qxb7 Nbd7 7. d3 {White isn't afraid of the doubled f-pawns as the rook can develop to g1 whilst the blocked dark square bishop and strong white grip of the centre should ensure relative king safety on the queen side. If black ever does manage to gain an attack then the extra centre pawn will allow white to liquify at his discretion and potentially punish any over extension.} Bxf3 8. gxf3 Be7 9. Rg1 O-O 10. Bh6 Nh5 {Black's pieces look very discoordianted at this point. The knight may prove useful on h5 with pressure over f4 but aside from that, the bishop is very restricted and the queen isn't doing anything.} 11. b4 {Taking over c5 to prevent the d7 knight from hoping into there. The queen can still retreat to a6 and a4 if the rook moves to b8 } Re8 {The thinking behind move is quite good as it simply improves Black's position a little bit. The pin is removed and c6, d5, ideas come into play where White's king could potentially get caught out and the light-squared bishop will prove to be misplaced. } 12. Qd5 {Sadly this move shows up Re8 somewhat. The rook is forced back and although the queen doesn't particularly want to be on d5 it isn't much worse than b7.} Rf8 13. Nd2 Nb6 14. Qa5 {This has actually improved the queen despite the decentralisation as it wasn't actually doing much in the middle. I felt that Black should play c6 at this point though after, 0-0-0, d5, Bb3 White will have chances to fight back for the centre with an eventual Re1 whilst Black will struggle to progress. } Re8 15. Bb5 Rf8 16. Bc6 {Preventing any central gains by Black} Rb8 17. Qxa7 {This looks very greedy but the purpose of the move is deeper than simply grabbing a pawn. The condensed nature of the position is making it difficult for White's extra pawn so far to have meaningful sway but creating a passed pawn on the wing gives White a simple plan of queenside expansion that makes improving the position much easier than before. } Bf6 18. Qa3 {With the idea of Qb3 and pushing the a-pawn} Qe7 19. Qb3 {Stopping d5 and Black from developing counterplay in the middle against the wing play. } Nc8 {Not a good move. The b-pawn isn't going to be a weakness of any kind even with the queen behind it and ideas of Rb6, c6, d5 can be fought off with a4, Rb6, b5, followed by a5 and the pawns quickly expanding.} 20. a4 Rd8 {Not very consistent to Nc8} 21. a5 {It's not a complex plan but it's the only plan on the board so it's very effective.} g6 22. a6 Na7 23. Ba4 c6 {Trying to blockade against the White build-up but Black has lost all means of striking out against White by being passive over the past few moves and now White just needs to pick Black off at his leisure. } 24. c4 {Both stopping d5 and continuing on the queenside} Bg7 25. Bxg7 {In hindsight this was a weak move. The White bishop was doing a good job of securing f4 whilst the Black wasn't having any impact on the position.} Kxg7 26. b5 Qc7 27. Rb1 c5 28. b6 Qe7 29. Qa2 Nc8 30. a7 {Although material is captured White loses all the pressure and actually has more of a contest than he visually should have. This all stems from swapping off the dark-squared bishops. } Nxa7 31. bxa7 Qxa7 32. Rxb8 {Avoiding disentanglement because of Rxb1, Qxb1, Qxa4 ideas so now the knight can move. That said, finding a meaningful outpost is something of a quest rather than a manoeuvre. } Rxb8 33. Bb3 Qb7 {At this point I was overly optimistic. The queenside files are secured and now one would expect the extra piece to win the game easily. After Kd1 this may be the case as Nf4 can be met Kc2 and the rook can get involved. Sadly though White has a spell of weak moves from this point onwards. } 34. Ke2 {With the same idea of getting the rook involved but pathetically missing that when on f4 the knight would have g2 to check the king from.} Nf4+ 35. Ke3 h5 {Now White has to try to find a way to progress which is remarkably difficult considering the material.} 36. Qa4 Nh3 37. Ra1 {Black has allowed White more activity there than he probably should have done} Qe7 {Very much going on the offensive. Play needs to be quite accurate from this point onwards and I realised that the win would require more effort than a few moves ago with rather firm calculation.} 38. Ke2 {White rationalises that it's going to take a few pawns to get coordinated and d3 is the first to go. Though aesthetically important as the back of the chain, the pawn structure and blocked nature means that e4 and c4 aren't actually vulnerable.} Nf4+ 39. Kd1 Nxd3 40. Qa7 Nxf2+ {Gobbling a second pawn } 41. Ke2 {Winning a tempo and committing Black's pieces to squares.} Rb7 {Forced} 42. Qa6 Nh3 43. Qc6 {Now the rook can invade on the a file} Nf4+ 44. Kd1 Rc7 45. Qa8 Qh4 46. Qb8 {This next move really makes me have a think} Qxh2 {Qxc7 was briefly looked at but a more decisive move was quickly found. I do imagine I can get away with snapping the rook but the next is stronger} 47. Ra8 {Threatening Qh8#. I'd had to see that Black can neither get a mate himself or perpetual which was a little tricky. In the end though the line which occurs when the knight is given for king safety was spotted and from there I could confidently play Ra8} Qe2+ 48. Kc1 Nd3+ 49. Kc2 Nb4+ 50. Kb2 {Kb1 would have transposed after Qe1+} Qxd2+ 51. Ka3 Qc1+ 52. Ka4 {And the check's cease as Qa1+, Kb5 leaves Black's queen hanging.} Re7 {Missing the more crucial detail of the position} 53. Qh8# {}
