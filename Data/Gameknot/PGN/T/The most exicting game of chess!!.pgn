1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 {Starting position of the modern benoni} 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. f4 {White has many options here but none as aggressive and cut throat as this one} Bg7 8. Bb5+ {Tiamonov(flick-knife) attack super sharp. } Nbd7 {!? Ultra sharp in the main line black willingly goes down two full pieces just to get at the white king. At that point it is all out war. } 9. e5 {Best since 9.nf3 a6! Leads to better chances for black } dxe5 10. fxe5 {White is playing to squish black like puny little insect. } Nh5 {We will not go quietly, we stand and fight say,"You shall not pass!" } 11. e6 {Ok, maybe we will let you come this far but further. } Qh4+ {I see the king men "get him!"} 12. Kd2 {White king gives the black forces the moon! He may pay for that.} fxe6 {I have to weaken that white washed wall in the centre. } 13. dxe6 {I have no choice but to sacrifice the knight and bishop in order to safe gaurd the king. } O-O {Somebody is going to get into trouble. } 14. exd7 Bxd7 15. Bxd7 {Just look at the white kings men just standing around doing nothing. } Rf2+ {!? Ready or not here comes the Boom. The alternative 15...Bxc3 is not so boom but less nightmarish} 16. Nge2 Rd8 {This is the kind of stuff that nightmares are made of. } 17. Qb3+ {!? A super sharp play hitting at b7! } c4 {! The best. ...Bxc3 give white the upper hand in the end 17.Kxc3!} 18. Qb5 {The tactics on the board are mind boggling. It is a good thing I have played these lines in the past. } Kh8 {Sssh be very very quiet we are hunting rabbits. } 19. Rd1 {Is it over can we come out now? } Nf6 {No!! The blood is about to split.   This is my novelty after studying this game http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x1271871&fb=1&mv=34&rnd=0.9800148400541135 } 20. Kc2 {The point is that black can now defend d7 and and will regain his material with a strong attack} Rxe2+ {The computer suggests 20...rg2?? As the way to recover the material. But after 21. Qb7!!  black is busted. } 21. Nxe2 {? 21.Rd2 is the toughest. After the exchanges on the d-file it will become war of attrition with black having the better of it. However it is not clear how black can win. } Qe4+ {White resigns. }
