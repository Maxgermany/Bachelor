1. e4 e5 {allowing me the gambit} 2. f4 {gambit} exf4 {he accepts.} 3. Bc4 {now i move it into a king bishop's gambit.} Nf6 {attacking the pawn} 4. d3 {guarding and setting up retrivial of the gambit pawn} Bd6 {guards. (i have noticed all attempts to guard the gambit pawn always fail)} 5. Nc3 {i see the fork but i like to develope more first.} c6 {blocking my knights squares.} 6. Nf3 b5 {this always happens i do not mind just back it off some} 7. Bb3 a5 {he wants to trap the bishop but i got an idea for that.} 8. a4 Bc5 {i asume he is gonna do ng4 next so i got some time here becasue i can answer ng4 with d4 so i figured my bes bet was to retake the gambit pawn.} 9. Bxf4 Ng4 {what i say?} 10. d4 b4 {sure ill trade that.} 11. dxc5 bxc3 12. bxc3 {no i got triple c pawns but i do not mind} Qe7 13. Ng5 h6 {pushing the knight away but i guess he missed the bshop hitting f7 aswell.} 14. Nxf7 Rf8 15. Nd6+ Kd8 {at this point i relize a mate if i can get the bishop to c7, all i got to do is check the king again at f7 and he'll move it back for me to move the bishop into place. so let me rearrange my pieces so i can capitalize on this, first of all the hanging knight on g4.} 16. Qxg4 Na6 {i think he sees my plan but ill think of somthine on the fly} 17. Qh5 {setting up a discoverd check attack} Nxc5 {hmm well that helps.} 18. Nf7+ Ke8 19. Bc7 {bishop in place.} Rxf7 {he saw the mate and stopped it best he coul but it only delays the pain.} 20. Bxf7+ {i know this is not forcing he can just go to f8 but then ill castle king siade with tempo setting up a second discoverd check attack.} Qxf7 {he decides to take.} 21. Qxc5 {so shall i.} Qe7 {this is just a mistake pure and simple.} 22. Qe5 {pinning the queen and forcing a trade.} g5 {instead he opens the lines for a mating attack. thx.} 23. O-O {its all over i only see moving his queen as the saving move but he cannot move it unless he trades so he should trade, but even after the trade my game is much better as my rooks can do the damage in a few moves.} Ra7 {he decides to push the bishop around} 24. Qh8+ Qf8 25. Qxf8# {and mate.}
