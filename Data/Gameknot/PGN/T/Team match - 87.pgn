1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 e5 {I gain a free pawn.} 4. dxe5 Bb4 5. Bd2 Bg4 6. h3 Bxf3 7. exf3 {Exchange of pieces.} f6 8. exf6 Qxf6 {Exchange of pawns.} 9. Nxd5 {I take the unprotected pawn.} Qd6 10. Bb5 {This was actually a stupid move on my part. My knight is now unprotected and Black is free to take it with the queen.} a6 {Black doesn't take the knight, for some reason. Phew!} 11. Bxb4 {Taking Black's bishop and threatening the queen.} Qe5+ 12. Be2 Qxb2 {Black takes my pawn.} 13. Nxc7+ {I take Black's pawn and pin the king. } Kf7 14. Nxa8 {Taking the Rook.} Nxb4 {Black takes my unprotected bishop.} 15. Nc7 {Moving my knight back out} Ne7 16. Bc4+ {This move was mainly to bring in the bishop to protect e6 and make it possible for my knight to move to that square.} Kg6 17. Ne6 Nf5 18. Nf4+ Kf6 19. Rb1 {Threatening the queen. } Qe5+ 20. Ne2 {If I were Black in this situation, I would do Nc6 to avoid losing a knight. } Nd4 21. f4 Qe4 22. Rxb4 {Taking Black's unprotected knight.} Nxe2 {Thus begins checkmate. } 23. Qd6+ {Checking the king. Black's only move at this point is either a useless interposition by the Queen or else moving the king to f5, which is what he did. } Kf5 24. g4# {Mate. I think several of Black's key mistakes in this game were 1) move number twelve, when he didn't take precautions against the King being pinned and I was able to gain myself a Rook, and 2) leaving a lot of pieces unprotected and taking too many unnecessary risks. Like the knight on b4; that knight could have easily retreated to c6, but instead, Black moved the other knight forward into my territory. That knight was protecting the key square at d6; if that knight hadn't moved last turn, my queen wouldn't have been able to move to that square to check the king. }
