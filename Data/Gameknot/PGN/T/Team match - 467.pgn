1. d4 {In this game features subtle manouvering and was a good test of my patience as it is the longest game I have played on gameknot to date.  It took me a long time to find the right point to attack and create the slightest of advantages. My opponent played an excellent game and he was deserving of the draw} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {I am excepting ...d5} Bb4 {Ninzo indain a great choice to fight for a win!} 4. Nf3 {There is no point in provoking the bishop until d4 and e4 are well supported. } b6 5. Bg5 h6 {It is a good idea to break the pin because a lot of Black's counters derive from playing for the e4 square. } 6. Bh4 Bb7 7. e3 g5 8. Bg3 Ne4 9. Qc2 Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 {This position slightly favors black but white is not without opportunity. In order to achieve that sac on c3 black has had to give up the bishop pair and expose his king side. However, in exchagne black has a superb knight and strong bishop. } d6 11. Bd3 {Forcing the exchange of Black's strongest piece and developing the bishop to a good diagonal } Nxg3 12. hxg3 Nd7 {safegaurding c5 and e5} 13. Be4 {Removing Black's last bashin of attackers. However, now the game will take on a very dull and quiet feel. } Bxe4 14. Qxe4 {White is ahead in development, has a bit more space. But his pawn structure is less than ideal and black has no concrete weaknesses. This game is drawn... or is it!} Nf6 15. Qc2 g4 {a bit risky since his king side is starting to show signs of fatigue. } 16. Nd2 {supporting c4 and adding pressure in the centre} Qd7 {Developing the queen to the good diagonal and preparing castling} 17. e4 {This allowes me to meet ...d5 with e5 } Qc6 {of course the e-pawn is very weak on e4} 18. a4 {the idea is to exchange queens on b5 and thus loosen black's pressure on e4. } a5 {Black does not want the queen side open because it would favor white} 19. Qb1 O-O-O 20. Qb5 Qxb5 21. cxb5 {weakening control over d5 but resolving a pawn issue} Rdg8 22. Ke2 {The king is a powerful piece capable of defending himself} h5 23. Rag1 {played so I can play f4 on the next move} Kb7 24. f4 Rgd8 {black makes a wise choice not to allow the openning the lines which would favor white slightly. } 25. Kd3 {the game is pretty much drawn if black can things closed } Ne8 26. Rge1 Ng7 27. Nf1 {repositioning the knight to the stronger e3 square. } d5 {? This first signs of a crack. A bit risky since this opens things up and allows white to take advantage of his greater influence in the centre. However, black played it to create an outpost for his knight on c4. } 28. exd5 Rxd5 29. Ne3 {gaining intitative against the rook. } Rdd8 30. Ref1 {this move adds considerable pressure on the f file.} f6 {? it pays to make your opponent uncomfortable. } 31. f5 {! securing a permanent + in space. Black is forced to play e5 which allows D5! creating a wedge into black's defence. } e5 32. d5 {white has setup a mazony bind on e6 and c6} Rh7 33. c4 {supporting d5 and freeing the knight for other duties. Even though white has a strong bind on e6 it is still very difficult for him to exploit that. So more sacs need to be made. } Rdh8 {Black is thinking of drumming up counterplay on the a file. } 34. Rh4 {preventing black's only counter attack. } Ne8 {The knight will be ideally placed on d6. if possible block advanced pawns with your knigths. } 35. Rc1 {counting on 35. ...Nd6 when 36. c5 would secure the c file in whites favor} Nd6 36. c5 bxc5 37. Rxc5 {White is worming his way into a hole. } Rg8 38. Rh1 {white has acheived a superior endgame due to his better positioned peices. once last task before the final breakthrough is to reorganize the remaining rook. Plan 39. Rb1 threatening b6! which wins a pawn. } Rg5 39. Rb1 Ka7 40. Rc6 e4+ 41. Kc3 Nxf5 42. Nc4 {NxN activates the rook this regains the pawn} Ne7 43. Ra6+ Kb8 44. Nxa5 Nxd5+ 45. Kd4 Kc8 46. Ra8+ Kd7 47. Nb7 Nb6 48. Rd8+ Ke6 49. a5 {The result after a fury of exchanges and checks I am a pawn down but control the centre,  well coordinated pieces and the intative which is desisive. } Rd7+ 50. Rxd7 Nxd7 51. Kxe4 Rd5 52. Nd8+ Kd6 53. a6 Nb6 54. a7 f5+ 55. Ke3 Kc5 56. Ne6+ {recentralizing the knight to d4 to allow for Ra1} Kd6 57. Nd4 Na8 58. Rc1 Kd7 59. Rf1 {winning the pawn. Black will be forced to exchange everything on the king side. My king will eat up all of black's remaining pawns and my pawns will march to freedom and glory} Kc8 60. Rxf5 Rxf5 61. Nxf5 Kb7 62. Ne7 Kxa7 63. Nd5 Kb7 64. Kf4 Nb6 65. Ne3 Nd7 66. Kg5 Kb6 67. Nd5+ Kxb5 68. Nxc7+ Kc4 69. Kxh5 Ne5 70. Kg5 Kd3 71. Kf4 {black resigns}
