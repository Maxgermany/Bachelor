1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez is on the board.} a6 {Morphy defense.} 4. Ba4 d6 {Modern Steinitz defense} 5. d4 b5 {White threatens d5 winning the knight.  The threat could be ignored e.g. 5... Ne7 6. d5 b3.  Or the pin could be broken with Bd7, but the immediate b3 is sharpest, and black has equalized the position.} 6. d5 {White offers to exchange his bishop for black's knight.} bxa4 {An offer black happily accepts.  It would have been better for white to withdraw his bishop to b3.  In general it is not recommended to exchange a bishop for a knight.  However, a temporary tactical advantage can be gained in the early stages of the game when the board is crowded and the knight's ability to jump over pieces can be helpful.  Bishops on the other hand, become more powerful as the game wears on and the pieces get cleared off the board.  In this position it is not clear that white's knights will be immediately useful and black decides to go with the long term advantage of the bishop pair.  And so black gains the initiative.} 7. dxc6 Ne7 {That pesky pawn on c6 has got to go.  There is no practical way for white to defend the pawn either...} 8. Nc3 {...so he reciprocates by attacking black's pawn.  However, the situation is not equal.  Black's pawn is mostly harmless and would be best treated with benign neglect.} Nxc6 9. Nxa4 {Now the white knight is far afield with not much prospect of getting into the thick of things any time soon.} Be7 {Preparing to castle.  The immediate f5 is possible here, but black wants to take care of king safety first.  Rook b8 is also an idea as it blunts white's threat of Qd5, and allows black to respond with Bb7 with the threat of Nd4 followed by Bxe4.} 10. O-O {White castles, meanwhile his knight on a4 is still out in the cold.} O-O {Part of black's lengthy preparations for f5.} 11. c4 Be6 {Preventing Qd5 and getting a more central location for the bishop than d7 or b7.} 12. b3 Kh8 {More preparation for f5, getting the king off the diagonal that is about to be partially opened.  But the time for f5 may have passed.} 13. Bb2 {Oops, now white's bishop occupies the long diagonal with black's king on it.  Maybe this was too much concern for king safety, f5 could have been played much earlier.} f5 {f5 at last!} 14. Qd3 {How about Nc3?  Get that knight back in play, threatening to post it on d5.} Nb4 {Harassing the queen.  Also with an idea of maybe pushing d5.} 15. Qc3 {The knight is unprotected, so how to defend?} fxe4 {Defend by creating a greater threat level.  If Qxb4 then exf3 threatening to break open the white king's position.  Also, the f-file is now half open for black's rook.  However he pays for it with doubled pawns.} 16. Nxe5 {White comes up with a clever but flawed tactical idea.  Clever because black has only one correct response.  The idea is if black does the natural and correct dxe5 then white replies Qxe5 threatening the unprotected bishop on e6 and checkmate on g7.  The flaw is Rf6 stops both threats and white is down a piece for a pawn.  Because black misses the flaw in black's plan he defends incorrectly and thus white seizes the initiative.} Bf6 17. Qxb4 dxe5 {Oof, black's pawns are totally trashed (two isolated pawns and a pawn island consisting of doubled pawns).  However, 17... Bxe5 goes against the strategic idea of keeping the bishop pair and most certainly would result in 18. Bxe5 dxe5 the bishop pair is lost and the pawns are trashed anyway.  But at least black has an impressive pawn center!?} 18. Nc5 {Annoying and potentially harmful, but black is somewhat relieved to know that white's expeditionary forces are not currently aimed at his king.} Bf5 {Protecting the e4 pawn and removing the light square bishop from danger.  Remember, black wants to hang on to his bishop pair.  They're the one bright spot in his position.} 19. Qa5 {Possibly eying the a6 pawn, but that's not a great idea and white knows it.  More likely an x-ray attack on the e5 pawn.} Qd6 {Black embarks on a risky plan.  A similar but less risky idea would be Qe8.  The idea is to get the queen and light square bishop lined up on the white king's position.} 20. Ba3 {Speaking of risk, white threatens to skewer the black queen and rook.  After white gets his queen out of the skewer there is still knight takes the e4 pawn with a discovered attack on the rook on f8.  A clever but unsound tactic.  Clever because once again black missed the flaw in white's plan.  The flaw is Be7 threatening queen takes bishop on a3 if the white knight takes the e4 pawn.  And while black's play here is just as unsound as white's, black does have a plan and white is playing right into it.  (Somewhere Wilhelm Steinitz must be filled with artistic horror.)} Qc6 {Getting the queen on the long diagonal and encouraging white to take the e4 pawn so black's light square bishop can join the queen on the long diagonal.} 21. Nxe4 {Pawn grabbers usually get punished.  And this is no exception.  This is probably the losing move.} Bxe4 22. Bxf8 {O look, your rook!} Bxg2 {O look, your king!  White is in serious trouble.  Accurate defense is called for.} 23. Bxg7+ {Unfortunately that was not it.  The only positive aspect of this move, other than grabbing another pawn, is that it comes with tempo.  But it only forces black to do something he wanted to do anyway, open up the 6th rank so his queen can slide over to g6.  Almost anything was better (though nothing was good).  Pushing f3 disconnects black's queen and bishop and basically gives up a piece to stop black's attack.  Rae1 (not Rfe1 because of Bh1) slows black's momentum by putting pressure on the e5-pawn keeping the black bishop on f6 and keeping the 6th rank closed so the queen cannot slide over to g6.  Unfortunately Rae1 concedes the exchange on f1.  Even retreating the bishop to a3 at least puts the question to black does he want to equalize material or loose the exchange for the privilege of continuing the attack (answer:  concede the exchange to continue the attack).  Probably the best idea is Qc5 attempting to force a queen trade, but then black would play Qf3 threatening mate in 2 and now any queen trade will be under much less favorable circumstances for white (e.g. black gets white's bishop on f8).} Bxg7 24. Rfe1 {Much better than white's last move.  After black plays Qg6 white could play Rxe5 with his queen and rook on the 5th rank he can now interpose the rook when black moves his bishop exposing the white king to an attack from his queen.  However, this idea doesn't work because black puts his bishop on d5 with a discovered check and disconnects the white rook and queen.  So now if the white rook blocks the queen's attack, he is captured with tempo and then the white queen is next to fall (e.g. 24... Qg6 25. Rxe5 Bd5+ now if  26. Rg5 Qxg5+ 27. Kf1 Bg2+ and then 28... Qxa5).  And if you are wondering after 25. Rxe5 why not 25... Bxe5 then 26. Qxe5+.  Black is still better but his attack has ground to a halt because now the white queen can slurp up the pawn on c7 and then interpose on g3 when white moves his bishop.} Qg6 25. Re3 {And here is the other point of white's last move.  This defeats black's threat of mate in 2 (25... Bh3+ 26. Kh1 Qg2#).  However...} Bf3+ {... the situation is hopeless.} 26. Kf1 Qg2+ 27. Ke1 Qg1+ 28. Kd2 Qxf2+ {Yes, black could have taken the rook on a1, but that is a distraction from the business at hand, to checkmate the king, and besides the rook on e3 is hanging too (well it will be as soon as the king is chased away).  However, Rd8+ would have been a more accurate move.} 29. Kd3 {Attempting to hang on to his rook on e3, white steps into black's mating net.} Rd8+ 30. Qd5 {The only option.  If Kc3 then Qd2 is checkmate.} Bxd5 {Logical, but e4+ is better e.g. 30... e4+ 31. Rxe4 Bxe4+ 32. Kxe4 Re8+ 33. Qe6 (if 33. Kd3 Re3# and if 33. Qe5 Rxe5+ 34. Kd3 Re3#) Rxe6+ 34. Kd5 Qf5#} 31. cxd5 {Kc3 could have prolonged the game a few more moves.} Rxd5+ {Now white has 3 options:  Door #1: mate in 1.  32. Ke4 Rd4# Door #2: mate in 2.  32. Kc3 Qd2+ 33. Kc4 Qd4# Door #3 ...} 32. Kc4 {... white chooses door #3.  Mate in 3.} Rd4+ 33. Kc5 {Kc3 is mate in 1, e.g. 33. Kc3 Qd2#.} Qc2+ 34. Rc3 {The only move.} Qxc3# {If there is a lesson in this it is that king safety comes before all other considerations.  Probably white was blinded to his losing move (move 21) by the prospect of winning the rook on f8.  Had black responded as white expected by taking the bishop on f8, the material would have been equal.  So it wasn't that he expected a material advantage from the exploit, rather he thought black was forced to recapture the bishop on f8 to keep the material equal.  So black prevailed because he was able to look beyond a temporary material loss and see the advantage of a vicious assault on the opponent's king.}
