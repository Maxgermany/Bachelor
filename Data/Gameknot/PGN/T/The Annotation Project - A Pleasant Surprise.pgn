1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Ke8 {8. ...... Ke8 - a deviation from Kc6 or Kc7.  I could get a perpetual here if I wanted but as the game had only just begun and it was the annotation project and it would have been a Low Draw for me, I decided to take the knight on g4 instead.} 9. Bxg4 g6 {9. ...... g6 - preparing to develop his dsb.} 10. Nc3 {10. Nc3 - quick development is essential.} Qb6 11. O-O {11. 0-0 - so is castling.} Bh6 12. Ncxe4 {12. Ncxe4 - closes the material deficit by 1 point and paves the way for d3 or d4 opening up the c1-h6 diagonal for Fou Lenoir.} Nd7 13. b3 Nf6 14. Bb2 {14. Bb2 - pins the knight.  However, if dmaestro took the knight I would have no time to play Bxh8?? because I would then allow the Philidor's Legacy.  If anybody needs to get familiar with that sequence please see my note at the end of my annotation Six Feet Under.} Nxg4 {14. ...... Nxg4?? - he takes the bishop!  Now I will get onto equal material points.  Off comes that rook next move.} 15. Bxh8 Kd7 16. Bc3 {16. Bc3 - knitting together my queenside pawns and keeping Fou Lenoir on the long diagonal.} Nf6 17. Nxf6+ exf6 {17. ...... exf6 - knight trade.} 18. Ne4 Bg7 19. Ng3 {19. Ng3 - evading a possible discovery (f5) and buffering up f1.} Rg8 20. f5 Bh8 21. Rae1 {21. Rae1 - threatening Re6.} c4+ 22. Kh1 {22. Kh1 - Henry evades the discovered check from the Wicked Witch of the West.} cxb3 23. axb3 {23. axb3 - pawn trade.} Rf8 {23. ...... Rf8 - bolstering up his f6 pawn.} 24. Re3 {24. Re3 - a rook lift screening out the Witch, he is planning a possible Rd3+ next move.  But I do not have to worry because dmaestro waved the white flag.  Again, a pleasant surprise.  Cheers - Joanne}
