1. d4 {standard d4 opening} d5 {typical response me, i tend to find it's one of the better responses, i can at least play it decently} 2. c4 {queen's gambit} e6 {no way jose, that's just about not going to happen} 3. e3 {haven't seen this before,  i think he's making sure that Charlie over there doesn't lose his chocolate factory in a bad insurance deal that will leave him practically dead} Bb4+ {hola,senor king, check} 4. Bd2 {bishop blockade} Bxd2+ {the exchange of the clergy} 5. Nxd2 {recapturing and developing at the same time, so far this opening has left me farther behind then ahead} Ne7 {time to counter develop} 6. Ngf3 {here comes the empire of stormtrooping knights} b6 {fianchetto time, stops the advance dead in its tracks, no more c5, with protection at the end of it} 7. Bd3 {developing and setting to castle} Bb7 {fianchetto} 8. O-O {castle} dxc4 {lets open up the center and cause a few minor problems} 9. Nxc4 {recapture} O-O {caastling as well, much safer than sitting in the middle like a goose with an egg balanced on top of its head} 10. Rc1 {no cool, he's line up for an open file, i need to develop that knight on b bad} Nd7 {good i at least did that} 11. Be2 {pointless move, i couldn't have taken the knight and ripped the castle open anyway the queen is already protecting to recapture} Nf5 {let's get some attacks in there,eh?} 12. Bd3 {?????,alright i'm forcing the knight to move or for him to recapture and get doubled pawns} Qf6 {making sure i don't have to recapture with the pawn} 13. Nfe5 {interesting} Nxe5 {let's take back} 14. Nxe5 {recapture} Rfd8 {??????????stops pawn advance why n...oh I see there was the fork on d7, i'm ZZZZZtoday} 15. Be2 {??????} Qg5 {yep, that was what i was thinking before on move 14, why not do that now!?} 16. Rxc7 {Blunder, totally misses the purpose of Qg5, got to ove suttle moves} Qxg2# {checkmate, good game justabout, until next time, this is the GatorWarrior14 headbanging off over to youtube....}
