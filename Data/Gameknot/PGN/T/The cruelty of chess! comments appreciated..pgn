1. d4 {Hey hey all, I decided to save this game because there was a nice crafty line in the end that turned this game around for me after flat out blundering on move 7,} Nf6 {ive been practicing the budapest counter for d4 players and had some interesting games with it. but this being my 6 to 8th game with this opening im not familiar with all avenues yet } 2. c4 {natural reply} e5 {temporary pawn gambit} 3. d5 {bam... already uncharted territory,   not once, in my games with this opening, has white replied the same at this stage. i faced a new reply each time. also only 1 of my games so far my opponent took the gambit. interesting turn of events people of gameknot!} e4 {and so i decide to explore new lines too with an e4 push. seemed good, any objections?} 4. e3 {anticipated reply.  this board is looking hectic! 4 moves in} c6 {and so i decide to try to break middle right away} 5. a3 {defensive/passive move} cxd5 6. cxd5 {my opponent replied naturally and i had to go for that night.   the next day when i came back to play i opened this game first and i dont know what came over me lol} Nxd5 {maybe it was because i took a break from my plan from the night before, for some reason i opened the page and in my mind i was sure that was my original D pawn and that my queen was protecting my knight lol. and played within 2 seconds and went oops, needless to say i immediately logged off in rage/shame lol! we will come back to this blunderous game later after ive played a few good moves in my other games!} 7. Qxd5 {natural reply...obviously ... sigh... alright now i got some thinking to do and have to be sharp with my play.  maybe this will make my opponent over confident who knows. here's to hoping.} Qe7 {i played this in anticipation to his bishop going to bc4 and to also cover my e4 pawn} 8. Bc4 {what i thought he would do.} Nc6 {im trying to get any kind development going, and maybe any type of counter play} 9. Ne2 Ne5 {and so time to try some antics, he cannot take my e4 pawn with queen or its losing the bishop. but i was tempting him with it.} 10. Bb3 {decides to retreat the bishop. } Nd3+ {i take the oppurtunity to disrupt his castle and gain a pawn back} 11. Kd2 Nxf2 { i had anticipated his rook coming behind my knight. but felt safe leaving it there for a while and could use my queen to protect it once the rook comes.} 12. Rf1 {anticpated reply} Qf6 { i was sorta happy with my come back so far. even though i blundered i felt like i was controlling tempo/momemtum} 13. Kc2 {hmmm exetremlely curious reply i had tried to plan different lines to try to set up an attack on his queen having her in front his his king and this changed my plans and i thought i would aim to castle and get my DSB possibly into play} Bd6 {my thought here is that it attacks a hanging pawn on h3 and i thought he would reply by putting his knight on f4 } 14. Nf4 {and he did. it forces me to move my knight but my queen isnt in immediate danger} Nd3 {and my knight has a great resting spot and remains exetremly dangerous to his king.} 15. Nd2 {he develops his other knight. i dont know if white players have a better reply. as for me it was now crunch time. antics are over i got a DSB a Queen and a knight all synergised to an exposed king. come on trix you got to see something good here!  took a few moments to analyse a few lines and then i saw a very nice one with one of my favorite moves. a bishop sacrifice!} Bxa3 {boom!  if my opponent takes with his pawn he loses his Rook. so natural reply is taking with the rook} 16. Rxa3 {i was so happy with myself to had seen this cruel fork!} Nb4+ {ouch! maybe nxd5 on 6 wasnt a blunder after all >< placing that queen on that square lol. but there is no way to anticipate the king moving to c2 on 13. so this wasnt planned from where i lost my knight lol.  i just saw it appear when he played nd2 losing the cover on his a3 pawn.} 17. Kb1 Nxd5 {huge sigh of relief after such a rough start.} 18. Nxd5 {my opponent recaptures} Qe5 {i move my queen obviously and want to defend my e pawn and i see his nasty fork with his knight on my rook and king} 19. Nxe4 {curious. knight sacrifice. with a check retake i dont see his play here,} Qxe4+ {chomp check!} 20. Ka2 O-O {and after my castle my opponent resigns. i could see he was heading to c7. i think in his knight sacrifice he forgot that it would give me a check recapture, it was a good effort to get my queen to move to also stop covering the c7 square  i guess we each gave each other a blunder in this one...  all comments appreciated as always!  i just like saving the games where i get a nasty fork with to a queen capture}
