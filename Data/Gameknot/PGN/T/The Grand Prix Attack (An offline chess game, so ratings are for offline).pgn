1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 {So this is a standard begining of the Grand Prix Attack.  White has a strong center/kingside, but takes time to mess up Black's strong queenside before launching the true attack.} Nd4 6. O-O {"Let the Bishop fall!" } Nxb5 7. Nxb5 d6 8. d3 Nf6 9. Nc3 {Truely, White must have something better! That is what many players think, and just skip to Qe1, but this was the right move.} O-O 10. Qe1 {People who have not seen the Grand Prix must surely think that this move is a bit odd.} Rb8 {Black supports his Queenside advantage.} 11. Qh4 b5 12. f5 b4 {This move helped White more than Black, it gives him a free move for his Knight to enter the attack.} 13. Ne2 gxf5 14. Bh6 fxe4 {He took the poisonous pawn chain!} 15. Ng5 exd3 {Black has gotten too greedy, and shall be punished with the full force of the Grand Prix!!!} 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. Rxf6 Kxf6 18. Nf4 dxc2 {It's too late for him not to take the pawn, he's lost.} 19. Nge6+ Ke5 20. Qg5+ Ke4 21. Re1# {And so ends the life of the Black King.}
