1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 {Makes he think. Nh5 right away is good for black, and if white retires, black too, and nothing happened. If Bg3, NxB, hxN, the loss of the dsb is compensated by the h semi-open column.} g6 {A solid way to counter my scheme. } 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. c3 {I don't want to get into the well-known (by others) c4. Black's bishop will bite granite. } O-O 5. Nbd2 d6 {Expected was d5. This allows me to...} 6. e4 {Preventing Bf5. } Nc6 7. Bb5 {I lightely played this as a try. Normally, I go pawn's storming with h3, g4, etc., but against the fianchetto it hardly works. This is just another try... I didn't know it will soon become wild. } e5 {Offering a pawn, apparently. } 8. dxe5 dxe5 9. Nxe5 Nxe4 {He was preparing this, taking advantage of my exposed king. Very nice. But... will it work?} 10. Bxc6 {Just to scramble things up, since you can imagine the hard analysis work to be done here. } Nxd2 11. Qxd2 Qxd2+ 12. Kxd2 Bxe5 {In order not to lose a pawn on c6, but it loses one anyway.} 13. Bxe5 bxc6 14. Bxc7 {...and prevents the rook from check on d8. Black must have checked a move before. } Bf5 15. f3 Rac8 16. Ba5 {Controlling d8, just in case. And from a safe square. } Rfe8 17. g4 {Out of that nasty diagonal!} Be6 {This square is not bad, either. } 18. h3 {Preparing f4-5, my only plan by now. } Bd5 19. Rhf1 Bc4 20. Rf2 Re6 {Now a check is unavoidable. But it is mortal? Not at all... or is it?} 21. b3 {Just to press him a lot and making room for my king. Just in case. } Ba6 {Blunder, since } 22. c4 {releases most of the pressure against me. And allows my bishop to reach c3.} Rce8 23. f4 {Re3 is not a real threat, IMO.} c5 24. h4 {The bishop is still guarding d8, just in case. } Bb7 {There is nothing I can do to prevent this. } 25. f5 {Opening the g column is lethal for black, he won't take it. } Rd6+ 26. Kc2 {The best, even if...} Be4+ 27. Kb2 {Black has an extra support on f5, but he can't take gxf anyway! This is fun, isn't it?} Re7 {I can push f6, but what for?} 28. h5 Red7 29. hxg6 {d2 is guarded by the bishop, so I'm not scared at all. } hxg6 30. fxg6 Rxg6 {Black thinks he's nice, but now...} 31. Rf4 Bb7 32. Bc3 {The white bishop is still looking to h1, otherwise I'll be very fine. } Re7 33. Raf1 Bc8 {A blunder. } 34. Rh1 f6 35. Bxf6 Rd7 {Hoping in the check on d2, but self-blocking his own bishop. } 36. Rh8+ Kf7 37. Bd4+ {So I grab a pawn, if black comes to take the g one. } Ke6 38. Bxc5 {This is not only a pawn grab, but a trap. And this is a pity he didn't see it, otherwise he could have fighted more. } Bb7 {He didn't see my next move, but he was 3 pawns down anyway.} 39. Re8+ {He resigned. It would have been easy to delay the bishop's move and play whatever else...}
