1. e4 e5 2. f4 Bc5 {Black refrains from 2...exf4 which leads to wild play.} 3. Qh5 {!?This move is extravagant but not that bad.} d6 4. fxe5 Nc6 5. Bb5 Nh6 {!? 5...Bd7 is the main line,but this move is not bad.} 6. h3 {I don't want 6...Bg4 trapping my Queen!} O-O 7. Bxc6 bxc6 8. d3 dxe5 {? I studied this line at home before(with a little help from a book that mentions this,but doesn't go to much into it.) 8...f5 is better.9.Bxh6 gxh6 10.Nf3(10.Nd2 Rb8 11.0-0-0 Bd4 12.c3 Bxe5 is unclear)10...Rb8 11.b3(11.exf5 Rxf5 12.Qg4+ Kh8 13.d4 Rxe5+ 14.dxe5 Nxe5 is unclear)11...fxe4 12.dxe4 Qe7 13.Nbd2 Qg7 14.0-0-0 a5 with compensation for the sacrificed material.} 9.

Blunders the Rook.} 13. c3 {?! 13.Qxe8+ is better,but this move still wins for White.I didn't see that came with check because I thought he could mate me with 13...Qe1# which is illegal.} Bg4+ 14. Nf3 {14.hxg4? Qxh1+} Qh5 15. Rf1 {Removing the pin.White handles this attack very calmly.} Rad8 {Still hoping he can mate my king.} 16. hxg4 Rxd3+ 17.
