1. e4 {Marathon game : the white king moved 35 times, the black queen 45 times for a total of 108 moves.} c6 {Uh Uh ! I do not like the Caro Kahn very much !} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Nf3 e6 5. Be2 Ne7 {Everything standard.} 6. Nbd2 {The main problem in this move is that it blocks the  DSB } Ng6 7. Nb3 Nd7 {Both sides have developped.} 8. O-O Be7 9. Ne1 {I found that in the DB. It exploit the d1 h5 diagonal, frees the DSB and enable sa further Nd3 or Nc2} O-O 10. Bd3 {Carrying on with the line} c5 {Bold move.} 11. Bxf5 {rrading} exf5 12. c3 {Center contested, black has more pieces develloped, white has a better pawn structure, white controls the opened diagonals. I think that white is slightly better.} c4 {Annoying for white but black will quickly be dangerous on the queenside} 13. Nd2 Qb6 14. Nef3 {White is on defense but has strong counterplay available. Sir Lancelot leaves the court to run into battle.} f6 {Another bold move} 15. exf6 Bxf6 16. b3 Qc6 17. Bb2 Nf4 {Black is still on attack} 18. Ne1 {Sir Lancelot, back to the courtyard. Shame on him !} Rfe8 19. Kh1 {To prevent 20. Ne2+} Nf8 {The black knight prepares 20. Nf e6} 20. Qf3 Bg5 {beginning of a sequence which will create weak pawn structure on both sides} 21. bxc4 Nxg2 {Offering to trade the g knight against perceval on d2} 22. cxd5 {White's one pawn up} Qb6 23. Nb3 {Maybe Nc4 would have been better} Nh4 {The black knight retreats. White is one pawn ahead, has 2 passed pawns (which will prove to be important at the end) but his pawn structure is a disaster. White is better on the center but black controls the open file. The white king is weak... The situation is slightly in white's favour but not much.} 24. Qg3 {Only move} Qh6 {Black has a strong attack on the kingside} 25. Nf3 Nxf3 {Lancelot dies bravely beneath his loved queen.} 26. Qxf3 {This trade weakens black's attack} Bf4 27. Qg2 {No choice} Re2 {The siege machines are approaching. King Arthur doesn't feel at ease in his besieged castle} 28. Bc1 {Bringing reinforcement} Ng6 {Now the knighthood !} 29. Bxf4 Nxf4 30. Qf3 Rae8 {"Oh my king ! The next assault is about to come"} 31. Nc5 {"It doesn't matter. Counerattack, my brave knight !"} Re8e3 {"But it's serious my King !"} 32. Qxe3 {"Go to sacrifice, My Lady" - No passaran. And Dame Guenièvre charges wildly, beginning a wild battle.} Rxe3 33. fxe3 Nxd5 34. Rxf5 Qxe3 {Now the board is cleaned but the fight is far to be finished. During the next 38 moves, no pieces will be taken.} 35. Raf1 {Beginning of a long positionnal sequence during which both sideshave to be very carefull because the game is so opened that a little mistake can be fatal.} Nf6 36. Rf5f3 Qd2 37. Rf1f2 Qc1+ 38. Kg2 b6 39. Ne4 Nd7 40. Rf3f7 Qe3 41. Ng3 {As I see no way to mate the king if black doesn't do any big mistake, my idea is to bring my king near the center and push the d pawn but for that, black must let me some quietness. } Qe6 42. h3 a6 43. Rf7f3 g6 {Black king in safety, the black knight can move freely} 44. Re2 Qc6 45. Kf2 {One step toward the center} Nf6 46. Rfe3 Qd7 47. Rf3 Kg7 48. Kg2 {Back to the corner. Around this moment, I offered a draw, refused} Qd5 49. Ref2 Ne8 50. Kf1 Nd6 51. Kg1 Qg5 52. Re2 Nf5 53. Kf2 Nh4 54. Rfe3 Qf4+ {During the next 21 moves, the poor Arthur moves 19 times and is set in chess 15 times (the four last moves, being under mating menace) Black could have try to attack the a and c pawns so that he gets a passed pawn on the queenside but he opts for a direct attack on poor Arthur.} 55. Kg1 Nf3+ 56. Kg2 Nh4+ 57. Kg1 Qg5 58. Kf2 Qd5 59. Re3e4 Qf7+ 60. Kg1 Nf3+ 61. Kg2 Qf6 62. Re4e3 Nh4+ 63. Kg1 Qg5 64. Kf2 Qf4+ 65. Kg1 Nf3+ 66. Kg2 {At this point I offered a draw once again. The white king has little choice but black has not enough material to conclude.} Nd2 {To avoid 3 times repetition, black has to change his tactic, enabling king Arthur to escape. } 67. Ne4 Qf1+ 68. Kg3 Qg1+ 69. Kf4 {Now, the white king has good chances to attain the center and be able to support the passed pawn.} Qf1+ 70. Kg3 Qg1+ 71. Kf4 Nxe4 {Poor Perceval dies on his king's side, slain by the black knight !  I think that the exchange is in white's favour because black has only one piece which means that the mate is not possible without the king and that he cannot trade one piece against another.} 72. Kxe4 Qh1+ 73. Ke5 {The bold king Arthur rushes forward, beeing now at the head of his army.} Qf1 74. Kd5 Qf5+ 75. Kc6 {Menacing the b pawn and enabling a further d5} Qb5+ 76. Kb7 Qa5 {White has now the advantage but the game will last 32 more moves} 77. c4 {preparing d5} Qb4 78. d5 Qxc4 {According to GK computer, it's a mistake. b5 would have been better.} 79. d6 {Now white has definitely the advantage.} Qd5+ {Now we go for another chase : Within the next 15 moves, the poor Arthur moves 13 times.} 80. Kc7 Qc5+ 81. Kd7 b5 82. Re3e6 {At least, Arthur doesn't have to stay and protect the d heroïc footman} Qa7+ 83. Kc6 {My plan is now to slay the b and c black soldiers and, once the menace is eliminated, to bring the king on the e file, so that he can grant a tittle to the brave d soldier.} Qa8+ 84. Kb6 Qb8+ 85. Kxa6 Qa8+ 86. Kxb5 Qb7+ {Now, king Arthur in expedition toward e file.} 87. Kc5 Qa7+ 88. Kd5 Qa5+ 89. Kc6 Qa6+ 90. Kd7 Qb7+ 91. Kd8 Qb8+ 92. Ke7 {Mission accomplished.} Qf8+ 93. Kd7 Qf5 94. Re2e5 {White needs 2 moves without being set in check.} Qxh3 {Blunder, Black is doomed : 94. ... Qf4 would have been better, enabling a further check whatever white plays. } 95. Ke8 Qa3 96. Re6e7+ {If 96. d7, 96. ... Qf8+mate} Kg8 97. d7 {Arthur is blocked but his proud footman will protect him.} Qa4 {The only move to prevent 98. d8} 98. Rf7 {White will have to sacrifice a rook.} Qa8+ {Black has nothing else to play to avoid 99. Re7 with further mate by Rg7 etc.} 99. d8=Q {Last trading sequence.} Qxd8+ 100. Kxd8 Kxf7 101. Re7+ Kf6 102. Rxh7 {GK computer considers it as a blunder, there was a quicker mate.} g5 {The black pawn is more advanced. White will have to sacrifice the rook.} 103.
