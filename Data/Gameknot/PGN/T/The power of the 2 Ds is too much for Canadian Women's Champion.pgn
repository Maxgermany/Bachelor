1. e4 c5 {In a recent tournament, I was up against a WIM and FIDE Master, who is also the Canadian Women's Champion.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {I wasn't very familiar with this variation of the Sicilian, and honestly had no idea what I was doing in the opening.} 6. Bg5 {All I remember about this variation is playing Bg5 followed by Qd2 and long castling.} e6 7. Qd2 a6 8. O-O-O Bd7 9. f4 {This starts a kingside attack and also prevents the annoying ... Ne5} b5 10. Nxc6 Bxc6 11. e5 {I opted for this series of exchanges, which is more favourable for Black, who is behind in development.} dxe5 12. Qxd8+ Rxd8 13. Rxd8+ Kxd8 14. fxe5 h6 15. Be3 {I wanted to keep the bishop pair for the endgame.} Nd7 16. Bd4 g6 {Black could have played a bit more aggressively here with either 16. ... b4 or ... h5 } 17. a4 b4 18. Na2 a5 19. Bb5 {Here, Black is better after either 19. ... Bxb5 or ... Kc7 with White's Knight trapped on a2.} Bxg2 {This gives White a strong attack} 20. Rd1 {Threatening Bb6+ which wins the knight} Bd5 {Black needed to move her King from the d-file here with 20. ... Kc7 or ... Kc8, but this next move gives White a big advantage.} 21. c4 bxc3 e.p. 22. Nxc3 Rg8 23. Be3 {23. Nxd5 exd5 24. Bc3 was a strong alternative} Kc7 24. Nxd5+ {White also had the option of sacrificing the exchange here with 24. Rxd5 with ample compensation} exd5 25. Rxd5 Nb6 26. Rd3 Bg7 {Here, White can ignore the threat on e5 and counterattack with 27. Rd6, which would push Black into the edge of the board.} 27. Bf4 Kb7 28. Rd6 Rc8+ 29. Kb1 Bf8 30. Rf6 Rc7 31. e6 {White crashes through} Nd5 32. Bxc7 Nxf6 33. Bd8 {After this forced sequence of moves, White has a winning endgame.} Nd5 34. exf7 {This pawn will be decisive.} Nc7 35. Bd7 {The Black King has been cut off as in the 2-bishop + King vs King checkmate} Kb6 {The King cannot be activated through c5 without losing the knight.} 36. Kc2 Kb7 37. Kd3 Na6 38. Kc4 Nc5 39. Bb5 Ne4 {Threatening to fork} 40. Kd5 Ng5 41. Be8 Ka6 42. h4 Nh7 43. Bb5+ Kb7 44. Bxa5 {44. Bd3 was even stronger.} Be7 45. h5 {Here 44. Bd2 or Bd3 would have led to a quicker win} gxh5 46. Ke6 Bf8 47. Bd8 Ng5+ 48. Kf6 Ne4+ 49. Kg6 Nd6 50. Be8 Kc8 51. Bf6 h4 52. Bxh4 Ne4 53. Kh7 Nc5 54. Kg8 Ne6 55. Bb5 Bc5 56. Bc4 Nf8 57. Bf6 h5 58. Bg7 Ng6 59. Kh7 {Avoiding the immediate Queening} Nf8+ 60. Bxf8 Bxf8 61. Kg8 {No more tricks}
