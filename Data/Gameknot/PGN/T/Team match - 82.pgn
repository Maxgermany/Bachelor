1. d4 Nc6 2. e4 Nf6 3. e5 Ne4 4. Bd3 f5 5. exf6 e.p. d5 {I gain a pawn advantage because Black can't recapture due to having to protect the knight.} 6. fxe7 Qxe7 {Exchange of pawns.} 7. Nf3 Nb4 8. a3 Nf6+ 9. Be3 Nxd3+ 10. Qxd3 Qb4+ {This was a bad move on Black's part; now I get the queen.} 11. axb4 Bxb4+ 12. c3 Bd6 13. Nbd2 g6 14. Qb5+ c6 15. Qd3 Bf5 16. Qe2 Ne4 17. Nxe4 dxe4 {Exchange of knights.} 18. Ng5 h6 19. Nh3 {The only safe place for my knight to move.} h5 20. Ng5 {Now my knight can move back up to where it was.} Be7 21. O-O O-O 22. Qc4+ {Thus begins my forced checkmate.} Kg7 23. Ne6+ {I think in this instance, black should have taken the knight with the bishop. White would have recaptured, but black wouldn't have lost a rook.} Kg8 24. Nxf8+ {Taking the rook.} Kxf8 25. Bh6+ Ke8 26. Qg8+ {Pinning the rook.} Kd7 27. Qxa8 Kc7 28. Bf4+ Bd6 29. Bxd6+ Kxd6 {Exchanging the bishops.} 30. Qxb7 Be6 {Not really sure why black made this move. Maybe he was trying to open up a path for his bishop to be able to move more freely.} 31. Qb4+ Kd5 32. Qc5# {Mate. I think castling kingside and losing the queen were two of Black's big mistakes in this game. The Queen is self-explanatory, but in move 21, when black castle kingside rather than queenside, it put the king within range of my queen to check him. From move 22 onward, it's a string of my checking the king in various ways to either gain a piece or force his move. If Black had castled queenside instead on move 21, I wouldn't have been able to force a mate so easily.}
