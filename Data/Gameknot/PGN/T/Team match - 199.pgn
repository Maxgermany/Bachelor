1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Bc5 {Three knights game.} 4. d3 {Bc4 is the most common response here--d3 appears to give black an advantage according to the database tree.} Nf6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 7. Nd5 Qe6 {Blunder.  Black could hardly have chose a more disastrous position to place the queen.  Nothing is guarding Pc7 against Nxc7+, followed by NxQ.  Black should have moved either Qd8 or Qd6.} 8. Nxc7+ Ke7 9. Nxe6 Kxe6 10. g3 d5 11. Nh4 g5 12. Bh3+ Kf6 13. Qf3+ Kg7 14. Bxc8 Raxc8 15. Nf5+ Kh7 16. Qh5 Kg8 17. Nxh6+ Rxh6 {While Kf8 would result in Qxf7#, trading the rook for the knight is not necessarily the best move.  Kg7 looks better at first glance.} 18. Qxg5+ {Mistake.  The rook is far more valuable than the pawn.} Rg6 19. Qf5 Rd8 20. h4 dxe4 21. Qxe4 Rf6 22. f3 Nd4 {White should defend against the same move it made against black on move eight.} 23. O-O-O {This of course does not prevent Rxf3.} Nxf3 {...or Nxf3.  I kind of like Rxf3 better as it preservers Ne2+, provided the queen can be lured away from protecting that square.} 24. Qxb7 Bd4 {Be3+ drives the king further into a corner, and permits Nd2+, though the black knight's range of motion remains restricted by white's rooks.} 25. Qe7 Rfd6 {I like Rdd6 better.  While the queen can push the black king around, this lets the black rooks roam the entire field instead of just the d file.} 26. Qb7 {This seems like a mistake.  Rb6 encourages 27. Qxa7, Bxb2+.  The white king must respond with Kb1, in which case black responds with Bd4+, and the white queen falls.  The white queen has to move to some white square invisible to the black bishop, or a black square it cannot cover from b2 in one move.  This makes black's Bd4 a pretty good move in hindsight.  On the other hand, instead of Qxa7 white is probably eying Nf3.  Black should drive the white king into the corner with the bishop and knight combo.} Rd8d7 27. Qxf3 Rb6 {While this may meet black's immediate goal, black should ask himself what white's next move might be besides simply taking the knight.  Rd7 is undefended with this move, and Qg4+ relieves black of an important rook.} 28. c3 {Without a threat to the queen Rb6 was easily defended against.} Bc5 {Much better would be Rc7.  This protects against PxBd4 because of discovered check by the rook, while protecting the rook from Qg4+.} 29. Qg4+ Kf8 30. Qxd7 Be3+ 31. Kc2 Rf6 32. Qd8+ Kg7 33. Qe7 Rf2+ 34. Kb3 Rf5 35. g4 Rf6 36. Qxe5 Bf4 37. Qd4 Kg6 38. Qxf6+ {White white can afford to trade a queen for a rook, this move seems brash.  White has not moved a rook since castling.  White should be able to force a rook trade.} Kxf6 39. Rhf1 Ke5 40. Rde1+ Kd5 41. Rxf4 f6 42. Rxf6 Kc5 43. Re5# {In hindsight, the queen/rook trade brought a quick resolution.  White essentially does not move a rook the first 38 moves (provided castling doesn't count), then makes five simple rook moves in succession.  Precision march of the rooks.  Poetry.}
