1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {I think it's called the Vienna game} Nf6 3. Bc4 {Nothing exciting so far...} Nxe4 {fork trick...} 4. Qh5 {Qh7?!! aha... trying a version of Scholar's mate? not quite...} Nd6 {and we are almost in the middle of the Frankenstein-Dracula -the white bishop is attacked} 5. Bb3 {protect the bishop} Nc6 {defend the pawn} 6. Nb5 {deflecting the black knight to prepare for checkmate} g6 7. Qf3 {keeping the attack} f5 {blocking checkmate} 8. Qd5 {threatening checkmate again... is this crazy or what?} Qe7 {this might seem like an extremely horrible blunder} 9. Nxc7+ Kd8 10. Nxa8 {it's not really, though, as you'll soon see} b6 11. d3 {who cares about a knight? white is behind in development} Bb7 12. h4 {development and attacking is worth more than saving 1 point with Nb6- white threatens Bg5 and he is going to castle queenside-as you'll see white will develop safely and win} f4 13. Qf3 Nd4 14. Qg4 {white wants a queen trade} Bg7 15. Bd2 Bxa8 {Hmm...} 16. O-O-O Bf6 17. Kb1 Qg7 {king safety} 18. Re1 h5 19. Qh3 Nd6f5 {Nothing much here } 20. Ne2 {trade!!!!!} Nxe2 21. Rxe2 Nxh4 {only 1 point behind, but...} 22. g3 {if bxh1 Qxh1 threats: Qa8+ and gxh4} Nf3 {save the knight threat:nxd2 rxd2 bxh1 qxh1 only one threat and black can just deal with Qa8 easily;it's his turn} 23. Bc3 Ng5 {attack the queen and rook} 24. Qh2 Bxh1 25. gxf4 {whoa this is really neat if exf4 Qxf4 threats Qb8# and bxf6+} Bf3 {attack the rook} 26. fxe5 {oh very good! comment your analysis see if you can figure it out:)} Qf8 {Better than Be2...} 27. exf6 {Qb8#} Qc5 {safe-?not quite} 28. Re5 Qc7 29. Qf4 {black resigns}
