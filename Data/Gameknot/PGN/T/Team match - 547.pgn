1. e4 {This is a game which looks quiet at the end of the opening but ends in a devastating pawn attack and rook sacrifice} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. dxc3 {Doesn't look very promising tactically at this stage!} Be7 7. Bf4 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O {Throws down the gauntlet. Black is going to have to resist a pawn surge} Bf5 {Putting the bishops in front of the pawns is not a good idea} 10. Rg1 Bf6 11. g4 Bg6 12. h4 Qd7 {This leaves the possibility of Ne5 with the d pawn pinned in some variations} 13. h5 Be4 14. Be2 {white will happily swap knight for bishop} Rfe8 {trying to get some counterplay but weakening the f pawn} 15. g5 Be5 16. g6 {now the pawn surge has arrived. Black is in big trouble. 16....hxg6. 17hxg6 Bxg6 18Bc4 is good for white} Bxf4 17. Qxf4 hxg6 18. hxg6 Bxg6 19. Rxg6 {devastating... If 19....fxg6 then 20 bc4+} Rxe2 {stops Bc4 but the next move is a killer} 20. Rxg7+ {20...Kf8. 21Qg5 and mate or major loss of material soon follows} Kxg7 21. Qg5+ Kf8 22. Rh1 {The quiet but devasting move. Mate follows very soon} f6 23. Qxf6+ {}
