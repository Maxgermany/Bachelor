[Round "1"]
[White "Euwe "]
[Black "Abrahams "]
[Opening "Polish defence (A40)"]

1. d4 b5 {This move lets Euwe establish a powerful central presence.} 2. e4 Bb7 3. f3 {The fianchettoed B "bites on granite", and White is already severely constricting Black's game.} a6 {Another flank move, which does nothing to support the center.} 4. c4 {This forces Abrahams to react. He cannot let Euwe have four all-powerful central Pawns.} bxc4 {Removing one of the Pawns, but opening up lines of attack.} 5. Bxc4 {6 Q-N3 is now threatened.} e6 {Blocking the immediate threat, but doing nothing to improve his position.} 6. Nc3 {Adding more fuel to the fire.} d5 {Abrahams finally fights for a piece of the center. But it is too little, too late.} 7. Qb3 {7... PxB is now countered with 8 QxB N-Q2 9 Q-B6 winning at least a Pawn.} Nc6 {Hoping for 8 QxB??, which loses a piece [8... N-R4 9 B-N5 ch K-K2 10 NxP ch PxN, and White's Q and B are both attacked.]} 8. exd5 {Now threatening P-Q6 at the appropriate time.} Nxd4 {The alternative is 8... N-R4, and after 9 Q-R4 ch P-B3 10 PxKP, the only person who would like Black's position is an archaeologist, as it is in ruins.} 9. Qxb7 {Wins a piece outright.} Rb8 {Desperation. Now another Pawn falls.} 10. Qxa6 {Black could easily resign now.} Ra8 {A spite move, attacking the Queen uselessly.} 11. Bb5+ {Turning up the heat.} Ke7 {The only other choice, equally hopeless, was ... P-B3.} 12. d6+ {Black resigns. If 12... PxP, 13 B-N5 ch P-B3 14 Q-N7 ch and mate in 1. If instead 12...QxP, 13 QxR N-B7 ch 14 K-B1 NxR 15 B-N5 ch!! Any 16 Q-K8 mate.}
