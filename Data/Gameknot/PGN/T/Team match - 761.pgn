1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bg4 {this is not a good move. better is to stick to theory and play e6.} 5. Bxc4 e6 6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 {now, b7 is a weak square.} c6 {apparently there is no better choice. the last move is eliminating good place for the Knight.} 8. O-O Be7 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Rd1 {white has a lot of space to play in. black is a little "squeezed".} Nbd7 11. e4 {attack! free the c1 Bishop and get a good grip of the center.} Nb6 12. Be2 {in my opinion, Bb3 was a bit better because of the pressure on e6 and f7.} Qc7 {trying to develope the rook...} 13. Bf4 {it seems that c7 was not a good place for the queen...} Qd7 14. a4 {right! black must find a good place for his b6 Knight, or play a5 and weakening his queenside.} Rad8 15. a5 Nc8 16. Rac1 {the files d ad c are totally white...} Bb4 17. Bg5 Be7 18. a6 {a very nice move. the idea is to break pawn structure in black's queen side.} b5 19. Bf4 Nb6 20. Qg3 g6 21. Bc7 Nc4 {?? was black affraid of Bxb6? I think that it was better to exchange pieces instead of loosing the rook (even though the a pawn is becoming a pain in the ...).} 22. Bxd8 Rxd8 23. Bxc4 bxc4 24. Qe5 {getting the queen to the queen side, the obvious advantage of White's position.} Rb8 {?????????} 25. Qxb8+ {}
