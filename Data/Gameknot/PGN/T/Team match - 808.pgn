1. e4 {Standard opening.} e5 2. Qh5 {It looked to me that he was going for a quick kill.} Nc6 {I took a chance and continued to develop...the worst I could lose is the ability to castle.} 3. Bc4 {Consistent with "Scholar's Mate."} g6 {Threaten the Queen and see what he does.} 4. Qf3 {Backed off but the situation is still fluid.  He can come back with the Queen or Bishop.} Nf6 {But normal development partly protects me at this point.} 5. b3 d5 6. exd5 Nd4 {I chose a bolder move than normal to test his resolve.} 7. Qd1 {He backs up to home.} Bg4 {This was my first mistake since it gives me no real advantage and allowed him to continue development.} 8. f3 Bh6 {I cannot even tell you why I made this move.  A normal fianchetto would have been preferable.} 9. fxg4 {And I give up a powerful piece for nothing.  I should have backed off.} Ne4 {For some reason I become ultra aggressive.} 10. c3 Nf2 11. Kxf2 {Probably to prevent him from being able to castle.} Qf6+ {All of this movement results in arrested development, the loss of two power pieces and no significant advantage.  He cannot castle but I cannot claim any advantage.} 12. Ke1 O-O {Instead of moving my knight back to a safe position I castle, but at this point I have handed him a significant advantage.   In retrospect this was the one GOOD thing I did which will be vindicated later.} 13. cxd4 {Loss of 2nd knight and nothing is gained.  I could not have moved the knight to safety but I could have moved it to a place where its loss would have been productive.} Rae8 {Trying to consolidate what I have left and see a strategy which will result in something good.} 14. d3 {Does he recognize the really bad situation I am in?} exd4+ {Finally turned the tide of loses but the check is incidental.} 15. Ne2 g5 {To stop the pawn at g5 from advancing and protect my remaining bishop.} 16. Nd2 a6 17. Bb2 b5 {Putting pressure on his flank and trying to slow his momentum by giving him something else to think about.} 18. Bxd4 {Threat to the Queen which I cannot afford to lose at this point.} Qd6 {This part of the game seems to be a little aimless.  I cannot attack and he chooses not to.} 19. Ne4 Qg6 {If he had decided to assert continuous pressure at this point he would have won the game easily.} 20. Bxb5 axb5 {The loss of the bishop is crucial since nothing it was threatening my Rook at e8.} 21. a4 b4 {Certainly a delaying move since I had no idea the pawn on b4 would ever play a role in the end game.} 22. Nf6+ {Finally !!} Kg7 {Totally defensive.} 23. Nxe8+ Kg8 {Should have taken the knight since it would have removed a piece and pinned his other knight for a little while.} 24. Nxc7 Rd8 {Reduce his options for use of the Knight.} 25. Qd2 Qd6 26. Rc1 {He is protecting the knight from my Queen.} Rc8 27. Bc5 {First mistake he made of a major nature by shielding his Rook.} Qxc7 28. Nd4 {Should have moved the bishop and exposed my last 2 major pieces.  I would have lost one of them.} Re8+ {Check and he chooses to loose the ability to castle.  I would have done the same.  No need to sacrifice the Queen because I would have taken it.} 29. Kf1 Qxc5 {I cannot tell you why I did this and I cannot tell you why he did not take the Queen.  Should have moved out of immediate danger.} 30. Nf5 Qb6 {Finally moved the Queen out of danger but I should taken the pawn.} 31. d6 Qd8 {Now we have an interesting situation because momentum is shifting and his king is exposed.} 32. Nxh6+ {Lose my last bishop and  experience check again.} Kg7 33. Nf5+ Kg6 {I decide to become agressive since my circumstance is so desparate.} 34. Ng3 {His second major mistake.  I  cannot take his knight and it is easily protected.} Qf6+ {Check} 35. Nf5 h6 {Considered resigning for a while.} 36. Qxb4 {Third major mistake.  The Queen threatens nothing from this location but it does protect his back row from attack from my Queen and the pawn he hopes to promote at d6.} Qe6 {I decide I have nothing else to lose and consider attack on his King with my Queen.} 37. Rc6 {Fourth major mistake and worst one.  I cannot see any reason to move the Rook to c6 and it open up his back row.  The game completely turns at this point.} Qe2+ {Check and his King has only one move.} 38. Kg1 Qd1+ 39. Kf2 {His only move.} Re2+ {This was the critical risk.  His inability to castle comes home to cripple him.} 40. Kf3 {I considered taking his Rook but realized my only chance was relentless pressure on his King.  Make him make a mistake.} Qxd3+ 41. Ne3 {Last futile gesture.} Qxe3# {Look at the disparity in pieces and material.  This game was lost.  I almost resigned several times but I prepared for an opportunity under duress and it paid off.}
