1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Another game played in the Annotation Project and luckily another Relief Sighing Victory for me!  I follow Freddy's game against himself but then my opponent deviates and although I rustle up an attack it only reduced a 5 point deficit down to 2 but with pieces exchanged.  How was I gonna avoid a 15-16 point loss here?  Answer, my opponent blundered his queen giving me a 6 point material lead.  Yodean immediately waved the white flag and I ended up with a 5 point gain and my highest chessic rating so far, 1794, just 6 points shy of 1800.  The action will be picked up on move 8 when black chose c7 for his king.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 {8. ...... Kc7 - here black chooses Kc7 and it looks as if it is gonna be like the Freddy game.} 9. Bxg4 Qe8 10. Ne6+ Kb6 {10. ...... Kb6 - very standard and still following the Freddy game.  I follow it until move 12 when .....} 11. Nc3 Na6 12. d4 exd3 e.p. {12. ....... exd3 e.p - the other pawn capture was cxd4 but this one is gonna be a headache.  Nevertheless I try and put the pressure on.} 13. Nd5+ Kc6 14. Bf3 {14. Bf3 - more pressure.} Kd7 15. f5 dxc2 {15. ..... dxc2 - this makes me 5 points down on material - ghastly!} 16. Bf4 {16. Bf4 - must develop my remaining wood very quickly keeping my ecclesiastical twins Leblanc and Lenoir close to the enemy king.} g5 17. Be5 Rg8 {17. ...... Rg8 - the black rook evades capture.} 18. Be4 Qh5 19. Bxc2 {19. Bxc2 - I get rid of nuisance c pawn and close the gap to -4.} Rc8 20. Rd1 Ke8 {20.  ....... Ke8 - averting a nasty discovery that would certainly snare the Wicked Witch next move.} 21. Ba4+ Kf7 22. O-O {22. 0-0 - the Wicked Witch has some nasty checks up her sleeve, Henry must be tucked away.  At least the rooks are connected and my f1 rook stands on the same file as the enemy king.} Qe2 23. Bd7 Qxe5 24. Bxc8 {24. Bxc8 - this trade - Fou Lenoir for black's queen rook narrows the deficit down to -2 but vital wood has left the board.} Qxb2 25. Nd8+ Ke8 26. Nxb7 {26. Nxb7 - keeps the deficit down to -2 but now something unbelievable happens ......} Qxg2+ 27. Kxg2 {27. Kxg2 - yup, black blunders his queen and then waves the white flag.  If black had not blundered his queen I feel I would have been extremely lucky to get away with a Low Draw, otherwise I feared I would lose 16 points as stated in my introductory note.  This win gives me 7 point out of 10 games in this mini-tourney.  Not bad at the half-way stage, let's hope I can hold things together in my remaining games.  Do you the jury feel that taking that pawn en passant was an improvement on Freddy's game.  I will be very interested to hear your views.  Hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now.  Joanne}
