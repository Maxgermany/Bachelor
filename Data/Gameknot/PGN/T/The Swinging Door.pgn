1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 {Queens Gambit} e6 3. Nc3 {If black doesnt hit d5 I aiming to push to d5 with the intention of 4.e4 } d5 {Preventing my d5 advance.  } 4. a3 {Queens pawn game - purely defensive at this stage as I wanted to keep my knight active and didnt want a pin from his bishop, I know this move is quite common on gameknot at this level of play, I see it as a slow move, but Im happy to play it at present. Maybe better was 4.Nf3 or even e3 clearing the diagonal to develop my bishop while also protecting d4. } Nc6 {Developing his knights into the centre} 5. Bf4 {Developing and aiming for 6.Nb5 and achieve with 7.Nc7  fork and winning the rook} Bd6 {There goes that plan...looking at my options, I dont think a trade will benefit me after looking at blacks pawn structure thus far, this is my good bishop, so even though I'll be behind in moves, backing away is the best option. Time to change my plan.} 6. Bd2 {moving back to d2 instead of e3 was to prevent moving my bishop again if black advanced by knight to g4 and then being another move behind} Nxd4 {hmmm, now Im starting to feel my hold on the centre weakening and with three advanced pieces to my two, I need to start getting my pieces developed} 7. e3 {Forcing the knight off d4 while opening up the diagonals for my bishop and queen} Nc6 8. Nf3 O-O {And he we go...I look at my options and all I can see is the b1 h7 diagonal - thats my winning line, I think to myself If I keep that open, Im in with a good chance. Maybe better for black would have been pushing to e5 starting to get a strong hold in the centre while opening up the diagonal for his bishop. } 9. Bd3 {Ill have that diagonal thank you very much!} dxc4 {losing another pawn in the centre and threatening to get me off that diagonal, I decide to take with the intention to get back on the diagonal.} 10. Bxc4 a6 {Preventing the advancing of my knight, but Ive got a plan to offer some bait that will eventuate with black losing his rook with 11.Qa4 b5 12.Bxb5 axb5 13.Qxa1. } 11. Qa4 {I try out my plan} Bd7 {hmmm, no good, time to retreat, maybe another wasted move and showing my lack of analyzation of the board, getting too excited and not enough thinking it through} 12. Qc2 {Retreat to my much sort after diagonal} Ne5 {Im feeling a bit cramped at the moment and with the current closed game, I think trading knights is the right option plus I need to preserve my c4 bishop, removing the knight will give me some reprieve} 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14. Ne2 {Seeing Im going no where fast on the queen side, time to hit the rest button and stick with my plan to hit the kingside, the side I should have been trying to develop all along} Bc6 {Possibly seeing my weak hold on b1 h7 and trying to steal it, but also aiming at my h1 rook} 15. Rg1 Qd7 16. O-O-O {I know that queenside castling may be dangerous, but I could see an opportunity to get a move back with a revealed threat on his Queen and also claim the soon to be open d file } b5 {retreat...again} 17. Bd3 {But now Im loaded up on the diagonal, I just have to get rid of that knight protecting h7} a5 18. f4 {out the way please...} Bd6 {much appreciated} 19. g4 {Now I see the benefits of move 15. one more push and the knight is out of there } b4 {Not too worried about that, however I can see me being in trouble if he hits a4 with his bishop and if I push my pawn to b3, he gets a passed pawn and looking dangerous for advancement! But I can see my opportunity, Ive got my plan and Im going for it...} 20. g5 {Excuse me, but can you please move} Nd5 {Thank you.} 21. Bxh7+ {Excuse me King, but could you please move to h8} Kh8 {Thank you} 22. Rg3 {Aiming at h3 and Ill have myself a swinging door} e5 {Preventing 23.Rh3, I have to do something about that queen} 23. Bf5 {Excuse me, but we need to clear this diagonal, either move it or lose it} Qd8 {Thank you...now to h3} 24. Rh3+ {Back to g8 thanks} Kg8 25. Bh7+ {Sorry to hassle you around, but I need you back on h8, would you be so kind...} Kh8 {Thanks for that} 26. Bg8+ {!The door swings with a revealed check on the king and now the diagonal is open for my queen to deliver the final blow.} Kxg8 27. Qh7# {Hope you enjoyed, I know I did...not the best technically proficient game, but it does show that sticking to a plan and preserving pieces required to bring about the plan is critical. }
