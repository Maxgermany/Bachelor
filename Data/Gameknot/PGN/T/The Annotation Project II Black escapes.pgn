Ne6 Qg8 {Still following the main line.} 11. Nc3 {one variation the stronger might be d4} Na6 {Probably Bxc3 should have been played White should Play Nxe4 taking the center by storm.} 12. a3 Bxc3 13. bxc3 {Strange but has the up side of opening up the b-file for the rook.} Nc5 14. Nxc5 Kxc5 15. O-O Rd8 16. a4 {Here I should have played a6} h5 17. Be2 {Again a6 could be played here.} Qe6 18. Ba3+ Kc6 19. Bb5+ {Kb6 Rb1 didn't feel good.} Kd5 20. c4+ Kd4 {Forcing the king forward.  I felt Joanne may have had something after c3+ Kd3 c5+ but who knows.
