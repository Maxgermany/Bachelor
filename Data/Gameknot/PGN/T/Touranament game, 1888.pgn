1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 {The struggle for occupation of the center by Pawns starts at once.} 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Bd3 cxd4 {After this White is able to maintain his center Pawns but only with some loss of time, showing that 6 B-K2 would have been better. His Q Pawn, however, becomes permanently backward.} 7. cxd4 Bd7 {Not 7... NxP 8 NxN QxN 9 B-N5 ch. But now the threat to the Q pawn is very real.} 8. Be2 Nge7 9. b3 Nf5 10. Bb2 Bb4+ 11. Kf1 {The price White has to pay for the defence of his center Pawns is loss of the right to castle, since a Knight on either Q2 or QB3 would cut off one of the defences of the Q Pawn.} Be7 {The Bishop has performed one task and now retires in order to solidify Black's game. White's N-N5 is prevented, while his P-KN4 can now be answered with N-R5.} 12. g3 a5 {Threatening to destroy White's Q side with P-R5, thus revealing another weakness which has sprung from the defence of the Q Pawn.} 13. a4 Rc8 14. Bb5 Nb4 {Avoiding the dangers of 14... O-O 15 B-Q3, with concealed pressure on Black's KR Pawn.} 15. Bxd7+ {Black now has the initiative, for if White plays the natural looking 15 N-B3, Black continues 15... BxB 16 NxB N-B7 threatening N-K6 ch.} Kxd7 16. Nc3 Nc6 {From this point on White is made to feel the weakness of his Q Pawn. Here Black makes use of it in order to clear the QB file for his Rooks.} 17. Nb5 Na7 18. Nxa7 Qxa7 19. Qd3 {Black threatened with ...Q-R3 ch to put pressure on the white squares which would have left White deplorably short of moves.} Qa6 {At the cost of doubling his Rook's Pawns, he exposes the white QN pawn to attack and asserts his control over the only open file.} 20. Qxa6 bxa6 21. Kg2 Rc2 22. Bc1 {Not B-R3 because of 22... BxB 23 RxB N-K6ch 24 K-R3 RxP.} Rb8 23. Rb1 Rc3 24. Bd2 Rcxb3 25. Rxb3 Rxb3 26. Bxa5 Rb2 {Black has eliminated his weakness in the Q side Pawns and now threatens N-K6 ch again. The text move is stronger than R-R6 at once, when White could reply 27 R-QN1 with an open file for his own Rook. If now 27 R-QB1 N-K6 ch 28 K-N1 N-B5.} 27. Bd2 Bb4 {Not ...NxQP [hoping for 28 NxN RxB] because of 28 B-B3.} 28. Bf4 h6 {Preparing P-N4 with a general restriction of White's game.} 29. g4 Ne7 30. Ra1 Nc6 31. Bc1 Rc2 32. Ba3 Rc4 {The renewed threat to the Q Pawn now restricts White still further.} 33. Bb2 Bc3 34. Bxc3 Rxc3 35. Rb1 {He has no way of avoiding the forking of two pawns by ...R-B5.} Kc7 36. g5 {Fighting against the threatened slow death, he tries to free his game. A possible continuation would be 36... P-KR4 37 P-N6 PxP 38 N-N3 NxQP 39 R-Q1 R-B5 40 RxN RxR 41 NxP ch, winning, so it can be seen that White's bid for freedom is not entirely without teeth.} Rc4 37. gxh6 gxh6 38. a5 {The doomed Pawn is to be given up in the best possible way. If now 38... NxRP 39 R-R1 K-N3 40 R-N1 ch K-R2 and Black's King is out of play.} Ra4 39. Kg3 Rxa5 40. Kg4 Ra3 41. Rd1 {To free his Knight from the defence of the Q Pawn, and so allow his King to advance on the weakened black Pawns.} Rb3 42. h4 Ne7 43. Ne1 Nf5 {Now the K side Pawns are supported and the threat to White's Q Pawn in no way diminished.} 44. Nd3 a5 {Not ...NxP 45 N-B5 R-N4 46 NxRP ch.} 45. Nc5 Rc3 46. Rb1 {Faced with an impending loss owing to the adance of the QR Pawn, he gives up any further attempt to hold the Q Pawn and plays solely for a desperate counter-attack.} Nxd4 47. Na6+ Kd8 48. Rb8+ Rc8 {Not ...K-K2 49 R-N7 ch K-B1 50 N-B7, threatening 51 R-N8 ch K-N2 52 N-K8 ch K-N3 53 P-R5 ch K-R2 54 N-B6 ch K-N2 55 R-N8 mate.} 49. Rb7 Ke8 50. Nc7+ Kf8 51. Nb5 {Conceding that Black's defences have held, for if 51 K-R5 N-B4 52 K-N5 R-B5 threatening ...RxP mate.} Nxb5 52. Rxb5 Ra8 53. f4 a4 54. Rb1 a3 55. f5 a2 56. Ra1 Ra4+ 57. Kh5 Kg7 58. fxe6 fxe6 59. Rg1+ Kh8 60. Ra1 Kh7 {Showing the neat timing of his previous move.} 61. Rg1 {A last desperate trap...} a1=Q 62. Rg7+ Kh8 {...which Black avoids. KxR would be stalemate. White resigns.}
