[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 2. e3 {Stonewall attack.} e6 3. b3 {Nf3 is decent.  This move is off book.} Bb4+ 4. Bd2 a5 5. c3 Be7 6. b4 axb4 7. Qa4+ {Whoa!  RxQ4 makes this a horrible move.} c6 {Oops.} 8. Qxa8 Qc7 9. Qa4 Na6 10. Bxa6 bxa6 11. cxb4 Qb7 12. Ne2 Bd7 13. Bc3 Nf6 14. Nd2 c5 {Black exposes a threat to the white queen.} 15. dxc5 {Which white ignores.} Bxa4 {Black does not let pass this second opportunity.} 16. O-O Qc6 17. Bxf6 Bxf6 18. Rab1 h5 19. f4 Bb5 20. Rbe1 h4 21. a3 h3 22. g3 Rh6 {Pd4 sets up a quick checkmate.  Easily parried, but an interesting move.} 23. Nf3 Qd6 {?} 24. cxd6 Kd7 25. Ne5+ Kxd6 {Ouch!  White is encouraged to move NxPf7+, followed by leaping onto the rook.} 26. Nxf7+ Ke7 27. Nxh6 gxh6 28. Rf2 h5 29. Rc1 {Nope.  Bb2 gives black a pawn.} h4 30. Rc7+ Kd6 31. Rh7 Bb2 32. Rxh4 Bf6 {BxPa3 would probably have been better.  White wants to play RxPh3, which Bf6 encourages.} 33. Rxh3 Bb2 34. Rh6 Bd7 35. f5 Kc6 {That doesn't help Pe6.  To save Pa3 white can play Nd4+, followed by Nc2.  Black's black bishop will be blind to the knight on the white square.  But PxPe6 is free. } 36. f6 {PxPe6 would have been better.  Black would have to move the bishop to the eighth rank, though against two white rooks the conclusion is largely foregone, barring blunder. } Kd6 37. Rh7 Be8 {Pf7 still works.} 38. f7 Ke7 {Pf8=Q+.  There is a rook at f2 protecting this pawn.} 39. f8=Q+ Kd8 40. Qd6+ {...or Ke7+, followed by QxBe8#.  Bigger point spread.  Though that is truly irrelevant.  I mention QxBe8# because many of Shosanna's victories are by the queen trapping the opposing king against the wall, and I would like to see a broader repertoire, especially if it reduces the number of moves.  She is my team mate, and sister-in-law, just to explain my interest in her progress.  } Kc8 41. Qc7# {}
