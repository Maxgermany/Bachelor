1. e4 c5 {e5 might have been better} 2. Nf3 {Setting up to open the centre early} Nc6 3. d4 {Forcing by taking contol of the centre} cxd4 {hoped for} 4. Nxd4 {if no exchange on d4, I would play Bc4 or Nc3} Nxd4 {opening up} 5. Qxd4 {Centralising my Queen - Now you will note that the black pawns are blocking in all his pieces except the Queen and there has to be pawn movement to open up and develop} e6 6. Nc3 {1-0 minor pieces} Ne7 {Stil 1-0 as his knight now blocks the line that was opened for the queen and bishop - but he was scared of e5 - which would chace the knight around....} 7. Bc4 {2-0 minor pieces} Nc6 8. Qe3 {2-1 minor pieces} b6 9. Nb5 {Here I saw the fianchetto comming, but without a c pawn to anchor it I thought I might try to get the a pawn out or get my Knight in his face - which is always dangerous - and you will see how costly this was} Bb7 10. Qg3 {I wanted to stop Be7 or c5 which would have been nice development for him and- also looking at Nc7 - and this would stop black from castling queen side - while I had the bishop allocated to defence of g7 - there would thus be no castling..... or atleast not without blood loss} Rc8 11. Bf4 {I wanted to force the issue on c7 which he could not further defend - except with a bad move} e5 12. Bxe5 {Going one pawn up - note that untill now white had 3 active minor pieces against a knight that blocked in his bishop and another bishop that has to defend g7} Nxe5 13. Qxe5+ {Up to here I had planned, and I liked what I saw - but then the gift that kept on giving Qe7 - in hind sight Be7 looked worse to me, but it would be less costly......} Qe7 14. Nd6+ {So here we have the windmill!!  Starting with a check and ending in victory!  Note that the King only has D8 & E8 open and as long as I could keep him in check I could clean up around him black can also never take the white queen as every move forces him from one square to another - keeping him in check  I worked it out to find the best combination} Kd8 {Forced} 15. Nxb7+ {Forcing another move} Ke8 16. Nd6+ {forcing} Kd8 17. Nxf7+ {forcing again - I was thinking of Qxe7 Nxh8 to save the brave Knight who won the battle single handedly, but then I saw it would cost me the bishop on c4 whithout whom the knight is caught on the back rank....} Ke8 18. Nd6+ {forced} Kd8 19. Qxe7+ {No more need for the queens} Bxe7 20. Nxc8 {Last turn of the mill} Kxc8 21. Ba6+ {Here my oponent resigned after a brave battle.}
