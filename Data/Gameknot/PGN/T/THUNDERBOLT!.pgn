1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Back again!  This time I am gonna write about Welcome MT Part 9, in which in nearly every game, bar my two with Freddy, Glenda has had something to say.  I mean, she even made Itchy scratch his head (if any of you have read that annotation by Coach Ion while I was away on my vacation).  Anyhow, in this game, Porcho gave me a bit of a headache and for a little while, I was even fearing for Henry's safety as he was stuck in the centre.  Meanwhile, I was also being tied down by his g pawn which was only one square away from queening.  Yup, Porcho certainly showed me why his rating had soared into the 1300s before falling away again - shades of The Dentist methinks!  Things were going swimmingly for Porcho until, after giving him a bone in the throat, he was hit by a thunderbolt from Fou Lenoir.  He also found himself having to reckon with Glenda.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on.......} e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ng5 h6 6. Nxf7 {6. Nxf7 - these moves were set up as a thematic mini-tournament testing out the soundness of the Allgaier Gambit.  How sound it really is will be borne out once all the games are completed.} Kxf7 7. Nc3 {7. Nc3 - this move has been the best of the pick in the World DB.  If that knight can move to d5 it can cause black problems should he try to shelter his king with his knight and then white castles kingside.} f3 8. gxf3 Be7 9. Bc4+ Kg7 10. Qe2 Bxh4+ {10. Bxh4+ - black is doing pretty well here.  He is still 3 points up in material and now Henry must give up the right to castle.} 11. Kd1 g3 {11. ..... g3 - a very dangerous looking passer makes an appearance in my arc.} 12. d3 Nf6 13. e5 {13. e5 - pawn stab.} Nh7 14. f4 {14. f4 - making a little room for Glenda to come to g4 in order to check the BK.} Nc6 15. Qg4+ Kf8 16. Qf5+ {16. Qf5+ - Glenda gets as near to the BK as possible.  Do note that Porcho is now in Old Matey's shadow.} Nf6 17. Rxh4 d5 {17. ..... d5! - a discovered attack on Glenda which forces an exchange of queens in order to maintain restored material parity.} 18. Qxf6+ Qxf6 19. exf6 {19. exf6 - this pawn, although passed, looks really vulnerable.  However, it is this pawn that will say "shamat" to Porcho 13 moves from here.} dxc4 20. Be3 {20. Be3 - I must eschew dxc4? as this could allow Henry to be dangerously exposed to black's rooks and other pieces.  Instead, I must get my pieces out asap.} Rg8 21. Rxh6 {21. Rxh6 - the seeds of a plan are beginning to germinate.  Black naturally pushes his pawn.} g2 22. Kd2 {22. Kd2 - now Henry clears the decks for my rook on a1.} Bg4 23. Rg1 Bf3 {23. ...... Bf3 - black really thought he was sitting pretty here.  I think a lot of the Inquest Jury might prefer black's position.  However, here comes the bone in the throat .......} 24. Rh7 {24. Rh7 - suddenly black is choking on it!} Rc8 {24. ...... Rc8 - black defends his c7 pawn but he is just about to be hit by that thunderbolt!} 25. Bc5+ {25. Bc5+!! - CHEEEECK!  Suddenly, black is in very serious trouble.} Ke8 26. f7+ {26. f7+ - it is a matter of setting conditional moves here.  Suddenly, Glenda is gonna appear!} Kd7 27. fxg8=Q+ {27. fxg8=Q+ - this is a deadly discovered check, firstly swiping one rook and on the next turn swiping the other.  Poor Porcho just does not know what has hit him.} Ne7 28. Rxe7+ Kc6 29. Qxc8 {29. Qxc8 - Glenda really is on the rampage.} Kxc5 {29. ...... Kxc5 - Fou Lenoir perishes, but now Glenda and my rook form a deadly dynamic duo to nail the black king.} 30. Qxc7+ Kd4 31. Qd6+ {31. Qd6+ - I notice after hitting the submit button that I could have delivered mate here by Qe5.  However, mate will come next move because all black can do is block the check with his bishop.  Glenda will swipe it next move and deliver the kiss of death, which she duly does.  A welcome win.  I hope you have all had a good read.  Be back soon.  Bye for now - Joanne} Bd5 32. Qxd5# {}
