[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Bd3 Bxd3 5. Qxd3 e6 {The advance variation if the Caro-Kann defence, leading to slow, positional games. } 6. f4 {An aggressive approach, but perfectly playable. } Qb6 {Developing the queen before the light pieces is generally considered not the best move, but in this position, it has no consequences. The queen pressures d4 and b2, and prepares c5. } 7. c3 {Fortifying the pawn chain. } c5 {The thrust with the c pawn is extremely common in this variation of the Caro-Kann. It assaults the center and helps with the development of Black's pieces. Notice that white has no counter-threats at all. } 8. Nf3 Nc6 9. O-O {Simple development of the pieces. } cxd4 {Relieving pressure in the center, Black loses tension. However, this pawn trade also weakens d4 even further, and opens the c-file for future threats. } 10. cxd4 {Recapturing with the knight would still lead to the same results after further trades. } h5 {The pawn move might seem a bit asbrud and irrational, but Black's position is still solid. This move secures f5 for the black knight, and prevents g4. } 11. Nc3 Nh6 12. h3 Nf5 {The knight is secured in its position. White cannot play g4 because of hxg4, leaving White's king open to attacks along the h-file. The knight also puts pressure on d4. } 13. Rd1 Be7 {Developing the final piece.} 14. g4 {White finally decides to remove the well-positioned black knight. A good move, forcing black into a slightly uncomfortable position. } hxg4 15. hxg4 Nh6 16. g5 {This is a debatable move, since it gives f5 back to the black knight and leaves White's kingside completely deserted. However, it blocks the e7 bishop and increases White's initiative on the kingside. } Nf5 17. Ne2 {Defending g3. } O-O-O {By castling, Black connects the two rooks, and prepares himself for an attack on the kingside. The king is safe, even along the open c-file, since White has not yet fully developed his pieces. } 18. a3 Kb8 19. b4 {White advances on the queenside. However, by putting all of his pawns on black squares, White has hampered the development of the c1 bishop and created multiple weaknesses in his position. At the same time, Black has lost all activity, and is forced to play passively. } Rdc8 {Trying to use the c-file. } 20. Bb2 Rc7 {Attempting to double his rooks in Black's cramped position. } 21. Rac1 a6 22. Nc3 {The knight returns to its post, creating a strong threat of Na4, trapping the queen in the corner of the board. The knight is also headed to c5. } Rcc8 {Creating an escape route for the queen. } 23. Na4 Qd8 24. Kg2 {As White's pieces are moving deeper and deeper into Black's position, White also hopes to play on the h-file. Black is desperate at this point for some counterplay, so he plays...} f6 {... this move. As revealed later, this is a terrible move that does not at all fit into the spirit of the Caro-Kann Defence. It weakens Black's pawn chain, creates multiple weaknesses, and loses the support of e6. White finds a way to successfully open the position, and successfully take advantage of the mistake. } 25. Nc5 {Instantly, the knight jumps onto the strong outpost, and takes advantage of the weak e6. This knight is much stronger than the one on f5. } fxg5 {A complete miscalculation. Of course, the correct response would be Bxc5, immediately getting rid of White's knight. As a result of the two weak moves, Black loses a pawn, and is left in a weak position. } 26. Nxe6 {The correct reply. The knight forks the queen and the pawn on g7, so the queen is forced to move. } Qd7 27. Nfxg5 {White's second knight springs into action, supporting the second. The two White knights are dominating the board, while Black's pieces are passively scattered around. We both missed that the f5 knight is left unprotected. } Bxg5 {Capturing one of the pesky knights, but now it is too late. } 28. Nxg5 g6 {Supporting Black's only fighting piece - the knight on f5. } 29. Rdh1 {After gaining a strong position, White begins the battle for the h-file, which is a major part of Black's defensive position at this point. } Rcf8 {Refusing to trade. However, White trades the rooks himself. } 30. Rxh8 Rxh8 31. Rh1 {White pulls the second rook into battle. There is no threat of capturing h1, since the knight on g5 promptly defends h7 from the Black's queen. Black is left with no choice but to trade rooks. } Rxh1 32. Kxh1 {Let's examine the resulting endgame. White is a pawn up, and has a bishop for a knight, and a passed protected pawn on e5. Black, however, has a weak position and two isolated pawns on d5 and g6. It will take a lot of effort from Black to save the game. } Qe8 {Hoping for some counterplay, starting from Qh8+. White makes an interensing choice. } 33. Qh3 {White finally claims the h-file, but gives up the d4 pawn. White's future moves explain his intention, and the moves that go with it. } Ncxd4 {Grabbing the chance to reclaim material, Black instantly takes back the pawn. However, this gives White an opportunity to finally trade off his useless bishop on b2.} 34. Bxd4 Nxd4 35. Qh7 {White's queen flanks Black's defences along the h-file, and seems to create several aggressive threats. Now the best move for Black in this position is Ne6, which would have held the position to a possible draw. However, Black gets greedy, and goes on the offensive trying to get as much material as possible. } Nc2 36. Nf7 {White's key move. It turns out that the g6 pawn falls, and he emerges with two connected, passed pawns, creating a crushing threat to Black's position. Notice that moves such as Qe6 do not work because of Nd6, and Black cannot avoid mate without giving up the queen. } Nxa3 {Trying to get as much material as possible, but it is too late. } 37. Qxg6 d4 {Black desperately tries to complicate the game by creating counter-threats of his own passed pawn. However, it turns out impossible to promote. } 38. Qd6+ Ka8 39. e6 {Moving the pawns forward, and supporting the knight on f7. } Nb5 {The knight returns from his travels and settles on a nice outpost, where it attacks the queen and protects the d4 pawn. } 40. Qd5 Qc6 {Another error. Black tries to free the game of queens and to promote his own pawns, but his defence would work much better if there were queens on the board. This is a debatable decision, so please comment if it is right or wrong. White is forced to trade. } 41. Qxc6 bxc6 42. e7 {The pawn charges forward, and Black's knight takes a last stand to stop it from queening. } Nc7 43. Ne5 {The same goes for the White knight. Let's examine the endgame a second time. Material is even, but White has one almost-passed pawn, which will be sooner supported by the second. Black's knight cannot stop both pawns, and his king is too far away. Black tries to create some desperate counterplay to save the game. } a5 {Sacrificing a pawn to get some counterplay, but it turns out to be futile. } 44. f5 {The pawn advances, and the king is powerless to stop it. Black's knight is forced to move to the back rank. } Ne8 45. bxa5 c5 {Trying to get his own pawns to move, but they are easily blocked by White's knight. } 46. Nc4 Ka7 {Advancing the king to disturb the knight, a final attempt of counterplay. } 47. Kg2 Ka6 48. Kf3 Kb5 49. a6 {The pawn sacrifices itself to drive the Black king away. Black is forced to take. } Kxa6 50. Nd6 {The final combination. With Black's knight driven away, White's pawns advanced mercilessly. } Nxd6 51. f6 {The pawns cannot be stopped. } d3 52. f7 d2 53. Ke2 {White's pawns queen, and Black has nothing. Black resigns. 1-0  An excellent game, showing deep strategy and precise calculation from both sides. }
