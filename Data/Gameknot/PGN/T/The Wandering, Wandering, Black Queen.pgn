1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 {4. Bc4 - This is the King Bishop's Gambit arising out of the KGA.  Develops a piece and hits at f7.  Black can check on h4 here but this is not advisable.  Check out a game between Anderssen and Kiezeritzky where Kiezeritzky lost spectacularly.  I have seen that particular game in several regicide manuals but it could be found on the net.} g5 {3. ......... g5 - supports the f pawn, black usually follows this up with Bg7 but chooses to play Nh6 on the next move.} 4. h4 Nh6 5. Qh5 {5. Qh5!  - where there is a queen on h5 or h4 in the opening, there's Old Matey!} Qe7 {5. .......... Qe7 - this queen move adds to the defense of f7 should the knight on h6 have to move or get swapped off.  Black now makes a lot of queen moves from move 7 onwards.  Had it been me, I would have done everything I could to shift that wood from the back row!  Mind you, after my KGA game against Master Chrisobee I have plenty of room to talk!} 6. Nc3 {6. Nc3 - good sensible development here - defends the e pawn.  White plays d3 next move to open a line for the dsb.  This dsb will spell doom for black very shortly.} g4 7. d3 Qf6 {7. ........ Qf6 - trying to hang on to the f pawn and hold things together but would Nc6 or d5 be a better try here?} 8. Nd5 {8. Nd5 - black queen must move again.} Qd6 9. Bxf4 {9. Bxf4 - the f pawn drops anyway.} Qc5 10. b4 Qd4 11. Be5 {11. Be5 - nice, neat bishop fork!} Bxb4+ {11............. Bb4  - a spite check only, after 12 Ke2 black has no follow up checks so waves the white flag.  Excellent development here brings you great rewards.  Well played dmaestro!  Joanne} 12. Ke2 {}
