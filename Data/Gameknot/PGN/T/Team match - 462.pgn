1. e4 {Again I have a hard opponent, but he plays predictable - Slav and Sicilian. I decided to swim into his waters preparing surprises.} c5 {Sicilian } 2. c3 {exactly what I've expected} Nf6 3. e5 {and here again predictable move} Nd5 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nf3 {we follow my (black's) plan} Qc7 {5. ... Qc7! here I secured c4 against white's bishop - often played by my opponent in his games. Let say - my first surprise.} 6. cxd4 e6 7. Bd2 {7. Bd2 ?! It was interesting here what will play my opponent. He follows the theory. But was it his best move ? Black's position looks strong.} d6 8. Nc3 {I decided to exchange the knights here restricting black's bishop by his own pawns.} Nxc3 9. bxc3 {and we have interesting position with no any advantage to the whites.} Nd7 10. Bb5 {10. Bb5 ?! I expected here 10. Qa4 - a better move in my opinion.} Be7 {10. ... Be7! I follow the black's plan. I would have play the same even if white have played 10. Qa4.} 11. O-O O-O {and we almost completed our developments } 12. Re1 h6 {safety first} 13. h3 {13. h3 ?!  I didn't find the idea of that move.} b6 {it's time to complete black's development - make ready Bb7 !} 14. Qe2 Bb7 {ready to attack or counter-attack} 15. exd6 {awaited exchange} Qxd6 {15. ... Qxd6 !} 16. Bd3 {white regroups against black's king side} Nf6 {16. ... Nf6 !! Some reinforcement. But that one move rescued the game and secured the victory !} 17. c4 {17. c4 ? I've expected this center attack but white played 17. c4 ? emotionally and made his first mistake into the game} Bxf3 {17. ... Bxf3 ! of course- wining a pawn, one center pawn !} 18. Qxf3 Qxd4 {and black crowned a victory in the center} 19. Rad1 {19. Rad1 ! and now black queen is into danger - 20.Bxh6 ... 21.Bh7+ and the queen is dead. So it's time to  retreat} Qc5 {19. ... Qc5 !} 20. Re2 Rac8 21. Be3 Qc6 {I offered queens exchange here having a pawn plus and solid position} 22. Qg3 {but white are insidious. They know very well the game flows in muddy stream} Kh8 23. Red2 Bc5 {black would appretiate bishops exchange} 24. Bxh6 {24. Bxh6 ?! gradually losing the battle white decided to rush attack} gxh6 {24. ... gxh6 !  for sure. white missed one flying jump of the vindicator knight} 25. Qh4 {25. Qh4! not bad, but ...} Ng8 {25. ... Ng8 !!  this move exactly smashed the last hope of the white} 26. Qh5 f5 {26. ... f5 !!  again surprise and the blak are safeguarded} 27. Re2 Rc7 {27. ...

Rd4 ! both rooks into the center !} 32. Bc2 Rxd1+ {for sure. now the way of the black bishop is not obstructed and a nice combination is to follow} 33. Bxd1 Qf3+ {33. ... Qf3 + !! if 34. gxf3 Rg1 #, if 34. Rf2 Qxd1# the only defence is 34. Ke1 Rxg2 !  white resign}
