1. e3 {This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes, between my new friend Zach (heavyfire13) and myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav).  So Zach, this 1st move of yours is not particularly bad, the only drawback is that it's pretty passive. The best moves in my opinion, are those that force your opponents hand. On the other hand, if you choose to be a passive player, it's not necessarily a bad thing. I will quote move one from my tutoring game with Ajay, "... I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back, making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up, then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive!". I might add that I was a stronger player then than I am now. Pablo and I had some fierce games, but I never beat him even once! Keep in mind though that in taking advice from me, you are hearing from an aggressive player.  In the opening, it is always important to control the center squares, e4, e5, d4 & d5. One way to do that is to occupy those squares, with your pawns & pieces (playing e4 and / or d4, for example). The other way is what you have chosen, to control them without occupying them (e3 controls d4). This plan you have chosen is not bad, but is usually played by black.} c5 {This move also, does not actually occupy one of those 4 squares, but it controls d4.} 2. Nc3 {So, the knight move controls d5 & e4. Though not a bad move, you are not playing an established opening that I know of. Openings and defenses are established lines of play that came about after centuries of master play. There are plenty of chess books on opening play in any good library or book store. Book stores are better though since chess openings are frequently revised as people play. So you want the most modern you can get. Library books can be pretty old. I suggest Batsford Chess Openings by Kasparov.} g6 {I am preparing to "fianchetto" my bishop.} 3. b3 {So, if you can trade off my bishop I will put on g7, then there will holes on the dark squares on my king side. If I am castled there, (which I planned to be), it could cause problems in my defense. I don't know if this was your mindset in this move, but if it was, you were on the right track.} Bg7 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. d4 O-O 6. Bc4 d5 {Zach, let me make up an imaginary scene, then relate it to chess.  Imagine twins, Jack and Jake setting aside funds for retirement. Jack sets aside $10,000 in the year 2010 and invests it at a certain interest rate, say for example 9%. In the year 2050, his total interest earned would be $304,094.20. After inflation, (supposing a 2% inflation rate), it would be $137,721.30, giving him a total value for his investment of $142,250.20.  Jake on the other hand waits until the year 2040, and sets aside $10,000 and invests it at the same interest rate, 9%. In the year 2050, his total interest earned would be only $13,673.60. After inflation, (supposing the same 2% inflation rate), it would be $11,217.10, giving him a total value for his investment of $19,420.60. What is interesting about this scenario, is that if all things are equal with the exception of the investment dates, Jake can never ever catch up to his twin brother Jack!  You may ask, "Why the lesson on investing? I'm here to play chess!"  One of the most important principles in the opening is to try to get your pieces and pawns developed (moved out of the original square, to a more active location). One way to do this is to force your opponent to move the same pieces over and over again. If you develop a piece, then I develop a pawn to attack your piece, forcing you to move it a 2nd time, I gain a "tempo", and you lose a tempo.  One result of gaining tempo is that it gives you the initiative over your opponent. This means that you have a measure of control over how your opponent moves his pieces. You can't safely castle right now, for example. You'd lose your bishop! Both you and your opponent have things you'd each like to accomplish. Every time your opponent forces you to make a move, he hinders you from doing what you may have planned, (unless of course if the move he forces you to make was actually part of your plan). It is also intriguing to know that if you play an opponent who knows how to take advantage of an initiative, similar to Jake and Jack, you're far less likely to be able to catch up! If he forces you to make a move you did not want to make, it can put you in a position you don't want to be in! Be careful not to allow your opponent to gain tempo faster than you do.  } 7. Bb5 a6 {See my previous note, as it's the same principle. I'm making you move the bishop again. He should be best on e2 where he can't be chased around.} 8. Ba4 {(???) This move allows me to trap the bishop with b5! Whenever you move a piece to a square, ask yourself, can it be chased away? If so, where can it go? When it goes to that new square, can it be chased away? If so, where can it go? and so on...} b5 9. Nxb5 {(???) This again is a question mark move, because after PxN, BxP, the queen can come out and check attacking the b4 square. On every move consider what check threats there are. If there is a check, is it a double attack, forking the king and another piece? These type of thoughts need to be on every move.} axb5 10. Bxb5 Qa5+ 11. Bd2 Qxb5 {So now I have a knight and bishop in exchange for 2 pawns!} 12. c4 {I did not want to play 12. ... PxP 13. PxP QxP (temporarily winning a pawn for me) because I did not want to open up lines for your rook coming to c1 to attack my queen. When I move my queen, you play 14. RxP, winning the pawn back and having a strong Rook or you play 14. PxP gaining a passed pawn, (though the pawn would be easier to stop due to my 2 piece lead).} Qa6 13. dxc5 Nfd7 14. O-O {You always have to look at what is attacked and defended, especially with fianchettoed bishops! Being 2 pieces down already, you can't afford to give up the exchange.} Bxa1 15. Qxa1 Nxc5 16. Qd4 {Good move. Your attacking my knight and pawn while preparing for Bc3, to threaten mate. } Qd6 {Defending the knight. The pawn is not adequately defended, but you can have it if you like. I was more concerned about defending the knight and stopping the impending mate threat, with the bishop and queen on the diagonal. } 17. Bc3 {Uh Ohh! There it is!} f6 {With this move, I threaten to play e5, permanently removing your threat on that diagonal. You should play PxP, so if I play e5, you can capture "en passant".} 18. Ng5 {So I can't take the knight, but the knight does not threaten anything. If you move the queen to h4, to threaten mate on h8, then I can take the knight.} e5 {(!!!) NO more mate threats for you, Pal!} 19. Qh4 {(???) You can't afford to give up any more material!!!} fxg5 20. Qxg5 Rf5 {Making you move your queen again, gaining initiative. See my note on blacks move 6.} 21. Qh6 {(???) You let me trap your queen. Remember, whenever you move a piece to a square, ask yourself, can it be chased away? If so, where can it go? In this case it can't go anywhere. But asking yourself that question would have saved the queen.} Rh5 22. Qxh5 gxh5 23. f4 {As I messaged you, it is common practice to resign a game when in your situation. I suggested you don't resign our game. The reason is there may be techniques I will use in the mate that will be instructional to you. } Nbd7 {I need to develop my pieces on the back rank while defending my Pawn.} 24. b4 Ne4 {Trading is bad for you as you are too far behind in material. So I attack the bishop to see if you will defend it. To keep it you need to move it instead.} 25. Bb2 {Good for you, for moving the bishop, but you moved it to a square where I can attack it further.} Rxa2 26. fxe5 {If my knight were not there, it would be a good counter attack. The queen can't take the pawn, and the rook can't take the bishop due to the attack on the queen.} Nxe5 {But the knight is there.} 27. c5 {You are countering well, until your next move.} Qg6 {Now you are stuck. You can't play 28. BxN as I mate, QxP. You can't play 28. g3, as I play Nxg3. 29. PxN, QxP+ 30. Kh1 Bh3 threatens mate 31. Rg1 Qf3+ 32. Rg2 Qxg2#. If you play 28. Rb1 to defend the Bishop, Nc3!} 28. Bxe5 {You always must look at what is attacked and defended. Having 5 days per move, there is no need to rush. Take your time, look at everything. I mean Every Thing! The rook on a2 was blocked by your bishop which may be why you did not see the indirect attack on your king. But whenever a rook is on the 2nd rank, and your king is on the back rank, there is this threat. The 2nd rank is the strongest place for a rook, when the king is on the 1st rank.} Qxg2# {So Zach, thanks for the game! Hope this helps.   God Bless, Scott}
