1. e4 {This is my first annotation, any comments are appreciated. I won the game, but I could have won it with a beautiful forced mate if I had stopped to look at the position instead of blindly following my plan.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d4 {I thought about 4. Ng5 but went with 4. d4 instead.} Nxe4 5. dxe5 Bc5 {5...Bc5? was the mistake that allowed me to go for a quick win.} 6. Qd5 {This threatens both the Knight on e4 and mate on f7.} Bxf2+ {Black is going to lose one of his minor pieces, regardless of what he does. Taking one of my pawns and forcing my King on an awkward square is probably the best tradeoff.} 7. Ke2 O-O 8. Qxe4 Bb6 {Black's bishop is now on a strong diagonal. With the f2 pawn gone, my King cannot move to g1.} 9. Rd1 {Activating the rook before the King moves back to the first rank. My rook is now lined up with Black's queen which might come in handy.} d6 {This opens the diagonal for the White bishop. dxe5 is out of the question because the pawn on d6 is pinned.} 10. Kf1 Be6 {Black offers a trade of bishops. If 11. Bxe6 fxe6 and Black's rook is free, lined up with my king and pinning my knight.} 11. Bd3 {I don't like the idea of freeing the Black rook. I want to keep the f-file half-closed to give my king some protection. 11. Bd3 temporarily removes the pin on Black's d6 pawn but threatens mate on h7.} g6 12. Bg5 {My idea is to activate a piece with tempo. I may end up putting the bishop on f6 and maneuver my queen to h6. These are some strong threats that Black needs to watch out for.} Qd7 13. Bb5 {This move engages two pins at once. Both the pawn on d6 and the knight on c6 are now pinned to the black queen. Also, I may capture the black knight and trade down whenever I see fit.} Bg4 {Black creates a pin of his own.} 14. Bxc6 {Here I decided to trade down. Maybe maintaining the pins would have been better. 14...Qxc6? is insufficient because of 15. Qxg4 Qxc2 16. Rd2 and Black lost another piece for a single pawn.} bxc6 15. Nc3 {Activating the Knight and planning on Na4 to get the Black bishop off of its strong diagonal.} Bf5 16. Qe2 {Protecting the queen and guarding c2.} d5 {I didn't see this move coming. It's a good way for Black to relieve some of the central tension.} 17. Bf6 {With the Black pawn no longer attacking e5, putting the Bishop on f6 makes for a strong combo that can't be attacked by any pawns.} h6 18. Na4 Rfe8 {I'm not really sure what this move does. The e-file is being blocked very efficiently by my pawn and bishop, so the rook is almost worthless on e8.  18...Rab8 would be stronger in my opinion.} 19. Nxb6 {I get to take black's strongest piece. My rook can now come to d4, and I can start attacking.  19. c4 is a move I didn't even consider in the game, mainly because I had already decided to remove the bishop with my knight. While this unwillingness to evaluate the position wasn't a big deal at that point, a much more weighty situation is about to come up.} cxb6 20. Qe3 {This move attacks the pawn on h6 and is the first step towards a potential mate.  While playing the game I thought that defending with 20...g5 doesn't work because I can simply take with the knight: 21. Nxg5. And if 21...hxg5 22. Qxg5+ leading to mate the next move.  But Black has 21...Bxc2, slowing me down.} Kh7 21. Rd4 c5 {Here it is, the move that threw me off. My plan was to put the rook on h4 and put a heap of pressure on White's kingside defenses. Black attacks my rook and plays right into my hands. I was going to put the rook on h4, so now I'll do just that.  But if I had stopped and taken the time to look at this position I might have instead seen a beautiful forced mate: 22. Qxh6+!  If 22...Kxh6 23. Rh4# If 22...Kg8 23. Qh8#} 22. Rh4 {Oh well, it's not a mate in 2, but the rook on h4 is still very hard to deal with for Black.} h5 23. Qg5 {It's almost over now. I'm threatening Rxh5+ and mate the next move.} Bg4 {The bishop defends h5, but it won't be able to keep things together.} 24. h3 Qb5+ {This is really meaningless. My king can get out of checks easily, and mate will follow soon.} 25. Kf2 Bxf3 {It's over at this point, there's no way to stop mate.} 26. gxf3 Qxb2 27. Rxh5+ {Black resigned because both legal moves lead to an immediate mate. 27...gxh5 28. Qg7# 27...Kg8 28. Rh8#}
