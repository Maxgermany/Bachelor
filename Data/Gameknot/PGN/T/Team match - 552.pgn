1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bc4 O-O {This is a fairly standard way I play the Sicilian - A slight sacrifice in development for flexibility. At the moment, this seems even.} 8. O-O Nxe4 9. Nxe4 d5 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Bd3 dxe4 12. Bxe4 Ba6 13. Qxd8 Rfxd8 14. Rfb1 Rd6 {After a forced set of exchanges, material is even. I've got some control of the open file, but White's bishops seem better placed.} 15. c3 Bd3 16. Bxd3 Rxd3 17. Rbd1 Rd5 {Not so happy now. I forgot I couldn't play Ra-d1 because White captures the pawn.} 18. Rab1 a5 19. a4 Rb8 20. Kf1 Rbd8 21. Rxd5 Rxd5 22. Ke2 Kf8 {A blunder! Now White can force a material lead.} 23. Rd1 Be5 24. h3 {A mistake by White - now Black can level the game. 24.Rxd5 cxd5 25. Bb6 and White captures the a pawn - I think this should give white a convincing advantage due to the nature of the passed pawn on the Queenside. Black can't even capture at Bxh2 because White plays g3 and traps the bishop.} Bc7 25. c4 Rxd1 26. Kxd1 Ke8 27. Kc2 Kd7 28. Kc3 Be5+ 29. Bd4 Bxd4+ 30. Kxd4 Kd6 31. c5+ Kd7 32. Kc4 Kc7 33. f4 f6 34. g4 h5 35. Kd4 Kd7 36. Kc4 Kc7 37. Kd4 {Draw agreed.}
