1. e4 {Usual start for me...I know tag ... he is going to play d5 as usual , } d5 {Yep..there it is !} 2. e5 {Echange the pawns and the queen comes out , possiblt wreaking havoc..lets keep it tied up for the time being.} c5 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 {Not to keen on this queen move only way to re-capture , but it will beocme a target now} a6 {Tryin to prevent Bb5 } 5. Nc3 {Threatening the central pawn} e6 {As expected..defending pawn and opening up diagonal to develop bish} 6. a3 {Cuts down his bishops options} Nc6 {here we go...knew this queen had come out too early !} 7. Qf4 {Has to saty somewhere where it can protect e5} Qc7 {Puts more pressure on e5} 8. Nf3 {Which I fortify} h6 {Maybe worried I would move queen to g5 , but I hadnt thought of that !} 9. Bd3 Be7 10. O-O b5 11. Ne2 {Worried about P-b4 , so moving to safety} g5 {hmmm...not sure about this one tag mate ! chases my queen , but weak kingside defences and a nice open diagonal...will I manage to take advantage? lets see} 12. Qe3 Bb7 13. Nfd4 {This was a mistake..have removed a defender of pawn on e5 , now I am going to lose it} Bc5 {But maybe not yet..cos he wants to tie me up with this pin 1st} 14. c3 {Needs extra protection or I lose it} O-O-O {Intersting choice of move. Cant go Kingside cos of opne diagonal , but Im now looking at this nice file with K and Q together with no black pawns in front} 15. b4 {Hoping for bishop for knight exchange to open up that file for me} Bb6 {Damn , he knows what I am after and wont do it !} 16. Bb2 {This diagonal looks tasty..Im sure something good will come of this later...} Nxe5 {There goes my pawn..couldnt hold it..pawn down against tag usually means a loss..my record against him isnt so good} 17. a4 {tryin to break open his defences} Nxd3 18. Qxd3 e5 19. axb5 {what am I doing ..this loses me a knight !} exd4 {which he grabs of course} 20. bxa6 {but I now have a nasty thorn in his side with this pawn!! hee hee} Bc6 21. Rfc1 {put a bit of pressure on this file that I have had my eye on for a while} Ne7 22. b5 {pressure is on now..move that bishop off this rank.. take pawn on d4 and its looking good for me...lets see} dxc3 {helping me out here thanks} 23. Bxc3 {now I at least win my piece back if not more} Kd7 {good idea to get king off that rank , but I am now attacking rook, and bishop and got a passed pawn..the end is nigh !} 24. bxc6+ {regains my lost piece and I am also about to win the rook too} Nxc6 25. Bxh8 Rxh8 26. Qxd5+ {flurry of exchanges leaving me a nice advantage and still a nice thorn in side of a pwan..} Ke7 {No way of saving the Knight either} 27. Qxc6 Bxf2+ {I take it this means u give up then?} 28. Kxf2 Qa7+ 29. Qc5+ {forces the exchange of queens...which would leave me a simple end game , but  enough is enough and I score a rare win against my nemesis}
