1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 Bg4 {Anti-Colle, so switch to QGD with moves like c4 Qb3 and Nc3 are called for} 4. c4 Bxf3 {? Voluntarily giving up the bishop pair} 5. Qxf3 {No sense of a trap here} c6 6. Nc3 e6 7. Bd3 Bb4 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 {Happy to have a majority in the centre} O-O 10. O-O Nbd7 11. cxd5 exd5 {Pawns pointing at my king but no bishops left for him} 12. c4 b6 13. cxd5 cxd5 {Voluntarily going for the isolani} 14. Bd2 {Connecting Rooks} Re8 15. Rfc1 {MOving onto open file} Ne4 16. Bb4 {Retaining bishop pair} a5 17. Be1 {Still retaining bishop pair} Ndf6 18. h3 Qd6 19. Rc2 Rac8 20. Qe2 {Can't remember why I played this} Rxc2 21. Qxc2 h6 22. Bd2 {Offering my "bad" bishop} Ng5 23. Bb5 Rd8 24. f3 {Stopping the knights coming back in to e4} Qg3 25. Kf1 Qh2 {Threatening 26... Qh1+ and 27. Qxa1} 26. Qd1 Nh5 27. Be1 Ng3+ 28. Bxg3 Qxg3 29.

Bc6 Nd6 41. Qa1 Rb3 42. Ke2 Qe7 {He gets a lot of pressure on e3} 43. Rc3 Nb5 {Aimed at exploiting the pin but when analysing the move I sensed a blunder and spotted that after some moves my queen on a1 could see d4 and deal with the check that way. I felt strongly he had made a "retained" image error and still saw my rook on c3 ... but I had to calculate this to confirm} 44. Rxb3 {A bit surprised with the resignation but when I played the move I felt I could deal with some perpetual threats though I had seen the line 44.... Qe6  45. Rxb5 Qxc6  46. Rb2 Qxg2+ 47. Kd3 Qe4+ etc.  I had not seen 44... Qe6 and 45. d5! working to defend bishop and simultaneously screen the rook and simultaneously attack queen and that it was fine .... since Q still covered d4}
