1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Bg4 3. Bg2 Nd7 4. O-O e6 5. d3 Bd6 6. Nbd2 Ne7 7. h3 Bh5 {This is a very unusual move. Typically, Black will trade here.  I've faced this before and ended up playing Kh2, but I see a recommendation to play g4. We'll see.} 8. e4 c6 {At first look, that doesn't seem good. It covers up a good square for his knight, and I'd think that c5 would be stronger. It's not as if I'm really interested at all in trading on d5 (maybe he doesn't know that). But maybe he's using that to slow down my bishop on g2, should the center pawns disappear.} 9. Re1 O-O {Okay, time to push the pawn. But first, we've got to move that bishop further back. You always have to really consider what you're doing to your kingside when you push another pawn to drive back the bishop. Will it hurt you if he sacrifices the bishop for the pawn (or two)? Have you opened yourself up too much?} 10. g4 Bg6 11. e5 {Having a pawn on e5 is a goal in this opening. Next, I need to reposition my N on d2 to a better square and develop my other bishop.} Bc7 12. Nf1 c5 13. Bg5 Qe8 14. Bh4 {He's heading for g3 to help guard the pawn in case Black plays Nc6.} Nc6 15. Bg3 h6 16. h4 h5 17. g5 Qe7 {That surprises me. I thought he would play Bf5 and then Bg4 and keep my bishop from reaching h3. Maybe he was worried about Ne3 trading the bishop, but I think I would lose my e5 pawn if I did that.} 18. Bh3 c4 19. Qe2 cxd3 20. cxd3 Qb4 {That's a strong move. I feel like I've got lots of pawn problems: b2, d3, e5, and even h4.} 21. Rad1 Ba5 22. Ne3 Qb5 23. d4 {It's a forced move; otherwise, I have to play Rf1. But I'm really unhappy with my pawn structure. I've never had a structure that looks like this in this opening.} a6 24. Qxb5 axb5 25. Re2 Be4 26. Bg2 Bb6 {Now I can't guard all of my pawns. After a3, he'll trade off my knight on f3 and then win the pawn on d4. And after that pawn dies, can I hold on to the pawn on e5? I may have to punt this game. I'm not sure I remember ever getting into a worse position with this opening.} 27. a3 Bxf3 28. Bxf3 Nxd4 29. Bxh5 {Should I move the rook and let him have the bishop, or should I trade the rook for a pawn and a knight? That choice is easy. What I suppose, though, is after those trades, he'll force trades on b4 and e3, and my pawns will become unsupportable.} Nxe2+ 30. Bxe2 b4 31. axb4 Ra2 32. Rd2 Rc8 33. Nd1 {I'm surprised that he never played Bxe3. It causes another set of weak pawns, and it trades pieces. He must not want to give me two bishops against his knight and rook. I'm expecting Rc1 to come next.} Ra4 34. Bb5 Rxb4 35. Bxd7 Rc7 36. Be8 Kf8 37. Bxf7 Kxf7 38. Kg2 Rd4 {No need to drag this out. I don't feel like I'm playing well, and I'm about to lose at least another pawn. Might as well go concentrate on a different game.}
