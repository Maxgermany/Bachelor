[Opening "Sicilian (B51), Canal-Sokolsky (Nimzovich-Rossolimo, Moscow) attack"]

1. e4 c5 {I am playing with Black against a stronger player. As usual, I play the Sicilian Defence.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {White avoids the main lines. This is a move that is still quite common.} Nc6 {Other possible moves are 3...Bd7 and 3...Nd7.} 4. Bxc6+ {White gives up the bishop pair and Black is left with doubled pawns.} bxc6 {I am happy to play this position. The doubled pawns are not that bad.} 5. O-O Nf6 {A simple developing move. This is not played as often as 5...e5 or 5...Bg4. I think the next move shows why.} 6. e5 {White hits the knight and tries to induce dxe5, which leaves Black with isolated doubled pawns.} Nd5 {I rather move the knight than break my pawn structure.} 7. Re1 {Moving the rook to a better square and renewing the threat of forcing isolated doubled pawns (exd6 and Black cannot recapture with the e-pawn). My position is quite awkward.} g6 {I decide to fianchetto the dark-squared bishop.} 8. h3 {I do not understand this move. 8. exd6 seems better for White. } Be6 {Now I can recapture with the e-pawn again.} 9. d3 {Opening the diagonal for the bishop.} Bg7 {Developing the other bishop.} 10. Nbd2 {Developing the knight first.} O-O {The king gets away from the e-file.} 11. Nc4 {The knight is well-placed here. However, 11. Ne4 was also possible, because I cannot capture the e5-pawn without losing the c-pawn and then probably another pawn.} Rb8 {My rook moves to the half-open file. The b-pawn is protected now, but the situation may change later.} 12. Bd2 {Develops the bishop.} Nb4 {I want to play d5, so the knight must move away. 12. Nb6 is also possible.} 13. a3 {White hits the knight.} Na6 {And it retreats. Moving it back to d5 was possible, but I wanted to follow my plan to play d5.} 14. Bc3 {Now White has a bishop on the long diagonal where it opposes my fianchettoed bishop.} d5 {Just in time. White threatened exd6 and then exchange the dark-squared bishops. } 15. Ba5 {An intermediate move. I am not convinced this improves White's position.} Qd7 {The queen moves out of the way and the rooks are connected.} 16. Ncd2 {White moves the knight to a safe square. This move also sets up a little trap.} Rxb2 {I take the pawn, although I see that the rook can be trapped.} 17. Nb3 {Now the rook cannot move and Bc3 is the threat.} Rxb3 {So I take the knight with the rook. I think I have compensation for the exchange. After the game I noticed that I could have got a pawn more with 17...Rb8 18. Bc3 R2xb3 19. cxb3 d4! 20. Bb2 Rxb3.} 18. cxb3 d4 {Gaining space and opening a diagonal for the light-squared bishop.} 19. Nd2 {The knight aims at e4- and c4-squares.} f5 {I cover the e4-square. } 20. Nc4 {I think 20. exf6 e.p. was probably better. The knight is not too useful here.} f4 {Since White's pieces are on the queenside and the center is kind of closed, I create some action on the kingside.} 21. f3 {This is preventing me from playing f3 breaking the pawn shelter in front of the king.} Rf5 {Lifting the rook, so that it can participate the attack.} 22. Bd2 {This locks the rook to defend the f4 pawn, but only temporarily.} Nc7 {I have the knight and good squares waiting for it.} 23. Rc1 {The rook moves here to add pressure to the doubled pawns. However, I have a stronger plan.} Nd5 {A very good square for the knight.} 24. Na5 {Threatening the c5-pawn.} Ne3 {And the knight goes to an even better square. The Na6-c7-d5-e3 manouver has improved my position dramatically.} 25. Qe2 {White should consider 25. Bxe3, although 25...fxe3 26. Rxc5 Rxe5 does not look promising to White.} Rg5 {The g2-pawn is the next target. However, the simple 25...Rxe5 would have been even stronger. The line that I played is based on a miscalculation deeper in this variation.} 26. Bxe3 {The exchange happens now.} dxe3 {I capture with this pawn, so White cannot play f4.} 27. Rxc5 {Taking the weak pawn. I was expecting something like 27. h4 Rg3 28. Qf1 Bh3 29. Re2.} Bxh3 {Threatening Rxg2+. Only after the game I noticed that White can play 28. e6! Rxg2+ 29. Qxg2 Qd4 30. Qxh3 Qxc5 winning for White.} 28. Nxc6 {A blunder.} Rxg2+ 29. Qxg2 Bxg2 30. Kxg2 Qxd3 {Now White's position is hopeless. The threat is Qd2+ winning the rook.} 31. Kh3 Qd2 {Again threatening the rook.} 32. Rec1 {Trying to defend, but 32. Rg1 was better, although still losing.} Qf2 {Threatens mate in one.} 33. Nxe7+ {There are not that many options.} Kf7 34. e6+ Kxe7 {I calculated that White cannot cause any real trouble with the rooks.} 35. Rc5c7+ Kf6 36. Rf7+ Kg5 37. Rc5+ Kh6 38. Rxf4 {Threatens Rh4+.} e2 {And I ignore it. If 39. Rh4+ Qxh4 40. Kxh4 e1Q+.} 39. Rc1 {Desperate.} e1=Q 40. Rxe1 Qxe1 41. Re4 Qf1+ 42. Kg4 {There is not reason to make White suffer any longer.} Qg2+ 43. Kf4 Qg5# {I thought I played quite well, but there was I crucial mistake at move 27, which White did not punish. So I won.}
