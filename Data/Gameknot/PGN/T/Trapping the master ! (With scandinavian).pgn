1. e4 {great 1882 elo's accept to play with poor 1346 ... it's an honor for me, i will do my best to not be boring} d5 {let's some agressive game, this is the most good chance we have in blitz playing aginst good players, there not too much time to analyze...} 2. exd5 {scnadinavian gambit accepted, follow Kf6 ...e6  variation} Nf6 3. Nc3 {normaly peaople play c4 so this will be something new and interesting} e6 {main line} 4. Bc4 {so i canot recover my pawn for the moment, i will anoid the knight c3 protection and develop my DSB} Bb4 5. Qf3 {ho, i dont like this dangeours queen, after a few exchanges, it can make an irreversible threat. I have to be carefull and correctly calculate. First i exchange bishop with knight to anoid pressure on center} Bxc3 6. dxc3 {ouf, feeling better...} O-O {then secure the king and preparing treath with rook on e colon, white is missing castle} 7. Bg5 {dangerous but i have a plan : for the moment i cant use the f knight to take back d5, but after exd5, i can move the queen in e8 + and then after i take back the white bishop...but i will have a better opportunity ...} exd5 {i suppose that Bc4 x d5 ....} 8. O-O-O {but no ! surprise ! this treath on d colon is god, but it's a blunder however because of Bc8 g4!} Bg4 {then my great challenger resign and disconnect ... the game was not lost anyway }
