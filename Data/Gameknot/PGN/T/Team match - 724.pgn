1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {This is not a good developing square for the bishop. Better is d3 or Bb5} e6 3. Nc3 a6 {white can take advantage of black's excessive pawn moves with a4 or the super agressive e5. The aim of e5 is to create a bind in black's position, thus making him feel cramped.} 4. a3 {This is too weak, a4 should have been played in order to prevent ...b5.} b5 5. Ba2 {because of white timid a3 black enjoys a massive queenside advantage.} Bb7 6. Nf3 Qc7 7. O-O Nf6 8. d3 Be7 9. e5 {Because of blacks strength on the light diagonal playing this move is not recommended. White should have played Re1.} Nd5 10. Re1 {White can avoid the exchange with Ne4.} Nxc3 11. bxc3 {Usaully when this happens it is a sign that the wrong move has been played. Black has acheived an important positional advantage by creating a lasting weakness in whites pawn structure. } d5 12. d4 c4 {hum this is not good for black. With his massive advantage on the queenside he should open some lines of attack.} 13. Bf4 Nd7 14. Qd2 Nf8 {White can start an attack of his own with H4. } 15. Qc1 Ng6 16. Bg5 {White needs this bishop! better is Bg3. } Bxg5 17. Nxg5 O-O 18. Nf3 {as a result of the bishop exchange white is totally passive.} Qe7 19. Rb1 {I can see white is trying to do is to attack b5. But it is better to leave this side close for as long as possible. } Bc6 20. a4 Rab8 {white has just invited a wirlwind. } 21. axb5 axb5 22. h4 Rba8 23. Ra1 Qa3 24. Qg5 Qxc3 25. h5 h6 26. Qg4 {Qd2 is better. Hoping to exchange queens and weather the storm. The problem of Qg4 is that now white's queen is not out of position.} Nh8 27. Nh2 {It is better to leave this knight on f3 to protect the back rank.} Rxa2 {Maybe a stronger defence is } 28. Nf3 {Maybe a stronger defence is 28. RxR Qxe1  29. Nf1} Rxa1 29. Rxa1 Qxa1+ 30. Kh2 Qd1 31. Qg3 Qxc2 32. Ng5 hxg5 33. Qxg5 Qf5 34. Qh4 g5 35. Qg3 Qf4 36. Qxf4 gxf4 37. f3 b4 {In my opinion White should have played a4 to prevent b5. As a rule if black plays a6 then white usually must play a4 in order to prevent black from creating a strong attack on the queenside. Plus, White did a poor job of developing his pieces to squares that maximize their potently. In conclusion this is an instructive game that show you what happens when black is allowed to play b5 unchallenged.}
