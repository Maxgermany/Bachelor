1. e4 {I play as black on this one.  And it's a long game, good old fashioned chess, only one real blunder made by myself....the rest are more or less tactical errors I think.} c5 {I prefer the sicillian as black...} 2. Bc4 e6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Nf3 Nd4 5. Nxd4 cxd4 6. Na4 d5 7. Bb5+ Bd7 8. Qe2 a6 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 10. Nc5 {i guess you could call this his blunder, but me not taking his N with my B is a real blunder by me...I suppose I was caught in the moment, it happens OTB} Qc6 {blunder by me, not taking his N was a crucial mistake.  Not to mention my entire kingside is still taking a nap. } 11. exd5 Qxc5 12. dxe6 fxe6 13. Qxe6+ Qe7 14. Qxe7+ Bxe7 15. O-O Nf6 16. Re1 {great, now I can't castle because he'll take my B} Nd5 17. Re5 Rd8 18. d3 O-O 19. g3 Bf6 20. Re4 Nb4 {at this point I'm happy.  I think I'm going to end up another pawn up } 21. c3 Nxd3 22. Bd2 Nxb2 {working out better than I had planned...} 23. cxd4 Bxd4 24. Be3 Bxe3 25. Rxe3 {Ok, I feel like I'm sitting pretty...now my tactical errors begin.} Rd1+ 26. Rxd1 Nxd1 27. Re2 Nc3 28. Rc2 Ne4 29. f4 Rd8 30. Rc7 b5 31. Ra7 Rd1+ 32. Kg2 Rd2+ 33. Kf3 Nc3 34. a3 Rd3+ 35. Kg4 Ne4 36. Rxa6 Nf2+ 37. Kf5 g6+ 38. Kf6 {this moves looks harmless, but his r-a8 causes a mate in 2!} Ne4+ 39. Ke5 Nc5 40. Ra5 Rb3 41. Kf6 {back to the a8 is mate problem} Nd7+ 42. Ke6 Nf8+ {temporary relief of that issue} 43. Ke7 Re3+ 44. Kf6 h6 {seeing a mate myself} 45. Ra6 {he apparently saw it as well, my R - e6 was mate until he made this nice block.} Re4 46. f5 gxf5 47. Kxf5 Ra4 {looking back, other than my obvious miss on his N earlier in the game, this move was probably not my strongest choice. } 48. Rxa4 bxa4 49. Ke4 Nd7 {Right here I realize that I have a problem.  The rook exchange was not in my best interest.} 50. Kd4 Kg7 51. Kc4 Ne5+ 52. Kb5 Kg6 53. Kxa4 Kg5 54. Kb5 Nf3 55. h3 Ng1 56. h4+ Kg4 57. a4 Kxg3 58. a5 {Now it's his race to win...} Kxh4 59. a6 h5 60. a7 Nf3 61. a8=Q Kg4 62. Qe4+ Kg3 63. Qg6+ Kh4 64. Kc5 Ng5 65. Kd4 Kg4 {I had to get into position, which is a moot point by now.} 66. Ke5 h4 67. Qf5+ Kh5 68. Kf4 Kh6 69. Qxg5+ Kh7 70. Qxh4+ {Now I try for the ever classic stalemate...} Kg7 71. Kf5 Kf7 72. Qf6+ Kg8 {if he went k-g6 stalemate...and he pointed it out before he made his next move...} 73. Qe7 Kh8 74. Kg6 Kg8 75. Qg7# {Other than my lack of attentiveness at the beginning, not taking his N with my bishop and going up 3, this was a good game for OTB.}
