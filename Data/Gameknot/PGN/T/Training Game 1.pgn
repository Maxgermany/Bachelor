1. d4 {This was a training game between the team coach and I where I immediately began messing up by not opening e4. Going in, I had no plan except to use the opening DB, observe the position of the board carefully, and try not to screw up too much. Altogether, I think I played a decent game, I just found I had a tendency to overthink every move when the obvious move was the best. Several times I overlooked an advantageous position by telling myself "But Pete is really, really good so there's got to be a better move." and then making a wrong move. Anyhow, I will annotate using my in-game notes and comments to illustrate my thinking with occasional deviation to explore a mistake.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 { And now I'm facing a pickle. The proscribed move here is e3, but Qc2 is a close second and probably because of the likelihood of Bxc3 followed by bxc3 and stacking pawns on the c file. e3 seems like the better move to me simply because I know bishops tend to be stronger later in the game and the board doesn't seem to be all that closed. It seems unlikely you'd want to trade your B for an N at this stage unless I decide to move to a3, but still the same problem with the stacked pawns. Seems silly to use a move only to force stacking my own pawns. I tend to think you'll opt for further development and so I probably should as well.} 4. e3 b6 5. f3 { I chose f3 here because of both your fianchetto and your N at f6. Ostensibly I can sort bay of your options for a moment with this move and still leave room for my B at d3 and the N at e2. I would expect either O-O or Bb7 next from you.  Coaching note: i see your reasoning but Nf3 was still the better move. with f3 you disrupt the probable K defence when later you 0-0} c5 6. Bd3 {Planning on sticking with my original plan of Bd3 and Ne2, but Bd2 seems like a more necessary move in the immediate setting to prevent Bxc3 and stacking my pawns. I still sort of expect you'd want to trade your DS bishop for the knight, or perhaps just maintain the pin. The pin forces me to deal with your B at every consideration, but you've also closed it in with your pawn at c5. The pawn closing it in makes it a more attractive swap, as it becomes sort of lame at b5 just for maintenance, plus b4 is a crap trade for you. I think you're just waiting for me to a3 before making the trade. Now... having said all of that, I expect Nc6 is your next move.} cxd4 7. exd4 {The last move was not what I was expecting, but it makes sense in that it forces exd4 to save my N and exposes the K file, which is made worse by my pawn at f3. I think I'll be paying for that later.  I still expect Nc6 next, but d6 would make sense, too.  Coaching note: so you didnt consider BxN then? i have destroyed your pawn structure (with a little f3 help from you) so now to complete the demolition} Bxc3+ {I guess you have a little more insight as to why my rating is what it is. I don't see any other move aside from bxc3. My expectation remains the same for your response, but that's not really a stretch. } 8. bxc3 {Continuing my earlier plan. I'd expect you to castle next, or Nc6 as there is no penalty for either.} Ba6 9. Ne2 Nc6 { Ok, so now my pawn structure is in ruins, but I've got a few options left I guess. I considered Bg5 here, but I thought you'd likely just h6 and force me to trade to put your Q at f6, which doesn't seem attractive for me. I would expect you'll castle as well and start moving to exploit the pawn at f3.  Coaching note: a good alternative here would have been Ba3 to prevent my 0-0 for a while   You know, I did look at that but discarded the idea since the block with d6 was so easy and then I lost the right diagonal from its current position. d6 didn't look like it would inconvenience you at all.} 10. O-O { And looking at it further, it looks like a better move now as it seems Re8 would be the best way for you to avoid it, which I want to follow up with d5 to make a trade, unstack my pawns, and hopefully form some kind of attack if I can coordinate my N and Q along those lines.} O-O 11. Ba3 d6 12. d5 {This next move seemed relatively obvious to me, though refer to my rating for the relative value of obvious. I expect you'll exd5 to save the N.} exd5 13. cxd5 {Simply trading to unstack my c rank. I expect you'll move to protect your B.} Bxd3 14. dxc6 {I considered Qxd3. Seems like your next move is either Nxd5 (unlikely due to the Q) or more likely Ne5 to force me to ove my Q again whilst you gain ground. I ended up going with dxc6 as it affords more options I think. Plus I can still Qxe2 if you initiate a trade there and pull guard from there if you Re8.  Coaching note: good and accurate analysis  } Bxe2 15. Qxe2 Qc7 16. Rfd1 {I had considered Qb5, but discarded it because of a6. Rfd1 looks better because I can even things out again once you Qxc6 due to my B at a3. I'm guessing since you're initiating the trade, though, that I've lost tempo somewhere.  Coaching note: If you were going to play a R move then better was Rad1. It was doing not a lot on a1. The R on f1 was protecting the K and should have remained on that side. The reason i initiated exchanges goes right back to your f3. you have ended up with a bad pawn structure relative to mine so if i trade down to a K and pawn ending then i must have an advantage.} Qxc6 17. Rxd6 {I'm making this move with the idea you'll move to protect your Q and depending on which way you jump, I want to line up my rooks and/or team up my Q with one or both of my Rs, with the added benefit of the discovered threat on your R at f8 if I need to vacate d6. If you were closer to my level, I'd expect Qxc3, but from your annotations and forum posts I've read, it seems unlikely you'd bring your Q out with so little cover. However, Qxc3 followed by Rfc8 looks pretty solid as cover. Even still, I feel like this is my best option.} Qxc3 {Obviously I should be looking at the threat of Qxa1+ and moving to remedy it, right?} 18. Rd3 Qxa1+ 19. Rd1 Rae8 20. Bxf8 {There are a series of trades coming through and nothing really spectacular. Since my blunder at Qxa1+ I've just been following what makes the most sense. } Rxe2 21. Rxa1 Kxf8 22. Kf1 Nd5 {And here's where my really trouble started, oddly enough. Pete has made a very rare mistake and this sends me into psychological overdrive for the rest of the game where I overlook several key moves as being too obvious and instead convince myself that mistakes are the right path. I don't know if this is true, or if I'm trying to make myself feel better, but I think against a lesser opponent, I would have won this game.   Hmmm... I feel like I'm missing something, but the only consequence of this move I can see is a fork at Nc3+.  Or another at Nf4+, but I feel like both are relatively well defended.} 23. Kxe2 Ke8 24. g3 Kd7 25. a3 Ne7 26. Kd3 Nf5 27. Kc4 Kc6 28. Rb1 Nd6+ 29. Kb4 {Through here Pete has instructed me to use my R to divide the board into quadrants and keep his K where I want him. I think I do a relatively decent job of it after a few false starts, but I've already lost the game in my head. Here's my comment to him: This seemed like the best move since this side of the board is the obvious focus. I'm expecting a5+ and planning to pull back whilst eventually getting the R to c1.} a5+ 30. Kb3 Nf5 31. Rc1+ Kd5 32. Rc7 Nd6 33. g4 h6 34. h4 Ke5 35. Rc6 {Here, I think this was a mistake and so did Pete. Here's my commentary along with a note: I'm unsure here, but it seems like you'll want to keep your N safe, so I doubt you'll Kf4 due to Rxd6. I would expect perhaps b5 or g5.  Coaching note: playing a4 1st would have made sure of swapping the pawn off  My response, because I honestly wasn't seeing it at the time: Hmmm... Doesn't that lead from f4+to Ke4 Rxd6 Kxf4 and then the rest of my pawns? I looked at that as well and didn't see a good way to stop your K and fgh with just my R. Every way I looked, you got all on mine and kept one of yours.  Coaching note: no if i go for f4 pawn then trade my N for it i am dead. My N is the only piece i can harry you with so i must keep it. to f4+ i would play Kd5 protecting the N and attacking your R.} b5 36. a4 bxa4+ 37. Kxa4 f5 38. Rc5+ {Here the analysis prefers Kxa5 followed by a pawn trade at g4. Eventually the four remaining pawns get locked up at h5/h6 and g4/g5 and the advantage of the R is maximized. Live and learn.} Kf4 {I'm beginning to see the ending here. I've wasted all my previous advantage with hesitation, second guessing, and general inability to recognize good moves.} 39. gxf5 Nxf5 40. Kxa5 {And here the analysis prefers Rc4+ to preserve my last pawn. The idea being, of course, that I divide the board for his K and lock him under the 5th rank. I, however, didn't do that.} Nxh4 41. Rc4+ Kg5 42. f4+ Kg4 43. Kb5 Ng2 44. Kc5 Nxf4 45. Kd6 Kf5 {I've seen now that I can't win and so resigned to get to work on this annotation. If I've missed anything obvious here, please feel free to point it out in any comment section. }
