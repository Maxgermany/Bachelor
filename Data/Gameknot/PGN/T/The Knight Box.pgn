[Opening "French (C13), Albin-Alekhine-Chatard attack"]

1. e4 {Here is my last game, and only loss, in my own mini-tournament - especially painful as I was 5 points up at the time of the clever checkmate!} e6 {I play my characteristic French Defence. I have described it in detail in many of my annotated games: I'm too lazy to do this now.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 {I play the Steinitz Defence - or something like that. Nowadays I much prefer the lively Winawer Variation, 3...Bb4.} 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 {Claiming space, as usual in the French Defence, by advancing the e-pawn, but this time it is with tempo as my knight move.} Nfd7 6. Bb5 {? A blunder. I win White's dark-squared bishop.} Bxg5 7. Nf3 Bh6 8. O-O O-O {Now that I am up by a piece, I am happy to keep the game quiet, hence my castling on the same side as White.} 9. Re1 c6 {Breaking the pin, forcing White's bishop to move. Perhaps 9...c5 would have been stronger.} 10. Ba4 Na6 11. a3 Nb6 12. Bb3 Bd7 {At first glance, my knights are very powerful: look at them, exercising their power across the (closed) queenside! However, it is soon clear that these knights are forever locked out of the game. So I am actually 3 points behind! I think this is the long-term and most important cause of my eventual destruction.} 13. Ne2 c5 {NOW I finally went ahead with ...c5. I was trying to open up the position and hoping to free at least one knight.} 14. c3 c4 {Oh dear. Like a complete plonker, I close the box around my knights again.} 15. Bc2 Rc8 {Not a particularly good place for my rook, but then, it's better than a8 or b8.} 16. Ng3 f6 17. Nh5 {My opponent's knights - which are in the middle of the action, unlike mine - are leaping into the attack. Perhaps, contrary to normal rules, my king would actually have been SAFER on the queenside!} fxe5 18. Nxe5 {Another knight hovering around my kingside.} Qg5 19. Re3 g6 20. Rg3 Qd2 21. Qxd2 Bxd2 {The queens are exchanged off, and I, unbelievavly, already regarded the game as won. Like a beginner, I made the mistake of only counting the material on the whole board, not in certain areas of the board.} 22. Rf1 Kh8 {Freeing my g-pawn to kill the knight.} 23. Rh3 gxh5 24. Rxh5 {It was only then, at an overall 5 POINTS AHEAD, that I realised how much trouble I really was in. I couldn't flee with the king: 25.Bxh7+ stopped me in my tracks. Staying where I was, I had 25.Ng6+ to deal with. Advancing the pawn? Also 25.Ng6+, or maybe 25.Rxh6+. But the move I played was doubtless the worst of my options...} Rfg8 25. Rxh7# {Owch. Thanks for looking at this annotating, everyone.}
