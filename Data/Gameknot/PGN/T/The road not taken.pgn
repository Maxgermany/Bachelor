1. d4 {Neither I nor my opponent played very well in this game. But both of us missed a pretty queen sac which makes it worth publishing.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. e3 Bb7 5. Bd3 d5 6. b3 c5 {Somewhere back in my youth I read that if Black can get this pawn break in with impunity, he can claim equality. So I felt pretty good here.} 7. Bb2 Nbd7 8. Nc3 Be7 9. Bc2 cxd4 10. Nxd4 {The GK analyzer prefers 10. Qxd4. I agree.} dxc4 11. bxc4 O-O 12. Rg1 {The point of this funny looking move is to try and mate Black before he can win the c pawn and the ending. But the center is way too open for this to have worked. Nor did the GK analyzer think much of it. But thanks to a blunder of mine, it almost succeeded!} Ne5 13. Qe2 Qc7 14. Bb3 a6 {Well, it just never occurred to me that white could simply kick my knight away. GK points out that I could win a pawn here with ... Rfc8 15. Ndb5 Qc6 16. Rd1 Nxc4 17. Bxc4 Qxc4 } 15. f4 Ned7 16. g4 Nc5 17. Bc2 Nce4 {Of course, as soon becomes apparent, I moved the wrong knight to e4 based on an oversight!} 18. g5 Nxc3 19. Bxc3 {What both my opponent and I missed is that the queen sac 19. gxf6 is playable! GK then recommends that I resign myself to the loss of a piece by recapturing on f6 rather than incurring the mayhem of taking the bait. After ... Nxe2 comes 20. Rxg7+ Kh8 21. Rxh7+ Kg8 22.Rg7+ Kh8 23. Kxe2 Qxc4+ 24. Kf2 Qxc2+ 25.Nxc2	when not only is White threatening the bishop but mate via Rag1-g3-h3. Now that the crisis is past, Black has a clear edge because of the weak c pawn and White's King who is stuck in the middle.} Ne4 20. Bxe4 Bxe4 21. Rg3 e5 {GK preferred ...Rac8. I'm not sure I agree as this turned out pretty dang well.} 22. fxe5 Qxe5 23. Rc1 Qd6 24. Qg4 Bg6 25. h4 {GK prefers 25. Nf5, and this time I have to agree.} Qa3 26. Ne2 Qc5 27. Bd4 Qa5+ 28. Bc3 Bb4 29. h5 Bd3 30. h6 Rfd8 31. e4 Bxc4 32. g6 fxg6 33. hxg7 Bxc3+ 34. Rgxc3 b5 35. Kf2 Kxg7 36. Nf4 Qb6+ 37. Kg3 Rd2 38. Rf3 Qd6 39. Rh1 Be2 40. Qh4 h5 41. Re3 Qe5 42. Rc1 g5 43. Rc7+ Kg8 {}
