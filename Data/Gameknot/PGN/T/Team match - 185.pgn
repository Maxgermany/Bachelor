Nf3 Nc6 4. d3 Nd4 {Now Pe5 is undefended.} 5. Nxe5 Bd6 6. Qh5 Nxc2+ {Nice.} 7. Kf1 {NxRa1 can wait.  Qf6 counters the queen threat.} Nxa1 8. Bxh6 O-O {That is one way out.} 9. Bxf7+ Kh8 10. Bxg7+ Kxg7 11. Qg4+ Kf6 {Kh8 might have been safer.} 12. Qf5+ Ke7 {No, the king has nowhere to hide after Qg5.  :(} 13. Qg5# {}
