[Opening "QGD (D06), Marshall defence"]

1. d4 {Game against lanlee i felt was rather interesting and an exciting game for me. I was quite down throughout most part of this game because of how well he was playing in our other game, but was able to overcome this.   He kicked off with d4} d5 {d5} 2. c4 {c4,pawn sacrifice for classic pawn centre, a novel beginning in many a players game} Nf6 {Nf6, declined variation} 3. cxd5 {c takes} Nxd5 {f takes} 4. e4 {e4, a good opening i admit } Nb6 {knight back to b6} 5. Qf3 {queen out early, lots of players avoid this. maybe this will become a weakness} e6 {e6, for castling it also protects d5 in variations an annoying spacial cramp for black} 6. Be3 {be3, eyeing down b6 maybe to wreck my pawns} Bb4+ {bb4 check, the king is fairly exposed, the purpose of this move is time rather than anything else} 7. Bd2 {bd2, a trade off perhaps. what did white leave behind?} Qxd4 {queen takes d4!} 8. Bxb4 {bxb4} Qxb4+ {queen takes..check} 9. Nc3 {nc3,this allows the piece to be pinned. but still allows castling} Qxb2 {queen takes b2.} 10. Rb1 {rook b1} Qa3 {queen a3, my queen can run out of space very quickly, a retreat first to a3 to allow more options} 11. Bb5+ {check, no threat here} Bd7 {threatens trade or retreat, piece advantage for me all trades are welcome } 12. Bxd7+ Nb8xd7 {we traded bishops} 13. Nge2 {getting those pieces out for castling} O-O {castle} 14. O-O {castle} e5 {e5 closing the centre. this is an important blockade of whites central pawns as it gives me space} 15. Rb3 {trying to get a tempo on the queen, but i prepared for this already} Qe7 {Qe7, where it wanted to go anyway. many many moves for my queen to make now} 16. Nd5 {trying to create more tempo on the queen} Nxd5 {this weakens b7 dramatically, but is that a worry for me?} 17. exd5 {pawn takes} Nc5 {knight c5! holds b7 and gains a tempo} 18. Re3 {rook e3 targetting a relatively weak but powerful pawn} Nd7 {back to defense nd7} 19. Qe4 {qe4, places the queen on a more intimidating diagonal} Rae8 {rae8, makes that pawn over defended and a solid hold on the centre} 20. Rh3 {rh3, threatens mate with qxh7} f5 {f5, positions the pawn in a solid position to cramp whites movement and close space around the king. Note that the knight on e2 is very weak for it is limited, as in the queen now} 21. Qb1 {qb1, again threatens b7, while pinning my pawn to f5} b6 {simply b6, nothing special here} 22. g4 {g4! as it seems black is in trouble perhaps with gxf5 as it is pinned , followed by pawn to f6 threatening mate and queen} h6 {h6, stops that mate threat. it does sacrifice a pawn. but i have calculated this position very well now and have reliable counter play} 23. gxf5 {gxf5} Qg5+ {Qg5 check! this allows me to win the pawn back} 24. Rg3 {rg3} Qxf5 {qxf5 back to where we were} 25. Qc1 {Qc1 now threatens c7, i cant move this pawn as it will be taken if i play c6 or enpassant if c5} Nc5 {instead knight to c5, a clever move centralising a knight is always good as it allows a knights maximum potential} 26. Qxh6 {Qxh6! perhaps i didnt see this but this threat is relatively harmless} Qh7 {Qh7} 27. Qg5 {Qg5, most of whites threats now harmless and it is time for more counter play. can you spot the move now?} Ne4 {Ne4!, perhaps white biggest mistake} 28. Qg4 {Qg4} Nxg3 {Nxg3, its very hard for white now} 29. Nxg3 {Nxg3} Qc2 {Qc2, the queen can leave as white hasnt got too many strong moves on the king} 30. Nh5 {Nh5 is no trouble} Rf7 {Rf7 defends and allows me to double my rooks. its all looking very comfortable} 31. f3 {a blunder, exposes the king and white doesnt gain anything from this} Qc5+ {Check! wins white only useful pawn left} 32. Kg2 {Kg2} Qxd5 {Qxd5} 33. Kh3 {Kh3 white is trying to converge his pieces on the king for a final assault} Qe6 {Qe6! forces the trade off} 34. Qxe6 Rxe6 {now white is looking very bleak, he has limited moves} 35. f4 {f4, no concern i move in on the king} Rh6 {pinning the knight to the king} 36. Kg4 {no good here} g6 {g6! simply forces a defender away} 37. Ng3 exf4 {exf4 is now dangerous for if white takes he will have traded off his only rook. 3 very powerful pawns on the queenside are ready to march} 38. Ne4 {ne4. maybe the only useful move in this position} Rxh2 {Rxh2} 39. Kg5 {kg5, the final blunder. Its all over. spot the move? Hint: where can the king move?} Rg2+ {Rg2 and my opponent resigned. Continuation of either h4 or h6 results in a Rh7 mate. same result with knight to g3 which is an insult to injury if played. Perhaps the most important thing learnt from this game is anticipation, calm when under pressure and use of counter play}
