1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {personally, I don't like the sidelines in the Sicilian} g6 4. Bc4 {developing pieces and creating pressure in the center and f7...} Bg7 5. O-O e6 {black has now "holes" in his black squares...} 6. d3 Nge7 7. Bg5 {naturally} f6 8. Bf4 d5 {wants to break in the center but the king is not castled yet...} 9. exd5 exd5 10. Bb5 {with the threat of Re1} O-O 11. d4 {creates an isolated pawn for black.} Nxd4 12. Nxd4 cxd4 13. Qxd4 a6 {not the best move. black needs to remove the white queen from d4 in order to push his pawn forward. the move in the text helps white to put his bishop on b3 and threat d5.} 14. Ba4 b5 15. Bb3 Bb7 16. Rad1 g5 17. Be3 {Bg3...} f5 18. Qd3 f4 19. Bc5 {Bd4 and the blockade remains...} Kh8 20. Nxd5 Ng6 {gives up a rook. arent there other options?} 21. Bxf8 Qxf8 22. Nc7 Rc8 23. Ne6 Qf6 24. Qd7 {White's pressure is huge.} Qe7 25. Nxg7 Qxg7 26. Qxg7+ Kxg7 27. Rd7+ {and the bishops falls too. the end.}
