[Opening "Reti v Dutch (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {This game represents one my best games here at gameknot to date.  It seemed that I was able to see the whole board and generally speaking, played well tactically.  As I write this annotation, I have not utilized computer analysis as I wanted only my thoughts in my brain.  After I complete this annotation, I plan to run this through the computer analysis.  All comments and criticisms are welcome and appreciated.} f5 {I tend to play the Reti as white.  I believe Black responds with the Dutch Defense.} 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 d6 4. d4 {I thought about castling here but I didn't want to give up the center.  Now, if 4...e5 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. Qxd8 Kxd8 7. Nxe5} e6 5. c4 {I feel I still have time to castle and this move provides me some nice Q-side space.} Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. b4 {It appears that White will be attacking Q-side} Qe8 {In preparation of Qh5 and King side activity} 8. Bb2 {I'm not exactly sure why I did this (except that I like a nice fianchetto).  8. Be3 doesn't make sense as it blocks e2.  It may have been because I was planning to connect the Knights.} Nc6 9. b5 {Initially, I thought I was taking space with tempo.  In hindsight, Black likely expected 9. b5 and was heading the N to d8 anyway.} Nd8 10. Nbd2 Qh5 11. e3 {This bolsters d4, although I'm not sure that's necessary.  This also allows my Q to challenged the black Q.} Nf7 12. a4 {I saw nothing better and this provided more Q side space.} g5 {It's getting a bit cramped over by my King.} 13. Ne1 {I was interested to see if Black wanted to exchange Qs.  I thought this might alleviate a bit a pressure and with the Black K-side pawn pushes, Black's King is a bit open.} Qh6 {exchange rejected.} 14. Nd3 {Well, if I'm going to play Q-side, perhaps I should bring my pieces Q-side.  I didn't see an immediate break-thru on my K.} Nh5 {But it's getting a bit dicey.} 15. Qe2 {I'm not sure what my thought was in making this move.  Likely, I wanted to connect White's Rs and didn't want my Queen to far from my King as it appears he may need a defender or two.} Bf6 {Well, that pins d4} 16. a5 {I continue Q-side expansion.} e5 {I thought a bit about this move.  I did not want Black to continue advancing his pawns and I hoped that if I went 17 dxe5, he would retake with the Bishop and we could exchange Bishops as mine was not doing anything at present.  } 17. dxe5 dxe5 18. Nc5 {At this point, I had it figured that I was going to win a pawn.  Obviously, Black cannot move 18...b6  Alternatively, 18...c6  19.	bxc6	b6  20. c7 loses the exchange} g4 19. Nxb7 {After the game, my opponent stated that 19. a6 was the better move and he indicated that this would have won more quickly.  I assume the line would have been 19.a6 b6  20. Bxa8	bxc5} e4 {This move cuts off my LSB protection of Nb7 and directly attacks my DSB, which is en prise.} 20. Bxf6 {This was the only move that made sense to me.} Bxb7 21. a6 {I would have happily exchanged by DSB for Blacks LSB at this point as that would have also led to the loss of the a7 pawn.} Bc8 22. Bd4 Ng5 {At this point I had a good, long think.  Clearly, I have nice space on the Q-side but it appeared only a matter of time until Black broke thru on the King side.  I went thru a variety of variations until I finally came up with a line that pleased me.  My thought was when I went into these moves, the worst I should come up is a point down in material but I would have hopefully minimized Black's K-side pressure.} 23. f3 gxf3 24. Nxf3 {It didn't matter to me which pawn, g or e, that Black retook with, I was taking back with my N.} exf3 25. Rxf3 {And there is the point of this.  If Black moves 25. Nxf4  26. Bxf4 and then if say, 26...Be6 27. Bxh5   If Black doesn't move his LSB, then the Ra8 is lost.} Ne4 {But Black sees all of this and thus White is down one material point.} 26. g4 {After the match my opponent gave an ! to 26. g4   My thought was that Nh5 must move.  Black cannot play 26...fxg4 27. Rxf8+ and no matter how Black retakes, Bxe4  and Ra8 falls as well.} Ng7 27. Raf1 {I had a long think on this move as well.  I could nothing that was immediately "game changing" so I sought to improve my position.  After looking for a bit, I realized that my R on a1 was not part of the game and it appeared that including him helped my position.} Qg6 {Now here, I ran thru a multitude of variations.  However, just about everyone ended up with my LSB pinned to my K and White losing material.  After thinking a bit, I figured I had time to move my K} 28. Kh1 {A primary point was to now insure that Black could never be allowed to move Ng3} c5 {I didn't expect this move but it didn't bother me.  I had run thru several variations where I moved Rf4 but I had difficulty getting around Ne6, attacking Rf4.  I hated giving up the B-pair but it just made sense to me to do so.} 29. Bxg7 Kxg7 30. Rf3f4 {Pinning the Black N for the moment.  All the while, Black still cannot move fxg4} Be6 {I believe that Black was thinking to attack the base of my pawn chain while also freeing the pin on his N.} 31. gxf5 {I was quite pleased with this move and what came next.  I could not see how Black could refuse to respond 31...Bxf5.  At this point, His N is en prise, so moving Qh6 would only lose the N (White would have to take the N because otherwise 32. fxe6??  Ng3+ and it's game over.)} Bxf5 32. Rg1 {I was pleased I found this--With White's next move, 33. Bxe4, either the Q will be pinned to the K or it will be discovered check.} Rae8 {Black sees this as well and it's time to exchange off a bunch of pieces.} 33. Bxe4 Bxe4+ 34. Rxe4 Rxe4 35. Rxg6+ hxg6 {And now it's a Q v 2 Rooks.  I figured with my Q-side pawn advance, I should be able to obtain at least a draw.} 36. Kg2 {My first thought is to bring my K into the action.  I had two hopes at this point:  exchange my Q for the Rooks or find a way to take a7.} Rfe8 37. Kf3 {Please, please, take e3.} Re4e6 {I didn't think so, but a man has to have dreams.} 38. Qd3 Re6e5 {Here it seems to me that Black is playing for a draw.} 39. h4 {My thought was to prevent g5 from pushing forward and creating complication.} Re8e6 40. e4 {Taking space and still trying to figure out how to take a7} Re6e7 41. Kf4 Kf7 {Time for another long think.  I could not come up with a variation where I could get my Q to take a7 and I began to seriously consider that this game was drawn.  I was in a similar game about a week or so before this and did not consider pushing my pawns.  I took a draw in that game when analysis showed I had a win.  Therefore...} 42. b6 {I found this move!  There are a variety of variations but with correct play, at best, Black was going to lose a rook.} axb6 43. a7 Re5xe4+ 44. Qxe4 Rxa7 {And now, with careful play, White should win.} 45. Qc6 {This removes b6} Kg7 46. Qxb6 Rf7+ 47. Kg4 Rf5 48. Qe6 {My thought was to slowly squeeze the King.  I was thinking that once I got rid of g6, I'd exchange Q for R and either h4 or c4 would Queen.} Rh5 49. Qe7+ Kg8 50. Qf6 Kh7 51. Qf7+ Kh8 52. Qxg6 {All according to plan...} Rxh4+ {And Black lays a trap.  If Kxh4, the game is a draw--stalemate.} 53. Kg3 Rh3+ 54. Kf4 {And Black resigns.  My thanks to my opponent and his after-game comments.  Any comments, suggestions, or criticisms are most welcome and appreciated.}
