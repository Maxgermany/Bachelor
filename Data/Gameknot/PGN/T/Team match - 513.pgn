1. e4 e5 2. d3 {Not a good developing move a this point.  It surrenders the tempo to Black } Nc6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 {Better would be exd5.} Bb4 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 d4 {Big mistake!  this surrenders control of the center to white after the exchange, cxd4,  exd4. } 7. c4 {Missed the point,  the exchange would have given control to White.} Nf6 8. Nh4 {Very bad move.  Black can play Nxe4, dxe4 then Qxh4 wining a Knight!} O-O {Black missed the play to win the knight.} 9. Qf3 Bg4 10. Qg3 Qd7 11. h3 Bh5 12. Bh6 Bg4 {Fatal mistake.  Move should have been Ne8 } 13.
