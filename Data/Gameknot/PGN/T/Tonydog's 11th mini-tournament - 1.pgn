1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {In things like League or Ladder games, I vary my openings. But in tournament or mini-tournament games I usually stick to more Classical lines, as in this game.} Nc6 3. Bb5 {Yet another Ruy Lopez. :)} Nf6 4. O-O {Book.} Nxe4 5. d4 {The Open Variation.} Nxd4 6. Nxd4 {A pseudo-sacrifice, as the pin on the K file wins back the Knight at once.} exd4 7. Re1 {The pin in question.} c6 8. Rxe4+ {The capture with check allows time...} Be7 9. Bd3 {...for the B to escape as well.} d5 10. Re1 {The fireworks are over for the moment, and I have a small material advantage. Time to develop that Q-side.} O-O 11. Bf4 {The best spot.} Bd6 12. Bxd6 {Since I'm ahead in material, I don't at all mind exchanges.} Qxd6 13. Nd2 {The last minor piece clears the rank...} b6 14. Qf3 {...and development is finished, as my Rooks are connected.} f5 15. Re2 {Preparing...} Bd7 16. Rae1 {..to double on the open file.} Rae8 17. Re2xe8 {If Black now plays 17... RxR, I happily swap off the last Rooks with 18 RxR ch BxR and with 19 BxP I have a technically easy endgame win with my extra minor piece. } Bxe8 18. Qh3 {So that I can play...} Qh6 19. Bxf5 {...this move without moving into a self-pin. 19... QxQ 20 BxQ would let me win slowly but surely.} Qxd2 20. Bxh7+ {Now I win quickly. Black's only way to fight on is 20... K-R1 21 B-N6 dis ch Q-R3 22 QxQ ch PxQ 23 BxB, after which I have an easy endgame win but Black can drag out his resistance for a while.} Kf7 21. Qe6# {Black's actual move enables me to end it right here.}
