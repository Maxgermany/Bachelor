1. e4 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. Ne2 e6 6. Nbc3 Nge7 7. O-O O-O 8. d3 d6 9. a3 a6 10. Rb1 Rb8 11. b4 cxb4 12. axb4 b5 13. cxb5 axb5 14. Be3 {White has the initiative, and plans 15. d4. Black can not wait quietly, and must do something. 15...f5? is weak do to 16 f4, with clear advantage to white. 15.... d5 was possible, and maybe was better than the actual move of the game. } e5 15. d4 Qe8 {A mistake! I didn´t see white´s  strong reply. But it is not so easy to see in this position that when the pawn on d6 moves, the diagonal c5--f8 lies open to the very strong white bishop, pinning the night e7 on the rook f8.  The reason for this move is to leave d8 free for the c6 knight. I expected    16 d5 Ke8 with a good game for black! } 16. dxe5 { Very strong!} dxe5 17. Bc5 f6 { Only move! If 17......f5 18 Qb3  Kh8 19 exf5 Rxf5 20 Rfd1 Qf7 Rd6! With overwhelming  position for White} 18. Nd5 {The best. If 18 Rc1 Be6  greatly reduces white advantage } Rf7 { Only move} 19. Nec3 { Again the best.} Nxd5 {I see no other options, black must exchange some pieces to relief it´s squashed position.} 20. exd5 {Again the Best! Bold and strong. If 20 Nxd5? Be6 gives black a good game} Nd8 { Possibly this was a bad move. The position is very complex. Probably 20...Ne7 was better, but I am not still sure.} 21. d6 {Again the best! Very strong and bold.  If 21 Qe2, either 21....f5 or (probably better) 21...Bd7 give black a good game . } Bd7 {White stands better. Now black´s best hope is to play at some point, n.... f5; n1....e4, give life to the g7 Bishop, exchange pieces, and exploit the d6 pawn, that is likely to become a weakness, when there are few pieces on the board.   Nevertheless, 21... f5 immediately is too dangerous. E.g. 21....f5 22. Nd5 threatening both 23 Nc7  followed by 24 Bd5 (winning at least the exchange) and 23 Ne7   followed 24 Ba7, again winning the exchange, this time capturing the other rook. If 22 ....e4? 23 Ne7  and 24 f3, with great advantage to white. If 22 ....Qd7 23 Ra1 followed by 24 Ra7, and white´s initiative is difficult to stop. I couldn´t find a saving move for black.   On the other hand, 21 ....Nb7 was possible and maybe better than the game´s move. Could follow 22 Ra1 f5 23 Bb6 e4 25 Bxb8 Bxa1 26 Qxa1 Be6. } 22. Bd5 {A mistake (white's first, in my rumble understanding). 22 Kd5 was very strong, and would keep black in a very difficult position. Black can play neither 22 ....Nc6? because of 23. Nc7 followed by 24. Bd5 winning; nor 22....Be6 because of 23. Ne7  followed by 24. Ba7, also winning. The best hope would be 22....Ne6, and white could keep the pressure e.g. with 23 Ra1. The miserable black’s b8 rook is threatened by all sides, and can´t find a good position. With the games move, black begins to see light in the end of the tunnel} Be6 {Only move. 22.... Ne6? is answered by 23 Qb3, with a clear advantage for white.} 23. Qe2 {The best. 23 f4 would be answered by 23......f5, threatening 24.....e4. So 24 fxe5 Bxe5. And now either 25 Qb3 or 25 Re1 are answered by 25.....Bxc3, eliminating the dangerous Knight, and leaving black with the better position, due to the d6 pawn, that will gradually become a weakness.   The game’s move increases the pressure on the d file and the b5 pawn. } f5 {Now that black could breath, it is time to star the plan n....f5; and when possible, n2.....e4} 24. Rbc1 {Another imprecision. The only way to avoid the freeing move 24.....e4, was 24 Rfe1!, with a complex game. White would threaten to gain the a file, which, combined with the strong activity of the minor pieces would win the b5 pawn or one exchange, and win the game. Black would have to answer 24......Bxd5 25 Nxd5. And now Black has two possibilities, the less risky 25....Rfb7, defending b5 and contra balancing white future activity on  the a file. And 25.....Ne6, with an unclear game. } e4 {Finally! The idea now is to eliminate the dangerous Nc3, which is central to white´s possibilities to create threatens with the d6 pan. Without the white Knight on board, the pawn starts already to become week.} 25. Rfd1 Bxc3 26. Bxe6 {To me this looks a Good move! But Detoxer said he is not sure about it, he maybe prefers 26. Rxc3 instead. I would have answered To 26 Rxc3 with 26......Bxd5, and I think the white rook is not well placed on d5. E.g. 27.... Nc6 28 Rd1 Ne5 with an about equal game.} Nxe6 {Also possible is 26....Qxe6 27 Rxc3 Rd7 28 f3 Nf7 29 fxe4 Ng5 and now if 30 e5 Ne4 with an equal game.} 27. Rxc3 Ng5 {The Knight starts an epic journey to d3. If it gets there safely, black will have the better game. So white must play 28 Kh1! avoiding  28.....Nf3? due to the decisive 29. Qa2! threatening both a)  the maneuver 30.Ra3 and 31. Rb7 or (if the black rook leaves b8,) 31 Rb8  ; and b) 30 Qd5. Black has no way to defend the position. E.g. 29 .....Qd7 30. Ra3 Rb7 31 Ra8  Kg7 32 Qb2  Rf6 33 Be3 threatening 34 Rf8 Kxf8 35 Qxf6  Kg8 Ra1 and winning. or  29....Ne5. 30 Qd5 Rd8 31 Ra3 Nc4 32 Ra7 winning (32....Kg2 33. d7)  In face of all that, after 28 Kh1! black would play 28....Rd7, with an unclear game. } 28. Ra3 {A mistake, see comment to black's 27th move. Now the Knight will reach a very strong position, and give black the upper hand.} Nf3+ 29. Kh1 Ne5 30. Ra7 {Also possible was 30 Qa2 Nc4 31. Ra6 Rd7 with slight advantage for black. } Rxa7 31. Bxa7 Rb7 {The b pawn still has to be defended, and that shows the strength of the white´s 23th move (Qe2).  Now other moves for black would be bad. E.g.  31.....Rd8? 32 Bb6 or 31..... Rc8? 32 Rd5. } 32. Qa2+ {It is not clear to me if this move is bad.  Detoxer also is not so sure about it, and told me that considers maybe Qe3 better. But nothing is so clear since the black position is already slightly better, and the game’s move kept white with drawing chances.  Detoxer takes 32 Qe3 into consideration, but black could have followed 32....Qc6 33 Bc5 Rd7! and now if 34 Qd4 e3 , with clear advantage for black.  Maybe 32 Ra1 Qc6 33. Bc5 Nc4 was better, but black still has slight advantage. } Qf7 33. Qa1 { Only move, but strong. Any exchange of queens here (on f7 or a2) is hopeless for white.} Nd3 {Obviously, to exchange the Knight for the Bishop would be a BLUNDER. It is the lack of ability of the bishop to help the d6 pawn to advance that makes that pawn weak. If the small pieces disappear from the board, all of the sudden the pawn gets renewed strength, and that combined with the exposed black king’s position would leave white with the better game. Besides that, black must be VERY CAREFUL, because the weakness on the dark squares, specially the a1-h8 diagonal, combined with the weakness of the 8 line, can generate mating possibilities for white. E.g. 33.....Nc4 34 Bc5 Qe8 (to defend the 8 line) 35 Qd4 Rd7, but now 36 Qd5  (threatening Ra1) Qf7 (only move) and now white is clearly better, and can play either 37 Qa8 or 37 Qc6. } 34. Bc5 Rb8 {Necessary, to defend the 8 file.} 35. Qd4 { Otherwise, 35.....Qd5 with clear advantage.} Qc4 36. Qf6 {White can not take on c4, because it leads to a lost ending, as in the game. But 36.Qe3 was a very interesting option, with the plan to play for draw, and very strong chances of getting it, for with the rook on d7 (defending f2) and the queen on e3 defending c5, it is not easy to see a breakthrough for black.} Qf7 {Here there is a very subtle detail. Black could have played 36.....Qd5, and after the forced 37.Kg1 (otherwise black wins immediately ) 37....Qf7. But that would have been a mistake, because it would have strengthened white’s position. The present position of the white King on h1, and the debility of the f2 pawn can be exploited not only by the Queen, but also by the Knight. So it was very important to leave the W. King there, as will be seen in the game on white’s 40th move. } 37. Qd4 {Again, white can not exchange queens, for the ending is strongly favorable to black.} Ra8 {After an almost lost position on move 21, black could be tempted to go for the draw with 37.....Qc4. We are lucky when we can see the changes in the balance of the game, for it is so easy to stay with some strong situation (as whites advantage on move 21) frozen in the mind. (Especially in real time, on the board, games). But now it is black who has the upper hand.   } 38. h3 Qc4 {This gives white a drawing possibility, but I could not find anything better. The position is a lot trickier than it looks at first glance. E.g. 38...Qb3 is dangerous. 39 Kh2! and now black has no way to continue with the initiative:  39.....Dxd1?? looses to 40 Qd5  39.....Ra2?? looses to 40 d7 39.....Rf1?? looses to 40 d7 so black would have to play 39....Qc4, with a worsened position (for the white king is better at h2. } 39. Qxc4+ {I didn't understand why my strong opponent took the queen, entering a clear lost ending. After 39. Qf6 the position is still extremely complex: If black tries to force the win with 39....Qb3???, he looses to 40 Rxd3! followed by Bd4 and mate.   If 39....Qd5?? 40 Bd4 threatening mate and winning., The only possible try would be the risky and cloudy move 39....Nxc5 40 bxc5 Qb3 with a complex position. With the game's move, white is clearly lost. } bxc4 40. Rd2 Ra1+ 41. Kh2 Ne1 42. h4 Nf3+ 43. Kh3 Nxd2 44. b5 c3 45. d7 Ra8 46. b6 c2 47. Ba3 Nb3 48. b7 Rd8 49. h5 c1=Q 50. Bxc1 Nxc1 51. hxg6 {I congratulate my opponent, Detoxer, for a very fine game. The most interesting I have played in GameKnot so far. I was first lucky to escape a miserable defeat on the early middle game, then still luckier to win, but will take more care on such symmetric positions on the future.}
