[Opening "King's Indian (A48), London system"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Please not another Queens Gambit! I've had enough.} 2. Nf3 g6 {East Indian Defense.} 3. Bf4 Bg7 {I believe this is called the East Indian defense London system?} 4. e3 d5 5. Be2 O-O 6. h3 c5 {Striking the centre. Nothing interesting happens over the next few moves.} 7. c3 a6 8. a4 {Trying to prevent b5} Nc6 9. Nbd2 Re8 10. dxc5 {Now he captures. He is clearly a pawn up although i may have aa slight lead in development.} a5 {Trying to soften his pawn chain if he ever plays b4} 11. Qb3 Bf5 12. Qxb7 {NOw he's 2 pawns up for nothing.} Qd7 13. Qb3 e5 14. Bxe5 Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Rxe5 {He just sacs a piece for a pawn. It doesn't really matter for him as he does have 3 pawns for the piece.} 16. Bb5 Qc7 17. c6 Ne4 {His idea was to capture all the pawns so it would allow his a file, b file and c file pawns to promote.} 18. Nxe4 Rxe4 {Another blunder as he now has 4 pawn for the piece!} 19. Qxd5 Rd8 20. Qc5 Re5 21. Qc4 Be6 {harassing the queen.} 22. Qf4 Qd6 23. O-O h6 24. Rad1 {This was the moment when i thought I had a chance to equalise. 2 rooks are usually better than a queen and in this position I think the rooks win.} Qxd1 25. Rxd1 Rxd1+ 26. Kh2 {This wasn't forced. He could've played bishop f1 but i could've exerted tonnes of pressure on it.} Rg5 {Prepares for the sneaky Be5 which pins the Queen and King.Best here would Qg3 or any other light square.} 27. Bc4 {Howcome he didn't advance his pawn on c6. If he did it surely would've been crushing. He iffers the exchange of bishops.} Be5 {He reisgns now. I will have 2 rooks against 4 pawns and that would be too easy for me.}
