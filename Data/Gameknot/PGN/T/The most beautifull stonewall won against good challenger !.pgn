1. d4 {so i will prepare my stonewall easily...} Nf6 2. e3 e6 3. Bd3 d5 {for the moment, nothing special whith blacks, they develop, so so i do !} 4. f4 Nc6 {at this moment, ihave a risk:if i go on developping the g knight to f3, they can attack my d3 bishop whith the knight. This is very embarasting for stonewall because the bishop is very important in this attack.  i take the risk to keep speed development, so instead  of moving c3 to stop any black knight in b4, i just go on developing the g knight} 5. Nf3 Nb4 {so here we are ! bloody knight whant to kill my plans. I have the idea to move first my bishop to b5, so he will have2 options : moving c7 and block the knight, or move back his knight!} 6. Bb5+ c6 {blocking the kniht, i will kick it !} 7. Be2 {loosing some tempo anyway, but my bishop is still active there} a5 {for nothing} 8. c3 {finishing my stonewall attack} Na6 {now i can double his paw on a colon exchanging bishop whith knight, but i have better to do whith my bishop} 9. O-O h6 {passive move, has no interest} 10. Qe1 {preraring the attack...} Bd7 {maybe he waspreparing to castle in queen side ?} 11. Nbd2 {now i can attack ...} b5 12. a3 {first anticipate b4} Nc7 13. Ne5 {here we are ! } Bd6 14. Qg3 {threath on g7, he will sure castle !} O-O {now his king is mine !} 15. Bd3 {going back to his attack position} Be8 {to late black sir !} 16. Qh3 Be7 {for nothing...} 17. g4 {here i am !!!} Nh7 {no enought} 18. g5 {so what whould you do now ? any idea?} g6 {certainely no this ! loosing move} 19.
