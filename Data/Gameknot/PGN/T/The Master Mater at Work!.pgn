1. Nc3 {Hi everyone!  After I lost another game to Freddy (yes, you've guessed it - I got Freddied again!), I will be annotating that one soon - I thought I would do some homework on him - he is dubbed the Master Mater among some of us U1900 players.  Freddy's unfortunate opponent here who had a starting rating of 1860 was a fellow Sneaky Knight member.  I thought I would annotate this because it included a successful queen sac and mating attack from Freddy, always worth annotating that.  Freddy kicks off with his favourite opening, the Dunst with 1. Nc3.} e6 2. e4 d5 3. d4 {3. d4 - Freddy decided to consolidate the centre by playing d4.} Bb4 4. e5 {4. e5 - a bit of a cross-breed this position, like an Advanced Winawer French Defense.} Qd7 {4. ....... Qd7 - mmm, shuts in black's dsb.} 5. Qg4 Bf8 {5. ...... Bf8 - black's development goes into reverse.} 6. Nh3 {6. Nh3 - Freddy has developed his knight to this square in some of my games before.  Although the knight is on the rim it can go to f4 or g5.} Ne7 {6. ...... Ne7 - development but it hems in black's dsb.} 7. Nf4 g6 {7. ...... g6 - black plans to fianchetto his dsb.} 8. Be3 {8. Be3 - Freddy clears the decks, he is now ready to castle queenside.  This bishop move also supports the d4 pawn and points at h6 with possibilities of exchanging off black's dsb and exploiting the holes should black choose to castle there.} Nf5 {8. ...... Nf5 - good move - puts knight on a more active square and black has the option of moving his bishop back to b4 or to put it on g7.  On balance, despite my previous note I think g7 is the better choice.  Black now starts a pawn roll, hoping that white will castle kingside with 9. h5.} 9. Bd3 h5 10. Qe2 Ne7 11. Qf3 Nf5 {11. ...... Nf5 - strange knight manoeuvres over the last two moves.  Maybe Nc6 may have been a better plan here - clear the decks I say!} 12. Bxf5 gxf5 {12. ....... gxf5 - leaves the g file wide open for Freddy, but how can he exploit it?  Black no doubt would have liked to have put a rook on g8 but unfortunately for him the h pawn is hanging.  It would be very dangerous for black to castle kingside here and his queenside is clogged up.  The centre is very solid so the BK looks safe, but white is Master Freddy!} 13. Nxh5 {13. Nxh5 - the h pawn falls anyway.  Oh look, nasty, nasty, Freddy's horsie is threatening to come to f6 and fork the BK and the BQ!} Be7 {13. ...... Be7 - black must now develop his bishop to e7 preventing that royal fork.} 14. h4 Rg8 {14. ....... Rg8 - I think I would have played that move, but Freddy now weighs in with 15. Bg5! which threatens and exchange of dsb's followed by that knight fork in my previous note.} 15. Bg5 Rg6 16. Nf6+ {16. Nf6+ - Freddy gets the fork in anyway.} Bxf6 17. Bxf6 Nc6 {17. ....... Nc6 - the queen knight develops at last, but black cannot castle queenside as Freddy's dsb is nicely anchored on f6 - that is even if black manages to get that lsb out!} 18. h5 Nxd4 {18. ....... Nxd4 - this seems a reasonable try, grab a pawn and attack the enemy queen and make way for his own queen to come out, but with that passed h pawn I am not sure that was a good idea.  Maybe Rh6 and if Bg5 then Rh7, blocking the h file followed by Ne7, blocking out the white dsb and adding a defense to g8, this would enable black to play a move like b6 then Bb7 then 0-0-0.  Black never gets the chance to do this however.  Freddy now does something absolutely surprising ........ wait for it ........} 19. hxg6 {19. hxg6!!!! - here it is, here it is, a brilliant queen sacrifice.  Note that the h file is open and a white rook can go to h8 and surely this is mate?} Nxf3+ 20. Ke2 Nd4+ 21. Kd3 {21. Kd3 - the WK evades the knight's checks.  Black creates a flight square by capturing the g6 pawn.} fxg6 22. Rh8+ {22. Rh8+ - The BK's only legal move is to f7.  Freddy could win back his queen here, but he is after the BK which cannot run away.  Freddy now doubles rooks on the h file.} Kf7 23. Rah1 g5 {23. ....... g5 - the only move to avoid immediate mate (Rh7#).} 24. Rh1h7+ Kg6 25. Rh7h5 {25. Rh5 - Freddy restricts the BK and does not bother to take the BQ.  Black tries to protect g5 with Nf3 but as there is a pawn on g2 this protection does not last.} Nf3 26. gxf3 Qe8 {26. ....... Qe8 - I think I would have chosen Qc6 as my token move here as mate is unavoidable.} 27. Rxg5+ Kf7 28. Rg7# {28. Rg7# - a brilliant linear mate.  Well played Freddy!}
