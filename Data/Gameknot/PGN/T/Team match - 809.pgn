1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O {A relatively common way to start a chess game. When you look in the chess database on GK(which I use bery much) it is always the first or the second move people use. Most of the time white answers with Be2(4101 times) but I answered with Bg5(203 times) I give relatively often one of my bishops for a knight. And evermore, I have something hearth that you in this way get a better standing of the pawns.} 6. Bg5 {This is called the King's Indian, Zinnowitz variation. It is already 203 times palyed on gameknot. It has a little advantage for white, according to the gameknot online chess database.} c5 {relatively unuseful answer. I think I thinks the bishop and the knight are not interesting and he wanted a beautiful row of pawns:P Most useful and with the most adventage for black is h6, according to the GK database. I think so, but I cant good explain the reason.} 7. dxc5 {Of course I take the pawn.(which is relativlly uncommon, with 4 times(d5 28 times))} dxc5 {And of course he takes revenge.} 8. Qxd8 {Yippie, I can take his queen!!!! PARTYTIME!!!!} Rxd8 {Yes, he takes revenge, and know we are equal again.} 9. e5 {This is 3 times happened on GK, according to the chess database and all 3 times, white did e5!! So you can attack the knight at f6 and the knight at f6 dont attack the pawn at the moment and now the knight at f3 is defending the pawn. So it is a good move.} Nfd7 {He is running away for the pawn and trying to attack it again. Until this is called the kings indian, zinnowitz variation. Until this move it is 3 times earlier played on GK. For move 10 they have done all 3 an other move.} 10. O-O-O {Until so far it is played a time earlier. The king now has a shelter and the rook now is attacking the knight.} Nc6 {But black answer this move on an other wise(as the game in the database). I should do this move too, to attack the pawn for the second time.} 11. Nd5 {preparation of the 13th move. Look very very good. Do you see a plan to mate him(in three moves)???? Here we go. Try to understand!!} Ndxe5 {he gets the pawn(I think he didnt see my plan)} 12. Nxe5 {my defending knight gets the knight} Nxe5 {he can do this move due to 10......Nc6  He has now a material gain of  1} 13. Nxe7+ {But I am not crazy, I get that 1 point back and I get a fork too, between the bishop and the king.(this is possible due to the 11th move) This is the preparing move for the checkmate. Now you must see the possibilitie to mate in 1 move!! Here we go!} Kf8 {He cant do something else} 14. Rxd8# {And now, I get the rook, and it is all over. It is checkmate :D}
