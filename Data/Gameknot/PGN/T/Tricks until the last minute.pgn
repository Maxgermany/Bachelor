[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Yusupov-Rubinstein system"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 {Uncommitted opening. } 3. e3 c5 4. c3 {White wants to stall the game, apparently. } Qc7 {This is kind of a stupid move. The idea is to push the pawn on c4, so to "squeeze" white. } 5. Nbd2 {White stops it, I ignore if he saw it or not. } Bd6 {Weird, but I planned to try to attack with the fianchettoed lsb. } 6. Bd3 {White could have played e4 now, and I'll be in slight troubles. } a6 {Wanting to push c4 by force, I prepare the advance pawn. Pretty a stupid plan, I realize now. } 7. O-O {White is obviously in no hurry to expand. } b5 8. Ne4 {At last. But better was the pawn. } Nxe4 9. Bxe4 Nc6 {I stopped it with the knight, since I was not sure I wanted to castle queenside. And I wanted to avoid exchange lsbs until I have a shadow of an attack with the batteries pointed at the white king. } 10. Bd2 {White is in no hurry again. } f5 11. Bd3 c4 {I couldn't resist. A "squeezed" position is not necessarily easy to break, though. } 12. Be2 Bb7 {The only useful place for my bishop. } 13. h3 {White smells the danger. } h6 {Preparing g5. I can spend a lot of moves on pawn's expansion, given the passive game by white. But wait. } 14. Qc2 g5 15. Ne1 {Wow! Hipepassive defence. But there is no obvious way to penetrate white's king, since Bh2 doesn't help!} O-O-O {Let's bring more firepower to the fry. } 16. a4 {At last, white "awakens". I am betting his attack won't go anywhere. } h5 {I need another pawn in order to break in g4. } 17. b3 {Now, white is getting me nervous. } Na5 {Maybe better the move before. } 18. bxc4 bxc4 {I think this is goos. Keeps the knight in there, supports my knight on b3, and makes it difficult for white to sum firepower to the b column. } 19. Bf3 {I had lost my chance to use the bishop pair. } Bxf3 20. Nxf3 g4 21. Ng5 {The idea was to win tempoes with the knight retreat, but he dares to put it here. Now I miss the good contination, but Nf7 was in sight. } Rdg8 {Now, white's move is Nf7, where Rh7, NxB and my attack vanishes. } 22. h4 {But hey, look at the guy! This knight has become a nightmare, just as mine for him. } Nb3 23. Ra2 {No need to exchange the bishop, now useless, for a fantastic outpost over there. Ok, but now is time to prove I have some power. } Bh2+ 24. Kh1 Bg3 {Well, let's try a sac. It was wrong. } 25. fxg3 Qxg3 26. Be1 {Because of this. Now, I have lost a piece for a pawn. } Qxe3 {or two. Anyway, to open white's position is not good. } 27. Qe2 {White wants to play safe, and the queen's exchange is almost unavoidable. } Qxe2 28. Rxe2 {Now, I am only -1, but the position is tricky. } Nc1 {I tried a knight adventure to d3, but... what for?} 29. Bg3 {White blundered here. A pity, the game was interesting, indeed. } Nxe2 30. Be1 g3 {...but I miscalculated and returned the courtesy. This loses the knight. Better was Nf1 and back to b3 - untouchable. } 31. Bd2 Rgf8 {The same oversight, but worse. } 32. Re1 Nxd4 33. cxd4 {A shame. I'm still +2, but...} f4 34. Re5 Kb7 {Rc5+ was threatened, taking my c pawn. } 35. Bb4 Rfc8 {Thank you white. I cannot make use of my rook, anyway. I couldn't be sure about RxN, in order to push the h pawn. } 36. Bc5 c3 {A trick. } 37. Re2 c2 {Did you get it? Ok. Now tell me why it is not working. } 38. Rxc2 d6 {The trick. } 39. Rb2+ {The reason it doesn't work. } Kc6 40. Rb6+ Kd5 41. Rxd6+ Kc4 42. Rxe6 {Well well, now I am -1. Good job, white, boo to black. } Rhe8 {The best move here was Rb8. White has to stop a backrank mate, and if he doesn't want to play the knight to stop it and keep pinned, he has to block the b and e column. This way, is better for him. } 43. Rxe8 {He must exchange, or I will go Rb8.} Rxe8 44. Nf3 {The threat is still "on". } Rb8 {...now. } 45. a5 {Well, he wants to block the rook with the bishop, but it's too late. } Rb1+ 46. Ng1 Ra1 47. Bb6 {Ok, I couldn't avoid it. Now, I have to think about how to take advantage of my advanced pawns. And you have to look for "unnatural moves". } f3 {I don't know if it is sound or not, but I play blitz to have fun. } 48. gxf3 Ra2 {Let's see how can white escape from losing a piece or be mated. Nh3, Rh2+, Kg1, RxN, Kg2, Rxh4, Kxg3, and the rook escapes. The game is not won, but...} 49. f4 {He didn't see it. A pity. } Rh2# {}
