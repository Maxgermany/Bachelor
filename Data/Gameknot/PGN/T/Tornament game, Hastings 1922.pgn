1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3. g3 e6 {Alekhine meets Bogoljuboff's QP opening with the Dutch defense.} 4. Bg2 Bb4+ {The more flexible 4... B-K2 is in common use now. However, 90 years ago people still attacked immediately -- and Alekhine is never one to shy away from an attacking move.} 5. Bd2 Bxd2+ 6. Nxd2 {6 QxB would appear more natural and allow the later development of the QN to QB3. But what do I know? I'm a 1300 player. I'm sure Bogoljuboff had a good reason for this move.} Nc6 7. Ngf3 O-O 8. O-O {Both men castle their Kings into safety.} d6 9. Qb3 Kh8 {Moving the K off the diagonal occupied by Bogoljuboff's Q, preventing any later threats along that line.} 10. Qc3 e5 11. e3 a5 {Since Alekhine's position is tilted towards the K-side, he tries to preemptively restrain a potential Bogoljuboff advance on the Q-side.} 12. b3 Qe8 13. a3 Qh5 {The usual Black break in this opening.} 14. h4 Ng4 15. Ng5 Bd7 16. f3 {Forcing back the Knight.} Nf6 17. f4 e4 {Bogoljuboff's KB is now almost useless. To free it would require the time consuming maneuver KR-K1, B-B1, B-K2 and B-Q1.} 18. Rfd1 h6 19. Nh3 {Now Bogoljuboff's KN is restricted as well.} d5 20. Nf1 Ne7 21. a4 Nc6 {Threatening to seize the outpost at Black's QN5.} 22. Rd2 Nb4 23. Bh1 Qe8 {Switching the attack to a new area.} 24. Rg2 dxc4 {With Alekhine's spatial advantage, he wants to open some lines and penetrate the White position. [Also, the move wins a Pawn.]} 25. bxc4 Bxa4 26. Nf2 Bd7 27. Nd2 b5 {Alekhine is continuing to seize space. With a positional and material advantage, it's now a matter of technique.} 28. Nd1 Nd3 {Adolph Anderssen once remarked about Knights posted on the sixth rank that "they are like a rusty nail in your knee!" Or a bone in your throat -- pick your metaphor.} 29. Rxa5 b4 30. Rxa8 bxc3 {This brilliant move proves to be decisive.} 31. Rxe8 c2 {Bogoljuboff can win the other Rook but cannot stop the Pawn from becoming a Queen.} 32. Rxf8+ Kh7 33. Nf2 c1=Q+ 34. Nf1 Ne1 {White's huddled pieces are more of a hindrance than a help.} 35. Rh2 Qxc4 36. Rb8 {Hastening the Rook back into the game. But Alekhine has a trick worth two of that.} Bb5 {Forcing Bogoljuboff to lose the Exchange or be mated.} 37. Rxb5 Qxb5 38. g4 {Trying to create some maneuvering room.} Nf3+ 39. Bxf3 exf3 40. gxf5 Qe2 {Keeping Bogoljuboff completely restrained.} 41. d5 Kg8 42. h5 Kh7 43. e4 {Bogoljuboff is forced to give up a Pawn to obtain some freedom of movement.} Nxe4 44. Nxe4 Qxe4 {Now the White Pawns must fall, one by one.} 45. d6 cxd6 46. f6 gxf6 47. Rd2 Qe2 {Exact. 47... QxP would let Bogoljuboff's Rook become active.} 48. Rxe2 {Forced.} fxe2 49. Kf2 exf1=Q+ 50. Kxf1 Kg7 {Alekhine has an easy win with his passed QP.} 51. Ke2 Kf7 52. Ke3 Ke6 53. Ke4 d5+ {Bogoljuboff resigns. The continuation would be 54 K-Q4 K-B4 55 KxP KxP 56 K-Q4 P-B4 57 K-Q3 K-N6, and the BP marches in to become a Q.}
