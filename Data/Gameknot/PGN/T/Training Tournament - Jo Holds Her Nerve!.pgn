1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This game was even Steven until fairly late on in the middlegame where I found I had a tactical shot which won me the exchange.  This incident occurred the day after Black Friday (the day my rating dropped by 40 odd points).  Luckily I managed to find a way to convert the exchange advantage to a victory and kept my mits off that Offer Draw button!  In response to my 1. e4 black plays the French Defense with 1. e6.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {3. ...... This pawn trade characterises this opening as the French Defense Exchange Variation.} 4. Nf3 Bd6 5. c4 c6 6. cxd5 cxd5 {6. ....... cxd5 - another pawn trade leaving us both with d pawn isolanis.} 7. Nc3 Ne7 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {9. ...... Qxd7 - bishop trade.} 10. O-O O-O 11. Qb3 {11. Qb3 - Glenda hits out at d4 and b7, both squares are protected at the moment but somehow Glenda is in the mood to put those squares under some pressure.} Nbc6 12. Kh1 Bb4 13. Be3 {13. Be3 - Fou Lenoir develops and adds protection to my isolated d pawn.} Rac8 14. Rac1 a6 15. Na4 {15. Na4 - not much doing here, I try to make something happen.  Something does happen, the Wicked Witch of the West makes her appearance on f5 sssss, booo, ssss!} Qf5 16. Nb6 Rcd8 {16. ....... Rcd8 - defending his isolated d pawn.} 17. Rfd1 h6 18. Na4 Qe4 19. Nc5 Bxc5 20. Rxc5 {20. Rxc5 - a N for B trade.} b5 21. a3 Rd6 22. Qd3 Qxd3 23. Rxd3 {23. Rxd3 - queen trade.} Na5 24. b3 {24. b3 - to prevent Nc5.} Rfd8 {24. ...... Rfd8?? - this move is about to drop the exchange as you will soon see with my next move .....} 25. Bf4 {25. Bf4 - this is the light in a very dark tunnel for me.  I had just got out of bed on Saturday morning hoping Black Friday was just a bad dream.  It was not.  My new rating of 1809 (after it had been 1857 made ghastly reading).  Suddenly I saw how black's a5 knight and d8 rook lined up and also his d6 rook lined up then I thought .... Fou Lenoir ...... skewer ...... fork ...... exchange up!  Aha, if only I can hold my nerve and pull this one off this may be the crucial difference between retaining and losing my Class A status.} Re6 {25. ...... Re6 - When I mentioned "Skewer" I bet you thought, what is she talking about?  Well, the d6 rook is not skewered to another piece but the c7 square where Fou Lenoir will land the .....} 26. Bc7 {26. Bc7 ..... fork.} Nb7 27. Bxd8 Nxd8 {27. ..... Nxd8 - and I am now the exchange up but where do I go from here?} 28. Re3 {28. Re3 - I know, force an exchange of black's remaining major piece.} Rxe3 29. fxe3 {29. fxe3 - the rook trade was forced because black's knight would have been left hanging had the rook moved off the e column.} Ndc6 30. b4 {30. b4 - I do not wish to allow Na5.} f6 {30. ...... f6 - he is trying to get his king over to e6/d6 to protect his d5 pawn.  How can I make headway.  Can I distract him?} 31. Nh4 {31. Nh4 - maybe I can.  I now pray that he does try to carry out his plan with his king because I will cross him with ......} Kf7 32. Nf5 {32. Nf5! - this is another forced trade of pieces, one pair of knights is going to come off.  It looks as though I am giving away a free knight but if black takes on f5 then I take on c6.} Nxf5 33. Rxc6 Nxe3 34. Rxa6 {34. Rxa6 - I anticipated Nxe3 because I had Rxa6 up my sleeve.  I think I can get a queenside passer out of this.} Kg6 35. a4 {35. a4 - the pawn trade that will follow will result in my b pawn becoming isolated but passed and with the enemy king on the kingside black may well have to give up his knight for it making me a rook for pawn up.} bxa4 36. Rxa4 Nc4 37. b5 Kf5 {37. ....... Kf5 - my d4 pawn is gonna be a gonner but that will not be a problem.  First I force black to give up that knight.} 38. Ra6 Ke4 39. b6 Nxb6 40. Rxb6 Kxd4 41. Kg1 {41. Kg1 - Henry moves towards the d column to get under the d pawn if necessary.} f5 {41. ...... f5 - black threatens g5 trying to get a passer on the kingside but my next move puts a stop to that idea.  I calculate that I can break up black's kingside pawns next move with Rxg7 and still have time to round up the d pawn.  After 42. Rg6 black waved the white flag!  Thank God I held my nerve.} 42. Rg6 {}
