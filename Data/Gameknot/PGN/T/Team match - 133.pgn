[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {King's pawn game.} 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez.} Nf6 {Berlin Defense of the Ruy Lopez.} 4. Bxc6 {Doubles black's pawns.  I usually go for that.} dxc6 5. Nxe5 {Completely wrong.  Qd4 means white loses either the knight or the pawn.  Ng4 is clearly out, so Nf3 at least prevents QxPe4+ followed by QxPg2 (the poison pawn). } Be6 {While getting the queen out early is generally frowned up, free pawn!  This move is off book.} 6. d3 Bd6 7. O-O {There is no reason to sacrifice the knight.} Bxe5 8. Bg5 {This compounds error, as BxPb2 gives black a rook and pawn (6 points) for a bishop (3 points).} h6 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Nc3 {White recognizes the threat.  Pc3 also works, and might be better.  Black has incentive to trade down while doubling white's pawns.} Be5 11. f4 Bf6 {Here black should consider Bd4+, forcing the white king into the corner.} 12. f5 Bd7 13. Qh5 Qe7 14. a3 O-O-O 15. Qf3 Bg5 16. g3 c5 17. Nd5 Qd6 18. c4 Ba4 19. Rfe1 f6 20. Rab1 Bc6 21. h4 Bd2 22. Re2 Ba5 23. b4 cxb4 24. axb4 Bxb4 {Oops.  NxBb4 gives white a free bishop.} 25. Nxb4 Ba4 {Here Ra3 ends with white taking Pa7.} 26. Ra2 {B-)} Qd4+ {White should interpose the queen, putting even more power on Pa7.} 27. Kg2 b5 {PxPb5, BxPb5, RxPa7.} 28. Nc6 {...or sweet.  White saw a MUCH better move.} Qd6 29. Nxa7+ {Uh, no.  NxRd8.  The rook is worth five, the pawn worth only one.  Granted, RxN puts white up only two, but two is still more than one.} Kd7 30. Nxb5 Bxb5 31. Rxb5 {Here black will wish to protect against Rd5, pinning the black queen.  Pc6 leads to 32. Rb7+, and RxPg7.  Ke7 or maybe Qc6.}
