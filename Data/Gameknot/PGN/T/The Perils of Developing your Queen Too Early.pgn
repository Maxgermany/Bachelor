1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It's not just beginners who develop their queen too early in the opening, I got suckered into commiting that sin by committing another sin called Pawn Grabbing.  You would think I would have learnt from my last game with him wouldn't you.  Well, to be fair to myself, I was not facing a mid-game mating attack here and making it even easier (pardon the pun) for Master Freddy.  Here we are talking about an opening called the Centre Game where the queen does come out early.  I start off with the move 1. e4.} e5 2. d4 {2. d4 - this move characterises the Centre Game.  Black's usual reply is exd4 but Freddy tries an unusual gambit with 2. ......d5.} d5 3. exd5 exd4 4. Qxd4 {4. Qxd4?! - I think this is where I start to go wrong.  This is where I bring out the queen too early in order to try and hold on to the gambit pawn.  It is gonna backfire on me big time because Freddy gains some important tempi that will prove disastrous for yours truly.} Nf6 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3 - now follows some sensible development but little do I know that I have already left it too late.} Nbd7 6. Bc4 {6. Bc4 - developing to defend my d5 pawn at the same time.} Bc5 {6. ....... Bc5 - Glenda is now driven back - she goes to d1.} 7. Qd1 O-O {7. ..... 0-0 - Freddy castles and threatens Re1+.} 8. Bg5 {8. Bg5 - I decide to pin the knight and have decided that if Freddy should give me Re8+ then I would respond with Nge2 blocking the check and I would then play 0-0 next move .....} Re8+ 9. Nge2 Bxf2+ {9. ...... Bxf2+!! - ...... but Freddy has a powerful move which scuppers my plans to castle for good.  I decided to take the bishop.  Freddy said at the time that Kf1 would have been the lesser evil.  I would still be a pawn down and unable to castle but at least I would not be facing an attack quite so soon.} 10. Kxf2 {10. Kxf2?? - see previous note - now I allow a devastating check on g4 which wins back the sacrificed bishop leaving me a pawn down but far far worse facing a powerful mating attack.} Ng4+ 11. Ke1 {11. Ke1 - on second thoughts would Kg1 been an improvement here?} Qxg5 {11. ..... Qxg5 - the Wicked Witch snaps off Fou Lenoir and comes into the attack.  the storm clouds are gathering .......} 12. Bb3 {12. Bb3 - to protect c2 against a knight fork should the black knight come to e3.} Ne3 13. Qc1 Nxg2+ {13. ...... Nxg2+ - now another pawn drops off but worse still Henry is now completely exposed and at Freddy's mercy (now everyone, do you think the word mercy is in Freddy's vocabulary though?  I don't)} 14. Kd1 Ne3+ 15. Ke1 {15. Ke1 - Henry moves back to e1 - g1 is now not an option because the file is completely open to the Wicked Witch.  I know I should have put Henry on g1 but then I would be effectively a whole rook down because of the rook shut in on h1.  Still, I suppose there are other ways to develop a rook.  Henry would have lived a lot longer though.} Ne5 16. Ng3 {16. Ng3 - a feeble attempt to try and block out the Wicked Witch but she moves serenely to f4.} Qf4 17. Ke2 {17. Ke2 - this move allows #2 but Henry is doomed whatever I do.} Bg4+ 18. Kd2 {18. Kd2 - if Ke1 then Ng2 is mate, but now Freddy can also move his knight to g2 delivering a discovered mate.  Aaah, I have just signed up for Fatcat's Four Pawns Attack Mini-tournament and you guys participating in it must be licking your lips because you may have a far easier job to earn yourselves big rating points than you think!} Ng2# {}
