1. e4 {D} d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. h4 Bg7 5. f3 c6 6. Be3 b5 7. g4 b4 {Rather bold, but nothing apparently wrong, will make castling a bit difficult since the king side is destroyed.  Ne2, Nb1, Na4, g5.  Na4 seems a bit clumsy of a placement but there is really nothing to threaten it. It has the advantage of covering c5 square. He will probably try a5.  Ne2 blocked bishop. Nb1, boy do I hate going back to where I was.} 8. Na4 O-O {Okay he castled and did not do a5. But my knight is very awkward and I still need to get my king tucked away. I think I can mount a pretty good king side attack, but that fienchattoed position is tough to attack.  Bc4, b3, Qd2, Be2  Thinking first bishop then Queen. Rejected, don't have a great spot for Bishop yet. But Qd2 allows for the queen to slide along the 2 rank and o-o-o  Threw out Bc4 because of d5. I need to push e5 when he does d5 and I can't if my bishop is being attacked.  b3 seems like a weakness, but if Bd7 happens I have to consider it more because I need running room for the Knight.} 9. Qd2 a5 {okay he did the a5 I was expecting.  So on a high level can I mount a king side attack or should I ooo first. ooo First will put the rook behind my Queen. Neither one of us has great development.  Okay ooo it is. I love king side attacks so this should be fun.} 10. O-O-O Be6 {Attacking my a pawn. Was planning on b3 anyway, gives me an escape route for my knight.} 11. b3 Bd7 {Hmmm I guess his plan will become clear. I guess he wants the Bishop out of the way if he pushes and I push, it is not an evential threat to the knight which is poorly placed anyway. Need to be careful, BxN will destroy Queenside pawns  I think I can ignore this move for now and continue with development, king side attack.  Bc4 helps him open up c file,  h5,  g5 Knight goes to h5 making attack harder sort of like he is in now,  Ne2,  e5 gives him a good hole for his knight,  d5 gives him open c file then Bishop x Knight destroys my queen side,  Nh3} 12. h5 c5 {Nb6 okay why don't i give away all pieces. dxc hxg Looks best can still do dxc later.} 13. hxg6 Bxa4 14. bxa4 cxd4 {14. bxa4 cxd4  15. gxh7+ Nxh7  16. Qh2    Ok gxh7 it is and what can he do Nf6 fllowed by Bxd4} 15. gxh7+ Kh8 {Okay, Bh6 looks good keeps up pressure.} 16. Bh6 Nc6 {17. Bxg7+ Kxg7  18. h8=Q+ Rxh8  19. Qg5+ Kf8  20. Rxh8+   } 17. Bxg7+ Kxg7 {Going according to plan} 18. h8=Q+ Rxh8 19. Qg5+ {Mate cannot be avoided.}
