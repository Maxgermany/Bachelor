1. e4 {Since I was never any good at openings, I started with the most basic move. e4} d5 {Things started to complicate for me, never liked to study or train openings and this one was all new to me. (didn't know about Game DB, call me a Noob. :o )} 2. d4 {I decided to try and conquer the center of the board.} dxe4 3. Nc3 {Developing pieces and aiming to get a pawn back.} Nf6 4. Be3 {Dumb move on my part. Just wasted a move, since I will move the bishop again. I would have been better of with Bc4} e6 5. Bg5 Bb4 6. Qe2 {Another dumb move, I can't explain today.} Qxd4 7. Rd1 {Only logical move at this point.} Qe5 8. Bxf6 {At this point I was hoping that he played Qxf6 so I would do Qxe4, liberating my Bishop and getting a pawn back.} gxf6 9. g3 b6 10. f4 {Another strange move, but I wasn't thinking proper.} Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 Qxc3+ 12. Kf2 {At this point, running away was best, since I couldn't afford to exchange more pieces, given my pawn disadvantage.} f5 {I  believe he would be better off with Rg8. It would apply extra pressure on my already difficult position.} 13. Nh3 Ba6 14. Qd2 {I had no choice at this point, I had to deliver my queen to the exchange.} Qf3+ 15. Kg1 O-O {Protecting from Qd8  } 16. Ng5 {Time to budge that Black Queen away.} Qa3 17. Bxa6 {Clearing some of the pressure on my king.} Nxa6 18. c3 {I stop him from doing Nb4 while protecting my a2 pawn} Nc5 19. Kg2 {Freeing my h1 rook.} Nd3 20. Rhf1 {No idea why I played this, but I was running low on ideas.} Rad8 21. Qe2 {Taking my queen out of harms way.} Kg7 22. Qh5 {Finally a chance to put a bit of pressure of my own.} Qxc3 23. Nxe4 {This seems like a  dumb move, but Qxh7 would only help him develop his rook on the h column. I sacrifice my Knigh, but...} fxe4 24. f5 {Now I'm getting some where. I think...} Nf4+ {He decides to give me my Knight back, can't imagine why.} 25. gxf4 {Only move possible.} Qc2+ 26. Kh1 Rxd1 27. Rxd1 {Some trades.} exf5 28. Qg5+ {Mate in three.} Kh8 29. Qf6+ Kg8 30. Rg1+ Qg2+ 31. Rxg2# {Check Mate. Couldn't believe I had won.}
