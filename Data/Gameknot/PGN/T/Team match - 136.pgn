1. d4 {Maybe one of the strangest games i have ever played.} Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nf3 g6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 Nbd7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O c5 8. d5 Nb6 {until now i had no perspective but defense. Very classical. I was already thinking: this will end in a draw, or I'll make a mistake.} 9. Nd2 {I thought e4 would have come like now.} a6 {preventing Nb5} 10. b3 Bg4 {provoking next move} 11. h3 Bd7 12. Bb2 Qc8 {pointing where I wanted to.} 13. Kh2 Re8 {preparing e5.} 14. Rb1 {preparing a knight move.} Qc7 {protecting d6, because of next move} 15. e4 e5 16. dxe6 e.p. Bxe6 {I preferred to let this e-column opened, as my rook was already there.} 17. Qf3 {pointing various things (f column, b7)} Bd7 {with c6 in view} 18. Ne2 {pointing f6} Nh5 {escaping.} 19. Nf4 {strange and unexpected move, helping my knight.} Nxf4 20. Qxf4 Rad8 {looking for more protection on d6. Who would have guessed d-pawn was up to win the game?} 21. Bxg7 Kxg7 22. Nf3 {clearly pointing to f and h7} Re7 {preparing to move the battle on e-column.} 23. Rbd1 Nc8 {now, d6 is ok for a while.} 24. Rd2 Bc6 {and now b7 is fine.} 25. Nh4 Rde8 26. Re1 b5 {had to open more columns and diagonals} 27. cxb5 Bxb5 28. f3 c4 {this, i was not expecting to keep it for long. though, c-pawn was going to co-win the game. } 29. Rc1 {hmmm! good thinking, of course. White had so many way to keep it high.} Re7e5 {blocking and expecting to protect c4} 30. Qe3 {preparing a f4 advancing.} Rc5 31. b4 {thanks: c4 is now up to advance any time it can.} Rce5 32. f4 {here is the f4 expected higher.} Re5e7 {back after work done on c column.} 33. a3 Kg8 {preparing the attack by avoiding a check on h8 diagonal.} 34. Bf3 {not quite sure this is useful. Will soon be dismissed.} f5 {can't be taken.} 35. Rd4 fxe4 {still can't be taken: if Bxe4, then d5 and bishop falls, whatever is done.  The pawn structure is now the black main advantage. It will be maintained.} 36. Bg2 {dismissed.} Nb6 {preparing a more adventurous d5.} 37. Bf1 {once again, white seems without any solution to attack.} d5 38. f5 {this counter-attack is much more interesting. I think there was the good white idea.} Rg7 {no more work on e-column: let's get back to protection.} 39. fxg6 {not f6, because of Rf7.} hxg6 40. Be2 Qe5 {and this means the pawns are now pushing back the rooks, or the queen has to stay on protection too.} 41. Rdd1 g5 {pushing back the only advanced officer.} 42. Ng2 {now, the knigt is useless. If Q had taken b6, then gxh and the king position is very weak.} Re6 {protecting b6} 43. Rdf1 {is it that white didn't see the pawn structure possibilities?} Rh6 {pushing pression on the king for good. Afterwards, I think I could have gone faster forward with the pawns.} 44. Rf2 d4 {Now it is for good. Even with the rooks on c-d-e-1, I Could have gone forward, but a little bit slower, probably.} 45. Qd2 {no other place. } e3 46. Nxe3 {or loses the rook... My brave e3 soldier falls with honours.} Qxe3 47. Bg4 {I think Qxe3 was more useful, by disconnecting my pawns.} Qxd2 48. Rxd2 d3 {and now? How to stop my pawns? I will pass whatever it takes, as my rooks and my knight will be able to overtake the white rooks structure.} 49. Rf1 c3 50. Rdf2 d2 51. Rf2f8+ {last hope: a trick.} Kh7 52. Bf5+ Rhg6 {but it is solved: of course not R7g6?} 53. Bxg6+ Kxg6 {of course not -again-R7g6} 54. Rf1f6+ Kh7 55. Rd8 c2 56. Rfd6 c1=Q {that's all folks. Thanks to ron for this very strange game.}
