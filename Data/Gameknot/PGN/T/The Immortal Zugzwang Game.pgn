1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 O-O 7. O-O d5 {The blockade, although it doesn't look much like it yet.} 8. Ne5 c6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bf4 a6 {Nimzowitsch pushes for an outpost station at c4.} 11. Rc1 b5 12. Qb3 {Peculiarly, Samisch's move plays straight into Nimzowitsch's hand.  The queen will pave the knight's way after 12. ... Nc6 13. ... Na5 attacking the queen and guiding the queen's knight to the outpost.} Nc6 13. Nxc6 {Samisch sees the combination and trades a well-developed knight to blunt Nimzowitsch's attack.} Bxc6 14. h3 Qd7 15. Kh2 Nh5 {As Nimzowitsch annotated, "I could have supplied him with as yet a second ghost by ...Qe7 and ...Knight-d7-b6-c4, but I wished to turn my attention to the King's side."} 16. Bd2 f5 {! Creating a bind on e4.  Contributes to the overprotection of d5 which will drive the powerful prophylaxis so common in Nimzowitsch's play.} 17. Qd1 b4 {!} 18. Nb1 Bb5 19. Rg1 {? Why not Re1?} Bd6 20. e4 fxe4 {!! After taking the knight, Samisch will have validated almost all the Nimzowitschian principles - the blockade, overprotection and the outpost station we have already seen, and this will invite invasion of the 7th rank and prophylaxis on an impressive scale.} 21. Qxh5 {N.B. it was hard for Samisch to turn down the knight, given 21. Be3 Nxg3 22. fxg3 Bxg3} Rxf2 22. Qg5 Raf8 23. Kh1 Rf8f5 24. Qe3 Bd3 25. Rce1 h6 {Nimzowitsch, again - "A brilliant move, which announces the zugzwang."  Truly, white has no moves left, but the scope is even more impressive than that.  The black queen is not even involved, and no sacrifice on white's part will spare him from the zugzwang, short of that of his queen.  Even his "waiting" pawn moves are in short supply.  Observing 26. g4 Rf3 27. Bxf3 Rh2#, 26. Kh2 R5f3, 26. Bc1 Bxb1 27.Qb3 Qb5 (a new zugzwang), and others, Samisch resigned.}
