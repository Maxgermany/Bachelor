[Opening "Sicilian (B43), Kan, 5.Nc3"]

1. e4 {The e4 open by White, in my mind, is the strongest open. D4 is okay too.  Anything else tells me my opponent needs a lesson in chess. } c5 {I never respond to e4 Ruy Lopez and so I have the French or the Sicilian or the Caro-Kann in my mind as a response.  Rule out the French Defense because the barricades there limit Black to do anything except defend.  Rule in Sicilian or Caro-Kann and then an attack is possible and imminent by Black--and isn't the best defense an Attack? Sometimes I do Sicilian and in this case I do it. } 2. Nf3 e6 {I like the Sicilian Scheveningen variation above the rest. My records in the past when I use Sicilian will show this. } 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Be3 Bb4 8. Qd2 Nxd4 9. Bxd4 f6 10. a3 Bxc3 {I think I made a mistake here in retrospect.  I thought, later, about not trading away the bishop and felt I had better opportunities.  However, hindsight is easier than foresight. } 11. Bxc3 Ne7 {And this is now my problem.  I am essentially behind in development while White has traded with a front I can't attack. I lost the attack here.  "In the fog of war" sort of thing.  } 12. f4 {I'd have done the same if I was White. That King Bishop Pawn in the King's Gambit is crucial to quell Black into absolute submission. } d6 {I gather my Infantry together...} 13. g4 {White sends MORE INFANTRY. Well, I believe in what White is feeling. Advance an Infantry Formation to fix and kill! } e5 {I need to make an advance in the common Infantry Point formation.} 14. f5 {White is locking up Infantry with my Infantry. As well as trying to contain Black. } O-O {Time to castle. } 15. h4 {More infantry from White. He has no problem trying to protect his own King with Castling either side. } d5 {So I advance more infantry...} 16. O-O-O {Now he castles Queen side. I almost think he'd of been better off 0-0 instead. } d4 17. Bb4 a5 18. Bxe7 Qxe7 19. g5 Bd7 20. Rdg1 b5 21. h5 fxg5 22. Rxg5 h6 23. Rg3 Kh8 24. Rhg1 Rf7 25. a4 bxa4 26. Bc4 {I see the weakness again on castling Queen side.  It usually turns out to be a more vulnerable position for the White or Black King to do the Q side castle.  The a1 and b1 squares are open for a prying move to break the box the King is in.  } a3 {If White takes my rook with his bishop then there is nothing to stop the a3 pawn now.  What will White do now?} 27. Bxf7 {Go for material.  } axb2+ {By this time I am feeling pretty good at the sacrifice of a rook.  I have an opening attacking the King that I feel I can sustain. } 28. Kb1 Qxf7 29. Rg3xg7 Qxg7 30. Rxg7 Kxg7 31. f6+ Kxf6 32. Qxh6+ Ke7 33. Qg7+ Kd6 34. h6 Rb8 35. h7 Be6 36. Qf6 Kd7 37. Qg7+ Kd6 38. Qg1 a4 39. h8=Q Rxh8 40. Kxb2 Rh3 41. Qe1 a3+ 42. Ka1 Kc6 43. Qf1 Kb6 44. Kb1 Ka5 45. Qe1+ {We are still at this point even in the material world but working against a Queen with multiple pieces is always a touchy endeavor.  The Queen needs space to maneuver and my pieces need to be where the Queen is limited in movement. I can also use my King to ensure this...} Kb5 46. Qf1+ Ka5 47. Kc1 a2 {The Queen is very limited and it takes work to use multiple pieces to contain her while trying to get ahead of her getting loose...} 48. Kb2 Rh7 49. Ka3 Rb7 50. Qe1+ Ka6 51. Ka4 Rb1 {Risking Qa5+ of course.  I would just back away and Queen eventually however.  White resigns seeing ahead.  }
