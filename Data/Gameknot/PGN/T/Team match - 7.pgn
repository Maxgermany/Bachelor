Bb2 Nc6 {So far by the book} 4. d4 Bb4+ {Black Bishop puts pressure on my king ( not a strong move) because c3 makes black bishop retreat and lose tempo} 5. c3 Ba5 6. d5 {i futher gain momentum by attacking the knight} Ne7 7. Nd2 {development} c5 {black is trying to counteract my control of the center, while giving an escape route for his black bishop} 8. Ngf3 Ng6 {Black Development} 9. Nc4 {Attacking e5 pawn, Developing the strenght of my knights, while sacrificing e4 pawn} Nxe4 10. Qc2 {moving 10. Qc2, im defending c3 pawn from blacks evil intentions, while i cause black knight to retreat and lose additional tempo. } Nf6 11.

All this could have been avoided with intermediate 19.Ng4 move} 22. c4 {If i retreat my rook i'll lose tempos, my attack will be dead, all this offence was for nothing. So, instead i'm opening my black bishop attack on H rook} Nxf5 23. Qxf5 Qg6 {we exchange queens and i see a good end game for myself} 24. Qxg6 hxg6 25.

Bd6+ {making sure the bishop stays hidden for at least few moves} Kg7 {I cant figure out the way to mate with 2 bishops and a knight} 29. Rd3 {so i introduce rook.  My knight will be protected with h or f pawn depending how black kings moves and accordingly my rook will occupy e or h file for future mate.  This were black sees the continuation and resigns  Good Game!}
