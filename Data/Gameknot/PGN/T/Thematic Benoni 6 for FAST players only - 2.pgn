1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Nf3 Bg7 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Nd2 {The old main line benoni, I believe ECO E73.  (Taken from MCO 15)... "The Benoni defense strives for imbalance from the start. Black cedes White more central territory with an advanced pawn on d5 and normally a kingside pawn majority. Black in turn normally gets dark-square play in the center and an extra queenside pawn which can be dangerous if mobilized. } Nbd7 {eyeing e5, black plays on the dark squares in the center. } 11. f3 {I was surprised not to see a4, surpressing black's queenside play, or f4, thrusting into the center. } Ne5 12. Nc4 {12. f4? Neg4 Nc4 challenges the dark squares nicely.  } Nxc4 13. Bxc4 a6 {preparing a pawn thrust on the queenside, trying to make use of the majority.} 14. a4 {stopping the thrust. } Nh5 {Better for me probably would have been Nd7, with the juicy b6 and e5 squares in the knight's sight. I chose h5, however, because of the weak f4 square. } 15. Be3 Be5 {preparing Nf4. } 16. Qe1 Qf6 {black plays harder on the dark squares, and he is already seemingly better because white failed to utilize his center pawns well. } 17. Qd2 Nf4 {black's pieces are invasive and annoying to the white center. } 18. Rab1 {preparing b4, with counterplay. } b6 {aiming to surpress the counterplay } 19. Ne2 Nxe2+ 20. Qxe2 {perhaps Bxe2 was worth a look as well. } Qh4 {a gentle threat. } 21. f4 {I believe g3 may have been the better way to stop Qxh2, as this opens the h5-d1 diagonal for the black bishop. After Bxe2, this wouldn't be a problem...} Bg7 22. Bd3 f5 {opening the E file could prove to be deadly for white. 23. exf4 Bg4 } 23. Qf3 {This fails tactically, as white's position crumbles to dust. } fxe4 24. Bxe4 Bg4 25. Qf2 Qxf2+ 26. Bxf2 Rxe4 {White loses a bishop. } 27. g3 {better was h3 here for white, but he's already a goner, and is playing sloppily until the end. } Rxa4 28. Rfe1 {better was b3. } Bf5 {Seeing he's going to lose yet another pawn, white resigns. }
