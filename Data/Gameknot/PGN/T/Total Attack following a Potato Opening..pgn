1. h3 {It's the Potato opening. Of my invention and I play it against the strong as well. You'll see how it's really amazing : Ok it hands initiative to blacks but what if I tell you that 98 % of blacks response would be non-ideal reply moves ? That is true and that is the philosophy behind this opening. Keep the opponent play for some moves, try to see the weakness in his entry then exploit that. Moreover why take a risky initiative ? Why play with a line that is common to theorists ? } d5 2. a3 e5 {Blacks choices are natural. To my point of view, pushing these pawns will result in big responsability later. Let's see.} 3. e3 g6 {This is a new reply I see from players who confront the Potato opening.} 4. d4 e4 {Did blacks win something here ? If you are a french-defense theorist then you agree with my implicit opinion. Let's continue.} 5. c4 c6 6. cxd5 {This move is obligatory. Bf1 need be released and e2 left for Ng1.} cxd5 {If : 6..Qxd5 7.Nc3 followed by Bc4 and the queen can not prevent it because Qe6 is replied with d5.  Thus whites can get the time to achieve kin-side development.} 7. Nc3 {I should have played Bb5+. Now blacks can play a6 which results in development problems for whites king-side pieces. The only problem of Per-correspondance game is that the train of thought can be lost : we forget the previous calculation and previous plan in the new moves.} Ne7 {Blacks are missing the strong 7..a6 ! The plan is obvious for blacks : develop Bg7 then short castle (queen side is bad for castle).} 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Nge2 {Now look at whites king-side : development was completed only remains the castle. Whites are even able to do it before blacks in spite of the Potato Opening.} a6 10. Ba4 b5 {Blacks are pushing pawns. It is not evident if these moves are strategically good.} 11. Bb3 {Now both Bb3 and Nc3 are attacking d5. Blacks are obliged to do something about it at the expense of building a strong development .} Bc6 {Bc6 is blocking Nc6.} 12. O-O Ra7 {At this moment, I had a some feeling about what was being planned against me : Ra7 looks a strange move, but I found it makes sense if blacks were planning to push f5, prepare pieces formation so to wage an attack on whites king side. ( Be7, Ra=>g7, 0-0,etc). But looking at I noticed that d5 is really posing a problem to blacks. It's difficult to relocate Bc6 or Ne7 without fearing to lose that pawn. Moreover Nf4 was eminent.} 13. f3 {This move does get rid of e4. If blacks pushes f5, and take e4 (after the planned fxe4) with the f5 then they will have to suffer from an open f-rank. Otherwise blacks are going to give me a precious open d-rank in case of dxe4. Consequently I was all expecting exf3.} f5 {Blacks chooses f5 but will take with d5. A bad choice in my point if view.} 14. fxe4 dxe4 15. Nf4 {This came after I abandoned d5 judging it as a little early. If : 15.d5 (threat on c6 and threat Qd4 attacks two rooks) Then 15..Rd7. annihilating dxc and strengthening attack on d5.  So Nf4 was there to gather more attacking pieces.  } Bd7 16. d5 Bg7 17. Bd2 {A development move that helps provide even opportunity for future attack.} Qb6 {Note that blacks can not castle due to the d6+d wins the knight. Note also that g5 that would try to oblige the strongly positioned Nf4 to retreat is bad because of Q+ or even Nh5. By Qb6 blacks are hoping for  18. ...Bxc3 19. bxc3 and the c rank is closed which reduces my attack possibilities (mainly the rook c1). Note that in case of Bx : blacks respond with Qxe3+. This explains my next move.} 18. Kh1 {Now if blacks would like to take the knight then I will simply play Bxc3 which attacks the rook h8 and leaves c-rank open.} Qd6 {Blacks Qb6 could be considered as a succeeding maneuverer : By Qd6 d5 is stopped from further advancement.} 19. Rb1 {Why not Rc1 ? Franckly Rc1 does not gain something in the near future. I hoped to place the Nc3 at d4 and for that b2 need be protected from Bg7.} O-O {Thanks to Qb6, Qd6 blacks managed to castle. Now whites must play it nice. Because at this moment blacks can even hope for an attack plan.} 20. Nce2 Kh8 {Defensive move. The real plan behind Nce2 is Nd4 as I previously said. But this moves also make it possible to threaten Bb4 : the queen has to leave d6 and then d6 wins the rook if the remains on the direction of the bishop b3.} 21. Bb4 Qf6 22. Bc3 {Here I thought that I won the game :  The one who want to understand the notion of tempo in chess then he must see examine the diffrence between 21.Bc3 and 22.Bb4 followed by Bc3. Now the queen has to move. I was planning Bxg7+, followed by Qd4+ takes the rook on a7. } Qb6 {Waw ! I still have to battle.} 23. Nd4 {I gained advancement.} Rc8 24. Qe1 {Here I was in a worry on what move to make with the queen in order to engage the white rooks. Qd2 followed by Rfd1 etc. Finally I played this in order to allow Ne6 by strengthening defense on c3.} a5 {Blacks thought I am threating with Ba5. That was not correct.} 25. Nde6 {Blacks response was wise. He didn't want to lose the bishop g7 in a position were the king is surrounded by whites attackers.} Rxc3 26. bxc3 Bf6 {Preventing the exchange.} 27. c4 {That was when I saw that I can force blacks to open the b-rank since they won't accept to let c4 infiltrate into c5. Opening the rank is good because that way whites can exploit the rook advantage and engage theirs in the battle. Moreover notice that the blacks queen does not have many square to go to. Undermining that side of the board can be of a tactical benefit.} bxc4 28. Bxc4 Qd6 {Do you see the pieces left for the black queen ? only e5 and c7 which are on the same file. That moment I tried to see my possibilities. The position looked promising and there needed be a way how to exploit this before blacks can manage to escape by exchanging pieces.} 29. Qg3 {Exploiting the previous fact about the blacks queen and threatening to takle by the discovered Nxg5 check. } Be8 {Bad move. I was expecting Be5 : 29..Be5 30.Qg5 keeps the pressure.} 30. Nxg6+ {I deplore blacks for the bad moments since the middle game. But same wise, it really took me a great deal of mental energy to keep the attack possibilities in this game.  Hope you enjoyed it.}
