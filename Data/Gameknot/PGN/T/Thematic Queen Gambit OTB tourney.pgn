1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5 {I overlooked quickly before this tourney main ideas of this defence. If he captures on e5, getting a stronghold point on d4 with further natural development to keep it on with Nc6, Qd7, 0-0-0 and maneuver g8 knight until he reaches g6 square and put double pressure on e5 gambited pawn.  If he would play the safely 3.e3, i would respond ...exd4 with a huge attack on his king as b4 is unprotected, e-file with kings exposed and quick development. The d5 square is almost impossible for white to get under control in this line and their remaining d4 will be contested with firepowering pieces as nothing can break knight+ bishop quick development.} 3. dxe5 {The best white move. Release the center pressure is a good + for white.} d4 {d4 is a much stronger square than a dxc4 capture and allows queen exchange, king uncastled and the unleash of light squared white bishop.} 4. Nf3 {Targets d4 and protects e5} Nc6 {Fighting for the center... c5 is also playable but as i planned to 0-0-0, i dont wanna weaken myself.} 5. Bf4 {Here my opponent decided to carry his pawn up as long as he can. 5.g3 and a3 are the most common replies. As white's king is kinda trapped in the center for the moment, 5.g3 is a good way to develop bishop because an e3 move would open d-file which white wanna avoid as black's pieces wanna go there. 5.a3 is also good because it prevents a potentially annoying Bb4+.} Be6 {A playable move which puts pressure on the weak c4-pawn and develops a piece on queenside for a further castling. Most played is 5.Nge7 and fight for the e5 pawn immediately by re-routing next on g6.} 6. Nbd2 {A good answer to a potential Bb4. It develops a piece and is probably best move.} Nge7 {Planning to go on g6 as mentioned before. Qd7 also playable, but i dont wanna show him too early where i'm castling.} 7. a3 {I understand the purpose of not allowing b4, but is this a serious threat? I think this move is too defensive and that g3 could be better.} Ng6 {As planned.} 8. Bg3 {Where else?} Qd7 {Announcing my colors: I wanna 0-0-0 and get control of the d-file.} 9. Rc1 {White's also annoucing their colors: I wanna smash up your 0-0-0 with a pawn storm. Computer recommends 9.h4 instead, allowing white some breathing for their bishop and force black to weaken their kingside with an almost absolute h5 needed. It also gives a support to the important g5 square.} O-O-O {Not scared at all.} 10. b4 Nce7 {Computer here recommends 10.h5. The idea is to make white play first to avoid a bishop trap and use the extra tempo to play next move 11.Nce7. I was more focused on the idea of avoiding a potential white Qa4 and should be cautious about this pawn storm.} 11. h3 {give some space for bishop retreat as potential Nf5 is expected. I think white holds on too much for their bishop and that 11.c5 is better as it gains space and force me to play Kb8 because c6 square i can't allow.} Qc6 {This move stops any pawn advance as it creates weaknesses black could exploit. c5 creates light squared weaknesses for the e6 black bishop and b5 allows strong c5 outpost. Qc6 also guards from a potentiel Ne4 which would be powerful.} 12. Nb3 {I understand the purpose of targeting the d4 pawn, but I think this move weakens the support of their queenside pawn storm, especially the c4 pawn. It also allows a breach on a-file. Computer recommends instead 12.Nh4 to trade off pieces and eliminate an attacker on the e5 pawn. } Nf5 {I sticked to my plan, i thought freeing the dark squared black bishop + getting an outpoust on f5 and protect d4 would be good... but the computer recommends 12.Qa6 12. b5 Qxa3 13. Ra1 Qb4+ 14. Nbd2 Nf5 15. Rxa7 Nxg3 16. fxg3 Bc5 17. Ra8+ Kd7 18. Ra4 Qc3 19. Qb3 Qc1+ 20. Kf2 attacking the a3 and c4-pawn at same time while only one of them would be saved. Although, i didnt liked the idea of opening the a-file for a simple regain of the pawn i gambited. Maybe i should be more gutsy and open it as white's kingside is completely out of play for at least 3 moves (Bh2, g4, Bg2). } 13. Na5 {I dont think this move really helps white as i can eventually kick their knight with b6 and c5. That makes pawns closed and lock up completely their attack on my queenside. } Qe8 14. Bh2 c5 {A total mistake here. I wronfully thought the b6, c5 plan would just be inverted. Let's see next move why.} 15. b5 {And now i'm stucked with a potentially dangerous knight. There's no way to kick him out by b6 as he'll go on c6 and hurts me bad. I think this mistake is the turning point of the game. My opponent pointed it to me with post-analysis.} Qd7 {Keeps an eye of the weak b7 square while fighting for the d-file.} 16. Qa4 Kc7 {Computer better like Qc7 instead. It forces the queen to stay on a4 to guard the a5-knight. Although, my plan was to free the 8th file for rooks and post one on b8 as i expected g4 and Bb2. The discovered check on b6 isnt dangerous as i have at least a rook or bishop to cover up the queen.} 17. Rb1 {Intents are clear.} Rb8 {I really must hold b7 as long as possible even i need to play defensive moves... i have everything to lose by forcing the play and white cant go easily at my king.} 18. g4 {Now white can breathe as they will develop their remaining bishop and short castle.} Nfe7 19. Bg2 Nc8 {Looks odd at first sight, but b6 is a good outpost to kill any counterplay there.} 20. Ng5 {Freeing the diagonal and aims on b7. White will get rid of the good black's bishop.} Nb6 {Now i feel safe on this side of the board. It also puts extra pressure on c4 but its easy for white to meet it.} 21. Qc2 {protects c4 and controls e4 to add extra pressure on a8-h1 diagonal. } Be7 {Another clear mistake. White can really hurt with 22.Nxf7! If bishop recaptures... e6+ and it loses the queen.} 22. Nxe6+ {Hopefully he didnt seen it.} fxe6 {Absolute necessary to keep the e5 pawn locked up.} 23. O-O Kc8 {I was really scared of the potential damage of Qe4.} 24. f4 {Gain space as black's pieces are in a struggle and cant really hurt on d or f-file} Nf8 {Still looks odd, but i dont like Nh4 and f5 is an important threat to meet quickly} 25. Be4 {I expected an immediate c5 and i think it was the right plan. I'll have 1 more move to meet it as best as I can. e4 looks also a better spot for the queen then bishop. But we're already on time pressure both.} g6 26. f5 Bg5 {The opening of the f-file is the less of my concerns. Potential f6 move gains space but allows me to remove my pieces to protect the last entry: the a8-h1 diagonal. Bg5 can have potential threats of his own on e3 so its a more active pieces. Don't forget that e5 pawn must be blockaded at any cost.} 27. fxe6 Qxe6 {Time pressure mistake. Nxe6 is far better for a blockade and guards f8 square for a potential double rook attack from white on f-file.} 28. Rf3 {Doubling rooks.} Nfd7 {Protection of the f8 square is the most important. Not the e5 pawn even it looks like that.} 29. Rbf1 {Rest of the game was played without writing the moves as we didnt had enough time. I won on time after he made nice sacrifice combination to free up the e6 pawn, captured the b7 pawn, bring my king into the g7 square, made a 2nd queen which was traded off by pieces. I had rook+ knight + pawns vs queen + pawns.  I wanna show this game to maybe increase the popularity of this underground line against queen gambit. It's interesting as a surprise weapon and lot of imbalances in the play makes it real fun to play even several mistakes were done in this game.}
