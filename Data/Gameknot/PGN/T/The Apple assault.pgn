1. d4 Nf6 {I decided to move my horse because it moves in an L shape and that is pretty cool.} 2. Bg5 {I haven't ever seen anyone do this before.} e6 {But it's all coo' because my queen now has visual contact with the steed of awesomeness.} 3. e4 {I see your game, you devious rogue you!} Be7 {That pin isn't cool yo. Not going to lose my Noble steed of awesomeness to some pawn like that.} 4. e5 {Still going to advance. Long hair, don't care} Nd5 {Dun want my horsy to get taken.} 5. Bd2 {That dude with the cross on his head ran away. Probably because my army is so intimidating and what not.} d6 {Quit cramping me yo, i need some room to breathe.} 6. c3 {Waste of a tempo and removes a good square for one of his horsy.} dxe5 {HIYAHHHHH! And with the swiftness of a thousand lambs my pawn strikes!} 7. dxe5 {I drew first blood, so its all good.} Nc6 {Now i have 2 horsy's running around. I wish i had an apple to feed them.} 8. Nf3 {One of his horsy's come to protect the evil foot soldier dude that is in my space.} O-O {My king decides it is time to chill in his awesome castle. It has a pool table.} 9. Bb5 {That other dude with the cross on his head came out. Long hair, she don't care.} Bd7 {So i figure i will bring my other dude with the cross on his head. His name is Fredrick the 3rd and 1/2.} 10. Bxc6 {NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MY HORSEY! } Bxc6 {VENGEANCE! dang poachers are stealing my steeds. Luckily Fredrick the 3rd and 1/2 was there to rectify the situation and maintain order.} 11. O-O {He goes into his castle. It probably doesn't have a pool table though.} Nb6 {My horsey made another L. It was pretty cool.} 12. Qc2 {The evil succubus is on the move! You shan't have my king succubus!} Bxf3 {I decide to exchange my crossheaded dude for one of his horsey's, thus piercing his castle!} 13. gxf3 {Now that i see inside his castle, i am certain there is no pool table.} Nc4 {My horsey threatens his cross headed guy.} 14. Bf4 {But his cross headed guy runs away... again. What a pansy.} Bg5 {However, my cross headed guy is not a pansy, and looks to do battle.} 15. Bg3 {And his cross headed guy runs away again! pansy...} Bh4 {My guy will not be denied!} 16. b3 {meh...} Bxg3 {Hiyahhhh! and the cowardly cross headed dude is slain. } 17. hxg3 {and now no crosses remain. And his castle still has a hole in it... Whats up with that?} Nxe5 {Yo... my horsey just ate a man. that is what happens when you don't feed them apples.} 18. Nd2 {His horsey finally enters into the field. About time you lazy horse. Maybe he had too many apples?} Qf6 {And my noble lady leaps into the field!} 19. f4 {meh...} Ng4 {Your castle is all but destroyed! your walls are crumbling and my army approaches!} 20. Nf3 {His horsey comes to the defense...} e5 {But my minions know no fear! and i'm pretty sure there are apples on the other side of the board.} 21. Kg2 {meh...} exf4 {Invading the castle for all the apples and other assorted fruits for my horsey.} 22. gxf4 {meh...} Qxf4 {Your castle is all but destroyed, your apples will soon belong to me!} 23. Rfh1 {A pathetic attempt to raid my castle! The pool table shall remain in my possession.} h6 {Your feeble assault has been repelled! My bulwark of fortitude is unrivaled!} 24. Rh4 {I'm not worried. Your apples will soon belong to me.} g5 {And my castle suddenly grows feet and charges into the fray! Soon i shall send everything at your crumbling structure. Except for the pool table of course... That stays with me.} 25. Nxg5 {A last ditch effort to create an opening for my pool table.} Qxg5 {However your assault is easily repelled once more.} 26. Rh3 {Retreat you little pansy! Your apples will soon belong to me.} Ne3+ {And my noble steed makes his move on the evil succubus, whilst my noble lady discovers the king and his apples.} 27. Kf3 {The castle has been fully vacated, and the apples are ripe for the taking!} Nxc2 {But first the steed defeats the evil succubus in battle.} 28. Rg3 {Hmm... the noble lady is put in a predicament. However, the battle is all but over, and the apples will soon be mine.} Qxg3+ {And this is where my opponent cancels the game? He didn't leave, he didn't resign, but cancelled on the count of a move taking too long? Personally i'm a bit upset with that as i didn't think any of my moves were particularly long, however i have an apple, so i'm still calling it a victory and dominant performance. My pool table was not even threatened in the process either.}
