[Opening "Caro-Kann (B11), two knights, 3...Bg4"]

1. e4 c6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 {This is a line I saw analysed by a GM once. It is a positional trap, because the temptation is to play  3...d4?! 4 ne2 (threatening d4) and now 4...d3 5. ng3 is great for white (he has the strong knight on g3 but still has his key e4 pawn, whereas black has the awkward pawn on c6) or worse still 4...c5 5. c3 and black won't be able to hold on to those central pawns because of the Qa4+ check. Either way white gets a strong centre and easier development. The correct move for white is either dxe4, which leads to normal Caro-Kann stuff, or the game continuation which is more interesting!} Bg4 {Now the plan for white is to keep the light-squared bishop from the queenside and create some weaknesses there. Not really what happens in the game, but still...} 4. h3 Bh5 5. g4 Bg6 6. exd5 cxd5 7. d4 {I wasn't sure about this move. I have played 7. Bb5+ before in an OTB game, but after 7...nc6 8. ne5 rc8 I was unclear of how to exploit black's development problems. I played this against a WIM in a tournament once, and eventually got beaten with a tactic. I tried 7. d4 this time as Be4 is no real threat and maybe I can be more flexible in responding to black's attempts to develop. I was expecting something like 7...h5 or 7...nf6 here, because black's main problem is developing the kingside. I can't see any major problems with the game continuation, but it did allow me some weaknesses to work with.} Nc6 8. Bb5 {Following my opening play, this is the only consistent way to proceed. I want to isolate a pawn on c6 if possible and dominate the game with ne5.} a6 9. Bxc6+ bxc6 10. Ne5 {As planned. Now it's harder than it looks to defend c6. There are ideas like qf3 floating about, whereupon I can think about the sacrifice on c6 or the pawn storm starting with h4. } Qc8 {I've requested computer analysis, but I would bet that this is a mistake. It gives me a tempo after na4. It serves a nice purpose of defending c6 while attacking a key diagonal (if ...h5 at some point, I have to be careful), and it avoids the danger of Bf4 for the moment. In fact, it demonstrates how c6 is more difficult to defend than would first appear.} 11. Na4 {This move is justified, I think, even if it is unrealistic to expect to have the knights on e5 and c5 for long enough to do damage. The tempo I gain with the threat of nb6 is good and there aren't many safe squares for those major pieces. Still, black hasn't got his kingside developed at all...good news for me.} Rb8 12. Bf4 {12. nc5 was also a contender, of course. I thought the best response would be e6, whereupon I have a number of options. I considered  ncd7, rook somewhere, then nxf8 to take away black's castling rights...but decided that black might be safer with the king in the centre (I have no pawn break really, whereas he has h5 to release his rook). I wasn't sure how best to exploit the positional advantage I have, so decided upon Bf5. It makes the rook uncomfortable (although I'm not sure whether it's forced to move immediately or not), develops an important piece while b2 is still protected and gives me another defender on the kingside, which could open up at any time with h5.} Rb4 {This must be a mistake. It allows the very natural move c3 for me, which solidifies my centre, protects the knight and makes the rook move (again).} 13. c3 {Of course. There was never any other contender to this all purpose move.} Rb5 14. Qe2 {I first noted that the rook has very few safe squares. I considered the sequence 14. b4 followed by nc5 and a4 to get things rolling. I think it would have been ok, but I would constantly have to calculate what happens after ...h5, to see whether I would have to spend time defending myself. My concern was that black would develop (kicking my knight out first) and then have rook and queen on an open file (after a5), which would force me to castle short and then h5 would be strong. I decided to wait with qe2, which protects b2 (allowing the knight to move) and discourages any weakening of the central pawns. With the king so tied up in the centre there may be some sacrificial opportunities. Note that in the absence of the queen, the back rank mate is possible in some (rather weird) lines.} e6 {This had to come, I suppose. It helps black develop but also weakens his counterplay against the g4 square, and makes my game considerably more solid.} 15. h4 {So I jumped on the opportunity to try to embarass the black king. Of course if 15...h6 then Bxg6 fxg6 and black has a long-term weakness in front of an uncastled king. It should be a quick game after that. I don't know what the computer says (yet) but f6 is probably a necessary move.} f6 {I thought about this for quite a while. I figured that if Nf3 then Be4 and I will have to defend for a while with one knight out of the game. If nd3 then Bxd3 and I still have a good game, but again I'll spend time getting the other knight back in the game and black's kingside is relatively unharmed. The game continuation gives me a few weaknesses to work with, and so I calculated both pawn advances and noticed that there was an interesting positional way to play against the B on f8.} 16. Nxg6 hxg6 17. g5 {This was the point. After fxg5 Bxg5 Be7 I can play Bxe7 and then after nxe7 my knight comes to c5 and will be unstoppable. The e5 pawn will have to fall. If kxe7 instead, I castle and nc5 is just as good.} Be7 18. O-O-O {Same idea as expressed in the last note. Black needs his dark-squared bishop for the g5 area and for the knight if it comes to c5.} Kf7 {This is one of those moves that rings alarm bells. My first instinct was rde1 and then try to distract the queen from e5. But how? Then I noticed a way to build the pressure on g6 instead, as a way of breaking through.} 19. h5 {I like this move! Again, no computer analysis yet, but I calculated a few possibilities: 19...fxg5? hxg6+ and the rook falls. 19...gxh5 20. rxh5 rxh5 (forced) 21. qxh5+ and then ...g6 22. qh7+  kf8 leads to a strong position. I think I can probably win by bringing the knight in with 23. nc5 If he takes it with the bishop, then Bd6 will be too strong a weakness. I can also bring the rook to the h-file and up to h7 in true Fischer style! Note that Qb7 is never enough of a threat for him as I have b3 to hold the attack off for a while. 19...gxh5 20. rxh5 rxh5 21. qxh5+ kf8 and I'm doing very well indeed. I don't know how best to continue (probably g6) but there are lots of mating ideas in this and it's hard to bring the pieces back to the defense of the kingside quickly. I didn't calculate this to the end, by any means, but I was confident that either continuation was favourable to white.} gxh5 20. Rxh5 {Here black resigns. He may have calculated further than I did, and seen that it was hopeless. I would have carried on for a while, but then being in the driving seat I wasn't forced to calculate all the possible defensive lines. I will wait until the computer analysis arrives before deciding whether the resignation was premature or not. Anyway, a nice game I think...hope you do too.}
