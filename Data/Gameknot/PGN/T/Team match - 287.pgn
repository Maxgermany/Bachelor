1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bd3 {Not a great move, It blocks in the QP and doesn't have many squares to go to.} Nf6 4. O-O Bc5 5. c4 {Taking some more control of the center} d6 {Now I'm ready to develop my LSB} 6. Nc3 Bg4 7. h3 Bxf3 8. gxf3 {This is another not-so-great move as it blows open the kingside cover. This move is part of the reason I was able to get mate.} O-O {I castle} 9. a4 {I don't know what this move is supposed to do} Qd7 {Threatening a pawn} 10. Nd5 Qe6 {?? This is probably one of the worst moves I could have played. This not only undefends my pawn, but turns it into a fork if he captures it. } 11. Nxc7 {Which he does} Qd7 {Better would have been taking his pawn} 12. Nxa8 Rxa8 13. a5 a6 14. Qb3 Rd8 15. Ra4 h6 16. Qc3 Qxh3 {Finally I take it} 17. Re1 Qh4 {Threatens a fork} 18. Kf1 {?? Turns the fork into mate} Qxf2# {And I find it. }
