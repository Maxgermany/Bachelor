1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Nimzo-Indian. highly popular in the last decade.} 4. e3 {more popular are Qc2, g3, Nf3.} Bxc3+ {I don't know if it is theory or not but I wouldn't exchange the bishop for the Knight just yet. I think I would play in this situation c5 or d5 to keep the tension in the center.} 5. bxc3 d5 6. Nf3 {white can take once on d5 and then play c4 again...} Nc6 7. Ba3 {preventing 0-0 from black.} Bd7 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. c4 {white has a great center.} Nb6 10. Be2 Na5 {there is no realy attack on c4. Rc1 would solve all of white problems.} 11. Qc2 Qf6 {Ba4 is worth looking.} 12. O-O Nc6 13. Rab1 Rb8 {black cant castle on the king side and now he cant casyle on the queen side. the black king stays in the center, which means trouble.} 14. Bd3 Ne7 15. Ne5 {white has a lot of space to manouver his pieces. it seems that white has a great chance by attacking.} Ba4 16. Qc3 O-O {finally.} 17. Rxb6 {! two pieces for the rook. a good deal!} cxb6 18. Qb4 Nc6 19. Qxa4 Rfd8 {19... Nxe5? 20. dxe5 Qxe5 21. Bxf8  -} 20. Nxc6 bxc6 21. Qxc6 {white has taken over the board!} a6 22. Bd6 Rdc8 {? the next move shows the reason.} 23. Qe4 {!} g6 24. Bxb8 Rxb8 25. Rc1 {great advantage for white.} Qe7 26. c5 bxc5 27. Rxc5 f5 28. Qe5 Re8 29. Rc7 Qf8 30. Bc4 {the mate is near...}
