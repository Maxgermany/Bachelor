[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 e5 2. c4 {Taking space in the center, but has the inconvenient of weakening the the black spaces in the center (d4 e5).} Nc6 {Normal developpement} 3. Nc3 Bc5 4. Nf3 d6 5. Nd5 {This has to be considered as a mistake, moving a piece twice in the opening without a good reason.} Nf6 6. d3 O-O 7. a3 Bg4 8. Be2 Nxd5 9. exd5 Nd4 {Nd4? I thought about a series of exchanges 10. Nxf3  Bxe2 but did not see 11. Nxe2... } 10. Nxd4 Bxe2 11. Nxe2 {I'm one piece behind... At this moment I told myself : "OK, you made a mistake, just focus back on the game now". I decided to take some expansion on the king side, where he will most likely castle.} Qf6 {Threatening Qxf2 } 12. O-O {Now, the F pawn is pinned to his king by my bishop.} Rae8 {I'm now planning to push my e pawn and eventually move my queen and advance my f pawn.} 13. Ng3 Bd4 {Pinning his b pawn to his rook and keeping his bishop in c8 to defend his weak pawn.} 14. Nh5 Qg6 {Now I can push my f pawn forward. I don't know what white was trying to do with that move. It just allowed me to go forward with my plan.} 15. Qf3 f5 16. Ng3 e4 17. dxe4 {I think Qd1 was better} fxe4 {Threatening his queen...} 18. Qh5 Qf6 {Avoiding the exchange and putting even more pressure on f2.} 19. Rb1 {Finally freeing his bishop} Bxf2+ {Getting some material back but pinning my bishop to my queen. Still, white needs to move his king and it allows me...} 20. Kh1 Re5 {1. To drive his queen back and...} 21. Qe2 e3 {2. To lock my bishop in f2.} 22. b4 {He is now planning Bb2 to attack both my rook and my queen on the a1-h8 diagonal.} Qh6 {Countering his next move and threatening his knight, h pawn is now pinned to his King} 23. Qg4 {Protecting the knight and planning Qh3 to try to exchange the queens.} Rf4 24. Qc8+ {Only decent move still...} Kf7 25. Qxc7+ Re7 26. Qc8 {the queen is now out of his defense! and I can now press my attack harder.} Bxg3 {Taking the undefended knight...} 27. Rxf4+ Bxf4 {and I am now threatening Qxh2  . He has now 4 options 25. h3, 25. g3, 25. Qh3 and 25. Qf5 , which he does.} 28. Qf5+ Qf6 {Now that I have the positional advantage and that I have been able to get back even on the material front, the exchange of the queens is at my advantage (plus it is the only move that defends my bishop). The e pawn should be enough to give me the win.} 29. Qh5+ Kg8 {Now he has to be wary. If i move my bishop I can now checkmate with Qf1.} 30. Qe2 {Nice move by white, blocking the pawn in e3. My next move would have been e2.} Qh4 31. g3 {g3 was the best move he could do. He sacrifices the pawn to get a little defense. After 31. ... Bxg3, white can't grab the e pawn with 32. Bxe3 because of 32. ... Rxe3 and the queen can't grab the rook because of the mate by the queen in h2. The queen needs to always keep an eye on h2.} Bxg3 32. Rb3 {Rb3???? This move loses the game. He tries to overload my defense on the e pawn but...} Bf2 {I simply protect it with my bishop, threatening Qe4  and the checkmate is close. White needs to place his queen in f1 in order to protect from the checkmate but white does not see the threat...} 33. Bxe3 {Precipitating his demise. Mate in two now...} Qe4+ {He resigns, realizing the checkmate follows after 34. Qf3 Qxf3#. Still I think white's best defense was 33. Qf1 but after that I would simply played Re5 and Rh5 on order to submerge his tenuous defense.  I am really proud of this game. I usually continue to play bad after an early blunder, but in this game I have been able to fight back and win. Hope you like it. Feedback is appreciated.}
