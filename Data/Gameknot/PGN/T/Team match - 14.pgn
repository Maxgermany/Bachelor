1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 e6 3. Nf3 a6 4. c3 d5 5. exd5 exd5 6. Bb3 Nc6 7. O-O Be7 8. Re1 Nf6 9. h3 O-O 10. a4 h6 11. Bc2 b5 {I have reviewed the computer analysis of this game and here is where it points to my first mistake. I should have moved d4 due to center control. This move instead allowed white to dominate the a file and, as you'll see, I pay for this move later on.} 12. axb5 Na7 13. bxa6 Nc6 14. d4 c4 {Here I missed a chance to get 6 for 5 with Rxa6. Looking back, of course I wish I had done that. That really would have given me a better chance further into the game, but here we are reviewing my mistakes instead. Two pawns down to a much higher rated player is not an enviable position.} 15. Nbd2 Bxa6 16. Nf1 Re8 17. Ne5 Qd6 {This one stumps me a little. The computer wanted Nxe5 as the optimal move, but from what I can see it's just... still bad, but not quite as bad? I guess that makes sense, but the nuance of that kind of position is clearly not my strongest point. The analysis goes on for 16 moves in this line for a slightly less bad position for black, leading me to believe that the chess engine is far, far more advanced than any human likely has need for, now or in the near future.} 18. f4 {A series of mistakes on both sides follows that doesn't materially effect my play/position because I make a lot of them...  Also, I've experienced this before, but sometimes I get a kind of 'mistake blindness' where I just don't see the errors a higher rated players makes while I'm in the game. Things that look obvious after the fact are obscured by rating difference somehow.} h5 19. Ng3 Ne4 20. Nf5 Qf6 21. Nxe7+ Rxe7 22. Bxe4 dxe4 23. Rxe4 Bb7 24. Rxa8+ Bxa8 25. Re1 Nxe5 26. Rxe5 Rxe5 27. dxe5 Qg6 {This one I understand. Qc6 was the better position due to lining up the Queen and bishop and then being able to effectively press white's positions. Missed my last and best opportunity to really make up some material in this one.} 28. Qd8+ Kh7 29. Qxa8 Qb1 30. Kh2 Qxc1 31. Qe4+ g6 32. Qxc4 Qxb2 {It says I blundered here and gave Coldbrew mate in 14 moves. I'm not sure I've ever played anyone who can string a game out 14 moves to mate from this position... The rest of this game is what the engine classifies as a series of blunders on both sides, but I'm not sure any commentary matters much past move 37 or so since I think the best it said I could expect was to be at -60 and surrounded by white's pawns. I resigned at 42 because I just didn't see how it was possible to stop all of his pawns, so drawing it out seemed unsportsmanlike. I congratulate my opponent and appreciate his and his team captain's willingness to match me up with a much higher rated player.} 33. Qxf7+ Kh6 34. e6 Qxc3 35. e7 h4 36. Qxg6+ Kxg6 37. e8=Q+ Kh6 38. Qe6+ Kg7 39. Qg4+ Kf6 40. Qxh4+ Kf5 41. Qg4+ Ke4 42. f5+ {}
