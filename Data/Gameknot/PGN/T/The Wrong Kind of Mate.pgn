1. d4 {Hi everyone!  Ardin kindly put this game into the It Can Be Done thread many moons ago.  Although this isn't an Expert draw, it is a Near-Expert Draw and there is a 500 point rating differential between the two sides.  It looked as though Ardin's opponent was gonna cop Old Matey.  In fact the black king was in Old Matey's shadow, but a stunning sacrifice of the black queen ensured that Ardin delivered the wrong kind of mate.  So how did this happen?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13171068&rnd=0.9733391231055444} e6 2. e4 {2. e4.  This looks like a French Defense by transposition.  Ardin strikes at the centre straight away.  Can he keep black pegged back though?  Only time will tell.} d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {3. ..... Bb4 - indeed, the Winawer.} 4. Bd3 c5 5. dxc5 dxe4 6. Bxe4 Qxd1+ 7. Kxd1 {7. Kxd1 - after a little stouche in the centre the queens are exchanged and white will lose his extra pawn.  White has a slight lead in development however, could this be decisive?} Nf6 8. Bd3 Bxc5 9. Nh3 O-O 10. Bg5 {10. Bg5 - Ardin clears the decks.  He also threatens Bxf6 busting up black's pawn structure.} Nc6 11. Bxf6 gxf6 {11. ..... gxf6 - and he does!} 12. Ne4 Be7 13. g4 e5 14. Rg1 {14. Rg1 - aha, lining up a WR against the BK, not a bad idea!} Rd8 15. Ke2 {15. Ke2 - connecting the rooks.} Be6 16. f4 Rac8 {16. ..... Rac8 - if exf4 then Nxf4 and black will have very weak kingside pawns in the coming endgame.} 17. c3 Kh8 18. f5 {18. f5 - fixing that pawn structure on the kingside.} Bd5 19. b3 Na5 20. c4 Bc6 {20. ..... Bc6 - it's this square or leave the board for the knight on e4.  The black lsb decided to stay on the board and retreat to c6.} 21. Nhf2 Rc7 22. g5 fxg5 23. f6 Bxe4 24. Nxe4 {24. Nxe4 - now the exchange takes place but another white knight hops on to e4 and the g5 pawn is under the hammer.} Bb4 25. Rxg5 Rcd7 26. Rd1 {26. Rd1 - the white lsb must be defended because if he moves away then King Ardin will come under the hammer through Rd2+.} Nc6 27. Rh5 {27. Rh5 - threatening Rg1.  That will take place if Ardin can back up his lsb.} Bf8 28. Nd6 {28. Nd6 - this leaves Ardin's knight en prise, Checkmate is tempted to swipe it but suddenly he starts to shiver,  there is a dark, dark shadow all of a sudden and the air is absolutely foul in front of the black king.  It is that chessic Grim Reaper, Old Matey, and his scythe is about to descend on h7 (Rh7#).  Checkmate sees the mate, however and defends with h6.} h6 29. c5 Nd4+ 30. Ke3 b6 {30. ...... b6 - undermining the support of Ardin's knight on d6.} 31. b4 a5 32. a3 {32. a3 - but Ardin finds valuable support.} a4 33. h4 bxc5 34. bxc5 Rb8 {34. ...... Rb8 - threatening Rb3.} 35. Bc4 {35. Bc4 - defending against the threat and issuing one of his own, Nxf7+ which will either win the exchange or win more if the BK goes to either g8 or h7.} Kh7 36. Rg1 Ne6 37. Bxe6 fxe6 38. Rxe5 {38. Rxe5 - Ardin finally wins material.} Rb3+ 39. Ke4 Rxa3 40. Rxe6 Ra2 41. Kd5 Rc2 42. Kc6 Ra7 {42. ..... Ra7 - but black has a supported pawn on the a column and that pawn will eventually rob Ardin of a thoroughly deserved near-Expert Victory.} 43. Kb6 Rd7 44. Rge1 Kg6 45. f7+ {45. f7+ - this discovered check looks really nasty.} Kh7 46. Rf1 a3 47. Re8 Rxd6+ 48. cxd6 Bxd6 {48. ..... Bxd6 - an interesting exchange sac by black who wants to ensure that the a pawn crowns.} 49. h5 Rh2 50. Kc6 Bb4 51. Rf4 a2 52. Rxb4 {52. Rxb4?? - sadly this is the move which costs Ardin the win.  If you look at Gameknot Analysis you will see how Ardin could have converted his victory.} a1=Q 53. f8=Q {53. f8/Q - both the a and f pawns crown but it is the pawn that crowns first that can do a hell of a lot of damage, unless the pawn that crowns second crowns with check.  If that is not the case then he who crowns first lands the first check which could be at best annoying, at worst, tragic.} Qa6+ 54. Kd7 Rd2+ 55. Kc7 Rc2+ 56. Kb8 Rc8+ 57. Rxc8 {57. Rxc8 (forced)} Qa7+ {57. ..... Qa7 CH-EEE-CK!!!!  A brilliant move.} 58. Kxa7 {58. Kxa7 STALEMATE.  White had no choice.  Incredibly the WK had only one legal move and that was to take the BQ.  A mere 19 points up, Ardin had to contend himself with a near-Expert Draw.  Ardin played really well, he kept his Class A opponent on the back foot for a lot of the game and attempted to go for the jugular and only very late on did black attempt any counterplay - white simply did not allow any until that unfortunate capture.  Ardin's king was then exposed to a series of checks from the BQ and BR until his opponent forced that stalemate.  Well played Ardin and keep it up!  Joanne}
