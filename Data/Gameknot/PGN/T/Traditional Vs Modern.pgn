1. e3 e5 2. d3 d5 {He's letting me gain centre control maybe to launch a side attack later } 3. Ne2 {He opts for Ne2 rather than Nf3... } Nf6 {I continue } 4. h3 {Doesnt want me pinning his Knight } Nc6 5. a3 Bd6 {Backing up the centre pawns } 6. g3 {Unusual fiancetto coming up?  I'd never encountered this type before except in our previous game (this was a rematch where I won the first).} Be6 {I don't always play like this but it seemed appropriate } 7. Bg2 {There's the fiancetto...Has anyone else seen this played?} O-O {Castling early } 8. Nd2 {I was enjoying this game } a5 {Getting the pawns out } 9. b3 {Getting ready for Fiancetto 2.0 .. ;)} Ne7 {That moment where there's nowhere else to go cuz all the pieces have been developed..} 10. Bb2 {He is all for symmetry..} c5 {The purpose of me pulling back the Knight } 11. O-O {He chooses to castle } Qc8 {Time to reinforce + launch an attack K-side} 12. Kh2 {He notices...} h5 {I haven't finished yet! Compromising my own k- side for a good offense } 13. f4 {He fights back but im not sure about this move being a good idea ..} Nc6 {Returns to defending position to protect e pawn } 14. e4 {Now he wants my centre position! } d4 {His dark square bishop can't really do anything useful now and I conveniently get out of a pawn exchange } 15. f5 {Blocking k-side entry and attacking my bish } Bd7 {Only safe place for the bishop } 16. Ng1 {Hmmmm... I would have placed Knight at c4 attacking other bishop} b5 {I block that path } 17. Bf3 {Trying to attack the lone h pawn } g6 {Defending the lone h pawn} 18. Bc1 {Why..?} Kg7 {New plan!!} 19. Kg2 Rh8 {H file attack!!} 20. fxg6 {This works for me as now his h pawn is vulnerable ...} fxg6 21. Nb1 {He is preparing to add the dsb to the greenzone } Be7 {Im aware of this } 22. Bg5 Nd8 {Adding the Knight to the fire soon } 23. Qe2 Nf7 {To get rid of the dsb } 24. Bxf6+ {He chooses to capture rather than retreat } Bxf6 {I reciprocate} 25. Qf2 {He intends to make use of the f file} Ra6 {My rook is ready to come into play } 26. Bxh5 {?? Bad idea...} Rxh5 {Its interesting that my attack on his k-side has left my own k-side quite skeletal } 27. g4 {He realised his h pawn was again vulnerable } Rh7 {The best move as ...Rh6? would lead to g5 and then he would get my Knight and get into my kings territory . Not going to happen!} 28. Qg3 {Not good -what about strong f file?} Bg5 {Preventing g5. Safe as f file is not under pressure anymore } 29. Nf3 {Another minor attack } Bf4 {Touch√©!} 30. Qe1 {He would have benefitted more from Qf2, IMO ..} Qh8 {At last!! My plan commences..} 31. Rh1 {Defending} g5 {No turning back for the bish! Opening up the 6th rank} 32. Nbd2 {Doesnt see the danger?} Rah6 {Despite my king being out in the open he has no real counterattack and now I've got a heavily armed h file } 33. Qg1 {Don't know why he does this } Rh6xh3 {Tearing down those walls!} 34. Rxh3 Rxh3 {Nice!} 35. Rf1 {Uh oh!} Rg3+ {The king must step aside from his lady!} 36. Kf2 Rxg1 {If he takes with the Knight he loses the other Knight but it is better than taking with the rook...} 37. Rxg1 {Mistake because...} Be3+ {37...Be3!! At this point he resigns as he will lose his rook and I will have the advantage to compose a quick win. Hope you enjoyed the annotation! :D}
