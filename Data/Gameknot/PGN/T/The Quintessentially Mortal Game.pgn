1. e4 Nf6 {I have played thousands of games of chess, but every once in a while a game comes along that really teaches you about so much more than just this simplistically complex game we all love so much-- call it "life imitates chess", if you will, although the myriad wizardry & poetic musings lofted upon this, the "Quintessentially Mortal Game", do NOT do it justice...The unbridled enthusiasm with which Black develops and unleashes his unrivaled strategic genius upon a shocked and helpless White is only surpassed by Black's sheer resolve to win, in this come-from-ahead masterpiece...Enjoy!} 2. e5 d5 {White immediately attempts to control the center with his e pawn, but black is up to the challenge. The f6N and the d5 pawn are combining to comfortably control the white squares in the center of the board. } 3. exf6 gxf6 {Black concedes a few points in material for the sake of controlling the center with his middle pawns. While a double pawn on the f file may seem troublesome, recall that Bobby Fischer once remarked that double pawns in the center of the board can be surprisingly effective. } 4. Qe2 Bg4 {Notice how White uses the tempo gained from Black doubling up his f pawns to establish position on the half opened e file. Black challenges this position by threatening White's queen. It is always a good idea to force your opponent to move the same piece multiple times in the opening, and as we can see Black already has White's Queen on the run...} 5. Qa6 e5 {White's queen escapes from the bishop threat, and Black uses the tempo gained to strengthen his stranglehold on the center of the board. } 6. Qxf6 Be7 {Note how the Be7 move removes the option of White trading Queens. In the early part of a game it is generally unwise to trade Queens unless it is to gain a legitimate material advantage. } 7. Bb5+ Nd7 {Some checks are scarier than others. This check by white is really putting pressure on the center pawns, as the bishop pin leaves the e5 pawn unguarded...} 8. Qxe5 O-O {White is happy to take the center pawn gift, while Black is happy to castle his King into safety. Garry Kasparov noted that losing a pawn in material for the sake of King safety can oftentimes be the difference between forcing a draw or even winning a game from a lost position, as opposed to being checkmated very quickly. } 9. Bc6 Re8 {White attacks the vulnerable b7 pawn, but Black counters with Re8 which threatens a discovered attack skewering of White's queen...Black is slowly uncoiling like a snake, preparing to strike...} 10. Qg3 b5 {White moves his queen to safety, Black moves b pawn to safety. } 11. Ne2 Ne5 {Oftentimes in the middle game you will see a series of knight moves as both sides attempt to find a knight outpost. Both sides are pursuing this goal masterfully!} 12. Bxa8 Ba3 {White swipes the unprotected Black rook, but this material gain is not without consequence, because now black has several tactics at his disposal, in addition to placing the b2 pawn under heavy attack. } 13. Bxd5 Nd3+ {White greedily takes black's center pawn, only to fall into a vicious trap by black...The e5N moves to d3, Forking the King and the black bishop on c1 -- simultaneously, the rook on e8 is pinning white's e2N...Its a Pin and Fork sandwiched together --- its a "Pulled Pork Sandwich"!} 14. Kd1 Qg5 {White moves his King to safety away from the menacing rook, while Black moves his Queen in position to pounce. It was suggested by a much lesser chess player that a better move for black would have been Bxe2#, but that is actually a clear blunder because it would have defeated the purpose of maintaining the significant threat of tempo established by the previous "pulled pork sandwich". } 15. b4 Qxd2+ {Now here in the 15th move of the game, Black makes the first real mistake that we have seen. The d3 pawn had several defenders, including the bishop on c1 and the knight on b1. Always keep track of the number of attackers vs the number of defenders, and remember, you need one attacker more than the number of defenders to safely take a piece in most circumstances. It would have been more wise for black to remove a defender by taking the c1 bishop with either the d3N or the a3B.  Note that Bxe2# continues to be an unqualified blunder, although it is debatable whether Bxe2# would be better or worse then Qxd2, since Black really only manages to trade his queen for a pawn and manages to go down -18 points in material as a consequence. However, there are substantial subtleties at play with Qxd2+, none more influential than the the complete and total opening of the d file, which will prove to be significant for black's coutnerattack, eventually culminating in vicegrip control of the d3 square...} 16. Nxd2 Kg7 {White is forced to take the black Queen to get out of check (and frankly it is doubtful if White would have in fact taken the Black Queen had it not been necessary for the legality of the game), while the Black King satiates his need to search for safety, as the White Queen is staring down at him on an open file. I cannot stress enough the importance of paying attention to which files are open and closed -- remember, queens and rooks love open files...Still not a good idea for black to move Bxe2#, less in this instance because of the monumental collapse of tempo that it would cause, and more due to the risk of disruption of the carefully crafted and ever so delicate balance between the pulled pork sandwich of move 14 and the truly delicious skewer of move 9.} 17. Qd6 Rd8 {White recognizes the potential threat to his King from the open d file, and so moves his Queen to help control it. Black counters by challenging the queen in that file with his rook. This also sets up Bxe2+ as a viable option by removing the possibility of #, because the struggle for control of open space in this game is now concentrated on the d file, and no longer the e...} 18. Ne4 {White } Bxe2+ {White makes a serious error by moving the d2N out of the open d file, and black takes advantage with Bxe2+, the move that black patiently waited to make until the timing was ripe for maximum results!} 19. Kd2 Bxc1+ {White's King is now under siege!} 20. Raxc1 Nxf2 {notice how black is clearing out the D file with a pesky insistence on controlling the center of the board and gaining tempo through threats of gaining material...} 21. Bxf7 Bd3 {White greedily takes the f7 pawn, without realizing the fierce discovered attack that black could set up with Bd3...} 22. Qxd8 Bc4 {Black executes the discovered attack, only to find that the white Queen is not able to check her own King. In situations like this you want to remain calm and look for opportunities to counterattack with the strong pieces you have in a threatening position, in this case, for Black that will be his King...} 23. Nf6 Kxf7 {Black begins his fierce counterattack with his King...} 24. Qe7+ Kxe7 {This next series of moves is brilliant! } 25. Rce1+ Kxf6 {Notice how the Black King continues to gain material while White slowly withers away, his substantial lead in material down to a mere +5...} 26. Rhf1 c5 {White pins the f2N, and black cannot do anything about it, and so black advances some of his pawns. Now you will see Black continue to advance his King into the attack, gaining temp in the open file in the center along the way with threats and checks. } 27. g4 Kg5 {Black breaks the pin...} 28. h4+ Kxg4 {Black continues his advance with teh King...} 29. Re7 Kf3 {Black is is position now to defend his N, but has left himself vulnerable to attack from the other rook...} 30. Rxf2+ Kxf2 {A fairly even exchange of material. Note that Black is now only down 2 points! The comeback is nearly complete! } 31. Rxa7 Bd3 {Continuing to develop the minor pieces and look for rook outposts...} 32. Rxh7 c4 {This move was the crusher! Black locks down the d3 square with this powerful pawn push, and White is helpless!} 33. a4 bxa4 {White tries in vain to break up the d3 bishop outpost, but only succeeds in granting black a passed pawn (hint hint, the winning move will come from that passed pawn!) } 34. Rg7 a3 {The black pawn is free! } 35. Rg2+ Kxg2 {The Black King is still in a strong position, and continues to rack up material gains! IN fact, Black is now finally ahead in this game! } 36. h5 Kg3 {The Chase is on!} 37. h6 Kg4 {Chasing! } 38. h7 Kg5 {Still chasing! } 39. h8=N Kf6 {The underpromotion to a Knight in this case was warranted, as White has begun to realize in this game that the Black King is much more powerful than anyone could have expected. Clearly it was more valuable to stop the Black King from advancing along the g file, and so the underpromotion to protect the g6 square was essential. Note that promotion to a Queen or Rook or Bishop would not have been able to control that g6 square -- only a knight would do the trick!} 40. b5 Ke6 {Now Black chases the other pawn! } 41. b6 Kd7 {Still chasing! } 42. b7 Kc7 {The Black King has almost caught the pawn! } 43. b8=B+ Kc6 {The underpromotion to a bishop was warranted here because getting a queen would have risked a stalemate and convoluted control of the c file, while promotion to a rook or knight would not have succeeded at checking the king in order to gain tempo. Underpromotions are unique situations, but in those rare cases, they are necessary. Also, let me approach the issue a different way -- would it be better to blatantly hang a queen or blatantly hang a bishop? I think we would all agree it would be better to irresponsibly hang a bishop, and thus there is no reason to promote to anything other than a bishop in this situation. } 44. Nf7 Kd5 {The Black king is regrouping! } 45. Be5 Ke4 {Black King is preparing to attack! } 46. Nd6+ Kxe5 {He strikes! } 47. cxd3 Kxd6 {White tries to undo the strong control of d3 black had, but only succeeded in losing his last minor piece! } 48. dxc4 Kc5 {And now the game is essentially over, as White cannot get his King over in time. } 49. Ke2 a2 {Sometimes when you are down in a chess game, it is a good idea to try running away. Unfortunately, you can only run to other squares on the chess board, and there is no J file, even with significant tempo...} 50. Kd2 Kxc4 {White realizes that if Black makes a mistake he can actually catch up to the last remaining pawn...} 51. Kc2 {Here we see basic opposition -- in an endgame situation you can control the movement of the other King by staying one square away from him, and the other King cannot advance forward. However, this opposition will be shortlived because the White King leaves himself vulnerable to a check if black underpromotes to a Knight...} a1=B {And then beautiful Finale! I would have thought you would underpromote to a Knight there, but the genuis of black in underpromoting to a bishop truly cannot be questioned....} 52. Kb1 Bh8 {For some reason White kept going trying to play it out, but to no avail...It is always better to tip your King when you are in a truly lost position -- it can be a sign of respect and an acknowledgement of an opponent's brilliance to resign before the culmination of the mating sequence...} 53. Kc2 Bc3 {But here White tries to hang on...} 54. Kd1 Be1 {and on} 55. Ke2 Bf2 {and on} 56. Kf1 Bg1 {and on} 57. Kg2 Bh2 {and on} 58. Kh1 Bg1 {and on} 59. Kxg1 {AND THE FINAL MOVE ---- } Kc3 {And with the incalculable Kc3 move, Black has finally finished White off, and White tips his King! I hope you enjoyed this lesson, its a good one for the kids out there --- a game is never so drawn that you can't ensure a loss with a resignation, especially when (as we see in the final position here) every single file is completely open and both sides have all the time in the worlds to threaten tempo & tactics while eating pulled pork sandwiches and bbq skewers...still advising against Bxe2#...Cheers!}
