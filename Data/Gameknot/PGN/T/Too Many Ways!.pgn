1. e4 {My previous annotation is debatable and to some extent agreeable, but this is highly agreeable. I don't know how my opponent managed to get in a terrible position, but I do know I had many ways to win this game. I'll show what I think is best, but you are welcome to specify any others, even if they aren't as good. Here is the start of the game, with the famous pawn push.} e5 {I was thinking of 2.d4, but I did something different.} 2. Nf3 {One of the more serious approaches to the King's Pawn Game.} Nc6 {Good. 2...d6 fine. 2...f6 is not. I still have people play 2...f6 and 3.Nxe4! wins if Black doesn't play 3...Qe7.} 3. d4 {I believe that this is the Scotch. I'm not fond of playing the Scotch, but it is worth a try.} exd4 {He takes.} 4. Nxd4 {This is the Main line of the scotch.} Ne5 {Somewhat inaccurate. Black might as well have put the Bishop on c5.} 5. Nc3 {Everything goes whacky afer this turn.} Bc5 {Maybe 6.Be3.} 6. Nf5 {?! Nope, but I know I can do better than this.} Qf6 {This make Black's move look worse than mine, although the Knight is pinned to checkmate.} 7. Be3 {This is to unpin my Knight.} Ng4 {? I think that Black is trying too hard. 7...d6 is better.} 8. Bxc5 {Maybe taking the Knight was better, but I decided to do this move, which is good for White, but unfortunate for Black.} d6 {Does 9.Bd4 look good?} 9. Bb5+ {This not my best move but it'll work smoothly.} Kd8 {The ending is near...} 10. Bd4 {Now this is a potential attack for certain.} Qe6 {Before I take the g7 pawn...} 11. Qxg4 {I am going to take yet another free piece.} Qh6 {My opponent resigns, in a definitely losing position for Black. In my view, 12.Qxg7! is the best. It threatens mate, which is rid of by 12...Qxg7 13.Bxg7 with an easy game. Tell me what you think. Anyways, my opponet thought that he had a potentially winning position, but that thought disintegrated too soon after he let his minor pieces slip away. Worse for him was that Black helped me set up an attack rather than limit my attack or get rid of it. Also, if you have more than one way to win, than you can pick that way. However, it is wise to seek the best way since the opponent can have a tactic to use against you.}
