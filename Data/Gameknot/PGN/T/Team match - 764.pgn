1. d4 {This game is a classic example of what happens when black does take to play along openning's strengths. white does a solid job in avoiding exchanges and in the end takes complete control } Nf6 2. c4 c5 {The modern benoni  The point of blacks thrust is to lure white to d5 and create a pawn imbalance on the opposite board. The disadvantage is that white usually has a slightly better game because of the enduring space advantage in the centre.  As a side note I do not recommend playing ...C5 right away. It is good to keep white guessing with ...e6. This allows you to transpose quickly into king indain lines if you feel things are not right to play the benoni. } 3. d5 d6 {...e6 is more accurate} 4. Nc3 e6 5. e4 exd5 6. cxd5 {Black seeks counter play on the queen side while white's hope to breakthrough via the e4-e5 push.} g6 7. h3 {This prevents black from trading off the bishop for white's main defender of the e5 sqaure (the knight) } a6 8. a4 {almost forced because black gets his ideal pawn chain if not played. } Bg7 {Black can avoid the main lines by playing Qe7.} 9. Nf3 Nbd7 10. Bd3 {We have reached the main-line benoni. In this position white is superior. } O-O {Thus far black has followed a very natural-looking development path. However, in this particular position they do not really offer much in the way of counter play. White is able to continue his central build up virtually unmolested, whilst sooner or later black will be left wondering how on earth he ever imagined being able to generate any real counter play. The problem for black is that he suffers from a very cramped position. Thus, he should be aiming toward exchanges. } 11. Bf4 {The bishop clearly belongs on this diagonal, bearing down the d6-pawn and supporting a future e4-e5 advance. } Qc7 {It is always difficult to decide how to defend the d-pawn in such situations, since both e7 and c7 have potential drawbacks for the queen. In principle, I would prefer e7 to c7.} 12. O-O Re8 13. Re1 Rb8 {This is a mistake black must create some space for his peices to breathe. I would prefer to try and snare the important dark bishop with ...Nh5  } 14. Qd2 c4 {it is uderstandable that black would want to play this but I think it is too risky. Maybe black should play some solid positional chess. Either ...b6 or ...Nh5 are less risky} 15. Bf1 Ne5 {This is wrong because this hems in black's important g7 bishop. I would prefer   15...Nh5 16. Bh2 Bh6 17. Bc4 Nf4 and black is on his way to equality} 16. Bxe5 dxe5 {?? Defiantly bad now black's g7 bishop looks silly} 17. a5 Bd7 {this is useful in that it blocks the d-pawn and keeps an eye on the a4-e8 diagonal} 18. Na4 {black is positionally bankrupt. As c4 is going to be impossible to hold} Bf8 {consolidating the queen side with ...Bb5 is a whole lot better than the text move} 19. Nb6 Bb5 20. Rac1 Qd6 21. Bxc4 Qb4 22. Bxb5 Qxb5 23. Rc4 {the rest of the game is just mopping up} Bc5 24. Qc3 Bxb6 25. axb6 Qxb6 26. Nxe5 Qd6 27. Nd3 Nd7 28. Rc7 Ne5 29. Nxe5 Rxe5 30. Rxb7 Rbe8 31. f3 f5 32. Qd4 fxe4 33. fxe4 h5 34. Rb6 {}
