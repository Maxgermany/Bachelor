1. e4 e5 2. d4 {usually leads to a centre game if black takes....} exd4 3. c3 {bam! the mighty Danish Gambit!} dxc3 {he accepts the first pawn} 4. Bc4 {takes a diagonal} cxb2 {accepts the second pawn} 5. Bxb2 {takes the long diagonal, and now the material advantage is his, but i control most of the board} Ne7 {not the best defence here, d5 is actually book, while d5 does give me back a pawn, it opens up blacks pieces very nicely, ne7 leads to an even more cramped position} 6. Nf3 {developing, preparing to castle, and bring the rook into play} d5 {he now tries to gambit the pawn back to me, after blocking his bishop in, not the best move really, Bg5 was better} 7. exd5 {i take the free pawn, but i can't afford to trade the bishop off yet, as im still down a pawn, and owning the diagonals is paramount in the Danish Gambit} Nf5 {freeing his bishop} 8. O-O {brings the rook into play} Bd6 {starts a kingside push, prepares to castle} 9. Re1+ {forces him to retreat either the knight or the bishop and lets me take the pawn on g7} Ne7 10. Bxg7 {now material has been equalized and i have a far superior position, note that his king is still in the middle of the board and his queen, bishop, and both knights are stuck} Rg8 {tries to drive out the bishop, puts his rook on a file with my king} 11. Qd4 {i decide to try to keep the pressure on his struggling king} a6 {bit of a waste of time, preparing b5 to drive away my bishop, which needs to move anyway} 12. Bd3 {i preempt his move and attack the pawn on h7 which would also win a bishop-rook exchange} c5 {he tries to drive out my queen and give his pieces some room} 13. Qf6 {i have to guard the bishop and the pressure on his king is mounting} Nd7 {this move was intended to move my queen away, but look at his king, completely trapped by his own pieces, and ready to fall} 14. Qg5 {keeps the guard on the bishop} f6 {can you see the mate?} 15. Bg6+ {his pawn move opened up a diagonal to his king, and because his knight is pinned, none of his pieces can defend, all he can defend with is a rook pawn} hxg6 {the only move} 16. Qxg6# {game over hope you enjoyed this one, i think this game really demonstrates the importance of space and development over material Belacqua17}
