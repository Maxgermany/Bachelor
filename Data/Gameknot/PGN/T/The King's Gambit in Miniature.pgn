1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 c6 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. d4 Bb4 {At this point, we are still within the bounds of theory: Chessbase's online database contains no fewer than 152 examples of this position.  } 6. Nge2 Nxe4 7. O-O Nxc3 8. bxc3 Bd6 9. Bxf7+ Kxf7 10. Bxf4 Bxf4 {It's not often you get to see the double question mark next to a move that looks so normal. Indeed, with black up an entire minor piece and white's pawn structure in shambles, it's natural for black to want to simplify. Nevertheless, the annotation is entirely warranted: black is completely lost in this position, being defenseless against the attack that is to come. (Interestingly, it takes my Crafty engine 1.4 billion nodes and  about twenty minutes to discover that white is far better here. I'm sure someone running Fritz or Rybka on a fast machine will get a quicker result, but this is still surprising given how intuitive the approaching tactics are.) } 11. Nxf4 Rf8 {I give this move only a single question mark because, while it allows for white to snatch a good deal of material, it is not directly losing.  Alternative variation: 11... Kg8 [This is the move recommended by the computers, with the very good rationale that it gets the black K under cover quickly. Nevertheless, it is too little, too late. One attacking line might run] 12. Qh5 d5 13. Rae1 Bd7 14. Ne6 Qe7 15. Nxg7 Qf8 16. Ne6 Qg7 17. Rf8  Qxf8 18. Qg5  Kf7 19. Rf1  Kxe6 20. Qe5#   Alternative variation: 11... d5 12. Ne6  Kxe6 ( 12...

Rf7  Qe7 [and black clearly teeters on the edge of very bad things. ]  } 12. Ne6+ Kxe6 {All alternative king moves, save one, are forced mates.   Alternative variation: 12... Ke7 13. Nxd8 Rxf1  14. Qxf1 Kxd8 15. Qf8  Kc7 16. Qxg7 [and black is down in initiative, material, and development, but is at least still alive. ]   Alternative variation: 12... Kg8 13. Rxf8  Qxf8 14. Nxf8 [and interestingly, taking this N immediately results in forced mate along the lines of] 14... Kxf8 15. Qh5 g6 16. Rf1  Kg7 17. Qe5  Kh6 18. h4 d5 19. Qf4  Kg7 20.
