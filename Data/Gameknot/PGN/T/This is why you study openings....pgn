1. d4 {In this game, black demonstrates that a gap in opening knowledge can (and will) lead to disasterous results.} g6 2. Nf3 Bg7 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Ne7 5. h4 d5 6. h5 Nbc6 7. Bg5 h6 {better is 7....f6 8.Bd2 g6} 8. Bxe7 Qxe7 9. e3 Bd7 {black miscalculates his defenses. better is 9....PdXP 10.BxP b6 11....Bb7, which is a better line and therefore better placement for black's wB.} 10. cxd5 exd5 11. Nxd5 Qd6 12. Nc3 O-O-O {this might have been black's first (only?) correct move of the game!} 13. Qb3 Rde8 14. Qxf7 {black's pawns are like clothing left out to dry in a trailer park...easy pickin's.} Re7 15. Qxg6 Qxg6 {already down a minor piece equivalent in pawns, black should not have initiated the trade. better is 15....NxP 16.QxQ PxQ 17.NxN BxN 18.0-0 ...., winning back a P.} 16. hxg6 {again...black should have attacked the weak d4-P.} Bf5 17. Nh4 Bd7 18. O-O-O Rf8 19. Rd2 Be8 {black piles up to capture the past P....} 20. g4 Rf6 {...and ends up helping his opponent.} 21. Nd5 Rxe3 {black tries to gain some recompense for a lost R. by taking the e3-P, black reduces white's pawn chain while making white's doubled pawns islands at the same time.} 22. fxe3 Rd6 23. Nf4 Ne7 24. Nf5 Nxf5 25. gxf5 {outmatched, out gunned at this point with white have 3 (count 'em!!) past pawns, black resigns, running away with his tail stuck firmly behind his very red arse.}
