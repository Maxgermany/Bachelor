1. d4 g6 2. e4 Bg7 3. Nc3 e5 4. dxe5 Bxe5 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Bc4 Nh6 7. O-O O-O 8. Nd5 c6 9. Bg5 {If black pushes the f pawn, white must then decide whether to sacrifice the knight or the bishop.  Though Nc7! (discovered check with the bishop) would give white the a rook, it would cost the bishop.  Hm, actually, white's black bishop move is starting to look better and better.} Qa5 10. Bxh6 {Instead of taking the bishop, what about white's b pawn?  Sure, white's black bishop could then pick off the rook, but then white's a rook falls to the black bishop.  Unless white moves the rook (Rb1), in which case black must respond with Bg7.  KxB follows BxB.  If white opts for the rook trade black makes out a pawn ahead.} Bxh6 11. Ne7+ {White's knight had to go somewhere.  NxB puts baby in the corner while burying black's a rook almost as deep as it currently is.  (Two moves are required to get the bishop out of the way, as opposed to one move to slide the rook back).} Kh8 12. Nxc8 Rxc8 {Free pawn.} 13. Bxf7 Bg7 14. Nd4 Rf8 15. Bc4 Qb6 16. c3 Na6 17. b3 Rf4 18. Qd3 {Better to protect that pawn with the rook, maybe.  The queen is too easy to push around.} Nc5 {Kiss e4 goodbye.} 19. Qd2 {Counter threat.  We expect this to be answered with RxP.} Nxe4 {?  How does this protect against QxR?  It isn't like that knight can fork the rooks.} 20. Qxf4 d5 21. Bd3 Rf8 22. Qg4 Nxc3 23. Ne6 Rf7 24. Qh3 {White is up four points.  Every trade works to white's further advantage.  I'm not sure why this was preferred to NxB, though it does prep BxPg6, a sweet move picking off the remaining black rook.} Ne4 {There's a good defense.  Imminent doom averted!} 25. Rae1 Rxf2 {Black trades a rook for a rook and pawn.  He'll need better swaps than that to make up those three points.  And without rooks.} 26. Bxe4 {Oh, there goes the white queen.  I'd trade a rook for a queen, even down six points.} Rf3+ 27. Kh1 Rxh3 28. gxh3 {...and doubled pawns.  Here Bc3 lets black advance the d pawn a bit, though white still has a knight to trade.  Actually, scratch that.  The bishop obviously must go down for the d pawn.} dxe4 29. Rxe4 {Doesn't it always work out the opponent's pieces become invisible to your bishop?  Black's bishop can see only one king protected pawn.} h5 30. Nxg7 Kxg7 {Trades still work to white's advantage even though the score is tied.  White has more pieces.  That black bishop was sort of worthless, though, not sure it was worth a knight.} 31. Re7+ Kh6 32. Rff7 {This splits black's right side pawns.} c5 33. Rexb7 {Free pawns!  Pawn molester.} Qc6+ 34. Kg1 c4 {?  Not even going to make a gesture?} 35. h4 {:)  Black is forced to move Pg5 to prevent sudden death.  PxP!, KxP, RxP (just because it is there)...} c3 {?  Well, that was lovely.  Better than PxP, but not good enough to prevent Rh7#.} 36. Rfh7# {}
