1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 e6 5. e3 Bb4 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. Bd3 h6 {I had to choose here.. Allowing the knight on e4 or not. I prefer not to but to make him able to play for it. He has to play g5 .. That way his kingside is weakened so i decided to allow it.} 8. Bh4 Qc7 {This move gives the Bisschop beeing on g3 more power so i totally did not mind.} 9. O-O g5 10. Bg3 {And there we go} Bd6 {If he opens my f file now, i will be a happy man} 11. c5 Bxg3 12. fxg3 {This position doesn't look very healthy for white but it gives me a lot of tactical options. The Knight on d7 doesnt have many squares to go too as example, his position is kind a locked. } Nf8 13. Ne5 Qe7 {All i can do at this point is building up some pressure} 14. Qf3 Nf8d7 {And back to d7 where it belongs :P} 15. Nxd7 Nxd7 {Black looks to be out of problems here} 16. e4 Rg8 17. exd5 Nf8 18. d6 Qd7 {Not sure if both sides playd the best moves here but i think white is position is really strong now.. black is pulled back.. white has a strong f file The queen must stay at d7 for a bit cause of the checkmate with Qf7x if black queens move to d8. d7 is the only allowed square for black.} 19. Ne4 {plan is easy.. the queen is still not allowed to go to d8. To be honest.. I was really thinking i had wun here.. but then he playd Rook g7.. that move was earlier a bad move cause my bisschop is attacking g7. but the bisschop diagnol is blocked now} Nh7 20. Qh5 {Lets build up something new ;) Knight h7 is taking care of the f6 square. If I allow black to move up that f pawn.. He will be relieved of his problems .. I didn't want that ;)} Kf8 {He has to be carefull now. His knight has no squares to go too.. } 21. Qxh6+ {one attacker, one defender} Rg7 22. Nc3 {2 attackers one defender still..} b6 {Blunder. He could defend his knight ones more by playing King g8 or to move up the f pawn} 23. Bxh7 Qd8 {I dont the idea about this move but it gives me more advantages} 24. Rxf7+ Kxf7 25. Rf1+ {And I win the offered Rook back cause the king canÂ´t defend it anymore. And he resigned}
