1. e4 e6 2. d4 c5 3. Nf3 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 {A rare continuation. The idea is to reach a position similar to the Kan where Black has not wasted a tempo with ...a6.  White has to be accurate to obtain an advantage.} 5. Nb3 Be7 {I was a little bemused at this point.  Black seems to have lost a tempo, but White's Knight is not ideally placed.  5.Nb5 just didn't seem to work.} 6. Nc3 d6 7. Bd3 a6 8. Be3 {Simply O-O and White has a good game.  At this point I am thinking castling long which I now think is a mistake.} b5 {Black starts a minority attack.} 9. Qe2 {Not to late to play O-O, but I stubbornly continue to play for O-O-O even though it means castling right into Black's attack. } Bb7 10. f3 {White still could play O-O.  The most popular idea in the datebase was for White to play a combination of f4 and O-O-O.  I had actually noticed that Black did well in those games, and that White did better when he castled short.  Playing f3 with the idea of playing a type of English Attack at least got me out of the database.} Nc6 11. a3 {?! Somehow I thought this slowed down Black's queenside play, and perhaps it does temporarily; but it makes it all the more stronger when it finally comes.} Nf6 12. O-O-O Qc7 {Black definitely has an edge now.} 13. g4 {At least I am consistent.} b4 {Now how was 11.a3 supposed to help here?} 14. axb4 Nxb4 15. g5 Nd7 16. h4 {?! There just aren't any targets for White's kingside play.  } Nb6 {?! Better for Black would be 16.... Ne5} 17. Rh2 {One asset I do have is more space and ranks to maneuver my rooks.  Black is confined to his first rank to get his rooks into play.} a5 {?! I think Black would do better striking in the center with 17...d5.} 18. Bb5+ {There was a time that I would have believed that for White to seek counterplay on the Queenside was strategically wrong.  This move takes advantage of the fact that Black has not castled yet and can't get his rooks into play as fast as White can.  I decided to seek active play on the queenside.  If I can trade some pieces to where I no longer need to fear a king hunt then I have an extra piece (the king) on the queenside and can fight effectively on that wing.} Bc6 {18...Kf8 comes into consideration.} 19. Bxc6+ Qxc6 20. Qb5 {?? Consistent, but there is a big tactical flaw.  White could have equalized here with 20.Nd4!} Nc4 {??  My opponent returns the favor with a counter-blunder.  20...Na2+ would have been devastating.  21. Kd2 Nc4+ 22.Ke1 Qxb5 23.Nxb5 Nxe3-+} 21. Qxc6+ {and now the game is equal.} Nxc6 22. Re1 {22.Bg1 is probably better.} Nc6e5 23. Nd4 O-O 24. b3 Nxe3 25. Rxe3 Rfc8 26. Na4 Rab8 27. Rc3 Rxc3 28. Nxc3 Rb4 29. Rd2 Rb6 30. Na4 {And here in an absolute equal position, my opponent timed out.  I think he had computer problems as he timed out in several games.}
