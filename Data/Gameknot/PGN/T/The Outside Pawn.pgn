1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here I am, playing black in my Sneaky Knights Group 3 Team Mini-tournament.  Towards the latter part of the middlegame/early endgame I find myself in big bother again.  I end up a pawn down in a knight ending but incredibly I win it!  How, well, there is the little matter of the outside passed pawn.  I find myself playing the Schelecter Variation of the Goring Gambit after a double king pawn opening (e4, e5).} e5 2. d4 {2. d4 - this move will be the Centre Game if after 2..... exd4 3. Qxd4 but white has other ideas, a gambit.  } exd4 3. c3 {3. c3 ...... the Goring Gambit .....} dxc3 {3. ..... dxc3 - ...... Accepted.} 4. Bc4 cxb2 5. Bxb2 {5. Bxb2 - after this white has a large lead in development with two bishops raking down on my kingside position.  I must address this matter immediately and I take the main line which is 5. ....d5.} d5 6. Bxd5 Nf6 {6. ...... Nf6 - one of the pawns is returned to speed up development.} 7. Bxf7+ Kxf7 8. Qxd8 {8. Qxd8 - Quel Horreure!  It looks as if I have lost my queen, but there is a way out of this.} Bb4+ {8. ...... Bb4+ - Fou Lenoir develops giving a very important check.  It is important because however white responds to the check, the rook on h1 removes the Wicked Witch of the West (good riddance I say!) next move.} 9. Qd2 {9. Qd2 - he blocks but now Fou Lenoir can read her the last rites instead!} Bxd2+ {9...... Bxd2+ - so ding dong the Wicked Witch is dead!  White recaptures with Nxd2 developing a piece.} 10. Nxd2 Re8 11. f3 Nc6 {11. ..... Nc6 - development.} 12. Ne2 b6 13. O-O Ba6 {13. ..... Ba6 - out comes Fou Leblanc and my rooks are now connected.  Already the game has an endgame feel to it.} 14. Rfe1 Rad8 15. Nb3 Nb4 {15. ..... Nb4 - trying to make something out of this position.} 16. Nbd4 Nd3 17. Reb1 Nxb2 18. Rxb2 Bxe2 19. Nxe2 {19. Nxe2 - over the last few moves, two sets of minor pieces have been traded, now it is almost an endgame with just the rooks and one pair of knights on the board.  I now do what I think is best - play c5 because it pushes up my passed pawn.} c5 20. a4 {20. a4! - this move threatens to undermine my queenside pawn structure.  Now watch - passivitis now creeps in, starting with the move Rb8.} Rdb8 21. Nc3 Re7 22. Rd1 Rd7 23. Rxd7+ Nxd7 {23. ..... Nxd7 - one pair of rooks have been traded but white can now increase the tension.} 24. f4 {24. f4 - white now decides to push forward his pawn majority.} a6 25. Kf2 {25. Kf2 - white now begins to centralise his king.} g6 26. g4 Rb7 27. e5 {25. e5 - further expansion for white on the kingside.} Nf8 28. Ne4 {28. Ne4!! - Nasty, Nasty, this move should have won for white.  Take note.  Firstly my c5 pawn is "protected" by the c6 pawn which is pinned to my rook on b7.  Secondly, Henry and that same rook are perfectly lined up for a knight fork on d6.  I decided to move my rook out of the firing line but I must now lose a pawn.} Rb8 29. a5 {29. a5 - hmm, I expected Nxc5 but maybe this move is just as good as it still wins a pawn.} Nd7 30. axb6 Rxb6 31. Rxb6 Nxb6 32. Nxc5 {32. Nxc5 - white duly wins his pawn but I am not quite ready to wave the white flag yet, that little outside pawn on the a column can become a big nuisance to white.  You will see just how over the next few moves.} a5 33. Nd3 a4 {33. ..... a4 - onward little soldier!} 34. Nb4 a3 {34. ..... a3 - just two squares away from Glendadom now!} 35. h4 Nd5 {35. ...... Nd5 - setting white a trap.  If Nxd5 then Glenda will return in all her splendour on a1.  He does not fall for it and blocks my pawn with 36. Na2.} 36. Na2 Nxf4 {36. ...... Nxf4 - but my horsie was also attacking a loose pawn on f4 and now he tramples on it!  Material is even but I think I have the advantage here because white's horise is tied to preventing that outside passer from reaching Glendadom and now the e5 pawn is very weak as a result.  Henry is licking his lips, P(r)awn Marie Rose as a starter for his repast if he comes home from the battlefield a winner!} 37. Kf3 Nd5 38. Ke4 Ke6 {38. ..... Ke6 - but it is gonna be a while before I can round it up.} 39. Kd4 Ne7 {39. ....... Ne7 - this retreat seems strange but I threaten Nc6 winning the e5 pawn.} 40. Ke4 {40. Ke4 - He cannot prevent Nc6 because if he tries to stop my knight from going there by Kc5 then Henry will make Prawn Marie Rose of all the kingside pawns and the white king may only get the a pawn as a consolation.  My two kingside pawns will then race each other to Glendadom.} Nc6 41. Kf4 h6 {41. ..... h6 - no hurry to take off the e5 pawn, firstly some prophylaxis on the h and g columns to stop the WK eating my kingside pawns.} 42. g5 h5 {42. ..... h5 - I now set up Operation Joblock - the WK cannot now get at my kingside pawns and now the e5 pawn will drop off and does next move.} 43. Ke4 Nxe5 44. Nc3 Nc4 45. Kf4 Nd6 {45. .... Nd6 - my horise now has his eye on the pawn on h4.  I now threaten Nf5 which will win it next move.} 46. Na2 {46. Na2? - hastens the end - Kg3 would have held on to that h4 pawn.  I now play Nf5 as planned.  Now it is lost and so is white's game.  He will now drop a second pawn and he cannot do anything about it.  White acknowledges this and waves the white flag.  Yet another lucky win for that Jo Stevens.} Nf5 {}
