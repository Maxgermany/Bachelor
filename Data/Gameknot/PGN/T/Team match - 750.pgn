1. d4 e6 2. e4 f6 {? what was the idea? why not to play a regular french? by that move, it will be hard for black to develope his king side pieces.} 3. f3 {3. Nf3 is better in order to prevent e5 from black.} e5 4. c3 exd4 5. cxd4 {white is left with a strong center.} Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 {white has a great space to play in and a strong center. black had not move any piece yet.} d6 8. d5 {maybe too soon. I think that Bc4 is much better.} c6 9. c4 {white has played with his pawns too far. it is important to remember that pawns cant play backwards and they need pieces to support them from behind.} c5 10. Bf4 g5 11. Bg3 a6 {black is playing wierd too. why isnt he developing pieces?} 12. Bd3 h5 13. Ne2 h4 14. Bf2 b6 {strange game... black is moving too fast with his pawns too instead of playing moves such as Nd7-e5, Ne7-g6 etc.} 15. a4 a5 16. O-O Qe7 {at last! black moved a piece!} 17. Qb3 {I think that h3 is important in order to prevent the same from black.} h3 18. g3 g4 19. f4 {now the e4 square is weak. black has pawns in the king side that pressing the white king.} Nd7 20. f5 {what else can be done? black wanted to play f5! himself.} Ne5 21. Qxb6 Nf3+ {! fiest - put the white king on h1 where taking later the e4 pawn will be with a check.} 22. Kh1 Ne5 23. Be1 {?? white did not notice that black is willing to sacrifice the rook and give white a mate. Bc2 was necessary.} Nxd3 24. Qc6+ Kf7 25. Qxa8 Qxe4+ {the end.}
