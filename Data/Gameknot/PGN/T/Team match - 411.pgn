1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 c5 4. dxc5 Bg7 {there is no rush to recover the pawn} 5. a3 Ne4 6. Qd5 {this leads to some interesting play, but to white's disadvantage.} f5 7. Nbd2 e6 8. Qd3 Nxc5 9. Qd6 {this leads to trouble.  9 Qc2 was much better.  Now by a series of developing moves black gets a winning position.} b6 10. e3 Nc6 11. Be2 Bf8 12. Qf4 d6 {here white probably should have admitted his error and played h3 providing an escape square for his queen even though he does not stand well.} 13. O-O e5 14. Qh4 Be7 15. Qh6 e4 16. Nd4 Ne5 {already threatening ... Nf7 and ... f4.} 17. b4 Bg5 18. Qg7 Bf6 19. Qh6 Nf7 20. Qh3 f4 21. g4 {much analysis was done here.  It came down to a choice between 21 ... h5 and 21 ... Ng5.  ... h5 while possibly not bad is murky.  the main analysis involving ... Ng5 is as follows:  22 Qh4?? Nf3+ wins.  On the 22 Qh6 and 22 Qg2 lines 22 ... f3 leads to material gain for black.  the main things which had to be worked out were the correct way of recapturing on f3.  In terms of tactical details the possibility of bxc5 for white and Bxa1 for black had to be figured out.  In some lines white winds up a rook down.  In the line he chose in the game (which was best) he wound up down a piece for two pawns.    } Ng5 22. Qg2 f3 23. Nd2xf3 Nxf3+ 24. Bxf3 exf3 25. Qxf3 Bb7 26. Qe2 Na6 27. Bb2 {Threatening Ne6 and in some cases Nc6.} Qe7 28. e4 O-O {putting some pressure on the "e" pawn and preparing to put pressure on the "c" pawn as well.  } 29. f3 Nc7 30. Rad1 a6 {hereabouts black was thinking in terms of how to get his light squared bishop into play.} 31. Nb3 Be5 32. Bxe5 dxe5 33. Qe3 Rf6 34. c5 bxc5 35. Nxc5 Bc6 36. f4 Bb5 {this required a lot of work.  The point of this move was to force the rook off of f1 and bar that square to the other rook.  This is important in lines where white can play Rxf6 and black must be able to reply Qxf6 not having to worry about a Rf1 by white if black has played ... Kf8 in response to a queen check.  Whether black can force a win at this point is in question particularly if most of the pieces come off the board and white has a rook left at that point.} 37. Rf3 Rd8 {The hardest move to find in the game.  I believe this was the only winning chance.} 38. Rxd8+ Qxd8 39. fxe5 Rxf3 40. Qxf3 Qd4+ 41. Kg2 Qb2+ {I am inclined to view this as an error since white gets some chances in the ending.  Correct was 41 ... Qxe5 after which white has to do some thinking to find some moves.} 42. Kg3 Qxe5+ 43. Qf4 Qxf4+ 44. Kxf4 Kf7 45. Ke5 Ke7 46. g5 {this makes things easier, though in truth, black should win a piece up for two pawns.} Bc6 {a little jockeying with the bishop to force a zugswang and allow black to improve his position.} 47. a4 Be8 48. h4 Bc6 49. Nxa6 {this sacrifice doesn't work, but white doesn't have anything.} Nxa6 50. b5 Bb7 {this finish is easily won for black thanks to the zugswang mechanism.} 51. bxa6 Bxa6 52. Kd5 Bb7+ 53. Kc5 Bxe4 54. a5 Ke6 55. Kb5 Kf5 {}
