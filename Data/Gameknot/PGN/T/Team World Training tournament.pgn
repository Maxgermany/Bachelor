1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Don't often see this move played, still I carried on the way I normally would after Nc6.} 3. Bc4 h6 4. d4 {If he's going to play a bit defensive I'll attack.} Bg4 5. Be3 Nf6 6. dxe5 Nxe4 7. Bxf7+ {Sac the bishop to get my queen into the game and eliminate the knight posted in a good position.} Kxf7 8. Qd5+ Ke8 9. Qxe4 Bxf3 10. Qxf3 {Happy so far with my position.} Nc6 11. e6 {Threatening mate.} Qe7 12. Qf5 {Protecting the pawn which will be a massive headache.} g5 13. Nc3 Ne5 {Bad move in my opinion, it allows the queen to move and protect against the mate but had to protect d5. Thoughts on this?} 14. Nd5 Qh7 15. Nf6+ Ke7 16. Nxh7 Bg7 17. Bd4 Kd8 18. Bxe5 dxe5 {Should have taken with bishop.} 19. O-O-O+ {No way in avoiding mate from here.} Ke8 20. Qf7# {}
