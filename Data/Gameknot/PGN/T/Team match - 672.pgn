1. e4 {This is my first annotated game and one that I feel shows the importance of developing lines of attack. It is the second team game I had against this opponnet with him winning a decisive victory in only 9 moves by playing totally in a style that I wasn't use to. So at the beginning of this game I felt I had to develop a strong defence. Any comments/ views  would be appreciated!} c5 {Standard Sicilian defence} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {To take pawn allows white to devop better in the centre} a6 4. dxc5 e5 5. Bc4 b5 {Qa4 may have been better but again was thinking defencely} 6. cxb6 e.p. {Didn't see enpassant!!} Qxb6 {Didn't want to bring queen out so early but little other options} 7. Qd5 {White plays aggressively going for pawn f4 and possibility of destroying kingside defences.} Nd8 {Obvious defencive move} 8. Qxe5+ {white takes pawn on e5 controlling the centre and making me very worried!!} Ne6 {Obvious defence } 9. b3 {I think white should have played Ng5 to add further pressure?? But could also see that whites next move would be Bb2 however} Bc5 {The move allows me to open a line of attack my first chance of the game} 10. O-O {White rightly castles} Nf6 {This allows me to develop knight and block queens diagonal} 11. Nc3 {White continues with development and defence of e4 pawn} d6 {The queen is bothering me and I want to move it before I castle} 12. Qg3 {I now see a way of capturing whites queen} Nh5 {If white moves Qh3 then Ng5 will ensure queen is captured however} 13. Qh4 {Opponnent sees my plan} Nf6 {I retreat} 14. Rd1 {White lines up rook for possibility of later attack??} Bb7 {I now open up second diagonal of attack. Both bishops are in good positions and I am happy} 15. Bb2 {White follows suit.} O-O-O {With whites attack strongly on kingside I now castle on queen side!!} 16. e5 {Again I feel under pressure so attack queen} g5 {White has no other option as white queen has no where else to go so exchanges} 17. Bxe6+ {bishop for knight} fxe6 {I take the bishop again feel as I am in a better position as whites attack isn't well developed} 18. Qxg5 {I feel white made a blunder here as now will allow me to open yet another line of attack which will cost him the game} Rhg8 {Rhg8 now supports attck on g2 pawn with added pressure from bishop and queen white was now in trouble} 19. Qxf6 {Queen takes knight sacrifice and I can put my final attack together.} Bxf2+ {Checking king and hoping that white will move king to h1} 20. Kh1 {Which he does} dxe5 {I take pawn hoping that white will fall into the trap and take pawn on e5 with knight which he does} 21. Nxe5 Bxg2# {Checkmate. I suppose I got lucky in the end but still feel the game warrants annotation as it shows the importance of good lines of attack. I hope you enjoyed it. }
