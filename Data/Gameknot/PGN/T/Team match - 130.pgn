1. e4 c5 2. d4 {Reasonably common series of moves.} Nc6 {We are now out of the openings book, but my opponent's move seems fine to me, because it pressures a centre pawn.} 3. Nf3 {I support d5 with my knight.} Nxd4 4. Nxd4 cxd4 5. Qxd4 {Should I have brought out my queen this early?} Qa5+ {Check.} 6. Nc3 {Is this OK, or is c3 better?} b6 7. Qd5 {I offer a queen exchange so I can get unopposed control of the centre.} b5 {? This gives away a pawn and allows me to re-offer the exchange at the same time.} 8. Qxb5 Qc7 9. Nd5 {I'm trying to get the queen away from the area of c7 so I can do Nc7+.} Qd6 10. Bf4 {Black can no longer defend c7 without losing his queen.} Qg6 11. Nc7+ {Check.} Kd8 12. Nxa8 e6 {I suppose Black is trying to get some control of the centre and develop his DSB.} 13. Qa5+ {At this point, I decide to try for a mate.} Ke7 14. Qc5+ {Check.} d6 15. Qxd6+ Kf6 {Ke8 would mean a mate in one by Nc7#.} 16. Qd8+ {Check. Mate in 2.} Be7 {Blocks the flight square of e7.} 17. Qd4+ {Check.} e5 {Only move.} 18. Qxe5# {Checkmate!
