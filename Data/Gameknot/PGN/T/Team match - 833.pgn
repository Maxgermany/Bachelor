1. d4 c6 2. c4 d5 3. Nf3 Bf5 4. Qb3 Qc7 {I think, Qb6 is better. I saw, that now he cannot play Bf4 - but it is a mistake. After Nc3 I cannot give a mate on c1. Bf4 Qxf4 Qxb7 Qc1# now.} 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. cxd5 cxd5 7. Bf4 Qb6 8. Qxb6 axb6 9. e3 e6 10. Nh4 {My pawnstructure will be bad on both side. I can playing just for a draw.} Bg6 11. Nxg6 hxg6 12. Bb5+ {Bxb8 was maybe better.} Nc6 13. Bc7 Nd7 14. O-O Rc8 15. Bf4 Nf6 16. a4 Bb4 {Now the position seems to me near the equal. I was happy and hopeful at this time.} 17. Rfc1 Kd7 {To connect the rooks and playing for the h-file.} 18. f3 Bd6 {To centralise the king for an endgame.} 19. Bxd6 Kxd6 20. Rcd1 Na5 {Try to make some problem on the Queenside.} 21. e4 {To open files for the rooks - it is a lost position anyway.} dxe4 22. fxe4 Ng4 23. e5+ Ke7 24. h3 Ne3 25. Rd3 Nd5 26. Rc1 Nb3 {The last mistake.} 27. Nxd5+ {}
