1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Most played moves in the first moves of a chess game,i think.} 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 {The counter attack starts.} 5. Nxf7 {He forks the queen and rook.But no matter,i will win a pawn for now.} Bxf2+ 6. Kf1 {He doesn't capture the bishop because 6.Kxf2 Axe4  black gains tempo and with 7...d5 he gets a strong attack.} Qe7 {Naturally, i  prefer queen than the rook.} 7. Nxh8 {He takes my rook.} d5 {I will give the pawn to let my bishop a free diagonal.} 8. exd5 Nd4 9. Kxf2 Ne4+ {Gaining tempo when he captures the bishop and this attack will force to draw.} 10. Kg1 Qh4 11. g3 Nxg3 12. hxg3 Qxg3+ 13. Kf1 Bh3+ 14. Rxh3 Qxh3+ 15. Kf2 Qh2+ {i have checked again and again cause i did not want to try to find the winning line.It was good to draw a higher rated player i thought and did not wanna take risk.However no development at white's side maybe i could win.If someone found the winning variation please tell me.} 16. Ke3 Qf4+ {And with triple repeat game was decided as draw.} 17. Kd3 Qg3+ 18. Ke4 Qf4+ 19. Kd3 Qg3+ 20. Ke4 Qf4+ 21. Kd3 {Here is the final position.}
