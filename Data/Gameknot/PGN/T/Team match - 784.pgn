1. e4 {***ANNOTATION UNFINISHED*** This was a real struggle for me, since I played the opening in a very wishful style, neglecting opening principals, and quickly found myself in a pickle of a situation. I played the game for a draw from early on and a late blunder from my opponent allowed me to seize a win in this one. } e5 {1. e4 e5 - responding in the center, the position well known to everyone.} 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. Nf3 d6 4. d4 {White challenges Black's central development} Bb4 {In stead of making a simple trade of pawns on d4, I tried to make some fancy gambit, that clearly was out of place :)} 5. dxe5 {Taking back on e5 would deny me from castling, so I went with this weird gambit. Gambits are usually about giving material in order to gain time or space or lines, but in this case i didn't really gain much of anything, other than a weaker position.} h6 {I was a bit disturbed of the possible Bg5, tying me down completely in the center. I overlooked this move when taking a shot with that weird 4. ... Bb4 attempt :)} 6. exd6 {White gains a pawn of material advantage} Qxd6 7. Qxd6 Bxd6 {My Bishop moved 3 times in this opening which is a clear disadvantage. My weak Q-side is now vulnerable to the White Knight on c3} 8. Nb5 Nc6 {Needed to defend the e5 square, - I could loose a rook if my bishop on d6 would be forced to move.} 9. Nxd6+ cxd6 10. Bf4 {A simple combination attacks my weak isolated d6 pawn and enables the long castle for White} Nf6 {If Bxd6, Black can capture the pawn on e4, not letting the material deficit to grow.} 11. Bd3 {defends the e4 pawn, but I think Bxd6 was stronger. If White were to keep his Bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, that would keep the Black King vulnerable in the center. I suppose Black wasn't sure whether to castle long or short and decided to keep his options open by developing the second bishop...} d5 {Weak pawns must be pushed. This evades the attack from the f4 Bishop and offers a comfortable exchange for Black.} 12. e5 {White denies the exchange and instead decides to push the Black Knight away. A White pawn can often be very strong on e5 if Black castles short, but I believe this isn't the case. Black's mobility felt more strangled with that pawn on e4.  12. e5 advances the relocation of the Black Knight on f6, so I'd say While lost some time with this move, though he probably lost it with 11. Bd3.  Notice also that this pawn now blocks the Bishop's access to the a3-f8 diagonal. If White would attempt to regain access to it with e6, then my d5 pawn would no longer be isolated and Black would gain some needed space in the center. I think this move more than any other allowed me to think of a realistic draw.} Nd7 {The Knight prepares to jump into c5 and hopefully exchange with the Bishop on d3. Keeping bishops of opposite color on the board makes a draw a lot more likely. I've been hoping for a draw ever since I made that weird 4. ... Bb4, so I felt that drawing the game would be a small victory for me.} 13. h3 {I imagine White was either worried about the mobility of his f4 Bishop in case Black attacks it with g5 or perhaps to deny the g4 square for my c8 bishop in the future... either way I believe this just gave me time to reorganize and catch up with White's development.} Nc5 {My Knight completes the relocation to a better square, attacking the Bishop on d3 and eyeing over the e6 square } 14. O-O-O {Another move that I think wasn't too strong - the White King doesn't look right on the Queen-side. The c file is semi-open and Black rooks would eventually feel very comfortable on it. The White King would look a lot safer on the King-side. At least that is my opinion... I don't see what purpose that White King could perform on the Queen-side... a simple Rd1 would have made more sense.} Nxd3+ {Black achieves the first goal and leaves bishops of opposite color on the board. Next goal is to exchange the knights and to go into the endgame asap.} 15. Rxd3 Be6 {Defending the pawn on e5 rather solidly. Momentarily solving the d5 pawn's safety makes Blacks life a lot easier} 16. Nd4 {It appears White also wanted to go into the endgame, but this allows me to follow through with the goal of exchanging Knights and leaving bishops of opposite color on the board. White has a better position and clearly wants to win the game, but White doesn't seem to grasp the strategic nuances of having bishops of opposite color on the board.} Nxd4 {Black happily trades the Knights} 17. Rxd4 {The White rook moved from d1 to d3 then d4 - these exchanges have given Black some more time and a lot more breathing room (space).} b5 {With the King side pawns somewhat dominated by that e5 pawn, Black needs to gain some space on the Queen-side. Notice also that although the Black King didn't castle Kingside, this feels a lot like a position in which sides would castle opposite. In such situations, activity is the key - must go for the King. Should Black castle short, it's life would be very difficult to cope with the pawn storm on the Kingside, so in fact Black doesn't intend to caste and will instead help defend the weak center. 17. ... b5 also helps to prevent White from quickly opening files for the White rooks.} 18. a4 {White challenges the b5 pawn, trying to open any files at all} a6 {Of course, taking on a4 would be suicidal. The pawn on b5 is very important and worth defending. Opening the a file is not a good idea for White with the White King on the first rank open to the pin of the Rook...} 19. Re1 {Relocating the rook eliminates possible material loss should the a file be opened} Ke7 {The Black King is needed in the center, close to the Queen-side material deficit to compensate for that missing pawn.} 20. Red1 {It took that rook 2 moves to get to d1 - another victory in time for Black} Rhc8 {The Black h Rook takes position on the semi-open c file. White may have intended to exchange pawns on b5, then after push the pawns to b3 and c4 to open up the d file... but this plan takes too much time. Black has other ideas for the Queen-side. A possible Rook exchange on c4 would be perfect for Black - a trade of rooks on c4 would help solidify the Black pawn structure, provide some well needed central control and possibly free the Black Bishop on e6 from its defensive duties to the isolated d5 pawn.} 21. g4 {White begins an attempt to storm the K-side} Rc4 {Offering an exchange of rooks and blocking White Rook's defense on the a4 pawn.} 22. axb5 {White is thinking materialisticly and decides to exchange the a4 pawn rather than allowing to level the material. Double pawns on the a file however never was a plan Black would pursue, so this simplification again is better to Black} axb5 {White allowed to open up the a file. This provides Black with favorable lines for exchanging the rooks.} 23. Be3 {This move evades the pin and allows the White rook on d4 to move away freely. White is avoiding the trade of rooks to keep the Black's b and d pawns isolated. This move also prepares the move Kd2, which was not possible without the white bishop on e3, because the d4 rooks would have been left unguarded.} Ra1+ {By exchanging pawns on b5 my opponent has allowed me to exchange the rooks and complete the transition into an endgame with bishops of opposite color} 24. Kd2 {White only has one move} Rxd1+ {Following with my plan to steer the game into the endgame with bishops of opposite color.} 25. Kxd1 {This exchange brings the White King back to the first rank. In bishops of opposite colors endgame, king mobility is highly important, because the bishop alone can only cover half of the squares on the board. The White King is now farther from action, so this buys Black more time.} Kf8 {Trading the last pair of rooks at this point would have been loosing for Black since Black has too many weaknesses. White has a much better pawn structure. White's King-side pawn majority (4 to 3) will likely keep the Black King tied down to the King side and Black's light-square bishop will not be capable of defending both isolated b and d pawns. Black currently has too many weaknesses to expect a drawish endgame and a plan of defending the isolated b and d pawns with the king would leave the King-side pawns vulnerable to the overwhelming majority of an extra pawn, the dark-square bishop bishop and the Black King.} 26. Kd2 {White improves the King's position, bringing it back to the second rank. If the White King moves to d3, then exchanging rooks on d4 would be loosing for Black.} Rc8 {Black currently must regroup in hopes of weakening the White's pawn structure before exchanging the rooks} 27. f4 g6 28. f5 gxf5 29.
