1. e4 {This is my third annotation. With help from blake84120, I have sort of gotten the hang of annotating. This game was played shortly after defeating concertino in an earlier match and is a great player and a person I have made friends with. Firstly, I always open with the king's pawn going two spaces. } e5 {He comes back with a very common opening for black.} 2. Nf3 {I open with a knight. I do this commonly, or otherwise I open with my queen which isn't such a great decision.} Qf6 {However! concertino's queen comes into play.} 3. Nc3 {I decide to defend my pawn, considering there is not much else to do.} Nc6 {So here comes concertino's knight to come defend his pawn on e5.} 4. d4 {So I open up my bishop and queen by moving to d4.} exd4 {Not unexpectedly, exd4 occurs, putting my knight on c3 under attack.} 5. Nd5 {I move my knight to go attack the queen, whilst being protected by my pawn.} Qd6 {The queen moves to d6.} 6. Bf4 {My bishop moves to f4 as I try to get all my pieces into the middle of the board.} Ne5 {concertino's knight moves to e5.} 7. Bxe5 {I take at e5. What was concertino thinking?} Qe7 {Now here comes the questionable part of the game. Why did concertino move Qe7 allowing me to take his queen?} 8. Nxe7 {Of course, I go for it. Sometimes, it can be a sacrificial checkmate, but I couldn't see anything, as most of his pieces were still at the back of the board.} Bxe7 {concertino moves Bxe7 which is definitely not unexpected, unless he moved Kxe7.} 9. Bxg7 {The last move of the game resulted me taking the pawn at g7 with my bishop and trapping his rook to be taken, forcing concertino to resign the match. Thank you to concertino for being such a great friend and opponent and to blake84120 for teaching me how to annotate!}
