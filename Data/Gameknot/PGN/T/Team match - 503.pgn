1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {So far a standard opening.} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nxd4 5. Qxd4 {An early explosive exchange.} Nf6 {d6 is more common here.} 6. e5 {Charge!} Qe7 {Pin the pawn.} 7. Be2 {Release the pin and permit the castle.} Ng8 {Knight retreats to the only safe place} 8. O-O {Castled.   Note the contrast in development.} f6 9. f4 Qc5 {Aiming for an exchange of queens.} 10. c3 {I prefer to recapture giving a strong pawn center.} Qxd4+ 11. cxd4 {The exchange} fxe5 12. fxe5 {I now have a strong pawn center and mostly developed pieces. Black only has a developed bishop.} h6 {This is a little passive.} 13. Nc3 {Knight heads out on its classic march.} d6 {This is a start of an attack onto the pawn center.} 14. Nd5 {This is effectively the winning move.  Everything goes downhill from here for black. I am threatening Nxc7+ However the king needs to defend the bishop. } Kd8 {Black decides to keep the rook. (Why not Rb8?)} 15. Rxf8+ {Now the rook is where it wants to be1} Kd7 {Forced move.} 16. Bg4+ {Adding more pressure to the attack} Kc6 {Forced (again)} 17. Ne7+ {More pain from the knight} Kb5 18. Bxc8 {Start the exchanges} Nxe7 {Swapping a knight for a rook} 19. Rxh8 Rxc8 {Now trading a bishop and rook for the other rook} 20. Rxc8 Nxc8 21. e6 {More fun with passed pawns} Kc6 22. Bd2 {This gets my rook into play} Ne7 {Passed pawns should be treated like a dangerous criminal (A.N.).} 23. Re1 {Rook supports the passed pawn} Kd5 24. g4 {Lets see if black will take the poison pawn} Kxd4 {munch} 25. Bc3+ {Its a trap!} Kc5 26. Bxg7 {I get my pawn back with interest.} a6 {Another bad move. I had expected Ng8} 27. Bf8 {Drive away the knight.} Nd5 {Still not gone to g8} 28. e7 {The passed pawn makes its break.  At which point black resigns.   If the exchange had gone ahead white would have two passed pawns the wrong side of a rook.}
