1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 4. Bb5+ Nbd7 5. Be2 {Playing this after Bb5, rather than immediately means black can't immediately retake on d5 with his queen after the exchange of bishops.} Bxe2 6. Nxe2 Nxd5 {Probably incorrect. White now gets to grab some space by playing c4. Better may have been to play Nb6 first, which covers c4 and also might allow to take with the queen instead.} 7. c4 Nd5b6 8. c5 {playing for the fork with the queen on b3 on the next turn} Nd5 {Only Nc8 would allow to avoid the upcoming fork to win the pawn on b7, but that seems way to passive, especially compared to this square, which is an excellent outpost for the knight.} 9. Qb3 e6 10. Nbc3 Nd7f6 11. Bg5 Be7 {Here I had the opportunity to defend b7, but since white has removed his bishop from defense of b2, it seems to me that I should be able to get enough activity by bringing my rook to b2 in case white takes on b7, especially if all my pieces are well developed.} 12. O-O O-O 13. Qxb7 Rb8 14. Qc6 {This is a bit strange to me. Now I get to take on b2 and be out of the opening stage relatively care free. If white would have taken on a7, he would at least be a pawn up.} Rxb2 15. Rab1 Rxb1 16. Nxb1 {After 16. Rxb1 Nxc3 17.Nxc3 Qxd4 18. Qxc7 Bxc5, white is down a pawn. Taking with the knight instead of the rook prevents that, but now black's pieces are looking more active.} Ne4 {Starting to activate my more active pieces.} 17. Be3 {Avoiding the trade doesn't seem right to me, since the white bishop doesn't  seem too stron with white's pawns blocking it.} Bg5 {Black's position is looking more and more powerful.} 18. Kh1 {This move means that Nxe3 xe3 Bxe3 winning a pawn is now prevented, since the check was necessary to ensure that the pawn could be taken before securing the knight on e4} Qf6 {Bishop is now threatened because of the pin on the f-pawn and the move brings out the queen to more threatening squares as well.} 19. f4 {Protecting the white bishop, as Nxe3 can still be met with Qxe4, but because of the pin, there is no urgency for white to get his bishop to safety either.} Rb8 {Bringing the rook into play} 20. Re1 {lifiting the pin, but white remains very passive.} Bh6 21. Na3 Qh4 22. g3 Qg4 {The queen is now truely threatening to harass the white king and with the white queen completely unable to help, it is looking dangerous.} 23. Ng1 {covering f3} Qh5 {threatens g3 while keeping an eye on f3} 24. Rb1 {defending f3 with Kg2 doesn't look great either, as that would allow Rb2+. At least this might create some counter play for white if the black attack is not decisive.} Nxg3+ 25. Kg2 Nxe3+ 26. Kf2 Qxh2+ 27. Ke1 {? A rather strange move. taking on e3 wins back a piece and while white still has an uncomfortably placed king, black's attack will likely not pull through completely without the extra knight, which means black will eventually have to make some sort of retreating move with his rook, handing back the initiative to white. It still doesn't look great, but certainly better than being several pieces down.} Qxg1+ 28. Kd2 Qf2+ 29. Kc3 Ne2+ 30. Kd3 Nxf4+ 31. Kc3 Ned5+ 32. Qxd5 Nxd5+ {and white concedes.}
