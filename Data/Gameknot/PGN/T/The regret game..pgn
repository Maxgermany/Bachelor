1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {Classic Icelandig gambit position. } 5. Bd3 {EH??? Well, this is one of those bad moves that create the inmediate challenge to prove they are bad. If you fail, you'll feel as the stupidest of men... :-)} Bd6 {...and I wasn't able to find anything better, provided Qe7 is not such a threat now. } 6. Nf3 c6 {If I can't go on quickly, let set a defence against Nb5 so my queen is free to dominate the black squares with my bishop, taking advantage of the fact white's dsb is trapped. Like a manual... isn't it?} 7. O-O {Well, not quite so. For a start, white castled, and I didn't. White has no pawns in the center, but neither do I (thanks, c6!). Our pieces are passively developed, and my only possible break in is by pinning the Nf3 and threat Bxh2+. But I have clearly in mind that this will not lead to much more than that, and it won't suffice against white's counterattack in the center.} Qc7 8. Ne4 {I thought about a way to save the dsb: Bf4, and if g3, Bh6. But this is no victory, either. Of course, without my knight, my attack on the kingside loses steam. } Nxe4 {This exchange has another downside: it unravels white's bind of his pieces, freeing the dsb. The "horrible" Bd3 wansn't punished as it should be. So I felt pretty bad about the game.} 9. Bxe4 h6 {My weak point is e6. Can you see it? Against Ng5, I miss a tempo to defend the bishop with my rook, and I won't like to exchange it leaving a weak isolani in e6. I want it in g4, but not to be kicked with h3. The real unbalance in the position has still to be created, and the chance is, from my side, f5. But in order to play it, I have to castle and to defend e6. So I can't do it right now. Would it be possible to find another way to attack without playing f5? Maybe g5-g4...} 10. d4 {Of course white doesn't lose time. I can't avoid this move. } Bg4 {The same reason that I didn't do it before hold still now. But I felt I must do something, or just slowly die. Nd7 was good, of course, but it is on the agenda anyway. } 11. Qe2 {Uh oh. That shows that my previous one was a mistake. Because otherwise I could have confidently castled queenside now, without danger for my king. Now I have to prove it was not a mistake. } O-O {"I never thought about queenside castling" :-)} 12. g3 {White must have simply played h3, more in order not to lose the h pawns that to attack the black's lsb. Still I don't see the unbalance. } Nd7 {Now I want to put a rook on e8, of course. } 13. Bxh6 {White throws the game away, but I can understand his loss of nerves (even if we are still at move 13.!). He thought that my open king would be punished by the bishop that was a prisioner. But a sac like that needs accurate calculation, and probably some preparation, like Be3, Qd2. But white doesn't have time for it, because f5 is coming. I didn't play it before because of Qc4+, with some risks I wasn't able to calculate, but "smelled" in a bad way (as an Italian would say). So that's the reason - I guess - white opted for the sac. In similar positions, where the knight check allows the white queen to take the bishop, it would work. But not now. } gxh6 14. Bh7+ {This was the right sacrifice white should have played! Not that it would have worked: I'm not sure that white can even try a perpetual, but surely not more. But the "spirit" was this. Now, if KxB, nothing happens, since after Qe4+, the ominous f5 prevents black from any kind of danger. } Kh8 {And I just wanted to play with my enemy, showing-off my self-confidence. It was only a blitz, you know. Anyway, I was very curious about what my opponent would do. } 15. Qe4 {Oh, yes, he gave me the excuse for...} f5 {White's nemesis was called, and it came when it should, winning a tempo and the bishop in h2. If Bxf5, white cash a pawn for the bishop, but the queen can't penetrate. } 16. Qe3 {Now I can't play anumore. If Qxh6, I can be in danger, so let's play seriously. } Kxh7 17. Nh4 {Now the threat is Qd6 (MY nemesis! :-). } Rae8 {Too juicy not to play it. But it was not wise. It was necessary (Rf6 left the other rook unable to occupy e8), but allows...} 18. Qd3 {As you probably have already realized, black has just a single way to break into white's position (despite the material advantage): f4, planning a bishop's sac on g3 (once the white queen gets distracted from guarding it). Not an easy plan. } Kg7 {It may seem strange, but I thought this was the best place for my king, guarding g3 (but not really unpinning the pawn, because after f4, Qg6+). My Nd7 can move to f6, then to h4, to sac against g3... but still slow and not winning. But in fact, It would be much harder for me to win the game, dued to the open position of my king (all this because of not follow the common sense to play Nd7 at the right move in the opening... do you remember?). Let's see white's resource at work in this inferior position. } 19. d5 {White, for the second time, throws the game away (after a quite good position, being a piece and a pawn behind!). This move provides my knight the freedom to join the fry... and now white will feel the power of my extra piece.  But it was not so easy as it seemed. } Ne5 {As sound as it looks, this move is a mistake. Can you see why? } 20. Qc3 {Now, don't tell me this is not funny!! Maybe I should have played the knight to c4, instead, so to answer Bd5 if the queen checks. But I was obsecate with attack on the white king, so I overlooked the power of this move, because it threats f4. I thought that...} Kg8 {...was enough. But it isn't. Incredibly enough, white is returning me the same move I did to him before! I played horribly, and I couldn't find the right way to proceed, and now I am far from winning the game. } 21. f4 {I should never have left white do this move. I couldn't see all its implications, then. It is rare that a single move can accomplish so many tasks at the same time:  It seems to compell the knight to go to d7. If it does, five things happen: 1) allows the white knight to go to g6, 2) allows the queen to "look"   into the black nearby area, 3) avoids black to play Be4 "forever", 4) the knight deprives the second row of the queen's "look" 5) the black's f pawn can't advance anymore!!!! } Qb6+ {I had to improvise. The only conterside of f4 was that it leave white's king unshielded, too...} 22. Kh1 {Ok, but the knight's problem is still there. Attack, attack, attack... it's incredible: I am struggling to retaing my advantage. Can you believe my mistakes were so big? :-)} Bh3 {Please note: at a first sight, this doesn't work. White will take the knight and the bishop for a rook. But you have to analyze all the possible outcomes. It is not difficult: white can't allow a black bishop on e4, period.  And one must think about the "Re2 factor", once the column is open... a juicy position. But... a winning one? I think yes. Look for it and then turn the page...} 23. Rfg1 {White can't realize that he "can't allow a black queen on f2, specially if the knight exists and is able to go to g4 (now open. This, of course, was the bishop move's purpose)". The option was fxN, but then black has plenty of attack lines, staring with Bxe4. It has to be explored where does this lead. But black can choose BxR, and if exB, Qf2 - supporting the bishop. If white RxBf1 instead, again Bxe4 or Rxe4 are both good. White is suddenly in very serious danger, the tables turned again...} Ng4 {White should never have allowed this, in return, once more... it is the game leitmotiv! Now, white allowed a piece bind around his king that is very "puzzlish", isn't it? Can you see the finish?} 24. Raf1 {I hoped for this move! } Qf2 {White fell for the SMOTHERED mate (I remembered the name, at last!). But otherwise, I can imagine a lot of nice lines to mate. And maybe this can be a puzzle. Thank you for reading.  And, by the way: the "professor-like" mood is only for amusement. I am a teacher myself, and I take teaching very seriously. I wasn't "serious" in my annotation, and probably better players than me would assess the position or the move in a very different way and for better reason.  I mean: if you are a beginner, don't think that I am accurate. Dont' "trust" my point of view...  Note: I tried the position at move 24..., and, believe it of not, the way white escapes is Qd2, that generate a plethora of mate lines, but too many for the software. So I modified a little the position... here it is: http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=103301. It seems to "hold" and classify for a "not-too-easy easy one! :-)}
