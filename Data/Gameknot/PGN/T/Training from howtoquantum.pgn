1. e4 {My typical white opening move} c5 2. Bc4 {in my attemp to castle as Sr. Barbara told me within the first 4 moves, I move my bishop out} e6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. O-O {Castled by move 4} Nf6 5. Nc3 d5 {ok, so I took the pawn, I figured someone was gaining a piece, and while we are still tied, may as well be me, not a great move - I know but I wasn't sure what else to do } 6. exd5 exd5 7. Be2 {Getting out of dodge with my bishop in toe, thinking of moving pd2-d4 - it would keep things even you take with p-ec, I take w/ knight, you take with knight and I take knight w/ queen. } d4 8. Nb1 Be7 9. d3 {I was interested to see that you chose not to castle. I thought about moving my bishop e2 to c4, as you left a lovely gap. However, In thought better of it since my black bishop and b knight were still hemmed in. I will continue to develop before attacking} O-O 10. c3 {perhaps a risky move here, but I don't like when my opponent gets a pawn on 4d. I see we both have three pieces covering that spot but I am always willing to exchange pieces when tied and I am playing someone much better than me.} Re8 {I am suprised that you didn't take my pawn, so happily I will take yours, and I am up a piece} 11. cxd4 Nxd4 12. Be3 {continuing to develop } Nxe2+ {even exchange} 13. Qxe2 Bg4 14. Qc2 {perhaps I should have moved my h pawn to  row 3 to force your bishop to either attack or move (?), but I did not. I figure I have 2 pieces on your c pawn and can possibly gain a piece} Qd5 {foiled my plan to steal a piece, I see you have 2 pieces on my white knight} 15. Nc3 {dumb move here, I think...checking your queen is fruitless if you choose to attack my white knight, I probably should have moved to queen to e2 to add a layer of protection. }
