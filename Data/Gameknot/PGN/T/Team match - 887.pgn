1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Bc5 4. c3 {Spanish Game The Classical Variation. White's two main options after 3...Bc5 are 4. c3 and 4. O-O. Out of these two I'm opting for the slightly more flexible 4.O-O, which also rules out having to learn the unclear consequences of 4. c3 f5!?} Nge7 {Pasive move the best is 4...f5.  4. O-O then black has three main possibilities: 4...Nd4, 4...Nf6 and 4...Nge7. in the line 4.c3 the best is 4...f5!?} 5. O-O a6 6. Ba4 b5 7. Bc2 d5 8. d4 exd4 {8...dxe4 this move is the best black's} 9. Nxd4 O-O 10. Nxc6 Nxc6 11. exd5 Ne7 12. a4 {Good Move, if 12...bxa4 Then 13. Bxa4 and now is imposibility 13...Nxd4 then 14. Bc6!. And if 12...Nxd4 13. axb4!! } Bb7 13. axb5 axb5 14. Qd3 {King Black is vulnerable. } g6 {14...Ng6 is the best defence} 15. Rxa8 Qxa8 16. Bh6 {good move attack and desarrollo} Re8 17. Qxb5 Bxd5 {17...Bxd5?? The best is 17...Qa7 or 17...Bd6, Now the Black is lost.} 18. Qxc5 Bxg2 19. Qd4 {if 19...Nf5 Then 20.Bxf5 -}
