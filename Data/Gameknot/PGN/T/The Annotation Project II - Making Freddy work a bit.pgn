1. f4 {Greetings, this represents my 10th game against freddy (easy19) and his last game in this tourney.  While, as I expected, I did not win, I was able to make freddy work a bit in this game.   The action begins at move 8.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Ke8 9. Bf7+ {I did not want freddy to hide his King away.  I wanted it out in the open.  I was relatively certain he wouldn't allow a 3-fold repetition.} Kd7 10. Be6+ Kc6 11. Bxg4 Bg7 12. Ne6 Qg8 {All standard moves in this tourney.} 13. d4 exd3 e.p. 14. cxd3 h5 15. Bh3 {Rather than 15. Bh3, I think it may have been better to move Bf3+ (something I did in a later game with some success).  This could have been followed by 16. Bd5, threatening the Queen.} b6 16. Nc3 Kb7 {Black is moving his King to safety.  } 17. O-O {White does the same.} c5 18. Be3 Nc6 {Development on both sides.} 19. Bf2 {I think my thought here was to move Rfe1, but I'm not certain of this.} Rd8 20. Rad1 Rd6 21. Rfe1 Nd4 {Black begins to encroach into White's position but the Q and Ra1 are still constricted.  } 22. Ng5 Qf8 23. Nce4 {23. Nec4 threatens Rd6 and 'links' the Knights.} Rd8 {23. Rd8--Hooray! I drive freddy back.  (I take victories where I can).} 24. g3 {23. g3  I want to make room for my Bishop.} h4 25. Bg2 Kb8 {Black moves his King off the diagonal of the White Bishop.} 26. gxh4 Rd7 27. Bh3 Rc7 28. Kh1 {I wanted to move my King from a potential pin by Black's DSB.  I work hard to keep my B-pair as White in this tourney.} Qg8 29. b3 {29. b3 Just trying to keep Black's Queen constricted.} Nf5 {29. Nf5  I fully expect Black's next move to be 30. Bd4, thereby exchanging my DSB.  As I've noted, I work very hard to keep my B-pair when playing White.  Right now, there is no safe square for White's DSB after 30. Bd4} 30. Re2 {Therefore, I create a safe square.} Bd4 31. Be1 Qd5 {31. Qd5  White's N is pinned, Black is freeing up his pieces, and gray clouds are forming.} 32. Bg2 {White breaks the pin.} Ne3 {32. Ne3 - A variety of threats are present.  Black's N threatens Rd1 and Bg2.  } 33. Nc3 {Dually threatening Black's Queen.} Qd7 {Hooray!  Driving Freddy back.} 34. Rxe3 {34. Rxe3  I refuse to give up my B-pair as the two Bishops working together are key in this tourney.  If I move Rd1 to safety, I'm certain that Freddy will exchange the N for B.  If I move Bh3, Black simply moves Qc6+ and Rd1 falls as it is en prise.  So I give up the exchange.  Besides, I have another Rook.  How many rooks does one player need?} Bxe3 35. Nd5 {A happy little fork.} Bxf4 36. Nxf4 Qg4 {One good fork deserves another.} 37. Bf3 Qxf4 38. Bg3 {Chasing Black's Q away and pinning Rc7} Qf5 39. Be4 Qf6 40. Bg2 {Again, I don't take the Rook because I'm focused on keeping my B-pair and I feel the exchange works against me.  I'm hoping to bring my Rook into the game.} Kc8 41. Re1 Qc3 42. Ne6 {Making a play for the Rook.} Rd7 43. Bh3 Qxd3 {Black is picking off my pawns.  White is falling further behind in material but chances remain.} 44. Nf4 Qc2 45. Re2 Qd1+ 46. Re1 Qf3+ 47. Bg2 Qc3 {I felt like White has nice piece coordination at this point but I just can't find a way to mount an attack.} 48. Bh3 g5 49. Nd5 Qf3+ 50. Bg2 Qf7 {I've made it to 50 moves against freddy, easily my best game ever against him.  Oh, and "Hooray"--I send the Black Q away (temporarily).} 51. Rf1 Qg8 {Black's Q and R are where they were in the beginning stages of the game.} 52. Nc3 {52. Nc3.  I make this move as worry 52...Rxd5 53. Bxd5 Qxd5 leaving Q+R vs B+R.} gxh4 {uh oh.} 53. Be5 Rh5 {Black begins closing in.  Not sure what White could have done.} 54. Bf4 h3 55. Be4 Qf7 56. Rf3 Rf5 {At this point, I now it's over.  I don't see any way out for White.  I make my goal to get to 60 moves.} 57. Bxf5 {Thus ends my B-pair.} Qxf5 58. Ne2 Qe4 59. Ng1 Rd1 {I know mate is next so I moved the only piece I can.} 60. Bb8 Qxf3# {And so it ends.  During the middle game, I saw any number of possible ways for White to win if Black would only have made a small error.  Sadly, so far as I could discern, Black never did and White's attack never developed.  I really enjoyed this game and my sincere thanks to freddy for including me in this tourney.  I look forward to any insight/comments you all may have.}
