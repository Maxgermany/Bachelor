[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {I've always played at my best with e4. In serious play, I've yet to deviate from this. His preferred opening with White was a variation normally seen in Queen's Gambit Declined, where White plays d4, supports with e3, and then after playing c4, would push for c5 and immediately support with b4. I rarely encounter these games when Black, and I found it a bit difficult to play accurately with my camp so cramped up from the Queenside. I would pull through from the opening frequently, I'd even take an advantage for a good bit of time, but I got blindsided enough for him to come back and win the overall game both times.} e5 {As Black, he's an e5 player, something I've seen far too often and always enjoy fighting against.} 2. Nf3 {I play this, hoping he plays Nc6. Actually, I think he even did, our first match, where I was able to launch into a Ruy Lopez, but perhaps it was a different player, as his next move this match was what I remembered as his most astonishing characteristic...} d6 {d6. So we have ourselves a fan of the Philidor's Defense. I openly herald this opening as a passive opening for Black, as it immediately does White the favor of trapping the bishop on f8. It's rather easy, I find as White, to grab hold of the center almost right away and launch early attacks, as Bb4 is not a problem to worry about most of the match. However, he handles this defense well when in a Blitz match, and I'll show you how this happens.} 3. d4 {Main line for White. Philidor himself, when he invented this opening, believes that the opening is best played for Black to now attempt f5, with a counter-threat on e4 and a nice diagonal on the light bishop. Opening theorists have ultimately decided that should White play carefully, however, none of these lines result in equal positions, but rather an advantage for White as the color ultimately gets the first attack.} f6 {But, this is my opponent's twist on the opening. f6, blocking the knight. Black welcomes White to try to seize the light squares, while Black tries to capitalize on his own patience and the dark squares.} 4. Be3 {Black normally exchanges the pawn on d4, but I know that there will be a bishop on g4 eventually, and I'd rather my position be ready for the inevitable exchange about to head my way. Also, Nbd2 is a much stronger move now, a move we tried in one of our earlier games, but didn't quite get to this time around.} Ne7 {This was new for him, eyeing the f5 square, and bringing some fight to d5 as well.} 5. d5 {White could exchange, but with all of Black's developed pieces on dark squares, the weakness on e6 is something that he will have to deal with for much of the match. With such a strong outpost, Black must defend very carefully.} c6 {Black plays this, a surprisingly strong pawn while never quite making the overall intention of the move clear. If White takes the pawn, it's simply replaced by the b7 pawn, or either knight could grab it as well. I'd rather keep the outposts my pawn offers me, so...} 6. c4 {...I respond with this, forfeiting whatever power a minor piece on b5 could grant me, in exchange for my control of e6. White's plan here is immediately clear and obvious, though.} c5 {Black's, on the other hand, was not. If Black played c5 at once, then the outposting done against my dark bishop would have been much more obvious, and the idea to then capture en passant could have been far more justified on my end. Even so, with an extra pawn move spent, Black sacrifices tempo for discrepancy, forcing me to respond in a way that makes me question the tactical or strategic motivations behind his movements. The idea here still is not quite yet done, either...} 7. a4 {I don't want to give up my control of b5, so this was a plan to deter a6-b5 by Black. A preemptive move... possibly premature, given what Black does next.} Qa5+ {So, ultimately, the move 5 ...c6 provokes White into playing c4, strengthening this check, where I have to carefully consider where I want my pieces to go while he starts to exploit the dark squares he can pin on my queenside. Overall, I still like my position here, but the amount of counterplay Black has here is not to be taken lightly either.} 8. Bd2 {I had a bit of a think here, the choice of two developed or two non-developed pieces to pick to block the check. In the end, I decided I wanted him to spend more time moving his queen than making other decent developing moves.} Qb6 {Still, the greatest solution to this move here would probably involve me moving my bishop again to c3, which I really didn't want to waste time by doing. Black's moves seem rather predictable for now, but I'm not fully sure if I was playing the best way for White to have dealt with this line.} 9. b3 {Move the pawn, move the Queen, or move the Bishop. This move caused me the least amount of grief in my own mind, though it does become a weakness as the Queen is its only defender.} Bg4 {This move finally appears, developing a virtually useless bishop given my pieces occupy mostly the light squares. Black hardly has much other use for it at this time.} 10. Be2 {I play this, though I'm still not overly too sure about how I want my kingside to look once I've castled. I couldn't make up my mind between me wanting the knight on h4, or to just force the exchange by pushing h3. I was searching for the exact combination of moves, but...} Ng6 {...this threw a wrench into my thinking. I see Black gaining power with a knight on f4, while stopping my own Nh4. I didn't want to sacrifice my dark bishop should Black play ...Nf4 either, because I figured I had a better space advantage. Therefore, my dark bishop was stronger than his light bishop, which he was likely going to exchange in a moment.} 11. g3 {So I decide to weaken my light squares, daring Black to play ...Bh3, while preventing the Knight from grabbing those dark squares. } Be7 {Instead, he develops, enabling castling. Either he's fine with the position as is or he's waiting for more of an idea of what I'm planning. } 12. Bd3 {Looking back, I think I told myself that e4 was potentially in danger of an f5 push, and I wanted my pieces in place to defend such an idea after Black castles. A sound idea, but perhaps too soon...} Bxf3 {Black captures the knight, something I knew was going to happen eventually, and something I didn't mind having to retaliate using the queen.} 13. Qxf3 {Which I do, and this is practically forced.} Qxb3 {I did forget about how my Queen was busy defending two squares at once, and the unfortunate placement of my light bishop costed me a pawn.} 14. Ra3 {But even though I'm down for material, White has four very active pieces, whereas Black really only has his queen and knight. Dropping that pawn wasn't going to be the end of the world, because I was pretty sure I was ahead in development. I was working my way toward having about 7 and a half minutes at this point, so I was pretty comfortable with where I was.} Qb6 {The queen must retreat again, allowing me more tempo at the cost of my pawn.} 15. O-O {I finally take the chance to castle. I still wasn't too sure how I wanted to attack yet.} O-O {Whereas Black has a very clear target in mind: f5. It's a bit bizarre, because even though Philidor's defense isn't exactly among the list of Black's most successful defenses, here my opponent found himself having a very clear reach of the key square the former GM prided himself in regard to this opening. I may be ahead in development, but for me to use that development to form some sort of attack, I needed an idea on how to clear the air on Black's side of the board. And right now, that meant going on the defensive.} 16. a5 {Right here I decided that grabbing the extra pawn movement was probably going to help me out. It also prevents Black's a5, creating an outpost on b4 for a Queen or Rook to invade upon.} Qd8 {This was probably best for Black. Qc7 has a lot of blockage before h2 is reached on my side, but at least the Queen over here gives the bishop more power. However, Black has now moved the Queen five times, just to return her to her original position.} 17. Nc3 {I continue to develop, still looking for a way to push ahead.} Qd7 {Her sixth move, but the threats along this diagonal are serious and need to be addressed at once.} 18. g4 {This move made me cringe a little, putting the pawn directly in the path where the Black Queen could stare down my king. Even still, my position to me looked rather safe, for now, because the pawn is secure with all my efforts to control f5, but the player treading dangerously is definitely White at this point.} Nh4 {Black took a few moments before playing this move. I imagine he also was wondering where h5 would have brought him, but decided against it. Interestingly enough, looking at the line, I'm quite worried about ...h5, gxh5 Nh4, Qg3 f5. The e4 pawn is immediately threatened, and my Queen cannot defend f5 from h3 prior to that move because Black's Queen controlled that square. Nor can I take the knight, because after f5, the bishop guards h4, so I'd now need to debate how to deal with the rook on f8 coming into combat. It's a bit unclear (perhaps Bg5 would help me, trading off the bishops by then?), and while I think this move is okay, I'm left wondering where that alternative line could have taken us.} 19. Qg3 {A few moves prior to this one, I did tell myself that the queen would have been stronger on h3, attacking the knight while defending from f5, but at this point I just reacted after seeing the knight go here, knowing the Queen would need to come off of f3. I was a bit upset at just blundering away some tempo like that.} g5 {But here, Black chooses to defend the knight, and maybe with the added idea that my bishop can't reach h6 anymore? I'm not too sure if the only purpose of this move was to protect the knight or not.} 20. Qh3 {Either way, I was happy to get the chance to place my queen on the correct square again. Now Black can't push his way into my camp once more.} Na6 {I think he took some moments to think here as well. If I were Black, I think I'd consider asserting control over the f-file even more by playing Rf7, stacking the rooks down the column before White can do so himself, but I guess he decided he wanted to bring his queenside pieces into the game a bit more, eyeing Nb4 to kick the bishop, or even Nc7 to work the knight into the kingside via c7-e8-g7. I kinda feel like Black has a bit of an edge here now, but he wasn't too sure how to begin chiseling away at my development yet either.} 21. Bb1 {I can't let my bishop lose sights on e4-f5, so I retreat it while I can.} b6 {Next, he plays this. I think he was hoping to bait me. If I capture, then after axb6 axb6, his rook is protected, but mine is exposed after he moves the knight somewhere else. I'm forced to either move it and lose more tempo, or exchange, and Black's other rook recaptures onto an open file. } 22. Ne2 {I'm not going to waste time and accelerate Black's attack. Instead, I see that my knight can help drive into the fray via e2-g3-f5, potentially kicking the bishop or disrupting the King's defences on h6. Plus, I need not worry about the bishop on b1 needing a defender, as long as my other rook stays on the first rank.} Rab8 {I think here he decides that if I'm not going to capture, that he might as well take advantage of bxa5 with a rook on the mostly open b file. However, in doing so...} 23. axb6 {...in moving the Rook, the threats in capturing vanish completely. Without the rook on a8, the Knight doesn't allow any kind of discovered attack that could cause me too much discomfort.} Rxb6 {Meanwhile, this is forced, or else the knight on a6 is dropped.} 24. Ng3 {Black isn't threatening anything on the Queenside anymore, so I resume my plan to put my knight on the outpost on f5.} Rb2 {Black tries this, his timer was thinning down to about 3:00 left on the clock at this point, I believe. Still, I think I find this move inferior, as all it does is kick a bishop that isn't really doing anything. Better for Black could have been Rfb8, I think, as it forces me to reconsider the place of the far more important b1 Bishop. This just wastes Black's time.} 25. Bc3 {Now the Rook must retreat. I did also have 25. Bxg5, equalizing material after ...fxg5, Rxa6. At the time, I didn't see it, but even if I did, I'm not all that convinced that opening the f-file would be in my best interests. An alternative line I can see continuing this is ...Rb4, Bd3 Rb3, Rd1 Rb2, Nf5. But the thing is, White's Knight is now stuck being a defensive, though rather well guarded piece. But now my f2 pawn becomes horridly weak, and even though it's not immediately clear to me how Black could have exploited this (perhaps by stacking the rooks?) I think I'm right in not wanting to give the Black rook pair a new possible way of entering the game, and that the closing of the f-file is worth being down a pawn.} Rb6 {Anyway, I kicked the rook, and it goes here. Forced, or else the knight is dropped for nothing.} 26. Nf5 {Finally, my plan completes and my Knight assumes a completely offensive position from this square. I have several options, and I'm starting to like my position again. } Nxf5 {Black's knight, on the other hand, wasn't really doing anything on there anymore, and decides to trade off his bad knight for my good knight. I'm not sure if this was necessarily a thing to have to beat me to doing- say Black plays Rfb8 now, and White plays Nxh4, next comes gxh4, Qxh4 f5! Qh5 fxg4, and again I'm a pawn down, only now the only blockage on the kingside is Black's protected g4 pawn and my Queen is stranded without much way of getting her the help she needs.} 27. exf5 {But now, I dominate control over f5, and now Black's light squares around the King are dismal, without virtually any chance of fighting out of this now. My g4 pawn also strengthens as a result, no longer needing my queen confined to reach of it with the f5 pawn in the way. Having realized this, I started seeing ways of being able to move my pieces around to start focusing on working my way around Black's structure to make my way toward the king. My real only weakness here is f2 and c4, but if I'm careful, there are ways of bringing about a hopeful attack. Starting with the obvious- kicking my rook from a3 to h3 somehow.} Bd8 {My opponent began rapidly realizing he needed a new way to crash through my defenses, but at too much a cost to his clock. Hanging steadily around 2 minutes left, he begins maneuvering this bishop, and while it's not immediately clear his intentions, I was relieved by the passivity of this move. It was a sign that he needed to give me breathing room, for once.} 28. Qg3 {I remember being a bit unhappy about this being the second time the Queen came here, but regardless, the Queen needs to move off so that the h pawn can move forward.} Nb4 {Meanwhile, Black moves the knight here, either hoping I'd exchange, hoping that there's a place for his pawn, or the rook, or he's waiting to see what I'm up to next.} 29. h4 {Meanwhile, the h pawn comes out. My Queen can now take h2, controlling the h file while being able to spearhead an attack after a rook joins her on h3. My clock here is about 9:30 right now. Time looked rather well for me, it was certainly on my side, but the battle to pierce through against Black is still far from over.} Rf7 {My opponent had about 2:15 when he started here. Once he finally came up with this move, his clock fell down to about 0:40. He really needed to think about what other ground Black could advance upon to prevent White from coming in, and right now, I could tell he was really grasping at the best way to maintain his defenses while winning the overall game. Here, it looked like he was trying to figure out how to counterthreat me if I took the pawn on g5. Black's Queen could come around on b7 and help the Rook on b6, while the other Rook could find a home on g7, reaching g4, and wholly guarding h7. Black's defenses are rather solid- unfortunately, his clock was certainly against him more than anything else!} 30. Qh2 {I don't think my Queen has any business being on the 3rd rank anymore, so I move her where a Rook can come in front of her. I'm not in any hurry to resolve the pawn situation just yet.} gxh4 {But Black is. He eagerly grabs the pawn and wonders what I'm going to do about it.} 31. Bd2 {The bishop had to move off so that the Rook could come over to h3, but from there, what to do about the bishops? Originally my thought was to pair them between a1-b1, but I noticed that this would be potentially dangerous due to b1 being weak if Black were to stack rooks down the b file. So I move the bishop here, a new diagonal where it could move a bit more easily, but more importantly- a diagonal that could strike h6.} Rg7 {Meanwhile, Black hits the pawn here, forcing me to defend g4 once again.} 32. Qxh4 {So I'm forced to capture the pawn I was happy to ignore. I'm desperately grasping at how to go about getting my rook to h3 without my Queen having to be in front of it, wasting moves just to protect the g4 pawn.} Na6 {The knight retreats. I'm worrying at first, because I see Nc7-Ne8 again, but with the strong Black Rook occupying g7, I'm not entirely sure how hazardous this piece was actually going to be.} 33. Be4 {Meanwhile, I don't want to tie my other rook down on the back rank, so I move my other bishop to here, removing any chance of pushing e4 by Black, and defending b1 directly.} Nb8 {The knight continues its journey and I anxiously watch what Black is trying to get out of it.} 34. Re1 {I continue trying to move my other Rook somewhere it can help in the game. Kg2-Rh1 doesn't work because the g4 pawn is still pinned to the king and my Queen still leads the charge.} Rb2 {Meanwhile, Black kicks the bishop again for no real reason.} 35. Bc1 {I move the bishop here. I guess I told myself I wasn't too concerned if Black tried making a makeshift pin with Rb1 at the time, but looking at this again, I can see how such a move would have caused me grief, even if I were to try a move like f3 right afterwards.} Rb4 {Eyeing the c4 pawn.} 36. Ree3 {But I'm shortsighted, and I completely miss the other rook move. Whoops. In hindsight, this blunder actually drove me to lose a lot of my other pieces and to a pin, so I really wish I saw the other rook move when I had the chance to.} Rxc4 {So I drop another pawn again, and the Bishop on c1 comes under fire anyway.} 37. Rac3 {I defend, but at least my rooks are coordinated this time.} Rxe4 {Or, they were. Black is able to exploit the pin on g4 now, even at the cost of his rook.} 38. Rxe4 {Practically forced.} Qxf5 {White can't capture the Queen, the Rook is threatened to move, h5 is viable, and my pawn structure is falling apart. My next choices are going to be difficult ones. Black, meanwhile, has been able to take advantage of these mistakes. His clock has improved to about 2:00 now, and mine here was about 6:30 and falling.} 39. f3 {After quite a bit of time, I finally decide to give up the Rook-Queen team on the h file.} Ba5 {He hits the rook, hoping I entirely forget which piece it's guarding.} 40. Rc2 {Which I unfortunately do. The f3 pawn is left hanging, and my position is only worsening under my hasty command by the second.} Qxf3 {So the Queen eagerly grabs the pawn, and my rook is attacked once again.} 41. Rcc4 {I can't move the other rook, or else I'll lose g4 to Black, with check.} Qd1+ {Throwing in a check, hoping I miscalculate my movements a bit more.} 42. Kh2 {I break the pin, and if Black takes, I have the opportunity to reverse back onto the Black King, should Black play a bit carelessly. I'm not seeing any better alternative lines for White here.} Bd8 {Black retreats the bishop, preventing Qxf6.} 43. Re1 {Meanwhile, I thought Black had a discovered check with ...f5, threatening capturing the rook while hitting the Queen with the bishop. So I move the Rook down to here, hitting the queen. Naturally, because it's Blitz, I completely overlooked the fact that if Black had done this, Queen takes Bishop is check, and the Bishop had no defenders. Gosh, do I ever hate Blitz sometimes :D} Qxd5 {My four back pieces might be stronger than Black's, but I am down FIVE PAWNS against him. I have almost half the number of his pieces, and my situation is growing more increasingly desperate.} 44. Rc3 {I move my rook here, wanting to to find another way to coordinate my pieces, but I completely overlooked Black's next... and rather obvious... next move.} Ba5 {Horrid. No other word for this. Two skewered rooks, and neither piece is really defensible by this. Just, horrid. I had to take three minutes to see any kind of hopeful counter-attack, because I knew that any decision I make after this next one was only going to be difficult choices from here.} 45. Qxf6 {It was a tough choice, but I decide to try to counter-threat the only reason the Bishop was sitting on d8 in the first place. I brace to lose a major piece, but Black has a different idea in mind.} Qa2+ {I suppose, like when I hesitated in taking back the pawn, Black wanted to use this edge on the board to start moving his pieces toward my king, because even with the rather staggering advantage, there was a gap he still had to close.} 46. Kh3 {I'm still bracing to lose that Rook on c3 at this point.} Nc6 {Instead, he plays this, a staggering blunder. Again, to be fair, he has a rather short clock to deal with. I've taken probably most of my excess time, down to about 3 minutes at this point, and he was alive only due to the bonus 15 seconds per move. But in playing this move to close the gap on my king, he allowed me just about the only chance I was going to get to counter-attack on the Black King, to go all out on one final stand to rescue myself from this game.} 47. Rf1 {Bh6, Rf3, Rf1. Between all three of them, I felt this one gave me the greatest chances of escaping the most positions resulting in check. With Rf3, I was worried that a rook capture would be check, and with Bh6, I wasn't too entirely confident that the resulting checks after ...Rf7, Qg5+ Kh8 with the bishop on h6 would rescue me from the Queen and Bishop screaming down my King and Rooks. Looking at the Bh6 line now, it looks a little more promising, but I didn't have much time to entertain what would be my final big think for my only chance to turn the game around. } Rf7 {Anyway, his clock declined to under a minute again, and sees he's forced to move the rook here.} 48. Qg5+ {The queen steps off again, with check.} Rg7 {And the Rook blocks, and I see that Black's King is extremely confined to the corner now... which was fantastic, but my queen is on such a terrible diagonal that trying to fix her position basically means I lose the momentum to attack! } 49. Rcf3 {So after another 30 seconds to think over my counterplay, I decide to put all my eggs into one basket in one final push toward the king... even if it means losing the queen!} Rxg5 {Even though I knew it was temporary, seeing (-11) on that scoreboard was also cringe-inducing for me to have to look at while this game wore on.} 50. Rf3f8+ {Finally, some gleaming hope that a Queen sacrifice could save me...!} Kg7 {Forced.} 51. Bxg5 {So I win back some material for my Queen, but my accuracy must be spot on at this point.} Qb3+ {Black tries to exploit the position further, but his queen cannot lose control of f7.} 52. Rf1f3 {I'm still able to force the Queen to move to a square where she either can't check the King very easily, or where she can no longer defend the Black King from a rook on f7.} Qc4 {So he plays this. Probably the better idea, but Qd5 would have been stronger (if I blunder by moving the wrong Rook, Black has a mating attack with Qh1).} 53. Rf8f6 {But I'm not falling for that! I move here, confining the Black King still, and allowing my bishop to help with the attack. I was pretty sure that this was mating by this point.} Bd8 {The Bishop comes here. I liked ...Ne7 a bit more than this.} 54. Bh6+ {The bishop invades, and Black is finished.} Kh8 {Forced; Kg8, Rf8#.} 55. Rf6f8+ {Even though the move is strong enough to lead to a mate anyway.} Qg8 {Forced, but White must fight off the urge to capture...!!!} 56. Rf3f7 {The final move that traps the King, and the Queen can't capture either Rook, either.} Be7 {Alternative line: ...Bf6, Rxg8+ Kxg8, Rf8#.} 57. Bg7# {And here it is, a smothered Mate, with White being down the equal of two minor pieces! I really barely managed to pull the win out of this one, and I was sure I was had after that skewer on c3 and e1. This truly was a fight to the bitter end, a game I should not have won after some of the mistakes I had made. It was an interesting set of games none the less, and it should remind all players that no matter how down you are in material, the chance to come back and save the game could appear at any moment! I had made a great friend for blitzing, at least, and I had loads of fun with these games. Thanks for reading this annotation!}
