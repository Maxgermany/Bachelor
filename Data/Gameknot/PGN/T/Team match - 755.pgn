1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {I think that the side lines in sicilian opening are less good than the main lines.} Nc6 3. Nf3 h6 {a bad move. e6 is better. h6 is losing time in development and in the center.} 4. O-O e5 {d5 is very weak now.} 5. b3 {wants Bb2 and pressing e5.} Nf6 6. Qe1 {maybe Re1 was better.} Be7 7. Bb2 d6 8. Nc3 O-O 9. Nd5 {a good point to rule from.} Be6 10. Nxf6+ {?? what's the rush? white has a good center. playing d3 with Nd2 and f4 is a fine plan.} Bxf6 11. Bxe6 fxe6 {white lost the center to black. now black can play d5 and get 3 strong pawns in the middle of the board.} 12. c4 Nd4 {if white gives away key points - why not taking them?} 13. Nxd4 exd4 14. f4 d5 {breaking through in the center.} 15. e5 Be7 16. d3 {white locked the d file and hoping to get a king side game.} dxc4 17. bxc4 Qb6 18. Bc1 {the Bishop is no longer needed on b2.} Qc6 19. Qg3 {with the idea of f5 and Bxh6.} Rf5 {blocks the plan.} 20. Bd2 Raf8 21. Qg6 Qd7 22. g3 {better was 22. Rf3 and than 23. Raf1 and 24. Rg3.} Qe8 {? leaving a pawn on e6...} 23. Qxe6+ Kh8 24. Qd5 {now the white queen is in the middle of black teritory with a lot of attacking options.} b6 25. Qb7 Qg6 26. Qxa7 {another pawn...} Bh4 27. Rf3 Rxe5 28. Raf1 Rh5 {no real threat from black. white can slowly push black back and win due to material advantage.} 29. a4 Bd8 30. Qd7 Qf6 31. Re1 Qg6 32. Kg2 Rhf5 33. Re4 {white ha lota of space to move in   he has a pawn more than white.} Rf5f7 34. Qe6 Rf7f6 35. Qd5 Bc7 {prevents Re5.} 36. a5 Rf6f5 {trying to create a passed pawn.} 37. Qb7 Rf5f7 38. Qa6 Rf7f6 39. Qb5 bxa5 40. Qxc5 {too much pawn white has take. black is doomed.} Bb6 41. Qa3 Ra8 42. Qa4 h5 43. Be1 h4 44. Bf2 Qg4 45. h3 Qg6 46. g4 Qh7 {black is playing only with the queen while ahite has safes game. } 47. Re8+ Rf8 48. Rxf8+ Rxf8 49. Qc6 Rf6 50. Qe8+ Qg8 51. Qxg8+ {with a pawn up the black will want not to exchange pices.} Kxg8 52. Bxh4 Re6 53. Kf1 a4 54. Rf2 Re3 55. Ra2 Rxh3 56. Be7 Rxd3 57. c5 Bc7 58.
