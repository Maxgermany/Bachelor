[Opening "Sicilian (B70), dragon variation"]

1. e4 {Standard.} c5 {Sicilian. I love this defense!} 2. Nf3 {Still standard, white and black will both compete for the centre.} d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Dragon variation. I think the fianchettoed bishop and knight on f6 creates a strong defense for the black king.} 5. Nc3 g6 6. Bc4 {I like this move, getting the bishop into an attacking position.} Bg7 7. O-O O-O {Both sides have castled.} 8. Be3 Qc7 {Aiming the queen at h2.} 9. Rc1 e6 10. Qd2 Ng4 {! Threatening the bishop on e3, and also threatening d5!} 11. Bg5 {? A blunder that loses.} d5 {Tricky!! Now after Bb3, Qxh2#, and after Nf3 or g3, then dxc4. Hope you enjoyed the extremely short game.}
