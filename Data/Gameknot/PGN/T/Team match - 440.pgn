1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {knights before bishops... except i really want to keep this bishop on this diagonal, and black's knight on a5 ruins it.} Qf6 {hmm} 3. Nf3 Bc5 {f2 is a serious target} 4. Qe2 Nh6 {not certain what the plan is here for black} 5. h3 {..but i don't want Ng4} Nc6 6. a3 {trying this out.. nice preventative move for Nb4} Nd4 {this knight has to go} 7. Nxd4 exd4 8. d3 {i like this move.  black's bishop is going no where, and f7 is still a viable attacking point} O-O 9. Qh5 {i feel that this is a good square for my queen.  any thoughts?  attacking the bishop, and a g6 blunder allows Qxh6.  plus, nice parking spot until f7 is ready to go} d6 10. Bxh6 {open up the kings protection} gxh6 {i think this will be the weak point for black moving forward} 11. Nd2 Be6 12. O-O-O {taunting black's queen for a free pawn... i would love it to open up on the f file.} Bxc4 13. Nxc4 Qxf2 14. Qxh6 {if Qxg2, Rg1 and pin the queen.  also, i can move Qg5! and fork the bishop, but need that pawn on d6 gone} Qg3 15. h4 f5 16. e5 {i don't want black's rook active, so keeping that pawn on f5 on the f file is key.  also Qe6! is a good place, but I need black's queen off that diagonal because it's protecting the e5 and d6 squares which i intend to use.} dxe5 17. Rh3 Qxg2 {black is now in trouble} 18. Qe6+ Rf7 19. Nxe5 {i would black to take my rook} Raf8 20. Nxf7 Rxf7 21. Rhh1 Qf2 22. Rhg1+ Kf8 23. Rde1 Re7 {now it's a matting pattern from here on in.} 24. Qc8+ Kf7 25. Qg8+ Kf6 26. Qh8+ Kf7 27. Rg7+ Kf6 28. Rg2+ Kf7 29. Rxe7+ Kxe7 30. Qxh7+ Ke8 31. Rxf2 {i couldn't find a matting pattern, so i choose to take material.. black resigns here.   any feedback would be appreciated.}
