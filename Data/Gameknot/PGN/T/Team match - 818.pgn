[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {A quick London game} e6 {boomshakalaka aproaches this game with a strange opening, not sure if trying to throw me off or if he has a gameplan} 2. Nf3 {white develops as normal} c5 3. Bf4 h6 4. e3 g5 {white contines with normal opening as black releases strange pawn formation - bishop retreats here} 5. Bg3 a6 6. Bd3 Bg7 7. Nbd2 cxd4 {with more of a center threat this could of put a little pressure on white but as no imminent pressure all is ok } 8. exd4 g4 {pressure on the knight} 9. Ne5 {takes up postition he would normally like to develop to - lack of pawn support which needs to be addressed} Bxe5 {exchange taken white happy as plays pressure on blacks H rook} 10. Bxe5 Nf6 11. Ne4 {pressure on the defending knight, at worse black loses a rook & pawn for a knight or...} O-O {black feeling the pressure castles, with little pawn defence somewhat a foolish move and looses the game because of it} 12. Bxf6 {only option here for black is 12.....Qa5,13.Qxg4,Qf4 - this would prolong blacks life with a queen exchange but leave black in all sorts of problems} Qb6 {black looks to gain a free pawn wuth a fork on d4 & b2} 13. Qxg4+ {white puts queen into action against blacks weak defence} Kh7 {only play to go} 14. Qg7# {a quick london game!!}
