1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Somewhat old-fashioned, but it does open lines quickly. In this case, it is Black who exploits this!} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {The usual development... Black has a slight initiative.} 5. Bg5 {Pinning...} Be7 {...and unpinning.} 6. Nf5 {White presses the attack.} d5 {Black also plays aggressively.} 7. exd5 Ne5 {White is up a Pawn. He needs to consolidate his position and get his King to safety.} 8. Nxe7 {White attempts to simplify down.} Qxe7 {The natural recapture.} 9. Bxf6 {Expecting 9...PxB or 9...QxB. But instead...} Nf3# {...the game ends with a lightning-bolt!}
