[Opening "English opening (A10)"]

1. c4 {English opening.  Provides the queen access to the field, and all the major responses look favorable to white.} b6 2. e4 Bb7 {White does ok with Nc3 here.} 3. d3 {Pd3, however, seems to favor black in the database.} a5 {Pa5 is not in the database.  Black seems to do ok with Pe5 instead, but not many games with this variation are recorded in the database yet.} 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Bg5 Ng8 {Generally speaking returning a piece does not promote development.  Black would have been better off with Pe6 or Pe7 here, which lets the queen protect the knight.  Let white trade--white drops behind in development when the black queen advances into the field.} 6. Nf3 h6 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 g4 9. Be2 {Uh, no.  Nd2 or even better, Ne5.  Be2 allows PxNf3.} Bg7 {Ok, Ne5 is out, but Nd2 remains viable.} 10. Nh4 {...or Nh4.  Actually, this is probably better than Nd2.  I like it.  Black can play Pd6 to attack the knight with the queen--but with the bishop protecting it the attack is pretty weak.} e6 {Now the white h knight has nowhere to move, and the bishop is stuck protecting it, which prevents Pg3.  On the other hand--free pawn.  Bxg4 is looking great!} 11. Bxg4 {Yeehaw!} f5 {White has all kinds of power on f5.  Pawn, knight, bishop.  I recommend Pxf5.} 12. exf5 e5 {I'm getting a thrill thinking about Ng6.  Rh7 protects the black rook, followed by NxPe5.  White's black bishop protects the knight, and white gains yet another pawn point.} 13. O-O {This could have waited.  As Archduke_Piccolo noted in the comments, Bh5+ forces Ke7 or Kf8, either of which white replies with Ng6+ and then picks off Rh8.} Nf6 {Ng6 still looks good, but as AP notes Bh5+ remains perfectly viable.  NxB, QxN+ followed by Ke7 or Kf8--either of which Ng6+ and the black rook falls.} 14. Nd5 {Black has two pieces protecting that square.  White ends up losing a pawn point in this exchange.  Better would be Re1.  White might also think BxPe5.  NxBg4, QxN, BxB.  We see black comes out ahead of white seizes that wayward pawn.} Nxg4 {Wrong piece.  Although QxN, BxN, PxB leaves white's pawns doubled.} 15. Qxg4 c6 {QxB looks good here.  Black will have to move the rook, Rf8, and white can move in one of the knights.  Things begin looking grim for black.} 16. Ne3 {Oh no, QxB was SO much better.  That knight was fine where it was.  The bishop was free!} b5 {QxB!  QxB!} 17. cxb5 {No one ever listens to me.} cxb5 {That bishop isn't going to sit there forever.} 18. Qxg7 {Finally!  :)} Rf8 {Ok, white likes Ng6 here.  Though BxP isn't terrible.  Or QxP+.} 19. Qxe5+ {I liked the knight move best.  Rf7 black threatens the queen, but it is an empty threat because Qg8+ and black cannot move Ke7 while Ng6 was played.  Black interposes the rook, QxRf8#.  Game.  Set.  Match.  11 love.  Here Qe7, QxQ+, KxQ, Rfe1...  Fun, but now the game moves on past 20 moves.} Kf7 20. Qxb5 Bc8 {Oops.  Better would have been Qc7.  Now white can play Qd5+ and take Ra8.} 21. Qd5+ {Just like that.} Kg7 22. Be5+ {QxRa8 can wait.} Kh7 23. Ng6 {}
