1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {This as a bid to control the center.} d6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d3 {Already we can see that this game will hinge around the two e-pawns.} g5 {Confusing.  Black's motivation for this one is difficult to figure out.} 5. Bxg5 {Obvious to take the hanging pawn, and pin the knight to the queen.} Bg4 {An attack on the queen, simple enough.} 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxd8 Kxd8 {White chooses to trade queens, and eliminate the bishop, exploiting his better control of the center (especially the d5 square).} 8. Nf3 Bg7 {More bolstering the center.} 9. Bxf7 {Another pawn en prise, and it's taken.} Rf8 10. Bh5 {White's bishop is chased off the square but continues its attack.} c6 {A decent hope to attack the d5 square, but a knight lost.} 11. Bxg4 d5 {Having lost the knight, Black might as well press on.} 12. exd5 cxd5 13. Nxd5 {Even more stupid on Black's part.  White's control over the center is almost complete.} Nc6 14. c3 {Black is trying to hold onto a little bit of the center.  White intends to press on to victory.} e4 15. Ng5 {A good attack by Black, but White has spotted something.} exd3 16. Ne6+ {Black has missed the triple fork.} Kd7 17. Nxf8+ {Black moves badly to escape the check and is met with the loss of a rook and a double check.} Kd6 18. Nxh7 Kxd5 {White will take another pawn.  He has the kingside completely at his mercy and can deal with the loss of a knight.} 19. Kd2 {The king must get involved, as Black's is almost halfway across the board.} Ke4 20. Bf3+ {White will chase Black's king away.} Kf4 21. Bxc6 bxc6 22. Rhe1 {White, after eliminating some of Black's tools, is now ready for the last attack.} Bxc3+ 23. bxc3 {Why? Why? Why the useless sacrifice of his last minor piece?} Rh8 24. Nf6 Rxh2 {No choice.} 25. Re4+ {Note how White has used the black pawn as a piece of protection and is able to attack instead of run away from Black's rook.} Kf5 26. Ng4 {White will trade rooks.} Rxg2 27. Ne3+ {Now he WILL.} Kxe4 28. Nxg2 Kf3 29. Ne1+ Kxf2 30. Nxd3+ {Black's hope is gone.} Kf3 31. Re1 a5 32. Ne5+ Kf2 33. Nxc6 a4 34. Nd4 a3 35. c4 {Now simply to queen and win easily.} Kg3 36. c5 Kg4 37. c6 Kg5 38. c7 Kg4 39. c8=Q+ Kg5 40. Qf8 Kh4 41. Rg1 Kh3 42. Qh6# {White was already winning when his king moved to the d2 square, but the use of the pawn as a shield allowed him an easier and more simple win.}
