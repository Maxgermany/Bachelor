[Opening "Nimzo-Indian (E38), classical, 4...c5"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 {My opponent beat me 2 years ago with 2. e3 because he did know I didn't have any opening knowledge. Sure this has changed!} e6 3. Nc3 {But not too much... Oh sh*t, a Nimzo again. I always play the Queen's Indian to 1. d4 if I can and here 3. ... b6 would run into 3. e4! and all my QID theory is gone since I can't play standard QID plans.} Bb4 4. Qc2 c5 {My Nimzo knowledge is weak, so I started to rely on my "multipurpose tactic" here.  c5 (as later discovered by me) is totally playable. It frees c6 for the Knight, attacks d4 (if 5. dxc5 0-0 a3 Bxc5 7. Nf3 b6 8. Bf4 Bb7 is good for Black. Here the Nc3 is pinned so 5. d5 loses a pawn to 5 ... exd5 6. cxd5 Nxd5 however here is a possible line: 7. e4 Ne7 8. a3 Ba5 9. Be3 d6 10. Rd1 Qc7 11. Bf4 Bg4 12. Be2 Bxe2 13. Ngxe2 Nbc6 14. Bxd6 gives back the pawn.} 5. Nf3 {Another thing: always look what the opponent's move does and take advantage of its downsides if possible. The move Nc3 is playable, because there are still may transposition possibilities left but the main move here is  dxc5 according to the database.} Nc6 {If 5. ...cxd4 6. Nxd4 , and I eventually have to play Nc6, which White can take, simplifying the position, which I don't want, since the simpler the position, the lower the possibilities in it.  So Nc6, towards the center. Attacking d4 again, in fact threatening to capture it, and developing. My plan here was ready: to control the center with pieces and later push it in White's face. I always like to move pieces rather than pawns since I seek positions where I can develop pawns with tempo.} 6. e3 {As I said, look for the downside of enemy moves. This move is too passive since it does nothing than freeing 2 (!) more squares to a bishop and defending a pawn which is attacked by a PAWn so they can capture each other. Much better and more forcing here is 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bg5 (pinning a piece which controls some center squares and developing a piece).  I can play 6. ... d5 now, which is probably best, but that would lead to some simplifying for example: 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 0-0 9. Bd3 Qc7 10. 0-0 dxc4 11. Bxc4 e5 12. Bd3 Re8 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. dxe5 Qxe5.} Qb6 {(Out of book) Attacking d4 once more so that now White must do something about it. However now White has some edge with 7. a3 cxd4 8. exd4 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 solving the pin on c3, simplifying and soon he can play Rb1 attacking my Queen with tempo. That would be bad for me... but to my fortune, he also likes to play moves in the center... whatever move that is. It seems that he also don't know the Nimzo... but then why 3. Nc3?} 7. dxc5 Qxc5 {Whoops! I'm talking against myself... moving the queen twice and exposing her to a flank attack! Bxc5 is slightly better... but I don't like my mishop facing to a "stonewall" of f2-e3... and to think further, what he can achieve with the flank attack? Nothing I think. So I play to his tempos.} 8. Bd2 {Freeing the c3-Knight form the pin - but look, where the bishop is? And where can the other one go? Passive I think. Better was a3, forcing swap on c3.} d5 {I planned e5 later (since that square is now defended by the queen+knight by me) freeing the c8 bishop. But first I decided to get rid of the c4 pawn to create some threats of the undefended Queen: if now 9. cxd5 Nxd5 and the d5 Knight cannot be taken in view of the pin on c3 - and if he plays 10. e4 then simply 10. ... Nxc3 11. bxc3 and whoops, one more "pawn group", an isolated pawn - and the pin on c3 still stands.} 9. a3 {Finally forcing simlification. But the bishop already served its purpose and can be swapped now (in fact Bxc3 is the only move here, hehehe)} Bxc3 10. Qxc3 {In post mortem analysis my opponent said he feared from 10. Bxc3 cxd4 losing a pawn. But if so, then he can play 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Bxc4 regaining the pawn with advantage: 12. ... b5 13. Bd3 Qxc2 swapping Queens. (and entering a disadvantageous middlegame for me...)} O-O {Safety move - and threatening Ne4 with tempo.} 11. b4 {Flank attacks are best refuted by exploding the center, which I did here. I did not fear from such pawn pushes, since I already planned to move the Nc6 - after that the queenside would be just pawns facing each other.} Qd6 {Facing the center if he does not play c5...} 12. c5 {but he does.} Qc7 {The position is already equal.} 13. Bd3 e5 {Clearing the way to the c8 bishop and threatening a nice pawn fork on e4.} 14. Be2 {Losing tempo, but he feared from e4. 14. b5 e4 15. bxc6 exf3 16. gxf3 d4 17. exd4 Re8+ 18. Kf1 Bh3+ 19. Kg1 bxc6 is also bad for white - but still better than the text move.} Ne4 {Now I have the initiative! This move is aimed to swap the d2 bishop (i don't like when the eney has the bishop pair...)} 15. Qc2 {Defends the Bd2. He wanted to castle while having the Nf3 in place. I expected Qb2 anyway... but now I can play...} Bf5 {Threatening  Nxf2 gaining a pawn and some positional advantage and developing my last minor piece, connecting my rooks. The center is mine; it's a matter of time before I push it to his face!} 16. Bd3 {Preventhing the threat of Nxf2... but really? I expected 16. Nh4 Be6 15. Nf3 gaining a tempo.} Nxf2 {Losing all the hard-earned advantage... Now 17. Bxf5 Nxh1 18. Bxh7+ Kh8 19. Qf5 would be for White's advantage.} 17. Kxf2 {He wanted to keep the rook... Now Bxd3 18. Qxd3 e4 19. Qxd5 exf3 20. Qxf3 Ne5 21. Qg3 f5 22. Kg1 is equal... } e4 {I really thought I can win back a piece here. Only after making the move, I realyzed that if the Bishop moves then e4 is pinned to the f5 bishop so if exf3 then Qxf5. Well yeah, that was a HUGE error by me... but in real life chess there are some psychological reasons. I was facing a better, much older player, was extremely hungry and the my 10-man team was losing by 5-0 based on the already finished games. I stood up here knowing that I'm losing, I don't wanted my opponent to see my face...} 18. Be2 {And indeed he moves his bishop...to the ONLY place that he loses!!! Heaven and hell in one minute, isn't it?} exf3 19. Qxf5 fxe2 20. Kxe2 {Bc3 is worth considering since te pawn on e2 is already lost.} d4 {I only have some positional advantage here. His king was in danger and I wanted to attack him as fast as I can, laying some traps in the way. Here of course exd4 loses to Nxc4+ getting the Queen for nothing. However Rfe8 was better, planning Re6, but my plan was some kind of Rad8 - d3+ and trying to promote the pawn or just supporting the attack with it.} 21. Qf4 {Threatening Queen swap which would help him a lot.} Qd7 {"You won't get my Queen!" Supports d4 and moves away from the swap.} 22. Kf2 {Stepping away from a possible pin on the e-file. Good.} Rfe8 23. Rhe1 {Best, since exd4 would hand the file over to Black and d4 for the Knight.} Re6 {Ne5 threatening Nd3+ would have been better.In fact it would have won...} 24. Kg1 {He really thought (as he said) I will double on the e-file...} Rf6 {"No way, at first I wnat some more free space!" Attack the queen and gets half of the f-file. Also kingd of lock in the King. If for example 25. Qh4 then dxe3 and he must take with the bishop since it hangs.} 25. Qg3 {He decides to defend his weak point instead. Now I switched my plan of attacking the King instead of promoting the pawn. However 25. Qe4 d3 26. b5 Nd8 27. Bc3 Rg6 would have been equal... Sure he felt he has to defend and not counterattack first. This means, by bad but dangerous-looking moves, I gained the psychological advantage.} Re8 {"Developing" the last piece. See that Queenside? Nothing here, just and undeveloped rook and some pawns, pushed forward for nothing. With this move I planned dxe3 which he could take with only the bishop... I did not see 25. ... Rg6 26. Qf2 Ne5 27. exd4 Nd3!} 26. b5 {Want to chase away my Knight to a dominating square, leaving a hanging pawn? Well, here you go...} Ne5 {Attacks b5, threatens to enter d3 with tempo.} 27. exd4 Nf3+ {Whoops! Everyone at the post mortem analysis, including our 2300ish player from the first table, (I play at the 6th table) thought that this wins at least a piece. In fact we all overlooked 28. gxf3 Rg6 29. Rxe8+ Qxe8 30. Bg5!!! winning for White. At least this was frightening, so he decided to move away the King instead.} 28. Kh1 Nxe1 {Collecting my prize... He can only take with the Rook because if Bxe1 then Rf1 mate and taking with the Queen... Do I really need to explain that?} 29. Rxe1 Rxe1+ {CAn only take with teh Queen... and here comes a shot..} 30. Qxe1 Qxb5 {Taking a pawn, still defending from Qe8+ and threatening mate in 2 with Rf1+. I1m a little bit proud of this move, although I only seen it when I played Nf3+. Game is over now, however I was a litte bit exhausted and thought that I need to deal with the connected pawns. I was wrong...} 31. Kg1 {Defending f1.} Re6 {Defending e8 with tempo.} 32. Qf1 Qb2 {Attacking a3, d2 and d2 at the same time. Another move that I'm proud of. I feel kind of satisfaction when I play these kind of moves (although Qa4 was better...)} 33. Qf4 {Defending the guys on the d-file and creating an 1-move mate threat.} h6 {I refrained myself from g6 beccause he had a dark-square bishop, and also form f6 because if Qb8+Kf6 then the Queen is pinned to the defense of the b+pawn.} 34. d5 {Here Qb8+ Kh7 and then Qxa7 or simply Qf4 back is possible, but he also thought that his pawns are dangerous... He also really thought that I will play Re8 stopping Qb8+, but then why was h6? Istead I put it him in a more active place...} Re2 {...which wins quickly.} 35. Bc1 {He thought that I will, just retreat with my Queen... No way!} Re1+ {Mate in 3! (36. Qf1 Qd4+ 37. Be3 Qxe3+ 38. Kh1 Rxf1+) White gave up.  (As a side note, I would say thet here I was so excited about the win and exhausted and nervous that I only seen that he plays Kf2 (lol) and then I play Rxc5 (lol!!!) winning the c5-pawn (lol!!!)  Hope my annotations were correct, entertaining and first of all, useful. Feel free to comment it, I would really appreciate some feedback.}
