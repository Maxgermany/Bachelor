Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Ke8 9. Bxg4 {9. Bxg4 - I decide to get rid of the knight here.} Qd6 10. O-O {10. 0-0 - tucks Henry out of the way and protects my f pawn.} h6 11. Ne6 {11. Ne6 - trying to create a cramp.} h5 12. Bh3 {12. Bh3 - maintaining protection of the e6 knight.} Rh6 13. f5 g6 {13. ...... g6?? - a bad move, this will open the f file and I will make very good use of it to ensure I win the black dsb.} 14. fxg6 Rxg6 15. Rxf8+ {15. Rxf8+! - now!} Kd7 16. Rd8+ {16. Rd8+ - that rook espies bigger booty - the Wicked Witch of the West!} Kc6 17. Rxd6+ Kxd6 18. Nc3 {18. Nc3 - After dealing with the Wicked Witch I now consolidate and develop my second knight.  After black's next move, however, 18....... Ke5 I land a coup de grace with my horsie jumping on to c7.  The rook on a8 is toast and Scalawag waves that white flag!  I am now about to go away on holiday to sunny Cornwall for two weeks, returning on 28th August!  I will be back to annotate more games then but it is cheers and bye for now from me, Joanne.} Ke5 19. Nc7 {}
