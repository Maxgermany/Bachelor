1. e4 {I am 3 - 3 against Ethan and I challenged him to this tie breaker.  I regard him as better than me, though and felt I had gotten lucky so I play it safe, e4} e5 2. Bc4 {I had been getting hammered on this opening on OTB play by 1800's and above when I as playing as black, so I thought I would try it.  } Bc5 {He does the same,} 3. Nf3 {  so I just continue developing pieces.} Nc6 {he protects} 4. Nc3 {more development} d6 {threatens Bg4 pinning my knight.} 5. d3 {I don't seem to care  I want my knight at g5} Bg4 {he pins...  <sigh>} 6. Qe2 {still pinned but i don't want to stack my pawns} Nd4 {dammit.  what was I thinking?} 7. Qd1 {wasted 2 moves...} c6 {he doesn't make me stack!  i figured Nxf3. gxN messing up my O-O.  now I am confused so I just do h3.} 8. h3 {h3} Bxf3 {so now I am stacked and start thinking about O-O-O} 9. gxf3 {his knight did its job...and i feel violated} Qf6 {I really think this sucks.  so i figure if i am going to be down a pawn I am going to stack his.} 10. f4 {offering the stack} exf4 {he obliges.  I never worry about those pawns at this point because I have seen opponent's pawn out like that before work as a 'blocker' for me} 11. Na4 {I figure I will stack some of his... } f3 {I am still not worried about f3 for reasons previously stated} 12. Nxc5 {i follow through with my stacking idea} dxc5 {he follows through with my idea as well} 13. c3 {then moving him out I just don't like the knight in the middle of my business.   I want to castle O-O-O at some point} Ne6 {he retreats...} 14. Rg1 {It just seemed like a good thing to do if i am going O-O-O} h6 {I didn't understand that.  It seemd to give me a free move, one of the 2 I squandered earlier,  (besides  I have been burnt on that in OTB play)} 15. Be3 {so i get my bishop out of the way and attack the hanging pawn (assuming Bxe6 later)} b6 {he supports} 16. Qb3 {i clear the queen but decide b3 so I can have a couple of pieces on the knight,  I want to split that pawn at f7.} Ne7 {I thought he had better moves...  but I don't know what they were either ,  } 17. Rg3 {I decide to set my rooks up for stacking on g file} O-O {he looks like he has a real strong castle side,  all those pieces,  except if he moves the queen  i can Bxh6} 18. O-O-O {I follow through with O-O-O} Kh8 {i didn't understand the timing of this since his queen was still protecting h6  I figured Ng6 was better} 19. Rdg1 {i go ahead and load up.  His poor pawns are needing some back-up  I figure Rg8} Ng6 {I think about this a while.  it looks like I win a knight now.  Can a pawn really support two knights?} 20. Bxe6 {I take it and look at my stats,  of the 3 wins I averaged 57 moves against him,  In my 3 losses  I averaged 17.33 moves.  I think I am onto something...    ~~~ 2 days later~~~~  Ethan still hasn't moved.  I am thinking he will Nf4 ...but I am still waiting} Ne5 {He opts to save the knight and get a pawn (d3) for his efforts  If I go ahead and swap two rooks for the Queen and a pawn here, he ends up getting the pawn at d3 back and opens me up in the middle  ~  I don't like it  it just doesn't have a good 'feel' to it} 21. d4 {he may still put me in check,but I like the swap,  (or at this point i think it is a swap).  If i am ahead on points against a better player,  I want to get more material off the board.  I kind of like Bf5 here which would have still put pressure on his castle position.  but giving up my pawn in the middle like that just seemed 'wrong'} Nd3+ {he goes there anyway,  I don't understand the timing of this without the pawn there  } 22. Kd2 {i just attack with king} Nxf2 {he decides to get something for his effort} 23. Bxf2 {Taking pieces off the board is to my advatage at this point} fxe6 {This comes as no surprise.  I think about Rg6 for a while so I can get the pawn at e  but then I see....} 24. Rg3xg7 {Rxg7 !  this reall opens him up.  I am guessing he doesn't want to trade his queen for my two rooks.  and figure he will probably go Rg8 and force a swap of a couple of rooks.  I like swaping material when I am ahead.} cxd4 {hmm  I guess he is figured on getting a pawn back.  I could Bxd4 but I like R7g6 attacking his queen and threatening Rh6  .  he might take another pawn but I could take back with queen and after a queen swap still have the potential mate.} 25. Rg7g6 {Or at least I think so.....} dxc3+ {so he decides to put me in check and get even on material...  somehow I am not concerned.  there seems to be so many options here...} 26. Kc2 {I opt for Kc2 mostly because I don't like having it on the open d file but also,  if he takes b2  I get to swap queens and have a win being down material.  which is rare for me...} Qf4 {I guess he wanted to threaten something here.  but i can't handle the material equality anymore.} 27. Qxc3+ {i take the pawn and am thinking this game is pretty much mine.  I put in a series of conditional moves to keep things going leading to me sacrificing the queen for Checkmate.} e5 {conditional move.... (cm)} 28. Qxe5+ {cm} Qxe5 {cm} 29. Rxh6# {After i got the message that I won the game ,  I now wish I hadn't put in the conditional moves.  I don't win against someone this level often.  Work has been pretty slow so I have actually been thinking about my moves and playing with the 'analyze the board' feature.  I wonder how long it will be till i get back to my normal sporadic self, but tell wife that I want a chess book for Christmas..}
