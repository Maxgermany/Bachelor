1. d4 {I usually play 1.e4 because 2 pieces are released. But 1.d4 I play rarely because sometimes it can get boring but 1.d4 is what many grandmasters play. But it was worth a try!} e6 {not very common against  1.d4.  I tried to get him into the French defence by doing.....} 2. e4 {This.  I was expecting  the French  ( 2. d5) the most common move,  but I was shocked to see.....} d6 {2.d6?  this move deserves a question mark it really does, because it is a dull move,  far too  passive and both bishops are shut in.} 3. Be3 {getting out my Queenside pieces.} Nf6 { !   Developing a piece with a threat  (4.Nxe4)  good move!} 4. Nc3 {! developing a piece too and at the same time covering the e4 pawn!} c6 {?   Prevents the b8 knight from coming to c6.} 5. f4 {Getting my King-side attack rolling!} Be7 {  Preparing to 0-0.} 6. Nf3 {?    Developing a piece but allows  6. Ng4} O-O {?  Yes, Yes, Yes  Dellerth had castled on the same side as my attack was  going to   take place. I think Dellerth  should have delayed castleing or maybe not to castle at all.    } 7. Qd2 {    Getting ready to 0-0-0 and also to have the Queen and bishop lined up on      the diagonal. Not blocking my f1 bishop,  which was my very powerful weapon    later on!} b5 {!    A very good move. That made me not wanting to 0-0-0 at any point. Dellerth was also threatning 8. b4  9. Ne2 and Nxe4  winning  a pawn      } 8. e5 {!     Threatning to swap off.....} dxe5 {  Like that!} 9. fxe5 {     So I could open up the Queen and bishop diagonal and an Ideal f- file for my       rook, but I did not use it.} Nd5 {   The best place to retreat, also threatning  10. Bb4!} 10. Nxd5 {  I did not like the look of the pin (10.Bb4)} Qxd5 {?    More solid would have been  exd5 also letting out the c8 bishop!} 11. Bd3 {!   Placeing my light squared bishop on the all important diagonal that eyes on        black's weak point ( h7) setting up the classic bishop sacrifice!!!} a5 {?     no good as I was not thinking about castleing anywhere. Instead I        setting up the Classic bishop sacrifice. Hope lied  within something such as       11. Nd7 followed by 12. f5 for black.} 12. h4 {!!     The point of this move was when I did do the bishop sacrifice. Kxh7        Ng5 !! If black would take the knight with the bishop. pxh5  opens up the       h- file with a deadly attack which comes with mate!      But the sacrifice is not quite ready yet.  } b4 {?         Black should have worred about his king here instead of doing stuff on              the Queen-side that did not even bother me. It was not too late at this                point to have tried 12. Nd7  followed by 13. f5.           } 13. Qe2 {  Now after the bishop sacrifice and Ng5   the queen will have access to h5!} Nd7 {??     TOO LATE!   13. f5 or 13. g6 where the only two moves.} 14. Bxh7+ {!!    Here comes the beautiful bishop sacrifice!} Kxh7 {        A forced move......} 15. Ng5+ {    If   15.Bxg5  16. pxg5   Kg6   17. Qh5   Kf5   18. g4 checkmate         If  16. Kh6  17. Nxe6    discovery check by the bishop  17. Kh7  18. Nxf8       gives white a won game!} Kg8 { } 16. Qh5 { Threatning  17. Qh7  checkmate.} Bxg5 17. hxg5 {  opens up h-file  and threatning  Qh7 or Qh8 checkmate!} f6 {    The king tries to run away.....} 18. g6 {     But it does not work!   And now 19.Qh8  checkmate is unstopable!} Nc5 {  Black's position is just hopeless.} 19. Qh8# { Checkmate!   What a wonderful sacrifice and what a wonderful game.      I would like to thank  Dellerth  for the absolutly brilliant game we had!}
