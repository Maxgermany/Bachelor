1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This game was another nailbiter.  I looked destined for a 15-16 point loss when I found a match-winning trump card.  My a pawn.  I had the black pieces and I went for a kingside attack in the late middlegame which failed leaving dmaestro with a dangerous passed h pawn.  This gave Glenda a new role - a blocker!  She did that really well but before she was reduced to this ultra-mundane assignment she managed to remove white's a2 pawn leaving my a pawn passed.  It was a real worry that white's dsb controlled the a1-h8 diagonal, protecting his own passer and preventing mine from queening.  But somehow the game turned suddenly in my favour.  Anyway, we pick up the action on move 9 where I choose to move Glenda to e8 (recommended by Master Freddy), white replies with 10. Ne6.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 Qe8 10. Ne6 Na6 {10. ...... Na6 - development.} 11. O-O Nc7 {11. ...... Nc7 - asks the e6 knight a question.} 12. f5 {12. f5 - answer - he backs it up with a pawn.} g6 13. Nc3 {13. Nc3 - development.} gxf5 14. Bxf5 {14. Bxf5 - pawn trade.} Nxe6 15. Bxe6 {15. Bxe6 - knight trade.} Bg7 16. Bd5+ Kc7 {16. ...... Kc7 - a necessary retreat for Henry.} 17. Bxe4 Bxc3 18. bxc3 {18. bxc3 - B for N trade and now white's pawn structure is compromised.  However, white has the bishop pair and they could become a real swine for me pore ole 'enry!} Rf8 19. Bf3 {19. Bf3 - declining a rook swap.} Qa4 {19. ...... Qa4 - Glenda has had enough of sitting pretty on e8, so she gets on her broomstick and flies to white's queenside to see if she can boil up a cauldron of trouble for white there.  From a4 she also has h4 in her radar.} 20. Rb1 Rab8 {20. ....... Rab8 - defending b7 pawn.} 21. Rb2 b6 22. d3 Rf7 23. c4 {23. c4 - blocks Glenda's path to h4.  Aha, says Glenda, I think I had better go back to e8 and try and create a disturbance in front of that white king!} Qe8 24. Bg5 Qg8 {24. ...... Qg8 - Glenda steers her broomstick to g8 and waves her wand at the enemy dsb who moves out of the way to h4.} 25. Bh4 Rbf8 26. Bg3+ Kd8 {26. ...... Kd8 - I try to amass my heavies in front of the WK but Henry must now find a safe haven, I just hope that d8 will do.} 27. Re1 Rf7xf3 {27. ...... Rxf3 - I sacrifice my rook for white's lsb plus a pawn to break up the bishop pair.  There are still 2 white rooks plus the dsb to contend with though.} 28. gxf3 Rxf3 29. Kg2 Rf5 {29. ..... Rf5 - a retreat but trying to keep some pressure on the WK.} 30. Rbb1 h5 {30. ...... h5 - heading for h4 and to try to win the white dsb.} 31. Re4 Qg5 32. Rbe1 h4 {32. ...... h4? - this sacrifice does not work and dmaestro gives me a headache for many moves to come.} 33. Rxh4 Qd2+ 34. Kh3 Rf3 {34. ..... Rf3 - trying to maintain a pin on white's dsb.} 35. Rhe4 Rf7 {35. ........ Rf7 - defends e7 pawn.} 36. Re1e2 Rh7+ 37. Kg4 Qa5 {35. ....... Qa5 - Glenda decides to have another pop at dmaestro's queenside pawns.} 38. Re4xe7 Rxe7 39. Bh4 Qxa2 {39. ........ Qxa2 - my rook on e7 is pinned and lost next move so Glenda decides to take off the white isolated a pawn.  It turned out to be a match-winning decision.} 40. Bxe7+ Kc8 {40. ....... Kc8 - Henry decides to stay on the queenside.  Glenda will cover the kingside.} 41. h4 {41. h4 - dmaestro pushes his h passer, thankfully this is as far as he gets!} Qb2 42. Bg5 Qd4+ {42. ....... Qd4+ - Glenda finds a tempo-gaining check to get her over to the kingside.} 43. Bf4 Qg1+ 44. Kf5 Qd1 {44. ....... Qd1 - hassling the WR.} 45. Rh2 Qh5+ 46. Bg5 a5 {46. ..... a5 - Glenda is now given here most menial role.  Not only has she been a defender, she is now a blocker!  However, I now decide it is time to push my a pawn.  Luckily it is supported by a fellow foot soldier.} 47. Rd2 Kb7 {47. ...... Kb7 - it took me nearly 3 days to come up with some plan and I decided that Henry should try to shepherd my a pawn to Glendadom and at least make dmaestro give up his dsb in so doing.  Well, no harm in trying ......} 48. Kf4 Kc6 49. Rh2 a4 {49. ...... a4 - in for a penny, in for a pound, at least I now have the full 7 days on my clock!} 50. Ke3 b5 {50. ........ b5 - backs up the a4 pawn.  Yup, a pawn trade comes up but now Henry can support the a passer much more easily.  Dmaestro can curse his c2 pawn for it has been an effective screen!  I bet dmaestro wished that his rook could capture his own pawn so that he could stop Henry and the a pawn dead in their tracks.} 51. cxb5+ Kxb5 52. c3 a3 {52. ...... a3 - my pawn is only 2 squares away from Glendadom and Henry sees a way to support that pawn.  It seems that white must give up his dsb to stop this.  White sees this and waves the white flag giving me my highest rating so far.  1798, so near and yet so far to that 1800 milestone!  I now have 8 points out of 11 games so after a shaky start, so far so good.}
