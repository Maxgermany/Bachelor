[Opening "English (A36), symmetrical variation"]

1. c4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 {i don't usually see the symmetrical with the english} 3. g3 d6 4. Bg2 Bd7 {and it never lasts} 5. Nf3 a6 6. O-O {i like the way it started: i am well protected, and i can concentrate on attack. } Qc7 {I am not sure this is very comfortable because the queen is expose to a Knight attack. But, till now, it is not very important, though i started to think about potential traps on d5} 7. d3 e6 8. e4 h6 9. d4 {my goal was to push on this potential trap.} g5 {that is interesting, because black does not hesitate to attack, though the king is clearly not protected and two pieces are still waiting to get out. } 10. d5 {well, then...} Ne5 11. Nxe5 dxe5 {the black position seems inadequate, though it is hard to find a real and concrete weakness. i have considered on sacrificing on g5 sometime, but 1) i was lacking of material; 2) it could have opened my own king side; 3) I had a better plan on queen side} 12. Be3 Bd6 13. a3 O-O-O {this is very dangerous, now, because all my pieces converges there. now my plan on queen side has much more sense} 14. Qe2 f5 {who will be first? My d5 is still in my mind: in two moves from now} 15. dxe6 {too late for the black attack} Bxe6 16. exf5 Bxf5 {so now my d5-knight is open. Bf7 was not better, though, for the loss of a pawn, at least it kept some activity} 17. Nd5 Qg7 {and everything seems open for my bishops and my precious knight. Was there a better place for the queen?} 18. b4 {let's open all of this...} cxb4 19. axb4 {2 valorous pawns, a knight, two bishops and my queen are on the verge to attack an exposed king...} Ne7 {necessary. But in the mean time blocking the queen from king side} 20. Nb6+ {i want to keep him, so i launch him on the brink.} Kb8 {Kc7 was a mess because of c5, losing a bishop.} 21. c5 {this is just too good to be true: the black queen is out and the bishops diagonals are opening everywhere} Bc7 22. Rxa6 {who needs a rook?} Bxb6 {if bxa, then it is checkmate in very few moves. so, this was the only possible move. My knight has been brave and fell for the good of every one} 23. Rxb6 {i wonder, maybe i had to sacrifice the rook and take with the pawn... Not sure.} e4 {blocking my diagonal, good move, i think, but will not stop me from my attack} 24. Qa6 {but, hey! who is there?} Nc8 {threatening the draw by three-fold repetition. Actually, i previewed this move, but didn't know exactly if my attack was still possible. Though i refused to stop it} 25. Rb5 Na7 26. Rb6 Nc8 {hm, i had to chose where to lose the rook} 27. Ra1 Nxb6 {and i can't take it back with the queen, or i lose the other rook} 28. Qa7+ {check before taking the knight} Kc8 {of course not Kc7, because it would give me a tempo when i take the knight... But mostly, it gives me... the queen: if Kc7, then Qxb6+ and whatever the king does the queen will fall after two or three moves.} 29. cxb6 {prohibiting Kd7, giving me another tempo... and the queen} Qe5 {interesting, but though...} 30. Rc1+ {yep, that move is the best one and at least regain the loss. But at least it saved the queen.} Kd7 {one and only} 31. Qxb7+ {equal in term of material} Ke8 {was Ke6 better?} 32. Qc6+ {allowing passage to my pawns... and now i have to make them protect each other.} Kf7 33. Qc7+ {this is it!} Qxc7 {i wonder if Qe7 was maybe better} 34. bxc7 {because i don't see how to stop them now} Rd7 {it is almost over now} 35. b5 Rd5 36. b6 Rb5 {this is too kind: my light bishop can now take place in game} 37. Bf1 Rb4 38. Ba6 {announcing b7} Ra8 39. b7 {only move: Rxb7... So black resigned}
