1. e4 {This is my sixth annotation. e4 is the common opening move.Opens up a lot of opportunities for the main pieces to break free.} e6 {e6 - a new defence to me. Unfortunately I am unsure of what it is called.} 2. e5 {So I try something new myself.} a6 {An interesting move as it benefits none of black's pieces.} 3. d4 {d4 - defending e5.} b5 {Another pawn move. No major pieces have come into play yet.} 4. c3 {Here too, I am not benefiting any pieces and restraining my knight.} Bb7 {The bishop comes out for the side attack.} 5. Nf3 {The knight comes out for the block.} h6 {Another questionable move.} 6. Bd3 {Not allowing the rook to come out.} g5 {Comes out to attack the knight with g5.} 7. g4 {Risky move, leaving the queen to protect the knight.} f5 {Trying to make sure I can't escape and closing the knight in.} 8. gxf5 g4 {There. I accidentally move the knight which was blocking my rook.} 9. Ng1 Bxh1 10. Qxg4 {Black's fatal mistakes.} h5 11. Qg6+ {Black's king is stuck after some realisation.} Ke7 {The finishing blows.} 12. Bg5+ Nf6 13. Bxf6# {That's it! Thanks to monty66 for a great game.}
