1. d4 {Another game I lose but this time there is an interesting sacrifice that I feel must be taken into account.  At the time I couldn't figure out how to break it and I still have trouble with it.  I feel that it shouldn't be sound... I'd like outside opinion.  This game starts out with the king's Indian Defense.  Fairly interesting game I make one big error that allows black to break the bind making me with a bad bishop vs good knight.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Nc2 Qe7 12. f3 {I set up a bind which I cannot remember the name of at this time.} Nb6 13. Qd2 Re8 14. Rac1 {Getting my rook off the long diagonal...

Bf1 {gets out of the line of fire of f5.} b6 30. a4 a5 31. Kh1 Rh5 32. h3 Rhe5 33. Kh2 {here is where I make my critical error thus allowing white to break open my bind.} d5 34. cxd5 Rxd5+ 35.

Kg1 Kh4 49. Qd7 {maybe Bg8?} h5 50. Bf7 Qxe4 {Black defends the pawn} 51. Qd2 {possible an error gives up the pawn.} Kxh3 52. Qh2+ Kg4 53. Qd6 Qd4+ {forces a trade of queens.} 54. Qxd4+ cxd4 55. Bxg6 f5 {f5! cuts off my bishop form the game.} 56. Be8 Kf4 {Black gives up a pawn for time as black will get to the pawns on the queen side.} 57. Bxh5 Ke3 58. Kf1 Kd2 59. Kf2 Kc2 60. Bg6 Kxb3 {My opponent though Bf7+ was best here I figured I'd gain another pawn here.} 61. Bxf5 Kxa4 62. Ke2 Kb4 63. Kd2 {Kd3 might be stronger.} a4 64. Kc2 b5 65. Bd3 {Be6 may be slightly better.} Kc5 66. Kb2 b4 67. Be2 {Keeping the king away form c4.} Kd5 68. Bb5 a3+ 69. Kb3 {Kb3! stops the pawns from moving for the moment.} Ke4 70. Bc6+ Ke3 71. Bd5 d3 72.
