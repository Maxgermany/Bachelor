[Opening "King's Indian (E92), Gligoric-Taimanov system"]

1. d4 {This is one of those heavily-analyzed King's Indian Defense variations.  It is called the Gligoric-Taimanov system in ECO E92.  It often produces very dynamic games with chances for both sides. And the field can shift from queen-side to king-side or can exist on both sides simultaneously.  This game shows how a heavy queen-side attack can shift suddenly to the king-side.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 Nc6 10. d5 Ne7 11. Nd2 Nh6 12. f3 f5 13. Bf2 c5 14. Rb1 {This game is following Matej Sebenic v. Franc Ravnik (Kranj op. 1, 5/7/2004).  Sebenic won that game.} f4 {Ravnik played 14...Bd7 to assist Black's king-side advance. } 15. b4 cxb4 16. Rxb4 g5 17. h3 {The computer analysis says that direct queen-side action starting with 17. c5 is best.} b6 18. O-O Ng6 19. a4 {I am planning a queen-side breakthrough with a5 at some point} Ba6 20. Nb5 {Maybe 20. Qa1 is better, as the computer suggests.  But I am looking for ways to gain the exchange with a later Nxa7 and Bxb6, if black allows it. } Nf7 21. Qb3 {I am planning 22. Nxa7 Rxa7 23. Bxb6 Qd7 24. Bxa7 Qxa7+ 25. Rb6 Rb8 26. Rb1 with a lot of pressure.  But then I saw a better move to crack open the queen-side. } h5 22. a5 bxa5 23. Ra4 Bxb5 24. cxb5 {The two bishops now spring to life.} Qc7 25. Rc4 {The computer much prefers that white pile up on the doubled a-pawns with 25. Rfa1.  But I think seizing the c-file puts the same cramp on black's queen side and gives me a way to launch an attack on the other wing, too.} Qb7 26. Rfc1 Rfd8 {He correctly sees the weakness of the d-pawn and my chance to break through in the center.  But the computer prefers 26...Bf6. } 27. Rc4c7 Qb8 28. Qa4 Nf8 29. Qxa5 Rd7 30. Rc1c6 Bf6 31. Rxd7 Nxd7 32. Nc4 {This is the main reason I played 30. R1c6.  It draws a bead on the d-pawn.} Bd8 33. Qa3 {Opening up the chance for a bishop sacrifice to increase the pressure on the d-pawn.  A break through in the center will soon expose the black king  } Qxb5 34. Nxd6 {The computer prefers 34. Rxd6 Nxd6 35. Qxd6 Nf8 36. Qxe5 Qd7 37. d6.  But I could only think about a direct assault on the black king now.  Funny how a fixation like that can change the course of a game so much.} Qxe2 35. Nxf7 Kxf7 36. Qd6 Nf6 {In most variations in the computer analysis, 36....Nf8 seems to cover the attack squares that the white queen has.  And the knight being on f6 now sets up a pretty combination.} 37. Qxe5 Qd1+ {With this move, black sets up a sequence that can force a perpetual check or, at worst, a pin on the bishop that keeps the bishop tied to the first rank, all to prevent the perpetual check.  So if it succeeds, it can badly compromise the coming attack on black's king.  From now on, I must keep my bishop free to participate in the coming attack.  } 38. Kh2 a5 39. Bd4 {This sets up the combination which leads to checkmate.  It also entices his queen to play for the perpetual check on the squares e1 and f3.} Qe1 {It seems the only way to stop the coming attack is for him to sacrifice his queen for the bishop with 39...Qxd4. } 40. Rxf6+ {An 11-move (or shorter) checkmate now commences.  There are some tricks in the coming sequence of checks that are very instructive.} Bxf6 41. Qxf6+ Ke8 42. Qg6+ {Sloppy play by me (with his king escaping from the checks for just one move) is enough for him to tie up the bishop on g1, starting with ....Qf3+ and then ....Qe1+.  So every check must count now, successfully to drive his king to the "coffin corner." The purpose of 42. Qg6+ is to drive his king to the queen-side for an easy box-in type of mate.} Kd7 {If 42...Kd8, then 43. Bb6+ Ke7 44. Bc5+ Kd8 45. Qf6+, etc.  Yes, I could instead play 43. Qc6+ and pick up his rook, but the mate sequence then disappears and a much longer game ensues.} 43. Qe6+ Kc7 44. Bb6+ Kb8 45. Qd6+ {The step by step pattern with the queen fencing in the king continues.  As long as the bishop stays on the g1-a7 diagonal for most of this process, it will be effective in the fencing process too. } Kb7 46. Qc6+ {Not 46. Qc7+, because the checks would have to stop after 46....Ka6.  Also note that the exposed white d-pawn is instrumental in giving the white queen the base of operations for this attack.} Ka6 47.
