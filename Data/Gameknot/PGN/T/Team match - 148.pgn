1. f4 {Bird's Opening. Not very common at all.} d5 {Typical.} 2. Nf3 {Fairly strong centre for white, especially on e4.} Bg4 {Pinned.} 3. e4 {Blunder. I get a knight and a pawn.} dxe4 {Expected.} 4. Bb5+ {Another mistake. Gives me a free move.} c6 {Expected.} 5. h3 exf3 6. hxg4 cxb5 7. gxf3 {Bloodshed over.} Nc6 {OK?} 8. Rh4 {Why is he developing rook so early?} e5 {Discovered attack under the guise of centre control.} 9. fxe5 {?? Loses a rook.} Qxh4+ {Check. Pretty much half of white's army is gone.} 10. Ke2 Nd4+ {Check.} 11. Kd3 {Threatening knight.} O-O-O {Castling to defend knight.} 12. c3 {Threatened.} Nb3+ {Discovered attack gains me a rook.} 13. Kc2 {Blunder. Mate in one.} Nxa1# {Checkmate!
