1. Na3 {Hi everyone!  I have been given a Master Lesson here in how to mount a successful mating attack on a kingside castled position.  Now Master Freddy seems to have a standard Modus Operandii here.  In the opening he tends to give minions like me a head start with some obscure and beginner type anti-developing moves allowing me a free hand.  He then proceeds to undermine it.  In some of my past annotations against him he has hit me with a pawn push down the h or a column.  Here he strikes by forcing an exchange of knights which busts up my queenside pawn structure laying the foundations for trouble for me later on.  In order to avoid going a pawn down I end up having to let Henry be taken to Freddy's castle yet again.  How does this happen?  Well read on.  Freddy kicks off with 1. Na3, an opening called the Sodium Attack because of the Chemistry Symbol Na (meaning sodium).  Tactical Abyss, another strong Master tried it on me and he won.} Nf6 2. Nb1 {2. Nb1 - now he undevelops his knight.  I ignore the World DB's suggestion of Ng8 and decide on normal, sensible, development with Nf6 followed by e5.} e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. d4 {4. d4 - now comes the undermining - firstly d4 to make it look a bit like a Scotch Opening.} exd4 5. Nxd4 {5. Nxd4 - pawn trade.} d5 {5. ....... d5 - I have a difficult connundrum here.  Should I allow NxN busting my pawn structure or should I trade knights and allow the Wicked Witch of the West to sit pretty on d4.  I decided on the standard line opener d5.} 6. Bg5 {6. Bg5 - this develops a piece and pins my knight on f6.  I decided to prepare castling by breaking the pin at the same time with Be7.} Be7 7. Nxc6 bxc6 {7. ...... bxc6 - after the knight trade my pawns have been duly split up.} 8. e3 Ne4 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 {9. ....... Qxe7 - both dsbs have been traded.} 10. Nd2 Nxd2 11. Qxd2 {11. Qxd2 - and the final pair of knights are traded, at least I do not have to worry about Freddy's horsies, they are a menace, let me tell you!  But, worse luck, there is still the Wicked Witch.} Qd6 12. Bd3 c5 {12....... c5?! - Freddy stated in his post match pm " 12. ..... c5 started a battle in my favour for the center squares.. 12...0-0 should have been the move to make... but no real harm done just a slight tactical error.. you keep the balance until you made your next positional error 18...Qe5 in these sort of positions you have to keep making threats to keep me from doing my thing - making that move gave me the initiative so 18...Bc6 was the move to make simple but effective."  I suppose it did open a line up for the Wicked Witch or Freddy's lsb to land a check on the a4-e8 line. } 13. c4 d4 14. O-O-O Be6 15. Qc2 h6 {15. .... h6 - my h pawn evades a line up of Freddy's lsb and the Wicked Witch, but I will have to pay great attention to this line up if I choose to put Henry on the kingside.  I worry about the queenside because Freddy has the open b column as a ready-made line of attack against Henry.  Maybe one of my threats should have been Rb8 and Qb6 then to put him under a little pressure.  Maybe Henry might have been fairly safe on d7 perhaps.  But then, where is Henry ever safe in a game against The Master Mater.} 16. Qa4+ Bd7 {16. ..... Bd7 - ah, that queen check puts paid to any thoughts of moving Henry onto d7, Fou Leblanc retreats there instead.} 17. Qa3 O-O {17. ..... 0-0  I finally castle but is Henry really safe?} 18. Bc2 Qe5 {18. ...... Qe5? - see my note to move 12.} 19. exd4 cxd4 20. Qd3 {20. Qd3! - The Wicked Witch threatens mate on h7 and my d4 pawn is twice attacked and only defended by poor Glenda.  She tries to counter-attack bless her but this will bite me on the btm big time!} Qg5+ 21. Kb1 g6 {21. ...... g6?! I received a pm from andywm, who said ..... Hello, jstevens1!   I didn't like move 21 for you. I like to keep all my K side castle pawns intact. I think that is where it started to crumble.   Andy ........  Do you the rest of the Inquest Jury agree with this?   If so, do you suggest an improvement?} 22. h4 {22. h4 - tempting me with the g2 pawn and I take the bait .....  Oh dear, I have known Freddy long enough to realise that if he "overlooks" a hanging pawn, he is after something, doh and double doh to Jo!} Qxg2 {22. ...... Qxg2?? Freddy's post-match pm stated "22...Qxg2 - well I think you can see why that is bad and those moves are almost always bad..... creating an open file creates pinning possibilities and more initiative for the opponent.. 22...Qf6 safes the day just virtually a pawn down but still in the game... } 23. Rhg1 Qc6 24. h5 Be8 {24. ..... Be8 - Fou Leblanc bolsters my g6 pawn x-ray style but this does not work.} 25. Rde1 Kg7 {25. ..... Kg7?? - Freddy condemned this move because of what was to follow.  He then went on to say ..... 25...Qc5 and still game on.. lose the pawn but still there to fight another battle.} 26. hxg6 fxg6 27. Rxe8 {27. Rxe8!! - We cannot have a Freddy game without a brilliant exchange sac!  In order to win a game one must be prepared to sac material for better gains.} Qxe8 {27. ...... Qxe8 - Freddy suggested that 27...Rfxe8 was more logical here.} 28. Rxg6+ Kf7 29. Qf5+ {29. Qf5+ - Freddy now asks me to get my exercise book out, it's time to make a puzzle - for he announces #4.  In fact it turned out to be #6.} Ke7 30. Qe4+ {30. Qe4+ - #5.} Kf7 {30......Kf7 - Freddy suggested that Kd8 would have prolonged the game.} 31. Qd5+ {31. Qd5+ - #4.} Ke7 32. Re6+ {32. Re6+ - Freddy is not interested in Glenda although that in itself is a very nasty skewer, Henry is doomed because it is #3.} Kf7 33. Qf5+ {33. Qf5+ - #2} Kg8 34. Qh7# {34. Qh7 MATE!! - Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, the checkmate that I had been trying to avoid for many moves has taken place.  Not a very nice picture.  Now what have we learned from this ..... well ..... maybe eating poisoned pawns causes terrible squitters or worse ..... so think before you grab, I thought it was OK but I should have perhaps analysed more carefully.  Maybe you the jury have some more ideas to put in the mix here.  Anyhow - to all of you - HAPPY NEW YEAR!!  - Joanne}
