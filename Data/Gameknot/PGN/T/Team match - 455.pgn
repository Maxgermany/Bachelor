1. f4 {I believe this is the weakest possible opening.  There is a two move checkmate that begins this way.} e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 d6 4. Nc3 a6 5. d4 d5 6. Ne5 {So far white has developed his position well.} Qe7 7. g3 Nfd7 8. Bd3 f6 {Time to trade knights.} 9. Nxd7 Bxd7 10. g4 Nc6 11. f5 {My guess is black will castle on the queen side, and white's far flung king pawns will provide no great advantage. } O-O-O 12. fxe6 Bxe6 {With this one pawn exchange black brings great power over the central squares.} 13. Bf5 Bxf5 14. gxf5 Kb8 {? Seems like a wasted move.  } 15. Qf3 Nxd4 16. Qh3 {Qg4 would have had the added advantage of threatening the black knight, while still protecting the pawns.} Nxc2+ {Whoa, I overlooked that too.  Classic fork.} 17. Ke2 Nxa1 18. Kd2 {?  What?  Black doesn't have a white bishop.  Why move the king, and why to a BLACK square?} d4 19. exd4 {? Nothing is protecting that pawn from the black rook check.} Rxd4+ {Worse yet, white must now interpose the queen.  White could hold out for a draw, but in this case honor suggests toppling the king.} 20. Qd3 Rxd3+ 21. Kxd3 Qd6+ {}
