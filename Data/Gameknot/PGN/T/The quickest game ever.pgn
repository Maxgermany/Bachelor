[Round "1"]
[White "Gibaud (IM)"]
[Black "Lazard (IM)"]
[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {Gibaud, against his fellow Frenchman Lazard, opens with a move that usually leads to a long, slow game... not this time!} Nf6 {Lazard responds with a Hypermodern move.} 2. Nd2 {I fail to see the merits of this move... it seems to impede White's development...} e5 {Lazard plays to open up the game and exploit White's loss of time.} 3. dxe5 {Gibaud lunges at the Pawn...} Ng4 {Lazard continues to be aggressive...} 4. h3 {This horrific blunder ends things before they start!} Ne3 {Lazard doesn't miss the opportunity. If Gibaud tries to save his Queen with 5 PxN??? he runs into 5... Q-R5ch 6 P-N3 QxP mate. Gibaud resigns. This is the shortest master game on record!}
