1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 {Standard stuff. I have recently shown preference to either the Nimzo or the Bogo Indian which have very similar plans. I used to prefer c5 to intiate the Benko Gambit which is exciting to play but these lines are safer against stronger players} 3. g3 Bb4+ {Seems natural to chuck in the check to gain a tempo} 4. Bd2 Qe7 {So i have reached a Bogo Indian position and white has not got Knight f3 in so if i am right i am a tempo up.} 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Nc3 Bxc3 7. Bxc3 Ne4 {The point of course now is to remove this bishop and Black has no problems whatsoever and equality is achieved.} 8. Bg2 O-O {Natural and so is his reply} 9. O-O Nxc3 {It is a pity but i think i am forced to take it now in case of Be1 which now raises the question whether the time spent doing it and damaging his pawn structure is worth it?? } 10. bxc3 {I personally think it is but it is a matter of taste. } d6 {The idea is now to play e5 and if d5 then we have transposed into a Nimzo of sorts without the usual counterplay for white as his bishop on g2 will be blocked in.} 11. Qd3 e5 12. Nd2 {Preparing perhaps to go to e4? I do not really agree with this one. I think he had to play d5 or e4 straight away as this wastes time and allows me to play......} f5 {Now i am trying to control e4 to prevent his knight going there.} 13. e4 {Well now he blocks his own bishop it is simple to see my next move.} f4 14. Rab1 {Somewhat annoying but after looking at this i could see he has no real threats but to avoid any checks i played safe with.....} Kh8 {Now b6 is threatened} 15. h3 {Not quite sure what he planned here. Perhaps he was thinking of g4??} b6 {I am sure you are all seeing what comes next. The standard Nimzo Ba6 Na5 situation.} 16. Kh2 Ba6 {Step 1} 17. Bf3 Na5 {Step 2} 18. Rb4 {This has to get a question mark. After my next move his rook ends up entombed.} c5 19. dxc5 {This is just bad for him. He is solidifying my pawn structure and ensuring his is weaker for the duration of the game. Additionally i am going to gain control of the open file.} dxc5 20. Ra4 {Got to be bad. Now if you look that rook will never make it out again the Knight and pawn control all the squares.} Rad8 {Natural move} 21. Qc2 {Only move to avoid the Qd7 trick (Qe2 Qd7 wins a piece)} Qd7 {But due to tactical reasons i do it anyway} 22. Rd1 {Forced} fxg3+ 23. Kxg3 {Forced} Qd3 24. Qxd3 {Could not see anything better for him.} Rxd3 {If you were white this would be annoying at best to face??} 25. Kg2 {Only move as Kg4 Rf4+} Rfxf3 {Time to cash in} 26. Nxf3 {No choice} Rxd1 27. Nxe5 {Grab some material back but the problem for him is that Rook on a4. } Kg8 {Stops any annoying checks. There is no rush my Bishop and rook will work against the Knight whilst the white rook is entombed.} 28. f4 {A blunder} Bb7 {The Bishop makes the final move of the game and my opponent resigns. The point is that King f3 Rook e1 wins the pawn.  I would keep my bishop on this diagonal and combined with the rook be able to take all the other pawns without ever allowing his rook back into the game.  I do not think i won this game. Rather my opponent went on self destruct!}
