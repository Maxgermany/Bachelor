[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence"]

1. e4 e5 {We open up our queens and kingside bishops...} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {...then I bring out my knight to defend my pawn...} 3. Bb5 d6 {...but have to bring up a pawn to defend its neighbour.} 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 {My pawn structure is distorted here...} 5. h3 d5 6. Nxe5 dxe4 {...but we create more space by swapping pawns...} 7. Nxc6 {...and lose the pawn that removed the bishop to fall behind...} Qd6 8. Na5 {...so I force the knight to retreat.} Ne7 9. d3 {This move played into my hands...} exd3 {...because I have opened up the e-file where the kings start...} 10. Qxd3 Qe5+ {... and I split the king and knight, enabling me to snaffle the latter...} 11. Be3 Qxa5+ {...here.} 12. c3 Qd5 {Now I line up the queen...} 13. Qxd5 Nxd5 {...and we swap.} 14. Nd2 Nxe3 15. fxe3 {I remove the other bishop, in exchange for my other knight, as I have move bottom rank pieces (certainly more diagonal power). In fact, all my survivors are still in their initial positions.} Bb7 {I unleash my white-square bishop to attack the g-pawn...} 16. Rg1 {...but my opponent covers it...} O-O-O {...but I can still castle queenside to bring a rook into play...} 17. O-O-O {...which my opponent copies.} Bc5 {Now I unleash my other bishop to attack the e-pawn...} 18. Rde1 {...but that is covered too...} Rhe8 {...so I bring my other rook into play to line up a two-pronged attack.} 19. Nc4 Ba6 {I line up the knight with the bishop...} 20. Rgf1 {...but my opponent fails to cover it...} Bxc4 {...and I accept the gift, also covering the f-pawn...} 21. Rxf7 Bxf7 {...and my opponent gets a very nasty surprise!} 22. Kb1 Bg6+ {Now I move in for the kill...} 23. Ka1 Rxe3 {...and bring a rook onto the attack...} 24. Rc1 {...forcing my opponent to move the rook out of the way...} Red3 {...so I double up on the d-file...} 25. b3 {...and my opponent plans a possible escape route...} Rd3d1 {...so I pin the remaining rook down to its starting rank...} 26. Kb2 Rd8d2+ {...and give the king nowhere to hide. My opponent let this game time out, because the only possible moves were 27. Rc2, my response 27... Rxc2#, and 27. Ka1, my response 27... Rxc1#.}
