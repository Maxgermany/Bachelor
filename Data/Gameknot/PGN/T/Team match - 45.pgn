1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Scotch opening.  Usually pretty good start for white. } Bd6 4. d5 Nd4 5. c3 Nxf3+ 6. Qxf3 h6 7. Be3 a6 8. Nd2 Qf6 9. Qxf6 Nxf6 10. f4 {Questionable.} exf4 11. Bd4 Be7 12. g3 fxg3 13. hxg3 O-O {Black is not wise to castle, now that the queens are cleared from the board and white's h file is open.  Especially not on the king's side.} 14. Be5 {Easily defended, coaxing black to move the pawn he wants to move anyway to let the bishop out.} d6 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 16. O-O-O Bg4 17. Re1 Bg5 18. e5 {White sheds another pawn.} Rae8 19. Bh3 {Nice recovery!  Looks like it had been part of the plan all along.} Bf3 20. Rhf1 Bxd5 21. Kc2 {Kb1 would protect a2 while getting the king off black's black bishop diagonal.  I assume Kc2 was to free Nd2 for movement.} Bxa2 22. Bd7 Re7 23. Bf5 dxe5 24. Nf3 Bc4 25. Rf2 a5 26. b3 {Nxe5 can wait.} Bb5 27. c4 {This helps advance white's pawns at the expense of black pushing the same piece again and again.} Bc6 28. Nxg5 {White is ill advised to make even exchanges while down four points, even if this opens wide the black castle's back door.} hxg5 29. Rh2 g6 30. Bd3 e4 31. Kc3 {Nice.  LET black take that bishop--I dare you!} b6 32. Reh1 {If black takes the bishop, black loses Rf8.  Black is wise not to rise to this bait.} f5 33. Be2 Kg7 34. g4 e3 35. Rg1 {White acknowledges the exposed threat.} f4 36. Rf1 f3 37. Bxf3 {Black has two pieces on Bf3, white only one.} Bxf3 38. Rh3 Bg2 39. Rxf8 Kxf8 {BxRh3 was probably better, guaranteeing black Pg4 to boot.} 40. Rg3 e2 41. Rxg2 {Kd2 would probably have been better.} e1=Q+ 42. Kc2 Qe4+ {}
