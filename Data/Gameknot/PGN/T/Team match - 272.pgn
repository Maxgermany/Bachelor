O-O Nf6 7. b4 {Mistake?  Probably not.} Bxb4 8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9. Qa4+ {Nope!  Not a mistake.  I think he has tried this before.} Ned7 10. Qxb4 c5 {Now I have to wait and see if the b2 pawn gets caught in the crossfire between the Bishop and the Queen!} 11. Qb3 O-O 12. Bf4 {Great move giving two angles on the Rook.
