[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Graz variation"]

1. e4 {One of the most flexible moves to the start of a game, and perhaps the best. It opens up a line for the bishop and queen, and puts a pawn in the centre.} e5 {The King's pawn opening, a good opening if Black does not wish to do the Sicilian; 1. ...c5.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Both sides develop their knights.} 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez, a exciting opening which has many lines. } a6 {3. ...Nf6, the Berlin Defence, is also quite feasible, but he wishes to stick to the main line.} 4. Ba4 b5 {This move, the Caro Variation of the Ruy Lopez, is quite O.K, though no opponent against me has ever played it before.} 5. Bb3 {In this position, Black can play the Norwegian Variation, which hunts the bishop with 5...Na5, or he can continue 5...Bc5, the Graz Variation, a sort of Classical Defence only with the pawns on a6 and b5. But Black chooses something else...} h6 {?! I consider this move as a waste of time. Why would the bishop come to g5 anyway?} 6. c3 {Proceeding along with my plan of advancing the pawns in the centre.} Nf6 {A logical move, which makes me have to defend e4 before I advance my pawn to d4. I think if Black wanted to play this move, he should have played it on his fifth move, rather than ...h6.} 7. Bc2 {Defending my pawn.} Bc5 {!? This position could also have been reached from the Graz; 5...Bc5 6. c3 Nf6 7. Bc2 h6. However, 7...0-0 is more popular than 7...h6.} 8. O-O d6 9. d3 {!? I could have plunged in to complications and played 9. d4, but I felt this was a little too loosening. So I decided to move the queen to e2, the bishop to e3, and exchange bishops. Then with some of the pressure off, I could play d4.} Bg4 {I think I should have played h3 sometime, so I played it now, instead of going along with my plan.} 10. h3 Bxf3 {?! This move is not positionally correct. White will open up the centre sooner or later and Black will do well to keep his bishops because it is said that bishops work well when the centre is open. Better is 10...Be6.} 11. Qxf3 b4 {!? Trying to get some queenside counterplay.} 12. Be3 Bxe3 13. Qxe3 {My plan has been done, but now Black has a advance in the centre which he played.} d5 {! Black tries for some play in the centre.} 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Qc5 {!? Qe4 and Qe2 are okay, but I decided on a tricky move.} Nce7 {?! The bad merit to this move is that it is a passive move. When the centre is opened you should play actively. It also leaves the pawn on e5 weak. I threatened to take it with my next move.} 16. Re1 bxc3 17. bxc3 O-O {? The first obvious mistake. Black leaves the pawn on e5 en prise! Better was 17...Qd6, the only way to defend the pawn, although White should be a lot better in the ending.} 18. Rxe5 Re8 19. d4 {I advance my pawns in the centre to attack. Note that this move also secures the rook, and opens the c2-h7 diagonal for the bishop.} f6 {? This move should not be taken into consideration. This is a positional secession, weaking the light squares and strengthening the power of the bishop. There is another reason which becomes apparent soon.} 20. Re2 g6 {? Another bad move, weakening the kingside pawns.} 21. Bb3 {! Pinning the knight. Now we can see why ...f6 was a bad move. Now White can make the advances c4 and d5 without much difficulty. } c6 {Trying to secure the knight's position, but it fails.} 22. c4 Nf4 23. Rd2 Qc7 {? A move which fails to see the winning move.} 24. d5 {!! A great move. Black cannot capture the pawn with his pawn because White captures with his queen.} Nfxd5 {? The position is very bad for Black. However, this knight sac was not needed.  Better was 24...Qb7 or Qb8, but after Ba4! Black loses his c6 pawn.} 25. cxd5 Kg7 {Black has to avoid the discovered check, but now White has a winning fork.} 26. d6 {! Winning the knight, but I had other plans.} Qb8 {? One could take the knight, but I had other plans...} 27. d7 {!! This devastating move forces Black to wave the white flag. Taking the knight would still win, but I prefer the move I made in the game.} Qb5 {Desperation.} 28. dxe8=Q Rxe8 29. Qd6 Kf8 {?? This oversight cost Black the game immediately. Black could well play on with something like Qf5, but would still lose in the end.} 30. Qxf6# {A great game which the basic rule is:The passed pawn, when advanced, can be devastating. I hope you enjoyed this annotation. Thank you.}
