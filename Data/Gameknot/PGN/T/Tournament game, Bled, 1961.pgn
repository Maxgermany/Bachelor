[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C72), modern Steinitz defence, 5.O-O"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {The Ruy Lopez, one of the most analyzed openings in history. Even in 1961, there were very few surprises left. But Geller has one prepared.} 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. c3 {Standard book stuff so far. But...} Qf6 {...Geller springs his surprise! 7...N-B3, 8 P-Q4 N-Q2 is the more solid "book" line. Geller throws caution to the winds and intends to try and smash Fischer's K-side quickly.} 8. g4 {Fischer decides to counter sharply rather than relying on passive defense.} Bg6 9. d4 {This sacrifices a Pawn in return for a quick attack.} Bxe4 10. Nbd2 Bg6 11. Bxc6+ {Wrecking Geller's Q-side Pawns.} bxc6 12. dxe5 {If 12 Q-R4 instead, 12... K-Q2! holds for Black. But 12... N-K2? 13 PxP PxP 14 R-K1! is very strong for White. Would Geller have been able to find the correct move over the board? We'll never know.} dxe5 13. Nxe5 {Wining back the sacrificed Pawn and opening attacking lines.} Bd6 14. Nxg6 Qxg6 {14... RPxN would fall to 15 N-K4!} 15. Re1+ Kf8 16. Nc4 h5 {Geller is still trying to open a line leading to Fischer's King.} 17. Nxd6 cxd6 18. Bf4 {Threatening BxP ch.} d5 {18... R-Q1 is the alternative.} 19. Qb3 hxg4 {Geller tries to counter by threatening a discovered check.} 20. Qb7 {Sealing Geller's fate.} gxh3+ 21. Bg3 Rd8 22. Qb4+ {Geller resigns. If he plays on, 22...N-K2 23 QxN mate, or 22...R-Q3 23 QxR ch N-K2 QxN ch wins 2 pieces.}
