1. e4 {I find that the King pawn, althogh unoriginal gives me a smoth opening.} d5 2. e5 Nc6 3. d4 g6 4. Bb5 Bh6 5. Bxh6 Nxh6 6. Nf3 Bd7 7. O-O f6 8. exf6 e6 {I was surprised at him not taking my pawn, I guess i didn't bother to protect my down field investment so I moved my...} 9. Ne5 Qxf6 {& his queen gobbled him up.} 10. Nxd7 {I knew I had to take a piece, so I felt having him move his king was best.} Kxd7 11. Na3 {Looking back at it, I see that moving the knight out then and there was probably a wasted move. As are a number of moves after this. I think I wasn't paying attention at this point in the match. This goes to show that you should not play chess when watching football. I think I lose a ton of momentum in thes next few moves.} Rae8 12. c4 Nf5 13. cxd5 exd5 14. Qf3 Re4 15. Nc2 Kc8 16. Bxc6 {I can remember what I was thinking here. Doh! I guess I was hoping that he would take with the pawn on b7, but as I soon realize he didn't...} Qxc6 {Like I said, I wasn't playing at my sharpest. I got an even trade when I needed to make him sacrifice SOMETHING! Such as protection, and i just missed it for some reason.} 17. Rac1 Qb6 18. b3 Nxd4 19. Qh3+ {Now I go down a pawn, and Im just trying to stall.} Kb8 {I actually thought he would move the knight back to f5 to block, not wanting to sacrifice it.} 20. Ne3 {But as I find out soon he had other plans for mr. knighty} Ne2+ {at this point Im singing " I can see clearly now the rain is gone!" haha I have no idea what I am thinking. Just stupid.} 21. Kh1 Nxc1 22. Rxc1 {being pick apart feels like being eaten alive.} d4 23. Nc4 Qe6 24. Qxe6 {At this point, I think I have a little hope. Cause normally Im not totally reliant on my queen, so if I can trade, I'll do it. In this case Im down by three and Im down a rook which are what you need in the end game with no queen. Soooo Basically Im screwed :(} Rxe6 25. g3 {Now's time for a little cat and mouse. Unfortunately, Im not the Cat!} Re2 26. Kg2 Rhe8 27. Rd1 Rf8 28. Rf1 d3 29. a4 d2 30. b4 d1=Q {I didn't think he would sacrifice a queen to get position, I thought he would make me sacrifice my knight to take out the pawn, by moving his rook to d8, but I was wrong and he played a great finish so he didn't need a queen.} 31. Rxd1 Rfxf2+ 32. Kg1 {I moved down, because I was hoping that he would at some point need to get an extra move to get around my rook, and he would forget all I needed was one move and I would steal a mate from him. Unfortunately He didn't fall for it. To be honest I didn't think he would, But you can't blame me for tryin. lol} Rfg2+ 33. Kf1 b6 {All my hopes are dashed!} 34. a5 b5 35. a6 {I try one last gasp, hoping he takes the bate...} Kc8 {but he doesn't.... so I must move my knight} 36. Na5 Rgxh2 {I lose my pawn, that I wrote off earlier.} 37. Nc6 {still hoping against hope that he thinks I gave up on mate... } Re8 {but nope, he's on top of it, willing to sacrifice the pawns, to gain a much bigger prize! at this point, Im not sure if he planed this or if my scraping and clawing to get back in this game made miss whats about to come and he just took advantage of it. Either way it was nice.} 38. Nxa7+ {All the time making me think I was in control..} Kb8 39. Nxb5 {Here it comes....} Rh1+ {BAM!!! you sunk my battle ship!} 40. Kg2 Rxd1 41. a7+ {One last hurah!} Kb7 42. Kh3 Rd3 {I thought he was attacking my pawn and King... foolish me, he trapped my knight, DOH! should have moved him earlier. Oh well the game is all but over at this point.} 43. Kh4 c6 44. g4 cxb5 45. a8=Q+ {Just trying to be smart! haha lol one last check!} Kxa8 46. Kg5 Rd4 47. Kh4 Rd3 48. Kg5 Rf3 49. Kh6 Re7 50. Kg5 Kb8 51. Kh6 Kc8 52. Kg5 Kd8 53. Kh6 Ke8 54. Kg5 Kf8 55. Kh6 Kg8 56. Kg5 Kg7 57. Kh4 Re5 58. g5 Re4# {Nice check mate, you played a good game!}
