1. e4 {I have had problems in the past to move to a on sided attack if the middle is locked or semi locked.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Standard} 3. Bb5 d6 {I knew him taking would screw up my pawn structure..} 4. Nc3 Bd7 {blocking} 5. d3 a6 {pushing away} 6. Bc4 h6 {blocking any future Bg5, also preparing to push if he castles kingside} 7. O-O Be6 {forcing the trade, this would double the e pawns and open the f file if I castle kingside} 8. Bxe6 fxe6 {accepted} 9. Be3 Be7 {trying to get the bishop active} 10. Ne2 Qd7 {opening to castle queen side} 11. c3 O-O-O {rex to safety} 12. Qb3 g5 {starting to push, his queen side attack will take a while to get started so I start some doubt by pushing} 13. h3 {he starts the defence} Na5 {trying to get Qa3, discovered attack by d5} 14. Qa3 Nc6 {working} 15. Qb3 g4 {fell through, so sacing the g pawn to open up some lines} 16. hxg4 Nf6 {getting another piece in} 17. Nh2 {deffending} h5 {thsi one I could pull back faster} 18. gxh5 Rxh5 {done, still one down, looking at Rdh8} 19. Ng3 Rh7 {expected} 20. Qd1 Rdh8 {now i have him in defence mode} 21. Ng4 Nh5 {I did not want to trade on g4, wanted h1 undefended...  any comment here?} 22. Nxh5 Rh7xh5 {accepted} 23. f3 Bh4 {Blocking his retreat throughf2 } 24. Bf2 Qe7 {Did not want to trade here, wanted to build my attack and how better to trade on my grounds - getting the queen in there if he know trades} 25. g3 Bg5 {Covering the h6-c1 square - this will be handy later.  His bishop now blocks his retreat} 26. Kg2 Qh7 {getting the battery on line, thinking I might sac the rook on h2, Nx f2, qxf2} 27. Bg1 Rh1 {He stoped rh3, but i still got a rook down there} 28. f4 Qh3+ {Getting the queen in there, I had calculated at least 5 moves ahead, up to the queen trade} 29. Kf3 exf4 {using his pinned pawn on g3, preparing Qxg3+} 30. Bf2 Rf8 {this looked stupid at 1st - but it was my best move - if 31. rfxh1 fxg3+ 32. Ke2 Qxg4+  33. Ke1 Qxd1+, 34 Kxd1 RfxF2, This looked fairly even but I had a passed pawn which I fancied, with 2 pieces for a rook and pawn} 31. Ke2 Qxg4+ {Dont know if he calculated it to, but this suited me better, I was hoping for this variasion} 32. Kd2 Qxd1+ {Queen trade, no 3 up} 33. Rfxd1 {Here I had to re calculate, trading would only lessen the pressure, but I still have my dominant bishop that would win me a piece} fxg3+ {thought I had his bishop} 34. Be3 Rf2+ {I will have it soon enought though  Forcd mate in 2 -35. Kc1 Only move Bxe3+ 36 Kb1 (only move), Rxd1} 35. Kc1 Bxe3+ 36. Kb1 Rxd1# {Though I did pretty well with the calculations, did I miss any other moves?}
