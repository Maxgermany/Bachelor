1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bc4 O-O {Because everyone loves the dragon ...} 8. f3 Qb6 9. Bb5 Nxd4 10. Bxd4 Qa5 {Pinning the knight.} 11. O-O a6 12. Bc4 b5 13. Bb3 d6 {Developing and creating space for the black bishop and hoping to create strong counterplay.} 14. Nd5 {Seems strong. After the exchange my rook is hanging, and both white bishops are preventing it from escaping.} Nxd5 15. Bxd5 Bxd4+ {The check is required to save the rook.} 16. Qxd4 Rb8 {Qa7 is not the threat that Ba7 would have been, now I have to get the bishop of the back rank and develop.} 17. e5 {The exchange of pawns is obviously bad.} e6 18. Bb3 d5 {However, locking the position up here is outstanding for black. Now there is a fighting chance to remain in the game.} 19. h4 Qb6 {Forcing the exchange.} 20. Qxb6 Rxb6 21. c3 d4 {Played the sacrifice to get some counter-play.} 22. cxd4 Rd8 23. Rfd1 Bb7 24. Rac1 Bd5 {Played the exchange as it is hard to see how white can continue to defend the d4 pawn.} 25. Bxd5 Rxd5 26. g4 {Seems strange. I think white had to work to double rooks.} Rb7 27. Rc6 a5 {black really has not pulled this off, white can play b3 and Ra6 - I'm not doing a good job here. Alternatively Rc2 or Rc3 can simply defend the d pawn.} 28. Kf2 {Fortunately this allows black to level material.} Rbd7 29. Ke3 Rxe5+ {d pawn pinned - the exchange seems like material should stay even.} 30. Kf4 Red5 31. Ke3 e5 32. Rc2 Kf8 33. Rcd2 Ke7 34. dxe5 Rxe5+ 35. Kf2 Rxd2+ 36. Rxd2 Ke6 {Draw agreed with even material.  Game annotation for team benefit --}
