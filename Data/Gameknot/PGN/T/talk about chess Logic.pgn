1. e4 {This is my traditional move where by i attempt to make a quick win by going for f 7......I admit it only works on weak opponents......so i use this opening to size up my opponent and see what i am up against} c5 {I see no threat yet so i continue with my initial plan} 2. Bc4 {going for f 7} e6 {Now  i know my opponent is not a beginner} 3. d3 {Now that i know my opponent is not an amateur, I begin to release my pieces, i have nothinng in mind yet } Nc6 {well I continue releasing my pieces from the back line} 4. Nf3 {no game plan yet} Nf6 {still no danger} 5. Nc3 {planning to keep pushing pieces until opponent makes first error} d5 {I m not sure of his intentions yet so i just wait} 6. exd5 {I eliminated the pawn on d5 because I want to keep that white diagonal open for my bishop n c4} exd5 7. Bb5 {Wekk I have to keep the bishop safe} Bg4 8. Bxc6+ {I took this opportunity to trade 3 points for 3 but i forced him to have two pawns in the same line.......It feels like an advantage of some sort} bxc6 9. h3 {Well I should have defended square g4 a long time back} Qe7+ 10. Kd2 {With this move I am trying to keep a straight path to his Q and King....to try an get his Queen} d4 11. Re1 {I am trying to get that Q} Be6 {I was too greedy, I should have taken that Bishop} 12. Ng5 {My plan still has not changed at this moment} g6 13. Re2 {I need more pieces to attack E6 so i am creating the space for my Q to support rook} Bh6 14. f4 dxc3+ 15. bxc3 {I have no choice but to eliminate the pawn in d3} Bg7 {I dont understand why he made that particular move} 16. Qe1 Nd5 {oh I see what he is up to...he wants to capture my Q by attacking C3 with his bishop} 17. Bb2 {I just have to defend and continue with my assault on E6} Nxf4 {Just keep the pressure on E6} 18. Re4 {Just keep the pressure on E6} Nxg2 {He is trying to force me to reduce my pressure on E6} 19. Qe2 {But I wont, Now his knight is up for grabs} Qxg5+ {Actually my knight was up for grabs.....I didn't see that one...I guess i have to improve my concentration} 20. Kd1 O-O {now I am so under attack...I have to reorganise my defence} 21. Rb1 Bxh3 {I am not sure of his plan.....so i just play along} 22. Ba3 {nothing much...just creating space} Bxc3 23. Bxc5 {I made this blunder and m happy he missed it} Rfd8 24. Rb7 {this was a blunder too because my Bishop is still in danger.......but I did not see it at the time} Rab8 {obvious move i have to trade} 25. Rxb8 {obvious move i have to trade} Rxb8 26. Re8+ {Now I have a chance to get something big here} Rxe8 {I have to get that rook} 27. Qxe8+ {I have to get that rook, its the only logical thing to do,}
