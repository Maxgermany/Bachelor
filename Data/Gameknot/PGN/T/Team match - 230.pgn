[Opening "Polish (Sokolsky) opening (A00)"]

1. b4 {Hi, chessplayers. I will show my best game in my life, may be. My opponent played the Sokolsky opening, where white takes space advantage in queenside and allows than the black stays in the center (white can, late, attack that center).} e5 {The classical move. Also, black can move 1... Nf6 and 1... d5.   } 2. a3 {This move is theoretical, but I prefer 2. Bb2} d5 3. Bb2 Bd6 {Oftenly, I use this move for most of openings and defences not commons. Another option with development was 3... Nd7 (no 3 ... Nc6 4 b5 Nd4 5 e3)} 4. e3 {White initiates an center attack (can choice push f4, c4 or d4, obviously, with care )} Bf5 {Development at the center. Now, if 5 f4 Nd7 keeping the center stress.} 5. c4 {White attack the center from the queenside. Now, the square d3 is weak and the bishop in f5 is well placed. } c6 {Prevents effects of c5 advance} 6. Nf3 Nd7 7. Be2 Ngf6 8. Nc3 O-O {Normal development for both players in the last moves. It's time to evaluate the position, white has spacial advantage in the queenside and can fixed the c6 pawn for attack with the pawn's chain. Black had more space in the center and the posibility to attack the kingside in case of short castle (and, more, can take kingside advantage with e4 if white plays d4).} 9. Qb3 {White adds pressure in d5. Black can choice Be6 or dxc4 (not Nb6 c5). Too, white can play 9 d4 e4 10 Nd2 and, late, Qb3} dxc4 {A hard decision, but, now, black wins two tempos and the d5 square is a post for the knight. The game is showing your morphology. Now, c6-pawn is a target for minority attack but black has dynamical advantages. } 10. Bxc4 Nb6 11. Be2 Qe7 {Freeing the d-column for a rook. If Qc7 with same idea and threat e4 in case of castle, white can play quite Rc1.} 12. O-O Rfd8 {I choice this rook for the d column, keeping the chance of play a5, if I need active my queenside.} 13. d4 {I think than this move is a blunder. More consistent was Rfc1 and b5. A possible line was 13 Rfc1 e4 14 Nd4 Qe5 15 g3 Bg6 with complex position} e4 {Now, white has a cramped position and black takes the initiative in the kingside} 14. Nd2 {May be, the only move. If white plays 14 Nh4 Be6 15 Q moves ... Ng4. Else, 14 Ne1 Nfd5 15 Nxd5 Nxd5 with attack} Bc7 {A flexible move, black can play 15 Qd6 or 15 Rd6} 15. Rac1 {I was waiting for the another rook in this position. White must play a minority attack with b5, thus, Rfc1 and Rab1 are most logical, in my point of view. Rac1 gives to the king more space!.} Rd6 {If 15... Qd6 I calculated 16 g3 Bh3 17 Rd1 and now Nfd5 is answer with Ndxe4. Black must keep the pressure in the e-pawn! The rook can attack the kingside over h6 and g6.} 16. a4 Nfd5 {Freeing  the way to the kingside.} 17. Nxd5 Nxd5 18. b5 {If 18 Nc4 Rh6 19 g3 Rxh2 20 Kxh2 Qh4+ 21 Kg1 Bxg3 22 fxg3 Qxg3+ 23 Kh1 Nxe3 or Bh3} Qg5 {if 18 Rh6 I had fear about 19 f4 gxf3 20 Nxf3 and protect h2. I saw, with this move, if 19 f4 gxf3 20 Nxf3 Qxe3+. I didn't see than the queen in e7 too attack the pawn in e3 if white plays f4!!. In conclusion, I wasted a tempo for attack!} 19. g3 Rh6 20. Rfd1 {This move gives to the king the f1 square. But, the crucial move was 20 bxc6 when I calculated 20 ... Rxh2 and if 21 cxb7 Bxg3 22 bxa8=Q+ Bb8+ and mate in the next. Else 21 Kxh2 Qh4 22 Kg1 Bxg3 23 fxg3 Qxg3+ 24 Kh1 Nxe3 25 Qxe3! Qxe3 26 cxb7 with threat Rc8+, Rxf5 and bxa8=Q+. Now, black must play with care. Computer gives to the black 2 point of advantage in this position, but I amn't sure. } Rxh2 {The combination is possible here, too.} 21. Kxh2 Qh4+ 22. Kg1 {I don't write last, but, in all the similar position, if white plays Kg2 follow Qh3+ and Bxg3 fxg3 and Qxg3 with the same position.} Bxg3 23. fxg3 Qxg3+ 24. Kh1 Nxe3 {Black has mate threat.} 25. Bf1 Bh3 {Now, 26 Rc2 defends the second rank but Bg2+! with mate} 26. Qxe3 Qxe3 27. Bxh3 {A final blunder, I don't think so in the game. If white plays 27 bxc6 was better options, this line recommend the chess engine. } Qxh3+ 28. Kg1 e3 29. Nc4 Qg3+ 30. Kh1 Re8 31. Rc2 e2 {}
