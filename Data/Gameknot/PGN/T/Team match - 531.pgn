1. e4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 3. Bd3 Nf6 4. Qe2 e6 5. Nf3 c5 {6.d5 d6 7.c4 Be7 gain space, i think it's better} 6. c3 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nc6 8. O-O Bc5 9. e5 {2 good bishop for white versus a possible castle...but 2 good bishop for black versus a castle done. It's necessary push away the c5 bishop with b4 and start an attack on queenside to be ready in every side; i think with the right plan the white is a little better} Nd5 10. Nxc6 {i think it's too soon to exchange a good knife with a not yet good knife} Bxc6 {maybe, or probably 10... dxc6 is better to have a queenside castle more sure} 11. Qg4 {i think b4 - a4 waiting for black decition about his castle} Qc7 {now is clear that the black'll castle on queenside} 12. Qxg7 {i think a beginner's wrong: - 2 good bishop versus the castle - a new problem, the G-column (a pawn it's now enough...) - some time will be lost to save the queen from rook attack  it's a strange move for a good player...in general computers make this kind of wrong} O-O-O 13. Bxh7 {another coloum for another pawn....it's really too} Rxh7 14. Qxh7 Qxe5 {Rh8 it's too strong knife jump it's too strong bishops are too strong} 15. Qd3 Rg8 16. g3 Qh5 17. Be3 Qf3 18. Nd2 {too late to develop own pieces} Qg2+ 19. Kxg2 Nf4+ {with mate with Nh3}
