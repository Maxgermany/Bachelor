Nbd2 {Typical maneuver.} Bf8 {To add more support on e5. I was planning Bxf7+, Kxf7, and then Ng5+ and get a superior position, but black has some defenses. i just play Ng5 to misplace the rook.} 12. Ng5 Re7 13. d5 {To make the misplaced rook more of an advantage to me.} Nb8 14. Nf1 c6 {This move I overlooked. Now my e-pawn will become weak and the d-file will be in black's favor.} 15. dxc6 Nxc6 16. Ng3 {To get to f5. } g6 {To guard f5.} 17. Nf3 {My knight serves no purpose on g5 anymore.} Bg7 18. Bg5 Qc7 19. Bxf6 {This move makes it easier to outpost on d5.} Bxf6 20. Nf1 {To do Ne3 and get to d5.} Rd8 21. Ne3 Na5 {To attack the bishop and protect d5.} 22. Bd5 Bg7 23. Bxb7 Qxb7 24. Nd5 Ree8 25. Qe2 {To connect rooks.} Nc4 26. Rad1 {To centralize the rook.} Kh8 27. b3 Nb6 {I must now relinquish my outpost.} 28. Nxb6 Qxb6 29. c4 {To get d5.} Rdc8 30. cxb5 axb5 31. Rd5 {To attack b5 and later attack d6.} Rc5 32. Red1 Bf8 33. Rxc5 {I was going crazy with trading this game.} dxc5 {Not Qxc5 due to Rd5 winning b5.} 34. Rd5 {I do it anyway.} Bd6 {Perhaps better would be Qb8, protecting b5 and e5.} 35. Qd2 {Applying pressure on d6. Moving the bishop out would be best.} Re6 {Loses the bishop.} 36. Ng5 Rf6 37. Rxd6 {Here, black resigned. The lesson here is to understand the importance of weak squares and how to make use of them.}
