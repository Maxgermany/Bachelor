1. e4 {This is my fourth annotation. In this annotation I would like to show you how you can come back from being the underdog near the beginning. As said in previous annotations, I always start with the king's pawn.} e5 {One of the most common defences for this move. I was actually expecting this.} 2. Qf3 {Probably not the best option. Blocking a knight and a pawn. Attacking the black pawn on e5 would have been better.} Nf6 {Just in case I went for the early checkmate, it was blocked.} 3. Nc3 {So my knight comes out to further defend the king's pawn.} g6 {Could have played a move that opened up the centre of the board a bit more.} 4. Bc4 {The bishop comes out and my pieces start to take territory on the board.} c6 {A move which opens up a queen and closes off a knight. } 5. d3 {Opening up the bishop on c1 to dominate the centre of the board.} b5 {Comes to attack my bishop.} 6. Bb3 {The only place I could move without being taken.} a5 {About to close in my bishop. This is unstoppable, so I keep playing until he decides to attack.} 7. Bg5 Be7 {The defence for the knight. Also defending his queen in the process.} 8. O-O-O {I castle queen side. Time to defend the king. Castling usually puts the king away and pretty safe if the pawns in front are there. Give the king a bit of room to move around though, otherwise if trapped, the game could be over in a few moves.} h6 {Attacks my bishop on the black square.} 9. Bh4 {I move to still attack the knight.} a4 {If I am about to lose a bishop, I might as well take something anyway.} 10. Bxf6 {Tried something else first.} Bxf6 {And to no surprise, the bishop is taken.} 11. Nxa4 {I take the pawn on a4 and in the process, losing my knight.} bxa4 12. Bc4 {I put my bishop away to safety.} Bg5+ 13. Kb1 {Not much else I could do.} O-O {Black castles king side. White still has most control over the board.} 14. h4 {A very not-so-smart move losing another pawn.} Bxh4 15. g3 {I go for the attack again waiting for black to retreat.} Bg5 16. Nh3 {The knight comes out to attack the bishop again.} Bf6 {Black moves the bishop out.} 17. Ng1 {A waste of a move, really, although opening the attack on h6.} h5 {Of course, black sees this and blocks the h-file attack.} 18. g4 {Still trying to attack on the side.} Ba6 {Didn't expect that. But then again, what was black meant to do?} 19. Qe3 {The queen moves to attack the h-file. If the pawn on h5 is removed, the path to checkmate is near.} Bg5 {The bishop comes to attack my queen. Time to try another attack.} 20. Qh3 {Sticking to the h-file still.} Bxc4 21. dxc4 {Exchanging bishops.} c5 {Opening the knight in black's defensive line.} 22. gxh5 {Time to deliver the h-file attack.} gxh5 23. Qxh5 Kg7 {So close.} 24. Rd6 Rh8 {Blocked, forking my rook on the other end. Unless...} 25. Qf3 {I defend it too.} Qe7 {My rook is under attack from the queen. Black has taken domination of the board.} 26. Rxh8 {Exchanging rooks in the back corner of the h-file.} Kxh8 27. Qh5+ {Giving my rook more time to get out of there.} Kg7 28. Rd3 {Really the only way to save my rook was to move it out.} Qf6 {Attack on the f2 pawn.} 29. Nh3 {If I can get that bishop out of the way, I might be able to finish black.} Bh6 {Defending the king, ensuring not to lose the game.} 30. Rg3+ {Attack on the g-file.} Kf8 31. a3 {Opening up the king for a not-so-nice attack from black.} Nc6 {Knight comes out from the defensive line.} 32. c3 {Maybe opening up the king a little too much.} Ke7 {Black gets his king out of the black line to give the rook a bit more space at the back.} 33. f3 {Just making sure the pawn won't get taken.} Na5 {The knight wins a pawn.} 34. Ng5 {The knight comes in hoping the bishop would move away and get taken by the rook.} Bxg5 35. Rxg5 {I do exactly that.} Rh8 {The rook is planning to get my king on the defensive line.} 36. Rxe5+ {I check the king.} Kd8 {He moves back. Maybe Kd6 would have been better in winning the rook.} 37. Qg5 {Had to get the queen away.} Qxg5 {We exchange queens which is not so good for me as even though we are close on points, I'm running out of pieces to work with.} 38. Rxg5 Nxc4 {Black takes my pawns one by one.} 39. Rxc5 {We both try to win each other's pawns.} Nd2+ {And also to get the other player into a bad position. topknot33 tries to corner my king and blocking off my openings.} 40. Ka2 {Maybe Kc2 would have been better.} Nxf3 {Slowly losing my pawns. Maybe Rh1 would have almost finished it.} 41. Ra5 {Trying to fork the rook on the other side of the king.} Nd2 {Maybe black didn't see that.} 42. Ra8+ {Successful.} Ke7 43. Rxh8 {If I capture the knight, maybe I could win.} Nxe4 44. Rh4 {Hoping the knight wouldn't move to Nc5.} Nc5 {I knew it. Black obviously wouldn't give up a pawn. Why would he anyway?} 45. b4 {Hoping that black wouldn't pull of the en passant. See how much luck I'm depending on?} Nb3 {The en passant would have worked better and the promotion of a queen would have come up quick.} 46. b5 {I try promote my own pawns, and also attacking a4.} Kd8 {Winning a pawn at this time of the game is pretty good. Black is running out of checkmate options, and is a few points down (which is not that bad).} 47. Rxa4 {I win the pawn. This game has turned dramatically after losing by the same amount of points (please see the_golfer vs obee_ton as I prove that being ahead doesn't really matter in the end).} Nc5 {Not unexpected for black. What else was there to do? Maybe Nc1 though...} 48. Ra7 {Trying to promote my pawn would definitely win the match.} Kc8 {The king comes in. At this stage, the king is vital in achieving checkmate.} 49. Ra5 Kb7 {The king closes in on winning the rook or pawn.} 50. c4 {The pawn defence.} f5 {Better be careful now. The f-file pawn is free and is soon going to turn into a queen.} 51. Kb2 {I try to stop it with my king. I will get there first even though we are going at the same slow pace.} f4 52. Kc2 f3 53. Kd2 f2 54. Ke2 Ne4 {Not unexpected (yet again).} 55. Ra6 {The rook moves up on the a-file attempting to promote a pawn.} Nd2 {Nd2 allows me to take the almost promoted pawn, but lose c4.} 56. Kxf2 Nxc4 57. a4 {Moving up to support promotion.} Na3 {Comes in for an attack on the pawns.} 58. a5 {Losing b5.} Nc4 {Decides not to go with it.} 59. Kf3 {If I lost my pieces, I would need to get my king into the action.} d6 {A slow way to get a pawn promoted on the d-file.} 60. Ke4 {The king keeps going.} Kc7 {And black finally moves away.} 61. Kd5 {What will black pull off now?} Na3 {The knight is back where it moved four moves ago. A waste of moves?} 62. b6+ {The pawns are past halfway.} Kd7 {The king would have been better of Kb7 although I would have responded Ra7+.} 63. b7 {The pawn is on the last line.} Kc7 {Of course black would do that.} 64. Rxd6 {Ra7 would have been better there.} Kxb7 {Losing a pawn. Made some bad decisions here.} 65. a6+ {The king is running out of options.} Ka7 {Annoying, as I don't have much to work with anymore.} 66. Ke6 {So I try to close the king in with my own king. Expecting the knight to move now.} Nc4 {Nice move. If black clears the pawn, the white king is free.} 67. Rc6 {Is black going to finally retreat?} Nb6 {Here comes the interesting part of the game.} 68. Kd6 {Probably the best move I could pull.} Kxa6 {The knight is now forked to the king. Time to take it.} 69. Kc5 Kb7 70. Rxb6+ {Success. The game has turned unexpectedly for me.} Kc7 {Now to trap the king in the a-file corner.} 71. Rd6 Kb7 72. Rc6 Kb8 73. Kb6 Ka8 {The last legal move and the last move for black.} 74. Rc8# {The game ends in a win for me, although I played a lot of silly moves, I could still come out to win. I would like to thank topknot33 for the game. It was great to play with you. Thanks also to blake84120.}
