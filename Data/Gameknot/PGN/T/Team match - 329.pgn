[Opening "Caro-Kann (B14), Panov-Botvinnik attack, 5...g6"]

1. e4 {The most respectable move from white as far as I am concerned. So is d4. I pay attention now. } c6 {I usually go this route, the Caro-Kann. I learned it from a blind man. } 2. d4 {The expected standard move on the Caro-Kann. } d5 {The move most natural to Caro-Kann. } 3. exd5 {Okay. Queen or pawn to take it out?} cxd5 {I chose the pawn. } 4. c4 {Caro is flexible to development. } Nf6 {I develop pushing aside the nd2 until later. } 5. Nc3 {Pressure. To make a good move. d5 is protected. The developed white knight is in a line of fire from a fianchetto I can create. } g6 {So I do the fianchetto. } 6. Qb3 {Out comes the white queen on the queen side. I can deal with it using the Caro. } dxc4 {Attack and pressure on the white queen to do something like taking the pawn. } 7. Bxc4 {He uses the king's bishop instead. Now for the e6. } e6 {I do it. Caro is Flexible to all attack. That's why I like it. } 8. Nf3 {Clearing house (white) to develop and 0-0. Rather understandable. } a6 {This "foot pawn" denies check by White. A simple one move forward of a pawn to make the game more complicated. In Caro the game WILL get complicated at the cost of the opponent. } 9. O-O {Safety for the king for white. } b5 {Pressure from the Caro formation here which started so indiscriminately. Caro-Kann is my favorite defense against e4. In a time clock face to face I will always choose Caro over Sicilian or any other defense against e4 open. Always. It works. It works most times. It has flexibility and power. It does not entrench like the entrenching French Defense (basically a blockade waiting for white to make a mistake--but I prefer attacking instead of hiding under a blockade. I hate the French defense because it is only a defense. The Caro is a counter attack. } 10. Be2 {Retreat from White. } b4 {Caro is still attacking. } 11. Nd1 {Retreat from white. } Nc6 {Gotta get that knight out now. Never leave knights or bishops in the rear in the middle game. } 12. Be3 {White has the same feeling to get out another piece. Was that the right place to put the developing bishop?} Bb7 {Evacuating my own other bishop. Didn't want to block the Queen's line of fire. I also wanted to get the capability of doing a disclosed attack on white's f3 knight or g2 square with or without that pawn being there. } 13. a3 {White is trying to simplify. } Na5 {The Caro makes the simplification more than simple: attack a more valuable piece.  Guard the Queen! } 14. Qc2 {She retreats. } Rc8 {Under attack again...} 15. Qd2 {Safe for the queen on white but the queen is rather enclosed and unable to do much....} Nb3 {Attack her. } 16. Qd3 {In a fixation here...} Nxa1 {...at the cost of material.  Don't ever underestimate the Caro-Kann.  If you never tried it you've never seen what it can do.  If you do the Ruy or Sicilian or Alekhine's or any other (avoid the French Defense) you'll find out why I learned the Caro-Kann from a blind man in Seminary.  And we were in a hot and educated Seminary we got into with four year Bachelor's Degrees to even apply.  }
