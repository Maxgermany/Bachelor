[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The Philador defence, an opening that I have not encountered before.} 3. c4 Nf6 {White's e4 pawn is in jeopardy!} 4. d3 {both players simply start protecting their e-pawns from each other's knights.} Nc6 {Black's knight aims to challenge d4.} 5. Nc3 Be6 6. Nd5 Nd4 {The center catastrophie!} 7. Nxd4 exd4 8. Be2 c6 9. Nb4 {white blocks his pieces in (exept for his Queen). Never try attempts if they weaken your position.} Qa5 10. Bd2 {The most unusual way to try and earn a knight.} Qc7 11. a4 c5 12. Nd5 {Center challenge #2!} Nxd5 13. exd5 Bf5 14. O-O O-O-O {both sides castle opposite ways. The center pawns are staring into nothingness, as they block each other from getting to the other side} 15. a5 a6 16. Bg4 {An open e-file and a probable bishop trade.} Bd7 17. f3 {Here we go. the pawn is blocking the queen out.} f5 {White has a smart idea after 18...fxg4. This however fails because if black's bishop moves, the queen has punishing offence.} 18. Bh3 g6 19. Bg5 Re8 20. f4 h6 21. Bh4 {This is an example of what you should not do to a bishop. Black's pawns start up the oven to cook white's kingside. White's bishop should have played 21.Bf6, but black must refrain from playing 21...g5.} Be7 22. Bg3 h5 23. Bf2 g5 24. fxg5 {nice attempt to grapple the game white! Unfortunately, it deepens the weakness as 24...Bxg5.} Bxg5 25. b3 Ref8 26. g3 f4 27. g4 Qd8 {Black probably got a little weak with the unorganized pawn structure, but that is no reason to give up the game.} 28. Qf3 Bh4 {The battle of h4 begins!} 29. Bxh4 Qxh4 30. Ra2 Bxg4 {Unbelievable, there is now a g4 war!} 31. Bxg4+ hxg4 32. Qe2 g3 33. Qe6+ Kd8 34. Qxd6+ Ke8 35. Re1+ Kf7 36. Qc7+ {Qxc7? leads white's queen astray. White should have tried 36.Qe6+. Black ends up with White's kingside in his grasp.} Kg8 37. Rg2 Rh7 38. Qxc5 {Never pawn-snatch when your kingside is in trouble. Besides, the white queen is too late to help out the overwhelmed and crushed army.} Rg7 39. Qxd4 Rg4 40. d6 f3 {This is why pawn snatching is a common chess mistake.} 41. Qd5+ Rf7 42. Rxg3 Rxg3+ 43. Kf1 Qh3+ {I feel bad for white being crushed. I seriously feel bad, but black's last move was unwise. If black had done 43...Qxh2!, then he has a force mate in 1. Feel free to post a comment, suggesting something you see, but I did not see.}
