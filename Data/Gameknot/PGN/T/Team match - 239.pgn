1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 {B80 Scheviningen Sicilian} 6. Bg5 Be7 7. Qf3 {This queen move seems too early, but I'm not sure how exactly to make white pay for it.} Nbd7 8. Rd1 a6 9. Nb3 Qc7 10. Be2 O-O 11. Qg3 Rd8 {I see a lot of Schevingenin games where the rook goes to e8 rather than d8. But I typically play it to d8 to support the d5 push. There is a risk of the f6 knight getting pinned and reduced mobility for the e7 bishop, but so far I haven't been punished for placing the rook on d8. Still waiting to see why so many players in international play place the rook on e8.} 12. Bh6 Bf8 13. a4 b6 14. Nd4 Bb7 15. f3 Ne5 16. Bg5 Be7 17. Qh3 Nc4 {Terrible move by black. I saw the outlines of the tactics but played this move somewhat hastily without double checking all of the consequences.} 18. Nxe6 fxe6 19. Qxe6+ Kh8 20. Qxc4 Rac8 21. Qxc7 Rxc7 {Why not just simply castling here for white?} 22. Rf1 d5 23. Bf4 Rcc8 24. e5 Ng8 25. Be3 Bc5 26. Bxc5 bxc5 27. Bd3 Ne7 28. Rb1 c4 29. Be2 Ng6 30. b3 cxb3 31. Rxb3 Nxe5 32. f4 Nd7 33. Rxb7 Rxc3 34. Kd2 Ra3 35. Rfb1 Nc5 {Good spot for the knight - provides many options.} 36. Rb7b8 Rg8 {}
