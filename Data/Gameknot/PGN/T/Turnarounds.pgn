1. e3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c3 {My opponent is scared by my superior ELO and plays passively, but... hey! It happens that he is playing almost as I do (but my dsb is out!). } Bf5 {Now mine is. I always say to black: "play c5" (now or later). But in this case, I felt I had to pospone it. } 4. Nd2 e6 {I can't hurry very much. Just play proper (something very difficult for me to do!)} 5. f3 {White is delaying developement, but I can't see the way to take advanage of it. } Bd6 {Almost surely not bad. I had Nh5, and if g4, Qa5+, g3, Nxg3... a known pattern. } 6. g3 {White goes on with his strategy. But I can't see exactly how to punish him. He pushes his pawns. So he provides targets for me to addres. The only piece to attack pawns are pawns, and my strenght is on white squares, so...} h5 7. Bh3 {Oh My, white is going for a draw!} Bd3 {Let's have some fun. } 8. Nb3 Ba6 {Ok. I condemn this good bishop to this side, but look at his diagonal!} 9. Nc5 {White has to stop it. That's ok. I will get the tempo in return. For what?} g5 {For attack, of course! Nc6 had no intention nor caused some worry for white.} 10. Nxa6 Nxa6 {N on the rim, supports c5. Not bad. } 11. Bg2 {Thinking in a central break. } g4 {I'll break first, in the sense that if white goes...} 12. f4 {I'll still have...} h4 {It can seem a naive threat, but for the coming of the Q, in a very unexpected way. } 13. Bd2 Ke7 {This one. I open the way for the Q to h8. } 14. a3 {White fails to see the danger, here. } hxg3 15. hxg3 Rxh1 16. Bxh1 Qh8 {Played instantly. Now white will lose a piece. } 17. Bg2 Qh2 18. Qe2 Qxg1+ {The N being the best choice for both of us. } 19. Qf1 {Now, easy was QxQ etc, and play with the extra piece. But I wanted to see if I could get something more from my ONLY active piece, and remembered a tactic...} Qh2 20. O-O-O Rh8 {It seems a mistake, but...} 21. Qf2 Rh3 {This saves the day for black. } 22. Be1 {...and this matches the move for white. Now black (me) goes into the mists and...} Rxg3 {?? A plain blunder. } 23. Qxg3 Qh7 {After all, I am just -1! Let's go on playing...} 24. Bf2 Qg6 {This was to be free to move the N. } 25. Rh1 Ne4 {It's a weird way to defend my pawn, but the idea is that after BxN, QxB and the R is en prise, so i will have a tempo to play f5, while my king escapes the other side of the board, being white's Bs unactive for the moment. } 26. Qh4+ Kd7 {Nothing had changed. } 27. Bxe4 Qxe4 28. Qxg4 {?? My opponent blundered the rook.} Qxh1+ 29. Kc2 Qh7+ 30. Kb3 c5 {Break quickly. } 31. Bh4 c4+ 32. Ka2 {The best was Qc7, but what happens with white's penetration, and where's my mate?} b5 33. Qg5 Qh8 {White threats a nasty check on Qc8, I have to avoid at all costs. } 34. b4 {? White gives me a hole. } cxb3 e.p.+ 35. Kxb3 Qc8 {Controls d8 but threats check. } 36. Kb2 {Wisely!} b4 {Prepared to sac the N!} 37. axb4 {...but after all, it was not so easy as it seemed. } Nb8 {This N is destined to c6, controlling the black squares, so my Q can move freely. } 38. Qf6 {f7, the altenate threat. } Qe8 {I'm not sure I'd like the Q exchange. My pieces are still caged in. } 39. f5 {Don't worry, be happy. Nothing more than an exchange. } Be7 {I started to reaize I had no attack. I better go exchanging and win with the extra piece, after all. } 40. fxe6+ fxe6 41. Qh6 {White wants to keep the Q on. } Bxh4 {I want to stop bother. } 42. Qxh4 Qg8 {...and this is a threat on g2. } 43. b5 {My opponent tries to block my N, and it is a nice idea, but..} Qg2+ 44. Kb3 Qf1 {My queen is threatening a thousand things, now. } 45. Qh7+ {I know I will lose a pawn, but I just want to get to that magical situation in which a N can guard a K against any check, with a couple of pawns's help. } Kd8 46. Qg8+ Kc7 47. Qe8 {Defending b5. } Qb1+ {I can play the same game. } 48. Ka3 Qc1+ 49. Kb3 {...and with no results. I can't see any way to progress further. But now I will do what he should...} Qxe3 {Being the point that with this I defend e6. Now I have to mobilize my N and grab some more pawns. I just missed a mate...} 50. Qe7+ {I shall play Kc8, but I am not threatening his pawns, so I don't want him to take mine on a7. } Kb6 {because c4 is impossible!} 51. Qd6+ Kb7 52. Qe7+ {In the previous moves, black can't take b5 or Qb7+. Can white get a draw?} Kb6 53. Qd8+ Kb7 54. Qa5 {This gives me a break. } a6 {I can dare to play this. Incredible. } 55. bxa6+ Nxa6 {My N is finally free. } 56. Qb5+ Ka7 57. Qd7+ Kb6 58. Qd8+ Kb7 59. Qd7+ Nc7 {...that's it. Now the WQ can't check me, and W is forced to give me a tempo!} 60. Qa4 Qe2 {Again, threatening to force a Q exchange, now lethal, } 61. Qb4+ Nb5 {?? wanted to overdo. There was no need of anything else, but I did. Now I'll be punished!} 62. Ka4 {Kf6 was enough, but again white could draw. I was thinking about Qc5, but after QxQ the N falls!} Qa2+ {I had a quick vision of a mate sequence, but I overlooked...} 63. Kxb5 Qa6+ 64. Kc5+ {...that this is check! I thew away my advantage, and now it's a draw!} Kc7 65. Qb3 Qc6+ 66. Kb4 Kd6 67. Ka3 e5 {I fight, but it's a draw. } 68. Qb4+ Ke6 69. dxe5 Kxe5 70. Qe7+ Kf5 71. Qh7+ Ke5 72. Qh2+ Ke4 73. Qg2+ Kd3 {With white's help, I am approaching the other pawn...} 74. Qf3+ Kc4 {White had not centralized his king, and this is the result: near to a mate net. } 75. Kb2 {Escaping it. } Qb5+ 76. Kc1 Qc5 {Nothing more that I can see, but these engames are really tricky. } 77. Kc2 d4 {Offering a draw!} 78. Qf7+ {Does white wants to win?} Qd5 {Draw offer N2.} 79. Qf1+ {Playing cat and mouse. But not this time...} d3+ {Uh-oh!} 80. Kd2 Qg5+ 81. Kd1 Kxc3 {White couldn't have refused the draw. } 82. Qe1+ d2 {White can't even check. White resigned, but I am not sure I could win. }
