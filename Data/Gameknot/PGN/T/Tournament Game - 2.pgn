1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 {The English -- so far, so standard.} 3. g3 {Unusual, but playable. The fianchetto is intended.} Nf6 4. Bg2 {White clearly intends to play for the central light squares.} Bb4 {Balck counters with an aggressive move.} 5. Nd5 {Posting the Knight to a strong outpost.} Nxd5 6. cxd5 {In exchanging, White attacks the Black Knight and begins preparing a pitfall.} Nd4 {Rather than retreat, Black remains aggressive.} 7. e3 {Leaving Black one safe and one fatal alternative.} Nf5 {The wrong choice. 7... N-N4 was the correct move.} 8. Qg4 {Forking both pieces. Black resigns at once.}
