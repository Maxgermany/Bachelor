[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C60), Cozio defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {I don't normally play the Ruy Lopez, but why not?  The opening is logical and allows white to castle quickly.} Nge7 {Interesting defense.} 4. O-O d5 {Better are g6, d6.  I was expecting g6.  Without it, he's going to have a rough time castling kingside if he wants to.  Time to see how he handles pressure.} 5. Nxe5 dxe4 {Somewhat expected though not too good.} 6. Qh5 {Keeping up the pressure.} Qd5 {His threat is an illusion.} 7. Nc3 {Putting the test to his "threat."} g6 {He knew it was an illusion, but this is illusory too.  Qe6 is much better.} 8. Nxd5 {It is always good to ask yourself, "What happens if I allow him to do what he wants to do?"} gxh5 {Bait taken.  White has a forced mate.} 9. Nf6+ Kd8 10. Nxf7# {The pivotal f7 weakness!}
