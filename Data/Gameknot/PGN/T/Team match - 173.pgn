1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 {Berlin Defense of the Bishop's Opening. } 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nd5 {NxNd5 yields the best result for black, according to the database.} Nxd5 5. Bxd5 Na6 {Na6 drifts out of the database.  The typical response (good for black) is Pc6, though in a few games black does well with Pd6.  O-O seems to give white an advantage.} 6. a3 c6 {I like this.  It pushes the bishop while giving the black queen access to the board.  Not that you want to bring her out into the field--but it is nice she has a passage.  The engine likes Be7 better, though, deducting 1.15 points for this move and calling it an "inaccuracy."} 7. Ba2 {The engine prefers BxPf7+, a non obvious move that pulls the black king into the field.  Material stays the same, but white achieves a better position.} Be7 {...and the bishops withdraw.} 8. Qf3 {Oh ha ha, white seeks a quick end to the game.  Black sees through this hollow ploy, defending with O-O.} O-O 9. d3 b5 10. Be3 d6 11. Qg3 {White next intends to take the black rook with Bh6--another cheap trick.  Black could open the castle with Pg6.} Bh4 {But this works even better.  The white queen is forced off the g file.} 12. Qf3 Qf6 13. Qxf6 {White retires the queens from the field.} Bxf6 14. h3 Re8 15. Nf3 Be6 16. Bxe6 Rxe6 17. O-O h5 18. h4 Nc7 19. g3 d5 20. exd5 Nxd5 21. c3 Be7 22. Bd2 a5 23. c4 Nc7 24.
