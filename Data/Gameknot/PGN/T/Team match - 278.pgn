1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Classsic Sicilian Defence, Narjdorf variation} 6. Be3 e5 7. Nf3 Be7 8. Bc4 O-O {Sicilian Defence, Najdorg, Byrne (English) attack} 9. Qd2 Nc6 10. h3 b5 11. Bd5 Nxd5 12. Nxd5 Rb8 13. O-O Be6 14. c3 f5 15. Ng5 Bxd5 {I guess this is where I messed up. Rather than taking the d5 knight, I should have taken the g5 knight. He takes it with the bishop, I move Queen to d7 and he will probably do Qd3 or f3.} 16. Qxd5+ Kh8 17. Nf7+ Rxf7 18. Qxf7 {You served me well, rook.} fxe4 19. Rad1 b4 20. Rd5 bxc3 21. bxc3 Qg8 {Saw a chance and I took it. Forced to trade queens.} 22. Qxg8+ Kxg8 {Of course, accepted.} 23. Rfd1 {I'm wondering why he did Rfd1. Re1 would have been better. He does that, I would move my king to attack the Rook and follow pawns, and he will probably move Bc1 in an attempt to do Ba3.} h6 24. g3 Rb2 {Going for the pawns, attempt to even out the score.} 25. Rd1d2 {Should have used the idle d5 rook, where we would have exchanged rooks.} Rb1+ 26. Kg2 Rc1 {Second attempt, other pawn.} 27. Rb2 {Don't really see why he did this.} Rxc3 {Evening the score. Rook doing all the work.} 28. Rb7 Kf8 {Kf8, freeing my knight.} 29. a4 Rc4 {Attacking the pawn} 30. a5 Nb4 {Attacking the rook.} 31. Rd1 d5 32. Bb6 Rc2 33. Rc7 d4 34. Rxc2 {I wouldn't have traded the rooks just yet, but attack the knight. I probably would have still gone for a queen with d3, but I would have attacked the knight.} Nxc2 35. f3 {The worst mistake ever. I guess he wanted to move some pawns up, but that was just the wrong one. Would have moved g4. His rook is mine!} Ne3+ 36. Kg1 Nxd1 {Yay.} 37. fxe4 Bb4 {Protects that d2 spot.} 38. Kf1 Nb2 {Protects d1 and d3. Looks like I'll be paying a visit to the Buckingham Palace.} 39. Bc7 {Going for that e5 pawn, I guess so he can take that then take the knight but really doesn't help much, queen!. I thought he would keep that bishop there in preparation for Be3, which is sort of annoying but I'd still win.} d3 {... But he didn't, a victory coming to Prince Marcus; all thanks to his f3. Kate Middleton is mine now.}
