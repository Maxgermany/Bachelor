1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 {Not a great idea to bring out the queen so early. Common moves instead are Nc6 and Nf6} 3. Bb5 {? Somewhat pointless, as black can win a free move with c6 or a6} Bc5 4. O-O a6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 d6 7. d3 Nh6 8. Be3 Qg6 9. Bxc5 {White is somewhat carefree, and allows black to begin some complications. Re1 was safer} Bh3 10. Nh4 Qg5 11. Qf3 {White is OK though, as black is attacking with only two pieces, and with black king yet uncastled.} Bg4 {A first serious mistake. Black is a piece down, and should be thinking about collecting it back. It seems like white has to move the queen and then the c5 bishop can be taken, but black calculated one or two moves short. Better was 11. ... Qxh4 12. Be3 Bg4} 12. Qg3 {Pinning the bishop to the queen} dxc5 13. h3 {Winning the piece back} f5 {? When in trouble, it's important to keep calm. Black's disadvantages before this move were: loss of a piece and uncompleted development with black king in the center. The latter could be improved by castling NOW. Moreover, white couldn't immediately start attacking as the center pawns protected black. With this move, black helps white by opening lines in front of the king, and ruins own chances of castling (black can't castle for a few moves now)} 14. hxg4 {White is not pushing the advantage. Qxe5 with check was killing.} fxe4 {Good trap by black, though. } 15. dxe4 {And white falls into it. Much better was 15. Bd5 c3 16. Bxe4} c4 {Now black gets the piece back, and is down only by a pawn. If he could castle safely without losing too much material, then the game can still be equal} 16. Nc3 {White has a clever plan to win a piece.} cxb3 {Since the bishop could not escape anyway, it was a better idea to castle first.} 17. Nd5 {If you could see the two forks on c7 and then on e6, then you would not have castled, but moved Ra7.} O-O 18. Nxc7 Ra7 19. Ne6 {Nice combination by white, regaining the advantage of approximately one piece.} Qf6 20. Nxf8 Qxf8 21. Qxb3+ Kh8 22. g5 {White is playing actively, and does not let black regroup. } Ng4 {A mistake that loses the knight. Notice it has no safe squares now, should white attack it with f3, or with 23. Qh3 Qf4?? (to protect the poor knight) 24. Ng6 !!, or as in the game with Qe6. Better move was Nf7 or at least Ng8} 23. Qe6 {Black has a weak back rank, so he can't defend the knight with Qf4.} Rf7 {There really isn't much black can do now, but try to survive and see whether white will get careless} 24. Qxg4 Rf4 25. Qh5 Kg8 {Good defence against deadly Ng6 !} 26. Rad1 Rxe4 27. f3 Ra4 {The rook is now too far from the main action: around black king. Rf4 or Rc4 seem better.} 28. g6 h6 29. Qxe5 Nc6 30. Qe6+ Kh8 31. Qxc6 Rc4 32. Qxa6 Qc5+ 33. Rf2 Qf8 34. Qxb5 Rxh4 35. Re2 {It's lost now. I would resign.} Rf4 36. Re8 Rf6 37. Rxf8+ Rxf8 38. Re1 Kg8 39. Re8 {So, in this game, black made the common mistake of starting the early attack with just two pieces, while forgetting to castle. White defended and won a peice after the blunder by black on move 11. Another mistake by black opened up the center so white's attack was made much easier. Black almost gained an equal game after white's mistake that lost white bishop, but did not hold on to it after overlooking white's clever double fork. So, overall, white played good in both attack and defense (with only one serious mistake in the game), but black made several mistakes stemming from not calculating just a few more moves, and not castling before beginning an attack. The first can be helped much by using the analysis board in critical positions.}
