1. e4 c5 {Silican defence... I just think of this as a reverse English Opening, my choice opening for White} 2. Bc4 {bringing his bishop to the a2-g8 diagonal} Nc6 3. c3 g6 {preparing to bring my bishop out to the long diagonal} 4. d4 {offering an exchange....} cxd4 {which I accept} 5. cxd4 Bg7 {so far, these moves remain a part of the GK database - white has solid control of the centre; all of Black's pressure is on the d4 square} 6. d5 {This move, however, is not part of the GK database. Most played in this position is 6. Nf3} Ne5 {moves out of danger ond threatens White's bishop} 7. Nd2 {good developing move which gives support to the bishop} Nf6 {preparing to castle, and developing my knight. There is also the threat of winning a pawn with 8...Nxe4 9.Nxe4 Nxc4, which will also, at the end put pressure on the b2 pawn} 8. b3 {that attack becomes more powerful here, as it puts White's rook in direct attack from the bishop.} O-O {instead, though, I develop, not realising what I could do} 9. Ndf3 {hoping to pressure my knight, perhaps chase it around the board....} Nxf3+ {so I decide to exchange. This wasn't the best move here, though; Nxe4 would have been better, as it gives my other knight protection with the bishop, and threatens a knight-for-rook exchange (10...Nd3+ 11. Bxd3 Bxa1) Also, White would not be able to exchange because of 10. Nxe5 Bxe5 11. Rb1 Nc3, which forks Queen and Rook} 10. Nxf3 {although this move stops White doubling his pawns....} Nxe4 {it leaves me free to take his e-pawn (I guess this should have been done earlier)} 11. Bd2 {a good move - White sees the danger of the Queen-Rook fork and opts for an exchange instead....} Qb6 {I do not go for it straight away, however - instead, I aim for a mate} 12. O-O {the best move here} Bxa1 {In hindsight, I'm not so sure about this move - I've just given up a powerful bishop for a semi-trapped rook. Also,the Queen, at a1, proves to be a big part of my loss in just a couple of moves from here. However, I do win on the exchange, and I had no idea at the time how powerful the Queen would be there} 13. Qxa1 d6 {what I was planning to do next move was 14...Bg4, to drive away the knight and win the bishop at d2. I don't realise the danger until....} 14. Bh6 {(!) this is similar to my third annotation ('The power of a pawn') where the king was trapped with a pawn on h6 and a queen on f6. It looked good for Black up until now, but now White has turned the tables} Nf6 {I probably had a chance to save myself with 14.... f6. I don't know why I played this move.} 15. h3 Rd8 {I decide to move my rook while I can still save it, but....} 16. g4 {I realise what White plans to do - too late - and aim to strengthen my defence} e5 {the only move that will add defence to my diagonal} 17. g5 Ne4 {I think I should have let White have that knight - his own pawn would have blocked the Queen} 18. Nxe5 {I can't retake because of the queen} Bxh3 {I'm desperate at this point - I plan to form some kind of attack to distract White and find some way to fight back!} 19. Nd7 {My queen is a goner!} Qxf2+ {I might as well get a pawn if I have to lose my queen...} 20. Rxf2 f6 {I offer White my knight to stop checkmate - but..} 21. Nxf6+ Nxf6 22. Qxf6 {this is still a horrible position for Black!} Rd7 {the only way to save myself} 23. Re2 {another attacking piece from White is the last thing Black needs} Rf7 {trying to chase away the Queen} 24. Qxd6 {another pawn down!} Raf8 {a final, desperate attempt at a counterattack} 25. Qxf8+ {I don't know why White chose to sacrifice his queen - promoting his pawn, I suspect - but he could have achieved mate with 25. Bxf8 Rxf8 26. Qe6+ Kh8 27. Qf6+ Rxf6 28. Re8+ Rf8 29. Rxf8#} Rxf8 26. Bxf8 Kxf8 27. d6 {I can't reach that pawn because of White's rook.} Kg7 {I had no options, I couldn't counterattack...} 28. Re7+ Kf8 29. Bf7 Kg7 {the only place the King can move...} 30. d7 {finally, I resign - I have no chance at all to turn this around (Team match #2 coming soon)}
