1. e4 {I open with King pawn} e5 {He follow's suit.} 2. Nf3 {I really am trying to distract him with attacking his pawn, I want to open king side castling.} d6 {he protects with pawn} 3. Bc4 {I pull out my bishop so now i have a clear back row king side while my opponent is still locked in.} Nf6 {He attacks my pawn, I think he is thinking the same thing. Hide the king!} 4. d3 {I have to advance my pawn to protect. No biggy this does several things. Opens bishop up, protects e pawn and allows my queen to stay at home. I suspect b f8 to come out.} h6 {Oh! I guess he didn't like it last time when I pinned his knight to his queen. So he take's precations this time.} 5. O-O {Ok this allows me to get him hid safe and sound. Bishop f8 now will come out.} a6 {Ok, I guess he is playing defensively. Not a bad idea, but since he's beaten two or three times in a row now I would've thought he'd think a little more aggresively.} 6. Nc3 {I advance some materail, to gain more ground in the middle.} b5 {He pushes my bishop, gaining ground in the middle with pawns.} 7. Bd5 {Threatening his rook will almost certainly get my bishop taken, but I have plenty of support} Nxd5 {expected. p e4 or knight c3?} 8. Nxd5 {I'll go with the knight, it keeps my pawn structure strong and happy. The only thing bad about this is, that my knight is an easy target from p c7 and I'll have to retreat him in back to back moves.} Be6 {He opt's for the bishop kinght trade. I'll take it if he does.} 9. a4 {So I'll advance a pawn, try to thin out his middle defenses a little.} c6 {Now he brings the pawn up... Not as confident about my middle ground hold now. That pawn line looks more daunting that what I anticipated.} 10. Nc3 {I didn't want to put him back in the same spot, but I have a feeling that I'll need his defense here very soon.} b4 {I should have figured he'd something irritating like that.} 11. Ne2 {Oh well, I have to move him 3 times in a row, which makes me lose ground} a5 {He strengthens his pawn hold on the queen side.} 12. c3 {I'll try and break up his advancing pawns} c5 {He likes that advancing pawn structure so he supports it.} 13. c4 {So I clog up the middle, which should stop the advancing pawns. And it gives strength to my own pawn structure.} Qf6 {He brings the queen out to play.} 14. Ne1 {I drop my night so that I'll have clear angles.} Nc6 {He's now bringing in support. Can't really go anywhere with it right now though.} 15. Nc2 {I see an attack I can make, but it will take a couple of moves to get the knight into position.} Nd4 {I wasn't completely caught off gaurd with this knight, but ultimately I think I moved the wrong knight.} 16. Ncxd4 {I probably should have taken with Kn e2 but we'll see if it comes back to bite me.} exd4 {That Pawn wall is becoming more and more trecherous. Im not sure if Im on the wrong side of it or not. He does have more space, but Im not feeling too bad about that... Yet!} 17. Nf4 {I could have gone with Kn to g3 but I want him to feel a little pressure. In the end both will accomplish the same thing. Plus if I can get him to attack with g7, that will open h5 up for good. } g5 {Oh yeah, that is what I was looking for. Hopefully it works out the way I plan it. Now H5 will be comepletely clear of any pawn attacks and eventually I will have f6 too.} 18. Nh5 {So I attack his queen. Im sure he saw this coming and already has a plan in motion. Even if he attacks Kn h5 I have him supported.} Qg6 {Expected.} 19. Qf3 {Now I can make my move for F6. This opens a lot for me. I expect him to bring out Bishop f8 to G7 or e7 to protect f6. If he does that I'll move Pawn to e5 to protect e6. This will open up an attack on a8 rook. His best move will be to ignore f6 all together. This should be interesting one way or the other.} Be7 {Expected. He wanted to protect f6 but didn't want to expose the bishop to kn g7. This way he also protects d6.} 20. e5 {So I push to give me an open diagonal. This should allow me to get inside his defenses. I expect him to castle one way or the other.} O-O-O {I thought he would castle, but I was betting it would be to king side. This opens a nice diagonal attack into his defenses. I just have to be careful on how to attack with my queen.} 21. Qc6+ {I choose c6 because it limits his exits and makes for an easy continued check situation.} Kb8 {his only option.} 22. Qb5+ {Thinking about this move, I should have left my queen alone and brought in reinforcements. I think this is where the game really turns, even though I thought I still had him.} Kc7 {Advances out of his corner and this allows him to bring over his Rook. I messed up by giving ground on my last move. Should have kept my queen on c6} 23. Qxa5+ {Me taking a pawn thinking I still had him. It's funny how things look in retrospect.} Kd7 {He finds what he must think of as an escape route, and truthfully I should have let him go down the rabbit hole, but I was too smart for my own good.} 24. Qb5+ {I force him back to me and he can't escape to the back rank. This ultimately allows him to bring over his rook and protect him with h8 rook. Which causes me a ton of headaches later.} Kc7 {His only move that is productive for him. had he gone to c8 it would have been a lot better for me, but sadly he is too smart for that.} 25. a5 {Unfortunately I think Im still in charge. I know I have a double barrel rook set coming at me, but I just don't react well to it. Probably thinking I still have plenty of time.} Rdb8 {Here he comes...} 26. Qa6 {I move up foolishly thinking that he will attack with both of his rooks and give me the chance to check him to death again and advance my pawn. But again he is smart enough to be content with just trapping my queen there and attacking my king with his very free queen. Oh to be able to do things over again.} Qxh5 {Im a little shocked that he didn't attack my queen with his rooks at this point. Then I notice his plan is to keep my queen hostage and I realize that I've been snookered!} 27. exd6+ {So I try to fight my way out with a little check.} Bxd6 {Unfortanately this move also play's into his hand. I have to waste a move to protect against mate on h2} 28. g3 {Again this was only a delaying motion because he was well set up for it.} Qe2 {He brings the queen down first which keeps me from moving my rook out and protecting e2. I have to keep him at home.} 29. Bxg5 {I make this move because I see what's coming and I'd rather sacrifice a bishop for one pawn than a rook and checkmate.} Bh3 {He didn't go for it at all. He traps my king and attacks my rook.} 30. Rfe1 {only move. gasping for a last breath here.} Qf3 {I can see it coming to an end soon, so I make a last ditch effort to disract him.} 31. Re7+ {sacrificing a rook just to have a glimmer of hope.} Bxe7 {he takes, so I ATTACK!} 32. Bf4+ {Im hoping for a block here by e7-d6. or for him to move to d7. This is a pivotal situation. I could lead to disaster for him if he chooses wrong.} Kd8 {But Nope, he finds the one spot that keeps this game in his favor! I realize it's over at this point. My glimmer has been blown out!} 33. Bc7+ {I check for one last hurah} Ke8 {He doesn't even take, just side steps. And I call it. Good Game.}
