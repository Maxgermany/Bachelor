1. e4 a6 {St. George Defense.  Usually pretty good opening for white. } 2. e5 b5 3. Qf3 {Nice threat to the black rook.} c6 {Easily parried with the pawn.} 4. d4 h5 5. Bg5 f6 6. Bh4 {You know what would be really cool here?  Really, really cool?  Bd3.  Let black take the black bishop (not that he would).  But if he did, Bg6#.  Kapow! } g5 7. Bg3 g4 {Ph4 might have been better, trapping the white bishop.} 8. Qf5 Rh6 {I really like Bf4 here.  Black must move the rook or lose it.  If black moves the rook, Qg6#!  Game over.} 9. Bh4 {See, the other square was so much more exciting.} d6 10. Qd3 a5 11. h3 dxe5 12. dxe5 Nd7 13. e6 Ne5 {White is going to lose Pe6.} 14. Qb3 a4 15. Qb4 Bxe6 16. f4 Nf7 17. Bxb5 {This move was a terrible sacrifice.} cxb5 18. Qxb5+ Bd7 19. Qd5 gxh3 20. gxh3 {Using the rook prevents the right side pawns getting split.  The knight would also have been a good choice--probably better yet.} Ra5 21. Qxf7+ {Disaster!  Queen for knight is not a great trade.} Kxf7 22. b4 {Pa4 can take this en passant.  Not that it helps black much to do that.} Rd5 23. Nc3 Rd4 24. Nf3 {Ne2 would have protected Pf4.} Rxf4 25. Ke2 e5 26. Nd5 Re4+ 27. Kd3 {Kf2 prevents loss of Nd5.} Bf5 28. b5 {I think I would have moved the bishop  RxBh4+ lets black seize Nd5 the following move.} Qxd5+ 29. Kc3 Re3+ {I kind of like Bb4+ for black better.  30 Kb2 QxPb5...  I guess it doesn't matter. } 30. Kb2 Ba3+ 31. Kb1 Qxb5# {}
