1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. h3 Nc6 4. d3 Nd4 5. Nxd4 exd4 6. Qf3 Qf6 7. Qe2 Be7 8. c3 dxc3 9. Nxc3 Be6 10. Be3 O-O-O 11. Nd5 Bxd5 12. exd5 Qh4 13. O-O-O Bg5 14. Bxg5 {By trading bishops black ends up with the pawn at Pd5.} Qxg5+ 15. Kb1 Qxd5 16. Rc1 Nf6 17. Qc2 c6 18. f3 Rhe8 19. Be2 Qe5 20. Rhe1 Nd5 21. d4 Qxd4 22. Rcd1 Qf2 23. f4 {White begins shedding pawns like crazy, apparently to unleash the trapped bishop.} Qxf4 24. Rdc1 {Oh, Highwayman0902 points out RxNd5 (free knight) would have been a better play here.} Re4 25. Bb5 Rxe1 26. Rxe1 Nb4 27. Qc3 Qf5+ 28. Bd3 {Interposing is, of course, a mistake when the interposed piece lacks sufficient protection.} Nxd3 29. Re3 {Another mistake.  Ne1+ gives white Pg2.} Qf1+ 30. Kc2 Nf2 {White must move either the queen or rook or black will fork them with Nd1.} 31. Qd2 {Another option might be QxPg7 which protects Pg2.} Qc4+ 32. Rc3 Qe4+ 33. Kc1 Qxg2 34. Qd4 Qf1+ 35. Kc2 {NxPh3 was another option, with the queen protecting the pawn marauding knight.} Qe2+ 36. Kb3 Qb5+ 37. Kc2 Qe2+ 38. Kb3 Kb8 39. Qb4 Nd1 40. Rxc6 {Half way clever, except QxPb2+ is going to hurt--black WANTS to trade down, enjoying a seven point advantage.  White may just lack decent options.} Qxb2+ 41. Ka4 Qxb4+ {Black could have scooped up Pa2 first, before trading queens and taking the rook.  What's one more pawn though, with this much material advantage.} 42. Kxb4 bxc6 {}
