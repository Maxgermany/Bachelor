[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Englund gambit"]

1. d4 {Annotating another game for a friend. He's playing white and opens with the Queen's Pawn.} e5 2. dxe5 {Black tries the Charlick Gambit, and unsound opening for black that is known for combative positions and opening traps, but careful play by white should easily refute this opening. White's reply is main line.} Bc5 3. Nf3 {Charlick recommended 2. ... d6, 3. exd6 Bxd6, but later analysis suggests 2. ... Nc6 which can lead to the Englund Gambit) is stronger for black. The text move 2. ... Bc5 is not in my resources. White's 3. Nf3 is the recommended reply to black's main line (2. ... Nc6) and seems sound against the move black actually played, developing a piece, defending the advanced e5 pawn, and preventing black from playing 3. ... Qh4.} Nc6 4. Bf4 b6 5. Nc3 {Black prepares to fianchetto on b7 and white continues developing.} Bb7 6. e3 {White opens the diagonal for his LSB (Light Squared Bishop) prepares to castle in a couple more moves. The pawn seems a little passive on e3 and might better have been moved to e4 instead where it would block the fianchettoed black bishop on the long diagonal, though it might become tenuous to defend it on e4.} Na5 7. Bd3 {Black weakly moves his knight to the edge of the board where it has nothing to do and no safe squares to move to other than back to c6. While it does open his bishop's diagonal, black may have been better served by 6. ... Nc6e7 followed soon by Ng6 where it can threaten the white bishop on f4 and can support a kingside attack. White responds with a fairly weak bishop move. It does clear the way for the kngside castle, but it doesn't really threaten anything. It may have been better placed on f4, but black's 6. ... Na5 contests that square. Another line of play might have been 7. a3 threatening 8. b4 to fork black's two pieces. Just the threat of the fork should cause black to retreat one or both pieces, gaining tempo for white.} Qe7 8. O-O {Black develops his queen, perhaps prematurely. This is the standard 3rd move for black in the Charlick Gambit, deferred here by 4 moves. It would be stronger if black's knight were still on c6 to exert pressure on the white pawn at e5 (black could remove a defender with Bxf3, then Nxe5 wins a pawn). As is, the queen blocks the black knight on g8 from it's only reasonable development and she gains little by way of an attack from e7.} h5 9. Nb5 {Black accomplishes little with his pawn advance to h5, though it could be the beginning of a pawn charge against the castled white king. White makes a simple threat to fork the black king and rook from c7.} d6 10. exd6 {Begins an exchange sequence that will isolate a pawn on d6 for black.} Bxd6 11. Bxd6 {11. Nxd6 would be stronger, giving white the bishop pair advantage. After 11. Nxd6+ cxd6 12. Bb5+ Bc6 13. Bxc6+ Nxc6 14. Qxd6 wins the isolated black pawn on d6.} cxd6 12. Qd2 {It might have been fun to try 12. Nh4?! which is not a good move in and of itself, but if black plays carelessly, such as with a safe-looking developing move such as 12. ... Nf6, white can win at least a pawn with 13. Nxd6+, and if black accepts the sacrifice with 13. Qxd6?? white continues with 14. Bb5+ Ke7 15. Nf5+ Ke6 16. Qxd6+ Kxf5 17. Bd3+ Kg5 18. Qf4#. Black can avoid that checkmate, but he cannot save his queen. The move as played, 12. Qd2, is somewhat passive and allows black to open up the white castle with 12. ... Bxf3.} Bxf3 13. gxf3 h4 14. Be4 {White's king is in a bit of danger. Black is getting close to winning with Qg5+ and h3 and Qg2#. It's not locked yet, but white better take precautions. The move as played, 14. Be4, does little to prevent this impending mate, but it does allow white to play f4 at some time, letting the bishop cover g2. It also threatens black's rook, but with a possible checkmate in sight, black doesn't have to save that rook right away - in fact, he could use it as bait. Worse, while the bishop was on e3 it protected white's far-flung knight at b5, but now it does not, and black has a simple fork to threaten to win that knight (though the need to save his rook on a8 will give the knight time to escape).} Qg5+ 15. Kh1 {Forced.} Rd8 16. Rfg1 {Black needed to save his rook. 15. ... a3 threatens mate, but then 16. Rg1 forces black to save his queen (16. ... Qxb5) but allows white to then play 17. Bxa8, winning the exchange. The move as played, 16. Rg1? deserves a ? for leaving the white knight to die on b5. That knight needed to be saved. Initially, 16. Nxd6+ seems to win a pawn, but now the white knight is pinned to the white queen. 16. Kf8 17. Qb4 to unpin the knight and threaten a discovered check when the knight moves, 17. ... Qe7 threatens the knight twice and pins it to the undefended white queen, 18. Rad1 Rh6 and now white's knight must fall. Accordingly, 16. Nc3 or 16. Nd4 were called for here, or even Nc7+. As a silver lining, the white rook on g1 skewers the black queen to the pawn on g7, and after she moves, white can win the g7 pawn.} Qxb5 17. b3 Nf6 18. Rxg7 {White is only down a piece for two pawns, and has a much better pawn structure (black has three isolated pawns). Black's king is exposed in the center with nowhere to run. All in all, white isn't too badly off despite his slight material deficit.} Nxe4 19. fxe4 Qe5 20. Qd4 {Black found a clever 3-way fork, threatening both white rooks and the pawn at e4, but white found the reply that holds it all together. If black exchanges queens, white replies with exd4 and undoubles his pawns, consolidating his superior pawn structure even more. Still, black is ahead materially, so the queen exchange may be the better move in this situation.} Kf8 21. Rag1 {Black threatened to win the white rook on g7 (21. ... Qxg7 22. Qxg7 Kxg7) but it never would have worked. White defends by bringing his inactive rook into the fray.} Nc6 22. Qd5 {Black threatens white's queen and white responds by pushing her to d5 where she forks the knight on c6 and the pawn on f7. Black only has two choices here, either trade queens or play the passive 22. Qe8.} Ne7 23. Qxf7# {Black played neither. 22. Ne7??? gets the full triple ? and white is obligated to show black the error of his ways. As a side note, for all the movie geeks out there, white's new rating is 1138, a significant number to George Lucas fans, though not one with any chess relevance - the hint is in the game's cryptic title, which is not intended to be the usual texting abbreviation for "thanks". }
