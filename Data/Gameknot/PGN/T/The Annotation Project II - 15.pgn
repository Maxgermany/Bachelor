1. f4 {Opening moves set, move forward to move 8.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 {So the game begins (with me down a queen!)} Bg7 {Locking my dark squared bishop down for the time been.} 10. Ne6 {Want to rid the black bishop and forking it with Queen gives a me chance.} Qg8 {Pressure is there so don't want rush taking the bishop as will lose tempo.} 11. Nc3 Na6 {I suppose if King wasn't there c6 would be prefered square as having knight on the edge limits effectivness.} 12. O-O {Too early?? I don't know. I suppose I wanted protect f pawn & when I rid g7 bishop I can connect Rooks.    ** In hindsight and after talking to Freddy this was too early 12. a3 with a couple of moves thrown in and castling around about move 14 after black had gotten his king safe would have led to a very different game (but lets be honest the outcome would have been the same!!)} h5 {This move made me panic, I looked at the board on and off for 2 days thinking I can't get out of this with out been 5 points down. Losing a piece was my only outcome.   I think this comes from playing a player so far above in the ratings is that one (me) doesn't think clearly.   Anyway just before I was about to click submit I realized I could just...} 13. Bh3 {Would give me a little time... right got to try and think clearly and not look at the numbers...} Nc5 {Ok so the knight is on an attacking square and it looks as if my previous comment about been on c6 was incorrect as the knight couldn't have got to c5 via d7 as a discovered attack and check would have lost piece. Anyway I have 2 options here what I can see: 1. Trade knights; this would leave black with his dark squared bishop but not aid his development & I would gain a pawn. The pawn and knight look as if though they would really cause me a problem going forward. 2. Take the bishop, from what I've read the exchange of knight for the dark squared bishop would be favourable, (although I don't fully understand the deeper reason as to why) but I would lose an active piece and black would left an awkwardly placed knight and passed pawn.  I'm leaning towards the taking the knight... don't know if its correct but I'm sure I'll find out sooner or later.} 14. Nxc5 Bd4+ {Assumed he'd take with the king but the Zwischenzug develops the dreaded dark squared bishop plus it pins my king into the corner...} 15. Kh1 Bxc5 16. Nxe4 {Decide to grab the pawn anyway. Was informed after that rook to e1 was the correct move. Anyway I have my knight in the middle, if I can grab d4 maybe a bit of maneuvering and I can get a discovered check with bishop and win myself a Queen (haha I wish!!!)} g5 {Can't take the bishop with knight as if black passes onto g4 it creates all sort of problems...} 17. fxg5 {coulda shoulda taken with knight?? but then queen has open file to g2. } Rf8 {This could be a problem as my rooks aren't connected.. Queen would mate on f1. } 18. g3 {Protects Rook and hopefully will buy me enough time to get c bishop out... As black doesn't have light squared bishop could be ok.. if blacks rating was a 1500 points lower he may even put queen on d5 pinning knight :)} h4 {Trying to open h file and put pressure on h2 pawn..} 19. g4 {White now totally reacting to black. Double edged sword keeps h file locked although now blocks h3-c8 diagonal(not that its much use anyway!)... Although can drop onto g2 and hopefully get some play later.} Rxf1+ 20. Bxf1 Qf8 {Looking at back row mate.} 21. Be2 {21.bh3,qf7 22.bg2, qd1 spells end for white. bg2 is met with h3 and anything else is mate on f3.  Getting late and I have to be up for work early, Freddy suggests I have a good whiskey and carrot!?!} Qf4 22. d3 {protecting knight, attacking Queen and final attempt to get bishop out. Maybe should have taken Bishop although Knight is my only real developed piece...} Qe5 {Keeps bishop pinned, whites pieces aren't working together at all, a smart move by black and whites empire will come crumbling down...} 23. c3 {looking to get the bishop out and get my rook into defense. with the possibility of a rather obvious & crude fork on d4 to boot.} Bd6 {mate on h2. } 24. Nxd6 {And alas white is now totally exposed. } Qxe2 25. h3 {Delays h3 with queen mating on g2} Qe1+ {So here we go towards the final combination.} 26. Kg2 Qg3+ 27. Kf1 {Trying to last out as long as possible here or at least not give away a stupid mate, but the game has long been over.} exd6 28. Bd2 {At last now my rook can race to defend my king and save the day!!   :/} Rf8+ 29. Ke2 Qf3+ 30. Ke1 Qf1# {There it is folks. I suppose to start off with if I could have gotten to 30 moves I would have been relatively happy. Castling on move 12 proved to be my downfall, rushing to get my king safe. Good game Freddy. }
