1. e4 {Getting close to the end of the tournament. I needed a win from this game to rise into sixth place and to retain a chance of fourth place (if I win my last game as well).} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 {Set opening. White sacrifices a queen for two pieces and the exposure of Black's king. See other annotated games from this tournament for further thoughts on this opening :)} 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 {I choose Kc6 rather than Kc7 as the latter forces Black to lose time avoiding the Ne6+ fork. I have tried Ke8 in two games in this tournament but it turns out to be the worst option of all (apart from the obviously bad Kd6).} 9. Bxg4 e6 {This also has proved to be Black's best option judging by games so far. Black offers the pawn for the chance to catch up on development.} 10. Nc3 {White correctly ignores it and sees to his own development.} Na6 {The standard move, combining development with a threat on c2. Not that I've yet seen why this is such a big deal. But I play it anyway.} 11. Ngxe4 {(?!) White grabs the e4 pawn, which was doomed in any case, but gives up his threat on the e6 pawn and allows Black's queen in at h4. This does not win material, since Nf2 defends the bishop, but it does increase Black's activity and reduce White's.} Qh4+ 12. Nf2 Bd6 13. d3 Nb4 {Now with the queen on h4 (so Kd1 is ruled out as a defence) this move is good.} 14. O-O Nxc2 15. Rb1 Rhf8 16. g3 {As expected: White defends his pawn and drives the queen away. The light-squared diagonal is opened up but Black no longer has the light bishop.} Qe7 17. Bd2 Nb4 {I thought it prudent to get the knight out while I could, with attacks on the a2 and d3 pawns, both currently defended, but keeping them under pressure is still useful.} 18. Rfe1 {Nasty. There's no way to save the pawn on e6. Perhaps 17... Nd4 was better.} Qc7 {Not the best square for the queen, in view of what's about to happen. Perhaps 18... Rae8 19. Rxe8 Qd8.} 19. Rxe6 Rae8 20. Bf3+ Kd7 21. Nb5 {A fork! Now the best Black can do is give up the queen for rook and bishop, with the resulting material difference being an exchange for two pawns, level in terms of points but probably with Black still having the advantage, since White's pawns are still close to home and Black has time to use his piece advantage to try to win pawns.} Rxe6 22. Nxc7 Kxc7 23. a3 Nc6 24. Rc1 Nd4 {The knight finally reaches the square it should have gone to seven moves ago. White cannot avoid an exchange, in view of the threats of Nb3 or Ne2+.} 25. Kg2 Nxf3 {Black naturally prefers to take off the good bishop.} 26. Kxf3 Rfe8 {And now the doubled rooks create the threat of Re2, White no longer having the correct bishop to hold this square.} 27. d4 {I panicked a little when I saw this move, thinking Black had to lose a pawn.} Kb6 {Not so.} 28. dxc5+ Bxc5 29. Rc3 {(?) The final mistake. Perhaps best was 29. Ba5+ Kxa5 30. Rxc5+ and 31. Rc2, when it's not easy for Black to make progress.} Bxf2 {I intended this as a "safety cushion" move -- even if there's some tactic I haven't seen, the best White can get from the position is winning the piece back and remaining down. Then it dawned on me that in fact White has no way to recover the piece. The simple capture leads to the fork Re2+. If White tries checking:} 30. Rb3+ Kc7 {And now 31. Ba5+ b6 spoils the party; the best White can do is get back a pawn, finishing rook for two pawns down. White resigns, and now it all depends on the last game.}
