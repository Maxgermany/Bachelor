[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 c5 {Going into a Sicilian. Not my cup of tea, but we'll trying to make the best of it.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {According to the GK-database, we're playing a Sicilian, Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6).} Nf6 {Heading for an attack on e4.. } 4. d3 Qa5+ {The first "test". In previous days, I would be in major stress, and would play a minor move like 5. c3 or something. But beware, the white-squared bishop is attacked. So the only move to defend both my king and bishop would be 5. Nc3 !} 5. Nc3 {As said.. } Nd4 {Ok, this is some other level then what I'm used to play. Black is taking the initiative as soon as he has the opportunity ! } 6. Bc4 b5 7. Bb3 {The "only" good move.. 7. Bd5 Nxd5 would result in a doubled pawn (8. exd5), because 8. Nxd5 is no option, since it is pinned toward my king, by his queen.} Nxb3 {Sure ! Darknite13 is choosing for a pawn-storm on the queenside. And what's a better way than making a doubled pawn in your opponent's pawn-chain ? } 8. cxb3 {I can't play 8. axb3 because my rook is unprotected. } b4 {Gaining space and place.. See what weaknesses black is making in white's position, just by a queen, a knight and two pawns ! } 9. Ne2 {Probably the best option, although it's not my favourite (a place on c4 would suite the knight well !). Na4 is too passive, and Nb1 is back to start.. But ok, from Nb1, I could play Nd2 -> Nc4 with an outpost on the desired place. But that would cost me 2 moves. Do I have that time ?? } Bb7 10. O-O {This was the best option, I guess.. Doing a developing move (like Be3 for example) wasn't yet the time. King's safety is priority number one.} d5 {Black is showing he has no fear to open up my center. Note how his dark-coloured bishop isn't developed yet, so are his king and rooks. } 11. exd5 {Probably the best move to do.. 11. e5 Nd7  and I would get in trouble by defending that e-pawn. } Nxd5 12. Nf4 {Some room is needed in white's position. So I'm willing to exchange some pieces, to finally have some kind of development.. } e6 {Creating space for the dark-squared bishop. Probably, Bd6 is one of the following moves; taking care of the b8-h2-diagonal. } 13. Nxd5 {Exchanging a piece and, in meanwhile, making room for my only bishop. } Bxd5 {The best move. 13. ... exd5 would eventually block his own bishop, and would allow 14. Re1+, where black should be forced to defend (although for only 1-2 moves, but it would give me a little more time to develop my pieces).} 14. Be3 {As said, doing some development! My pieces aren't really active, so I need to take care of that. Maybe bringing a rook and/or Queen to the c-file..} Bd6 {As predicted.. } 15. Nd2 {Heading for c4. If black should trade of his light-squared bishop for my knight (wich he will not do, imho), I could recapture with b3, so my pawn-structure could become a little bit better as it was before.} O-O 16. Nc4 Qc7 {Heading for my h2-pawn.. } 17. Nxd6 {When your opponent has the two bishops, it's always best to trade one for a knight. The bishop-pair would be way too power-full ! In this way, by trading, we have opposite-coloured-bishops, wich would benefit my drawing-chances in an endgame.} Qxd6 18. Qg4 {A stupid move.. It leads to nothing. Better was 18. Qe2, followed by 19. Rf-c1.} f5 {Sure ! Black has the chance to open a hunt on my Queen, and in meanwhile, he's capturing a lot of space on the board !} 19. Qh3 {Not the best move, but I wanted to be close to my King and the g2-pawn. If black somehow could manage to play e5 and Qg6, the threats were harder to face ! Still, 19. Qe2 would be better.. } f4 {Where should the bishop go to ? Only d2 lasts, since it's best to keep the rooks "connected" to each other.} 20. Bd2 Rf6 {He's heading for a Rg6-move, double-attacking my g2-pawn. See how less spots my Queen has to go to, while black isn't done yet with bringing his pieces into action !} 21. f3 {Again, not the best move.. But it was some sort of idea of me to play Qh4 --> Qf2. In that way, my Queen would be back in the game. } Qe5 {An excellent move !! He's threatening both 22. ... Qxb2, as 22. ... Qe2, giving problems to my bishop and d3-pawn. } 22. Rab1 {Defending the b2-pawn.. } Qd4+ {Perfect ! Nothing I can do to stop him winning my d-pawn.} 23. Kh1 {Maybe 23. Rf2 was better ?} Qxd3 24. Bxf4 {I couldn't see much counter-actions for white, so I decided to give my bishop for some opened-lines. Bad idea, as black showed me..  24. Rf-d1 was still a better move. } Rxf4 {Sure, being ahead in material is always welcome ! } 25. Qg3 {In this way, I was trying to get my Queen back in the game. Hopeless, as we will see.. } Raf8 26. Qf2 {Aiming for some kind of counter-action with Qxc5, although it's no real threat, because black is heavily attacking my king's town !} Rf4xf3 {Giving back some material to open up the railroad to the enemy's king. } 27. gxf3 Rxf3 {As Darknite13 said himself: "This move of mine is a bit of an advanced strategy".  He's totally right.. My position collapses and I would either loose my Queen or being checkmated. There's a wise lesson to be learned ! The following weeks, I should attend more time on strategy, tactics and development !  Thanks Ken, for the patient approach and for the time spending on me and my training  :)}
