1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 {The game begins quietly, with a Three Knights' Game.} d6 4. d4 {White exploits Black's passive third move to take command of the center.} Bg4 5. dxe5 {Forcing Black to concede a minor exchange.} Bxf3 6. Qxf3 {Now the White Queen has a relatively open board to roam on. The consequences will be disastrous for Black.} dxe5 7. Bg5 {Developing aggressively with a pin.} Bb4 8. Rd1 {Forcing Black's response if he wants to avoid losing material.} Qe7 9. Bc4 {Bringing another piece to bear on Black's weakened position.} Nbd7 10. O-O {Now White can attack en masse, with his King safely secure.} Bxc3 {Forced, else 11 N-Q5 would rip open Black's position. Black anticipates 11 PxB in response, as QxB is obviously unsatisfactory -- right?} 11. Qxc3 {Difference of opinion makes horse races... and chess games!} Nxe4 {Anticipating 12 BxQ NxQ 13 PxN KxB 14 BxP, and Black would have a strong game.} 12. Rxd7 {The move Black missed! If 12... NxQ, 13 RxQ ch will be followed up with 14 RxBP ch and 15 PxN. If instead 12... QxR, 13 QxP ch K-B1 14 QxN. And 12 KxR? fails against 13 Q-R3 ch!!, winning Black's Q!} Qxg5 13. Qd3 {Black's position is crumbling fast.} Nd6 {13... N-B4 would fall to 14 BxP ch K-B1 15 Q-QR3 P-QN3 16 RxP!} 14. Rxc7 {Removing the Knight's support.} Rd8 15. f4 {Attacking the Q and gaining another tempo for his attack on the K.} exf4 16. Re1+ {Simple and strong.} Kf8 17. Qxd6+ {Black resigns. If 17... RxQ, 18 RxPch K-N1 19 R-K8 mate.}
