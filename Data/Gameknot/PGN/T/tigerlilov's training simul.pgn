1. e4 {The training simul.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. e5 d5 6. Bb5 Ne4 7. Nxd4 Bd7 8. Bxc6 bxc6 {These are book moves, so no real comment here. By the way, the reason black retakes with the pawn and not the bishop is because he realizes the imbalance of white's kingside majority vs black's queenside majority. Therefore, it makes more sense to get the pawns "rolling" rather than recapturing with a piece and blocking the pawns.} 9. O-O Bc5 {Moves like 9...c5 are bad to 10.Nb3 c6 11.f3 Ng5 12.f4 Ne4 13.f5, when black's position is horrible. The line I give is just one example of the danger of white's kingside majority.} 10. f3 Ng5 11. f4 Ne4 12. Be3 {Also, since the position is not totally closed in the center, we should make our moves towards there rather than on the flanks. Here white has another plan: The pawns of black on the queenside are trying to go forward. White does not want them to do so, and tries to create a bind on the queenside, and then breakthrough on the kingside with the pawn majority after black has no counterplay on the queenside.} O-O 13. Nd2 Nxd2 14. Qxd2 Rb8 15. Nb3 {White's last few moves have realized the plan. Now white has full control and the pawn majority has been halted.} Bb6 16. Qc3 Qe7 {By the way, we are still in theory here. But black's last move was not in my opening preparation. } 17. Rae1 {Now white is preparing some potential on the kingside behind his e and f pawns. As you can see, when doing a plan, there may not just be a single correct move. There are many possible moves that can be made. Another option here was 17.f5, rolling the majority up. In that case, black could respond with 17...Qb4 or Re8.} Bf5 {Loses a pawn, but black has compensation. } 18. Qxc6 Be4 19. Qc3 {Going right back is certainly a fine move, but 19.Nc5, threatening to take off the bishop was a bit better. Either case, white has a nice advantage.} Rfc8 20. Nc5 {Certainly the black move ...c5 cannot be allowed.} Bf5 21. a4 a5 {In this position, black is rather tied up. He has less space, and his pieces are much less active. White is even up a pawn. However, neither player has a direct way to plan. Therefore, white should simply tighten up the position and put the pieces on the best squares. Slow moves, like Kh1 or b3 are perfectly fine.} 22. b3 c6 23. Bd4 Ba7 24. e6 {The black's last move just lost a pawn. Although taking is a possibility, I chose to delay the recapture. The move e6 frees up potential for the rooks on the e file. Also, I first intended the variation 24...fxe6 25.Nxe6?? Bxe6 26.f5, but theres a unpleasant surprise 26...Qf6! and white loses totally. But this move is still good.} fxe6 25. Qxa5 Rba8 26. Qc3 {Going back once again! Anyways, the a pawn is a passed pawn, so white should try to push it up the board. Therefore, Qc3 is the best move. Now, if black is not careful, white will put the rooks behind the a pawnand one to pressure e6, and push it up. } Qc7 {Another pawn is lost, but there is again, partial compensation. Usually this is played only when trying to get counterplay.} 27. Nxe6 Qf7 28. Bxa7 Qxa7+ 29. Qc5 {OK, its a mistake. But I was thinking about simplifying, afraid that black could get active. However, it can't be done, so 29.Nc5 was best.} Bxc2 30. Qxa7 Rxa7 31. Nc5 Rb8 32. Rf3 Bf5 33. h3 Ra5 34. Rc3 {In this endgame, white is winning, since the knight is far superior to the bishop, and there is the extra pawn. The technique is very simple.} Rb4 35. g4 Bg6 36. f5 Bf7 37. Ne6 {Targetting the weak c6 pawn.} Rb6 38. Nd8 {It is good move, which threatens c6 again. Computer likes Kf2 at first, but misses threat of Re7, trapping the bishop. } Ra8 39. Nxc6 Kh8 40. Rec1 h6 {The rest of the game is a "mop up". } 41. Nd4 Kh7 {}
