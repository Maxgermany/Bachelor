1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 {The symmetrical defense to the English Opening, which can lead into a number of transpositions. Both players have to be careful not to miss their way.} 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 {Here Rubinstein should play 5... NxN 6 NPxN P-KN3! transposing into a very solid variation of the Gruenfeld Defense.} Nb4 {He fails to do so and ends up paying a steep price. Now Takacs can exploit the loss of time with the Knight to seize a commanding advantage in development.} 6. Bc4 Nd3+ 7. Ke2 Nxc1+ 8. Rxc1 {Takacs now has four pieces developed to Rubinstein's zero! This will prove fatal to Rubinstein, as Takacs will surge forward before Rubinstein can set his defenses in palce.} a6 9. d4 {Opening useful attacking lines.} cxd4 10. Qxd4 {He does not fear the exchange of Queens, as his Knight will then be beautifully centralized.} Qxd4 11. Nxd4 {With two open files and every one of Rubinstein's pieces still undeveloped, Takacs can smell victory.} e6 12. Na4 {If 12... P-QN4, Takacs has 13 N-N6! R-R2 14 NxB R-B2 15 BxP ch, with an easy win.} Nd7 13. Rhd1 {Activating his last piece and seizing the second open file.} b5 {He has little choice. But even this does not save the game.} 14. Nxe6 {The attack commences. } fxe6 15. Bxe6 {Locking down Rubinstein's King.} bxa4 16. Rxc8+ {Smashing through Black's flimsy defenses.} Rxc8 17. Bxd7+ {Tightening the rope.} Kd8 18. Bf5+ {Leaving Rubinstein without a good move. 18... K-B2 falls to 19 R-B1 ch. } Bd6 19. Bxc8 {Wrapping things up. Rubinstein has a choice of 19... KxB 20 RxB, leaving him 2 Pawns down in a hopeless Rook ending, or his actual move, which leavs him 3 Pawns down in a hopeless Rook and Bishop ending.} Ke7 20. Bxa6 {Rubinstein could, and probably should, have resigned here. However, he plays the game out 12 more moves to salvage some dignity.} Rb8 21. Rb1 g5 22. b3 h5 23. Bd3 a3 24. Bc4 h4 25. h3 Rf8 26. Rd1 Rf4 27. f3 Rf8 28. Rd5 Bf4 29. Kd3 Bc1 30. b4 Rb8 31. Kc3 Kf6 32. b5 {Rubinstein finally bows to the inevitable and resigns. A remarkable attack by Takacs without the Queens on the board!}
