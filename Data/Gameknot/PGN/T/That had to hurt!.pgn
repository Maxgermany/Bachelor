[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Byrne (English) attack"]

1. e4 {My usual, as always.} c5 {And we have a Sicilian for the match.} 2. Nf3 {This is the Open Variation, the most commonly leading into the Dragon, Najdorf or Classical lines.} d6 {This leads into the Dragon-Najdorf lines.} 3. d4 {I'm most comfortable with this. Lately I've been wondering about another varation called the Canal-Sokolsky Attack, where White plays Bb5+ here, usually met by Bd7, Bxd7+, Qxd7, with White having a few options for development on his 5th... But that is an annotation for another time.} cxd4 {This is common.} 4. Nxd4 {And of course, why would you not take the pawn?} Nf6 {Development, and forces White to defend the pawn.} 5. Nc3 {Which I do here. White rarely has to worry about a Bb4 pin in the Sicilian anyway.} a6 {And here we begin the Najdorf variation. The Dragon Variation is more of a defensive line, responding with 5... g6, planning to fianchetto his DSB and to O-O right away. The Najdorf is a lot more aggressive, planning to berate White's knight via e5, but plays a6 in order to stop any of White's pieces from hitting b5...} 6. Be3 {My reply is the English Attack. This is my favorite response to the Sicilian (particularly Najdorf), because I find it preserves White's ability to counter any aggressive moves from Black, while still being able to advance on ground of his own. It also stops Black from moving the Queen to b6 (Qb6? Nb3!), so White's dark bishop becomes particularly powerful in these lines.} e6 {This move frees Black's dark bishop, and allows ...d5 to be a possible move.} 7. f3 {And this prevents an annoying Ng4! after Black plays e5.} b5 {Black decides to start a pawn storm on my knights.} 8. Qd2 {I'm not overly worried about it, so I just continue with my development.} b4 {And he hits my knight.} 9. Na4 {Opening theory normally scolds us for putting knights up against a wall, but this is a good square for the knight, allowing White to contest much of the queenside, and Black must defend carefully.} Nbd7 {Likewise, this move allows development, countering the influence of my Na4, and also allows defense of b4 via Rb8.} 10. O-O-O {I decide now is a good time to castle.} Qa5 {This freezes the Na4 in place, and threatens Qxa2. White cannot play Nc3, and the b4 pawn is further defended from a3 and c3. Now it's White's turn to defend carefully.} 11. b3 {The only real response.} Bb7 {More development for Black, opting to dominate the light squares via d5.} 12. a3 {If the Black Queen has to retreat, it cannot defend b4, allowing me to win the exchange. Meanwhile, Black cannot exchange right now either (bxa3?? Qxa5!!).} d5 {This just dares White to exchange.} 13. e5 {I'm fine, thanks. This forces Ng8, because Nh5 lets White play g4, and the knight falls to the pawns.} Nxe5 {This is a mistake, however- the first of many that spirals Black into a nightmare of mishaps. Black saw that the knight would have to retreat, but didn't understand what made this gambit so dangerous in the first place. Can you see it?} 14. Nxe6 {For starters, the pawn wasn't dropped on e5. Black cannot capture this knight without paying dearly for it. A certain attack is made possible if Black does not give up his pawn on d4 right now...} fxe6 {...Which he does not. My trap now springs into action.} 15. Bb6 {And the door slams shut on the Black Queen's fate.} Qxa4 {A desperate exchange to avoid losing more material in the short term. } 16. bxa4 {Forced on my end. Now I have to figure out how to preserve my material advantage.} bxa3 {I don't like this move, if only because I think Black can do better, like with Nfd7. It forces my bishop to retreat, and I wouldn't be able to play Qxb4 because Black would just play Bxb4. So while I have to be VERY careful about ignoring the pawn nearing promotion right next to my King on a1, I kinda felt, rightfully so, that the threat of a1=Q would not activate before I could advance counterthreats of my own.} 17. Re1 {Starting with the fact that both e5 and e6 have no defenders, and lie in front of the Black King.} Nc6 {Another mistake. This makes my next move even stronger. Much better was Ned7.} 18. Rxe6+ {Being without a Queen, while your enemy has one, means death if your King gets exposed...} Kf7 {Black wanted to shoo the rook away, but I don't care about my rooks this game.} 19. Rxf6+ {Much more important to me is that his king is out in the open for my Queen to harass him with. The fewer defenders he has, the better I'll do with that scale of advantage.} gxf6 {As for this, I see why Black is reluctant to capture with the King, but staying there allows for...} 20. Qxd5+ {This is yet -another- reason why Nc6 should never have been played instead of Ned7.} Kg7 {The only square where I can't force Mate in the next 10 or so moves.} 21. Bc4 {Not that it matters. GK puts me at +14.00 at this point, and Black's moves are pretty much forced to avoid Mate from this position forward.} Be7 {And this wasn't one of them, so we have a fun Mate in 2 coming right up.} 22. Qf7+ {(Drat. That Bishop move would have worked against rooks.)} Kh6 {(Perhaps I'm safer if I go over he- OH CRAP ANOTHER BISHOP AGDRTWDRSTDEW-!)} 23. Be3# {And his King falls. This was a fun and quick game, and I'll be sure to offer him his rematch once my games quiet down a little bit. It's good to be back, GameKnot! Thanks for reading this annotation! :)}
