1. f4 {Having followed the first Annotation Project with interest, I was pleasantly surprised when Freddy invited me to take part in this one. I will start the annotation at move 7 - the starting position. } d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 {So here we go. This is my first attempt at annotating a game. Nxg4 has to be the only option for black here.} 8. Be6+ Kc6 {Kc6 seems favourable to Ke8. d6 just doesn't look right, leaving the king looking more vulnerable in the centre, and restricting the queen. Downside is, the b8 knight is now restricted.} 9. Bxg4 Bg7 {And now I realise just how restricted blacks pieces actually are. It's all very well having a material advantage, but not much help when the material is stuck at home. White has a lead in development, and will probably aim to improve this as quickly as possible. The way I see it, I need to be aiming to swap pieces off. Bg7 activates the bishop, eyeing the b2 pawn and the rook behind, whilst giving my rook and queen a bit more space.} 10. Ne6 Qg8 {My only move to save both queen and bishop. For the time being it seems white will be dictating play. } 11. Nxg7 Qxg7 {At first I thought this exchange was a help to me. White now has just one developed piece and I still have the 3pt advantage. Can I get my remaining pieces out quickly enough? } 12. Nc3 Nd7 {...Na6 doesn't look to give me anything that ...Nd7 doesn't offer. a3 would prevent any thoughts of ...Nb4 and ...Nc2, and the only other square I could reach from there, c5, can be reached from d7 anyway.an I get my remaining pieces out quickly enough?} 13. b4 Nb6 {...Nb6? - This was a mistake. All I've done is restricted my king and pawns, making it difficult to get the king behind the pawns to safety, and it looks as though White is opening routes for rook and bishop. Maybe I should have played ...Na6 last move. } 14. Rb1 e3 {My e pawns aren't too clever anyway, so I'm thinking I may as well use this one to reduce whites queen side majority bearing down on my king. I think maybe ...Rad8 should have been played first though. I considered ...a6 in case of b5+ but taking on b5 would only have allowed whites rook straight into the action.  } 15. b5+ {And, too late, I realise just how bad the situation is! } Kc5 {I have 2 moves, and both allow Ba3+. ...Kd3; Ba3+ ...c5 (only move); bxc6ep+ ...Kxc6 Rb5 and things don't look very pleasant! So, ...Kc5 it is. } 16. Ba3+ Kd4 {And I'm being forced right into enemy territory. } 17. Bb2 {Threatening the discovered check, and the skewer. In fact, with the rook behind the queen too, it probably counts as a whole kebab!  } exd2+ {I thought about ...Nb4 but this is no good due to Ne2+. Double check, and the queen goes. This game is surely lost now. That knight should never have gone to b6. Anyway, ...exd2+ before the d pawn comes forwards denying my king c4 and e4(when the knight moves). } 18. Kf2 {As expected. Whites king remains safe from further potential checks, whilst freeing the h1 rook. } Qf7 {Getting the queen off the dangerous diagonal whilst looking at the f pawn and preventing whites ls bishop getting to the g8-a2 diagonal. } 19. Ne2+ Kc5 {Attempting to get back to safety, though with 2 rampant bishops it's probably a vain hope...} 20. Bd4+ Kd6 21. Be5+ Kc5 22. Nc3 Qc4 {Preventing Ne4+, and getting the queeen into a more active position. Note I have not had a chance to bring a rook into play yet.} 23. Be2 Qxe2+ {Desperate measures. White will now have a material advantage but the immediate potential mating threats have been eliminated.} 24. Kxe2 Nc4 {Nc4?? Having given myself some breathing space, and a slim possibility of a draw, I completely overlook Bxh8......} 25. Bxh8 {Which obviously white will capitalise on. Down the exchange, my d-pawn is easy for white to deal with. Time to resign. Thanks for the game Steve, and for a harsh introduction to an interesting position.}
