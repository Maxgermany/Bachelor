1. e4 {....myself and the buddy are playing some recent games and this is one of those where if you rush or don't pay attention, you get screwed. This game was played relatively quickly and the number of mistakes on both side is silly...but amusing....} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 e6 6. d3 c6 7. Bd2 {....all developmental stuff out of a Scandanavian opening...not even sure if this is right....} Qc7 8. Bg5 Nbd7 9. Qd2 {..decided i was going to ignore normal chess practice and castle queen side for a king side pawn storm...} Bd6 10. O-O-O b5 11. Bb3 Nc5 {...well this is where i thought i was going to cause structural damage to Black with the following move.....} 12. Bxf6 {...sure what could be wrong with it....gxf6....laughing...no worries....er...Hold on....ERRGGG !! is that a .......} Bf4 {SKEWER.....!!! oh for fffffffff......so i decided to take the pawn and 2 pieces for the queen....seeing as i have no choice...!!} 13. Bxg7 Bxd2+ 14. Nxd2 Rg8 15. Bd4 {...blacks pieces are not devloped with is a help but i am still struggling...} Nb7 16. g3 Nd6 17. Nde4 {...i am figuring activity with the minor pieces will make him work for the win...his king is stuck and that white bishop is useless so i am material up in effect. All pieces are in game and if i get Rhe1 then its not comfy for black after f4 and f5...} Rg6 18. Nf6+ {...making space for the other knight to bring him in...} Ke7 19. Nxh7 {...take material when safe to do so !!!} Bb7 20. Bc5 {..a pin to prepare f4/5 and Rhe1} Rh8 21. Ne4 {...i can let him take the knight as after Bxd6  its back to a reasonable game for white and 2 pawns up !} Rd8 22. f4 f5 23. Nxd6 Rxd6 24. Rhe1 {using the pin to gain time..will take the exchange shortly...} Kf7 25. Ng5+ {...hold on...are we seeing a come back...?} Rxg5 {..maybe forced as lots of pressure on e6} 26. fxg5 Bc8 27. Bxd6 Qxd6 28. Re2 Kg6 29. Rde1 {...Hey....I'm up material in effect...??!!} Kxg5 30. Bxe6 Bxe6 31. Re2xe6 {...well its nasty for Black now...h4/5/6/7 is coming..} Qd5 32. a3 Qa2 33. h4+ {...h5 or Rg6  to follow...} Kh5 34. Re1e5 {...i think the buddy had enough but i have a strong position now..he can pick up a & b pawns but with only a queen i think i can defend...}
