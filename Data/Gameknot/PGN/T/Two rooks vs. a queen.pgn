[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence, 4.O-O"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez, or Spanish game. White's idea behind the attack is to weaken Black's defense of its e5 pawn and possibly damage Black's queen-side pawn structure.} Nf6 {The Berlin Defense.} 4. O-O Nd4 {Black enters a rare line of the Ruy Lopez.} 5. Nxd4 exd4 {This trade leaves Black with doubled pawns on the d-file. The d4 pawn will be hard to defend.} 6. d3 c6 7. Bc4 {The c4 square is a more active position than a4 and helps protect d5.} d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. Nd2 Be6 {Slightly better is Be7 to prepare for castling. The d5 knight is already defended by Black's queen and c6 pawn.} 10. Nf3 {Attacking Black's undefended d4 pawn.} b5 {Indirectly defending the d4 pawn.} 11. Bxd5 Qxd5 12. Re1 {Pinning Black's light-squared bishop.} h6 {This move deprives White of the important g5 square. From this square, White could have attacked Black's pinned bishop and traded, leaving Black with an isolated e-pawn.} 13. b3 {Preparing to push the c2 pawn forward; but, more importantly, preparing to fianchetto White's bishop on b2 attacking Black's d-pawn.} Bb4 14. Re5 {White moves the attacked rook to an excellent central square and forces Black's queen to a less active position.} Qd7 15. Bb2 {Attacking Black's weak d4 pawn.} Bc3 {Black can't defend the d-pawn with 15. c5?, because after 15...a3 16. Ba5 Rxc5!, Black loses his c-pawn and his d-pawn will soon fall too.} 16. Bxc3 dxc3 {Black's c-pawn is undefendable and will soon be captured.} 17. Qe1 b4 18. a3 bxa3 19. Rxa3 Qd6 20. Ra1 O-O 21. Qxc3 {White is now a full pawn ahead. Black has two isolated pawns, which will become huge weaknesses in the upcoming endgame.} Bd5 {Black's bishop attacks White's knight, threatening to trade and leave White with doubled pawns.} 22. Qd4 {White pins Black's bishop against his queen.} f6 23. Rh5 {Perhaps e3 was a better square for White's rook.} Rfd8 {Black creates a battery and unpins his bishop.} 24. Qe3 {White gets out of the way of Black's battery, defends his knight, and attacks Black's a7 pawn.} Rde8 {Black attacks White's queen, trying to force it away from the defense of his knight. Black may then trade his bishop for White's knight and leave White with a weakened king-side pawn structure. However, Black misses an important tactic.} 25. Rxa7 {This is the turning point in the game. White takes a second pawn and a decisive lead. White also offers a trade of his queen for Black's two rooks.} Rxe3 {Black decides to trade. I think better would have been 25...Rxa7 26. Qxe8+ Kh7 27. Qe1 (to prevent ...Ra1+) Bxf3 28. gxf3 Ra2, giving White doubled pawns on the f-file and putting Black's rook in a powerful position on White's 2nd rank.} 26. Rxa8+ {With check, so White can win Black's second rook.} Re8 {The correct move, giving Black a chance to activate his king.} 27. Rxe8+ Kf7 28. Re3 {Maintaining defense of White's knight. White doesn't want doubled pawns, which would give Black a weakness to exploit.} Qc5 29. c4 g6 {? This move leaves Black's h-pawn hanging. Black needs all of his pawns to fight for the draw.} 30. Rxh6 Kg7 31. Rh3 Bf7 32. d4 Qa3 33. g4 {This move gives White's king a place to go if it gets checked by Black's queen.} g5 34. Nd2 {? This move defends White's b-pawn and connects his rooks, but it leaves the defense of the d4 pawn.} Qa1+ {! Black forks White's queen and d-pawn.} 35. Nf1 Qxd4 {Black lessens White's advantage.} 36. Rhg3 {Prepares h3.} Bg6 37. Re2 Kf7 {Black activates his king, although it will be hard to go anywhere with White's rook on the e-file.} 38. Rd2 {The next few moves shuffles White's pieces around as he begins to push his king-side pawns.} Qe4 {Black must move his queen out of the line of fire.} 39. h3 Qe6 40. Re3 Qc8 {Black must move his queen again.} 41. Ng3 {All of White's pieces are protected. Black's queen has resorted to moving aimlessly around the board. His king is blocked off from the queen-side. His bishop has no active squares to move to.} Qb7 42. Ne2 {White prepares to push his f-pawn.} f5 43. Red3 {White creates a battery with his two rooks. Black's king and queen are lined up along the same rank; Black must meet the threat of 44. Rd7+.} Ke7 44. Re3+ {White forces Black's king back.} Kf7 45. f4 fxg4 46. hxg4 gxf4 47. Nxf4 {White now has a passed pawn on the king-side and a potential passer on the queen-side. More importantly, Black has significantly compromised his king's safety.} Qb6 48. Kf2 Be4 {White cannot capture because his rook is pinned. This doesn't matter, however, because White's bishop presents no threat.} 49. Ke2 Bh1 50. Rd7+ {White begins a series of checks that drive Black's king into a corner.} Kf6 {Black must come down to avoid checkmate.} 51. Nh5+ Kg5 52. Rg7+ Kh4 {Black's king is forced into the side of the board.} 53. Nf6 Bg2 {Black's bishop still can't do anything.} 54. Rh7+ Kg5 55. Nd7 Qd4 56. Re5+ Kf4 57. Rf7+ Kg3 {Black's king is forced into the corner.} 58. Re3+ Kh2 59. Rfe7 {White doubles his rooks, but leaves his g-pawn hanging.} Qxg4+ {Black captures with check.} 60. Kd2 Qd4+ 61. Kc2 Qf4 62. Kc3 Qf5 {Notice how White's rooks completely dominate Black's queen. Black can make no progress.} 63. b4 Qb1 64. Re3e1 Qf5 65. Ne5 Qf6 66. Rf7 Qh4 67. Re2 {White pins Black's bishop.} Qg3+ 68. Nf3+ {White relieves the check on his king while checking the enemy king. Black's king is in a precarious position, smothered by it's own pieces.} Kh1 {After 68...Kh3 69. Rh7+ Kg4 70. Rg7+ Kxf3 71. Rxg3+ Kxg3+ 72. Rxg2+ Kxg2, only the kings and pawns remain. Black's king is too far away to save his pawn, and White will make a queen and win the game.} 69. Re1+ {Black's king has no moves.} Qxe1+ {After 69...Bf1 70. Rxf1+ Kg1 (...Qg1 71. Rxg1#) 71. Rg1+ Kf2 72. Rxg3 Kxg3, Black has lost a bishop and a queen for only a rook. Better is to lose only a queen for a rook.} 70. Nxe1 {White is up a rook and a pawn. Black's position is hopeless.} Be4 71. Rg7 c5 72. b5 {White now has a passed pawn.} Bg2 {? Black gives up by leaving his bishop hanging.} 73. Nxg2 {Here Black resigned.  Black's opening structural weaknesses gave White an early lead. White gained a clear advantage when Black traded his rooks for White's queen. White's rooks, supported by his king and knight, were able to completely dominate Black's queen and bishop while keeping Black's king far from the action on the queen-side. Black's position became hopeless when he traded off his king-side pawn protection, allowing White to force his king into the corner.}
