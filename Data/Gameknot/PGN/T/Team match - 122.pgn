1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {Bishop opening} Qf6 {It is not wise to move with the queen into the open board so early in the game. Theory recommends 2... Nf6 and black equalize pretty soon.} 3. Nf3 Bc5 4. O-O Qg6 {???? a huge mistake. black leaves the e5  pawn and loses the f7 pawn afterwards. 4... d6 with Bg4 later on was inquired.} 5. Nxe5 {obviously} Qg5 {in this poor situation I think 5... Qb6 was a slight better.} 6. Nxf7 Qg6 {why? White takes the rook and the queen will still be threatened...} 7. Nxh8 Qg5 8. d4 {white is practically won. 8. Bxg8 works too.} Qe7 9. dxc5 Nf6 10. Bg5 {it's somehow amazing. black didn't develop any piece... at all...} Qf8 11. Nf7 d5 12. Bxf6 Kxf7 13. Qxd5+ Be6 {mate in 3} 14. Qxe6+ Kg6 15. Qf5+ Kh6 16. Qg5# {}
