1. e4 {my standard e4 opening} e5 {typical response} 2. Nc3 {vienna!} Nf6 {vienna game} 3. Bc4 {my typical capablanca styled variation} Be7 {seen this before, allows immediate castling} 4. Nf3 {best to develop} d6 {protects center pawn} 5. Ng5 {attack to force castling, avoids pin for a move or two} O-O {castle} 6. O-O {best to do so as well} h6 {chasing me back into the pin} 7. Nf3 {retreating into it} Be6 {no pin?} 8. Bxe6 {ok i'll get that pin possibility destroyed} fxe6 {doubled pawns up the center, poor decision in the longrun likely} 9. d4 {taking the center} exd4 {exchange} 10. Nxd4 {knights in the center, not advanatage but controls} Qd7 {doulbing to push, this isn't fun, should of seen that by opening the center i'd undouble him} 11. Nf3 {retreating?} Nc6 {taking the center back and preparing for d5 followed by d4} 12. Be3 {good i finally spotted i had troulbe coming} a6 {not doubling?} 13. Nd4 {taking back the center} Nxd4 {recapture} 14. Bxd4 {better not good still though } e5 {taking the other half of the center} 15. Be3 {retreat} Ng4 {radically annoying, personally i'm getting really lucky} 16. Bd2 {retreat don't want to rip myself apart} b5 {pawn push} 17. h3 {chainsg the knight away} Nf6 {retreat} 18. Qe2 {2nd protector} Qe6 {ok, why not b4?} 19. b4 {stopping the pawn adavance dead in it's tracks still could do d5 though and i'm through} c5 {reattacking, not pleasant} 20. bxc5 {recapture} dxc5 {recapture} 21. a3 {stops the advance and makes it a better position} c4 {well i spaced that} 22. Qe3 {ok i'm going to double mine now i guess?} Nd7 {oh i see i was setting up for Qg3, he just stopped it dead though} 23. Nd5 {advance and threatening a fork of rook and queen} Bd8 {he spots it of course} 24. Bb4 {another attack, balancing the position more} Rf7 {saving the rook} 25. Qg3 {trying to do something?We agree to a draw at this point. not much able to be gotten from this.good game rajko. I missed a mile here and so did he. a draw is probably very good here. until next time this is The Metal Gator rocking out}
