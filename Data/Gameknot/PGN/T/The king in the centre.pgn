1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 {Good responce but black look's are in trouble} 3. Qh5 {Going for scholar's mate} g6 {A very bad move, Nh6 was better but I still win the e5 pawn} 4. Qxe5+ {Yes, a fork} Be7 {But not a very good responce} 5. Qxh8 {Whopee, six points up} Kf8 {Fine} 6. d4 {You can see what I'm up to, or can you?} d6 {That stops mate in 3 but it doesn't fit well in development. White is winning anyway.} 7. Bh6+ {Even though the knight can take me, it's pinned to the king, so it can't.} Ke8 {So now you know why I said d6/d5 foiled my plan. Now there's an escape square for the king.} 8. Qxg8+ {But who cares.} Kd7 {Who want's an exchange of queens when white's this powerful. Of course not. So I end up..} 9. Qxf7 {...just taking the pawn.} Nc6 {Fine} 10. Bg5 {The bishop is pinned twice. Once by the queen on f7, pinning it to its king, and the bishop and g5, pinning it to its queen. The world of pins arrive. And the king can't move.} Nxd4 {Bad move as it loses protection on the bishop.} 11. Nc3 {Devolping there.} b6 {Blunder.} 12. Nb5 {See, as I can scoop on the risk of Nxb5, Bxb5+ check and its not good.} Nxc2+ {Oh, but my rook is'nt powerful yet.} 13. Kd1 Nxa1 {Good, the knight's gone away.} 14. Be6+ {Getting the king out to the centre.} Kc6 15. Nd4+ Kb7 16. Bd5+ {A funny skewer.} Kb8 17. Bxe7 {Good, and fine.} Qh8 18. Nc6+ {Now I check} Kb7 19. Na5+ {A double check} Ka6 20. Bc4+ {Another one.} Kxa5 21. Qd5+ {Another crafty fork.} Kb4 {Out and about.} 22. a3+ {Mate in 2} Ka4 23. Qb5# {Checkmate. A very funny mate.}
