1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez} a6 {Exchange Variation} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. h3 {Hmm, I'm not sure this is great, but I don't think it's terrible.} Bd6 {Development.} 6. O-O Be6 7. d3 Nf6 {I believe black has the edge here due to white's slow development.} 8. c4 {?! He really needs to develop.} O-O 9. Nc3 {Finally} Re8 10. Bg5 h6 11. Bxf6 {?! I'm not sure I would have done that... It trades a bishop for a knight and develops my queen.} Qxf6 12. b3 Bb4 {Black is significantly better.} 13. Qd2 Qg6 {Threatens Bxh3.} 14. a3 {??} Bxh3 {! He can't take my bishop or it's mate.} 15. Nh4 Qg4 16. f3 Bc5+ 17. Kh2 Qxh4 18. gxh3 Re6 {Well that skirmish dies down and leaves me with a slight advantage, but nothing unassailable. White should try to take control of the g file.} 19. b4 Bd4 20. Qg2 {?? He should have moved his rook to g1, this allows me to take control of the g file with tempo... Not to mention, it leaves a knight hanging.} Bxc3 21. Rfg1 Rg6 22. Qc2 Qf4+ {Pushing his king into a corner.} 23. Kh1 Bxa1 {I really didn't see any alternatives. If white wants to recapture then he surrenders the g file.} 24. Qh2 {I think he made the right decision not recapturing, but I think he should have traded rooks. It would have relieved the pressure down the g file...} Qxf3+ {...And it also allows this.} 25. Rg2 Bd4 {!} 26. c5 Qf1+ 27. Rg1 Rxg1+ 28. Qxg1 Qxg1# {And I get checkmate. I'm only five points away from 1300, a never-before-seen rating, I hope I can make it there.}
