[Opening "King's Indian (E91), 6.Be2"]

1. d4 {Queen's pawn opening} Nf6 {Queen's pawn game} 2. c4 g6 {Now King's Indian defense.  Rather than challenge W's control of the middle of the board with 2. e6, B allows W control of the middle, for now.} 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 {W obliges} d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {Making a little room and trying to deploy some pieces.} c5 7. d5 {7. dxc5 does nothing, but 7. d5 keeps W's pawn structure intact in the middle of the board, and provides a bit of a block for B's queen side knight and bishop.} Na6 {Gameknot calls this an inaccuracy and prefers 7. e6, but I don't really see why this is worse at this point.} 8. O-O Rb8 9. e5 {Putting pressure on B's knight and I expect dxe5.} Nd7 {Instead B moves Nd7, which GK again calls an inaccuracy, preferring dxe5.  Thie difference seems to be who ends up with control of the middle after a long series of moves.} 10. Bg5 {GK calls this a mistake, preferring 10. exd6.  This makes sense as W loses a pawn for no good reason at e5.  If W had moved 10. exd6 then B moves exd6 and W can move Nb5, threatening the unprotected pawn at d6.} Nxe5 11. Re1 Bg4 {Again, GK calls this a mistake because eventually, with the optimum series of moves for each player W ends up with an advantage pressuring the pawn at e7, which if B wants to defend then leaves the pawn at b7 vulnerable.} 12. Nxe5 Bxe2 13. Nxf7 {This move makes up for my lost pawn, I expect B to make the Queen trade.} Rxf7 14. Qxe2 {Rxf7 slightly increases my score according the post-game analysis and Qxe2 slightly decreases it again - not sure why.} Bd4 {GK isn't a huge fan of Bd4 either, but it does create a bit of an obstacle for W later.} 15. Bxe7 Qd7 16. Bh4 {W must retreat here with 16. Bh4 to cover f2, which is suddenly becoming an important square.  } Rbf8 {B marshalling reinforcements, W is getting nervous about f2, but no need to panic yet.} 17. Ne4 {Ne4 helps calm W} Nc7 18. Red1 {GK doesn't like 18. Red1.  This is because this could eventually leave the knight at e4 unprotected and break up W's king's defenses.  Post-game analysis prefers 18. Bg3, which threatens the pawn at d6 and keeps the initiative with W.  } Ne8 {GK calls this an inaccuracy, presumably because b5 would have begun to wreck W's control of the middle of the board and eventually threaten the knight at e4.} 19. Rab1 Ng7 20. b4 Nf5 21. Ng5 {Post-game analysis calls 21. Ng5 a mistake because it eventaully leads to W's defenses being opened up whereas 21. Bg5 leads to B's king's pawns being extended and an advantage at b4, with the optimum turn of events per GK's post-game analysis} Re7 {Re7 is a strong move for B.  W has an unprotected bishop in danger and now must protect the queen.} 22. Ne6 {GK says this is actually not a very good move.} Nxh4 {W's bishop was already dead but now W poses a choice to B.  Some pieces are going to fall, B decides which.} 23. Nxf8 Rxe2 {GK calls this a "blunder".  It seems to me that the essence of B's mistake here is that B would have been better off keeping the queen and continuing the attack, plus B goes down in material value as well, whereas if B had taken the knight with the king it would have been even.  After the queen trade, it seems like B can keep W on the ropes, but the attack actually falters quickly.} 24. Nxd7 Rxf2 {It seems B felt that the lost points could be made up by breaking up W's defenses.} 25. bxc5 {W wants that bishop at d4, but B can keep the king dancing a little while longer.} Rxg2+ 26. Kh1 {Kf1 wouldn't have been as good, even though generally I am wary of putting the king in a corner.  In this case Kh1 avoids putting the W king at B's mercy and a potential eventual checkmate by the knight.} dxc5 27. Rxb7 {Now W's attack is on, and it is a stronger attack than what B is able to muster at this point.} Rxa2 {Rxa2 protects a7 but W has options.} 28. Re1 {Threatening the back-row 'mate, eventually.} Nf3 {Nf3 seals it.  Threatening the rook at e1 doesn't accomplish much, even as an attempt to open up W's back row to attack the king...} 29. Nf6+ {...because Nf6+ paves the way for 'mate.  Either way B moves the king Re8 finishes the game, same if B moves Bxf6.}
