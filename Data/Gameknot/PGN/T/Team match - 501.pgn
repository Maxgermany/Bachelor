1. g3 {I used to play this opening so it is fairly familiar stuff.} d5 {You don't play e5 here as it gives white the developing Nf3.} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. Nf3 {This opening is quite disconcerting to most people since white can mostly ignore black and use the same setup.} g6 {I thought that I'd mirror the financhetto structure.} 5. Bg5 {This is the first divergence from the book (the normal move is 0-0)} Bg7 6. Nc3 O-O {I carried on with the ignore the opponent trick.} 7. Ne5 h6 {Now I need to get the bishop out of the way to prevent the queen from backing it up.} 8. Bxf6 exf6 {I now have a very strong pawn flank and a useful open file.} 9. Nxc6 bxc6 {Notice my use of doubled pawns.} 10. Na4 f5 11. Nc5 Qf6 12. c3 f4 {This is an attempt to break up the fianchetto structure} 13. O-O fxg3 14. fxg3 Qe7 15. Re1 Qe3+ 16. Kh1 f5 {GK recommends Rb8 here} 17. Qd3 Qxd3 18. exd3 a5 19. Re7 Rb8 20. b3 h5 21. Rae1 {Doubled rooks should be more intimidating.} f4 22. gxf4 Bf5 23. Rxc7 Rbc8 24. Rxc8 Bxc8 25. a3 Rxf4 26. Re8+ Rf8 27. Rxf8+ Kxf8 28. h4 Ke7 29. Kh2 Kf6 30. Kg3 Bh6 31. Kf3 Bg4+ {Here I get a little carried away with the power of the paired bishops.} 32. Kf2 Bf4 33. Nb7 g5 34. hxg5+ Kxg5 {My plan here was to force through the h pawn. I did'nt expect it to take so long.} 35. Nxa5 Bd2 36. Nxc6 Be6 37. c4 dxc4 38. dxc4 {W has such a strong pawn wall that I should have been destroyed by it.} Kf4 39. d5 Be3+ 40. Ke2 Bg4+ {W } 41. Kf1 h4 42. Ne7 {W's reluctance to just push those 4 passed pawns was his undoing.} h3 {Here I was taking a risk: if white was not so adverse to non-favorable exchanges he could have won the game by taking my last pawn.} 43. Ng6+ Kg5 {More wasted chances to advance his pawns!} 44. Be4 h2 45. d6 Bh3+ 46. Ke2 Bc5 47. b4 Bxd6 48. c5 Bc7 49. Kf2 Bf5 {Now I start to get back into control. My passed pawn is so close to home the the bishop can't leave the h1-a8 diagonal.} 50. Bd5 Kxg6 {I win the knight (but probably should have used the bishop)} 51. a4 {Finally the pawn advance - just when it is too late.} Kf6 52. a5 Ke5 53. Bg2 Bd3 {Now it is almost all over for white.  His pawns can't make it to the 8th.} 54. Ke3 Bc4 55. Kf2 {The king attempts to assist in the blocking of the pawn, allowing B's king to feast on the pawns.} Kd4 {There is no saving the pawns.} 56. Bf3 Kc3 {I was expecting black to get his king into h1.} 57. Bb7 Kxb4 {Black now has a dilemma: how to stop the h pawn from queening and keep the pawns.} 58. a6 Bxa6 {This is the true use of a sacrifice.} 59. c6 h1=Q {The pawn finally becomes a queen.} 60. Bxa6 {.. at the cost of a bishop.} Qxc6 {GK informs me that this is not actually required as I had a forced mate in 7. I preferred the safety net of not having to worry about that last pawn.} 61. Be2 Kc3 62. Bf3 {A valiant, if pointless attack.} Qf6 {Slowly reducing B's options.} 63. Kg2 Qg5+ {Here W is limited by a series of forced mates (64. Kh3 Qg3#,  64. Kh1 Qg3 65 B moves Qh2#) } 64. Kf2 Kd2 {Here I chose to close in the box. W's king will never move outside of f1 or f2} 65. Be2 Qg3+ 66. Kf1 Bb6 67. Bd1 {A valiant attempt to get a draw should I capture the bishop.} Qf2# {All in all a lucky escape from what I should have lost.}
