1. d4 {Here is my 2nd annotated game. Since a couple of months I'm trying to play the KI-defence. This game is a nice example that, if black chooses for the setup d6-c6-Qc7-e5, white should never take on e5 with his d pawn. That gives black at least equality. Enjoy..} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Nf3 O-O 5. e3 {Not the most active move, but playable. } d6 6. Bd2 c6 7. Bd3 Qc7 {I rather play the lines with Nc6, but in view of e3, played on whites 5th move, the d4 pawn is supported well, and there is no use in increasing the pressure on that square. } 8. O-O e5 {e5 =} 9. dxe5 {dxe5 ?!  That move gives black an easy game. Blacks position is slightly better. Because white played c4 already, this pawn won't be able to defend the d4 and b4 squares. In many variations white can gain a usefull tempo, by attacking that pawn with Be6.} dxe5 10. e4 {And now e4.. So e3 proved to be a waste of a tempo. It's obvious that after only 10 moves black has won the opening, but how to take more significant advantage? } Nbd7 {The Nbd7-c5-e6 manouvre looks very promising, taking absoulte control over the d4 square.} 11. Re1 Nc5 12. Bc2 Ne6 13. h3 {White's having trouble to find a good plan.} Rd8 {Meanwhile, black has all the time in the world to activate his pieces.} 14. Qc1 {Qe2 wasn't much better in view of Nd4..and now Nxd4  exd4 forces the c3-knight to take a very passive position. } Nd4 {The time has come to "jump in"} 15. Bd1 {Trying to keep his white squared bishop, and save his pawn structure, after Nxf3} Be6 {One would say that the black position is playing itself now.} 16. b3 Nd7 {Avoiding the pin after Bg5. Now black can easily answer f6 and then focus on preparing f5.} 17. Ne2 {A bad move. I can understand that white wants to get rid of the annoying rock on d4, but now he's losing even quicker.  } Nxf3+ 18. gxf3 Bxh3 19. Ng3 {Here I discovered a nice way to penetrate the white position using the black squares, wich are to become weak very soon. } Nf8 20. Bh6 Ne6 {The exchange of bishops is not in white's favour since the white bishop is more active than his counterpart. } 21. Kh2 Nf4 {Nf4! the quickest way to win. The next 7 moves are forced. } 22. Bxf4 exf4 23. Rb1 fxg3+ 24. Kxh3 gxf2 25. Rf1 Be5 {Be5! Thats what I had in mind when I played 19.. Nf8} 26. Rxf2 Bf4 {Cuts out all the white pieces, and leaves their king exposed to an attack he cannot survive. } 27. Qc3 {Also forced since white cannot give black the opportunity to play Qe5, and switch quickly to the kings side. } Qe7 {There are many ways to Rome. } 28. Kg2 {If white tries to defend with Rg2, then Qc5 is killing because of the threat Qh5.} Qh4 29. Bc2 {Nothing else helps to prevent Qh2, Kf1, Qh1, Ke2 and Rd2, when white is forced to give the queen for a rook  bishop. } Bg3 {Bg3!  And the game is over.} 30. Qe1 {Moving the rook away would lose quickly as well.  Re2 leads to a mate in 2, after Qh2, Kf1, Qh1.. and Rd2 loses the queen after Rxe2 Qxe2 Qh2. } Bxf2 31. Qxf2 Qxf2+ {After Kxf2 white is a rook down, because Rd2 wins the bishop. So he resigned. }
