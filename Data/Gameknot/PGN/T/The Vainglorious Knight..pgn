1. d4 {This was one of 6 Gameknot games I played simultaneously with my opponent. I lost two, drew 3 and won this. Some of those draws were very lucky, when my opponent kindly offered me a draw although I was a clear pawn down in a couple of them. In this game he loses as one of his knights goes out on a solo run to win a pawn, but ends up losing itself for two pawns. I manage to convert a lead of a knight for two pawns into a win - but we both make a lot os mistakes along the way!} Nf6 2. Nc3 {In a couple of games he had beaten me very quickly and very easily with the Blackmarâ€“Diemer Gambit, after 1. d4 Nf6, 2. Nc3 d5 3.e4. I wanted to try and find out what he would play against it himself.} c5 {But instead he transposes into a Benoni. This version of the Benoni is considered better for white however, as the normal c2-c4 has not been played. the square c4 is available for a knight or bishop.} 3. d5 e6 {g6, d6 and e5 are all more common at this point.} 4. e4 {I reinforce my centre. } d6 {He prevents the d5-d6 push.} 5. Bg5 {I'm following the Gameknot opening databases as usual!} Be7 {He develops.} 6. Bb5+ {I throw in a check.} Bd7 {He blocks.} 7. dxe6 {I take.} fxe6 {He takes back.} 8. Bxd7+ {I exchange bishops.} Nbxd7 {He takes back. Interestingly on the World database taking back with the queen is the only move given. Taking with the knight can hardly be bad surely?} 9. Nge2 {As played in longtail99 (1922) vs. sualksnh (2472), in a tournament called "Play the Trompowsky Attack!" so obviously with a different move order.} a6 {That game continued with Ne5 instead of a6. a6 is given as a mistake by the Post Match Computer Analysis (PMCA).} 10. a4 {So this is the first move I did entirely off my own bat. PMCA says it is a mistake and prefers Nf4! Oh well.....} Ne5 {So this move comes in at last.} 11. f4 {So I hit the knight.} Neg4 {And of it goes, on a solo adventure from which it will never come back.} 12. h3 {I hit the knight.} Ne3 {Knight comes in.} 13. Qd3 {I prevent the knight escaping to c4.} Nxg2+ {He takes the pawn.} 14. Kf2 {I hit the knight, which finds it has no escape squares.} Nxf4 {So it takes a pawn} 15. Bxf4 {and I take the knight. I am knight for two pawns up now.} e5 {Attacking the bishop, but making his d5 square weak and his d6 pawn backward.} 16. Be3 {I retreat.} O-O {He castles.} 17. Kg2 {I move my king to a safer square.} Qe8 {He prepares to use his queen against my king.} 18. Kh2 {So I move it again. I actually will have lovely open f and g files against his king, and more crucially there is just one open file, the f file, on which I have excellent chances of exchanging off rooks. Of course, being materially up, I want to exchange off pieces, but not pawns...} Qh5 {The queen comes out.} 19. Rhg1 {I prevent the knight check.} Kh8 {He moves his king to a safer square.} 20. Raf1 {I mobilise my other rook.} Ng4+ {This check is actually a horrible mistake. I thought "I can't play 21. Rxg4 as then he can play Rxf1". However I missed 22. Ng3, forking queen and rook, so winning the rook back. I think I missed this, because I was a bit in awe of my opponent, who had beaten me in one game, and was winning in a couple of others, and it just didn't occur to me that he might accidently throw away another knight!} 21. Kg2 {But hey, I'm still winning surely?} Nxe3+ {Piece exchanges favour me, and his bishop and two pawns are certainly not worth my two knights. d5 is going to be a tremendous square for one of them soon, surely?} 22. Qxe3 {So I take back.} Bg5 {He hits my queen.} 23. Qg3 {Queen comes across.} Qh6 {Preparing Bf4, but it only results in more piece exchanges.} 24. Rxf8+ {So I trade rooks.} Rxf8 {He recaptures.} 25. Rf1 {I contest the open file.} Rxf1 {He takes.} 26. Kxf1 {I keep my queen on the f4 square.} Bf4 {This doesn't actually achieve anything, just allows more exchanges, which favours me.} 27. Nxf4 {Computer says this is a mistake, and Qg4 was better. Maybe, but this is simpler.} exf4 {Computer prefers the queen recapture, but that allows me to exchange queens, and simple win in the ending.} 28. Qg4 {So now I do play Qg4} g5 {He has to make a flight square for his king.} 29. Qc8+ {I throw in a queen check.} Kg7 {Forced!} 30. Qxb7+ {Now only one pawn for the knight.} Kf6 {His king comes up.} 31. Nd5+ {Knight finally reaches d5.} Ke5 {Not Ke6, Qe7 mate!} 32. Qe7+ {So I check.} Kd4 {King up again.} 33. Qf6+ {Computer says this is a mistake, but I think it is by far the easier way to win.} Qxf6 {So he takes.} 34. Nxf6 {I take back, hitting the h pawn.} h6 {Pawn advances.} 35. Ng8 {Ne8 also wins, but this is better. I need to go after his potentially strong kingside pawns.} h5 {He saves his h pawn.} 36. Nf6 {I attack it again. At this point we did a deal, at my suggestion. He resigned this, and in return I resigned a game where I was 2 pawns down without any compensation. I was a bit surprised at his resignation comment. "I think I could draw this with good play...but as you insist I'll resign". I tend to disagree, I think this position is pretty hopeless for black. He has only one pawn for the knight. He is losing one of his kingside pawns for my e pawn. My king easily blocks his passed f pawn. My knight can quickly and easily jump from the queenside to the kingside, as necessary. But I'd be interested in your view near reader! So please leave a comment or two, and please rate it on the star system.}
