1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Spanish.} d6 {This move blocks the black bishop but It always turns out ok.} 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 Bd7 6. Nxc6 Bxc6 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 8. O-O Be7 9. Nc3 Nf6 10. Be3 c5 11. f3 {This move was ok. But it wasn't that necessary. f4 is more creative.} O-O 12. Qd2 Rb8 {Taking advantage of the open flange.} 13. b3 Nd7 {Opening way for f5.} 14. Nd5 f5 {As I said earlier, more creative.} 15. Nxe7+ {An unnecessary exchange I would assume.} Qxe7 16. Bg5 Qe5 17. Bf4 Qf6 18. Qd5+ Kh8 19. Qc6 fxe4 {A less obvious move but in effect opening a flange where black has 2 attacking pieces. Of course, the queen is in front but is in no danger yet.} 20. fxe4 Qd4+ {Attacking 34 while isolating f Rook from King.} 21. Kh1 Nf6 {Double attack on pawn. Actually a much better move would have been Rxf4, but only saw it afterward.} 22. Rae1 Rbe8 23. Qxc7 {Big mistake to leave so many pieces attacking with less defense from white's queen} Nxe4 24. Bg3 Nf2+ {I took some time before this move. Not so obviously good} 25. Bxf2 Qxf2 {Now it's clear. A rather normal situation turned into a lethal attack.} 26. h3 Rxe1 {Pin means black gains rook...} 27. Rxe1 Qxe1+ 28. Kh2 Qe5+ 29. Kg1 Re8 {White queen is completely out of the game. 23. Qxc7 was clearly a bad move.} 30. Qxa7 Qg3 {}
