[Opening "QGD Slav (D15), 4.Nc3"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 {The Slav seems to be popular these days.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Qc2 {6.Bd3 is more popular, but I prefer to play 6.Qc2 first, which forces black to come up with a useful move, since now 6...dxc4 7.Bxc4 and white gains a tempo on the usual line, as the bishop has only moved once to recapture on c4. } Be7 {I think this is "?!"  The bishop belongs on the b8-h2 diagonal, so 6...Bd6 is preferred.} 7. Bd3 dxc4 8. Bxc4 O-O {It's hard to call this a mistake, but in this opening, black really needs to get the Q-side going with ...b5 and ...b4.} 9. O-O Qc7 {Again missing the opportunity to play ...b5 and ...b4.  } 10. e4 {Black's lack of counter-play gives white a free hand in the center. } e5 {Pretty much forced; white is threatening e5 followed by Bd3 with a nasty K-side attack.} 11. h3 {Preparing Be3 by restricting black's N on f6.} exd4 12. Nb5 Qb6 {Of course not 12...cxb5 13.Bxf7+ and black can resign.} 13. Nbxd4 Ne5 14. Bb3 Nxf3+ 15. Nxf3 Qc5 16. Qe2 {White has a space advantage, and therefore wants to keep as many pieces on the board as possible.} Qh5 {Trying to drum up some counter-play ...} 17. Bg5 {But now white sees an opportunity to bottle up the black Q.} h6 18. Bxf6 Bxf6 19. e5 Be7 20. Bc2 {Black's queen is running out of squares.  } Be6 21. Rad1 Rad8 22. Qe4 {Threatening mate ...} g6 23. Qe3 Bd5 {I was expecting 23...Bg5 24.Nxg5 Qxg5 25.f4 Qe7, with a plus to white because of the space advantage.  Note that 23...Bxa2? simply loses the B to 24.b3. This bishop really should stay on the c8-h3 diagonal.} 24. Rxd5 {With this bishop gone, white has a serious threat of Kh2 followed by g4, winning the black queen. } cxd5 {24...Rxd5 is not much better after 25.Kh2 Bc5 26.Qe1 f5 (all pretty much forced) 27.Bb3. } 25. Kh2 Bg5 26. Qd4 f5 {The only way to stop g4. But now black's queen is out of the game. } 27. Qxa7 Rfe8 {27... Ra8 28.Qxb8 Rxa2? 29.Qxd5+ wins } 28. Qxb7 Bf4+ 29. Kg1 Bxe5 {Better is 39...g5, getting the Q back into the game.} 30. Ba4 {White now regains material, and has two healthy outside passers.  Black is lost. } Re6 31. Nxe5 Rxe5 32. Qc7 Rde8 33. Bxe8 Rxe8 34. Qc6 Re7 {The d-pawn is a goner.  If 34...Re5 white wins the pawn anyway with 35.Qc8+ Kf7 36.Qd7 Re7 37.Qxd5 } 35. Qxd5+ Kh7 36. b4 Qe2 {Finally getting back into the game, but it's too late ...} 37. b5 f4 38. a4 Qc2 39. a5 {The pawns can't be stopped without shedding more material. }
