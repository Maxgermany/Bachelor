1. d4 {A move slightly less popular than 1. e4 at lower levels of play, but still very meritorious.  Objectively, as good as if not stronger than 1. e4, as these postitions tend to produce a longer lasting initiative for white.  This move is the most popular at the top levels of chess play.} d5 {Symmetrical.  This gives black similar pluses to white, though white still has the move (and thereby initiative) to boast of: Queen gains two spaces, Queen's bishop gains a diagonal, and e4 or e5, the most direct ways for white or black to take the center, are denied.} 2. Nc3 {A slightly weak move.  The C-pawn is a tremendously important pawn in queen pawn (d4) openings.  2. c4, 2. e3, 2. Nf3. 2. c3 all look like more active options.  The Knight cannot take the pawn, even if it were white's move again, because the queen defends it and probably will defend it for a while.  This move deserves a ?! (slight mistake) in my opinion, but probably should lead to = (equality) as white has/had the move edge.} Nf6 {Some might think: "Hey, you called white's move passive.  Now you're DEFENDING a pawn you said yourself would be safe by the queen for a while??  That seems just as passive, if not more so, than white's move!" But in fact, there's much more to this move than that.  I do not block the important c-pawn with my knight.  Rather, I block the f-pawn, which probably shouldn't move immediately anyway (that weak diagonal can kill many a good king if opened).  I defend a pawn that's already defended, yes, but there's more to it than that. 1) I am one step closer to an early kingside castle.  If I play a moves like 3. e6 or 3. g6, followed by 4. Be7 (Bb4) or 4. Bg7, I could then castle at move 5. 2) In a strange way, I do need to defend my d5 pawn if I am to play a specific Queen's pawn opening.  Consider 2....c5.  If I try this reversed Queen's Gambit of sorts, I see I lose two pawns, and probably the game after 2...c5 3. dxc5 e5 4. Qxd5.  It is clear that my d-pawn is not, in fact, defended sufficiently in this course of play. 3) In an even stranger continuation that I sometimes like to play as white, I am preparing e5 with this move.  The idea there would be to play at some point in some order c6, Nd7, e6, Bd6, and finally e5.  This is very slow play and often times I opt for more active lines, but it is a powerful idea.  If/when I force white to recapture on e5, my knight jumps powerfully into play and reveals, as black, my light-square bishop.  This is a perfectly fine idea.  In any event, the merits of this move as compared to those of white's can be summed up as my knight being involved in a variety of possible plans, allowing a prompt castle, and not blocking my c-pawn.  It is important to have such a general idea in even (especially!) opening positions, as these are forseeable and can prevent early disasters.} 3. Bf4 {Controlling e5 and making Bd6 somewhat less appetizing.  White looks to be preparing for a queenside castle.  This move is fine} Bf5 {Responds in kind, commandeering the e4 square} 4. e3 {A powerful move.  Secures d4 and clears a path for the light-square bishop.  Note, the dark square bishop would be bad (meaning white's own pawns would inhibit its mobility) but by being outside of the structure, the bishop is actually quite good.  This is an important idea used in many openings.} a6 {This move could be considered a slight blunder (?!) because it is slow, but I didn't like the idea of my knight being pinned by Bb5, which would be pesky.  Playing a6 and then b5 later didn't seem very good.  Somehow, I was still trying for e5, I think, with my Nc6 defending it.  I believe an immediate Nc6 or e6 were better tries as they would have been more active.} 5. Bd3 {Not bad.  Doubled pawns are given a worse rep than they deserve.  In fact, doubled e- or d-pawns are very powerful controlers of the center.  And the center, as the most direct route for all areas of play, is of paramount importance.} Bxd3 {An OK move.  I give white more control of the center, but doubled pawns, if not dealt with, can become a serious weakness.  Also, I did not lose tempo by retreating.} 6. cxd3 {Objectively, about as strong as Qxd3, though most people would prefer to gain a tempo in that way.  This move can be very potent if white takes the half-open c-file with a rock or two and possibly his queen, and if white builds up a strong center.} e6 {? (Blunder).  This move is outright bad.  Nc6 and g6 would have been much better, as this move makes 4....a6 an undeniable waste of tempo.  It is not catastrophic, but it is a slight error in judgment.  Now e5, if played at all, will take two tempii instead of the more natural one.} 7. Be5 {? I cannot help but think that this was meant to prevent g6, which I would not do after e6 anyway, but even at this strange task it would fail, as my queen defends the knight in the meanwhile of the two moves it would take to get my bishop fianchettoed at g7.  Wastes a tempo (or gives my a6 tempo back) by moving a developed piece more than once.} Nbd7 {Attacks the newly vulnerable bishop.  Though both worth roughly three, the bishop is thought to be slightly more valuable than the knight, and I am usually happy to trade knight for bishop.  } 8. a3 {Same idea as my 4...a6.  It stops my bishop from actively pinning his knight.  Better would have been to develop queen or knight and castle, or at least move rook to the half-open c-file.  This allows me to win a small gain of bishop for knight, an edge I use all the way until the end of the game.  The main reasons a bishop is preferred to a knight are basically two-fold (though this is a highly simplified explanation): 1) Bishops can defend or attack the same square if they are attacked, by retreating along that diagonal, while knights cannot, as they alternate from light to dark squares. 2) Bishops can move long distances more quickly, an advantage not to be underestimated in the end game especially. Knights do have some merits, namely: 1) Knights can jump over pieces, giving them tremendous flexibility, especially in a closed opening or middle-game.   2) they can attack both colored squares, whereas bishops are forever stuck on one (light or dark). Still, bishops are objectively viewed as slightly better than knights in most situations} Nxe5 {And I will take that slight edge} 9. dxe5 {obviously} Nd7 {Attacks that pawn, which is still doubled!  I was hoping to lock the pawn structure by seeing an advance of 9. d4, which would trap his pawns on dark squares where my bishop could harass them, but the reply was better than that.  Still, my knight was attacked and this move was fine} 10. Nf3 {A good move.  Defends the pawn, which is actually quite powerfully in my territory, and develops, ready for castling.  } Be7 {Develops to castle as well} 11. d4 {!? (Interesting move).  Perhaps the immediate castle was better, as that keeps most flexibility, but closing a game makes knights stronger than bishops, making my slight edge a weakness for a bit} O-O {castling is a good way to connect rook} 12. O-O {And my opponent knows this} c5 {I had to develop my queen and this was the fastest way.  Nb6 was possible, but not exciting.  Here, I attack a pawn, begging to trade pawns so I can develop a knight or a bishop.} 13. b3 {And here, Rc1 or Qc2 would have been very powerful.  Rc1 may have won the game for white.  Still, the position is relatively even and this move restricts my pawn.  OK} f6 {Exchanging on d4 changes nothing, so I hope to bust open this game and make my bishop better than his knight} 14. exf6 {He obliges} Bxf6 {I am ecstatic to be rid of that strangling pawn on e5 and to get my bishop out of its hole.  Nf6 was also possible, but now I have an x-ray attack on the undefended knight at c3 and then the rook behind it} 15. Na4 {Now the pawn is all that stops me from taking the rook.  However, my opponent has threatened my pawn on c5, so I should respond.....} Rc8 {!!  Both of my rooks occupy half-open files.  This is very powerful.  My opponent should have taken the c-file long ago.  Now, I can use the files to my advantage.  Or so I hope} 16. Rc1 {! Finally contends the half-open file and, conveniently, moves out of the path of my bishop.  Fine move} Qe7 {Defends the pawn, which was attacked three times, and defended twice.  This is prefered to Be7 as moving the queen connects my rooks and makes it slightly more active.  e7 is preferred for the queen here (as compared to c7) because at c7, the rook could potentially attack my queen (more x-rays).} 17. dxc5 {weak.  Opens up the game for my bishop without provocation} Nxc5 {In case the knight retakes, this keeps material equal} 18. Nxc5 {and he does} Rxc5 {Obviously not with the queen..} 19. Rxc5 {Simplification.  The game is roughly even, with a slight edge to black} Qxc5 {Of course} 20. b4 {This does defend the a3 pawn (which was attacked) and is objectively the best move.} Qc3 {I continue to attack the pawn} 21. Qc1 {?! He defends, but evidently misses my reply.  To truly defend the pawn, only Qa4 would have worked, and that is an awkward place for his queen (as compared to my powerfully placed queen).  If 21. Qa4, the game is roughly even.  With this move, I win the pawn, and eventually the game.  } Rc8 {I attack the queen more times than it is defended.  It must flee} 22. Qb1 {Not much choice..} Qxa3 {Mmm...yummy pawn} 23. Re1 {? Of course, Rc1, the move he would love to play, is blocked by my queen and rook, but this move just doesn't make sense.  Some plan would have been better than this random move.  Maybe Nd2, trying to get the knight into play, or Rd1 to support Nd4 or such} Bc3 {Brings my bishop quickly, as talked about, into the game} 24. Rc1 {And white gets to play his move.  My bishop is pinned.} Rc4 {But that's easily fixed} 25. Ng5 {Attacks my e-pawn, and I cannot reach it} g6 {? I cannot remember why.  Bad move.  Much better is 25...Bxb4 or Rxb4 or Qxb4 or even e5} 26. Nxe6 {Why not? Free pawn.   White hangs on for hope as my extra pawn, the d-pawn, is isolated} Bxb4 {Oh sure. NOW I take it.  My b-pawn looks to be exiting soon, stage right, unless I can get b5 in} 27. Rxc4 {???? The losing move.  White let's me win the game.  I assumed white's idea was to lure me farther from my king and closer to his, where the king can meet with the queen and knight and attack the pawn more times than my Queen and bishop can defend it.  Sounds like a good plan} dxc4 {But I spot a flaw...} 28. Nd4 {Hoping to bring my pawn close to his king} b5 {!!!! Good night, ladies and gentlemen, I win the game} 29. Kf1 {Keeps on with his plan..} Bd6 {Attacks the new weakness} 30. g3 {defends} Kf7 {Moves closer to the queenside action} 31. Ke2 Be5 {Finally willing to exchange knight for bishop, knowing I can easily win this endgame.  My 3 queenside pawns are all unopposed, and this is much more important than his 4-2 majority on the kingside} 32. Nf3 {Refuses to trade.  Attacks my bishop instead} Qb2+ {With check, so I can trade queens.  } 33. Qxb2 Bxb2 34. Kd2 {still hoping to win my pawns somehow.  Interestingly, the game could have been closer if 34. Nf5  Kg7, but I believe I still could and should have won} h6 {? Pointless, but it's a meaningless mistake.  Somehow, scared of Nf5} 35. Kc2 {attacks bishop} Bf6 {Retreats} 36. Nd2 {? No hope left. } Ke6 {I see the path to victory involves my king on the queenside with my bishop stopping any kingside ideas.  That e-pawn could be dangerous...No need to take risks at this point} 37. f4 {Pushes his kingside majority} Kd5 {Forcing my pawns forward} 38. g4 a5 39. Kb1 {? At this point, resignation seems to be the best option.  The game is straightforward from here} b4 40. Ka2 a4 41. h3 Be7 42. f5 gxf5 43. gxf5 c3 44. Nf3 b3+ 45. Kb1 a3 46. Ne1 Ke4 {0-1}
