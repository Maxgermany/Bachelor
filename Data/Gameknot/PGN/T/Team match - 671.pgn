1. c4 {This was another team game. I tend to play the English opening against similar standard players.} Nf6 {If white now plays Nc3..he can wait and see if black goes into a KID or Grunfeld type set up....} 2. g3 e6 {..decided to go this route as it leads to QID or Slav replies from black when e6 is played} 3. Bg2 d5 4. Nf3 b6 5. O-O Nbd7 6. d4 Bb7 7. cxd5 Bxd5 8. Nc3 Be7 {...i think black should have retreated the bishop ...afterall..this now puts a hole into the queenside...} 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. e4 {I gain a tempo also....} Nd5f6 11. d5 {..with the king in the centre and with the strong possibility of freeing the white bishop...I thought of the push to d5 rather than e5..} e5 12. Nh4 g6 13. Bh6 {...black makes a mistake here ...i can keep the king in the centre and if they go 0-0-0, there is a gap to probe....} Nxe4 {...black has the tactic to open the kingside via the next moves..} 14. Bxe4 Bxh4 15. Bg7 {..but with this move stops 0-0 and has the nice follow up move to prevent black 0-0-0..} Rg8 16. d6 {..sweet...this is a huge pawn and will be a terminal pain really quickly...} Rc8 17. dxc7 Qg5 18. Rc1 {..supporting the pawn...} Nc5 {.considering the position of the king, even though the black bishop is en prise, it provides  a nasty source of pain for the black king. The d file is out of bounds, Bc6 is mate in two..so just have to remove the guardian...} 19. Rxc5 {...black cant take the rook in view of Bc6  Ke7 and Qd7#} Rxg7 20. Qd6 {..blocking the escape square and providing the continued threat....} Qe7 {..only retreating move but now the rook comes in...} 21. Rxe5 {..white will win the exchange but blacks position is lost anyway...} Kf8 22. Rxe7 Bxe7 23. Qd7 Rxc7 24. Qxc7 {..white is a queen up...and not going to lose it from here...! Was watching a DVD by GM Peter Wells & in it covered interposing moves..i think 15.Bg7 was an unexpected option for black to deal with...assuming i had to take..}
