[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 {1. e4 often leads to open games, characterized by pawn exchanges in the center and freedom of movement for the pieces.  Notice that two lines have been opened already, one for the bishop on f1 and one for the queen.} c5 {The Sicilian defense.  Only one line is opened (for the queen) and black may fall behind in development.  The main idea is to trade a wing pawn (black's c-pawn) for a center pawn (white's d-pawn).  The reasoning is that the extra center pawn will allow black to eventually control the center.} 2. Nf3 {Developing towards the center.  This move paves the way towards early castling, and increases white's chances of controlling the center.} g6 {The fianchetto (wing development) of the bishop caught many classic players off guard.  At first glance it doesn't seem to have any centralizing effect.  However, the bishop is going to move to g7, where it will strike at the center squares on d4 and e5.  It is fairly difficult to challenge this bishop, and the fianchetto has proven a tough nut to crack.  This variation of the Sicilian is called the Accelerated Dragon.} 3. d4 {Immediately challenging the center.  The great Danish player Larsen called this a strategic mistake, but most theorists consider this the most promising way to challenge black's intentions.} cxd4 {Black has achieved his initial goal of captuing white's d-pawn with the c-pawn.} 4. Nxd4 {At first glance White seems to have an advantage both in development and space.  Generally, such an advantage would prompt you to initiate an attack.  It is too early to do so now, and the challenge wll be to preserve this advantage while completing the rest of white's development. } Nc6 {Black challenges the control over d4 and e5.  Notice that 5. Nxc6 plays into blacks hands.  After 5. ...bxc6 black is no longer behind in development, has a sound pawn structure and better prospects for long term control over the center.} 5. c4 {Establishing the Maroczy bind, named after the great Hungarian master of old.  White is trying to prevent black from ever playing d7-d5.  White will maintain an advantage in space, but the extra pawn move allows black to start catching up in development.} Nf6 {Developing towards the center.  Note that 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. e5 fails to 7. ...Qa5 .} 6. Nc3 {Developing towards the center and protecting the e-pawn.  Now, 7. Nxc6 and 8. e5 is threatened.} d6 {Black spends a tempo (one unit of time) to defend against that threat.} 7. Be2 {White wants to complete his development, and 7. Be2 prepares castling.} Nxd4 {An important refinement over 7. ...Bg7.  Black wants to force white's queen onto the d4 square where it will later be harrassed by black's bishop on g7.} 8. Qxd4 {Reestablishing material equilibrium.} Bg7 {Black intends to castle, complete his development and only then strike out at white's center.} 9. Be3 {White usually plays the bishop to e3 or g5 in order to have the d2 square available for the queen.} O-O {Now, Black threatens 10. ...Ng4 with a double attack (on white's queen and on the bishop on e3.)  White does not want to exchange the dark square bishop for the knight.  That would leave the bishop on g7 as the best minor piece on the board.} 10. Qd1 {More usual is 10. Qd2, although the text is by all means playable.  White may have wanted to get out of the well known lines and go down a side path.} Be6 {Typically, black tries for counter play on the queenside.  The bishop develops towards the center and attacks white's c-pawn.} 11. Bd4 {White doesn't mind trading the dark square bishops, because that takes much of the sting out of black's setup.  11. 0-0 is another good alternative.} Qa5 {Black wants to clear the back rank and connect his rooks.  One of the interesting things about the geometry of the chessboard, is that moving the queen to the edge, also activates it in the center.  Do you see how from a5, the queen attacks the key central squares d5 and e5, as well as the less crucial but still important squares c5 and f5?} 12. O-O {White has maintained his advantage in space, but is now lagging a bit in development.  Black must try to take advantage of this soon or risk drifting into passivity.} Rfc8 {Which rook belongs on the c-file?  Black is hoping to open more lines on the queenside, so leaves the rook on a8 where it is for now, and activates the other rook.} 13. b3 {Securing the c-pawn, but it also represents an additional weakening of the dark squares in whites center and queenside.  White is counting on the bishop on d4 to compensate.} a6 {Black would love to be able to play b7-b5 at some point, and a6 increases his chances of doing so.} 14. f4 {14. Nd5 is also promising.  White is increasing his spatial advantage.} Rab8 {Again, with an eye towards an eventual b7-b5.} 15. Qd3 {A move with multiple purposes.  It provides additional suppoprt to the knight on c3, discourages b7-b5 and assists f4-f5.  The f4-f5 push is the usual plan in these types of positions.} Bd7 {Probably not best.  Black is still thinking about b7-b5.  15. ...Ne8 was more prudent, and 15. ...b7-b5 more thematic.  In the latter line black sacrifices a pawn for piece activity, hoping to win it back under more favorable circumstances.} 16. e5 {A good aggressive continuation taking advantage of white's edge in space.} Bf5 {Redeploying the bishop to a more active post with tempo.} 17. Qe3 {Getting out of harms way and keeping the pressure on.} dxe5 {This capture is virtually forced.} 18. Qxe5 {This was came as a surprise and was a big relief.  18. fxe5 keeps the pressure on and even 18. Bxe5 was to be preferred.  When you have an edge in space, generally speaking, you should avoid exchanges.  When you are cramped seek them out.} Qxe5 {Black is very happy to get the queens off of the board.} 19. Bxe5 {White may have underestimated the small combination at black's disposal in this position.} Ng4 {Finally exploiting the weakened dark squares.} 20. Bxg7 {20. Bxb8 Bxc3 is fairly level.  Notice that white can't play 21. Rac1 because of 21. ...Bd4  and 22. ...Rxb8. - } Kxg7 {After the exchanges any spatially advantage for white is much less important.  White's advantage in the endgame now shifts to a 3 on 2 pawn majority on the queenside.  Both sides will want to create a passed pawn, but only white's will be an outside passed pawn, which means the pawn will be on the other side of the board from the kings, and therefore more difficult to stop.} 21. Nd5 {A logical move advancing into black's position with the threat of capturing the e-pawn.} Rce8 {Pawns cannot move backwards.  21. ...e6 would restrict the bishop's mobility.} 22. h3 {I think 22. Rfe1 is an improvement.  The threat is to simply capture on g4 and then on e7.  This would force e7-e6, which would be a concession on black's part.} Nf6 {Black has just about equalized now.  Most of the endgames are fairly balanced.} 23. Ne3 {The knight is far less worrisome on e3 than on d5, but white is unable to maintain it there.} Be4 {When feasible always try to control the long diagonal (in this case the h1-a8 diagonal.)} 24. Rad1 {There is only one open file, so the rooks naturally will oppose one another, leading to additional exchanges.} Rbd8 {Black cannot allow white to control the only open file.  Howver, there is no immediate penetration square, so black could've played a move like 24. ...h5, as well.} 25. g4 {It would be better to expand on the queenside with 25. a3 and then b3-b4.  You want to play on the side where you have the advantage.  White might as well waste no time trying to create an outside passed pawn.} Bc6 {Staying on the long diagonal and freeing up the e4 square for the knight.} 26. Rxd8 {The posiiton is essentially even.  White decides to swap rooks, which is niether good nor bad.  It's just a different type of endgame.} Rxd8 27. Rd1 {Continuing with the exchange of rooks.} Rxd1+ {Black is happy to oblige.  The only danger was ceding control of the d-file to white and that is no longer an issue.} 28. Bxd1 {BIshop vs. knight endings can be quite thorny.  The two pieces don't really work too well with one another.  Straight bishop or straight knight ending are usually clearer.} Ne4 {If I had to do it over again, I'd probably throw in 28. ...h6 first.} 29. Bf3 {There is a tactical problem with this move which we both over looked.} e6 {Instead 29. ...Nc3 wins a pawn.  White will lose the a-pawn or after 30. ...Ne2 , the f-pawn.  Knights are tricky!} 30. Nc2 {White now has a fairly solid plus, because he can meet 30. ...Nc3 with 31. Bxc6 bxc6 32. Nb4!  Always stay alert for your chances, because they may not last more than one move long.} b6 {Flustered, black makes a mistake.  30. ..Nc3 was still the best move.} 31. Nd4 {We should both be kicking ourselves.  31. Nb4 is most likely winning.  If 31. ...Bb7 32. Nxa6!} Bb7 {After mutual mistakes the game is once again fairly level.} 32. a4 {32. g5 might be better, which is why I later decided that 28. ...h6 would've been an improvement for black.} Kf6 {32. ...h6 is still better.  While 32. ...a5 might be the best move of them all.} 33. b4 {33. g5  is another reasonable try.  White is on the right path at last trying to create an outside passed pawn.} Ke7 {Either 33. ...h6 or 33. ...g5 was better.  Black is allowing white to hold his 4 pawns back with white's three.  An elementary mistake.} 34. Nb3 {White has all the chances in the position.} Nd6 {34. ...h6 was still better!} 35. Bxb7 {It might be better to keep the bishop on the board with 35. Be2.} Nxb7 {Forced.} 36. Kf2 {Or 36. g5.  White is now trying to activate his king.} a5 {A mistake.  36. ...h6 still holds the game.  I thought about playing this move, and I can't say why I never played it.  Strange!} 37. b5 {What a shame.  37. c5! is winning.  37. ...bxc5 38. bxa5!  Threatening 39. a6.  Black must play 38. ...Nd6 allowing 39. Nxc5 with a winning endgame.  37. bxa5 is also much better for white.} Kd6 {With just one move, white has not only thrown away the win, but also the game.  Now, black is probably winning.  However, 37. ...h6 was STILL better!} 38. Ke3 {38. g5 was the last chance.} Nc5 {Now, black's advantage is clear.} 39. Nxc5 {The knight ending is also lost, but the king and pawn ending is easier for black to play.} Kxc5 {King and pawn endings are all about passed pawns and king position.} 40. Kd3 Kb4 {Another blunder!  40. ...f6 is a trivial win.} 41. Kd4 {This is all I considered at the time, but 41. g5 is winning for white!  If 41. ...Kxa4 42. Kc3!  Black has no moves!  42. ...Ka3 43. c5 creates the passed pawn and the win.  Unreal!} Kxa4 {Now black is winning AGAIN!} 42. Kc3 f6 {Finally.} 43. h4 h6 {White will be helpless to stop black's passed pawns.  What a shaky game for both of us!  The ending was very tactical, and we were both on autopilot.  Endings are the most neglected aspect of chess.  Time spent studying endings pays dividends in the opening and middlegame as well.}
