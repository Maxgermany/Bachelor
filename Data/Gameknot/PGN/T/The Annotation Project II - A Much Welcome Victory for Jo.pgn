1. f4 {Hi everyone!  I know some of you think I take my rating too seriously.  I must plead guilty to that.  For a long, long, time, ever since that Battle of the Wings game against Coach Ion I have harboured dreams of getting to Expertdom.  Well, I got as far as 1857 before Black Friday which put me back to 1809.  Fortunately, due to several timeouts from a 1950+ opponent and this victory I still manage to stay in the 1800s, although there are some losses just around the corner.  I must confess that though I have been trying to get my games level down I was invited to a mini-tournament where an IM was playing in it.  It is not very often I get a chance to play someone at that level so I joined the MT along with Freddy's Traxler MT.  Because that MT contains fast players I really am struggling, but I have only myself to blame.  So, this victory helps take the pressure off just that little bit .....} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e5 {9. ...... e5 - we pick up the action from here.  So far Bg7 has been found to be an improvement on this move and I will play it the next time I have black but for now at least things work out OK here.} 10. O-O Bc5+ {10. ....... Bc5+ - development with check gaining useful tempo.} 11. Kh1 Qe7 12. Nc3 exf4 13. Ngxe4 {13. Ngxe4 - pawn trade.} Na6 {13. ........ Na6 - aiming to clear the decks.} 14. d3 g5 15. a3 h5 {15. ...... h5 - driving back white's lsb and attempting a pawn storm on the kingside.  This is how far those pawns get, however.} 16. Be2 Bd4 17. b4 Bxc3 18. Nxc3 {18. Nxc3 - B for N trade.} Kd7 19. Bb2 Rh6 {19. ....... Rh6 - averting a discovery along the a1-h8 diagonal.} 20. Rae1 Qh7 21. Bf3 c6 {21. ....... c6 - screening off white's lsb attack on my b7 pawn and preparing a hidey hole on c7 for Henry.} 22. Be4 Qg8 23. b5 Nc5 {23. ....... Nc5 - improving the position of my knight.} 24. bxc6+ bxc6 {24. ...... bxc6 - pawn trade.} 25. Bf5+ Ne6 26. Ne4 Qf8 {26. ....... Qf8 - I see a possible knight fork on f6 but I am prepared to give up my rook for this pesky horsie.  Dmaestro's dsb will go into the bargain.} 27. Nf6+ Rxf6 28. Bxf6 Qxf6 29. Bxe6+ Kc7 {29. ....... Kc7 - I could have played QxB here but although material would have been even, white would have had a clear edge, given the position of my rook stuck on a8.} 30. Bb3 Rd8 {20. ...... Rd8 - develops rook at long last and this rook will be used to provide some cover for Henry.} 31. Re6 Qg7 32. Rfe1 Qc3 {32. ....... Qc3 - Glenda does not wish to be caught up in Re7+ so she makes a little nest for herself on c3.  She defends the weak c6 pawn and dissuades dmaestro from moving his e6 rook off the e file.} 33. Kg1 {33. Kg1 - trying to avoid any possibility of back row mate.} Qc5+ 34. Kf1 Qxa3 {34. ...... Qxa3 - Glenda snatches off the a3 pawn giving me an isolated passer on the a column.} 35. Re1e5 Qc1+ {35. ...... Qc1+ - Glenda decides to be a nuisance on the back row.  This check at least temporarily diverts dmaestro's e5 rook away from my kingside pawns.  If dmaestro moves his king I may hassle him further with checks from my good Witch of the North.  Indeed, her proximity to the WK gives dmaestro the heebie-jeebies, so much so that he waves the white flag.  Ah well, that's my fourth victory in the Annotation Pt. 2 mini-tournament.}
