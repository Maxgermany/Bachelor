Nf3 {White controls a big amount of squarest on the queenside} Ne4 {menacing the DSB} 9. Rc1 d6 {gaining some control on e5 and closing the a3 f8 diagonal for white's DSB} 10. Bd3 {To fire the knight} Nd7 11. O-O {Developpement almost completed.} f5 12. Bxe4 fxe4 {This trade seems good for black because I advanced the f pawn and the LSB could have been dangerous on the a2 g8 diagonal further in the fame} 13. Nd2 {White is strongly established on the center but his kingside will be hard to defend.} Qg5 {Black's plan is to send all the pieces on attack on the kingside} 14. Qa4 Nf6 {following the plan} 15. c5 d5 {To launch a powerfull kingside attack, black has to close the center first.} 16. c6 Bc8 {Black's LSB seem to be blocked (and blocks the a rook as well)} 17. g3 {Doubtfull move : it weakens the king and black has still the LSB available to pass between the pawns} Qh6 {To menace an attack on h2 via a further Ng4} 18. h4 {Preventing the attack on h2 but weakening the king} Ng4 {unmasking the f rook. Black's plan is to double the rooks on the semi open f file.} 19. Qd1 {The black knight has to retreat} e5 {Protecting the knight, freeing the LSB at the price of a pawn} 20. dxe5 Be6 {The center is definitely blocked and most of black pieces are aiming at the white king.} 21. Qe2 {Protecting the f pawn and giving mobility to the white queen.} Qg6 {So that the black knight has a retreating place on h6} 22. Kh1 {To make a place for the f rook} Rf7 {intending to double the rooks} 23. Bd4 {To prevent a further Nxe3 fxe3 Qxg3      and to open the c file for the rook.} Nh6 {The g4 square could be a good spot to settle a bishop Now that white has plaid Bd4, a further Nxe3 is not tion anylonger.} 24. Rfg1 {setting a rook in front of the queen} Raf8 {Now, all of the black pieces are directed toward the white king. The attack can be launched at the first opportunity.} 25. Rg2 {preventing 26. Rxf2 but setting a rook on a white square and black has a LSB available} Bg4 {Launching the attack} 26. Qb5 {Menacing the d5 pawn} Qe6 {Protecting d5 and setting the queen on the h3 c8 diagonal.} 27. Kg1 {King on a dark square protecting the f2 pawn.} Bf3 {Time to launch the attack} 28. Nxf3 {logical move} Rf7xf3 {The rook is safe there as white has no more LSB and no more knight} 29. Rc2 {defending d2 but this let the first line without defense.} Kh8 {Black plans to move his queen and to let the d7 pawn unprotected. At least if Qxd7, the black king won't be in check.} 30. Qa6 {It creates a menace on a7.} Qh3 {Launching the attack. If 31. Rh2 Rxg3 32. fxg3 Qxg3+ 33. Rg2 Qe1+ 34. Kh2 (forced move) Qh4 + 35. Kg1 and perpetual check. But I decided to tempt it because, with the a7, c7 and d5 pawns unprotected and one pawn late, black's chances in an endgame were bad.} 31. Qxa7 {Abandoning the a6 f1 diagonal.} Nf5 {If white doesn't come back by Qa6 to take control of f1, black has a mate in 4. I hoped that white wouldn't see it and would think that the aim of this move was to trade the DSB} 32. Qxc7 {Blunder - mate in 4} Nxg3 {White has only 2 moves available : if 33. fxg3 Rf1 mate...} 33. Rxg3 {So that white takes with the rook.} Rxg3+ {White resigns here. If 34.fxg3 Rf1 mate.}
