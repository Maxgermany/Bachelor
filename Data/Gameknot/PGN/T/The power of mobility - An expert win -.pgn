[Opening "KP (B00), Nimzovich defence, Marshall gambit"]

1. e4 {I start the game with e4, which partially occupies the center and allows a few of my pieces to come out..} Nc6 {My opponent replies with the Nimzovich Defence, which is seldom seen compared to the king's pawn game, the sicilian or the french defence.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {Main line so far.} Rb8 {!? Black throws the opening book out of the window with this move. He either prepares a future b7-b5 push or places his rook on a open file in case I would play Bb5 followed by Bxc6 later I guess. It is not a bad move by any means. More commonly played is 3...Bf5.} 4. Nf3 h5 {Black tries to expand to the kingside, I guess.} 5. Bg5 {However, Black's last move he can't play pawn to h6 anymore, so I place my bishop there to pressurize the kingside.} f6 {Black tries to chase my bishop away...} 6. Qd3 {!? But I have other ideas! My queen aims for the g6 square, where it will deliver a nasty check to the black king.} fxg5 {!? Black accepts the sacrifice and allows the dreaded 7.Qg6+. The position is about equal according to the computer.} 7. Qg6+ Kd7 8. e6+ {! I force the king toward the middle.} Kd6 9. Nxg5 {Here, I threaten a nice royal fork/checkmate with 10.Nf7#. Black is forced to play 9...Nh6.} Nh6 10. c3 {!! The position is very critical. Take a look at the position. Which black pieces can move? Which one can't? The kingside has been completely shut down; The h6 knight can't move or else I play 11.Nf7#, the f8 bishop is stuck behind two black which are themselves blocked by my pieces, The h8 rook CAN move! To g8 and h8 back and forth, accomplishing absolutely nothing. What about the queenside? The black queen can't move without being captured next turn, the c8 bishop can't go anywhere (10...Bxe6?? 11.Qxe6#), the b8 rook isn't doing much (but is better than his kingside counterpart) and the king is stuck on d6. The only available moves that help are moving the a pawn, the b pawn, or the knight. I didn't want the knight to capture on d4, thus it is why I played 10.c3. The main question here is: Can Black get out of trouble safely? What do you think, reader?} b5 {Black reasonably tries to open the queenside to open up some space for his pieces. Gameknot's analysis engine thinks the position is equal.} 11. f4 {? The main idea behind this move was to get to f5 to further support my e6 pawn, but it doesn't quite work. Better here according to the engine was 11.Nd2 leading to 11...Na5 12. Ndf3 Kc6 13. Ne5+ Kb6 14. Ngf7 Nxf7 15. Nxf7 Qe8 16. Nxh8 Qxg6 17. Nxg6 Bxe6 18. Nxf8 Rxf8, with a two point advantage for white...} Na5 12. b4 Nc4 13. Bxc4 {I can't allow that knight to live. I need the control of e5 later, as it is a very strong knight outpost.} bxc4 {I am two points down in material and my opponent threatens to unlock his position. What to do?} 14. Qxh6 {! What else? I think it is the only way to stay in the game.} Rxh6 15. Nf7+ Kxe6 16. Nxd8+ {I recover my queen with check. Material is equal. Even though my knight looks trapped behind the enemy lines, it can't be captured, no matter what Black plays for now.} Kd7 17. Nf7 Rf6 {A nice fork, but I can move my knight with check.} 18. Ne5+ Kd6 19. O-O {Now that most of the available tactics are gone, it is time to play positionally. What are the current standings? Material is equal, I have two knight against Black's bishops, there are many holes in Black's camp and both players has to get their remaining pieces out. I think I have a slight advantage here.} g6 20. Nd2 Bh6 21. g3 Bh3 22. Rf2 {Both players develops their remaining pieces.} Bd7 23. Ndf3 Ba4 24. Raf1 Rbf8 {Both players piles up on the f file.} 25. Nh4 {I attack the g6 pawn...} Be8 {Black defends...} 26. Nhf3 e6 {Black defends his d5 pawn...} 27. h4 {! I lock down the kingside with this move. Since I have two knights against two bishops, I should keep the position closed. Black cannot advance on the kingside without losing material. However, my knights can jump into Black's territory via e5 or g5.} Ke7 {Most of Black's forces are locked to the kingside. What to do...} 28. a4 {! Since my pieces have greater mobility, I can afford to open up the queenside so my rooks invade Black's back rank.} a6 29. Ra1 Kd8 30. Rb2 Ke7 {? Black had to play 30...c6 to slow down my advance on the queenside. Now my rooks can infiltrate the enemy.} 31. b5 a5 32. b6 {Black has to take or else I promote it.} cxb6 33. Rxb6 {Infiltration successful.} Rh8 {Black has no coherent plan right now.} 34. Ra6 {! I attack the lone pawn that can't be protected. However, I have other plans...} Rg8 35. Rb1 {My a pawn obviously cannot be taken} Kf8 36. Rb7 {The other point of 34.Ra6 is that it allows me to double the rooks on the same rank if I need to.} Rg7 {Black challenges my rook... } 37. Rb8 {! I move away, pinning his bishop on the way.} Ke7 {A last ditch effort from Black to get some freedom...} 38. Ra7+ {But his request has been denied. The king is forced to go to f8. (38...Kd6?? 39.Rb6+ Bc6 40.Rxc6#)} Kf8 39. Raa8 Re7 {The only defence. Can you find the winning move without going to the next page? (There are multiple solutions)} 40. Nd7+ {If you answered 40.Nd7+ or noticed the fact that Black is currently in a zugswang, then congratulations. A very interesting variation happens if White plays a waiting move such as 40.Kg2! Black cannot avoid to lose a piece. Sample lines: 40.Kg2! Bg7 (40...g5 41.hxg5 fork)(40...Re7anywhere 41.Rxe8+)(40...Rf5 41.Nxg6+ fork)(40...Kg7 41.Rxe8 Rxe8 42.Rxe8) 41.Ng5 and there are too many threats to deal with. The move I played, 40.Nd7+, also wins. Black can't take the knight: 40...Rxd7 41.Rxe8+ Kg7 (41...Kf7 42.Ne5+ Kg7 43.Rg8+ Kh7 44.Rh8+ Kg7 45.Rag8#) 42.Rg8+ Kf7 (42...Kh7 43.Rh8+ Kg7 44.Rag8+ Kf7 45.Ne5+ Ke7 46.Rh7+! with mate to follow) 43.Ne5+ Ke7 44.Rge8+ Kd6 45.Ra6+ with mate to follow. Anyway, 40.Nd7+ at least forks the king and a rook.} Kg7 41. Rbxe8 {Black still cannot take my knight. I could have played 41.Nxf6 first instead but I thought my knight has more value than his rook.} Rxe8 {Black avoids the trap once again, but he is still lost.} 42. Rxe8 Rf7 43. Nfe5 Rxd7 {43...Rf5 44.Rxe6 isn't much better.} 44. Nxd7 {The rest is just technique.} Kf7 45. Ra8 Ke7 46. Ne5 Bg7 47. Ra7+ Kf8 48. Nxg6+ Kg8 49. Rxa5 {I finally snatch the a pawn.} Bh6 50. Ne5 Bf8 51. Ra8 Kg7 52. Rxf8 {I trade Black last remaining piece to simplify the endgame.} Kxf8 53. a5 Ke7 54. a6 {Black resigns, as he can't stop the promotion. Feel free to comment and rate!}
