1. d4 {I begin my annotation for the endgame on move 31.  Please go forward to move #30 to reach the starting position, and then move forward.  Al } d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 5.

Both kings are shut off from the Queenside. 3.  The white king cannot penetrate the kingside. 4.  d5 will require protection by Black. 5.  The bishop cannot protect d4, the king will be required.  Black's plan: 1.  Restrain the bishop. 2.  Penetrate the position with the knight, using the king to protect e5. 3.  Attack on the kingside, holding the White king near d3/e3 by threat to d4, so that he cannot restrain the penetration of the black king. } 31. Bf5 {Centralizing the bishop, a good idea.} h5 {Beginning the assault.  The bishop is prevented from attacking h5 and d5 by the f7 pawn.  If attacked later, the h5 pawn is mobile.} 32. Bd7 Ke7 {Freeing the knight from the defense of d5.} 33. Bc8 Ng2+ 34. Kd2 {Missing the point.  The King apparently moves to avoid a perceived draw by repetition.} Nh4 {The knight threatens both Nxf3 and f5, which would restrain the bishop. } 35. Ke2 Kf6 {The King moves to penetrate.} 36. Bd7 Nf5 {Offering the exchange, attacking d4, and preparing for the King's incursion.  } 37. Kd3 {The bishop is all white has.  He cannot exchange allowing the Black king in a position to seize f4.  Once the black king gets to f4, the kingside will fall.} Nd6 38. Kd2 {Attacking b5 and keeping the bishop from e8 and f5.  The bishop is now reduced to protection of b5.} h4 {White nears zugzwang.  Black must find a way to advance his king.} 39. Ke3 {Holding d4 and keeping the Black king from f4, the key square in the position.} Ke7 {Beginning the isolation of the bishop, to enable the kings' advance.} 40. Bc6 Nf5+ {With this check, Black begins to reposition the knight.  The knight is an offensive weapon, the bishop has been reduced, almost, to a defensive piece.  A bishop is an attacking piece and does not have the defensive powers of the knight.} 41. Kd3 {Holding d4.} Ke6 {With d7 controlled, the king advances.} 42. Kc3 {The only square from which white can continue to hold d4.} Ne7 {Black Frees f5 for the king!} 43. Be8 {There is nothing else for white, but now the king will penetrate the White kingside.} Kf5 {Black now reaches his target - f4!  It costs only the f-pawn, and wins the game. } 44. Bxf7 {This loses quickly.  White could have held out with Kd3, heading for e2 to protect the f3 pawn. } Kf4 {And, the plan has been carried out.  The White kingside pawns must fall.  Black's d5 is protected by the knight and his other pawns are on black squares, safe from the bishop.  The Black king becomes the raider.} 45. Bh5 {Thinking to hold with Bg4. } Ng8 {The knight is headed for f6, keeping the bishop off of both g4 and h5, allowing the king to pick up the pawn.} 46. Kd2 {Too late.  } Nf6 {Not only is the bishop kept from the protection of f3, but the knight is also protecting d5, so the bishop has no attacking move and no defensive move.} 47. Bg6 Kxf3 {The end.}
