[Opening "Sicilian (B52), Canal-Sokolsky attack, Bronstein gambit"]

1. e4 {Popular as always. I've always been fond of e4 games, regardless if I'm White or Black.} c5 {So I throw out my Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 {This is the Open Variation. (Closed is 2. Nc3). The irony is, while this is the Open lines, the position gets fairly locked up after about another 15 sets of moves...} d6 {I prefer the Dragon/Najdorf lines over the Orthodox line (2 ...Nc6).} 3. Bb5+ {And here, White throws out Bb5+! This line is known as the Canal-Sokolsky (Moscow) Attack. [Coincidentally, I found out that my opponent was Russian, to my humour] This is a line I've wanted to explore myself as White, and to deal with it as Black was actually pretty darn exciting on my end. When dealing with players who use the Najdorf, I like my English Attack, but I've been meaning to try this against players who either fend off that attack well, or avoid it with a different Sicilian line entirely.} Bd7 {Anyway, I block with the bishop. No sense blocking it in with the knight already.} 4. Bxd7+ {And he captures, as expected.} Nxd7 {This is what Black normally plays in the main line, but frankly, given the way this game turned out, in hindsight, perhaps it'd have been better to capture with the Queen- you'll see why soon.} 5. b3 {This is not common. Normally when White plays Bb5+ after Nf3, the goal is to castle as soon as possible in order to capitalize on early development. This is a tactic commonly played in the Ruy Lopez. Instead, my opponent starts a fianchetto on the dark bishop. This isn't necessarily a bad move, and has performed well on the databases, but I certainly wouldn't try this line myself.} Ngf6 {I had to explore the variants of the databases myself, but in the end I decided this was the better move. This deters d4, and if Nc3, then it will surely hinder the eventual Bb2.} 6. d3 {Likewise, White plays this. I can't counterthreat with Bb4+ at all, either.} g6 {I want my bishop out, but Bg5 is playable after e6, so I counter with a fianchetto of my own.} 7. Bb2 {As expected.} Bg7 {And I continue my development.} 8. O-O {White opts to hide the kings away.} O-O {I oblige; I want to see what he wants to do next.} 9. Nbd2 {An OK move, I think. Not sure if I'd have done this. White wants to bring the knight out, but if Nc3, then you block the c-pawn and hinder the dark bishop. He is clearly planning c4 at some point.} e5 {I wasn't too sure what to do here, honestly. White had a lot of good pawn moves- c3/c4, d4, and e5. This at least prevents e5 and d4, and gives me more control over the long dark diagonal.} 10. h3 {This probably wasn't the best of moves. Concerned about an attack on g4, but that clearly isn't going to help me after both light bishops got traded.} Nb8 {And here is the gist of why I'm wondering if 4 ...Qxd7 would have been better for Black. I'm realizing now that my knight pair doesn't have a lot of good squares worth controlling, where they were. Plus, should White open the center now, d6 was totally defenseless if the knight kept blocking the queen's access to it. One look at the board will clearly tell you that there is going to be a lot of queenside action soon, so c6 would have been a better square for this knight all along.} 11. c4 {White finally plays this. My thoughts confirmed- I need to focus my attention to this side of the board now, as he's clearly trying to seize control away from the kings at the moment.} Nc6 {Again, we're seeing the sheer power of this knight instead of where it was on d7... d4 will remain in my control for a long time, and should White try to form an attack on the c5 pawn via b4, I will have defenses ready for that moment.} 12. a3 {White is clearly planning to form an attack on b4, not worried about me forming my own attack on b5 (defensible by playing a4 instead).} a6 {Maybe not the best move. I was planning to secure b5, hoping White declines so that I can play ...b4, myself. However, that didn't quite go as I'd hoped...} 13. Bc3 {White now has two defenders on b4.} a5 {Now I realized that I've wasted another move- playing b5 right now would just allow an immediate b4 from White. I need to strengthen my grip on the square if I want to get my pawn there.} 14. Qc2 {This was another adjusting move that I'm iffy about. You'll see what he's planning, but I think this just gives me more time to re-adjust my part of the board myself.} Ne8 {Which I immediately take advantage of. I was really mourning the poor placement of my knights at this point... I wasted far too much time trying to move everything where I wanted it.} 15. Rab1 {White now has three defenders on b4.} Qb6 {And here was where I started cursing out about 12 ...a6. If I had just played a5 back then, my second knight would already have been helping defend b4 on my part.} 16. Rb2 {White is readjusting his defenses yet again...!} Nc7 {...and it's only just barely enough time for me to get this last knight there...!} 17. Rfb1 {Four defenders on b4! White's going all out on this one.} Na6 {And after all my poor placements of pieces, I get my final, fourth defender on b4. Now, let's re-evaluate the position. Black's pieces are well defended, can move easily, and I have enough space for maneuverability. White, on the other hand, has exhausted all resources available to aid an attack on just one square, and will have a hard time moving out of that congestion if the attack fails to work. GK seems less sure of my argument about this, stating that the position is mostly equal, very slightly in favour of White.} 18. Nf1 {White realizes that I have too many defenders on b4, and that if no other piece can enter that mass, he cannot continue with the attack. He begins to plot a way for the knights to come in- which, honestly, at first glance, looked almost impossible to me.} Rab8 {This was my clear first mistake of the match. "White cannot continue with the b4 attack with both my knights guarding that square with my pawns", I thought. I figured the knights would not be able to somehow gain access to here, that my queen no longer needed to stay on b6 (in danger against White's Rooks), and that I could resume my plan to steal the square from him in the first place.} 19. Ne3 {The tragic part to all this is, if I were to have an alternative move, it would have been Bh6, planning to do Bxe3. I figured that if White had a knight here, he'd be trying to move it to c2- I was waiting for him to move his own queen out of the way. I saw every square that a knight could help on b4, except ONE of them.} Qd8 {Still not seeing it, I moved my queen here, hoping to free her and play b5 as soon as possible.} 20. Nd5 {And... here is the fruit bared from my serious oversight. Every square- except for that one. Somehow, in all the chaos, White found entry, and for once, to his fortune, I lacked too much tempo and too many defenders to do anything about it. b4 is now a possible attack...} b5 {After about a half day of thinking, I decided that I couldn't keep trying to fight b4 in a closed center, and I was hoping desperately that he wouldn't try to intercept this pawn's path to that square...} 21. cxb5 {But, c'est la vie. White's congested queenside is finally going to unravel the way he's been hoping for these past 20 moves. I'm in serious trouble here, as now White can launch an attack that I can't counter by just defending anymore. If I can't advance some other ground, and fast, I will lose everything, here and now.} Rxb5 {Forced, because both knights were forked by the pawn.} 22. b4 {Now White finally launches his ultimate attacking plan. I spent another day carefully evaluating this position. Black is still in terrible shape, and I need to work a way to use the chaos to my advantage.} f5 {Finally, I decide to fight chaos with even more chaos. White has too many defenders on b4, I thought. If I invite exchanges the way things look right now, then I just give him a clear edge by exploiting that side of the board for the entire game. With this move, I confuse matters further, forcing White to make careful choices about how to clearly form an attack while several pieces on the board are being threatened at once. But GK hates this move, stating that I have more of a chance being able to gain ground after triggering the exchanges. I didn't trust that way of thinking at the time. I felt that if I didn't threaten anything at all, I would be forced to defend for the rest of the match, until I eventually cave. } 23. bxa5 {The reason why GK disagreed is because it states that Qb3 would win a rook after a discovered check (23. Qb3! cxd4!? Nc7+! Kh8, Nxb5). What I'm left wondering, is why the heck does the computer think I'd not just play Kh8 first? If White tried playing bxa5 after this, I would have Rxb3!!} Rxb2 {At any rate, my opponent probably was surprised about f5, and the declining of the exchanges, so I was fine with him sparking them for me. I was too busy trying to figure out my own plans of attack at this point.} 24. Rxb2 {This was as far as the exchanges had to go from the b4 ordeal. Now I get another chance to start something... even more chaotic.} Nd4 {GK has a habit of not liking my chaos moves. It knocks me down another half point here for some unjustified reason, but after this new set of exchanges, it will open the board up a lot more. You're free to agree or disagree with me, but I think in the end, it gave me a much better overall shot at the game from this point on. I didn't want the board to be enclosed by pawns for the next part of my plan.} 25. Nxd4 {Likewise, White is uncomfortable with all the chaos, and agrees to open the board.} exd4 {I'm eager, so I dive for it.} 26. Bd2 {Forced, because any other square either blocks the bishop, or leads to capture.} fxe4 {And now, this capture gives me a beautiful looking reach on the f2 square! I know that White is going to start a plan to enter my back rank by rushing down the b-file sooner or later, so while he's going to occupy his focus on the queenside, I need to start any possible means of aggression on his kingside.} 27. Rb6 {And lo and behold, I was right on my thinking that he was going to act on this way soon.} Qh4 {So I start my portion of the attack, exploiting the fact that the bishop was forced onto e2.  } 28. g3 {White now realizes that I have a mating attack on the f-pawn, and starts to defend.} exd3 {So now I spark a Queen gambit. If White accepts, and trades queens, I was certain that my bypassed center pawns would allow me to regain my queen faster than he could recover his on a8.} 29. Qxd3 {White realizes this as well, and declines. Now I can retreat without losing the pawn.} Qh5 {I play this nasty move. I threaten both Qd1+, or Qxd5. } 30. Rxa6 {And here we reach the point where I'm not sure if getting the Computer Analysis for this game helped me too much. The weird thing about everything in this game is, since 27. Qh4, the Computer was saying that I was making several mistakes- not because my moves were bad ideas, but rather my timing for these good moves was off. It says that I needed to swap my pawn off first, allowing the knight to drop on a6 sooner, and then start threatening mate by moving the Queen to h4. It was the same strategy I just deployed, but I timed it differently. Now GK says I'm up +1.50 at this point, and I can't say that out of all the chaos I sparked after playing f5, that it's helped me much since I played in more of an unorthodox fashion this game.} Qxd5 {All I knew was that at this point, Black had made a full recovery, returning in full force back into the game. My pawns still occupying the center are definitely stronger than his pawns trying to reach promotion, but his king was better protected than mine. I wasn't too sure if I had a secure winning edge, but I was definitely far more hopeful about winning than after allowing b4, 10 moves ago.} 31. Ra7 {White probably wasn't sure if he has a winning edge either, but surely he was very concerned by my control of the center at this point. I imagine he figured that if he were to make an attack that would win him the game, he needed to activate it now, or else he'd need to purely launch defensive actions.} c4 {And so it begins... I start walking my tightrope, trying to plan my attack on f2, before he can plan one on my 7th rank. I start my efforts here, exploiting the awkward placement of his bishop and queen.} 32. Qe2 {The White Queen cannot stay on the 3rd rank, so it retreats here, planning Qe7.} Be5 {So I block her path to the 7th rank. Once again, GK frustrates me- stating that I shouldn't have needed to worry about the queen-rook pair screaming mating threats on g7 and h7. But, you know, I only had every instinct in me as a chess player telling me that letting him do that was a bad idea!!!!! (For the record, GK prefers c3, but I sure as hell didn't.)} 33. Qg4 {He plays this. I see that he's targeting d7 now, and this time, I don't think I can stop him.} Qf3 {So I play this, clamping down on the f-pawn, and threatening mate if the Queen dares to go away. I was really sure that if White declines the queen exchange, and moved her out, that I could at least draw the game, if not secure that if either side was going to be able to mate- that it'd be Black.} 34. Qe6+ {And as I figured, White plays this, making one final push on a mate threat.} Kh8 {If I had allowed Qe7 from White, I'd have been able to play Qf7 to block, and exchange the rooks and Queens that way. But since I decided not to do that, I'm forced to move my king in the corner. Rf7 and Qf7 both lose here.} 35. Be1 {White did not have many options at this point. I thought this was a draw move, but apparently, it wasn't this at all- but rather, Bf4. Now GK says this is a fatal blunder- I'm more than +10.00 now.} Qe2 {And this is the reason why. The bishop is going to fall now, and I'm ready to blast White open.} 36. Rf7 {A desperate attempt to cut the rook off from the attack. If I screw this up, there will be no chance at a draw anymore. The next mistake ultimately loses the match one way or the other.} Qxe1+ {Fortunately for me, I have the first move, and his King must flee.} 37. Kh2 {But I was shocked to see this! This move obviously loses! Why didn't White play Kg2 instead?!} Bxg3+ {The bishop can now be sacrificed to the King, and the White Queen is left hanging like the sassy miserable thing she is. White resigns here. But I'm left wondering why White had to play Kh2- was Kg2 mating? Because I sure didn't see how! At any rate, this match was definitely more exciting than I've been playing lately, and I was happy to earn the win after this long, drawn out battle! Thanks for reading the annotation! :)}
