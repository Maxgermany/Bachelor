1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. Nf3 d6 4. e3 Bf5 5. d4 exd4 {Standard play so far.} 6. exd4 {I could have recaptured with the Knight, but I thought having powerful, united central Pawns was more important than centralizing my horseman.} Bb6 {Black could have been aggressive with the pinning move 6... B-QN5, but instead chooses to retreat. I could have responded with 7 P-QR3 forcing the exchange of minor pieces if Black doesn't want his Bishop trapped.} 7. Bd3 {I offer an exchange of B's and clear the way for castling.} Bg6 {Black chooses to retreat to a square where I can still exchange B's. Apparently he wants me to initiate it...} 8. Bxg6 {...which I do...} hxg6 {...and he completes it.} 9. O-O {Now, on to castling. } Nf6 {Black clears the way for castling. However, he never completes the job by actually moving his King into safety...} 10. b4 {I aim to seize Q-side space. There's also the possiblity of trapping the B...} a6 {...which Black negates by creating a cubbyhole.} 11. Re1+ {Having failed to castle when he had the chance, Black now has to forfeit the privilege.} Kf8 {Now my Rook controls the open file.} 12. Bg5 {With Black unable to play ...P-KR3, I take advantage with an aggressive pin.} Rh5 {This move is pointless, as the Bishop is guarded. Black certainly isn't going to trade his Rook for it...} 13. c5 {I merely aim to force Black's B backwards.} dxc5 {This move contains a hidden danger.} 14. dxc5 {Black's best line is 14... QxQ 15 QRxQ B-R2. His position would be very cramped but he'd at least maintain immediate survival. Instead...} Ba7 {..he commits a disastrous blunder. Black has forgotten that his QN is blocking the Rook from guarding his first rank...} 15. Qxd8+ {...and this move wraps it up.}
