[Opening "French (C18), Winawer, classical variation"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {The winawer variation. Bobby fischer thought it to unsound ,but  in the majority of his games he lost. Black parts with his dark squared bishop to disrupt whites pawn position.The risk is that blacks dark squares may become very weak. If black can wear out the storm he may be better in a endgame.} 4. e5 {main line.} c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Qc7 {Not the mainline usual here is 6...Ne7 ,but i wanted to play this old move of Botvinnik ,which is just as good as Ne7} 7. Qg4 f5 {the main idea black defends the g7 square.} 8. Qg3 Nc6 {Developing and the same time attacking d4.} 9. Ne2 {The first mistake by white.The knight is headed for f4 ,but blocks the bishop.} cxd4 10. cxd4 Nge7 11. c3 {white doesnt grab the pawn because 11.Qxg7 Rg8 12.Qxh7 Nxd4 13.Nxd4 Qc3 check dropping the rook.} O-O 12. h4 {I dont understand this move.Blacks position is very solid.} Bd7 13. Bg5 Rf7 14. Nf4 Nxd4 {White is not developed but this only leads to a draw with correct play.} 15. cxd4 Qa5+ 16. Ke2 Bb5+ 17. Nd3 {Now white is losing .He avoids perpetual check thinking he has a won position but.} f4 18. Qg4 {not the best defense but 18.Nxf4 Nf5 attack the queen and threatens Nxd4 but 18.Qh3 f3!! wins.} Bxd3+ 19. Kxd3 Qb5+ {its over } 20. Kc2 Rc8+ 21. Kd1 Qb3+ {game over black resigns it all over.}
