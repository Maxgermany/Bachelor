1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's Defense} 3. Nc3 Be6 4. d3 Be7 5. Be3 Nc6 6. Be2 Nf6 7. h3 Qd7 8. Qd2 O-O-O 9. a3 a6 10. O-O h5 11. d4 h4 {While black is assaulting white's castle, this move was a mistake.  Pd5 pawn forks black's knight and bishop, with a pawn, knight, and queen backing it.  Lots of power on this critical central square.} 12. Nh2 Rdg8 13. dxe5 {13. d5 and white trades a pawn for a knight or bishop.} dxe5 14. Rfe1 g5 {15 Bxg5, it is a free pawn.  The drawback is black's rooks lined up on white's castle wall.} 15. Bxg5 Ne8 {While white's black bishop is exposed, moving it needlessly sacrifices the queen.  White should trade queens to save the bishop.} 16. Bxe7 {Blunder.  Black should play QxQd2.} Nxe7 {Qe3, or Qd3.  Qe3 seems stronger.} 17. Qxd7+ {Or that.} Bxd7 18. Ng4 Ng6 19. Bc4 Bxg4 {Bxf7 looks promising.} 20. hxg4 Nd6 21. Nd5 {Nope.  e7 is covered.  Be2 protects the undefended Pg4.  Bd5 does not work, because c6 traps the bishop.  But Nd5 tosses the bishop on the trash heap.  21. b3 would have worked, but promoted black's b5 response.  Free pawn advancement.} Nxc4 22. b3 Nd6 23. c4 c6 24. Nb6+ Kd8 25. Na4 {I like c5 better.  Make black move his knight, then Nc4 is available.} Nf4 26. f3 h3 27. gxh3 Nxh3+ 28. Kf1 Nf4 29. Red1 Kc7 30. Kf2 Nh3+ 31. Kg3 Ng5 32. Nc5 Rh3+ 33. Kg2 Rxf3 34. a4 Rh3 35. Nd3 Ndxe4 36. Nxe5 Rg3+ 37. Kf1 f6 38. Nd3 Rxg4 39. Rde1 Nd2+ 40. Ke2 Nxb3 41. Ra2 {The rook is lined up with the king, making it vulnerable.  White can interpose the knight, but with two pieces black could take it.} Nd4+ 42. Kd1 Ndf3 43. Rf1 Rxc4 {Molestation of the pawns proceeds apace.} 44. Ke2 Re8+ 45. Kf2 Rh8 {Black can play Rh2+ and take Ra2.  Rh4 gives black the remaining pawn, but the rook is more valuable.} 46. a5 {Blunder.} Rh2+ 47. Ke3 {Kg4 would have been better.} Re4# {}
