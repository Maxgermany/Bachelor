1. e4 {my usual please landlord....E4 it's what i know and love.} c6 {I don't like this move for him i mean it stops Nc6 i like Nc6...} 2. Nc3 {Developing....} d5 {Ditto...} 3. d3 dxe4 {you know whats coming....A typical trade off..} 4. Nxe4 Bf5 {Hmmm, is he gonna exchange off pieces this early? i sometimes get uncomfortable with trading off this early i wonder if the opponent just likes to take rather than think..generally speaking.} 5. Qf3 {take me or i take you, or run.....plus i develop a little more. I don't know if this was my best option i could just leave the knight and carry on as normal maybe Be2 or something} e6 {Or get back up, of course theres no way back for that bishop now, he's committed to the cause..} 6. Ng3 {I quite fancy that bishop now pawn aswel! thats if i get a chance..} Bg6 {Very coy.....how cute...} 7. Be3 {back to development then....} Bd6 8. Nh3 {can't remember why i did this but it looks good, right? I think i saw this in a book and decided to give it a go....} Nd7 9. Ng5 {Just a push really...maybe i was better off with Ne4 with ideas of Nd6 ..} Ngf6 {clearing the way....Still don't know why i havn't gone to Ne4...} 10. h3 {Just in case, it's like a nervous tic i have on the chess board.....} Ne5 {Alert!! Queen threatened....And some major advancement on his part, i'm getting claustrophobic in here..} 11. Qd1 {Back to safety....for a little while..} Qc7 {Hmmm...} 12. c3 {An exit route.....} Ned7 13. Ng3e4 {Trying to exchange off a few bits just to clear the congestion..Too late me thinks..} O-O-O {yup...} 14. Nxd6+ {I like bishops, yum yum...plus i felt i needed to relieve some of the pressure i was feeling..} Qxd6 {he had to....forced pretty much...} 15. Be2 {had to protect that little beauty...And i had to clear the way for a quick castle should the need arise..} h6 {if only that bishop wasn't there Bg6..I'de love to go Nf7 right now..} 16. Nf3 {So back i go.....i hate going back if it's out of sheer self preservation but i had to really..} b6 17. Qa4 {That back door again? Probably not. i'm hoping for a miracle i'm rubbing that lamp real hard but no genie is appearing..} Kb7 {hmmmm...} 18. O-O {Time to castle.....} Nc5 {This is a double edged threat look at the eye's on d3, that's gotta be his entry point...} 19. Qc2 {So i try to block that entrance..} Nd5 {I'm not liking this knight advance, we're all level material wise so i'm happy to exchange off a few pieces but i'de rather not right now because positionally i think he would be better off, lets see what happens...} 20. Bd4 {A rook for your trouble sir? again more wishful thinking...} f6 {I thought not...} 21. b4 {How about a knight then?} Nd7 {No.....I feel at this point had i made the right move i may have caused a bit of trouble here...} 22. g3 {To stop Nf4 and the threat to my bishop...and to stop him eyeing d3 aswel...} e5 {Erk!...too late to cause an irritation on the queen side now..} 23. Be3 {Back and forth...} Rhf8 {He's starting to coordinate his forces i need a reply with menace...and plenty of it..} 24. a3 {Does that scare you?..} f5 {He's getting closer...} 25. Bd2 {So i move further away this looks weak but i have my reasons...} Bh5 {Go away!!} 26. c4 {I'm starting to like this pawn thing i got goin on here....} Nd5f6 {Bye bye...It's about time he did a bit of the retreating..} 27. b5 {I had so many options here but i chose to keep the pawn advance going simply to keep pressure on his king....on reflection this was the wrong move maybe Qa4 would have been better...} cxb5 {Good i like a king who's pawn guard is shattered...But not completely ruined sadly...} 28. Bb4 {Come to me queenie...} Nc5 {Ah....I got blocked there well and truely....} 29. cxb5 {I'll have to make do with a pawn...} Qd5 30. Nh2 {I didn't want to lose 2 pieces for the price of 1...} e4 {Things are getting sticky here he's all over me with more potential movement and better lines, i could be in trouble... } 31. d4 {i just couldn't allow e4xd3 threatening both queen and bishop so a pawn sacrifice is the order of the day...} Nb3 {This is a nightmare i gotta keep dodging bullets and i aint bullet proof!} 32. Rab1 {all i could do..} Nxd4 {see what i mean about running and bullets?} 33. Qa4 {threatening check..} Bxe2 {this was innevitable what to do now, by this time i got tag in my ear boasting and pontificating...} 34. Rfc1 {This cause for major action....} Bxb5 {i'm really getting it from tag now, i hope my plan works....} 35. Rc7+ {Suprise!! A rook sacrifice, something needed to be done i hope this works...} Kxc7 {A little respite but i can see this turning into a bloodbath...} 36. Qxa7+ Qb7 {He's got all bases covered and i have no answers...} 37. Rc1+ {Just to keep myself alive....} Nc6 38. Qxb7+ {No choice....} Kxb7 39. Ra1 {I'm just waiting to be put out of my misery now, i've resorted to pawn pushing... pawn pushing.....} Nxb4 {He's doing what i would do, trade off material, he has it to burn, i don't!!} 40. axb4 Rd4 {Not my pawn!} 41. Rb1 Rfd8 {Oh poo!} 42. f3 {Here we go more pawn pushing, just deal with me tag and do it now!} Rd4d1+ {My swan song coming up..} 43. Rxd1 {again forced play, but the last thing i want to do...} Rxd1+ {HELP!!} 44. Kg2 {I'm in a corner and wondering where it went wrong....} Rd2+ {King hunt on!} 45. Kg1 {up and down...} Nh5 {here comes sir kill me off..} 46. Nf1 {what the hell, i've lost the will to live now, i want it over and quick...} Bxf1 {great...} 47. Kxf1 Nxg3+ 48. Ke1 Ra2 49. fxe4 {Pawn pushing again, it's all i have left...} Kc6 50. b5+ Kc5 51. e5 Kd5 52. e6 Kxe6 53. Kd1 {I say i'm happy to resign now, please spare me....} Kd5 {This is getting emmbarresing i really should resign but i want to give tag the pleasure of saying checkmate so i plod on..} 54. Kc1 Kc4 55. Kb1 Kb3 56. h4 f4 57. Kc1 f3 58. Kd1 f2 59. Kc1 f1=Q# {And there we have it, still havn't worked out what went wrong, i'll work it out though. Cheers, good game.}
