1. f4 d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ {Here we go again!} Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 {This is virtually the "book move" here now.  No one seems to like ...Ke8 or ...Kd6.} 9. Bxg4 Nd7 {Around here, yoshark announced that he had an interesting new plan that took advantage of 2...g6.  I can't say that I saw how, in the succeeding moves.} 10. Nc3 {I carried on with natural developing moves.} e5 {This seems a good move, lessening the potential impact of White's threatened Ne6 and attempting to undermine the N on g5.} 11. Ncxe4 {This might seem greedy, but its main motivation was supporting the N on g5 and the second benefit is enabling development of d-pawn and dsb.  Meanwhile the N on g5 still has plenty of options.} Qe7 12. d3 exf4 {?! surprisingly helping White to mobilise his dsb.  This seems an unnecessary waste of tempo compared with 12...Bg7 or 12....Rd8} 13. Bxf4 h6 {This seems sensible, chasing the N away, and probably following up with other pawn pushes that also disturb White's army of minor pieces.} 14. Ne6 {Finally the N moves to its favourite square - but only when pushed.  Now there's a threat to win the c7 pawn or to deliver check from d4 and start a king hunt... but there is a down side...} Qh4+ 15. g3 Qxg4 {The Bishop falls off :-(} 16. Nd4+ Kb6 17. O-O {It was too early to pursue the king yet: more important to develop the KR and get the King behind some pawns.} Nc5 18. Nf6 {Avoiding the swap, White attacks the Black Queen and prepares either Nd5 or Nd7 (i the right circumstances)} Qc8 {The only other square was h3} 19. Nd5+ Ka6 20. Nxc7+ {In view of the succeeding moves, perhaps this was a waste of time.  20. Bxc7 may have been more accurate.  I never took the opportunity to win the exchange seriously since I needed the N more than Black needed his useless Rook.} Kb6 21. Nd5+ Ka6 22. Bc7 {This threatens mate in one with 23. Nb4#} Ne6 {Black forks the Bc7 and the Nd4 while simultaneously revealing his Bishop's defence of b4} 23. Rxf8 {!  a nice exchange sac that reasserts the mate threat.} Qxf8 {Black has to retake with the Q to continue to defend b4, thus sacrificing the Ne6.} 24. Nxe6 {White still has time to reset the mating pattern.} Qc8 25. Nd4 b6 {Creates a hole but...} 26. a4 {White tries to open up a file for his Rook} Rd8 {Black skewers White's Knights.  If White takes the Rook, Black can either retake immediately or pin the N on d4.} 27. Nb4+ {This appears just to drive Black's king to safety} Kb7 28. Bxd8 {White has nothing else more constructive, but the more wood leaves the board the better it gets for Black, who still has a Queen.} Qxd8 29. c3 Rc8 30. Rf1 {White finally activates his remaining Rook, threatening to occupy the 7th rank.} Qg5 {This threatens ...Qe3+ but White gets his threats in first.} 31. Rf7+ Rc7 {? This falls for a devastating fork.} 32. Rxc7+ {and Black resigned because of 32....Kxc7 33. Ne6+, winning the Queen.}
