1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 e6 3. c4 d5 4. d4 dxc4 5. Qc2 Qd5 {!? This is a move not seen that often} 6. Nc3 Bb4 7. Bg2 Qe4 {?? This simply drops a piece.} 8. Qd2 {?? White can immediately win a piece with 8.Qa4+! Nc6 9.Nh4! Qg4 10.Bxc6+.} Bxc3 {?! This just releases all the pressure. Black should have simply retreated his queen instead of playing this move. Now white will have no trouble developing his queenside.} 9. Qxc3 {!} Qd5 10. O-O Nc6 11. Bf4 O-O 12. Bxc7 Qh5 {?! This simply unnecessarily drops another whole pawn although it threatens ...Nd5.} 13. Qxc4 {! Simple and best.} Nd5 14. Bd6 {!?} Rd8 15. Ba3 Nb6 16. Qc3 f6 {?! An unnecessary waste of time.} 17. Rfd1 e5 {This now shows the justification for black's previous move, but black's development is lagging.} 18. d5 {? This sacrifices a pawn to open up the position, but this is however unnecessary. White should have continued with the simple 18.dxe5.} Rxd5 {? The simple 18...Nxd5! would have been much better, as white has no attack after 19.Qc5!? Be6! 20. e4 Nb6! 21.Rxd8+ Rxd8. However, this gives a pawn back by force.} 19. Rxd5 Nxd5 20. Qb3 {! This is the only move winning the pawn back, as after 20.Qc4 black has 20...Be6! 21.e4 Nf4!, when forced is 22.Qc3, as 22.Qa4 loses to 22...Nxg2 23.Kxg2 Bh3+. Here 20...Be6 loses to 21.Qxb7.} Qf7 {?? This is a losing move, due to the tactical shot played on the next move. Black should have given up a pawn with 20...Be6 21.Qxb7 Rc8.} 21. Nxe5 {! The white bishop attacks black's d5- knight while the e5-knight attack's black's queen. Black cannot prevent loss of material.} Nd4 {Honestly, I had not seen this as an option for black! However, I still was able to refute it.} 22. Bxd5 {!} Be6 23. Nxf7 {!} Nxb3 24. Bxb3 Kxf7 25. Ba4 {?! I just wanted to keep the bishop pair when I played this. However, I see nothing wrong with 25.Bxe6+ Kxe6 26.Rc1. Now white will have to use some time to develop his rook withoug losing a pawn.} Rb8 {! This move is the only move to delay the rook's development even further.} 26. b3 {?? I blitzed out this move without thinking about its consequences. I got my punishment!} b5 {! Now the a4-bishop is trapped.} 27. Bxb5 Rxb5 28. Rc1 Ra5 {?! This  makes the rook more or less out of play.} 29. Rc7+ Kg6 30. Bf8 {!? But my opponent found a slick solution} Bf7 {! This is the only move that will temporarily hold. I still remember wondering if I could even win at this point.} 31. a4 a6 32. h4 Rd5 {Finally the rook is back to doing something.} 33. f3 {!?  I was secretly thinking about playing something like Kf2 and e4 to TRY to get the rook off the 5th rank.} Rd8 {? Now I get my piece back! The rook was required on the 5th-rank to prevent h5+.} 34. h5+ {!} Kxh5 {Forced.} 35. Rxf7 Kg6 {Now this was another surprise to me, but to those masters: What do I know?} 36. Rxg7+ Kf5 37. Rf7 {?! } h5 38. Be7 {!? Although this (again) drops a piece, I will not consider it bad as it liquidates into an easily winning pawn endgame that may be even more advantageous than being a piece up.} Rd7 {A pin!} 39. Rxf6+ {Of course.} Ke5 {Only now did I realize I would be forced to give up a piece, as 40.Rf7? loses to 40...Ke6!} 40. Rxa6 Rxe7 41. Ra5+ Kd4 42. Rxh5 Rxe2 {I am now in an easily winning rook-and-pawn endgame.} 43. Rh2 {I didn't know what I was thinking, but this, (of course) doesn't change the result.} Re1+ 44. Kf2 Re3 45. b4 Kd3 {!?} 46. g4 Re2+ 47. Kg3 {All other moves lose.} Re1 48. Rg2 {!? I was thinking of supporting my kingside pawns and giving up my queenside ones. I chose to use the rook instead of the king and instead of letting the pawns support themselves.} Rb1 49. b5 Rb4 {White loses a pawn unless he playes 50.Ra2, but it doesn't matter.} 50. Kh2 Rxa4 51. g5 Ra5 52. b6 {! Making black waste another tempo trying to attack the pawn.} Rb5 53. g6 Rxb6 54. g7 {You may all think I bombed this endgame, but it's just because I was impatient. At least I didn't throw away the win!} Rb8 55. g8=Q Rxg8 56. Rxg8 Ke3 57. Kg2 {This was another blitzed out move. I maybe should have played 57.Kg3 instead.} Kf4 58. Rf8+ {And now the rook is supporting the f-pawn. Black resigned.}
