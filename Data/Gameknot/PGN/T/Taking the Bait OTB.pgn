1. e4 {Another game versus one of my co-workers, Ian.  I begin with my usual e4!} e5 2. Bc4 {I have recently began to like this move more and more.  It feels strong in the center.} Nh6 {I have never been a big fan of the N on the edge of the board.} 3. d4 d6 4. Bxh6 {here is why the N should never be allowed on h6.  Now the king side pawn structure is ruined and there's doubled pawns on the H-file.} gxh6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. d5 {I had to make a tough decision here, I didn't want to block my N and my light bishop, but I didn't like the exchange problem imposed by his B on g7.} c6 {Now he made my choice easy opening up the d5 square like I wanted.} 7. dxc6 Nxc6 {they always say take with the piece worth less.  this move allows me to advance my N, as opposed to if he had taken with the pawn I would've been stuck.} 8. Qf3 {figured I'd try for a quick mate on f7.} Qc7 {spoiled} 9. Nd5 {here's the N move that would've been blocked if he'd taken with the pawn.} Qd7 10. Nf6+ {Here I know that he must take with the bishop, and I'm then his rook and pawn are en prise.  So I will at least win a pawn.} Bxf6 11. Qxf6 Rf8 12. Qxh6 {Worked exactly how predicted.} Nd4 {Once he made this move I noticed an opportunity to trap his queen if he forks my rook.  Can you see it without looking ahead?} 13. a4 {Setting up the trap.} Nxc2+ 14. Kd1 {I go ahead and attack leaving him with less options.} Nxa1 15. Bb5 {trap sprung!  Now the Q is trapped.} a5 16. Bxd7+ Bxd7 17. Qxd6 Rd8 {An evil little plot by my friend, if he bxp then my queen is up the creek...} 18. Qxe5+ Be6+ 19. Ke2 {Here I knew I would have to come up a rank anyways to free my rook, so I go ahead and take the liberty here. } b6 20. b3 {A dubious move, just checking to see if I could check and take his N...ya never know unless you try. :)} Nxb3 21. Qb5+ Rd7 {He did good and kept his bishop on guard.} 22. Nf3 {N move to keep the forking from happening.} f6 23. Qxb6 Rff7 {His first REAL blunder.  Leaving the bishop unprotected. The Queen trap earlier wasn't necessarily a blunder, just a technical oversight. } 24. Qxe6+ Kf8 25. Qxb3 Rdb7 26. Qd5 Rb2+ 27. Nd2 {After the loss of his bishop and knight, he decides there's no need to advance this game any further. }
