1. e4 {This interesting verson of the Scotch game shows the danger of 3.d6 if white plays dxe5} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Scotch opening} d6 {Unusual black third move... exd4 is the main line, after which white can retake the pawn with the knight or leave the pawn and play c3 or Bc4} 4. dxe5 {If black wants to recapture, he won't be able to castle because we will trade queens unless he gives up a pawn} dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {Black played this version because white often does not play 4 dxe5 because of the exchange of queens improving black's chance of equalizing} 6. Bb5 Nd4 {also possible is Ne7 but any other move loses the pawn} 7. Nxd4 exd4 {Black now has one pawn which has advanced far into my territory and all his other pieces on the squares where they started, except his king} 8. Nd2 {i planned to play Nf3 next} Bb4 {Black decides to exchange my knight for his bishop, which leave me with the bishop pair} 9. a3 Bxd2+ 10. Bxd2 {Now i have the bishop pair and a choice of which way to castle.  } Bd7 11. Bc4 {I don't want to trade down to a draw} f6 {Be6 was also possible} 12. O-O-O {i want a discovered attack on the black pawn} Ne7 13. Bb4 Nc6 {black trys to hold the pawn} 14. Bd5 {i want to capture the C pawn and black has no way of stopping me.... } Nxb4 15. axb4 c6 16. Bb3 Kc7 17. Rxd4 {This pawn proves to be the difference in the game} Rae8 18. f3 {having my pawns on the white squares isn't ideal but i don't have a choice at this point} g5 19. Rhd1 Re7 20. g3 Bh3 21. Bc4 b5 22. Bf1 {I wanted to trade the bishops because i didn't want to end up in an endgame with bishop and pawns vs bishop and pawns because it would be more likely black could force a draw } Bxf1 23. Rxf1 Rd8 24. Rfd1 Rxd4 25. Rxd4 Rd7 {Black wants to trade down to an endgame where its all pawns and 7 against his 6 so this is fine with me} 26. c3 {Instead of the obvious Rxd7, i play this move to prevent him from getting essentially a free move for his king.  Also this closes the only chance he has of getting his king to my side without exchanging pawns} Rxd4 27. cxd4 Kd6 28. Kd2 h5 29. Kd3 Ke6 30. b3 a6 31. Ke3 Kd6 32. f4 Ke6 33. h4 g4 34. f5+ {allows me to drive back the black king and position my king in support of e5 before i take on that square with my pawn on e4} Kd6 35. Kf4 {E5 is mine} Ke7 36. e5 Kf7 {black hopes to gain opposition with Kxf6} 37. exf6 Kxf6 38. Ke4 {i have two safe squares without retreating and he has one.... here my opponent resigned because he has no way to stop my pawn from promoting.  }
