[Opening "Sicilian (B22), Alapin's variation (2.c3)"]

1. e4 {Blitz with e4!  I definitely cannot make good positional judgments in a quick game compared to, say, correspondence.} c5 {Darn, a Sicilian, he probably is booked up decently well in his line, and I don't want to have to fumble around with what little knowledge I have, so I avoid all that with...} 2. c3 {The Alapin variation.  I know, I'm definitely a wuss for not adventuring into Open Sicilian lines.} Nc6 {I suspect he doesn't know what he's playing.  2... Nf6 and 2... d5 are better.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. cxd4 {A nice center for white already.} e6 {I suspect 4... d5 is stronger here, playing the position similarly to the Nimzovich Defense} 5. Nf3 Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Nge7 {Probably why he chose to develop with 5... Bb4 , so he could get the Knight to e7 and quickly castle.  It's a fairly decent plan, but he does run into a hitch.} 7. Bd3 {Better here than on b5 or c4, which would threaten nothing.} d5 {Trying to grab a stake in the center.} 8. e5 {Which I just push past; I'm very comfortable with this type of setup.} O-O {??  My opponent is clearly playing too quickly, and I go into a relatively deep think here (about 20-30 seconds) assessing the position for my tactical shot.} 9. Bxh7+ {Gets the ball rolling.  } Kxh7 {Even 9... Kh8 would eventually lose to Ng5, Qh5 (or something similar, with the same theme).} 10. Ng5+ {The natural continuation, of course.} Kg6 {Generally thought of as better than the alternative Kg8.  [10... Kg8  11. Qh5 Re8  12. Qh7  Kf8  13. Qh8  Ng8  14. Nh7  Ke7  15. Bg5  Nf6  16. Qxg7 Kd7  17. Nxf6  Kc7  18. Nxe8 ]  and black is down the exchange and two pawns.} 11. h4 {The key for whenever black runs out to g6.} Bxc3+ {Probably done to give himself just marginally more time to think.} 12. bxc3 {Same situation.} Qa5 {In order to avoid the immediate [13. h5  Kh6  14. Nxf7 ] where white can pick off the queen.  However, mate threats still loom.} 13. h5+ {Sentencing black to some painful discovered checks on h6.} Kh6 14. Qd3 {In order to cut off the h7 retreat when the white knight moves.} Nxd4 {??  Now, black's only try was to give back the piece with Nf5.  Though, heavy material losses would be soon to follow with white's attack still alive.} 15. Nxe6+ {??  15. Nxf7 is mate.} g5 16. hxg6 e.p.# {But this mate is prettier in my opinion.  Knight mates happen all the time, so I find it slightly more aesthetically pleasing when a pawn mates. }
