1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 {Initiates the Trompowsky Attack. While I've gotten rolled up by very strong players who sally this opening against me, the move itself has never impressed me as a particularly strong one; and of course I'd expect a very strong player to roll me up anyway, now matter whether they play this move or not, and no matter what my reply to 2. Bg5 might be.} g6 {And so I reply to White's impudent 2. Bg5 here the way I always do, by thumbing my nose it it. If White wants to swap a perfectly good bishop for a Knight right out of the gate, he's more than welcome to.} 3. Nc3 {Six of one, half a dozen of the other... The alternatives here are numerous. Stereotypical would be 3. c4, but Bf6, Nf3, g3, or e3 are also all quite playable. The attractive point of the text move is that it looks to begin an attack immediately. Of course that's usually a course frought with risk no matter who initiates it; but on the other hand such games are almost always fun to play over and analyze.} Bg7 {A challenging move, as we'll see. The most prudent reply was 3. ...d5. But this is unrated skittles: and who wants to play "prudently" against a C-player when there's exciting chess to be had? Black thumbs his nose at White for the second time in as many moves, saying, "Show me what you've got!"} 4. e4 d6 5. e5 dxe5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+ 7. Rxd1 Nfd7 8. Nd5 {Enterprising! White goes straight for the fork} Bxe5 9. g3 {An interesting move. Black has to make a decision now, to drive off the Knight with ....c6; or to play the Bishop back to d6, to guard the e-pawn and threaten ...e5 if White plays Bf4. The latter continuation is certainly the correct choice, but I guess I wasn't in a mood for making "correct choices." And so ...} f6 10. Bf4 Bxf4 11. gxf4 Kd8 {Admittedly all the preceding looks just odd and unforced. But let's stop and take a look at the position for a second: White has a lead in development, true, but his developed pieces have no coordination, and his Kingside pawn structure is blown to hell only 11 moves into the game. Black, on the other hand, has no weaknesses except the for-now unexploitable hole at e6 and the xray on his King. But after 12. ...c6 followed by ...Kc7 and ...Nb6, the xray disappears and Black is left with Kingside pawns he can quickly mend (and solid pawns after that), and his development will quickly catch up. What's not to like?} 12. Bg2 c6 13. Nc3 Kc7 14. Nf3 Na6 15. O-O Nb6 {Black has nearly completed the full repair of his position. White had better think of something constructive to do quickly, or he's just going to drift into a very difficult endgame.} 16. Rfe1 Re8 17. Nd4 Bf5 {White has chosen the most active plan, and now Black acknowledges it offering to spoil his own pawns to get rid of one of the pesky White Knights. The move 17. ...Nc5 is met with 18. b4.} 18. Nxf5 gxf5 19. Bh3 e5 {The check 19. ...Rg8 does nothing except help White challenge for the g-file after Kh1 ... Rg1, so the plan is to sac a pawn for some play in the center.} 20. fxe5 fxe5 21. Bxf5 Rad8 {Black has been walking a tightrope with his play, and now sacrifices a pawn to keep his pieces active: White's Rooks must be challenged before they unite on a file.} 22. Bxh7 Rxd1 23. Rxd1 Re7 24. Bf5 Nc5 {Although this Knight is heading for the Kingside, to help with both defense and attack there, the immediate purpose of the move was to delay White from playing Ne4.} 25. b4 Ne6 26. a4 {White continues to play actively, for the win. And why not? He's a pawn up and has a Bishop for a Knight. But Black is far from helpless in this position.} Nf4 27. a5 Nc8 {Exchanges just ease Black's defensive chore, especially if White gives up his powerful Bishop. The move 27. ...Nc4 also looks at d6 for the Knight, but the text presents White with an immediate temptation. Meanwhile, 27. ...Nbd5 just exchanges a Knight-pair or is met with 28. Ne4 followed by the mobilization of White's Queenside pawns.. My play here is, ironically, to offer White a number of plausible moves at each turn, but none of which is great, the better to help him go astray in the subtleties of the variations.} 28. Bxc8 {Oh, well this is just bad. White gets absolutely nothing but the loss of his Bishop from this unforced exchange, and so should have played 28. Ne4 instead, with the idea of Ng3! both covering the King and helping to support the advance of White's Kingside pawns. This is a finesse that many players - even good ones! - miss at times: a Knight on a square where it cannot be attacked with a pawn, is just about golden no matter where that post is. Case in point: Black's Knight on f4 is very well-placed, and will be difficult to dislodge.} Kxc8 29. Ne4 Rh7 {...Waiting.} 30. Nf6 {Stronger was 30. Ng3!, for reasons already mentioned.} Nh3+ {I have a free move, so I want to see what White does.} 31. Kg2 Nf4+ 32. Kg1 {White plays the waiting game in his turn. On 32. Kh1 I planned 32. ...Rf7 followed by ...Nh3.} Rg7+ 33. Kf1 {Surely not 33. Kh1 Nh3  34. Rg1?? Nf2 mate!} Rf7 34. Ne4 Rf8 {Preparing ...Nd5-e3, forking.} 35. Nd6+ {Another wasted move since White has no constructive follow-up.} Kc7 36. b5 {Still playing for the win. But the text is toothless. White should have played 36. c4 instead.} Nd5 37. Nc4 {White blocks the threat, but has to hem in his c-pawn to do it. Black consistently takes advantage of these small miscues by White, steadily improving his position with each one.} e4 {Of course 37.. ...cb5 is spoiled by 38. Rd5. The text threatens 38. ...e3! Black begins to assert himself now} 38. Ke1 {Rather unhappy is 38. Kg1 Nc3  39. Re1 (not Rd4?? Ne2, winning) cb5, after which Black's Queenside pawns are at least as good as White's Kingside pawns.} Rh8 39. bxc6 bxc6 40. Nd2 Rxh2 {Better was  40. ...Nf6!, guarding the e-pawn while still pocketing White's h-pawn.} 41. Nxe4 Rh4 {But Black's 40th move was not a mistake, per se, because now he makes hay against White's Queenside pawns.} 42. Nc5 Rc4 {White is now clearly on the defensive even though he is material up.} 43. Ne6+ Kd6 44. Nd4 Kc5 45. Nb3+ {Rather than repeating moves with another check at e6, White is *still* playing to win! Good fighting spirit!} Kd6 46. Rd2 Ke5 {With White's Rook hemmed in on the 2nd rank like that, Black's King can immediately initiate defensive action on the Kingside.} 47. Kf1 {A slightly puzzling move since 47. Re2+ at least threatens Re8-a8, menacing the only exploitable square in Black's camp, the pawn at a7.} c5 {Now 48. Re2 Kd6  49. Re8 Nc7, guarding the a8 square, after which White can play his Rook back to e2 or defend the c-pawn by playing Na1 - yuck!} 48. Kg2 Rg4+ 49. Kh3 Rc4 {The White King can't support the advance of the f-pawn if it can't get adjacent to it.} 50. f3 Rc3 51. Kg3 Nf6 {Threatening the fork on e4. Black's tactical resources seem to appear almost by magic each time he needs them. Not only that but now the Knight guards the weakness at e8 too.} 52. Re2+ Kf5 {Now it's Black's turn to be too aggressive: the e7 square is wide open.} 53. Rd2 {Oh my, I guess he just didn't see it! After 53. Re7 Rc2  54. Ra7 White is winning.} Ne4+ {And White abandoned the game.}
