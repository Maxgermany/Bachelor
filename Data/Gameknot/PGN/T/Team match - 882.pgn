[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C70), Graz variation"]

1. e4 {Starting the Ruy Lopez} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez achieved. Hoerah for me! } a6 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 {Pretty straightforward moves till here. } h6 {Very conservative move... maybe a bit too... } 6. O-O Bd6 {A bit questionable, coz it blocks the d pawn and the bishop is restricted by the e pawn...} 7. Bd5 {Time to test the waters... let's just start with a pin on the knight} Nge7 {Guess he doesn't want my bishop there} 8. Nc3 {Maybe he'll like my knight more...} Nxd5 9. Nxd5 Ne7 {Or maybe not...} 10. d4 exd4 {The move that gave me the advantage to exploit the underdeveloped center} 11. Qxd4 {aiming at g7} O-O {the king in the line of fire... I smell trouble...! } 12. Nf6+ {Kablam! If he takes the knight, a inevitable mating combination would follow with Qxf6 followed by Bxh6} Kh8 13. Bxh6 {2nd Kablam! Now the bishop is joining the attack. If black takes one of the pieces with the pawn, checkmate will follow. Victory is close! } Nc6 {Hmmm... this is actually the ONLY move black could make that would prolong his life in this game. Damn... But what about.....} 14. Bxg7+ {Exactly!... Bishop g7! Just sacrifise the bishop...} Kxg7 {Forced} 15. Nh5+ {Luring the king to the centre of the board} Kh6 {Kinda Forced...} 16. Qg7+ {And now it's time for another sacrifise} Kxh5 {Accepted... but now a forced mating combination will follow. } 17. Qh7+ Kg4 18. Qf5# {Game, set and match!  Thank you for watching! }
