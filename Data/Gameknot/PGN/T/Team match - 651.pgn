1. b3 {Someday I need to start a min-itournament for the Larsen-Nimzovich Attach.} d5 2. Bb2 Nf6 3. e3 Bg4 {This is something I've never seen in this opening.} 4. Nf3 e6 5. h3 Bxf3 {I didn't expect that, really.} 6. Qxf3 Nbd7 7. c4 {I decided to play c4 before I bring out the knight to help challenge d5.} c6 8. Be2 Bd6 9. O-O O-O 10. d4 e5 {I just did a lesson on different types of pawn centers. In a dynamic center, it has two pawns for each side in the center in a form that will eventually change and become one of the other four types of centers.} 11. Qf5 {I felt my queen was kind of blocked and needed to find a way to make it more active.} Qe7 12. Nc3 e4 13. cxd5 cxd5 {That pawn center has become a closed center (temporarily). But his pawn chain is more vulnerable than mine.} 14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. Qxd5 {And I} Nf6 16. Qf5 a6 17. Rac1 {Take that open file. And I like that my queen also controls c8.} g6 18. Qa5 Rac8 19. Rxc8 Rxc8 20. Rc1 Rxc1+ 21. Bxc1 Bc7 22. Qc5 Qxc5 23. dxc5 {All the big pieces have traded; now, the winner is going to be the person who can get another queen. I'm still a pawn up, but I'm worried that he might be able to block my king from getting to his side of the board.} Nd5 24. Bb2 Kf8 25. Bc4 Nb4 26. a3 Nc6 27. Bf6 {That turns out to be an important move because his knight is about to become an observer.} Bd8 28. Bxd8 Nxd8 29. Bd5 {Now he has no way to get the knight back into the game unless he wants to offer it as a trade.} f5 30. f3 exf3 31. gxf3 h6 32. Kf2 Ke7 {I still wasn't positive that I would be able to get my king to where it could help my pawns.} 33. f4 {That turns out to be an important move for me. It keeps his king from being able to attack my bishop.} Kf6 34. h4 {If he plays g5, I'll trade off the pawns and then bring the king up to f3 and f4.} Nc6 35. Bxc6 {He finally decided that the knight would never be any help to him, so he decided to make me decide what I wanted to do with it and my bishop. But I'd worked this out, and I was pretty certain that I could break through.} bxc6 36. h5 {There's the winning move.} g5 {He couldn't afford to take it. If he does, my king will head be able to over to the h-file to block them and take the pawns and then attack his pawns from behind. If his king goes over to the queenside, I play b4 so he has to go all the way down to a3 go take the pawns that block his while I take the pawn on f5 and easily queen that pawn. Or if puts his king on g6 to keep me from taking those pawns, my king blocks him from coming any further plus I'll trade my a and b pawns for his a and c pawns, and his king will be too far away to stop the c-pawn from queening.} 37. fxg5+ Kxg5 38. b4 Kf6 {Same thing. If he plays Kxh5, he'll be too far away to be able to stop my c-pawn.} 39. a4 Ke5 40. Kf3 Kd5 {I thought his best chance was to stay back on e6 or maybe f6, but I'd still figured out that I could swing around to the queenside and eventually get in that way.} 41. Kf4 Kc4 42. Kxf5 Kxb4 43. e4 Kxc5 44. e5 Kd5 45. Kf6 {}
