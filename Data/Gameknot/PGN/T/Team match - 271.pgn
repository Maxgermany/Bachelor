1. e4 e5 2. g3 {Already something odd, fianchettoing his bishop would be inadvisable due to the fact that his e pawn block the diagonal.} Nf6 {I develop normally.} 3. d3 {Again, odd, it blocks in his light square bishop but I'm assuming he's planning to fianchetto it.} d5 4. Bg5 dxe4 5. Bxf6 Qxf6 6. dxe4 {At this stage I think black has the edge due to the fact that he has his queen developed.} Bc5 {I develop with a threat} 7. Nf3 Bg4 8. Bg2 O-O 9.
