[Opening "Philidor (C41), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's Defense isn't supposed to lead to quick, smashing wins by BLACK. But with the genius of Alekhine, anything is possible!} 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. c3 {Too slow, and interferes with the development of the QN. Against Alekhine, you can't make these kind of small mistakes!} Bg4 {Alekhine was never one to be passive.} 5. Qb3 {Unpinning.} Qe7 6. Ng5 {This attack is easily repulsed, as the Q-side pieces are still undeveloped.} Nh6 7. Bxf7+ Nxf7 8. Nxf7 Qxf7 {White's "attack" is gone. Now Alekhine will prepare a devastating counterstrike.} 9. Qxb7 {Removing the Q from the defense, his only active piece. White would have been better served with a move such as 9 P-Q3, allowing the development of his Q-side pieces with B-K3 and N-Q2.} Kd7 10. Qxa8 {At least he has the consolation of winning some material before being buried by Black's coming onslaught.} Qc4 {Threatening mate on the move with ...Q-K7! White's undeveloped Q-side is useless.} 11. f3 Bxf3 12. gxf3 Nd4 {Renewing the mate threat.} 13. d3 Qxd3 {Sacrificing the Knight as well. But if mate is in the offing...} 14. cxd4 Be7 {White overlooks the threat. 15 K-B2 is the only way to prolong the game.} 15. Qxh8 {Blinded by greed.} Bh4# {Proving that material is less important than skill. Well done by the young Alekhine.}
