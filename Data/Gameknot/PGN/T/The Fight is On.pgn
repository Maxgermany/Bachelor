1. d4 d5 {Closed Game. Let's see what white has in mind.} 2. c4 dxc4 {Queen's Gambit. I'll accept. The fight is on.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 a6 {Chances are, someone who knows the QGA better than I do can tell me why I played this. I either got this from a book reference or the GK DB, I don't recall which, but it doesn't seem to offer much for black other than supporting an eventual b5 after the inevitable Bxc4.} 5. Bxc4 e6 6. O-O b5 {Hmm, as predicted. Was this the only reason for 4. ... a6?} 7. Bd3 c5 8. Qe2 cxd4 {I was tempted by 8. ... c4 chasing the bishop, but I decided to go for isolating a white pawn on the d-file instead.} 9. exd4 Nc6 {And then attacking it.} 10. a4 bxa4 11. Rxa4 Nb4 {Black is sorely under-developed. I might have been better off with a developing move instead of this premature aggression.} 12. Bb5+ Bd7 {Not 12. ... axb5? allowing 13. Rxa8.} 13. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {Well, this worked out OK, black has regained ground with developing and even has a weak attack on the white rook on a4.} 14. Nc3 h6 {g5 looks too tempting for either white bishop or knight, so let's keep them both off of it.} 15. Bf4 Be7 {Thinking about castling, though it turns out that I never actually do.} 16. Rd1 Nbd5 17. Rxa6 Rxa6 {I don't see how white can come out of this without losing material.} 18. Bxh6 Rb6 {18. Bxh6 was unexpected. True, the white bishop was en prise and about to fall after 18. Qxa6, but it looks like this move, while gaining a pawn, allows black's rook to escape capture.} 19. Bxg7 Rg8 {Black's rook on h8 was en prise, it had to be saved, and this move indirectly skewers the white bishop to white's king, an the pawn at g2 - a fact that will quickly become relevant.} 20. Ne5 Qb7 {Black's queen was en prise. On b7, she supports the rook's attack against the white pwn on b2. But she also has a second, thinly veiled, threat.} 21. Bxf6 Nxc3 {Now white's queen is en prise, and his rook is forked too. But when the knight moved, it exposed a discovered attack against g2, threatening mate in 1. At this point, black expected white to play 22. Qf1 or 22. Qf3. Both moves stop the checkmate and save the white queen, but both moves also lose the rook at d1. Still, they're all that white has.} 22. bxc3 Qxg2# {Nope, capturing the black knight with 22. Bxc3??? was not the right answer, and frankly, was rather unexpected. Maybe white didn't want to continue on, being down two rooks for three pawns.}
