1. e4 {A  fun game I played with coppe. He always plays a great game} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3 {It looks like a Guoico piano.} Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 5. h3 d6 6. Be2 a6 {I was more concerned with having a place to move the bishop back to than I was with defending the b5 square.} 7. Bg5 {Pinning the knight to the queen.} O-O 8. b4 Ba7 9. Na3 {The queen knight enters the game.} Be6 {Mostly just to get his lazy ass to work!} 10. Nc2 h6 11. Be3 Bxe3 {I'd rather just get rid of you than worry about keeping that diagonal.} 12. Nxe3 Ne7 {I am turning out to be a real knight player, who used to think that the bishops are more powerful. Having both bishops is great, but how about having both knights?} 13. Qc2 Qd7 14. Nf1 Kh8 15. Ne3 Rfg8 16. Nh2 g5 17. Nhg4 {Some real action on the king side.} Rg6 18. f3 Nh5 {It looks like he did that to over protect his pawn. but he opened up a great square for my knight. He always wanted to be an outpost.} 19. Kf2 Nf4 {A knight firmly entrenched as both a blockade and an outpost. } 20. Rag1 f5 21. Nh2 {Chased the knight away.} Rag8 22. Ke1 h5 23. c4 Kg7 {I had to do it! I just didn't feel like mixing it up with the pawns, and having a rook or two coming down the rook file toward my king.} 24. g4 {First strike!} fxg4 {And the fight is on!} 25. hxg4 h4 {I think it was the right time to lock it up.} 26. Qb2 Nc6 {Headed for a land of opportunity.} 27. Nhf1 Nd4 {Oh glory! an outpost and a blockade like his brother!} 28. Rh2 Nxf3+ {He resigned. If he takes my bishop Nxp is a killer knight fork.}
