[Opening "Grob (A00), Fritz gambit"]

1. g4 {I rarely see this opening, and I think the last time I remember seeing it was from studying a 19th century game. I'm sure the pawn is bait ...} d5 {... but I think I can play this to my advantage, so I move out to the center and threaten to take the baited pawn.} 2. Bg2 Bxg4 {I take the bait and ...} 3. c4 {... white offers another poisoned pawn. Having studied this opening in a 19th century game, I know not to take the second pawn. If I do, the white bishop takes b7 and then takes a8 one move later. For the gain of two pawns, black loses a pawn and a rook.} Be6 {I pull the bishop back to protect my own pawn. This move block's the king's pawn and hence makes it harder for my dark square bishop to get out and join the fight.} 4. Qa4+ {I guessed white would bring the queen out early to put me in check. Possible responses are to bring back the bishop to d7 and threaten the queen, move the knight to c6 to block the queen's attack, block with my own queen, or use a lowly pawn. Regardless of black's move, I suspect white will move the queen to b4 and threaten the unprotected b7 pawn.} c6 5. Qb4 {I'm not surprised at the queen move. My options are to push the b7 pawn or move the queen to protect it.} b6 6. cxd5 Bxd5 7. Bxd5 {White decides to take out black's bishop, take control over the center, and have a momentary advantage in material. Here, I can retake white's bishop with the pawn and be 1 pawn up, but that advantage is too momentary since white can go Qb5+ Nd7, Qxd5 followed by either e6 or Nf6.} e6 {Surprise #1! I can threaten the bishop and queen in one move.} 8. Bxc6+ {A logical way for white to regain tempo and avoid losing the bishop when moving the queen.} Nxc6 {Now I have two threats on the white queen. A goal for the next few moves is to get my queen onto the main diagonal where I can take out the exposed rook on h1.} 9. Qb5 Qc7 10. Nf3 {White moves pieces to put pressure on the pinned black knight.} Bc5 {Move the bishop out so I can use the other black knight for support.} 11. Ne5 Nge7 {Not only is my second knight ready to provide support to the first but the king can now castle to safety.} 12. Nxc6 Nxc6 {A predictable exchange of knights.} 13. e3 O-O {And the king moves to safety thus allowing the pinned knight to move freely.} 14. f4 a6 {Black develops a pawn and puts pressure on the white queen.} 15. Qd3 Rfd8 {The rook takes control over the half-open file and puts more pressure on the white queen.} 16. Qe4 Nb4 {The knight moves towards the tempting c2 square where it can fork the king and rook. Unfortunately, there is a queen protecting that spot, so I shall have to move the bishop out of the way of my own queen first.} 17. a3 {But white obviously doesn't want my knight that close.} Nd5 18. Rg1 {Looks like white is planning a kingside attack with the rook and queen.} Nf6 {I move the knight over to kingside. In retrospect, I could have left the knight on d5 and sacrificed the bishop with an attack on e3. If white retakes e3 to prevent me from taking the rook on g1, then my queen has an open shot at the white bishop on c1. That would force the white king to move to f2 to protect the rook against another queen attack. I could then have move the rook from d8 to d1 to further threaten the white rook on g1.} 19. Qg2 {White lines up the queen for a mate threat.} g6 {So I have to push the pawn forward.} 20. h4 a5 21. h5 Nxh5 {Woohoo! Free pawn!} 22. Qg5 {But the cost of taking the free pawn is the loss of tempo. If I don't move the knight now, white will take it for free with the queen. The pinned pawn on g6 offers no support for the knight.} Ng7 23. Qh6 Bf8 {Move the bishop out of the way of my queen.} 24. Rh1 {Very serious mate threat here.} Qxc1+ {Surprise #2! This is the move I should have done 6 moves sooner - if I saw the bishop sacrifice back then.} 25. Ke2 {King moves to safety.} Qxh1 {I must must sacrifice the queen by taking the rook to remove the mate threat. If Qc4+ instead, the king would just move to safety again and my own queen would have no recourse for stopping the mate threat.} 26. Qxh1 {At this point, both sides are "even" in material in that both have the same sum of points of pieces on the board. However, I'd say black has two advantages. One advantage is that black has more pieces, and therefore more ability to project power. The second advantage is that black has developed more pieces.} Nf5 {Move the knight out so it can go to the g3 square and fork the king and queen.} 27. Qc6 {I guess white saw the fork and also saw the unprotected pawn on b6.} Rab8 {Move rook to protect pawn. In hindsight, I could have also move the bishop out to protect it, but at the time I was thinking of moving the bishop to g7 so it can attack white's unprotected pawn.} 28. Nc3 Rdc8 {Once again, I move a rook to take over an open file and to scare the queen away.} 29. Qe4 {With the queen there, I can now do my knight fork like I planned 3 moves ago. I guess white didn't see the knight fork potential back then.} Ng3+ {After Surprise #3 white decided to honorably resign. Upon reviewing the game, I noticed white moved the queen in 11 out of 29 turns. White's tactics depended on using the queen often, and thereby placing the queen in high risk positions. I usually responded to the queen moves by developing rooks, minor pieces, and pawns. 6 of the white queen moves were in response to threats against her so she was often moving defensively. By move 26, white still had two undeveloped pieces while black's pieces were projecting power over many squares.}
