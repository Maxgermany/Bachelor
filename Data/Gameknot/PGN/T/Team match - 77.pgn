1. c4 {English opening.} d5 2. cxd5 Qxd5 {Draws the queen out early.} 3. Nc3 Qe6 4. e3 {Pe4 is covered by Nc3 and won't bury the black bishop.} Nf6 5. Bb5+ Bd7 6. a4 Bxb5 7. axb5 {NxPb5 instead sets up a lovely king/queen/rook fork.  Black can defend against it, but white retains mobility.} Nbd7 8. Ra4 {It seems a little early for advancing rooks.  Nf3 instead sets up O-O and can launch attacks against the queen.  When the queen is out, she can be chaste while the opposing team develops.} Nc5 9. Rf4 {Yikes!  Nd3+ gives black that rook.  This illustrates a weakness in early rook deployment.} Nd3+ 10. Kf1 Nxf4 11. exf4 Qf5 12. g3 e5 13. Qe1 O-O-O 14. b6 axb6 15. Nf3 exf4 16. gxf4 Qxf4 17. Ne2 {Nf3 is undefended, as in QxNf3.} Qc4 18. Kg2 Qg4+ 19. Ng3 Bb4 20. Ne5 {Nice.  NxPf7 forks the rooks.} Qe6 {Black counters that threat.} 21. Qe2 Rd4 22. d3 Re8 23. Bd2 {23 QxB2 withdraws support from Ne5.  White is ill advised to propose even material exchanges.} Bxd2 24. Qxd2 Qxe5 25. Re1 {QxR, QxR, RxQ, and black picks up d & b pawns at leisure.} Qb5 26. Re3 Red8 27. Re1 Rd4xd3 28. Qc2 c6 29. Re3 Rd3d2 30. Ra3 Rxc2 31. Ra8+ Kc7 32. Ra3 Qxb2 33. Rf3 Rd1 34. Kh3 g5 35. Rf5 Nd5 36. Rxf7+ {Black's resignation makes little sense, save that the IHS team may have already won three so the outcome here was irrelevant. A quick end might help them jockey for position on the ladder, while suppressing Letiana's rating, making it easier to match her against weaker players. }
