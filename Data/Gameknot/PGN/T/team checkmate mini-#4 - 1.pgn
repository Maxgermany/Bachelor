1. d4 {Greetings all. This is a game where i tried the opening of 1.d4. Normally i dont in longer games but I'm, debating switching over to either d4 or e4 so I play a lot of blitz. } Nf6 2. c4 e6 {...not to pushed into given open names and theory but white now typically decides between Nc3 or Nf3..I've seen some recent games of Kramnik and liked the Catalan set up...so was thinking to head for this.} 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. Qc2 {...after g3 I have to use the lady here....} Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Bxc4 {..free pawn but I'll just keep going with the development and get things central...black could keep it moving with ...c5  / dc & Bxc5, castle and the bishops are nicely placed.} 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. O-O Bxc3 9. bxc3 O-O 10. Re1 {..getting ready for the push...will look to get the rooks connected and Bishop into play} d5 11. Nd2 {..time to kick the Bishop but more so to dominate with e4} Na5 12. Nxc4 Nxc4 13. Qd3 {...time to move the Q to the centre and stir up the fun. Black is a pawn up but white has the bishop pair and the position will open up....even if i have to sac another pawn to do so..} Rc8 14. e4 c5 {...maybe Bg5 might have been better but h6 just kicks it...} 15. e5 {..i do gain a little space...} Nd7 16. Qe2 {...now looking at Qg4 & bring in the bishop..} cxd4 17. cxd4 b5 18. Qg4 f5 {...has to be..} 19. exf6 e.p. Nxf6 20. Qxe6+ Kh8 {...unfortunately it recovers the pawn..} 21. Bg5 {...and will now gain the other...} Qd6 {..so the next combo wins the d5 pawn...} 22. Qxd6 Nxd6 23. Bxf6 Rxf6 24. Bxd5 {....ok...a pawn up..but its an open position and White has a bishop...} Nf5 25. Bb7 {...mini trap if Rb8..d5...(Q Oh no..?? dropped a bishop?!!!..Er..no. Rxb7 & curtains with Re8 )...white now gains a square for the d5 pawn} Rd8 26. Rad1 Rfd6 27. d5 a5 28. Bc6 {..still a traps here for black...backrank threats with combo such as ..Bxb5 Rxd5, Rxd5 winning the piece as R8xd5 => Re8# !} b4 29. f4 {solidify the position and get the king moving...} g6 30. Kf2 Kg7 {...bump the knight and possible invasion begins..} 31. g4 Nh4 {...Nh6 probably better...mini plot might be to lure the white king some trap} 32. Kg3 g5 33. fxg5 Ng6 34. h4 {..should be able to bump the knight now..} Rf8 35. h5 Nh8 36. Re7+ {...hello Kingy....need to get rid of the artillary and make the extra dangerous pawn count ...} Rf7 37. Re6 {...black has to take...retreating only allows the pawn to adavance and threaten Re7} Rxe6 38. dxe6 {...black is limited to the square..anywhere on the 7th rank secures the pawn...Ill take with the bishop as the knight is paralysed...Black will suffer material losses to stay in the game but the result is not in doubt from here...} Rc7 {...} 39. Rd7+ {...all set for his majesty to get to f5...} Rxd7 40. Bxd7 Kf8 41. Kf4 Ke7 42. Kf5 {...hello f5...Black is in zugzwang.. Interesting game.....i'm sure there are better moves in there, but tis rare i play d4 long games...}
