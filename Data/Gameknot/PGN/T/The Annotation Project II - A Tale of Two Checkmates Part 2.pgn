1. f4 {Hi everyone!  About 48 hours after getting Freddied again I had a more pleasant surprise from Gameknot as I woke up this morning.  I had set up two conditional moves, both of them led to my opponent copping Old Matey and my opponent had played into one of them.  I may ask you, the Inquest Jury, to spot the other one and e-mail me the answer on a postcard.  This is the Annotations Project Part 2 and my second victory with the white pieces.  We start the action on move 8 where my opponent plays the virtually standard Kc6. } d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 {8. ..... Kc6 - see intro note.} 9. Bxg4 e5 {9. ......... e5 - my opponent likes my move (I have played this twice as black and won one game with it) so he plays it!} 10. Nf7 Qf6 11. Nxe5+ {11. Nxe5+ - I somehow see this check as a little bit stronger than taking the rook on h8.  At least I narrow the deficit to two material points.} Kc5 12. Nc3 {12. Nc3 - out comes the other knight.} Qe7 13. Nxe4+ {13. Nxe4+ - the other central pawn drops off and I land another check.} Kb6 14. d4 {14. d4 - a good time to play this line opener, especially with the absence of the e pawns!} c6 15. O-O Bg7 {15. ...... Bg7! - develops his bishop to g7 - a strong move} 16. Be3 {16. Be3 - and I respond by clearing the decks.} Bxe5 17. dxe5+ {17. dxd5+ - he trades off his dsb however and gives me a central and well supported passer - it is also check.  This passer is gonna be a killer.} Kc7 {17. ....... Kc7 - he hides his king but you will not believe this, his queen knight and his QR will not move at all.} 18. Bc5 Qf7 19. e6 {19. e6 - passed pawns must be pushed.} Qg7 20. c3 {20. c3 - prevents Qxb2.} b6 21. Bd4 {21. Bd4 - skewer.} Qf8 22. Bxh8 {22. Bxh8 - tvm.} Qxh8 23. f5 {23. f5 - supporting the passer.} gxf5 24. Rxf5 {24. Rxf5 - I decide to take back with the rook.} Na6 25. Rf7+ {25. Rf7+ - closing in.} Kd8 {25. ...... Kd8 - allows #2 but I think he is busted whatever he does.} 26. e7+ {26. e7+ - one square from Glendadom} Ke8 27. Nd6# {27. Nd6 MATE!! - If black plays 26. ...... Kc7 instead of Kc8 there is a checkmate to be found.  An exercise for the Inquest Jury.  Spot the checkmate and if you are happy with your answer and would like to let me know then please send me a pm.  Cheers and bye for now - Joanne}
