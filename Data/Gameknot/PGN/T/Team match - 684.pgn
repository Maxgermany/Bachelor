1. e4 {..this is a game played for team Checkmate. Joined a team and discover you will be pitted against lads & lassies of near to your level...so...1.e4..Normally I will entertain a Sicilian for stronger players and this was no different. Replies to e4 are a matter of taste..Sicilian suits an attacking player...like me.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {..classic Siclilian Najdorf...so which maze was white going to go down..?} 6. h3 {....what the f.. Cool so, black gains a tempo already i thought and develops...white needs to consider f4,Be2 or Be3, Bg5 and the like...h3 prevents the unlikely early Bg4...and thats it..?!} e5 7. Nf3 {...Nb3 is more normal} Be7 8. Bc4 Qc7 {...just developing....} 9. Bd5 Nc6 10. O-O O-O 11. Re1 {..i'm looking at white and Black is slightly better maybe...almost complete development to begin traditional queenside mayhem...!} Rb8 12. Bg5 b5 13. a3 {..was expecting Bxf6..Ba2 and then plonk the donkey into d5...} h6 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. Na2 {...??} Ne7 16. b3 {...a sense of deja vu.... ?? white is not developing...you must attack black otherwise it is quick in blacks advantage} Nxd5 17. Qxd5 Be6 {...all developed...bishop pair, connected rooks..weak pawn on c2...Sweet...} 18. Qd3 a5 19. Rad1 Rfd8 20. Nc3 b4 21. axb4 axb4 22. Na2 {....again white declines the opportunity to get the donkey into d5..so now tis time to make some fun..} Be7 23. Rdc1 {...basically I am preparing the central push...with Rdc1, where does the knight goto..?} d5 24. exd5 Rxd5 {..so now white is in trouble...the knight is a total weak point...I can double quickly on the a-file and its good knight irene from here...Qe2 should be played i think but...} 25. Qe4 {..thanks...just won the major actively superb file ...the a-file...!!} Ra5 {..hello knight..} 26. Rca1 Rba8 {..strong presence...} 27. Nxb4 Ra5xa1 28. Nd3 {..no idea what this was for...I'm rook for pawn up and there is a pawn en prise....your majesty, your wanted on c2...} Qxc2 29. Rxa1 Rxa1+ 30. Kh2 {...so looking at it...black is in a completely won game ...a rook up and beautiful bishops...against awkward donkeys...} Qxb3 31. g3 {...so from here in, its all about making your material count, ie get pieces off the board...connect the queen and rook and seek mate...simple plan...so I will even sac material back for the mate...} Bd5 32. Qe3 Bxf3 33. Qxf3 Qb1 {..the final blow....white has no defenses at this point..h4 is answered by Qg1 , Kh3 Qh1 , QxQ RxQ, Kg2  and the lovely e4...whites queen cant move to protect the knight soQg1# White had better options in the opening...which was a cause of a quick win...}
