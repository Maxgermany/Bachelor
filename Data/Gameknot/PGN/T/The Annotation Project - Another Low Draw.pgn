1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It's back to the old routine for me, passivitis just does not go away.  I get into some big bother yet again but somehow I avoid a heavy points loss yet again but find myself conceding another low draw.  My assessment of the final position was that I thought my defense around Henry would be able to hold but I could do no more than that - I had just about enough wood for the absent Glenda, a R + B + P (although the P was a passer) I thought that the Wicked Witch of the West and her castle were very threatening indeed and I thought that if I wasn't careful the Witch could get in some really nasty checks.  I decided that I could live with the loss of 5 rating points and offered the draw which my opponent, Steve kindly accepted.  As you are all familiar with the other annotated games I will start the action at Move 9.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6 {9. ....... e6 - my opponent chooses to play his pawn to e6.} 10. Bxe6 {10. Bxe6 - and I choose to take it.} Qf6 {10. ...... Qf6 - and out comes the Witch!} 11. O-O {11. 0-0 - and I now tuck Henry away on the kingside.} h6 12. Nf7 {12. Nf7 - my knight and bishop are en prise, the best thing I can do is attack the rook on h8.  I really do need to develop my queenside but as I am behind on material I do not want to go any further behind!} Nd7 13. Bxd7+ Kxd7 {13. ........ Kxd7 - I trade off one of my attacked pieces with tempo.  Now I remove the rook.} 14. Nxh8 {14. Nxh8 - rook removed.} Bd6 15. Nc3 {15. Nc3 - development.} Rxh8 16. Ne2 {16. Ne2 - guards f4 pawn.} Rf8 17. d3 exd3 18. cxd3 {18. cxd3 - pawn trade.} g5 19. g3 {19. g3 - my f4 pawn is pinned against Qxf1#! so I cannot take on g5.  I defend it again.} gxf4 20. Nxf4 {20. Nxf4 - pawn trade.} Qd4+ 21. Kh1 {21. Kh1 - Henry moves out of check.  I wish I could bring out Fou Lenoir but my b2 pawn will be hanging and the Witch will be allowed to invade my position.  So I prepare it with 22. Rb1.} h5 22. Rb1 h4 {22. ....... h4 - danger on the g and h files.  I now release Fou Lenoir from the protection of the b2 pawn with b3.  Fou Lenoir is desperately needed to defend my horsie on f4.} 23. b3 Qh8 24. Kg2 {24. Kg2 - Henry sidestepps a dangerous pin.} Qg8 25. Be3 {25. Be3 - I now complete my development on MOVE 25!} hxg3 26. hxg3 {26. hxg3 - pawn trade.} Bxf4 27. Bxf4 {27. Bxf4 - now a piece trade - I only have the Witch and her castle to contend with now but together they are a very dangerous force.  Can my pieces provide a good enough shield for Henry?  We shall see.} Qd5+ 28. Rf3 {28. Rf3 - don't like walking into a pin but I must keep that Witch out!} Rh8 29. g4 {29. g4 - pushes my passer one square closer to Glendadom and more crucially opens a defensive line from Fou Lenoir to h2.} Qg8 30. g5 {30. g5 - my passer is attacked by the Witch.  He moves still closer to Glendadom and seeks protection from Fou Lenoir.} Qh7 {30. ........ Qh7 - ominous doubling on the h column.} 31. Rg1 {31. Rg1 - my other rook now comes into play.  If Henry is compelled to move from g2 then my passer will have protection from the back on the way to Glendadom (g8).} Qe7 32. Re3 {32. Re3 - stops Qe2+ - rook protected by Fou Lenoir.} Qf7 {32. Qf7 - attacks Fou Lenoir.} 33. Rf1 {33. Rf1 - before I moved the rook here my opponent expressed some frustration at being unable to get at Henry.  I hope this move holds things together.  To test this theory I decided to offer my opponent a draw - reason for this - see my intro note.  To my intense relief he is content to bag 5 rating points.  I have some of my other active games which look promising and hope to convert at least one of them to make up the lost points here.  Hope you have had a good read.  Cheers and bye for now - Joanne}
