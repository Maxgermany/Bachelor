[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 {good response - get a foothold and open Q and B lines} 2. Bc4 {thats unusual but ok - N out first is better} Nf6 {good response - develop with a threat} 3. d3 Bc5 {another good developing move} 4. Nf3 Ng4 {At best this is a wasted move. We have all made this move - once. The reasons why not - 1. it encourages white to develop while defending easily by 0-0  2.  N is vulnerable here and will have to spend another move to get back to f6 (two free moves for white) 3. it loses N and a pawn for B if white plays Bxf7  4. it neglects development  for an inconclusive attack} 5. Bxf7+ {there is no need for white to grab the pawn, he can continue with development and stay comfortably ahead. But anyway !} Kxf7 6. Ng5+ Kg6 {This is a really bad idea. It makes no sense for K to go walking in open country especially with QxN coming next.} 7. Qxg4 Qf8 {The blunder that kills off black. Any other Q move works (sort of !) (except QxN) but the discovered check was obvious, so its a matter of looking at the possible damage a free N move can cause (really, white can cash-in his 2 free moves here). Kg6 lost at least a piece but Qf8 turned it into loss of Q. } 8. Ne6+ Kf7 9. Qf5+ Ke7 10. Nxf8 Rxf8 11. Bg5+ Kd6 {There is not a lot to say now.} 12. Qxf8+ Kc6 13. Qxc8 Bd4 14. c3 {You are right to resign here. If the position is hopeless and you can see no way forward there is nothing else to do. Regardless of material down, if you can see a way to draw or win, or if your opponent does not demonstrate to you that he can win, then by all means continue, it's up to you. }
