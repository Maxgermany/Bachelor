[Opening "Petrov (C42), Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {The Petroff, a line I play myself. This was remarkably the second time I encountered it in one week, the game I played the day before (also for the external league but for another team) also started off with the Petroff, I was White in that game as well.} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 {This is the variation I find the hardest to meet as Black. It's solid but White can also get a quick attack going if Black isn't careful.} d5 {?! Apparently my opponent didn't know this variation. He thought for 2,5 minutes and came up with this dubious move. I guess he overlooked my next move...} 6. Qe2 {! A slightly counter-intuitive move as it temporarily blocks in the bishop, but White wins a pawn.} Be6 {?! This is another inaccuracy from my opponent. After 6...Be7 Black can at least castle after the exchanges on e4 and will then start to think of getting some real compensation for his pawn deficit. 6...f5?? is far worse due to 7.d3 winning a whole knight, and 6...Qe7?? is even worse than that because 7.Nxd5 not only wins a pawn, but also the knight on e4 as Black has to move his queen and can't defend the knight anymore (7..Qe6?? 8.Nxc7+ wins the queen).} 7. Nxe4 dxe4 8. Qxe4 c6 {8...Qd5 was preferable. Now Black also gets an isolated pawn on an open file.} 9. Bc4 {I thought during the game that 9.Nd4 would accomplish the same thing (an isolated e-pawn for Black), and it but now that I think of it 9...Qd5 seems to be a good counter. The reason why I chose this move during the game was because the knight on f3 was already developed and I wanted to develop another piece.} Qe7 10. Bxe6 Qxe6 {Black forces an exchange of queens, hoping the queenless middlegame will be easier to defend then the position with queens on the board (10...fxe6). Personally I would have chosen the latter, probably.} 11. Qxe6+ fxe6 12. d4 Bd6 13. O-O Na6 {Planning to defend his weak pawn with ...Nc7.} 14. Re1 Nc7 15. Ng5 {I'm piling up on the pawn, but I can't really take it as we'll see.} O-O 16. g3 {Now 16.Nxe6?? would have been impossible as 16...Rfe8 pins and wins the knight. However, this move doesn't remove the pin. Therefore, 16.Ne4 was better, with a plan similar to what I played two moves later.} Rae8 {Puts the rook in a passive spot. I can imagine Black didn't like the look of 16...Rad8 with a knight looking at e6, but as mentioned before I can still not take it.} 17. c4 {!? Fine, but again 17.Ne4 was possible.} h6 {?! Forcing me to do just what I already should have done. Up to this point, we had both played rather quickly: I had 1 hour and 15 minutes left (we started with 1:40 + 10 seconds increment per move), my opponent had 1 hour and 12 minutes.} 18. Ne4 Be7 19. Bf4 {! More pressure on the already cramped Black position.} Bd8 {Better was 19...Rc8. This loses another pawn and is very passive.} 20. Nd6 Re7 21. Nxb7 Rxf4 {? Sacrificing an exchange... For what? Well, my pawn structure on the kingside is wrecked and my strong bishop is eliminated, but Black just doesn't get enough for this.} 22. gxf4 {Equally strong was 22.Nxd8!? Rf6 23.Nxc6 with three pawns more and an easy win. However, I was not sure if my d4 pawn wouldn't be lost. We both had about an hour left on our clocks here.} Rd7 23. Nxd8 {I didn't want the Black bishop on f6 so I decided to simply exchange it.} Rxd8 24. Re4 Kf7 25. Rae1 g6 {! Stiffest, I think. Black can't allow f5.} 26. b4 a6 27. a4 {Trying to force a breakthrough on the queenside, because the centre and the kingside are now locked. I guess Black was hoping he could hold up the queenside as well when he sacrificed the exchange. Another plan was to get the king involved: 27.Kg2.} Rd7 28. Rd1 Kf6 29. Re5 Rd6 {Slowly White is making progress. Black can only sit and wait for White to do something. The computer's suggestion here is 29...Ke7. I was spending some time here, I had 38 minutes left against 44 for my opponent.} 30. b5 {?! This doesn't throw away the win, but it was not quite the right moment for this break, as we will see. 30.Kg2 had to be preferred.} axb5 31. cxb5 cxb5 32. axb5 Nd5 {! The toughest defence, establishing a strong knight, threatening some forks and a pawn on f4. I can't defend it as 33.Re4?? fails to 33...Nc3 winning an exchange.} 33. Rb1 Rb6 {! Black is accurate again. The immediate 33...Nxf4? is worse because 34.b6 creates lots of problems for Black. After 34...Rd8 35.b7 the other White rook will help the b-pawn promote.} 34. Kg2 {Allowing the capture of the f-pawn, even with check. 34.Re4?? was still impossible due to 34...Nc3.} Nxf4+ 35. Kf3 Nd5 36. Rb2 {To prevent forks on c3 (36.Ke4?? was impossible due to 36...Nc3+). Also this gives me the option of moving my rook to the c-file should Black move his rook off the b6 square to support my pawn in another way.} Kf7 37. Ke4 {Preparing my next move (I had already seen this plan around move 33 or so, of course without concrete variations).} Kf6 {I had expected 37...Rd6 to discourage my next move. The computer's suggestion here is 37...Ke7.} 38. Rxd5 {! Sacrificing back the exchange to reach a rook ending that wins easily. I had 20 minutes left on my clock here. I suspect that Black had not expected this move, given the time he took to consider the (quite obvious) reply.} exd5+ 39. Kxd5 Ke7 {This is why 37...Ke7 was better than 37...Kf6. Had his king already been on e7, he would have a tempo extra so he could play 39...Kd7 now to slow down my advancement.} 40. Kc5 Rb8 41. Kc6 {? This doesn't throw away anything, but my job would have been somewhat harder if Black had now played 41...Rc8+. I should not have allowed that.} Kd8 {? Fortunately he didn't. The rest was easy.} 42. b6 Kc8 43. b7+ Kd8 44. d5 {Black resigned. He fought for what he was worth, but the game was practically over around move 10, as he admitted afterwards. Nevertheless he gave me a run for my money and I think he deserves credits for his fighting spirit and stiff resistance in a losing position. thanks to my opponent for the game, thanks to you all for reading my annotation and please leave some comments.}
