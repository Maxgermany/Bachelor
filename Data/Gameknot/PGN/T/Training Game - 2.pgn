[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf"]

1. e4 {After a while of figuring out when I'd have time to coach Simon, he challenged me to this game.  I was given the white pieces and started off with the usual.  Of course, I wasn't sure how black would respond.  But, I was happy to see him answer with the Sicilian since that's my main defense.  Thus, I know how to play against it.} c5 2. Nf3 {So, I turn it into the Open Variation, as my coach, Jack Stockel has taught me and made me remember.} d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {It winds up being what I have the most experience with being the Sicilian Nadjorf.} 6. Bd3 {So, I continue development.  Of course, the idea is to castle, ASAP.} e5 {But, Simon asked what the best response is.  For him, it was the options of 6...e6?! or 6...e5  I told him that 6...e6 is not a great move because it limits the mobility of his Bc1.  The idea is developing and then finding good squares for it.  That's especially because of how many squares your B covers.  6...Be6 only covers one square for the B, but 6...e5 covers 5 squares, which is better.  So, I said that 6...e5 is a much better move because it gives the B more mobility.  Plus, it gains tempo by attacking my N, and there is a nice pawn chain this early in the game.  It's worth noting that this pawn chain is very similar to what you see in a variation of the French defense, where you hit the N with the exact same move.  It's known to give black a very slight edge at this phase of the game.  } 7. Nb3 {Instead of retreating back to it's original square, I played this.  The idea being is that 7.Nf3 might walk into a pin since black could answer with 7...Bg4.  I don't like being pinned that way at all and have been known to be too passive about breaking it.  My thinking is why break the pin when it can be prevented?  } b5 {This gives black another pawn chain.  The only issue is that it doesn't develop, but it's certainly not enough to make note of since it's not, by any means, a mistake or blunder.  Meanwhile, I'm still determined to castle.} 8. O-O Nc6 {Continuing with his development.} 9. Bg5 {And, I complete mine by pinning his N.} Be7 {Similarly, Simon continues developing by breaking the pin.  The only issue is that his DSB is now limited and doesn't cover a lot of squares.  By this, I'm saying that it's not as mobile as my B's.  It doesn't make a huge difference in this game, but in general, that's something to take note of.} 10. Qd2 {Not that I have castled and developed, I felt that it was time to get my Q in action.  My original idea behind this was to allow something like 11.Bh6?, as then after 11...gxh6 I would have what appears to be a King side assault with 12.Qh6 and then 13.Qg7.  So, I almost played 11.Bh6?, but I figured out that this won't work because black would stop that with 12...Rg8.  My initial thinking was that if he did that, I'd play 13.Qxg8+??  I figured out that this doesn't work because of where black's N is located, as then, I'd be lost losing a and the Q for a R which leaves me the equivalent of two pieces down.  Thus, 11.Bh6? loses a pawn, outright.  So, the secondary reason for playing this move, which works, is that it connects both of my R's which is also an important part of the game.} O-O {Thinking that I might play 11.Bh6? Simon castles.  Even though I won't, this is still a good move since K safety.} 11. h3 {Worried that Simon would exchange and then go for a K side attack with 11...Ng4, I play this.  The idea being is that after 11...Ng4, and then 12.Bxe7, Qxe7, he might then try 13...Qh4 which threatens.  And, this would be forced.  But, rather then wait until the moment has come, I decided to prevent that threat because even if I took care of it later on, Jack Stockel has emphasized that N's are very dangerous once they surpass a certain point.  In fact, we will see an example of that later on.} d5 {? I said, up until now, your play was flawless, Simon. But, this move is a mistake. I understand the intention, as the idea is pinning my Nc3. As now, your Be7 also covers more square. But, this is going to cost you a pawn. Better was 11...Bb7 which completes your development and fianchettos.} 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. exd5 Nb4 {Given what has occurred, Simon is trying to win back a pawn.} 14. Be4 {But, I put a stop to that.} Bg5 {I am not surprised to see Simon trying to win my Q.  But, I, as you'd expect, protect.} 15. Qd1 f5 {That's when he hits my B.  Once I defend again...} 16. Bf3 e4 17. Be2 f4 {? He plays this.  This is a mistake that loses another pawn and where I used the lessons with the blitz Q sac for Simon.  jkarp: ? Advancing that loses another pawn. As the e4 pawn was protected before advancing the f5 pawn.  wrytry: Thank you I really appreciate your comments to help me improve my game  jkarp: You're welcome. My goal is to help you improve in any shape, way, or form.  I later emphasized this when it was over, and I summed up what happened including this move.  } 18. Nxe4 Nxd5 {?? This capture looks like Simon has gotten back a pawn.  But, this is loses, as I am about to win a piece, instead.  I didn't say anything else, at this point because he was two pawns down.  When you get that far behind, there's almost no good moves left as ION has illustrated.  As archduke_piccolo has told me that you coach up until you're winning or have a clear advantage.  But, then, it doesn't pay to coach anymore.  Well, I felt that I had a clear advantage because of what's to happen.  It starts off by exchanging his good bishop.} 19. Nxg5 Qxg5 20. h4 {?! Not spending enough time, I attacked Simon's Queen to gain tempo.  Not the best though because of Simon's next move. } Qe5 {As Simon is threatening 20...Qxb2.  But, best was 20...Bb7 to prevent what I'm about to do.  As this is where I am going to win material.  At best for black, a piece for pawn leaving me the equivalent to an entire piece up without anything in return.  This is also what I was alluding to when Simon played 17...f4  In other words, what I was also implying is that if Simon tried to prevent losing another pawn, I'd get an entire piece because I analyzed this entire line starting with the next move.} 21. Bf3 {As his N is now pinned.  And, I have a plan for when he breaks it which will also win a piece.} Bb7 {And, it starts with this move.  } 22. Na5 {As my N comes up, and what it shows is where the N's can be dangerous.  This is also something that I learned from TA which I used to teach Simon.  As I was visualizing where the N can go which is N visualization counts.  Of course the idea being is that his B is attacked.  So, if Simon tries to defend the N, I'll take the B.  That's only leaves black with the option of moving the B back, but then, I will win his N.  That is also what I kept in mind when 17...f4? was played.} Rad8 {So, Simon protects his N.  But, in this position, that's what I would've let go.  His B was more dangerous and posed more threats then his N.  Despite having an edge, this is where I feel that I now have a win.  It might take a while, but winning the material is gonna be too much for black to chew off.} 23. Nxb7 Rd7 {Doing what he can for counterplay, Simon attacks my N.} 24. Nc5 {Interested in what Simon will do, I attack his R.} Re7 {?? This loses, yet, another piece.  Much better would've been 24...Rd6 to keep the N protected.  By playing this move, I will get his N.  It's an example of where one mistake often leads to another, but as noted, I wasn't going to say anything to Simon because of where we are.  Just an extra piece and pawn is a known win.} 25. Bxd5+ Kh8 {Of course, this was the only way to get out of check without losing more material right away.  But, I have a different plan.  Even if I don't win anything else, my idea is to liquidate.  It's known that you want to exchange pieces while ahead.  At the very least, I'm gonna force liquidation with my next move.} 26. Re1 Qc7 {Of course, 26...Qd6 was best, as then, I'd exchange.  But, I can hold off on that because of the upcoming fork which is going to win an additional R for N.  } 27. Ne6 {With that being said, even when I did not resign with ruinous loss of material, I would've done it here.} Qb8 28. Nxf8 Rd7 {A better try for black would've been 28...Rxe1+, as after 29.Qxe1, Simon has 29...Qxf8.} 29. Nxd7 Qd6 {Trying to win back a piece.} 30. Re8+ {But, keeping in mind what happened with fiercequeens last annotation, combined with, Simon's back rank being weak, I played this.  As now, mate is unavoidable.  The only move is 30...Qf8, and that's, of course, followed by 31.Rxf8#  Seeing the sequence, black resigned.  When the game was over, I summed it up for Simon.  Of course, when I gave the lecture I wasn't alluding to when he first developed the f pawn, but rather, when he advanced it with 17...f4.  So, I said, You played better then you thought. The first mistake was an oversight which lost a pawn. But, where you went wrong was advancing the f pawn. As noted, that kept the structures weak. Surely, I didn't win a pawn immediately, but I initiated an exchange. As then, I could pin your N with my B, with which other things were to come. From that point, I activated my N, with which, I was going to win a piece. That's because I either was going to take one of them right away, or force it to move, with which, I'd get the other piece. From then on, there wasn't much else but some oversights with which I won more material, and had a mate. The important moral to this game is not to advance the f pawn early. That's the weakest pawn on the board. Once that's gone, then you wind up in trouble or have to be very careful as the King starts to become exposed. And, you want to be weary of the N because, even though B's are certainly worth more, once you get a lot of mobility with your Knight, it can become very dangerous, as TA showed in the N visualization count.  And, I showed him the link to that lecture to help for the future.}
