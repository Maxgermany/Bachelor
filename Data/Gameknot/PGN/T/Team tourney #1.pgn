1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. c4 {I thought this was a bit unusual, d4 is I think better so it's 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4} Nc6 4. Be2 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. d3 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. Bg5 a6 9. Qd2 Bg4 10. Bh6 {Not sure this was good, if I'd taken your bishop I think that would have been good but there was no reason for me to do that as it would let your queen in. So I just ignored it.} Bxf3 {Here I wanted to decrease your control of the center so I could plant my knight in a better spot and I felt removing your knight weakened the defence of your king a bit. Also was hoping to take your bishop with my knight later and force you to take with the g pawn further weakening the king's position.} 11. Bxf3 Ne5 12. Be2 {I thought this was a good move} Qc7 {The plan with this was to win your h pawn by moving the d pawn forward and then knight to g4 trying to exploit the fact that you no longer had a knight protecting that pawn} 13. Bg5 Rab8 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. Nd5 {Good move, very annoying to have your knight there. I had to move the queen but didn't want to have my bishop lost and worse make me recapture with the e pawn meaning I had a backward d pawn and no piece to protect my king.} Qd8 16. Qh6 {Was really surprised by this move. I think 16. Nxf6 exf6 would have been better and then you could follow up with 17. Qh6 but leaving the bishop there makes it very easy for me to drive the queen out.  To me this was a pivotal move in the game. If you'd taken the bishop I would have felt that I was losing. I realize your knight had a great position but e6 would easily drive it away so saddling me with double pawns and allowing your queen to stay near my queen would have been scarier.} Bg7 17. Qe3 e6 18. Nf4 Nc6 19. h3 {Not sure why you did this. I was planning on advancing through the center so something like Bf3 would have been better to try and stop my d5.  Also you missed the immediate threat here which was to win the b pawn and attack your rook} Bxb2 {From this moment I felt I was winning as I was ahead in material and felt I had a good position on the queen side to attack.} 20. Rab1 Bg7 21. Bg4 Qe7 {I was worried you'd sacrifice the knight to attack the king and felt that would have been defensible but didn't want to take any chances. Really wanted to lock the game down and ensure all my defences were covered.} 22. Bf3 Bh6 {Hoping to win the pinned knight with e5 I was planning on busting the center with d5 but since your bishop is on f3 I couldn't do that but winning the knight seemed possible. } 23. e5 {Seemed to clearly lose a piece but not sure what was a better move to avoid losing the knight. Maybe you were hoping for counter play with the queen but considering I had connected rooks on my back rank with the queen on the 7th rank I felt I was very secure.  A possible alternative might have been: 23. Nxg6 hxg6 24. Qxh6 which would leave you up a pawn.} dxe5 24. Bxc6 exf4 25. Qf3 bxc6 26. Rxb8 {I wasn't unhappy you did this as I was up in material and wanted to trade down.} Rxb8 27. Qxc6 Qb7 {Again trying to trade material.} 28. Qxc5 f3 29. g3 Qd7 {Trying for e5 followed by Qxh3} 30. Rd1 {}
