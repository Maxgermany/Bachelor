1. d4 {3 days per move. Rated game. } Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 d6 4. Nc3 g6 {You see, now I have some power in the center, but later in the game my opponent would control th a1-h8 diagonal. That's prety expected. What I like to do in such positions is to bring activity in the center as soon as posible. Perhaps block the diagonal by placing a pawn on e5. That explains my next move. } 5. e4 Bg7 6. f4 {This is needed for my plan to play e5 later. } O-O 7. Bd3 {You see, now we have equal number of figures developed. I still don't have a good opportunity to play e5. If so, there would have been played 7... dxe 8. fxe Ng4 and I couldn't defend my pawn. Another reason to play Bd3 is that it's an obvios place for the bishop to stay. I better wait before playing Nf3. That way my opponent wouldn't play Bg4 and maybe exchange his bishop. So there appears to be problem its development. If placed on d7, the Knight from would have a hard time reaching the center. If the Knight goes on d7, the bishop would have nowhere to move. Also, If 7... Bg4 8. Qc2 and now Kbd7 is bad because the bishop dies after h3 and g4. } Na6 {Kinda resolves the problem explained before. But still, that Knight is inactive. It couldn't be exchaned for my bishop on d3 cause I could place it on b1 if needed. } 8. Nf3 {I believe better than moving my bishop from c1. It would have a chance to be placed anywhere on the c1-h6 diagonal after e5, dxe5 and fxe5 at some time. So I don't want to lose tempo by playing it on d2 or e3. } Nc7 9. O-O a6 {I saw that plan for doing something on b5, but I still don't find it scary } 10. Re1 {The last step before e5. Now it couldn't be stoped. } Bd7 11. e5 {e5 comes before b5. } Nfe8 {Didn't expected it. Maybe he hopes that I play 12. exd Nxd6. Then his knight would be placed in way that it couldn't be attacked by pawn and thats great. But I wouldn't take there cause I see that and also want my pawn on e5. } 12. Rb1 {This move is kinda hard to explain. First, I procrastinate developing my bishop from c1. Second, I relieve the presure from a1-h8 diagonal. For example, if b3 or b4 is played, I'll have one pice less to remove from that diagonal before taking something with my e5 pawn. } b5 {If I take here just now, I'm afraid that I'll have hard time defending my d5 pawn later. Also, my opponents c pawn would most surely become a passed one. And last, but not less important, that might lead to exchanging pieces and I don't want that. Just because my opponents pieces aren't placed well enough and I hope he'll have a hard time coordinating them. } 13. b4 {Here I want to take on c5 and after dxc to play for my d pawn becoming a pssed one. My opponent's c pawn would also become such one, but it would be isolated too. } bxc4 14. Bxc4 cxb4 15. Rxb4 Bb5 16. Nxb5 {I want to keep my white bishop and as a whole - myself from exchanges. If I had taken 16. Bxb5 Nxb5 and I would have to think how not to exchange my knight too. It looks like I win a pawn here, but after all there would be Rxa2 so I don't. } axb5 17. Bb3 {That I find to be the best move in the game. As I said before, the knight on e8 isn't placed good. By playing Bb3 I prevent exchange and the c7 knight from moving (If Ka6, I would take on b5) and that way also preventing e8 from moving on c7 in just a few moves. Thats a big problem for the black cause it means that his rook on f8 would remain inactive. At the same time, I might move mine from b4 to the center. Also I have a easy plan for playing Nd4 with tempo and then Nc6. } Qd7 {That removes the tempo from the Nd4 move. Also Na6 is a treat leading to development with tempo. } 18. Qd3 {The right response. Prevents Na6 cause then there would be Qxb5 and me having a pawn more. Also N d4 happens to be a move with a treat again. } Ra5 {Still trying to play Na6. } 19. Nd4 {Still preventing that in a way. } dxe5 {Seems like now my pawn on d5 is under threat and I would be left with one less. However, I have a previously thought move. } 20. Nc6 {I keep my pawn on d5 and at the same time attack a rook. } Ra6 {Better was Ra8. Even then, I would just play Qf3 and have a great position. Here the treat is Rxc6. } 21. Nb8 {I guess he didn't see that coming. } Qd6 22. Nxa6 Nxa6 23. Rxb5 exf4 {He tries to take pawns for compensation of the loss, instead of developing the Knight from e8. } 24. Qe4 {Double attack. } Bf6 25. Bxf4 Qd7 {Now I'm fully developed Nc5 is not a threat. } 26. Ra5 Nec7 27. Ba4 {Important move. That would make his queen inactive. Also harder for the rook on f8 to join the game. My plan includes playng Rc1 and placing presure on the knights on a6 and c7. I'll can play Qc4 too and during that the black's bishop and rook won't join the defence. } Qxd5 {Blunder. However, nice game. } 28. Rxd5 {}
