[Opening "Sicilian (B97), Najdorf, Poisoned pawn variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The game goes into the Sicilian Najdorf variation } 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 {All regular moves in the position - Rybka looks towards kingside activity with an early pawn push, whereas Shredder plays slow, but maintains a very solid position. Here, e5 is threatened, as it wins the pinned knight } Qb6 {Shredder breaks the pin and targets the b2 pawn... } 8. Qd2 {!? This is known as the poisoned pawn variation, and is something that I've never experienced myself. Rybka is prepared to gambit a pawn in return for tempo attacks on Black's queen and a lead in development } Qxb2 {Personally, I wouldn't do this, [8...Nc6] but it has to be playable. Shredder grabs at the opportunity to gain a material advantage. } 9. Rb1 {The logical follow-up - Rybka chases away the enemy queen } Qa3 {Forced } 10. e5 {Rybka plays aggressively - of course, the knight can escape safely without the pin... but this doesn't seem too beneficial for Rybka at first... } dxe5 11. fxe5 Nfd7 {here's why - after Shredder exchanges pawns, Rybka is straddled with an isolated pawn on e5, and now if she wants to preserve her pawn she has to defend it with a piece. Either the dark square bishop or the queen can do this job just fine, but since the two pieces have already moved it seems a bit awkward. Had I not known the game continuation, I would have marked 10.e5 as ?! [dubious]... } 12. Ne4 {However, it turns out that Rybka has something completely different in that small little chip that is her mind! She centralises her knight while leaving TWO pawns hanging - the pawn on e5 and the freshly undefended pawn on a2. In fact, you've probably noticed by now but Shredder can win both of these pawns! } h6 {zwischenzug first - Shredder deems it prudent to attack the bishop first [interestingly enough, this gives Rybka another chance to defend her e5 pawn with Bf4...] } 13. Bh4 {Rybka's still willing to let that pawn go, however. } Qxa2 {As well as nabbing the a2 pawn. Shredder also gains a 'tempo' attack on the rook...  } 14. Rd1 {...in other words, Shredder forces Rybka to centralise her rook - oh, the torturous horror of it all! How dare that Shredder should do such a thing! [I'd like to explain for the benefit of the two machines in this game that my last comment was filled with sarcasm :P] } Qd5 {Shredder doesn't grab the pawn straight away, and instead centralises his queen. With two pieces attacking the e5 pawn, none defending and no pawn to defend it, there's no rush to grab it just yet... } 15. Qe3 {It's mildly surprising that Rybka chose this move over moving her bishop, but after a bit of further analysis, I realise that it was to make Shredder take the pawn with the queen. If, now, 15...Nxe5?! 16.Nf6+! gxf6 17.Bxf6+ Rg8 18.Bxe5 and the open position favours Rybka's developed position. Perhaps Shredder could have also tried 15...Nc6 but that, too, may be dubious; 16.Nb3 Qxe5 with a lot more tempo attacks on the queen to come [only unlike in the continuation, Shredder can't play Qa5+ - the queen is stuck on the kingside, which would lead Rybka with plenty of tactical tricks - e.g. 17.Bg3 Qf5 18.Nd6+ Bxd6 19.Bxd6] } Qxe5 {At any rate, now Shredder is three pawns up (the equivalent of a piece) - is Rybka really the masterful chess engine that everyone consider her to be? Yes - yes she is! Readers have probably noticed by now that Shredder's pawn grabbing has left him severely lagging in development (especially on the queenside). This means that Rybka needs to act fast if she wants to take advantage of it. Also, look at the centre control from Rybka's two knights! [you know, being three pawns down can also happen to White in the Evans Gambit if his opponent goes pawn hunting. Most of the time, Black gets punished heavily for that :)] } 16. Be2 {All Rybka needs to do now is castle and she's essentially completed development; Shredder will need at least five moves to finish his, not including the a8 rook [dark square bishop move, castling, b7 pawn move, light square bishop move, b8 knight move] } Bc5 {This would be logical in normal circumstances, as the knight on d4 is now under increased pressure, but I was confused as to why Bb4+ wasn't played here - it prevents Rybka from castling! as the e4 knight is pinned, it can't block the check and c3 is a waste of time for the same reason. Evidently Shredder must have calculated that getting rid of Rybka's central control was more important than preventing her from castling... } 17. Bg3 {This is a mark of how much control Rybka actually has right now - the queen has no flight squares! That is easily remedied by Shredder's next (forced) move... } Bxd4 {... but still even now, there is only two squares for the black queen to go - the f5 square and the a5 square } 18. Rxd4 {Reviewing the board now, you can really see how lively Rybka's game is, despite the three point material defect. Both bishops cover good diagonals and she has a centralised queen and knight. Shredder, on the other hand, has only one queen and a slightly passive knight in play. There is definitely compensation for the three pawn loss :) } Qa5+ {Shredder chooses the more aggressive of the two queen moves... [actually, the better of the two moves! 18...Qf5 19.Bd6!, and while Rybka can play Nf2 to allow castling again, it will be very hard to do that with for Shredder!]} 19. Rd2 {The only reasonable move to allow White castling prospects [Qd2??, allowing the exchange of queens is not what Rybka wants if she wants a fast attack]. Shredder could probably try for a draw here with 19...Qa1+ 20.Rd1 Qa5+ etc, but he has no reason to believe that he is losing right now [after all, he is three points up!] } O-O {Shredder castles. Rybka will do the same, but first... } 20. Bd6 {! Sometimes, an outpost can be just as good for a bishop than it is for the knight! } Re8 {Of course, the rook has to move... } 21. O-O {The pressure point that Rybka will aim for now is f7, and her next move will most likely be Qf4. Attempting to defend it would be futile, as only a knight on e4 can do that; 21...Nc6 22.Qf4 Nce5 23.Bh5! g6 24.Nf6+ Nxf6 25.Qxf6 with Bxe5 next move. [24...Kh8, hoping to give back material, works out similary after 25.Nxd7!, the main idea being to get rid of the defence on f7]. It seems as if Shredder has no choice but to move his pawn to neutralise the threat.. } f5 {21...f6 is of course the other alternative, but in that line Rybka is able to win back some of her material; 21...f6 22.Bh5 Rd8 23.Be7 Nc6 24.Bxd8 Nxd8 [though this is preferable to what happened in the game]. Perhaps 22.Qg3 would have also been considered in that line, choosing pressure over material. With this move, Shredder hopes to get aggressive himself. With the tempo attack that he gains on the knight, he has time to defend against the Bh5 threat (for example, g6). It does seem weakening on his position, but it doesn't look like Rybka can take advantage of that just yet...  } 22. Qg3 {!! ...though we have to remember that this is one of the world's strongest chess machine that you're talking about! Sacrificing a piece while three points down is unthinkable to most players, but bearing in mind that three of Shredder's pieces are currently out of action, so it isn't that unreasonable, actually.  } fxe4 {Was there anything better? I'm not saying that Shredder shouldn't take the knight, because Rybka can get a strong attack going either way; 22...Nc6 23.Qg6 Rd8 24.Qxe6+ Kh8 25.Rd6, and after the queen moves; 26.Rdxf5 definitely leaves Rybka in a better position. [in case you're wondering, 26...Nd4 is countered by 27.Qe7!]. In any case, Shredder has accepted the sac and the idea behind it becomes clear very quickly... [but what if the queen move to b6 with check? would a knight block be ok? If anyone finds better variations than the one I described, feel free to comment :)] } 23. Qg6 {First of all, Rybka repositions her queen with tempo. If Shredder were to try and exchange rooks here with Qxd2, it would lose quickly; 23...Qxd2 24.Qxe8+ Kh2 25.Bh5! [the threat is Bg6 mate] Ne5 26.Rf8 with Rg8# next move. } Rd8 {Pretty much forced } 24. Rf7 {Bringing a second attacker on g7, and there is only one way for Shredder to defend against this... } Qc3 {Which is why the en prise rook on d2 is still immune! } 25. Bg4 {Rybka keeps up the pressure! Now she threatens Bxe5, which will in turn threaten a discovered attack on the king. With so many pieces surrounding the king, mate would be inevitable [Rybka can even bring in rook #2 to join in the attack! 25...Nc6 26.Bxe6 Kh1 27.Rdf2! Shredder can only do one thing to defend against that...] } Nf8 {The knight move is forced, as it discoers two defenders on the e6 pawn. With the attack Shredder gains on the queen, he forces Rybka to capture the knight... } 26. Bxf8 {Now Rybka has three attackers on g7, which means that once again, the d2 rook is immune. Shredder isn't looking too good right now, because Rybka counters with Rxf8 with Rf2! and Rybka seems to win in all the variations that follow. What can Shredder do? } Qa1+ {Seems to me like this is the only resource available for Shredder. He is willing to give back material to halt Rybka's attack } 27. Rf1 {Kf2 allows counterplay after Rxd2+ [and perhaps even a draw or mate!] } Qxf1+ {The point of Qa1+ - Shredder sacs his queen for a rook and bishop to ease the pressure on his position } 28. Kxf1 Rxf8+ 29. Rf2 {This rook manoeuvre turns out to be pivotal in Rybka's game...   } Nc6 {Finally, with some room to breathe, Shredder attempts to get his queenside pieces into action at last... } 30. Bh5 {! But Rybka is far from done with him! The threat is 31.Rxf8+ Kxf8 then mate on either f7 or e8. Shredder could try 30...Bd7, but then comes 31.Rf7! Rxf7 32.Qxf7+ Kh8 33.Qxd7, leaving Rybka with a winning advantage. } Rxf2+ {Instead, Shredder trades off, but there's no way he can avoid losing a piece - can you see how? } 31. Kxf2 Ne5 {Shredder drives away the queen and covers the g6 square [Rybka's new threat was 32.Qe8+ Kh7 Bg6#] } 32. Qe8+ Kh7 33. Ke3 {! Now do you see how Black loses his piece? The moves from now until move 36 are all forced... and Rybka must have analysed all this back at move 22. That means that Rybka managed to see 14 moves ahead, including all the variations possible. Only a computer or a strong grandmaster can do this in real-time chess [though in correspondence chess like on Gameknot, it may be possible that players like Ion and Freddy can do so as well]  } b5 {The bishop can't move to d7, so Shredder opts to move it to b7. } 34. Kf4 {! As the knight is still preventing Bg6#, it cannot move, and there are no pieces which can defend it in time! [note that 34.Kxe4?? is calamity for Rybka after 34...Bb7+!, and Rybka loses her queen } Bb7 {Now Rybka's queen is forced off the h5-e8 diagonal, and the mating threat vanishes, but it's too late to avoid losing material... } 35. Qe7 {! Both the bishop and knight are threatened - Shredder can't save 'em both! } Bd5 {Shredder chooses to preserve the stronger of his two pieces, while defending the two e-pawns that are soom to be attacked by Rybka's king... } 36. Kxe5 {From now on, it's simple clean-up work for Rybka - she simply has a much better position! Her king is centralised, whereas Shredder's is trapped in a corner, and she has a well placed queen and bishop. Of course, there may be ample opportunities for her to go wrong, and Shredder now relies wholly on his passed pawns from now until the game's end, but Rybka's a computer - she knows what she's doing :) } a5 {Currently Shredder has three passed pawns on a5, e4 and e6 but the big problem for him is that the pawns are going to be tasty targets for Rybka's queen. } 37. g4 e3 {I was confused at first as to why Shredder didn't try using his rook to collect pawns, but the nature of Black's king means that Shredder's rook is confined to the back rank, and cannot go pawn hunting [a back row weakness this late in the game - unbelievable, isn't it?] Should the rook ever try to come off the back rank (for example, Rc8) then Rybka plays Qf7, and then Rxc2?? runs into Bg6+, then Qf8#. In short, Shredder can't do anything except pray for a miracle (and he can't even do that! He's a computer! :P) } 38. g5 hxg5 {This move is interesting - Either Shredder was worried about 39.g6 or 39.gxh6 Kxh6 40.Qf7. Though both moves do put increased pressure on his position, I can't find any mating nets that Rybka could exploit. As it turns out, this move actually loses a pawn - the pawn on e3, to be exact! } 39. Qxg5 Kg8 {His situation is bleak, but I feel that Shredder should at least try to push his passed pawns - it's the only thing going for him! } 40. Qxe3 Rf8 41. Be2 {Attacks the b5 pawn... } b4 {so Shredder advances it } 42. Bd3 Rf3 {Well, there's no real harm in trying, is there? Of course, Rybka needs to move her queen... but take note of where the queen moves... ;) } 43. Qg5 b3 44. Bg6 {! A great move that solidifies Rybka's advantage even more! Shredder's next moves are forced (I'm surprised he hasn't resigned here yet...) } Rf6 45. Qh5 {Threatens a mate in 3 - 46.Qh7+ Kf8 47.Qh8+ Ke7 48.Qe7#. The fact that such tricks like these are still available for Rybka at this late stage in the game is amazing!  } Rxg6 {Unfortunately this is the only move that prevents the mate } 46. Qxg6 b2 {Just... one...more... can the pawn make it? Not a chance! } 47. Qe8+ {Simply advancing the c-pawn will also prevent promotion, but then Shredder plays a4, then a3. In this line, Rybka denies Shredder of that form of counterplay... } Kh7 48. Qb5 {... and opts to simply take the b2 pawn off the board! } Kh6 49. Qxb2 Ba8 50. Qc1+ Kh5 51. Qf4 Bd5 {Shredder is completely helpless! } 52. c4 Bc6 53. Qf7+ Kg4 {I'm not going to mark this as a blunder, because Shredder is dead lost anyway....  } 54. Qxe6+ Kf3 55. Qxc6+ Ke3 {It is here that Shredder finally resigns. A phenomenal game from a top-class machine - I'd have never thought it possible for it to be this exciting! I hope readers of this annotation enjoyed this game as much as I did! Until next time - Alex [because I've never ended like this before ;)] }
