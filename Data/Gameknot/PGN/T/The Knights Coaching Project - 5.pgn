[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 {I won this game against a superior opponent.  He made one fatal blunder which cost him his queen. Moves one through six are thematic involving a Queen sacrifice to put pressure on blacks king} c5 {I love the Sicilian as black and play it often.} 2. f4 {This is known as the "grand prix attack".  I usually dont play this move as it weakens whites kingside but it offers some surprises as you will see.} d5 {I prefer Nc6 because I dont like to bring the queen out early and expose it to attack.} 3. Nf3 {White gambits the e4 pawn to get fast development to blacks kingside.} dxe4 4. Ng5 {if h6 the knight takes back the pawn with a centralized knight} Nf6 {defending the e4 pawn and developing a piece} 5. Bc4 {Now white develops his bishop to a good diagonal and threatens with a knight fork} Bg4 {black counterattacks by trapping the Queen but white is not worried here} 6. Qxg4 {The queen sacrifice here.  White will be down three points but has a superior position.} Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ {White foregoes the fork to put pressure on the black king.  The king has one forced move and cannot castle} Kd7 8. Be6+ {White wants to catch up on material while forcing blacks king to move hampering his development.} Kc6 9. Bxg4 Qd5 {Black blunders here by placing his Queen on the same diagonal with his king.  I still have my light squared bishop.} 10. Ne6 {I move my knight here in a better position.  I can take out his bishop since bishops are worth more than knights in a semi open game.} e3 {Blacks ultimate blunder here.  Now I have his Queen!} 11. Bf3 exd2+ {black tries to do some additional damage here but to no avail.} 12. Bxd2 Qxf3 {Black takes out my light squared bishop his best trade here.} 13. gxf3 {Now im ahead a minor piece but have doubled pawns on the kingside.} Kd6 {Black is going after my knight here and i gladly take the bishop} 14. Nxf8 Rxf8 15. Nc3 {Developing my knight for queenside castling.  Aiming my knight for b5} Nc6 {black develops his knight here} 16. O-O-O Nd4 {black attacks my undefended double pawn at f3 while protecting b5 at the same time.} 17. Rhf1 {Now i cant develop this rook on an open file.} Rf7 {I thought g5 was better here} 18. Ne4+ Kc6 19. Be3 {Im putting double pressure on his centralized knight now.} Ne2+ {a move i overlooked he now wins the f4 pawn} 20. Kb1 Nxf4 21. Nxc5 {When he grabbed that pawn he over looked my knight move here.  Now my rook is on an open file.} Nd5 {black is trying to fork my rooks here but to no avail} 22. Bg1 {I moved my bishop here to protect my knight and cover the e3 forking square.} Raf8 {double stacking the rooks is not a good idea here as you will see on the next move.} 23. Ne6 Re8 24. c4 Nc7 25. Nxc7 Kxc7 26. Bxa7 {Wearing him down while winning his a pawn.} b6 {He's going to try and trap my bishop here but to no avail as you will see on the next move.} 27. c5 bxc5 28. Bxc5 e6 29. b4 {Now im looking to promote my pawns here on the queenside} Kc6 30. Kb2 {Now ill get my king into the action} Rb8 31. Rd6+ {Now im smelling a possible mating attack} Kc7 32. Rxe6 {just wearing him down and hope to exchange rooks} Rf5 33. Re7+ Kc6 34. Kc3 Rg5 35. a4 Rg2 36. h4 {I wasted time here and should have concentrated on his king} Rg3 37. Kc4 {The king has done his job here cutting off the d5 and b5 squares mate in two.} Rh3 38. b5+ {Rxb5 axb5 mate.}
