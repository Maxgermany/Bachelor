[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence, Nyholm attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {The Ruy Lopez in a much more standard defensive configuration than Bird's Defence. But Bird handles things with aplomb.} 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Nxd4 {The game has become very open. Bird is now preparing to Castle, after which he will attempt to mount an attack.} Be7 7. O-O Nxd4 8. Qxd4 {With only 2 pieces in play, Bird now mounts a spectacular attack with the aid of a couple of Pawns. You'd think it would be defensible, but he makes it work!} Nc5 9. f4 b6 10. f5 Nb3 11. Qe4 {Bird is too alert to fall into 11 P(either one)xN??? B-B4! winning the Q.} Nxa1 {Steinitz pounces on the Rook, but he leaves his King defenseless and his position undeveloped.} 12. f6 {Forcing the Bishop to move away from the King file.} Bc5+ {Delaying Bird one move.} 13. Kh1 {A very safe haven. Steinitz's King, by contrast, is in grave danger.} Rb8 {A useless move. Steinitz should have at least taken the chance to Castle. It probably wouldn't have helped much but he could drag out his resistance some.} 14. e6 {Forcing the action. If Steinitz tries 14... BPxP, Bird has 15 QxKP ch K-B1 16 PxP ch KxP 17 B-R6 mate!} Rg8 {14... O-O may have been marginally better, but the position is hopeless in any case.} 15. Qxh7 {Bird misses the spectacular finishing line 15 PxQP dbl ch K-B1 16 Q-K8 ch QxQ 17 PxQ (Q) mate! However, he hunts down Steinitz's King quickly enough.} Rf8 {Forced, else 16 QxR is decisive.} 16. exf7+ {Opening the King file to deadly effect.} Rxf7 {16... KxP is equally bad [17 PxP dis ch.]} 17. Re1+ {Aiming down the mighty open file.} Be7 {Delays mate by one move.} 18. Qg8+ {The final blow.} Rf8 {Forced.} 19. f7# {Finis. Bird tied Steinitz's position into knots.}
