[White "Stockfish (3000)"]
[Black "Shredder (2100)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B24), closed"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {This is a kind of closed variation of Sicilian defense where white don't decide to open up immediately but instead try to develop pieces first before launching an attack. It can be hard for white to advance since it involves a very deep thought against black.} Nc6 3. g3 d6 4. Bg2 e5 5. Nge2 {We can see that knights are placed in the center especially the e2. Nc3 is responsible for attacking the d5 square and at the same time protecting e4 pawn. } g6 {The black tends to shadow the position at least make a fianchetto like white bishop. Probably the idea here is moving bishop to g7.} 6. d3 {Castling can be happen but d3 has been played by Stockfish maybe because it decides to open the bishop on c1 and it can be very useful though. If knight moves to f6 then white can reply with Bg5 to make an exchange. } Bg7 {Initial move for black to make an attack as it attempts to take control the center but so far bishop on g7 isn't showing any danger.} 7. O-O {Pretty position for white and flexible to destroy center pawns. Knight on c3 is like aggressive to control d5-square. } Nge7 {It can be necessary for black to move Nge7 as it is much safer than Nf6 even though the Queen and bishop can protect knight if the white will play bishop to g5.} 8. Nd5 Nxd5 {Black don't castle first just capturing knight, a very simple reply.} 9. exd5 Ne7 10. a3 {The idea here is to move pawn to b4 soon provoking c5 but didn't happened in this game.} O-O {Players hopefully will like black because it is already competent.} 11. Re1 {Stockfish tried to make a defense here as soon as knight will go away.} Bg4 {Bishop is not trying to capture the knight but it allows white pawn to advance then bring back the bishop to find some support from the Queen since h3-pawn serves as a main target. } 12. h3 Bd7 13. a4 {Pawn to a4 just to make counter attack if black desires to play pawn to b5. If pawn to b5 then white can capture immediately, giving the rook a solid rank to advance. } Qc8 14. Kh2 Qd8 {The queen here tries to attack b2 by playing Qb6.} 15. Bd2 Nf5 16. Nc3 {Replacing the previous c3 knight taking control the d5-square again.} Qb6 17. Ne4 {Knight lands in the super square and can do maximum commands. } Qxb2 {It's not necessary for black to capture the pawn.} 18. Rb1 {The queen is in danger now.} Qd4 19. a5 {The move is so deep very hard to find the idea.} Rab8 {Rook to b8. Shredder wants to protect b7-pawn.} 20. c4 {It looks like a trap for black that queen can't escape with.} Qxd3 21. Bf1 {Very good move by white.} Qd4 22. Qc2 {Queen to c2- the idea is not allowing black to get some material advantage and white can capture the queen soon. } Nxg3 {Sorry, this move seems so sad :-(} 23. fxg3 f5 24. Bc3 Qxe4 25. Rxe4 fxe4 26. Qc1 {Not to capture e4-pawn because black can play Bf5. } Rf2+ 27. Bg2 {Best cover to shield the king. Bishop is also protecting f1-square.} b5 28. axb6 e.p. {White can capture b5 using a5-pawn a legal move called "en passant". Just move a5 to b6 then white captures a pawn.} Rxb6 29. Ra1 {Ra1 is attacking a7.} Rb7 30. g4 Re2 31. Kg3 h5 {This is trying to attack the king.} 32. Ra6 {Ra6 to capture d6-pawn and white will always wanted to gain material advantage. But black can still defend.} h4+ {A very tricky move played by Shredder. } 33. Kh2 {The king is moving back to its safer place until the end of the game. The h1 is also safe for king. } e3 34. Rxd6 Kh7 {The king protects the pawn.} 35. Qd1 Rxg2+ {So sad :-(} 36. Kxg2 Bf8 {To force the rook moving in different direction.} 37. Ra6 Bh6 38. Qa1 {The queen wants to support attacking a7.} Bc8 39. Rxa7 e2 40. Rxb7+ Bxb7 41. Qa7 {Obviously white looks so very powerful.} Kg8 42. Qb8+ {Check the king then capture the bishop afterwards.} Kf7 43. Qxb7+ Kf6 44. Qd7 Bg5 45. Ba5 {Intention of this move leads to checkmate.} e1=N+ {Just try to check the king.} 46. Kh1 Nd3 47. Bd8# {Checkmate.}
