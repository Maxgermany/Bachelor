1. d4 {I have a hard opponent in this game and I learned well his play before I moved 1. d4} d5 {I expected exactly 1. ... d5 and Slav defence} 2. c4 c6 {you see} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 g6 {and we are in to the game. Here I expected 4. ... e6 instead of g6 and probably e6 would have been a better move.} 5. cxd5 {I choose that way} cxd5 6. Qb3 {6. Qd3 is not bad here I guess} Bg7 {black follow their plan} 7. Bf4 {7.Bf4 is also not bad here} a6 8. e3 O-O 9. h3 {and we have a standard position. 9. h3 allows safe retreat for the black bishop (f4)} Nc6 {all black moves are predictable now} 10. Bd3 Re8 11. O-O Na5 12. Qc2 {theory ...} b5 {and blacks are in attack} 13. b3 {13. b3! - now c4 is secured against the black knight} Bb7 14. Rac1 Rc8 15. Qd2 Nc6 {what else to do - back to the centre, back to the game} 16. Ne5 {exchange} Nxe5 17. Bxe5 e6 {17. ... e6 ?!} 18. Rfe1 {white are ready for the battle} Bf8 {and here we began} 19. Nxb5 {19. Nxd5 !! absolutely unexpected for the black} Rxc1 20. Rxc1 axb5 21. Bxb5 {and now is interesting} Nd7 22. Bxd7 Qxd7 23. Rc7 {black found the only way for defence} Qb5 24. Qc2 Ba6 25. Kh2 Bg7 26. Bxg7 Kxg7 27. a4 {here I (white) offered a draw} Qe2 {but black declined most probably expecting queens exchange and a complicated game} 28. Qc6 {but 28. Qc6!!} Rb8 {and mistake - first fatal mistake. It was better here 28. ... Qxf2 29. Qxa6 and a complicated position a bit better for the white.} 29. Rxf7+ {29. Rxf7!! for sure ! the other way was 29. Qxe6! also not bad I guess} Kxf7 30. Qc7+ Kf6 {and that was the second fatal mistake. It was better here 30. ... Ke8 or Kf8 but not Kf6 ??} 31. Qxb8 Bd3 {and the last mistake - no time for attack. Mate in 4 :)} 32. Qf8+ {32. Qf8+!!} Kg5 33. Qf4+ {33. Qf4+!} Kh5 34. g4+ Kh4 35. Qh6# {nice :)}
