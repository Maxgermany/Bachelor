1. c4 {strange game...} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. d3 Bb4 4. Bd2 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. a3 {considered as an inaccuracy by the computer.} Nxc3 7. Bxc3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 O-O 9. g3 Nc6 10. Bg2 Qf6 11. Qc2 {computer considers black as much better than white. Though, I like this kind of situation; white dominates the clear squares, threats to double c pawns and black has no specific threat. In 2 moves, I am completely developped.} Nd8 12. Nf3 c6 13. O-O {job's done} Ne6 14. Rab1 Nc5 15. Rb4 Bf5 {Now, white seems much better, according to the computer, but I finally saw a threat on d3... and panicked...} 16. Nd2 {computers proposed e4. I thought of it, but didn't believe in it. I already knew I would lose a pawn here} Rfd8 17. Nb3 Nxd3 18. exd3 Bxd3 {here comes rokk + 2 pawn for a bishop and a knight} 19. Qc1 Bxf1 20. Qxf1 {the idea to take back with the queen was already to point on the threat on c6 and prepare the queen to go on c4, whenever...} Qe7 {i am not sure the threat has been seen by black} 21. Na5 {here it comes.} Rd7 22. Nxc6 bxc6 23. Bxc6 {getting back the pawn... but I admit it is mostly due to black mistake on move 20.} Rc8 24. Bxd7 Qxd7 25. Rc4 {now I want to gain a move for my queen. I hoped for him to take} Rb8 26. Rb4 {here, if he takes, I reunite 2 pawns...} Rd8 {still doesn't want} 27. Qb5 {Now i try to gain an advantage for a3 and c3: if we exchange, I have considerable possibilities as my rook is much more mobile for a few move: his has to wait his king to get free from corridor mate.} Qd1+ 28. Kg2 e4 {strange mistake...} 29. Rxe4 {ok, I grap it. I have not seen any trap} g6 30. Re8+ Rxe8 31. Qxe8+ {Now my plan is much more simpler, as i can just act to exchange the queens. My king is not too far from c3.} Kg7 32. Qe5+ Kh6 {woops, this is bad! last huge mistake, the exchange is almost inevitable.} 33. Qf4+ Kg7 34. Qd4+ Qxd4 35. cxd4 {central pawn, king close... it is a classical final.} Kf6 36. Kf3 Ke6 37. Ke4 f5+ 38. Kd3 Kd5 39. f3 {to keep the king off e4} g5 40. h3 {computers considers this as an inaccuracy, and prefers g4.} h5 41. g4 hxg4 42. hxg4 fxg4 43. fxg4 a6 44. a4 a5 45. Ke3 Kc4 46. Ke4 {king passed... the rest is a formality} Kb4 47. d5 Kxa4 48. d6 Kb3 49. d7 a4 50. d8=Q a3 51. Qd3+ {computers proposes a mate in 5: instead of the move here: 51 Kd3 a2 52 Qb8+ Ka3  53 Kc4 threatening mate on b3 ... a1=N (if a1=Q, Qb3 mates) 54 Qb1 Nc2 (only move) 55 Qb3# cute mate.} Kb2 52. Qd1 {i disconsidered another forced mate in 5 here.} a2 53. Kf5 a1=Q 54. Qxa1+ Kxa1 55. Kxg5 {resigns... well, although I could have finished sooner, there was no doubt about the end for a long time. Strange game, because of the two  R+2p = B+N :-)}
