[Opening "QGD (D08), Albin counter-gambit, Lasker trap"]

1. d4 {My opponent had white pieces and game starts with d4.} d5 2. c4 {After d5, c4 we have queen's gambit.} e5 {e4, the signature move of Albin counter gambit.} 3. dxe5 {My opponent accepts the gambit pawn.} d4 {D4, gaining space on the board.} 4. e3 {White plays e3 which looks logical, hoping for dxe3 and then Bxe3 developing bishop by capturing the pawn, however this is an inaccuracy.} Bb4+ {Bb4+ I'm going for the famous trap line - The Lasker's trap.} 5. Bd2 dxe3 {After Bd2, dxe3 the trap has been set, but will my opponent take the bait? To take or not to take? That is the question.} 6. Bxb4 {White falls for it. The best move is actually fxe3, it may look ugly, but he would perhaps survive.} exf2+ {exf2+ King can not recapture because white would lose his queen.} 7. Ke2 {Ke2 is the only move.} fxg1=N+ {Fxg1=N+ under promoting to a knight with check. Promoting to any other piece would not work, because white has a in-between move Qxd8+, after Kxd8 white can then capture whichever piece the pawn promoted to with the rook. The best move in this position is actually Ke1 and black would follow with Qh4+. White is in deep trouble now, any inaccurate move would be devastating. Capturing the knight with rook would be a blunder...} 8. Rxg1 {White captures anyway...} Bg4+ {Bg4+ and he resigned. My opponent was not aware of this trap and cost him the game. }
