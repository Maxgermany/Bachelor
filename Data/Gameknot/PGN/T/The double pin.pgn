1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Bd7 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. O-O h6 {The opening moves give white a better position since white has already castled, while black needs 3 moves to castle, and white already has two minor pieces out in front of the pawns while black has only 1 minor piece on the front lines.} 6. e5 Ng4 {I expected black to reply with d6xe5.} 7. exd6 exd6 {The pawn exchange opens up the king line before the black king can castle.} 8. Re1+ Be7 {Be6 would have led to Bxe6 f7xe6 Rxe5+ with white ahead by a pawn and able to deploy both knights to support the rook. Be7 allows black to castle.} 9. Nd5 {White puts another threat on the pinned bishop.} Nc6 10. b3 {White plans to fianchetto the bishop and take out unprotected g7 pawn.} Nf6 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 {That pawn is still unprotected even after it captures the knight.} 12. Bb2 Ne5 {Black knight moves to unpin the bishop and protect the weak f7 pawn.} 13. Nxe5 {White removes the knight and threatens the f7 pawn. An alternative move was Bd4 so the black knight could not threaten it. Black might have replied with Nxf3+ followed by Qxf3 and thus line up the queen and bishop against the unprotected b7 pawn. Or black might have replied with Bc6 to defend the b7 pawn. If that happened, white would have exchanged bishops: Bxc6 b7xc6.} dxe5 14. Qh5 {White threatens mate on f7.} Rh7 {Best response for black.} 15. c3 {Looks like white is blocking his own bishop, but the real goal is to clear out black's center pawns for a devastating attack later. Notice how both of black's bishops are in front of the king and queen. Just keep watching the center of the board for the next few moves.} b5 16. Bd5 Rb8 17. d4 {Now white is ready to clean out the center of the board.} cxd4 18. cxd4 b4 19. dxe5 fxe5 20. Bxe5 {White has now cleared the center pawns away, is one point up in material, and is ready to unveil the long-term tactic he's been working towards since move 15.} Rb5 21. Bc4 {Pulling back one bishop to get ready for the real attack.} Rc5 22. Qf3 {Move queen out of danger.} Rc8 23. Rad1 {Now black's d7 bishop is pinned against the queen!} h5 24. Bf6 {And now black's e7 bishop is pinned against the king! With both bishops pinned, black has few options.} h4 25. Rxe7+ {One bishop gone!} Kf8 {Black either moves the king out of danger or recaptures with the queen. The result is to either accept the loss of a bishop or exchange the queen for a rook and bishop. } 26. Rdxd7 {Two bishops gone!} Qb6 27. Rexf7+ {White is now just forcing black to trade away any pieces usable for defense.} Rxf7 28. Rxf7+ Kg8 29. Rg7+ {Check again with the same rook. At this point, black will lose on the next move regardless of what he does.} Kh8 30. Qh5# {And it's over!}
