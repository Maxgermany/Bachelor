1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Now he thinks I am playing the Italian Opening.} Bc5 4. b4 {This is the move for the Evans Gambit. You give away this pawn for a chance to develop faster.} Bxb4 5. c3 {With this move he must move his Bishop a third time in 5 moves.} Ba5 {This is not the only place the Bishop can go. Black can put this Bishop on e7 to and that is a different line. And I can't write that much so all I will say is the the Bishop does not do good to go back to c5 because you play 6. d4 and he will have lots of trouble. } 6. O-O {I castle. But you can play d4 right away if you like. I just do not like pins and my coach says that castling is still a good move.} Nf6 {Black must race to develop. This move attacks my e4 pawn. But he must not take it. His King is still in the middle and I can attack his King through his Knight if it is on e4, and his pawn on e5. This would be bad for Black. } 7. d4 {Now I attack the center. There is no pin on the c3 pawn and the Knight on b1 is a good bodyguard for it.} d6 {d6 is not a good move He should take my pawn on d4. Now I can make him work real hard, because every time I take a pawn with my pawn he must decide what he can do about it. And now I can open the center for my pieces.} 8. dxe5 Nxe5 {Now he should take with his pawn. This makes trouble for Black because I can do anything I want with my Queen. I can trade Queens and his King will be stuck in the middle because the King is the only bodyguard for her. But I find a better place for my Queen. } 9. Nxe5 dxe5 10. Qb3 {You can only put your Queen on b3 if Black can not put a Knight on a5 or d4. This is another reason Nxe5 was not a good plan. My coach Mr. Marble says that the most important square to keep track of is f7 for Black and f2 for White at the beginning of a game and the Evans Gambit always attacks f7.} Qd7 {This is Blacks mistake. Black should castle and then White only has a little advantage. Now you will see why the Evans Gambit is mean.} 11. Rd1 {I give this two exclamation points because I thinked of it for a long time. And I want to take the King away from the Queen when she is on f7. The Rook has a body guard from my Queen on b3 and I do not give Black time to castle any more because I will take the Queen. I no he will put his Queen on f7 because of my plan. } Qe7 12. Bxf7+ {Black thinks I made a mistake and that I will lose my Bishop for the pawn. But I made a good plan and he did not see it.} Qxf7 13. Rd8+ {This is the reason from my plan! My coach calls this a decoy. If Black takes the Rook then he will leave the Queen and I can take it. If he goes to e7 then that will not work because I can play Ba3+ and he will have to take the Rook anyway.} Kxd8 14. Qxf7 {I win the Queen and now his pieces do not work good together.} Rg8 15. Bg5 {The Knight is the only thing keeping Black from losing the Rook. So set a pin so it can not move so I can take it on my next turn.} Re8 16. Qxg7 {A person said he thinks it is checkmate in 2 moves but Black can play many moves that make it not checkmate. I think Bd7 is probably best. But Black decided that it was to hard to win with this position and he resigned.  I hope you liked my game. Thank you Cenarius. You are a good player and you will win lots of games.}
