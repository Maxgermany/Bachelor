1. e4 {The ending of this game is pretty sweet.} c5 2. e5 Nc6 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd6 e.p. Qxd6 5. Bb5 Nf6 6. O-O a6 7. Bc4 b5 8. Be2 Bg4 9. a3 e5 10. d3 Nd4 11. Re1 Nxf3+ {Bold.  This exchange doesn't end with white breaking pawns, however.} 12. Bxf3 Bxf3 13. Qxf3 Rd8 14. Bf4 Nd7 15. Nc3 Be7 16. Nd5 {If you were thinking of castling, the Queen is already protecting the bishop.  But the bishop move does add more defense to Pe5. } Bf6 17. Re2 O-O 18. Nxf6+ Qxf6 19. Bg3 Rfe8 20. Qg4 a5 21. Bh4 Qf4 22. Qxf4 exf4 23. Bxd8 Rxe2 24. Bxa5 Rxc2 25. Re1 Rxb2 26. Bb6 {Ha ha!  White thinks you'll take the bait.  Re8# is an obvious game ender. } h6 {:)  Smart move.  Opening the back door.} 27. Bd8 Rb3 {Yes, now is a good time to molest pawns.} 28. f3 Rxd3 {Good choice.  The center pawns are more valuable than the side ones--a lesson I learned from your father. } 29. Re8+ Kh7 30. Re7 f6 31. Re4 c4 32. a4 b4 33. Rxc4 {Oh, white's bad.  That pawn isn't worth the bishop you could win with Ne5.} Ne5 34. Rc8 Ra3 35. a5 b3 36. Rb8 Nd3 {:)  The knight secretly guards the white king's only escape route.} 37. a6 {?  White is blind to the threat?} Ra1# {}
