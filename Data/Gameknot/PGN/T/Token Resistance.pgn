1. d4 {Hi everybody!  It was time for Round 5 with Master Freddy and guess what, I lost!  Yup, this furry white kitten has taken another cattermauling.  It is sooo maddening and frustrating.  This time I decided to kick off with a d4 opening and Freddy decided to go Dutch with f5.  I chose what I thought were the best moves from the World DB, i.e. those which would get me a decent piece placement and pawn centre in the middlegame.  Then Freddy took me out of the database with a queen move.  Then Freddy handed my position some hemlock with this queen move.  Later on in the game, after dropping a couple of pawns I tried to break free with a few spite checks and a mate threat but all to no avail - it was only token resistance.} f5 2. g3 d6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bg2 {4. Bg2 - pretty standard play against the Dutch - white usually fianchettoes his/her bishop along the h1 - a8 diagonal.  Some nasty pins can occur as a result of this bishop's occupation.  In fact a few moves later I try a double fianchetto, taking a leaf out of Coach Ion's book - remember in our last game he used a double fianchetto against me which proved decisive in his favour!  So why not use it on Master Freddy, eh?} g6 5. b3 Bg7 6. Bb2 {6. Bb2 - Voila!} O-O 7. O-O Qe8 8. c4 {8. c4 - and here comes the "decent" pawn centre!} Na6 9. Nbd2 e5 10. dxe5 Ng4 11. Ba3 {11. Ba3 - had a good win percentage in the db - it pins the d pawn from taking the e pawn so to avoid being a pawn down black has to recapture with the knight and now an exchange of knights occur on e5.  The downside of this exchange is that it brings out the Wicked Witch of the West onto a good square - she comes with a barreload of hemlock on her broomstick!} Nxe5 12. Nxe5 Qxe5 13. Rb1 Qa5 {13. ........... Qa5!! - this is when the Witch administers the poison.  My a pawn is hanging behind Fou Lenoir so, to avoid the loss of the pawn, Glenda, oh bless her, has to defend Fou Lenoir.  Now Fou Lenoir is unable to contest the a1 - h8 diagonal or else I will lose a pawn.} 14. Qc1 Nb4 15. Bxb4 Qxb4 {15. ........... Qxb4 - I deal with the dilemma of the skewer on Fou Lenoir, but the bishop pair is gonna work in black's favour here.} 16. Qc2 f4 17. Rbd1 Bf5 18. Be4 Bg4 {18. ............ Bg4 - hitting out at the e2 pawn so Fou Leblanc defends.} 19. Bf3 Bh3 20. Bg2 Bxg2 21. Kxg2 {21. Kxg2 - both lsbs have been exchanged but alas, black still keeps the pressure on.} Rae8 22. Qd3 Qa5 23. a4 Qh5 24. Qf3 fxg3 25. Qxh5 gxh5 26. hxg3 Rxe2 {26. ........... Rxe2 - after a forced queen swap (otherwise loss of Henry or Glenda) I now lose a pawn, worse Freddy now gives me a "bone in the throat" - another phrase for a rook on the 7th rank or my second.} 27. Kg1 Bh6 28. f4 h4 {28. ......... h4 - undermines support of f4 pawn and this will result in me dropping a second pawn.} 29. gxh4 Bxf4 30. Nf3 Be3+ 31. Kh1 Rf4 32. Rd3 {32. Rd3 - trying to place my rook in a more active position and defending my b pawn at the same time.  Henry is stuck in the corner - in fact he is actually stalemated - pity I can move my other pieces!} a6 33. Rd5 h6 34. Rd3 Bc5 35. Rb1 Kh7 36. Rd2 {36. Rd2 - I try and exchange off the pesky bone in the throat, but Freddy moves it up one square which is just as nasty.  My knight is doubly attacked and I am forced to place it into a pin and to drop another pawn.} Re3 37. Nh2 Rxh4 38. Rf1 Bd4 39. Rf7+ {39. Rf7  - here is the start of the token resistance - at least Freddy can have a miniscule taste of his own medicine here!} Kg6 40. Rxc7 {40. Rxc7 - temporarily reducing the deficit to 1 pawn, but alas, Freddy still has some really nasty tricks up his sleeve.} Be5 41. Rg2+ Kh5 42. Kg1 {42. Kg1 - moving the knight out of the pin but maybe I should have played Rf7 now rather than next move.  Freddy now helps himself to my b pawn.} Rxb3 43. Rf7 {43. Rf7 - threatens Rf5# but this threat is easily brushed off!} Bxh2+ 44. Rxh2 Rb1+ 45. Kg2 Rb2+ {45. ............ Rb2  - now I wave the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material because I will drop a rook.  When Henry moves out of the way my h2 rook will be doubly attacked and only once defended (by Henry).  If Rf2 blocking the check then Rxf2, Kxf2, Rxh2  and Freddy will be a whole rook up in a pawn ending.   Back to the drawing board for jstevens1.}
