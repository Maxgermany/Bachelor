1. e4 d6 {It is best to enter the Philidor with a Pirc move order, bypassing some very good lines for White.} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. f4 {The main line is 4.Nf3 allowing Black to transpose into the Philidor with 4...e5.  The game move is the most critical test of Black's move order.} e5 5. d5 {This move takes us (or at least me) out of the books.  The move grabs space, but takes a lot of pressure of e5 and Black's center.  Another drawback is that White falls behind in development, which can explode in White's face if he gets too aggressive and allows Black to detonate the center.} c6 {More or less my default move.  It opens the d8-a5 diagonal for the Queen, prepares ...b5, and directly attacks White's center.  } 6. Nf3 Be7 7. fxe5 {Since White is behind in development, I don't think this is a good idea.} Nxe5 {7...dxe5 is the alternative and equally good.} 8. Nxe5 dxe5 {White has one developed piece, the knight on c3 which blocks his c-pawn.} 9. Bc4 {There is no question this is bad, Black gets in the thematic ...b5 with tempo, allowing him to immediately follow up with ...b4 attacking White's center.   I think this is an example of the psychological aspect of the Philidor.  White perhaps feels that Black is playing a passive system and that he as all the time in the world to develop his attack against Black. } b5 10. Bd3 b4 {...b4 is a move that  has to be timed.  When you play ...b4 you do it to attack the center and need to have pressure against e4 in place.  No question that Black has the necessary prerequisites in place in this game.} 11. Ne2 cxd5 {White's center not only disappears, but Black wins a pawn in the process. } 12. exd5 Qxd5 {Black clearly has the advantage now.} 13. O-O {Fritz gives this move a ?, and recommends Ng3.   } O-O {? I miss  13...e4 which wins immediately.  } 14. Rxf6 {I also missed this move which allows White to equalize and perhaps more.} Bb7 {The rook cannot be taken because of Bxh7 ck with a discovered attack on the Queen, so I protect the queen and threaten mate.} 15. Rf2 Bc5 16. Qf1 Bxf2+ {Here Fritz recommends ...e4, and Black equalizes.   After the game move, material is even, I have a rook and a pawn vs. two minor pieces.  This normally favors the minor pieces.  During the game, I felt that I might be able to obtain the initiative and get my rook quickly in to play.} 17. Qxf2 Rad8 {I was feeling optimistic here.  I intended a rook lift to d6, thinking that the 6th rank was ideal for my rook.  Once again I overlook ...e4.} 18. Ng3 {Now its too late to play ...e4 as the Bishop can escape.  I finally realize that Black's minor pieces can control the 6th rank and its not such a wonderful rank for my rook.} Qd7 {Here Fritz recommends 18...f5 19. Bg5 Rde8 as better, although White would still have an edge.} 19. Bg5 {Better would be Be3.} f6 20. Rd1 {White would still have a large advantage after 20.Be3, but goes for a cheap trap instead.  White is going for a discovered attack on the queen after a bishop check.} Qg4 {Now it is Black with the large advantage.} 21. Bc4+ {?? game ends on a blunder.} Qxc4 {A very ragged game, with mistakes on both sides, but it did give me more confidence in the opening and was a good shakedown cruise.}
