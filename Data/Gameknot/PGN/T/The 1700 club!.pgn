1. e4 {Ethan's typically been rated in the high 1700s/low 1800s...} g6 {While tag's been between 1400 and 1550 for most of that time.  However, his rating topped 1700 for the first time recently, and was 1712 at the start of this game.  This is also the first time I've ever played 1. e4 against him and he *hasn't* responded 1... d5.  Interesting.} 2. d4 {If he's content to play on the flanks, I'm simply going to take over the center.} Bg7 3. c4 {And if I can grab an even bigger center, why not?  More space and more board control leads to more chances later in the game.} b6 {Playing for the double fianchetto?!  I'll take the great classical position any day.} 4. Nc3 Bb7 5. Be3 {So black's got his bishops in the towers like snipers.  His position is looking cramped, but with lots of counterattacking possibilities.  At this point, I start thinking about the Saemisch Variation of the King's Indian.  Black has the extra disadvantage of having played b6 and Bb7, so if I can shore my king away on the queenside, point my pieces at the kingside and eventually advance the g- and h-pawns, I'll have a great attack going!  I'm hoping he complies.} d6 {...and now I see the problem with fianchettoing both bishops!  Normally, whichever center pawn you advance first also opens a line for a bishop on its home square.  Having already spent 4 moves working on the bishops, this move lacks some of its usual punch.} 6. Bd3 {Continuing to control the center and point at the kingside.} Nd7 {Seems like it justifies d6, but this is still slow and passive.  Black will have a difficult time finding good squares for his pieces on a board like this.} 7. Nge2 {Nf3 was tempting, I'm not going to lie.  But Nge2 also allows for f3 followed by g4 down the road, which looks great for a kingside storm.  } Ngf6 {Of course.  Now, 0-0 is tempting (and probably recommended), but why do that?  Black's probably going to castle kingside and that's where my pieces are poised to go after him.  Why not just...} 8. f3 {Play f3.  It shores up e4, frees up the Nc3 and the Bd3 to move if necessary, and supports a future g4.} O-O {?!  I'm not saying it isn't defensible or reasonable, but with a view to what happens later, it's hard to say this move is very good.} 9. Qd2 {On the other hand, things are starting to look easy for white.  White's plan is clear: point your pieces at the black king, play 0-0-0, push the pawns up the g- and h-files, bust open the defenses, and checkmate that king.    Qd2 helps nicely, as the queen defends all the minor pieces, clears the way for 0-0-0, and forms a great battery along the c1-h6 diagonal.} Re8 {I start to think, now.  Black must see the kingside attack coming.  He must know the only hope is a counterattack, either on the queenside or in the center.  So I start thinking what I'll do if black plays e5 next, or possibly c5...} 10. O-O-O {And I conclude that this will be a good move no matter what.  The rooks are connected, the king is relatively safe, and I'm ready to push those pawns.  The rest will have to be a balance of offense and defense...} e6 {?!  This was unexpected.  Rather than challenging white in the center, black steps tentatively.  Is he preparing to play d5?  And if he plays d5, would I be better served by responding e5 or cxd5?  Either way, I already have a great plan...} 11. h4 {Of course.  Rdg1 looks pretty good, as does g4.  In hindsight, g4 may have been a little better, because h5 wouldn't be quite the same in that instance.} Qe7 {But black plays Qe7, the only move other than d5 that's really consistent with 12. e6.} 12. g4 {Now, we're in business.  White's attack looks like it's coming fast and furious (and it's only move 12)!  Why can't I play this well all the time?} Rac8 {Maybe he is going for c5, after all?  I start thinking about what he can do and what I can do, and I decide that maybe it's a good idea to just pay some slight attention to defense...} 13. Kb1 {And play Kb1?!  Not sure that it's necessary here, as black never really does anything with the Rac8.  However, it certainly puts the white king in a safer spot, allowing me to focus, unfettered, on the attack.} c6 {?  This one just gets a question mark.  Black has basically ceded a large, well-developed center and piece/pawn structure to white with no compensation.  If white plays accurately, his superior position should translate into a win.} 14. Ng3 {A good move, preparing h5.  Black's kingside is about to be cracked open.  Also good here for white is Rdg1.} e5 {Finally!  Black makes a play for the center.  After analyzing a few lines, it's pretty clear that d5 is a much better option than dxe5. } 15. d5 {This takes the e6 square away for any black pieces to position themselves on.} cxd5 {A nice try.  After cxd5, the c-file is completely open, and white's Bd3 is boxed in by the e4 pawn.} 16. exd5 {!  But if white eschews the conventional wisdom, and doesn't capture towards the center, this position suddenly turns into an overwhelming one.  The bishops, the queen, the Ng3, and the Rh1 all point menacingly at the black king.  The advanced kingside pawns are ready to make good on their threats.    And with the e4 square open, black's position cramped and his light-squared bishop out of play, the situation is about to become dire.} Nc5 {Not a bad try, as it immediately puts the question to the Bd3, "what are you gonna do with your life?"  But this move also has the drawbacks of moving the knight farther away from the kingside, where he's going to be needed, and no good way to get back there, as the e4 and e6 squares are not controlled by black.} 17. Bc2 {Well, the very fact that the black kingside is what's at stake here is all the more reason for the light squared bishop to stay on the b1-h7 diagonal!  The Nc5 is effectively out of play, also.} a5 {Going for me on the queenside now?  But this must be too slow; my kingside attack is almost there!} 18. h5 {Time to push forward.  Something's going to give in black's kingside: either he'll play g5, gxh5, or else I'll play hxg6!} gxh5 {Easy enough.  Now the choice is whether to retake with the knight, the rook or the pawn?} 19. Nxh5 {This move is better than gxh5, as it keeps the rook on the open file, and also threatens the f6 and g7 squares.} Nxh5 {Given all of the options, this may not have been the best.  If black was going to play Nxh5, he should have left the other knight on d7, so it could fill the void on f6.} 20. Rxh5 {Wow!  After just a couple of exchanges, white now threaten to turn his advantage into a winning one with threats on h7.  Also, the ability to form a battery down the h-file is not without its menace...} f6 {?!  While this move prevents Bg5, it does nothing to address the threats to h7.} 21. Rxh7 {Bxh7 also has a case to be made for it, but this move pins the Bg7 and really opens the h-file up for battery action!} Kf7 {?!  A move I don't really understand, but black has a huge number of problems at this point.  The instinct to run can hardly be faulted.} 22. Bh6 {Nice!  The pin on the bishop means that black's only option is to add another defender to g7.} Reg8 {Easy enough; Qf7 simply drops a queen for a rook.} 23. Rh1 {Bringing the second rook over to the h-file!  White is placing a lot of pressure on the black king and kingside pieces.  Will black be able to weather the storm?} Rcf8 {?!  A reasonable idea, but Ke8 was better in hindsight, breaking the pin and preventing white's little upcoming trick...} 24. Bxg7 {!  This wins a piece.  At this point, black is busted, but he doesn't realize it.  Think about it. White wants to play Bxf8+, and no matter what black does, he loses his queen.  But the only other option is Rxg7...} Rxg7 {And now black's gone and played it.    Guess what?  White now has a forced mate.} 25. Bg6+ {!  And black gets to choose between 25... Kxg6 26. Qh6+ Kf7 27. Qxg7+ Ke8 28. Qxe7# and 25... Kg8 26. Rh8#.  One of the only games where I (possibly) didn't make a big mistake!    Thanks to my Captain for letting me make him famous!  I'll play this good against my team opponents... someday!}
