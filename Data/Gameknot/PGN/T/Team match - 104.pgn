1. c4 {English opening. } e6 2. e4 d5 3. cxd5 exd5 4. exd5 Qxd5 5. Qa4+ Bd7 6. Qh4 Be7 7. Qf4 Nf6 {QxPc7 works.} 8. Bc4 {QxPg2 hurts white.} Qe4+ 9. Qe3 {Oops, this leaves the bishop undefended.  Black should play QxBc4. } O-O 10. Nc3 {White's bishop still beckons. } Qxe3+ 11. dxe3 Be6 {White splits black's pawns by trading bishops.  Split pawns are harder for black to defend. } 12. b3 Nc6 13. Nf3 a6 14. O-O Bd6 15. Nd5 {Black has more power here (bishop plus knight), this sacrifices the knight for nought. } Bxd5 16. a4 Bxf3 {Black breaks white's castle, doubling pawns.} 17. gxf3 Rab8 {Rad8 probably would likely have been better.  Rook on center file exerts greater control over the battlefield. } 18. f4 Ne7 19. h4 Nh5 20. e4 {Withdrawing cover for Pf4 gives black this pawn.  White's black bishop cannot compete against black's knight and bishop. } Ng6 {Black would have been better off taking the pawn.  The other pawn, h4, is easy pickings. } 21. f5 Ne5 {NxPh4 seems better. } 22. f4 Nd7 {All even trades now favor black, given the knight advantage.  NxBc4 also splits white pawns.} 23. f6 {Two knights chomp this bit.  But it is a clever ruse, allowing whit to pawn fork black.  Still, NdxPf6 works, because bc5+ let's black escape the fork.   } Nhxf6 24. e5 Ne4 {Nope.  When forked, counter threat. } 25. Bd3 Ng3 {Rf3 keeps pressure on the knight.  White will make back a bishop or knight. } 26. Rf3 Nh5 27. Bf5 f6 28. exd6 {Good choice. } Rfd8 {Yikes!  PxPc7 forks black's rooks!  Blunder! } 29. dxc7 Nf8 30. cxd8=Q {The other rook robs black's control over the center. } Rxd8 31. Ba3 g6 32. Be4 Ne6 33. f5 {I like BxPb7 better.} Nd4 {Rd3 pins that pesky knight. } 34. Rd3 {Yes!} Nf4 {Keep it on the D file.} 35. Re3 {:(. Nc2 forks the rooks.  But black must push the white bishop first. } gxf5 36. Bxb7 Nc2 37. Rc3 {I like Rf3 better.} Nxa1 38. Bxa6 Ne2+ {Black ignore's the bishop. } 39. Kf2 {BxNe2 was SUCH a better move.} Nxc3 40. Be7 Re8 {BxPf6 pins black knights. } 41. Bxf6 Nxb3 42. Bxc3 Nc5 {While a bishop pawn combo is usually good, Ne4+ gives black another bishop. } 43. Bb5 h5 {Rook sacrificed. } 44. Bxe8 Ne4+ 45. Kf3 Nxc3 46. Kf4 {}
