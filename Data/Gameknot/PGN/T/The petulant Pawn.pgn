1. e4 {"When I get a chance to promote you dear, now just concentrate on the game."} e6 2. c4 {"Daddy that is not right. You are meant to play d4." "I wanted to try something else Paula."} Nc6 3. Nf3 e5 4. Nc3 Bc5 5. Nxe5 {"Oh goody, you have got rid of that pawn which was blocking me...."} Nxe5 6. d4 Bd6 7. c5 Be7 8. dxe5 {"Dad! Now there is another pawn in the way." "Good grief! Now I know what Nimzowitch was on about, and how pawns have a lust to expand!"} Bxc5 9. Bc4 Ne7 {"Just be patient and count your blessings Paula. It is a great honour to be part of the team. And look at the education you are getting. "Oh dad I know about backward pawns, isolated pawns, passed pawns, capturing pawns en passant. When do I get to be a queen?"} 10. O-O O-O 11. Na4 d6 12. Nxc5 dxc5 {"Dad! You had the chance to get rid of the pawn which is in my way." "I know, but I felt it more important to double his pawns."} 13. Be3 b6 14. Qb3 Nc6 15. e6 {"Bravo! The pawn in the way is going!"} fxe6 16. Bxe6+ {"And now I am a passed pawn. I am going to win this game for you daddy."} Kh8 17. Rad1 Qf6 18. Bxc8 Raxc8 {"I think you need a bit more support first Paula"} 19. f4 Rce8 20. e5 {"Here we go here we go....} Qg6 21. Qd3 {"That's right, get those queens off. I want to be the only queen on the board, when I get to the other side."} Red8 22. Qxg6 hxg6 23. h4 {"Good move dad! that stops him from playing g5 and removing my support."} Nd4 24. Rd2 Nf5 25. Kf2 Nd4 26. g4 {"mmmm we are on the march again, and his stupid knight can't go back to f5 again...."} Rd5 27. Kg2 c6 28. b4 Ne6 {"Dad! He is blockading me again, and with the best blockader, his knight." "Don't worry Paula, it is all under control."} 29. bxc5 Rxd2+ 30. Bxd2 Nxc5 31. Bb4 Rd8 32. Bxc5 bxc5 {"Ha ha, all his pawns are doubled and/or isolated. We are going to win this, and I am going to win it for us!"} 33. Rc1 Rd2+ 34. Kf3 Rxa2 35. e6 {"One step closer. Nearly there now."} Kg8 {"If only it wasn't for that big bad black king."} 36. Rxc5 Kf8 37. Rxc6 {"We are a pawn up now.... one-nil one-nil....."} Ke7 {"Don't let him stop me daddy!"} 38. f5 {"good more support, that is what I need"} gxf5 39. gxf5 Ra3+ {"he has gone mad. He is driving us up the board to just where you want to be daddy."} 40. Kg4 {"That's right, come and help me daddy!"} Kf6 41. Rc8 Ra4+ 42. Kh5 Kxf5 43. e7 {"Nearly there now. He can't stop me!"} g6+ {mmm only one move here.....} 44. Kh6 Kf6 45. e8=N+ {"Oh daddy you PROMISED! Why only a knight, why can't I be a queen daddy?" "Because he wins with Rxh4 if you become a queen." "Oh yeh"} Kf5 {I'm going to check him, I'm going to check him...} 46. Nd6+ Kg4 47. Kxg6 Kxh4 {Draw agreed. "But why did you agree a draw daddy?" "Because dearest daughter with only knight and rook against rook and king I cannot win, even if I win his a pawn. I have run out of pawns to queen!" And with that Paula was quickly put back in her box and the lid was firmly shut before she could ask any more annoying questions.}
