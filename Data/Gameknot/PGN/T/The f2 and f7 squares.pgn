[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence, 4.O-O"]

1. e4 {I start with my usual.} e5 {I wasn't sure how Carole was going to respond.  But, once she played this, I played my next move.  As I was preparing for what comes next being the Spanish Opening.  With that, I bet that she was either taught that by one of her coaches in the Sixth Sense Team, or that was played in a vote game.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {But, this move shows that one of those two things happened because ION told me that Janet is an expert with the Berlin Defense.  I am also familiar with this since this has often been played against me.  Likewise, I have played in Reversion's Open Fire since it was a 1.e4 e5 themed opening.} 4. O-O {With that being said, I stick to the mainlines.} h5 {But, Carole does not here because my last move is often followed up with 4...Nxe4 and then 5.Re1 which gets back the pawn.  In response to this move, I'll continue my development with the move that I used to play in response to the Berlin Defense.  That's right, it's 5.Nc3.} 5. Nc3 a6 {I was surprised to Carole kick my B here.  So, I play as though it were the mainline because aside from 3...Nf6, 3...a6 is played with the same continuation that will occur here.} 6. Ba4 b5 7. Bb3 b4 {I was surprised to see Carole play this.  But, in response...} 8. Nd5 {I centralize my N, and am ready to exchange.  That's because after 9.exd5 white wins a pawn since black is forced to retreat and then some, as we're about to see.} Nxd5 9. exd5 Ne7 10. Nxe5 {As now, the weakest square that I mentioned earlier is going to become target.  When that happens, things will start to become dangerous.} f6 11. d6 {And, that's why I played this, as opposed to, retreating.  By playing 10...f6, Carole is in trouble.  What I keep in mind is what TA said about what happens after the f pawn advances which is what I remember when teaching my students the problems with the Domiano's Defense.  As now, mate is threatened.  And, at best, Carole will lose a piece without compensation.  One example would be 11...Nd5 12.Bxd5 Bb7 13.Bxb7, and if 13...fxe5, 14.Bxa8  There are other variations that I calculated, but this is just one of them.  } cxd6 {?? Trying to prevent the loss of material, Carole takes the pawn, but overlooked the mate which is going to happen on the weakest square here.} 12. Bf7# {On top of, getting your pieces developed, the other important lesson is to be careful on the f file.  The example is why Joe is able to win after sacking his Queen for pawn.  One perspective is because he's stronger.  But, the main reason is that those sacs usually occur on the f file.  And, that is how his opponents become overly confident.  So, that is what needs to be watched out for as letting it become target could spell disaster.}
