1. Nf3 d6 {!? Interesting. Book is d5.} 2. g3 {!? This is an inaccuracy. e4 was best.} e5 3. e4 Nf6 4. Nc3 {or d3.} c5 5. Bg2 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. d3 {? Waste of a move.} Be6 {He covers the hole.} 8. Bg5 {I threaten to trade of one of the defenders of d5.} Nc6 9. Bxf6 {!? Ne2} Bxf6 10. Ne2 g6 11. c3 {I prepare d4.} b5 12. d4 {12. b3 preparing c4.} exd4 13. cxd4 Bc4 {This bishop becomes a headache throughout the whole game.} 14. d5 Nb4 15. a3 {Go ahead. Chat, Lake-bay that move was horrendous.} Bxb2 16. Rb1 Bxa3 {I overlooked that. It pays to use the 'analyze the board' window!} 17. Nd2 {I try to generate a counterattack since the bishop isn't going anywhere.} Bd3 {! This sets a trap I fell hard for!} 18. Rb3 {??} Qa5 {?? Returning the favor! Bc2!! was correct.} 19. Nb1 {? I am not learning from past failures.} Bc2 {Only this time...} 20. Rxa3 {I have the last laugh. We now have a massive material swap.} Bxd1 21. Rxa5 Bxe2 22. Re1 Bd3 {An even trade. I am still down two pawns.} 23. Nc3 a6 24. e5 {My last effort.} dxe5 {I was hoping for ..Rfe8?, e6! } 25. Rxe5 Rfe8 26. f4 {I decide to exchange on my own grounds.} Rxe5 {!? Sharper was Rd8.} 27. fxe5 {I have two powerful central pawns.} Re8 28. d6 {My only hope.} Bf5 {The only move. Anything else allows the pawn to queen.} 29. Nd5 {I thought I was winning now.} Nxd5 30. Bxd5 Rxe5 31. Bc6 {This was my big moment!} Re1+ {!! My confidence was misguided.} 32. Kf2 Rd1 33. Rxa6 c4 34. Bxb5 {I groan when I see this. Ra3! was correct.} c3 35. Ba4 Ra1 36. Rc6 Rxa4 37. Rxc3 {We still exchange.} Ra6 38. g4 {I fire my last guns.} Bxg4 39. Rd3 Bd7 {Everything else fails.} 40. Kf3 f5 {At the time I thought this was a mistake. This is actually quite strong.} 41. Kf4 Kf7 42. Ke5 {Better Kg5.} Ra5+ {The real groan moment.} 43. Kd4 Ke6 44. Rh3 {I saw my planned Kc4 would be punished by Bb5+!} Kxd6 45. Rxh7 f4 46. Ke4 Rf5 {! I didn't see that coming!} 47. Rh6 Bc6+ {Another groan moment!} 48. Kd4 Rf6 49. h4 {My only hope.} f3 50. h5 f2 51. hxg6 {I debated Rxg6 but that fails too. At this point he chatted 'make sure to annotate my victory!' 'No problem, I'll blow out of proportion how Big Bertha was killed!' I replied.} f1=Q 52. g7 Qf2+ 53. Kd3 {All else gets me a fork between K&R} Rxh6 54. g8=Q {Now time to live up to my promise. I will kill Big Bertha!} Rh3+ 55. Kc4 Qf4# {How sad. Big Bertha lived to tell the tale.}
