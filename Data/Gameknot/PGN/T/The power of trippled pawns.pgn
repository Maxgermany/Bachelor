1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 {I should mention that 7. Nd5 is a more positional approach and the play that ensues is of a quite different nature. This move is more natural and most critical test to the defense as a whole. Games that arise are very complicated and can quickly turn at the slightest inaccuracy.} a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 {Again 9. Nd5 is slightly more positional, but even against that Black can mix it up with a well timed Ne7. See my annotated game against baldvin.} gxf6 10. Nd5 f5 {10...Bg7 is the other alternative. This modern opening seems to contradict all classical opening principles. Black has moved 6 of his 8 pawns, developed only one piece so far and still he's the one striking at the center. On top of that he has a weakened K-side, a backward pawn on an open file and he's still some moves away from castling. Classical Grandmasters would have been appalled at playing like this. Yet, practice has proven it to be one of the toughest nuts to crack against e4. Maybe there will come a day when computers will prove it to be unsound but until that day human players having the White side will have to solve the Sveshnikov problem themselves.} 11. c3 {The whole reason why this line is even playable for Black is because of the misplaced Na3. If the Knight was on a more normal square, Black would have a lost positional game. So many White players, my opponent included, favor an early re-routing of the Knight to a better square.} Bg7 {The greedy response 11...fxe4 gets punished by 12. Bxb5 axb5 13. Naxb5 Be6 14. Nbc7+ Kd7 15. Nxa8 Bxd5 ( 15...Qxa8? 16. Nb6+) 16. Qxd5 Qxa8 and White has a very firm grip on the position.} 12. Bd3 Be6 {This defends f5 tactically, since 13. exf5 doesn't work because of the simple 13...Bxd5 and White is just a piece down.} 13. Qh5 {A very aggressive response, taking advantage of the weakened K-side and the lack of Knight on f6.} O-O {Apparently this move loses outright to 14. exf5 Bxd5 15. f6, but Black has enough resources to fight back, 15...e4 16. fxg7 Re8! 17. Be2 (17. Qxd5 is weaker because of 17...exd3+ 18. Kd2 Qf6 and Black is the one with the attack all of a sudden!) Re5 18. Qh6. White has been pushed back and Black can choose now to exchange Queens or to keep them on and play the middlegame.} 14. O-O {Sheltering the King and now exf5 is a real threat.} f4 {Gaining space on the K-side but the drawback is that now White has time to strike on the other wing. Black must be ready to defend or to counter-attack.} 15. Nc2 f5 {The doubled f-pawns are more dangerous than they seem. Now 16. exf5 is less scary and Black simple take the piece on d5. But White, just like Black can play on either wing.} 16. a4 {A strike in the center countered by an attack on the flank. Steinitz must be turning in his grave. Yet this plan is very dangerous for Black because if his K-side counterplay isn't strong enough, he might just find himself in a lost endgame a few moves and exchanges later.} Bxd5 17. exd5 {This adheres more to the classical principles. I fix the center so flank plans gain in strength. The only problem is that White is playing on the flanks, too.} Ne7 18. axb5 {And there it is. White wins a pawn and Black's compensation seems wanting. All I get for the minus material is a tempo to push the central pawn mass forward.} e4 19. Bc4 axb5 20. Bxb5 Rb8 21. Na3 {The d-pawn is untouchable because of the nasty pin that would follow on the a2-g8 diagonal. Also I'd like to point out the fact that I have a dsb and White has a lsb. For those that are unaware of the dangers of such middlegames, what follows should be a good example of the basic principle Botvinnik laid out roughly 50 years ago: "In such middlegames, the side with the initiative plays with an extra piece." This seems a little counter intuitive since opposite color Bishop endgames are very drawish but this works exactly the opposite with extra pieces. Even with only a pair of Rooks on the board, the side attacking can make the Bishop feel like a full extra piece. Things are even more clear cut when Queens are still in play.} Ng6 {White has maneuvered his pieces to the Q-side, I shuffle them to the K-side. Note that I don't have any threats yet, just a crude attacking plan of advancing the pawns.} 22. Rab1 {Protecting b2 and trying to untangle the Na3-Bb5 knot on the Q-side.} f3 {There is no time like the present and in situations where you're material short, lingering isn't a possibility.} 23. g3 {The funny trap 23. gxf3 Nf4, captures the Queen. In fact Nf4 is a tangible threat, especially in connection with an intermediate Rxb5, so White's response in forced.} Ne5 {The Knight reaches an ideal square. Notice that White's Queen isn't doing much on the K-side anymore, but my opponent doesn't have a fast escape route.} 24. c4 {This move might look obvious but I can only see the obvious drawbacks. White isolates his Bishop on the Q-side, he weakens b2 and deprives his Knight of the ideal c4 square.} f4 {There is no stopping the Black army. Not only have the pawns advanced very close to the White monarch, but I also gained a lot of space on the K-side, space which is vital in creating attacking plans.} 25. Nc2 {White plays a natural defensive move, but the Knight must have deja vu already. He's been down this path already and must be dizzy by now. Slightly better was getting the Bishop to c2 via a4 and clearing b5 for the Knight. But it's not easy deciding to allow pawns so close to the first rank so early on in the game.} Nd3 {Now I was feeling more confident. Notice how little the Bb5 is doing in covering the white squares. And it is those very light squares he's need on, since it's only from a light square that a Knight can attack a dark square and thus make that opposite color Bishop weigh more heavily in the attack.} 26. Qh3 {White's lady finally sounding the retreat but I think it's too late by now.} Kh8 {I've seen many a game in which Kasparov made a very quiet King move, not much different from this, to extinguish all hope of counterplay from his opponent's mind. I couldn't resist doing the same. Moves like this are very strong OTB since they have a very strong psychological mark, making your opponent lose a lot of confidence in his/hers position. In CC although, such effects are far less felt.} 27. b4 {A brave move, accepting the gauntlet and daring me to prove my previous move's worth.} Qb6 {All of a sudden the Black squares around the King are very weak. This is what I was talking about with my earlier reference to the Botvinnik adage.} 28. Rb3 {Preparing to sacrifice the exchange. The Nd3 is just to well placed.} Bd4 {Not the best move, 28...Nxf2! was stronger, not giving White time to sac the exchange for defensive purposes.} 29. Nxd4 {What's this? It seems my opponent has changed his mind. Now the exchange sac is less good because I can recapture with the Queen and keep the pawns mobile.} Qxd4 {I love a central Queen and for good reason. Just compare the two ladies on the board and see who strikes your fancy more, the one stealing the show in the middle of the board or the one cowering on the side, waiting in vain for a dance invitation.} 30. Bd7 {With the idea of Bg4. But it's far too late. This Bishop has done next to nothing for White's game since he captured the pawn. The fat shall not inherit the Earth.} Nxf2 {No more reprise for the White King. The Black infantry shall be ruthless.} 31. Rxf2 e3 {A full piece down, Black is winning. And all of it because of the 'weak' pawns White created by his own volition as early as move 9. The weak seldom triumph, but when they do, their triumph is that much more inspiring.} 32. Qf1 {Forced.} exf2+ 33. Kh1 {Black got the material back with an interest. The trippled f-pawns are limiting all of White's heavy pieces.} Rbe8 {Sacrificing the exchange to get to e1 and capture the Queen.} 34. Be6 {White doesn't yield but the dark squares are still very much an issue for him.} fxg3 35. hxg3 Rf6 {Faced with serious material loses just to stave off mate, my opponent resigned here.}
