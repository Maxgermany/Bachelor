1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 cxb2 5. Bxb2 Bb4+ {My opponent allowed me to feast on a full Danish, hoping to attack my position before I could develop it. This check buys me a tempo, as my opponent has to either block the line of his B or develop his N to an undesirable square.} 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. Bxf7+ Kxf7 {I accept the exchange of Bishops [after his Q checks to regain the piece], as with my Q side Pawns, every simplification aids me in getting to an advantageous end game.} 8. Qb3+ d5 9. Qxb4 Nc6 {Devloping with tempo, as the Q must retreat.} 10. Qb3 Nd4 11. Qd1 dxe4 {Consolidating my endgame Pawn advantage and hoping to open the Q file to exchange off the Queens.} 12. Nxe4 Re8 13. Bxd4 Nxe4 {With a nasty threat of dicovered check [...N-N6 dis ch wins the Exchange, ...N-B6 dis Ch wins the Q.]} 14. Qb3+ Be6 15. Qf3+ Nf6 {Now threatening ...B-Q4 dis ch winning the Q.} 16. Ne2 Bc4 {I think I'm about to win a piece, as I threaten both BxN and QxB. However, my opponent defends with great accuracy.} 17. Be3 Kg8 {Unpinning the Knight and giving shelter to my King.} 18. O-O Qd5 19. Qxd5+ Nxd5 {My opponent plays into my hands by trading Queens. Now I have an advantageous end game with my mobile Q-side Pawn majority.} 20. Rfe1 Nxe3 21. Nd4 Nd5 {I had expected 21 PxN RxP, but if my opponent doesn't want to recapture...} 22. Rec1 b5 23. h3 Re2 {My turn to blunder. First he gives away a Bishop, now I give away the Exchange. Not a good display of chess in this 3-move stretch.} 24. Nxe2 Bxe2 25. a4 b4 {Now I have an advanced passed Pawn, plus the QB pawn in reserve. In spite of my mistake, I should still be able to force a win.} 26. Rc2 Bh5 27. Rc5 Bf7 {Securely guarding the Knight.} 28. Kf1 Rb8 {Preparing to advance the powerful Pawn.} 29. Ke2 Nf4+ 30. Kf3 Nd5 {A little bit of maneuvering before the action starts.} 31. Ke4 b3 {Expecting 32 RxN BxR KxB K-B2, with a won Rook and Pawn ending.} 32. Rb1 Nf6+ 33. Kd4 Bg6 {Trying to drive the Rook away from the promoting square.} 34. Rb2 Bc2 35. Rxc7 Rb4+ {Winning the last White Q-side Pawn.} 36. Kc5 Rxa4 37. Kd6 {And after making this move, White resigns. The Q-side Pawns will decide after the Rook is forced away from N2.}
