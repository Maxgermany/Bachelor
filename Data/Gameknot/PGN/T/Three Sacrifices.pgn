1. e4 {A Mini-tournament game, I'm playing white and open with the Open Game.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez} Nf6 4. d3 {The e5 pawn is safe, but not for long, so white defends it against future attacks.} Bc5 5. c3 h6 6. Bxc6 {Black has decided to leave his pawn at e5 hanging, so white goes in for the grab.} dxc6 7. Nxe5 Qe7 8. Nf3 {Back home like it never happened. Acting all innocent while he wipes the blood off of his lance.} Bg4 9. O-O O-O-O 10. Qe2 {9. ... 0-0-0 put the black rook on d8, pinning the d3 pawn to the white queen, which effectively left the e4 pawn unprotected. This move unpins the defending pawn.} Rd7 11. Nbd2 Rhd8 12. d4 {d3 was getting a little hot, so d4, defended by a pawn, seems safer. This was the reason behind 11. Nbd2, defending e4 so the d-pawn would be free to advance.} Bb6 13. a4 a6 14. h3 Bh5 15. g4 {Driving off the unwanted black LSB.} Nxg4 16. hxg4 {Except black didn't want to be driven off. 15. ... Nxg4? probably deserves a question mark since black didn't have anything terribly threatening to follow it up with. The white knight on f3 shuts black's queen out of h4 and g5, and Bxf3 won't work because white would reply Nxf3 and the other knight, now at f3, would still shut out the black queen. With another piece or two ready to pounce, this kind of sacrifice in front of white's king can be very effective. The first sacrifice is a dubious one at best.} Bxg4 17. Nc4 {White is ahead a piece for a pawn, time to consider liquidating material.} Bxd4 18. cxd4 {More sacrificing from black, but this time it's very dangerous. If white handles the next couple of moves badly, black will obtain a winning advantage.} Rd7xd4 19. Nxd4 {White's turn to sacrifice, recapturing with the pinned knight. The third sacrifice is pretty much forced. If white had tried to hold everything, for example, with 19. Ncd2 which rescues the knight from c4, defends the pawn at e4, and defends the knight at f3, black's follow up 19. ... Qf6 puts winning pressure on the white knight at f3. It cannot move because it is pinned. If the knight at d2 moves, the knight at f3 falls. At this point, black would be threatening 20. ... Rxd2 21. Bxd2 Bxf3 and now with the threat of mate, white might very well be forced to sacrifice the queen with 22. Qxf3 Qxf3 and black will go on to win with a crushing material superiority. Since white can't find a way to hold it all together, relieving the pressure by giving back some of his material edge seemed called for.} Bxe2 20. Nxe2 {OK, the theory now is that black can't checkmate white's exposed king with only a queen and a rook, not with all the white pieces around. I hope.} Qxe4 21. Ne3 {Consolidating and defending the king.} Rd6 22. Ng3 {A shield against 22. Rg6+ and an attack on black's queen.} Qf3 23. Ra3 {An indirect attack against black's rook threatening 24. Nc4 discovering the attack from the white rook on a3 against the black queen on f3.} Rd7 24. Nef5 {The knights defend each other.} Qg4 25. Kg2 {Must protect h3. Black's queen can be allowed no access, so even the king must do his part.} Kb8 26. Re1 {A rook on the 8th would be very dangerous, and a rook on the 7th would force an exchange of material. Both good.} Qg6 27. Re8+ {26. Qg6? was a mistake. It lets white win the exchange.} Ka7 28. Ne7 {Now black's queen must move, or black's rook can exchange for the knight. Either way, that knight is getting the black rook.} Qc2 29. Rc3 {Now simply play 29. Nf8+ K-any, 30. Nb6+ (or ++) Ka7 31. Nxd7 Qxc1 and white wins the exchange. But instead, white wanted to save the bishop on c1. Black's queen can go anywhere she likes, and white will still get that black rook. If black defends the rook, white will only win the exchange, but will have kept the potentially strong bishop.} Qxa4 30. Nc8+ {Oops. Black went for the undefended pawn. 29. Qxa4?? is a serious blunder, because now white plays the same combination but wins black's queen instead of the rook. 30. ... K-any, 31. Nb6+ Ka7 32. Nxa4 leaves white ahead with two rooks+two knights+bishop vs. black's rook+5 pawns. All those pieces can easily stop black's pawns, so black resigns.}
