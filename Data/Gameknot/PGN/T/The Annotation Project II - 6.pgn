1. f4 {This is another game starting from a preset series of moves.  Our free will begins at move 7.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 {So far, what has become the main line, I think.} Nd7 {Black varies from the usual 9...Bg7.  He's still developing a piece, so it's not necessarily a bad move.} 10. Ne6 {White continues with the usual knight move that restrains the Black e-pawn and attacks the Black Q.} Nf6 {?!  Now Black really surprised me by returning the Q immediately.  Perhaps he thought he'd get 2 pieces for the Q but he only gets 1, so White is then a comfortable piece ahead.  Perhaps he just didn't see that the Q was under attack (believe me, it's possible, especially if you're playing a hundred games simultaneously and not looking at the board properly). Whatever, it was an interesting approach.} 11. Nxd8+ Rxd8 12. Be6 {The bishop replaces the N on e6, escaping the attentions of Black's remaining N.  Now, all White has to do is complete his development and he wins, surely?} b6 {This creates an escape hole for Black's King.} 13. O-O Kb7 14. Nc3 Kb8 {Black is using several tempi to secure his K, without developing any other pieces.  Is this a wise investment?} 15. Re1 {Perhaps a second move with the KR is a bit strange when the QB and QR are still trapped on the back row but I thought this the best route to freeing them, since if I could get rid of the Black e4 pawn I could develop freely.} Rd6 16. Bb3 {The other main choice was 16. Bh3 but the B has less freedom of movement there and, compared with other games in this tournament, the B has less reason to stay on the h3-c8 diagonal.} Bg7 {Finally Black occupies the long diagonal.} 17. Nxe4 Nxe4 18. Rxe4 {Every exchange favours White, so I was happy with this.} Rf8 19. c3 {Not only does this support a future d4 but also gives the lsb more options.  If I'd not played this, even after moving the d-pawn, I couldn't have developed the dsb without allowing ...Bxb2.} a5 {All Black's Q-side pawns are now on Black squares.  These may offer support to his B but also restrict its movement.  One always has to be careful in calculating the relative benefits and risks associated with such decisions.  I'm not sure this was the most relevant move right now.} 20. d4 {But this was.} h5 {Black is ceding the central ground for sniping from the flanks but he only has one Bishop: not necessarily a strategy that fits the material balance.} 21. Rxe7 {and giving away material unnecessarily..} Bf6 22. Rf7 Rxf7 23. Bxf7 {another swap benefits White, who is two pawns and a piece up now.} Bd8 24. Be3 {Finally the second Bishop is activated.  As noted before, pawns of the same colour get in the way, so it didn't have a lot of choice about where to go.  Perhaps I should have advanced the f-pawn first, swapping it for Black's h-pawn, then advanced the B to f4.} Rf6 25. Bd5 h4 26. Rf1 {and White completes his development on move 26...  This is late for a gambit such as this game started with.} Be7 27. a3 {This suggests that the QR may have been better on a1 still.  White is preparing to open lines to Black's King.} h3 {Black makes contact first.} 28. gxh3 Rf5 29. Be4 Rh5 30. Bxg6 {A good swap from White's point of view, giving up the doubled pawn for Black's one remaining Kingside pawn.} Rxh3 31. Bf2 Rh8 32. Bg3 {The manoeuvre Be3-f2-g3 has prevented the Bg6 from being pinned and realigned the dsb on the Black King's diagonal, also defending h2.  The plan now is simply to push the f-pawn to f8 and get a Queen.  There's no need to continue with the frontal assault on Black's King, mentioned earlier.} Rg8 33. f5 Bf8 34. Re1 Bh6 {? allows White to swap rooks, further enhancing his advantage.} 35. Re8+ Rxe8 36. Bxe8 Bc1 {Black goes pawn-hunting.} 37. b4 Bxa3 38. bxa5 bxa5 39. f6 Bf8 40. c4 Kc8 41. c5 Kd8 42. f7 Bg7 43. Be5 Bh6 44. Bf6+ Kc8 45. Be7 Be3+ 46. Kg2 Bxd4 47. f8=Q {Mission accomplished.  The end is nigh.} Bc3 48. Bc6# {}
