1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch Game, a rather old-fashioned opening.} exd4 4. Bc4 {Choosing to play for the attack rather than maintaining material equality.} Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Re1 {Krstic has sacrificed two Pawns but has the open file and a powerful pin.} d5 7. Bxd5 Qxd5 8. Nc3 Qh5 {Ujtumen, too, chooses to be aggressive.} 9. Nxe4 Be6 10. Bg5 Bb4 {Counterattack on Krstic's Rook.} 11. c3 dxc3 12. bxc3 Be7 {Ujtumen finally prepares to move his King to safety by castling.} 13. Rb1 O-O 14. Rxb7 {Krstic has recovered all his sacrificed material. In addition, his pieces are more aggressively posted.} Bxg5 15. Nexg5 Nd8 {Ujtumen's forces are in retreat now.} 16. Rxc7 h6 17. Ne4 Qa5 {17...B-N5 would be more aggressive. Down by a Pawn, Ujtumen can no longer be passive.} 18. Rc5 Qxa2 19. Nd4 Rb8 {Finally activating the QR.} 20. Qd3 Rb6 21. Nf6+ {Krstic's pieces are well placed, making this sacrifice possible.} gxf6 22. Rh5 f5 23. Rxh6 {Ujtumen's K-side defenses have been shattered.} Kg7 24. Qh3 Rg8 25. Qh4 {Krstic's mating threats are becoming a serious menace.} Qd5 26. c4 Qd7 27. c5 Rc6 28. Rh7+ {If Krstic follows up with 29 R-R8, Ujtumen would practically be forced to resign. But by now both men faced a severe time crunch.} Kf8 29. Qh6+ Ke8 30. Nxf5 {Ujtumen has to counterattack... and he does.} Rxg2+ 31. Kh1 Rg8 32. f3 {The losing move.} Qd5 33. Qh5 Qd2 34. Qh4 Qg2# {A game Ujtumen should have lost. But he found the right moves in time-pressure while Krstic did not.}
