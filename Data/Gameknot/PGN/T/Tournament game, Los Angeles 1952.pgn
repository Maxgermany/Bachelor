[Round "1"]
[White "Meyer "]
[Black "Newcomb "]
[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23), Classical variation"]

1. e4 {Meyer indicates he wants an open game, quickly tactical.} e5 {Newcomb obliges.} 2. Bc4 {An old-fashiooned variant. 2 N-KB3 supplanted this move in popularity around 1830.} Bc5 {Countering symmetrically. 2... N-KB3 is the most solid response, but this move is acceptable.} 3. Qh5 {If properly defensed, this move should not be a threat. But Newcomb fails to properly defense it.} g6 {An error. The correct move was 3... N-KR3, to be followed up with 4... O-O neutralizing any chance of a quick mate and leaving White's Q dangerously exposed.} 4. Qxe5+ {Meyer pounces on the mistake. Black's position is already crumbling.} Ne7 {The alternatives aren't much better. There's no way to avoid losing the KR.} 5. Qxh8+ {The King-hunt is on in earnest.} Ng8 {Forced. Mate is now forthcoming.} 6. Qxg8+ {Closing the ring.} Bf8 {6... K-K2 would have prolonged the game, but Newcomb's position was hopeless anyway.} 7. Qxf7# {Mercifully putting Black out of his misery.}
