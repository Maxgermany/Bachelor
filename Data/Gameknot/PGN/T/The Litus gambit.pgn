[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), classical variation"]

1. b3 {The Nimzo-Larsen attack.} d5 {The second most popular move, after 1… e5.} 2. Bb2 Bg4 {A very strange move, more popular is 2… Nf6, but practice favours black after 2… Bg4, and no so much with 2… Nf6.} 3. f3 {!? The Litus Gambit, strange-looking at first, but very fun to play.} Bf5 {More popular nowadays is 3… Bh5.} 4. e4 dxe4 5. Nc3 {Attacking the e4-pawn.} Nf6 6. Qe2 {!? This is where the Litus Gambit starts to look even stranger. The queen now blocks in the f1-bishop, and it should be clear to black that the queen wants to go to b5, forking the king and bishop.} exf3 7. Qb5+ {The bishop can block, but the b7-pawn is unprotected.} Bd7 8. Qxb7 Bc6 {?? A losing blunder, much better was 8… Nc6! developing a piece and allowing the queen to protect the rook, but now things are going to start looking very ugly for black.} 9. Bb5 {! Showing why 8… Nc6 was better.} f2+ 10. Kxf2 Qxd2+ {The threats on the white king are nothing, and the queen on d2 will provide as a target for white.} 11. Nge2 Ng4+ 12. Kf1 {The only move which doesn't lose.} Ne3+ 13. Kg1 Bxb5 14. Nxb5 {Remember that if it wasn't for the queen on d2, then Qc8 would be mate.} f6 {The game is looking quite unpleasant for black don't you think?} 15. Ned4 e5 16. Bc3 {Finally, black resigns, the Queen is trapped and will soon be lost, plus there are threats of Qxa8 and Qc8+ and all sorts of stuff. Hope you enjoyed, thank you!}
