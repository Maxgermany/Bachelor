[Opening "King's Indian (E97), orthodox, Aronin-Taimanov, bayonet attack"]

1. d4 {Weirdly enough I play 1. e4 all the time, but if you asked me what I'd want to play black against; it is 1. d4.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 {The classical Kings Indian defense. A game with lots of tactics and strategy. For a first timers glance it doesn't seem that strong for black, but these lines are as sharp as they come. } 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 {The idea of this position is that the center is completely blocked off, so advances are more heavy on each wing of the board. But don't twist it into something it's not. Black's main goal is getting to the weak square d4, but that is a very long plan that takes time. In the meantime he'll settle for attacking on the kingside.} 9. b4 {The Bayonet attack. A nice queenside threat, with the option of moving c4-c5 to disrupt black. Some people prefer blacks next move to be 9. ... a5 to prevent it from ever happening, but I'm not one of those people.} Nh5 {Allowing my f-pawn to advance and go along with the King's Indian plan of attacking kingside.} 10. Re1 f5 11. Ng5 {A good spot for the knight. Threatening to go to e6 and clogging up black just a bit. Still, in the mainline of the Bayonet attack.} Nf4 {I know 11. Nf6 is a better move, and I'd recommend anyone who sees this plays it instead of 11. Nf4, but I'd never really tried this move and wanted to see why it was worse.} 12. Bxf4 exf4 {White has created a doubled up pawn, and has made it very easy to obtain, if he chooses. However I said before d4 is what we are playing for to achieve, so now we have a bishop on it, and our opponent has no DSB to challenge it now.} 13. Rc1 {Protecting the unprotected knight.} Bh6 {This move is a little strange, and I only made it because I wanted to see, if I could sucker him into 14. h4 and exposing his kingside a little rather than just moving the knight back to f6. Also, this showed me, if he played this opening enough to know the d4 spot is my main intention even though I took my only piece on it, off it.} 14. h4 {Isn't it nice when luck is on your side?} a5 15. a3 Bg7 {Putting my eye back on my main goal.} 16. Bf3 {I guess he really likes that knight on g5. I really have no idea what he was trying to accomplish with this other than overprotecting e4. } Be5 {I didn't want his e-pawn to advance at any point, so I blocked it and at the same time am guarding my weak pawn.} 17. Ne6 {I don't really like this move, but I guess he was concerned with me attacking his knight. All this really did in my mind was weaken his center.} Bxe6 18. dxe6 Nc6 {Two pieces now on d4. My goals are finally starting to come together. Also, this move attacks that lonely h4 pawn.} 19. exf5 {Trying to cut into my kingside.} Qxh4 {I decided in the spirit of the KID that I'd counter-attack rather than worry. Taking advantage of the weak h-file, does this mean my development is finally complete and we are almost in a middle game when he moves his queen?} 20. Qd5 {A huge blunder and oversight of the strength of what I have. Yes he is thinking of a discover check, but it really amounts to nothing and lets me keep my kingside intact. Way better was fxg6.} Rxf5 {Free pieces are always nice.} 21. Qe4 Bd4 {Finally I achieved where I wanted to be, and I'm already threatening a checkmate. Also, at this point I saw a winning tactic. } 22. Ref1 {Guarding against the threat.} Re5 {Putting my rook in a better position on a basically open file, but mainly apart of my tactical idea.} 23. Qb1 {This was the worst place for the queen and made my life a little easier.} Ne7 24. Nd5 Nf5 {Threatening Ng3. I guess my opponent didn't want to watch all the cool things about to happen because he knew he was going to have to let go of some pieces to save it.}
