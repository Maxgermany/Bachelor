1. e4 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. d3 g6 {I have no idea what to play on this line, so I will concentrate on the d4 square, which looks like a lovely square to control with my knights if possible.} 4. Bd2 Bg7 5. Bc3 {Ah, forcing my hand I think. Could play e5 here but that seems to block my bishop for good, and makes the fianchetto much less useful to me I think.} Nd4 6. Nf3 e6 7. Be2 {This bishop cannot get near the Queenside - that plus both sides being likely to castle kingside makes me aware of the likelihood for a big kingside attack by white if the opportunity presents itself.} Ne7 8. O-O O-O 9. Na3 a6 10. Nc2 {Again, this knight now also appears to move towards the kingside, so I decide to remove one of white's bishops - this may have been a bad call, but my only other options were e5, which I still did not like, and Ne-c6, which may have been the best choice.} Nxe2+ 11. Qxe2 Nc6 {Having decided Nc6 was strong before, this now seems appropriate -- keeps my mobility up and gives proper defence of d4 and e5 again.} 12. Bxg7 Kxg7 13. Qe3 b6 {Defending the c5 pawn.} 14. a3 d6 {Aiming for e5 and leaving the option of both Bg4 and Nd4 open. I also can now look at b5 if the centre locks up.} 15. Rfd1 e5 {Decided to lock the centre, Nd4 is playable if required, and b5 remains useful. I also now look at f5 to bring the rook into play. I could do with more firepower if this is to be the strategy, and will play Ra7 whilst I have no imminent threats, in the hope of playing f5 and having Ra-f7 in the reserves} 16. h3 Ra7 17. b4 f5 18. exf5 Bxf5 19. Rab1 {Presumably attacking the b6 pawn after 20. bxc5 dxc5, or controlling the open file if 20... dxc5 -- Neither of these seem problematic.} Nd4 {Opening up the file -- neither 20... Nxc2 or 20... Nxf3  are nice for white.} 20. Ncxd4 exd4 21. Qc1 Re7 {Takiing control of the open file -- must remember that Queen is tied up defending b6 -- it would be useful to get a rook on e6 to protect against this.} 22. Rb3 Rfe8 23. bxc5 dxc5 24. g4 Bd7 {Possibly allowing b5 later, when c5 pawn won't fall to the white queen.} 25. Re1 {Seems slightly odd, both Rxe1  and Re2 are left for black, and I don't know which is stronger.} Re7xe1+ {Chose to capture as white has to capture with the knight, losing initiative.} 26. Nxe1 Qe7 {Forces the knight to move or be defended, and protects the c5 pawn allowing the b5 push.} 27. Nf3 Qe2 28. Ng5 h6 29. Ne4 h5 {Hoping to formulate a mating threat with bishop and queen, for example after 30. gxh5 Bxh3.} 30. Kh2 Bc6 {b6 pawn is hanging, but hopefully the threats to the f2 pawn (following the capture of the knight) are enough to maintain intiative.} 31. Qf4 Bxe4 {if 32. fxe4 Rxe4 seems strong, and 32... Qxe4 33. Qxe4 Rxe4 34. Rxb6 d3 also seems ok. The exchange will hopefully work in my favour here.} 32. Qc7+ Kh6 33. Qf4+ Kg7 34. Qc7+ Kg8 {Avoiding draw by repetition - White cannot play a check here.} 35. Qf4 Rf8 {Binding the queen.} 36. Qxf8+ {If white did not capture the rook, either the rook would capture the queen or  checkmate was to follow with Qxf2.  However, after 36... Kxf8 the game is well and truly over.} Kxf8 37. dxe4 Qxf2+ 38. Kh1 Qf1+ {Game annotation for team benefit --}
