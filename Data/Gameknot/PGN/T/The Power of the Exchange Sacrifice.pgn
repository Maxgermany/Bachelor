1. e4 {This was a game I played recently in the Birmingham (UK, not Alabama) League 3rd division.} c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 {The Caro-Kann Bayonet variation.} 4. Nf3 e6 5. c4 Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Nd7 {This is all standard play - white aims for a space advantage, while black aims for activity.} 7. Qb3 a5 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 {In the post-mortem, this move received criticism on the grounds that it doubled my pawns. However, I judged that the doubled pawns would give excellent compensation due to the half-open b-file and my concentration in the centre.} Qb6 {I think that this is a poor move, on the grounds that it does little except remove a potentially very powerful peice.However, black's position is quite reasonable.} 10. Qxb6 Nxb6 11. c5 Nd7 {Attempting to maintain the tension in the centre, while preparing ...b6.} 12. c4 Ne7 13. Bg5 h6 {Preventing black castling is not worth losing the advantage of having both bishops.} 14. Bh4 g5 {Besides, the black king's defenses are being stripped away voluntarily! I think that 14...Nc8 is best.} 15. Bg3 Rb8 16. h4 g4 17. Nd2 b6 {Given our respective abilities I was confident that I could outplay the opponent, and so I decided to create some imbalance in the postion to play around with.} 18. cxd5 cxd5 19. Rc1 {At the cost of my pawn structure, I get a passed pawn on the 5th rank; if it was allowed to get any further it could cause serious damage.} bxc5 20. dxc5 {Planning 20...Rc8 21.Bb5.} Nc6 21. a4 {Preparing the next move. Otherwise, it would be hard to justify a move such as this that does not acheive anything otherwise. However, the square b5 is crucial to my plans.} Rb4 22. Bb5 Ndb8 {As any member of my school's chess club's upper echelons will agree (we play weird games), a knight is ideally developed on b8.} 23. O-O O-O {Removing the pin.} 24. Nb1 {Preparing to defend b5.} Rc8 25. Rfd1 Nd4 26. Na3 Nbc6 27. f4 {Getting the bishop to f2 is white's best chance. It also makes sense to reinforce the pawn on e5.} Rb3 {I think en passant is better, as black goes a pawn up with a good position.} 28. Bf2 Nf3+ {28...Rxb5 is interesting, but a bad move because after 29. axb5 Ne2  30. Kf1 Nxc1 the pawns become insanely powerful. I consider the text move to also be inferior because allows white to force a rook onto the b-file.} 29. gxf3 Rxa3 30. fxg4 Bxg4 31. Rd2 Rb3 {Personally I prefer an immediate ...Nb4to this move, in order to gain attacking chances. However, there is even better than this: why not simply play 31...Rf3 to win the f4 pawn and undermine the e5 pawn?} 32. Kh2 {Saving the pawns.} Rf3 33. Bg3 Rb3 34. Rcc2 {Preparing to exchange off the b3 rook, with the plan of Bf2, Rb2, Bxc6 and Rb6.} Nb4 {Now for the exchange sac...} 35. c6 {I judged that I could resist the attack coming, but that, thanks to the two bishops (I said they'd come in handy!) the pawn could only be stopped at great cost.} Nxc2 {There is not much else black can do.} 36. Rxc2 Bf3 {The threat is ...Rb1, which wins the dark squared bishop and leaves white a rook down for nothing.} 37. Bf2 Be4 38. Rc1 Rb2 39. Kg1 {I had not spotted 39...Kh7, which makes 39. Kg3 unviable. However, I was going for the win (I refused a draw offer certainly within the last couple of moves) and thought that it would simply lead to a draw by repetition or my king getting trapped on h5 and mated.} Kh7 {I didn't understand this at first; in fact I didn't understand it at all until the follow-up move.} 40. c7 {One more square to go.} Rg8+ {According to my oppoent, had he played this attack earlier on it would have been unstoppable. However, I believe that it fails whenever he plays it.} 41. Kf1 Bg2+ 42. Ke1 Rxb5 {Very desperate, but the only way to even temporarily prevent promotion.} 43. axb5 Rc8 44. b6 d4 {Letting the bishop cover b7.} 45. Bxd4 Bb7 {Or white plays Rb1 and forces this move.} 46. Kf2 {All that remains is to trap the king.} Kg6 47. Ke3 Kf5 {47...Kh5 48.Rg1 Kxh4 49.f5! also wins for white.} 48. Rg1 {Black is, apart from the pawn on the a-file and the rook, which can choose between a8, c8, e8, f8 and h8, completely paralysed. If ...h5??, then Rg5#} a4 49. Rg7 a3 {49...Rf8 50. Bc5} 50. Rxf7+ Kg6 51. Rf6+ Kg7 52. Rxe6 a2 {The rest is all very simple.} 53. Rd6 Ra8 54. Rd8 {Black cannot prevent promotion.} a1=Q 55. Bxa1 Rxa1 {The position is hopeless for black. My opponent resigned a couple of moves later.} 56. c8=Q Ra3+ {Attempting to slow down the inevitable.} 57. Kd4 Ra4+ 58. Qc4 {White will lost the queen to something, so why not the rook? At this point my opponent resigned since in any case black has lost, e.g.} Rxc4+ 59. Kxc4 Ba6+ 60. Kc5 Kg6 61. Ra8 Bb7 62. Ra7 Bf3 63. b7 Bxb7 64. Rxb7 Kh5 65. Rg7 {Simple.}
