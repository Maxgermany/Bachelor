1. e4 {Mini tournament game, I'm playing white and begin with the open game.} c5 2. Nf3 {Sicilian Defense, of course.} d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 {The ever-popular Najdorf. I respond with the English Attack.} e5 7. Nf3 Be7 8. Bc4 O-O 9. O-O {Developing.} Qc7 10. Qe2 {Defending the bishop, but also clearing d1 for a rook.} Nc6 11. Rad1 {As planned.} Bg4 12. h3 Bh5 13. g4 {Breaking the pin, and preparing a pawn storm on black's king. It's nice when the first two pawn moves can be made with tempo.} b5 14. Bb3 {Black counterattacked, but the plan is still the same.} Bg6 15. Nh4 Qd7 16. Nxg6 {Breaking up the castle.} hxg6 17. f4 Rac8 18. g5 Nh5 19. f5 {White's pesky pawns just keep charging toward the enemy king. Did white just leave g3 for black's knight?} Ng3 20. Qf3 {White has set a little trap for black. I'm hoping he takes the bait. White was not at all afraid of the painless fork with 19. ... Ng3, because 19. f5! had paved the way for much nastiness. If 20. ... Nxf1, then 21. fxg6 Bxg5 22. Bxg5 Ng3 23. Qxg3 Ne7 24. Bxf7+ Rxf7 25. gxf7+ Kxf7 26. Qxe5 leaves white ahead by bishop+pawn.  } gxf5 21. Qxg3 {Black correcly blunts white's attack at the cost of his knight.} f4 22. Qh4 {White seems to be forked again. But again it's a painless fork. Black only thinks he's winning material.} fxe3 23. Rxf7 {Nothing refutes a fork like a good old fashioned sacrifice.} Rxf7 24. Bxf7+ Kxf7 25. Qh5+ Kg8 26. g6 {The king hunt is on.} Qe6 27. Rf1 {Threatens mate in 1 with 28. Qh7#} Bf6 28. Qh7+ Kf8 29. Rxf6+ {Seems white just can't stop sacrificing his rooks. Not 29. ... gxf6? for then 30. g7+ Ke8 31. g8=Q+ Qxg8+ 32. Qxg8+ leaves white ahead queen for rook.} Qxf6 30. Qh8+ Ke7 31. Nd5+ {A little forking of my own. Which is good, since white is down a whole rook.} Kd7 32. Nxf6+ {Grab the black queen with check.} gxf6 33. Qxf6 {Snarf a pawn and now white is ahead knight for pawn, but far more importantly, he has those two passed pawns on the kingside.} Ne7 34. c3 b4 35. g7 {Black wants to win a pawn, white wants to win a knight.} bxc3 36. bxc3 Rxc3 37. Qxe7+ Kxe7 38. g8=Q {White is ahead now queen vs. rook+pawn, but now black has the most active advanced pawn. For now.} Rc2 39. Qg5+ {And there we go. Now it's all over but the legwork. } Kd7 40. Qxe3 Rxa2 41. h4 {White's goal is now two-fold. 1. Promote the h-pawn, or threaten it seriously enough that black must give up his rook to prevent it. 2. Find a way to fork the black king and rook so that white can capture the rook, then achieve the first goal unobstructed, or simply checkmate with queen+king vs. king.} a5 42. h5 Ra1+ 43. Kg2 Ra2+ 44. Kh3 {White's king defends the squares where black would like to place his rook.} Ra1 45. h6 {And now the pawn on h6 is safe after 45. ... Rh1+ because the white queen protects it.} a4 46. h7 {The pawn is still protected on h7, but black is running out of options.} Rh1+ 47. Kg2 {If now 47. ... Rxh7, white wins the rook with 48. Qa7+ K-any 49. Qxh7.} Rh5 48. Qh3+ {Black declined the pawn, but either way you slice it, white is about to win rook for pawn. This final sacrifice, 48. Qh3+!, seals the deal. It's all down hill from here. Black would have been better off simply taking the pawn, since the ensuing combination would have left his king closer to protecting his own passed a-pawn.} Rxh3 49. Kxh3 d5 50. h8=Q dxe4 51. Qxe5 {White is out of pawns, but black is about to be out of pawns and out of queens, too.} Kc6 52. Qa5 {Capturing on e4 seemed more complicated. It might have been a little more efficient, but it would allow black's king to try and nurse his last pawn to promotion on the a-file. Instead, for simpicity's sake, white simply brought the queen over to the a-file where she can kill the a-pawn, leaving the e-pawn for the white king to capture.} Kd6 53. Kg3 e3 54. Kf3 e2 55. Kxe2 {As planned.} Ke6 56. Ke3 a3 57. Ke4 Kf6 58. Qxa3 {I did the math, and white couldn't force checkmate before black could promote the pawn, so wasting a couple tempo to kill black's final pawn was necessary. And now it's just the normal king+queen vs. king endgame.} Ke6 59. Qa6+ Kf7 60. Kf5 Ke7 61. Qe6+ Kd8 62. Qf7 Kc8 63. Qa7 Kd8 64. Ke6 Kc8 65. Kd6 Kd8 66. Qd7# {Final position. This was my longest game yet on Gameknot and only my second game in over 100 games to go over 60 moves. Well played by my opponent.}
