1. f4 {the bird takes flight} d5 {sicilian response} 2. c4 {gambit surprise !} dxc4 {most of the tme i win when the gambit is accepted...} 3. e3 {defending carefully and preventing b8 knight or queen going to d4} b5 {normal reaction : defending the c4 position. Wicht is not such a good idea in my opinion because my king will go to king side anyway so pressure on queen side could be lost time} 4. Nf3 {develop and prepare castle} Bf5 {...hum...i have to keep my b1 knight and be carefull of ...Nc6 ...Nb4...Nc2+ wining the a rook. And if i whant to play b2 b3 to open the f1 bishop diagonal, i have to prevent c4 c3 with Nc3} 5. Nc3 c6 {renforcing the paw structure. This is inacurate, better to devlop king side.} 6. b3 {normal attack to free my f1 bishop and preparing attack to the king withthe a4-e8 diagonal or the a2-f7 one} b4 {ok, but my knight can go to a4 and stay there safely } 7. Na4 cxb3 {bad, i will develop my queen and threat f7} 8. Qxb3 e6 {now he has to defend and i won a tempo} 9. Bc4 {the plan was Nf d4 ...d4xf5...e6xf5 and Bxf7+! ...etc.} Bd6 10. Nd4 {continuing the plan. I supose that black prepare castle} Ne7 {now it cancel my plans and be about to castle. BIG regrets. I will do it any way d4xf5 e7xf5 e3 e4 } 11. Nxf5 Nxf5 {first castle  } 12. O-O Rg8 {i dont understand this move ??? maybe a mouse slip} 13. e4 Nd4 {not good enought, this night is not safe } 14. Qd3 Nb5 {chess and winign a pawn is coming after exchange} 15. Bxb5 cxb5 16. Qxb5+ {nice situation for white} Kf8 {i whould like to take this b4 paw and gontinuing chess and opening the center to take advantage of the discovered king situation} 17. e5 a6 {oh ! not very dangerous, i will pin the queen} 18. Qd3 {this was nearly an awfull bloody blunder ....my a4 knight saved my life against 18.qd3 Bc5+ 19.Nxc5 d8xd3 20.Nc5xd3. But i'm nt proud because i didnt anticipate it, just a lucky situation for me} Bc7 {offering quen exchange. I dont whant ! my queen is more active so it has much more value.} 19. Qf3 {threat the rook and preparing f4 f5 in way to mate on f7 (of course i know it wont happens so easily !...)} Ra7 20. f5 {continuing my plan} Qd7 {of course, expected defense} 21. Nc5 {of course, expected answer to the defense ! } Qc6 22. Qf2 {now things are becoming very tricky...with the c7 bishop on b6 i will loose my queen } Bb6 {DANGER DANGER DANGER the alarm sounds...} 23. d4 {defending the knight} exf5 24. Qxf5 {I thought i will threat a mate, forgeting the rook on a7 ! but i won a paw and open the f coon anyway } g6 {carefull with Bc6+! } 25. Qf2 Qd5 {i didnt understand this move } 26. e6 {the final attack is started} Bxc5 {gets rid of my knihght wich prevent Qxe6} 27. dxc5 {ok ok, so now ?} Qxe6 {i should play now the terrible Bc6+! winign a rook or a queen if he move the ing on e8but i forgot it, it will come after some inacurates first moves} 28. Bd2 {1 / inacurate...} a5 29. Rae1 {2 / better...} Qc6 30. Bh6+ {3 / much better !} Rg7 31. Bxg7+ Kxg7 {now i have to find the mate} 32. Qd4+ {if he plays f8 or g8 i win the b8 knight} Kh6 {but his is not much better either !} 33. Re3 {there is no solution for white, this looks as a forcet mate...} Nd7 {it wont help this knight} 34. Rh3+ {ONE ...} Kg5 {TWO ...} 35. Qh4# {THREE, here is the victory !}
