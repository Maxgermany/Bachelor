1. e4 {My oppomemt moves up his king's pawn to free his queen and kinsgide bishop...} e5 {...and I do likewise...} 2. Nf3 {...and he develops his kingside knight to attack my pawn, with the King's Knight opening...} Nc6 {...so I defend it with my queenside one, with the King's Pawn game...} 3. Nc3 {...and he moves out his queenside knight, with the Three Knights game...} Nf6 {...and I move out my kingside one, with the Four Knights game...} 4. Bc4 {...and he moves out his kingside bishop, placing it in front of his queenside knight, in conjunction with the Italian Variation...} Bc5 {...and I copy that move, keeping with symmetry...} 5. Ng5 {...and he advances his kingside knight to line up a second form of attack on my kingside bishop's pawn...} O-O {...so I castle kingside to cover it with my rook...} 6. Bxf7+ {...but he captures it with his bishop...} Rxf7 {...so I capture the bishop with my rook...} 7. Nxf7 {...which is instantly captured by the knight...} Kxf7 {...so I capture the knight with my king, for a total equal value trade of six points apiece: my pawn and rook for his bishop and knight.} 8. Qf3 {He develops his queen, pinning my kingside knight...} Nd4 {...so I move its twin to attack her...} 9. Qd3 {...forcing her to move out of the way, unpinning the knight in front of my king...} d5 {...and I now move up my queen's pawn to free her bishop, and to attack my opponent's king's pawn...} 10. f3 {...so he covers it with his kingside bishop's pawn...} dxe4 {...so I capture his pawn...} 11. fxe4 {...and he captures mine.} Ne6 {Now I retreat my knight from the 5th rank, allowing my bishop to control the squares leading to g1, and to prevent him from castling kingside...} 12. Nd5 {...and as he attacks the knight in front of my king with his...} Nxd5 {...I capture his remaining knight...} 13. exd5 {...and he captures back...} Qh4+ {...but at first I can't understand why I moved my queen to the far side to check the king here, with my remaining knight en prise...} 14. g3 {...where the obvious response was to block with the pawn that started in front of his kingside knight...} Qh3 {...and so I move my queen onto the square the pawn relinquished control of...} 15. dxe6+ {...and lose my knight...} Kxe6 {...for the pawn.} 16. Qc4+ {He attacks my king with his queen...} Kd6 {...so I move him close to my bishop...} 17. Qd3+ {...and she attacks from in front...} Ke6 {...so I move him back again...} 18. Qc4+ {...and she attacks from the previous position...} Kd6 {...so I move him back again to guard my bishop...} 19. d3 {...but this time he moves her pawn, to avoid the possibility of a threefold repetition...} Qg2 {...so I move my queen into the space the blocking pawn vacated...} 20. Rf1 {...forcing the rook to the only safe place...} Bh3 {...so the queenside bishop comes up to help her...} 21. d4 {...and he moves his queen's pawn to clear the path for the queen to cover the rook...} Bxd4 {...so my bishop captures the pawn, so mine stays close by my king for extra protection...} 22. Qd3 {...and as he keeps his queen on the diagonal covering the rook...} Qxf1+ {...I capture the rook with my queen...} 23. Qxf1 {...he captures mine with his...} Bxf1 {...I capture his with my bishop...} 24. Kxf1 {...and he captures my bishop with his king. That's why I moved my queen on the attack on move 13: to win a rook for a bishop, which is how I won that exchange, leaving me ahead by a pawn.} Rf8+ {Now I move my remaining rook onto the open f-file to take control of it, and attack the king...} 25. Kg2 {...and as he moves off the top rank...} Rf2+ {...I can advance my rook to the 7th rank to a square covered by my bishop...} 26. Kh3 {...and as he hides his king near his kingside pawns...} Rxc2 {...I can hoover up a pawn on the queenside.} 27. a4 {He advances the pawn in front of his rook...} Bxb2 {...so I capture its neighbour with my bishop, forking his bishop and rook...} 28. Ra2 {...so he moves his rook forward to place my bishop under a second form of attack...} Rxc1 {...so I capture his with my rook...} 29. Rxb2 {...and he does likewise, leaving a single-rook and pawn ending, with me having a three pawn advantage.} b6 {I move up my queenside knight's pawn to prevent the rook from advancing to my second rank...} 30. Rf2 {...so the rook moves across to the only open file with no other pieces...} Ke6 {...and I move my king across to cover the f7 square...} 31. Rf8 {...but the rook proceeds to my bottom rank...} Ra1 {...so I line up its pawn with my rook in the far right-hand corner.} 32. g4 {He moves his kingside knight's pawn...} Rxa4 {...so I complete the obliteration of his queenside pawns, leaving me with a four pawn advantage, with my extra four pawns passed.} 33. Kh4 {He moves his king towards the action...} Rf4 {...so I contest the open f-file...} 34. Re8+ {...so the rook attacks my king from behind...} Kd5 {...so I move my king up, and keep his pawn guarded...} 35. Kg5 {...and as he moves his king away from the edge of the board...} h6+ {...I move up my kingside rook's pawn to distract him...} 36. Kh4 {...so my opponent moves him back to the edge.} e4 {Now I move my king's pawn to the 5th rank, as I decide I should make my numerical advantage count...} 37. h3 {...and he advances his rook's pawn to try to put up a fight...} Kd4 {...and I move my king to help his pawn...} 38. Re7 {...and my opponent moves his rook back one rank to hoover up my pawns...} e3 {...so I advance my king's pawn to the 6th rank...} 39. Rxg7 {...and although the rook hoovers up one of my pawns...} e2 {...my king's pawn advances to the 7th rank...} 40. Rd7+ {...and although the rook checks my king from behind...} Ke3 {...my king moves behind his pawn to give it a clear run. 41. Re7+ would be followed by 41... Re4, so the rook cannot get back in time to prevent a promotion, and can also offer to exchange rooks: 42. Rxe4+ Kxe4 43. any e1=Q.} 41. Rxc7 {Although the rook hoovers up a second pawn...} e1=Q+ {...my king's pawn makes it to the 8th rank, and queens, instantly checking my opponent's king...} 42. Kh5 {...forcing him to the only safe place...} Qa5+ {...so my queen retreats to the far side to attack him again...} 43. Kxh6 {...and as he takes the bait of my kingside rook's pawn...} Rf6+ {...my rook moves back to force him towards my bottom rank...} 44. Kg7 {...and as he moves to attack my rook...} Qg5+ {...my queen moves across to help it...} 45. Kh8 {...and as he backs into my near left-hand corner...} Qh6+ {...my queen attacks him one last time...} 46. Rh7 {...and although the rook shields him from her...} Rf8# {...there's no escaping my rook, as it finishes the job for a queen and rook checkmate.}
