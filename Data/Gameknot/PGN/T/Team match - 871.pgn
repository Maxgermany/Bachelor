1. e4 {Tried and true e4.  Usually leads to a game with faster lines.} e5 {A common counter, e5.} 2. Nf3 {Nf3 attacks e5 and develops a piece.} d6 {d6 protects the e4 pawn.  I have never been very successful with this approach as it hinders the black squared bishop early in the game before it is decided where he will best fit.} 3. d4 {d4 attacks e5 a second time and is protected by the knight or queen.  Thus stengthening central control.} Nf6 {Nf6 develops a piece and attacks the e4 pawn.} 4. Nc3 {Nc3 develops a piece and protects the e4 pawns.  } Bg4 {Bg4 pins the f3 knight and develops a piece.  } 5. dxe5 {dxe5 forks the f6 knight and d6 pawn (most do not really call this a fork).} Bxf3 {Bxf3 forces either gxf3 or Qxf3 to keep material somewhat balanced.  Both will weaken white's position.  Qxf3 would reduce the pressure on the d6 pawn and gxf3 doubles pawns.} 6. gxf3 {gxf3. I decided the pressure on the d6 pawn was too much to give up at this point in the game.  Unfortunately I am sitting with 2 doubled pawns now.} Nc6 {Nc6? develops a piece and attacks e5... Hangs f6 Knight.} 7. exf6 {exf6 white is ahead in material but his position overall is weak.  Tripled pawns but I expect he will help me out with that on his move and for the material advantage gained I will take it} Qxf6 {Qxf6.  Takes my pawn and makes way for a queenside castle.} 8. Bb5 {Bb5 pins the knight.  Makes way for the kingside castle even though that would really weaken every part of my game obviously.} Be7 {Be7?  Clears way for a kingside castle} 9. Nd5 {Nd5  Forks queen, bishop and pawn.  Black cannot stop the King and Rook from being forked without losing the Queen.} Qe6 {Qe6?  However I totally did not expect this move.} 10. Nxc7+ {Nxc7  A Royal fork.} Kd7 {Kd7 Moves King out of check and attacks the knight} 11. Nxe6 {Nxe6  White now has a vast material advantage and the black king can not get out of the middle of the board} fxe6 {fxe6} 12. Bxc6+ {bxc6  Some may argue that I could have saved this atleast one move but honestly I wanted to see the reaction} bxc6 {bxc6} 13. Rg1 {Rg1 attacks the g7 pawn} Bh4 {Bh4? Pins the already immobile pawn.} 14. Rxg7+ {Rxg7  } Kd8 {Kd8 I believe black knew  his fate and chose the quickest route of loss at this point. } 15. Qxd6+ Ke8 16. Qxe6+ Kd8 17. Qd7# {White took advantage of the 2 major blunders to coast to a 17 move victory.}
