[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B15)"]

1. e4 {Team match, I am playing white.} c6 2. d4 {The Caro Kann. Haven't seen this one in a while. A solid defense for people who like draws, if I recall. I pounce on the center.} d5 3. Nc3 {All main-line moves so far.} dxe4 4. Nxe4 {The expected capture and response, still main-line.} g6 5. Bc4 {Black's common moves were 4. ... Bf5 or 4. ... Nd7 or 4. ... Nf6.  I didn't see the move as played in my reference. So, I'm off to opening principles, I guess. Develop and control the center.} e6 6. Nf3 {Ditto. I can't help but observe that white has 3 developed pieces to black's none.} Bg7 7. Bf4 {4 to 1.} Bf8 8. Neg5 {I am perplexed. I don't really understand what black was doing with 7. ... Bf8. The bishop seemed well placed, fianchettoed with an attack on d4 supported by the black queen. Maybe he wanted to play to b4? As for my response, I am thinking knights on g5 and e5 are fairly imposing (although I haven't figured out how to save them both from black's simply pushing his f7 pawn to f6 and forking them).} Bh6 9. Qd2 {Black's poor bishop must be feeling rather like a yo-yo.} Bxg5 10. Nxg5 b5 11. Bb3 {Still 4 to 0 development, but I don't see any terribly vicious attacks against black's stonewallish pawn structure.} f6 12. Nxe6 {Ahh, but now I do! I might have to give 11. ... f6? a question mark, leaving the e6 pawn to die horribly. And now black is suddenly reeling, faced with 4 white pieces about to exact a heavy price for black's slow development.} Bxe6 13. Bxe6 Qe7 14. O-O {OK, attacks are forming. I love that open e-file and the black king with nowhere to castle. Black cannot play 14. ... Qxe6?? for then he loses his queen to 15. Rae1.} Kd8 15. Qa5+ {I had wanted to play 15. Rfe1 while the black king and queen were still on the e-file, but I was 1 move too late. But here I found the way to gain a tempo and get exactly what I wanted. Black cannot play 15. .. Qf8?? to block for then he loses his queen, so he has to run back to e8, where I wanted him. I am inclined to give this move an exclamation, 15. Qa5 ! for the pure simplistic beauty of its quiet but inexorable threat.} Ke8 16. Rfe1 {I have to give this move a ! because black cannot get out of all the threats. He cannot stay where he is because white can play 17. Bxg8 which discovers the attack by the white rook on e1 that skewers the black queen to her king. Moving the queen allows white to play the same move with discovered check, gaining a piece. And moving the king allows white to play the same move with a discovered attack against the black queen, also gaining a piece.} Kf8 17. Bxg8 {As it turns out, black's queen has only one space, 17. ... Qd7 to which she can run, in which case white's bishop escapes, perhaps to e6 with an attack on the harried black queen. Black might try to diffuse the situation with 17. ... Qxe1 , 18. Rxe1 Rxg8, though white would meet that with 19. Qd8  Kg7 20. Qe7  Kh8 21. Qb7 Na6 22. Re7 and mate to follow. } Qg7 18. Qd8# {Black chose poorly. As it is, the move played must receive three ???, for white's response is instant victory. It's an odd position. The white bishop on g8 is attacked by 3 pieces and defended by none. And yet, it is perfectly safe and even better, it blocks black's escape to c7, thus allowing the white queen to achieve the mate. Rarely have I seen a piece in such a dire predicament play such an important role in a mating position.}
