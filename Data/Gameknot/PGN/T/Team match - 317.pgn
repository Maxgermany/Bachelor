[Opening "Queen's pawn game (E00)"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Black develops the King's knight to deter e4 and indirectly contest the center.} 2. c4 {Generally agreed to be the most assertive move for White, c4 contests the vacant d5 from the wing and infers a plan to develop the knight behind it to support a potential e4.} e6 {Pushing the pawn out one square to resume control over d5 and freeing the King's bishop. The plan is to play either the Nimzo-Indian (3.Nc3) or transpose to the Benoni (3.Nf3 where the f-pawn is blocked - of course, the QID is also possible).} 3. a3 {?! A somewhat dubious move. White is obviously anticipating and looking to prevent the Bb4 pin, but this allows Black to equalise easily. Developing either knight was the stronger option. } c5 {Punching back in the center, asking White to decide upon a plan for his center. (A benoni-type position is still possible with 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 but Black is gaining control over the initiative, if 4.dxc5 then 4...Bxc4 and Black can be quite pleased with the position, and if 4.Nf3 then 4...cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nc6 and Black can still be content.) } 4. e3 {White instead opts to play e3 to open the bishop and reinforce the d-pawn, although with c5 already on the board the exchange will give up the central e-pawn.} cxd4 {Exchanging the wing pawn to gain the stronger core center and the semi-open c-file to fight through.} 5. exd4 {The stronger way to gain back on material (If 5.Qxd4? then 5...Nc6 and Black is quite far ahead in development), but White's central pawn position is now potentially susceptible to exchange and isolation through a supported and well-timed d5 thrust.} Be7 {We know the bishop is going here - it's the only square available (or that doesn't block a central pawn advance), we're looking to castle kingside, and it's a decent square to "support the support" (and if the Knight on f6 moves, can always shift to f6 where it nicely controls the center and hits some weak pawns/squares).} 6. Nc3 {These next few moves are quite natural development - Nc3 to develop the Queen's knight to increase control in the center, castling, and Bd3 to get the bishop to an open diagonal and allow for castling.} O-O 7. Bd3 b6 {At this point, the d5 thrust was certainly viable but I felt no rush to play it and instead waited to first set up the queenside fianchetto with the bishop cutting down the open diagonal to the kingside.} 8. h3 {?! I'm calling this one dubious as there were no threats prevented and no gains made that I can see - it only serves to delay finishing development. Nf3 was the best move. (8.Nf3 Bb7 9.O-O d5 10.cxd5 Nxd5)} Bb7 9. Nf3 d5 {And now I felt the timing was right to begin the attack with the d5 thrust, expecting to isolate the pawn. } 10. O-O {White castles as it is imperitive to get the King to safety when things are opening up. If instead 10.cxd5 Nxd5, or if 10.c5 bxc5 11.dxc5 Bxc5/Nbd7 and possibly 12.b4 for nice complications for both sides.} dxc4 {The Queen's pawn has now been isolated to provide a target to play against. I'm quite content with Black's position here - open c-file and semi-open d-file to the isolani for the rooks, the bishops cutting out through those open files, no major pawn weaknesses, and no major concession to the center. The Queen's knight is obviously not developed (yet), but there was no rush as it could operate effectively from a few squares in these types of positions - of course with an isolated pawn on d4, Nc6 will be best now.} 11. Bxc4 {White captures to even up material.} Nc6 {Not where I normally like the play the knight with the queenside fianchetto, but the short term plan is to grab the open lines and load up on and win the isolated pawn, which is pretty much already fixed by e6 (eg 12.d5 Na5 13.Bd3 Nxd5).} 12. Be3 {White develops his bishop to defend the pawn (currently at two attackers, three defenders).} Rc8 {Grabbing the open file and creating the threat of a discovered attack on the (currently) hanging bishop.} 13. Bd3 {White retreats the bishop to a fairly strong square that can battery up in front of a Queen on c2 hitting h7 in case the King's knight moves, however it cuts the communication with one of the isolani's defenders.} Nd5 {Although this leaves the position open to the somewhat ugly looking 14.Qc2 g6 15.Bh6 Re8, Nd5 results in a nicely centralised knight blockading the isolani (and hitting the supporting bishop) with a line for the dark squared bishop to attack it from f6. } 14. Nxd5 {Fortunately my opponent decides to exchange which allows for continuation of pressuring d4.} Qxd5 {Now, both the Queen and the rook will be able to attack the pawn (currently at two attackers and two defenders), and the rooks are connected, but one must be wary as not many squares are safe for the Queen other than retreat down the d-file.} 15. b4 {White pushes to gain some elbow room on the queenside, taking a5 as a possibility from Black's knight and perhaps intending a future b5.} Rfd8 {Continuing with the plan - the isolani now has three attackers and two defenders.} 16. Be2 {White retreats the bishop to connect the Queen to the pawn to rebalance the equation.} Bf6 {And with Bf6 we have tipped it in our favour as White has run out of defenders.} 17. Qa4 {White gives up on the pawn and instead looks to generate some counterplay against the a-pawn which will hang, but the Queen is unable to immediately follow through (for example 17...Nxd4 18.Qxa7 Nxe2+ 19.Kh1 and the winning Qxf3 which leads to mate or netting the white lady, a little further into the exhange line with the isolani and she becomes trapped 17...Nxd4 18.Bxd4 Bxd4 19.Qxa7 Ra8).} Nxd4 {With the balance in our favour, we follow through with the attack and exchanges. Note how we get the nice Queen bishop battery along the a8-h1 diagonal.} 18. Bxd4 Bxd4 19. Rad1 {A nice move, taking up opposition on the open file and pinning Black's queen, however the Queen and Bishop are easily protected by the supported e5.} e5 20. Nh4 {White repositions the knight (while protecting the g2 mating threat from Queen and Bishop that he just opened - eg. 20.Nxd4 Qxg2#) but I'm not certain what he was planning here.} Bc6 {Attacking the Queen - after 21.Qxa7 Rd7 22.Qa6 Ra8 23.Qc4 Qxc4 24.Bxc4 Rxa3 Black has successfully traded down.} 21. b5 {White however looks to counter with the pawn, however Black has a powerful response...} Qe4 {With Qe4 we accomplish quite a few things - we hit the hanging knight and the hanging bishop, but also with the threat of if 22.bxc6 then Bxf2+ opens an attack on and wins the hanging Queen.} 22. Bc4 {A nice move cutting the line between the Queens after the potential Bxf2+} Bd5 {So, we attack that blocked line with bishop and rook while protecting our threatened bishop (if Bxd5 then it re-opens).} 23. Nf3 {White retreats the hanging knight to a stronger defensive post striking into the center occupied by Black.} Rxc4 {With two attackers on the bishop defended once by the Queen we win a piece and attack the Queen at the same time.} 24. Qxa7 {White gains back the pawn, creating potential threats along the back rank.} Qg6 {With Qg6 we pin White's g-pawn threatening to win the Knight on f3, with a good bit of firepower bearing in on the King.} 25. Qe7 {The White Lady threatens the undefended rook, but with open lines and communication channels we mitigate the threat through Rdc8. Also possible was Ra8 threatening to win another pawn.} Rdc8 26. Nh4 {White Knight again to h4, looking for to make the Queen dance.} Qh5 {Ducking away and preventing the Knight from going anywhere else (Knight to g6, f5, or f3 lose it).} 27. g4 {White weakens up the King's castle which is extremely dangerous with two bishops bearing down upon it, looking to kick the Queen again.  However, with Qh6 there is no follow through (eg. 28.g5 Qxh4 or 28.Nf5 Qxh3).} Qh6 {Additionally, on h6 we end up with three heavy pieces converging on c1 which has only the two rooks in defense along the back. In addition, we have a check available with Bxf2+ as a potential move to draw out a defender.} 28. Rd3 {I suspect White was looking at a lift to enable the rook to f3, but the game is now won for White with a pretty combination.} Rc4c1 {Of course, quite a few threats exist on the board... for example:  If 29.Rxc1 then Rxc1+ 30.Kh2 Qf4+ 31.Rg3 Rh1#.  If 29.Rf3 then Bxf2+ 30.Kxf2 Rxf1+ 31.Kxf1 Qc1+ 32.Kg2 Rc2+ 33.Kg3 Qe1+ 34.Rf2 Qxf2#} 29. Rdd1 {White retreats back, hoping to dampen down the firepower, however with Bxf2+ we effectively draw out the guard to win the exchange.} Bxf2+ 30. Rxf2 Rxd1+ {And White resigned. Possible followups include 31.Rf1 Rxf1+ 32.Kxf1 Qc1+ 33.Kf2 Qd2+ and then mate, or 31.Kh2 Rh1+ 32.Kg3 Rc3+ 33.Rf3 Qf4+ and then mate.}
