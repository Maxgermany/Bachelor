1. d4 {QP openings are more geared towards long positional games than quickies. Every now and again, though...} Nf6 {Preparing for an Indian defense.} 2. c4 {The usual move...} e5 {Hanauer decides to gamble with the Budapest Gambit.} 3. d5 {Arnold tries to seize space by declining the Pawn.} Bc5 {The problem with Arnold's 3rd move is it relinquished control of this square. Hanauer already has a significant advantage in development.} 4. Bg5 {Trying to gain time by means of a pin. However, Arnold has overlooked a tactical finesse.} Ne4 {Thunderbolt from heaven! Arnold loses his game-sense and reacts without thinking.} 5. Bxd8 {The hand is quicker than the mind. Arnold played this move without seeing...} Bxf2# {...this. End of game, and they've barely sat down!}
