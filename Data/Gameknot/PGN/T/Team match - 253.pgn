[Opening "Caro-Kann (B13), exchange, Rubinstein variation"]

1. e4 {darknite13 is using the best open in my mind, e4.  D4 is another I respect.  All others are modified around these two opens unless it is the Bird's Eye Open.  The English Open is the White Sicilian to me and I know the Sicilian as Black and when White goes on a Defense I take advantage.  I like the Caro against e4 and usually go this route.  } c6 {My favorite against e4, Caro-Kann Defense.  } 2. d4 {The conventional response for white....} d5 {The conventional for Caro.  } 3. exd5 {Predicted. } cxd5 {Predicted conventional. } 4. Nc3 {This is one of many of white's opportunities at this point.  The Caro is able to respond, usually with...} e6 {...opening Black Bishop as well as developing defense.  } 5. Bd3 {I've seen this many many times and trying to comment seems redundant to the Caro Kann Defense strategy.  The bottom line is grand masters use the Caro to date with acceptable success.  It is a defense for Black for Black to know what to do without the long and numerous moves in a Sicilian or the weak Ruy Lopez.  I rest the case to say my favorite defense as Black against e4 is the Caro Kann.  I have left the Sicilian and I had left the weak Ruy Lopez back in the 1980s.  To date the best defense against e4 open is Caro Kann.  Or, maybe, Alekhine's Defense! I've not lost faith with Alekhine to date! My records show it! } Nc6 6. Nge2 Nf6 7. Bf4 Bd6 8. Bxd6 Qxd6 9. Nb5 Qe7 {Fairly standard and equal for white dealing with Caro.  } 10. O-O a6 {I wanted the white knight out of there by my own pressure and decision before castling.   } 11. Nbc3 O-O 12. Qd2 h6 {The "cup formation" usual with a Caro where the four king side pawns "cup" the area above the king to defend and restrict untoward advances from white.  } 13. Qf4 {Perhaps the white queen moved too early ahead of reinforcements or perhaps white is being aggressive with the queen.  In any case I have already set up an adequate Caro Defense and I can advance a knight....} Nb4 {....advanced. } 14. Rad1 Bd7 {This is the time to develop my rear bishop even to rank two which is the only place for it.  However, a tight formation is crucial in either Sicilian or Caro to e4 as an off set to the dull Ruy Lopez many choose against e4.  I gave up on the Ruy Lopez back in the 1960's while playing against my dad and he'd always use the King's Gambit on me to my disgrace.  To date I do the same with anyone doing e5 to my open e4.  } 15. a3 {White wants to kick my knight out...} Nxd3 {...so instead of retreating him into a tight formation in development that does not need him I trade it. } 16. Rxd3 {Rooks are always kind of slow in the opening.  They are heavy artillery and they need to have time to set up fire missions.  } Rac8 {It is a general rule to put a rook into an open field of fire instead of leaving it in a corner.  Especially if the field of fire can take out a position undefended (like the white c2 pawn).    } 17. Rfd1 Rc4 {I can also use my rook to advance like the 105 Howitzers in the Army Field Artillery (LIGHT).  When a rook can move forward it is the same as a Battery Battalion advancing canons to the forefront to cut deep behind enemy lines.  If a Battery Position can move ahead of Infantry (pawns or soldiers) to support Infantry then it is a better decision than sending the pawns forward to be bullet catchers.  } 18. Qe5 {The queen is the most powerful piece on the board but when she is constricted by less valued Material she is just in a dodge ball ring trying to get out of the way of the dodge ball coming after her.  So.....} Ng4 {I attack the most valuable piece on the board that is now in the center of a ring of fire.  } 19. Qg3 Nf6 20. Qh4 {White has a queen dodging balls and a rook ready for the event I make a fatal mistake.  } Kh7 {I put my King into the defense though he is always the target.  I put him where he can move more freely to make white work hard to get him. } 21. Re3 b6 {White is probing for an attack and while doing so push with the safest move for now.  I am already set up to defend and I am defending and that is what Black has to do always.  } 22. Qf4 {More probing around by white to get into my target (King) but it is just a probe again to see if I will do something stupid. } Kg8 {Best place for the king to return in the midst of the probing by white to try and crack my defense.  } 23. Rdd3 {Another heavy coming to the arena of the dodge ball circle but it takes time for the heavies to really get into position in a tightly formed arena. } Rfc8 {I loosen up the rook to tie with a rook and give more space to my king while white tries to get his heavy material into the attack in the dodge ball circle.  The cup formation and the Caro is one of my favorite formations against attack. It is good to defend and it is also good to attack at the right moment....} 24. Re5 Rc8c7 25. Rg3 Kh8 26. Qh4 Ng8 {You can see how clinging to the Caro can mean extreme pressure at this point.  Here I know I get to go through the tunnel to see what comes.  I do get scared at points like this because the Caro does not always protect with economy of motion even though it is designed to have economy of motion (force) at most given times.   } 27. Qg4 Qf8 {Time to make a tighter formation against the barrage that is obviously coming from white....} 28. b3 Rc4c6 {White wants to kick out my rook and I have the place for him.  Perhaps white is going to the other side to try and constrain my movements.  } 29. b4 {Now white is on my right side as black and doing just what I thought....} Rc6c4 {My rook just goes right back into forward position. } 30. Qf4 {I see white is indecisive at this point.  I can reposition my pieces according to the anticipated avenue of approach by white and simply just draw the game with repetitive moves and I am willing to do so.  I am not in a position to attack without paying attention to what white is trying to do...} Ne7 {Even a rook (or a couple of rooks) with a queen need to synchronize to get something done. My knight is the piece to use right now to see how long this repetition and hesitation from white will last. } 31. Rh5 f6 32. Kh1 Rc7c8 33. Qd6 Qd8 34. Re3 Rc8c6 35. Qf4 Nf5 36. Reh3 e5 37. Qc1 {If white won't make a decision to attack I will...} exd4 38. g4 dxc3 39. gxf5 Qf8 40. Nf4 Kg8 41. Qg1 Rxf4 42. Rh5xh6 Bxf5 43. Rh6h8+ Kf7 44. Rxf8+ Kxf8 45. Rh8+ Kf7 46. f3 Rxf3 47. Qg2 Re6 48. Qxf3 {And now a brilliancy move two punch anticipated.  Never just trade away when other material is to be pinned and gotten.  } Be4 {Thusly....} 49. Kg2 Re8 50. Rxe8 Kxe8 51. Kf2 {He's gonna lose his queen but not before the one two punch! } Bxf3 52. Kxf3 {I figured white should resign now but your opponent has every right in the world to continue and make the best of it.  } Ke7 53. Ke3 f5 54. Kd4 Ke6 55. Kxc3 Ke5 56. Kd3 {The game ends by resignation.  It took some time for white to resign but on the other hand white was as resilient as I was in the tight trapped contained environment the Caro Kann does to offer a reasonable and flexible defense against e4. }
