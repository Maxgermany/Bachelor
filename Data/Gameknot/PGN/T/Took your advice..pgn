1. e4 {So here is a game against hughlews where i play rather bad at the beginning but manage to mate my opponent at the with an overwhelming attack. Enjoy.} c5 {My usual response to e4} 2. Bc4 d6 3. Qf3 {this was a rather surprising move indeed, considering the mate can be defended easily, and then maybe the queen coming out early could be punished.} Nf6 {decided to develop my knight while at the same time defending against a mate, but also my knight is pinned now.} 4. h3 g6 5. d3 {This move IMO was rather passive. Perhaps Nc3 was better.} Bg7 6. Nc3 O-O {unpinning my knight now.} 7. Bg5 {Here i started to feel a bit uncomfortable with the pressure on my king side.} Na6 {Heading to c7.} 8. Nd5 {Since my knight was unpinned, i was able to take whites knight.} Nxd5 9. Bxd5 Nc7 {A nice square for the knight for now. It defends many good squares.} 10. Bc4 b5 11. Bd5 {attacking my rook here so i got a chance to get whites lsb while doubling his pawns.} Nxd5 12. exd5 Bb7 13. O-O-O c4 14. dxc4 bxc4 15. Qe3 a5 {Here i don't know what i was thinking, i did not pay any attention to the pressure on e7. Gladly i got out of the fork and everything went better than expected.} 16. Bxe7 Qb8 17. Qf4 {Here white probably could have taken the rook. Not sure why he didn't.} Be5 {chasing the queen here} 18. Qxc4 Re8 {I probably could have played bxd5, not sure though if there was a mating net if 19qxd5  qxb2+} 19. Bg5 Qa7 20. Nf3 Rac8 {here i keep adding pressure on whites king.} 21. Qh4 Qc5 {threatening mate on c2} 22. c3 {Logical response, but allows this at least decent move.} Bxc3 23. Kb1 {Maybe white could have taken and gotten out of it. I did not see any mates if 23.bxc3 but a drawing Chance for black perhaps.} Qb5 {threatening mate again whilst pinning the pawn also.} 24. Bc1 {Only move really.} Bxd5 25. Ng5 {This was where i started suspect my capability to win this game, but after a while of thinking i came to a conclusion that whites attack is not dangerous} Re2 {Threats keep on going} 26. Qxh7+ Kf8 {Only move} 27. Qh6+ Ke7 28. Rxd5 {And this is where white blunders. Its a forced mate here} Rxb2+ 29. Bxb2 Qxb2# {And here i finished the game with a conditional move, as i was told by Archduke piccolo on my last annotation, where i was annoyed that everyone always resigns. Hope you enjoyed.}
