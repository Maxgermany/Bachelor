[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {This game is more or less focuses on the d7 square, and a pin on Black's knight on that square which I held since move 9. If I had dedicated myself more to the attack on the square on d7, I may have had a pretty strong attack...} d5 {King's pawn opening - I deviate from my normal pattern of the English Opening (I wanted a solid position given the rating difference of me and david1223} 2. Nf3 Nf6 {a symmetrical position so far} 3. Nc3 {bringing out knight #2 and threatening the d5 square} e6 {I remember another annotated game where a knight sacrifice on taking that e6 pawn led to White decimating Black (but that was with the Queen's pawn opening... I may be wrong on this, but I can't remember what the game was, it was awhile ago)} 4. Bg5 {I like to play moves like this when I am in doubt of what else to do} Nbd7 {brings out the other knight, and that knight stays there for the rest of the game} 5. Qd2 {Black takes advantage of this move later in the game, but for now this seems like a good move - it opens up castling opportunities and allows a rook-and-queen formation on the d-file when I do castle (I considered Qd3 but felt that Qd2 was safer)} c5 {challenging the center - if I retake White's center control is weakened considerably} 6. e3 {this is where I see a chance to pin the knight at d7, and focus on that, but after that I pretty much forget the idea of castling} h6 7. Bh4 {keeping the pressure on that knight} cxd4 8. exd4 {pawn trade} Be7 {I was expecting g5 here... I should have taken that knight straight away, but I don't realise the significance of this move until it was too late} 9. Bb5 {the pin I mentioned at the beginning} a6 {chasing my bishop...} 10. Ba4 {retreating my bishop..} b5 {I was expecting this, and then I saw a possible move that could give me the advantage. Was I right? } 11. Nxb5 {? No, I wasn't - this move drops me down a piece due to the position of my queen - any other situation and this move would have been great. I saw this as a gambit that was beneficial for White - for the sake of just one point, White could maintain the pin on the h7 knight and create passed pawns on my a and b file (of course, White could simply break the pin by castling, but then I'd just opt for the exchange - the less pieces stopping my pawns, the better)} axb5 12. Bxb5 Ne4 {(!) ouch! This move guarantees Black a piece advantage } 13. Qd3 {maybe Bxe7 would have been better - Black would still be a piece up, but it'd clear the queenside up more for my pawns} Bxh4 14. Nxh4 {?? I call this my losing move - I should have pressured d7 with Nf5...} Qxh4 {now the queen's in a dangerous spot!} 15. Bc6 {? I admit, I was panicking a little here - I felt the d7 knight pin was the only thing I had going for me here...} Qxf2+ {I completely overlooked this!} 16. Kd1 Ba6 17. Qa3 {?? And I overlooked something else here - Be2+! wins my queen. I didn't realise this until after I made this move, and once I spotted it, I resigned. I'm just curious as to whether me putting pressure on the f7 knight was the right course of action for this particular game}
