1. Nf3 {I often play Tag (our team Cap'n) under the ruse that I have some superior skill level.  Troop on our team suggested a rule #7 to improve your rating by playing Cap'n Tag, so I invoked the rule.  I don't really believe it, but  is fun to get in his head like this.} d5 {Tag opens with nf3, an opening i don't particularly like , I ignore this move (as I do many moves I shouldn't ignore) and just push to d5} 2. c4 {he opens his queenside and attacks, I don't like the trade here} d4 {so I push} 3. d3 {he opens up the black bishop for some reason,  the king side seems real srtong and I have no pieces developed.} c5 {I really don't like my pawn hanging out there by itself in the middle.  the only support would seem to overdevelop the queen .} 4. g3 {ok,  so now he starts to develop the white bishop it would appear,  I still have nothing going} Nc6 {I don't like the idea of him going Bg2 and basically freezing my white bishop so I defend by blocking with the knight, I still don't like the lack of development on my king side.  } 5. Bg2 {he does the anticipated move, maybe giving me a slight chance to recapture some tempo (whatever the f*** that is)} e5 {I thought about Nf6 but wanted to open up my black bishop towards the middle, maybe not the best move, but I did it anyway} 6. Bg5 {Wow, this comes as a total surprise.....} Be7 {not exactly the way I wanted to clear out my kingside castle, but I hate the fact that he has his bishop there.} 7. Bxe7 {we swap} Ngxe7 {I take with the N to make it possible for me to castle} 8. Nbd2 {I don't know what he is doing so ... I figure I will do something stupid I guess} Be6 {I really should have castled then I think. but my kingside is now strong} 9. O-O {he finally castles} h6 {I didn't want him to Ng5 to attack my bishop, so I pushed here istead of castling} 10. Nh4 {to me,  this was a weird time for him to do this,  I really didn't give a rip about the bishop for Knight swap, so I FINALLY castle} O-O {whew  safe at last.} 11. Bxc6 {so he gets me stacking pawns} bxc6 {I really don't care,  I may regret this later } 12. Ng2 {one day he may explaing this too me,  but I  don't think if I ask now, he would answer} Ng6 {so I put my knight wehre I wanted to (actually my second choice)} 13. Ne4 {now he is attacking my weak pawn,  anticipated} Qe7 {but I still don't like my queen having such a defensive role} 14. e3 {he applies some presure to stack another set of pawns.} Bf5 {I don't see any advantage to stacking more pawns, so I try to go for a swap to get the pressure off my weak side} 15. Qa4 {ARRRGHHH.  now I am weak all over.....} Bxe4 {I alleviate some of the pressure,  I can't overlaod the queen} 16. dxe4 {now he has stacked pawns  but on the king side.  I am thinking he is not as bad off as I} Qd6 {so I do the only thing I know here.} 17. a3 {Ok,  so he wants to play on my weak side... } Rfb8 {I bring in more support,  I don't want to give up any more pawns.  I thought about a5 and decided against it.} 18. Rab1 {hmmmm  too much heat here.....} a5 {I ahve no choice but a5} 19. f4 {now I am like,,,  e5xf4, e3 xf4...  and his pawns are no longer stacked.  I look for a move,  any move but that.......} Ne7 {i know have a bit of freedom with my queen....} 20. Rfd1 {he decides to load up here.....} Nc8 {I am thinkinig I need to get his queen off my weak side...  I don't know any other way to do it... ssoooooo} 21. Kf2 {I couldn't figure out this move,,,  I couldn't take his pawn anyway,  my queen would be exposed...} Nb6 {i decide to push his queen around} 22. Qc2 {so I get my queen out of the way.} Qe6 {I now have a couple of pawns on my d4 for support and have remove the attack on my weak side.    I think.........} 23. b3 {This is another chance for me to get the momentum,  ....i mean  yeah  he had to support his pawn at c4.....} Qh3 {I'm thinking  I might can push something around here.  maybe expose soemthing....  nmaybe get his rook out of the middle of the board} 24. exd4 {he takes instead....  this is a great chance for me to unstack my pawns.....} cxd4 {so I do knowing that he will probably go up a pawn in the process though...} 25. fxe5 {he does,  I am thinking my only upside here is that his King is slightly exposed.  I ahve to figure out a way to make that work for me.} Qe6 {first things first.  I can't take h2,  that is a death trap, I go ahead and bring the queen to safety also thinking I may get the pawn back.} 26. Rxd4 {so he is up two pawns  ....} Qxe5 {one actually......} 27. Qd3 {it looks like he is loading up to come straight down the middle  and why not,,,  I would} Qf6+ {I decide I might can push his kiing around, get it somewehre bad,  or maybe he will block with hsi knight and I can  get that.....} 28. Ke3 {so he moves to teh center of the board...  hmmm  interesting..  what can i do here?} Qg5+ {nothing obvious comes to mind.  I want to get the middle back and keep him from having move initiative.} 29. Ke2 {he retreats,    Damn  I seem to have gotten a lot of free moves but I can't do anything with it.} Rbd8 {but...  since I have the d8 support.......} 30. Rd1 {he loads up the middle,  I count the pieces......} Rxd4 {well  a swap... his king is partially exposed,,,  I ahve a place to hide my king...  so I take a swap here..  I can't think with so many pieces anyway.} 31. Qxd4 {swap done....} c5 {I didn't want any more pawns coming down the middle...  and this looked like a fun move....} 32. Qe3 {he offers a swap...  how does that help me?????} Qe5 {it doesn't   he gets to develop the knight if I do...} 33. Rd2 {he anticipates Qb2 I guess which would ahve won me the pawn at a3....} a4 {I decide I can get him in a fork here....  his king is still without a lot of cover so i am likeing my options....} 34. Kf3 {I really thought he would have gone Nf4 here to keep me from putting him in check at Qh5.....I am sure he had a reason....} axb3 {I go ahead and tak the pawn  hoping to get his queen off base a little...  I am figureing on moving my knight to get it in the fray.  } 35. Qxb3 {he takes as anticipated...} Qf6+ {I don't have a good place to put the knight right now.  so I stall by putting him in check.  I thought about Qh5 , but I wanted to shove the king to the middle, which is where I want to attack} 36. Ke3 {he pushes it toward the middle, but I didn't think of that ,  it limits his knights mobility which has been suffering the whole game. (move 12) I looke at this a while, focusing on the knight rook and king fork if I take c4...I think about putting presssure on c4  either with my  queen or ra4....} Rxa3 {I realize I don't have to...   I bet Tag is pissed now...  I got my pawn back  :-)}
