1. f4 {Bird's opening. I use it myself sometimes.} d5 2. d4 {Not the best move. the main lines here are 2.g3 and 2.e3 (2.b3 is similar to 1.b3 openenig).} b6 {What's the point? The bishop can move freely on the c8-h3 diagonal, why weakening the queen-side?} 3. e3 Nf6 4. Nc3 {4.c3 would give white the stonewall position (like black plays in the dutch opening).} c6 5. Nf3 Bg4 {now we can see that b6 was not in place. instead black could already play Nbd7 or e6.} 6. Be2 Ne4 {one coukd not attack with only two pieces.} 7. Nd2 {7. 0-0 is better. there is no real threat from the black side.} Bxe2 {It is better to take first on c3 - making doubled pawns for white.} 8. Nxe2 e6 9. O-O c5 {Black is not yet castked and its kind of dangerous to open the center now.} 10. Nxe4 {10. c3 is a good option too.} dxe4 11. Ng3 f5 {black has a big problem. on the queen-side he is exposed in the white squares with no white squares bishop. in the center all his pawns are on the white squares with no real defense.} 12. b3 {yes, the bishop's place is indeed b2.} g5 {???? the king is exposed with no defense and black is helping white to take the a1-h8 diagonal easy.} 13. Bb2 {13. Qh5+!} Bg7 14. Qh5+ Kf8 15. fxg5 {black is lost. there is no escape for the king.} Nc6 16. Rad1 Rg8 {16... Qe7 is needed.} 17. Qxh7 {17. dxc5! Qe7 18. Bf6 Bxf6 19. gxf6 Qxf6 20. Nxe4! Qg7 21. g3 bxc5 22. Nxc5 Qf7 23. Qh6+ Ke8 24.Qxe6+ Qxe6 25. Nxe6 +-} Qxg5 18. Nxe4 Qg4 19. h3 {why giving up the Knight?} Qxe4 20. dxc5 {and why giving up the bishop too?} Qxe3+ 21. Kh1 Bxb2 22. Rd7 {it seems that white has a great attack. I'm not sure of it.} Bg7 {a must.} 23. Rxf5+ Ke8 {23... exf5 24. Qxf5 Ke8 25. Qf7#} 24. Rxg7 {white gains a piece back.} Rxg7 25. Qh8+ Kd7 26. Qxg7+ Ne7 27. Rf3 Qc1+ 28. Kh2 Qxc2 29. Qd4+ {is it realy lost? 29... Kc7 30. Qd6+ Kc7 (30... Kc8 31. Qxe7 and mates the next move) 31. Qd7+ Ka6 32. b4 Qxa2 (32... Nc6 33. Ra3+ Na5 34. Rxa5+ bxa5 35. Qc6#) 33. c6 Qd5 (33...Nf5 34. Qd3#) 34. Qb7+ Kb5 35. Qxa8 +-. 29... Nd5 30. Rf7+ Kc6 31. Qa4+ Kxc5 32. b4+ Nxb4 33. Rc7+ +-. I guess it is lost...}
