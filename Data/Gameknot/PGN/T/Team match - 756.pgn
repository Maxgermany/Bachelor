1. e4 c5 2. d3 {I don't like these closed versions.} Nc6 3. c3 e6 4. Nf3 d5 {black easy equalize and get a good grip in the center.} 5. e5 f6 {pressing e5.} 6. Bf4 d4 {of course. preventing white from playing d4 and by that isolating e5.} 7. Be2 h6 8. c4 fxe5 9. Nxe5 Nxe5 10. Bxe5 Nf6 {white has a problem with his Knight and his q-side Rook.} 11. h3 Bd6 12. Bxd6 Qxd6 {black has a strong center. white's d3 pawn is weak and left behind.} 13. O-O e5 {maybe 13... 0-0 was better. the f file seems to be important for black.} 14. Bh5+ Kd8 15. Bg6 {now black has a problem with the king in center and the rook cant go to e8.} Bd7 16. a4 Be8 {there is no choice but to exchange bishops.} 17. Bxe8 Rxe8 {by exchanging the bishops black got the e file.} 18. f3 {18. nd2 is a must. by playing f3 the black knught will go to g3 or f4.} Nh5 19. Kf2 Qg6 20. g4 Nf4 {did I say that d3 is weak already?} 21. Ra3 Rf8 22. Kg3 {a must. the king is poorly placed on f2.} Nh5+ 23. Kh2 Nf4 24. h4 {?? why not going back with the king to g3?} h5 25. Kg3 hxg4 {white's king side is falling apart.} 26. fxg4 Nh5+ 27. Kh3 Rxf1 28. Qxf1 Nf4+ 29. Kg3 Kc7 {right! getting the rook to the action zone.} 30. Rb3 Rf8 31. Nd2 Nh5+ {a queen up. nothing to see here no more.} 32. Kh3 Rxf1 33. Nxf1 Nf4+ 34. Kg3 Ne2+ 35. Kf3 Nc1 36. Ra3 Qf6+ 37. Kg2 Qxh4 38. Nh2 Qe1 39. Ra1 Qd2+ 40. Kg1 Qxb2 41. Rxc1 Qxc1+ 42. Nf1 Qc3 {the end...}
