1. e4 {a brilliant example of the kamshaft mate  } Nf6 {i attack pawn } 2. Bb5 {he ignores it} Nxe4 {i take} 3. Nf3 {opens knight} e5 {pawn sacrifice} 4. Nxe5 Qf6 {q f6 might have benn better but in that situation he could defend the knight, if he tried that now i could mate him } 5. Ng4 {this was a brilliant move, simultaneously stopping me from taking the knight and stopping mate } Qf5 {i move my queen forward so his knight can't move or its mate} 6. Ne3 {that isn't such a good move} Qxf2# {this is what i call the kamshaft mate, like scholars mate but with a knight, also it gets the queen out, but like the scholars mate it is quite obvious and easily stopped }
