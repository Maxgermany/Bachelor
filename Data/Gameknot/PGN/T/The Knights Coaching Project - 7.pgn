1. e4 {This was my worst game so far.  White easily developes and keeps his king safe while black concentrates on a futile effort to develop his dark squared bishop ignoring king safety.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 {The starting position.  Black has one square to move his king d7} 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ {White wins the knight compensating for the loss of the Queen.} Kc6 {I wonder if Kc7 was better?} 9. Bxg4 Qc7 {Im trying to get my queen into play and overlook that he can easily defend the pawn with g3 or better 0-0!} 10. O-O g6 {This was a terrible mistake and a waste of time.  The whole game is centered on my getting my bishop developed.} 11. Ne6 {He could just take my bishop if he wanted to but he has other plans} Qd6 12. Nc3 {White gets good development here.  Now he has his bishop and two knights going after my King} a6 {another wasted pawn move because I was worried more about losing my queen than my king!!!} 13. Nxe4 Qd5 {another major blunder.  somehow i think i can win one of his knights with h5?  He can easily protect his e4 knight with d3! developing his dark squared bishop.  Instead he moves Ne4xc5 then after i move he can move Bf3 pinning my Queen to my King.} 14. Ne4xc5 Qd6 {My only move to save my Queen} 15. d3 Bg7 {another blunder because I assume NxB then QxN} 16. c3 Rg8 {Now i have to make the wasted rook move to protect my bishop} 17. Bf3+ Kb6 {My king is not safe here either as white mates in four moves} 18. Be3 Ka5 {The only safe square but not for long} 19. a4 b5 {Throwing up a prayer here} 20. b4+ Kb6 {mate on the next move} 21. Nd7# {I got thrashed!}
