1. e4 {Annotated for mrmarmalade.. so I'm staying on white's perspective mainly.. Arrr! } e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 Bc5 4. h3 {A rather passive move... Ng4 is not a threat just yet, because the queen can pick it off. Maybe you were worried of something like ... d5 and Ng4? But a naturally developing move such as 4. Nf3 would be much better. 4..d5 5. exd5 Ng4 6. o-o and white has a small advantage.  Maybe h3 would be a good move to make in a few moves, if black threatened Bg4, but here it seems premature, and passive.} Nc6 5. Nf3 {Yay for developement!} h6 6. Qe2 {Not sure what the purpose of this move is exactly. Dreams of castling long? Plans of Be3? Either of those two ideas aren't the main priority just yet, as you still have pieces sitting on the queenside begging to be developed, and a king aching to castle *short*. I like 6. o-o. 6. Nc3, or maybe even 6. Be3 here.} d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. Nxe5 O-O 9. Bxd5 {Your white bishop is much better than his knight on the open board! This is trading a good bishop for a decent knight, and centralizing the black queen. Also your knight will now be attacked twice, so you'll have to move it to f3. (Black has initiative)  9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. o-o leaves white with a small advantage due to black's pawn weakness.} Qxd5 10. Nf3 Bd7 11. O-O Qd6 12. Nc3 Qg6 13. Qe4 {I like this move. I also like Nh4, bullying the black queen. (after Qd6 or Qf6 , Ne4.) } Qf6 14. Nd5 {Good!} Qd6 15. Bf4 {Also very good! developing with tempi, and winning a bit of material here} Qe6 16. Qxe6 {This is slightly inaccurate, as after 16... fxe6! your knight and bishop are both under attack, and in order to not lose a piece you must play 17. Be3.  However, just 16. Nxc7! wins a pawn flat out} Bxe6 17. Nxc7 Rac8 18. Rfe1 {Good, but not the best move. I like 18. c3 preparing 19. d4, with strong center control and firmly planted pawns} a6 19. Bg3 {oh my, 19. c3! is overwhelming for black! for example: 19... Bd7 20. d4 Bb6 (or Be7) 21. Nd5 Bd8 22. Bd6 Re8 23. Rxe8+ Bxe8 24. Re1 Bd7 and black's pieces are clumped in their own little world, while white enjoys an open file, central space, active pieces, and completely has the initiative (all of the previous moves listed would be more or less forced for black)} Bb6 {Terrible move.. just giving away more material} 20. Nxe6 fxe6 21. Rxe6 Bd8 {You're absolutely killing him here.. should be a breeze rest of game. Your moves have been good, you've won material, and not made any real significant mistakes. I've only pointed out what could have been better. } 22. c3 {Good move! } Bf6 23. Bh4 Nd8 24. Re4 Nf7 25. Bxf6 gxf6 26. Rae1 Nd6 27. Re4e6 Nb5 28. Nh4 Nd4 29. cxd4 Rc2 30. Rb6 Rb8 31. Re7 Rd2 32. Rxf6 {I think 32. Nf5 forces mate within like 7 moves, lol} Rf8 33. Rg6+ Kh8 34. f3 {Silly, just take your free h6 pawn ;). You'd have to hang both rooks to lose this game though, lol} Rxb2 35. Rxh6+ Kg8 36. Rhh7 Rb6 37. Reg7# {Well played! Hope my tips give you some things to look for in regards to positional insight!}
