1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 {Starting out as a knights out first game.} 4. e3 Bf5 5. Bd3 {Move my bishop out to discourage black's bishop from marauding the king side.} Bg6 6. Bxg6 {Bishop exchange leads to ...} hxg6 {... black opening a rook file.} 7. Bd2 Qc7 {Black threatens the h2 pawn.} 8. g3 Nbd7 9. Qe2 {Moving queen out of the way for a queen-side castle.} e5 10. dxe5 {Pawn exchange to open up center-board.} Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Qxe5 {Pawn exchange leads to knight exchange.} 12. O-O-O O-O-O {And a mutual queen side castle.} 13. Qf3 {Move queen out of way for knight to move there.} Bd6 14. Ne2 Qe7 {I guess Black moved the queen back so bishop could take queen's spot.} 15. Bc3 {This is why I moved the knight out. So bishop could guard the main diagonal. If knight moves, then bishop has a direct line at the g7 pawn and can threaten the rook.} Kb8 16. Nd4 Be5 {I guess this is why Black moved the queen back, to let the bishop take a more aggressive spot.} 17. h4 a6 {The a6 pawn moves gives me an idea, ...} 18. Qe2 {... but first I will have to move my queen into position.} Ne4 {Knight moves forward to threaten bishop supporting my knight. But this is when I get to play out the idea I formed a moment ago.} 19. Qxa6 {Queen sacrifice! If bxa6 then I follow with Nxc6!+ forking Black's king and queen. I would then be up two pawns, have removed the pawns guarding Black's king, and have my knight ready for its next attack.} Nxf2 {I guess Black decides to do his own knight fork. I expected Black to move the queen to protect the c6 pawn or take my queen with the b pawn. But by moving his knight to fork my rooks, black leaves his queen undefended!} 20. Qb6 {So with my queen still alive and the c6 pawn vulnerable I now have a chance to do an even more devastating attack. I just have to move my queen to where the b pawn is pinned!} Nxh1 {Black goes for the rook. That's two moves in a row where Black is not responding to a major threat to his king and queen!} 21. Nxc6+ {The knight now forks king and queen.} Ka8 {Oops! Wrong move! Black should have moved the king to c8.} 22. Qa7# {And the game is over in 22 moves!}
