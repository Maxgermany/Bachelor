1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O {At the time this was considered inferior because it allows the pin which Black can initiate with his next move.} Bg4 {This weakens Black's Q-side.} 6. h3 {It's important to kick immediately.} Bh5 {As a result of this game 6... P-KR4 became fashionable.} 7. c3 Qf6 {Geller looked quite happy after his novelty, but sounder is 7... N-B3 8 P-Q4 N-Q2 bolstering the center.} 8. g4 {I realized the danger inherent in weakening my K-side, but felt that I could capitalize on Black's lack of development [the traffic jam on the K-side] before he could get to my King.} Bg6 9. d4 {It's worth a Pawn to open up the game.} Bxe4 {The threat was 10 B-KN5 followed by 11 P-Q5 winning a piece. He still looked happy.} 10. Nbd2 Bg6 {An attempt to rehabilitate Geller's line was made in Smyslov-Medina, Tel Aviv 1964, which continued 10... B-Q3 11 BxN ch PxB 12 R-K1 O-O-O, but 13 R-K3! proved to be very strong.} 11. Bxc6+ {Trading old advantages for new. Now Black's Q-side Pawns are a shambles and his King can expect no shelter there.} bxc6 12. dxe5 {A few weeks after the game it dawned on me that 12 Q-R4 would have been a tremendous shot. I was kicking myself for not playing it, but then I found that after 12 Q-R4 K-Q2! 13 PxP PxP 14 N-B4 B-Q3 White has no immediate way to exploit the exposed King.} dxe5 13. Nxe5 Bd6 {On 13... O-O-O, 14 Q-K2 K-N1 15 N-N3 [intending N-R5 ch] is murderous.} 14. Nxg6 {A litle surprise, permitting him to open his KR file.} Qxg6 {Geller took a half hour on this recapture and stopped looking happy. He rejected 14... RPxN 15 N-K4 Q-R5 16 NxB ch PxN 17 QxP QxRP? 18 R-K1 ch and mates.} 15. Re1+ Kf8 {Another difficult decision. On 15... N-K2 16 N-B4 O-O-O 17 Q-R4 White's attack comes first.} 16. Ne4 h5 {Still hoping to rise from the ashes and fan his attack.} 17. Nxd6 cxd6 {The best chance is 17... QxN.} 18. Bf4 d5 {Loses outright. In the post-mortem Mikhail Tal tried to hold the game with 18... R-Q1 19 Q-K2 PxP but after 20 PxP Black is in virtual zugzwang.} 19. Qb3 hxg4 {Geller spent about forty minutes on this move. If 19... N-K2 20 RxN! KxR 21 Q-N7 ch wins.} 20. Qb7 gxh3+ 21. Bg3 Rd8 22. Qb4+ {Black resigns. He must now lose both a Knight *and* a Rook.}
