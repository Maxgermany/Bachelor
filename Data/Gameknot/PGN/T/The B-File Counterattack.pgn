1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 5. h3 O-O 6. Bg5 d6 7. c3 h6 8. Bd2 Re8 9. Qc1 {Already preparing the bishop sac on h6. 9. O-O would have been better.} Be6 {Clamping down on the center with 9...d5 is better and gains control and an edge for black. } 10. Bxh6 {Probably the wrong capture. 10. Bxe6 Rxe6 would have been fine. } gxh6 11. Qxh6 Nh7 {Here Black should have captured the bishop to relieve some of the pressure. After 11...Bxc4 12. dxc4 Nxe4 Black has a small edge and covers the important ground of White's attack.} 12. Bb5 Qf6 13. Qh5 Qg6 14. Qh4 a6 15. Bxc6 bxc6 16. g4 Bd7 17. Nbd2 d5 18. O-O-O Be7 19. Qg3 Bd6 20. Nh4 Qf6 21. Rhg1 Qf4 22. Qg2 d4 23. Nf5 {(?!) - White actually gains the upper hand after this, ironically, because Black falls into the trap. However, 23. cxd4 exd4 then 24. Nf5 would have opened more lines, especially with ideas such as e4, and even Re1. } Bxf5 {Now White has the initiative. As mentioned before, Black keeps a small advantage with 23...dxc3. Now White wins a piece.} 24. gxf5+ Kf8 {24...Kh8?? loses immediately to 25. Qg7#. } 25. Qg7+ Ke7 26. Qxh7 dxc3 27. bxc3 Ba3+ {Although White still has a small advantage, Black has suddenly got an open b-file, and with a pinned knight by the Qf4, White must play precisely. } 28. Kc2 {The right move. 28. Kb1 walks into 28...Rab8+ with unforgivable outcomes. } Rab8 29. Nc4 {A shocking blunder. Black is hoping to remove the bishop and defend the square, but Black can now infiltrate. 29. Rb1 was best, guarding the file. Black can win the pawn, but White would have kept his small advantage.} Qxf2+ 30. Nd2 {White now loses immediately. Now that the g7 square is not protected, Black can now force mate. 30. Rd2 does lose a rook, but is the only move, and White can fight on. Black can now carry out his plan.} Rb2+ 31. Kc1 Rxd2+ 32. Kb1 Rb2+ {Mate follows either 33. Kc1 Qc2# or 33. Ka1 Rxa2+ 34. Kb1 Qb2# (or Qc2#).}
