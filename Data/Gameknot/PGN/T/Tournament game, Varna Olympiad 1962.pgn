1. c4 g6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 d5 {Fischer: I played this on the spur of the moment. I could see in his eyes that he had come prepared for a King's Indian.} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3 dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 Bg4 8. Be3 Nfd7 {Fischer: Smyslov's Variation. Theory has found no way to drive any clear advantage for White.} 9. Be2 Nc6 {Botvinnik: 9...N-N3 is more accurate.} 10. Rd1 Nb6 11. Qc5 Qd6 12. h3 {Fischer: 12 QxQ is answered by BPxQ! improving Black's Pawn structure and neutralizing White's center.} Bxf3 13. gxf3 Rfd8 {Botvinnik: 13...P-K3 gives Black an equal game.  Fischer: 13...P-K3 is not in the Hypermodern spirit, which is to tempt White into advancing his center Pawns in the hope they become overextended.} 14. d5 {Fischer: Opening the diagonal of Black's KB can't be right.} Ne5 15. Nb5 {Botvinnik: 15 P-B4 is not good because 15...N/4-B5 16 BxN QxQ 17 BxQ NxB 18 P-K5 NxNP 19 R-Q4 P-KB3! and White's central position breaks up.  Fischer: On 15 P-B4 also playable is N/4-Q2 16 Q-N5 P-K4! 17 P-B5 with equal chances.} Qf6 16. f4 Ned7 17. e5 {Botvinnik: When I was preparing to meet Smyslov, I made a thorough analysis of the Smyslov System in general and of this position in particular! I reckoned that whether the Black Queen went to KR5 or KB4, it would be in danger... alas, my opponent found a third continuation!} Qxf4 {Botvinnik: A very unpleasant surprise -- now White really had to start playing... it was obvious that in my analysis I had missed what Fischer had found with the greatest of ease at the board. My equanimity was wrecked.  Fischer: When I made this move, I felt sure he had overlooked it.} 18. Bxf4 Nxc5 19. Nxc7 Rac8 20. d6 exd6 21. exd6 Bxb2 {Botvinnik: So Black has won a Pawn; but the Knight on QB7 and the Pawn on Q6 confine his Rooks -- and also, White has two Bishops. The first thing White must do is complete his development.} 22. O-O Nbd7 {Botvinnik: A bad mistake. Now White has the two important squares Q5 and QB4 at his disposal and his spatial advantage becomes crushing. After 22...N/4-Q2 23 B-B3 B-K4 24 BxB NxB 25 BxP R-N1 White has no more than a minimal advantage.  Fischer: I couldn't disagree more. Why should Black return the Pawn?} 23. Rd5 b6 24. Bf3 {Botvinnik: Feeble play. The Bishop is out of it at KB3 and merely becomes the object of attack.} Ne6 {Botvinnik: Apparently, this forces the exchange of the Knight on Qb7, as 25 B-R2 N-Q5 26 B-N2 N-KB3 is very bad for White. In fact, even here 26 RxN! [pointed out by Geller] BxR 27 R-K1 gives White a real chance to get out of all his troubles. A second error running makes his position hopeless.  Fischer: Judge for yourself whether in Geller's line White has any real compensation for the Exchange and a Pawn. 27...B-B4 extricates Black.} 25. Nxe6 {Fischer: This really took me aback. After 25 B-K3 at least White's still in the game.} fxe6 26. Rd3 Nc5 27. Re3 e5 28. Bxe5 {Fischer: Leads to a dead lost ending. I expected 28 RxP to try and keep a little "dynamic imbalance".} Bxe5 29. Rxe5 Rxd6 30. Re7 Rd7 31. Rxd7 Nxd7 32. Bg4 {Botvinnik: A pointless move, since White cannot go into the lost Rook and Pawn ending.} Rc7 33. Re1 Kf7 34. Kg2 {Botvinnik: 34 B-K6 ch was preferable, as the Bishop is poorly posted at KN4.} Nc5 35. Re3 Re7 36. Rf3+ Kg7 37. Rc3 Re4 38. Bd1 Rd4 {Botvinnik: This move gave me new heart. By 38...R-K8! White's defenses could have been completely disorganized.  Fischer: After 38...R-K8 White plays simply 39 B-B3.} 39. Bc2 Kf6 40. Kf3 Kg5 41. Kg3 Ne4+ 42. Bxe4 Rxe4 43. Ra3 {Botvinnik: Natural and bad. White is now again in danger of defeat. 43 R-B7!! was essential.} Re7 44. Rf3 Rc7 45. a4 {At this point Fischer sealed his move.} Rc5 46. Rf7 Ra5 47. Rxh7 {Botvinnik: Found during overnight analysis by Geller.  Fischer: This was the first defense I had considered. Passive play for White is hopeless.} Rxa4 48. h4+ {Fischer: I had analyzed mainly 48 P-B4 ch, but Botvinnik's line is best.} Kf5 49. Rf7+ Ke5 50. Rg7 Ra1 51. Kf3 {The critical position of the game. There is a win for Black, but it is extremely difficult to find over-the-board, and Fischer misses it.} b5 {This move guarantees a draw.   Fischer/Botvinnik joint analysis: Black's winning line is 51...K-Q5! 52 RxP P-N4 53 P-R5 P-N5 54 P-R6! P-N6 55 R-N4 ch K-B4! 56 R-N5 ch K-B3! 57 R-N6 ch K-N2! 58 R-N7 ch K-R3! 59 R-N6 ch K-R4! 60 R-N5 ch K-R5! 61 R-N4 ch K-R6 62 R-R4 P-N7 63 P-R7 P-N8 (Q) 64 P-R8 (Q) Q-N6 ch! 65 K-K2 Q-Q8 ch 66 K-K3 R-N8!! 67 Q-B8 ch K-R7, leaving White's King with no shelter from, in Fischer's words, "the coming avalanche of checks".} 52. h5 Ra3+ 53. Kg2 gxh5 {Fischer: Botvinnik visibly relaxed. I had played right into his hands.} 54. Rg5+ Kd6 55. Rxb5 h4 56. f4 Kc6 57. Rb8 h3+ 58. Kh2 a5 59. f5 Kc7 60. Rb5 Kd6 {Botvinnik: Generally speaking, this ending would be drawn even without the KBP -- any textbook on the endgame will tell you this.} 61. f6 Ke6 62. Rb6+ Kf7 63. Ra6 Kg6 64. Rc6 a4 65. Ra6 Kf7 66. Rc6 Rd3 67. Ra6 a3 68. Kg1 {Draw agreed.  Botvinnik: "Too many mistakes?" the reader may justly ask. Yes, there were rather a lot!}
