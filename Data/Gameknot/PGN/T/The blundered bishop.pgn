1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nbd2 c5 {Finally, I find the challenging line. This is the one black has to play. Exchanging is to set free his dsb, not doing it is allowing cxd, Nxd4, Nc6, Nb5! and a known line black can get out from easily, c3 and e3... } 5. c3 {e3 was better, but there is no difference here. } Bd6 {Thematic, but off-tempo.} 6. Ne5 {My standard response.} O-O 7. e3 {No difference from before.} Nc6 {My last hope, Nd7 (Nxf7!) was not played, so the game is going even. Every scheme has its weak point, any tempo, if well spent, can do the difference. Time to stike. } 8. g4 {A very thematic one. } h6 {g5 now gives and exchange, the opening of the g coumn... BUT also allows NxNe5, dxN, Bxe5... and I know by experience it can be disastrous for white. } 9. h4 {This move is much in the spirit of "creating pressure". But now I'll have given Rg1 a serious look, or simply Nd2-f3, to reinforce the center. I just want to keep my Q able to reach h5, if needed, at any time.  } Nh7 {Well done! But I can still build pressure...} 10. g5 {I am conceding the center, but I have to get something from my incursion, and maybe he can play the second best.} f6 {Uff... a tactic melee is in progress, here! NxN, bxN, gxh! would have been correct. I went} 11. Ng6 {Not wise, since Rf7 helps him more than favours me. Anyway, I still have gxh6.} e5 {Fighting with all he has, as I told you, with a center counterattack. } 12. Nxf8 {Cahing the exchange.} Qxf8 {Now what? Bg3? How sad! I have d5 in mind, but I found no way to get to it with the B. And gxh3?, exB, hxg7, and black can safely play Qxg7 because g1 is not supported. I can threat Rg1, but black can probably defend. I didn't want to be "too" fool.} 13. g6 {The reason is: after the fuzz, I will have the white diagonal combined with the g column. So I am surprisingly switching my target - a creative strategy. I think now it was just a bad move. Bxh6!?, gxB, g6! and the black N is lost all the same, and the g column is opened (for good or for evil!). } exf4 {First pawn away.} 14. gxh7+ Kxh7 {Black can still block me with f5, but I have a lsb, too. First, I have to remove the last obstacle.} 15. dxc5 {Second pawn out, and tempo! But black is just as me (I like him!): he takes risks!} fxe3 {!? I didn't accept the gift. I am too weak on the dark squares to allow a black Q in d6, with nice perspectives. I have to cash my prize first: } 16. Bd3+ {If g6, Qh5 (finally!).} Kh8 {For some reason, f5 was not preferred. Nobody wants to play with a pinned pawn, and if f5, fxe6 and the lsb is closed in. } 17. fxe3 {?? I preferred the pawn, but it was another mistake! Now, I am the weak side!} Bg3+ {Ouch!} 18. Kf1 Qxc5 {Ouch! I have to be very careful. } 19. Qe2 {Not Qf3, because of Ne5, and the exchange doesn't favour me. } Ne5 {Now I can decide if to save my B or...} 20. Nb3 {...reorganize my troops.} Qc6 {Creates a nasty discovered attack on Rh1.} 21. Nd4 {Still improving the position of my pieces. Now I can propose an exchange on f5 and... look at the Bg3.} Qb6 {Black now has NxB, and after QxN, Qxb2. I have to prevent that (b3 is a possibilty). I have to deprive the Ne5 from playing any useful move, and with MY N in f5, instead... So if I go there with my B, it is safe! On the other side, be aware: if I play Rg1?, Bh3 and I lose the exchange and the tempo.} 22. Bf5 {Now I can play Rh3 and win the B. Only counter black has is Nc4, and I'll answer Rb1} Bxf5 {The good side is black frees his last R. But in the process, he loses a B.} 23. Nxf5 {A pity. Now, can my opponent counterattack?} Qe6 {?? Nc4 attacks e3 all the same, forcing me to defend, and with nasty threats. This just allows me to take it. } 24. Nxg3 Ng4 {...so I can't defend e3. Too bad. I am +4... } 25. e4 {Then let's exchange it for a central pawn, and offer a Q's exchange!} dxe4 {What else? Maybe Re8, or Rd8, hoping in white to exchange.} 26. Qxe4 {It's not the moment for looking for something else. Just time to slow down and win with the extra material!} Qa6+ {Still risky, with that N still on g4. } 27. c4 {Maybe not a good idea.} Ne5 {The N is away from the dangerous area, I am somewhat +4 again... can you explain me what happened? :-D :-D Yes, we both played awfully!} 28. b3 {Do you really want to sac the N in order to open it?} Rd8 {The board says +4, but I can't feel it in my bones...} 29. Nf5 {A N on d5, if prperly defended, can be a good way to stop black But I must have something on the black's K...} b5 {Here he comes. Now my plan is... to stand the storm, sweep away, and cash the win. I don't believe in plain defence. } 30. Rg1 {He won't resist, and I bet my life I can survive.} bxc4 {I know, I know, but I need one more tempo. } 31. Rxg7 {This is more to make room to my K!} cxb3+ 32. Kg1 Qb6+ {? I am not sure if after b2 I was boosted or not. I think yes, I am still two moves far from being dangerous for black...} 33. Kh1 {Bye bye!} bxa2 {? } 34. Rb7 {! I bet that after this move, black is boosted. } Qf2 {Now, I think there only one precise move that grants white the point. No else. } 35. Nd4 {! ...because it prevents Qf3+, exchanging Qs. Am I right? My opponent timeoutted, but it was ony few seconds. }
