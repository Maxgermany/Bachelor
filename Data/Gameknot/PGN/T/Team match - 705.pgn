1. c4 {A few notes on this game. A team match against Rosedale17, I also won the other as White. This was also my first time ever playing against an English opening. After I saw this move I had to do a little research and prepare myself for what was to come. Near the middle game I started grasping at straws as I did not know what I should/could move. White made a fatal mistake which allowed me to grab a free bishop and knight. After that point the game consists in Black pushing a passed pawn and keeping the pressure on the semi-exposed White King. } e5 2. e4 Bc5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. d3 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. O-O Nc6 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 Nd4 {This is where I started grasping at straws, although I did like the aggressive post of the knight and wasn't afraid to exchange. } 9. Bg3 a6 10. Nc3 c6 11. Nh4 b5 12. cxb5 axb5 13. a3 {The pawns were really me trying to buy some time. I liked the idea of weakening the White Queenside and attacking, but had no co-ordinated plan in mind. } Be6 {Me REALLY grasping at straws. My only thought was that I wanted my rooks/queen to be connected and need to develop my bishop and put more pressure on the Queenside. } 14. b4 Bb6 15. f4 {White's fatal mistake. Black discover double checks White resulting in a free bishop and knight. Not sure what move would be best for White, perhaps 15. a4 or some Queen activity. } Nxe2+ 16. Kh1 Nxc3 17. Qc2 Bd4 18. f5 Ncxe4 19. dxe4 Bxa1 20. Rxa1 {The exchange did not net any value for Black but at this point I wanted to rid White of his heavy pieces and push towards a favorable endgame. } Bc4 21. Nf3 Re8 {Planing to clear out the pawn on e4 and advance. } 22. Nd2 d5 23. exd5 {Plan accomplished. } Qxd5 24. Nf3 e4 25. Nh4 e3 26. Nf3 Ne4 27. Bf4 {Not a great move for White as it frees f2 for the knight, although I may have taken the bishop just to double up White's pawns and further expose the King. } e2 28. h3 {I think this move is pointless for White. Black doesn't have enough pieces bearing down on e1 to mate. This could change but meanwhile White could have done something more productive. } Nf2+ 29. Kg1 {Also a silly move, if you are going to play h3 then why not take advantage of it? } Nxh3+ {White resigns. Later play probably involves the Knights being taken and then White is in real trouble as Black can force the promotion. }
