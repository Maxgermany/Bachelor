1. e4 c5 {Sicilian Defense, one of my favourites} 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 a6 {d5 was possible, but I did not want to open the e-file with my King in the centre} 6. a3 {I think a4 is better, controlling b5} Qc7 {The alternatives were b5 or d5} 7. Qe2 b5 8. Ba2 Be7 9. g3 {A strange move. I think this is not the best move. White should play somehting like c3, then Rd1 and try to play d4} d6 {During the game, I had the idea of Nd7 and Bf6, controlling the central dark squares} 10. Bd2 {Not the best square for the bishop, if 10 Bf4 black plays Nd7 stopping e5. Again, better was c3} Bb7 11. Nc3 Nd7 12. h4 Nde5 13. Nh2 {Dubious move, allowing black's knights to enter on e5 and d4. Better was 13 Nxe5 dxe5 14 Qg4 with some attack} Nd4 14. Qd1 O-O 15. f4 Nec6 {White took the control of e5, but now his king is weak} 16. Ng4 b4 {Black's advantage is in the queenside, so he opens the position in this side} 17. Ne2 bxa3 18. bxa3 Nxe2+ 19. Qxe2 Nd4 20. Qd1 d5 {Now, opening the centre, because white pieces are not coordinated} 21. exd5 {If e5, black plays Nf5 and then d4. Better was 21 c3 Nb5 22 exd5 exd5 23 a4 and black Knight has to retreat} exd5 22. h5 h6 {Stopping the unpleasant treat of h6} 23. Be3 {Now, if white plays c3, black follows with Nf5 and d4} Rfe8 {Taking the control of the file. The alternative was Nf5} 24. Ne5 Bd6 {The knight is well placed, so black forces it to retreat. Again, the alternative was Nf5} 25. Bxd4 {if white does not play this, black will play Nf5 and d4} cxd4 26. Nf3 Re3 27. Kg2 Bxa3 {Why not? I am winning a pawn} 28. Bxd5 {A bad move. It regains the pawn, but it opens the h1-a8 diagonal for the black bishop and allows a unpleasant pin on f3} Bxd5 29. Rxa3 Rae8 30. Rf2 {30 Rxa6 Re2+ 31 Kg1 (31Kh1 is the same thing; if 31 Kh3 Qc8+; if 31 Rf2 Bxf3+ 32 Kxf3 Qb7+) Bxf3 32 Rxf3 Re1+ winning the queen } Bxf3+ 31. Rxf3 Re3e1 {Winning the queen, because if 31 Qd2 black plays R8e2+ (as in the game)} 32. Qd2 Re8e2+ 33. Rf2 Qc6+ {Better than eating the queen, now black forces mate} 34. Kh3 Rh1+ 35. Kg4 f5+ {And white resigned. if 36 Kxf5 Qe6#}
