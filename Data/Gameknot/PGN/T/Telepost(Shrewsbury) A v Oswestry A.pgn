1. e4 {He starts with the usual.} c5 {I play the Sicilian.} 2. Nc3 {Closed Sicilian.} Nc6 {I copy him.} 3. f4 {The usual, aggressive line. 2. f4 immediately is well met with 2....d5, hence 2. Nc3 first.} g6 {I fianchetto, aiming for control of the d4 square. } 4. Nf3 {Usual development.} Bg7 {Completing the fianchetto.} 5. Bb5 {Hitting the knight.} Nd4 {Attacking his bishop and not allowing the doubling of my pawns.} 6. O-O {Castles.} Nxb5 {Takes.} 7. Nxb5 {Takes back.} a6 {Attack the knight.} 8. Nc3 {Knight drops back.} b5 {Gaining space on the queen-side.} 9. d3 {Preparing to develop the bishop.} d6 {Likewise.} 10. Qe1 {Perhaps played with the idea of Qe1-h4 should I castle king side.} b4 {I hit the knight.} 11. Nd5 {Knight advances.} e6 {I hit the knight.} 12. Ne3 {Knight drops back.} Ne7 {Development.} 13. f5 {I can't take three times on f5 without losing a piece because of the half-pin on the e file.} O-O {So I castle.} 14. g4 {I think this is a mistake, just losing a pawn. I was expecting 14. Nh4.} exf5 {I take.} 15. gxf5 {Takes back.} gxf5 {Takes again.} 16. Nh4 {With complications...} fxe4 {Takes again.} 17. dxe4 {Takes back.} d5 {Thematic central break to distract from attempted king-side attack.} 18. Nef5 {Threatening to take off my powerful Bg7} Nxf5 {Takes.} 19. Nxf5 {Takes back.} Bxf5 {Takes again.} 20. exf5 {Takes back.} Qe8 {Contesting the e file.} 21. Qxe8 {Takes.} Rfxe8 {Takes back.} 22. f6 {Attacks bishop.} Bf8 {Bishop drops back.} 23. Bf4 {He develops his bishop at last.} Re2 {I seize the second rank.} 24. Rad1 {He counter attacks.} Rxc2 {I take.} 25. Rxd5 {He takes back.} Rxb2 {Takes yet again.} 26. Kh1 {He wants to play Rg1.} Re8 {Developing my other rook.} 27. Rd7 {He seizes the 7th rank.} c4 {Passed pawns must be pushed!} 28. Rg1+ {Throws in a check.} Kh8 {Virtually forced.} 29. Rxf7 {Takes.} Bc5 {I attack his rook.} 30. Rd1 {Rook moves.} c3 {Onward again! "30...c3, 31.Rc7!  It seems that 30...c3 wasn't such a good idea. Maybe 30...h5 would have been safer." archduke_piccolo} 31. Re7 {Oops! I had completely missed this move.} Rf8 {Trying to blosk his pawn.} 32. Be5 {He takes control of the important diagonal.} h6 {Played to give my king a flight square.} 33. Rdd7 {He doubles on the 7th rank, threatening mate.} Rb1+ {I check.} 34. Kg2 {King moves.} Rg1+ {Check again.} 35. Kh3 {More or less forced. I am now protecting g7, so there is no mate threat.} c2 {I advance.} 36. Reh7+ {He throws in a check.} Kg8 {Forced.} 37. Bb2 {Bishop drops back. Now if I queen, he just takes, and I can't take back as he has mate in two. "37.Bb2 (I think - from memory - 37.Rdg7ch at once would have secured the draw)  37... Bd4!!  ensures the pawn will promote as Black has to prevent the mate." archduke_piccolo} Be3 {So this threatens to queen.} 38. Rdg7+ {Checks.} Rxg7 {Takes} 39. Rxg7+ {Takes back.} Kh8 {Forced.} 40. f7 {his own advanced pawn is powerful too!} c1=Q {I at last queen.} 41. Rg8+ {He checks, from both rook and bishop, my reply is forced.} Kh7 {No option.} 42. Rg7+ {Checks again.} Kh8 {Forced again. Draw by perpetual check. "Fantastic game, though! I haven't looked closely into the earlier part of the game, but I like the strategic dichotomy of White's K-side attack vs Black's on the Q-side, especially as it persists even into the 2R + B late middle game. (Incidentally, I don't call the late play end games unless and until the number of pieces have been reduced to two or fewer.)   Cheers,  Ion" (archduke_piccolo) Many thanks for reading.
