1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 f5 3. d4 exd4 4. Qxd4 d6 5. Nh3 h6 6. g3 Nc6 7. Qe3+ Qe7 8. Nd5 {transposing to a game without Queen... Kind of a cool idea if your goal is a draw} Qxe3 9. Bxe3 {white is much more developed. So, the end of the queens may be a good thing for white, after all} Kd8 {Nd5 was pointing on c7} 10. O-O-O {black is confined in its development. White just need the bishop to be developed.} Nge7 11. Bg2 Be6 12. Nhf4 Bxd5 13. cxd5 {better than Nxd5 to my opinion.} Ne5 14. Ne6+ Kd7 15. Kb1 {c7 is becoming the center of the world.} g5 16. Rdc1 Rc8 17. Rc2 c5 18. dxc6 e.p.+ bxc6 19. Nd4 c5 20. Nb3 Ng4 21. Rd1 {c5 is no more defended.} Nxe3 22. fxe3 Ke6 {Now it is again.} 23. Bb7 {bishop is pointing the a6-d3 diagonal} Rc7 24. Ba6 Ke5 {audacious king...Is he going to white camp?} 25. Rcd2 Nc6 26. a3 Be7 27. Bc4 a5 28. Rd2d5+ {now pointing to f5} Kf6 29. Bd3 Ne5 30. Rf1 {f5 definitely} Nxd3 31. Rdxf5+ {better this order, than exd3} Kg6 32. exd3 {And the pawns are now well arranged again} a4 33. Nd2 Rb8 {finally a black threat on b2} 34. Rf5f2 d5 35. Nf3 Bd8 36. Ne5+ {have you noticed the wonderful journey of this knight?} Kg7 37. Rf2f7+ Rxf7 38. Rxf7+ {allowing the small difference to take greater proportion} Kg8 39. Rd7 {gaining another pawn} Bf6 {pointing on b2 again} 40. Rxd5 Rb3 41. Nc4 Be7 42. Kc2 Kf7 43. d4 cxd4 44. Rxd4 Bc5 45. Rd3 {ready to exchange some more material.} Rb8 46. Kd2 Kf6 47. e4 {now e-pawn is going to win the game, thanks to the knight} Bg1 {strange idea} 48. h3 Rc8 49. e5+ {i calculated this carefully. Nothing black could do was good (as far as I saw)} Kf5 50. g4+ Kf4 51. Kc3 Rb8 52. e6 Bf2 {losing time} 53. Nd6 {final move for this brave brave knigh} Rb3+ 54. Kc2 Rb6 55. e7 {nothing gonna stop me now...}
