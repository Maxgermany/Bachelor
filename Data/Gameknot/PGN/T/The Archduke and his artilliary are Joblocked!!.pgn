1. d4 {1.d4 - Ion decides on queen pawn opening play.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 {2. ....... dxc4 - the QGA.} 3. e3 e5 4. Bxc4 exd4 5. exd4 {5. exd4 - a plethora of exchanges leaves Ion with an isolated queen pawn.  Can I exploit this?  We shall see.} Nf6 6. Qb3 Qe7+ {6. ..... Qe7+ - after Ion's Q and lsb pile up on my poor little f7 pawn, Glenda finds herself pressed into defensive (and attacking?) duties on only move 7.} 7. Be3 Qb4+ 8. Nc3 Qxb3 9. Bxb3 {9. Bxb3 - queen trade.  At least the threat on f7 has now disappeared but Ion has a lead in development.  I need to clear the decks fast!} c6 10. Nf3 Be6 11. Bxe6 fxe6 {11. ...... fxe6 - this bishop trade now leaves me with an isolani.  However, at least one of Ion's active pieces is no more.} 12. Ke2 Nd5 13. Ng5 Ke7 {13. ...... Ke7 - Henry must defend that e6 pawn and stop a knight incursion onto f7.  Although one of my knights is on an active square I still have to develop my queen knight and Fou Lenoir.} 14. Nce4 h6 15. Nf3 Nd7 {15. ..... Nd7 - Ion's knight has been driven back and I have now developed my queen knight.  I must somehow find a way to get Fou Lenoir in the game.} 16. h4 Kf7 17. g4 Be7 {17. .... Be7 - at last Fou Lenoir is in play and I have now cleared the decks.  Ion still has the more active position sigh and double sigh!} 18. h5 Nd7f6 19. Nxf6 Bxf6 {19. ....... Bxf6 - Knight trade.} 20. Rag1 Nxe3 21. fxe3 Rae8 {21. ...... Rae8 - In the chat Ion wondered why I exchanged my active knight for his seemingly passive bishop and for uniting his d pawn with his e pawn.  The solution is in this move.  It prepares e5 where I will swap off my isolated e pawn with his d pawn giving him an isolated e pawn.  However, the plan did not work out in the way I expected.} 22. Rgf1 Kg8 23. Ne5 Bxe5 24. dxe5 {24. dxe5 - the pawn push to e5 was scuppered by Ion playing his rook to f1.  I would have lost a pawn if I had played e5 due to the rook pinning Fou Lenoir against Henry once his knight moved.  However, Ion gives himself a doubleton isolani on the same file as my own isolani so at least I have given him a bit of a concession.  However, there is a danger that Ion could make use of the f and d files for his rooks and so I must now prevent a rook incursion on my second rank by playing my rook to e7 on the next turn.} Re7 25. Rf4 Kh7 26. Rhf1 Rd8 {26. ...... Rd8 - preparing to double on the d column and then harass King Ion.} 27. Rd4 Rxd4 28. exd4 {28. exd4 - rook trade} Kg8 29. Kd3 Rf7 30. Rxf7 Kxf7 {30. ..... Kxf7 - so I find myself in my first ever K&P ending against The Coach.  Can Henry get over to the queenside to stop King Ion coming in trying to gobble up my pawns?  We shall see.} 31. Kc4 Ke7 32. a4 {32. a4 - was expecting Kc5.} b6 33. b3 {33. b3 and DRAW OFFER of which I accept immediately.  Gameknot analysis describes the position as roughly even with the miniscule edge in Ion's favour so this turned out to be a good acceptance.  Avoiding a rout against Ion is a victory in itself!}
