1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f6 4. d3 Bc5 5. O-O Nge7 6. c4 a6 7. Ba4 O-O 8. Nh4 d6 9. Bxc6 Nxc6 10. Qf3 {Probably continuing development is better, say Be3, Nf6, etc.} g6 11. Nc3 {Getting saddled up and preparing an attack, say with 11. Qg3, and even Bh6 } Nd4 {Seems like a plausible idea, with ideas of Nc2, however, White can soon drive the knight away - 11...f5, however, is a safe defensive option that keeps White at bay.} 12. Qg3 Bb4 {Probably 12...Rf7 is better. White can build up a dangerous attack with an inventive sacrifice} 13. Kh1 {White is trying to push himself away from the action, but it was time to create action of his own with 13. Nxg6! then 13...hxg6 14. Qxg6+ Kh8 15. Qh5+ Kg8 and White has a good attack for the material deficit. } c6 {Probably maybe 13...Bxc3 14. bxc3 Ne2 15. Qe3 Nxc3 works out better for Black.} 14. Be3 {White misses 14. Bh6 g5 15. a3 Bxc3 16. bxc3 Nb3 with a slight advantage} Nc2 {Seems logical to trade off the menacing bishop, but 14...Bxc3 15. bxc3 Ne2 16. Qf3 Nxc3 - wins a pawn and keeps a dangerous knight on - making White having to think both defense and attack.} 15. Rab1 {Bh6, starting the attack might have been simpler.} c5 16. Nd5 {Ambiguous - Still, Bh6 wasn't too late. } Be6 17. Rbc1 {Certainly the last time to play Bh6.} Nxe3 18. Nxe3 {Probably recapturing with the pawn may have been better; the rook would have a half-open f-file to operate. Things seem level. } Bd2 19. Rc2 Bxe3 20. fxe3 b5 21. cxb5 axb5 22. Rcf2 Ra7 23. a3 Raf7 24. Rc1 Qa5 25. Rcf1 Qd8 {Maybe getting out of the firing line with 25...Kh8 might have been better} 26. Nf3 f5 {Interesting approach; uncorking the bottle. Probably 26...d5 Qxd5 gives better chances for a counter attack.} 27. exf5 {27. Ng5, forks the bishop and rook and forces a trade of pawns, and probably the better option.} Bxf5 28. Ng5 Rf7f6 29. Qh4 h5 30. h3 {This is a dubious option, which was countered by a more dubious reply. 30. Ne4 keeps things solid.} Bxh3 {An unsound sacrifice - capturing the d pawn with 30...Bxd3 would have fine. After 31. Rxf6 Rxf6 32. Rf3 Rxf3 33. gxf3 d5 34. Qg3 Qe7 Black does have a slight advantage. } 31. gxh3 {Black now wins a piece. The in-between capture with 31. Rxf6 wins a piece after 31...Rxf6 32. Rxf6 Qxf6 33. gxh3 but things would most likely be level.} Rf6xf2 32. Rxf2 Rxf2 33. Qxf2 Qxg5 34. e4 {Black has now up a pawn; but White should sufficiently scrape a draw. Black has other ideas.} Qf4 {Now mistakes come fast. 34. Kg7, holding the pawns was a better idea. Black is trying to exchange queens so he can push home his material advantage.} 35. Qg1 {However, If White had traded queens with 35. Qxf4 exf4 36. b3 Kf7 37. h4 f3 38. Kg1 Ke6 White eventually captures the pawn and even has a small advantage which would end up in a draw.} Qf3+ {Once again, the immediate 35...Kg7 is better.} 36. Kh2 {Trying to force the queen exchange is better, as the Black king is too far away to make any immediate impact. If 36. Qg2 Qxg2+ 37. Kxg2, the advantage lies with Black, but White should have counterplay. The outcome would be uncertain, but I like Black at this point.} Qf4+ {see the previous note (Kg7!)} 37. Kh1 {and again....Qg2!} g5 {once again, Kg7!} 38. Qg2 Qc1+ 39. Kh2 Qf4+ 40. Kh1 g4 41. hxg4 hxg4 42. Kg1 Kg7 43. b4 cxb4 44. axb4 Kg6 45. Kh1 {Qe2 keeps the ship at bay, and forces more complications for Black. } Qf3 {This is the last time White can gain a tempo with this capture. 45...Kg5! is best, when Black can  defend the pawn in time.} 46. Kh2 {And of course, White loses his chance to draw and to take advantage of Black's mistake. 46. Qxf3 gxf3 47. Kh2, etc, takes the pawn and levels things up. Now Black can exchange and win by forcing his pawn through.} Qxg2+ 47. Kxg2 Kg5 48. Kg3 Kh5 49. Kg2 {This was given as a blunder, as Black's task is exponentially easier. 49. Kf2! Gaining a tempo causes Black more problems, but eventually, Black still wins. The rest of the moves are more or less forced.} Kh4 50. Kh2 g3+ 51. Kg2 Kg4 52. Kg1 Kf3 53. Kh1 Kf2 54. d4 g2+ 55. Kh2 g1=Q+ 56. Kh3 Qg3# {An interesting game that brought blunders in both the opening and towards the middlegame, and it was Black who came through in the end. }
