1. d4 h6 2. e4 d5 3. e5 f6 4. exf6 Nxf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. Be2 Qd7 8. Bf4 Bf5 9. O-O Bh3 {This was an interesting move by Black. Capturing the bishop with my pawn would lead to an opening in front of my king, so perhaps that is what my opponent's intentions were. I do end up taking the bishop, but it doesn't work out as well for Black as it could have. Also, Black doesn't really have enough support in that area to force a checkmate anyways.} 10. gxh3 Qxh3 11. Re1 {Moving my rook out of danger} Ng4 {Both my knight and my bishop protect the key square of h2, so black cannot force a checkmate.} 12. Bf1 Qh5 13. h3 Nf6 14. Bg2 e6 15. Bxc7 {Taking the unprotected pawn} Ne4 16. Nxe4 {I take black's knight, but black doesn't reciprocate, possibly because I could then take both e-column pawns with my rook. But still, a knight is worth way more than two pawns, so I would have done it.} Nd7 17. Nd6+ Bxd6 18. Bxd6 {Exchange of pieces complete.} Qg6 {Not sure what Black's plan is here. } 19. Ne5 Nxe5 20. Bxe5 {Exchange of knights.} Rf8 21. Bg3 {Moving my bishop to further protect my king.} Qf6 22. Qh5+ Ke7 23. Bh4 g5 {The only move that could still save the Queen.} 24. Bg3 Qxd4 {Black takes the pawn} 25. Qxh6 {I take the pawn} Rf7 {Again, not sure what Black wants to do here. Perhaps predicting me to move my queen to h7 and check the king, even though a better move at this point is Qxg5+, since it also gains me a pawn.} 26. Qxg5+ Kd7 27. Qg6 {Planning for my next move to be Qxe6+, but Black predicts that.} Re7 28. Rad1 {Threatening the queen.} Qxb2 29. Bh4 Rh8 {Not sure what this was about. Now Black loses a rook, too. } 30. Bxe7 Kxe7 31. Qxe6+ {Checking the king. This is the first move in a forced checkmate. } Kd8 32. Rxd5+ {Taking the pawn and bringing my rook in for support.} Kc7 33. Qd7+ Kb6 34. Re6+ {Bringing my other rook in for support.} Ka7 35. Re8 {Not sure why I did this; I was thinking that Black would take the bait and exchange rooks so that there wouldn't be any more protection for the king in that area. } Qc1+ 36. Rd1 {Black offers me an opportunity for a checkmate. My bishop now has a clear path to b7 to support my queen for the mate. Black will either move the queen, allowing me to mate, or will move the king to avoid mate and let me take the queen. } Qxc2 37. Qxb7# {Mate. I think Black's biggest problem in this game was making too many careless mistakes and taking risks without considering every possible outcome, thereby allowing me to take pieces and gain an advantage early on. Also, by focusing on taking my pawns with the queen, Black essentially killed off the queen and made the queen useless when it came down to forcing mate. }
