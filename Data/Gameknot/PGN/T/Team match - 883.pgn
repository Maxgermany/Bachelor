1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Interesting so far. F4 is actually a pretty bad move usually but if he can clutter up the centre with his pawns and knights (which he does very well) he may live to tell the tale.} exf4 {Obvious move. This is a King's gambit accepted, supposedly an "antiquated" opening. Apparently not.} 3. Nf3 {On my database, this move is played 8 times out of 10. Why would anyone play anything else?} Nf6 {At this point my computer claims that g6,d6 or d5, not nf6 are the best moves.Interesting.} 4. Nc3 {Correct move here is definitely e5 but nc3 is the next best thing.} Bc5 {Developing.} 5. d4 {My Computer is half for and half against. 2 lines say i'm losing 2, say i'm winning.} Bb4 6. Bd3 {This stops 6. ... Nxe4, because the knight cannot retake due to it being pinned to the king.} O-O 7. Bxf4 d5 {! This move wins a piece and destroys white's position. He just doesn't know it yet.} 8. O-O {This does make the positional damage slightly less painful but perhaps he should have concentrated on his E pawn?} Bxc3 9. bxc3 dxe4 {This beautiful move is the reason why i played d5. White resigns because, like I said, he is a piece down and his position shattered.}
