1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {The Richter-Rouzer variation. Rather unlike the Sozin which is an opportunistic positional treatment creating steady pressure against Black's center, the Richter-Rouzer aims to conjure up a tactics-based attack on Black's K-side. In the Sozin White castles K-side; in the R-R he castles long and plays to cram his K-side pawns down Black's throat.} e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O Nbd7 {So far, so book.} 10. g4 h6 11. Bh4 g5 {!? This continuation has been around for a long time, but I seldom see it played at GM levels anymore, and only very rarely at the level of chess most of us mortals play on. Must be a "fashion" thing. Regardless, the move aims to create a hole at e5 for a Black Knight, a post that lays groundwork for a Black counterattack striking from the center and up the half-open c-file.} 12. fxg5 Ne5 13. Qe2 hxg5 14. Bxg5 Nfxg4 15. Bf4 Bd7 16. Bg2 b5 17. h3 Nf6 18. Bxe5 dxe5 19. Nf3 b4 20. Nb1 Bb5 21. Qe1 Rc8 {Black has lost his peachy Knight at e5 but White, in capturing it, has been thrown on the defensive and it is now Black who's attacking. Notice a common theme in this sharp continuation, following ...g5 Black often has no time to castle: his game often balances on that gain of a single tempo. The second player must have good nerves to choose to leave his King in the center.} 22. Rd2 a5 23. Bf1 Bc6 24. Bd3 a4 25. Re2 Nh5 26. Qf2 Nf4 27. Rd2 b3 28. a3 Nxd3+ 29. Rxd3 bxc2 30. Qxc2 Bxe4 31. Qxc7 Rxc7+ {Black is a clear pawn up and has the Bishop-pair, and White's King is terribly exposed.} 32. Kd2 Bxd3 33. Kxd3 f6 {Preparing to connect the Black Rooks.} 34. Nc3 Kf7 35. Nxa4 Rd8+ {Even though everybody has passed pawns, White resigned.}
