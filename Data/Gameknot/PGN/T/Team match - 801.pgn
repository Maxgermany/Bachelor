1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {I have always preferred this line with white after 2... d6, but I suspect it is still very even.} 3. d4 Bg4 4. dxe5 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 dxe5 6. Qb3 b6 7. Bc4 Qd7 8. Nc3 {My Queen feels fairly misplaced here, the pressure on f7 is only transient, and the Queen at b3 serves no other purpose than the possible threat of Bb5.} Nc6 9. Bb5 O-O-O {This seems unwise with the pinned knight when Qd2 and Qd1 are not possible} 10. Qc4 {Adding the pressure on the knight} Bc5 11. b4 Qd4 {The bishop could not be held, but my hand is at least forced here by the mate threat on Qxf7#. Castling loses material to 12... Qxc4 13. Bxc4 Bxb4} 12. bxc5 Qxc4 13. Bxc4 bxc5 14. Bxf7 {Materially white is now comfortably ahead, but I totally missed the rather apparent knight fork - Perhaps I should have left this pawn alone here?} Nd4 15. Bb3 c4 16. Bxc4 Nxc2+ {Seems that exchanging a pawn for the rook is the best I could get, especially as I felt sure of being able to pin the knight in.} 17. Ke2 Nxa1 18. Be6+ {Maybe Bd3 was better, allowing me to free the c1 bishop and capture the knight. I saw some nasty traps on the king with the open b file and thought I would try to force something more profitable.} Kb8 19. Bg5 Rd6 {All of a sudden the iniative is back the other way, and I cannot easily prevent Nc2. My only option is to play 20. Rb1  and hope that black plays 20... Ka8 with 21. Bd5  to follow.} 20. Rb1+ Rb6 {Black doesn't fall for it, and forces white to spend a number of moves taking the knight at a1} 21. Rxb6+ axb6 22. Kd2 h6 23. Bh4 Nf6 24. Kc1 Re8 25. Bd5 g5 26. Bg3 h5 {I expected 26... Nh5 here, as I think it is in black's favour to take one of my knights off the board. This seems to help white slightly.} 27. h3 h4 28. Bh2 g4 29. Kb2 gxh3 30. gxh3 Re7 31. Kxa1 {A number of horrible forced king moves comes to an end for the time being} Nxd5 32. Nxd5 {This seems a nice place to have the knight -- perhaps black had expected exd5?} Re6 33. Kb2 Kb7 {Allows c6} 34. Ne3 c5 35. Nf5 {h4 pawn can not be defended} Kc6 36. Nxh4 c4 {Interesting, Rh6 seems to force white to lose a pawn and the iniative, but I think black was trying to simply storm the Queenside with brute force. It was very nearly successful.} 37. Nf3 b5 38. Nxe5+ Kc5 39. h4 {I need a way of preventing Kd4 here, but I cannot see one so I decided to counter-attack on the side instead.} b4 40. f4 Kd4 41. Bg1+ Kxe4 42. Nxc4 {Pawns come off the board, and this game seems to be heading towards a draw.} Kxf4 43. Kb3 Kg4 44. Kxb4 Kxh4 {My only hope is to get the pawn far enough forward to force black to exchange it for his rook, and then try to win a complicated B N endgame} 45. a4 Re1 {A final blunder, allowing a bishop fork.} 46. Bf2+ {Annotation for team benefit -- I am aware that my understanding of this game is somewhat limited, so I apologise for any mistakes!}
