1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian defense.} 2. e5 h5 3. d4 c6 4. f4 Bg4 5. Be2 f5 6. Bxg4 {White could also have played exPf5 e.p. though not necessarily better than Bxg4. } fxg4 7. e6 Nf6 8. g3 Ne4 9. f5 Qa5+ 10. c3 Nd7 {Knights actually are more valuable than pawns.  This sacrifice does not help black. } 11. exd7+ Kxd7 12. h4 {Black could play gxPh4 e.p.  Nxg3 is probably better.} Nxg3 13. Rh2 Rg8 14. Rf2 Ne4 15. Rf4 Nxc3 {Knights are more valuable than pawns.  Bears repeating. } 16. Nxc3 g5 {White could play fxPg5 e.p.} 17. Rf2 gxh4 18. Qe2 h3 {Bg7 defends Rg8 from Qe6+. } 19. Qe6+ Ke8 20. Qxg8 Qb6 21. f6 Qxd4 22. fxe7 {Re2 first should protect that pawn.} Kxe7 23. Re2+ {Rf7+ Instead gives white Bf8.} Kd7 24. Qe6+ Kd8 25. Bg5+ Kc7 26. Be3 Qb4 27. Qf7+ Kd6 28. Rd1 d4 29. Bf4+ Kc5 30. Re5+ Kd6 {Rb5# is discovered checkmate.  Kd6 should be avoided simply because white can place the interposed rook anywhere he wants to take a piece, such as at Rb5.}
