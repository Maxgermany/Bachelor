[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian...} 2. f4 {...aborted or what?} d5 3. exd5 Nf6 4. c4 e6 {I found out that black is better here, as development is better.} 5. dxe6 Bxe6 {d2 pawn seems very weak} 6. b3 Qd4 {front and maybe too fast attack. Real goal is f4.} 7. Nc3 Qxf4 8. Nf3 Nc6 {white king is really in a middle of problems} 9. d4 {threatening both Bxf4 and d5. But neglecting the central and dangerous position of the king. What weights a queen in front of a king?} Qg4 10. d5 {Looks like black has to pay, now.} Nd4 11. Nxd4 {better was to take the bishop.} cxd4 {but no... if dxe6, then dxc3} 12. Qxg4 Bxg4 13. Nb5 Bc5 {?! Though I still have a win, I think better was here to o-o-o} 14. Nc7+ Kd7 15. Nxa8 {You can take it; you still lose.} Re8+ {No, not Rxa8: time is the key here.} 16. Kf2 {Kd2 was slightly better.} Ne4+ {I guess this is the one move white didn't see. On 16. ... d3+17 Kg3 was safer. Now, it is forbidden by the knight} 17. Ke1 {better than Kg1 facing two-moves death} Ng3+ {recuperating material, though unnecessary. There was a mate in two by Bb4+} 18. Kd2 Nxh1 {I wonder: maybe was it faster not to take the rook, but I was pointing Nf2} 19. Bb2 {clearing area for the last rook.} Bb4+ {it is almost done. On Kc1, Nf2, and on Kc2 the intermediate move was Bf5+ 20. Bd3 Re2+} 20. Kd3 Nf2+ 21. Kc2 {If Kxd4, then mate in one Re4x} Bf5+ 22. Kc1 Re1# {Thanks for the game to my opponent; I liked it. We have another one that is at least as entertaining as this one. Not finished yet on 25 of January.}
