[Opening "Four knights game (C46)"]

1. e4 {This is a match I had with a player that was 1032. I'm still learning, so any comments about my moves would be great. } e5 {A lot of people say that this move is not a good counter for e4, that c5 and e6 are better. Any thoughts?} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Protecting my king pawn, impeding the d4 push, and developing my knight. This game is textbook so far. } 3. Nc3 Nf6 {All knights developed. So far a mirrored game. } 4. d3 {Doesn't push the pawn all the way. Good job knight on c6!} d5 {Was this a good or a bad move? I think it was good because it opened up the middle. Dunno. What do you guys think?} 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Bg5 {Threatens the queen. I've never liked this move, always thought it put the bishop in danger. Also, this move sets up the game changing pin. } Nf6 {Not the best move, I see now. But it's better than f6, and you'll see why later. } 7. Qd2 {This is a blunder. See how the bishop and queen line up with c1, where the king will be if it castles queen side? This furthers the pin.} Be7 {I see the opportunity, so I line up my queen and bishop for a queen pin. } 8. O-O-O {The blunder I was talking about. If I can take the g5 bishop, I'll be a queen up.} Nd4 {I actually don't know why I did this. But it happened to really help me checkmate his king, so I guess it's a good move. } 9. Nxe5 Ng4 {About to take the bishop. I think that my opponent thought that his queen was protecting it. } 10. Re1 {Gets ready for a discovered check, which would be good in other circumstances. However, now his queen is only being defended by his king. Thus, this is a blunder. } Bxg5 {And the pin is here! Is it good, is it not, answer it in the comments. In this game, it changed who would win. } 11. Nxg4+ {The discovery check I was talking about. It could have actually destroyed me, if he had played Nc6 instead of Nxg4. Then he would have taken my queen. } Be6 {Was this how you would have stopped it? Also, to answer jkarp (thank you for all the comments!), I see that white could have played f4 here and my pin would be gone. Thanks for pointing that out!} 12. Qxg5 {This was worse than leaving the queen there, because now I can put the king in check. He should have played f4 to prevent the pin, and then he'd be up a pawn. } Qxg5+ 13. Kb1 Qd2 {So there are many good moves that this guy could have done. But instead...} 14. b3 {He makes an escape route. Bad idea, because he will never use it. } Qxc3 {Cutting off escape for the king.} 15. Rd1 {It's too late for this move. I don't know what white was trying to accomplish with this move, but now we have a fork, if I wanted to. But I saw checkmate, so I went for it.} Qxc2+ {Here's the fork.} 16. Ka1 Bxb3 {This move wins the game. There is no way for him to get out of checkmate. Rb1? No good, just take a2 with the queen. a3? No, just same Qa2#. And then the obvious....} 17. axb3 {Pawn capture.} Nxb3# {And that's checkmate! So there you have it. A fun 17 move game about the power of pins, why you should never have your queen on d2 when castling queen side, and why bishops on g5 are a bad idea. So if you enjoyed this annotation, leave a comment. Have a nice day!}
