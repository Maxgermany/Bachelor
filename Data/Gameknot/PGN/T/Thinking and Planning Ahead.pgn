1. e4 {The, King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {He decides to open with the, King Pawns Game.  I understand this because I used to open with the Kings Pawn Game, when I was black.  Then, I learned about the Sicilian Defense from Mr. Stockel, and I like it better.} 2. Nf3 {The King's Knight Opening.  This is a transposition of the King's Pawn Opening and the King's Pawn Game.} d6 {He advanced his d7 pawn to protect his e5 pawn.  This is not a blunder, but it is certainly not his best move.  If he wanted to defend his d7 pawn, he should have play 2...Nc6, instead.  That is because he is now pushing his pawns, instead of developing his pieces.  It might cause him to have dark square weaknesses, later in the game.} 3. Bc4 {Although this is not a Ruy Lopez or Guaco Piano, I decided to advance my LSB for development.  Note: it is very important to develop your minor pieces, during the beginning game.  This is the reason that I often play 2.Nf3, when I am white.  For black, the rules are slightly different, if you open with the Siclian Defense.} Nh6 {? This is a mistake.  There are occassions where it is ok to place your knight on the h or a files.  In most circumstances, however, a knight on the rim is grim.  This is not an exception.} 4. O-O {? This move might not be bad, but I left it with a question mark because I used bad judgement.  After all, shamash would say, "". . . Castling. It is supposed to put your king into safety." No. Castling is no protective panacea. You don't just tuck the monarch away and leave him on his own with a few pawns. Every fortress needs protection." I used to disagree with this assessment until I read Grandmaster Natalia Pogonina's article about castling.} g5 {I do not know why he played this move.} 5. d3 {In the meantime, I decided to advance the d2 pawn in order to win a free pawn, and that will happen shortly.} c6 {?? I do not know why he advanced his c7 pawn, but this turns out to be a serious blunder.  5...f6, or 5...g4 would have been better as they would have protected his g5 pawn.  Of all those choices, however, 5...g4 would have been his best move because 5...f6 would create dark square weaknesses, so it would weaken his position.  However, I am going to take a free pawn, when I play 6.Bxg5.  Therefore, I will be a point ahead as he cannot recapture with 6...Qxg5, or 7.BxQ due to my DSB.   I could also capture with 6.Nxg5, but I will capture with my DSB to attack his queen.  That way, he will be forced to retreat his queen, so he will loose an important tempo while I come up with other plans.  What are my plans?  That will be answered shortly.  } 6. Bxg5 Qc7 7. Bxh6 {! Therefore, I decided to take advantage of my gained tempo.  In other words, I decided to use my extra move, so that I can capture his knight.  This way, I am exchanging his knight for my DSB, after he plays 7...Bxh6.  Note: this is a closed position, so a knight is worth more then a bishop, in this context.} Bxh6 8. Nfd2 {I do not know why I retreated my knight, but 8.b3 might have been something to consider.  Of course, it is not too late as I can still protect my b2 pawn by advancing it, should he play 8...Qb6.  Note: that Qb6 would attack my b2 pawn, so I would have to be careful.  Otherwise, Qxb2 followed by QxN loosing my b2 pawn and b1 knight, at best.  Therefore, I would be a piece behind, instead of a point ahead.  However, I am lucky because he decides to capture my knight with his DSB.} Bxd2 9. Qxd2 {I also could have recaptured with my knight (9.Nxd2), but I decided to take with my queen.  If I retook with my knight, my queen would be a little crammed.  In other words, it would have a little less room to maneuver.  For example, it would not be possible to play Qd2, if 9.Nxd2.  In this position, however, I have more options, with my queen.} b5 {He advanced his b6 pawn, to chase my bishop away.} 10. Bb3 {Therefore, I am forced to retreat my LSB, so I have lost tempo.  However, cedeburca mentioned that some tempo gains can be quite harmful, in a different annotation.  I lost a game by chasing pieces and trying to gain tempos.  That game will be annotated sooner or later.  } h5 {?? I do not know why he chose this candidate or what he is trying to accomplish?  10...f6 would have been his best move.  However, this is a costly mistake, eventhough it is not his loosing blunder.  That will be explained shortly.} 11. Qg5 {! If 10...h6, I would not have been able to play this move.  This will give me a serious strategical advantage, in this position.  That is because I am now beginning to plan a mating assault against him.  In other words, I am trying to figure out an inevitable mating sequence against him.  For that reason, this is where I begin to think way in advance.  In addition, I will be thinking harder throughout the entire game, for every move.  That is, until I finally find an inevitable mating pattern against him.  Remember: I solve chess puzzles, from time to time, and these puzzles will play a role, at the end of this game. } Nd7 {He probably advanced his b8 knight for development, but it does not matter what he does, in this position.  That is because I am going to plan two mating patterns.  First is an immediate mating move.  Second is an eventual mating sequence, if I cannot mate right away.  Both of my plans will require 12.Qg7, so this is where my strategy will begin. } 12. Qg7 Rf8 {! This move was indirectly forced.  In other words, this is where he had moved, or I would have mated him with 13.Qxf7#.  That was, btw, my first plan.  However, my second plan will become a reality, in this game, but other tactics will be required for the strategy to work.} 13. c4 {In this position, I am clearly trying to force an exchange with 13...bxc4 14.Bxc4.  Afterall, I do not mind exchanging material because I am still ahead.  However, I will not be successful because he will protect his pawn with 13...b4.} b4 14. Bc2 {I decided to use another tactic by distracting him.  This move might help to achieve my second plan.  As I mentioned earlier, my second plan is an eventual mating sequence.} Rb8 {I do not know why he moved his other rook.} 15. Qh6 {I decided to move my queen, in order to win another free pawn.  That will be explained shortly, but this is another tactic for my second plan.} f6 {?? I do not know why he advanced his f6 pawn, but this is another serious mistake.  Even if he had not played this move, I was still going to win another free pawn with 16.Qxh5.  Therefore, I would be two points ahead, instead of 1.  On the other hand, his h5 pawn would be pinned, as opposed to being in check.  At this point, I am going to put him in a bad situation with 16.Qxh5+.    } 16. Qxh5+ Rf7 {He decides to get out of check with his rook.  He also could have responded with 16...Ke7, or 16...Kd8.  In my opinion, both would have been a little better.  That is because I am now going to annoy him by placing him in another check with 17.Qh8+.  This is, btw, a, "Scare Tactic", and I used this term, in my last annotation.  } 17. Qh8+ Rf8 {He also could have played 17...Kd8 to get out of check.  However, I believe that he moved his rook to trick me into a three fold repetition.  For that reason, I am not going to use another, "Scare Tactic".  That is because, "Play time is over.  Now, it's time to get serious", as they say.} 18. Qg7 {!! For that reason, I decide to threaten his rook with my queen.  However, this is an idle threat because I cannot play 19.Qxf8+, or 19...Kxf8, loosing the queen and perhaps the game.  I am trying to intimidate him, and that is the reason that I attacked his rook.  In most circumstances, however, I would put a question mark on it because this is normally a blunder.  In this position, it looks bad, but it is actually a solid move and extremely rare.  What makes this a good choice?  That will be explained shortly.} Rf7 {This opponent is not going to be intimidated, so he decides to attack my queen.  } 19. Qg6 {Therefore, I am forced to retreat my queen, so I have lost a tempo.  However, this wasted move will benefit me, in the long run.  In a different annotation, I mentioned that I was able to pin a rook once, and this was that time.  Remember: my first plan did not work, and I am not surprised.  In a different annotation, ION advised me to assume that my opponents will spot the threat.  Consequently, this is where I begin to accomplish my second plan.  In order for my plan to work, his f7 rook must be pinned.  That, however, does not mean that I won't be able to mate him, unless I pin his rook.  Even if the plan does not work, there still might be another way to mate him.  Afterall, "There is always another way to do something", as chesskingdom64 would say.    } Nc5 {I do not know why he moved his knight because it was already developed.  For that reason, I also do not know his plans (what he is planning to do).} 20. Bd1 {Recognize: that his rook is still pinned.  Therefore, I moved my LSB to find the mating sequence.  According to Mr. Stockel, a Queen and bishop are the most dangerous types of attack.  In fact, they involve the most common type of mate.  This is the reason that it is called a Queen and Bishop endgame.  In addition, this is another reason that it pays to become familar with SM.  A scholars mate involves a queen and bishop mate.} b3 {I have no idea why he played this.  However, the game is now lost for black, and I will be explain this concept shortly.} 21. Bh5 {Although I do not have an official mating pattern, a mate is now inevitable.  In other words, this is the official start to the execution of my second plan.  Therefore, I will mate him in several moves, and there is no way around it.} Nxd3 {He decides to capture because he thinks that he has won a free pawn, but that is not going to stop my second plan.  In fact, I will have an official mating pattern after 22.Qg8+, and that will be explained momentarily.} 22. Qg8+ Ke7 {In this position, 22...Kd7 was his only other move.  It does not matter, either way because I will mate in two with 23.Qxf7+, Kd8 (forced), 24.Qe8#.} 23. Qxf7+ Kd8 24. Qe8# {When you are playing a game, it is very important to think, "well in advance", not just one or two steps.  This is what will make you a better chess player.  According to Mr. Stockel, you should think at least 6-10 steps ahead, or you will not play as well.  }
