1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 {This is my first annotation for the knights of honor coaching project. This is a strange variation of the grand prix attack used very rarly in high level play. Its tactically very sharp and white in particular has to be very careful since he has sacrificed his queen.} 7. Bxf7+ {This is the best move for white. Nxf7 would be wrong because of Qd4} Kd7 8. Be6+ {There are perhaps two options Ke8 or Kc6. I chose Kc6 since it seems to be the most popular reply.} Kc6 9. Bxg4 {White recovers material for his queen.} e5 {There are two options for black to activate his bishop. e6 and e5 both seem quite common. White would lose his knight if he captured the e5 pawn. If the pawn were on e6 instead Nxe6 would be a mistake because of Qh4+.} 10. Nf7 Qf6 {Perhaps Qh4+ then exf4 would have been better. Qxg4 would be a mistake because of Nxe5+ forking king and queen.} 11. Nxe5+ {Perhaps Kd6 followed by Qxf4 is better.} Kc7 12. Nc3 {Leaving the king where it is leads to Nd5+ losing the queen. Moving the king to b6 also leads to the knight moving to the same square. Moving to d6 now loses to Nxe4+} Kd8 13. Nd5 {Moving the queen to h6 or d6 leads to a fork of the king, queen and rook by Nf7+ There are no safe places for the queen. Qa6 stops immediate capture.} Qa6 14. Nf7+ Ke8 {15.Nc7+ Kxf7 16.Nxa6 Nxa6. This is the line I expected. However white has other ideas. He can win my rook and lose nothing.} 15. Nxh8 Qd6 16. Be6 {Qxe6 would be a mistake because of Nc7+ so I develop a piece instead.} Na6 17. f5 {The bishop is no longer protected so white plays f5.} Nc7 {The game is already over I can't think of a better move white has all the initiative.} 18. Nf7 Qc6 19. Ne5 Qd6 20. Bd7+ Kd8 21. Nf7+ Kxd7 {No chance of avoiding the loss of the queen. White is simplfying in order to increase his material advantage.} 22. Nxd6 Kxd6 23. Nc3 c4 24. Nxe4+ Ke5 25. Ng3 Bc5 26. b3 cxb3 27. Bb2+ Kd5 28. axb3 Re8+ 29. Kd1 g5 {Not the best move since the white pawn on f5 becomes a problem later.} 30. Re1 a6 31. Ne4 Be7 32. f6 Bd8 33. Ra4 Ne6 34. Nxg5 h6 35. f7 Re7 {Although the pawn is threatening to promote white is really heading for checkmate.} 36. Re5+ Kc6 37. Rc4+ Kb6 38. Nxe6 Rxe6 39. Bd4# {The game is now over}
