1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 {Queen's Pawn Gambit, Chigorin Defense. } 3. Nc3 {...Janowski Variation. } Nf6 4. Nf3 {That doesn't stop d5xc4.} dxc4 5. e4 Bg4 {I kind of like b5 here instead.} 6. Be3 e6 7. Bxc4 {Long time coming.} Bb4 8. O-O {Castling gives black Pe4.  Maybe Qc2?} Bxc3 9. bxc3 Nxe4 10. Rc1 O-O 11. Bf4 a6 12. Qd3 Bf5 13. Qe3 b5 14. Bd3 Qd5 15. Rfe1 Nxf2 {?  There is nothing free about that pawn, provided KxN.  Otherwise black gets white's bishop.  Or, better yet, BxB.  QxB, KxN.  Cannot use the queen, or Bf4 is undefended.  White also must watch out for Nd3, which forks the rooks.  Only the queen is protecting it.} 16. Bxf5 {:)} Qxf5 17. Kxf2 {I am quite the seer.} a5 {BxPc7?} 18. Bxc7 b4 19. c4 a4 20. Rcb1 Qc2+ 21. Qe2 Qc3 22. Be5 {Mm, I think I like Bd6 better.  Black moves the rook, Pd5 pushes the knight culminating with BxPb4.} f6 23. Bd6 Rfd8 {This leaves Pe6+ undefended.} 24. c5 Nxd4 25. Nxd4 Qxd4+ 26. Qe3 Qxe3+ 27. Rxe3 b3 28. axb3 a3 29. Ra1 a2 {White can focus two rooks on this pawn and take it.  Black should develop something else, such as protecting e6.} 30. Rxe6 {Too late.} Kf7 31. Re2 Ra3 32. b4 Rb3 33. Rexa2 Rxb4 34. Ra2a7+ Kg6 35. c6 {The bishop is lost.  BxB, Pc7, Rc6 (or Rc4), white loses the pawn too.} Rxd6 36. Rc1 {...or that.} Rd8 {I like Rb8 better, which locks down white's c rook.} 37. c7 Rc8 38. Ke3 Kf7 39. Rd1 Rc4 40. Rd7+ Ke6 41. Rxg7 h5 42. Ra6+ Kf5 43. Ra5+ Ke6 44. Rxh5 Rc8xc7 45. Rg6 Ra7 46. Rhh6 Ra3+ 47. Kd2 Rf4 48. Rg3 {Here RxR, PxR, Rf2+ gives back another pawn, tying up the game.} Rf2+ {Whoa!  Nothing is defending Ra3!} 49. Ke1 Rb2 {The proper move here would have been RxR or Rf2a2.  RxR would help black protect its remaining pawn.} 50. Rxa3 Ke5 {Pg2 was a free pawn, why move the king?} 51. Ra4 {Ok, what does white have against Pg2?  I mean, Ra6 at least picks up black's last pawn.} Rxg2 {}
