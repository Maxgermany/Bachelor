[Opening "Sicilian (B22), Alapin's variation (2.c3)"]

1. e4 {I am annotating this game for a member of my team, so I will only mention black moves which I feel are significant} c5 2. c3 {A variation on the main line Ng3, a useful variation to aviod the main Sicilian line, which is the most played opening on Gameknot, as well as tournament level play, and can get repetitive.} d5 {A move which can cause black problems despite white being unable to play Nc3 to attack the queen} 3. e5 {Better would be exd5, to open the centre, as black's queen would still be developed too early} f6 {White's centre is vulnerable, black would be better of playing Nc6 to attack the pawn, continue development and slow white down by forcing him to defend it} 4. f4 {d4 is a better alternative} Nc6 5. Nf3 Qa5 {Black decides to develop his queen too early anyway. You should refrain from developing the queen until you have pieces to back it up} 6. d3 {Again, d4 would be better, this move is too passive, allowing black the chance to achieve equality} Bg4 7. Be2 {This pin risks whie losing his e5 pawn, if he had originally played d4 this would not be an issue} e6 8. Bd2 Bxf3 9. Bxf3 fxe5 10. f5 exf5 {Black willingly weakens his own pawn formation, better would have been to give up the pawn to weaken white's initiative} 11. Bxd5 {White is down a pawn without significant advantages for his sacrifice} Qb5 12. Qc2 Nf6 13. c4 {Better would be Na3, Qa6, Bc4 still controlling d4 without weakening white's pawn structure.} Qb6 14. Nc3 O-O-O 15. Bg5 {This simply forces black to develop a piece he would have anyway, better would be 0-0} Be7 16. O-O g6 17. Qe2 Nb4 18. Qxe5 Nfxd5 19. Bxe7 Nxe7 20. Qxe7 {White's queen is well placed, however without backup it will simply be chased back} Nxd3 {White is still losing due to being a pawn down} 21. Nd5 Qd6 22. Qe2 Ne5 23. Rad1 Kb8 24. Nf4 Qe7 25. Rd5 {Better would be Nd3, threatening a queen trade-off to weaken black's attack as well as winning the c pawn} Nc6 26. Ne6 {A needless attack causing white to fall even further behind. A trade-off of queens would help white equalize, after Qxe7, Nxe7, Rxc5 and white has managed to win back his pawn, with equality} Rhe8 27. Rxd8+ Nxd8 28. Qe3 {Again white had the chance to trade-off the queens and win the pawn via Qe5  Kc8 Qxc5 Qxc5 Nxc5 and white should be able to draw without trouble} Nxe6 29. Re1 Kc8 30. Kf2 Kd7 31. Rd1+ {White will simply be forced to move it back with a loss of tempo} Nd4 32. Re1 Nc2 33. Rd1+ {One last chance to equalize, white could have played Qd2  winning black's Queen for a Rook, he would still be down a pawn, but would have a better chance at fighting back.} Kc6 34. Qd3 Nd4 35. Kg1 Qe2 {Black quickly begins to snap up white's pawns, at this point white has lost} 36. h3 Qxb2 37. a4 Qe2 38. Qb1 Qxc4 39. Kh2 Qxa4 40. Qd3 Qc2 41. Qf1 Re2 42. Rc1 Qe4 43. Ra1 Nf3+ {White played fairly well here, with a few mistakes, his biggest was the loss of his e5 pawn, would lead to an advantage for black throughout the game.}
