[Opening "two knights defence (C57), Lolli attack"]

1. e4 {This game is a training match with one of my junior teammates.  If you have any comments or suggestions for improved play, please post so that we can all learn together.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {I distinctly prefer the King's pawn game (C50) to Ruy Lopez (C60), but that's just personal preference.  Regardless, these opening sequences are standard chess fare that every practitioner of the art will run into again and again.} Nf6 {Now we transition to a Two knights defense (C55), which is a very popular defense and my preference as well.  In this match, considering the difference in our ratings, I wanted to play very aggressively to see how my opponent would respond.  I feel that aggressive chess tends to open learning opportunities more quickly.} 4. Ng5 {Again, very common play so far.  This attack can be precipitate some bad things on the f7 pawn if left unattended.  In addition to threatening a double attack on the f7 pawn, it also defends the e4 pawn from immediate capture.} d5 {Perfect response from Black.  It blocks the LSB on c4 and threatens the center.} 5. exd5 {preserving the momentum of the attack.} Nxd5 {Recapturing the pawn and threatening my knight on g5 at the same time.  Although my preference as Black is to play Na5 here, this line is perfectly playable and a strong response.} 6. d4 {This move seeks to protect the knight on g5, and keep the pressure on Black.  Another sequence I sometimes play is 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+, which makes Black's king move around the board.} Nxd4 {I expected either exd4 or Be7.  Another strong option is Bb4+.  Although this play isn't bad, whether it's good or not depends upon the follow through.  It does provide possibilities if I can't counter punch.  Although I still have two attack pieces on the board, Black has better development and more center control.} 7. c3 {This move will normally cause Black to retreat and allow me a tempo move.  A strong response, however, is b5, offering some tantalizing counterplay.} Ne6 {Black decides on a 2-1 play against my knight on g5.  Not a bad play at all.  So far my opponent is doing well in keeping up with my attacks and has shown good positional play.} 8. Qxd5 {Now I have some firepower downrange and am about to seriously start threatening Black's position.  Black has a few choices worth considering, but I think the best move is to trade queens.} Nxg5 {And with this move Black has lost on the exchange.  While trading a piece for a pawn early isn't the end of the world, without a clear tactical or positional advantage to press as a result, the exchange would appear unwise.} 9. Qxd8+ {Forcing Black to lose castle and removing the defender from the knight on g5} Kxd8 10. Bxg5+ f6 {A good response, forcing away my bishop and causing me to regroup.} 11. Be3 Bf5 {Black's priority should now be to get his remaining two pieces in play and connect his rooks.  So far so good.  I toyed around with f4 here for a while, but ultimately decided to castle and complete my development.} 12. O-O Bd6 {Protecting his King and allowing the possibility for a manual castle or at least connecting his rooks.} 13. Nd2 {Completing my development.} a6 {Denying me access to the b5 square with my Bishop.  Not necessarily a high priority.  I might have moved my king to either d7 or e7 to link my rooks, or played c6.} 14. a4 {Looking to explore the queenside pawns for trading and opening a hole for my rooks.} Kd7 {Now Black is linking his rooks.  a5, to halt my pawn's progression, should have been strongly considered.} 15. b4 {Now I've got a more developed attack on his queenside and without his pawn at a5, it makes it a little more difficult to respond, but not impossible.} Rad8 {While rooks love open files, there is an impending attack on Black's queenside.  Better to keep your rooks there, or potentially add one, so that you can help defend.  Another strong consideration is b5.  No matter what I do then, Black can lock up pawns, rather than allow me access.  Another move to consider is a5.  While I like b5 a lot better, a5 will stunt the attack by disconnecting my pawns if I take and lock things up if I don't.  I consider this move a mistake, but not quite a blunder.} 16. Nb3 {Looking to stack an attack on Black's queenside, going after his pawns.  Now it's a lot harder for Black to deflect an attack.  Since Black moved his rook away (why?) he can also no longer do a b6 push to limit my attack's effectiveness.} Kc8 {A blunder in my opinion.  Although completing his manual castle, again, Black ignores the danger bearing down on his position.  It would have been stronger to bring some rooks back for the defense.} 17. b5 {Now the building attack is unleashed.  Note that with the knight on the b3 square, Black can't just push his pawn to a5 and then lock things up.  Now no matter what I can punch open a hole on Black's queenside pawn structure, where I have three pieces in the immediate vicinity and the potential for 2 rooks to add a lot more weight.} Bc2 {An interesting response by Black.  This move is designed to force me to remove the knight from threatening the a5 square, so his pawn can advance and thus tie up his queenside and provide a much greater safe haven for his king.  On the surface it's a good plan, but the execution isn't perfect.} 18. bxa6 {The attack bears fruit in successfully punching a hole.  Black's king is a lot more exposed and isolated now.} Bxb3 {Gaining temporary parity in points and potentially getting a pair of split pawns.  While not perfect, that would be better than what happened.  The better play is bxa6, thus ensuring your end state.  The order in which we make our moves matters.  As you are learning chess, explore possible responses from your opponent to make sure that a surprise check doesn't ruin your plans.} 19. axb7+ Kxb7 {Another option (which I haven't played out) worth considering is Kd7.  It could then be followed up by c6 giving you multiple options to defend the promotion, but with my pair of bishops to your one, taking with the king might still be best.} 20. Rfb1 {Now Black's bishop is pinned against his king and he is a lot more exposed to danger.  While castling and linking rooks is important, once you have connected your rooks, you don't need to artificially move the king to the other side just because it looks more "normal."  Black already had connected rooks and his inattention to my mounting attack spelled his doom.} Kc8 21. Rxb3 Kd7 {the instincts are good to get his king out of there and get his pieces back into the game.  Although Black is down a whole piece, this game is not yet lost.  Remember, if you trade even until the end of the game, it becomes a draw.  You are likely going to have to trade a piece for the a pawn, but once you're in this position, focus your attention on stopping the pawn march.  If you don't, you lose.} 22. a5 {I still have two bishops that I can bear down on the back ranks and no reason not to move that pawn down and make life uncomfortable for Black.  He needs to get both rooks into the game quickly.} c6 {At first I was curious about his move, then I saw the sense behind it, denying the LSB to threaten the main diagonal.  However, it would have been MUCH stronger to get his rooks into play.  They are going to become a liability soon if they just sit there.  I consider this move a blunder.} 23. a6 {No reason to stop until he makes me.} e4 {A wasted move and another blunder, but Black's fate is almost sealed anyway.  Perhaps Ra8 would have been better.} 24. Rb7+ {My LSB forces him to move to e8 or block with and likely lose his bishop on c7.} Ke8 25. Rd1 {Now things are uglier for Black, as the noose tightens.  No matter what he does the game is hopeless at this point.} Be7 26. Rxd8+ Kxd8 27. a7 Ke8 28. a8=Q+ Bd8 29. Bf7+ Kf8 30. Qxd8# {Although an early trade of a knight for a pawn wasn't disastrous in and of itself, the real killer was Black's inattention to the queenside attack.  Please add your comments so we can all improve together.}
