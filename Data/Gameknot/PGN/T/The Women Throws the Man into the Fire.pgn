[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Smith-Morra gambit, Chicago defence"]

1. e4 c5 2. d4 {The Smith-Morra. One of several playable openings against the Sicilian. Though, from experience, I can tell you that it is probably not the best option. The main line leaves white a pawn down for rapid development and center control, which can effectively take down weaker players and players that do not often play the Smith-Morra. Fortunately, I have played several games with this opening; both using it and against it, so I have a knowledge of how to catch up to the opponent before he or she launches a powerful attack. } cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 {This is the main line and you can see how my opponent may move all of his or her pieces out  into a good position, excluding the rooks, leading to a rapid development.} Nc6 5. Nf3 e6 6. Bc4 {Typical move set, that really isn't offensive enough. I think these moves are a bit too passive, but perhaps it is because I play too much offensively based games.} Nf6 7. Qe2 {Passively setting up for a little coup de grace for my minor pieces.} Bc5 8. Bg5 Qa5 {It's not a good one at that, though.} 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. O-O Qc7 {I believe this is pretty useless, but all the other moves are just as adequate. } 11. Rac1 {I don't understand this move either. It sets up only a poor attack. Rad1 seemed a better move.} Qf4 12. Bb3 O-O {Castling into vulnerable space usually is a horrible choice, but in this case it sets a good offensive and an attack on the king is unattainable at the moment, but regardless, it may be a weakness in the endgame.} 13. g3 Qg4 14. Kg2 Qg7 15. Nb5 d6 16. Rfd1 Rd8 17. a3 {I am puzzled by what this is supposed to accomplish.} Rb8 18. Ba2 a5 19. Nd2 {My opponent seems to have a bit of problem with his knights. } b6 20. Nc4 Ba6 21. Ncxd6 {? This is a mistake at the least. My opponent loses at least 2 points in material.} Nd4 22. Rxd4 {This loses less than the alternative, which is to lose a knight.} Bxd4 23. Qf3 {This is another mistake, losing a pawn. It seems my opponent is starting to slip.} Bxb2 24. Rc7 {Trying to force down my defense and attack my king and queen.} Bxb5 25. Nxb5 {A Simple Exchange.} Qg5 26. a4 Be5 27. Ra7 Rd2 {Slowly setting up an attack against White King, while also threatening several minor pieces in the meantime. It's a good strategy, but you have to make sure your opponent does not strike first. } 28. h4 {This move isn't necessarily good, as it lowers defense with the king, but it does make the rook vulnerable.  } Qg6 29. Bb3 Rbd8 30. Bc4 Rc8 31. Bb3 Rcd8 32. Bc4 Bd4 {Okay, I get this was a mistake, but I was not going into a draw by repetition .} 33. Nxd4 Rd8xd4 34. Bb5 Qxe4 {I was able to snag a extra pawn off the exchange, though.} 35. Rb7 Qg6 36. Be8 {This move really screwed him up. A dangerous gamble, that though at first glance it looks like a good move, it is actually a move that loses pretty badly.} Rd4d3 {Now noticing that the line ahead of him, which is Bxf7+, loses a bishop, my opponent starts stalling the timer.} 37. Qf4 {Hoping this can save him, he goes for a desperate attempt of saving his queen.} e5 {Still desperate for the game not to go any worse, my opponent is about to make a fatal blunder} 38. Qc4 {Thinking that he has outplayed me and I lost my queen, he confidently plays this move. What he doesn't see is his mistake, which leads to...} Qxg3+ {0-1. In the process of saving his queen, my opponent subsequently lets the king die for her.}
