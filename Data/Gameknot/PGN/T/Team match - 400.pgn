1. e4 {I was hoping for a Fried liver.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {This is the Giucco Piano. I could've played many moves such as b4 or the main line which is c3.} 4. O-O {Instead I choose a safer route.} Nf6 {If d6 i would play b4. Captain Evans who invented the Evans Gambit won against McConnell when 4. Bc4 d6 5.b4 and he got crushed.} 5. Nc3 O-O 6. d3 d6 7. h3 h6 {He's starting to copy me.} 8. Qe2 Nd4 9. Nxd4 Bxd4 10. Bd2 c6 11. Bb3 a6 12. a3 {Making an escape square for thr bishop} b5 13. Rab1 Bb7 14. Nd1 d5 15. Bc3 c5 16. Bxd4 exd4 17. e5 Re8 18. f4 c4 19. Ba2 a5 20. Qf2 Nh5 21. Qxd4 {Drops a pawn} Ra6 22. dxc4 bxc4 23. g4 Ng3 {g4 had to be the biggest blunder. The knight has infiltrated and I have made many weaknesses.} 24. Rf2 {If 24. Rf3 attacking the knight  24. ....  Ne2+ forks the king and queens. IT shouldn't be too hard to defeat me after.} Rg6 25. Rg2 Qh4 26. f5 Nxf5 {I didn't take the knight. Why not? I don't even know myself.} 27. Qc3 d4 28. Qxc4 {drops another pawn to launch a discovered attack on my rook.} Bxg2 29. Qxf7+ {He obviously didn't calculate properly.} Kh7 30. Qxe8 Bxh3 {There was a mate on g8 which he obviously didn't see. This was supposed to be his win as his pieces are more active and all my pieces are on the queenside and I can't really defend my queen. I was lucky to win this.} 31. Qg8# {}
