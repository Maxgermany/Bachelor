1. d4 {This is Janet's favorite.  I know from experience because in a consultation game at Chicoboy's Legacy, we were black against her.  And, this was her first move.} Nf6 {Back in the day I expected the QG because I generally play 1...d5 and await 2.c4.  But, the reason for not being surprised here is the discussion at Chicoboy's Legacy Club, as well, during that consultation game.  It's not a mistake, but the most common move in the world database is what Charles played.  And, as we discussed, it normally doesn't matter.  But, against opposition of this strength, one small thing could lose the game.  So, the idea is to not deviate from the mainlines here, as discussed there.} 2. Nf3 {Likewise, Janet is, I believe, thinking along the same lines.  She develops and prepares for the Colle's System because this is played first.  And, 3.e3 follows.} g6 {All part of the mainlines since, as GM Susan Polgar once noted black fianchettos in this opening.} 3. c4 {To my surprise, Janet decides to not play the Colle's System, afterall.  I say this because 3.e3 would've been my move.  But, this being played takes me out of unfamiliar territory, and thus, better for learning purposes.  That's due to what I learned with Kenneth_fiore_3.  As the idea is trying to get more used to different openings.  The reason is because Ken play's openings that people say aren't good, just like with TA.  So, he plays that and wins because the opponent underestimates what appears to be weak, or as Ken calls it frowned upon.  } Bg7 {The main follow up to the fianchetto as Charles has nice long flank.  And, yes, I would've played this for that exact reason.} 4. g3 {Likewise, Janet fianchettos.  And, not to my surprise, Charles will castle, after which, white will get nice flank, as well.} O-O 5. Bg2 d5 {And, it gets interesting as Charles advances his center pawn.  In doing so, an interesting exchange will occur.  Then, Janet will use her opportunity to castle, as well.} 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. O-O Nb6 {I was surprised to see this played, though.  As black, I would've been more aggressive by developing another piece with 7...Bg4  But, this has to be a better outpost for his N.  Maybe, Charles has plans to play ...Nc4, at some point.} 8. Nc3 {Having had advanced the c pawn, Janet continues with her development.  Believe it or not, we're thinking along the same line because this is also what I would've played and for the same reason.} Nc6 {But, this move shocks me since Charles did not advance his c pawn, after having had played 5...d5  Therefore, just like his last annotation, this is another exception that I'm trying to puzzle.  But, I do know now.  I thought the plan was ...Nb4 because it looks, somewhat similar to what he noted.  The real plan, however, is his 9th as it involves his N jumping which makes as this is where I think about what I learned from tactical-abyss about the N visualization count.  And, what that boils down is where it travels and what roles they play, and how this makes them powerful.} 9. d5 {As this is played.  That's why the last move would've appeared to have been an inaccuracy.  But, given that stronger players see things that people like me don't see, I'm sure that Charles had planned this, let alone see it.  As now, it'll move.  And, despite it being on the rim, it'll be on a more powerful square, as it appears.} Na5 10. Qc2 {I am not sure why Janet played this.  But, I know that there's something she wants to do with her Queen.  My guess is to mobilize and get it ready for action.  Of course, I don't see it, but there's got to be a complicated variation that would make it powerful.  I say this because I would've prepared for a discovered attack with 10.Bd2.  The one thing for sure is that Janet gives him that center pawn which Charles take.  From there, it gets more interesting and more educational.} Nxd5 11. Rd1 {Of course.  As elyhim pointed out in one of his annotation, which is a well known fact, one of the things you want to do is centralize the Rook.  What's more is Charles Nd5 being pinned.  And, the worst part is that there is no way to break it.  That is where we're seeing white's true colors from this perspective.  As now, this pin also poses as direct threat.} c6 {So, as Charles has noted in his annotations, he protects, as well here.} 12. Ne1 {I'm surprised to see Janet undevelops.  Since I generally don't see the point of undeveloping; combined with Ken's comment in Charles most recent annotation about a move that does it, I understand here.  There is a more active and powerful square for the N.  I just don't which one for it to jump.  But, time will tell.} Bd7 {Not to my surprise, not only does this complete development.  But, the main reason for playing it is because it breaks the pin.  So, although Charles defended accurately, Janet is going to win the pawn back, not surprisingly, as that sac appeared to be a gambit.  Though, if that's true, then just QG, it wasn't a true gambit since white is going to get a pawn back. } 13. Nxd5 cxd5 14. Rxd5 e6 {And, with Charles hit's the Rook.  When Janet retreats, black will attack the Queen, afterwhich, white will her Queen (put it directly behind the Rook) which is typical during the late phases of the midgame, as well as, the endgame.} 15. Rd3 Rc8 16. Qd1 Rc7 {I'm not sure why Charles played this.  But, my guess was to make his Queen more mobile on the eighth rank.} 17. Bf4 {This is where Janet completes her development by launching a nasty attack on blacks Rook.  Not to my surprise, Charles will defend by attacking the B.} e5 18. Rc1 {Although I would've retreated with 18.Be3, I am not surprised that Janet didn't so this.  That's because if 18...exf4, to make long story short, black wins back the piece and places a lot of pressure with 19.Rxd7 as the threat also involves the Queen, and if Charles took to defend it, he'd lose a Rook without compensation.  So, he'd naturally, have to retreat the Queen, but after which, Janet would have more threats.   } Nc6 {As Janet was interested in exchanging Rooks.  So, Charles declines that as he might need it later on, as I learned with Ken about exchanging.  I see the logic behind it.  But, white is ready to exchange by stripping off the N.  I can see why, for afterwards, black is faced with pressure.} 19. Bxc6 bxc6 20. Be3 {Afterwhich, Janet protects her piece.  But, there was a lot going there and hard to keep it up which is why I was trying to break it down from my own perspective, back and forth.} Qc8 {Then comes this move as, similar to white, Charles has his Queen behind the Rook.  And, seeing the position combined with both sides being like this, I know that this is now an endgame and an interesting one, at that.} 21. Rd2 {At first, I wasn't sure why this was played.  But, seeing how it goes down combined with my second lesson with Ken, this gives Janet's Ne1 more mobility which becomes apparent on her next move.} Be6 {However, I do not know why Charles played this.  As black, I would've played 21...e4 to give black's Bg7 more mobility.} 22. Nd3 {This was the plan behind 21.Rd2 since the Rook was in the same spot before that was played.} f5 {I believe that Charles is aiming to attack the N, but with a pawn chain since ...e4, at any point would do that, in a position like this.} 23. Qa4 {But, this move, however, appears to stop that as Charles won't attack the N.  But, I think that had something else been played, he would have, as that's how I think.  So, I believe that the idea behind this move was attack black's Q side since the Queen appears to be better placed then earlier.} Bf7 {Just like before, I have no idea why Charles played this as it appears to give his monarch less options.  For example, he can't 24...Kf7, whereas, it was possible earlier.  But, there is as usual things in games like this that I don't understand when we reach a difficult position.} 24. Rcd1 {But, I'm not surprised to see Janet doubling up as that is a common and important theme in chess.} Rd8 {Charles responds by putting pressure on whites Nd5.  And, with it seeing that is defended more then attacked.  With that my inference is that black speculates that he's lost but is attempting to get counterplay.  If my instincts are correct, that is a good thing to fight for and shows that like his rival here, Charles is also (as he said with penelope80) a tough cookie.} 25. Nc5 {The plan is a little more apparent since Janet's Nc5 is now on the same diagonal as her Be3.  White's target is Charle's a7 pawn.  The idea is to exchange Queens, followed by attacking the Rc7, so that, when black protects it, she can grab a7 and win a pawn.  Or, that's what Charles might have thought, as I did to, until white's next move.  But, the real plan is to get the Queen by checking on d8.  And, it must be admitted that I would've overlooked this to.  I was thinking along the same lines as Charles.} f4 {?? I believe that this was his only mistake.  But, with stronger opposition, as Tom told me, it only takes one mistake.  That's because similar to my last game with easy19, moving the Rook off of the d file would've prevented what's to come.  And, in that case, I wreckon that black would still be in the game.  That's the only reason that I gave this move two quieries with stronger players.  As I felt that this game was drawish until this move.} 26. Rd2xd8+ {But, that's because with those doubled Rooks (which are known to be dangerous for reasons like this) Janet is going to win Charles Q.  And, there is nothing that black can do about it.  Consequently, he resigned.  Overall, I absolutely enjoyed going through this game, and do get what getoverit was telling me.  That's because along the way there is plenty to learn by watching players that are a lot longer and seeing how it's really done. }
