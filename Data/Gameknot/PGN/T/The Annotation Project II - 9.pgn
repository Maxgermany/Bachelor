1. f4 d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ {The thematic position.} Ke8 {Unusual reply, but Black isn't interested a draw.} 9. Bxg4 Bh6 {A new plan.} 10. Ne6 Qd6 {The idea is that Black is going to try and hold the position, developing very carefully.} 11. O-O Nd7 12. f5 {White would like to see Black play gxf??, Bh5++. But Black continues to develop.} Nf6 13. Bh3 Rf8 {Black is willing to give back the exchange to eliminate the active N. } 14. Nc3 Rf7 {Black tries to build a protective force around the king.} 15. d4 {White takes advantage of the position of the Black bishop to get the pawn to d4, but at the price of a piece exchange.} Bxc1 16. Raxc1 c6 {Blocking d5.} 17. Rce1 {Now, White is finally threatening Black's advanced e pawn.} Rb8 {? An immediate Qb4 is better. But the idea here is to prepare for freeing action on the Q side.} 18. fxg6 hxg6 19. Ng5 {? This idea is flawed. Black gets too much play by taking the d4 pawn.} Qxd4+ 20. Kh1 Qb4 {Black is willing to sacrifice the exchange for action on the Q side.} 21. Nxf7 Kxf7 22. Reb1 Kg7 23. Rfd1 Rh8 {Black begins to assert pressure.} 24. Be6 Qc5 {The plan is to exploit White's king position and threaten Qe5.} 25. g3 {This doesn't stop the threat.} Qe5 {White resigns, since the g pawn is pinned and to prevent mate, the bishop must be sacrificed.}
