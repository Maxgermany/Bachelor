1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 c5 {This is a semi tarrash setup. Black will end up with a isolated d-pawn. The theory is that this pawn is more of a liability than a assets. Of course that all depends on who you are talking too. Some players do like the isolated pawn because if it can not be effectively blockaded it can be a one man wrecking crew. } 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. dxc5 e6 7. cxd5 exd5 8. b4 {a sharp sortie that invites black into murky waters. If black plays 8. ...Nxb4 then white will win the past d5 pawn. The point of 8. b4 is that black can not afford to allow white to fortify c5. I had this move played against me in a similar position but in that game White did not get much out of it.    http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13695200&fb=1&rnd=0.29218792156024276} Nxb4 9. Bb5+ {Because of 8. ...Nxb4 is that the black knight is a little out of position. Black will have to waste a small tempo in order to get it back into the game. Furthermore, the b-file has been cleared for use by the rook. With the light bishops on d7 b7 becomes an easy target.   Black now has three major weak points b7, d5, f6} Bd7 {? Black does not want to trade piece in a IQP position. The reason why is that as the pieces come off the board the IQP becomes harder to defend. } 10. Bxd7+ Qxd7 11. Bb2 {Believe me there is a point to this move!} Bxc5 12. a3 {got to remove a defender of d5.} Nc6 13. Nxd5 {The start of a three move combo that wins the rook.} Qxd5 14. Qxd5 Nxd5 15. Bxh8 {Rook is won but Black has managed to get some counter play for it. } f6 {a good move that I did not appreciate at the time when I started the combo. It made me question whither or not the rook was worth it.} 16. e4 {the idea is to push the knight to a less ideal square and bring the bishop back into the game via Bxf6} Nc3 17. Bxf6 Bxf2+ {it is strange how it happens but now it is white who has the isolated pawn. One thing this game has really demonstrated is just how weak an isolated pawn really is. They are extremely difficult to defend because you are forced to defend them with pieces. } 18. Kxf2 Nxe4+ 19. Ke3 {putting the king into the centre makes the end game slightly favorable to me} Nxf6 20. Rad1 {preventing the castling} Ne7 21. Rhe1 {These rooks are going to rule the world some day} Rc8 22. Rd6 {elevating the rook and attacking the knight} Nf5+ 23. Kd2+ {Sorry mate but the rook is not yours} Kf7 24. Rd3 h5 {?? a dubious move that makes a nice outpost for my knight. perhaps ...h6 is better} 25. Ng5+ {Thank you very much kind sir!} Kg8 26. Ne4 {when in the endgame trade pieces not pawn! Trading the knights are ideal for me because with all the pawns on the board my rooks are going to have a field day.} Nxe4+ 27. Rxe4 Rc7 28. g3 Kf7 29. Ra4 {provoking a weakness} a6 30. h3 Ng7 31. Rad4 {threatening to fork with a check. } Ke7 32. Rd4d6 {Watch how my rooks tare apart his pawns} Ne6 33. Rb6 Nc5 34. Re3+ Kf7 35. Rd6 Kg7 36. Kd1 {a waiting move} Kh7 37. Rc3 {a pin that is crushing} Kh6 38. Kc2 Rc8 39. Rb6 Rc7 40. h4 Kg7 41. a4 {this may be the slower way to win but it is the safest. I learned for Aleckine and Petrison to methodically improve your position one move at a time. I rarely win games using flashy combos, instead I am like a boa constrictor slowly squeeze the life of you} Kf7 42. a5 Rc8 {This is what happens when you put on the squeeze! you will do anything to just to relieve the pressure. Even giving up a pawn and a rook. } 43. Rxb7+ {After 43. ...Nxb7 44. RxR white has won}
