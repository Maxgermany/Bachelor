1. e4 {One of my best games , let´s see. My regular move e5 , because I like it.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Nc6 to defend the pawn.} 3. Bb5 d5 {opening and attacking , I wanted to get my queen out - possible if he capture my pawn } 4. exd5 Qxd5 {here it is , now the bishop is under attack} 5. Nc3 {great move , defends the bishop and attacks my queen} Qe6 {I had to go back with my queen} 6. O-O h6 {h6 , to make it impossible to move the knight to g5} 7. Re1 {nice move - attacking the pawn } Bd7 {I didn´t realise it , so I moved Bd7 to defend my knight} 8. d3 {after this move I expected Bf4 that´s why I moved g5} g5 9. Bxc6 {I lost my knight no problem - recapture} Bxc6 {waiting for the next step , White is in a better position in my opinion - king in safe , knights out ,... he is dominating now , so i am waiting ...} 10. Nxe5 {that´s not a good move for me ... } O-O-O {I needed to make O-O-O to get my king out of the e-line because of the rock on e1 } 11. h3 {Honestly , I didn´t know the purpose of this move} h5 {my big mistake   ... look } 12. Bxg5 {I need to defend my rock} Be7 13. Bxe7 {equal exchange } Nxe7 14. Nxc6 {good move I don´t have any possibilities , just one to take the knight} Qxc6 15. Rxe7 {It looks like the white is in a better position , but I have a better chance - checkmate in 2 moves} Rhg8 {this is the time when I took the lead in the game , white must block the possible checkmate - he has more solutions...} 16. f3 {Fortunately he did the best move for me...} Qc5+ {check and after that...} 17. Kh1 {I took the rock} Qxe7 {now the game is mine} 18. a3 {that was not a good move, instead , the white could make a better move} Qg5 {checkmate position} 19. g4 {the white is forced to move there} hxg4 20. fxg4 Qe3 {I moved my queen there to take his pawn h3} 21. b4 {another bad move in my opinion} Qxh3+ 22. Kg1 {and from here it is easy} Rxg4+ 23. Kf2 Rg2+ 24. Ke1 Qh1# {It was a good game , I think the white had more possibilities to win and better positions during the game , but finally I was a bit lucky , but also I defend the attacks successfully and finished it with checkmate. nice play}
