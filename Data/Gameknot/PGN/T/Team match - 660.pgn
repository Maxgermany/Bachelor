1. d4 {This team match is probably one of my best games on GameKnot as I have sacrificed 4 times before checkmating my opponent in 24 moves.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 {Nimzo-indian defence, classic variation. } c5 {4. ...0-0 or 4. ...d5 can also be played.} 5. dxc5 O-O 6. a3 Bxc5 7. Nf3 {A very common position. Black still need to develop their knight and white bishop.} b6 8. Bf4 {8. Bg5 can also be played, but I prefer this variation as it is more attacking.} Bb7 9. Rd1 {This simple move turned out to be decisive later on.} Nc6 10. e3 {10. b4 and 10. e4 are possible options.} Nh5 11. Bg5 f6 {Until this moment, the game has been played according to the opening. 11. ...f6 is a possibility along with Qc7. } 12. Bh4 {This move was provocative - the bishop does not look dangerous, but my opponent still wanted to attack it. } g5 {Not the best decision. There was no point in weakening the position of the king simply for attacking a bishop that poses no danger. } 13. Bd3 {First sacrifice in this game. Black are already in a passive position, but my advantage is not yet enough to win. } gxh4 {A mistake. 13. ...Rf7 or 13. ...Qe7 would have been better, but black underestimate the power of white's attack. My opponent has wasted 4 moves attacking one bishop. } 14. Bxh7+ Kh8 15. Qg6 Qe8 {Black immediately try to swap their passive queen for my attacking one. } 16. Qh6 {Evidently, I avoid the change. } Qe7 17. Be4+ {The bishop is moved to e4 in order to keep file D open for the rook.} Kg8 18. g4 Rf7 {Black are left with no options. 18. ...Ng7 would lead to 19. Qh7  and 20. Bg6#. There are other moves such as 18. ...hxg3, 18. ...Qg7 or even 18. ...Nf4, but they all led to my victory. The situation on the board is already hopeless for black. } 19. gxh5 {File G is now open for my attack. This move is much stronger than 19. Qxh5. } f5 {Last attempt to close down the bishop, but it fails. White are in full control. } 20. Nd5 {20. Nd5! - a simple, but elegant move. Black can not take the bishop because they will lose their queen, and the knight is also invincible because of 21. Rg1   Rg7, 22. Bd5  Kf8, 23. Qh8  Rg8 and 24. Rxg8#. } Qf8 {I think the only way to avoid immediate checkmate was by playing 20. ...Rg7 and giving the queen away. } 21. Nf6+ {21. Nf6 ! , the fourth and the last sacrifice. At this stage, I had already planned the checkmate, and so my goal was to move the black rook from protecting g7. } Rxf6 {No other moves left - black must accept.} 22. Rg1+ {Using the king's weakness to full potential. 22. ...Qg7 can not be played now. 22. ...Rg6 would have slowed the checkmate down to 6 moves. } Kf7 23. Qh7+ {23. ...Qg7 now leads to 24. Rxg7  Ke8, 25. Rg8  Bf8 and 26. Qxd7. } Ke8 24. Qxd7# {The finishing touch. Two of my rooks on d1 and g1 are completely devastating. Having only one pawn advantage, white are dominant. Although black have made plenty of mistakes, this game's final is quite good looking.}
