1. e4 {I double-step my king's pawn to free his bishop and my queen...} e6 {...and my opponent single-steps his, with the French Defence...} 2. d4 {...and I double-step my queen's pawn to give her and her bishop more freedom, still keeping with the French Defence...} d5 {...and he does likewise, still with the French Defence...} 3. exd5 {...and I capture it, going to the exchange variation...} Qxd5 {...but he breaks it by recapturing with his queen.} 4. Nc3 {Now I bring out my knight on the queenside to attack her...} Qd8 {...forcing her back to her base.} 5. Nf3 {Now I develop my kingside knight, giving me some control of the centre...} Nf6 {...and he develops his kingside knight to contest the light squares in the centre...} 6. Bb5+ {...and I now bring out my bishop, and decide to check the king...} c6 {...forcing his light-square bishop's pawn out to block...} 7. Bc4 {...so I retreat it one square.} Bb4 {He brings out his dark-square bishop to pin down my knight...} 8. Bd2 {...so I bring up mine to unpin it, and to keep a reasonable pawn structure should the bishop capture...} O-O {...and he castles kingside...} 9. O-O {...so I copy him...} b5 {...and he attacks my light-square bishop with a pawn...} 10. Bd3 {...so again I retreat it one square.} Nbd7 {He now brings out his quenside knight and connects them...} 11. Ne5 {...so I attack the second knight with one of mine...} Nxe5 {...and he captures it...} 12. dxe5 {...so I recapture, and pressure his remaining knight...} Nd7 {...forcing it back...} 13. Qh5 {...so I bring up my queen to threaten a possible checkmate...} g6 {...but his pawn sees to that...} 14. Qe2 {..so I retreat my queen to cover the pawn under threat from the knight...} Qc7 {...and as his queen threatens it even more...} 15. f4 {...so I move up its neighbour to protect it, and regain control over its square...} Bb7 {...and he fianchettos his light-square bishop, no doubt hoping to eventually attack my pawn on g2...} 16. a3 {...so I attack its twin with the pawn in front of my inactive rook...} Ba5 {...so it retreats one space...} 17. b4 {...so I attack with another pawn...} Bb6+ {...forcing it to the only safe square to attack my king...} 18. Be3 {...so I block with my dark-square bishop, in front of my queen...} f6 {...and he moves his dark-square bishop's pawn to pressure mine furthest forward...} 19. exf6 {...so I capture it...} Rxf6 {...and he recaptures with his rook...} 20. Ne4 {...so I attack his rook with my knight...} Rff8 {...forcing it back...} 21. Ng5 {...and I now attack his isolated king's pawn...} Nf6 {...and he moves his knight forwards to a safe place...} 22. Nxe6 {...and I capture his pawn with my knight, forking his queen and rook...} Bxe3+ {...and he now captures my dark-square bishop...} 23. Qxe3 {...and I recapture with my queen. She sure bade her time there, waiting for her bishop to be captured, so she could capture back.} Rfe8 {He moves the wrong rook to attack my knight (if it stayed put) or queen (if it moved)...} 24. Nxc7 {...and my knight captures his queen...} Rxe3 {...his rook captures mine...} 25. Nxa8 {...but I can capture his other rook with my knight...} Bxa8 {..and lose it to the bishop, meaning that I won the exchange by a rook and pawn for a knight.} 26. Rfe1 {Now I line up his remaining rook with one of mine, giving it nowhere to go without being captured. I didn't matter which one I used, did it?} Nd5 {He covers his rook with his knight...} 27. Rxe3 {...so I capture his rook...} Nxe3 {...and he captures mine...} 28. Re1 {...and I pressure his knight with my remaining rook...} Nd5 {...but he moves it out of the way...} 29. Re8+ {...paving the way clear for my rook to advance to the top rank, so I can fork the king and bishop, ending his challenge.}
