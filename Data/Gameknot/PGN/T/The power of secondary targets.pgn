1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  In this game, all looked lost.  I ended up blundering a pawn on the long a8-h1 diagonal very early in the game.  However, Steve's lsb ended up getting traded off later on and his castled position suddenly got very draughty and Glenda seized on it!  She was aided by a trusty steed and both pieces created a persistent mating threat on g2.  It seemed, however, impossible to deliver that coup de grace, until my rooks found a secondary target to distract Steve from the fundamental, primary task of defending his king.  So, how did this all happen?  Well, we start with 1. Nf3 which is the Reti Opening which is what Dynamic Dave played against me in our latest drawn game which transposed into a queen pawn opening.  This becomes more of an English Opening as the game pans out.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. b4 {3. b4 - so, Steve decides to create queenside flank opportunities.} Bg7 4. Bb2 O-O {4. ..... 0-0 - after Steve neutralises Fou Lenoir's power on the h8-a1 diagonal, I decided to tuck Henry away on the kingside.} 5. g3 {5. g3 - and this is definitely an English Opening!} d6 6. Bg2 e5 {6. ..... e5 - a necessary pawn break.} 7. d3 a5 8. b5 c5 9. O-O {9. 0-0 - so Steve does not take my c pawn en passant but chooses to tuck his own king away on the kingside.} b6 {9. .... b6? - Here I overlook a discovery which should have cost me 15 rating points.  Just look at that line up on the h1-a8 diagonal.  Steve exploits this on the next turn.} 10. Nxe5 Ra7 {10. ..... Ra7 - so I am a pawn to the bad, my queen rook looks silly and Steve can put a knight in my pos any time he pleases!  How low can you go, Jo??} 11. Nc6 Nxc6 12. Bxc6 {12. Bxc6 - thankfully the first knight incursion is easily parried, but I must suffer a white bishop in my camp.} Bb7 13. Bxb7 Rxb7 {13. ...... Rxb7 - not for long though.  My position is still dire with that bally pawn minus.  Steve's castled position now looks suddenly rather draughty and equally suddenly, Glenda has her beady eye on the square h3.  Can she get to it and stir up a cauldron of fear for Steve's king?  We shall see.} 14. Nd2 Qd7 15. Nf3 h6 16. Qd2 d5 {16. .... d5 - after a lot of itching and scratching I now decide to relieve my position of cramp.  I just hope this helps.} 17. Qf4 d4 {17. ...... d4 - Steve wanted to pile up on my defensive knight but thankfully I was able to close off the a1-h8 diagonal with my d pawn that Steve declined to take.} 18. Ne5 Qe6 {18. ..... Qe6 - you would never believe that white could cop Old Matey from here with such a commanding position as this, would you?  Next move, however, Steve takes his first step towards perdition.} 19. Nc6 Qxe2 {19. ..... Qxe2 - Glenda gleefully pulls that pawn minus back for me.  The Wicked Witch of the West goes to c1 to defend her bishop, but this allows Glenda to take a second pawn, on d3.  I am now a pawn up, mwhhaaha!} 20. Qc1 Qxd3 21. Re1 Qf3 22. Ne5 {22. Ne5 - Steve's knight retreats to harass Glenda.  However, Glenda wants to get to h3 and she will perform a few ingenious zig zags on her broomstick to get there.} Qf5 23. Nc6 Qh3 24. Qc2 Ng4 {24. ..... Ng4 - suddenly h2 is under the hammer.} 25. f3 Ne3 {25. ..... Ne3 - and now the same applies to g2.} 26. Qe2 f5 {26. .... f5 - I am gonna try and open Steve up a bit further.  Glenda and my knight badly need reinforcements.} 27. Rac1 f4 28. g4 d3 {28. ..... d3 - my d pawn menaces the Witch and tempts her to take it.  If she does, then Old Matey descends down to g2 before you can say "gameknot".} 29. Qd2 Qxf3 30. Bxg7 Qxg4+ {30. ..... Qxg4+ - now Glenda moons Steve's king.  Yup, that monarch is shivering in lack of pawn cover and in Old Matey's shadow.} 31. Kh1 Qf3+ 32. Kg1 Rxg7 {32. .... Rxg7 - I finally recapture on g7.  Now I am in a position to bring my rooks into the firing line.  If one of my rooks ends up on the g file then Steve's king is certainly not long for this world.} 33. Ne5 Qh3 34. Nxd3 {34. Nxd3 - this capture of the d3 pawn leads to Steve's knight being that secondary target.  I now pin it.} Rd7 35. Re2 Rfd8 {35. ..... Rfd8 - now for the pile on.  Either Steve loses his king or his knight.} 36. Rc3 {36. Rc3?? - saves the knight but drops the king.  Glenda now gives the kiss of death.  Well folks, that's all for now.  Hopefully I will have a few more games like this for you to look at.  Until then, bye for now - Joanne.} Qf1# {}
