[Opening "Dutch with c4 & Nc3 (A85)"]

1. d4 f5 {The Dutch Defense.} 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 {Rubinstein variation - A85.} e6 4. Nf3 d5 {Stonewall variation.} 5. e3 {Sort of passive; still solid.} c6 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. O-O O-O 8. Ne2 {White is neglecting his development - dangerous against a man the caliber of Najdorf, but again the defense remains solid.} Nbd7 9. Ng5 {?  The critical blunder!  White is down on development and his King is West of everything, including his defenders.  Najdorf's attack may not seem definitive, but it is sufficient.} Bxh2+ 10. Kh1 {If 10. Kxh2 then 10. .... Ng4  and Black wins the knight by discovered attack.  This allows White to continue to threaten e6 and material gain, but Black is too quick for him.} Ng4 11. f4 Qe8 {Preparing the attack.  White's King has nowhere to go, so a few waiting moves are fine.  Also, this defends against Nxe6 - White's one good attack.} 12. g3 {An escape.} Qh5 13. Kg2 Bg1 {"Sacrificing the bishop in order to continue the attack on White's king." - Garry Kasparov} 14. Nxg1 {Nh3 buys time for Black, but the weakness of the pawn at e3 means that White's position will simply decay until the end.  Other moves are bkunders; Kasparov also notes "[n]ot 14.Kxg1? Qh2#, or 14.Rxg1? Qh2  and 15...Qf2#"} Qh2+ 15. Kf3 e5 {Turning down the pawn allows 16. ... e4  17. Bxe4 dxe4  18. Nxe4 fxe4 , costing White two pieces and dragging the King further into Black's territory.} 16. dxe5 Ndxe5+ 17. fxe5 Nxe5+ 18. Kf4 Ng6+ 19. Kf3 {White's last three moves were the only legal ones.} f4 20. exf4 {If Bxg6 then 20. ... Bg4  21.Kxg4 Qxg3  22.Kh5 hxg6  23.Kxg6 Rf6  24.Kh5 Rh6#; if Ne2 then 20. fxg3  Nf4 21. Bg4  and again, Black wins material.} Bg4+ {A rock and a hard place: the King dies or the Queen dies.} 21. Kxg4 Ne5+ {!  Black has sacrificed all four minor pieces, and now victory is imminent!  The pawn is drawn off, the open file claimed, and checkmate given.} 22. fxe5 h5# {}
