1. d4 g6 2. c4 Bg7 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3 Ne7 5. Nc3 b6 6. b4 Bb7 7. c5 O-O 8. Be2 Nbc6 9. a3 d6 10. cxd6 Qxd6 11. Ne4 Qd7 12. O-O Nxd4 {The white knight at e4 is undefended.  In addition, black's black bishop now has a potential bead on the white rook. } 13. Nxd4 Bxe4 {Knight for knight plus pawn. } 14. Ra2 {White defends against Pc5.  Moving the knight would cost a rook, and white can't launch much of a counterattack at the moment. } Qd5 {The pawn at g2 is history.} 15. Rd2 Qg5 {...or not.  Mate is so obvious and easy to defend against I would have gone for the pawn.} 16. Nf3 Bxf3 17. Bxf3 Rac8 18. Bb7 {White thinks black's rook is better off on b8.} Rcb8 19. Bf3 h5 20. e4 {With this move white could pick off the pawn at c7 with his rook (or the black knight) unless black moves the queen.} Qb5 {I don't see black's advantage here, other than that the queen is not threatened there.} 21. Be2 Qc6 22. Bf3 e5 23. Qc2 Qxc2 24. Rxc2 c6 25. Rd1 f5 26. Rd7 fxe4 27. Bxe4 {This trade nets white the pawn at c6 or g6.} Nf5 {c6} 28. Rxc6 g5 {Out of the frying pan, into the friar.  Or white's black bishop...} 29. Bxg5 Nd4 {The obvious response here is to double tag black's bishop.} 30. Rg6 Rf7 31. Bd5 Rbf8 {}
