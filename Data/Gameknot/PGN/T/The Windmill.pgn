1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {The King's Indian Defense} 5. c5 {A very unusual  move - Chesstempo database has no games with this move} dxc5 {If 6. dc than after 6. ...Qxd1 than White has the choice of either recapturing with the knight, thereby losing the central e-pawn or recapturing with the King, thereby forfeiting the option of castling} 6. d5 {White gains a central space advantage for the pawn} O-O 7. Nf3 c6 8. Bc4 cxd5 9. Bxd5 e6 10. Bb3 Qxd1+ 11. Nxd1 Nxe4 {Clearly not the right plan for White: his space advantage is gone and his position is now two pawns down} 12. O-O Nc6 13. Nc3 Nxc3 {Taking the opportunity to weaken White's Q-side pawn structure} 14. bxc3 b6 15. Bb2 Bb7 16. Rab1 Rad8 17. c4 Rd6 {Preparing to double Rooks} 18. Bxg7 Kxg7 19. Rbc1 Nd4 {With the simple tactical threat of Ne2 but is also a good outpost square for the knight} 20. Rcd1 Rfd8 21. Nxd4 Rd6xd4 22. Rde1 {The difficulty here is finding the best plan for Black to exploit the two pawn advantage} Ba6 {Forcing the Rook to defend the c-pawn thereby vacating the e-file which in turns allows White to advance the e-pawn} 23. Rec1 e5 24. Rc3 e4 25. h3 f5 {Continuing with the idea of advancing the kingside pawn majority} 26. Rfc1 Kf6 {Following the general endgame principle of centralising the King} 27. f3 exf3 28. Rxf3 Rd4d2 {With the idea of Bb7 attacking the g2 square and setting up the "Windmill"} 29. g4 Bb7 30. Rff1 Rg2+ {And the "windmill" begins!} 31. Kh1 Rxg4+ 32. Kh2 Rg2+ 33. Kh1 Rxa2+ 34. Kg1 Rg2+ 35. Kh1 Rg3+ 36. Kh2 Rxb3 {And the "windmill" swept up two pawns and a bishop} 37. h4 {?? - A blunder that leaves Black with a forced mate.  The text shows the quickest route.  But even the "computer chess" of 38. Rf2 leads to mate after 38. ...Rxf2+  39. Kg1 Rg2+ (40. Kh1 Rc2+  41. Kg1 Rxc1+  42. Kf2 Rc2+  43. Ke1 Rb1#) 40. Kf1 Rh3 followed by 41. Rh1# } Rd2+ 38.
