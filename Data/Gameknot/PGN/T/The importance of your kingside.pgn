1. e4 {This is a game that i thought i might annotate because it shows how much it means to keep your king side intact.} e5 2. f4 exf4 {I accepted the kings gambit.} 3. Nf3 Be7 {I'm a wimp when it comes to the kings gambit.} 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nxe4 {if the usual NxN I can play d5 forking the bishop and knight} 6. Bxf7+ {Winning the pawn.} Kxf7 7. Nxe4 d5 8. Nf2 {I would prefer Nc3 if i was white but i guess its personnal opinion.} Rf8 9. d4 Kg8 {Acting as if nothing happened to my king and gaining a nice F file } 10. O-O Bd6 {Pointing my bishop towards his king and giving my f4 pawn extra protection.} 11. Bd2 Qf6 12. c3 {Helping to protect the d4 pawn.} c6 13. Nd3 {Piling lots of presure on my f pawn.} Bg4 14. Qb3 b6 {Proventing Qxb6} 15. Rae1 Nd7 16. h3 {Trying to force my bishop away} Bf5 17. Nf2 Rae8 {Looking for a rook swap off.} 18. c4 Be6 19. cxd5 Bxd5 {Threatening the white queen and also controling a lot of the board (from f7 to a2 and d5 and an important f3).} 20. Qc3 Bxf3 21. gxf3 {White obviously doesn't want to loose there d4 pawn but loosing the d pawn is nothing compared to loosing the protection of his king because even after 21.Qxf3 Qxd4, 22. Bc3 would make whites position look far more superior.} Rxe1 {Making the most of the bad kingside pawn formation. } 22. Rxe1 Qg5+ 23. Kf1 {trying to run away of the danger} c5 {Opting to swap of the pawns and have my bishop on a really attacking square.} 24. dxc5 Bxc5 25. Ne4 {Threatening to swap an important bishop with a worse knight.} Qf5 26. Kg2 {Protecting the h3 pawn.} Qg6+ 27. Kh2 Bf2 {White cant win the bishop because after NxB black has Qg3+} 28. Rf1 Bg3+ 29. Kh1 {If white moved on the g file white may die of checks somehow.} Qf5 {Threatening mate in 2 with Qxh3, Kg1 and Qh2++} 30. Kg2 Qg6 31. Kh1 Nf6 {Stopping perpetual check and trying to get the rook into the attack.} 32. Nxg3 {getting the important bishop out of the attack but gives the queen more to do after Qxg3.} Qxg3 33. Qc4+ {Trying to get the white queen into the game.} Kh8 34. Bxf4 {Winning a pawn but...} Qxh3+ {Losing a better one!} 35. Bh2 Ng4 {Threatening an awful lot! white can't take because Queen or Rook takes rook just wins and also threatens QxB++.} 36. Qe2 {The only move that protects everything} Nxh2 {White still cant take because of QxR.} 37. Rd1 Nxf3+ {White can noly protect the check with the queen but then gets taken with mate. It just shows how important it is to keep your kingside intact.}
