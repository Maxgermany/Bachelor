[Opening "Philidor (C41), Steinitz variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's Defense is the third most common "world" response to the King's knight opening.  I used to play this most of the time as black, though that pawn gets in the way of developing the black bishop. } 3. Bc4 {Steinitz variation. } Nf6 4. Ng5 {Here black (world) generally plays d5, 5. exd5, h6 6. Nf3 e4 7. Qe2 or Ne5...  While black is down a pawn he makes up for it in momentum. } Be6 {Be6 is off book.  The reason is that white trades up a pawn.} 5. Nxe6 fxe6 6. Bxe6 Nxe4 7. Qf3 {Black must defend against Qf7#.  Qe7 sacrifices the knight.} Nf6 {Pretty much the only choice.  Unfortunately, black now loses Pb7.} 8. Nc3 {Well, I would have played 8. Qxb7.  Black would then have had to move the knight, bNd7 or fNd7.  No, bNd7, otherwise QxRa8.  I know some regard the knight pawn as "poison," but if it is I'm not sure how to take advantage of that. } c6 {Black wisely defends Pb7.} 9. Ne4 d5 {White WANTS to move Ng5, and this kind of forces that.  In addition, Pe5 is hung out to dry.} 10. Ng5 {White should be eyeing Nf7, forking black's queen and rook.} Qe7 11. O-O {When I first started documenting this I marked it as a mistake.  But I erased it when white defended the knight.  Black is ultimately able to ward off the queen and take the knight, while the bishop ends up exchanged for the other knight.  In post game discussion black says he still felt at a disadvantage despite the extra piece.} h6 12. Nf7 Rg8 13. Qf5 g6 14. Qxe5 Nbd7 15. Bxd7+ Nxd7 16. Qc7 Qxf7 17. Qxb7 Rb8 {Time to molest pawns.  Black's queen side crumbles.} 18. Qxc6 Rb6 19. Re1+ Kd8 20. Qa8+ Rb8 21. Qxa7 {That pawn will prove pricey.  Once black drives the white queen off the black diagonal, nothing is left to defend Pf2 from being taken to fork the king and rook.  White chose to take pawns over developing pieces.  While white needed to make up for the lost knight, position can be more important than material.} Bc5 22. Qa5+ Bb6 23. Re7 {The proposed rook sacrifice may have been intended to distract black.  While black could trade queens, QxPf2! lets black play BxQa5 at his leisure.} Qxf2+ 24. Kh1 {Black's focus remains on what is most important.  #1.  Can I force mate? #2.  Can I prevent force mate against me? #3.  Can I acquire a high value piece? #4.  Can I prevent the loss of a high value piece? #5.  Development, control of center, pawn promotion... #6.  When in doubt, push a pawn. } Qg1# {}
