1. e4 Nc6 {Black is not challenging the center at all: so White must...} 2. f4 {always liked this better, than d4...} g5 3. d3 gxf4 4. Bxf4 {this is, what we call free development...} e6 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. c3 {we look after the little ones...} e5 7. Bg3 f6 {a very peculiar move...} 8. Be2 Nge7 9. O-O O-O 10. h3 {preparing Nh2: time to rain down on Blacks' Kings' wing...} d5 11. Nh2 Bxh3 {clearly a miscalculation: opening up Whites' Kings' wing is immaterial...} 12. gxh3 d4 13. Bg4 Bh6 {asking for it...} 14. Nd2 Be3+ 15. Kg2 Ng6 16. Ndf3 Qe7 {whatever attack Black is planning, it will be too late...} 17. Nh4 Nf4+ 18. Bxf4 Bxf4 19. Nf5 {the threat is clear: take out Bf4, and then Nh6+...} Qf7 {this move took me by surprise: after Bh5, Black has nothing, not even check; after Nh6+, Bxh6 (forced), Bh5, Qg7+, Kh1, Black is in big trouble after Rg1: so I gambled...} 20. Nh6+ {after Bxh6, Bh5, etcetera: see above variation...} Kh8 {what can I say? I would say, that Black resigns...} 21. Nxf7+ {case closed...}
