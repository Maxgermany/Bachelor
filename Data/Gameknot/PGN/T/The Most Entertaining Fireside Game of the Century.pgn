[Opening "Old Benoni defence (A43)"]

1. d4 c5 {In recent months I've been studying unsound openings to play in tournaments. Lately though, they've started to get boring and also riskier as the rating progresses. I've decided to not play it in tournaments because i'll probably lose every round with them. So i'm slowly going back to theory with the benoni, alekhine's defense, and others i'm still trying to find.} 2. c3 {Dang it, well at least its a draw} d5 {i'm trying to gain the center as well as develop my pieces. another, but boring alternative is 2...cxd4 going into the exchange slav :(} 3. Bf4 {I knew we were going into a system as every person that defends the d-pawn plays either c3, e3, or Nf3 and either go into the colle, london, torre, stonewall, etc...} Nf6 4. Nf3 Bf5 {I wanted to get my light-squared bishop out of the pawn chain before i developed my dark-squared bishop. I don't want to funky bishops at the same time.} 5. e3 e6 6. Bd3 Bg6 {retreating was better than taking since taking his bishop helps white develop his queen.} 7. Qe2 {my opponent wants to push e4 and open up the position, i sadly have to let it happen as there is no way to stop it} Nc6 8. Nbd2 Bd6 {note that push e4 doesn't work because of 9...Bxf4} 9. Bg3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Bxg3 11. hxg3 {I knew it was a draw anyway so i exchanged the bishops and we agreed to a draw.}
