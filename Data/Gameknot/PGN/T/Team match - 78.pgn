[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 2. e3 {Queen's pawn, Stonewall attack. } e6 3. Bb5+ {Nf3 is probably better.  There are not many openings in the database with this move, and the few there are black tends to do quite well.} c6 4. Be2 Nh6 5. g4 Qa5+ 6. c3 c5 7. b4 {In this exchange black ends up a pawn, with the white king again placed in check. } Qc7 {Black would probably be better off taking the pawn, cxPb4.  If white plays cxPb4 in response, black answers with BxPb4+.  Or QxPb4+.  Black ends up a pawn in that exchange.  Here, black drops a pawn.} 8. Qa4+ Bd7 9. Qc2 {Pb5 is interesting.  } cxb4 {PcxPb4 gives black the white queen.} 10. c4 {Pdxc4, Bxc4 gives black NxPg4.} dxc4 11. Bxc4 Bb5 {Here BxBb5+ gives white the black queen.} 12. Bb3 Bc6 13. f3 Qd6 14. a3 bxa3 15. Bxa3 Qd7 {BxBf8 messes up black's king side castle.} 16. g5 Nf5 17. h4 {Pe3 is undefended.  I would expect black to play NxPe3.} Nxe3 18. Qe2 Nf5 {Pd4 is now undefended.} 19. Bc2 {Pd4 is undefended.  Black has a choice of NxPd4, forcing white to move the queen again, or QxPd4, threatening Ra1.} Nxd4 20. Qd3 Bxa3 21. Nxa3 g6 22. Qc4 Nxf3+ 23. Nxf3 Bxf3 24. Qc3 {Down four points white should consider every even trade with care.  Even trades benefit black.} Rg8 25. Rh3 Bg4 26. Rg3 {One move that might be fun for white is Nb5.  Should black be foolish enough to respond with QxNb5, white answers with Ba4, pinning the black queen against the king.  If black makes some other move (besides the king), white can play Nc7+, forking the a8 rook. } Bf5 27. Bb3 Nc6 28. Rd1 Qc7 29. Nb5 Qb6 30. Nd6+ Ke7 31. Qf6+ {Nice.} Kd7 {White takes the black queen with Nc4+ (discovered check with the rook).} 32. Nxf7+ {Nc4+ was immensely better.}
