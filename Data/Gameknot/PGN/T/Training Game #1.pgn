[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {Contesting the centre in traditional fashion.} d5 {Counterthrust.} 2. e3 {Stonewall setup.  Not the most aggressive but easy development to hopefully iniyialise a Kingside attack.} Nf6 {Versatile.  Aiming at centre. Not committing the Kings Bishop yet and leaving c1/h3 diagonal open.} 3. Bd3 {Well, I think I will carry on with plan.  Central development and start aiming at the black Kingside.} Nc6 {OK...Swift natural development..knights before bishops and aiming at the centre...certainly black is playing solid.} 4. c3 {I can't carry on with my development until I prevent Black's knight coming to b4, which is a nuisance as it will dislodge my centrally placed bishop.  I could play a3 or c3 to stop that.  C3 gives the advantage of a retreat square for my bishop and also overprotects d4.  Yep...looks like c3.} e5 {Wow.  Here she comes already!  I didn't even get a chance to play f4, followed by Nf3 and castles.  That's the Stonewall out of the window.  OK...what are my options?  I'm fairly restricted in choices f3/nd2/dxe5/ne2....everything else looks unnatural or suicidal.  } 5. Nd2 {f3 makes me feel a little uneasy with my King looking slightly vulnerable.    Nd2 looks a little better, preparing for f3 in my own time.    dxe5 doesn't look too bad.  I get to keep a solid pawn formation and a strong point for one of my knights on d4.  However, Emma would get to play c5 in short order, chasing away my brilliant knight and then b6 opening up the killing diagonal a8/h1 for her white squared bishop (WSB) onto my castled King if I castle Kingside....not liking that!  How about Ne2?..then probably after retreating my Bishop to c2 following blacks e4 push, I could play Ng3,Nd2,0-0 and f3....Looks like a plan!     mmmmm. hang on..she can play Bg4 which ties me up a bit and then it's difficult to untangle myself.    I might have to play h3 first...Bit slow and against opening principles.  Should be developing pieces asap.  OK...going back to Nd2.  Of course if she takes on d4 I shall retake with the e pawn and I will be very comfy....but she will almost certainly push e4, but I always have f3 later to diffuse things in that area and at least I will have 2 pieces developed if I play it in this order....yep...I think I will play Nd2.} Bd6 {Black is beginning to aim all her bits towards me King.  She is playing very aggressively...I have had considerable success where Black develops routinely and I have been allowed to play f4, then develop my knights on e5 and f3.....this is a different ball game and I don't feel entirely comfortable here.} 6. f3 {The last thing I now want in this situation is Black pushing e4 and semi-locking the centre.  My QB will be hemmed in and virtually out of play, in fact my entire Queenside would be very restricted.  That is such an issue for me that I'm not even considering anything else right now.  I really hate being cramped.  Tactically, I'm not bad so I need to keep the position as open as I can....maybe even work towards castling Queenside and storming the Kings wing with my rooks belching up the g and h files....but She will launch a similar storm on the Queenside....mmmmm! I need to play to my strengths...OK...f3.} Qe7 7. Nf1 exd4 {Whoops!...That's embarrassing.   I didn't much like the alternatives and just didn't see that at all!  I was so absorbed and convinced that Black was going to push e4,   I didn't even go through the stage..'What has changed?'...well it's painfully obvious what had changed...Black's Queen was now on the same alignment as my King!} 8. Ne2 {Oh well lets try and salvage something at least....It's not ALL bad....just 98% of it! I have to at least try to get some compensation by trying to activate my rooks on the e file...even though Iit will be a miracle if I get time to do that! Might just be able to castle long and get a teeny weeny bit of counterplay....might work against a weaker player anyway, but not young Apt I greatly fear.} dxc3 9. bxc3 {Don't like either option much.  If I take with the knight Black will push the d4 pawn lever and I am toast.  There is some compensation in taking with the b pawn to give a little gasping space for my Queens Bishop, strong-point the d4 square and open the b file to activate my rook.    However, there is a lot to do just in order to develop properly.  My knights are misplaced, my rooks are a million miles from being connected and I'm material down } h5 {oh no!...Not on the wing as well!  } 10. h4 {Sorry Emma!...embarrassing.  All chess conventions broken and hurled through the arched window!...Just trying to survive my blunder.  Well, I have to minimise the damage on the wing and definitely can't sit back and wait for Black to open me up with a pawn charge down the h file.  I can't get my King to safety anywhere as there is no shelter.  Maybe on f2 and try to barricade.....but Black's Bc5 then looks highly uncomfortable..} O-O {MMMM..castled Kingside.  Wasn't expecting that....} 11. Kf2 {OK..slim chance of counterplay on the Kingside...although well dodgy with the centre so open....but have to have some sort of plan.  I need to block the b8/h2 diagonal which is causing me much concern.  Perhaps with pawns on f4 and g3.. I think this is of major immediate concern in order to survive.  But my pieces are awful...how did it get so bad?  I think my Queen would be more use on theb1/h7 diagonal and perhaps my knights on d4 and f3....My Kingdom for a few tempi!  } Ne5 {Ouch.  Centralises the knight, attacks my only good Bishop and prepares for c5} 12. Rb1 {Well, I can't afford to waste any more tempi by retreating my Bishop, If I activate my Queens rook at least it will be working on a semi-open file, maybe giving me a chance for some sort of minority attack.  I don't like the thought of Black exchanging on d3 then playing g6 followed by Bf5, but what can I do?...the game was lost on move 7.  If I don't play my rook to B1 now, I may never get the chance again.} c6 {Consolidates and gives room for her Queen to swing onto c7 if needed for a battery along the b8/h2 diagonal esp. pressure on g3 if I try to swing my knights into more active positions.} 13. Bc2 {On one hand I don't want to lose yet another tempo but on the other hand I really need to hang on to control of the c1/h7 diagonal to at least have some token chance on the Kings wing.} Re8 {I need that extra pressure on the e-file like a hole in the head.  I think I need to push e4 pretty soon but first I need one of my knight on g3.} 14. Nfg3 {Maybe I can get up ontof5 with a bit of prep although g6 seems to kill off hopes of activity there.} b5 {Charging down the Queenside.  She could easily overwhelm me there with a pawn storm.  Still, might give me an opportunity to do something over the Kingside, while she's preoccupied.  Whatever, I must activate my pieces sooner than immediately!} 15. Nd4 {Ah!...here is a chance to maybe get rid of one of her pesky Bishops.  If she defends c6, I play Nef5 or Ngf5.} Neg4+ {Oh blast!...Check!...Too wrapped up in my own feeble desperate plans.} 16. fxg4 {No choice.  Have to take or I go even more material down...and my position is shot to pieces either way!} Nxg4+ 17. Kf3 {Into the frying pan!...Have to protect e3.  If 17....nxe3,  18.Qd3 is a possibility with a double attack on e3 and h7+.  If 17....Qf6+,  !8.ndf4,....g6,  19.Qd4!    which eases some of my problems.    Have to try it...cheap shot!   Oh $%Â£!  She also has a free move with the knight because of the sqewer on the Queen.  I did see this earlier but was only thinking of N25, but of course she will probably play nxe3 and I am toast.  I could still play Q d4 but her attack looks 100% fatal.} Qxe3+ {Didn't see that one...but it was all over anyway!  Nice one Emma.}
