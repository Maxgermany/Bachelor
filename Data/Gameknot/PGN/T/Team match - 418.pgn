1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 4. Nf3 e5 5. Bc4 Be7 6. O-O c6 7. a4 {a4 prevent black from making b5.} Qc7 8. Re1 O-O 9. h3 {I know that out team captain does not like this kind of move, but I wanted to play Be3 and did not want to see Ng4.} Nxe4 {A mistake, he did not calculate the variant, white is winning, the best way for black would be exd4 and then put pressure on e4 with Re8 - this kind of game is difficult for black - to get out of the limited space, but normally black wins if he mange to get a good development.} 10. Rxe4 d5 11. Bxd5 cxd5 12. Nxd5 Qd8 13. Nxe7+ Qxe7 14. Nxe5 Nf6 {f6 does not work - or is no better, white play Nxd7 and take the rook - i.e. just exchange pieces and white is up with 2 pawns.} 15. Bg5 {Binding - something I like a lot.} Bf5 16. Re3 Qd8 17. c3 h6 18. Bh4 g5 19. Bg3 Nd5 {Black is getting some activity for his 2 pawns, but the white c and d pawn are very strong.} 20. Re1 Nf6 {I think that Rc8 would hvae been better, it looks like a waste of time to move it back.} 21. Qf3 Bc8 {A mistake, e6 was the right place to put the bishop.} 22. Rad1 a5 23. c4 {White start to move his pawns} Ra6 24. d5 Ne8 {All black pieces are at the back - except the rook on a6, what a strange position.} 25. c5 Rf6 26. Qc3 Ra6 27. d6 {white want to play d7!} Bd7 28. Nxd7 Qxd7 29. Re7 Qxa4 30. b3 Qb4 31. Qxb4 {Black resign, there is no defence to d7 - he will loose at least a rook.}
