[Opening "Saragossa opening (A00)"]

1. c3 {The Saragossa can be quite dangerous as a transposition opening. For instance it is plausible that after d5 or d5 White could play c4 and transpose to a symmetrical English or Benoni respectively with colours reversed. Similarly after e5 a Sicilian is reached, this is why I like to play Nf6 and retain flexibility} Nf6 2. d4 {Going into a more mainstream opening} e6 {c5 is an alternative but in this line it's not actually that easy to prove compensation for the pawn after dxc5 and the pawn can't be quickly picked back up} 3. g3 c5 4. Bg2 d5 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. h3 Qc7 7. Bf4 Qb6 {Bd6 was fully viable but I wanted to see how White intended to deal with the attack on the b pawn. There aren't any tactical resources to give the pawn away thankfully. There are often tricks with Na3 and Nb5 exploiting wk dark squares in d4, d5 openings but the fianchetto of the light squared bishop kills these off} 8. Qb3 Qxb3 9. axb3 {This line is very forcing and gives Black the better pawn structure but White the more active pieces. It gives quite a bit of scope for outplaying though and I didn't fancy a dull game} cxd4 10. Nxd4 Nxd4 11. cxd4 Bb4+ 12. Bd2 {This was a bit of a surprise. White's dark squared bishop looked rather good on f4. I had planned for Nc3, (Nd2, Bd7, 0-0, Bb5 is irritating for White) Bd7, 0-0, a5 with a level game.} Bxd2+ 13. Nxd2 O-O 14. Nf3 Bd7 15. Ne5 Bb5 {The bishop proves to be something of a thorn in White's side from this square whilst the knight isn't doing any damage for the time being although out-posted on e5. } 16. g4 Rfc8 17. Bf3 Rc2 {Now Black picks up some pawns} 18. O-O Bxe2 {This was actually a very weak move and I'm lucky it goes unpunished. ...a6, Rac1, Rac8 was much more accurate as Black can pick up material at his leisure without conceding the c file} 19. Rfc1 {Now I am in serious trouble and play another bad move} Rxb2 {... Rxc1, Rxc1, Bxf3, Nxf3, h6, Rc7, a5, Rxb7, a4, bxa4, Rxa4, Ne5, Ra1+, Kg2, Rd1, Rxf7, Rxd4, would have been the way to steer through the position and stay a pawn up as Re6, Re4 holds thanks to the trick of Rxe6?? Nd7. After Rxb2 I am extremely lucky that my opponent overlooked Rxa7! leaving me in a nasty position. } 20. Rc7 Bxf3 {This move is played with Rxa7! still on the cards which I did actually realise by this point but I was hopeful my opponent wouldn't see this the second time around. In truth, Rxa7, Rf8, Nxf3, Rxb3 is nowhere near as strong as Rxa7 was the previous turn} 21. Nxf3 Rxb3 22. Ng5 h6 23. Nxf7 {Thanks to White missing the tactics Black now has a win just by pushing the queenside pawns that I still manage to nearly throw away} a5 24. Nd6 b5 25. Nb7 a4 26. Nc5 Rc3 {Rxh3 was much better as now White could have been problematic with Rb7 When Ra5, Nxe6, Ne8 gives White a chance of fighting back} 27. Nxe6 {This was the point when I had played Rc3 though. I'm happy to give a pawn back for a won position} Rxc7 28. Nxc7 Rb8 29. Na6 Rb6 30. Nc5 Ne4 {Rook endgames can often be salvaged a pawn down but not against two queenside connected passed pawns} 31. Nd7 Rb7 32. Ne5 Nc3 {Now it's easy} 33. Nf3 b4 34. Ne1 b3 35. Nd3 b2 36. Nxb2 Rxb2 37. Rc1 Ne2+ {And White resigns a game which at a point was getting very much out of control. Just goes to show what can potentially happen if you pawn grab}
