1. c4 {Annotated by Isaac, as the white pieces.} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e3 Be7 5. d4 exd4 6. exd4 O-O 7. Bd3 Nb4 {I think this move loses tempo for black, because he moves his Knight out of a good position.} 8. Bb1 Re8 9. O-O d5 {Black attacks my centre. I now make the choice to go with an isolated queen pawn (Where no pawns are beside the D pawn on the E and C files) because I think it gives me excellent attacking options because of my Knight's access to e5 and bolstering it with moves like Qd3 and Rh3, attacking the King.} 10. a3 Na6 11. cxd5 Nxd5 {Here we are.} 12. Ne5 {Threatening Nxd5, Qxd5 Ba2! followed by capture on f7, forking the King and Rook.} Be6 13. f4 f6 {Trying to move my centralized Knight. } 14. Qh5 {If ... fxe5, Qxh7, Kf8, fxe5 check, Black must give back a piece, while white has a crushing attack.} f5 {If black were to play g6, then White has Bxg6! and Black has all sorts of problems. I was relying on my intuition to save me here and it worked out well, winning the f5 pawn with a decent attack.} 15. Bxf5 Bxf5 16. Qxf5 Bf6 17. Rf3 {Sending in another force (to h3)} Qd6 18. Nxd5 Qxd5 19. Rh3 Qxd4+ 20. Be3 {Developing another piece at the cost of a pawn.} Qd5 {Qxb2 must be looked at here. I think it would follow the same way as it would otherwise with Qxh7 check, King f8, followed by Rf1, preventing the capture at e5.} 21. Qxh7+ Kf8 22. Rf1 {Preventing the capture at e5. If Bxe5, then after fxe5 check, White wins the g7 pawn and the game.}
