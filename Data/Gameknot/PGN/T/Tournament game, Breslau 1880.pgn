[Opening "KGD (C31), Falkbeer, 3...e4"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 {Tarrasch adopts an aggressive line from the beginning, using the Falkbeer Counter Gambit to challenge von Scheve at once.} 3. exd5 e4 4. c4 c6 {All book so far.} 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. d3 Bb4 7. Qb3 {Von Scheve plays to drive the pinning B at once.} Bxc3+ {Tarrasch captures at once. No retreat today!} 8. bxc3 {A dubious decision. The recapture with the Q leaves the P position less of a disaster. } O-O {Before indulging in complications, Tarrasch secures his own King.} 9. dxe4 {Von Scheve wastes time here. Developing his K-side pieces and castling should be his priority.} Nxe4 {The natural recapture centralizes the Knight beautifully.} 10. Bd3 {Right idea, wrong K-side piece. 10 N-B3 was needed...} Qh4+ {...to prevent this powerful strike.} 11. g3 {Fleeing to the Q-side with 11 K-Q1 [to be followed with K-B2 and K-N1] may be better, as there the K would have many pieces around it for defense.} Nxg3 {Threatening 12... NxR dis ch. The trapped Rook cannot flee, so von Scheve tries...} 12. Nf3 {...this move, hoping to drive the Q.} Qh5 {Tarrasch retains the initiative by attacking the unguarded Knight.} 13. Rg1 {Loss of a piece was inevitable. Von Scheve elects to preserve his Rook.} Qxf3 {Tarrasch now sets a neat trap. Apparently White can regain the piece with 14 RxN, guarding the loose B at Q3 as well. However, 14 RxN??? in fact loses at once!} 14. Rxg3 {Von Scheve falls headlong into the trap. } Re8+ {The jaws of the trap snap abruptly shut. Von Scheve will now be checkmated unless he elects to give away ruinous amounts of material.} 15. Kd2 {This move is inevitable. Von Scheve can interpose with one or both of his Bishops, allowing ...RxB ch in reply, but eventually his King moves here.} Qf2+ {Von Scheve resigns rather than play 16 K-Q1 R-K8 mate.}
