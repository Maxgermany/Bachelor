Bxg5 Qa5 {Stupid- this should just go to c7, and avoid giving White a tempo.} 14. Nb3 Qc7 15. Bg2 b4 16. Ne2 d5 {Not achieved without a cost- the black Nf6 will spend some time returning to anywhere useful, I think.} 17. e5 Ng8 18. f4 a5 19. Nbd4 Ba6 20. b3 Bc5 21. Bf3 Ne7 22. h5 {Hadn't quite calculated this fully- 22.O-O-O fails to hg when the N is pinned. 22...Nf8 23.Bf6 Rg8 (Rh7, hg, Rxh1, gf ) 24.h6 Nh7 22...Rc8 23.hg Nxg6 24.Bh5 Ndxe5!? 25.fe Nxe5 maybe hangs on, but 24.Rxh8  Nx 25.Rh1 Ng6 26.f5 ef 27.Bxd5} Nf8 23. Bf6 Rg8 24. h6 {Hmm, this can't be right. After 24...Nh7, Black is suddenly looking pretty good. Black currently can't castle and once the Rh8 is exchanged off, this kingside looks a little exposed. It's difficult to see quite how White should procede, however, since the tempting Rdg1 starts to look a little uncomfortable after moves like Qb6 and Nf5. Maybe the simple 24.hg followed by swapping rooks and Rh1 will suffice. } Nh7 25. Bg7 a4 26. bxa4 Qa5 27. Nb3 Qxa4 28. Ned4 {28.Nxc4 is met by 28...Qa3  29.Kb1 and 29...Bxe2 when White will either get mated or lose a rook. Or both. } Qa3+ 29. Kb1 Bc4 30. Qe3 Nf5 31. Qf2 Nxd4 32. Rxd4 Qxa2+ 33. Kc1 Bxb3 34.
