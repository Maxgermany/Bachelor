[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {This was a training game between me and hfsdo. Any constructive criticism to myself or my opponent is welcomed. } c5 2. Bd3 {I like the originality of this opening, but as a beginner I would encourage following development rules until they become natural (i.e developing, center control, and king safety). This choice hinders development slightly as white now has to make more moves to fully develop his pieces.  } Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 {I am quite fond of playing g6 sicilians because I found that defending the king and developing are generally easier in these variations.  } 4. O-O {Quickly getting the king to safety is important, and white has done a nice job of that so far. } Bg7 5. Nc3 {This move misses the point of the opening. White's best intentions would have been to play c3 so that the bishop can back up to c2 and white would also get a chance to open up the center with the move d4. With this move, it is going to be difficult to mobilize the c and d pawns so that white can attack the center. } d6 {This move stops and pawn push to e5 ideas so that my knight can get to f6. } 6. b3 {A very smart way to develop the dark squared bishop. However, white must be tactically aware since the g7 bishop may cause problems. } Nf6 7. Bb2 O-O {White has played a fine opening so far. It may not be orthodox, but both sides still have several good ideas in the position.  } 8. Bb5 {? I actually like what white was trying to do here. Trading bishop for knight may have been quite useful for white in order to try and open up the center with and e5 push. However, this move drops a pawn because of the pin on the c3 knight. } Nxe4 {Before moving, it is important to try and identify the forcing responses (captures,checks) by the opponent that could end up winning losing material. Blunder checking every move will dramatically reduce these types of oversights. } 9. d3 {?? Losing a pawn was not the end of the world, but this is. Another unfortunate oversight that now drops a piece. } Nxc3 10. Bxc3 Bxc3 11. Rb1 {It is always smart to play on, even when down a piece. An opponent could very easily be caught off guard and make their own blunders. } Bg4 {Developing and temporarily pinning the knight and threatening the move Nd4/Ne5. } 12. Bxc6 {It is usually best not to exchange pieces when down in material, but in the instance it was necessary to prevent me from taking advantage of the pin on the knight.  } bxc6 13. a4 {It is tough to find a good move for white. Probably h3 was best just to try and get to kick the bishop and try to activate the queen and knights.  } Qd7 {Not the best move, but it was in some way a test to see if white could detect the threat of Qf5 which would cause doubled pawns around the white king. } 14. Qe2 {An understandable move which applies pressure on e7. But this still does not address the issue of Qf5, which would have been prevented with the move h3. } Qf5 {Now there is nothing that white can do to stop the king's position from being exposed.} 15. Qxe7 Bxf3 16. gxf3 Be5 {Rather on f3 right away, I decide to throw in this move which attempts to for checkmate by getting a queen and bishop battery on h2.  } 17. Qh4 {! A valiant defense that stops the queen from coming to f4. } Rab8 {?! I probably should have just taken the f3 pawn. This move was just a flashy attempt at bringing the rook to b4 to kick the queen. However, once again I underestimated the defensive ability of my foe.  } 18. Rbe1 {Another nice resource so that if I play Rb4 white can block with Re4, which is exactly what occurs. } Rb4 19. Re4 Qxf3 {Finally snatching the f3 pawn. } 20. Rxb4 cxb4 21. Re1 {There is still some opportunities for my opponent if I am not careful. For example, Re3 followed by Rh3 is still a decent try here. } Re8 {A nifty move which at first appears to be a blunder due to the fact that d4 appears to pin the bishop to the rook. But this is not the case because of the threat of Bxh2+, which would win the rook.} 22. d4 {The final blunder which allows a checkmate.} Bxh2+ {After Kxh2 Rxe1 there is no way to stop Rh1 mate. In light of this, my opponent resigned. Overall I saw a lot of potential in hfsdo with his creative ideas and resourcefulness. The biggest problem now is simple tactical oversights which can be avoided with more practice and a blunder check system. Think before each move, "is there a forcing move that my opponent can play in response to this". Thank you for reading, and any comments are greatly appreciated. }
