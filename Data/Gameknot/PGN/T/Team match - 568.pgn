[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), Chigorin variation"]

1. d4 {This is a short game I barely won because my opponent missed one move that could've saved him. I'm white.} d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 {Usual opening I use sometimes.} Bb4 4. Bd2 Bxc3 5. Bxc3 Nf6 6. e3 O-O {As you will see later, I quickly break into blacks king side, only it cost me.} 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Ng5 g6 {best move and most common to guard the h pawn.} 9. Be2 h6 10. Nh3 g5 11. f4 {I'm trying to force equal pawn trades to break in.} Ne4 12. Bf3 {This was the mistake which cost me later, but it was the whole reason I broke into his king side. Just one of those mistakes that works out because your opponent gets the idea that your handicapped without the piece.} Nxc3 {Sure likes even trades.} 13. bxc3 {Black must have been planning to threaten me with a fork later. Who knows how that would've worked out.} f5 {Here's where I make the mistake of not moving my bishop.} 14. g3 g4 {Now I'm forked.} 15. Nf2 {I thought it would be better to have the knight since I could move my queen into his king side when he captures.} gxf3 16. Qxf3 {Which I do.} Qe8 {Trying to keep me out.} 17. g4 {But I find a way in anyway.} Rf6 18. g5 hxg5 19. fxg5 Rg6 {This was blacks mistake where he let my queen get closer in for the kill. } 20. Qh5 {As you can see.} Ne7 {Trying to bring in reinforcement's.} 21. Nd3 {I'm hoping to get my knight to e5, my last hope, which you will see.} Kf8 {Why do this? It was actually the move that gave me the win, in a way. It would have been good if he didn't move his rook to g8 later, but he did.} 22. Ne5 Rg7 23. Qh8+ Rg8 {black should've moved his knightg there, but he's too late now.} 24. Qf6+ {Only one move left, it's over.} Qf7 25. Qxf7# {Not the longest game, but it's neat how such a bad opening leads to a win. I'd love to hear input, thx for reading.}
