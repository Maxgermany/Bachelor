1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {closed sicilian, very popular these days. don't know why... in my opinion it's a bit passive for white.} Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. d3 {why not d4? it seems white is afraid from the main lines here.} d5 {so, black breaks through!} 5. Be2 {it is beeter to take the pawn. where would the Knight go after d4?} d4 6. Nb1 e5 {black gained lots of space in an opening he should fight for this space.} 7. Na3 {the Knight plays for the third time now... what with the other pieces?} Be7 8. Nc4 Qc7 9. O-O b5 {in the next move the white will play his 5th move with the Knight. just half of the moves he made. a terrible waist of time.} 10. Ncd2 O-O 11. b3 {now c3 is a great hole.} a6 12. c4 {?? white forgot abot d:c3 e.p. now black is 1 pawn up and a great position.} dxc3 e.p. 13. Nb1 {its the third time the Knight stands on b1. } b4 14. a3 Be6 {keeping the pressure on white. b3, a3 and d3 are very weak.} 15. Bg5 Na5 16. axb4 cxb4 17. d4 Nxb3 {two great passing pawns. these are unstopable!} 18. d5 c2 19. Qd3 Bxd5 20. exd5 Nxa1 {game is now peactically lost.} 21. Rc1 e4 {black reviles his other attack - the King side!} 22. Qd4 exf3 {and now h2 is very weak. it is just a matter of time.} 23. Qxa1 Ng4 {wants h2.} 24. Bxe7 Qxh2+ 25. Kf1 Qh1# {nice.}
