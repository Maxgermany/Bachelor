1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It has been quite a while since I have annotated any games.  I have increased my games workload quite a bit and quite a few of those have been against Masters and Experts and some Class C Players who are giving me some tough games at the moment.  I did manage to win both my games over Lallit (who is ezyaz) - he played better with the black pieces than with the white.  Just like my other Class D buddy, The Dentist aka Tofuman, Lallit's optimum rating has once been in the 1400s so he can be a Dark Horse at times as my Class B Buddy NN found out.  Buddy NN now plays the Master Mater's favourite response to 1. e4 which is Nf6 which is the Alekhine's Defense.} Nf6 2. Qf3 {2. Qf3 - unusual but putting f7 under fire.  Is he gonna try the Scholar's Mate?  The Master Mater tried it against me in my second game against him with the Patzer's Opening to see if I was awake but I did defend against it!} Nc6 3. Bb5 Nd4 4. Qd3 Nxb5 5. Qxb5 Nxe4 {5. ...... Nxe4 - first blood to Buddy NN.  However does he lose from here?  Well, read on.} 6. Qe2 Nc5 7. Nf3 {7. Nf3 - normal development.} e6 8. O-O b6 9. d4 {9. d4 - after black prepares to fianchetto his lsb on b7, Lallit decided to strike out in the centre and poke the c5 knight.} Na6 10. a3 Be7 11. Ne5 {11. Ne5 - trying to summon up an attack but is this premature.  This knight can be driven back by either the d or f pawns.} Bf6 12. Nc3 {12. Nc3 - white continues to develop his pieces.} Bb7 13. b4 c6 14. Ne4 {14. Ne4 - puts the question to the black bishop and black decides to exchange it for that knight on e5.} Bxe5 15. dxe5 O-O 16. Nd6 {16. Nd6 - white tries to get compo for the pawn minus by lodging a knight deep into his opponent's position.  It will take a few moves from black to force it to move or to exchange it off.} Qc7 17. Qg4 Kh8 18. Re1 f5 19. Qg5 {19. Qg5 - if exf6 e.p?? then the knight on d6 drops to the BQ so the WQ must move.} c5 20. Re3 Be4 21. Rg3 {21. Rg3 - Suddenly a dark, dark shadow hovers over the black camp.  The BK suddenly feels very cold.  So he should, if he does not look out then he will get a visit from the Chessic Grim Reaper, Old Matey, who is eyeing up the g7 square.  Black beats him off with g6.} g6 22. h3 Qd8 23. Qe3 {23. Qe3 - declines a queen trade.} f4 {23. ..... f4, pawn fork - owwwch!} 24. Qxe4 fxg3 25. fxg3 {25. fxg3 - white is now the exchange to the bad but he does not give up!} Qe7 26. b5 Nc7 27. c4 a6 28. h4 Rf5 {28. ...... Rf5 - but amazingly black hands the exchange back.  That white knight is admittedly quite well camouflaged on d6.} 29. Nxf5 exf5 30. Qe3 axb5 31. Bb2 {31. Bb2 - white completes his development with a threat, a nasty discovered check on the BK on the long diagonal.} Qe6 32. cxb5 Nxb5 33. Qf3 {33. Qf3 - white is back to being a pawn minus but is still making threats, this one on the rook on a1.} Rc8 34. Rc1 Ra8 {34. ...... Ra8?? - the losing move, black forgets that his rook walked away from an attack from the WQ just a couple of moves ago, alas for him, that queen and the threat is still there and now the BQ feels the white heat!} 35. Qxa8+ Kg7 36. Re1 d6 37. Qc6 {37. Qc6? - what about cxd6+ winning the BQ?} Nd4 38. Bxd4 cxd4 {38. ..... cxd4 - black has a passed pawn but white is a R for P up, black has no sufficient compo for the rook although while the queens are still on the board there is still the possibility of a snap mate on black's part or Ye Olde Perpetualle.} 39. Kf2 Qa2+ 40. Re2 d3 {40. ..... d3?? - loses queen, why not simply Qxa3?} 41. Rxa2 dxe5 42. Rd2 {42. Rd2 - white is taking no chances, he blockades black's passer on d3.} e4 43. Qxb6 Kh6 {43. ..... Kh6 - black tries to shelter his king but it is only a matter of time before Old Matey closes in!} 44. a4 {44. a4 - after a second queen no doubt.} Kh5 45. Qf6 Kh6 46. a5 e3+ 47. Kxe3 f4+ 48. Kxf4 {48. Kxf4 - Old Matey starts to descend right now!} Kh5 49. Qg5# {49. Qg5 MATE!! - and now black cops it!  A sad end for my Class B opponent but many Kudos for Lalit for taking full advantage of his mistakes.}
