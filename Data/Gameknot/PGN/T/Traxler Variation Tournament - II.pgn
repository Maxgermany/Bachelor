[Opening "two knights defence (C57), Wilkes Barre (Traxler) variation"]

1. e4 {Beginning with Black's wildly speculative gambit line, the game remained hard-fought and even for much of its length.  Even when, with a couple of sacrifices, Black developed pressure on the Q-side, the issue remained in the balance until a sudden collapse brought about an abrupt finish.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 {(!?) The signature move of the Traxler (or Wilkes-Barre) Variation of the Two Knights Defence.  In effect, Black is defying White to do his worst at f7, figuring on making good use of the cost White incurs in time.} 5. Bxf7+ {The most popular response in this Tournament.  The GK engine book ends here with this move, and assesses the position as +1.37 in favour of White.  How accurate is this assessment?  The alternatives, 5.Nxf7 and 5.d4 are considered more compromising for White, especially the N capture which provokes a vicious counter-attack by 5...Bxf2+!  (NOTE: where I give GK evaluations, + will indicate a White edge; - (minus) a Black advantage).} Ke7 {Occasionally, 5...Kf8 was tried.  I can't say I liked the move enough to give it a crack, myself... It keeps the Queen's diagonal open, but at the cost of shutting in the rook.} 6. Bb3 {The most circumspect retreat.  Also playable was 6.Bd5.  For some reason, no one plays 6.Bc4.  There doesn't seem to be any special reason why not, unless White anticipates he would probably have to move the thing again.  Incidentally, the GK engine assessed this position at +0.52 - a come-down from two moves ago.  Why?  Was there a better alternative?  Or is the position so full of possibilities that a consistent assessment is hard to arrive at?} Rf8 {To bring pressure against f2.} 7. d3 {A good alternative was 7.0-0.  A matter of personal preference; objectively there is little to choose between the two moves.} d6 {Also playable are 7...h6 and 7...Qe8.  I have played the former with success OTB, but maybe the Queen move is to be preferred, bringing it quickly into the action.} 8. Nf3 {(!?) Interesting decision, to bring the knight back before it was attacked.  But maybe White was anticipating that I would play 8...h6 now, transposing into the line 7...h6 8Nf3 d6.  It was worth considering!} Bg4 {Threatening ...Nd4 and wrecking White's K-side.  } 9. Be3 {I had expected 9.c3 here, to keep the Black N out of d4.  Instead, White intends to exchange it off.} Nd4 {Playable was 9...Bxe3, I guess, but that seemed to me to strengthen White's centre.  The doubled pawns wouldn't have devalued White's material edge very much.} 10. Bxd4 Bxd4 {The pressure against f2 is easily enough contained, but the open a7-g1 diagonal is useful for Black.} 11. c3 Bb6 {At this point the GK engine gives the game +0.46 in White's favour - less than half a pawn.} 12. Nbd2 Qe8 {(!?) A mistake, according to the GK engine, anticipating Black's attack by 12...Qe8?  13.h3 Bh5  (Better might be 13...Bd7) 14.0-0 Kd8!? 15.Nc4 Bc5  16.d4, and White is building up an imposing centre as counter to Black's K-side pressure.  Would I have followed this line?  As it happened, White deviated at once from this recommneded line.  Meanwhile, GK preferred 12...Nh5 13.Qe2!? Nf4  14.Qf1 Rf6  15.Bc4 Bxf3  16.Nxf3 Nh3!  17.d4 exd4  18.cxd4 Ba5+  19.Kf1 Kf8 with close to an even game.  I don't recall that at this point of the game I was giving ...Nh5 much thought at all.} 13. Qc2 {(!?) Incontrast to the +0.94 assessment awarded the 13.h3 line, GK assesses this position at +0.30, but without further comment.  White is being cagey, here: keeping open which side upon which to castle, and preparing - it seemed to me - a counter-action in the centre.} Qh5 {(!?) Consistent, but GK misliked this move as well, again in favour of ...Nh5.  The line it suggests goes 13...Nh5 14.h3 Bxf3  15.Nxf3 Nf4  16.Rh2 Qg6 (16...Qh5!?) 17.Kf1 Qh5 with K-side pressure.  If then 18.d4 Nxg2  19.Rxg2 Qxf3  20.Rxg7+ Kd8.  At this point, GK gives 21.Rxh7, but then Black would gain a big advantage by 21...Qh1+.  Better seems 21.Be6.} 14. h3 {(!?) Instead of this, GK had suggested 14.d4, with the continuation 14...Bxf3  15.Nxf3 exd4  16.Nxd4 Ng4  17.f3 Ne3  18.Qf2 Qg5  19.Rg1 Ng4  20.h4! Nxf2  21.hxg5 Bxd4  22.cxd4 and the assessment +0.91.  On the whole, that assessment seems reasonable, going into an ending a pawn ahead, for which Black has almost no compensation.  But as GK assessed White position after the text move (14.h3) at only a little less (+0.88), it seems hardly objectionable.} a5 {A 'frightener': daring White to castle long.  Whatever its objective value, I did have a long-term idea in mind to attack as quickly as possible on the Q-side if the White King should fetch up there.  For the moment, the White h-pawn is pinned.} 15. Rf1 {Unpinning, but declining to castle 'into it' by 15.0-0.  The fact is, Black's resources are still mainly trained upon the K-side, and the castled King would have received a thorough mauling: 15.0-0?? Bxh3!  16.gxh3 Qxh3 17.d4 Ng4, and with the rook about to enter the fray via f6, White would be hard put to survive.} Bd7 {But now, no longer able to maintain itself at g4, the bishop retreats betimes.  I didn't want to exchange it at f3, though that idea did come into consideration.} 16. a4 {Stopping the Black a-pawn, and ensuring the safety of the b3-bishop.} c6 {(!?) Beginning seriously to think in terms of Q-side attack.  But GK assessed this as inaccurate, preferring 16...Qg6.  I did consider this move - almost played it in fact.  But it didn't seem to offer much.  The line given by GK seems typical: 16...Qg6  17.g4 Ne8  18.Nh4 Qh6  19.Nf5+ Bxf5 (already I'm none too enchanted with this line) 20.gxf5 Kd8  21.Nc4 Bc5  22.Rg1  Qxh3  23.0-0-0 Qf3.  Although GK assesses this as +0.06 - practically even - I can't say I go a bundle over it for Black, especially as 21.Be6 seems a vast improvement in this line.} 17. O-O-O {An alternative plan here was 17.Bc4; 18.Qb3.} Rfb8 {'Here I come, ready or not!'  Admittedly, this telegraphed Black's punch, rather.  But I was worried that if I delayed this move the King might fetch up on the back rank and interrupt the communication between this rook and the Q-side.  } 18. Nc4 {(!?)  During the game, I thought this was a very good move, preparing the way for the central thrust that I thought White was aiming for.  But it seems White might have had better options in 18.g4 or 18.Bc4.} Bc7 {Hereabouts, GK couldn't seem to settle upon an assessment, with over +1.00 after Black moves and under +1.00 after white moves.  Well, maybe the play of both sides is improveable hereabouts.  I was trying to play actively, and 'forcing it' a bit.  Possibly a more cagey approach was called for, objectively speaking.} 19. Ne3 Qg6 {It was about now that the idea of ...Nf6-h5-f4 occurred to me.  A bit late in the day, but the pressure against g2 and d3 seemed attractive.} 20. Rfg1 b5 {Back to the Q-side plan.  It has to be admitted, White doesn't look too badly placed in defence!} 21. Qd2 {Offering a centralising escape square for the bishop, or preparing to thrust down the d-file?  I would have been happy enough had White played 21.axb5.} bxa4 22. Bxa4 {(?) The first small slip by White - not that it is so serious.  GK recommends first 22.Nh4! Qh5  23.Nf5+ Bxf5  24.Nxf5+ Kf8 and now: 25.Bxa4  Qf7 (seizing the vacated a2-g8 diagonal)  26.Qg5 h6  27.Qg3 Nh5  28.Qf3 Ra6  29.b3 Nf4 30.Kd2 with a slight advantage to White.  } Qf7 {Decoying the bishop has opened up the b-file and the a2-g8 diagonal for the Black heavy pieces.  Can White weather the storm - or conjure up counterplay of his own?  } 23. c4 {Blocking off the Black Queen's diagonal.  Although I thought the move pretty effective, GK preferred 23.b3 as more accurate.  After 23. c4 Rb4 24.Qc2 Rab8 25.b3 c5  26.Bxd7 Kxd7 Black seems to have a little bit of an attack.  But I had something rather more emphatic in mind, as will soon appear.} Rb4 24. b3 {A plausible departure from GK's 24.Qc2.} Rab8 {(!?) An inaccuracy, according to GK, which preferred to offer the exchange of bishops by 24...c5.  I don't think so!} 25. Nc2 {Driving off the rook?} Rxa4 {(!?) Nope.  I wanted to attack vigorously in this game, and finish the MT on a high.  Sure, this was speculative, but I felt that Black's resources were enough to see me through for a draw.  The response of the GK engine was interesting. Before this move, GK thought the position +0.20; after it, +0.33.  Such a small change in assessment is trivial.  Though speculative, the sac was at least playable.} 26. bxa4 c5 {For the exchange, Black got a handy open b-file and some very fascinating diagonals to work with, plus, with the fall of White's a-pawn, Black's passed pawn might have a say in the outcome.} 27. Qc3 Bxa4 28. Qa3 {In most hard fought games you get to a point that feels like the crux of the game.  It is at this point that Fischer used to go into what he called a 'big think'.  So it was here.  How to feed the flames of attack?  The answer was soon reached: shove more wood on the fire.  Much of the 'big think' was confirming this second sac was playable...} Nxe4 {(!) } 29. dxe4 {(!) If instead 29.Qxa4 Rb1+!  30.Kxb1 Nc3+ and 31...Nxa4, after which I would really have fancied Black's winning chances!} Qxc4 {Completely blasts away White's remaining Q-side pawn, and threatening mate into the bargain.  But the attack is still speculative (check out White's material edge at +3).  At this point the GK engine evaluated the position at +0.59 - slight edge to White.  However, I felt the attack should be good for a draw ... at least.  After all, according to GK I have 2.41 pawns' worth of spatial and temporal advantages... :)} 30. Rd2 {(!?) The alternative was 30.Ne1 to which I would probably have responded 30...Rb3.} Bb3 {(!) I am very pleased with this move, so hard was it to find.  The reason is that the rook so wants to land on this square - you wouldn't believe how close I came to playing it.  The problem, though, is that after 30...Rb3 31.Qa2 it was devilishly hard to find any kind of worthwhile follow-up.  The relatively quiet bishop move frees the a-pawn to advance, which in turn gives a square to the under-employed bishop on c7.} 31. Kd1 {This does not unpin the knight, but what other defence was available?} a4 32. Qc1 {(?) Unexpected, and the first indications that White was beginning to buckle under the pressure.  Instead, 32.Qb2 seemed to keep White in the fight:  32.Qb2 Qxe4 (actually I might well have played 32...Ra8 here, but this is the line GK gives) 33.Re1 Bxc2+ 34.Rxc2 Qd5+  35.Rd2 Rxb2!? (extraordinary line) 36.Rxd5 a3  37.Kc1 Rxf2  38.Re3 Rf1+  39.Kc2 Ke6 (-0.48 - i.e. a slight edge for Black).  But  after...} Ba5 {... Brings up the last reserves for a very strong attack.} 33. Re2 {(?) Obviously, to remove the rook from the direct attack.  But now White can not survive Black's onslaught.  Some prospect of holding out might have been gained by 33.Nfe1 Bxd2  34.Kxd2 Qxe4, but even then White's chances were slender.  Now White's chances are nil.} Qd3+ 34. Nd2 {Now both knights are pinned.  But no better was 34.Rd2 Bxc2+  35.Qxc2 Rb1+  36.Qxb1 Qxb1+ etc.} a3 {(!) I had originally intended 34...Bxd2 - even wrote it down to be played.  But at the last minute I found that this quiet advance was immediately decisive.} 35. Re3 {Desperation, I suspect.  Now Black has a forced mate.} Bxc2+ 36. Qxc2 {The game would have been prolonged by one move with 36.Ke1.  But I appreciated White's sporting gesture with this move.} Rb1+ {(0-1) Whatever White plays, Black's Q mates at d2.  It is not seldom that a tough, hard-fought struggle ends suddenly with a dramatic collapse.  From my point of view, a very enjoyable game.}
