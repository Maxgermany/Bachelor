[Opening "Sicilian (B22), Alapin's variation (2.c3)"]

1. e4 {I was White in this team match where I played a risky overextensive attack.} c5 {The Sicilian Defense is the most common response to e4, and leads to imbalanced interesting positions.} 2. c3 {This is passive compared to the normal Nf3. Although it is safer than Open Sicilian and White often gets a microscopic advantage if played accurately. Right now I'm trying to master the Open Sicilian lines. The Alapin variation (2.c3) is somewhat drawish.} d6 {Most common moves for Black are 2...Nf6 and 2...d5. I recommend Nf6.} 3. d4 {The point of c3.} cxd4 {Black usually doesn't take the pawn immediately. This opening is very passive for Black, but it is safer than the common variations, and Black can play this to avoid studying, although in the variations where Black gives up the centre instead of fighting for it with Nf6 or d5, White is usually better.} 4. cxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {Black usually develops his dark bishop to e7 in this opening. Aiming for a dragon-type setup here isn't as good as it is in Open Sicilian, because here I have a pawn on d4 which would block the fianchetto.} 6. Bg5 {Other developing moves aren't as active.} Bg7 7. f4 {This is slightly overextensive. I considered Qd2 then Bh6, but it doesn't really do much to help me. I couldn't think of a good plan here, so I'm just starting a kingside pawnstorm.} O-O {Castles into my attack.} 8. Be2 {Preparing g4.} a6 {Preparing to gain space on queenside.} 9. g4 {My kingside is totally overextended, but I'm adding pressure against Black's king.} b5 10. Bxf6 {Black's knight is worth more than my bishop, since the knight defends the kingside and puts pressure on e4, while my bishop isn't necessary for my attack.} exf6 {Black decides to weaken his d-pawn and enclose his bishop. He was probably afraid of g5 tempo gain by recapturing with bishop. But exf6 is weakening.} 11. f5 {Now Black's f-pawns can't advance, so his bishop will never become powerful on its long diagonal.} Bb7 {As for the light bishop, it is strong on the other long diagonal, since it aims at my weakened kingside.} 12. Bf3 {Counters Black's pressure on the long diagonal.} Nd7 {Re8 is slightly more accurate since it threatens to win the e-pawn with b4, but it didn't really matter since Black played the threat next move.} 13. h4 {My kingside is now fully overextended, so I need to be careful not to let Black's pieces into my weakened squares on the kingside. This is an example of a superdynamic imbalanced position. Will I succeed in my overextensive attack on the kingside? or will Black take advantage of my uncastled king and loose centre pawns?} Re8 {Threatens b4 then Bxe4.} 14. Qb3 {Stops b4.} Qb6 {Black is beginning his counterplay against my weak central pawns.} 15. Nge2 Rac8 16. Rd1 {I need to defend my d-pawn again, because I plan to move my e2 knight to join the attack on Black's kingside.} Bc6 {Black adds another defender to b5, to prepare a5 with a seemingly pointless queenside attack.} 17. Nf4 {I'm threatening to win a pawn, because f7 is pinned.} g5 18. Nh5 {Taking the pawn opens the h-file toward Black's king, but also allows Black to unleash his bishop toward my overextended position.} a5 {Black can't do much in this position. Notice how my centre is well defended now, keeping Black's pieces away from active squares.} 19. hxg5 {Now I can let Black unleash his bishop, since I will chop it off next move.} fxg5 {The game was over in a few moves, but Black could've tried stopping my attack with a4. I think I'd still be winning because I have ideas of Qc2 and Qh2, or I could complicate the game with Qb4, hitting d6.} 20. Nxg7 {Watch how I finish off Black.} Kxg7 {I think Black could've still hung in there with a4, but it's too late now.} 21. Rxh7+ {Hilarious! A lot of dynamic attacks require a sacrifice to finish off the king.} Kxh7 {Black has to accept my rook sacrifice, unless he wants to get mated faster, which doesn't really matter to me.} 22. Qxf7+ {I have completed my kingside attack, and Black's position is dead lost.} Kh8 {No matter where Black moves, his king is stalemated, so all I need is one more check to mate him.} 23. Rd2 {Black resigned! All I needed was one more simple check to win, and there is no stopping Rh2.}
