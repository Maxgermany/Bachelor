1. e4 g6 {The Modern Defense. I like it because you have your bishop in the flank, bearing down on a big diagonal.} 2. b3 {Interesting, Trying to keep some control on the a1-h8 diagonal.} Bg7 3. d4 c5 {I like this move, It shows the first tactic, Attack the pinned piece!} 4. Bb2 Nc6 5. Nf3 cxd4 6. Bxd4 {I would have taken with the knight, GK Computer calls it an inaccuracy.} Nxd4 7. Nxd4 Nf6 8. e5 {Tries to save the pawn but loses to a fork that I will show you next.} Qa5+ 9. Qd2 Qxe5+ 10. Be2 {Be2? I don't like it.} Ne4 11. Qd3 {Wins a pawn} Nxf2 12. Rf1 {Rf1??? I'm not sure why he played this. All I was after with 11..... Nxf2 was that pawn but he gave me his queen.} Nxd3+ {And that's all she wrote as antonio37 resigns. Feel free to  make any comments! }
