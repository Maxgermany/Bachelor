[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 {3... h6 and 5... a6 always seem so slow at this stage. Unless a) I plan on advancing my bishop, and b) that advancing the bishop would be a good move, there is no need to defend against it :S} 4. O-O Bc5 5. c3 a6 6. d4 {Giving me good central initiative.} exd4 7. cxd4 Bb6 8. Re1 Nge7 9. b3 {Perhaps too slow -- am preparing the fianchetto as I expect black to castle kingside and I wish to be able to open lines of attack.} O-O 10. Bb2 d6 11. h3 {Preventing the Bg4 pin, which seems especially awkward with the current pressure on the d4 pawn.} Ng6 12. Bd3 {This move was strange. It was designed to play e5 and make a full attack, but in hindsight it seems just a waste. Nb-d2 for development or Qd2 to prevent Nf4 would both be superior.} Nf4 {Horrible squeeze now :(} 13. Kh2 {Preventing 13... Nxh3 14. gxh3 Bxh3 with a horribly exposed king.} Nb4 14. Bc4 {Trying not to let the bishop trade for his knight.} Bd7 15. a3 Nc6 {These last two moves are clearly beneficial to white. Black has had to return his knight, and the previously moved out bishop is now blocked. White has gained a bit of space on the Queenside.} 16. Qd2 Ng6 {Now White has more freedom to develop. I would like to generate a firm attacking strategy, but at the same time I need to connect my rooks and develop my B knight. Nc3 seems week as it blocks the bishop and has a hard time getting to a more useful position. I would rather Nd2 allowing Nf1 and Ng3 if needs be, but the queen is in the way.  I have gone with Qc3 as it allows the powerful d5 advance (threating mate and attacking the c6 knight) and allows Nb-d2.} 17. Qc3 Qf6 18. Nbd2 {Developing as planned.} Kh8 {Presumably freeing the f7 pawn, so I'm guessing a kingside attack is being hoped for.} 19. Re2 {This is poor. I didn't want to play e3 and put the rook into a pin. But black can just play Nf4 now.} Rae8 20. Rae1 Nf4 {Ah, tricksy, I'm very cramped here, albeit well developed.} 21. Re2e3 Qg6 {Threatening Qxg2#} 22. Nh4 {Threatening the queen and defending against the mate.} Qf6 {Lots of options here. Nh-f3 is obvious, looking at a perpetual draw, but it seems early for that. Nd-f3 is interesting, but it heavily commits the h4 knight - If the bishop at b6 wasn't attacking the e3 rook it would be playable and interesting, but I don't want to risk the combination after 23. Nf3 g5 24. d5 Qxc3 25. Bxc3  Which seems to leave the h4 knight and the e3 rook hanging.  23. Rf3 is very interesting if it wasn't for the fact the Nx4 seems to kill any hopes on that line. 23. Rg3 increases the threat of d5 but again the d4 pawn is hanging.  I think I have no choice but to play Nh-f3, and take a draw if black does not play for more.} 23. Nhf3 Qg6 24. Nh4 Qf6 25. Nhf3 {Draw agreed, only two pawns off the table at this point, but I think this is probably the right result as it looks like any other lines could hurt the player deviating from the repetition.}
