1. d4 b6 {English Defense.} 2. Nf3 Bb7 3. e3 d5 4. g3 {Not in the database.  Pc4 and Be2 are only slightly more common.} Nc6 5. Bg2 e6 6. O-O Qf6 7. a3 O-O-O 8. b4 Nh6 9. Nbd2 Ng4 10. c4 dxc4 11. Nxc4 Qh6 12. Nh4 {I doubt black was going to trade a knight for the h2 pawn.  Pe4 looks interesting.  Oh, wait--white is thinking QxNg4.} Be7 13. Qxg4 {Right.} f5 14. Qf4 Qxf4 15. exf4 Bxh4 16. gxh4 Nxd4 17. Bxb7+ Kxb7 18. Bb2 Ne2+ {Nf3+ might have been better.  19. Kg2 NxPh4+.  On the other hand, this one yields NxPf4 in a single move.  There is no protecting against BxPg7, but black WANTS white to do that so long as the king is on the g file.} 19. Kh1 Nxf4 20. Ne5 {White seeks to fork the black rooks.} Rd5 21. Rac1 Nd3 22. Nxd3 Rxd3 23. Bxg7 Rg8 24. Be5 c6 25. Rc3 Rd5 26. Bg3 e5 27. f3 f4 28. Bf2 h5 29. Rfc1 Rd6 {I think I prefer going on the offense here--Rd2.  The white king cannot protect that bishop.  White moves either Be1 or Rf1.} 30. a4 a6 31. Re1 Re6 {I still prefer Rd2.} 32. Rc2 Rgg6 33. Rce2 Red6 34. Re2xe5 Rd2 {Too late for Rd2 now--white can force mate.  Kc7 might have stopped that.} 35. Re5e7+ Kc8 36. Bxb6 Rgg2 37. Rc7+ Kd8 38. Rg7+ Kc8 39. Re8+ {}
