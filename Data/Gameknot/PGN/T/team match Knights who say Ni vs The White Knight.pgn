[Opening "Scandinavian (B01), Icelandic gambit"]

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {The most agressive line in the Scandinavian. It may be that this line should be considered ´incorrect´, but at my level, I am unlikely to encounter opponents that can actually prove this and there are seceral lines that can lead to very agressive and tactically interesting games.} 3. c4 e6 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {Icelandic variation. At this point, it is unlikely that black will regain his pawn soon, but the head start in development often leads to quick control over the central files, so that white will have to deal with a lot of pressure.} 5. d4 Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Qe7 {Maybe not the best. The idea of course is to set up the discovered check by taking the c-pawn, but white now gets the chance to build up a solid defense by blocking the e-file with Be3, leaving little play for black in exchange for the sacrifice pawn. A more agressive option would have been 6.... Ne4} 7. Be2 {Not the best defense. While it blocks the discovered check, black can still take on c4, because the bishop that was defending it is now pinned. A balancing factor to all this is that taking on c4 merely equalizes material and that white will regain his slight advantage in the development because black needs to make so many moves with his bishop. However, the c-pawn is also rather important, because once it is gone, the d-pawn can no longer count on support from fellow pawns and will therefore likely become a prey for black in the future.} Bxc4 8. Be3 Bxe2 9. Ngxe2 {The exchange allowed white to develop quickly. A better idea may have been Bd5, as the most likely line that would follow is development of the knight towards f3 (either directly or through exchange of the bishop on f3), which would leave the knight on c3 weaker and more susceptible to moves like Ne4} Ng4 {In hindsight this is a rather weird move. Of course, I pressure e3, but Qd3 is an excellent defense, and that's most likely where white would want to place it anyway. Simply furthering development, through Nc6 and then castling on either side would have been more solid.} 10. Qd3 Nc6 11. O-O O-O-O {immediately posts the rook where it needs to be and the asymmetric castling makes it all the more likely that the game will become dynamic and interesting.} 12. a3 Bd6 13. g3 h5 {trying to put pressure on the freshly created weakness in the king's position.} 14. h4 {But it is quickly blocked by white} f6 {Preparing g5} 15. Bf4 Bxf4 16. Nxf4 Rxd4 {I could not resist the promiss of winning a pawn, but perhaps it would have been better to continue the project of opening the h-file via 15...g5} 17. Qf5+ Qd7 18. Qxd7+ Rxd7 19. Rad1 Rhd8 {Thoughtless. There wasn't really a good reason to give up a pawn at this point. g5 to poke away the knight before the moving the rook on h8 would probably have been better. If black would trade rooks at d7, he would momentarily gain control over the d-file, which benefits him to some extent, but this close to the endgame, the extra pawn is probavly worth fighting for.} 20. Rxd7 Rxd7 21. Nxh5 Rd2 {Once again, an attempt to save the pawn through 21... g6 22. Nf4 Nce5 could well be better, although in this case, white could follow that up with forcing the rook trade, leaving  a rather equal knight end game regardless.} 22. Nxg7 Rxb2 23. f3 Nge5 {f3 is actually rather weakening, since I threaten to set up an attack and 24. f4 leads to Ng4, blocking the march of the white passed pawns.} 24. Ne4 Nd4 25. Rf2 {25, Nxf6 was not allowed, because of 25...Nxf3 26. Rxf3 (Kh1 Rh2#) Nxf3 } Nexf3+ 26. Kg2 Rb3 {In hindsight I don't really like this move. I considered I might be able to block the white's pawns with my knights, so I wanted to create three connected passed pawns to force the issue. However, as we will see later, white's rook becomes an important tool to cut off my king from the king side. Therefore, 26...Rxf2 27.Kxf2 f5 followed with rushing my king to the king side to catch white's passed pawn was likely better.} 27. Nd2 {Excellent move by white that I had overlooked. the trade is forced and immediately places the white rook firmly on the d-file, cutting my king off from any potential interference with his h-pawn.} Nxd2 28. Rxd2 Nc6 {On its way to e5 from where it will have access to both g6 and f7 for control over h8} 29. h5 Ne5 30. h6 Nf7 {Chosen over g6 as it would be more easily protected by the king here (e.g. 31. Rf2 Kd7 32. Rxf6 Ke7), but g6 would have been a foil to white's following move (to some extent at least)} 31. Nf5 b6 {It is a necessity to create some breating space for the king, since white threatens to push the king with Ne7. While white cannot checkmate at d8 because of the knight on f7, black would still rather not be forced to place his king on b8, as it would allow for overloading the defensive responsibilities of the knight, threatening both Rd8 and h8Q} 32. h7 Rxa3 33. Ne7+ Kb7 34. Rd8 {As previously stated, the knight has too many defensive responsibilities at this point, so it can't afford to take the rook. White's approach here is quite interesting. Of course he is piling on the pressure right now, but he also moves his rook away from the second row, where it was crucially protecting his king. As we will see, this seals the fate of the game. Another option white had was to keep his rook as a defense to his king and play Ng6. This would allow him to trade his h-pawn for the black knight. At that point the game would become a race between the three connected passed pawns for black and the single passed pawn (black's f-pawn is likely not going to hold out much longer after the knight is taken) that is supported by an additional piece. I have not looked into this end game very thoroughly, so I can't really say if Rd8 would be a mistake, as it throws away a won endgame, or rather a great way to force the draw, but it is certainly interesting to play out the more daring option of 34. Ng6 a few times as an end game training.} Ra2+ 35. Kg1 Ra1+ 36. Kg2 {A draw is agreed as repetition of moves is now unavoidable. The white king needs to make sure he prevents the black rook from taking control over the h-file, since that would cost him his most important pawn. At the same time, black needs to keep 'trying' to do just that, as he would otherwise allow white to play Rf8, winning the knight. Overall the game seemed like a bit of a back and forth between two parties that both obtained small advantages during it, but could never properly capitalize on these advantages and ultimately both ended up conceding them to the other player. At least studying the game revealed some subtleties that might be learned from in order to be able to turn small advantages into a win next time.}
