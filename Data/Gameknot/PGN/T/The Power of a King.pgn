1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kan defense. } 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 {This move for black creates doubled pawns on the kingside, but they are not as harmful, and black gets descent, open play. } 5. Nxf6+ exf6 {Another variation is gxf6, with further aggressive plans of attack.  } 6. Bc4 Be6 {Trying to get rid of doubled pawns as soon as possible. } 7. Qe2 Qe7 8. Bb3 {The bishop retreats. It is now not advisory to capture it, since that will give white and open a-file, which can be used for quick mobilization of the rook, and turned into an advantage. } Nd7 9. O-O O-O-O 10. d3 Bxb3 {I finally decide to capture, since my king is ready to protect a7 in time of need. } 11. Qxe7 Bxe7 12. axb3 a6 {Permanently defending the pawn, but...} 13.

Ba5 Bc7 17. Bxc7 Kxc7 18. Rae1 {The position is now roughly equal, but in white's favor. I now try to activate my knight. Notice that doubled pawns actually do come in handy - the pawn on f6 prevents the white knight from making uncomfortable threats at e5 and g5.} Nf8 19. Re3 {Trying to double rooks, but I close the file. } Rxe3 20. fxe3 Ne6 {Finally! Black's knight moves into the game.} 21. Nh4 {White's move, threatening to move to f5. Now, the position settles, and a choice - what should black do? Black's position extends only up to the 6th rank, and no further. In the meantime, white's activity in the center may cause serious problems. Black's position is fairly rigid, but , what next...?  So, I decide to launch an attack on the queenside, and by attack, I mean barge in with the king onto the ranks of white's weak pawns... } Kb6 {To victory!} 22. b4 {White stops the king, but I attempt to still break through with my flank pawn. } a5 23. bxa5+ Kxa5 24.

Nf3 {Trying to trade, but black's knight has other destinations...} Ne4 {Into the center! White's rook now cannot defend all of its objectives, and black gains at least one pawn. } 27. Rc2 Kb3 {Forward!} 28. Re2 Kxc4 {Ah.... the fruits of the king's labor, which involved heading across the board from c7 to b3, without any cover from other pieces whatsoever. But work is not done yet...} 29. Kf1 Ra8 {Black's rook springs from a useless position onto an open file. } 30. Nd2+ {Trying to trade a second time, but...} Kd3 {... the king is restless. White is forced to capture.} 31. Nxe4 Kxe4 32. Kf2 Ra2 {Finally, black's king asserted an outpost in the center of the board, his rook is active, while the pieces of white are completely locked down. Try to compare this position with that of move 18!} 33. Rd2 b5 {Black tries to deadlock the position even further with b5-b4-b3, but white does not let that happen .} 34. Ke2 b4 35. b3 {Now, the rooks have to be traded, leaving black still dominant. } Rxd2+ 36. Kxd2 {Alright, a second position. What should black do now? Although a pawn up, white's position is hard to break. I decide to let the untouched kingside pawns to come into play, an launch a pawn attack on the kingside, using the centralized position of my king. } f5 37. g3 g5 38. Ke2 h5 39. h3 f6 {All the pawns are in position, and black waits for the perfect, zugzwang moment, which arises right now...} 40. h4 f4 {And the breakthrough. Now, white gets overrun, and soon resigns. } 41. gxf4 gxh4 {And white resigned 0-1. An excellent game by both players, showing the power of the king and maneuvering in delicate middlegames.  }
