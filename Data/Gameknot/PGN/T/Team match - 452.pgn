[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Lundin (Kevitz-Mikenas) defence"]

1. d4 Nc6 {I can't believe I went through another never-before-encountered opening, the Queen pawn Lundin defence.} 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bc4 e6 4. d5 {white is weak, but is trying to demolish my pawn/knight structure} Nb4 5. c3 Nbxd5 6. Nf3 Bc5 7. b4 Nxb4 8. Ba3 a5 {Two attempts, but white has not taken my knight.} 9. O-O Nfd5 10. Bb5 c6 {somehow, the bishop/pawn structure failed to prevail. Retreat is almost impossible.} 11. cxb4 axb4 12. Nd4 bxa3 13. Qc2 Qb6 14. Nd2 d6 15. Rab1 Bd7 16. Ne4 cxb5 17. Qd1 O-O {by not retreating, white has a lost game. Can you see how I can pulverize white.} 18. f4 Nxe3 {this move gives up my knight, for a pulverized game.} 19. Qe2 Nxf1 20. Qxf1 {this LATE retreat invites black to follow up a series of unstoppable checks. White probably could have tried 20.Rd1 instead.} Bxd4+ 21. Kh1 {White should have tried 21.Qf2 to stop this.} Qc6 22. g4 {22.g4?? or 22.Qf3. 22.g4?? is a waste of time. Sadly, if white thinks he has time to distract me at this point, he will be astonished by these shocking next moves.} Qxe4+ {22...Qxe4+!! makes this mate unstoppable.} 23. Qg2 Qxb1+ 24. Qg1 Qxg1# {This is an example of what not to do with a great opening.}
