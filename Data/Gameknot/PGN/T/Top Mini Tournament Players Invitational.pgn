[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {As usual, my standard.} d5 {Nf6 is also very playable.} 2. Nf3 {Ive been playing around with this move, as it allows a transposition into the QGA (one of my standards) while also preparing 0-0 a little faster than the "normal" response of 2. c4.} f5 {Here, the first thought I had was that my opponent's name was very fitting. I can tell that he plans to dominate e4 and that Nf6 is coming very soon. I must admit, at this point I was a little concerned. My opponent is stronger than I, and I am now out of my "book".} 3. Bf4 {Developing my dark squared bishop in such a way that I can play e3. I really don't have a sense of where this game is going yet, but realize that maintaining my lead in development should be one of my priorities.} e6 {?! I really expected Nf6. While it is still very early, start keeping an eye on black's light squared bishop. It is very weak, and needs to be exploited.} 4. e3 {I also considered Nbd2, with the idea of playing Rc1 and then pushing my c pawn. I opted for e3, however, as it hastens castling.} Bd6 {Black finally develops a piece, and begs me to exchange it off. As my own dark squared bishop is somewhat threatened by an aggressive (yet risky) play of g5, I opt to oblige him. In doing so, black is faced with the decision of re-taking with his queen or c pawn, and either way his resulting position will be somewhat unbalanced.} 5. Bxd6 Qxd6 {He chooses to re-take with his queen. It is here that I realize that the c5 square is potentially very weak, as he can play Nd7 followed by a very strong c5!} 6. a3 {This move accomplishes 2 things - it prevents Qb4  (threatening b2) and also prepares the threat of playing b4.} c6 {? Not sure what he was planning here. I assumed he would develop a piece - either Nf6, Nd7, or Bd7. I see this move as accomplishing more for me than for him, as his Nb8 is restricted even further.} 7. c4 {Ok - time to start forcing black into making some tough decisions. If he takes, then I develop my light squared bishop with some aggressive tempo. If he doesn't take, I can play c5 (which locks the pawns up and gives me a space advantage on the queenside).} Nf6 {Finally! The e4 square is a very aggressive post, and I know he wants to get this knight there.} 8. c5 {Hello space advantage:)} Qe7 {I think a retreat to c7 was stronger, as Qa5  is a move that I would have to deal with. By making this more passive move, black is allowing me to continue to be the aggressor.} 9. Nc3 {A developing move which hits his destination square of e4.} Nbd7 {I can see him wanting to get developed, but this move even further restricts his light squared bishop. Maybe he intends to play b6? I think 0-0 may have been a stronger play.} 10. Bd3 {Another developing move which hits e4. Now I envision 0-0 for myself with the plan of starting an attack. Where? I have no idea, but I will have a strong lead in development which I can use aggressively.} O-O {Black secures his king, and obviously wants to start raising Cain on the kingside.} 11. b4 {? I guess I just wanted to secure my domination of the queenside. 0-0 was probably a better play though.} a6 {Black is apparently more concerned with my potential queenside domination than he is with his own development. The weakness of his light squared bishop is now foremost in my mind.} 12. a4 {a5 is where this guy needs to be! If I can TOTALLY lock down the queenside, then I can play 0-0-0 to secure my own king and have counterplay against his kingside attack which I can just feel is coming.} Ne4 {Black decides it's time to post that knight. I have two options to take it if I like, but as it is not really threatening anything I can't handle, I feel that it is better to just protect my Nc6 with Qc2 (which hits e4 again) and will allow 0-0-0 as I mentioned.} 13. Qc2 Qf6 {Man, his light squared bishop (and by extension, his Ra8) sure are weak!} 14. Nd2 {I figure a fourth hit on e4 can't be all bad, and playing f4 if he allows it will be strong.} g5 {Here comes the attack. While my intended f4 is now not feasible, I see an even better option. Kick out his Ne4 and I can have a lot of ammo pointed towards his king.} 15. f3 Nxc3 {Practically forced.} 16. Qxc3 Qg6 {While it is obvious this move was intended to create a square for his knight to move to, it also creates a pin of his f pawn against his queen.} 17. e4 {! Threatening e5! and also pressuring the pin I just mentioned. The risk, however, is that my kingside can be weakened. I really want to play 0-0-0 SOON!} fxe4 {He bites.....} 18. fxe4 Qh5 {Escaping the pin and preventing my 0-0-0, but it allows.............} 19. e5 {! Black's problem child, his light squared bishop, is all but worthless. It will take forever to develop it to a useful square now.} Rf7 {Again, trying to find a place for his knight.} 20. Be2 {Time to prepare for 0-0-0, while throwing in a nice little queen attack as well.} Qh6 {Escaping the attack of the bishop, but walking into...........} 21. Qe3 {Another ugly pin that he must deal with.} Nf8 {Black now hopes to get his knight into play via g6.} 22. Nf3 {Threatening to win the g pawn after Qxg, QxQ, NxQ.} Rf4 {! Black finds an interesting interposition. If he can play Re4 he may have some serious threats.} 23. g3 {I took a while on this move. I realized after much thought that I had no real fear of him playing Re4, as it could be easily sidestepped.} Re4 24. Qd2 {Notice that the pin is still effective.} Rg4 {A seemingly strong move which protects his weakened "isolated" pawn.} 25. O-O-O {Finally! Now I have some resources to get moving on the kingside.} Qg7 {Solving the problem of the "isolated" pawn.} 26. Rdg1 {! Realizing a 5-3 piece advantage on the kingside, I prepare to launch an overwhelming attack. Notice that this was the correct rook to place on g1, as the other will be need on the h file.} h6 {? This just weakens black's position. Better was Ng6.} 27. h4 {!! take a minute and look at the capturing possibilities in this position should he play gxh.} Ng6 {Too little too late. No matter what, white will come out on top after the carnage of the next few moves.} 28. hxg5 hxg5 29. Nxg5 Rxg5 30. Qxg5 {Black is now seriously on the ropes.} Ne7 {Following general theory, white starts eliminating pieces while he has the advantage.} 31. Qxg7+ Kxg7 32. g4 {! Preventing Nf5, which could cause serious headaches for white.} Bd7 {32 moves into the game and black finally moves his light squared bishop. Notice that it still isn't doing much however. Black must get his Ra8 into the mix if he is to have any chance of achieving at least a draw.} 33. Bd3 {Still somewhat concerned about blacks knight, white begs him to move to g6.} Ng6 {Thank you!} 34. Bxg6 Kxg6 35. Rgf1 {This move achieves almost total control of the areas around the enemy king.} Rg8 {I guess black wanted to try to get to my g pawn eventually, but he has no time to do so.} 36. Rf6+ Kg7 {Kg5 may have bought a little more time. Now it is just a matter of technique.} 37. Rhf1 Bc8 {Black is overly concerned with the protection of his e pawn. Be8 was better.} 38. Rf6f7+ {The check is just gravy - my goal is to get the black king away from f8.} Kg6 39. Rf7f8 Kg7 40. Rf1f7+ {While I can't mate him right this instant, I can win the bishop.} Kh8 41. Rxg8+ Kxg8 42. Rc7 {And a dagger through the heart of the problem bishop. Fitting, as it caused so many problems for black this game. I feel this game shows how a singular weakness on the part of your opponent can be repeatedly attacked and reinforced in such a way that strong mating attacks will eventually come to life. I hope you have enjoyed:) - Thomas}
