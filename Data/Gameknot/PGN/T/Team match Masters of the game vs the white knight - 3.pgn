1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Qc7 4. O-O Nf6 5. Re1 e6 6. c4 {A bit of an odd move, I suppose. I decide I wanted to try taking control over the a1-h8 diagonal, while constraining black's advancement in the centre. It is concerning that I block my white bishop, forcing me to trade with his knight, although at least that makes it harder for my opponent to make use of my newly created weak square d4.} Ng4 7. Bxc6 {With my strategic plan of taking the dark bishop to b2, keeping the white bishop as a reasonable peace would require a couple of moves to get it to c2, before I get to play b3. Trading off therefore seemed best.} bxc6 8. b3 Bd6 9. h3 Be5 {black tries to take advantage of my slow plan for development of the queen side, but it is not as concerning as it may seem, as we will soon see....} 10. Nxe5 {taking the opposing dark bishop off the board will make mine that much more powerful once it gets optimally placed.} Qxe5 {Nxe5 would have been better, although I should be easily able to defend square d3 with Re3 (and in case of a following Qe6 with Qc2) after which black has little opportunities to apply pressure, allowing me to develop a dangerous attacking position with a bishop on b2 and possibly a rook on g3, or a pawn advancement to f4} 11. Qxg4 {Winning a piece. Qxa1 does not concern me because.....} Qxa1 12. Nc3 {And the queen is trapped! I can spend the next few turns calmly collecting it by securing the rook and playing Ba3} O-O 13. Rd1 f5 14. Qe2 {I would rather give up the pawn than opening the position, since black's queen will trade with my rook and the more the position is closed, the less his two rooks will be able to compensate for the lack of a queen.} fxe4 15. Ba3 Qxd1+ 16. Nxd1 {I would be much happier with a knight on d4 than c3, so I take with the knight here to start its journey to that square.} d5 17. Bxc5 Rf6 18. Ne3 a5 19. Nc2 a4 20. Nd4 {Now both of my light pieces are nicely placed on dark squares that black will have difficulty to contest.} axb3 21. axb3 Ra1+ 22. Kh2 Bd7 23. Qg4 {Black's rooks may now soon get annoying on the second row, but if I get my queen to g3, it can get very active on the dark squares that are weak for black} Ra2 24. cxd5 cxd5 25. Bb4 {I traded first because I didn't want to allow black access to d2 too easily through 24 Bb4, c5 25. Bxc5, Rxd2.} Rxf2 26. Qg3 {Didn't really care about the pawn, since I gain a tempo while getting my queen more active.} Raxd2 {Seems like a last ditch attempt to create some danger with connected passed pawns with an exchange sacrifice. While this in itself is already rather unconvincing, a little combination makes it even worse....} 27. Bxd2 Rxd2 28. Qb8+ Kf7 29. Qf4+ {And black resigns. Let me know what you think, especially about the annotation, since this was my first and I surely have much to learn about it.}
