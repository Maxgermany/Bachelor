1. c4 {Once upon a time there was a queen. She had an insatiable appetite! She couldn't resist taking pieces whenever she could. This is a warning to you dear reader, of how such behaviour can get you into trouble!} e6 {This game was played in the "England plays the English tournament", where every game has to start 1. c2-c4. However we quickly transpose back into a mainline Queen Pawn opening.} 2. d4 {So I play d4} d5 {He transposes into the Queen's Gambit Declined. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Gambit_Declined)} 3. Nc3 {And I play the most common continuation.} c6 {With possible transposition to the Cambridge Springs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Gambit_Declined,_Cambridge_Springs_Defense) or the semi-slav (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Slav_Defense)} 4. e4 {I seize the centre.} dxe4 {He takes.} 5. Nxe4 {I recapture.} Bb4+ {He throws in a check.} 6. Bd2 {I block with my bishop.} Qxd4 {The greedy queen takes the first pawn! This is a well-known sacrifice by white. One of no less than four gambits named after the great attacking American player, Frank Marshall. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Gambit } 7. Bxb4 {So i take the bishop.} Qxe4+ {He takes the knight, otherwise he is just a material down.} 8. Be2 {This is the riskiest continuation, offering a pawn. It also sometimes leads to a fascinating variation, starting 8.....Nb8-a6, 9. Bf8?! and the bishop cannot be taken otherwise Qd8 mate!} Qxg2 {But the greedy queen takes another pawn!} 9. Qd6 {So I threaten a horrible check on f8.} Nd7 {And he defends} 10. O-O-O {I get my king to safety. Now the greedy queen realises if she eats the rook on h1, then Bf3 will trap her, as the white queen protects h2. So she eats something else.} Qxf2 11. Bf3 {So I block the queen's retreat. Believe it or not, this has all been seen before, and I reached this position with white having been following the opening databases on Gameknot. This position is roughly equal. Although white is 3 pawns down, it is hard for black to complete his development.} Qe3+ {With this check, I am taken out of the opening databases.} 12. Kb1 {So it seems sensible to put the king to a safer square.} Qg5 {The queen moves back. I now make a terrible mistake. I play Nh3, thinking that if Qf5, attacking bishop and knight, then I have Bg2 protecting the knight. I didn't see that Qf5 is check!} 13. Nh3 {So I hit the queen.} Qf5+ {He does this move and suddenly I am thinking "Help, I am losing to a 1304!"} 14. Ka1 {So my king goes to the corner, completely safe at last. The post-match computer analysis prefers Rd3 with "only" 1.5 advantage to black instead of 4.06.} Qxf3 {He takes the bishop.} 15. Ng5 {I hit the queen. Now I think Qh5 is best for him, as then he attacks my knight. Maybe I play h4 protecting it, maybe he then drives it back with h6. I basically losing. But the queen's hunger is the undoing of the black position.} Qe2 {He targets the c4 pawn. I looked carefully at Rh-e1 here, and then after he moves the queen, sacrificing with either rook or knight on e6, but they don't seem to work, so I decide to target another weakness.} 16. Rhf1 {I target f7. Now he must do something about and it is not easy. Of course Nh6?? allows Qe7 mate. If the f pawn moves, then I can play Rf1-e1 and take on e6 after he moves his queen. I think best is to return some of the sacrificed material with Qh5 and sacrificing queen and pawn for rook and knight, when I take on f7. He would then still be materially up, but his backward development and my actve pieces give me the better position, for example Qh5 17.	Rxf7	Qxf7 18. Nxf7 Kxf7 19.	Rf1+	Ngf6 20. Qe7+ Kg8 21.	Qxe6#	} Qxc4 {But the greedy queen takes her last piece!} 17. Rxf7 {I take, threatening mate in two moves in three different ways!} a5 {He hits my bishop.} 18. Rf8+ {I elect for this finish.} Nxf8 {Forced!} 19. Qd8# {And mates! Please feel free to comment on this annotation, and the game. Please rate my annotation with the star system. Many thanks for reading this. Until next time dear reader!}
