1. e4 {Hi everyone!  After a run of bad losses it is nice to talk about a win, especially one which involves Glenda The Defender in the position of her dreams!  Well they certainly came true in this one.  Watch this space.  Gameknot Analysis is provided for this game (which starts off as a Sicilian Naijdorf) as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16118151&fb=1&rnd=0.03013906409039291} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {5. ..... a6 - this little move is the Sicilian Naijdorf.  Moves 1-5 are pretty standard Sicilian moves.  A b5 pawn push/queenside pawn storm invariably follows from this.} 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. f3 Be6 {8. ..... Be6 - development and black may want to take the knight giving me isolanis at the right moment.} 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O {10. 0-0-0 - you would never believe that over the next few moves, black's king which looks safely tucked away is gonna be subject to a massive line-opening pawn storm.} Nbd7 11. g4 {11. g4 - are you all sitting comfortably?  Now it all begins!} b5 12. g5 b4 {12. ..... b4 - black gets one going as well but I just happen to be a few jumps ahead.} 13. Ne2 Ne8 14. f4 {14. f4 - after both knights retreat the kingside pawn storm begins anew.} a5 15. f5 Bxb3 16. cxb3 {16. cxb3 - the B for N trade is forced.  Henry is opened up on the c column but thankfully this does not prove to be a problem.} Nc5 17. Ng3 Qc8 18. Kb1 {18. Kb1 - Henry sorts it by moving to b1 out of the threatened discovery Nxe4+.} Nc7 19. f6 {19. f6 - here comes a line opening pawn sac of which black accepts.} gxf6 20. gxf6 Bxf6 21. Nh5 {21. Nh5 - bringing a piece into the vicinity of the BK and attacking black's dsb on f6.} Nxe4 22. Qg2+ {22. Qg2+ - as you can see, a second white pawn has dropped but that one was very toxic indeed.  Here comes Glenda!} Kh8 23. Qxe4 {23. Qxe4 - Glenda turns that annoying steed into dust and I am now a N for 2 pawns up.} d5 24. Qf3 Bg7 25. Nxg7 {25. Nxg7 - my knight knocks out the defensive bishop on the g column.} e4 26. Qf6 {26. Qf6 - Glenda moves in to threaten a nasty discovery (Ne8+).} Qg4 27. Ne8+ {27. Ne8+ - of which I carry out.} Kg8 28. Bb5 {28. Bb5 - the bishop is en prise on this square but I am not too fussed.  Fou Leblanc defends the knight on e8 but more importantly the Wicked Witch of the West is perfectly in line for a pin on the g column.  If the Witch now moves off the diagonal then black can cop Old Matey at Her Majesty's Pleasure!} Qg6 29. Rhg1 {29. Rhg1 - pin.} Nxe8 30. Bxe8 Raxe8 31. Bh6 {31. Bh6 - no need for the rook to eat the Witch yet.  Might as well get a piece in to ensure that black really does cop Old Matey.} Re6 32. Rxg6+ {32. Rxg6+ - now the rook eats the Witch.  If you have ever played Battle Chess you will see that when the rook captures the queen - he eats her alive!} hxg6 33. Qg7# {33. Qg7 MATE!! - yup, there it is, Glenda in all her splendour is doing what she always wanted to do, give the enemy king that kiss of death, aaah.  Now there is another player, a certain Master that Glenda would just lurve to do this to - I will leave you to guess who!}
