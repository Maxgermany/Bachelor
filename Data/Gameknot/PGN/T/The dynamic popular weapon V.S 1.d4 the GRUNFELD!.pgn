1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {  This opening is called the Grunfeld which is popular with people who want   to counter attack with the Black pieces. It is Bobby Fischer's and Garry Kasparov's they use it as a dynamic and popular weapon!   3.d6 however is the King's Indian Defence ( KID)} 4. Nf3 {Other options for White are;  A) 4.cxd5 Exchange variation. Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 (black plays 7.c5) B)    The fairly quiet system 4. e3.  C)  4. f3 which is met by 4.c5. D)  4. h4  4.c5. E)   4.Qb3 dxc4 5. Qxc4 Bg7. F)   4. Bg5 which should be met with 4. Ne4 apparently.} Bg7 { The sniper rifle is set!} 5. Bf4 { The lines with 4. Bf4 can usually be dangerous for Black, mostly because of the slight move order nuances oblige different types of reaction to movesof which look very similar. But however, there is no real theoretical danger for Black and a well-prepared player will have very good chances in this line.} O-O { 5. c5 6. dxc5 Qa5  7. cxd5 Nxd5  8. Qxd5 Bxc3   9. Bd2!  ( note that if White played 4.e3 instead of 4.Nf3 then he would not be able to play 9.Bd2 because the e3 pawn would have been in the way) 9. Be6 ( if 9.Bxd2  10.Qxd2 Qxc5 11.Rc1 Qf5 12. Nd4 Qd7 13. Qh6 which is good for White because Black has some serious coordination problems and weak dark sqaures on the King side.    10. Qxb7 Bxd2  11. Nxd2 0-0 12. b4!  Qa4 13. e3! worked very well in the Van- Wely Kamsky, Groningen in 1995.} 6. Rc1 { 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 8. Bxc7 Nc6 9. e3  Bf5 gives Black more than compensation for the pawn because of his impressive lead in development.} dxc4 { !  Rc1 indicates nothing but a warning not to play 6.c5.   6. Nh5 is met by 7.Be5!.} 7. e4 {7. e3 is much less threatning of course because and Black can secure a good game by playing 7. Be6! 8. Ng5!? is the only danger move ( 8.Nd2 c5! 9. dxc5 Nbd7 and Ne5 c5! are definately O.K for Black) After 8. Bd5 9. e4 h6 10. exd5 hxg5 11. Bxg5 Nxd5 12. Bxc4 Nb6 13. Bb3 Nc6 White should then rely on using the bishop matching pair and also the h pawn and support the d4 pawn because it is weak. } Bg4 { 7. b5 is also possible and it is also theory.} 8. Bxc4 { Recapturing the pawn, developing a piece and also preparing to 0-0.} Nh5 {Black's opening strategy here is to capture the Knight on f3 and make him end up with doubled pawns which should give him an endgame advantage.} 9. Be3 {Bishop retreats.} Bxf3 { } 10. gxf3 { 10. Qxf3 Bxd4 11. g4 Ng7 12. Rd1 Nc6.} e5 {This move completely neutrilizes White's opening system. Black srikes at the centre right away and also highlights the weekness of the f4 sqaure and also stops white playing f4.  10.. e6 however keeps all the tension in the position} 11. dxe5 { 11. d5 is very anti-positional because. It restricts White's bishops and also    gives Black a forever outpost on f4.} Bxe5 {11. Qh4!? is worth a try especaily at club level. After 12.e6 fxe6 13.Bxe6  Kh8. Black has some dark square compensation and White has to be very careful. Black's plans are Nc6-e5, Be5 and Nf4 and White's King will have a problem.} 12. Qxd8 {12. Qb3!? is another possibility but I am not sure about it.} Rxd8 {Now have a look at this position before you continue. Black has many possibilities for creativity, Black's opening play is a definate success. White has the advantage of the 2 Bishops but on the other hand he has bad pawn structure. White has some ways to build the pressure up here. It is also easy for White to screw up here because without his 2 bishops there is nothing at all good about his position. Blacks target now is to try and swap one of White's Bishops off.} 13. Ne2 { After 13. 0-0 Nd7 intending Nf8- e6 and pawn to c6. 13. Nc6 is much more chunky though.} Nc6 14. O-O { 14. f4 Bxb2 15. Rb1 Ba3 16. Rxd7 Rab8 17. Rxb8 Rxb8 looks good for Black since Na5 is very effective if White does 0-0.} Nd4 { !   Keeps control of the game. If White was allowed to play f4,e5 and then Ng3 Black would be in a LOT of trouble.} 15. Nxd4 { } Bxd4 { Recapture.} 16. Bd5 { This move blocks the d8 Rook from supporting the Bishop on d4. An exchange is in action here. 16. Be5 is also possible 17. Bxb7 Rab8 18. Bd5 Rxb2 19. Bxa7 Nf4 and it is anyone's game!!} Bxe3 17. fxe3 { Recapture.....} c6 { Threatning the Bishop.} 18. Bb3 { It retreats.....} Rd2 { Bang!! the Rook is always strong on the 7th rank especaily when doubled because they act as battering rams and the King will be restricted can't get out easily.} 19. Rf2 { A Rook exchange will be good for White because there will no longer be any Black Rook on the 7th rank and there will never will be.} Rad8 { Keeping the pressure and supporting the Rook on d2.} 20. Rc2 { White is now threatning to win a Rook because the Black Rook is being attacked twice and only being defended once.} Rxc2 {Not  a happy choice for Black because he will no longer have a Rook on the 7th Rank. But it was forced.} 21. Rxc2 { Recapture...} Kf8 { Black gets his King ready for action because it is the endgame stage.} 22. Kf2 { White does the same.} Ke7 { Black has a slight advantage though he should consider getting the Knight to e6 where it would be stronger.} 23. Ke2 Ng7 24. e5 Ne6 25. f4 f6 { Gives the King some room. White can't push his passed  e-pawn without creating weaknesses.} 26. exf6+ { The best reply.} Kxf6 { recapturing the pawn.} 27. h4 Ng7 28. e4 Ne6 29. Ke3 Rd1 30. Bxe6 {White stops himself from trying TOO hard to win just in time and they agreed a draw. The Rook endgame is equal. Still either side can try to win. But there is a really serious risk of losing the game.  GOOD GAME!! I thought anyway. Shows you what the Grunfeld is all about.  Soon I might annotate another game with the Grunfeld.  I hoped you guys enjoyed the game and expect to see another game soon!  }
