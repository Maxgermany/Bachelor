[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {I open with Queens pawn d4.} e6 {He opens with e6} 2. e3 {I play e3  to back up d4.I also do this to start my control of middle and develope my pieces.Also i have been studying about pawn chains.I am trying to learn how to do this in conjunction with my "face pieces"} d5 {He plays d5 blocking my d4 pawn we are trying to develope middle.} 3. f4 {I bring out f4 this way i have e5 covered with "crossfire" from d4 and f4.I also have c5 and g5 covered.} Nf6 {He plays Nf6.With this move  i think he will bring out his other knight on his next move.I see that my g4 and e4 are probably in danger.If he makes it to these squares i believe it could be diasterous for me.But on the otherhand such a move would probably be bad for him because he is to far from backup} 4. Nc3 {I play Nc3.With this move i develope more and cover e4,b5,and a4.This move also helps me take more control  of my left.} Be7 {He moves Be7.I think moving on out to Bb4,Bc5 or Bd6 would have been better for him.} 5. Nf3 {I bring my other cowboy into play.I believe with this move i am way ahead of him on developement} Bd7 {He moves to Bd7.I believe he does this hoping to attack me on left with his Bishops} 6. Qd3 {I bring my Lady to dance.I think i need to work on bringing her out later in games after i have developed my other face pieces.But later this early move pays off} Nc6 {He now brings in his other cowboy.} 7. Bd2 O-O {He castles here.} 8. Ng5 {I move Ng5 i feel there is a weak spot here.} Ng4 {He moves Ng4.If you look here i should have moved to Qxh7 this would have been the checkmate i needed.I think he is attacking my right.I focus on his knight this could have been a fatal mistake for me.} 9. O-O-O {I castle here.If he had moved from g7 to g6 it would have changed the game.} Nb4 {He comes on down with his cowboy Nb4.} 10. Qxh7# {I finally see the weakness and i dropped the hammer!}
