1. e4 {Hi everybody.  Over the past few days I have been playing a game with a very strong near-Master called Lighttotheright (Ken).  He decided to kick off with e4 and play the Vienna Gambit.  I accepted it but was it the right thing to do?  The jury is out as the action unfolds.} e5 2. Nc3 {2. Nc3 - this move characterises the Vienna Game.  Instead of attacking the pawn on e5 the knight defends the pawn on e4.} Nf6 3. f4 {3. f4 - the Vienna Gambit.} exf4 {3. ....... exf4?! - The Vienna Gambit Accepted.  This is not a good acceptance though because the knight on f6 can be driven back by the pawn thrust e5 as I found out to my chagrin on move 4.  Black therefore loses tempo grabbing the f pawn - not very good against a player 400 points north of my rating.    Ken had this to say about that move:- Instead of 3. ... exf4, d5 was more appropriate. It is sharper, but it tends to give White more problems. ***** This variation is somewhat more similar to the King's Gambit. I already much prefer White's position. But we are still well within established theory. You still have plenty of chances to defend adequately.My punishment, however, was not overly severe as you will find when you read on.} 4. e5 Ng8 5. Nf3 {5. Nf3 - development - and black has no pieces out.  Over the next couple of moves I find I need to move pawns in order to facilitate piece development.} d6 6. d4 dxe5 7. Qe2 {7. Qe2 - the Wicked Witch of the West comes to e2 - although she blocks in the white lsb she causes major problems in pinning my e pawn.  I look at the db options and I realise that if I choose Be6 which seems the best of the bunch I see a very nasty queen fork on b5 where the b7 pawn will fall leaving a gaping hole in my queenside pawns.  No thank you!  So I rack my brains and come up with c6 - another pawn move.  Now Ken picks off the gambited pawns.} c6 8. Bxf4 Be6 9. Bxe5 Nf6 {9. ........ Nf6 - while Ken has regained his material I have spent those moves getting a couple of pieces out and trying to catch up in my development.} 10. Ng5 Bb4 {10. ....... Bb4 - Fou Lenoir clears the way for kingside castling and pins Ken's Queen Knight.} 11. Nxe6 fxe6 {11. ....... fxe6 - the e pawn crucially becomes an isolani of which Ken will exploit next turn.} 12. Bxb8 Bxc3+ {12. ....... Bxc3+ - this in-between move busts up Ken's queenside pawn structure before I take off his dsb.} 13. bxc3 Rxb8 14. Qxe6+ {14. Qxe6+ - I am about to lose a pawn though.} Qe7 {14. ........ Qe7 - Glenda blocks the check and pins the Witch to Ken's king.  A queen trade ensues and I find myself in a double rook + piece ending a pawn minus.} 15. Qxe7+ Kxe7 16. Bd3 Rhe8 {16. ........ Rhe8 - centralisation.} 17. Kd2 Kf8 {17. ....... Kf8 - Ken had this to say about this move:- "17.... Kf8?? You needed to centralize the King instead with Kd6."  } 18. Rae1 Rxe1 19. Rxe1 Re8 {19. ....... Re8 - that was why I played Kf8 the previous move.  I was hoping to simplify into a piece ending and hope that my horsie would somehow exploit the white pawn mess on the queenside.  But it was not to be.  Ken moved his rook to b1.} 20. Rb1 Re7 {20. ...... Re7 - guarding the attacked b pawn.  Would b5 have been an improvement though?} 21. c4 Ke8 22. c5 h6 23. c4 {23. c4 - pawn roll.} Kd8 {23. ....... Kd8 - Henry feels he is needed on the queenside.} 24. a4 a5 {24. ...... a5 - to try and seal up one side of the board, the start of another Operation Joblock perhaps?  Note that I am trying to fix Ken's pawns on the white squares.  Doesn't last though.} 25. Bf5 Kc7 26. Kd3 g5 27. g4 h5 28. h3 h4 {28. ...... h4 - white has spent the last few moves improving his position.  I thought about exchanging h for g pawn but then it would open a line for white's rook.  My own rook is trying to keep the WK confined to the queenside and away from snaffling up my kingside pawns.} 29. Rf1 Nd7 30. Bxd7 Kxd7 {30. ........ Kxd7 - piece trade.} 31. d5 cxd5 32. cxd5 {32. cxd5 - pawn trade.} Ke8 33. d6 {33. d6 - the d6 pawn becomes a menace.  My rook sidestepps and now comes a killer move.} Re6 34. Rb1 {34. Rb1.  There is no saving my b7 pawn and Ken will crown at least one of those advanced passers and I would have to sac my rook just to stop one of them, so I waved the white flag.  Well played Ken!}
