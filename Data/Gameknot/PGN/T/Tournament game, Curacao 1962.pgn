1. e4 c5 2. Ne2 d6 {Fischer loved to play the Sicilian Defense as Black.} 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O {Keres adopts a rather passive response.} Nc6 6. c3 e5 7. d3 Nge7 {The game is perfectly level.} 8. a3 O-O 9. b4 b6 10. f4 exf4 11. gxf4 {The Pawn exchange has slightly exposed Keres' King.} d5 12. e5 Bg4 {Fischer always was aggressive.} 13. h3 Bxe2 14.

Nxf1 {Keres has an endgame weakness now -- a flank minority on the K-side. If Fischer can reach an endgame he can push his K-side pawns.} Nb3 19. Rb1 Nxc1 20. Rxc1 {Every exchange brings the endgame closer.} Qc7 21. Re1 Rd8 22. Nh2 d4 23. cxd4 cxd4 {Artificially isolating the White KP.} 24. Nf3 {24 N-N4 was better.} Bh6 25. Qa2+ Kh8 26. Qe6 Nd5 {Fischer returns the favor. 26...N-B4 was correct.} 27. Nh2 Ne3 28. Bc6 {Sealing off the attack route of Black's Queen.} Rf8 29. Nf3 Bf4 {The game is even. Both sides have winning chances.} 30. Nxd4 Bxe5 31. Nf3 Bd4 {Hoping for 32 NxB?? Q-N6 ch!} 32. Rxe3 Bxe3+ 33. Qxe3 Qg3+ 34. Kf1 Qxh3+ {Fischer now has connected passed Pawns on the K-side.} 35. Ke1 Qf5 36. d4 Kg7 37. Kf2 {Trying to keep close to the dangerous Black pawns.} h5 38. Kg3 Qg4+ 39. Kh2 Rf4 {Fischer presses on.} 40. Qe7+ Kh6 41. Qe2 Qf5 42. Qe3 g5 {The Pawns continue to advance.} 43. Kg2 Rg4+ 44. Kf2 Rf4 45. Kg2 Qc2+ {Fischer tries to break the King's blockade.} 46. Kh1 Qb1+ 47. Kh2 Qa2+ 48. Kh3 Qf7 49. Kh2 Qf6 50.

Nh2 Qg5 {Pressuring Keres further. The move to hold the position is 56 Q-K5 ch.} 56. Nf1 {A potentially disastrous blunder. . Now Fischer can win with 56...

Qb4+ {Keres seeks to force a perpetual check.} Kf7 {Seeking shelter.} 70. Qb3+ Kg7 71. Qg3+ {Still trying for the checks.} Kh7 {This appears to be the winning move for Fischer. Keres is out of Queen checks. Fischer's Pawn is about to promote. And if Keres tries to win the Pawn with 72 B-B5 ch QxB 73 QxP, Fischer has 73... Q-B5 ch! 74 Q-N4 QxQ ch 75 KxQ K-N3! seizing the Opposition with an easily won King and Pawn ending. Can you find Keres' miracle move to salvage the draw?} 72. Qe5 {If you found 72 Q-K5!!! you get full marks. The only move to save the game for Keres.} Qh1+ 73. Bh3 { If 73... P-N8 (Q), 74 Q-R5 ch! forces a draw.} Qxh3+ 74. Kxh3 g1=Q {The game is now an easy draw.} 75. Qe7+ Kh8 76. Qf8+ Kh7 77. Qf7+ {Draw agreed. If Fischer tries 77...Q-N2, 78 QxQ ch KxQ 79 K-N3 gives Keres the Opposition. }
