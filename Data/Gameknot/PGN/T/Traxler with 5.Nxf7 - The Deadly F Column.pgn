1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It had been a long time since I last played a game with Coach Ion.  The last time I played him I was lucky to get a High Draw against him.  I found out he was playing in the Traxler so I decided to join it!  I am playing him at the moment but, I can report, that I have managed to get my first win of the tournament against a Class C Player with the black pieces.  I ended up investing an enormous amount of material (-9 the equivalent of a whole queen down) but my opponent lost his king so it was worth it.  Gameknot analysis has been requested and you will find the game in my past games profile.  } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 {4. ..... Bc5 - this move is the Traxler Variation of the Two Knights Defense.} 5. Nxf7 Bxf2+ {5. ..... Bxf2+ - this piece sac is done to open up the f file for a mating attack.} 6. Kf1 Qe7 7. Nxh8 {7. Nxh8 - Knight eats rook and my bishop is en prise.  It looks as if I am hopelessly lost - all is not quite what it seems however.} Bb6 {8. ...... Bb6 - recommended move in the World DB.  Preserving Fou Lenoir on that long diagonal attacks the f 2 square.  I just need to do something with my king knight to open up that f column.} 8. d3 d5 9. Bxd5 Bg4 {9. ..... Bg4, Fou Leblanc develops with a tempo, clearing the queenside for Henry to castle and attacks the Wicked Witch of the West.} 10. Qd2 Nxd5 11. exd5 O-O-O 12. dxc6 {12. dxc6? - tempting to grab the knight but it is not a good move as the WK is now dangerously exposed on that f column.} Rf8+ 13. Ke1 Qf6 {13. ..... Qf6 - Glenda now orchestrates a deadly pile up on the f column.} 14. cxb7+ Kxb7 15. h3 {15. h3??? - this blunder seals white's fate.  No doubt white intended for Fou Leblanc to be chased off the h5-d1 diagonal, but Glenda has other ideas.  I now announced #3 and my opponent waved the white flag.  Gameknot analysis will give the mating sequence.  I hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne} Qh4+ {}
