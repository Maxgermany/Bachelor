1. e4 {A game from gameknot, that I needed to win for a mini tournament 1st place. GK computer analysis available here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=26085158&fb=1&rnd=0.8105011886182563 } e5 2. d3 {A bit passive, this block white bishop. At least, we are out of books.} Nc6 3. c3 d5 {kind of reflex when opponent plays c3. The queen can be centralized without tempo loss after Nc3.} 4. Qc2 {Avoid queen exchange in case of dxe, and keep an eye on e4 and f2.} Be7 5. g3 {Computer gave a ?!. Well, white still didn't develop bishop nor knight, and both f3 and h3 are weaken. So Nf3, Be2 0-0 was better. } Nf6 {Black develop (classic)} 6. Bg2 Be6 7. Nf3 dxe4 8. dxe4 O-O {I didn't play Bc4 preventing rock, because of Nd2, missing that Bd3 attacking the queen was good for black.} 9. O-O {Now Rd1 threaten to take the column, so I leave a place in e7 for the queen and prepare for Re8. Black is a slight edge thanks to better development.} Bc5 10. Nbd2 Qe7 11. Re1 {Inaccuracy. Ng5 to give white bishop pair, then play Nef3 and finish development (Bg5, Rad1 etc...) leads to equality.} Ng4 {This direct f2 attack is annoying. I prefer it to computer's line (Rad8 12.Nb3 Bb6 13. Bg5 where black finish development} 12. Re2 {Protect f2} Rad8 {Take the d-column and intend to reinforce it Rd6 Rfd8 and may be the queen.} 13. h3 {Computer propose b4! Bd6, then h3. In case of Bb6, I assume b5! then after Nb8 pawn in e5 is weak, and so is black "attack".} Nxf2 {According to computer, Bxf2 is an "easy" win : 13. h3 Bxf2+ 14. Kh1 Ne3 15. Qa4 Nxg2 16. Rxf2 Ne3. Alternative 14. Rxf2 leads to game continuation. } 14. Rxf2 {Computer propose 14. b4 Nxe4+ 15. bxc5 Nxg3 16. Re1 Qxc5+ 17. Kh2 Nf5 18. Ne4 Qa5 19. Nfg5 Bd5 20. Bd2 f6 21. c4 Ncd4 22. Bxa5 Nxc2 which is clearly NOT deep enough to conclude.} Bxf2+ 15. Kxf2 Qc5+ {When I played Ng4, I had this position in mind, with Nb4 coming, white king in the center, and a big + in development for black. No mat nor material advantage in mind, just threats.} 16. Kf1 {Computer suggest main line 16. Ke2 Nb4 17. Qb1 (cxN??QxQ) Nd3 18. Kd1 (else Qf2+ then QxB) Qf2 19. Bf1 Nb4 20. Be2 (else Qxf1+ Qd3+ Qxf3+) Nxa2 21. Bd3 (else Bb3+) Qxg3 22. Kc2 Nxc1 where black grab all white kings pawns.} Nb4 17. Qd1 {I considered this the only move to prevent Nd3 followed by Qf2#. Actually after 17. Qa4 Nd3 18. Ke2 Qf2+ 19. Kd1 Qxg2 there is no mat (black is wining still)} Nd3 {?? So focused on the Qf2 threat, I missed the simple Bc4+ that win the queen (knight e2 is pined and if Ke1, then Nd3+ followed by Nxb2+(discovery) and Nxd1)} 18. Qe2 {After this forced defense, there is no clear win. I decided to open the game to take advantage of my better development.} f5 {opening f column, whatever black play. May be less good, but more interesting than grabbing a pawn by Bxa2 (if RxB, NxBc1)} 19. exf5 Bxf5 20. Nb3 {Attack the queen and try to achieve queen side development.} Qd6 {Keep the center (e5 and d3) and "X-ray" g3} 21. g4 {Computer spot this as a mystake, but proposed alternative 21. Kg1 e4 22. Ng5 Qxg3 23. Qe3 Nxc1 24. Qxg3 Ne2+ 25. Kh2 Nxg3 26. Kxg3 Rd3+ seems doomed for white either.} Bg6 {I rejected Nf4 due to Bxf4, missing Bd3 that win the queen. Critical line was â€¦ Nf4 22. Qxe5 (if Qe1 then Bd3+, Ne2+etc...) Qd1+ 23. Ne1 (Kf2? Nd3+ loose Q) Nxg2 24. Kxg2 (else Be4+) Rfe8 25. Bf4 Bb1 26. Rxb1 Qxb1 27. Qxc7 Qxe1 where black ends with 2 rook versus B+N.} 22. Kg1 {According to GK computer, the position is almost equal. I am only confident that it is a big mess ^_^} e4 {Free the way to f2 for the rook.} 23. Ng5 {Nh4 was better, to protect the g2 bishop (and exchange g6 bishop in some variation)} Rf2 {Enter the weak square} 24. Qe3 {Forced to avoid Qg3. But it blocks the c1 bishop.} Rdf8 {Double on the open column} 25. Nxe4 {This lead to a mat in 5. Can you spot it ? According to computer, white is doomed anyway (25. Nd4 Ne1 26. Qxf2 Rxf2 27. Kxf2 Nd3+ 28. Kg1 Qg3 29. Kh1 Qe1+ 30. Kh2 Nxc1 31. Nf5 Bxf5 32. gxf5 Qd2 33. Nxe4 Qxb2 )} Rxg2+ {?? Loose GK hard chess puzzle. Answer was :  25. Nxe4 Bxe4 26. Qf3 R8xf3 27. Bf4 Nxf4 28. Bxf3 Nxh3+ 29. Kh1 Bxf3# I only saw that white queen is forced to sacrifice to prevent Rf2 Qh2# } 26. Kxg2 {There is still a mat in 6} Bxe4+ {I didn't spot the mat in 6. But if QxB Rf2+ with Qh2#.  or if Kh1 move Rf3 leads to the win. So black resign. Thank you for reading, feel free to add your coments and 1 star. ^_^} 27. Kg1 Rf3 {}
