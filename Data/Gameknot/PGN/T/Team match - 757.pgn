1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. f3 {not a good move. it opens the king side too soon.} g6 {maybe e6 was better. my fear is that white will play e5 and than the bishop is useless on g7.} 4. exd5 cxd5 5. Bb5+ Bd7 {Nc6 is better. keep the strong bishop.} 6. Bxd7+ Qxd7 7. Nh3 {??? why h3? why not Ne2?} f6 {wants e5. why not Bg7 with the same idea?} 8. O-O e5 9. Re1 Nc6 {black king is still in the center and its a bit dangerous.} 10. c3 h5 {attackin in the king side.} 11. Nd2 Nh6 12. f4 {??? allowing black to lock the center with e4 and to attack strongly on the king side.} e4 13. Qe2 f5 {an idea: 14.... 0-0-0 15.... Be7 16.... Rdg8 17.... g5.} 14. Nf2 O-O-O 15. h4 Qh7 16. b4 Ng4 17. Nxg4 {???????? very bad move. it opens the h file for black.} hxg4 18. g3 Bd6 19. Nb3 g5 {!! elegant move.} 20. fxg5 Bxg3 21. Rf1 Qxh4 22. Rxf5 Qh1# {the end}
