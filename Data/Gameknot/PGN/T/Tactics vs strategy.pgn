1. e4 {This game was played in round 3 of the 60th GK Tournament, and it was the only game I had concerns about. You'll see why in a few moves.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {I'm always happy to see this move instead of Bb5, which is much more annoying to play against.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 {I have a very good score with this line but that's bound to settle in the near future against stiffer opposition.} a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 {The most crucial approach. My pawn structure is almost compromised but White has problems with his pieces.} gxf6 10. Nd5 f5 11. Bd3 Be6 {A very popular line, thousands of games have been played with this line in the last two decades.} 12. O-O {The sharper 12. Qh5 isn't too fashionable nowadays mainly due to the reply 12...Rg8!} Bxd5 13. exd5 Ne7 {The standard Sveshnikov structure. White could claim a significant edge if his Knight wasn't so poorly placed. } 14. Nxb5 {A pretty rare move. White wins a pawn with the intention of rerouting the Knight to a better square. The downside is that it opens up lines on the Q-side and my Bf8 will be much stronger on the long diagonal. 14. c3 is the more popular move, clearing c2 for the Knight or Bishop, and shutting the long diagonal for the Black Bishop.} Bg7 {14...axb5?? 15. Bxb5+ and White wins the Queen for two pieces. Now axb5 is a serious threat and the Knight has to retreat.} 15. Nc3 {The only place to go but it's good enough. Trying to go back to a3 with the idea of c3 fails to e4 and Bxb2.} e4 {Clearing the diagonal with tempo and forcing the Bd3 to a much less active square.} 16. Be2 {This move was only played once in my database, the more active Bc4 being preferred nine times. The drawback of Bc4 is that it's a little loose on the c-file.} Qa5 {Putting immediate pressure on the Nc3. White's problem is that he can't shake the pressure easily and needs to play quite reserved for a few more moves.} 17. Rb1 {Still in theory. A multi-purpose move. The Rook removes itself from the long diagonal, is poised to become active in case of Bxc3 and aims to drive off the annoying Black Queen with b4.} O-O {A rather poor move but my idea was to keep more pieces on the board. I had drawn a few recent games simply because I exchanged too many pieces and the resulting positions were simple enough for my opponents to defend. It was a risky gamble and by looking at the end result it paid off. If I were to play this line again, I'm sure I would go for the stronger 17...Bxc3 18. bxc3 Qxc3 19. Rb7 (if 19. Rb3 Qe5 with ideas of f4 and attacking on the K-side) Rg8 (a quiet move that forgoes castling in order to activate the Rook on a very dangerous file).} 18. b4 {I wasn't too concerned about this since I knew there was enough tension in the position to keep things balanced, even with a pawn minus.} Qc7 19. Na4 {The pressure on the Q-side evaporated and White has ideas of c4-c5, creating a very dangerous passed pawn. I had to think of something fast. If I play slowly White will certainly convert his extra material. I knew my chances lay on the K-side and that I had to generate initiative there. Notice the opposite colour Bishops. This is a very dangerous middlegame to play and unlike its counterpart in the endgame very much not drawish. The side that can seize the initiative usually wins since the defending Bishop cannot cover the opposite colour squares.} Rfb8 {This looks counter-intuitive to developing an initiative on the K-side but it has some concrete ideas in mind. It clears the f8 square for the Bishop so it may cover c5 and defend against the pawn push, and it also has ideas of a5, activating the Ra8 and using the a-file for counterplay, since White cannot contest that file.} 20. c4 {White carries on with his plan and rightfully so. If there is a good and straightforward plan in a given position that is enough to win, don't bother looking for other subtler ideas. Let your opponent bother with that.} Ng6 {Activating the Knight which now aims for f4 or e5. Still White has a considerable edge here and I'm barely holding on. I just don't have enough counterplay on the K-side to balance the pawn avalanche on the Q-side.} 21. Qc2 {A very direct move. White wants to double on the c-file before pushing c5.} Nf4 {Activating the Knight on a very dangerous square in the vicinity of the White King. } 22. g3 {A very hasty move that gives a lot of the advantage away. Better was 22. Rfd1 but even there I just my hold and it's precisely due to the Nf4 that I'm able to do so. Here is a sample line 22. Rfd1 Rb7 23. c5 (White looks won here but if chess was so simple...) a5! 24. b5 (the only move to play for a win) dxc5 25. b6 Qd6 26. Bb5 Rd8 27. Bc6 Rbb8 28. Qxc5 (it looks resignable here but Black has one good last trick) Qg6 29. g3 Nh3+ 30. Kg2 Qg4 and White can't make progress because his King is suddenly under attack.} Nxd5 {I win the pawn back but White still has a good position. The plan with c5 is still very strong and I still need to be on my toes.} 23. Qd2 Nf6 {I had a very difficult choice about where to put the Knight. I looked at Ne7 and Nb6 but ultimately I felt this was the more fighting move.} 24. c5 {A rushed move. It was wiser to prepare a little more for this move or perhaps refrain from it altogether. White could try to play against my weak d-pawn now that the d-file is open. But it's very hard to shift from one plan to another, especially after you've just lost a pawn and you feel you have to recover fast.} dxc5 {I looked at 24...d5, trying to create a mobile pawn phalanx of my own but it's just too slow to work. So I decided to just liquidate my weak pawn and try to find some other plan.} 25. Nxc5 {Another surprise. I was expecting 25. bxc5 and I still have to watch the passed pawn. White's idea was to bring the Knight to a more active square and win the pawn back. It's a decent idea but against correct play it doesn't yield anything.} Rbd8 {Seizing the d-file and making sure that the Knight doesn't capture on a6 with a fork.} 26. Qg5 {Attacking the f5 pawn. Other moves are slower and I would have time to either play a5 or activate my pieces.} Qe5 {26...a5 is an interesting possibility and after 27. Rfc1 Qe5 28. bxa5 h6 29. Qf4 Qxf4 30. gxf4 Rd2 31. Bc4 Ng4, I'm certainly not worse.} 27. Nxa6 {I didn't understand this move. Why not capture with the Bishop? The Knight was very active on its outpost and now it will have to waste another move to come back into play.} h6 {Getting rid of the very active White Queen.} 28. Qf4 {White is willing to play the endgame now that he has two passed pawns on the Q-side.} Qxf4 {But so am I since my pieces are a little more active and I hope to blockade the pawns on the dark squares thanks to my bishop.} 29. gxf4 Nd5 {A central Knight is an awesome piece. It's attacking two pawns, it's threatening to come to c3 and it also covers b6.} 30. b5 Nxf4 {Recovering the pawn and coming again to the active post near the White Knight. But without the Queens it's far less troublesome. However, the Knight is still the trickiest piece on the chessboard as my opponent was about to discover.} 31. Bc4 Bd4 {I'd say this is fairly balanced, perhaps I am slightly better but White definitely isn't in any danger here. At around this move I was more relaxed about the tournament since I had good positions in all the other games and could afford to draw this game.} 32. b6 {One cannot blame this move but I'd call it rather optimistic. My opponent must have thought he is almost won around here and it's just a matter of time before he queens a pawn on the Q-side.} Rac8 {The only move! But it's good enough to hold. Here I was looking at the endgame resulting from 33. b7 Rxc4 34. b8Q Rxb8 35. Rxb8+ Kg7 and I was rather looking forward to it since I have a lot of piece play for the exchange and White's King is very weak. I knew I couldn't lose this position.} 33. Rfc1 {But I had not thought of winning it either. This move looks very natural but like White's 22nd it fails tactically.} Bxb6 {I saw this was playable almost instantly and after checking the lines a little deeper I was rather happy that I had managed to snag up the pawn and was probably going to win the game.} 34. Rxb6 Ne2+ {The tricky Knight delivers one last killer blow.} 35. Bxe2 Rxc1+ 36. Kg2 Rd2 {The point of the combination. After the Bishop moves e3 is very strong and White will have to give the piece back for the pawn and I will be left an exchange up with a passed f-pawn. White's a-pawn will soon drop and the resulting endgame will be just a matter of time to win.} 37. Rf6 {A rather desperate move. White wants to defend f2 with the Rook and capture a pawn in the process.} Rxe2 38. Rxf5 e3 39. Rf3 Rxa2 {I had calculated 40. Nb4 e2 41. Nxa2 e1Q 42. Nxc1 Qxc1 with a very easy win for Black. The winning plan is to push the f-pawn and squeeze the King into the corner then capture either the f-pawn or the Rook if it goes to a bad square. But White didn't feel like playing anymore and resigned here.}
