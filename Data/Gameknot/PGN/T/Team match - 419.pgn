1. Nc3 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. Qd4 {This is well known from Sicilian dragon - however white is missing the e4 pawn to make it more effective.} Nf6 7. Ne4 Bg7 8. Bg5 O-O {There is not a lot black can do to prevent the double pawn, and it might not be so bad after all.} 9. Bxf6 exf6 10. Nd6 {A really nice place for the night - whites only problem is that he only have a few pices out and have not done the castle yet.} Rb8 {trying to free the black pieces} 11. e4 {A mistake as I see it, due to the move f5, I believe that white should play either Qxa7 (grab a pawn and get out of the bishop line) or Qd2, followed by e3, Bishop out and get the king into protected zone.} f5 12. e5 {A mistake - the classical check on a5 put extra pressure on e5.} Qa5+ 13. c3 Bxe5 14. Nc4 {Nice - but not good enough, black exchange pieces and come out with even more material due to the un-developed white pieces.} Bxd4 15. Nxa5 Re8+ 16. Be2 Bg7 {I was considering Rxb2, but the black bishop is very strong.} 17. Nc4 Ba6 {Again pressure with the bishops using the binding on the king.} 18. Kd1 Bxc4 {It was also good to exchange the rook with the Night and Bishop, but I preferd it this way.} 19. Bxc4 Rxb2 20. Re1 Rxe1+ 21. Kxe1 Bxc3+ 22. Kf1 Rb4 {White resigned, black has 3 pawns and will get the bishop (or rook).}
