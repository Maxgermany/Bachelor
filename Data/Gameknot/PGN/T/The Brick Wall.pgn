[Opening "Benko's opening (A00)"]

1. g3 {This is a common opening played by Grandmasters and is usually followed by 2. Bg2 aiming to 'fianchetto' his Dragon Bishop controlling one of the longest diagonals on the board. Normal replies for Black are 1. ... e5/Nf6/g6 but the most common is 1. ... Nf6 (for Grandmasters).} c6 {!? This move is also great as it aims to block the h1-a8 diagonal with the Caro-Kaan Defence, following with 2. ... d4, so if white plays 2. Bg2 he'll find that his diagonal is blocked and as bishops do not work well in closed positions, his bishop is not much use. This is also a great setup opening to the 'Brick Wall' which you will learn about later. } 2. Bg2 {White sets off his Dragon Bishop, with the task of controlling the longest diagonal on the board, even though he knows that Black is going to play the Caro-Kaan Defence. This is because White aims to use his bishop as a defending piece in the opening and early middlegame, and as an attacking piece in the late middlegame and endgame. } d5 {Black sets up the Caro-Kaan Defence ready to block the bishop's line. Unfortunately, White does not much want an active bishop here at the moment, but hopes to use it in the late middlegame and endgame, as mentioned. The Caro-Kaan Defence is most likely to cause a Brick Wall.  } 3. Nf3 {The bishop now has limited squares to move on so that's why White hasn't cared about the fact that Black was playing the Caro-Kaan Defence.} Bf5 {Black is very much focused on developing the bishop before moving the pawn to e6, ready to form another pawn chain and a Brick Wall. To be honest, it is better to have a bishop behind a pawn chain rather than in front, where it may get easily attacked and will have to move. Also, the central pawns will already be protected by other pawns, so the bishop is just giving it some backup. } 4. O-O {This is a form of 'quiet castling' where no central pawns have been moved, no queenside pieces have been developed and the king knight and king bishop are all close to home, and all the pieces/pawns are no further than the third rank. } Nd7 {Black thinks the opposite, and aims to develop all his queenside pieces and aiming for long-castling, attacking aggressively in the centre. This will occupy a few moves, but is better than not castling at all, of course.} 5. Nc3 {Even though the knight has moved, all the pieces are still close to home and are still no further than the third rank. Still, White aims to develop all the knights before moving any central pawns, and possibly fianchetto the opposing bishop.} e6 {Black aims to form lots of pawn chains, so he can create a Brick Wall where no pieces/pawns can attack him. This is misleading, as pieces on the dark squares will easily get into Black's position. } 6. d4 {White opens up his first central pawn and aims to control the dark squares. Since he has a light squared bishop on g2, it will be difficult to attack white no matter which colour square you are on. } Bd6 {This move enables the bishop to develop to a safe square, and for the queen to come to e7, without blocking the bishop, and also disables White's DSB to come to f4 without messing up his pawn structure. This also guards the Black squares, so no pieces can get into Black's castles.} 7. b3 {White aims to develop his bishop through the c1-a3 diagonal, without blocking any pawns. } Qe7 {Black is now preparing for queenside castling (O-O-O), and develops his queen to a safe square, where it protects the bishop and the knight, and also the f7 pawn. Note that 7. ... Qc7! is just as good, and maybe even better as the queen and bishop may aim at White's kingside.} 8. Bb2 {White has now got control of both long diagonals on the board, and Black will hardly be able to control any after the lines have been opened!} O-O-O {And now Black's plan has been achieved. He has got all his bishops coming into play, his knight controlling the e5 square, his queen in a good position, his king safe, and only the knight on g8 is needed to come into play. } 9. Qd2 {White now connects his rooks and brings his queen into play, onto a safe square, of course. } Ngf6 {Black does the same, and connects his rooks, bringing the knight into play.} 10. e3 {White now forms a pawn chain, making the Brick Wall better than ever. } Rhe8 {Black centralizes his rooks...} 11. Rad1 {And so does white...} Kb8 {Black shuffles along to b8, protecting all three pawns. Note that 11. ... Ba3 was possible, threatening to remove white's 'subordinate' Dragon Bishop, even though there is no rook on c1 (meaning that White had to give up his bishop, no matter what.).} 12. Rfe1 {The other rook comes into play. } g6 {?! This move stops the bishop from retreating, so if a protected pawn attacks the bishop, it has limited squares to go to. } 13. a4 {White extends the Brick Wall to attack Black's queenside, which is not extremely safe.} h5 {Black does the same thing, and marches his pawn down to attack White's kingside (which is extremely safe.)} 14. Qe2 {White aims down at Black's queenside through the f1-a6 diagonal, ready to make attacks in the middlegame. } a6 {And now KA-BLAM! The 'Brick Wall' structure has been completed. All of Black's pawns are on light squares, forming pawn chains. All of White's pawns are also forming pawn chains, and each side is ready for the middlegame, and ready for attack. The question is, how are you going to attack with a Brick Wall in the way?} 15. Ng5 {! This move attacks the kingside, and also prepares for 16. e4! breaking up the pawn structure. Black has no defence!} Nb6 {Black aims to wreck White's queenside. Trouble is, this doesn't help with the Pawn March... } 16. e4 {And here comes the mighty plunge! After 16. ... dxe4 Black loses his biggest trump, the d5 pawn, which breaks the Brick Wall. } dxe4 17. Ngxe4 {I would prefer 17. Ncxe4 so White can still keep the dominant knight on g5.} Nxe4 18. Nxe4 Bxe4 19. Qxe4 {And now the main part of Black's Brick Wall has vanished, but there is still some concrete left over...} f5 {Black hopes to start making a new Brick Wall, and White hopes to get rid of the cement to make it!} 20. Qe2 {The white queen restores back to her home, still aiming to attack Black's queenside.} Bb4 {The centralized Rook needs to move back to f1. That's a shame.  Note: 21. c3 blocks in the DSB, resulting in casualty.} 21. Ref1 {At least the Rooks are still connected, but f1-rook is a little budged in. } Qd6 {?! Hang on, I thought Black wanted to keep the Brick Wall. If Black wants to keep his Brick Wall, surely he needs more pieces to support it, and definitely his queen! Can you work out what's coming next without looking ahead?} 22. Qe5 {That's right. Black's queen is now pinned by the opposing queen. As White has double bishops, and Black has a mixed army, the double bishops will work much more effectively in the endgame, and Black's DSB won't be able to defend the pawns on the light squares!!!} Nd7 {? Black attacks the white queen and also stops the rook exchange after 22. ... Qxe5 23. dxe5 Rxd1 24. Rxd1 and that eliminates a lot of pieces. Trouble is, this doesn't help with the Queen exchange!} 23. Qxd6+ {As White doesn't fancy having a Brick Wall, he is very much concerned about his d4 pawn, as it is the most centralized pawn on the board! } Bxd6 {Forced, or else Black loses the Queen and Bishop, and possibly the game!} 24. c4 {White does not want to form a Brick Wall so he pushes his pawns up, threatening 25 c5!} Bb4 {The bishop returns to the usual square. What a waste, Bishop. } 25. d5 {! The pawn plunges in again, threatening to break the Brick Wall, and threatening to make a passed pawn close to queening! White doesn't have to worry about it as it is defended by another pawn, and a Rook and Bishop!} Nc5 {?? Very tempting. This move ignores the threat and instead makes a threat of Black's own, threatening to take the b3-pawn. This is not very good as Black's Brick Wall will soon be damaged, and White could exchange Rooks, and he would have a passed pawn, and it may queen and checkmate Black!} 26. dxc6 {If Black does not recapture, he loses one pawn. The pawn on c6 is protected by the Bishop on g2. Black is forced to play two worsening moves, either 26. ... bxc6?? or the equally disastrous 26. ... Nxb3??} Nxb3 {?? Black is starting to become tad greedy. Note that the two rooks are hanging, still, but that does not exactly matter. The main thing is that White's pawn will be close to queening, and note that the pawn on c6 is defended by the bishop on g2. A row of disastrous moves follow...} 27. Be5+ {Instead of immediately taking with the pawn, White sends of a check first before taking the pawn again. This enables a strong attacking force for white. This also allows 28. Rb1 skewering knight through bishop, where Black has to reply with 28. ... Rd3, weakening his defences. } Ka8 {?! If 27. ... Kc8?? then 28. cxb7# would be mate. I prefer 27. ... Ka7! which means that White would not take the b7 pawn with check, but instead, take it as normal.} 28. Rxd8+ {Instead of immediately taking the pawn, White inserts a "Zwichenzug", allowing White to take the rook before taking the pawn, which means that White can queen the pawn easily without making just a little bit of profit! 28. ... Kg7?? fails to 29. Rxe8 bxc6 resulting in  White winning nine points, worth a whole queen!  .} Rxd8 {This is turning out to be a lost game for Black after 29. cxb7+ Kg7 30. b8=Q+ Rxb8 31. Bxb8+ Kxb8 32. Rb1 winning heaps of material.} 29. cxb7+ {There is only one safe square to go to. } Ka7 {This game is resign-able for Black following the pawn promotion.} 30. b8=Q+ {Black is forced to capture, but then White would win two points.} Rxb8 {Forced.} 31. Bxb8+ {With the rook gone, White will succeed easily.} Kxb8 {31. ... Kxb8 wins back a bishop, but not 31. ... Kb6? } 32. Rb1 {And White inserts a killer skewer and pin! If the knight moves, the bishop is pinned and if the bishop moves, the knight is pinned, and if the knight moves, the Rook captures the bishop behind, calling check.} a5 {Black moves the pawn to defend the bishop but the knight is lost.} 33. Rxb3 {Say Bye-Bye to the knight!} e5 {Has the Brick Wall collapsed? Not if Black plays properly, though, but the queenside wall has entirely collapsed. } 34. Kf1 {White gets his king into play. Why hasn't Black resigned yet? } e4 {Black storms down his pawns, hoping to queen. } 35. Ke2 {Not so fast!} g5 {Black hopes to exchange at h4...} 36. f3 {...But white exchanges first. } exf3+ 37. Bxf3 h4 {Black threatens to exchange pawns, and white must exchange. } 38. gxh4 gxh4 {The majority of Black's pawns are on the kingside, but the majority of White's pawns are on the queenside. How is Black going to cope with it?} 39. Kd3 {The answer is: HE CAN'T!} f4 {Nice try. } 40. c5 {The white pawn advances one square, the bishop is pinned. } Kc7 {Black gets his king into the game, and releases his bishop. } 41. c6 {The pawn is protected by White's LSB.} Kd6 {Black is trying to stop the pawn from queening, or make threats of his own. That will take some time...} 42. Kc4 {White moves in order to get the rook into the game. } Bc5 {Finally the bishop moves!} 43. Rd3+ {Black is lost, unfortunately. } Kc7 {Good try... } 44. Rd7+ {But, no. And Black's left his bishop hanging. } Kc8 {Another nice one...} 45. Bg4 {But White now sets a discovered check and there is no escape!} Bb6 {Good try to save the bishop...} 46. Rb7+ {...But it's no use. Once the bishop is eliminated, White will queen easily.} Kd8 {Forced.} 47. Rxb6 {Bye Bye Bishop.} f3 {Trying to queen a pawn of yours, eh?} 48. Bxf3 {No such luck!} Kc7 49. Kc5 {Bringing the king up and trying to defend the rook.} Kc8 50. Bg4+ {Forcing the king off the queening square.} Kc7 51. Rb7+ {Forcing the king off the c-file.} Kd8 52. c7+ {Forcing to queen and mate in two (or one) no matter what happens. } Ke7 {52. ... Ke8 fails to 53. c8=Q/R#} 53. c8=Q+ {Another pawn promotes, and it's still check!} Kf6 {Mate in one coming up!} 54. Qf5# {And will you look at such a fancy checkmate, using all three pieces!
