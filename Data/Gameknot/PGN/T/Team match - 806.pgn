1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {I never liked the Italian style...} Bc5 4. c3 {the closed Italian system. I think it gives no advantage to white.} Nf6 5. d3 a6 6. O-O O-O 7. d4 {in my opinion, it weakeness the center. white will be left with the e5 pawn in the middle of the board with not so much defenders on it while black will concentrate his pressure towards it.} Ba7 8. dxe5 Nxe4 {black has 3 developed pieces while white only two. the e5 pawn is kinda weak.} 9. Bd5 Nc5 10. Bg5 {white try to push black. its not a real attack. black will manage soon.} Ne7 11. Re1 Ne6 {and the canter is closed...} 12. Bh4 Qe8 {the e7 knight can move now.} 13. Be4 {no choice. the white bishop is better than the black knight. also, h7 seems a bit weak.} Nc5 {still, want the exchange.} 14. Bc2 Ng6 {the h4 bishop has to find a better place. also, e5 is now threatened twice.} 15. Bg3 Ne6 {now the g3 bishop is kind of stupid. it is really useless. black only needs to find a solution for the c8 bishop.} 16. Nbd2 Qe7 {wants d6...} 17. Ne4 f5 {!! strange but seems to be very strong. after white will take the pawn (e.p.) and black will take with the g pawn, black's d pawn will be a very strong one. also, the c8 bishop will be free and the g file will be a big problem for white.} 18. exf6 e.p. {if not, 18...f4! and no bishop...} gxf6 19. Ned2 f5 {wants f4!} 20. h3 {a must} Qg7 {taking over the g file.} 21. Bb3 {white tries to find a better place for his bishop, apperantly, after Kh8 it is also useless there.} Kh8 22. Bxe6 f4 {! obviously black has the advantage. f4 was a fine move which makes the difference.} 23. Bh2 dxe6 24. Qe2 e5 {wants h3...} 25. h4 {25. Nxe5 is no good because of 25...Nh4!} Bg4 26. Qe4 Rad8 {the second rook has arrived to the party.} 27. h5 Bxh5 28. Qxb7 {a non-important pawn. white, takes his queen out of the center and allows black to take over the king side.} Bb6 29. Qe4 Rfg8 30. Kh1 Bxf2 {what else? white falls apart} 31. Re2 Bh4 32. Nc4 Bf6 33. Qf5 Bxf3 {!! a great move. no moves left for white. the end is near...} 34. gxf3 Rd5 {the d file... white's king is in a poor position.} 35. Rg2 Rgd8 36. Qe6 Qe7 37. Qxa6 Nh4 {wants f3...} 38. Rf2 e4 39. Bxf4 Nxf3 {40... Rd1 or Rh5 are unbearable...}
