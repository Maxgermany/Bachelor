[Opening "Evans gambit (C52), compromised defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {This is the Evan's Gambit- a popular opening in the 1800s, and is still played occasionally today. White gives up material to gain an advantage in development.    } Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 6. d4 exd4 7. O-O d3 {Black did not capture the Pawn on c3 as this would have given more development advantage to white.} 8. Qb3 {Anderssen is not interested in the Pawn on c3. Instead, he eyes up on the black king.  } Qf6 9. e5 Qg6 {Obviously, Dufresne could not capture the e5 Pawn as he would have lost a piece: 9...Nxe5 10. Re1 d6 11. Qa4  forking the King and Bishop.  } 10. Re1 Nge7 11. Ba3 b5 {Rather than defending his own position, Black offers a counter- sacrifice to activate his Queen's Rook with tempo. Here, 11... a6 would have been better.   } 12. Qxb5 Rb8 13. Qa4 Bb6 {Here Black connot castle as he loses a piece after 13... 0-0 14. Bxe7 Nxe7 15. Qxa5.} 14. Nbd2 Bb7 {Dufresne gets the first opportunity in the game to castle, which he ignores. This delay in castling lands him a lot of trouble in the rest of the game.  } 15. Ne4 Qf5 16. Bxd3 Qh5 17. Nf6+ {This is a beautiful sacrifice to open up the lines for attacking the uncastled King.} gxf6 18. exf6 Rg8 19. Rad1 Qxf3 {Taking the advantage of the pinned position of the g2 Pawn, Dufrense grabbed the f3- Knight. But he unconsciously set his foot on the cunning trap laid by Anderssen. Instead, 19... Qh3 would have given more resistance.} 20. Rxe7+ Nxe7 21. Qxd7+ {This is the whole idea behind the Knight sacrifice on f3} Kxd7 22. Bf5+ {Double checks are dangerous the force the king to move.} Ke8 {22... Kc6 loses to 23. Bd7#.} 23. Bd7+ Kf8 24. Bxe7# {}
