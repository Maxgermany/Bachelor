1. c4 {Here I squeezed a win in 18 moves. My opponent played excellently up to move 15 where he missed my opportunity to trap his queen.} e5 2. e4 {2. e4 is heavily discouraged by opening books, I prepared quite deeply in this path though.} Nf6 3. Nc3 Bc5 {3. ...Bb4 was also common. From now until well after the 10th move is all book moves and shouldn't offer much knowledge.} 4. Nf3 d6 5. h3 O-O 6. Be2 Nc6 7. O-O Re8 8. a3 Bd7 9. b4 {9. b4? This loses the e4 pawn to Bd4, 10. Bb2 Bxc3 11. Bxc3 and Nxe4} Bd4 10. Bb2 Bxc3 11. Bxc3 Nxe4 12. Bb2 h6 13. d4 {Things aren't looking to well for White and 13. d4 is a desperate attempt to open up his cramped up base. } exd4 14. Nxd4 Nxd4 {14... Nxd4? Black should've played more aggressively instead of the passive knight-trade. I would be in trouble with Qg5 (If 15. Bc1 then Qg6)} 15. Qxd4 Qg5 {The queen came a bit too late.} 16. f4 Qg6 17. Bh5 {17. Bh5!} Qg3 {17. ...Qg3?? Best move was Qh7} 18. Rf3 {18. Rf3! and the queen is trapped. Black resigned}
