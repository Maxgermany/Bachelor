1. e4 {this is my second attempt in annotation, last one was full with mistakes! I thank all Gk members who encouraged me with theirs PMs. I hope you will enjoy this one similarly, himu} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 4. d4 g6 5. g3 {my thought was that if black fianchitos in the castled position I will force cancel the black colored bishops, and then storm the king side pawns and the kitchen sink on the black king. so to do that I want to hide my king to the queen side, which will surely be a subject of queen side attack ( and in particular queen rook manuaver by the black ) so to hinder the black queen rook and light colored bishop I appoint my white bishop in g2.} Bg7 6. Be3 {just to protect the d pawn and preparing for the bishop cancellation} c6 {the move is to appease my white bishop, but it will hamper the knight. though Nd2 will be good keeping in mind that sooner or later e5 will help black and knight would have acted as a good preparation for that.} 7. Bg2 {continue with the plan note that I am almost ready to castle!} e6 {this locks in both the light colored bishop and  the knight for a while.} 8. Nf3 {now I am almost sure that he is not going to the queen side with the king, so I just arrange my pieces , there is no hurry no attack is even in the horizon.} Ne7 9. Qd2 {clearing my intension that I want 0-0-0} Nf5 {my dark colored bishop is too powerful a weapon for the attack in the present game. though he is offering the defensive kings knight, but I prefer to keep the bishop.} 10. Bf4 Qb4 11. O-O-O {protecting the b2} O-O {I want the knight to move} 12. g4 Ne7 13. Bh6 Nd5 {note that this knight is there to dearrange my kings position, a defensive move will be 14.Nxd5 Qxd2 15. Bxd2 cxd5 this sequence will lead to a very constricted game for black with a lead in development for white. I did not find it exciting enough.} 14. Bxg7 {get the bishop out, alekhine once said that its good to have a plan even if it is a bad one. and once you have a plan continue with the plan even tought it seems to go wrong.} Kxg7 {here I can take the knight and keep my castled king safe but I dont want to waste time and exchange my queen.} 15. h4 Nxc3 16. bxc3 {readers please decide if this move can be awarded with !, I dont want to cancel the queen. since it is helping me to command the diagonal c1- h6 and have a great prospect ahead once the king rook or king knight file opens. } Qa3+ {? I would have expected Qa5 so that it can take the obvious defensive burden if necessary in the king side} 17. Kb1 {my king is safe ! may be not in a good old castle but in an open varanda.} e5 {an attept to get the bishop out, but its too dangerous since I will get a square for my knight form where it is almost impossible to lure that out. note : if 18. Nxe5 f6 ; 19. Nxg6 ... etc now the black king will be out in the open (soon the rook file will open ) where my white bishop  joins the pandemonium.} 18. Nxe5 Be6 {very strong square for the bishop but would have been better with some preparation since ...} 19. d5 {now if the bishops go out of the game probably will help black } cxd5 {this restricts all the black pieces to their native square since I can use my 1queen to discover an attack against the king} 20. Qd4 {note that the queen is attacked indirectly since it can be hit by the knight.} Nc6 {??} 21. Nxc6+ Kg8 22. Ne5 {Nb4 (though looks like an excellent defensive move ) will ask for a rook pawn invasion followed by attack through the open b file, and I dont want that. better to keep the kings mansion airy.} Rfd8 {this move was needed long back} 23. h5 {I continue with my plan, there must be something in what alekhine said} Rd6 {?? this would have been starting of a forced mating sequence but the  knight will stop that!} 24. Nc4 {dxc4 loses that rook anyway} Rb6+ {probably the best move here, offer that rook for a knight and an initiative in form of an open rook file} 25. Nxb6 axb6 {now here I can do h6, ignoring the series of checks,  26 Qxa2, kc1 27 Qa3  (or Qa1  will lose the queen for the mate threat ) but I choose (wrongly ) this line ... } 26. Bxd5 {protects the checks alright} Bxd5 27. Qxd5 Qxc3 28. Qd4 Qa5 29. Qb2 {now my queen is too powerful for attack  and defence, note that I have an open varanda for my king but it is extra fortified by two of the opponents pawns. :)} b5 {the rest is just a followup} 30. h6 {threat} f6 {I can take the pawn bu there will be a series of checks and I am sure I will loose my queen in that open field somewhere so instead ..} 31. Rd7 Qb6 32. f4 Qc6 33. Rhd1 {and he resignes. I thank namssehc111 for the wonderful game, and thank all of you for your time.hope you enjoyed the game, please PM me your comments , himu}
