1. e4 {this is the tournament game. Played many times by the tourney's players. just killed me with this opening.} c5 {my only move when playing black. for years. who knew ?} 2. f4 {Some wild gambit from a smoke shop.} d5 {here come black,challenging for the center.} 3. Nf3 {Everyone knows this is great - old opening move. Nf3} dxe4 {this game is almost over !!! } 4. Ng5 {worse case scenario here is white wins back pawn.} Nf6 {Ah well, here is man's instinct to support all things in danger. No doubt black feels white Knight is "out of position"  } 5. Bc4 {THIS could be it.   !!! target f7} Bg4 {CLANK. !!!  And there it is. Thanks to Freddy we all have a killer opening. Some credit is due  Gameknot DB. But even that leaves you on your own, and you have to go it alone} 6. Qxg4 {Oh yeah !!! this opening involves a Queen sacrafice EARLY !!! whew, well, all gambit s take corage. You MUST follow through on gambits, or dont play them. } Nxg4 {doh! Naturally the Queen is gone to the stalwart guardian Knight} 7. Bxf7+ {This is about a long ten move mate where black will be left with but one decision the rest of the way. I think i may have played this opening in the '40's. Variant of Ruy Lopez.} Kd7 {His nibs on the move. The object is to keep him rolling. !} 8. Be6+ {gonna see some checks !!} Kc7 9. Bxg4 {I take this Knight. It has proven to have many attributes and may very well be THE PLAY OF THE GAME !!! We could discuss this nove till the cows come home, just accept it as part of the gambit. Dont overlook it.} Qd6 {Black mad "natural" move. getting away from fork at f7.? } 10. Ne6+ {Alas !!The fork was not the goal in this gambit. !!! Combos galore abound. } Kb6 {black suspects nothing. Just feeling harassed. (we've all been there)} 11. Na3 {Here come the Judge, threatening new fork (N-c4)with new Knight. Black is facing an inconvenient truth. !!} Qc6 {No fork for this guy.but it is jail time now.} 12. Nc4+ {CHECK.} Ka6 13. Ne5 Qb6 14. Be2+ {Well here's that Bishop from the opening Q sac. scenario.. moooo!!} c4 {well yeah..... but there is no move.} 15. f5 {This is the mating move. Took a lot of thought for this old man. I am sure you kids saw it right away !!} Nc6 {no help for black.  white just keeps on with CHECK !!   Check the King, check the Queen.} 16. Nxc4 {rjacobs is a good player andd friend. I want to thank himfor the game, and Freddy  for the tourney.  Can you see the MATE?} Qb5 17. Nc7# {checkmate with two Knights , Freddy.. in 17 moves !!! Thanks to all tourney players}
