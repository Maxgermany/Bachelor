Rf4xf7 Rd2 25. Rf1f2 {? I am playing altogether too passively probably out of respect for my opponent. I should have been looking for more forcing moves. This is the third time I missed a better one because I was nervous of his plans. The obvious 25 e6! is much stronger here  25 e6! then if 25 .. Rxb2 26 e7 wins eg .. Re8 27 Rf8+ Kg7 28 R1f7+ 1-0  Passed pawns need to be pushed!} Rxf2 26. Rxf2 Rf8 27. Kg2 Rxf2+ 28. Kxf2 {at this point the start of the K+P ending, the computer has the game dead level. So where did things go wrong for me?} Kf7 29. Ke3 {? 29 Kg3 would have been better for me .. g5 30 Kxg4 Kg6 =} g5 {! this was the the right move, keeping my King out, which Id not seen coming. } 30. b4 Ke6 31. Ke4 h5 32. c5 h4 33. c6 g3 {? A mistake by Black (first one!). This only draws, 33 .. h3 is winning  33 .. h3! 34 c7 Kd7 35 c8=Q Kxc8 36 Ke3 g3 0-1  So how did I miss the draw after 33 .. g3?} 34. hxg3 h3 35. c7 {?? Losing  The correct move was 35 Kf3 with a draw  35 Kf3 g4+ 36 Kf2 a6 37 Kf1 Ke7 38 Kg1 Ke6 39 Kf1 etc  Its drawn because the Black King can't take either pawn. I should have seen this possibility - an important motif to remember. } Kd7 36. c8=Q+ Kxc8 37. Kf3 g4+ 38. Kf2 Kd7 {}
