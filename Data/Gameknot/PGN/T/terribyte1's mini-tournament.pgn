1. e4 {Since I really only know the Stonewall opening, I thought I'd try a king's pawn opening instead.  However, it really just turned into a backwards stonewall setup.} e5 2. d3 Nc6 3. Be3 Nf6 4. c4 Bb4+ 5. Nc3 {I was planning to develop the knight here anyway, and then to take the knight outpost at d5 after castling.} h6 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qd2 {Setting up the stonewall-style bishop sacrifice} d6 8. Bxh6 gxh6 9. Qxh6 Nh7 10. Be2 f5 11. O-O Rf6 12. Qh5 Be6 13. Nd5 {Finally taking the outpost as I had planned.} Bxd5 14. cxd5 {The c file looked prettier for my rooks, so I took with the c pawn.  I also liked being able to un-double my pawns if the e pawn was taken.} Qe8 15. Ng5 {A tactical "underdefence" error.} Qxh5 16. Bxh5 Nxg5 {So now I've lost my knight and sacrificed a bishop (for two pawns), and while black's kingside is demolished, the only troops I've got over there are a bishop.} 17. dxc6 {I thought black would enjoy doubled pawns more than I did.} bxc6 18. Rac1 c5 19. a3 Ba5 20. f4 {These are sort of desperation moves.} exf4 21. Rxf4 Bd2 {Like the "n00b" I am, I walked straight into the bishop fork.  Bad news.} 22. Rff1 Bxc1 23. Rxc1 fxe4 24. h4 Rh6 25. hxg5 Rxh5 {Agreeing to trade off pieces was probably not what I should have down, being a rook down.} 26. dxe4 Rxg5 27. Rf1 Rg4 28. Re1 Re8 {That's pretty much a lost position.  In conclusion, my two bad-but-not-fatal mistakes on moves 16 and 21 were both preventable tactical in errors, and while the strategic play wasn't atrocious, one cannot expect to tactically blunder twice and still win.}
