1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 {an unusual move at this stage. what is black afraid of?} 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. d3 Bb4 6. Bd2 d6 7. O-O a6 {black seems not to like the pinning of pieces. I think he wastes a lot of time.} 8. a3 Ba5 9. b4 Bb6 10. h3 O-O 11. Nh2 {wants f4? white has agreat space to move in. maybe Nd5 was better.} Nd4 12. Rb1 c6 13. Be3 Bd7 14. Bxd4 Bxd4 15.
