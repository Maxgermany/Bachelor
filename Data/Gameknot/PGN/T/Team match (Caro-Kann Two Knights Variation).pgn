[Opening "Caro-Kann (B11), two knights, 3...Bg4"]

1. e4 {My opinions about this move are pretty well known. I think this is the best move, for the novice: this move seizes space in the centre, opens up the light squared bishop's diagonal and the queen's diagonal.} c6 {! Ok giving this move an exclamation mark is a bit arrogant but I love this defence and I believe it is the best defence to e4. For those of you who haven't come across it before, it is the Caro Kann (B10.) "According to chessgames.com the stats are like this: Number of games in database: 2093 Years covered: 1883 to 2008 Overall record:    White wins 38.8%    Black wins 24.1%    Draws 37.1%"  Heres some background history on the caro-kann from everyman chess. "The caro-kann is named after the two european masters Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann. Off the two, Caro had the slightly more distinguished playing career having played in a number of strong tournaments around the year 1900. It is fair to say that if it wasn;t for there contribution to opening theory there names would have sunk without a trace within the annals of histopry. Individually they are totally forgettable but together they have achieved great fame. As raymond keene put it, Caro and Kann has become as inseperable as Tweedledee and Tweedledum  This opening is introduced by the moves 1. e4 c6 and has long been one of black's ,ajor defences to 1. e4. The idea behind 1...c6 is to simplysupport the advance 2...d5, now if white captures on d5 black will be able to recapturewith the pawn, maintaining an equal position in the centre. If plack had started 1...d5 then this would not have been posssibleand he would have to recapture with a piefe/ This (1...d5) is slightly less respectable Scandinavian Defence (otherwise known as the centre counter)  In chess there are two distinct approaches to playing the oepning with black. The first is to try and negate White's advantage of moving first through careful, no nonsence play. The second, more risky strategy is to counter-attack at once, concentrating more on one's own ideas rather than what white is doing. The Caro-Kann is, with the exception of one or two sidelines, belongs firmly to the first group. it is an  opening that should appeal tot hose who like a solid st} 2. Nc3 {This is the two knights variation, I have found this has been played a lot agianst me recently. I don't know why because it is certainly not a mainline or one that is deemed very strong. I have been doing quite well against it.   In the two knights variation of the caro-kann white will play Nf3 at some point in place of the usual d2-d4. 3.Nf3 isn't bad but it offers black a serious alternative to conceding the centre. } d5 {This is the thematic move in the caro kann which sets up the formation that is called the caro kann.} 3. Nf3 Bg4 {Another reasonable alternative here is 3... g6. I prefer the more common move I played here. } 4. h3 Bxf3 {White attacked my bishop very early because it is very risky for me to play 4... Bh5. This is because White has a very strong, agressive continuation that exploits the bishops absence from the queen side, this is  4... Bh5 5. exd5 cxd5 6. Bb5  Nc6 7. g4 Bg6 8. Ne5 Rc8 9. d4 e6 10 Qe2 and now:  a) 10... Bd6 was thought to equaliseuntil white showed in a couple of recent games that he has the advantage after 11. Nxg6 hxg6 12. Nxd5 Bb8 13. Nb4!  b) 10... Bb4 is the old line that has been the subject of many heated theoretical battles over the yearsm After 11. h4! White usually ends up winning the bishop on g6 for a few pawns and the current view is that he gets slightly the better of an endgame, I'm not sure about this but I don;t knwo much about t endagmes! What do you think?} 5. Qxf3 {Only a complete novice would cpture with the pawn here you'd think wouldn't you! Not so though, it was the ceertainly the view of the purist Russian soviet press when they savaged Mikhail tal for playing 5... gxf3in the third game of his match with Botvinnik in 1960. They virtually accused him of bringing the game into disrepute.Tal defended his decision on sychological grounds. The game ended in a draw but Tal won the match and became world champion silencing the critics in the end.  "charleshiggie  (1828) on 19-Feb-08: According to the Chess Opening Explorer database I use, they have five games on their database with 5. gxf3, four ended in draws and one with a win for black. A couple of famous games between Fischer and Petrosian from the 1959 candidates tournament reached the position after 5.Qxf3 and 5....Nf6 and a later d4 by black was played instead of 5....e6 in both cases, although on the database e6 is a much more commonly played move. One of the Fischer-Petrosian games ended in a draw and is annotated by Fischer in his book "My 60 Memorable Games" and the other ended in a win for Petrosian and is annotated by Edmar Mednis in his book "How to Beat Bobby Fischer". Both were exciting, long, hard-fought games and are worth looking up."} e6 {"charleshiggie  (1828) on 19-Feb-08: In the Fischer-Petrosian games, Bobby continued with 6. d3 and 7. g3, trying to turn it into a sort of King's Indian Reversed. He also tried 7. a3 against Larsen and drew in 92 moves. (Source Edmar Mednis)"  } 6. d4 {Another major option here is the more conservative 6. d3 which I don't think is very strong but is viable.} Nf6 {I think I may have made a little mistake here as a 7. e5 could of been quite dangerous for me, althought technically it gives me a good French Defence position with my bad bishop outside the pawn chain and exchanged off. Nothing to fear here really though.} 7. exd5 {I think this is a poor move and gives up the centre. The book move here is 7.Bd3 which is much stronger, the continuation is 7... dxe4 8. Nxe4 Nbd7 9. 0-0 Nxe4 10. Qxe4 Nf6 11.Qh4 Nd5 and play seems equal with white having a minute advantage because of the bishop pair.} cxd5 {I capture towards the centre because this is a well known maxim and it gives me more control over the centre because of an extra central pawn and half opens the c-file which proves useful later on in the game.} 8. Bb5+ { This is an ok move, it devleops a piece and will pin my knight on c6 or d7, but it is a weak pin which can easily be repelled. Therefore I think 8.Bd3 is better because it doesn't waste time attemting this futile at best pinning maneuvre.} Nc6 {This is better than playing 8... Nbd7 because it doesn't have the potential attack on the d4 pawn which a knight on c6 will have if the pin is removed.} 9. Bg5 {This is a standard move, Castling is now possible on both sides but I would recommend it be on the Kingside because althought the h3 chink in the pawn structure is weakening bnlacks potential minority attack on a queenside castled position aswell as the half open c file being a weakness for a queenside castled position.} Be7 {I complete the devlopment of all my minor pieces and will soon castle on the kingside.} 10. Bxc6+ { !? This move anticipates me castling king-side, removing the pin on the c6 knight and thereby attacking the d4 pawn. This is logical however unnecessary because the bishop pair is strong in open positions which this might become and this is not the best way of anticipating and reacting to the potential threat 10.Rd1 is much better and maybe then exchanging the bishop for that knight later if deemed necessary.} bxc6 {Obviously... This move half-opens up the b-file where I can attack the b2 pawn. I can now also play a ...c5  pawn counter-attack on the centre which is very common in the Caro-Kann.} 11. O-O-O {?! No, this is not good at all, castling on opposite sides leads a very sharp game with pawn storms on opposite flanks occur a lot. The side to get there attack in first normally wins. However I can't see white mounting a very swift pawn storm on my kingside castled position because of all the pieces blocking littleboo's pawns in.  I on the other hand have an un obstructed pawn on a7 which I can put into action quicky. Why Queen can also gain attacking positions very quickly on b6 or a5 immediately and my rooks when connected will make a powerful battery on the b-file. To conclude the best move here is 11. 0-0} O-O {! From what I explained earlier this is a good move! Perhaps i could of played 11... Rb8 first though.} 12. Rhe1 {?! Not sure what the point of this was. The e file aint opening anytime soon, Both rooks on a the central files can be good but not when all the play is going on on the wings and the centre is blocked and staying blocked! White should be trying to strike on the alternate flank to the castled king so moving a powerful piece from that flank is undesirable and shouldn't be done voluntarily. I would suggest something along the lines of 12. g4 Nd7 13. Bf4 is better.   Charleshiggie points out here that there is another plan of counter-attack for white.} Rb8 {This aims to attack the weakness of the half open b-file and the b2 pawn, possible by doubling up rooks on the b-file and maybe even putting the queen on it! } 13. Bf4 {This is a decent move, it tries to counte-ract my attacking plans on this file by trying to drive my rook off it.} Rb7 {I'm not going to abandon this attacking file that easily thoguh, littleboo wuill have to try harder than that. Not how I'm embarking on my attacking plans while white hasn't even begun the intitial plans for a kingside attack, far from it littleboo has taken a powerful piece (the rook that was on h1) from the flank that littleboo should be attacking.} 14. Kb1 {This is a necessary because my pieces are soon going to attack those queen-side pawns and if I break through them and get a rook or queen on the first or second rank, checkmate would most likely soon follow. Therefore this move defends the pawns and is a good defencive move eevn though whites cahnies of getting more than a draw seem quite low here  but for a major blunder on my part.} Qb6 {This goes for the juggular immediately and threatens mate on b2.} 15. b3 {This creates a weakness in the pawn structure but is better than it first seems as a potential Bishop retreat ie Bc1 could drive any attacking piece from a3 potentially. I don't think 15. Bc1 (which is the only other realistic option here) is as strong, because pieces serving pawns  is notoriously bad, pawns should serve pieces if the former happened it causes passivity which isn't good when being attacked, passive play can lead to zugzwang easily where there are no good moves, or positions where black can't form a counter attack which is a very good form of defence surprisingly.} Qa5 {Gaining control of that a3 square for my dark squared bishop which if exchanged via a Bc1 manoeuvre the queen can can take the bishops place forming a mating net around whites susceptible King.} 16. Be5 {Not sure what this move achieves, the optimum defensive move is 16. Ka1. This removes the potential defender for me because now littleboo can't play Bc1.} Rc8 {This is so i can recapture with my rook on c5 if pawns are exchanged after c5 and then there will be more pressure on that little horsey alone on c3.} 17. Qg3 {Oh so thats what white was thinking, luckily I'm not falling for a cheap mating trick like that interesting attemt though, worth a try anyway littleboo in a position like this.} c5 {This is a strong move trying to open another attacking line for my powerful pieces. I have annotated a game which gives a good example of where opening lines leads to attacking play here: "Don't neglect the centre especially against Morphy! Paul Morphy () vs. Dr. Samuel Lewis () http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl?gm=6788"} 18. dxc5 {Not really any other option, there are no ways to defend the pawn effectively.} Qxc5 {Now the pressure is building up on white. But 16. Be5 does look stronger now as it defends the knight.} 19. Ka1 {A bit late I think... not sure though, I can't see better move myself. What do you think? Charleshiggie left a comment and he thinks this move is a total waste of time. I agree with this, he suggests moving his rook to d3 then to f3 where black will have to defend carefully or could end up in trouble because of the pinnedg7 pawn, pinned ofcourse by littleboos queen on g3. This is what I call 'active defence', trying to find a solution to  a defencive problem by counter attacking. This can be effective, and can turn your opponents thoughts away from his own attack.} Ne8 {Oh no mate on g7 I thought instantly after I clicked the submit button! A sinking feeling in my stomach, I'd thrown it away! I was about to resign when I realised the knight defended the g7 pawn from e8. I guess the moral of that is check twice before resigning, it might not be as bad as you first think!} 20. Bd4 Qa5 {I keep the pressure on!} 21. Kb1 {? Better is 21. Re2. This move seems pointless and therefore bad, when under pressure like this you can;t afford moves that achieve anything.} Rbc7 {The pressure is getting near to breaking point on that poor little horseys back, will be able to manage the pressure.} 22. Rd3 {The noble rook defends his comrade who is under threat of attack.} Bf6 {When attacking a piece and it seems you cant attack it any more try exchanging a defender thereby winning the piece you were attacking in the first place like I'm trying to do here.} 23. Bxf6 {Another thing to point out is thatI'm now eliminating the chance of mate on g7 which I feared I had fallen for  4 moves a go, it took that off my mind.  } Nxf6 {Completing the exchange or trade if you prefer.} 24. Ree3 {Defending their comrade.} Ne4 25. Rxd5 {This is a defencive sac, which is definitely needed here , however all is lost.  Some comments so far:  "charleshiggie  (1828) on 15-Feb-08: I think 24...d4 wins as well"  "moppa (1778) on 20-Feb-08: 24...d4 25.Rxd4 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Rxc3 27.Qxc3 Qxc3 28.Rd8  Ne8 29.Rxe8# (Whoops) is something black has to take care of if he is to play 24...d4"} exd5 26. Nxe4 dxe4 27. c4 {This prevents the capture on c2. } Rd7 {This so I can double my rooks here and then go for the mate.} 28. Rc3 Rcd8 {Now my rooks are doubled I can go for mate by putting a queen on a3 and playing ..Rd1 leading to checkmate} 29. Rc1 Rd7d2 {Now I threaten mate on a2 and I think there is no way out now for littleboo's king. I announced here that it was checkmate in 6 via 30. Rc2 Rxc2 31. Kxc2 Qxa2  32. Kc1 Qe2 33. Qb8 Qd2  34. Kb1 Rxb8 35. b4 Rxb4  36. Ka1 Qb2# whcih I think is the longest possible variation. He resigned here.  Thanks for the game littleboo. This game is the first caro-kann game I have ever annotated, hopefully I've given you some good firsthand knowledge of the opening. In this game I encountered the ever increasing in popularity, the two Knights defence variation. It's not a very theoretical line and is usually used as a surprise weapon to avoid more densely over analysed variation.  Most of the moves played at the beginning of this game seemed decent but 7.exd5 giving up the centre seemed poor, givin up the bishop pair were a few mistakes but the cardinal would of been littleboo castling into my attack, this isn't always bad like in many sicilian variations castling on opposite sides is common and attacks on either flanks are normally seen after but littleboo couldn't muster a quick and effective attack on the kingside after castling queenside so therefore he should of castled kingside.   the main problem littleboo failed to address was when he was under pressure he failed to try and alleviate it with proper technique. He could of tried to use 'active defence' aka counter attacking to draw the attention away from ones king. Or he could of tried to solidify his position which was soon not possible,  leaving counter attacking the only option. However littleboo did not play actively, he tried to solidify his position when it was not possible which lead to passive play. Ofcourse I'm not saying the best form of defence is attack (or offence if your american!) but it is a viable option!  By the way I'd like to say thankyou for the comments by my  team captain charleshiggie who has left some useful ideas which I have added to the annotation. Thanks also for the kind comments from others who}
