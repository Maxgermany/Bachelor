1. e4 {I had never seen a game where this guy would have played anything else than 1.e4.} c5 {Now I start with my common reply against 1.e4.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {Im quite sure that my opponent was waiting for Najdorf as he knows that Im bad loser and if I lose in one of my favourite openings I try it until I win but this time I didnt go for Najdorf even that its one of my favourite openings.} g6 {I was finally ready to launch Dragon on official game as I had trained this opening very much and I was totally ready for Ã¡ny kind of challenge in this opening.} 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 {The Rauzer attack, white is ready for long castling and start the pawn storm on king side.} O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O {White lets black to start his counterplay on center, 9.Bc4 is more often used nowadays.} d5 {Im going for the most aggressive option by sacrificing my pawn.} 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Nxd5 {White is accepts my aggressive challenge.} cxd5 13. Qxd5 Qc7 {Now I have gained my compensation for lost pawn as I can attack whites queenside from open lines with support of my bishops.} 14. Qxa8 {14.Qc5 is normal response but 14.Qxa8 is really intresting as white changes his queen to rooks. This move might look odd but its totally okay.} Bf5 15. Qxf8+ Kxf8 16. Rd2 {Its not easy for white to defend and black has to be cautious too. This is intresting situation.} Qb8 {This move was played in game Smyslov-Gufeld 1960.} 17. b3 {My opponent plays really accurately and he has shown to me that he knows Dragon variation really well. Smyslov-Gufeld game continued 17.Bb5 h5 18.Rhd1 Bxb2  19.Kxb2 Qxb5  and black has better position.} h5 {My computer offered 17...e6 18.Bc4 Qe5 19.Bd4 but I think that 17...h5 is as good as 17...e6.} 18. h4 {Good move by white.} Kg8 {Best move from my view.} 19. Bc4 {My opponent plays good move again by putting my king on line and activating his bishop and rook.} Kh7 {I dont know where from my head I heard "19.Kh7, opponent will take take pawn and then you won" it was quite intresting that I had about 21min on my clock and I spent only 30s to make this move. My computer offered better option 19...Qe5 20.Bd4 Qa5 21.Bxg7 Kxg7 22.Re1 Qxa2 23.Kd1 Qa1  24.Ke2 and position is better for black.} 20. Bxf7 {Now my opponent made a mistake in time trouble, I dont know how I got this idea that my opponent will eat my pawn for sure, I was completely sure about it. 20.g4 hxg4 21.h5 would be the right way.} Qe5 {This is the only winning move on this situation.} 21. Bxg6+ Bxg6 22. Bd4 Qa5 23. Bxg7 {Not 23.a4 Bxd4 24.Rxd4 Qc3 25.Rc4 Qa1  26.Kd2 Qxh1} Kxg7 24. Re1 {White keeps playing accurately.} Qxa2 25. Rxe7+ Kf6 {Well, it really doesnt matter where I move my king as long as I do not move it to g8 or h8.} 26. Rde2 Bf5 27. g4 hxg4 28. fxg4 Bxg4 29. Re2e1 Bf5 {I still need to make accurate moves or this could end to draw.} 30. Re7e2 a5 31. Rf2 Qa1+ 32. Kd2 Qd4+ 33. Ke2 Kg6 34. Rg1+ Kh6 35. Rfg2 Bxc2 {White resign. It is hard to say are those rooks better or worse than queen on these kind of situations. This time my queen proved to be better. Our team went to victory as this game was last one so our team won match with result 3-2.}
