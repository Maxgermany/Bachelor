1. e4 {This is my second annotation ever so I apologize if there are any beginner's mistakes in my comments. Any constructive comments are highly welcome.  Standard opening.} e5 {My usual response. I like to keep it simple.} 2. Nf3 {Developing knight and attacking e5.} Nc6 {Developing and defending e5.} 3. Bb5 {Putting pressure on knight and indirectly on the e5 pawn.} d6 {Backup on e5. Knight is pinned} 4. d4 {Developing and attacking e5. Though my guess was it would move on to d5 to attack the knight which is pinned. So...} exd4 {Pawn exchange ahoy! My thinking was: "Stop the attack before it happens!!!" Oh yeah, sometimes I'm smart like that. :P} 5. Nxd4 {Logical move here. Ncxd4 can't occur because it is pinned by the LSB} Bd7 {Developing bishop and unpinning the knight} 6. a4 {Not sure why this move was made. Maybe a backup to the b5 bishop, though developing the other pieces or castling might have been a better option here.} Nxd4 {Hate them pesky knights...especially ones i don't control} 7. Qxd4 {Getting material back and developing the queen. Might've been too early for the queen with some pieces still at home but I guess this move was kinda forced to get the material back.} c6 {Developing (kinda) and pushing the bishop away from my territory. Black pawn pushing white bishop away from their territory (kinda opposite of how it is in real life in the US...sorry for being a little racist here...lol)} 8. Bc4 {Keeping bishop in a good spot} Nf6 {developing knight} 9. Bg5 {Developing bishop while pinning the knight} Be7 {Developing bishop and unpinning the knight as well as backing the knight} 10. e5 {Not sure. Perhaps hoping I'll move the knight.} Nd5 {Which I did (forgot why...lol). Anyway, knight is near mid in a more offensive position.} 11. Bxe7 {Bishop eat bishop (dog eat dog!)} Qxe7 {Queen eat bishop (i guess tiger eat dog??)...getting material back} 12. Bxd5 {Took out my powerfully positioned knight (pretty smart move imo)...although white loses an attacking piece as well which was well placed too} cxd5 {only way to get material back (though I don't like it at all...floating pawns are annoying as hell)} 13. O-O {Getting rook into action perhaps? I would've probably done Qd4xd5 first to get the pawn} Bc6 {At this point I kinda don't remember what strategy I was trying out (maybe I didn't even have one...lol...happens a lot to me)  I guess this was to back the d5 pawn} 14. exd6 {pawn exchange...} Qg5 {Which I didn't take for some reason. I guess i was hoping to mate by moving queen to c1 when chance arose? We'll see...} 15. Nc3 {Quite late but developing knight...rooks are connected} Kd7 {Removing king from the open file (or row or column...lol can't remember what it's called) and attacking the d6 pawn} 16. Qc5 {backup on the pawn} Rhe8 {attacking the open row} 17. Rad1 {attacking the d5 pawn} Re5 {Protecting the d5 pawn, and I think the plan was to double up the rooks in the e file} 18. Rfe1 {Stopping the doubling up of rooks} Rxe1+ {rook exchange} 19. Rxe1 {Power Overwhelming(ish)!!!} Re8 {Hoping white will either exchange rook or not see the impending doom...} 20. Re7+ {...but oh well, not everyone's as blind as me :P} Rxe7 {Getting material back and hoping white will miss the impending doom!!!} 21. f4 {meh...white's a lot smarter than I usually am...lol} Re1+ {Just trying to get as many of white's pawns as I can before I go for Queen exchange} 22. Kf2 {Only choice} Qxf4+ {Getting pawns while attacking} 23. Kxe1 {Getting material back} Qxh2 {Following through with my super-awesome "Get-as-many-pawns-as-possible" strategy} 24. Nb5 {Placing knight in an attacking position. Though, I wasn't sure how it actually helped white at this point. Maybe attacking the a pawn?...} a6 {...which can be easily saved} 25. Na7 {attacking the bishop, but this move places the knight against a wall which is a serious mistake...knights against a wall are rarely good} Qxg2 {Oh yea, my super-awesome strategy was on full force} 26. b4 {putting pressure on the side where all of white's pieces are} Qg3+ {Now that the 3 pawns on f, g and h are passed I go for Queen exchange} 27. Kd1 {Not much white can do} Qxd6 {I kinda feel bad for the pawn now but this is a tiger-eat-dog world :P} 28. Qxd6+ {Not much white can do at this point} Kxd6 {Strategy complete...at this point I was hoping white would resign seeing how the board looks...} 29. b5 {Bring it on! Chicken-eat-potatoes  Trying to move the knight away from the wall might've been a better option, although that's a pretty useless move at this point too} Bd7 {pinning the knight to the wall} 30. bxa6 bxa6 {pin complete...now I go back to my pawns} 31. a5 {From this point on it was just a matter of time before white resigned or I promoted my pawns} Ke5 {Giving royal support to the peasants} 32. Kd2 {Trying royal intervention} Ke4 {Stopping white's royal advance} 33. c3 {I might've done the same...because president Obama said "Yes, we can!"} h5 {Run Rudolph run} 34. Ke2 {Santa's coming to town} g5 {Run Albert run} 35. Kf2 {Santa's still coming to town} h4 {Run Rudolph run} 36. Kg2 {Santa's almost in town} g4 37. Kf2 f5 38. Kg2 f4 39. Kf2 h3 40. Kg1 g3 {At this point white resigned. White cannot prevent the promotion(s) and ultimate checkmate.  I'd like to thank bigfoot57 for the wonderful game. Every game is a learning experience.  I'm sure I've made blunders that I still don't know about so I'd appreciate it if someone comments and lets me know how I could've avoided those mistakes.  Thanks for reading! Cheers!!}
