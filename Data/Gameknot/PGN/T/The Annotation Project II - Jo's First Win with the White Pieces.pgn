1. f4 {Hi everyone!  I did manage a win with the white pieces yesterday against Graham who has recently been knocking on the door of 1400 - I back him to get there sometime soon.  In this game I somehow managed to firstly over-turn the deficit by getting rid of the Wicked Witch of the West sometime in the middle-game and then winning a pawn immediately afterwards.  Graham then left a knight en prise and sadly it was downhill all the way for him as I managed to rid him of all his pieces bar his rook.  His refusal to give up the rook led to him eventually copping Old Matey.  How did this happen, well, we pick up the action on move 9.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 Qe8 {9. ....... Qe8 - Hmm, I played this against Master Freddy and came to grief so after that I decided to play either e5 or e6 here.} 10. Ne6 {10. Ne6 - so far the game has followed the easy19 v jstevens1 match which was annotated by Coach Ion.  My opponent deviates with the developing move Nd7.  Hmm, now why did I not think of that?} Nd7 11. Nc3 {11. Nc3 - development and hitting out at e5 pawn.} a5 12. Nxe4 {12. Nxe4 - narrowing the deficit by 2 points.} b5 13. Bf3 {13. Bf3 - threatening Nf6+ netting the Witch on e8.} Kb6 {13. ..... Kb6 - and Graham tucks his king away.} 14. d4 {14. d4 - In both Annotation Projects Pts 1 and 2 it has proven essential for white to get this pawn move in.  Here it frees up Fou Lenoir to come out to e3.} h5 15. Be3 a4 16. d5+ {16. d5+ - a king hunt now begins.  Although this does not result in checkmate you could say it was successful because I did win material as a result of it.} Ka5 17. b4+ {17. b4+ - a pawn sac to lure the black king into my camp.} Kxb4 18. Bd2+ Kc4 {18. ....... Kc4 - he finds the only move to ensure long-term survival.  No mate here so I must turn to Plan B which is win material.} 19. Be2+ {19. Be2+ - I now set up some conditional moves, at the end I will be a pawn up.} Kxd5 20. Nxc7+ {20. Nc7+ - fork.} Kxe4 21. Nxe8 Rxe8 22. Bxb5 {22. Bxb5 - I now win the b5 pawn and pin his knight.  Graham attacks my c2 pawn trying for a counter-attack in my camp but overlooks the fact that he has left his knight en prise.} Rc8 23. Bxd7 Rxc2 24. Bxa4 {24. Bxa4 - cleans up black's queenside pawns and attacks the rook on c2.  Graham retreats his rook to c8.  Note if he tries to keep his rook on my second rank with Rb2?? then Bc3 forks the b2 rook and the h8 rook.} Rc8 25. O-O e5 26. Rfe1+ {26. Rfe1+ - after finally castling on move 25 I now keep up the pressure with a check on the enemy king.  I soon find a way to trade off more material.} Kd3 27. Rad1 Bc5+ 28. Be3+ {28. Be3+ - a cross check.} Kc3 29. Bxc5 Rxc5 {29. ...... Rxc5 - firstly the bishops are traded off.} 30. Rdc1+ Kb4 31. Rxc5 Kxc5 {31. ....... Kxc5 - now one pair of rooks is traded off and I now pick off the e5 pawn with my rook increasing the pressure on black still further.} 32. Rxe5+ Kb4 33. Bb3 {33. Bb3 - knitting together my bishop and my a2 passer.} Rc8 34. Kf2 {34. Kf2 - time for Henry to come into the action.  I know I now have +5 in material points but I must convert this to victory.  I have found out that Graham does like to play his games out to mate so it will certainly be the much recommended practice I need to finish off such opponents.} Rd8 35. Rg5 {35. Rg5 - this has echoes of my game with Bert (the one where I was the exchange up and managed to win it).  My opponent protects his pawn with Rd6 but Fou Leblanc can pile up on it and win it.} Rd6 36. Bf7 Ka3 37. Rxg6 Rd2+ {37. ...... Rd2+ - Graham does not trade rooks but Henry can safely evade the checks.} 38. Ke3 Rd8 39. Ra6+ {39. Ra6+ - the rook protects my passer on a2 and gives me a tempo to get rid of Graham's h5 pawn.} Kb2 40. Bxh5 Rh8 41. g4 {41. g4 - I start to run my kingside passers up the board now.  This move protects Fou Leblanc and this now paves the way for my f pawn to head for Glendadom.} Rc8 42. f5 Rc3+ 43. Kf4 Rc4+ 44. Kg5 {44. Kg5 - Graham has given me a series of spite checks but Henry has now managed to evade them.} Rc7 45. f6 Rc5+ 46. Kg6 {46. Kg6 - closer and closer.} Rc8 47. f7 Ka1 48. Kg7 {48. Kg7 - Graham is playing for a stalemate, I must take care.} Rd8 49. f8=Q {49. f8/Q - checking to make sure that Graham's king will be able to move should he decide to give up his rook I now crown my f pawn.} Rb8 50. Qf6+ {50. Qf6+ - if Qxb8?? then it is stalemate!  Qf6+ stops the nonsense.} Kb1 51. Rb6+ {51. Rb6+ - the rook trade is now forced but Graham takes off my a2 pawn.  I now notice that Qb2 is mate so I duly deliver it.  This is now my third victory of the tournament and I now have 3.5 points out of 6 games.} Kxa2 52. Qb2# {}
