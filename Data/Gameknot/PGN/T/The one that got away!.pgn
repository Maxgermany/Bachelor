1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 {We pick up this epic game by Stalhandske at move 5 in the mini tournament. IMO the Sicilian Marocozy bind system starts slightly in white's favor. This is due to the edge in space and slightly more active knight. } Bg7 {logically developing the bishop to the strong diagonal. } 6. Be3 {developing and defending d4} Qb6 {adding pressure to d4 and hitting at the abandoned b2. Black has many alternative options here such as ...d6 and ...Nf6. } 7. Nb3 Qd8 {During the game I was reluctant to play ...Qc7+ because after 8. Qd2 Nf6 9. Nc3 d6 10. f3 the situation is almost ideal for white. However, 7. ...Qb4+!? 8. Bd2 Qb6 9. Nc3 Nf6 black should have no difficulties. } 8. Qc2 {?! slightly inaccurate as the queen to me looks awkward and passive on this square. Furthermore, it takes a key defender away from d4. Better in my opinion is 8. Qd2 d6 9. Nc3 Nf6 10. f3. } d6 {securing more control over the dark squares and releasing the LSB for active duty. } 9. Nc3 {White continues to develop and increase his control over d5 and light squares} Nf6 {Developing the knight, countering white's pressure on d5 and creating typical Sicilian threats of ...Ng4 and ...Nh5. } 10. h3 {preventing any business of black harassing the DSB with ...Ng4} b6 {At the moment white's e and c pawns are targets so the idea is to play Bb7 in combination of ...Nc5 to hit at e4. However, whie can simply play f3 and any hope of pressure on e4 ends. Looking back at it now it seems that the c-pawn is much weaker as the knight on b3 blocks white from playing b3. Which means white has to defend with pieces. So may a better alternative is 10. ...Be6 11. Be2 Rc8 12. 0-0 0-0 13. Rac1 Nb4 14. Qd1 Bxc4 15. Bxc4 Rxc4 and white's big pawn center is no more!} 11. Rd1 {Nice file for the rook and again making sure white does not lose control of d5 or d4. } Nd7 {following though with my plan to attack the e-pawn } 12. Be2 Bb7 {Pressure on e4 is mounting. I also like the position of my knight as they are very flexible and can easily if needed jump to c5 and e5} 13. O-O {The advantage of castling is that the rook on f1 supports f2-f4 which is very common attacking move in the Sicilian } O-O 14. f4 {Stalhandske signals his intent to go for a quick win. Stalhandske also rightly assesses that the pressure on e4 is false. } Rc8 15. Qd2 Nc5 {Hoping for 16. Nxc5 dxc5 with equality. } 16. Nd4 {But Stal does not bite. It wise to avoid equal exchanges unless absolutely forced too. The reason is because exchanges usually benefit the one with the lest amount of space. With the knight on d4 white creates possible threats of f4-f5. } Qc7 {?! not the best move as f5 looks strong for white in the long term. I really dont know what I was thinking to be honest but best was 16. ...Nxd4 17. Bxd4 Bxd4+ 18. Qxd4 e5 19. fxe5 dxe5 20. Qxe5 Qe8 21. Qxe8 Rcxe8 is likely a draw. } 17. f5 Ne5 {! only move that neutralizes whites growing advantage. Besides don't the Knight look awesome!} 18. Qc2 Ncd7 {discovery attack on c4. } 19. b3 {defending c4. However, now the dark square diagonal is weak. } a6 {preventing Nb5 and renewing the threat on c4. } 20. a4 {preventing ...b5. } Rfe8 21. Nd5 {Logical move that centralizes the knight and attacks the queen. } Qb8 {only move. } 22. Qd2 {Wow Stal is one tough nut to crack. } e6 {?! giving the knight the boot but creating some serious weaknesses on the kingside. Probably better is 22...Nc5 attacking e4 and b3 } 23. Nc3 Qc7 {?! kinda redundant and passive. Best is 23...Qa8!? But I missed white next move} 24. Bh6 Bf6 {White seems to be slowly but surely be getting better. I tip my cap to Stalh as it rare that I get out played like this!} 25. Rf4 {I really thought that 25. Nc2 opening a discover attack on d6 would be very difficult for black to handle. } Qd8 26. Rf2 Qe7 27. Rdf1 exf5 {really risky move. This wasme trying to push for something that is not there. Which again was out of character for me. } 28. exf5 Bh4 {?? wow I thought I had a draw at least after 29. Rf4 Bg3 but I failed to see everything. Again I was trying to create winning opportunities. Best was 28...g5} 29. Rf2f4 Bg3 30. f6 {Can you believe that I missed this move!} Qd8 {Stalh has me on the hook now all he has to do is give it a good tug!} 31. Bg7 {?? and the line snaps and the big gets away! Killer move was 31. Re4!! Bxe4 32. Nxe4 Nxc4 33. Bxc4 and it is over. } Rc5 {Rook to the rescue!} 32. Rf4f5 {?! Trying to save the rook but best is 32. Nc2 Bxf4 33. Qxf4} Nc6 {equal exchanges when defending is good!} 33. Rxc5 dxc5 {Also aiming for mirroring pawn structures increase your chances of a draw. } 34. Nf5 {White does not have enough wood to finish the job!} Nxf6 35. Qxd8 Nxd8 36. Bxf6 gxf5 37. Rxf5 Re3 38. Nd5 Rxe2 39. Rg5+ Kf8 40. Rxg3 Ne6 {the rest is academic. } 41. Nxb6 Rd2 42. a5 Bc6 43. h4 Be4 44. Kf1 h5 45. Re3 Bxg2+ 46. Ke1 Ra2 47. Nd7+ Ke8 48. Nxc5 Rxa5 49. Nxe6 fxe6 50. Rxe6+ Kf7 51. Bc3 Kxe6 52. Bxa5 Bf3 53. Kd2 Bg4 54. Ke3 {Wow a very well played game by Stalh. This is one he should have won!}
