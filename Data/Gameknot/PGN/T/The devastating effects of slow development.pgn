1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. e4 {Standard book opening so far.  Here begins my assault on the centre.  The advancement of the pawn on the King's file frees the dark bishop's development, and threatens to undermine Black's centre play.  Black cannot afford to allow the pawn to progress to e6; with a knight at d7 this square is a definite option to clear the knight away from the bishop's path, so will have to exchange his own pawn at d5 during the skirmish.  I was anticipating pe5 as a counter attack, although with my dark bishop free to pin the knight at f6 calculated this to be manageable.} dxe4 {This move only assists white.  The following exchanges give white the advantage in development, while black is forced to exchange his (developed) dark bishop for white's undeveloped bishop.  Moreover, white is left with a better centre, with pawns at c4 and d4 in comparison to black's at c6 and e6.} 8. Nxe4 Bb4+ 9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Qxd2 {White now has both knights, the light bishop and queen well developed.  White can now focus on bringing his rooks into play, while for black, the knight at d7 is unhelpful and the bishop is yet to get into the game.  For black, the bishop, and the QRook never get into the game.  From white's point of view, black is now playing with two fewer pieces, and white's superior forces begin to tell.  } O-O 11. O-O Nxe4 12. Bxe4 c5 {This is not a good move.  White's bishop is in the dead centre of the board, attacking all sides, while black's sits at home.  In a better move, black could regain some tempo in development with ktf6 which would, in addition, supply the knight to contest for control in the centre of the board, and help defend the king.  As it stands, however, black's king's side is undefended, while white has bishop, knight and queen all poised to attack black's king, with space in which the rooks can develop.  After move 12, black is in trouble.} 13. Bxh7+ {The lunge to black's throat: sacrifice of the bishop.  This move was considered purely on the state of the board, without an enormous amount of permutational analysis.  If delayed, black would have the opportunity to reinforce h7 with ktf6, and the board just "looks" in favour of a white attack.  } Kxh7 14. dxc5 {This is a slow move, but necessary to free up space in the centre for white.  } Nxc5 15. Qe3 Nd7 16. Rad1 Qf6 17. Rd2 Nb6 {Finally, on move 17, black has moved the knight and now has a possibility of getting the bishop into the game.  } 18. Ne5 {Unfortunately for black, white already has control of the d-file, and to a large degree the e-file, meaning the attack on the pawn at c4 is easily defended by kte5, which has the added bonus for white of restricting black's bishop on the c8-h3 diagonal.  Furthermore, white is now beginning to amass forces against black's king once more.} Na4 {Presumably an attempt to follow up with 19...pc6 20...bc7.  Too little, too late, unfortunately.} 19. Re1 Qe7 20. Qh3+ {White begins the march on black's king...} Kg8 21. Rd4 g6 22. Rh4 Qf6 23. Ng4 Qxb2 24. Ne5 {Black recaptures a pawn, presumably a forlorn attempt to maintain material gain.  Black has now, though, blocked off the queen from the dark diagonal and white is free to operate on the h file at will.  } Kg7 25. Rh7+ Kf6 26. Qf3+ Ke7 {Note that white still has yet to regain the material lost in the sacrifice of the bishop earlier.  Nonetheless, white's victory is all but assured...} 27. Nxg6+ Kd6 28. Nxf8 {Black resigns, with bishop and rook unmoved during the entire game.  Even without the aid of the sacrificed bishop, white still controlled the play.}
