[Opening "English (A11), Caro-Kann defensive system"]

1. c4 {I start out with the English opening} c6 {? an unusual response from Black (or at least, the first time Black played this against me) The most obvious drawback is that knight can't reach the c6 square} 2. g3 {working towards fianchetto-ing that bishop...} d5 {This justifies Black's last move to some extent - by the look of it Black wasn't too keen on bringing its queen out too early. It also allows the dark-square knight to move to d7.} 3. e3 {I defend the pawn with my bishop (maybe 3. d3 would have been better here)} Nf6 {simple development from Black} 4. Bg2 {? drops a pawn for White, though it could easily get the pawn back after dxc4} g6 {Black either overlooked the pawn capture or chose to ignore it and develop instead. Either way, it opens up a counterattacking option for White...} 5. Qa4 {?! White threatens to win at least a pawn. Neither of us noticed in the game, but Black could have stopped losing out on the exchange with Be6 (e.g 5...Be6 6.cxd5 Bxd5 7.Bxd5 Nxd5) Also, b5 seems logical here as well, attacking the queen, but of course loses a pawn (5...b5 6.cxb5 cxb5 7.Qxb5+) } Bg7 {? Black chooses to ignore the threat entirely...} 6. cxd5 {And White nabs a pawn. Because the c-pawn is pinned to the king by the queen, both Bxd5 and cxd5 are not an option here} O-O {Bd7 would have been the only move to stop another pawn loss, but since Black chose to ignore the threat again...} 7. dxc6 {why not?} bxc6 {Black chooses to exchange, whch isn't a good idea when you're down in points (though each side still has all of its pieces on the board - maybe it isn't so bad in that situation if you can use exchanges to get a better position) but then again, that c-pawn was dangerous there} 8. Bxc6 Nxc6 {a bishop-for-knight exchange} 9. Qxc6 Bd7 {Driving the White Queen away and preventing her from taking the rook} 10. Qa6 {one of three moves to stop Black from playing Bc6. The other two moves (Qf3 and Qg2) are dangerous because of Qc8 (or Rc8), and White would be forced to drop its bishop to stop Black's bishop from taking the rook (e.g 9.Qe2? Rc8! 10.f3 Rxc1+ with a check as the cherry on top of the cake!)} Nd5 {looking towards Nb4.} 11. Ne2 {This move gives the rook squares to escape to as well as opening up castling opportunities...} Bg4 {Which would be a bad idea right now! } 12. h3 {?! I'm not sure about this move anymore... it would probably have been better to move the knight away. This move forces Black to make a choice, and it wouldn't want to waste time retreating...} Nb4 {nice move! Threatens both a queen capture and a Royal Fork with king and rook} 13. Qc4 {again, this move with the queen is forced - Black hasn't given her the option of retreating to a safe square} Bxe2 {Black now has to make a decision - either capture the bishop with the king or capture the knight with the queen (capturing the bishop with the queen isn't an option because of Nc2+)} 14. Qxb4 {after a bit of thinking, I decided on taking the knight - I wanted to leave an opportunity for castling} Rb8 {A threat on the queen} 15. Qe4 {I chose this square to leave an escape route to White's kingside. The biggest problem here is that White is horribly undeveloped, and needs to catch up fast!} Bd3 {another threat on the queen...} 16. Qf3 {and the queen escapes (Qg2 was a better square, as here the queen blocks the f-pawn). Black has no more (immediate) threats} Rc8 {threatens the bishop - White is now forced to move its knight (which is a good thing development-wise)} 17. Nc3 {The side square has almost always been a bad position for White's knight, so this move came without hesitation (though I have noticed that playing the knight to the a-file seems to be good in some 'Annotation Project' games). But then again...} Bxc3 {With White's backward development, this would actually be beneficial for Black. It also stops my plan to exchange queens with Qd5 (I know I just said exchanges may be good for Black but after the exchange, my knight becomes a bit of a thorn in Black's side)} 18. bxc3 {so that the b-file could be open for White's rook, but this could have been a mistake that was left unpunished, as Black could seize control itself with Rb8} e5 {I don't know what Black's intentions were here} 19. Qb7 {?! White makes a threat that is easily averted - Ba3 would have been better} a5 {I was expecting Ra8 here, but the pawn still gets sufficient protection from the queen} 20. f4 {a challenge to the e-pawn, and with the hopes of bringing my rook to the f-file. I am now completely focused in achieving that goal} Bc4 {Black sees the danger, and protects f7 with his bishop.} 21. Rf1 {(??) damn damn damn! I moved way too quickly...} Bxf1 {and bearing in mind that I had three days to move...*sighs*} 22. Kxf1 {well, at the very least, the material is even} Qd3+ {that pesky bishop is now replaced by the queen} 23. Ke1 exf4 {exchanging pawns and breaking open my kingside defence} 24. gxf4 {obviously White wouldn't want to create a clear file right to his king} Qf5 {let me just take a little bit of time to say how I -bleep-ing hate it when this -bleep- happens! (pardon my French) Black's now going to slowly mop up White's pawns, one by one, until White's defence is destroyed. Black's pieces are in a much better position than White's, meaning that Black has a winning endgame here. (this has happened a lot in my games - my opponent gets his rook behind my pawns before I can do anything about it)} 25. Ba3 {'the best defence is a good offence' I needed to launch an attack of my own if I wanted to steal a win from this} Rfe8 {saving Black's rook, keeping it where the black bishop couldn't touch it} 26. Qb6 {bringing my queen back for the attack..} Qxh3 {and Black takes the pawn, as I expected} 27. Bd6 {I was fully aware of the face that Black was about to take my rook - but what could I do about it? if Ke2 or Kf2 the White queen would simply play Qh2+ and since White would not wish to move back to the first rank, it'd have to move to the third rank, which is bad no matter where it moves; 27. Kf2 Qh2+ 28.Kf3 Qxd2, forking the two pawns on the c-file. Alternatively; 27. Ke2 Qg2+ 28. Kd3 Red8+ 29.Bd6 Qd5+ and Black wins the bishop. The last alternative would be Bb2, and though I could then move the c3 pawn for my attack, Black would me more likely to make a move that destroys my attack. Though as for the bishop, Bc5 would have ended things quicker, actually... I'll explain later (although if you know what I pan to do, you'd already know why Bc5 was better)} Qh1+ {I expected this...} 28. Ke2 Qxa1 {and Black takes the rook and threatens to steal another pawn} 29. Be5 {I have to attack; I can't afford to defend} Qxa2 {as expected, again...} 30. Qf6 {and now all of a sudden White has a mating threat! If, at move 27, I had moved Bc5, it would now be at Bd4, then all Black would have is Kf8, then; 31.Qd6+ Kg8 32.Qf6 then Black would have been forced to accept a draw. Here, Black has another option....} Rxe5 {and although it's a Rook-for-Bishop exchange...} 31. fxe5 {Black still has very real threats on White, and White has nothing} Rxc3 {? Black takes a free pawn - White can't retake because the queen pins the d-pawn- but now I have an attack that gets me a draw} 32. Qd8+ {bingo!} Kg7 {forced..} 33. Qf6+ {check....} Kg8 {escapes ...} 34. Qd8+ {check...} Kg7 {escapes } 35. Qf6+ {check (I offer a draw here, but it's rejected for...)} Kh6 {Black tries a different escape route but...} 36. Qh4+ {check!} Kg7 {escapes....} 37. Qf6+ {I offer another draw, and this time, it's accepted :)}
