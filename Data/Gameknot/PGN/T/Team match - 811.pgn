[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {Public annotation for team benefit ...} Nf6 2. Bf4 e6 {Fairly unusual opening for me, but trying to turn it into a standard(ish) Queen's pawn game.} 3. Nf3 d5 4. e3 c5 5. c3 Nc6 {Now happily in my comfort zone, looking for a sensible way to develop further.} 6. a3 a6 {This is preventing Bb5, as I want to keep the knight for the e5 square.} 7. Nbd2 c4 {Slightly strange choice really, not sure why I played this.} 8. h3 Be7 9. g4 Bd6 {Slow move, was looking for the exchange to free up my pieces for the kingside defence.} 10. Be5 Nxe5 {Ridiculous blunder, this put me very badly on the back foot in the game} 11. dxe5 Bxe5 12. Nxe5 {behind on material, development and initiative now -- the game is beginning to look bleak} Qd6 13. Nef3 {f4 seemed more sensible to me, this seems a good time to press the kingside attack - now I am happy to castle and build pressure for a counter-attack} O-O 14. g5 Nd7 15. h4 g6 {This seems to give me enough strength to hold, still looking for some opportunity to counter-attack. White's pieces are fortunately not well co-ordinated at this stage.} 16. h5 {Definitely premature - capturing only strengthens my rook, and leaving alone does not seem to help white's position. Much better to look at getting the queen out and a queenside castle -- when white pawns can double up on the h file black is in serious trouble} b5 17. Qc2 Ne5 18. hxg6 {this gives me the possibility to start a counter-attack. Queenside castle would help greatly here.} Nxf3+ 19. Nxf3 fxg6 {Swapping the knights gives f3 knight some trouble when the file opens for my rook(s)} 20. Rh6 {Strange move - had a queenside castle already been done this would give much stronger attacking chances.} e5 {Really to defend the g6 pawn from a rook sac, as this seems to be seriously problematic for me.} 21. Nh4 Bf5 {ditto} 22. Qd2 Bg4 {opening the file for the rook whilst keeping the knight pinned in place - preparing for e4 to get the queen involved} 23. Bg2 {I totally overlooked this move, e4 now simply fails to Bxe4. Decided to use this as an opportunity to get my other rook involved.} Rad8 24. Qc2 {Again, this is odd - e4 was my long term plan, and now I can work with it. White seems to be gaining nothing from this attack.} e4 25. f3 Qg3+ {The counter-attack begins in earnest.} 26. Qf2 Qxf2+ 27. Kxf2 exf3 28. Bxf3 Bxf3 29. Nxf3 {Exchange of material leaves white still ahead on material, but with an awkward position - I need to be very careful of Ra-h1 though as it is very hard to defend against.} Rf5 30. Kg3 {Removes the pin} Re8 {Re1 seems the only defence here.} 31. Rah1 Rxe3 {Now the pin is harsh. Rf1 holds on to the knight but loses the g5 pawn for nothing. Rxh7 leaves a draw by repetition} 32. Rh6xh7 Rexf3+ {Kg2 or Kh2 leaves a draw by repetition now} 33. Kg4 {A final blunder by white, allowing a lucky escape for Black.  Good early development by white left black in a lot of trouble, and black had to struggle hard to get back into this game - was very lucky to get a win!} Rf5f4# {}
