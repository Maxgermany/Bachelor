[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 {Controlling the centre and giving my queen and LSB space to move.} e5 {Nothing new yet.} 2. Nf3 {As usual.} f6 {?! The Damiano Defence. This will allow me to mess up my opponent's position a lot. I prefer Nc3.} 3. Nxe5 {Here is the knight sacrifice. From this point onwards, Black is in dire straits.} fxe5 {He retakes, a bit surprised at my move.} 4. Qh5+ {Check. Here is a chance to win a pawn.} Ke7 {g6 allows me to get the rook, but this allows me to develop with tempo and wreck Black's position more.} 5. Qxe5+ {Black is forced to do Kf7.} Kf7 6. Bc4+ {Developing with tempo.} Kg6 {Another option was d5, but that gives away a pawn at best.} 7. Qf5+ {Black's king is once again forced, this time to h6.} Kh6 8. d4+ {Discovered check. Qg5 is mate in one, so best is g5.} g5 {The best move.} 9. Bxg5+ {Check. I don't think that this leads to a forced mate. However Qxg5 allows me to go on a killing spree, starting with Qxf8+. Is there a move here leading to forced mate?} Kh5 {Allowing a mate in one, either by g4# or Bf7#.} 10. Bf7# {Checkmate! Although we are equal in material points, we aren't in position. Black's king is stuck on the side of the board and no pieces have been developed. The moral: play the Damiano Defence with caution. Please give constructive and helpful comments.}
