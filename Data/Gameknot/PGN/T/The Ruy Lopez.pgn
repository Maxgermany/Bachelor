[Opening "Ruy Lopez (Spanish opening) (C60)"]

1. e4 {So the first move for the Ruy Lopez is e4 by white.} e5 {Followed by e5.} 2. Nf3 {Then the knight moves to f3.} Nc6 {And the black knight protects its pawn by moving to c6.} 3. Bb5 {Then the bishop moves to b5 creating the Ruy Lopez! This is one of my favourite openings and I have also participated in a Ruy Lopez mini tournament.}
