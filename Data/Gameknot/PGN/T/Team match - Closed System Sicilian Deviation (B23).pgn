[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed, 2...Nc6"]

1. e4 {The game starts with [1.e4], King's pawn opening - that indicates a game with fast found tactics.} c5 {My latest fashionable reply is [1.c5], a Sicilian - which creates an non symmetrical position where both sides have opportunities for attack and to try for an advantage.} 2. Nc3 {This leads to a closed Sicilian.} Nc6 {Continuing the mainline of the Closed Sicilian.} 3. Nf3 {The usual standard move [3.g3], is played with a modern styled bishop fight for the center. The standard line goes [1.e4 c5  2. Nc3 Nc6  3.g3 g6  4.Bg2 Bb7  5.d3 d6  6.f4 e5 (...e6, ...Nf6)]. My evaluation is that the text move fights for the center using an alternate approach. It does not appear to cause any major weaknesses for white and does develop in preparation for king-side castling. It differs from the main line in that it is not an aggressive approach to fighting for the center, which may afford black opportunities for gaining the initiative.} e6 {Playing into uncharted (for me) territory, I play in the style of a Paulsen pawn formation, which controls d5 preventing [Nc3-d5] while providing the f8 bishop some mobility. The plan is development for king-side castling. When faced with unusual openings I try to envision a similar opening formation and look for positional weakness and piece mobility considerations. This position affords white 2 ready knights, but neither can move forward because of preventative play by black. The flank pawn at c5 is ready exchange after [d2-d4].} 4. Bb5 {I was looking at this idea when [3.Nf3] was played. It presents a pseudo pin on the knight (because of the pawn at d7), and threatens to exchange [BxN]. But what is gained by such a move? Lets evaluate the position: the c6 knight is influencing the center by preventing [Nf3-e5], but it is not guarding any pieces, so an exchange by say [4...a6 5.Bxc6  bxc6] has the effect of strengthening the center for black by bringing the b7 pawn to c6 where it controls d5 and c5, which works against the c3 knight. The result is a half-open b file for the black rook, and a bishop advantage for black, and strong central control. This appears to offer black advantages in the center and quality of pieces and position. For this reason the move appears questionable (?!), and would require some proof of concept to see what it gains. The exchange does allow [Nf3-e5] where it influences (g6,f7,d7,c6) and does take some work to extricate by black with perhaps (...a6, ...Qc7, ...d6), and meanwhile there is an open diagonal for white [Qg4  Nf6], but castling must wait until the weakness of g7 is resolved (weak because the f8 bishop must develop before castling). } a6 {The bishop must be questioned because it presents uncomfortable leverage against the knight. The point of this move was to instigate an exchange, with the secondary idea of chasing the bishop to a position where it is constricting the position for white [Bb5-e2].} 5. Bxc6 bxc6 6. d4 {White plays immediately in the center, changing the game from what typically would be a closed position to an open one. But of course this is not a typical closed Sicilian.} d5 {This move is made with the idea of making use of the c6 pawn in the event of [7.exd5 cxd5] which gains the center for black. The pawn at c5 is safe by the bishop and can also exchange later to take complete control of the center.} 7. e5 {The text move creates an uncomfortable positional pressure for black, but the pawn may find itself soon alone. An idea black hopes to use to advantage.} cxd4 8. Nxd4 {Or [8.Qxd4 ?!] was possible, but uncertain for advantage after [8...c5  9.Qg4].} f6 {Playing for positional development at the expense of a pawn. This was an unplanned sacrifice. You could call it a Homer sacrifice (Homer Simpson of course).} 9. Nxc6 {The knight attacks (e7,d8,b8,a7), but it is unsupported. The queen is at risk and must move to a square with the most influence while also counter-attacking the knight. There are 2 choices (c7,b6), where [...Qd8-b6] appears best due to the pressure at (b2,f2).} Qb6 10. exf6 {I was not expecting this move and it caught me off guard. The consequences of [10...Qxc6] is [11.f7  Kxf7  12.Qf3 ] and black finds an unpleasant situation after attacking play by white. The best move for black appears to be [...Nxf6] developing a piece while preparing [...0-0].} Nxf6 11. Ne5 {The text move appears the best choice because of [11.Nd4 Bc5] can go to [12.Nf3? Bxf2 ] or no better is [12.Be3 e5!  13.Nb3 Bxe3  24.fxe3 Qxe3 ]. The position calls for black to develop the f8 bishop with an attack.} Bd6 12. Bf4 {Now a fight for the knight occurs. Black gains nothing from [BxN BxB], and has no continued attacking developing moves that play for an advantage other than [...0-0].} O-O 13. Be3 {White plays tactically to save the knight.} Bc5 14. Na4 {The text move (?) is a nice forking attack, but it allows black to free both queen and knight from danger. Better was [14.Bxc5] for an equal trade and material edge.} Qa5+ {The text move (!) counter-attacks with a fork (check and QxN).} 15. Nc3 {The text move is one of a few other possible continuations, where [15.Qd7 Qxa4?  16.Bxc5] is not good, but [15.Qd7 Bb4  16.c3? Bd6!] with material gain, or [15.Bd7 Qxa4] material gain. The weakness is that black now has another tactic by [...d4!].} d4 {It almost appears that [16.Bxd4] backed by the queen should work, but it loses to: [16...Rd8!], protected by the queen, where the bishop is pinned, followed by [17...Bxd4]. The move [...Qd5] ensures that [Ne5-f3] can not be used to save the bishop.} 16. Nc6 {White tries to tactically resolve the situation. The only piece attacked by this move is the queen, and currently no checking move can be made next by the knight. The text move (?) has the flaw that black can add a second attack by [16...Qc7].} Qc7 17. Nxd4 {At first glance it appears that white has solved the problem, but black has another tactic ready.} Rd8 {The text move (!) assails white with another pin which is hard to resolve due to the available move [...e6-e5].} 18. Nce2 {White gives a try to saving the knight, but perhaps has overlooked the pawn move. The unfortunate aspect of the position for white is that neither knight can produce any quality counter-attacks, and the e3 bishop has nothing to add.} e5 19. c3 {With the idea of keeping the queen safe from the rook after the capture.} exd4 20. cxd4 {Now of course the pawn can not be taken because black does not have enough control of d4, and can not obtain more control using the queen. Even though white is down a piece, the compensation is in black pawns. Material is even in a point sense, but black has opportunities for attacking play, especially considering the uncastled king. The position could be considered to favor of black (-/=).} Bb4+ {Playing to gain an advantage. Responses considered: [21.Bd2 Bxd2  22.Qxd2 Ne4  23.Qc1 Qa5   24.Kf1 (24.Nc3?!  Rxd4) and black is a little better (-/=), or [21.Nc3 Bxc3  2.gxf3 Qxf3 ] with an uncertain, to slight edge for black (-/=).} 21. Nc3 {White chooses option 2.} Bxc3+ 22. bxc3 Qxc3+ 23. Kf1 {The text move (?) appears best, but it is not. If [23.Bd2 Qxd4  24.0-0 Qxd2] advantage black (-/ ), or [23.Bd2 (23...Qxd4?  24.Qb3  Rd5  25.Rd1)  Re8   24.Kf1 Qxd4  25.Qb3  Be6] with advantage to black (-/ ). But better is [23.Qb3  ! Qxb3  24.axb3] and the pressure is gone and black has a smaller advantage (-/=).} a5 {The text move (?) is made with the idea of clearance for [...Ba6 ]. But better is [23.Kh8] to avoid the queen exchange.} 24. Rc1 {Better is [24.Qb3  !].} Ba6+ {The idea is to push the king into a corner, making a back rank mate a consideration.} 25. Kg1 Qa3 {Attacking a weak point. If the pawn is taken, then the possibility of promoting the a5 pawn becomes more realized.} 26. Qb3+ {White refutes the attack, but now an exchange of queens favors black materially and positionally.} Qxb3 27. axb3 {The possibilities for promoting the a5 pawn are increasing.} Rac8 {Attacking the only mobile rook.} 28. h3 {The text move (?) prevents [...Nf6-g4], but does not consider the threat on the rook.} Rxc1+ 29. Bxc1 Rxd4 {The end result of the exchanges is that black has accrued a second point and now has plans for eliminating the b3 pawn with the idea of pawn promotion.} 30. Kh2 {Protecting the bishop.} Rd3 {The pawn can not be saved.} 31. Re1 {The text move seeks to provide the rook play. The move [Re1-e8 ] is prevented by the knight.} Rxb3 32. Re5 {White attacks the pawn directly with possibly having hopes of a forking attack by [32...a4  33.Ra5]. The problem for black is how to keep the pawn while refuting the attack.} a4 {The text move is perhaps better than other methods because it moves the pawn forward to a square that is safer, and it allows black to continue the pawn journey.  If [33.Ra5] then [33...Bb5!] resolves the problem for the moment. The next consideration will be how to enable the pawn to proceed. A good idea would be to bring the knight and king into the arena if possible. I had considered moving them both, but there is also the matter considering the success of the pawn promotion due to the possibility of white obtaining good counter-play queen-side while trying for pawn promotion also! Its a matter of effectiveness and time. } 33. g4 {White mobilizes the pawn majority.} Rb5 {Preventing the rook from becoming a problem at a5. Having a piece majority affords black the luxury of offering exchanges.} 34. Re6 {Counter-attacking play.} Bc8 {The text move (!) is a counter-attack by black which provides protection of the pawn by controlling a6.} 35. Rd6 {White seeks a forking attack (king and bishop) at d8.} Rb8 {The text move (!) prevents the success of the [36.Rd8 ] fork attack, while seeking to maneuver the rook to a position behind the pawn at a8.} 36. Rd4 {An ineffective attack. Better was to mobilize the pawn majority while keeping the bishop ready as a blockader at a3.} Ra8 37. Rd8+ {An attacking move, but it is not effective.} Kf7 {The king is now safe from further checks because the square color is opposite of the opponents bishop, and because d7 is controlled by the c8 bishop. Now black can consider plans for gaining control of a3 for the pawn by using the knight.} 38. f3 {Keeping the pawns on the same color as the opponents rook while preventing [38...Ne4]. Its not easy to recommend a better move, but maybe [38.Ba3], a square not quickly attacked by the knight.} Nd7 {The text move (!) mobilizes the knight to the other side of the board where it can be used to assist the pawn promotion plan. I rate the move highly because of the applied concept, and because of how it makes the rook appear completely helpless boxed in at d8. True that the rook condition is merely transitional, but it does highlight how badly placed pieces become ineffective and can be made more ineffective. The rook is only out of play on this move, but the opponent must find another piece to move or play an unwanted sacrifice exchange.} 39. Ba3 {The text move is made with the idea of blockading the a4 pawn. A move I had considered which prompted me to bring the knight into play.} Ne5 {There are 2 squares (d5,b6) which can be used to reach c4. The text move (!) attacks a pawn while gaining the target square. The move is give a strong rating because it uses an attack to force the opponent to protect the pawn, and this allows the knight to move with tempo while maneuvering to c4 where it removes the blockader of the pawn (by threat of exchange), allowing black to achieve goals while preventing white from achieving good counter-play.} 40. Kg3 Nc4 {Seeking to remove the blockader of the pawn.} 41. Bc5 {A move considered with the idea of influencing the a3 square. But black will achieve 3 more points in the event of [41...a3  42.Bxa3 Nxa3], but this would be the only chance of postponing the inevitable by white. I do not see a better move - white seeks to maintain 2 pieces.} a3 {Continuing with the plan.} 42. f4 {Mobilizing the pawn majority, but it is too slow.} a2 {Now there is an eminent threat of pawn promotion that white must play against.} 43. Bd4 {The text move offers the idea of a bishop sacrifice to prevent the pawn promotion. To succeed with the plan black needs to prevent the sacrifice.} Rb8 {The text move (!) begins the setup of a counter-plan to prevent the bishop sacrifice. The move is rated strongly due to the concept applied. The idea is [44...Nb2], but white can play against the plan with [44.Ba1! Rb1!  45.Rxc8 Rxa1  46.Ra8 Nb6! {followed by ...Nd5, ...Nc3}  47.Ra3 {the only try} Nd5  48.Kf3 Nc3!  49.Rxc3 Rb1  50.Rc7  Ke6  51.Rc6  Kd5] and the pawn will promote. White can sacrifice the rook for the pawn, but black should have no problem winning afterwards.} 44. g5 {White places all hope in the pawn storm, but it is too slow.} Nb2 {Blocking the bishop to make a1 safe for the pawn. The counter-play [45.Bxb2 Rxb2!  46.Rxc8 a1Q] and black is winning.} 45. Bxb2 Rxb2 46. f5 a1=Q 47. Rxc8 Qa3+ {Now black begins a king hunt where the king is maneuvered to the edge of the board for mate. The next moves are forced and blocking does not help.} 48. Kf4 Rb4+ 49. Ke5 Qa5+ 50. Kd6 Rd4+ {The text move is better than [50...Rb6] due to [51.Rc6] blocking the check.} 51. Kc6 Qc3+ {Switching from a linear progression of checks pushing the king towards the 8th rank, to pushing towards the a file where a linear mate will occur.} 52. Kb7 Rb4+ 53. Ka6 Qa3# {This was a fun game that I was fortunate to have end in my favor. I thank my opponent for the complications and for a great game.}
