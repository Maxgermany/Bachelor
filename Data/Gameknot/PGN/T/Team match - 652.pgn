1. d4 {A team game I finished very recently, 7 days per move. Very exciting game.} d5 2. Nf3 {I have recently become addicted to Greek Gift sacrifices, and this seems to be the best way of trying to reach them. Does anyone have any suggestions to help?} e6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bd3 Be7 5. O-O O-O {Developing in traditional fashion. Notice that my light-squared bishop is aiming at Black's kingside.} 6. c4 c6 7. Nc3 h6 {Hmph!!!! That foils my cunning sacrificial idea. Never mind: a slightly less orthodox sacrifice in this position would be Bxh6, which offers up some interesting ideas.} 8. e4 {Opening up the attack line from my dark-squared bishop to the pawn on h6.} dxc4 9. Bxc4 Bb4 10. Be3 Bxc3 11. bxc3 Nxe4 {Oops, I hadn't noticed that pawn loss. But then, what do pawns matter when I'm about to uncork a stunning sacrifice?} 12. Qc1 {Nearly ready...} Nd7 13. Bd3 {Another piece moves into position, with tempo.} Ndf6 14. Bxh6 {SMASH! The nutcracker.} Qd5 {!?!?!?! My first impulse was: that's NOT FAIR! The creative part of me considers it shockingly bad form to decline such a brilliant sacrifice which the other player has put so much thought into. This made me really annoyed. Granted, I win a pawn...but that's all.} 15. Bf4 {Fine. Back again.} Qh5 16. Qe3 Qf5 17. Nh4 Qh7 18. Bg5 {I think this wins a piece. Black's defending pieces are all overworked.} g6 {That's one of the ways I win a knight. Obviously the central one is the one I go for: the other is defended.} 19. Bxe4 Nxe4 20. Qxe4 f6 21. Qxg6+ Qxg6 22. Nxg6 fxg5 23. Nxf8 Kxf8 {It is beyond me why Black is allowing White to go on an exchanging spree. It is usually taken for granted that generally the side that is ahead on material benefits from exchanges.} 24. Rfe1 {Time to bring the rooks out. Black's bishop is bad, which gives me a little more time.} Bd7 25. Rad1 Kf7 26. Re3 a6 {Why? No idea. Surely Black would benefit much more by making one of his two poorly placed pieces more active?} 27. Rf3+ Kg6 28. Rdd3 Re8 29. Rfg3 Rf8 30. h4 Rf5 31. Rxg5+ Rxg5 32. hxg5 Kxg5 {More exchanges.} 33. Rg3+ Kf6 34. Kh2 b5 35. Rf3+ Ke7 36. g4 Be8 37. Kh3 Bg6 38. Kh4 a5 39. a3 Be4 40. Rf4 Bh7 41. g5 {I think most viewers will see my cunning plan. White has placed every single piece and pawn on the DARK squares!!! This makes Black's bishop useless! This tends to be a very useful weapon to have in the arsenal for bishop endgames.} Bf5 42. Kh5 Kf7 43. Kh6 {Back on the dark squares.} Kg8 44. Rxf5 {I think this works. White's pawn can pull through without the added complications of the rook and bishop. An example of Simplifying in a winning position.} exf5 45. f4 Kh8 46. g6 Kg8 47. g7 b4 {I just need to be careful NOT to take all the pawns on offer, otherwise Black will be stalemated! With care, White still has a clear win.} 48. axb4 a4 49. d5 cxd5 50. b5 a3 51. b6 a2 52. b7 {Black wins the queen race, but White wins the game as he queens WITH CHECK.} a1=Q 53. b8=Q+ Kf7 54. g8=Q+ {The power of queening with check: White has the extra tempo needed to create another queen...also with check!} Ke7 55. Qge8+ Kf6 56. Qd6# {Forced. Good game. What do viewers think?}
