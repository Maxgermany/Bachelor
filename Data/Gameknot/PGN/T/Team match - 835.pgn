[Opening "Reti opening (A05)"]

1. Nf3 {This was a team match. When we started I was actually higher ranked than slebecnyer. By the time we finished the game, slebecnyer had won 23 in a row (including an earlier game against me while playing black). He had reached a ranking of 1923 and it was clear I was over matched.  I don't play much against this opening so he caught me by surprise right off the bat. I proceeded with caution. I am black....} Nf6 2. d4 d5 3. e3 c5 4. Nbd2 Nc6 5. c3 {So far following the moves available at the chess database.} e6 6. dxc5 {At this point the game leaves the games available at the chess database. Our opening game becomes "unusual" (statistically speaking) by the 6th move.} Bxc5 {Clearing my King side for castling and position the Bishop quite aggressively. The bishop is vulnerable to b4 attack, however, slebecnyer doesn't seem to be concerned with the bishop .... at least not yet.} 7. Bb5 {He is clearing his King side.} Bd7 {I continue to develop.} 8. O-O O-O 9. Nb3 {Positions the Knight, and moves forward opening his dark Bishop (it was getting stuck there with the Knight on d2). So really a developmental move, while also attacking the vulnerable Bishop on c5.} Bd6 {Chose to retreat. Perhaps 9... Qe7 would have done more for me, however, I did not exploit that move much... or enough.} 10. Bd2 {I noticed that higher ranked players tend to work toward strong development and develop as many strong pieces as possible before launching the attack.  slebecnyer seemed to follow the same pattern.} e5 {In a way this "felt" like a weak move, almost a loss of tempo. However, I needed to open a lane for my light Bishop, at the same time I am threating with e4, opening my dark bishop lane as well. At that point I'd have a lot of artillery pointed in the direction of his King.} 11. c4 {That was a concerning move cause the following c5 would be awkward for me to deal with. But I decide to attack as well. I felt well developed and ready to attack.} a6 12. c5 axb5 13. cxd6 {I liked this exchange, cause the pawn on d3 is now stranded and it is just a matter of time when it will fall. Meanwhile, I opened my a-file for the Rook. This doesn't seem that relevant now, but it will become very relevant later. From this point on I am actually looking to take advantage of this a-file opening.} Bg4 {Attacking the pawn on d3 and pinning the Knight.} 14. h3 {Up to this point it's pretty even with possibly my slight advantage over the trapped pawn on d3.. However here the course of the match takes a turn with my aggressive:} Bxh3 15. gxh3 {I am starting to like this sacrifice more and more. It has brought me a lot of success in the past. Similarly, I have struggled to defend against this sacrifice as well. So now, I look much more aggressively to prevent the Bishop sacrifice by my opponents. Either way it is a both strong and an exciting move, and most of times dramatically changes the course of the match. It sure did this time.} Qxd6 {So basically I have just cleared his pawn defense on his King, with minimal material disadvantage. In addition, my Queen is getting ready to get into the action, and his King looks pretty blocked off by the pieces on his f-file.} 16. Qe2 {With this move, I got impression that he still was not concerned that much by his lack of defense in front of his King. He is actually attacking. I thought that might have not been the best move, cause I was willing to sacrifice bunch of pawns to position my strong pieces in front of his King. I am sure not concerned with his attack of b5.} Qd7 {The menacing attack on h3. That had to grab his attention.} 17. Kg2 {Yep. Pretty much forced.} Ra4 {I am ready to get that Rook in the action. Perfect opportunity to start bringing heavy artillery in front of his King. However, it's still not perfectly clear where this rook will fit, due to his 3rd row pieces. I still don't care that my b5 pawn is there for taking. I am actually using it as a bait.  } 18. Qxb5 {He goes for it. Actually, I think here he is trying to generate some kind of attack on that side. And this attack has some legitimacy. However, my King is very well protected, his King is very vulnerable and I am mounting an attack. } Rg4+ {This is the move that was at the same time obvious as well as surprising. If he takes the rook the game is practically over, because I am then bringing Queen right in front of him, and with his King being blocked of with f-file pieces he is trapped and soon would be done. So he opts correctly not to take it.} 19. Kh2 {My rook is under attack. I considered sacrificing the rook again, but noticed at least 2 well thought-out sequence of moves that would get him out of the jam with a significant material advantage. Seeing his ranking has skyrocketed, by this time into 1800s, I realized he will find these moves, so I decided to retreat the rook but keep the g-file offense.} Rg6 20. Nc5 {I thought this was another attacking move where a defensive move might have been more appropriate. For some reason he still doesn't seem to see the danger of his situation.} Ng4+ {I am using the fact that g3 take would bring the Queen into action, to bring in more and more active pieces in front of his King. He still can't take the knight! } 21. Kh1 Qf5 22. Qe2 {Finally he abandons the attacks and brings his Queen back to defend. It was long overdue.. Few moves back I noticed that his advancing f2 pawn would bring a huge amount of relief to my attack, so I kept one eye on that. Whatever I was doing I wanted to make sure that he doesn't get to move his f2 pawn.} Qh5 {I was starting to consider a possibility of a win at this point.... h3 is under great deal of pressure.} 23. Ng1 {However, this move deflated my enthusiasm because I realized how much relief it brought to him. Not only that, but he gets the chance to forward his f2 pawn, he defends his h3 pawn, and also my Ng4 is pinned! He can't take Ng4 with his h3 pawn yet as it is masking the Queen attack, but this might change later. I was starting to get discouraged.... But I am still not giving up.... } e4 {I had no option. I wanted to bring in the other Knight into action, as I realized what I have so far is still not enough. Plus it brings some kind of protection against his f2 pawn advance. I still thought that advance of that pawn would have been a strong move whether I moved my e-pawn or not, however, at least I opened a landing spot for my c-Knight. } 24. Nxb7 {He still decides to take another worthless pawn. He must have been under impression that he would be able to defend my attack and come out of it with material advantage. Advancing f2 pawn IMO would have been much better move.} Nce5 {I am getting them all lined up and ready to strike. I really want to eliminate his g1 Knight! Also more pressure on f3 in case he is ready to move the f pawn.} 25. Bc3 {Still no f-pawn move?... Naturally I won't object, but now I am really closing in.} Nf3 {He is in clear trouble now. His Knight is under attack and once the Knight is gone so is the protection of his h3 pawn. } 26. Qxf3 {He is now forced to sacrifice! ...} exf3 27. Rad1 {At this point my focus remains tightening the grip on his King by bringing in as much of heavy artillery as possible. } Qh4 {Adding pressure on f pawn. The Nxf2 threatens.} 28. Rd2 {Forced, protecting the f-pawn.} f5 {I am not satisfied with current pressure, so I am trying to bring in the second rook. Probably unnecessary, but I want to make sure. He can't take d pawn and abandon the f-pawn protection.   } 29. b4 {He is probably thinking that his only chance is to try to Queen this pawn before I close in on him. Again, I might have focused more on the defensive move and bring his b-Knight more close to the action. But then again, maybe he had no choice. Either way it's desperation time for him, so he might as well try it.} f4 {That Rf1 really is itchin to get into action.} 30. exf4 Rxf4 {And here it does.} 31. Na5 d4 {Again, taking the d4 pawn would entail moving d-rook, and that is a no no, so he retreats.} 32. Bb2 Ne5 {With this move I opened g-rook attack on his strong g-Knight. I am ready to sacrifice my rook to take that Knight out if needed. } 33. Kh2 {He realizes that and protects the h3 pawn first.} Rg2+ {But then I decide not to take the Knight. This was practically it. The finishing moves were forthcoming.} 34. Kh1 Ng4 35. Nxf3 Qxh3+ {White here finally resigns.  The game wonderfully exemplified the importance of calculated sacrifice, for the sake of positional advantage. Once that King castles, always look for the opportunity to attack the pawn wall. Taking some hits and sacrifices for the sake of reorganizing your strong pieces in front of the helpless King can be much more valuable then the material advantage gained by your opponent. One more important thing is to make sure when attacking with the Q to have enough pieces accompanying the attack. I almost learned the hard way, as Q got into action a bit too early and I had to import accompanying pieces later on in hope he won't be able to bring the defense back in time. Had he not took so much moves attacking he might have been able to defend my attack.}
