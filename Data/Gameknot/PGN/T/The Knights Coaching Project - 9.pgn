1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Nxf7 {After I made this move I seen how I just threw the game away. The better move here would have been Bxf7 to put the king into check and take away Blacks castling rights and prevent development. By making the move Nxf7, I ignored all the principles.  } Qd4 {Expected. Now I can't castle because the Queen is attacking the g1 square and also attacking my Bishop on c3. } 8. h3 {What was I thinking here? c3 probably would have been a better move here as now the black Queen can capture my Bishop and attack my Night on f7.} Qxc4 {Expected.} 9. Nxh8 {Again I feel this might have been a bad move as blacks Night is still sitting on g4 and dangerous. I feel that hxNg4 would have been a better move here and blacks Queen would have captured my Night on f7 giving me some breathing room to develop.} Nh6 {Expected.} 10. c3 {I really had no idea what to do in this situation so I made the move c3 to stop Qxc2 where blacks queen would have been attacking my Bishop on c1.} Nf5 {Black is bringing is Night back into the action.} 11. Na3 {Again probably another pointless move trying to chase the queen away.} Qd3 {Expected.} 12. Nb5 {At this point I know the game is lost and start making pointless moves. Here I am trying to fork blacks King and Rook, but that plan never happened.} Ng3 {Expected.} 13. Kf2 {Trying to escape.} Nxh1+ {But it never worked.} 14. Kg1 {I moved my King here so I can capture blacks Night if blacks Queen captures my Night on b5.} Qxb5 {Yep, just as expected.} 15. Kxh1 {And now I can capture blacks Night.} Qf1+ {Expected.} 16. Kh2 {Trying to escape again.} Qxf4+ {Expected and I don't succeed in escaping.} 17. Kg1 {Back to g1.} Qf6 {Black is now chasing after my Night on h8.} 18. b3 {A pointless move I feel, maybe d3 would have been a better move to develop my Bishop.} g5 {Expected. There is nothing I can do to save my Night.} 19. c4 {ahhh?? I have no idea what I was thinking when I made that move and this is a clear example of not observing the board before each move.} Qxa1 {Expected and next will be my bishop.} 20. d3 {Pointless moves from here, the game is just about over.} Qxc1+ {Expected.} 21. Kf2 {probably not a good move, maybe h2 would have been better here.} e3+ {Expected.} 22. Ke2 {I was probably better moving to f3.} Qd2+ {Expected.} 23. Kf3 {Now I move to f3.} e2 {Black is advancing his pawn for promotion.} 24. Kf2 {That was a pointless move, probably better to move to e4.} e1=Q+ {Black promotes his pawn. Two moves to mate.} 25. Kf3 {The only square I can move to.} Qf4# {And that's game. Wow didn't I make a lot of blunders in this game and I certainly learned from it. Ignoring all the principles and not observing the board before each move is what lost the game for me. It has taught me to be more observant and take time on each move and even analise each move before making it.}
