1. d4 g6 2. e4 Bg7 {Bisguier forms a classical center: Larsen prefers a flank attack.} 3. f4 d6 4. Nf3 Nf6 {The first stab at the domineering central Pawns.} 5. Bd3 {Both players have now cleared the way for castling.} O-O 6. O-O {They both do so.} Nbd7 7. e5 {Trying to seize command of the game.} Ne8 {Larsen's position is getiing dangerously cramped. He must find a way to either gain space or exchange some pieces.} 8. Qe1 c6 9. f5 {Bisguier presses forward on the K-side.} dxe5 10. fxg6 hxg6 {Opening an avenue of attack for Bisguier on the KR file.} 11. Qh4 {Bisguier wastes no time seizing it.} exd4 {At least he has the consolation of grabbing some material.} 12. Bh6 {The beginning of the end.} Nef6 13. Ng5 {The attack gains strength every move.} Ne5 14. Rxf6 {The Rook is taboo [14...PxR? 15 BxB!]} Bh8 15. Rf1 Re8 {Attempting to create flight squares for the King.} 16. Bf8 {If Larsen takes the Bishop, it is mate on the move.} Bf6 {Hopeless.} 17. Rxf6 {Closing in for the kill.} exf6 {He may as well take. If he doesn't recapture, White simply retreats the Rook and even if a checkmate isn't forced immediately Bisguier has a winning material advantage.} 18. Qh6 {Mate in 1...} Rxf8 19. Qh7# {Brilliantly done by Bisguier.}
