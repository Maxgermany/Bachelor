1. Nf3 {hmmm....non committal - doh} d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Nc6 {totally winging this opening - think I should have played c5 before Nc6} 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 O-O 7. Rc1 Bb4 8. cxd5 exd5 9. a3 Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Qd6 11. Bd3 Qxa3 {questionable pawn grab - it's already apparent my opponent has all he needs to tear apart the kingside pawn shield} 12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Nh4 Ne7 {in anticipation - moving into g6 as a buffer} 14. Qh5 Ng6 15. Qh6 Qxc1+ {free rook - now if I can just weather the kingside attack} 16. Ke2 Qb2+ {decide to set myself up for a retreat downwards - my opponent could actually force a stalemate here but he's higher rated and thinks his attack has enough punch but I can't find a win here yet} 17. Kf3 Rd8 {a mistake - planning to give my king an escape should he knock out the f and h pawns and try a stalemate with the Q on the g and h squares} 18. Bf5 {dangerous - capturing the bishop here is mate in 2} Be6 {a bit better - if I knock out the bishop I don't need the f7 pawn anyways} 19. Bxe6 fxe6 20. Nxg6 hxg6 21. Qxg6+ {going to lose some pawns here - note my opponent can still stalemate by just putting me in check along the 6th rank until we repeat the position 3 times - } Kf8 22. Qxf6+ Ke8 23. Qxe6+ Kf8 24. h4 {a mistake - allows me to bring my queen back into the game and if I can trade them off, I win} Qb6 25. Qf5+ Kg7 26. Qe5+ Qf6+ 27. Qxf6+ Kxf6 28. g4 a5 {three passed pawns on the kingside - one passed pawn and a spare rook queenside - should be inneresting - LOL} 29. Kf4 a4 30. g5+ Ke6 {only safe bet - getting in front of pawn shield creates too many checks before I get to a1} 31. g6 a3 32. h5 a2 33. Ra1 Rdh8 {should have moved King into f6 - even wrote myself a note telling myself to pay attention but failed} 34. Kg5 Rhf8 {a recovery - I should be able to drive his K into the wall and move my king forward} 35. f4 Rf5+ 36. Kh6 Rh8+ {playing Kf6 is much stronger here I think and is faster} 37. Kg7 Rhxh5 38. Rxa2 {doh} Rh3 39. Ra8 {he's looking to play Re8  after I take the e3 pawn and pin the rook - notice as things stand I'm preventing a queening on g8 and his back rank is vulnerable - I'd have moved Re2 to slow me down - he's hoping I don't see the tactic but it's the only thing you can do going down there so I'm probably gonna spot it before the capture on e3} Ke7 {now I get opposition too} 40. Ra7 {no good - only picks up one pawn} Rxe3 41. Rxb7 Rxc3 42. Kh6 Kf6 {remembered f6 this time - LOL} 43. g7 {oversaw the mate attack -  I was thinking he'd play Kh7 but getting the pawn to g8 is no good - I play say, Rh3 and the Queen has to block the mate since there's no retreat to the g file for the queen} Rh3# {very enjoyable game - }
