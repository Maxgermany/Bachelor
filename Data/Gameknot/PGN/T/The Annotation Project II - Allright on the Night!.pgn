1. f4 {Hi everyone!  After dropping 6 points to Yoshark after conceding yet another unnecessary Low Draw late this afternoon, things worked out fine for The Beginner at 1146 GMT.  One little pawn move and then a few moves later I ended up delivering checkmate!  This victory almost cancelled out the points lost from the Low Draw in the Yoshark game so not such a bad day after all.  This is the Annotations Project Pt. 2  and we take up the action on Move 9 when I elect to play e6.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6 {9. ...... e6 - this was before it was pointed out that maybe Bg7 was the better move here.} 10. Nf7 Qf6 11. Ne5+ Kb6 {11. ...... Kb6 - Henry sidestepps a knight check.} 12. O-O Bc5+ 13. Kh1 Qe7 {13. ...... Qe7 - moving Glenda off the f column as an enemy rook is sitting on it.} 14. c3 c6 {14. ...... c6 - preparing to move Henry to c7.} 15. d3 exd3 16. Nxd3 {16. Nxd3 - pawn trade.} Nd7 {16. .... Nd7  - development.} 17. Nd2 Rae8 {17. ....... Rae8 - the back row decks are cleared and the rooks are now connected.} 18. b4 Bd6 19. Nc4+ Kc7 {19. ...... Kc7 - It looks as though I might suceed in achieving a queenside castle by hand here.} 20. a4 Kb8 {20. ...... Kb8 - mission accomplished.} 21. Be3 Bc7 22. b5 {22. b5 - pawn storm.} c5 23. a5 Bd8 24. Nde5 Nxe5 25. fxe5 {25. fxe5 - pawn trade.} Ref8 26. Rfd1 {26. Rfd1 - potential trouble for me on the a and d columns.} h5 {26. ....... h5 - I now try a pawn storm on the kingside.} 27. Bf3 Rxf3 28. gxf3 {28. gxf3 - I did not make the decision to trade rook for bishop here lightly but I thought it was essential to break up the bishop pair especially as Bob could play a move as Nd6, hitting at my b7 pawn.  This may, however open up attacking lines to the WK.} Qf8 29. Kg2 Be7 {29. ....... Be7 - Fou Lenoir is not happy on d6 so Glenda makes room for him to come to e7.} 30. Nd6 Bxd6 31. exd6 {31. exd6 - I decided to get rid of Bob's knight at the expense of Fou Lenoir.  It has given Bob a passer and I must beware of it.} Qf5 {31. ........ Qf5 - Glenda has had enough of defending on the back row so she defends the vulnerable c5 pawn from a more central square.  More crucially Glenda guards g5 preventing for the moment Bg5.  It is essential that she prevents this because my rook will be needed to block the d7 pawn.} 32. d7 Rd8 33. Rd2 g5 {33. ....... g5 - I have a little plan that involves opening up the WK and Glenda hassling him a bit.} 34. b6 a6 {34. ...... a6 - Henry is boxed in on b8 but at least Bob cannot attack him via the a column.} 35. Rad1 g4 {35. ....... g4 - after Bob reinforces his d7 pawn I now carry out my plan to open up the white king.  The g5 pawn is the scalpel.} 36. fxg4 Qxg4+ 37. Kh1 {37. Kh1?? - this move loses, you will see how in just one minute!} Qe4+ 38. Rg2 Qxe3 {38. ...... Qxe3 - Bob's dsb drops but that is only for starters!} 39. Rgd2 Qf3+ {39. ....... Qf3+ - the main course is yet to come ......} 40. Kg1 Rg8+ {40. ...... Rg8+ - the rook can now move away from d8 because it is check!  I announce mate next move and Bob permits it.  Commiserations Bob.} 41. Rg2 Qxg2# {}
