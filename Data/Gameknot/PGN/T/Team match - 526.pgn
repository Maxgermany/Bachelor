1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Standard opening.  Nothing fancy  e4 e5 nf3 nc6} 3. d4 {White moves her D pawn to the center to take control.} Bd6 {I move my bishop to cover my E pawn.  Probably could have done d6 instead, but I like this because it keeps my bishop out.  I also didn't want to lose a pawn by going nd4.} 4. d5 {She moves her D pawn forward to attack my knight.} Na5 {My first REALLY obvious mistake.  Instead of retreating to b8 or e7, or moving to a protected space b4, I go na5.} 5. b3 {She moves the B pawn forward, but instead of going b4 and trapping my knight, she only does b3.} Nf6 {I continue my development now that my other knight is "safe" (in other words, I never noticed it could easily get trapped).} 6. Bg5 {Bg5 to attack my knight, possibly interested in a trade, but a more creative way to defend e4 by pinning my Knight.} Bb4+ 7. c3 Bd6 {I use my bishop to put her in check and immediately retreat with the purpose of opening up her corners.} 8. Bxf6 gxf6 {Swap bishop for knight.  I take with pawn rather than queen to open up the rook now that her most likely castling side will be King side.} 9. b4 {She finally traps my knight.} b6 {Move my pawn in order to get something out of my loss.} 10. bxa5 bxa5 {Knight for pawn....o well.} 11. Bd3 {She continues development.} Rg8 {Rg8 puts her G pawn under attack.} 12. O-O {She castles to defend.} Bc5 {I move my bishop to pin her F pawn in addition to her G pawn which was pinned by virtue of castling.  Now she is susceptible to an attack.} 13. c4 {She continues her development, not knowing what lurks in the distance.} d6 {Now I can get my bishop into the mix.} 14. Qa4+ Kf8 {She puts me in check....moving her queen to the other side of the board from the action....since I don't want to swap queens, I move my king out of harms way.} 15. Nc3 Bh3 {Now I am in a favorable position.  A wrong move and its mate in 2.  } 16. Nh4 {Seeing the danger she moves her knight to defend her G pawn.  I'm not sure this is the best defense her.  The best defense for her king is clearly g3, but that would sacrifice a rook for a bishop (which would put us back to square...not a bad prospect.  I'm not really certain if g3 is the best move here.  I was honestly expecting ne1 which gets mostly the same results except the move she makes puts her knight in a much more vulnerable spot.  } f5 {I put her knight under attack.} 17. Kh1 {Interesting move here.  She either doesn't see the knight will be taken, or she doesn't care.  She wants to unpin her G and F pawns, which is acheived by moving her king, but leaves her knight undefended.  She could simply want to swap by subsequently taking my bishop, but she doesn't.  Perhaps she just didn't notice.} Qxh4 {I smell blood....} 18. g3 {On the surface this appears to be the best move, but as you will see, its not.} Bxf1 {To the untrained eye, I just gave up my queen for a rook....not so.  I've left my queen vulnerable in hopes that she takes the bait.  The trap is set.} 19. gxh4 Bg2+ 20. Kg1 Bh3+ {Move my victim into the corner...} 21. Kh1 Bxf2 {...seal off the exits...} 22. Ne2 {She may not realize that I can mate by bg2# or rg1# depending on her action.} Bg2# {...the finisher.}
