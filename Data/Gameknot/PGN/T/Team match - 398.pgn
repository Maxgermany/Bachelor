[Opening "KGA (C34), Becker defence"]

1. e4 {This is by far the most popular opening move.} e5 2. f4 {I personally don't like playing against the kings gambit. The centre usually belongs to white although you may have an extra pawn or not.} exf4 {exf4 if probably the best option. Second best would be d5} 3. Nf3 {Most popular and less riskiest ( Not sure if that is even a word) kings gambit continuation. This move prevent Qh4+} h6 {This is the Beckers defense. The idea is that it will support a g5 thrust and controls the aggressive square g5 for the knight.} 4. Bc4 {Continues to add pressure on f7. Any moment he can play Ne5} d6 {I have strong dark squares but weak light squares. } 5. O-O Be6 {Exchanging light squared bishops.} 6. d3 {Pretty strange move. The idea was probably that he didn't want me to take on e6 with my pawn and play e5 with a nice pawn chain.} Bxc4 7. dxc4 g5 {Protects the pawn. Notice how I've barely made any moves apart from pawn moves and exchanges.} 8. Qd4 {Attacks the rook.} Nf6 9. Re1 {Pressure on the e files.} Nc6 {Attacks the queen with tempo.} 10. Qc3 Be7 11. e5 dxe5 12. Nxe5 Qd4+ {Forces the exchange of queens.} 13. Kh1 Qxc3 14. Nxc3 Nd4 15. Rd1 Nxc2 16. Rb1 {he drops another pawn. I'm now 2 pawns up.} O-O 17. Nd5 Nxd5 18. Rxd5 Rad8 19. Nd7 c6 20. Rd2 {Chases the rook.} Bb4 21. Nf6+ Kh8 {Kg7 may have been better here.} 22. Rxd8 Rxd8 23. g4 {Must've made a pawn move or Rd1+ # } Rd1+ 24. Kg2 Ne1+ 25. Kf2 Nd3+ {Wins a piece or forces the exchange of more pieces. I'll be bishop and 2 pawns vs knight.} 26. Ke2 Rxc1 {RESIGNS. good game}
