[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 {As per Sue's request, I started with this opening.  She wanted to go into a different variation of the Sicilian then what I'm used to for experience.} c5 2. Nf3 g6 {As I am not used to seeing fianchettos this early in the Siclian.  Sure, I have seen it after 1...c5 but much later.  The only time I have seen this early was in the KID.  But, it shows how intense openings can be, especially if one is not careful.} 3. d4 {So, I play it normally, as if, it were the open variation since this pawn is always exchanged that way.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 {I had expected 4...Nf6 to threaten the pawn.  But, it gets played later.  Believe it or not, I was ready to exchange here but declined in case of 5...Nf6 which gets played.  That's because exchanging would make it much more difficult for me to defend the center pawn.} 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Nc3 {As this how I'm used to defending that pawn, especially in the Open Variation.  But, it works even in closed variations.} Bg7 {Continuing with her development by completing the fianchetto.} 7. Bd3 {And, I continue with my development.} O-O {Not surprisingly, Sue castles.} 8. e5 {But, I delay mine to strike at the center.} Ng4 9. Bf4 {As now, I can continue my development and might even be able to use this B pair, as I recently learned from GM Susan Polgar in the mega bundle course.} d6 {Trying to exchange pawns.  This time, without considering anything else, I willing accept.  The reason for exchanging is that it will strengthen my Bf4 as it will have more mobility since it's not interfered by the very pawn that's coming off the board.} 10. exd6 exd6 11. O-O {Not knowing what else to do, and given that my development is complete, I castle here.   Better, however, was to defend with 11.Rb1 because of the threat against my b2 pawn. } Be6 {Meanwhile, Sue completes her development.  But, as black, though, I would've taken the pawn.} 12. Ne4 {With d5 attacked once, I decide to attack again by centralizing my Nc3.  What I forgot while looking variations, even after 12...Bxb2 is that what I want would fail since the Rook is attacked.  So, I was thinking about 12...Bxb2 13.Nxd6 with the idea that it's even, but I forgot to ask myself what happens after losing the exchange to 13...Bxa1.  The issue is that I still do not look at enough variations, despite the first training game with Ken.  Which means that it's something I forget way too easily, and thus, needs work on as my thought process just isn't completely there which isn't good, especially when I'm training someone. } d5 {Sue tries to stop it with this move.  But, taking on b2 would've stopped.  It's still possible, even after what follows.} 13. Nd6 {But, I decide to add more pressure because as Ken told me during our training games, it's about to handle the pressure.  And, I got the idea from him since he kept adding pressure against me when I thought that it was all over.  As now, one of the threats is the b7 pawn, but there might be others later.  For example, taking attacks the Queen, and if ...Qe8, I can attack with something like Nd6.  So, there are some very interesting variations that come into this move.  The only thing, that I keep missing, though, is that my b2 pawn is hanging, and the pressure could fail if she wins that pawn.} b6 {Not Surprisingly, Sue defends the pawn.  But, better was 13...Bxb2, in which attacking the Queen wouldn't work because of ...Qc8.} 14. Bb5 {But, with my LSB, I don't attack the Queen right since the N is now under siege.  This time, though, I am not concerned and gave it, for the first time, some thought.  That's because if after 14...Bxb2 15.Bxc6 Bxa1 16.Bxa8 Qxa8 17.Qxa1 white hasn't lost material, and is, in fact, a piece up with a better position since this variation involves liquidation, after the fact.  However, I should've been concerned and thought more about this earlier since black could've gotten a free pawn.  With this being said in the after math of this move, Sue makes the right choice by defending the N.  In fact, I said, which I seem to remember and hopefully just before this move.  But, I said that right now, black is fine. But, best for black would've been to take my e5 pawn. As then, you'd be a pawn up, even if I were to take back.} Ne7 15. Rb1 {In the aftermath, I take away the opportunity for black to get that pawn.} a6 {My guess is that Sue figured out what opportunity, and thus, attacks my Bb5 which I will defend.} 16. Ba4 b5 {Not surprisingly, Sue attacks again.} 17. Bb3 {And, I defend again.} Nc6 {? I presume that black wanted to put her N to a better outpost since I did mention that in the Deeper Chess Theory Club.  And, that was before reposting it in bhidragon's post about a 1700s study and a book by Bob Fischer about this.  But, it is Sue's first mistake as it will lose a pawn.  In fact, I said, ? I know that you wanted to get your N to a better spot since it is about getting your pieces to a better square. But, better was to leave your N on e7. In this position, it was better placed. As that was keeping your d5 pawn protected.} 18. Bxd5 Bxd5 19. Qxd5 Nb4 {? Not surprised to see my Q attacked.  Here, I gave advise but was a little off, as Sue will only lose a pawn and not a piece.  I did say that I will cost material, but I thought it was a pawn.  However, it was just one move that I overlooked which was 20...a5 since in all other variations, black loses a piece.  But, it was 20...a5 that I overlooked.  But, losing a pawn isn't completely off.  So, I was a little overly critical but not completely to say ?? I understand why you played this. As the Queen appears attacked. But, black has other options, like 19...Nb8, 19...Na7. I don't like it on a7 as well as it's on the rim. And, bringing back to b8 does undevelop, though from there, it can go to d7, followed by f6 with a nice position. However, best was 19...Ne7, as now I'm forced to retreat. And, from there, black 20...Nf5 where the N is well placed. But, this move, however, is going to lose more material.  Correcting a little bit of what I said, I reposted by saying,  Edit: 19...Nb8?? does not work as the Rook is not protected. But, better was 19...Na7, or 19...Ne7 However, for the reasons noted, 19...Ne7 was best. Therefore, it's actually would've been more accurate to post it as ? then an ?? move since it's nothing terrible. } 20. Qc5 a5 21. Nxb5 Qf6 {The idea here is connecting her Rooks.  But, I would've played 21...Qb8 to prevent what's to come.  As that way, Sue would later be able to connect the Rooks without the Q being attacked.} 22. Bg5 Qe6 23. Nc7 {Calculating variations and thinking a little about what to do combined with memorizing some of the chess problems in her book about forks from, "Tactics for Champions", I decide to fork Sue's Qe6 and Ra8.  It ought to not be effective or work, but I am interested in what happens since the first thing she'll notice is the Queen being attacked.} Qd7 {But, this is decisive mistake, and thus, the losing blunder.  Up until this point, although not an ideal position, black was fine.  With this move, black will lose the exchange, after which, it will go downhill.  So, I said ?? It is good that you realized that the Queen was attacked. However, 23.Nc7 was a forking move because your Ra8 was also attacked. Despite losing another pawn, 20...a5! was a good move and the only one in the sequence that I overlooked. But, in this position, with two pieces attacked, you could have defended both with 23...Qc8. As now, my N is pinned to the Queen. And, after something like 24.Bf4 Ra7 25.c3 Na6 26.Nxa6 Rxa6 27.Qxc8 Rxc8 white doesn't win anything else.  But, after that, I wasn't going to give any more advise because of what ION said.  And, that is not to critical when you have the winning advantage.  As up until this point, there was no clear winning initiative, even if white had an advantage.  That's so, but an advantage doesn't necessarily mean winning.  It's different, when one is more then a piece up.  And, after this game, I brought her back to this position and showed her how powerful the pin would've been.} 24. Nxa8 Rxa8 25. Rbd1 {With my advantage, I centralize my Rook by attacking the Queen.  As this will pose as a potential threat on the eighth rank.} Qb7 {Which becomes evident with this move, as I will exchange Rooks since the idea is liquidating when ahead.  And, that's why it is, in general, a win when you are up a piece or more.} 26. Rd8+ Rxd8 27. Bxd8 Bf8 28. Qc4 {I could've taken on a5, but with this move, there will be a threat against the King is of even more importance since not only did 28.Qxa5 also come into consideration.  But, that was almost the move that I played, until I studied what's to come.} Qb8 {Attacking my Bd8, and then some.} 29. Bc7 {That's because, as bad as it is, I almost made a terrible and obvious blunder being 29.Ng5?? to follow up on the 28.Qc4 which is why I didn't take on a5.  That's because as it will turn out later, the idea is that after Ng5, I'd follow up by capturing with the Queen on f7, and then h7 where it is mate.  And, it would be if Sue saw the threat and protected.  Or if she would overlooking it by taking the B since I'd be giving something back, and as a method, that's generally what you do when ahead.  However, mate is almost threatened, and with it, I, very nearly, overlooked 29...Qxh2#  That not only would've thrown away the advantage in a winning position.  But, as it is a teaching, Sue would not have learned, as then, she'd be able to pull a swindle.  And, the idea is that once you have advantage, if can be avoided, you don't want to give the student their advantage back, as Ken emphasized before our training sessions.  That is why I am upset with myself.  It's a good thing that I used analyze the board, but the bad part is that it got me spoiled since I overlooked a similar threat against Jack Stockel and got mated on the back rank.  The point is that before even using analyze the board, I should've seen the threat, rather then need to see what the opponent or in this case, the student was threatening.  Now, I could've protected with 29.g3, but when you see a good move, look for something better.  I thought that this was better since there is the added threat against the Queen, in which must be protected.  As now, g5 square won't be blocked which will allow me to play the same thing that would've lost with this move.  So, what I'm alluding is, indeed, 30.Ng5.} Qb7 30. Ng5 {As now, it will be difficult but not impossible to defend against the threat.  There is only move that will prevent mate, but I would keep the winning advantage.} Bh6 {?? Not surprisingly, Sue attacks the N.  But, it doesn't defend against the threat.  Of course, I can take her Ng4 and be further up, but why do that when I can win the King.  For black, the only way to prevent mate was 30...Nh6, after which, I'd capture with 31.Bxa5.  Not only would be another pawn up, but it would be very difficult for Sue to defend her Nb4.  In fact, after that, I'd threaten, perhaps, mate again with something like Bb4 forcing further liquidation, and perhaps, a later Qc5 with Qe7 or Re1 in mind.  All of that would add more pressure to the King but would not mate at once.  With this move, I have it and will take advantage of that opportunity.} 31. Qxf7+ Kh8 32. Qxh7# {Right after this game, is when I used the fen for right after 23.Nc7 and boiled it down to the moral of the story.  So, I said, you played very well in our game.  Your decisive mistake was overlooking a pin.   As you were down two pawns. But, had you played ...Qc8, my N would've been tied down with the pin. At that point, I wouldn't have been able to take your Rook. So, what you remember for the future is how powerful the pins can be. Sometimes, they're not a big deal. Or another way of looking at it is just a nuicanse. But, other times they can be very dangerous, so you want to ask yourself when it's serious or not. If you're not sure, it's better to assume that the pins can do a lot because that is true, more often then not.  }
