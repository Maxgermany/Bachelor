1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {All book, so far.} Nf6 {Challenging the center.} 5. Nc3 {Developing and guarding.} g6 6. f4 Bg4 {Striving for counterplay.} 7. Bb5+ {Turnabout is fair play.} Nbd7 {Keeping his threat on the Q active.} 8. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {Refusing to relinquish the tempo by recapturing with the B.} 9. Qd3 e5 {Trying to drive White back.} 10. Nf3 {Countering with a threat on the KP.} Bxf3 {Opting to exchange.} 11. Qxf3 {With the threat of PxP and a discovery on the unguarded Knight.} Qg4 {The losing move.} 12. Nd5 {Spassky resigns. White has too many threats [NxN winning a piece, N-B7 ch with a shakrukh]. There's no way to defend all of them. Exchanging Queens first doesn't help, as Korchnoi can win a piece [after 12... QxQ] with 13 NxN ch! before recapturing the Q. Spassky could save the piece with 12... K-Q1, but after 13 NxN Q-R5 ch 14 P-N3 QxN, Korchnoi has a winning positional advantage with his absolute control of Q5 and the backward Black Q-pawn, not to mention that the Black King would be trapped in the center and wide open to attack.}
