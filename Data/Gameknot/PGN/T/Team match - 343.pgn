[Opening "Two knights defence, Keidanz variation (C55)"]

1. e4 {When I first learned to play, I learned to start with e4. But there is so much material to learn for the Sicilian that I decided with my coaches encouragement to change to d4 and later to c4 as my opening. I do not like to play e4 against players rated over 1600, but I feel I must do so as a surprise sometimes. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {This move puts us either into the two Knights or four Knights and I am very comfortable with those. I am also comfortable with Bc5 and the the Evans Gambit. Too bad I didn't get to play that here.} 4. d4 {I rarely play the Scotch, but my coach has encouraged me to do so, and I recently spent 4 hours of training on the opening with my coach, so I decided to play it for the experience.} exd4 5. e5 {This is a  safer line, in my opinion than the Scotch Gambit.} d5 6. Bb5 {exf6 is just not sound, and retreating the Bishop to b3 is good, but it does not seem to be in the spirit of this opening. so I choose to try and keep pressure on my opponents.} Nd7 {The first move I feel that really required some thought. This breaks the pin and starts an attack on the e5 pawn, but it is a bit ugly. Now the Bishop on c8 is a prisoner.} 7. O-O Be7 {Opening theory has several options here. I could certainly exchange the Knight on c6, but the pawn structure hasn't been settled yet, and it could open up. I will hold onto the Bishop pair just a bit longer, to see how things unfold.} 8. Re1 O-O 9. Bxc6 {This is why I have trouble with correspondence chess. Sometimes you forget your plans from the day before. I should have continued to develop. But I forgot my plan to keep the Bishop pair, and I noticed I could get my pawn back without any trouble, so I did so.} bxc6 10. Nxd4 Bb7 {This is Black's first really hard decision. I have taken us out of book with my mix-up, but Black must figure out what to do about the pawn on c6. I understand this move, but I think Nb8 is more accurate. It allows the Bishop to develop to a much better square. I think this Bishop stayed stuck for quite some time.} 11. Nf5 {I considered Nc3 and Bf5, but I realized that the Bishop is already developed in this case. I am going to attack the King, and the Bishop can get there as easily from c1 as from any place else. I did not like Nc3 because it didn't support my idea of a King side attack. I think I missed the idea of Nd2, with Nf3 to follow, but it looked ugly to Block my Bishop and it seemed to take a long time for my attack to develop if I started with Nd2.} Re8 12. Qg4 {Okay} g6 {Okay...this is a mistake. The King will become exposed. I am going to have a very strong attack, based on the calculation Nh6+, Kg7, Nxf7, Kxf7 e6+! Kg8, exd7 which opens the King up for an attack and wins a pawn. I don't think we need to calculate beyond Nh6+, Kh8 we all know the Black Queen would be lost.} 13. Nh6+ Kg7 14. Nxf7 Kxf7 15. e6+ Kg7 {Okay...so Kg7...I missed this possible move. But the effect is the same.} 16. exd7 Rf8 17. Qh3 {Maybe I should have developed the Knight instead, but I just saw the King and Rook lined up on that diagonal, and I just didn't feel I was losing too much time setting up the possible tactic. It couldn' lose too much time because Black must prevent the tactic before he can start his own operations.} Rf5 18. Qb3 {Again...loose pieces...but here is where I should have been developing. This was just plain bad. Bh6+ develops with tempi...I see it now, but I missed it during the game.} Bc5 19. Qc3+ d4 20. Qb3 {hmmm...perhaps I helped Black here a bit...Again, I missed an opportunity to develop.} Qxd7 21. Qxb7 {Qxb7??...what a blunder! I had a comfortable lead, and I didn't take time to calculate Black's possible responses.} Re8 {My back rank is weak, and all because I wasted so much time not developing. Then when I made my error I completely lost control of the position.} 22. Rxe8 Qxe8 23. Qxc7+ {What can I do? I need time to regroup my pieces I am getting ready to resign. I can't cover my back or second rank sufficiently, and Qa5 can't work because of d3, and the threat of Bxf2+ winning the Queen.} Rf7 {Black has given me a break. Kg8 keeps the pressure on. You see, the Rook on f5 prevents the Queen from going back to a5 because of discovered attacks available.} 24. Qa5 d3 25. Bd2 {Okay...it is bad, but I am starting to rebuild. e1 is now safe...the problem is the Knight on b2 and the Rook on a1. If I solve them both I can equalize.} Bxf2+ {I am not being given any breathing room. This move really keeps the pressure on.} 26. Kh1 Qe2 {Wow...The King on g7 and not g8 is the only opportunity for me to solve my problem.} 27. Bc3+ Kh6 28. Nd2 {With the tempi gained, I secure my back rank.} Be1 29. h3 {Finally, I can open a small back door for my King.} dxc2 {Well...this looks threatening, but it is wrong. Black has lost control of the game now. White is still that Bishop that was captured at the wrong time up, and Black needs to change his mind set and go for the draw by repetition. Rf1+, Nxf1, Qxf1+, Kg2, Qf4+ and its a draw.} 30. Qa4 {Now there is no draw available} g5 {This is the last real mistake. The King can be checked with the capture of the pawn, and White's pieces suddenly have a serious attack.} 31. Qxc6+ Kh5 32. Nf3 Bxc3 {After taking the Bishop here, Black realized that g4 was mate, and resigned. But I think I had good control at this point...alternative moves seem to allow White to simplify the position or hold onto the lead.}
