1. e4 {My usual opening.} c5 {Introducing the Sicilian defense, one of the best answers to 1.e4. The idea is to play cxd4 when white play d4.} 2. Nf3 {Preparing 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4.} d6 {This move is important to prevent white from playing e5 after black plays Nf6. It also opens the h3-c8 diagonal for LSB. } 3. d4 {Controlling the center.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Threatening the e4 pawn and developing a piece.} 5. Nc3 {Protecting the e4 pawn and developing a piece.} a6 {This is the Sicilian Najdorf defense. 5...a6 is played to prevent white from playing Nb5 or Bb5. It also prepares a minority attack by b5.} 6. Bg5 {The main line. It threatens to double black's pawn on the f-file. It also prepare O-O-O after queen moves.} e6 {To avoid a doubled pawns on the f-file.} 7. f4 {Allowing 8.e5 pinning the f6 knight.} Qb6 {Attacks the b2 pawn. Usually this opening leads to a very complicated positions. Safer is 7...Nbd7, 7...Be7 or 7...Qc7.} 8. Qd2 {Now, this is the Sicilian Najdorf Poisoned pawn variation. White allows black to capture a pawn or more to have an open game and dangerous attack.} Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 {Forced.} 10. e5 {More plyable is 10.f5.} dxe5 11. fxe5 Nfd7 12. Ne4 {According to G/K analyse, this is a mistake -1.50 (12. Ne4 Qxa2 13. Rb3 h6 14. Bh4 Qa4 15. Nd6+ Bxd6 16. exd6 Nc6 17. Nf3 O-O 18. Be2 Qa1+ 19. Qd1 Qxd1+ 20. Bxd1 b5). It suggests 12.Bc4 as the best =0.00 } Qxa2 {Now, black is up 2 pawns.} 13. Rd1 Qd5 14. Qe3 Qxe5 {And this is the third.} 15. Be2 Nc6 16. O-O Nxd4 17. Rxd4 h6 {17...h6? G/K analyse didn't comment on this move. However, i think this is the losing move. It allows white to attack the queen and then putting pressure on black's king. Best in my openion is 17...Bc5! 18.Nxc5 Qxe3+ 19.Bxe3 Nxc5 20.Rg4 Nd7 21.Rxg7 with a draw.} 18. Bf4 {The best. If 18.Bh4? loses to 18...Bc5! ( notice that white can't play 19.Nxc5? because of 19...Qxe3+ winning).} Qa5 19. Nd6+ Bxd6 20. Bxd6 {From now till the end of the game, black's king can't castle and is in great danger.} Nf6 21. Bf3 {Preventing 21...Nd5 and controlling the f3-a8 diagonal.} Qb5 {GK analyse showed that 21...Qb5 is a mistake and better is 21...Qb6 (which i disagree with) as after 21...Qb6 22.Qe5 Bd7 23.Bc5 Qd8 24.Rfd1 Qb8 25.Bd6 Qa7 26.Kh1 (or an immediate Ba3 leads to the same) Bc6 27.Ba3! Qb8 28.Qc5 Qc7 29.Bxc6+ bxc6 30.Rd7 Qxd7 31.Rxd7 Kxd7 32.Qd6+ Kc8 33.Qxc6+ Kd8 34.Qxa8+ Kc7 35.Qxh8 wins easily.} 22. Rb4 Qd7 {Trying to keep the b7 pawn and to help defending the king.} 23. Rd1 {Putting more pressure on black's cramped position.} a5 {What else can black do?} 24. Rc4 {24.Rb6 is also winning. But 24.Rc4 is better and faster. It threatens 25.Rc7.} Qb5 {To allow 25...Bd7 after 25.Rc7.} 25. Rc7 {Here, black resigned as white is keeping on attacking with all of his pieces while black can't improve his hopeless position at all (his exposed king and misplaced pieces on a8, h8, c8,and his queen and knight have nothing to do). For example, 25...Bd7 (to avoid 26.Re7+) 26.Rxb7 Qg5 (if 26...Qc4 27.Ba3! Rc8 28.Qb6 Qc3 29.Qd6 and black must sacrifice his queen to avoid getting matted) 27.Qb6 winning easily.}
