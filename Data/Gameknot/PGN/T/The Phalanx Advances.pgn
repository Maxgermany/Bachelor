1. e4 {Team Match, I'm playing white and start with the Open Game.} g6 2. d4 {Black is playing the Modern Defense and white is playing along with the main line.} Bg7 3. Nc3 {Main line.} d6 4. f4 {Still main line, known as the Austrian Attack.} Nf6 5. Nf3 {And now we've transposed to the Pirc-Robatsch Defense.} Bg4 6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 {Supporting white's pawn center without doubling or isolating any pawns.} c6 8. Be3 O-O 9. O-O-O {Opposite side castling, but white had little choice given the state of his kingside pawns. White is planning a pawn avalanche on the kingside, usually a good way to break open a fianchettoed castle.} a6 10. g4 {The white pawns form a formidable phalanx in the center.} Qc7 11. f5 {The phalanx advances, intending to break up black's castle.} Nbd7 12. fxg6 fxg6 13. Bc4+ {Connecting the rooks more than anything else, but it does put the bishop on a useful square. Black's rook on f8 is ready to discover an attack against white's queen if the black knight on f6 moves. At the moment, black has no threat with that knight, so there is no danger yet to the white queen, or to any white pawns or pieces the black knight might capture in moving.} Kh8 14. h4 b5 15. Be6 {Invading enemy territory.} Nb6 16. h5 {More assault on black's castle. This one worried me a bit because of black's rook on f8. I had to work this one out carefully to make sure white isn't just throwing away the pawn.} Nxh5 17. Qh3 {The discovered attack against the white queen prevents 17. gxh5??. Instead, white plays 17. Qh3! pinning the black knight to the pawn on h7. If the knight moves, white plays 18. Qxh7#, unless the knight finds a square where it can protect that h7 pawn.} Nf6 18. g5 {Black saved his knight and defended the pawn at h7, but now white advances with 18. g5! driving the knight away from his defensive post.} Nh5 19. Ne2 {With 18. ... Nh5, the black knight returns to h5 blocking white's mating threat, but it is now pinned there with no safe moves to escape. White plays 19. Ne2, intending 20. Ng3 to win the black knight on h5 (not 20. ... Nxg3??? 21. Qxh7#, and after 21. Nxh5 gxh5, 22. Qxh5, black cannot stop 23. Qxh7#). But this was not white's best move here, as black's reply proves.} d5 20. Bg4 {Black covered g3 with his queen, so now 20. Ng3? is answered by 20. ... Qxg3 (not 20. ... Nxg3???, 21. Qxh7#). Instead, white finds the move he should have played instead of 19. Ne2. Black's in a bit of trouble here, and really has no moves that don't lose material. Black can probably survive the mating net by running his king over to the queenside, but doing so will be costly.} Nc4 21. Bxh5 Qa5 22. Bxg6 {Black now has a 2-move checkmate (Qxa2 and Qa1#). But it isn't forced, so even though it's black's move, black cannot play 22. ... Qxa2??? or he loses instantly to white's 1-move checkmate 23. Qxh7#} h6 23. gxh6 {Black played the only move that postpones his demise, and he's still threatening his own 2-move mate.} Kg8 24. hxg7 {23. ... Kg8??? was the critical mistake. Black could have averted immediate mate with 23. ... Bf6, which would have blunted white's attack and forced white to deal with black's mating threat. At this point, white has a forced checkmate in 3. Do you see it? OK, I'll point it out just in case: 24. Qe6+ Kh8 25. hxg7+ Kxg7 26. Rh7# or if 24. ... Rf7 25. Qxf7+ Kh8 26. Qxg7#. But in the game I didn't see it. I had been working to open that h-file and it was finally open, so I focused on that H-file and I saw a forced checkmate there first, and that's when I stopped analyzing and started moving. Hey, it was a forced win. Sure, the priests would say that a quicker forced win is more elegant, and they're right. I should have found 24. Qf6+!, but I forged ahead with the checkmate I had found.} Kxg7 25. Qh7+ {Here I announced mate in 3. Do you see it? I'm not going to tell you this one.} Kf6 26. Bg5+ {The courageous bishop sacrifices his life for the quick mate. Longer mates, starting with moving a rook to f1, don't require the bishop to lay down his life.} Ke6 27. Qxe7# {Black chose a quicker checkmate. He could have played 26. ... Kxg5 27. Qxe7+ (sacrificing a second bishop) Kxg6 28. Rdg1# or black could try leave the second bishop alive with 27. ... Kg4 but then that very bishop gets him with 28. Bh5#.}
