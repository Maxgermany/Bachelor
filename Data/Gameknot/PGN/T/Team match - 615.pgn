1. e4 {My opponent moves his king's pawn to free his bishop and queen...} e5 {...and I do likewise, with the King's Pawn game...} 2. Qh5 {...and he unleashes his queen to threaten my pawn, with the Patzer opening...} Qf6 {...so I cover it with my queen...} 3. Qf3 {...so he retreats his back to his 3rd rank...} Nc6 {...and I bring up my knight on the queenside, to try to get ahead in development...} 4. Bb5 {...and he attacks it with his light-square bishop...} Nd4 {...so I put it on the attack to threaten the queen and bishop, and possibly to win a pawn and rook...} 5. Qd3 {...forcing her into a passive position...} Bc5 {...so I bring out my dark-square bishop to continue my development, and to take more control of the centre...} 6. Nf3 {...so he brings out his kingside knight...} Nxf3+ {...but I can't resist capturing it with my knight...} 7. Qxf3 {...forcing him to capture it with his queen...} Qxf3 {...and I can't resist capturing her with my queen...} 8. gxf3 {...forcing him to distort his pawn structure, doubling on f2 and f3.} c6 {I now move up the pawn in front of my light-square bishop to attack his bishop...} 9. Bc4 {...forcing it back...} Nf6 {...and I continue my development with my remaining knight, to regain some control over the centre...} 10. d3 {...and he moves his queen's pawn to free his other bishop...} O-O {...and I castle kingside to bring a rook into play...} 11. Nc3 {...and he contests the centre with his remaining knight...} b5 {...so I move up the pawn in front of my sacrificial knight to free my light-square bishop...} 12. Bb3 {...forcing his bishop back further.} a5 {I now advance the pawn in front of my queenside rook to apply some pressure down her side...} 13. a3 {...but he only moves his one space...} a4 {...so I can advance mine to the 5th rank, to create a pawn chain, also threatening the bishop.} 14. Ba2 {His light-square bishop hides behind his rook's pawn...} b4 {...so I pressure the pawn with mine...} 15. Ne2 {...forcing the knight to retreat, to avoid a potential pin...} d5 {...so I bring up my queen's pawn to attack his king's pawn...} 16. exd5 {...so he captures it with his pawn, which is what I was hoping for...} Nxd5 {...and I capture with my knight...} 17. Bxd5 {..and lose it to the bishop...} cxd5 {...which is recaptured by my pawn, meaning that I now have four pawns at least on the 4th rank, where the two in the middle (e5, d5) are controlling the middle four squares on the 5th rank (f4, e4, d4, c4), and the two on the edge (b4, a4) are possibly threatening promotion by controlling the 6th rank (c3, b3, a3), so the only safe move for the knight at this rate is g1.} 18. Bd2 {He pressures my pawn on b4...} bxa3 {...so I capture his on a3...} 19. bxa3 {...and he captures back, opening up the b-file...} Rb8 {...so I place my rook on it...} 20. Nc3 {...not realising that his knight was about to fork two pawns (a and d)...} Bb7 {...so I defend my d-pawn with my bishop...} 21. Nxa4 {...but lose my a-pawn.} Rfc8 {I now defend my dark-square bishop with my kingside rook...} 22. Nxc5 {...and he captures my bishop with his knight...} Rxc5 {...so I capture back with my rook, threatening the pawn that started in front of his remaining bishop.} 23. Kd1 {He moves his king to cover...} d4 {...so I advance my d-pawn to clear the way for my bishop, threatening the pawn on f3, and the rook on h1...} 24. a4 {...and what was he doing, advancing his queenside rook's pawn...} Bxf3+ {...when I could capture a doubled isolated pawn on f3, forking the king and rook...} 25. Kc1 {...forcing his king to move out of the way...} Bxh1 {...so I could therefore claim his rook?} 26. a5 {His surviving rook's pawn advances to my 4th rank...} Ra8 {...so I line it up with my queenside rook...} 27. a6 {...and the pawn advances to my 3rd rank...} Rc7 {...so I retreat my kingside rook to cover my 2nd rank...} 28. Kb2 {...and he moves his king to expose my bishop...} Rca7 {...and I double up on his pawn. My opponent resigned after this. If he hadn't, what would have been the best way for me to proceed, and how would I have made the most of my advantage to win?}
