[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {Pretty standard opening move} e6 2. a3 {Now I've had people question the motive behind pawn a3 or pawn h3, but it's because it helps me set up future positions and a safe point if it comes to pass in the future. Obviously we are only 2 moves into this game so I don't know what will happen further down the line.} Nc6 3. Nf3 h6 {Black does same move to protect threat of Bg5} 4. Bf4 Nf6 5. h3 {Ultimately I prefer the Bishops to always have some pressure on Black pawn at c7 in case they castle. Same goes for White bishop currently at f1. Although looks like Black is more likely to O-O} Nd5 6. Bg3 {I push B to g3 instead of h2 because I was very confident that he'd castle on the bishop side. I didn't want to be in the Rh1 way when I tried for the backdoor checkmate} Be7 7. e3 {Opens up White bishop to move} a6 8. Qd2 {If anything it was to move queen out of the Kings path for a castle if needed} O-O {As expected, Black castle which now I hope to set up solid positions to trap Black King in end game} 9. Bd3 d6 10. Nc3 {Nc3 to tempt Black knight into trading} Nxc3 {Accomplished} 11. Qxc3 Bf6 12. O-O-O {My goal is to eventually remove black pawn from h6 and use rooks to trap Black King at g8. Also at some point get White Queen back to d2 for further development} Ne7 13. h4 {In order to remove Black pawn from h6 it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice a piece. Pawn to h4 supports the future sacrifice to take and open the H file} Nd5 {Thankfully Black threatened my queen so I could put her into a solid position without wasting a turn. Note* Won't look like much of a "solid" position but for the sake of the end game it does what it's meant to do.} 14. Qd2 {"Solid" position haha} Nb6 15. b3 Nd5 {Black knight regresses into same position again} 16. e4 {Pawn threatens Black knight but actually helps put pressure on black pawn at h6 for backdoor checkmate. Note* If you can't see it yet give it a few moves} Nb6 17. Bf4 {With this, the attack begins. To be honest I don't think Black fully saw what i was ultimately going for due to lack of piece positions which I believe to be the downfall} e5 18. dxe5 dxe5 {When Black took pawn to threaten Bf4 it opened up D file to put pressure on White bishop and trap my queen. Coincidentally in this moment I found an alt checkmate if my next move sacrifice proved ineffective.} 19. Bg5 {The sacrifice} hxg5 20. hxg5 {The support takes which opens H file} Bxg5 21. Nxg5 {At this moment I have total advantage with H file open to my rook. Also this is where the alt checkmate would come into play if he moved Black pawn to f6 to threaten knight, I'd move Bishop to C4 (check) which opens my queen to freely take his. He would either take my bishop with is knight or block with his rook but the end result would be checkmate.} Qf6 {Alt checkmate has been halted. Didn't fully understand Black move at this time, but still had major threat of H file to use} 22. Rh2 {Obvious move so that rook d1 can move to endgame at h1} Qf4 {Black threatens rook and pins queen to king. Not much of a threat due to position of white pieces} 23. Rdh1 {defends rook and sets up checkmate(1)} g6 {Prevents checkmate temporarily } 24. Qxf4 exf4 {Obvious exchange which lets white pawn advance to e5 to block f6 tile} 25. e5 {Black resigned after this move but there wasn't much that could be done to prevent checkmate.  *Any move made after move 25 is just my imagination of the last few moves, but regardless of any move made by black checkmate was guaranteed } Bh3 26. Rh2xh3 f6 27. Rh3h8+ Kg7 28. Rh1h7# {}
