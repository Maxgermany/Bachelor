1. e4 {One the always dangerous past pawn - which I had two of in this game The power a pawn sac can give your other pieces by opening lines for bishops - in this game my opponent did not take the pawn and allowed my to get the past pawns but I still got to open the lines!!  Thanks to my friend WINECAPE who showed me this in one of his other games I will be using that trick more often!!!   This was a rematch, I was one pawn up in the 1st game when I grabbed another pawn and my opponent split my queen and King with a bishop and accordingly I resigned the game. Greed - still one of the 7 deadly sins!!  I wanted to show the power a pawns in this game in two ways.  } e5 2. Nf3 {my standard opening} Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 {to here it was a copy of our previous games} 4. d4 {Instead of my ussual Kc3 I wanted to open up the game and get a centralized queen early on} exd4 5. Nxd4 {Exchange accepted} Nxd4 6. Qxd4 {Accepted} Qe7 7. Nc3 {trying to develop} c6 {The only function this could have was a push on d5, which did not seem to be a problem yet} 8. e5 {SO I tried to stop it with empasant - not seeing my pawn was pinned by his queen..... small mistake} d5 9. Bd3 {No option but to move it and d3 seems to be the best outpost for the time} Be6 10. O-O {Rex to safety} b6 11. Bd2 {NOt worried about c5 yet} Qc5 12. Qh4 {No exchange so early} Be7 13. Qg3 {expected} g5 14. Be3 {I was hoping to get his queen out of the midfield, i saw the split and also saw the way out} d4 {expected} 15. Ne4 {Planned - I thought he would play Qb4 at least staying in some kind ofattacking zone} Qa5 {So a free pawn.... munch munch} 16. Bxd4 {Why not, I saw the next move and had planned for it} O-O-O 17. Bc3 {just going with it, could not have planned it better my self} Qd5 18. Rfd1 {Getting on the open file - hoping for a check with Ba6 and stealing his queen.... Kb7 still loses the queen and so does Kd7} Kc7 {he saw it to - this or B8 is both bad, you will see why later, but there was no other options Kd7 and Kb7 still loses the queen } 19. f4 {So here comes the power of the pawns, Here I was willing to sac two pawns to open lines for my bishops, a trick I learned from my friend WINECAPE.  It is more important to keep your pieces in the game than to be a pawn up or down!!!  So sac a pawn to open the lines for your bishops} c5 20. f5 {So I saw we both wanted to push the pawns and take a bishop, I had a plan, and I dont think my oponent saw it yet or saw the flaw in his own plan, I new I would sacrafice the knight on e4} c4 {Still not taking the bait, Recalculating and it is looking beter now} 21. fxe6 {planned} cxd3 {expected} 22. exf7 {planned, now he has trouble, he could not play dxc2 due to the queen hanging, he could not play Qxf7 due to the lines that I opened with the pawns - after Qxf7 e7with a discovered check wins the queen.  But why worry when he has a free knight} Qxe4 {So the only option is grab the hanging knight - leaving me a pawn down temporarily.....} 23. e6+ {The long planned move with a double discovery on the king and rook.  } Kc6 24. Bxh8 {Getting my knight back with interest - Free stuff is always nice} Bc5+ 25. Kh1 {Not a big problem} Ne7 {I was thinking of Bf6, but after Qxe6 I would lose my best weapon - my two passed pawns after bxe7 qxe7 the pawn is  neutrulized and I would have to through everything at keeping the pawn, note he can still not take c2 as his rook will be lost} 26. Qe5 {Trying to simpligy the game} Qxe5 27. Bxe5 {accepted} Kd5 {SLight mistake - So i thought and had to trade up - rook for bishop} 28. Rxd3+ {winning another 2 pawns looked good here...., Bd4 is just a waiste of time and throughing away more material} Kxe5 29. Re1+ {The immediate exchange would cost me a pawn or give him time to play Kg6 which would give double defense to f8 - so trying to keep them in play} Kf6 30. Rxd8 {SOme more free stuff!!} Nc6 {So I am up 7 - and I started to force the exchanges - worst case I would trade two pawns for knight and bishop} 31. f8=Q+ {Forced exchange} Bxf8 32. Rxf8+ {WHen i looked at this in planning I thought Ke7 was his best move, followed by Rc8, Rc7+ e7} Kg7 {This was another mistake for him, only one move to keep my mmomentum} 33. Rf7+ {I had planned for e7 - playing on the drama} Kg8 34. e7 {As planned - he has two options face 2 rooks or a rook and queen in the endgame.  Kxe7 Rexe7 would lose quickly after Rxa7 and the Rook on f7 going to B7 and then B8 check mate.  He chose the second} Kxf7 35. e8=Q+ {Here my oponent resigned}
