1. d4 {Queens pawn, to be quite honest i am far more comfortable playing the caro-kann.} Nf6 {Pretty standard reply.} 2. c4 {Taking up space on the queen side, all pretty standard in this type of game.} g6 {I'm pretty hit or miss with the KID, although i am pretty comfortable with it.} 3. Nc3 {All standard so far.} Bg7 {Fianchetto the bishop and castle.} 4. e4 {Taking up more space, still very standard lines.} d6 {Required as i have to have some way to challenge the center.} 5. Nf3 O-O {So with my king tucked away it is time to start contesting the center, this is all pretty common in the KID.} 6. Be2 {Still in the books...} Bg4 {I'm not quite sure about the merit of this move, is Bd7 the more appropriate move? My thought process was merely development at this point...} 7. Be3 {Bolstering the center.} Nbd7 {I've seen people often play Na6 with the eventual intention of moving it to c7 but i just can't bring myself to move my Knight to a6. My intention is to continue to eye the center of the board. Thoughts?} 8. O-O {So for the most part i think this is all standard stuff. My king is safe, my pieces are developed, it is time to start to really fight for the center.} e5 {Challenges the center of the board.} 9. Rc1 {I usually encounter either dxe5 or d5.} Re8 {Bolsters the center and if he doesn't play d5, i can open a line for my rook.} 10. b4 {? I'm not too sure about this move. Yes it continues to take up queen side space but the fight really is in the center of the board right now and that doesn't contribute all too much. Also, after exd4 white is going to lose a pawn.} exd4 {Now the e4 pawn will fall.} 11. Nxd4 {However, first he initiates an exchange of bishops.} Bxe2 12. Qxe2 {So after the exchange i can win the e pawn and open up my bishop on g7.} Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Rxe4 {So i'm a pawn up and if he is not careful, his Knight could fall as well.} 14. Qf3 {However he sees it and slips away from the pin.} f5 {I didn't want to retreat my Rook, with this move i still have pressure applied on the Knight at d4. As black i'm really trying to take control of the game...} 15. Rfd1 {Protects the Knight as well as gets a rook into play.} c6 {To be honest i'm not sure why i played this move... i think my original intention was to keep bolstering the center as well as keep b7 safe should i move my rook. In retrospect i think this was simply not productive. It also creates a target at d6.} 16. Rd2 {Looking to double up on the d file and take advantage of that target at d6.} Ne5 {Centralizes the Knight and the queen is now available to cover the d6 square as of now. However, with soon to be doubled up rooks that is not enough. I also have to be slightly weary of my rook which now has limited mobility. However that is not a primary issue as of now.} 17. Qd1 {So instead of doubling rooks his queen goes back to d1. } Nf7 {I think i have become too passive. I'm not entirely sure what plan i should be following either. Thoughts?} 18. c5 {? this just allows me to advance my d pawn without any implications. It closes d file down preventing the utilization that battering ram that is the rook and queen.} d5 {So now his plan is to break open the center by advancing at the queen side. I'm anticipating d5.} 19. b5 {And sure enough it happened.} Qd7 {Adds a defender to c6. I'm also looking to double up my rooks on the e file.} 20. bxc6 {Was this premature? I Think better was a4.} bxc6 21. Qa4 {Yes it adds another attacker onto c6, however white now has to be very careful because after Re1 white will have to devote some attention to preventing the loss of his bishop.} Rae8 {If he continues with attacking c6 he will lose his bishop.} 22. Qxc6 {He temporarily evens up material but now he has problems on the e file.} Qxc6 23. Nxc6 f4 {! he can't move the bishop or he will lose by back rank mate.} 24. Rxd5 {Reclaiming some material.} fxe3 {So here i think i have a nice advantage but i do need to keep that passed pawn in check.} 25. fxe3 Ra4 {? I think better would have just been to recapture the pawn with the rook. My goal here was to protect my a pawn as well as keep multiple threats. } 26. Rd7 {adding an attacker to my a pawn.} a6 {? i really believe i was far too passive here and just gave up my advantage. I am too focused on his threats and not enough on my plan. In retrospect i would of taken at e3.} 27. Ne7+ {! Now his c pawn is looking pretty intimidating right now. The price of passive play...} Kf8 28. c6 Rxe7 {Wins his Knight but that is short lived as that pawn is about to promote.} 29. c7 Rxd7 30. c8=Q+ Rd8 {So a Knight, Rook, and Pawn in exchange for a new queen. At this point i offered a draw which my opponent accepted. Looking back i think that i still had a slight advantage, but at the time i was intimidated by His newly acquired queen on an open board. If i had a bishop pair rather than the Knight i would of been far more comfortable. Ultimately i think i played too passive and i think i shouldn't have been as intimidated at this position props to my opponent for staying in the game. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.}
