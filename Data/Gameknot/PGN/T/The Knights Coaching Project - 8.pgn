1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6 10. b3 Qf6 {Here I thought that maybe it is good to trap the black queen if it goes for the rook (a1). So I did 11. Nxe4  (I though that the game should be continued like this 11. Ne4  Qxa1 12. Nc3 and then then Queen is trapped!} 11. Nxe4 Qxf4 12. Nf2 Qe5+ {In this move however I found my mistake. Because now black queen again can go for the rook. So probably the best possible move in 11th move was 11. d4  (according to easy19).} 13. Kd1 {However, by this move (13.Kd1) again if the black queen goes for the rook (13. ... Qxa1), the white can trap it by 14. Nc3} Qd4 14. Rf1 Qxa1 {Now the black went for the rook and it can be trapped.} 15. Bf3+ Kc7 16. Nc3 {The black queen is trapped!} Nc6 17. Be2 Nd4 {The black knight, tries to attack b3 to release the queen.} 18. Bc4 {Now, if black goes with Nxb3, white can still save the position by Bxb3} a6 19. Nd3 {Start to plan an attack to the black queen by my bishop. First need to protect bishop in c1. Because I need to move my king to release the bishop from king's pin.} b5 20. Ke1 Nxc2+ 21. Kf2 bxc4 22. Bb2 {Now the black queen will be captured.} Qxf1+ 23. Kxf1 {However, the price that I paid for the queen was really high! Any comment is highly appreciated.} cxd3 24. Ne4 Rg8 25. Be5+ Kc6 26. Nc3 c4 27. bxc4 Bc5 {}
