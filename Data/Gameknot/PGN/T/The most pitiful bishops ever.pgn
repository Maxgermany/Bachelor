[Opening "Dutch, 2.Bg5 variation (A80)"]

1. d4 f5 2. Bg5 {I knew that eventually someone would play this against my Dutch. My choices are h6 or g6. Back when I played the Leningrad Dutch, G6 would be the obvious move. But I don't play that variation any longer (maybe I should brush up on it).} h6 3. Bh4 g5 {Strange position, and upi get the feeling that White's about to use a Fool's mate.} 4. e3 Nf6 5. Bg3 Nc6 6. Nc3 e6 7. Bd3 d5 8. Nf3 Bd6 {Usually, it's very bad to for Black to trade off this bishop. Usually, in this opening, we try to Bd6 before White's bishop comes out and only trade it on f4 when we get an advantage by breaking open White's pawns.} 9. Qe2 O-O 10. O-O-O {With my kingside pawns all expanded, I had a feeling he would castle queenside. But I also think I can lock Lou the pawns on that side and keep my king fairly well protected.} Bd7 11. Ne5 Be8 {I need that bishop to protect some spots around my king keep his queen away. I'm also wondering if Bh5 might help me.} 12. Kb1 Bxe5 13. dxe5 Bh5 14. f3 Nd7 15. h4 g4 16. f4 {I think these three bishops are the most pitiful bishops I've ever seen in a game.} a6 17. Qd2 {I want to retreat the bishop to e8 and use him on the other side, but I know if he moves, White's waiting to play h5 before I can and give the h4 square to his pieces.} Nc5 18. Be2 b5 {My king's feeling safe. Time to start to go aftter his.} 19. b4 Nb7 20. a3 Ne7 {My knight has to get out of the way. C5 is going to be my breakthrough move.} 21. Qe1 Qc8 22. Na2 c5 23. Qc3 {Do I want to take it and trade queens.. Or do I want to push the pawn and lock things up even more, and make it harder to get to his king.} Qc6 {How about neither. I'll trade when I'm ready to attack.} 24. Qd3 d4 {I think this is a killer move. I'm going to give up this pawn temporarily, but I control lines into his camp. My queen threatens his weak spot on g2.} 25. exd4 Rfd8 {I really don't want to open up the d-file because he controls it. He timed out here, but I like my position. I've got the initiative and,I feel, a better position. He only has a small material advantage, but my other advantages will translate into recovering that pawn and more.}
