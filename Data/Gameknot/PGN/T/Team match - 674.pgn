1. d4 {Here's a game I think's pretty exciting. Hope you enjoy it.  I joined GameKnot to especially get practice against d4, so I'm glad to get this test.} f5 {I experimented with the Leningrad Dutch maybe ten years ago in a couple of tournament games, got scared, and put it aside. Recently, I tried to give it another try, and I got a book on the Dutch (the Classical Dutch, the Leningrad, and the Stonewall). And thanks to brMichael who let me experiment with something wild, I felt comfortable enough to try it in a match. Am I crazy, or what? Will our captain shoot me for learning a defense in a match? We'll see.} 2. Nf3 Nf6 {I've always been drawn to f5 defenses for Black. They feel edgy, slightly unsound, but dangerous for White, too.} 3. e3 e6 {I made the decision to try the Classical Dutch in this game. I think I'm going to gravitate to the Leningrad, but the book recommends being familiar with all three main variations.} 4. Bd3 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. Nbd2 d6 {This is the Classical Dutch, with pawns on d6 and e6.  The Stonewall would put pawns on d5 and c6 (not fun for Black's QB, but not easy for White to break through. The Leningrad plays g6 and fianchettoes the bishop.} 7. b3 {This looked like a major mistake to me. If he fianchettoes that bishop, it won't get to participate at all on the kingside, and that's where the action is in the Dutch. } d5 {And with that in mind, I decided to switch to the Stonewall. The book I read strongly recommended that it's important in the Dutch to be able to recognize when it's time to liquidate the pawn structure and shift it to something else. If he really wants that bishop on b2, I want to lock his pawn on d4. And I felt comfortable switching to the Stonewall because I had just finished that practice game with brmichael where I played the Stonewall, tried something wild, he beat my unsound attack, but I felt I gained some intuition into the defense. (So brmichael gets an assist if I win this game!)} 8. Bb2 Ne4 {And the book also recommends that if in doubt, Ne4 is always a good move for Black. I think c6 would be the natural move here to complete the Stonewall, but he's playing passively. I figure in every game, at least one person has to be attacking, and if my opponent wants to be passive, then it must be me who should be doing the attacking. (Don't worry, he'll punch back soon enough.)  I don't remember which pawn I was planning to take back with if he captures the knight. Maybe I hadn't decided, because there's things I like about both. I like giving my rook a half-open file with fxe4. But I also like the threat of moving the pawn to f4. Yeah, I'd probably recapture with the d-pawn for that reason. But I don't think he wants to trade off that bishop for the knight, so I didn't think I'd have to face that choice, and he can't take with the knight because my pawn forks his knight & bishop.} 9. Ne5 {No real surprise there. I already knew what I'd do about that.} Nd7 10. f4 {I thought that was possible. I didn't think he'd trade knights. My bishop's pretty week, but then I can think about getting it to e8 and out to the kingside. I don't remember for sure, but I seem to remember thinking he might play Ndf3 so he could recapture with his other knight if I trade.} Nxe5 {You'd better believe I'll do that trade! He has to take back with a pawn instead of the knight. If I'd given him time to play Ndf3, he could recapture with a knight, and the only way I'd ever get rid of the knight from that outpost would be to trade off my strong bishop. The way it stands now, he'll have a pawn on e5, and the square won't be of any value for his knight.} 11. fxe5 {That was nice of him! I think I was expecting him to use the d-pawn. It gives his bishop on b2 a little more scope and keeps the kingside a little bottled up. I want to open the kingside, because I don't think his pieces, especially the bishop on b2, are well placed to defend. And they certainly don't scare me as an attacking force.} Bd7 {Maybe the bishop will go over to the kingside at some point. This also lets my QR into the game. I'm looking to bring the queen out along the h5-e8 diagonal, then bringing the bishop to g5, and looking for opportunities to play f4.} 12. Qe2 Qe8 13. c4 {I'm hoping he wants to attack on the queenside, so his pieces will stay focused that direction. Does he underestimate how strong my kingside attack can be?} c6 {I finally completed the Stonewall.} 14. Nf3 {Where's it going? Or is just defending the black squares that my bishop would like to go to?} Qg6 {You can ask me if I have a plan yet ... not really. I've described to people that I play a kind of chess that relies on serendipity. I put my pieces on good squares and then expect good things to happen. If your pieces are on better squares than your opponent, then you'll have better opportunities than he does. And I also saw a quote from Karpov a few weeks ago in a game I was showing my students. He said if you aren't sure what to do, find your piece that's on the worst square and move it to a better square. } 15. Kh1 {That encourages me. I feel like he's nervous about my attack and more worried about defending against it than he is counter-attacking anywhere.} Qh6 {Now I do have a plan. My queen's putting pressure on the e-pawn that doesn't have a pawn to defend it, and the bishop that could protect it is out of play. Oh, yeah, the threat Ng3 is mean. I win a rook or queen on the fork because his pawn is pinned and wouldn't be able to take the knight.} 16. Bxe4 {I knew that was coming eventually. That knight was just too strong sitting on e4, and no pawn could chase it away.} fxe4 {So which side would you rather have? We're even in material, and we both have the same funky pawn structure in the center with a weak e-pawn. He's attacking my d-pawn, but I don't see that he gains anything if he trades (I'd have to decide whether to give him a passed pawn by playing exd5 and keeping the c-file blocked, but I think I'd prefer to play cxd5. My bad bishop feels better than his bad bishop. Overall, I feel like I've got more initiative than he does, more opportunities to do something.} 17. Ng1 {Really? I guess he wants to keep it on the kingside -- he's conceding that I have the initiative and he can't afford to move any more pieces away from the kingside, and maybe he plans to use it to block on h3 or go to e2 and f4 after he moves the queen. The second plan worries me more because then he's attacking e6, so I don't want to give him time for that long reshuffling of pieces.} Bg5 {I told you that was a weak pawn, didn't I?} 18. Rxf8+ Rxf8 19. Re1 {I love it! His two most powerful pieces are busy protecting a pawn.   So how can I take advantage of it?} Bh4 {I like that move a lot.  For one thing, it supports a rook invasion on f2, and then after he moves the queen, the rook gets the bishop on b2. But if he plays Rf1, I can trade rooks and then the queen captures on e3. And g3 doesn't stop me, because I can just take it -- that pawn on h2 is pinned. I told you that I liked my Qh6 move; all I did was put it on a better square, and it keeps on paying dividends.} 20. Rb1 {He had to go protect that bishop, but now his rook's not participating.} Rf2 {I'm not sure what the rook will get to do down there, but I know it's better there than it is on f8. I'd really like to find a way to attack his e-pawn from behind.} 21. Qg4 Rd2 {Do you notice that, in a way, I've got like three of his pieces pinned. I already mentioned the pawn on h2, but also his bishop. If the bishop moves, I get the pawn on a2. And if the bishop's pinned, then so's the rook. Even if I don't know what all I'll do yet, I know I have more options than he does. } 22. Nh3 {I'm thinking that he's looking for a way to counterattack my pawn on e6. I've got to watch out for letting his queen can recapture there.} Bf2 {I want that pawn! I think I also looked briefly at Rd3, but I liked my rook on that row. I wish I could remember what I planned to do if he played Nxf2.} 23. Ba3 {I'm annotating the game and wondering: why didn't he take the bishop. Maybe he's thinking that his trap here is stronger than it really is. It may be that he sees that if I have a rook on the f-file, he no longer has any threats at f8. And after I take back with the rook, that pawn on e3 will still ultimately fall. Now I've got to be concerned about him getting his queen or rook to f8.} Qxe3 {I thought about it and decided I could hold off his attack. What I also like about this capture is that I have a passed pawn that's immediately part of the attack and threatening him.} 24. Rf1 Qd3 {That's kind of my sneaky move.  He can't take the bishop with the knight because Qxf1#. If he takes it with the rook and I take his rook, he can't play Nxf2 because of Qxf1#. And he can't leave the rook where it is because of Qxf1#. And if he moves the rook like to c1 or b1 or a1, I get to play e3, and that just looks like it causes all kinds of problems for him. From e3, it guards the bishop and lets my rook do other things.} 25. Rxf2 Rxf2 26. Qh4 {For the rest of the game, I've got to deal with his threats of checking me on the back row, maybe winning my bishop and picking off my queen pawns, ...} Rf1+ 27. Ng1 {So now I've got a tough decision. I'm looking at Qe3, threatening to take the knight with mate.  But I'm real worried about giving him a chance to play 28. Qd8 . Then I'm looking at 28. ... Kf7; 29. Qxd7  Kg6; 30. Qxe6 . I remember playing out scenarios where he gets the bishop to check me and can use his pawns and he would either get a checkmate or a stalemate. So, I took a deep breath and decided that whoever can give check keeps the initiative.} Rxg1+ 28. Kxg1 Qxd4+ 29. Kf1 Qd1+ 30. Kf2 Qd2+ 31. Kf1 {I'd like to find a way to check him with the pawn advance.} Qd3+ 32. Kf2 e3+ 33. Kf3 e2+ 34. Kf2 {Here's where I looked for awhile and didn't find any way to queen that pawn successfully. So I trade it for another one that causes me problems.} Qf5+ 35. Kxe2 Qxe5+ 36. Kd3 Qf5+ 37. Kd2 Qf6 {That's a move I didn't like to make. I was certain he would trade queens, and even though I'm up two pawns, I played through lots of scenarios and found that his bishop can probably hold off my two pawns because my bishop's on the opposite color. In fact, later on, I would be looking at cases where I was ahead by 3 pawns and he still would be able to hold me off with that bishop.} 38. Qg3 {Sigh of relief. He's looking at his deficit in pawns and doesn't want to trade queens. I'll remember that, and that suggests to me that he'll be reluctant to block a check with his queen. Seriously, given a choice, what I want to trade off are bishops, not queens.} Qd4+ 39. Kc2 Qe4+ 40. Kd2 e5 {This was a key position for me. I was in the Netherlands for training. I didn't get out of training and back to the hotel until about 9 or 9:30, and I ordered room service (way too expensive for way too little food), and I started analyzing this position. No family around, so why not. In fact, you'll appreciate this ... I had internet access, so I tuned in to www.kjic.org ("King Jesus is Coming", a Southern Gospel station I've been listening to since April in the car that broadcasts from south of Houston). I built a decision tree until about 1 or 1:30 in the morning looking at about two dozen lines. I was hoping for Bb2, because I'd get to play d4. If I got to that point, I could trade queens and win that endgame despite opposite color bishops. Every line I looked at won for me except for one, Qf3, because I'd have to trade queens, I felt, and then I didn't see a way to force a win in the endgame. My bishop's been patient the entire game, watching the rest of his army do the fighting, but he's going to participate when it counts!} 41. Qg5 {Thank you. I'd spent a lot of time looking at this variation, because I'd felt it was the most dangerous to me, but I had played through a lot of lines and didn't find anything that stopped me from winning. Now, I knew I could get him.} Bf5 42. Qd8+ Kf7 43. Bf8 {Wait a second, hold everything. I looked at Qe7 , Qc7 , and Qf8  at this point. I hadn't looked at Bf8. My heart jumped for a moment because of the threat of Qe7  and Qxg7 . I'd already given away an easier win, I felt, in the other game (a draw) and was suddenly afraid of blowing both of my games. I remember sending a comment to saagent that I felt if I ever stopped checking him, I was in trouble. He replied that he suspected there was probably a mate in there -- by then, I'd found it.} Qd3+ 44. Ke1 {That's his only move.} Qc3+ 45. Kf2 {He's trying to stay off white squares so I can't reposition the bishop with a check.} Qd2+ 46. Kf3 Be4+ 47. Kg4 Qf4+ 48. Kh3 Bf5+ 49. g4 Qxg4# {}
