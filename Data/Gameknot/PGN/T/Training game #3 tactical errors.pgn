[Opening "French (C00), Reversed Philidor formation"]

1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 {2....d5. The French Defense, Reversed Philidor Variation. I'm not to familiar with this line, but I don't think that I like it.} 3. Qf3 {3.Qf3? This move is strange. I think that White should develop. } Nc6 {3....Nc6 Develops, keeping tabs on e5 and d4.} 4. Nh3 {4.Nh3? White should have probably played 4.Ne2, then fianchettoed his Light Squared Bishop, since it has little future in the French center.} b6 {4....b6 I prepare for a fianchetto. This also allows Bc5, aligning the Bishops.} 5. Ng5 {5.Ng5. Ahh, so that's what he was getting at. No, White should develop instead of attacking. Two pieces is hardly a battle-ready force.} Nf6 {5...Nf6. This develops and blocks the mate threat on f6.} 6. c3 {6.c3. Preparing a d4 pawn push, which would be follows by d4, e5, and my Dark Squared Bishop would be obsolete. } g6 {6....g6. This allows me to get my Dark Squared Bishop to a more useful location than his dying future on the a3-f8 diagonal.} 7. d4 {7.d4. The aforementioned pawn push.} Bh6 {7....Bh6. This pins the Knight to the Bishop on c1.} 8. e5 {8.e5. Now White controls the dark squares. And here is my first miscalculation.} Bxg5 {8....Bxg5?? This miscalculation allows Black to win a minor piece.} 9. Bxg5 O-O {9....O-O. I cannot move the Knight, because of the pin, and I had to castle to avoid losing even more material.} 10. Bxf6 Qe8 {10....Qe8. Now everything goes downhill.} 11. Qh3 {11.Qh3. This prepares for 12.Qh6, then mate is unavoidable.} h5 {11....h5. Only option.} 12. Qe3 {12.Qe3. White is relentless. 13.Qh6 is unavoidable mate.} Kh7 {12....Kh7. Once again, the only defense.} 13. Be2 {13.Be2. Probably preparing for a sac on h5 to rip away my defense.} Na5 {13....Na5?? This is a huge blunder! I don't know what I was thinking. 13....Ne2 is obviously the correct move here. From e2, the Knight can move to f5, where it controls the h4, h6, g3, g7, e3, e7, and d6 squares. If White trades on e7, that removes a vital attacker from White's attack. } 14. Qd3 {14.Qd3. This pins the g6 pawn and allows 15.Bxh5.} Rg8 15. Bxh5 Qf8 {15...Qf8. Now that I have two defenders in the corner, I will try to hang on with everything I have.} 16. Na3 Qh6 {16....Qh6. Kicking the Bishop.} 17. Bxg6+ Rxg6 {17....Rxg6?? The second miscalculation. I should have taken with the Queen or pawn.} 18. Nb5 {18.Nb5. Plans to take on c7, it appears.} c5 19. dxc5 bxc5 20. Nd6 {20.Nd6. Attacking the helpless f-pawn.} Kg8 {20....Kg8. Defending and releasing the pin.} 21. O-O Nb7 {21....Nb7. I try to trade Knights. I think that this is better than 21...Bb7. Once the Knight takes, the Bishop retakes, then I can move the d-pawn and my Bishop will stare down g2.} 22. Nxc8 {22.Nxc8. But White has other plans. } Rxc8 23. Qa6 Rc7 24. Qxa7 {24.Qxa7. I thought this was the end of what his Queen would do. How wrong I was.} Qh3 {24....Qh3. This threatens mate, but I overlooked HIS mate threat.} 25. Qb8+ {25.Qb8. I could resign here, on account of unavoidable mate, but I decided to draw it out as long as possible.} Rc8 26. Qxc8+ Nd8 27. Qxd8+ Kh7 {27....Kh7. The only move.} 28. Qh8# {28.Qh8#  My opponent played well in this game, and I played terribly. I overlooked, miscalculated, blundered, and overall failed in the middle-late game.   Thank you for reading!
