[Opening "Philidor (C41), Boden variation"]

1. e4 {Blitz chess is more about winning economically (without super-long thinks or analysis) than about calculating variations.  It often highlights my lack of imagination in creating tactical chances for myself.  But I managed to do alright here.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's defense.  Sound, but pretty passive.  I decide to go for quick development and hope to blow open black's king's defenses in short order.} 3. d4 exd4 4. Qxd4 {The most aggressive recapture, although not necessarily better than Nxd4.  This entices black to play Nc6.} Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 {Forcing Bxc6 to justify 4. Qxd4, other options force the queen to move again.} 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. Bg5 {Trying to provoke kingside weaknesses.} Be7 {A little unexpected.  This allows white to exchange away black's advantage (the two bishops) while maintaining a lead in development.} 8. Bxe7 {A safe option, but Qxg7 was stronger.} Qxe7 {At this point, white could still play Qxg7 (I saw it at this point), but I deemed it too risky.  It looks like it wins a pawn and possibly more, but Black's retort, Qxe4 , is very strong.} 9. Nc3 {So here's a safer option now.  White still has a (very small) lead in development and space, but Black is very close to being equal.} O-O-O {Making trouble for my queen?} 10. O-O-O {And answering in kind.  We're going to have a battle in the center of the board; I'm ready for it.} Nh6 {?!  I spotted this immediately as a weak move.  It develops the knight away from where the action is.  How to capitalize?} 11. Rhe1 {Load up in the center.  Qxg7 was, again, possibly a better option, as black's knight would be in big trouble.  Missed that one, though.} b6 {Preparing a hidey-hole for the bishop?  Still overlooks Qxg7.} 12. Qc4 {As do I, although this move has the benefit of allowing e5 without fear of my queen falling under his rook's threat.} Bb7 13. e5 {A reasonable thrust into the center.  Black's queen has a revealed attack coming on her.} dxe5 {Better than d5, which gets refuted by Nxd5.} 14. Nxe5 {Rxe5 was also good and very direct, but I felt that this exerted more pressure by giving black the opportunity to blunder.} Qg5+ {Seems like a good way to avoid the revealed threat on e7...} 15. f4 {!  My only really good move of the game!  It forces the queen to an awkward square and offers the tempting diversion Qxg2, which takes the queen out of play for a move.} Qxg2 {?!  I was expecting Qf6, defending the f7 square and keeping the queen relatively centralized.} 16. Nxf7 {Black's got to do something to avoid losing the exchange.} Rxd1+ {Reasonable.} 17. Rxd1 {I think this is the best recapture here, as it cuts the king off from the center of the board.  With the pawn on f7 gone, Qe6  is a menacing idea.} Nxf7 18. Qxf7 {After all the bloodshed, am I no better than even?  Indeed.  At least I'm a little deeper into his territory than he is into mine.  Nb5 looks dangerous, too.} Rd8 {?!  And this allows a forced mate.  I'm turning it into an (easy) puzzle.  Can you find the solution?} 19. Qe6+ {(Qf5 is also worth full credit.)} Kb8 {Or Rd7 20. Qe8  with mate to follow.} 20. Rxd8+ Bc8 21. Qxc8# {Bam!  White overlooked a few good tactics, but black held his own until one small slip-up really brought the house down.  I hope I can learn to find tactics like this more often!}
