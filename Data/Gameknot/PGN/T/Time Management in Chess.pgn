[Opening "Nimzo-Indian (E20), Kmoch variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3 {It is the Saesmisch of Nimzo Indian, with a3 delayed. Ill be honest, I don't know this opening at all, since no opponent has played it against me yet. However, I will continue to play fast, and I will still get a fine game.} d5 {To prevent e4. Very obvious.} 5. a3 Be7 {The correct move. Although in the a3 variaitons, we normally take on c3, white will be able to liquidate the c4 weakness immediately.} 6. e4 dxe4 7. fxe4 e5 {Also easy to spot OTB. If black doesnt play this move, then white will do it, getting great advantage. In response to Blitzkov-White can take the pawn on e5. The problem is that after 8...Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 Ng4, black secures equality already, and perhaps is having the more comfortable game. Even if this could not be so, the move e5 for black would be almost forced, since white cannot be allowed to have that kind of domination.} 8. d5 Bc5 9. Bg5 {I believe my opponent spent about 20/30 minutes to play this move. It is a ridiculous amount of time. } Nbd7 {At this point, white had about 1:30 left, and I had just about all my time.} 10. Nf3 {Now white could possibly want to do b4, and the dark squared bishop cannot remain on the good square.} a5 11. Qa4 {My opponent took another large amount of time to play this move. It is not even that good, but the idea is scary. However, *since black did not do anything wrong, his position cannot be worse!*. That is all I needed to know to play my next move-after white plays b4, then I will think about what to do. Don't get this mixed up with the beginner player who moves without checking the opponent's response and then, when the opponent makes a winning move, then he thinks for 10 minutes. I know that I have played moves that were all principled in an opening that is not tactical, and with strategic foundation.} O-O 12. b4 Nb6 {Of course, I quickly found the right move, after 2 minutes. Now black actually secures a nice edge. *Since Black has more activity, any and all complications(like the continuation of the game) will favor him, and he will have more tactics.* My opponent had to think for very long amounts of time on his moves, since he did not know this idea. } 13. Qb5 axb4 14. Qxc5 bxc3 {Now black is up a pawn, and although it is a goner, his pieces are more active, securing his nice advantage here. Although white looks aggressive, we can see that every one of black's pieces has some purpose.} 15. Qb4 {Not the most accurate idea, moving the queen again. However, white clearly wants to prove his advanced pawns are a strength, not a weakness. Unfortunately, advancing pawns with less activity is incorrect.} h6 {We should neutralize the bishop-It is on our territory, and annoying. } 16. Bxf6 Qxf6 17. c5 {Now this move is a mistake. Black needs to get into some complications to prove it though.} Ra4 18. Qb1 Nc4 {An equally strong alternative was 18...Bg4 with also a major advantage to black. } 19. Qb3 Nb2 {By the way, my opponent is  continuing to spend large time on his moves. These moves I play need a real calculation, but since I had saved up plenty of time in the opening, I am still "ahead of schedule" in my moves and their time allowance. Black is now attacking the weak advanced white pawns.} 20. Qc2 Qf4 {Now the complications are over. If you think about it, white could have had many options the past few moves. Moves like Qb3,Qb5,Bb5,Qc2 were all possible. We had to calculate a few of these options and make sure they weren't bad.} 21. Qxc3 Rxe4+ 22. Kf2 Na4 {Black has used his activity to convert an attack. Now he has actually won material.} 23. Qc1 Rd8 24. Bd3 {By the way, white was now in a time trouble, with less than 30 minutes to save his falling position.} Rd4 25. Qxf4 Rxf4 26. g3 Rf6 27. Ke3 {My opponent burned his clock down to less than 10 minutes with this decision, which is correct. } Nxc5 28. Be4 {Trying to catch my opponent in time trouble, I make some tactical complications that lower my advantage.} Nxe4 29. Kxe4 Bf5+ 30. Kxe5 Re8+ 31. Kd4 Be4 32. Rhe1 {Of course white can pin. I thought that I had something after 32...c5+, and I wanted to make my opponent waste time calculating this line. He didn't do it obviously, since he played quickly, but luckily for him the move does not win.} c5+ 33. dxc6 e.p. Bxc6 {My opponent is on the ropes, with roughly 2/3 minutes on his clock. When there is an opponent in time trouble, feel free to make troubles to him, and create real complications.} 34. Rxe8+ Bxe8 35. Ne5 Rf2 {We should create problems for the opponent to solve. Here, white can hold with Re1, but that is not so easy to see.} 36. h3 f6 {I could have seen the opponent almost shaking, with his hand hovering over the board. It was a mere 17 seconds before he made the time control.} 37. Nd3 Rf3 38. Re1 Bb5 39. Re3 {And this is the move that loses the game at once. Before transposing into a king and pawn endgame a pawn down, you need to spend all your time on the evaluation. White had no time to do it.} Rxe3 40. Kxe3 Bxd3 41. Kxd3 Kf7 {White is now lost by force by a single tempo if his king runs to the b7 pawn. Its a long line, so I will just put out the moves 42.Kc4,Ke6,Kc5,f5,Kb6,g5,KxP,f4 and the pawn is faster. After spending about 40 minutes of his time that he just gained, he played-} 42. Kd4 Ke6 43. Ke4 {The game lasted until the checkmate, and it is clear that black is winning already. }
