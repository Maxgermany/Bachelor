1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Bf5 4. Nf3 h6 {Early. Maybe better is Nf6 or e6 with Bd6. It was some time ago...} 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 dxc4 7. Ne5 e6 {Why not b5? - I donot know.} 8. Nxc4 Bb4 {Try to castle with best developing moves.} 9. O-O Bxc3 {I think, I can hold close the position, that is why I gave up the bishoppair. And I wasnot at my best, so the knight can be very dangerous to be. I oversee sometimes.} 10. bxc3 Nbd7 11. Nd6+ {This have I oversee, too...} Kf8 12. Ba3 Kg8 13. Nxb7 Qb6 14. Nd6 Bg6 {I leave some territory for my king to breath, with the connectoin of my rooks.} 15. Nc4 Qa6 16. Qb3 Rb8 17. Bb4 c5 18. dxc5 Nxc5 19. Qa3 Qxc4 20. Bxc5 a6 {White have one pawn more - so he is better, but the pawn is isolated, so very hard to push in. Anyway, white seems to be better.} 21. e3 Be4 {Try to catch the c3 pawn after the exchange.} 22. f3 Bc6 23. e4 Kh7 24. Bd4 Nh5 25. Qc1 Rhd8 26. g4 Nf6 27. g5 {Instead of this, white could do better, if he takes my knight. After I got a bad pawnstructure, he could push h4-h5 and g5 with Re1-f4 or something.} Nh5 28. Kh1 Bb5 29. Rg1 Qc7 30. Bf1 e5 31. Be3 Bxf1 32. Rxf1 Rd3 33. Bd2 {The mistake. I win back the pawn. After gxh6 white would have time for this move, or simply for the Bxh6 move and then with Qg5.} hxg5 34. c4 f6 {Now the black bishop cannot get breath in the nearby of my king.} 35. Qc2 Rbd8 36. Rad1 Qd7 37. Rf2 Qd4 {Qh3 maybe looks good, but too little territory for 2 pieces.} 38. Kg2 Nf4+ 39. Kg3 Qd7 {It is good enough.} 40. Bxf4 {The only way to play... the first rank is weak, and the rook is over...} gxf4+ 41. Kg2 Rxd1 42. c5 Rd2 {There are certainly much better ways to win this position, but I played the last times very weak, so I donot give my opponent any chance to win.} 43. Qc4 Rxf2+ 44. Kxf2 Qd4+ 45. Qxd4 Rxd4 46. Ke2 Kh6 47. c6 Kh5 48. c7 Rc4 {White gaves up.}
