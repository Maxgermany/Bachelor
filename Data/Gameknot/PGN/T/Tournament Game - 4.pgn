[White "Brinkmann "]
[Black "Gerlach "]
[Opening "Polish (Sokolsky) opening (A00)"]

1. b4 {A modern chess master, with encyclopedic knowledge of every opening [even the unusual ones], would have no problem with this move. But Gerlach is caught off guard.} d5 {Gerlach responds by placing a Pawn in the center.} 2. Bb2 {The logical follow-up.} e6 {Guarding his advanced Pawn and opening a line for his KB.} 3. e3 {Hoping to sucker Gerlach into his pitfall.} Bxb4 {Winning a Pawn is a good move....} 4. Bxg7 {...but winning a Rook is a better one! Gerlach of course resigned.}
