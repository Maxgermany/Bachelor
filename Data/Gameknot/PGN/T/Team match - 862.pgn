[Opening "QGD (D31), semi-Slav, Noteboom variation"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 {Queens gambit declined, a solid popular opening against 1.d4} 3. Nc3 c6 {Now the game has transposed to a semi slav except both kings knights are still at home} 4. Nf3 Bb4 {4.Nf6 would transpose to the mainline of the semi slav, this move seems quite Nizmo-indian like, the bishop normally does better on d6 in the semi slav} 5. e3 {white devolps sencibly not fearing doubled c pawns as they will help control the centre and give black an open b file to work on} Nf6 6. a3 {forcing the bishop to make a desicion} Bxc3+ {the only move really else black just admits that his bishop was misplaced and gives white a free tempo} 7. bxc3 Ne4 {black starts trying to pressure the doubled pawns, but with most of his pieces on the back rank this is a bit optimistic} 8. Qc2 {not only protecting the c3 pawn but preventing 8...dxc4, which black often looks to play favourably in the semi slav} Qa5 {continuing the plan of pressuring the c pawns. it is always best to follow your plans through even if you later decide it was a bad plan as a bad plan is better than no plan at all} 9. Bb2 {i prefer this square to d2 as although the c pawn is pinned i feel it is unimportant and if the centre were ever to become open the bishop would be strongly placed on the long diagonal} Nd7 10. Bd3 {threatening the advanced knight, white now has a development advantage. also notice how bad blacks bad bishop is} Ndf6 11. O-O O-O 12. Ne5 {preparing f3, forcing the black pieces to start retreating} h6 {?! seems like a wasted move but it's difficult to suggest alternatives, prehaps 12...Nd7 forcing a pair of knights off, but i feel black stands worse after that as it just emphasizes how bad his light square bishop is} 13. f3 {forcing the blockader of the e pawn to retreat and so mobilising the central pawn mass} Nd6 14. c5 {?! i think an imediate e4 is more consistant, i had planned to play e4 if the knight went to f5 but missed that a knight on e3 forks both queen and rook} Nf5 15. Bc1 {unforunatly i need to first defend the e3 square before e4 is possible, obviously i dont want to capture the knight as that will give his light square bishop more scope} Qd8 {c7 might be a better square for the queen preparing ...b6 attacking the cramping pawns} 16. Qf2 {as the queen is no longer needed on the queenside she heads to the kingside ready for the impending opening of the position} Nd7 {forcing off the strong central knight that ties the b pawn down, but i think it is to late try that now, the attack is coming on the kingside and this just removes a defender} 17. Nxd7 Bxd7 18. e4 {the white bishops will become deadly on the adjacent diagonals} Ne7 {...dxe4 just opens the f file for the white pieces} 19. Qg3 {as the f file isn't going to open up the queen takes an alternate route } Ng6 {a surpisingly strong defencive knight} 20. e5 {this move both opens the diagonal towards the black king and entombs the light square bishop} Be8 {defends the threatened Bxg6 winning a pawn} 21. a4 {here i'm trying to clamp down on the queenside by getting a pawn to a5 as white clearly controls the kingside} Kh7 {?! walks into a pin on the g6 knight allowing the advance of the h pawn} 22. h4 Kh8 23. h5 Qh4 {? traps the knight which can only be saved at the cost of a pawn} 24. Qxh4 Nxh4 25. g4 f5 26. Bd2 {simply connecting the rooks and preparing to take advantage of the position of the knight} fxg4 27. fxg4 Bd7 {27...Nf3? 28.Be2 wins the exchange.  here white has a clear space advantage and his minor pieces are much better placed than than blacks. All this should add up to a white win.} 28. Be2 {need to prevent the knight escaping to f3} Kh7 29. a5 {? at the time i liked this move as it prevents b6 but it just reduces whites winning chances later in the game} g6 {black is still trying to save the knight} 30. Rab1 {! forcing off a pair of rooks giving white an even stronger position} Rxf1+ {the only way to aviod losing immediatly. 30...Rab8 loses to 31.Rxf8 Rxf8 32.Rxb7, 30...Rfb8 31.Rf7 , 30...Bc8 hangs the rook} 31. Rxf1 Kg7 {now white controls the only open file and his 2 bishops are far better than the two black minor pieces. } 32. Be1 g5 33. Bxh4 gxh4 {the h4 pawn is completely lost, there is no possible way to save it.} 34. Kh2 Rf8 {blacks only choice really as white will soon play Rf6 when black must trade the rooks anyway} 35. Rxf8 Kxf8 36. Kh3 {?! i think 36.a6 is stronger here, there is no rush to capture the pawn and allowing black to play a6 himself closing the queenside off completely reduces whites winning chances. one weakness can be defended, its the second weakness that wins it. this is especially true when, as here, the attacking side has a large space advantage as white can easily change fronts but blacks bishop would take 3 or 4 moves to travel from the kingside to the queenside.} Kg7 37. Kxh4 Be8 38. g5 Bf7 39. Bg4 hxg5+ {? this just ends the game quickly, 39...Bg8 or 39...a6 are far more resiliant but white wins anyway after 39...Bg8 40.Be2 a6 41.Bd3 Bf7 (41...Bh7 42.Bxh7 Kxh7 43.gxh6 Kxh6 44.Kg4 and the white king penitrates) 42.Kg4 Be8 (42...Bg8 43.Bg6 Bf7 44.gxh4 ) 43.Bc2 Bf7 44.Bf5! hxg5 (44...exf5  (not capturing the bishop allows either Bxe6 or Bg6 winning) 45.Kxf5 hxg4 46.Kxg4 and black is helpless against the two passed pawns) 45.Kxg5 exf5 46.h6  andblack can't stop the white king from penitrating.} 40. Kxg5 Bg8 41. h6+ Kf7 42. Bh5+ Ke7 43. Bg6 {black must lose his bishop and with it the game. hope you enjoyed. if you have any questions/comments or spot something i didn't feel free to message me. hope you enjoyed}
