1. d4 {Ya, watch that trapping of pieces. Tough one.} d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. f3 Bf5 5. h4 Nb4 {Kb4 - not the principled move of deploying pawns and secondary pieces (ie knights and bishops). Also, what is the plan of attack? If it's c2, it's easily defended. Knight as he did, or Bd3. If you want to move pawn to c5, make sure to do it before moving Q knight. Always ask, what can he do next? Here, all he has to do is move a3, and you retreat, losing tempo. } 6. Na3 e6 7. h5 {Advancing pawns almost always need to be blocked or threatened. Once they are in your side of the board, they are dangerous.   So when I'm playing well, in this case I stop, and ask, "What happens if that pawn advances again next turn?  a6.  1) I take it, weakening my possible castle, or weakening my pawn attack. He can then even bring his bishop to a6, and cause more weakness.  2) I leave it. Same result. It weakens everything.   Pawn structure is critical. I'll exchange a bishop or knight almost 100% of the time if it means pawns that are back to back, and can't support each other. I'll make exchanges all the time if it means a pawn gets isolated. Once it is, I muster the troops to attack that little pawn. Maybe your opponent will need to defend the lonely pawn, leaving him vulnerable elsewhere.} Nc6 8. Nb5 {Your next move could be Bd6. Blocks the take, and frees you to castle as well. This bishop block comes up often.} Rc8 9. g4 Bxg4 {I like this. Too bad the queen blocks the next capture. It weakens his pawn attack. Not optimal, and could have been avoided earlier, but the best move at this time.} 10. fxg4 Ne4 11. Bd3 Bd6 {There it is!} 12. Qf3 a6 13. Nxd6+ cxd6 14. Bxe4 dxe4 15. Qxe4 Qa5+ 16. c3 d5 17. Qd3 {Castle. Castle early is a principle of good play. There are times to wait, when aggressiveness can help win pieces, but castling early frees the rook, connects the rooks, and makes for a stronger attack in the future. Think the long game!} b5 18. Bd6 Rd8 {Excellent. Don't let that stay there.   A good pawn structure early, and some better moves earlier, would have prevented this foray.} 19. Bc5 Rb8 {And now you can't castle..... :)} 20. a3 Qa4 21. Kf2 a5 22. Bd6 b4 23. Nf3 h6 24. Bxb8 Nxb8 25. Rhc1 O-O 26. c4 dxc4 27. Rxc4 Nd7 28. b3 Qb5 29. a4 Qa6 30. Rac1 Nb6 31. Ne5 Nxc4 32.
