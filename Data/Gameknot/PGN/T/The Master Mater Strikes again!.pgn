1. d4 {Hi everyone!  I hope you enjoyed my previous annotation of The Master Mater at work.  He is at it again in this game against yours truly.  I end up exchanging bishop for knight to bust up his pawn structure.  Yes, and I also get rid of his marauding horsies.  I felt that inflicting a break up of Freddy's pawn structure would stand me in good stead in the endgame where Freddy is pretty strong.  But, although I was out of the opening, there was the middle game to play.  Boy, didn't Freddy make full use of that g file. Funny, Freddy's opponent had the g file to play with and got nowhere, in fact Freddy made use of it.  I can only say that it is because Freddy was so much better developed than NN when the g file was opened that his attack was so successful.  I kick off with d4 for a change as I do play e4 quite frequently.} Nc6 2. Nf3 d6 3. e4 {3. e4 - Freddy lets me establish a good pawn centre.} Nf6 4. Nc3 {4. Nc3 - bit like a 4knights game only there is a black pawn on d6 and not on e5.} g6 {4. ...... g6 - now it is becoming like a Pirc/Robatsch Defense.} 5. d5 Ne5 6. Nxe5 dxe5 {6. ....... dxe5 - a knight trade giving Freddy doubled pawns on the e file.} 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Bg5 {8. Bg5 - I continue to clear those decks.} a6 9. Qd2 Qd6 10. O-O {10. 0-0 - which side shall I castle on, kingside or queenside.  Black's queenside looks a little draughty so I think he will choose the kingside.  Freddy proves me wrong.  Like the game "Henry seemed as Safe as Houses" he keeps his king in the middle!  He now moves his knight to h5 and I play a double edged move which I will discuss after the bishop for knight trade.} Nh5 11. Bxh5 gxh5 {11. ...... gxh5?! - behold - Freddy's kingside pawn structure is busted.  If I can get through to the endgame then Henry will have the last laugh on Freddy gobbling up those pawns.  The thought was just too tempting.  Trouble is, it will now give Freddy's heavies a highway to heaven down the g column.  Do you the jury think the dubious symbol is fair?} 12. Rab1 h6 13. Be3 {13. Be3 - Fou Lenoir is driven back.  I choose e3 rather than h4 because my dsb will strike at a7 should Freddy choose to plonk his king there which seems more likely now that the g column is open - I would not dare to put Henry on that open g file even with a dsb for a shield.} Bd7 14. f3 {14. f3 - to prevent Bg4 and to perhaps line up Glenda and Fou Lenoir on that g1-a7 diagonal.} h4 15. h3 {15. h3 - to stop the h pawn from advancing any further.} Qg6 16. Kh1 {16. Kh1 - sss, here comes the Wicked Witch of the West!  Henry must now sidestep the pin.  I was wondering if, paradoxically, Henry would have been better off moving to f2 - but no! The witch can check on g3 and win the g2 pawn for starters, so it had to be h1 for Henry.  That castled position could become the condemned cell for me pore ole 'enry.} h5 17. Bg5 Rg8 18. Rfg1 {18. Rg1 - I eschew taking the free pawn on h4 in favour of gaining an attacking/defending tempo by moving a rook to g1.  In hindsight, I think that that rook should have gone to f2.  What do you the jury say?} Bf6 19. Bxf6 Qxf6 {19. Qxf6 - bishop trade.} 20. Qf2 {20. Qf2 - adding to the defense but Glenda has her beady eye on that a7 square should Freddy's king go Oh, Oh, Oh!} Rg6 21. Rbd1 Qg5 22. Rd2 {22. Rd2 - better to over-protect than under-protect Henry.  So where does the Joblock go wrong now? Hmf, wait and see.} Rb6 23. b3 O-O-O {23. ........ 0-0-0 - at last Freddy castles.  He means to line up another rook on the g file, in fact to triple his heavies on it.} 24. Nb1 {24. Nb1? - In retrospect I think the knight should have gone to d1 then e3 to protect g2 yet again.  At least it would have delegated the task of defending that g pawn to a lower value piece.} Rg8 25. c4 {25. c4 - I begin a pawn roll on the queenside.} Rbg6 26. Kh2 {26. Kh2?? - the move was well intentioned, Henry tries to add protection to the h3 pawn.  But Henry is not allowed to stay there.  Unfortunately there is nothing covering f4 so the witch can land there immediately giving check and pushing Henry back to h1.  Freddy said I should have played Rd1, that I am sure would have saved my neck.  I could then have pursued my queenside pawn storm.} Qf4+ 27. Kh1 Bxh3 {27. ...... Bxh3 - steals a pawn due to the pin on my rook on g1.  True the rook on g1 is twice defended, but Glenda is too high a value for this task.  The worst part of this pawn loss is that those h pawns of Freddy's suddenly become dangerous!} 28. Qf1 Bd7 29. Re2 {29. Re2 - I move the rook to the e column.  Somehow I think that c2 might have been better.  At least the rook would have been in line with the BK and I could have gathered a bit of momentum with the pawn roll I started.} Rg6g3 30. Qc1 Qf6 {30. ...... Qf6 - Freddy refuses to trade queens otherwise there would be no mating attack.} 31. Qe3 h3 32. Qa7 {32. Qa7 - Freddy has already announced mate.  Well, if you are going to get checkmated and you get a chance to play a token move, then do choose the most aggressive move.  At least this reminds Freddy that he has an opponent, even though a weak one.  Glenda threatens mate in one!} Kd8 33. Qb8+ Bc8 {33. ...... Bc8 - oh, if only that lsb was a pawn.  That would have been Qb8# and not Qb8+.  What a difference 2 symbols make!} 34. c5 {35. c5 - this is as far as my pawn roll is gonna get.  Now come the forced moves.  Hope you can bear to look!} Qh4 35. Rge1 {35. Rge1 - will make no difference to the result.  I decided to delay the mate, but somehow the most aggressive token move would have been d6.  That would have allowed mate in 1.  But now it gets really gruesome.} hxg2+ {35. ...... hxg2+ - # in 4.} 36. Kg1 {36. Kg1 - no choice here, double check.} Qh1+ {36. ..... Qh1+ - # in 3 - vicious!} 37. Kf2 {37. Kf2 (forced)} g1=Q+ {37. ....... g1/Q+ - Freddy has the pleasure of getting two queens.} 38. Rxg1 {38. Rxg1 - the crowned queen is taken but I now lose both Henry and my rook at the same time.  Freddy now plays the deadening Qxg1#.  Back again to the drawing board.} Qxg1# {}
