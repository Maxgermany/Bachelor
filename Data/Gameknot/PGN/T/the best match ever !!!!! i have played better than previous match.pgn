1. e4 {my favourite opening } c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d6 4. h3 g6 5. Ng5 e6 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. a3 a6 8. Nc3 Nge7 9. d3 O-O 10. Bg5 b5 11. Ba2 Bb7 12. Qd2 b4 {golden rule that i have learnt after losing to the junior national champion of my country.. never free the rook file .. it can be very dangerous as the opponents rook becomes free  } 13. axb4 Nxb4 {the bishop is saved thinking about a future attack and better position } 14. Bb3 d5 15. exd5 exd5 16. Bh6 Nf5 17. Bxg7 Kxg7 {mistake!!!! knight takes bishop would have been better  this move of king makes it vulnerable later } 18. O-O d4 19. Ne4 Re8 20. Rfe1 Qc7 {i feel the exchange should have been made earlier as now whitee s powers are free and easier to move than before esp the rook  } 21. Qg5 {now the kings vulnerability is exploited} Bxe4 {never free the center pawn with so uch authority and a rook acking it with your king in such a position } 22. dxe4 Nd6 23. e5 {as expected } Nf5 {not a very good option  } 24. Qf6+ Kg8 25. Ng5 {attacking the black castle } Nh6 26. Re4 {freeeing the rook you shall see this move is very crucial in this game  } c4 {a nice block } 27. Ba4 {this bishop is vital as it blocks the crucial rook doubling later on  } Re7 28. Rae1 {played with two intentions to prevent knight attack on c pawn and having a loss later and also making the center strong } Nd5 {nice move} 29. Qf3 {even better the ploy shall be seen later } Qb6 {bad move ideally knight should have moved away } 30. Rh4 {now is the crunch situation losing pieces with the white strong at center and rooks free to attack with the queen where as black queen is a mere spectator} Kg7 {one had t be lost } 31. Qxd5 {as exzpected} Rc8 {this move was good had it been capitalised on  rook d8 was better  the c and d  file pawns are dangerous } 32. Rxd4 {easy picking } Qb4 {nice move to gain the peace back } 33. Red1 {a pruposeful moe to make the queent ake the bishop so that the white queen can occupy the essential 6 file } Qxa4 34. Qd6 {white queen s in a brilliant position} Ng8 {rare alternative} 35. Rf4 {attacking wid the free rook .. black queen is again helpless instead of guarding the weak F file its stuck at a file which the white utilises to tis benefit } Rce8 {rook doubling finally } 36. Rdd4 {doubling rook for white as well as a ploy  to attck h file and create false alarm ideally black should have played Q a1 and then attacked with queen  taking pawns } h6 {icing on the cake black gives in thinking its attacking but then } 37. Rxf7+ {a sacrifice to gain a better position as you will see which eventually wins the game for white  purposely taken by the rook to  get better position coz if had taken by knight  then it would essentially get the king out only resulting in a pwn gain which could be lost by white later } Rxf7 38. Nxf7 Kxf7 {but of course get the rook into action } 39. Rf4+ Kg7 {now the move which i said earlier the dangerous central pawn moving up with all support wins the game for white } 40. e6 Re7 41. Qe5+ {game over as  if king moves back rook f7 check forcinga exchange resulting in pawn on f7 with no stopping it to become the 2 queen resulting in an eventual loss of black so black resigned  well played joop   this was better than the previous game  }
