1. g3 d5 2. Bg2 Nf6 3. b3 e5 4. Bb2 Bd6 5. Nc3 c6 6. a3 Bf5 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. O-O Bg6 {The beginning of a plan. The idea is not to lose time after e5, Ng5. Luckily, white will exchange NxB, and I would play with the semi opened h column.} 9. d3 Qc7 10. Nh4 {Here he goes!} O-O-O 11. e3 {Smelling something. It was all too clear I welcomed NxB. } Kb8 {A profylactic move to avoid pins with Bh3.} 12. Qd2 e4 {The chosen moment for opening the game. } 13. dxe4 {d4 instead closed the game, but probably in my favour. } Be5 {The key move. One of the pieces between my R and his Q is gone. Nc3 is pinned.} 14. Nxg6 {He feared something on e5. } hxg6 {...but gives me this! How to exploit it properly?} 15. f4 {Well, the price I had to pay. Only one answer: } Bxc3 {Sadly. } 16. Qxc3 {Removing the Q from the d column. Weak spot in white field: e3, the "price" for f4. My strong move: Ng4. When it can take e3 afterward. g7 is weak, but I don't care. How would you take in e4?} dxe4 {Nxe4 allowed BxN, and a pawn would have landed on e4, guarding e3. } 17. Qc4 {Forking my f7 and e5 pawns. But forgetting e3. } Qb6 {This is not a sound counterattack. He will play the B, I will block with the pawn, he will retire the B, and I have no Q attacking e3. I could be able to save both of my pawns, though. } 18. Bd4 c5 19. Bb2 Ng4 {Of course I don't care about pawns. Not in this position. If the WQ leaves, c4 threatens e3. h2 is en prise. } 20. Rae1 {? e4 is en prise. } Nxh2 {Bxe4, f5, but it doesn't favour black. I need tempoes to double R on h. } 21. Rf2 Ng4 22. Rd2 Ndf6 {Seizing an opportunity: to sac some pawn to have a Q in d, uncontested!} 23. Rxd8+ {Otherwise, RxR followed by Nxe3.} Qxd8 24. Qxc5 {A blunder. White must cover d2. } Qd2 {White has to defend with Rf1, but Nxe3 will seal its fate. } 25. Bc3 Qf2# {}
