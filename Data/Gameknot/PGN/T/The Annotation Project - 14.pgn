1. e4 {The starting position has a set list of moves..} c5 {they play out...} 2. f4 {...} d5 {...} 3. Nf3 {...} dxe4 {...} 4. Ng5 {....} Nf6 {...} 5. Bc4 {...} Bg4 {...} 6. Qxg4 {...} Nxg4 {I have no clue who would actually play this opening, but it sure seems like many opportunities for a novice (or myself) to make mistakes on either side of the board} 7. Bxf7+ {I take with the bishop as forcing the queen to move seems to set up a chance for development without necessarily exposing her} Kd7 {Black's only move...} 8. Be6+ {May as well keep pressure on and get back a knight...} Kc6 9. Bxg4 {I take the Knight} e6 {I don't really know why he wants to give me this pawn,  I don't really want it,  } 10. Nc3 {I figure it is going to be a long climb back in this game anyway, so I develop a piece} Na6 {It appears Mr. Knight wants to fork me at c2} 11. Bxe6 {WELL  this way I get a pawn back, AND provide a way to protect c3 if I have to} Qf6 {so now i guess he gets his major advantage in play attacking f4} 12. Ncxe4 {I go ahead and get a pawn, locking up my knights for right now...} Qe7 {I had expected Qxf4 but....   here we are..} 13. f5 {I support the Bishop in the middle...} Nc7 {two pieces on one.....gaurded by 2} 14. O-O {Time to play a little 'D'} h6 {obvious } 15. Nf7 {looks like time to swap some material} Nxe6 {of course...} 16. Nxh8 {this could get ugly, Knight must move now and i don't like where it is going.} Nd4 {yup, c2 is finally dead} 17. d3 {may as well get the bishop available} Nxc2 {this was the plan since the tourney began} 18. Ng6 {i get my knight back out,  maybe he will forget the queen is there....} Qd8 {I reckon not,  I will save my rook} 19. Rb1 {No he can get my pawn at d3  this could get ugly} b5 {this was interesting....} 20. Rf3 {i decide to gaurd my pawn, and maybe later be able to stack my rooks} Be7 {hmm,,  a knight for a bishop..  kind of sounds even,  but I don't 'feel' even...  my position kind of sucks.  but I ahve nothing else to do ...} 21. Nxe7+ {really,  nothing,,  i am  just wandering...} Qxe7 {no surprise..} 22. Bd2 {I need to get my pieces developed...  finally...} Nd4 {well  I can't really afford to lose this...} 23. Rf2 {i need to support f5....} Rf8 {i can support with Rf1,,,  or Ng3....  } 24. a3 {I decide to look for a break,,  i need to do something unexpected hoping he has some sort of brain fart... } Rxf5 {well  he takes with the rook...I can't say I like the swap...} 25. Bc3 {let me build some stability...} Ne2+ {well  lets see... this is weird to me...  a gift rather than a swap,  there has to be something here...} 26. Rxe2 {I am curious,  i go ahead and take,  } Qd7 {I don't see the real threat here,  i must be missing something...} 27. Rd1 {well...go ahead ans support } c4 {ok,  I can't take it..yet..} 28. Red2 {lets add some encouragement...  } Qd5 {I still don't know why he gave me the knight..} 29. Ng3 {i will keep my knight, AND, make it possible to take c4} Rg5 {ok  now what  I can't move my knight...} 30. dxc4 {I do like C4} Qxc4 {what's a girl going to do??} 31. Rd2d6+ {I am beginning to like this...} Kc5 {it is getting easy...} 32. Bb4+ {not much choice now...} Qxb4 {this should seal the deal....} 33. axb4+ {well..  I don't know where that went wrong,  the whole start of this game is weird...  yoShark resigns here...}
