1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 {It was only later that the strong continuation 5 B-KN5! was discovered.} Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Nc3 O-O 8. O-O Ne7 {Prepares ...P-Q4. White ought now to have played 9 P-K5 N-K1 10 B-KB4, securing an advantage in space.} 9. Qd2 d5 10. exd5 Nexd5 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 12. Be2 Ng4 13. Bxg4 Bxg4 14. Nb3 Qxd2 {More precise was 14... Q-B5! 15 P-QB3 QR-Q1. With the text move Black obtains only a minute advantage; for that very reason, however, its exploitation is extremely instructive.} 15. Nxd2 Rad8 {Not 15... BxP immediately because of 16 QR-N1.} 16. c3 Rfe8 17. Nb3 b6 {Black initiates maneuvers whose object is to reduce the mobility of the opposing pieces and deprive the Knight of operational bases.} 18. h3 Be6 19. Rfd1 c5 20. Bg5 f6 21. Bf4 Kf7 {Here we see a frequent feature of the working of the two Bishops: under their protection the King generally finds it easy to press towards the center; the enemy King, on the other hand, is kept back by their action.} 22. f3 g5 {If White now wishes to keep his Bishop in the center he must concede control of the Q file.} 23. Rxd8 Rxd8 24. Be3 h6 25. Re1 f5 26. f4 {If White were to allow ...P-KB5 he would be completely hemmed in. } Bf6 27. g3 a5 {Threatens 28... P-R5 29 N-B1 P-R6, shattering White's Pawn formation.} 28. Nc1 a4 29. a3 Bc4 30. Kf2 {Black has nearly immobilized the White Knight. White's position still seems solid, but Black can use his Bishops to get rid of his opponent's only well-placed piece.} gxf4 31. Bxf4 Bg5 {Threatening 32... BxB 33 PxB R-Q7 ch.} 32. Bxg5 hxg5 33. Ke3 Kf6 34. h4 {On 34 R-R1, 34... K-K4 followed by P-B5 ch and Black's Rook will gain the seventh rank.} gxh4 35. gxh4 Re8+ 36. Kf2 Rxe1 37. Kxe1 Ke5 38. Ne2 Bxe2 39. Kxe2 Kf4 {Even though White has an outside passed Pawn, Black wins because of superior King position.} 40. c4 Kg4 41. Ke3 f4+ {Not ...KxP?? 42 K-B4 winning.} 42. Ke4 f3 43. Ke3 Kg3 {White resigns, as the Pawn will become a Queen.}
