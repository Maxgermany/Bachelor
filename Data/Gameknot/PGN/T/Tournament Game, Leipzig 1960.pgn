1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3 {Book play so far.} d5 {The usual move, further pressuring the center.} 6. Nf3 {Solidifying.} Nc6 {Developing.} 7. O-O {Securing the K and unpinning.} dxc4 {Releasing the central tension.} 8. Bxc4 {Natural.} Bd6 {Preserving the B for later use.} 9. Bb5 {A curious move, since the Knight will not be pinned. Seems to lose a tempo.} e5 {Taking a swipe at the QP.} 10. Bxc6 {Conceding a minor exchange in return for doubling and isolating the Black QB pawns.} exd4 {Fischer clears out the center before finishing the piece exchange.} 11. exd4 {Natural.} bxc6 {Finishing the exchange of minor pieces.} 12. Bg5 {Pinning, and developing his last minor piece.} Re8 {Seizing the open file.} 13. Qd3 {Connecting the Rooks.} c5 {Setting a small trap...} 14. dxc5 {...which Ghitescu immediately falls into. This horrible blunder costs the game after...} Bxh2+ {...this zwischenzug. No matter how Ghitescu defends [15 KxB, 15 K-R1 or 15 NxB] Fischer plays 15... QxQ with a winning advatage in material. So Ghitescu resigns at once.}
