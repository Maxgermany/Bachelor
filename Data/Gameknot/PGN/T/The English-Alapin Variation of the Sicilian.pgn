1. e4 c5 {Team Match, I am playing black. I play the Sicilian in response to white's 1. e4.} 2. c4 Nc6 {2. c3 is the Alapin Variation, but I am not sure about 2. c4. Wikipedia says it occasionally leads to positions that resemble the English Opening (for obvious reasons) but doesn't offer the move any name or analysis. So, I'm dubiously dubbing it the English-Alapin Variation for lack of a better name (no, even though it's the title of the game, this name is just me clowning around, I don't think this is or should be the real name of this opening), at least until some commenter offers me a real name. Black responds with a natural developing move. Also, the knight on c6 covers e5 so it allows black to play Nf6 without worrying about white responding with e5.} 3. d3 g6 {Now white is looking a bit Stonewally, though usually the Stonewall has the pawns on the dark squares instead of light. Since there is a big gap in white's dark-squared center, I think an accelerated Dragon formation would suit black well.} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. a3 d6 {Black has pretty much played five the first six moves of the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense (except cxd4 which never materialized as an option). White, however, has wandered far afield of any opening reference I have to work with. He seems to have lost a little tempo, but he does have an imposing center.} 6. Be2 Nf6 7. O-O O-O 8. Nc3 Ng4 {Reopening the line of black's fianchettoed DSB and preparing to land the knight on e5.} 9. h3 Nge5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 {All the knight moves have lost black a little of his earlier tempo gains, but his knight on e5 seems well-placed unless white wishes to chase it off by pushing the pawn to f4, a move that irrevocably weakens the white castle,} 11. b4 Nxc4 {White miscalculated with 11. b4? and it will cost him a pawn. White can recapture with 12. dxc4 but then black replies with 12. ... Bxc3, an attack that was exposed when the black knight moved off of e5.} 12. Qc2 Ne5 {Back to safety.} 13. bxc5 dxc5 14. Be3 b6 {Let white's DSB "bite on granite" for a while.} 15. Rab1 Nc6 {I am out of ideas, so I'm toying with Nd4 to invite white to trade off his bishop pair.} 16. Rfd1 Bd7 {This may not have been the best move for black. It block's the queen's pressure on the center and doesn't gain any new attacking lanes for the bishop. But he had no real options. Ba6 would expose him to a possible discovered attack if white plays d4. Bb7 leaves him behind the black knight, aimed squarely at the white pawn on e4 that is defended like a rock. Be6 blocks the black pawn on e7. Everything else is instant death for the bishop. I guess black could have left him on c8 and found something else to do. I guess it was more of a time-wasting move, waiting for white to expose some weakness black can then try to exploit.} 17. Bf3 Qc8 {Preparing for black's next move. The white pawn on a3 is all alone over there with no defender. Time to put the squeeze on.} 18. Ne2 Qa6 {This move not only threatens the isolated white pawn on a3, but also puts pressure back on the white pawn at d3 and now on the white knight at e2 if white moves the d3 pawn forward. Not enough pressure to do anything with it yet, though, but at least white has to respond to defend the a3 pawn.} 19. Bc1 Rad8 {White relinquishes some control of the center and deliberately disconnects his rooks, and it's pretty clear what his next move is going to be. It seems about time for black to place a rook on the half-open d-file.} 20. Bb2 Ne5 {White challenged for the long a1-h8 diagonal, as expected. Black replies by putting more pressure on the pawn at d3. White needs to concern himself with black's 21. ... Bb5, putting 4 attackers on the d3 pawn. I am expecting that white might play 21. Nc8.} 21. Qc3 Nxf3+ {21. Qc3?? was a big blunder for white. Obviously, if black moves the knight off of e5, white can then play Qxg7#. But, white overlooked that the black knight can move with check, discovering the black bishop's attack on the white queen. Even better for black, the black knight captures a bishop as it gives check, so black gains a queen for a knight here.} 22. gxf3 Bxc3 23. Bxc3 Bxh3 {And gains a pawn. White's castle lies in ruins. Further, white's pawns at d3 and h3 are both under attack and he can only save one of them, although 24. Nf4 defends the d3 pawn and forces black to retreat his bishop, giving white time to save the a3 pawn. However, black would then drive away the white knight with 25. ... g4 and the knight is out of counterattacks so it must flee, leaving the d3 pawn to its fate.} 24. Ng3 Rxd3 {Instead, white chooses to save neither pawn, and now he has his bishop en prise at c3, and two pawns, a3 and f3 en prise as well.} 25. Be1 Qxa3 {Maintaining defense of the rook at d3 and lining up two pieces to attack f3.} 26. Rxd3 Qxd3 {26. Rxd3?? was another blunder. Not only can black ill-afford exchanges while behind by such a large material deficit, the move allows (in fact it practically requires) black to play 26. ... Qxd3 which forks white's rook on b1 and his pawn on f3. White's only way to prevent immediate checkmate (27. ... Qxf3 and 28. ... Qg2#) is to play 27. Ka2 Qxb1, 28. Kxh3 Qxf1 and white is down another whole rook, but the game goes on for a few more moves.} 27. Ra1 Qxf3 {White responded to the less immediate concern and saves his rook. Maybe he wanted a quick release from this game. After black's move, 27. ... Qxf3, white resigned.}
