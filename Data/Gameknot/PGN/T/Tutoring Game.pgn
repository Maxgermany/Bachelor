1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The Philidor Defense} 3. d4 {The most common response} Nf6 {Black can play 3 .... exd4, but, why black has to give the center so fast?} 4. Bg5 {I think this is a strange move, I have never seen it before.  I have seen 4 Nc3. If 4 dxe5, black plays Nxe4 with and aprox equal position} Nbd7 {Defending the e5-pawn} 5. dxe5 {Reducing the tension in the centre, but now we will see that the g5-bishop is not very well placed} dxe5 6. Bc4 Bc5 {Now, I do not like this move, I could have played Be7, letting the c5-square for the knight in the future (after c6, Qc7) } 7. Nbd2 {Developping the N to d2, with the idea of covering the d4-square with c3 in the future} c6 8. Bh4 b5 {Gaining space in the Q-side. I had to try something in the K-side, but with my B on c5 that is dificult (because I have to do Nc5-e6)} 9. Bd3 O-O 10. O-O Bb7 11. c3 Qc7 12. b4 {During the game, I saw this as a strange plan, but now, I know it gives white an equal position} Be7 13. Qc2 {Qb3!? trying to defend the b4-pawn, for ezample 13 Qb3 a5 14 a3 and white is ready to play c4} a5 14. a3 Rfd8 15. Rab1 axb4 {White was threatening c4} 16. axb4 Nf8 17. Bg3 {c4!?} Ng6 18. c4 Qd7 19. Be2 Nh5 20. Rfd1 {20 Nxe5?! Nxg3! 21 Nxd7 Nxe2+ 22 Kh1 Rxd7 and Black is slightly better with three pieces against a queen 20 Bxe5 Nxe5 21 Nxe5 Qxd2 22 Qxd2 Rxd2 23 Bxh5 g6 24 Bf3 Bf6 and bxc4 with some winning probabilities} Nxg3 21. hxg3 Qe8 22. c5 {Now, in this position, no one has real winning posibilities. We followed playing only by inertia} Bc8 23. Nb3 Be6 24. Na5 Rxd1+ 25. Rxd1 f6 26. Nh4 Nxh4 27. gxh4 Ra7 28. Qc3 Rd7 29. Kh2 Qc8 30. Bd3 Rd4 31. Bc2 Qd7 32. Rxd4 exd4 33. Qd3 Qc7+ {}
