1. f4 d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 Bg7 10. O-O {Ne6 is worth consideration here.} Na6 11. c3 {The idea is to block the dark squares, keep the N off c2, and then capture the e pawn. Nxe4 immediately is met by Qd4+. } h5 12. Bh3 {?? A serious blunder. As is typical in this motif, a seemingly normal move can turn bad quickly. Be2! was necessary to protect d3 and maintain the idea of capturing on e4 with the potential of a pin.} Qd3 13. Re1 Nc5 14. b4 {?? Seemingly good but tactically unsound. } Bd4+ {At this point, White should resign. Capturing the bishop loses an essential rook to check, and interposing the rook is futile. Otherwise, only one king move is possible.} 15. Kh1 Bf2 {The point.} 16. Rg1 {The only move to try and retain some material. White then resigns.}
