Nc5 {the c5 square is know under White's control.} Qa8 {a passive move,although 21...Bc8 is just as passive.} 22. Bf1 {abondoning the fianchetto andaiming for the weak a6 pawn.} Rd8 23. Bd3 {the bishop is pretty strong here because now he also has the b1-h7 diagonal.Also the queen can go to e2 forming a battery on the f1-a6 diagonal.} Kf8 {Black can only await events...} 24.
