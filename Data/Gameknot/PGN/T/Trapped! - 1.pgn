1. e4 {Hi everyone - I have had some fascination for the Ponziani opening ever since a 1200  player played it against me in my previous annotated game A Ponziani Opening.  My opponent gave me the opportunity to transpose into it - things did not work out though.} Nc6 2. Nf3 e5 3. c3 {3. c3 - this move is characteristic of the Ponziani Opening.} d5 4. Qa4 f6 5. d3 {5. d3 - fairly main-linesh!} Be6 6. Nbd2 Nge7 7. Be2 Ng6 8. b4 {8. b4? - this pawn push was made in one of the illustrative games from the database - it strikes out at the flank and allows Frere Lenoir to come out on b7 or a6.  In hindsight though I should have castled first.  It will be a long time before I have the opportunity to castle short and by then it was all too late!} Nf4 {8. ......... Nf4 - nasty, nasty, attacks g pawn and prevents castling short because my bishop will be en prise - if I play g2 then black may move his bishop to h3.  If I then exchange bishops my castled position will be very weak should I choose to put Henry on g1.  Reluctantly I put my development into reverse gear and perhaps play Bb2 next move to prepare for long castling - but .....} 9. Bf1 dxe4 10. dxe4 Nd3+ 11. Bxd3 {11. Bxd3 - forced to retain the option of castling.} Qxd3 12. Qd1 {12. Qd1 - again reverse development to prevent the Wicked Witch of the West from implanting herself on c2.} Rd8 13. Bb2 {13. Bb2 - Frere Lenoir develops at last!} Bg4 14. Qb1 Qxb1+ 15. Rxb1 Be6 16. a3 g6 17. Rd1 {17. Rd1? - maybe this was where I went wrong again - I think 0-0 was better but you the jury decide.} Bh6 18. Nb1 O-O 19. O-O {19. 0-0 - about time too but I think it is too late.} Bb3 20. Rxd8 Rxd8 21. Bc1 Bf8 22. Nfd2 Bc2 {22. ......... Bc2 - nasty, nasty, but little do I know that this will be the beginning of an entrapment for my rook on f1.  Black's bishop pair will become extremely strong as you will soon see.} 23. f3 Ne7 24. Bb2 Bh6 25. Bc1 Be3+ 26. Kh1 Bd3 27. Re1 Bf2 28. Rd1 Be2 {28. .......... Be2 - here I decide to throw in the sponge.  Although I will only be an exchange down  after Rg1, BxB, KxB black's rook is very strong and I feel I have no counterplay and my opponent has a rating of nearly 200 points north of mine.  The game was unrated so my rating was unaffected.  I hope you have had a good read.  Joanne}
