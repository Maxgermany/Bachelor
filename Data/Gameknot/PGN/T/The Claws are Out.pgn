[Black "fatcat2 (1431)"]
[Opening "QGD (D60), Orthodox defence"]

1. d4 {Revenge match, my Arch-Rival vs me.} d5 {Last time I tried 1...Nf6, and he played an irritating and boring line (how can he manage both!?) which took all the fun out of my subsequent King's Indian Defence. So this time, it's 1..d5 for me.} 2. c4 e6 {Classical Queen's Gambit Declined, aimed at maintaining a pawn in the centre and opening a line for Black's dark-squared bishop. The oldest response to the Queen's Gambit, and 2nd most common in GameKnot's database (after 2...c6, the Slav Defence).} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 {Tartakower Variation, releasing the pin on Black's knight. Otherwise, all main line QGD.} 5. e3 {Lasker Variation, opening up a line to develop White's other bishop. 2nd most common in GameKnot database, after main line 5.Nf3.} O-O 6. Nf3 Nbd7 {Adding some more backup on the f6-knight. Black's light-squared bishop will be fianchettoed.} 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Bxe7 Qxe7 9. Bd3 Nxc3 10. bxc3 b6 11. Be4 Rb8 12. Qc2 Nf6 {Black's position is solid, and ready for anything White might throw at it. White doesn't bother.} 13. Bd3 Bb7 14. Be2 {He offered a draw. I accepted. Why? Well, it looked like an equal position to me, and the draw made my rating go +4.5 and his -30.5! What do you think, people? Is this position equal?}
