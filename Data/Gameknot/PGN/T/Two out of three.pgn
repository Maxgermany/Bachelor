1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bf4 Bd6 4. e3 Nf6 5. Bd3 c5 6. c3 Qb6 {My first aggressive developmental move, attacking White's weak b2 Pawn.  Must remember that my Queen is my only support for my Bishop on d6.} 7. Qb3 {White aggressively defends b2.} Bd7 {I'm usually more aggressive (as in QxQ), but I'm trying to learn patience and development.} 8. Bxd6 {Red flag!  A move this aggressive from a worthy opponent screams "Reality Check!"  Hmm... I failed to notice that while my Queen was protected my Bishop on d6, she is also protecting my weak Pawn on b7...  If I capture his Bishop with my Queen, he could snag b7 and threaten my Rook...} Qxd6 {But if he does, Bc6 would force White's Queen back to b3, where c4 would give me a fork that should win me his Bishop!  I should think my esteemed opponent sees this, and will play Ne5, or the more volatile Bb5...} 9. dxc5 {Or maybe he'll attack my Queen...} Qxc5 {He can now capture my b7 pawn for free, but I'd rather the imbalance than a White pawn on c5.} 10. O-O {Surprised me again...   } b6 {CMA} 11. a4 {White blocks my Bishop.  Maybe I should castle now and develop my Knight later?} Nc6 {On second thought, I'd rather protect e5 from White's Knight...} 12. Nbd2 {White's position looks slightly more defensive than mine as I'm more advanced in the center, but he has a lot of fire power on that front.  I'm thinking e5 would press my center control, but I probably should castle...} e5 {But what the hell, e6 is a viable fork...} 13. Bb5 {Was a viable fork...  I really should castle, but White has nothing to do next move but attack, and I don't like the lines I've analyzed, so...} Na5 {I'll press White's Queen instead, and hope I can castle next move...} 14. Qa3 {If I start a trade fest, we'll each end up with a Knight and two Rooks to support the pawn races, but my King's Black arse would still be in the open during the exchange....} O-O {So I'll tuck him into bed, and toss the ball to White...} 15. Nxe5 {Oops!  didn't mean to toss him that Pawn...  Maybe I can even the score...} Bxb5 {Had to attack to defend, as Black had two pieces focused on d7 to my one...} 16. axb5 {OK.  I can pop his pawn with my Queen.  } Qxb5 {And now material is even and Whites Queen is kinda stuck.} 17. Nef3 {I think White's Knight will attack my Queen from d4.  I could Nc4, attacking White's Queen, but I don't like the lines I've worked out.} Nc6 {Better I think to defend d4.  A Knight trade there would force White to break his picket with the recapture, most likely Queen-side.} 18. Nb3 {Good move.  White boxes in my Queen, and has superior position with his Rook and Queen ram.} Ne4 {I toyed with doing something creative with my Queen or Rooks, but this feels solid.  Gotta watch White's Queen on the f8-a3 diagonal...  My weakest point looks to be my Knight on c6...} 19. Rfd1 {I don't see any immediate threat here, but I hate babysitting a Pawn with my Queen...} Qe2 {So I will start an unsustainable attack, and..} 20. Rdf1 {We get a withdrawal.} g6 {Covers f5.  White Knights not welcome!} 21. Nbd4 {I could move my Queen to c4, avoiding capture and protecting my Knight on c6, but I think we have too many Knights on this board.} Nxd4 22. Nxd4 {Best option.} Qc4 {I kinda wanted her on the Kingside of White's picket, but White's Knight to c6 would be hard to repel...} 23. Rad1 {Sets up a reveled attack on d5...} a5 {I can't find any move I like, and this looks safe enough...} 24. f3 Nc5 25. Kh1 {I'm surprised White isn't pushing his Pawns.} b5 {I considered playing Qa4 and force a Queen trade, but decided to push my Pawns instead.  I could still force a trade later if I like, unless he attacks with b3...} 26. Nxb5 {? What ?  If it looks like a blunder it probably isn't, But this sure looks like a free Knight to me...  Maybe Harry is tired.} Qxb5 {I always fear a trap, but Harry's rating has dropped quite a bit of late, maybe he plans Rxd5, pinning my Knight to my Queen....} 27. Rxd5 {Excitement is as excitement does...  White is looking to snag my Knight and achieve a superior position, but He didn't notice that I can simply} Qxf1# {And Belgium falls!}
