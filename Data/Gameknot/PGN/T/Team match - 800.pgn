1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 {A very common line of the French Defence, which is an opening I really struggle with as white.} b6 7. Nf3 Ne7 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bd3 c4 10. Be2 O-O 11. Bg5 {The idea here was to launch a big Kingside attack, with a kingside castle followed by advancing the f pawn.} Nbc6 12. O-O a5 13. h3 {The game has now become a race on each side, with the advantage going to whoever can break down the opponent defence fastest.} Qb8 14. Nh2 Nc8 15. f4 b5 16. Bg4 {I was confident that this looked better for white at this point. I had totally missed most of black's counterplay on the Queenside, but I would be interested to know if black already had the upper hand here.} b4 17. f5 Nc8a7 18. f6 {With hindsight, I think fxe6 would have been better, and opening up the f file to bring the black Queen away from the defence of the b4 pawn.} g6 19. h4 {Hoping to get in h5 and make a hole somewhere in the black defences.} Nb5 20. cxb4 axb4 21. axb4 Rxa1 22. Qxa1 Nbxd4 {Material is even here, but black is likely to gain the b4 pawn and has already gained a much better position. White simply cannot break down the kingside quickly enough any more.} 23. Qc3 Nf5 24. h5 Qb6+ 25. Kh1 Nxb4 {I had completely missed the checkmate trap at this stage, and had not seen the Queen's influence on the a7-g1 diagonal.} 26. hxg6 {Rf3 would be helpful both for defence and to use in any possible kingside attacks later. Nf1 may be needed to prevent black from getting all of their forces down the queenside.} Nd3 27. gxh7+ Kh8 28. cxd3 Ng3# {As I said, I'd simply missed the checkmate. Great play by black to exploit my kingside weaknesses, and a thoroughly deserved checkmate. I think 18. f6 was my big mistake in this game.  Annotation for team benefit, apologies for any mistakes!}
