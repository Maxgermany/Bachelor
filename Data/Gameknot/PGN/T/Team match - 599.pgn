1. e4 {This a good game with a lot of threats from both sides, most of them not obvious.} e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. d3 Bc5 5. f4 exf4 6. Bxf4 d6 7. Nf3 Ng4 8. Ng5 O-O 9. h3 Qf6 {The black bishop was preventing his castling, so Qxf4 was quite a big threat} 10. Nd5 Qg6 {However since the bishop could easily be defend with a counter attack that was a mistake} 11. hxg4 h6 12. Nxf7 Rxf7 13. Nxc7 Rb8 14. Ne8 {A rather strange move.} Bxg4 15. Bxf7+ Kxf7 16. Nxd6+ Bxd6 17. Qd2 {White was perhaps trying to castle queens side but Rf1 was a better move} Rf8 18. Bxh6 {This was intent at getting the rook at f8 but this move was poorly calculated} Bg3+ {Forcing the king to be in line with the rook} 19. Kf1 Kg8+ {only one place to run} 20. Kg1 Bf2+ {The only move was Qxf3 because h2 was leading to mate. And people don't like to play without a queen}
