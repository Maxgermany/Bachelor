1. e4 e5 2. h4 Nc6 3. g4 {Risky to open up the kingside so early; 3. Nc3 is the normal continuation. } Bc5 {Controlling the center at once with 3...d5 is better.} 4. Qf3 {Another risky move. 4. Nc3 is better.} Nd4 5. Qc3 b6 6. f3 Ne7 7. Ne2 O-O 8. Nxd4 Bxd4 9. Qb3 c6 10. c3 Bc5 11. a4 d5 12. exd5 Nxd5 13. c4 Nb4 14. Ra2 {Oh boy......White is obviously trying to rid the powerfully posted knight with a bad exchange sacrifice, but he is doing himself little favors. If 14. Kd1, e4 15. Qc3 Re8, Black does have a dangerous attack, but White can defend himself with ease and avoid any complications.} Qf6 {Black did not wish to take the rook at this point, and has other ideas in mind. Actually, the knight becomes very useful later on, as we soon shall see.} 15. Rh3 {Still keeping the rook attacked is even worse, Black now develops a vicious attack. 15. Ra3 is better, then 15...e4 is dangerous, but White can breathe easier.} Bxg4 {Now, 16. fxg4?? will lead suddenly to 16...Qf2+ 17. Kd1 Qxf1#....} 16. Ke2 {Black's job becomes exponentially easier; 16. Rg3, attacking the dangerous bishop gives White better defensive chances. Now White loses his rook.} Bxh3 17. Bxh3 e4 {Merely threatens to win a piece, but there is more to it than that....} 18. Bg4 exf3+ 19. Bxf3 Rfe8+ 20. Kd1 Qxh4 21. Bxc6 {My opponent obviously missed my next move, or had anticipated it and knew that mate could only be avoided by sacrificing the queen. Effectively spells the end.} Qe1# {}
