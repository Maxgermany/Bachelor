1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. Nf3 Qc7 6. d4 Bf5 {All completely standard so far (for me).} 7. Bg5 {First original move, out of my personal database. It is interesting. f6 cames to mind inmediately, but black has to do ready for safe castling before he can play this. } Nd7 {As always, the correct move here is d5 by white, preventing my castling. But...} 8. Bh4 {Threatening to press against the g3 diag. } f6 {So I made a very risky move, just to see if the idea of blocking white's dsb's action will succeed. } 9. Bg3 e5 10. dxe5 fxe5 11. O-O O-O-O {The pawn holds for now, and my developement moves seem to support it easily. } 12. Qc1 {Probably thinking in Qg5, or just to take away the queen from the discovered. It gives me a tempo but a potential threat on the d column.} h6 {I know people tend to criticize such moves, but Be7 seemed to me too passive (my dsb belongs to d6 or c5), and a knight move would have allowed Qg5, with annoying pressure on e5 ans g7. So IMO this phrophylactic move is dued.} 13. Bc4 {A tempo white has to lose if he wants to pressure with the rooks on the center. } Ngf6 14. Re1 Bd6 {That's it. I could have tried to free the queen from the pin sooner, but I "used" the defence of the e pawn as a way to fully develop. Now the position seems roughly equal to me. Once released the pin on the queen, d4 becomes a sort o threat, but it is useless. } 15. Bd3 g6 {I know I couldn't have pushed the pawn to e4, but this way if he takes the bishop he makes me a present: the g column. } 16. Ne4 {The dsb seems such a good piece for black that one's instinct is to protect it, but chess is not made of sentimentalism. } Nxe4 {I would have left this knight for h5, but I calculate the other knight would go there. } 17. Bxe4 Nf6 {Again, BxB is good for me, so why lose this chance?} 18. Bxf5+ gxf5 {Juicy pawns in front of two minor pieces... chuckle, I have to be accurate exploiting them.} 19. h3 {I missed the obvious Ne4 because the bishop is somewhat safe on h4. } Rdg8 {Not Rh because of Qxh3, and I am not still ready to cope with this, even if it frees my columns against the white king. } 20. c4 {Very nice. Now my dominion on the black diagonal is compromised, unless I go c5. Probably the wise choice, but for b4!, and white gets open columns over my king, that could be annoying. } Nh5 {Not Ne4 because of Rxe4, fxR, c5, exN?, cxBd6, Qd7! (if Qxd6, Bxe4, forking Q and Rook), Bxe4 could have compensate white for the exchange. } 21. Bh2 f4 {Bad move, since it allows c5. True is that e is no longer a problem, while 21... e4 would have exchanged pieces (22. BxB, QxB, Nh4) with c5 to come - nothing terrible, but...} 22. c5 Qg7 {A trick I found. I would be proud telling you the story I foresee it in advance. It was a blitz, 3/10, you know...} 23. g3 fxg3 {Still a mate threat if white takes my bishop. } 24. fxg3 Nxg3 {Still a mate (or at least recovering the piece) threat. } 25. Kf2 {Nh1+, RxN, Qg2+ was tempting, but I couldn't see a clear win. } e4 26. cxd6 exf3 {The white king better doesn't take the pawn, since it opens the way for my rook(s) to check. } 27. Qf4 {Rf8 sounds good, but I have to cope with d7+. Qxb2+ was also very tempting. } Nh1+ {...but I liked the knight sac. If RxN, Qg2+, supporting the pawn and being able to go to e7 should have won. Maybe I was wrong. } 28. Ke3 {Surprise! It is hard to find the right continuation, with no time. } Rge8+ 29. Kd3 Nf2+ 30. Kc2 {Re2+, RxR was not good for me, so I had to go on with checks and see if something appears. } Qg6+ 31. Kb3 Qg8+ {Probable the worst blunder I had. Qd3+, and the white king is on a mating net. } 32. Ka3 Qd5 {Guarding f3 and d7. } 33. Rxe8+ Rxe8 34. d7+ Kxd7 {Ok, so finally white won the black diagonal contest. Now let's see how to neutralize it. } 35. Qc7+ Ke6 36. Re1+ Ne4 {It holds, for a miracle. } 37. Rxe4+ {!? interesting, but white doesn't get much for it. } Qxe4 38. Qd6+ Kf5 39. Qd7+ Re6 {The situation is controlled, I won.} 40. Qh7+ Rg6 41. Qf7+ Kg5 42. h4+ Kxh4 {No hope for white, but he played very well the middlegame.}
