1. e4 {This game was a battle.  I had to use all of my chess knowledge to beat this fine opponent.  It was also a team match and I played stronger to not let my team down.  I opened with the Sicilian which is my favorite opening for black.} c5 2. Nf3 e6 {I wanted to open with the familiar d6 but I wanted to throw my opponent off just a bit.} 3. Bc4 {My opponent surprised me as I was expecting the typical 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4} Nc6 {In the Sicilian it is typical to bring the c-knight out first to control d4} 4. Nc3 {He foregoes castling to develop his c-knight.} Nf6 {I develop a second knight and am not worried about 5. e5 because Ng4 wins the pawn.} 5. d4 {White is attempting to control d5 so I counter with cxd4} cxd4 6. Nxd4 d6 {It took me a long time to understand why the small center is important in the Sicilian.  6..d6 prevents 7.Bf4 allowing me to keep control of e5} 7. Nxc6 {White takes my knight moving it twice before castling.  I still have good pawn structure when I take back even though the c6 pawn is undefended.} bxc6 8. Bg5 Be7 {unpinning the knight and preparing for kingside castling} 9. f4 {notice that white compromises his kingside pawn structure for a fruitless attack.  He wants 10. e5 dxe5 11.Qxd8+ Kxd8 so I cant castle.  I ignore his subtle threat and castle} O-O 10. Qf3 {Whites plan is to castle queenside and pawn storm my castled position.  He is also indirectly attacking my undefended c6 pawn on the next move.} Bb7 {I now protect the c6 pawn with my bishop and I dont have to worry about 11.e5} 11. O-O-O {As expected white castles queenside} Ne8 {11..Ne8?  A risky move on my part but the plan was to keep d6 defended and force an exchange of dark squared bishops.} 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 13. Qh3 {White immediately goes to attacking my castled position.  Notice my knight is not on its ideal square of f6} h6 {H6 was probably a mistake.  Better was a5 attacking his castled position.  Now white is going to shred my kingside position with g4!} 14. g4 Kh8 {14..Kh8?  15. g4! Kh7 but this did not happen as white goes in for the kill with Bd3!} 15. Bd3 e5 {Im fighting for my life here as I try to block the d3- h7 diagonal.} 16. g5 {16. g5! Now I have to place my king on the aforementioned diagonal because 17.gxh6 gxh6  18. Qxh6+ Kg8} Kh7 {Now white has the ability to place a rook on the half open g file, I should have lost this game handily to a stronger player.} 17. f5 {White is increasing the pressure} f6 {f6 was a mistake because of g6+!} 18. gxf6 {gxf6? My defensive position has improved a little.} Rxf6 {I took with my rook instead of my queen because I wanted to get my queen on his kingside.} 19. Qg4 {My pawn is defended twice from the queen and the knight and his bishop is blocked at d3} a5 {This was a little late as I mentioned earlier.} 20. Qg2 {I dont know why he moved his queen here.  It seemed like a good square, that is g4} Qf7 {Im not sure what I accomplished with this move.} 21. b3 {Well I know i put my Queen under attack so I try to exchange Queens on the next couple of moves to take away some of the heat on my kingside.} Qh5 22. Be2 {White is aimlessly attacking the lady} Qg5+ {Forcing the exchange of Queens which was part of my plan.} 23. Qxg5 hxg5 24. h4 {24. h4!  the attack is still on.  I decide to rid myself of the pawn and find a safe place for my king after the check} gxh4 25. Rxh4+ Kg8 {The only place for my king} 26. Rdh1 {26. Rdh1 Kf7 27. Bh5+ Ke7 and white is better but instead he chose 27. Bc4+ Ke7} Kf7 27. Bc4+ Ke7 28. Na4 {Right now im not worried about the threat 29. Nb6 as I try to win the pawn on f5.  Notice the fact that my g7 pawn is only defended once.} d5 29. exd5 cxd5 30. Bb5 Rxf5 {I accomplished my objective but the defender which is my knight is defending g7.  White will want to take my knight and attack my g7 pawn with one of his rooks.} 31. Rh4h7 {Precisely as I predicted.} Rf7 32. Rg1 {32. Rg1!  But I can defend that pawn again with 32..Kf6!!} Kf6 33. Be2 Nd6 34. Nc5 {If 35. Rf1 Nf5 36. Bg4 Bc8  My bishop on b7 is defended twice} e4 {This move served the dual purpose of advancing my pawn and to block Bd3} 35. Bh5 Re7 {Getting my rook behind the advancing pawn  The computer will not let me annotate further for some reason.}
