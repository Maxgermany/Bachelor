1. Nf3 {My usual setup.} d5 2. e3 Nc6 3. d3 e5 4. d4 Bg4 5. Be2 Nf6 6. dxe5 Bxf3 7. Bxf3 {I don't mind sacrificing knights for bishops.} Nxe5 8. Be2 c6 9. Qd4 Bd6 10. f4 c5 11. Qa4+ {And I thought for sure that this was a good thing, too.} Nc6 12. Nc3 a6 13. Bf3 b5 14. Qa3 {I} c4 15. b3 Bxa3 {I did not see that coming at all.  He trapped my queen.} 16. Bxa3 b4 17. Bb2 bxc3 18. Ba3 Na5 19. b4 Nc6 20. Rb1 {I thought that I was done by this point, but my oppenent kept telling me that I have a chance; that I should use my bishops.} Rb8 21. O-O d4 22. Rbd1 Qe7 23. Bxc6+ {There's a bishop use, plus I put him in check right there.} Kd8 24. b5 Ng4 25. Bxe7+ {Now I'm up on top with my "bishop" and I put him in check, too.} Kxe7 26. Rfe1 axb5 27. exd4+ Kd6 28. d5 Nh6 29. Re3 Ng4 30. Rxc3 Rb6 31. Ra1 Kc5 32. a4 b4 {I had to really think throughout the whole entire game because this is a really good player.  I can't afford to make any mistakes.} 33. Rg3 h5 34. a5 Ra6 35. Bb7 Rf6 36. a6 {I have his rook and king pinned if he tries to take out any of my pieces.} Rb6 37. Ra5+ Kd4 38. h3 Ne3 39. Rxg7 Nxc2 40. Rxf7 b3 {Then I wanted to get all his pieces out so he couldn't use them later.} 41. a7 {It's a race to the queenhood.} b2 42. a8=Q b1=Q+ 43. Kh2 Rxa8 44. Bxa8 {I didn't lose much, because at least I got his rook out.  That was my goal right there.  In some cases, you have to be a power house.} Ne3 45. Rh7 h4 46. Rxh4 {Take that stupid pawn out of there.} Qg6 47. f5+ {check for the king and the queen.  He's gotta do it.} Qg4 48. Rxg4+ Nxg4+ {He took out my rook, but I took out his queen and his knight at the same time.} 49. hxg4 Ke3 50. g5 Kf2 51. f6 Rb8 52. Kh3 {The rook can't get my bishop, or else his rook will be captured.} Rh8+ 53. Kg4 {Oh, aren't you Mr. Tuff Guy.} c3 54. Ra2+ Ke3 55. g6 Re8 56. f7 Re4+ {This is a battle right here, but I will eventually get my pawn up to the top.  I know I will.  I know I will.} 57. Kf5 Rf4+ 58. Ke5 {That was a wasted move, Matthew.  Why the heck did I do that?} Re4+ 59. Kd6 Rf4 60. Rc2 Rf6+ 61. Ke7 Rf2 62. f8=Q {Do it.  I dare you.} Rxc2 63. Qf3+ {Oooohhhh.  CHECK!!} Kd2 64. d6 Rb2 65. Be4 c2 66. Bxc2 {I wasn't going to take any chances.} Rb7+ 67. Qxb7 {You could tell that he didn't see that.  I didn't see that myself.  That's why you have to look at the whole entire board before making any move.} Kc1 {I don't know why he didn't take out my bishop.} 68. d7 Kxc2 {There we go, but now it's too late because...} 69. d8=R {This.  I actually don't know why it turned into a rook.  I wanted it to be a queen, but hey, it will still get the job done.} Kc1 70. Qc7+ Kb2 71. Rb8+ Ka2 {Sorry.  Good game.  You really are a good player.  Just don't play when you are drunk next time.} 72. Qa7# {This honestly was actually one of my first team wins.  I don't have very many team wins right now.  I'm probably at like -13 right now?  I don't know.  Thank you for watching this annotation.  It was very kind of you.  Drop me a message sometime.  -Number1thespian (Matthew W. Martin)}
