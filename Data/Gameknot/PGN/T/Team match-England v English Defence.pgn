1. d4 {In this game I want you to play through it, and at the end work out why I resigned. Message me with your thoughts!} Nf6 {Played to stop e4} 2. c4 {The standard reply} g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {This opening is called the King's Indian defence. Black allows White to set up a big centre} 4. e4 d6 {To stop e5. Fischer actually once played 0-0 here and won easily, showing that 5.e5 is not really a threat, but d6 is still played, more often than 0-0} 5. f3 {And this is the Samisch variation. I want to play Be3 without having to worry about Black attacking my bishop with Ng4} O-O 6. Be3 e5 {Black starts to counter-attack the White centre, while the White king is still uncastled } 7. d5 {So White closes the centre to stop any risk of his king becoming exposed} Na6 8. Qd2 Nc5 9. Nge2 Re8 {Often, instead Black plays a5 to keep the knight at c5} 10. b4 {So I try to take advantage of Black's move order} Ncd7 11. a3 {And now I want to keep my pawn on b4. If it is forced to advance to b5 then his knight can return to c5} a5 12. Qb2 Nh5 {This is a standard move round about here, in the King's Indian Defence} 13. g3 {Played to stop the queen check on h4} Nb6 {Nb6 of course hits c4 so I defend the pawn by moving the knight, so that Bf1 protests the pawn} 14. Nc1 Qf6 {Threat Qxf3. If Ke2 or Bg2, then pawn c4 falls. I didn't like the look of Kf2 Bg4 and if I add further protection to f3 by Be2 or Qe2 then Black can take on c4. Desperate measures are called for! I didn't like giving up my good bishop on e3 (it is good as most of my pawns are on white squares, so it can weave in and out of them, while my bishop on f1 is bad as it is blocked by my pawns on white squares} 15. Bxb6 axb4 {Now if he takes on f3 I have Bg2} 16. Nb5 cxb6 17. Bg2 bxa3 18. Rxa3 Rxa3 19. Qxa3 {Although I am a pawn down his queen side pawns are weak. I'd say the position is about level. My bishop is bad, but queen and Nb5 are on good squares} Bh6 20. O-O Rd8 21. Re1 {Played to stop Be3} Bd2 22. Re2 Bxc1 23. Qxc1 Bd7 24. Qe3 Ra8 25. Qxb6 Ra1+ 26. Kf2 {Now I was threatening to go a pawn up and was expecting Bxb5, but instead he hits me with a most unexpected move} Nf4 {I should have left the knight and just moved my rook. I looked at 27.gxf4, Qh4  28.Ke3 and spent quite a time looking at Qxf4  and Qxh2 and couldn't see any advantage for Black, indeed I seemed to be winning. I looked briefly at exf4. I realised that exf4 would carry a threat with it, but I had several replies} 27. gxf4 exf4 {But when it came to it I realised that all my replies to the threat lose. So, what was Black threatening? What two pieces could I move to meet that threat, and why don't either of them work? Message me with your answer! Partial answers would be welcome!}
