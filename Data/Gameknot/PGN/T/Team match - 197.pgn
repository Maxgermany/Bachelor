O-O-O Nbd7 {http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1296039  B90 Stellwagen - Bosboom 2004} 11. h4 b4 12. Na4 d5 {The move 12...d5? opens up the black position where white is better developed with a safe king. Black's position is not yet developed and the king is still in the center.} 13. Bh3 {This move sacrifices the e pawn in order to open up the game. I considered g5 but wanted to be able to recapture on g5 with the h pawn.} Ne5 14. g5 {future sacrifice on e6 planned by white. Just a matter of when.} Nfd7 15. f4 Nc4 16. Qe2 Nxe3 17. Qxe3 Nc5 18. g6 {It was scary to contemplate giving up the knight at this point. However, capturing on c5 seems to give black everything he wants and enables him to castle after recapturing with the bishop.} Nxa4 19. gxf7+ Kxf7 20. Bxe6+ Ke8 21. exd5 Nc5 22. Rhe1 Bd6 23. Nf5 Qc7 24. Nxd6+ Qxd6 25. Qd4 Kf8 26. f5 {with threat of f6 and captures with check on g7.}
