1. e4 {I decided to annotate this game because I thought it was interesting to be my first annotation. I hope that you'll enjoy an insight into how I play chess - while I know some chess theory, I play a large amount of my chess on instinct. This was my sixth meeting with sidsidsid in a small amount of time.  I started with 1. e4, as I do every game as white. I know more lines and tend to find more positions that I find comfortable during it.} e6 {Of the three games I played with sidsidsid as white, he started with a different opening move each time (1. ... a6, 1. ... b6 and finally 1. e6) and it definitely made my knowledge of the lines limited. I continued to attack the centre from here...} 2. d4 {... with 2. d4. A rather standard move to reply with.} b6 {Readying to fianchetto the bishop on the queen side for the third game running - I must admit, I was expecting it - even after 1. ... e6.} 3. Nf3 {Developing the knight to attack and defend the centre. I could probably have attacked more with c4 or f4, but I feel more comfortable developing my knights and bishops earlier on.} Bb7 {Expected, attacking the light-squared diagonal.} 4. Bd3 {Defending the pawn while developing another minor piece.} Nf6 {Developing the knight into a square that I'm prepared to attack with...} 5. e5 {I thought about playing Bg5 also, but it really had very little purpose other than developing the bishop. He'll either force it away with h6 or bring his bishop out to e7. So I went with attacking, not letting black settle his pieces!} Nd5 {One of the better spots for the knight to sit, but it also blocks the bishops hold on the diagonal momentarily.} 6. O-O {Taking the opportunity to get the king safe.} h6 7. c4 {After 6. ... h6, I wanted to increase the pressure on black some more so I force him to remove his knight for a second time.} Nb4 8. a3 {The knight wasn't doing much here - I could have taken the opportunity to play Nc3 and get more pieces into play. Instead, I played a3, happy to trade off his knight for my bishop. Doing so, I remove one of his two active pieces and get my queen into the ball game.} Nxd3 9. Qxd3 d6 {We'd been playing the game reasonably fast to this point... at this move, I took a fair amount of time to think about the next move I played. I tried to cover as many moves as I can, thinking about what sort of responses he would play... it didn't matter what I looked at, nothing looked suitably.  So in the end I went for a rather typical...} 10. Rd1 {...Rd1. I've done this to relieve some pressure that is being applied to the knight and pawns, as well as protect my Queen from any unsuspecting attacks later on.} Nd7 11. Nc3 g5 {This took me by surprise a bit. However, I was fairly sure he wasn't going to castle on the king side anymore and decided to start bring my troops together for a queen side attack.} 12. Ne1 g4 {At first glance, I was worried by this. Once I looked it at again, I thought this only weakened his position. I didn't have much intention of putting my knight back on f3 as I was looking towards c2-b4...} 13. f4 {... I wanted to open up some space for my king first, providing support to e5 too. Leaving the pawn on g5 would have put a halt to this. If 13.... gxf3 14. Nxc3 Bxc3 15. Qxc3 ..., this leaves my g-file open for Rg1 yet I'm happy that my king has a spot to be defended in.} dxe5 14. fxe5 {14. dxe5 ... would open up my d-file and I wasn't happy for that with the knight ready to discover with one simple hop.} Qe7 {Opening up to castle on the queen side.} 15. Nc2 {Readying my knights to jump down the queen side.  It is worth noting that I'm already disappointed with the position I have got myself into so far.} O-O-O {Castled long and put the rook in line with my queen, making my e5 pawn very weak now. I should really be moving the queen off the d-file now (Qe2, maybe?). Instead, I've absolutely forgotten about the threat.} 16. Be3 Nxe5 {A poor mistake for me to make - got to move the queen now either to e2 or f1. I chose e2 to leave my back rank open to my rooks, if necessary, and to attack the pawn on g4.} 17. Qe2 Bf3 {A very interesting move and I saw it but didn't expect white to play it. I thought, if anything, 17. ... Nf3+ would have been a better option - it provides cover for his weak pawn, while moving the white king...  If 18. gxf3??, then 18. ... gxf3 19. Qf1 Rg1+ 20. Kh1 (20. Kf2 Qh4#) f2+! If 17.... Nf3+ 18. Kf2, then black responds with Qh4+, or 18. Kf1 Nxh2. The final response to that line could have been 17. ... Nf3+ 18. Kh1 Qh4!  All lines result in heavy material loss, opening up the white king and/or checkmate.} 18. gxf3 {Honestly, this is probably not the best move available. I decide to take the bishop in an attempt to try and defend a black attack and hold an advantage. I'm disgusted with myself for getting into this position, but I've checked the lines and I'm happy that I can get my king away from immediate danger. } gxf3 {Attacking the queen with a now passed pawn, and my king is terribly open.} 19. Qf1 {I'm defending my pawn as I don't want to give black a reason to move his knight that is still en prise. I suspect he has forgotten about it in the melee of trades...} Rg8+ {20. Kf2 results in checkmate from 20. ...Qh4. So the only reply is...} 20. Kh1 {My king is trapped in a corner, and I'm in a terrible position. Given all of that, my king is relatively safe for a few moves. I start to think about creating a better defence and trade some pieces...} Rg2 21. dxe5 {I could have played Ne1 here, as my opponent later pointed out, but I didn't even consider it. I was happy to trade off knights to reduce his attacking threat now I'm a minor piece ahead.} Qh4 {Providing a direct threat of checkmate on h2. This can only be seriously defended with Bg1, but first....} 22. Rxd8+ Kxd8 23. Rd1+ {...trading rooks and bringing my rook to activity with a check.} Kc8 24. Bg1 {Forced.} Rxc2 {I expected him to finally compensate himself with the knight that I took back on move 21.} 25. Qxf3 {Relieves a lot of pressure on my position and I'm starting to look much better off now. My queen is threatening with a sneaky checkmate on a8 and requires defense... and I'm now convinced that I've turned this game around.} Kb8 {... this protects the checkmate but now the initiative is now with me!} 26. Qd3 {26. Qd3! provides me with a plethora of threats. The rook must move to be safe, and it's only safe haven is 26.... Rxb2 but leaves white to reply with 27. Qd8+ Qxd8 28. Rxd8+ Kb7 29. Rxf8.... White has forced an exchange of queens and wins another piece to go into an end game with two minor piece advantage.  I hope you enjoy this game and let me know if you find anything I've missed.}
