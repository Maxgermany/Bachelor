[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B03), exchange, Karpov variation"]

1. e4 {Knowing how my opponent would defend I set out knowing I could play this without fear of something I dislike.} Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 5. exd6 {The exchange variation. My preferred way to play against the Alkhine, I have never tried the four pawn attack and instead play the exchange variation which is a little less ambitios but good none the less. I am actually going for a specific sub variation, the one I call the weird v variation.} cxd6 {Some people play exd I dont know which is better or for that matter which I prefer my opponents to play however all my opening knowledge is for if they play this move. So I am happy to continue my book knowledge.} 6. Be3 {I'm not sure exatly what order I'm meant to play the moves for my variatoion however I do know the set up which is good enough.} g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Rc1 O-O 9. b3 {The Voronezh variation. I cant spell it without looking it up and I certaintly can't prounounce it. So I just call it the weird v variation. It delays kingside development to stop black adopting his usual game plan for the opening. It also scores very well for white.} Nc6 {I have found out since playing this that after ...Nc6!? white mainline is for white to play d4 however I didn't know that at the time.} 10. h3 {?! probably a waste of time, it was done to prevent the knight being pinned which is I think thematic in the alkhine, however I suspect the immediate Be2 was better especially as that is whats likely to be played anyway.} Bd7 11. Nf3 Rc8 {I'm still waiting for the eventual e pawn thrust which is I also think common in this version of the alkhine.} 12. Be2 f5 {threatens ...f4} 13. Qd2 Be8 14. Bh6 {To be rid of blacks strong DSB. I was also considering playing Ng5.} Nd7 {?! I dont think this was a very good move from blacks perspective, it blocks the d7 square for the LSB so that white can now trade it off. I think as white my position is alright. White seems to have a slight bind going on as well as more options to play.} 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 16. Ng5 {! Cashing in on the hole at e6. black will have to give up his other bishop.} Bf7 17. Nxf7 {This probably could have waited. instead 17.d5 comes into consideration, it keeps up the bind and leaves black with few options. and it's not like I was in a hurry to take the bishop, the only other square for it was g8.} Rxf7 18. O-O Nf6 19. Rfe1 {probably d5 was still the better option here. This has the feeling of letting black gradually get something out of his position.} e5 {Good move, I cant help but feel I have let go a bit of my good position.} 20. dxe5 dxe5 21. Qxd8 Rxd8 {I suspect I have missed some kind of oppertunity here, with all these exchanges black has managed to free up his position.} 22. Rcd1 {contesting the open file. probably I should have played f3.} Rfd7 {good move, doubling up on the only open file.} 23. g3 {?! weakning probably f3 or even RxR were better.} Nd4 {! } 24. Bf1 {?? Absoloute blunder. } Nf3+ 25. Kg2 {Maybe even Kh2 to open the g2 square for the LSB.} Nxe1+ 26. Rxe1 e4 {cramping white a bit.} 27. Na4 {aiming for some better squares.} b6 {cutting off the c5 square.} 28. c5 {counterplay. if black tries ..b5 then I can play c6 and have something going.} bxc5 29. Nxc5 Re7 {only square that stops me playing Ne6+ } 30. Bc4 {renews the threat however.} Nd5 {Of course my first insinct is to play Rd1, however that would be a blunder since it allows Nf4+ } 31. Kg1 {allows Rd1 but probably not the best move I could have made.} Nb6 {?? Black returns the favour of blundering the exchange, however this time black will get a bit of compensation in the form of a better endgame.} 32. Ne6+ Rxe6 33. Bxe6 Kf6 34. Bc4 {only move} Nxc4 35. bxc4 {so material is back to even however black definatly has the better endgame.} Rd2 {! taking over the the second rank.} 36. Rc1 {Giving up the a pawn to push the c pawn. however black does actually have enough time to stop a promotion, I didn't realise this when I played the move but then maybe there wernt many other options. a3 was an alternative though. Maybe giving up the a pawn by playing Rb1 was best.} Ke6 {Black wasn't concerned about going after my a pawn just yet. Instead he brings his king closer to the action.} 37. c5 {the theory was to push the pawn as far as possible before the king could immobalise it. } Kd7 {practially forced.} 38. c6+ {a3 was the better move here, it presents some sort of resistance.} Kc7 39. a4 {Black is going to win this, I dont think there are any ways to turn it around or even hold the draw, perhaps the viewer can shine some light on the situation and offer alternatives on how I could have played the endgame? I suspect I need to work on my endgame play if I want any hope of advancing beyond the 1000 region of rating.} Rd6 40. f4 {? a very poor move to make, I wanted black to take it so maybe f3 would have been more accurate.} Rxc6 41. Rxc6+ {?? I should have kept rooks on if I wanted any hope of drawing this game.} Kxc6 42. Kf2 Kc5 43. Ke3 Kb4 {0-1 I could see no way of holding this game so I resigned. Please comment, I suspect here many improvements I could have made throughout this game so please tell me so I can improve.}
