1. d4 {Hi again everyone!  Kenneth from Casual Group N, challenged me in the Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Welcome MT.  Ken gave me the fright of my life in my game against him as white and in that one, Henry owes his life to Ken moving the wrong rook.  In this game, Henry wasn't in such dire danger, but, despite being a pawn up, Ken made my life difficult by putting pressure on my f7 pawn with his heavy pieces and it wasn't until he lost a second pawn that I was able to start moving my queenside pawns up the board and to distract Ken's heavy pieces from f7.  In the end I was able to successfully promote a pawn and make a new queen.  Ken resigned just before Old Matey was about to descend on him.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on ......} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 c6 4. Bd3 Bg4 {4. ..... Bg4 - after a double queen pawn opening both sides get their pieces out quickly.} 5. O-O Nbd7 6. b3 e6 7. Nbd2 Bd6 8. Bb2 {8. Bb2 - and out come the dark square bishops.} Qc7 9. c3 O-O {9. ...... 0-0 and Henry tucks himself away on the kingside.} 10. Qc2 {10. Qc2 - both players are putting pressure on the respective h pawns with the B & Q - and I don't mean a British hardware store!} h6 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Nxf3 {12. Nxf3 - after both sides move their respective h pawns to the third rank, there is a B for N trade.} e5 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Nxe5 Bxe5 {14. ...... Bxe5 - at least my position looks a little less cramped with that plethora of exchanges.} 15. f4 Bd6 16. c4 dxc4 17. Bxc4 {17. Bxc4 - pawn trade.} Nd7 18. e4 {18. e4? - allows Bxf4 winning a pawn.} Bxf4 19. Qf2 Bh2+ 20. Kh1 Ne5 {20. ..... Ne5 - here I am setting a trap.  Now why is K x B a blunder here?  An obbo. test here for the Inquest Jury.} 21. Be2 Ng6 22. Bg4 Be5 23. Bxe5 Qxe5 {23. ...... Qxe5 - bishop trade.  Glenda now threatens to hoover up another pawn.} 24. Bf5 Ne7 25. Rae1 b6 {25. ...... b6 - I wanna free up my QR but I also wanna avoid the Wicked Witch of the West from turning my a7 pawn into dust, so my b pawn shuts off her glare.} 26. Qf3 Rad8 27. Qg4 Nxf5 28. Rxf5 {28. Rxf5 - all the minor pieces have been traded off, now it is all the major pieces and Kenneth's are sooooo active.  How on earth am I gonna win this from here?  Well, patience and persistence are the buzz words here.} Qe6 29. Ref1 Qc8 30. Qf4 Qd7 {30. ..... Qd7 - still Glenda is living up to her nickname.} 31. Rf3 c5 {31. ...... c5 - however, here is a little hint of what is to come later.} 32. Rd5 Qb7 33. Rxd8 Rxd8 {33. .... Rxd8 - at least with being a pawn up, the more pieces traded off the better.  At least it eases slightly the line up of white pieces on that bally f column!} 34. e5 Qd5 {34. ...... Qd5 - at least Glenda now takes up a more aggressive stance while still defending that f7 pawn.} 35. a3 Qe6 36. Rf1 {36. Rf1? - Ken overlooks the fact that his b3 pawn is hanging.  As Glenda is still controlling that vital f7 square from b3, she is able to swipe it!  Now my c pawn is a passer and will be used to decisive effect.} Qxb3 37. Qf5 Qe6 38. Qh5 {38. Qh5 - Ken elects to keep the queens on but now comes the distraction motif.  Next move, my passer is heading right towards Glendadom.} c4 39. a4 c3 {39. ..... c3 - only two squares to go!} 40. Rc1 Qc4 41. Qf5 a6 {41. ..... a6 - Ken has managed to blockade the c pawn but now I am preparing to bring up reinforcements by playing b5 next move and if Ken trades off his a pawn then I will be able to back up my c pawn with another pawn!  This really will make life a lot less onerous for Glenda!} 42. Qf3 c2 43. Kh2 Qxa4 {43. ..... Qxa4 - Glenda now snaps off the a pawn, now that only the Witch is attacking my f7 pawn.} 44. Qe2 {44. Qe2?? - this blunder not only costs Ken his rook but also allows mate in a handful of moves.} Qf4+ 45. g3 Qxc1 46. Qxa6 {46. Qxa6 - the Witch snaps off a free pawn but he is still a massive 7 material points down.  Now Glenda checks the WK to make room for my passer.} Qd2+ 47. Kh1 c1=Q+ {47. ..... c1/Q+ - My passer has made it to c1 and now Glenda2 appears.  White has only one legal move.  Qf1.  Ken does not want his queen to be taken and so resigns on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  A welcome win for yours truly but a great effort from Ken!  I will be back soon to report on another player called Jellycake who has also given me a run for my money.  Until then, watch this space.  Kind regards - Joanne}
