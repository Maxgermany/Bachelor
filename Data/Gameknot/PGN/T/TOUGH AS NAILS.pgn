1. e4 {e4 Standard opening.} e5 {e5 Standard reply.} 2. f4 {f4 Kings Gambit} Bd6 {Bd6 I don't like this move because it blocks the advance of the d-pawn.} 3. Nf3 {Nf3 White develops a knight.} h6 4. Bc4 {Bc4 White develops a second piece putting pressure on the f7 square and exerting influence in the center.} exf4 {exf4 King's Gambit Accepted.} 5. O-O {0-0 White castles to the kingside putting more pressure on the f7 square.} Bc5+ {Bc5  Black is not developing properly but has a king check here.} 6. d4 {d4 Check refuted.} Bb6 7. Bxf4 {Bxd4 White has three pieces developed now as he recaptures a pawn.} g5 {g5 Whites dark square bishop is attacked.} 8. Bd2 {Bd2 White makes a blunder here. He should have moved the bishop to g3 or maybe e3.} g4 {g4 Black continues pushing the g-pawn and forces the knight to move. Another blunder, perhaps White should have let the pawn take the knight and recapture with the queen putting more pressure on the f7 square.} 9. Ne5 Bxd4+ {Bxd4  Black capitalizes and gets a free pawn with check.} 10. Kh1 Bxe5 {Bxe5 Free knight anyone?} 11.

Rxf1 Kc8 25. f6 {f6 White advances the passed f-pawn to cause black some trouble in the back ranks.} Rh7 26. c4 Qxc4 27. a5 Nb4 28. Bxa7 Nxc2 29. Rc1 {Rc1 White tries to trap the Black knight.} Re1+ {Re1  Black forces a swap and loses some of his gained material.} 30. Rxe1 Nxe1 31. Qxe1 Qg8 32. Bf2 Kb8 33.
