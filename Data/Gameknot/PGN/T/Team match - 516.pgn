1. e4 {In Team Matches, I play very cautiously. But as you'll soon see, this was not one of my typical team matches. } c6 2. d4 g6 {Some sort of Caro-Pirc? I'm already out of theory. I usually play Alekhine Defense against e4. } 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Nf3 d6 5. Be3 Nf6 6. Qd2 {I see the castle queenside, pawn rush routine. I know the theoritical response. } O-O 7. Bh6 b5 {I start my queenside pawn rush knowing things could get dicey pretty quickly. Although early, I see his king is still in the middle. } 8. Bd3 a5 {Now he has decision to make. I'm ready either way...I think. } 9. e5 {Not sure this is the best move for dontru7} Nfd7 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. h4 {Here it comes. I have to act fast. } h5 {This stops the pawn rush for the moment. } 12. Qg5 dxe5 13. Nxe5 {Wish I could get the fork in. But it's best to trade down to parry the attack. } Nxe5 14. Qxe5+ f6 15. Qg3 Qe8 {Protects g6 and presents distant pressure on the king. } 16. Ne2 e5 17. dxe5 fxe5 18. Be4 Bf5 {Still trying to trading off attacking pieces. } 19. Bf3 Kh6 20. Qg5+ Kh7 21. O-O-O {I have problems on the 7th rank. My pieces are poorly coordinated. } Qe6 22. Ng3 Ra7 {Breaks the pin by the bishop} 23. Rhe1 Qxa2 {This was the first time I thought I might pull it out. I tried dozens of combinations but couldn't find the right one to make or win significant material. } 24. Nxf5 Rxf5 {I had no answer for Q to d8. Maybe Q to g8?} 25. Qe3 Re7 26. Qc5 {I think the rook pawn can get pushed off. } Rff7 {For some reasons I had a hard time finding this move. } 27. Qc3 b4 28. Qb3 {If he goes anywhere else, I think I have some winning material combinations. I took the queen and offered a draw. Strange game because my queen knight never moved. That's usually not a good sign. } Qxb3 {}
