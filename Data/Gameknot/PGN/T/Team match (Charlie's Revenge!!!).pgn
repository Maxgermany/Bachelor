1. e4 {I'm pretty sure everyone who plays on this site regularly is familiar with gothicgirl. She is a true warrior and fine chess talent. She is also legendary for the number of games she has played - and that is no understatement. Gothicgirl is also a fine team captain and all around good blokette:) A few days ago, abe66 contacted me - he had read many of my annotations and liked them, so he asked me to annotate this game of his vs. gothicgirl. Evidently, it was a sweet win for him because she had been getting the best of him as of late. So, without further ado, I dedicate this annotation to abe66, gothicgirl, Caissa, and the rest of you who love GameKnot. I hope you enjoy:)} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Black employs the Philador Defense. I've always thought of Philador players as a truly demented bunch:) Black locks in his dark squared bishop and commits himself to a passive game. His hope is to counter-punch at the big center that white can obtain by playing 3. d4 followed by logical development.} 3. Nc3 {!? Hmm....3. d4 or 3. Bc4 seem much stronger. I don't totally discredit this move, as it develops, but this is one of those situations where the Nb1 is best placed on c3 after c4 has been played. I mean, why retard the c pawn for no reason? Maybe marin or ion can explain the dynamics of this move better than I. It just doesn't feel right to me at this juncture.} Nf6 4. Bc4 Nc6 5. d3 h6 {? Black must really be fearful of some sort of sac on f7 or white playing Bg5. Due to white always having the opening initiative, black shouldn't squander the chance to keep up in development. Much better was Bg4 or Be7 IMHO.} 6. Be3 {White gets her last minor developed to a good square and prepares to castle. She is enjoying the superior position at this point, and is preparing to coordinate her offense.} Be7 {Down some developmental tempo, black hurries to catch up and hastens 0-0.} 7. h3 {?! There is no reason for white to fear 7...Bg4 here. My immediate thought is 7. Qd2 (preparing 0-0-0) Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. g4 Bg6 10. Nh4! and white has a strong attack. Having said that, I do agree that 7. h3 secures the g4 square into white's real estate. I guess it just depends on how aggressive you want to be:)} b6 {Consolidates c5 and gives the light squared bishop another option.} 8. Qd2 {Gothicgirl and I may be thinking the same thing here. White can now castle either way (a nice option if you can get it) and may very well be thinking of a kingside assault. Notice the firepower she has pointed that way, and since she is out-hitting d5, it just may be a good launching platform.} Bb7 {?! I didn't like this move for black. He makes a premature commitment in my opinion. With all of the ammo white has pointed at his kingside, I feel it is better to keep this bishop on a closer diagonal. I see the idea of him playing 0-0-0, but it seems to me that this move is a little slow. 8...Be3 9. BxB fxB should not be dismissed out of hand because of the doubled pawns. They would be central and black would have an early bead on the f file after 0-0.} 9. O-O-O {Not content to wait around for black to tip his hand, white castles long and prepares for kingside action.} Qd7 {OK - 0-0-0 it will be. These two players are going to be slugging it out on the kingside.} 10. Kb1 {Curious. I can only wonder what this was all about. 10. Nh4! would have been sweet, as it puts the Nf3 one step closer to the natural outpost on f5 AND hastens f4!} O-O-O {As planned, but not best right now as black's f pawn is hanging. What about 10...Na5!? which would instigate a favorable trade getting rid of whites strong light squared bishop? } 11. g4 {White doesn't take the free f pawn. Instead, she starts pushing the kingside. Good idea, but I still like the idea of playing Nh4 first.} a6 {Prevents intrusion on b5.} 12. a3 {Does gothicgirl not see the free pawn? or is she wisely creating an escape square for her Bc4 first because she sees the threat black has of Na5? I'm betting she sees it:)} Rhf8 {Black shores up the hanging f pawn. Was it the right rook? Most likely, as the other one will be useful on the d file should conflict occur on the potentially volital g5 square.} 13. Nh2 {White is anxious to play f4, but I STILL like Nh4! C'mon gothicgirl! Go for the throat!} b5 {Black makes his first truly aggressive move of the game, and threatens white's powerful light squared bishop. That's the thing about the Philador - it usually is very passive early on, but if black can weather the opening, opportunities eventually arise.} 14. Ba2 {Validating white's 12th.} Nb8 {Black just can't seem to make up his mind whether to be passive or aggressive. A natural continuation to his 13th would have been 14...b4 15. axb Nxb. Black has now weakened his position by this retreating move.} 15. f4 {! White is ready to roll. Time to rev up the action.} c5 {Black is playing a dangerous game here. Of course he wants to bring his Nb8 to c6, and he does have a strong pawn chain on the queenside, but he is opening squares around his monarch and is basically daring white to attempt an attack at some point.} 16. fxe5 {Quite an interesting choice. I would have figured gothicgirl would have simply pushed f5 and then concentrated on pushing her g and h pawns next. } dxe5 17. Rhf1 Nc6 {Getting this knight back into the game and re-establishing the threat of b4.} 18. Nd5 {White has shown great patience for many moves, and puts this knight on it's natural square.} Nxd5 {Nobody likes a stranger camped out in their backyard, so black eliminates this intruder.....} 19. Bxd5 {.....and is rewarded by another. Remember black's 10th? He had the opportunity to kill this bishop back then and opted not to. Now he will pay for that decision, as white's Bd5 is very nicely posted on a great square.} b4 {! Black doesn't panic, and goes for some space.} 20. a4 {? White panics a little. 20. axb Nxb 21. Bc4 and white still has good play. As played, white may be giving black her a pawn as a target.} Na5 {Black looks to rid himself of white's pesky light squared bishop, and eyes white's a pawn.} 21. Bxb7+ Qxb7 {?! Perhaps KxB with the idea of getting the Rd8 to c8 or B8 was stronger. } 22. b3 {Protecting the potential hole on c4.} Nc6 23. Rf5 {I liked g5 better here. White made a commitment much earlier to pushing the kingside, and seems to have forgotten about it. Of course this move allows her to double up on the f file, but I think pushing pawns would be more effective.} f6 {! Shutting down g5.} 24. Rdf1 Nd4 {Black jumps on the strong outpost with both feet.} 25. Bxd4 {While not strictly forced, leaving the opposing knight posted like that is very uncomfortable for white.} exd4 {An interesting, if not outright tough decision for black. 25...cxd and black could pounce on the c file first while maintaining the block on white's e pawn. Now white's Rf5 has a little more scope and she may be able to push her e pawn.} 26. Qf2 {Qe2 or Re1 should also be considered, as either would reinforce an e pawn push.} g6 {Repelling the intrusive rook.} 27. Rf3 Bd6 {Black sets a small trap. White may think she can win a pawn via 28. Rxf RxR 29. QxR, but black would of course win the Nh2.} 28. h4 {White doesn't fall for it and continues to push the kingside.} c4 {Black is playing a little risky. He may think d pawn is safe from capture because the enemy queen is tied down protecting her Nh2, but consider 29. Qxd BxN 30. Qxc  Kb8 31. Rxf and black has a nice attack.} 29. Re1 {Supporting the advanced e pawn, but just as importantly creating a square for the Nh2, which frees up her queen.} cxb3 {Black starts killing defenders, and the c file will now be open for business once his king can get off of it.} 30. cxb3 Be5 {Protecting two pawns, and maintaing control of the h2/b8 diagonal.} 31. Rc1+ Kb8 {Shredder 10 puts this game as dead even right now.} 32. Nf1 {It feels natural to get this knight back into play, But Qd2 would force the issue against black's kingside pawns.} Rdc8 {Nice move - black will own the c file now.} 33. Rxc8+ Qxc8 34. Qc2 {A miss-step by white that drops a pawn.} Qxg4 35. Qf2 Qe6 36. Kb2 {Protecting the b pawn.} Rc8 37. Nd2 Rc6 {Rc3! was much stronger.} 38. Nc4 {The most natural square for the white knight. } h5 {Why not g5 try to eliminate any threat of the outside pawn? Now black's g pawn is weak.} 39. Qg2 {Attacking the weakness.} Qe8 40. Qf1 {Perhaps Rf1 was better, as white's rook is currently pretty weak and not accomplishing much.} Qe6 {Black regains a strong position, as f6 is now amply protected from the threat of NxB.} 41. Rf2 Bg3 {? This move only assists white. Consider 42. Rg2, which attacks a piece that would be tough to protect and also threatens black's g pawn.} 42. Rc2 {? White missed her chance to regain material equality.} Bxh4 {? Premature.......consider 42...Qg4 43. Qg1 Qxh and black has the chance for some awesome pawn rollers.} 43. Qg1 {?? ARGH! White misses the opportunity to win a free piece. 43. Qf4 ! Ka7 44. QxB. } g5 {Black protects both his g pawn and bishop, and starts the race up the board on the kingside. } 44. Qxd4 {Gothicgirl gets something for her troubles while centralizing her queen. She now has a check threat.} Qc8 {Blocking the potential check threat.} 45. e5 {As white has strength in the center, she decides to push it. She certainly must worry about black's connected outside passers, of course, but if she can control the initiative she may just be able to force the issue down the middle. I like black better here, but he is by no means out of the woods.} f5 {Black pushes his own advantage, and plans to win the pawn race. At this point, it is not necessarily a race to promotion, but a race to the threat of promotion. If black can divert white's pieces over to the kingside to defend, he should be able to press his pawn advantage.} 46. e6 {? Blunder. 46. Re2 g4 47. Nd6 and white has much better chances.} Qxe6 {The correct capture. If 46...Rxe then 47. Nd6 QxR  48. KxQ.} 47. Qh8+ {Wins the h pawn. White is now valiantly fighting to regain the initiative.} Kc7 {? Rc8 was the far better move. 47...Rc8 48. Qxh Qf6  49. Ka2 and black maintains his initiative.} 48. Qxh5 {This is such a twisted game. Both players are having good ideas, but acting on them too prematurely. Better for white was 48. Qh7  Kb8 THEN 49. Qxh Qf6  Kb1. With the black king further removed from it's pieces, it would make an easier target to check in the future. Now, black has some tempo to force the issue.} f4 49. Qh7+ {The white rook is so incredibly passive right now. It was probably better to get him into play by the tempo gaining 49. Re2 (it would be safe from capture because it would have been protected by the white queen.)} Kd8 {? Kb8 would be an easier position to defend. Black has the wonderful threat of pushing the kingside, but is allowing white too many check threats. Better to just suck it up, waste a move if needed to secure his king, and then let the fireworks start by pushing the kingside.} 50. Qb7 {? White is losing touch with reality (sorry gg:) Her rook is just screaming to get into the game, and while she targets the black b pawn valuable time is being wasted that will allow black to roll up the kingside.} Rc7 {? Black joins white in La La Land (sorry Charlie:) Be1 protects the b pawn and hastens Bc3 , and the text only threatens the queen that was moving anyway.} 51. Qxb4 Qf6+ {Black emerges from his fog and rightfully gets things into gear.} 52. Ka2 {Interesting choice. Qc3 may have been better, as it would encourage a queen swap. White's defensive priorities would be cut drastically to just stopping the black pawn advance. The text is not all together bad, however, as it puts the king on the opposite color of the black bishop.} f3 {Black has had enough, and commits to winning straight away.} 53. Qb8+ Kd7 54. Qg8 {White ignores the promotion threat, and sets up another check threat.} f2 55. Qd5+ {? hmm....55. Qh7  Kc8 56. Qg8  Kd7 57. Qh7  Kc8 58. Qg8  Kd7 and white is right in it.} Ke7 56. Re2+ {White FINALLY gets the rook involved. Now, she MUST keep up the check pressure to avoid black getting another queen.} Kf8 57. Qa8+ Kg7 58. Ne3 {White's poor rook is so passive. This knight move was the only real possibility to snag the promoter.} Rc1 {? Black continues to give white too much hope. Better to just promote, take the knight, and start nailing the coffin shut.} 59. Qb7+ {White continues to hang on. At first glance, black appears to be clearly ahead. I ran this position through Shredder, and got the most fascinating line that I wanted to share here: [ 59. Nf5  Kh7 (59...QxN 60. Re7  Qf7 61. RxQ  KxR 62. Qd5  Kf6 63. Qd4  Kg6 64. Qe4  Kf6 65. Qd4  Kg6 66. Qe4  Kf6 67. Qd4 =) 60. Re7  Kg6 61. NxB gxN 62. Qe4  Kg5 63. Qe3  Kg4 64. Re4  Kh5 65. Re5  Kg6 66. Q Kf7 67. Qb7  Rc7 68. QxR Kg6] Now, I find absolutely no fault with gothicgirl's last move - I mean, there is little possibility that a fellow human of non-titled strength could have seen that sequence. I just it was too pretty not to mention:) As it is, white is taking advantage of the reprieve black has given her and continues to keep up what little pressure she can in this position.} Kg6 60. Qe4+ Kh5 61. Qg4+ {White keeps finding ways to hang on!} Kh6 62. Nf5+ {! Yeah baby! White sees the chance to get her rook in on the action!} Qxf5 {Once again, black has had enough of this and pins his hopes on the promotion on f1.} 63. Qxf5 {?? NO! Re6 ! saves the game! Follow this line: 63. Re6  QxR 64. QxQ Kh5 65. Qe2  Kh6 66. Qe6  Kh5 67. Qe2  Kh6 68. Qe6 . } f1=Q {Black now has the goods, and must simply evade a few annoying checks.} 64. Re6+ Kh5 65. Qh7+ Kg4 66. Re4+ Kf3 67. Qf5+ Kg2 68. Qg4+ Kh1 {Black is now temporarily safe from check.} 69. Ka3 {White is out of ideas. Black now pours on the pain.} Ra1+ 70. Kb4 Qf8+ 71. Kc3 Be1+ {With this bishop now in the game and controlling dark squares, white is seriously on the ropes.} 72. Kd4 Qf2+ 73. Kd5 Qf7+ 74. Ke5 {?? White's best chance was 74. Kc6 Rc1  75. Rc4 Qf6  76. Kb7 RxR 77. dxR} Bc3+ {Very workable, but Bg3  wins, as if the bishop is taken black wins the white queen after Qc7 .} 75. d4 {Nice! White is desperately trying to get the one tempo she needs to do some attacking herself!} Qe7+ 76. Kf5 {?? Yikes! What about 76. Kd5 Qf7  Kc6?????? Black now marks a '1' on the wall chart.} Rf1+ 77. Kg6 Rf6+ 78. Kxg5 Qg7+ 79. Kh4 Rh6+ 80. Kg3 Rg6 {And white has had enough. I thought was a thoroughly entertaining game. Both sides made mistakes, of course, but it was interesting to me how the outcome was not decided until very late - after both sides had squandered chances yet were let off of the hook almost immediately by their opponent. I replayed it a few times just to watch how the tempo and initiative kept passing back and forth. I felt like I was at a tennis match:) I take nothing away from these two fine players, and I hope my annotation did not appear harsh. It's always so much easier to armchair quarterback someone else's game when you have the benefit of an engine:) Many thanks to abe66 and gothicgirl for the game, and I hope you have enjoyed it:) - Thomas}
