Qd2 f5 {Attempt to challenge bishop aggressively at possible cost of pawn but also likely it blocks off defense of knight.} 12. Nxg5 f4 13. dxe5 {Probably should have taken the knight here.} dxe5 14. Ne6 Qe7 15. Bxf4 exf4 16. Qxf4 Rc8 17. Nxf8 Qxf8 18. Qg5 Nf7 {good move putting pressure back on the queen.} 19. Qe3 Ba8 20. a4 Nce5 21. axb5 Bxd5 22. exd5 axb5 23. Nxb5 Qb4 24. Na7 Ra8 25.
