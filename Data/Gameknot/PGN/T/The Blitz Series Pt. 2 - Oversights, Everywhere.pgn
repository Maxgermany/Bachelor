1. e4 {I go for my usual.} e5 {No Sicilian shenanigans for this match.} 2. Nf3 {Still common for my White play.} Nc6 {Looking good so far, this is what I'm used to playing against.} 3. d4 {I try a Scotch opening for this match. It's a been a long time since I've used this, but I find it a touch more aggressive for White than the Four Knights approach. I was interested to see how a match against a skilled player would go for me, as I didn't feel like playing as passive this time.} exd4 {He exchanges, as per the main line.} 4. Nxd4 {This is usual for White to do.} Nxd4 {For Black, not so much. I normally see Black succeeding more with the Nf6 line, as the c6 knight can keep the Queen at bay from exchanges, whereas now I might be able to get away with pulling her out. This is more aggressive than I'm used to.} 5. Qxd4 {So my queen takes the center.} c5 {Black is still opting for more aggressive development. I had to think for a few seconds.} 6. Qc3 {Qd1 would waste moves on my tempo. Qd5 could be chased by Nf6, and any 4th-rank square could allow Black to develop more pawns while I draw my queen away. While this does block both the c-pawn and Nc3, I felt this was the most logical move on my part to allow for more development on my end.} d6 {Black plans to stake a claim to the center with better central pawns than White can offer. It works.} 7. Be3 {So I plan to fight back with back-rank piece development, starting with this bishop as this will give a possibly needed Qd2 more freedom. I need not worry about Bb4 for the next bit of time.} Nf6 {He hits my e-pawn and strengthens a possible d5 after his O-O.} 8. Bd3 {I don't want to do f3 just yet. I haven't fully figured out which way I want to castle yet, and I don't want to indicate a forced direction by pushing the other six pawns too soon.} Be7 {Black, however, clearly gets more out of castling short for this match.} 9. b4 {This means that a queenside pawn storm is inevitable if I don't deter it now. My king is not in danger for the time being, and I want to give myself some sort of edge on the board once we decide to put the kings away in a corner. Is there another case I could make to do O-O-O instead?} b6 {He decides to defend the attack. Even so, I feel as though 9 ...d5 would have been stronger here. It would have centralized his pawns even further, and there wouldn't be much for me to do about it.} 10. O-O {With something going on in the board now, I move to hide the kings.} O-O {He obliges, probably wanting to see what I plan on doing.} 11. bxc5 {This was to make both b5 and d5 weaker to play for Black. I had also planned to move my queen to an undetermined square later on, so that I can plan c4 and stop any pawn storms from ruining my defenses. I'm not as sure anymore if this was the right idea to have, however. What do you think?} bxc5 {Anyway, he chooses to keep the pawns centralized. Definitely stronger than dxc5.} 12. f3 {I know e4 is about to be pressured, so I opt to give it more defenses right now.} Bb7 {He develops his LSB, and adds even more pressure to e4.} 13. Qb3 {This was my first mistake in the match. Better was Qd2, I think. I wanted my queen on the long diagonal because I believed I had the means to build threats on d5, e6, and f7, without hindering rooks on either d1 or e1. I'll get punished for this in a second.} Qc7 {Stopping Qxb7, an attack I wasn't even intending to build. He sees a much better move next turn.} 14. c4 {Deterring ...d5, as I've always planned.} Rab8 {I'm still not noticing the danger my queen is in at the moment. Black is gaining a lot of tempo on me right now, and I'm still too focused on the pawns to see it.} 15. Nc3 {Another mistake on my part. This adds another defender to e4, and another threat to d5, but I should have played Qc2 first, followed by this.} Bxe4 {Now my queen must move, and I've lost a pawn for nothing, giving him full control of the game at this point. Black is now the deciding force of how pieces will be exchanged from here onward.} 16. Qc2 {I don't want to restrict my queen to d1, so I defend my bishop like this.} Bxd3 {He takes it anyway.} 17. Qxd3 {Now my queen goes here, still well in front of my rooks. I know I need to develop my pieces a little more, but Black is about to attack, yet again.} Nd7 {-Or worse. Black probably realized that I wasn't comfortable with my situation, and wanted to adjust a little more for stronger points of attacks now that my central pawns and queen pawns are neutralized.} 18. Rfe1 {I cannot allow Black to seize the e-file without issue.} Ne5 {And he targets the queen, probably hoping to develop more pieces in chasing her a little further.} 19. Qf1 {However, I'm pretty happy with her right here for the time being. I don't have to fully retreat just yet, and I have a certain idea in mind with the board like this.} Bf6 {But my tempo is still a bit too far behind Black. This strengthens Rfe8, and I didn't even notice what else this long diagonal offered Black for this game...} 20. Nd5 {I sensed the Bishop was a bit too strong, so I try to get rid of it by moving his queen.} Qd8 {However, this is a fantastic square to reassure Black can keep control of the long dark diagonal. I was less confident about Nxf6+ now.} 21. f4 {I didn't want to take the Bishop just yet, because my intention was always to use the last of my pawns to pressure Black while having enough maneveur room for my King. That would have been a little more risky had I decided to let the Black Queen sit at f6, hoping for me to expose my king later.} Nxc4 {However, he sets up another gambit, and I don't even realize how it's a gambit right away. What is White's best move, everyone?} 22. Qxc4 {At the time, I guessed this. But I feel as though, right now, I should have done Nxf6+. If Nxf6, Black must do Qxf6, and now I can play Qxc4. In an actual GameKnot match, I might have had a true advantage having lost two pawns for his Dark Bishop. } Bxa1 {Instead, I overlooked this move, and I feel as though the match is lost at this point.} 23. Rxa1 {So I might as well exchange.} Rb4 {And out of nowhere, this appears. Had I done 22. Nxf6+, this would never have been a blunder. } 24. Nxb4 {My knight ended up saving the day, yet again. My opponent had a hard think, and clearly tried to figure out something to do about this degree of error...} cxb4 {So they reluctantly capture the knight...} 25. Bxa7 {and I see this move, secluding the two center black pawns, and possessing my Dark Bishop means that I can attack the kingside fairly easily, as we're 3v2 for back pieces against the Black King. My opponent resigns here, sure that I would know how to secure my win with this advantage. I was thrilled I did well, although I wish both our games were better handled at the midgame!
