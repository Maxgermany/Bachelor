[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 2. e5 {The "quiet"way... a line I played so much...} Bf5 3. d4 e6 {The white's lsb has d7 (very passive), d6 (played in the game, looking for the exchange, or Bb4+, the well-known attack. It should be played after black goes c5, however, or it will be answered with c6, with tempo. } 4. Nf3 a6 {This is "my" move. I simply don't like b5 - Bb4+. It is playable, for sure, but it gives initiative to white. } 5. Bd3 {White felt like this. My answer is already prepared. } Bg6 {Another "loss of tempo". But black wants to keep the pawn chain solid, and the centre closed... until he breaks in with c5. } 6. O-O {If white does this, it means he doesn't want to start the bishop's exchange. } c5 {My turn to become active. Look at the board: black seems to be playing foolishly, wasting tempo with pawn moves, while his pieces are still undevelopen. } 7. c3 {White doesn't seize the initiative. This move makes it difficult to me to develop my dsb. } Nc6 {Finally. } 8. b3 {Interesting, and still not attacking. In chess, when you "just wait", normally, the opponent will "do something". } Qa5 {Like this. Suddenly, developement is almost equal. White has to play carefully the developement of his queenside. } 9. Bxg6 {This was played to avoid my bishop to take his after a piece goes to d7, but it has a "little" downside...} hxg6 {I open the column. } 10. a4 {This is the developement way black choose... over Bd7, and this gives me an idea. } b5 {Being axb4 impossible due to QxR.} 11. Ba3 {Interesting. } b4 {I take advantage of the fact that white can't play c4, closing the game, because of the bishop. Black created problems in white's developement...} 12. cxb4 {Nxb5 is the good move. But I was thinking: "how to exploit h2", so I thought about Qc7 and some Nxd5 sac (if NxN, Qxh2#). But it's a long road to there. } cxb4 13. Bc1 {Bb2 will be a waste of a bishop. But I don't have developed my kingside... we have both of us a complete wing undeveloped... as far as move 13!} Qb6 {Still preventing a white piece to go to e7 (Nxd5). } 14. Be3 {The proper place for the bishop... just defending. I have my answer to this already prepared. } Nh6 {This knight is aiming to g4, of course. } 15. Bxh6 {A passive bishop for a "near active" knight... but look at the downside. } Rxh6 {gxh was good: undoubles pawns, gives a way for the dsb to leave his home square... but this one gives a semiopen column to the white king. I have to be sure I have time to take the bishop and king out of the way. I can't play Qc7 because of Qc1, but still my weapons are becoming dangerous. } 16. Qd3 {As good as it seems, this move just allows white to develop the knight, that's all. White is not in a hurry to try to occupy the c column (or he wants to bring out the knight first). } a5 {This was a good square for the knight. but I didn't want surprises on the queenside. If Qb5, I welcome the exchange, since the resulting white pawns couldn't be defended. } 17. Nbd2 {The knight is out, but it has no place to go, nor attack. It will take three moves to align the rooks on the c columns. Plenty of time, because I plan to use the king to help control the c column. } Be7 {This was necessary. } 18. Rac1 {First tempo. No problem. } Kd7 {He he, "surprise". } 19. h3 {White realizes the danger and defends. Good. Now, what will be my "secret weapon", my "ace in the sleeve"?} g5 {Yesssss. The nasty pawn. } 20. Rc2 {Building pressure, but giving me tempo to...} g4 {Ups. If Ne1(!?), gxh3, and Nxd4 is threatened, too. Black has to take. } 21. hxg4 {Thank you. } Rah8 22. g3 {Only one, I think. If it wasn't because of the knight, I could give second check with h7. Can he take the knight out of f3? Yes, because this will leave the square to the king. But the Nf3 is also guarding d5, and on this square my knight c6 will give a fork check... I didn't need more. } Bg5 {Offering the bishop, just to take away the knight from f3 for one move. If he doesn't take, I'll have to work out something new... something I just don't see right now...} 23. Nxg5 {But white takes. I will test my theory...} Rh6h1+ 24. Kg2 Rh8h2+ 25. Kf3 {RxR doesn't help because of NxR, adding a defender to f2. So...} Nxd4+ 26. Kf4 {Defender gone. King in a mate net if something land on f2 while the black queen is adding his power to that square. So...} Nxc2 {White loses material... but hey, I am down a bishop... } 27. Qxc2 {If RxR, Qxf2+, Ngf3. } Rxf1 28. Nde4 {The only one, but...} Rfxf2+ 29. Nxf2 Rxf2+ {And white resigns. Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed the game, and I didn't overlook too many moves. }
