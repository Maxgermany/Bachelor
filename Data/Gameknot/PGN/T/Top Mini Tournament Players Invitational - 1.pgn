[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {For those that know me, I play the Scandanavian a lot. It immediately rips up the center, and is a "surprise" move to a lot of players who play 1. e4. This opening leads white into a few very tough decisions right from the start, but is actually more defensive in nature than it appears at this stage (at least the variation that I prefer).} 2. exd5 {White is offered an appetizer, and correctly munches it down.} Qxd5 {Regaining material equality. Now, however, black's queen is vulnerable to attack from 3. Nc6.} 3. Qf3 {?! A rather dubious refutation. As I have played the Scandanavian against manhattan numerous times, I'm fairly sure he wants to get me out of my comfort zone. By offering up this queen exchange, white intends to recapture with tempo by playing 4. NxQ. As I am fairly familiar with manhattan's style of play, I choose to accept his offer. Having lost many more games to him than I have won, I have come to realize that his opening play is stronger than mine, and by getting into the middlegame as soon as possible, I hope to even the odds a bit.} Qxf3 4. Nxf3 a6 {?! R.I.P. "book". Black declines the chance to maintain equality in development, and opts for a very defensive play. By restricting white's light squared bishop, black hopes to dig in a fight a defensive battle. Not aggressive at all, I know, but with the queens off the board I felt it was just as important to decide where I wanted HIS pieces, not just mine.} 5. d4 {White correctly begins to punish blacks passive play by staking a claim in the center.} b5 {?! Yet another extremely dubious move! Black again neglects his own development and further restricts whites light squared bishop. Black has every intention of getting his own light squared bishop to b7 to dominate the all important long diagonal.} 6. a3 {? I'm sure if manhattan were annotating this game, he would have already given me a few well deserved question marks, so I don't feel too bad about questioning this move. White should have gone ahead and extended his lead in development by playing any one of numerous moves. I expected Bf4. By playing 6. a3, I can only assume that he wanted to restrict my dark squared bishop. As he already has a 4-3 pawn advantage on the queenside, I consider this a waste of time.} Bb7 {As intended.} 7. Be2 {Developing, and preparing 0-0.} e6 {Black activates his dark squared bishop, and envisions exchanging pawns on c5 with some tempo.} 8. c3 {? This turns out to be a telling move of the game.  At first glance, it appears to be a least worth consideration, as it locks down the dark squares on the queenside after white plays b4. This would give white a pretty strong pawn structure. It's hidden weakness, however, is that it restricts the Nb1. After what I consider to a mistaken 13th move, this weakness will be punished severely.} c5 {Black continues with his plan. Also worth considering was Nf6.} 9. dxc5 {White correctly takes, as he fears the loss of a pawn.} Bxc5 10. O-O {White secures his king. I remember feeling fairly confident at this stage, as both of my bishops are now pointing right towards his king.} Nf6 {Developing and preparing for 0-0.} 11. Be3 {White sees the dangers posed by black's bishop battery, and opts to negate it. Also worth considering was Bg5.} Bxe3 {! White will now be straddled with an isolated pawn.} 12. fxe3 O-O {Black has now almost reached his goal. Developing the Nb8 is all that remains.} 13. Nd4 {? Nbd2 was the play. Now white gets punished for this oversight.} Nc6 {Welcoming the exchange of knights, as the d file can now be obtained.} 14. Nxc6 Bxc6 15. Bf3 {? once again, Nbd2 was the play.} Bxf3 {Study this position. Black now aims to get pieces off the board so he can exploit the isolated pawn and dominate the d file.} 16. Rxf3 {Interesting choice. White protects the isolated pawn and (I assume) hopes to load both rooks on the f file. The only problem with that idea is.................} Rfd8 {! Now white's knight is hurting him severely.} 17. Kf2 {White correctly intends to get his king to e2 so he can develop his knight. The problem with THAT idea is..........} Rd1 {! Black is now licking his chops. The d file can now be fully dominated by shifting the Ra8 to d8, and white's knight is pinned against his Ra1.} 18. Ke2 Rad8 19. Rf1 {White's isolated pawn is safely protected by his king, so he intends an attempt to remove all the rooks from the board and enter an endgame with only a very slight disadvantage. While he has an isolated pawn, his king is much closer to the center - which is potentially very strong.} Rxf1 {Black sees a way to start gobbling pawns while maintaing pressure on white's back rank.} 20. Kxf1 Rd1+ {Checking and maintaing the brutal pin.} 21. Ke2 Rh1 22. h3 {Forced.} Nh5 {Looking to throw another check via g3.} 23. Kd2 {White is forced to waste more time trying to develop his problem knight.} Rh2 {As the pin is not needed for the next move, black utilizes his time advantage to gobble pawns.} 24. Kc2 Rxg2+ {Tasty appetizer.....*burp*:)} 25. Nd2 {White finally gets to develop his problem knight, and is "rewarded" by having it pull immediate defensive duty to block the check.} Rh2 {Perusing the entree menu:)} 26. Rf1 {White finally gets active. At this point, my main concern was white's pawn majority on the queenside. I assume that manhattan sees this as well, and I'm sure he will attempt to convert either his a or b pawn.} Rxh3 {*burp*} 27. e4 {? Not sure about this move. White should start pressing his queenside pawn advantage..} Re3 {Strong. The white knight now has another weakness - it can't move.} 28. Rd1 {Here is where I got a little worried, as I am vulnerable to a back row mate.} g6 {This move was designed only to create an escape square for my king.} 29. Nb3 {White gives up on his e pawn and goes "all in" for a queenside push.} Re2+ {! Taking the e pawn would have been a mistake, as it would give white a powerful initiative.} 30. Kd3 {White wants to press ahead and not play a passive king move to the back rank.} Nf4+ {Nice! Black gets his knight off of the edge, delivers a check, AND protects the rook!} 31. Kd4 {As he is committed to rushing the queenside anyway, he pushes ahead at the cost of yet another pawn.} Rxb2 {*burp* Yummy dessert.  This rook is putting on the pounds due to his pawn rich diet:)} 32. Na5 {While forward moving and somewhat aggressive, I expected 32. Nc5.} Ra2 {Looking at the after dinner drinks menu........} 33. Ke5 {Hmmm.....It took me some time to realize that I shouldn't be scared of this move. White's 32nd is proven to be incorrect.} Rxa3 {*hiccup* Can I get the check please? White cannot take the Nf4 as his own knight will fall.} 34. Nc6 {manhattan starts closing in on my king. I start thinking that I may be in trouble. If he can get his king to f6, I have problems.} Rxc3 {One last pawn:) I realize that even if white's king gets to f6, I can play Na5 ! Now, white must continue kamakaze style to have any chance.} 35. Rd8+ {Obviously.} Kg7 36. Ne7 {Looking to play Rg8 .} Nh5 {Black realizes that he has a safe escape square for his king in h6, so he correctly he protects the f6 square.} 37. Rg8+ Kh6 38. Rf8 {! The f pawn appears to be very weak.} f5 {Black feels that any direct threat to his can be sidestepped, so he lashes out in an attempt to remove yet another white pawn.} 39. exf5 exf5 40. Ra8 {White is safely controlling a lot of territory aroung the black king, so he aims to get some pawns back.} Re3+ {This move was designed to deflect white's king from the f file. I anticipated an attempt to push it towards promotion.} 41. Kd6 f4 42. Ng8+ Kg7 {! White cannot throw another check or his knight falls. This move gains time for black.} 43. Ne7 f3 44. Nd5 {White now has multiple issues to deal with, as there are a lot of potential queens out there that must be dealt with.} Rd3 {This pin was designed to free up some space and time for further movement of the f pawn.} 45. Ke6 f2 46. Ra7+ {Not much else to do in this position. White is probably looking for some sequence that will give him perpetual checks. } Kh6 {Black has some good escape squares, however.} 47. Nf6 {This move effectively ends the game. A trade of knights and black can promote with a strong check.} f1=Q {?! Believe it or not, I failed to recognize how strong the knight exchange would have been. I'm still on cruise control though, and figured since I had made such a patzer-like mistake, I should go ahead and try for something a little more artistic:)} 48. Rxh7+ {Obviously.} Kg5 {I guess that I was just so proud of my escape square that I felt compelled to use it!} 49. Ne4+ {White clings to hope.} Kh4 {I should have named this game "The beauty of the escape square":) The rest of the game is mere technique.} 50. Rf7 Qh3+ 51. Ke5 Qh2+ 52. Ke6 Nf4+ 53. Kf6 Nd5+ 54. Kxg6 Qg1+ 55. Kh6 Qe3+ 56. Rf4+ Qxf4+ 57. Ng5 Qxg5+ 58. Kh7 Nf6+ {And white resigns. I felt this game worthy of publication (even with my ridiculous 47th!) as it shows the dangers involved in not getting developed. White's queenside knight cost him dearly in this game, and a good lesson can be learned. I'm sure my good friend manhattan will repay me in kind! He practically owns me overall:) And as for the food and drink references - I'm a chef by trade, so just get over it or "NO SOUP FOR YOU!" :) I hope you have enjoyed - Thomas}
