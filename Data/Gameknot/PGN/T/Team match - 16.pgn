1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 {benoni! interesting choice. } 3. d5 b5 {aaaah. benko gambit. very interesting choice indeed. fun for both sides, normally. } 4. b3 {declined. not a very popular move, but this will not be a standard benko gambit. } bxc4 {interesting choice. open b file to fight over. Black can try to gang up on the c4 button.} 5. bxc4 d6 {a bit early for my tastes. it will be played sooner or later anyway (to permit the N to develop to d7 and either f8 or b6. ...g6 is to be considered. } 6. Nf3 e6 7. Nc3 Be7 8. e4 O-O 9. Be2 {both sides are developing. Black has castled first this is good. I would be looking at either ...Nbd7/ Nb6 & ...Ba6 to gang up on the weak base of the pawn chain. also to be considered for Black is ...Na6 & ...Rb8. } Qa5 10. Bd2 Qc7 {since the queen was safe enough from an attack with a N move, ...exd, 11.cxd Bg4 should be considered. it is not clear that the queen is better placed on c7 than d8 when weighed against the probable move of the dark squared bishop. White is also one move closer (for free) to doubling the rooks on the open file. } 11. O-O Nbd7 {again: 11...exd, 12.cxd Bg4 to be considered. with this move, Black is in danger of just not having enough space to move & survive. someone more skilled than I had a comment long ago that a cramped position has the seeds of defeat already sown. } 12. Nb5 {While Rb1 or Qc2 are probably stronger, I think this is a very nice move. Black's Queen must move "again". now White is threatening d6, though not immediately. } Qd8 {...Qb6 to be considered... } 13. Qa4 {to be considered are 13.dxe fxe, 14.Qc2 intending rooks to the d file hammering on the backward pawn on an open file. ... now black gains material & initiative with 13....Nxe4!   } Nb6 {both sides missed ...Nxe4. White protects the pawn. } 14. Qc2 a6 {I am not sure this is a good move, since the N on b6 needs support after Rb1... I would prefer ...Re8, then ...exd, cxd, ...Bg4, } 15. Nc3 Bd7 16. Rab1 Rb8 17. a4 a5 {NOT a good move. the button was keeping the White N off of b5.   imo: ...Qc7 is better, connecting the Rooks, then if a5 by white, ...Na8 permits the rooks to face each other. exchanges occur, black is not significantly worse as his pieces should have sufficient scope to move.} 18. Nb5 {now White is in danger of blowing Black off the board. ...exd is not good, as exd keeps Black's pieces in disarray. white can look forward to "student body right" with every expectation of mating the undefendable Black king... also note the undefended Black button on a5... } exd5 {I think as defensive as it appears, ...Nc8 is needed here, permitting the Q to cover a5, then ...Re8, ...Bf8, ...Ne7, at least moves pieces to cover the kingside. } 19. e5 {must be given a ?! as this is speculative (at best) and uncramps Black's position without helping White much... 19...dxe5 20.Nxe5 Ra8 appears to be above even. 19.exd6 is far superior. } Bxb5 {19....Bxb5 is not really a bad move, just not the best. if white recaptures with 20.cxb, he gets a protected passed pawn. Black's center pawns will not be able to move far forward without becoming weak. } 20. axb5 dxe5 21. Nxe5 Qd6 {I would prefer c7 as I could interpose the B on d6 if needed. following 21....Qd6 with 22.Bf4, White is threatening to win an exchange with Ng6. } 22. Nc6 Rb7 23. Nxa5 Rd7 24. Be3 {at this point, white appears to be slightly ahead, though the decision is far from apparent. for white, i would prefer 24.Rfe1 to this move as 24.Be3 is weak if Black follows it with 24...d4!  Each side has a protected passer and the game is very very double edged. both kings relatively safe. very very dangerous position for both sides, but no one appears to have an advantage after 24.d4. } Rc7 {not a "bad move", but not the best move. } 25. Rfd1 {wrong square. Rooks belong on open files. accordingly Rfe1. } Rd8 {again: 25.d4 is needed. it protects the button on c5 and is a protected passer. } 26. Nc6 Ra8 {...Re8 is far to be preferred. now white can set up strongly with 27.cxd Nfd5 28.Bf3 and black's material starts dropping. } 27. Qf5 {as noted above, not the strongest move on the board for White. but white is threatening Bf4 skewering Q & R, as well as Bf3, threatening the R on a8... } dxc4 {OOOPS. ...Bf8, ...Re8, and ...Ra2 are all defensible, but dropping one's Queen in an "almost equal" position is NOT GOOD.   up till this move, the game has been very interesting. much fun to annotate. } 28. Rxd6 {}
