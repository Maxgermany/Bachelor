1. d4 {Winning a game always feels wonderful and it is something that fuels the desire for many people to play more chess, but it is the difficult study and struggle that helps you improve your game. I played this game after a week study of positional play. I undertook it in hopes of improving my ability to place my pieces more aggressively and securely. This game was the reward that I claimed from it.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 {The game began with an Indian Defense response from my opponent.} 3. Nf3 {Here I developed my K-side Knight first, to wait and see where my opponent would place his K-side bishop...} Nc6 {but he develops his other Knight instead, thus transposing into the Mexican defense} 4. a3 {I wanted to avoid a pin on my Knight, so I moved the pawn to a3 before developing the Knight to c3.} h6 {My opponent responded in similar prophylactics, but this weakens the Black K-side. Furthermore, the pin would hardly have been that annoying for Black, since now, that i played a3, the only good way to develop his K-side bishop to is e7 - and that intercepts the pin, rendering it harmless. Therefore, imho, this was a wasted flank move that also weakened Black K-side.} 5. Nc3 {I continued with my intended development, here expecting my opponent to make the move d5 battling for the CENTRAL CONTROL, creating a position somewhat similar to a Queen Gambit declined...} Be7 {But my opponent neglected the importance of the center of the board and that allowed me to seize it myself...} 6. e4 {With my Q-side Knight developed and not pinned by anything I brought the third pawn into the center of the board. I can mention, that my previous study had helped me to reevaluate the IMPORTANCE OF THE CENTER myself. Prior to that my view towards the center was somewhat ignorant, even though not entirely non-existent.} d6 {My opponent formed a defensive center that allowed me to plan and initiate central breaks, thus giving me a lot of INITIATIVE.} 7. Bd3 {Before planning any sort of an opening in the center I need to get my own King off of it. I intend to castle K-side, so I need to develop my K-side Bishop first. Developing it to e2 would be completely passive ...the Bishop does a whole lot more on d3, most importantly it plans the move e5, attacking the Knight and opening up the b1-h7 diagonal, that becomes very strong if Black castles K-side.} a6 {My opponent might be intending a flank attack with b5, but it doesn't carry much threat as b5 would be responded with b3 - securing the center one more time. So a6 was also a wasted move...} 8. O-O {I BRING MY KING TO SAFETY} O-O {My opponent castles K-side and my e5 break is claiming more value} 9. Re1 {I make my last preparation with 9. Re1 - it gives me more attacking lines against the Black King. Here I might be thinking about exchanging my f3 Knight to open up the d1-h5 diagonal for my queen and then plan for some sacrificial attacks like Bxh6. It also enables me with a possible Rook lift to the third rank and increase the pressure on the pawns in front of the Black King. Additionally, it increases my control of the e pawn. Other than all that, it is a normal developing move that masks up my pending plan a little...} Bd7 {My opponent makes yet another passive move. It might have been much better to fianchetto that Bishop... } 10. e5 {Now my e5 plan comes into action. It will force the Black Knight to move, thus giving me a tempo while i succeed in clearing the b1-h7 diagonal. Moreover, the Black pieces are denied access to the K-side, making my K-side sacrifices worth thinking about.} dxe5 11. dxe5 Nh7 {The Black Knight doesn't have any good squares to go to: Nh5 would loose the Knight to g4; Ng4 would loose it to h3; Ne6 would cramp up the Black pieces even more than they already are; And Nh7 helps White develop with yet another tempo...} 12. Qc2 {Now White is threatening to take the h7 Knight without any compensation for Black} Ng5 {g6 would loose to Bxh6, so Ng5 is the only valid response for Black.} 13. Nxg5 {This exchange is pretty much forced, but it allows White a Rook lift to e3 and Rg3 after that, so this exchange is good for White. Also, Black is loosing a defender on the K-side for White's passive K-side piece. } hxg5 {This was a very bad move - Black now has no defense on the h file. The correct line should have been 13. ... Bxg5 14. Bxh5 Qxh5 15. Re3, but it is also good for White and the K-side pressure doesn't end there...} 14. Re3 {With the h file semi-opened, it is time for the rook lift, intending Rh3 with good mating opportunities. } Nd4 {Here Black tries to counter attack, but the threat against the White Queen is blunderous. This allows for the White Queen to improve it's position with tempo} 15. Bh7+ Kh8 16. Qd3 {The Queen is very strong here, as it accompanies both attacking pieces of the game: the Rook and the Bishop. And of course, it also attacks the Black Knight on d4, forcing it to move.} Nb3 {The Knight runs to the Q-side, forking the Rook and the bishop...} 17. Rh3 {...but now the K-side has no defenders and mate is imminent after 17. Rh3. This 'triangular' Queen-Rook-Bishop attack has some esthetic beauty to it, that encouraged me to annotate this game ;)} g6 {Black is attempting to avoid mate, but the pawns are poor defenders here... Mate is forced} 18. Bxg6+ Kg7 19. Rh7+ Kg8 20. Bxf7+ Rxf7 21. Qg6+ Kf8 22. Rh8# {Qxf6# or Rh8#. I chose the one that maintains White's material deficit (-1), only for the romanticism of being down in material ;)  I was happy of my performance in this tournament game, since I achieved it through some meaningful chess study, that I had never taken up that seriously before. And with that note I would like to encourage everyone who wants to improve their chess to spend more time studying game principals and theory rather than just experimenting various moves in the games. ;)}
