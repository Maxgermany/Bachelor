[Opening "Sicilian (B33), Pelikan, Bird variation"]

1. e4 c5 {I guess I'll have to start mixing it up sooner or later to prevent deep preparation, but so far that's not been necessary. Anyway, the Sicilian is, in my opinion, the best defense to 1. e4.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Bxf6 {A peculiar move order that gives me a few extra options but none are as good as the main lines.} gxf6 9. Na3 {For example, here I could have played 9...f5, but then the Na3 can come to c4 and White has resolved the main problem of this opening early on.} b5 10. Nd5 f5 {I've seen Magnus sticking to 10...Bg7 here, probably to avoid some sharper and forced lines. I'm still happy with this move and I don't intend to switch in the near future.} 11. c3 {A particularly useful move for White. It covers both d4 and b4, it makes room for the Na3 to be brought into play via c2 and in some lines it allows the White Queen to come into play.} Bg7 12. Bd3 Be6 13. O-O Bxd5 {Now the game has transposed to a main line of the opening.} 14. exd5 Ne7 {All very natural moves by both sides. I have a slight worse pawn structure but a temporary superiority in the center.} 15. Nc2 O-O 16. Qh5 {I think this is all theory, with a rather balanced statistic. I think it would be hard to say White has achieved much from the opening here.} e4 17. Be2 f4 {A rather loose looking move, but you cannot afford to play passively with Black. Your only chance is active counterplay or else White will slowly push you off the board.} 18. a4 {One of White's ideas for counterplay in this line. He attacks my b5 pawn and either forces me to give up a pawn or activate his pieces and be stuck with a weak pawn on the a-file.} Ng6 19. Bg4 {Trying to win the b5 pawn immediately runs into all sorts of problems. After 19. axb5 f3 20. Bc4 (20. gxf3 Nf4) fxg2 21. Rfe1 (21. Kxg2 Nf4+) axb5 22. Rxa8 Qxa8 23. Bxb5 Qa2! and White's Q-side pawns will fall, his pieces are stuck on the wrong side of the board and his King is more vulnerable than mine. With the text, White gives up on trying to win the pawn and instead focuses on keeping his Bishop active.} Re8 {Just activating the Rook. The f-file isn't going to open any time soon, so the Rf8 was the piece that needed to be activated.} 20. axb5 axb5 21. Rxa8 Qxa8 22. Ra1 {My opponent swaps a pair of Rooks in order to seize the a-file and gain entry to the weak points on my Q-side.} Qb7 23. Nb4 Re5 {I was thinking about pushing the e-pawn directly, but first I wanted to misplace his Queen.} 24. Qh3 f3 {Vacating the f4 square for the Knight and weakening the White castle.} 25. gxf3 h5 {Taking isn't possible because of Nf4, so White has to move the Bishop.} 26. Bc8 Nf4 {Inviting a Queen swap. Around here I was thinking that this was going to be an early draw.} 27. Bxb7 Nxh3+ 28. Kg2 Nf4+ 29. Kf1 {29. Kg3 draws on the spot and I have to keep checking with the Knight in order not to lose material.} exf3 {Now the f3 pawn is rather pesky for White. f2 can become weak and the back rank needs defending as well. Still, I think my opponent was fully justified to play on.} 30. Bc6 {Now the b5 pawn seems to be a goner.} Re2 {Putting the Rook on the most active square. The b2 pawn is attacked and f2 is under pressure as well.} 31. Rb1 {White has to defend, or else c3 will become weak after both b-pawns will be removed from the board.} Nh3 {Not giving my opponent time to breathe.} 32. Nd3 {Forced. There is no other way to defend f2.} b4 {Now the b-pawn has turned from a weakling into an attacking piece.} 33. Re1 {Since the Nd3 defends b2 as well, White proposes a Rook swap to ease the tension in his position.} Rd2 {Still attacking. Now White's main defending piece comes under fire from the hyperactive Rook.} 34. Re3 {The Knight couldn't move or else both pawns would have fallen. Defending with Bb5 just loses a pawn after bxc3. Now White wants to mix defending with attacking. He's not only defending his Nd3 but also attacking the f3 pawn, the main source of his conundrums.} Rd1+ {But now the first rank is weak and I keep on forcing my opponent to make only moves.} 35. Ne1 {Again forced.} Bxc3 {This was a very satisfying move to play. For six moves, White has been in the ropes and his position is slowly but surely getting worse. } 36. bxc3 {Again, forced, but a piece for a pawn can't be such a bad deal. Or can it?} b3 {Now the pawn is two steps away from Queening and all of White's pieces are poorly placed to stop it. His Knight is pinned, his Rook is stuck on the third rank, suffocated by its own pieces and the Bishop needs two moves to get into the action.} 37. Re8+ {The fatal error. White's best shot was 37. Bd7 b2 38. Bf5 Rxd5 39. c4 Rxf5 40. Rb3 Rf4 41. Rxb2 Ng5 42. Rc2, and although White will suffer, I think he can draw this ending, since my pawn structure doesn't allow me to make too much progress. With the move in the game, White keeps his Bishop stuck on c6 and allows me activate my last piece, my King.} Kg7 38. Rb8 Nf4 {Another blow for White. Now Nd3 is a deadly threat, much more important than a pawn Queening.} 39. Ba4 {Finally bringing the Bishop into play but still rather clumsily.} Ng2 {Forcing White to swing back the Rook to stave off mate.} 40. Re8 b2 {And the pawn is saved once more. Quite a metamorphosis, from a weak pawn on b5, this pawn that was looking like dead meat just ten moves ago, has now become the star player on the chess board.} 41. Bc2 {The only way to stop the pawn from Queening.} Rc1 {The Rook seems even more active on the first rank that it was on the second.} 42. Bf5 Kf6 {Bringing his majesty into the fray.} 43. Bh7 Kg5 {Among other things, threatening f5.} 44. Bd3 {It's hard to suggest anything better.} Nxe1 {The simplest way.} 45. Rxe1 Rxc3 {Here my opponent resigned. I guess he saw the zugzwang that would arise after 46. Be4 Rc1! when White is simply out of moves. All he can do is shuffle the Bishop on d3 and b1, while I march the King to the h-file, capture the White pawn and then simple advance my h-pawn. I really enjoyed playing this game and I hope you enjoy playing through it. I haven't had such a long sequence of forcing moves leading from apparently equal to worse position to a devastating attack with very few pieces. Also, I'd say the b-pawn was the star player of the game. He got saved in extremis, then he was given a free way to advance and then paralyzed White with just that threat alone. }
