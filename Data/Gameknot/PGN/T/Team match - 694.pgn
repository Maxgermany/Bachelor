1. d4 {queens pawn} d5 {2 d4} 2. c4 {i tried the queens gambit} c5 {they counter gambited} 3. dxc5 {i took there pawn thinking i would exchange queens if they took mine} dxc4 {poke} 4. Qxd8+ {nudge} Kxd8 {now there king has moved no castling can be done  and as i have found recently it is very awkward to stay safe wen my king has moved so early in a game but not impossible} 5. e4 {i went for the center of the board } Be6 {they backed up the outlying pawn fearing the bishop which as far as i can tell the point of a gambit is to mess your opponents structure up wile they try to protect a useless piece id of just left it and pulled my pawn out allowing the queens bishop theres} 6. Nd2 {i threatened the square with a second cover} Nf6 {they threatened my center pawn which is covered by the horse} 7. Ngf3 {i started to play for quick control of the center } Nbd7 {my pawn is threatened } 8. Bxc4 {bishop 4 bishop and pawn for pawn} Bxc4 {slap } 9. Nxc4 {yoink} Nxe4 {blam} 10. Bf4 {i pulled the bishop out not to protect the pawn but to start my attack on there king as it was about to be exposed} Ndxc5 {bam the pawn goes down} 11. O-O-O+ {i castle not to kings side but queens as it puts them in check risky as it allows a fork of the castles but that was unimportant} Kc8 {retreat } 12. Nfe5 {i bring my night forward} Nxf2 {they fork my castles } 13. Nxf7 {i threaten there castle knowing the end is nigh } Rg8 {whoops wrong move  i think id of moved a horse back or a pawn forward and forgot about the castle but there you go the clouds of war can sometimes blind you to the fate that lies  around them the treat is not to the castle but the king himself} 14. Rd8# {checkmate   more annotations may occur soon please if you spent the time reading my commentary can you leave feed back on it or the queens pawn game thank you.}
