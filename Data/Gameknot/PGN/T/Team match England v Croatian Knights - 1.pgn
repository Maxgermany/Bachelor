1. e4 {The Croatian captain was at Wembly, when the Croatian football team beat England, and he was hoping to re-create this upset, by playing a weak side against us. Bad move! I beat my opponent very easily in both games. Here is one of the games } c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {This is all standard open Sicilian } d6 6. Be2 e5 {6. Be2 is playable, but not as aggressive as Bc4 or Bg5. e5 looks like a blunder, as it leave black with a backward pawn on d6, but is known as the Boleslavsky variation, and is quite playable. (It may even be the best move for black in the position, I usually play it, given a chance) } 7. Nb3 Be7 8. Be3 O-O 9. f3 a5 {In most variations black advances the queen side pawns with a6 and b5, but in this variation of the Boleslavsky a5 is best, threatening a4 } 10. g4 {White makes a horrible mistake, ignoring my threat and a wild swipe on the King side. So I carry out my threat. I am out of my opening databases now, none of them include 10.g4 } a4 11. Nd2 a3 12. b3 d5 {And now I am able to play d5, blowing open the centre, and getting rid of my backward pawn.} 13. exd5 {Blacks knights have reached threatening positions, so now he correctly decides to swap one off.} Nb4 14. Nde4 Nfxd5 15. Nxd5 Nxd5 16. Bf2 Qa5+ {If he blocks the check on d2, Bb4 is very strong, so the white king has to move } 17. Kf1 Be6 18. c4 Nf4 19. h4 f5 20. gxf5 Bxf5 21. Ng5 Rad8 {Getting the rook into play with a gain of time } 22. Qc1 Nxe2 23. Kxe2 Bd3+ 24. Ke3 {It is hopeless now for him } Bc5# {One of my few opponents to play it out to the checkmate.}
