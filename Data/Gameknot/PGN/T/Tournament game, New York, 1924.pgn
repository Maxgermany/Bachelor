1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 {White hesitated a little before making this customary move, and I thought the possibility of my playing the Marshall attack might induce him to exchange on B6 and follow with P-Q4, with the idea of producing a favorable end-game though the K-side Pawn majority.} Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O {Castling instead of the customary P-Q3 enables the Marshall attack if White plays 8 P-B3. Black sacrifices a Pawn with 8... P-Q4 9 PxP NxP 10 NxP NxN 11 RxN P-B3. When I played O-O I was really only bluffing and had made up my mind to play the Tarrasch defense should Emanuel Lasker call my bluff with 8 P-B3. } 8. c3 d6 9. h3 {A very important move in this variation, in order to prevent the pin B-N5 which would greatly weaken the effectiveness of the planned advance of the QP.} Na5 10. Bc2 c5 11. d4 Qc7 12. Nbd2 cxd4 {The plan initiated with this move is an early occupation of the QB file with one of my Rooks, taking advantage of the retarded development of the White Q-side.} 13. cxd4 Bd7 14. Nf1 Rfc8 15. Re2 {This move surprised me. I had expected B-Q3, and from the results of another game played with this opening in the same tournament later, that move is probably better.} Nh5 16. dxe5 dxe5 17. Nxe5 Bxh3 18. Nxf7 Be6 19. Ng5 Bc4 {I did not consider any other move here because I thought I was obtaining a clear advantage. Had I seen the reply Emanuel Lasker had prepared I would have considered the alternative 19... BxN 20 BxB Q-K4; this would have brought the Queen to the K-side with tempo and White's game would have been difficult.} 20. Bd3 Rcd8 21. Rc2 {This almost humorous counter-pin I had not taken into consideration. It enables White to "get out from under."} Nf4 22. Bxf4 Qxf4 23. Nh3 Qe5 {White will have a hard time driving me from this dominating square.} 24. Bxc4+ Nxc4 25. Qe2 Rd4 26. f3 {The black squares around White's King are so loosened up that my Bishop should find a fertile field of activity. First, of course, I must double Rooks in the Q file to prevent White from opposing his QR.} Rad8 27. Rac1 {Now White is ready to drive my Knight with P-QN3. In looking around for a good spot for my Knight my conclusion was that only Q7 was really desirable. To enable N-Q7 I would have to play my Bishop to N5 first. I had only about 5 minutes left within which to complete my 30th move, and so I decided to play B-B4 to gain a move in view of the time pressure.} Bc5 28. Kh1 Bb4 29. b3 Nd2 30. Ne3 Ba3 {I made this move just in time to avoid forfeiting the game.} 31. Rd1 {I had to seal my next move, the game being adjourned. Having completed the first 30 moves within the two hours allotted, I had plenty of time to survey the situation. If I played 31... B-N5, White would chase the Bishop to win the Knight. After 32 P-R3 B-R4 33 P-N4 B-B2 34 P-B4, 34... NxP would be my saving move.} Bb4 32. a3 Ba5 33. b4 Bc7 34. f4 {White made the move P-B4 much too fast to suit me, so I looked again carefully to see if there was anything wrong with 34... NxP. After 35 PxQ N-N6 ch 36 K-R2 NxQ White could not play 37 RxR? on account of ... BxP ch and ... NxR. He would have to play 37 RxB RxR 38 NxR RxN. Then 39 N-N5 was not agreeable for me, but 39... R-Q sq 40 R-R7 P-B3 41 N-K6 R-K sq was a likely draw.} Nxe4 {My opponent did not think very long before he made a reply I had not considered and which refuted my combination.} 35. Kh2 {My Queen remained attacked and had no move to keep the Bishop guarded [35... Q-K2 36 N-B5!]} Rd4xd1 36. Nxd1 {Now the Queen must move, and either the Bishop or Knight will be lost.} Qe7 37. Rxc7 {An error of a type Ossip Bernstein used to call the "equalizing injustice of Chess." Emanuel Lasker made the move without a second's hesitation. Evidently he had planned it at the time he played K-R2 and did not bother looking around for other possibilities. With N/Q1-B2 he would have won a whole piece and the game. After winning Knight and Bishop for his Rook, White has by no means an easy ending. In fact, it is doubtful whether this ending can be won at all. [Fischer had not yet been born, but he later phrased it this way: "You have found a good move. Look around for a better one." -- LA]} Qxc7 38. Qxe4 Qc4 39. Qe7 Qc8 {I am trying to keep the Knights from approaching. If 40 N-K3?, 40... R-K sq wins a piece.} 40. Ndf2 {With 40 N-N5 RxN 41 Q-B7 ch K-R sq 42 Q-R5 P-R3 43 QxR PxN 44 Q-R5 ch followed by QxP, White could have produced a Q and P ending with 4 Pawns against 3, but it is highly problematic whether it could have been won.} h6 41. Qa7 Qe6 42. Qb7 Qd5 43. Qb6 {If 44 QxRP, I win the Pawn back with 44... R-QR sq. and the White QNP would soon fall as well.} Rd6 44. Qe3 Re6 45. Qc3 Qc4 46. Qf3 Qc6 47. Qd3 Rd6 48. Qb3+ Qd5 49. Qb1 Re6 {I now threaten to attack the QRP with ... R-K6. 50 N-Q3 is not a satisfactory defense because after 50... R-K7 51 N/R3-B2 R-R7 52 Q-QB sq Q-B5 the Pawn falls after all. White therefore decides to take a chance and sacrifice his Knight on R6 in order to lay bare my King and attack with the Q, the remaining Knight and the two connected passed Pawns.} 50. Ng4 Re2 51. Nxh6+ gxh6 52. Qg6+ Kf8 53. Qxh6+ Ke8 54. Qg6+ Kd8 {White could now draw with perpetual check, checking on the seventh and eighth rows until I interpose my Rook or Queen, thus relinquishing my mate threat.} 55. Qg3 {Now I saw a chance to avoid perpetual check while maintaining the mating threat with my Rook.} Re8 56. Qf2 Rg8 57. Qb2 Qd6 {This guards the King against checks and at the same time keeps the Knight from approaching as long as the KBP is not protected.} 58. Qc3 Kd7 59. Qf3 Kc7 60. Qe4 Rg7 61. Qf5 Re7 {I cannot prevent the Knight from occupying N5 any longer and therefore go ahead after the White QRP.} 62. Ng5 Re3 63. Ne4 Qe7 64. Nf6 Kb8 65. g3 Rxa3 66. Kh3 Ra1 {Of course not QxP as this would allow perpetual check through 67 Q-K5 K-N2 68 Q-Q5 etc.} 67. Nd5 Rh1+ 68. Kg2 Qh7 {White is now forced to exchange as he has only one check and his King would not be able to stand the combined attack of Rook and Queen.} 69. Qxh7 Rxh7 70. Kf3 Kb7 71. g4 Kc6 72. Ke4 Rh8 {My plan is, of course, to drive the Knight first and then to advance the RP to clear the way for the NP. I am threatening check on K sq winning the Knight, so the latter must now move. } 73. Ne3 Re8+ 74. Kd4 Rd8+ 75. Ke4 a5 76. bxa5 b4 77. a6 {77 P-N5?? would lose to 77... P-N6 78 N-B4 K-B4 79 N-N2 R-Q7 80 N-Q3 ch K-B5 81 N-K5 ch K-B6!} Kc5 {Had I realized that White had a chance to draw, I would have looked much more into the variations arising from 77... P-N6. I only figured ahead as far as 78 N-B4 K-N4 79 N-N2 KxP 80 K-K3 K-N4 81 P-N5 K-N5 82 P-N6 K-B6 83 N-R4 K-B7 84 P-B5. I analyzed it again after the game and concluded Black could win if he attacks the Knight [which keeps his Pawn from advancing] with R-QR sq. after first getting White's King to the 4th rank so the Knight is captured with check. This led me to claim that after 84 P-B5, 84 R-K sq ch  85 K-B3 R-KB sq would seal White's fate. If after 86 K-B4 R-QR sq White plays 87 N-N6 he does not get a Queen at all. But White need not play 86 K-B4: he can draw with 86 P-N7! RxP ch 87 K-N4 R-B8 89 K-N5, winning the Rook in the end.} 78. a7 b3 79. Nd1 Ra8 {The only chance to win. 79... K-N3 would be answered with 80 K-K3 KxP 81 N-N2 K-N3 82 P-B5 K-B4 83 P-B6.} 80. g5 Rxa7 81. g6 Rd7 82. Nb2 Rd2 83. Kf3 Rd8 {Obviously I cannot take the Knight as White's NP would Queen. But I can win both Pawns, and I thought I still saw a possibility of winning the game.} 84. Ke4 Rd2 85. Kf3 Rd8 86. Ke4 Kd6 87. Kd4 Rc8 88. g7 {In order to force the Rook to get off the Bishop file so that the White King can approach my Pawn.} Ke6 89. g8=Q+ Rxg8 90. Kc4 Rg3 {This is the move I had calculated would win my game after all.} 91. Na4 Kf5 92. Kb4 Kxf4 {It would take White 3 more moves, I had calculated, to capture the Pawn: K-R3, N-B5 and NxP. But at that moment my King would reach the square QB5 and the Knight would be lost because the Rook pins it! It never occurred to me that White need not capture the Pawn at all and could still draw the game. Emanuel Lasker actually discovered a new end-game position in which a R and P cannot win against a Knight, and this position has since become a classic.} 93. Nb2 {Examining the position carefully, I soon realized I had no way of driving White's King away. However, if I could reach Q7 with my King by playing him in back of my Rook, I could still win. I made a last attempt.} Ke4 94. Na4 Kd4 95. Nb2 Rf3 96. Na4 Re3 97. Nb2 Ke4 98. Na4 Kf3 99. Ka3 {This foils my plan. After ...K-K7 White would play K-N2 and I could never approach.} Ke4 100. Kb4 Kd4 101. Nb2 Rh3 102. Na4 Kd3 103. Kxb3 Kd4+ {We agreed to a draw. I felt quite discouraged, naturally, at seeing the win slip through my hands after more than thirteen hours of hard struggle. But when the excitement had subsided I came to regard this game as one of my best efforts.}
