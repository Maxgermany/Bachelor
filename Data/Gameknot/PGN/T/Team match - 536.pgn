1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Bd3 {not the usual lines. basically, I think that not following the main lines in openings is not so good - especially for low rated players. I think one should go with the rules that grater has seen and annotated before. In a game of low rated players it will be hard to prove ones strength in positional play when you go out of theory so early in the game.} c5 {I dont know the theory says here but it seems to me that d:e4 B:e4 Kf6 makes the Bishop move another move and that's 3 moves with the same piece in the early opening. that can't be good for white.} 4. Bb5+ {second move with the same piece. exd5 exd5 dxc5 Bxc5 and to play against the isolated pawn seems reasonable.} Nc6 5. Nf3 Bd7 {5... dxe4 6. Ng4 Nf6 etc. should be checked carefuly. it might be a good choice for black.} 6. O-O Bd6 {I dont like that move. e5 is a problem for black.} 7. Be3 {why not e5? after 7... Be7 8. c3 f6 9. exf6 Nxf6 10. Re1 - there are problems for black.} a6 8. Bxc6 {a must. going back with the bishop seems to be bad.} Bxc6 9. e5 Bc7 10. c3 {white managed to pass e5 and to create a chain of soldiers. it looks good.} cxd4 11. Nxd4 {I dont get it. is there a tactical punch that I'm missing? why leaving the e5 pawn helpless?} Ne7 {now I saw it. 11.... Bxe5 12. Nxe6!? fxe6 13. Qh5+ g6 14. Qxe5 Qf6. is that realy that bad?} 12. Nd2 O-O 13. Bf4 Ng6 {White's tactical tryout made the e5 pawn a target for attack. its true it can be protected but the question is: for how long?} 14. Nxc6 bxc6 15. Qg4 Bxe5 {and the pawn goes - with white's small advantage.} 16. Bxe5 Nxe5 17. Qg3 Ng6 {after it clears - Black is a pawn up and there is a great center play for him. white is a bit out of the game...} 18. Nf3 Rb8 19. b3 Qf6 {Black is pressing on white's weak points: firdt b2 and now c3.} 20. Rac1 Rb7 21. Rfe1 Rfb8 {the plan is good. there has to be a try to push the a pawn or the c pawn or both.} 22. Nd4 Rb7b6 {?? c5 is needed.} 23. Nxc6 {a free pawn...} Rxc6 {???????? a blunder.} 24. Qxb8+ {}
