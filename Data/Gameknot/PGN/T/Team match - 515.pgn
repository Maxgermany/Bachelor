1. b4 {The Battle of Dontru7 II. I opened with my trusted Sokolsky, an opening that I've played OTB since 2007 (USCF rating of 1820). } e5 2. Bb2 Bxb4 3. Bxe5 Nf6 4. Nf3 O-O 5. e3 d5 6. c4 Re8 7. Be2 Nc6 8. Bb2 Be6 9. cxd5 Nxd5 10. O-O Qe7 11. a3 {I've seen this position dozens of times. Mhy opponents usually get very excited at this point believing they have an advantage. } Bd6 12. Nc3 Nxc3 13. Bxc3 Rad8 14. Qc2 Bg4 15. Rfb1 b6 16. Qa4 {I've found a weak spot. } Ne5 17. Nxe5 Bxe2 {Inaccurate.} 18. Nc6 {It took a half dozen variations before I saw the material gain. } Qd7 19. Qd4 {This gains the tempo to win the material. } f6 20. Nxd8 Rxd8 21. Qh4 Bd3 22. Rbc1 Qf5 23. f3 Bb5 24. a4 {Rushing my pawns to open up files. } Ba6 25. a5 Bb7 26. e4 Qg6 27. axb6 axb6 28. Ra7 Bc6 {I completely missed the Bxf6, gxf6, Rook x c6 combination. } 29. Rca1 {I want to trade off the rook but I have to get the white bishiop out of the way. } Re8 30. d3 {Worried about combos that open me up. } Qf7 31. d4 Qc4 32. Bb2 Qe2 33. Qf2 {This move should lose since dontru has Bxh2 check. Luckily, he rewarded my bad move with one of his own. } Qxf2+ 34. Kxf2 {From here the grind begins. } Kf7 35. Ba3 Re7 {Now I get his rook off. } 36. Bxd6 cxd6 37. Rxe7+ Kxe7 {I pick up one more pawn now. Can you see it?} 38. Ra6 Bd7 39. Rxb6 h6 40. g3 g6 41. e5 {forces pawn trades. } fxe5 42. dxe5 dxe5 43. Rxg6 h5 44. Rg5 e4 {I should have just taken the e pawn. Instead, this inaccuracy allows the game to last a bit longer. } 45. Rxh5 exf3 46. Rh7+ Ke6 47. Rxd7 Kxd7 48. Kxf3 Ke6 49. h4 Kf5 50. g4+ Kg6 51. Ke4 Kh6 52. Ke5 Kg6 {You know, I still wasn't sure how to finish this game. I figure the g-pawn has to hit the 7th first, right? Luckily my opponent saved me from having to make hard decisions and possibly an embarrassing draw. } 53. g5 Kh5 54. Kf6 Kxh4 55. g6 Kh5 56. g7 Kh6 57. g8=Q {}
