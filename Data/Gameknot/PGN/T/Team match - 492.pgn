1. b4 Nf6 2. Bb2 Nc6 {My favourite opening. This is the standard response from black.} 3. b5 Na5 {Forcing the knight to the edge of the board. The game is still being played by the book.} 4. d4 {Trying to grab some control over the centre.} Nc4 {The knight cuts back in.} 5. Qc1 {Defends the bishop.} g6 {Prepares to fianchetto his bishop.} 6. Nd2 d5 {A swap looks ominous.} 7. f3 {Preparing for e4. Usually I wouldn't move the weak spot but I don't feel threatened by his bishops orqueen so I feel comfortable in playing it.} Ne3 8. Nh3 Bh6 {Both sides continuing to develop pieces.} 9. a4 Bf5 {Threatening ...Nc2.} 10. g4 {Attacking the bishop.} Bxc2 {Plays with bishop insted to make sure that it is safe from the e2 f3 g4 pawn chain.} 11. g5 {Forking the bishop and knight.} Bf5 {Threatening ...Nc2 again.} 12. gxh6 {I win the bishop.} Qd6 13. Ba3 {Forcing the queen to move.} Qd7 14. Ng5 {I get a nice little outpost for my knight. Nc2 is staring him right in the face. Why won't he play it? All comments welcome.} Ng8 15. h4 {I'm a little bit worried about the h3 square. That's why I play this move. Just to get another defender.} Nc2+ {Finally he plays it!} 16. Kd1 Nxa1 17. Qxa1 {We are level in terms of material now.} Nf6 {Brings his knighty back into the game. Why did he move it in the first place? I thought he was trying to force the knight to retreat. But he never played f6. He's probably still wary about e4.} 18. e4 {The black queen could blast straight through to my king if I'm not careful.} dxe4 19. fxe4 {We swap. I have full central control now.} Nxe4 {He takes. Interesting move. I wouldn't have played it.} 20. Ngxe4 Bxe4 21. Nxe4 {I win a piece but lose a pawn. I think I'm on top easily with my position.} Qg4+ {Ah, I see why he played Nxe4 now. He goes up a pawn.} 22. Be2 Qxe4 23. Re1 {Everything is coming together for me now. I have an almost free passage straight to his king.} Qd5 24. Bg4 {All my pieces are in position now. Time to begin the siege.} f5 25. Rxe7+ {First move of the attack.} Kd8 {If he had of played f8 I would have played Re5 check and win his queen.} 26. Qc3 {Threatening checkmate. Ignoring the threat on the bishop.} Rc8 {To be expected. If anyone sees a better move that he could have played please comment.} 27. Bf3 {Forcing the queen away. The queen can't do anything to defend his king now. I also win his rook with this move as well.} Qg8 28. Bxb7 {Everything is in place now. Time to finish him off.} c5 {Delaying the inevitable.} 29. Bxc5 Qa2 {His queen prepares to throw in a few useless checks.} 30. Bxc8 {Not caring about his queen I take his rook.} Qb1+ {The first of the checks.} 31. Kd2 Qa2+ 32. Kc1 {He can't check me without losing his queen now.} Qxa4 33. Bd6 {Preparing for the final strike.} Qxb5 34. Qc7# {And gameover. I hope you enjoyed watching this game. I can tell you I certainly enjoyed playing it.}
