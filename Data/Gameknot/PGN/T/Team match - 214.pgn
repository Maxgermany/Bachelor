[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {Bishop's opening of the king's pawn game.} Nf6 {The old four move blocked--Berlin defense.} 3. Nf3 Bd6 {Nc6 is the most common response, but I like this.} 4. Nc3 Na6 {The knight here is not so great.  BxN doubles black's pawns.} 5. Ng5 O-O {This is wrong.  Better would be Nd5.  While white has a pawn, bishop, and knight attacking that square, black needs to protect against Nxf7.  Black stands to lose a pawn and bishop for nothing here.  While white could take the black knight (Nd5), Ng5 is undefended--Qxg5.  On second thought, Nxf7, Rxf7, Bxf7.  White trades a bishop and knight (six points) for a rook (5 points).  Black comes out ahead in this exchange.  I change my mind--this is a decent move.} 6. Qg4 {? Even without NxQ, this move does not appear to confer any tactical advantage.  The response to Nxf7+ would be Qe7.  NxB+, Kh8, Nf5.  This does give white a pawn and bishop, but these are not worth the queen.} Nxg4 7. h3 {While this opens white's h file (attacking the black king's fortress), the attack works best with a queen.  Without her, white is trading a pawn and knight for a knight.  Now that white is down nine points, every trade benefits black.} Qxg5 8. hxg4 Qxg4 9. g3 Nb4 {Qf3 would also have been good.  Nb4 is probably better.  If the white knight was not protecting Pe4, Qxe4+ would yield Rh1.  If white does not defend Pc2, Nxc2+ gives up Ra1.  White almost certainly recognizes the threat.  10. Bd3 Nxd3.  11. Pxd3 doubles white's pawns.  White will probably opt for Bb3, which also exerts greater control over the center.} 10. Bb3 b6 11. a3 Na6 12. Nb5 {White withdraws protection from Pe4?  This blunder results in the loss of Rh1 as previously noted.  Six free points for black--a 16 point material advantage.} Qxe4+ 13. Kd1 Qxh1+ 14. Ke2 Nc5 {I think I like Ba6 better, which (temporarily) pins the white knight.  White can counter with Pc4, though.  Bb7 is also promising, as it permits Qf3+ followed by Bc5.  The queen can mop up king side pawns.} 15. Bd5 {While this move threatens Ra8, it is a hollow threat since QxBd5 for free.} c6 {OMG no!  This results in BxQ.  Black cannot touch the knight without BxR, undoing black's enormous advantage.  ROYAL BLUNDER!  Plus black's black bishop is also undefended.} 16. Bxh1 Ba6 {While this move pins the knight, white can counter with Pc4.} 17. c4 cxb5 {This removes the threat to the bishop, but opens up BxRa8.  My bet is white trades the bishop for a black rook.} 18. Bxa8 {Sure enough.  I would have done the same in a heartbeat.  White's enormous material advantage is evaporating.} Rxa8 19. d3 Nb3 {Still up eight points, the knight/bishop trade is highly advised.} 20. Rb1 f5 21. Bg5 e4 22. Rd1 bxc4 {Ill advised.  Pxe4 and black cannot defend Bd6, meaning the bishop must move which exposes Pd7 (Rxd7).  White gains a pawn.} 23. dxc4 {Pdxe4 means black can move c3+, followed by Pxb2.  This prevents the Rx scenario described in the previous move, so... never mind.  White down 8 points translates to few good options.} Bc5 {?  Bxc4+ is the obvious response.  The bishop could move later.  On the other hand, white cannot protect Pc4--it will perish soon enough.} 24. Rxd7 Bxc4+ 25. Kd1 {Ke1 protects Pf2.  Not sure why white chose Kd1 instead.} Bxf2 {Black should win two pawns, unless white counter threats.} 26. Rc7 {There is the counter threat.} Rd8+ {I like Bd3 better.  The pawn and bishop pair become just about invincible.} 27. Kc2 Rd3 {What?  Why toss Bc4? Black ignores white's counter threat against the white bishop.  I like Bd5 MUCH better.  It protects the knight, while the rook protects the bishop.  White can have the a7 pawn--it is cheaper than black's white bishop.} 28. Rxc4 b5 29. Rc8+ Kf7 30. Rc7+ Kg6 31. Bf4 {Smart choice.} a5 32. Rb7 a4 {Yes--LET white take Pb5.  Black dares.  Black DOUBLE dares.} 33. Rxb5 {Blunder.  Nd4+ gives black the white rook for free.  Five points no charge.} e3 {BLUNDER!  That pawn was all black had protecting Rd3.  Nd4+ and black gets white's rook for nothing.  Now instead Kxd3 for nothing, followed by BxPe3.} 34. Rb6+ {I guess Kxd3 can wait, though forcing the black king closer to the battlefield is not wise.} Kh5 35. Ra6 {BLUNDER!  KxRd3 for free!  The rook is just standing there with its trousers draped around its ankles!  Begging to be taken!} Rd2+ 36. Kb1 Rd1+ 37. Kc2 e2 38. Rxa4 Nd4+ 39. Kc3 e1=Q+ 40. Kc4 Qe2+ 41. Kc5 {Now here black likes Qb5+ which gives up the white rook.  Qc2+ does the same, since the king cannot move to b5 because the knight is covering that square.} Ne6+ {Nope.  Though the king is checked by both knight and bishop, white retains the rook.} 42. Kc6 Nd8+ 43. Kc7 Qc2+ {There you go.} 44. Kb8 Qxa4 45. Kc7 Qc6+ {Excellent choice.} 46. Kb8 Qb7# {}
