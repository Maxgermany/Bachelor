1. e4 {I was playing white, the game was pretty even, until I picked up a loose pawn, I like end games and would guess my ration of conversion is about 70%.  You have to plan far ahead but I like it} c5 2. Bc4 {I know - Knights before bishops, however if it is going to come out eventually its all the same} e6 3. Nc3 {1st} a6 4. Nf3 {2 out} b5 5. Be2 {forcing the withdrawal} Bb7 6. d3 {defending} Nc6 7. d4 {looking for trouble} d6 8. Be3 {enforcing - looks like Kevin does not want to exchange} g6 9. a3 {i did not want him to play b4, I liked my knight there} Bg7 10. dxc5 {stopping b4 for now} dxc5 11. Qxd8+ {Trading queens} Nxd8 12. Bxc5 {picking up the winning pawn} Nf6 13. Bd3 {?? dont know thing i wanted to open up e4} Nd7 {he saw it} 14. Bd4 {forcing the trade} Bxd4 15. Nxd4 {done} O-O 16. O-O-O {castles} Nc5 17. Nf3 {could not go forward, wanted to wait for the time to trade} f5 18. Rhe1 {i did not like the thought of opening the f file for him, i wanted to get my king side pawns on line} Nxd3+ 19. Rxd3 {So he trades and i take the file} Nc6 20. e5 {starting with the pawn} Rad8 21. Red1 {trying to get the full trade} Rxd3 22. Rxd3 {no choice} Rd8 23. Rxd8+ {I wanted to trade on d8, this took his knight out and he would have to waste a move to get it back, getting my pawns in line} Nxd8 24. Ne1 {making room for f4 and defending c2} Nc6 25. f4 {done} Nd4 26. g3 {done, i basicly made his bishop a bad bishop without targets, now to trade to a pawn and king endgame} Kf7 27. Kd2 {activating the king} Nc6 28. Ke3 {staying on black} b4 29. axb4 {accepting the trade} Nxb4 30. Kd4 {i thought he wanted to play be4, which could not have worked but it would force me to move pawns soon...} Nd5 31. Nxd5 {trade accepted} Bxd5 32. c4 {I 1st wanted to play b4 to set up c5 and blocked his a pawn, but though I would have time later} Be4 33. Nd3 {offering the trade, which I knew I could force soon} Ke7 34. Nc5 {he could not defend the pawn and the bishop} a5 35. Nxe4 {taking the trade, now b4 is of the line} fxe4 36. Kxe4 {Here i feel I should have played b3, locking his pawn down and even if he plays e3 I can still take with the king, even though it is further away from the pawns he stil has to move Kd7 due to my pawn on e5} Kd7 37. b3 {at last a pawn string} Kc6 38. Kd4 {expected moves} Kb6 39. Kc3 {I new he was heading for c5 to force some pawn movements, i calculated...} Kc5 40. g4 {locking his pawns down to force his king out} h6 41. h3 {saving (h4) one move for incase i have to waste a move} Kc6 {Zugzwang what ever he does I can lock down and with h4 force him out of c5 - dont know if he saw this but he retreated} 42. b4 {the passed pawn is not past because the pawns on b & c4 locks down his king and leaves my king to hunt his pawn down} axb4+ 43. Kxb4 {now to get the king infront of the pawn} g5 44. fxg5 {just locking it down} hxg5 45. c5 {pushing the pawn, I thought if he went back I could move forward and move my king to d6 to take on e 6 and add pressure with a second passed pawn} Kd5 46. Kb5 {THis was even better} Kxe5 47. c6 {pushing} Kf4 48. c7 {pushing} e5 49. c8=Q {queen} e4 50. Qf5+ {my best move was this, g3 loses the pawn so i forced the king in front of the pawn winning a tempo} Ke3 51. Kc4 {leaves only d & e 2, both loses the pawn, my opponent resigned}
