1. e4 e6 {This being a blitz game, of course, there's going to be errors.   If they're half as wild as what happened in the game, I'd love to see what we missed!} 2. d4 d5 {I play the French as black, so this suited me.} 3. Nd2 c5 {A bit earlier than usual?   I play Nf6 here in this line.   I think it all transposes anyway.} 4. c3 Nc6 5. Ngf3 {This isn't absolutely mainline; the knight usually goes to e2, allowing the other knight to go to f3 and prepare for a strong defence of the d4 pawn.   This is part of a gambit line I picked up off an openings DVD.   Unfortunately, I later overheard the presenter of the DVD discussing the line as (and I paraphrase) "good for white if it's accepted, which is why it's never accepted".   Still, for the one time that it is accepted, I'm ready!} Be7 6. Bd3 Nf6 7. e5 Nd7 {With Qb6 in instead of Be7, this is the gambit line.   The d-pawn is doomed, but white ignores that and continues 8. O-O cxd   9. cxd NxP   10. NxP QxP   11. Nf3! Qb6   12. Qa4 (pinning the knight with the intention of making things quite awkward for an undeveloped black) Qb4 (looking to swap off)   13. Qc2 Qc5   14. Qe2.   Now the black bishop and rook are prepared to come into the game with tempo on the queen, and black is still struggling to get his pieces out.   Two players have played this line against me on gameknot, and I won in 27 and 23 moves despite being 70 and 150 points out-rated.} 8. O-O b6 {Presuambly a bit worried about castling kingside with the f6 knight kicked and pieces pointing that way.   It's still ok to castle (8...O-O 9. Bxh7+? KxB 10. NxB+ BxN 11. Qh5+ Bh6 - the Greek gift doesn't work), provided care is taken.   Black can go for an f6 break straight after.   The text is a bit slow.} 9. Re1 Bb7 10. a4 {I figured he was lining up for queenside castling, so I said I'd give him something to think about as early as possible.   I find that in the French in particular, it can be hard to get a plan going until Black has committed his king to one side or the other (a centre-break isn't really on).   Had I a better plan here?} Qc7 11. b3 {b4 is too well defended, of course, so I need to get more suppose for my pawns, starting with a Ba3.} O-O-O 12. Ba3 h5 {So far, the game's been going all my way.   Now black indicates he wants to play a bit too.} 13. b4 {This costs a pawn, though at the expense of opening up the c-file to queen and king.   I played it more on instinct - being a short time-control game - than analysis.   There are tricks though - after 13...cxb 14. cxb NxB 15. Rc1 Nc6??, the e7 bishop hangs.   If instead 15...Bc6, 16. Ba6+ Kb8 17. Nb1 covers the rook fork (...Nd3) and prepares Nb1-c3-b5.  Anyways, black turned down the pawn offer, so all the above was redundant.} Rdg8 14. bxc5 bxc5 15. Bb5 {I don't want the bishop getting shut in after a c4 push.} g5 16. Nb3 {The f-knight needs a square.   The text also builds up a bit of pressure on c5.   After stuff like 16...c4, I think I have 17. BxN BexB (not often that differentiation is needed!   If the other bishop is taken, I have BaxB) 18. BxB+ QxB 19. RxB PxN  20. RxP and I'm a pawn up with the initiative (black's queen is hit) and the better king safety.} g4 17. Nfd2 h4 {Earlier, I had thought my attack would break through first, but now I wasn't at all sure!   Still, nothing I can do about it yet.   Hack on with my attack is best.   I didn't like 18. NxP though - 18...NxP 19. BxN BxB 20. PxB and the c-file that I'm trying to open now has my own doubled pawns on it.   I'm not sure how else I can continue my attack though, and amn't that happy with my next move.} 18. a5 g3 19. hxg3 hxg3 20. fxg3 Rxg3 21. a6 {And this seems to actually help black; I'm closing things up, and the bishop at a8 will defend happily and maybe hope to get a look along the long diagonal at some later stage.   Meanwhile, my king is getting quite open.} Ba8 22. Nxc5 {I think this sums up where I am at the moment - playing moves I turned down previously.   If let, I'm eyeing b7.} Qd8 {Black ignores me and looks to bring the queen to join the two rooks.   It looks natural, but I'm not sure it's right.   Now after Nb7, the c6 knight is hanging, so taking may be forced, which removes my a-pawn from my way.  However, maybe black can give up his c6 knight.   After 23. Nb7 Qg8!?   24. Re2 Qh7   25. Kf2 Qh2   26. Qg1, the c6 square feels miles away.   I don't think the knight is worth the g2 pawn.} 23. Nb7 Bxb7 {However, he takes, to my relief.} 24. axb7+ Kxb7 25. Bxc6+ {Other moves (e.g. Qh4, Rb1, Qb3) may be too slow.   Or may end up similar; not entirely sure!   This at least keeps up the checks.} Kxc6 26. Qa4+ Kb7 {Black had a bit of an aul think here; I didn't see his next move though (partly because of the time control obviously; I just played the obvious because it looked right)} 27. Rab1+ {The other rook may have been better - leaving the a-rook and the queen to gang up on the a7 pawn - but I had it in my mind that the e-rook was soon to be needed at e2 in a defensive capacity.   But after 27. Reb1+ Nb6 28. BxB QxB 29. QxP+, I pick up black's queen.   Maybe a similar sac as in the game would have been on for black.} Nb6 28. Bc5 {Have to remove the defender.} Bxc5 {More to free up the d8-h4 diagonal for the queen than to remove the bishop.} 29. dxc5 Rxg2+ {An ! for black here, I think.   There's a lot of checks coming; I have to be very careful.   The slower 29...Rhg8 may fail to 30. Re2 Qg5 31. Qd7+ Ka8 32. Qc6+ Kb8 33. RxN+! PxR 34. QxP+ and I've a draw anyway, and a win given any tempo to get in c6.} 30. Kxg2 Qg5+ {I'm rook for pawn up, both knights are hanging and black is on a king-hunt.} 31. Kf1 {31. Kf2 allows QxN with check.   Kf3 seems to be asking too much after 31...Rh3+} Rh1+ 32. Ke2 {It's possible black felt he didn't have time to take my knight because of his own weak knight - I'm threatening the curious Qd7+, with the queen immune from capture as the knight is pinned.   Black may need to keep up the checks, and material be damned.} Qh5+ 33. Nf3 Rh2+ {And, similarly, a pinned knight allows black a move I hadn't considered.   I'm fairly sure Nf3 was still correct though.   But I thought I had everything covered until black played this.} 34. Ke3 {Anything else hangs the knight with check.} Qh6+ 35. Kd3 {The knight is doing sterling work, now preventing Q (or R)d2#.   With black a rook down, his knight unable to join the action and his two major pieces struggling to get in at my king, black may have to settle for perpetual here.   If he can find it.   Meanwhile, with the knight hanging, I can sac a fair bit of material to end the checks.} Qg6+ {Here, Kd4 loses the queen, though black's rook and knight are both hanging!   (A sample line may be 36. Kd4 Qg4+ 37. Ke3 QxQ 38. NxR Qe4+ and there's chances of picking up the knight or the important c5-pawn - saving black's knight - with checking forks).   After Ke3, we seem to have perpetual.   I don't think black was expecting my next move though.} 36. Re4 {!!   The checks are over, and with black's knight hanging, I'll come out of the exchanges material up.   A swap off will remove black's queen as well, and if black doesn't want to swap, he can't stop Qd7+ (or Qe8+ if the king moves back).   After 36...Qg2 37. PxN, I have all the checking squares on the second rank covered.   And again, stuff like 36...Qg2 37. PxN PxR+ 38. QxP+ and I think black is getting mated.   Don't anyone dare refute this move! :)} dxe4+ 37. Qxe4+ Qxe4+ 38. Kxe4 Rc2 {I've always enjoyed how, in Tal v Hecht from the Varna Olympiad (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1139582), all Tal's wild sacs are ultimately just to reach a technically won - but not straightforward - endgame.   I don't for an instant pretend to be a Tal, but I do like how I've emulated him ever so slightly here!   There's still a long way to go to bring home the point though; black has decent drawing chances.   Tal's achieved endgame was easier to win!} 39. Kd3 Rf2 40. Nd4 {Covering f5 and so helping support the e5-pawn for now.} Rh2 41. cxb6 {The knight falls, having stood pinned and hanging for 12 moves.} axb6 42. Nb5 {Eyeing the d6 square and the f7 pawn.} Rh3+ 43. Kc4 Kc6 44. Nd6 {A bit of a bot√∫n here; I missed that black can now play f5 without fear of capture} Rh4+ 45. Kb3 Rf4 {Black missed it too, fortunately!} 46. Rd1 {Stopping the f-pawn's advance to an extent - I can take without hanging my knight.  Though 46...f5 is probably still good for black here - I think I need at least one pawn to win, and PxPep leaves me with just the one.   Possibly I could try centralising with 47. Rd4; if black takes, my pawns are re-connected, and my knight is much stronger.   Any other move may let me gain space with Rc4+, forcing the king back.   Or perhaps, better was just Nc4} Rf2 47. Rd4 b5 {??   Black needed that pawn.} 48. Rb4 Rf4 {??} 49. Rxf4 {A shame of a way to end a highly entertaining game.   But such is the way of blitz at times.}
