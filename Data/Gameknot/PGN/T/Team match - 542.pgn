1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Opening moves, My opponent had chosen Scillian Defence Najdorf Variation which i am not much comfortable with..} 6. Bc4 {I wanted to control a2-f7 diagonel with my Bishop, Hoping a future attack on f7 square or pin f7 square after he castles} g6 {hmm.. My opponent has chosen to fiancetto his dark bishop on g7. It seems i will have to be careful on dark squares on this game. He wants to control dark squares.} 7. O-O Bg7 8. Bg5 {I didnt want him to play e6 which strenghts f7 square.Also i thought i might want to change my Bishop on g5 with his Knight on f6 in the thought of controling the light squares.} O-O 9. Re1 {Centerilizing my rook..} Nbd7 {I was expecting Nc6. But my opponent had some good plans..} 10. Qd2 {developing my queen and conneting my rooks..} Ne5 {!! Here I have to make a choice either i will stay on the a2-g8 diagonal or i will take my move back..Good move from my opponent. He centerilized his Knight on e5 and i had to retreat my Bishop losing one tempo.. But luckily it s not the end yet.. } 11. Be2 {I wanted to control the squares this evil Knight can go with my Bishop.  } Bd7 {He might have played b5 first than fianchetto his light colored Bishop in the direct attacking position on my king-side. } 12. Rad1 Rc8 {"Rc8" Very naturel move from my opponent. He wants to use half open file for rooks on behalf of black king.} 13. Bxf6 {Here I wanted to exchange some material as i felt some pressure because of his Knight that resides on e5, But I wanted to put my Knight on d5 first. This move might be bad because it turns black's dark square Bishop to a monster because after giving up my Bishop he can dance on the long diagonal as he likes} Bxf6 14. Nd5 Bg7 {He doesnt want to exchange his strong bishop with my centerilized Knight because he wanted to do that with his other bishop. } 15. f4 {So it is time to get rid of that Knight from the center..} Nc4 16. Bxc4 {I didnt want to retreat my queen to c1 to defend my pawn. ı t would be real bad duty for excelancy:P nor i wanted to lose a pawn So i exchanged my Bishop} Rxc4 17. c3 {Again I dont wanna lose a pawn, I started to feel his Bishop's strenght... But luckily his queen and rook on f8 arent doing much here. } e5 {I have missed this move.He s attacking to my Knight and giving me some hard time. But it weakens the d6 pawn. And d5 is a good outpost for my Knights} 18. Nf3 Bh6 {Pinning my pawn. Another attacking move. But wait a second what s his rook on f8 doing here? wouldnt it better if he played on Re8! Certainly! it would be naturel move. Developing the rook towards to center..} 19. b3 {19-b3 Attacking the rook. I think Qd3 would do it better . And I could save my pawn from the pin.} Rc6 20. c4 Be6 {Here I guess 20-b5 would be better.. after  20-...b5 , 21-Nb4 Bxf3 , 22-Nxc6 Bxd2 , 23 Nxd8 Bxe1, 24 Nxe1 Rxd8 25 Rxd6 ... Material would be even and it would be end game Rook+Bishop versus Rook+Knight.. Actually I would have the advantage because of the pin on his bishop on d7. But didnt calculate further.} 21. Qb4 {Wanted to find good suare for my queen and it was b4. She could have an eye on d6 and and b6 square that his queen can come with a check.} Bxd5 {so he didnt like my Knight there. Well positioned knight values rook. So he did a good job.} 22. Rxd5 {Here I didnt want to lose outpost square d5. Also pinning the his weak pawn on d6} Bxf4 {I am down a pawn and have to do sth to gain it back.} 23. g3 {This is the move will get rid of the Bishop and leave e4 pawn for my Knight..} Bh6 24. Nxe5 Qb6+ {He could play Rb6 and after Qa5  then simply Bg7 attacking the Knight! Qb6 loses immediately after QxQ followed by Nd7!} 25. Qxb6 Rxb6 26. Nd7 Rc6 27. Nxf8 Kxf8 28. Red1 Be3+ 29. Kg2 Bc5 30. e5 dxe5 31. Rxe5 b6 32. g4 Rf6 33. Rd2 {Here I could just play 33-g5 because after 33 .. Rf2+  ı would play Kg3 then if he takes my pawn as a nice morsel Rd8 followed by Re8 and Rg8 mate. he would have big trouble cause of that. I missed it.} a5 34. g5 {Here i saw mating attack it but it s too late for that.} Rf4 {I could play g3 with the same idea of mating threat} 35. Rd8+ Kg7 36. Kg3 Rf5 37. Rxf5 gxf5 38. Kf4 Bg1 39. h4 {I guess after this move my opponent felt he doesnt have a chance at all, so  he resigned.}
