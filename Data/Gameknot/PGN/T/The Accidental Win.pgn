1. f3 {Oh I'm so proud of this one, even if the finish was somewhat fortuitous!} e5 2. Kf2 {Thematic opening to this point.....} Bc5+ 3. e3 d5 {I do play the Abdicatalan on occasion, not overly used to attacking it though} 4. c3 Be6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 {At this stage white prob has the better development. I'm also concious that the Baron probably remembers some comments I made on another annotation and is gunning for me big style *grins*} Bd6 7. Nc3 Ne7 {So I play for space rather than time, letting him have the tempo but forcing him to do the work.} 8. g3 c5 9. Bh3 {I thought here about bxb but the counter take is obvious so I thought why should I help him develop. Chose deliberately to semi open the f file instead.} O-O 10. Bxe6 fxe6 11. Nh3 Nbc6 {Although this looks like an attacking move I'm still trying to play defensive (I'm just not very good at it)} 12. f4 {That was a surprise to me, I expected him to do summat about the d pawn.} cxd4 13. exd4 {Now he has an isolated pawn and I'm wondering what I can do about it....} Nf5 14. Be3 {Forced to swap a bishop for a knight....yeah sounds good to me.} Nxe3 15. Kxe3 Qd7 {Can't rem why I did that, although having played the next move I can... I was trying to be sneaky and advance the pawn hoping Baron might forget about the knight on h3.} 16. Qg4 {Unfortunately he ain't that bad. This one gave me a few nervous moments as the Baron is a Keres type, attacks appear out of nowhere and my kingside isn't that strong.} Rad8 {Still angling after e5} 17. a3 {Not sure of his rationale for this one, appears out of character for him..} Rf6 {Trying to shift the queen..} 18. Kd3 {Another odd move...} Rg6 19. Qe2 Bc7 {I wanted to do e5 here, but it left d5 very vulnerable, so backed that one up first} 20. Rhe1 e5 {Decided on this despite it being quite risky imho, it seemed like the right thing to do. Baron can't do qxp cos of the bishop and I doubted he would sac the knight to try and crash through the centre.} 21. Nf2 e4+ {Very tempted to do pxp either way. However the prophetic words I put on the other annotation came back to me, give Baron time, not space!} 22. Ke3 {I can see a rationale for that one, gives the queen the two diagonals whilst stopping the pawn advance...but really that pawn wasn't gonna go anywhere anyway! I think possibly d2 or c2 might have been better.} Bb6 {Just...um...exploring that isolated pawn ;-)} 23. Red1 Qe7 {I thought it worth giving away a half tempo to continue pressure on d4.} 24. b4 Qf6 25. Nb5 {Bad move in my opinion. I think that was Baron getting frustrated and hopeful. Worried me initially but the more I looked at it the more that seemed like a mistake. The only place the knight can go is back unless he wants to sac it.} a6 26. Nc3 {Now here is the crux. Have I got enough to crash through the middle. On paper yes. However despite the disparity in ratings I know Barons a better player than I...so what trick has he got prepared?} Nxd4 27. Rxd4 {q-a2 might have been an option but he chose to do the sac. And I soooo nearly muffed the next move.... luckily it wasn't otb cos my finger was on that bishop ;-)} Qxd4# {But fortunately I hesitated long enough to see the mate! Despite the forced opening I'm very proud of this one. I managed to curb my natural instincts and play to Barons weaknesses. I suspect now however I'm in for a hammering next time ;-)}
