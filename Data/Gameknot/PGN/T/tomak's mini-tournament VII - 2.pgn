1. e4 {Well this is my third attempt at writing up a game. For many years the scandinavian defense was my standard response to 1.e4 but over the past year i have been learning the Sicillian and The Hyper Accelerated Dragon is one of the most logical Sicillians and difficult for white to get a definative edge, at the same time it is true it is hard to win with but given the chance black gets more than equality.} c5 {So here goes the game starts in the standard way.} 2. Nf3 {Natural move.} g6 {Indicating the Hyper accelerated Dragon. Black does not play d6 as if allowed will try to play d5 in one go and not lose the tempo.} 3. d4 {This has to be the best move and has been seen in thousands of games.} cxd4 {Naturally} 4. Nxd4 {There are many sidelines. Qxd4 is possible and playable as is c3.} Nc6 {Black challenges White for control of the central squares} 5. c4 {The Moroxcy Bind. One of the reasons why many Sicillian players stopped playing this line but the bind can be broken and the counterplay is available with the breaks a6 and b5 and in some lines just b5 on its own. I am actually very happy about playing against it because the play is slower and more manoevering rather than bang and crash tactics.} Nf6 {Hitting the e4 pawn hoping for e4-e5 When Qa5+ wins the pawn} 6. Nc3 {Naturally White places his knight on the best square develops and defends has to be best.} d6 {Sadly in this line i have to play d6 now. With the bind in place i have to give up my dreams of playing d5 in one go but now i am going to start counter attacking.} 7. Be2 {Bishop e3 would have been met by Knight g4 so fairly natural to prevent that.} Nxd4 {The Knight on d4 is a vital piece for White and now White starts to go wrong.} 8. Qxd4 {Obviously best} Bg7 {Natural preparing a discovered attack on the queen.} 9. Qd1 {This move was definately wrong. Best was Bishop e3 as the bishop on g7 is not defended yet so did not have to worry yet about me moving my knight. The follow up would have been Queen d2 ready to force the way to h6.} O-O {Natural development} 10. O-O {Natural enough} Be6 {The counter attack begins} 11. Be3 {Developing} Qa5 {This move would not have been possible had i not exchanged on d4 but now is a really important move for Black. Against the bind the rooks want to be on c8 and a8 for maximum counter attacking potential.} 12. Qc2 {Considering that my rook is clearly going to c8 this has to be an error. Again Queen d2 is preferable but should have been done a few moves ago and my pieces are getting into position far quicker.} Rfc8 {Simply attacking c4} 13. Bd4 {Understandable but b3 had to be played here i think but i would have played b5 against it breaking the bind. Knightxb5 QueenxKnight. and cxb QueenxKnight.} Bxc4 {Winning a pawn} 14. Rfe1 {I do not think he has time to play Rook e1. I am not sure what is best but there has to be a more accurate counter to my plans than that and i welcome any feedback on this position.} Bxe2 {Natural and i thought he would play QxB here which is reasonable and gives him defensive chances.} 15. Rxe2 {This move has to be suspect for 3 reasons. 1. Back rank is a little weaker 2. The queen is still pinned. 3. What is that rook doing on e2, how does it improve his game or restrict mine?} b5 {Got to be reasonable} 16. Qd3 {Getting out of the pin but........} b4 {The bind is gone and my pawn is still going to disrupt his setup.} 17. Nd5 {Looks natural counter attacking but......} Nxd5 {Natural } 18. Bxg7 {Hoping for Kingx Bishop and then he can take the Knight with his Queen or the pawn but instead i surprised him with...............} Qxa2 {Splat. Here i thought that Rook e1 was best. Against that i planned: 19.Re1 Qc4 20.Qxc5 Rxc5 21.exN KxB 22. Rxe7 a5 and i figured i stay a pawn up and the a pawn threatens to queen with the rooks behind it and that has to be good for me. } 19. b3 {He thought that b3 trapped the queen but i am sure many of you can see what i played next..........} Qxa1+ {Kapow! It is over 20. BxQ Rc1+ 21. Re1 Rxe1+ 22.Qf1 Rxf1+ 23.Kxf1 Nc3 and i am a rook up with a monster position so he resigned.  Bring it on you Marozy Bind lovers! Cheers}
