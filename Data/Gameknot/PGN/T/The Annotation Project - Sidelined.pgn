1. e4 {Hi everyone!  In this game Dave's king ended up stuck on the a column, it took me a long while to find a way to exploit this situation, but my final move which prompted Dave to wave the white flag sealed his fate.  He was either gonna cop Old Matey or suffer ruinous loss of material.  Anyhow, on with the show and we start the action on Move 9 as the first 9 moves have followed the main line.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6 {9. ...... e6 - this is I think, the best move.  I have scored pretty well with it as black in my personal db.} 10. Nc3 {10. Nc3 - development.  } Na6 11. a3 {11. a3 - to prevent Nb4.} Qf6 12. Ncxe4 {12. Ncxe4 - closing the material deficit to 2 points and keeping the horsies protecting each other.  The Wicked Witch of the West makes that deficit 3 points again by filching my f4 pawn, sigh!} Qxf4 13. Bf3 {13. Bf3 - Fou Leblanc sidesteps the Witch and a possible discovery is lined up on the h1-a8 diagonal.} Kd7 14. d3 {14. d3 - after Dave's king sidesteps Fou Leblanc I then open up a line for Fou Lenoir to attack that Wicked Witch and start Ejection Proceedings.  The Witch backs off to f5.  I now tuck Henry away on the kingside.} Qf5 15. O-O Be7 16. Ng3 {16. Ng3 - I keep harassing that Witch.} Qe5 17. Nf7 {17. Nf7 - a knight fork but this is foiled by the Witch.  However, I do have a trick up my sleeve.} Qd4+ 18. Kh1 Rhf8 {18. ...... Rhf8.  Up until this move we have been following the game between gbsalvio v Easy19 (aka Master Freddy) http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=10369376&mv=29&rnd=0.39166812584981164.  Freddy played Rhb8 and lost.  My opponent attacks the knight so Fou Leblanc takes the b7 pawn forking the a8 rook and the knight on a6.} 19. Bxb7 Rab8 20. Bxa6 Bf6 {20. ....... Bf6 - trying to trap the knight but g5 is available for it.} 21. Ng5 Bxg5 22. Bxg5 {22. Bxg5 - N for B trade.  The Wicked Witch now snatches my b2 pawn.  Looking at the black king I bet you are wondering just how he will come to be trapped on that a column.} Qxb2 23. a4 Qxc2 24. Bb5+ {24. Bb5+ - Fou Leblanc moves away from the side and shuts off the line of that rook on the b column.} Kc7 25. Bf4+ {25. Bf4+ - on his last move, Dave's king walks into a skewer!} Rxf4 26. Rxf4 {26. Rxf4 - I now get rid of one of the rooks at the expense of Fou Lenoir, Eureka!} Qc3 27. Raf1 {27. Raf1 - I feel this is the most aggressive way to go, a doubling on the f column.} g5 28. Rf4f7+ Kb6 29. Rxh7 {29. Rxh7 - the h pawn drops off, and look, the BK is heading towards that a column!} a6 30. Bc4 Ka5 {30. ...... Ka5 - and now that king arrives on a5.  But how can I ensure he cops Old Matey, you can trust jstevens1 to make heavy weather of it though!} 31. Ra7 {21. Ra7 - a pin and pile up on the a6 pawn.} Rb6 {31. ...... Rb6 - defends it.} 32. h3 {32. h3 - I now try to ensure that Henry does not cop Old Matey on the back row.  I do risk getting my knight pinned to the Witch, however.  However, it is only the black rook that can pile up on it.} e5 33. Ne4 {33. Ne4 - I spot that my pawn on d3 could become overloaded so my knight blockades the e5 pawn preventing an exploitation by e4.  Notice that my knight is also attacking the c5 pawn.  If that goes then the a6 pawn could also drop off.} Qd4 34. Nxg5 {34. Nxg5 - Oh, I forgot to mention in my previous note, the g5 pawn was hanging and so I decided to grab it.  At least that pawn will not get down to g4 and try and open up the h file to the detriment of Henry.} Qe3 35. Ne4 {35. Ne4 - dodges the Witch's attack and again blockades that e5 pawn.} Qe2 36. Rg1 {36. Rg1 - bit of a waiting move, what next?} Rc6 {36. ..... Rc6 - guarding that c5 pawn.  It took me nearly 3 days to come up with my 37th move.  I chose it because on analysis I worked out that his best move would be 37. ...... Qc2.  I would then play Rb5+ and he would have to play Kxa4, grabbing my a4 pawn but walking into a bishop fork claiming my rook and Fou Leblanc for the Wicked Witch leaving me a clear piece up in the endgame.  Otherwise, if he leaves the Witch where she is and plays an aggressive move such as Rg6 threatening Qxg2# then I would play Rb5+ and then the BK would walk into a knight fork (Nc3+) which either results in the BK or the Witch meeting a very sticky end.  This is my 37th move ......} 37. Rb1 {37. Rb1 - my opponent no doubt saw what would happen and waved the white flag, giving me now 15 points out of 18 completed games.  Just two more games of this tournament to go.  I know my second place is secure but boy I want to end this one on a high!}
