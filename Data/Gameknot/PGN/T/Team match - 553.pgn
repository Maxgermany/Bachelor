1. e4 {The first couple of moves are standard opening lines, I normally play either E4 or D4, here i play E4 as you can see.} d5 {I always take here.} 2. exd5 e6 {I wasn't expecting this, i took and now i play the game a pawn up.} 3. dxe6 Bxe6 4. Nf3 {Now here is the developing race.} Bd6 5. d4 {I can now take the centre as his centre pawns are gone.} Nf6 6. Be2 {I play here so i can castle.} Nc6 7. O-O Qe7 {I don't really recommend putting your queen in front of your king but he did anyway.} 8. Bb5 {I am a pawn up so i can look to swap off. However, i have always been told that bishops are better than knights so unless it gives you a big advantage keep your bishops.} Bd5 {He made a mistake as i can now pin his queen putting him on the back foot.} 9. Re1 Ne4 {He has to block it.} 10. Nc3 {Now i can attack!!} Be6 11. Bxc6+ {Now i can swap off as i am going to be a knight up anyway...} bxc6 12. Rxe4 {Obviously i take the night.} O-O-O {I think castling kingside was better for him.} 13. Qe2 {Now i look to go Qa6+} Qf6 {I don't know why he did this...} 14. Qa6+ Kd7 15. Bg5 {Now i pin his queen to his rook!} Qg6 16. Bxd8 Bh3 {This move is not really that good...} 17. g3 {I just go here removing the threat of checkmate.} Kxd8 {That was another mistake.} 18. Qxa7 {I just grab another pawn.} Qf6 {Attacks my night but now i can go Qb8+} 19. Qb8+ {If he moves his king i can take the rook as is he takes my night i can go Qe8#.} Bc8 {He has to block it.} 20. Re3 {I defend the knight.} Kd7 {Another pointless move.} 21. Ne5+ {This is nice as i can swap more pieces off.} Bxe5 22. dxe5 Qg6 {He has to move his Queen.} 23. Rd1+ {This is a great attacking move.} Ke7 24. Qxc7+ {Of course i grab the pawn with check.} Ke6 {Now i can win the queen.} 25. Rd6+ {Wins the queen, and forces resignation as I can also force mate eventually, I hope this helps people.  Daryl.}
