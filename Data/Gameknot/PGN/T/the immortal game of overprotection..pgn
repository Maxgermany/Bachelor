1. e4 e6 2. h4 {My very oldest and latest thought in this opening. To the chess addict nurtured on spineless convention, this move comes like a slap in the face--but calm down, dear reader; after all, you cannot be expected to understand such moves. (Forgive me - it is not your fault, until now no one has opened your eyes and ears.) Wait just a little while, and there will pass before you a miracle of overprotection of more than earthly beauty. (I assume that I rightly surmise that you are quite familiar with my great theory of overprotection.) } d5 {Black of course has no suspicion of What is coming and continues serenely in classical style.} 3. e5 {A move of elemental delicacy. (We detest, as a matter of principle, such words as "power" and "strength"; in the first place, such banal expressions make us uncomfortable; and, in the second place, we like even less the brutalizing tendency which such words imply.)  Wherein lies the beauty of 3 e5? Why is this move so strong?  The answer is as simple as it is astonishing. The move is strong because it is weak! Weak, that is, only in the traditional sense! In reality, that is to say, it is not the move but the Pawn on K5 that is weak--a tremendous difference! In former times, it is true, it was customary to reject any move ,which created a weakness. Today, thanks to me, this view is obsolete. For, look, my dear reader, the fact that the Pawn on e5 is weak obliges White to protect the Pawn more and more until at last the state of overprotection arises as it were of itself. But, as we have seen (cf. My System), overprotection is practically equivalent to victory. Hence it follows automatically that the "weak" move, 3 e5, is a certain road to triumph. The rest is more or less a matter of technique. } c5 4. d4 {Here it is quite clear that it is more profitable for White first to provoke c5 and then play d4, rather than the other way round, which is the customary course. For, if White first plays d4, there follows c5 and White's d-pawn is under attack. But my clever transposition of moves changes the situation completely. For now Black's c-pawn is suddenly attacked by White's d-pawn!  } cxd4 {What else can Black do? } 5. h5 {All very clever, original and decisive! Of course the ordinary run of people who envy my every spark of genius but cannot follow my line of reasoning for even three paces, outdo themselves in sneering at me with the poison-dripping epithet, "bizarre."  The text move creates confusion in the whole Black army and prepares for the annihilating invasion by the Queen 18 moves later.  } Qb6 {Naturally not 5...Nc6 6 Bb5! etc. Why should Black play the French Defense only to allow the Ruy Lopez Bishop move after all?! (See Diagram)  } 6. h6 {An avaricious dullard would never hit on this deeply conceived Pawn sacrifice.  } Nxh6 {After 6...gxh6, White has an even more comfortable game.  } 7. Qh5 {The reason for this becomes clear after next move.  } g6 {Black threatens to begin a successful siege of the weakling at e5 with Bg7. But White forestalls this.    } 8. Qh2 {To every fair-minded observer, this move must come as a revelation! All the previous maneuvers now become clear! White has completed his development brilliantly and proceeds to overprotect e5. Against this, Black is helpless.  } Nf5 9. Bd3 {Note the splendid cooperation of White's forces: while the e-pawn and the King Bishop completely blockade Black's position, the development of the overprotective forces takes place behind the broad backs of these sturdy blockaders.  } Nc6 10. Nf3 {As a rule this is a routine move. But here it is strikingly original and as such occupies a place in the treasury of my intellectual property.  } h5 11. b4 {A deep trap, as will soon become apparent!  } Bg7 {How Black must have rejoiced when he anticipated his formidable opponent in the occupation of the long diagonal. But... (See Diagram) } 12. Bf4 {...how bitterly disappointed he must have been to realize that 11 b4 had only been a trap and Bg7 had not been intended at all. The position of Black's Bishop at g7 is now quite pointless. 11...Be7 would have been relatively better.  } Bd7 13. Nbd2 Rc8 {Black no longer has any good moves!  } 14. Ke2 {Again, an extraordinarily deep move. White sees through Black's plans, and in addition he prepares a particularly powerful continuation of his strategy of overprotection.  } Nxb4 {Just what White was waiting for.  } 15. Ne1 {This was the point of his previous move! Black is now forced to exchange off the attacking Bishop at d3. But, with that, even White's King Knight enters the fray with fearful effect at d3, while the square f3 becomes available to the Queen Knight. Surely a grandiose piece of strategy. The fact is that I'm a marvelous player, even if the whole chess world bursts with envy.  } Nxd3 16. Nxd3 {Naturally not 16 cxd3? which would have been quite inconsistent. The Pawn on c2 is unimportant, and Black only wastes precious time by capturing it.  } Rxc2 17. Rae1 {White continues his overprotection without much ado.  } a5 {This counterattack has no punch. Black would naturally like to get a passed Pawn plus a Rook on the seventh, but it is too late for that. } 18. Kd1 {Now the menaced Rook must scurry back, for capture on R7 would be much too dangerous. (See Diagram)  } Rc6 {At last, Black gets the right idea: overprotecting his Pawn at e6. But it is already too late.  } 19. Re2 Ke7 {Introduced into tournament play by myself. See note to White's 14th move. The King overprotects e6.  } 20. Rhe1 Re8 21. Nf3 {Completing the overprotection of e5 and thus deciding the fate of the game. Black has no defense. Note the esthetic effect created by White's position.  } Bf8 {Now Black threatens to complete the overprotection of e6 by playing Ng7. But White has prepared a brilliant combination..  } 22. g4 {Much stronger than the obvious Bg5  etc.  } hxg4 23. Qh7 {Now one clearly realizes the masterly understanding of position which went into White's eighth move (Q-h2!!).  } gxf3 {Had Black continued overprotecting by 23...Ng7 there would have followed 24 Bg5  f6 25 Bxf6  Kf7 26 Ng5 mate. Black's basic error was that he started overprotecting much too late.   } 24. Bg5# {mate.  One of my best games! I am proud of it if only because Herr Systemsson is one of the strongest Scandinavian players. The game made an overwhelming impression on the players and spectators as well as on my opponent. The game has become famous in Denmark as "the immortal game of overprotection."  To the incredulous, the above article was published in the February, 1928,, issue of the Wiener Schachzeitung under the editorship of Hans Kmoch.  Kmoch admired and esteemed Nimzovich as a great player and a profound and original thinker. Yet he could not help poking sly fun at Nimzovich's often pompous and bombastic manner. Luckily this rollicking parody is so good-natured, with a few grains of sense artfully concealed in a farrago of nonsense, that Nimzovich expressed himself as vastly amused by it.--Ed [I.A. Horowitz]}
