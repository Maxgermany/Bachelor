[Opening "Guatemala defence (B00)"]

1. e4 b6 {Owen Defense.  This opening is a bit rare. } 2. d4 {Guatemala Defense.} Bb7 {Black fianchettoes the bishop. } 3. d5 {Bd3, Nc3, Nd2, and f3 seem to be the preferred responses for white.  This d5 tends to give black the advantage, though it seems like a good move.} g6 {Nf6 and e6 are the most typical responses.  g6, not so much.  Does black intend to fianchettoe both bishops?  } 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bf4 h5 6. Nc3 a5 7. Bb5 c5 8. dxc6 e.p. dxc6 9. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {O-O-O+ would be fun, primarily because you do not get to see that very often.  White has to do something about the bishop eventually, however.} 10. Bd3 Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 Nf6 12. Ne5 Rf8 {Black responds to the NxPf7+ threat.} 13. O-O-O Ng4 {While black threatens to fork rooks, Ba6+ (discovered check with the rook) is overlooked.  Since the bishop is hemmed and unprotected, it will fall if white trades knights.} 14. Nxg4 {White responds to black's rook fork threat with an exchange, doubling the black pawns.} hxg4 15. Ba6+ Kc8 {Although the bishop is now protected, white could pick off Pe7 by exchanging bishops and playing Rd7+.} 16. Be2 c5 {Black may have been thinking of a pawn trade, but will have to respond to check.  White picks up a point.} 17. Bxg4+ e6 18. Rhe1 f5 19. Bf3 Nd7 20. e5 Bxf3 21. gxf3 Rh8 22. Rd6 Re8 23. Red1 Ra7 24. a4 Rh8 25. Rxe6 Nf8 26. Rxb6 Rh3 27. Rd3 Kc7 28. Rdd6 Rxf3 29. Rbc6+ Kb7 30. Be3 Rh3 31. Bxc5 Rh7 32. Bxa7 Kxa7 33. Rc8 Rh8 34. Rc7+ Kb8 35. Rg7 Kc8 36. Ra6 Kb8 37. Raa7 Rxh2 38.
