1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 {I have always had good success with this type of pawn structure. The the extra pawn in the centre along with the open b-file and a3-f8 diagonal for the bishop make it attractive for me. } Bg7 {Black is planning to attack the centre via ...c5 with the support of the bishop on g7. It often works well but can on occasion give white a huge centre. Notice how my pawns give me a plus of space and central dominance. This is enough to give me a small but enduring advantage. } 7. Nf3 {Developing a piece and defending d4. } c5 {As expected Harpov plays to attack the centre immediately. The alternative ...0-0 has not scored as well for black in practice. Probably because it gives white time to consolidate in the centre. So if black does want to fight for a win then ...c5 is his only option.  } 8. Rb1 {White has a wide range of choices here but I like Rb1 because rooks belong on open files and hitting at b7 hinders the development of black's LSB and thus his queen side. } O-O 9. Be2 {In my view the only move. It does not hinder the potential of the other pieces and assists in kingside castling.  } Nc6 10. d5 {Attacks the knight and ensures that white has a descent centre. However, it gives up e5 and makes c3 a target. } Ne5 11. Nxe5 {The exchange of knight draws the DSB out of it's protective cave and into a less secure environment. On e5 black will have to watch out for f2-f4 with tempo } Bxe5 {The exchange is good for white as the bishop is vulnerable to f4 and white's centre is almost god like. This guarantees a space advantage.  } 12. c4 {Consolidates the centre but invites black to put pressure on c3 via Qa4+. I plan to give Harpov control of the queen side in exchange for greater development and freedom on the king side. On the other hand black has managed to create significant weakness on the dark squares. His developed bishop is far superior. So white's big centre is balanced by black's big bishop and dark square control. } Qa5+ {Wins the a-pawn but at the cost of lagging development and more lose in space. So to maintain the balance black gets a pawn for the lagging development. } 13. Bd2 Qxa2 {I give up the pawn in order get attacking chances on the king side via f2-f4. If I can play f2-f4 before black moves his DSB I will gain an attack with tempo} 14. O-O {White is now completely developed and ready to attack. My goal is to play f4 with a king side and centre steamroll. But first I must play Be3 in order to prevent black from playing ...Bd4} b6 {Black consolidates his queenside and seems to want to play ...Ba6 hitting at c4. } 15. Be3 {Discouraging ...Bd4 and shoring up any weaknesses created from f4} Bg7 {Black retreats in anticipation for the up coming f2-f4.  } 16. f4 {now white threatens a timely e5 with a massive advantage. } Qa3 {A pointless move that only assists white in further mobilizing his forces. In my view 16...e6  17. e5 f6 was dependable for black. } 17. Rb3 {driving away the queen. } Qa4 {White has improved his pieces and gained an all important tempo. Meanwhile black has moved his queen twice in a row. } 18. Qd3 {After e5 I plan to play d6 with rook and queen behind it to support it. } Qd7 {Harpov's queen has returned home from the hunt but has nothing to show for it. Meanwhile white has a huge centre and great attacking potential to compensate for the pawn. For the pawn white has gained a significant space advantage, central dominance and superior development. This is enough to give white a clear advantage. } 19. e5 {Now black can not play ...f6 or ...e6 very effectively} Qc7 {Black is reduced to passive maneuvering but still white has alot of work to do in order to convert his space advantage.  } 20. Bf3 {Puts the bishop on the dangerous diagonal and threatens d6 winning the rook.  } Bd7 {The alternative ...Bb7 draws more resources away from the king side. This would allow white to kick things off with h4} 21. Bf2 {My idea is to play Bh4 hitting at e7 } Rae8 {Black defends against it. } 22. Be4 {Preventing ...Bf5 and threatens a timely f4-f5 in the future maybe. } a5 {A difficult choice. On a7 the pawn is an easy target for white with the likes of Ra1. On a5 it is no longer possible for white to play on the a-file. Matter of fact white may have to keep an eye out for a timely a5-a4 push from black. However, black creates a lesser weakness on b6 that does comeback to bite him later on.} 23. Rfb1 {threatens to win the b6-pawn. } Reb8 {The pawn is easily defended but now e7 becomes a problem. } 24. Bh4 {Threatening to win a pawn} Bg4 {Another difficult choice for black. The bishop is not safe here and most likely will be kicked. But ...Bc8 with the idea of ...Ba6 is hardly appealing} 25. Kh1 {This waiting move that puts the king on the safety square on the board. While at the same time allows me to put a rook on g1 to support g4. The trade off is that it allows black to defend e7. } Rfe8 {Black has counter attacking chances. Black can also try 25...Bc8 26. h3 Qa7!? forcing Ra3. The idea behind this pawn for black is to pin down some of white's resources to the defense of the queen side. } 26. h3 Bc8 27. g4 Qa7 {Threatening ...a4 which I can not stop. } 28. Bg3 {If 28. f5!? then ...a4 29. Ra3 b5 30. cxb5 c4 31. Qxc4 Bxe5 and white's center has been destroyed. } a4 29. Rb3b2 Rd8 30. Kh2 {I didn't know what else to do so I played a waiting move. I dearly want to push in the centre but every try is countered by black. } Qc7 31. Qc3 {The game has entered into a holding pattern where each player is waiting for the other to break the tension. I choose Qc3 to defend e5 and keep an eye on a possible ...b6-b5 push by black. I was concerned about ...Bd7 followed by ...b5} e6 {only move I think black has to stop f4-f5. For example if 31...Bd7 then 32. f5 Qa7 33. Qd3 b5 34. cxb5 Qb6 35. Qa3 becomes decisive as it looks like white will eventually break through on the queen side. } 32. Qf3 {defending d5, adding support to f4-f5 and threatening d6 all at the same time. } Qa7 {Black is trying to tread water by making maneuvering moves but white's pawn become too much. } 33. d6 {I finally have a passer but it is far from crowning. With the center closed in white's favor the b6 square and black's a4 pawn become the focal point. Harpov has allowed me to setup this spearhead into his position. It is now time to make him pay. Note with the DSB shutout on g7 black is effectively playing a bishop down. } Bb7 {33...Bd7 fails to 34. f5!} 34. Bxb7 Rxb7 35. Qc6 {I have finally broken through and the b6 pawn becomes the decisive factor } a3 36. Ra2 {stops all of black's counter play. He is now sitting duck} Qa6 {attacking c4} 37. Bh4 {Attacking the rook and controlling the critical queening square. } f6 {probably should have just moved the rook!} 38. Qe4 {Defending e5 as I anticipate that Harpov will play g5 opening the f-file for his rooks. } g5 39. Rb3 {Lifting the rook to a more influential spot and attacking a3 and defeading against ...gxh5 indirectly. After Harpov completes his plan to open the f-file he will be unable to hold onto his pawn advantage.  } Rf7 {Harpov is following through with his plan to open the f-file in the hope of creating some counter play. } 40. fxg5 fxg5 41. Bxg5 {The f-file is open but who benefits more?} Rb8 {With the idea of exchanging queens on b7. In the case of defending it is usually a good idea to seek the exchange of queens. It often will lessen the attacking chances. } 42. Rbxa3 Qb7 43. Re2 {Defends e5 } Qxe4 44. Rxe4 Rd7 45. Rb3 {preventing b6-b5} Rf7 46. Kg3 {closing the entry points for the black rook. } Rd7 47. Be7 Rdb7 48. g5 {White's more active king and king side pawn majority now become the deciding factor. } Bf8 {Harpov does what any good defender would do which is to force the exchange of pieces. However, the exchange suits me as it pulls a rook off the b-file} 49. Bxf8 Rxf8 50. Rf4 Rff7 51. Rxf7 {Black resigned on grounds of more loss of material. I hope you enjoyed the game. }
