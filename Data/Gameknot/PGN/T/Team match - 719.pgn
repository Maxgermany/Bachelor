1. e4 {Kings Opening} e5 {I match} 2. Nf3 {Pulling out the knight on the short side} Nc6 {Guarding my pawn} 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Putting pressure on f2} 4. d3 Nf6 {Preparing to castle} 5. Ng5 {Attacking f7} O-O {So I castle so he can't get the fork on the rook} 6. Nc3 Ng4 {Very risky move, I was anticipating the queen taking it, but then I was going to use a pawn to attack a bishop and open up an attack on the queen with my bishop} 7. Qxg4 {He goes for it} d5 {And so do I...} 8. Qh4 {Moves his queen to try for the mate on h7. I could have taken the bishop here, but i didn't.} h6 {Putting even more pressure with my pawns and guarding the mate on h7} 9. Nf3 {Good move by him, moving the knight out of harm's way and to protect his queen} Qxh4 {queen for queen} 10. Nxh4 dxc4 11. dxc4 {I do lose a pawn in the process} Nd4 {Move the knight into the open spot and look for the fork on c2} 12. Kd1 {He sees and counters, but... } Rd8 {I move the rook behind it for a unseen check. I would have liked to have gone to f3 here and take his knight on h4} 13. Bd2 {But he does see that and forces me to reconsider, so I attack his knight} g5 14. Nf5 {Moves his knight to force me to move mine} Nxf5 {I do, and realize it will be taken, but i do see an opportunity forming} 15. exf5 {Obvious} Bxf5 {Left his pawn unprotected, pulling me even again} 16. Nd5 {Kind of scary that I left the middle that open, up the attack would be on c7 for the unprotected pawn.} c6 {So I move the pawn, and at the same time attack his knight.} 17. Ne3 {Unable to move to e7 thanks to my bishop, which, truthfully, was lucky.} Be6 {Moving that bishop out and setting up an attack for his pawn at c4. I was going to go bishop to e3, can't take with his bishop, so takes with his pawn, and I get the pawn at c4 for free.} 18. Ng4 {I don't know. I think he got antsy about losing that pawn and screwed it all up.} Bxg4+ {Take advantage of the mistake} 19. f3 {He counters} e4 {This may look nuts, but it isn't. I know he can take the bishop, and can't take my pawn (puts his king in check). He takes the bishop, I move the pawn up and there is big trouble on d2.} 20. fxg4 {Yup, he goes.} e3 {And now trouble.} 21. Ke2 {He sees the trouble, but I"m gonna take his bishop anyway.} Rxd2+ 22. Ke1 {He's getting trapped. My bishop covers my pawn, my pawn covers my rook.} Rxc2 {Free pawn and opens up the diagonal for the bishop, and keeps me on the 2 line for pawn protection} 23. b3 {He wants to keep that pawn I guess, I could have taken the other one if I wanted, but I'm not interested in pawns at this point.} e2 {With the pawn protected with the rook and him unable to get to my rook, I push the pawn up again. The bishop is now free.} 24. g3 {Hoping to create a little room, it's not working.} Bb4+ {Big trouble. Only move is behind my pawn.} 25. Kf2 {I love this move. Double check, the rook is unreachable, the queen is covered by the bishop. He can't even grab the queen with either rook because of my rook.} e1=Q+ {He has to go to f3, and e2 (queen protected by rook) will be the end.}
