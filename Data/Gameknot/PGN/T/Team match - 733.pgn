1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {not the best move but playable.} Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. O-O {gives black the center by 5.... d5. I think that 5. d4 is better.} d5 6. exd5 exd5 7. Bb5 Be7 {black shouldn't mind changing the bishop for the knight on c6. with a strong center and a pair of bishops in an open game it is clearly that he is on the upper hand.} 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. d3 O-O {bringing the rook to the game. the e file is a great place for it.} 10. b3 {? positional mistake. the pawns on the queen side are getting weaker that way and there are holes on the black squares there.} Re8 11. Re1 Qc7 12. Bb2 Bg4 13. h3 Bh5 14. Na4 {wants: 15. Bxf6 gxf6 (15... Bxf6 - weakness c5) and the position will be about equal.} Nd7 15. d4 Bf6 {it is also possible to play cxd4 and afterwards c5.} 16. Rxe8+ Rxe8 17. g4 {the move black waited to. the king side, of white, is now ruined...} Bg6 18. c3 cxd4 19. Nxd4 {maybe better was cxd4.} c5 20. Nb5 Qc6 {there is a lot of pressue on white's queenside and center.} 21. Qf1 a6 22. Na3 {all white's pices are in the corner.} c4 23. f4 Bd3 24. Qf3 Nc5 25. g5 Nxa4 {demolishing White's queen side.} 26. bxa4 Re2 27. gxf6 Qb6+ {the end!}
