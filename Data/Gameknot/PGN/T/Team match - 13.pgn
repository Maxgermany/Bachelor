Rad1+ Bd7 {The GameKnot world database contains two games that continued 11.… Ke8 12.Bxe7 Nxe7 13.Rd2 Ng6 14.Rfd1 Ke7 15.h3:      15.… Be6 ended in a draw,      15.… Re8 ended in a White victory.} 12. Bxe7+ Nxe7 13. Rfe1 Ke8 {The GameKnot member database records that from this position in 2012 airwarrior-salvadormtz continued 14.Na4 Bg4 15.Nc5 b6 16.Na6 Rc8 17.Rd2 Bxf3 18.gxf3 and White won by checkmate on Move 58.  In this game, however, White feels his fortunes lie along the d-file and with his king-side pawn majority, so he disdains airwarrior’s flash-in-the-pan attack and avoids doubling his f-pawns.} 14. Nd4 Rd8 15. h3 Bc8 16. Rd3 a6 17. Red1 g6 18. Ne4 Nf5 19. g4 {White passes up a draw (by repetition): 19.Nxf5 Rxd3 20.Nf6+ Kf8 21.Rxd3 Bxf5 22.Rd8+ Kg7 23.Ne8+ Kh7 24.Nf6+ Kg7 etc.} Nxd4 20. Nf6+ Ke7 21. Rd3xd4 Rxd4 22. Rxd4 Ke6 23. f4 g5 24. Nh5 Rg8 25. Nf6 Rh8 26. Kg2 {26.Kf2 is more accurate as it keeps White’s king off the light-colored diagonal and gets it to e3 a move sooner.} b6 {After 26.… gxf4 27.Re4 Black has no way to defend his advanced f-pawn directly, but by taking control of the d-file with 27.… Rd8 he could threaten to make White pay for it with his own queen-side pawns.  The text gives White a tempo to relieve his rook of f-pawn guard duty and may therefore deserve a question mark.} 27. Kf3 c5 28. Rd2 Bb7+ 29. Ke3 Bc6 30. c4 Ke7 {The fortunes of both sides depend on them taking the initiative on the side on which they have a pawn majority.  Black has not realized this or he would have played 30.… gxf4+ 31.Kxf4 Rb8; White has but then fails to take advantage of Black’s passivity with 31.h4 (and if …gxh4 32.Rh2).} 31. Nd5+ Bxd5 32. Rxd5 {[?] Correct is 32.cxd5 Rd8 33.Ke4 gxf4 34.Rf2.  Fortunately for White, Black continues to play defense instead of penetrating his position with  32.… h5 33.Rd2 hxg4 34.hxg4 Rh3+.} gxf4+ 33. Kxf4 Ke6 34. Rd2 a5 35. b3 Rf8 36. Rd5 f6 {[?] 36.… a4, that recurring theme of queen-side counterplay, maintains equality.} 37. exf6 Rxf6+ 38. Rf5 c6 {Play by both sides gets a little ragged at this point.  38.… Rg6 39.h4 Rg8 40.Rh5 Rf8+ 41.Ke4 Rf6 presents a tougher nut to crack.} 39. Ke4 {39.Rxf6+ Kxf6 40.a4 is more accurate.} Rxf5 {[??] 38.… Rg6 40.Rf8 h5 gives Black some hope.  Now he has none.} 40. gxf5+ Kf6 41. h4 b5 42. a3 b4 43. a4 Kf7 44. Ke5 h5 45. f6 Kf8 {If White’s f-pawn were the only pawn on the board Black would have the opposition and the game would be a draw by stalemate: 46.Ke6 Ke8 47.f7+ Kf8 48.Kf6.  White realizes such is not the case, however, and avoids letting Black off the hook with that line of play.} 46. Kd6 Kf7 47. Kxc6 Kxf6 48. Kxc5 Ke5 49. Kb6 Kd4 50. c5 Kc3 51. Kxa5 Kxb3 52. c6 Ka3 53. c7 b3 54. c8=Q b2 55. Qc3+ Ka2 56. Qc2 Ka1 57. Kb4 b1=Q+ {Black realizes that after the exchange of the current queens he has no way to stop White from getting another one (or two).  A resignation when it is one’s opponent’s turn to move is not all that uncommon in games played over the internet with time control expressed in increments of days.}
