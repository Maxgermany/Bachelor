1. d4 {..I like the Benko...I do...it can wrong for white if they get the move order wrong...and this is an example...its not a brilliant game but I guess if your interested in taking up an attacking opening against d4/c4..its nifty....} Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 4. b3 {..white is initially looking to decline the "gift" of the pawn...the theme of the Benko is very  quick development for the pawn with a solid position in the end game for the king...} g6 5. cxb5 a6 {...in some move orders the pawn is not taken straight away...black just develops..} 6. Nc3 Bg7 {...adding pressure and forcing white to defend. Note that white has no kingside development at the moment...} 7. Bb2 d6 8. e3 Qa5 {..black simply adds the pressure, normal move for white here would be Qc2...} 9. bxa6 Bxa6 {..black wants to get rid of the white square bishop and disrupt the kings journey the the kingside..} 10. Be2 {...white needed to play Bxa6...and now black has the huge pressure on the Nc3...in effect winning a piece with simple moves...} Ne4 11. Bxa6 {..although white has taken the piece, black has the intermediate move to win material back straight away...} Bxc3+ {..as both dark square bishops will come off the board the black king is safe...} 12. Bxc3 Qxc3+ 13. Kf1 {..white has no choice.....and now black gets material back...} Nxa6 14. Ne2 {..well black just needs to keep the head and continue the threats, forcing the moves by continue threats..need to get the extra pieces into play...} Qf6 15. f4 Nb4 16. a4 {..while white is behind and in trouble...maybe Qb1 is a last hope...so black has the lovely trap that white cant accept or its curtains and brings the 2nd knight to zoom into the king.....} Nxd5 {..if Qxd5, black mates in 2, Qxa1 & Qxc1...} 17. a5 {..white must have played this quickly as the terminal fork now follows....} Nxe3+ {...some players annoyingly play on but (to their credit) my opponent sees the fat lady gargling....and about to bring it home...Kg1 Nxd1, Rxd1 Rx5, black has the terminal threat of Ra1 with Qxa1....}
