O-O-O O-O 13. f4 Rab8 14. fxe5 {Normally I would play 14.f5, but in this case I chose to exchange as I was material up.} dxe5 15. Nf3 c5 {?} 16. c3 {Oops. Now why didn't I take that pawn?} c4 {?

Nc6 Nd6 28. Nb4 {? This drops a pawn.} a5 {!} 29. Nc6 Nxc4 30. Kb3 {I didn't see anything better in playing 30.Kd3 or 30.b3, so I just picked this.} Kd7 {? Black can win a pawn with 30...Nd2+ 31.Kc2 Nc4! when white must draw by repetition or allow 32.b3 Ne3+ or 33.Kd3 Nxb2+. } 31. Kxc4 Kxc6 32. b4 {Now after 32...axb4? 33.cxb4 white's pawns will dominate. 32...Kb6 33.bxa5+ Kxa5 34.Kd5! and the white king will eat up the kingside pawns. 32...a4 33.b5+ Kb6 34.Kb4 is also a win.}
