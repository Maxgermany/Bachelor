1. g3 e5 2. Bg2 d5 {Very aggressive!} 3. e3 Nc6 4. c3 Bf5 {Wow!  Aggressive!  I love it} 5. Ne2 Bxb1 {hahahaha.....maybe too aggressive.  I don't like trading bishop for knight in early game.} 6. Rxb1 Nf6 7. d4 exd4 8. Nxd4 Bd6 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Qe2 {Lots of trading going on} Qd7 11. h3 Ne4 12. Bxe4 dxe4 {joeyjp has a really bad pawn structure here.  He had doubled pawns and then a gap on both sides of the pawns....not good.  For the most part, pawns are at their strongest when there is a chain of them with protection support from other pawns on either side of them.} 13. Qg4 {poolplayer makes a poor play here.  He has the position advantage...yet he offers to trade queens at the cost of him developing stacked pawns????} Qxg4 14. hxg4 O-O {White's previous move of trading queens I think really hurt him.  Now he lost his position advantage and there are so few pieces on the board that white doesn't have a good opportunity to really hurt joeyjp for his poor pawn position on the right side of the board and away from his king.} 15. b4 a5 16. a3 c5 17. b5 Be5 18. Bb2 {Another bad move by white.  He should have moved bishop to d2. Now as we'll see....joeyjp has the opportunity to use this bishop move as a way of pinning the rook on b1.  In essence, you'll see how joeyjp uses white's own pieces against him....pretty cool!} Rab8 {And there we go....joeyjp has used white's poor previous bishop move against him.  White had a good pawn on b5....but now white's own bishop is blocking the rook's provided protection for that pawn.  Good job joeyjp!} 19. O-O Rxb5 {There we go...that pawn is gone and you can see that white's position is terrible.  He has trapped his own bishop and used his own bishop to block his previously powerful rook on b1.  On a side note, this is how I usually play against my brothers.  I will let him put his own pieces in poor positions and then he ends up blocking his own pieces from having any kind of attacking or defending power.  This is a great skill to learn and chess and can be used at various levels.  However, I have found it more difficult to do this type of thing to very good players of course.} 20. Rfd1 g6 21. Rd5 {I don't know about this move.  I would have rather moved my bishop to a1 and offered a trading of rooks.  But of course I recognize the terrible position that white is in and I don't think that poolplayer does.} Bxc3 {There we go!  Great move!  This game is over.  The piece advantage is going to be too large now.  You can see what I was talking about.  If you go back the last 10 moves or so.  You'll see that white's bishop and rook on b1 are doing absolutely nothing.  They are just sitting there while joeyjp is developing his pieces and creating a better board position for himself} 22. Kg2 Bxb2 23. Rd7 {White should have moved his rook to d2.  He could have possibly done the same thing that joeyjp did to him and use his bishop to block his own knight and remove the rook on b5's attacking power.  So this move here was a poor move I think} Rb7 24. f3 exf3+ 25. Kxf3 c4 26. Rxb2 Rxb2 27. Rxc7 Rc2 28. Rc5 a4 29. Ke4 f5+ 30. gxf5 gxf5+ 31. Ke5 {Here is another good lesson for players.  If you are at a large piece advantage in the late game.  You should trade is possible!!!!  I know when I first started playing...I would want to keep my pieces and try and increase my piece advantage.  But then I might actually make a mistake and allow my opponent back into the game.  So, remember that if your opponent has no pieces on the board and they are behind in piece advantage, they will lose 99% of the time.  So I think that joeyjp does a great job here.  He offers to trade pieces and white takes it.} f4 32. gxf4 {bad move.  This opens up black's h pawn to a free lane} h5 33. Ke6 h4 34. Rh5 Rc3 35. Rxh4 Rxe3+ 36. Kd5 Rc8 37. f5 c3 38. Kd4 Rce8 {At this point the game is basically over.  White played an extremely poor mid and late game.  He allowed joeyjp to pin his bishop against his rook.  This caused both his bishop to be blocked by his own pawns and his rook to be blocked by his bishop.  Joeyjp then had the opportunity to develop his pieces and take advantage of white's mistake.  Good job joeyjp!  Good win!  Hope everybody enjoyed this!} 39. Kc5 c2 40. Rh1 Re8e5+ 41. Kd6 Rxf5 42. Rc1 Rc3 43. Ke6 Rf2 44. Kd5 Rd2+ {}
