1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The sicilian najdorf } 6. f3 {The start of the english attack.  I am preparing Be3 and g5 h5 pawns avalanche on the kingside} e5 {kicking the knight } 7. Nb3 Be6 {standard stuff in this line} 8. Be3 Be7 9. Qd2 {preparing to castle on queen side} Nc6 10. O-O-O O-O 11. g4 {there we go king side attack} b5 {The race is on Black on the queenside attack while me on the kingside  attack.} 12. g5 {threatening to take the knight on f6} Nh5 {I think b4 was better. But the text move should be ok} 13. Kb1 {an important precaution move . It got to do with future Nf4 tactics} Rc8 14. Nd5 {The threat is 15.Nxe7 and exposing the backward d6 pawn} Bxd5 {this frees my light squared bishop and also driving the knight away. the knight does not have good square to go. I feel I am beginning to take slight edge.} 15. exd5 Nb8 16. Bh3 {My bishop joins the game with the knight on h5 a target} Nd7 17. Bg4 Nf4 {Here I faced dilemma. If I take the knight then I will drop g5 pawn too.I did not want that} 18. h4 Rc4 {This is an error but I dont know what else to suggest if I were black. because I can drive the rook away and I can go on to take the knight and win a pawn } 19. Na5 Rc7 {This loses the game. The computer suggests Nb6 sacrificing the exchange to thwart my attack.} 20. Bxf4 exf4 21. Nc6 Qe8 {only move to save the bishop} 22. Rhe1 {threatening to take the bishop} Ne5 {This speed up Black's demise.  22...Nb8 was much better defense.} 23. Nxe5 dxe5 {Here I faced 2 choices. the immediate d6 or delaying d6 in favour of Rxe6. The second option is possible because of my super bishop} 24. Rxe5 {in the end I go ahead with this but with doubt in mind if I was right or not} f6 {A surprise. But it will not change the situation. d6 is still possible} 25. gxf6 {damaging king side pawn before retreat on e file} gxf6 26. Ree1 Qg6 {I guess it was better for the queen not to leave  the 8th rank} 27. d6 {finally and Rd8 does not save} Bxd6 28. Qxd6 {Qxc2 does not lead to mate} Qxc2+ 29. Ka1 {a piece up wonderful position and open g-file} Qc5 30. Be6+ {vacating the g file} Kh8 31. Qxf4 {Black Resigns. Finally I win by using the opening that I never used before but lost to it many times.  }
