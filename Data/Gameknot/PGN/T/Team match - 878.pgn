1. e4 {rooks and knight vs. queen: wins} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {The fast attempt threatening a poor check on f7. I tried this once. But that was not funny. } h6 {That basicly covers g6, the spot for the white knight. Although not yet necessary at this point - g6 is still covered by the queen} 4. d3 {Now h6 is necessary if I'm counting right.} a6 {Avoiding white to pin the queenside knight against the king with his bishop on c4. This ended up in a bad trade too often. Also this is preparing b5, attacking the bishop on c4. } 5. a4 {White avoids b5. Now this would end up in my rook to be captured.  } Bc5 {Now I am threatening a poor check, trying to catch up a bit with my castle :) } 6. Be3 {Well, at least I am trying. But I am still behind as white has figured correctly.  Actually, that seems to be an interesting trade. I think I will try this one day. } d6 {but not today. I am not ignoring the bishop on c4, by the way. } 7. Bxc5 {Thats an interesting trade, Mr. White. } dxc5 {Nice view for the black queen :)} 8. Nc3 {Thats ok, now d5 is clearly in whites hands. As is b5 buy the way. But there is no attack yet. } Nf6 {Ketchup. } 9. b3 {looks a bit like the white bishop is pushed into an attack :). Probably white expects 9. ... be6 and does not really want let the queens face each other if I decided to play tit for tat. } Bg4 {But I am going to be mean today. I will take the knight!! Also I am happy that I have catched up with the castling options. } 10. h3 {This will not scare me away, sorry. Otherwise I would have gone to e6 before. Usually. } Bxf3 {This time I will take the knight because it is covering d4. Sorry, was covering...  the view for my queen improved dramatically} 11. Qxf3 {what I had expected. White now has two castling positions. Thats why a bishop/knight trade on the kingside does not hurt too much. Usually. } Qd4 {This really is a beautiful position for the black queen. She is scaring whites remaining knight to death. All ways to safe it, are bad or dangerous.  All 4 of them are killing two rooks.  12. Nb5 or Ne5 would allow a fork on c7, but what is one lost black rook against two white rooks?} 12. Kd2 {There is a fifth option that I did not really expect. This is weakening the white king. I had expected a kingside castle, abandoning the knight and rescuing the rooks. Thats a noble king, I am impressed. } O-O {Well, this is basicly defining which side I will attack later.... also i dont want to leave my king in the E file. } 13. Nd5 {I don't see an attack.  The black king has left the stage. The white rooks are covering each other now and the white knight can feel pretty comfortable on d5.} Nxe4+ {This is dangerous. But I dont think that white will take knight, he would have to use the queen. In return I could consider a queen exchange, because I am in a good position, I also could decide 14. Qe4 Qf2 annoying the white king... } 14. Ke2 {... I am lucky. } Nc3+ {I can proceed.} 15. Nxc3 Qxc3 16. Qd5 {This is avoiding the fork 17. ?? Nd4 and also opening the white kings long way home. Moving the king back to baseline, would still sacrifice two rooks. I feel comfortable.} Qxc2+ {Check.  16. Qd5 Nd4  also looks tempting, but I was looking not to deactivate the black queen on c3.  That was stupid, because of 16. ... Nd4  17. Ke3 (forced!) Nc4  (fork on Ke3 and Ra1) would definitly win a Rook without risking the knight!!! } 17. Kf3 {Step two of the long way back} Nd4+ 18. Kg3 {Step 3} c6 {Scaring the queen away. I am not sure whether I really planned this already but its also preparing to win the white bishop...} 19. Qxe5 {Preparing to win my knight by removing the covering pawn #1} b5 {Now the attack on the bishop} 20. axb5 cxb5 21. Qxc5 {removing the cover #2 of my knight as expected} Ne2+ {solved by a little bit of check} 22. Kh2 bxc4 {and  the bishop is won } 23. bxc4 {again, not looking for queen exchange} Qxd3 {not the best move...} 24. Rhd1 Qg6 {ok,  I do leave...} 25. Ra2 Nc3 {Isn't this a beatyful fork? Nf6 would have been a nice idea too, treatening mate on g2.  but white could easily defend it.  } 26. Rd6 {White seems to be angry. I cant blame him...} Rac8 {want to exchange queens now? This would loose matarial for white in any variant, because the black knight is still aiming at a white rook.  Thats why I did not decide 26. .. e4 for another fork. I am holding this back for 27. Rxa6} 27. Qe5 Nxa2 {Now I really want to figure out, whether two rooks and a knight are stronger than a queen. } 28. Rxg6 fxg6 29. f3 Rfe8 {baring my teeth} 30. Qd5+ {forced, more or less. I did not want to wait for white to consider this option.} Kh7 {not a castle, but a hut :)} 31. c5 {from now on its hard work for both of us. white will try to advance his paws and attack my tiny castle - sorry, my hut. g6 is the weak point } Nc3 {he felt lost down there} 32. Qc4 Nb5 {now he feels quite comfortable} 33. c6 Rc7 {first of three moves to win this pawn} 34. f4 {going for my hut} Rec8 {#2 going for the pawn} 35. g4 {cover for the advancing f-pawn} Rc7xc6 {#3 taking the pawn and attacking the queen} 36. Qd5 {covering f5. } Rc6c2+ {extra time, ignoring the danger on f5} 37. Kg3 Rf8 {altough this is not equaling forces on f5, at least this avoids 38. f5 gxf5, 39. Qf5  } 38. h4 {???? I think 38. f5 still would have been the better choice. this move gives me a great chance.} Rc3+ {removing the noble king.  } 39. Kh2 {obviously, Qf3 was not an option. } Rxf4 {this removes the worst danger for my hut. now i feel pretty safe} 40. Qe5 {attacking the rook} Rf2+ 41. Kg1 Rd2 {threatening checkmate} 42. Qe1 {avoiding checkmate and attacking the rook} Rd4 {taking cover} 43. Qa1 {attacking the covering pawn for my knight} Rc2 {again threatening checkmate, in case white takes the pawn} 44. Kf1 {getting the king involved} Nc3 {no need to work any more. lets simplify.} 45. Ke1 Rd1+ 46. Qxd1 {forced} Nxd1 47. Kxd1 Rc4 48. g5 a5 {this is it, I have no trouble emancipating a queen. white risignes, the rooks win. }
