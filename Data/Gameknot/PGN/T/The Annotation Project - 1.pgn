1. e4 {My final game in the Annotation Project and my last chance to crow :-)  Although I outgraded scalawag, I could hardly take winning for granted as I have blown several games against lower rated opposition recently, especially in this tournament (take a bow thebishop1000 and graderguy).  Anyway, at the time of writing, this win takes me to 4th place, leapfrogging yoshark, with whom I shared the points earlier, and ahead of fellow inveterate commentators, nuntar and dmaestro, over both of whom I was fortunate enough to do the double.  Congratulations to Freddy and Joanne for heading the pack and Steve for pushing into 3rd place.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 {Towards the end of the tournament, this had become my favourite continuation for Black.} 9. Bxg4 e6 10. Nf7 {White takes the bait of the fork.  Black hopes that White will waste too much time in taking the Rook after the Queen moves.} Qe8 11. Nxh8 Bd6 {Quickly developing the Bishop while attacking the Nh8 and pawn on f4, giving a materialistic White much to ponder.} 12. f5 {The N couldn't yet be saved, but the pawn threatens to complicate things.  I'm happy to swap it off.  The Knight can wait.} exf5 13. Bxf5 Nd7 {Now the Queen can move and the Rook will threaten the Knight in her place.} 14. Rf1 {?  White could have won a pawn and threatened to release his Knight with 14. Bxh7.  Furthermore it would have been better to castle than just play 14. Rf1, getting the King out of the centre and still getting the Rook to f1.} Nf6 {Now the N defends both h7 and e4, freeing the Queen and Rook for action.} 15. Nc3 Qe7 16. Ng6 hxg6 17. Bxg6 {White at least gets another Black pawn for his N but his QB and QR are still completely undeveloped.  Nominally, the material score is level but White has already lost any tactical advantage gained from the Queen sacrifice.} Bxh2 {I don't normally go in for pawn-grabbing but this seems risk-free, eliminates White's kingside majority and gives me g3 from which to harass White's King.} 18. Ne2 {Not only does this defend g3 but it reduces the risk of discovered check on the e-file.  However, it still does nothing for the QB and QR.} Bc7 {Now my Bishop prepares to pin White's d-pawn, thus further delaying freeing moves for White.} 19. d3 {White gets in his pawn move while he can.} exd3 {I preferred this to advancing the pawn as it looks like weakening White's pawn structure.  However, I'd overlooked White's reply.  I could probably have gained a greater advantage by advancing the pawn to e3.  Black was well placed to support it there.} 20. Bxd3 Re8 21. Bg5 {The QB is out and pins Black's Knight!} Be5 {Over-defending the Knight and attacking b2} 22. O-O-O {Good castling!  White is now fully developed and is still +1 up...  but Black has a trick up his sleeve.} Bxb2+ 23. Kxb2 Qe5+ {Black recovers the pawn thanks to the hanging Bg5.} 24. Kb3 b5 {but now I either forgot about recapturing the B or spotted another possibility.  I forget which!} 25. Bf4 c4+ {Oh yes... the fork :-)} 26. Bxc4 bxc4+ 27. Kxc4 {and now the Ne2 is unprotected, so he falls instead of the B.} Qxe2+ 28. Kb3 {Now it's a relatively straightforward king hunt.} Qb5+ 29. Ka3 Nd5 30. Bd2 Rb8 31. Rdb1 Qa6+ {and, faced with mate in 1, White resigned.}
