[Black "Not happy opponent (1677)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B75), dragon, Yugoslav attack"]

1. e4 {kings pawn opening} c5 {Sicilian defence. Mine favourite opening against e4. } 2. Nf3 {White wants to play open Sicilian. He could have played Nc3 or f4 which would both lead to a more positional game.} d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {Dragon defence. } 6. Be3 {Most played move in every level.} Bg7 7. f3 Bd7 {Here I mixed the opening order in order to make my opponent think for a while for nothing.} 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O O-O {Both players castled and the mating race is on. White usually starts his attack earlier. But black will catch white if he sacrifices his rook in the right time.} 10. h4 h5 {Black usually plays h5 to slow down whites attack. Because time is really crucial in this opening.} 11. Bh6 {A thematic move in dragon defence.} Bxh6 12. Qxh6 Nxd4 13. Rxd4 Rc8 {Now blacks rook is eyeing on the knight on c3.} 14. Be2 {Getting ready to play g4. If black doesn't do something he will be crushed.} Qa5 {I am starting my own attack. Now the exchange sacrifice on c3 can be dangerous.} 15. g4 {? A mistake. White should have played Rd3 to protect the c3 knight and then g4. } Rxc3 {! The right time to sacrifice the rook. Now the pawn structure around the white king is terrible. } 16. bxc3 {The only move.} Qxc3 17. Rdd1 {Whites only move that doesn't lose} Rc8 {Putting more pressure on the c file.} 18. Bd3 Bb5 {! 5 moves ago all white pieces were part of an attack. Now all of them have to go back to help their king.} 19. Qe3 {Most logical move. Protecting the bishop.} hxg4 {Black can't continue his attack. Because he is out of ammo. } 20. Kb1 {! A good move. Now black is forced to excange pieces. A move like 20.fxg4? would have been a mistake 20. ... Nxg4 21.Qf3 Bxd3 22. Qxd3 Qxd3 23. cxd3 Nf2 and black regains his rook with 2 extra pawns.} Bxd3 21. Qxd3 Qxd3 22. cxd3 gxf3 23. Rh3 {? A mistake. Rf1 would have been better.} d5 {A good move if 24. Rxf3 dxe4 25. dxe4 Nxe4 and black is still in a good position. Or 24. exd5 Nxd5 25. Rxf3 Nc3  and black takes back his rook.} 24. e5 {White plays the best move.} Ng4 {Blacks knight comes to protect the pawn with tempo.} 25. d4 Ne3 {Now we see why the 23. Rh3 was a mistake.} 26. Rc1 {? White had to play Rd-h1.} Rxc1+ 27. Kxc1 f2 {! Now white is completely lost.} 28. Rf3 f1=Q+ 29. Rxf1 Nxf1 {And white resigns.
