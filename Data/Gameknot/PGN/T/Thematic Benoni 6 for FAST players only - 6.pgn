1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Nf3 Bg7 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Nd2 Nbd7 {First ten moves for both sides are "by the book". normal benoni moves. White is a pinch better, but insignificantly. Hey, he is a half tempo up to start :)} 11. f3 {freeing up the knights and lockin' down the pawns..} a6 {preventing Nb5 or Bb5, probably better is 11)...Nh5, heading for f4. } 12. Nc4 {hitting the week backwards d6 pawn and eyeing b6 for later} Qc7 {12) ..Nb6 is much better, perhaps even putting black in a better spot. it defends the pawn, develops a piece, and attacks a more active white piece. } 13. Bf4 {hitting the weak pawn again.. and forcing Bf8...} Bf8 14. a4 {im headin to a5! } Nh5 {black probably should have played Nh5 before my bishop got to f4.. but.. } 15. Be3 Nb6 {trying to deny a white knight control of b6, but alas, white has two knights. 15)..Bg7 is better. } 16. Nxb6 Qxb6 17. Qd2 Bg7 {this is the correct move. 17)..a5? restricts the white knight from getting to b6, but allows the bishop to be outposted at b5} 18. a5 Qd8 19. Na4 {after a long journey, white's knight heads to b6. } Bd7 {I think 19)..f5 is better, attacking the white center. } 20. Nb6 Rb8 21. Nxd7 {What? All that wasted time to get to b6 and now white takes? Why..? Simple enough: white wants to dominate the white squares, and black's white bishop is about all that's preventing him from doing so. Besides, b6 isn't that hot, it eyes a buncha useless squares: (a8, c8, c4, d5, d7)} Qxd7 22. Bd1 {threatening Ba4. and heading to a4 either way. } Qe7 23. Ba4 Rec8 {Probably better is Rf8, maybe preparing f5. } 24. Rac1 {a fine move indeed! white sees the b5 push coming and prepares a threat in response to it that will be used! } b5 25. axb6 e.p. Rxb6 26. b3 {I was considering b4 here, but that would leave black a pawn up after my little trick. } Rb4 {funny how black moves into it though...} 27. Qxb4 cxb4 28. Rxc8+ {winning two rooks for a queen and a hell of a position with the bishop pair. } Bf8 29. Re8 {black is being squeezed. } Qh4 30. e5 {black shouldn't take, as it causes problems, but .. } dxe5 {walking into Bc5, winning a piece..} 31. Bc5 Nf6 {preventing Bxf8.} 32. Rxf8+ Kg7 33. d6 {a grand move. Kxf8, and d7  leads to promotion. } Nd7 {34) Bxd7? ...Kxf8} 34. Bf2 Qf6 35. Ra8 {black shouldn't fall for another pin =x d6 is eerily safe.. } Qxd6 36. Rd8 {oops.. a queen isn't nearly enough to handle two rooks and a bishop pair, black resigns. }
