1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. c3 Bc5 4. Qf3 Nf6 5. Ne2 {This opening quickly activates the queen but I think it also endangers it as well. } d6 6. h3 Be6 7. Bxe6 fxe6 8. d3 O-O 9. O-O d5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Bg5 {First attempt to prevent Ne4 pin} Qd6 12. Nd2 {Second attempt also activates the Q-side black knight. Good} Rae8 {Idea was 13. ...e4 14.dxe4 Nxe4 pinning the white queen and making white be half a move or so behind.} 13. b4 Bb6 14. a4 e4 15. dxe4 Qd7 {Queen was still making Nxe4 a bad move.} 16. a5 {gs was not paying attention to my moves.} Nxe4 {Finally} 17. Qh5 Bxf2+ 18. Kh1 Re5 19. Nxe4 dxe4 20. Rad1 Qf5 21. Nf4 {Forcing me to defend the bishop. Good.} Bg3 {Attacking my queen by moving the knight results in double take at f1 = mate.} 22. Qg4 Qxg4 23. hxg4 Rxg5 24. Ne6 {This move got me very nervous. I was losing both rooks no matter what or even losing to Rxf8 mate.} Rxf1+ 25. Rxf1 h6 26. Nxg5 hxg5 {A passed pawn, locked king and 1 rook against bishop and knight. He was done for.} 27. Kg1 e3 {There was nothing to stop the pawn from being queened.} 28. Rf3 e2 29. Rxg3 e1=Q+ 30. Kh2 Ne5 31. b5 Qe2 32. Kh3 Qd1 33. Kh2 Nxg4+ 34. Kh3 Nf2+ 35. Kh2 Qh1# {Pretty simple in the end.}
