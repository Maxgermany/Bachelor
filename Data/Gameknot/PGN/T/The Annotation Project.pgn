Nxa8 {Black has actually fallen behind in material but hopes to harrass the W king and then capture the N.} Qxf4 13. h3 Qg3+ 14. Kf1 Na6 15. d3 {White needs to develop.} exd3 16. cxd3 Qxd3+ 17. Be2 Qf5+ 18. Kg1 {Here, although material is even, I thought Black should have an edge since the N is trapped.} Nb4 {Simply 18 ...e5 would have made the Q retreat and N capture effective. But I hoped to gain by harrassing the W rook.} 19. Nc3 {I expected Na3. } Qc8 {? Better was 19 ...Nc7 20 Rb1 Na3, winning the rook.} 20. Bf4 Qxa8 21. Bg4 {Suddenly, I begin to realize Black is in real trouble. } e6 22. Bxe6 Be7 23. Nb5 {White's attack is very strong.} b6 {? ... Na6 is necessary} 24. Rd1+ { A nice move and an example of how quickly the game can shift in this opening. Black resigns, since when the K moves, the Q is lost to a fork.}
