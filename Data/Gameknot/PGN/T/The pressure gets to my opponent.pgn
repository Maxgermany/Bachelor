[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {...there are more mistakes, and psychology IS a bigger thing than I thought. I was asked by one of my opponents why I waited so long to join the USCF etc etc.... oh that's right, my age is on a need to know basis. Although I'll bet not too many of you would beat me in a crit or a cycling road race. ;) Anyways, my response is I've always enjoyed chess more as a fun hobby; to reach my full potential, I would have to give up far too many other interests I currently enjoy... back to the game. Nf3, an interesting opening that can transpose into many different setups...} c6 {Well, I'm going to see his intentions immediately, by playing - if you've seen ANY of my games, you'll know I like the Caro-Kann. I'll have something now to look into... 1. ...c6 is probably not best here! Oh well.} 2. c4 {And his response is not the best response either. Although we can transpose into book, I don't think this is mainstream so far.} d5 {Maybe the Reti? Anyone? I'm not up at all on the Reti or English variations. I really don't know what white is doing here. This could transpose into one of the Caro-Kann variations I haven't seen much of. We'll see.} 3. b3 {White has played a passive move, albeit it will allow the dark-squared bishop to exert pressure from the flank. Reti? Nimzowitsch? This is what happens when you get a white player who wants to play a certain way with a black player who wants to play a certain way. An odd opening that ends up being not quite what either of us is shooting for. One problem for white that occurs later, is that flank openings should be played with the idea of pressuring the center. White fails to do this properly, and you'll see the result soon.} Bf5 {Playing as if it's a regular Caro-Kann. At this point, why not.} 4. Nc3 e6 {I decided not to take that pawn. Here I thought about moving d4, forcing the knight to retreat or move to the side of the board. But I felt little was to be gained; one consideration for certain flank openings is to try to get your opponent's center overextended, and I didn't want to take that on quite so early until I had time to think on it more.} 5. d3 {Fritz dislikes this move. I'm not fond of it either. Again I was tempted to advance that pawn right now. But no, there's too much developing needing...} Nd7 6. h3 {Well I'm developing. At this point of the opening I was a little dumbfounded by this move. See, here's why: is white considering a kingside pawn storm? If so, then why is his queenside pawns wide open? Where will his king find safety? When one's opponent is good but a little bad, or bad but a little good, well then, all one can do is play the board. I decide just for fun to see what happens if...} h5 {I have just tempted him to think about playing now on the kingside. Maybe he'll play with those pawns over there and leave his king vulnerable. Such a move against a really strong player would be a little dangerous for black. At this point, none of Fritz's evaluations indicate any danger towards black, even if this looks awful positionally.} 7. Bg5 Be7 8. Bf4 {Here my opponent wastes a tempo. Why move the bishop to threaten the queen unless you expected to trade bishop for bishop, as there is no real other move for black? Well, okay; you might say f6 or Ne7. But I wanted to meet aggression with aggression, and wanted my bishop on that diagonal if I could; f6 would have made that plan too slow.} Bf6 {So I get my bishop to that diagonal, even though very soon I'll make that bishop worth a lot less because of another plan I decide to implement that I liked. The bishop needed to be there anyways for that plan, another reason to not move the knight there, which would not help. Without that plan, Nf6 is really only slightly better. At this point, I see no rhyme or reason to my opponent's moves here, unless he were to immediately crash down on the center hard...} 9. Qc2 {But he's not ready to, and will miss that opportunity, something he should have been doing by now.} d4 {With more supporting pieces out and my pawn structure approximating what I want, I do not fear advancing that d pawn now. It's a good way of getting a space advantage if my opponent chooses not to open the board. At this point, he's been neglecting to really pressure the center, and this results in white ending up being passive for a good while.} 10. Ne4 Bxe4 {After a brief think, I decide I don't want that white squared bishop. I am thinking since my opponent has been playing passively, that I can lock up the center, and then my knights will be more useful to me if I can keep things locked up. And that is what happens. This is why over the board chess, when one has time to understand what one's opponent's playing style is, has the psychological aspect that online blitz chess lacks.} 11. dxe4 e5 {And thus my dark-squared bishop has become 'bad'... but later, it will be of use.} 12. Bh2 {After the game, white decided Bh2 was a critical mistake. Better was Bd2. Fritz agrees somewhat. That particular bishop ends up missing out on most of the action, in effect, white plays much of the game a piece down. Nearly two pieces down, because his other bishop is a really bad bishop! At least my 'bad' bishop is not as bad as his, as you'll see later. Here it's possible because of ...h5, white thinks I'll castle queenside and thus is trying to keep the bishop on that diagonal. But he's also mishandled the whole flank thingy. You're supposed to pressure the center from a distance, and I get to advance my pawns with tempo due to the way he played.} c5 {And now I'll try to keep this board as locked up as I can.} 13. Qd3 Ne7 14. e3 {The game is still equal, according to Fritz. But here, I soon make a couple of minor miscues.} Nc6 15. exd4 {First, however, my opponent thinks to get rid of the doubled pawn. Is that a good choice? Fritz thinks it was better to keep the tension.} Qa5+ {And I make an inaccuracy by lazy thinking in this game at this point. My thinking here is I want the knight on f3 to move, and I hope to provoke this. But I failed to realize that white can force a queen trade here, and since I've equalized and gotten the initiative pretty much by white's passive play, I definitely ought to keep queens on the board at this point.} 16. Qd2 {And after this, I realize I must trade queens. Ergo, the queens come off.} Qxd2+ 17. Nxd2 {Taking with the king is a possibility, if white decides not to castle at all. I haven't castled yet either. I see no imminent threat in this position to warrant it.} Nxd4 {Taking with the c pawn would have given me a passed pawn. But... it will be harder for my opponent to get to d5, so for a good while this open file will then be mine to control as I feel like, at least with the current position and for some time. Plus, I am trying to tie white up having to defend; so white decides to try a different idea shortly.} 18. Bd3 {Stopping Nc2 and at least getting that glorified pawn out. Oh, which is also the sad state for my bishop on f6. For the time being.} g5 {Fritz doesn't like this, but I'm considering a plan. I can still castle safely on the queenside if I choose, or simply step into e7; but if I turn the tables on white and storm his kingside, castling kingside for white would not be as comfortable. So that is what I'm considering here. A problem for black is my rooks are not yet positioned right, and my knights will need to do a good amount of maneuvering. At the same time if play needs to happen on the queenside,, then my king will be somewhat safer, if I can maintain a closed center. We'll see.} 19. Nf3 {With this move, white changes all my plans. Remember how earlier I wanted that knight gone from there? It's because of the plan I wished to try, which in retrospect would have been difficult to make work. But now, he puts it back, and it suddenly dawns on me: doh! He has basically thrown a monkey wrench at himself; a new plan suggests itself to me, and I jump on it. Immediately you can see the problem here for white; those are not the pawns he wants to have doubled, and so I immediately make them doubled, because I see what it will do to his dark-squared bishop.} Nxf3+ 20. gxf3 h4 {Now my kingside pawns are going to do their best to keep that dark-squared white bishop out of the action. And at this point of the game I believe I'm better. Fritz doesn't care for what I just did however; he wanted ...Nf8 instead. Which eventually I do; but white is stuck with a real mess, with an imprisoned bishop that will just take too many tempos to free. And of our two bad bishops, his is less active than mine...} 21. a3 {In this position, I'm not sure what white can try. White decides to try to find play on the queenside.} a5 22. Ke2 Ke7 23. Kd2 {With this move, white admits his 22. Ke2 was a bit thoughtless. He thinks to bring his king to the queenside, but his plans are sooooooo slow. And Fritz agrees, not liking this white plan. Here I take a little time to assess, and discover that the queenside is perfectly fine. But I wish to get my knight to d4; and to get my h rook into the action, while keeping my a rook protected. I'm not ready to try any break anywhere yet, until that knight gets to that annoying for white d4 square. So let's get that done...} Rhd8 24. Kc3 Nf8 25. Rhd1 Ne6 26. b4 {And here, I miss an opportunity. I failed to look completely earlier at what will happen on b4. We could have 26. ...axb4 27. axb4 Rxa1 28. Rxa1 cxb4+ and the king can recapture, but the bishop is hanging; no matter what white does, black will win one of the white bishops: if 29. Kc2 Nd4+ and if Kd2, Nxf3+ and the h2 bishop falls; if Kd1 both bishop are attacked after Nxf3. Or if 29. Kd2 then Nc5 and the d3 bishop falls. To prevent this, white could move 27. Kb2; but white's problems continue and black will likely still win a bishop. I, however, had stopped thinking tactically momentarily here, deciding that nothing critical was going on a few moves before. Lesson learned: things change. I can see I'll have to look further ahead in my games at the tactics available.} b6 {So instead I simply move b6. In future positions with similarities, like the e6 knight and d8 rook, I'll be remembering...} 27. Rdb1 Nd4 {And finally the pressure gets to my opponent. Both his bishops are not doing much, and he's nearly desperate for something to do. The game could still end up a draw, even here;  but he chooses now to fight for activity, and doesn't quite get it right. His next few moves are designed to wrest control of the a or perhaps b file, and free up the position a bit. Again there are tactics for me, and this time, they're much more obvious and disastrous for white.} 28. f4 exf4 {Keeping the g file from opening up, and continuing the restriction on that dark-squared bishop. White's 28. f4 is the blunder that loses him the game.} 29. e5 Bxe5 {So he throws away two pawns, in an attempt to open the position. He fails to get the compensation he was looking for however. My f7 pawn will happily support that e5 bishop if needed.} 30. Be4 {This changed the game, even more badly for white. Here I had a bit of a think, looking several moves ahead. It's the same principle tactically, but much more obvious and much worse for white. So obvious, I think everyone here will after some thought see what to do in this position as black.} axb4+ 31. axb4 Ne2+ {Ne2+! I hesitate to give it an exclamation mark because it's so dratted obvious. But this combination wins for black. White plays on, but the outcome is now well in hand.} 32. Kb3 Rxa1 33. Rxa1 Bxa1 34. bxc5 bxc5 35. Kc2 Bd4 36. f3 Rb8 37. Kd2 Rb2+ {And that is how far ahead I looked when he threatened my rook with his bishop; no further than this. Although I thought he'd go after my knight necessitating Nc3 and saving his f pawn that way before my rook would get down there.} 38. Kd1 {White played knowing this was lost. He had one more trick to try.} Nc3+ 39. Kc1 Rxh2 40. Bg6 {Ignore those impulses to capture material, and look at the board. You'll be glad you did. Nice try by white to get a stalemate!} Be3# {My first game I was white against a Sicilian, and although that opponent understood the positions pretty well, he too was a little tentative, and I prevailed. My last game was a real hard fought battle because I blundered in the opening... a trap I knew well and immediately after I moved I was mad at myself. I played some crazy chess against a very strong player in that one, and managed to fight back to a draw where I had the stronger position, but I was worn out. I lucked out in that he was just a little too comfortable in the knowledge he had a winning position! And he did, too. But a small inaccuracy and a little passivity, and I was able to  offer the draw on move 45 in that one. People may joke about it, but seriously; after that game, I literally had a headache from thinking so hard! If anything, that game taught me that I'm not as good as I'd like to be... and hope you've enjoyed this one. Comments welcome!}
