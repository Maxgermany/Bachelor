1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {We play the Nimzo-Indian Defense.} 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd3 d5 6. Nf3 c5 7. O-O b6 8. cxd5 exd5 9. a3 Bxc3 10. bxc3 c4 11. Bc2 Bb7 {I like to fianchetto my bishops if possible. Here it is somewhat delayed.} 12. a4 Nc6 13. Ba3 Re8 14. Rb1 Qc7 15. h3 Rad8 16. Re1 {It´s still kind of even. White are soon ready to the pawn push e4. This move will also make my c4 pawn weak. } Ne4 17. Bxe4 Rxe4 {Because I take back with my e-rook instead of the pawn, I´m avoiding to isolate and weaken my c-pawn. I also have some vague ideas about starting an attack against Whites castled King in the future. } 18. Qc2 Rde8 19. Ng5 {Now begins the trickiest part of the game, with much threats and counterthreats, and maneuvers back and forth!} Rh4 20. Nf3 Rh5 21. Qe2 Rh6 22. Qc2 Bc8 {Aiming at the h3-pawn.} 23. e4 {Now the long anticipated pawn push gets a reality. Tricky position.} Be6 {After a long pondering I find this the best move.} 24. e5 {This move is not so pleasant for me. White gains space here. Probably better for White was exd5. I can´t take back with my Bishop, if I do that I loose my e-Rook! White probably missed that!} Qc8 25. Bc1 Rh5 26. Qe2 Bf5 27. Rb5 {Threatening my d5-pawn.} Qe6 {Combining attack and defense.} 28. Ng5 Qg6 29. Rxd5 {Now my d5-pawn falls!} h6 {But I can live with that. For now I begin to impose a serious threat against Whites King. } 30. g4 {A good defensive move.} Rxg5 31. Bxg5 Qxg5 32. Qf3 Ne7 {Again combining attack and defense.} 33. Rd6 h5 34. Kh2 hxg4 35. hxg4 Bxg4 36. Qg2 Qh4+ 37. Kg1 Nf5 38. Rd5 Re6 { a handy Rook lift.} 39. Re4 Rg6 {Threatening disaster along the g-file.} 40. Rd8+ {I was here pondering pretty long time, accept or reject the sacrifice? But decides to take it.} Qxd8 41. Rxg4 {White wins a Bishop back, but still I´m up in material.} Rxg4 42. Qxg4 Nh6 {To be a Knight up is always nice. Especially when the endgame is near.} 43. Qe4 Qg5+ 44. Kf1 Qc1+ 45. Qe1 Qxe1+ {To trade Queens are the easiest way to win.} 46. Kxe1 Kf8 47. Kd2 Ke7 48. Ke3 a6 49. f3 Nf5+ 50. Kf4 g6 51. Ke4 Ke6 52. d5+ {White tries!} Kd7 53. f4 b5 54. a5 Kc7 55. e6 fxe6 56. dxe6 Kd6 57. e7 Nxe7 {White gives up. And that is right. He is completely lost now.}
