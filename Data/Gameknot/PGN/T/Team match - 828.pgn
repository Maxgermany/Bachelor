1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Bg4 3. e3 Bxf3 4. Qxf3 e6 5. Bd3 {planning e4.} Qf6 {After exchange black would bring his knight with tempo into the game.} 6. Nd2 {symmetrical. I win a tempo after exchange.} Bb4 7. c3 Qxf3 8. Nxf3 Bd6 9. e4 {Without queens, the king can be a fighting piece, that's why I didnot play 0-0.} Nf6 {??} 10. e5 Ne4 11. exd6 Nxd6 12. Bf4 {To make more alternatives, which black must now calculate.} O-O {Black king is in safe, but after exchanges I want to bring in a pawn, that is why the king better stands in the middle.} 13. Bxd6 cxd6 {The pawnstructure is worse.} 14. Kd2 {Make contact between the rooks and centralize the king, too. The black knight has no good place, but must move.} Nc6 15. a3 {Maybe with b4 next, or just for preventing any attack with a and b pawns.} e5 16. Bb5 {I donot want to make better these pawns, so I try to exchange the lightfigures. If the knight goes away, the e5 pawn is over.} exd4 17. Bxc6 dxc3+ 18. Kxc3 {After Rc8 I would play Nd4 safely.} bxc6 19. Rhe1 {The only totally open file to catch.} Rfe8 20. Rxe8+ Rxe8 21. Re1 Rxe1 22. Nxe1 f6 23. Kd4 {Black cannot push the c-pawn, so I made moveless this crowd.} Kf7 24. Nd3 {I want to give my knight for the d5 pawn, to get the a-b-c files, where I can make an isolated pawn, what black must catch, so I get time for win the fight on the kingside and push a pawn in.} Ke6 25. b4 {preventing c5.} a6 26. Nf4+ Kf5 27. Nxd5 cxd5 28. a4 {Kxd5 maybe better, but it doesnot matter anymore.} Ke6 29. b5 axb5 30. axb5 g5 31. b6 Kd7 32. Kxd5 h6 33. g4 {black resigns, because have no pawnmoves and the d6 pawn hangs, so I can make the territory on the kingside mine.}
