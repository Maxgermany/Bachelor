1. e4 {In my last game against Cho, someone suggested a series of moves apparently called the "Wild Traxler". I thought I would try it out. Can anybody explain how it's supposed to work?} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 {blake84120 (1685) on 27-Feb-09: 4. ... Bc5. If 5. Nxf7 then Bxf2 !, 6. Kxf2 Nxe5 , 7. Qg1 Qh4 saves black's queen, threatens mate in 1, and then saves black's rook after white avoids the mate. ... nuntar (1566) on 27-Feb-09: 4... Bc5 is the wild Traxler variation, which is DEFINITELY not recommended to play unless you're well prepared. (For a start, White isn't forced to take the bishop. Do you know how you'd respond?) I'd suggest either sticking with 4... d5 or, if you want to play the Traxler, at least build up a bit of confidence by mastering 4... d5 first.} Bc5 5. Nxf7 Bxf2+ 6. Kxf2 Nxe4+ 7. Kg1 Qf6 {So now I would be threatening checkmate in 1, and be able to save my rook while white defends it's king...theoretically...but...} 8. Qf3 {It seems as if I would lose my knight in the process? (This is me playing against myself from here.)} Rf8 9. Qxe4 Rxf7 10. Bxf7+ Qxf7 {White's position sucks, but black is still behind a wopping 4 points.} 11. Qxh7 {Make that five.} b6 12. d3 Bb7 13. Qh8+ Ke7 14. Qh4+ Ke8 {This is going much worse than my actual game went.} 15. Qf2 Qd5 16. Bg5 Nd4 17. Na3 Qc6 18. c3 Nf5 {Nice trap for white's queen here. Unfortunately there's no way I can fool myself.} 19. Re1 d6 20. d4 Qd5 21. c4 Qxd4 22. Qxd4 Nxd4 {It seems like I as black with my fancy wild Trexler variation has basically lost the game. I don't see how this was supposed to work.} 23. h4 Kd7 24. Rh3 Ba6 25. b3 Rg8 26. Rg3 c5 27. Be3 Ne6 28. Rf1 Ke7 29. Nc2 Bb7 30. Bg5+ Ke8 31. Rf5 Be4 32. Rf2 a5 33. Re2 Bc6 34. a3 Rh8 35. Rd2 Kd7 36. b4 Ba4 37. bxa5 bxa5 38. Rgd3 Bxc2 39. Rxc2 Ra8 40. Rcd2 Ra6 41. Be3 Nc7 42. h5 Ke6 43. h6 gxh6 44. Bxh6 a4 45. Bf8 Ne8 46. g4 Kf6 47. Bxd6 Ra5 48. Rd3d5 Kg5 49. Rg2 Kf4 50. Bxe5+ Kf3 51. g5 Ke4 52. g6 Kf5 53. g7 Nxg7 54. Rxg7 Ke6 55. Bc7 Ra7 56. Rxc5 Kf6 57. Rd7 Ke6 58. Rcd5 Ra8 59. Rd7d6+ Ke7 60. Rh5 Ra7 61. Rh7+ Ke8 62. Rd8# {Yup black loses. (GG, me.) Does this wild Traxler depend on your opponent being a patzer? or is there something to it I'm not seeing?}
