[Round "1"]
[White "R.J. (Bobby) Fischer "]
[Black "Tigran Petrosian "]
[Opening "Caro-Kann (B11), two knights, 3...Bg4"]

1. e4 {(This game was Round 16 of the Bled-Zagreb-Belgrade Candidates Chess Tournament, this particular game played I believe in Zagreb, Yugoslavia.) Fischer opens with e4, a widely known trademark of his. He was about 16 years old around the time of this tournament. You'll find people saying that d4 has more success in grandmaster play, but Fischer was apparently not one of those grandmasters who'd ever claim or play such a thing. e4 was his preference in the opening.} c6 {And "Iron Tiger" Petrosian opens with the Caro-Kann. I'm less sure of his frequency to play passive openings like the Caro-Kann, but from what I hear, his attention and accuracy in regard to defense was one of the most unique qualities to him in particular. So it goes, he was one of the most difficult grandmasters ever to actually defeat...} 2. Nc3 {More popular is 2. d4 nowadays. Nc3 seems okay, but a tad passive in comparison IMO.} d5 {Common for Black, and the best reply, I think as well.} 3. Nf3 {And Fischer tries to possess the center using his two knights. The approach is fine, but in the Flohr varation (2. d4 d5, Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4), White looks fine and comfortable with maneuverability, and I've found this in my own experiences with the opening as well. Instead, when playing Two Knights here, White has to concern himself with...} Bg4 {And frankly, early knight pins are annoying! Perhaps this is why we see 2. d4 played more often.} 4. h3 {Fischer doesn't seem so easily annoyed by opening pins, however, and invites Black's reply.} Bxf3 {More common is this. If the bishop is already here, you might as well not lose tempo to bring it back.} 5. Qxf3 {And the Queen takes. Personally, I also avoid (g/b)x(f/c)(3/6) whenever possible. It tends to be a nasty hole in the pawn structure, and it just isn't worth the hassle when another back rank piece is within reach to capture instead... mostly. White usually castles short here as well...} Nf6 {Black can now take advantage of the lonely e4 pawn. White's going to need to be a bit more passive in development now, making sure to cover all bases before launching a strike.} 6. d3 {Fischer plays this double-edged move. Once again I'm going to go on a bit more of an opening rant- it's a fair move, guarding e4 again and letting the dark bishop come into the game to target g5 eventually, but it also traps the light bishop. Meaning, if White is planning to castle kingside, it's all too obvious what the best plan that way will be- g3 has to be played, followed by Bg2, and then O-O. Otherwise, the light bishop takes on e2, but that won't be very effective if e4 is being pressured like this. So I feel as though Fischer is making his motives a little too obvious here for Petrosian. All in all, I just don't think two-knights is an ideal opening for White to play himself into.} e6 {Still, Petrosian seems to form his own agenda. With his own light bishop already gone, he brings the other into the game. He's already used the most ideal piece to harass White's f3 with, which is a tad unfortunate. Black looks solid so far...} 7. g3 {And as I thought, now Fischer begins his K-side fianchetto plans, eyeing to castle short.} Bb4 {Petrosian puts a halt to that plan by setting up yet another harassing bishop pin. He seems to really enjoy bishop -> knight trades, but his plan appears sound.} 8. Bd2 {Playing anything else would force bxc3 after Bxc3+, again threatening to disrupt White's pawns.} d4 {Petrosian is relentless about that knight. It's almost as though we've got a hit called on a simple horse. Well, they are in the right time period for that, I guess? At any rate, I'm not sure I see better moves, but I don't know if I can commit to the effect that perhaps Black is overreaching here. Yet if I were going to play anything else, it'd have been O-O, and I suppose that'd have been a tad passive.} 9. Nb1 {This is forced. If the knight doesn't move, then dx. The only other decent looking square is then Ne2, but if White plays that, then...} Bxd2+ {...White's king would be forced to capture. Now, as for Black, the saying goes again: "If the bishop is already here, you might as well not lose tempo to bring it back." Perhaps a little less true here than with the other bishop. Could Bd6 have helped any?} 10. Nxd2 {The knight now comes to rescue White's castling rights, but Black is holding the initiative. White is slightly ahead in development, but Black can grab space more easily on the board. White has slightly more use of his back pieces, but...} e5 {Black's pawns have more potential to inhibit White's ability to grab more control of the white squares after the fianchetto. With e4 stuck in place, the White Queen is virtually forced to move away eventually in order to free Fischer's ability to stake a claim to the kingside. The game is still early, but I'm pegging Black to have a slight edge over White here. I think there's a few more choices over the opposition, and for every bonus White has, Black has one too, but the drawbacks seem slightly harsher against White. } 11. Bg2 {The bishop fianchetto's itself anyway. It's a bit tragic for White, I would think. If it weren't for the pawn on d4 (pretty much safe to break ONLY via White's c3), I would have strongly considered O-O-O. This just takes longer to set up, and with e4 frozen in place, I get a sense that White now needs to waste some valuable time fixing his defenses instead of developing further. If long castling looked better for White, perhaps he could have been able to save himself said time needed to adjust himself. And yet again, I hold the two knights variation responsible for Fischer's troubles here... This all being said, I did decide to annotate this game for a reason... ;)} c5 {If White was ever going to be able to stop Black from seizing the Queenside, that hope is almost impossible now. This is now the foundation of the interesting dynamic of the game situation. White's only real contest starts with his cramped kingside. Black is free to win the queenside by storm. Both sides just kinda start ignoring the other's threats from here, for the most part, and it causes some pretty cool results...} 12. O-O {Anyway, as I've already said, White's kingside castling was forced upon him. This was the case since 6. d3, otherwise other moves could have made O-O-O possible.} Nc6 {Black is now hurrying to gain more ground on the Queenside, hoping to pierce through into the back rank through that way. For good reason- White really doesn't have a lot of choices to stop any firm push that way, and has no time to build defenses over there.} 13. Qe2 {The White Queen takes its forced move in order to free the f-pawn to disrupt Black's e5 pawn. The only real good square for the queen, as Qd1 would just confine the a-rook to the queenside.} Qe7 {Conversely, the Black Queen is moved here, enabling O-O-O and helping to defend e5 further.} 14. f4 {Finally! Fischer can start gathering some space again. But Black still has a lot of choices in what happens next, so there's still a lot of work White needs to do to pull himself back into the game...} O-O-O {Black finally castles. Eh, maybe this could have happened a bit later? The Black King looked rather secure to me. A move like Nd7 would help strengthen e5, c5, and overall kingside defenses. I don't think f5 as a response from White would be all that helpful either- Black has no more bishops to block, and the key diagonal to the Black King would be sealed by such a move.} 15. a3 {Whereas Black castling now seems to help White pick up a tempo. I'm not sure if Fischer thought that Nb4 was too worrying, but even White's next move could have been hindered if other things had happened...} Ne8 {But Petrosian doesn't seem too concerned. What's more- I suppose that if he delayed castling, the knight wouldn't end up here and fall onto its next square. I'm really wondering if he instead just simply kept the knight on d7. Given what Fischer ends up doing, it's unclear to me how that would have played out for Black...} 16. b4 {This is where the position starts looking a little unclear, and it doesn't exactly clear up from here on out. Nc6 and the Black Queen are both guarding b4 and e5, but White is attacking both pieces at once- and say if ...cxb4, axb4, Black cannot play Nxb4, or else White plays Rxa7! But White now threatens b5- at the expense of his own tempo to break Black's defenses... on the kingside. Despite the semi-open nature of the board, it's gotten itself fairly tangled up in the last four moves!} cxb4 {I don't think it's sensible to let White capture on c5, but the only things standing between the King and a White rook being a knight and an enemy pawn is a bit concerning to me, if I were Black.} 17. Nc4 {And it looks like said knight on c6 is going to be needed in a little bit, so I'd be even more concerned by this point. Petrosian, on the other hand, seems to be quite comfortable with where his King is for the time being, and even seems to flaunt that later...} f6 {But White winning undisputed control over e5 is a concern that needs to be addressed, so out comes this pawn to stop White from pushing further into the Black camp. (I'm still wondering about if Black had the other knight on d7!)} 18. fxe5 {White pierces the e5 pawn, starting to crack into the wall stopping e4 from pushing further...!} fxe5 {But Black is still ready to defend himself. White would like to play Rf5, I'm sure, but g6 from Black might cause a bit of trouble. Around here I imagine Fischer woke up again and realized that he's down material again...} 19. axb4 {So he neutralizes once again, probably wondering how he can proceed with any sensible attack. It still looks like Black has plenty of options to respond here.} Nc7 {This knight is really starting to raise a lot of questions from me. I just have to wonder. Why couldn't Black play Nxb4 or Qxb4? And if that reason involves e5 losing too many defenses, then would Nd7 not have helped Black's capture on b4? I think Petrosian's setup here is cool, but I clearly don't view my defenses the way he does. I guess I'm a bit too tactical in my thinking for my own good. I personally don't see any good having to wait for White to play b5, once that move actually starts to look promising.} 20. Na5 {Fischer starts to threaten some disruption in Black's structure for a change of pace, as opposed to Black's tricks way back with all the Bishop pinning.} Nb5 {And this was a nice call by Petrosian, because I don't think White has a threat that way anymore. If White captures, it just accelerates Black's ability to keep a hold on b5, which should harm White's ability to counterplay here and to focus more on the squeezed kingside instead.} 21. Nxc6 {White doesn't seem to mind that thought though, instead hoping to simplify a bit more on the board. Fischer always did like his rooks, but that bishop is virtually dead on g2. I don't know about the exchange of his final, active minor back piece, when Black still has the other knight with plenty of room to control the board. This entire setup is not done looking complex, but still...} bxc6 {...I just have to think that e4 is terribly crippling White here. Black looks solid, easily maneuverable, and even though e5 is looking a bit stranded, White's going to have to make some tough calls and sacrifices in order to stay in the game. I get that Bobby was only 16, and only improved his games from here, but ouch. I can't say this looks hopeful for him. And yet...} 22. Rf2 {Planning to stack the rooks, hoping to attack Black's seemingly only weakness- the 7th rank.} g6 {I'm assuming Petrosian sensed a need to defend e5 via stopping both Rf5 and Qh5 from White, but I dare say this kinda misses the point? I would think that if White was planning either move, g6 would be a stopping move after the fact. Playing it now seems a bit premature to me.} 23. h4 {I mean, I'm not sure what Black could have done instead... (I want to say Qxb4, but I see Rf7 causing Black some grief), but I think playing g6 right then is just disrupted further by this. I'm not too sure about my analysis here. As I've said before, the board looks awfully unclear, and I don't think I'd have handled this the way the two grandmasters played it out.} Kb7 {Anyway, interesting enough, Black comes up with this, and I'm actually very fond of this move. I love games where the King suddenly assumes the role of a key defender in weaknesses, and Petrosian is quite well known for this playstyle. From here, I feel Black starts making a lot of good choices, capitalizing on the great placements of his King from here following.} 24. h5 {Next comes this, but White shouldn't be extremely keen on taking on g6 right away- if hxg6, hxg6, Black would have a rook screaming down the h-file, where White's King looks potentially exploitable after potentially dealing with the g6 pawn. Black doesn't end up focusing on that though...} Qxb4 {Again, here especially is where it seems to be White and Black having two overall plans to control opposite sides of the board, and not do much to hinder one or the other. Black gains a bit of a material edge here, but it's rather short-lived, and hard to say if too much came from this capture in the end.} 25. Rf7+ {White can finally start grabbing hold of the open 7th rank now, forcing the King to reconsider safe squares to be on, and targetting a7/h7.} Kb6 {Petrosian simply decides on this square. The Black King is now guarding even more pieces, and it's not confined to the back rank either. It's not even done walking yet- this is just the beginning of the King's morning stroll! However, at the very least for White, c4 is starting to look a little more promising...} 26. Qf2 {Fischer continues planning an all out assault on Black's back ranks. However...} a5 {...now Black can begin threatening his own threats against White's back rank, should Fischer find no decent way to stop this passed pawn from Queening.} 27. c4 {White hits the knight. Black would love to capture en passant- unfortunately the pin is stopping that from being possible. The knight must move.} Nc3 {Even if White's queen was on f1, this proves that Rb1 was never going to be possible to pin the Black Queen. This knight is just menacing White's defenses now, and Black still has a lot of control of his space. I'm fascinated by this, really- despite e5 and the kingside pawns being a clear weakness, Black's degree of controlling the board due to the use of the queenside advantage is just so cool to see unfold into a balanced game here...} 28. Rf1 {White's rook was never getting anything done on a1 anyway. It's no good to keep the rook on the a file anyway, because that pawn is protected on every single square except for the final promoting one. White must move carefully, and watch the time he spends pushing, because it's impossible to stop Black's promotion threat now.} a4 {Moves before a1=Q: 3.} 29. Qf6 {Moves before h5 promotes: 4+. So White's solution is to threaten a rook fork- if 30. Rxh7, Rxh7, then White plays Qxd8...!} Qc5 {Now as for this... I'm not sure what the Queen's doing here that she wasn't doing on b4. Why did Petrosian need this? Wouldn't a3 be better? Or was White's c5+ actually threatening?} 30. Rxh7 {Anyway, White finally balances the material again, but it's still going to come at a crucial tempo cost...} Rdf8 {Now that the rook is off f7, White can no longer brute-force the rooks on the back rank without losing the Queen in the process.} 31. Qxg6 {So White simply allows for the pawn to advance further.} Rxh7 {But before that, Petrosian is going to force the White Queen to get in the way of the pawn again, and that's going to put Fischer enough of moves behind promotion now to at least warrant annoyance.} 32. Qxh7 {Likewise. Moves before h8=Q: 4.} Rxf1+ {Black finishes trading the rook pairs, and to put White over a move behind in tempo is easily worth the trade, I think. I'm not sure if Black could have handled that any better, honestly...} 33. Bxf1 {Why not Kxf1? Could Black really harass anything with Qf8+?} a3 {Moves before a1=Q: 2.} 34. h6 {Moves before h8=Q: 3.} a2 {Moves before a1=Q: 1!!!} 35. Qg8 {Moves before h8=Q: 2.} a1=Q {Promotion! Although, I suppose, looking at this again, had White played Kxf1 after the rook check, this Queen suddenly appearing on a1 would be a lot of cause for concern, but even so... White's bishop is stuck dead AGAIN, this time pinned by a second queen...!} 36. h7 {White's only hope is to start making threats with a second queen on the board, but is still plenty of tempo behind Black right now.} Qd6 {I imagine Petrosian stopping to have a think here. He has a second queen now? Great! Now that he has it, what to do? Surprisingly enough, if Ne2+, the bishop may not be able to capture, but seems to provide White's King all the necessary defenses against even two queens for Black's desperate queen-prevention plan to eventually run out of steam. So instead, I suppose the original Black Queen goes here, in other to stop the original White Queen from perpetualing the Black King into either a draw, or losing the a1=Q. So close, and yet, so unfortunate, Petrosian!!!} 37. h8=Q {And so it begins, a game that is "highly unrealistic to have four queens on the board", as White and Black now try to figure out how to maneuver themselves into a winning position. Hey! You two grandmasters over there! Stop trying to compose puzzles and go back to playing a "realistic" tournament game! Don't make us throw the rulebook at you against having four queens on the board! (I jest, but even still, I find the whole argument to be a tad bit... close-minded at times. :P)} Qa7 {Anyway, the second queen realizes her attack is incomplete, and retreats to defend Black's back rank here. Even in spite of so many pieces falling off the board at this point, it's really hard to say just how clear the position is, isn't it?} 38. g4 {I'm a bit surprised Fischer did this- maybe a reminder to Petrosian that White still has a passed pawn? Still, I kinda find this move weak... did his queens really have nowhere worth going?} Kc5 {"Alright ladies, I'm going on another stroll to refresh my thoughts!" And the Black King walks off, leaving the mess of his home behind. Vintage Petrosian, everyone! *bows* In all seriousness, I feel like if Black's King could somehow break a key defense at the core of the board, White would be in a lot of trouble. Maybe he really has the right idea (possibility even inviting a trade via Qd5+?) but the board looks very twisted right now, and it's difficult to say what's going to happen next. Surely if either side blunders, it's going to be fatal.} 39. Qgf8 {I guess Fischer would like to trade a queen pair, but realizes that Black has far more of a grip on d5, than he does on d6. Black can't play Qxf8 either, or else White's Qxf8 is check. Hmm...} Qae7 {I would consider this sound, really. Now White's Queen (the original one), has to run off somewhere again, because Black can now hold the position after trading. Where could Fischer put it...?} 40. Qfa8 {Good eye by Fischer- a3 looks particularly weak! Even so, there's just one tiny, yet amazing hiccup to White's plan here...} Kb4 {Namely, Black's King seems awfully at ease with pondering life's questions while all these queens wonder what to do about him. Now Black defends a3 with just his King, and it works so beautifully. The dynamic of this complex position is just captivating. Personally, I've long given up on trying to predict the two grandmasters at this point, because Queen combinations really exhaust the imagination of trying to find White's and Black's best moves. I'm just stuck trying to interpret what they're thinking at this point. } 41. Qh2 {I'm sure Fischer spent a lot of time considering the position as well. Let's consider- say if White had instead moved Qhb8. Then Black plays Qxb8, meeting White's Qxb8+. Does White have a perpetual? If he did, should he pursue it? Earlier I'd state that I think Black had a clear edge over White, but now? The board looks far too unclear now to state one over at the other at this point. I wonder what engine analysis would have to say about this game...?} Kb3 {Black's King continues his stroll... guarding all three weakpoints (a3, a2, b2) at once from TWO QUEENS! The knight can now help solve Qa4 and Q(a/h)a2, and the two Black Queens are helping fight off Qa3 and Qb8. I just can't help but be so entertained by Black's magic behind his King Gladiator play here. How could a person ever defend a King from two freaking queens so well by mainly just using his king?!} 42. Qa1 {I'm sure Fischer tried as hard as he could to find an opening in that incredible defense, but this marks the final straw. If he can't join the queens on b2, then Black, despite being so open and flamboyant in the central fray, is completely solid, even despite the screaming rage from two of the strongest piece in Chess. Worse, if White relented now, it'd just give Black the opportunity to use his Queens again.} Qda3 {But Petrosian knows his defenses are virtually complete if b2 is guarded, which he does here. White is forced to give up a queen pair, or give up tempo. Truly brilliant play from Petrosian. Although I hear he was quite exhausted by now with all the combinations at this point- I can't say I blame him!} 43. Qxa3+ {Fischer opts to simplify at long last, rather than lose even more tempo this match.} Kxa3 {Hmm, and Petrosian continues to allow his King to ponder life's questions instead of capturing with Queen. Although, I do suppose that capturing with Queen could be a bit more dangerous- Fischer's king is safe where it is right now, and a Queen on a3 really wouldn't be doing much as is.} 44. Qh6 {But if this Queen couldn't go to its next square, perhaps Black would be more compromised without as many alternatives, so I'm going to keep applauding Petrosian's masterful King maneuvers.} Qf7 {f3 is looking pretty weak for White right now! If Qxc6 now by White, Qf3 freezes everything on White's kingside, and probably could mean mate...!!!} 45. Kg2 {RJF isn't letting that slip by! But there's still a lot that needs to be done...} Kb3 {Hmm, more king strolling? I guess Qd6 threatens more to Black than Qxc6, then. } 46. Qd2 {And here, I can only imagine White being concerned about that knight making it to d1, threatening Qf2, at least losing the bishop and probably the King shortly after. But this pretty much confines the White Queen to more of a defensive role for the rest of the match- there's no way to check the Black King effectively from the White back ranks...} Qh7 {Petrosian exploits this, having a certain threat in mind. Can you spot it before continuing?} 47. Kg3 {White plays this. Now, why? What did Fischer see? } Qxe4 {He saw that Black had this. White can't play Qxc3+, because then Black promotes a third queen after dxc3 (the light bishop is too confined to stop promotion). Meanwhile, if White just plays dxe4, then that obviously loses after Nxe4+!!! Black has now balanced the material again, with White's defenses clearly showing its awkwardness once and for all. Now, had White's King remained on g2, this would be check. But I have to wonder- what happens if White had played 47. Qe1 instead?} 48. Qf2 {The White Queen moves out of the range of the knight before more trouble ensues.} Qh1 {And finally, the Black Queen goes here, controlling the h-file and allowing for e4 (but d4 must be defended first, or else Qxd4). Oddly enough, Fischer offers a draw here, and Petrosian accepts it. I'm going to fall back to say that I believe Black has a slight edge here, just because his control of the Queenside remained dominant throughout the match and is now relevant to the position at hand. But I suppose Petrosian was exhausted after that wonderful display of defense. I can't say for sure, but I thought this game was amazing- it was nice to see Fischer recover and display his sharp wit, even in a disadvantaged position, but Petrosian's king walk was just too fun to watch unfold. Fun fact- both survived queens are the newly promoted ones! That all aside, I hope you enjoyed this match as much as I did! Thanks for reading this annotation! :)}
