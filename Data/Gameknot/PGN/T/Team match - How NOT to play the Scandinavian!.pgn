1. e4 {This was great fun for me but must have been torture for my poor opponent.  Our grades were much closer at the start of the match, so it's not a case of a simple crushing by a better player, just a case of an unfortunate series of opening errors that were duly punished.} d5 {The Scandinavian, or Centre-Counter, is a tricky opening, so both players have to be on the ball.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. d4 {All standard stuff so far.} Qe4+ {? but this is not recommended by the books.} 4. Be2 Qxg2 {Black goes chasing material at the cost of development.} 5. Bf3 Qg6 6. Ne2 Qf5 {? Another unnecessary Queen move when all his other pieces are still at home.} 7. Ng3 {The Q is chased away, the B protected and the g-file covered all in one move.} Qa5+ 8. Bd2 {Once again, the Q provides White with a tempo for development.} Qb5 {This at least prevents castling and again threatens to win material with ...Qxb2} 9. Nc3 {Black is welcome to expend another tempo for the insignificant b-pawn.  White's minor pieces are gaining control of the board.} Qxb2 10. Rb1 Qa3 11. O-O {White completes his development and Black still only has his Queen out.  9 out of Black's first 10 moves have been Queen moves.} c6 {and then this non-Queen move is a pawn move that doesn't help develop any pieces.  In fact it deprives the Nb8 of its best square.  While this is a standard move in the Scandinavian, it is usually several moves earlier as part of a plan to preserve the Q.  Now there were far more relevant moves to be made.} 12. Re1 {White takes aim at the centrally stranded King.} e6 13. Rb3 Qe7 {This saves the Q for the time being but deprives King, Bishop and Knight of a useful square.} 14. Nf5 {The N takes advantage of the pin on the pawn to attack the Q again.} g6 {?! or ?? depending on whether it was deliberate.  Black ignores the attack on the Q and belatedly starts to provide the space to develop his pieces.  Having invested so many tempi in the Q it seems strange to give it up now.  Perhaps it was just a blundering oversight.} 15. Nxe7 Nxe7 16. Ne4 {White immediately heads for the holes at f6 and d6.} Nd5 {Black covers the holes by placing his N on a good square, albeit this is a second move with the one remaining developed piece.} 17. Bg5 Nd7 {Now the second N reinforces the defence of f6.  It's a pity Black has lost his Q as his pawns look solid but draughty.  White can have a party on the black squares.} 18. c3 {A mysterious little move.  I'm not sure now why I played it: probably to bolster the d-pawn so that the Q would not be tied to its defence after the inevitable ...Bg7} b6 19. c4 {Now that Black has deprived his N of its best retreat square, I push the pawn forward again to dislodge it.} Nc7 {Now White's path to victory is a smooth one.} 20. Nf6+ Nxf6 21. Bxf6 Rg8 22. d5 Bc5 23. dxe6 {This threatens mate in 1} Bb7 {This defends against that threat but not the next.  23.. Bxe6 would have been slightly better.} 24. Qd7+ Kf8 25. Qxf7# {}
