1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Bf5 3. c4 c6 4. Qb3 Qc8 {A horrible blunder. 4... Q-N3 was necessary.} 5. cxd5 {Caro immediately begins opening attacking lines.} cxd5 {Forced, if material equality is to be maintained.} 6. Nc3 {Developing and attacking the weakened QP.} e6 {Defending, but falling even farther behind in development.} 7. Bf4 {Clearing the square for the Rook to seize the open file.} a6 {Desperation.} 8. Na4 {Threatening R-B1.} Ra7 {Black may as well resign.} 9. Nb6 {A rusty nail in Lasker's knee or a bone in his throat. Pick your metaphor.} Qd8 {Losing yet another tempo.} 10. Bxb8 {Removing a defender.} Qxb8 {Completing the exchange.} 11. Qa4+ {The monarch must bestir himself.} Ke7 {Forced [11... K-Q1 12 Q-Q7 mate.]} 12. Rc1 {Leaving Black defenceless.} g5 {As good or bad as anything else.} 13. Ne5 {13 N-B8 ch would win the Exchange, but White is after bigger game. The threat is 14 Q-Q7 ch K-B3 15 QxBP mate.} Nh6 {If 13... N-B3, White has 14 N-B8 ch K-Q1 15 NxP mate.} 14. Nc8+ {Lasker resigns. He has the grisly choice between losing his Q [14... QxN 15 RxQ, 14... K-B3 15 N-Q7 ch forking K and Q] or his K [14... K-Q1 15 Q-Q7 mate.]}
