Qa5 was a better move, the castle is lost now} 10. Bxf8 Kxf8 11. Bd3 Qg5 12. g3 Bg4 13. Qd2 Qd5 14. f3 Bxf3 15. Nxf3 Qxf3 {This pawn was too expensive. It should be different with castle} 16. Rf1 Qh5 17. Rb1 b6 18. Rb5 Qh3 19. Qf4 f6 20. Be4 e5 21. Qf3 Qe6 {A stupid mistake. I was under pressure. However, 21 .. exd4 maybe saves the situation} 22. d5 Qd6 23. dxc6 Qa3 24. c7 Rc8 25.

Bg2+ Kf4 58. Bh3 Ke4 59. Bg2+ Kf4 {I didn't see any way to win and opponent too...  This game has a several parts. I had done one serious game mistake and several tactical mistakes like my opponent. I thing, that the game mistakes are not cleanable (we are humans), however tactical mistakes are very instructive...}
