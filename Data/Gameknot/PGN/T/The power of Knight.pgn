1. e4 c5 {Great oppening for the dioagonal of the black Q.} 2. d4 {Not so clever} cxd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 {What else?} 4. Qd1 e5 5. Nf3 {The smart Knight attack begins...!!!} Nf6 6. Bg5 {Pin of the black queen.} h6 7. Bxf6 {Taking knight for bishop is my favorite.} Qxf6 {This was black's first mistake. He had his queenside open and he choose to defend with his queen.} 8. Nc3 {Now i could open my knight without the fear of pinning by the Q.} Bc5 {Maybe b4 would be better?} 9. Nd5 {Two black pinnings were over...} Qd8 {... and the queen retreats!} 10. Bc4 {supporting my knight} O-O {why not moving the Q to a5?} 11. g3 {having my kingside ready for roke} Nd4 {this was a relief, this black pawn at e5 was quite a pressure} 12. Nxe5 f6 {if there are two knights in the same raw is a great attack} 13. Nxf6+ {double check} Kh8 14. Ng6# {the power of Knights!!!}
