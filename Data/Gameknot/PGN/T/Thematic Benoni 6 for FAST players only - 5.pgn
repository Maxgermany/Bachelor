1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 {First 6 moves of the good 'ol Benoni 6 (A65) } 7. Bf4 {perhaps white should wait a little to make this move, as the bishop could be harassed by Nh5 now. Bf4 is indeed a good move, though, and I didn't play Nh5. } Qe7 {Developing the queen and hitting e4. Looking back I think Nh5 is better. } 8. Nb5 {A surprising move, indeed, but not a bad one. I think however, better for white is Nf3, or maybe Qc2. Both moves save e4 and give white good position. (If 8)Nf3 Nxe4 9)Qa5  wins a piece). Instead, the following moves leave black in an at least okay situation. I feel that white was better after my not so hot Qe7 move. } Qxe4+ 9. Qe2 {..forced.} Qxe2+ 10. Bxe2 {This is the situation I assume white saw when he played Nb5. He'll lose a pawn, but have nice pressure on the black king and invasive pieces in return. } Nxd5 {I could have tryed to hold the position with Kd7, and probably should have. Another mini mistake for me. } 11. Bxd6 {I really think Nxd6  with the bishop pair for white is stronger. } Bxd6 12. Nxd6+ Ke7 13. Nxc8+ Rxc8 14. Bf3 {Setting up an odd position. } Nb4 {The only move that doesn't fail materialwise..} 15. Bxb7 Nc2+ 16. Ke2 Nxa1 17. Bxc8 {Hard to believe this is a mistake of a move, but it is. Nf3 is better, as the rooks remain forked, and the black knight must scurry away. } Nc6 18. Nf3 Nc2 19. Bh3 Rb8 20. Rb1 {A mistake, losing a pawn. } Na3 21. Rd1 Rxb2+ 22. Rd2 Rb7 23. Bc8 {It looks like a fine move, but white is getting his bishop in the line of fire. } Rc7 24. Ba6 {Rd3 is much much stronger. } Nb4 {White's bishop is going to either hang or be the stepladder to black promoting the c pawn. The game is over. } 25. Bd3 c4 {If the bishop doesn't fall now, it will soon. }
