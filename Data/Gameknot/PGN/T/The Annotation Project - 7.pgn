1. e4 {So I am annotating this game,  for one reason, I haven't annotated but one other and I only got about halfway through the game doing it ...  then finished it out later.  The other reason is as per my comment to my opponent... "I am going to annotate this one since I only partially annotated another, also, annotating against a superior player may help, or at least be humorous reading..."} c5 {The Game begins with the first few moves set ...  I think it is safe to say that it's a messed up opening.} 2. f4 {I have never done this myself,  don't intend to..} d5 {I mean why in the heck would anyone open up his king side like this??} 3. Nf3 {I just don't see it, call me a moron,  } dxe4 {yeah,  i can see black doing that} 4. Ng5 {...no sense in just giving it away...} Nf6 {.....} 5. Bc4 {....ok  at least that made sense,  for someone planning on sacrificing the Queen} Bg4 {yep...  here we go} 6. Qxg4 {and there she goes...} Nxg4 {So here we are,  with the lovely set-up ..  me as white and down 7 points...  yeah,  against a player what...  500 or more points better rated...I should resign and open the bottle,  it would make for a better evening...  but the morning may be rough...so I play on...} 7. Bxf7+ {there isn't much to do here at this point} Kd7 {he enters in some conditional moves...} 8. Be6+ {I trigger them of course... } Kc7 {I must be a crappy player if he can guess all my moves,  I wonder how far this will go} 9. Bxg4 {I have to get some material back.so now I am only down what...  a queen to a Knight and a Bishop?} Qe8 {so I think this is new...  } 10. Ne6+ {The temptation is to take e4 and get material back,  but I am thinking the more I can keep his King from being in a happy place the better off I am.  then there is the deal with his knight getting down there and forking me at c2.  I have been killed by that.  where is the rum???} Kb6 {MAN!  another conditional move triggered !  how many games of this has he played???!!!  I better check the mini tournament board....  and run to the liquor store...} 11. Na3 {I check the tourney board,  Easy19 has played 10 and won 10,  I check the clock,  still time to get to the liquor store....  I can't stand the aforementioned knight fork ..  so I am going to "cut my knight in half" to guard against it, and be able to harass his king again later..} a6 {I guess he is looking for a safe place to tuck the king....} 12. Nc4+ {one of the few times a move has just jumped out for me.  i see a couple of places he can put his king now, and a couple of things favorable for me to respond with.  My head still hurts from a 'lack of caffeine hangover'  but the Penguins beat Detroit last night in game 7, and I am absorbing coffee as fast as I can..  Life is good...  now  if i could just win the lottery and buy a blow-up doll factory...} Ka7 {ok,  so  now I follow through with my 'Plan'  } 13. Nc7 {a Knight fork,  maybe i get 2 points back and stuff the king in a corner, possibly buying me some time to get mine in a safe place...  I still don't like it....  I wonder if possible he will be gracious and give me the Lady....I would like that...  move 13..  it would be nice to have a plan....} Qf7 {sooo,  I guess he isn't that interested in my Knight at c7 on the return trip (if i ever do extract it), a greater interest on my weak king side...  and knight at c4,  sure why not...  ok  not a lot of options here...  through my bishop down to e6 giving up the f pawn..  or.......} 14. d3 {yeah,  open up my stuck black bishop...I am still kind of hurt that easy doesn't want to donate at least 1 point in this tourney to some lucky person ....  it's Saturday...  wonder if i can get to the gym...  maybe the liquor store...  which one first....  hmmm...} Nc6 {this is no big surprise  had to ahppen sooner or later} 15. Nxa8 {I sieze my opportunity to be up in points for like...  half a move.... AND   I put in a conditional move ..  This should be good  !!!!!} Kxa8 {oh !  I get to exercise my conditional move !!!} 16. Be3 {WOW a conditional move against a 2200 !!!!} exd3 {he has a few of his own.... :-(} 17. cxd3 {not much I can do here  I kind of like my knight...} Qg6 {ok,  so his little bitch is continuing to give me hell,  now why did I agree to this tourney...?  I am thinking that since the gym is one of those 24/7 places,  the liquor store should come first...  it is already noon here...} 18. Bf3 {I have to decide which pawn to save (and maybe my a$$)..  I figure maybe if i can tuck my king nicely into a corner like he did,  I can ...  awww...  I won't be able to do crap but maybe last till move 30....} Qxd3 {well,  there I go,  back down another pawn,  I wonder if i offered the sultry little wh0re a couple of grand if she would go away....} 19. Rc1 {Just figured out I don't have a couple grand to offer...  I'm a married man...  who btw desperately needs a drink...  I am still hoping to push my friend there out of the middle of my playground,  so i can get some safety...} g5 {ah !!!  he applies more pressure,,,  } 20. Be2 {I do the same...  my pressure trumps his......  maybe...} Qg6 {so he backed off,  I made the mistake of going to the gym first rather than the liquor store. the loss of oxygen to my brain is causing typos and certainly not helping me come up with a good response...  why i n the hell can't I think more than 2 moves ahead?  I guess I will check my still,  it has to have a move in there..} 21. Nb6+ {well now I am pissed,  not only have my muscles robbed my brain of thinking oxygen, but my sweet mash is tired from the too high ph and not making alcohol,  going to have to add some sour (mash) after all and ruin the taste of the bourbon I had going, damn !...  i make a move... any move,  to stall till my brain returns to normal...  like it matters ...} Ka7 {so he moves his king up attacking my knight,whoopee,  tghe liquor store is getting better,  wonder if there is a law about driving without oxygen on the brani..and ,,,  does tghe body break down ethanol to free up the the oxygen??/  i could use some o2 right about now...} 22. Bxc5 {i get a pawn back  to make me feel good for a min,  this is kind of like standing around the bonfires on the coast where tehe NARCs are burening the bales of pot thrown overboard by the shrimpers from Biloxi in rough seas,,  feels pretty good at the time,  but there just seems to be something sinister about it...} e5 {so now he wants my pawn there...this is really beginning to suck,  well  actually  it started around move..6,  no  when I accepted the Project invite... this isn't helping my rating any,  well  I don't see any advantage to taking either pawn, g5 then Qx thus attacking g2 AND R at c1.  if i take e5,  then... Bxc5 and there is no nice thing there....  soo I will do....} 23. f5 {THIS !  ha! give him a pawn...  lets see what he does....maybe one day i will come up with an idea ...  there weren't any at the store,  and I decided on less liquor today...  mostly cause my neighbor wants to take his alcoholic wife out and I will watch the kids...and I won't drink around her at all.} Qf7 {well  neighbor called and alcoholic wife already wasted,  not going out.. ergo, I won't be around them keeping the kids,  a glass of white wine and some fish should help me out... {Later}  ok,  so I've looked at this, it is basically a rook and a bishop against a queen...  I don't like it at all..it doesn't matter what I do here.  I will stall the game for at least 30 moves....} 24. Nc8+ {a double check means he has to move the king right?  that's 1 more move he cant win on...  1 move down.  6 more to go....} Kb8 {So the king wants to jump my horse...  Perverted King !!} 25. Nd6 {Horse wants to ride the queen...and not be ridden by perverted King} Qd5 {Queen considers mounting the horsey.....} 26. Bf3 {Bishop,  wants to poke at the Queen...  These relationship type games are miserable.  Especially when losing....  wonder if I watch "The Note" with the wife if that could be worse.....  a glass of wine is in order....} e4 {well this move comes as a big surprise..lets see now...Bxe4 ...Qd1+  Kxd1 and it's game on !!!!} 27. Bxe4 {well,  lets see,  I feel a mistake coming on  for him,,,  hopefully it involves a Queen donation...} Qe5 {yeah,  I am about tired of this...  I am going down a piece,  and that little wh0re in the middle has been strutting her stuff the whole game...about the best I can see is stringing this out to maybe 35 moves now,  two rooks can beat a rook and a queen right?} 28. O-O {this is all I've got...  if.. Qd4+ I have a chance....} Bxd6 {hmm,,  it appears he likes my knight and bishop for a bishop trade...  weird...} 29. Bxd6+ {I really have no choice here...wait...  I have a tactic that worked once....} Qxd6 {I offer a draw....  it almost worked ,  here are our ensuing comments on the board...  easy19:  ....  Aldo i almost pushed the yes button by mistake. You: LOL, I am laughing my butt off, I didn't expect you to accept, just trying to add humor  to this futile game. easy19:  I alreadh have hick-ups from the laughing :-)} 30. Bxc6 {I take the knight,  still hoping for the odd mistake,  ummm Qxc6 maybe?} bxc6 {well  No Queen gift ...  yet....  } 31. Kh1 {I think he understands by now I want a queen gift,  possibly because he is reading my annotations...  I tuck my king away and set a new goal of 40 moves....  very aggressive for me..  I decide to go to church with wife,,,  maybe I will have some inspiration  to ...  well  last to 42 moves...} Re8 {ok,  I don't understand that move,  I figured he would just line up to pick off my pieces,  now I am thinking he wants to torment me more than 40 moves...} 32. Rcd1 {I apply pressure,  surely he will resign now....} Qe5 {hmm  no resignation...  } 33. h3 {I decide to give my king a new place to hide if needed...  42 moves  a worthy goal...} Qg3 {now just teasing me...  wants me to push f5 I am sure,  of course  I theraten with....} 34. Rf3 {Rf3  of course he only has several alternatives here.} Re1+ {gee,  he wants to take my pieces...} 35. Rxe1 {no choice...} Qxe1+ {again...  more harrassment} 36. Kh2 {no choice again..  but made it to 37,  move 42 is not out of reach..} Qe5+ {more harrassment,,,  but helping on my overall objective..} 37. Kh1 {i didn't want to mess up my pawn structure,  this is really important right now right?  I did the 'coin toss method' on deciding where to move the king...} Qf6 {I don't know why he felt he had to hide her there,  Hiding beside my rook at e3 would have been much better !} 38. Rf2 {just protecting the pawn (b2).} Kc7 {I reckon the queen isn't enough,  he wants to have the everyone after me.} 39. Kg1 {sure,  I'll go out for a handshake...  maybe i can get a dance with the bitch in the middle of the dance floor...a place she has resided frequently this game...} h5 {a pawn attack,  obviously...} 40. b3 {I decide that if my friend's lady wants my pieces,  it will at least cost one more move... maybe he will forget my rook is guarding f5 and Qxf5...  I could still win !} h4 {he is killing me,  I have no moves  nothing,,,  takes me forever to even see a move that doesn't have drastic implications...  I am moving slower now,  hope he doesn't get pissed...} 41. Rf1 {I go here,,  just to keep the pawn a little longer...} Kd6 {The King as an offensive weapon,  I read about that somewhere.....} 42. Rf2 {I have made it 42 moves,,,  what a joy,  I have lost in this tournament with each black and white,  I think I am a 1500 player in real life,  maybe 1150 to 1750 with a good bottle, depends on if i I pouring points out of the bottle into me or onto the board I guess} c5 43. Rf1 {another exciting move....what day is it???} Qd4+ {WOW  she came out of hiding !  but,,  not in a place I could hit her....(I would never hit a lady,  but she is no lady !)} 44. Rf2 {I block !!  wow  I am now 5% over my extended goal of 42 moves...} Ke7 {and His King RETREATS !!!!! (actually I really do believe this is in some way a defensive move!)} 45. Kf1 {I decide I can't handle this any longer ~ my head hurts,  if he wants to play on, he can trade his sweet lady (NOT!) for my castle....  hmm  It seems I traded a house for a lady once before....  familiar...} Qd1# {he declines to make me suffer, dang,  jsut when I thought I had a chance......}
