1. e4 {Annotating this one from black's perspective, hopefully helping the lower-rated folks on the team like me. Black plays solidly through the opening, then a few mistakes around move 12 prove costly and give white a pretty dominant time of it.} c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. f3 exf3 5. Nxf3 Nf6 6. Bc4 Bf5 7. O-O e6 8. Bg5 Nbd7 9. Qd2 Be7 10. Rae1 b5 11. Bb3 Qb6 12. Nh4 O-O-O {The computer analysis prefers moving Bg6. 13. Rxf5 is listed as white's only mistake, with Nxf5 being preferable, but despite the mistake, this series of moves is pretty devastating for black. } 13. Rxf5 exf5 {Ok, this one is listed as a mistake and the suggested optimal is h6, presumably because it preserves the DSB that is left hanging here. The line from h6 shows:   14.	Bxf6	Bxf6 15.	Rxf6	gxf6 16.	Ne4	Ne5 17.	c3	c5 18.	Nxf6	cxd4 19.	Kh1	Qc5 20.	Qf4  This line minimizes the damage, but it also assumes white makes the optimal moves, which seems like a safe assumption given the performance so far.} 14. Rxe7 h6 15. Bxf6 Nxf6 16. Nxf5 c5 17. Bxf7 cxd4 18. Be6+ Kb8 19. Qf4+ Ka8 20. Qf3+ Kb8 21. Nd5 {White is attacking with 5 pieces and forcing black into losing decisions at this point. } Nxd5 22. Bxd5 d3+ 23. Kf1 dxc2 {Even though it looks like a bitter pill, Rxd5 is the better move here as you will shortly see how irritating the LSB is here.} 24. Qf4+ Kc8 25. Be6+ {This is why the trade was better earlier. Now Ed gets nothing in return and white can't be stopped.} Rd7 26. Bxd7+ Kd8 27. Rxg7 Qc7 28. Qh4# {}
