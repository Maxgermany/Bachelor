[Opening "Blackmar gambit (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 {The QP opening and the Classical reply.} 2. e4 {An unusual variant, designed to open the game.} dxe4 {The natural response.} 3. Nc3 {Developing and attacking the advanced Pawn.} Nf6 {Countering with a developing move that defends the Pawn.} 4. f3 {Adding a second attacker.} exf3 {Unable to maintain the Pawn, Stock exchanges.} 5. Nxf3 {The recapture puts Diemer's KN on its natural square.} c6 {Presumably, to prevent a move of P-Q5 by Diemer.} 6. Bc4 {Down a pawn, Diemer plays aggressively. He has 3 pieces developed to just 1 for Stock.} Nbd7 {With QB3 occupied by a Pawn, Stock must play his QN to Q2 instead. His position is beginning to get cramped.} 7. Ng5 {Diemer pressures the natural weakness, the KB2 square.} Nd5 {Blocking the diagonal of the Bishop.} 8. Nxd5 {Capturing the blockader.} cxd5 {Forced.} 9. Nxf7 {Stock resigns. If 9...KxN, 10 BxP ch would force his King into the open. 10 O-O ch or 10 Q-R5 ch or 10 Q-B3 ch would also be good options for Diemer.}
