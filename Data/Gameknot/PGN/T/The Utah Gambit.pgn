1. e4 {A mini-tournament game, I'm playing white and begin with 1. e4 looking for a Ruy Lopez, if black will oblige.} e6 2. d4 {Or the French.} d5 3. c3 {I am naming this the Utah Gambit (so many openings are named after the home town or country of the person who popularized the move, so since this one is all mine, I'm choosing to name it after the state in which I live). I don't know. Don't ask why. I think I was sleepy. I was brushing up on the French, reading about how white plays c3 in response to c5 from black. After I was done reading about the French, I came back and led off with 3. c3 for no good reason other than I guess it was stuck in my head. So, since it's not in the ECO, and I can't find any reference to it, I guess it's mine now, hence the Utah Gambit variation of the French Defense. At least I know I won't be leaning on the GK DB for this opening now... :)} dxe4 4. Nd2 {Black accepted my clever gambit. I shall make him pay for overextending his pawn structure!} Nf6 5. Qc2 {Mwu ha ha ha!} Qd5 6. f3 {Oh well.} exf3 7. Ngxf3 {At least white has a lead in developtment, and unrestricted piece movement (once that knight gets off of d2). And a nice half-open f-file for a rook. I'm starting to like the Utah Gambit.} c5 8. Bc4 {Developing with tempo.} Qd8 9. Ne4 {Black retreated all the way to d8. Safe, but un-developing. White leads the development race 4 to 1, so he can spare the tempo to uncork the DSB.} Be7 10. Nxc5 {Black could have saved the c5 pawn by simply capturing on d4, maintining his pawn lead. Evidently, he felt getting his king off of the half-open central files was a higher priority.} O-O 11. Ne4 Nxe4 12. Qxe4 {If black moves the bishop from c8, he loses the b7 pawn. If he moves the knight from b8 to d7, then Ba6 looks interesting for white. And lets not forget white is looking at h7 too.} f5 13. Qe2 {Black chases the white queen, but at the cost of a backward, pinned, and en prise pawn on e6.} a6 14. O-O {Black didn't defend on e6, but it was unsafe to capture it anyway. After 14. Bxe6 Bxe6 15. Qxe6, black can respond with 15. ... Bh5+ and 16. ... Re8 skewering the white queen to her king. Castling solves this problem.} Qd6 15. Bf4 {Black defends the pawn on e6, so white attacks the defender. The white bishop on f4 is free for the taking, but then the pawn on e6 falls, followed by the bishop on e7, and white ends up a pawn ahead.} Qc6 16. Rae1 {Maybe white should have considered 16. Rfe1 (I did consider it, actually) but the notion of taking a rook off of the half-open f-file and leaving the rook on a1 out of the action didn't appeal.} b5 17. Bxe6+ {Black attacked the white bishop, but now the time is right to pounce on e6 anyway, so all black accomplished was nudging the bishop to make the capture it would have made anyway.} Bxe6 18. Qxe6+ Qxe6 19. Rxe6 {White is now a pawn ahead, and is attacking the black bishop on e7. Note that white is attacking and has a rook in the enemy's camp and three more pieces well placed to spring into action, and black still has two pieces sitting on their starting squares. No matter how the rest of the game turns out, I say this opening was a win for the Utah Gambit, now 1-0 in OTB opening play.} Bf6 20. Bd6 Rd8 21. Be5 {Let's trade.} Kf7 22. Bxf6 gxf6 23. Rfe1 {Oh, look at that pawn structure. Doubled isolated pawns on a half-open file, and white already has a rook in place on that same file. Ripe for the picking. Or it was, before this move. I give 23. Rfe1?! the dubious notation for abandoning the f-file, but it makes a strong move onto the fully open e-file, doubling rooks and supporting the strong white rook on e6.} Ra7 24. Nh4 Rd5 25. a3 {Just trying to remind black that white is everywhere, not just in the center and kingside.} a5 26. Rb6 Nd7 27. Rc6 Nf8 28. Rf1 {White wanted to play Ree6, but black denies, so back to f1 to get those isolanis.} Ng6 29. Nxf5 {White isn't quite ready to trade rooks yet, so capturing with the knight seems best.} Rxf5 30. Rxf5 {I think 29. ... Rxf5? needs a question mark. Black evidently had a plan of forking the white rooks, but it won't work. Even if it did work, giving up the exchange in order to win the exchange simply means making an even exchange of a black rook+piece for a white rook+piece, and even exchanges of pieces do not favor black when he's down by two pawns.} Ne7 31. Rcxf6+ {The rooks are forked, but since either one can move with check, allowing the other to escape the fork, it's a failed fork. Further, white captures the remaining isolated f-pawn in the process.} Kg7 32. Rf6f7+ {White makes a fork of his own.} Kg6 33. Rf5f6+ {Chasing black's king out of his safety and into the territory patroled by those not-so-distant white pawns.} Kg5 34. h4+ {If black plays 34. ... Kxh4, white forces black to give up his remaining rook with 35. Rg7 which threatens checkmate that can only be prevented by 35. ... Ng6 (or maybe 35. ... Nf5), allowing 36. Rxa7.} Kg4 35. Rg7+ {Time for that knight move, and the accompanying loss of the black rook on a7.} Kh5 36. g4+ Kxh4 37. Kg2 {Black squirms, but there is no way out. Move the knight and lose the rook or checkmate is imminent.} h5 38. Rh6 {And now it's mate in 1. Black resigned rather than giving white the pleasure of making the checkmating move - his final defiant act. Score one for the Utah Gambit.}
