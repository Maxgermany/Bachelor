1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {Here playing white in a blitz game. I was thinking about to play the ruy lopez like most of the time in this position.} Bc5 {? Bad move right at the start. There's no point to lose that pawn, black have no good way to create an attack.} 3. Nxe5 {Taking the pawn, wondering what is his plan. Qh4 would be probably countered by Qf3.} Bxf2+ {? This sac is completely unsound, white can defend against it so easily.} 4. Kxf2 Qh4+ 5. g3 {There was not any good place to move the king. In the long term, my pawn structure would give nice possibilities for black to attack me, but with this move, I was so much ahead in development and black position was so bad that I didn't care a bit. Black must not lose any tempo to gain some advantage of this position, thing that is almost impossible now that the queen is on the middle of the field.} Qxe4 6. Nf3 {Protecting the knight, the rook and the king.} Nf6 7. Nc3 {The beginning of the king hunt.} Ng4+ {His knight is on a good place, but black have only 2 active pieces.} 8. Kg2 Qc6 {?!} 9. Bb5 {Another gain of tempo!} Qb6 10. Re1+ {His king gonna be in a bad position too.} Kf8 11. d4 {Blocking Qf2 and giving an exit for my bishop.} a6 12. Nd5 {! Black must now move very accurately.} Qa5 {? Qd6 was probably the only right move.} 13. Re8+ {!!} Kxe8 14. Qe2+ {Mate is coming!} Kf8 15. Qe7+ {Kg8 then Qe8#}
