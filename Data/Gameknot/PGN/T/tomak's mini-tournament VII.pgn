1. e4 {I think i went wrong in the opening in this game and my opponent developed a very strong position and had a positional bind which i was fortunate enough to overcome and managed to win this game which was very important in the tournament we are both in as with his score of 100% i considered him a serious rival for 1st place so knew i was going to have to fight hard. The game was certainly very interesting and though a draw should have been a fair result we were both clearly playing for the win.} c5 {Currently my choice against e4 but i am itching to play d5 again.} 2. Nc3 {Indicating that perhaps the grand prix attack is on the cards with a quick f4.} g6 {My standard response as the accelarated dragon is not too concerned about it.} 3. Bc4 {Standard stuff} Nc6 {Bg7 is probably better followed by e6 and the Knight finds a home on e7. The Knight move is a bit premature here and leads to a problem for me as you will see.} 4. Nf3 {Giving up the opportunity of the grand prix attack but still a good move as he has developed 3 pieces and is ready to castle whereas i have developed one and i am no where near ready to castle.} Bg7 {Sensing the problem but a move too late.} 5. O-O {Because the pawn is not on c3 i could play Nf6 but e5 is a problem to meet. Ng4 is met by Bxf7 winning a pawn so i never feel safe with a Knight on f6 so.....} e6 {So i can slot my knight on e7 but the problem is that he is all developed and ready to go and i need 2 more moves that i have not got.} 6. d4 {Excellent move. It sacrifices a pawn but puts the question to me "What are you going to do??" I had completely missed this very strong idea.} cxd4 {Of Course it has to be taken. } 7. Nb5 {Thats the point he can recover the pawn at will but is threatening Nd6+ which may be very strong and at the same time Bf4 is not out of the question increasing the pressure. If i play d6 then he could play Bg5 or take the pawn on d4 and i have a weakness and i am still no closer to castling and his attacking potential increases and i am going to be in trouble very quickly. } Nge7 {I decided to live with the check and hope hye will grab the pawn as i want to retain the possibility of playing d7-d5 in one go and the flexibility of my pawn chain.} 8. Nd6+ {Understandable and this knight is going to be a problem for a few moves.} Kf8 {The easiest choice of the game since it is forced.} 9. Bf4 {Got to be a reasonable continuation for white. He now just needs to get the files open and his rooks active whilst my pieces are in disarray.} Qb6 {Since i have allowed the check i have to keep hold of the material to justify my existence as if he ever regains the pawn i am simply lost.} 10. Qd3 {Connecting the rooks got to be good.} e5 {Treading a tightrope with this move. My only developed bishop is now rubbish but i must keep the material and try to sure up the position to survive and i figured if i can get f6 in as well his attacking chances will be stopped for a while.} 11. Bg3 {Natural} Nb4 {Putting the question to the queen and attacking the Knight on d6 and finally leaving room for my other Knight to move to} 12. Nxc8 {Pretty much forced and i was glad to see exchanges.} Nxc8 {I can get away with this since his queen is attacked.} 13. Qb3 {Keeping the pressure} f6 {I had to judge that Nxe5 does not work here as i can move to f6 with my queen covering the check if he followed up with Qf3+. I had both fingers crossed in case i missed something though.} 14. c3 {Trying to pry open the lines} Nc6 {Pretty much forced. dxc is out of the question while the queens are on.} 15. Qxb6 {I did not expect him to take me here. He has all the play and should have retreated. By taking all his attacking chances for a knock out checkmate have evaporated. He still has a very good chance of the win but i can't believe that taking the Queen was correct.} Nxb6 {Naturally i do not want to double my pawns.} 16. Nd2 {This i believe was also a serious error because of what happened. I think Bb3 was fine and in keeping with his plans but this led to complications that slightly favour me.} dxc3 {Now because the queens are off i can grab it.} 17. bxc3 {Natural capture} Bh6 {Now the problem of Nd2 is revealed. My useless bishop has been brought back from the dead and my King may find refuge on g7 connecting my rooks.} 18. f4 {Forced} exf4 {I was starting to like my chances here. My position is by no means safe but it is starting to look like a position that has potential unlike 9 moves ago when i was waiting for the fireworks and expecting to get crushed in short order for my greed.} 19. Bxf4 {natural} Bxf4 {Normally in Dragons you shrive to keep the dark squared bishop but here every tempo counts and exchanges are helping me free my position so i exchange it off to give me time to make my king safe.} 20. Rxf4 {Kg7 was my first thought but then i am willingly going into an endgame where he has a bishop against my knights so thought take the Bishop.} Nxc4 {So i did as he can't take on f6 really as after Kg7 both pieces are attacked and Rxc6 is met by dxR and my pawn structure is better and i am the exchange up.} 21. Nxc4 {This is best i feel for White} Kg7 {Hurrah. Now whilst this might not be a picture perfect scene i am sure that many of you never thought black could survive including me and now if i keep my head i am a pawn up and have winning chances for the first time in the game.} 22. Raf1 {Natural} Rhf8 {Happily i move to f8 and my confidence grows.} 23. Nd6 {This Knight move is very good. I did not realise how annoying it was going to be. The piece is a monster and controls a lot of key squares. My joy last turn was replaced with a gasp as i struggled to find a plan against it.} b6 {obviously i have to keep the pawn but how am i planning on getting out of this mess.} 24. Rg4 {White too clearly has problems and can't see a clear plan as looking for cheap checks is not going to win you the game. I think after 23.Nd6 this game is drawn but i was happy to see this.} Ne5 {Activating my knight} 25. Rg3 {Naturally he moves it} h5 {Since i have nothing to do with my rooks as they have no where to go and my Knight is happy where he is i figured try to pawn storm him to gain space.} 26. Nf5+ {This was the other reason since i knew that this was coming but it is really pointless as it does not do anything} Kh7 {My king is safe on h7.} 27. Ne7 {Attacking the g6 pawn which is defended twice. Can someone tell me the benefit but i was happy to see it.} Rf7 {Getting ready to double my rooks and play f5 if allowed} 28. Nd5 {As expected} Raf8 {Happily defending and now i might be threatening to play f5} 29. Nc7 {After this i was not convinced. Exchanging his weakness on e4 for my pawn on f6 did not appeal as if you take all the pieces off bar the kings my pawn structure is much better.} h4 {I want to know what he plans to do and want to solidify my structure with my other pawn on g5. } 30. Rh3 {Natural} g5 {Defending and planning to meet g3 with Knight g6 and g4} 31. Re3 {Avoiding my plan} Kg6 {Giving my pawn structure extra defense} 32. Re2 {Re2 shows me that he is struggling to find a plan.} Nd3 {My knight wants to touch base with the e4 pawn and defend d7} 33. Rd1 {Trying to double on the d file} Nc5 {Now he can't yet.} 34. Nb5 {Good move. But i feel he should have played this earlier.} Re7 {this was a mistake. a6 is playable though i convinced myself that it was not and he should have gone for the drawing line.} 35. Nd6 {He did not take it and i had worked out that he takes on a7 and i take on e4 and the position is very finely balance but drawn. He wanted more and so played this move which again constricts my army totally.} Re5 {Aggressive play with my rook but what else is there for black.} 36. Kf2 {its a move but not sure what it is achieving} Na4 {I am now starting to attack him for a change} 37. Re3 {natural} Rc5 {here we go} 38. c4 {Great move. Now my attack has come to a halt and Ra3 may be threatened so what can black do??} a6 {Common theme IGNORE THE THREAT my plan is to give back the pawn with the break b5 to activate my other rook.} 39. Ra3 {in keeping with his plan} b5 {In keeping with mine} 40. Rb1 {Here i deviated. I do not believe that Rook b1 was best for him. I thought cxb followed by Rb1 was best.} Rc6 {Now i get to get rid of that annoying Knight.} 41. cxb5 {Natural} Rxd6 {It felt good to take that beast.} 42. Rxa4 {Natural} axb5 {Keeping the pawn up.} 43. Rab4 {I was at first surprised that he did not take the pawn but then i saw why. If he does after rd2+ he has problems as after the Natural Kf1 Rc8 threatens mate and my rooks are going to be all over his second rank.} Rd2+ {Got to be played.} 44. Kf3 {I thought Kf1 was best.} Ra8 {Threatening to take the pawn with tempo.} 45. Rb1b2 {He wants to get the rooks off so he can survive.} Ra3+ {First time to give another check. } 46. Kg4 {This is definately wrong. His best chance was Rook b4-b3 stopping the check but i understand why he did not as after i take with check i pick up the a2 pawn and have a great chance of converting with him having little counterplay.} Rxb2 {This seems very strong now} 47. Rxb2 {Natural} d5 {Kapow. The pawn can't be taken it is very much poisoned.} 48. exd5 {But he takes it.  } f5# {So the killer blow comes. A very exciting battle and i can't wait for the rematch in the 2nd game of the tournament we play!!!}
