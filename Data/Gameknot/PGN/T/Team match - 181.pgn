[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 e6 2. e4 e5 {Queen's pawn opening.  This move is very unusual--d5 is the overwhelmingly most popular response.} 3. d5 {Not in the database.  But it is how I would have responded as white.} Bc5 4. Nc3 Bb4 {Black has moved two pieces two times.} 5. Bd2 Qf6 6. Qf3 d6 7. O-O-O Nh6 8. Bxh6 Qxf3 {QxBh6+ would also have been interesting.} 9. Nxf3 gxh6 10. Nb5 Na6 11. c3 Bc5 12. b4 {Pf2 is undefended.} Bxf2 13. Kb2 Bd7 14. Na3 O-O-O 15. Bxa6 bxa6 16. Rhf1 Be3 17. Nh4 Bf4 18. g3 Bg5 19. Ng2 Bh3 20. Rf2 Bxg2 21. Rxg2 Rdf8 22. Nc4 Kd7 23. h4 Bf6 24. Rf2 Bg7 25. Na5 f6 26. Nc6 Rfa8 27. Kb3 a5 {Seems like black is tossing his pawn advantage.  But those doubled pawns are not worth a whole lot.} 28. Nxa5 Rab8 29. Nc6 Rb6 30. Nxa7 {While anything but obvious now, white will come to regret snatching that pawn.} Ra8 31. Nc6 Rba6 32. c4 {This was probably a blunder.  The white king can get pushed back, and white risks losing Rf2 as a consequence.} Ra6a3+ 33. Kc2 Ra3xa2+ 34. Kd3 {A definite blunder.  Black brilliantly goes for the white king's throat instead of snatching the free rook.} Ra8a3# {}
