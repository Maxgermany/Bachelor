1. d4 {Should Have Drawn?  I hate d4. People should have the decency to play e4. I know how to play e4. Well... to a certain extent.} d5 2. c4 {Oh THAT old chestnut. Shall I resign now. Very tempted.} dxc4 3. e3 e6 4. a3 Nf6 {When in doubt dominate the middle. I'm not good with opening theory and I've never felt comfortable playing this opening so I'm just piling out and hoping for the best.} 5. Bxc4 Nc6 6. Nc3 Na5 {Add one pinch of sheer optimism.} 7. Bb5+ Bd7 {Not going to move c6 as I want that space when the knight runs away.} 8. Bxd7+ Qxd7 9. b4 Nc4 {When the knight runs away I said! You see I plan things, then a few moves go by and I completely forget.... Not sure what I was doing here....} 10. Qf3 c6 11. Nge2 Be7 12. O-O Bd8 {Vague ambitions to the h2 pawn, with B-c7 and Q-d6. Quite speculative and I'd probably have been better off playing for the moment...} 13. e4 Bc7 14. e5 Ng8 {d5 might have been better....} 15. Qd3 Nxe5 {Thats surprisingly adventuruous for me!} 16. Qg3 Ng6 {Ah yes, protect the g pawn...} 17. Bf4 Bxf4 18. Nxf4 Qxd4 {Two pawns up! Now, develop!!!} 19. Nce2 Qf6 20. Rfd1 Ng8e7 21. Nxg6 Nxg6 22. Qc7 O-O {Ok I can sac a pawn right.... wrong. Turns out pretty crucial :-(} 23. Qxb7 Ne7 24. Qd7 h6 25. Qd3 Nd5 26. Rac1 Rac8 27. Ng3 Rfd8 28. Nh5 {Now this knight of his turns into a pigging nuisance. I'm trying to get an exposed attack on his queen, but he isn't having it. What a meanie eh?} Qg5 29. Ng3 Nf4 30. Qe3 Rxd1+ 31. Rxd1 Nd5 32. Qxa7 {Ah phooey, there goes the two pawn advantage.} Rc7 33. Qd4 e5 34. Qd3 h5 35. Ne4 Qf4 36. g3 Qg4 37. f3 Qe6 38. Ng5 Qg6 39. f4 Qxd3 40. Rxd3 f6 {That looks like an error now. pxp would have been better, wonder why I didn't play that...} 41. Ne6 Re7 42. Nd8 e4 43. Rd1 Rc7 44. Rc1 e3 45. Kf1 Ne7 46. Ne6 Rc8 47. a4 Nd5 48. b5 {Now those a and b pawns start to worry me.....} Nb4 49. b6 Re8 50. Nd4 Kf7 51. a5 Ra8 52. Nxc6 Nxc6 53. b7 Rxa5 54. Rxc6 Rb5 55. Rc7+ Kg6 56. Ke2 Rb3 57. h3 Kh6 58. g4 hxg4 59. hxg4 g6 60. Re7 g5 {BAADDDDD move, allows him to trap my king meaning I can only move the rook. Do I carry on protecting e3 or b8...... can't do both.} 61. f5 Rb1 62. Kxe3 Re1+ 63. Kf3 Rxe7 {I'll settle for rook vs queen and hope shall I....} 64. b8=Q Kg7 65. Qh2 Rd7 66. Qh5 Rd6 67. Qg6+ Kf8 68. Qh7 Ke8 69. Qg8+ Ke7 70. Qc8 Rd3+ 71. Kf2 Rd2+ 72. Ke3 Rd6 73. Qb7+ Ke8 74. Qc7 Rd7 75. Qc8+ Ke7 76. Qg8 Rd6 77. Qg7+ Ke8 78. Ke4 Kd8 79. Qf8+ Kd7 80. Qf7+ Kd8 81. Qa7 Ke8 82. Qc7 Rd7 {That was one mistake too many.} 83. Qc6 {King to e7 draws Q-e6 and the pawn goes...followed by the other pawn, ah well. I still think I should have been able to get a draw out of it if I'd been good enough.}
