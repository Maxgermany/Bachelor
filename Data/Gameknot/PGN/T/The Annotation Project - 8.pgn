1. e4 {This is my other win with Black, so far in the Project.  As usual, the action begins at move 7.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 {Unlike in the game against yoshark, I play the same move people have played against me.} 9. Bxg4 Qd5 {but adopt my own response to the threats of Nf7 and Ne6+.  This looks far more active than 9...Qe8 or a king move that we've seen in other games} 10. Nc3 {White develops with tempo} Qc6 11. O-O {and castles: his development is still far superior to Black's} Nd7 {aiming for f6 and releasing the QR for action.  11.... Na6 was an interesting alternative that I don't think I considered at the time but has been played against me in a few games since (in different positions - but I'm thinking about moves that are typically good in this variation).} 12. Ncxe4 {Another thematic move that I've played as White in several of these games.  White removes the annoying e4 pawn, preparing to complete his development by moving the d-pawn and developing the QB and QR.  Black's development is still lagging.} e5 {to free the B} 13. Nf7 {to take the inactive rook on h8 but at what cost?} Qxe4 14. Nxh8 Nf6 {Counter-attack!  The N on h8 can wait while I harass the B on g4.} 15. Be6 {Naturally White defends the N's escape square.} Be7 16. Nf7 exf4 {discovering a backwards attack on the Be6} 17. Ng5 {once more, counter-attacking} Qe5 {and responding in kind.  Both minor pieces are attacked by the Q} 18. d4 {distraction} Qxd4+ 19. Kh1 Nh5 {I didn't want White to take on f4 with check.  The White QB is still confined to base, condemning White's extra rook to a similar enforced idleness.} 20. Nh3 Rf8 {completing my development and reinforcing f4} 21. Bg4 Nf6 {Attacked by White's B, the N retreats to f6, returning the compliment, but f4 is once again vulnerable.} 22. Bxf4+ Kb6 23. Rad1 {Finally White completes his development.  According to conventional scoring, he is one point ahead and his K is apparently safer than Black's} Qa4 {NOT 23...Qxb2, when her majesty would be pinned against her sire by 24. Rb1.  With this move, c2 is attacked and the Bf4 remains pinned against the Bg4.  The Q is also safe agaisnt double attacks.} 24. Be6 {releasing the aforementioned pin and defending the a2 pawn.} Qxc2 25. Rdc1 Qe4 {Recentralisation!  Once more attacking the Be6.} 26. Rfe1 {Defending and attacking simultaneously} Qg6 {Bowing to the attack but maintaining pressure on White's kingside... and, completely unexpectedly, White resigned.  Explanations?  I suspect that White just realised that his hopes of a quick win were over but, given that he's +2 up and still has the devastating pair of Bishops and open lines for his rooks, I'd say he's still winning.  Perhaps the psychological effect of being without a Q is too much?}
