Nxf6 {And I take black's f pawn.} d4 39. h4 {h4!? It's an easy # threaten, but the !? is because I decide to lose a tempo giving the chance to promote to black.

Rh7# {Rh7#! Nice game cause me and my opponent have done bad mistakes, but this ending.......I couldn't believe it! Anyway, what do you think about this game?}
