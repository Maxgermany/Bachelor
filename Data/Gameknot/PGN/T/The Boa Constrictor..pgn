1. e4 {A team game annotated for instructional purposes and improvement.} c6 2. d4 {Caro-Kann Defense} d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nf6 8. Ne5 {Up to this point the classical line found in most opening data banks.} Bh7 {Not willing to give up the bishop and stack the pawns.} 9. Bd3 {Confronting the Bishop.} Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bf4 {All perfectly fine moves by both so far.} Qa5+ 12. Bd2 {Also good was c3, leaving the bishop on a strong diagonal.} Qd5 {Striking at the g pawn.} 13. O-O {Defending the pawn. Other options were, Nf3, f3 and Qb3. The last offering to exchange pawns and not fearing QxQ due to axb3 next which opens the file for the rook.} Nbd7 {Doubling on the knight at e5.} 14. Rfe1 {Guarding the knight. Also available was Nf3,Bf4 or f4.} Be7 {Developing the bishop to a better square and allowing short side castling.} 15. c4 {Trying to displace the queen.} Nxe5 {...but black can counter which opens up the file for the lady to back up.} 16. Rxe5 {Now making the queen move.} Qd7 {The best place for her.} 17. Rae1 {Creating a rook battery on the open e file.} O-O-O {Castling and double attacking the d pawn.} 18. c5 {Whites first mistake. He fails to defend from the threat and gives up a valuable center pawn, thus opening a file for black. Called for was Bc3.} Qxd4 19. Qxd4 Rxd4 20. Be3 Ra4 {Only makes white play a3.} 21. a3 Rd8 {Seizing the file back before white takes  it.} 22. Ne2 {Leaving h4 hanging still.} Ng4 {Leaving the h pawn for now and attacking the advanced rook plus threatening NxB and making a isolated pawn for white if the rook moves off the file.} 23. Nc3 {Countering which is usually good especially if there is no proper place for the white e5 rook to go.} Nxe5 24. Nxa4 Bxh4 {Now picking up the lonely pawn. This make black up by two pawns.} 25. Nc3 Nd3 {Attacking the rook and b2. } 26. Re2 f5 27. g3 Bf6 {The threat is BxN and bxc3 making double isolated pawns.} 28. Na4 {Stopping the exchange.} e5 29. Nc3 {Going back seeing that black blocked himself from the previous threat. However black can simply play e4 (which he does) and you have wasted valuable time shuffling the knight. What was called for was f3 to stop or contend with the e4 push.} e4 30. Rd2 g5 {Advancing to squeeze the kings position.} 31. f4 {Not too much else to do. But this gives up a pawn by en passant. Better to have not moved the pawn.} exf3 e.p. 32. Nd1 h5 33. b4 {Nf2 brings a defender closer and blocks the f3 pawn. White saw Nxb2 and was trying to remove the pawn to safety. Nf2 does keep the pawn safe as there is no longer a RxN at d1 possibility after the exchange on b2.} f4 {Squeezing tighter.} 34. gxf4 g4 {Keeping the pawns connected which is stronger than two isolated files of pawns.} 35. Nf2 {Now he sees Nf2.} Nxf2 {Exchanging down to a won endgame.} 36. Rxd8+ Kxd8 37. Bxf2 h4 {Squeezing again.} 38. Be3 g3 {Tighter still!} 39. f5 h3 40. Bf4 Bd4+ {White survived the late middle game only to loose due to the two pawns he gave up much earlier.}
