[Opening "Reti (A06), Nimzovich-Larsen attack"]

1. Nf3 {The Reti opening} d5 2. b3 {Nimzowitsch originally came up with the idea of 1.Nf3 d5 2.b3 and 3.Bb2 to put pressure on e5,but Reti's idea of 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 putting pressure on d5 is better.} e6 {A rare move.I was basically going to play this as a Queen's gambit declined which is one of my favorite openings as Black.} 3. Bb2 Nf6 4. e3 c5 {The center is ripe and for the taking.} 5. Bb5+ Bd7 6. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 {Black has a comfortable position.} 7. O-O Bd6 8. c4 O-O 9. d3 Qc7 {Putting pressure on the b8-h2 diagonal.} 10. Nc3 Rfd8 {Putting my rooks in the center.} 11. cxd5 exd5 {Now Black has the "hanging pawns" in the center} 12. Nb5 Qb6 13. a4 a6 {Kicking the knight back.} 14. Nc3 c4 {! A good move if I do say so myself.} 15. dxc4 dxc4 16. Ba3 {16.bxc4? Qxb2 17.Qxd6 Qxc3 wins.} Bxa3 17. Rxa3 Qb4 {Black at least wins a pawn.I pretty much calculated this ahead of time.} 18. Nb1 Nc5 {A discovered attack on the queen that wins the b-pawn for good.} 19. Qe2 cxb3 20. Qb2 Rac8 21. Nfd2 Rd3 {A flexible move.protecting the b-pawn and preparing to double my rooks on the d-file.} 22. Rc1 Rcd8 {Black's position is dominating.} 23. Rc4 Qa5 24. h3 {Creating luft for the king.Although this loses another pawn} Rd3xd2 {I don't think White considered this move.} 25. Nxd2 Rxd2 {Now black has a beautiful placed Rook on the 2nd rank.} 26. Qe5 b2 {Passed pawns must be pushed! } 27. Rb3 Rd1+ {Black is one step away from queening.} 28. Kh2 Qd8 {28...b1=Q? loses to 29.Rxb1! taking advantage of Black's weak back rank after 29...Rxb1?? 30.Qb8+ Qd8 31. Qxd8+ Ne8 32.Qxe8#.That would be a tragic way to end a good game played by Black.} 29. Rxb2 Nd3 {Black's knight on d3 forks White's Queen on e5 and rook on b2.The rest is pretty straightfoward.} 30. Qc7 Nxb2 31. Rc2 Qxc7+ 32. Rxc7 g6 {Black gets rid of any Back rank mate possibilities } 33. Rxb7 Nxa4 34. Rb8+ Kg7 35. Ra8 Nc5 36. Rc8 Nfd7 37. Rc7 Rd6 38. Ra7 Kf6 39. f3 Nb3 40. Rb7 Ndc5 {Notice how the knights become an escort for Black's passed a pawn} 41. Rb4 a5 42. Rf4+ Ke6 43. g4 a4 {The passed pawn can't be stopped.} 44. Rb4 a3 45. Rc4 a2 {White resigns.}
