1. e4 e5 2. f4 {King's gambit offered, and accepted} exf4 3. Nf3 g5 {Black advances g5, which can lead to the "Muzio" opening.  It is a favourite opening of mine, but is rarely offered by opposition.} 4. Bc4 {Bring out the bishop, allowing 0-0 } g4 5. O-O {0-0.  Offering the Knight in exchange for position.} gxf3 {Black accepts the Muzio.  I have played games at this point where black refuses the Muzio, preferring to keep a double pawn advancement.   } 6. Qxf3 {Take some time to observe this position.  Once the D pawn is advanced, the F4 will be won.  This gives 3 pronged power attack on black's isolated F7, and threatens mate.   The object of Muzio (in my mind anyhow) is to keep this constant pressure on black.  Players <1700 will typically make a mistake under this constant pressure.  Most players >1700 will be familiar with the opening, and will defend it better..} Qf6 {QF6 is highly unusual.  More normal is B-c5 , bringing out a major and 'buying' another turn to bring out the next major  (white normal response would be Kh1)} 7. e5 {The object of this is 2 fold to avoid the Bishop coming out... again, losing a piece in exchange for tempo.  And to cave the way for the next move..} Qxe5 8. Bxf7+ {Now this is drawing the King out, forfeiting the castling right.  Obviously white is significantly down on pieces right now.} Kxf7 9. d4 {This move is buying tempo.  Sacrifice a pawn, but it avoids the Bc5  which is bring out a major.  This opens up c1x f4.  So far we still have the R-Q line on F threatening the King.  Black will have to scurry back soon. Obviously, this buying temp can't continue forever.  White is running out of pieces.} Qxd4+ 10. Be3 {White has a major piece disadvantage, but a huge positional advantage.  The challenge for white is to keep constant pressure on the king.  Absolutely constant - like you were doing one of those chess puzzles in the newspaper.  Black obviously hopes to win another piece, then it is over. This position was first seen in Shirov v Lapinski in 1990.} Qg7 {Black had a lot of choices, and tempting would have been Qxb2 apparently winning the rook.  If you play that out, QxF4  will soon result in mate, or Kg7 resulting in white winning the black queen.} 11. Bxf4 {For me it is important to take with the bishop and not with the queen.  This point allows Be5 (  !_) and potentially winning a queen or rook.} Nf6 {Black notices the threat, and covers his King.} 12. Bxc7 {I chose BxP here, because I felt that Be5 would result in Be7 and then the game would be locked.  Also I needed to start winning back a few pieces.} Nc6 {If I were black, I would have played Bc5 , and then Nc6.} 13. Nc3 {In Muzio it is essential to bring out the knight.  this applies whether you play standard Muzio or so called double Muzio.} Bc5+ {Finally!} 14. Kh1 d6 {This is a good move by black.  The bishop is now locked in and threatened.  } 15. Rae1 {I did this in anticipaton of Bg4.  } Bg4 16. Qd5+ {With the knight being pinned, Black doesnt have a lot of choice.  The alternative move of Qf4 wouldnt have kept enough pressure on the king, and he could have then moved Kg8 and hidden away.} Kg6 {There were only 2 moves.  Kf8 or this one.  I was hoping for Kf8, so I could BxP  BxB QxB , and followed down with my rook to the 7th.} 17. Qd3+ {Keeping constant pressure on black.} Kh5 {Black may have been able to encourage a draw if he went Kf7.  Wasnt sure what else to do then to go back to d5 } 18. h3 {This has a mate threat.  QxB brings PxB  and mate soon follows.  } Bd7 {There may have been merit in Rg8 here, allowing white to win back a piece, but having its own threatening line to g2. e.g. Rg8, PxB , Nxg4... and the Muzio would have been reversed !} 19. Bxd6 {I did this mainly because the pawn at d6 was stopping me going to e5 (so does the N at c6, but that's a lesser problem.)} Bxd6 20. Qxd6 {so i win a pawn, and the piece advantage lessens... positional advantage still strong for white.} Rhg8 {I think black is 2 moves too late with this one, but it is definitely a good move.  1 move away from mate, so it needs reacting.} 21. g4+ {This is the best I could come up with.  Black is forced to lose a major here, but in exchange for 2 pawns maybe not a bad deal??  Positionally very dangerous, as white can threaten to h2, and with all those rooks open without pawns blocking their view.} Nxg4 {As black, I would have taken with the bishop.  I'm sure that 2000  players will disagree.} 22. hxg4+ Qxg4 {This I think is a mistake from black.  If he had this position, with the Knight here instead of the Queen... then it stops white with Qh2 .  Also with the bishop, ...assuming he can eeek his King to safety for just 1 move, then Bf3  is followed immediately with Qg2  .  } 23. Re2 {Qh2 would force a queen swap, and with this piece disadvantage white would surely lose (rooks lack freedom of movement due to h1).  It also defends agains Qg2   I had to check very very carefully that this didnt somehow expose the F1 rook to a loss.} Qh4+ {Black anticipates h2  and wants to avoid giving away the queen.  } 24. Rh2 Bh3 {Note the need for constant pressure again from white.  Qe4    !!} 25. Qd5+ Rg5 {Kh6 would have been better as we will see..} 26. Qf3+ {This was to win the blackbishop.  } Bg4 {I'm not sure why black did that..g6 seemed safer (my response would have been Qf7 , Kh6, Rf6 .... maybe ending in a draw) I also see often in Muzio mistakes like this from the oppositon, just due to the mental drainage.  When you defend against this, it is very tiring.} 27. Rxh4+ Kxh4 {finally...small piece advantage, and good position... only took 27 moves!} 28. Qf2+ Kh5 29. Qf7+ Kh6 30. Rf6+ Rg6 {from here I was also a little tired and saw only the easy route.. I have the piece advantage, swap down and grab free pawns where possible. There were probably better ways.} 31. Rxg6+ hxg6 32. Qxb7 {The free pawn.  Now  2 and good threat on another pawn.} Rc8 33. Nb5 Kg5 34. Kg1 {I moved the king here, perhaps unnecessarily.  I was tired, and was worried and Bf3 forking the King and Queen (his king would need to be at f4).  Anyhow, I was tired and had the advantage so why take risks and why spend time thinking hard about such things?} Bf5 35. Nd6 {Here another major piece comes my way and the rest should be formality.  I wanted to keep a pawn in reserve as ending up with K-Q v K-R can be difficult.} Rb8 36. Qxc6 Rxb2 37. Nxf5 {swap down the advantage.} gxf5 38. c4 Rxa2 {I was giving serious thought to Qg2  resulting in Q-R swap, and advancing my pawn... but saw that I didn't have enough time to get there !} 39. c5 a5 40. Qd5 Ra1+ 41. Kf2 Kg4 42. Qd4+ {And its over.   thanks for listening!}
