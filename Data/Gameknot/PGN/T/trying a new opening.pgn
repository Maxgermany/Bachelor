1. Nf3 {same first move} d5 2. g3 {I admit that this isn't the best opening and i don't really know how to use but i got board so decided to try some new openings } Nc6 3. Bg2 d4 4. c3 Nf6 5. cxd4 Nxd4 6. Qa4+ {wasn't expecting that, but i probably should have castled by now} c6 {? should have blocked with the knight} 7. Qxd4 g5 {?! loses ability to castle and loses a pawn} 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. Nxg5 Ke8 {stops the danger of nxe7+ } 10. b3 {not great leads to disaster} e5 11. Nf3 Bg7 {no ? its a pawn for pawn or knight and pawn for rook} 12. Nxe5 Ng4 {good move} 13. Nxg4 {should have moved f4 one point by point system and one of my two largest forces on the board} Bxa1 14. Ne3 {retreating from bishop } h5 {no real purpose i can see} 15. Nc3 h4 16. O-O h3 17. Bf3 Rg8 18. Ba3 Bxc3 {realising that the bishop was useless } 19. dxc3 f5 20. Rd1 {hoping he would continue with the pawn} f4 {he does} 21. Bh5+ {resigned nothing he could do } Rg6 {if he hadn't resigned this was the only move he could do} 22. Bxg6# {and I would have finished him off}
