1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 {If you are thinking Sicilian you would be wrong this game transposes into a French advanced hybrid. } e6 3. c3 d5 4. e5 Nc6 5. d4 {Transposing into an advanced French defence} Nge7 {I want to put as much pressure on d4 as possible. So one plan to do that is to put the king's knight on f5. However, white can usually eliminate it with a timely bishop exchange. } 6. Bd3 cxd4 7. cxd4 Nf5 8. Be3 {White could also play 8.Bxf5 with a good game. However, white is I think trying to retain his bishop pair for as long as possible. } Be7 {Master move alert! Finish developing before kick starting exchanges in the centre. } 9. Nc3 Nxe3 {Even though I have completed half my development this seemed to be the best moment to exchange as moves like ...Bd7 or ...Qb6 did not seem to be as forcible as the text move. I.E it creates a weakness} 10. fxe3 Bd7 {I have a very small positional advantage due to my pieces sitting on their currently most optimal squares. Also white has doubled pawns on the e-file which become problematic later on. } 11. O-O O-O 12. Rc1 {Both sides continue to methodical development of pieces. } Rc8 13. a3 {preventing ...Nb4 or ...Bb5} a6 {I am thinking that white would want to aim for a b4-b5 push so I am preventing it now with this move and the next. } 14. b4 Na7 {white has good pressure on b5 so it is important that I take care of the weakness. Besides clearing the c-file for my rook it does prevent the immediate b4-b5. The trade off is that I have a poor knight. } 15. Qb3 {White is eager to push through with b4-b5} Bg5 {Hitting at white's most important weakness on e3 and distracting from b4-b5} 16. Rfe1 {If 16.Nxg5 Qxg4 solves nothing for white. } Bh6 {This retains the bishop and keeps the white rook pinned to the defense of e3. } 17. Kh1 {dodging any business on e3. } g6 {limits the LSB on d3 and creates a potential strong point for attack on f5.  } 18. Qb1 Rc6 {The rook takes the lead on attacking white's other weakness on c3. } 19. Qb2 Qc7 {White so far has managed to maintain the balance in the position but things are about to change quickly. My goal is to slowly improve my piece development without creating further weakness in my position. While at the same time hoping for white to overextend himself somehow. } 20. Nd2 {heading to the defence of c3 via b1} Rc8 {forcing Nb1 to saddle white with a poor knight. } 21. Ndb1 Be8 {anticipate an attack on f7 and clears the desk for the queen to assist on the f-file. } 22. Qf2 Qd8 {defending the hole on f6. It is important to know where your weaknesses are take care of them. } 23. Rc2 {!? this allows me to neutralize some of white's pressure on the queen side while getting rid of my useless knight. } Nb5 24. Bxb5 axb5 {A bad knight for a better bishop at the cost of a semi weak pawn } 25. Kg1 {The game down a lot at this point. It was here that my opponent offered a draw. However, I decline because I hope to slowly outplay my opponent. } Qg5 26. Rcc1 Bd7 {x-raying f5. I hope to exchange queens on f5 to clear the 3rd rank for my rook on c3. Giving it greater scope. } 27. Kh1 Qf5 28. Qd2 {white avoids the exchange. } f6 {I decide to go for it. After all someone has to, even if it ends in a draw. Though I see to potential for a possible ...e5 } 29. exf6 Qxf6 30. Ref1 {seizing control of the F-file. } Qg5 {Double attack on e3. } 31. Rce1 {defending e3. } Rc6c4 {Threatening ...e5. } 32. Re2 Kh8 {White is all most completely pinned down to the defense of e3. He almost can not afford to move anything!} 33. Qd3 {Here my opponent resigns on account of following possible variations.  } Qh5 {The other main possibility was ...e5} 34. e4 {The only move really that gives white a chance to draw} Rc4xc3 35. Nxc3 Rxc3 36. Qxc3 Qxe2 {Black has more than enough compensation for the pawn. My Bishop pair along with the queen will easily outplay white's queen and rook. } 37. Rg1 {strongest move. } Qf2 {pinning the rook to the back rank} 38. Qc7 {attacking the bishop and pawn } Qf7 39. exd5 exd5 {the semi vacant center is far more useful to the bishop pair. } 40. Re1 Bg5 41. Qxb7 Qf2 42. Ra1 Qf5 43. Rd1 {White has to keep his rook on the back rank so there is no threat of mate for white. However, the black bishops will start a witch hunt on the queen. } Kg7 44. Qc7 Bf4 45. Qd8 Qe6 46. Qh4 g5 47. Qf2 {White queen is running out of good space. } Qg4 48. Re1 Bf5 {The centre is completely owned by black. } 49. Qf3 {The queen exchange lessens the threat of mate for the time being. } Qxf3 50. gxf3 Kf6 {The center is all mine along with the game. } 51. Re8 Bd3 52. Kg2 Bc4 53. Rf8+ Kg7 54. Re8 Bc1 {A hunting we will go. } 55. Ra8 Be3 56. Kg3 Kg6 57. Ra6+ Kf5 58. a4 bxa4 59. Rxa4 Bxd4 60. Ra8 Be5+ 61. Kf2 Bd6 62. Re8 Bxb4 {With the two pawn advantage and bishop pair black wins easily}
