[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Byrne (English) attack"]

1. e4 c5 {Here playing black in a blitz game. I'm playing the sicilian defense, since I don't like that much to defend with e5. Sometime I play the Caro-Kann, but I'm not that much experimented with the advance variation that I see often these days.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {I'm going for a sicilian najdorf. a6 protect the square b5 and give the possibility to do b5 later, giving the possibility to counter-attack with b4 or to do Bb7.} 6. Be3 e5 {The immediate e5 give the possibility to develop the bishop for castling and reduce the threat of the knight. White have to chose: Nf3 or Nb3. Ne2 is possible but white will need to move the knight again later to be able to develop the bishop. } 7. Nb3 {For right now the knight look to be blocked by the pawns, but he can be very useful later in the game.} Be7 8. f3 O-O 9. Qd2 b5 {?! b5 is a normal idea of the sicilian, but I think finally Nc6 would have been a better continuation. At this point, I was more experimenting than anything since I don't really know all the variations.} 10. Nd5 Nxd5 {?! Well, I have moved quickly, I didn't like the threats of the knight (Bb6, Nxf6). } 11. Qxd5 {Well I was expecting exd5, I was quite shocked by the position. The queen threats my rook and there is no way I can protect it. My only solution at this point was to try to trap the queen in the corner.} Qc7 {Qc7 was essential to be able to do Bb7 and this way I was able to threat c2 too ,so it could be useful later in the game.} 12. Qxa8 {?! Well I'm still not sure after all that it was a good move. With the accurate defense, I don't see a way for the queen to escape or to gain a big advantage.} Nc6 {! Nc6 blocks the way for the queen to escape and the queen can't go to a7.} 13. Bxb5 {Well nice try at this point, at least he gains a free pawn.} Bb7 14. Qxf8+ Kxf8 15. Bd3 {After the exchange, white still have 2 pt more than I have, but with this kind of position, I still prefer my queen to my 2 rooks. } Nb4 16. O-O {Protecting of Nxc2.} a5 {?! Not Nxc2 because of Rc1. I don't remember the idea of a5, I know it was to do a4 later, forcing the knight to move. Nc1 would have given me the possibility to Nxc2, snatching a pawn for free and I think that 17.Nd2 Nxd3 18.cxd3 Qc2 I would have been able to gain the d pawn without problem.} 17. a3 Nxd3 18. cxd3 Ba6 {Pinning the pawn. If Qc2 then Nxa5 and I don't think it advantage my position.} 19. Rfd1 Bd8 {Thinking about to move my queen, leaving a5 under protection of my bishop. If Rb8 happen I can move my king to e7 without any problem.} 20. d4 Qc2 21. Nd2 {The only possible move.} Bb6 {!} 22. Bg5 {? I don't see at this point a good way for white to get out of this position, but Bg5 just help black.} Bxd4+ 23. Kh1 f6 24. Bh4 g5 25. Bg3 Bxb2 26. Rac1 {?} Bxc1 {White resigned here.}
