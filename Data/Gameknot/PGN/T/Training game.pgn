1. e4 {This was a training game. Graeme divides his time between Malpas, Cheshire and Spain. When he is here he plays bottom board for my team in Division 4 of the Wirral Chess League http://www.wirralchessleague.uk/results.php?club=Malpas_Oswestry&team=2 Oliver is a young 18 year old student who has just joined my club, and I wanted to see how he would fare against a regular member of the side.} e5 {So it starts conventionally enough.} 2. Nf3 {White attacks pawn on e5.} Nc6 {Black protects e5.} 3. Bb5 {White attacks the knight. The Ruy Lopez, otherwise call The Spanish Opening. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruy_Lopez} Bc5 {Black puts his hopes on development.} 4. O-O {White develops.} Nf6 {As does black, attacking e4.} 5. d3 {White protects e4.} O-O {Black castles.} 6. Bxc6 {White sees the chance to win a pawn and takes it.} bxc6 {I prefer recapturing with the d pawn and opening up the c8-h3 diagonal for the Bc8, but this move is also playable. Fritz prefers taking with the b pawn.} 7. Nxe5 {So white takes the pawn.} Bb7 {Playable, but better was Re8 or d5, opening up the position.} 8. Bg5 {White pins the knight.} d6 {Black drives the knight to the square it wants to go. Better 8...B7 to relief the pin.} 9. Ng4 {White now has a massive initiative. Fritz puts white as at least plus 2.} Bd4 {Black tries to protect f6. I thought white could now just drive the black bishop off the diagonal with 10. c2-c3 attacking the bishop, as 10....Be5 is met with 11. d3-d4 or 11. f2-f4. However Fritz points out to me that black can avoid the worse with meeting 10. c2-c3 with 10....Qd7! counter attacking g4. Best for both sides is then 11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. Nxf6 gxf6 13. Qf3 and as well as being a pawn up, black's pawn formation is very weak. Fritz still thinks that 10. c2-c3 is the bext move for white though.} 10. Bxf6 {Instead, white hurries to exchange.} Bxf6 {Black takes back.} 11. Nd2 {Setting a little trap for black. 11...Bxb2 Rb1 and black loses a bishop.} Re8 {So black just develops.} 12. Qe2 {Improving the position of the queen.} Ba6 {Improving the position of the bishop.} 13. e5 {White just throws away his extra pawn.} dxe5 {Better to take with the bishop and keep the e file open for the black rook.} 14. Ne4 {White is threatening again to double black's f pawns.} Bg5 {Which black avoids.} 15. Nxg5 {So white takes.} Qxg5 {Black takes back.} 16. Rfe1 {White develops.} e4 {A very clever move by black. Of course white can't take with the d pawn due to the pin by the bishop on a6.} 17. Ne3 {Knight drops back to block the attack on the e file.} exd3 {Black correctly takes.} 18. cxd3 {White takes back.} Rad8 {Black attacks the d pawn again.} 19. Qc2 {White should protect d3 again with Ra-d1. Black should just take on d3 now.} Re6 {I am not sure why black played this.} 20. Nc4 {This is one way of protecting the d pawn, by shielding the attack from the Ba6.} Qf5 {Black attacks d3 again. } 21. Ne3 {White again leaves the d pawn en prise. Black should just take the pawn with the queen.} Qg6 {Black just drops the queen back.} 22. d4 {White advances the pawn. Black should just take the d pawn with his rook.} Qxc2 {But black takes here instead.} 23. Nxc2 {White takes back with his knight, protecting d4 now.} Bc4 {Bishop attacks a2.} 24. b3 {Counter attacking.} Bd3 {Black correctly attacks the knight protecting the pawn on d4.} 25. Nb4 {Knight attacks bishop!} Rxd4 {Black wins a pawn. White could easily win it back, by exchanging on e6 and then taking on c6, but white doesn't seem to realise this.} 26. Nxd3 {Instead white takes here.} Rxd3 {Rook takes back.} 27. Rad1 {White contests the d file.} Rxd1 {Black takes.} 28. Rxd1 {White takes back.} g6 {Black wants to avoid back rank mates, but 28. ... Rd6 or 28. ....Kf8 are stronger.} 29. g3 {White too, doesn't want to fall to a back-rank mate.} Re7 {Black doesn't want the white rook penetrating to the 7th rank, but instead he lets the rook into the 8th rank. Rd6 or Kf8 again were better moves.} 30. Rd8+ {White throws in a check.} Kg7 {Forced!} 31. Ra8 {Now white is winning the useful a pawn.} Re2 {Black counter-attacks.} 32. Rxa7 {The a pawn goes.} Re1+ {Black throws in a check.} 33. Kg2 {Forced!} Ra1 {Black goes behind the pawn.} 34. a4 {The pawn advances.} Rb1 {Black goes after the b pawn.} 35. Rxc7 {a pawn goes.} Rxb3 {And another.} 36. Rxc6 {And another.} Ra3 {Rook correctly goes behind the pawn.} 37. Ra6 {As does white.} h5 {I am not sure what black is trying to do.} 38. h4 {I would have been tempted just to push the a pawn.} Kh6 {What else?} 39. a5 {At last the a pawn advances.} f5 {Black continues to mess about on the king-side.} 40. Ra8 {Rook to the 8th. White plays the ending of this game well.} Kg7 {King drops back.} 41. a6 {pawn comes forward again.} Kf7 {Black is just marking time.} 42. a7 {pawn goes forward again.} Kg7 {Back again. I thought at this stage that black knew the correct defence, i.e. moving the king between g7 and h7.} 43. f3 {Not sure of the point of this move either.} Kf7 {The fatal last mistake!} 44. Rh8 {Of course!} Rxa7 {Otherwise the pawn queens.} 45. Rh7+ {But it fails to this.} Kg8 {Nothing better.} 46. Rxa7 {And black resigned.
