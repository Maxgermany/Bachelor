[Opening "KGA (C37), Quaade gambit"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {King's gambit... tricky opening as the game will show it.} exf4 {usual answer} 3. Nf3 g5 {The most common answer} 4. Nc3 d6 {Still in the books} 5. Bc4 {Menacing f7} Bg7 {Taking control of the long diagonal and enabling a further Bd4+ (which is black's plan)} 6. O-O {White has castled and is strong on the center but his king can be attacked via the a7 f2 diagonal. Black has 2 options : developp the queenside pi√®ces to enable the castle or use the white's king weakness to attack.} Nc6 {First : develop the center (common move) and taking control of d4} 7. d3 {One of the most common answer, protecting the e pawn and freeing the DSB.} Bg4 {Pinning the knight and developping on the queenside.} 8. h3 {Mistake. It weakens the king and achieve little... White should have carried on developping on the center, unpinning his knight by moving the queen or attacking on the center...} h5 {... for black doesn't have to move the bishop.} 9. hxg4 {Blunder. White falls in the trap and will soon be in big trouble.} hxg4 {Now the white king is in serious danger } 10. Nh2 {Mistake. White has little good move available but 10. Nd2 was better as was 10. Nd5 (abandoning the knight to his doom)} Bd4+ {White submits here for if 11. Be3 Bxe3+ and the situation is the same with one bishop less for white if 11. Kh1 g3 and white is facing an unavoidable mate by 12. Rxh2+mate If 11. Rf2 Bxf2 12. Kxf2 Rxh2 and white is 4 points late in material with a very weak king.}
