1. e4 {Here's a lucky win for Black from the Project.  I feel that I was outplayed for most of this game but ultimately Glenda ((c) Joanne Stevens) came to my rescue!  As usual, we can jump to move 8 for the first points of interest.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 {continuing with my predilection for getting the K to a7 as quickly as possible.} 9. Bxg4 e6 {and this seems to be Black's best move by consensus, helping, as it does, to open lines for Fou Le Noir} 10. Nc3 {White ignores the offered pawn in the interest of developing quickly.} a6 {This creates a hole for Black's King and contests b5 but is it too slow?  Many players have preferred 10....Na6, and after this game I'm inclined to agree with them.} 11. O-O {White, correctly in my view, prefers to castle than to capture the e4 or e6 pawn, continuing to develop quickly before trying to alter the material balance.  The disadvantage of failing to capture the e4 pawn early, though, is that it inhibits the development of the QB and QR by discouraging the d-pawn from moving.} Kb6 {I hasten Henry to his safe haven.} 12. Ngxe4 {Now the e4 pawn drops.  White has puritanically eschewed the temptation of the fork on f7.  Bravo!} Nc6 {Black's earlier slow manoeuvres have allowed his Knight to find its best square.} 13. Kh1 {White plays carefully, quickly evacuating the vulnerable black diagonal.} Nd4 {?! A second move with the Knight before the Rs or KB have moved must be questionable, though the pawn on c2 looks tempting, as does the backwards defence of the e6 pawn.} 14. Na4+ {This check hastens my King to his safe haven but frees White's c-pawn to move and puts pressure on Black's c5 pawn.  White seems to be compounding his positional advantage.} Ka7 15. Naxc5 Bxc5 {As Black still has nominal material advantage, swapping remains in his favour.  The piece being swapped is making its first move, whereas White has invested 3 moves in his knight, so this doesn't seem bad to me.} 16. Nxc5 Re8 {The pawn on e6 has miraculously survived so long that I see no need to give it up immediately.  In the long term I don't expect to retain it but gradually nuntar manoeuvres me into a position where everything seems to depend on holding it, which I can't, and this leads to the denouement.} 17. c3 {Perhaps I should have nicked that pawn, forcing his QR to move, before defending e6?} Nf5 18. d4 {Now White develops his d-pawn to its best square and frees up the QB, simultaneously preventing my Q from jumping to d3 if the Nc5 moved.} Qh4 {I was rather proud of this move at the time, since it simultaneously threatens Ng3+ and Qxg4 but White finds a simple answer} 19. Bh3 {Now I was lost for ideas, so decided to strengthen my N's position without changing the fundamental geometry of the position.} g6 20. Bd2 {White finally connects his rooks and prepares a possible Be1, pushing my Q away.} Rad8 {Completing my development!  There is a possibility here of exploiting a pin on White's d-pawn against his undefended QB by advancing my weak e-pawn, as prepared by my last pawn move.} 21. Rae1 {White prevents that idea by attacking e5 and e6 } Rd6 {Already I can see that my e6 pawn is about to become indefensible but for now I defend it anyway.} 22. Re2 {White prepares to double rooks on the e-file.  This looks nasty.} b6 {So I chase away one of the attackers} 23. Ne4 {which responds by attacking one of my defenders} Rdd8 {I preferred to defend the other rook than to invite a pawn advance to d5 if I'd played ...Rc6, when my e-pawn would have been virtually pinned (though not immediately as White's N blocks the rook's attack down the e-file).  Concrete calculation, rather than reliance on unsubstantiated fears and worries and hopes would have served me better here!} 24. Ng5 {Now White has two immediate attackers on e6, while Black has just one defender, but my most natural defensive move, ...Ng7, merely reveals another White attack from h3.  I don't want to concede a draw by repetition with several iterations of ... Rd6, so what do I do?} Rd6 {well, for now, I play the conservative ...Rd6, putting the ball in White's court to prove that he has something.} 25. Rfe1 {By simply doubling rooks, White brings overpowering force to bear on e6.} Ng7 {I knew this was insufficient to defend the pawn but felt that this gave me most options for a constructive continuation after the inevitable loss of the pawn, based on back row threats with my Q and fork of the potentially undefended B on d2.} 26. g3 Qh5 {This is a more potent position for Glenda than h4 was...} 27. Bxe6 {when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall...} Nxe6 28. Nxe6 Qd5+ {down will come baby, cradle and all.  Faced with loss of the Knight, White resigned.  A lucky escape for me.}
