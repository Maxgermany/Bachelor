1. d4 {Welcome to my Trompowsky annotation. This opponent had previously employed the Samisch to attack my King's Indian Defense when we last played with the same colors. The success of the KID in that game had me on red alert for what to expect from this encounter.} Nf6 {I proceed with my KID.} 2. Bg5 {This introduces the Trompowsky Attack. White does not want a conventional King's Indian Defense and intends to take the game into original territory by exchanging bishop for knight and doubling Black's f-pawns. } Ne4 {White has essentially put the question to the knight (and the pawns that would have had to recapture). Black has a number of responses here including 2_c5, 2_e6, and the text. I prefer the text because it often leads to active positional play and because I also like reflecting White's strategy by putting the question back on the bishop.} 3. Bf4 {3.h4 is also currently fashionable.} c5 {Both sides have a minor piece that has been developed, attacked, and moved again. Black plays 3_c5 hoping to maintain the knight on e4 or at least gain a concession before retreating it. } 4. f3 {Now White enters one of the most popular lines of the Tromp. Whether the game remains open or closed (and it can do both from this tabia in my experience) the play is usually very sharp. Since my worthy opponent had previously employed the Samisch it seems fitting here that he employs a system with a similar pawn structure (f3) that is so thematic in that opening as well. This move does challenge the knight on the e4 square but it does so at the cost of White taking away the best development square from his own knight (see previous note).} Qa5+ {This is the point of Black's previous move. It allows the knight on e4 to influence White's game before it has to retreat (or be exchanged).} 5. c3 {Logical. } Nf6 {White has an important decision to make.} 6. Nd2 {6.d5 is a strong alternative that grabs space. The text, however, is usually going for an endgame where White's better pawns are mitigated by Black's bishop pair.} cxd4 {Freeing my Queen from having to recapture on the next move and exposing the fifth rank to my queen's influence (no Bg5 repetitions thank you!).} 7. Nb3 {This is what White is playing for when he plays 6.Nd2.} Qb6 8. Qxd4 Qxd4 {8_Nc6 is the popular move here. But I like the text better. White wanted an endgame with the better pawns. Had I played 8_Nc6 White could have proceeded with 9.Qxb6 when 9_axb6 is just the pawn-weakening White was aiming for.} 9. Nxd4 {I was expecting 9.cxd4 when White has a formidable center that Black will have to be careful about handling. With the piece recapture it gives Black, at the cost of a few forced moves, an easier game in my opinion.} a6 {Keeping the knight away from b5 and c7.} 10. e4 {Logical. Improving the White position, releasing the White squared bishop (that once deployed will allow the g1 knight an opportunity on the e2 square), and threatening 11.e5.} d6 {This felt forced for me. Its obvious I'm trying to punish the knight recapture on move 9 with a fork on the e5 square. But the text also prevents 11.e5 and opens the diagonal for my own White squared bishop.} 11. Nb3 {Avoiding the fork and putting an eye on the a5 square. } e5 {This was going to be a KID if you remember. I was hoping to get in Be6 & d5 (potentially with a knight on b6 and a rook on d8 defending) making the d6 pawn backward only temporarily. White could prevent it but would have to forgo developing his kingside pieces.} 12. Bg5 {Of course. He did play a Tromp against me to avoid the KID if you remember. 8)} Be6 {I continue with my plan. I thought about playing Be7 and then castling but with the queens overboard I wanted to make sure I wouldn't be hustling my King from the corner back to the center in an endgame. If he wants to relinquish the bishop pair then he can but the doubled f-pawns, though annoying, won't be the structural disaster it would have been on move 3.} 13. Rd1 {Logical and direct. Black's plan for d5 now needs more preparation.} Nbd7 {A knight on b6 would support the d5 push (that's where this knight is headed). It also releases the a8 rook and removes the annoying potential for doubled f-pawns.} 14. Na5 {I had considered this when I first played 12_Be6. The knight attacks the pawn on b7 and readies for Nc4. } b6 {I considered 14_b5 directly here but it appeared to give Black some counterplay with 15.b3 and 16.c4. Here is where I made the real decision that losing the d6 pawn is ok AND that castling would actually remove Black's king from its important influence in the center.} 15. Bxf6 {Making the d6 capture possible.} Nxf6 16. Nc4 {White's plan is realized.} b5 {Move the pawn that can be defended.} 17. Nxd6+ {Check!} Bxd6 {I'm glad I didn't waste a tempo putting the bishop on e7.} 18. Rxd6 Ke7 {Now Black really isn't threatening the White rook (which can simply move away) but the text does free the other Black rook. That said, now look at the White kingside.} 19. Rd2 {Where else was it going to go?} Bxa2 {The d6 pawn is avenged! If I can keep the d-file from being infiltrated by a White rook battery with my king and minor pieces then I can attack the queenside freely wih my rooks.} 20. Ne2 {Developing the knight with future plans such as 21.f4 or 21.Nc1 & 22.b3.} Nd7 {I can always retreat the bishop and be happy with it on e6 so I decide to meet the possibility of 21.f4.} 21. Ng3 {The bishop had to get free somehow.} g6 {Taking away squares for the knight. And once my bishop almost inevitably retreats e6 I will have f-file ideas of my own.} 22. Be2 Be6 {It was going to happen eventually. } 23. Kf2 {Logical.} Nc5 {Headed for queenside play.} 24. Rhd1 {White is now the owner of a d-file battery. But what can be done with it?} Rhc8 {I continue the queenside offensive.} 25. Bd3 {This stops any Bb3 ideas from Black and prepares for more queenside influence. } Rab8 {Preparing for b4.} 26. Bc2 {Logical follow through from the previous move.} b4 {Black continues trying to break through on the queenside.} 27. Ne2 {Bringing the knight closer to the fray.} a5 {Keeping up the pressure.} 28. Ke3 {White's king bolsters for a possible f4 push but the queenside will quickly draw the knight away from any supporting duties in that plan.} a4 {I thought this move forced White to take the pawn on b4. The alternative is queenside domination.} 29. cxb4 {Forced?} Rxb4 {Black breaks through knowing that White now has the forces to liquidate the queenside pawns.} 30. Nc3 {White goes after the pawn.} Rxb2 {Black accepts the trade.} 31. Bxa4 {And White removes the last pawn.} Rb4 {The bishop still seems wanting for squares though.} 32. Bc2 Nb3 {The knight attacks the White rook while preparing for Nd4 and leaves a discovered attack on White's knight on c3. } 33. Rd2d3 Nd4 {Black occupies the strong outpost on d4 and White is running out of maneuvering room. } 34. Rc1 {A hard move to make.} Rb2 {Black penetrates the White position.} 35. Bd1 {35.Ba4 would amount to the same thing.} f5 {This is not so much my resisting the pawn grab 35_Rxg2 in as much as its my failing to resist a mate threat with 36_f4.} 36. g3 {I can still grab a pawn on the Black kingside. But that mate threat...has it really been nullified?} g5 {Nope.} 37. Rxd4 {Forced.} exd4+ 38. Kxd4 {And now that I am up the exchange I will surely grab the h2 pawn and try to convert it to a win right? My last game with this opponent proved to me that I need every last advantage.} Rd2+ {I see something more appealing.} 39. Ke3 Rxd1 {Two for one!} 40. Rxd1 Rxc3+ 41. Rd3 f4+ {The point of the previous liquidation.} 42. gxf4 gxf4+ 43. Kd4 Rxd3+ 44. Kxd3 Bb3 {Making way for the king on the important e-file and lusting after the f3 pawn.} 45. Ke2 Kf6 46. Kf1 Bd1 {Originally I played this to pin the king down to the defense of the f-pawn. But then I realized that the pawns are equal in the number of their potential moves on the h-file. This seemed a small fact but it made my next move possible.} 47. Kf2 {Defending.} Bxf3 {This was what I realized on my last move. Once the King recaptures there is nowhere for him to go that can protect the e4 pawn. And since the h-file is moot, he has no choice in the matter.} 48. e5+ {Amounts to the same thing.} Kxe5 49. Kxf3 Kf5 {And the game is over (though White resigned a few moves later).} 50. h3 h5 51. Ke2 Ke4 {}
