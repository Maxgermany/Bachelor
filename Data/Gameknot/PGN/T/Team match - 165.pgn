[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian defense.} 2. e5 {Pc5 is a popular response for black.} h5 {This, not so much.} 3. Be2 f6 4. d4 g6 5. Nf3 e6 6. Nc3 f5 7. Bg5 Be7 {Not counting pawns white has three pieces on the field.  Black has one.} 8. O-O Bxg5 9. h4 {Highly questionable.  Best not to disrupt the castle pawns, especially when black can have it for free.} Bxh4 10. g3 Bg5 11. Nd2 {Black is up four, every even trade now favors him.} h4 12. gxh4 Bxh4 13. Bb5+ {Easily defended.  Bf3 might have been better.} c6 14. Ba4 {It is now force mate in three.} Qg5+ 15. Kh1 {Two.} Bxf2+ {Qh5 is, of course, pointless.  Fast game.}
