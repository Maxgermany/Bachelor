[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian defense. This is probably the most defying and exciting response to white's opening e4} 2. Bc4 {Decides to deviate from common Nf3 however, this is quite good as well} d6 3. d3 e6 {Even from here it is noticeable that this will be a more positional Sicilian than the sharp battles we're used to seeing.} 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nf3 Be7 {preparation for castling} 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 {Not a bad trade. a bad bishop is traded for a bad bishop and black remains slightly ahead in development} 8. O-O O-O {Both kings are safe! The opening is coming to an end! Time for each player to assert their ideas.} 9. Ne2 {shifting attention to the kingside} Rc8 {Black figures he's most likely to strike gold on the queenside} 10. Ng3 h6 {simply a case of prophylaxis} 11. c4 {This is done to prevent d5 however it does leave a hole on d4 and a potential problem, the backward pawn on d3. The backward pawn is not weak right now because the d file is closed.} Ne5 {interesting move. If white plays Nxe5 then dxe5 and the d3 pawn would then be exposed to attack. If that doesn't happen black can also consider capturing the knight on f3 (best placed minor piece). Or move to c6 to put more control on the hole on d4.} 12. Nxe5 dxe5 {a fresh target is created on d3. keep in mind the double pawns are not bad in this position.} 13. Be3 Qd7 {Preparing to bring the rook as an attacking reinforcement} 14. Qc2 {preparing to defend the next move with a rook} Rfd8 15. Rfd1 Rc6 16. Rd2 b6 {b6 is played to solidify the c5 pawn} 17. Qc3 Ng4 {adequate defense. f3 fails to Nxe3. h3 follows Nxe3 fxe3 Bg5.} 18. Nf1 {White decides a more defensive approach is needed} Nxe3 19. Nxe3 Qd4 {here if white plays Qxd4, black responds Rxd4 and not exd4} 20. Qa3 Bg5 {a tactical threat. if Qxa7 Bxe3 fxe3+ Re2 Qxd3. This leaves black in command of the d file.     A trade of 1 pawn for 2 and white's pawns on c4 and e4 would become new targets.} 21. Re1 {defends the tactic} Qd7 {defends a7} 22. Qc3 {A similar position arose on move 17} f6 {This move looks bad because it places the pawn on a dark square and blocks the bishop out. However it is better than Bf6 and believe it or not the bishop is in no immediate danger. The pawn is defended and the bad bishop is actively pinning the knight outside the pawn chain!} 23. b3 h5 {Finally the bishop gets some room} 24. a3 Rd6 {I call this the imperfect battery because the queen is second in line and not last} 25. Red1 Qc7 26. Re2 {the pin is removed} Rd8d7 27. Nc2 Qd8 {Now the perfect battery} 28. Ne1 {adding reinforcement to d3} Rd6d4 {this pins the e2 rook to the e4 pawn. If it moves on one of its safe squares i.e (c2, b2,a2) then black's rook will capture on e4 winning a pawn.} 29. a4 g6 30. Rb2 {white leaves his guard} Rxe4 {black wins a pawn} 31. Nf3 Bh6 32. Qc2 Rf4 {giving way so e4 is possible} 33. Qe2 e4 {white can't play dxe4?? or else Rxd1+ Ne1 winning a rook} 34. Ne1 {adds defense to d3} exd3 35. Qxe6+ Kg7 36. Qh3 Re4 37. Nf3 d2 {this puts pressure on the defense, limits the movement of the b2 rook and pins the d1 rook to its square} 38. Kf1 Rd3 {yet another pin. the knight is pinned to the queen} 39. Qg3 Qd7 {This is to prevent Qc7+} 40. h3 Bf4 {the queen was looking to run to h2 then h1 or g1. I could not allow that to happen.} 41. Qh4 Qe6 {protects the rook on e4 to enable a discovered attack.} 42. Rbb1 Bc7 {discovered attack!} 43. Ng5 fxg5 44. Qxg5 Bd8 {BAAM!! The final punch, a queen trap. White resigns! This game was played between me and my very good friend on another site. I hope that you enjoyed watching this game as much as I enjoyed playing it.}
