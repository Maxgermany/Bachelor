1. c4 e5 {first time i try this move against c4... And i did it accidentally, not really thinking of my moves. Let's see what it will arrive. maybe i could priviledge it.} 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. d4 exd4 {i already like it.} 4. Qxd4 Nc6 {maybe 3 d4 is not very strong.} 5. Qd1 {losing a tempo} Bb4 6. Bd2 d6 7. g3 O-O 8. Bg2 Bf5 {all my minor pieces are developped and i have castled. White still has to develop a knight and to castle.} 9. Nf3 Qe7 10. O-O Rfe8 {I am clearly up about moves, but is it sufficient to dominate? Of course not. I even like white position right now as well as black...} 11. Nd5 {taking the offensive to reverse my spatial advantage. I think it is a good move} Nxd5 12. cxd5 {occupying center. Definitely a good move, was Nd5} Bxd2 13. Qxd2 Ne5 14. Nd4 Bg6 {black is back to defense... white has reversed the machine. My only advantage here is the e-column. and it is not evident} 15. b3 Nd7 16. e3 {white terminates my advantage.} Nc5 {i have to find new spaces.} 17. Rad1 a5 {and avoid to let white space.} 18. Rfe1 b6 {leaving c6 for the knight. I have carefully thought about this. the idea is that Nc6 is not as useful as it looks like (wrong idea), and that i have to free my rook from a5 defence.} 19. Nc6 Qf6 20. Bf1 Ne4 {taking some space... not hoping for...} 21. Qe2 {this, as a troubling mistake!} Nc3 22. Qb2 {best after last mistake} Nxd1 23. Qxf6 gxf6 24. Rxd1 {the quality is partially compensated by the bad pawn structure} Bf5 {preventing...} 25. Bb5 {... this} Bd7 {forced and archi-forced} 26. Rd4 {white is more mobile than black, and has to take profit of it. } Kg7 {and king is the only mobile white piece. actually, i have to free my rooks.} 27. e4 {hm... maybe white could have moved the king} Reg8 28. a4 Rae8 {rooks have a minimum of space now.} 29. f4 Bxc6 {the most dangerous white piece is gone} 30. Bxc6 Re7 {white still dominates the queen side and the clear squares.} 31. Kf2 Kf8 {actually i was looking for a plan to pass, and felt ready to give back something to do it, like a pawn. But which one?} 32. Kf3 h5 {just after i made the move, I felt sorry: it was clearly exposed to the bishop.} 33. h3 Rg7 34. Bb5 f5 {i have to open.} 35. Bd3 fxe4+ 36. Rxe4 Rxe4 37. Bxe4 {am I better? I still have to pass...} Ke7 {dark squares are my kingdom} 38. f5 Kf6 39. Kf4 {contests my kingdom} Rg8 {looking for the passage.} 40. Bf3 Rh8 41. Be4 Kg7 42. Kg5 f6+ 43. Kf4 {i guess white would be happy with a draw... i am not sure.} Re8 {i felt now the way to get in: I have three ways to potentially go, that he has to guard: 1)} 44. Kf3 Kh6 45. Kf4 Rb8 {2)} 46. Bd3 Rg8 {3)} 47. Be4 Re8 {so now I have to find how to attract the bishop in a way to be able to pass.} 48. h4 {ah... now white is in quasi-zugzwang} Rb8 {1...} 49. Bd3 Rg8 {2...} 50. Be2 Re8 {done -3!} 51. Bc4 Re1 {passed} 52. Kf3 Kg7 53. Kf4 Rc1 {now i have to put white in zugzwang again...} 54. Ke4 Rc3 {push the king back} 55. Kf4 Kh6 {white can't move the king, can't move the bishop...} 56. g4 hxg4 57. Kxg4 {good! ha has freed a space!} Re3 {new zugzwang to make} 58. Kf4 Re5 {if he goes back to g4 or g3, I play Re4... } 59. Bd3 {well there was no good option... but i am not sure losing d5 was the best...} Rxd5 {gnap!} 60. Ke4 Re5+ {back to the same problem} 61. Kd4 {strange...} Kh5 62. Kc4 Kxh4 {gnap} 63. b4 {desperate and hopeless} axb4 64. Kxb4 Kg5 65. Bc2 Kf4 {preparing the passage of d6-5-4, etc.} 66. Bd3 Ke3 67. Bb5 {oh?... well} Rxf5 {gnap} 68. Bd7 Rc5 69. Be8 f5 {and white resigns... i may be bad at endgame, this is not reall hard to win...}
