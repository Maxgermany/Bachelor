1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3 {I often play the Scottish gambit, but I found that against 2...d6 3. d4 xd4 4. Bc4 is rather lackluster. I therefroe tried to prepare for d4 this time, trying to create a strong centre. } f5 4. d4 {A bit too optimistic perhaps. After 4....xe4 5. Ng5 d5 6. xe5, black's centre looks stronger.} fxe4 5. Ng5 Bf5 {Instead black decides to develop, which also nets him a strong centre, but allows me to stick an annoying pawn at e5} 6. dxe5 d5 7. f3 {Contesting black's centre. If I get to trade, my centre is similar to that of black and if he decides to trade, I will develop my queen and create more open files which may be used later to create strength out of my isolated passed pawn.0} Be7 {Letting me trade means the e-pawn will not easily turn into a monster. On the other hand, I get to trade queens on my terms, which ends up costing black quite a few tempi} 8. fxe4 dxe4 9. Qxd8+ Bxd8 10. Bc4 {Quick development is of great importance, since seizing the open files besides the passed pawns on the e-file will be instrumental to make yours a danger before your opponent can attack you with his. The bishop on c4 helps preventing that black will castle short.} Bxg5 11. Bxg5 h6 {Black is rather behind in development and would therefore probably be better off by getting his knights into play. } 12. O-O {develops with a tempo} Bg6 {Best placed, but blocks the g-pawn, so the double advance to g5 to grab space won't be possible} 13. Bh4 Ne7 14. Na3 c6 {Creates an outpost on d5, but also a weakness on d6. I think simply developing with Nc6 seems stronger and then answer 15. Nb5 with castling long.} 15. Nc2 b5 16. Be6 Nd7 17. Bg3 Nc5 {17....0-0-0 is still not an option, since 18. Rad1 leads to problems.} 18. Bg4 {This covers potential threats from the black e-pawn, but opens up the possibility for black to play h5-h4 at some point, so perhaps it was suboptimal compared to Bh3.} Rd8 {Black basically has no hope of castling any time soon, so he gets his rook into play like this instead. The king in the centre actually turns out to be a problem, though once I get my pieces to active squares with the help of my e-pawn.} 19. Nd4 {blocks the d-file so that black can not cause mayhem on the second row and makes my knihgt more active at the same time.} Bf7 {shields the f-file, so castling short becomes an option, but importantly, it concedes control over f5 momentarily, where my knight may cause some trouble.} 20. b4 {Trying to keep the initiative. After Nd3 the plan was to play 21. Nf5 Nxf5 22. Bxf5. After 22....Bd5 23. e6 looks very dangerous with the prospect of Bg6 and after 22....e3 23. Rf3 looks quite strong.} Na4 {But black opts for a different line of attack.} 21. Rac1 Nxc3 {Black looks to win a pawn, either through 22. Rxc3 Rxd4 or through 22. Nxc6 Nxc6 23. Rxc3 Nxb4, but taking the latter variation a few steps further ends up looking rather disastrous for black.} 22. Nxc6 Nxc6 23. Rxc3 Nxb4 24. e6 {Chasing away the bishop so the king will be stuck in the centre, where he can be easily attacked.} Bg6 25. Rc7 Rg8 {The g-pawn looks like it is rather important, but perhaps it would have been better for black to just let it go in order to better defend against the impending attack.} 26. Bh4 {Threatening checkmate on e7, while attacking the rook on d8. Simply moving away with the rook on the last row leads to 27. e7, threatening Bd7 and moving it along the d-file of course loses to 27. Rc8 Rd8 28. Rxd8#} Nd5 27. Bxd8 {Wins a piece, as I can recapture on c7, bringing my bishop to safety. } Kxd8 {even worse, as white will now be a rook ahead.} 28. Rd7+ Ke8 29. Rxd5 Rf8 30. Rfd1 Rf4 31. Rd5d8+ Ke7 32. Rd1d7+ Kf6 33. Rf8+ Ke5 34. Rxf4 {34. e7 Was a bit more elegant, but being a rook down, black has seen enough anyways and concedes.}
