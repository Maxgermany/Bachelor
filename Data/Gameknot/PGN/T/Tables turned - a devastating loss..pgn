[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence"]

1. e4 {While I was winning my two games against grietje, I also lost this shocker against my buddy Derek.  We usually play unrated games but I'd forgotten to tick the box for this one and paid the price!  While, at present, our ratings are far apart, Derek's is often higher than mine, so he is not to be taken lightly.  I get a bit cocky in this game and pay the price.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 {Derek plays a number of responses to the Ruy Lopez.  This is the Steinitz, an old and venerable line, which I don't know very well.  The principled 19th century approach would be to launch the d pawn immediately but the Nimzowitschean approach is to prevent Black from putting his pieces on ideal squares, so...} 4. h3 Bd7 {Black probably wanted to play this anyway!} 5. O-O Nf6 6. Re1 {In the Orthodox Defence, White would leave the e-pawn undefended for a move or two but there's no need to do so here and, compared with the Classical Defence, the R doesn't need to defend f2 against a Bc5.} a6 7. Ba4 Be7 8. c3 O-O 9. d3 {The last few moves have been typical Ruy Lopez moves.  This is an unambitious move in the style of Michael Adams.  White refrains from contesting the centre while he completes his development.  Note that White has only developed two minor pieces to Black's four...} b5 10. Bc2 {Retreating the full distance so as not to have to move again if Black attacks the Bb3 with his N.  Often the B only retreats to b3, so as to prevent Black from launching his f-pawn but, in this position, in order to prepare that, Black would have to play some ugly moves with his f6 N.} a5 {grabbing space on the Queenside} 11. Nbd2 {In order to develop the final two minor pieces and preserve the bishop pair, White has to embark on a standard Ruy Lopez manoeuvre with the Queen's Knight, which will come go via f1 to either e3 or g3 and then either d5 or f5 if all goes to (flexible) plan.} Nb8 {Undeveloping the N to allow the c-pawn to advance.  Black has time for this because of White's slow manoeuvring.} 12. Nf1 c5 13. Ne3 Nc6 14. b3 a4 {Black continues his Queenside attack with vigour.} 15. bxa4 bxa4 16. Bxa4 {but loses a pawn} Nd4 {!?  a bolt from the blue, as Fritz would say} 17. Bxd7 Nxd7 18. cxd4 cxd4 19. Nf5 {Now White is a whole piece up, with a  lovely remote passed pawn, which could be a decisive factor in the endgame if it lasts that long, so seeks to swap off another piece.} Nc5 {which Black allows, meanwhile restraining White's passed pawn.} 20. Nxe7+ Qxe7 21. Bg5 Qa7 22. Nh4 {While Black seeks to attack on the Queenside, White is at last in a position to attack on the Kingside.} Qa3 {! A nasty move that I'd missed.  White can't defend the d-pawn directly.} 23. Be7 {So White seeks compensation by forking R and d-pawn.} Rfe8 24. Bxd6 Re6 {and Black gains tempi for his rook by chasing the B} 25. Nf5 Qa5 {the pin on the N prevented it from taking the d-pawn.  If the Q had taken the d-pawn, the N would have fallen.} 26. Qg4 {There's nothing quite like threatening mate in one, even if it is easily defended against.} g6 27. Reb1 Nxd3 {Black gets his pawn} 28. Rb8+ {and White pursues his attack} Rxb8 29. Bxb8 Qd2 {now Black turns his attention to White's King, threatening f2} 30. a4 {?? which White chooses to ignore!  A passed pawn must be pushed ... but is this the right time to do so?} Qb2 {!  Nasty fork of R and B, while the f2 pawn is still threatened.} 31. Nh6+ {When caught out like that, I try to cause a diversion and hope that something will turn up.} Kg7 32. Nf5+ Kh8 {avoiding repetition.  Black knows he's on top now.} 33. Bxe5+ {Derek asked "Did that help?", to which I replied that with the R and B forked, I thought I might as well get a pawn in compensation.  Unfortunately, Black proceeds to exploit the open diagonals better than White.} Nxe5 34. Qd1 gxf5 {ouch.  Now I've gone from being a piece up to being a piece down.} 35. exf5 Rf6 36. g4 Rh6 37. Kg2 Qc3 {The king-hunt has started in earnest.} 38. Qh1 Nxg4 {! ouch again.  The h-pawn is pinned against my Q.} 39. a5 {Will this pawn save me after all?} Ne5 40. a6 Qf3+ {! Black seizes the long diagonal with devastating effect.} 41. Kg1 Qxf5 {and picks up a loose pawn on the way, attacking the h-pawn and threatening ... Nf3  or ... Ng4 or ... Nd3 followed by ... Qxf2#} 42. a7 Rg6+ {Attacking the King is an urgent priority with the pawn about to Queen.} 43. Kf1 Qd3+ {the King cuts of the Q and R's mutual defence, making them both vulnerable.  A fork follows.} 44. Ke1 Qc3+ 45. Ke2 {Mutual defence is temporarily restored.} Qb2+ {but not for long as the d-pawn and N prevent the K from advancing} 46. Kd1 Qxa1+ 47. Kc2 {hoping against hope that Derek might take the pawn ...} Qxh1 {That's quite enough of that.  Well played Derek; not so well played by me.}
