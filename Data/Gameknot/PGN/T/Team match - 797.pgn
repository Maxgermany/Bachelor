1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 {Always an interesting line!} d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 {Normal here is 5... Na5 I think (6. Bb5  c6 7.dxc6 bxc6 8.Be2), but this is fun and sharp, with a lot of potential traps for black to fall into.} 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+ Qf6 8. Bxd5+ {Maybe Qxd5  is better? (8... Be6 Qd7 )} Be6 9. Bxe6+ Kxe6 10. Qxf6+ Kxf6 11. c3 {I actually prefer black all of a sudden. One pawn in material and an isolated black pawn seems to be little consolation for such advanced black development.  c3 was to prevent Nb4 or Nd4 and the risk of a pawn fork. I could not see a strong move here for white...} Bc5 12. b4 {Primarily to allow bishop development, but it leaves the d pawn very weak if I move the bishop.} Bb6 13. O-O Rhe8 14. d3 {I was panicking here -- I think a4 would have been better, as Ra2 is then a possibility.} Rad8 15. Rd1 e4 16. d4 Nxd4 {Cunning. 17.cxd4 leads to Rxd4 18. Rxd4 Bxd4 losing the a1 rook -- not capturing the rook leaves the mate threat. Perhaps 17.cxd4 Rxd4 18. Re1 would have worked?} 17. Nd2 Ne2+ 18. Kf1 {Very low on defence here, but after 18... Nxc1 19. Raxc1 e3 20. fxe3 the knight has better chances of being released.} Nf4 {A get out of jail free clause! I'm guessing black was relying on the threat of 19... e3, thinking it was safe from Nxe4 due to the Rxd1# threat. However, the king on f6 makes it possible!} 19. Nxe4+ {I now have a pawn advantage and can start exchanging material. Black definitely had the upper hand positionally for quite some time in this game, and hopefully it is now closer to level.} Kf5 20. Ng3+ Kg4 {Aside from the mate threat, I cannot understand this move...} 21. Bxf4 {This was following up my intent to swap material and do something with the remaining extra pawn. However, I think this is a blunder. 21.f3 Kg5 22. h4! seems to win the knight for a pawn... never mind! Now expecting 21... Kxf4 22. Nh5  winning the g7 pawn.} Rxd1+ 22. Rxd1 Kxf4 23. Nh5+ Kg5 {Aha, cunning, looking at 24. Nxg7 there is clearly a trap being prepared with 24... Re7. Initially the pawn now looks safe, but there is still 25. Rd5  to consider, giving the knight two safe squares to run to - Has to be worth a shot whilst e1 and e2 are safe from the black rook.} 24. Nxg7 Re7 25. Rd5+ Kg6 26. Nf5 Rf7 {Hmm, aiming for Rxf2  I think. Need to keep the pawn defended whilst retaining the initiative.} 27. Nh4+ Kg7 28. f3 {The only choice I think to preserve the pawn. I don't like white's exposure to the bishop and rook, but with a two pawn advantage things are looking quite good at this stage.} c6 29. Rd2 {Rd8 is not possible, so holding onto the file whilst defending seemed logical -- very passive move though.} Rf4 {Cunning, can't move the knight, have to play a pawn -- pawn structure will be a shambles now.} 30. g3 Rc4 31. Rd3 {Fortunately I can play this whilst remaining on the white squares, away from the highly active black bishop.} c5 32. bxc5 Bxc5 {Helps the bishop maintain activity, and totally isolates the c3 pawn (on a black square unfortunately :(    ) - it would be nice to get rid of the bishop, which is the only real current thorn in white's gameplan now as it covers so much of the board.} 33. Nf5+ {Playing to reactivate the knight. I would like to play Nd6 to get the knight off the board. Sadly it will cost the c3 pawn though and that's too big a sacrifice for me with a Rook-Rook ending, despite my passed f pawn.} Kg6 {Ah, this is useful, now Nd6 works.} 34. Nd6 {After the bishop captures (forced because of loss of pawn or rook), Rxd6  is now check, allowing me to get back and defend my pawn.} Bxd6 35. Rxd6+ Kg5 36. Rd3 {This seems much better for white now, I still need to make use of my king, but the passed pawn should prove very powerful.} Ra4 37. Rd2 {Getting the rook to C2 to defend both pawns.} Ra3 38. Rc2 Kg6 39. Ke2 Kf5 40. Ke3 {Activating my king - now to try and take advantage of the two extra pawns.} Ke5 41. h3 Kf5 42. h4 {41. g4 Kg5 prevents 42. h4, so I play this first, as all the squares are now inaccessible to the king. 42... h5 I can play Kd3 and aim for Re2 and force the king away.} Kg6 43. g4 b5 44. Kf4 {Deciding to force my way through with the King} Ra4+ 45. Ke5 h6 46. Rd2 {Aiming to play the check and keep the pawns running.} Ra3 47. Rd6+ Kg7 48. Rd7+ Kg6 49. h5+ {Everything starts falling apart. This was such a poor move. Much better was accepting the mistake of Rd7 , returning to Rd6  and push the g pawn.} Kg5 50. Rg7+ Kh4 51. Rc7 {Now I return to defending, and have some serious difficulties as the black a pawn is now passed.} Rxa2 52. Kf5 {Again, I think Rc6 would have been much better - this is probably the game losing move.} Kg3 53. f4 Rf2 54. Rf7 Rxf4+ 55. Kg6 Rxf7 56. Kxf7 a5 {I misread this -- I thought I was a move ahead playing Kg6, Kxh6 and Kg6 again, which is bizarre as I think the calculations were two moves out.  Sometimes greed gets the better of me :)  Top marks to bloedeter for finishing the game so solidly.  Game annotation for team benefit --}
