[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian defense.} 2. exd5 {Lasker variation of the Scandinavian defense. } Qxd5 3. c3 {Nc3 is much more popular for white, as it helps develop pieces while pushing the black queen.} Qe4+ 4. Be2 {Oh, the knight or queen would have been much better choices.  This bishop was all that was protecting little Pg2, which it turn was protecting white's h rook.} Qxg2 5. Bf3 {Nice recovery for white.} Qg6 6. b4 Qe6+ 7. Ne2 b6 {?  Black inexplicably offers up his a rook as a free sacrifice.} 8. Bxa8 Qd6 9. Qa4+ c6 10. Qxa7 Qd5 {While making a counter threat on white's rook is admirable, QxN followed by QxB will be curtains for black.} 11. Qxb8 Qxh1+ 12. Ng1 Qxg1+ 13. Ke2 {Here perhaps Qg4 is in order.} Qg4+ {Excellent!} 14. Ke3 Qe6+ 15. Kd3 Qg6+ 16. Kc4 b5+ 17. Kc5 e6+ {Pushing this pawn two squares checks the king while allowing the queen greater access across the 6th rank--AND allows her to protect Pc6 from KxPc6.} 18. Kxc6 Ne7+ 19. Kc7 Qf5 20. Bc6+ Nxc6 21. Qxc8+ Ke7 22. Kxc6 Qf3+ {Oh, I like Qd5+ a lot better.  It protects Pb5, and gets much more close and personal with the white king.} 23. Kc7 g5 {This move is an invitation for Qd8#.} 24. Qd8# {Interesting game!}
