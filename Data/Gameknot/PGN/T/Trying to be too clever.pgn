[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {The Reti opening. This forces me to make a different move, as I would normally play e5, but the pawn would instantly be removed.} Nc6 {So I develop my queenside knight, instead. It contests the dark squares in the centre, and woul allow me to double-step my king's pawn, depending on the next move.} 2. d4 {He moves his queen's pawn two spaces, so this scuppers my plan. My king's pawn would be captured, and I'd be a pawn down.} d5 {So I move up my queen's pawn two spaces. Her bishop has some freedom of the h3-c8 diagonal, but the queen has not as many squares as I would have wanted her to control.} 3. Qd3 {He moves his queen out to plan an assault. He now has more developed pieces.} Nb4 {I decide to attack her with my knight. I might be over-developing here...} 4. Qb5+ {...as the queen moves in to attack my king. I have four pieces to block the check here, and one was the right piece...} Qd7 {...but the queen was not one of them. I tried to be too clever here, attacking the queen...} 5. Qxb4 {...when it was clearly leaving my knight en prise, and she captures it. I should have blocked with my knight. I didn't realise I could have used it instead of my queen.} Qf5 {I move my free queen up to attack the pawn on c2. That was a bit of a brave move...} 6. Na3 {...but this was the obvious reply, developing the knight to cover it. I am allowing him do continue his development.} Nf6 {So I bring out my remaining knight to try to help her, and to try to regain some control of the centre...} 7. Qa5 {...and he eyes up my pawn on c7 with his queen...} c6 {...so I move it out of the way, also to cover my queen's pawn.} 8. e3 {He creates a similar chain by moving his king's pawn one square, to cover his queen's pawn. His light-square bishop now has some freedom, and could launch an attack down the f1-a6 diagonal.} b6 {I move up my b-pawn to attack the queen, and to free my bishop form the shorter diagonal...} 9. Qc3 {...forcing her back to eye up my c-pawn from in front. I need to think of a plan to defend it...} Ne4 {...but again I was trying to be too clever, attacking her with my knight...} 10. Qxc6+ {...when she was obviously going to remove my pawn, and fork my king and rook...} Kd8 {...so I move my king into my queen's starting position to get closer to the bishop...} 11. Qxa8 {...but I lose my rook to his queen. I am really falling apart here! Serves me right for trying to be too clever.} e6 {What was I thinking moving my king's pawn here? It blocks the queen's path to her bishop...} 12. Ba6 {...and he brings his light-square bishop to attack mine, which is now in trouble...} e5 {...so I move up my king's pawn to clear the path for my queen. This actually leads my pawn into trouble, as it is under attack from his queen's pawn.} 13. Bxc8 {As expected, I lose my bishop. It just goes from bad to worse here...} Qxc8 {...and I finally capture a piece, by recapturing his bishop with my queen. It still leaves me well in arrears here, though.} 14. Qxd5+ {It gets worse. I lose a second pawn, and my knight is also under attack from his queen, as well as my king.} Nd6 {I manage to rescue my knight here, moving it onto my surviving bishop's path. Why didn't I do a similar move on move 4?} 15. dxe5 {I indeed lose my king's pawn as stated on move 12, and what's more, my knight is under attack.} Qc5 {I therefore attack his queen with mine...} 16. Qxc5 {...and he captures mine...} bxc5 {...and I capture his...} 17. exd6 {...but although my knight was unpinned, it falls victim to the pawn...} Bxd6 {...which is captured by my bishop. The pieces I have lost are have twice the total value as those I have captured, which shows that I was trying to be too clever in chasing the queen.} 18. Nc4 {He attacks my bishop with his knight, and I resign here. It really did serve me right for trying to be too clever.}
