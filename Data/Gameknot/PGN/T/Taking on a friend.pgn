1. e4 e5 2. f4 f6 {A bad move. Opens up the potential for Q-R5ch.} 3. Nh3 {I move my Knight to R3 to keep open the line for the Queen.} Bb4 4. Nc3 b6 {Haphazard. 2 16-year-olds with little skill, so...} 5. Bc4 Bb7 6. fxe5 fxe5 7. O-O {The threat is obvious... at least to me.} a5 {Not to my opponent. Now Q-R5 ch is coming.} 8. Qh5+ Ke7 9. d4 {Sacrificing a Pawn to open the line for B-N5ch.} exd4 10. Bg5+ Kd6 11. Bf4+ Ke7 12. Qe5+ Kf8 13. Bg5+ {Discoveries are always powerful...} Nf6 14. Rxf6+ gxf6 15. Bxf6 Qc8 16. Bxh8 {Winning back the sacrificed material.} dxc3 {This equalizes the material but allows a mate. Black's best hope was 16... B-Q2. If he can follow up with 17... Q-Q1, he'll at least have a couple of pieces he can use to help defend his exposed King.} 17. Qf6+ Ke8 18. Qf7+ Kd8 19. Bf6+ Be7 20. Bxe7# {I definitely exploited some major mistakes by my opponent, like not developing quickly and opening files where he was weak.}
