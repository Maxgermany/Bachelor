1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {A sharp variation of the French.} 4. Nge2 {A bit unusual perhaps, but this way if he captures...} Bxc3+ {...which he does...} 5. Nxc3 {...I still have a Knight guarding the KP.} Ne7 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. Bxd7+ {I get rid of his second Bishop, leaving me at an advantage if a two-minor-piece end game arises. } Nxd7 8. O-O O-O 9. e5 {Creating the "cramping Pawn chain", although with two minor pieces gone from each side there's less to cramp, and setting up a possible K-side attack.} c5 10. Be3 c4 {Seizing Q-side space in response, but leaving the P at QB4 may have been better: now my QP is no longer under pressure.} 11. f4 Nf5 12. Bd2 {I definitely don't want to give back the minor exchange.} a6 13. Ne2 {I begin to reassemble my forces towards the K-side.} b5 14. Bb4 {With the consideration that I don't want my B trapped behind my Pawn chain. Now it can participate in the coming attack.} Re8 15. Ng3 Nxg3 {This is a mistake, as it opens the KR file and lets my Rook have an avenue of attack.} 16. hxg3 a5 17. Bd6 {This Bishop is destined to play a key role on this diagonal.} a4 18. Kf2 Nb6 19. Rh1 {Moving a big gun into position.} Nc8 20. Bc5 Ne7 {Hastily rushing to the K-side to defend.} 21. Qh5 h6 22. g4 {Looking to batter down the obstructing Pawns.} f5 23. exf6 e.p. {This move breaks open my bro's defenses.} gxf6 24. Qxh6 {Threatening Q-R8 ch K-B2 R-R7 ch K-N3 Q-N7 mate.} Rf8 {Creating a flight square.} 25. Qh8+ {Carrying out the attack as planned.} Kf7 26. Rh7+ Ke8 {Forced. } 27. Qg7 {Threatening BxN forking Q and R, and if BxN QxB??? QxQ mate.} Rf7 {Desperation.} 28. Rh8+ {My brother resigned here. White has too many threats to defend against. If 28... K-Q2 29 RxQ ch followed by 30 QxR. If 28... N-N1 29 RxN ch, leaving Black the choice of 29... K-Q2 followed by previous variation, or 29... R-B1 30 RxR ch followed by 31 RxQ. If 28... R-B1 29 RxR ch followed by 30 RxQ.}
