[Opening "KGA (C33), bishop's gambit, Chigorin's attack"]

1. e4 {basic opening} e5 {allowing white to set up the gambit if he desires} 2. f4 {i do, obviously.} exf4 {and he accepts} 3. Bc4 {king's bishop is my poison} Qh4+ {i know people are gonna disagree but this move does nothing for black, at best it makes the game even, but usally white gains an advantage.} 4. Kf1 Nf6 {attacks the pawn} 5. Nf3 {attacks the queen and guards the pawn indirectly} Qg4 {not the place to put the queen, well now for a trap.} 6. Bxf7+ {he must allow me this pawn and walk away, if he takes the bishop the following happens} Kxf7 {here we go} 7. Ne5+ {fork of hell} Ke6 8. Nxg4 {this game is already very bad for black now just got to mate that king} b6 9. d3 {opening up lines for my (B)bishop} d5 {well developing was a better idea for you.} 10. e5 {ill just move it here and attack your knight} Kf5 {talk about a mobile king} 11. exf6 {thanks} gxf6 12. Nc3 {other knight comes out} Kg5 13. Nxd5 {the king is already in a corner almost} Bxg4 {nice, but not enough} 14. Qd2 Bc5 15. Qxf4+ {this check gave me 5 different mates i preset them all and left the game alone} Kh4 {this was the longest of the 5 so he picked the one giving me the most options for mistakes} 16. g3+ Kh3 {i liked h5 better it made him last longer and it gave me a way to mess up.} 17. Qh6+ {nothing left but to block needlessy with the bishop} Bh5 {i could be cute and mate with kf4 # but i went the traditional way instead.} 18. Qxh5# {a surprising game when he was higher rated then i was}
