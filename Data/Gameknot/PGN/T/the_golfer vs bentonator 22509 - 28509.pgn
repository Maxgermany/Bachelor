1. e4 {This is my fifth annotation. I hope you like it. As always (if you've read my previous annotations), the king's pawn advances two squares. It's the only thing I feel comfortable with as with many other people.} e5 {A common response.} 2. Qh5 {A move I used to pull a while ago, but learnt it is ineffective.} d6 {Opens up the bishop on c8 and defending e5 from my queen.} 3. Bc4 {I don't think checkmate will be achieved so easily...} Be6 {Knew it was coming. Forces my bishop to retreat.} 4. Bxe6 {I take it and look for another plan.} Qf6 5. Qh3 {Moving the queen to h3 was probably not the best move. Moving the bishop would have been better. I lost the bishop in this case (obviously). Not great play by me.} fxe6 6. Nf3 {Developing the centre of the board.} d5 {Attacking the undefended pawn.} 7. exd5 {Exchanging pawns.} exd5 8. Nc3 {Coming out for the attack, but a weak one.} d4 {Forcing the knight away.} 9. Nd5 {To a good place. If black is not careful, checkmate is near.} Qd6 {Unfortunately, he spotted it.} 10. Qc8+ {I go for it anyway.} Kf7 {Checking the king could lead him to a bad position, which is exactly what white does.} 11. Qxc7+ {Winning two pawns and checking the king.} Ke6 12. Qxb7 Qxd5 {Probably the best move, saving the rook, but both queens are lost if taken.} 13. Qb3 {Maybe not just yet. Still, I just lost a knight.} Na6 {Bringing the knight out. He becomes a key role later in the game.} 14. Ng5+ {Hoping for the king to eventually move away from the queen.} Kd6 15. Nf7+ {Bad move for black. Forked a rook and black has a piece disadvantage now.} Kc5 16. Nxh8 Qxg2 {I need to move the rook out fast, otherwise my work is lost.} 17. Rf1 Nb4 {Coming in for the forked rook attack. I need to prevent this.} 18. Rb1 Qe4+ {Getting the queen into a better position.} 19. Kd1 {My king is now trapped.} d3 {Closing in on a checkmate.} 20. cxd3 Nxd3 {The rook on b2 has to be careful now.} 21. Qxg8 {Winning a knight and using black's piece disadvantage to my advantage.} h6 {Black could have made more use of their good position.} 22. Qb3 {So taking the opportunity, I move back to my starting position.} Bd6 {Trapping my knight into a corner.} 23. Nf7 {The knight's quick escape.} Bc7 {Black still not attacking as such.} 24. f3 {Attacking the queen and trying to fend it away from the knight.} Qc4 {Maybe not.} 25. Qxc4+ {To make the game more interesting.} Kxc4 26. b3+ {A baseless move. Black's king shouldn't be so far down the board anyway.} Kb4 {Freeing up the bishop and the king. Slowly.} 27. Bb2 Rf8 {Attacking the knight?} 28. Bc3+ Kc5 {Shoving the king back to make way for pawns.} 29. Nxe5 {The only safe way for my knight and taking a pawn at the same time.} Bxe5 30. Bxe5 Nxe5 {My lead decreases as my opponent wins a knight.} 31. Rc1+ {Slowly making the king back away.} Kd4 {But he has other ideas.} 32. f4 {Attacking the knight with a pawn.} Nd3 {Attacking the rook on c1 and the pawn on f4.} 33. Rc4+ {Putting the king in his place.} Kd5 {Slowly backing away.} 34. Kc2 {Attacking the knight. It's been in the way for quite some time.} Nc5 35. d4 {Pushing the knight further away.} Ne4 {Finds a way back in.} 36. Kd3 {Another attempt at pushing.} g5 {Trying to win the pawn on f4.} 37. f5 {Blocked.} g4 {But black is trying to promote their own pawns.} 38. Re1 {Still trying to win the knight.} Re8 {So the rook defends.} 39. a4 {Not aiming very high.} Nd6 {A clever move by black? Certainly not!} 40. Rc5# {Trapping the king in and losing the game. Thanks bentonator for a good game. There were a few sloppy moves from each side, but we're learning and getting better (hopefully!).}
