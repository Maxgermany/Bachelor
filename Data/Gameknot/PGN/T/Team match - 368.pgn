1. d4 {This is the second game which kartal_ist timed out in. He played the queens gambit. I have rarely ever faced a queens gambit player in gameknot but in the tournaments  I play there're a lot.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 {I was trying to angle towards a Meran or a Noteboom.} e6 4. e3 {I think Nf3 was better but e3 is fine.} Nf6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6. Be2 {Normal is Bd3 attacking h7 but this is fine too.} dxc4 {WHite has lost tempo taking 2 moves to reach c4.} 7. Bxc4 b5 {And this gains a tempo by attacking the bishop while allowing my  bad LSB to be developed.} 8. Bb3 {Usually Nd3 is played but this is alright.} Bb7 9. O-O Be7 {I would be aiming for a6 followed by c5 trying to open up the diagonal for my LSB while trying to break up the centre. White would be trying to play followed by e5 or d5.}
