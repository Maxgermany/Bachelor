1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 {King's pawn, Patzer Opening.  Unusual.} Nf6 {Black generally does better with Nc6. } 3. Qxe5+ Be7 4. Qf4 d5 5. d3 Bg4 6. h3 Bh5 7. g4 Bg6 8. Be2 O-O 9. e5 Nfd7 10. h4 Nc6 {Ph5 traps black's white bishop.  Ph6 makes room for it.} 11. h5 Bg5 {Well played count threat.  This picks up white's black bishop.  Nice trade.  New note:  Sonata296 points out QxBg5 is even better--white gets a free bishop.} 12. Qh2 Ncxe5 {BxBc1 was almost certainly better.} 13. f4 {Nice pawn fork.} Nxg4 14. Bxg4 Nc5 15. fxg5 {Mm, I think I prefer PxBg6.  Black must then respond to QxPh7#.} f5 16. hxg6 hxg6 17. Qh8+ {I would not do this.  Black threatens the white bishop (PxBg4).  Pushing the king to Kf7 permits black to play Rh8, so white loses Rh1.} Kf7 18. Qh3 fxg4 19. Qxg4 Re8+ 20. Kd1 Ne6 21. b4 b5 22. Nf3 d4 23. Ne5+ Ke7 24. Nxg6+ Kf7 25. Qf5+ Kg8 26. Rh8# {}
