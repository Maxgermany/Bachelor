1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 {The Exchange Slav } cxd5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bf4 a6 7. e3 {All standard opening theory } Bg4 {Aimed at reducing white's control of e5. } 8. Rc1 {Developing the rook so that it may eventually control the c-file. } e6 9. h3 {Forcing the bishop to either retreat or take the knight. } Bxf3 {I decide to take the knight because it decreases white's control of e5. } 10. Qxf3 Bd6 {Exchanging the active white bishop for black's inactive. } 11. Bd3 {This develops a piece but allows me an interesting combination. } Bxf4 {First I capture the darksquared bishop. } 12. Qxf4 {exf4 not only ruins white's pawn structure but also hangs the d-pawn. } Qb6 {Attacking the b-pawn which is fairly difficult for white to guard. } 13. O-O {Alternative variation: 13. b3 Rc8 (13... Nb4 14. Be2 Rc8 [This position just can't be great for white unless he finds some really good way to get a piece on c5.]) Alternative variation: 13. Rb1 Nb4 14. Be2 Nc2+ 15. Kf1 Rc8 [ The uncoordination of white's pieces means a very comfortable position and advantage for black.] } Qxb2 {After several minutes of calculation I decide that it is safe to take the pawn because Rb1 is impossible and Qd6 can be met by Qb4. } 14. Na4 {Kicking the queen and bringing the knight to c5. } Qa3 {I was worried about Qxa2 losing the queen but I think I may have been okay after Ra1 Qb3 and I will be able to retreat my queen. Even if white wins back both pawns on the queenside the position is equal and as this play is nearly 200 points higher than me a draw is a very respectable result. Alternative variation: 14... Qxa2 15. Ra1 Qb3 16. Nc5 Qb6 17. Rfb1 Qd8 18. Rxb7 O-O 19. Bxa6 Nb8 } 15. Nc5 O-O {Bringing my king to safety. } 16. Nxb7 Qxd3 17. Rxc6 {White has won the pawn back but I think I have a nice position. } Qb5 {I miss the move Qc7 which puts a lot of pressure on me because white's pieces are penetrating my position. Rfc8 is much better. Alternative variation: 17... Rfc8 18. Rfc1 (18. Rc7 Rxc7 19. Qxc7 Qa3 [Although black's rook is not ideally placed he should win the a2 pawn and would be doing just fine.] 20. Rc1 h6) 18... Rxc6 19. Rxc6 Qb1+ [And now black wins a free piece.] } 18. Qc7 Qa4 {Threatening a2. } 19. Rc2 Ra7 {Creating threats of a move like Rxb7 and then Qxc2. However, I think white is better here because all of black's pieces are badly placed. } 20. Rb2 Qa3 21. Qb6 Raa8 {The only move to safe my rook. } 22. Qb3 {I think Nc5 is so much better because then my queen has a little bit of trouble getting back into the game. } Qxb3 23. axb3 {Rxb3 can be met by Ne4 with all kinds of threats with Nd2. Alternative variation: 23. Rxb3 Ne4 24. Rb2 Rfc8 $11 } Rfb8 {Bringing my rook to attack the bpawn. If I can eliminate the bpawn, then the game is an easy draw. } 24. Nc5 a5 {Threatening a4 and preventing b4 which would keep the pawn stuck on a square where the white knight is always attacking it. } 25. Ra1 {Pressuring the a pawn.  } Ne4 {Excellent move because the only way I can win the white pawn is to get rid of the knight. } 26. Nxe4 {Rba2 is met by Rb5. Alternative variation: 26. Rba2 Rb5 27. b4 Rxb4 28. Rxa5 Rxa5 29. Rxa5 Kf8 30. Nxe4 dxe4 31. Re5 Rb1+ 32. Kh2 Rb6 33. Rxe4 f6 34. Rh4 Kg8 } dxe4 {Black has a worse pawn structure but still the position is completely drawn. } 27. Rba2 Rxb3 28. Ra2xa5 Rxa5 29. Rxa5 Rb1+ {I push the king to the side of the board. } 30. Kh2 f6 {Preventing Re5. } 31. Ra7 {Cutting off my king on the seventh rank. } Rb5 {I want to play e5 to undouble my pawns. } 32. Re7 {Attacking the pawn. } Rb6 {Defending it. } 33. Kg3 Kf8 {Getting rid of the rook. } 34. Rc7 Rb5 35. Rc5 Rb2 {Rxc5 leads to a loss after dxc5 Ke7 Kf4 Kd7 Kxe4 Kc6 Kc4. } 36. f3 exf3 {I take the opportunity to get rid of my doubled pawns. } 37. gxf3 Rd2 {I bring the rook behind the dpawn so neither it nor the epawn can advance. } 38. h4 {After this move the game was agreed drawn. }
