1. Nf3 {The King's Indian Attack... not the 1. e4 or the 1. d4 I'm familiar with.} Nc6 {Offering white 2. e4 if he wants it.} 2. c4 e5 {Staking a claim to the center.} 3. b3 {Not developing the kingside... this move seems very commital to fianchettoing the bishop to me.} Bc5 {So, I reason, might as well develop my kingside and attack towards his.} 4. e3 {I expected Bb2.} e4 {Threatening to win a pawn with 5. Nd4 Nxd4 6. exd4 Bxd4.} 5. d4 {The only way to keep material equality without retreating the knight to g1.} Bb4+ 6. Nfd2 {The knight is forced to a bad square.  Black is ahead in development, but white controls more space on the queenside.} Nf6 {Furthering development, but I overlooked...} 7. a3 {!  This good move forces black to retreat his dark squared bishop, and breaks the pin on the knight.  Now, black must take care not to lose his distant e4 pawn.} Be7 8. Nc3 d5 {?!  Seems like the natural way to defend the e4 pawn, but black will lose a pawn anyway.} 9. cxd5 Nxd5 10. Ncxe4 {So, down a pawn, black must take advantage of his edge in development and the fact that his pieces are more mobile.} f5 {...not that this is necessarily the best way to do that, but I'm thinking of attacking on the kingside.  So, since after castling, black will have a rook on f8, it makes sense to throw open some room for the rook.} 11. Nc5 {Ng3 may also be worth considering here, for defensive purposes, and also since after b6, the knight will be booted out of c5.} O-O 12. Bc4 {Nasty pin on the black knight.} Kh8 {I have to break it, otherwise the threat of g4 followed by e4 wins the knight.} 13. O-O {?!  This is definitely what they call "castling into it".  White may be safer in the center.} b6 {<boot>} 14. Na4 Bf6 {Building up pressure on d4.} 15. Bxd5 {?!  This was white's best piece!  Why give black so much activity in the center?} Qxd5 16. Nc3 {Forcing the queen out of the center.} Qf7 {White's kingside is looking less and less safe.} 17. b4 {White still hasn't developed his Bc1, which I thought would've happened back on the 4th move!  While queenside expansion is a decent plan, white should be developing his pieces instead!} Bb7 18. f4 {?  Oh no!  This definitely loses.  There are too many pins and pitfalls for white in this position to play such a weakening move!  Thus, the carnage begins...} Nxd4 {Where exd3 is met by Bxd4 , winning back the knight with advantage.} 19. Bb2 {Finally developing the bishop, but it's way too late.} Qg6 {Threatening mate on g2.} 20. Rf2 {The only other defense was g3.} Bh4 {...trying to provoke g3!  Why?  Twofold... because Bxg3 hxg3 Qxg3  is quite a menace, and because Qc6 leads to a devastating mate threat on h1.  I'll have my choice if he plays it...} 21. Nf3 {Not taking the bait.  But this gives black the exchange, without abatement of the attack.} Bxf2+ 22. Kxf2 Nxf3 23. gxf3 {White's kingside is in shambles.} Rad8 {Hitting the queen...} 24. Qe2 Qh5 {The queen is tied to the defense of f3...} 25. Kg2 {So the king must guard h2.} Rf6 {the deflection Rd2 was tempting, but too rash and unsound, I felt.} 26. e4 Rfd6 {But now, with doubled rooks, this is a real threat.} 27. Rd1 Rd6xd1 28. Nxd1 fxe4 {...and white cannot recapture.} 29. Kg3 exf3 {... and white cannot recapture...} 30. Qe7 {Desperation.  At this point, I took a long think, and saw the line 30. Qe7 Qg6  31. Kh4 Rg8 32. Qxc7 h5 33. Nf2 Bc8 34. Qxa7 Qg2 35. Kxh5 Qxh2  36. Kg6 Qh6  37. Kf7 Qe6#, which is not forced, but shows that despite white's best efforts, black has a very won game.  } Qg6+ 31. Kh4 Rg8 {White has no threats left.} 32. Qxc7 h5 {!  Threatening mate on g4.} 33. Qd7 {??  Ne3 or Nf2 were much better tries at defense.  Now, white loses his queen.} Bc8 34. Bxg7+ {Attempting to complicate, but black plays accurately here.} Kh7 35. Bf6+ {There is no way to save the queen.} Bxd7 36. Bg5 Qc2 {threatening mate on h2.  The game is over now.} 37. Kg3 Qg2+ {White will play 38. Kh4, followed by (black's choice) mate on h2, h3, or g4.  At this point, my opponent allowed his clock to run out.  Annoying, yes, but a win is a win.}
