1. d4 {I've been toying with this opening for a good six months now and it has yielded some good results so far. When I get back to England I will try it OTB and see how I get on.} Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 {I don't have to worry about the bishop to C5} 3. Bf4 b6 4. e3 Bb7 5. Nbd2 Be7 6. Bd3 h5 {H5 I haven't seen this before so early in the game. I guess my opponent will castle long} 7. h3 {I prepare a hole for my bishop, I am not in the mood to exchange today} d6 {Black takes away the e5 square but am happy with my development} 8. c3 Nbd7 9. Qc2 Nd5 {I thought he might have played that earlier} 10. Bg3 g5 {mmm, lets put the King away} 11. O-O-O Rg8 {Black is going for it} 12. Kb1 Nd7f6 13. c4 {Now life is going to get interesting} Nb4 14. Qa4+ {Black is going to lose a piece} Nc6 15. d5 exd5 16. cxd5 Nxd5 17. Nd4 Ndb4 18. Bb5 Kf8 19. Nxc6 Bxc6 20. Bxc6 Nxc6 21. Qxc6 {White stands better} Rg6 22. Nb3 Rb8 23. Nd4 a6 24. Qf3 {The knight is proving to be a real pain} Qe8 25. Qxh5 {White gets the pawn so is now a whole piece to the good} Bf6 26. Qf3 b5 27. h4 g4 28. Qf5 {White now has a passed pawn to add to blacks' worries} Bxd4 29. Rxd4 Qc8 {Trading queens is ok but I have a better move} 30. Qc2 Qb7 31. Rc1 {Black resigns the position is hopeless}
