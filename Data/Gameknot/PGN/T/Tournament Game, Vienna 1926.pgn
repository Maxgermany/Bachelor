1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. exd5 {This variation frees Black's game and is therefore usually not adopted. However, with Spielmann sitting at the board...} exd5 5. Bg5 Be7 {Unpinning and clearing the way to castle.} 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. Nge2 Nb4 {If anything, it is Wahle's position that looks more aggressive.} 8. Ng3 Nxd3+ {Removing the KB, usually a vital piece for White in a French Defense attack. } 9. Qxd3 {Centralizing his Q with the recapture. } g6 {This may well be the losing move! It severely weakens the K-side, especially the black squares.} 10. O-O c6 11. Rae1 {Spielmann begins concentrating his forces on the K-side.} O-O {If Black had not played 9 P-KN3?? this would secure the King behind a solid defensive wall.} 12. Rxe7 {To create a pin.} Qxe7 {Forced. Now the Knight is not only pinned, but it lacks Pawn protection thanks to 9 P-KN3??} 13. Qf3 {Applying more pressure to the pinned and helpless Knight.} Kg7 {The only move to avoid losing the piece.} 14. Nce4 {Tightening the screws.} dxe4 {Black has no choice.} 15. Nxe4 {The Knight must fall, as it cannot be guarded a 3rd time. 15... QxN? falls to 16 QxN ch! K-N1 17 B-R6!} Qe6 {The Queen must stay near the action.} 16. Bxf6+ {Forcing the King back.} Kg8 {Black's game, like an archaeologist's career, is in ruins. If 16... K-R3, 17 Q-B4 ch and mate in 1.} 17. Qf4 {Black resigns, as he has no good way to stop 18 Q-R6.}
