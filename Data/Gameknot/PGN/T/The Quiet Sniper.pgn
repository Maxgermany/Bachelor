1. e4 {Hello Everyone, here's a game I played on ICC the other day, and I was pretty happy with the way the game went, and comments would be appreciated.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Re1 Nf6 7. d3 {? I wasn't quite sure what his plan was, since the main line is d4.} d6 {I played d6 here to free up my knight from the defense of the e-pawn. The idea is that in one moment I can play b5 then Na5 and win the LSB as seen in the game} 8. Nc3 b5 9. Bb3 Na5 10. Nd5 {Interestingly, white could have played d4 here to regain the pawn} Nxb3 {I deprive white of the valuable bishop pair, while also slightly impairing his Queenside Structure.} 11. Nxf6+ Qxf6 12. axb3 h6 {Preventing Bg5, I thought this was a little passive, but It was okay.} 13. Bd2 Be7 14. Bc3 Bb7 {Eying the f3 knight. This Bishop proved to be very valuable, hence the name "The Quiet Sniper"} 15. Nd2 {He moves the knight away, and that gives me the opening I need.} h5 {At the time, I was thinking there was potential for Rh6, then Bxg2 Ideas. The attack turned out to be so much more...} 16. Ne4 {Trying to centralize his knight, and block off my bishop, but this just gave me an excuse to improve my Queens position.} Qg6 {The threat here is f5 Ng3 and then h4, winning the knight. The knight cannot move from there because then Qxg2#} 17. f3 {Blunting my LSB's scope} f5 {Kicking the knight, and preparing for an assault of white's kingside.} 18. Nf2 h4 {! maybe the best move I played in the game} 19. d4 h3 20. g3 Bh4 {! Exploiting the pin along the g-file. The attack has turned into so much more than I calculated.} 21. dxe5 {??? Ignoring the threat of Bxg3} Bxg3 {As planned} 22. exd6+ {A nothing in between check} Kf8 23. hxg3 {?? Instantly losing. A better try may have been 23. Kf1 Bxd6 24. Re3 [Giving the king the e1 square] Bxh2 with black doing much better} Qxg3+ {Bring my Queen into enemy territory and drive his king into the center. Kh1 cannot be played due to Qg2#} 24. Kf1 {Forced} Qg2+ {Driving his king into the center, and setting him up for a nasty skewer.} 25. Ke2 Bxf3+ {BAM! White Resigns.The Quiet Sniper strikes! The LSB who sat on the edge of the board watching carefully comes in to win white's Queen just like that. I was pretty proud of this game since I had been trying to attempt to play more aggressively lately and it worked out here. I hope you enjoyed the game!}
