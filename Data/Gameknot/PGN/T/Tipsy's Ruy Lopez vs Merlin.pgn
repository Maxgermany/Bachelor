[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C69), exchange, Bronstein variation"]

1. e4 {By common agreement we are playing the Ruy Lopez, which makes the next couple of moves mandatory...} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {With this move we enter into the Ruy Lopez. Black has a number of options here, though by far the most common continuation is (as indeed played in the game) 3...a6. Apart from that, Black may opt for 3...Nf6 (Berlin Defence), 3...f5 (Jaenitsch Gambit / Schliemann Defence), 3...d6 (Steinitz Defence), 3...Bc5 (Cordel Variation), 3...Nd4 (Bird Defence). Either of these are emininently playable, though only the Berlin Defence currently enjoys any real popularity.} a6 {The Murphy Defence, forcing an immediate declaration from White: will you exchange, or do you retreat?} 4. Bxc6 {White opts for the Exchange Variation. For a long time thought to be completely harmless for Black, until Bobby Fischer turned it into a dangerous weapon in the 1960s. White has a slight lead in development and a superior pawn structure. Recapturing with the d-pawn opens lines for both queen and bishop, significantly lessening the impact of White's development. In principle, Black should at least consider a recapture with the b-pawn, as the general rule for pawn capture is "always capture towards the center". But though correct in its general principle, capturing with the b-pawn is hardly recommendable in this specific position. For instance, 4...bxc6 5.O-O d6 6.d4 exd4 7.Qxd4 c5 8.Qd3 and Black's pawn formation is stymied, his development non-existent, and his position close to untenable.} dxc6 {The proffered sacrifice of the e5 pawn is purely illusory. On 5.Nxe4? Black has two forceful replies: 5...Qg5 and 5...Qd4. Either will affort Black a superior position, eg.: 5.Nxe5? Qd4 6.Nf3 Qxe4+ 7.Qe2 Qxe2+ 8.Kxe2 Bg4 9.Re1 O-O-O 10.Kf1 Bxf3 11.gxf3 Bd6 -+. In the game position, the current main move - and White's most flexible choice - is 5.0-0. Before the days of Bobby Fischer the most common continuation was 5.d4, which offers a considerable simplification of the position.} 5. O-O {White has castled and his position is sound if not very threatening. Black, on the other hand, has lost the only developed piece he had (Nc6) so that all of his officers are now still on the back rank. However, his position is not so bad as all that, as he does have the half-open d-file and open lines for his bishops and Queen. What he needs now, more than anything else, is to keep the position reasonably closed while getting his king whisked away to safety - and he needs to protect his e-pawn too while doing it. There are various ways of achieving this, including the unpretentious 5...f6, and the more spectacular but ultimately dubious 5...Bg4 6.h3 h5!?} Qd6 {Before the days of computer-assisted opening analysis this move would be regarded as ugly, premature, foolhardy, and a waste of time. Today, it is one of the main lines in the Spanish Exchange Variation - though still regarded as ugly. Its redeeming features make up for its unsightliness however: it keeps up pressure on the d-file, vacates the back row in preparation for castling long, opens up for the possibility of transferring the queen to the king-side in preparation for a K-side attack on White's position, and it supports the pawn on e5. A measure of the strength of this move is that White cannot just wrench open the position by 6.d4; Black is fine after 6...exd4 7.Qxd4 Qxd4 8.Nxd4 Bd7.} 6. Na3 {Planning to harass Black's queen while preserving the option of opening the center quickly and efficiently by means of d2-d4. Black considered various options here, including 6...Qe6 and 6...b5. Of these, he evaluated the pawn move as clearly the stronger, as it would both restrict the mobility of White's night and expand his control of q-side space. Additionally, 6...Qe6 would place both queen and king on the e-file, at a time when opening this file would indeed seem to be a possible, tactical resource for White. Still, 6...Qe6 is playable, as demonstrated by Romanishin in his rather nice win against Fiorido: 6...Qe6 7.d4 exd4 8.Nxd4 Qf6 9.Re1 Bd7 10.e5 Qg6 11.e6 fxe6 12.Nc4 O-O-O 13.Bf4 c5 14.Nf3 Bc6 15.Qe2 Qf5 16.Qe3 Nf6 17.Nfe5 Nd5 18.Qa3 Qxf4 19.Nxc6 Qxc4 20.Nxd8 Kxd8 21.Rad1 Bd6 22.Qh3 Nf6 23.b3 Qg4 24.Qe3 Qh5 25.h3 Re8 26.Qd3 Kc8 27.Rd2 e5 28.Rde2 e4 29.Qc3 Qg5 30.Qe3 Qe5 31.g3 Qh5 32.Kg2 Nd5 33.Qd2 Qf3+ 34.Kg1 e3 35.fxe3 Qxg3+ 36.Rg2 Qe5 37.e4 Nf4 38.Rh2 Ng6 39.Rhe2 Nf4 40.Rh2 g5 41.c4 Nd3 {0-1 Fiorido, G. (2127) - Romanishin, O. (2511) / 3. Forni di Sopra Open, ITA 2012.} b5 {Black gains space on the queenside and White will have to spend additional tempi if he is to activate his knight on a3. Still, this does little to allay the fundamental challenge in Black's position: his precariously placed king. Indeed, in some respects the pawn move actually enhances the danger to Black's king: he can no longer rely on castling long, which means that White may gain dangerous pressure on his position once the center pawn on e5 has been exchanged. The straightaway advance to d4 is not that dangerous however, as Black is fine once the queens have been exchanged off the board: 7.d4 exd4 8.Nxd4 c5 9.Nf3 Qxd1 10.Rxd1 Be6.} 7. c3 {The logical, maybe even necessary move, freeing up c2 for the knight while adding weight to the eventual d4 advance. But there are problems as well: first and foremost, the c-pawn advance to c3 leaves the d-pawn backwards and creates a gaping weakness on d3. This in itself is quite enough to cast the whole Na3 variation into doubt, in my mind. The more so as Black has a splendid rejoinder available...} c5 {The logical response. Advancing the d-pawn to d4 will now gain White nothing, while Black stands to get rid of his doubled c-pawn weakness. Meanwhile, the center is still closed, which means Black is not unduly bothered by not having had a chance to castle his King yet. Or, stated another way: the closed position negates any significant advantage that White might otherwise have stood to gain from his greater development, while Black has achieved already a marked positional advantage by means of the half-open d-file, pressure against White's weaknesses on d2 and d3, and his significantly greater mobility on both Q-side and K-side. In a very real sense, initiative has now shifted to Black; White just hasn't discovered it yet. On 8.d4 Black will reply 8...cxd4 9.cxd4 exd4 10.Nxd4 c5 after which his mobile Q-side majority gives him the better chances.} 8. Nc2 {Sticking to the planned d4-advance - which would, if Black allowed it, actually equalize the game. However ...} c4 {And White is stuck! The d-pawn stays put, the weakness on d3 is now glaringly obvious, and the doubled c-pawn actually serves to reinforce Black's Q-side control. White's position is seriously cramped and his pieces have little mobility to speak of. Meanwhile, the center remains closed and Black has no worries about the safety of his King.} 9. b3 {Gives White a little more space while pressuring the c4 pawn.} Be6 {Reinforces c4 while developing a piece. White gains control of the b-file after 10.bxc4 bxc4 11.Rb2, but it is hardly useful for him: he cannot hope to equalize unless he can neutralize the weakness on d3.} 10. Ba3 {Though rather obvious, I tend to regard this move as being a slight error: it merely serves to prompt Black into a response he would like to do anyway, which means it is likely a loss of time. On the other hand, the bishop does need to get moved off the 1st rank, and it is hardly better placed on b2. Possibly 10.Qe2 is the better move.} c5 {Very strong. Black reinforces his control of d4 while effective blocking off the bishop diagonal and wrestling b4 away from the knight. The doubled c-pawns are now revealed as a significant strength rather than a weakness.} 11. Ne3 {Forces the ensuing exchange, as 11...Nf6 12.bxc4 bxc4 13.Qa4+ Ke7 14.Nxc4 Bxc4 15.Qxc4 leaves White with a clear advantage.} cxb3 {White has removed the cramp on c4 and gains a mobile pawn flank on the Q-side. The fundamental weakness on d3 still exists however.} 12. axb3 {A key position in the game. Black has almost regained parity in development, and anyhow the position is still closed to a significant degree, so White's lead in development matters little. What does matter is White's weakness on d3 and his relative lack of space (mobility). All of which will disappear in a moment, unless Black can somehow block the threatened d2-d4 advance.} Qd3 {And there it is! The Queen serves to physically restrain the pawn from advancing, while at the same time forcing White to reply to the threatened capture on e4. The obvious reply, 13.Qc2, fails due to 13...Qxc2 14.Nxc2 Bxb3.} 13. Ng5 {Quite good. Black either has to move his bishop off the b3 diagonal (thus solving a significant problem for White) or accept being saddled with yet another, doubled pawn - and an isolated one at that. However, as we have already seen, doubled pawns are not always a weakness - and in this case it will serve to give Black an almost immutable lock on the center.} Nf6 {Developing with added pressure on e4. This will serve as adequate replacment for the soon-to-be-gone bishop.} 14. Nxe6 {Virtually forced, or White will have achieved nothing.} fxe6 {And we have the doubled pawns - again. This time the effect is possibly even stronger: though isolated and thus - in principle! - quite weak, they are actually a close to deciding feature on the board, affording Black a virtually unbreakable hold on the center and effectively neutering White's knight on e3.} 15. f3 {The only way of protecting e4. Unfortunately, this also creates an additional weakness as it opens the diagonal onto the White King. Black now needs to find a way to continue the pressure, noting that an immediate 15...b4 avails him not at all after 16.Bb2.} Be7 {A necessary move, as Black needs to castle and activate his rooks. But nonetheless, this affords White a breathing pause and thus a chance to reorganize his pieces. It is difficult to find anything better though; settling the bishop on d6 would prevent the Queen from retreating at need.} 16. Bb2 {A rather defensive-looking move, but with teeth: White vacates the a-file for his rook, which means Black's rook on a8 is now severely limited in its mobility, and prepares for an eventual c3-c4 advance with a discovered threat against Black's e5.} O-O {The pawn on e5 is not seriously threatened yet, and Black needs both his rooks in offensive roles.} 17. c4 {As Black needs to remobilize his knight on f6 anyway, this is hardly an embarrasment for him.} Nd7 {Aiming the knight - once it has fulfilled its defensive duty towards e5 - against the weaknesses on b4 and d4.} 18. Ra2 {White prepares to add pressure against the backwards pawn on a6 (alternatively, to defend against a breakthrough on the Q-side). But before any such pressures can be brought to bear, he will have to find a more permanent solution to his center weaknesses.} Qd6 {The pawn on d2 is locked solid; it can advance to d3 and no further. Retracting the Queen will allow Black to remobilize the knight and add more pressure on White's creaking formations. On 19.cxb5 Black gains a clear advantage after 19...axb5 20.Qa1 Rxa2 21.Qxa2 Qxd2.} 19. Ra5 {It's difficult to White to find a plan forward, so he settles for locking down the Q-side as much as possible.} b4 {Black wants to keep pressure on the d-file, so this makes more sense than trying to reinforce b5. White may, in this position, want to keep pressure on the a-file in turn, in which case Black will have to be precise: 20.Qa1 Bd8! with the idea 21.Ra2 Bc7 and White can no longer prevent Black from relocating his knight: Nd7-b8-c6-d4, as Black may (if required) advance a6-a5 and thus keep his a-pawn covered. An important point in the board postion here - and the reason why Black has to play precisely - is that he does **not** want to open the d-file prematurely. After 20.Qa1 Qxd2?! 21.Ng4 Qc2 22.Qa2 Bd8 23.Bxe5 Qxa2 24.Rxa2 White has equalized and may even have a slight advantage. While 20.Qa1 Bd8 21.Ra2 Qxd2? 22.Bc1! Qd4 23.Qb1 Qd6 24.Rd1 actually hands the d-file -and the advantage - over to White completely!} 20. d3 {This however, is entirely too passive. White would be better off going for the more exacting 20.Qa1 (as detailed in the comment to 19...b4). Likely he underestimated the effect of the ensuing knight maneuvre.} Nb8 {Black needs to activate the knight. On d7 it is entirely passive, besides blocking up the valuable d-file. White's best play here is probably to do the same: Ne3-g4-f2, and Black is left with a very difficult task trying to break through, seeing as how White seems able to block the Q-side advance by the simple (though expensive) expedient of placing his rook on a4.} 21. Qe2 {As an alternative to the g4-f2 knight maneuver, White is now able to perform the same relocation by means of d1. The game move has the added advantage of moving the White queen off the d-file and giving room for the rook to take its place there.} Nc6 {The knight is well placed here, and far more active than it was on d7. White should now retreat 22.Ra4, in order to block Black's Q-side ambitions, after which 22...Bd8 would probably be imprecise as Black cannot hope to break through on the Q-side while that rook is on a4, which means the bishop is likely to prove of better use on the K-side after all.} 22. Raa1 {The rook retreats too far. It would be better placed on a2 (where it would help cover the 2nd rank and offer the prospect of working together with the rook on f1 in quickly and decisively seizing control of any open file that may present itself), and far better placed on a4.} a5 {It is clear for Black that any hopes he may have of winning the game is and must be closely linked with a breakthrough on the Q-side. It is thus important to advance those pawns as far as possible, so that the eventual Q-side breakthrough (or even the threat of one) will prove decisive. Thus for instance an immediate 23.Qc2, aiming to block any further advance of the pawn, may now be countered by the interesting - and probably decisive - pawn sacrifice 23...a4! 24.bxa4 Rfd8, after which 25.Rfd1 Nd4 26.Bxd4 Qxd4 27.Qf2 b3 should win for Black.} 23. g3 {White correctly perceives that any active counterplay must happen on the K-side, but there is little hope of this advance ever bearing fruit. Black is too well poised in the center for a counterattack on the flank to have any perceivable chance of success.} Bg5 {Preparing to take advantage of the open lines in White's camp while blocking any ideas White may have about advancing the f-pawn. Now interesting complications arise after 24.Ng4 Nd4, on which 25.Qd1 h5 26.Nf2 Nxf3+ 27.Kg2 where the sharp rejoinder 27...Nd2!? is probably premature due to 28.Re1 Rf3 29.Qxf3!? Nxf3 30.Kxf3 with an unclear position. Black is ahead on points but may find it very difficult to break through. Less good for White is 25.Bxd4?! Qxd4+ 26.Qf2 Qxd3 27.Qxc5 Rxf3 28.Rxf3 Qxf3 and White's position is in shambles.} 24. Ng2 {Prudent. The knight is an important defender and control of e3 is vital for White.} Nd4 {White's 23rd move (g3) now looks like serious mistake; rather than vitalizing White's K-side, it now reveals itself as a near-fatal weakening of the important pawn on f3. If that pawn could advance, the weakness may have been turned to a strength ... but it can't. And because it can't escape the pressure being levelled against it, it threatens to bring the whole edifice crashing down round White's king. Black's knight, magnificantly poised on d4, commands the whole board. The threat against b3 has to be replied to, and retreating the queen to d1 to cover it is inadvisable as Black can simply pile up pressure on the f-file until something gives, eg.: 25.Qd1 Rf7 26.f4 Raf8 27.fxg5 Rxf1+ 28.Qxf1 Rxf1+ 29.Rxf1 Nxb3 and Black wins.} 25. Bxd4 {Thus, White is compelled to this exchange} Qxd4+ {A forcing move. White cannot move the King away, as 26.Kh1 Rfd8 27.Rfd1 Qc3 28.Rab1 a4! 29.bxa4 Rxa4 gives Black the Q-side breakthrough he needs to win. Additionally, White cannot block with the rook: 26.Rf2 Rfd8 27.Rd1 a4 28.f4 a3! is a clear win for Black (29.fxg5 a2 etc.).} 26. Qf2 {Black has succeeded in denuding d3 of defenders, but he cannot take immediate advantage of that: capturing the pawn now would be premature, as 26...Qxd3 allows 27.Qxc5! with complications, eg.: 27...Qxb3 28.Qxe5 Be3+ 29.Nxe3 Qxe3+ 30.Kh1 Qb6 (Black must cover the pawn on e6 or hand the center over to White entirely) 31.Rfd1 and White has counterplay though Black is still better.} Qxf2+ {The 'intuitive' reply here would be to recapture with the rook. It would also be ... wrong. White needs to capture with the King here, even if it does place the king in an exposed position, entering a half-open center and looking down the throat of a hostile rook with only a weak pawn as shield. But if he doesn't - if he captures with the rook instead - his monarch is going to turn out to be too far away from the Q-side pawns to be able to avert the disaster looming there. Only by capturing with his king, getting that one, vital step closer to the front, can he equalize the game now. Let's look at some lines: 27.Kxf2! Rf7 28.Ra4 Raf8 29.Ke2 (29.Ne1 Bd2!) 29...Bd8 and White has equalized. Or 27...Bd2!? 28.Ke2! Bc3 29.Ra4 and Black cannot break through (and likewise, any attempt by White to open the center will free Black's bishop to range the board again). That said, this line actually does represent Black's best attempt at a win, as White has to play rather exactly to ensure equality. For instance 28.Ra2?! Bc3 29.Ke2 a4 30.bxa4 Ra5 31.Kd1 Rfa8 32.Kc2 Rxa4 33.Rxa4 Rxa4 and Black has a clear advantage. Or 28.Ne3 Bc3 29.Ra2 a4 30.bxa4 Ra5 31.Nd1 Bd4+ 32.Ke2 Rfa8 33.Nb2 Bxb2 34.Rxb2 Rxa4 and Black should win.} 27. Rxf2 {On first blush this has several advantages on the king capture: it prepares for a doubling of the rooks on either the a- or f-file, and it enhances the collective mobility of the rooks. True, there is a potential weakness insofar as the king and the rook are now on the same diagonal, but the knight on g2 serves well to guard against Black placing his bishop on e3 to fork the rook. The actual problem with 27.Rxf2 is less obvious - as detailed in the previous annotation: the king remains on the g-file and without influence on the central and Q-side scenes.} Rfd8 {Black takes immediate advantage. The bishop on g5 prevents the f2 rook from entering the defence of the weak pawn on d3, and the rook on a1 cannot move away from the a-file or Black will break through with an immediate a5-a4. And the knight, of course, cannot move either, or Black will win the exchange by means of Bg4-e3.} 28. f4 {White has prepared for those problems however, and after this advance everything seems fine. More than fine actually, as White gains both initiative and a slight advantage after 28...exf4 29.gxf4 Bh6 30.Rf3: any activity Black may wish to initiate on the Q-side is easily neutralized by a thrust by White's, now very mobile e- and f-pawns.} Bf6 {Unfortunately for White, Black does not have to capture on f4...} 29. Rd1 {Even worse was 29.Rd2 exf4 30.Rf1 Bd4+ 31.Kh1 fxg3 ...} exf4 {The immediate 29...a4!? is also playable, but the game move has the advantage of blocking White's Rf2 away from the action, as White has to retake with the rook: 30.gxf4 Bd4 is simply awful for White, and 20.Nxf4 Bd4 31.Nxe6 Bxf2+ isn't much better.} 30. Rxf4 {Forced, but unfortunate: moving away from the 2nd rank gives Black the option of boxing it out of the game for now.} Bd4+ {Blocks off the important f2 square, preventing the rook from reentering the game there. Nor can the king take advantage of the chance to come back again: 31.Kf1 e5! 32.Rf3 a4 33.bxa4 Rxa4 34.Ke2 (even worse: 34.Ne3 Bxe3 35.Rxe3 Rf8+ 36.Ke1 Ra2 37.Rd2 b3 38.Ree2 Ra1+ 39.Rd1 Rxd1+ 40.Kxd1 Rf1+ 41.Kd2 b2 and White can resign) 34...Ra2+ 35.Rd2 Rxd2+ 36.Kxd2 Ra8 37.Ne1 Bc3+ 38.Kd1 Ra1+ and wins.} 31. Kh1 {With the king forced away from the action, Black is now free to enjoy all the benefits of a Q-side breakthrough.} a4 {Forcing the issue, and better now than later: Black would gain little and risk much by delaying this unnecessarily. Precise play is required though, should White go for the complications arising from 32.Rff1!? to which Black's best reply is 32...axb3 (closer analysis reveals that it is a required feature of the position that Black can keep White's knight away from c2: with the knight posted there, the a-pawn cannot queen) 33.Nf4 Rd6 34.Rb1 b2 35.Ne2 Be5 after which 36.d4!? fails to 36...cxd4 37.c5 Rc6 and the rook cannot capture the intrepid pawn on b2 due to d4-d3.} 32. bxa4 {Black must not succumpt to the temptation and mindlessly reply 32...Rxa4: a waste of time which might cost him the very victory he has worked so hard to ensure. The endgame is quite complex, for instance: 32...Rxa4 33.Rb1 Ra3 34.Rf3 Be5 35.Ne1 b3 36.d4 Bxd4 37.Rfxb3 and White has equalized. Or 34.Ne1 (instead of 34.Rf3) 34...b3 35.Rf1 b2 36.Nc2 Be5 37.Kg2 d4 (not 38.Kf3 Ra1 39.Nxa1 bxa1=Q 40.Rxa1 Rxa1 and Black has won) 38.d4! Bxd4 39.Nxd4 cxd4 40.Rxb2 with complex play.} b3 {With this (temporary) pawn sacrifice, Black wins an extremely important tempo. The advanced b-pawn restricts White's options significantly. Thus 33.Rb1 b2 34.Rff1 Rxa4 35.Nf4 Rda8 36.Nxe6 Ra1 37.Nxd4 Rxb1 38.Rxb1 Ra1 and Black wins. Or 33.Ne1 Rxa4 34.Nf3 Be3!! (prevents the bishop from being captured, forces the rook off the f-file and deeper into obscurity, and prevents the knight from reentering the game through d2) 35.Rg4 b2 36.Rb1 Ra1 and Black wins.} 33. Rff1 {Bolsters the 1st rank and vacates f4 for the knight. But with the pawn on b3 already, it cannot be captured merely - at best - contained. And even that will prove impossible.} e5 {Keeps the knight out of the game, and the wonderfully centralized bishop keeps a1 under tight control. White could try to bring the knight back with 34.Rb1 b2 35.Ne1, but Black will counter with 35...Bc3 36.Rf3 Rxa4 37.Nc2 Rda8 38.Rff1 Ra1 39.Nxa1 bxa1=Q 40.Rxa1 Rxa1 and Black wins.} 34. Ne1 {The central point of Black's play: with the pawn still on b3, the knight still cannot move on to c2, and thus remains locked out of the battle. As an added benefit (from Black's point of view) it now disrupts the communication between the rooks as well. Black may consider simply capturing the a4 pawn now, as 34...Rxa4 35.Nf3 Bc3 36.Rc1 Rxd3 37.Kg2 Rxc4 is clearly won.} Bc3 {Black decided to up the pressure on White's position first. On 35.Rc1 there now follows 35...b2, while 35.Rb1 is answered by 35...Bxe1 36.Rfxe1 Rxd3 37.Re2 Rxa4 38.Reb2 Rxc4 39.Rxb3 Rxb3 40.Rxb3 Rxe4 with a winning end-game.} 35. Nf3 {A very nice trap. If now 35...Rxa4? White slinks out of his troubles by means of 36.Nd2! b2 37.Nb1 and he has suddenly equalized after all. Black cannot go for 37...Ra1 as 38.Nxc3 Rxd3 39.Nb1 Rxd1 40.Rxd1 is simply lost.} b2 {Simple and direct.} 36. Nd2 {Offers up the bait again: 36...Rxa4? would lead to the same trap as before.} Rxd3 {But now, White is simply lost. The weak d-pawn has fallen at last, and with it any coherence in White's position. Black may now choose to enter via the d-file as well as the a-file, and White cannot block him any more.} 37. Nb1 {Offers to block the pawn with the knight while exchanging rooks. Black accepts.} Rxd1 {Exchanging the rooks greatly simplifies the win.} 38. Rxd1 Bd4 {Move the bishop out of the shadow of the knight, blocks the d-file, and covers all three pawns at the same time as well as preventing Nc3 for the time being.} 39. Rd3 {The knight must remain to cover b1.} Rxa4 {Brings the rook into play and threatens to remove the pawn preventing c5 from linking up with the b-pawn.} 40. Ra3 {Exchanging on a3 would now be a major mistake.} Rxc4 {Vacates the a-file, but the checks there are reasonably harmless. The check on c1 is, however, anything but.} 41. Ra8+ Kf7 42. Ra7+ Kg6 43. Ra6+ Kh5 {Moves the king into cover. Black has to consider the possibility here that the White pawns could actually move to mate him, if used in conjunction with the king and rook. He has, however, sufficient resources to prevent this with only moderately careful play.} 44. Kg2 Rc2+ {The king cannot move back to the 1st rank or the knight will be lost (after Rc1+).} 45. Kh3 Bg1 {Threatens mate after Rxh2.} 46. g4+ Kg5 47. Kg3 Bxh2+ 48. Kf3 Rc1 {On 49.Nd2 Black would simply reply 49...c4! which wins: 50.Ke3 c3 51.Nb1 c2 etc.} 49. Na3 Rc3+ {And White resigns.}
