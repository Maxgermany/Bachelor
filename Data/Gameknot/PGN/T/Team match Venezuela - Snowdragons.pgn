1. e4 {This is one of two games against maracuchov of Team Venezuela. The teams in this match consist of just 2 players, our other Snowdragons player being shakechess.} c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. Bf4 Bd6 {Game DB finds just one other similar game, where 6..., Bb4 was played.} 7. Bxd6 Qxd6 8. c5 Qe7 9. Bb5+ Nc6 10. Nf3 {I like the development of my pieces so far.} a6 11. Bxc6+ {Exchange Bishop for Knight, and black Bishop will be difficult to develop.} bxc6 12. O-O O-O 13. b4 {The game plan is to work on the Queen's side of the board, trying to make my c-pawn work up there.} Nd7 14. Re1 f6 {Black is looking for d4 which is weak.} 15. a4 e5 {But with the Rook controlling the e-file (black's e-pawn is pinned) there is no immediate threat for white.} 16. b5 {Continuing my plan to push my c-pawn.} axb5 17. axb5 Rxa1 18. Qxa1 Qe6 {18..., cxb5?. 19. Nxd5 and black's b-pawn will also go.} 19. b6 {Change of plan, the b-pawn is allowed onwards and it will win the Bishop. 19. bxc6?, Qxc6, now threatens continuation of black's plan on the King's side since e-pawn is no longer pinned.} g5 {g5?? 19...., Bb7! Allows the rook into play. } 20. Qa8 {By not playing the Bishop black has allowed the Queen on the 8th row.} g4 21. Nd2 e4 22. b7 Bxb7 23. Qxb7 Rb8 {Chances for black to re-establish a position.} 24. Qa7 Rb3 25. Ncxe4 {Terrible mistake. White thinks to develop into a winning endgame by exchanging the Knight for 2 pawns, but it doesn't develop that way...} dxe4 26. Rxe4 {Loses the Rook instantly. It looks like the Knight is covering b1 as well as the Rook but it can cover only one of those two. Qxe4 and Knigt can not take back because of checkmate on b1. 26...., Rb1. 27. Nxb1, Qxe4. 28. Qe2 , Kh8. 29. Qd2 defends d4 and checkmate on e1. This is the worst case expected by white....} Qxe4 {How frustrating, attacking both a Rook and a Queen but not being able to move that Knight.} 27. Qa2 {Pinning the rook, but too late.} Qe1+ 28. Nf1 Qb1 {This probably closes down the game for white. Allthough better was Qb4, to allow Rb1 and keep the Queen more active. Black probably wanted to exchange Queens here.} 29. Qa8+ {But exchanging Queens loses, with the Knight stuck there. White first tries to win some material, but it is probably a lost case already.} Kf7 {29...., Nb8! Saves the pawn and white's Queen is not very active anymore. Black should be looking for time to win white's knight at f1 by playing Queen and Rook. What can white do, 30. d5!? or 30. g3. In any case 30...., Qd3 will be a good move for black, aiming for Rb1 to look for the Knight or alternatively to look for a Queen's exchange on a6.} 30. Qxc6 {I was thinking of resigning at this point in the game, but you never know and one draw from my 2 games is all we need to win this team match after shakechess having won both his games.} Rb7 {Big mistake by black this time!! A fork on Rook and Knight is unavoidable. 30..., Qf5 defends Knight and d5 (White's Qd5  to win rook) at the same time. Note how after 30...., Qf5. 31. Ne3 is pointless for 31...., Rb1  32. Nf1. with definitely the best chances for black.} 31. Qd5+ Ke8 {Better is 31...., Kg7. 32. c6, Nb6. 33. Qd6 and black keeps Queen-hunting until saving the rook.} 32. Qe6+ {White is looking to fork the black rook and knight.   Actually white could have played c6 at this point already. 32. c6, Nb6?, Qg8 . 33. Ke7, Qg7  wins Rook. Other moves like 32. c6, Rb5. 33. Qe6  win Knight.} Kd8 33. c6 {The fork now also threatens checkmate on d7, defended by the Rook.} Rb6 {Black plays this move far too quickly and just notices the checkmate in one (34. Qxd7#) after hitting submit. He resignes immediately.  Other moves: 33.....Ra7. 34. cxd7 (not Qg8 , Ke7), Rxd7.  Looks like in any case black loses the Knight for the pawn but still has the best chances with Queen/Rook against Queen/Knight.  Exciting game, with blunders on both sides. Score in the match is now Venezuela 0 - 3 Snowdragons.}
