[Opening "Bird's opening (A03), Lasker variation"]

1. f4 {Not an uncommon opening. The idea is to get the KBP forward before planting the KN on the natural square, enabling this P to participate in a K-side thrust. And of course to veer down less explored paths than, say, the Queen's Gambit or the Ruy Lopez.} d5 2. Nf3 {Focusing attention on Black's K4.} Nf6 3. e3 {This opening is almost a mirror reflection of the English Opening. In that one, White plays P-QB4 and N-QB3, focusing on the light squares in the center. Here, White's focus is on the dark central squares.} Bg4 4. h3 {Naturally I have no intention of letting Black maintain the pin on my Knight.} Bxf3 5. Qxf3 {I wasn't expecting Black to so willingly give up a minor exchange.} a6 6. b3 {Intending to fianchetto the QB...} e6 7. Bb2 {...and increase my hold on the central dark squares.} Be7 8. Be2 {Time to focus on completing my development.} O-O 9. d3 {To clear Q2 for the Knight and avoid obstructing the long diagonal.} c5 10. c4 {Turning up the heat on Black's central pawns.} Ra7 11. Nd2 {The back rank is clear now.} b5 12. O-O {OK, development is finished.} bxc4 13. dxc4 {The first Pawn exchange.} Ne4 14. Nxe4 {This tactical skirmish...} dxe4 15. Qxe4 {...centralizes my Q nicely.} Qd2 16. Bd3 {Saving the B and threatening QxRP mate.} g6 17. Rab1 {The mate threat gave me time to guard the other B as well.} Rd8 18. Rfd1 {Naturally, I want to drive Black's Q from the heart of my position. I was expecting 18... Q-N5.} f5 19. Qe5 {Black's Q is still en prise, but I now have an additional threat...} Qa5 20. Qg7# {...which Black overlooks.}
