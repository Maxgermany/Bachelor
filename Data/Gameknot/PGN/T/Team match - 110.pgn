1. e4 e5 2. f4 {My opponent plays the King's Gambit, indicating a desire for a wide-open game.} exf4 {I am a gentleman. I always either accept the gambit, as I do here, or offer the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit (2... P-Q4).} 3. Nf3 g5 4. d4 g4 5. Ne5 {All book through here.} Qh4+ {One cannot be passive on the Black side of the King's Gambit. Counter-attack is the order of the day.} 6. Kd2 {Probably the safest spot.} Qf2+ {I am hoping to induce an exchange of Queens.} 7. Be2 {White does not oblige.} Nf6 {An attack by a single piece is virtually always doomed to fail. Instead of snatching the Pawn I develop.} 8. Nc3 {White adds another piece to the fray.} Bb4 {I develop with a pin.} 9. Kd3 {Unpinning.} d6 {I force a retreat and open a line for my Bishop to come out.} 10. Rf1 {Rather than retreat immediately, White attacks the Q.} Qxg2 {Now, since I have to move it anyway, I do take the Pawn.} 11. Nc4 {Forced to avoid losing the piece.} Qh3+ {Removing the defense of the KP.} 12. Kd2 {Virtually forced.} Nxe4+ {Adding another piece to the attack.} 13. Ke1 {The only legal move.} Qh4+ {White resigns, as the continuation would be 14 R-K2 QxR mate.}
