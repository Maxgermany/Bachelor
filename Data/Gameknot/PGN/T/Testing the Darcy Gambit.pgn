[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23)"]

1. e4 {In this game my opponent, Martin Darcy, tries out a new opening idea of his own invention. We start out with the Bishop's Opening....} e5 2. Bc4 Nc6 {A book move, but less common than 2... Nf6. I prefer the text move myself, because it makes it more likely we will transpose into my favourite Two Knights Defence, but it turns out that my opponent has something altogether different in mind....} 3. Bxf7+ {TN. (Although there is a known opening with this idea, the Jerome Gambit, if anyone wants to look it up.) White gives up a whole piece to tear open the Black king's pawn cover. This is certainly dangerous, but instinctively I feel it must be unsound; White has not enough pieces developed to organise an attack. It's true that Black is not yet developed either, but that gives Black the advantage of flexibility. For instance, since Black has not moved the king's knight, he can respond to Qf3+ with Qf6 -- and the last thing White wants is to exchange queens.} Kxf7 4. d3 {So, White to play and justify his gambit. As just stated, Qf3+ doesn't work, and nor does Qh5+; Black just plays g6 and there's no follow-up. White's only recourse is to develop his pieces rapidly, with this move and Nf3 in either order to prepare Ng5+.} Nf6 5. Nf3 Be7 {Black, meanwhile, prepares to "castle by hand". Once he plays Rf8, then Ng5+ will have no impact except for losing tempo for White.} 6. O-O {But White chooses to castle instead. "Do not castle except when strictly necessary, for the initiative is often lost by it." That said, Ng5+ at this point is really no more than a mild inconvenience to Black -- showing, I think, that Black has already refuted White's sacrifice. Black would respond with moves such as Ke8, Rf8, d6, and the king is safe enough in the centre, while White's having given Black a half-open file could actually work in Black's favour.} Rf8 7. a4 {(?) White seems to have forgotten that the point of Bxf7+ was to create attacking chances on the kingside. This move doesn't achieve much at all, because the queenside pawns are "flat" and there's no real chance yet for either side to break through there.} d6 8. Nc3 Kg8 {Now Black's king is safe and Black is a piece up. GameKnot scores this as +3.5 to Black: in other words, the attacking possibilities of the half-open f-file are worth more than the missing pawn.} 9. h3 {Necessary, since Bg4 would cause White severe problems right now. But the move also presents a target...} Qe8 {...and Black immediately plans to exploit it. The idea is Qg6 threatening Bxh3.} 10. Nb5 {White notices that in my single-minded focus on h3, I've left c7 undefended.} Bd8 {Not to worry; this bishop is only active on one diagonal so it's just as comfortable here as on e7. If instead 10... Qg6 11. Nxc7 Bxh3 White has 12. Nh4!, so I may as well just keep everything defended for now and continue to build up my attack.} 11. Bd2 Nh5 {So that my bishop prevents Nh4. Mind you, the move is not exactly subtle...} 12. Kh2 {...and White has this obvious reply. (Though GameKnot thinks this increases Black's advantage by a third of a pawn and 12... a6 gives it back again, so did I miss something?) Now the straightforward Qg6, Bxh3 is prevented, but I decide to proceed with my Qg6 plan anyway, on the optimistic basis that getting several attackers in the vicinity of the White king may lead to an opportunity to break through.} a6 13. Nc3 Qg6 14. Nd5 {White has lost a lot of time with this knight but it's not clear that Black has made the best use of it. I spent a long time over my next move, eventually deciding that the best way to proceed was to threaten exchanges, leaving both the possibilities of a winning attack and a winning endgame open without gunning for either approach exclusively.} Nd4 {With the threat of 15... Nxf3+, forcing White to recapture with the pawn and weaken his kingside. The move also vacates c6 so I can kick White's knight, and in doing so open a line for my bishop to reach the g1-a7 diagonal, where it would add pressure to the pawn on f2.} 15. Nxd4 {White decides to take the exchange on d4. Now Black's pawn will block the g1-a7 diagonal, but it also takes away the d5 knight's retreat...} exd4 16. g4 {...so White immediately responds by kicking my knight. I get an exchange, which should be in my favour, but my attacking prospects are being rapidly whittled away.} Nf6 17. Nxf6+ Bxf6 18. f4 {White goes for the imposing phalanx...} Bh4 {...and Black gets out of its way, since otherwise 19. g5 will make this a bad bishop. As played, if White plays g5 the bishop is cut off from friendly support, but White has no real way to attack it.} 19. c3 {Instead White decides to increase the scope of his own bishop.} dxc3 20. f5 {At this point I still didn't feel White's phalanx was much of a threat; it should be easy to keep it contained with an extra piece, right?} Qe8 21. Qb3+ Qf7 {And if White is going to offer me a chance to swap queens, you bet I'm going to take it.} 22. Qxf7+ Rxf7 23. Bxc3 Bd7 {It's time for my queen's bishop and rook to get out; neither of them has moved yet this game.} 24. d4 Re8 {Now White's pawns seem to be under control, and White cannot even back them up with Rae1 as my bishop controls that square. At this point I still thought it would be an easy win. What's notable about this game is that even though I get the piece advantage early on, I never seem to be able to make much use of it, and yet I'm not making any huge mistakes; indeed, GameKnot's analysis labels only FOUR moves as mistakes in the entire game, of which one is 3. Bxf7+ and two come after the contest was really over!} 25. e5 dxe5 26. dxe5 Bc6 {So White has a passed pawn now, and I have to duck to avoid the fork e6. Still, those advanced pawns should be easy to undermine and pick off with my superior piece power, shouldn't they?} 27. e6 Rff8 {And not 27... Rfe7?? 28. Bb4 and the rook is trapped!} 28. Bb4 {White forces off the bishops, so that Rae1 can be played. (Black's plan is to play g6, undermining the pawns; if f6, Rxe6; Rae1 would prevent this.)} Be7 29. Bxe7 Rxe7 30. b3 {However, this must be played first, to free the a1 rook from defensive duties...} g6 {...and that means Black has the chance to get this move in first.} 31. Rad1 {I think this is better than Rae1 now. The d7 square becomes an important factor.} gxf5 32. gxf5 Be4 {(?) Too hasty. I thought this move won the advanced pawns, overlooking White's reply. Note that if 33. f6 Rxe6 34. Rae1, Black can escape the pin by Bd5. GameKnot marks this as a mistake, favouring 32... Kg7, a more patient move that probably would lead to winning the pawns.} 33. Rd4 {(!) Now Black's in trouble.} Bxf5 {Now 33... Bc2 is met by 34. Rd7, while 33... Bc6 is insipid. White can double the rooks and Black will find it difficult or impossible to win the pawns. I felt my best hope now was to exchange my bishop for the pawns, remaining a pawn ahead, and try to win the rook ending. According to GameKnot, my advantage has decreased to +1.28.} 34. Rdf4 {I had seen this coming. Black must take the second pawn and abandon the bishop.} Rxe6 35. Rf4xf5 Rxf5 {Exchanging one pair of rooks gains a vital tempo for Black.} 36. Rxf5 Re3 {Now I felt I might still be winning after all. If I can gain a second pawn without losing one, I should win; and how can White defend b3?} 37. b4 Re4 {Back at move 32, when GameKnot flagged Be4 as a mistake, it predicted the subsequent moves up to this point and then gave 37... Ra3. From the human standpoint, though, this move is much better. After 37... Ra3 White saves the pawns with 38. a5. After the move played, he can still save the pawns, but... "the move is there, but you must see it." (And I missed it completely; White's next took me totally by surprise.)} 38. Rc5 {(!!) One of the most stunning and paradoxical moves I've ever seen played against me. If 38. b5 then Black avoids exchanging on b5, and instead wins with Rxa4. Yet b5 is the right idea -- it just needs to be prepared by first forcing Black to add an extra defender to that square!} c6 {I had now seen 39. b5, but there is no alternative to this move.} 39. Rg5+ {(?) White misses it! Though after this move, 40. b5 is still playable.} Kf7 40. Rg4 {(??) Not any more. Incidentally, we see here a fundamental flaw in GameKnot's analysis technique. It doesn't flag this, the game-losing blunder, as even being a mistake. Why? Because the difference it makes is "only" 0.75 of a pawn (the other 0.25 of it being lost on the preceding move -- if White had found 40. b5, then the intervening check would have slightly improved Black's position by activating his king). Yet in the endgame, it's all too easy for just one pawn to be the difference between a draw and a loss. After 40. b5 and the exchange of two pairs of pawns, we have the notorious R+P v R endgame, very difficult to play and very likely to be a draw.} Rxg4 {Black can't win a pawn, but he can simplify into a won king and pawns endgame. If there's one lesson I'd like you to take away from this annotation, it's this: ALWAYS calculate the king and pawns endgame before offering your opponent an opportunity to simplify into it! If it's a lost endgame, it may also be lost with pieces on, but at least you'll have more chance of your opponent making a mistake with pieces.} 41. hxg4 Ke6 42. Kg3 Kd5 43. Kf4 Kc4 44. g5 {(?) This blocks the only route White has to take h7 in three moves. After 44. Kg5 Kxb4 45. Kh6 c5 46. Kxh7 c4 47. g5 c3 48. g6 c2 49. g7 c1Q 50. g8Q Qh1+ 51. Kg7 Qg1+ Black wins -- this is the endgame I calculated before accepting the exchange of rooks -- but giving up tempi can only make it easier.} Kxb4 45. Kf5 c5 46. Kf6 c4 47. Kg7 c3 48. Kxh7 c2 49. g6 c1=Q 50. g7 Qc7 51. Kh8 Qxg7+ {And this is the fourth and last move flagged by GameKnot as a mistake. In a sense it's right -- with both a-pawns removed, 51... Qh2+ mates in 12, and I can't imagine that putting the a-pawns back on makes much difference to that -- but this came at a time when my opponent had been online for a while, we were making moves rapidly, and I wanted to get the game finished. More moves but much less thinking time needed this way!} 52. Kxg7 Kxa4 53. Kf6 b5 54. Ke5 b4 55. Kd4 b3 {White gives up, seeing that after 56. Kc3 Ka3 promotion cannot be prevented. Many thanks to my opponent; that was a very interesting game to play, and I hope you found it just as interesting to read!}
