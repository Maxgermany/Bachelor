1. e4 {I'll name this annotation "The Trojan Horse" - standard King's Pawn opening} e5 {Ã‰pine Dorsale - mutual King's Pawn opening} 2. Nf3 {Develop King's Knight - which is customary for me leading to my preferred Scotch Game, or Ruy Lopez when I'm feeling more aggressive} f6 {Damiano Defense - an inferior response} 3. Nxe5 {Damiano Gambit - poison chess at it's greatest.  It's an enticing capture that should be avoided, because that "piece" offering comes with bad intentions.} fxe5 {Gambit accepted, a common mistake taking the knight - which I refer to as the Trojan Horse} 4. Qh5+ {Once the Trojan Horse has been invited inside the walls of Troy, it's only a matter of time before the Spartans sack the city.  } Ke7 {From my frame of reference, Checkmate is inevitable at this point} 5. Qxe5+ {Keep Black's King in check, to separate further from his defenses} Kf7 {Only option for Black} 6. Bc4+ {Continued development for White, all while Black's future options are continuing to look bleak} Kg6 {Bad option for Black, sacrificing the Queen's Pawn in order to free up the Queen's Bishop, while attacking White's KB, would have been a more prudent option} 7. Qf5+ {The Spartans are running wild in the city!} Kh6 {Only move at this point, when your King is beyond your defenses - it's not a good place to be} 8. d4+ {Again, continued development for White while keeping Black in check} g5 {Only move available for Black, # of moves for Checkmate is dependent upon White's response} 9. h4 {First move in many that White does not check Black (please see above comment)} Kg7 {Shouldn't have been surprised by another poor move by Black, although I was....  Black may have prolonged Checkmate by KB to e7} 10. Qf7+ {It's as good as over with another check} Kh6 {Only option for Black} 11. hxg5# {Checkmate in 11 - take away, avoid poison pieces & expect the unexpected through respect of your opponent, assume their "mistake" was made intentionally - with bad intentions...  read Sun Tzu's Art of War for a fuller appreciation of these strategic theories.}
