1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 e6 4. Nf3 d5 5. Bb5 Nge7 6. exd5 Nxd5 {All book until now. This strange move is being encountered more often for some reason, perhaps to attack on f4. It allows white to double the c pawns as well, but that is not the best, since the c6 knight should remain a target. The best move for white is the most active move.} 7. O-O Nxc3 {7...Nxf4 8.d4, with plenty of activity for the pawn.} 8. bxc3 Bd7 9. f5 {Nice little idea to break open the center immediately and start an attack. By move nine, I have offered up a pawn to the opponent twice already. If you see a sacrifice for a gain in activity, you should always just play it, after calculating the basic variations. Since gaining activity is the main goal of chess, you will be doing the right thing. Usually, the opponent cannot use a pawn actively until the endgame. Most players are afraid to sacrifice activity unless it leads to a direct attack against the opponent's king. They are under the delusion that the opponent can simply neutralize their activity and trade to an endgame, where their material is decisive. Certainly that CAN happen, and the activity is a temporary advantage. Yet it is a much greater advantage than a pawn, and can easily lead to a quick win as well as gaining other permanent advantages. There are countless obstacles a player needs to pass before consolidating a pawn advantage. Also, it is much harder to find good moves when you have less activity, because that implies a defence. The attacker just makes threats, while the defender needs to check the opponent's tactics and think much harder.} Be7 {By the way, when I played 9.f5, I did not know whether or not the sacrifice is objectively best. However, I knew that it was the right decision to increase my activity. If a sacrifice increases your activity, you should calculate the main lines, then play it. Deep intuition and other grandmaster like skills are not needed to play a sacrifice.} 10. fxe6 Bxe6 11. Ne5 Qd6 12. d4 {White is now gaining a lot of activity in the position, and the removal of the f pawn has freed the rook and the dark squared bishop. The position is very open, so we should do piece play in the center.} O-O 13. Bf4 Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Qb6 {The first step to make a successful attack is to 1.Gain Piece Activity, more than your opponent. If your opponent has the better activity, he will easily counter your weaker forces and repulse your attack. But your more active pieces will overwhelm the defense easily if they are more active than them. Gaining activity is simple: Develop your pieces on the squares where they are most advanced and can also go to other forward squares. Also, do not capture the opponent's pieces unless you can get a tactical advantage, since that will increase your opponent's activity while decreasing yours. By the way, notice I am not talking about doubled pawns, open files, and space etc. The chess books offer these ideas to think about a position, but it is too much. All these ideas are smaller aspects of activity. Doubled pawns, if really weak, will always reduce the activity of your pieces or allow the opponent's pieces to become active by attacking the weakness. Open files, if occupied naturally give you activity. Just thinking about activity in general is much more useful for most class players to avoid getting too confused.} 15. Bd3 {We will now attack on the kingside, since we have a solid grip on the center. } g6 {Mistake, creating the weaknesses around the kingside. As you can see, the dark squared bishop's activity is increased, and the queen can suddenly go to the dark squares. The light squared bishop seems to be deactivated, but that is not true. The bishop is still hitting at the kingside, and preventing the h and f pawns from moving forward, since it would be more effective if they did.} 16. Qd2 Rfd8 {Seems so natural and strong, preparing ...Bf8. However, here is another rule: When you have activity advantage, you must be on the lookout every turn for combinations and tactical shots. Activity creates these tactics. ...f6 was stronger, even though it weakens the kingside. } 17. Bxg6 {The best move in the position, although it takes Shredder only a few seconds to see it. Taking with either the h or f pawn causes black to lose horribly. The second stage is 2.Turn your activity into an attack by gathering your pieces to the area and make threats. Moves Bd3 and Qd2 served that purpose. 3.The decisive combination is when you break the opponent's position and undergo a tactical operation, right now.} Bc4 {The best countershot. Now my opponent expected 18.Rf3 or Bd3, but not the move I played.} 18. Bxh7+ {Very strong move against the king, destroying it's cover completely and opening it to the mercy of the ideally placed attacking pieces that white has. You may ask: Why did he play this? Why did he not just consolidate his pawn advantage? Well, I knew that black would be under serious pressure here, and that he would make further mistakes after this Tal Like sacrifice. In open positions, attacking is much easier than defending, since the numerous attacking possibilities each need to be counted and prevented, while the attacker simply makes threats and find tactics. Even though not objectively correct, this move is really not risking much. Many masters would not find the best moves in the variations, which computer says only draws for them at best.} Kxh7 19. Rf3 {Very easy to find this move!} Rd6 {See? Right away black blunders after the sacrifice after long think. 19...Kg8! saved things and held. } 20. Qf2 {The best move again, and easy to find.} Kg8 21. Rh3 {Again, most accurate.} f6 {Now white is just winning, and the rest of the game is  mop up.} 22. Qg3+ Kf7 23. Rh7+ Ke6 24. Qg4+ f5 25. Qg7 {Black is now losing decisive material in all lines, so he gave up. As a summary on the attack, we need 3 steps usually.  1.Gain Superior Activity-Put your pieces forward as much as you can, and restrict the opponent's activity. 2.Convert-Use your superior activity to create threats. The concentration of pieces on an area is the best way to do this. 3.Decisive Blow-Once you have a concentration of pieces and create all sorts of threats, sooner or later you are bound to have a decisive combination to blast the opponent to pieces. You should always be on the lookout for tactics, but think about possible combinations on every turn once step 1 is achieved. Sometimes it is not always so easy to just follow the 3 steps- there are more, and this is the general way to do it. Your opponent will also try to gain activity and attack you. At some point, you will have contact, and the more active side will prevail. That is why activity is the #1 thing in chess.}
