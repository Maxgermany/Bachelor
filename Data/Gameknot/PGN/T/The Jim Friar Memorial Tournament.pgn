[Opening "QGD Slav (D11), 3.Nf3"]

1. d4 {Charles kicks off with his usual.} d5 {And, not surprisingly, Janet plays what I call the conventional line since this is the most common response.} 2. c4 {I also figured that Charles would play this.  That's because a most of Charles annotation involves the QG.} c6 {And, this is how I'd also respond as black since my response is the Semi Slav defense.} 3. Nf3 {Like before, this is what I also would've played because Charles is developing here.} dxc4 {But, I was surprised to see Janet take here.  Yes, black is a pawn up for now, but those are doubled pawns.  Of course, it doesn't matter now, but were I black, I wouldn't want to face this, keeping in mind that this could become a problem later on.  And, that is something that tactical-abyss has emphasized when it comes to doubled pawns.  He said that it all depends at what stage of the game you're at, more often then not.  Early on, it usually isn't a problem, but that could change as you get later in the game.} 4. e3 {Now, we're back into somewhat familiar territory since white's position is the same as what you see in the Colle's System.  Had black not taken that, this certainly would've transposed into that.  But, since it's now a little different and in a slightly different move order, it's not.  However, it's similar enough for me to know what I'm looking at.} Be6 {Not surprisingly, Janet develops.  I'm not sure what I would've played as black.  But, were this to be developed, I would have pinned white's Nf3, as this move blocks the center pawn.  I say that because in one of reachforgoals annotations, Erika did that, and people told her that it was generally not a good idea before I emphasized it.  So, even though I don't think anyone has an edge, I slightly prefer white's position, but you never know what to expect with stronger players, though.} 5. Nc3 {Meanwhile, Charles continues with his development.} Nf6 {As does Janet.} 6. Ng5 {Charles is going for an exchange which would benefit him.  That's because if he is to take, when Janet takes back, she's left with another bad set of pawns.  But, the difference is that they're right in the center.  In general, you don't want two sets of doubled pawns, at any phase of the game.} Bg4 {Therefore, Janet declines by attacking the Queen.} 7. f3 {Not only does Charles defend, but he launches an attack of his own.  And, when Janet retreats, white will win back the pawn.  He does this by taking advantage, and then, capturing one of the bad pawns.  Jack Stockel told me, that, in general, this is the way to go.} Bh5 8. Bxc4 e6 {As Charles had a potential threat on f7, Janet puts a stop to that.} 9. O-O {But, nothing, however, prevents him from castling.} Nbd7 {Meanwhile, Janet continues with her development.} 10. Bd2 {As does Charles.} Bg6 {Unlike before, I do not know why this was played.} 11. Rc1 {Nor do I understand this move.} Nd5 {My guess is that Janet wants Charles to exchange the N because his Bc4 is stronger.} 12. Nh3 {But, Charles refuses, and instead, Janet forces a different type of exchange.} Nxc3 13. Bxc3 Bd6 {Continuing with her development and getting ready to castle.} 14. e4 {At some point, Charles plans to hit black's Bd6.  So, the idea now is breaking through.} O-O {Meanwhile, Janet also castles here.} 15. Qd2 {Getting his Queen into action.} Qb8 {But, I don't know why Janet played this.  It doesn't appear to get the Queen into action since it's still on the eighth rank.} 16. e5 {Plus, Charles goes on the attack, at once.} Be7 17. Bb3 {I do not know why Charles played this.  In fact, I'm not going to understand black's next move, or white's move after this.  To my knowing, they'll advance the a pawns to get a semi open file.} a5 18. a4 Qc7 {But, this move makes sense.  Since it's passed the eighth rank, Janet's Queen is now in action.} 19. Qe2 {But, I am not sure why Charles played this since his Queen was already centralized.  Plus, I don't see the danger with the Queen remaining on d2.} Nb6 {But, Janet, however, is bringing her N to a better outpost, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.} 20. Nf4 {As does Charles.  Not only that, but he want's to exchange pieces, as this would leave black's King vulnerable.} Bf5 {So, Janet puts a stop to that.} 21. g4 {Therefore, Charles takes advantage by attacking.  And, after black defends by attacking the white's Nf4, white will centralize his Bc3.  First, he's adding a defender.  But, my main inference is that he is going for a centralized position which, to my knowing, happens when all of the pieces are in the center.} Bg5 22. Bd2 {And, in the process, Janet will force another exchange.  Just when I thought that I was used to seeing everything, there's always something different with this position.  But, that's why reversion recommended that I annotate games by stronger players.  And, it's also the reason that I enjoy doing it.} Bxf4 23. Bxf4 Bg6 {Not surprisingly, Janet protects to prevent losing material.} 24. Qd2 {Unlike before, this move makes sense.  In the retreat, Janet was threatening to skewer with 24...Bd3  Obviously, Charles cannot allow that, as then, he loses a Rook for Bishop.  So, he put a stop to that.} h5 {Just like when the a pawns were advanced, I don't know why this was played.} 25. h3 {I'm also not completely sure why this was needed.  I don't see how the g pawn was threatened since it appeared to be protected by the f pawn.  But, I guess that the attack was stronger then one would realized which is safe to then infer that added protection was needed here.} Rfd8 {Meanwhile, Janet centralizes her Rook.} 26. Bg5 {And, Charles goes on the attack which is going to result in the next move.} Rdf8 27. f4 {This is not a passed pawn, so I'm surprised that Charles advanced.  Therefore, he wasn't giving extra protection, so that brings me back to square one.  This means that I don't know why those couple of moves were played.} Qd7 {Meanwhile, Janet centralizes her Queen.} 28. Rf2 {And, Charles has plans to double up.  As Jack Stockel told me, even recently, this is a good strategy because doubled rooks on one file are known to be dangerous.} Nd5 {At first, I wasn't sure why Janet played this since Charles f4 pawn is protected.  The only thing I could figure is what TA said which is the N visualization count.  But, it's not applicable.  As I figured out that black is hoping that white exchanges the N.  I didn't see it, but I guess that white has an advantage, so Janet is doing what she can for counterplay.  And, it's safe to infer that because if my instincts are right, this also means that white's Bb3 is stronger, in which, black is well aware.  Charles, however, also knows that since he refuses the exchange.} 29. Rcf1 {Instead, he doubles up, at once.} Be4 {I believe that Janet is trying to prevent Charles from advancing the f pawn.} 30. f5 {But, he does it anyway.} hxg4 {Not to my surprise, though, she takes.} 31. f6 {Believe it or not, I thought that Charles was going to take back.  But, I like this move even better because he is breaking through.  And, in the process, it also appears that he is weakening blacks monarch with some pressure against it.} g3 {Doing what she can for counterplay, Janet attacks the Rook.} 32. Re2 {But, Charles defends.} Bg6 {Trying to prevent the breakthrough, Janet pulls back.} 33. Rg2 {So, given that this doesn't lose anything now, Charles takes advantage of this by blocking the pawn.  And, with it, Janet resigned here.  You won't believe it, but since it appears even, and a lot to fight for, I would not have done that.  Instead, my next move, more then likely, would've continued with something like 33...gxf6.  But, stronger opposition like these two players see things that I and others don't.  Therefore, the position, to my gathering, has to be hopeless for black.  Afterall, Charles will break through, and I guess compromise the K.  And, on top of that, with the pawn blocked, there is nothing that black can do to stop this.  I hope you enjoyed this game, and in the future, probably after the OTB Games, so when the tourney starts, or maybe before, I'll be annotating games from the tournament I'm currently in.  It will mainly be from the stronger players since I know even more of them then in this tournament or Reversion's Open Fire, for that matter.}
