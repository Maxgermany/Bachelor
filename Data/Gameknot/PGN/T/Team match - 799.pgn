1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 d6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. Bc4 Nf6 8. f3 {And another Sicilian Dragon -- I tend to play these quite often as white as well as black, as I enjoy the complications in the games.} Nd7 9. Qd2 O-O 10. h4 Nxd4 11. Bxd4 Ne5 12. Bb3 b6 13. O-O-O {I'm not sure if this is still theory, but it can't be far off...} Bb7 14. h5 {This seemed a good time to start pushing for a big kingside attack. Maybe this wasn't well enough supported at this point though :S} a6 15. f4 Nd7 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. h6+ Kg8 18. Qd4 {Threatening checkmate at Qg7#} Nf6 19. Nd5 {Threatening to take the b6 pawn or the d pawn with Nxf6 exf6 Qxd6} Bxd5 20. Bxd5 Rb8 21. e5 {This is silly, and loses all of the attacking pressure. 21. g4 would be much more sensible, and the threat of g5 is big:  21. g4 e5 22. fxe5 dxe5 23.Qxe5 wins a pawn and the threat of Bxf7 is big (discovered attack on the queen with the rook, and if the queen goes down the f6 knight is unprotected).} Nxd5 22. Qxd5 e6 23. Qxd6 Qxd6 24. Rxd6 {Position is now highly simplified, and there is little white counter-play left.} Rfd8 25. Rhd1 Rxd6 26. Rxd6 Kf8 27. Kd2 Ke7 28. Kd3 Rd8 29. Rxd8 Kxd8 30. Kc4 Kd7 31. b4 {I am hoping that the extra pawn may cause enough pressure for black to slip up, but the game now looks drawn to me.} Kc6 32. a4 b5+ 33. Kb3 {Hoping for 33... bxa4 34. bxa4 -- I am hoping that the passed c pawn will give me some chances.} Kd5 {Hmm... can black really storm in and take out my kingside pawns before I can promote on the queenside?} 34. g3 bxa4+ {This must be a blunder. Ke4 allowing 35. axb5 axb5 seems to hold out for longer, but Black may still need to hold the Queenside to prevent promotion...} 35. Kxa4 Kc4 36. Ka5 Kc3 37. Kxa6 {If 37... Kxb4 then 38.Kb6 wins as black cannot prevent white from getting to the black pawns. If black goes towards g3, c2 can Queen when the white king reaches d6.} Kxb4 38. Kb6 Kc3 39. Kc6 Kxc2 40. Kd6 {Game annotation for team benefit ... apologies for any mistakes!}
