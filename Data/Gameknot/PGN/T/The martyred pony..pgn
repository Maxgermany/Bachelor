[Opening "Dunst (Sleipner,Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"]

1. Nc3 {This seems to be called either the "van Geet", after a Dutch International Master, or the "Dunst" opening after a New York master.  It's a flexible opening that allows quite a few transpositions, but is less popular than some due to the possibility of black playing d5-d4, forcing the knight to move.} e5 {Since I don't know the opening, I decided to develop as normal; however, 1...e5 is apparently considered dangerous due to the possibility of a center counterattack by white via Nf3.  I don't know that, so jump right in.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Here's a famous game by Ted Dunst (taken from wikipedia):  Dunst-Gresser, New York 1950 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Bg5 d5? (better is 5...Bb4 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.Qd4 Be7 8.e4 0-0 9.Bd3 h6 10.Bf4 d5 11.0-0 dxe4 and the game was soon drawn in Ekebjaerg-Oim, 14th World Correspondence Chess Championship) 6.e4! Be7 7.Bb5 Bd7 8.exd5 Nxd5 9.Nxd5 Bxg5 10.Qe2  Ne7? (Losing at once. 10...Be7 11.0-0-0 is also very awkward. Although it's unpleasant, Black should have tried 10...Kf8.) 11.Qe5! Bxb5 12.Nxc7  Kf8 13.Nde6  (now 13...fxe6 14.Ne6  wins Black's queen) 1-0 (notes based on those by Tim Harding)} 3. e3 d6 4. Bb5 Bd7 5. d3 {White's pawn development is very passive, preventing development of the dark bishop and keeping the game closed.} Nf6 6. O-O Be7 7. a3 {This seems to be a wasted move, but in a closed game, rapid development isn't as important as a solid position.  This prevents Nb4, but I had no intention of moving my knight.} O-O 8. h3 {Another unnecessary move that again restricts movement of my knight.  Advancement of the king's protective pawns weakens the castled king.} a6 {Forcing the bishop to retreat or trade.  This is different from 7. a3 in that I did it for a specific purpose rather than "by rote".} 9. Bc4 {Pinning my f pawn.  I dislike bishops on the a2-g8 diagonal, or the b1-h7 diagonal, when I play black. } Be6 {!? (Interesting move)  I decide to offer a bishop trade in the hopes of opening the f file for my rook while removing the hated bishop.  I marked this as interesting, not so much because of the individual move itself, but rather the idea behind it.} 10. Bxe6 fxe6 {Normally doubled pawns are seen as a weakness because they can't protect each other.  In this case, I decided a minor weakness was worth the pressure I could put on the half-open f file.} 11. Ne2 d5 {?! (Dubious move)  This forces me to use pieces to defend both e pawns, emphasizing the problem with doubled pawns.  Nd5 or Nd7 followed by Bg5 or Bh4 may have been better here.  I intended to force white's knight to move with e4, but went about it badly and almost got myself into trouble.} 12. Ng3 {Bringing the knight to the kingside where it will help attack my undefended pawns.  This knight doesn't move again, but does prevent me from occupying several critical squares during the course of the game.} Bd6 {It would have been better to play e4 first as this allows 13. e4.  On the other hand, 13. dxe4 dxe4 (Nxd4 14. Nxe4 dxe4) opens the d file for counterplay and isolates my doubled pawns.  I still think Nd7 followed by Bg5 or Bh4 would have been better.} 13. e4 {!? (Interesting move)  Closes the b8-h2 diagonal and makes my bishop look a little foolish.  On the other hand, it opens the d4 square and the a7-g1 diagonal.  White should probably open the game, but I believe he was still eyeing my pawns and this traps the pawn on e5.} Nd7 {Opening the f file.} 14. Ng5 {Attacks my e6 pawn and threatening Qh5 followed by Qxh7#.} Qe7 15. Qg4 {Pressuring my helpless pawn.  Qh5, forcing a pawn move and weakening my king, would be better.} Rf6 {Protecting my pawn, but more importantly, lifting my rook to allow the other to move in behind it.} 16. h4 {Prevents Rg6 which would pin the knight and possibly win it if followed by h6.} Raf8 {? (Bad move)  Doubling rooks was my goal, but with the knight on g5, this was the wrong time to do it.} 17. h5 {?! (Dubious move)  Unnecessary and perhaps weakening.  White needs to develop his bishop and bring his other rook into play.  Nxh7 followed by Bg5 blunts my attack and looks interesting for white.} Nd4 {?! (Dubious move)  Blissfully unaware of the dangerers of Nxh7, I try to bring my knight into the struggle on the kingside.} 18. Qd1 {?! (Dubious move)  Retreating the queen to defend against a minor threat (Nxc2), this relieves pressure on my kingside.  Developing the bishop or Nxh7 (again) is better.} h6 {The thought was to force the knight to retreat, but actually taking the knight would allow Bxg5, trading my rook and pawn for a knight and bishop, which would remove my greatest asset, the rook battery, and allow white to bring his other rook into play.  This does prevent the previously mentioned Nxh7 followed by Bg5 threat, as well as prevent h6, so it's not all bad.} 19. Nh3 {c3 is probably better, forcing my knight to retreat and preparing for an eventual d4 to open up the game.  As mentioned last move, the knight is safe on g5 as taking it allows Bg5, winning my rook.} Bc5 {Moving my bishop to the critical diagonal.} 20. Kh2 {Always good to move the king out of the line of fire, but Kh1 may have been better.} Nf3+ {! (Good move)  Sacrificing my knight to open the f3 square.  My queen was clamoring to move and the rook blocked her path.  I considered Qf7, followed by moving my knight off of the a7-g1 diagonal, and Bxf2, but that seemed far too slow.} 21. gxf3 {If 21. Kh1, then ...Nh4 followed by ...Nxg2 accomplishes much the same thing.} Rf6xf3 {Things get interesting here and I'm not sure I even see all the possibilities of the next few moves, much less be able to write about or explain them.  22. Ng1 Qh4  23. Nh3 (Kg2 Rxf2  24. Rxf2 Rxf2  25. Kg1 Qh2#) Bxg2 and one of the knights fall. } 22. Qe2 {Helps protect the f pawn, but it's a weak defense.  White really needs his other rook and bishop in play, but there's no time to do that now.} Qh4 {Pins the h3 knight and indirectly pins the g3 knight because of Qxh3 .  Threatens Rxf2  23. Rxf2 Rxf2 , winning the queen.} 23. Kg2 Qg4 {I felt like I needed an extra piece in play, to prevent the king from escaping, so decided to bring the knight over.  This protects my rook and allows Nf6.  It looks like the knight is unneeded since Bxf2! leads to 24. Rxf2 (Nxf2 Rxg3#) Qxg3  25. Kf1 (Kh1 Qh3  26. Rh2 Rf1  26. Qxf1 Rxf1#) Qxh3  27. Kg1 (or Ke1 Qh1  28. Qf1 Qxf1  wins at least a rook and may lead to mate) Rxf2 wins a queen for a rook.} 24. Kh2 Nf6 {Bxf2 seems to win here, though these lines were worked out by hand on the analysis board, so I'm probably still missing something:  25. Nxf2 Qxg3  26. Kh1 Qh4  27. Nh3 (Kg1 Rg3#) Qxh3 28. Qh2 Rxf1# 25. Rxf2 Qxg3  26. Kh1 Qxg3  27. Kg1 Qg3  28. Kg1 (Kf1 Rxf2  29. Qxf2 Qxf2#) Rxf2 29. Qxf2 Rxf2 followed by ...Qh2# or Qg2#.} 25. Rg1 Nxh5 26. Rg2 {The time taken to move the knight into position allowed white time to regroup.  If he can move his bishop out and bring his other rook into play, he may have a viable defense, but there's still no time.  If Nxh5, then Qh3#. 26. Be3 Bxe3 leads to a more restrictive version of what we arrived at next move because the king doesn't have g1 as a flight option.} Qh4 {Pins the knights again with the same threat, though Kg2 is no longer available to break the pin.} 27. Be3 {Allows the other rook to protect the back rank and attempts to protect the pawn, but again, it's too late.  If Kg1 to help protect the f pawn, then Qxh2 removes protection from the f pawn.} Bxe3 {Since the goal was to remove the f pawn protecting the g3 knight, capturing the bishop or pawn works just as well.} 28. fxe3 Rxg3 {White resigned.  0-1  29. Rxg3 Qxg3  30. Kh1 Qxh3  31. Kg1 (Qh2 Ng3  32. Kg1 Rf1  33. Rxf1 Qxf1#) Ng3 32. Qg2 Qxg2  33. Kxg2 Nh5 leaves black with a knight and connected passed pawns, more than enough to win. 29. Kg1 Qxh3, after which black should give up on mate and trade down to the won endgame mentioned a moment ago.
