1. e4 {Here's a strange game that I won despite a series of blunders that deserved to lose.  Fortunately my opponent had already ceded plenty of material.  It's hardly a game "worthy of publication" but it does show the value of perseverance :-)  As it's a team game, we must have had similar ratings at the start, and my opponent won with White.  My rating has only recently shot up as a result of several fast ladder games against low-rated opponents, so don't expect my play to be commensurate with my current lofty rating.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 Bc5 {A popular response to the Spanish, putting pressure on f2 to inhibit White's attack.} 6. O-O Nf6 7. d3 d6 8. h3 Bd7 {We're both adopting a conservative approach to the game.  Apparently, there's a long war of attrition ahead.} 9. Nc3 {Normally, in the Spanish, I develop this knight via d2 and f1 e3 or g3 to f5 or d5 but, in this position, I'm still defending f2 with my rook, so the knight can't go to f1.  Also, I normally play c3 to support a pawn advance to d4, but as my d-pawn is defending e4, I can't do that without defending e4 some other way.  Anyway, the result is that I'm developing in an unfamiliar fashion.} Nh5 {?  This move gives White a pawn, as I proceed to demonstrate.} 10. Nxe5 dxe5 11. Qxh5 g6 12. Qf3 {keeping the pressure on f7} Be6 13. Nd5 {reaching d5 in two moves rather than 4 by the usual route!, with eyes on f6 and c7} Bxd5 14. Bxd5 {renewing the threat to f7 and simultaneously threatening the Nc6} Qd7 {Black easily defends against those threats.  Now White seeks to exploit the holes in Black's kingside with Fou Lenoir} 15. Bg5 Nd4 {By attacking Glenda, Black is able to ignore the pin against the Ra8} 16. Qf6 {further penetrating the kingside.  Black could still castle kingside but Bh6 would then threaten mate in 1, the knight would then have to impale himself to save his sire: 16...0-0 17. Bh6 Ne6 18. Bxe6 fxe6, leaving Black with doubled e-pawns.  Alternatively, White could just win the exchange on a8.} Rf8 17. Bxa8 Be7 18. Qxa6 {? over-complicating things and giving back Fou Lenoir unnecessarily.  18. Qxe5 f6 19. Qd5 was better.} Bxg5 19. c3 Ne2+ 20. Kh1 Ke7 {avoiding the skewer from c6} 21. Bd5 Nf4 22. Qc6 Nxd5 23. Qxd5 {the exchanges favour White as he's material up already.} f6 24. Qxd7+ Kxd7 {Now, with two extra pawns and the exchange it ought to be plain sailing for White.  I know several players who would resign in Black's position but his dogged persistence nearly scrapes a draw.} 25. g3 {threatening to trap Black's bishop} f5 26. f4 exf4 27. gxf4 Bh4 {Black keeps his B ahead of his pawns, restricting White's rooks' choice of moves} 28. e5 {White creates a protected passed pawn and embarks on a simple plan to force a central pawn through to promotion.} Ke6 {Black blockades} 29. d4 {The rolling pawn barrage gets moving.} c6 30. b3 h6 31. c4 b4 32. a3 Be7 33. axb4 Bxb4 34. Ra6 {White immediately exploits the newly opened a-file.} Rc8 35. d5+ {exploiting the pin on c6} Kd7 36. Ra7+ Ke8 37. d6 Kf8 38. Rd1 Rb8 39. e6 Bc5 40. Rh7 {? distracted from the task in hand.  40. Rc7 was better.} Rxb3 {else White would have won the Rook with 41. Rh8+ followed by Rxb8} 41. Rxh6 {?? watch how White's rook gets trapped.} Kg7 42. d7 {if 42. Rh4 Bf2 traps the rook} Be7 {covering both h4 and d8} 43. Rxg6+ {kamikaze rook at least takes a pawn with it} Kxg6 44. d8=Q Bxd8 45. Rxd8 {Despite his poor play, White is still two pawns up, one of which is near to promotion} Rxh3+ 46. Kg2 Re3 47. Rd6 Kf6 48. Rxc6 Rxe6 49. Rxe6+ {Now I hope to force home one of my pawns while Black's attention is divided} Kxe6 50. Kf3 Kd6 51. Ke3 Kc5 52. Kd3 Kc6 53. Kd4 Kd6 54. c5+ {Black had gained the opposition but White is able to use his pawn to return the favour} Kc6 55. Kc4 {rather than go straight for the f6 pawn, I push Black's King back further first.  This gains White a crucial tempo to prevent Black getting to e7.} Kd7 56. Kd5 Kc7 57. Ke5 Kc6 58. Kxf5 Kxc5 59. Ke6 {and Black finally resigned as he couldn't prevent the pawn queening.}
