1. f4 {Another game in freddy's second Annotation Project--In this one, I'm playing my friend Joanne.  While I'm sure others will find other errors made in this game, I believe that this game revolves around Two Errors--the first by Joanne and the second by me.  The action begins at move 9.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 Bg7 {This has become the standard move in this tourney.} 10. Ne6 Qg8 11. O-O {Joanne, adhering to sound principles, quickly castles and gets her King to safety.} b6 {Based on my other experiences in this tourney, I also begin the process of moving my King to safety.} 12. Na3 {From reading another of Joanne's annotations, I think she moves 12. Na3 rather than 12. Nc3 to avoid 12...Bxc3, hurting her pawn structure in the exchange.  Indeed, I have played Bxc3 in another game in this tourney.  In this game, that Knight never moves again.} Kb7 {Continuing to move my King to safety.} 13. Re1 {White begins to work toward equalizing the material deficit.} h5 {13...h5 was done to force the Bishop back to g3 and keep it off of the h1-a8 diagonal where Black's King currently resides.} 14. Bh3 Nd7 {14...Nd7--Black is eying either Nc5 or Nf8 to drive away White's Knight.} 15. Nxg7 {Herein lies the beginning of White's error.  White exchanges N for B.  However, White takes a very active piece and in the exchange, gives Black a little breathing room.} Qxg7 16. Bxd7 {This completes White's error.  Joanne believes the Knight was en prise and that she has evened the material deficit.   } Qd4+ {The error becomes apparent as White will now lose the Bishop.} 17. Kh1 Qxd7 {To be honest, at this point in the game I believed that if I played carefully, Black wins.  Black's Queen is in a good position and Black's King is tucked away.  White has lost her two most active pieces, she is behind in development, and behind in material.  } 18. Rxe4 Qg4 19. h3 Qd1+ {My thought in moving Qd1+ was to slow White's development while I brought my pieces into play.} 20. Kh2 Rhf8 {Look--it's working.} 21. d3 g5 {21...g5.  I wanted to get the f-file clear to bring more of pieces to bear.} 22. Rb1 g4 {Here I was thinking I'd keep White's Bishop from fully developing.  Perhaps I became over-focused on slowing down White's development at the cost of my own?} 23. Re3 {22. Re3 seems an error to me as it allowed my rook to get much more involved.} Rxf4 24. Rxe7 {We are one move from Black's error.  } gxh3 {I know this seems a blunder but, as hard as this is to admit, I knew that my Rook was going to be taken.  I still don't know what my plan was by 24...gxh3.  This was not a rushed move--simply an error in thinking.  Much, much better would have been Rf1.  I worked out a few lines and they all led to a Black win after 24...Rf1.} 25. Bxf4 Qg4 {I know that Joanne is far too strong a player to walk into mate via Qxg2.  It was about here that I felt the best outcome for Black was going to be a draw.} 26. g3 Rf8 27. Rg1 Rxf4 {Another Rook sac.  This time, it's to escape with a draw.  } 28. gxf4 Qxf4+ 29. Kh1 Qf3+ 30. Kh2 Qf2+ 31. Kh1 {I could not move 31...h2 as that allowed the Rook on g1 to escape.} Qf3+ {Here I offered the draw and Joanne accepted. My thanks to Joanne as I always have enjoyable and interesting games when I play her.  So there you have it.  A Tale of Two Errors.  }
