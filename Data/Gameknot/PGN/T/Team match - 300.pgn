Now that both players have castled, we can embark on complications.} Bxc3 9. bxc3 {A simple exchange is the opening salvo.} b6 10. Re1 {I hope to be able to exploit my central Pawns.} Bb7 11. Ne5 {Pressing onwards...} Nbd7 12. Nxd7 {Rather than retreat, I swap down.} Nxd7 13. Ba3 {Developing my last minor piece.} Re8 14. Qf3 {No specific threats, but on principle it's always good to aim your pieces at the other player's King.} Nf8 15.

Kh1 {Practically forced... but now my Bishop will fall as well. I should probably resign...} Qxd3 25. Qe6+ {H'mm, what's this? Black's King is exposed...} Kh8 26. Qf6+ {Well, look at that! I've got...} Kg8 27. Qg7# {...a forced mate!}
