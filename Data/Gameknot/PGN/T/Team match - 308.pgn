1. e4 {I had in mind the Kings Gambit. Though Black went Sicilian I stuck with my original idea.} c5 2. f4 Nc6 3. Nc3 g6 {Black has good intentions, fortifying his g7 diagonal.} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. b3 {Copy cat? After my move, I see the capture of my knight doubling my pawns.} Nf6 {Black loves that fianchetto and doesn't care to disturb its structure.} 6. Bb2 {Going through with development. } O-O {Looks solid enough.} 7. d4 {Probably opening myself up to all kinds of harm!} d5 8. e5 {I think I benefit to keep that Queen file "closed."} Nh5 9. Bc1 {Falling back in de-fence!} Bg4 10. Be2 cxd4 {Many ways to run here. First the capture of the kings knight, then capture the queens pawn with the knight but then the white bishop can stab the knight on the edge ruining blacks castled position.} 11. Nxd4 Bxe2 12. Ncxe2 {Keeping the position solid} Qa5+ 13. Bd2 Qc5 14. Be3 {Dancing a fine line when I need to castle!} Rac8 15. O-O {Still not happy with the black diagonal to my king } Nxd4 16. Nxd4 {The only way to recapture and protect my QBP} Bh8 {Not sure of Blacks intent with such a move!?} 17. Rc1 {Beef up support to use my knight elsewhere!} Ng7 {There I see the smothered mate possibility.The knight move exposing the bishop attack on the queen and defending said bishop adds icing to the cake! } 18. Nf5 Qb4 {QxB+ was the game prolonging move.} 19. Nh6# {}
