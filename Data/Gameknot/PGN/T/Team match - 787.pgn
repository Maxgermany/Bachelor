Bxd4 {and completing queen offer and attacking knight in this way.} Nh5 {running away with knight.} 21. Bxa7 {taking pawn.

I dont know what is the planning. I think he wasted 2 moves.} 29. Nb5 {giving support, defending rook.} Rc2 {dont like the little game in the corner anymore and attacks the pawn.} 30. Nc7 {attacking rook} Rxc7 {taking the knight, that is attacking the rook. He must offer 2 points.} 31. Bxc7 {taking rook, gained 2 points. Totally 7 points now.} Ra8 {running away for my rook.} 32. Re7 {attacking undefended pawn.} f6 {running away, to stay in defence of the pawn at g7 that is in defence of the king.} 33. Re5 {looks risky. It is. It looks like a blunder. It is. I was forgotten the pawn at a 5. When it wasnt there, this was a good move. I cant explain exactly. Are there volunteers that can explain in a comment??} fxe5 {taking undefended rook} 34.
