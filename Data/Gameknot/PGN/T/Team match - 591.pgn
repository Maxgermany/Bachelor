1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bf4 e5 8. Bg5 a6 9. Na3 b5 {Main line of the Sicilian Pelikan variation} 10. Bxf6 {White's other choice is the immediate Nd5.} Qxf6 {A mistake; I play Nd5 with tempo, and black must be wary of tactics.} 11. Nd5 Qd8 {Forced.} 12. Bxb5 {I will get two pawns and a rook for two pieces, a material advantage, after black's best moves} axb5 13. Nxb5 Qa5+ 14. c3 Rb8 {Obviously Qxb5 loses to Nc7+ with Nxb5. Black's best try was actually 14..Ra7, being wary of his queen's location..} 15. b4 {! and the queen is trapped.}
