1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The Philidor Defense, simple and solid} 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 c5 {first move that bothers me.  although tempting to start kicking around the knight, you've now left a gaping hole on d5.  Play could continue 5. Nf3 Nf6  6. Nc3 Nc6  7. Bc4 Be6  8. Qe2 Be7  9.Bg5 0-0  10. 0-0-0 and and white can use d5 as a stronghold.} 5. Bb5+ Bd7 6. Bf4 {?? loses the knight on d4} cxd4 7. Qxd4 {?? loses the bishop on b5, better would have been to minimize the damage with 7. Bxd7  followed by taking on d4.} Bxb5 {black has a massive advantage after 7 moves, and winning should consist trading off all of white's pieces and with your extra knight and bishop, mop up in the endgame.} 8. Nc3 Nc6 9. Qd5 Ba6 10. O-O-O Nf6 {good, developing with tempo} 11. Qf5 Be7 12. e5 {while white is down 2 pieces, he is doing a very good job of keeping pressure on black's position.  Black can either give up a little material to relieve the pressure, or start a little fire as well.} g6 {The fire it is...} 13. Qg5 {bad to worse, putting the queen in line of the bishop allows the knight a free move.  Better was Qh3} Nh5 {excellent, attacking the queen, and preparing to trade off another of white's attackers} 14. Qg4 Nxf4 15. Qxf4 {?? the bishop was taboo, since black now has Bg5, pinning the queen to the king.  White would have to live with being 3 pieces down or resign.} g5 {?? Bg5!! ends the game instantly, pinning the queen to the king, and white would have nothing left to fight for.} 16. Qf5 {Black is still winning, but made things harder than they needed to be} Nxe5 {white could still understandably resign by this point} 17. Nd5 Bc4 18. Ne3 Be6 {the bishop on e6 is very well placed to oversee action on both sides of the board.} 19. Qe4 Rb8 20. Nf5 Bf6 {? allows the knight to start causing problems, by letting him take on d6.  Better was simply exchanging to a winning with Bxf5.} 21. Nxd6+ Qxd6 {?? aah!  why?  Kf8 would've been fine, a little unpleasant, but fine.} 22. Rxd6 {Black has three pieces for a queen, which is normally not bad, but white's queen is very strong in the center, and his rooks are about to be very active.  Black now has to play this accurately to keep up the fight.} Ke7 23. Rhd1 Nc4 24. Rd6d7+ Kf8 25. Rc7 {if white wanted to get 2 pieces for the rook, he should have tried 24. Rxe6  fxe6  25. Qxc4, but now black can start causing some annoyances} Bxb2+ 26. Kb1 {things have gotten very complicated, 26...b5 trying to hold things together is an idea, since a knight and a bishop tend to outweigh a rook, but this is definitely a messy situation} Kg7 27. Qf3 Bf6 28. Qe2 Kg6 {?! the rooks need to get active, although it stops the threat of Qxe6, it exposes your king more than it should  28...Rhc8 stops white from getting two pieces for the rook, and gets the rest of your pieces in the fray.  If 28...Rhc8 Qxe6  29. Rxc7 is fine, threatening Na3  and Rxc2#} 29. Qe4+ Kh6 {Better than Kg7 which allows Qxe6} 30. Rxc4 Bxc4 31. Qxc4 Kg6 32. Rd3 Rhc8 33. Qb3 b6 {?! allows the rook to get on d7 and make annoying threats.  better was doubling the rooks on the c-file with Rc7 followed by Rbc8} 34. Rd7 Rcf8 35. Rxa7 h5 {this is one of those situations where you should sit tight and make your opponent prove that they can beat you.  by pushing the pawns by your king, it essentially weakens your defensive line, by making that line more accessible to your opponent} 36. Qd3+ Kg7 37. Qf3 g4 {exposing your king's defense even more, either Kg6, or Rh8 trying to hold things together would be recommended} 38. Qf5 Rbd8 {Rh8 holds on a bit longer} 39. a4 Rd1+ 40. Ka2 Re1 41. Qxh5 Rh8 {loses instantly} 42. Rxf7+ Kg8 43. Qg6+ Bg7 44. Qxg7# {Moral: keep it simple!  don't give up material without a very good reason (i.e. your queen), watch for golden opportunities, (winning the queen with Bg5), and when you're up on material, simplify by trading off your opponent's pieces, and go for the winning endgame.}
