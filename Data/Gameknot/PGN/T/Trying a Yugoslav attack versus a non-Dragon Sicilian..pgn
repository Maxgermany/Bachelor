1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {Book.} a6 {From what we see black play later, this move prevents Nb5 after e6.} 5. Nc3 {I thought about playing c4, but I had an interesting idea which I think still has merit.} e6 6. Bc4 {White is preparing a Yugoslav style attack, but Black is not playing the Dragon variation.  This was my idea, and I was really curious to see Black's real defenses against something simply not played as far as I know.   I searched through a database and there was only one game with players above 2000.  CM recommends Be2 to expedite castling.  Thanks for the line Ion, I purchased a work on the Sozin via ebay.  The author presents the Sozin as three interconnected systems framed largely around the white piece setup we see here .} Nf6 {CM expects White to exchange of Black's c6 knight at any moment.} 7. f3 {I was concerned with 7...Nxe4 8.Nxe4 d5!  Also, f3 is part of the yugoslav lines of the Dragon. } Qc7 {I felt that he was strongly discouraging me from going Queen-side.  Stubborn compunction;  There must be some merit in the idea because he is attempting to discourage it. } 8. Be3 {Played to prepare Qe2.} Bb4 {It doesn't seem possible to delay Nxc6 any longer.  I should probably allow the doubled pawn and castle kingside.} 9. Nxc6 Qxc6 {I expected the b pawn to recapture. } 10. Qd3 d5 {Excellent timing.} 11. O-O-O {A mistake based on an idea so strong, I played it immediately without checking alternative responses.  If black plays dxc4, then the game is over.  Unfortunately, the very strong (and probably obvious) response is played by Black.  I still think the idea might have merit, but the bishop safety must come first. } Qxc4 {CM: Score: -3.49  12.Bd4 Qxd3 13.cxd3 dxe4 14.fxe4 O-O 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Rhf1 Bd6 17.g3 Kg7 18.d4 Bd7 } 12. a3 {I felt that down a piece, I had to play actively and seek other compensation for the loss.  gh0stship stated that the remaining play felt stronger, so I must have found a few decent ideas.  I have two aims:  stop his development and promote my own.} Bxc3 13. Qxc4 {CM doesn't particularly like this move, but the idea was to remove his active pieces when Black is underdeveloped.} dxc4 14. bxc3 {I debated Bb6 first threatening mate, but decided to reclaim material first.  Looking back Bb6 was absolutely correct transposing to what was played, but he had a stronger alternative after this move order.} O-O {14...O-O is a small mistake as it allows my tactic which would have been halted by the simple 14...b5.} 15. Bb6 { } Nd7 {Score: -3.78  16.Bf2 Re8 17.Bg3 e5 18.Rd6 Nf8 19.Rhd1 f6 20.Bf2 Ne6 21.Be3 a5 22.Kb2 (Time = 0:41, Depth = 3/13)  } 16. Bd4 {I make e5 enevitable, but after seeing the prefered lines of the CM engine, I have to wonder if pressing Black into e5 was wise.} e5 { } 17. Be3 f5 18. exf5 Nf6 {Expected the Rook capture. } 19. g4 e4 {Expected b5.  While this isn't exactly a Yugoslav, it has enough similarities and his strength is the queen-side.} 20. g5 Nh5 21. fxe4 Re8 {I still liked preventing the QS mobilization now with Bb6 as I have already played once, but there are probably several good continuations to choose from.  White's only viable strategy is KS expansion, and he must consider his moves carefully. } 22. Bb6 { } g6 {Odd, but it will definitely diffuse my attack if I don't play accurately.} 23. fxg6 {I think Rhf1 was more accurate. } hxg6 24. Rhf1 Bg4 {Very few choices.} 25. Rd6 Re6 {I was really hoping to grab the g pawn.  Black's bishop prevents Rfd1.} 26. e5 {Delays the decision, but the exchange is the only option.  } Rae8 { } 27. Rd7 {I was so intent on doubling my rooks on the 7th rank that I overlooked his best response.  Much better was Rd8 forcing an even exchange when Rxb6 loses a rook.  CM suggested Bd4.} Rxb6 {I resigned here.  I needed the active piece.  Rf1f7 fails because g7 is protected.}
