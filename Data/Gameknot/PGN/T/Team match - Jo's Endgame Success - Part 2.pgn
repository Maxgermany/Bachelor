1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - the first four moves are standard moves of the Sicilian Defence.} e5 5. Nb5 d6 6. Nb1c3 a6 7. Na3 h6 {7. .......... h6 - over the last few moves the white knights have done a bit of a dance.  Next move I develop a piece with 8. Be3.} 8. Be3 Nf6 9. Nc4 {9. Nc4 - an aggressive outpost for my knight.  Black decides to develop rather than attack my knight with 9......... b5.} Be7 10. f3 O-O 11. Be2 Nd4 {11. ............ Nd4 - over the last few moves both sides have continued to develop.  Black overreaches himself here as this move is going to leave him bereft of a pawn.} 12. Bxd4 exd4 13. Qxd4 Nd7 14. Nd5 Bf6 {14. ........... Bf6 - after my aggressive 14. Nd5 black attacks the WQ with Bf6.  The IQP will now drop off.} 15. Nxf6+ Nxf6 16. Qxd6 b5 17. Qxd8 Rxd8 18. Ne3 {18. Ne3 - the queens have been swapped off, another black pawn has fallen and I now retreat my knight to e3.  This gives extra support to the d1 square.} Nh5 19. Rd1 Be6 20. Kf2 Nf4 21. Rxd8+ Rxd8 22. Rd1 Rxd1 23. Bxd1 Bxa2 {23. ......... Bxa2 - after a plethora of exchanges black wins back one of his pawns but I hang on to my pawn plus right into the endgame.} 24. Nf1 Bc4 25. Ng3 f6 26. Ne2 Ne6 27. g3 Bxe2 28. Bxe2 {28. Bxe2 - after a bit of pawn and piece positioning it now becomes another B v Kt endgame.} Nd4 29. Bd3 Kf7 30. Ke3 Nc6 31. c3 Ke6 {31. ....... Ke6 - both kings centralise themselves.  I next try and shore up the queenside.} 32. b4 g5 33. h3 h5 34. f4 {34. f4 - now comes an intricate piece of pawn play which will lead to my eventual victory.} Kd6 35. Be2 {35. Be2 - the h pawn is en prise.  Black misses this by playing 35....... Ne7? so I regain my 2 pawn advantage.} Ne7 36. Bxh5 gxf4+ 37. gxf4 Nc6 {37. .......... Nc6 - I now have a passer on the h file and this pawn will seal the victory for me.  Over the next two moves black shunts his steed from c6 to e7 while I amass my forces.} 38. Bg4 Ne7 39. h4 Nc6 40. h5 Ne7 41. h6 {41. h6 - passed pawns must be pushed!!} Ng6 42. h7 Kc6 {42. ........ Kc6 - defends the queenside pawns but I am not to be denied.  I now back up my h7 passer.} 43. Bf5 Nh8 44. Kd4 Nf7 {44. ......... Nf7 - black is reduced to shunting his knight between h8 and f7.} 45. e5 fxe5+ 46. fxe5 Nh8 47. c4 bxc4 48. Kxc4 {48. Kxc4 - another two pawns are exchanged.  The only potential mating material black now has is the a pawn.  Black moves his knight to f7 for the last time.} Nf7 49. e6 Nd6+ {49........... Nd6  - this knight fork wins the bishop on f5.  I now move my king to d3 out of range of any further spite checks from the steed.  Black cannot prevent h8/Q next move so he throws in the sponge.  Another much needed victory for my team!} 50. Kd3 {}
