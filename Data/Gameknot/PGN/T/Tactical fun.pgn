[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 c6 {Not exactly the best choice of moves by me as black, but I have this idea...} 2. c4 {And white wants to control the center so moves c4; but e4 is probably better.} b6 {I decide to give white some complications immediately, just to see how he'll handle them. So I moved b6. E6 or d5 would have been much better.} 3. Nc3 {A reasonable move, in keeping with controlling the center.} d5 {All of those other moves just so I can move d5 here. White still retains the advantage and tempo here.} 4. e4 {Now it is I who has a choice of what to do. I make the best move here.} dxe4 5. Nxe4 {My opponent firmly in the center, now I take a minute to decide what it is I wish to do. And I have a plan; I will castle, and try to prevent white from gaining more space while keeping the board has complicated as I can, which is not what I usually do, and then I'll look for a way to wrest the initiative away from white by causing as many threats as I can, if he doesn't keep me on the defensive. Most games, for those who've seen my annotated games, I try to squeak out a small advantage and turn it into a winning endgame. Not so this one! Soon the position will become very fun.} Nf6 6. Nxf6+ exf6 7. Be3 {This white choice is rather passive, and Fritz doesn't like it as much as developing the knight or moving the f pawn.} Bb4+ {I make the best move here, that Fritz likes. It forces white to admit that his seventh move was a mistake.} 8. Bd2 {Which he does admit, rather than move his king. Rather than trade Bishops, I decide to have a little fun first...} Qe7+ {Although not one of Fritz's top two choices, it is not a bad move to see how white will respond before trading bishops or castling. Plus, I don't absolutely have to trade bishops, although not doing so on my next turn may end up costing me a tempo.} 9. Ne2 {This move is not one of Fritz's favorites either, but it's no blunder. Better was the bishop, so the knight would have the f3 space available.} Bg4 {I did this rather intentionally, wanting the white f pawn on f3 instead of f4.} 10. f3 {White obliges.} Bh5 {Better was Be6 or Bd7. But I wanted either of two things: to provoke pawn advances on the Kingside, where the white king protection will prove weaker later, or failing that, to keep some pressure indirectly on that diagonal. Now whether or not that is wise in this position is debateable, and probably not such a good choice, since the bishop won't be really that active until things change. I am assuming white will castle kingside. You know what they say about making assumptions... ;)} 11. d5 {This is not the best choice by white either; better was trading bishops for white.} cxd5 {Very bad move by me here, allowing Qa4+. But white chooses something different...} 12. cxd5 {And of course I noticed Qa4 after we were already headed down that last sequence... so I wasted no time at all here...} Bd6 {Whew. Got away with one there. Not a good way to play, but in Blitz this happens. White still has a slight advantage here, but soon I hope to change that.} 13. Qa4+ {This comes too late. Perhaps white is subtly letting me know he saw this after he moved, and decided he'd do it anyways. But now Black has no issues defending one of various ways.} Nd7 14. O-O-O {...and this move really surprised me. Will it take white too long to get his king behind the pawns? Immediately I castle next...} O-O {And now it is black with a slight advantage according to Fritz.} 15. Nd4 {Now this is interesting to me, because white sees he can mount a threatening attack in the center. But does so before getting his King in a more safe position. Is it worth the risk?} Bg6 {After a brief think, I decide to see if I can keep the white king away from a1, thinking I'll be able to defend adequately.} 16. Nc6 {I thought about moving a rook to pin the knight here. But now the game is getting complicated, and I did not like the white bishop move to a6 followed by the h file rook moving to e1.Things might just end up getting simplified, but I want more. After thinking some, I decided to let my queen be chased a little.} Qe8 17. Bb5 {But instead of Re1, or other moves Fritz happened to like, white thinks to add his own pressure, but it's not real. The knight can still be pinned if but for a minute. And here I begin to see some interesting possibilities involving a queen sacrifice by me. I don't expect my opponent to miss it, but it will further complicate the board, and so I think, why not? Usually in Blitz I don't do that, because it's too easy to miss stuff. And of course, more accurate would be a6, leading to the eventual loss of the white d pawn, or worse for white. But it's Blitz, I don't think of that during this game, occupied with thoughts of creating interesting possibilities with discovered check on the white king. So instead...} Qc8 {Finally, white begins to think about his king protection and getting another threat going by advancing his pawns. He would do well to trade off a few pieces by Bb4, but chooses something else...} 18. h4 {There is better for black to do here, but I simply respond with...} h5 {It's funny; we are both missing the little things we can do to gain advantages around the a through d files, and are wasting time maneuvering on the f through h files here. That won't continue long. I really just wanted space for my bishop to retreat so I could keep that diagonal under pressure. I'm done messing over there; I don't even care if I lose that h pawn at this point, because doubled white pawns on the h file will take a while to become a threat, and will be weak besides.} 19. g4 {And now my attention is elswhere. I believe white doesn't have time to do anything good for himself over there, and so I begin to think again on what I can do to cause trouble for white's king after the brief distraction.} Nc5 {Fritz doesn't like this, but I am setting up something sneaky now that I first thought of around move 16..} 20. Qd4 {White responds here with the best move. One I thought he would, actually.} Be5 {Qxc5 was possible here, but white chooses something else, which still results in something similar. For the moment, white has forgotten about those g and h pawns.} 21. Ne7+ Kh8 {Better was Kh7, perhaps; but I wanted room for my light-squared bishop on h7.} 22. Nxc8 {And now I decide here, after having seen this position some moves ago, to take the knight with the rook. I should have used the a rook, but oh well.} Rfxc8 {White just saw me let him capture my queen. Fritz thinks best play results in a mostly even game here! This is because there are a LOT of complications and tactics in this position. I so love it. I really don't care if I lose here; it's the fun of chess that I enjoy, and usually I don't get into this kind of fun position. With best play by both sides, white comes out with a bit less than a pawn advantage... well for as far ahead as Fritzs sees in only a few minutes. But since this was a Blitz game, and I laid this 'trap' if you will a while back, I'm hoping white does not see that he must block the c file, or lose the game. White needs to do that with his queen or bishop of course; either way the white queen must be 'given back'. } 23. Qxe5 {Alas, white gets greedy and doesn't really look at the position. The mate in one is not hard to spot here, and I had been aware of nearly this exact position for some moves now, not expecting to see the opportunity to make the mate happen.} Nb3# {With the escape square covered, and two pieces delivering check, the king cannot escape. Although this game was filled with several minor errors, it was still fun to create a complicated position, and play it inasmuch as it was. Here's hoping you enjoyed the sharp positions!}
