1. d4 {I open with my queen pawn.} d5 2. c4 {Queens Gambit.} dxc4 {Black accepts the Queens Gambit. Rather unusual, I think it´s bad for Black.} 3. e4 {Gaining space in the center. You shall always do that if Black accepts the Gambit!} b5 4. a4 {Theory so far!} c6 5. axb5 cxb5 6. Nf3 Qb6 7. Nc3 Bb7 8. d5 Nd7 9. Be2 b4 {Threatening my knight!} 10. Na4 {Counterthreat against Blacks Queen.} Qc7 11. O-O {White castles kingside.} Ngf6 12. Qd4 {Rather aggressive move, this!} Ba6 13. g3 O-O-O {This move is to hazardous. Black castles queenside, too risky with removed pawns in front of the King! Not to recommend!} 14. Bf4 {Threatens Blacks Queen!} Qb7 15. Bxc4 {Gains a pawn! Now you can see the danger for Blacks King along the open c-file!} e5 {Tricky move.} 16. Qd3 {Was this retreat really necessary? When I look closer to the position, it seems like that I just could take the e-pawn there?} Bxc4 17. Qxc4+ Kb8 18. Nxe5 {Now I take the e-pawn.} Rc8 {Threatens my queen, but misses something essential!} 19. Nxd7+ {A discovered double-check! Wins a piece for free, but it will be worse for Black, much worse!} Ka8 20. Nab6+ {At first I didn´t saw this crushing move, but then I discovered it!} Qxb6 {Black must take with his queen!} 21. Qxc8+ {But it doesn´t help Black! Mate in one, can you see it?} Qb8 {Desperation!} 22. Qxb8# {I only takes the queen and now checkmate! Immediately after I finished this amazing game I thinked, I must annotate this game! As I can see, Black castled in the wrong direction, if he had castled kingside I think it had been a whole different story!}
