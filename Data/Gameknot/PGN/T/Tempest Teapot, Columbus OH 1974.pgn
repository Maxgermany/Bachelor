1. d4 {(I played this game back in high school and Dad thought it was good enough to submit to CL&R. They must have thought so too, because they published it. All annotations are from CL&R except those in parentheses).  It is astonishing how few players are prepared to face a counter gambit. Here White is radically unprepared and finds himself the victim of an elegant final combination. Notes based on those submitted by the winner's father, Harold W. Kohn.} Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ne4 {Speculative play, but it turns out to be a great investment.} 4. Nf3 d6 5. exd6 {Unwary. Playing against a gambit, it is better to develop one's own pieces, not the opponent's.} Bxd6 6. e3 Nc6 7. Qc2 Bf5 8. Qd1 {Instead of losing more time with the Queen, White should try Nc3.} Qf6 9. a3 {To prevent ... Bb4+} O-O-O 10. Nbd2 Nc5 11. Be2 Nd3+ 12. Bxd3 {Kf1 isn't much better, but now Black's Bishop ties up White completely.} Bxd3 13. Ra2 Rhe8 14. b4 Qg6 {What can White do? If Rg1 Rxe3+ 16. fe Qg3+ 17 hg Bxg3#. And if Nh4, the same combination works equally well. White's choice, however, is no better.  (White's only chance here was Nf1)} 15. g3 Rxe3+ 16. fxe3 Qxg3+ 17. hxg3 Bxg3# {Vividly illustrating the power of the two bishops.}
