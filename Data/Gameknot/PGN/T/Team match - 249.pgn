1. e4 {Here is a recent game in which I had a hard fought battle, with chances in the middlegame, only for my higher rated opponent to flex his muscles and take advantage.  In the end I managed to cling on for a draw.  But could I have done any better?} e6 {I play the French defence.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {Advanced variation} c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 {Exerting pressure on the centre and d4.} 5. Bd3 {My opponent develops his bishop and prepares for castling.  He also offers temporary pawn sac on d4.  } Qb6 {Which I decline.  } 6. a3 {To prevent Bb4+ at a later stage.  } cxd4 {I take his pawn on d4.  Now I am a pawn up for the time being and with a reasonable position. } 7. b4 {Limiting the squares for my dark-squared bishop and also enabling Bb2 perhaps.} Qc7 {I retreat to pressure e5 and maintain the attack in the centre.} 8. Bf4 f6 {I was quite pleased with this move.  It exerts further pressure on the centre and f6 is immune from capture by white's e pawn as this would allow Qxf4. } 9. Qe2 {The best move} g5 {Now I lash out.  But am I being too aggressive at the expense of my king? } 10. Bg3 g4 {The point of my previous move.  Now I am winning the pawn on e5.  } 11. Nfd2 Nxe5 {At this stage I was feeling quite pleased with myself.  I had a decent grip on the centre and was two pawns to the good.  I just needed to develop my remaining pieces, castle, and then relax, right?} 12. O-O Bd6 {Developing and breaking the pin.} 13. Nb3 Nc6 {I didn't mind returning the pawn on g4 with this move,} 14. Nb1d2 Nge7 15. Qxg4 e5 {Building on my central control and with a discovered attack on my opponent's queen.} 16. Qg7 Rf8 17. Rae1 e4 {At this point I thought I was doing well.  I just needed to develop my remaining minor piece, castle queen-side and push my central pawns up the board.} 18. Bxe4 {This was unexpected and I was now starting to worry about my king in the centre.} dxe4 {I accept the sacrifice.} 19. Nxe4 {Threatening Nxf6+.} Be5 {So I protect f6 and put another piece on the e-file.} 20. f4 {A good move.  It's at this point that the tide starts to turn.  If I play Bd6 then Nxf6+ and I lose the rook on f8. } Nd5 {So I played knight d5, trying to exchange queens to neutralise my opponent's threats.} 21. Qxc7 Nxc7 {If I recapture with my bishop then there is a nasty discovered check with Nxf6+, which picks up my knight on d5 next move.} 22. Nd6+ Ke7 23. fxe5 {Material is returned.} fxe5 {Now I think my opponent misses a trick.  Bh5+ picks up the exchange as I can no longer defend the rook on f8 with my king. } 24. Rxf8 {But he plays rxf8. } Kxf8 {I take.} 25. Nc5 {He is in no hurry to take my pawn on e5. } b6 26. Nd3 Ba6 {Trying to develop that bishop (finally!)} 27. Nxe5 {He takes on e5} Nxe5 {I take} 28. Rxe5 {He takes with the rook.} Ne8 {Aiming to simplify through exchanges.} 29. Rd5 Rd8 {Getting my rook into the game.} 30. Rxd4 {But now I have lost another pawn and it is looking a bit grim.} Nxd6 {So I try to liquidate. } 31. Bxd6+ {Recapturing with the bishop.} Kf7 32. Be5 {Breaking the pin.} Rxd4 {I figure I have more drawing chances with the rooks off and an opposite coloured bishop ending.  Although I am two pawns down.} 33. Bxd4 {My opponent recaptures.} Ke6 {Moving my king to the centre} 34. Kf2 {My opponent does the same} Kf5 35. a4 Bc4 {Making my bishop a bit more active.} 36. b5 Bd5 {Trying to set up Be4, then Bc2 threatening the pawn on a4. } 37. a5 {But my opponent pushes on.  Now I have a choice.  Do I take on a5 or on b5 after my next move?} Bc4 {I decide to go for b5.  Otherwise I allow my opponent connected passed pawns.} 38. axb6 {He takes} axb6 {I recapture} 39. Bxb6 {He takes again} Bxb5 {I take.  Now I just need to cling on. } 40. g3 h5 {Getting my pawn on a light square and up the board.  } 41. h4 Ke4 {Centralising my king with a view to blockading the c pawn. } 42. Bc7 Bd7 {At this point I offered a draw.  } 43. Ke2 {Which my opponent declined.} Kd4 44. Kd2 Bf5 45. c3+ Kc4 {But it is hard to see how he can make any progress.  My king has made it to blockade the c pawn and white cannot advance on the queenside.  } 46. Be5 Be6 47. Ke3 Bg4 {The bishop comes in to lock-up the position.  } 48. Kf4 {And at this stage my opponent offered a draw which I accepted.  Phew!  An interesting game and one where I was probably lucky in the end.  I had my chances and perhaps could have held it better in the middlegame.  However, overall I was happy with the result.  Look forward to receiving and comments. }
