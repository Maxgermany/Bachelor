[Opening "Queen's pawn game, Krause variation (D02)"]

1. d4 {The queen pawn openings are the 2nd most popular openings behind king pawn.  1. d4 establishes a center pawn and prevents an early e5 reply from black.  The most notable characteristic is that the center pawn is protected from the beginning by the queen, unlike 1. e4.} d5 {2...d4 and 2...Nf6 are the most popular responses, both preventing 2. e4 (which would give white a strong pawn center).} 2. Nf3 {2. c4 is the most common continuation, attempting to remove black's center pawn with a flanking pawn.  However, Nf3 is also sound, further influencing the central squares and remaining flexible.} c5 {I often play an early c5, for the same reasons that white would play 2. c4.  I don't know how sound it is, but I've had good luck so far.} 3. dxc5 {By taking the pawn, white gives up influence in the center.  As white already has a knight on f3, e5 can't be played immediately, but black intends to advance it as soon as possible.} Nc6 {Preparing for 4. e5.} 4. g3 e5 {Black's uncontested central pawns will influence the course of the game.} 5. Bg2 {A hypermodern staple, fianchettoed bishops are strong and influence the central squares from a distance.  Fianchetto itself means "little flank" in Italian.  The goal of a hypermodern opening is usually to delay occupying the central squares with pieces and try to destroy or undermine the opponent's center.  } Bxc5 {Recapturing the pawn while developing the bishop to a strong diagonal, attacking the weak f2 pawn.} 6. O-O Nge7 {Nge7 was played to avoid complications with 7. Bg5.} 7. e3 {!? (Dubious move).  This seems to have been played to prevent d4 and take pressure off of the a7-g1 diagonal.  However, it weakens the white squares on the kingside and traps the dark bishop.  Any developing move would be better.} Bg4 {Taking advantage of the weakened d1-h5 diagonal to pin the knight.  Threatening to win the knight with e4.} 8. Nc3 {? (Bad move).  Something needed to be done to address the pinned knight, either by moving the queen or advancing the h pawn to threaten the attacking bishop.} e4 {Winning the knight.} 9. b3 {Perparing to develop the dark squared bishop, which is trapped by the e pawn.  A fianchettoed bishop is strong, expecially one pointing at the king, but again, the pinned knight needs to be addressed.} Ne5 {Adding pressure to the unfortunate knight.  There's no need to take it as the pin still hasn't been addressed.} 10. h3 {Finally forcing action.} Bxf3 {Nxf3  was considered, but ultimately abandoned as I couldn't find a good reply to 11. Kh1.} 11. Bxf3 Nxf3+ {The knight has a strong outpost as it can't be attacked by pawns and is protected by the e pawn.  Kasparov once said that a knight on the 6th (or 3rd) rank is equal to a rook.} 12. Kg2 {This is better than Kh1 as it protects the h3 pawn and allows the rook to move to h1 if needed.} O-O 13. Bb2 {This fiachettoed bishop is extremely strong as black has given up the central dark squares, allowing the bishop to peer all the way across the board and into the black castle.} a6 {Preventing Kb5 and allowing a retreat for the c5 bishop if needed (if 14. Na4, for example).  I want to maintain influence over d4 to prevent a possible Qd4 in the future.} 14. h4 {?! (Dubious move).  h4 further weakens the white squares around the king.} Ng6 {Giving up the d5 pawn (15. Nxd5), to attack the king.  Looking at 15...Ngxh4  16. gxh4 Qxh4 (Nxg4?! seems to lead to trouble as it opens up the d1-h5 diagonal for white's queen).} 15. Nb1 {? (Bad move).  This appears to be in preparation for Nd2, contesting the knight on f3.  However, it's almost never a good idea to retreat a piece to it's original square.  It loses time, obstructs other pieces, and gives up influence.  Ne2 followed by Ng1 or Nd4 would have been better.  Also, Nxd5 is available as mentioned last move.} Ngxh4+ {This sacrifice may not be completely sound, but I was up a piece already, so giving material back doesn't hurt me, especially when it's used to destroy the king's protective pawns.} 16. gxh4 Qxh4 17. Rh1 {Forced, to avoid mate or further loss of material.} Qg4+ 18. Kf1 Nh2+ {Sets a trap:  19. Rxh2? Qxd1 .} 19. Ke1 Nf3+ 20. Kf1 {Ke2 may have been slightly better.  It would link the rook and queen and allow the king to eventually move to c1.} Rad8 {Perparing to advance my d pawn and open up the center.} 21. Nd2 {Contesting my knight.  If my knight were removed, white could counter with Rg1, taking advantage of the half-open g file and fianchettoed bishop on b2.} d4 22. Nxf3 dxe3 {Discovered attack on the queen.} 23. Nd4 {! (Good move)  I expected white to move his queen, giving me time to recapture the knight, so this caught me by surprise.  I can't recapture the knight without addressing my hanging queen, and can't trade queens without giving up my attack and allowing white to equalize (Qxd1 24. Rxd1, after which I can't recapture the knight).} Qf4 {! (Good move).  Threatens mate in 1, forcing a reply, and maintains the pin on the knight.} 24. f3 {!? (Interesting move)  White thought Qe1 or Qe2 was too weak and looked for a better reply.  This certainly appears to defend the knight, but 24. Qe2 Bxd4 (exf2 25. Qxf2 Qxf2 26. Kxf2 Bxd4  27. Bxd4 Rxd4 28. Ke3) 25. Bxd4 Rxd4 26. Qxe3 Qxe3 27. fxe3 Rd2 28. Ke1 e3 may be slightly better.  At this point, trading down to an endgame loses for white because of black's passed pawns, but allowing connected passed pawns here spells disaster.} Bxd4 {Black needs to remove the knight before playing exf3 as 25. Qxf3 Qxf3 26 Nxf3 gains nothing.} 25. Bxd4 exf3 26. Qc1 {Better is c3, protecting the bishop.  Bxe3 Rxd1  27. Rxd1 Qxe3 is worse because the check prevents recapture of black's queen.} Rxd4 27. c3 Rd2 {Confining white's king to the back rank and preparing a series of mate threats.} 28. Qb1 {A surprise attack, looking at 29. Qxh7#.} Rh2 29. Rg1 {Here are a couple of lesser possibilities: 29. Kg1 Qg3  30. Kf1 Rxh1# 29. Rxh2 Qxh2 followed by ...Qh1# (30. Qxh7  Kxh7 would delay mate a turn, but change nothing).} Qh4 {White can delay with checks, but black has too many choices.  In particular, e2  or Qf2  win against almost anything.} 30. Qe1 e2+ {Another possibility is Rf2  31. Qxf2 Qxf2#, but I find perverse pleasure in mating with a pawn.} 31. Qxe2 fxe2# {1-0  Please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes.}
