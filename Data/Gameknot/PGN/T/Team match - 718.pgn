[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {Switch it up with a queen opening as opposed to my usual king's opening.} d5 {counter} 2. Nf3 {Protecting the lone pawn out and starting the castle process} e6 {he protects as well, but with a pawn.} 3. Nc3 {Pulling out the other knight.} h6 4. g3 {creating a bishop line} Bd6 5. e4 {the fight for the middle } dxe4 6. Nxe4 {obvious} Nf6 {i could have gone either way, i reallllly don't like bishops.} 7. Nxd6+ {takes with pawn} cxd6 8. a3 {a little air, and trying to break that stagnant line up} a6 9. Bd3 {castle coming, i put my man the bishop right in the middle.} d5 10. O-O {the castle I wanted.} Nc6 11. Re1 {future move for e6. It does pan out, and pans out big.} Qd6 12. Bf4 {how dare you bring your queen out?} Qe7 {Thats right, sucka. I contemplated bishop to f5 knowing he wouldn't do it or else lose the queen. queen and bishop isn't always a good trade for a queen, but I was willing here. Instead I found a better move, moving the knight in.} 13. Ne5 Nxd4 {Yes, dude, it's a free pawn, but your knight is completely unprotected.} 14. Ng6 {Attacks the queen, he probably thinks thats he getting a knight for a pawn, but he forgot about leaving that knight wide open} fxg6 15. Bxg6+ {his check forces him to move. I knew he wouldn't cover with the queen, and I knew he couldn't come closer with his king (the only way would be on the diagonal)} Kf8 {Wow, dangerous to angle your king behind a queen on a diagonal. I wish I would have had protection on d6 for the pin.} 16. Qxd4 {I ended up  1 on the deal he thought he would be  2 on} b5 {Sure I'll fill your gap.} 17. Qb6 Ne8 {King protection.} 18. Qc6 {Working the diagonal line on the rook.} Ra7 {Not sure, I think he thought my queen would be trapped in deeper than it really was?} 19. Qxc8 {I don't see the trap. In hindsight, I don't believe there was one.} Qd7 {He wants to trade queen after his screw up, but.....} 20. Qc5+ {He leaves a  very nice line open.} Qe7 {"Oh man, I really screwed up, now trade me queens??" } 21. Rxe6 {Great move opened up, he does see it and resigns. If he went for my queen, rook to e8 would have been mate.}
