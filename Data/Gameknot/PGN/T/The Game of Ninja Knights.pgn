1. e4 {Yes, I seriously am calling it that. You will see why throughout the game. Both players use their Knights with great skill, and the only reason that it turned out the way it did was because of those Knights.} c5 2. Bc4 g6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Ng5 e6 5. d3 Bh6 {I was trying something new here. I am unsure of the actual accuracy of this move, but I wanted to mix things up a bit.} 6. Nh3 Bxc1 7. Qxc1 Nf6 8. O-O a6 9. Qh6 {White clearly has the better position.} b5 10. Bb3 Bb7 11. Qg7 Rg8 12. Qh6 Qc7 13. Ng5 O-O-O {The wrong move in this case.} 14. Nxf7 Rdf8 {A case of the wrong Rook.} 15. Ng5 Nh5 {A big blunder.} 16. Nxe6 dxe6 17. Bxe6+ Kd8 18. Bxg8 Rxg8 {So you see where White used his Knight to gain the advantage.} 19. Qg5+ Kc8 20. Qxc5 Ne5 21. Qxc7+ Kxc7 {White should win this...} 22. Nc3 Nf4 23. g3 Nf3+ 24. Kh1 {My Knight rade has begun.} Ne6 25. Nd5+ Bxd5 26. exd5 Nc5 27. Kg2 Rf8 28. Rad1 Na4 29. b3 Nc3 30. Rda1 Kd6 31. a4 b4 32. h4 Kxd5 33. Rfh1 h5 34. Rh3 {He traps his Rook in.} Nd4 35. Rc1 Rc8 36. Kf1 Nce2 37. Re1 Rxc2 {I'm slowly recovering material.} 38. g4 Nf4 39. Rg3 Nxb3 40. gxh5 gxh5 41. Rg5+ Kc6 42. Rf5 Nd2+ 43. Kg1 Nf3+ 44. Kf1 Nxe1 {My Knights have served their purpose.} 45. Rxf4 Nxd3 46. Rf5 b3 {He resigns when he realizes that the pawn cannot be stopped. The game was titled this way for a reason, and it once more shows why Knights are my favorite Minor piece over Bishops.}
