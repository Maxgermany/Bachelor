1. e4 {I joined this game as black and set some conditional moves just for the beginning. If 1. d4 then 1...Nf6  If 1.e4 then 1...c5. Pretty standard moves and my favorite replies. However I entered something incorrectly...} b5 {?! Whoops! I came back to the game later and saw a '-1' next to it in my list and was very confused. After I realized what happened I decided to defend my heart out.} 2. Bxb5 Bb7 3. d3 e6 4. Nf3 c5 {There are (obviously) very few games in the world or on Gameknot that follow my response, therefore I'm just trying to make some good common sense moves. I need to stake my claim to the center but don't want to restrict my fianchettoed bishop, so 4...c5 seemed like a good move. } 5. O-O Qb6 {Hoping to harass the bishop and try to get some counter play. Other than being down a pawn the position is not so bad yet. } 6. Bc4 Nf6 7. Nbd2 a5 {Thinking of possibly playing a4 and d4, trapping the bishop. } 8. a3 Be7 9. Ba2 {How many times has he moved that piece..?} d6 10. Nc4 Qc7 11. Bf4 Nbd7 12. e5 {Whoops, am I in trouble? } dxe5 13. Ncxe5 Bd6 14. Nxd7 Qxd7 15. Bxd6 Qxd6 {Get through it. I don't mind my position so much now. My queen is active and the bishop strikes right at White's King. Maybe not a bad gambit...} 16. h3 Qf4 17. Qe2 Bxf3 {Decide to double the f-pawns which will put us on comparatively even ground. If I can win the pawn back, then I'll have the better position even! This move turns out to be crucial in to Black's win.} 18. Qxf3 Qxf3 19. gxf3 Rb8 20. b4 cxb4 21. axb4 {Ahah, now I can even the pawn count....} Rxb4 {In my haste I recaptured incorrectly. A shame, but being down a pawn hasn't really hurt me so far...} 22. Bc4 a4 23. c3 Rb6 24. Rxa4 O-O {Finally castling. } 25. Rfa1 Nh5 26. Ra4a8 Nf4 27. Rxf8+ Kxf8 28. Kh2 Rb2 29. Kg3 g5 30. Ra2 Rxa2 31. Bxa2 Nxd3 {Now the pawns are even, and white has the doubled f's to deal with. However the passed c-pawn could be trouble. My knight is consumed by blocking it for awhile. } 32. Bb1 Nc5 33. Bxh7 {White is back up a pawn} f5 {or is it another gambit! I hoped that I could trap the bishop, but can't quite get to it in time. I can however keep it trapped over in the side for a little and bring my king into action in the meantime. } 34. Bg6 Ke7 35. Bh5 f4+ 36. Kg4 Kf6 37. h4 gxh4 38. Kxh4 Nd3 39. c4 e5 {The pawn on f2 may look appealing, but worring about the passed pawn later will not be worth it, besides, where's it going? } 40. Be8 Kf5 41. Bd7+ Kf6 42. Bc6 {Somewhere around here I offered my opponent a draw. With precise play I think that's all White can achieve, even with the pawn. The knight can stop the advance meanwhile the White king should stay put to stop black from infiltrating. cbarb declined my draw offer and played on...} Nc5 43. Be4 Nb3 44. Kh3 Kg5 {If he's going to let me in, I'll surely oblige. } 45. Kg2 Kh4 46. Bf5 Nd4 47. Be4 Nb3 48. Kf1 {Now the c-pawn falls and suddenly White is on the defensive...} Nd2+ 49. Ke2 Nxc4 50. Kd3 Nd6 51. Bd5 Kh3 52. Be6+ {One move too late. } Kg2 {Trouble brewing.} 53. Ke2 Nb5 {A good knight move, there are many dangerous squares for it to go to now, and they're all black! } 54. Bg4 Nd4+ 55. Ke1 Nxf3+ {This is a mistake. Black gets into some trouble after 56. Ke2 Nd4  57. Kd3 ... White starts to move in to Black's pawns, which he desperately needs and can draw! 55... e4 seals the deal much more effectively. } 56. Ke2 Nd4+ 57. Ke1 {Luckily for me my opponent was too caught up in defending the f pawn to notice. } e4 {That's better. } 58. Bc8 {There are a lot of good lines for Black here, but I decide to go for something flashy and give my opponent my knight if he wants it...} Nc2+ 59. Kd2 Kxf2 60. Kxc2 e3 {Black is destined to promote a pawn...White resigns. }
