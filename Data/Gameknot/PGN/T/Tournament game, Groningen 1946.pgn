1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 c5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. e3 Nc6 7. Bc4 {When seen against White's 11th move B-Q3, this seems to be a loss of tempo, but if White plays 7 B-Q3, Black need not exchange on QB6. } Nxc3 {Black should have delayed this exchange as long as possible.} 8. bxc3 cxd4 9. exd4 {After 9 BPxP B-N5 ch 10 B-Q2 BxB ch 11 QcB O-O 12 O-O P-QN3 Black has a very comfortable game.} Be7 10. O-O O-O 11. Bd3 {A better move was 11 Q-K2. } b6 12. Qc2 g6 {The continuation 12... P-KR3? 13 Q-K2 B-N2 14 Q-K4 costs Black a Pawn.} 13. Bh6 Re8 14. Bb5 {With this move White achieves the advance P-QB4, thus preventing the blockade of his hanging Pawns, but at the cost of exchanging his very active Bishop.} Bb7 15. c4 a6 16. Bxc6 Bxc6 17. Ne5 Rc8 18. Qb2 Ba8 19. Rac1 {White now has only slight prospects of an attack against Black's King and must keep his hanging Pawns covered.} b5 {This decides the game strategically. } 20. c5 Qd5 {A better continuation is 20... B-Q4, after which Black can post his Q on QN2 and use his Q-side majority.} 21. f3 f6 {Black wants to cut off the B on his KR3, but there is little logic in this plan. His two B's and blockade of the Q pawn give him a positional advantage, therefore it was unjustifiable to allow tactical complications.} 22. Ng4 Red8 23. Rfd1 g5 24. Ne3 Qc6 25. h4 {Black's faulty play on the 21st move already makes itself felt, although he still has the better position.} Qe8 26. hxg5 fxg5 27. Ng4 Qg6 28. Rde1 Bf6 29. Rcd1 Rd5 {A blunder that leads to a quick loss. After 29...B-KR1 or even 29... B-Q4 the position remains complicated, but in my opinion Black has the better prospects.} 30. Rxe6 Bxd4+ 31. Qxd4 {Black had overlooked this move. If 31... RxQ 32 RxQ ch he loses a piece, and after 31... QxR??? 32 Q-N7 mate. So Black resigns.}
