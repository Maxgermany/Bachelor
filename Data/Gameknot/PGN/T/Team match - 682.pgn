1. f4 {very different opening from what i have seen usually } d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 a6 4. Be2 Nc6 5. b3 Bf5 6. Bb2 Nb4 7. d3 h6 8. h3 e6 9. a3 Nc6 10. O-O Be7 11. Nbd2 Qd7 12. Qe1 Bc5 13. d4 Be7 14. Bd3 Rg8 {might look like a foolish and unnecessary move but it was the plan !!  later u will see how the rook file opens up } 15. Ne5 Nxe5 16. dxe5 Nh7 17. Bxf5 exf5 18. Nf3 g5 {now u know wat i mean  } 19. Rc1 g4 20. hxg4 Rxg4 {this makes it easy for me as all i have to do is castle and double up my rook to cause a threat } 21. b4 O-O-O 22. c4 Rdg8 23. Qe2 {a mistake for a long time i contemplated that i must go for the queen in exchange for two rooks but then decided not to hoping for a better position but then i make a blunder in the latter stages } h5 24. cxd5 Qxd5 25. Rfd1 Qe4 {this is the blunder } 26. Ne1 {my queen is stuck there } b5 {pawn move to prevent the podr rook from coming and also to free some space for the queen } 27. Rd4 Qb7 28. Rd2 Nf8 {making the knight free as it will be very crucial to support the c file pawn which can be attacked by the two rooks of white after doubling } 29. Rdc2 {as expected } Ne6 30. Rc2c6 {nice move to block out movement of my queen but a trap in disguise} h4 {watch the trap now } 31. Kh2 {making king come down and make the white think that black is helpless and queen cannot be freed  } Kb8 {another attempt to show the helplessness as a trap } 32. Qd3 {trying to get the white queen in action } Nd8 {a good move laying out the perfect trap .. white ideally should have gone back  wid rook c6-c2 but goes for a lure of a free pawn } 33. Rc6xc7 {just wht i wanted and the game is over as rook into g2.. eventually leading to checkmate will leave that for u to figure out  how !!!!1  by far one of the best  games i have played ....  and a worthy opponent in the form of joop !!!} Rg4xg2+ {}
