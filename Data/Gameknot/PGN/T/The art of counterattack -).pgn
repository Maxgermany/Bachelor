[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation (D00)"]

1. d4 {A blitz with a strong opponent that provided some hopes of a counterattack, maybe interesting. } d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. Nbd2 Nf6 5. e3 Nh5 {Fine until here. Now black attacks. } 6. h3 {I found a way to avoid to lose plainly the dsb. I could have moved it to g3, so the exchange compensates me with the semiopen h column, but I tried this (for me) new idea. } Bxf3 7. Qxf3 Nxf4 8. Qxf4 {Black is solid, but white is a little ahead in developement. Not that bad...} e6 9. Bb5 {Not really necessary, but not bad. } Bd6 10. Qg4 {The queen must be careful, but has plenty of action on the naked kingside. } O-O 11. f4 {Taking space and contesting a possible e5, but overseeing...} Nb4 {! It is difficult for white to defend. } 12. Ba4 b5 13. Bb3 a5 {I tried the same trick than before, but it is not so good now. } 14. c3 Nd3+ 15. Ke2 Nxb2 {I lose a pawn, but solve my castling problem, and I have an open semicolumn to work with. } 16. Rab1 Nc4 {Nothing better for black, as forseen. } 17. Nxc4 dxc4 18. Bc2 {Now, my bishop's mobility is restricted, and a pawn storm is coming from the west... but hey, do I have something of my own to exploit?} c6 19. Qh5 {Staring here, to provoke an advance that will favour me. } g6 20. Qf3 {Freeing the way for my h pawn, while threatening c6.} Qb6 {The best square?} 21. h4 {Am I not worried about the storm? well... the best strategy, here, seems to be... not to lose time over there! :-)} b4 22. h5 {...of course. } c5 {The pawn is pinned to the queen, so I can even let it advance...} 23. hxg6 {...but here is not sunny, too...} fxg6 24. Qh3 {Forking to good pawns. } Rf7 {Qxd6 can be good, but I cannot afford to lose any tempo, so...} 25. Bxg6 {The bishop can't be taken, or mate. } Rg7 {Hard to say how to proceed. Qxd6 seems good, but I can't see any definitive way out of the situation, so I especulated as much as I could. } 26. Bxh7+ Kf7 27. Qh5+ {abandoning d6, and miscalculating a little. } Ke7 28. Be4 {This is not a good move, but the bishop belogs to here, as the rook will get into the game. } Rag8 {Here, probably, I missed d5 as the only good defensive move. Black can sac an exchange on g2 happily. } 29. Rh2 {Not good, as Rg1 would have been better so to eventually support an advance. And the battery on the h file is useless!} cxd4 30. Qh4+ Kd7 31. exd4 {...so to defend f4 for one more move. But there is no hope for white, since the black king escapes to the queenside and white can't avoid it. } Rg7g4 32. Qh7+ Rg8g7 {Here I blundered, I simply got confused trying to find something, and played the "if" line...} 33. d5 Rxh7 34. dxe6+ Kxe6 35. Rxh7 {Nonsense, but the game is lost anyway. } Bxf4 36. Rf1 Qe3+ 37. Kd1 Qd2# {}
