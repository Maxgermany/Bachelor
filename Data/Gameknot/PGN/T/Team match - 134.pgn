1. d4 d5 {Queen's pawn.} 2. c3 Nc6 3. Nf3 {Book.} Nf6 {Book.} 4. h3 {This move generally bodes well for black.  White seems to get a very slight advantage with Bf4 instead. } Ne4 {Off database.} 5. g4 e5 6. Nxe5 Qh4 {:) Going for an early kill.} 7. Rh2 {Bd6 looks interesting.} Bd6 {Right on.  White will want to move the rook to g2, or black will play Pf6 and dine on horse.} 8. Nd2 {Horse meat is served.} f6 9. Nxc6 Bxh2 10. Nxe4 dxe4 11. e3 bxc6 12. d5 Bg1 {Black threatens checkmate again.} 13. Qe2 cxd5 14. b4 a5 15. Ba3 Ba6 16. b5 Bb7 17. Kd2 c6 18. bxc6 Bxc6 19. c4 dxc4 20. Qxc4 {O-O-O+ would be fun, though maybe not as much fun as QxPf2+.  Still how often does one get to check by castling?  With QxPf2+ white might interpose the bishop, but then QxPe3+ works--sort of a repeat performance.} Rc8 21. Qc5 {White's turn to threaten checkmate.} Qxf2+ 22. Kc3 {QxPe3+ forces a trade of queens.  Even exchanges are generally recommended when one enjoys a six point (or seven point with Pe3) material advantage.} Bb7 {But this move is much sweeter.  Queen for rook.  White will want to trade on black's 8th rank to keep the h rook in the corner.  } 23. Qxc8+ Bxc8 24. Bc5 Kf7 25. Bc4+ Be6 {Here Bb3 might be better.  BxB, PxB, and black must defend against RxPa5.} 26. Bxe6+ Kxe6 27. Kb3 Rc8 28. Bd4 Bh2 {Oh, I like Qc2+.  That leaves us 29. Ka3, Rc3+ 30 BxRc3, QxBc3+, 31. Ka4, Qb4#. But let's see what happens.} 29. Rb1 {Not good at all.  Rb8+ gives black a free rook.  Then again, so does Qc2+.} Qc2+ {Ok, the quickest route I see is 30. Ka3, Bd6+ 31. Bc5 Bxc5+ 32. Rb4 Paxb4#.  You could do it with the queen, but send in the little guy.  They almost never get to commit regicide. } 30. Ka3 Qxb1 31. h4 {Bb2 would be a delaying tactic.} Qb4# {}
