1. d4 Nf6 2. e3 g6 3. Bd3 Bg7 4. f4 {Never seen this before. I'm not sure if this is good or unwise for white (would have made more sense for e3 to be on e4 I think), but it does increase kingside pressure.} O-O 5. Nf3 d5 {Holding the e4 square for the time being.} 6. Nbd2 b6 7. O-O c5 8. c3 Nbd7 {I'm really not sure about this move. I think Nc6 would have been better (doesn't block in the bishop), but as I wanted my bishop on b7 if I could manage to clear the diagonal, I didn't want to block it in for the future. Shouldn't be making plans whilst the position is like this though :S} 9. Ne5 {I really want to relieve kingside pressure now, especially in light of possible pawn advances.} Nxe5 {The knight exchange is not really because the exchange was beneficial in itself, so much as freeing up my bishop again.} 10. fxe5 Nd7 {But having been forced back here, it really hasn't achieved much :-(  White has a clear initiative and pressure advantage now, and black is definitely on the back foot.} 11. Nf3 f5 {Either to lock the kingside or get counter play if an en-passant capture is played.} 12. exf6 e.p. exf6 {I chose this as I think Rxf6 would leave the rook vulnerable to too many minor piece and pawn combinations, and it doesn't have much useful manoeuvrability  at this stage. The bishop was definitely an option, but I wanted the ability to attack the e3 pawn in the long run, so I chose to go with opening up the e file instead.} 13. e4 Bb7 {Now my bishop can prove useful on this diagonal.} 14. exd5 Bxd5 15. Nh4 {Can only be preparing 16. Nxg6 hxg6 17. Bxg6. Torn now between f5 to protect the capture and attack the knight with my queen, or starting a counter-offensive of my own.} cxd4 {Opted for the counter-offensive, if cxd4 then f5 becomes quite strong as it attacks both the knight and the d4 pawn (which would also result in a useful check ...)} 16. Nxg6 {Ah, white ignored it - I hadn't considered this.} hxg6 17. Bxg6 {Material advantage, but horribly exposed king. I need activation and counter-play as soon as I can get it. I'm looking at a threatened Qh5, so attacking the bishop would be useful.} Ne5 18. Bc2 {Retreating the bishop -- wow, this game is sharp. Looking at Bxg2 to return material, and after Kxg2 Qd5  I get more possibilities for counter-play. Of course, I'd rather keep the material advantage.  } dxc3 19. Qh5 {Hmmm, seems to be threatening Bh7 , hard to see how to refute it. I'd like to get my Queen into the defence, so I'm going to go with Qe8 on the offchance of a Queen exchange.} Qe8 20. Qh7+ {Ah, how obvious. Now there are a lot of weaknesses in my position.} Kf7 21. Bg5 {Obvious, and rather cute -- It is vital to keep the knight on e5, yet if I move to the e file it can be skewered by a rook. This is horrible.} Ke6 22. Bf5+ Kd6 23. Qxg7 fxg5 24. bxc3 {Material advantage is still mine, but the position is just horrible.} Qe7 {Again hoping for a queen exchange, but why oh why did I not play Rf7.} 25. Qh6+ Qf6 {Chose against Rf6 here because of the loss of the pawn.} 26. Qh7 Rf7 {Now white seems to have lost momentum, and I can try to get the king to safety.} 27. Qh3 {I really need to get to get the queen of the f file whilst the white rook is on f1, but my King needs getting to safety first. I cannot travel to f8 with my rook on a8, and I need to avoid all the white squares. Kc7 is possible, but I'd rather activate my a8 rook and maintain initiative.} Rh8 28. Qg3 {Ah, this is foolish. Now Ke6 and Kc7 are caused problems by Rfe1 or Rae1. Having the knight skewered is awkward to say the least. Ke7 would have been better than 27... Rh8 by a long shot --} Re8 {What a waste of tempo, and I cannot retreat to e7 without losing the rook's protection of the knight.} 29. Rad1 {Oh dear, everything has fallen apart again. Now c4 will simply lose the bishop.} Rfe7 {Trying for Qf7, but playing with fire, the game is lost now.} 30. Be4 {Hmmm... with the discovered attack on the queen this is probably even better than c4. Tempted to play Qe6 and take the bishop queen for bishop rook, but it is likely to be losing. I have one last tactical attempt to try.} Qxf1+ {Hoping he takes with the rook.} 31. Kxf1 {The final nail.} Rf8+ 32. Kg1 {Well finished, nothing for black to do now.  Game annotation for team benefit --}
