1. f4 {At last I have a bit of time for another annotation. I choose to annotate this one as it was my first game as white in the tournament, and a very enjoyable game, not least for the forced mate-in-8 at the end. Again, starting at move 7.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ {The starting position.} Nxg4 {Blacks obvious move.} 8. Be6+ Kc6 {Kc6 seems the most popular choice here,} 9. Bxg4 {Up to here is standard stuff - white has to take the knight or there is simply not enough compensation for the queen.} e5 {And now the battle commences. As black, I play to exchange in an attempt to make my material advantage count more as the game goes on, therefore as white I'd rather avoid exchanges. As white, It seems I need to find a balance between developing my pieces whilst trying to keep black restricted at the same time.} 10. Nf7 {Forking queen and rook, though I'm not interested in the rook as I don't think I can afford to lose one of my two active pieces. I'm more interested in getting it into a better position.} Qf6 11. Nxe5+ {Capturing the pawn with tempo, and getting my knight better placed.} Kb6 12. Nc3 {Developing is vital if white is to stand a chance against blacks stronger army. Threatens d5+, and indirectly protects the f-pawn.} c6 {Giving the king a retreat option, and covering d5 but blocking c6 from the knight.} 13. d4 {Preparing to develop the bishop, which also now covers f4. If back wants the d-pawn that's fine by me.} Bb4 {Pins the knight and clears space for the h8 rook.} 14. a3 {I don't mind exchanging here, even at the expense of doubled pawns. It'll give the d-pawn some protection, remove his DSB (my king is on a black square, and would remain so if I castled.), half open the b-file for my rook (opposite his king), and give a1-h8 diagonal options for my DSB. Only downside is I can't pick off the d-pawn, but I'm happy for that to stay there - it blocks his rook from my king.} Bxc3+ 15. bxc3 Re8 16. O-O {My knight is safe at the mo. No point in Rb1+ yet as he'll probably escape to c7, where I have no chance of an attack yet, so whilst things are fairly under control, king away and rook out opposite queen.} h5 17. Bh3 {I expected this at some point, but that's as far as he can get for now so the bishop is still safe on the h3-c8 diagonal, and I'd like to keep c8 and d7 unavailable for the king, and keeping the b8 knight at bay, thus blocking that other rook too. If the b8 knight comes out to a6 then it has nowhere else to go from there. (I'd love to get the f1 rook down to f7, then do something involving the other rook to b1 and the LSB onto f1 for the f1-a6 diagonal but can't see a way of achieving it yet.)} Rd8 {That doesn't help with getting the Knight out so is he looking at ...e6 with designs on my d pawn?} 18. Be3 {Easily defended, with potential for a discovered check. The f pawn is also protected by the Rf8.} Kc7 19. Rad1 {Psychologically this feels good to me. All my pieces are involved. Black still has 2 pieces at home, and a queen with not much scope for action. Of course, I can't stop ...Nd7 now, as I can only win the exchange not a whole piece, and I'd rather not lose 2 active pieces for 2 inactive pieces.} Rd5 {I may never know if he wanted the d-pwan, but I'm sure he's now looking at the a pawn, with a view to a Q-side pawn storm.} 20. c4 Ra5 {He's welcome to try. As far as I'm concerned, it's a once active piece now out on the sidelines. I don't plan on giving the Q-side pawns time to get very far.} 21. c5 {Time my knight woke up. He's off to d6.} Rxa3 22. Nc4 Rc3 23. Nd6 Rxe3 {Rxe3??. I saw e8+ as a threat for the knight, but only a threat as I didn't really expect to be able to play it. I was simply trying to use threats to keep blacks active pieces busy whilst moving mine into better positions.} 24. Ne8+ {But as I was allowed to play it, it would have seemed so wrong not to. (having checked for obvious traps of course, but with a lone rook? No chance! Now I'm starting to smell a win.} Kd8 25. Nxf6 a5 {here come the pawns, releasing the rook too.} 26. d5 {Intending opening the d file.} Ke7 27. d6+ {He's welcome to the knight. It simplifies matters. If ...Kxf6 then d7. Either I queen, or he loses a rook for my knight and pawn, or...} Kxf6 28. d7 Nxd7 29. Rxd7 {... I lose the pawn outright, but how many squares does his king have available?} a4 30. Rfd1 {The end is in sight.} Rxh3 {Mate in 8.} 31. Rd1d6+ {The rook can stay there. It's not in my way on h3!} Kf5 {The rook can stay there. It's not in my way on h3! Mate in 7} 32. Rf7+ Kg4 33. Rxg6+ Kh4 34. g3+ Rxg3+ 35. hxg3+ Kh3 36. Rh7 {And black resigns, due to ...Rh8 being the only defence to Rxh5. }
