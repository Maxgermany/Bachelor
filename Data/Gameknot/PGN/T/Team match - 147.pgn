Nxc4 axb3 {Best Move: a3} 54. axb3 Kf7 {Best Move: Kh7} 55. Ne5+ {It appears to me that White had the advantage for the entire game. A few errors were made on both sides however White's mistakes were insufficient to turn the tide of the game while Black's mistakes just made his position worse. It might have been possible to turn the game around if Black played a few moves differently, especially in the early-mid game. Which was approximately when White had procured a decisive advantage. }
