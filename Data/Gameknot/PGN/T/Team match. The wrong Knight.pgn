1. Nf3 {Chess literature has cases when a player has moved the wrong rook to an open file. cases where players have moved the wrong knight are less common. I invite you to play through this game and stop after White's 17th move and work out which knight you would use to recapture on d5 and why. Then play on and see if you are right!} d5 {1. Nf3 constitutes the Reti opening, named after Richard Reti  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_R%C3%A9ti The Reti usually transposes into a reversed defence to a Queen Pawn opening, for instance, 2. c4 d5 leads to a reversed Benoni which is good for White. A Reversed King's Indian is also quite a common set-up. Probably the best way for Black to equalise is to just copy White's moves.} 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 c6 {c6 is designed to blunt the power of the White bishop on g2.} 4. O-O Bg4 {Played with the idea of perhaps exchanging my White squared bishop and playing e6. The loss of the bishop is compensated by having several pawns on white squares.} 5. b3 Nbd7 6. Bb2 Qc7 7. d3 e5 {White has continued with sensible, if slightly unambitious development. The game has now developed into a sort of Modern defence reversed.} 8. Nbd2 {I should probably have developed by Black squared bishop to d6 to support the e pawn. I was influenced by the fact that this position had arisen 3 times in the Gameknot database. In that, in 2 games Black had played Bd6 and had won one and lost one. Black had won the only game with Be7 (Kunte Abhijit (2479) vs. Zhang Pengxiang (2530)} Be7 9. c4 {but in that game, White didn't play 9 c4, so I had to start thinking for myself!} O-O 10. h3 Bh5 {9.	h3	Bh5 10.	Nh4 had been played instead in that game, so it seemed reasonable to me to not exchange my White squared bishop.} 11. cxd5 cxd5 12. Rc1 Qd6 13. Qc2 Bd8 {Played to prevent the White queen coming in at c7, but can it really be good to break the link between the rooks? Of course, if I had played the bishop to d6 on move 8 this would not have been a problem.} 14. e4 {Now I was a bit afraid that if I played d4 White has knight c4 attacking my queen and attacking e4 for the third time and winning a pawn. Also if d4 the knight can again come in on c4. Although it doesn't win a pawn, it does look like a strong outpost for the knight. I chickened out and exchanged off one of his knights.} Bxf3 15. Nxf3 Re8 {Now, having given up a bishop for knight, I should have closed up the position with d4, either on move 15 or 16.} 16. a3 Nb6 17. exd5 {So this is the critical position. Q takes pawn obviously just loses a pawn to knight takes pawn, but which knight is it best to recapture with?} Nfxd5 {Wrong!! I wanted to keep the other knight at b6 in order to be able to play Rc8 to contest the c file, but it is a mistake!} 18. Nxe5 {Bravo! At first I thought I could win knight and bishop for rook here with Rxe5, 19. Bxe5 Qxe5, but then White has Re1 and if my queen moves there is a nasty rook check on e8, which is either mate or wins my queen. If I had taken back on d5 with the other knight, then the Nf3 would be covering the e8 square!} Rc8 {Well if I can't recapture on e5, I may as well carry on with my original plan!} 19. Qd2 {And now there was a most unusual end to the game. It was a team match, and as I was a pawn up in the other game, and a pawn down in the other game, I offered to have draws in both games, which he accepted! I leave you to decide who had the better of the deal!}
