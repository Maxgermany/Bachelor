1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d5 {This only drops a pawn. 4. Nf6 ... 5. d5 would have been good positional play. 4. exd5 Nb4  5. Nc3, as shown in this game leaves you not only down in development but also down a pawn.} 4. exd5 Nb4 5. Nc3 c6 {He is taking control of the center. d5 is starting to look more and more like a gambit than a pawn drop, if not a very effective one. d5xc6 is practically forced...} 6. dxc6 bxc6 7. Kf1 {The mysterious king move. What was he looking at? What was he trying to achieve? Nobody knows but him.} e4 {Yay! Another pawn drop, an opponent's attacking Knight in great position, and complete loss of the center. It does make for an interesting development game, however.} 8. Nxe4 f5 {See what I mean? Interesting game. 9. d3 fxe4  10. Bg5 Nf6  11. Ne5 exd3  12. Bf7+ Ke7  13. Bxf6+ gxf6  14. Nxc6+  Black doesn't necessarily drop his queen, not even close, but you get how d3 could be a scary positional gambit.} 9. d3 {9. d3 fxe4  10. Bg5 Nf6  11. Ne5 exd3  12. Bf7+ Ke7  13. Bxf6+ gxf6  14. Nxc6+  Black doesn't neccesarily drop his queen, not even close, but you get how d3 could be a scary positional gambit.} fxe4 {as} 10. Bg5 Nf6 11. Ne5 exd3 12. Bf7+ Ke7 13.
