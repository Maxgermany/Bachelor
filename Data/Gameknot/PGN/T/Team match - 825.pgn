1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5 {I can not understand this move. Looks aggressive but there is not enough pieces. I want the classic 3...a6 or 3...Nf6 to open your game. Anyway it´s style´s matter} 4. Nc3 Nf6 {I dont know, but with 4...fxe4 you are in line with your plan} 5. exf5 e4 6. Ng5 d5 7. d3 h6 {Well I think there is no reason to fear. 7...Bxf5 and you have another piece to play} 8. Bxc6+ {Well, he did not see 8.Ne6 at first} bxc6 9. Nh3 {Hey kain-, there is a God for you, obviously with 9.Ne6 he is making a great investment, because he would gave back the gambit and after the attack to your pawn structure it would seems like a greek ruins} Bxf5 {Oh the beatifull of chess, after this bad move (9.Nh3?) you are with a little advantage. He has one bad knight, and you have two bishops in an open game.  At this time its difficult to exploit your pawn´s structure. Anyway he has to play against your pawns and move 10.dxe4} 10. Nf4 Bd6 {kain- you have to accept that 10...exd3 is a better move because you are free of this weakness in e4, what is the head on this structure} 11. O-O O-O 12. g3 Bxf4 {Nooo! Oh my god. That was the bad horse and you are eating bad quality meat. Your better bishop were this one because your other bishop seems like a big pawn containing your pawns, and besides the white bishop is without space and you make it free. I like the more aggressive 12...Bg4} 13. Bxf4 exd3 14. cxd3 Bh3 {I like 14...d4, retaining the d3 pawn and making space for Nd4} 15. Re1 Ng4 16. f3 Nf6 {Sometimes believe in your attack, even better 16...g5 and if 17.Bxc7 Qxc7 18.fxg4 Qb6  19.d4 Qb2 20.Ne2 Bxg4 and you are confortable} 17. Be5 Re8 18. d4 Nh7 {Why not 18...Nd7.  The white bishop seems like a big radar} 19. Kf2 Rf8 {Dont like 19...Rb8 ?} 20. Re3 {20.Re3! I dont know but I think he wants to take the e column with heavy metal} Ng5 21. Qa4 Qd7 22. Bf4 Ne6 23. Ne2 Rf7 24. Rc1 Rb8 25. b3 Rb6 {Better 25...g5 to go against the f column} 26. Qxa7 Nxf4 27. Nxf4 {That was a definitive move because you have a bad bishop, your rooks are not playing in concert and he wants to get the e column} g5 28. Ng6 Qd8 29. Ne5 Rf6 30. g4 h5 31. gxh5 Bc8 32. a4 Ra6 33. Qc5 {Well its not only the e column, but the c one} Bf5 34. Rg1 {And the g column} Kh7 35. Rxg5 Kh6 {You dont forget, you still have a queen, better 35...Qd6} 36. f4 {Better 36.Qc1, and if you play 36...Kg5 37.Nf7  Rf7 38.Re8  and lost the queen}
