1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 Bd6 5. c3 O-O 6. O-O Qe7 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 Bc5 9. b4 Bb6 10. Re1 Re8 11. Bxc6 dxc6 12. h3 c5 13. a3 cxb4 {This is the biggest advantage Black gets in the whole game.} 14. axb4 c5 15. bxc5 Qxc5 16. d4 exd4 17. cxd4 Qc7 18. Bg3 Qd7 19. Be5 Bc7 {Probably not the best. With the unbelievable 19...Rxe5! 20. dxe5 Qxd1 21. Rxd1 Nxe4 22. Ra2 Be6 gives Black the two bishops and good attacking prospects for the exchange.} 20. Bxf6 gxf6 21. Nc3 f5 22. Qd3 fxe4 23. Nxe4 Qf5 {Here Black walks into the losing exchange.  23...Re6 would have been a better alternative.} 24. Nf6+ Qxf6 25. Rxe8+ Kg7 26. Re4 {....but White returns the favor and the exchange. He would have consolidated his advantage with 26. Ne5 Bd6 27. Rc1 b5.} Bf5 27. Rae1 Bxe4 28. Qxe4 Qc6 29. Qg4+ Qg6 30. Qd7 Qd6 31. Re7 Qxd7 32. Rxd7 Rc8 33. d5 b6 {33...Kf6 was better, to get the king into the game.} 34. d6 {34. Nd4 gives White better prospects. } Bb8 35. Ne5 Rf8 36. Nc6 Kf6 {Black should have made the most of his passed pawns. 36...a5 37. Nd4 Rc8 38. g3 Kf6 keeps White's advantage to a minimum, but the text-move does not cause any major damage.} 37. Nxb8 Rxb8 38. Rxa7 Rd8 {yet again, 38....b5 is better, but the text-move does not spoil Black's chances that much, but Black must play with more care.} 39. d7 Ke7 40. Rb7 Rxd7 41. Rxb6 f6 42. g4 Kf7 43. Kg2 Kg6 44. Re6 Rf7 45. Kg3 Rd7 46. h4 Rd3+ 47. Re3 Rd5 48. Re4 f5 {48...Rd6 is better, as it gives support from the back. Now things get tougher for Black.} 49. Re6+ Kg7 50. gxf5 {50. g5 hxg5 51. hxg5 Rd4 52. f3 is better. The text-move gives Black more control and gives Black better drawing chances.} Rxf5 51. f4 h5 {....and here is one of three mistakes that should have cost Black the game. Here 51...Rd5 halts White's attack enough so that Black can organise himself to get better chances.} 52. Kf3 {52. Re5 was a better alternative. } Kf7 {52...Rc5 was better here.} 53. Re5 Kf6 {This is the main blunder. White is able to infiltrate Black successfully. Here 53...Kg6 supports both pieces and gives Black more chances. Black may have lost his last chance, however......} 54. Rxf5+ Kxf5 55. Ke3 Kg4 56. Ke4 Kxh4 57. Ke5 {White throws away a golden oppourtunity: He wins with 57. Kf3!! where via computer analysis, Black cannot avoid mate in twelve moves. The text-move gives Black a draw, as both sides queen on the same move.} Kg4 {57....Kg5 does not work, as we shall soon see.} 58. f5 h4 59. f6 h3 60. f7 h2 61. f8=Q h1=Q 62. Qg8+ {....now we see why 57...Kg5 would have been a blunder. Black would have been forced to play Kg6, 5 or 4 and then Qh8 or h7+ wins the queen.} Kf3 {?? - Biggest blunder of the game, this walks into Mate in eight! Who did not see the skewer at this point? 62...Kh3 is the only move, and gives a draw. } 63. Qb3+ {?? - however, White for the second time, throws away his winning chance. He wins via the skewer: 63. Qa8+ Ke3 64. Qxh1 Kd3 65. Qc6 Ke2 66. Qe4+ Kd1 67. Qg2 Kc1 68. Kd4 Kd1 69. Kd3 Kc1 70. Qc2# } Kf2 64. Qb6+ Kg2 65. Qg6+ Kf2 {Draw Agreed. A highly entertaining game that had its highs and lows.}
