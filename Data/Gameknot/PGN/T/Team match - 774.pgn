[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {An elegant mate} Nf6 {an unconventional opening from my point of view...} 2. e3 d5 3. Nc3 {The first battle is for the control of the center. } Ng4 {The attack on e3 is expected} 4. Nh3 {and parried} e5 {so now the decision...for the center of the board...} 5. e4 {who has the upper hand? } dxe4 {it looks to be black..} 6. dxe5 {still black, although white is more developed...} Bb4 {but not for long!} 7. a3 {back I say, back...} Bc5 {so now the key decision...queens?} 8. Qxd8+ {Yep...I think that the game is more interesting without queens on occasion..} Kxd8 {and his king is castle proof...} 9. Bg5+ {so get the major pieces out and about} f6 10. exf6 {this is a fun aspect of the pawn game..pushing pawns to the end...} Re8 {I think that this might have been the turning point in the game...} 11. f7+ {Presently I am one point up...} Be7 12. Bxe7+ {So my hope here is that the Castle captures the Bishop} Rxe7 {which he does} 13. g3 {But I failed to do the next thing..QUEEN...what was I thinking?} Rxf7 {not thinking...} 14. Nxe4 {so I have given him a way out and now I have to dig deep...} b6 {sothe game continues} 15. Bg2 {and continues} Bb7 16. Rd1+ {so I have to get serious here....} Nd7 17. O-O {Castling is key in this situation...} c5 18. Nd6 {So I have to mobilize to corner his king and mate him now that I have given him an out} Bxg2 {WHAT - I am really not paying attention at all...} 19. Kxg2 {OK, still one point up ...still hope..} Re7 {The board is not organized...I need to get both castles and both knights going...} 20. Rfe1 {his castle is a problem for me though} Rxe1 {OK an exchange} 21. Rxe1 {thus...still one point up} Kc7 {I think there is a way} 22. Ne8+ {perhaps a point exchange?} Kb7 {nope..} 23. Re7 {pin the Knight  } Kc8 {danger brews...} 24. Nf4 {get the knight involved} Kd8 {OK...almost locked in...} 25. Nd5 {depending on what he does next..its game over...} Nge5 {hhhmm ...what to do?} 26. Nec7 {good plan!...so if he moves his Castle over...} Rc8 {like that...then I do....} 27. Re8# {this!}
