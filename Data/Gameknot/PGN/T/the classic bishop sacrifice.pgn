1. e4 e5 2. f4 Bc5 {the king's gambit declined. i personally think this is the best response to the king's gambit because it turns the tables on white because white now has a very annoying dark square bishop which he has to deal with before he can launch his attack on the weak f7 pawn!!} 3. Nf3 d6 4. d4 {i have to stay in attack mode, so I sacrifice a pawn because this bishop is simply too strong right now i don't mind giving up a pawn to neatralise it!! anywhere this is quick and effective and allows me to castle  } exd4 5. Bd3 {this is exactly what i wanted from the sacrifice!! now his bishop is useless!! for now anywheres!} Nf6 6. O-O O-O 7. e5 {i launch my attach just at the right time not too early or too late!!} dxe5 8. fxe5 Nd5 {at this point in the game a flash of genius entered my mind!! the move i made i have seen the computer or masters make it against me from the day i started playing chess until now so when i made it i suddenly realized this was the first time I wasn't and the receiving end and it felt good!!} 9. Bxh7+ {BOOM!! yes looks flashy and all, but pretty harmless!! all black has to do is move the king and the game goes on!!} Kxh7 {but black doesn't  know better and thus i shall teach him a  lesson!!} 10. Ng5+ {black has three choices resign or exchange his queen for a knight, bishop and a weak king or get checkmated!!} Kg6 {my opponent wishes to get checkmated!! so i will gladly grant his wish!!} 11. Qd3+ {can't play f5 because i will enpassant the pawn!!} Kh5 12. Qh7+ Kg4 13. Qh3# {a pretty harmless move leads to checkmate four moves later!! yes chess can be really cruel sometimes!!}
