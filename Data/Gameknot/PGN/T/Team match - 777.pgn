[Opening "Budapest (A52), Adler variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 {This move initiates the Budapest Gambit. Even in lines where White holds on to the pawn, his pawn structure is usually so fractured that Black need not fear an endgame.} 3. dxe5 {For some reason, many of my opponents decline the gambit with moves such as 3.d5 but there is no reason to do so.} Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5 {Move order is crucial in gambit openings. At the 2007 Kansas Open, I got my move order mixed up, played 4...Bb4 , and was dissatisfied with my position, although I got a draw.} 5. e3 Nc6 6. Be2 Ngxe5 7. O-O d6 8. Nd4 Bd7 {Black does not want to initiate any trades on d4, because that would give White an imposing center. The pawn on c4 is not especially strong, and in some lines, Black may aim to put strong pressure on it.} 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Nd5 Bxd4 {Reluctantly agreeing to the trade, although in retrospect, I wasn't particularly forced to. I didn't want to encourage a queenside pawn storm with b4, although this plan is still possible for WHite.} 11. exd4 Ng6 12. Nf4 {The knight on d5 is very strong, certainly stronger than Black's knight on g6. I see no reason for White to initiate this trade.} Qf6 {Choosing to keep Black's pawn structure intact, anticipating an endgame.} 13. Nxg6 {I considered taking with the h-pawn, as the queen pressures the d-pawn from f6, but the pawn is easily enough defended, plus, the pressure down the g-file is somewhat uncomfortable for Black.} Qxg6 14. Bf3 {Strongly pressuring Black's queenside.} Rfe8 15. Be3 a6 {Black wants to play Rb8 to better defend the b-pawn, but this would leave the pawn on a7 vulnerable after d5.} 16. Qb3 b6 17. Rac1 Rab8 18. Qa3 a5 {Black is giving White tempi to set up a good defensive structure on the queenside.} 19. c5 {This allows the knight to jump into e5, where it is very effective and sets up some strong threats.} dxc5 20. dxc5 Ne5 21. Bd5 {21.Bf4 seems much better, preparing to capture the strong knight while defending the bishop on f3 with the queen.} c6 {All Black needs is to remove this bishop from the long diagonal...} 22. Bb3 Bh3 23. g3 Nf3+ {Pinning the king down on h1, and adding it to the endangered species list.} 24. Kh1 Qh5 {There is no need to start grabbing material when Black can play for mate.} 25. Rfd1 Bg4 26. h4 {White's only way to stop } Nxh4 27. Kg1 {27.gxh4 Qxh4  28.Kg1 Bf3 transposes to the game.} Bf3 28. Rd7 Ng6 {It wasn't too late for Black to go wrong: 28...Nf5?? 29.Bxf7 } 29. Bxf7+ Kh8 {White has no way of avoiding being mated next move.} 30. Bxg6 Qh1# {}
