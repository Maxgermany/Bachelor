[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {I had a trio of games with this opponent. The first one I made a physical error around the 15th move and moved the wrong pawn (i seem to come up with a lot of different ways to lose a chess game.) The second game I won but only because he hung his bishop. I think it bothered him as near the end of that game he challenged me to a third game which is the one I'm annotating here. It was my best game of the three. I'm currently learning some new openings. The English Defense and her cousin the Nimzo-Larsen Attack. This is an English defense...Please forgive my annotations. I am a very self-absorbed person and focus on the things that are going on in my own head during a game. I'm sure my opponents would have their own slant on things. A chess game is a fight, a war and a drama that unfolds on a 64 square field where we are the kings and the masters of our own fate.} e6 {When my opponent opens with d5, I usually respond with e6 when playing the English Defense as per Daniel King in his book on the English defense. He is up on these things much more than I...that's a good book by the way.} 2. Bf4 {7beaufeet7, my opponent likes the London System of developing his pieces. I'm also learning that system as well so I'm familiar with what he is trying to do here.} b6 {The English Defense like the Nimzo-Larsen involves fianchettoing the queen bishop.} 3. Nf3 Bb7 {Welcome to the English Defense.} 4. e3 {7beaufeet7 continues with his London style development which usually entails developing his pieces within a solid pawn structure. This tells me that he is more of a counter attacker like myself but in this game I become uncharacteristically aggressive. } f5 {I strike out at the center. I'm trying to take control of the E4 square.} 5. Be2 Nf6 {We continue to develop our pieces.} 6. h3 Na6 {I never liked that move h3 but I see it all the time. I play my queen's knight to a6 not wanting to block my bishop. This move looks awkward but in replaying several master games of this defense I came upon this move being made again and again. I think it is just within the nature of this opening.} 7. O-O Bd6 {He castles and I do something I did in our first game, I challenge his dark squared bishop with my own. As I said earlier,  I'm familiar with the London System and I'm not going to let him have that diagonal.} 8. Bxd6 cxd6 {We exchange bishops and the pawns on my d file are doubled just as they were in our first game. } 9. Ng5 O-O {I castle to fend off his knight escapades. It was time to castle anyway.} 10. Nf3 {He retreats losing time. Can I take advantage of that?} Rc8 {I grab the half open file with my rook which is also nicely protected by my bishop.} 11. c3 {He shuts down the file while strengthening his pawn structure. That is the classic London System pawn configuration. A very solid pawn skeleton. But I have ideas on how to crack it.} Nc7 12. Nbd2 {We both maneuver with our knights to get them in play.} Ne4 {As I said I was aggressive in this game and decided to occupy the e4 square.} 13. Nxe4 fxe4 {I saw this exchange coming, now my e4 pawn drives his knight back into his own camp.} 14. Nd2 d5 {Just like our first game I push my pawn to d5 giving myself 2 sets of doubled pawns. My pawn structure in the center reminds me of a piece of DNA, I liken it to a corkscrew. I'm going to attack White's pawn structure in waves of pawn advances. Notice both my rooks are on the half opened files vacated by my pawns.} 15. c4 {He plays c4 attacking my d5 pawn but also weakening his London style pawn structure.} Qf6 {I get my queen involved in things on the king side. I'm going to play her in behind my advancing pawns and try to push White back and take over more territory in the center.} 16. Rc1 e5 {White develops his rook and I again attack his pawn center with e5.} 17. dxe5 Qxe5 {I think I'm looking better here. I'm now threatening his b2 pawn. There's not much left of his center pawn structure now. I have a lot of space on the king side. My bishop is blocked but is also providing needed support for my d5 pawn.} 18. Rc2 d4 {He protects his pawn and I in turn push my pawn to d4. My advancing pawns are supported by my queen and my English bishop. Pretty aggressive for me. It's nice to see my strategy be realized during the game. The English defense and the Nimzo-Larsen can give you nice pawn structures in the middle game and make for creative original play...........by the way despite what I am thinking, Fritz 8, my trusty Dr Watson rates things about even here.} 19. exd4 Qxd4 {Another exchange. Look at the pawn structure now. I still have two center pawns (one in the center and the other ready to be advanced from d7). His position looks confined, like three people in a single bed.)  I just have to follow through but ah that's another story.......Frtiz 8 still thinks it about even.} 20. Nb3 {White attacks my queen. Can't say I blame him.} Qxd1 {I take his queen.} 21. Rxd1 {His rook scoops my queen. Now where are we at?} Nd5 {I play my knight up. Things are getting tactical now, if he takes my knight, my rook will take his own rook.} 22. Rcc1 {He backs up his rook. He has done a lot of backing up in this game. I was really focused in this one and wanted to beat this guy. I was feeling confident and aggressive.} Nf4 {Another tactical shot, if his rook takes my pawn on d7, my knight will fork his king and rook while capturing his bishop. I know these are simple maneuvers but I'm more of a positional player and when I can use a tactical device I like to mention it.} 23. Bf1 {He has to back up again. I feel like I'm literally pushing him off the board. It feels good. It feels empowering. Perhaps this partly explains the attraction of chess. To have a strategy, map it out and execute it and to see it play out before your eyes..............all the while fritz has us about even.} d5 {I push my pawn up challenging him to take it.} 24. cxd5 {He does take it and now we have reached the moment in the game where I for some reason and I can't really explain why, throw everything away that I have worked so hard for. It wasn't a complicated position. I moved fast without thinking and played this...} Nxd5 {I should have taken the pawn with my bishop, my English bishop yet. Chess seems to bring out my flaws. A certain impulsive like impatience. A frustration emerges which in the chess world must be punished. } 25. Bc4 {His bishop pins my knight...Desolation...after being in charge the whole game things have turned on a dime and now White is in the driver seat.} Rfd8 {Can't remember what I was thinking other than I was still in a state of shock and anger with myself. A chess game can take on a life of it's own and monopolize your mind.......interestingly enough Fritz indicates that this is the move that buried me, so in my dismay in playing the wrong move a few moves earlier, I have now made things much worse, sometimes it's better to logoff and re-compose yourself after you go wrong in a game.....a chess lesson for me...once again...} 26. Bxd5+ {My king under attack, where have all the good times gone.} Bxd5 {I take his bishop but I'm going to lose on the ensuing exchange.} 27. Rxc8 Rxc8 {An exchange of rooks.} 28. Rxd5 {And now White's rook cuts down my bishop and it's my english bishop besides. A symbolic defeat on top of everything else. } Rc2 {I know I'm done but I try to make some noise on the seventh rank.} 29. Rd2 Rxd2 30. Nxd2 Kf7 {An exchange of rooks, as the pieces leave the board, my missing bishop is looming larger all the time.} 31. Nxe4 {his knight gobbles up what remained of my center pawns.} h5 {At this point I could have resigned but I played on awhile.} 32. h4 g6 33. f3 {Like Chinese water torture.} Ke6 34. g4 {My king must be thinking, 'how the hell did this happen?'} Ke5 {He lashes out at  white's knight but it is all in vain.} 35. Nf2 Kf4 {and now into the fire.} 36. Kg2 hxg4 {i'm bluffing more than playing now.} 37. fxg4 g5 {I guess I deserve this. Another chess lesson...The only victory in chess is total victory...} 38. h5 Ke5 39. Kf3 Kf6 40. Ke4 {I resign...What an ignoble ending. And so ends my trio of games with one...7beaufeet7...Someday we will meet again. Him and the other hundreds of guys who have bested me over the chess board...But it's not really him I have to master. I see in my opponents my dark half, my weakness...all the defects in  myself that lie festering underneath the surface. When ever I play a game of chess i see them all on the other side of the board. My challenge is to conquer myself and my own demons. In both the games I have annotated I made very poor moves after I lost my composure. For me more than anything else chess remains as much a psychological war as anything else...................   postscript..............upon reflection and with the passage of time i see now that i never had the clear advantage i thought i had during the game which raises an interesting point...a common error in chess thought is to become so fixated on a move or variation that it produces an inhibiting effect on all other thoughts, a chess game will never stop speaking to you and can take on a life of it's own with it's accompanying variations....the well is very deep and the roads not taken will be many...........say you know Frasier Crane could have written this.}
