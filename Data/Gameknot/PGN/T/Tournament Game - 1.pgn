1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. Nc3 Na6 {The first departure from symmetry. Perhaps not the best move.} 4. d3 {Solidly guarding the KP.} b6 {Preparing the fianchetto.} 5. Nh3 {Both players flank Knights in a Hypermodern style.} Bb7 6. O-O {Completing the K-side development.} h6 {I suppose this is meant to impede the development of White's QB, but it seems a wasted move.} 7. Kh1 Nb4 8. f4 f6 {This move usually spells trouble for Black. You'd think by now players would know to avoid it.} 9. fxe5 fxe5 10. Qh5+ {Mate to follow.} Ke7 {10...P-N3 is no better} 11. Qxe5# {Well done.}
