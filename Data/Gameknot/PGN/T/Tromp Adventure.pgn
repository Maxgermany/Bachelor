1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 Ne4 3. Bf4 {trompowsky } c5 4. f3 Nf6 5. d5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Qd2 O-O {this allows white to exchange dark bishops, and leaves black king a little exposed} 9. Bh6 Nbd7 10. a4 {i played this as i expected black to attempt to get play on the queenside} Ne5 11. Bxg7 Kxg7 12. f4 {pushing knight back and creating a center} Ned7 13. Nh3 {I was thinking about putting knight on f2 to support a g4 advance, but this may be over aggressive as castling queenside looks a bit dubious as I have played a4 and weakened queenside} b6 {Black is cramped and is finding it hard to find squares for his pieces} 14. Be2 Bb7 15. Ng5 {this looks like wasting moves with whiteknight, I was hoping that I would provoke h6 but I think now black should have played a6 followed by b5 this would generate active play } Rc8 16. O-O {wondering could black have played c4 now, but pawn on c4 may have need more support, maybe by Ba6 .. looks messy but black needs something active as quickly as possible. The only other option I could see was e6 which would normally free the black position, but the white knight on g5 is accidentally stopping this } h6 17. Nf3 Ne8 {I am not sure what blacks plan was here. I think c4 needed to be played. This also frees c5 for the black knight} 18. Bc4 {This stops c4 push for a while and the traffic jam continues for black} Nc7 {Possibly preparing e6 or a6,b5} 19. e5 {White needed to act whilst blacks pieces are passively placed} dxe5 20. fxe5 Re8 21. Rae1 Nf8 22. h3 Na6 {This is a mistake} 23. Bb5 Nd7 24. e6 fxe6 25. dxe6 Nf6 {I thought black had escaped the attack, my thoughts of capturing the rook with my bishop which i had intended is no longer available as my queen is unprotected. However after a while I saw my next move} 26. Qe2 Bxf3 27. Rxf3 Qd4+ 28. Rf2 Nc7 29. Bxe8 Ncxe8 30. Rd1 Qb4 31. Rd7 {This is an interesting position. It seems that Black can not play NXR as PXN creates a fork on 2 pieces.} Rc7 32. Rxf6 {Black Resigns}
