1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 e6 4. Bxc4 Bb4+ 5. Nc3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. O-O Nbc6 9. Ba3 {A quiet, positional opening, befitting the double QP opening moves.} Na5 10. Bb3 Nxb3 11. axb3 {After a small skirmish, opposite-colored Bishops are left. Already, the sense that a draw could ensue is foreboding. OCB's often do lead to drawish end-game positions.} b6 12. c4 Ba6 13. Rc1 Ng6 14. e5 Re8 15. Re1 b5 16. Bc5 bxc4 17. bxc4 {Black has gained the advantage of a passed QRP.} Bb7 18. h3 Nh4 19. Nxh4 Qxh4 {The OCB's are now locked firmly into place as the final minor pieces on the board.} 20. Qd3 Qg5 21. f3 a5 22. Rcb1 Ba6 23. Re4 h5 24. Kh2 {I tuck my King away, as I have hopes of an attack.} Rab8 25. Ree1 Rxb1 26. Rxb1 {So much for that idea. Now a long, tense end-game follows.} h4 27. Qc2 Qg3+ 28. Kh1 Ra8 29. Kg1 g6 30. Rc1 {More slow maneuvering. Neither side has accomplished much.} Bb7 31. Qf2 Qf4 32. Qe1 Qg5 33. Rb1 {An oversight, which Black exploits.} Bxf3 34. Qf2 Be4 35. Rb3 a4 36. Re3 Bc6 37. g4 hxg3 e.p. 38. Rxg3 {To activate the Rook.} Qc1+ 39. Qf1 Qc2 40. Qd3 Qxd3 41. Rxd3 {Reducing the chances of a tactical surprise, and playing for the OCB ending.} Rb8 42. Kh2 Rb3 43. Rxb3 axb3 44. Ba3 {If I don't play this move at once, the Pawn will queen.} Kg7 45. Kg3 f6 46. exf6+ {I intend to swap off ans many Pawns as possible.} Kxf6 47. Kg4 Be4 48. Bb2 Bf5+ 49. Kg3 {I intend to blockade the black squares.} Kg5 50. h4+ Kh5 51. c5 {This renders the Black Bishop essentially useless.} c6 52. Bc3 g5 53. hxg5 Kxg5 54. Kf3 {With the K-side resolved, I can slide over to the new theatre of action.} Bc2 55. Bb2 Kf5 56. Ke3 {As long as I can keep the Black King away from my B, the game will be drawn.} Bd1 57. Kd3 {"Drawing" the game to a close.} Bc2+ 58. Ke3 {Steady as she goes.} Be4 59. Bc3 {Locking things down tight.} Bd5 60. Bb2 {Draw agreed, as despite his material advantage Black has no way to make progress.}
