1. c4 {Unlike that game this one is much less one sided, I allow black to easily equalise in the opening and after that the computer, for a while, even prefers blacks position slightly. However I had to tap into all my resources but eventually I managed to grind out an edge which eventually turned decisive} Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. d4 b6 4. Nf3 Bb7 5. g3 {This is still book however I'm not certain that the fianchetto is the best way to develop here, it just doesnt seem necessary, instead a3 to prevent Bb5 is played most often followed by the also logical Bg5} c5 {?! This is the first real suspect move, white can now play 6.d5 and an opening advantage will have been gained. Basically this allows white to enter into a favourable bennoni type structure} 6. e3 {?! however I fail to do so, to be honest I cant explain why I wouldnt play the very natural 6.d5 since it seems so obvious, I suspect I didnt look at the position properly just giving it a passing glance} d5 {Now black has achieved equality} 7. Bg2 Nbd7 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. O-O Be7 10. Re1 {I have a pawn majority in the center so I decided that I would try to make a plan based around that, this prepares to advance in the center} O-O 11. e4 Nxc3 12. bxc3 {I was happy enough to have the extra support of my pawn center, once I achieve a solid center I'll have better chances of conducting a successful attack on the wings} Nf6 13. Qd3 {This supports e4 but by repositioning to the b1-h7 diagonal there are now potential tactics that black should at least keep in mind. A sample line is 13...Rc8 14.Ng5!? threatning e5 winning material 14...h6?? 15.e5! hxg5 (or 15...Bxg2 16.exf6 hxg5 17.fxe7 Qxe7 18.Kxg2) 16.exf6 Bxf6 17.Bxb7} h6 {Keeping solid and avoiding any Ng5 possibilities} 14. a4 {This sl9ightly restrains blacks majority and one day I'll maybe carry on to a5 in the attempt to create a pawn weakness} Rc8 15. Bd2 c4 {?! until this point I felt the position was basically equal but now that black has relieved pressure against the center white can start thinking about preparing to attack on the wings, probably the kingside is the most likely candidate. But don't get me wrong, the position isn't anymore than marginally more comfortable for white, realizing an advantage is still a long way off, the position is that after this its white who now gets to probe for an edge well black will have to react} 16. Qc2 Re8 17. Ne5 {It isn't so easy to come up with an active plan, however I decided that playing f4 with a space advantage would be useful, plus a knight on e5 can be a useful piece} Nd7 {Black has less space and since he is defending it makes alot of sense that exchanges will be in blacks favor, besides, he needs to challenge my knight now before I can play f4 and drop back.} 18. f4 {I figure if black exchanges, my double pawns will have opened up the f file for me and also give me extra space in the centre, plus having yet another center pawn will mean I can look to get in d5 at an opportune moment. Since I have an advantage in space and I'm the one attacking it may have been worth considering holding onto the knight by playing to g4 as well} Nxe5 19. fxe5 {white has the edge here but it is still going to be difficult to win against best play by black} Bg5 {seeking more exchanges} 20. Ref1 Bxd2 21. Qxd2 Qg5 22. Qf2 {I definatly dont wont to exchange queens. White has good chances to probe black since I can mix ideas of applying pressure down the f file and at the same time keeping black thinking about the possible d5 break, plus in some cases I can also play for pressure on the queenside } Qg6 23. a5 Re7 {? I think this is the point at which whites game gains real winning chances, the best defense was to play 23...b5} 24. axb6 axb6 {Now I have a real target to attack and because of my 'doubled pawns' in the center white will entually be able to force the win of material. With blacks queen on the now unimportant king side white is going to switch to the queenside and centre } 25. Qf4 {But first I take a moment to protect e4 and e5} Qg5 {Now that Iv'e created a weakness I'm perfectly alright with allowing an exchange of queens } 26. Rfb1 Qxf4 27. gxf4 {Notice again how the 'double' pawns turn out to be useful, this now gives me an additional break to consider and it also protects e5 for when I do eventually get in d5} Rc6 28. Kf2 {Of course immediatly playing 28.d5 suggests itself, however there is no way for black to hold onto b6 so I take a moment to improve the position of my king. It also puts black in something of a mini zuzwang } Bc8 {I wont comment on the rest of the game since it just shows white complete the breakthrough} 29. d5 exd5 30. exd5 Rg6 31. Ra8 Re8 32.
