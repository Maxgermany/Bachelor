1. d4 {My second game with vilden. after the blunder with black i wanted to win this one. however i got myself under pressure once again:). The theme of this game is the isolated passed c-pawn. lets take a look.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3 d5 5. e3 O-O 6. Qc2 {one of my favorite moves:)} b6 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bd3 Ba6 9. O-O {white could have taken on a6 but why bring another black piece into the game?} Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Re8 11. a3 {challenging the black squared bishop. will he take or move?} Bxc3 12. bxc3 {12Qxc3 doesn't ruin the pawn structure but 12...Ne4 comes with tempo.} Nc6 {developing a piece and aiming for Na5 later. 12...Ne4 was also playable here.} 13. c4 Na5 14. cxd5 Qxd5 {14...Nxd5 allows 15 e4 and if 15...Nf6 16 e5 and the central pawns start marching. also here black controls c4.} 15. Bd2 {threatening to take on a5 and developing} Nb3 {here i was expecting Nc4 and after 16Rfc1 16...b5 and black has a fix on the c4 square.its not bad though.} 16. Rab1 Nxd2 17. Qxd2 {Nxd2 was an option but i wanted a better control of d4 in the event of c5.} Ne4 {natural move centralising the knight} 18. Qc2 c5 {the anticipated pawn move.} 19. Rbc1 {more of a waiting move on my part. i wanted to see what black will do here. there were other options like dxc5 or even Rfd1.} Rac8 20. Qa4 Qb7 21. dxc5 bxc5 {the key moment. white had to play dxc5 because black was threatening b5 and c4 and the pawns on the queen side are rolling. But now he has to deal with the c-pawn. } 22. Rcb1 Qe7 23. Rfc1 {whites task is to hold that pawn from reaching the first rank. exchanging pieces along the way is acceptable since passed isolated pawns are weaker in the endings.} Red8 24. Qc4 Rd6 {i dont really understand these couple of moves from here on. Nd6 seems better.} 25. Rcd1 h6 26. Rxd6 Nxd6 {white has exchanged one rook which was a part of his plan. im not sure black should have allowed that. Nd6 controls c4 now. However white has some dynamic responses. } 27. Qa6 Qc7 28. Rd1 {harassing the knight. c4 was playable earlier instead of Qc7.} Rb8 {an indirect defence of the knight. back rank mate awaits white if he tries taking it. for example 29 Rxd6 Qxd6 30 Qxd6 Rb1+ 31 Ne1 Rxe1 checkmate.} 29. h3 {now the threat is renewed } Nb5 30. Qa4 {avoiding Rb6. Nc3 isnt a problem since white can play Qd7} c4 31. Rb1 Nd6 {31...c3 probably better. the knight cant be taken. for example 32Rxb5 Rxb5 33Qxb5 c2 and theres no stopping the pawn.} 32. Rxb8+ Qxb8 33. Qc6 {exchanging the second rook and stopping the advance for now. 33 Qc2 with the same idea fails to Qb3. } Qb1+ 34. Kh2 Qb6 {exchanging the queens here is good for black. the b and c pawns are going to be connected and the black knight will help the promotion. for example 25.Qxb6 axb6 36. Ne1 b5 37. Kg1 c3 38. Kf1 Nc4} 35. Qa8+ {avoiding the exchange and pushing the king away from the center.} Kh7 36. Qd5 Qc7 37. Kg1 {avoiding Nb5+ picking the a3 pawn.} c3 38. Ne1 {it seems that black has made some progress in the advance of the pawn. However white has his defencing resources. If 38...c2 39 Qd3+ picks up the pawn.} Kh8 39. Nc2 {blocks the advance since Qd3+ is not an option now.} Qb6 {threatening not only to take the knight with check but also to be right next to the passing pawn helping it advance.} 40. Kh2 Qb2 41. Qxd6 {In my opinion the most important decision in the game for white. At first glance it seems a bit terrifying letting the queen take on c2 since its only two steps away from promoting his pawn. However white bets on harassing the black king with checks that he cannot avoid. Another option was Nb4. For example 41.Nb4 Qd2 42. Nd3 Ne8 but this seemed to me to complicate things more for white. This was a delicate situation and the simpler things were the better for me.} Qxc2 42. Qf8+ Kh7 43. Qxf7 Qd3 {Holding the checking squares and trying to push the pawn. White is a pawn up but that is meaningless here. First priority is to stop that pawn! } 44. Qb3 Qd6+ 45. Kg1 Qd2 46. Qb4 {still preventing the advance} Qd3 47. Qb3 h5 48. Kh2 Qd6+ 49. g3 Qc5 50. Qc2+ g6 51. a4 Qb4 {threatening Qb3.} 52. Qa2 Qf8 {avoiding the checks.} 53. Kg2 Qc8 {Here the draw was agreed. Qa8+ doesnt change anything and black cant stop the checks and advance the pawn at the same time. If for examples tries to move the king instead for example 53...Kg7 then 54.Qc4 threatening the pawn again and blacks play becomes passive. So here black had the advantage with the passed c-pawn but somehow white found all the resources to stop it and take the draw. Perhaps trading the first rook was a bit of an inaccuracy but im not really sure. Maybe black should hold off the exchanges and try for a more dynamic middle game where he could create weaknesses as i was trying to defend the pawn from advancing!}
