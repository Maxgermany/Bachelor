1. f4 {Hi everyone!  I thought I would put this game in with the Knights Coaching Project which is very similar to the opening you Knights Guys are studying at the moment.  Now, hands up how many of you feel nice and secure after giving a check?  Do I have a large show of hands here?  I think so!  Well, mostly some checks are OK but there are others that can and will lead to your detriment.  Amatzia Avni in his book Danger in Chess which I recommend you study gives some examples of bad checks, one of these is a strong player giving a check that results in him resigning on the grounds of unavoidable mate just one move down the line!  In this case Bob giving check did not result in him Copping Old Matey (getting checkmated) but choosing to resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  It was so sad for Bob because up till that check he was winning the game hands down.  This game starts with 1. f4 called The Bird's Opening named after a GM with the surname Bird. This move controls the squares e5 and g5.  It also allows white to play Nf3 without worrying about shutting in the f2 pawn.  Also, if the knight on f3 gets pinned by an enemy bishop then the WQ (in my case Glenda) can move without worrying about my castled position being busted because the knight is also defended by a rook.} d5 {1. ..... d5 - the usual reply preventing/holding back e4.} 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 {3. ..... dxe4 - this move leads to an interesting gambit.} 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 {5. Bc4 - development and hitting at the f7 square preventing a fork.  Black counters with the move Bg4 - Glenda is under fire.  Firstly I now swipe off the f7 pawn with check.} Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ {7. Qxg4+ - here is the interesting point - Glenda does herself in for two pieces in order to rustle up an attack.} Nxg4 8. Be6+ {8. Be6+ - fork on BK on d7 and black knight on g4.} Kc6 {8. ..... Kc6 - the BK is dragged out into the open, but just how dangerous is it really?} 9. Bxg4 Bg7 {9. ...... Bg7 - a strong developing move to try and inhibit my development.} 10. Ne6 {10. Ne6 - an attempt to fence black's pieces in.} Qg8 11. d4 {11. d4 - a bid for freedom.  It opens up a diagonal for Fou Lenoir for starters.} exd3 e.p. 12. cxd3 {12. cxd3 - pawn trade - this doesn't help because my d3 pawn becomes isolated.  Isolanis can become fairly easy targets, with me having just two pieces against the Evil Witch I need this like a bad cold!} Na6 13. a3 {13. a3 - to prevent Nb4 threatening a nasty fork on c2.  I must soon be thinking about tucking Henry up on the kingside.} Nc5 14. Nxc5 Kxc5 {14. ....... Kxc5 - knight trade.} 15. Be3+ {15. Be3+ - developing with a tempo, in this instance this check is good because my opponent has no destructive blockers here.  My plan is to clear the decks - jospeak for clearing the back rank giving me options as to where to put King Henry.} Kd6 16. d4 {16. d4 - first I must screen out Bob's dsb on g7 as Fou Lenoir is no longer protecting the pawn on b2.} Qc4 {16. ...... Qc4 - sssss, here comes the Wicked Witch of the West, now how can I eject her?} 17. Nc3 {17. Nc3 - firstly I continue with my plan to clear the decks.} Qd3 18. Bf2 a6 19. Rb1 {19. Rb1 - defending the vulnerable b2 pawn.} Rhf8 20. Be2 {20. Be2 - begone you Evil Besom!  The Witch flies off to f5.} Qf5 21. O-O {21. 0-0 - at last!  Bob responds with c6 - I expect you wonder - why did Bob not take the f4 pawn?  Well, it is poisonous because if Qxf4?? then the Witch will be pinned to her other half right on the h2-b8 diagonal by Fou Lenoir.  Yup, watch those pins!  It will save you or net you big rating points!} c6 22. Rfd1 {22. Rfd1 - thought it would be a good idea to place a rook on the same file as the enemy king.  All sorts of discovery tactics can abound from this set up.} Kc7 23. Rbc1 Rad8 24. Kh1 {24. Kh1 - it is extremely difficult to formulate a plan here, I end up playing waiting moves which is fatal when down by 3 material points.} Kb8 25. g3 c5 {25. ...... c5 - this move brings about a plethora of exchanges.} 26. dxc5 Rxd1+ 27. Bxd1 {27. Bxd1 - if Rxd1 then Qc2.} Bxc3 28. bxc3 {28. bxc3 - the gap has closed down to two material points but look at the shattered queenside pawns!} Rd8 29. Bd4 {29. Bd4 - Fou Lenoir unites two of these pawns but I fear it will not wash in the long run.} Qd3 30. Bg4 {30. Bg4 - trying to keep my pieces active.} Qe4+ 31. Kg1 h5 32. Rd1 {32. Rd1 - a tactical try that nearly backfires on me.  As soon as I hit the submit button I saw that Rxd4 would be curtains as I would lose Fou Leblanc.  It would then be rook against the witch.  Hmm, maybe I will try and test Bob's endgame skills in that field before waving the white flag.} Rf8 {32. ..... Rf8 - temporary reprieve though this does put pressure on f4.} 33. Bh3 Qe2 34. Rb1 {34. Rb1 - I have the germ of an idea but it will leave the back row vulnerable to the Witch.  Fou Leblanc must protect Henry as best he can while my rook and Fou Lenoir try and attack the BK.} Qe4 35. Rb6 Qe1+ 36. Bf1 {36. Bf1 - walking into a pin but cannot be helped.} g5 37. c6 {37. c6 - If fxg5?? then I will instantly cop Old Matey - do you, the Inquest Jury see how?  In the meanwhile I take advantage of the pin on the b7 pawn to trade off one of my isolanis, in this case the c6 pawn.  This will leave Bob with just one pawn on the queenside, though this pawn could prove decisive to me further on in the endgame.} Kc7 38. cxb7 gxf4 39. b8=Q+ {39. b8/Q - Glenda makes a very brief appearance, this appearance does prevent the possibility of mate on f1 because this will force a trade of rooks removing the Witch's partner in crime.  It will really be 2 bishops v 1 queen.  I will still wait a few more moves before waving that white flag.} Rxb8 40. Rxb8 Kxb8 41. gxf4 {41. gxf4 - I now remove one of Bob's pawns, there are still three black pawns on the board, however and I am really worried about the a pawn, especially as Henry is on the wrong side of the board.} Kb7 42. Be5 {42. Be5 - Fou Lenoir can defend both f and c pawns but alas not the a3 pawn.  I am just waiting for Qa1 here and QxP next move.  I will wait until he plays it before I wave that white flag though.} Qe3+ {42. ..... Qe3+ - the start of a bad plan that throws Bob into deep hot water.  I ask myself, is he threatening Qf3+?  If so, before I wave the white flag I will move Henry to h1 and await my fate.} 43. Kh1 Qf3+ {43. ....... Qf3+?? - Tempting, sooo very tempting, but just you look how that royal couple are neatly lined up on the h1-a8 diagonal.  Now that helplessly once pinned prelate Fou Leblanc now reads the last rites to the Wicked Witch by pinning her to her other half.  The best Bob can do is to play QxB but that will lead to a lost ending a piece and pawn to the bad.  It is Bob that now waves the white flag.   Commiserations and bad luck Bob.  I could have lost 15-16 rating points here and continued my Big Slump Part 2, but there but for the grace of God go I.  For what I have received in the name of 4.9 rating points O Lord Our Father I am truly thankful.  Amen.} 44. Bg2 {}
