1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {The way I usually start for an agressive game} d6 3. d4 {Attmepting to control the centre, rather than play a passive h6, or not so passive, but not as attacking Be2} f6 4. Bc4 {That hole he created with 1...e5 2...d6 I chose to try exploit} Bg4 {Too many times when that move is played against me, I would block with my bishop, and stop attacking, so I forced myself to ignore that, and play Qxf3, if black chose Bxf3} 5. Nc3 {Continues development} exd4 {That was the move I wanted him to play...it allows me to give the impression im recapturing instead of losing my Queen to Nxd4 Bxd1, but developing my Queen in order to explore the diagonal the White Bishop is on} 6. Qxd4 Nc6 {As expected, threatening the Queen to move, which was fine by me, thats not where i wanted it to end up} 7. Qd5 Qd7 {That i did not expect...was expecting either Nc6 (providing he didnt see Bc1's threat) or even better, Bh5, which was the move i had accounted for. 7...Bh5 8. g4 (taking the pawn would result in checkmate or 7...Bh5 8. g4 Bg6 9. Nh4, leaving his only option as Bf7, again checkmate....kinda annoyed at myself after going thru the lines that I missed Qd7, but anyway...this move was played and I began to re-avaluate} 8. Nd4 {I realised after some deliberation that Nd4, Nxd6 was a possibility for mate if he decided to take with the Queen, over his pawn structure, but knew it was unlikely, because he had only just played Qd7 for a reason} Bh5 9. Nxc6 {Thought id test it anyway, and probably in doing so, my biggest mistake of the game...here he offers his bishop on h5, when i glanced at it, I had the mindset of (if I capture that, I lose my horse, which I wanted to use for this move, so I left it. Not realising it checks the Black King and I can move straight back to d5 and still keep the threat is probably one of the things that keeps my rating low....just a result of not looking thoroughly before moving. I saw it before he moved Bf7, and yeah grr haha. } Bf7 10. Qxf7+ {After weighing up my options, I could not see a plasuible mate from my situation without taking that Bishop, my Knight was not in a position to attack, and the f6 pawn stops my Black Bishop from being able to help, so a little forced i felt, this move, Qxf7+} Qxf7 {His only move..} 11. Bxf7+ Kxf7 {After this I did stand a Knight up, so the outcome wasnt that bad, but mate was alot further away now, than the hige threat it stood as before, and I was now hoping he made a mistake or two so as not to draw the game out, or I could be regretting move 7 later on...} 12. Nd4 Re8 13. O-O {Here i had seen the Rooks placement, and I knew there was a fork on d6, but it was going to take planning, and a bit of luck with his moves to pull it off...} c5 {Perfect move for me, opening the d6 square for capture} 14. Nf5 {That looks like I'm moving away from capture, I find alot of moves for me, work well when I am doing things with one move...e.g capturing and developing, avoiding capture while developing or making a move he thinks is obvious, but has a hidden agenda behind it} b5 {??  Maybe he is setting up b4, threatening the Knight on c3, but that still doesnt seem like the smartest move} 15. Re1 {Here i had a feeling he hadnt seen the fork yet, and I thought if I capture b5, and then Re4, although that is a fork, it may be more obvious, so I decided to defend the pawn as if i was not thinking about a fork} b4 16. Nb5 {Again this looks good for me, he attacks, I 'move out the way' and simply move forwards instead of backwards...I'm liking this now} g6 {I thought for sure after 16. Nb5 he would see the fork, but I was wrong, and finally this second plan comes to light} 17. Nfxd6+ Bxd6 18. Nxd6+ Ke7 19. Nxe8 {That leaves me 6 points up in material, and I have a 3rd plan (this is really the first game where after my first plan fails, I materialised another one or two, I'm really really happy (with the expcetion of move 7) of how I played this game. Whats important to me, is that after my gameplan failed, due to a mistake of mine, I was able to make the best of it, and pull back before attacking again. The 3rd plan will come to light on move 21 or 22, but I told my opponent I wanted to annotate this game, so he may be reading this hehe...} Kxe8 20. Bf4 Ne7 21. e5 f5 {He saw that plan (wasnt a great one, lol)} 22. g4 Rf8 {In my opinion, the game was already over, but Black put up a good fight} 23. gxf5 Rxf5 24. Re4 Nd5 {This position, I analysed for quite a while, I know all too well, when things get a tad tight, if I make a mistake, it could all but cost me the game} 25. Bg3 Ke7 26. e6 h5 27. Rae1 {Black running out of both room and time...} g5 28. Re4e5 Rxe5 29. Rxe5 {Only a miracle can save Black..} Nc7 30. h4 {Ne4 was maybe an option? Yes White would have played hxg5 most likely, but Ne4 was still better in my opinion} gxh4 31. Bxh4+ Kd6 32. Bg3 Nxe6 {Also a good time to make the capture. Not much Black can do, but at least he isn't resigning. I find it difficult to develop my endgame, more than any part of my game, because so many resign when in a losing position. Im focusing on 'winning a won game' in the next month or so...} 33. Rxh5+ Kc6 34. f4 Ng7 35. Rh6+ Kb5 36. Rg6 Nf5 {Perhaps Black can make something out of White's poor pawn structure with his Knight and King? Give his pawns a chance? Through analysis, I knew they wouldnt get anywhere decent enough in time} 37. Be1 Ne3 38. Rg7 Nxc2 39. Re7 a6 40. f5 Nd4 41. f6 Nf5 42. f7 Nxe7 {Allowed the exchange, obviously, the pawn was about to reach f8, it was no matter now..} 43. f8=Q Nc6 44. b3 Na5 {Here White resigned, and fairly so, 5 moves away from mate as far as I could see, and Black wasnt in the game for most of the Match...  Thanks guys !}
