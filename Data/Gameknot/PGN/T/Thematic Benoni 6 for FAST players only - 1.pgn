[Opening "Benoni (A66), pawn storm variation"]

1. d4 {The Queen's pawn opening [A40]} Nf6 {Queen's pawn game [A45]. This flexible move is the most common reply for black, as the knight is almost always good on f6.} 2. c4 {Queen's pawn game [A50]. If there was a pawn on d5, this would be the queen's gambit, a very popular opening. } c5 {The benoni defense [A56], a sharp defense, and a favorite of mine. } 3. d5 {the beginning of a center fortress bunking d5 and e4 is built. } e6 {[A60] working into the main benoni structure. } 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 {white dominates the white squares in the center, black dominates the black squares, leading to sharp play. } g6 {Aiming to fianchetto the bishop on the very power, very open long diagonal. [A65]} 7. f3 {I play this move to give white a very solid structure and maximum flexibility for his pieces, (black's knight can't harass a bishop on e3, white's knight could potentially get to f2, etc...) } Bg7 8. Bg5 {This pin can get nasty fast for black, he must break it immediately. } h6 9. Be3 O-O 10. Qd2 Nbd7 {Black must be somewhat familiar with this structure: as he doesn't guard h6 because 11. Bxh6?  Nxe4! with equality. } 11. O-O-O {White aims to fire away at the black kingside} Kh7 {Better is h5, slowing white's pawn advances. This move is quite useless, actually. } 12. g4 b5 {The pawn is not free to take, black wants the B file open, but I felt confident my queen on d2 would halt any B file threats. Black's pieces are also very uncoordinated, not ready to attack. } 13. Bxb5 Qa5 14. g5 {I begin my attack, whittling away some of black's defensive pawns. } hxg5 15. h4 {If the H file opens, black faces certain death. } g4 {better was Nh5} 16. h5 g5 {Black is trying WAY too hard to keep the h file completely blocked. now the white h pawn becomes invasive...} 17. e5 {...but not before white cracks open the black center. } dxe5 18. h6 Bh8 19. Bd3+ e4 {moving the king leads to a heavy heavy loss of material } 20. Nxe4 {I'm not hesistant to trade queen's, my queen is shockingly less active than it's black counterpart, and I will win material regardless. } Qxd2+ 21. Nxd2+ Kg8 {now it's forced. } 22. h7+ Kg7 {the black king scampers around } 23. Bxg5 Nxd5 24. Be4 {Bh6  will still be around, as the pin is annoying for black. } Nd7b6 {A rather ignorant move, bb7 covers the knight just fine, but this flat out loses a rook, instead of what would have been an exchange. } 25. Bh6+ {Black sees his mistake and resigns. }
