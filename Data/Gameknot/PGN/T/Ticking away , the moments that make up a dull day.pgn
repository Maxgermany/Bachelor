[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 {My good friend Graeme and I are closing in on our 100th game against each other. I give blackbaron full credit for the game title:) Floyd, anyone?????????} c6 {Graeme's head would spontaneously combust if he played anything other than 1. e4 against me. Lately, I've been exploring the Caro Kann. I'm quite sure he expected 1...d5:)} 2. Nf3 {Heading into Two Knight's territory, which is giving me fits as I learn this system. Main line reflects 2. d4.} d5 {Consistent with the 1. c6 theme.} 3. e5 {A very interesting choice. White appears to want to lock down the pawn structures early. I was really expecting 3. Nc3.} Bg4 {Developing quickly and clearing d7 for my Nb8.} 4. d4 {Natural and good.} e6 {This is a prototypical pawn structure of a Caro Kann. At first glance (at least to me), it's just not that sexy. However, what this position lacks in pizzaz it more than makes up for with potential. Black can get fully developed relatively quickly and many times can delay castling or even forego castling very safely. This is definitely a defensive system for black.} 5. Be2 {I think I have correctly assumed that blackbaron is out of his comfort level as well. Since the Two Knights is not in effect, he simply hastens 0-0 with a good developing move. When you have played the same opponent so many times, you get a feel for his play. This is all new ground to us. The exciting part of chess is exploring new lines of play with cool adversaries:)} a6 {?! The first step in recovery is admitting you have a problem. I am continually PLAGUED by voices inside my head telling me to play moves like this. I opt to neglect development and prepare b5 because I feel the kingside can hold for a bit. Somebody.....please.......stop me! Is there a pill for this behavior?} 6. h3 {Putting the question to my bishop, which I feel is proper.} Bh5 {? BxN is seen so much more often in this position. At this point, I'm beginning to get worried about my own development. White is about to take a big lead in that department.} 7. Bf4 {Developing and preparing Nbd2.} Nd7 {My kingside is going to take a few moves to develop, so I entertain the idea of 0-0-0 and develop another piece. Backwards thinking? Maybe......} 8. Qd3 {?! this moves just feels awkward. It is just begging for 8...Bg6.} Rc8 {? But, of course, I don't see it and play yet another ridiculous move. It's almost as if I am intentionally playing bad moves. } 9. Nbd2 {As planned.} c5 {I go ahead and prosecute my idea of action on the c file. If he takes my kingside development question is answered. } 10. c3 {Of course, Graeme sees this and most certainly won't assist me in that endeavor. However.....} c4 {!? Cements some boundary lines on the queenside and threatens the enemy queen.} 11. Qc2 Ne7 {Racing to catch up in development. It's worth noting that this knight can now go either way.} 12. Kf1 {?? YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let me say a few words about Graeme. He's a Scotsman. This move was made at about 4 am his time, after he crawled back home from a night at the local pub. I won't include all of the language he used, but it is evident that he intended to play 0-0. Tragic drunken mouse slip. Sorry buddy.......} Ng6 {Being granted such a gift, I proceed to untangle my DSB with a developmental hit on his Bf4.} 13. Be3 {Interesting choice. This bishop is potentially weak as it is cramped. Perhaps Bh2 was worth a look?} Bxf3 {Practically forced, as g4 drops the piece.} 14. Bxf3 Be7 {Ok, it took long enough....now I can castle. This is kind of a natural pause in the game, so I start re-evaluating my plans. With my king safely tucked away I may be able to generate something on the queenside.} 15. b3 {! Even though I was wearing my special tin foil helmet, blackbaron reads my mind and chooses to hit me first on the queenside. Is it possible that he is comfortable with locking it down?} b5 16. bxc4 {Tired of my defensive posturing, Graeme instigates. It looks like we are about to start scrapping on the queenside.} bxc4 17. Rb1 {Claiming the open file.} O-O 18. Ke2 {Castling by hand so to speak and connecting his rooks.} Rb8 {! Perhaps my best move. I'm envisioning the board minus both queens and all four rooks. That would leave both of his bishops at least temporarily "bad".} 19. Rb2 {?! hmm......knowing blackbaron, he probably sees what I am up to. But why this? 19. RxR would allow his other rook to reside on b1 and still control the file.} Rxb2 {That's fine with me, and I proceed with my liquidation plans.} 20. Qxb2 Qb8 21. Rb1 Qxb2 22. Rxb2 Rb8 23. Rxb8+ Nxb8 24. a4 {White is going to have to answer the question of getting his bishops rolled over to the queenside.  The most fascinating part of this game is established by this move. Look at the one and only gate in the pawn chains. Who can get to it, and more importantly, get through it first?} Nf8 {Heading to the party.......} 25. Ke1 Nfd7 26. Bd1 Ba3 {Trying to get to b2.} 27. Nb1 {Repelling the intruder as Bb2 is met by Bd2.} Be7 28. g3 {Establishing a firmer footing on the kingside, and apparently waiting for me to make my plans clear.} Nc6 {Anticipating an eventual move to b3 if needed while getting off of the edge.} 29. f4 {More kingside posturing.} f6 {!? Threatening to rip up the kingside and opening another front.} 30. Bg4 {!? Eying my now weak e pawn with a check tempo.} f5 {Sorry sir, we are closed for business. Try again some other time.} 31. Be2 {?! Bd1 seems more active.} h6 {Since the groundwork has already been laid, I ensure no funny business on the kingside.} 32. h4 {! Further controlling b5.} Na5 {Ok....kingside seems safe. Let's go fishing...........} 33. Bc1 {Gaining more scope.} Nb3 {Mission accomplished for this little horsey. He is now nicely posted.} 34. Kd1 {Heading for the "gate in the fence".} Nxc1 {? Forgive me father, for I have sinned. Seriously, someone shoot me now.} 35. Kxc1 Nb8 {Starting yet another long trek to b3.} 36. Bd1 Nc6 37. Kb2 Na5 38. Na3 {Perhaps attempting to get to b4 via c2.} g5 {Since my DSB is still aiming towards the kingside, I feel it is safe to trade some pawns and cement the kingside before I entertain the idea of possibly trading off my bishop.} 39. hxg5 hxg5 40. Nc2 {hmmm.....now b4 AND e3 are launch platforms. What have I done?} g4 {Ok, let's keep it simple. I'll meet you at the "gate".} 41. Ne3 {?! Nb4 holds much more promise methinks. BxN, cxB hitting the Na5 looks good for white.} Kf7 42. Bxg4 {!? White is sick of this closed position and offers up a speculative sac. I can't say that it is altogether unsound, as it took me some time to figure out the position after my 56th move. } fxg4 43. Nxg4 Kg6 44. Ne3 Kh5 45. g4+ Kg6 46. f5+ Kf7 47. f6 Bf8 48. Kc2 Bh6 {! Preparing to trade down if allowed.} 49. Kd2 {?! Graeme opts to accept the trade down and hopes to escort a passer to promotion.} Bxe3+ 50. Kxe3 Nb3 51. g5 Nc1 52. Kd2 Nd3 {The true strength of black's position lies in the fact that this knight now has four cushy posts to operate from.} 53. a5 {Either king breaking through on the queenside is now highly improbable.} Nf4 {Time to pick up a pawn.} 54. Ke3 Nh3 55. Kd2 Nxg5 56. Kc2 {Critical position here for black, and it took me some thinking as to how to proceed. Either my king or my knight is going to have to babysit against the threat of promotion. Graeme and I have a lot of draws under our belts, but I want this one:)} Ke8 57. Kb2 Ne4 58. Kc2 Kd7 {Can't travel too far........} 59. Kb2 Ng5 60. Ka3 {Can he be trying to infiltrate c5? To what end?} Kc7 61. Ka4 Nf7 62. Kb4 Nd8 {! Still protecting f7 and preparing to throw a check if needed.} 63. Kc5 Nb7+ 64. Kb4 Kd7 {Back to babysitting.} 65. Ka4 Ke8 66. Kb4 Kf7 67. Ka4 Nd6 {! I spent an hour or so on this one. If he takes, his f pawn falls first followed by his d6 pawn after Kf7, and rushing pawns up the board allows my king to get to his a pawn while he defends. That position, however is most likely drawn. In playing this move, I almost concede the draw.} 68. Ka3 {I think my opponent gives me too much credit:)} Ne4 69. Kb2 Kg6 {A waiting move, as I have now calculated out the pawn captures after I sac my knight.} 70. Kc2 Nxf6 {! Ok buddy, let's just cut to the chase........} 71. Kd2 {? Loses the game. Again, I think my opponent got too wrapped up in my game, and failed to see that a draw was still very possible. The rest of the game is pretty straightforward.} Ne4+ 72. Kc2 Ng5 73. Kd2 Kf5 74. Ke3 Ne4 75. Ke2 Nxc3+ 76. Kd2 Nb5 77. Ke3 c3 {"A passed pawn is a thing of joy forever" That was Keats, wasn't it?} 78. Kd3 Kf4 79. Kc2 Ke3 80. Kd1 Na3 81. Kc1 Kd3 82. Kd1 c2+ 83. Kc1 Nb5 84. Kb2 Kd2 85. Kb3 c1=Q 86. Kb4 Qc3+ 87. Ka4 Qa3# {Many thanks to my old friend for the game, and I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas}
