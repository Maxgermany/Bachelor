1. d4 d5 {I don't really like Queen Pawn openings but went with it} 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bg5 {The dreaded pin, which was expected hence 2. e6} Nc6 5. e3 b6 {Looking to finachetto as my pawn one6 is blocking development and I thought the pawn on d5 would be exchanged} 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. Qa4 Bd6 {Trying to get George to safety before the fight begins} 8. cxd5 exd5 {Exchange} 9. Nxd5 Be7 {Here I only tried to keep some integrity in my position and had to defend with the bishop, taking with the G pawn would force me to castle to the queen sided. If he then exchanged on c3 the a7 pawn would possibly not hold} 10. Nb4 {He backs of which was a mistake because b4 is under double attack....} Bxb4+ {And there is check included in the deal so I am taking over the iniciative} 11. Nd2 O-O {Finally getting the King out of the way to free up the knight on c3 if needed} 12. Bb5 {This would have been a nice pin before 11. O-O, now it is only a menace as I saw he could not swing the momentum back even if I had to play Qd7 later on to defend} Bxd2+ {Keeping up the pressure with the intention to break the pin on f4 by his bishop, so I had to draw the king out from the back rank} 13. Kxd2 Ne4+ {Here my opponent resigned, I would be up another piece no matter what he played.  I was hoping he would play a greedy blunder for the poetic sacrifice to stop the mate 14. d3 Qxg5 15. Kxe4 Nb4+ 16. Bc6 Bxc6+ 17. Qxc6 Nxc6 but I was happy to take the win none the less.}
