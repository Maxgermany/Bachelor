1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petrov's defense...} 3. Nxe5 {Not recommended...} Qe7 {Nxe4 doesn't work out well for black.} 4. d4 d6 {I force my point.} 5. Nc4 Qxe4+ {Naturally...} 6. Qe2 d5 {!} 7. Ne5 Bf5 {I develop.} 8. Be3 {? Now I can play...} Qxc2 {Up a pawn, but...} 9. Qb5+ {Hmm...} Nc6 10. Qb3 {??} Qxb3 11. axb3 Bb4+ {!} 12. Nc3 Nxe5 {I am not about to undouble his pawns, besides this pin will prove useful...} 13. dxe5 Ne4 {Attacking the pinned piece...} 14. Bd2 Nxd2 {Need to maintain the pin...} 15.

Rd1+ {? Better would have been Ra1...} Ke7 23. Ra1 {Only way to prevent mate...} Rc2+ {There should be a little bubble over the rook. Can you tell what this rook is thinking? He waited out the three minutes and timed out.}
