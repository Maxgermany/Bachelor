1. e4 e5 {I dedicate this game to my brothers of the King Apostles team, and particular to Captain Big Paul...through the building of this new team, and his ongoing encouragement my chess skill has expanded 10 fold.  I have more arrows in my quiver, and I play a more quieted pace and watch the board more calmly which provides me with better options...often times the first option is not the best.  Psalm 46:10 reminds us "Be still, and know that I am God".  Let us rest, for in rest we may see another option......  Please enjoy this game. --Capt_Rook} 2. Bc4 Nc6 {1.  Started with the basic King Pawn's open....I wasn't quite sure what to do with the bishop coming out...was thinking the Ruy was coming...so I just stuck to the plan and deveoped my Knight.  If the queen were to follow I was hoping for the basic king queen fork, or king rook fork that so often you can get when someone tries the scholars mate.} 3. d3 Nf6 {3.  I keep deveoping.....} 4. Nf3 Bc5 {4.  game progressing pretty normal......} 5. h3 d6 6. Ng5 O-O {6.  Interesting move here by mesk....I spent some time thinking about it, and did not see this as a threat.  I did see the possible Queen coming out, but figured it would cost to much (loss of Knight) do be affactive...the Queen on its own while a menace, is rarely fatal.  THere fore I decide to castle so that I don't get forked here.   [personal scared level = low ]} 7. c3 Be6 {7.  Ok, his pawn move at first I didn't understand, but then saw that it thwarts any further knight deveopment, I no longer trust his bishop on c4, I am ready for a trade and to make some room in the middle.} 8. Bxe6 fxe6 {8.  Ok, I did play this out a few moves....and did not see this next move at all. (I actually got burned on this same tatic today on another game, I'll need to watch for this in the future)  I truly never saw this fork coming.} 9. Nxe6 {9.  There she is, a true thing of beauty...if you are mesk.  As Captain BigPaul pointed out this is a triple threat..even as I look at it I just see Queen and Rook...someone is going down.  [personal scared level = HIGH]  I am pretty sure the game is lost...not sure what to do.} Bxf2+ {9. [cont]  I can't say my earier moves were a trap...I am not that good.  But when backed into a corner, sometimes you just have to start swinging.  I didn't expect the end result that I got here, but figured maybe I could get our of this with only a small flesh wound.  Lets give up 3 points rather than 5 or 9 here.} 10. Kxf2 Nxe4+ {10.  FREE MOVE for me.  A few favorite tatics of mine come out in this game...the discovered check is one of the best...I knew I had a free move, but wasn't exactly sure what to do with it...I figure maybe I get one more point back....  [personal scared level = HIGH]  I still haven't removed the Rook/Queen fork...and I know I can't keep him in perpetual check....or can I.....  :)  10 Nxe4  or Ng4  were the only moves that saved my Rook.  Just a discoved check wouldn't of saved my dear friend...and we all know how I love my Rooks.} 11. Ke2 Qh4 {Ok at this point I am starting to get excited...I see a few Checkmates if I can just get the right move.  I am actually hoping for my Rook bait to force the knight to jump....which will result in Checkmate with Qf2.  [personal scared level is replaced with the [personal excitement level = HIGH]...maybe actually too high....I have to slow down and not let me blunder right back.} 12. Be3 Rf2+ {12 Excellent move by mesk, I can't say I total saw that...he protects the f2 square a bit longer and maybe makes an escape hole for his King.  He doesn't take the bait sitting on f8.  This is a little victory for me here, both of my forked comrades are now free...that knight is now all alone.  I must confess, my focus here became revenge on the knight...I was thinking of discovered checks that would get me to take down the knight..........thankfully I resisted.} 13. Ke1 Rxg2+ {King to e1 is the only available option for Mesk...and sets up my first ever windmill tactic.  I've you are unfamilar I invite you to read some of Yessir's Winning Chess books.....Winning tactics is the one where I first read about it.....until this move I have NEVER been able to recreate the opportunity.....   Nice and simple...you work back and forth round and round with your Rook and Queen (or normally a bishop) and you get to take just about any piece you want.....pace your self the windmill is meal served over many courses.} 14. Kf1 Rf2+ 15. Ke1 Rd2+ {15.  Here the game ends before dessert can be served.  Did I see this coming back at moves 6 and 7.  Absolutely not.  Honestly I was scared and lucky to pull this off.  If my f7 pawn had not been moved in move 8, I would of surely lost my Rook and maybe more.   A very fun game in the end because I was able to keep looking at the board and see something that I hadn't seen before.  Thanks for readying....I hope you enjoyed it, and enjoyed a bit of my humor.  I tip my hat to my good friend and opponent Meskalander.....he saw the shot and took it, no fault in that.  We've had a few games together now and he is a truly worthy advesary.}
