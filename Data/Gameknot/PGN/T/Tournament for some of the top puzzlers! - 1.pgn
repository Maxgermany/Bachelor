[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A46)"]

1. d4 {The Queen's Pawn Open I did with Blitzkov (aka Well Water, or, on a more personal note, William Campbell). This game was initiated by an unnamed individual who wanted us to play a "mini tournament" against each other.  The genre was "Top Puzzlers" and I sort of hated being asked to participate but I did.   With research into Blitzkov as my challenge as me being White I felt it was best to do the Queen's Game (that I learned from Boris Spassky back in the much earlier days against Bobby Fischer) for maneuverability and immediate Classical play (I could have used e4 open but after reviewing the history of William Campbell I felt a Queen's Game would "stretch" his ability to respond) and so CLASSICAL I PLAY.  What will Blitzkov do now? I don't really care. I am already in Classical position by pushing d4!} Nf6 {The expected response from anyone in Black against the d4 White open.   } 2. Nf3 {Usually it should have been c4 here, but often I like to make moves that go astray from the usual to gain position. This is a good response but I am wandering away from the usual path here.  I know William (blitzkov) does his own extensive research. I am not satisfied with the usual route in dealing with him.  } d5 {A sort of Nimzo move here without e6 prior. } 3. c4 {My decision to finally show c4, which is common in this attack. } g6 {His decision to go King's Indian Defense instead of Nimzo Attack.... He will fianchetto and to date blitzkov seems to like fianchettos. } 4. Nc3 {Now we are back to the Classical formation after some dilly dallying to get there. This knight usually comes out after c4 where it is in the Queen's open.  To me, Black is now doing a King's Indian Defense here. It appears later in the game but it dissolves into classical formation(s).  I've always said pay attention to the Classical Opens and Classical Defenses.  All the rest digest back into Classical Chess.  There is no such thing as anything new that was developed after the Classical.  William is doing fine here.} Bg7 {The expected fianchetto. } 5. Qb3 {Developing my Queen out of sitting and doing nothing. } dxc4 {exchange time } 6. Qxc4 {Queen forward. Again. Instead of sitting. Or getting trapped into submission. Never treat a lady that way! } O-O {I believe, personally, it is a problem when you castle your king under a fianchetto. It is formed by breaking the "box" the King in a 0-0 should be safe in. It will lead to problems. } 7. e4 {Infantry (LIGHT) moving forward. IN (LIGHT) are designed to "fix and kill" in the US Army. } a6 {Not his queen or bishop or knight but a foot pawn (IN (LIGHT)) that he moves on the edge of the board as if it is a safe thing to do instead of a "fix and kill" for the noble pawn. } 8. Be2 {I am clearing house for 0-0. } b5 {He attacks my Queen which is the most powerful piece on the board. The Queen loves a fight. Treat your ladies that way and you'll be married to a Queen! } 9. Qb3 {I retreat her. There is nothing wrong with this move. She can go a lot of places here or just "sit" to threaten. } Nc6 {A knight comes out and I can see the threat to attack my maneuverable Queen.  No problem. } 10. d5 {I advance IN (LIGHT) to push that knight to either attack or retreat.  I don't care what that knight wants to do. In the meantime I am pushing my noble pawns (LIGHT INFANTRY) forward to fix and kill. } Na5 {As expected. You must always anticipate ahead of time. You must always see where a knight or bishop (especially in the "middle game" or earlier) can go.  Just spend a bit of time and don't get spooked.  } 11. Qa3 {I decide it is okay to keep her here on the left flank.  Here she is on the line and not retreating.  Her King is proud of her. She fights fiercely and holds the line against threats. No wonder this King loves her. } Nb7 {The Black knight goes back a couple ranks.  Knights can do this and still be very dangerous! } 12. Bxb5 {A bishop is, in our puzzle section here, a very fascinating piece. The bishop can control two diagonals like a Queen and also help out to prevent a pawn taking what seems like a good deal.  However, if the pawn takes the bishop the forward deployed Queen will take the rook. } e6 {A diversion here from my bishop and Queen attacking on my left flank (his right flank).  Perhaps I shall entertain the diversion but the fact is he is already in trouble on his right flank.   } 13. dxe6 Bxe6 {It seems logical but I have something in mind to take this guy (blitzkov) to the wood shed. I shall choose the Willow Wand that is very flexible and capable of hurting with pain! } 14. Bc6 {A pinning operation. His retreated knight is pinned against the more valuable rook.  Always think about pinning a piece to a more valuable piece! } Qc8 {Clearly on the defense still.  Being one pawn ahead means nothing. I sacrifice pawns on occasion to gain position.  However, blitzkov's position is declining into protecting his own. } 15. Bg5 {I "felt" good about this move. It was not astounding but it did put my Q bishop into action. As well, it cleared all for 0-0 or 0-0-0 or what have you.  My feeling is when someone is in retreat or protecting his or her own it is okay to advance with more force. In the US Army this kind of maneuver is called "Economy of Force."} h6 {Of course! } 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 17. e5 Bg7 18. Rd1 {I could have castled the rook to this position, but at this point it is pointless.  The King is a fighting piece and always should be recognized as a fighting piece.  If I have to ensconce him I have 0-0 to do that.....} a5 19. O-O {So I do.  I hated doing this but I will not suffer from underestimating my opponent.  I have to make sure the King is safe as Bobby Fischer said as a rule. And who is better than Bobby around here today?} Rb8 20. Nd5 Bxd5 21. Rxd5 Qe6 22. Nd4 {This is where Black's Queen gets into unexpected trouble. } Qg4 23. f4 {The Infantry (LIGHT) is "fixing" for the kill. } Nd8 24. Bd7 Ne6 25. h3 Qh5 {Time for closing the ranks with the assistance (already) of the "fix and kill" Infantry (LIGHT). } 26. Nxe6 fxe6 27. Bxe6+ Kh8 28. Bg4 {She's a fixed and killed goner now! } Qh4 29. g3 {Lose the queen you lose the game.  Blitzkov was finally brought to the wood shed with a willow wand to have a bit of hands on discipline.  }
