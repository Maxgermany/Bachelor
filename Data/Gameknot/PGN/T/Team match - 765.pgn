1. e4 e5 {This is rather a risky defence, putting the horse on c6 wpould not leave an opening.} 2. Qh5 {sp tries to intimidate, but getting the queen out so early is not wise...} Nf6 {awwwww, attacking the queen is a good idea, but you should have defended the pawn, he was clearly going after it} 3. Qxe5+ {see?} Be7 {good, developing and defending at the same time} 4. g4 {very agressive and intimidating, I would get rid of that queen first} Nxg4 {if oyu move the horse away FROM somewhere, look at the pieces you leave undefended!} 5. Qxg7 {see?} Bf6 {taking the horse I guess..} 6. Qxg4 {right.} d6 {good move} 7. Qd1 {the sneaky b**** plays safe} Nc6 {developing} 8. f4 {you should be able to work with this, the king is exposed} Nd4 {OH NO!!!

Qf3 {I you don't counterattack, they will come to get you} Be5 12. d4 Bd7 13. dxe5 dxe5 {this is just getting yourself into trouble!

Qh5+ {oF COURSE, He sees the holes in YOUR defence} Ke7 {desperate trouble now} 16. Bc4 Bc6 17. Qf7+ Kd6 18. Qe6+ Kc5 19. Be3+ Qd4 20. cxd4+ exd4 21. Bf2 Bb5 22. Qd5+ Kb4 23. a3+ Ka4 24. Qxb5# {}
