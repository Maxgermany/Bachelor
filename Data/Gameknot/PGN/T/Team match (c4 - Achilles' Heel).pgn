1. e4 {Here is a recent team game vs. my good friend and rival team captain (and the only guy I know who spends more time on GK than me:), achilles13. With the black pieces, I employ a Najdorf Sicilian vs. his 1. e4, and a pretty clean middle game is reached with both sides fairly equal. Unexpectedly, my opponent decided to sac a piece giving him a 3-1 queenside pawn majority which threatened to wreak havoc. Luckily, I was able to block his advance utilizing my piece advantage and some pretty good coordination of my forces. The thing I liked most about this game is that my king was used in a very offensive role and I was fortunate enough to have my pieces accomplishing multiple tasks with minimal movement. Thanks to achilles13 for the good game! I hope you enjoy:)} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {And here is the typical Najdorf variation of the Sicilian defence. I have only recently grown the stones to start playing the Sicilian. I am 36 years old, and have been playing chess for about 25 years. Trust me when I tell you that I have played 10's of thousands of games in my life (including the ridiculous 6500 something here on GK). Of all of those games, I would guess that only in a few hundred have I played 1...c5 vs. 1. e4. For those that know me, I'm a Scandanavian player. I have realized (finally!) that I am entirely too predictable, so I have put a few of my fears to rest and have started branching out some. To me, the Sicilian has always represented some of the most scary (yet oddly thrilling) aspects of playing with the black pieces. There are just too many variations that can arise, and I have always tried to steer towards more simple, straight-forward opening lines. In doing some reading (and also going through some great annotations right here on GK), I have decided to tackle the Najdorf. Hopefully with some practice, I can safely add it to my repitoire and not feel suicidal in doing so.......} 6. Be3 {After a standard opening, white develops and throws a protective hit on his Nd4. As my own "book knowledge" of the Najdorf is still a book with only one page in it, I can't yet find a lot of fault with this move. 6. Bf4 is the move I probably would have chosen, however, as it exerts more control over the dark squares. I only mention this because when I have the white pieces, no one ever gets the chance to play the Najdorf against me because I play 1. d4 almost exclusively. (***note to self*** A. Only ONE major change at a time. Once you're comfortable with the Sicilian, try playing something else as white, B. Quit telling the world about your tendancies - if you need catharsis then go get a shrink:)} e5 {Establishing a central presence and preparing the aggressive 7...Bb4 pin.} 7. Nf3 {7. NxN bxN 8. Bc4 also appears to very solid for white. Once again, I'm not questioining this move...it is just a little more passive than I would have played.} Bb4 {As planned, and castling is now possible.} 8. Bd2 {Practically forced. achilles and I have played numerous times, and he knows good and well that I will not hesitate for a moment to trade bishop for knight if I can straddle him with doubled isolani after 8...BxN. At this point I feel pretty good with my position, and as objectivly as possible I give black a small edge here. The two things I am concerned about are my awkward d pawn and a potential hole on d5, however. My d pawn is obviously destined to support my e pawn, but once it gets to d6 it is potentially weak.} d6 {Maintaining clear lines for development and supporting e5. If this joker is weak now or not I don't know. What I do know is that rapid development in support of my aim to maintain tempo and initiative are all important. If I have to address the "problems" of my d pawn later then so be it.} 9. Bd3 {!achilles sees 9...BxN 10. BxB Nxe so he develops, shores up his e pawn, and prepares to castle. A nice multi-tasking move.} Bg4 {Aggressive and natural. 9...Be6 was way to passive. White must now contend with a very annoying pin.} 10. h3 Bh5 11. O-O Bg6 {Here I had a change of plan. While pinning my opponents Nf3 against his queen was nice, I envision activity on e4 and am concerned about my own safety should I castle kingside. Paranoid? I don't think so....he IS trying to kill me:)} 12. Re1 {White hits e4 as well and prepares to open up the middle lanes on the board.} O-O {Securing my king and getting him off of the dangerous e file.} 13. a3 {White wants to expand on the queenside and gain some space.} Ba5 {?! I seriously considered BxN, but experience has taught me that achilles is very dangerous when he has the bishop pair. I decide to keep my dark squared bishop on the board and give him his space.} 14. b4 Bb6 15. Nd5 {I encounter the first real challenge caused by that d5 hole I mentioned earlier.} Nxd5 {Obviously I cannot allow an enemy knight to be posted so sweetly in my territory, so I remove it........} 16. exd5 {.....only to be faced with a new challenge. If I move my attacked knight, he will surely play BxB which will affect my castled position in a potentially ugly way. So.......} Bxd3 {! This guy goes first. I see that I am about to lose a pawn after 17. dxN Bf5 18. cxb, but I'm pretty confident I can get it back with little effort.} 17. dxc6 {Of course....} Bf5 18. cxb7 Ra7 {18...Rb8 was also an option, but this way I can get more power vertical quickly. The c file appears as if it is going to be where all of the fireworks are going to occur, so I want to claim it as fast as I can.} 19. c3 {? Rc1 was better perhaps.} Rxb7 20. Be3 {! Notice white's queenside pawns. White hopes to remove the dark squared bishops from the board to better preserve them.} Qc7 {I realize what achilles is trying to do. At this point, I'm pretty sure he will get what he wants - but I'm certainly not going to help him do it. I spend my tempo loading up on the c file.} 21. Bxb6 Rxb6 22. Rc1 {And the race commences for c file dominance.} Rc6 23. Qd2 Rc8 24. Re3 {While white cannot control the whole c file, he CAN control c3. This is a somewhat unconfortable square for his rook, however.} Be6 {Eying the c4 square, which is just screaming to be used as "blocking" square.} 25. Ng5 {I was a little confused by this move. I figured white would try to get his knight to c4 by Ne1, Nd3, Nb2.....} Bc4 26. Ne4 {?! OK achilles.....what are you up to?!?!?!?!?!?} d5 27. Nc5 {! I can't believe I didn't anticipate this.} e4 28. Nxe4 {!? This is the telling move of the game. I can only assume that white feared my strong central pawns that would easily be reinforced by my big artillery, so he sacs his knight to remove them. I began thinking that this was a huge mistake on my opponent's part. Then I realized that if he could somehow negate my control of c4 I could have some serious problems due to his 3-1 pawn majority. This going to be a very interesting endgame!} dxe4 29. Rxe4 Be6 {Still controlling c4 by hitting it this time instead of occupying it. I was also a little wary of my back rank so I closed down his access to it via the e file.} 30. Re3 {c4 is still his weakness.} Rc4 {! Notice how this move paralyzes white's position. ALL of white's pieces are locked down protecting c3.} 31. Rd1 {White sees the chance of a back row mate!} g6 {Chance favors the prepared:)} 32. Rc1 {Back to guard duty:(} Qd7 {?! And here is where I started listening to the demented, confused little voices in my head. I rationalized that every time I took heat off of c3, so could he. I debated and debated. I finally figured that the tiny material advantage I had may just be enough to win - but it would require my king to put on his gloves and get into the ring. If I didn't have my a pawn on the board I would not have considered this. I mentally took all four rooks and both queens off of the board. That would leave my bishop vs. his three pawns - which is a pretty equal fight. However, his king could reach the action before me, so the presence of my a pawn gave me the fortitude to attempt this trade down of material. Risky.....but exciting chess!} 33. Qxd7 {achilles goes for the idea......I wonder if he was thinking what I was?} Bxd7 34. Rd1 Be6 35. Rc1 h5 {I had every intention of protecting my half of the board by playing this move. It also protects some space for my king to operate in. But I did not anticipate how valuable this move was until a few more moves transpired.} 36. f3 {Opening a lane for his king to enter the fray.} Kg7 37. Kf2 Kf6 38. Kg3 h4+ {! Nice! By forcing my opponent back I gain valuable space and maintain initiative.} 39. Kf2 Kf5 40. g3 g5 41. Rd3 {This rook is so very constricted........} hxg3+ {? Quite possibly a mistake. This move does straddle white with isolated pawns, but they are amply protected and his king gets back into the fight for the control of space.} 42. Kxg3 Kg6 {Clearing f5 for the f pawn.} 43. Re3 {White has little other choice here. The protection of c4 is STILL killing him.} Rh4 {! And I finally see the way to pick up an isolani.} 44. Rh1 Rch8 {That's 3 hits to 2 on h3:)} 45. Re4 {White attempts to confuse the issue........} Rh4xh3+ {......but I'm having none of that. I pick up a pawn and immediately get the chance to trade down a bit further.} 46. Rxh3 Rxh3+ 47. Kg2 Rh4 {Now I of course offer to take achilles up on his previous offer.} 48. Re3 {My good friend is far too shrewd for that, so we continue to grind it out.} Kf5 49. Kg3 Rf4 {Looking to trade pawns on g4.} 50. a4 {I kind of figured that white would move Re2 or Re1 with the intent of gaining more scope for his lone remaining piece. } g4 51. b5 {White goes for broke in a desperate attempt to promote.} Rxa4 {It is safe to pick off this pawn, as my bishop can safely reach d5 to protect b7.} 52. b6 Bd5 53. fxg4+ Rxg4+ {The 4th rank has been a line in the sand that white just has not been able to cross.} 54. Kf2 Rg2+ {! In and of itself, this move is not exceptional by any means....} 55. Kf1 Rc2 {....but it does lead to this one!} 56. Rd3 {I'm sure achilles had a good smirk and a laugh as he played this last move before resigning:) Thanks again Natalino for the good game. At last count, Southern Chess only needs another 134 just like that one to even up our team score with your Fighting Warriors;)}
