1. f4 {My last game in what for me has been an interesting and exciting tournament, and a win that ensures my final place 'in the points'. Action starts at move 9.} d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 {The first 6 moves are forced to the starting position. Up to here is pretty much forced or White has too high a material defecit. Black could try ...Ke8 but as white wants the king in the open he can threaten a 3-fold repetition draw with Bf7. ...Kd6 is not an option because Bf7+ wins the queen back.} Bg7 10. Ne6 Qg8 {The favoured moves for both sides at this point in the tournament - The bishop controls the long diagonal, and the queen defends it. White is down in material so shouldn't be looking for exchanges. Black is restricted in movement so White needs to develop ASAP and attack the open king before black can un-tangle his pieces.} 11. d4 {My favoured next move as white - Either black must accept that his bishop is cut off, or he takes exd e.p. and the advanced pawn is out of my way when I reply with cxd.} exd3 e.p. {The usual response, and the one I was hoping for.} 12. cxd3 {And I have an open file in front of his king. Now I need to work on getting my knight and bishop moving, or, as happened in an earlier game, if black plays the knight to a6, I will try tempting it forward, perfectly willing to swap it for my inactive bishop and activating the rook, possibly with check if the king remains there.} h5 13. Bh3 {Forced as the knight must stay defended, and remain on his lovely outpost. Bf3+ allows the king to escape via d7. I want my bishop to cut off that route when the knight eventually has to move, or threaten a discovered check if the king tries to escape early.} b6 {So the king is trying to escape that way?} 14. g3 {Giving my bishop the option of both diagonals, and threatening to win a rook should the king retreat to b7. This is really an empty threat as after Bxa8, ...c6 locks my bishop out of the game. I need my pieces active.} Na6 {That knight is probably aiming to shift mine by going to c5, or aiming for d3 or c2 via b4.} 15. d4 {So as mentioned earlier, don't give him c5, tempt him to b4. } Nb4 {And he obliges.} 16. Na3 {Now, I can't afford to lose the rook, but I'm more than happy to let him swap knight for bishop if he so wishes. This also gets my other knight into play, and I'm looking for possible openings on his king. I'm now hoping for ...Nd3+.} Nd3+ 17. Ke2 {This series of moves has served me well in previous games. Now hoping the knight for bishop exchange will prove too tempting, as black may feel that exchanges are good for his material advantage.} Nxc1+ {And it does!} 18. Raxc1+ {So I exchange off an active knight for a very restricted bishop, and bring something a bit more powerful into the action, with eyes on the c pawn and a rook on the 7th. Judging by comments in the game, I think Bob started to feel a bit uncomfortable here.} Kb7 19. Rxc7+ {Rook to the 7th rank with tempo, and another rook soon to back it up.} Ka6 20. Rhc1 {This was to be my reply whichever way Blacks king has gone. Now looking at possibilities involving saccing my knight with Nc5+, or bringing a rook c6 before Nc5+.} Qf7 {Presumably trying to release the h8 rook.} 21. Rc1c6 {I decided against Nc5+ as black didn't have to capture it, and if he chose not to it would have got in my way. Also, I still like it where it is, keeping that queen at bay.} Bxd4 22. Nxd4 {Not sure why Black finally decided to trade off his bishop for that pawn - it may give the queen more freedom, but can he really afford to lose a piece and allow another of mine closer to his king?} Rhd8 23. Be6 {Be5! - I believe this wins for White. Either black loses the queen for a bishop, or it's mate in 5.} Qg7 {Black chose to save the queen, presumably not seeing the next series of moves.} 24. Bc4+ Ka5 {Forced.} 25. Nb3+ Kb4 {Forced, as Ka4 leads to Bb5#.} 26. Nc2+ Ka4 {Forced.} 27. Nc5+ Ka5 {Either this, or ...bxc5 which is answered with Ra6#.} 28. b4# {A nice little mating combination I think. Thanks for the games Bob.}
