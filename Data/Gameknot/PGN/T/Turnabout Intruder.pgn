[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D00)"]

1. d4 {Midway into this game, white had the advantage of piece, position, and tempo.  White could exert strong influence on black's side of the board.  However, through a few false moves, white allowed black to turn back his intrusions into the black side.  Once black gained the upper hand, black was able to threaten mate and force white to resign.} d5 2. h3 Nc6 3. e3 {White opens with a defensive position instead of with offensive moves.} Nf6 4. c3 {Another defensive move by white.  A major disadvantage to playing defensively is allowing the opponent to push forward and hence push back one's own pieces.  The result is that a defensive player gets boxed inside his own pawns.} a6 5. c4 {This seems odd.  Why move pawn two steps in two moves when white could have just moved the pawn two steps in the first move.  Every move counts during initial development, and the prior move seems like a wasted action.} dxc4 6. Bxc4 e6 7. Nf3 Bd6 8. Nc3 {Much better development now for both sides.  Each side is just one move away from castling - and has enough pieces in place to launch tactical strikes.} O-O 9. e4 b5 {Seeing how the e4 pawn is protected only by the knight on c3, if I can push a pawn forward and coax the knight off c3, I can take the e4 pawn for free.  The first step is to scare the bishop on c4 away.} 10. Bb3 {The bishop went to b3.  A stronger move is to pull the bishop back to d3.  With the bishop on d3, white could have protected the e4 pawn and once the queen is on c2, white can push the e4 pawn towards the knight on f6.  Once that knight is out of the way, white's bishop can take out the h7 pawn for free and expose black's king.} b4 {Now the pawn gets to scare the knight away.} 11. e5 {Ah!  Good move.  White responds to one threat with a counter-threat.} bxc3 {Black has two basic choices - either play aggressively or defensively. Aggressively is to take out the knight on c3 and disrupt white's pawn structure.  Defensively is to to move the d6 bishop or f6 knight to safety.  Since both knight and bishop are threatened by the same piece, any safety is just an illusion since the safety of one means the death of the other.  If white's pawn captures either black's bishop or knight, the pawn is left undefended on the next move.  Seeing that - and seeing a way to disrupt white's own pawn structure - the best defense is a good offense!  Black's pawn removes the knight.} 12. exd6 {Now the choice is either take out another defensive pawn of white's or take out the offensive white pawn on d6.  Better to take out the white d6 pawn with the c7 pawn in order to have a good pawn structure for defense later.  In this move, the best offense (later) is a good defense (now).} cxd6 13. bxc3 {Black now has a slight advantage in pawn position.  White has 3 pawn islands, while black has only 2.} d5 {Push the d pawn forward to keep the white bishop away.} 14. Bg5 {Excellent move by white.  The knight is pinned to protect the queen.  I suspect white intended this all along when he took out black's bishop on move 12.} Bb7 15. Qd3 Nb8 16. Bc2 {White obviously intends to get the black knight away from where it can guard the h7 pawn and then mate the king by capturing that pawn with the queen.} Nbd7 {Time to bring in reinforcements for the besieged f6 knight.} 17. Ne5 {Clever.  White is threatening the black c6 knight's reinforcement.} g6 {This move removes the threat of a checkmate by the queen capturing the h7 pawn.  However, it will eventually lead to white gaining a piece since white can take out the knight on d7 and if black recaptures the d7 square with the queen, the unlucky knight on c6 is left unprotected by anybody.} 18. Nxd7 Qxd7 19. Bxf6 {White is now ahead by 3 points.} Bc6 20. O-O {White might be ahead by a piece, but black has a plan to reduce that advantage.  White's queen and a rook are on the same diagonal.  White's bishop can take advantage of that alignment to skewer the rook.} Bb5 {White's queen is force to move off the diagonal and leave the white rook on f1 exposed.} 21. Qg3 Bxf1 22. Qh4 {Instead of recapturing the bishop, white moves the queen in for another attempt at checkmate.  White threatens to move the queen to h6 and thence to g7.} h5 {This pawn move is the only way to keep the queen away.  I feared white would respond with pawn to g4, and after a pawn exchange threaten mate once again.} 23. Qg5 {This was not a good move.  White gave away an opportunity at mate by moving the queen here instead of moving the g pawn forward by two.} Kh7 {White's king must move to protect the h6 square from intrusion by the queen.} 24. Bxg6+ {Another bad move.  White sacrifices a bishop for naught.  Black can respond by taking the g6 bishop with the f pawn and thereby open the file for the black rook.} fxg6 {Now white is down a piece and a pawn.  His remaining bishop is threatened.} 25. Rxf1 {Okay, so white somewhat evens the score and is only down a pawn.  If white had not taken the black bishop on this move, I might have pulled the bishop back to d3 and then placed it on f5 to guard the two pawns on e and g columns.} Qf7 26. Be5 {The black queen scared the white bishop back.} Qf5 {Now the black queen tries to scare the white queen away from the king.} 27. Qe7+ {Nope, the white queen is not scared away. Instead, she goes on the offensive behind enemy lines.} Qf7 {Black once again tries to force a queen exchange to protect the king.  An alternate move was moving the f8 rook to f7 to convince the white queen to flee to the queen side of the board.  The disadvantage of that move is that the black rooks are no longer giving each other mutual support.} 28. Qh4 {The queen flees at last.} Rac8 {Black threatens to pick off an easy pawn and move a rook to where it can influence events behind white's pawn line.} 29. g4 {Nice move, but it comes 6 moves too late.  Black need not fear white pawn taking the h5 pawn this time since black has a pawn a queen defending it. Also, if white takes it, and black retakes h5 with the g6 pawn, the g column is completely open to a rook attack on white's king.} Rxc3 {Black ignores the pawn threat against h5 and picks off the free pawn on c3.} 30. gxh5 {Now black must respond to the white pawn on h5.  If h5xg6+!, then white gets a double check against black's king and the pawn gets to fork queen and king.  Not a pleasant situation, so black must retake h5.} gxh5 31. Kh2 {Now white moves the king to protect the white pawn on h3.  This leaves black with several options.  One is Qf5 and another is Qf3 - both of which threaten the h3 pawn and protect the h5 pawn.  While each is tempting, black can counter either by moving Bg3 to block the rook on c3.} Rg8 {Black has an another idea.  First move rook to wide open g column, and then move queen to same column in order to mate white's king on g2.} 32. f4 {I don't think this was a good move.  It prevents white's bishop from influencing events near the white king.  I still think Bg3 was far better.} Qg6 {Black moves the queen into position for checkmate.} 33. Qe7+ {A last ditch attempt by white to distract black.  Black can just move the king out of harm's way and this leaves white's queen far away from where she offer protection to her king.} Kh6 34. Qg5+ {Now that black has the advantage, white presses for a queen exchange to prevent mate.} Qxg5 {Seeing the advantage in material black accepts the queen exchange.} 35. fxg5+ {If black took the pawn with king, then white could have put black in check and skewer the rook once the king moves out of the way.  It's far better to take this pawn out with a rook - which also limits the white king's options.} Rxg5 36. Rf6+ {Another attempt at checking the king to delay the inevitable.} Rg6 {Instead of accepting the offer of another exchange, white resigned.}
