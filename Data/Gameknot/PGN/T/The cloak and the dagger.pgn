1. Nf3 {here's a game i played against kbg0 in milatins 4th chess festival it provides a good illustration of the fact that one must be careful when moving pawns because while sometimes a pawn move might look nice on the surface they can often have serious consequences.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. d4 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Ne4 8. Qc2 Nxc3 9. Qxc3 f5 {The game begins 1.      Nf3	Nf6 2.	c4	e6 3.	d4	b6 4.	g3	Bb7 5.	Bg2	Be7 6.	O-O	O-O 7.	Nc3	Ne4 8.	Qc2	Nxc3 9.	Qxc3	f5   The Queens Indian Defence} 10. h4 {Here i leave the main opening lines mainly because i didnt like the look of the e7 bishop backed up by the queen also i now have a nice looking hold on the g5 square although i now realise that i could be exposing myself to an assault on with blacks g and h pawns. I'm a bit unsure about this move now what do u guys think? am i weakening my position through this move?} d6 11. Bf4 Nd7 12. b4 Bf6 13. Ng5 Bxg2 14. Kxg2 Re8 15. Qf3 {15 Qf3? Here is my only really significant mistake i didnt see it at the time but my d pawn is hanging. Fortunately for me black gets greedy and want to push his pawn forward with 15...e5} e5 {15...e5?? huge mistake by black as we are about to see! black want to give me the run around before snatching my pawn but i have other ideas!} 16. Qd5+ {16. Qd5 ! suddenly black is toast if he plays 16...Kf8 then Qf7 brings checkmate. Blacks only try is to play 16..Kh8 tempting white to play 17. Nf3 and taking the queen, however, as "yttrio" points out white has the threat of a smothered mate which you can see below in the comments. It was att this point that my opponent resigned. This game teaches an important lesson that every pawn your opponent makes has the potential to leave a gaping hole in their defence allowing you to slip right past their defenders. With the cloak removed you reveal the dagger!}
