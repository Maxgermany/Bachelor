[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange, Alekhine variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez.} a6 4. Bxc6 {The exchange is far less popular than Ba4, but I like it because it doubles black's pawns.} dxc6 {Alekhine Variation of the Ruy Lopez.  Castling or Nc3 are white's best responses here.  Pd3 appears to yield black an advantage.} 5. d3 Bc5 6. Qe2 Nf6 7. h3 h6 8. Nc3 Bd6 9. Be3 O-O 10. O-O b5 11. a3 c5 12. Rfe1 Rb8 13. Rad1 b4 14. axb4 cxb4 15. Nd5 c6 16. Nxf6+ Qxf6 17. Kh2 {I like d4 here.  Not sure what moving the king does.} a5 18. d4 exd4+ 19. Kg1 {Right, d3 cannot be played after kh2 for this reason.  White drops a bishop.} dxe3 20. Qxe3 Ba6 21. b3 Rbd8 22. Qb6 {Three undefended pieces are attacked by this one move.} Bb5 23. Nd4 Qe5 24. g3 Rdb8 25. Qxa5 c5 {Black withdraws support of his white bishop.  Nxb5 puts white up a pawn, while threatening Bd6.} 26. Nf3 Qc3 {Black attacks two undefended pieces, c2 and Nf3 while exposing Bd6.  It will be an exchange, leaving black 's queen better positioned to attack white's castle.} 27. Rxd6 Qxf3 28. Qa1 {I think Rb6 might be better.  White cannot afford even exchanges, but Rxb6, Qxb6 and black must move the bishop.  Or black could play Rc8, Rxb8, Rxb8 and Qc7 means black must move the rook and lose Qxc5, attacking Bb5.  } Rfe8 {Pe4 is lost, without a good counter threat.  Qa7 doesn't work as black's Re4xRe1+ ends with Qh1#.} 29. Qd1 Qxd1 30. Rexd1 Be2 31. Re1 Bf3 32. Re3 Bxe4 33. Kh2 {The white king cannot get enough of h2.} Bxc2 34. Rc6 Rxe3 35. Rxc5 {No, trading rooks was the proper response here.  Rxc5 makes up one point.  Pfxe3 is five points.  While splitting the pawns, it leaves black up only a bishop (and soon to be lost pawn) instead of a rook and bishop.  The general rule of thumb is to start with, "can I force mate?". Then "can I prevent force mate against me?". Then "can I acquire a high value piece?". Followed by the "can I prevent the loss of my high value piece?". After these four are ruled out, push a pawn.  Or if the queens are gone, move the king up, if safe.} Rxb3 {Re2 would have been better.  The pawn was not going anywhere, and black could pick it up later.} 36. Rxc2 {White takes good advantage of black's mistake.} g5 37. Kg2 Kg7 38. Rc4 f6 39. g4 Rc3 40. Re4 b3 41. Re1 b2 42. Kf1 {? The king should remain with the forward pawns.} b1=Q {Why trade queen for rook when Rc1 forces a rook trade instead?  Rc1 leaves black a queen and rook instead of two rooks.  } 43. Rxb1 Rxb1+ 44. Kg2 Kg6 45. Kh2 h5 46. gxh5+ {}
