1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 c5 4. exd5 exd5 5. Ngf3 Nf6 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. Qe2+ Be7 8. dxc5 O-O 9. Nb3 Re8 10. Be3 a6 11. Bd3 a5 12. a4 Na6 13. c6 Bxc6 14. Nfd4 Bd7 15. Bb5 Ng4 16. O-O Qc7 17. g3 Nxe3 18. Qxe3 Bf6 19. Qd3 {I was expecting 19. Qf3  Nb4 and next 20...Nc6, which parallels Karpov-Bareev, Tilburg 1994.  But 19. Qd3 let's black's queen's knight into action quickly. It seems to shift the momentum now.} Nb4 20. Qf3 Bxb5 21. Nxb5 Qxc2 22. Rac1 Qe2 23. Qf5 Rad8 24. Rfe1 Qxe1+ 25. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 26. Kg2 b6 27. h4 {27. h4  Best. If 27. Qf3, then 27...Nc2 and ...d4 and white is facing a dangerous passed pawn.} Re5 28. Qg4 Re4 29. Qf3 Nc2 30. Kh3 Nd4 {30...Nd4  This is my attempt to exchange a few pieces with the hope of pairing the rooks and the passed pawn against the queen.  It seemed to be a formidable threat, so that explains White's 32nd move.} 31. Nb3xd4 Bxd4 32. Nc7 {It is important in this position for black to watch his first rank, since the white queen can always find a way to spring loose and checkmate the black king effortlessly.  That theme develops into a significant threat shortly. } Bxb2 33. Nxd5 Re6 {The computer prefers for me to take the a-pawn 33...Rxa4, but 34. Qb3! looked too strong for me to counter all the threats.} 34. Nc7 Red6 35. Nb5 Re6 36. Qf4 Be5 37. Qg5 Bf6 38. Qf5 g6 {38....g6 gives my king a little "luft" or an escape hatch.  That is, until he starts to mount his h-pawn mini-storm.} 39. Qf4 Kg7 40. g4 {40. g4  This gives the rooks a chance to mount a very serious challenge now, as long as Black's king can avoid getting checkmated first!} Rd3+ 41. Kg2 Re2 42. h5 Be5 {42...Be5  I now had to calculate the moves precisely.  I could not afford to abandon the king's protection of the bishop, but that is precisely why the coming 43.h6+ is so effective.  And so I had to rescue the bishop first, knowing I would then have to send my King on a merry chase around the board.  Ironically, the following rain of checks against me gives me a chance to hide my king behind the bishop, just long enough to mount what will be the death blow to the white king. } 43. h6+ Kf8 44. Qc4 Rdd2 {44....Aligning the battering ram now against the white king.  Only giving up the white queen can stop it now.} 45. Qc8+ Ke7 46. Qb7+ Kf6 47. Qxb6+ Kg5 48. Qc5 Rexf2+ 49. Kg1 Rfg2+ 50. Kh1 {50.  Kh1.  Seemingly giving up, since this is now a mate in two.  White still has life after 50. Kf1, but for how long?} Rgh2+ {}
