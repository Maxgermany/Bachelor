[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {1. .......d5 - The Centre Counter Defence - black can play Qxd5 but the BQ does get chased around.} 2. e5 {2. e5 - white does not take on d5!} f6 {2. …. f6 - bit dubious here - it opens up the Fool's Mate diagonal and it does not develop a piece.  However, if white plays exf6 black can recapture with Nxf6 which is development and prevents a WQ getting to h5.} 3. d4 e6 4. Nf3 {4. Nf3 - development.} b6 5. Nc3 c5 {5. …. c5 - black has moved a lot of pawns and developed no pieces!} 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 8. dxc5 bxc5 9. exf6 Nxf6 {9. ….. Nxf6 - black's position has improved after this plethora of exchanges.  He does have a strong pawn centre.} 10. Ne5 Qc7 11. Bf4 Bd6 12. Nb5 Qa5+ 13. Nc3 d4 {13. …… d4 - it looks as though black will win a piece here.  However, another white knight comes to the rescue by forking the BQ and the BB on d6.} 14. Nc4 Qd8 15. Nxd6+ Ke7 16. Nb7 Qb6 17. Nxc5 dxc3 {17. …. dxc3 - black regains his piece but …..} 18. Na4 Qa5 19. Nxc3 {19. Nxc3 - ..... white is 2 pawns up.} Rd8 20. Qf3 Nd5 {20. …… Nd5 - only way to save rook on a8.} 21. O-O {21. 0-0 - white finally castles and unpins his knight.} Nxc3 22. Bg5+ Ke8 23. Bxd8 Qxd8 24. Qxa8 {24. Qxa8 - white has a terrific material advantage after this.  His opponent plays on a few moves however.} Ne2+ 25. Kh1 Qd6 26. Qxa7 {26. Qxa7 - another pawn falls.} Nc6 27. Qe3 Ncd4 28. Rad1 {28. Rad1 - pin.} e5 29. c3 Nf5 30. Rxd6 {30. Rxd6 - After this move black finally resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  After Nxd3, fxe3 white is an overwhelming 10 points up on material.  White brilliantly exploited the trapped rook on a8 in the middle game and caused black to lose very heavy material.  An excellent Expert Victory for ab15 in a blitz game!}
