PxQb6 would attack Pa2.  Even NxQb6 makes back the queen.  Any other move should only be considered if force mate ensues, or is prevented.  Qe6+ gives white Nd5 (taken by Bg2).} 23. Qe6+ {Exactly!} Rf7 24. Bxd5 {Yes!  Black must defend against QxRf7+.  Nd6 also gives white Rf7.} Bxd5 {Raf8 might have been better.} 25. Qxd5 Raf8 26. Qxg5 {Nd6 was probably better.} fxg3 27. Qxg3 Rf7f3 28. Qc7 h5 {White could play NxPd4.} 29. Qc4+ Kh7 {Again NxPd4.} 30. c3 {No.}
