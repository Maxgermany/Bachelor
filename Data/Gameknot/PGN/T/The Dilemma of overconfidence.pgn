1. d4 {Hello my fellow GK players. Here is my latest annotation, although this is not my best game but I'm interested to annotate this as a part of lesson in chess. I almost lost on this position but at the end I managed to win because of white careless and overconfidence. Please free to feed any of your criticism and feeback. My opponent open d4 I replied usually against d4 opening by Nf6.} Nf6 2. c4 {c4 is the usual reply it continue to put pawn influence in center and development of white's queen in c2 b3 and a4.} d5 {I replied d5. I want to try Queen's Gambit than my usual opening Gruenfeld or later King's Indian Defense.} 3. cxd5 Qxd5 {I take pawn by queen. In my opinion c6 is much better and I can easily equalize. But my move Qxd5 white already have an upperhand on this position.} 4. Nc3 {The normal move for white to kick my queen.} Qa5 {My Queen's maneuever was similar to normal move in scandinavian. The differenence white's e pawn is still in e2} 5. Nf3 {In my opinion Bd2 is much more stronger than this move. Since it put pressure on my queen} Nc6 {Before making this move I preferred move c6 but after 5 e4 Bg4 6.h3 Bxf3 7.Qxf3 Nbd7 8. 0-0-0 Qxd4 9. Be3 white have a huge advantage.} 6. Bd2 Bg4 {To prepare for my king's safety and to capture d pawn} 7. e4 Bxf3 8. gxf3 Qb6 {Later I found this move was a mistake the correct move is Qh5 to prevent White's king bishop in h3 (it would prevent my long castling) I make this move to target d pawn and poison b pawn.} 9. d5 Ne5 10. f4 Ng6 {Passive move, 10...Neg4 are much ok} 11. e5 {Instead of this move white much stronger move is Qa4+} Nd7 {The only logical move} 12. Qc2 e6 {To free my bishop } 13. O-O-O O-O-O {Before castling I consider to move my bishop to b4,since white have a big advantage I want to exchange the pieces and shifting from middle game to endgame.} 14. Kb1 {a very good move, white can shift his rook to c1 and as well white kings safety} Qxf2 {a greedy move!! Nc5 or Bb4 are ok than this risky move} 15. Ne4 Qb6 16. Ng5 {With this move I lost in exchange and almost a lost position!!} exd5 {Only the available good move left on me!!} 17. Nxf7 {The life of my two rooks now at the mercy of white's knight!!} Bb4 {at last for so long I develop my bishop..} 18. Bxb4 Qxb4 19. Rxd5 {19. Bh3 is very good move unlike this Rxd5. After 19 Bh3 if 19..Nxf4 20. Bxd7+ Rxd7 21. Nxh8 white wins a piece. If 20..Kxd7 21. Qf5+} Nxf4 20. Rd2 {Rd1 is better than Rd2} Nxe5 21. Nxd8 {At last white captured one of my miserable rook..} Rxd8 22. Bh3+ Nxh3 {A usual move } 23. Qf5+ Nd7 {The logical move. } 24. Rxd7 {I was very surprised with this unexpected move!! after this move, the situation is opposite, black have an overwhelming position} Rxd7 {after this move white decided to resign. I won against a much higher rated and I didn't expected to win even to draw on my hopeless position. The lesson I've got from this game don't underestimate the position (or your opponent) not because you are in winning position you already won the game. }
