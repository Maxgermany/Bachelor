1. e4 c5 {This is a move I don't like. I'm not very familiar with the Sicilian and I often find myself in a tough spot when opponents use it... (It is intentional to say it out loud in this annotation... I want people to use it against me so I'll practice it and since then I got to play the Sicilian quite a few times)} 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Bb5 e5 5. d3 a6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 {I really don't know if those moves are what is normally recommended, though I think I made pretty good responses to black moves. He now has double pawns on the C file and the bishop vs knight exchange in this game seems to be at my advantage...} 7. Nxe5 {and of course they allow me to take his E pawn!} Qd4 8. Nf3 {Placing the piece on a secure space and driving his queen back} Qd8 9. Bg5 {pinning his knight... eventually preparing e4} Be7 {wisely breaking the pin} 10. h3 {At this point I decided I would be better to castle queen side and take advantage of the fact he will most likely castle on the king side to launch an attack with my pawns... I also wanted to avoid the pin by Bg4} O-O {I was really happy to see him do this} 11. e5 {Opening up the center.} Nd5 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 13. Ne4 {And now my two knights have an eye on his king side} Nf4 {Threatening Nxg2 but I was already planning to place my rook in g1!} 14. Rg1 Bf5 {He wants to force the exchanges, which is good, but now I can place my knight on a really powerful space...} 15. Nd6 {Nd6! That knight can't be removed so easily, and will prove to be important for the final attack} Bg6 16. Qd2 {Preparing 17. O-O-O and attacking his knight...} Nd5 17. O-O-O Qc7 {Qc7? He now wants to build an attack on my queen side with moves like Nb4 and Qa5, but there is no real potential in that plan.} 18. g4 {Launching my own attack. Pawn storm!} Nb4 {Setting up Qa5 or Nxa2 ...} 19. a3 {but a simple pawn move counters his plan. Na2  is refuted by Kb1 and the knight is lost.} Nd5 {He is back where he started.} 20. h4 {Pressing forward} h5 {I think h6 was a better move, opening a secure space for his bishop and defending g5, which my queen and knight can now freely use.} 21. gxh5 Bxh5 22. Qg5 {Threatening  Qxg7  ...} g6 {Forced...} 23. Qh6 {Qh6!! I am now planing Ng5. If he takes the undefended knight...} Bxf3 24. Nf5 {my other knight comes right in!} Qxe5 {f6 would have been better. However, it leads to 25. Rxg6  Kf7 26. Rg7  grabbing his queen after the king moves.} 25. Rxg6+ {Sacrificing the rook to open completely the black King. Checkmate is now possible in 6 moves.} fxg6 26. Qxg6+ Kh8 27. Qh6+ {And he resigns. The game is over after 27 ... Kg8 28. Rg1  Bg2 29. Rxg2  Qg3 30. Rxg3  Kf7 and 31. Qg6  . In this game, I have been able to take advantage of the space my opponent gave me to launch a powerful attack on his king. The key to this attack was my powerful knight in d6, which ultimately led to his demise. So, hope you liked it. Feedback would be appreciated!}
