1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Qb6 {called the "Grivas" sicilian in the name of Greek GM Grivas who used to play it a lot. All this suite is theoric till the 15th move ..} 5. Nb3 Nf6 6.

Nxc3 {this move is right too.  all the following moves are analyzed with fritz 8  } a4 {best move for fritz} 17. Nb5 {fritz proposes Nc1} Qd7 {fritz proposes Qb8 and gives "=" for the position} 18. Nb3d4 {best move for fritz} Nxd4 {best move for fritz} 19. Nxd4 {best move for fritz white knight found a good position, and at this time i thought that black position was a little under. that is not true, as fritz propose now Ba6 with a draw position. } Bb7 {this thematic move is also playable, and this is the second best move for fritz} 20. Qh3 {best move for fritz} g6 {bad move !!! deteriorating the pawn structure, giving access to black squares,  fritz gives  = for white ( 0.78) with f4-f5 following for white   Ba6 was much better} 21. f5 {best move for fritz} exf5 {2nd best move for fritz that recommands e5 black stay with a bad evaluation (-1.00)} 22. exf5 {best move for fritz} Bd5 {a difficult move to find, but the best for fritz ! it protects e6, to avoid Ke6} 23. Bb5 {best move for fritz a good move that maintain the pressure. } Qb7 {best move for fritz keep a pressure on g2.  } 24. Bg5 {fritz proposed Bh6 with  1.16.  here the position is nearly draw now black have not a lot of moves, but Ke4 is to be studied with attention} Ne4 {best move for fritz it was a little breath for black At now, i can say that white have done a good work, except their last move, and fritz evaluates the position with an advance of half a pawn for white.  black have well played also, except g6, that was a big mistake.} 25. Bh6 {fritz proposed Bxe7 ( 0.47)  white move is drawing  } Rfd8 {fritz was recommanding Bf6  now he gives the following suite for white  1. ï¿½ (0.78): 25.

Nf5 {i was waiting for this move ! for the first time, the evaluation is better for black, (-0.91), despite the white supremacy ! fritz gives Bf6, i saw it but the position was really too complex} Ne6 {a simple move, but totally wrong ! fritz gives Ba6, with  1,75 for white , and my opponent and me did not see it. difficult to find it in a such complicated position} 30. Nxe7+ Qxe7 31. Rf5 {at this time i saw a very good move for black. fritz gives  1.75 for black in this suite ! i was lucky} Nf4 {incredible ! Queen e7 is not takeable, (Rc1 mates). g2 and Re1 are attacked, there is no defense that doesn't loose material} 32. Rxf4 Qxe1+ 33. Rf1 Qe4 {a big blunder but the match was so difficult !} 34. Qxe4 Bxe4 35. Bxa4 Rca8 {i proposed draw, and my Russian opponent accepted. the same day, Russia was eliminated from european football cup against spain 3-0. anyway it was a great  team !! thanks to my opponent, krotenok, and nice to meat you !  a very tactical match, with a lot of opportunities.}
