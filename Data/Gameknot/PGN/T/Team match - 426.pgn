[Opening "French (C12), MacCutcheon, Janowski variation"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. Be3 {This and 8. a3 are the bulwarks of the Janowski system designed to defeat the MacCutcheon.  It has been sufficient to keep the MacCutcheon in relative obscurity since the early 1900's.  And it is likely the most dangerous  for Black.  But I thought there is still some room for innovation, and a way to get a lot of action for Black.  This game shows one way to do it.} Ne4 7. Qg4 {Of course! White must put the question to g7 if he wants Black to make any concessions.} Kf8 {Definitely not 7...Nxc3? 8.Qxg7 Rf8 9. Bd2 Nxa2 10. c3!} 8. a3 Ba5 {There is virtually nothing in the literature about this move, and usually 8...Bxc3+ is played.  But I wanted to keep the Bishop in action, especially if I could get in ...c5 and Nc6, with a strong center push (which is the strength of the French Defense if White allows it).} 9. Nge2 c5 10. O-O-O Nxc3 11. Nxc3 Nc6 12. Nb5 cxd4 13. Bxd4 Qg5+ {This is now permitted due to 13. Bxd4.  Is the Queen trade smart?  We'll see.} 14. Qxg5 hxg5 15. g4 {I was expecting 15. Nd6, and Ke7 looks OK for me, with a shot at the e-pawn.} Nxd4 {Naturally!  This removes the very heart of White's strategy in the Janowski, the Queen Bishop.  It also keeps Black's 2 Bishops.  The downside is that it sacrifices some play against the advanced e-pawn. One strength in Black's system is that Black's g-pawn stops White's supporting f4.   I could have kept all bishops in play by 15...a6 16. Bc5+ Kg8 17. Nd6 looks strong for White.} 16. Nxd4 Bb6 17. Nb5 Bd7 {Do I really care now that White's Knight occupies such an advanced cost in my position?  Not really, as long as my 2 Bishops keep active so that I can ignore it !} 18. Nd6 Bc6 {Both defense and the threat of a few nasty surprises for the Rook on h1 now loom.  No reason to play ...Bxf2 yet, and I think it is more important to avoid opening the f-file to White's Rook on h1.} 19. f3 Be3+ 20. Kb1 Bf4 {Starting to tie up White's pieces on defense now.  My 2 Bishops are going to rage across the board if I can help it!} 21. Re1 Rxh2 22. Bd3 Ke7 {The computer analysis dislikes this move and recommends instead 22...Rxh1  23. Rxh1 Ke7  24. Nb5 Bxe5 25. c3 Bd7 26. Nd4 Rc8  27. Rh7 Rc5 28. Ka2 Kf6 29. Nb3 Rc6 30. Nd4 Rc8 31. Be2 Bb8 with a stronger advantage for Black.} 23. Rxh2 Bxh2 24. b4 a6 {Lots of tricks here. I saw no time for 24...Bxe5 due to 25. Nf5+ Kf6  26. Nxg7!  So 24..a6 looks best, since 25. b5  ab  26. Nxb5 Bxb5 27. Bxb5 Rxa3 nets at least one pawn and maybe two.} 25. c4 Bg3 26. Re2 dxc4 27. Nxc4 Rd8 {The parameters are now set for the balance of the game.  I have just one pawn net, but the 2 Bishops will net more eventually, including the f-pawn and maybe the e-pawn.  Then I may have a shot at the White King.  Keep in mind that with Queens gone, a checkmate is much harder to force.  A lot of work here still to do! } 28. Bc2 Bf4 29. Kb2 Bxf3 30. Rf2 {The Rook has very few options now, as long as he stays on the second rank.  He will eventually spring that Rook, but at a cost to the safety of his King.} Bd5 31. Bb3 b5 32. Nb6 Bxe5+ 33. Ka2 Bxb3+ 34. Kxb3 Bd4 {Of course.  A multiple Bishop skewer is a pleasure to watch (unless you are on the receiving end!)} 35. Rc2 Bxb6 36. Rc6 Rd6 37. Rc2 Rd3+ {The first move that puts his King into the coffin corner.  38. Rc3 Rxc3+ leaves plenty of time to advance Black's pawns, and the Bishop will keep the lid on his King} 38. Ka2 Kd6 39. Rh2 {Not 39. Rc8? Rd2+ and 40. Kb3?  Bd4 stops the Rook skewer from d8 and also puts the nails in White's King's coffin.} Bd4 40. Rh8 Rd2+ 41. Kb1 Kd5 42. Ra8 Kc4 {White can help himself to all the Pawns he wants.  I am after  bigger game now!} 43. Rxa6 Kb3 44. Kc1 Be3 45. Ra5 Rd3+ 46. Kb1 Rd1# {}
