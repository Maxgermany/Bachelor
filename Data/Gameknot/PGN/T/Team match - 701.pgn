1. e4 {Good day , Flamerider. I just wanted to point out some tactical losses in this game for you. Some may be more or less obvious but you can see for yourself what you had missed.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d6 4. Ng5 {?} Qxg5 5. O-O Bh3 {the plan would've worked with 5...Nd4 , if 6.c3 or other attempts to dive knight away, then with 6...Bh3! making it impossible for queen to move on f3(or leave the square at all.)} 6. Qf3 Nf6 {6...Be6 saving the bishop} 7. Qxh3 Qg4 {7...Qg4?  - not a good time for exchanging pieces. free pawn on e4.} 8. Qxg4 Nxg4 9. h3 Nf6 10. Nc3 Be7 11. Bd5 Nd4 {Nice attacking move! Giving more sacrificing b pawn in order to gain c pawn   free open file for your rook and tempo!} 12. Bxb7 Rb8 13. Bd5 Nxc2 {Before taking this pawn, better move was to prevent biship moving to Bc6  messing up your castling; instead try following line 13...Nxd5 14.Nxd5 14...Nxc2 and white knight cannot now take c7 since it would get into double attack.} 14. Rb1 {(14.Bc6!)} O-O {Still taking the bishop would be great since f6 knight cant do much anyway, it would also support your F pawn advance plan in the future nevertheless  castling is pretty good as well. } 15. Bb3 Nd4 16. Ba4 Nh5 17. d3 f5 {Nice plan.} 18. Nd5 Bd8 19. Bd1 Nf6 20. Be3 {I'd prefer 21...Nb5 22.a4 22...Nc3!} Nxd5 {good exchange.} 21. exd5 f4 22. Bxd4 exd4 23. b3 {try avoid these kind of moves until its absolutely necessary.true that it frees a rook , however it frees the enemy rook as well.} Bg5 {Hard to find any kind of plan here.you have only two rooks and a bishop. Kingside advance would likely to lead nowhere.its time to find your 7th rank position. best way to do that is through c file is to drible threatning the weak pawn in d5 by 23...Rb5 24.Bc3 24...Rc5 if white tries to trade, then Rc3! and you have a black bishop to back up and queenside is yours. this is the true advantage of bishop of different colour when there is no such bishop with your enemy or knights. E file is not the right path since white bishop is guarding.} 24. Bg4 g6 25. Rbe1 {(Rc1! -25...f3 is no threat, doesnt really matter if one loses g pawn in the endgame)} Rb5 26. Be6+ Kg7 27. g3 {ignore this threat, no need to waste precious tempo. find something else, for example a5 or Rc5} fxg3 28. fxg3 Be3+ 29. Kg2 {Fearing that he intrudes your 7th rank? try Rc5 and you have nothing to lose when he gets to your f7 square with one rook and bishop while you have c2 and check with three pawns ready to get stabbed.} Rbb8 30. Rxf8 Rxf8 31. a4 Rf2+ 32. Kh1 Rb2 33. Rf1 Rxb3 34. Rf7+ Kh6 35. Rxc7 Rxd3 36. Rxa7 Bf2 {promoting  d pawn is now your primary objective.36..Rd1!} 37. Kg2 Bxg3 38. Bg8 Kg5 {the same applies with white.} 39. Bxh7 {Better is Bf4 or Be5} Kh4 40. Bxg6 Rd2+ {40..Re3! prevents knight attack.} 41. Kf3 Rf2+ 42. Ke4 Rf4+ 43. Kd3 Kxh3 44. a5 Rf3+ 45. Kxd4 Bf2+ 46. Ke4 Rf6 47. Bf5+ {This was your last chance . 47..Rxf5!!} Kh4 48. Rh7+ Kg5 49. Rg7+ Kh4 50. Rg2 Bg3 51. a6 Rf8 52. Bd7 Ra8 53. Ra2 Ra7 54. Kd4 Be5+ 55. Kc4 Kg5 56. Kb5 Kf6 57. Bc6 Bd4 58. Re2 Bc5 59. Re8 Re7 60. Rxe7 Kxe7 61. Ba8 Kd7 62. Bc6+ {Nice game, no serious blunders from your behalf. Hope it helped a bit.}
