[Opening "King's gambit (C30)"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Here playing white on a king gambit game. It's a very quick blitz game. The opening look unsound but still very reliable.} Nc6 {Declined. I found d6 better if you want to decline it. } 3. Nf3 {Developping and prevent Qh4. 3.fxe5 Nxe5 4.d4 look winner, but black could answer with Qh4 followed by Qxe4.} f6 {? d6 or exf4 is better. Black is breaking his protection and lose tempo.} 4. Bc4 {To castle the most quickly as possible + threatening his knight and Bf7.} d6 {Well he should have done it sooner. He's late on development now.} 5. O-O {Moved quickly, but I think Bxg8 would have been better, messing up his castling on king side.} Nge7 {Well he should have developped his pieces on queen side instead to castle quickly. Or maybe do Na5, the bishop is too much strong right now.} 6. fxe5 fxe5 {? he should have done dxe5 here or Na5. Now with this open line I can do Bf7+.} 7. d4 {Ng5 could have been fine but there was no hurry. Not enought pieces developped to have a very strong combination.} Bg4 {! well it was logic, but I don't think it change really something because 8.Bf7+ Kxf7 9.Ng5+ Ke8 10.Qxg4. and white keep the advantage.} 8. dxe5 {?! Probably not the best move here, but I thought there was still no hurry.} Nxe5 {It look a fine move, threatening both my bishop and my knight.} 9. Nxe5 {!!} dxe5 {There was no escape at this point!} 10. Bf7# {Mate. Really enjoyed this 2-3 mins blitz game.}
