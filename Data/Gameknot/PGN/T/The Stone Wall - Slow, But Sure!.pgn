1. d4 e6 2. e3 Nf6 3. Bd3 d5 4. Nd2 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. f4 c4 7. Bc2 Bd6 8. Ngf3 O-O {Here, the position of the Stone Wall Project has been reached, only this time Black has his bishop on d6 rather than e7. } 9. O-O {I think it's best not to do this straight away. [from what my experience has taught me] Instead, Ne5 and h3 should be played in order to prevent the strong Ng4... } Nd7 {Though Black seems to have a completely different idea for that knight! I remember playing this myself to prepare to capture on e5 should White move his knife there and/or to drive it away with f6, so I don't think it's that bad of a move (though Ng4 would probably be stronger) } 10. Ne5 {White wastes no time reaching the e5 outpost } Ne7 {Black was probably worried about Nxc6, which doubles up pawns on the c-file. Of course, White wouldn't have done that straight away (the outpost is too good) but Black may have plans of chasing the knight away [interestingly enough, Black can do the same with Nxe5, but the semi-open f-file can prove to be sufficient compensation] } 11. Qf3 {Staying true to the sample game on the Knights of Honour forum -  White's plan is g4, then g5, then Bxh7!!, which leads to an overwhelming kingside attack! I was hoping that my opponent would be inexperienced enough to fall into this attack. } Qe8 {Not sure what the purpose of this move is supposed to be... } 12. g4 {#1.... } f6 {ahhh.... never mind about my attack then - the knight is an important weapon in the attack that I was planning } 13. Nxd7 {White has to exchange, but I don't mind too much right now.... } Bxd7 {...because I still have a good kingside attack going! } 14. Qh3 {?! Is this the best move? turns out it works to  my advantage in this case, but that's only because Black missed out on two better moves to protect h7 (g6, and Ng6) perhaps h4, or the more cautious Qg3 (preventing any nasty tricks) would have sufficed... } f5 {? Allows White to solidify his pawn chain kingside, though it does seem like a neat way to block the bishop's diagonal. White takes advantage of this straight away... } 15. g5 {Black will have quite a job weakening White's pawn chain! } Ng6 {?! Black, realising that his kingside is going to need support, brings his knight over to defend... but again, I'm unsure about this move - in fact, when I first saw this move I only saw it as a way to give White a free tempo - I plan to start advancing my h-pawn soon } 16. Qg3 {Of course, the queen does need to make way for the pawn... } Be7 {? Yet another move which I just don't like - it achieves absolutely nothing, for starters! All this did was make the g6 knight even more of a tasty (tempo) target } 17. h4 {White plans to play h5 next move, and Black ought to see that too - the only square that he will have is the h8 square, which just looks ugly! There are two alternatives to that move; 1) 17...Rf7 18.h5 Nf8, where Black will have quite a job unravelling his pieces! 2)Moving the dark square bishop so that Ne7 can be played. This - might - have been best, but it would mean admitting his last move was a mistake. } Nh8 {Black takes the aforementioned third option, but like I said, what a horrible place for the knight! A knight on the rim is dim... what about a knight on a corner? } 18. Kf2 {Making way for a rook push to h1, so that I can support the h4 pawn } Qh5 {? As much as I hate to keep calling my opponent's move poor, this is just another move that just isn't helping Black at all... perhaps this game has taken him right out of his comfort zone for such moves like this to be played. This gives White a free tempo - pure and simple! } 19. Bd1 {! In addition, White can use the free tempo to advance his pawn even further! } Qf7 {Black is understandably hesitant about retreating the queen to the original square (he might as well achieve SOMETHING!) but now where can the h8 knight go? } 20. h5 g6 {Just about forced, or else 21.g6! could become a real threat! [I don't think it was possible to play it straight away, but once White starts getting pressure down the h-file, this move would have to have been played anyway] } 21. Rh1 {White has no intention whatsoever of either locking down the position or exchanging pawns, both of which withers down White's attack. With that in mind, this is the best move to prevent the pawn-winning gxh5, and fortunately it is also consistent with White's plans down the h-file. First things first; White needs to get his other rook into play } Qe8 {A waste of a move? Well, not really - Black sees what White is trying to do and is preparing his own defence to the coming storm. In fact, that theme is consistent in the following moves - White preparing to storm the castle while Black rallies all his troops to defend. } 22. b4 {played to open up a path for the dark-square bishop - I honestly couldn't care less whether Black captures en passant or not... } cxb3 e.p. {He captures en passant... but there was another possibility in the position, a move which had been played against me in a game vs Freddy - 22...a4!? It would be more aggressive (and better too, in my opinion) but the difference between this game and my game with Freddy is the position of my dark-square bishop - I would counter a4 with Ba3, consistent in my plan to free the a1 rook } 23. axb3 {! There were three recaptures to choose from, and I believe this one to be best, keeping the white pawns connected in one long pawn island. The knight capture takes it away from the action that will be happening kingside. The bishop capture sets a trap, though it does look like a mistake; 23.Bxb3 gxh5? 24.Bd1! and White regains his pawn with a scary h-file to operate on. However, Black could instead play 23...Ba4! I don't want to give Black any kind of attacking chances like that } a6 {Is Black finally thinking about starting an attack of his own? } 24. Bb2 {White gets one of his bishops out of the way... } Rf7 {...and Black reveals the purpose of his Qe8 - he realises that the h7 pawn will eventually need support, so he defends it now } 25. Be2 {and now my rooks are connected! My attack isn't too far away! } Bc6 {?! I do not understand the rationale behind this move... } 26. Rh4 {White has plans of setting up Alekhine's gun along the h-file! When the time is right for White, hxg6 could prove deadly! } Rg7 {At first, I thought that this move was played to aid in defence of h7, which would be a potential White target (as I'll explain later... when White does play hxg6, Black will not be able to retake with the pawn) } 27. Rah1 {White's other rook comes into play! } Kf7 {Still clueless about what Black intends here, though I'll find out next move... and I make the mistake in thinking White still have plenty of time... (after all, Black doesn't seem to have any plans of his own) } 28. Rh1h3 {!? Studying the position, I figured that RRQ was going to be a lot more powerful than RQR, so I invest an extra move into making that happen } Qf8 {Only now do I realise what Black plans, and it seems so obvious too! With the action going on kingside, Black's king is hauling his butt to the other side of the board! I don't really want that to happen... } 29. hxg6+ {It's now or never - time to attack! } Nxg6 {Any other recapture leads to disaster for Black, meaning that the knight in the 'horribly placed' corner actually proved useful! The worst thing Black can do is 29...Kxg6?? 30.Bh5#. Also inferior is 29...hxg6?, and simply 30.Rxh8! wins the exchange. 29...Rxg6? 30.Rxh7+ Rg7 [else the queen is lost] 31.Rxh8 works out similary, albeit with an extra pawn with the exchange. } 30. Rh4xh7 {Now, with all the preparation that White has been undergoing to attack kingside, he walks away with.... a pawn. Is a pawn really all that White was able to gain? well... we'll see ;) } Rxh7 {?! Black chooses to exchange - evidently an attempt to release the pressure on his position. However, this may have just ramped up the pressure for Black! Ke8 may have been better in the position } 31. Rxh7+ {The king only has two places to go... } Kg8 {and in this case, Black chooses correctly, though it keeps the king in dangerous waters for now. If 31...Ke8?, 32.Bh5! would win the knight, as it's White's two attackers (the rook and bishop) vs Black's defender (the queen - no other piece can assist in time) and of course, the knight is pinned } 32. Rh6 {As it were, White chooses to pressure the knight instead } Qg7 {defending.... } 33. Bh5 {attacking once again... } Nh8 {!? The Black knight retreats to the sanctuary of the h8 square. Another option would have been 33...Be8, which defends the knight with another piece, but I suspect that Black still wanted to get his king away from the danger area (possibly why Nf8 was rejected, too) } 34. Qh3 {the queen and rook could become a force to be reckoned with on the h-file. I guess I could have simply taken the e6 pawn too - that was an oversight on my part. However, my mind was still in full attacking mode at this point, and I was still looking for ways to mate the king [perhaps this isn't the best mindset to have...] For this attacking reason, I also rejected Nf3 (heading to e5) because I saw that Be8 forced off the bishops, and I didn't like that... I dunno why, it just didn't look right for me.... both Rxe6 and Nf3 would have been good moves, however, and perhaps they were better than Qh3, but then again this move led to a pretty continuation (albeit with a blunder from my opponent) } Kf8 {His Majesty still entertains ideas of escape... } 35. Be8 {! Setting a neat little trap for Black. All three pieces can now take White's bishop, but no capture is advised - not only does White get the material back straight away, he also ends up gaining material! } Bxe8 {?? oops! I believe for now, 35...Kg8! would have been the best option for Black, and if I decided to retreat the Bishop (Bh5) then he could play Kf8 once again. I could also play Bxc6, though I wasn't sure if I wanted Black to have a semi-open b-file... the other two captures also leads to disaster. 35...Rxe8?? 36.Rxh8+!! and Qxh8 is forced or mate follows after 36....Kf7 37.Qh5+ Qg6 38.Rh7+ Kf8 39.Qxg6. If 35...Kxe8? 36.Rxh8+ Bf8 37.Ba3! [almost forgotten about that lil' guy! :P The king can't move to the second rank to allow the rook defence because the queen is lost after Rh7. } 36. Rxh8+ {Now, the bishop capture... } Qg8 {...loses the queen! 36...Kf7 37.Rg7 isn't much better } 37. Rxg8+ Kxg8 {now White, who is the equivalent of a rook off, should have no problems converting the advantage into a win } 38. c4 {Can I do it quickly though? 38...dxc4?? 39.d5! is crushing! } Bf8 {Black doesn't fall for it, though White can leave the trap set. Still, Rc8 would have been better here [allowing White the chance to slip up; 38...Rc8 39.cxd5? Rc2! - the one thing that White needs to be wary of right now] } 39. Nf3 {White's knight is headed for the outpost on e5... } Bg7 40. cxd5 {[first, though, a pawn trade - not only because I'm ahead in material, but also because should Black want to get rid of the knight on e5, he has to deal with a second passed pawn]  } exd5 41. Ne5 b5 42. Qxf5 {Another pawn earned, and now it's only a matter of time before White wins this game... I am releasing this annotation early because my opponent takes a long time between each of his moves, but unless I make a catastrophic mistake, the end result should be obvious [this is not because my opponent is stalling, by the way - he's just a slow player] In short, a great example of what the Stone Wall can do... however, it is not always this successful. In two other seperate games, my opponents played different responses to the stone wall, while I blindly played the mini-tournament's set rules. I got crushed both times, so I need to recognise when not to continue a stone wall position... still, an entertaining game [I guess technically it still is an entertaining game... ;)] }
