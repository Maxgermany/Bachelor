1. e4 {Hi everyone1  Here is another pile of dung against Master Freddy.  Well, actually, I did try to attack but I simply wasn't quick enough but compared to some of my performances against Freddy this one is dross!  We start with the action on Move 9.} c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 Qe8 {9. ....... Qe8 - Freddy chooses to move his queen to e8.} 10. Ne6+ {10. Ne6+ - trying to establish a bind on e6.} Kb6 11. Na3 a6 12. d3 {12. d3 - opening up the c1-h6 diagonal.} Ka7 {12. ....... Ka7 - Freddy's king finds a foxhole.  How to dig him out?  I will try Be3.} 13. Be3 b6 14. Nc7 {14. Nc7 - fork.} Qg6 15. Bh3 {15. Bh3 - I try to keep Fou Leblanc on the long diagonal.} exd3 16. O-O-O {16.  0-0-0 - I do all I can to get my pieces poised for attack and now the Wicked Witch puts the question to my knight on c7.} Qc6 17. Nxa8 {17. Nxa8 - I try to close the gap material wise.} dxc2 18. Rd8 {18. Rd8 - trying to tighten the screw.} Kxa8 19. Nxc2 {19. Nxc2?? - Freddy said that I should have played Rc8 here.} g6 20. Rc8 {20.
