1. e4 d5 {Scandinavien. For an equal game enough, takes away whites' openingplans. I was the lower rated, so I wanted preventing the combinations, what I donot knew.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bc4 a6 6. Ng5 {White plays very activ for my f7 square, what the weakest pawn is.} e6 7. d3 b5 8. Bb3 Bb7 {I move my pieces with tempos.} 9. Be3 Nbd7 {Playing for c5.} 10. Nge4 Nxe4 11. Nxe4 Bxe4 12. dxe4 c5 {Two active pieces was exchanged for my passivs, and I pushed c5 with tempo.} 13. a3 c4 {The white bishop is out of game. Theoretically I have a piece more.} 14. Ba2 Nf6 15. f3 Qc7 {To play Rd8 and open the diagonal for my bishop.} 16. O-O Bc5 {I change my pieces where I can, because the position is closed, so my knight must be better then whites' bishop - what now out on game stands.} 17. Bxc5 Qxc5+ 18. Kh1 Rd8 {With tempo. And I have the open file.} 19. Qe2 O-O 20. h3 Rd7 21. Rad1 Rfd8 22. Rxd7 Rxd7 23. Rd1 Qc7 {I donot wanted to give up the open file for an exchange.} 24. Rxd7 Qxd7 25. e5 Nh5 26. Kh2 Nf4 27. Qe4 Nd5 28. c3 Nb6 {I must care of Qa8 .} 29. Bb1 g6 30. h4 Qc7 {Better would be Qd2 with winning the b2-pawn. I wanted to play against the King and so I didnot saw this.} 31. h5 f5 32. Qf4 Nd5 33. Qg3 Qg7 34. hxg6 hxg6 35. Kg1 Qh6 36. Bc2 Kf7 37. Qh2 Qc1+ {And so I won the Queen down and the game, too.} 38. Kf2 Qd2+ 39. Kg3 Qf4+ 40. Kh3 Qh6+ 41. Kg3 f4+ 42. Kg4 Qxh2 {White gaves up. Nice, isnot it? Sorry. This can be a mistake, too. Ne3 is checkmate as 42th move.}
