[Opening "Pirc defence (B07)"]

1. e4 {The most popular move.} d6 {Pirc defense, a now seldom used opening.} 2. d4 {Controlling and occupying the centre.} f5 {g6 is most popular, this is a very unusual move.} 3. f3 {Protects.} Nf6 {Putting pressure on the e4 pawn.} 4. Nc3 {Developing.} Nc6 {Likewise.} 5. Nge2 {d5 is better, but this develops the knight, and it doesn't look like the knights going anywhere, so for now, it's all good for white.} e5 {This is the tarrasch defense on the wrong side, and with white in a very different position.} 6. dxe5 {Wanting to get the knight out of position after dxe5 7. Qxd8+ Nxd8.} dxe5 {Another possibility is Nxe5.} 7. Qxd8+ {Now the knight or the king must be taken out of place.} Nxd8 {The knight volunteers and is now out of position.} 8. Bg5 {Not a pin now, as the queen is gone.} Be7 {Not wanting doubled pawns.} 9. exf5 {Finally, the pawn is swapped.} Bxf5 {The bishop is now developed.} 10. O-O-O {Castles queenside? Could be dangerous with the bishop where it is.} Ne6 {Threatening the Bishop on g5.} 11. Bxf6 {Swap.} gxf6 {Black is in a nice position, with all of their pieces developed.} 12. g3 {Wanting to develop the bishop queenside.} Nc5 {Wanting to castle queenside, and with nothing else to do the knight attempts to block the path of the rook on d1.} 13. f4 {Wanting a swap.} Be6 {Just in case the bishop is needed on a2.} 14. fxe5 {Swap.} fxe5 {Now the bishop can check the king: Bg5+} 15. Bg2 {Threatening the pawn on b7.} c6 {Blocked.} 16. Kb1 {Awww. Now what to do? …} Bg4 {…Pin the knight, maybe.} 17. Rhe1 {The knight doesn't need extra protection, but it is received anyway.} O-O {Seeing, possibly, Rf2.} 18. Rd2 {Even MORE protection? Buggar.} Rf2 {Now the knight is pinned again. Heheheh…} 19. Bf1 {Grrr. This knight is looking extremely important.} Bg5 {Threatening the rook who has no where to go but d1.} 20. Rdd1 {The only safe square.} Rxh2 {Oo! Free pawn! Yay!} 21. Ka1 {If the rook can move to b1, then the knight will be free.} Rf2 {Seeing what white was planning, black saw Rd8.} 22. Rdb1 {The knight is free! White doesn't see it, but: Rd8 Ng1 Bd2 wins rook.} Rd8 {The plan may work.} 23. Rbd1 {Awww, what? He DID see it?} Bd2 {Muhahahahahaha!!! Wins the rook anyway. } 24. Nb1 {One might see a free rook on e1, but another might see that after Be1 white can play Rxd8+, but, to yet another, one might see: Bxe1 Rxd8+ Kg7, and now the bishop on f1 is stuck and doomed. The last one is correct. } Bxe1 {As the bishop takes the rook, the truth dawns on white, but he won't give up!} 25. Rxd8+ {…} Kg7 {…Or, maybe he will. Anyway, white resigns here. Thank you for reading my annotated game!}
