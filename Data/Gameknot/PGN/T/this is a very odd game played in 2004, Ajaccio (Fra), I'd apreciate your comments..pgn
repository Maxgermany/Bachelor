1. b4 {Polish opening (did Mr. Topalov want to show off? ;-))} d5 {(not Nf6 or e5 ?) I wonder if computers would understand this game, lol.} 2. a4 {(not Nf3 or c3?). the whole game will go mad ;-)} c5 {why not open the center (e5 or Nf6..). so far one would think this is an amateur game.} 3. f4 {and an other odd move. not bXc5 or b5?} b5 {here I think black could have played cxb4 or e6.} 4. e4 {now kamikaze series will begin...} dxe4 5. d4 Nf6 {Not Qxd4! or cxb4.} 6. Nf3 {hops, which human (or computer)  on earth would play Nf3 ;-) Why not Bxb5?} e6 7. Nc3 g6 8. d5 Bg7 9. Nd2 {this night runs from one lions mouth in an other, as you'll see. By the way why not Ne5 then or Bxc5+} O-O {so far the first easy to understand & logical  move (for us).} 10. Be2 Re8 11. O-O Nfd7 12. Nc4 {as I told you, this is the frustrated (Nf3) kamikaze horse ;-)} Ne5 {lol} 13. Ne3 f5 {black wants the a1 rook?} 14. Nxf5 {auch} exf5 15. Kh1 {can you explain this move (Kh1)? I'd have moved fxe5.} Qf6 16. Bh5 {??} Nf7 17. Nxb5 Re7 18. Ra3 a6 19. h3 {not d6? What is Topalov's plan? Bh5, Nb5,b4(..a3) all hanging.} Nh6 {what is then black's plan? why not axb5? This is why these over 2500 rating guys are so special, they see things(ghosts ,lol) we don't.} 20. Rb3 Ng4 {all these mad knights ;-) } 21. Bd2 Re8 22. Qb1 Nh2 {??} 23. Kxh2 gxh5 24. Kh1 a5 25. bxa5 Qe7 26. a6 h4 27. Kh2 {I think black looks somewhat stronger here but they agreed for draw after next move.} Bxa6 {an unusual game, don't you think? why draw though? If I were black I'd continue.cheers}
