1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 {normal Queen's gambit declined opening} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 c6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 {I was expecting Bb4 here} 6. Bd3 {preparing to castle} Bd6 {he thinks so too} 7. O-O b6 8. a3 c5 9. Qa4 {pinning the knight} O-O {Qc3 would win a piece here} 10. e4 {I didn't see it... (and make a poor move!)} cxd4 {He relocates my knight and I am oblivious to the intent} 11. Nxd4 Ng4 {sadly, I still don't see the threat} 12. Qc6 {now I notice I could win a piece, but it's too late} Bxh2+ {I now see that I'm in trouble, but it's too late} 13. Kh1 {my only move} Qh4 14. g3 {the only way to delay mate I could think of...} Bxg3+ {Kg2 is forced... (Kg1 is followed by Qh2 mate)} 15. Kg2 {f3 is my only escape route} Qh2+ 16. Kf3 {forced again} Nde5+ {ouch! my Queen is forked!} 17. Ke2 {my only move again} Nxc6 18. Nf3 {try to get the queen to give my king some breathing room...} Qg2 {she doesn't want to go far} 19. Be3 {adding protection to the weak pawn ad linking the rooks} Nxe3 {well, I guess he's ready to start swapping pieces now (he is a Q up)} 20. Kxe3 d4+ {taking the pawn has serious consequences (Bxf2  and the knight is lost too )} 21. Ke2 dxc3 {another piece dies} 22. bxc3 e5 23. Ke1 {removes the pin on my pawn} Bxf2+ {he gives me a gift} 24. Rxf2 Qg3 25. Ke2 {my king must protect several pieces} Bg4 26. Raf1 {hopefully, doubling the rooks will releive some pressure} Rae8 27. Kd2 Na5 {a sneaky knight tries to slip in} 28. Kc2 {I don't want the knight getting thru to b3} f5 {he wants his rooks in on the battle} 29. exf5 {the alternative didn't look any better} e4 {a pawn fork} 30. Bxe4 Rxe4 {the rooks break thru} 31. Nd2 Re3 {all is lost now... it's just a matter of time} 32. f6 gxf6 {temporarily keeping one rook out} 33. Rf2f4 Rxc3+ 34. Kb1 {maybe I can for the rook and queen on my next move?} f5 {nope, he saw it} 35. Rf1f2 Qd3+ {with only two or three moves left, I decide to resign}
