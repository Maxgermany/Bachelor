O-O Na6 {Planning Nc7.} 9. h3 {This was to stop Ng4 because I wanted to go Be3.} Nd7 10. Be3 f5 11. f4 {WOW!! What a center attack!! That's the whole point of Nge2; it doesn't block the "f" pawn so I can fight for the centre.} Qe7 12. Qd2 Nf6 {Still fighting for the centre.} 13. fxe5 dxe5 14. dxe5 Qxe5 15. Bd4 Qc7 16. exf5 Bxf5 {WOW!! again!! The center has been exchanged and now we fight for mobility.} 17. Rad1 Rad8 {Threatening c5 winning my DSB} 18. Qf4 Qxf4 19.

Kg2 {Now he has to take.} Bxf2 38. Kxf2 {The material is equal but, he's low on time: less then 5 min.} Rf8 39. Kf3 Kg7 {A mistake, as you will see.} 40. Rd7+ {Wins a pawn} Kg6 41. Rxa7 h5 42.
