1. c4 {The queen's left the game early and a good battle ensued.  There was also a king move which may not be what would be expected.  Also the game looked to be good for white at around move 34/35 but was black defeated.  I think I used my king more than I have in any game so far and not just left him to his fate.} c5 {White started with c4 and I decided to stay on the same file with c5.} 2. e4 Nc6 {White came back with e4 and I developed my knight to c6.} 3. Nf3 e5 {White developed his knight to f3 and I went with e5.  We are both equal at this stage.} 4. d3 Nf6 {White now moved d3 protecting his pawns in the centre and I developed my knight to f6 attacking the e4 square.  White's f3 knight is attacking my e5 pawn.} 5. g3 d6 {White's prepares to financhetto his LB by moving pawn to g3 and I make space for my LB to access the diagonal by moving my pawn to d6.} 6. Qa4 Qa5+ {Now white moves his queen to a4 pinning my knight and I move my queen out to a5 checking his king.} 7. Qxa5 Nxa5 {So white captures my queen and I recapture with my knight.  The queens go out and its an even battle.} 8. Nc3 g6 {White now develops his knight to c3 and I prepare to fianchetto my DB with g6.} 9. h3 Bg7 {White moves pawn to h3 with the intention of stopping my LB coming down to pin the kight at g4.  I bring my DB to g7.} 10. Nb5 Kd7 {White pushes his knight to the b5 square and as I do not have any piece to prevent the knight from coming to c7 I decide to use my king to prevent that move.  I can no longer castle.} 11. Ng5 Rf8 {White moves his c knight to g5 so the 2 knights are in prime positions with the king in the centre.  I move my h rook to f8 to protect the f7 square as my knight can protect the h7 square.} 12. Be2 a6 {White prepares to castle by moving his LB out to e2 and I harrass the b5 knight with a6.} 13. Nc3 h6 {The b5 knight moves to c3 and I now harrass the other knight at g5 with the move h6.} 14. Nf3 b6 {This has worked and I now no longer have the knight on the 5th row.  White's knight has gone back to f3 and I push my pawn to b6 giving my king a place to safely castle and move out of the centre. } 15. Be3 g5 {White now moves his DB to e3 and I continue to prepare my attack on the king side with pawn to g5.  This stops the f3 knight from moving onto h4.} 16. b3 Kc7 {White moves pawn to b3 and I move my king over to c7 to get to safety.} 17. O-O Kb7 {Now white castles short and I have my king at b7 where it is safe from any immediate threats.} 18. Rab1 Bxh3 {White moves his a rook to b1 and I bring my LB to h3 to attack the rook at f1.  This bishop will find this a good spot to linger a while and may be useful later on.} 19. Rfe1 Ng4 {White removes his rook from danger to e1 and I bring my knight to g4 where there are many squares to attack but this knight may remain to cause annoyance and assist with any attack if white allows it to stay.} 20. Nh2 Nxe3 {So white moves his knight to h2 attacking my knight and I remove it to d3.  The knight is now attacking the 1st rank so white needs to watch where he puts his rooks. } 21. fxe3 Nc6 {White captures my knight at e3 and this now leaves the f file open.  I move my knight to c6 which gives my king protection from the LB which may access the diagonal from a8 to h1.} 22. a3 f5 {White now pushes his pawn to a3 and it looks like there is an attack coming on my king.  I push my pawn to f5 attacking the pawn at d4. My rook is at the top of the f file at f8.} 23. b4 g4 {White pushes a pawn to b4 and I now support my LB with pawn to d4.} 24. bxc5 Rfb8 {White moves his b4 pawn to c5 capturing my pawn and now the white rook at b1 is staring down the file to my king at b7.  I bring my f8 rook over to b8 to defend the b file.} 25. Nd5 Kc8 {With this move white brings his knight to d5 and I move my king up to c8 so my b8 rook can defend the b6 pawn should the knight try to take it.  I think at this stage the game is quite even.  Same number of pieces and we both have a pawn chain with a piece on the opponents part of the board.  White does have a strong centre and my pawns are connected and can cause a problem to white on the king side. } 26. cxb6 f4 {White captures my pawn at b6 and I push my pawn to f4 and attack white's pawns at e3 and g3.} 27. Rb3 f3 {White moves his rook to b3 and I continue to push my f pawn to f3 now attacking the bishop at e2.} 28. Bd1 Kb7 {White moves his bishop and I bring my king to b7 stopping the progress of the b6 pawn.} 29. Kf2 h5 {White moves is king to f2 to stop the progress of the f3 pawn and I support the pawn chain by moving pawn to h5.} 30. Nc7 Na5 {White now moves his d knight to c7 and I move my knight to a5 attacking whites rook at b3.} 31. Rb4 Nc6 {White moves his rook down to b4 and I move my knight to c6 and have the rook under attack again.  White's knight is still at c7 attacking my a8 rook but this can be recaptured by the b8 rook.} 32. Rb2 Nd8 {White retreats his rook to b2 and I move my knight to d8 in order to give some protection to the king.} 33. Ba4 Kc8 {White moves his LB to a4 and I move the king to c8.  With the knight at d8 I can pick up the pawn should it go to b7.} 34. Nxa8 Rxa8 {White now captures my a8 rook with his knight and I recapture with the rook on b8.} 35. b7+ Nxb7 {White pushes his b6 pawn and I recapture with my knight.  The rook is still on b2 now attacking my knight.  I need to move my king to safety.} 36. Rb6 Nc5 {White moves his rook to b6 and I move my knight to c5 attacking the LB at a4 and I am able to capture the LB if it moves to check the king on d7.} 37. Bc2 Kc7 {White's LB retreats to c2 and my king moves to c7 to attack the rook.} 38. Reb1 h4 {So white now brings his rook to b1 and rooks are now doubled on the b file.  I continue to attack the king by pushing my h pawn to h5 and attack the pawn at g3.  At present I am down 2 points, I only have one rook but I have 3 pieces; a pair of bishops and knight, against black's bishop and knight and 2 rooks.  But I have 6 pawns whilst white has 6 pawns with doubled pawns on e file.} 39. Rb6b4 Ra7 {White does not progress his attack and moves his rook back again to b4 and I move my rook to a7 protecting the b7 square which white may use to check the king.} 40. Nf1 Kd7 {White looks to provide some defence against my pawns which are surrounding him and he moves his knight to f1.  I try to get my king out of the way and king moves to d7.} 41. Ba4+ Ke6 {Whit's LB comes to a4 again attacking the king at d7 and I move the king to e6.  This looks a quiet spot for the king as there is a pawn at e5 and d6 providing cover to him.} 42. Bc6 Nxd3+ {White's LB comes to c6, a better place to reside than the a file as it gives the LB control of a few diagonals.  I now move my knight to e3 and check the king whilst skewering the rook at b4. } 43. Kg1 f2+ {White moves the king to g1 and I push my pawn up to f2 and continue to check the king with the pawn protected by the knight.} 44. Kh1 Nxb4 {The king moves out to h1 and I capture the rook at b4.  The knight is also attacking the LB at c6.  White's rook was at b1 and could have captured my knight but it was protecting the 1st rank from the impending attack by black.} 45. Nd2 a5 {White moves his knight to d2 and is protecting the square which I could use to queen my pawn but the file is also covered by the b1 rook.  I push my pawn to a5 looking to protect my knight at b4 from capture by the rook.} 46. axb4 hxg3 {White captures my knight but I am continuing to attack with my pawns.  White's move has blocked the b file which white may have thought would stop my rook coming down to attack the king.  Meanwhile I capture white's pawn at g3 so I have a pawn protecting my f2 pawn plus my LB at h3 is protecting the queening square.} 47. Bd5+ Kf6 {I was busy and did not see the threat from white's LB although it was very close to the king at c6.  So LB came to d5 and checked the king and I moved the king to f6 and there should be no more problems from the LB as king is now on a dark square and also LB has his own pawns blocking his path to protect the king.} 48. Nf1 g2+ {So white decides to block the queening square with his knight but with so many pawns this should not be a problem for black.  I push my g pawn checking the king and attacking the knight whilst protected by the LB at h3.} 49. Kh2 g1=Q# {White moves his king to h2 and with his knight blocking the rook, I queen my pawn and the game is over.}
