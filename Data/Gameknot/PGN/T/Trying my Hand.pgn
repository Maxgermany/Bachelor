[Opening "QGD Slav (D15), Tolush-Geller gambit"]

1. d4 {d4 is my best first move statistically so I played it.} d5 2. c4 {Queens gambit.} c6 {Slav defense} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 {Nc3 is flexible in case of e6 transposing into the semi-slav.} dxc4 {This is the main point of the slav black will try to hold onto his c4 pawn.} 5. e4 {This will transform into a gambit a4 may have been slightly better.} b5 6. e5 {forced if I want to hold onto my e pawn.} Nd5 7. a4 e6 8. axb5 {slight trick black plays the best Nxc3.} Nxc3 9. bxc3 cxb5 10. Ng5 {Took me a while to rationalize this move.  I felt that Be2 or Ba3 may have been slightly better, though this move doesn't have anything wrong with it.} Qd7 {Qd7 responds to Qf3.} 11. Qg4 {Qg4 seem more reasonable than Qh5 the other option for the queen.} Bb7 12. Be2 Bd5 {Black position is now very solid.} 13. O-O a5 14. Ba3 {Ba3 trades bishops and stops b4.} Bxa3 15. Rxa3 Qb7 16. f4 {This move took me about 20 minutes or so to play.  I was also thinking about Bf3 though I feel that I would be going backwards in development.} h6 {kicks my knight back.} 17. Nf3 b4 {I had expected O-O but black played b4 which is more fun!} 18. cxb4 axb4 19. Rxa8 Qxa8 20. Qxg7 {I finally got my pawn back but, the b and c pawns look ominous.} Rf8 21. f5 {Qxh6 would be too greedy.} Qa7 22. fxe6 Nc6 {Nc6 prepares the very strong Nxd4!} 23. exf7+ {This is probably the game winning mistake though blacks pawn are strong they are not quite decisive.  I got too greedy here I actually strengthened Nxd4.} Rxf7 24. Qxh6 Nxd4 {Now I'm in big trouble 25. Nxd4? Qxd4+ 26. Kh1 Rxf1! 27. Bxf1 Qf2 28. Qb1 now black has up a few tempos to play around with while I try to figure out how to not lose a whole piece.  So I chose a different option.} 25. Qh8+ {25. Qh8+?! Rf8(what I expected) 26. Qxf8+ Kxf8 27. Nxd4+ giving myself a chance.} Kd7 {Kd7?! this allows me to save my position in a better way.} 26. e6+ {e6+! Nxe6 must be played.} Nxe6+ 27. Kh1 Kd6 {Getting out of Ne5+} 28. Rd1 {Threatens Qe5+} Qc5 29. h3 {gives my king some room though not sure this was best here because it gives black time.} c3 30. Qb8+ Ke7 31. Qe5 {The point of Qb8+ though I'm completely lost after the next few moves.} Bxf3 {Best response and one I didn't consider for some reason.} 32. Qxc5+ Nxc5 33. Bxf3 {I resign here c2 forces a queen.}
