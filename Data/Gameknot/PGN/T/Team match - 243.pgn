1. e4 c5 {Sicilian} 2. d4 {2. Nf3 is another option} cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 {I like this variation. It gives white a lot of possibilities of attack which compensates the pawn late.} e6 {developping} 5. Nf3 {White has to develolop quickly.} Bb4 6. Bd2 {Safe option} a6 {To prevent 7. Bb5 and enable 7. ... d5} 7. a3 {Black has to move the DSB twice or to trade} Ba5 8. b4 {As white plans to castle short, pressing on the queenside is ok.} Bc7 9. Bc4 {preparing the castle and aiming at the center. White is far ahead in developpement} b5 {menacing the LSB} 10. Bb3 {A good place for the bishop} Nc6 11. O-O {king in safe, rooks and queen joined, white's developpement is almost completed.} Nf6 {Preparing the castle} 12.

Re3 {To protect the LSB and prepare to double the rooks.} Qb6 {Black is getting dangerous on the queen side. White still conrols the center but is getting attacked by the left wing.} 24. Nxc6 {I do not see other option than to exchange} Bxc6 {Trading} 25. Rec3 {Both rooks on the open file "you shall not pass"} Ba4 {"Mistake, white has now a winning position with the 2 rooks on the open file. 25. ... Rc8 would have been better (at least that's what I wrote during the game). It proved to be far more complicated for white.} 26. Bxa4 {trading} Raxa4 {26. ...

Qb3 Rdb4 {menacing the queen} 34. Qg3 {If 34. ... gxh4 35. Rxe8 + Kxe8 36. Qg8 +} Rbxh4 {But black is too advised and takes with the rook. White is now late in material.} 35. Rc5c7 {I have a plan (risky, because it implies to bring the queen near the rooks, i.e. the white lady won't protect her husband anylonger but stay here without trying to counterattack means death.} Rag4 {misatake.} 36. Qa3+ {White has now countergame available.} Rgb4 {to avoid moving the king.} 37. Rxe8+ {! If 37....  Kxe8 38. Qa8+mate} Kg7 {So that the black king has to hide.

Rxf6} 47. Qe3 {Srange position, black is surrounded but, as the white pieces are separated, they cannot give the assault for now.} h5 {to get some air.} 48. Re8 {Black is almost in zugzwang, I estimate that I can spend moves to prepare the decisive attack.} g4 {less dangerous than it seems. } 49. Rcc8 {mating menace. } Rxf2+ {Black's last chance.} 50.
