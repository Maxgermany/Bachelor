[Opening "Damiano's defence (C40)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 {This is the damiano defence, in which I have never encountered before. The purpose as most of you don't know, is that it can lull White into false security by 3.Nxe5 and then 4.Qh4+. } 3. Nc3 Ne7 4. Bc4 {I wanted to secure d5, not to expect something bad.} d6 5. Nd5 Nec6 6. d3 a5 {This is not sincere to me.} 7. Qd2 b6 8. O-O Nd7 {Black is building up a enclosement. At this stage, I was only aware what I can do about it.} 9. c3 a4 10. b3 Ra5 11. b4 Rxd5 12. Bxd5 {Soon, I realized how strong this really was. My only hope after these couple of moves, was to attack that enclosement.} Bb7 13. a3 g6 14. d4 h5 15. b5 Na5 {I was outraged by this move. My defence started a critical struggle...} 16. Qa2 {until this move.} f5 17. exf5 gxf5 {This was it, I am finally breaking through. Though only now did I meet something better than 18. dxe5...} 18. Bf7+ {It was the briliant 18. Bd7+!!. This lead to the endgame by a forced mate, other than checking him several times.} Ke7 19. Qe6# {So here it is, the 19 move mate by me, giving my team the first team match win against another team. That is the end of my 2nd annotated game.}
