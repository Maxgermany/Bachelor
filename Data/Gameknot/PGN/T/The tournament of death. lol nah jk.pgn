1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bf4 Nc6 4. Nf3 a6 {This move is absolutely wasted.  I do not see any point in it whatsoever.} 5. e3 {I look to develop my light-squared bishop.} Bf5 {Takes control of the square where I want to move my bishop to.} 6. Bd3 {Maybe Bc4 was better.  This leads to a bishop exchange which screws my pawn structure.  Bc4 would lead to dxc4.} Bxd3 7. cxd3 e6 8. O-O Bd6 9. Qb3 {I am keeping my bishop on the board temporarily.  The idea here is to start an attack on his queenside.} b5 10. Rac1 h6 {Another outside pawn move where something else is going on.} 11. Nxb5 Bxf4 12. Rxc6 axb5 13. Qxb5 {Black wins this exchange: a knight and a bishop for a knight and two pawns.} Rb8 {Threatens the queen.} 14. Rb6+ {Discovered check.} c6 15. Qxc6+ Nd7 16. Rb5 Rxb5 17. Qxb5 {Rooks are exchanged; material is even.  The knight is pinned hard.} Bd6 18. Rc1 O-O {Removes the pin on the knight.} 19. Qc6 Nb8 20. Qb7 f6 21. a4 {Passed pawn, so push it!!!} Rf7 22. Qb5 Rc7 23. Rxc7 Bxc7 {No more rooks.} 24. e4 Qc8 25. Qc5 Na6 26. Qc6 {Looking to grab some pawns.} Nb4 27. Qc3 dxe4 28. Qxb4 exf3 29. gxf3 g5 {And now we see the kings start to become open to attack.} 30. a5 Qa8 31. Qe7 Bxa5 32. Qxe6+ Kg7 33. Qe7+ Kg6 34. Qe4+ {The queen exchange was a bad idea.  I concentrated too much on the pawns.  Much better is e5} Qxe4 35. fxe4 f5 {I decide I would have a better chance of promoting this pawn if I advance it and do not take this pawn.} 36. e5 Bb6 37. e6 {Better is d5.  This move leaves the pawn vulnerable.} Bxd4 38. b4 Kf6 39. b5 Kxe6 40. Kg2 Kd6 41. b6 Bxb6 {White is in very bad shape.  That bishop proves to be the root of all evil.} 42. h3 f4 43. Kf3 h5 44. Kg2 {Better is Ke4.} g4 45. hxg4 h4 46. g5 Ke6 47. g6 Kf6 48. Kh3 {Better is Kf3, and after 48...Bc7 49. Kg4 Kxg6 I have a chance to draw or even win on a blunder by black.} Bxf2 49. d4 Kxg6 50. d5 Bc5 51. Kxh4 Kf5 52. Kh3 {I offer a draw after this move.  Declined.} Kg5 53. Kg2 Kg4 54. d6 Bxd6 55. Kf2 f3 {Zugzwang.  A situation when one would rather pass than move.  See white above.  Black can mark time with the bishop.} 56. Ke1 Kg3 57. Kf1 f2 58. Ke2 Kg2 {I resign here.  The pawn's gonna queen next move regardless of what I do.  Then all I can do is either (a) try for stalemate, (b) try for the 50-move rule, or (c) wait to get mated.  In all likelihood, Option (C) would happen.}
