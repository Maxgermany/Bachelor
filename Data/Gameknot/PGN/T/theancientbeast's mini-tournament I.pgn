1. e4 {This is a game from my first mini-tournament.} e5 2. d4 d6 3. f4 {Planning to overpower the e-pawn.} Nc6 4. Nf3 Bg4 {There goes my plan.} 5. h3 Bxf3 6. gxf3 Nf6 {Perhaps he should have taken the d-pawn.} 7. Nc3 exd4 {Now he does.} 8. Nd5 Nxd5 9. exd5 Ne7 10. Qxd4 {Equalizing.} Nf5 11. Qe4+ {"Aha!" I thought. "I'll get his Knight!" Then, I noticed} Ne7 {Then it hit me! A brilliant combo was staring me in the face! Can you find the crucial first move?} 12. Bb5+ {Bb5+!! Did you find it? My opponent resigned here because 12. ...c6 13.dxc6 bxc6 14.Bxc6+ Qd7 15.Bxc7+, or 12...Qd7 and he saves some pawns.  Thank you for reading! Please R&C!}
