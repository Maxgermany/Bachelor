1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 {gambit} 3. d3 {declining the gambit} Nc6 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Bg5 {pretty normal, just the sleeping king bishop and the gambit with the pawns} Be7 6. d4 O-O 7. h4 Bg4 {knight pinned} 8. Be2 {now not} Bb4 {other knight pinned} 9. Nxe5 Nxe5 10. dxe5 Nxe4 {g4 bishop exposed, queen is for free} 11. Bxd8 Bxc3+ {on this position i would not castle king side, so i would try not damaging the queen side but it seems you must if trying not to lose queen if knight recaptures, fork with queen and bishop, but queen can defend} 12. bxc3 Nxc3 13. Qd4 {see the idea knight take bishop, queen takes bishop and attack queen} Nxe2 14. Qxg4 Raxd8 {knight is for free} 15. Qxe2 c5 16. Rb1 {free file 7th rank danger} b6 {defending the pawn} 17. c4 d4 18. Qe4 Rde8 19. Kd2 {wonder why....} f6 20. e6 Re7 21. g4 Rfe8 {double rooks, so rook takes pawn queen needs to move. e file for the king is bad, kinda get move 19 if like with bishop x-ray attack can be made} 22. Rbe1 Re7xe6 23. Qb7 {hmmmm... not bad} Re6e7 24. Rxe7 {what i thought checkmate is nearing black resinged}
