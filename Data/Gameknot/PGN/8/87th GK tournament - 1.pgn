1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 a6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 b5 6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Qe2 {a minor variation...} Nc6 8. Nxc6 Bxc6 9. a4 {to challenge the b pawn and force the exchange or advance} b4 10. Nd5 {and now a nice temporary sacrifice} Bb7 {if exd5 then exd5+ would win back the minor piece with tempo, plus } 11. Ne3 {headed to c4} Bc5 12. Nc4 d5 13. exd5 Qxd5 {?! dubious better is Bxd5...} 14. Bf4 {I'll sacrifice a pawn for activity and to keep black's king on the center, preventing it from castling} Qxg2 {? now we get the idea of Qxd5 to attack g2, but is a poisoned pawn} 15. O-O-O {bringing another piece to the fight and defending Rh1, sacrifices another pawn that black could not afford to grab if:  a) Bxf2 then Nd6+ with a double attack loses the b7 bishop, and if Qxb7 he loses the second bishop...  b) Qxf2 then either Qxf2 Bxf2 Nd6+, or Nd6+ to diverge the bishop from the defense of the queen} Nf6 16. Rhg1 {threatens to grab g7} Qf3 17. Qe5 {doesn't allow 0-0 due to the pin that gives me the chance of playing Qxf6} Nd5 18. Bg5 {threatening to win at least a minor piece with Nd6+ Bxd6 Qxd6 and not the threat is Bb5 followed by Rxd5 and Qe7++}
