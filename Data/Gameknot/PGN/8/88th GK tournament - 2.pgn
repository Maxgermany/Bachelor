1. c4 {Definitely not one of my best games, I would appreciate any thoughts on where I may have done better} e5 {I've been experimenting with the English opening recently and decided to have a go with that} 2. g3 Nc6 3. Nc3 f5 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. e3 {This seems a bit passive but it was to give my g1 knight somewhere to go to, I didn't like the idea of Nf3,e4 and from e2 it could support e4} g6 6. Nge2 Bg7 7. d4 d6 8. Nd5 O-O 9. O-O Nxd5 10. Bxd5+ Kh8 11. Rb1 Ne7 {Chasing away the bishop which could get annoying if allowed to stay there.} 12. Bg2 c6 13. b4 g5 {This seemed a little risky to me but as my opponent was around 200 points north of my rating I guess he felt he didn't have to worry too much} 14. Bb2 f4 15. dxe5 f3 16. exd6 fxe2 17. Bxg7+ {What I was trying to do here was to get the black king a bit more exposed.} Kxg7 18. Qd4+ Kg8 19. Rfe1 Nf5 20. Qc3 Qxd6 21. Rxe2 Qf6 22. Qc2 {I decided not to exchange but I'm still not sure it was the right decision} Be6 23. Rd2 Rad8 24. Rxd8 Rxd8 25. a4 Nd6 26. c5 Nc4 27. Qc1 {preventing the fork on a3} Nd2 28. Rb2 {pretty much forced due to the fork threat on b3} Nf3+ 29. Kh1 {I didn't like the look of Kf1 was this a mistake?} Ne1 30. Rd2 {Looking to reduce blacks attacking force before its too late.} Nxg2 31. Rxd8+ Qxd8 32. Kxg2 Qd5+ 33. Kf1 {The final blunder, probably f3 was better} Qh1+ {Time for me to resign.  Please comment.}
