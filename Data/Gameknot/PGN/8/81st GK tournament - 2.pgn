[Opening "Dutch (A80)"]

1. d4 f5 {The Dutch (A80).} 2. Nf3 {Preventing Black from doing 2...e5?? unless he does 2...d6.} Nh6 {?! A dubious move; the knight is in the wrong place. Better was 2...Nf3.} 3. Nc3 Nc6 {I have a slight advantage due to well placed knights.} 4. Bf4 {I could have taken the knight, but the take is no better than this move.} d5 5. Ne5 {A partial mistake. After this move, I should play 6.Be3 or 6.Bg3 depending on what he does next.} Ng4 {With that, 6.Bg3 would be slightly better.} 6. Nxg4 {I became a bit greedy about the knight, but I've now asked for a knight trade.} Nxd4 {I think Black overlooked my position a bit. This move was a definite mistake:6...Nxd4?! 7.Qxd4 fxg4 8.Qxd5 and I'm a knight ahead in material.} 7. Qxd4 fxg4 8. Be5 {Instead of 8.Qxd5, I was desperate to win a rook.} e6 {With that, I had the option to gain more material with 9.Qxg4 and lose the Bishop for two pawns, or 9.O-O-O, which is safer.} 9. Bxg7 {A mistake for me. I got greedy about the pawn and the rook and forgot how mobile the rook actually is.} Rg8 10. f3 {Inaccurate. Better was 10.Be5} Bxg7 11. Qa4+ {A very safe check.} c6 {11.Bd7 would be a little more helpful.} 12. O-O-O Rb8 13. e4 Bh6+ {After castling queenside, the weakness on the h6-c1 diagonal increased, allowing this safe check to come into play. } 14. Kb1 b5 15. Qxa7 {An extra pawn, or am I asking for trouble? The answer is...................both!} Bd7 {Connecting both the rook and the queen} 16. exd5 {I try to punctuate the center.} exd5 17. Nxd5 {Black couldn't win much more after this.} gxf3 {I yet again ignore the Black pawn.} 18. Nf6+ {The knight check safrificed the knight for a rook!} Qxf6 19. Qxb8+ Qd8 {The Black queen rushes back to d8!} 20. Re1+ {Finally, I make a break through after a rather slow opening!} Kf7 21. Qxd8 {This move was okay, because I was trying to lure the rook off the pawn to win it.} Rxd8 {And sure enough, Black's rook gobbles up my queen...} 22. gxf3 {and I take his unguarded pawn to be ahead by 4 points.} b4 23. Bc4+ {I was only trying to stop the b-pawn from going to b3 until I realized that this was a check.} Kg6 24. Be6 Be8 25. Rhg1+ {Check #2: I am trying to lure the Black king into a spot where he doesn't want to be.} Kf6 26. Bg8 {Now is my chance to gain more points.} Bf7 {Taking the h7 pawn is now considered a mistake. } 27. Bxf7 Kxf7 {I needed to trade bishops to avoid his two move mate he tried to set up earlier.} 28. b3 {!? Risky, but well worth considering. } Bd2 {I was stunned to see this move, because he fell for a pin.} 29. Red1 {Preparing the unstoppable 30.Rg2.} h5 30. Rg2 {Now, I can get a bishop and a rook for a rook.} Bg5 {Maybe just a rook trade.} 31. Rxd8 Bxd8 32. Rd2 {I am playing a game called chase the bishop, and Black seems to be saying "I love this game!"} Bg5 33. Rd7+ Ke6 {I, on the other hand, didn't like chasing the Bishop, so I came up with a check and then this is where Black moves to?} 34. Rh7 {Bad move.} c5 {Not a good move either.} 35. Rxh5 {What does Black want to lose.} Kf6 {I guess he is not interested in losing anything, so I'm going to force him to lose something.} 36. h4 {!} Bd2 {Free pawn finally safe to take.} 37. Rxc5 Kg6 {38.h5+ is the best move.} 38. h5+ Kh6 39. Rd5 {Oh sure, I can handle a bishop for a pawn with no problem.} Bc3 {FINALLY! The c1 square is freed from the bishop. Unfortunately, a1 is a no-safety zone.} 40. Kc1 {Gaining the c1 square.} Kg7 41. Rc5 {Expecting 41...Bd4?.} Kh6 {Pawns, pawns, everywhere, and no where to move them. } 42. Kd1 {Though my f3 pawn is free, I want to move my king into action in...} Bb2 {3...} 43. Kd2 {2...} Ba3 {1...} 44. Ra5 {That was just a countdown for the  Black bishop to be trapped with at least two moves to free it.} Kg7 {This king move falls to 45.Rf5!} 45. Rf5 Kh6 46. c4 {A well placed king is hard to beat and this is exactly why.} Bb2 {The first move to free his bishop.} 47. c5 {My goal: pawn promotion.} Kh7 48. c6 {It is impossible to take the rook thanks to my well placed h5 pawn and it's impossible for any piece to stop the pawn promotion. My opponent resigned at this position.}
