1. f3 e5 2. g3 {g3 is an interesting second move here, conceding the middle of the board and giving the g1 Knight only one option of Nh3, but at least it wasn't g4, which would lead to ... Qh4#.} Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Be2 {Confusing at best, position is very confined and overprotective of the f3 pawn.} Bc5 {Continuing to develop pieces and establish control of the middle of the board.} 5. c3 O-O 6. b4 {First aggressive move forcing the Bishop to retreat to d6 or e7.} Bd6 7. a4 b6 {Preparation for almost obvious move of a5.} 8. a5 e4 {I decide not to take the a5 pawn and instead attack the overprotected f3 pawn to weaken his right side.} 9. axb6 {Trying to bait a response of 9. ... axb6 10. Rxa8} cxb6 10. Nh3 a5 {I would rather he attack my pawn on e4 so I can move my Knight on f6 into a better position, preferrably to g5.} 11. fxe4 Nxe4 12. Bf3 {He attacks the e4 pawn and then moves his Bishop, and my Knight is now in position to move to the g5 square protected by my Queen and attack his isolated Knight on h3.} Ng5 13. Nxg5 Qxg5 {We trade Knights and I develop my Queen.} 14. b5 {A solid move, he attacks my pinned Knight.} Na7 {Forgetting the pin I mistakenly move to attack the pawn.} 15. Bxa8 Qxb5 16. Ba3 {Again, a pin onto the Rook, this time with a Bishop pinned.  I probably should have traded Bishops even though it would allow him to attack my Queen with his Knight, and force him to scatter his position too much.} Be5 {Unfortunately...} 17. Bxf8 {I forgot the pin again.} Kxf8 18. Qa4 {He attacks my Queen, leaving only either a trade, Qd3, or Qa6.} Qd3 {A trade is obviously not a good idea in this situation, and Qa6 leaves my Queen too confined, Qd3 moves my Queen back on to a move open field.} 19. Be4 {A continued assault on the Queen that allows him to grab the h7 pawn.} Qd6 20. Bxh7 Bb7 21. Be4 Bxe4 22. Qxe4 {With his Bishop finally off of the longest white diagonal, I decide to attack his h1 Rook.  He moves his Bishop back to e4 and we swap.} Nc6 23. d4 Bf6 24. Rf1 Ne7 {Since he now has control of the middle I need to to try and consolidate my position.  Eventually I plan to move the Knight to take out either the c3 or e3 pawn to greatly weaken his extended pawn line.} 25. Na3 Qb8 {I cannot move my Queen into a proper position to counter Nb3 as an attack on the d6 square, so I have to retreat it.} 26. Nc4 d5 {His mistake of Nc4 allows for the pawn fork of his Queen and Knight, and gives me a more open position where I only need to worry about linear movement.} 27. Qd3 dxc4 28. Qxc4 Qd6 29. Rb1 Kg8 {With my King on f8 pinned behind my two pawns and Knight, I need to allow for an escape to h7 to prevent a simple backline checkmate.} 30. Qa6 Qe6 31. Kd2 {With his Queen now very limited in range of movement since it is behind both my a5 and b6 pawns, I can start attacking beginning with the e3 pawn, which he defends with Kd2.} Nd5 32. Qc4 {He defends with Qc4 to pin my Knight to my Queen, which would make a fork of Ne3 a bad idea costing me a Queen and Knight to his Queen.  However, Qd3 would've been a much better move, as now his King is very vulnerable to Qxe3 and so forth.  Eventually, it's this move that really ends up costing him.  While I would've responded to Qd3 with ... Bg5 putting further pressure on the e3 pawn, he could still be in a position to defend the crucial e3 pawn with one of his rooks.} Qxe3+ {So I begin my attack.} 33. Kc2 {Note that Kd1 would result in a trade of his Queen for my Knight with the following:  33. Kd1 Nxc3+ 34. Qxc3 Qxc3} Qe4+ 34. Kb3 Ne3 {Now I fork his Queen and Rook with the move I had already prepared two moves ago.} 35. Qc8+ Kh7 36. Rfe1 {He saves both his Queen and Rook by attacking my King forcing it to h7, but then makes the mistake of trying to save his rook by pinning my Knight to my Queen.  This mistake will eventually cost him his Queen and one Rook to my Bishop and my Knight when I place his King into check with three consecutive moves.  A better move would have been Rc1 to defend against Qc2+ even though it trades his Rook on f1 for my Knight.  Rf2 would also defend the c2 square, but allow for me to play ... Qxb1+ taking his Rook without trading my Knight, as well as continue attacking his King.} Qc2+ {The first check forces his King to move to a3.} 37. Ka3 Be7+ {This second check forces him to block the check with either his Queen or his Rook.  If he blocks with his Queen, I can take it off with bxc6 and then if he takes my Knight with his Rook on e1, I can use cxd4+ to put his King in check again with my Bishop and force mate in a few different varations, but nonetheless force Rb4 dxe3 taking his Rook on e3 and leaving the other one pinned to his King, continuing on in something like mate in 5 as follows:  41. g4 Qxc3+  42. Ka2 Bxb4 (this move takes off his second rook) 43. g5 Ba3 44. g6+ fxg6 or g6+ Kxg6 45. Kb1 Qb2#} 38. Rb4 {So, instead of blocking with his Queen, he makes the smarter move of blocking with his rook.} Bxb4+ {And the third check.  This forces cxb4 and results in Qxc8.} 39. cxb4 Qxc8 40. Rxe3 {So after Rxe3 the exchange is complete, he will be down to just the Rook and pawns versus my Queen and pawns.} axb4+ 41. Kxb4 Qc2 {Now I start to begin setting up forks with my Queen, trying to capture his Rook.} 42. d5 {This is a questionable move, allowing me to fork his King, Rook, and d5 pawn by playing ... Qd2+.} Qd2+ 43. Rc3 {He effectively protects his Rook, but his d5 pawn is now gone and this game is virtually over.} Qxd5 44. Rc4 Qd2+ 45. Rc3 {By playing Rc3 instead of something like Kb5, he allows me to take off his h2 pawn and still be able to get back to protect my pawn on b6.} Qxh2 46. Kb5 Qf2 47. g4 Qd4 48. Rc4 {A good move here as he protects his g4 pawn and Rook at the same time after the move of ... Qd4.  However, I might not have taken off the g4 pawn in exchange for my pawn at b6 since his pawn isn't really a threat, and I would rather keep three pawns on the board instead of just two.} Qd6 49. g5 {Not a very good move here.  I can go Qd5+ and take his pawn with no consequence.} Qd5+ {If he responds here with anything other than Kb4, he loses his Rook.  He has four other moves to make.  1. Rc5 would result in Qxc5+ 2. Ka4 would result in Qxc4+ 3. Kxb6 would result in Qxc4 4. Ka6 would result in Qxc4  Note that Kb4, being the only move that protects his Rook, also prevents him from taking my pawn on b6 when I play ... Qxg5.  I could also have played this move one turn earlier, although his pawn would not have been on g5.} 50. Kb4 Qxg5 51. Rc6 {I can still protect my pawn while keeping my Queen with one of three moves.  Qe3 and Qe8 can accomplish this...} Qa5+ {... but Qa5+ is much better} 52. Kc4 f5 {I could've gone Qc5+ here and forced a trade that would've eliminated his rook.  However, his King was close enough that I couldn't just automatically move my pawn on g7 all the way down for a Queen.  Therefore, there was no reason to trade my Queen just to eliminate his last power piece.} 53. Kd4 Qb4+ 54. Rc4 Qd6+ 55. Kc3 b5 {Continuing to slowly move pawns forward into position while keeping them in a position that I can defend both at the same time with my Queen.} 56. Rb4 Qc6+ 57. Kb3 g5 {Preparing the third pawn for attack and defending versus Rh4+ at the same time.} 58. Rxb5 {Most likely a resignation move here.} Qxb5+ 59. Kc3 f4 {Since his King was close enough to catch either pawn before they reached the end line I decided to just start moving my f column pawn and then protect it with my Queen or eventually move the g column pawn if necessary.} 60. Kd2 f3 61. Ke1 Qe2# {It wasn't.}
