1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h3 Bg7 5. d3 d6 6. Nc3 Nc6 {My opponent opened with a King's Gambit, so whatever else the game may be it will be interesting.} 7. Bd2 Be6 {With my K-side pawns disrupted, I decide castling Q side might be safest.} 8. Qe2 Qe7 {Now I'm in position...} 9. O-O-O O-O-O {...to do just that. My opponent, thinking that the main theater of action would be the K side, does likewise.} 10. Nd5 Bxd5 {The tactics begin. I desire to simplify the game, as I'm a Pawn ahead, so I will take every opportunity to exchange.} 11. exd5 Qxe2 {Well, this helps. With the Queens gone, a sudden mating attack by my opponent is much less likely. I am holding out hopes of swapping down, queening my extra Pawn in an end game and winning.} 12. Bxe2 Ne5 {This Knight had to move and this looks like the best spot.} 13. Rdg1 h6 {Strengthening my defenses. I can see a K-side attack coming.} 14. g3 fxg3 {Undoubling my Pawns.} 15. Rxg3 Ne7 {I'm trying to connect my Rooks.} 16. c4 Nxf3 {Another piece falls.} 17. Rxf3 f6 {Solidifying my Pawns.} 18. Bc3 Rhf8 {Now my Rooks are connected....} 19. Rhf1 Ng8 {...even when I do this. I'm up a Pawn but White seems to have the initiative.} 20. Rf3f2 c5 {Hoping to lock the Q-side as well...} 21. dxc6 e.p. bxc6 {..but White prevents this.} 22. Bg4+ Kc7 {Sheltering where I can.} 23. Kd2 Rde8 {Cutting off the White King's route.} 24. Ba5+ Kb7 {Ducking clear.} 25. Bc3 Kc7 {Draw agreed. Neither side can make progress.}
