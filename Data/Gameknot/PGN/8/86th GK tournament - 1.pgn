1. e4 {Hello! This is a game where I thought i was well of from the opening but followed a faulty plan and made a lot of errors and lost in the end. And what shall we do when we lose in a way that alomost disgust us? We take the whip and torment ourselves some more and hopefully learn a lesson!} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3 {Now we have a sort of delayed sort of the c3-sicilian - black won't be able to play ...d5 in one move, but then again, the move e5 which white frequently uses in case of ...Nf6 is not so easily arranged.} Nf6 4. Bd3 {This looks slightly unnatural, as white possibly loses a tempo because he will have to play Bc2 in order to play d4.} Nc6 5. O-O g6 {I wanted to contest the d4-square and keep the c8-h3 diagonal open for the LSB, though I bet there's nothing against the more passive looking development with ...e6, ...Be7 etc.} 6. Bc2 Bg7 7. d4 cxd4 8. cxd4 O-O 9. Nc3 Bg4 {Both sides are developing somewhat naturally, and I think I thought (though I'm not sure anymore, it's some time ago when I played this move) that ...Bd7 looked like a move that does nothing positive as it is handy to have the possibility of ...Nd7 open. Black probably shouldn't mind exchaning this bishop because it lacks a duty.} 10. Be3 {possibly preparing 11.h3} Nd7 {The natural move. d4-pawn is already under some pressure.} 11. d5 {This looks positionally suspect. Now all black pieces except the LSB have potential to be monsters!} Nce5 12. Rc1 {If we accept that black has the advantage after the next three moves, then this would be the mistake. Maybe 12.Bb3 would be better, preventing the next?} Nc4 {black is playing for static advantages. The attack against the b-pawn is actually quite irritating as whites queens knight has no other defenders at the moment. That attack is parried easy enough but black counted on getting some play after 13...Nxe3.   The other way to create pawn weaknesses is 12...Nxf3 but the idea looks a little suspect as white would get the important e5 square with gxf3 and eventually f4} 13. Bb3 {Now if ...Nxb2 the knight is trapped so...} Nxe3 14. fxe3 {And the opening stage is pretty much over. IMO black has the advantage seeing that he has the better pawn structure, long term dark-square pressure and an no obvious weaknesses. The bishop pair does not seem to be anything to boast in this position though I think I didn't understand it during the game. I still feel a sting in my soul when looking at this position and thinking that I managed to lose in the end...} Qb6 {Seemed like the obvious square for the queen.} 15. Qd2 Bh6 {continuing to pressure the e3-pawn. Black wanted to tie as many pieces as possible in defending and the find a way to make something positive happen.} 16. Rce1 Nc5 {This is probably the first thing that indicates that black is not understanding the position. I had a fleeting thought that if i combined pressure against e3- and e4-pawns I could bottle up white for good and then induce some more weaknesses, but of course I didn't realize that i have no way to attack the e4-pawn more than once. And what about the rooks, where do they want to be? on the c-file, of course, so why block it?   I was afraid that if I didn't move the knight, I would have to reply ...Bxf3 if white played h3. This is quite understandable I think, and this move might even be a good one, but my thought process went a little astray at this point.  The problem for black here is the light squared bishop. It has nowhere to go and ...Bxf3 is a bad trade as gxf3 followed by f4 obviously improves whites posiotion. Ideally black would like to exchange it with white's lsb, play knight to e5 (with the intention to go to g4 or c4) and if white plays b3 then exploit the c-file and c3-square.} 17. Bd1 Rac8 18. Nd4 {Both sides strive to have their pieces in their natural squares, though i think this is an positional error on whites side. As i said before, black is the one who benefits the exchange of the light squared bishops.} Bd7 {This seems like a serious mistake. Afterwards I think the correct plan is 18...Bxd1 19. Rxd1 Nd7 heading for e5 and c4 or g4. Then white would have to think how to defend.   During the game I remember thinking that White was cramped and I should avoid exchanges. But that's not really true as white is just tied defending the pawn weaknesses and is just about ready gain some activity. Now if we look the position we see that it is black who is sligthly cramped - the knight and bishop needs the same squares. And what purpose the LSB have anyway? } 19. Kh1 {Moving the king away from the potential pin.} a5 {Black continues to insist that the knight belongs to c5 - though after 18...Bd7? it is hard to relocate the knight. This is played to discourage white for playing for b4 as the c4-knight has no decent escape square.} 20. Be2 Be8 {Now black is forced to accept that his thinking has been far from ideal and attempts to relocate the knight. It's not same anymore as the white LSB is great with it's defensive duties and controls the essential c4 and g4 squares. I was still feeling optimistic however, as I thought the loss of time was not very important as white has no obvious plans to activate his forces. } 21. Bg4 {a clever move! Black doesn't want to lose his knight and be left with the irritating LSB that has been worse than useless for a couple of moves so he simply plays...} Bd7 22. Bd1 Rcb8 {Playing for a win. Now ...Bc8 threatens ...Nd7 without allowing Bg4 } 23. Rf2 {White doubles on the f-file. Black ignores it and rigthly so, but in the end white will seize initiative on the kingside. Funny...} Bc8 24. Ref1 Nd7 25. h4 {So what about the attack? Black decides that it's just creating more weaknesses and doesn't take it too seriously until too late... but as black really can't prevent h5, it's better to stick with the plan.} Ne5 26. b3 {taking away the c4-square. Black is in no position to achieve anything on the c-file due his plan that required un-development.} Qd8 {Thinking about tricks with ...e6 or ...e5 as white will have to defend the h4-square in some way} 27. g3 {simply cutting the nonsense.} Bd7 {trying to get the c-file again.} 28. h5 Rc8 29. hxg6 Nxg6 {This looks weird. Either pawn capture would've been better. Now it seems black is almost busted on the kingside. } 30. Nce2 Bg4 {Still thinking it is blacks advantage to exchange the LSBs this seems a mistake though, as it is useful to have some of the light squares covered in the kingside. Black still couldn't believe he is on the defensive...} 31. Nf4 Bxd1 32. Qxd1 Rc3 33. Qh5 {Black is busted. Sigh.} Bg7 34. Rh2 h6 35. Nf5 Nxf4 {last try.} 36. gxf4 {No luck. 1-0  So what did I learn? I will have to accept my mistakes earlier, asses the positions objectively and not to play for a win when i have no advantage. I thank my opponent for this game and the other one where I have white pieces, still in progress and unclear. I will annotate that too, hopefully with happier results.  Give comments, share thoughts!  }
