1. e4 {This game deserves annotating as it ends with a "smothered mate," something that I had read about, and get to spring on someone about once or twice a lifetime.  } d5 {My standard answer to e4:  The Scandinavian, Modern Variation.  } 2. e5 c5 {Thwarts 3. d4} 3. Bb5+ Bd7 {Black his happy to accept an exchange, and he gains a tempo in development (if BxB, NxB).} 4. a4 {This gives Black a chance to seize the initiative.} Bxb5 {Black doubles White's pawns, a permanent liability.} 5. axb5 e6 {Black tidies up his pawn formation, and makes room for the Kside development.  Note that Black has a better pawn structure, and has gained a move (White has two pawns developed, Black three).} 6. Nf3 {A logical completion of Kside development.} Nd7 {Black's development is made difficult by the pawns that White has advanced to his side of the board.  Some discomfort there.} 7. d3 {White hopes to release his B at c1.} Ne7 {Black plans to put pressure on e5.} 8. Be3 Ng6 9. d4 {White has taken two moves to get this pawn to d4, losing another tempo.} b6 {Black naively hopes for dxc, ...Bxc5, developing the Bishop.} 10. Bg5 {Black loses another tempo by moving the B again.  "Never move one piece twice until all pieces have been moved at least once," I read somewhere.} Be7 {This defensive move also threatens to win a piece (BxB, NxB, QxN).} 11. Bxe7 {The third move by the B and now it is removed from play.  A waste of time.} Qxe7 {A developing move.} 12. O-O O-O {Both sides complete an early objective:  King safety.} 13. dxc5 Nxc5 {Black is happy to excahnge a center pawn for a side pawn, whilst advancing his N to a more menacing position.  } 14. b4 Ne4 {And now the night is in a very good spot, the B4 pawn is under attack.} 15. Ra4 {A bad spot (and role) for a Rook.} Rfc8 {Controlling c3.} 16. Nd4 {White threatens Nc6, but forgets that every move has two consequences (attacking some squares, relinquishing control of others.  The e5 pawn has been abandoned.  Black can take, and defend c6.} Nxe5 17. Qh5 {The Q at h5 is a one piece attack.  White attacks the e5 pawn, but has no other help on the Kside.} Qf6 {Defends e5, and makes an "X-Ray" attack on the N on d4.  The b1 N is looking rahter useless.} 18. Nc6 {White blunders here, losing a pawn.} Nxc6 19. bxc6 Rxc6 20. f3 {This weakening of the pawns in front of the King opens the diagonal to the W King, and sets up the final denouement.  Black sees the "smothered mate" possibility.} Qd4+ {The first move.  White must lose the exchange (R for N), or the game.} 21. Kh1 Nf2+ {This is an important sequence to remember.  If RxN, White wins the exchange and threatens mate.  Note that the undeveloped N and the misplaced major pieces are out of play.} 22. Kg1 {And now the discovered double check looms, forcing the "smothered mate."} Nh3+ 23. Kh1 {A queen sacrifice is in order.  Everything is forced here.} Qg1+ {Beautiful.} 24. Rxg1 Nf2# {I love it when a plan comes together! My opponent is faring much better in our other game.  Respect to him!}
