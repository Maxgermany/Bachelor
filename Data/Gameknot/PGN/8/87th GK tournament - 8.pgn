1. d4 {black blundered a piece in a very sharp opening variation, the game soon ended} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {King's Indian (E61), Smyslov system} 4. Nf3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. h3 e5 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Bg5 c6 10. Nxe5 Re8 11. O-O-O Be6 {N until now all the moves were already played here black played this novelty, but I don't see any point unless maybe to develop a piece, and try to calm down the game} 12. Nf3 {Nf3-d4 is the idea to force the developed bishop back on his tracks} Na6 13. Nd4 {and now the bishop has to move} Nd7 {?? loses a piece to Nxe6 removing the defender from the d7 knight if black recaptures on e6 I have Rxd7} 14. Nxe6 Bxc3 {the best black has disturbs my pawn structure, but exchanges another piece, already material down (he has tow pieces "en prise") black should avoid exchanges } 15. bxc3 Rxe6 16. Rxd7 {Rxe4 Re7 to exchange rooks} Nc5 {!? surprised me a bit} 17. Re7 {still I have Re7 forcing the exchange} Rxe4 18. Rxe4 {Nxe4 and Be3 to consolidate maybe Nxc3 Kc2 Nxa2 Kb3 wins the knight} Nxe4 19. Be3 {consolidation} Nxc3 20. Kc2 {now if Nxa2 Kb3 wins the knight} Ne4 21. Bd3 Nf6 22. Rb1 {threatens both a7 and b7 pawns}
