1. e4 c5 {in the past couple of months I'm trying to adapt myself to the Sicilian. Not sure if I know the basic principles yet but lets play} 2. Nc3 {Nf3 is more usual, but this is ok to put pieces at play} Nc6 3. f4 {white trying to dominate the center not very usual but interesting} g6 {one of the problems I'm facing with the Sicilian is that B in f8 the best way to put it to play is Bg7 } 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bc4 {developing pieces} e6 {taking pressure away from Ng5, threatening xf7 problem: the B in c8  not sure if d6 is better...} 6. O-O Nge7 {preparing the castle. allows f5 latter and let's Bg7 have a more important role in this part of the game} 7. a3 {I don't see why this was played.  preparing b4? preventing the pinning of the N?  if some of the comments just could help me on this one} O-O {naturally} 8. d3 d5 {fighting for the center and giving space for the pieces} 9. exd5 {I wouldn't have done this. the king is poorly protected and the B is about to stay out of the game ... forever} exd5 {naturally} 10. Ba2 a6 {don't want the N to come to b5. another piece with limited action} 11. g3 {why protecting f4?} Bg4 {pinning the N and bringing the B to play} 12. Qe1 {Unpinning and taking care of the e column.   The Q is squeezing the R and the K, not allowing them to breed. that will be a problem!  of course Re1 is possible} Nd4 {building up pressure near the K if the N isn't taken I was up to Nxc2} 13. Nxd4 {was this the best option? or the only option? probably Kg2, but then Qd7 and Bg3} Bxd4+ {is the game already won?} 14. Kh1 {only move} Qd7 {preparing Bh3} 15. Ne2 {understandable. now white must diminish the pressure, probably hopping for Bxe2?} Nf5 {protecting Bd4 and increasing the options near the white K} 16. c3 Be3 {if Bxe3, Nxe3; Rf2, Nc2 and Ra1 is gone} 17. Bb1 {protecting c2 so that BxB is possible} d4 {preparing Qd5 and a certain #} 18. Bxe3 {well done} Nxe3 {if dxe3 I would have a passed pawn with limited possibilities and white would play d4 and the B would come to play} 19. Rf2 {if Rg1, mate with Qd5} Rfe8 {This was fundamental to defend the very important Ne3. thinking in doubling R's or Qd5?} 20. Qg1 Qd5+ {the beautiful finale} 21. Rg2 Bf3 22. h4 Bxg2+ 23. Kh2 Ng4# {}
