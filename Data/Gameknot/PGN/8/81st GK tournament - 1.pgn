1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. a3 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {A rather tame opening variation by my opponent, not putting pressure on me at once as White can do with certain choices of opening.} 6. h3 O-O 7. d3 h6 8. Nd5 Nxd5 {I naturally don't want to let White plant his Knight on a powerful central outpost, hence the exchange.} 9. Bxd5 Nd4 10. Nxd4 Bxd4 {For similar reasons, White exchanges off my Knight. I have a slight advantage in development but the position is fairly even.} 11. c3 Bb6 12. Qh5 Be6 {I cut off the attack on KB2 at once.} 13. c4 Bxd5 14. cxd5 Bd4 {Mow that White's KB is off the board, I can afford to try and generate my own attack on his K-side, where I assume he will place his King.} 15. g4 Qf6 {Focusing on *White's* KB2.} 16. O-O Qg6 {With my attack momentarily cut off, I decide to offer an exchange of Queens just to see if White wants to go into the endgame.} 17. Qh4 Qf6 {I refocus on White's KB2...} 18. Qxf6 gxf6 {...and this time he does exchange Queens, blunting the lance somewhat. Now I'll need to get my Rooks over to the K-side to generate something.} 19. Bxh6 Rfe8 {First, I have to dodge White's B.} 20. Rab1 Kh7 {Clearing the KN1 square for my Rook.} 21. g5 fxg5 {I simply take the offered Pawn, incidentally trapping White's B. This error enables me to open the lines leading to the White King.} 22. Bxg5 Reg8 {Pinning...} 23. h4 f6 {...and winning...} 24. Kh2 fxg5 {...the Bishop.} 25. hxg5 Rxg5 {Now White's King is trapped on the KR file. My plan is simply to move my other Rook there and discover mate with a King move.} 26. f4 Rg4 {I have to dodge the Pawn's jab.} 27. f5 Rh8 {Moving my second Rook into position.} 28. Kh3 Rg7 {There is nothing White can do now...} 29. Kh4 Kg8# {..about this move.}
