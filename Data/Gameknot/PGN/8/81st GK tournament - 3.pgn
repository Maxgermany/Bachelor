1. e4 {This was an interesting game, but it started with this common move.} e5 {and a common response} 2. Nf3 {I like the kings knight opening.  It develops a piece as well as results in me guarding 4 critical squares, one of which is occupied by that black pawn.} f6 {kings knight might result in a response like this, but it weakens kings side for black.  If black was worried about losing the pawn, Nc6, Qe7, or Bd6 would have done the job and developed a piece.} 3. d4 {probably could have just taken that pawn and pull the queen out on that weak king side, but ill get there in a bit} d6 {and now blacks queen and bishop are virtually trapped.} 4. c3 {so that might be a nice place to attack from} g5 {hmm... seems to weaken that side more } 5. Bc4 {im dnoe with this pawn moving game, lets get this thing started.  I was thinking about creating a skewer with Qb3.  possibly getting his knight and rook for a bishop...} Ne7 {but he beat me to it, and moved his first significant piece but it was only to the 2nd row.} 6. Bxg5 {now this may not have been the best plan, but here's my thought:  If he doesn't bite at the bishop than I take a free pawn,  If he does take it, read on...} fxg5 {he bit} 7. Nxg5 {set myself up for some dinner... anyone have a fork?} Nd5 {oh you want to take my knight?} 8. Qh5+ {I have different thoughts} Kd7 {the other option resulted in checkmate} 9. Nf7 {Oh great a fork! let's eat!} Qf6 {so he can take my knight...} 10. Nxh8 {still worth the trade.} Qxh8 {no sweat... hey what's that horse doing outside of its corral?} 11. Bxd5 {i wrangled him... and now im thinking 'how do i end this thing mercifully?'  the end game has been my struggle of late.  } exd4 {he's going to survive for awhile on that diagonal} 12. cxd4 {i probably took that pawn one move too soon.  this would have been a good time to castle... I know many of you would say I should have done that a long time ago.  } Qxd4 {so he wants my rook, but can i keep him in check for awhile? } 13. Qf7+ {yes, at this point i have a pretty good idea about this.   Look what happened to the king side!  whites strategy was disastrous} Be7 {i figured...but my plan allows for this} 14. Qe6+ {ooo... move it, kingy!} Kd8 {keeps the bishop safe} 15. Qg8+ {third straight check, but its gotta end soon} Kd7 {all those checks did was move my queen into position...} 16. O-O {now lets take care of this rook situation... oh yeah and keep my king safe} Qxb2 {just as i thought, but this will benefit me more than him...} 17. Nc3 {bait set... } Qxc3 {taken! now I will pin that queen to the king... what?  their not lined up?} 18. Be6+ {looks like I still have some work to do.} Kc6 {no problem.  now theyre lined up} 19. Rfc1 {pin.  I chose the king side rook because with Qe8 the kings only escape is the b file and queens rook is still available to strike from there.} Qxc1+ {sacrifice.  i have to admit, i would have felt pretty hopeless if i was black at this point.} 20. Rxc1+ {my only move} Kb6 {he's just on the run now} 21. Qxc8 {finally ended the bishops game.  I imagine him staring in the face of my queen, all the time watching this happen to his king.  Sad.} c5 {probably would have taken that pawn next if not for this move.  So how do I end this?  im sure ive already missed a forced mate right?  } 22. Rb1+ {another check, this will trap him on the a file} Ka6 {could have extended his life a little longer with Ka5, but its inevitable now} 23. Qxb7+ {only one option from here} Ka5 {thats it!  nice game...} 24. Qb5# {oh yeah, now that's it.  Kind of a short game, but an interesting attack.  remember it started with that sacrificed bishop. ok, who wants to play? }
