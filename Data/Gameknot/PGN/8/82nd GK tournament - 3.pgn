1. e4 c5 {I played the Sicilian to sharpen my skills.} 2. Bc4 e6 {e6 is probably better than d6 right here.} 3. Nc3 a6 {Prepare for b5 which gains tempo by attacking the bishop and could prepare for a minority attack.} 4. d4 cxd4 5. Qxd4 {White should've played Nf3 since I can now play Nc6 with tempo.} Nc6 6. Qe3 d6 7. Nf3 b5 8. Bb3 Bb7 {Developing my LSB.} 9. a4 {White attempts to destroy my pawn structure.} b4 10. Ne2 {I advance to avoid a fractured pawn structure.} a5 {DEfends the pawn on b4.} 11. Ned4 Rc8 12. O-O Nf6 13. h3 Qb6 {Attacks the knight on d4 one more time and attempts to simplify the game because I believe that black is slighty better here.} 14. Nxc6 Qxe3 15. Bxe3 Bxc6 16. Nd2 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Rac1 Be7 19. f3 Bg6 20. Bb6 Bd8 21. Bxd8 Rxd8 {I'm trying to simplify my position even further since I have an extra pawn} 22. c3 Rb8 23. c4 O-O 24. Rfe1 Rfd8 25. g4 Rbc8 26. f4 h6 27. h4 Rd7 {The position is favouring me so far but you'll never know if I'll blunder!!}
