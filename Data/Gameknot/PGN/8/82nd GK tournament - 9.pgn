1. d4 {I don't know how many times I had lost hope in this game. I was completely outplayed for the majority of the game...and just when I deep in the trenches expecting the inevitable final blow, I threw caution to the wind and went for it! Enjoy} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bh4 Be7 7. e3 O-O 8. Qc2 Nbd7 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Bd3 a6 11. a4 Ng4 12. Bg3 f5 13. h3 Ngf6 14. O-O Ne4 15. Bh2 b6 16. Ne2 {This is moment when my troubles began. Haapala's knight begins to roam noticing considerable gaps in my pawn structure, nice holes to place a knight.} Bb7 17. Nf4 Rf6 18. Nh5 Rg6 19. Rac1 Rc8 20. Qe2 a5 21. Ba6 Bxa6 22. Qxa6 Ra8 23. Qb7 Bd6 {A bad mistake by me. A bishop exchange on D6, ultimately leads to a Queen exchange and as a result the C rook can invade the 7th row. Luckily for me Haapala decided not to exchange!   24. Bxd6 Nxd6 25. Qc7 Qxc7 26. Rxc7 Nf8 27. Nf4 Rf6 28. Ne5 Nc4 29. Nh5 Nxe5 30. Rxg7+ Kh8 31. dxe5 Rg6 32. Rc7 Nh7 Best: -1.41 » … Qe8 24. Rc7 Rd8 25. Qc6 Ng5 26. Nxg5 hxg5 27. Rc1 Kh8 28. Kh1 Rh6 29. g4 fxg4 30. hxg4 Bb4    } 24. Qc6 Bxh2+ 25. Kxh2 {I had escaped a very bad move 23, and wasted no time to exhange bishops, and quite hopeful seeing the white king somewhat exposed.} Qe8 26. Nh4 Rg5 27. Nf4 Nd2 {My position was getting worse with each move...and unsure how to proceed, I gambled and attemped to upset Haapala's back rank. In hindsight this move was another bad one, which could have lost the game for me.     Nd2 28. Rfd1 Ne4 29. Nxe6 Nxf2 30. Nxg5 hxg5 31. Qxd5+ Kh8 32. Ng6+ Kh7 33. Rf1 Nd3 34. Rc7 Rd8 35.

Nxe6 {Now Haapala begins to gain material advantage. A hugely favourable position, two strong active knights, a queen deep behind enemy lines and rooks ready to pounce......it looks hopeless for me.} Rh5 31. Nf3 g5 {At this point I realised it was only a matter of time before I was put to the sword. I simply had to attack. My rook on H5 and strong knight on E4 needed some support. Looking at Happala's position only his knight defends his King, and the H3 pawn cannot leave its rank because of the rook pin on the King.......there was some hope.} 32. Qxd5 {Small material advantage gained by White, but more importantantly a nice discovered check!} Ndf6 33. Qb3 Qf7 {Blunder! but I survived.  Qf7 34. Rc7 Nd7 35. Ne5 Nxe5 36. dxe5 Nc5 37.

Nxg4 {However, I think Haapala was so confident in his position, merely exchanging knights would not stop his victory.  Blunder: -4.30 » 35. Nxg4 fxg4 36. f3 g3+ 37. Kg1 Re8 38. d5 Nf2 39.

Rxe8+ Kxe8 45. Nxf5    } fxg4 {Opens up my Queen to the F file and now the combination of rook, knight and queen look threatening.} 36. Rc7 {Fatal error! removing the rooks defence on F2 pawn! Mate in 3!! unstoppable!   Blunder: +Mate(3) » 36. Rc7 Rxh3+ 37. gxh3 Qxf2+ 38. Kh1 Ng3# Best: -5.05 » 36. f3 Re8 37. fxg4 Rh4 38. d5 h5 39. gxh5 Qxh5 40. d6 g4 41. Nf4+ Qf7 42.

I wanted to share this game because not matter how bad your position looks, if you have strong pieces on the board, there is always a chance!}
