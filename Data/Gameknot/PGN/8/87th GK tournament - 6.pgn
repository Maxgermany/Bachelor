1. e4 {white blundered a couple of pawns in the opening and allowed severe restriction on his queen's wing, that resulted in advantageous exchanges for black that converted in to a won endgame, B+2N vs 2N} c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. c3 Bg7 4. Bc4 d6 5. h3 Nf6 6. d3 {it's a bad placement for the d pawn, in this kind of structures both the d and the b pawn can rapidly became week and be captured} O-O 7. O-O Nc6 8. a3 d5 {to open up the position, white's d pawn will be a liability latter, as it can be easily attacked} 9. exd5 Nxd5 {as played already in Nevednichy, V. - Ivanisevic, I; 16th Bora Kostic Memorial; Vrsac; Serbia; 2010; 0-1, white continued with Re1} 10. Nbd2 Nb6 {attacking both the bishop and the pawn, I expect Bb5} 11. Ba2 {?!} Qxd3 {and the mentioned pawn falls} 12. Bb3 Bf5 {to avoid Bc2} 13. Re1 c4 {more space and some more restriction on the bishop} 14. Re3 {?! forces the queen to back up, but weakens the back rank} Qd5 15. Bc2 Bxc2 16. Qxc2 Rad8 {the queen is in front of the rook but then the bishop is closed, so it's not possible for white to play Rd1, if Ne4, I'm able to exchange queens with Qd1+ Qxd1 forced, Rxd1+ and now is Re1 Rxe1 Nxe1 or I'll force it with Nd5 attacking the rook with the idea of Re2 Nf4 Re3 Nd3 wining a piece, so white must play Re1 and allow the exchange of rooks also} 17. b3 {? loses another pawn} cxb3 18. Qxb3 Qxb3 19. Nxb3 Rd1+ 20. Kh2 Nd5 21. Re1 Rxe1 {and another piece is exchanged, and I'll get another pawn also} 22. Nxe1 Bxc3 {a forced sequence and here is the pawn} 23. Bh6 {? Rb1 and black would have had to give up the exchange in to R+N vs B+2N endgame} Bxa1 {getting the exchange, if Bxf8, I'll save the bishop with Be5+} 24. Bxf8 {? still Nxa1 is better than the played move, as it enters a B+2N vs R+2N endgame... either way black should lose now} Be5+ {!} 25. g3 {f4 isn't better due to Nxf4 and a threat to a discovered check with an attack on the e1 knight, as an example of a possible sequence: Bh6 Nd3+ g3 Nxe1} Kxf8 {now I'll try to exchange as many pieces as possible...} 26. Nc5 Bd6 {I'll exchange pawn by pawn...} 27. Ned3 b6 {or better yet I'll win a pawn, and if Nd7+, I'll win a knight with Ke8 and now if Ne5? Nxe5 Nxe5 Bxe5} 28. Nd7+ Ke8 {and white will lose the knight... so he decided to resign}
