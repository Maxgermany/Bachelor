1. e4 {black bet on disrupting white's pawn structure, but ended up having his king in the centre unable to castle went on to exchange queens and restricting white's remaining pieces, until finally won an exchange and the game soon after} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Be2 Bg7 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. Nb3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 Nf6 9. Qd3 d5 {as was played in the game Zozulia, Anna (BEL) - Stojanovic, Mihajlo (SRB); Geneva (Switzerland); 2007; 0-1,  immediately getting rid off d6 in order to equalize the position} 10. Bh6 {N!?  and may be the best white has here, as exd5 lead to defeat in the referenced game, white's Bh6 doesn't allow black to castle, but loses a pawn in the process...} Nxe4 11. O-O f5 {gains space and allows Kf7 to connect my rooks and remove my king from behind the e7 pawn on a semi-open column} 12. f3 {force the knight back} Nf6 13. Kh1 {prophylactic removes the king from the open diagonal } Kf7 {also prophylactic removes the king from the centre while adding a defender to the knight and g6...} 14. c4 {although a nice strategical idea to exchange one of his doubled pawn for one of my centre pawns, it lacks preparation.} Ne5 {with tempo } 15. Qd4 Nxc4 16. Bxc4 dxc4 17. Qxc4+ Be6 {with tempo now black has equalized, all my pieces are well placed, my king is protected and I have a better pawn structure and one extra pawn} 18. Qb4 Qd6 {offers a poisoned pawn, as Qxb7 allows Rhb8 and white loses his queen} 19. Qh4 {add some pressure over the king but he is still well defended as all pieces and pawns in the king's wing have two defenders} Rad8 20. Bf4 {?} Qb4 {pinning the bishop, now I can try to exchange queens, maybe } 21. Rad1 Nh5 {and exchange queens we will do} 22. Bg5 Qxh4 {and I'll exchange queens, with the queens off the board, my advantage can now be better exploited...} 23. Bxh4 Rxd1 24. Rxd1 Rc8 {further exchanges, to enhance my advantage of one pawn and better structure, but now I have to be careful about exchanging in to a opposite coloured bishops endgame...} 25. Rd2 Nf6 {centralizing my knight, now that it had done it's job} 26. Bf2 b6 {protects my pawns and avoids Na5 or Nc5} 27. g3 Bd5 {blocks the d column with tempo by attacking f3} 28. Kg2 {forced} g5 {gains more space} 29. Nd4 g4 {leaves the f5 pawn hanging as Nxf5 gxf3+ K moves Ne4 forks bishop and rook} 30. Be3 e6 {to protect the f5 pawn I left hanging} 31. Nb5 {now I must be careful against Nd6 that forks my rook and king} gxf3+ {zwischenzug before defending against the threat Nd6, I'll check so white king must move and Nd6 is not possible in this move} 32. Kg1 {now the only check is f2?, so I need to defend against Nd6 with Ne4, or move either my king or my rook} Kg6 {now Nd6 leads to nothing} 33. Nxa7 Rc4 34. h3 {now black threats Ne4, so white opened a exit square for his rook, but he will lose the rook anyway to Rb4 threatening mate} Ne4 35. Rh2 Rb4 {threatens mate in 2} 36. Rf2 {both this and Rd2 will end in the same capture by the knight...} Nxf2 {I considered also Nxg3 to prevent Rf1 in case of Rb1+, but then white still had Kh2, and my knight would have had to move, Ne2, but loses the initiative} 37. Kxf2 Bb7 {trapping the knight} 38. g4 {? maybe to open some breathing room for the king} f4 {closing the hole, and now I'll attack the c pawn, either Rb2 or Rc4 depending on white's bishop placement...}
