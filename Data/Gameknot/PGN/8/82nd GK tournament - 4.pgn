[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {This is the Ruy Lopez and is my first time playing it on gameknot. I rarely play the Ruy Lopez as it's extremely sharp and there're often closed positions.} d6 {This is the steintz defense. The idea is to protect the e4 pawn and make way for the LSB.} 4. O-O {I have fast and easy development.} Bd7 {breaking the pin.} 5. d4 {c3 was probably better here so I could establish 2 strong pawns on e4 and d4} exd4 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 {7. Qxd4 leads to disaster here after Bxb5! Black has almost equalised here.} 7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 8. Qxd4 c5 {Rather dubious. Better here was Nf6, Ne7 or a6 which prepare O-O-O althought the A7 square is extremely weak.} 9. Qd3 Nf6 {The Queen is still nice and centralised which mean it's controlling more squares. Nf6 develops a piece and prepare to castle short.} 10. Nc3 {Developing moves. f4 might've been better here.} Be7 {Develops a piece, prepares to castle and breaks the pin on the e file. The bishops position resembles the Ruy Lopez closed.} 11. Re1 {Future pressure along the e file.} O-O {Finally castles and connects both rooks.} 12. Bg5 {Athough this pin isn't too effective, it's mainly designed to be a harassing move and provking pawn moves to create weaknessess.} h6 13. Bh4 {althought h6 doesn't create too many weaknessess, I would target the f pawn and the light square around the king are  extremely weak.} a6 {Preparing for a b5 minority attack and perhaps preventing Nb5.} 14. e5 {Since his pawns are extremely weak I target them to soften the pawn structure.} Ne8 {Material is won here no matter what. After Bxe7 Qxe7 Exd6 Iwould be a pawn up and a have a strong pawn on d6.} 15. Bxe7 Qxe7 16. exd6 Qxd6 {Qxd6?? This the the first BLUNDER of the game. The d6 Queen is only protected by one piece that is on the same file as my rook.} 17. Rxe8 {Getting rid of the defender. My queen is protected so capturing the queen would result in me being up a knight. If black were to play Rfxe8 or Raxe8 then the queen is mine.} Qxd3 18. Rxf8+ Rxf8 19. cxd3 b5 {Here I'm up a knight. Black is desperately trying to pawn storm my queenside. All hope is lost for black unless I take my rook off the back rank.} 20. Re1 {Claiming the only open file. The c and d files are semi open.} Rd8 21. Rd1 c4 22. dxc4 {Rather dubious. Exchanging in a losing position will result in an easier game.} Rxd1+ 23. Nxd1 bxc4 {This is won for me now. With Ne3 I gain a pawn.} 24. Nc3 {I missed Ne3.} a5 {Desperately charges his pawns one last time.} 25. f3 {Preparing for a g4 advance and making way for my king.} Kf8 26. Kf2 Ke7 27. Ke3 Kd6 28. Kd4 f5 29. Kxc4 Ke5 {His pawn storm is looking dangerous now so I use my knight as a defensive piece.} 30. Ne2 g5 {The pawn and knight work together really well. It builds a wall from d4-g4.} 31. Kb5 a4 32. Kxa4 g4 33. b4 {This is won for white. Black will never penetrate through my defense.} h5 34. b5 Kd6 35. Ka5 Kc7 36. Ka6 Kb8 37. b6 f4 38. Nxf4 gxf3 39. gxf3 h4 40. b7 h3 {Desperately tries to hold on and prevent the inevitable.} 41. Nxh3 Kc7 42. Ka7 {Here hs resigns appropriately. I'm up 4 pawns and a piece. I will soon be up a queen and it would be too easy. Black played fantastically and it was only 1 blunder that cost him the game.}
