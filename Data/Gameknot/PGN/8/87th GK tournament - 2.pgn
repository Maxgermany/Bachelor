1. Nf3 c5 { if e4 we have a Sicilian} 2. e4 d6 3. d4 Nf6 4. Nc3 cxd4 5. Nxd4 a6 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. f3 e6 8. g4 {white will pawn storm my king side...} h6 {getting some leverage on g5} 9. Qd2 b5 {and now counter-attacking on the queen side} 10. O-O-O b4 {again to get more space on the queen side} 11. Nce2 Qc7 {leaves the b pawn "en prise" because if white captures it allows me to open up the center with tempo and get two pawns for my pawn} 12. h4 d5 {and also counter-attacking on the center, now I expect Bf4 e5} 13. Bf4 {forcing my reply} e5 {to block the threat on my queen, so I can keep it on c7} 14. g5 {? this move was expectable after Bh2, but not now, my opponent must have mixed up is move order} hxg5 {forcing the retreat because if white captures the leaves the h2-b8 diagonal releasing the pin on e5 and thus losing the d4 knight} 15. Bh2 gxh4 {and I get two pawns advantage} 16. exd5 Nxd5 17. Kb1 Nd7b6 {my knights will support each other, without blocking the f pawn} 18. Nc1 Bd6 19. Ndb3 a5 {consolidation of the queen side} 20. Re1 Kf8 {and moving the king away from danger without a castle because I need the rook on the h column and the queen side is to much open, next I may need to play g6 to open an escape route for the king} 21. f4 {?! sacrifices a pawn, white pieces can all be pointed at my king but does it worth three pawns? Does he have time for it? More so with white's king also vulnerable} Nxf4 22. Bxf4 exf4 23. Nd4 Bd7 {to counter on Nb5} 24. Nb5 Bxb5 {for seconds I even considered Nc4 but it loses to the immediate Bxc4 Qxc4 Qxd6+} 25. Bxb5 {now e8 is a bit weak so I need that g6 square} g6 26. Qd4 Rh5 {to prepare the blockade on e5...}
