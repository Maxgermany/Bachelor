1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Bd6 {This is a dubious defense but I can't find an immedite refutation.} 4. O-O Nf6 5. Re1 a6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d4 Bg4 8. h3 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 Qd7 10.

Na5 Rg6 20. Nc6 Qd7 21. Kh1 Rc8 22. Qf5 Qxf5 23. exf5 Rg5 24. f4 {Much better here was b5. I didn't even realise that I had given up a pawn.} Rxf5 25. Rad1 Rxf4 {ANd there goes another.} 26. Kg1 e4 27. Ref1 Kd7 28. Rde1 f5 29. Rxf4 Bxf4 30. g4 Bd2 31. Re2 Bc3 32. gxf5 Kd6 33. Kf2 Re8 34. Na5 Re5 35. Nc4+ Kxd5 36. Nxe5 Kxe5 37. f6 Bd4+ 38. Kg3 e3 39. Kg4 Kxf6 40.

Kg6 Bc7 52. h6 Kd3 {Better was to keep the rook on the e file to prevent the bishop to mvoe to e5.} 53. Rg2 c2 54. Rg1 Be5 55. h7 Kd2 {I resigned here because it is easily won for black. He can give up the bishop for me pawn and then he could play c1.  If I try to check him once he gets his king to b1 the game is lost.}
