1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Qe7 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 Qxe4+ 6. Be2 Bf5 7. c3 Be7 8. O-O O-O {Black's queen has a disadvantageous place, which white hopes to explore. } 9. Bg5 Nc6 10. Nbd2 Qe6 11. Re1 Qd7 12. a3 {12.a3 not a good choice loosing a tempo. 12.Bb5 was much better } h6 13. Bh4 Qd8 14. Nf1 Re8 15. Bb5 a6 16. Ba4 b5 17. Bc2 Bxc2 18. Qxc2 d5 {18..d5 both tries to get e4 square and opens a place for bishop. Almost equal game. } 19. a4 {19.a4? wants to open a-line, but it was wrong. It failed to achieve its aim, and remained a weak pawn at a4. 19.Re2 was also wrong due to 19..Ne4. 19.N3d2 may be a good one.} b4 20. Re2 bxc3 21. bxc3 Qd7 22. Rae1 Kh8 23. h3 Ne4 24. Nf1d2 {better than 24.Bxe7} Bxh4 25. Nxh4 f5 {this critical move changes structure of the game giving white a chance to place its knight on e5.} 26. f4 Nxd2 27. Qxd2 Re4 28. Ng6+ Kh7 29. Ne5 Nxe5 30. dxe5 Rxa4 {? 30..c6 was better preventing 31.e6} 31. e6 Qc6 32. Re2e5 Re4 33. Re1xe4 dxe4 34. e7 Re8 {White has to struggle for equal game.} 35. Qd8 {Now, black has not much choice. } g6 36. Kh2 Kg7 37. Re6 {? This move looses.  Nc5! was better. } Rxd8 38. Rxc6 Re8 39. Rxc7 {Now, 39..e3 wins, because after 40.Kg1 Kf7 41.Ra7 Rxe7 42.Rxe7 Kxe7, black has a far-passed pawn. } Kf7 {however, black looses his chance} 40. Ra7 Rxe7 41. Rxa6 e3 42. Ra1 e2 43. Re1 g5 44. fxg5 hxg5 45. Kg1 Rc7 46. Rxe2 Rxc3 47. Rf2 Kf6 48. Kh2 Ke5 49. Ra2 Rc7 50. Ra3 Ke4 51. Kg3 Rc4 52. Rb3 Rd4 53. Ra3 Rd2 54. Ra4+ Ke5 55. Ra5+ Kf6 56. Ra6+ Ke5 57. Ra5+ Ke4 58. Ra4+ Ke5 59.
