1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 6. h3 O-O 7. d3 h6 {Book through here.} 8. Be3 Bb6 9. a4 Bxe3 {The simpler I can make the game, the better my chances. So any and all exchanges are welcome.} 10. fxe3 Be6 11. b3 Bxc4 {Trading off the other set of Bishops.} 12. bxc4 Nb4 13. Rb1 a5 {Supporting my lone advanced piece.} 14. d4 b6 15. dxe5 dxe5 {Opening a file to get rid of some of the heavy artillery.} 16. Rb2 Qxd1 17. Rxd1 Rad8 {The Queens are gone and now I threaten to swap off a pair of Rooks.} 18. Rxd8 Rxd8 19. Nxe5 Rd2 {White is temporarily up a Pawn, but it's  doubled and isolated. Plus I now threaten to win it back.} 20. Nd5 Nfxd5 21. exd5 Rxc2 {I do win it back and threaten to remove the last pair of Rooks as well. But White has undoubled his Pawns as compensation.} 22. Rxc2 Nxc2 23. Kf2 f6 {Now the ending is simple enough that I should be able to hold my own. And material is even.

Kxe4 Kc5 35. Kf4 Kb4 {A Queening "race" will shortly begin.} 36. Kxg4 Kxa4 37. Kf5 Kb3 {And they're off!} 38. g4 a4 39. g5 a3 {If i foolishly play 39... PxP? I lose a tempo in the race.} 40. g6 a2 41. g7 a1=Q {It's a tie! The ending remains level.} 42. g8=Q Qf1+ 43. Ke6 Qxc4 {Technically, I'm now ahead one Pawn. But with an open board....} 44. Qg6 c6 45. Qb1+ Ka4 {Draw agreed. }
