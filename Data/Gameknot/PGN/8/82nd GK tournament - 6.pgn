[Opening "Sicilian (B33), Pelikan (Lasker/Sveshnikov) variation"]

1. e4 c5 {As usual, black fights back with a Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The trouble with this variation is it leaves white with a rather weak center.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. f4 {An unusual attack here, and not a terribly useful one. It leaves the e4 pawn unsupported.} Qc7 8. Qf3 Bb4 9. Bd2 d6 10. f5 {This pawn is a bit of a sticking point, but it never turns into more than an annoyance.} O-O 11. Bd3 Qb6 12. a3 Bc5 13. Na4 Qc7 14. Nxc5 dxc5 {Black is now set with the task of exchanging one of his doubled pawns for a non-doubled white pawn.} 15. O-O Qb6 16. b3 {This is the threat that needs to be defended. If 16. ... c4+ 17. Be3 Qmoves 18. bxc4.} Ba6 {Forcing a trade of a relatively bad bishop for a good one.} 17. Bxa6 Qxa6 18. Qc3 {? e4 is the key to this position, and needs to be defended.} Nxe4 {! If 19. Qxe5 Nxd2 and worse to follow. This capture has also given black the passed pawn that will eventually win the game.} 19. Qe3 Nxd2 20. Qxd2 f6 {Risky, as it exposes the black king to attack along the a2-g8 diagonal, but the e5 pawn needs support.} 21. Qd6 Qb6 {Those doubled pawns still need protection. The threatened Qe6+ is of no significant consequence, whereas the black's threat of c4+ allows black to trade off one of his doubled pawns.} 22. Qe6+ Kh8 23. Kh1 Rad8 24. Rad1 Rxd1 25. Rxd1 Rd8 {Black's queen makes this move possible, and forces white off of the d file. Black is now trying to take advantage of white's back rank while protecting his own.} 26. Re1 Qa5 27. Rf1 Qxa3 {And black has managed to trade off a doubled pawn.} 28. Qxc6 Qb4 29. Qc7 {! Definitely the right attacking move here.} Qb6 {! Defends d8, a7, and c5 all at once. White has to run or trade.} 30. Qe7 a5 31. h3 h5 {Correcting black's back rank weakness, but more aggressively than white's. This becomes important shortly.} 32. Rf3 h4 {To prevent an immediate Rg3 followed by attacks on g7.} 33. Qf7 Rd1+ 34. Kh2 Qd6 {Offering draw by perpetual check, if white chooses to take it.} 35. Qh5+ Kg8 36. Qxh4 {? White is better off with the draw.} e4+ {! This is the most difficult step this pawn has to take towards victory.} 37. Rg3 {The two alternatives, Rf4 and Qf4, leave white hard-pressed to stop the e-pawn. For instance, 37. Qf4 Qxf4 38. Rxf4 Rd4 39. Rf1 e3 40. Re1 Re4 and white is nearly out of options.} Qe5 {Otherwise, e3 is met by Qe4.} 38. Qg4 Rd7 39. Kg1 e3 40. Qc4+ Kf8 {Not Kh8, which would allow perpetual check. Not Rf7, which gives up too much mobility.} 41. Rf3 e2 {White has no way to stop the pawn from doing serious damage: (A) 42. Kf2? e1=Q# (B) 42. Rf1 exf1 0-1 (C) 42. Qxe2 Qxe2 0-1 (E) 42. Qb5 Rd1+ (E1) 43. Kf2 e1=Q# (E2) 43. Rf1 Rxf1# (F) 42. Qf4 e1=Q+ 43. Kh2 Qxf4 44. Rxf4 e1=Q+ 45. Kh2 Qe5 0-1}
