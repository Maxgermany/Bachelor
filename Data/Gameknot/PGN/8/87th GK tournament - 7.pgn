1. e4 {white produced an interesting novelty, I just disagree with playing g3 weakening the king's win pawns and then playing the bishop to b5... but Bb5+ was nice to avoid the main lines after the exchange of pawns at d4, then Be3 was dubious, to say the least, allowing me to harm white's pawn structure, also 15.Nf4 might have been better for white, this being said several inaccuracies sealed the fate of white's game, and allowed some basic tactics to add small advantages, the game ended soon after being simplified to Q + 2 extra paws vs R endgame} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. g3 Nf6 4. Nc3 g6 5. d4 cxd4 6. Bb5+ {N! interesting novelty, a zwischenzug leaving the knight hanging, Nxd4 would transpose to (B70) Dragon, fianchetto variation} Bd7 {I preferred to force the exchange of bishops instead of moving the knight to d7, because then it wasn't forced and I would like to have the chance of playing Ne5 at some point} 7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {places the queen on the open light diagonals a4-e8 and c8-h3 as there are no light squared bishops to contest her position in the same diagonal as the king} 8. Nxd4 Nc6 {inviting white to exchange knights after which I would have a nice pawn centre} 9. Be3 {?!} Ng4 {threatening to double white's pawns in the e column} 10. Qd2 Bg7 {again threatening to double pawns on the e column} 11. a3 Nxe3 {with the idea Ne5-Rc8-Rc4-Rxd4-Nf3+} 12. fxe3 {! Qxe3 loses a piece} Ne5 {blocks the e pawns defends the f7 pawn and dreams about Nf3+} 13. Qe2 Rc8 {the first instinct says I must play a6 to prevent either Qb5 and Ncb5, but I dont like the hole it creates on b6... then my second instinct says Rc8 is more offensive, and a6 can be played at a latter opportunity if needed} 14. Nd5 e6 {forces the knight to decide were to go, king's wing or queens wing?} 15. Nb4 {to play Nd3 maybe?} O-O {for safety} 16. b3 a5 {with tempo, but leaves a hole on b5} 17. Nd3 {expected, as white's main idea after 15.Nb4} Nc6 {again inviting the exchange, or I'll get a pawn} 18. Rc1 Nxd4 19. exd4 Bxd4 {and now I'm a pawn up} 20. Rf1 {?} a4 {to disrupt white's pawn structure} 21. b4 {?} Rc3 {aimed at a3, my c3 rook can not be moved away from c3 easily now} 22. Ra1 {?? blunder as it loses the knight to a discovered attack on the a1 rook} Rxd3 {now Qxd3 or cxd3 and I have Bxa1 -+} 23. Qxd3 Bxa1 {recapturing the rook with a knight up} 24. c3 {!? interesting but I can defend my bishop by attacking c3 with the rook then in the next move I can capture the pawn either with my bishop or the c8 rook} Rc8 {threatens Bxc3+} 25. Kd2 {again creative play by white, defends the pawn and threatens the bishop} Rxc3 {but I'm not afraid to exchange R+B by queen, so now if Rxa1 I have Rxd3 or if Qxc3 I have Bxc3} 26. Qxc3 Bxc3+ 27. Kxc3 Qb5 {and now I can infiltrate white's field with my queen to force the promotion of one of my pawns, the game should end soon} 28. Re1 Qe5+ {the idea is to play d5 or Qb2}
