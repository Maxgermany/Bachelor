1. c4 {This is from a rather short game, I would be interested in any comments.  As white I have been doing some experimenting with the English opening with varying degrees of success} e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. Nf3 Nc6 {This is the first time I have been able to attempt the pawn fork ploy and as you will see it all went to plan} 4. Nxe5 Nxe5 5. d4 Bxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6 7. Qe4+ {I wanted to see what black would do here, I was expecting Qe7 } Nge7 {I have my doubts about this move as black as it seems to block him in, although he can castle, what then? } 8. Bg5 {I liked this move as it develops with tempo and if black castles I still have his knight pinned and am threatening Nd5 to pressure the e7 knight more} O-O 9. e3 {Allows me to develop my lsb} Re8 {I was expecting d6 here which would allow black to develop his lsb or even f6} 10. Bd3 {Black looks rather cramped to me he seems to be looking for a queen exchange but this move threatens Qxh7 which looks nasty for black} g6 {I'm not clear what other options black had here - if any} 11. Qh4 {I was trying to work out how to break open the pawns around the black king, this looked like a reasonable start, combined with aiming to get my knight to f6} h5 {I'm not sure that this was necessary, maybe black panicked as now I have the option of g4} 12. Nd5 {Heading for f6 and coincidentally threatening the black knight} Nf5 {I was still expecting something like d6} 13. Bxf5 {Black resigned.   Thanks for reading please comment}
