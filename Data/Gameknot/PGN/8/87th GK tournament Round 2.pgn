1. Nf3 {Starting white, my habitual "testing the water" Nf3.} d5 2. d4 Bf5 3. e3 Nc6 4. Bd3 {No real surprise here.} Be4 5. Nc3 Nf6 {Would the better move for a knight been Nb4? Nf6 here I think is conservative and has both defensive and offensive value nevertheless.} 6. Ng5 {Not a smart move on retrospect. Obviously an invitation to exchange pieces and also to disrupt my castling option.} Bxd3 7. Qxd3 h6 8. Nf3 e6 9. a3 Bd6 10. O-O O-O {Rather early but safe-bet castling.} 11. b4 a6 12. e4 {Trying to provoke another piece-exchanging opportunity.} Re8 13. e5 Ng4 14. exd6 {Didn't end well for black...} Qxd6 15. h3 Nf6 16. b5 {I like my attacking motif so far.} Ne7 17. a4 a5 {This move may have holding off the progression of my knight to b5 in my mind...} 18. Ba3 {...but did not stop my pursuit of the black queen.} Qd7 19. Ne5 Qd8 20. Bxe7 Qxe7 21. f4 b6 22. Rae1 Qd6 23. f5 {Maybe this advancement is the logical one but would I have better thing to do at this stage on hindsight?} Rad8 24. fxe6 {Questionable move in an attempt to weaken the control of the mid-field.} Rxe6 25. Nc6 Rde8 26. Re5 Nd7 27. Rxd5 Re6e3 {The point where all hell break loose!!} 28. Rxd6 Rxd3 29. Rxd7 Rxc3 30. Rxc7 Rxc2 31. Rfxf7 Ree2 32. Rfxg7+ Kf8 33. Rgf7+ Ke8 34. Rfg7 Kf8 35. Rg6 h5 {Didn't see this move more than merely to escape being consumed, but it did give me an idea to also use my pawn to achieve the ultimate glory...} 36. d5 h4 37. d6 Rc1+ 38. Kh2 Ree1 {So, being checkmated in one move? Wrong, think again!} 39. Rf6+ Ke8 {Kg8 means definitely losing the rook on c1 and giving the pawn on d6 a chance to turn into something nasty...and so Ke8. And so the bang to follow.} 40. d7# {}
