1. d4 {I had the white pieces and I started with d4.} f5 2. h3 Nf6 {My opponent played knight to f6 and we have Dutch defence.} 3. g4 {Pawn to g4; Korchnoi gambit, uncomon and gimmicky but effective response to the Dutch defense, named after GM Victor Korchnoi, word has it that he'd crush anyone who dared opposing him with a Dutch defence...} d6 {d6; my opponent shows no interest for my gambit.} 4. g5 {g5, kicking the knight} Ng8 {back to g8, for going anywhere else would allow me to devellope with even more tempo on the knight.} 5. Bg2 {Bishop to g2, occupying the long diagonal.} e5 {e5, challenging my centre and indirectly my queen.} 6. dxe5 dxe5 7. Qxd8+ {Challenge accepted; queenless middle-game.} Kxd8 8. Nc3 c6 9. Nf3 Bd6 10. Be3 Ne7 11. O-O {I considered castling queen's side, but found it unwise because that was where he had his material momentum.} Be6 12. Rfd1 {Seizing control of the open file.} Kc7 {Defending and unpinning the bishop.} 13. Nh4 {The knight is not awfully well placed there, but it was either blocking the d-file or this, because I could feel e4 coming and so I clear the path for my f-pawn to meet that.} Nd7 14. Kf1 Nb6 15. b3 {b3, boxing out the knight.} Rad8 {Rook from a- to d8, contesting the d-file.} 16. a4 {a4, starting a pawn storm.} Ng6 {Knight to g6, challenging to loose knight, taking it would unleash his h-rook and make his king's side pawn structure far superior to mine, and since I can't defend it I couldn't help but retreat it.} 17. Nf3 Nd5 {Knight to d5, challenging my other knight, didn't really feel like defending it, nor like moving it to either of its two terrible refuge squares, so I chose to preserve my tempo to capture the unveiled a7 pawn.} 18. Nxd5+ Bxd5 19. Bxa7 Nf4 {Adding pressure on the king's side.} 20. a5 {Slowly proceeding my pawn storm, threatening bishop to b6, check; scewering his king to his rook.} Rda8 {Moving rook to safety.} 21. Bb6+ Kc8 22. c4 {c4, pushing him to trade his long diagonal bishop for my boxed out knight.} Bxf3 23. Bxf3 Be7 {Now look at this position; black retreats the bishop evading the rook and attacking the pawn on g5. But his king and a-rook are completely immobilized!} 24. h4 h6 {h6, trying to open files on the king's side, but he wouldn't succeed to wear down my rickety king's side defence.} 25. e3 Ng6 26. h5 {Small pawn-storm on the king's side; the best defence is the offence.} Nh4 27. gxh6 {Pawn takes h6?... Is this some sort of exchange sacrifice? Not exactly; if 27. ... Nxf3 28. hxg7 Rg8 29. h6 Ng5 and in this position black hasn't achieved anything: the g-file and h-file are still unpenetrable and although he just won a bishop for two pawns, his knight can't move because of h6 followed by imminent promotion to queen/rook and checkmate same goes for the g-rook. This would be especially undesirable, because his other pieces, save his bishop, are already imprisoned.} gxh6 {And so he wisely refrained from taking the bishop.} 28. Be2 Bd8 {Challenging my bishop, the guardian of his king and a-rook.} 29. c5 {Supporting my bishop.} Bxb6 30. cxb6 {And in the end of the day, what did he achieve?... His mighty king and rook are now being humiliated by two mere pawns.} Rd8 {Contesting the d-file in a last attempt to free His Majesty...} 31. Bc4 {Bishop to c4, now rook takes rook has no use anymore, because after 31. ... Rxd1+ 32. Rxd1 black can't play the liberating 32. ... Rxa5, because of 33. Be5+ Kb8 34. Rd8#} Re8 {So black played Rook to e8, defending e6. Now white made a move, and black resigned...} 32. Rd6 {Rook to d6, threatening 33. Rad1 ... 34. Be6+ Rxe6 35. Rd8#. and there was little black could do about it; a possible continuation could've been:} Nf3 33. Rad1 Ng5 {The knight is now defending e6, so that the rook can keep defending d8.} 34. f4 {Kicking the knight.} exf4 {Delaying the inevitable.} 35. exf4 Rxa5 {Knight musn't move to prevent checkmate.} 36. fxg5 {Off goes the knight.} Rd5 {And black has to sacrifice a rook to remove the bishop.} 37. Bxd5 cxd5 38. Rxh6 {And we can stop here; white has avoided a quick defeat, but harbors little hope for victory. And that's it for now, what do you think about this game? Feel free to leave a comment and goodbye for now.}
