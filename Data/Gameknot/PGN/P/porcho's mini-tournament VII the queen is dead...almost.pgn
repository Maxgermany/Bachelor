1. e4 {Had to annotate this one though my skills for annotation aren't the best my other annotation was more for humor than value but this was an interesting game in a mini tournament.  I recovered and won after blundering a great opportunity early on to get the queen. I welcome all comments. } e5 {Book so far but I prefer queen's pawn open} 2. h4 {I thought this was an odd move but computer gave it +.4} Nf6 {I thought my move was book I got +.34?} 3. Qf3 {Computer said this was an innacuracy.} Bc5 4. a4 {Again I think the rook pawn is odd at this stage} d6 5. Bc4 O-O 6. d3 Ng4 {Threatens Nf2 fork} 7. Nh3 {He deals with it.} Nf6 {I moved back for homeland security computer called it a mistake -loss of tempo I suppose.} 8. c3 Nbd7 9. Qg3 {He got an Inaccuracy here.} Nh5 {I begin my attack on the Queen} 10. Qg5 {He offers Queens gambit} Ndf6 {Considered it but had another notion.} 11. Nd2 {Computer said this was a Blunder the first of the game but not the last and I would make some of my own.  b4 was best according to game computer} h6 {Having calculated all his possible Queen moves and feeling confident I boldly declared: "The Queen is dead" } 12. Bxf7+ {but I forgot about his Bishop!} Kh8 {I got my first Blunder and I think it should be called an Uber Blunder ugggggg.  Shanehill my opponent correctly pointed out I could have got the queen by taking the Bishop with my King!!! But I was focused on taking it with the Rook and how that failed because it gave him g6 to go to so I got flustered and moved the king argghhh (picture charlie brown when lucy takes the football away)} 13. Qg6 {And there he goes } Qe7 {Now the computer called this a mistake but it was key to my recovery} 14. Bb3 {He also got a mistake but he saved the queen and killed a pawn} Nf4 {I got a blunder here but it was a calculated move.} 15. Nxf4 {takes bait} exf4 {Road closed} 16. d4 {uh oh ..um can I get two moves please?} Ng4 {closing in} 17. e5 Bf5 {The renewed attack} 18. Qh5 {Only escape} g6 {Now the Queen is truly dead time for a funeral and....} 19. Qxh6+ Nxh6 {burial. now about that king of yours} 20. h5 dxe5 {I should have saved the bishop here.} 21. O-O {Blunder for him he should have killed the Bishop.} exd4 22. cxd4 Bxd4 23. Nc4 {Blunder Nf3 was best.} Qe2 {I get my own Blunder I think its #3 but I disagree with that this leads to mate} 24. Bxf4 Ng4 {Tightening the noose} 25. Rae1 {Oo scary but easily dealt with by a forcing move} Bxf2+ 26. Rxf2 Qxf2+ {Mate in...} 27. Kh1 Qxe1# {two.  I was focused on the queen kill in this one by missing the opportunity but it lead to an easy endgame.}
