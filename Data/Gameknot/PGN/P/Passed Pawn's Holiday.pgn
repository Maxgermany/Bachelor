1. d4 {[%clk 0:15:09] the Queens pawn. My favorite opening  to play. I excel in one specific line which my opponents somehow fell for it again and again.} d5 {[%clk 0:15:08] } 2. c4 {[%clk 0:15:18] } dxc4 {[%clk 0:15:14] } 3. e4 {[%clk 0:15:23] } e5 {[%clk 0:15:14] There you go from here on I am 90% sure my opponent will go for d5 to avoid Queen exchange.} 4. d5 {[%clk 0:15:18] } b5 {[%clk 0:15:19] protecting c4 and prompting Nc3 to attack b4} 5. a4 {[%clk 0:14:40] Oh no Oh no. Unfortunately that is UNEPECTED MOVE. I am out of my book. My home cooked line is 5.Nc3 Nf6 6.Nxb4 Nxe4 7. Bxc4 Nxf2! 8.Kxf2 Qh4+ 9.g3 Qxc4 and white is set for a BAD game But now I am on my own. Time is already ticking. } Nf6 {[%clk 0:13:52] Just continuing the old trick hoping it would bring same result.} 6. Bg5 {[%clk 0:14:02] Things already feeling different game than I used to in this line} Bb4+ {[%clk 0:13:47] } 7. Nc3 {[%clk 0:13:54] } h6 {[%clk 0:13:14] I hate pins} 8. Bxf6 {[%clk 0:13:59] } Qxf6 {[%clk 0:13:16] } 9. axb5 {[%clk 0:13:52] I am dropping pawns and where is my compensation.} Bc5 {[%clk 0:12:56] Anybody needs MATE in ONE?} 10. Nf3 {[%clk 0:13:10] No} Qb6 {[%clk 0:12:27] I hated this move  1. The threat can easily be defended and 2. The queen is in a cramped place} 11. Qc2 {[%clk 0:12:01] } Nd7 {[%clk 0:09:52] I love this move though and engine agrees to Now Na4 can be met by Qa5+ so I will not lose to NxB  but not for long after white o-o Queen got to go. } 12. Bxc4 {[%clk 0:11:42] pawns are falling .I am a pawn down} O-O {[%clk 0:09:52] } 13. O-O {[%clk 0:11:37] } Qd6 {[%clk 0:08:39] Time for queen to go but Is that the best square?  I dont know . I thought Qg6 was better more free space.} 14. Ra2 {[%clk 0:10:02] Now I feel my a7 pawn is in danger after Rfa1 doubling } Bb6 {[%clk 0:07:43] Unnecessary move I feel Bb7  better address my fear} 15. Na4 {[%clk 0:09:05] } Bb7 {[%clk 0:07:09] } 16. Rfa1 {[%clk 0:08:00] What did I say?} Nc5 {[%clk 0:05:13] Just to free my cramped position} 17. Nxc5 {[%clk 0:076:56] I thought Nb6 was more forceful} Bxc5 {[%clk 0:04:58] No Qxc5 for Ne5 drops a pawn} 18. Qc3 {[%clk 0:07:21] } Bb6 {[%clk 0:04:48] Mistake number 1  I dropped e5 pawn for simple overlooking 19. Qe5 } 19. Qxe5 {[%clk 0:06:25] 2 pawns down question is can I save the game?} Qc5 {[%clk 0:04:42] simple  trick } 20. b3 {[%clk 0:06:16] Solves the trick } Rae8 {[%clk 0:04:37] } 21. Qf4 {[%clk 0:06:02] } Bc8 {[%clk 0:03:39] that bishop was there for defending the rook  now it is no longer needed to defend so i try to realigne it to more useful lines} 22. Rd1 {[%clk 0:03:56] The doubled rooks are threatening nothing as a7 is well guarded by the bishop which should have been taken by the knight  on move 17} Qe7 {[%clk 0:02:49] } 23. Re2 {[%clk 0:03:23] } Qd6 {[%clk 0:01:49] Under time pressure, and also I could not c any concrete play for a draw} 24. Qxd6 {[%clk 0:03:28] I thought the queen exchange speed up my draw options and so does agree the engine} cxd6 {[%clk 0:01:57] I smell Draw signs even if i am 2 pawns down 1. Many things are blocked  2. Opposite bishops 3. Whits isolated double pawn  } 25. h3 {[%clk 0:03:00] I think e5 was better } f6 {[%clk 0:01:56] blocking e5} 26. Nh4 {[%clk 0:02:52] Ng6 looks bad for me} g5 {[%clk 0:00:55] } 27. Nf5 {[%clk 0:02:53] Ng6 would have trapped the knight} Bxf5 {[%clk 0:00:47] Now I am beginning to get belief about the draw } 28. exf5 {[%clk 0:03:03] } Rxe2 {[%clk 0:00:39] } 29. Bxe2 {[%clk 0:03:13] } Re8 {[%clk 0:00:48] } 30. Bc4 {[%clk 0:03:11] } h5 {[%clk 0:00:38] to stop g4} 31. g4 {[%clk 0:03:03] } hxg4 {[%clk 0:00:43] } 32. hxg4 {[%clk 0:03:12] beware g4 cant be defended right away by g-pawn} Re4 {[%clk 0:00:47] } 33. Kf1 {[%clk 0:02:52] } Rxg4 {[%clk 0:00:41] } 34. Re1 {[%clk 0:03:00] } Kf7 {[%clk 0:00:39] blocking any counter playof  R on e7} 35. Re6 {[%clk 0:02:58] } Bc5 {[%clk 0:00:30] } 36. Ke2 {[%clk 0:02:37] } Rf4 {[%clk 0:00:31] one more pawn restores material equality and rewards my tenacious play } 37. f3 {[%clk 0:02:40] } Rxf5 {[%clk 0:00:33] Now i am eve dreaming better than draw for me} 38. Re4 {[%clk 0:02:12] } Re5 {[%clk 0:00:26] } 39. Kd3 {[%clk 0:01:53] } Rxe4 {[%clk 0:00:18] } 40. Kxe4 {[%clk 0:02:02] } Kg6 {[%clk 0:00:24] To win here is difficult but I believe I have guaranteed the draw} 41. Be2 {[%clk 0:01:40] } f5+ {[%clk 0:00:30] } 42. Kd3 {[%clk 0:01:48] } g4 {[%clk 0:00:21] Mistake number 2 Well not what is this move?  another unforced error drops a pawn but still I think is solid draw} 43. fxg4 {[%clk 0:01:56] } f4 {[%clk 0:00:25] They say passed pawn is dangerous than exchanging it But I am already in time trouble I should have elected t simple game by fxg4 } 44. Ke4 {[%clk 0:01:50] } Kg5 {[%clk 0:00:33] } 45. Bf3 {[%clk 0:01:56] } Be3 {[%clk 0:00:30] just look whit king can not cross into my territory  I still feel I am controlling the game in a draw position} 46. Kd3 {[%clk 0:02:04] It will take a lot of walking if u want to get to my pawns white king so I focus on promoting  my c-pawn as whit bishop can be chased away by my King} Kh4 {[%clk 0:00:28] } 47. Kc4 {[%clk 0:01:58] He did not budge as well the race to queen is officially ON} Kg3 {[%clk 0:00:36] Mistake Number 4 Passed Pawns Holiday  } 48. g5 {[%clk 0:02:06] I overlooked the strength of this move I was thinking I will stop it by my bishop } Kxf3 {[%clk 0:00:33] I c that the g-pawn is the runaway queen as my bishop can not stop it So I decided to c if I have any chance left over} 49. g6 {[%clk 0:02:15] True Horror watching this pawn fly to the queening square without any opposition} Ke2 {[%clk 0:00:31] giving way for my late f-pawn} 50. g7 {[%clk 0:02:23] one square to go but mine is 3 q´´square to go I feel cold. } f3 {[%clk 0:00:40] } 51. g8=Q {[%clk 0:02:31] Already a queen. How can I guard my pawn to queen with just a king and bishop} f2 {[%clk 0:00:49] The reason why I decided to annotate this game I feel glimmer of hope FANTASTICALLY according to the engine this position is a dead draw. White queen can not simply prevent the queening of my pawn  But I had to be Sharp precise } 52. Qg2 {[%clk 0:01:38] } Ke1 {[%clk 0:00:51] Game Over Last chance and ONLY MOVE TO SAVE GAME was Bd2. It was hard for me to understand why even after the game  But close inspection I see that It got to do with the resulting position in the king pawns end game His king on d2 and my king on f1 is draw But his king on e3 and my king on f1 is LOST} 53. Kd3 {[%clk 0:01:30] } Bb6 {[%clk 0:00:53] even 53....f1Q 54. QxQ Kxf1 Kxe3 would lose for reason I stated earlier.} 54. Qe4+ {[%clk 0:01:26] I lost but It was a beautiful and lively game. I believe the errors in the game add beauty to the game. I would love to hear your comments.}
