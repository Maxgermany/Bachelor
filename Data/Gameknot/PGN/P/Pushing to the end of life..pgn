1. f4 {The Birds.} d5 {Standard response.} 2. d4 {Not to bad. I'd say Nf3 to get piece's out.} Nc6 {Blocks the c-pawn. Maybe Nf6 via g6 and castle quickly.} 3. e3 Nf6 {Developing.} 4. c3 {The "Stonewall"} Bg4 {Developing. Maybe not best. Maybe Bf5?} 5. Be2 {? Bad move! If black takes, then white would have one Bishop. And that would be a BAD BISHOP. (The one on c1) The e2-Bishop is whites best.} h5 {? Why open up the side unless needed?} 6. h3 {? Best was to game Nf3 and save the LSB.} Bxe2 {! Great!} 7. Nxe2 e6 8. a4 {? What?} Ne4 9. h4 {? Opening up squares for black to take advantage of.} Bd6 10. Nd2 Nxd2 {?! I don't really think that the exchange was needed.} 11. Qxd2 Qe7 12. Qc2 O-O-O {An okay move.} 13. b4 {Attacking on the queenside. Expected.} a5 {? Why open up your king?} 14. b5 Nb8 15. g3 {Why is white still pushing just pawns?} Rdg8 {I guess planning for f6; g5?} 16. Rf1 f5 {?! Well, I thought wrong!} 17. Rb1 {Planning b6, maybe?} g5 {? This just losses a pawn! That's why f6 THEN this was better!} 18. fxg5 Bxg3+ {?? What??? Black just lost a bishop for what? A pawn??} 19. Nxg3 Rgf8 20. c4 Qd6 21. Rf3 Nd7 {All I can say is: Black's in trouble!} 22. Ra1 c5 23. Ba3 b6 24. Rd1 f4 {Attacking.} 25. Nf1 fxe3 26. Rxf8+ Rxf8 27. Bb2 {Now white's not attacking. He should attack. Not do nothing as it looks like he's going to do.} Rf2 28. Nxe3 {?! Do you think that that was necessary?} Rxc2 29. Nxc2 {Okay. Black's not in to bad of shape--now.} Qg3+ 30. Kd2 dxc4 31. Re1 {I think black should win this now, don't you?} Qf2+ 32. Re2 Qf4+ 33. Kd1 Nf8 {?! Hmmm... Why this? Why not Qxh4 or cxd4?} 34. Re5 Qg4+ 35. Kd2 Qf4+ 36. Kd1 {What? A draw?} Kd7 37. dxc5 Qf3+ 38. Kc1 bxc5 {Hmm, c3 looks good, don't you think?} 39. Re3 Qh1+ 40. Re1 Qxh4 {Yum yum!} 41. Rd1+ Kc7 42. Be5+ Kc8 43. Rg1 Ng6 {! Good! The knight is always the best piece to put infront of a pawn!} 44. Bf6 Qf4+ 45. Kb1 Qf2 46. Re1 Kb7 {? This just lost a pawn! Best, if you wanted the king to move, Kd7.} 47. Rxe6 Qf5 48. Re2 Qd3 {I believe that black needs to push his h-pawn.} 49. Re3 Qd1+ 50. Kb2 h4 {Great!} 51. Be7 Qd4+ {?? Whoops! That had to hurt!} 52. Nxd4 {I don't think I need to annotate the rest?} cxd4 53. Re4 h3 54. Bd6 d3 55. Rxc4 d2 56. Rd4 {A very nice game, until the end. If black kept his cool, he might have won! Please comment and rate it on the star system. Thanks!}
