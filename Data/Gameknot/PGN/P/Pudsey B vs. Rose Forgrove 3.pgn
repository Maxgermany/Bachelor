1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 {I'm always happy to see 2.c4 as it allows me to play a Black Knight's Tango, which I very rarely get to play. Shame really as I seem to beat everyone with it. I more frequently see 2.Nf3 where I am forced to go into a more direct KID setup. Alternative variation: 2. Nf3 [The Tango doesn't work in these kinds of positions as white simply has] Nc6 3. d5 [when black can't go] [due to the Knight on f3.] Ne5 } Nc6 3. Nf3 {This could be considered as a refutation of the Tango, which was one of the reasons why I started to study the KID as an alternative however, white didn't continue with the correct/ best line, after 3.Nf3. We'll discuss this in a moment. Alternative variation: [This is my favourite version of the Tango as it allows an immediate e5.] 3. Nc3 [when after] e5 4. d5 Ne7 5. e4 Ng6 6. Nf3 a5 7. Bd3 Bc5 [we reach a kind of "Accelerated King's Indian Defence", where the KID Bishop appears to be more active, operating along the g1-a7 diagonal.] } e6 {I have to change my plan slightly as 3...e5 isn't playable here. I now want to develop the dark squared bishop outside of the pawn chain, then engineer a c7-d6-e5 pawn skeleton then exchange on c3 at the correct moment. That way I will end up with a good Bishop and the two Knights, in a potentially closed position. } 4. e3 {I was happy to see this, rather than 4.a3, black's going to build a nice position now. Alternative variation: [The only way to refute the Tango is by playing] 4. a3 [Black can now no longer develop the dark squared Bishop naturally and so has to opt for a slower King's Indian Defence with] g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. e4 d6 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O e5 [The closed nature of the position means that black's loss of tempo isn't a bad thing. You could also argue that 4.a3 balances it out a little. Either way, black is doing fine here.] } Bb4+ {Getting on with the plan as described earlier. } 5. Nc3 O-O {Alternative variation: [I suppose you could try] 5... Bxc3+ [but after ] 6. bxc3 [I'm not confident that white's pawn complex is all that bad. I would sooner exchange on c3 after white has forced me to.] } 6. Qc2 d6 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. Qxc3 {So now the position is getting closer to the one I had calculated. I just need to prepare the e5 break to challenge the centre and then I'm happy. } Qe7 9. Qc2 {Wasn't sure if this was necessary but it makes my life easier as I can now challenge the centre and gain some space on the kingside. } e5 10. d5 Nb8 {This may look bad at first but due to the closed nature of the position, black can afford a few extra tempi in re-routing his Knight to a stronger square. As pawn formations change, new plans need to be formulated. The original idea behind ...Nc6 was to take the route Nc6-e7-g6 but as this was prevented, the Knight will now be most effective on c5. After taking all of this into consideration, ...Nb8 is the best move! } 11. e4 {Black's not the only one using extra tempi, it's taken two moves to develop white's pawn to e4. } a5 {A standard move in these positions. Creating an artificial support point on c5 for the Knight. I first read about this in Nimzowitsch's book called My System. By taking control of b4 you're indirectly supporting the c5 square for a minor piece. White will then have to try and bolster the b4 square with moves like Rb1, if he's ever going to shift a Knight from c5. My plan here is simply to kill off any play that white may have on the queenside by re-routing my Queen's Knight to c5 and advancing the a-pawn to a4, if white allows this then I think black will be close to winning.  } 12. Be2 {Alternative variation: [Obviously white can't play this immediately as after] 12. b4 axb4 [ the Rook will be hanging on a1 if white recaptures.] } Nbd7 {It's no secret where this little guy's heading. } 13. Bg5 {I feel as though white doesn't have a plan at this stage so I'm just going about my plan of killing off any queenside play, then I will turn my attention to the kingside. } Nc5 14. O-O a4 {I'm often reluctant to play a move like this due to the vulnerability of the flank pawn after being cut off from his brothers however, the pro's outweigh the cons as white is now unable to play b4 and get any play generated on the queenside. Alternative variation: 14... Re8 [I looked at this line but as it was only based on the following "cheapo", I opted against it. I thought after a later ...f5 break, the Rook will be better placed on f8.] 15. Rab1 Ncxe4 16. Qxe4 Nxe4 17. Bxe7 [when black is a pawn up. All white needed to do though was overprotect e4 and black's Rook is misplaced. I chose correctly and avoided a 'what if' scenario.] Rxe7 } 15. Nd2 {Clearly planning an f4 break here due to having everything neutralised everywhere else (due to my accurate play) however, white has no right to play on the kingside. I feel as though any pawn advances on this wing will only benefit black. } h6 {I now need to remove the pin on f6, drop the Knight back to h7 and break with ...f5 and activate the rest of my pieces. My focus is now white's King. } 16. Be3 b6 {I wasn't expecting white to capture on c5 but just in case he did, I was preparing to recapture with my b-pawn. I need to keep the centre completely closed to that white has no tactics in the centre, when I attack on the kingside. Alternative variation: [If instead I ignore white's "threat" and play on the kingside] 16... Nh7 17. Bxc5 [gives up the good bishop and after] dxc5 18. Nb1 f5 [Black's pawns just look a little disjointed and I wasn't happy about the position. Instead I opted for some prophylaxis before continuing with my plan.] } 17. Bxc5 {I was surprised to see this as I thought white would want to keep his good bishop on the board. I feel as though black is just increasing the value of his position as the game goes on. } bxc5 {Although the a-pawn is now isolated, he's a hero as he's still holding up the queenside on his own and he will be brave enough to sacrifice himself as a means to distract white from the action in more critical areas of the board. } 18. f4 {White has no right to expand on this side of the board. This will not be the beginnings of his downfall and it won't be long until black gains a decisive advantage. You should never be able to attack on the side of the board where you are worse. I feel that white is only doing this as a last resort, merely because black killed off any play everywhere else on the board. } exf4 {I can simply capture here then make use of the newly created e5 outpost and play for a later f5 break, when everything becomes active and white will be reduced to passivity. } 19. Rxf4 Nd7 {Probably not the best move but I wanted the Knight to sit on e5. Better was probably Alternative variation: 19... Qe5 20. Rf2 Rb8 [Using the weak dark squares and sacrificing the little guy on a4 for a very dominating position.] } 20. Rf2 Ne5 {This is where I thought the Knight was best placed, and actually, in this game it was! } 21. Nf3 {?? Blunder, although white was always going to be struggling here so I feel as though the pressure of being outplayed paid a huge part in this mistake. The game is still far from over and requires a lot of accurate play yet. Alternative variation: [If instead] 21. Raf1 Rb8 22. h3 Qg5 [Black is still enjoying a superior position, but he's not winning just yet.] } Ng4 {Eyeing up the e3 square, white loses the exchange by force. } 22. Bd3 Nxf2 23. Qxf2 f5 {Now I need to open the e and f files, in order to activate my advantage in Rooks. } 24. Re1 {The x-ray attack doesn't concern me here, black is absolutely winning here and is in full control of the position. } fxe4 25. Bxe4 Qf6 {Pinning the Knight on f3. } 26. Qd2 {Side-stepping the pin and potentially threatening to penetrate via a5, if the a8 Rook ever decided to leave the a-file. } Bg4 {Realising that the Knight is the superior minor piece so I was considering exchanging the Bishop for the Knight here. White's Bishop is passive so to force a Rook vs. Bishop endgame seemed like an ideal scenario for black. } 27. Kh1 Qf4 {Increasing pressure and hoping to exchange Queens. Alternative variation: [I probably should just stick to my guns here and play] 27... Bxf3 28. gxf3 Rab8 [Using the dark squares once more. The line I played was also good enough for the win.] } 28. Qc2 {Obviously white doesn't want to exchange Queens and ensures that everything is defended sufficiently. } Bf5 {Then I had a change of heart and decided to force the exchange of Bishops instead. It doesn't make a huge amount of difference, black's winning ether way. } 29. Bxf5 Qxf5 30. Qd1 {Although I would have preferred the Queen's to come off, I was happy with this as it's just passive. I also notice that white's keeping an eye on the a-pawn, which gives me options to use the a-pawn as a decoy in order to force a mating net on the opposite flank. } Rae8 {Part of the plan, trying to tempt to Queen with some free food on the queenside, after which I will storm through in the centre and on the kingside. } 31. h3 {Preventing a back rank mate but this doesn't ensure white's king safety, as we shall soon see. Alternative variation: 31. Qxa4 Rxe1+ 32. Nxe1 (32. Ng1 Rxg1+ 33. Kxg1 Qf1#) 32... Qf1# Alternative variation: 31. Rxe8 Rxe8 32. Qxa4 Re1+ } Rxe1+ 32. Qxe1 Qd7 {Keeping all entry points closed off. } 33. Qd1 Re8 34. Qd3 Qe7 35. Qc2 Qe2 {And again, the vulnerability of white's king can be seen. If white takes on a4 now he's getting mated again. } 36. Qg6 {I hadn't even looked at this possibility, it's not a saving move by any means but I wasn't expecting it. I spent most of my time just calculating the wins after Qxa4. Alternative variation: 36. Qxa4 Qf1+ 37. Kh2 [Which was all calculated over the board, now I'd seen] Re2 38. Nh4 [but then just] Qf4+ 39. Kg1 Re1# [Wins. So I always knew that the a-pawn was never hanging but unfortunately, so did my opponent.] } Qe4 {Simple double attack, swap Queens or c4 drops. } 37. Qg3 {Of course white doesn't want to exchange Queens but that decision will come at a cost. White's centre is about to crumble and I'm about to create a passer. There probably was a quicker win for black but it's never easy to finish a game when low on time and after 9pm, I was just happy to be making progress and improving my position. } Qxc4 38. Nh4 {I'm not worried about white's Knight and Queen here, they can't mate me so I just continue to eat pawns. } Qxd5 39. Qg4 {What's this, going after that a-pawn again, are we? } Qe4 40. Qd7 Re7 {All of my pieces are coordinated, everything is defended  and I'm the exchange and two pawns up. White can resign now, I feel. } 41. Qd8+ {There's never going to be any mating nets here. } Kh7 42. Nf3 d5 {I decided that it was time to just get the passed pawn rolling. With 2 minutes on the clock (to my 14), white decided that he'd now had enough and resigned. He said that as his team were 4-0 already, he should have resigned sooner. I disagreed and said he had every right to play on as at times black may not have appeared to be making enough progress however, it's clear I was winning at this stage. Great game and very instructive, but could this be the last time I play the Black Knight's Tango? We will see... }
