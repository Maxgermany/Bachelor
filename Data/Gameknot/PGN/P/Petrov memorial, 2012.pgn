[Opening "French (C11), Steinitz, Bradford attack"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {French defence.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {French classical system. 3...Bb4 would lead to the Winawer/Nimzowitsch variation.} 4. e5 Nfd7 5. Nce2 c5 {Black has equalized the opening.} 6. c3 Nc6 7. Nf3 Qa5 {(probably expecting 8. Bd2 when 8...Qb6 leads to the normal position with attack on b2 and d4 squares) A developing move like 7...Be7 was better.} 8. a3 cxd4 9. b4 Qc7 10. cxd4 b5 11. Bd2 Qb6 {Too many queen moves by Black. It now blocks the b6 square from the knight on d7 and also moves away from the open c-file. 11...Nb6 was better when the knight heads for the c4 outpost.} 12. Rb1 Be7 13. Bc3 {White over-protects d4 and allows Black to launch a queen side attack with 13...a5} f6 {This routine move opens the king side and allows White to launch a vicious attack} 14. Nf4 fxe5 15. dxe5 Nf8 16. Nd4 {White's pieces are aggressively placed. So Black tries to exchange pieces to weaken the attack} Nxd4 17. Bxd4 Qb7 {White's pieces are becoming more active with every move and Black is being driven back whose pieces are mostly on the back rank.} 18. Bd3 g6 19. O-O Bd7 20. Qg4 a5 {This pawn thrust by Black is 7 moves late!!} 21. Rfc1 {White has activated all his pieces and look at Black's pieces.  21. Nh5 gxh5 22. Qg7 and black's rook is lost.} axb4 22. axb4 Ra4 23. Bc5 {23. Nh5 is still in the air} Bxc5 24. Rxc5 Qb6 25. Rcc1 {25. Nxg6! looks promising} Qd4 26. Qg5 Rxb4 27. Nxg6 {At last the knight is sacrificed which opens the king side} hxg6 28. Bxg6+ Nxg6 29. Qxg6+ Kf8 30. Qf6+ Kg8 31. Qd8+ Kf7 32. Qxd7+ {Black resigns. Mate follows.}
