1. e4 {Time control was two hours each, though I started half an hour down on the clock due to flooding here.   Interestingly, when I arrived, my board (5) was already being played on!   So was 6 - I (as captain) had sent the team through while en route, but the early players missed this and played to the team as it had been the day before!   In the meantime, one game had been postponed and board order had changed.   I couldn't play on 7 due to ratings gaps, so a quick rejig saw board 6 - ten moves in - re-designated as board 7, while their board 7 was bumped up to 6 to play me with colours reversed.   The fun of being a captain!} c5 {The Sicilian.   I've put the game into Fritz as I've posted it here, so its thoughts are noted as we go.   But of course Fritz can't really take the time to explain its rationale, particularly in positional positions - which is where I'm hoping the gameknot community can come in!} 2. c3 {The c3 Sicilian.} d5 {I'm more comfortable with the 2. ... Nf6 line, but I'm getting used to this, which is more common these days.} 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. d4 e6 {After a couple of standard book moves, this is an inaccuracy I think.   Nf6 or Nc6 are the main moves.   Fritz doesn't like 4. ... e6 - but of course the question is what to do about it.} 5. Nf3 cxd4 {This also helps me, giving me the c3 square for my knight.   More common is to leave the tension and try force white's knight to a3 or d2 instead.} 6. cxd4 Nf6 7. Nc3 Qd8 {So for the next while, the d-pawn is free to advance.   But for the next few moves, I try to set up the standard IQP threats - a bishop to c4, a knight to e5, rooks into the centre, the queen to d3.   It seems a bit early yet for an attack given I'm hardly developed.} 8. Bc4 {So I start with this, easing the threat of Nd5, blockading the pawn.} Nc6 {Seems logical.   I need to keep a future Na5 in mind if it means taking my LSB off the a2-g8 diagonal.   For now, it's not a threat though.} 9. O-O {After 9. d5, black swaps off lots - 9. d5 ed 10. NxP NxN 11. BxN - and the position looks quite dull.   So - more pieces into the game.} Be7 10. Re1 {A good square for the rook.   e7 can be a focal point for tactics later if I can get in Ne5 and Nxf7.   But that's a long way away; for now, I think this is just the best square for the rook.} O-O {Logical} 11. a3 {Now I wanted to keep my bishop on the current diagonal, so this was played against Na5.   But maybe this is over cautious?   Fritz gives it as a very slight inaccuracy, giving 11. Bf4 as about 0.2 better.} Bd7 12. Bf4 {Fritz's number one pick, with the threat of Nb5 to be considered.} a6 {So he defends against it} 13. Qd3 {Fritz prefers Rc1 or the d5 break here, but not by much.   I hadn't yet considered d5, as after 13. ... ed 14. NxP NxN 15. BxN, I didn't see what I had.   But Fritz says black has nothing better then than 15. ... Be6, allowing 16. BxN PxB, when black has some pawn weaknesses.   I would have thought the d5 push should achieve more than this though?} Rc8 14. Rad1 {Both rooks are now optimally placed, but the d5 break is becoming more favoured - white seems to have an initiative advantage.   I didn't like how much freer black's position - particularly the bishops - becomes though.} b5 15. Ba2 {The bishop can hop between a2 and b1 as needs be.} Na5 16. Ne5 {Stopping the knight coming into c4, and taking advantage of e5 now being available.   But again Fritz calls for 16. d5 - yet as it plays through the analysis, it becomes less enamoured with the move.   So is it time for the move yet?   There don't seem to be any material-winning tactics as yet.} Nc6 {A bit of a concession} 17. Bb1 {The knight is immune from capture (17. ... NxN?? 18. PxN and black can't save the knight on f6 and prevent mate on h7), and I'm aiming to force a weakness on the kingside.} g6 {There we go.    It's something at least.   Maybe at a future stage, a h4-h5 push could help crack black open some more.   Obviously the knight on f6 would need to be addressed.  I had a vague idea of a plan along the lines of h4, Re3, Rh3, h5 and saccing the exchange to open the king.   I don't know how effective that would have been though.   And it doesn't fit in with my next move.} 18. Ba2 {I've played reasonably well so far (says Fritz), but this throws away all my advantage.   I wanted to bring the bishop back to the same diagonal as the king, as the g6 move seemed to have blunted its scope too much on b1.   But I've missed 18. ... b4 19. ab NxB and my LSB is taken off the board.   So instead, Fritz wants to bring more pieces towards the king - Bh6 or Qf3.   Though I'm starting to get a little bit frustrated at the lack of decisive action; maybe I just need more patience!} Nxe5 {My opponent misses his chance, and I have a big advantage now.   This move is a shame - it seems that black has thrown away the game.   So I'm trying to go back over my previous moves to see where I could have improved.   If the play was ok (as Fritz thinks it roughly is, 18. Bb2 aside), what were my routes to victory?} 19. dxe5 {The f6 knight now must get kicked to an awkward square - and it also needs to protect the d7 bishop.} Nd5 {I was a bit surprised at this move - it came quickly, and I hadn't really analysed PxN fully; it had to be good - but Fritz gives it as the best, though it drops a pawn.} 20. Nxd5 exd5 21. Bxd5 {Pawn in the bag.   But now what?} Be6 22. Bh6 {Looking to avoid giving black the open f-file after I swap bishops} Re8 {Forced} 23. Bxe6 {23. ... QxQ isn't an option in light of the zwischenzug 24. BxP+, and I'm two pawns up.   So I get to keep the queens on, which has to help me.} fxe6 {So this is forced} 24. Qh3 {And I hit the weak pawn.   I was unsure between this and 24. Qb3; I figured on this one as it was closer the king.   Fritz slightly prefers 24. Qb3, I guess to help cover a future intrusion on c2.} Qb6 {Forced to cover the pawn (and save the queen, of course).} 25. Be3 {Redeploying with tempo} Bc5 {And an unfortunate blunder which ends the game almost instantly.   25. ... Qc6 was forced, when black is still fighting.   I had settled on 26. Qg4 as a reply, with the idea of pushing h4-h5.} 26. Rd7 {Mate is threatened} Re7 {Desperation} 27. Rxe7 {Resignation.   The queen must fall to avoid mate.   After putting the game through Fritz, it seems I played better than I thought (18. Ba2 aside) - but it didn't seem to me like many of the standard IQP plans really came into play.   Happy to hear suggestions from others on how to improve my play!   The IQP is common in the c3 Sicilian and other lines I play (like the Panov-Botvinnik against the Caro-Kann) - I could always do with improvement!}
