[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C65), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 {This quick game was an unexpected win against a player ranked 300+ points above me. I often play a defensive game against players ranked much higher than me, but this time, I went on the offense.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Usually I do a Ruy-Lopez opening, but this time I tried a variation of it.} Nf6 4. Nc3 Bd6 5. d3 {Move pawn up to free up the dark square bishop so it can pin the knight on the f6 square.} O-O 6. Ba4 a6 7. O-O b5 8. Bb3 {Move bishop to safety and where it can pin the f7 pawn.} Bc5 9. Bg5 {Pinned the black knight, hoping to go after it with my knight on c3, and then disrupt the black king's castle.} Be7 10. a3 h6 11. Bxf6 {I could respond to the h6 pawn move by either pulling the bishop back to h4, or by exchanging the bishop for a knight. I go for the exchange.} Bxf6 12. Nd5 Ne7 {By interposing the knight between the black queen and bishop, the only piece protecting that bishop is the pawn in front of the king. This works towards my tactic of disrupting the kingside pawns.} 13. Nxf6+ gxf6 {Now black has two unprotected pawns near his king, and the third pawn is pinned by the bishop.} 14. Nh4 Ng6 15. Nf5 {Move knight up to where it can threaten the unprotected h6 pawn.} d6 16. Qh5 {Move queen into the arena. At this point, I don't think black can save the h6 pawn. Moving the king to h7 is suicide. Moving the knight to f4 threatens the white queen for just one half move, and the game ends shortly after that. So black's best move is to take the knight.} Bxf5 17. exf5 {And the pawn takes the bishop and threatens the knight.} Ne7 {The white queen could either stay put and protect the f5 pawn from the knight, or it can clear up the area around the black king by taking the h6 pawn. It is better to take the h6 pawn because even if black takes the unprotected f5 pawn, the queen might get the knight as a prize in return.} 18. Qxh6 Nxf5 {Black takes the pawn as expected ...} 19. Qg6+ {And the queen moves to threaten both king and unprotected knight. The queen is safe from the f7 pawn because it is pinned by the b3 bishop. If black moves the king, white gets the knight as a prize.} Ng7 {Only safe move for black.} 20. Rfe1 {Get rook ready to move to the h column.} Qd7 {This move protects both the f7 pawn and allows the black queen to move to the kingside quickly. Black could have blocked the white bishop with the d-pawn followed by another pawn to c6 one move later to support the d-pawn. That would relieve the pressure on the f7 pawn, and allow it to take the queen on g6. If black moved the d pawn this move instead, I would have moved my queen to h6.} 21. Re3 {But the rook can move to the h column quickly anyway. (I should have moved the rook to e4 instead where it can then move to h4 without being threatened by the black queen.) Black resigned at this point.}
