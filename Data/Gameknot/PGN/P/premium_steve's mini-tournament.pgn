1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nf3 {This was the initial position of the tournament - NCO gives 3...Bg4 as the best move here. My opponent has something different in his mind.} Nc6 4. d4 Nb4 {!? A start of a cheapo attack - in which I unforgivingly fall.} 5. c4 {? This is really a bad move. I have no excuses here - I have to get rid of this kind of "forcing" play.} Qe4+ 6. Be2 Nc2+ {And black picks up the rook, take white's option to castle and so on. I have noticed that I have lost many games against some weirdo openings - and that tells me I lack understanding in the openings and/or am too confident to claim an advantage. This is something I need to take care of.} 7. Kf1 Nxa1 {And here we are - don't play too (half) fast in the opening!} 8. Nc3 {I might as well play on at least for a couple of moves - If I can develop harassing the queen and pick the cornered knight I just may achieve an almost playable position - an exchange down for some tempi or something.} Qc2 9. Qe1 {Obviously not Qxc2 Nxc2. And keeping the queens on board is essential if I want to succeed in muddying the waters.} Bg4 10. Nd5 {This knight is heading for b4 - re-gaining the control of the c2-square with tempo, since black has to take care of the threath of Nxc7 . I'm not interested in pawn formations any more, since I figured out that piece activity is the best hope I have here.} Bxf3 {This maybe isn't too bad but I think it would've been better to continue development. Doubled f-pawns is least of Whites worries here} 11. gxf3 {Bxf3 Qxc4 defends the c7-pawn.} Rc8 12. Nb4 Qf5 13. Bd3 {To clear the second rank for king and simultaneously improving a piece - A check on h3 is no problem as White wants to activate his queen and capture the a1 knight with his rook.} Qh3+ 14. Ke2 a5 {This seems to be somewhat slow as the knight is not needed here any more - the d3-bishop controls c2. But it is no big mistake since black can now play e6-with tempo.} 15. Nd5 e6 16. Nf4 {Once again - attacking the queen!} Qh4 17. Be3 {White completes his minor piece development. } Bd6 18. Qd2 {Now, incidentally, White is fully coordinated and can start thinking of the d5-thrust and some attacking - he has a huge lead in development. It seems certain that black should've played Nf6 when he had the time. Maybe at next move would still make the job but here black decides to open the c-file for his rook. This turns out to be not so clever choice.} c6 19. d5 {!?} cxd5 20. cxd5 Nc2 {A somewhat weird move probably planned to prevent a bishop invasion at b5. a4 is inferior square as it pins the f4-knight.} 21. Bxc2 exd5 22. Rc1 {threatening Ba4 } Bxf4 {? I think this only strenghtens the threat of Ba4 , since the white queen can now give a check at d5 in case of king coming to the d-file.} 23. Ba4+ {This is quite a strong in-between move, winning back the exchange.} Rc6 {forced} 24. Bxf4 {simply regaining material, the rook is not going to escape.} Qf6 {Yet another weird move. Centralizing the queen is generally a good idea - but why not to develop the knight?} 25. Qxd5 {!? This sacrifice should lead to draw, as I don't think White is justified for playing for a win. 25.Bxc6 bxc6  just seemed to leave me a pawn down with the black queen dominating the whole board - White would have to take care of the f4-bishop, weak b2 pawn etc. etc. and in the endgame whites pawn formation would be inferior. The idea is to check the black king into g5, play Qc5  and after ...f5 Rc4 forcing queen in the corner with ...Qxh2 (h5  would be lethal), play Rg4  and give perpetual with queen. So let's see how all this went in practise...} Qxf4 {Otherwise White would have just gained a pawn and Qxb2  Rc2 is not a problem.} 26. Bxc6+ bxc6 27. Qxc6+ Kf8 28. Qa8+ Ke7 29. Qb7+ {It is very important to gain the right position of queen and rook to check all the way up the board and get the option to play Rc4} Kf6 30. Rc6+ Kg5 31. Qb5+ f5 {31...Qf5?? 32.Rc5} 32. Rc4 Qxh2 {Centralising the queen (Qd6) would've allowed h5  followed by Qxf5  or a deadly pin (Rc6)} 33. Rg4+ Kf6 34. Qc6+ Kf7 35. Qd5+ Kf6 36. Qc6+ {And here I offered a draw. My opponent didn't accept it and thought that he could defend against Rxg7 . I had hardly looked at those variations, but it seemed to me that It would be very unwise to allow such an activity.} Ke7 {?} 37. Rxg7+ Kf8 38. Qc3 {This might still be drawn, but If somebody discovers that black was justified in declining the draw offer - please leave a comment!} Qh6 {The best.} 39. Rc7 {Threatening mate with Rb7?? would reboud after Qa6 !} Qf6 {Here I thought Qe6 , but this is equally good if not better. } 40. Qxa5 Qxb2+ 41. Kf1 Ne7 {Finally black develops his knight, after sitting silently for forty moves.} 42. Qa8+ {This manoeuvre wins the black knight.} Kf7 43. Qd5+ Kg6 {43..Kf6 44.Qd6  and 43...Kf8 44.Kd8 } 44. Rxe7 {Here I thought that if I can force mate or a king and pawn enging I would win - but I'm not so sure If I would win a rook or quuen endgame. I'm really not sure what the "correct" result of this position is. I have to ask it from my little German friend - Fritz.} Qc1+ 45. Re1 {45.Kg2 is impossible due ...Qg5 !} Qc7 46. Qd4 {Manoeuvring to kingside with tempo} Rd8 47. Qh4 {This is a nice square for the queen - If black does nothing, White will play Re7, f4 and Qg5 mate! It is not so easy to defend against these threats. White has additional, quicker threat of Re6  winning, in which black has to take care of - hence his next move} Qb6 48. Re7 Qa6+ 49. Kg2 h6 {? This is premature as it could be played after g5, too. Now White has a winning manoeuvre.} 50. Qg3+ Kh5 {50...Kf6 51.Qg7 checkmate!} 51. Rg7 {! Black is now losing.} Qf6 {51...Rd4 52.Qh3  Rh4 53.Qxf5 is a nice version of the epaulette mate.} 52. Qh3+ Qh4 53. Qxf5+ Qg5+ 54. Rxg5+ {And Black resigned. It is an amusing fact that  54...hxg5 55.f5 Rg8 56.Qh7  Kg4 57.f3  Kxf4 58. Qe4# is forced mate!  That queen and rook ending maybe looked easy, but it was actually very hard to play due many alternatives at every step. I'm quite proud of all those manoeuvres that I found - maybe discounting the 5.c4 manoeuvre!}
