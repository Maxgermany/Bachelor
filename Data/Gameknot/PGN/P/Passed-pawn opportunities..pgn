1. e4 e5 2. d4 {Center game.} exd4 3. c3 d3 {? Not the best.} 4. Bxd3 Bc5 5. Bf4 Qf6 6. Bg3 {A tactical retreat.} d6 {Protecting his c-pawn.} 7. Nf3 {Blocking any attack on f2 for good.} Nc6 8. Nbd2 {All of our pieces are focused towards the kingside.} Nh6 {Worthless.} 9. h3 {Blocking all potential moves for the knight except back...} Ne5 {Here is where things started to get crazy.} 10. Bxe5 {Maybe Nxe5?} dxe5 11. O-O Bd6 12. Qa4+ {I abandon my king and start my conquest.} Bd7 13. Qb3 Qg6 14. Qxb7 {Full marks for bravery, maybe not for smarts.} O-O 15. Kh1 {I get out of the pin. Kh2 didn't look appealing after Ng4+.} Rab8 16. Qxa7 Rxb2 {trading pawns...} 17. Qe3 {In a attack there is a time when you have to pull back and reorganize.} Rbb8 {? This wastes a tempo.} 18. a4 {I start pushing my passed pawn.} Qh5 {This would be deadly if it wasn't for...} 19. Nh2 {!! The ultimate defense. I am secure from all threats.} Be7 {What for?} 20. a5 {In my following turns whenever I get a tempo, I push the pawn.} Bg5 21. Qf3 {Notice how his queen is hanging and mine can be recaptured with my hanging knight.} Qg6 22. Nc4 {Or I could have sacrificed my knight and pushed the pawn. My bishop would be freed and it could chase down the rook.} Bf6 23. a6 Rba8 24. a7 {Finally.} Bc6 25. Rfe1 {?} Rfd8 26. Bc2 Bb5 27. Na3 {He can't take my pawn because of Nxb5 and then the rooks are traded.} Bc6 28. Nc4 Qg5 29. Na5 {I start to challenge the passed pawn attackers.} Bd7 30. Nb7 Rde8 {I was expecting Rb8.} 31. Bb3 {Aiming at f7.} Bc6 32. Bd5 Bxd5 {The only move. Letting the bishop live loses the rook on a8.} 33. exd5 Be7 34. Qe4 Bd6 35. Nf3 {I start my attack.} Qf6 36. Nxd6 cxd6 37. c4 {Threatening to undermine the d-pawn and then advancing the d-pawn.} Qe7 38. Qe3 f5 39. Rec1 Rec8 40. Qa3 Rc7 {My pawn is gone, but...} 41. Nxe5 {Looking back I am not sure if my sac is correct.} Rcxa7 {Oh boy!} 42. Nc6 {Ha!} Kf7 43. Nxe7 Ra7xa3 44. Rxa3 Rxa3 45. Nc8 {I start to clean up.} Ra6 46. c5 dxc5 47. Rxc5 g5 48. Rc7+ Ke8 {Can't move to the sixth rank thanks to a fork.} 49. Rxh7 g4 {Hoping for hxg4, Nxg4 followed by Ra1#} 50. d6 g3 51. d7+ {I push it with check before...} Kd8 52. fxg3 {This.} Rd6 {??} 53. Nxd6 {Black was lost anyway. He resigned.}
