1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {Philidor's Defense. C41} 3. d4 {Counter attack!} Bg4 {This is a weak move already.--Fischer} 4. dxe5 {Morphy takes anyway.} Bxf3 5. Qxf3 dxe5 6. Bc4 {attacking the weak f7 point.} Nf6 {Developing and blocking the queen.} 7. Qb3 {! still attacking the f7 and also b7!} Qe7 {f7 must be protected!} 8. Nc3 {Morphy does not grab the pawn, but continues to develop.} c6 {now the pawn is protected.} 9. Bg5 {Black is in what's like a zugzwang position here.  He can't  develop the [Queen's] knight because the pawn is hanging,  the bishop is blocked because of the Queen.--Fischer} b5 {Perhaps black can drive white back with the pawns?} 10. Nxb5 {Not Morphy!!! he sees all!!! Material is less than the attack!!} cxb5 11. Bxb5+ Nbd7 12. O-O-O {more pressure with the rook!} Rd8 {black defends with the rook!} 13. Rxd7 {Now an exchange sacrifice as well!!! Morphy sees that he can bring the other rook into the attack!!} Rxd7 14. Rd1 Qe6 {Black breaks the pin on the knight else the queen is dead meat!} 15. Bxd7+ {forking the queen and king} Nxd7 16. Qb8+ {And then the finish!!! A queen sacrifice!!!! the knight must take!} Nxb8 17. Rd8# {Bam!!! the last two pieces in Morphy's camp give mate!!!  This is one of my favorite games, My heart quickens whenever I play vs a philidore that I may repeat this game.}
