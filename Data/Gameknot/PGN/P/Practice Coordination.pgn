[Opening "Latvian counter-gambit (C40)"]

1. e4 {This is another practice game, in which I play the dubious Latvian Gambit and take some risks to open up an attack against a disorganized White position. The theme of this game is piece coordination and planning--Black has a very clear plan throughout the game, whereas White does not, and the differences in the solidity of their resulting midgame positions are substantial as a result. Enjoy!} e5 2. Nf3 f5 {?! The Latvian. As soon as Black makes this move, he knows his general game plan: (A) break up the White center, then (B) create activity in the center and on the kingside. This move in particular also shows that Black is willing to sacrifice material for that activity. } 3. d3 {For all the reasons I don't think White should decline the Gambit in such a passive way like this, see my Latvian Gambit series. 3.Nxe5, 3.Bc4, 3.exf5 or 3.d4 are all stronger for White, but this move crops up quite often, especially if White doesn't know the opening well. The problem is that it is simply too passive, and lets Black get virtually everything he wants--space and time. We know Black's game plan--what is White's? This move suggests he wants to play a more positional game, keeping some tension in the center rather than tearing into a kingside attack.} Nc6 {This is essentially a waiting move, with the benefit of holding onto e5 without blocking in the DSB by playing ...d6. If possible, Black wants to play d7-d5 at once, in keeping with his plan to create space and play energetically in the center.} 4. c3 {This move seems to prepare White to play d3-d4, but why? 3.d4 was absolutely playable (last turn), and this move denies White the natural spot for his Queen's Knight, after already committing to the d2-d3 move. Already White's moves feel like they lack cohesion.} Nf6 5. Bg5 {I don't like this move very much--Black can easily play 5...h6, and either drive the Bishop back to e3 with a gain of tempo, exchange White's good Bishop for a Knight, or win a piece for two pawns if 6.Bh4? White's e4 pawn was threatened, but a better way to deal with it would have been 5.exf5.} h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 7. Nbd2 d5 {This is probably a mistake, as it loses a pawn to 8.exd5 Ne7 9.Nc4! Nxd5 10.Nxe5 and allows White to improve his LSB's outlook by enabling d3-d4 soon, but Black needs to get his own LSB into play, and remember, he is willing to sacrifice material for activity. The text breaks up White's center, which is one of Black's goals.} 8. exd5 Ne7 9. c4 {White attempts to hold on to d5, though this move weakens d4 permanently and now there's little hope of freeing White's LSB anytime soon. As I mentioned above, 9.Nc4 was probably stronger.} c6 {Seeking to re-exert more control over the center with ...cxd5 or else take a look towards d4 after 10.dxc6 Nxc6.} 10. dxc6 {10.Be2 might have been cleaner, as the White King still lingers dangerously in the center of the board as the position opens.} Nxc6 11. a3 {White needs to develop, not push pawns--this move seems intended to prevent ...Nb4 with a threat on d3, but it needlessly weakens b3 and more importantly does not contribute at all to White's development. A queenside pawn storm is not really feasible without pieces to support it. Black has been working steadily towards his goal: control the center and develop his pieces to active locations, while White's plans are unclear.} Bd6 {White seems unlikely to castle queenside with his pawns so disorderly and no pieces to support them, so Black is thinking ahead to tactics against a kingside castle. As a result, d6 seems like a prime spot for this Bishop, rather than c5, since h2 will remain weak when White castles, but f2 will be well-defended.} 12. Be2 O-O {Black, with most of his development complete and his pieces occupying comfortable posts in and around the center, is clearly preparing to make his push through the center and kingside. White's pieces, on the other hand, have little in common except that they seem awfully cramped, and don't threaten much of anything. In other words, Black's pieces are coordinated and active, while White's are disorderly and passive. Black's midgame plans are clear--what are White's goals?} 13. Qb3 {This is a good thought, threatening to push to c5 with check. White has a queenside majority, so seeking to activate it is a good line of thinking. The only problem with this particular move is that it blocks the b-pawn from advancing, and it somewhat marginalizes the WQ. A better post might have been c2.} Kh8 {Black wants to avoid any interruptions along the a2-g8 diagonal once his attack begins. Note that 14.c5+ was not a critical threat, as 14...Be6 allows Black to save his DSB, but ...Be6 is not consistent with his kingside attack--Black wants that Bishop on b7 instead.} 14. O-O b6 15. Qa4 {Black is clearly preparing to fianchetto his LSB--this threat is a waste of time. 15.Rfe1 may have been better, or 15.Qc2.} Bb7 16. Qb3 {There was no reason to move the Queen here--she's no more active on b3 than she was on a4. All the while, Black's forces carefully set up in coordinated, strong positions from which to assault the White kingside. It also gives Black the opportunity to force White to respond to his next move...} Nd4 {Black begins his attack. Both Bishops aim at the White King, whereas White is in no position to make threats.} 17. Nxd4 exd4 18. Nf3 {White sees Black's impending attack, and begins to play inaccurately. Probably 18.Bf3, encouraging trades and activating White's bad Bishop, would be more effective here, but bringing the Knight to bear is certainly reasonable. White re-defends the vulnerable h2 pawn and blocks the LSB's diagonal.} g5 {This sort of aggressive play is possible because White cannot make any threats--even against a King as seemingly exposed as Black's is.} 19. Nd2 {?? Sure, this Knight will be driven away soon, but make Black actually do it--White had a free tempo to use here, and would have benefited from 19.Rfe1, freeing the King from his prison in the castle. Additionally, this move presents Black with a simple tactic to win material for nothing...} g4 {? ...Unfortunately, I missed that tactic in my rush to blast open the White castle. Best was 19...Qe5! where White must play 20.g3 to avoid mate on h2, allowing the BQ to scoop up White's Bishop for free.} 20. Qd1 {?? The thought behind this move is sound--White wants to bring his Queen back to the action. However, a preemptive 20.g3 would be better, as this move gives Black enough time to really load on the pressure.} Qh4 {There is actually a combination here that I missed at the time, which results in a more clearly won game for Black: 20...Bxh2+! 21.Kxh2 Qh4+ 22.Kg1 Bxg2! 23.Kxg2 Qh3+ 24.Kg1 Rg8, and now Black is threatening ...g3! and White must give up tremendous material to avoid mate on h2.} 21. Nf3 {?? This is the final mistake. As White had just pulled this Knight back, I assumed he intended to block this threat with 21.f4 first, as the followup is significantly less strong for Black after 21...gxf3 e.p. 22.Nxf3, with Black's g-pawn no longer a threat to the Knight and the WK with some more space to run. But now, White is finished.} gxf3 22. g3 Qh5 {0-1. White cannot avoid devastating material loss after 23.Bxf3 Bxf3, where the WQ must give her life for the Bishop (if she leaves the d1-h5 diagonal, she no longer threatens to capture Black's Bishop and therefore nothing can prevent 24...Qh3 followed by 25...Qg2#). White's lack of clear midgame goals resulted in his forces being hopelessly disorganized, without even any real interference from Black. This is why it's so very important to have clearly thought-out goals from the very start of the game--know where you're going and what your plans are, and know how each move you make contributes to that plan. Thanks to chicoboy for the game, and thanks for reading!}
