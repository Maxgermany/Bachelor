1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {The themed mini tournament started here.} 3. Qf3 {Hmm, I've never seen this before. I don't think it's terrible, but I'm not sure it's best.} Nf6 {Exchanging would allow him to develop a knight.} 4. Nc3 Qa5 {Now it's looking like a normal Scandinavian defense except that I have my knight out and he has his queen out.} 5. d3 {Preparing to move his bishop to d2.} e5 6. g3 {I expect he's planning to double up this queen and bishop.} Bb4 {I add another attacker} 7. Bd2 c6 {This is standard in the Scandinavian defense.} 8. Bh3 {?! I fell it wold be better for him to move it to g2.} Bxh3 9. Nxh3 {Well he has a slight lead in development, but he has light square weaknesses. I was feeling pretty good at this point.} Nbd7 10. a3 Bxc3 11. Bxc3 Qc5 {?! Better would have been c7.} 12. O-O O-O {?? Allows a skewer.} 13. Bb4 {!} Qd4 {I decide to look for an attack before he can make use of his rook.} 14. Bxf8 Rxf8 15. c3 Qc5 16. Ng5 b5 17. Ne4 Nxe4 {Somehow he manages to get an exchange.} 18. Qxe4 f6 {Better might have been f4.} 19. Rac1 g5 {I go for a pawn storm, I know it's a bad idea to make your king vulnerable, but since I'm lost anyhow I want to go out with a bang.} 20. b4 Qb6 21. h4 {Hey wait a minute-I was supposed to be attacking!} h5 {?????????????????????????????????????????????? This is what completely dooms me.} 22. Qg6+ {!} Kh8 23. Qxh5+ Kg8 24. hxg5 fxg5 25. Qxg5+ Kh8 {Look at the board, I have *no* pawn cover for my king, and oh joy he has an open file to shuttle his pieces down.} 26. Kg2 {Preparing to use the h file.} Nf6 {So that when he moved his rook to h1 it wouldn't be mate.} 27. Rfh1+ Nh7 28. Qxe5+ {I believe he executes his attack very well.} Kg8 29. Qe6+ {I don't know what this does.} Rf7 {???? Much better would have been Kg7.} 30. Qg6+ Rg7 31. Qe8+ Nf8 32. Rh8+ {!! A very strong sac} Kxh8 33. Qxf8+ Kh7 34. Rh1+ Kg6 35. Qd6+ Kf7 36. Qd7+ Kg6 37. Qe6+ Kg5 38. f4# {And he polishes my off. Well played stigb, good game. Please comment and rate.}
