1. c4 {Hey all! This is the second game from this terrific league match. This time, I hold the White pieces, and very quickly offer an ill-conceived sacrifice. I try to cover my tracks by throwing more material at the problem in a desperate bid to expose the Black King before I run out of forces. Enjoy!} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 {Very standard Anglo-Indian.} 3. e4 {Now we're veering toward a standard King's Indian with 3...Bg7 4.d4 d6.} Bg7 4. e5 {!? White avoids the classic King's Indian lines with this aggressive option. Black must accept the thorny pawn for now, but the question remains whether White can hold onto it so far afield.} Ng8 5. d4 e6 {More common are 5...c6 or 5...d6. The text makes f6 a dangerous hole just to allow ...Ne7; it's probably better to develop the Knight to f5 via h6 instead.} 6. Nf3 Ne7 7. Bg5 {Taking advantage of the weakened dark squares.} O-O 8. Qd2 d6 9. h4 {?! This is where, as White, I decided to make a big, unsound sacrifice, but really the choice isn't made until next move. With correct play from here, White should retain a solid, excellent position, though 9.O-O-O would have been smoother and much more comfortable. See my next note...} dxe5 {All right. Now, there are two lines that I see that look good for White. The first is the simple one; 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.dxe5 and once White castles he should be in good shape, though he'll still probably have a tough time holding the e-pawn. The other line is much sharper and rather unclear: 10.dxe5?!! Qxd2+ 11.Kxd2?! Nec6 (say) 12.Bf6 and White has far better development, offset by his awkwardly-centralized King. White should be able to pick up the d-file soon because of Black's queenside lack of development, and may be able to use his greater activity to transition into a strong endgame. While this isn't the way the game went, I'd be very interested to see how that line would have played out!} 10. Nxe5 {? Honestly, this is a mistake. The lines I gave above are simply better. The text loses a piece for a pawn in a wildly speculative attempt to break into the Black kingside.} f6 11. Nxg6 hxg6 {Taking the Bishop would have allowed White to open the h-file for his Rook.} 12. Be3 Nf5 13. Bd3 Nc6 {Piling up on the d-pawn.} 14. g4 {?! The d-pawn is pretty much indefensible, so White goes on the offensive instead, forcing Black to take with the f-Knight rather than the c-Knight.} Nfxd4 15. O-O-O {15.Bxg6 was a strong consideration, but the Bishop seems likely to get trapped back there, and might even give Black an excuse to free his own LSB (via a trade on f5). Instead, White accepts the loss of a pawn to activate his other Rook and get his King to a somewhat safer spot.} f5 {Locking one White Bishop out while allowing the other one in--I think I like 15...e5 better (although considering how much trouble this pawn caused me down the road...)} 16. h5 Kf7 {16...Ne7 was definitely worth a look. The problem is that now after 17.hxg6+, Black really ought not to recapture with the King, as the g-file can open any second and White has sacrificed material to get another Rook ready to occupy it.} 17. hxg6+ Kxg6 {? This has got to be a mistake, though even here I don't see a forced conclusion, or even a decisive combination, for White.} 18. gxf5+ exf5 19. Rdg1+ Kf7 20. Rh7 {Forcing Black to pull some pieces back to defend. Notice how strong White looks despite being a full piece behind. As long as White can remain the aggressor, he has a chance to regain equilibrium with his activity advantage.} Rg8 21. Be2 {I thought for a long time on this move. White's problems are the pawns on c4 and f5, preventing this Bishop from getting into the action. His other thorn is the nasty Nd4, ready to leap into action with a killer fork on f3 if given the chance and bottling up White's pieces with its mere presence. I'm loathe to exchange while a full piece behind, this move is the best option I found for White--if Black leaves the Bishop alone, White can renew his attack with a check on h5. If Black takes it, the Knight is gone and the Queen will move to a much more useful location on e2. Essentially, this is throwing another piece at the problem to hope it goes away, but at least it's a relatively weak piece compared to Black's strong Knight.} Nxe2+ {This is a natural move, and exchanging while ahead is generally good, and Black certainly wants to avoid giving this Bishop a line to his King, but I think this gives up too much. 21...Be6 or simple 21...Kf8 were both worth a look in my opinion.} 22. Qxe2 Ne5 {? This feels like a perfectly reasonable, rational move, but in fact this inaccuracy tosses the game, or at least lets White recover with advantage. I think the correct play was 22...Ne7, instead (or perhaps the more daring 22...Nd4?!). The critical factor is White's Bishop, prepared to jump to either g5 or c5 at a moment's notice, so that after 23.Qh5+, Black's only response must be 23...Ke6, whereupon White can pick up at least the Bishop at his leisure. Other King moves all lose instantly to the powerful White Bishop: 23...Kf6 or 23...Ke7 are met with 24.Bg5+, skewering through to win at least the Queen, and 23...Kf8 fares no better, as 24.Bc5+ forces Black to give up his Queen to prevent mate.} 23. Qh5+ Kf8 {?? As I mentioned above, this is deadly; correct was 23...Ke6. The rest is just an elegant mating net.} 24. Bc5+ Qd6 {Forced (24...Qe7 is certainly no better). Black soldiers on for a few more turns, but defeat is now inevitable.} 25. Bxd6+ cxd6 26. Rhxg7 Rxg7 27. Qh8+ Ke7 28. Nd5+ {1-0. It's mate in three (28...Kd7 29.Rxg7+ Nf7 30.Rxf7+ Kc6 31.Rc7#); Black sees it and throws in the towel after a hard-fought battle.
