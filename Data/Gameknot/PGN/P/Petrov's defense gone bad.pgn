1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 {Petrov's Defense. I favor taking the pawn, it leads to rapid engagement in the middle, and it seems most of the alternatives allow black to equalize early in the middle game.} Nxe4 4. Qe2 {Black was not supposed to play 3. ... Nxe4. Too soon. Now he must lose his knight. He cannot now play 4. ... N moves because 5. nc6  costs black his queen.} d5 5. d3 f6 6. Nf3 Qe7 7. dxe4 {And now the knight falls.} Qxe4 8. Nc3 {I didn't expect black to be so willing to trade queens when he is behind in material. Developing the knight with an attack against black's queen almost forces the queen back (white gains a tempo) or to exchange queens - either of which favors white.} Qxe2+ 9. Bxe2 Be6 10. Nd4 {A hunting I will go. I truly expected black to retreat to f7 to keep defense on his pawn.} Bd7 11. Nxd5 {Unexpected move by black. I cannot pass up the free pawn, and now a threat on c7 to gain black's rook.} Bd6 12. Bh5+ Kd8 13. O-O {Not really sure of a good attack here right now. White is up a by a knight, but that is not enough to win in the endgame. I need to use my advantage to leverage more of an advantage. But black is bottled up pretty tight, defensively, so for now I'm just devoloping.} Nc6 14. Be3 {Again, I don't expect black to keep trading material while he's down. So I figure I will develop my bishop a little, and open up my queen's rook. I wouldn't mind the exchange either, if black wants to trade knights.} Nxd4 15. Bxd4 {And now, I find my attack.} c6 16. Nxf6 {The pawn looks defended, but it wasn't. Now if 16. ... Pxf6, 17 Bxf6 forks the king and the rook. But, if black doesn't play that, moving his rook (to break the fork) lets white play 18 Nxh7. But moving his king allows white to play 18. Nxe7 Kxe7, 19 Bxg7. Maybe black's best answer is to relocate the bishop off of e7, such as with 16. ... Bf5.} gxf6 17. Bxf6+ Kc7 18. Bxh8 {Rook and two pawns for bishop and knight. Slight advantage for white.} Rxh8 19. Rad1 {We have only played 18 moves so far, but already this position feels like an endgame, so I decided to treat it like one. The biggest advantage for white is that now I have a clear pawn majority and a path to promotion of my supported passed pawn that is virutually guaranteed to win more material (or promote).} c5 20. f4 Bf5 21. c3 {Moving the threatened pawn seems preferable to defending it. I don't want my rooks tied to defense.} Bc2 22. Rd2 Bf5 23. g4 {Beginning the king-side steamroller.} Rg8 24. h3 {My g4 pawn is pinned and cannot take the bishop. Moving the king to break the pin loses the pawn. The only option is defense.} Bg6 25. Bxg6 {More unexpected exchanges. I am all in favor of clearing away the black pieces now. In fact, if I could exchange rooks, I would gladly sacrifice Rxd6 to eliminate his last piece, leaving me 3 pawns against 1 on the king-side.} Rxg6 26. f5 {And now my king-side pawns are all on squares his bishop cannot touch. I had thought this would give me time for rook maneuvers, or to bring my king forward to lend his support, all without worrying about black's bishop.} Rg5 27. f6 {By not getting his rook in front of the pawn, black gives his permission to white. Permission granted, I gladly accept.} h5 28. f7 hxg4 29. h4 {A sweet move if I do say so myself. If white takes the pawn, black recaptures with check and then he can maneuver his rook back to his back rank and defend f8 with both rook and bishop. Not at all what I want. Now black's rook is threatened, so Bf8 is out. Rg8 fails miserably. Black has nothing. White must gain a queen unless black leaves his rook to die.} Rh5 30. Rxd6 Kxd6 31. f8=Q+ Kc6 32. Qe8+ {And now black's rook dies. Black had nothing better. All six possible king moves allowed white's queen to fork the black king and rook.} Kb6 33. Qxh5 {Black resigned.}
