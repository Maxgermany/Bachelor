1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 {This is a Veresov wich is going to have some nice pawn formation.} 3. Bf4 a6 {Just preventing a close Knight} 4. Na4 e6 5. c3 Nh5 {Pawn close up, nice diagonal formation, symetric but whit a bishop thretning c2} 6. e3 Nxf4 {Went for a change to open Kings column} 7. exf4 c6 {Another close up by pawns, nice picture. Note that a prision has been formed leaving the white Knight trapped, it´s doomed.} 8. Nf3 Nd7 9. Ne5 {I think this is not too good for white} b5 {Pressure on the prisioner} 10. Nc5 {Two Knights front attack, but note that there is +1 for the black, 11. Nc4xN d4xc5 12 Bc4x.. } Nxc5 11. dxc5 Qc7 {Cautelous defence for breaking formation} 12. g4 f6 {I think i should won the pawn first, but well, pressure to the K see what happen} 13. Nd3 e5 14. fxe5 fxe5 15. b3 {This is a good formation, going for a fresh start, like new attack, or contraoffensive, black winning place} e4 {New pawn structure. Stairways formed giving a diagonal strong attack, i don´t know why but two diagonals cover usually falls into mistakes, they are hard to see (in this level of play of course). I mean diagonals by Bc1 and Qc2.} 16. Nf4 {See what i mean, but even g4 was doomed whit Knight retreat, ohh humans!! didn´t want to retraet and fell in, no one can blame, Knight to the back and  restores the original chess position, is awful so mind play tricks on us.} Qxf4 17. c4 {White searching room for a Queen-Rook counter attack maybe, if holes are open} Bxg4 {Completing the attack, Queen Bishop went downstairs, formation by pawn holding the white offensive} 18. Be2 Bxc5 {Most completed} 19. Rf1 {White into the waters of black evil} Bh3 20. Bh5+ {Inoffensive check} Kd8 21. f3 {And awful move} Qe3+ {Check and the rest is clear. 21 ..Qe2 22 Qc3 and rook dies} 22. Qe2 Qc3+ 23. Kd1 Qxa1+ 24. Kc2 Bxf1 25. Qd2 Bd3+ 26. Qxd3 {Attack worked and queen dead is going for mate} exd3+ 27. Kxd3 Qd1+ 28. Kc3 b4+ 29. Kb2 Bd4# {And a good looking mate! So Veresov, without a plan by white, retreating can be devastating. But i found really interesting the pawn structures i repeat:  5. Diagonal bicoulur formation, symetric (with a white bishop pushing just a little more) 7. Semicircle Prision to white Knight 14. Refreshing the attack, linear formation 15. Stairway formation 17. Stairway holding, Queen and Bishop double attack.  Thanks!! }
