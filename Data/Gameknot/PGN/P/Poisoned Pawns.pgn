[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {I play this a lot - I play 1. d4 against players >1300 and 1. e4 against players <1300 as you may have seen against my previous annotations. } d5 {1. ... d5.} 2. e3 {e3 - rather seen with stronger players that don't mind blocking their DSB.} Bf5 {My bishop surges into the game.} 3. Bd3 {This is a really annoying move - if Bxe3 then Qxd3 and white has developed more than I had, and if my bishop moves, then I lose a tempo - white's bishop is perfect on d3.} Bxd3 {Not much of a choice, but I choose to exchange.} 4. Qxd3 {He takes with the queen - the best move to avoid doubled pawns.} Nf6 {Knight surges into centre - I am preparing Ne4 perhaps.} 5. Qb5+ {Seeing this, this early queen check also forks the b-pawn.} Nc6 {Though this develops a piece, I actually think that c6 would have been better and if Qxb7 then Nbd7.} 6. Qxb7 {He greedily nabs the pawn.} Na5 {Probably not that great - I try to force him back.} 7. Qb5+ {Looking like a deadly queen fork - even when I looked at this, first-sight, a bead of sweat came towards me, but I can wriggle.} c6 {The pawn blocks the check and the queen protects the knight - perfect!} 8. Qd3 {The queen heads home.} e6 {Trying to give my DSB a path.} 9. Bd2 {Developing, and targeting my knight.} Bd6 {I develop my bishop.} 10. Nh3 {Flanky knight - as I call it. It has two other perfectly fine squares to go to, so why not go to them?} O-O 11. O-O {Castling from both sides.} Rb8 {My rook controls the half-open b-file.} 12. b3 {I don't see why this move was played.} Re8 {I develop my other rook.} 13. f4 {My opponent is getting aggressive.} Ne4 {Seeing that 14. f3 can no longer be played, I hop into the outpost of e4.} 14. Qa6 {Targeting my knight.} Bb4 {Of course, I didn't like Nb7 as it looked rather odd - so I opted for an exchange of B's.} 15. Bxb4 {He accepts - well, there was nothing else to do, really.} Rxb4 {I take back.} 16. a3 {Pawn v rook - my rook has no active square to go to.} Rb8 {Not Rb6? as the knight would have been under attack.} 17. Qxa7 {?? This occurred previously in one of my annotations - Why not to go to Scandinavia 1. This is a truly poisoned pawn, though rather this is less crude than the one that occurred in the Scandinavian annotation. Not Rb7?! but ...} Ra8 {Ra8! which traps the queen of the flight square a6 and leaves the queen with no good move. Let's sum up - it's rather pretty actually.  a6 and a5 is controlled by the a8-rook. a8, b8, c7, d7 and e7 are controlled by the d8 queen. b7 is controlled by the a5 knight. c5 is controlled by the e4 knight. } 18. Qxa8 {The only move to gain the maximum material.} Qxa8 {Who could resist such an offer?} 19. f5 {My opponent tries to open some lines against my king.} e5 {Unfortunately not.} 20. Ng5 {?? What about Nxg5.} Nxg5 {So I do so.} 21. f6 {Still trying to open lines - but as I did in my game vs tk29650 -} g6 {I decline the offer.} 22. Nd2 {Developing and attacking the rooks.} exd4 {Opening the e-file.} 23. exd4 Qc8 {Trying to centralize my queen.} 24. Rac1 {Developing still.} Qg4 {And black resigns here, thinking that after Re2 or Nf4/h4 he is doomed. But, other than the poisoned pawn, well played jagroop52. And I hope you enjoyed the game to. @oodle3.  EDIT (30/12/14): archduke_piccolo is right - white resigned, not black.}
