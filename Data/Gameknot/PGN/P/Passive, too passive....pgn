1. d3 {This opponent plays extreme defence.} d5 2. e3 e5 3. h3 {Waste of time, but... how to exploit it?} Nf6 4. a3 c5 {Playing as white with black. } 5. b3 Nc6 6. g3 Bd6 {"Just developing". } 7. Bb2 O-O 8. Bg2 Be6 9. Ne2 {White hyperpassive play is difficult to handle. } Qc7 10. Nd2 Rad8 11. Nb1 {!? White overextends his passive play. } d4 {Time to "do something". } 12. e4 {As it was to be expected... } Qa5+ 13. Qd2 b5 {At least I'll grab space!} 14. Qxa5 Nxa5 15. Nd2 {White is playing very easily, and I don't find a way to break in. } Nd7 {Tinking in Nb3 and c4.} 16. Ng1 {Relocating the N on f3.} Rdc8 {Preparing c4. } 17. Ngf3 h6 {No rush this time. This prevents Ng5. } 18. Ke2 c4 {Time to go. } 19. b4 {Ok, but...} cxd3+ 20. Kxd3 {After a long think. If cxd3, I have some chances on b3. Now, B or N to c4?} Nc4 {Either ways, I'll have a clamp on white's dsb. } 21. Nxc4 {Which piece to retake with? c2 is easy to defend for white... but enough?} bxc4+ {This impressive center must win...} 22. Ke2 {d3+ gives the center for nothing. } c3 23. Bc1 {White's dsb and R are unable to move.} Bc4+ 24. Ke1 {Decisive advantage, but... how to close? I now think that d3 was a must. } Nf6 {Eyeing e4, but...} 25. Nh4 {...I can't play g5 at once, because of Nf5, and his N is doing something. } Kh7 {? I always have d3, but I was to block any possible countergame first. } 26. Nf5 Bc7 {Now white N's force is fooled.} 27. Ne7 {Just helps me relocating my R. } Rcd8 28. Nc6 Rd7 29. a4 {White can take the A pawn, true, but... d3 will come!} d3 30. cxd3 {It was a won game, wasn't it?} Rxd3 {? Blunder!} 31. Bf1 {Ouch! That's blitz... :-(} Nxe4 {I'll lose an exchange by force, so why not to grab this juicy central pawn... } 32. Bxd3 Bxd3 {...and make him hard to castle?} 33. g4 {Planless... } Ng5 {? Nf3+, Kd1, c2#. But...} 34. Bxg5 hxg5 35. Rc1 {...and now the tactic: } Be4 {It's not a real fork, since after...} 36. Rg1 {If BxN, Rxc3, and one of my B is gone. I'll grab a5, but he a7... no deal.} Bb6 {? Giving c3 for nothing...} 37. Rxc3 {[%clk 0:02:13] } Rc8 {...but this. White can defend...} 38. b5 Ba5 {I'll lose my B pair, but I can't see more. } 39. Kd2 {An exchange and a pawn... maybe two...} Bxc3+ 40. Kxc3 Bxc6 41. bxc6 Rxc6+ {...and this should roughly be a draw!} 42. Kb4 Rc2 {Playing with his pawns...} 43. Re1 {Exchanges? Not at all...} f6 {[%clk 0:02:45] } 44. f3 {That gives me a pawn.} Rf2 {...or Rg2, it's the same.} 45. Re3 Rh2 46. Ka5 Rxh3 47. Ka6 {I have to hurry for a draw.} f5 48. gxf5 g4 {This was my last weapon...} 49. Rxe5 {If gxf3, Re3.} g3 50. Re4 {he has g4...} g2 {Two pawns for one. } 51. Rg4 Rxf3 52. Rxg2 Rxf5 53. Kxa7 Ra5+ 54. Kb6 Rxa4 {...and this should be a drawn... or not? I never remember...} 55. Rh2+ Kg8 56. Rd2 Rc4 57. Kb5 Rc8 58. Rh2 g6 59. Rg2 Kf7 60. Kb6 Kf6 61. Rf2+ Kg7 62. Rg2 Rc1 63. Kb5 Rf1 {I'll try this way, but it smells like drawn. } 64. Kb4 Kf6 65. Kc3 g5 66. Kd3 Kf5 67. Ke2 Rf4 68. Rf2 {and the WK has the opposition...} g4 69. Rxf4+ Kxf4 {...and... can you believe it? My opponent resigned!}
