[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), Tartakower (fantasy) variation"]

1. e4 {I was playing black in this second of training matches with a friend for the U 1700 section of the Chicago Open 2012.  I am a caro kann player and had let my friend borrow my theory notes for lots of variations to test me in some lines.  This game features the fantasy variation.} c6 2. d4 d5 3. f3 {The fantasy variation.} dxe4 4. fxe4 e5 {Theory, I learned this from video lectures of GM Shankland.} 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. c3 {A good move to support the center and allow potential tricks for white. dc is possible but not recommended if white is trying for an edge.} Nd7 7. Bc4 Bh5 {! A key move, still theory.  The idea is not to play Nf6 in the move order after c3 and Bc4 by white so that Qb3 isn't such a killer.} 8. O-O Ngf6 9. Bd3 {On c4 after ...Bh5 the lsb was misplaced and so it retreats to add Nimzowitschian overprotection to the e4 pawn.} Bd6 10. Qe1 O-O 11. Bg5 {This is theoretically black's ideal set up, and this Bg5 plan by white is a good try to maintain central tension (bishop pins attacker of e4 square, which is the tender point and target in the white camp).} Qb6 {I deviate from GM Shankland's recommendation of a simple Qc7, although the position may be fine either way for black.  We cannot conclude that black has equalized but I like the pressure this exerts on the center.} 12. b4 {?!} exd4 13. a3 {??} dxc3+ 14. Be3 Qc7 15. Qh4 Ne5 16. Nxe5 Bxe5 17. Ra2 Bg6 {The programmed response to Qh4.  Thematically, this pressures the weak e4 point and sets up for a tactic o h2, which was playable here as well.} 18. Raf2 {??} Bxh2+ {0-1. If Qxh2 Qxh2+ Kxh2 Ng4+ Kg3 Nxe3. If Kh1 Bg3 Qh3 Bxf2}
