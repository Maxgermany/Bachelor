1. e4 {Hi everyone!  In this game I seemed to be in the grip of passivitis yet again.  But, suddenly, out of nowhere, comes an attack on Rick's king which first wins a pawn and then the exchange.  A killer pawn fork at the end brings about Rick's resignation.  So, how does this happen?  Well, read on.  Here is the GK analysis to help you follow this game of which starts off as a Ruy Lopez.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15252003&fb=1&rnd=0.32452067174571786} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 {3. ..... g6 - I try an unusual variation of the Lopez to throw my Class C opponent off piste, just like my Expert and Master buddies!} 4. c3 a6 5. Ba4 d6 {5. ...... d6 - this is getting to be more like a classic Lopez set up, with the exception of the kingside on which Fou Lenoir's resting place will be g7.  The usual place for that prelate is e7 in the Lopez.} 6. d4 Bd7 {6. ...... Bd7 - pin breaker.} 7. O-O Bg7 8. d5 Nce7 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {9. ...... Qxd7 - after the bishop trade my position looks rather passive.  Having said that, as typical with a Ruy Lopez, white tends to lag behind in developing the queenside.  I do now have the option of leaving Henry where he is or to castle queenside.  Before making this commitment I decided to stop the incursion of a minor piece on g5 with the move h6.} 10. c4 h6 11. Nc3 f5 {11. .... f5 - I think about a pawn storm.} 12. Ne1 Nf6 13. f3 f4 14. Nd3 g5 {14. ...... g5 - and it gathers momentum.} 15. b4 Ng6 16. c5 O-O {16. ..... 0-0 - I finally decided to put Henry on the kingside and then on the next move, put him on h8 out of the discovery diagonal a2-g8 (the Wicked Witch of the West lands on b3 the very next move).} 17. Qb3 Kh8 18. Bb2 g4 19. Ne2 gxf3 20. Rxf3 {20. Rxf3? - tempting recapture to avoid the kingside pawns from being split in front of the WK and to perhaps prepare a counter attack on the kingside but the drawback is - it leaves the e4 pawn hanging and my horsie on f6 makes fodder of it!} Nxe4 21. Rc1 {21. Rc1?? - now the exchange drops with a knight fork on d2.} Nd2 22. c6 Nxb3 {22. ...... Nxb3 - I decided to swipe the Witch off the board and allow Glenda to hang as there is still a WR en prise on c1.  There is no way the WP on d7 will crown so I remain a good exchange up.} 23. cxd7 Nxc1 24. Bxc1 Rad8 {24. ....... Rad8 - I decided to corrall that little footman at once.} 25. Bd2 {25. Bd2 - I missed a pawn fork on the last move but luckily my opponent gives me a second chance.  Of course, there is always B or N x P on f4 but I did calculate that I would still be considerable material up in the coming endgame and it would give me a chance to simplify further.   Gameknot Analysis thought that Rxd7 was better but Rick did not seem to think so, which was the main thing, because immediately after I executed the pawn fork he waved the white flag!   Amazing, a winning attack comes out of nowhere from the queen of defense and passivitis, jstevens1!  Anyhow, hope you have all had a good read.  There is a third installment of the Pawn fork theme to come - bye for now - Joanne} e4 {}
