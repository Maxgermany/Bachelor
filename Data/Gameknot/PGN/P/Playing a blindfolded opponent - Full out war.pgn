[Opening "Sicilian (B23), Grand Prix attack, Schofman variation"]

1. e4 {Those who have read some of my previous annotations will already know this, but I can't emphasize enough that Bert and I, are fundamentally very different players. Our preferred playstyles, positions, openings and approach to the game are about as different as can be. This is already shown as soon as move 1 where he plays e4 whereas I'll stick to my favoured d4. For example: I prefer my positions closed and with room for some error, where I can slowly grind my opponent into creating small weaknesses that I can later take advantage of. In contrast, he usually has the tendency to create open positions in which there are many complications and where the opposing player usually has to play incredibly accurate to survive. The moves or sacrifices he plays aren't always 100% correct ( the computer will often agree with me on this point ), but the positions he creates often pressure the opponent in overlooking a small detail or making an error. As such there's a lot we can learn from each other and our games become rather exciting every once in a while.} c5 2. Nc3 {Closed Sicilian. I know that Bert used to play the Alapin, however nowadays he prefers the grand prix attack from what I've heard. My experience versus the grand prix is very limited as not a lot of people tend to play it here in Belgium so I don't really know the opening theory behind it. We'll somehow manage.} Nc6 {Taking a more waiting approach. Usually I'd just bust e6 out immediately, however in the closed Sicilian I like to wait a bit longer to see what exact variation we're playing so that I change it up by playing d6 instead if I deem it better.} 3. f4 {And this is the point where I realize we're going to be playing the Grand Prix attack. It's not that popular among players because it's deemed that Black equalises too easily if they actually know what they're doing, but it's definitely playable at the clublevel and in my opinion leads to interesting games.} g6 {I was considering Qc7 for a second, going for my usual Taimanov setup and getting rid of booktheory immediately, but it didn't feel quite as convincing. I wasn't too scared of Nb5 or Nd5 as it's common in the Taimanov to answer that threat with Qb8, but I didn't want my queen all the way on b8 since I knew that a strong attacking plan would be coming my way rather soon ( as e5 or f5 are common plans in the grand prix for white to start up an attack ) and a queen on b8 doesn't exactly help in defending that. Instead I opt for g6 with the idea of playing Bg7. My pawn on c5 probably won't be fiercely attacked and it's easy to defend it with d6 later so I'd rather have my bishop on the a1-h8 diagonal where it's really strong. g6 is also the main line according to Bert which surprised me a little.} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 {Putting pressure on the knight who could be an important defender in the future.} Qc7 {Stepping out of main theory. Qc7 looks a bit strange because of Nd5, however I thought about it for a second and after 6.Nd5 Qb8 7.d3 e6 8. Nc3 a6 9. Ba4 b5 10. Bb3 Nd4 I think black is doing just fine. Black is getting a lot of space on the queenside which is what usually happens in the Taimanov and Kan variations of the open Sicilian that I like to play in exchange for vulnerable dark squared diagonals, but that shouldn't be an issue with my dark squared bishop being placed on g7. At the very least I'd be very familiar with the attacking plans of Black if nothing else considering the similarity it'd have with what I usually play. I assume Qc7 isn't one of the mainlines because there's a better alternative, but at the very least I thought it was interesting.} 6. O-O {Probably the best move, as it brings the rook on the important f-file so it can help in playing f5 in the future. His king is also relatively safe there as it's not easy for black to actually make use of the dark a7-g1 diagonal. At the same time he's also inviting black to capture on f4, which would most likely end up in a disaster as it's an easy square for White to attack and White will most likely get compensation with either center control ( with for example d4 ) or maybe several tempi and the quick development of all his pieces.} a6 {Attacking the bishop. if he retreats Ill push b5 and try my chances there in the future. If he captures I get the bishop pair. I don't mind either situation.} 7. Bxc6 {Surprisingly he captures the knight. I'd assume he'd want as many pieces on the board for his eventual attack so I thought it a little bit strange at first, but it has a few good reasons when you think about it. He probably felt like his bishop wouldn't do a lot on b3 and giving me the d4 square for my knight is indeed not the most pleasant thing. On top of that, we have to take into consideration that he's playing without looking at the board, so removing a piece of the board can remove some of the strain.} Qxc6 {A small inaccuracy. I should have played bxc6 instead so that I can play d5 more easily in the future or dxc6 so that I can easily develop my light squared bishop and place my rook on d8. White now has ideas of playing Ne5 which forces Black to retreat the queen or quietly develop and target the queen more easily later on. That being said, it's not a huge error. Instead of contesting the center if bxc6 was played, I'll most likely start up a minority attack at the queenside. Black's structure is still very solid with little exploitable weaknesses.} 8. d3 {Making room for the dark squared bishop to develop after f5 is played or to go to e3 if he wishes to target my pawn on c5.} b5 {Getting a lot of space on the queenside and preparing to develop the light squared bishop on b7. I was considering the idea of playing d6 instead to try and develop my bishop by playing it along the c8-h3 diagonal,but after h3, I'm not sure where the bishop would end up.} 9. Qe1 {Indirectly aiming at my king who hasn't castled yet and preparing Qh4 in case I had castling plans.} Nf6 {I decide that it's about time I brought my king to safety before I start any attack. The short term plan is to castle, play Bb7, get my rook on f8 to b8,c8 or d8 depending on the situation and then push my pawns. An unrated or 1200 elo player might give me enough time to do all that, but Bert knows better then to allow me to solidify my position and start attacking plans.} 10. f5 {The attack starts.} O-O {I decide to ignore it for the time being. Maybe it was the appropriate timing to play a move like b4 now that his knight doesn't have a lot of squares left and then play a5 after, but I wanted to bring my king into safety first. In an actual game I would give a move like b4 a lot of consideration and probably even spend up to half an hour looking at it, but considering we're playing on a quicker pace I played the logical O-O. I expected e5 to follow after castling, but after Nd5 it doesn't look too bad for black.} 11. Qh4 {Probably not the best move, but one that does create various problems. The plan for White is very simple, play Ng5, play e5 and because it threatens checkmate it's not possible for the knight to go anywhere but h4 where it doesn't do a whole lot, but it's the only square for the knight that prevents checkmate. After that white simply plays g4 and it looks rather grim for Black. White will be up material at the cost of having an exposed king, but my pieces are in no position to take advantage of an exposed king right now. It's up to me to find an appropriate defense that won't ruin my pawnstructure too much.} d6 {I decide to let my light squared bishop aim at White's kingside first as it'll prove a great help in defending in the near future. Ng5 gets met with h5. Then, after fxg6 fxg6 Black's pawn structure is very questionable, but it looks like a holdable position.} 12. Ng5 h5 13. Rf3 {An inaccuracy. White should play fxg6, weakening Black's castled structure significantly before bringing the rook into the attack.} gxf5 {Instead of being stuck with a weak pawn on g6, I'd rather be stuck with a weak pawn on h5, especially since he won't have any pawns to attack my knight on f6 with after recapturing on f5, which is the sole defender of that pawn and probably the one piece that holds my structure together.} 14. exf5 d5 {In my opinion the only correct move that Black has. Black, realistically, can't allow for the knight on c3 to come to e4 and pressure the knight on f6. If the knight on f6 gets traded for a piece of similar value then Black will be a pawn down after Qxh5 and that will be the least of his worries. It are moves like these that his opponents often struggle to find under time pressure which lose them the game. At the same time this is also setting up nicely for any attacking ideas on the queenside as those 4 pawns are looking really strong.} 15. Ne2 {Moving his knight to e2 as he realises I won't give it the opportunity to go to e4. Instead he hopes to play Nf4, pressuring the h5 pawn. By making the preemptive Ne2 move, he also avoids me exploiting his knight by attacking with my pawns in the near future.} c4 {Opening the a7-g1 diagonal once more so I can give checks there if needed via Qb6+ or Qc5+ At the same time I'm creating trouble on the queenside. The interesting part of this move is that the first instinct, which is to take on c4 is most likely not the best move as after 16. dxc4 Qxc4 17. Qxc4 dxc4 18. c3/Rf1 ( either of the 2 will work imo ) Bb7 black stands fine. I'd even go as far as to say that Black stands slightly better due to the possibility of the e-pawn becoming a passed pawn, the advantage in space on the queenside and the possibility of g4 becoming a very strong square for the knight on f6. Defending the f5 pawn will also make it so that White won't have too many attacking opportunities anymore, giving the initiative of the attack to black. Instead White should ignore this move and probably play either Nd4, Ng3 or Nf4. Nd4 isn't too great because of the pin with Qb6. Ng3 and Nf4 accomplish the same thing, namely targeting the weak h5 pawn, but Black has compensation for the pawn in terms of his strong queenside and actually capturing on h5 leads to quite a few complications.} 16. Nf4 {Ng3 was better because now the complications arise with my following move.} Bxf5 {Nf4 blocks off the f-file, which is why Ng3 was probably better. That being said, Ng3 does obstruct the rook from going to g3, pinning the bishop in the future.} 17. Nxh5 {Winning back the lost pawn.} Nxh5 18. Qxh5 {Probably the first big mistake in this game. Better was Rxf5 as the bishop in this position is far too strong when it gets to g6. Most of White's attacking plans are done after I get to play Bg6 and with both my bishops aiming at his queensidestructure I'm bound to win a pawn sooner or later. If Rxf5 was played then the position was probably more or less equal after 18. Rxf5 Qb6+ 19. Kh1 Qg6, but now I think Black's position is just better. I'm pretty sure Bert would have played Rxf5 had he actually seen the position on a board, but Qxh5 must have seemed a lot more threatening in his head.} Bg6 {Getting 2 excellent bishops, chasing away the queen and solidifying my weak castled structure... Or what's left of it I suppose.} 19. Qh4 f6 {Now that I have chased away the queen, I decide to end all his attacking ideas once and for all by chasing away the knight. The only square it has is h3, which will block his rook from getting there. f7 also has the added benefit of creating a flight square for my king.} 20. Nh3 e5 {Getting as much space as possible and controlling the f4 square which he'd like to use for his knight.} 21. Rg3 {Attacking the bishop I want to keep my bishop on g6 there for as long as possible so Kf7 is the appropriate defense. It doesn't look safe, but it all comes together nicely.} Kf7 22. Qg4 {Adding a second attacker. There's only 1 correct defense to this.} f5 {Adding a second defender on my bishop and at the same time attacking the queen.} 23. Ng5+ {Giving a check before retreating his queen. Black has to go back to g8 as moving to e7 or e8 can get rather tricky and f6 just loses after Nh7+ Bxh7 Qxg7+.} Kg8 24. Qe2 f4 {Trying to cramp his position as much as possible.} 25. Rh3 Qf6 {Threatening the knight.} 26. Nf3 e4 {I looked at dxe4, but after Black plays dxe4 it seems really scary for White since the pawn on e4 has no pawns to stop it anymore.} 27. Ne1 {Bert realises this and retreats the knight in an attempt to defend against this pawn storm.} Qd4+ 28. Kh1 {I really want a knight on f2 right now, but I suppose that would make this position a tad too easy.} Rae8 {It occurred to me that his bishop on c1, rook on a1 and my rook on a8 hadn't moved so far as they never really had the time to do so, so I decide to bring my rook on a1 into the action, especially since the e-pawn probably will be traded in the near future.} 29. Qg4 {Trying to win a piece in case I'm careless.} exd3 {He can't capture my bishop on g6 because of Rxe1+ checkmate. exd3 is actually a mistake though. White should have played Qf2 instead, threatening checkmate on e1 and f1 depending on wether he moves the knight or not. The only defense to Qf2 is Nf3 after which I can freely capture his knight with his pawn with exf3 and threaten checkmate in 1 again. After that he's forced to move his bishop to d2, covering the e1 square so that Qe1 Rxe1 Rxe1 checkmate doesn't happen. After Bd2 you can either win the bishop on d2 or even better, play fxg2+ after which everything just goes wrong and the position becomes near unplayable for White to a point where there's no point in playing on.} 30. Bd2 Bf5 {And here Bert resigns as the position becomes really grim for White. Even if you somehow manage to hold on as White, then I highly doubt that you'll be winning the endgame. It was an interesting game, filled with attacking possibilities. Had Bert chosen to play Rxf5 on move 18 instead, then it probably would have ended in a draw. If he had had the chance to develop his dark squared bishop earlier into the game, then I probably would have lost. It just confirms my suspicions that Bert, even when he's not looking at the board is an opponent I can never underestimate.}
