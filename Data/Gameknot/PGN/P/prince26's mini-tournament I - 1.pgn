[Opening "Bird (A02), From gambit, Lasker variation"]

1. f4 e5 {I have limited experience of playing against Bird's opening; on previous occasions I have played positionally with 1...d5 , Nf6 e6 , but I read recently that this gambit can (sometimes) pose problems for white! } 2. fxe5 d6 3. exd6 Bxd6 4. Nf3 g5 {Trying the line I read about. However, I was discouraged to discover that my opponent had programmed in conditional moves up to and including move 8! } 5. c3 g4 6. Qa4+ Nc6 7. Qe4+ Nge7 8. Nd4 Nxd4 9. Qxd4 {The queen is being a nuisance. The rook on h8 is now under attack. Would you castle here? } Ng6 10. Qe4+ {An awkward check to face. The queen is nicely centralised and exerts strong pressure against b7, hence why I cannot block this check comfortably.} Kf8 {Seemed the only move.} 11. g3 {White is trying to dominate the h1-a8 diagonal, which would potentially freeze my Queenside development. He is a pawn up, although none of his minor pieces are developed, and the queen has already moved 4 times. For these reasons I embarked upon a strategy of reckless aggression!} f5 12. Qc2 f4 {The attacking potential of my queen and bishop is the justification for this quick pawn advance. } 13. Bg2 c6 {Could have taken on g3 but first I preferred to limit the bishop and to keep the tension near his king.} 14. O-O Kg7 15. Qb3 Rf8 16. c4 Be5 {An important move. Defends my king and prevents d4. The white queen does a good job of preventing my Queenside development, however the bishop on c8 is actually fairly active, and it defends b7.} 17. d3 {This move undefends g3.} fxg3 18. Rxf8 {With my king on g7 I can afford a zwischenzug here to suddenly emerge a pawn up with a dangerous attack.} gxh2+ 19. Kh1 Qxf8 {Qf2 followed by Nh4 is a strong idea. White prevents this.} 20. Be3 Nh4 {The g2 bishop is currently the only piece defending the king. It cannot move due to Qf1#, so it will be exchanged. With the white king trapped in the corner I had the idea of taking on g2 and getting a deadly fianchettod on b7. My opponent responded combatively to this idea.} 21. Nd2 {I thought Nc3 was better, as this allows me to execute my plan.} Nxg2 22. Kxg2 c5 {Another important move, I thought. It prevented white from any c5 ideas himself, and it prepares b6 next. With a knight on c3 instead, my move would have weakened d5 perhaps a bit too much. } 23. Ne4 b6 24. Qb5 {Good move. White has counterplay with Qc6 and my open king. For example Bb7 now would spoil my attack after Qd7+. } Qf7 {Still trying to play Bb7! } 25. Rf1 {This is a losing blunder, but I did not see it. 25...Qxf1 wins immediately, but I went blindly into something messy and murky!} Qh5 26. Kh1 Qh3 {Hitting the rook. Now my opponent played a shocking move.} 27. Rf7+ {!! I dealt with this beautiful move poorly, but on further analysis it appears that Rf7 loses for white.} Kxf7 {Declining the rook leads to ruin. Kg8/h8 Qe8#, and Kg6 Qc6+ Kh5 Rxh7. } 28. Ng5+ Ke7 {Another blunder. Kg7 wins the game as it avoids the line white missed to get an advantage.} 29. Nxh3 {Instead, Bxc5+! For example bxc5 , Nxh3 , and now the check Bb7 is blocked with e4! The game would have continued with gxh3, but White would have had the initiative with an extra queen. } Bb7+ {The king gets mated. }
