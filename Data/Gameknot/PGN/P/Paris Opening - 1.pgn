1. Nh3 {This is a themed opening where white has a counter intuitive first move} d5 {I respond with the Queen's pawn, opening the white squared bishop} 2. g3 e5 {Now e5 taking control of the centre} 3. d4 e4 4. e3 {The pawn on e4 looks sronger now} Nf6 {Threatening B-g4} 5. Bb5+ {This is a wasted move, it gives black a tempo, and allows black to apply pressure on the kingside} c6 6. Bf1 Bg4 7. Qd2 {White is very cramped and black is going to open up white's kingside a little} Bf3 8. Rg1 Ng4 9. Bg2 Nxh2 {it is only a pawn, but the removal of the white squared bishop will cause black problems} 10. Rh1 Bxg2 11. Rxh2 Bf3 12. Nc3 Nd7 13. Ng1 Bg4 {Black wants to keep this bishop as white has a weakness on white squares} 14. Rh4 h5 15. f4 exf3 e.p. 16. Qf2 Qf6 17. Bd2 O-O-O 18. O-O-O g5 19. Rh2 Bd6 {White is still cramped, white should push the e pawn or put his rook on f1, although pushing the e pawn may lead to a knight sacrifice, as the idea of a later h5 has good possibilities as does the poor position of the knight on g1} 20. a3 {Well this is a passive move onward with my plan} h4 21. Rh1 {The pawns are just going to rumble on} hxg3 22. Rxh8 Rxh8 23. Na2 {I have no idea of the purpose of this move but I'm happy to take the queen} gxf2 24. Nxf3 Qxf3 {Now black has a mate threat} 25. Nc3 Rh1 {Black maintains the mate threat it is just a matter of time now} 26. Rxh1 Qxh1+ 27. Nd1 Qxd1# {}
