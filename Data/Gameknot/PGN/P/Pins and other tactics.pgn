Qd5+ {Forking the King and the b-pawn.} Ke8 10. Bxh8 {I munch on a rook.} Nf6 11. Qe6+ Be7 {Learn from past failures...} 12. Bxf6 {Again a pin wins a piece.} Nd7 13. Nc3 {?? What in the world made me do that?} Kf8 {? Taking the bishop was mandatory.} 14. Bxe7+ {I exchange it off.} Qxe7 15. Qxe7+ Kxe7 16. Nd5+ Kd8 17. Nf3 {I complete my development...} c6 18.
