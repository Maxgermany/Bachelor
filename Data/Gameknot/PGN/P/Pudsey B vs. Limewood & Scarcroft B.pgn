[White "Shaw, Peter (133)"]

[Opening "Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Expecting a KID or Tango here, nice and easy to get things going. } 2. Bg5 {Oh so now we are in a Trompowsky and I don't usually like systems however, if I can provoke e4 then we transpose into a French. } e6 3. e4 {One of the standard moves in this position where white is happy to transpose into a French. The main alternative is: Alternative variation: 3. Nf3 d5 4. c4 Be7 5. Nc3 [Which makes more sense for a d4 player and I would have been less comfortable in a position like this.] } Be7 {The standard reply, preparing d5 by removing the threat of pawn to e5. Alternative variation: [I was still a little unsettled and possibly a bit agitated at this point and I very nearly touched my d-pawn to play] 3... d5 [Which would have been okay but would have been a mistake on my part as it wouldn't have been a position I was intending to enter.] 4. e5 [Although after] h6 5. Be3 ([There can be some complications such as the following line] 5. exf6 [When after] hxg5 6. fxg7 Bxg7 [Black now appears to be ahead in development and I would definitely say that he's better here. I would have to be careful in a position like this however, its not as easy as it looks.]) 5... Nfd7 6. f4 c5 [We would still have a typical French position.] } 4. Bxf6 {To me this was a huge commitment from white as he's immediately giving up his bishop pair before the pawn structure is even determined. He's clearly hoping to close the centre where he will try and make his knights stronger than my bishops. Alternative variation: [I think better would have been to just continue development as I'm not entirely sure the move played is better for white.] 4. Bd3 d5 5. e5 Nfd7 [When we reach a more standard type of Steinitz position and white can trade equally bishop for bishop. My good bishop for his bad bishop, in fact! White would be better here so I was happy to not see this.] } Bxf6 5. e5 Be7 {The loss of tempo with the bishop here isn't a bad thing as the centre is closed and I'm not even behind in development anyway! Even though the centre is about to become fully closed, my bishop pair should be an advantage in the long run. Especially if I can reach an endgame. } 6. Nf3 d5 7. c3 c5 {Happy to have now reached a French like position. Who's have thought that would happen after 1.d4?! } 8. Be2 Nc6 {Taking advantage of my increased control of the dark squares. } 9. O-O Qb6 {Continuing with my dark square strategy whilst white continues to develop his pieces. I was fairly happy here and I think black is better. } 10. Qd2 {Seems like a strange square for the queen as it won't have much of a life on the dark squares after the Bxf6 trade and it blocks the b1 knight. The next few moves will become more clear, however. } O-O 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. b4 {Trying to grab some dark squares back but these pawns will only become more of a weakness later on as black has more power over this colour complex. Alternative variation: 12. Na3 [ With the idea of going to c2 and fighting for some dark square control.] } Be7 {The only square unfortunately. Alternative variation: [I looked at this] 12... Nxb4 13. cxb4 Bxb4 14. Qd3 [But it's just far too good for white.] } 13. Na3 {The point of why white wasn't bothered about blocking his Knight with Qd2. } Bd7 {As in many french positions, I am going to have my work cut out in trying to activate this light squared bishop. I looked at a couple of options, which I will discuss later on. } 14. Nc2 {Heading for d4 where it will be a very strong piece indeed! } Rfd8 {I was a little worried about the X-Ray attack of the Queen on my hanging light squared Bishop, this was the main reason for ...Rfe8.  Alternative variation: [For instance, if I was to play something like] 14... Rac8 [I didn't want to encourage stuff like] 15. Rad1 ([I knew the immediate] 15. c4 [Wasn't anything to worry about due to] dxc4 16. Qxd7 Rfd8 [When the Queen is lost, but I didn't want to leave the Bishop hanging just in case I wanted to use ideas involving pawn to a5, when the Knight would be required to move and this trick no longer works.]) 15... a5 16. b5 Na7 17. c4 [When the pawn is pinned to the bishop.] } 15. Ncd4 {My bishops are currently looking much worse than white's Knights but my position is still fine here and holds more potential than white's, in the long run. } Nxd4 16. Nxd4 {After this move I spent absolutely ages trying to figure out what to play. I looked at ...a5 for a long time and decided against it in the end and played a much safer move. I think after I played my next move, I was about 15 minutes down on the clock. } a6 {Alternative variation: 16... a5 [This is the move I really wanted to play and to be honest, it was the reason why I played ...Rfe8 in the first place. I found it very hard to concentrate in this game as my oppooent kept making his move then standing up and looking down at me with his arms crossed, as if he was some super GM or something. It was very distracting for me. I'm not making excuses, ...a5 was probably the best response, I looked at it and decided against it. Let's have a look at a line or two in this variation.] 17. b5 (17. a3 [Bit more passive but still okay for white, black retains his slight edge.] Rdc8 [No longer required on e8 as the X-Ray attack is no longer there.] 18. Qe3 Rc7 [And black just slowly improves the position of his pieces.]) 17... Rac8 18. Rac1 f6 19. f4 a4 [When black has an edge, nothing more than that though but my pieces are starting to look a little more effective.] } 17. Kh1 {Blatantly wanting to play f4 next! } f6 {Preparing to exchange on e5 after white plays his intended f4 move. } 18. f4 fxe5 19. fxe5 Rdf8 {Couldn't find anything better here than to just go for an endgame where black has the advantage of the bishop pair and the slightly stronger/ safer pawns. } 20. Rxf8+ Rxf8 21. Rf1 Rxf1+ {I was happpy to trade pieces off as I didn't want white having too much of a possibility of being able to target e6. } 22. Bxf1 Qd8 {I was planing on gaining some activity with ...Bg5 here  but didn't like the idea of my Queen being tied down to the dark squares so I soon changed my mind on that one. } 23. Qe3 Qe8 24. Qf3 Qf7 {Here I just offered a draw and after a little look at the other boards, white accepted. I probably have a slightly better position but maybe not enough to win, especially considering that I was behind on time yet again. A draw with black against someone 8 pts lower than be isn't too bad I suppose. I wasn't settled during this game and found it very hard to concentrate so to extend my unbeaten Leeds run is decent. Very happy with my return to chess so far but there's still a lot of improving to be done. Onwards and upwards! }
