[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {This is called Philidor's defence. Most people seem to prefer 2. ...Nc6 as it allows the flexibility to deploy the dark-square Bishop. Even with a fianchetto setup, if Black can't open central lines, his Bishop will be doomed to a life of inactivity.} 3. d4 h6 {This move seems too passive to me. It gives White a free tempo to develop as he pleases. Instead Black should have developed normally, as a Knight or a Bishop on g5 is easily countered with ...Be7 or ...h6 (with tempo this time).} 4. dxe5 d5 {This just gives up the pawn. If there was a gambit-like aspiration behind it, it doesn't appear to work, because even though after 5. exd5 White's pawns are far enough forward that they have the potential to become targets, Black has no  concrete way of attacking them. They completely dominate the center and force Black's Knights on to less than ideal squares. And, even if White ends up having to give back one of these pawns, he remains ahead in material!} 5. exd5 a6 {Another wasted tempo. And this one takes one of the Knight's precious squares away from it.} 6. Nc3 {It wouldn't be abnormal to play 6. c4 here. In fact, I think White should have played it before Nc3. It contributes to the center, which could be very hard to defend due to its advanced nature.} Nd7 {Normally, Knights are supposed to be developed before Bishops, but when the only square the Knight can go to blocks the Bishop, it is usually wiser to develop the Bishop first. As Black's two pawn moves have severely restricted his Knights, he should worry about getting his Bishops to active squares first. Moves like ...Bg4, ...Bb4, and ...Bc5 should be Black's first priority. Especially the moves that pin the Knights, because he's already squandered away two full tempos and pawns. He should first try to restrain, and then try to undermine White's center.} 7. Bf4 {7. Be3 was also possible, but this allows White to play defensively with Bg3 if the need arises. Of course, by not playing Be3, White has chosen to the pawn on f2 vulnerable. However, that pawn doesn't really need to be defended as White will be able to castle in two moves, and Black can't take advantage of its vulnerability fast enough.} g5 {This was one of the key draw-backs of playing the Bishop to f4. (I didn't cover it in the last comment because it happened here). While White is happy to play his Bishop to g3 for defence, Black is suddenly able aim his guns at the center with ...Bg7. Also, he gets to kick off his pawn storm with a tempo! It's a good thing that White hasn't committed to castling yet, because now he can castle queenside and punish Black's choice not to wait to play g5 until White had committed. } 8. Bg3 h5 9. e6 {I think White would have been safer by playing 9. h4 where the Bishop has some guarantee of its safety.  However, White has decided to blow apart the center for a reason: He wants to punish Black for his utter lack of development. It looks like it would have been stronger to first apply pressure to the center via h4 and then moves like Bc4, Qe2 and O-O-O, but this isn't bad.} Nc5 10. exf7+ {There it is: White drags the Black King out into the ominously clear parts of the board.} Kxf7 11. Ne5+ {White starts his attack by bringing the knight into enemy territory and clearing f3 for the Queen to occupy, he also allows the option of a discovery after 11. ...Kg7 12. Qd4.} Kg7 12. Qd4 {White chooses to make the most direct threat to the Black King.} Nf6 {Black defends by adding a buffer piece to the a1-h8 diagonal.} 13. h4 {White's plan is fairly deceptive. If Black takes the pawn on h4, then White will get a key foothold into the position with his Bishop. However, if Black chooses to advance the pawn to g4, then the c1-h6 diagonal will open up for White's Bishop or Queen to use later. White's dark-squared Bishop can get the same foothold by playing from g3-f4-g5 if he decides that's how he wants to continue. Either way, Black's position gets more dangerous.} g4 14. O-O-O {White gets his King out of the way of any potential pins on the Knight on e5, and brings his rook to put pressure on the d-file at the same time.} Rh7 {This move was designed to burn another tempo (as if he needs to keep doing that), but it lets White's light-square Bishop develop with tempo! Instead of playing Bd3 right away, I think that White should play 15. b4! booting the only contention of d3 out of its spot, and allowing the Bishop to remain on the board after Bd3.} 15. Bd3 Nxd3+ 16. Nxd3 {White's attack seems a little diminished here. Although he holds a nice pin on the f6 Knight, his pieces have all fallen back to the third rank, and his position feels passive. Though White is still way ahead in development, his pieces need to be repositioned so they are more effective.} Kg8 {Black unpins the Knight and moves his King to safety.} 17. Be5 {White's repositioning come just one move too late! Oh well, the Bishop is much happier being on e5 than it was on g3, especially since there's nothing to defend because White castled long.} Bg7 {Black's position is getting less and less bad, so White had better hurry up and fix that.} 18. f3 {White tries to open up some lines for his rooks.} g3 19. Bxg3 {Here probably could have gotten away with letting the pawn hang there, as there was no rush to recapture it. In fact, by choosing to recapture right away White is giving up his attack for a safer game that he'll win in the endgame.} Ne8 20. Be5 {Looking to trade off his pieces and move into a winning endgame.} b6 21. d6 {This is an interesting idea. White gives back the pawn with the idea of creating a target for his attack to revolve around after he trades off some of the minor pieces.} cxd6 {White gets the target like he wanted.} 22. Bxg7 Nxg7 {It would seem that capturing with the Rook is better because now it's blocked again, and effectively useless.} 23. Ne4 {Attacking the target on d6. Now if 24. ...d5 then the Knight goes to f6 with check, winning the pawn.} Nf5 {A fatal error! This allows White to get a tremendous fork!} 24. Qd5+ Rf7 25. Qxa8 Ne3 26. Rde1 Nc4 {This defends against Nxd6 winning a pawn after Qxd6 Qxc8 .} 27. Qd5 {This move is super-efficient: It pins and attacks at the same time! It will allow for Ng5, winning the exchange.} b5 28. b3 {Oh no! White missed it! And after Bd7 White's Queen is forced to move into a less than ideal position.} Bb7 29. Qxd6 {Has White completely lost his mind!?!? After Qe6 White is quite alright, but this is suicide...} Nxd6 30. Nxd6 Qxd6 {Now White must play conservatively, he's only a pawn down, and must be sure to hold on to that. He also should try to avoid trades.} 31. Re2 Qa3+ 32. Kb1 a5 {Black attempts to break open White's castle.} 33. Re3 b4 {What is this? Black has taken all of the squares away from his Queen and severely weakened his attack! Maybe there's some hope for White after all!} 34. Nb2 {White prepares to finish off the Black Queen.} Bd5 35. Rd1 Bb7 36. Nc4 Rg7 37. Nxa3 bxa3 {And White is firmly ahead again!} 38. Re2 Ba6 39. Red2 {White doubles his Rooks and prepares to force Black to trade off a pair of Rooks.} a4 40. Rd2d8+ {Here it goes, White is simplifying into a won endgame. Here are the final moves...} Kh7 41. Rd8d7 Be2 42. Rxg7+ Kxg7 43. Re1 {1-0}
