1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  This game starts off as a Reti but transposes into a Sicilian Naijdorf.  In the Naijdorf both players castle on opposite sides.  White on the queenside and black on the kingside.  Both sides are going for the jugular and it is a race to mate.  Will Glenda still be a defender or will she win the race for me?  In order to find out you can either read the spoiler below or read on.} c5 2. e4 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - typical Sicilian type position.} Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {5. ..... a6 - this move characterises the Sicilian Naijorf.  Prepares a b5 onslaught should I go queenside.} 6. Be3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3 h5 {8. .... h5 tries to hold up any potential kingside mating attack.} 9. Qd2 Nbd7 10. O-O-O {10. 0-0-0 - so Henry goes queenside - but is he playing with fire?!  We shall see.} Be7 11. Kb1 b5 12. Bd3 Qc7 13. h3 O-O 14. g4 {14. g4 - over the last few moves both sides have been clearing their decks and preparing to pawn storm each other's castled positions.  I am playing to open up the g and h column.} b4 15. Ne2 a5 16. Rdg1 {16. Rdg1 - I mean business!} a4 17. Nbc1 b3 18. cxb3 axb3 19. a3 {19. a3 - jo-blocking off the b column.} d5 20. gxh5 d4 21. Bh6 {21. Bh6 - Fou Lenoir leads the charge.  The threat is Rxg7 with a pile on along the g column.} Nxh5 22. Ng3 Nf4 23. Nf5 {23. Nf5 - black has tried to foil Rxg7 but I renew my threat and the pin on the g file.} Bxf5 24. exf5 Nxd3 25. Nxd3 {25. Nxd3 - N for B trade.} Bf6 26. Rgc1 {26. Rc1 - to prevent the BQ from any counter threats along the c column - next move she creates an annoyance elsewhere.} Qb7 27. Qg2 {27. Qg2 - protecting the doubled and isolated f pawn and renewing the pin along the g file.  I am now threatening Rhg1 for a decisive double up on the g column.} Kh8 28. Bd2 Qb5 29. Nb4 {29. Nb4 - prevents a nasty queen check on d3.} Nc5 30. Bg5 Nd3 {30. .... Nd3? - menaces my rook but really that knight should have retreated to d7 to back up f6.  Fou Lenoir now exploits this error with a threat of mate.} 31. Bxf6 gxf6 32. Qg4 {32. Qg4 - Now threatening mate on g1.  Black tries to foil this but.....} Rfg8 33. Qh4+ Kg7 34. Rcg1+ Kf8 35. Rxg8+ Kxg8 36. Qh6 {36. Qh6 - trapping the BK on g8.} Nf4 37. Rg1+ Ng6 {37. .... Ng6 - in order to stave off the chessic Grim Reaper, Old Matey, black must now start losing material.} 38. fxg6 Qe2 {38. .... Qe2?? - allows mate in a few moves.} 39. g7 {39. g7 - of which I now announce to my opponent.  Black may only stave it off by sacrificing his queen.  But Qh8 mate is inevitable.  Black now waves the white flag and my rating goes back up to 1800+!  Nice.}
