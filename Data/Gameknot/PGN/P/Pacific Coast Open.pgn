[Opening "Sicilian (B22), Alapin's variation (2.c3)"]

1. e4 {In this game I was playing one of my close friends who was one of the leading 11 year olds in the country. This game had one of the greatest endgames ever. So i opened up with e4 which leads up to the most exciting positions in chess.} c5 {He played c5 which is Sicilian defense. This is the sharpest response to e4 in that it takes control a square in the centre. } 2. c3 {2. c3 This is the Alapin variation. I like this variation b/c it is never dangerous for white and you only get positions which are good for white or positions that are equal but have exciting dynamic tactics. I planned to take control of the centre with d4.} d5 {2... d5 Takes advantage of c3 because now the knight can't attack the queen with a tempo. } 3. exd5 {e5 gives black a slight advantage after Bf5, so this is the only move.} Qxd5 4. d4 {taking control of the centre.} Nf6 {This move develops a piece and is waiting for the way that white wants to develop.} 5. Nf3 {Developing a piece on a good square that takes control of the centre.} e6 {Also playable is Bg4, but in all variations dxc5 is good for white. e6 while blocking that bishop in lets the dark bishop develop. Also black's light bishop can develop on b7 controlling a powerful diagonal.} 6. Bd3 {Developing the bishop to target black's kingside. Also playable is the idea of Be2 and Na3. } Be7 {Preparing to castle quickly.} 7. O-O {Gets the king out of the centre and brings the rook into the game.} O-O {same idea that white has.} 8. Be3 {The way black played is annoying b/c I lost a tempo. usually people will play cxd4 early and my dark bishop will go to g5 immediately. At this tourney, I didn't consider the Be2 and Na3 variations.} cxd4 {This defends against the tactic dxc5 bxc5 Bxh7  Kxh7 Qxd5 Nxd5 Bxc5 which would win a pawn.} 9. cxd4 {This makes room for Nc3. The isolated d-pawn is double edged because it is an endgame weakness in most cases, but in the middle game it controls key squares like c5 and e5.} Nc6 {Nc6 develops his knight on a centre-controlling square. He is eying my isolated d-pawn now.} 10. Nc3 {Attacks the queen and develops with a tempo.} Qd8 {Gets the queen out of the attack. Personally I prefer Qd6 in this position.} 11. a3 {a3 prevents the idea black has of playing Nb4 and then Nbd5 which would be a strong post and an equalized position. a3 is the only chance for an advantage.} a6 {This move is dubious. He wants to play b5, but b5 doesn't control very much in these positions. I made this move look silly. In this position b6 was much better.} 12. Rc1 {Rc1! now b5 is impossible b/c of Nxb5 which wins a pawn. I develop this Rook and make room for the idea of Bb1 and Qd3.} b6 {he realized a6 was a waste move, but still needs to develop his bishop on b7.} 13. Bb1 {this move prepares Qd3 which launches an attack on the kingside. } Bb7 {Develops the bishop on a strong diagonal.} 14. Qd3 {I think this is a fundamental attacking move. Attacking players love this. I can play Bg5 attacking the knight which defends h7 and later on I have ideas like h4 also.} b5 {now that the tactic is defended of Nxb5 he can play the oh so (not) important b5.} 15. Ne4 {Tactically attacking. I'm threatening Nxf6  and if Nxe4 Qxe4, then I'm forking h7 and c6.} g6 {This is the only move that defends the tactic.} 16. Nc5 {Nc5!? This move is interesting. I want him to play Bxc5 dxc5 so I will have a passed pawn and a beautiful bishop pair. I'm threatening b7 also.} Na5 {He didn't want to play Bc8 which is horrid. This move is the best try for black.} 17. Nxb7 {Getting rid of his bishop so now I have the advantage of 2 bishops against a B N. In open positions like this, chess theory dictates that 2 bishops have an advantage.} Nxb7 {Duh. recaptures.} 18. Ne5 {Since the knight on c6 is gone he left e5 hanging which is a beautiful square for me to put my knight. I have the threat of Nc6.} Qd5 {Avoids the fork and prepares to bring the rooks to the centre files.} 19. Bg5 {Bg5 targets the f6 knight and now black's bishop is immobilized.} Rac8 {bringing the rook to the open file.} 20. Qd2 {Qd2 prepares Qf4! which would attack the knight again and if Qd8 then I would play Nc6 winning an exchange. Also the idea of Ng4 is possible} Nc5 {A tactically developing move. He saw the danger of Qf4 and brought his knight to the centre. } 21. dxc5 {Creates a passed pawn.} Qxe5 {This is the only move.} 22. Bf4 {Now that the knight is gone then there is no more threat of Nc6 so the knight is secure on f6 now. So Bf4 shifts to another diagonal. I only had about 30 minutes in this position. After I play b4 black will have no way of making progress.} Qd5 {Gets the Queen out of the way.} 23. b4 {Secures my passed pawn and since I was low on time, I gave my self the option of playing anything.} Qxd2 {Trades queens hoping for a drawish endgame.} 24. Bxd2 {The only move.} Nd5 {develops the knight in the centre and prepares to put his bishop on f6 which would control an awesome diagonal.} 25. Be4 {Puts the Bishop in the center and attacking the centralized knight. If he recaptures with the e pawn then my position will be winning.} Rfd8 {Defends the knight so the e-pawn doesn't have to recapture.} 26. Rc2 { I only had 10 minutes in this position and I wanted to make time control at 40 moves. I was afraid of Bf6 Bb2. And if I played Rfd1 Bf6 Rc2 then I was scared of Nc3! which wouldve won.} Bf6 {Takes control on a strong diagonal. } 27. Rb1 {It has the hidden idea of g3 followed by Bg2 Bf1 and a4.} Rc7 28. Rbc1 {I was desperately trying to make time control here with less than 5 minutes on my clock. I knew there was no danger except for Rd1 so I just made a move.} Rc6 {Stops the progress of my c-pawn.} 29. Kf1 {Another quick move, this move has the purpose of bringing my king to the center. In the endgame the king is an attacking piece worth almost as much as a rook.} Kg7 30. Ke2 h6 31. Rd1 {Black has nothing here. He is making pointless moves, but he has nothing he can do to make progress.} Rc7 32. g3 {This move has the idea of Bf4 also the idea of dropping the bishop back to g2 if I have to. } Rcd7 {Doubling the rooks on the d-file. This move is bad because I that white can win with precise play here.} 33. c6 {Finally c6! making progress with a tempo.} Rc7 {Rc7 is forced b/c if Rd6 then the variation is winning after c7 Rc8 Bxd5 Rxd5 Be3 with the idea of Bb6 and bringing my rook to d8.} 34. Bxd5 {I take the knight anyway with the same idea. } exd5 {If Rxd5 then I had Bf4 and if he played Rxd1 then I had Bxc7!! totally winning.} 35. Bf4 {Planning on the crushing c7.} Rcc8 {Only move. Re7  would lose the d-pawn for free.} 36. c7 {Making progress on the passed pawn.} Rd7 {Putting pressure on my passed pawn. Black has the threat o g5 here which would win the pawn.} 37. Rc6 {I'm defending against g5 b/c I would have Bd6 and also I am threatening a6. So this is a prophylactic move.} Re7+ {The idea to limit the range of my dark square bishop after Be5.} 38. Kf3 {Bringing my king into play.} Be5 {Blocks my Bishop.} 39. Rxd5 {!! Now I just won a pawn, and I have Rxa6 next move. I had this variation calculated since move 30. So now my analysis has to take a new route.} Bxf4 {Preparing to take the c-pawn. } 40. gxf4 {gxf4! I realized that my kingside pawn structure had no meaning and if I played Kxf4 then he would have Re2 later on.} Rcxc7 {Preparing for the next move.} 41. Rxa6 {Take a free pwn.} Rca7 {Ra7 an interesting move b/c if I take it then he will have a drawish position.} 42. Rdd6 {Giving support to my rook. The only move that gives me chances.} Red7 {A pointless move. White is winning now.} 43. Ke4 {Ke4! now my king is going to capture his b5 pwn soon.} h5 {Trying to make progress on the kingside. } 44. h4 {When I played h4 I played it b/c I was worried about Re7  Kd5 (Kf3 would be dubious) Re2 followed by Rxf2 and Rxh2. It takes him an extra move to make way for his h-pawn now.} Rde7+ {Following through, this is the only way black can draw, but this is not drawn.} 45. Kd4 {Kd4 is the same as Kd5, but I hadn't thoroughly analyze the variation of Re2 f3, B/c if it was necessary I wanted to play Ke3. The rest of this game is pretty much forced. You should pay attention for this complicated endgame.} Rxa6 {Preparing for the pawn massacre after Re2 but I don't care.} 46. Rxa6 {only Move.} Re2 {The purpose of Rxa6} 47. Kc5 {In this ending, the being down a pawn doesn't mean anything if you can promote faster.} Rxf2 {Preparing for Rxf4 and Rxh4 making room for the passed pawn.} 48. Kxb5 {only move.} Rxf4 {Only move.} 49. Rc6 {White had a lot of options, but this is the only winning one. The idea of Rc6 is to make room for the passed a-pawn and also to swing my rook around to behind my a-pawn. If his rook got behind it then my promotion would take a bit longer and he will catch up/.} Rxh4 {The final pawn in the way of his progress.} 50. Rc1 {there it is. White is completely winning now b/c if black tries Rh2 then I have Ra1!. } Rg4 {He wanted to make room for his pawn as fast as possible.} 51. a4 {Beginning of the end.} h4 {trying to race me.} 52. a5 {forced} h3 {forced } 53. a6 {forced.} h2 {only move.} 54. Rh1 {Rh1 is totally winning.} Rg2 {wants to guard the pawn and have Ra2 stopping my pawn from promoting and then play g5 g4 g3 g2 crushing. Unfortunately for him  this play takes too long.} 55. a7 {Accurate moves win the game.} Ra2 {So he has to stop my queen from promoting with his rook.} 56. Kb6 {A quiet move which secures victory.} g5 {starting his idea. This position is dangerous for white if I missed my move then this could've happened. Kb7 g4 a8=Q Rxa8 Kxa8 g3!! totally winning for black.} 57. Rxh2 {Too bad for him I had a tactic, he cannot recapture with the rook b/c I will queen. If he doesn't take then I now have Kb7 winning.} Rxh2 {He took it. He thought this was the only chance here b/c he has a R  2 passed pawns against my queen   pawn.} 58. a8=Q {Forced.} Kg6 {This position is resignable on my analysis but if I was a total fish then I might let him get his 2 pawns to the end of the board.} 59. Qe4+ {Qe4 ! if he plays Kg7 then I have Qe5  winning the rook. He loses the rook by force here. If Kh5 then Qh7!. } f5 {Hoping to save his rook.} 60. Qe8+ {He loses his rook for sure. If Kh6 Qh8 , or if Kg7 Qe5 . if Kh7 then I have Qd7  Kg8 (Kg6 Qd6 ) Qc8  Kg7 Qc7 . If he plays Kf6 hen I have Qc6  followed by Qc7 . This game proves that a carefully calculated endgame can lead to a brilliant win.}
