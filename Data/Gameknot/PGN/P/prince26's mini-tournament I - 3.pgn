1. e4 c5 {when I face a player at that level, I avoid e5.} 2. d3 Nc6 3. Nf3 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 {without the d4 move, I decided to go fianchetto} 5. Bd2 d6 6. h3 e6 7. Be2 Nge7 8. O-O O-O 9. a3 a6 10. Be3 Bd7 {10 moves without any contact...} 11. d4 {first contact} cxd4 12. Nxd4 Qc7 13. Qd2 {mk is still very precautionous. We are both very calm players} Ne5 {my idea was to point on c3. I must admit my knight was an obstacle.} 14. Nf3 Nxf3+ {but mk decided to help me, here.} 15. Bxf3 Bxc3 {I never hesitate to give my bishop for pawns doubled} 16. bxc3 {For me this was a very good position, as white have three pawns structures and two are not good. My pawns structures are really good.} Rac8 17. Rab1 {Of course not Bd4, cause of e5} Bb5 {I refused Qxc3 18. Qxc3 Rxc3 19. Rxb7 as I lose the good structure of my pawns and white has the initiative.} 18. Rfd1 {good counter-attack} Rfd8 19. Rb3 d5 {of course not Ba4 followed by the Deadly Bb6} 20. exd5 {i thought white 'd played e5. } Nxd5 {last officer on board!} 21. Bxd5 {almost necessary} Rxd5 {all the opened columns are mine.} 22. Qe1 Rxd1 23. Qxd1 Ba4 {black answered after that very correctly, until...} 24. Bb6 Qc6 25. Rb4 Bb5 26. Bd4 Rd8 27. Qg4 Qd5 28. a4 Bc6 29. h4 {... this} f5 {my surprise. I really checked a long time on this. My bet was on advancing f and e pawns and profit on any mistake by white. Of course, white threatens rapidly mate in g7 if I let the queen go there, but for now white must Watch g2, also threatened by mate. I really believed mk was surprised here.} 30. Qg5 f4 {white cannot take f4 and is not willing to exchange queen, as my pawn structure is still much better.} 31. Qg4 e5 {"get back!  Get back to where you once belong"} 32. Bb6 {or get front...} Re8 33. h5 {here is his surprise :-)} Re6 {but ok: he can't let me take back Rg6.} 34. h6 {new threat in case his queen get on 7th line or diagonale a1-h8} Kf7 {protecting the rook and getting to center} 35. a5 {free the rook from defense} f3 {I had this in mind for a long time. My goal is not to take back f3, but to go on the first line with Queenie...} 36. gxf3 Qd1+ {here i am! Now the first on f3 is my bisphop!} 37. Kg2 {protecting f3} Rf6 {attacking a third time and threatening mate.} 38. Qc4+ {and... i didn't see it coming!!!!! congrats to mk!} Ke7 {no panic... no repetitive moves} 39. Bc5+ {better than Qc5+} Kd7 40. Qd3+ {best and only move.} Qxd3 41. cxd3 {structure is better now} Rxf3 42. Kh2 {good choice} Rxd3 {better than taking f2: white has once again bad pawn structures.} 43. f4 e4 {i didn't want white rook on f4} 44. Rd4+ {Not again!  and on the same place! But this time i am not forced to exchange} Ke6 45. Rxd3 exd3 {my structure is much better, but we have opposite bishops... and that is a possibility of a draw} 46. Be3 Kf5 47. Kg3 {damn! I cannot pass!} Ke4 48. Kf2 Kd5 49. Kg3 Kc4 {I must say i Underestimate the calculation, here.} 50. Bd2 Kb5 51. Kh4 {the run started} Kxa5 52. Kg5 Kb5 53. Kf6 a5 54. Kg7 a4 55. Kxh7 a3 56. Kg7 {much better than Kxg6, exposing the king to the future queen! excellent!} a2 57. h7 a1=Q 58. h8=Q {both on track! Who's in front? I believed it was me.} Qb2 {as i could not check, i decided to Attack the bishop} 59. Qh2 Be4 {g6 was still unprotected} 60. Qf2 Bf5 {to be safer} 61. Qg2 Ka6 62. Kh6 Qa3 63. c4 Qf8+ {a plan to exchange the queens} 64. Kg5 Qe7+ 65. Kh6 Qe2 {exchange!} 66. Qd5 {but no!!!! he does not want!} Qxd2 67. Qb5+ {and now the run to draw} Ka7 68. Qc5+ Kb8 69. Qd6+ Kc8 70. Qf8+ Kc7 71. Qc5+ Kb8 72. Qd6+ Ka7 73. Qc5+ b6 {I believed I found the clue...} 74. Qc7+ Ka6 75. c5 Qh2+ 76. Kg7 Qb2+ {and now i can protect my king} 77. Kh6 bxc5 78. Qd6+ Qb6 {white resigend... thanks mk for this very nice game. I studied a lot!}
