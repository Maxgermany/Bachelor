1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. d4 e5 4. Be3 {An odd way to go on...} Bb4+ {Just to avoid Nc3, or exchange it. } 5. c3 Bd6 6. c4 Qa5+ 7. Nc3 Nc6 8. c5 exd4 9. Bxd4 Bxc5 {A lot of theory and tactic involved, up to here. I lost, with this move, because of Bxg7. I could have played Qb6, but no use. Qe2+, defending it, and I was lost. } 10. Qe2+ Be6 11. Bxc5 {Again, he didn't see it. } Qxc5 12. Rd1 {Interesting position. I have a pawn, but a very cramped position, even if not without possibilities. } Nge7 13. Nf3 O-O {I don't like to castle, but in this situation, it was almost a suicide to go on without doing it. } 14. g3 Rfe8 15. Bg2 Bg4 {With a lot of threats. } 16. Ne4 Qa5+ 17. Kf1 {The best - and good - way out!} Nf5 18. h3 Nfd4 19. Qd3 Bxf3 20. Bxf3 Nxf3 21. Qxf3 {Not the best from my pinning position...} Qa4 22. Nc3 Qc4+ 23. Kg2 {And the king is castled!} Re6 {Trying something different. } 24. Rhe1 Rf6 25. Qh5 h6 {To get a breath for my king, just in case.} 26. Ne4 Rg6 27. Nc3 {None of us has a clear plan yet. } Nb4 28. Re4 Qc6 {Pinning again!} 29. Qe2 Na6 {I cannot have my pieces coordinated. } 30. f3 Nc5 31. Re3 {He didn't consider Rc4, probably because of b5.} Ne6 {Threatening Nf4+, due to another pin.} 32. Kh2 f5 {Desperately seeking for an attack. } 33. Nd5 Kf7 {To avoid strange checks by the knight, and providing an extra support to the knight, just in case. Of course it is a dangerous move...} 34. Rc3 Qd6 {Played confidently.} 35. Nxc7 {He allows me to...} Qxg3+ 36. Kh1 {And now? Nf4 was the move, but Qh2... and I had nothing. } Qxh3+ 37. Qh2 Qxh2+ 38. Kxh2 Nxc7 39. Rxc7+ {A +2 engame is not bad... well, +1!} Kg8 40. Rxb7 Re8 41. Rd2 {Wisely.} a6 {f4 was the right move. } 42. Rg2 Rxg2+ 43. Kxg2 Re2+ 44. Kg3 {Now is technique... something I don't have. } Kh7 45. Kf4 Rf2 46. Rb6 g5+ {Trying to simplyfy, but it was a mistake The king gets separated from his pawns. } 47. Kxf5 Rxf3+ 48. Kg4 Rf2 49. Kh5 Rh2+ 50. Kg4 Rh4+ 51. Kf5 Rf4+ 52. Ke5 Ra4 53. a3 g4 54. Kf5 h5 55. Kg5 {Now, g3, and I win? Rb7+, Kg8, Kh6, threatens mate... and my pawn is caught. } Ra5+ 56. Kh4 Ra4 {A blunder. } 57. Kxh5 g3 58. Rb7+ Kg8 59. Rb8+ Kf7 60. Rb7+ Kf6 61. Rb6+ Kf5 62. Rg6 Kf4 {He helped me letting my king out, but I blundered again } 63. Rg4+ Kf3 64. Rxa4 {Game over. This happens to me for not to study finals theory.} g2 65. Rg4 Kf2 66. Kg5 {}
