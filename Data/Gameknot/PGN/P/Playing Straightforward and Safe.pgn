[Opening "French (C11), Burn variation"]

1. e4 e6 {The French defence, I haven't been playing it long, but IM John Watson gave me a good idea on how to play it in his lectures on ICC.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 {Not liking having to trade off my good bishop with the winawar variation (3... Bb4) I've decided to play more simple, straightforward lines.} 4. Bg5 {Surprisingly, this was the first time I have met this move, which is the most popular, just ahead of 4. e5} dxe4 5. Nxe4 Be7 6. Bxf6 gxf6 {This is all normal stuff, we're sticking to the books for now.} 7. Nf3 b6 8. Bc4 Bb7 9. Qe2 {A move with two purposes. 1: Protect the attacked e4 knight. 2: Prepare to castle queenside. With the g-file open, castling short may not be the right choice.} c6 {Although this looks just plain bad, blocking in the LSB (Light-squared Bishop) this move is played to allow the development of the queen to c7, followed by castling long.} 10. O-O-O Qc7 11. Kb1 Nd7 12. Rhe1 O-O-O 13. Ba6 Rhg8 {And with this simple move, we are finally out of the books, and left to our own accord.} 14. g3 f5 15. Ned2 f4 {I decide to try and make something happen, and it wasn't actually too bad of a choice.} 16. Bxb7+ Kxb7 17. Nc4 {Aiming for e5.} b5 {Might as well give him a bit of encouragement, right?} 18. Nce5 Nxe5 19. Nxe5 fxg3 20. hxg3 Bf6 21. Nf3 h5 22. Reh1 Rgh8 23. c3 {Solid, very solid.} h4 {And here's my temporary pawn sacrifice. The computer analysis considers this move an inaccuracy, but I'm not a computer, and neither is my opponent, so lets have some fun.} 24. Nxh4 Bxh4 25. Rxh4 Rxh4 26. gxh4 Qf4 {This endgame should actually be drawn, but black seems to come out with more piece activity.} 27. Rh1 {Also playable was 27. h5.} Qf5+ 28. Kc1 Rg8 {Preparing to attack the two isolated pawns. The rook and queen combine quite nicely to take down them down.} 29. f3 Rg3 30. Qe4 Qh5 31. Rf1 Qh6+ {! A nice little in-between check, which, without looking too deeply into it, forces f4.} 32. f4 Qxh4 {The material is equal once again, but it won't be so for long.} 33. Rh1 {The computer considers this an inaccuracy, preferring 33. Qe5.} Qg4 34. Rf1 a5 {I start advancing my queenside pawns.} 35. a4 {He temporarily stops further advancing of my pawns, but this move is not the best, the sacrifice is unnecessary.} bxa4 36. Qe5 Qf5 {I would be very happy to exchange queens, and it looks like the best option for white as well.} 37. Qxf5 exf5 38. Kb1 a3 {! Freeing my queenside pawns once again, and with my opponents next move, I get an outside passed pawn.} 39. Ka2 axb2 40. Kxb2 Kb6 {Following simple rules: In endgames, get your king to the centre, as it is a strong attacking and defending piece, worth about a knight.} 41. Re1 Rf3 {And with this move, my position looks completely winning, and my opponent helps me along with a small mistake.} 42. Re5 {? The best try was 42. Re7 which at least won a pawn.} Rxf4 43. Kb3 {I thought my opponent was planning to play 44. Ka4 but I soon realised I was wrong.} Rf1 {! A nice move. At first I thought after 44. Ka4 I would play 44... Ra1+ and then 45... f4 but there's no need. After 44. Ka4 I can simply play 44... f4 where 45. Rxa5 loses to 45... Ra1+ winning the rook.} 44. Kc4 {So instead he decides to come to the centre.} f4 {My plan is simple and effective: Push both pawns to victory, and it worked.} 45. Rf5 f3 46. d5 cxd5+ 47. Rxd5 f2 {I should say that with this move the king is held to the c-file because of the protection from the c-pawn. For example:  48. Rf5 a4 49. Kb4? loses to 49... Rb1+ where the pawn queens.} 48. Rf5 a4 49. Rxf7 {If white wanted to linger alive for another move or two, he might've checked first.} a3 50. Rf6+ Kc7 {And here my opponent resigns. His position really is hopeless, I will advance my a-pawn safely, and if white tries to stop it with 51. Kb3 Rb1+ wins. Thanks Goldenknights for the game, I really enjoyed playing it, and I hoped everyone enjoyed watching it.}
