[Opening "Caro-Kann (B13), Panov-Botvinnik attack"]

1. e4 c6 {The caro-kann, my favourite defense to the king-pawn opening} 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 {This is my least favourite variation, the Panov Attack} Nf6 5. Nc3 Bf5 6. Qb3 {My last move was dubious, as this move demonstrates. If I play b6 here, c6 will be weak.} dxc4 {If White plays Qxb7 here, I'd respond with Nbd7, the only move.} 7. Bxc4 {This forces e6.} e6 8. Qxb7 Nbd7 9. Nf3 Be7 10. O-O O-O {So I'm down a pawn, but White has an isolated d-pawn.} 11. Qa6 Nb6 12. Bb3 Ne4 13. Re1 Nxc3 14. bxc3 {Now White has hanging pawns, with the c-pawn being backward.} Qc7 {If the white Queen weren't on a6, I'd play Rc8.} 15. Bd2 Nd5 {Thank god the bishop on e7 will still be defended by the queen after the e-file opens.} 16. Bxd5 exd5 17. Ne5 f6 18. Qc6 {Here, I should have played Qd8! and the knight will have to return to f3.} Bd6 19. Qxc7 Bxc7 20. Nc6 Bd6 21. Ne7+ Bxe7 22. Rxe7 {Now White has a rook on the 7th rank, which means trouble for Black. However, Black has defensive resources.} Rf7 23. Rae1 Be4 {breaking communication} 24. Rxf7 Kxf7 25. f3 Bd3 26. Re3 Bc4 27. a3 {White's a-pawn is easy prey.} Rb8 28. Be1 {If Bc1, the Rb1, followed by Rb3.} Rb3 29. a4 Ra3 {If } 30. Bg3 Rxa4 {Black's a-pawn is now passed and hence dangerous.} 31. Bd6 Ra2 32. Re7+ Kg6 33. h4 h5 34. Rc7 a5 35. Bf8 Kf5 {Saves a tempo} 36. Bxg7 a4 37. Bf8 a3 38. Ra7 Ra1+ {Lucky for me, the White king is still on the first rank.} 39. Kh2 a2 40. Bb4 Rb1 41. Rg7 a1=Q {It's about time to resign, my friend.} 42. g4+ {No, there is no checkmate for you, my friend.} hxg4 43. fxg4+ Kf4 44. Bd6+ Kf3 {Now Black has mate in one - either Rh1#, Qb2#, or Qa2#. White can't prevent all three, so ... he resigns.}
