1. e4 {KPO} c6 {CKD} 2. Nf3 {KN comes out} d5 {Occupation of center.} 3. d3 {Weak. Nc3 is better} dxe4 4. dxe4 Qxd1+ 5. Kxd1 {W lost castling right} Bg4 {Pin} 6. Be2 {Unpin} Nd7 {Clearing the way for long castle} 7. Bf4 {Developing move} Ngf6 {Attack} 8. Nc3 {Defense} e6 {Opening the diagonal for B} 9. h3 Bxf3 {If ...Bh4 he can move g4. At g6 my B would not be very effective} 10. Bxf3 Bb4 {Development} 11. Ke2 {Connecting the major peices} O-O-O {Joining the Rs and placing a R on open file another nice move is BxN} 12. Rhd1 Nc5 {Threatening the P} 13. e5 Bxc3 14. bxc3 {White has very weak Q side Should have done something to avoid this breakup} Nd5 {Double attack} 15. Bd2 {Although W has 2 Bs but deployment of dark knights is far better} Na4 {Idea is to win an exchange} 16. Bxd5 Rxd5 {R develops with attack} 17. f4 Rc5 {c3P is doomed.} 18. Kf2 Nxc3 19. Bxc3 Rxc3 {Blk wins material plus more positional advantage} 20. Rd2 Rd8 {Blk wants to exchange peices} 21. Rad1 {This allows a small tactic. 21 RxR KxR Rc1 (Rd1 and Rd2) is a possibility but its looks like W cant save the game.} Rxc2 22. Ke1 {Mistake. Should have played RxR} Rdxd2 23. Rxd2 Rxd2 24. Kxd2 {Position is simplified. W has no advantage no counter no compensation} b5 {Advancing and stopping a4 Kc7 or Kd7 or c5 are alternatives} 25. Kd3 c5 {Stopping the K. W resigned. Blk is winning very easily.}
