1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. Qxd4 Nf6 4. Qd1 {Fritz had no comment on this move, but even if White is ultimately going to retreat the queen home the move makes sense only when compelled as the queen exerts significant influence in the center of the board.} Nc6 {The only real advantage of the early retreat is it leaves black unsure of how white will setup his pieces, but black already seems equal to me.} 5. Bd3 g6 6. Bg5 Bg7 {Indeed if we look at development, black has placed three minor pieces while white has placed 2 and a pawn, but the development is far from equal.  Black's pieces are well placed where they are.  White's bishops will move.  White is getting farther behind in development.  In essence black is calling Bg5 as nothing more than bluff and bluster.  He says, "Yes, please!  I want that diagonal."  Should black foolishly play e6 or e5, then the move becomes powerful, but white did nothing to induce either move.} 7. Bd2 {There are some times when Fritz is excellent, but here Fritz offers, "Black has a cramped position. Black's piece can't move: c8."  The bishop is not free to move, but neither is a1 or h1.  The black position is very dynamic and surely that is enough compensation for a cramped bishop. } O-O {Fritz offers the note to white's previous move as 7. Nc3 d5.  On some level, Fritz must understand that this move wastes time and is not worth the payoff.} 8. Bc3 {Even if successful, white will trade a thrice moved bishop for black's once moved bishop.  At worst, he will cede the diagonal while shedding one of his two developed pieces for the once moved knight.} d5 {And black mischeiviously gives white a glimmer of hope that his plan has merit.} 9. exd5 Qxd5 {Worth a '!'} 10. Nf3 {Perhaps somewhat unusual: the center has no pawns to influence play.} a5 {Fritz gives the alternative variation: 10... e5 as a clearance sacrifice to which Fritz does not believe black will bite: 11. Be2 Qxd1+ 12. Bxd1 Nd5 } 11. Nbd2 b5 12. O-O {Fritz : "White castles and improves king safety."  Elementary but true.  10...a5 and 11...b5 are good moves where one, or both, deserves an '!'. } b4 {The black threat has teeth.  Black is superior, and owing to the lack of an escape square, white will lose influence on dark squares.} 13. Bc4 {Black owns e4 preventing Be4 with exclamation.} Qd8 14. Bxf6 {Worth the think:  14.Bb5 bxc3 15.Bxc6 cxb2! 16.Rb1 (White has no appetite for 16.Bxa8 because it invites 16...bxa1=Q! when black injects panic into the white position) and white gets at least a file for the diagonal.} Bxf6 {Black has the pair of bishops.  Given how solid black seems, I have to think the note to white's last move may be superior as black's play is not nearly so clear.} 15. Rb1 {Defensive but right: 15...Bxb2 16.Rb1 Bc3!, and Black can aim to increase pressure on the d file.} Bb7 16. Be2 {Fritz' alternate variation: 16. Ne4 Ne5 17. Nxf6+ exf6 18. Nxe5 fxe5 } Nd4 17. Nxd4 Qxd4 18. Bf3 Bxf3 19. Nxf3 Qxd1 20. Rfxd1 {Fritz' alternative variation: 20. Rbxd1 Bxb2 21. Rfe1 e6 } Rad8 21. Rxd8 Rxd8 22. g3 g5 23. Kg2 {Fritz' alternate: 23. h3 gives the king extra air and prevents g4. } g4 24. Ne1 Rd2 25. b3 {Fritz: 25. h3 h5 26. hxg4 hxg4 27. c3 bxc3 28. bxc3 Rxa2 29. Rb3} Bd4 26. h3 {And Fritz no longer likes h3: 26. Nd3 e5 27. Rf1  } Rxf2+ 27. Kh1 gxh3 28. Nd3 {And he accepts the move two moves too late.} Rxc2 29. Nf4 Be5 30. Nxh3 Bxg3 31. Ng5 f5 {Fritz: "Alternative variation: 31... Bf4 keeps an even firmer grip 32. Nf3 Rxa2 33. Ne1" } 32. Nf3 {I sometimes enjoy the added pinache to Fritz' commentary: 32. Rf1 doesn't get the bull off the ice.  32...Kg7 33. Rf3 Bc7} f4 {Fritz: This might be a shorter path : 32... Rf2 33. Ng5 h6 34. Ne6 } 33. Ra1 {33. Rd1 does not improve anything.  33...Rxa2 34. Nd2 h5} Re2 {The move played is strong, but is Fritz' 33... Rf2 stronger?  Fritz says it "keeps an even firmer grip" because of 34. Nd4 f3 35. Nxf3 Rxf3 36. Rd1 Rxa2 but I can see no reason to offer the pawn on f3.  e5 and the subsequent e4 will kick the knight and then f3 is not only obvious, it isn't compensation at all.  Perhaps the compensation that Fritz sees involves the capture on a2 which is reasonable, but it aims at an endgame when black's material advantage screams attack and the e and f pawns will be well suited for an endgame should it come to that.} 34. a3 {"34. Nd4"? "a fruitless try to alter the course of the game: Rh2+ 35. Kg1 h5" } Re3 {I agree with Fritz' evaluation here largely because it is the idea I eventually found in the game: e5} 35. Nd4 {34.e5 would have constrained this.  "35. Kg2 doesn't improve anything: h5 36. axb4 axb4"} e5 36. Nc6 {"36. Nf5 is not the saving move: Rxb3 37. axb4 axb4"} Rxb3 {"36... a4 and Black wins: 37. Ne7+ Kf7 38. Nf5 Re1+ 39. Rxe1 Bxe1 40. Nd6+ Kf6 41. Nc4," but black is crushing already.  It's simply about whether white takes the express or the scenic route now. } 37. axb4 axb4 38. Nxe5 h5 39. Kg2 h4 40. Ng4 {"40. Rf1 does not win a prize" because "Re3 41. Nc4 Rc3," but I think Fritz underestimates the power of 41.Nxe3 when black has his king out of play and white gets excellent compensation for the knight. } Kf7 {"40... f3+ and Black can already relax: 41. Kh3 Be1 42. Nf6+ Kf7 43. Ne4" } 41. Ra2 {"41. Kh3 does not save the day: f3."  Even Fritz' evaluations are trending towards single move responses.} Ke6 {Once again 41... f3+ "makes it even easier for Black" with "42. Kh3 f2 43. Nxf2 Bxf2+ 44. Kg4" } 42. Re2+ {42. Nh2 "cannot change destiny" as "Ra3 43. Rb2 b3" shows. } Kd5 {42... Kf5 "seems even better" and I did consider it but I thought the knight's position was more sound with Re5+ to follow, but black can back the king off of defensive duty to the pooor knight; harrassment is white's only option. } 43. Nf6+ Kd4 44. Nd7 {praying for a miracle: 44. Re4+ Kd3 45. Re7 } Re3 {Fritz' 44... f3+ delivers a nasty promotion: 45. Kh3 fxe2 46. Kg4 e1=Q 47. Nc5 Qe2+ 48. Kg5 Qe7+ 49. Kg6 Qe8+ 50. Kg5 Bf4+ 51. Kf6 Be5+ 52. Kf5 Qf7+ 53. Kg5 Rg3+ 54. Kxh4 Qh7# } 45. Rb2 b3 46. Nf8 f3+ 47. Kf1 {47. Kh3 "cannot change what is in store" but it is the only move as the next move illustrates.  47.Kh3 might continue "f2 48. Ne6+ Ke5 49. Rb1 Re1 50. Rxe1+ fxe1=Q 51. Kg4 Qe4+ 52. Nf4 Qxf4+ 53. Kh5 Qf7+ 54. Kg5 b2 55. Kg4 Qf5#" in the world according to Fritz. } Re1# {And a nice bishop and rook mating pattern.}
