1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {The Petroff defence.} 3. Nc3 Nc6 {Transposes into the four knights game.} 4. Bb5 Bb4 5. a3 {White prods my bishop with a pawn.} Bxc3 {I trade...} 6. dxc3 {White recaptures with his d2 pawn. I think it might have been better to capture with the b2 pawn instead, since white's centre may later be weakened by the absence of centrl pawns? Although capturing with the d2 pawn does open up the c1-h6 diagonal for whites bishop...} O-O {I castle kingside.} 7. Bxc6 {White captures the knight on c6.} dxc6 {I recapture with the pawn on d7. This capture takes one of black's pawns away from the centre, not towards it. Now there should be a struggle for control of the open d file...} 8. Bg5 {Win pins my knight...} Qxd1+ {...but the pin is only temporary.} 9. Rxd1 {White recaptures with his rook, seizing control of the open d file.} Nxe4 {My knight, no longer pinned, captures white's pawn on e4. But I have given white the d file. Was this worth it? d8 looks pretty weak for me now - white's rook and bishop are both staring straight at it.} 10. O-O {White castles.} f6 {I defend the pawn on e5 and threaten white's bishop.} 11. Be3 {White moves his bishop out of harm's way.} Be6 {I develop my  bishop, and connect my rooks on the back rank.} 12. h3 {This prevents white's knight being pinned by Bg4... I think this was a bit of a waste of a move though - I'd just played Be6 the move before - if I'd wanted to play Bg4 I'd have done it already. Rd3 or might have been better - preparing to double rooks on the d file.} b6 {I try to control the c5 square more solidly than just covering it with the knight. White's bishop now has very few squares. But perhaps moving a rook to d8 straight away is better?} 13. Nd2 {Attacking my knight, but closing the d-file.} Nd6 {I don't swap - since this allows white to take back with his rook, and he could then double his rooks on the d file on his next move. Moving my knight to c5 would not be good - white could swap his inactive bishop for my active knight, and I'd have tripled pawns after recapturing!} 14. b3 {White starts to take squares away from my white bishop and my knight.} Rfd8 {I take advantage of the d file (previously controlled by white) now being closed and move a rook to it. Next time it time if opens up, white will not have control as before.} 15. f4 {White attacks my pawn on e5.} e4 {I simply push my pawn to e4, creating a passed pawn, which soon becomes a serious problem for white.} 16. Nc4 {I don't quite understand this move. If white captures my knight, I can just recapture with my pawn on d7, un-doubling my pawns and improving my centre. It also gives me the chance to win another pawn with ...Nxd4, 17. bxd4, Bxd4.} f5 {Instead of winning an extra pawn with the exchange, I defend my pawn on e4. This may have been a mistake, since it creates a nice outpost for white's knight on e5.} 17. Ne5 {...white thinks that e5 is a good spot for his knight too! } c5 {I advance another pawn, taking away a square from white's bishop.} 18. Nc6 {White hits my rook. } Rde8 {I move off the d file. Although I'd have preferred to keep the rook on the d file, Rd7 isn't good, since white just moves his knight back to e5, threatening it again.} 19. c4 {White takes a square away from my bishop,} a5 {I start to push my pawns - white has a lot of control on the d file if it opens up, so I want to try to open up another file somewhere else that white can't control.} 20. Ne5 {White moves his knight back to a safe outpost.} a4 {Forcing a way through white's pawns on the a or b file... If white uses his rook to defend his queenside then he'll have to use the rook that is currently controlling the d-file.} 21. b4 {This move is a mistake: (1) It allows me to create a passed pawn. (2) White's pawn on c4 is attacked twice and defended once. I can win a pawn.} cxb4 {I capture the pawn on b4 - if white recaptures with axb4 then I have a passed pawn supported by my rook on the a-file.} 22. axb4 {White recaptures - giving me a passed pawn.} Nxc4 {I win another pawn...} 23. Nxc4 {White chooses to swap knights.} Bxc4 {I recapture with my bishop.} 24. Rf2 {White lifts a rook, perhaps preparing to double rooks on the d-file. } Rad8 {I'm not sure if leaving my passed pawn undefended was a great idea - but it can be easily supported by playing b5...} 25. Rxd8 {I think white made a mistake by accepting the exchange of rooks like this - when I recapture, I have control of the d file.} Rxd8 {I recapture with my rook. Now I own the d file...} 26. c3 {White supports his undefended pawn. ...Rd3 wins at least a pawn for black here...} Rd1+ {... but I went for a check instead, defending the back rank ready for my advancing pawn.} 27. Kh2 {White moves his king out of the way. Would rook f1 have been better? Once the rooks are swapped can white defend against the passed pawn on a4 with his bishop, and use his king to stop the pawn on e4?} a3 {I push my passed pawn - creating a serious problem for white.} 28. Bd4 {White doesn't have many options, but I don't think that this move helps. The c3 pawn is going nowhere, so it prevents white's bishop defending a1 from the advancing pawn.} a2 {I push my pawn again. White must now either lose a rook, or I promote my pawn to a queen.} 29. Rxa2 {White sacs his rook to prevent my pawn promotion.} Bxa2 {I grab the rook! White could probably resign here.} 30. g4 {White now has a siginificant material disadvantage. g3 may have been better here - since that does not lead to a further reduction in material on the board.} g6 {I don't swap pawns on g4 - this would leave e4 undefended.} 31. gxf5 {White takes my pawn on e5. It's generally better not to swap pieces or pawns when you are material down, so I'm not sure this is a good idea.} gxf5 {I recapture.} 32. Be5 {Defends f4 - but leaves a clear path for my pawn on e3...} e3 {I push my pawn on its last few steps to queendom...} 33. Bxc7 {White starts capturing my undefended pawns. Those pawns are no longer important in the game though. By doing this white gives up his last chance to stop my pawn on e3 queening. Bd4 would have been better, followed by Bf2, defending e1 from the pawn promotion threat.} e2 {I push my pawn again.} 34. Bxb6 {White grabs another pawn. Futile!} e1=Q {...I promote my pawn!} 35. Kg2 {White's king tries to flee...} Bd5+ {... but it's too late.  White lost by timeout at this point! The outcome would not have been any better for him had he played on though: 36. Kh2 is forced, followed by ...Rd2+ 37. Bf2, Kxf2++  Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed it. Please leave comments and give your star rating. }
