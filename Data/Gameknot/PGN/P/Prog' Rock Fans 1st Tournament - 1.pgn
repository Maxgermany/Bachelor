1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {Vienna game, at first glance this appears to be less aggresive than the more standard Nf3, but the point is that white has not given up the option of f4. black must play actively so as to not to end up in a bad line of the kings gambit.} Nf6 3. Bc4 Nc6 {this leads to a quiet game after 4.d3, a more exciting game occurs after 3...Nxe4 4.Nxe4 d5} 4. f4 {? i don't know to much about the vienna game but this just didn't seem right to me, 4.d3 is the mainline here} Nxe4 {now f4 seems like a wasted tempo} 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Qe2 {as good a way as any to keep the material balance.} dxc4 {much better than capturing the knight, black gains development and the bishop pair for free} 7. Qxc4 Be6 {gaining tempo on the exposed white queen} 8. Qc3 {? allowing black yet another tempo, Qf1 and Qe2 seem to be better and more natural than this} Bb4 9. Qd3 {?? now whites position is terrible, black has an endgame with a development advantage, some lovely doubled isolated pawns to aim at and an extra pawn to boot. Now black just has to convert these advantages to the full point} Qxd3 10. cxd3 exf4 11. a3 Be7 {take a look at the position, black has every advantage he could hope for and then some. his bishop pair rule the open board, white's doubled isolated pawns sit at the end of a half open file and black even has an extra pawn. if that wasn't enough whites dark square bishop is going to struggle to escape it's prison on c1along with the rook on a1.} 12. Nf3 O-O-O {getting the rook on the open file and keeping the king fairly near the centre as he may be needed at the frontline in the near future} 13. Nf2 {defending the horribly weak d pawns. } g5 {blacks pieces are nicely positioned so black starts to push his kingside pawn majority toward its goal. as a result white will be discouraged from castling kingside so the white king will likely remain in the centre where it will be easily attacked} 14. h3 {else the kingside pawns will crash through with g4 and g3} Rhe8 {encouraging white to castle into a pawn storm} 15. O-O {white decides the pawnstorm will be easier to weather than the discovered check} f5 {in stark contarst to whites d pawns the doubled black f pawns are of great atacking value and will be used to great effect to open the white kings position. This prefectly illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of doubled pawns, here the white pawns are completely immobile and so are very weak as they need to be defended with pieces therefore the white position is very passive. Blacks doubled pawns, on the other hand, are very mobile and are under no pressure from the white pieces and so can be used as a battering ram to smash open the white position} 16. Re1 {attempting to get some counter play by contesting the e file but maybe white should start by trying to develop the queenside} Bf6 {defending the e6 bishop and making whites queenside development even harder than it already is} 17. a4 {? this achieves nothing, white should try Rb1 with b4 and Bb2 to follow} g4 {the pawns continue to roll towards there goal} 18. hxg4 fxg4 19. Ne4 {giving the h2 square to the f3 knight and attacking the dark square bishop} Be7 {naturally black simply moves the bishop as he is in no way interested giving up his bishop pair.} 20. Nh2 {the only square} h5 {Black simply solidifies his position on the kingside, there is no rush, white can achieve nothing active as all his pieces are so passive and disorginised} 21. Nc3 Bc5+ 22. Kh1 Bf5 {threatening the rook, white can't even exchange here as after 23.Rxe8 Rxe8 white can't defend the back rank} 23. Ne4 {? i think moving the rook was stronger, this just steps into a powerful pin} Kb8 {again black need not act on the pin now as white needs at least 2 moves to defend the rook. trying to exploit the pin straight away with 23...Rxd3 is infact bad here as white simply replys 24.Nd6  winning the exchange} 24. b3 {24.b4 is a better try but that to loses to 24...Bf2! (not 24...Nxb4 25.Ba3!) 25.Re2 Bd4 26.Rb2 Bg7 27.Bb2 (27.Ba3 Rxd3) 27...Bxb2 28.Rxb2 Rxd3} Rxd3 {now black is winning a piece} 25. Bb2 {finally white manages to develop the c1 bishop, but its already to late.} Bxe4 26. Rac1 Bb6 {the bishop is monsterous on that diagonal} 27. Nf1 {?? steps into forced mate, but then there aren't exactly many alternatives. Re2 seems best, defending the g2 square and preparing to double rooks, but i very much doubt that it would affect the final result. notice that moving the c1 rook off the back rank to c4 also allows forced mate after 27...Bxg2 !} Rh3+ 28. Nh2 g3 29. d4 Nxd4 30. Kg1 Nf3+ 31. Kf1 Bd3+ 32. Re2 Bxe2# {}
