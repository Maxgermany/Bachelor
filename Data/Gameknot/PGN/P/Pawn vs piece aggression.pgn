1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3. f4 Bg4 4. Be2 Qd7 {Setting up to be an aggressive game - White staking out the center, while Black is getting his pieces moving early.} 5. h3 Bh5 {Major mistake, with only one piece defending the bishop now. The queen at d7 is boxing the bishop in. Bxe2, with some disadvantage to Black in position but minimizing his losses.} 6. Bxh5 Nxh5 7. Qxh5 g6 8. Qe2 f5 {Black doing something to shore his position up now, trying to open up the center for his pieces and possibly pin White's queen to his king.} 9. Nc3 Bg7 10. Nf3 Nc6 {Black has gone back to his piece-based approach. 10....e5 would have been better here. Black has a clearly worse position, as well as being down a knight.} 11. exf5 {White evidently wants to start the middlegame and get something going.} Qxf5 12. g4 Qa5 {White has been chasing Black's pieces around the board all game with his pawns, resulting in an advanced position. Where there is a pawn conflict, it will be between White's pawns on the 4th rank and Black's on the 6th, pushing the center of gravity of the battle towards Black's king. Black's pieces provide no help to him; they are perhaps a little more coordinated than White's, but not much. White still has an extra knight and his pieces are more centrally located.} 13. Bd2 Nd4 14. Nxd4 Bxd4 {Black trying to put some pressure on White, whose position is generally pretty well defended.} 15. Ne4 Qd5 16. c4 Qe6 17. Rb1 {The previous two moves White has ignored the Black threat on his b-pawn, which might have become an avenue for Black to breach White's defense and weaken the back rank. Black's attack has seriously been blunted, as the queen is back on the sixth rank and the bishop is little more than an obstacle White is working around. The move up of the c-pawn essentially made the b- and a-pawns irrelevant by breaking the chain with them, but White decides to consolidate his gains for a move.} d5 18. Ng5 Qxe2+ 19. Kxe2 {White has opened up the middle with his attack on the queen, and now this game is largely a flanking action. White has a definite advantage, but Black has some possibilities to scratch and claw for a draw. He might be well off to try to start trading away pieces.} O-O-O {This is not the way. It is understandable to try to get the rook into the game, but capturing the pawn on c4 will open up White's middle and allow some attacks on White's king, which is a bit out in the open. Had Black castled kingside, it would have allowed White to capture Black's pawn on d5, forcing Black to scramble some more. However, the knight fork to come is more devastating, and White correctly goes for material.} 20. Nf7 dxc4 21. Nxd8 Rxd8 22. dxc4 {The dust has settled, with White up a piece and the exchange. Black has few credible attacks here and essentially no hope of winning. However, his pawns might offer some hope of clogging up the middle and getting a draw from this mess. Moving a pawn to the 5th rank would blunt White's attack.} Bh8 {Entirely useless except to open up Black's rook. Now White has every reason to try to exchange pieces to get Black's rook off the board, the only really dangerous piece left.} 23. Be3 Bd4 24. Rhd1 c5 25. Bxd4 cxd4 {Two rooks against one, with Black's pawn caught between his rook and White's. What a mess.} 26. Rd3 Kc7 27. Rbd1 Rf8 {Black scrambling, as he has little recourse to defend the d-pawn. However, as long as he's going to lose it he might as well get rid of his useless e-pawn as well, which is clogging up his rook's mobility. A move to e4 would prompt a capture from White's f-pawn. At that point, White's king has only a capturable pawn between the Black rook and him, and the f-file is open as well. } 28. Kf3 g5 29. Rd3xd4 e5 30. Rd4d7+ {Black's whole problem this game has been falling in love with one piece to take, without noticing White's spatial advantage. Here he has pressed White into a mistake, although eventually of little consequence. White himself ought to understand that he's going to lose the f-pawn no matter what, and shift his rook to e4, where he could force Black into a pawn capture, which just protects White's king some more. Instead White wants to gobble up some of Black's pawns. That's fine, but leaves White vulnerable to a rook capture of the f-pawn, letting Black into White's backfield and complicating matters somewhat.} Kb6 31. Rxh7 gxf4 {But Black misses the opportunity, and might as well resign now. As this is an online game, however, what do we expect?} 32. Rd6+ Kc5 33. Rd5+ Kxc4 34. Rxe5 Rd8 35. Rxb7 Rd3+ 36. Kxf4 Rd4+ {Another grave mistake, allowing White to force a rook trade.} 37. Re4 Rxe4+ 38. Kxe4 a5 39. a4 {Now White's rook is quite well-positioned, preventing Black's king from getting to either of White's pawns on the left side of the board. White could probably win with this material, but gets lazy and just decides to promote to win.} Kc5 40. Rb5+ Kc4 41. Kf5 Kd3 42. g5 Kc2 43. g6 Kb1 44. g7 Ka1 45. g8=Q Kb1 {White's pawn on b2 is becoming something for Black's king to maneuver around.} 46. Qg1+ Kc2 47. h4 Kd3 48. Qg4 Ke3 49. Rb3+ Kd2 50. Qd4+ Kc2 51. Qc3+ Kb1 52. h5 {White decides to promote again, possibly worried about accidentally creating a stalemate situation.} Ka2 53. h6 Ka1 54. h7 Kb1 55. h8=Q Ka1 56. Qh1+ Ka2 57. Ra3# {Black just did everything wrong. White's play is aggressive with his pawns all game, but generally he just waits for Black to tie himself into ribbons and lose. Perhaps that aggression created Black's stupid play.}
