[Opening "Pirc (B08), classical (two knights) system"]

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 {The so called classical variation. The intention is to strengthen ones influence on e5, a key square in this opening. White wants to take a foothold there to make the black Bishop very passiv and to occupy the center.} Bg7 5. Ng5 {This seems to be a good place for the knight, however black gets an etch on development, and white obviously has abandoned his plan to occupy e5. } O-O 6. Bc4 {Now the plan becomes clear: aiming at the relatively weak f7 file. An exchange would drop blacks king safety, however black would have a relatively large advantage in development.  } e6 {I did not enjoy this move, since it blocks my bishop. White's attack is showing effect.  e6 is a somewhat two edged sword for black in the Pirc. It can, combined with c5, help to break through... but it can also lead to a weakened king safety and unfavorable pawn structures for black.} 7. d5 {A move I do not fully understand. getting a hold of the e5 square is normally an important goal in whites strategy: It simply locks the Bishop in. In this situation the push does not work yet.  I was not sure what to do in this situation, so my opponent at least confused me. e5 would block both our bishops. However one could aim for f5 and Bxf5 after an exchange. But since I'm no friend of that much closed up Positions...} h6 {Thinking that white would of course move his knight. Fritz recommends exd5 !? Since after exd5 follows 8 ... Re8. Forcing one light figure to "hang around". Leaving either d5 o g5 weak.  e.g. 9 Be3? Ng4!  However the move is not that bad. Although it will ruin my pawn structure on the kingsside } 8. dxe6 {I did not expect this move at all. and perhaps it would have been wiser...} hxg5 {... to play xe6 and apply pressure on the e file} 9. exf7+ Kh7 {And white has a very strong pawn on f7. } 10. O-O Nbd7 {Let's engage the f7 Pawn... However perhaps Ng4 would have been even better, as it let's the bishop stroll around again and cover g5.} 11. Bxg5 {Grabbing the undefended g5} Ne5 {I wanted to get rid of the f7 pawn and therefore  i had to get rid of the bishop....} 12. Qd4 Qd7 {White heightens the pressure at f6, probably planning Nd5, which seems to be a superior home. So i thought: Time to get out of the pin. I guess c5! would have been better :)} 13. f4 c5 {A brute force attack, and a little counter attack. The queen has to move! And she will be unable to cover the bishop on c4, so f7 will ultimately fall :) (together with the Bishop an c4!)  I think this move would have been possible even sooner. But somehow I did not see it... } 14. Bb5 {? Going to lose the exchange!} cxd4 15. Bxd7 Nexd7 {And the exchange is won} 16. Nb5 {Nb5: Well if I have to move anyway, why not there? Intending Nc7 and attacking the weak d6  However: e4 c2 and b2 are undefended at this moment.} Nxe4 {So why not make use of it? At this point I thought: Well even if I let him take my rook, I will still have enough material advantage, since the knight will never be able to get out alive.} 17. Rfe1 d5 {I'm not able to grab the efile myself, well then let's block it.   However Nxg5 is worth consideration, freeing the king and f7 is history.} 18. Nc7 Rxf7 19. Nxa8 Nxg5 {Get rid of the annoying f pawn and the bishop. The knight is somewhat out of play. White has two options: take back, or save his it's own knight. } 20. fxg5 Nc5 21. Nc7 Rxc7 22. b4 Ne4 {Although I could've been standing there with a +5 in material, I felt pretty confident. The Pawns on the 2nd rank would probably be easy to fetch and the 2 Bishops could be of devastating use. So at this point the game was imho practically won.  The e-file is blocked and so there is only one file left for white to use with his rook advantage, however that can be crumbled at any time by putting the bishop on g4 or by getting my rook on the 6th rank. However the game continued for a bit, and since I do not have a lot of experience with minor pieces endgames and since I suck at endgames anyway I decided to grab another pawn or two.} 23. Rad1 Rxc2 24. a4 a6 {preventing  b5, so that the next pawns can be fetched as well :)} 25. a5 Bd7 {With the intention to additionally block b5 and to probably harass the rooks. Bb5 will totally dominate the f file. and I could play d3 ... Bd4+ and Nf7+ afterwards...} 26. h4 Rb2 {Bf8 would be nice but the darn rook on d1...} 27. Rd3 Rxb4 {No need to hurry with the bishop... if he is planning to double i can still prevent it.} 28. Rh3 {?? Well that was unforeseen, but it finishes off the game. :) } Bxh3 {}
