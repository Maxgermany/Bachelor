1. e4 {A strange game, with a complex edged to edged position (i.e : probably mistakes from both sides) which suddenly basculated.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {I do not know much about the Petrov defense} 3. d4 {Anyway, I like the center game} Nxe4 {Most agressive answer...} 4. Bd3 {One tempo against one pawn, gambit situation... OK for me} d5 5. Nxe5 {Equilibrating the material situation, losing one tempo and aggressively contesting the center.} Nd7 6. Nxd7 {Lancelot the brave accepts the challenge of the black knight.} Bxd7 {... and falls on the battlefield.} 7. O-O {Arthur is safe now} Be7 {To prepare the castle and take control of the d8h4 diagonal.} 8. c4 {Now that the king is safe, the left wing soldiers can advance.} c6 9. cxd5 {Initiating a trade. Both sides will get an isolate pawn in the center.} cxd5 10. Nc3 {Perceval enters in the battle, straight toward the center.} Nxc3 {Not sure it's a good move : Black central pawn will still be isolated, white's one will be supported by his comrade on c3, the e file will be under white's control.} 11. bxc3 {No real choice} O-O 12. Qh5 {There were other candidate moves (12. Re1, 12. Rb1) but it's a fork attack between h7 (mating menace) and the isolated d5 pawn.} g6 13. Qxd5 {White has now full control on the center but Dame Guenièvre can easily be fired.} Qc7 {Menacing the c3 pawn.} 14. Bh6 {Menacing the rook and the king, on the long term. Black will have difficulties to force the DSB to leave his advanced post.} Rfd8 {Setting the rook in safe, aiming at the center, menacing the queen.} 15. Qb3 {Protecting the queen and the c pawn.} Rac8 {White controls the center, nobody conrols the open file, the black king is unsafe, white is ahead in material black's pieces are well grouped and can initiate a quick counterattack. Each side has one unprotected bishop. White has an isolated pawn on the left wing. } 16. Rac1 {White's plan is to attack the back king, using the open e file but for that I need to regroup the troops which are not on the proper squares. It will necessitate some manoeuvres because black has dangerous available possibilities.} Be6 {Attacking the queen, the a pawn and protecting f7} 17. Qb2 {Dama Guenièvre goes for a long trip. She'll move 7 times in the 27 total moves of the game.} Bf6 {Black's plan seems to contest the center. If he eliminates the c3 pawn, he'll have strong attacking possibilities.} 18. Rfe1 {Taking control of the open file} a6 {It seems to me a weak move. Probably done to prepare 19. ... b5. and may be to prevent 19. Bb5, so that black can play a further Re8.} 19. Qe2 {The queen carries on travelling in her domain. She still protects the a pawn and is now on the open file. Her final destination is f3} Qa5 {Black attacks on the queen's wing and still aim at the center but it weakens his position on the kingside.} 20. Rcb1 {Rook on the open file, menacing b7 I judged that white's position was now strong enough on the kingside to let black take pawns on the queenside.} b5 {Black's queenside pawns are now safe but the g2a8 diagonal is now wide open for white.} 21. Qf3 {The aim of the queen's travel. Menacing mate by 22. Qxf6 ... 23. Qg7+ mate} Bg7 {Fianchetoing the bishop.} 22. Bg5 {Forcing the rook to move.} Rd7 {To double the rook but the c8 rook is now unprotected and dame guenièvre is looking at a8} 23. Re2 {To double the rooks and indirectly protect c3 (which I hoped black would bite).} Qxc3 {?? mistake, the black queen is doomed and the game is lost for black.} 24. Rc2 {If 24. ... Qa5 25. Rxc8+ and the mate is unavoidable for if 25. ... Bf8 26. Bh6} Qxc2 {Black trades a queen against Rook} 25. Bxc2 {Taking the queen} Rxc2 {Blunder, the game is lost for black. Unavoidable mate in 5} 26. Qa8+ {in 4...} Bf8 {... in 3} 27. Bh6 {Black submits here.}
