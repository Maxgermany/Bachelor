1. e4 c6 {Hi everyone, just for once it is me that gets those pawns rolling!  This game against my buddy Bob Jacobs, a player less than 100 points south of my rating, is very even until well into the late middlegame when a pile up on the c file of my heavies leads to me winning a pawn due to a pin on his dark square bishop.  After that I still end up with work to do.  One big dilemma that I was faced with was "Should Glenda abandon the c file to the Wicked Witch of the West and if so, where should she go?"  Thankfully that dilemma was somehow sorted with Glenda able to go back to that file.  A queen swap followed and I had a strong wall of passers.  It seemed plain sailing, but, I ask, when is a jstevens1 victory plain sailing?  Not often.  In the end, a knight move enabled me to put the advanced queenside pawns just where I wanted them.  Even him giving up his dsb would not have prevented a joyous reunion between Glenda and Henry so he waved the white flag.  He kicks off with the Caro-Kann Defense and I respond with the exchange variation hoping for open play.} 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 a6 {4. ........ a6 - to prepare a b5 thrust.} 5. c3 Bg4 6. Bf4 {6. Bf4 - Frere Lenoir develops onto what he hopes will be a productive diagonal for him.} Nc6 7. Be2 Nf6 8. Nbd2 e6 9. O-O {9. 0-0 - fairly routine development up to here.  My queen knight has a dual function, to give additional back up to my f3 knight and to contest the enemy knight's control of e4.  Henry is now tucked up in bed.} Be7 10. Ne5 Bxe2 11. Qxe2 O-O 12. Nxc6 bxc6 {12. ......... bxc6 - a few exchanges have cleared the position a bit.  I didn't think that my e5 knight would be able to remain on that square for that much longer so I decided to trade it in.  At least the knight exchange leaves Bob with a queenside isolani which will weigh against him later on.} 13. Be5 {13. Be5 - Frere Lenoir takes the horse's place though.} Nd7 14. Bg3 c5 15. Nf3 {15. Nf3 - opens up the possibility of putting another knight on that e5 square but the priority is to bolster that d4 pawn.} Bf6 16. Be5 Nxe5 17. Nxe5 Qc7 18. Nf3 {18. Nf3 - after a plethora of exchanges my knight drops back to f3 to cover the d4 pawn.  Black may have a slight edge here.  He now advances to a5 and this becomes an unfortunate choice of square for that poor little black pawn.} a5 19. b3 Rfe8 20. Qd1 cxd4 21. cxd4 Qd6 22. Qd2 {22. Qd2 - Oh dear, now my d4 pawn is an isolani.  Thankfully this does not present too much of a problem but there is going to be some shuffling around of my heavies.  In the middlegame I am often faced with "Where do I go from here?"  Well, that c file just needs to have a white rook on it before black gets the chance to bag it first.  Glenda supports the c1-c3 squares as well as the d4 pawn so that makes it ideal for a doubling, even trippling on that file.  Note that if the a8 rook moves off the a file the black pawn on a5 is up for grabs.} h6 23. Rfc1 Bd8 24. Rc2 Bc7 25. g3 {25. g3 - as black does not have a light squared bishop then I create luft by pushing up my g pawn and carry on with my c-plan.} Rac8 26. Rac1 Qb6 27. Rc2c6 Qb7 {27. ....... Qb7 - the Wicked Witch is driven back.  Now comes the tripling.} 28. Rc1c2 Re7 29. Qc1 {29. Qc1 - Voila!} Kh7 30. Rc6c5 f5 {30. .......... f5?  I think black should have given that a pawn a little more back up.  Note that the dark squared bishop is PINNED!} 31. Rxa5 Bxa5 32. Rxc8 Rc7 {32. ........ Rc7?! - Maybe Bc7 might have been better, my rook may well have been short of squares.  Now the other pair of rooks are exchanged and we are approaching the endgame.} 33. Rxc7 Bxc7 34. Qc2 Bb6 35. a4 {35. a4 - passed pawns must be pushed if safe to do so.} Ba5 36. Qd3 {36. Qd3 - here I decide to cede the c file temporarily.  Thank heaven Henry has the g2 square to escape to should the Wicked Witch land a check on c1.} Qc7 37. Qb5 Bc3 38. Qc5 {38. Qc5 - Glenda is allowed to move onto the c file and now a queen trade is forced.  Although it allowes black a d pawn passer I now have 3 queenside passers.  The knight on f3 now becomes a knight in shining armour to me.} Qxc5 39. dxc5 Ba5 40. c6 Kg8 41. b4 Bc7 {41. ........ Bc7 - If Bxb4?? then Bob's dsb is decoyed away from the a5-d8 diagonal which will allow Glenda to reappear with disastrous results for Bob.  My pawns now start their roll down the queenside.} 42. Nd4 {42. Nd4 - d-d-d-l-d-d!! In gallops the knight.  He is heading for b3 to stop the enemy king invading on c5 should the pawn chain remain on a4, b5 and c6.} Kf7 43. Nb3 e5 44. a5 Ke7 45. Kf1 {45. Kf1 - in the endgame it is vital for the king to be centralised, even more so here.  Black starts a pawn roll of his own and both Henry and his steed must work together to contain them as well as protect that vital pawn wall on the queenside.} d4 46. Ke2 Kd6 47. b5 Bb8 {47. .......... Bb8 - that bishop will be cut off soon.} 48. Kd3 Kd5 49. a6 e4+ 50. Kc2 d3+ 51. Kc3 Kd6 52. Nd4 {52. Nd4!! - This move proves decisive.  Henry's steed threatens to pick off the f pawn with check.  But he also provides two other vital roles.  Firstly he defends my c pawn.  Secondly he prepares b6 which will entomb that dark squared bishop.  Even if the black king were to move then at least Henry would not have to dodge a check from the dsb before I had a chance to entomb him.  He decides to back up the f pawn with his g pawn.  Now comes the coup de grace.} g6 53. b6 h5 54. a7 {54. a7 - and with this move black waves the white flag as he will in two moves be down a whole queen and Glenda will clean up those black pawns with consumate ease before netting the black king.  An interesting endgame battle because in the final position just look at that impressive black pawn chain of Bob's!  He just got pipped at the post.  Hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now.
