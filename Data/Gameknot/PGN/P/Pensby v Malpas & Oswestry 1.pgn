[Opening "Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45)"]

1. d4 {One of those games which are lovely to play. White's king goes for a little walk, encouraged by the offer of a pawn and then a bishop, both of which he accepts and white resigns rather than get mated on move 20. Of course afterwards Fritz tells me how I could have done it quicker!} Nf6 {I play my usual.} 2. Bg5 {Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trompowsky_Attack} Ne4 {Although generally it is not a good idea to move pieces twice in the opening, here it is justified, as there is the attack on the bishop.} 3. Bh4 {So the Bishop moves.} g5 {Hitting the bishop again.} 4. Bg3 {He retreats, although 4. f3 is more commonly played and scored better.} c5 {Attacking his centre.} 5. f3 {Attacking my knight.} Nxg3 {So I take.} 6. hxg3 {He takes back.} Bg7 {I attack d4 again.} 7. c3 {He protects.} Qc7 {Protecting c5 and attacking g3. Qb6 is strong here too.} 8. Kf2 {So he protects g3. } cxd4 {I decided to open the position for my bishops.} 9. cxd4 {He takes back.} e5 {I strike in the centre again.} 10. e3 {I think 10. d5 e4 11. fxe4 Bxb2 12.	Nd2 Bxa1 13. Qxa1 O-O is probably a better attempt by white - he has a pawn as compensation for being the exchange down. As played he gets torn apart.} exd4 {So opening it up more.} 11. exd4 {He takes back.} Nc6 {I attack d4 for a third time.} 12. Ne2 {He defends it.} Qb6 {I attack and pin d4.} 13. Ke3 {The only way to protect d4, but probably better just to allow d4 to fall. White already has a very difficult position.} O-O {With Re8 check coming in.} 14. f4 {So he tries to create a safe square for his king.} Re8+ {So I check.} 15. Kf3 {Continuing with his plan.} g4+ {Offering first the pawn. Fritz likes this move, although he tells me Nxd4+ was marginally better - a mate in 15. Obviously I need to do some work on my mates in 15!} 16. Kxg4 {Which he takes.} d5+ {Bringing my other bishop into play with tempo.} 17. f5 {Blocking the check.} Bxf5+ {But the bishop will not be denied! I was glad that Frizt agreed with me that this is the best move.} 18. Kxf5 {White takes again. Ok stop - what would you play as black?} Re4 {Did you find this? I am threatening two mates in 2 now. At the time, I thought it was mate in three now. Fritz tells me it is mate in 8 now, and Ne5!! was a quicker execution - a mate in 5.} 19. Nbc3 {Nf4 was the only way to fight on, although as I said, white is still getting mated in 7 after Nxd4 check.} Ne7+ {White resigns rather than be mated. Many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system.}
