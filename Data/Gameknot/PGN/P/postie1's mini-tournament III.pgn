1. e4 {HELLO, faithful hiredgun112 fans,friends,followers and watchers!!!!!!!!!Least i forget those that wish to start a fan club in my honor,please,please continue to hold on that.But yes you may start sending some of my games to chess life for them to use in the magazine.Why i believe this short annotation should be posted is because i believe my opponent was doing better than he thought but he resigned.My hats off to him he is a good player.Okay here we go.He opens with e4} e5 {I of course i respond with e5.Iuse this alot but i am getting leary of this open.Any different response you believe would be better please post.thanks} 2. Bc4 {Okay possible fools mate,why i am leary of e5 response} Qf6 {I do not  like bring lady out this early(Unlike in real life in my younger days they like me carrying them out early because then and now i was so GOOD LOOKING!!!!!LOL).Seriously i thought i was getting set up for fools mate} 3. Nf3 {Nfe for him possibly he thought i would take knight,thus sacking my queen.Or could be he was just developing unsure.} Bc5 {Bring out REV aiming for f2,later possible} 4. g3 {He decided not castle king side} d6 {Chain but concerned i do not have any knights out yet} 5. d3 {His chain} Nc6 {Finally knight out,i believe i am better developed} 6. Ng5 {I think trying to draw my queen into trap.Does not work} Bxf2+ {Okay maybe a little premature} 7. Ke2 {Now Bf2 out of danger} Bg4+ {Okay  i have bishops and queen combo set up} 8. Kf1 {Escapes check} Bxd1 {I take the Queen.Then my opponent resigns.He had several options instead resigning Kg1,Nf3 or many other options i wished he had not resigned.Okay thinks for looking at this postive feedback accepted,negative tolerated.See you next time}
