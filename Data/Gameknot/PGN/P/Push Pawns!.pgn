[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A46)"]

1. d4 {I generally lose against this opponent. But in this game, I was able to seize the initiative early and come out ahead in the resulting tactical complications.} Nf6 2. Nf3 d6 3. e3 Nbd7 4. Bd3 e5 {Generally good against White's set up.} 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. e4 Be7 {Black has gained a tempo through transpostion since the e pawn moved twice} 7. O-O c6 8. Nc3 O-O 9. Bg5 {Standard Hanham formation with White's bishop misplaced on d3} Qc7 {with the idea of freeing the QN and a Rook to the d-file} 10. Re1 b5 {Black pushes for more space on the Queenside.} 11. a3 a5 12. Rc1 {Prepares to attack Black's pawns and the c file later.} Nc5 {Puts pressure on e4.} 13. Bf1 {White retreats the bishop.} b4 14. axb4 axb4 15. Bxf6 {Necessary to protect the e4 pawn} Bxf6 16. Nb1 Rd8 17. Qe2 Ra2 {Black wants to provoke some sort of weakness, if possible.} 18. Qc4 Qa5 19. c3 {19 c3 !? begins a highly tactical struggle. 19...RxP??, PxP! wins a piece, and White threatens to win a piece by cxb.} b3 {...b3! prepares for ..Ba6} 20. Qe2 {Qe2?! I expected Qb4...} Nd3 {Wins the exchange, but White has counterplay.} 21. Nfd2 Nxc1 22. Rxc1 Rxb2 {...Rxb2!? creates more tactical complications, Black needs to be concerned about the rook being trapped.} 23. Qe3 {23 Qe3, stronger than it might appear.  White hopes for counterplay, possibly picking off the advanced b pawn and trapping the rook to get the exchange back.} Be6 {Black decides this is the best available move to deal with the threats of Nc4 and Bc4. } 24. Bc4 {Hoping for ..BxB.24 Nc4 BxN, 25 BxB was also possible.} Rc2 {24 ...Rc7, a tactical move that exploits the position of the Rook on c1. The mate threat can't be ignored, and exchanging off White's last rook is unpalatable. } 25. Re1 {Avoids the rook exchange. } Bxc4 26. Nxc4 Qa2 {Black decides to press on, since White must be careful to not exchange or allow the pawn to Queen if it leads to a back rank mate.} 27. Nba3 {An attempt to win back the exchange. } b2 {27...b2!!. If now NxR, the pawn queens and White loses more material. If now Rb1, QxR ! and mate follows. White can't afford a rook exchange and Black threatens Be2 as well.} 28. Nb1 Rc1 {Black could just take the Knight and be up a rook, but decides to simplify first.} 29. Nca3 {Na3? White had no good choices, probably looking for a swindle.} Rdd1 {White resigns, to avoid immediate mate Black must give up another rook at least.}
