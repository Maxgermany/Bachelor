1. d4 Nf6 {Pretty standard} 2. c4 e6 {Is he wanting to play the Nimzo-Indian?} 3. Nc3 d5 {No, Black transposes back to the Queen's Gambit. } 4. Bg5 Nbd7 {There is of course a cute little trap here. 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Nxd5? Nxd5! 7. Bxd8 Bb4+ and Black wins back the queen with a won game. } 5. e3 Be7 {Both sides continue to develop.} 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Qc2 {I usually play this here, and hope for h6 8. h4 I am not sure that it is really that good for White, but it is interesting and leads to a double-edged game.} c5 8. cxd5 {This is best. Black can now recapture with a pawn and leave himself with an isolated QP or recpature with the Knight and concede central control. Perhaps cxd4 is best which leads to a bit of a boring level position. What my opponent replied is the most common reply.} Nxd5 9. Bxe7 Nxe7 {Black recaptures with the Knight, again to avoid being left with a weak, isolated QP. Start guessing White moves now.} 10. Bd3 {Did you get it? White hits the h pawn with gain of time. Nothing for anything else.} g6 {I am not sure that this is best, as it weakens the King side, although it was played in Vasquez, Rodrigo Rafael (2514) vs. Tempone, Marcelo (2437) which ended in a draw. What now?} 11. O-O-O b6 {A point also for 0-0 which was played in Vasquez, Rodrigo Rafael (2514) vs. Tempone, Marcelo (2437). I wanted a double-edge game. Pen-y-ffordd are a first division side and Capenhurst are a 2nd division side, so we had to give them a 2.5 point lead, so I knew we needed some wins, especially with those of us who had White! What now?} 12. dxc5 bxc5 {White isolates Black's pawns. Of course, if Black recaptures with the knight Bxg6 wins for White. Also a point for the aggresive 12. h4. What now?} 13. Be4 Rb8 {Also a point for h4 still. Guess again!} 14. Ne5 Qc7 {Also a point for g4 or h4. Guess again!} 15. Nc4 f5 {15. Nc4 eyes the squares a5, b6, e5 and most crucially, d6. It is a superb knight, blockading the isolated c pawn and unable to be driven away by a pawn. Nothing for anything else. Guess again.} 16. Bf3 e5 {White keeps the Bishop on the lovely long diagonal, and keeps the d file open so Nd6 is a threat. Nothing for anything else. What now?} 17. Nd5 Nxd5 {White has to strike quickly to take advantage of the weakening of the d5 square of Black's last move. If he doesn't occupy d5 now, Black will close off the chance with e4. Nothing for anything else. Now - do you take back with rook or bishop?} 18. Bxd5+ Kg7 {Of course! The Bishop is wonderful here. But how do you increase the pressure now?} 19. Qc3 Rf6 {With White not having a Black squared bishop any more, the queen belongs on black squares. Besides 19. Qc3 threatens f4. Nothing for anything else. How do you continue now?} 20. Rd2 Bb7 {Yes, White wants to dominate the only open file, the d file. Nothing for anything else. Black should have played Ba6. What should White play now?} 21. Bxb7 Rxb7 {White exchanges, and now, although materially is for the time being level, I think White has a forced win from here. How?} 22. Rhd1 Nf8 {22. Rhd1 had a powerful attack on the Black knight, so nothing for anything else. What now?} 23. Nxe5 Kg8 {I chose the simple way, although Nd6 is probably even stronger. They both win! What now?} 24. Rd2d8 Qg7 {A point also for 24. Ng4 which also wins. What now?} 25. Rd1d7 Rxd7 {White still has to be careful for instance 25. Qc4 check, R(f6)-f7 26. Nxf7?? Qxb2 mate! So I opted to exchange Black's only active piece. Nothing for anything else. What now?} 26. Nxd7 Rf7 {White must recapture with the knight, deduct 10 if you took back with the rook and threw a piece away! What now?} 27. Qc4 Kh8 {27. Qc4 pins the rook on f7 and so threatens the knight on f8, which is why Black moves his king into the corner. Yes White can also win by exchanging everything, but you should be looking for a quciker win! What now? } 28. Qxc5 Kg8 {White takes a pawn and adds another attacker to f8, so forcing the Black king back. Black is nearly paralysed, but what is the quickest finish?} 29. Qd5 Kh8 {A point also for Qc4 with the a similar situation. What now?} 30. Qxf7 {Well done. Black resigns as Qxf7 31. Rxf8 leads to an ending where White is a knight and 2 pawns up. For the record Take the full number of points if you played Qxf7 on move 28. Now add up your score and leave a message to say how you have done. Don't forget to rate this annotation too!
