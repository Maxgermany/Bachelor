1. d4 {Johndyson is a hard opponent. He is an experienced player with an impressive record. I am particularly proud of this game because it shows how positional advantage can be converted into victory. } d5 2. e4 c6 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 {This sets the scene - the pawn structure for the middle game is this: it's White's pawn supremacy on the Queen's side, Black's advantage on the King side. } Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. Nf3 Nd7 7. Bf4 {White has a nice development. Computer analysis shows that White has a small advantage. } e6 8. Bd3 {White's focus is on fast development. } Ngf6 9. O-O Be7 10. Bxg6 {Weakening the black pawn structure on the King's side. } hxg6 11. c4 {Starting the pawn advance. } O-O 12. Re1 {The rook belongs on the half-open file. } Re8 13. Qd3 Qb6 {The black Queen advance threatens with many difficulties. I analyzed in-depth a sacrifice of the b2 pawn, which leads to complications. Black rejects the sacrifice. } 14. c5 Qa5 15. a4 {The black queen continues to move around. The pawn advance at this point brings the added benefit of restricting its mobility. } Nd5 16. Bd2 Qa6 17. Qc2 {After long analysis, I determined that the exchange of the Queen tends to lead to an equalized play. } b6 18. b4 Rab8 19. Rab1 bxc5 20. dxc5 {The pressure on the Queen side pays out. Now White's pawn advantage is getting very big. } Qc8 21. Ne4 {White can now develop an initiative. I was a little bit uncertain, however the main idea was to get the Queen out of the way, possibly preparing for a King side surprise attack, and bringing the Knights to the center in order to pressure the point d6. } Rd8 22. Qc4 a6 23. Qe2 Qc7 24. Nd4 Rba8 25. Nb3 e5 26. Na5 f5 27. Nd6 e4 28. f3 exf3 29. gxf3 {While the tactical position of White continues to improve, the pawn structure on the King side seems now secured for White, as well. } Nf8 30. Nac4 Bh4 31. Ref1 Be7 32. Kh1 Bxd6 33. Nxd6 Qe7 34. Qxe7 Nxe7 35. Bg5 Rd7 36. Nc4 Nd5 37. Nb6 Nxb6 38. cxb6 {Through tactical maneuvers, White has managed to get a passed pawn. } Ne6 39. h4 Kf7 40. Kg2 Rd5 41. Rbc1 f4 42. Rxc6 Nxg5 43. Rc7+ Kf6 44. b7 Rb8 45. hxg5+ Rxg5+ 46. Kf2 {This is a clear winning position for White. } Rh5 {Computer analysis shows:  Inaccuracy: +2.78 » … Rh5 47. Rd1 Ke6 48. Re1+ Kf6 49.
