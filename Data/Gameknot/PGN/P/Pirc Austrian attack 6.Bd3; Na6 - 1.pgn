1. e4 d6 {This game came from the Pirc Defense mini-tournament} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 {Austrian attack} Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Bd3 Na6 7. O-O c5 8. d5 {The closed Austrian.  This causes black to have a cramped game.  Theory states that white will over-extend himself; unable to protect the pawns.  } Bg4 {I have always played this continuation of the Austrian as black.  Yes, I know of the 8...Nc7; 8...Rb8, but I am not sure of the goals and theories behind these moves clearly to play them correctly.} 9. Bc4 Nc7 {I am afraid of having double a pawns and since he has moved his   d3 bishop there is no point of me hoping to play knight b4 in the future, thus Nc7 } 10. h3 Bxf3 11. Qxf3 Nd7 {And I believe this is still a book move.  I am unsure if it is or not.  Anyways, All the previous moves were well know to me and were book.  } 12. a4 a6 {I wanted to play; ...b5 first before;...e6} 13. f5 {And white goes in for his attack!  Nd7 did prevent the e5 push for white, but I think the position called for the the development of White's other pieces} Ne5 {White has made a nice square for me to hop on!} 14. Qe2 Nxc4 15. Qxc4 b5 {The only continuation I felt comfortable with.} 16. axb5 {Accepting the challenge} axb5 17. Rxa8 bxc4 18. Rxd8 Rxd8 19. fxg6 hxg6 20. Ne2 {After the exchanges we are now on the brink of transposing into the endgame} Nb5 21. c3 {Pawns on the same square of his bishop} Nc7 22. Bf4 Rb8 23. Rb1 {Passive rook} Rb6 {  !   Protecting d6 in-order to play e6. Again the only continuation I felt comfortable playing.} 24. h4 e6 25. dxe6 fxe6 26. g4 Nb5 {Planing to play;...Nxc3; NxN...Bxc3. If white captured on c3 I would win the rook} 27. Bd2 Na3 {     ! Reducing to an endgame} 28. Ra1 Rxb2 29. Rxa3 Rxd2 30. Nf4 Kf7 {?? bad move on my part} 31. Ra7+ {!} Kg8 32. Nxe6 {??} Bxc3 {the only capture by my Pirc bishop} 33. Ra8+ Kf7 34. Ng5+ Ke7 35. Ra7+ Kd8 {! I seen repeating checks if I walk back to;...f8; ...e8} 36. h5 gxh5 37. gxh5 Bd4+ 38. Kf1 c3 {White resigned}
