[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Bg4 {A rare line. The idea is to take BxN so to unbalance white's game. White can answer with Nd2, saving the pawn's structure, but black won't take it, taking advantage to the trapped dsb. White will have to kick the bishop with h3, etc. Just another game. I played...} 3. Bf4 {My usual, that turned out to be pretty unusual. } Bxf3 4. gxf3 {To the center. Even if this means to leave my king exposed. But will he be able to exploit that properly? Let's see...} Nc6 {It doesn't seem so. This is almost always a bad move for black, since he wants to play f5 sooner or later. } 5. e3 {Starting to build a fortress. I want to develop my lsb on h3, but I want to prepare it before. } a6 {A loss of tempo. My plan wasn't Bb4, and even so, it was good for him. } 6. h4 {Preparing Bh3, defended by the rook. } h6 {Another passive move...} 7. h5 {!? If he is not developing, I'm not in a hurry. And this move prevents g5.} e6 8. Bh3 {If Qh4, Bg2, and the queen must go back. } Bb4+ 9. c3 {Always a loss of tempo from black's part. My plan is to develop the knight on d2 anyway. } Bd6 {NOrmally, I place my knight on e5, but now he is not anymore, and I have no choice, really. Bg3, e5, and black starts his path to freedom. } 10. Bxd6 Qxd6 11. f4 {Fortress complete, queen free to develop... NOW I can think about my queenside... and my king's safety. } Nf6 {Normal and good. } 12. Rg1 {Again delaying simple developement in favour of attack. } Rg8 {The best move. } 13. Nd2 {Ok, let's develop :-( I though a lot about Qb3, but after Na5, Qb5+, Nc6... what?} O-O-O 14. b4 {Attacking again!} g6 {Ok, now I have to react. } 15. hxg6 Rxg6 16. Rxg6 {No choice. If Ke2, Rd-g8.} fxg6 {The black's pawns are very dangerous. } 17. a4 {I have no easy way to attack e6, so let's go on. } Ne4 18. Nxe4 {A good chance to break his pawns. } dxe4 19. Qg4 {It seemed very strong at the moment, attacking two pawns. In fact, Qb3 was probably better, with b5 to follow. } Ne7 {Smart, minimizing the loss of a pawn and keeping the connected free ones. } 20. Qxe6+ {I took the bite, thinking that not much more would be done otherwise. } Qxe6 21. Bxe6+ Kb8 22. Ke2 {Freeing the rook, and abandoning any queenside attack plan. } h5 23. Rg1 {Blocking the knight, and threatening Bf7.} Rd6 24. Bh3 {I didn't consider Bf7 as wise, here. I'm not sure. } Nd5 {His knight's turn to attack. } 25. Kd2 Nb6 26. a5 Nc4+ 27. Kc2 b6 28. Kb3 Nd2+ 29. Kc2 Nc4 30. f5 {Queen's gone, it is possible for me to counterattack. Black can play checks, but he doesn't want drawn.} gxf5 31. Bxf5 {Now white has a threat on black's king. } bxa5 32. Rg8+ Ka7 33. Bxe4 {I prefer to leave a pawn in b4. If a4, I can draw with Ra8+, but I can go on playing for a win, I think, since Rg1 blocks the pawn. } c6 {Stopping the Ra8 check (with draw),} 34. Rg7+ Kb6 35. bxa5+ {He must take with the knight, since otherwise I will take h5 after a check. } Nxa5 {This way the knight is in a passive position, for now, and it blocks its own pawn. This gives me time to...} 36. Rh7 Re6 {The pawn is mine, but how to avoid the rook to harass the bishop or the black pawn in f2?} 37. f3 {A bad answer, as we'll see.} Nc4 {Now e3 is weak. } 38. Kd3 Nb2+ 39. Ke2 {The only move to avoid draw or loss. } a5 {The race begins, but I must stay calm. } 40. Rxh5 a4 41. Rh1 Ka5 {If a3, he'll lose it with Ra1. } 42. Ra1 Rh6 {Incredibly, I oversaw this pretty move, with a lot of threats. } 43. f4 {THE ONLY move to avoid massive material loss...} Rh2+ 44. Kf3 {Now, Nc5 is strong for black, threatening Ns2+, winning the bishop. But black blundered...} Rc2 {A pity. } 45. Bxc2 {}
