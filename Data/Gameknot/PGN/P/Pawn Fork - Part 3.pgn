1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  In a MT commemorating the victims of the Christchurch Earthquake I got to play my buddy, Steve who is an up and coming Class B 1600+ player.  He is a serious threat to me because I have lost to him in a Traxler MT and playing black in the Japanese Earthquake MT I ended up conceding a Low Draw to him.  So I got my revenge in kind with a humble pawn.  How did this happen?  Well, if you follow the annotation and the following gameknot analysis link you will see just how it happened.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15655565&fb=1&rnd=0.37816544131776747.  Steve kicks off with 1. Nf3, the Reti Opening.} c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {4. ...... Nf6 - I was tempted to exchange knights here but I did not yet want to bring the Wicked Witch of the West onto a such a commanding square so I decided to develop a piece.} 5. Nc3 e6 {5. ..... e6 - preparing a possible d5.} 6. a3 Bc5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. e4 O-O {8. ..... 0-0 - after getting my pieces out I tucked Henry away on the kingside.  I plan to fianchetto Fou Leblanc on b7 which I manage to achieve in a couple of moves from now.} 9. Be2 b6 10. O-O Bb7 11. Be3 Rc8 12. Rc1 d6 {12. ..... d6 - another hedgehog looking jstevens1 position.  White now decides to try and break it up, but will he end up being spiked on the hedgehog?  We shall see.  ("Spiked on the hedgehog" is a Jospeak way of describing my opponent losing material as a result of injudicious incursions into my position).} 13. f4 a6 14. Bf3 Nb8 {14. ..... Nb8 - this innocent looking retreat uncovers an attack on the c4 pawn.  Steve notices this and decides to stab at my knight.  I decided to exchange bishops on f3.} 15. e5 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 dxe5 17. Rcd1 {17. Rcd1? - this tempting attack on Glenda will now result in white dropping a pawn.  Glenda will now defend the pawn on e5.  She is also attacking (well, that makes a change!) the white pawn on c5.} Qc7 18. fxe5 Qxe5 19. Rfe1 {19. Rfe1 - I was expecting Bf4 here but Glenda wisely decided to return to c7 to avoid a move such as 20. Bxb6.} Qc7 20. Rd4 Bd6 21. Bf4 {21. Bf4 - this move prevents Bxh2+ but allows a pawn fork which I execute on the next move.} e5 22. Rxd6 Qxd6 23. Bxe5 Qd8 24. Rd1 Nfd7 {24. ..... Nfd7 - I voluntarily move my f6 knight into a pin to avoid my pawns being broken up in front of Henry.} 25. Qg4 {25. Qg4?? - oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, this move allows the gain of a whole rook, do you see how?} Nxe5 26. Rxd8 Nxg4 27. Rxf8+ Rxf8 {27. .... Rxf8?? - I give this move two question marks because I made it so automatically.  In the endgame it should have been Henry going to this square and not my rook and my rook should have kept on the c column putting pressure on that weak pawn on c4.  Thankfully my opponent allows my advanced knight to manoeuvre round and wreak havoc on white's queenside pawns.} 28. h3 Ne3 29. c5 bxc5 30. Nxc5 Nc4 31. Nb1 {31. Nb1 - Nd3 would have protected the b2 pawn but then my rook would have gone to d8 and chased it off.} Nxb2 32. a4 Rc8 {32. .... Rc8 - after this move Steve waved the white flag after my rook on c8 chases away the defender of the pawn on a5, leaving my pawn on a6 the possible glory of Glendadom.  Steve does not wish to see this and so I ended up with nearly 6 rating points in the bank.  Nice.}
