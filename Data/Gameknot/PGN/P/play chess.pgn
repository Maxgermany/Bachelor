1. e4 {thought i would give annotating a try.} c5 {c pawn opening for black should lead to quick counterattack} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 e6 {looks like the beginning of the Ruy vs. the sicillian def. } 4. d4 {a little gambit.  white is looking to control the middle and begin king side attack while thwarting blacks queen side attack.} cxd4 5. Nxd4 {current position is in whites favor. by both development and space controled.} Nf6 6. Nc3 a6 {a passive move which does little for blacks development. this delay in developing his pieces will contribute greatly to blacks eventual demise.} 7. Be3 {white continues to develope his troops for combat.  focusing on king side attack and contrl of the center.   take note on bishops position.} b5 {this move was anticipated when a6 was made. however; did not concern me} 8. Bb3 {simple retreat still owning the diagonal} Bb7 {an attack on the e4 pawn, black seems to want to take some claim to the middle.   Is it too late?} 9. f3 {f3 comes to e4 defence.  also limits the queen from  jumping into action right away.  she is not  needed till later although} g6 {fianchetto the bishop this is due} 10. Qe2 {some might say why not Qd2 take out the black bishop.  not bad plan.  but  i had something else in mind. } Bg7 11. Ncxb5 {sac the knight for 2 pawns!?} axb5 12. Qxb5+ Qd7 13. Qxd7+ Nbxd7 14. O-O-O {my intention was to open up that side of the board and rid it of its main defender.  there is more comfort in open field combat.  } O-O {both kings have been casled to safety.  black seems to be more secure though.       I must say that white has a younger king who sometimes likes to get into the mix.} 15. Nb5 {threatening d6 hoping to even up material} Nc5 {counter attack} 16. Bxc5 {some might say not a great trade giving up a bishop for a knight in game leading to open } dxc5 17. Nd6 Rfb8 18. a3 {this was preparation for the white square bishop to report to active duty} Bf8 {looks like black is activating his black square bishop this is troubling move. threatens knight and a3 also defending his c5 pawn. busy bishop} 19. e5 {if he takes kight with bishop white has passed pawn this is good.  also threatening to take knight pushing him into the background} Ne8 20. Nxb7 {that bishop had to go so white can begin kingside pawn attack} Rxb7 21. Bc4 {i want that pawn to stay there hendering the black bishop.} Rab8 22. b3 Ng7 23. g4 Ra7 24. a4 {it is time for the ground troops to open up some wholes in blacks defence for the big guns to enter } Ne8 {not sure where to put that knight?} 25. Kb2 {ok this was a hasty desition on my part } Rxa4 {oops} 26. Kc3 {i could have brougth my king up here the other way and saved my pawn} Rab4 {i won't loose in trade off here.  my king is really rather safe here. blacks attack is stunted and his reinforcements have a long journey. not to mention an attack to defend on the otherside of the board} 27. h4 Nc7 28. Rd7 {did't really think this knight would stick around to fight a rook standing next to him.  this is a good row for my rook to occupy,} Nb5+ {i did see this coming } 29. Kb2 Nd4 30. f4 {i need this pawn and need it right where it moved to.  his second attack didn't cost me any moves only forced the ones i intended to make.} h6 31. h5 {not taking the pawn could pove more dangerous} gxh5 32. gxh5 {the g file will be mine} Bg7 33. Rh2 f6 34. Rg2 {so will the bishop} Rb8b7 {that was not the best move to make very costly.  } 35. Rgxg7+ Kf8 36. Rdxb7 Rxb7 {}
