1. f4 {Bird's Opening. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird's_Opening} d5 {The most common reply. Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playing From's Gambit (1...e5). However, the From's Gambit is notoriously double edged and should only be played after significant study, and black has to be ready for a transposition to the King's Gambit with 2. e4.} 2. Nf3 g6 {This is considered the main line} 3. e3 {And so is this.} Bg7 {Black completes the fianchetto.} 4. c3 {Slightly unusual, normally a sign that white will adopt a Stonewall formation with pawns on d4, e3, and f4 and attempt a kingside attack.} Nd7 {This is a bit unusual too. My plan is e7-e5 and if he stops it with d2-d4 I can play Ng8-f6-e4 and support it with Nd7-f6.} 5. Be2 {But he doesn't stop it.} e5 {So I play it!} 6. fxe5 {He takes.} Nxe5 {I take back.} 7. O-O {He castles.} Ne7 {Of course avoiding Nf6??? 8. Nxe5!} 8. d4 {Attacking my knight - but giving himself a weak e pawn, backward on a semi-open file, and a weak e4 square.} Nd7 {Fritz actually prefers Nxf3, but I am not convinced - that exchange seems to help with rid himself of his weaknesses. I am planning Nf6-e4 at some stage.} 9. Ng5 {This seems a mistake - white is forcing black to castle, which black wants to do anyway. } O-O {So I castle.} 10. Rxf7 {This is an interesting combination, but ultimately unsound. White gains two pawns, but in return his knight is doomed on a8.} Rxf7 {So I take.} 11. Ne6 {Knight comes in.} Qe8 {Forced.} 12. Nxc7 {He takes.} Qd8 {Preventing the knight coming out again.} 13. Nxa8 {And he recaptures his rook.} Nf6 {Preparing to move my bishop on c8 to attack his knight with my queen.} 14. Qa4 {Attacking a7.} Nc6 {Protecting the a pawn. Fritz actually prefers 14......Bg4 here.} 15. Bb5 {White continues to attack, threatening to take twice on c6 and if 15....Bd7 then he can take on c6 followed by a7. The problem with this move is that white's queen-side is completely undeveloped, and hard to develop. His developed pieces are all over on the queen-side, leaving the king only protected by pawns. After a think, Fritz's evaluation of this position gradually gives black a bigger and bigger advantage - over plus 7 eventually! OK, so, given those clues, what would you play as black?} Ne4 {Fritz also gives Ng4 as a good alternative.} 16. Nd2 {As good as anything. What would you play now?} Qh4 {The best move, stopping white from playing 17. Nxe4 as Qe1+ is mating.} 17. Qd1 {Again the best defence. What would you play now?} Bg4 {Developing with tempo, black maintains his advantage.} 18. Be2 {And now?} Qf2+ {Did you find this? White picks up a bishop.} 19. Kh1 {Forced. Ok, take with bishop or queen, or play something else?} Bxe2 {This is best. No need to exchange our active queen for his passive queen.} 20. Qg1 {This is forced, otherwise white loses his queen immediately, or falls for a back-rank mate.} Qh4 {This is good - Fritz evaluates this position as plus 8.59 - but Fritz thinks that Bh6 is even better - plus 9.24 What is black threatening now?} 21. h3 {Black was threatening Nf2+ winning the white queen. What would you play now are black?} Nf2+ {The quickest finish. Fritz says this leads to mate in 6, as opposed to Ng3 which apparently is mate in 8} 22. Kh2 {Forced, unless white wants to give up queen for knight. What would you play now?} Nxh3 {I played this, and white resigned, rather spoiling my fun! I was rather hoping for 23. gxh3 Rf2+ 24. Qxf2 Qxf2+ 25. Kh1 Ne5 forcing mate. Interestingly I missed that black could have played 23. Ne5!! immediately forcing mate a lot quicker. Fritz pointed it out to me! Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system, to let me know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!}
