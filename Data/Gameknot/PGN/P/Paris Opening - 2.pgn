1. Nh3 {So we are off again in this weird opening} b5 {well that is daring, think I'll develop in the centre} 2. e4 a6 {I have no idea what black is playing at here} 3. d4 Bb7 {Despite my horrible knight I am happy with my position, and am going to develop slowly} 4. Bd3 e6 5. O-O Nf6 6. e5 {Black has the diagonal, but the black squared bishop is poor at the moment} Nd5 7. c3 c5 8. Qh5 {This was an error} h6 {However it provoked a response} 9. a3 cxd4 10. cxd4 Nc6 11. Be3 {Encouraging black to take the bishop as it opens up the f file and creates pressure on f7} Qb6 12. Qh4 {Caution } Be7 13. Qg4 g5 14. Nc3 Nxe3 15. fxe3 {Although it doesn't look pretty white has options and if black castles long a rook on c1 will cause problems, although white still has to be wary of the b7 bishop} d6 16. exd6 Bxd6 17. Qh5 Qc7 18. Nxg5 {Placing more pressure on black} O-O-O 19. Nxf7 Rhg8 20. Nxd8 Nxd8 {Black threatens the g2 square but white has an answer} 21. Be4 Kb8 22.
