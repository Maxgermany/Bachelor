1. e4 e5 {1...e5, standard defence for me with open games. (I'm gonna give a walk through of my brain during a game, lol, as want to annotate this game move by move inorder to help beginners - intermediate get a feel for the mental processes and ideas of basic strategy and tactics.)} 2. Nf3 Nc6 {(secretly hoping it's not going to be the Ruy)} 3. a3 Bc5 {Putting my dark-squared bishop on the outside of the newly forming pawn chain. And anticipating an Italian game.} 4. Nc3 d6 {Formed my pawn chain and am hoping to pin the f3 knight to the queen with Bg4.} 5. Bb5 Bg4 {(Bummer, it was a late Ruy after all, but still got to counter with the g4 pin.)} 6. h3 Bh5 {I still want to keep the pin in hopes of weaking kingside push of the g pawn.} 7. d3 h6 {7...h6 to deny thier bishop the same chance to pin my knight to my queen.} 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 {Naturally I take back, with sights on the newly opened b file for my rooks.} 9. g4 Bg6 {As I had hoped the kingside, in my mind, is dead to my opponent now.} 10. b4 Bb6 {Further weaking their queenside pawn structure also I now have the advantage no matter where the opponent decides to castle.} 11. Qe2 a5 {I decide to attack the queenside since my pawn structure is less hospitable to my own castling and there's a chance I can pin the c3 knight to the king.} 12. b5 Ne7 {I continue on developing rather than taking the b pawn inorder to gain tempo and to kingside castle.} 13. a4 O-O {I castle with intent on doubling the rooks sometime in the near future on the b file.} 14. Bb2 cxb5 {I capture to both undouble my pawns & progress my backward c pawn, as well make a spot for my knight on c6.} 15. Nxb5 c6 {I fight the knight away becacuse I don't want to give it any advanced support squares, esp. in the area where I plan to do battle.} 16. Nc3 Rb8 {eyeing the undefended bishop, I plan to discover check the bishop, so to speak, and win a pawn in the process.} 17. O-O Bxf2+ {Check! as planned they did not see it and they come up a pawn short.} 18. Qxf2 Rxb2 {I capture still intending to double the rooks on the b file.} 19. h4 h5 {I push the h pawn to prevent my bishop from being trapped and in hopes of further weaking the kingside.} 20. g5 f6 {I push the f  pawn still trying to clear out the kingside and free up my f8 rook to double up on the f file if need be.} 21. Qg2 Qb6+ {I move the queen to check in hopes of trading off the queens and atleast to allow safe passage for my f rook to double up on the b file.} 22. Kh1 fxg5 {I take g pawn weakening the kingside fully} 23. Nxg5 Rxf1+ {I trade rooks, abandoning my doubling plan, in hopes of simply reducing the enemy's overall offencive power and consequently it's potental for counter-attack. Trading pieces is encouraged when a you're up a pawn.} 24. Qxf1 Rxc2 {24. Qxf1 left the backward pawn hanging so I pick it up and now attack the c3 knight.} 25. Ne6 Qf2 {setting up for a mate in 2, I must block in hopes of a trade.} 26. Qh3 Rxc3 {Still refusing to trade queens, I pick up a free piece in the process.} 27. Rf1 Bxe4+ {BOOM! I'd like to say that I was planning this move from the start or atleast from 4 moves earlier, but no. After a little guess work & imagination I found it and was happy with the resulting forced mate. White resigned.}
