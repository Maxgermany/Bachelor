1. d4 {The Queen pawn games are quickly replacing e4 as the 1st move of choice at top level of play.  } d5 2. c4 e6 {Queens gambit declined one of my favorites. It has the rep of being a quiet game but it does have some very flashy variations.   } 3. Nf3 {The fashionable choice that avoids the Nimzo-Indain.  } Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 {Semi-Slav is a very solid defensive choice.  } 5. e3 {Wow Ratkop is playing like his mentor(which is me) this is exactly what I play most of the time. As I always say to my students consolidating your centre and develop your pieces is paramount.  } Nbd7 6. Be2 {Discouraging potential king side play by black via ...Nh5 } Bd6 7. O-O O-O 8. c5 {!? not my choice of move. For one it greatly reduces the tension in the center which benefits black more than white. Secondly, white makes a pawn move when there are pieces that need developing. I would have played 8. Qc2  Alternative variation: 8. Qc2 dxc4 9. Bxc4 b5 10. Bd3 [⩲] } Bb8 9. b4 {It is good to see that white has a clear simple plan here. His idea is to gain space on the queen side with the hope of creating a passer later on.  } a6 10. Bb2 e5 11. Re1 {Nice move, appreciating the fact that black may wish to open the e-file at some point. But it creates a significant weakness on f2.  } e4 12. Nd2 {The centre is closed and subtle manoeuvrings to improve your pieces becomes the priority. Lets see how white does.  } Ne8 13. Nf1 f5 14. Qb3 {So far so good. Now any opening of the position should benefit white.  } Nef6 15. a4 {White has great potential on the queen side which is counter by black's advancing  f-pawn. Still white has the poorly placed knight on f1 which he will have to resolve before getting on with the attack. All that being said the game can go in either direction. Long term I like white's chances.  } f4 16. exf4 Bxf4 17. b5 Kh8 {!? Alternative variation: 17... Rf7 [!?] 18. Ne3 Nf8 19. Ncd1 Ne6 20. g3 Bxe3 21. Nxe3 Ng5 [⩱] } 18. g3 Bh6 19. Bc1 {?! trading the DSB when your major weakness is on the dark squares(f2) is not a good idea. Alternative variation: 19. Rab1 axb5 20. axb5 Ng8 21. Nd1 Ndf6 22. Nfe3 [⩲] } Bxc1 20. Rexc1 Ne8 {exposing the weakness of f2 } 21. bxc6 bxc6 22. Qc2 {?! Alternative variation: 22. Nd1 [only move] 22... Qf6 23. Qc3 Nc7 24. Rc2 Ne6 25. Rd2 Ng5 26. Nfe3 [⩱] } Qf6 23. Qd2 Qxf2+ 24. Kh1 Ndf6 {White is in serious trouble.  } 25. Nd1 Qf5 26. Nfe3 Qg6 27. Rab1 {White's road to salvation is down the b-file but will it be enough! } Ng4 28. Rb6 {Nice active defensive in a desperate situation. At least white is giving black something to think about!  } Nf2+ {?? Alternative variation: [ ⌓ ] 28... Nc7 29. Kg1 Qh6 30. h4 a5 31. Rc2 Qg6 32. Qe1 [−⁠+] } 29. Nxf2 Rxf2 30. Kg1 Rf6 31. Rf1 {and white is back in the game.  } Rxf1+ 32. Bxf1 Qe6 33. a5 Nc7 {?! Alternative variation: [ A draw by rep is ] 33... Nf6 34. Be2 Kg8 35. Qd1 h5 36. Qf1 Bd7 37. Qf4 Rf8 38. Bxa6 Ne8 39. Qg5 Qf7 40. Qf4 Qe6 } 34. Qf2 h6 35. Be2 {Alternative variation: 35. Qf8+ [!?] 35... Kh7 36. Qd6 Qxd6 37. cxd6 Nb5 38. Bxb5 axb5 39. Rxc6 [±] } Nb5 36. Qf8+ Kh7 37. Bg4 Qf6 {?? Alternative variation: 37... Qg8 38. Qxg8+ Kxg8 39. Bxc8 Rxc8 40. Nc2 [=] } 38. Qxf6 gxf6 39. Bxc8 {?? Alternative variation: 39. Rxc6 Bxg4 40. Nxg4 Kg7 41. Nxf6 Nxd4 42. Nh5+ Kg8 43. Rg6+ Kf7 44. Rg7+ Ke6 45. Nf4+ Kf6 46. Rh7 } Rxc8 40. Nc2 Kg6 {Alternative variation: 40... h5 41. h4 e3 42. Rxa6 Kg6 43. Nxe3 Nxd4 44. Rb6 Nf3+ 45. Kf2 [⩲] } 41. Rxa6 Kg5 {?? The losing blunder.  } 42. Kf2 Kg4 43. Ne3+ Kh3 44. Nf5 Kg4 45. Nxh6+ {Excellent endgame technique by white.  } Kh3 46. Nf5 Kxh2 47. Nd6 Rg8 48. Nxb5 cxb5 49. Rxf6 {White finally creates his passer and wins the game. The rest is an exercise in endgame play. Well done by white.  } Kh3 50. a6 Kg4 51. a7 Ra8 52. Rf7 b4 53. Rb7 b3 54. c6 b2 55. c7 {Ratkop pulls a rabbit out of his hat! Well done. }
