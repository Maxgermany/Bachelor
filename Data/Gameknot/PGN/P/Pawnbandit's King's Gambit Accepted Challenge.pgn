1. e4 {This game is from another King's Gambit Accepted tournament I joined. In this game I had the black pieces.} e5 2. f4 exf4 {This is the position the games were started in. White to move.} 3. Bc4 {A very strange looking move. I believe it to be a bad move. I've talked to my opponent about this particular move after the game. He believes it's OK.} Qh4+ {It can be dangerous to move the Queen out just three moves into the game. But in this position I believe it to be alright. White can play 3 things. I think them all to be bad. } 4. Kf1 {This would be the best of the moves. It can be ok though. White can play Nf3 kicking out the Queen and moving Kf6 followed by Rf1 or Rf2.} g5 {Now my obvious idea is to rush a King side attack.} 5. Nc3 {Maybe white could still have play Nf3.} g4 {Stopping the Knight to get where it should be.} 6. d4 {Good move. Attack the f pawn while gaining center control.} Nf6 {I blundered here. I could have played Bh6.} 7. g3 {I think white should have taken the pawn. I don't see the logic in this move.} fxg3 {Maybe to double my pawns. That's fine for black. } 8. Kg2 {Making is possible to play hxg3.} Nh5 {Moving the Knight twice. Maybe black had a better move? Push a pawn or develop the dark squared Bishop.} 9. Nd5 {Threatening Nc7  winning the rook. Black can't play Bd6 or Na6 to guard the c7 square. If Bd7 then e5. If Na6 then Bxa6.} Kd8 {Obvious. } 10. Qe1 {Good move. Pinning the g3 pawn as well as threatening to play Qa5.} c6 {At this point I noticed a rook fork for white. And this doesn't prevent it.} 11. Nc7 Kxc7 12. Qa5+ b6 13. Qe5+ {There it is. Which is OK for black. You will see why.} Bd6 {Now black has its dark squared bishop right where it should be.} 14. Qxh8 {The Queen is now out of the game. For good} gxh2 {White can't take back.} 15. e5 {Good defensive move from white. But it gives black the tempo back.} Qg3+ 16. Kf1 {This was forced.} Bb4 {Moving the bishop to safety. Threatening Be1 followed by Qf2#.} 17. c3 {This stops black temporarily. If at all. } hxg1=Q+ 18. Rxg1 Qf3+ 19. Ke1 {Forced.} g3 {Threatening to win back the Rook. Notice the white Queen hasn't had a chance to jump back into the game. And black has won the exchange for the black Rook.} 20. Rf1 Bxc3+ {Now threatening the Rook on a1.  21. bxc3    Qxb3  22. Bd2     Qxa1} 21. Bd2 {Much worse than losing the rook, white has just lost the game.} Qe3+ {It is forced from here.} 22. Kd1 {White could have also played Be2. The result wold have been the same.} Qxd2# {THE END.  GOOD GAME  }
