[Opening "English opening (A22)"]

1. c4 {The English opening is very flexible and often transposes into other openings.  It was named for the unofficial English world champion, Howard Staunton, who played it during a match in 1843.} e5 {1...e5 often leads to a transposed Sicilean defense, in which white has an extra tempo.} 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. e3 {Prepares for a d pawn push to d4.} c5 {Prevents d4.} 4. g3 {Opens the long diagonal for the bishop.  This weakens the kingside castle slightly and seems unnecessary since the bishop can be developed via e2.  Edit:  sicilian_monster pointed out that g3 followed by Bg2 is strong because of the fianchettoed bishop, especially since black has already played c5, weakening his queenside.  He further commented that it should be met by d5 because of the advanced e pawn and weak d3 square.} Nc6 5. Bg2 {The fianchettoed bishop puts a lot of pressure on black's queenside and controls the critical central squares e4 and d5.} Be7 {Preparing to castle.} 6. Nge2 {This may be what White had in mind when he played 4. g3.  If white had played Nf3, then e4 would have forced the knight to move again, though supporting the pawn with d5 or f5 would be problematic.  The knight supports a d4 push if White were interested in clearing the center and opening the game.} O-O 7. b3 {Perparing for Bb2, fianchettoing the 2nd bishop.} d6 8. h3 Be6 {The d5 square is weak due to black's advanced c and e pawns.  Black is forced to defend it with pieces rather than pawns.  I played this move thinking to prevent Nd5, but realized a move later that it encourages white to occupy it since Nxd5, cxd5 forks black's knight and bishop.    Bf5 is better.} 9. Nd5 {The centralized knight is strong and puts pressure on most of black's central structure.} Rb8 {I had originally planned to play Qd7 further pressuring h3 and preventing white from castling.  After Nd5, I decided against it but believe it would have been the better move since it would have protected both b7 and c6.  Rb8 supports the b pawn, which I had planned to advance, and removed the rook from the long diagonal.} 10. a3 b5 {? (Bad move)  The push I was thinking of, overlooking the fact that my c6 knight is unprotected and that Nxf6  forces a reply.} 11. Nxf6+ {! (good move)} Bxf6 12. Bxc6 bxc4 {Once I lose material, I feel I need to resolve things quickly, before my opponent can bring his extra material to bare or we simplify to a lost endgame.  This opens the b file and prevents Bb2 without preparation.} 13. bxc4 e4 {Threatening Bxa1 and wishing for something like 14. Ra2 Bxc4 15. Bxc4 and winning some material back.} 14. Nc3 {My opponent was too canny to give up a rook so easily.} Bxc4 {! (Good move)  This was played to prevent castling.  I hold the a6-f1 diagonal for most of the midgame, imprisoning white's rook in the corner. } 15. Rb1 Rxb1 {I would prefer not to trade, but didn't want to surrender the b file either.  Besides, this forced white to use tempo redeveloping his knight and gave me time to defend my advanced e pawn.} 16. Nxb1 d5 17. Nc3 a6 {Prevents Bb5.} 18. Ne2 {Preparing to castle.} h5 {Attacks the castled position.  I was a little afraid of opening the g file, but thought my dark bishop would adaquately protect me. } 19. Qc2 {Giving up on castling since the white king is all that protects white's knight.  Preparing for Bb2, finally developing his remaining pieces.} h4 20. g4 {?! (Dubious)  gxh4 would have opened the g file for counterplay, which would have been dangerous for Black after Rg1 and Bb2; however, this also prevented Black from invading on the kingside.} Be5 {Preparing to advance the f pawn and half open the f file for my rook.} 21. Bb2 f6 {With the option for a trade, I decided that opening the f file while strengthening my pawn center was much better.  This also prevented counterplay on the g file.} 22. Bxe5 {White commented that he traded because he felt my bishop was stronger than his.} fxe5 23. Ba4 {Avoiding the threat of 23. Qf6, forking the bishop and f pawn.} Qf6 {I spent a lot of time studying the next few positions, but still unsure if I had anything better.} 24. Rh2 {Stronger than Rf1, which would have abandoned the h pawn to Qf3, Qd1 Qxh3.} Rb8 {Controlling the b file and preparing for Bd3 followed by Rb1.  24...Qf3 25. Qd1 Rb8 may be slightly stronger, but it also fails to Nc3.} 25. Nc3 {! (Good move)} Kh8 {I was afraid of 26. Nxe4 dxe4 27. Qxc4 , taking initiative and destroying my pawn center.  Bd3!? was considered, but was delayed due to the possibility of 26. Nxd5 Qf3 (Bxc2? 27. Nxf6  Rf6 28. Bxc2, losing two pawns.) 27. Nd7 .  There were far too many checks available with my king on g8.  Looking back now, I don't think White could have sustained the checks and after an eventual white move of Bd1, Rb1 should have sealed the game.} 26. Nxe4 {Exactly what I feared, without the fatal check.  Qf3 goes no where after 27. Nc3, when I'm a pawn down for nothing.} dxe4 27. Qxc4 Rb1+ 28. Bd1 {Not Ke2 Qf3#.} Qf3 29. Qe2 {I expected 29. Qc2 Ra1 30. d3, but think this is stronger.} c4 {Preventing an eventual d3, allowing the trade since exf3 with trap the white king.} 30. Qxf3 exf3 31. Rh1 {?? (Blunder)  g5 was required to allow white to escape the prison.  This begins a series of passive moves that allow black to centralize his king and retain control of the game.} g5 {! (Good move)  White is almost completely trapped.  The only play he really has at this point is 32. d4 (or d3) c3! prevents the king from moving  and seems to lead to a draw, which black should be happy with.  32...dxc3? 33. Kd2 e4 34. Kc3 Kg7 wins for white.} 32. Rg1 Kg7 {e4 is better, though at the time I thought I needed to centralize my king immediately.} 33. e4 Kf6 34. Rf1 Ke6 35. Rh1 Kd6 36. Rf1 Ra1 {Looking for anything other than a draw.} 37. Rg1 Kc5 {?! (Dubious)  This allows white to play d4  and finally escape.  Prior to this, I was about to offer a draw, but was still trying to see if I could force something.} 38. d4+ Kxd4 {After a lot of thought, I decided to capture with my king.  That prevents white from gaining a passed e pawn, which would require babysitting.  The paired passed pawns of mine would be a huge threat, but I couldn't find a way to force the two pawns through.  Edit: emf817 pointed out that cxd3ep is an excellent play:  39. Kd2 Kd4 40. Rh1 (Re1? Ra2  41. Kc1 d2  queens) Ra2 41. Ke1 Kxe4 and black has a protected passed pawn while white remains trapped.  A few moves earlier, I was set on the c pawn blocking d2 before pushing on for a queen, then didn't reconsider it when needed.} 39. Kd2 c3+ 40. Kc2 Kc4 {Prevents White from escaping to cause mischief.  Edit:  sicilian_monster pointed out this is a horrible mistake because of the possibility of 41. Be2 .} 41. Re1 {Rh1 followed by Bxf3 is probably stronger.  Edit:  sicilian_monster pointed out that Be2 !!, winning black's rook (and the game), is the best move here.  41. Be2  fxe2 42. Rxa1 a5 43. Re1, etc.} Ra2+ {Rxa3 42. Bxf3 Ra2  43. Kc1 Rxf2 might be interesting because it frees my a pawn, but would allow white more counterplay.} 42. Kb1 {? (Bad move)  Kc1 is better as this allows me to capture his c pawn and defend mine with check.  42...Rxf2 43. Re3 a5 44. Rxf3 Rxf3 45. Bxf3 Kb3 and the game seems drawn.} Rxf2 43. Re3 Rb2+ 44. Kc1 f2 45. Rf3 {Threatening 46. Bc2 followed by Rxf2.} Rd2 46. Bc2 Kd4 {White has no useful moves at this point and is almost at zugzwang, German for "compelled to move", at which point any possible moves loses.  After 47. a4 a5, he's forced to abandon protection of his e3 or e4, either losing his pawn or allowing the black king to penetrate.  48. Rf8 Ke3 49. Rf5 Rxc2  (Re2 50. Bd1 Rd2 (Re1? 51. Rf3  loses black's f pawn) 51. Bc2) 50. Kxc2 Ke2 51. Kxc3 f1=Q 52. Rxf1 Kxf1 53. Kc4 Kg2 and white's h pawn queens first.} 47. Bd1 {? (Bad move).  White doesn't have many options at this point, but abandoning defense of the e pawn is one of the quickest ways to lose.} Kxe4 48. a4 a5 {Black probably doesn't need to worry about his a pawn at this point, but it seemed wise to move it off of white, to prevent capture by white's bishop if things went wrong.} 49. Rf5 Kd4 {0-1  White resigned at this point, as black can push his e pawn and should be able to queen one or the other.
