[White "Sarasani "]

[Opening "QGD (D06), Marshall defence"]

1. d4 {1.d4 is my standard opening move with white, so my repertoire mostly contains openings like Queens Gambit, Slav or semi-slav, King's-Queens or Nimzo Indian, Grunfeld, Benko Gambit and Modern Defence systems. With black I only play the Sicilian (Najdorf) against 1.e4.} d5 2. c4 {D06: Queens Gambit. Of course black can play 2...c6, entering the Slav defence.} Nf6 {? But this is not the strongest continuation. Of course its playable, but white usually gets a good position.} 3. cxd5 {The best move of course. Black can't avoid losing a tempo.} Nxd5 {If 3...Qxd5? then ofcourse 4.Nc3.} 4. e4 {But now white can play e4 straightaway, which is often the goal in these kind of positions. } Nb6 {last bookmove. } 5. Bd3 {?! I decided to set up a cheap trick, but at the same time develop my bishop.} e6 {Of course the d4 is poisoned, due to Bb5+, but here black missed a chance to equalise with 5... e5! followed by something like 6. dxe5 Nc6. } 6. Nc3 {Black is somewhat behind in development. } Bb4 {I think 6... Be7 is slightly better. } 7. Nf3 Bxc3+ {? Black is already behind in development, so 7... Nc6 was the most logical continuation.  } 8. bxc3 {White is already 'winning' here. Control of the centre, lead in development, space on the king side and let's not forget the Bishop pair.} Nc6 {Finally the knight comes into play.} 9. O-O Bd7 {? I don't like this move. He should have played 9... O-O while he still had the chance. } 10. Ba3 {But now dark clouds are gathering in the sky. From this square the bishop prevents black from castling.} h6 {?? Best was 10... Qf6 and then castling queen side, but this move allows white to come up with a nice tactical blow, so try to find the best move for white now. } 11. d5 {! Did you find it? } exd5 {? I was expecting 11... Ne7 and then 12. c4. But black apparently just goes along with the ride.} 12. exd5 {Now the e-file is opened up of course.} Nxd5 {The knight now attacks the pawn on c3, but white simply ignores the threat and instead heads for the scalp of the enemy king.} 13. Re1+ {Check, your majesty!} Be6 {13... Nce7 loses to 14.c4 and 13...Nde7 14.Bb5 Be6 15.Nd4 isn't much better either. } 14. Bc4 {Here 14. Rxe6+! seems even stronger. 14... fxe6 15. Bg6+ Kd7 16. c4.  } Nxc3 {?? Putting an end to his misery. Though 14... Nb6 15. Rxe6+ fxe6 16. Qe2 again isn't much of an improvement.  } 15. Qc2 {15. Qb3 was the best move here, followed by something like 15... Qd7 16. Rxe6+ fxe6 17. Bxe6. } Nxa2 {? 15... Qf6 was the last chance, but of course 16. Bb2 wins the knight. } 16. Qxa2 {Here I missed a very nice win. Black has won three pawns for the knight so material is now even. But instead white should have played 16. Rxe6+! Kd7 (if 16... fxe6? then 17.Qg6 mates next move) 17. Rd1+ Kc8 18. Rxd8+ Rxd8 19. Rxc6 Rd7 20. Qf5 Nb4 21. Ne5 bxc6 22. Qxd7+ Kb7 23. Bxb4 Rh8 24. Qxc6+ Kb8 25. Ba6 Rd8 26. Qb7# } Nd4 {16... Qd7 was the last chance. 17. Bxe6 fxe6 18. Rad1. } 17. Nxd4 {Eliminating the defender of e6.} Qxd4 18. Bxe6 {The end is in sight.} fxe6 {Now it's mate in five. 18... c5 won't help anymore. 19. Bxf7+ Kd7 20. Rad1 Rag8 21. Rxd4+ Kc8 22. Qe6+ Kb8 23. Qd6+ Ka8 24. Bxg8 a6 25. Re8+ Ka7 26. Bxc5+ b6 27. Qxb6#.   } 19. Qxe6+ {The king has only one square.} Kd8 {And now there's a standard mating pattern which usually occurs with the white bishop. (1.Bh7+ Kh8 2.Bg6+ Kg8 3.Qh7+ Kf8 4.Qxf7#)} 20. Be7+ {! } Ke8 21. Bf6+ {Also attacking the black queen.} Kf8 22. Qe7+ {But the king is of much more value of course.} Kg8 23. Qxg7# {Checkmate. Hope you enjoyed this game, cheers!}
