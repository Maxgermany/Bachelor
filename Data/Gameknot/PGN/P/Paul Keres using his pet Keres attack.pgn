1. e4 { The Paul Keres faveroute move!} c5 { Sicilian Defence.} 2. Ne2 { rather weird but it is fine} e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {  Note that it would be exacly the same position if White played 2.Nf3 instead. 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4. Nxf3 same thing as this position!} Nf6 5. Nc3 { This is now normal.} d6 6. g4 { This is the Keres attack!} Nc6 { h6 should have been played instead to prevent White's next move...} 7. g5 { Which is this.} Nxd4 { Exchange} 8. Qxd4 { recapture.} Nd7 { Knight retreats} 9. Be3 { This move gives White the right to 0-0-0 if he wishes,and develops a piece to where it stands best.} a6 { To prevent 10.Nb5 and also gives him the chance for a possible 10.b5} 10. Be2 { Now White can castle either side.} Qc7 { To help out the d-pawn.} 11. f4 { Playing for an attack on the King side.} b6 { Allows Black the chance to fianchetto his bishop.} 12. f5 { White expects a reaction that will lead for Black to have future problems.} Ne5 { So the Bishop supports the e-pawn and to help Black gain some space.} 13. fxe6 { } fxe6 { If 13.Bxe6 then the d-pawn is isolated.} 14. a4 { stop a future b5.} Be7 { To give Black the possibility to 0-0.} 15. h4 {to support the g-pawn.} Qc5 16. Qd2 { Introducing a threat to the Black Queen.} Qc7 17. Rf1 { To stop Black 0-0.} Bb7 { To give Black the oppourtunity to 0-0-0 which I think he should have took.} 18. Bd4 { White is improving his piece play.} Rf8 { Black challenges White for the f-file.} 19. O-O-O { White brings his King to safety and also connects his Rooks.} Rxf1 { I don't think that Black should have exchanged at this point.} 20. Rxf1 { Recapture.} Bd8 { I don't see the point of this move.} 21. Qf4 { This threatens 22.Qf8  Kd7  23. Qxg7  which is winning for White.} Ng6 { Attacking  the Queen and also stopping the Queen from going to f8, which is deadly.} 22. Qg4 { This threatens the fairly obvious threat of 23.Qxe6 } Qe7 23. Qh5 { White threatens the h7 pawn and also pins the Knight to the King so that means the Knight can't defend the h7 pawn with Nf8.} e5 { This move threartens the Bishop.} 24. Be3 { The Bishop retreats.} Bc7 { Black will need to 0-0-0 to keep his King safer and to bring his Rook into play, which is doing nothing at all.} 25. Qxh7 {Nothing could be done to save the h7 pawn. But now the Knight is being threatened and it can be saved.} Nf4 { That is one way. But also everything else is losing for Black.} 26. Bxf4 { an exchange} exf4 { recapture.} 27. Bh5+ { Check.} Kd7 28. Bg4+ Kc6 29. Qf5 { 30. Qd5 checkmate is now being threatened.} b5 { To give the Black King some luft ( luft I belive is the German word for breathing space!) which is the b6 square.} 30. Qd5+ {White does it anyway simpily because it is still winning!} Kb6 {Black's only move.} 31. Qd4+ { } Kc6 { The alternative 31. Ka5 is met by 32. b4 checkmate!} 32. Nd5 { Black resigned here. great game!!}
