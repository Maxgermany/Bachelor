[Opening "Sicilian (B33), Pelikan, Chelyabinsk variation"]

1. e4 c5 {I believe this is the best reply to 1. e4 and because it's so good I have a hard time convincing myself to learn a second defence to 1. e4. The Sicilian is so rich with ideas and the games are very dynamic and full with counter-chances for Black, something you really don't get in other openings. The only other opening I dabble in is the Alekhine, but that's just for blitz purposes. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The open Sicilian. The battleground on which many games have been fought and there is still some discussion on the correctness of White's approach. Some have called this exchange positionally wrong but in practice White has a lot of attacking chances.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {The only problem I have with this defence is that White can avoid it. Other than that, I still haven't found a line that causes me great a deal of concern.} 6. Ndb5 {The best move. Many beginners or amateurs play 6. Nxc6 after which White is worse. } d6 {6...a6 is a dubious variation that might work out in OTB but in CC it would just be asking for trouble.} 7. Bg5 {The most aggressive approach. Trying to play slow in the Sicilian is tantamount to an early resignation.} a6 8. Na3 b5 {Here White has to deal with the threat of b4 and he can do this in two ways. The positional line, that was my opponent play and the sharper line, exchanging on f6, after which there are many lines and many ideas for both sides.} 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3 Ne7 {A rather recent development and a personal favourite. Black decides that he doesn't mind the doubled pawns and doesn't want to let White settle in with Nc2 and a4.} 12. Nxf6+ {Playing 12. Nc2 doesn't promise much after 12...Nxd5 13. Qxd5 Rb8. After 12. Nxe7 Bxe7, Black will soon play either f5 or d5 and open up lines for his two Bishops.} gxf6 13. Bd3 {13. c4 is the more brutal way of playing but after 13...Bb7 14. cxb5 Bxe4 15. Qa4 d5 16. bxa6+ Kf8, Black has enough compensation.} d5 {One of the perks of this system is that you can play d5 early and get rid of the weak pawn.} 14. Qe2 {A sensible move, White develops his Queen and overprotects e4. There is another fine point to this move. White is waiting to see what I'm going to do about the King. There are a few positions where an early castle is very perilous. } Be6 {Not particularly spirited, developing on the long diagonal was probably better at this point, but after that the elegance of White's 14th is revealed. White could reply with 15. 0-0-0, now that the Bishop is aimed at the K-side, White places the King on the other flank. However, Black's best move is 14...Ng6 and after 15. g3 d4 16. cxd4 Qxd4 17. Rd1 Qb4+ 18. Qd2 Qxd2+ 19. Rxd2 h5, there is still a tense struggle going on on both sides of the board.} 15. Nc2 {The bad Knight is getting recycled and sent to a better spot. White is still in no rush to castle.} Qb6 {The best place for the Queen in this line. This is connected to castling long, since without the dark square Bishop, the K-side is a perilous place.} 16. Ne3 {White has regrouped his pieces and is now ready to castle.} O-O-O {Castling long looks risky, the pawn shield is rather scarce but like in other lines of the Sveshnikov, attack is the best form of defence.} 17. Qc2 {It looks like White wants to take complete control of e4 and f5. Also the Queen is very well placed for an a4 strike.} Rhg8 {The advantage of doubled pawns are open lines. I activate my Rook and prompt White to castle.} 18. O-O {18. a4 leads to a forced sequence where most of the pieces come off after 18...dxe4 19. Bxe4 f5 20. Nxf5 Nxf5 21. Bxf5 Rxg2 22. axb5 axb5 23. Ra8+ Kc7 24. Rxd8 Kxd8 25. Bxe6 Qxe6 26. Qxh7. White has won a pawn but the ending is about equal.} Kb8 {Taking precautions that a White Rook won't land on a8.} 19. Rfd1 {White wants to activate all of his pieces before attacking the Black King. Exchanging on d5 leads to a drawish endgame after 19. exd5 Nxd5 20. Nxd5 Bxd5 21. Be4 Bxe4 22. Qxe4 Qb7 23. Qxb7+ Kxb7. An interesting possibility was 19. a4 when it's difficult to find a good answer for Black.} d4 {Opening lines against my King but with the Rook on d1 I didn't want to let White exchange on d5.} 20. cxd4 exd4 21. Nf5 {A typical position for this line. My pawn structure is a disaster but I have slightly more space, the piece are a shade more active and Rooks are better placed. The main cause for concern is my King safety.} Ng6 {Avoiding an exchange of pieces because my best chance is to muster an attack.} 22. Nh6 {Forcing a misplacement of the Rook at the cost of misplacing the Knight as well.} Rg7 {It's best to stay on this file, otherwise I'm left without any good plans.} 23. g3 {Securing the g-pawn and giving the King a breather.} Ne5 {Centralizing the Knight but its spot isn't very secure.} 24. Rac1 {Here White missed a chance to take over the initiative with 24. f4, and the Black Knight has three moves but neither is particularly good.} Rc8 {Taking care of things on the c-file.} 25. Qe2 Rxc1 26. Rxc1 Bxa2 {At least the a-pawn won't bother my King's pawn shelter now.} 27. Nf5 {Bring the Knight back into the fray with tempo.} Rg8 28. f4 {This move comes too late. I have no qualms over exchanging pieces now.} Nxd3 29. Qxd3 Rd8 {Defending the passed pawn. At around this move I saw that White could force a draw but I didn't think much of it.} 30. b3 {A small punishment for gluttony.} Qe6 {White has no good defence for the b3 pawn and the guard becomes the prisoner now. But here White proved his good understanding of the position and went for my King.} 31. Qd2 {I envisioned the ending that would arise after 31. Qc2 Rc8 32. Qxc8+ Qxc8 33. Rxc8+ Kxc8 34. Nd4 Bb1 where I would have good prospects to make my extra pawn count. But White thought nothing of it.} Bxb3 {Not much else to do.} 32. Qa5 {And here it come. White wants to give a perpetual on the dark squares.} Rd7 33. Nxd4 Qxe4 {I didn't want to concede and played for more while accepting less. There was no doubt that White has a better ending but I hopped that I could secure good chances with two pawns for the Knight. My opponent must have been pleased with my decision.} 34. Qb6+ Qb7 35. Qxb7+ Kxb7 36. Nxb3 Kb6 {This ending is very treacherous and for a particular reason. My K-side pawn structure is in shambles and should it come under attack, the pawns will drop like flies. If there were no Rooks on the board it would be even worse. But I thought I could advance the pawns faster than the White King could march to the Q-side and free the Knight to go on a rampage on the K-side.} 37. Kf2 a5 38. Ke3 a4 39. Nd4 {Now White can begin to attack my pawns.} Ka5 {I realized that my best chance was to trade the two pawns for the Knight and try to level the game in the Rook endgame.} 40. Rc5 {White could have postponed this decision but it's very instructive that he didn't. He can't improve his position and pushing pawns on the K-side only helps me since he would be taking away entry points for his pieces. Also 40. Kd3 fails to 40...a3 and if White tries to play 41. Rc5 he's suddenly lost after 41...a2.} Kb4 41. Rxb5+ Kc4 42. Ra5 Re7+ {Very important or else I can't capture the Knight because of Rxa4+.} 43. Kf3 Kxd4 44. Rxa4+ Kd5 {I thought I could hold this position but there is a particular line that wins for White. The winning move is 45. Kg4!. The King is the best attacker here and after 45...Re2 46. Kf5! Rxh2 47. Kxf6 Rg2 48. Kxf7 Rxg3 49. f5 with a typical won Rook endgame.} 45. Ra6 {After this I escape by the skin of my teeth.} f5 46. Rf6 Ra7 47. Rxf5+ Ke6 {The main reason why 45. Kg4 was winning was because White could get his King in front of the pawn and my King couldn't do anything about the march of the f-pawn.} 48. g4 Ra3+ 49. Kf2 f6 50. Rh5 {Going for a forced line that leads to a drawn K+K endgame.} Ra7 51. Rh6 Rg7 52. g5 {This looks decisive but it really isn't.} Rg6 {I force the exchange of Rooks and get a pawn on g6 after which I can hold off the White King from achieving anything.} 53. Rxg6 hxg6 54. h4 fxg5 55. fxg5 Ke5 56. Kf3 Kf5 57. Kg3 {My opponent realized there was no way to win here so he offered a draw which I accepted.}
