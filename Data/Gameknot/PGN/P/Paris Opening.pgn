1. Nh3 {so we start with this horrible knight} d5 2. g3 Be6 {this is a weak move as it prevents e5 or e6, I figur black is going to develop the bishop via g7} 3. Bg2 c6 4. O-O g6 5. d4 {White is ok at the moment } Qd7 {White can get his knight out of trouble now} 6. Ng5 h6 {Black gives up the bishop, white is really looking stronger now. I think this is an error} 7. Nxe6 Qxe6 8. Re1 {Black is behind in development white wants to play e4 and open a file up} Bg7 9. e4 dxe4 10. Rxe4 Qd6 11. Bf4 {White develops another piece} Qd7 12. c3 {black should play n f3 but chooses something very different} Na6 {I presume that Black is thinking of playing c5 or preparing to castle} 13. Qe2 Bf6 {This is a poor move, catling or developing the knight would have been better} 14. Na3 {i put the knight out of position to allow my bishop to retreat to d2 or c1 if needed} e6 {Again another nothing move} 15. Nc4 {Black cannot castle long now as o-o-o is met with k -d6+ which leeds to a discovered check and the loss of a rook} Be7 16. Bh3 {Placing the bishop on h3 with the idea that black may castle long, this diagonal may prove useful} f5 {Big mistake, black lets white in, rxp} 17. Rxe6 Nc7 {Time to simplify, the knight is the only active minor piece for black and so the exchange works} 18. Bxc7 Qxc7 19. Ne5 {Again preventing black from castling and maintaining pressure on the black king} Rh7 20. Rxg6 {White is slowly taking black apart} O-O-O {finally black castles but the white bishop is about to make an entrance} 21. Bxf5+ {After the king moves to b8, r wii take the knight and then take the rook with the bishop winning a piece} Kb8 22. Rxg8 Rxg8 23. Bxh7 Rg5 24. Re1 Bf6 25. f4 Rg7 26. Bf5 a6 27. Qh5 {White maintains pressure and is now searching to simplify as the ending is academic} Bxe5 28. Rxe5 Ka7 29. Qxh6 Rf7 30. Qe6 Rg7 31. Qc4 b5 32. Qc5+ Kb7 33. Be4 {White keeps the black queen tied up defending the pawn, black has nothing on here} a5 {White has the opportnity for another pawn} 34. Qxb5+ Ka7 35. Qxa5+ {Time to remove the queens} Qxa5 36. Rxa5+ Kb6 37. Rc5 Re7 {White simply takes the pawn} 38. Rxc6+ Kb5 39. Rc5+ Kb6 40. Re5 {This is hopeless for black, but he gamely carries on} Ra7 41. Re6+ Kb5 42. Bd3+ {this forces the king on to the A file, white will then push the f pawn, black is unable to move from the a file because of R-a6 mate} Ka4 43. f5 Rf7 {Game over} 44. Ra6# {}
