1. d4 {I recommend using the "interactive" option to view annotated games.} c6 2. c4 d5 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nc3 dxc4 {Black accepts the gambit.} 5. a4 {Since I already played Nf3, e3 could be met by b5, and now a4 wouldn't work because of ... b4.} Bb4 {Even though I can't kick the bishop immediately, it doesn't mean b4 is a good square.} 6. e3 {I would play Bg5 if he played Nf6 on the previous move, but since he didn't I opted for a safer e3 option.} Nf6 7. Bxc4 {It is only natural to take the pawn now, the Knights are out and it prepares white for castling.} Bxc3+ {a ? move, black is giving away his good bishop for free.} 8. bxc3 O-O 9. O-O Ne4 {The knight attacks c3 but it's a bad move. Black shouldn't move the same piece again at least until he develops his other knight (on d7).} 10. Bb2 {maybe if black's knight wasn't there Ba3 would be better.} Qd7 {takes away a square for both the knight and the bishop, so not very good.} 11. Qc2 {attacking the knight} c5 {attacking the centre but leaving the knight en prise} 12. Qxe4 f5 {now it's a matter of technique from white and resistance from black.} 13. Qh4 {threatening Ng5 and Qxh6++, mate.} h6 {good move} 14. Rfd1 {I don't remember what I was planning to do with the rook, but now I see that if cxd4, Rxd4 may be possible.} b6 {b6 defends c5 and allows the black's bishop to go on b7, but I think Qc7 would be better since it opens up d7.} 15. dxc5 {and also it seems that I can take c5 anyway because of the rook. Maybe that was the idea of fRd1.} Qc6 {again the queen moves to a light square, which is not the problem right now.} 16. Bb5 {I want to gain a tempo and unblock my c3 pawn.} Qc7 {Finally the queen is on c7.} 17. cxb6 Qxb6 18. Ne5 {This sets up a tactic against the black king.} Na6 {the only move for the knight.} 19. Ng6 Rf6 {I didn't expect this move. I thought leonard would play Rf7, which allows Rd8 check (the black queen can't take), then Kh7 Nf8+ Kg8 Nd7+ winning the queen.} 20. Ne7+ {I wanted a quick finish and this felt right.} Kf7 21. Qh5+ {If g6, Nxg6. If rook takes knight, Be8+. If Kg7, c4. If Kg8, Qxh6.} Kxe7 {The knight couldn't be taken because} 22. Qe8# {}
