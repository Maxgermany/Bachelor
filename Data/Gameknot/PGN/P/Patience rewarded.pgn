[Opening "Old Indian (A54), Ukrainian variation"]

1. d4 {This was, I think, the second game between me and dmaestro.  He won the first, which arose from a debate about an annotated game.  As is my custom, I bow to his higher grade by opening with 1. d4.} Nf6 {and he responds with my own favourite ...} 2. c4 d6 {but this is different.  A flexible move that could lead to any number of continuations.} 3. Nc3 e5 {The Old Indian.  As its name suggests, hardly the height of fashion but a sound opening with counter-attacking possibilities.} 4. e4 Nbd7 5. Nf3 Be7 6. Be2 c6 7. O-O O-O 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Rd1 {So far, all perfectly logical, and we're still in the database.  This move is by no means obvious but it's probably preferable to any other moves available at the time.  The main purpose is to contest the d-file, supporting d4 and establishing a longer term threat against Black's Q...} Qc7 {so Black sidesteps immediately with a natural developing move.} 10. d5 {gaining space at the expense of releasing some tension} Bf8 {Black avoids opening the c-file, apparently planning to adopt a conventional King's Indian formation.} 11. h3 {Preparing White's next move by preventing ... Ng4} g6 12. Be3 Nh5 {preparing ... Nf4 and ... f5} 13. g3 {discouraging ... Nf4} Nc5 {revealing an attack on the weakened h-pawn} 14. Kh2 Ng7 {unexpected but logical, as it further supports ... f5 and the N was no longer usefully employed on h5} 15. b4 {A typical thrust by White in Indian-style positions, dislodging Black's most forward piece} Nd7 16. Bg5 {A sign that I'm running out of ideas at this point.  This B doesn't attack anythingbut does take temporary control fo d8, where I suspected that Black would want to place his R or Q in due course.} f6 {Ntuarally Black pushes the intruder away.} 17. Bd2 {Retreating my B a further square to d2 as I intend reposting my R on e1 and I don't want it to be obstructing the defence of e4.  I'm conscious at this stage of the game of trying not to give Black any opportunities.} Nb6 {Freeing up the Bc8, though its only square is d7, so it's not much freedom.  This will, in turn connect Black's Rooks, though, so it's still worthwhile.  The N also builds prssure on d5 and c4, though it doesn't actually threaten either pawn as yet.} 18. a4 {Expanding on the Q-side and threatening to shift the N} cxd5 {Finally, Black "cracks" and releases the tension in the centre.  This exchange is well timed as White has to be careful about potential pins on the c-file and also about releasing Black's e-pawn, which could disrupt White's position if it advanced.} 19. Nxd5 Nxd5 {Black exploits the pin on the c-file to open up possibilities for his e-pawn} 20. exd5 f5 {Now Black's position is looking imposing but his Q-side is still undeveloped.} 21. Rac1 {Seeking to advance the c-pawn and attack Black's Q} Bd7 {Not only connecting his Rooks but tying White's Q to defence of his a-pawn.  The game seems delicately poised at this juncture, White attacking on the Q-side, Black on the K-side.} 22. a5 {Avoiding the attentions of the B and gaining more space.} Rac8 {Contesting the c-file and completing Black's development.} 23. Be3 {My Rook never made it to the e-file and my pawn has now left that file anyway, so there's no real reason for the B to stay off e3.  From here it threatens a7, which I should only take after full consideration of the risks.} b5 {Disrupting White's expansion on the Q-side.  24. cxb5 is out of the question because of 24... Qxc2 25. Rxc2 Rxc2.  24. c5 is also a possibility but probably helps Black more than White as it clears more space after 24... dxc5 and potentially several more exchanges.  There's one other response though ...} 24. axb6 e.p. axb6 {but now I couldn't see any constructive continuation.  Several times over the next two days I revisited this position and then skipped it to play easier games...} 25. Rd2 {finally finding this non-committal move that protects my Q in the event of the need to move my c-pawn off the c-file and prepares doubling rooks on either c-file or d-file as required.  the downside is that i deprives my N and B of this square should they be attacked.} Be7 {Black plays a similarly non-committal move, increasing the scope of the B} 26. Bg5 {so I decide to challenge it, which will improve my N's prospects} Bxg5 27. Nxg5 e4 {as the N has already left, this move no longer gains a tempo but the threat of ...e3 does.  There is a further point that I'd missed though ...} 28. Rd4 {anticipating ...e3 and reinforcing c4.  Black squares are relatively safe now.} h6 {! The N has nowhere to go.  White's best option is just to drop a pawn with 29. Ne6} 29. Ne6 Nxe6 30. dxe6 Bxe6 31. Qd2 {! double attack on d6 and h6} Red8 32. Qxh6 Qf7 {defends g6 and maintains the pressure on c4, without allowing the exchange of Qs} 33. Qf4 {recognising that there's no future in trying a mating attack yet and attacking d6} b5 {threatening to take on c4} 34. Rxd6 {ignoring that threat in pursuit of my own plans} Rxd6 35. Qxd6 Bxc4 36. Bxc4 Rxc4 37. Rxc4 bxc4 38. b5 {Now it's a pawn race but White's queening square is protected by his Q, whereas Black's is not.  Furthermore, White's Q controls the centre and threatens Black's exposed K, whereas White's K is protected by a ring of pawns} Kg7 {and Black resigned.  This took me completely by surprise but on further consideration I thought it quite justified for the general reasons outlined in the previous note, though I haven't bothered calculating an exact winning sequence or "mate in n moves" number.}
