[Opening "English (A22), Bremen, Smyslov system"]

1. c4 {White played English opening. It is one of the most popular openings. Making room for his Q and controlling the important W sq d5.} e5 {Black puts a pawn in the center. Controls 2 dark sqs d4 and f4 and opens diagonals for Q and B.} 2. Nc3 {Nice developing move, attacking central white squares. One of the good things about English opening is that c pawn is not locked by the N.} Nf6 {Development of K side.} 3. g3 {g3 so white can place B on g2 to put more pressure on white squares. } Bb4 {Clearing the way for castling and putting some pressure on white queen side.} 4. Bg2 {Fianchetto.} Nc6 {Another development, but bad thing N has blocked the c pawn. 0-0 is better. Then d6 and later Nbd7.} 5. e4 {Gaining space and occupying the important white square. Long diagonal is blocked.} d6 {Making way for QB.} 6. d3 {Nge2 is alternative.} O-O {Important move.} 7. Nge2 {Supporting QN. Nf3 blocks the f pawn.} a5 {Perhaps a mistake. ... a6 seems better.} 8. O-O Bc5 {Pinning f pawn and further controlling d4 sq.} 9. Bg5 {Developing and pinning. White's plan is to play Nd5 then capturing on f6, breaking the king side.} h6 {Putting question to the B. Blk wanted to resolve the pressure on his castled position.} 10. Be3 {White did'nt give up his important B for the N. if BxN QxB   Nd5 Qd8 i think blk pos is fine.} Bxe3 {So white have some weakness.} 11. fxe3 {Doubled pawns.} Ng4 {Attacking weak point.} 12. Qd2 {Defence. Q is unguarded. Perhaps Qc1 was better.} Qg5 {Another attack.} 13. Rf3 {Defence. Also planning to double the Rs by Raf1.} Nd4 {Attacking the R.} 14. exd4 {Blunder. NxN was the correct move.} Qxd2 {Winning the Q. Black is 6 points ahead in material. White resigned. In this game I controlled and occupied many dark squares. Thanks for watching the game. Please leave suggestions and comments. Regards.}
