1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Somehow, I, Jo Stevens yet again managed to get struck down by passivitis in the middlegame.  Did this result in me having to wave the white flag with Henry faced with certain Armageddon from the newly crowned white queen or will a reappearance of Glenda bring about the final twist in the endgame?  You will have to read on and see!  Kind regards - Joanne} e5 2. Bc4 {2. Bc4 - Bishop's Opening.} Nf6 {2. ……. Nf6 - hitting at e4.} 3. Qf3 {3. Qf3 - transposing into a Napoleon Opening.  Here  I have to watch out for Scholar's Mate, particularly if white plays g4 on the next turn.} Bc5 {3. …….. Bc5 - development.} 4. Ne2 Nc6 5. O-O Nb4 6. Bb3 a5 {6. ….. a5 - looking to trap the bishop on b3.} 7. a3 Nc6 8. c3 O-O {8. …..0-0 time to castle kingside.  I must be very wary of white's light square  bishop bearing down on f7.} 9. Bd5 Nxd5 10. exd5 Ne7 {10. …… Ne7 - glad to see the back of that  bishop!} 11. d4 exd4 12. c4 d6 {12. …… d6 - so white sacs a pawn eh?  What is he up to?} 13. Nd2 Ba7 14. Nb3 c5 15. Bd2 {15. Bd2 - white concentrates on development rather than breaking up my pawns by dxc6 ep.} b6 16. a4 Ng6 17. Bf4 Nxf4 18. Qxf4 {18. Qxf4 - so I have the  bishop pair against two knights.  Unfortunately, Fou Lenoir is a bit out of the game on a7 and he will stay there for many moves to come.} Bb7 19. Ng3 Qd7 {19. ….. Qd7 - clearing the decks.} 20. Rae1 Rae8 21. Rxe8 Rxe8 {21. ….. Rxe8 - rook trade.} 22. Ne4 Bb8 23. Nbd2 f5 24. Ng5 Bc8 25. Ndf3 {25. Ndf3 - out of nowhere white launches a kingside mating attack!} Qxa4 26. Qh4 h6 27. Qh5 {27. Qh5! Threatening Qg6 - nasty, nasty!} hxg5 {27. ….. hxg5 - on careful analysis I must accept the sacrifice immediately.  One of the considerations is the possibility of either my rook or Glenda delivering mate on white's back row.} 28. Nxg5 Bd7 {28. ….. Bd7 - this move looked good at the time but in fact GA gave it ??  It certainly looked as though I would be faced with Qf7+ on the next turn with the words "draw offer - perpetual check" but white had other ideas.} 29. Qh7+ Kf8 30. Qh8+ Ke7 {30 …… Ke7 - Run Henry, Run!} 31. Qxg7+ Kd8 32. Ne6+ Bxe6 33. Qf6+ Kc8 34. dxe6 Qxc4 {34. ….. Qxc4 - suddenly there is only one lonely white pawn on the queenside.  On the kingside, however, there is a different story.  There is 4 potentially lethal white pawns!  Eeek and double eeek!} 35. Re1 Qb5 36. Qxf5 {36. Qxf5 - threatening e7+.} Re7 37. Qf8+ Qe8 38. Qxe8+ Rxe8 39. f4 {39. f4 - despite the queen trade I will still have to watch those kingside pawns.  However, I now have an extra piece in Fou Lenoir.  At the moment he is still out of play but never fear, I have now found a use for him.  Over the next few moves you will see just what use I will be putting him to.} Bc7 40. f5 Bd8 {40. ……. Bd8 - now you will see that Operation Joblock is about to strike again.  Those white pawns will be blockaded by Fou Lenoir.  Normally I use Operation Joblock to grind out a draw against the Experts but here I will use it to try and promote my own black pawns without interference from the other side.} 41. g3 d3 {41. ….. d3 - pawn push!} 42. h4 Bf6 43. b3 d5 44. Kg2 c4 45. bxc4 dxc4 {45. …. dxc4 - pawn trade.  Now I have 4 passers on the queenside - wow!} 46. Kf3 d2 47. Rd1 c3 48. Ke2 c2 {48 …… c2! White will have to give up his rook to stop Glenda from making a re-appearance.} 49. Rxd2 c1=Q 50. Rd7 {50. Rd7 - so, he keeps his rook on but, there is Glenda and she will now show you just what she can do on an open board!} Qc2+ {50. ….. Qc2+ - queen fork no.1.} 51. Ke3 Qxf5 {51. ….. Qxf5 - the clean up begins!} 52. Rf7 Qxe6+ {52. …… Qxe6+ Queen fork no.2 - with his rook about to go on the next turn white waves the white flag.  So, I win the game but by god isn't Jo a lucky so and so - would you all agree?}
