1. e4 {With idldice81's permission I'm annotating this game for the benefit of our team, the Burninators.  } e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {This opening is known as Petrov's Defence (C42).} 3. Nxe5 {And now the French attack variant.} d6 {The standard continuation is unfolding...} 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 {This is now the classical attack variant, all moves according to book.} d5 {This move is designed to stake a claim to the center and post my knight to be a constant thorn in white's side.  An early priority should be to dislodge my knight or attack the d5 pawn, all while developing your own pieces.} 6. Bd3 {Book response.} Bd6 {Book, and for those chess monkeys, it's called the Marshall variation.} 7. O-O {Castling is a good idea here as it frees up the rook to play as well.} c6 {This move was designed to give my knight and the d5 pawn some staying power.  I anticipated that his c pawn of remaining knight will come into play soon.} 8. c4 {And there it is.  This is a great move as it puts pressure on my d pawn but also allows his knight to develop as well, to bring on the heat.  There are a lot of good possibilities here for white.} O-O {Time to castle in case I need to bring my rook into the game.} 9. cxd5 {This is one of the most typical responses at this point and white is attacking just like he should.} cxd5 {No other response worth considering.} 10. Nc3 {Continuing an aggressive attack, white is in good shape.  I have a few options here.} Bg4 {This was perhaps not my strongest play, but I wanted to put some pressure on white's knight and see what shook loose.  I also didn't want to give white the chance to shift another pawn to his center, giving him a stronger center advantage.  My d pawn is weak and isolated, but if it is, I'd rather his was too.  If white takes Nxd5, Bxh2+ regains parity.} 11. Nxe4 {Effectively earning a pawn advantage.} dxe4 {No other choice.} 12. Bxe4 {And now white is ahead a pawn.  I have only a few responses that can save me from real damage on my queenside rook.} Nc6 {I prefer this move to Qc7 as it continues development, but also puts some added pressure on his d pawn, and maybe something good can happen.  So far white is playing superb.} 13. Bxc6 {I believe that this exchange is a bit premature, as you need to have pieces in order to mount an effective attack, however, it does break up my queenside pawns and they are now isolated, so in and of itself, that's not a bad thing.  Pawns are more valuable when they are connected, and isolated they are weak.} bxc6 14. Qd3 {This move is great, but it is potentially dangerous if you don't follow through, as I will show in a few moves.  White wants to relieve pressure on his knight and allow his queen to move freely.  This is good, but if you want to take that step, follow through and either protect your newly moved pieces and/or move your knight on to the g5 square for an attack on black's king.  Dangling pieces (protected by only air) can lead to very bad things if you're not careful.  Where possible it is always better to move pieces to a place where they are protected and/or have some support from a secondary piece.  A better move sequence, instead of 13 Bxc6 would have been 13. Qd3, forcing me to 13... h6.} c5 {Here is a little gambit ploy I try, to see if I can coax white into a big mistake, but he doesn't bite.  Moves like this in blitz chess can be damning if you fall into the trap.  A better move here is to take a rook to an open file (thanks kingcruel).} 15. h3 {This move appears natural and one that will make me either trade pieces with his knight or shoo away.  I chose the latter.  A better approach here is to target my king with something like Ng5.} Be6 16. d5 {This move is actually a good one that I didn't appreciate that much in game.  I thought that white was giving away his pawn for free, as his queen cannot take or risk capture, but doubling up my bishops with his potential for a rook/queen combo able to come online and it can be dangerous for me.} Bxd5 17. Be3 {I was holding my breath, hoping that he would take with 17 Qxd5.  He didn't make that move, but this one is not so good either.  It does connect his rooks, which is always a plus in development, but it doesn't add much attack value with where he placed it.   More damning, however, it will also cost him his knight for free.  If he re-takes, very bad things happen.  The better move here for white would have been to put the knight on g5 followed up by Rd1, breaking my chance to exchange with the knight and earning a bishop for the pawn I took on d5. (thanks kingcruel)} Bxf3 18. gxf3 {And very bad things are about to happen.  Here is the biggest learning point of the annotation.  If you go all the way back to move 14, I said that you don't leave pieces supported only by air.  If you do they can become a liability.  Here, after retaking with his g pawn, because his queen isn't supported, it will now be exchanged for a bishop.  You have to be cognizant of a bishop's potential check, because it can hurt if you aren't paying attention.} Bh2+ {19. Kxh2 Qxd3 and white is down 6 points (5 after 20. Bxc5), but not a place you want to be with a questionable pawn structure.  In a game against equal players, most resign here, and white chose the path of least resistance.}
