1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Bf4 {A peculiar looking move. Some players tend to go overboard when their opponent plays something out of the ordinary, trying to refute moves that they think are not in accordance to the position, to the point of ruining their own position on the process. I have to confess I am guilty of this sin and have lost many a game by over-pushing and trying to castigate strange moves. } Bg7 {Simple development, White isn't planning anything concrete with his last move, so there is no point to seek adventure in lines like 3...c5 4. d5 Qb6 5. Nc3 Qxb2 6. Be5 d6 7. Rb1 Qa3 8. Nb5 Qa5+ 9. Bc3 Qd8, after which Black's position might seem preferable but it offers White some compensation and justifies the development of the Bishop to f4.} 4. e3 {White postpones again the development of his Knights and plays another strange move. Like I said before, experience has taught me that it's better not to over-react and play in accordance to your plans not your opponents.} d5 {Taking control of e4 and indirectly exploiting White's last two moves. The Bishop on f4 doesn't approve of capturing on d5 and if White will ever manage to push the pawn to e4, he would have lost an important tempo.} 5. Nc3 {After this move, the position has transposed to the Bf4 lines in the Gruenfeld. My opponent seemed like a fish out of the water in what followed.} c5 {Hitting the center without delay, the most active replay. The pawn sacrifice starting with 5...0-0 is playable but I like hitting the center as early as possible.} 6. Nf3 {Most of White's forcing lines start with 6. dxc5, where many attempts have been made to punish Black for playing so impetuously.} cxd4 {Releasing the center and a psychological bet. Taking with the Knight is objectively better, since White gets some activity but Black won't have much trouble in repulsing the early initiative. However, I was more than sure that my opponent will recapture with the pawn.} 7. exd4 {A dream position for any Gruenfeld player. White's d-pawn is a very real target in many lines, where it is much better defended. I think the position will soon transpose, as White will waste a few tempos, to the Tarrasch defense.} O-O {White's position seems very active but Black as adequate resources and is looking confidently to the endgame.} 8. Be2 {The first waste of a tempo. In what follows, it's pretty hard to find a single move which is wrong by White, what is revealed by his moves, though, is the lack of a plan of action. It takes a very active player to hold the balance in a position with an IQP (isolated Queen's pawn).} dxc4 {Releasing the final tension in the center. I am now ready to lay siege to the IQP.} 9. Bxc4 Bg4 {Making White lose another tempo, since sooner or later he will be forced to retreat the Bishop to e2, thus having lost two moves. The d-pawn is also under direct attack.} 10. Be3 {White is starting to defend and pull back his actively placed Bishops.} Nc6 {Developing with tempo. 11. d5 leads to nothing good after either 11...Bxf3 or 11...Ne5.} 11. Be2 {So White is now three tempos down. A simple count of tempos reveals that I am technically playing the White side of the Tarrasch. } Nd5 {Setting up the blockade on d5. White has a very good score in this line of the Tarrasch.} 12. O-O Qd7 {The theoretical move was 12...Rc8. I wanted to begin mounting pressure on White's d-pawn instead.} 13. h3 {Prompting me to exchange my Bishop, which would ease White's position.} Be6 {Slightly better than 13...Bf5, because I have no desire to push the e-pawn right now and from here the Bishop controls the very important square d5.} 14. Qd3 {A bad place to develop the Queen. It will be very exposed to attacks by the minor pieces. 14. Qd2 would have been better.} Rac8 {Since there are only two open columns, it's pretty easy to decide which Rook goes where. } 15. Rfd1 Rfd8 16. Rac1 {Both sides have developed all their pieces. But there is a hidden weakness in White's position, which becomes very evident in a few moves.} Ncb4 {With the Queen on d2, this move wouldn't have been so strong. The a2 pawn now is tactically attacked.} 17. Qd2 {Trying to defend a2 with the Queen can lead to disaster after 17...Bf5! 18. Bb5 (18. Qa1 loses the exchange after 18...Nc2) Qe6 19. Ng5 Qxe3! 20. fxe3 Bxb1 21. Nxd5 Nxd5 22. Rxc8 Rxc8 23. Rxb1 Nxe3 and not only has White lost a pawn, he's still stuck with a IQP, which is significantly weaker with fewer pieces on the board.} Nxe3 {This strengthens White's d-pawn but it was necessary in order to clear the diagonal of the Bishop with tempo.} 18. fxe3 {18. Qxe3 was better since it would have posed Black the question if he can really capture on a2. Here is a forced line that gives rise to an interesting endgame 18...Nxa2 19. Nxa2 Bxa2 20. b3 (trying to trap the Bishop) Rxc1 21. Rxc1 Bxd4 ( 21...Rc8 might offer more winning chances) 22. Nxd4 Qxd4 23. Qxe7 Bxb3 24. Rb1 Be6 25. Rd1 Qxd1+ 26. Bxd1 Rxd1+ 27. Kh2 Rd7 28. Qe8+ Kg7 29. Qb8! b6 which Black should win had not been for the weak dark squares around his King since White can force a perpetual.} Nxa2 {A tasty morsel. I just realized that in two of my current games I have captured this exact pawn to gain material, albeit not always positional, advantage.} 19. Rca1 {A mistake. 19. Nxa2 Bxa2 20. Rxc8 Qxc8 21. Ra1 Bd5 22. Rxa7 would have kept the material balance, but I still have good winning chances owing to the Bishop pair and White's fragile castled position.} Nxc3 20. bxc3 a6 {The pawn is saved and now it's time to convert the extra material.} 21. Rac1 {Preparing to push c4 and create a strong center that would ensure some counterplay.} Bc4 {21...b5 might be objectively better, but I was looking for opportunities to exchange pieces.} 22. Bxc4 Rxc4 23. Qd3 {White will conquer c4 eventually but I have time to double my Rooks and prepare for the march of the a-pawn.} b5 {Making sure White won't have the chance to create a passed pawn on the c-file.} 24. Nd2 {Kicking away my Rook but I was prepared for this.} Rc7 25. c4 bxc4 26. Nxc4 {White avoids exchanges in order to make my life hard.} Qb5 {Pinning the Knight in two ways.} 27. Rd2 {27. Rc2 was more accurate in order to double on the c-file.} Rdc8 {I could have used the pin on the d-file to play more actively with 27...e5 but I was more concerned with exchanges. After 28. d5 Bf8!, the Bishop is very active and White has trouble coordinating his pieces and defending the d5-pawn.} 28. Rdc2 {White doubles in return. The position has settled.} a5 {So I can start pushing my extra pawn. It's not going to queen in four moves, but the threat alone is enough to make my opponent jumpy...} 29. Rb2 {...and reply with this. Under different circumstance, such a trade could benefit White, for example if he had enough time to attack my castled position. But here it just hastens his defeat.} Qxb2 {Not forced, 29...Qc6 was possible, but exchanging pieces and increasing my advantage is an offer I can't refuse.} 30. Nxb2 Rc7xc1+ 31. Kh2 {Notice the position of the Nb2 and Kh2? It's not hard to guess my next move.} e5 {Activating the Bishop with tempo and making sure the a-pawn will Queen.} 32. d5 {32. Na4 was safer but still losing in the long run.} e4 {A very impertinent pawn, hitting the Queen with impunity.} 33. Qa3 {White decides to save the Knight and attack my a-pawn.} Be5+ {But now he gets mated.} 34. g3 Rc8c2# {A pretty mate, White's Queen and Knight are punished on the edge of the Board while the King is left at the mercy of the Rooks and Bishop.}
