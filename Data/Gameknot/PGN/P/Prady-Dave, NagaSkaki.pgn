[Opening "QGD Slav (D11), 3.Nf3"]

1. d4 {Trying out the QP opening as decided.} d5 {Oh, what luck! Can try the Queen's gambit. } 2. c4 c6 {All I know is this is called the Slav defense. } 3. Nf3 {Developing the KN, preventing ...e5.} dxc4 {Thinking in terms of general opening principles, I did not understand why Black did this. I rather thought it favored me.} 4. Nc3 {Developing the QN, preparing for e4.} Nf6 {Attacking e4.} 5. e4 {Controlling the center, opening path for the KB, not blocking the QB, attacking the pawn on c4.} b5 {It was not hard to understand the intentions of this pawn move. It was so close to threatening my QN and weakening my central pawn. } 6. Qc2 {When the N moves, the Q would support the pawn on e4. The only square from where the Q could do so without blocking other pieces was c2. } Bg4 {Now Black attacks my KN, trying to weaken my central pawn. My very first thought was to add support to d4 with Be3. But after ...Bxf3 gxf3, it would destroy my chances of castling King-side. No, I must find another way to a) facilitate safe castling b) recapture on f3 d) develop another piece, if possible and d) quickly add support to the pawn on d4. Then it struck me... } 7. Be2 Bxf3 8. Bxf3 {a) I'm ready to castle b) I have the bishop pair c) Black's QN is not yet active d) It will take another pawn move to unblock  Black's KB e) Black needs at least two more moves to be able to castle... Although I'm down a physical pawn, I think I'm slightly better off. } b4 {This was expected.} 9. Ne2 {It feels so good to be prepared.} e5 10. Be3 {Defending d4, developing the B, clearing the back rank for connected rooks.} c3 11. bxc3 {Why not?} Bd6 {Now you want to castle?} 12. O-O {Me, first!} O-O 13. Rfd1 {Just saw some kind of tactical possibility since Black's B and Q were in line.} Qc7 14. Ng3 {Covering h2.} bxc3 15. Qxc3 {Why not?} exd4 16. Bxd4 {The surprising symmetry did not last for long.} Bxg3 17. hxg3 Ne8 {Oh, what fun...} 18. Bc5 Nd7 19. Bxf8 Kxf8 20. Rab1 {Just following principle.} Rc8 21. Qa3+ Kg8 22. Bg4 Rd8 23. f4 Ndf6 24. Bf3 a5 25. Rdc1 Nd6 {Oh, what fun...} 26. e5 Nde4 27. exf6 Qa7+ 28. Kh2 Nxf6 29. Rxc6 Qd4 {But why?} 30. Rd1 Qxd1 31. Bxd1 {If Black takes, it's mate in 3.} Ra8 32. Qb3 Ne8 33. Bf3 Ra7 34. Bd5 Re7 35. Rc8 a4 36. Qb4 Re2 37. Bc6 Rxg2+ {Oh, man!} 38. Kxg2 h5 39. Be4 {Blocking the escape route.} f5 {What the...!} 40. Bxf5 Kf7 41. Qb5 {I guess there was a shorter path, but my clock was running out.} Nd6 42. Qd7+ Kf6 43. Qe6# {}
