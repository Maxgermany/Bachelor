[Opening "English (A30), symmetrical, hedgehog system"]

1. c4 {English opening.} c5 {Symmetrical. What uncomfortable players play. So do I...} 2. Nf3 {Referred to as hedgehog system.} d6 3. d4 b6 {This is off the main line. We classically see 3. d4 cxd4. My opponent maybe tries to open ways for the c Bishop aiming at my c pawn. But watch out! The diagonal is open to the a Rook as well. Keep this in mind.} 4. Nc3 {Simply developing without any weird idea, I promise.} e6 {Opening ways for the Queen now?} 5. e3 {Putting pressure on d4 while preparing for castling.} Nf6 {Preparing for castling too, but no pressure of any kind.} 6. Bd3 {A gentle move? Not exactly. The Bishop is already in position to aim at the King side.} Be7 {Still trying to castle King-side.} 7. O-O {This was in the air.} O-O {So was this.} 8. e4 {Pushing pawn because it's time for the battle.} Nbd7 {This was a bit puzzling, I confess. Probably 8. ... Nc6 would have been a better move, putting pressure on the center.} 9. e5 {Still pushing pawn and going to exchange.} dxe5 10. dxe5 {Now I have advantage in the center. Please note there's no advantage in pieces.} Ng4 {Trying to escape to the front line. A classical response would be ... h3. But this was not in my mind.} 11. Qe2 {I move my Queen because I want to take control of the e column. Of course Qe4 is now so tempting for the next move...} f6 {A poor move. I figure out my opponent was avoiding a move of my f Knight.} 12. Qe4 {Turning on the fast forward now. Remember the freed diagonal after 3. â€¦ b6? Payback time! At this point, what do you see at first? I'd say, there's the evidence: a fork on Rook and Knight. What can he do? Moving the Rook - the Knight is dead. Moving the Knight - the Rook is dead. As you will see, he will choose to make some mess in my defence with his Knight while losing his Rook, and win a tempo to move his Knight back. But... there's something else. My Queen and d Knight are now aligned. This means that I will no longer consider taking pieces and preferably will rely on my position advantage.} Nxh2 {Making some mess and waiting for his Rook to die.} 13. Qxh7+ {Fatal attack in 2 moves.} Kf7 14. Bg6# {The purpose of this annotation was to set forward the most important role of a good position, letting pieces for what they are: consolation.}
