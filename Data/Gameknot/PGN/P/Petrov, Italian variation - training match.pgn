[Opening "Petrov (C42), Italian variation"]

1. e4 {This game is a training match against a teammate.  Welcome any and all comments.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petrov defense, one of my favorite lines.} 3. Bc4 {Good opening position for White... a lot of attack power, clearing way for a castle, and the potential for a lot of pressure on Black without good counterplay.} Nxe4 {Another option (and more common) is Nc6, but in training matches I like to get aggressive early to test people's mettle.} 4. Nc3 {Personally I like Nxe5 or Qe2 more, but this line is playable.  Another good option is castling.} Nc6 {Developing the second knight and offering some defense for e5} 5. d3 {Not the top response.  I strongly prefer 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Bxd5 Qxd5 7. Nc3.  Another option worth considering is 5. Bxf7+ Kxf7 6. Nxe4 d5 7. Neg5+ } Nf6 {I also considered Nxc3} 6. Bg5 {Another strong consideration should have been 0-0, allowing the rook to get into the game.} Be7 {Preparing for the castle.} 7. Qe2 {Unless White is considering 0-0-0, I would go ahead and castle 0-0 and then think about attacking.} d6 {Defending e5 and opening a path for the LSB.} 8. h3 {0-0 is a better play} O-O 9. O-O {And now White's development is complete.  Although down a pawn, still in fairly good position overall.} Be6 {Completing the development of Black.  A common perception is that doubling pawns is bad.  However, doubled pawns in the center with supporting side pawns can provide some attack options and opening a file for a rook is never a bad thing, IF White takes.} 10. Bxe6 {And he takes.  I'm not immediately opposed to this play, but White should also consider b3 or b5, if just to prevent me from getting an open file for my rooks to getting greater reach.} fxe6 11. Ne4 Nxe4 12. Bxe7 {Order of capture is important.  If Black had taken Ne4 first, Black gains a piece.} Qxe7 {An unfortunate side effect for White is that my rooks are now connected and I get a free positional development for my queen.  It's not a big advantage, but little advantages add up over time.} 13. Qxe4 {In general I like taking with the queen more than the d pawn, to get a more centralized location from which to assault the board and keep some attack options on the e5 pawn.  However, I can harass White and gain some tempo by moving my rook, all because White let me get a half-open file on turn 10.  Because of the free tempo move I probably would have taken dxe4.} Rf4 {Allowing me to move White's queen and also giving tempo to connect my rooks in a battery on the half-open f-file.} 14. Qe2 Raf8 {Note that White can't easily dislodge my rook on f4, as g3 loses the knight.  If White can't force me to move my rook, it's a strong projection of power into his half of the board.  White's priority should be leveraging his knight to dislodge my rook.  That is complicated because of the position of White's queen.} 15. Rae1 {I might have moved Nd2 or c3.  Another strong move to consider is Rad1.  When in doubt put your two rooks on the d and e files.  Generally speaking if you are going to pen in a piece, like a rook, it should be temporary or if you are going to pawn push behind the rook.} Qf6 {threatening the b2 pawn with e4.} 16. c3 {easily seen by White, but is that Black's only ploy?} Qg6 {Setting up the pawn pin, forcing White to move his knight and beginning to lay the foundation for a central pawn push.  Any moves that can accomplish more than one thing at a time are must do's.} 17. a3 {Mistake!  White failed to see the threat of the pin.} Rf4xf3 18. Kh2 {Relieving the pin.} Rf3f5 {Rxd3 would have momentarily netted a pawn, but f3 might have made the rook difficult to extract and was not seen as worth the risk.} 19. Qe3 {centralizing is always a good thing.} Qg5 {Offering the queen trade.} 20. Qxg5 {Accepted.  When you're down more than a piece, trade pawns, not pieces.  The queen trade is ill advised unless forced.} Rxg5 21. f3 {A good positional play to restrict Black's options.  Being down a pawn and a piece late is not the end of the world.  If we trade down to just a piece advantage (assuming White can retake the pawn), that can net a draw.} Rgf5 {reconnecting the rooks.} 22. Re4 {Looking to project his own power via rook battery.} Rf5f4 23. Rxf4 {Where possible, trade pawns, not pieces when you're down.} exf4 {I thought a lot about which piece to use to retake and ultimately decided to undouble my pawns and use it as an excuse to get my rook to the middle.} 24. Re1 {Rooks love open (or half-open) files.} Rf6 25. g3 {I almost traded pawns reflexively, but after some more thought, I saw the opportunity to net a free pawn.  The intent behind the move is good, to remove the threat of the f pawn, but d4 is needed first.  Also, breaking up the connected pawns on the kingside is not  worth it yet.} Ne5 {no matter what White does, they lose a pawn, and black threatens a King/rook fork.} 26. Kg2 Nxd3 27. Re2 {Forced rook move.  If not for that, g4 would have been nice.  Rf1 might have been better, but with this move the half-open file is maintained.} fxg3 28. Kxg3 Rg6+ {Seriously restricting White's position.} 29. Kh2 Nf4 30. Re4 e5 {Now Black has a dangerous post for a knight to complement the rook.} 31. b4 {Protecting against Rg2+} Rh6 {No matter what White does, except Rxf4, White loses the h pawn.} 32. Kg3 {Possibly eyeing Rxf4 to net a knight and a pawn for free, significantly rebalancing the board.} Rxh3+ 33. Kg4 {Trying to keep the promise of Rxf4 on the table.  That said, I think Kf2 is a better play.} h5+ {Keeping the pressure on.  I looked hard at Rh2 to try and mate White's king, but if White moves the rook, there is an escape route.  As a result charge forward.} 34. Kf5 Rxf3 {Allowing a discovered check} 35. Rc4 {Looking to keep fighting and hopefully scarf some pawns.  However, it turns out not to be very helpful.} Ne2+ 36. Ke4 {Blunder!  Kg5 or Ke6 are both much better.  This move locks in White's rook and eliminates his final power piece.} Rxc3 37. Rxc3 Nxc3+ 38. Kf5 e4 {The pawn march that will ultimately doom White.  With proper play White cannot stop both.} 39. Kf4 h4 40. Kg4 e3 {And that, as they say, is that.} 41. Kxh4 e2 {Giving up the pawn early wasn't the end of the world, but missing the pin on move 17 proved to be too costly for White to overcome.  When you're down, try to trade up or, if forced, trade pawns, not pieces.  You need your pieces to make plays as pawns normally don't have the punching power.  A few mistakes by White later on opened more holes for Black to punch through.  Thank you for reading!}
