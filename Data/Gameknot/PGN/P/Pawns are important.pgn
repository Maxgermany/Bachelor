[Opening "King's Indian defence, 3.Nc3 (E61)"]

1. d4 {This was first time my opponent played 1.d4 against me instead of 1.c4 that he uses often.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. e4 O-O {I was quite confident right now as I had won 6 games and drawed 3 times from my last 10 games with kings indian.} 6. a3 {I see that my opponent had little surprise for me in this game. I was already prepared to continue with 6.Be2 but I wasnt worried about this move even that with this move white tries to put pressure on queenside later in this game.} e5 {I keep responding normally as normal moves are safe moves.} 7. d5 Qe7 {Now this move has been played more rarely but it is used even that position isint same as normally with move Qe7. If we dont look at the move 6.a3 but instead 6.Be2 e5 7.e3 Qe7 then we see in which position this move is normally performed.} 8. Be2 Na6 {In here 8.a5 0-0 is probably even better as a5 tries to fight back against white possible queenside pawn storm but by moving 8...Na6 im looking for possibility to play knight on c7.} 9. b4 {White starts his pawn pushing on early stage.} c5 {Now I was just trying to stop my opponent pawn pushing on queenside and looking for knight to be placed on c7.} 10. b5 {So know I am just forced to move Nc7. I was expecting 10.dxc6 bxc6 11.0-0 Bb7 but I think that 10.b5 and 10.dxc6 are about equal.} Nc7 {These kind of slow positions are what I favour more than those energic attacking positions.} 11. O-O Ng4 {Now I am just looking for to play knight on h6 and pawn to f5.} 12. h3 Nh6 {12...Nf6 Re2 would lose the meaning of 11...Ng4.} 13. a4 {White keeps pushing on.} f5 {This is normal move on Kings indian, I trying to open position little bit.} 14. Bg5 {Good move. This is also quite normal in Kings indian to move bishop this way and there also escaping route to h2 now. 14.Bxh6 Bxh6 is quite useless as it wont give anything to white.} Qd7 15. a5 {White keeps pushing again.} Nf7 {This is natural after moving knight to h6 followed by pawn to f5.} 16. Bh4 {16.Bd2 Qe7 is what computer offered but black can move 16...Ne8 17.Bd3 Nf6 18.Qb3 f4 19.b6 a6 so that option isint any better than 16.Bh6.} h6 {I am just securing g5 square with this move.} 17. exf5 gxf5 {Only good capture of f5 pawn as 17...Qxf5? 18.Bd3 Qd719.Bxg6 fails.} 18. Nd2 e4 {Now I open my bishops way and push pawn on same time which is usually good option if it is available.} 19. Ra3 {Good move that secures 3th rank from my pawns and gets rook out of my bishops way.} Ne5 {Its always good to get knight on center of board as it is tricky one there.} 20. g4 {20.g4?! not the best option as 20.b6 Na6 21.bxa7 Rxa7 22.f3 exf3 23.Nxf3 is available. This move is bit inaccurate but It works if black takes the pawn by 20...fxg4 21.Bxg4 Nxg4 22.Qxg4 Qxg4  23.hxg4 Bxg4 24.Ncxe4. In this game I felt that this is not the best one but not bad one either.} Ng6 {This is the correct answer in here as 20...f4 21.Ncxe4 Ng6(not 21.Ndxe4 Ng6) 22.Nf3 Nxh4 23.Nxh4 isint so effective for black and 20...fxg4 21.Bxg4 Nxg4 22.Qxg4 Qxg4  23.hxg4 Bxg4 24.Ncxe4 is horrible.} 21. Bg3 f4 {This is the only effective response which tries to win material against whites powerful queenside pawn storm as 21...Bxc3 22.Rxc3 Qg7 23.gxf5 Qxc3 24.Nxe4 Qg7 25.fxg6 gives white big advantage because his pieces are more active and his queenside pawns are dangerous-} 22. Bh2 f3 {Bxc3 is still out of question and by this move I win material but white has really powerful queenside play with his pawns so I must be really careful.} 23. Ndxe4 {My opponent used about 15min on these move and after the game he offered 23.Bxf3 but he couldnt find any good way to with it. After analysing we came up with example how this game could have continued 23.Bxf3 exf3 24.Nxf3 Nf4 25.Bxf4 Rxf4 26.Qd3 Rxg4  27.hxg4 Qxg4  28.Kh1 Qh3  29.Kg1 Bf5 30.Qd1 Bxc3 31.Rxc3 Kh8 32.Nd4 Rg8  33.Rg3 Rxg3  34.fxg3 Qxg3  35.Kh1 Qh4  36.Kg1 cxd4 with really difficult position to play.} fxe2 24. Nxe2 {I myself favour this option by white more.} Ne5 {Now this move seemed to be dangerous as by 25.Bxe5 it opens my protection on queenside little bit and on this stage I had really passive pieces even that I was in material lead. I wasnt feeling comfortable at all because this was slow position where white just tries to push his pawns through my defense and I just could find any good kind of counterplay.} 25. Bxe5 {This was expected.} dxe5 26. Ne2g3 {This position is really passive for me and I need to play accurately and try to find a good way out. White will even get my c5 pawn and that seemed to be really dangerous.} Qf7 {My computer favoured 26...Ne8 more.} 27. Nxc5 Ne8 {I was sure that I need to sacrifice material to stop this pawn storm, it is amazing how dangerous whites pawns are and this is good example of effective pawn pushing on queenside in Kings indian.} 28. Nce4 {White opens his pawns way.} Nf6 {Now I offered a trade by thinking of playing queen to 6th rank which could be effective in stopping those pawns.} 29. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {White accepts the trade.} 30. c5 {Definetly the best move from view as white just keeps pushing and try to win somehing from queenside playing.} a6 {Something needs to be done for these pawns.} 31. Nh5 {I was looking just 31.d6 and trying to think what I do after it and that is why this move became as a surprise. This moved seemed to be even more effective at the time but in my after analysis I think this move to be equal with 31.d6.} Qf7 {I dont know why I moved queen out of 6th rank where I wanted it to be.} 32. b6 {White keeps pushing even more.} Bd7 {I need to protect c6 and try to get more help by opening a8 rook.} 33. Nxg7 Qxg7 34. Qc2 {Its good to get rook to join pawn pushing too.} Bb5 {Im not exactly sure but this move can be a mistake as by moving 35.Rb1 Rad8 36.Rxb5 axb5 37.c6 b4 38.Rb3 Rxd5 39.c7 Rxa5 40.c8Q white would win.} 35. Re1 Rad8 {There are better moves in here like 35...Rf6 and then game could follow by 36.Rg3 Raf8 37.Rg2(not 37.Rxe5 Rxf2 38.Qc3 Rf1  39.Kh2 R8f2  40.Rg2 Rf3 and position is great for black) or the game could continue by 35...Rf5 36.Rxe5 Raf8 37.Qc3 Rxf2.} 36. c6 {White goes for the direct option.} Rxd5 {Pawn must be taken. 36...Rd6 is good try but after 37.cxb7 Qxb7 38.Rxe5 Qg7 39.Re6 Rxe6 40.dxe6 Qf6 41.Re3 Bc6 42.Qe2 Bb7 43.e7 Re8 44.Re6 Qg7 45.Qd3 Kh8 46.f4 and black would have fallen to deep trouble. In this game I didnt calculate that far as after analysing that option few moves it just felt to be too dangerous and I left that idea.} 37. c7 {Now white has dangerous 7th rank pawn that is really well protected.} Bd7 {I need to put some kind of stop to this pawn.} 38. Rc3 Bc8 {And now the pawn isint going to become queen right away.} 39. Rc5 {My opponent had 1min in his clock right now and he was one move away from 40th move increasement and I had about 8min. My opponent had played really well even that he didnt have so much time to spend on his moves, it needs skill to use time in the most effective way and so that you wont make hestitated move because of time.} Rd4 {I didnt want to change our rooks by playing 39...Rxc5 40.Qxc5 41.f4 which I think to be more effective.} 40. Qb3+ {White had position where he can make this kind of move that you dont have to think much so it was easy for him to get increasement. Thinking of options like 40.Rexe5? or 40.Rcxe5?! arent so good as this option and by looking at my opponents time these kind of moves needs more time to think. 40.Rexe5? would continue by 40...Bxg4 41.Re7 Qxe7 42.Qg6  Qg7 43.Qxg7  Kxg7 44.hxg4 Rxg4  45.Kh2 Rc8 and option 40.Rcxe5?! Rxg4  41.hxg4 Qxg4  42.Kf1 Qh3  43.Kg1 Qg4  44.Kh2 Qh3  45.Kg1 Qg4  isint good as white is playing for win.} Kh8 41. Qe3 {White has played really well this far. I must admire him that he has been able to launch correct moves after another without slight mistakes. Options like 41.Rexe5 are not so effectise as by playing 41...Bxg4 42.Qg3 Bxh3 43.Qxg7  Kxg7 or 41.Rcxe5 Bxg4 42.Qg3 Bxh3 43.Qxg7  Kxg7 44.Re7  Kg8 position isint so good for white as it could be.} e4 {I need to try something even that this is quite useless.} 42. Rh5 {Again white goes for correct answer. It is beautiful to watch when player has found a roud to follow that leads to nice moves after another even that this position is unclear still white shows that he is fighting for win.} Kh7 {42.Kg8 wont work as 43.Rxh6 Rf3(not 43.Qxh6 Qxh6 Rxh6) 44.Rg6 Rxe3 45.Rxg7  Kxg7 46.Rxe3 and draw chance might come after 46...Rd2.} 43. Rxh6+ Qxh6 44. Qxd4 {White trusts that his queensides 7th rank pawn with other will help him as they do.} Qxh3 {The best option that tries still something even that this is quite useless right now.} 45. Rxe4 Qh4 46. Kg2 {Even at this stage white makes these calm moves even that he could try to go for more direct options.} Kg6 {46...Rh8 47.Qd6 Rg8 48.f3 is too dangerous.} 47. Qd6+ {White goes for winning move by trading queens.} Qf6 {47...Rf6 doesnt help anything as 48.Qg3 Qg5 49.Qd3 Bf5 50.Qd5} 48. Qxf6+ Kxf6 {My bishop has been just standing on c8 and that material advantage has been useless for me.} 49. f3 {White has strong queenside pawns and now he has even strong kingside pawns that are free to advance, nobody would want to be me right now.} Rg8 50. Kg3 Be6 {Im just moving as I had lost my intrest in this game already or I was living in somekind of fairy tale that white echanges his rook to my bishop and I go for draw.} 51. Kf4 Bc8 {nothing is happening from my part.} 52. Re5 Rh8 53. g5+ {white keeps going.} Kf7 54. Ke4 {king out of pawns way.} Rh1 55. f4 Re1+ 56. Kd5 Rd1+ {just checking....} 57. Kc5 Rc1+ 58. Kd6 Rd1+ 59. Rd5 {Now I cant even continue my fun by checking.} Rf1 60. f5 Rg1 61. f6 {Now its only matter of time when white will get his pawns through} Re1 62. Re5 Rd1+ {and I go back for my own fun.} 63. Kc5 Rc1+ 64. Kd4 Rd1+ 65. Kc3 {King is coming....} Rc1+ 66. Kd2 Rf1 67. Re7+ {Now I resigned and I have probably been irritating for my opponent as I kept moving so I felt it was right to say sorry that I kept continuing and so I did. It looks like I need to go back to learn basics as material doesnt win against mighty pawn arsenal. Somebody might wonder why I didnt try to go for draw by someway and truth is I didnt find one and other reason is that I hate draws as I want only to win but in lost position I will go for draw if I find it even that I hate it.}
