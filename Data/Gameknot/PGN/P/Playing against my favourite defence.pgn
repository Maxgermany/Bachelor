[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann is my favourite defense to the king-pawn opening.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {I chose the advance variation.} Bf5 4. Nf3 {Not 4. Bd3 Bxd3 5. Qxd3 Qb6! 6. Nf3 Qa6 and Black gets a good game. This plan for Black was Nimzovich's idea.} h6 5. Be2 {The Short variation, championed my English grandmaster Nigel Short.} e6 6. O-O Be7 7. c4 Bg5 {?! dubious, sacrificing the "minor exchange" - bishop for knight} 8. Nxg5 hxg5 9. cxd5 exd5 10. Qd2 f6 {Black is behind in development.} 11. exf6 gxf6 12. Qe3+ Kf7 {The black king is safe on f7 for the moment.} 13. Nc3 Qd6 {threatening mate on h2} 14. Qg3 Qxg3 15. fxg3 {Now White has active play on the f-file.} Kg6 {Moving the King to the g-file, where White's doubled pawns provide shelter} 16. g4 Bd7 17. Bd3+ Kg7 18. h3 {Black's backward f-pawn has become a target.} Na6 19. a3 {preventing Nb4} Nc7 20. Bf5 {Perhaps I should have kept the bishops on the board, since Black's bishop is pretty bad compared to White's light-square bishop.} Bxf5 21. Rxf5 Ne7 22. Rf3 Ng6 23. Be3 {Protecting the isolated d-pawn} Rae8 24. Bd2 Re6 {protecting the f-pawn} 25. Raf1 Nh4 26. Rf3f2 Ne8 27. Ne2 Nd6 28. Ng3 {Black has e4 under control at the moment.} Ne4 29. Nf5+ {White tries to complicate things.} Kg6 30. Nxh4+ Rxh4 31. Re2 Rd6 32. Bb4 Re6 33. Rfe1 {The knight is now pinned.} b6 34. a4 c5 {Black forgot about the pin, but this doesn't cost him any material. Eventually, this costs him the game.} 35. dxc5 bxc5 36. Bxc5 Nxc5 37. Re2xe6 Nxe6 38. Rxe6 {White's rook is much better placed than Black's.} Rh7 39. Rd6 Rb7 {The b-pawn is a goner and so is the d-pawn.} 40. Rxd5 Rxb2 41. Ra5 Rb7 {Now White has a winning endgame.} 42. Kf2 Kf7 43. Ra6 {Prevents Ke6. Now White can march his king to f5.} Rb2+ 44. Kf3 Rb3+ 45. Ke4 Rb7 46. Kf5 Rb4 47. Rxa7+ Ke8 48. Kxf6 Rb2 49. Kxg5 Rxg2 50. h4 {Black resigns. Well, it took 50 moves to crack the Caro-Kann, so it's a solid defence indeed.}
