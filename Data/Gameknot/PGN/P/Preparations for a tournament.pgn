[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 {The oldest move in the book. I prefer d4 over e4, but it's a matter of personal taste. e4 suits his preferences far better.} c5 {The Sicilian. Knowing Bert, I figured we'd be playing the Alapin variation. It's an interesting anti Sicilian weapon that you don't see all that often these days, but it's an opening that has been played by players of all levels for decades.} 2. c3 {And we're playing the Alapin. The Alapin is also sometimes refered to as the anti-Sicilian. It's a pain in the ass to play against if you're not familiar with the main lines and if black somewhat cooperates than it can quickly transpose into main lines of different openings. For example it could transpose into a main line of the advanced French Defense if black responds with d5 which was long thought to be the best move after 1. e4 c5 2. c3 d5 3. e5. It can also transpose into a main line of a declined Smith Morra gambit if white plays the most popular move Nf6 via 1. e4 c5 2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5. Playing e6, which prepares d5 is arguably the most solid response by black, but is also closely related to the French defense and thus very often transposes into it. There are more examples, but I think you can catch the gist. The Alapin is used to draw Sicilian players into openings they're not familiar with and as a result often proves fatal for unprepared players. Both sides have to know the core ideas behind the transposition they'll move into.} Nf6 {I choose for the Nf6 variation since I'm not confident in my ability to win against my opponent in an advanced French. The rest from here is known theory so I will not bother annotating the next few moves.} 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 cxd4 5. Bc4 {The first move that's not maintheory. The maintheory would follow with 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. cxd4. for as far as I'm aware. There's probably theory around this move as well, but I tried to ask myself, why is Bc4 not the main move? And it occured to me that the knight on d5 is easily attacked. The reason is because we get to play Nb6, chasing away the bishop and putting the knight on a pretty good square.} Nb6 6. Bb3 {The other option in the gameknot database Bd3 has rather bad results. This is the only real option for the bishop in my opinion.} Nc6 {After this move I'm sort of in the dark for as far as theory goes. It probably continues with d6, though after that I'm not sure if I'd want to develop the dark squared bishop via a fianchetto. Also an extra note which I thought of a week after playing this game: I could have played dxc3 which a lot of lower rated players most likely would have done and which I seriously considered mind you. However that allows Nxc3. After which white has an overwhelming lead in development and enough space in my opinion to do something with it. dxc3 Nxc3 Nc6 and white is doing just fine. In this position White can even got as far as consider the move f4 in my opinion and really cramp Black's position. Either that or Nf3 d6 Bf6. Black can't respond with dxe5 because of Nxe5, targeting the f7 square. Nxe5 Bxe5 is probably needed after that. Then it's questionable what Black plays. The trade of queens means a centralised rook on an already vulnerable position so it's most likely not the answer. Developing the light squared bishop probably gets met with Nb5 threatening a fork and really pouring on the pressure. e6, trying to develop the dark squared bishop has the same problem. Then there's f6, chasing away the bishop, but it can just retreat and then continue it's attack with the Nb5 combination later. That is of course but one variation, black isn't forced to play d6 after all, but I think you get my point when I say that white gets adequate compensation.} 7. cxd4 e6 {e6! According to my opponent it's not the most active nor most played variation. If someone could be so good to inform me what the most popular reply is, you'd have my gratitude. The position reminds me of some strange French defence. Black has to be incredibly careful here because the f7 pawn is rather weak and white might have ideas of f4.} 8. Nc3 {Developing another piece and watching over the e4 and d5 square. The pin of Bb4 seems good, but I have my doubts wether or not I can afford to wait a move to undermine his center.} d6 {I was considering to play d5, but I think a trade has to be forced here. If white develops solidly then black's position will eventually get too cramped and his light squared bishop will become a nightmare. Also it's hard for my knights to reach the other side of the board right now where they'll eventually be needed. if a trade is forced then my knights will probably get a little more room to move so that I can eventually develop my light squared bishop. I anticipate Bf4 developing a minor piece as well as aiding in the dxe issue.} 9. Bf4 {As anticipated, probably the best response.} dxe5 10. dxe5 {Bxe5 wouldn't work because of f6 so this is the correct way to recapture. Now the queens are staring at each other.} Qxd1+ {This might not be neccesary, but I think his queen was going to prove stronger then mine in the end. The plan is 11. Rxd1  Bb4 12. Nf3 O-O 13. O-O After that I can start working on moving my knight on b6 so that eventually I can play b6 and Bb7.} 11. Rxd1 {At this point it was time to asses the position. Bert told me that he was quite pleased about his position, but that he doesn't like his dark squared bishop which indeed isn't too great. I think Black's position is quite decent and rather easy to play. The plans for both sides should be to finish development and improve our bad pieces. In my case it's my bishop on c8, in his case his bishop on g4. The position is in my opinion slightly in favor of white because black has a hard time gaining presence in the center, but black's position is really solid and thus hard to break through.} Bb4 {Pinning the knight and developing to a good square. Bc5 targets the weak f2 square, but Black has no presence to take advantage of it so I chose Bb4 instead.} 12. Bg5 {Questionable in my opinion, but it has its merits. Black could grab a pawn here but it gets met by Rd8 checkmate. Aside from setting up that obvious little trap there's more merit to this, namely getting his bishop to a better square. I decide to get my king to safety.} O-O 13. f4 {Didn't see this one coming, but it fits our vision to always play for a win.. I'm not sure how this attack would work, but it'll be interesting to see how he pulls it off. I think adding more pawns to the attack is too dangerous, but probably neccesary if you go all-out. His king has already become quite a bit more vulnerable now though. I think it was better for white to just develop and play some positional chess ( though that's the type of chess he dislikes and I'm best at ).  It's not quite clear how black should proceed from here.} Na5 {This is the move I come up with. It not only attacks the bishop with the intention of giving him doubled pawns, but also frees the a4-e8 diagonal for my bishop to move into after Bd7. After that my rooks will be connected and I can maybe punish his questionable king safety. Black should be better here.} 14. Bc2 {Moving the bishop out of the way.} Bd7 {A mistake on my part in my opinion. I should have taken his knight, created an isolated pawn on c3 and then I should have played this move. This move gives him the time to play Ne2.} 15. Rd3 {Defending against the threat of Bxc3 creating doubled pawns. At least that was my theory anyway.} Rac8 {Still aiming for the isolated pawn.} 16. Rg3 {"Rd3 had nothing to do with preventing the isolated pawn, though if you want to give me the bishop pair I'll gladly accept it." I should have seen this much coming. Now he's threatening the classic Bf6 or Bh6 type of threat. His bishop on c2 is also looking directly at my king which I don't like one bit. I'll have to consider how to deal with that the next upcoming move. I can't let allow him to play Rxg7.} Kh8 {I chose Kh8 as my defense. I came to the conclusion that Bxh7 isn't really much of a threat since his rook and bishop aren't enough to checkmate me by themselves. This also makes him unable to play the Bh6/Bf6 ideas because I can just take and my king will still be sufficiently safe considering the limited amount of pieces he'll have to attack with. I considered g6 as well in this positon but with a pawn on e5 he'd just play his bishop on the f6 square which is really annoying, especially if he's going to move his knight over from g1 all the way to for example g5. He could create some massive threats then.  Now that I temporarily got some breathing room the next plan on my agenda should be the isolated pawn and to get rid of the strong bishop on g5.} 17. a3 {Chasing away the bishop and tempting me to play Bxc3. I believe in the weakness of his isolated pawn, he believes in the strenght of the bishop pair in an endgame. This is why I like chess, it's essentially a clash of ideas.} Bxc3+ 18. bxc3 Bb5 {Preventing castling and getting to a better square.} 19. Rh3 {Oh lord, here it starts. I knew it was coming, but couldn't really do much to stop it.} h6 {Only way to stop that doesn't lose for as far as I can tell. f6 loses. Maybe I should have played this move first rather then play Bb5.} 20. Bf6 {I predicted Be7 but instead he played this move. I had to admit afterwards, this move is better. Not only because it just is, but because I was going to grind him down into a winning endgame, this holds more chances for him. Essentially White's attack can't be stopped now but black will win some material as compensation. There's 2 options here. 20. Bf6 Re8, accepting that Rxh6 follows after which Black plays 21. Rxh6 Kg8. 22. Bh7+ Kf8 23. Rh3 gxf6. 24. exf6 Nd5! After which black can stop checkmate because he can stop the f6 pawn, giving black room to flee. The other option is one with a forced repetition, which is most likely to be played. That happens after 20. ... gxf6 21. Rh3+ Kg8 22. Bh7+ Kh8 23. Bc2, etc. which is a draw by repetition. There's also another variation which is also drawish and can also be a draw by repetition if the response to gxf6 is exf6. After which white plays Rfd8 Rxh6+ g8 with another draw by repetition or a king chase if he so desires. I hope we're just going for the second option. I'm not confident in my ability to flee all over the map.} gxf6 21. exf6 {The third option. This might just get complicated.} Rfd8 {Making room on f8 for my king.} 22. Rxh6+ Kg8 23. Bh7+ Kf8 24. Bd3 {Black can take the bishop on d3, but it gets followed by Rh8 checkmate. } Kg8 {This move is neccesary and from here a 3fold repetition could follow with Bh7+. White can win the bishop on b5 and although tempting, I'm not sure if it actually wins for white. White's king is rather vulnerable over there and black should have little trouble regaining material.} 25. Bxb5 Rxc3 {He's 1 pawn ahead, but it's rather vulnerable on that f-file and black has quite a possible checks. The hunted becomes the hunter.} 26. h4 {The correct move. Black doesn't have an h-pawn, white does. The logical thing is to push that thing into oblivion ( not literally ). The pawn on a3 looks tasty, but I don't think Black can afford too long to stop those threats.} Nac4 {"Knights on the rim are dim" as they'd say in a kid's chess class. My knight fulfilled it's purpose there and now it's time for a new task at hand. The goal is to reroute it all the way to f5 if possible.} 27. Ne2 {This move is a mistake, though it's not althat obvious at first. It's interesting though because several moves ago this would have been the correct move. The position isn't easy to play for white either, the reason why Ne2 doesn't work is because White in this position would have wanted to play Rh3 at some point, chasing away my rook from that strong 3th rank. Before you can play that you need a knight on g1 in case Black captures  as to prevent another set of doubled pawns. With a knight on e2 the rook can't develop itself properly. It's not a superobvious mistake, and I think we can say that this move is the first big inaccuracy ( or even blunder ) in the game.} Rxa3 {Taking the pawn while I still can.} 28. Kf2 {Kf2 with the idea of developing his rook that way.} Nd2 {I'm not 100% sure how to stop the pawns so instead I opt to play agressive and force a mating pattern. If I want to get checkmate then I'll have to involve my knights anyway. This however is a mistake. Better is Ne3 aiming for the fork on g4 after which black should have an easy game. He can prevent the fork, but my knight will be far too powerful to stop.} 29. Ng3 Rd4 {Getting another strong piece in the attack.} 30. Rc1 {Moving my knight on b6 means it's checkmate. It's not played because he assumes I wouldn't notice, but to restrict the last knight from joining in.} Rxf4+ 31. Ke2 Rxg3 {Trading knights.} 32. Kxd2 Rf2+ 33. Ke1 Rb2 {I could have taken the pawn on g2 there, but I was still trying to figure out a way to stop his mating threats.} 34. Rd1 {Another checkmate in 1, this time it's stopped differently.} Nd5 {The only move that stops checkmate in 1. ( aside from Rd2, but that would be silly )} 35. Rc1 {Creating another checkmate in 1 threat.} Rc3 {I decide to be done playing games. I just want to trade rooks , bring my rook to his kingside, snatch another pawn or so and go in a winning endgame.} 36. Rxc3 Nxc3 37. Bd3 Rxg2 {Finally winning the pawn on g2, he didn't have the time to move it since his bishop was attacked.} 38. Rh5 {This is actually trickier then you'd think, if he can get his rook to c5 then he'll have a mating thread that I can't stop. I have to stay vigilant.} Nd5 {Blocking off the 5th rank. The other option was to play c5, but I rather like my knight on d5 or so I thought.} 39. Bh7+ Kf8 40. Be4 {Walking right into a fork... Or so i thought. There's 1 move here that prevents a draw from happening. I overlooked this move quite a few times.} Nxf6 {The only move to keep an advantage for black under the idea that he can't take my rook because I'll take his.} 41. Bxg2 Nxh5 42. Bxb7 {We enter the endgame, the part of the game where I'm worst at. I can see a draw happening here if he manages to get 2 pawns for his bishop and I'm sure he's fully aware of this.} e5 43. Ke2 f5 44. Kf3 Ke7 45. Bc8 {It hits me just how strongly I dislike endgames. I'm 2 pawns up, yet promoting will require sufficient technique.} Kf6 46. Ke3 Ng3 {This move is neccesary in my opinion. Not only does it stop the advance to h5, but it protects the f5, e4 and e2 squares which will be crucial.} 47. Kf3 {Threatening the knight.} f4 {He only has a very limited amount of squares he can go to. I feel like Ba6 might be neccesary here for him. He should accept that he'll have to play for a draw and try his hardest to sac his bishop in a way that it gains my 2 pawns.} 48. Kg4 {Probably not correct, but the position is very hard for white.} Ne2 {Protecting the f4 square so I can play e4 in the future.} 49. Bf5 {Trying to stop e4. this would work if it wasn't for my a-pawn.} a5 50. Bd7 {Forced to come back and stop the pawn.} e4 51. h5 {Tricky. Let's say i play f3, he plays h6, i play f2, etc. I promote first, but he promotes with check. This gives him the advantage as he might be able to gobble up material during a barrage of checks or even worse, maybe pin my king in front of my queen which would mean I lose.} f3 {I play f3 because I'm not scared of the pawnrace. As soon as he plays h7 I play Kg7 making him unable to promote.} 52. Kh3 {He realises this, this however loses.} Nf4+ {The plan is to sac my knight for his h-pawn. After that his king is too far away from my 2 pawns to stop me from promoting, even if he were to play Bb5 somewhere i can just play e3, e2, Bxe2 fxe2 and he can't stop the promotion. Not recapturing the knight means I get a free pawn for nothing and my king can get involved in the defense of my 2 pawns as it doesn't have to look over the g7 square anymore.} 53. Kh2 {He realises that after Kh4 Nxg5 Kxh5 he won't be able to reach my pawns in time. Kh2 is played with the idea of playing for stalemate which shouldn't happen unless I'm careless. I'm kind of sad because of that, saccing a knight for an unstoppable pawn isn't something you get to do every game.} Nxh5 {Taking the pawn.} 54. Bc6 Ke5 55. Kg1 Kf4 56. Kf2 e3+ {The game is more or less over at this point, but we decide to play on under the motto: "If this ends up stalemate then I got a lot of studying to do".} 57. Kf1 Ng3+ {And here he resigns. It's difficult for black not to promote a pawn here. I'm pretty sure we both can still play a little better then this. Undoubtedly the locations at which he played ( he made numerous moves on the bus for example ) and me being distracted ( I'm a fan of multitasking ) had some factor in at least 1 or 2 moves we played. It'll be interesting to see what's going to happen in the tournament. I pray we don't have to play each other, but if we do we'll play our hearts out I'm sure.}
