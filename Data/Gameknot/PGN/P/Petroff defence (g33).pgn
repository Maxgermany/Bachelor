1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 {Standard opening.} 5. Nc3 d5 {?! Not a great pawn sac. Maybe Nxc3 should have been considered?} 6. Qe2 {Next few moves develop as expected.} Be7 {Black will loose a little tempo here having to move the DSB twice in a matter of moves.} 7. Nxe4 dxe4 8. Qxe4 O-O 9. Bc4 {Bd3 looks more obvious although is easily defended with 9...g6   a continuation would lead to black having good compensation for the pawn if he could get Bishops into play. } Bd6 10. O-O {White is aiming for a quick development. The center is totally open. White has a good lead in development.} Re8 11. Qd3 Nc6 12. b3 {! Nice move. Allows white to get DSB into play.} Qf6 13. Bb2 {Great move. Instead of holding on to pawns white is looking at bigger picture and attacks.} Qxb2 14. Ng5 Be6 {After 14.. g6 15. Bxf7+, Kg7. 16. Bxe8, Qe5. 17. Qc3,  Kd4. 18. f4  very nice  :)} 15. Bxe6 fxe6 {Creates an isolated pawn but allows more room for King to escape.} 16. Qxh7+ Kf8 17. Rae1 {IS c3 stronger? This move allows Queen to return home & defend.} Qf6 18. Qh5 {Better than Qh8+} Kg8 19. Re3 {Looking to get to h3 and force a back row mate.} Bf4 {Black trying to rid advanced knight.} 20. Qh7+ Kf8 21. Qh8+ {White forced into playing winning exchange and wait for the win.} Ke7 22. Rxe6+ {Good move. Wins Queen & pawn in exchange for Rook and Knight} Qxe6 23. Qxg7+ Kd6 24. Nxe6 Rxe6 25. d4 {Queenside pawn charge to pressure blacks king.} Rae8 {Black has to get rooks working togeather to make up for the lack of Queen.} 26. c4 {Pressing forward } Re8e7 27. Qf8 Re6e4 {Putting pressure on pawn.} 28. Qf5 {White spots something more valuable.} Rxd4 {Black picks up the free pawn... but doesn't spot....} 29. c5# {Nice finish. Mate with a pawn   :)}
