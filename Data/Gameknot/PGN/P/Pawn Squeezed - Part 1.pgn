1. Nf3 {Hi everyone, I have another two games to annotate against a 1900  rated player called grundnorm.  In both games he pushed his queenside pawns up the board and I was never in the games?  So, what went wrong, maybe you the jury can help here.  This game starts as a Reti Opening.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {4. ....... d6 - preparing c5 or e5.} 5. d4 O-O 6. Be2 e5 {6. ...... e5 - I counter in the centre to try to bust up white's strong pawn centre as stated in my previous note.} 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 f6 9. Bh4 Nc6 10. O-O g5 11. Bg3 {11. Bg3 - a black kingside pawn storm just does not quite materialise.} Nh6 12. d5 Ne7 13. Nd2 Ng6 14. f3 Nf4 15. Bf2 Bd7 16. c5 Nxe2+ 17. Qxe2 Nf7 {17. .......... Nf7 - I am wondering whether it would have been better to have played dxc5 here to try and break up white's queenside pawn rush that grundnorm is just about to hit me with.} 18. Nc4 Qe7 19. b4 Rfd8 20. Na5 Rdb8 21. Nb5 Bxb5 22. Qxb5 {22. Qxb5 - white's position is becoming overwhelming and it is a wonder that this game lasts until move 37.} a6 23. Qd3 Bf8 24. Rac1 Qe8 25. Qd2 Nd8 {25. ......... Nd8 - I can do little more than shuffle my pieces around on the back rank.  White's pieces are poised for a break through.} 26. Nb3 Qf7 27. Rc3 Rbc8 28. Rfc1 {28. Rfc1 - this doubling up becomes a battering ram on the c file.} Qd7 29. c6 bxc6 30. dxc6 Qe6 {30. .......... Qe6 - the d file is closed, for now.} 31. Na5 Rcb8 {31.  .......... Rcb8 - I try to sieze control of the newly opened b file but it does not work.  Maybe, in the light of what happens later on, would it have been better for the a rook to have gone to the b file instead.  I did consider this but it would have left my weak a6 pawn undefended.} 32. a3 Qf7 33. Nc4 Nxc6 34. Ne3 {34. Ne3 - the c file is now opened.  I did not want this but I did not want the white horse to gallop in on b6.  If cxb6 then the c pawn can do a lot of damage.} Nd8 35. Rc3xc7 {35. Rxc7 - the c pawn falls and the white rook is a bone in the throat.  Glenda chooses e6.} Qe6 36. Nd5 Kh8 37. Nb6 {37. Nb6 - my rook is trapped so I wave the white flag, a brilliant breakthrough from white.  It is time for round 2.}
