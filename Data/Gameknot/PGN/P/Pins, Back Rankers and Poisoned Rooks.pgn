1. e4 {e4. Centre opening - lets the Bishop and Queen out.} c5 {c5. The Sicilian Defense, which is one of the most commonly played openings in the world.} 2. Nf3 {Nf3. The normal line of the Sicilian.} e6 {e6, deviating from the main line. This is supposed to strengthen d5 and also let the Bishop and Queen come out when needed.} 3. d4 {d4, letting the dark-squared Bishop come out and also not blocking in the light squared Bishop.} cxd4 {Exchange of the pawns, letting White have a N on d4.} 4. Nxd4 {Recapture.} Nc6 {Developing a Knight. If NxN, White will have swapped off the only developed piece and after bxN Black can push into the centre with d5 and develop quickly on the queenside.} 5. Nc3 {Defending the e pawn and developing a piece.} a6 {Protects against N or B to b5.} 6. Be3 {Defending the Knight and developing a piece.} d5 {An attempt to go through the middle with an attack.} 7. exd5 {Swaps off the pawn, as I preferred this line to not taking the pawn: for example ...dxe4 Nxe4 leaves two knights in the centre easily attacked.} exd5 {Recaptures.} 8. Be2 {Develops the Bishop - ready to castle. Notice Black has one piece developed and White has 4.} Be6 {Black now has 2 pieces developed. Both people carry on developing in the next few moves.} 9. O-O Nf6 10. Re1 Bb4 11. Nxc6 {Nxc6 lets the B come back to defend the N; if this move is not played first the Knight on d4 drops.} bxc6 12. Bd2 c5 13. a3 Bxc3 14. Bxc3 d4 15. Bd2 {In this position Black is more forward and has his pieces developed well - White has the slight advantage in development due to the Rook on e1.} O-O 16. Bf3 {The Bishop is now on a better diagonal; the Rook is on a better file.} Rb8 {So Black does not lose a tempo.} 17. b3 Qc7 {Qc7 - this seems not to do much; it attacks the h2 square but now the Q and R are in a diagonal line...} 18. Qc1 {Threatens Bf4.} Ng4 {Threatening h2, but White can now swap off...} 19. Bxg4 Bxg4 20. Bf4 {...so he can get the pin.} Qc6 {Moves the Queen to a safe place.} 21. Bxb8 Rxb8 22. Qf4 {Forking the Rook and Bishop, meaning Black has to move his Queen back.} Qc8 23. Re5 {White takes the initiative, threatening Rxc5, winning a pawn (if QxR, QxR , Qf8 Qf8 and Whte will win).} Be6 24. Rxc5 {Threatening the Queen, and winning a pawn.} Qd8 {Black does not want to swap off - he is losing and tries to keep his pieces on the board.} 25. h3 {Prevents mate. Black should do the same; many of the tricks are to do with mate.} Qb6 {Does not threaten anything; QxR QxR Qf8 and White will win.} 26. Rd1 Rd8 {The Rook is finally threatened...} 27. Rxd4 {White does not bother to defend it! Another pawn is won. If Black takes the Rook on c5, RxR  Qf8 Rxf8  Kxf8 and White is up by a long way. } Rxd4 28. Qxd4 h6 {Thinks the threats are over...} 29. Rc8+ {Rc8 ! The discovered attack on the Queen makes Black resign.}
