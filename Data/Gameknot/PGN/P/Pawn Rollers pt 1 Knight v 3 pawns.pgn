1. e4 c5 {My favourite} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Bd3 {!? I have never seen this before or since.} g6 {I like dragon type formations} 6. h3 {Was this needed?} Bg7 7. Na3 Nc6 8. c3 Bd7 9. Be3 O-O 10. Nf3 {when will Qd2 come preparing to remove the bishop} Rc8 {I don't know what I was thinking here Maybe rb8 was better looking for a pawn push} 11. g4 {Qd2  should be coming soon} e6 12. Nb5 d5 13. Nd6 Rb8 {The knight finds a nice home} 14. Bc5 {Now I found a combination} dxe4 15. Nxe4 Nxe4 16. Bxf8 {Better was Bxe4} Nxc3 17. Qc1 Nxa2 18. Rxa2 Qxf8 {Now material is even however black has a few things in his favour. The weak b2 pawn, two bishops and a safe king} 19. O-O Nb4 20. Ra3 Nxd3 21. Rxd3 {? loses the exchange} Bb5 22. Rdd1 Bxf1 23. Kxf1 Rd8 {Looking to exchange} 24. Re1 Qb4 {Two attackers on b2. However Qc7 forces Qb6 and QxQ axb6 means it may be easier for white to defend and try and get into a 4v3 endgame which should be drawn.} 25. Re2 Qd6 26. Rd2 Qa6+ 27. Kg2 Rxd2 28. Qc8+ Bf8 29. Nxd2 Qc6+ {Now I have a queen trade.} 30. Qxc6 bxc6 {f3 should be played putting whites pawns on light squares} 31. Nc4 Bg7 32. f4 f5 {A trade is good for me meaning there is a lone pawn on a dark square at f4. I want to get all whitepawns on dark squares} 33. g5 {my opponent helps} Kf7 34. h4 {again} Ke7 35. Kf3 {I run to the Q-Side looking to push pawns and force white into defending b2 and my threat. After this I can eat his K-Side pawns} Kd7 36. Ke3 c5 37. Kd3 Kc6 38. b3 {Now the knight can move} Bd4 39. b4 Bf2 {The bishop is in} 40. Ne5+ Kb5 41. bxc5 Kxc5 42. Nd7+ {Preparing Nf7} Kb4 {I look to push the a-pawn} 43. Kc2 Bxh4 44. Nf8 {To late I feel} a5 45. Nxe6 Bg3 {Now the knight is tied down. Nf8 Bxf4 Nxh7 Looks fine apart from the a-pawn being a big threat} 46. Nc7 a4 47. Kb2 Kc4 {remove the check on d5 also get closer to K-Side where my pawns will escape} 48. Ka3 Bxf4 49. Ne6 Bxg5 {Here we go} 50. Nxg5 h6 51. Nf3 g5 52. Kxa4 g4 {now it is a matter of time. Can the knight hold out and let the king get over there?} 53. Ne5+ Kd4 54. Nf7 f4 {I sac the h-pawn to try and queen the f and g pawns} 55. Nxh6 g3 56. Nf5+ Ke4 57. Nh4 f3 {White resigns because he can't stop the pawns. Later we found a line that could draw if black want to keep the h-pawn but Black could eventually win if he played correct even in that line.\\  Knight v 3 Pawns 0-1 to three pawns  Can the pawn roller be stopped.
