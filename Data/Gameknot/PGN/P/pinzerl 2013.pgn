1. c4 {Probably one of the nicest games I have ever played, not in the sens that it contains beautiful combinations, or sacrifices, but because of the accurate moves I consider having made at the right time. I guess there are still much to say about them, but though.} f5 {When I see f5, at this level, I usually think the guy knows better than me...} 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. g3 Be7 5. Bg2 O-O 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. O-O {and after this move, I mostly consider I have to play for the draw before thinking better} b6 8. a3 Bb7 9. Bf4 Nh5 10. Qd2 {I am ready to exchange my bishop. With c4 f5, I consider knights may have the prevalence. and actually, knights where the only survivors in this game.} Nxf4 11. Qxf4 g5 {Looks like totman had the win in mind. You can't blame him.} 12. Qd2 Na5 13. Qd3 {still responding to every attack move. I was happy totoman didn't find any better. I didn't either, actually. Maybe there was nothing better at that moment.} h6 {the black king side pawns line looks ready to swarm by...} 14. b4 {So I had to counter and find some space by myself} Nc6 15. c5 {I really think hard the next 4-5 moves, with a lot of variations} a5 16. d5 {this point is crucial. I had to consider axb, exd or an escape for the knight. I have to admit I barely considered what will come next, thinking more that he could play Nb8, potentially coming back to d7 when the black pawn would be gone.} Na7 {I guess Nb5 was his main goal, here} 17. cxb6 cxb6 18. bxa5 bxa5 {looks like i am in charge for the cleaning} 19. Ne5 {that's the risky business. I pointed out that g6 was clear and an eventual option in case of trouble due to f8 - e7} Bf6 {and I have to admit I under estimated this move...} 20. Nc4 {So I came back here, which was not my goal} Rc8 {totoman will now put all his forces to the holes I created...} 21. dxe6 {And I made one more... The idea was to exchange without loss, so I had to defend fast my knights} Bxg2 22. Kxg2 {bye bye bishops... the last one won't last.} dxe6 23. Rac1 Qc7 {two on c4 and three on c3 if c4 goes back...} 24. Nd1 {I considered patiently all the options, and I fond out this one had to be the best to help at e to h defense.} Rfd8 {fair enough, but without big threats} 25. Qb3 Qc6+ {I think totoman could have reserved this move for a later trick. Here there is no trick.} 26. Kg1 Qe4 {and this attack seems to me without consequence. actually I will have the surprise moves now.} 27. Nde3 f4 28. Ng2 fxg3 29. hxg3 h5 {pressing} 30. Nce3 {with a constant threat now on e6 (which strangely will last the most)} Rxc1 31. Rxc1 h4 32. f3 {and this is my surprise... I felt really comfortable with the next four-five moves. And for the first time in the game I started to consider winning } Qe5 33. Ng4 {I thought he would prefer to take g3...} Qxe2 {but no...} 34. Nxf6+ Kh8 {that was probably the good answer. But this leads to the fact that e6 is still under the queen charge.} 35. Qe3 {I could have played Re1, the next move would have probably be the same. Here I force at least the rook exchange, with a preference for the queens.} Rd1+ 36. Rxd1 {forced} Qxd1+ 37. Kh2 hxg3+ 38. Kxg3 {so let us consider the action now. My two last pawns are globally protected. I am pretty sure I can assure the draw without a problem. Hiw own pawns are unprotected and far from each other. Hiw knights is poorly placed and under threat. Black has to solve many problems at once.} Qd6+ 39. f4 gxf4+ 40. Nxf4 {having considered that e5 would not have been a real threat: N4 could have be gone to d5 or h5 with great comfort.} Nc6 {finally coming back.} 41. Ne4 {getting the queen out of my diagonal} Qe5 {Oh my! this is a huge mistake, as I can now force the exchange...} 42. Qc3 Qxc3+ 43. Nxc3 {I had calculated a reasonable risk of draw. Of course, tototman could have imagined to catch my pawn, for example by playing Nb4, but I would not have taken his knight for my pawn. Mating with my last two knight, though theoretically possible, needs the benevolence of the opponent. I had to preserve my pawn. And it was quite easier than it looks, to impeach black night to go to the b1 - c2 - c4 or b5 threatening positions.} e5 {thanks, the knight had to move anyway} 44. Nfd5 {as the knight on c3 blocks the two b1 and b5 position, My other knight had the simple job to block the c2 and c4 position. I had in mind Ng2-e3, but now I can come by the center, which is much more comfortable.} Nd4 {pointing on c2 already} 45. Ne3 {blocked} Kg7 46. Kf2 {there was no more short way... } Kf6 47. Ke1 Kg5 48. Kd2 Kf4 49. Kd3 {ideally positionned, now: my king block the c2 and c4, so my Ne3 can go fishing} Nb3 50. Ned5+ Kf3 {no, I didn't forget the e-column threat. It was included in the package.} 51. Nb6 Nc5+ 52. Kc4 {I was ready to give my c3 knight for the e-column pawn, without any regret: he had done well and deserved to rest. The idea was no to chase the black knight far from his own pawn, taking the pawn on e2, so I had his king as far as possible from a-column.} Nb7 53. Kb5 e4 54. Ka6 Nc5+ {and all of sudden I foresaw a last possible problem. I had seen the idea if he plays something like e3, then Ne4... Well then I have N6d5. But there is one thing I had not considered as you'll see in the next moves.} 55. Kxa5 e3 {still ok} 56. Kb4 Nd3+ 57. Kb5 Nb2 58. Nc4 {and this has been a slightly mistake. Because now he could have played Nd1. In that case I cannot take his knight of course, because then e3-e2-e1 is unstoppable, even with the Ne5+ momentum. But then I thought, ok, if he plays Nd1, I play Nxe3, that's all...} Nd3 59. a4 e2 60. Nxe2 Kxe2 61. a5 {I think it is unstoppable} Nf4 62. a6 Ne6 63. Kc6 Kd3 64. Na5 {unnecessary to save him. Some kind of sympathy for my last brave knight} Nd8+ 65. Kd7 Nf7 66. a7 Ne5+ 67. Kc7 {and abandon...}
