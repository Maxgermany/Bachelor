[Opening "Guatemala defence (B00)"]

1. e4 {So, I start off with my usual.} b6 {At first, I didn't know what this was called.  It seems like the Baseman Defense, but 1...b5 is played.  But, I remembered because this was Ken played against me in our second game.  And, it is the Owen's Defense.  However, after what happened with Ken, I'm not going to be taken completely off guard, this time around.  Since, however, I'm still learning, I'm going to follow book moves here.  And, that starts with my next one.} 2. d4 Bb7 {Not surprisingly, he plays this.  I say this because it's how I think, as noted in one of charleshiggie's more recent annotations.  The idea is fianchetto, as early as, the first move to form a nice long flank.  And, what adds meaning is that it is not blocked by his N which would happen, if he played something like 1...Nf6.  And, with it, he targets my e pawn.} 3. Nc3 {And, I protect it with this move.  Now, another option was 3.Bd3  But, since I'm not that familiar with the Owen's Defense, I'm treating it like we're using Fischer Controls where the pieces are set up differently.  So, my take on that is, "Know your principles"  That means follow the guidelines carefully.  And, what I remember is that the N should be developed before the B.} e6 {Likewise, Henry continues developing by opening up a line for his Bf8.  His other plan is to pin my Nc3.  But, that doesn't bother me.  First I continue with my development, and when he pins...} 4. Nf3 Bb4 5. Bd2 {Regardless of what side it's on, this is how I break the pin.  In addition, this develops even more.} a5 {At first, I didn't see the point of this move.  But, Henry plays this to get a pawn chain and a semi open (I believe).  I say that because on the Q side, his pawns are only on one color.  And, it's like that until we get to the d file.  But, I think it's an inaccuracy because it doesn't develop.  More importantly, however, is that it blocks his mobility of his Bb4.} 6. Bd3 {With that being said, I continue developing.  I do keep in mind that he'll exchange my N for B.  I did ask myself if it was worth it and if I get anything out of it.  For me, it's a no, but there is no choice.  With that pin, he's going to force.  This is why after 3...e6, I think it would've been better to defend with the move played here.  I thought nothing of this pin since it happens a lot.  But, small details can make a huge difference.  And, the difference is that he exchanges when I'm least ready to do it.} Bxc3 7. Bxc3 Nf6 {And, that allows him to continue with his development.} 8. e5 {I considered castling here.  But, I remember a similar position appearing in the French Defense.  And, it was in a lecture by GM Susan Polgar.  She said in that position, the best move is this.  That boils down to kicking the N since it's forced to exchange.  In the process, not only do you gain tempo, but you have a solid pawn chain in the center, which is where it's most needed.} Nd5 {As expected.  Once again, I asked myself if exchanging was appropriate.  Unlike before, I was ready to do it, but what stopped me was that I'd wind up with doubled, in the process.  Since this is now the midgame, by my books, I feel that allowing doubled pawns would not be a good way to go.  So, I do the same thing that Ken did with me in our first training game by retreating, rather then, give into Henry, again.} 9. Bd2 Nc6 {Which enables him to continue with his development.} 10. Ng5 {Rather then castle, I asked myself if I have a threat that would be difficult to drive off.  At first, I thought of this move as a cheapo tactic, and almost castled.  But, then I looked again at the board.  And, then, what occurred to me was what happened in my game against bhidragon since there are similarities with this position.  The entire story for my side isn't just my Ng5 and Bd2.  As now, my Qd1 is also a key player.  And, with it the threat is difficult, as I'm targeting his weakness being his f7 pawn since that's the weakest pawn on the board.  So, I allow him to take a center pawn.  For, in exchange, I play my next move and threaten Qf3 which would pose difficulties for Henry to handle.} Nxd4 11. Bxh7 Nb4 12. O-O {What I forgot is that his Nd3 prevents me from doing it.  And, I, believe it or not, considered 12.Qh5 to threaten mate.  But, this time, it would be easy to drive off.  Thus, it would become a cheapo tactic which would give a space advantage after 12...g6  So, I played this to connect the Rooks but forgot that 12.c3 was best, as this wins material.} g6 {Figuring that I'd move my Queen to h5, regardless, Henry plays this.  But, I'm not interested because of what I know.  Instead, I play the move that was available a move earlier with the same result.} 13. c3 Ndc2 {For now, Henry holds off on what's to come by hitting my Rook.  So, I go after him again.} 14. Rc1 {If, however, the N stays there, he prevents me from taking, but then, I'd hit his N with 15.a3.  But, he makes a mistake by taking on a2 (presumably, to prevent me from hitting it.)  That's fine because I take back on c2, winning a piece for pawn.} Nxa2 15. Rxc2 Bd5 {In this position, Henry is trying to pin and win my R with Bb4.} 16. c4 {So, I put a stop to that by hitting his B.  Once he retreats, I think about where my decisive mistake occurred against Ken, in our second game.  As he said that my assessment about mobility need to be better.  That's where I didn't defend accurately, and once his N came down, he was going to win a piece without compensation.  So, I think along the same line with 17.b3, thinking that he did not evalulate correctly.  But, what I overlooked was where he retreat.  For, that is going to prevent me from taking his N as his N will be protected by the pawns.  Though, now I regret it and think that better was to exchange since I'm ahead.  But, it's difficult to know.  What I know is that when I blunder, that N will cause damage and by not taking, it will become dangerous.  So, I should've exchanged but evaluated incorrectly, myself.  That's because my focus became trying to take away his weakest pawn on the board in an attempt to expose his K which was foolish.} Bb7 17. b3 Nb4 18. Bxg6 {? What also came into consideration was 18.Qf3, but Henry would be able to prevent mate with 18...Rf8, so it would've been unsound.  Therefore, best was 18.Bxb4, at once.  However, he would grab my Ng5 which leaves the Rook attacked, which I didn't want to allow.  But, by playing this, he equalizes.  } fxg6 19. Qg4 {?? Don't be fooled, though, as that's where my plan to get a passed pawn came in place.  Therefore, I saw that he would play 19...Nxc2.  But, if I retreated, he would keep hitting it with his Nb4 which is why better would've been to exchange.  And, with it being said, given that I also didn't want to retreat, this sac was deliberate.  As I thought that in the process I'm gaining the time that I need to get a passed pawn.  It was only after a lecture with Jack and my win against Ted that I realized that I need to consider more then just passed pawns in my assessments since I had one in that same game where I blundered a piece for two pawns and should've lost.  But, just one passer wouldn't have cut the mustard.  Yet, I was also thinking about what Jack told me when I wrongly thought that Tom had a win after resigning.} Nxc2 {With that being said, this is actually how I get the passer, but it involves sacking a piece for two pawns.} 20. Nxe6 dxe6 21. Qxe6+ {As now, there is nothing aside from or in front of my e5 which is why it's a passed pawn.  And, instead of getting nervous, this is where I become confident and feel that I have a win.  But, because I misunderstood what Jack Stockel (in which it's very common for me to misunderstand things, my assessment was way off.)  And, this is where I realize that I've got even more to learn.} Kf8 22. Qxg6 {?? His next move is where I figure out that I'm in rough shape.  In this case, it was an oversight.  As the plan behind this was to play 23.Bh6+.  Obviously, if he takes my B, then I'd take back.  But, I had anticipated ...Ke8 to follow, after which, I'd follow up with e6 to threaten mate.  Yes, it can be driven off, so it was not the main reason for that line.  Instead, what came to mind is that, "Passed pawns must be pushed."  Afterall, that fact is what makes them dangerous.  But, his next move prevents all of that since I overlooked where his Queen is located.  In return, that piece is gone for a pawn.} Qxd2 23. Qf5+ {Thinking that I might be able to get a draw, perhaps or maybe the slightest chance of a win, I place Henry in check.  And, that's because of what follows when he gets out.  I thought that I could still do a lot of damage with my passed pawn.} Ke8 24. e6 Rf8 {But, he stops that with this move since my plan was to check him with 26.Qf7+, followed by advancing the pawn.  Yes, I thought that if Henry did blunder, I could push the pawn and promote which is why I, voluntarily, gave up so much material, as opposed to defending.  But, as we're going to see, it's not going to work out.} 25. Qb5+ c6 26. Qe5 {After the check, since my Rook is useless with a back rank mate threat, I bring my Queen behind the passed as it involves the same idea as putting your R behind it.} Nd4 {This is where I overlook what Henry is about to do.  At first, I thought that he would take my e pawn.  And, if he did, I'd take with check which is where I thought I had counterplay.  As now, another thing that came into consideration is the move that I play next as I have a pawn chain.  The idea was to then push with 28.f5 and then 29.f6 because white could promote in a situation like this.} 27. f4 Ne2+ {But, what didn't come to mind was why the N was out which is this move.  After which, I considered 28.Kh1 to keep the monarch in the corner.  But, after 28...Rxf4 29.Qxf4, Nxf4, he mates by taking on g2 or h2.  Seeing that I played my next move, as I thought that I was out of trouble, even after he takes.} 28. Kf2 Rxf4+ {But, I thought that Henry would take with the N, instead.  Consequently, I'm still forced to lose my Queen.} 29. Qxf4 Nxf4+ {I resigned here because after getting out of check, Henry is going to play 30...Qxg2 which forces my King away from the Rook.  From then, he is going to win that also.  And, with it, I resigned due to not being able to make any more use of my passed pawn.  In my resignation, I said that the reason for sacking so much material was to get that passed pawn.  But, now that you have won my Queen and are about to get my Rook there's nothing that I can do for that passer.  Consequently, there is no more that I can get from the game.  In general, pieces are worth more then pawns.  But, because of that lecture combined with how most GM's win, I thought that the only exception to that rule is when that pawn is a passer.  That's why I gave them away for that.  However, I learned that even with passed pawns that general fact still holds.  And, the other thing to learn (which I frequently forget) is that the assessment should come from the position, itself, and not from a game.  When I evaluate, it's almost always from a past game.  But, that's because the position allowed it.  Therefore, just because it works in one game doesn't mean that it will for another.  And, with that being said, as the title says passed pawns aren't everything.  In fact, what I learned here is that for just one, pieces are still worth more.  That's because even with one passer, the opponent can stop it with his pieces.  When that happens, your plan fails which is what leads to your downfall.  That is exactly what occured here.}
