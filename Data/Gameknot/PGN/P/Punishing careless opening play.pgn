1. e4 d5 {This game was in a Scandinavian Defense mini-tournament.  } 2. exd5 Qxd5 {The main line.  } 3. d3 {?! Not a book move and very passive, blocking the light squared bishop. More common is 3.Nc3.  } e5 {Taking control of the center.  } 4. a3 {? Wastes a tempo. ...Bb4+ is not a threat here.  } Nc6 {Continuing with development. } 5. Nc3 Qe6 6. h3 {? Another tempo waste. } Nf6 7. Bg5 Be7 8. Bxf6 {? Gives up the bishop pair for nothing. } Bxf6 9. Qe2 {? Blocks in the f1-bishop even further, and allows my next move. } Nd4 {Violates the principle, 'Move every piece once before you move any piece twice unless there is a tactic,' but this move does not lose a tempo because white's queen is forced to move again and keep an eye on the c2 square. My knight position improves, but white's queen position does not, so this is a free beneficial move. } 10. Qd2 Bd7 {Preparing queenside castling. I want my rook on the d-file. } 11. Nge2 {GK computer says this is an inaccuracy because of 11...Bg5 12.Qd1 f5, but what if 12.Qxg5? Then 12...Nxc2+ wins a rook, but there likely would be tactical complications with open lines on the kingside and the a1 knight trying not to get trapped. I considered 11...Bg5 but preferred a lead in development, pressure, active pieces, and the bishop pair to being up the Exchange with complications. } O-O-O {Should I have played 11...Bg5? Is it better? } 12. O-O-O Rhe8 13. Kb1 {?! Wastes a tempo in my opinion. I would have tried to get the f1 bishop out via g3, Rg1, and Bg2. } Bc6 {This move turns the f1 bishop into a tall pawn on the 1st rank, and clears the path of the d8-rook. } 14. Nxd4 {Logical move, trades a 2nd rank knight for a 5th rank knight. } Rxd4 {I recaptured this way to make my rook more powerful. } 15. f3 {The f1 bishop is completely useless now. } Red8 {Doubling rooks to increase the pressure on the d-file. } 16. Be2 h6 {Threatening 17...Bg5 then ...f5 and ripping open the center. } 17. Qe1 Bg5 {Unblocking the f-pawn to prepare ...f5 and an attack in the center. } 18. Qf2 f5 {As planned. } 19. h4 Be7 {I changed plans and now target white's king. } 20. g3 {Trying to restrain the kingside/central attack. } b5 {Pawn storm. My pieces' activity and open lines compared to white's passivity and blocked pieces means that my king is safe while white's king is not. } 21. Rhe1 b4 {Logical follow up. } 22. Na2 {? Computer says best was 22.axb4 Bxb4 and only a small disadvantage for white. } bxa3 {Ripping open white's king shield. } 23. b3 a5 {The a-pawn prepares to advance and attack the weak b3-pawn. } 24. Bf1 a4 {Attacking. My advantage is 3.56 pawns. } 25. b4 {? Best was 25.Nc1. This costs white about 1 pawn worth according to the computer. } Bxb4 {26.c3 fails to 26...Qb3+. } 26. Ka1 {?? Loses to the computer recommended next move. } Bxe1 {?? Logical move: attack the king, win material, simplify, then win the endgame. But better was 26...Qc4!! and 27.dxc4 loses so computer gives best play as 26â€¦Qc4 27.Kb1 Bc3 28.dxc4 Rxd1+ 29.Nc1 Rxe1 30.Qxe1 Bxe1. } 27. Qxe1 {Loses the f3 pawn but it makes no difference already. } Bxf3 28. Rb1 e4 {If 29.dxe4, then 29...Rd1! } 29. Qe3 Qf6 {Preparing a discovered check. } 30. Qe1 {?? 30.c3 was much better according to computer. } Rd4xd3+ 31. c3 Rd3d1 32. Qf2 {If 32.Rxd1 then 32...Rxd1+ wins a queen for a rook. } Rxb1+ 33. Kxb1 Qb6+ {?? 33...Rd1+ and mate in 12! But simplification is good enough to win. } 34. Qxb6 cxb6 35. Ba6+ Kc7 36. Nb4 {Opponent resigns. }
