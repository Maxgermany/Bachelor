1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. g4 {Here we have one of the more aggressive white continuations against the Caro-Kann.} Be4 {Since white has indicated a willingness to be aggressive, I decide to see if he'll advance his f pawn. This can be dangerous for black, but usually a little preparation by white first is wiser; white's king is not yet safe. The best response now is for white to play f3.} 5. f3 {Which he does. And of course black really has only one thing to do.} Bg6 6. h4 {White is continuing now with an aggressive pawn storm, with zero pieces developed! He hopes to blow black off the board entirely. Black has two responses, h5 or h6. But h6 is not nearly as good as h5, because h6 is extremely passive while h5 allows black to fight back. I saw a video of this position where a grandmaster stated (but not a 'super' grandmaster) that h5 was good for black. Fritz agrees.} h5 7. e6 {This is really overaggressive now on white's part. He wishes to disrupt the pawn structure immediately in front of the black king even before he's really ready to. Fritz here wanted Qd6 here, and ...fxe6 is also playable. I, however, decided I did not want a trio of pawns assaulting the black position after g5. It just seems too dangerous!} hxg4 {So I create room for my rook on h8 to have a say in matters first. Now all evaluations are somewhat negative as well. White responds with Frit'z choice...} 8. exf7+ Bxf7 9. fxg4 {Almost any move here is safe for black now: e6, e5, Nd7, Nf6, or what I moved, Qd6. With all of these pawns gone, white's challenge is to find a way to keep the black king under attack. This white plan could have been a bit harder to refute had he prepared a bit before launching all those pawns!} Qd6 {This also prepares to castle queenside; ...Nd7, e6 or e5 and Ne7 or f6 will all be considered, depending on white's response here. Qc7 may have been better.} 10. Kf2 {Now the awkwardness of white's position begins to become apparent. White decides he can't allow  ...Qg3, which depending could lose him the g and/or h pawns; but in so choosing, loses a valuable tempo another move may have been able to accomplish while also being positioning closer to attack. Qe2 or Nf3 were white's best choices here but white decided on Kf2.} Nf6 {...Nd7 followed by castling queenside was also playable for black; Fritz likes Nf6 better, and in the game so did I.} 11. Qf3 {Here white indicates he will continue to assault aggressively the kingside if he can: in for a penny, in for a pound appears to be his thinking. There are many continuations, all very playable for black. But black must be careful to not allow white to get a dangerous push. Nbd7 is playable, and Bg6 is possible here, after which Bd3 Bxd3 cxd3 would most likely result, doubling white's pawns on the d file. However, I decide not to trade pieces, and decide to create some tactical possibilities, one which pays off in a bit. This was Blitz; so this thinking was done quickly.} Ne4+ {This gets me a tempo for Nd7, after which I can then castle, or begin to harass the pieces in front of white's king. Yes, it would have been nice to have doubled white's pawns on the d file, but now white's attack is really sputtering.} 12. Kg2 Nd7 {The way is clear now to castle if I choose, depending on how I handle the f7 bishop.} 13. Bd3 {Nd2 was also possible here.} Bg6 {This move allows h5. Fritz much preferred ...e5. However, white had already decided what he would do next, and so the continuation starting with h5 was missed for a turn. I had another reason however for encouraging h5... a dubious reason, as it turns out, but oh well.} 14. Bf4 {Even here ...e5 is still a good move.} Qe6 {The position is becoming complex. White has disrupted the black kingside pawn structure and may win a pawn, in return for dubious king safety and his own connected pawns being advanced a tad far. Note I can still castle; the white dark-squared bishop does not prevent it.} 15. h5 Bf7 {I thought about Bh7, and rejected it. I wanted the h file clear for my rook. What was the reason for ...Bg6? Was it worth the tempo? Not really; I gambled there. I wanted him to advance the h pawn, and not the g pawn at this point so I could hopefully get in Nf6, after which advancing the g pawn would lose the h pawn, and so my knight will be able to remain there for the time being, and that is what I wanted. But white could, after h5,  immediately move g5, and then black will have trouble. It's getting cramped! And if I allow white too much leeway, I'll be in for a difficult defense after all.} 16. Nh3 {But I lucked out; white is continuing with his plan rather than really seeing the board! g5 was better, to prevent Nf6.} Ndf6 17. Re1 {Nd2, Nf2, Be2 were all equally good. This is in keeping with white's aggressiveness, but with this move, white has forgotten about his g pawn being double attacked.} Qxg4+ 18. Qxg4 Nxg4 19. Bxe4 dxe4 {The e pawn is immune for the moment (...Bd5). My opponent would like to double attack it, and moving the king to chase away the black knight seems like a good plan, preventing a rook pin in the event of Rxe4 Bd5. But Nc3, Ng5 and Nd2 are somewhat better for white then Kg3.} 20. Kg3 Nf6 {And sadly here my opponent ran out of time. The position is complex! The e4 and h pawns will both fall, and with best play, black should have more winning chances than white. But if the minor pieces go, then this game would be rather drawish. A fun quick blitz game that I would have liked to see played further! Very interesting, those pawn storms. ;)}
