1. e4 {Hi everyone!  A couple of days ago I finished this game with another buddy of mine, Graham, who took part in the Annotations Project Part 2.  Graham is a Class C 1400+ player whose play is reminiscent of that of The Dentist.  He can play well for some parts of the game and has offered up a few good suggestions in the chat in our latest game.  Alas, one slip up in the opening for Graham cost him more than an arm and a leg!  After a double e pawn opening I decided to try The Centre Game.} e5 2. d4 {2. d4 - this move characterises the Centre Game.  The main line is PxP, 3. QxP and then the WQ usually moves to e3.} exd4 3. Nf3 {3. Nf3 - I try an unusual line here, it is a gambit.  This will bring about swift development at the cost of a pawn.  This turns out to be a delayed Danish Gambit which is a favourite of my Expert Buddy, Jim Friar (Therealjimfriar).} c5 4. c3 dxc3 5. Nxc3 {5. Nxc3 - so it does transpose into a Danish Gambit - black is a pawn up but all his pieces are on the back row whereas I have developed two knights.} b6 {5. ...... b6 - this move was identified by Gameknot as a mistake, viz:- Mistake: +2.36 » … b6 5. Bc4 Nf6 6. Ng5 d5 7. Nxd5 Be6 8. Bb5+ Nbd7 9. O-O Be7 10. Nxe6 fxe6 11. Nxf6+ Bxf6 12. Qh5+ g6 Best: +0.41 » … Nc6 5. Bc4 Nf6 6. e5 d5 7. Bb5 d4 8. exf6 dxc3 9. Qxd8+ Kxd8 10. Bxc6 bxc6 11. fxg7 Bxg7  5. .... Nc6 certainly looks better because it develops a piece, black still has all his pieces on the back row!} 6. Nd5 {6. Nd5 - this move looked good at the time but I think I am commiting a developmental sin here, do not move the same piece twice.  In this instance though, this move turned out to be a very good move.  Here is what Gameknot had to say about it.  Mistake: +0.37 » 6. Nd5 Nf6 7. Bc4 Nc6 8. Bf4 Nxd5 9. Qxd5 Qf6 10. Bg5 Qe6 11. Rd1 f6 12. Qxe6+ dxe6 Best: +2.36 » 6. Bc4 Nc6 7. Nb5 Rb8 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Bf4 Nf6 10. Nd6+ Kd8 11. Qxf7 Ra8 12. Qxe7+ Kxe7 13. Nxc8+ Rxc8} Nc6 {6. ..... Nc6 - at long last a piece is developed but according to the Gameknot line in the last note, the other knight should have come out to f6.} 7. Bf4 Nf6 {7. ...... Nf6?? - this move looked good just one move ago but now it is soooo baaad!  Graham overlooked a very serious threat.  Now, black must give up his queen to avoid copping Old Matey.  Here is what Gameknot had to say:- Blunder: +7.65 » … Nf6 7. Nc7+ Qxc7 8. Bxc7 Bb7 9. e5 Ne4 10. Bc4 Rc8 11. Bxf7+ Kxf7 12. Qxd7+ Ne7 13. e6+ Kg6 14. Ne5+ Kf5 15. g4+ Kf6 16. Nf7 Best: +1.09 » … d6 7. Qa4 Bd7 8. Bb5 Rc8 9. O-O Nb8 10. e5 Bxb5 11. Qxb5+ Qd7 12. Qxd7+ Kxd7 13. exd6 Kc6 14. Nc7 Bxd6   } 8. Nc7+ {8. Nc7+ - now, if black was to play Ke7 here, would he merely lose his rook?  Here is a little teaser for you!  The hint is in my last note.} Qxc7 9. Bxc7 Be7 {9. ...... Be7 - a developing move paving the way for castling, but Bb7 was suggested here.  However with the material deficit so huge it can only be a matter of time for me to convert it!} 10. Bb5 O-O 11. Bxc6 dxc6 {11. ...... dxc6 - a B for N trade to try and whittle down into an ending where I can force checkmate with K and Q against K.  I am still, however looking out to try and nail Graham a little bit earlier than that if I can help it.} 12. e5 Nd5 {12. ..... Nd5 - a good move here, it shuts Glenda out for a while and it threatens Fou Lenoir.  However I take the opportunity to exchange another set of pieces.} 13. Bd6 Ba6 {13. ...... Ba6 - but first comes this move which Gameknot gave considerable censure to:-Mistake: +7.32 » … Ba6 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Qa4 Bb5 15. Qe4 Rad8 16. Rd1 Rxd1+ 17. Kxd1 Rd8+ 18. Kc1 a6 19. Rd1 Rxd1+ 20. Kxd1 Nd5 21. Kc2 Best: +6.04 » … Bxd6 13. exd6 Re8+ 14. Kf1 Ba6+ 15. Kg1 Red8 16. Ng5 h6 17. Ne4 f5 18. Ng3 g6 19. Qa4 Bb5 20. Qh4 Rxd6 21. Qxh6  Although even with the best move white still has a winning advantage.  Just shows how massive the blunder was on black's 7th move! } 14. Bxe7 Nxe7 15. Qd6 {15. Qd6 - Glenda immediately siezes the opportunity to bravely get on her broomstick and fly into the enemy camp.  It will not be as easy as it looks to eject her though.  Black protects his knight with his KR.} Rfe8 16. O-O-O {16. 0-0-0 - Graham did suggest here that he would play this move.  He did suggest a couple of other alternatives which I had briefly considered but I thought it was best to move Henry off the e column.  Ideally I would have liked to have castled kingside but that was impossible due to the annoying bishop on a6.  Still, Henry is relatively safer on the c column because at least he has enemy pawn cover!  The enemy cannot take his own pawns!} h6 {16. ...... h6? this move was flagged by gameknot as a mistake:- +8.23 » … h6 16. e6 Bc4 17. exf7+ Bxf7 18. Rhe1 Nd5 19. a3 Rxe1 20. Rxe1 Nf6 21. Qxc6 Bd5 22. Qd6 Bxf3 23. gxf3 Best: +6.95 » … Bc4 16. a3 Bd5 17. Nh4 a5 18. Rhe1 c4 19. Re3 b5 20. f4 Rad8 21. Qc7 a4 22. f5 Kh8  White is STILL winning in the BEST line!} 17. e6 f6 18. Rhe1 c4 {18. ...... c4 - gameknot flagged it as another mistake.  I see Graham's intention, he intends to try and open up the c column and pound Henry with his rooks.  Here is what gameknot had to say. Mistake: +9.82 » … c4 18. Qc7 c3 19. Rd7 cxb2+ 20. Kxb2 Rac8 21. Rxe7 Rxc7 22. Rxe8+ Kh7 23. e7 Bd3 24. Rh8+ Kxh8 25. e8=Q+ Kh7 26. Nd4 c5 Best: +7.67 » … Bc4 18. b3 Bd5 19. Qf4 b5 20. Qc7 c4 21. bxc4 bxc4 22. Kc2 g6 23. Re3 a5 24. Nh4 a4.  Just note that white's winning advantage is increasing even with the Best reply. } 19. Qg3 c3 20. bxc3 b5 {20. ...... b5 - Graham continues with his plan to try and open the c column, but now it is time for my own rooks to nip that little idea in the bud and move in for the kill.} 21. Rd7 Nf5 22. Qg6 Bc8 {22. ..... Bc8?? - at the time all I could see was that Graham had cut the communication between his two rooks and that Glenda could snap it up with glee!  However, I had overlooked #7 as gameknot was about to tell me:- Blunder: +Mate(7) » … Bc8 22. Nh4 Bxd7 23. Nxf5 Re7 24. Nxe7+ Kh8 25. exd7 Rd8 26. Nf5 Rg8 27. d8=N Rxd8 28. Qxg7# Best: +15.55 » … Ne7 22. Qf7+ Kh8 23. Rxe7 Rg8 24. Rxa7 Rxa7 25. Qxa7 Bc8 26. Qb6 Kh7 27. Qxc6 g6 28. Nh4 g5 29. Qc7+ Kh8 30. Nf5.  At that point Graham told me he felt he was running out of options, he is right, just look at how big white's winning advantage is at the end of the Best analysis.} 23. Qxe8+ {23. Qxe8+ - I overlooked the mate as suggested in the above note but at least it is now only a matter of time before I do nail him!} Kh7 24. Rc7 {24. Rc7 - oh dear, yet another blunder, but at the time I was still pre-occupied with material stripping.  Here is gameknot's analysis:- Blunder: +21.21 » 24. Rc7 Rb8 25. Rxc8 Rxc8 26. Qxc8 Ne7 27. Qd7 Nd5 28. e7 Nxe7 29. Rxe7 Kh8 30. Rxg7 Best: +28.00 » 24. Rd8 Bd7 25. Qg8+ Kg6 26. Rxa8 Bc8 27. Rxc8 Ne7 28. Qe8+ Kh7 29. Qxe7 a6 30. Qe8 a5 31. Qg8+ Kg6 32. Qf7+ Kh7 33. Rxc6} Nd6 {24. ..... Nd6 - the blunders are coming in quick succession and there are a few more to come before my ship finally comes in.  Blunder +25.72 » … Nd6 24. Qf8 Bd7 25. Qxa8 Be8 26. Rd1 Bh5 27. Rxd6 Bxf3 28. Qxa7 Kg6 29. Rxg7+ Kf5 30. gxf3 Best: +22.58 » … a5 24. e7 Nd6 25. Qd8 Bf5 26. Qxa8 Bg6 27. Rxc6 Ne8 28. Qxa5 Bd3 29. Kd2 Bc4 } 25. Qxc6 {25. Qxc6 - unbelievably this is a blunder, I mean a queen forking two pieces and it's a blunder, why?  Well, yet again I overlook a forced mate, this time in 9 moves! Blunder: +25.92 » 25. Qxc6 Bb7 26. Qxd6 b4 27. Qd3+ Kh8 28. e7 Re8 29. Qg6 Bd5 30. cxb4 a6 31. Qxe8+ Kh7 32. Nh4 Bxa2 Best: +Mate(9) » 25. Qe7 Bd7 26. exd7 Rd8 27. Qxd8 Kg6 28. Qf8 Nf7 29. Qxf7+ Kxf7 30. d8=Q+ Kg6 31. Qe8+ Kh7 32. Rxg7+ Kxg7 33. Re7# } Bxe6 {25. ...... Bxe6 - mate in 7 is still on thanks to this move:- Blunder: +Mate(7) » … Bxe6 25. Rxe6 Rd8 26. Rxd6 Rxd6 27. Qxd6 Kg6 28. Qg3+ Kf5 29. Nd4+ Ke4 30. Qe3+ Kd5 31. Qe6# Best: +25.92 » … Bb7 25. Qxd6 b4 26. Qd3+ Kh8 27. e7 Re8 28. Qg6 Bd5 29. Qxe8+ Kh7 30. cxb4 a6 31. Nh4 Bxa2 } 26. Qxa8 {26. Qxa8 - Goodness me, Glenda has done a lot of gorging on enemy pieces today.  If she is not careful she may be too heavy for her broomstick - maybe she should book a few sessions with Slimming World!  The good news there for Henry is that on the Original Plan, P(r)awns are Sin Free, provided they are NOT served in a Marie Rose sauce!} Bc4 27. Qxa7 h5 28. Rxg7+ {28. Rxg7+ - at last I see the Winning Post.  At this point Graham told me he was running out of options.  I then announced mate as follows:- "Hi Graham, I'm afraid you only have 2 options and they lead to your copping Old Matey, viz:- Variation A 28. Rxg7+ Kh8 29. Rh7+ Kg8 30. Qg7# Variation B 28. Rxg7+ Kh6 29. Rh7+ Kg6 30. Qg7+ Kf5 31. Nd4+ Kf4 32. g3# It is up to you but you do not have to play this out. Joanne"} Kh6 {28. ....... Kh6 - Graham decided to play out Variation B.  #5.} 29. Rh7+ Kg6 {29. ..... Kg6 - #4} 30. Qg7+ Kf5 {30. ..... Kf5 - when I was analysing before I set up the conditional moves and made the dreaded announcement to Graham, I thought that I was trying to solve one of gameknot's daily puzzles, particularly when I noticed Nd4+!  It is now #3.} 31. Nd4+ {31. Nd4+ - there is now only one square available for the Bk and that is f4, and now my humble pawn on g2 advances just one square ........} Kf4 32. g3# {32. g3 MATE!! - ..... and delivers the Coup De Grace.  Hope you have had a good read of this - it is so nice to see pieces work together to deliver the final blow!  There are a few more annotations yet to come!}
