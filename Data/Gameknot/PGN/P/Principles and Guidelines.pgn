[Opening "King's gambit (C30)"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {Already, White is in violation of at least two 'principles'.  I've offered Black a free pawn, gratis and for nothing.  On top of that I have moved a pawn that does absolutely nothing to free White's pieces.  What's the story?  In common with other gambits, the King's Gambit gives away nothing for free.  What White gets - or hopes to get - in return is time, and more control of the centre than Black can obtain.   } Nc6 {Declining the gambit in probably the most 'principled' manner.  The classic King's Gambit Declined goes 2...Bc5, which, in developing the bishop, interdicts the dark squares in White's field.  A real nuisance, that, as 3.fxe5?? in response involves White in a whole heap of trouble after 3...Qh5ch!  Objectively best is simply to take the pawn.  To set against the given up pawn, White will need quite substantive advantages in time and activity.  The 19th century American Master, Pollock, I think it was, used to decline the King's Gambit with the knight move.} 3. Nc3 {Transposing into a Vienna Gambit set-up.  Probably not the best (3.Nf3 seems preferable, as putting more pressure on Black) but quite playable, all the same.  } a6 {[?]  Black clearly wants nothing whatever to do with the White f-pawn.  That's fair enough, but this pawn move does very little to progress Black.  It frees no pieces, nor develops any, nor does it add to Black's claim on the centre.  It does stop a White minor piece from landing on b5, but that is a very minor consideration that doesn't inconvenience White at all.  There are better things for White to do!} 4. Nf3 {Another piece deployed, and adding to White's claim on the centre.  I'm still unconcerned whether or not Black takes the f-pawn.  After 4...exf4?! 5.d4 would suit me very well.} d6 {[!] Now this pawn move is OK - probably Black's best available move in fact.  It consolidates the grip Black has on her share of the centre, and frees the light-square bishop (LSB).  True, it shuts in the other bishop, but it will be happy enough, defensively placed on e7.} 5. Bc4 {Developing, and striking at the f7-square.  White wants to step up the pressure on Black's game.  When White castles, the King's rook will at ance be ready to attack down the f-file.} Nf6 {[!?] In keeping with development.  However, I would probably have found ...Bg4 more inconvenient.  Even so, you will notice I made no effort to prevent such a move.  I could then immediately, or a little later, have hit the bishop by h2-h3, and asked the bishop whether it wanted to exchange itself for the knight, or go elsewhere...} 6. O-O b5 {[!?] Totally unexpected, this is one of those moves that can really disrupt one's programme.  The upsides for Black is that it's a forcing move: where is the c4-bishop to go?  It loses no time, therefore, and does go some way to Black's development by offering her LSB a choice of directions to go. It also has some - a little - impact on the centre. There are downsides, though.  It is Black's fourth pawn move, and the LSB doesn't really need the extra mobility.  The light squares in Black's Q-side might prove interesting for White, and Black really ought to be looking at mobilising her bishops.  This is not a bad move, but it had the psychological effect of encouraging an ill-advised follow-up by Black.} 7. Bb3 {Still focused on the f7-square.} b4 {[?] Now, short range, easily parried threats like are often criticised as being a waste of time.  But in fact they can be - and ought be - a means to an end.  Forcing as they are, they can help with seizing the initiative, or be the means by which one makes progress.  However, this Q-side expansion is rather premature, and ought to have waited upon the bishops being brought into the board.  Moves like 7...Bg4 or ...Be7 were much to be preferred.  Also good would have been 7...Na4 (!?), even though it moved a knight already moved, to the edge of the board, as it would pretty much have forced White to permit the exchange of his best piece. } 8. Nd5 {If one is forced to move a piece twice in the opening, let it be (if possible) to a more active square.  Black dare not exchange knights, because 8...Nxd5 9.Bxd5 10.Bd7 (say) ...Ng5 and White just about has a winning game already, with threats against f7 and the pin on the c6-knight.  Nor does 8...Nxe4 look healthy after 9.d4, and threats to open up the centre files for White's heavy pieces.   As it happens, 8.Ng5!? would gave been quite playable here.  After 8.Ng5 bxc3 (8....Bg4 is worth a look for Black) 9.Nxf7 cxd2 10.Qxd2 Qd7  11.Nxh8 White would have a big edge.} a5 {[?] Black is moving pieces to some purpose, but here the course taken is leading to a blind alley.  Development of her unmoved pieces has become a matter of extreme urgency, as will shortly be shown. Much better would have been 8...Be7, which is at least solid.  Even a move like 8...Bg4 (?) has now become too dangerous for Black: 8...Bg4 9.Nxf6ch Qxf6? [So parlous has the situation become that ...gxf6 is actually safer, here] 10.Bd5 Bd7 11.fxe4 dxe4  12.d4 with enormous pressure in the centre (12...exd4? 13.Ng5).} 9. Nxf6+ {[?]  Not the best!  The plan here was to open up the f-file for the rook, and thereby bring a crossfire from the bishop and rook onto f7.  In fact White has overlooked a much stronger move: 9.Ng5!  The line is fairly complicated, so I'll just give a sample: 9.Ng5 Be6  10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Ba4 ... (Also winning is 11.Nxf6ch) 11...exd5 12.Bxc6ch Ke7  13.exd5! ... (much stronger than grabbing the rook, on account of all the lines being opened up!) 13...Ra6 14.fxe5 dxe5 15.Qe2 ...  } Qxf6 {Safer would have been 9...gxf6, when White still have had the work to do to crack open the centre.} 10. fxe5 {Probably even stronger was 10.Bd5.  White has exactly the opposite problem from Black's here.  Thrown onto the defensive, Black has to play accurately to survive.  White is spoilt for choice, with several plausible ways to proceed.  He doesn't always pick the best!} Nxe5 {No better was 10...dxe5 11.Nd4! Qd6  12.Nxc6 Qxc6 13.Bxf7ch Kd8  14.d4 ... with a powerful attack against the King stuck in the centre of the board.  The sapient reader will have observed that White is in no all fired hurry (now) to complete his own development.  The reason is simple.  Right now White has ample resources to mount an attack sufficient to gain a decisive advantage.  To spend time completing White's development now, would enable Black to push hers along as well, and an opportunity might well be lost.  Principles and guidelines are all very well, but always they must be applied according to what is actually happening on the board.} 11. Nxe5 {Opening up the file.  Now the bishop and rook both are aiming at f7.  Black's response is, of course, forced.} Qxe5 12. d4 {A useful intermezzo, or 'zwischenzug'.  The Queen has to move again, the DSB is freed to move, and White STILL can play BxPch next move.} Qb5 {Black's best defence, by the look.  Black had but one other square available for the Queen, but that would have invited this horror: 12...Qe7  13.Rxf7! Qd8  14.Qh5! g6  15.Qd5 Ra6  16.Rg7!! ... To stop the mate Black would at least have had to give up her queen.} 13. Bxf7+ {You will note here that White takes with the bishop, yet after 12...Qe7, the rook capture would have been chosen.  One should always be on the lookout for little tweaks like this.  The King is being forced to move, which leaves him stranded in the middle of the board.  And to demonstrate the point that changing circumstances place different values on time, space and material considerations, White had a much better move than this check: 13.a4! This move is a bit harder to find, and its purpose a little obscure (force the Queen back, OR activate the rook after 13...bxa3 e.p.).  In fact I looked at the a4-move only in the context of a possible King hunt in the near future.} Kd8 14. Bd5 {14.a4 was still good.  But the course of play chosen by White is still good enough to win.  } c6 {Another good defence.  In a desperate situation, Black is hanging on.} 15. Bg5+ {Had I looked further ahead into this line, I might have played 15.c4 before this.} Ke8 {[?] I was expecting the tougher 15...Kc7 16.Rf7ch, with a King hunt.} 16. Bf7+ {Much, much better was 16.Qh5ch!  The bad part was that I looked at this move, too, but failed to pursue the line far enough: 16.Qh5 g6  17.Rxf8ch!! Rxf8  18.Qxh7 ... Having got this far, I ought to have seen this position was dead winning for White, but the apparently 'unforcing' nature of the position dissuaded me from exploring Black's real options at this point.  I barely glanced at it.  Silly me.} Kd7 17. Be6+ {A kind of a trappy move, offering the bishop in this way.  But I was really looking to the King hunt that ought to have followed.  Also strong was 17.e5, which move I also spent a lot of time looking at.  The reason for choosing the text was a certain special feature.} Kxe6 {That feature was this.  I always recommend to learning players: 'Never trust your opponent'.  If you see what looks like a blunder, you can suppose that it is, but make no such assumption.  Equally: you can suppose the apparent blunder disguises something sneakily nasty.  But do not assume so.  I am reminded of an old US acquaintance (TS) domiciled in my own country telling me about his victory over a Grandmaster - Larry Evans, I think it was, or it might have been Sammy Reshevsky.  At about move 9, the Great Man left a piece 'en prise'.  Our friend, TS, simply could not, for the life of him, figure out the plot.  What dastardly scheme did the GM have in mind?  So TS simply took the piece.  'I guess we'll find out now,' he thought.  He found out, all right!  Having made a simple blunder, the GM promptly resigned.  It happens to us all.  With GMs, it is a rarity, but not at all unknown.   Here, Black had to play 17...Kc7 though the following King hunt ought eventually to have cornered him: 18.Rf5 ... (I was actually thinking of the immediate Rf7ch, but this finesse is more decisive) 18...Qa7  19.Rf7ch ... [A] 19...Kb6 20.Bd8ch Kg5  21.Qd3ch Ka4 22.Bb3# or [B] 19...Kb8! 20.Qg4 Qc4!  21.d5!? Qc5ch   22.Kh1 Ra7 23.Rxa7 Qxa7  24.Bxc8 ... wins.} 18. Qg4+ {The King has no moves.} Qf5 19. Qxf5# {None of Black's rooks and bishops moved, and as such were not able to lend assistance to their beleaguered King.}
