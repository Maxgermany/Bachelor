1. d4 {the fist 6 moves are classic stonewall opening against kingog modern defense (?)} Nf6 2. e3 g6 3. Bd3 Bg7 4. f4 d5 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O e6 {here we are, every body seems ready for fight !} 7. b4 {strange move you will think. for sure, i was projeting to make a pawn attack to the black king side, so i didnt wanted the oponent to break my wall onthe queen side.  maybe not the best stretegy, but this is just free blitz game, good time to experimentations ...so this b' is to block any kind of c5} Nc6 {easy move,, but developping} 8. c3 {then i'm reaching my goal, to consolid the wall before pawn attack to the black castle} Ne7 {was is he doing there ?? i will see it after} 9. Nbd2 Nf5 {i still did saw the attack....so i go on developing} 10. Qe1 Ng4 {now it s clear! e3 is the target. but not very dangerous} 11. Nb3 {that s all ! } b6 {he is ot just blocking knight c5, but preparing Ba6 for after} 12. a4 {so i prepare the response ...b5} a5 {ok, that s good for me, it will close the a6/f1 diagonal} 13. b5 Bd7 {for a moment at least ! } 14. h3 {time to attack } Nf6 15. g4 {out the knights !} Nd6 16. g5 {blocking g6 for after advancing h3 ...} Nfe4 {bloody knight} 17. Bxe4 Nxe4 {he is not going to stay there for long} 18. Bb2 {preparing Nd2} c6 19. Nbd2 Nxd2 20. Qxd2 {so now i'm going to loos,  a pawn and have a hole on queeen side, bad time} cxb5 21. axb5 Bxb5 {here we are whith a problematic attack to my poor rook, i will take the opotunity to move this rook to the h colon} 22. Rf2 Qd6 {wy this queen there ?} 23. Ba3 {so i win the rook ! was very easy} Qc6 24. Bxf8 Bxf8 25. Ne5 {advancing the knight} Qd6 26. h4 {attacking the castle, now black should calculate before going on ...} a4 {ho no, this attack will be to long for black, they will miss time for sure!} 27. Rh2 a3 28. Ng4 {mate in 5} Bc4 {another time lost} 29. h5 Ra5 {another time lost !} 30. Nf6+ {mate in 3} Kh8 31. hxg6 fxg6 {the true was that the mate was there and i didnt see it first, i was planing to take the g6 pawn with the qeen, then mate. But Rh7 was mate right now ! nice, isnt it ?} 32. Qc2 {first plan, ...} a2 {ho no, this pawn attack is just out of game ! he didnt not saw the mate, Ra7 whould stop it !} 33. Rxh7# {strange to mate with a knight and a rook when we still have a queen, so we dont see the possibility, invisible move, psychologic invisibility.}
