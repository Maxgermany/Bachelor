1. e4 {Additional Annotation on end of the game starting with move 17 for Black.} d6 2. d4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Be3 a6 5. h4 Nf6 6. f3 b5 7. Qd2 Nbd7 8. g4 {I would have preferred 8.Nh3-f4 as White.} h6 9. O-O-O Nb6 10. Qg2 {I do not like this move since the Q is misplaced on this square. Simply developing with 10.Bd3 and 11.Nh3 looks better leaving White with a slight edge.} h5 11. g5 Nfd7 {The position is now slightly in Black's favor. } 12. Bd3 {Ugly as it is, 12.a3 (stopping b4) was probably best.} b4 13. Nb1 {This move is the one which gets Black into real trouble. Better was Nce2.} c5 {Black now has a significant advantage, but all is not yet lost for White who should now play 14.Qf2 Qc7 15.c3 to stunt the B on g7.} 14. d5 {This, however, loses material and with it the game.} Na4 15. b3 Nb2 16. Rd2 Qa5 17. Ne2 Qxa2 {For some reason the annotation capabilities of GameKnot would not let me annotate the remaining moves of the game - so here is what I would have said....Remember, White is already lost in this position with best play by Black.  18.Nf4 c4! 19.bxc4 (19.Bxc4 Nxc4 20.bxc4 Qb2+ 21.Kd1 Qxb1+ 22.Ke2 Qa2 would have held out longer perhaps, but is still losing.) 19...Bc3 (not so much to win the R as to keep with White K from escaping at d2). 20.Nxc2??? loses instantly (see below for alternatives) bxc3 21.Resigns since the next move is Qa1 mate.  I had expected 20.c5 Ne5 21.c6 Nbc4 22.Bxc4 Nxc4 23.Rd3 Qb2+ 24.Kd1 Nxe3+ 25.Rxe3 Qxb1+ 26.Ke2 Qxc2+ 27.Kf1 Qd1+ 28.Kf2 Qd2+ 29.Re2 Qxf4 when Black wins easily with his 2 extra bishops and Q-side passed pawns.}
