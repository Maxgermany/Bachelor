1. e4 {I am playing in this thematic tournament, the opening is King Gambit Decline, Mafia Defense. I never heard this variation, new experiences!} e5 2. f4 c5 {The variation in question} 3. Nf3 {I was thinking in 3 Qf3, attacking d5 (weak square). But I choice for this game make a normal development.} exf4 {This capture is not consecuent with 2 ... c5, controlling d4-square. Now, White has a KGA where c5 is a weakness!} 4. Bc4 h6 5. O-O d6 {I was expected g5, where I wished play a Muzio-like style} 6. d3 {slow development. May be, White must play d4 and d6 is an exposed weakness} Nf6 7. Bxf4 Be7 8. Nc3 O-O {I like the white position. Now, White has objetives in the kingside and can cramp the queenside whit 9 a4, and, later, a5. Black has alternatives; black can play Na6 and Bd7, for example, or open the center with Ne8 and f5. I choice attack the kingside (h6, specifically) with Qd2, but Qe1 and Qg3 is another idea.} 9. Qd2 Nbd7 {Unexpected. I  think Kh7 is a better choice} 10. Bxh6 {if 10 ... gxh6 11 Qh6 (threating Ng5, Rf3) and will not possible Ng4 (Qg6+). I believe white has a winning position.} Nh7 {Ok, Black did believe in the attack and decline the bishop.} 11. Be3 {Sure, but, careless. Better ir 11. Bf4, seeing d6.} Bf6 {Black is a pawn down, now. If I played 11 Bf4, this move is not possible.} 12. Rab1 {Protecting b2 for Ne2,c3,Ng3} Ne5 {Freeing the LSB, and place in a better position  a piece (e5). It`s true. But, this move allows a exchange and do not give attack for black (12 Nxe5 Bxe5 14 Nd5 Qh4 15 Bf4)} 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14. Nd5 b5 {This move was unexpected for me.} 15. Bxb5 {But, no fear, white is two pawn up, now. If Black want pick up the b-pawn (the continuation) misplaced a piece, else, do not sense the sacrifice.} Rb8 16. Bc4 Rxb2 {If 16 ... Bc3 17 c3 and white gains the piece.} 17. Rxb2 Bxb2 18. c3 Ba3 {Only move.} 19. Qd1 {But, now, for keep the bishop (white threat Qa4), black need misplaced the queen. Now, white has attack in the kingside } Qa5 20. Ne7+ Kh8 21. Qh5 {Now, I do not see defense for black.} Qxc3 22. Ng6+ fxg6 {Bad move, really, but 22 ... Kg8 23 Nxg8. Now, black can not recapture, if 23... Nxg8 24 Bxf7++, else 23... Kxg8 24 Qxf7++. } 23. Rxf8# {}
