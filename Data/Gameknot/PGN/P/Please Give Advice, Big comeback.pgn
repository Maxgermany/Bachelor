1. g4 e5 {In this game, I am black.  My Opponent isn't very good and I know a fair amount of chess, so I have a clear advantage in that department.  I still make dumb mistakes and don't see everything though, so I am putting this game up so that I can get some advice.  Also I make a pretty huge blunder and come back successfully due to my opponent making many mistakes.  Any pointers will help, so please comment.} 2. Bg2 Nf6 {I am going a standard opening while my weaker opponent goes a more... unorthodox route.} 3. g5 Ng4 {I overdevelop my knight here, which causes me to soon lose it.} 4. h3 d5 {I need to defend my knight somehow, and I personally thought this move gives me more center control than f5 or h5.  Also I didn't want to weaken my kingside since I was planning on castling there.} 5. hxg4 Bxg4 {This exchange was not optimal, and against a stronger player I may have been lost right here, but I have more central control while my opponent has made no attempt at developing his pieces at all.} 6. f3 Bc8 7. Nc3 d4 8. Na4 b6 {in hindsight, b5 may have been better, but pawn play is one of my weakest points in chess and I don't see how this is a bad move.} 9. c3 Bd7 10. c4 b5 11. cxb5 Bxb5 12. Nc5 Bxc5 {My opponent didn't have to move his knight, but it sure does help me.} 13. e3 O-O {A quick analysis shows that, at this point, I am clearly winning.  I have more control of the center and queenside and most of my minor pieces are developed.  Also, My major pieces are beginning to develop as well.  Hindsight tells me that I should've played Nc6 first before castling or captured the lone pawn on g5, but I felt like playing it safe.} 14. Bh3 Qxg5 {I capture the pawn anyway since my opponent failed to defend it} 15. exd4 exd4 {His king is now wide open.  I get excited and start planning an attack.} 16. f4 Qxf4 17. a4 Bc6 18. Ne2 Bxh1 {This is my big blunder.  I was completely oblivious to the knight attacking my queen.  Moving the queen or playing Re8 would've been so much better.  However, I was still far ahead, and what good is it being a queen up if you don't have yours in an advantageous position.} 19. Nxf4 Re8+ 20. Kf1 d3 {Another mistake on my part, I don't know what I was thinking.  Advice on a better move here would help.} 21. Nxd3 Bd4 22. Nf4 Nc6 {I finally start taking advantage of my early game development by bringing out my major pieces sooner than he brings out his.} 23. Ra3 Bc5 24. Rc3 Bd4 25. Rc4 Re4 {I feel as if my play here wasn't optimal, more advice here please.} 26. Nd3 Rae8 {doubling my rooks to prepare for an attack, but another huge blunder ensues.} 27. Rxc6 Re4e1+ {... If only that knight wasn't there, this move would've been so much better.  My analysis missed the knight, so my plan was to capture the queen and rook for 2 rooks and end up even in material, but that isn't the case.} 28. Nxe1 Bxc6 {Even exchanges are terrible when you're losing.  I really need to pay more attention sometimes.} 29. b4 a6 30. Nc2 Ba7 {My opponent, while up in material, is not taking advantage of it.  His queen and black bishop have not moved since the start.  This game would have been completely different otherwise.} 31. d3 Re5 32. Bf4 Re7 {I quickly lose the momentum I just got back, but my opponents lack of development hurts him since he can't easily take advantage of it.} 33. Bc8 h6 {My opponent clearly is trying to focus on my queenside pawns, which I admit are very vulnerable.  I take advantage of it by developing my kingside pawns.  Once again, my pawn game isn't the best so I don't know if h6 was the best move for this.} 34. Bxa6 Re6 35. Bc4 Rf6 {My opponent falls for my pin, and I am soon going to win the bishop pair, an advantage which will prove decisive.} 36. Ke1 Rxf4 37. Ba6 Bxa4 38. Qa1 Bc6 {Should have captured the knight.} 39. Qc3 Rf6 40. d4 g5 {Now I start pushing my pawns forward mainly to get them promoted, but even if that fails I should be able to get into a more advantageous position than the one I'm in right now.} 41. b5 Bg2 42. Ne3 Be4 {My opponent really wants to get rid of my bishop pair.} 43. Qxc7 Bxd4 {trading away my queenside pawn, but now I need something else to defend against his passed pawn.  However, that pawn never comes into play because my opponent never uses it.} 44. Nd1 Kg7 {moving my king forward to protect against any counter play with his queen.} 45. b6 Bxb6 {We can't have that pawn promoting can we?} 46. Qc4 Bg6 47. Qb4 h5 {At this point my opponent is playing cat and mouse, but he should really be focusing on defending against my pawns.} 48. Nc3 Bf2+ {Applying pressure and hoping for the mistake that is Kf1 since the queen would then be won by ...Bc5.} 49. Kd1 {A better move, in my analysis, would've been Ke2 just to keep the king active.  All of his pieces are placed defensively right now when they should be attacking or stopping my pawns.} h4 50. Bb5 Bh5+ {Forcing the king even further away and preparing to defend the g pawn.} 51. Kc1 g4 52. Nd1 g3 {If he captures my bishop here my pawn promotes or his queen is lost.  Totally worth sacrificing the bishop pair.} 53. Qxh4 {My opponents best move in a while.  I really had to think about what I am going to do next, but the next move was actually pretty obvious after short analysis.} g2 {I threaten to promote my pawn, and by now it is unstoppable as the bishop is defending the queening square.} 54. Nxf2 {Of the two captures available, this is the worst.  Now, not only do I promote my pawn, but it also puts his king in check.  Qxh5 would still let me queen my pawn, but this move lets me get momentum as well.} g1=Q+ 55. Kb2 {Nd1 would have been better.  It is all downhill from here for my opponent.} Qxf2+ {Wins the exchange after 56. Qxf2 Rxf2+.  Victory is within my grasp.} 56. Kc3 {And this just makes it easier.  Even though he was already lost, this move by white is so much worse than Qxf2.  I have no idea what my opponent was thinking.} Qxh4 {And the rest is history.} 57. Bd7 Rf3+ 58. Kd2 Qh2+ 59. Ke1 Qg2 60. Bc6 Rf1# {Once again, I would like to ask for any advice on how I could improve my game, other than the obvious "don't lose your queen in the beginning" since I already know of that one.}
