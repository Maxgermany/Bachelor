1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 b6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. d4 Bb4 6. Ng5 {white threatens the weakest P on the board with either a R-Q fork, or a check from the B, preventing black from castling.} O-O 7. Bxf7+ {7.BxP?? white gains nothing from this ill-advised attack.} Rxf7 8. Nxf7 Kxf7 {white has traded a B and N for a R and P. even though the point counter deems the trade even, white is now down a piece, under-developed (the only active piece is currently pinned), and uncastled. Making matters even more worrisome for white is that black is already in the position of trading even pieces, further emphasizing white's trade.    And lastly, as an advisement against such a trade...with the amount of pawns still on the board, and the lack of open lanes, the Bs and Ns are more useful at this stage of the game than Rs. So white essentially traded away 2 good pieces for 1 bad piece.} 9. dxe5 Nxe5 10. O-O Bb7 {maybe better for black is 10....BxN 11.PxB ....this trade puts white further down while creating doubled pawns on the c-file.} 11. Bf4 d6 12. Bxe5 {white cannot afford to continue to trade like this.} dxe5 13. Nd5 Nxd5 14. exd5 Bxd5 15. Qh5+ Kg8 16. Qxe5 c6 {white prepares for the B pin.} 17. Rad1 {the pin arrives...} Bd6 {...and is deftly avoided.} 18. Qd4 Qg5 {black threatens mate.} 19. g3 Bc5 {this may have been white's goal...create open lanes for his Q and R, but the number of black defenders who are doubling as attackers is undoing white.} 20. Qf4 {for this trade offer white could have offered a more self-advantageous square, such as d2. offering the Q-trade here entices black to wreck white's K-side pawn structure with doubled f pawns.} Qxf4 21. gxf4 Rf8 {white has no way to protect the pawn island.} 22. Rfe1 Rxf4 23. Rd2 {white defends against BxPf+!} Rg4+ {with the 2 supporting Bs, black launches an attack.} 24. Kf1 Bg2+ 25. Ke2 Re4+ 26. Kd1 Bf3+ 27. Ree2 {this is white's only viable option, since if 27.Kc8 then 27....RxP+ 28.Rd1 RxP++} Bxe2+ 28. Rxe2 Rd4+ 29. Ke1 Rh4 30. Re6 Rxh2 31. Rxc6 Bxf2+ 32. Kf1 a5 33. Rc8+ Kf7 34. a4 Bc5 35. Rc7+ Kg6 36. Rc6+ Kg5 37. Rc7 g6 38. Rd7 h5 39. c3 Rxb2 {black is content to start picking off white's remaining pawns while forcing his own down the board.} 40. Rd5+ Kh6 41. Rd8 Ra2 42. Rh8+ Kg5 43. Rd8 Rxa4 {at this point, white resigned by running out of time.}
