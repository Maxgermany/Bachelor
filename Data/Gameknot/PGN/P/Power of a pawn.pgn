1. c4 {60'th GK Tournament.... techinically, my opponent won this game due to a timeout, but fortunately he let me reinstate the game} d5 2. e3 {I was fairly new to the English opening in this game, I'm not sure if this is the best move... my bishop protects my pawn, buu was 2.d3 better?} e5 {Black has a strong opening position here...} 3. Nc3 dxc4 4. Bxc4 {but he loses it almost immediately. He should not have traded - his pawn had protection from his queen, and could have even further protection with 3...Nf6} Bd6 5. Nf3 {bringing out both my knights and preparing to castle} Bg4 {this pin happens a lot to me in my games} 6. h3 {chasing the bishop away} Bxf3 7. Qxf3 {We trade pieces, and I now have the chance of a checkmate with Qxf7#} Nh6 {Nf6 may have been better... Black's knight has a better position on that square (and that position is what loses for Black later in the game)} 8. d4 {hoping to exchange pawns (8...exd4 9.exd4) and threaten Black's knight} O-O {no chance of checkmate now Black has castled... but attacking will still open a hole in Black's defences} 9. Ne4 {a fairly strong position for the knight} Bb4+ 10. Bd2 {blocks check and chases away the bishop} Nc6 {protecting the bishop} 11. Ng5 {? I was hoping to put pressure on the f7 pawn, but I forgot all about Black's queen! Better would have been 11. Bxb4 Nxb4 and this leaves White free to castle to free White's h1 bishop (why I didn't castle in this game? I have no idea!) } Qxg5 12. h4 {chasing away the queen} Qe7 13. g4 {plan to attack that knight! if White plays g5, the knight is lost, and I win back the piece I blundered away} Bxd2+ 14. Kxd2 {there goes my chance to castle} Qb4+ {Black keeps the pressure on White's king} 15. Kd1 {??} Qxc4 {should have moved Kd3 here} 16. g5 {nowhere for the knight to go!} Nb4 {dangerous move! if I didn't see the threat here and took the knight; 17.gxh6 Qc2+ 18.Ke1 Qxb2 19. Rd1 Qxa2 (or Nxa2) and White's kingside is destroyed!} 17. Rc1 {best move for white} Qd3+ 18. Ke1 {forced} exd4 {Can't take that pawn because of the pin on my queen... by all rights White has lost here} 19. gxh6 {! This is what wins the game for me... Black cannot capture the pawn because; 19... gxh6? 20. Rg1+ and then Black has to sacrifice his queen to avoid checkmate (20... Kg8 21.Qf6#) Black should have moved 19... Qg6, but it then gives White a chance to counterattack by attacking Black's kingside pawns, (though Black would still have an advantage)} g6 {?? even worse!!} 20. Qf6 {There is no escape for Black, unless he can check-mate before I can} Nc2+ {merely delaying the inevitabe} 21. Rxc2 dxe3 22. Qg7# {One of my more enjoyable games! :)}
