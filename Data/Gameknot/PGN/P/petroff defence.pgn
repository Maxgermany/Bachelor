1. e4 {probably the best game i ever played here on GK, yes i know i lost:)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  } e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 {Petroff defence! had to look that up because i never studied openings, which will be apparent to any one going through my games:)} d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Be2 Nc6 6. O-O d5 7. Bb5 Be7 {black prepares to castle.} 8. d3 {my plan here was to develop my dark squared Bishop while attacking the knight planing on exchanging my b5 Bishop for knight temporarily making his light Bishop weak though it has control of the c8 h3 diagonal, and he will have doubled pawns.} Nd6 {protects his knight, while attacking my bishop, i think the added benefit to this move is that he has a lot of options, because he will be able to bring it to either side of the board to coordinate an attack.} 9. Bxc6+ {my plan in motion.} bxc6 {no comment necessary.} 10. Ne5 {going after c6, while optimizing my knights power. knights are very strong in the center and as strong as a rook if they cant be exchanged by a minor piece, unfortunately for me eventually he will be able to drive my knight away.} Bd7 {protecting c6.} 11. Re1 {taking control of the e-file.} O-O {protecting his king.} 12. Bf4 {normally they say to open knights before bishop but here i didn't want to do that because i want my Knight on d2, why i don't remember but i think it seemed like a good idea at the time:)} Re8 {wants control of the center as well.} 13. Nd2 {i want to play Nb3 followed by Nc5 increasing pressure on c6 because the bishop would not be allowed to remain on d7.} Nf5 {preventing my plan, opens up the a3 f8 diagonal increasing the bishops power.} 14. Qh5 {new plan I'm actually aiming to put my queen on g5 adding pressure on the d7 bishop, though i probably should have played Qg5 first.} g6 {protects against Qxf7 .} 15. Qg4 {now I'm where i want to be, and my whole point to being here is if the night moves to d4 i win the bishop by 16. Qxd7, Qxd7 17. Nxd7, Nxc2 18.Bxc7 winning two pieces for a rook.} h5 {forcing me to move my queen again, this i why i should have played Qg5 first. then i would not have to worry about h5 right away and i could play another move instead of losing a tempo.} 16. Qh3 {keeping with my plan.} Bd6 {i can't believe i didn't think of him playing that! that must have escaped me because his Knight used to be there. this is why one should always be looking at the position in front of them instead of the one in their head.} 17. Ndf3 {protecting my Knight} Be6 {now when he moves the f5 knight i cannot take the bishop.} 18. Rac1 {its to late for me to try Nxc6 because he has Qf6 and i will ultimately have a much weaker end game. but after looking at this again maybe i should have tried c3?} Qf6 {this to me is a great move because he forcing me into a loosing end game.} 19. c4 {this move costs me a pawn.} Bb4 20. Bg5 {maybe i should have let him take the rook. by playing cxd5 though at that point he still has a better end game.} Qg7 {maintaining pressure on my knight and attacking my pawn on b2.} 21. Bd2 {by playing Bg5 this move is practically forced.} Nd4 22. Qg3 Nxf3+ 23. Nxf3 {forced unless i want to give up my bishop for free.} Bxd2 24. Nxd2 Qxb2 {this was i nice combination winning a pawn and having his queen on the deadly second rank!} 25. Nf3 {maybe i should have tried Nf1 instead.} Bg4 26. Qxc7 {trying to compensate for my pawn disadvantage.} Bxf3 {weakening  the pawn structure around my king.} 27. gxf3 Qd2 28. Red1 Qg5+ 29. Qg3 {usually its a good rule of thumb that if your being attacked to try to trade off some of the attackers.} Qf5 {he doesn't want to trade, which makes sense.} 30. cxd5 cxd5 31. d4 Re2 32. Rde1 {this move was no good i felt so pressured to trade that i end up forcing one that is to my disadvantage, i probably should have tried Kg2 instead.} Rae8 33. Rxe2 Rxe2 34. Rc7 {this move seamed good to me at the time, but i hadn't thought about this position long enough before moving.} Re1+ {the beginning of the end for me.} 35. Kg2 Qb1 36. Rc8+ {trying to delay the inevitable.} Kh7 37. Qf4 {this moves me into a forced mate, my best move here would have been Kh3 followed by Rg1 38. Kh4, Rxg3 39. Kxg3 there is no clear mate from this position. } Rg1+ 38. Kh3 {forced.} Qf1+ 39. Kh4 Qxf2+ {the only way to postpone the mate from here is to play 40. Qg3, Rxg3 41. hxg3, Qxf3 42. Rh8 , Kxh8 43. Kg5, Qf5  44. Kh6, f6 45. any move, Qg5#. } 40. Kh3 Qg2+ 41. Kh4 g5+ {to postpone mate from mate here i should have played 42. Kxh5 Qh3  43. Qh4, Qxh4#.} 42. Qxg5 Qxh2# {in closing i would say that my biggest mistake was bringing out my queen to early. my opponents strategy of having me keep my queen locked in on the king side was most effective, and lastly when one moves into a forced mate like i did, one should always make it take their opponent as many moves as possible, because you never know where your chess battles will take you. if i were playing in a blitz game or even a tournament those few extra moves may have turned a loss into a win on time!}
