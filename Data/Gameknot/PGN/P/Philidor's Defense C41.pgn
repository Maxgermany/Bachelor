1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {I agree with some things Fiercequeen has said in her annotations ( which I really appreciate ).  The first is that blitz is one of the truest forms of chess ( over the board is the other ) since there is no way to play with outside resources.  The second is that in blitz we don't play our best and it's not a measure of true strength - but it's still fun.  Black has selected a move which according to the database gives white a 57% chance of winning.  } 5. Nc3 c5 6. Nf3 {According to the data base chances for white and black are close to even now.  ( 49% to 47% ) } Bg4 7. Be2 Nc6 8. O-O Nf6 9. Bf4 {Expanding on the queen side for black might be useful here. But he continues to develop, castle and perhaps then expand(?).  I think b5 would be good as it threatens to play b4 and seriously disrupt white's position. White could reply with h3 and after Bh5 follow with Qd3 perhaps.} Bxf3 10. Bxf3 {Giving up the two bishops temporarily and making b5 less of a threat since the knight now has a retreat.  Was he thinking to prevent e5 and an exchange of queens?  I am not sure I understand the exchange. ( Help me out please. )} Ne5 {Now if white wants he can exchange queens but there is no point in a drawish line.  Black can now get the bishop for the knight if he wants but the knight is well placed for now.  } 11. Qe2 Be7 12. Rad1 {setting up a pin which he easily avoids.} Qc7 13. Rfe1 {Strengthening the king pawn and perhaps setting up Nd5 and some exchanges which might win a pawn on e5.} O-O 14. Bg5 h6 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 16. Nd5 Qd8 {White's knight is now well placed and the Queen is back on d8 - this was the only square from which to prevent the doubling of pawns on the f file and exposing the king but it will prove dangerous.} 17. Bh5 {White avoids 17. ..., Nxf3ch, QxN, 18. Bxb2 and tries to provoke 17. ..., g6 ( which might not work out well but after  17. ..., g6 18. Bf3, NxBch, 19. QxN, Bxb2, 20. e5, Bxe5, 21. Rxe5, dxe5, 22. Nf6ch wins the queen - so black can't take on e5.  White could also get the pawn back with 20. Rb1. )} Bg5 {Prevents f4.   White's play is on the king side so it's time to expand.} 18. g3 Ng6 {The threatened pawn fork means black must retreat the knight or the bishop.} 19. f4 Be7 20. Qg4 {White threatens to win a pawn on g6.  Kh7 might actually work out best, it gets the king out of the way of any checks on e6 and protects the g6 square.} Bf6 {Giving up the pawn on g6 and perhaps getting it back on b2.  But white has better.} 21. Bxg6 fxg6 22. e5 {Black must retreat the bishop to e7 and let white win the pawn.  ( Qe6 ch does Not win the bishop since Rf7 holds the Bishop - although there are a lot of possibilities here. )} dxe5 {Opening the d file means losing the bishop! } 23. fxe5 Be7 24. Nf6+ {The discovery wins the queen.} Bxf6 25. Rxd8 {Black resigns.  ( Please comment and rate )}
