[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed"]

1. e4 {King pawn opening.} c5 {Sicilian defense on reply} 2. Nc3 {Closed variation on second move Nc3.} g6 {I replied with g6 with my mind on dragon variation} 3. Nf3 {After his 3.Nf3 I replied Bg7} Bg7 {I like playing my bishops on B & G 7th ranks, but a lot of times my games go other way} 4. b3 {Saco replied with his own plan to move his bishop on one square diagonally...} Nf6 {I had idea in this case to capture pawn on e4 and if he takes it I will take bishop which he still have to put there.} 5. Bb2 {Bishop finally arrived to b2 and I could execute my plan to capture pawn with additional exchange for knight/bishop.} Nxe4 {I thought saco will take it and carry on with one pawn less on the board, but he surprised me with next move} 6. Bc4 {I didn't like that bishop there as during our hundreds of games of play in live games and finally on here as we don't live close to each other now, so I decided to mess up some pawn structure} Nxc3 7. dxc3 e6 {e6 move was to prevent any f7 trouble later in the game...} 8. O-O O-O {Quick castling on both sides resulted in open game} 9. Re1 Nc6 {Time to open some of my lower value pieces as I didnt want to push forward while I am not ready to do so.} 10. Qd6 {His queen aimed to capture my pawn on c5 and I could reply with b6, but still not able to move my bishop as I expected him to play Rad1.} Qe7 {Instead I offered queen exchange, which I think would favor my play behind pawns.} 11. Rad1 {As thought he replied with rook to d1 } Qxd6 {His queen play is almost always better than my queen play, so I exchanged it swiftly } 12. Rxd6 Rd8 {Rd8 was to push his rook back with my bishop on f8 in next move...} 13. Re4 {He replied with Re4, which was surprise to me as he intended to carry on to H file, but I had time to push my plan} Bf8 {He had to move it somewhere, but where?} 14. Rd3 {Now I was able to capture a piece which he probably over looked and missed.} d5 {Pawn on d5!} 15. Rh4 {As I thought and so far he played what I think he would in exception to those 2 bad moves losing material.} dxc4 {Naturally I took bishop} 16. Re3 {I thought he would take my rook, but that would eventually favor me. I had a chance to go down with check and block his knight and then move to b1 and a1 taking pawn in exchange, but I would open his bishop to c5. I wanted his C pawns to stay one behind another blocking his bishop.} Bg7 {I guess I had better moves to play, but since I have that lead I thought I can stabilise my game and open more pieces. } 17. Kf1 {King on its way to center, but how much into it? I think up to e1 to prevent any of my rook's advancing to 1st rank, but so far I have no plans to do so...} b6 {Logical move to me to open bishop on b7 and connect 2 rooks} 18. a3 {White played a3 desperate to open double pawns, but to me it look like impossible quest, yet I might be wrong} Rd1+ {I thought about Ba6 with forcing opponent's pawn on b4, but I hope he plays Ne1 to allow me to play Rb1 and lose yet another piece...} 19. Re1 {Rook exchange to speed up and use that extra piece...} Rxe1+ 20. Kxe1 Bb7 {As planned previously...} 21. Rxc4 {Saco finally took my pawn on c4 and we were going for more exchange as I didn't want to bother thinking on some mating possibilities where there none} Ne5 22. Nxe5 Bxe5 {Bxe5 Bishop took knight attacking h2, but g2 was tastier as it would split pawns. If saco allowed me to take h2, he would be able to attack it after g3 blocking my bishop.} 23. g3 {pawn g3 move was good to protect both g & h pawns} Rd8 {Logical move as I wanted to bring my rook into one and only open file} 24. f4 {white opened position attacking my bishop} Bf6 {Retreated one square and realized that white rook is unable to move anywhere really } 25. Bc1 Bd5 {Preparing to put last nail into rook's coffin } 26. Ra4 {Move to only available square} Bxc3+ 27. Ke2 {He couldnt move bishop to d2 as after exchange of bishops it would go as Bb3+... check from rook and in the same time bishop is attacking rook} a5 28. b4 {b4? bad move, but I am asking myself did he had any better solutions. In fact yes! Saco should resign this game, but he hanged out for few more moves} Bc6 {Saco didn't have any chance of saving rook, so he tried to get some pawns in the last hope} 29. bxa5 Bxa4 30. axb6 Bxc2 {With this move white cannot pass this bishops web and help his solitary bishop and b6 pawn} 31. Be3 c4 32. h4 h5 {32. h4 - h5 took final end to this game.} 33. b7 {Last hope for white to push his bishop to a7 and promote pawn resulting in rook exchange} Rb8 {Final move of the interesting game.}
