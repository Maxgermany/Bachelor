1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 c5 5. Nf3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Nc6 7. Bxf6 gxf6 8. Qh4 d4 {The starting position for all the games.} 9. Nb5 {My opponent removes the Knight from danger.} Bb4+ {I develop aggressively.} 10. Nd2 {White interposes.} f5 {I offer to trade Queens.} 11. g3 {White wants me to initiate the exchange.} Qxh4 {I do so...} 12. gxh4 {...and White completes the exchange. At this point, I should play ...B-R4 to prevent the Knight fork.} Rg8 {I overlook the fork, however...} 13. Nc7+ {...and White seizes the tactical opportunity.} Kd7 {Now at least White's Knight can't get back out via B7.} 14. Nxa8 {Oh well. I can win the Knight, so i'll only be down an Exchange. I'll fight on for a bit.} Kd6 {To clear a square for the B, so I can discover an attack on the Knight.} 15. Bg2 {This B is en prise, but I'm too intent on winning the Knight to notice immediately.} Bd7 {I follow up with my plan. The Knight is trapped.} 16. Rd1 {White guards his other Knight, presumably to castle without it falling to ...BxN.} Rxg2 {I capture the loose B, and as White can do nothing to stop me from winning the Knight as well, White resigns rather than play out an endgame down 2 pieces for a Rook.}
