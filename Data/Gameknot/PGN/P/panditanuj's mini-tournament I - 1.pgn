1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Bc4 {This opening is called the Schotch Gambit.  It is used by players like me who enjoy having a large attack.  The opening is sometimes considered reckless, as most attacking chances are because an oppenent doesn't know the opening and falls into one of its many traps.} Nf6 5. e5 Ne4 6. O-O d6 7. Bd5 Nc5 8. Bxc6+ bxc6 9. Qxd4 {I now have the advantage that I wanted when I played this in the opening.  I have the pawn back, and I have doubled up his c pawns.} Ne6 10. Qa4 d5 {This was a big blunder on Black's part.} 11. Qxc6+ Bd7 12. Qxd5 {Now, White is up 2 pawns, and holds a strong pawn in the center.} Bc5 13. Nc3 O-O 14. Rd1 {This move forces 14...Be8, which allows for White to liquidate the position to better his advantage.} Be8 15. Qxd8 Rxd8 16. Rxd8 Nxd8 {Now it is even more clear that white has the winning position.  He is up two pawns, and has both of his Knights active. Black's Rook is hemmed in, and his Knight is badly placed.  The Bishop pair isn't enough compensation for Black's postion and material disadvantage.} 17. Nd5 Bc6 18. c4 {I challange him to give up the Bishop pair, but he decides not to.} Ne6 19. b4 Bd4 {19...Bxd5? doesn't work. 20. exd5 Bxb4 21. dxe6 fxe6.  The smoke clears with White having the advantage.} 20. Ne7+ {I think this deserves an !! because it lets me trade off the Bishop pair, with me having the only Bishop left.} Kh8 21. Nxd4 Nxd4 22. Bb2 Nc2 {?? This helps me even more. He can't hold onto the Bishop in any case, but 22... Rd8 may have been better.} 23. Nxc6 Nxa1 24. Bxa1 Re8 25. b5 f6 26. Kf1 f5 27. Bd4 f4 28. Bxa7 Ra8 29. a4 Kg8 30. a5 {He can't stop my pawn from Queening without a Rook sac, but that leaves me with a Bishop, a Knight, and 2 future pass pawns. He resigns instead of hoping I would blunder.}
