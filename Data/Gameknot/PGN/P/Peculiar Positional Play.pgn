1. d4 {My opponent had the white pieces and he started with d4,} d5 {I responded with d5} 2. h3 {And now a quiet move: h3, I was not sure what my opponent had on his mind and I was expecting the usual c4: queen's gambit, or e3: Colle's system.} c5 {And so I ceased the initiative and played queen's gambit myself: c5,} 3. Nf3 {And after knight to f3 we have the queen's gambit declined, more precisely: the reversed queen's gambit declined.} Nc6 {The game continued knight to c6,} 4. e3 {e3,} Nf6 {knight to f6,} 5. b3 {b3,} e6 {e6} 6. Bb2 {bisshop to b2 and the game has transposed to (reversed) queen's Indian defense.} Bd6 {Bisshop to d6, and black is ready to castle king's side, but never did...} 7. Bb5 {Bisshop to b5, activating the bisshop, attacking the knight and also white is ready to castle king's side, but neither did white, which he might have regretted in the end...} Bd7 {Bisshop to d7; defending the knight,} 8. Ng5 {knight to g5, looking to harass his majesty, expecting black to castle king's side,} a6 {a6; kicking the bisshop, not a blunder, but neither a strong move, because queen was coming to b6 anyway.} 9. Bd3 {Bisshop retreats to b6, now bisshop and knight are aiming for h7,} Qb6 {queen to b6, pinning b3 and planning on c4 pawn push; winning space on the board.} 10. dxc5 {Pawn takes pawn, opening the diagonal for his dark squared bisshop,} Bxc5 {and black recaptured with bisshop, to line bisshop with queen, aiming at e3.} 11. Bxf6 {Bisshop takes knight on f6,} gxf6 {pawn takes bisshop,} 12. Nxh7 {and white is greedy, and captures another pawn on h7 with knight, but this opens another file for black,} f5 {f5, impeding the bisshop from defending the knight,} 13. Nf6+ {knight to f6; check, should I have castled after all? I have no regrets!} Ke7 {King to e7; kicking the knight and look at the pawn stucture; black controls all the light squares around the king and since white no longer has a dark squared bisshop it will be hard to jab at the king.} 14. Nh5 {The knight retreats to h5,} Rag8 {And black swings his rook from a to g8; black is now dominating both open files at the cost of one pawn. Would you rather play the white or the black pieces in this position?} 15. Nf4 {Knight to f4, moving the knight to a more central position.} Bxe3 {And now bisshop takes on e3! Stripping the king from its defenders while it's still in the cetre and white has no time to castle, because the poor knight on f4 is hanging.} 16. fxe3 {Pawn takes bisshop, what else?} Qxe3+ {Queen takes pawn; check,} 17. Ne2 {and ofcourse white plays the only obvious move,} Rxg2 {Rook takes pawn on g2; infiltration on the second rank! Black now has three pawns for the bisshop and white's position is very cramped whereas black has many attacking possibilities.} 18. Qd2 {White wants to exchange queens to reduce the pressure and hoping for a decent endgame. Now what would you play if you had the black pieces? It might not be the best move, but I thought that it was an interesting one,} Rxh3 {so I played rook takes on h3; material is now equal and rook is defending the queen. Can white now exchange his sleeping rook for black's active rook? Yes he can, but then rook to g1 would be checkmate straight away.} 19. Qxe3 {White wisely captures the queen,} Rxe3 {And queens are exchanged, and we're in an endgame, where white has a sleeping knight for three pass pawns...} 20. Nbc3 {Knight to c3; activating the knight,} d4 {pawn to d4; kicking the knight,} 21. Nd1 {knight to d1; kicking the rook,} Rf3 {rook to f3,} 22. Rg1 {Rook to g1; looking to exchange rooks,} Rh2 {rook to h2; declining the exchange,} 23. Ng3 {knight to g3; going out on adventure,} Nb4 {knight to b4; aiming at c2 and d3.} 24. Ne2 {knight back to e2; he forgot his wallet, also attacking d4,} Rxd3 {Rook takes bisshop on d3; temporary sacrifice, removing defender of c2.} 25. cxd3 {Pawn takes rook,} Nc2+ {and knight to c2; check, forking the rook.} 26. Kd2 {King to d2; chasing the knight, but of course can't keep up...} Nxa1 {Knight takes rook,} 27. Nb2 {knight to b2,} Nc2 {knight back to c2; reactivating, if king takes knight, then the knight on e2 is hanging.} 28. Nc4 {Knight to c4; centralising,} Bc6 {bisshop to c6; activating,} 29. Ne5 {knight to e5; attacking the bisshop,} Nb4 {Knight to b4; attacking the pawn} 30. Ke1 {king to e1; unpinning the knight,} Kf6 {king to f6; kicking the knight,} 31. Nxc6 {knight takes bisshop,} bxc6 {pawn takes knight,} 32. Nxd4 {knight takes pawn,} Nxd3+ {knight takes pawn; check,} 33. Kd1 {king to d1, the white king is now frozen; it can't move anymore...} e5 {Pawn to e5; kicking the knight, the passpawns can now freely roll up the board...} 34. Nxc6 {Knight takes on c6,} e4 {They see me rolling...} 35. Rf1 {Rook to f1; aiming at the f-pawns and the king,} e3 {pawn to e3; threatening pawn to e2; check, forking the rook, and imminent promotion ofcourse...} 36. Nd4 {Knight to d4; preventing pawn to e2 and threatening rook takes pawn f5; check. And he did prevent pawn to e2, but the rook never got to capture the pawn on f5... Moreover; white didn't get to play any move at all; because black made a move, and won the game...} Rd2# {Rook to d2; schach matt...}
