[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian opening. I used to play it a lot, but I loose some games where I couldn't find improvement so no longer plays it. } 2. exd5 Qxd5 {Main line, the other possibility is Nf6 with the so called Marshall gambit} 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 c6 6. Bc4 Bf5 7. Bd2 e6 {A very typical scandinavian position has been reached. White has a slight edge, (better development and more free game), but black position is still solid.} 8. Nd5 {From here I'm out of books, but this move is not a novelty, for sure. The bishop attack the queen,} Qd8 {who prepared it's retreat with c6 a while ago} 9. Nxf6+ {Or 9.Ne3} gxf6 {I was expecting 9...Qxf6, and intended 10.Bg5 with the idea Qd2 and Ne5 (or Nh4). This weaken the K-side, but open the g-column for the rook if white 0-0. Both side will probably need to 0-0-0.} 10. c3 {To reinforce d4 and free the queen from garding c2. Drawback, the d2 bishop  is trapped and the Q-side is weakened a bit.} Nd7 11. Nh4 {Stupid direct threat. 11.Qe2 or 11.Qb3 or Bf4 seems better.} Bg6 {A positional mystake in my opinion. 12...Be4 looks more promising, and after 13.Qe2 (say) either 13...f5 attacking the knight, or 13...Bd5 exchanging white good bishop.} 12. Qe2 {I decide to X-ray the K. No direct threat in mind, just to put some pressure.} Qc7 {A good place for trhe queen. Black is ready to castle} 13. f4 {Threaten 14.f5 while the e pawn is pined} f5 {I was expecting 13...0-0-0. Then it seems dangerous for white to open the game with 14.f5 at once, and after 14.0-0-0 Re8 black will finish its development. Here, I considered some quiet plan with ideas like 0-0-0, Bb3, c4, Bc3, Nf3, Rhf1, Rde1, but decided for some mess instead. } 14. Bxe6 {!?} fxe6 15. Qxe6+ Kd8 16. Nxg6 {May be 0-0-0 instead of taking the bad bishop is better. I decided to stick for material and tried to remove all pawns on K-side. } hxg6 17. Qxg6 {The most important point is the development here. both side are poorly developped, but white can castle both side and bring the rooks in, while black will need many mooves. Furthermore, white queen threaten Qf6+ Qxh8 if the knight move, and f5 is under attack. } Qa5 {Pretty good ! With 3 ideas:  - protect f5  - leave c7 to the king  - attack white king if 0-0-0} 18. c4 {May be 18.0-0 to bring a rook to e1 at once was better. Or 18.b4 followed by c4 to catch f5 anyway, but it is risky.} Bb4 {Simple and strong (and obvious but I missed it)} 19. O-O-O {I don't want my king to stay in the center after 19.BxB QxB+ with an open e-column for black rook, and b2 or c4 for black queen.} Bxd2+ {If 19...Kc7 I would have exchange the bishop and took f5.} 20. Rxd2 Kc7 {black prefer to finish development rather than going into complication with 20...Qxa2} 21. d5 {! I prefer to mess up rather than slow down with 21.b3 (not sure it is the best moove, but it's more interesting ^_^)} Qc5 {I don't like this moove. I was expecting 21... Qxa2, 22.Rhd1 and 22...Qxc4+ faced 23. Rc2 Qxf4+ Kb1 where white give back material for a fierce direct  king attack. 22.Qxf5 to counter 22...Qa1+ with 23.Qb1 is another possibility. May be black should have play Rad8 instead. Reader's ideas are welcome. ^_^} 22. dxc6 {Opening lines around the king } bxc6 {If 22...Qxc4+ 23.Rc2 Qxf4+ 24.Kb1 either the knight or the king is doomed. (if Nmove, Qg7+ followed by Qxb7+ or Rd1+)} 23. Rhd1 Rhd8 24. Qf7 {Sealed the N fate.} Qe3 {Pin the rook} 25. Kb1 Qe4+ 26. Ka1 Rab8 27. Rd2xd7+ {?! Too much of a hurry. 27.c5 ! would have jailed the king. I don't think there is any escape. Still, my move lead to a wining rook endgame.} Rxd7 28. Qxd7+ Kb6 29. c5+ Ka6 {Black does not take in view of 30.Qd6+ followed by 31.QxRb8} 30. Qd3+ {So I decided for the safiest (no perpetual check after the queen exchange)} Kb7 31. Qxe4 fxe4 32. Kb1 {The rook endgame with 3 connected pawns is easy to win, even with inaccuracy. } Ka6 33. g4 Rh8 34. Rd2 Rh4 35. Rg2 Kb5 36. f5 Kxc5 37. f6 Kd6 38. g5 Ke6 {Black could have try a trap. 38...Rf4 with the idea 39...e3 followed by 40...Rf1+, 41...Rf2+ 42 RxR exf2 and black win ! But 39. Kc1 or 39.g6 seems sufficient to win.} 39. g6 e3 40. g7 {And black resigned. Thanks for watching, coments are welcome.}
