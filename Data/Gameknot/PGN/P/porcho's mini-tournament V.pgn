1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nc6 3. c4 {This was the start of the themed mini tournament.} e6 {I rather like this more than playing Nf6!? Because if he captures on d5 and I recapture with the knight, not only do I not have very much central control, but he can gain a tempo by advancing his e pawn.} 4. a3 {?! Wasted move, as it does is prevents my DSB from going to b4, which wouldn't be a big problem for him.} Bd6 5. cxd5 exd5 {I'm not sure I liked that exchange for white. It did trade a side pawn for a center one, but it allows my to develop my LSB.} 6. Bd2 Bd7 {This seemed to be the natural spot to put it, does anyone have any opinions where I should have moved it?} 7. b4 {Maybe a little too early to do this. I'm not going to castle queenside now.} Nf6 8. b5 Ne7 {I think black is a little better now. Black has all his minor pieces out, white has one. Also,white has that b pawn strung out way ahead of the a pawn which is backward.} 9. Nc3 O-O {I castle. I am going to try to get my pieces more active, and press me opponent for not developing.} 10. f3 {This isn't a *Terrible* move as it takes away a nice outpost for me on e4, but I would class it as an inaccuracy because it's weakening and he could just take my knight with his should it decide to sit on e4.} Nf5 11. a4 {?! I'm not sure what he's doing with those queenside pawns, but he needs to develop.} Qe7 {Threatens to win his e pawn.} 12. Qb3 {Well... development but at the wrong time.} Nxe3 13. Bxe3 Qxe3+ {Wham! suddenly my queen appears looming over the WK} 14. Be2 Rfe8 {Adds more pressure} 15. Nh3 {?! It develops it but I can take it and split up his pawns at the same time. I think he should have waited for a better time to do this.} c5 {His knight's not really going anywhere, so I thought I'd play this first.} 16. Qc2 {?! allows me to win a pawn and remove a defender of the bishop.} cxd4 17. Kf1 {? He overlooks his knight in an attempt to get his king to safety.} Bxh3 {I can safely split his pawns before I take his knight.} 18. gxh3 dxc3 19. Rd1 Bc5 {Threatens checkmate} 20. Bd3 {Deals with it, but allows mate in two. } Qxf3+ 21. Qf2 Qxf2# {Checkmate! Please comment and rate.}
