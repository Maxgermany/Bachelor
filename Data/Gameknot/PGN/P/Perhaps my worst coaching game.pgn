1. d4 d6 2. Nf3 Nd7 3. e4 e5 {Philidor's Defense. } 4. Bc4 Be7 {?? - Let's call this an easter egg. I was adjusting pieces when he called "touch move." I can't recall if I said adjust or not, but I allow it. } 5. dxe5 {! - Someone was paying attention during my talk about opening blunders, and specifically, how to capitalize on them.} dxe5 6. Qd5 {! - Never underestimate the lower rated players. } Nh6 7. Bxh6 O-O {! - The only sequence that allows me to keep playing. Alternative: 6. Bb4+? c3 Qe7, but I felt I needed to get my king protected and fast. And I would rather give up the knight then my bishop. } 8. Bd2 {Guarding against Bb4!} c6 {Time to re-establish my credibility as many of my club members were literally laughing at my blunder.} 9. Qd3 {?! - Qa5 is preferable I think} b5 10. Bb3 Ba6 11. O-O {White completes development by castling.} c5 {?! - Testing if white is paying attention to the entire board. Qc7 is recommended.} 12. c4 {?! - Unexpected, but it was a unconventional response on my part. In hindsight, I really should have played Qc7?!.} b4 {!? - Limiting the squares of the dark-squared bishop and preventing the knight from coming to c3} 13. a3 {! - Counterattacking this piece.} Rb8 {? - Wasn't thinking clearly here. This move adds no protection whatsoever. So I'll call it a blunder on my part as well.} 14. axb4 Bc8 15. Rxa7 {My queenside is getting dismantled by my bad play in the opening. I let the lower rated take this one at this point. The game was still quite playable, but to be honest I was laughing at myself at this point. I congratulate Mr. Hernandez and promise him a rematch soon. I might even continue with this game at this position just to show that the game is still playable. Oh and if you're wondering why Mr. Hernandez's rating is so low? He had a bad tournament. He only won one game and drew one against some low rated players.}
