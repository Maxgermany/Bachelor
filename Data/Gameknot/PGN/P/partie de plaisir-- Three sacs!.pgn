[Opening "Grob's attack (A00)"]

1. g4 {I don't really know what "partie de plaisir" means... my opponent, pliko, chose the title.  Anyway, all I've got to say about this game (other than what I said in the title) is this: stick around.  There will be fireworks.  (?!) Grob's attack, also known as the Spike opening.  A very unusual opening, and I had yet to see it personally.  My guess is that White plans to fianchetto the bishop to at g2, and slash at any pawns I try to put up in the center.} e5 {1... d5 is a bit more obvious (attacking the spike), and I had a feeling that that was what my opponent was expecting.} 2. Bg2 h5 {I probably wouldn't have thought of this on my own; credit the database here.  The point is that it forces a weakening of the kingside pawn structure no matter what White does.} 3. e3 {Definitely better than 3. f3??, though maybe there's some merit to 3. Bf3.} hxg4 4. Qxg4 d5 {The Queen capture allows me to get a big center with gain of time.} 5. Qa4+ {Now the question becomes, what do I use to block the attack?} c6 {I chose the pawn for the reason that it could signal the start of a pawn chain that would severely curtail the power of White's bishop on the long diagonal.  5... Bd7 and 5... Nc6 seemed okay too, but I was a bit concerned for the safety of my d-pawn.} 6. Ne2 Na6 {My goal was to get this stallion to c5.  Yeah, I know, "knight on the rim...", but I wanted to keep the diagonal open for my light-squared bishop.} 7. d4 {Bah.  So much for Nc5.  I could close the position with 7... e5, but I felt that a closed position would make it that much harder to attack.} Bd6 {Defending the e-pawn.  My idea was to start poking around the kingside, or centralizing the bishop after an exchange between the center pawns.} 8. Bxd5 {(!)  Damn.  I completely forgot that 7... Bd6 removed the only defender of the d-pawn, since my f-pawn is pinned.} Bd7 {At the very least I can gain a lead in development and tempo.  White's bishop has to retreat, and his queen is prone to a discovered attack.} 9. Bg2 {I was tempted to play c5 immediately, but I couldn't see any real way to continue harassing the queen after Qb3.  Nor did I stand to gain my pawn back (9... c5 Qb3 cxd4 exd4 exd4 Nxd4).} Nf6 {So I decided instead to add to my lead in development.  I can always play f4 later if the opportunity arises.} 10. dxe5 {Time for bishop centralization.} Bxe5 11. c3 {(?!) Blocks the diagonal, but White is also restricting his queenside development... his dark-squared bishop can only go to d2, which would only give his knight the unappealing Na3.  And if the knight goes to d2, the poor bishop (not to mention the rook) is hemmed in.  Furthermore, with the bishop fianchettoed, the d3 square is looking awfully weak.} Nc5 {Time to get the knight off the rim.  Nd3  looks very appealing, but probably won't be possible after 12. Qc2.} 12. Qc2 {Not 12. Qd1, which would force a queen exchange and give me a wide-open d-file to play with.} Ng4 {(!?) It was with this move that I started to see the inkling of an initiative on White's kingside pawn formation.  There are a couple threats: I can win back my lost pawn with Nxh2 or Rxh2 (though I suppose I could have done that a move earlier), or I can seriously menace his majesty with Qh4.  (Edit: as Ion said, Qc7 is probably more solid.)} 13. h3 {The "putting the question" move.  Should I stay or should I go?} Nxf2 {There's no going back now.  I don't have a sequence really planned after Kxf2 Qh4 , but I can only hope my lead in development will see me through to the end.} 14. Kxf2 Qh4+ 15. Kf1 O-O-O {(!) A consolidation move-- I guess I deserve a ! for this.   It should prevent any disrupting attacks on my king, and it's got the added bonus of bringing my queen's rook directly to a VERY useful open file.} 16. Nd2 {White's best course of action is to try and catch up in development as quickly as possible, and/or exchange as many pieces as possible.  d2 is a decent outpost for the knight, as it locks down e4 and controls c4 as well.} Qf6+ {In any case, I've got to keep attacking and hope I hit on something before White consolidates himself.  I was hoping that White would respond with 17. Nf3?? (which allows for a beautiful Queen trap after Bf5!), 17. Bf3?? (same thing), or 17. Nf4 (Bxf4 exf4 Qxf4 , with a bunch of open files and a completely exposed king.} 17. Kg1 {Wisely for him (and sadly for me), instead of blocking, White sidesteps.} Bf5 {A sidestep here (to d1, the only choice) is not so appealing, however, as it concedes the outpost of d3 to my knight.  A piece block at e4 falls to Qg3.  No, there's really only one choice.} 18. e4 {There it is.  The upside is that it blocks and attacks my bishop.  The downside is that it deprives White of the opportunity to post a piece on e4.} Bg6 {I wanted to keep the pressure on the diagonal, but keep my kingside rook active.  In hindsight, this turned out to be a very important move.} 19. Nc4 {And there's the break, the butterfly that flaps its wings and causes the storm!  On the surface, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with White's move, but I was playing around with the chess analyzer, and I found a line that seemed almost too good to be true, but I couldn't find a refutation.  Can you spot it?} Nxe4 {(!!)} 20. Bxe4 {As White played this move, I realized, to my horror, that there WAS a refutation to the line I had thought of!  It involved a zwischenzug ("in-between" move) that was fairly tricky to spot (a queen check at g4), but it was still there, and it could still be played!  I had to avoid it.} Rxh3 {(!!) A third, irresistible sacrifice!    } 21. Rxh3 {Accepted.  How could he not?} Bxe4 {Come on, you know you want it...} 22. Qxe4 {Is it dirty to say that White has choked on my bishop?  Probably.} Rd1+ {Three pieces down... and yet, I've got a forced mate on the next move!  I would have loved to see it played out, but I couldn't contain my enthusiasm, and announced the mate.  (Isn't there a way to add moves to an annotation?)  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this annotation; please feel free to offer your feedback.  And finally, thanks so much to pliko for being my opponent.  I know it's tough to be on the wrong end of games like these, but let me tell you-- I'd trade a couple wins to get a chance to play in a game like this, regardless of the outcome.}
