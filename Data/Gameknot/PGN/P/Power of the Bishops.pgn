1. e4 {This game illustrates the power of the double bishops x-raying the opponent king's position. This is a sicilian opening game.} c5 {book} 2. Bc4 {book} d6 {book} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d3 e6 5. Bg5 Be7 6. a3 a6 7. Nge2 b5 8. Bb3 O-O 9. O-O Nc6 {This knight move seeks to eliminate the white bishop after 10...Nd4. I was anticipating White will not take Knight with Knight because after 11...cxd4, his Knight on c3 will be attacked and has to move, making him lose tempo.} 10. Ng3 Nd4 11. Ba2 Bb7 {This bishop is well-placed as will be shown later on in the game.} 12. f4 {White weakened the position of his king. Maybe he was thinking of a pawn storm on Black's castled position but he does not realize that the attack on his king is very imminent.} h6 {This move was make the with DSB decide to take or to retreat.} 13. Bxf6 {White opts to lose the bishop pair. } Bxf6 {Black has the advantage of the bishop pair which will be very strong later on.} 14. f5 {White has weakened his hold of the dark squares making Black's DSB more ominous.} Rc8 {...to support the c-pawn advance and to firmly place the LSB on a8} 15. Rb1 {i was thinking this was to support a b-pawn advance and to attacked blacks LSB indirectly} Ba8 {this leaves the a6 pawn hanging, fortunately, it has no attackers. more importantly this move protects the LSB very well} 16. Nce2 {White is preparing a pawn advance on the queen side. } Qb6 {supporting the queen side with the Queen.} 17. Nxd4 {White took the Knight as it had a very powerful outpost position, at the expense of losing time after 17...Bxd4+} Bxd4+ 18. Kh1 {..the only logical escape. and the Black LSB comes into serious play} c4 {the purpose here is to connect the Queen and the DSB} 19. c3 Be5 20. Nh5 {Perhaps White was concerned with exchanging his Knight for the DSB and having double pawns on the g-file. and he might have been planning to put his Queen on g4 threatening mate in 1. or he might have been thinking of moving his pawn to d4 which will greatly weaken black's position and/or eliminate Black's DSB at the expense of White's LSB biting on bricks.} Qe3 {..to protect against the threat of 21 Qg4 with 21...Qg5. This is also to support the DSB on 21...Bf4 if White goes 21 d4.} 21. dxc4 {opening up the game.} Qxe4 {this threatens mate in 1 buying time before ...bxc4} 22. Qf3 {White wants to exchange Queens perhaps after realizing that his king is in great danger, i.e., black's two bishops are eyeing on the last two pawns protecting his castled position and Black's Queen doing the direct attack with only the Black king protecting the two pawns.} Qh4 {Black does not have to exchange Queens. This again threatens a mate in 1 and attacks White's Queen.} 23. Qf4 {This move is just to avoid the mate. } Qxh5 {but Black does not have to take the Queen immediately. } 24. cxb5 {White is still concerned with his queenside pawn attack.. at any rate, there is not much he can do to protect his king. mate is imminent if he moves his Queen or any of the pawns protecting his king} Qh3 {going for the jugular.} 25. Rf3 Bxf3 26. gxf3 Bxf4 27. Kg1 Be3+ 28. Kh1 Qxf3# {I hope you liked the game. This gave me a new appreciation for the power of the bishop pair.}
