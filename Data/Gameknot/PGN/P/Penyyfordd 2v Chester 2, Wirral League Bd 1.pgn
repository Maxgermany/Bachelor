1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 {And carry on with my usual.} g6 3. Nc3 {Now is he going to play the Gruenfeld with 3....d5 or a King's Indian with Bg7} Bg7 4. e4 {King's Indian it is!} d6 5. f3 {And I continue with the Saemisch variation.} O-O 6. Be3 {We continue with the usual development.} Nc6 7. Nge2 {6....Nc6 is a more dymanic way of meeting White's set-up compared with the formations chosen in Charles Higgie vs. Kevin Short or Charles Higgie vs. Mike Williams (see previous annotations). Now I remember at University a player called Rod Newbury playing this against me. I was desparately thinking back to over 30 years ago! I had memories of playing d5 in this position and losing quickly, although now I see in the opening databases d5 is playable, although what I play here is more popular and has a higer ratings.} a6 8. Qd2 {Both a6 and Qd2 are the most popular moves in this position - although of course at the time I didn't know that.} Rb8 9. d5 {So I finally accept the challenge and advance. Nc1 is the most widely played move in this position, although white seems to have a host of choices here - Rb1, Rc1, h4 and a3 all scoring well on the database.} Ne5 10. Nd4 {This was the point, to move my knight to what I thought was a commanding square and so be able to develop my Bf1.} c5 11. Nc2 {I didn't want to open the b file for him and give some point to 8...Rb8. I saw later on the opening database that 11. dxc6 e.p. bxc6 12. Rb1 c5 13. Nc2 seems to be a good line for white.} Bd7 12. a4 {I wanted to deter him from playing b5. Afterwards I found that f4 had led to a win in Raghuram Balaji… (2043) vs. Venkat, Sundara… (2152). a5 had led to a draw in Petersen Wolfga… (2091) vs. Mueller Daniel (2260).} Nh5 13. Be2 {But that game had continued with 12...Ne8, 13. Be2 Nc7 etc. My opponent finds a more aggressive set up.} f5 14. f4 {I have a plan to double his pawns and get rid of my bad bishop on e2, whose movements are blocked by my own pawns. I am now going to compare my moves with the suggested moves of a computer. (This was done after the game obviously). The computer here recommends exf5 instead of f4} Ng4 15. Bxg4 {The computer again recommend exf5} fxg4 16. O-O {Now I quite liked this position. I thought the exchange had dragged his f pawn away from the centre and so had relived pressure on my centre. I had finally managed to castle, and got rid of my white squared bishop. The computer recommends g3 instead of 0-0} g3 17. h3 {I didn't want to open up my king's side position, I though h3 kept everything under control. The computer thinks Qd3 or hxg3 is better. It thinks Black is better in this position. What do you think dear reader?} Qc8 18. Ne1 {I didn't see much point to Qc8. He is never going to be able sac soundly on h3. So I decide to move my knight to a better square - d3 from where it will be protecting b2 and perhaps preparing to support e5. Computer prefers Qe2 or e5 and still thinks Black is better.} b5 19. cxb5 {So I decide not to open the b file. Computer also thinks this is the right move.} axb5 20. Nd3 {Computer prefers a5 to this.} b4 21. Nd1 {I decide to move back to d1 where it protects b2. Computer prefers Ne2} Nf6 22. e5 {Black decides to re-centralise his knight, attacking my e pawn which is hard to defend. In this position I found a sequence of moves which seems to relieve pressure on my position, so may the computer is right to suggest Qa6 instead. Computer agrees with e5, and still thinks Black is better.} Nxd5 23. Nxc5 {So if he takes my knight, I take his. Computer prefers exd6 first.} Nxe3 24. Nxd7 {So if now Nxf1, I have a queen check on d5, then I can take his rook, or so I thought. What we both missed, but the computer didn't was that after Nxf1, 25. Qd5+ e6! 26. Qxe6+ Rf7! and my knight on d7 is pinned so I can't take his rook on c8. This is why white should exchange pawns on d6 first.} Qxd7 25. Nxe3 {Now my knight is becoming active, I have managed to keep material equality. I am a bit surprised computer thinks black is slightly better. What do you think dear reader?} Bh6 26. Ng4 {Seems best to drive the bishop back again. Computer prefers Qd4} Bg7 27. Qd5+ {I have a plan to force his pawns to e6 and d5 where the pressure on my pawns on f4 and e5 has gone, and so his bishop is restricted and I have a lovely square on d4 for my knight. Computer prefers Qd3. I'm not convinced this is better.} e6 28. Qd2 {Computer prefers Qd3 still. It thinks the position is even.} h5 29. Ne3 {He has only driven the knight to a better square.} d5 30. Nc2 {So I play to move to d4. The computer agrees with me and thinks the position is even.} Qa7+ 31. Qd4 {I thought with queens off my advantages of a good knight and a passed a pawn would be easier to convert to a win. Computer prefers Nd4 or Kh1, after which white is slightly better.} Qxd4+ 32. Nxd4 {I thought the knight was great on this square, attacking e6 but also able to quickly move to the queen side to support the a pawn advance. Computer rates this as even.} Kf7 33. a5 {So passed pawn need to be pushed! Computer also likes Rf3.} Rfc8 34. a6 {I push again and the computer agrees!} Bf8 35. a7 {I push again, and the computer agrees! It thinks the position is even however.} Rba8 36. Ra6 {This is my big blunder! I thought this was good, attacking e6. I was expecting Re8 when Nb5 wins for me. Unfortunately I had missed something. Computer suggests Nb5 here, with equality.} Bc5 {oops! If Rd1 then Bxd4 and if Rxd4 then Rc1 mate. So I resigned. many thanks for viewing my game. Please leave a comment and rate my annotation! }
