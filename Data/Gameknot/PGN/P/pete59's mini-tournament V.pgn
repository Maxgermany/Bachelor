1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Bc4 Nxe4 {This was the opening position for this tournament. I never play 1...e5 as black, so I've never been in this position.} 5. Bxf7+ Kxf7 6. Nxe4 d5 7. Nfg5+ Kg8 8. c3 {This pawn move is so obviously wrong that the trap must work only with the unwary or in a blitz game in Washington Square Park. (If the d pawn takes the knight, Qb3 wins.)} h6 {But this seems to be a pretty easy refutation. White has two pieces en prise. I suppose Qh5 might keep up the pressure? But...?} 9. Nf3 {Or maybe white doesn't have a plan at all?} dxe4 10. Qb3+ {With the h-pawn luft, this check is impotent. } Kh7 11. Qc2 {The pin is easily broken.} Bf5 12. Ng1 Bc5 {The f2 pawn looks weak.} 13. f3 {Don't know that this protects the square, exactly.  Black is ahead and should trade pieces.} Qd3 {If white trades, the black pawn on d3 will be a nightmare for white.} 14. Qd1 {There is probably a better place for the queen, which takes away the white kings only legal move.} Rad8 {More pressure.} 15. fxe4 {The beginning of the end.} Qxe4+ 16. Kf1 Bh3 {Threatening mate.} 17. Nxh3 {An apparently free piece, and also prevents the loss of the rook if the g pawn had captured. } Rdf8+ {However.... } 18. Nf2 {It's always amazing to me that a player doesn't resign in this position. } Rxf2+ 19. Kg1 Rxd2+ 20. Kf1 Rxd1# {}
