1. f4 {the birds opening.....very few people play this against me and I kinda forgot how to play against this just a little bit. I should have play e5 instead.} d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Bf5 4. e3 e6 5. Bd3 Bxd3 6. Qxd3 {at this point of the game, I was just making normal development moves and looking out if there's any weakness on my opponent side.} c6 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. O-O Bd6 9. Bd2 O-O 10. Ng5 a6 11. Rf3 c5 12. Rh3 c4 13. Qe2 {In the next few moves your going to see why I had a very difficult time trying to plan an attack against my opponent. His knight on g5 is very annoying and I had to get it out of my side.} h6 14. Nf3 Bb4 15. Ne5 {I hate this knight being here more than on g5 because if I decide to take, which I never did the entire game, I would be making it easier on white to attack me. For example .......15. Nxe5 and then after 16. fxe5, white have a very strong kingside attack and could bring his rooks and Queen pretty fast into the game and I don't want that to happen.} Bxc3 16. Bxc3 Ne4 17. Qh5 Ndf6 18. Qf3 Nxc3 {I figure if I get rid of the bishop than things would look a little bit comfortable for me, put soon you will see that my opponent had a little plan going on.} 19. bxc3 Qa5 20. Qg3 Qxc3 21. Rf1 {Now some people might say"why didn't white take the pawn on h6? Black can't take back because he's pin down due to the Queen on c3" Well, obviously my opponent saw what would happen if he took on h6. .....21. Qxa1 check 22. Kf2 Ne4  check and now I'm attacking his Queen and King at the same time. } Kh7 22. Qf2 Ne4 23. Qh4 Nd2 24. Re1 Qa5 {Reason why I move my Queen back is because I had a funny thought in my mind that his queen wants to come visit my king side just a step further and of course I don't like no one coming into my house without asking me.} 25. Rd1 c3 26. Qe7 {wants to get rid of the f7 pawn } Qd8 27. Qxb7 Qc8 28. Qe7 Qe8 {at this point I wanted to trade and I will have a better game from there on.} 29. Qd6 Qb5 30. Qe7 {I give my opponent some credit for being so relentless on attacking my pawn on f7} Rae8 31. Qg5 Ne4 32. Qg4 Reb8 33. Qh5 Rb7 34. Ng4 {this is when I started to get nervious because I saw checkmate flash before my eyes. It took me more than an hour to look at all the possibilities after my next move. } Kg8 35. Nxh6+ gxh6 36. Qxh6 {At this point I almost resign but than I took another look at my position a further more and said"I'm no where near losing." If my rook wasn't on b7, I would have resign right on the spot. After playing f6, my fear of losing right away is all gone and I'm not worry about Rg3  because my knight would simply take it. Also, there's a reason why I like my knight on e4. JUST WATCH} f6 37. Rh4 Qe2 {there's no way I'm letting you check me. From here on I didn't see any good moves for white at all which made me happy. Any move other than moving the rook on d1 didn't mean nothing to me because he would slowly be losing. But here on I won't say no more. But I wan't you to enjoy the rest of the game and here is the reason why I said you would like my knight on e4. } 38. Rf1 Qxe3+ 39. Kh1 Nf2+ 40. Kg1 Nh3+ 41. Kh1 Qg1+ 42. Rxg1 Nf2# {}
