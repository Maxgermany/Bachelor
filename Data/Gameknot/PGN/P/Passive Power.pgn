1. e4 c6 2. d4 {Usual move - urges for the control of the centre.} d6 3. d5 e6 4. dxc6 bxc6 5. Nc3 {He develops his knight.} Be7 {Another sign of passiveness.} 6. Bc4 {6. Bc4 - people think that Bc4 is mainly for beginners and novices - I frequently play it.} e5 {My pawn takes a share in the centre.} 7. Be3 {Bd3 - again, quite common, and one of two squares to develop the DSB.} Nd7 {Another passive square for the knight.} 8. Nf3 {Trying to develop his knight to an active square.} Nb6 {This is the reason why I played my knight to d7 in the first place. Note that 9. Nxe5 dxe5 10. Qxd8 Bxd8 is more good than harm to me. If 9. Bxb6 axb6, I have an open file for my rook.} 9. b3 {A strange, stubborn move. If Nxc4, to recapture gives doubled pawns. However, after the recapture, there will be an open b-file for either of us to use, but there is no reason why I cannot place a rook on the b-file first. Also from a book - grab an open file as quickly as you can.} Nxc4 {So I take.} 10. bxc4 {He recaptures, and the b-file is open.} Be6 {However, I develop my bishop and attack the lonely isolated, doubled c-pawn.} 11. Qe2 {He defends it with his queen - not that now after Rab8, he cannot play Rb1 because my rook is defended and his now isn't.} Qc7 {A passive square for the queen, and to support the c-pawn.} 12. O-O {He castles, and after planning to play Rab1.} Nf6 {I develop my knight.} 13. Rab1 {As expected.} O-O {O-O - same as white, I try to play Rab8, snatching the open file from him.} 14. Rfd1 {But all is not as swift as it sounds - suddenly I feel pressure on the d-file. Perhaps 15. c4 maybe?} Rad8 {Ignoring the b-file, I defend the d6 pawn.} 15. c5 {15. c5? Even though I thought of it, why play this move? It breaks the d-file, but gives away the pawn: even 15. ... dxc5 16. Rxd8 Rxd8 bring no harm.} Qa5 {But I have other plans, eyeing the c-pawn and the loose knight on c3.} 16. Qd3 {Oh dear, a most inadequate way to defend the knight. } dxc5 {Now not only do I win the pawn, the queen has no safe square to go to which it can defend the knight. } 17. Qe2 {The queen returns to e2; I gain the knight, a tempo and the d-file.} Qxc3 {The knight is lost.} 18. Rd3 {This gives me no choice but to take. My queen is on an active square and I don't want to move it.} Rxd3 {So I take.} 19. cxd3 {The pawn recaptures; now all is looking a bit better for white, despite the fact that he is a knight and a pawn down; all his pawns are strong, save the a2 pawn, which is defended now by the queen on e2. His bishop is in an active position, and his rook controls the b-file, perhaps eyeing to come to b7! What could be better. Flip the position and see yourself as white, compared to black, who has three groups of isolated pawns, and all his pieces save queen on inactive squares. Yes, maybe I am a knight up, but positionally?} Rd8 {However, everything changes here. I develop my rook onto an active square, attacking the strong d-pawn.} 20. Rb7 {Cleverly thought of. The rook sweeps out onto b7: if Bd6, this blocks my attack on the d3 pawn, and Bf8 gives a bad bishop.} Bd6 {But Bd6 is better, and it gives the bishop a better square.} 21. Ne1 {Ne1? This move messes up White's 'what was a lovely position'. The d3 pawn is just about defended, and the knight looks ugly on e1. If a rook comes down to the back rank and pins the knight, disaster shall happen.} c4 {A great, sound move, in an attempt to get rid of the d3 pawn, and my doubled c-pawn. } 22. Bxa7 {Again, this ruins the position even more. Now the white pieces are in chunks; queen and knight on the back rank, doing nothing, and rook and bishop on the seventh rank, doing nothing: Not a pawn for a pawn - though this does leave the e4 pawn protect after the pawns are exchanged.} cxd3 {I exchange.} 23. Nxd3 {23. Nxd3? Actually, though it may seem like a good move, what is best is Qxd3; exchanging queens, and then Nxd3 after the queen swap - this loses a knight to Bc4.} Bc4 {The knight cannot be defended and is lost. } 24. Bb6 {My opponent tries to save the knight by counter-attacking, but it is no use,} Bxd3 {I take the knight and threaten the queen, ignoring the free rook on d8, providing that there is no check available. This also threatens Qc1+ where mate would soon follow.} 25. Qd1 {The only square in which to defend mate.} Re8 {My rook escapes.} 26. Ra7 {?? I can see into his mind - he intends to play Ra5 and perhaps get his rook into the 'game' - but this loses a bishop.} Rb8 {And the bishop cannot move since 27. ... Rb1! pins the queen. If, of course Bd3? then comes Rb1, 28. Bc1 Rxc1 and all is looking grim for white.} 27. Ba5 {Nice try, attacking my queen.} Qd4 {I am attacking his rook, but his queen is more important. Of course, white can wriggle - after my queen has moved, it is no longer covering the c1 square and so ...} 28. Bd2 {Bd2 ...} Rb1 {Rc1 ..} 29. Bc1 {And Bc1 - white is hanging on by his fingertips! Is there any chance to win? } Nxe4 {Threatening Qxf2+ - of course, I could have taken the rook, but the pressure is on for him anyway, so I decided to increase the pressure. I don't like being greedy. } 30. Qe1 {No doubt defending the f2 square, but that doesn't work.} Nxf2 {And the queen cannot take back, since Rxc1 is mate! The rook is still hanging. } 31. h3 {Leaving a hole for his king. But what about the rook? Poor, sweet rook ...} Qxa7 {Thanks for the free lunch - and you've still got the discovered check to worry about.} 32. Kh2 {Hiding in his cove. } e4+ {The e-pawn triumphs with a check.} 33. Kg1 {The king goes back - what a waste.} Nxh3+ {Nabbing a pawn with a double-discovered check.} 34. Kh1 {The only move. To be honest, is there anything black can do here? He could go Nf2, Ng3, Nf2 but he wants a win, not a draw! Is there any way to win this??} Be2 {!!! What! That's two pieces hanging! Surely not. Surely not. But yes, this is a fabulous move. Take a moment to admire this move. Here are the variations - there is no good move for white to make.  1. 35. Qxe2 Qg1# 2. 35. gxh3 Bf3#  I hope you spotted the first variation but did you see the second? Now, what could white possibly do? He can't take, so ...} 35. a3 {I know - odd isn't it - but if you were white, what could you do? The question is, Be2 hasn't got anywhere - it may have been a spectacular move but has it got us anywhere? No? So what could white possibly do now - a3 actually has a good use - it stops Bb3 ... that's a clue - what's coming next ...} Bg3 {Whoop whoop! Actually, this move is dead easy to spot, but it's a killer - the white queen is trapped. [Keep in mind that 36. gxh3 Bf3# is still mate] - this leaves white as stranded as ever - and of course, any move with the bishop leaves the obvious 37. ... Rxe1#. (Unless of course, 36. Be3 Rxe1+ 37. Bg1 Rxg1# but fussy people, that doesn't matter). So what is white to do.} 36. a4 {This is the best move - leaving the queen to be taken. Obviously with QXB comes Qg1#, but this slows it down, a bit. Anyhow, continuing...} Bxe1 {:( Sorry people, but that was just too much to offer - even I can't resist not taking the queen, but the game ends spectacularly, so don't be disappointed.} 37. Kh2 {Of course, the greedy 37. gxf3? fails to 37 ... Bf3+ 38. Kh2 Qf2# but this is no better, but it does have a better ending. Observe. } Qg1+ {Yep, the obvious. } 38. Kxh3 {Well, what else could be done, and now, with the help of those to strong bishops, here comes ...} Qh1# {Qh1# with an absolutely wonderful mate. Just look at it all. But the main motif of this annotation is that passiveness isn't always bad - I launched an absolutely ferocious attack at the end. Thanks for watching: please do make any comments necessary or ratings. Thank you! @oodle3 :D  (My opponent did play very well in this, but there you are.)}
