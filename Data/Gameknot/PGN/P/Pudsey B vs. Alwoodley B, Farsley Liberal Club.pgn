[Opening "French (C11), Steinitz, Bradford attack"]

1. e4 {I was very happy to see this as I've not had much chance to study as yet and I was more e4 than a d4 system or something. I have played the French for years so was expecting something that I know well. } e6 {The defence I've probably played more than any other. } 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {I was happy to see this over an exchange, which is something that I have previously refused to study. } Nf6 {Keeping it nice and simple, or so I thought, with the classical variation. I do like exciting chess but generally that's more with the white pieces. there's too much theory to learn in say the Winawer. Alternative variation: 3... Bb4 4. e5 Ne7 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. Qg4 [The Winawer is so much more complex although I may find time so study it someday.] } 4. e5 Nfd7 {The Steinitz Variation. } 5. Bd3 a6 {This is unnecessary, better and more accurate was 5...c5. The move Nb5 has often caused issues to I tend to throw in ...a6 as prophylaxis. In some lines this move is necessary to prevent Nb5 followed by Nd6 but you can generally just counter Nb5 with ...f6 anyway, undermining the d6 hole. Alternative variation: [Better was just ] 5... c5 [followed by] 6. f4 Nc6 7. Nf3 Nxd4 8. O-O Nxf3+ 9. Qxf3 } 6. f4 {All standard stuff so far. Immediately grabbing space on the Kingside. } c5 {Essentially I'm one move behind here and I should really be playing 6...Nc6 now, in which case, black would have a slight edge. I think the actual position is about equal. } 7. f5 {Ugh! This confused me, all the years of playing the French and I've never seen this. I knew it must be bad but practically every line I looked at seemed to be decent for white. I think Andy realised I'd been out of the game for some time and tried to mix it up a bit. I should be close to winning here but I miscalculated a little under the pressure of being watched and expected to perform. } c4 {This was an innacuracy on my part and should be losing by force however, my opponent wanted more than just a pawn. The reasoning behind this move was to force the light squared bishop off the b1-h7 diagonal, the lines involving fxe6, Qh5 and Bxg6 worried me. Let's discuss the alternatives and what made me choose this over the various other candidate moves; Alternative variation: [First I looked at] 7... Qh4+ [but after] 8. g3 Qxd4 9. Nf3 [I ruled this out for obvious reasons.] Alternative variation: [I then looked at]  7... exf5 8. Bxf5 Nc6 9. Nxd5 [which was okay but I didn't like the fact that my King was still in the centre, so I ruled this line out too.] Alternative variation: [I then miscalculated] 7... cxd4 [which (according to my engines) was the best move!] 8. fxe6 Nxe5 [This is the best reply and it's simply better for black now. There were so many tricky variations to look at so it was quite brutal for my first game back in over 10 months!] (8... fxe6 [I was worried about this line however, simply ...Nxe5 is better for black] 9. Qh5+ g6 10. Bxg6+) } 8. fxe6 {I expected 8.Be2 here, which is playable but white chose an even better move. White is certainly trying to keep the initiative alive. } cxd3 9. exf7+ {I can see why white plays this but better was Alternative variation: 9. exd7+ [when] Bxd7 10. Qxd3 Nc6 [ which is slightly better for white however, there's no clear counterplay in that line which is probably why white went for 9.exf7+. I need to defend precisely now.] } Kxf7 10. Qf3+ {So black may be a piece for a pawn up but white has compensation and the initiative. There's always chances for me to go wrong here, especially at OTB chess. } Ke8 {The best square for the King. It looks strange, especially considering that I can't castle but anything else is either dangerous or restrictive. There's actually no checks from e8 so this gives me chance to unravel somewhat. } 11. Nh3 {This just seems too slow. I can see that white wants to castle and get his Rook to f1 but he just doesn't get chance until it's too late. It's my turn to grab some initiative and confidence now. } Qh4+ {Black's King seems more exposed than mine which is ironic as he's the only one able to castle. } 12. Nf2 {Some use came of Nh3 after all! } Qxd4 {I seem to be maintaining some initiative and appear to be making it hard for white to find any resources. } 13. Nxd3 {I'm very confident with my position here. I have the initiative and I'm a whole piece up, my King may be stuck in the centre but white is unable to capitalise on this. } Nxe5 {Many people would be put off playing this, especially with the King being on e8 but this was fully calculated and I just knew black was winning now. After 14.Qh5+ I just have 14...Ng6 when after 15.Qxd5 I can force the exchange of Queen's and have an easier endgame. } 14. Qh5+ {Alternative variation: [If] 14. Qe2 [then] Nbc6 [holds after] 15. Bf4 Bg4 [And black is easily winning.] } Ng6 {I played this immediately, showing my opponent how confident I was at this stage. } 15. Qe2+ {Bit rash, forcing me to develop a piece? Thanks! } Be7 16. Be3 {Looks forcing but here I move out of a threat whilst leaving a threat of my own on d4. } Qc4 {Retaining the initiative as I'm now threatening the fork on d4. } 17. Kd2 {Game over, surely the only move was Bg5 here? Alternative variation: 17. Bg5 [was white's bes try but he's still losing.] Bg4 18. Qd2 Rf8 [with a good game for black.] } d4 {Not sure whether white missed this but he was losing anyway. Unless this was part of his last ditch plan to try and win my Queen? } 18. Ne4 {It's really not easy for white now, he can just resign immediately but I think he wanted to play on a little more as there is still potential for tactics in a messy position such as this one. My King is awkwardly placed and white probably thinks his pieces are better coordinated than mine, despite being two minor pieces down. } dxe3+ 19. Qxe3 {Of course white now threatens 20.Nd6+, due to the X-Ray attack by the white Queen which will pin the dark squared bishop to e7. I'm not in a rush so I'm looking out for all tactical threats before I move a piece. } Qc7 {Removing the threat on d6 and keeping an eye on f7. } 20. Raf1 {I was happy to see this, more pieces will come off soon. } Rf8 {My plan is just to exchange Rooks and get my King to safety. I thought as soon as that was accomplished, white would resign, knowing that he'd failed to find any saving resources. } 21. Rxf8+ Kxf8 22. Rf1+ {Forcing my King to a safer square. } Kg8 {A pair of Rooks traded and my King to safety, here I can breathe a sigh of relief. My first game of 2018 was looking great! } 23. Kc1 {I didn't understanf this move at all... } Nc6 {Quickly trying to free the Rook so that I can get another piece off the board. } 24. h3 {Feels like white is now thinking about resigning. } Bd7 {Now the Rook has been activated and my two bishops are controlling a lot of central squares. } 25. a3 {I feel like white is just making a few aimless moves so that it doesn't look too embarassing after resigning after so few moves. } Rf8 {Exchanging the final pair of Rooks which will leave my bishop pair even more dominant. } 26. Rxf8+ Bxf8 {And white resigned. Great result and it's nice to get off to a winning start after taking so long out of chess (2 matches in a 3 year period). It won't do my grade any harm either. The lesson to learn here is not to panic when faced with something unusual or rare, it's unusual for a reason, because it's bad! My opponent gave me a material advantage in return for the initiative. I rode the storm and came out fighting. The next game I'll be even stronger. }
