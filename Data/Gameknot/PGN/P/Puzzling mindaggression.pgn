[Opening "Bird's opening, Swiss gambit (A02)"]

1. f4 {Bird's opening, not my favorite, suggesting a weaker king's side...} f5 {Unconventionally stopping the white pawn advancing and keeping the e5 for later on} 2. Nf3 e6 {Protecting the f5 pawn and opening the queen & bishop's diagonals for attack on the black squares} 3. e3 {Same move on the other side...} d5 {Black aims at kind of Stonewall in the centre...} 4. a3 {Not really sure where this leads to...} Bd6 {Further supporting the centre. Although it might look as a waste of time at first, it could appear quite fundamental further. } 5. b3 {White is very slow...} h6 6. Be2 g5 {G Pawn advances strongly putting some pressure on the f pawn and weekening further the K side.} 7. Bb2 {Strong move by white occupying the a1 - h8 diagonal. Now I understand what those pawn moves earlier were aimed at:)} Rh7 {Rook hast to lift up and I do not really mind it.} 8. Ne5 {Quite useless attack in my oppinion at that point, but ok it oppens a diagonal for attack to the white King...} Nf6 {I have to protect these white squares...it might get dangerous...} 9. Ng6 {White opens his black diagonal and trys to put pressure on my Knight.} gxf4 {I disregard} 10. Bh5 {Lingering check on the black king with a open knight attacking move.} fxe3 {Black pawn captures escaping the white knight's attack and endangering further} 11. dxe3 {White recaptures.} Nbd7 {Supporting my knight and developing further} 12. Nf4+ {Check comes. I have to support that e6 pawn.} Ke7 13. Bg6 {Thanks for letting me develop even more...} Rg7 14. Bh5 {Wanna get out...ok} Qg8 {White king's side starts to look really vulnerable...} 15. Bf3 Ne5 {I need this white bishop out of there} 16. O-O {White castles against my strong g file! I cannot believe it, although there is still plenty work to do...} Neg4 {I decide to put pressure on white's e-pawn and get the centre...} 17. Qd4 {Strong move by the black having the Q ruling the centre and endangering this notorious black diagonal.} c5 {Here pawn xe5 also could be an option.} 18. Qc3 {Q retreats but still keeps the presure.} e5 {I'm trying to loose it a bit and starting a nice attack at the same time.} 19. Nd2 {Another very good developing move by white, but does he see my lingering attack options there...I guess...} Qf7 {Queen supports and looking for more weekness in black's defence ...} 20. Ne2 {The white knight is maybe scared...at the same time he keeps that pressure from the white Queen on the black squares diagonal } Nxh2 {However the Black attack starts slowly but surely sacraficing a good knight.} 21. Kxh2 {White king goes for it. he still doesn't feel much endangered.} d4 {Let's put some pressure on the Queen first. I need her out of there to develop my attack on the K's side.} 22. Qc4 {White Q moves offering exchange. I do not go for it.} e4+ {Check instead} 23. Kg1 {And white King hides back into his little hole...} Be6 {I need my Queen and at the same time here comes the second rook too.} 24. Qb5 {Now I have to take care of whites attack on the weakend black King's side and support the centre.} Bd5 {Here comes my white bishop.} 25. Bxe4 {White starts a kind of attack, but isn't it too late?} Nxe4 26. Nf3 {Trying to cover up?} Rxg2+ {Did white think of this? I don't think so:)} 27. Kxg2 {From here on is game over. Thanks for watching!} Rg8+ 28. Ng3 Rxg3+ {}
