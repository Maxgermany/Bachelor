1. e4 {This game features the Morra Gambit. It's not really popular at higher levels and perhaps for good reasons. It gives away a central pawn for two tempi and some open lines. White has some initiative but he has to be very creative or hope that Black will slip up and make his investment worthwhile.} c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 d6 {There are quite a few good ways to play against this gambit. Plans with e6 are also feasible but this suits my style better.} 6. Bc4 a6 {Black has to be careful here since 6...Nf6 could be met with 7.e5 posing some immediate problems.} 7. O-O Nf6 8. h3 {White stops Black's intended 8...Bg4 which could follow after the natural 8.Qe2. Now the Bishop has to stay inside the pawnchain.} e6 9. Bf4 {White's position looks very attractive but I don't think it justifies a full pawn. Black has no weaknesses and can plan slowly a counter-attack from behind his wall of infantry.} Be7 10. Qe2 O-O 11. Rfd1 Qc7 12. a3 b5 {Preparing to develop the Bishop on the long diagonal to exert pressure on e4.} 13. Ba2 Ne5 {Presenting White with the possibility to double my pawns. This isn't a real cause of concern as I will have an open file and very good central control. Exchanging a pair of Knights also means White will have fewer attacking chances.} 14. Rac1 Qb8 {The best place to put the Queen in the Morra gambit variation. It doesn't look very active but it controls d6 and e5 and aims to push the b-pawn.} 15. Nd4 {White didn't want to let me exchange the Knight and now threatens Bxe5 and Nc6.} Bb7 {Bringing the last piece into play and preventing a possible Nc6.} 16. Bxe5 {This unprovoked exchange give Black a serious edge. It was better to withdraw the Bishop so that the Ne5 could be kicked from his active spot with f4. } dxe5 17. Nf3 {Perhaps 17.Nb3 was better with the idea of Na5.} Rd8 {I'm still a pawn up so I try to exchange as many pieces as I can.} 18. Rxd8+ Bxd8 {The Queen has to cover e5. The Bishop wasn't very active on e7 anyway.} 19. Bb1 {Overprotecting e4.} Bb6 {Taking aim at f2 and delaying a possible f3 advance that could secure the e4 pawn.} 20. Rd1 Qc7 {Now that the c-file is clear the Queen can come to a more active square.} 21. Qd2 h6 {Preventing from any back rank threats. I think White missed his gambited pawn around here. His initiative is nonexistent and besides the extra pawn I have pressure on e4 and the Bishop pair. } 22. Rc1 Rc8 {No more running now.} 23. Ne2 Qd7 {Forcing more exchanges.} 24. Rxc8+ Bxc8 {Perhaps 24...Qxc8 was a little more accurate but I wanted to keep the Queen swap offer on the table.} 25. Qc1 Qc7 {Preparing a little trap that White went for.} 26. Nxe5 {Trying to win a pawn.} Qxc1+ 27. Nxc1 Bb7 {Now the e-pawn can't be defended a second time and will fall.} 28. Kf1 Nxe4 {Now f2 is under threat.} 29. Bxe4 Bxe4 {Even without the extra pawn, this would be very good for Black. The Bishop pair is much better than two Knights.} 30. Ne2 {Trying to activate the Nc1.} f6 {This small pawn move has many points. It asks the Ne5 where it wants to go, it makes room for the King to come to f7 and it creates the threat of Bd3.} 31. Nd7 {The intermediate move 31.Nc3 would have been slightly better but after 31...Bxg2+ 32.Kxg2 fxe5 Black is two pawns up.} Ba7 {Temporarily trapping the Knight. Now White has to prepare an answer to Bc6.} 32. b4 Bd3 {Securing an easily won K+P ending.} 33. f3 Kf7 34. Ke1 Bxe2 35. Kxe2 Ke7 36. Nc5 Bxc5 37. bxc5 e5 {White can't even protect the c-pawn so he resigned. It's hard to say where White went wrong. He never made a clear mistake. Black's game went very smooth from start to finish.}
