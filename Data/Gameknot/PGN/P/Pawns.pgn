1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 {I have always wondered about this. My bishop isn't doing anything dangerous why waste a move trying to chase it away. Leaving it and getting on with normal development seems more logical. A pawn retake, if I capture the knight, is going to produce a doubled pawn and if I meant to withdraw the bishop I wouldn't have made that move. More on this..} Bxc3 {Naturally.} 5. bxc3 {And now.. Is this the correct retake? I really dont know. Someone enlighten me please. Ok its "capturing towards the center" but it is capturing a bishop. It seems to me that an argument can be made for white to go for a wide open game giving his bishop-pair better mobility. Or?} Nf6 6. Bc4 O-O 7. d3 d6 {this is the reason I had for wanting to trade of my DSB. I always feel it gets rather limited behind this sort of pawn structure.} 8. h3 Bd7 {Now, why did I do that? It's a useless move. Most likely I made it just to get the bishop off the 8-th rank. Be6 atleast would have made some difference.} 9. Bg5 Be6 {I could have had this move for something more useful. :-) I mean Bishops can move more than one square at a time.} 10. Bxe6 {Now we exchange pieces. In my oppinion maybe its a little premature.} fxe6 11. d4 Qe8 12. Bxf6 Rxf6 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Nxe5 dxe5 {Ok, only the big guns left. I'm better here IMHO. We both have three pawn islands and a doubled pawn each. However my doubled pawn have more influence in the center and have advanced to ranks 6 and 5. My queen side pawns look very nice concidering whats up against them.  } 15. O-O Qf7 16. Rb1 Rf8 {Attack is the best defence. He really can't take that hanging pawn now can he.} 17. f3 {Makes my big battery fairly useless. I did expect this last move. But it was a nice interlude. } b6 {"Unhanging" the pawn. I was thinking about the more elegant c6. One always wants to look good, but alas, that would have opened up for his queen on d6 and that would have been, ehm, not very fun.} 18. c4 {Now white is aiming to trade off his bad pawn for one of my good ones.} a6 {Preparing b5 if he pushes that pawn. } 19. Qe2 {Playing into my hands aiming at the haning a pawn but after b5 there is no threat.} Qe7 {This was to free up my c-pawn relieving it of its guard duty on d6. It also attacks his hanging a-pawn.} 20. c5 {A real misstake. White misses the fact that his king is on g1 and that Qxc5  has that annoying ' ' at the end. Had his king been on h1 he would have had quite strong play on the queen side. I think.} Qxc5+ {A free pawn. This gives me all the time I need.} 21. Kh1 b5 22. a4 c6 23. axb5 cxb5 {Those a and b pawns are quite strong there.} 24. Rfc1 {I think there maybe better moves for white. This doesn't accomplish much. Ra1 could maybe have been more troublesome or maybe Rfd1.} Ra8 {Moving a rook behind the passed pawn.} 25. c4 {This is also a a strange move. This was why he put his rook on c3. As long as I don't move my queen from c5, a good square where she is as unassilable as the moon, that pawn is just going to get in his way.} b4 {Naturally. Creating an advanced protected passed pawn, that is going to prove decisive. Here white has a rook sac to contemplate. I have the queen side locked down and those pawns needs looking after.} 26. g4 {So here comes the kingside pawns.} Rf7 {Expecting to see g5 next.} 27. g5 g6 {Ok thats as far as you get pal. Now white has a weak square on f4. His plan is to advance his nominal pawn majority on my king. A dangerous plan with exellent possibilities. He really should back that plan up with some muscle Qf2 maybe, covering both f4 and backing up the h pawn.} 28. h4 {Premature. Not a too serious mistake though: 28. ... Rf4 29. Qf2 still has possibilities.} Rf4 29. h5 {This however is borderline silly. (no disrespect intended to my opponent) This is the kind of move I make all the time, luckily I was on the right side this time.} Rh4+ 30. Kg2 Rxh5 31. Qd2 {Ok. I'm another pawn up but look at the sorry state of my rook on the h-file. He can easily use his king to trap my rook. Dangerous. I didn't spot it yet though.} a5 {Protecting my pawn. Now is when I saw the danger to my rook. I realised that Kg3 would make me play almost a rook down. I dont like the line: 31. Kg3 Qd4 32. Rb2 Qxd2 33. Rxd2 Rxg5  34. Kh3 Rh5  35. Kg4 There may be much better lines but that was the one I feared.} 32. Rch1 {Another not so good move. Allows me an even trade for my poor rook.} Qd4 {After calculating I decided to do this "inbetween" move.  A truly stupid decision. Knowing the things I knew about my position, why oh why did I not just take the Rook? Now: 33. Rhd1 Qxd2 34. Rxd2 Rxg5  35. Kh3 Rh4  36. Kg4 (bad) or: 33. Rhd1 Rd8 34. Rb2 Kf7 35. Ra2 (worse) I should have gotten myself in real trouble here. } 33. Rbd1 {Wrong rook. White thinks like I did when calculating Qd4. Thankfully.} Rxh1 {At last.. } 34. Kxh1 Qxd2 {This is the time for the queen trade.  My passed pawns will prevail.} 35. Rxd2 b3 36. c5 {A race he can't win.} a4 37. c6 a3 38. c7 b2 39. Rd8+ {Capturing the rook is out of the question.} Kf7 40. Rd7+ {but he should probably have taken mine. Not that he would have had much chance. This game is mine.} Ke8 41. Rxh7 b1=Q+ 42. Kg2 Rc8 {Last comment: I put this rook here because I have seen myself loose better positions :-)} 43. Rg7 a2 44. f4 Qc2+ 45. Kg3 a1=Q 46. Kg4 Qg2+ 47. Kh4 Qah1# {}
