[Opening "Sicilian defence (B30)"]

1. e4 {Simple enough. } c5 {Normally I don't like Sicilian as Black but I felt I might as well try it on this blitz game.} 2. Nf3 {A rather common move, attacks the center while developing on the kingside.} Nc6 {This one is to counter 2.Nf3, as they both attack the same spaces.  A battle over the center should occur.} 3. Bc4 {Not at all uncommon; White wants to get his pieces developed here.} e6 {This allows the Queen and Bishop to get out from the back rank and is rather a defensive move compared to the alternate 3...e6, though it sets up well for a good formation.} 4. d4 {This is ambitious and continues White's aggressive, attacking game, and asserts more control over the center.} b6 {This move is perhaps not the best, though it does afford the c-pawn more protection.  That said, 4...d6 might have been better, and the Black setup appears a bit disjointed already.} 5. dxc5 {This was unnecessary, as it disrupts White's development in the center.  Perhaps White was hoping for a 5...bxc5, leaving the c-pawn isolated and weakening Black's queenside badly, but it backfired.} Bxc5 {This is absolutely the best move, as it leaves Black's pawn structure intact and gets the bishop to the center quickly.  Now the advantage swings a bit to Black, whose pieces are better coordinated.} 6. O-O {This is more of a waiting move but castling is effective, a good way to recover after a mistake one move before.} d6 {This protects the center and the bishop on c5, but perhaps Black forgets that it prevents retreat for that bishop.} 7. Be3 {This move is good for both sides as it invites 7...Bxc3, which helps White by removing Black's strong bishop from the board and helps Black by removing a bishop which is stranded in the middle of the board (if it were captured, recapturing with the d-pawn allows uncomfortable space toward the center and recapturing with the b-pawn is asking for a queenside attack.} Bxe3 {Simple, and it benefits White by doubling pawns on the e-file, assuming a recapture by the f-pawn.} 8. fxe3 {The only sensible move here.} Bb7 {Evidently Black is angling for a discovered attack on White's unprotected pawn on e4.} 9. Bb5 {This takes that plan away with a pin on the king.} a6 {Forcing the bishop to do something - in other words, "s*** or get off the pot."} 10. Bxc6+ {White's been attacking all game and his game plan depends on maintaining this momentum.} Bxc6 {Black has the advantage at this point.  He has given up a knight and a bishop but has both of White's bishops, and he has a hedgehog formation set up.  Plus, he avoids the clogging up that this position usually entails, as his Queen has a path out of the back.  White, meanwhile, has castled, but has doubled pawns on the e-file and, the kingside is weak.} 11. Nc3 {Good development here, as White needs to get going on his game plan.} Qd7 {Keeping in tune with Black's generally defensive strategy, despite the Sicilian opening.} 12. Qd4 {White brings the Queen out; he's ready for a brawl.} f6 {Black's strategy is interesting as he extends the hedgehog.  This move is calculated to avoid the Queen taking the g-pawn and taking the rook, but it provides an interesting vanguard of pawns.} 13. Qxb6 {White sees an undefended pawn and takes it, gaining an inroads into a suddenly weak-looking queenside.} Qb7 {Black, seeing White's queen advancing far into his formation and threatening to blow it up, decides to fix it now and trade queens.} 14. Qxb7 {White accepts.} Bxb7 {And Black finishes the job.} 15. Rad1 {White, still aggressive, moves his rook out, trying to get at Black's pawns.} O-O-O {Black defends his d-pawn while getting his rook into the game.  A good move, although the knight and rook stuck in the corner are a bit concerning.} 16. Nd4 {White sees another undefended pawn and attacks it.} e5 {Black eliminates the pawn and attacks the knight, building a pawn wedge in the middle of the board.} 17. Ne6 {Still kicking with the knight, White moves to attack the rook; his aggression is beginning to come at the expense of development.} Rd7 {Black moves his rook out of the line of fire and defends the g-pawn, which is also attacked by the knight.} 18. Na4 {White moves to set up a check involving both of his knights.} Re7 {While White's messing around with his knights isn't getting much done, Black's move to attack the knight rather than develop his knight or other rook isn't all that much better.} 19. Rxd6 {White takes the undefended pawn; his attack has suddenly become potent and serious.} Bxe4 {This move is not particularly fantastic but it does get rid of a White pawn while maintaining a presence on the a8-h1 diagonal; Nh6 would be still better to get some protection on the eighth rank.} 20. Nb6+ {One of two safe check options (the other being Rd8+), this one is on the whole better as it involves three of White's pieces and has possibilities written all over it.} Kb8 {One of White's only two legal moves, and it is probably better than coming to the seventh rank in the long term.} 21. Nd7+ {More checks.} Kc8 {Black wants to force White to move the knight again.} 22. Nb6+ {White delivers check again.} Kb8 {Black is thinking about a draw by repetition.} 23. c3 {Solely to avoid the draw.  White thinks he has this game won.} Nh6 {Black finally sees the light and gets his rook involved.  His knight is also out and ready to get involved.} 24. Nd7+ {White makes a bad decision here.  He is reluctant to exchange rooks because that would emasculate his current attack and he is enamored of it, unwilling to regroup, bring out his second rook, or, God forbid, develop a few pawns.} Kc8 {Same reasoning here.} 25. Nb6+ {White continues to check.} Kb8 {Black is once again willing to take the threefold draw.} 26. Nd5 {White finally pulls back, although this looks to continue the same general attack of the past few moves.} Rhe8 {Black blunders away his rook trying to take a knight.} 27. Nxe7 {White takes the opportunity he gets.} Rxe7 {Black must, of course, take the knight.} 28. Rxa6 {White might as well wreak havoc here.} Bd3 {Black forks the two rooks on the same diagonal.  A good move here, though moving the knight into the fray would not be a bad idea as well.} 29. Rd1 {White misses the fork here: Rb6+ could force the King to move and save both rooks.  This would get a "??" as it absolutely loses the rook.} Bxa6 {And who is Black to give up a free rook?} 30. Rd8+ {White, who will not be happy to have lost his rook, might as well check, though he needs to get his pawns moving.} Bc8 {Not necessarily the best move, as Kb7 might have been better, but this one isn't too bad, given that it appears to be setting up for a Kb7 at some point.} 31. Nf8 {An attempt to take material rather than build an attack.} Nf7 {Black is now defending well, note the coordination among his pieces, even though he is playing complete defense at the moment.} 32. Nd7+ {A weak check, meant to keep the attack going but gaining a "?".} Rxd7 {Black is perfectly willing to not only take the knight but trade rooks if White wants to, as he can then exploit his material advantage and mow down White's undeveloped pawns.} 33. Rg8 {Still trying to gain material rather than get out and regroup.} Rd1+ {Amazingly, Black's first check of the match.  There isn't much behind it but Black is trying to turn the game toward his own attack.} 34. Kf2 {Forced.} g6 {Black is not yet ready to start picking off pawns and chooses to protect his own.} 35. Rg7 {A good move under the circumstances; Black wins a pawn.} Ng5 {This gets the knight out of harm's way but also gets an attack going.} 36. Ke2 {White is tired of having Black's rook in the way and moves to get it out.} Rd7 {Black offers a rook trade and protects his h-pawn.} 37. Rg8 {White knows enough not to give up his last piece, and while still in deep trouble, looks to finally have some idea of what to do.} Kc7 {A good move by Black; it allows the bishop a way out, protects the bishop, and begins to get the King into the game.} 38. h4 {Moving his pawns (finally), though apparently more to attack the knight.} Ba6+ {A nice intermezzo, finally getting the bishop off the back rank.} 39. Ke1 {Simply moving out of check, though Kf2 might have been better.} Ne4 {No safe check here, so Black moves the knight out of danger while still threatening.} 40. Ra8 {Attacks the bishop, no more or less.} Bc4 {The bishop may as well get closer to the action.} 41. b3 {Done to attack the bishop rather than out of any genuine desire to get the pawns involved. Apparently he has not heard Philidor's "pawns are the soul of chess" (Black, though he is down two pawns and has only moved one pawn since move 16, has incorporated them much more into his game and is getting more mileage out of them).} Bd5 {Black has to get the bishop out of the way, of course, and also attacks the rook.} 42. Ra7+ {White has little choice.} Kc6 {No more using the bishop to block the rook's check, Black is ready to exchange.} 43. Ra6+ {But White refuses to exchange and keeps chasing.} Kb5 {White can't chase anymore and has to do something else.} 44. Ra4 {He retreats instead.} Nxc3 {A good move, attacking the rook while limiting the King's scope of movement.} 45. Rg4 {Again, White is forced to get the rook out of there.} f5 {This attacks the rook and builds a nice pawn chain, as Black continues to develop his position and force the rook to move for the fifth time in a row.} 46. a4+ {A simple check, compounded by White's inability to move the the b4 square, which would normally be ideal.} Nxa4 {This gets a "?" as he blunders away the knight.} 47. bxa4+ {Check again.} Ka5 {He doesn't have much choice, though the block of the pawn is well chosen - it keeps the King relevant (though out of the way of his own pieces) and avoids any promotion scares.} 48. Rg3 {White doesn't have many good moves and needs to get his rook out of danger; he has no safe moves on the fourth rank and moving it to g5 traps it.  The pawn on h4 becomes a liability as it prevents the rook from getting at Black's pawn on h2 and attacking the pawn chain.} Bb3 {Though Black could easily move Kxa4 here, the pawn is not dangerous and he has bigger plans, setting up with this movement of his bishop to set up a back-rank check.} 49. h5 {The pawn chain, which Black has lovingly maintained, is dominating the board and limiting White's ability to operate on the kingside, which allows White to congregate his superior forces and infiltrate on the other side of the board.  It has got to go.} gxh5 {Black obliges, though he won't be the first to lose a pawn.  It was inevitable anyway.} 50. Rg5 {Now White moves his rook to the fifth rank attempting to pick off the pawns one by one; he still has some hopes of winning or at least drawing the match.} Bxa4 {Black will lose a pawn in the course of the turn and figures he might as well finally take that a-pawn.} 51. Rxf5 {Nothing unexpected.} Rd1+ {Not bad, but there are other good moves (Re7, defending two of his remaining pawns, or Rg7, attacking Black's weak g-pawn).  He appears to be ready to harass the White King.} 52. Ke2 {Of the two legal moves, probably the better, keeping the rook in range.} Rd5 {Now Black wants to defend his e-pawn and protect his King.} 53. Rxh5 {It was there for the taking.} Bb5+ {Increasingly weaker checks, though Black is evidently trying to drive the King towards the kingside.} 54. Kf2 {Arguably not the best move; Ke1 may be better here.} Rd2+ {Another check trying to move the King away from his pawns and get the pawns off the board.} 55. Kg3 {White finally decides to give up on the first rank.} e4 {Black blocks the movement of the e-pawn and sets up the e-pawns as the spot for the showdown at the end of the match.} 56. Rxh7 {I don't quite like this move.  The h-pawn is by now basically a nonentity and should play no role in the game.  I prefer 56. Kf4 Rxg2 57. Kxe4 with some parity.  At this point, Black will be forced to either lose his h-pawn anyway or fanatically protect it, and the bishop will likely be sacrificed at some point to prevent promotion of White's e-pawn, leaving king and rook on both sides.  Not well done here.  White botches a strong comebakc.} Ka4 {Black, getting let off the hook, begins to move his King where it needs to go.  Should White attack e4 now, the bishop can merely slide to c6.} 57. Re7 {Of course White does attack, winning some points for getting his rook involved.} Bc6 {Black faithfully moves his bishop over, avoiding a move to d3 so as to prevent a pin to the rook on the d-file.} 58. Ra7+ {Another bad move, earning a "?" for missing the opportunity of Kf4, winning the e-file and e-pawn for White, and giving up only its moribund g-pawn in the process.  Instead, a cheap check.} Kb5 {Black will protect his bishop as long as the King's moving.} 59. Rh7 {White is gearing up either for a move onto the fifth rank, which seems more likely, or is moving around the whole fray to the first rank.} Re2 {Black breaks the standoff by forcing some action, attacking the e-pawn and resolving to win either the e- or g-pawn in the process.} 60. Rh5+ {Another check, but one which allows White's rook to come into the fray.  Better.} Kc4 {Black's King, on the retreat, seeks to get involved in the upcoming battle over the e-file.} 61. Rh6 {An attack on the bishop, which, although it forestalls action about which pawn to save by White, gets Black's bishop moving.} Bd5 {The bishop might as well clog things up too.} 62. Kf4 {There are no more checks or cheap attacks on the bishop.  White chooses (correctly) the e-pawn over the g-pawn.} Kd3 {This is a calculated "error." While it opens the door for 63. Rd6, pinning the bishop to the King, Black can safely take the e-pawn at that point and be, in effect, a pawn ahead, if we do not count the irrelevant g-pawn.} 63. Rh3 {This move is made to protect the g-pawn from the previous scenario.} Rxg2 {Seeing that plan thwarted, Black takes the g-pawn; the next logical step for White is to involve that piece and Black would rather not see that happen.} 64. Ke5 {A good check, this threatens to rid Black of his bishop, the foundation of his formation.} Rg5+ {A well-done check, this protects the bishop at the same time.} 65. Kf4 {This is a type of zugzwang, with none of Black's three legal moves being very savory.  Kd6 or Kf6 attack Black pieces but leave the King no opportunity to get back to the battle over the e-pawns.  This one saves the e-pawn but does not give the King much chance to capture any of the pieces.} Rg1 {With no great move coming for the rook, this one gets it out of trouble and allows it to regroup.} 66. Ke5 {Trying the same thing over again, White may now be the one thinking about threefold repetition.} Bb3 {Black, who has the clear upper hand and whose King protects it e-pawn, will have no part of it.} 67. Rh4 {A simple assault on Black's pawn.} Rg5+ {One of the only good moves Black has.  He will force the King to move either to Kf4, preventing a capture on his own pawn, or a move to the sixth rank, not allowing the King to attack Black's pawn and allowing Black to take White's pawn and not worry about king-bishop-rook vs. king-rook endgame just yet, which would occur on 67...Kxe3 68. Rxe4+.  (I may confess that I, as White, had the luxury of knowing that my endgame play in that sort of situation is not great.)} 68. Kf4 {The only move to keep him in the fight.} Ra5 {Once again, getting the rook out of the way.} 69. Rh8 {Possibly to try to check the King along the d-file.} Ra3 {Intended to protect the bishop in case of an attack on the b-file.} 70. Rd8+ {The check comes, and it works.} Ke2 {Black has to do this.} 71. Kxe4 {Finally! (If you hadn't noticed yet, Black's game had become more about protecting his own pawn than taking White's.)} Bc2+ {A simple check opportunity intended to start driving the King away from his pawn.} 72. Kd4 {A bad move, it allows for Rd3+, winning White's rook.  However, that still leaves the tricky matter of the e-pawn, and the exchange probably would have transpired thus: 72...Rd3+ 73. Ke5 Rxd1 74. e4 Bxe4 75. Kxe4.  Given that this was a blitz game, which rarely if ever include resignations, this would have required me to play out a king-rook vs. king endgame, which I have messed up before (see my rating) and I was not eager to relive.  Instead, I chose the other alternative.} Rxe3 {Here is an opportunity to see if my opponent makes one more mistake, or if I can outmaneuver him.} 73. Rc8 {A simple, cheap move to force Black to do something.} Rd3+ {And Black did something.  White's King has four moves, only one of which will not lead to the loss of his rook (Ke5).} 74. Ke4 {Unfortunately White makes one final mistake and it's over.} Rc3+ {Yeah...} 75. Kd4 {And White resigned here.  Overall, White got an early jump but the tide turned for two reasons: White's unwillingness to come back and stop the obsessive attacks and the difference in the use of pawns.  Whit got doubled pawns early and after this eschewed the use of pawns until it was too late, and even then as attack pieces rather than for development and positional purposes.  Black, meanwhile, quietly built good pawn structure and made his pawns the center of his game, and this eventually gave him a win.}
