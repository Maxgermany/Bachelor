[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 {White pulls an unorthodox opening, the Greek Attack, Bent Larsen's pet opening (commonly called Larsen's Opening in his honor).  The idea here is to fianchetto the black-square bishop and control the center, somewhat in hypermodern fashion.  Larsen himself used it to try to force an opponent who may not have seen this very much to play on his merits alone, rather than knowledge of openings, and I suspect my opponent may have done the same.} e5 {Black chooses not to do something bizarre in response and goes into a normal opening.} 2. Bb2 {Based on the first move, there is no reason not to move the bishop there, with the added benefit that it attacks Black's e-pawn.} f6 {Some might try Bd6 to defend the pawn but that traps the white-squared bishop or forces it into a similar fianchetto.} 3. g3 {More with the fianchetto...} Bc5 {Black chooses not to counter the fianchetto (on either side) and is intent on center development rather than flanking.} 4. Bg2 {White follows through.} d6 {Black now has a nice pawn wedge in the center and defends the bishop as well.} 5. h4 {White continually trying to flank-attack.} Be6 {This is a decent move - the bishop lies in wait and is a good defender in the middle.} 6. a4 {More on the flanks - it makes for a bizarre-looking position.} c6 {Black looks to be trying to attack the b5 square.} 7. h5 {Truly bizarre. An isolated h-pawn swerves little purpose other than to get the rook in the fray early, and that doesn't appear to be viable at all here.} g5 {Not the best move in the world - Black  is trying to construct a stonewall but he appears to forget about the en passant capture (8. hxg5), which would throw a wrench into his kingside defense.} 8. d3 {White passes up the en passant to make a foray into the center.} Nh6 {A good move, getting the knight into a position by which he begin to harass White's formation.} 9. a5 {More weird flank moves.  The same goes here as for move 7.} b6 {Black's got a plan to get his queen out, possibly, and certainly is worried about the isolated pawn on that side.  He is not content to block that one as he's done on the h-file.} 10. axb6 {White gets greedy here and obliges - a6 would have been arguably better.} Bxb6 {Slightly questionable, as a queen capture would have gotten her involved, but Black continues to play defensive and the move isn't bad.} 11. c4 {A pawn wedge is constructed, possibly trying to make a stonewall.} d5 {Black has had enough of this pawn development and wishes to continue control of the center.} 12. cxd5 {Questionable - e4 would have been better.} Bxd5 {Well done, inviting the next move.} 13. Bxd5 {Really the only choice.} Qxd5 {Finishing up this brawl, the queen attacks White's rook and dominates the board.} 14. f3 {White does not want his rook attacked and chooses defense here.} g4 {Black figures to blow up White's formation even more. } 15. Nc3 {White figures to attack Black's queen with this intermezzo.} Qe6 {Not a bad move to withdraw the queen, really the best move available.  It provides more defense for the g-pawn.} 16. fxg4 {White goes back to the rapidly collapsing kingside: the situation isn't good but 16. f4 would not be much better.} Nxg4 {Black chooses to get the knight close to the White king: Black's bishop and queen are positioned well for an attack and it could get interesting.} 17. h6 {A completely wasted move.  White could have moved either one of his knights or his e-pawn (to get his queen some working space) but he decides to move his pawn instead.  Utterly inexplicable.} Ne3 {The Black knight (always triumphs!) is now in full harassment mode: not only is he attacking the queen, but is one move away from a check, as well as controlling space around White's home base.} 18. Qd2 {Forced, pretty much, although this move allows a possible castle, which would be highly recommended for White.} Ng2+ {No castle anymore.} 19. Kd1 {Forced.  White may be stupid, but he's not stupid enough to move his king out to the open f-file.} Ne3+ {Black misses a chance to really corner White with 19...Qxb3+.  That said, Black continues the pattern of checks; he dares White to take his knight.} 20. Ke1 {White does the same as two moves previously.} Ng2+ {Black (me) now saw the missed opportunity from two moves ago and bids to do it now.} 21. Kd1 {White obliges, again wishing to avoid the open f-file.  He has obviously missed the mate Black has in store.} Qxb3+ {The first blow. White could trade queens here and be left in an inferior but not awful position, but he chooses not to do so.} 22. Kc1 {Whoops.  Black sees that the queen can be pinned.} Be3 {And does it.} 23. Qxe3 {There is no choice on this one.} Nxe3 {Obviously.  White may as well have resigned a move ago.} 24. Ra3 {The only move that can save White here is Kd2 but he doesn't see it.} Qc2# {White's obsessive pawn development at the expense of positional development has absolutely killed him.}
