[Opening "Philidor (C41), Hanham, Krause variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {One of the most ancient of chess defenses, the Philidor is these days considered drawish. White typically achieves a spatial advantage while Black builds a hard shell around his King and plays to weather the storm. Of course, theory isn't always the same as practice; or, as they say in the NFL, "That's why they play the games."} 3. d4 Nd7 {This is a little unusual, a transposition of the moves of the Hanham variation. The usual move order is 3. ...Nf6  4. Nc3 Nbd7.} 4. Bc4 {The book move, which is evaluated as +/= (slight advantage to White).} Be7 5. O-O Ngf6 6. Re1 c6 7. c3 Qc7 8. Bb3 {It's tempting to say each side is playing "If you ignore me, I'll ignore you," but that's not what's happening at all. In fact, each player is carefully jockeying for the advantage in the center, and the tension is building.} O-O 9. Nbd2 a5 {Grabbing some space on the Q-side. The game is already beginning to develop the feel of a Ruy Lopez in the respective strategies of the players.} 10. Nf1 Nb6 {?! -- The more natural 10. ...b5 seems more in order.} 11. Bc2 {! -- This move highlights the slight misplacement of Black's QN. Inconsequential is 11. ...Nc4  12. b3 kicking the steed right back to its awkward square, and if 11. ...a4  12. Bd3.} Bg4 12. Ne3 Bd7 13. Bd2 a4 14. c4 {! -- Stealing some space and further underscoring Black's uncomfortable post at b6 since the Knight now has no retreat (should one be needed) except to c8} c5 15. dxe5 dxe5 16. Bc3 {Very tense, and I wasn't even really sure who's better at the moment.} Bd6 17. a3 Ng4 18. Nd5 {!? -- I also considered 18. Ng4 Bg4  19.h3 with mere equality ...the text move, after all, exchanges Black's bad Knight for one of White's good ones. But I felt that playing the N to d5 actually gave me a lasting positional advantage: after an exchange there, both of White's Bishops are aimed right at Black's King, and a break at f4 would be easy to engineer, opening the diagonals. Plus, with my QB on c3 Black's hope of expanding on the Q-side is stymied. Not an easy position to win for White, for sure, but the chances to create and use pressure seem to be mine not Black's.} Nxd5 19. cxd5 c4 20. h3 Nf6 21. Qd2 Nh5 {?! -- The losing move. problem is, White gets to play next.} 22. Qg5 {Black now must lose the e-pawn, and can ill-afford to do so. However, things aren't yet a cakewalk for White who still requires a little help from Black to end up with the advantage.} Nf4 23. Bxe5 Bxe5 {An alternative was 23. ...f6!?  24. Bd6 Qd6  25. Qg3 Qb8 with counterplay, although White is still a pawn to the good.} 24. Qxe5 Qxe5 25. Nxe5 Bb5 26. g3 {! -- If 26. ...Nh3?  27. Kg2 Ng5  28. f4 leaves Black's steed nowhere to go.} Nd3 27. Bxd3 cxd3 28. Ng4 {! -- Heading for e3 to guard c2.} Rac8 {?! - Better was 28. ...f5! splitting White's center pawns and opening lines for Black} 29. Ne3 d2 {? -- This simply loses the pawn, though now it's hard to suggest any good move for Black.} 30. Red1 Rc1 {?? -- This exchange doesn't help.} 31. Raxc1 dxc1=N 32. Rxc1 {And, two pawns ahead, White mopped up shortly.  ...1 - 0}
