1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 {the Slav Defence. the Slav is a solid line against the queens gambit where black retains some counterattacking chances.} 3. Nf3 {mainline} a6 4. Nc3 dxc4 {Nf6 would lead to a more normal position, black is trying to hold on to the extra pawn but this cannot be done} 5. a4 {preventing blacks intended ...b5} Bf5 {? giving white a free tempo. black already has a difficult position, the only reason the position isn't losing for black is the b4 square. black should be trying to get his dark squared bishop to b4 } 6. e4 {forcing the bishop to move again} Bg4 {should have moved here first time round.} 7. Be3 {defending the d4 pawn again so white can play Qxf3 if black decides to capture the knight.} e6 {white has a definite plus here, i control the centre well and have a development advantage.} 8. Bxc4 Nd7 {black should probably develop his kingside and castle quickly as it is clear white is going to start attacking in the centre soon} 9. O-O {removing the king from the centre before comencing operations in the centre} Ngf6 10. Re1 Bb4 {black finally takes advantage of the b4 square but this should really have been done earlier when the king was still in the centre when the bishop on b4 would cause white some problems. as it is black isn't even threatening the e4 pawn as he would have been if the king was on e1} 11. d5 {white breaks in the centre while the black king remains in the centre} cxd5 12. exd5 exd5 {?? loses instantly. black should try ...e5 trying to keep the centre closed} 13. Bb6+ {the black queen is history} Qe7 14. Rxe7+ Kxe7 {black hopes to win another minor piece for his queen, maybe Bxe7 retaining the option of castling is a better try} 15. Nxd5+ {the only way to hold on to the extra piece. } Nxd5 16. Qxd5 Be6 {taking the bishop loses to Qxf7  when white regains at least a piece due to the 3 loose black pieces} 17. Qe4 {Strong move, black doesn't win the bishop on b6 as 17...Nxb6 18.Bxe6 reveals an attack from the queen onto the b4 bishop.} Rhb8 {?? loses another piece, Black needed to move the dark square bishop} 18. Bxe6 fxe6 19. Qxb4+ Kf7 20. Ng5+ {the white pieces start moving in for the kill, black needs to be careful here...} Kg8 {?! not a good square for the king, e8 looks better although it is quite unnatural to centralise the kingin this situation! } 21. Qe7 {now white has mating threats that need to be dealt with} Nxb6 {?? now white can force a standard mate.} 22. Qxe6+ Kh8 23. Nf7+ {1-0 the finish is a standard smothered mate, 23...Kg8 24.Nh6   Kh8 25.Qg8!  Rxg8 26.Nf7#}
