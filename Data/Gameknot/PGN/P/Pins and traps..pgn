1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Qe7 {An Icelandic, "strong line", with this awkward move. } 5. Qe2 {With this, White is almost ok, so I tried something different. } e5 6. Nf3 {I had to keep on pushing the pawn. } Bg4 7. h3 Bh5 8. d3 {My pawn push is stopped. } Nbd7 9. g4 Bg6 10. Bg5 O-O-O 11. a3 {Good move. My next one would have been Qb4.} Qd6 {Until now, the pins have been normal. This move helps redeploy my Q, free the e column, the dsb... but has a downside. } 12. Ne4 Bxe4 {Almost forced, or the Q goes to b6, but with no perspectives. } 13. dxe4 Qb6 {Still, b3 can be a good outpost. } 14. b4 {Ok, white is threatening hard, so I have to came up with something new. } Bxb4+ 15. axb4 Qxb4+ {I swear this gives me some compensation for the pieces, more than the 2 pawns. } 16. Bd2 Qb2 17. Rxa7 Qb1+ {This was in the spotlight. } 18. Qd1 {QxQ, followed by Nxe4 doesn't seem enough. } Qxe4+ {Pinning the N...} 19. Be2 {...and the B. Now, c5 was interesting, but I went, very "naively"...} Nc5 {Threatening Nd3+.} 20. Kf1 {The white N is pinned (not the B anymore), but I can't see any good way to attack. h5 is not promising. } Na6 {Well, this forces him in Ra1+, or he will lose an exchange. I expected Be3, but my opponent went...} 21. Rg1 {...unpinning the N. } c6 {Threatening d5, with the threat to pin the B, but overlooking white's possible reactions. } 22. Ng5 {Good move, forcing me back into...} Qg6 23. h4 {Good move, threatening to trap my Q.} Ne4 {Planning a counter sac.  Nd7 was wiser, but I don't like to go back, if possible. } 24. h5 Nxf2 {I have an almost trapped rook for the next "free" move. c5 is still mine, if I have the tempo to play c6. } 25. hxg6 {Accepting the exchange, that gives much danger to white. } Nxd1 {forced. } 26. Nxf7 Rdf8 {The N is pinned, the next move the pawn g6 will be gone, and the only move that allows W to save this N is Rg3 (to Rf3), but that gives me tempo to play save the N or to take the pawn g6, or to threaten the Ra7...} 27. Ra8+ {If I move the king, allowing RxR, RxR, the pawn in g6 can become dangerous after Ke1 by white. } Nb8 {Freeing the R. } 28. Bxd1 hxg6 {White choose the best option, freeing the R and keeping the bishop pair. } 29. g5 {...to give more squares to the lsb, but closing the diag for the other. } Rxf7+ 30. Ke1 Rh4 31. Be3 {Looking for Ba7, winnin the N. } Re4 {Pinned. } 32. Kd2 Kc7 {Unpinned (and saved). } 33. Bc2 Rxc4 34. Bxg6 Rd7 {Pinned pawn. } 35. Bd3 Rxd5 {Pinned bishop. This dance is really interesting and funny. A pity my opponen blundered here. } 36. Rg4 Rxg4 {...and no one will know how this nice endgame would have been :-(}
