1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 e6 4. dxe6 {...neglecting the stronger Bb5+, as most low-rated games. I can play against it, but it is certainly more delicate for black. } Bxe6 5. Nf3 c6 {Bg4 gives black a Portuguese Attack with a tempo less, so it can't be good. Now my plan is to castle queenside and throw pawns on white's castled king. White can win this race, but he has to be very precise. Let's see if my opp is.} 6. Bd3 Nbd7 7. O-O {The right move. Now white threatens Re1 and Ng5. } Qc7 {Better is to castle and to prevent Bf4.} 8. Nc3 {Some players prefer c4. This is a tempo for me to consolidate my position. } h6 {If Re1, o-o-o. Then, white can get ideas of RxB, and it is another game. } 9. Re1 O-O-O 10. Be3 {Threatens d5, x-raying a7.} g5 {I don't care. I have to attack asap.} 11. d5 Nxd5 12. Nxd5 Bxd5 13. c4 Be6 {White will eventually break into my Qside, so I have to keep chances on his Kside.} 14. Bxa7 {I should have left it where it is, that's all! Now I have another tempo to build my attack: g4, Be7...} b6 {I wanted to trap it, but it was the beginning of a more complicated motif. } 15. Qa4 {Qa6+ is threatened. } Nc5 16. Qa3 Rxd3 17. b3 {Here I didn't see Bxc4... but I'm not sure I would have played it, (after Re3). It's a nice position: the N5 can discover an attack on the WQ, but if he does, it allows Qa6+. Something has to protect a6. But I was focused on the threat on Rh8 after Qb2.  } Rg8 18. Ne5 {Threatens my R... } Qb7 {If NxR, NxN, Q moves and I win back the exchange with N+Re1. } 19. Bxb6 {QxB, Qa1+ will allow his Q to fly and to take Rd3.} Na6 20. Qa5 {Qa4 may have been better. Now I have...} Bb4 21. Qa4 {Still, I'm not getting anywhere! QxB, NxR...} Bxe1 22. Nxd3 Qxb6 23. Rxe1 {Not a wonderful outcome! It could be worse. } Rd8 24. Ne5 Rd2 {? Well, this allows Qxc6+, QxQ, NxQ, Rxa2. Not so bad...} 25. c5 {Ouch! Of course if Qxc4, QxN+ and so on for a perpetual. } Nxc5 {I think there is nothing to do, but let's see...} 26. Qa8+ Kc7 27. Rc1 {Ouch! Pinning my N! Now, I coudn't thinh in Rxf2, and if KxR, Nd3++, followed by NxR. I couldn't be sure KxR was forced, and if RxN instead? I didn't have the "tactic spirit" to play it, and I choosed to defend c6.} Bd5 28. Qe8 {! Now Qd7+ is theatened! I can't move the N. Again, I sensed I had Rxf2, but I feared any possible in-between move, like Qe7+, followed by QxN. Fortunately, this threat is not possible due to back rank mate threat! Shall I explain it all? :-)} Kb7 {This is to escape via a6. } 29. Qe7+ Ka6 30. h3 {Escaping the back rank mate, thus threatening Nc5 "for real".} Ne4 {Well, finally I managed to play this move. But now, white can still pursue the perpetual.} 31. Qa3+ Kb7 32. Qe7+ {I had no escape, and I should have accepted the perpetual and that's all, but I wanted to be smarter... and I blundered. } Kb8 33. Nd7+ {I resigned. I was punished by my overpretensions. I wonder if I could have driven the game into a winning endgame, after the Q's exchange. Thanks you for reading and comments are welcomed!}
