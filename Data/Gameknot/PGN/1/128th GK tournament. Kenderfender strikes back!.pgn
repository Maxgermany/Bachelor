1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {Inducing the closed variation } Nc6 3. d3 g6 {Now the mirrored fianchetto position , classic development in this variation. BB will have an excellent control of a1-h8 whiles white's may be more limited in his control due to e4 blockade, which will prompt white to induce a future advance, being supported by either d4 or f4.} 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 d6 6. Nge2 {Many players also prefer Nf3, and in fact is better in case you want a strong center, but I will try a flank advance instead.} e6 {Black will hold the center and also will keep open the a1-h8 highway. A future rupture on d5 is also a plan here. Everything is most normal so far (to our level I mean)} 7. O-O Nge7 {Again, not blocking the bishop and at the same time supporting ...d5.} 8. f4 O-O 9. Be3 {Maybe 9.g4 would have been more aggressive and might have saved a time, but Be3 is a strong move, since is both aiming c5 and also allowing Qd2 with the corresponding attack on the fianchetto.} Nd4 {Black goes for a classical plan here, since it can support now the strong Nd4 with his tween after N7c6.} 10. g4 Nec6 {And there it goes. On the other hand , after white showing off his hand, maybe N on e7 would have been an excellent defensive piece.} 11. Ng3 {Avoiding the exchange and adding the N onto the attack.} Nb4 {Golden rule in chess: When being attacked on one flank, counterattack (if possible on the center). It also seems to leave defence somehow weakened, but seems alright to me.} 12. Rc1 Qb6 {Now this clearly starts looking like a race on the flanks. Black is not only betting on his Q side, but also keeping control of the center.} 13. f5 {To keep with the plan.} Bd7 {Now this is a mistake, since black does not compensate for the loss of activity on his DSB. And yet, my opponent pushed me a lot to show the tactical advantage white gained after movement 15.} 14. f6 Bh8 15. g5 Nbc6 {Threatening b2. It may be the nervous situation emerging from a recently gained advantage, but I started to feel compressed here. White needs to measure his next moves careful in order not to lose control of the flank.} 16. b3 {Although it weakens c3, I thought it was the best, since now I can try h4 and then, slowly, shift my pieces towards the center and the Q'flank. Black will not help me, though.} Qa5 {Aa I said, now c3 is a weak spot. On the other hand, white has now the chance to expel BN on d4 if c3 is eventually allowed. White needs to exploit the narrow position black has on that area, not forgetting to try something on the BK castling though.} 17. Bd2 { Sad and slow it seems, but I didn't feel like giving up on my a2 with the interesting Na4-Nb2.} Qa3 {Now, as mentioned before, black will start pushing on the flank, exploiting the fact that white pieces are poorly coordinated there, including WB on g2. But then, black is moving pieces away from the castling, which makes me think about trying something there. The mate with N on h6 seems impossible, but then maybe something with the rook... Question is... would it be worth trying the advance h4? Or perhaps , since black has not advanced e5, Rf4 is the appropriate move?} 18. Rf4 {I opted for the latter. This is a risky commitment, since, once on the "h" file, the rook will be of no support to the Queen's flank, and after ...e5, black can cut off any reinforcements white will like to bring onto the castling area.} Rac8 {But it seems Black is more interesting on pushing on the other flank. I thought ...e5 was going to be the move. I guess in case of ...e5, black will have to give up on the center. That (not giving up on the center) may also explain why it was Ra and not Rfa8 played.} 19. Rh4 Ne5 {With the idea of pushing on c4, and also a double control of f6 is a threatening dagger on my throat there. Hence, I decided to exchange one of such active knights.} 20. Bf4 {Ne5 seems to be the right one, since is closer to the castling and also, as said, helping on c4 control. Moreover, it cannot retire without losing the pawn on d3 and in case of Bxe5, dxe5, LSB will also have his c8-h3 blocked and therefore, white can bring some firepower onto that flank to exploit BK weakened castling.} b5 {Nd-c6 was the other alternative, but then the c file is blocked.} 21. Bxe5 dxe5 {A much more appealing position for white now presents on the castling flank. On the other hand, BQ is pointing to Rc1 and hence, Qg4 cannot be played immediately.} 22. Rh3 {Making room for the queen to go to h4 and also, in case no attacking plan on the castling comes into my mind, the 3 rank is now indirectly defended by Rh3.} a5 {An all-out advance. But Queen is trapped, although not much danger awaits her. Check white position and see how constricted it is now} 23. Rb1 {It took me a long time to figure out this (I think is the best) move, since it was so simple I didn't see it, as obsessed I was with leaving that rook undefended. As simple as it is, I feel like it was one, if not THE one, best moves I made. It gives me exactly the times I need to make the final attack.} c4 {And here comes the race! It is an extremely interesting ending. I couldn't calculate the outcome of it. I even thought about black trying something like Nf5 (later) to quench off white's attack.} 24. Qg4 cxb3 25. Qh4 h5 {Now it comes one of my last doubts. Could I continue with the quieter 26.axb3 or shall I go for straight for Nh5? I though that after axb3, Nf5 would have caused me much trouble (not that I went deep in the analysis of it though)} 26. Nxh5 {So Nxh5 it is then!} bxc2 {An interesting ending. I tried to calculate the most possible variants here, and sometimes I came with black having an ace under the sleeve and other times I couldn't find a way out for black. Calm was not on my "things to do" list. But everything seemed under control y played cautiously. } 27. Ng3 {A must, to defend on f1.} cxb1=Q+ 28. Nxb1 Rc1+ {The most adequate.} 29. Nf1 {Bc1 would have lost the game, after Nf3+} Rxf1+ 30. Bxf1 Nf3+ {Another forced sacrifice. I was't sure a few moves back whether I had enough time to bring my tower back to h. But then I found a solution.} 31. Rxf3 Qc5+ 32. Kh1 {And black surrendered. It was interesting that, after 32...Qc1, 33.Nd2! saved the day: it gives time for Rook to go back to h3 and at the same time is defending f1. A nice deviation sacrifice (in case I had the chance to use it). Fantastic two games played against my opponent here, including that miniature he made out of my careless development previously posted. Hope you have enjoyed both!}
