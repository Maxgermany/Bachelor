1. e4 {I was rummaging through an old storage box today (9/15/07) and I found some of my original annotations.  Accordingly, I am revisiting some of the games I have placed here and updating them with where appropriate with some of my earlier thoughts.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {I probably would have headed into the poison pawn varations but it seems Richard had other ideas.} 5. Bd3 {More common (at least then) is Nc3.} Nc6 6. Be3 Ng4 7. Nxc6 {This seems inconsistent with his sixth move.  Qd2 may be a more logical continuation.} bxc6 8. O-O {White seems willing to accept doubled doubled pawns on the King file in exchange for an open file near Black's King.  I do not like the open file but the doubled pawns and Bishop pair seemed like a fair exchange.  Besides, my Knight can be easily forced from this post.  I don't like to waste time withdrawing. So.......} Nxe3 9. fxe3 Qb6 {Attacking both the e3 and b2 pawns.} 10. Qf3 Be6 11. b3 g6 {As White had addressed the threat on both pawns, this move seemed to offer a good way to develop my King's Bishop and prepare for Kingside castling.} 12. Nd2 Bg7 13. Rad1 d5 {Although not the worst, this is not the best move I have ever made.} 14. exd5 cxd5 15. Rf2 O-O 16. e4 {Certainly not White's best move.  White has opened a square from which the King's Bishop now attacks.  16. Raf1 increasing pressure on the open file is more in line with White previous moves.} Bd4 17. Rdf1 Bxf2+ 18. Rxf2 dxe4 19. Bxe4 Rad8 {Thus far White's 16th move pawn advance has netted him the loss of the exchange and a d2 Knight that is under attack.} 20. Qe2 Rfe8 {Much better was 19. -----, Rd6.  I just wasted a tempo.} 21. c4 Rd6 22. Kf1 {22. h3 is probably better.} Red8 23. Nf3 Bg4 24. Bd5 {Played to prevent Rd1 check.  Better is Bc2 when at least White could salvage a somewhat playable game:  24. Bc2, Rd2; 25. QxR, RxQ; 26. NxR (the Knight is no longer pinned).} e6 {White resigns.  Black's latest pin now leaves White faced with the loss of more material and he is already the exchange down.}
