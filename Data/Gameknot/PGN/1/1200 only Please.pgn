1. Nf3 {1.Nf3 is a cautious opening and trying to gauge what black is gonna do. Some move order tricks to get into an open sicilian or others can be employed. I was thinking this might head into an English opening so i play my pet reply. } d6 {...depending on what white does next, i have the annoying option for white of Bg4, or the quick development approach of e5 and then f5...} 2. Nc3 e5 3. e4 f5 4. d4 Be7 {..anticipating a quick exchange of queens where black is sometime better placed.} 5. dxe5 fxe4 6. Nxe4 Bg4 {..necessary otherwise white just wins a pawn.} 7. Be2 Bxf3 8. Bxf3 Nc6 9. e6 {...bit awkward here now for Black...but keep developing...} Nf6 10. O-O Nxe4 11. Bxe4 O-O 12. Re1 {..the pawn is a long term problem already and i have to try and get rid of it.} Qc8 13. Bd5 Rf6 {..this is a mistake trying to win the pawn by force....totally overlooked the pin that follows and i.....} 14. Bxc6 bxc6 15. Bg5 {...now have to give up the exchange...} Qf8 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 17. Qe2 Qe7 {...this is large problem for black and need to find things to conteract ....white just needs to be solid ...protect the pawns and drive home the advantage} 18. c3 Rb8 19. Qf3 c5 20. Re2 Be5 21. Qg4 {...white is moving to the right square...f4 is threatened and Rae1 might be coming soon...} Rf8 22. g3 c6 {...could play h5 here instead just to get rid of that dangerous pawn....but f4 killed that idea...} 23. f4 Bf6 24. f5 d5 {...white is comfy in this position and just needs to keep shoring things up...pushing the pawns to give a bit of space for the Queen.} 25. h4 {...longer term eventual g5 would be a real headache...} d4 26. c4 Rb8 27. Rb1 a5 28. Qf3 Rc8 29. Qa3 Ra8 {...black is simply defending...i have no real opportunity to threaten..all pieces are tied down...I think white just needs to continue to edge forward....} 30. b4 {...i think g4 is better, threatening g5...} cxb4 31. Qa4 {...now i can give my Bishop a bit of space......with} Qc5 {...threat is now d3  winning the piece, winning the pawn on c4 or f5. Blacks bishop will come to e7. So most likely would be d3 followed by Qxf5. Qxc4 will create problems with Rc2 and i think a winning attack is not far away for White. So at best i was thinking smoke and mirrors time and expect Kg2 and just take the f pawn and expect Rbe1........but then......} 32. Qc2 {...it is said that games can turn on a single move and this unfortunately is one. White is now completely lost with this error. I have to assume the aim was to cover f5.  Simple combo wins Queen and 2 pawns, Black would be 4 pawns, a piece and exchange up. All forced...? 32...d3  followed by Kg2 dxc2, Rxc2 Qxf5, R2c1 Qxe6.  Black can now followwith Qg4 & Bxh4. } d3+ {White lost this game on a single move and resigned, seeing the probable damage.  This was my 20th game so now actually rated on Gameknot !!}
