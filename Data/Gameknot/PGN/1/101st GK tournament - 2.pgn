1. e4 {I decided to annotate my games of 101st tournament as part of analysis. Please feel free to comment me and point out any mistakes or inaccuracies. I'm sorry for any typos or lack of grammar knowledge in this annotation, English is not native language to me but I do my best. Thank you.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {Basically the only move here.} 4. d4 {Scotch opening. Or as GK opening database says "Four knights opening. Scotch variation". In this opening whites try to gain small positional advantage} exd4 5. Nxd4 Bb4 {Main line of blacks defense} 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. O-O Bxc3 {?! Actually doubtful move. Double c-pawns won't be weak, whites pawn center will be significantly enhanced by LS bishop and blacks have just given 2 bishops to whites. As long as position will most likely remain opened 2 bishops will give whites good stable advantage.} 9. bxc3 Qe7 10. Re1 d6 11. f4 {Standard attempt to capture space in center exploiting opposition of black queen to white rook.} Bg4 12. Qd2 Nd7 {? It's probably a blunder. Black knight has cut the black bishop off the camp and now it can be trapped since black knight doesn't have any tempo-winning moves.} 13. h3 Bh5 14. g4 Bg6 15. f5 Ne5 16. Qf2 {? Well, that's basically a mistake, that could cost quite a lot. The point is that I've moved my queen to f-file which undoubtedly will be opened after capture at g6. Actually quite stupid move and blacks could save their bishop by a simple answer 16... h6  Now if 17. fg?! fg 18. Qg3 Rf3 (18... Nf3?+ returns some material, but it seems rather weak, since blacks attack will weaken without a knight) with threat Qh4 so white will have to play precisely just not to lose in few moves. 19. Qg2 (19. Qh2? Qh4 with threat of Rxh3 followed by Nf3+) Qh4 20. Re3 Raf8 -+ white pieces are paralyzed, while black keep threats Rg3 and Rf2  Thus whites would have to refuse to capture the black bishop to maintain significant advantage (+/- black bishop will be off game basically), so i wouldn't definitely say that 16... h6 was a better choice. Sometimes it's better to go into mathematically worse variation, but giving some counter-play and practical chances to save/win the game. Let's say both 16... h6 and 16... Re8 deserve consideration (!?).} Rae8 {I've given my opinion about this move little above.} 17. Qg3 {Admission of a mistake at 16th move. Now after capture at g6 whites will have one crucial tempo.} d5 18. fxg6 fxg6 19. Bf4 {This move finishing development solves problem with hanging rook at e1. Position is technically won by white, with tiny practical chance for black somehow force perpetual check.} Qc5+ 20. Kh2 Qxc3 21. Bxe5 Rxe5 22. exd5 cxd5 {Another bitter blunder... Anyway thanks to my opponent for the game, and thanks everyone for reading my first annotation here.}
