1. d4 {I always fear seeing this move when I play black. My queen pawn theory is extremely weak and I get crushed by the big boys. } Nf6 {I always play Nf6 in hope (which is often the case) white plays 2. c4 which will allow me to turn into a hopeful benko gambit or the very least a benoni. } 2. c4 c5 3. Nf3 {I'm most unfamiliar with the decline with Nf3, but I'm not extremely off balance. } cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {I could have played a more tame move such as e6, but I try to stay out of a official book lines for the most part. let's make this tactical shall we? } 5. Nb5 d5 {And why not make sharpen the blade anymore? I should've played more conservatively, but I didn't realize I was playing a 2200 player until more than half way through the game. } 6. cxd5 Bc5 7. Nb5c3 O-O 8. e3 h6 {I'm not even certain to why I played this move...better perhaps is Bf5 } 9. Na3 Bf5 10. Nc4 Re8 11. a3 {Attempting to push my bishop backward to clear some central space } a5 12. Be2 Qc7 13. O-O Rd8 14. h3 Nc6 15. Re1 Ne4 16. Nb5 Qe7 17. Bf3 Qh4 {Attempting to stay aggressive, but feel desperate. I don't like my position much at all } 18. Qe2 Ne7 19. Bxe4 Bxe4 20. d6 {This move really seem to stump me. I didn't really think about the effectiveness of it as I was making the moves before it, but now I feel extremely compromised } Nf5 21. Bd2 Qg5 {Not sure what the best move is here, I'm leaning towards 21. ... b6. After the exchange of queens in a couple moves, I feel like white really took a solid leap in positional advantage } 22. Qg4 {I question this move too, I'm not sure if I should've been the one to trade queens with 22. ... Qxg4, but I should've avoided the option of trading queens altogether.  } Bc6 23. Qxg5 hxg5 24. a4 b6 25. Nxe5 Bxb5 26. axb5 Nxd6 27. Nc6 {I'm pretty unhappy with these trades. I'd rather have kept the bishop pair, but I couldn't figure a way to avoid losing the e5 pawn... } Rde8 28. Rec1 a4 {Still being down a pawn, I was cautious towards playing 28. ... Nxb5 29. Nxa5 f6 30. Nb3. I'd rather the following sequence } 29. Bb4 Bxb4 30. Nxb4 Nxb5 31. Nd5 Re6 32. Rc4 a3 33. Rb4 Ra5 34. bxa3 Nxa3 35. e4 {I wasn't sure why white didn't play Nxb6 } Kh7 {35. ... Nc2? 26. Rxa5 bxa5 27. Ra4 Nb4 28. Nxb4 Re4 29. Rxa5 Rxb4 30. Rxg5 } 36. f3 Nc2 37. Rxa5 Nxb4 38. Rb5 Nxd5 39. exd5 Rd6 {Here, I figured I'm lost. I only have about a minute left I believe compared to white's 4 minutes. I have doubled pawns and we each have a passed pawn, but white's is already closer to promoting.  } 40. Kf2 Kg6 41. Ke3 Kf5 42. Kd4 Kf4 43. Rb4 f6 44. Rb3 Kg3 45. f4+ Kxg2 46. fxg5 f5 47. Ke5 Rd8 48. Rb4 {1-0. 20 seconds left and I couldn't handle the stress anymore. Well played by white. }
