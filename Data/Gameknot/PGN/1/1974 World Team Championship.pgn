1. e4 {Mitford represented the Faeroe Islands, while Black [Sharif] represented Monaco.} e5 {Standard...} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {The "Quiet Game" -- but not this time!} Be7 {An unorthodox response. More aggressive is 3... N-KB3, pressuring White.} 4. d4 {Mitford turns up the heat.} exd4 {The natural recapture.} 5. c3 {Sacrificing to open lines.} dxc3 {Sharif says "Why not"?} 6. Qd5 {That's why not! Sharif resigns, as mate is threatened. What move sequence did he overlook that would have neutralized the threat -- and let him play on?}
