1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {I don't think this is really the best move in the world, but it isn't terrible} 3. d4 {Most common move here} Qe7 {!? This blocks in the DSB the rest of the way, as well as developing his queen too early.} 4. dxe5 dxe5 {And I already have a superior position.} 5. Bg5 Qb4+ {Too bad I didn't notice the fork} 6. c3 Qxb2 7. Nbd2 Qxc3 {Now I'm down by two pawns, but I have three pieces developed to his one.} 8. Bc4 Ne7 9. O-O f6 {!? Better would have been h6. This creates serious light square weaknesses.} 10. Be3 Nec6 {?! Probably not great, better might have been to continue development.} 11. Qb3 Qa5 {? This is just a mistake that he doesn't notice the attack on f7.} 12. Bf7+ Kd8 13. Nc4 {Attacks the queen and moves a piece closer to the BK} Qa6 14. Rad1+ {Should I have moved the other rook?} Bd6 {!? This loses a pawn. Better would have been Nd7.} 15. Nxd6 cxd6 16. Rxd6+ {And I've won one of my pawns back, plus I'm in a much superior position. I'd much rather be white than black here.} Ke7 17. Qd5 Rd8 {?? If I capture and he recaptures, then I can play Bc5+ and the only way black can get out of check is to block with his queen. } 18. Rxd8 Bg4 {He must have seen it one move too late} 19. Nxe5 {! If he recaptures then I can play Bg5#} Nxd8 {He sees this too, but makes the blunder he managed to avoid last move.} 20. Bc5+ Qd6 21. Qxd6# {And mate. I think I played pretty well this game but if you find an error please comment.}
