1. e4 {As we know, my favorite opening.} e5 {Nothing new.} 2. f4 {But, white plays the King's Gambit, which reversion will accept.} exf4 3. Nf3 {So, Boy develops.} g5 {And, reversion, fianchetto's his g pawn, whilst get a pawn chain which, I'm sure, is why he played this, as opposed to, 3...g6} 4. d4 {Opening up a line for his Bc1.} g4 {And, black hits his N.} 5. Bc4 {?? Developing another piece and preparing to castle.  But, this is white's first blunder, as reversion will win a piece for a pawn.  So, that when all is said and done, he'll be the equivalent to a piece down.  This is a time where one had to deviate from the General Opening Guidelines, so best was to retreat his Nf3.} gxf3 6. Qxf3 d5 {Now, it's reversions turn to open up the center and get his Bc8 ready to come out.} 7. Bxd5 {By gaining the pawn back, I believe that this has now tranposed into the Poison Pawn Variation, I believe.  The reason I'm not totally sure is that I don't the exact move on where that variation begins.  But, if it hasn't transposed, then it's the equivalent to that. } c6 {Gaining tempo, in the process, for something.  When, Boy retreats, reversion will exchange his weakest pawn for a center pawn, giving black better control of the center, in my opinion.} 8. Bb3 Qxd4 9. Bxf4 Nf6 {Hitting white's e4.} 10. Nd2 {Which Boy defends.} Bg4 {So, reversion reattacks, gaining more time.} 11. Qg3 Nbd7 {Which he uses to develop another piece.} 12. c3 {Now, Boy hits.} Qc5 {And, reversion defends.} 13. h3 {So, white reattacks.} Bh5 {Which black also defends. } 14. e5 {Once again, Boy hits Nf6, but this, however, pointless, in my opinion, because of black's next move.} Rg8 {And, black reattacks.  After retreating, this is where white will start to go wrong which is why I deem 14.e5 to be pointless.} 15. Qh2 Nxe5 {So, reversion takes.} 16. Bxe5 {?? And, Boy takes back, as it appears to equalize.  However, this loses, as now, reversion has a forced mate.} Qe3+ 17. Kf1 Be2+ 18. Ke1 Bf3+ 19. Kf1 Qe2+ 20. Kg1 Rxg2+ 21. Qxg2 Qxg2# {Although different the Damiano Defense (which I mentioned a little to a student), although it directly applies here.  When a stronger player gives things away, it could be a blunder, but more often then not, there is a good reason.  By taking, you are potentially setting yourself up for disaster.  This happened in one game where I would've faced ruinous loss of material but got greedy and attempted to take.  I figured that I won something back, but in doing so, my opponent was able to deliver mate.  Something similar happened against both dynamic_dv and Jack Stockel.  In both cases, I got greedy, took a pawn, and in doing so, they were able to win the Queen for free.  That forced me into resignation shortly after.  The same thing is true here, where white took and got mated. }
