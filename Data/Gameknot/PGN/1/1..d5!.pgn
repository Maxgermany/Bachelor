[Opening "QGD (D31), 3.Nc3"]

1. d4 {Hi, my name is Fred McGriff and I am a retired professional baseball player.} d5 {Typically when my opponent opens with the queen's pawn I panic, yank the plug from my computer, and rock back and forth huddled in the corner of my closet.  But since this is tenfingers, my nemesis, I dig deep and answer three days later with a well-thought-out d5.  I'm pretty sure it's a force from here but he chooses to play on:} 2. c4 {queen's gambit....} e6 {DECLINED!!  after my 1..d5! the rest is style points, and denying the gambit that he begged me for, whilst merciless, feels awfully good.  I'm 4-7-1 lifetime against tenfingers and am currently frothing at the mouth as 5-7-1 is but one move closer.} 3. Nc3 {He moves a sulky donkey to c3 in a weak attempt to regain compusure after such an embarrassing rejection} Bb4 {well, sulky donkey, now you're stuck.} 4. Nf3 {TWO sulky donkeys.} Bxc3+ {With this move I shred my opponent's hopes of having any semblance of a pawn structure.  I must be playing downwind because supple fumes of victory waft my way} 5. bxc3 {I'm scratching my head here wondering why he hasn't yet issued his resignation.  is it not insulting to play on with doubled pawns?} Nf6 {I threaten to castle kingside, and rest assured this is no empty threat.} 6. Bg5 {Wow, nice move tenfingers, what are you like a five time dean's lister at the Fred McGriff School of Chess all the sudden?  Where have I seen this move before?} Nc6 {Well this is how I answer.  I'm just going to develop and ignore.} 7. e3 O-O {I castle and ignore.  An inkling of h6 crossed my mind but I feel there is no need to force any spilt blood on f6 just yet.  My queen munches on an apple and watches with disinterest.} 8. cxd5 {attacking d5 is wise here.  my queen drops her apple and now has two things to think about.} exd5 9. Qb3 {things are heating up at d5 as well as f6...} Na5 {I weaken my donkey here just to put some pressure on that white Q, maybe I can knock her around and develop some pieces at the same time} 10. Qb5 c6 {develop, protect the donkey and threaten the Q } 11. Bxf6 {but I am doomed to doubled pawns... and wait where did his go?  the tables are turning and I don't like it.  I'm suddenly overcome by a strong whiff of dead donkey.} gxf6 12. Qb4 Bg4 {the plan now is to be aggressive and try to plug up the hole I've made on the g file} 13. Be2 Re8 {some breathing room for my king} 14. h3 {I definitely do not want to exchange pieces here, I want to draw out his pawns and weaken his pawn protection for the potential O-O} Bf5 15. g4 Be4 {In the rarest turn of events, things have actually gone as planned, and I've accomplished two things: though I still feel exposed on the g file like an undone fly on a brisk autumn day, I've drawn his pawns out enough to limit threat over there, especially from his white bishop.  Also, a kingside castle on his part just seems a bit shakier now.} 16. O-O {Good.  This is what I wanted.  Now it's time to go to work and exploit. } Nc4 {With a single glorious leap, my donkey glides through the air twenty or thirty feet above the white queen, his silky black mane shimmering in the sun, his uncoiled haunches stretched out majestically as he cuts knifelike through high-altitude wind; below, a confused queen witnesses but a shadow streak across the battlefield, quiet, black, and ninjalike.} 17. Kg2 {Having witnessed such a ridiculous display of power, the king panics and makes a premature run for it.} Bxf3+ {Check!  I love how check is always in yellow with an exclamation point.  It's almost as damaging to the psyche as a conditional move.} 18. Bxf3 Nd2 {I'm totally willing to trade a (superpowered) donkey for a bishop here and flush that king out some more} 19. Rfd1 Nxf3 20. Kxf3 b5 {I want to make a little pawn canopy for his queen because I think that it would look pretty neat if he nestled his queen all up in the canopy.} 21. Qc5 {and it does indeed look pretty neat.} Qc7 {Starving for aciton, my queen has her eye on those pawns over by his king.  She's gonna go get herself a piece.} 22. h4 Qh2 23. Qxc6 {The pawn canopy is no longer totally sweet looking :(} Qh3+ {Rather than Qxh4, I can likely force his king to e2 and take out both pawns} 24. Ke2 {done} Qxg4+ {and done} 25. Ke1 Qxh4 {while not originally planned, I now see that I have the threat of Rxe3 which could be devastating} 26. Qxd5 {he evens the score but neglects the business I'm about to take care of.  } Rxe3+ {My rook powerslides imposingly and no doubt startles my opponent.} 27. Kd2 {Flustered, tenfingers chooses instant death with Kd2. one wonders the outcome had he chosen kf1.   } Qxf2+ {I move to 5-7-1 against tenfingers and execute a flawless series of backflips.  Clearly he did not play to his potential in this game and never fully recovered from 1..d5! but I take what I can get and will try to enjoy myself until the next challenge...}
