1. e4 e6 2. d4 {This is the french defense a very hard nut to crack. Black is going to get a counter attack no matter what line you play! I decided to annotate this game because this is one of the most interest French games I had played up until this time and it will be very instructive and exciting for anyone wanting to learn a line against the French. Hold on it going to be wild and bumpy ride!} d5 {You can move the pawn to 3.e5 and go into the advance variation but player who play the French are all very booked up on that variations so I challenged myself and play the razor sharp Winawer variation 3.Nc3 ..Bb4 !} 3. Nc3 Bb4 {3.. Bb4 the only move to put immediate pressure on whites position. You are going to have to know a  little opening chess theory to play this line. I hope I can help you with that lets proceed.} 4. e5 {4. e5 white is force to play this move and we enter the super sharp Winawer variation of the French. Black will then play c5 stepping up the pressure on the pinned knight on Nc3.} c5 5. Bd2 {5. Bd2 is my recommended variation .Yes black will win the d4 pawn but he is in for a wild ride .Let see} cxd4 6. Nb5 {6.Nb5 and now the pawn on d4 is attacked and we have a little discover attack against the bishop at b4. The bishop capturing on d2 doesn't solve blacks problems. If he goes for the super aggressive ...6 Qa5 ?? then 7.Nd6+ check is a big problem . Capture the knight with ..Bxd6 loses the Queen on a5 and we don't want to do that if your black. Moving the King loses the right to castle and wins a free piece either the bishop at c8  or the rook at h8 depending on where the King moves!. My  oh mine what has black got himself into so now you will understand his next move a little better.} Bc5 {..Bc5 is the correct for black holding on to the central d4 pawn. Nd6 check would now lose a pawn for white  and activate blacks Queen. 7 Qg4 continues the attack on the g7 pawn that unprotected.`} 7. Qg4 {}
