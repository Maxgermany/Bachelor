1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 6. Bg5 {The Richter-Rauzer attack against the Sicilian is probably the most common variation of the open Sicilian.} Bd7 {Black does not need fear Bg5xNf6. Black has enough compensation in the two bishops and open g file} 7. Bc4 {This is almost mixing two systems. 6.Bc4 is the Sozin. 6.Qd2 is more common.} Rc8 8. Bb3 Qb6 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 {The exchange of knights on c6 helps black - more central squares are covered by black's pawns.} 11. Qd2 Rg8 {and now black starts to make use of that open g file} 12. g3 Bg4 {Making queen side castling hard, but the white king is hardly safe on the king side.} 13. O-O h5 14. Rae1 Qc5 15. Kg2 h4 16. Qf4 Qh5 {There is of course the big threat of Bh6 here, checkmating white's queen!} 17. h3 {now Bh6 is met by hxg4 counter-attacking black's queen.} hxg3 18. hxg4 Rxg4 19. Qd2 Bh6 20. Rfh1 {Black's attack forces white to part with material} Bxd2 21. Rxh5 Bxe1 22. Rh8+ Kd7 23. Rxc8 Kxc8 24. fxg3 Rxg3+ 25. Kh2 Re3 {More material is lost for white. The rook is just so much better than the knight in this position. Not a wonderful game, but the only time I have beaten a player graded over 1900, not counting time-outs and defaults. I am sure we both made mistakes - it was only a ten minute games. Your comments would be welcome!}
