[Opening "Caro-Kann (B13), exchange, Rubinstein variation"]

1. e4 c6 {I chose the Caro-Kann opening because it develops a flank attack, gives black a good pawn structure, often with a central pawn majority, and it does not require much theoretical knowledge to play. I chose to annotate this game because of how simply the game developed, with no major mistakes by white, and no majorly brilliant moves by black, to give black a clear and easy win. } 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 {The exchange variation. This gives black a central pawn majority.} 4. Bd3 Nc6 5. c3 Nf6 6. h3 {White played the opening quite effectively. Usually black develops his light squared bishop on the king's side, but white has made this impossible. His centrally fianchettoed light-squared bishop looks strong. } e6 {Allowing for the development of the dark-squared bishop. Since white has already constricted the light-square bishop on the king side, it is no great loss to block it in.} 7. Nf3 Bd6 {I also wanted a centrally fianchettoed bishop!} 8. O-O h6 {Stopping Bg5} 9. Be3 O-O 10. Qc2 {White begins to contest the c-file, but it would have been better to develop the knight first.} b6 {I was considering the fianchetto...} 11. Nbd2 {White develops the knight, but the queen is awkwardly placed. She prefers the square presently occupied by the knight.} Bd7 {I decided against the fianchetto because I saw no way of clearing the diagonal in the near future.} 12. c4 dxc4 {And so white obliges by opening the diagonal, when it is no longer useful for black. This exchange opens the c-file for white, but is it really worth it, considering that black castled king-side?} 13. Nxc4 Qc7 {Unlike white, this square is a natural position for the black queen.} 14. Nxd6 Qxd6 15. Rac1 {Adding pressure on the c-file, but it is easily averted...} Rac8 16. Qd2 {A better square for the white queen, in my opinion.} Nb4 {I'm not sure what I was thinking with this move, but it turned out to be the match-winning move. I suppose I guessed that white would exchange the rooks, leaving black in control of the c-file.} 17. Rxc8 Rxc8 {Black temporarily has control of the c file} 18. Rc1 {Another rook exchange is in the offing. White will gain control of the c-file with the queen, but at a large price. He will lose his bishop.} Rxc1+ 19. Qxc1 Nxd3 {From now on, white is behind} 20. Qc3 {Threatening the knight, and holding onto the redundant c-file.} Bb5 {I prefer to keep the knight there. It is an annoying place for white.} 21. a3 {I'm not sure the purpose behind this move.} Nd5 {Trying to gain tempo on the white queen, but I also got the idea at this point that my best plan was to exchange off the major pieces and be left with material advantage in the end game.} 22. Qd2 {Again a good square for white's queen. Queen and bishop in unison could have developed a threat on the black king earlier on, but the fruitless contest for the c-file prevented this. Best to remove the threat now.} Nxe3 {and start exchanging off pieces.} 23. fxe3 Qg3 {There was no real threat here, but the appearance of a threat could be useful.} 24. b3 {Perhaps wanting to kick out the light square bishop one day, and attack the knight.} e5 {Continuing with the plan to exchange off pieces.} 25. dxe5 Nxe5 26. Nxe5 Qxe5 27. Qd4 {And white obliges} Qxd4 28. exd4 {At this point black should win the game.} Bc6 {Preventing the advance of the central pawn} 29. Kf2 {Off to assist the central pawn, but black will reach there in time to defend.} Kf8 30. g3 {The advantage of the light square bishop at work. White has to waste a move putting the pawn out of danger before moving his king to the centre. c6 is a pivotal square for the light-square bishop, threatening the pawn groups on both sides of the board.} Ke7 31. Ke3 Kd6 32. b4 Bg2 {This move is intended to prompt the h3 pawn forward to give black's pawns scope to attack.} 33. h4 g5 34. hxg5 hxg5 35. Kf2 Bc6 36. Ke3 Kd5 {White was playing for a draw, but careful play by black wins the game.} 37. Kd3 Bd7 38. Ke3 f5 39. Kd3 f4 40. gxf4 gxf4 41. Ke2 Kxd4 42. Kf3 Ke5 43. Kf2 Ke4 44. Ke2 f3+ 45. Kf2 Bc6 {Now I want to expend time to force the white king to move. This square gives the white king the opportunity to move to f1, where a check mate is possible.} 46. Kf1 {And mate beckons.} Ke3 47. Ke1 f2+ {From here, white king should move to d1 if he wants to prolong the game. Evidently he does, since he has not resigned.} 48. Kf1 {Checkmate in 3 moves...} Kf3 49. a4 Bxa4 {Which white avoids be resigning.}
