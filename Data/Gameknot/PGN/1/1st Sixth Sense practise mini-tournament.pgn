1. e4 {My dear friend Elena has asked me to annotate this game for her. So I do so!} c5 {Black decides on the Sicilian Defence!} 2. d3 {White opts for a closed version of it. I think this move rather lacks bite. } Nc6 {Black develops sensibly} 3. Be3 {As does white} e6 {This is quite sound too} 4. Nf3 {Sound development, but again rather lacking bite. What is White's plan exactly here?} d6 {After White's rather unambitious opening, I would have been tempted to try d7-d5 instead here.} 5. Nc3 {White continues to develop.} Nf6 {As does Black.} 6. Be2 {Sensible development again!} d5 {This rather wastes a move. If Black wanted to play this, she could have played d7-d5 in one move rather than two. Still it threatens d5-d4, so White has to do something about this threat.} 7. exd5 {So White takes.} exd5 {Black takes back.} 8. Bd2 {This again is very passive. Bg5 was far more active. Maybe d3-d4 could have been played too. This leaves Black with a comfortable space advantage.} Be7 {So Black develops} 9. O-O {White castles} O-O {As does Black} 10. Re1 {Another sensible move, moving the rook to the open file.} a6 {Is she preparing b7-b5 taking space on the queen side?} 11. Nb1 {I fins this slightly odd too. White is planning c3 and d3-d4 after all. But the point is, she could have played d3-d4 earlier, under more favourable circumstances.} Qd6 {Moves the queen forward.} 12. c3 {White carries on with the plan.} d4 {But Black prevents the plan from being carried out. This is a fine move by the Italian player!} 13. cxd4 {White takes.} Nxd4 {Black correctly takes back with the knight. Taking back with the pawn was possible and gives a slight edge to Black, in terms of more space controlled. This is better though, it makes it a lot easier to attack the weak White pawn on d3, along the semi-open d file.} 14. Nc3 {This is a mistake, allowing Black to get two bishops in an open position. Nxd4 Qxd4 15. Bc3 Qh4 16. Nd2 Nd5 17. Be5 Nf4 18. g3 Nh3+ 19. Kf1 Qg5 20. f4 Qg6 21. Nc4 Bf5 22. Rc1 was better.} Nxe2+ {So Black takes the bishop} 15. Rxe2 {White recaptures.} Re8 {Black mobilises her rook. Now that the Bishop on e7 is protected by the rook, Black is threatening the pawn on d3 with the queen. Qxd3 immediately loses to Rxe7!} 16. Re3 {As does White, protecting d3 at the same time.} Bd8 {This is a mistake. I can't see why Black can't just win a pawn here with Ng4. Post match computer analysis (PMCA) gives b5 17. Qc2 Bb7 18. h3 Nd5 19. Nxd5 Bxd5 20. Rae1 Qd7 21. b3 Bd6 22. Ne5 Qf5 23. Bc3 as the best for both sides.} 17. Qe1 {PMCA gives this as a blunder too. Rxe8+ Nxe8 18. Ne4 Qd5 19. Qc2 Bf5 20. Re1 Bb6 21. Nxc5 Bxc5 22. Re5 Bxf2+ 23. Kxf2 Qd7 24. Re3 Nf6 25. Ne5 is given as better.} Bd7 {Black at last develops the Bc8 and also protects the Re8 which is doubly attacked.} 18. Re2 {PMCA gives this as a blunder and suggests 18. Rxe8+ Bxe8 19. Qe5 Qxd3 20. Qxc5 Bc6 21. Qe3 Qxe3 22. Bxe3 Bc7 23. Nd4 Bd7 24. Bg5 Ng4 25. h3 Be5. I can't see why Black can't just take on d3 now, however...} Bc6 {This looks good too, putting the bishop on a fine diagonal.} 19. Bg5 {19. Rxe8+ Bxe8 20. Qe5 Qxd3 21. Qxc5 Bc6 22. Qe3 Qxe3 23. Bxe3 Bc7 24. Nd4 Bd7 25. Bg5 Ng4 26. h3 Be5 is given as better by PMCA} Bc7 {Black connects her rooks and is now threatening to take on f3 followed by Qxh2. Black has a great advantage.} 20. Bxf6 {White takes.} Qxf6 {But this is a blunder by Black. PMCA gives â€¦ Rxe2 21. Qxe2 Bxf3 22. Be5 Qxe5 23. Qxe5 Bxe5 24. gxf3 Re8 25. Kg2 Bd4 26. Rh1 h6 27. a4 Rd8 28. Rc1 Be5 as best, but as Black I would have been tempted to play 20....B(c6) x N(f3) immediately } 21. Nd5 {This is a very clever move. If Black plays B(c6)xN(d5) then White can mate in two starting with R(e2)xR(e8) } Qd6 {Black also has to protect Bc7} 22. Nxc7 {White takes now} Qxc7 {Black takes back} 23. Rc1 {White mobilises her other rook. } Rxe2 {Black takes} 24. Qxe2 {White takes back} Re8 {Black hits the queen} 25. Qd1 {Queen drops back, keeping a protection on Nf3} Qf4 {Black advances her queen} 26. Rxc5 {White takes.} Bxf3 {This seems to me o be the obvious move, but PMCA gives it as a mistake and suggests Qb4 27. Re5 Qxb2 28. Rxe8+ Bxe8 29. Qd2 Qb1+ 30. Qe1 Qxe1+ 31. Nxe1 Kf8 32. d4 Ke7 33. Nd3 Bc6 34. Nf4 Kd6 35. Nh5 g6 36. Nf6 h6 as the best continuation for Black.} 27. gxf3 {White's king side pawns are now split, but Black has to be careful as her own back rank is weak, for example if Re8-e6?? Rc5-c8 mating!} Qb4 {With a double attack on the Rc5 and also threatening Re1 forking king and queen.} 28. Rc1 {So the rook drops back, and White's pawns start to drop. PMCA gives 28. Qc2 h6 29. Rc8 Rxc8 30. Qxc8+ Kh7 31. Qf5+ Kg8 32. Qe5 Qa4 33. Kg2 Qxa2 34. Qe8+ Kh7 35. Qe4+ g6 36. Qxb7 Kg7 37. d4 as a better alternative, but not many players would allow checks on e1.} Qxb2 {So one pawn goes} 29. Kg2 {This doesn't seem to achieve much. PMCA gives 29. Rb1 Qxa2 30. Rxb7 Qd5 31. Ra7 Qg5+ 32. Kf1 Qh6 33. Kg2 Qg6+ 34. Kf1 Qh5 as better. At least White's deficit is held to just one pawn in this line! Another way to save the second pawn would have been Rc1-c2} Qxa2 {Losing a second pawn makes things hard for White} 30. Rc2 {White hits the queen, but only to drive it to a better square} Qd5 {It is nicely centralised here, ready for action on either side of the board.} 31. Qc1 {White just gives up a third pawn without a fight. PMCA gives 31. d4 b5 32. Re2 Rxe2 33. Qxe2 Kf8 34. Qc2 Qd6 35. Qxh7 Qxd4 36. Qc2 Qf6 37. Qc8+ Ke7 38. Qg4 Kd8 as better.} Qxd3 {So white takes.} 32. Rc8 {This is the best counter-attacking hope.} Rd8 {Now Black blunders, and gives up the advantage she has carefully secured. Qg6+ 33. Kh1 Qe6 34. Rc4 Qh3 35. Qd1 b5 36. Re4 Ra8 37. Re5 Qh4 38. Qd7 Rf8 39. Kg2 b4 40. Qc6 Qd4 41. Re7 is given as better by PMCA} 33. Qc7 {White cleverly attacks the rook again.} Rf8 {The rook seeks sanctuary.} 34. Qb8 {And White misses her big chance. She could have drawn with 34. Qc5 Rd8 35. Qc7 Qg6+ 36. Kh1 Qb1+ 37. Kg2 Qg6+} Qa3 {Qg6+ 35. Kh1 Qb1+ 36. Kg2 Qb4 37. Rxf8+ Qxf8 38. Qxb7 a5 39. Qc6 g6 40. Kg3 Qb8+ 41. Kg2 Qb4 is given as even better for White in the PMCA} 35. Qxb7 {White now starts to get the pawns back.} Rxc8 {Black takes.} 36. Qxc8+ {White takes back} Qf8 {Queen has to block} 37. Qxa6 {Now the second pawn goes, White has re-established material equality, and Black's advantage is minimal and based on the split pawns on the kingside. White should be able to draw this.} Qd8 {The queen improves her position} 38. f4 {White advances a pawn. As White I would be tempted to just sit on the position, play something like Q-c4-g4 maybe h2-h3 and just wait for Black to come at me. I think the White queen belongs on the kingside, protecting the king and pawns there.} g6 {So Black avoids unpleasant back rank threats.} 39. Kg3 {King advances} Kg7 {Black advances her king} 40. h4 {I am not sure what this achieves. Qe2 seems better to me.} Kh6 {Black wants to attack with the king supporting the queen.} 41. f3 {This is a very poor move. PMCA gives 41. Qb7 f6 42. Qe4 Qd7 43. Qf3 Qd6 44. Qe3 Qd1 45. Qe7 Qg1+ 46. Kh3 Qf1+ 47. Kg3 Qd3+ 48. Qe3 Qd6 49. Qe8 as better, but I like simply 41. Qe2 preventing the Black king from advancing. I don't see how Black can then make any more progress.} Kh5 {Now Black starts to win pawns again.} 42. Qb5+ {White throws in a check, no doubt hoping for Kh6?? allowing Qg5!! and a draw. However Black has better.} f5 {Now the h pawn is doomed, and so is White.} 43. Qe5 {Probably best, otherwise the f4 pawn goes too.} Qxh4+ {So one pawn goes.} 44. Kg2 {Forced!} Qd8 {Queen goes back, ready to strike down the d file, or return to the kingside, as required} 45. Qg7 {White hits the h7 pawn.} h6 {Black protects.} 46. Kh3 {Another blunder, another pawn goes. PMCA gives 41. Qb7 f6 42. Qe4 Qd7 43. Qf3 Qd6 44. Qe3 Qd1 45. Qe7 Qg1+ 46. Kh3 Qf1+ 47. Kg3 Qd3+ 48. Qe3 Qd6 49. Qe8, although I would have probably played Qe5} Qh4+ {So queen checks} 47. Kg2 {Forced again} Qxf4 {Another pawn goes.} 48. Qa1 {Queen retreats} Qd2+ {Queen check} 49. Kh3 {King up} Qe2 {Black attacks the pawn.} 50. Qh1 {This is given as another mistake, and PMCA suggests 50. Kg3 g5 51. Qh1+ Kg6 52. Qb1 Qe6 53. Qb7 h5 54. Qb1 h4+ 55. Kf2 Qd5 56. Qb8 Qe6 57. Qb1} f4 {White has no sensible moves, and has the unenviable choice between losing a third pawn or allowing a queen exchange into a hopeless ending.} 51. Qg2 {White allows the queen exchange.} Qxg2+ {Black takes and White finally gives up. Many thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it. Don't forget to rate it on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!}
