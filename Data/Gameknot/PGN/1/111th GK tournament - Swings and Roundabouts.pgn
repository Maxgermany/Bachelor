1. c4 {This was a tournament game against a player around 200 points higher. In the middle game white has a strong attack but black defends valiantly and makes a come back as you will see.  We start with the English opening} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. d4 {This is where we depart from the Gameknot database which prefers Bg2n in preparation for castling.} e6 7. Bg2 b6 {According to the computer analysis this is the first inaccuracy, it prefers … Nc6 8. O-O Re8 9. Re1 h6 10. Rb1 g5 11. h3 e5 12. d5 Nb4} 8. O-O Bb7 9. e5 dxe5 10. dxe5 Nfd7 11. Bg5 Qe8 12. Re1 {lining up against the black queen.} Bxf3 {I must admit this was a bit of a suprise, the computer calls it an inaccuracy and prefers … h6 13. Bf4 Qe7 14. h4 Rd8 15. Qe2 Nc6 16. Red1 Nc5} 13. Qxf3 {The recapture adds to the pressure on f6 and I have the option of bringing my knight to e4 to add to that pressure, around this point I start to form a plan which ideally involves my knight on f6 and my queen on h somewhere} c6 14. Qf4 {Analysis says that this is the first mistake of the game preferring 14. Bf4 g5 15. Bxg5 Nxe5 16. Qe4 Na6 17. Red1 f5 18. Qh4 Rf7 19. Rd6 Rd7 20. Rxd7 Qxd7 21. Be7  This move however is consistent with my plan as well as adding support to the e5 pawn} Nc5 15. b4 {I managed to completely over look the forthcoming fork} Nd3 16. Qh4 Nxe1 17. Rxe1 a5 {I think this is an attempt to free some space, black appears to be in a little bit of a bind} 18. Ne4 {I continue with my plan} Bxe5 {The computer calls this a blunder due to  … Bxe5 19. Bf6 Nd7 20. Bxe5 Qd8 21. Qh6 Nxe5 22. Ng5 Re8 23. Qxh7+ Kf8 24. Qh8+ Ke7 25. Qxe5 Qd7 26. Qg7 Kd8 27. Nxf7+ Kc8 28. Qxg6 axb4 } 19. Nf6+ {I was in two minds whether to move Bf6 or Nf6, one of the reasons I chose this was that it seemed to me to be more forcing however the computer calls this a mistake due to  19. Nf6+ Bxf6 20. Bxf6 Nd7 21. Bxc6 h5 22. Qg5 Kh7 23. Qb5 axb4 24. Bxd7 Qb8 25. Qxb4 Qb7 26. Bb5 Qf3 27. Bd4 Rfb8 28. a4 g5  it prefers 19. Bf6 Nd7 20. Bxe5 Qd8 21. Qh6 Nxe5 22. Ng5 Re8 23. Qxh7+ Kf8 24. Qh8+ Ke7 25. Qxe5 Qd7 26. Qg7 Kd8 27. Nxf7+ Kc8 28. Qxg6 axb4} Bxf6 20. Bxf6 {I this point I thought I had a won game however black had different ideas} h5 {The analysis says -  Blunder: +8.97 » … h5 21. Re5 Qd7 22. Bf3 Qd8 23. Bxd8 Nd7 24. Rxh5 gxh5 25. Qg5+ Kh7 26. Qxh5+ Kg7 27. Be7 axb4 28. Bxc6 Nc5 29. Bxa8 Rxa8 30. Bf6+ Kxf6 Best: +3.17 » … Nd7 21. Bxc6 Nxf6 22. Bxe8 Nxe8 23. c5 bxc5 24. bxc5 Nc7 25. Kg2 Rfb8 26. Qa4 Nd5 27. c6 Rb4 28. Qa3 Rc8 29. Rc1} 21. Re5 Qd7 22. Bf3 {This was a multi purpose move, firstly it prevented a black queen incursion on d1, it also threatens a Bxh3 sacrifice to open the black king and last but not least it clears a little bolt hole for my king. At this point I was still fairly confident.} Qd3 {slightly frustratingly for me the analysis shows this as a mate in 10 which of course I didn't forsee  Blunder: +Mate(10) » … Qd3 23. Rxh5 gxh5 24. Bxh5 Qb1+ 25. Kg2 Nd7 26. Qg5+ Qg6 27. Bxg6 Nxf6 28. Be4+ Kh8 29. Qxf6+ Kg8 30. Qg5+ Kh8 31. Qh6+ Kg8 32. Qh7#  When I was trying to analyse the possibilities, I could see that the black queen could end up on g6 but I couldn't see how to get around that so I planned to try to get the black queen off the b1-h7 diagonal} 23. Kg2 {It's funny how one move can throw a position away and this is apparently it, instead of protecting the bishop I should probably have played Bxh5 as then gxh5 looks fairly dangerous for black. Although analysis calls this a blunder as the mate in 10 is still on.} Nd7 24. Rxh5 gxh5 25. Be4 {aimed at keeping the black queen off that diagonal} Qxe4+ {The computer calls this a mistake but I think it was carefully calculated as after the oncoming sequence of exchanges, black was still ahead on material. I was a little frustrated with this move as I felt I should have been able to get a little more out of the position I was in.} 26. Qxe4 Nxf6 27. Qxc6 axb4 28. Qf3 Ng4 29. Qb3 {At this point the analysis has black quite far in front, I felt I had all but lost the game and decided I was going to take the opportunity to try to delay the inevitable as long as possible by harrassing black} Rfc8 30. h3 Ne5 31. Qxb4 Nxc4 32. a4 Rc6 33. Qb5 Na5 {analysis calls this a mistake preferring … Rc5 34. Qb4 Ra7 35. h4 Rac7 36. Kh3 Kg7} 34. Qxh5 {simply grabbing material in the hope I can take advantage and chase the black king a little} Rc5 35. Qg4+ Kf8 36. Qb4 Rb8 37. h4 {Passed pawns must be pushed} Kg7 38. Qg4+ Kf8 39. h5 f5 40. Qd4 {Around this point analysis has the score more or less equal and I was starting to hope I may be able to get near to promotion as long as I was careful, I had half an eye on Qf6} Ke7 41. Qg7+ Kd6 42. h6 Rc7 43. Qd4+ Kc6 44. Qe5 {Pinning the rook on c7 with a view to advancing my pawn or taking blacks e6 pawn} Re8 {This move suprised me as I can skewer the rook as we will see} 45. Qb5+ Kd6 46. Qxe8 {And black resigned as all I need to do now is exchange the rook and the queen then black will be unable to prevent promotion.  thanks for reading please comment.}
