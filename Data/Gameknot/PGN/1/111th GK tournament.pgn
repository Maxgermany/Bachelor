1. d4 {I am annotating this game to help vectevs (1704) who is an over-the-board team mate!} Nf6 {So it start conventionally.} 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 {Transposing into a Queen's Gambit Declined.} 4. Nf3 Be7 5. e3 {It is more usual to develop the Bc1 to g5 - that is what I do as white - but this is perfectly playable.} O-O {Natural development.} 6. Be2 {White wants to castle king side too.} dxc4 {Black has wisely waited until white has moved the Bf1 before taking on c4.} 7. Bxc4 a6 {Preparing queen side expansion.} 8. O-O {Natural developing move...} b5 {So black expands.} 9. Be2 {and the bishop drops back.} Bb7 {Black puts the bishop on the long diagonal.} 10. Re1 {Perhaps with a view to playing e3-e4 sometime.} c5 {Black plays the natural freeing move.} 11. dxc5 {White takes.} Bxc5 {Black takes back.} 12. Qxd8 {Queens come off.} Rxd8 13. Rd1 {White contests the d file.} Rxd1+ {a pair of rooks come off.} 14. Bxd1 {White takes back.} Nc6 {Black develops the last minor piece. Black has a very small advantage here, due to better development, and a slight space advantage on the queen side.} 15. a3 {White prevents further advance of the b pawn.} Bd6 {I have the Gameknot computer analysis and neither side makes any mistake in this game according to it.  This looks wrong to me, I would have thought the natural move would be to seize the open file with the rook, or to centralise the king. I therefore set up this position on Fritz. Fritz does like this move.} 16. b4 {Black's spacial advantage on the queen side is no more.} Ne5 {Looking for more exchanges. An impression I am getting is that neither player is particularly ambitious in this game - both seem happy to trade pieces and head towards a draw.} 17. Nxe5 {So the knight comes off.} Bxe5 {Recaptured.} 18. Bb2 {almost symmetrical position now - at least on the a, b, g and h files...} Rc8 {Threatening to take on c3.} 19. Rc1 {so white protects.} Kf8 {King is centralised.} 20. f4 {This move looks weakening to me, and Fritz agree, preferring Be7 or Bb3.} Bxc3 {So black takes.} 21. Rxc3 {White takes back correctly.} Rd8 {Black wisely avoids the exchange for once.} 22. Rc1 {Fritz prefers Bb3 here.} Rd2 {Black takes control of the white's 2nd rank, attacking g2 and b2.} 23. Bxf6 {Black is wise to do this capture.} Rxg2+ {Black takes with check before recapturing.} 24. Kf1 {If Kh1?? Black can mate with R to g3, g4, g5 or g6!} gxf6 {Now black takes back. Although black is a pawn up, it is doubled, and hard to convert to a win.} 25. Rc8+ {This is an interesting move, offering the exchange of rooks in an unusual way.} Bxc8 {Which black accepts.} 26. Kxg2 {and white takes back.} Bb7+ {Black throws in a check.} 27. Kf2 {and white wisely avoids the bishop exchange. With bishops on it is harder for black to win.} Bc6 {Presumably to prevent a3-a4 and a pawn exchange on b5.} 28. Bc2 {white hits the pawn on h7.} f5 {Black blocks the attack.} 29. Ke2 {White centralises his king more.} Ke7 {Black's king follows him across.} 30. Kd2 {White moves the king over again, avoiding Kd3? Be4+} Kd7 {Not sure why black picked this square rather than d6.} 31. Kc3 {King is heading for the centre.} Kc7 {I'm not sure what black is trying to do.} 32. Kd4 {King comes up into he centre.} Kd6 {and the black king comes up to meet him.} 33. Bd3 {and the white king refuses to give way.} f6 {so black tries the only way possible.} 34. h4 {refusing to move the king again.} Bb7 {not sure of the point of this either.} 35. Bc2 {White of course is happy to mark time.} e5+ {Black finally comes up with the pawn advance.} 36. Kc3 {White extremely wises refuses to exchange and undouble black's pawns - which would clearly lose - and also refuses to retreat to d3, allowing Be4+ and the bishop exchange - which would also lose. White finds the one move to draw.} Be4 {Black offers the bishop exchange again.} 37. Bb3 {White wisely avoids.} Bc6 {Bishop drops back again.} 38. Kd2 {not sure of the point of this - the king seemed perfectly placed on c3} h6 {presumably h7-h8 is played to make sure it is safe from white's bishop.} 39. Bc2 {White attacks f5.} Ke6 {Black protects.} 40. Bb3+ {White checks.} Ke7 {King retreats. Maybe Bd5 was a better winning attempt, but it is hard for black to win.} 41. Kc3 {King returns.} Kd7 {Another king move.} 42. Kd2 {King drops back and a draw agreed.   My friend asked me "Be interesting to know if you think I played particularly well or if my opponent made major blunders." I think my considered reply would be - neither side made any major blunders. White played the opening slightly insipidly and dropped a pawn. It was always going to be hard to convert the pawn, but white played extremely well from that point on, and prevented black from converting.  Anyway, many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two, let me know how I am doing with my annotations, and grade this annotation on the star system. Until next time dear reader!}
