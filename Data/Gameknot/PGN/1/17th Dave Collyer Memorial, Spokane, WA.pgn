1. d4 {This is a game I played in Spokane, WA in the Dave Collyer Memorial chess tournament --2 hour time limit, sudden death-- So this is a over-the-board game.} Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 d5 4. Bd3 {Colle} c5 5. b3 {Zukertort.  } Nc6 6. O-O cxd4 7. exd4 Bd6 8. Bb2 O-O 9. Ne5 Qc7 10. f4 a5 11. a3 {  !  Meeting; 11) ...a4; 12) b4 11) a3. Also stops Nb4} Nd7 {Odd} 12. Nd2 {I thought connecting my rooks would be better than 12) Qh5} f6 13. Qh5 f5 14. Ndf3 Nf6 15. Qh3 Bxe5 16. Nxe5 {I am unsure how fxBe5 would do?} Nxe5 17. fxe5 Ne4 18. Bxe4 {I played this move fast.  I didn't want to analyze the pros & cons of letting the Knight hand there on e4.} dxe4 19. Rf2 {Planing to double my rooks} g5 {  !  This move got my attention.} 20. Qe3 {Blockading the e-Pawn and attacking the g-Pawn.} Qg7 {I seen this move coming!} 21. c4 {  !} Qg6 22. Re1 {Ready to trade Queen's if Black played Pawn-f4.} a4 {  !?} 23. bxa4 {I most certainly did not want to play b4.  If I did play 23) b4 I believe my opponent could have played Pawn-b6 or b5(!?), further fixing my Pawns and causing my C & D-Pawns to be inflexible.} Rxa4 24. Qb3 Ra8 25. Rfe2 {This was over-the-board and a tournament game so I played cautions.} b6 {  ! Boy! Did this move make my head spin!  I didn't have a single clue what my opponent had in-mind.  But if you do look at the position Black's light-squared Bishop is inactive} 26. Qxb6 Ba6 {  !} 27. Rc2 Bxc4 {Bravo! } 28. Rxc4 Rab8 29. Qc6 {  !  I placed the Queen here to Keep the e-Pawn in check.} Rxb2 30. d5 {This was my original plan when I played 21) c4 to follow up with d5.   I still play it, only with one pawn. } exd5 31. Qxd5+ Qf7 32. e6 Qe7 {?!} 33. Rc7 {  !  This Blocks any check from a7 or c5 from the Queen and forces the Queen to move.} Rd8 34. Rd7 Rc8 35. Rxe7 {Black resign}
