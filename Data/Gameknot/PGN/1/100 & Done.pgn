1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {The Italian game has always been a solid opening choice for white, but has grown out of favor lately with the Ruy Lopez. } Bc5 4. c3 {A common idea played to secure the d4 square and make a push to either d4 or b4 if given the opportunity. } Nf6 {Developing and attacking the e4 pawn, while also controlling d5.} 5. d3 {Played with the simple idea of protecting e4 and making way for the bishop and the knight. } O-O 6. O-O d6 7. b4 {White had plenty of other good alternatives such as Nbd2 or Bb3. With b4, white plans a pawn storm on the queen-side to try and create some weaknesses there. } Bb6 8. a4 {Continuing the plan and also threatening to trap the bishop. } a5 {8...a6 doesn't seem like a bad alternative either. The upside to this move is that is stops the a4 pawn in its tracks, but it does allow white to go on with 9. b5. } 9. b5 Ne7 10. Nbd2 Ng6 {This is the most effective square for the knight, looking to get to f4 when the time is right. It is also adding extra support to the e5 pawn and prepares a d5 push. } 11. Ba2 {This moves makes a lot of sense. This makes the c4 square available for both the c-pawn or the knight to press harder on the queen side. Additionally, with the bishop on a2 instead of b3 it allows the a-rook to have more control over the b-file after Rb1. } d5 {This move also makes a lot of sense. The pawn on d5 attacks e4 while also preventing the knight from coming to c4.} 12. Qc2 {Qc2 gives more protection to the d3-e4 pawn chain. White can now be able to safely take on d5 in order to open the e-file for the rook.} c6 {Played to try and create a weakness by exchanging on b5. } 13. Rb1 {Obviously, white does not want to allow black to have a passed pawn after cxb5, axb5. So white just slides the rook to activate it.  } Re8 14. Re1 h6 {A couple of simple development moves, followed by this prophylactic move of h6 just to make sure that nothing can get on g5.    } 15. c4 {Now the action starts. White is practically forcing black to relieve some tension in the center since the pawn push to c5 forcing the bishop into passiveness can't be allowed.  } dxe4 {This seems more reasonable than 15...dxc4, which could follow up with 16. Nxc4 Bc7, and it seems that whites position is very comfortable. } 16. Nxe4 Nxe4 {The knight exchange make sense as it loosens white's grip on c5. } 17. dxe4 {Note that white can't play 17. Rxe4?? because of Bf5. } Bc5 {So now black must do something about the threat of a pawn push to c5. My first thought would be been to play 17...c5, but that leaves the bishop in an awkward position on b6. This keeps the bishop active. } 18. Be3 Qe7 {Both sides are now just finishing development. } 19. Bxc5 {I wonder why this exchange was necessary, perhaps ensuring that the bishop can't pivot on b4. } Qxc5 20. Qc3 {Curious, I would have probably just played something like h3. However, this move looks to get the queen to e3 and get more control over the c5 square.  } Nf4 {Planning to hop the knight over to e6 to defend the queen after Qe3. } 21. Qe3 Ne6 22. Qc3 {Attacking the e5 pawn now. } f6 {Here I am very curious, 22...Nd4 just looks right here. It seems that after 23. Nxd4 exd4 24. Qd3 Qe5 with the idea of solidifying the d4 pawn with c5 appears uncomfortable for white. But of course f6 is logical, solidifying the e5 pawn.  } 23. Red1 {Logical, occupying the open d-file. } Kh7 {Simple prophylactic move getting the king off of the vulnerable a2-g8 diagonal.  } 24. bxc6 bxc6 {With the pawn exchange, white's rook becomes more powerful on the now open b-file. } 25. g3 {Preventing the knight from coming to f4. } Ba6 {At this point, it is becoming clear that white's bishop on a2 is just not that good as long as it is stuck looking at the c4 pawn. } 26. Kg2 Rab8 27. Ne1 {This move makes sense as the knight aims to go to d3. } Rxb1 28. Rxb1 Rd8 {But now that black has exchanged the b-rooks, it is clear that this plan doesn't work out since now if the knight goes to d3 black can play Qd4! and white has too many weaknesses.  } 29. Nf3 {So white just relocates the knight back to f3 in order to defend the pivotal d4 square. } Bc8 {This makes sense as the bishop has better prospects on this diagonal.} 30. Rb2 {Creeping up to b2 with the idea of swinging over the d2 and challenge the d-file. } Ng5 {Again, it seems that Nd4 is more natural here. But this practically forces white to exchange knights because of the threat of Bh3+. } 31. Nxg5+ hxg5 32. h3 Be6 {Now black is threatening some serious stuff here - Qd4 looks quite painful  for white. At this point, it is clear that white is at a positional disadvantage. } 33. Qf3 {Targeting the h5 square, but black can prevent this easily with Kh6/Kg6. } Kh6 34. Qe2 Kg6 35. Qf3 Rh8 {Now white must play g4, provoking more potential weaknesses in the white position. } 36. g4 Rd8 37. Qc3 Bf7 38. Rb7 Qd4 39. Qa3 c5 {Instead of grabbing the e4 pawn right away, black just continues to ensure that white can not possibly generate any counter play. That is what all of these next moves ensure as well. } 40. Qf3 Be6 41. Rb6 Bd7 42. Bb3 Be8 43. Bc2 Kh6 {Why should black even bother taking the pawn after all? Just remain patient and everything will be just fine.} 44. Qb3 Bf7 45. Rc6 Bg6 {Again, no need to take on c4 right awayor else white might still be able to generate a counter attack by striking at the a or c pawn.} 46. Ra6 Qd2 47. Ra7 Qb4 48. Kf1 Rd4 49. Rc7 Qxc4+ {Now that all possible attempts at a counter-attack by white have been quenched, it is time for black to convert the positional advantage into a material advantage. } 50. Qxc4 Rxc4 51. Bb3 {Even now we can see that whites bishop just doesn't have a good place to go. Blacks bishop is so much more active and white will soon have to give up the e-pawn as we'll.} Rb4 52. Bd1 c4 53. Ke1 Bxe4 54. f3 {White can't allow the bishop on to g2, so this is necessary. Although it does give room for the black rook to get in from b2 to h2 and attack the h3 pawn.} Bd3 55. Kd2 Rb2+ 56. Kc3 Rh2 57. Rc5 {Now white does have an opportunity to snag the a5 pawn, but white won't have much of a problem from stopping the passed a4 pawn.  } Rh1 58. Kd2 Kg6 59. Rxa5 Rxh3 60. Ra7 Rh2+ {Now it is clear that the room can just go to a2 and crush any idea white may have of getting the a-pawn promoted.} 61. Kc3 Ra2 62. a5 Ra1 63. Kd2 Ra3 64. a6 f5 {Played with he idea of creating a passed f-pawn.} 65. Ra8 f4 66. a7 e4 67. fxe4 Bxe4 {It seems that maybe white might have a slight chance due to the fact that black has doubled pawns. But black will not have much of a problem as long as it is played correctly. } 68. Rc8 Rxa7 69. Rxc4 {This is about as much as white could hope for. But unfortunately for white there are not enough resources to defend.} Bd5 70. Rc5 Rd7 71. Ke1 Kf6 72. Be2 {White must now just focus on keeping all of his pieces on the board. Any exchange (except for a rook exchange) will prove to be fetal for white.} Be4 73. Kf2 Rd2 74. Ke1 Rd6 75. Kf2 Bd3 {Black of course just want the bishops to be exchange which will make things much easier for black. After the bishops are exchanged all black has to do is get white in a position in which the white king is blocked off from stopping the passed f-pawn while also being in a situation where the white rook is restricted to prevent the black king from advancing any farther. } 76. Bf3 {So white must hold on to the bishop as long as possible to make things more complicated. } Ba6 77. Rf5+ Kg6 78. Rc5 Bd3 79. Bd5 Kh7 80. Kf3 Bc2 81. Rxc2 Rxd5 {But inevitably the bishops have come off, and black will execute the plan outlined earlier. } 82. Ke4 Ra5 83. Rb2 Kh6 84. Rb6+ g6 85. Rb8 {All white can try to do now is prevent the king from becoming active.} Kg7 86. Rb7+ Kf8 87. Rb3 Ra4+ 88. Kf3 Kg7 89. Rb7+ Kh6 90. Rb8 Rd4 91. Ra8 Kg7 92. Ra7+ Kf6 93. Ra6+ Kf7 94. Ra5 Rd3+ 95. Ke4 Re3+ {And with that this game is just about over since the king is now in a position where it can't touch the passed f-pawn.} 96. Kd4 Rg3 97. Rxg5 Re3 {After good maneuvering by black, this endgame has been converted. The white king now has no shot at stopping the f pawn because of the rook on the e-file and the white rook can't move off the 5 column  or the black king can advance and capture the g4 pawn. } 98. Rc5 Kf6 99. Rb5 Re1 100. Ra5 f3 {And after 100 moves white has finally resigned since the f pawn simply can't be stopped. Black took control over the board early - practically stopping white from coming up with any sufficient defense despite white's best efforts.}
