1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. Bd3 Nf6 7. O-O d5 8. Nd2 Be7 9. Re1 {9.Qe2, 9.b3 or 9.c4 are all commonly played.} O-O 10. c3 a5 11. e5 Nd7 12. Nf3 c5 13. Bf4 Ba6 {Black tries to exchange White’s key Bishop.} 14. Bc2 {But of course White prefers to keep it on the board.} Rb8 15. Qd2 Re8 {15…Rxb2? would be a blunder, because of the discovery 16.Bxh7+.} 16. h4 d4 {This is an inaccuracy and gives white a lot of play.  Black could’ve aimed for a draw with 16…Bxh4 17.Nxh4 Qxh4 18.Bg5 Qg4 (18…Qc4 19.Re3) 19.Bd1 Qf5 20.Bc2 Qg4 21.Bd. If white plays on, he is down a pawn and black is a little better. And Black’s Queen cannot escape via c4 either, because of 22.Be2. But given the huge rating difference it is understandable that Black is looking for more than a draw.} 17. cxd4 cxd4 18. Bg5 {Black’s idea was that if 18.Nxd4 Bb4 or 18.Qxd4 Bc5.} f6 {A very risky move. 18…Bxg5 19.Nxg5 Nf8 lead to a safer position for black.} 19. exf6 gxf6 20. Bh6 {Better was 20.Rxe6 Bc4 (20…fxg5 21.Rxa6 Nc5 22.Rxa5 d3 23.Ba4 White is up 2 pawns with a solid advantage.) 21.Re4 fxg5 22.Rxd4 Bb4 (22…Bb5 23.a4 Bc6 24.Qd3; 22…Be6 23.Re1 Bc5 24.Rxe6) 23.Bxh7+! Kh8 (23…Kxh7? 24.Rxd7+) 24.Qc2 Be6 25.hxg5 with a winning position.} e5 {Black has a nice center, but due to the lack of a g-pawn Black’s King is in danger.} 21. Re4 {A natural and strong attacking move.} Kh8 {Black’s best choice was 21…Bf8 22.Bb3+ Kh8 23.Rg4 Rxb3 24.axb3 f5 25.Rg3 f4 26.Bxf4 exf4 27.Qxf4 Bg7 28.Ng5 Qf6 29.Nf7+ Kg8 30.Qxf6 Nxf6 31.Nd6 and White is better, but Black has some hope to survive.} 22. Nxd4 {Another good option was 22.Bg7+ Kxg7 23.Rg4+ Kf7 24.Qh6 with a killer attack.} exd4 {Relatively best was 22…Bb4 23.Bg7+ Kxg7 24.Rg4+ Kh8 25.Qh6 Re7 26.Nc6 Qf8 27.Qxf8+ Rxf8 28.Rxb4 axb4 29.Nxe7 but white has a winning endgame advantage.} 23. Rxd4 Rb7 24. Bg7+ {! Bang! White finds a second nice sacrifice, which wins the game.} Kxg7 25. Rg4+ Kf8 {If 25…Kh8 26.Qh6.} 26. Qd5 {Black cannot stop the mate. If he goes 26…Bc5, then 27.Rg8+ Ke7 28.Rg7+ Kf8 29.Qf7 checkmate.}
