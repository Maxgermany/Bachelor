1. e4 {Tied in Knots....  A game where I felt comfortable, got complacent and was done like a kipper.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. Qe2+ Be6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bg5 Be7 7. f4 O-O 8. Nf3 Bb4 {All fairly standard, no fireworks so far.} 9. Qd3 Nc6 10. Ne5 Re8 11. O-O-O {Bad choice as it turns out.} Be7 12. Nxc6 bxc6 13. h3 Rb8 14. g4 Rb6 {More than a little bemused by that move.} 15. Na4 Rb7 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 17. Nc5 Rb6 18. Nxe6 Rxe6 {At this point I'm quite happy, level on material and with (imho) slightly better development.} 19. f5 Re4 20. c3 Qb8 21. b3 {Yes yes yes, you can't get me, I've got a pawn wall.} Rxb3 {Oh.} 22. axb3 Qxb3 {Well that wasn't so bad. Need to get the king back over to safety but thats ok. } 23. Qc2 Bg5+ {And thats the move which will haunt me. Unable to move the king my choices go summat like this....  r-d2..r-e1, q-d1..rxq# q-d2..bxq or q-a3 or...well.... you get the idea.  I cried and then wimped out.}
