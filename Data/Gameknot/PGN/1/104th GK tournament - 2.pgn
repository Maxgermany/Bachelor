1. a4 e5 {I like opening the bishop diagonal crustacean pawns.  I don't know why players want their rooks on a row so close to home.} 2. c4 Bb4 3. e4 Bc5 4. d3 Qf6 {Does anyone ever fall for the four move anymore?} 5. Be3 {No.  Nf3 also works, without doubling pawns.} d6 6. h4 Na6 7. h5 Nb4 8. Nc3 c6 9. g3 Rb8 {What is that?  A long range plan?} 10. f4 {Oops, that pawn was all that stood between that bishop and the pearly gates of heaven.} Bxe3 11. f5 Qg5 12. g4 g6 13. Nf3 {Wrong side.  Nh3 leaves Pg4 protected by the queen.} Qxg4 14. fxg6 {Uh, that is two pawns for one.  Bad trade.  } hxg6 15. Qe2 Nc2+ {Nice fork.  Knight for knight.} 16. Qxc2 Qxf3 17. Qg2 Bf2+ {?  Queen bishop for queen?  Lousy trade.} 18. Kd2 {What?  White is down four.  Down only one after this deal.  Well, two with PxPh5.  } Qf4+ 19. Kc2 gxh5 20. Ne2 Qe3 21. Rd1 {Rh2 and black cannot save that bishop.} Nf6 22. Qg7 {...even better.  Though Rh6 saves the knight.} Qh6 {...that too.} 23. Qg2 Ng4 24. Ng3 {Oh no.  Ne3 forks the king, queen, AND rook.  Kiss the queen good bye.} Ne3+ 25. Kc1 Nxg2+ {Discovered check saves the knight.  Free and easy queen.  Round heeled biddy, trampled by a horse.} 26. Kb1 Ne3 27. Rd2 Bxg3 28. Re2 b5 {Up 17, every trade is gravy now.} 29. Bh3 Qf4 30. b3 Qf3 {Queen forks rooks.  They cannot protect each other because of the bishop.} 31. Ree1 Bxe1 32. Rxe1 Bxh3 33. axb5 cxb5 34. Rc1 bxc4 35. dxc4 Rxb3+ 36. Ka2 Rb6 37. Ka3 Nxc4+ 38. Ka2 Qb3+ 39. Ka1 Qb2# {}
