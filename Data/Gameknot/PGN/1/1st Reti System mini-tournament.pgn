1. Nf3 {This is the Queen's Indian Defense d5-pawn sac line.  A nice positional crush up to the sacrificial finish.  Feel free to leave comments, especially if you're going to give it 1 star!!!} Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Bg2 e6 5. O-O Be7 6. d4 {6. Nc3 0-0; 7. Re1! is more topical and now 7...Ne4, 7...c5, or 7...d5 are possible.} c5 {It's difficult to believe that such a seemingly natural move is a mistake, however, White's next move not only cramps the Black position, but gives White dangerous initiative.} 7. d5 {This temporary pawn sacrifice can also occur when Black plays 6...0-0; 7. d5 ed; 8. Nh4 c6!?, with roughly equal chances.  With the c-pawn on c5 the White pawn center will permanently cramp the Black position.} exd5 8. Nh4 {A typical theme in the QID, white exploits the pin on the h1-a8 diagonal to win back the pawn.  The h4-knight also prepares to sink in on f5 with threats against the Black king.} d6 {Another idea is 8...Na6 followed by ...Nc7.} 9. cxd5 Nbd7 {Black chooses the more central deployment of the knight, retaining the possibility of dropping in on e5.} 10. Nc3 {Preventing any "comeback" tactics on the d5-pawn due to the queen and bishop battery on the h4-d8 diagonal.} O-O 11. Nf5 {I was in no rush to play e4 and want to meet ...g6 with Nh6 , keeping the Black pieces awkwardly placed.} Ne5 12. Bg5 {This move turns out to be not so good, as Black gets some tempi by kicking it around.} h6 13. Bf4 {Then again, h6 does become the scene of a later sacrifice!} Ng6 14. Bd2 {Operating on the premise that any exchanges favor the cramped side, I preserve the bishop for later deployment.  It also seems that the Black knight is better on e5 than on g6, but I could be wrong.} Re8 15. Qc2 {Preparing the centralize the rooks and push the e- and f-pawns.} Bf8 {It seems that Black has made the most of his reorganization.  White still has the advantage due to the static space advantage and better placed pieces.} 16. Rfe1 {I was entertaining the idea of Ra-e1 also.} Qd7 {Black continues to unravel, all would be well, if Black could play ...d5.} 17. Rac1 {Not so sure about this move, as I was intending Rad1, but at the last minute I had some idea about slowing down Black's queenside play as I was sure ...b5 and ...c4 was sure to come.} b5 {Black's only feasible plan of expansion.} 18. e4 {Now it's a race!} b4 19. Nd1 {The knight wants to go to c4 via e3.} a5 20. Nde3 a4 21. Nc4 Qd8 {...Qc7 might be preferable, still avoiding the fork on b6, and keeping the rooks connected and maybe more importantly, keeping e5 under control as this is going to be the only pawn break White has!  } 22. f4 {Attack!!!} Ra6 {Black has made some progress on the queenside, but his queenside pieces are imprisoned by the pawn structure and his kingside pieces are just waiting for the attack.  Such a passive defense is not advisable.} 23. a3 {Now that the rook wont be able to come to the b-file quickly due to my control over b6, I dont mind opening the b-file, as my heavy pieces will be able to occupy it much quicker.} b3 {Probably a correct decision, however, Black's queenside play is at an end.} 24. Qd3 {Keeping an eye on the d-pawn for the eventual e5-break.} Nd7 25. Bc3 {This position should tell the strategic story.  Comparative coordination of the pieces is the key to the position.} Nb8 {The position is closed, but Black does not have time for such luxuries.  25...Qc7 prevents the break for a little while longer.} 26. e5 dxe5 27. fxe5 {The central pawn duo is deadly!!!} Ra7 28. e6 {This position is resignable, but Black's next move allows a nice combination.} Ne7 29. Nxh6+ {When you have an overwhelming positional advantage, start looking for the killshot tactic.  Here it is.  Black is either mated right away or loses a ton of material.} gxh6 {If Black plays 29...Kh8; 30. Nxf7  Kg8; 31. Be4! decides matters.} 30. exf7+ Kxf7 31. Qh7+ Bg7 32. Qxg7# {Thanks to my opponent for a fun game.}
