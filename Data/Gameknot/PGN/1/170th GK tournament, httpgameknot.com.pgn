1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. d4 {I’ve been using this more often in the last year. } Bd7 5. c3 {This is the slow, preparatory move that I previously used before 4.d4. } a6 {Not bad but Bc4 is still an option.  …Nf6 would force Nd2 or maybe Bg5. } 6. Ba4 {Post-analysis…. Computer much prefers Bc4 but I’m more familiar with the text move. } Nf6 7. Bc2 {7.O-O Nxe4 8.Re1 is playable but again, not much experience with it. } g6 8. Bg5 {In the recent Carlsen-Caruana match there were comments to the effect that this type of move is not best.  Not 100% sure why.  Be3 best??  Anyway, I have intentions to move the DSB around to g3. } Bg7 9. O-O {9.d5 would interfere with his DSB but I wasn’t in the mood for such a closed game after having just played a few. } Qc8 {Didn’t see that coming.  …h6, …O-O, …Bg4 in my opinion. } 10. Qc1 {Post-analysis computer doesn’t like it.  Takes away from the central control.  Now I’m 5 vs his 6. } Bg4 11. Nbd2 {Computer says this is best but I never even considered it’s second suggestion of 11.Qe3 which I probably would have preferred. } h6 12. Bh4 {Computer considers this a mistake.  12.Be3 best. } Bxf3 {Completes his plan but frees my position to my advantage.  I’m 5 vs 6 in the centre. } 13. Nxf3 g5 {He has no intention of opening the centre. } 14. Bg3 Nh5 15. Qd1 {My Q is no use on c1 anymore.  Wish I could tackle the hole on f5. } Nxg3 16. hxg3 {Wow the computer prefers fxg3.  Gotta think about that for a while.  The only benefit I see is mobility for the R.  Over the course of the game it would not have mattered. } g4 17. Nh4 {17.Nh4 is a plan to get to f5, block his Q from g4 and get my Q in his k-side.  Of course it’s a result of his text move which technically is a mistake. +1.09 (better is 16...exd4 or 16...d5)  } h5 {Could still try …exd4 maybe. } 18. Nf5 Bf6 {Computer suggests awkward moves like …Rh7 or …Kf8. } 19. Bb3 {I don’t have any notes on this but computer doesn’t list it as much of an option.  Seems obvious enough aiming at f7. } exd4 20. cxd4 Qd7 21. f3 {21.f3 to open up the k-side but might fail to ...Bxd4+ we'll see if he takes the trap.  Nope so I focus on the weak c6 square with Rc1.  He needs to improve on his K-side attack.  At move 21 the computer had a complicated plan to fake a pin on the Q & K to bring the pawn out.  Too deep for me, didn’t see it.  Plus the computer must be thinking it’s a mistake to open the h-file for my opponent.  - / + } O-O-O 22. fxg4 hxg4 23. Rc1 {Not 23.Qxg4 Bxd4+!  } Kb8 24. Ba4 b5 25. Bb3 Rh7 26. Qd2 {26.Qd2 I'm stuck. Might try d5.  His double R on the h-file would look gnarly.  Dunno why he plays his next move. } Re8 27. Qc3 {27.Qc3 back to the c6 square.  And holy cow the computer analyses 27…Qxf5 as the best follow-up move. } Na7 28. a4 {Attack the K!! } Rxe4 29. Rf4 {Bd5 was needed. } Rxf4 30. gxf4 c6 31. Qd3 Kb7 32. Nxd6+ {32.Nxd6+ screw it. Discovered attack on the R looks pretty so I jumped at it before analyzing.  With 31…Kb7 he must have wanted to relieve his N but missed that it put him into a fork. } Qxd6 33. Qxh7 Bxd4+ {Darn check. } 34. Kh1 Qxf4 35. Qxf7+ {Bye bye Q’s. } Qxf7 36. Bxf7 Bxb2 37. Rc2 {Keep the pressure. } Bd4 38. axb5 axb5 39. Kh2 {Keep my K from being pinned down. } Be5+ 40. Kg1 g3 41. Kf1 Kb6 42. Ke2 c5 43. Kf3 Nc6 44. Ke4 Bc7 45. Rc3 {45.Rc3 pretty stale  } Ne5 46. Be6 c4 {46...c4 takes that square from his N so 47.Rxg3 and I'm boss! } 47. Rxg3 Nd3 48. Rg6 {48.Rg6 (...Nc5 49.Kd4/Kd5 +/-) Nf4 49.Rh6 Nxe6 50.Rh6 and if Nxg2 then 51.Bh3+ attacking the N. } Kc5 49. g4 {49.g4 Nf4 (fork) } b4 50. Rg5+ {50.Rg5+  } Kc6 51. Bxc4 Nf2+ 52. Kf3 {52.Kf3 (not Kf5 which is OK to keep opposition on his K) maintains the scope of my R (53.Rb5!) and pressures his N. } Nd1 53. Rh5 Nb2 54. Bf7 Nd3 {54...Nd3 at this point acenlv took first place with a win over bcjuk but we could all tie at 4 points if I win this. } 55. Ke4 Nf2+ 56. Kf5 {}
