1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O {So far the game has been a tame Italin opening. But here is white first mistake, there is no need to castle this early. In fact it is too soon, because it gives black a target to play against. The king should have kept his options open a little longer.} Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. Bg5 {This, in combination with an early 0-0 could spel trouble.} h6 7. Bh4 {But here is the real mistake, allowing black to opn up against white king. The game may still be a long one, but the root of white's future trouble is this move.} g5 8. Bg3 Be6 9. Nbd2 Qd7 10. c3 {Now black has to deal with a possible d4 breakthrough. Also white may aim to gain space with b4 + a4} Bb6 {To protect against an immediate d4, now black can counter Bxc4 and Nxe4. The open e line couls be dangerous though.} 11. b4 a6 12. Qb3 O-O-O {Looks like it is going to be a race who get to the others kings first. Thanks to white 6th and 7th move black has a nice lead with h6and g5. Black is certainly better here.} 13. a4 a5 {The correct response., blocking whites advance immediately.} 14. Qb2 {Preparing for d4} Nh5 {Defending e5, and createing a target to strike against with my pawns on g3.} 15. Bb5 {Also a good move.} Nxg3 16. hxg3 {Now the h4 pawn has a target to march on. White cannot stop the black pawn the way black did with a5.} h5 {The pawn g5 is of no imporatnce here.} 17. Nc4 {A good move, putting me under pressure. The theart is Bxc6 and Bxa5, so black has to act, and trade his favourite bishop.} Bxc4 18. dxc4 {But this is not good. } h4 {Marching on! Less good was g4, becasue after Nh4 the pawns advance has been stoped forgood.} 19. Bxc6 {And this is a fatal mistake. He should have played g4! to try and stop those pawns.} Qxc6 {I had wanted tyo play bxc6 to keep my Queen ready to jump to g4. Unfortunately is runs into a counter attack: 19...,bxc6; 20.bxa5, Bxa5; 21.Rab1,Bb6; 22.a5;  So I had a seconde look at Qxc6 and realised the position is strategically won. White has horrible weaknesses on e4 and c4. } 20. Nxg5 {Threatening Nxf7, but it is a harmless try. Black has bigger game in sight.} hxg3 {Of course.} 21. Nxf7 Qxe4 {Now Nxd8 is met with Qh4 and wins. } 22. Ng5 {A last ditch attempt to save himself. Better was 22.Nxh8, Qh4!; 23.Rd1,gxf2+; 24.Kf1,Qh1+; 25.Ke2,Qxg2; 26.Rf1, e4!; 27.Qb1, Qf3+; 28.Kd2, e3+; 29.Kc2, e2 and black wins easily.} Qh4 23. Nh3 Rdg8 {The finaly piece of is in play. Notice how all black pieces are aimed at white's King. There is no hope for white.} 24. Kh1 gxf2 {Threatening Qxh3} 25. Kh2 {A last attempt to save himself. But the king has not helper left, and he canot hold the forst all by himself.} Rxg2+ {White surrendered. Two moves were left unplayed: 26.Kxg2, Qxh3 checkmate.}
