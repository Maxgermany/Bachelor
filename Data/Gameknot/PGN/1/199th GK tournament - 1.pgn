1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 h6 {Various moves have been tried here - Nf6, a6, c6, e6, c5 - but this is most unusual. } 4. e3 Be6 {If Black wants to try to hold on to the pawn, he should have played 3...c6 or 3...a6.} 5. Nc3 {It's probably best to regain the pawn immediately with Na3.} Nf6 6. e4 {The pawn could have gone here on move 4. The best way to regain the pawn was 6.Ne5.} Nh7 {? 6...c6 would have made it difficult for White to regain the pawn.} 7. d5 Bg4 8. Bxc4 a6 9. h3 Bh5 10. Qa4+ {The immediate g4 was better.} Qd7 11. Qb4 {b3 was a better square for the queen.} Qc8 {11...b5 looks better, but White can still play 12.g4.} 12. g4 Bg6 13. Ne5 e6 14. Qa4+ Kd8 {With the Black king stranded in the centre, the game is effectively over.} 15. dxe6 Nf6 16. exf7 {Qd1+ was the most accurate continuation.} Bh7 17. g5 hxg5 18. Bxg5 Bd6 19. Ng4 {0-0-0, bringing another piece into the game was even stronger.} Qd7 20. Nxf6 Qxa4 21. Nxh7+ Kc8 22. Nxa4 Rxh7 23. O-O-O Rh8 24. Be6+ Nd7 25. e5 {25.Nb6+ also wins a piece.} Bxe5 26. Rxd7 Bf6 27. Bxf6 gxf6 28. Rhd1 {Rg1 was even stronger.} b6 {There is a forced mate here: 29.Rd8+ Kb7 30.Bd5+ Ka7 31.Bxa8 Rxa8 32. Rxd8 b5 33.f8Q a5 34.Qc5+ Ka6 Qc6+ Ka7 36.Qb7#} 29. Re7+ Kb7 30. Bd5+ {}
