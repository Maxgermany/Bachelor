[Opening "King's Indian (E97), orthodox, Aronin-Taimanov, bayonet attack"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 {A typical King's Indian defense position. Black basically gives ground to white in the hopes of making him overextended and thus vulnerable to pawn and pieces counterattacks.} d6 {discouraging e5 for the time being. While e5 can be played, after the pawn exchanges (and a probable queen trade), white's pawn center liquidates.} 5. Nf3 {both white knights develop to their natural squares.} O-O 6. Be2 {white is slightly ahead in development, so next move for black is critical} e5 {options for white are to trade (least desirable), close the center or continue developing. White chooses the latter.} 7. O-O Nc6 {black catches on in development.} 8. d5 {white gains a tempo, but closes the position.} Ne7 9. b4 {A variation of the KID called the bayonet attack. White expands to the queenside, while black should counterattack to the kingside.} Nh5 {preparing f5} 10. Re1 f5 {as planned} 11. Ng5 {trying to exploit the weakness caused by f5. It is not as bad as it looks, because trading the LSB for the knight in a closed position is a decent trade off.} Nf6 12. f3 {reinforcing d4.} Kh8 {more like a useful waiting move than anything else. I want to see what white intends to do.} 13. Qc2 {overprotecting the d4 pawn. However, that move is inaccurate and the reason will be revealed soon.} h6 {putting the question mark on the knight.} 14. Ne6 {The expected reply. Now the bishop knight trade is forced.} Bxe6 15. dxe6 fxe4 16. fxe4 {after all these trades, white retains the bishop pair at the cost of a ruined pawn structure. One pawn is passed, but it is very difficult to defend.} Nc6 17. Nd5 {putting the knight on a very good square. Black cannot recapture since that would undouble white's pawns making the e6 pawn very strong. However, black has a tactical trick thanks to the poor queen placement.} Nd4 {hitting both the queen and the e6 pawn. 18. e7 does not work since after this variation: 18. e7 Nxc3 19. exd8=Q Rexd8 white will lose the exchange no matter what.} 18. Qd3 Nxe6 {getting rid of the annoying e6 pawn.} 19. Qh3 {attacking both the e6 knight and the h6 pawn.} Nf4 20. Nxf4 exf4 21. Bxf4 Kh7 {practically forced.} 22. Bd3 {trying to align the lsb to the black king. That is however a blunder and falls to another tactical shot.} Nh5 {hitting the dsb and the a1 rook at the same time!} 23. Be3 Bxa1 24. Rxa1 {now black is up the exchanage and the plan is to bring the game to a favourable endgame.} Nf4 25. Bxf4 {forced.} Rxf4 26. g3 Rf6 {making queen infiltration impossible.} 27. Rf1 {white offers one more trade. I don't mind.} Rxf1+ 28. Qxf1 Qe7 {Again, making sure no queen counterplay puts white back into the game.} 29. h4 {trying to attack the pawns in front of the king.} Rf8 {putting the rook on the only open file with a tempo.} 30. Qe2 Qe5 {centralising the queen and hitting the g pawn.} 31. Kg2 Qh5 {offering a queen trade. It is slightly inaccurate though, since the task of defeating black is now slightly more complex.} 32. Qxh5 gxh5 33. e5+ Kg7 34. exd6 cxd6 {and black has an isolated pawn and well as two doubled pawns on the h file.} 35. a4 b6 {putting as many pawns on the dark squares as possible.} 36. Be2 Rf5 {protecting the h pawn. The rook prevents the king from coming to the queenside. Because of that, the plan is to somehow move my king to the queenside and advance from there.} 37. Bd3 Re5 {now the rook cannot be attacked from the bishop anymore.} 38. Kf2 Kf6 {king goes towards the centre where it's more active.} 39. Bc2 a5 {the plan is to undermine the queenside white pawns.} 40. bxa5 bxa5 41. Bd3 {bishop and king make rook infiltration impossible. Thus, victory can only come from the king.} Ke7 {king relocates to the queenside as mentioned.} 42. Bg6 Kd7 {White resigns. He realises my plan and he  cannot prevent it (basically the plan is to bring the king to the b4 square where one of the pawns will fall, creating a passed pawn. The white king is totally out of the game.)}
