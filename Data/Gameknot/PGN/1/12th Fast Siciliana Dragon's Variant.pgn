1. e4 {This game was played in the 12th Siciliana Dragons Variant mini tournament  between macua (1451) and rromeroh (1631). Play starts after black move six. } g6 2. Nf3 Bg7 3. d4 c5 4. Nc3 d6 5. Be3 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nf6 {We now reach the initial starting position for play and the Opening has transposed into the Sicilian Dragon, arguably one of the most exciting chess openings. White now has two main options.  1) f3 (The Yugoslav) - the most common response. White usually follows with Qd2, O-O-O and a full on kingside onslaught (h4,g4 etc)  2) Be2 (The Classical) - a quieter move usually followed by O-O and the possibility of f4.   } 7. Qd2 {White forms a queen and bishop battery, preparing to eliminate Blacks fianchettoed bishop by way of h6. However, what Qd2 fails to achieve that f3 or Be2 achieve is that is prevents a certain black piece from going to g4.} Ng4 {Ng4! - Black spots Whites mistake and immediately places his knight on g4. White's plan is to eliminate the fianchetoed bishop by way of h6 but the pesky knight controls h6 and attacks Whites bishop. In order to keep the bishop on the board without losing material, he must move to g5.             8) Bf4, e5) } 8. Bg5 {As expected. } h6 {h6! - Black now attacks White's bishop with a pawn and now must choose whether to move the bishop off the c1-h8 diagonal or swap it off with Blacks knight. This stops White's plan to get rid of Black's fianchettoed bishop.  } 9. Bh4 {White chooses to move the bishop off the diagonal and it now looks weak and out of place compared to Black's nicely placed fianchettoed bishop which dominates the a1-h8 diagonal. Black must still be cautious though as whites dark squared bishop could still cause problems for black by putting pressure on the e7 square.  } Nc6 {Black now develops his knight while putting more pressure on d4. Black now has a huge initiative.} 10. Bb5 {White pins Blacks knight but it is a feeble attempt at counter-play as the threat is only short-term and easily defendable, (Bd7).  Better is Nb3 which brings the knight away from the bishops firing line and defends the queen-side, preparing for a king-side counter-attack. } Qb6 {Qb6? – This move may seem ideal as Black defends his knight while putting even more pressure on d4. The queen also covers b2 and when the bishop moves, black will be putting direct pressure on that square which will cause trouble for white no matter what side White will castle. The queen and the bishop are not in a battery, they are working together very effectively.   So why is this a bad move?  The answer is 11. Nd5! This forces the Queen away from the lovely b6 square. The queen now cannot protect both the knight and c7. Black cannot escape the position without losing at least a pawn.  Probably best is 11)…. Qxd4, Qxd4, Bxd4, Nc7 , Kd8, Nxa8, Bxb2, Rb1, Bc3 .  Black is a pawn down but the position is unclear. } 11. O-O-O {White castles queen-side to protect b2 and improve the safety of his king. He can now start his attack. Much better is Nd5!} O-O {Black also castles and will also start begin an attack. This move is actually better than it seems as it forces the knight and bishop exchange which will leave white more open without the bishop pair. In the dragon, a bishop on c4 or b3 is often an advantage as it pins f7 to Black's King on g8 which helps to open the h file.  } 12. Bxc6 {Forced. (Nb3, Bxc3, Qxc3, Qxb5) or (f3, Bxd4, fxg4, Be3)} bxc6 {Taking with the b pawn opens up the b file and stops Whites knight from moving to d5. White’s king now looks unsafe and even after Nb3, white can eventually put his a-pawn into use. } 13. f3 {White shuns the knight away from the g4 square and hopes that the influence of black’s fianchettoed bishop will be lowered if its path will be blocked by his own knight. However, it just encourages black to centralise the knight and aim for the c4 square. f4 could be considered to prevent black’s knight from moving to e5 and attempting some king-side counter play.    Lines are interesting after Bxe7. White picks up a couple of pawns but Black has a massive initiative and can put a lot of pressure on the queen-side and relocate his knight to e5. Both players must be cautious as the position is rich in tactics and strategies. I strongly suggest that you play out this particularly interesting line to discover these tactics and strategies.  } Ne5 {Black relocates his knight to the excellent central e5 square and aims for the even better c4.} 14. Bxe7 {Played one move too late} Nc4 {Nc4! - Threatening both Whites queen and checkmate. Macua believes that he must now surrender his queen to avoid checkmate and resigns.  However, playable for white is 15) Na4, Qa6, Qc3, Qxa4, 17) Qb3, Qxb3, axb3 where Black will emerge from the position only a pawn up. Black should win with the bishop pair for white’s knight but it will definitely be a harder victory.  OR  17) Bxf8, Bxf8, b3, Qa3 , Kb1, Ba6 where material is level but black has a huge initiative.  So there you have it! Not a flawless game but one which shows that although it is not used a lot by GMs today, the Dragon is rich in both tactics and strategy and therefore, arguably the most exciting opening in chess history! }
