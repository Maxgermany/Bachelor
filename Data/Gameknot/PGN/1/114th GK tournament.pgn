[Opening "QGD (D06), symmetrical (Austrian) defence"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 {I'm playing the Queen's Gambit, more or less my favorite when playing white.} c5 {He answers with the Symmetrical/Austrian Defense, an uncommon variation of the QG Declined, according to my research and I myself encountered it the first time since playing the QG opening.} 3. Nf3 {I continue with Nf3 to strengthen d4 and e5. In addition, I wanted to begin with the development of my minor pieces, which is why I was hesitant of cxd5.} Nf6 {So far, he mirrored everyone of my moves.} 4. Nc3 {Further development...} cxd4 5. Nxd4 {An exchange of pawns, leaving me with a centred knight.} dxc4 {In my opinion not the best move. e5 would've forced the retreat of the knight as well as opening the path for his bishop... Instead he allows me to take over control of the centre with e5 + opening the path for my white bishop to attack his c-pawn.} 6. e4 e5 {Now comes said move, forcing me to step back and propose the queen exchange.} 7. Nf3 Bd6 {Good move imo, declining the exchange as well developing the black bishop and preparing 0-0.} 8. Bxc4 {I reclaim the lost pawn and prepare for 0-0 as well.} O-O 9. Bg5 {Development as well as pinning the knight and thus weakening his claim to the centre.} h6 {Suboptimal as Bh4 upholds the pin. Better probalby would've been Nc6 or Bg4 for the pin as well.} 10. Bh4 Nc6 11. O-O Bc5 {He brings his bishop in line with my king and offers the exchange.} 12. Nd5 {I decline, since Qxd8 would've activated his rook and would not have brought any advantage to me. In addition, I put additional pressure on the knight.} g5 {Heavy mistake imo. He may unpin his knight, but heavily weakens his King's defence.} 13. Bxg5 {I decide to sacrifce the bishop in order to begin with a massive attack on his King.} hxg5 14. Nxg5 Nxd5 {A further, massive weakening of his king's positions.} 15. Qh5 {Threatening mate.} Nf6 {Defending as well as attacking my queen.} 16. Bxf7+ {The attack is now fully under way and he is forced exchange his rook for my bishop if he wants to repel mate.} Kg7 {He resists and mate is inevatiable. } 17. Qg6+ Kh8 {Forced move.} 18. Qh6+ Nh7 {And again.} 19. Qxh7# {And Qxh7#! I think this demonstrates nicely the importance of keeping the pawns in line when having a castled king since otherwise the pressure can rise to the point where material has to be sacrificed in order to remain in the game.}
