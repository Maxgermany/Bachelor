1. e4 {This game features the Evans Gambit of the Giuoco Piano.  I have to say, that defending against these attacks from White is not really my style of play.  I prefer more imbalanced positions like the Sicilian.  However, this game does have a very instructive motif, don't go pawn grabbing if your position is going to suffer.  In fact here, my strong opponent grabs the c-pawn and soon sees his position under such pressure, that all of his pieces are confined to the first rank!} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {The key move of the Evans.  White sacrifices a pawn for center control and a kingside initiative with a quick attack on the Black king.  As is typical of these gambits, if Black can defend accurately, he stands better in the ensuing endgame, with plenty of chances for a win.} Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 {...Bc5 sees the Black bishop lose another tempo with 6. d4.  The Bishop is exposed on a5, as we shall see in a few moves, but the move is the strongest.} 6. d4 exd4 7. O-O Nge7 {...Nf6 would be horrible on account of the immediate e5!  Here the Knight can swing to g6 if necessary.} 8. Ng5 {A thematic attack.  White will capture on f7 regaining his pawn and unseating the king.  The queen fork of the bishop and king from h5 will recover the piece. 8. Qb3 is also possible, since the bishop on a5 stops the queens-knight from forking the queen and bishop.} Ne5 {The best move.  8...0-0? loses a pawn and gives White a killer attack after 9. Qh5! h6 10. Bxf7  Kh8.  Note that the knight on e7 guards against Greco's Mate, but White has several strong attacking continuations which leave Black busted.} 9. Nxf7 {Also possible is 9. Bb3 maintaining the pressure.} Nxf7 10. Bxf7+ Kxf7 11. Qh5+ {Recovering the pawn and the piece.} g6 12. Qxa5 d5 {Stronger than 12...dc, which would just help White develop.  This counter-attack in the center is the best contintuation to fight for the initiative, as White's queen is the only developed piece!} 13. exd5 b6 {Force the queen to move and prepare to occupy the h1-a8 diagonal.} 14. Qa4 Qxd5 15. cxd4 {If 15. Qxd4 Bb7 16. Qxd5 Bxd5, Black is better due to his more active pieces, better pawn structure and 3-to-1 majority on the queenside.} Bb7 16. f3 b5 {Getting the majority rolling with tempo.} 17. Qb3 Nf5 {Moving the knight to a more active square where it targets the weak d4-pawn.} 18. Qxd5+ Bxd5 19. Rd1 {Perhaps 19. Bb2 was a better way to defend the pawn.} b4 {Continuing to advance the majority while depriving the White knight of its most natural square.} 20. Bf4 Rhe8 {The c7-pawn is off limits due to the opening of the c-file for Black which White will not be able to contest due to his backwards development.} 21. Bxc7 {Greed never pays!!!  Now its time to punish!} Rac8 22. Bf4 {Black is down a pawn, but Black's position is almost active to the fullest extent.  Even the King is better placed than it's counter part.  There is only one way for me to improve this position.} Rc2 {Occupation of the 7th rank.} 23. Kh1 {Preparing to play Rg1 in case of ...Nh4.  Not a very fun position to be in for White.} Ne3 {Forcing the exchange of White's only active piece, as 24. Rg1 Nxg2! wins for Black.} 24. Bxe3 Rxe3 25. Nd2 Re2 26. Nf1 {Forced as the blind pigs were set to gobble up the kingside pawns.} Bxa2 {Regaining the pawn and clearing the way for my queenside passers to advance while White is helpless.} 27. d5 b3 28. g4 g5 {Preventing any counterplay.  White is so tied up, there's no hurry.  This is a good psychological tool also.  The longer an opponent sits in a cramped position the more likely they are to try extremely risky maneuvers to break out and the higher the likelyhood of a mistake.} 29. Kg1 a5 30. d6 Ke8 {Stopping the pawn.} 31. Rde1 Kd7 32. Red1 a4 33. Kh1 a3 {Here White resigns as there is no way to stop the pawns without losing material.  Thanks to my opponent.}
