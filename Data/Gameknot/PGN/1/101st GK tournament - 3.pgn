1. e4 {Revenge Mark 2  Another one who gave me a good smack in our first game, so very satisfying to get some small measure of revenge.} Nc6 2. d4 e5 3. d5 Nce7 4. Nf3 f6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 d6 7. Bc4 b5 8. Bb3 g5 9. h3 g4 10. hxg4 Bxg4 {Quite pleased so far. Developmentally felt I was much the better though that bishop worries me a little.} 11. Rh4 h5 12. Qd2 Ng6 13. Rh1 Bxf3 14. gxf3 c5 15. dxc6 e.p. {I do like en passant. Unless there is another more potent move I'll always take it. I find it often unsettles people, more psychological warfare than anything.} Nf4 16. Bxf4 exf4 {Quite happy to ruin my opponents pawn structure.} 17. Qxf4 Qe7 18. O-O-O {Looked brilliant. Double threat on the d pawn right? Wrong.} Bh6 {Oh rats. Well that wasn't quite the phrase I used, but as this version is public we'll stick with that.} 19. Nd5 {Trying to see if I can bully my way out of it.} Bxf4+ {Failing to bully my way out of it.} 20. Nxf4 Qg7 21. Kb1 Ne7 22. Rxd6 Nc8 {Just here I'm still hurumphing over the loss of my queen and wondering how I can fork her and nab hers. When summat occurs to me....} 23. Rd8+ {Can't interpose and the only other move they can make is k-e7, r-d7 and I grab the queen anyway. } Kxd8 24. Ne6+ Ke7 25. Nxg7 Kd6 {Now I'm a much happier Panda. So much so that I want to encourage her to take c6 so I can move B-d5 and baggsie the rook.} 26. Nf5+ Kc7 27. Rd1 {She doesn't fall for it so now I'm going to wander down to d7.} Rh7 {Or not.} 28. a3 Na7 29. Bd5 Rd8 30. Nd4 {Looking at K-e6} Kb6 31. c7 {Trying to gently persuade her to have the pawn.} Rdd7 32. Ne6 {Ok....can I have f8 then instead? She is determined not to fall for any of these....} Rhe7 33. Kc1 h4 34. Rh1 Re8 35. Rxh4 Nc6 36. Rh6 Ne7 37. Bb3 Ng8 38. Rh1 Ne7 39. Rd1 Rxd1+ {Surprised she accepted that exchange, I felt it weakened her position significantly.} 40. Kxd1 Nc8 41. Ke2 Nd6 42. Ke3 Nc4+ 43. Bxc4 bxc4 44. Ng7 Rh8 45. Ne6 Kc6 46. Kd4 Kd6 47. Nc5 Kxc7 48. Nxa6+ {At this point I'd decided to try and force her pawns off and see what she could do with rook vs knight and pawns.} Kb6 49. Nc5 Rd8+ 50. Kxc4 Rd2 51. c3 {Another trap, Rxb2 draws K-a4} Rxf2 52. Nd7+ Kc6 53. Nxf6 Rxf3 {Now its an interesting game. I'm very used to equal/equalish positions, but this is summat of a novelty. Still with 4 pawns I should be able to force the win...I hope.} 54. Nd5 Rf8 55. b4 Re8 56. b5+ Kd6 57. Kd4 Ra8 58. Nb6 {Another trap, begging her to take the pawn and then K-c4} Rb8 59. Nc4+ Ke6 60. a4 Kd7 61. Kd5 Rd8 62. Kc5 Rc8+ 63. Kb4 Re8 64. e5 Ke6 65. a5 Kd5 66. a6 Rc8 {Finally! She grows too ambitious and here is the killer.....} 67. Nb6+ Kxe5 68. Nxc8 Kd5 69. a7 Ke6 70. a8=Q Kf5 71. Qd5+ Kf4 72. Nd6 Kg4 73. Qf5+ Kg3 74. Ne4+ Kg2 75. Qf4 Kg1 76. Qd2 Kh1 77. Qe2 Kg1 78. b6 {Now I'd wanted for the sake of elegance to finish it with queen and knight. But I'm not elegant. And when I try working it out on analyser I kept stalemating. So I chickened, trapped the king in a repeat cycle and went got the other queen. } Kh1 79. b7 Kg1 80. b8=Q Kh1 81. Qbh2# {}
