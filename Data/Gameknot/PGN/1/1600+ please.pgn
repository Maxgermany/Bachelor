1. e4 c5 {sicilian} 2. c3 {becomes alapin now !} e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. cxd4 a6 {1st mistake :wasting one time. Center needs to be whether reconquered or attacked, for example d4 transposes to french opening. No need to be scared of Bb5+.} 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Bd3 d6 {Now it looks like black only want to defend. White will sure attack ! Again d4 would be better.} 7. O-O {open position => fast castling.} h6 {losing one tempo again. White is now a lot ahead in development.} 8. Nc3 Qc7 {why this move ? 2 bishops and 1 noble haven't moved yet, Knight are completely stuck.} 9. Bf4 {move that pawn if you dare now.} e5 10. dxe5 dxe5 11. Nd5 {Queen's got nowhere nice to go.} Qa5 12. Nxe5 {white wants the center and gets it.} Nxe5 {necessary in this case but still an awful move.} 13. Bxe5 Ra7 {?? I still have no idea why that roque came here !?!} 14. Bc3 {where can that queen go now ?} Qd8 15. Re1 {target : the Black King.} Nf6 {only one pawn ahead but the position is just so comfortable. Exchange the noble and get that e-pawn out of the way is sure to win.} 16. Nxf6+ gxf6 17. e5 {get that pawn out!} Be6 {This would have been good, just too late.} 18. Qf3 Be7 {good one again.} 19. exf6 Bc5 {}
