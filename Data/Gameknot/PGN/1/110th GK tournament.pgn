1. d4 d5 2. c4 {I start with the queen's gambit.} dxc4 3. e3 Bf5 4. Bxc4 e6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Bd2 Bxc3 7. Bxc3 {White has a slight lead in development, but his DSB is bad.} Ne7 {Why not f6?} 8. Nf3 Bg4 9. h3 Bxf3 {?! I'm not sure if this is a good move. It trades a bishop for a knight, loses his only active piece and allows my queen to develop.} 10. Qxf3 c6 {White has an edge here. I'm fully developed, have the bishop pair, (although my DSB is still miserable) and I am much more active than black.} 11. O-O b5 {He pushes back my bishop, but he should finish developing.} 12. Bb3 O-O 13. a3 {Gives my LSB an escape hole in case he pushes his a pawn.} Nf5 {! Gets his knight more active. He still needs to develop his other knight though.} 14. Rfe1 Nh4 {?! It does chase my queen, but he *really* needs to finish developing. This also brings his only active piece onto the edge.} 15. Qg3 {? Better would have been g4. This lets him chase my queen again and move back to his earlier spot.} g5 {? And he doesn't. He seems to want to preserve his knight's position on the rim even if it costs him his king safety. I don't see why he doesn't just play Nf5. He would have made his knight more active and chased my queen.} 16. f4 {! Undermining support.} Nf5 {*Now* he moves back, after he's compromised his king safety.} 17. Qg4 f6 {Supporting the advanced g pawn.} 18. Bxe6+ {...But allowing a fork.} Kg7 19. Qxf5 {Now black is in BIG trouble. He's down four points and my bishop and queen are hovering over his king.} Qd6 20. d5 {Defends my LSB and clears the way for my DSB to join the attack.} c5 21. b4 {Preventing him from chasing my DSB.} cxb4 {?? Loses a rook to a skewer.} 22. axb4 {???? I don't spot it until right after I make my move.} Qc7 23. Rac1 {I threaten a discovered attack.} Qb6 24. Bd4 Qd6 {?? And he gives me another chance. This time, I take it.} 25. Bc5 Qd8 26. Bxf8+ Qxf8 {?? Blunder, now he'll lose his queen and soon will be checkmated.} 27. Rc7+ {!} Kh6 {Allows instant mate. He could have drawn it out by blocking with his queen.} 28. Qxh7# {Please comment and rate.}
