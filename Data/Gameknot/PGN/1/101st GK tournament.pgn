1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 5. d3 Bg4 6. d4 exd4 7. Qxd4 Be7 8. Ng5 O-O 9. O-O h6 {black opened his defense and my attention got drawn to h6 ... unfortunately, I was blinded by ambition and tried to get to the h6 square at all costs ... and it cost me the game} 10. Nf3 c5 11. Qd3 Nc6 12. Bf4 Nh5 13. Qd2 {Probably should have moved 13. Bg2} Bxf3 {If i'd move 13. Bg2, I could have made 14. Qxf3 and kept my king-side pawn structure intact} 14. gxf3 {... Instead, I broke up my King's protection and stacked my pawns on the f-file} Nd4 15. Qe3 {This was an obvious blunder.  The move 15. Qd3 would have been much better as it negates the fork that results and protects the c-pawn ... further, if I'd made 13. Bg2, black wouldn't have found this peach of an opening.  This is just a continuation of the error on 13} Nxc2 16. Qd2 Nxa1 17. Rxa1 g5 18. Be3 Qd7 19. Qe2 {Still thinking about a king side attack and I see a potential opening and an opportunity to win my piece back ... unfortunately, I forgot that black is allowed to move his pieces} a6 20. f4 {... a chance to win back my piece ... } Nxf4 {... no, black isn't stupid ...} 21. Qf3 Nh3+ 22. Kf1 g4 23. Qe2 Qc7 {blunder by black ... i'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with that move, but he almost let me back into the game. } 24. Qxg4+ {finally, I get to the king side, only down a piece and have a pretty good arsenal swinging toward the king side ... still have a pretty good shot at this game} Ng5 25. Nd5 Qd8 26. Qh5 b5 27. Be2 Kh7 28. Bd3 c4 29. e5+ {... Again, I forgot that black can move his pieces ... even his pawns.  I think I must have not looked a tthe board very well and thought that I had a double check and that the pawn couldn't take my bishop} Kg8 {... apparently black forgot that he can move his pawns too.} 30. Qxh6 {Another blunder ... I'm a machine!  should have been 30. BC2 to accept the gift from black.  This is again a sign of my king-side blindedness} cxd3 31. Rd1 {I think I was trying to get my rook into the mix. } Rc8 32. Nf6+ Bxf6 33. Bxg5 {}
