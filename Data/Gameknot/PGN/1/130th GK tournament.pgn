[Opening "Reversed Grob (Borg/Basman defence/macho Grob) (B00)"]

1. e4 g5 {Reversed Grob, aka Borg/Basman Defense, or Macho Grob.  Black does surprisingly well with this opening, provided white does not play d4. } 2. d4 {White played d4.  A good response for black is Bg7, according to the database.} Bh6 {http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=5398257&fb=1&mv=4&rnd=0.04544471067449585  Black ultimately gets torn apart in the game above, though was a pawn up at the beginning.} 3. h3 e6 4. Nc3 c6 5. Nf3 Na6 {While black's pawns trap the knight except for Na6, BxNa6 doubles black's pawns.  I'd play Bxa6 as white.} 6. Bxa6 bxa6 7. b4 Rb8 8. a3 Nf6 9. e5 Nd5 {Black risks doubling a second set of pawns.} 10. Nxd5 exd5 11. g4 Rg8 12. Be3 f6 13. exf6 Qxf6 14. Qe2 {With this move white can take Pg5 for free with Bxpg5+.  Black will play Kf7 to protect Bh6.  To defend against this, black should play Kf7 now.  Otherwise, Qe6 gives white Bh6 for free too.  Even better for white would be Bf4+.  The rook at b8 is worth 5 points, while the bishop and pawn add to only four.  More pieces but less aggregate value.  Black could also play Kd8, preserving the Rf8 threat to Nf3.  White's response to that would be Ne5.} a5 15. c3 Rf8 {While it looks like black can make off with Nf3, Bf4+ remains a potent threat. } 16. Bxg5+ {While Bf4 picks off Rb8, black can't take Nf3 after interposing the queen.  Bxg5+ gives white a pawn and bishop, while forcing the black queen off the Nf3 attack.  } Qe6 17. Qxe6+ {I think white would have been better off taking the bishop.  If black traded queens, KxQe2 positions white's king to protect Nf3, AND moves it closer to the middle of the board.  By trading queens black picks off Nf3 (RxNf3), and white's advantage boils down to a single pawn.} dxe6 18. Bxh6 Rxf3 19. Rh2 {What is that?  Nothing is attacking Pf2.  Pc3, however, now looks like toast.} Rxc3 20. f4 Rc4 {Rd3 attacks Pd4 while preserving the rook's mobility.  Of course, white would probably respond with Rd1 or Rd2.  Rd2 would be better, otherwise PxPb4 gives black another pawn.} 21. Bg7 axb4 22. axb4 Rbxb4 23. Rd2 {RxPd4 is not a serious threat because the bishop is cheaper than the rook.  White should have played RxPa7, followed by Be5 some time to block black's pawn progress.  Here black should consider Pa6 or probably better--Ra4.} Rb7 {This doesn't really protect Pa7, because black can counter with Rda2, powering the rooks on the a file.  Black has nothing else to add.  The bishop (Pa6) is a better protector.} 24. Be5 Rb3 25. h4 {Yikes!  While Rh3 or Rg3 might scare black into moving a pawn, following up with Rh1+ (or Rg1+) would give up Ra1.  White would most likely respond with RxPa7, though. } Rcc3 26. Rxa7 Rb1+ 27. Rd1 Re3+ 28. Kd2 Rbb3 29. Rxh7 Rbd3+ 30. Kc2 Rdc3+ 31. Kb2 Rcb3+ 32. Kc2 Rbc3+ 33. Kd2 Rcd3+ 34. Kc2 Rdc3+ 35. Kd2 Ba6 36. Rh8+ Kd7 37. Ra8 Rcd3+ 38. Kc2 Rdc3+ 39. Kb2 Rcb3+ 40. Kc2 Rbc3+ 41. Kb2 Rcb3+ 42. Kc2 Rbc3+ 43. Kb2 Rcb3+ 44. Kc2 Bc4 45. Ra7+ Ke8 46. Ra8+ Kd7 47. Ra7+ Ke8 48. g5 Rbc3+ 49. Kb2 Re2+ {Oh no.  Black could have forced a draw.} 50. Kxc3 Re3+ 51. Kb4 Rb3+ 52. Kc5 Bb5 53. Kd6 Be2 54. Rda1 Rb6 55. Kxe6 Bg4+ 56. Kd6 {}
