1. d4 g6 {Ive been experimenting with 1 g6 as  a  answer to 1 d4 recently.} 2. Bg5 Bg7 3. h3 d6 4. e3 Nf6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Bf4 Nc6 7. Nf3 Bf5 8. Nbd2 d5 9. c3 Ne4 10. O-O a6 11. Re1 b5 12. Nh4 Na5 13. Nxf5 gxf5 14. Nxe4 fxe4 15. f3 exf3 16. Bxf3 Nc4 17. b3 Nb6 18. Qd3 Qd7 19. Bd1 Kh8 20. Bc2 f5 21. Qe2 Rae8 22. Ref1 Nc8 23. Bd3 Nd6 24. Rac1 Ne4 25. Bxe4 fxe4 26. Qh5 e6 27. c4 bxc4 28. bxc4 c6 29. c5 Qf7 30. Qg4 Qg6 31. Qe2 Rea8 {Equal? Black has a doubled pawn on the e file. Material is level.} 32. Rcb1 Rfg8 33. Rf2 Ra7 34. Rb6 Qe8 35. Rxa6 Rb7 {White has won a pawn. I (black) was still hopeful of a positive result.} 36. Qd1 Qd7 37. Qa4 Rc8 38. Ra8 Rb1+ 39. Rf1 Rxf1+ 40. Kxf1 Qb7 41. Rxc8+ Qxc8 {As the pieces come off the significance of the passed pawn at a2 grows.} 42. Qa7 Qf8 43. Qb8 Kg8 44. Qb7 Bxd4 {A saving tactic?} 45. Ke2 Bxc5 46. Qxc6 Kf7 47. Qb7+ Qe7 48. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {I still had hopes of saving this ending though white has a passed pawn on a2 and a 2 to 1 majority on the other wing.} 49. g4 Ba3 50. Be5 Kf7 51. Kd1 Bc5 52. Ke2 Kg6 53. a4 Bb6 54. Bc3 Kg5 55. Be1 e5 56. a5 Ba7 57. Bg3 h5 58. gxh5 Kxh5 59. Bxe5 Kh4 60. Bd4 Bb8 61. a6 Kxh3 62. a7 Bxa7 63. Bxa7 {This is won for white. The king has always to give way in these situations. I could have resigned now but played on a few moves.} Kg4 64. Kd2 Kf5 65. Kc3 Ke5 66. Bc5 Kf6 67. Kd4 Ke6 68. Bb4 {As i said the king has to give way in these situations. White wins the last pawn in the same manner and queens his pawn.  VERY STRONG PLAY BY WHITE ESPECIALLY IN THE ENDING. WELL PLAYED.}
