1. d4 {So this is the second of the "high draws" which my over-the-board team mate vectevs made, which I offered to annotate.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {So it starts as a standard Nimzo-Indian. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence} 4. Bd2 {This is an unusual reply. To quote the Wikipedia article I have just referred to "unpinning the knight, is a move that is common among amateurs who have no theoretical knowledge when they face the Nimzo-Indian. Although the move is not bad, it is unambitious. The strategic aim of obtaining the bishop pair without conceding the doubled pawns fails, for after e.g., 4...Bxc3 5.Bxc3 Ne4, White does not get to keep both bishops, and fair trades are usually not in White's interests since White has an advantage in space."} O-O {This seems a sensible move by black.} 5. a3 {A logical follow-up.} Bxc3 {So black takes.} 6. Bxc3 {White takes back.} Ne4 {And now black ensures white doesn't keep the two bishops.} 7. Qc2 {And white ensures that his c pawns are not doubled.} d5 {This is slightly unusual, in that either f5 or Nxc3 is more common, but I can't see anything wrong with it.} 8. e3 {So white continues with sensible development.} c5 {8....c5 is given as a mistake by the Gameknot computer, which gives the line Nxc3 9. Qxc3 dxc4 10. Qxc4 Bd7 11. Nf3 Bc6 12. Bd3 Bxf3 13. gxf3 Nc6 14. O-O-O Qh4 15. d5 Qxc4+ 16. Bxc4 Ne5. 8....c5 does seem to run the risk of losing a pawn without compensation, unless black is very careful.} 9. dxc5 {Black takes - why not?} Nxc3 {Black takes. Black could have captured the pawn on c5 with his knight. The one game in the Gameknot database with this move is kikso (1691) vs. glacerda (1506) Nxc5 which ended with 10. cxd5 exd5 11. Bxg7 Kxg7 12. Qxc5	b6 13. Qd4+ f6 14. Bd3	Nc6 15. Qh4 Ne5 16. Qxh7#. But there are improvements black could have made, for instance on 10. recapturing with the queen rather than the pawn.} 10. Qxc3 {White recaptures.} Na6 {Black attempted to recapture the pawn.} 11. cxd5 {White does another exchange.} Qxd5 {Black recaptures this way, to double the attack on c5.} 12. b4 {But white simply protects.} Rd8 {Black gains control of the d file, but this shouldn't really be enough compensation.} 13. Nf3 {So white continues with sensible development.} f6 {This is given as the 2nd mistake in the match by the Gameknot computer, which prefers Nc7 14. Be2 Bd7 15. Rd1 Qe4 16. Bd3 Qg4 17. Qd4 Qxd4 18. Nxd4 e5 19. Nf5 Ba4 20. Rd2 Nb5 21. Ne7+ Kf8. There is some logic in f6. With a white squared bishop left, black should be putting his pawns on black squares and black has a plan of e6-e5, but white has a plan of getting rid of queens.} 14. Qd4 {This is a reasonable plan. Be2 followed by Rd1 also seemed quite reasonable to me (maybe on move 13 and 14 instead of Nf3.)} Qxd4 {Black takes.} 15. Nxd4 {White takes back. Also recapturing with the pawn to try and prevent e6-e5 was equally good.} e5 {Black carries out his plan.} 16. Bc4+ {White throws in a check. This is another good move by white, developing with tempo.} Kf8 {The king moves.} 17. Bxa6 {But this is a mistake, exchanging off a poorly placed knight for a well positioned bishop. Gameknot prefers 17. Nb5 Bd7 18. Nd6 Bc6 19. f3 Rab8 20. Rd1 Ba4 21. Rd2 Nc7 22. Bd3 g6 23. O-O Rd7 24. Bc4 Rbd8 25. b5 with an advantage equivalent to two pawns. } exd4 {Black also has this move, taking off black's well-placed knight.} 18. Bc4 {So the bishop retreats.} dxe3 {Black takes again.} 19. fxe3 {White takes back. Gameknot assesses white's advantage to be less than a pawn now (0.86)} Ke7 {Black centralises his king, usually a good idea in endgames.} 20. Rd1 {White wisely contests the open file.} Bg4 {and black doesn't fall in with white's plans. Gameknot doesn't like this, and instead prefers  Rxd1+ 21. Kxd1 Bf5 22. Kd2 Be4 23. Rf1 f5 24. g4 Re8 25. gxf5 Kf6 26. Rf4 Re5 27. Kc3 Bxf5 28. Kd4 Re8} 21. Be2 {Gameknot doesn't like this either and suggests 21. Rd4 Bh5 22. O-O Rd7 23. Bd3 Bg6 24. Bb5 Rxd4 25. exd4 Rd8 26. Re1+ Kf8 27. Rd1 Be4 28. Kf2 Ke7 29. a4} Bxe2 {Gameknot gives this as a third consecutive mistake and suggests Rxd1+ 22. Kxd1 Rd8+ 23. Ke1 Be6 24. Rf1 g6 25. Bf3 Bd5 26. Bxd5 Rxd5 27. Ke2 Ke6 28. e4 Rd8 29. Ke3 Ke5 30. b5} 22. Rxd8 {White wisely exchanges rooks.} Rxd8 {Black takes back.} 23. Kxe2 {and white takes back. Gameknot gives white's advantage as plus 1.19.} Rd5 {Black moves his rook to a more active square.} 24. Rd1 {White wisely contests the open file.} Rg5 {Gameknot computer gives this as a mistake and gives the variation Rxd1 25. Kxd1 f5 26. Ke2 Ke6 27. Kf3 Ke5 28. h3 h6 29. g3 g5 30. Ke2 Ke4 31. h4 gxh4 32. gxh4 f4 33. exf4 Kxf4 but white is clearly winning here - it is a simply won king and pawn ending. (As Fritz will verify!) So the Gameknot computer is completely wrong here.} 25. g3 {White simply protects the pawn.} h5 {Black wisely tries to exchange a pawn.} 26. e4 {White advances his e pawn.} h4 {Black carries on with his plan.} 27. Rd5 {White again tries to exchange into a won pawn ending.} Rg6 {And black is having none of it.} 28. Kf3 {So white protects g3.} hxg3 {Black takes.} 29. hxg3 {White takes back.} Rh6 {Black seeks to attack down the h file.} 30. Kf4 {Black advances the king.} Rh1 {Black penetrates.} 31. Rd3 {White defends.} Rf1+ {Black checks.} 32. Rf3 {White defends.} Re1 {Black of course still can't allow the exchange of rooks.} 33. g4 {White advances.} Ke6 {Black's king comes up.} 34. Re3 {This is given as a mistake by the Gameknot computer, which prefers 34. Rc3 Rf1+ 35. Ke3 Re1+ 36. Kf3 Rf1+ 37. Ke2 Rg1 38. c6 bxc6 39. Rxc6+ Ke5 40. Rc7 Rxg4 41. Re7+ Kd6 42. Rxa7 Rxe4+ 43. Kd3 Re7 e44. Rxe7 and gives white's advantage as plus 0.71. Gameknot also likes rc3, but gives white's advanatge as less - at plus 0.59.} Rf1+ {Black checks.} 35. Rf3 {White blocks.} Re1 {Black offers a repeat.} 36. Re3 {Which white accepts. I get the impression that white may have played on, if he were not playing an opponent rated about 350 rating points ahead!  To answer my friend's question "Be interesting to know if you think I played particularly well or if my opponent made major blunders." Yes, I think black did make major blunders in the opening, and white played skillfully to take advantage of them, to become a clear pawn up. I think black was too much of a hurry to exchange minor pieces with 17. Bxa6 after which it became harder to convert the extra pawn. In the endgame black played skillfully to avoid defeat.  Anyway, many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two, let me know how I am doing with my annotations, and grade this annotation on the star system. Until next time dear reader!}
