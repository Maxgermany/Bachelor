[Opening "QGD Slav (D11), 4.e3"]

1. d4 {Kanie starts off with the Queen's pawn openings.  I wasn't sure how getoverit was going to respond.} d5 {But, once getoverit played this, I was pretty sure that it was going to be QG since that's a well known opening.  Of course, it could also become the Colle's Franketort System or the London System, along with other things.  But, the most common response is QG.} 2. c4 c6 {The Slav Defense is also how I respond to the QG.} 3. Nf3 {Kanie develops a piece.} Nf6 {As does getoverit.} 4. e3 {Opening up a line for his Bf1, as well as, establishing a solid pawn chain.  But, I would've opened up a similar line by fianchettoing with 4.g3.} e6 {And, getoverit has the same idea in mind.  Similarly, I would've fianchetto'd with 4...g6.} 5. b3 {This is where, however, Kanie finachettos.  So, there's got to be something that I'm not seeing.  I just don't know what that is.} Ne4 {Centralizing his N which is generally a good way to go about.} 6. Bd3 {Threatening to exchange.  So, my inference is that exchanging benefits Kanie here.} Bb4+ {That's why I'm not surprised to see getoverit place white in check.} 7. Nbd2 {Not wanting to exchange B's, though, this is how Kanie gets out of check.  And, I would've done the same thing here.} f5 {I don't see the point behind this move.  The only reason being is that it appears to weaken the King since getoverit has advanced his weakest pawn on the chess board, similar to what I see in TA's blitz Q sac.} 8. O-O {With that being said, I am not surprised to see Kanie castle here.  In fact, I like it because the K is safe here.} Nd7 {But, getoverit, however, delays it by developing another piece.} 9. Bb2 {Taking advantage of his fianchetto by placing the B there.  I think along the same line when it comes to the fianchettos.} O-O {This is where getoverit decides to castle, at once.} 10. a3 {Meanwhile, Kanie decides to kick the B.  It has to be for tempo gain, as well as, maintaining a semi open file, in the process.} Bd6 11. b4 {I think that Kanie is planning to attack again.  Although, white could've played 11.c5 right away.  But, by playing this first, the plan would be adding to the pawn chain.} Qf6 {getovert decides to bring his Q into play, at once.  } 12. Qc2 {And, Kannie does the same thing.} g5 {I don't see the point behind this move.  This appears to weaken the King.  That's why I would not have considered this move.  Instead, I would've fianchetto'd the undeveloped B with 12...b6 to allow 13...Bb7 followed by 14...Rad8 or 14...Rae8 with the idea of centralizing a R.  That would have been the plan.  } 13. Be2 {I also don't why Kanie retreated, given that his B was not attacked.} Qg7 {Unlike before, I do see the point.  But, I would have held off until white Nf3 has moved.  The plan is 14...Qh6, followed by 15...g4, as that forces white to lose a piece to prevent a checkmate on h2.} 14. g3 {But, Kanie puts a stop to that by opening up a window for his monarch.} h5 {So, getoverit comes up with a different plan being a pawn storm.} 15. Rab1 {I don't know why Kanie played this.  Instead, I would've centralized with 15.Rad1.} h4 {But, I do see the logic is.  The plan behind this move is to expose white's King.  I saw the same thing unfold in Charleshiggie's mini tournament between him and brigadecommander.  And, this is how Charles defeated Janet.  And, I annotated that game a while back.} 16. b5 {However, Kanie has plans of his own.} cxb5 {I would've captured with 16...hxg3 because if white plays 17.hxg3, black go on a K side assault with 17...Qh6.} 17. cxd5 exd5 18. Bxb5 Ndf6 {Avoiding an exchange, getoverit moves his N.  And, this is exactly what I would've also played.  However, Kanie is still going to exchange the other N.  Personally, I don't see how this benefits him since that's what he wants.  But, I can't find anything else for white, though.} 19. Nxe4 fxe4 20. Ne5 {Kanie still wants the exchange.} Bh3 {But, this is where getoverit really goes on the offense.  I am very familiar with this pattern even though the Q isn't there.  However, my being familiar makes me realize that despite material being even, black has an advantage.  And, it's not hard to believe because fiercequeen told me that it's not mostly about who's ahead or not material wise.  It's instead, about who has a space advantage or extra tempo.  In this context, getoverit has the space advantage.} 21. Rfd1 {Kanie centralizes his R, but that doesn't change what I said before as I still favor getoverit's position.} Qh7 {And, this is what I was talking about with the B landing on h3.  Usually the Q hit's this area first, but doing it later doesn't change anything.  It shows that Kanie's K side is somewhat weak.} 22. Be2 {Mu guess is that Kanie is trying to strengthen it.} Qf5 {But, getoverit just adds to the attack.} 23. Rd2 {I am not sure why Kanie played this because he isn't going to double on the d file with his other R.  In my opinion, this is where white really starts getting in trouble.  It turns out that what I was worried about happens on getoverit's next move.  And, as noted, charleshiggie won against brigadecommander in a very similar way.} hxg3 24. hxg3 Rac8 {I was expecting something like 24...Qh7.  But, this is even more powerful.} 25. Qb3 Rc7 {getoverit is planning to do something with that R.  I'm just not sure what because he doesn't play 26...Rh7 which is what I anticipate.} 26. Re1 {I don't see the point behind this move.  Instead, I would've played 26.Rbd1.} Kh8 {I also don't understand this move.} 27. Qd1 {I also don't know why Kanie played this.  I, at first, thought that it would be 27.Qh5+.  But, that was never going to be possible, even if the B moved due to blacks Nf6.} Rh7 {But, this is what I thought getoverit was going to play earlier.  As he has a lot going on in the K side.} 28. g4 {Trying to stop it, Kanie attacks the Q.  But, this doesn't phase getoverit, at all.} Qe6 29. f3 {Kanie attempts to exchange pawns, as it looks nasty.  But, getoverit has a plan of his own.} Nxg4 {As this is the sac that I was talking about.} 30. fxg4 {?? Kanie took the bait.  I usually don't mark moves, but I believe that this is where white wrong.  I mean black did have an advantage, but this is the losing move, in my opinion because of what happens next.  And, yes, this is also where I saw the same type of pattern with GM Bobby Fischer when he played against GM Donald Byrne.  As Byrne brought his Q out early.  This allowed Fischer to sac his Q.  And, when Byrne took it, Fischer had a mating sequence which he took advantage and delivered a checkmate.} Qh6 {With that being said, Kanie resigned here.  The idea being is that getoverit is going to capture g pawn.  No matter how white responds, black's next move would be 32...Qh2# which is checkmate.  The only despute to mating on h2 would be for white to move his Be2, but black still mates with 32...Qh1#}
