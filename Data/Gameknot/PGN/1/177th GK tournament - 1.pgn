1. e4 {This game is not vary long but the reason I like it is that the ratings are very different and I was the underdog } e5 2. d3 Nf6 3. Bg5 Bc5 {this move is very aggressive and it could be dangerous for him} 4. Bxf6 {this is a wrong move because it allows mass development for me> and could prove a very lethal attack for me} Qxf6 5. f3 {this is not a very strong move but not bad} Qb6 6. b3 {here is where he goes wrong and lets my bishop in to a very weak spot!} Bf2+ {I take the opening } 7. Kd2 Qe3+ {this attack is going to prove to be very fruit full for me and will allow me to get his queen if played write } 8. Kc3 Qd4+ 9. Kd2 Qxa1 {here I go for the rook and point advantage } 10. Kc1 {BIG MASTAK!!!! this allows me to win his queen do you know how in one move  } Be3+ 11. Qd2 Bxd2+ {after this he resined and I won and this boosted my rating since he was in the 1200 after many games}
