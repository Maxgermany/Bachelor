1. f4 {bird } Nf6 {preventing e4} 2. e3 {not the best, in case of an aggressive e5 I would be in problems. } d6 {preparing e5} 3. Nf3 {anticipating e5} Nbd7 {preparing e5} 4. d4 {anticipating e5} c5 {kicking the stonewall} 5. c3 {main line defense} a6 {preventing Bb5 and maybe preparing queen side attack} 6. Bd3 {controlling e4} b5 {queen side attack !} 7. a3 {preventing b4} Qb6 {strange move : anticipating 0-0 and preparing his attack, but my centre is still strong. Maybe preparing 0-0-0} 8. O-O Bb7 {dangerous fianchetto, i will have to be very careful with this lsb} 9. b4 {I giving him the choice between loosing his pressure on d4 (c5xb4) or close the queen side (c5 c4), i think the better black answer would be c5 x d4, weakening my stonewall. But he preferred to close, what was the best option for me. I think this was a tactical mistake} c4 {removing my lsb, but this is not a problem} 10. Bc2 d5 {?! :  what was the black plan there ? now he has closed completely the queen side witch is in my advantage because I can now attack the king side quietly  and the dangerous black lsb fianchetto is now cancelled.} 11. Ne5 {conventional attack (11. ...  Nxe5 12.fxe5 and open the f colon)} e6 {this e6 pawn will not stay there for a long, I will use my f4 pawn to exchange it in order to open the king side and open a gap.} 12. Nxd7 {first a exchange knights in order to be able to bring my queen to the battle field (black will surely retake with the f6 knight witch is the guardian of h5 square...) } Nxd7 13. f5 {second : kick e6 in order to exchange it } O-O-O {0-0-0, but the king will be very exposed there ...} 14. fxe6 fxe6 15. Qg4 {the queen is active now. I have to bring the b1 knight quickly} Nf6 16. Qh3 {maintain pressure on e6} Be7 {weakening g7, } 17. Nd2 {freeing the knight} Kb8 {bad choice :  I will use it moving the queen on g3+} 18. e4 {not very good, if black accept, i'm loosing because i'm 2 against 3} Bc8 {I'm not afraid by this discovered attack to the queen because i will move on g3+ witch will give a tempo} 19. exd5 exd5 20. Qg3+ {wining g7 (witch could be dangerous because it will open at the same time the g colon against my castle, I'll have to manage with it)} Bd6 21. Qxg7 Rhg8 {blunder : loosing the knight} 22. Qxf6 Bxh2+ {not a problem} 23. Kh1 Rd6 24. Qf7 {so I'm now threatening the rook and the dsb} Be6 {wining the h pawn} 25. Qxh7 Rd7 {blunder : loose dsb} 26. Qxh2+ {and i have a tempo to secure my queen (danger is Rh8 or h7 if they are protected)} Ka7 27. Qe5 {preventing rh8 and avoid to have my queen pined. So at this time blacks resign. I hope you have enjoyed this game.}
