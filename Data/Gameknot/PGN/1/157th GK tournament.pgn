1. d4 {Opponent is Matus from SLO 34 yrs old.  He scored 5.0 in Round #1. In this R2 game I was neck and neck with horsekis so these last 2 games vs colorman needed to be wins to take clear 1st place.} Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 Bg4 {Game note: "Not 6...Nxe4 7.Qa4+ (fork)" } 7. h3 Bh5 8. Nc3 Na6 {Game note: "8...Na6!? ooooh".  If I remember correctly I was going to re-position to c7.  Didn't matter anyway because of his next move which surprised me.  So bad move on my part.  10...Nd7 might have helped but I sure wasn't thinking that way.} 9. Bxa6 bxa6 10. O-O Be7 11. Qa4+ Nd7 12. g4 Bg6 13. Qxa6 O-O 14. Bf4 Qb6 {Admitting I'm stuck.} 15. Qxb6 Nxb6 16. Rfe1 h6 {Computer starts calling for R to d- or b-files.  I guess b-file would have been good.  His next move forces the d-file.} 17. Nb5 Rfd8 18. Rad1 a6 19. Nxd6 {Game note: "19.Nxd6!? may prove to be an interesting sacrifice to get his centre pawns moving.  I'll need to slow his pawn advance with ...f6 or something like that."  Computer calls it a mistake.  19.Nc3 perfectly fine.  After the text, 20.e5 Bf8 21.d6 looks better.} Bxd6 20. Bxd6 Rxd6 21. a3 {This move misses the point.} a5 22. Rdc1 Re8 {Game note: "22...Nc4 to threaten ...Rae8 attack on his e4 pawn.  Also attacks his b2 pawn immediately but loses mobility.  Result is I control 2 centre squares vs 4." } 23. Nd2 f6 {Game note: "23...f6.  I control 7 centre squares vs 3"} 24. f4 {Game note: "24.f4 my B is key but Rc8 (25.Nb3 perhaps) is almost forced.  It's unclear to me if 24...Bf7".  Computer analysis shows text move and 24...Bf7 are not a priority but evaluate close to the same as the best computer move 24...Rdd8 -0.87.  Also 24...a4 and ...c4.  Seems a little over-confident to me because he has Nb3.} Rc8 25. Nb3 Na4 26. Re2 Ra6 {Game not: "...Ra6 if he moves away I get his e-pawn.  After 27...Rb6 she's about to open up.  If 28.Nxc5 Nxc5 (maybe Rxb2) if 28.Nxa5 Nxb2 (maybe Rxb2) if 28.Rxa4 Rxb3 29.Rxa5 Rxh3"  Post computer analysis gets tricky here but I think I played not too bad.  Could be a turning point here toward the endgame.} 27. Rc4 Rb6 28. Rxa4 Rxb3 29. Kg2 {Game note: "29.Kg2 so much for my planning.  And what's he doing BTW.  He has to get behind his passed pawn.  Anyway I just learned I need 1 of 2 points from this 2 game match vs colorman in order to tie for first in this 2nd round. So I'm gonna motor my pawn if he doesn't want to move his... 29...c4 and I even have the resource ...Rxb2 because on ...c3 he cannot play Rc2 or Rb1 on account of the fork ...Bxe4 so my c-pawn keeps plowing!"} c4 30. Rxa5 {Game note: "30.Rxa5 who cares, see my last note.  A small price to pay... that's why they call them pawns."} Rxb2 31. Rxb2 {Game note: "Doesn't he see the power of ...c3?"  If 32.Rc2 then ...Bxe4+ fork} c3 32. Re2 c2 33. Rxc2 Bxe4+ 34. Kg3 Bxc2 {Computer suggests I use my R to re-capture.  Probably to get behind his pawn and allow for checks etc...} 35. d6 Rd8 {Game note: "35...Rd8 then get the B down to g6-e7 or something like that"} 36. Ra6 Bg6 37. a4 Be8 38. Kf3 Kf7 39. f5 g6 40. Ke4 gxf5+ 41. gxf5 Ra8 {Game note: "41...Ra8 obvious fork if 42.Rxa8 Bc6"} 42. Rxa8 Bc6+ 43. Kd4 Bxa8 44. Kc5 Ke8 45. a5 Kd7 46. h4 Be4 47. a6 Bxf5 48. a7 Be4 {Game note: "48...Be4 looking pretty stale."} 49. Kd4 f5 50. Ke5 h5 51. a8=Q Bxa8 52. Kxf5 Kxd6 53. Kg5 Bf3 54. Kh6 {Game note: "54.Kh6?? allows me to get my K around to capture his last pawn.  He's finished."} Ke5 55. Kg5 Bg4 56. Kg6 Kf4 57. Kf6 Kg3 58. Kg5 Kh3 59. Kf4 Kxh4 60. Ke3 Kg3 61. Kd2 h4 62. Ke1 Kg2 63. Kd2 h3 64. Ke3 h2 65. Kf4 h1=Q {Game note: "65...h1=Q just don't stalemate."  Took me 8 moves.  Computer says 6 if he plays Kxg4 which he did.  I wanted to pinch him off and keep him on the g- and h-files but computer says 66...Qf1.  Even with so it should have been mate in 7 and I got 8.  Not bad.} 66. Kxg4 Qf1 67. Kh4 {67.Kh4 makes my job easier.  Computer says Kg5 best but still forced mate.} Qf4+ {67...Qb4 best, forces 68.Kg4 Qe5 69.Kh4 Kf3.} 68. Kh5 Kg3 {68...Qf6 69.Kg4 Qe5.  I played pretty close to perfect endgame.  Not difficult with such an advantage and no pressure except} 69. Kg6 Kg4 70. Kh7 Kg5 71. Kg7 Qf5 72. Kg8 Kg6 73. Kh8 Qf8# {Another lucky win.}
