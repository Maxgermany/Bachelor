1. e4 Nc6 {Nimzoich Defense. } 2. b3 {White does ok with d4 or Nf3.  Not so much this one.} Nf6 3. g3 {Pe4 left undefended. } Nxe4 4. Qf3 Ng5 5. Qg4 h6 6. Qf4 e5 7. Qf5 {Moving the queen around let's black develop.  White ends up moving the queen eight times in a row, permitting black enormous control of the center. } d6 8. Qd3 Nb4 {White should not leave Pc2 undefended.} 9. Qc3 Nd5 10. Qd3 Nb4 11. Qc4 a5 {Be6 might have been better.} 12. f4 exf4 13. gxf4 d5 14. Qd4 {OMG no!  The queen is lost by knight fork, king, queen, rook. } Nxc2+ 15. Kd1 Bf5 {Uh, no, I think NxQ is suggested here.} 16. fxg5 {Like what is Nc2?  Chopped liver?} h5 {NxQ!  NxQ!  White should play Qe5+, followed by QxBf5 if black interposes the black bishop.  If black chooses the white bishop, obviously KxNc2.  Black will most likely select the queen. }
