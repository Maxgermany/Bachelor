[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C60), Cozio defence"]

1. e4 {Opponent from Belgium goes for the Lopez - Cozio.  I get aggressive with my B's and even offer sacrifices which proves to myself that I need to maintain initiative to win games.  Passive, defensive positions don't seem to get me much success.  The final mate was somewhat pretty.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nge7 4. c3 a6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 h6 7. O-O Ng6 8. d4 exd4 9. cxd4 Bb7 10. Nc3 Bb4 {11.Bxf7!? possible on account of his re-capture ...Kxf7 12.Qb3+ forking the K and his b4 B.  Anyway I didn't really see it at the time and played soundly with a3.} 11. a3 Ba5 12. Ba2 O-O 13. b4 Bb6 14. Be3 d6 {I control 9 central squares vs his 5.  My following Q move takes advantage of his mis-placed K-side N.} 15. Qd2 Kh8 {I don't find this to be a good move so I offered the following B sac that he didn't take.} 16. Bxh6 Kh7 17. Be3 f6 {His K-side is Swiss cheese now.} 18. Qe2 Nge7 19. Ng5+ {19.Ng5+! if he captures my N with 19...fxg5 it's mate 20.Qh5#. Then my N can move on to various forks and windmills.  Another common theme that the chess tactics training has helped me to see these hidden advantages.} fxg5 20. Qh5# {}
