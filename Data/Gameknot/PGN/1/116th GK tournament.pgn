[Opening "QGD (D35), exchange, positional line, 5...c6"]

1. d4 {So, white starts conventionally with the Queen's Pawn Opening.} d5 {As anticipated, and it will turn into a Queens Gambit.} 2. c4 e6 {Which black declines.  I would've declined with the Semi Slav, so 2...c6 because I don't enjoy having my Bc8 restricted.} 3. Nc3 {Now that his c pawn has advanced, this move is perfectly safe, and it develops.} Nf6 {Black has the same idea.  White, however, will respond by exchanging a pawn.} 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 {Pinning the Nf6.} c6 {I'm not sure why black played this, but I would've broken the pin and continued to develop with 5...Be7.} 6. e3 {Opening up a line for his Bf8.} h6 {I still would've played 6...Be7  However, this used to be my response to a pin.  But, Jack Stockel has told me that it's better to break with your B then a pawn.  That's not always the case, but in general.  That is, when your Knight is pinned by his or her Bishop.} 7. Bh4 Bf5 {?? Completing his development.  But, reversion thinks that this is the losing move which is why I'm giving it two queries.  In it, he said, ..."7...Be7 is probably Black's best option there, having in mind something like 8.Bd3 Ne4 9.Bxe7 Nxc3 10.Bxd8 Nxd1 11.Rxd1 Kxd8, with a likely draw."} 8. Qf3 {Trying to get his Bf5.} Bg6 {Which black prevents.  But, white however, is going to exchange his B's, followed by, the Q's.} 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. Qxf6 gxf6 11. Nf3 {Developing another piece.} Nd7 {So does black.} 12. Nh4 {I don't know why white decided to place his N on the rim or move the same piece twice, for that matter.  Sometimes, they're allright, but I question it, in this position.  Instead, I would've completed my development, by bringing my Bf1 into play.} Nb6 {Bringing his N into a better outpost, so that it's not left in a cramped position.} 13. f4 {I don't know why white played this.  I would've developed my LSB, though.  There are some things that I, still, haven't been able to figure out.  That's why I enjoy annotating games, like this.} Bh7 {I'm also not sure why black played this.} 14. Kf2 {I don't see the point behind this move.  It's going to prevent white from castling, and this is not an endgame, yet.} Kd7 {I feel the same way about this move.} 15. h3 {This doesn't develop, but white gets a pawn chain.  Under that ground, I do see the point.} Re8 {Centralizing his Rook.} 16. f5 {Stopping his doubled pawns from advancing.} h5 {But, I don't know why black moved here.} 17. Re1 {However, white centralizes his Rook.} Bh6 {Completing his development.} 18. g4 {Fianchettoing his Bishop, even he will not play Bg2.  However, it gives him a solid pawn chain.} Nc8 {Finding a better placement for his N, which we'll see shortly.} 19. Bd3 {Meanwhile, white completes his development.} Nd6 {Redeploying his N.  But, I don't understand why it's better here then on b6.} 20. Ng2 {Finding a better placement for his N, as well.} Bg8 {This time, I don't see the point behind black's move.  It undevelops his LSB.} 21. Kf3 {I also don't understand the point behind this, as we haven't approached the endgame, yet.} Bg5 {Getting an open file for his Rook, which is known to be useful.} 22. Nf4 {As noted, it's better placed.  The logic is that it's better on f4, then on the rim.  Meanwhile, black will waist no time in exchanging.  Now, I don't argue with reversion because he knows a lot.  My personal opinion is that this is where black will appear to go wrong.  That's because tactical-abyss implied that one thing you don't want to do is exchange, where the opponent has an open file, as it leaves the Rook better placed.} hxg4+ 23. hxg4 Rh6 {My guess is that white wants to exchange.  But, I don't know why as it appears to be more beneficial to akjoltoy.} 24. Rxh6 Bxh6 25. b4 {If, he were to play 25.Nh5, it would make sense.  But, in this position, his pawn has advanced, but we're not seeing a pawn chain, though.} a6 {I don't know why this was played.  As black, I would've answered with 25...Ke7, in case, white intended to play Nh5, and take.  Though, experienced know how to handle something this.  But, at my level, I wouldn't except to add a defender.} 26. Na4 {Threatening 27.Nb6+ which appears to be quite nasty.} Kc7 {So, black stops that, cold.} 27. Rc1 {Therefore, white makes another threat, by adding another attacker.} Kb8 {Which black stops.} 28. Nc5 {But, has a overwhelming advantage with this move.  So, despite it appearing even, black is lost.} Re7 {Therefore, he resigns.  Since it appears drawish, to me, I studied this, as Homework to figure out why black resigned.  And, I used a similar type of analysis that I used in that previous HW, when annotating the game against Jack Stockel.  This time, I think I have the right reason.  As it turns out, with white's passed pawns, Rc1, and Nc5, in order to avoid mate, black would be forced to give up a pawn and a piece, without compensation.  Therefore, the game would, likely, continue with 29.Bxa6, bxa6 30.Nxa6+, Kb7 31.Nc5+, Kb6 32.a4, Ka7 33.Rb1, Rb7, 34.b5, cxb5 35.axb5, with no way out, afterwards.  }
